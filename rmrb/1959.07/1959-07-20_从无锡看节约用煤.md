    Looking at Coal Conservation from Wuxi
    Di Jingxiang

    Coal is the "grain" of industry. Without coal for power, the vast majority of machines cannot operate, transportation cannot function, and the metallurgical industry must shut down its furnaces. Judging from the materials provided at the recent coal conservation experience exchange meeting held in Wuxi City, grasping the link of coal conservation is equivalent to grasping the key to production.

    The production of coal in East China, like the rest of the country, has leaped forward in recent years. Actual production in 1957 was 15.32 million tons, which rapidly leaped to 33.96 million tons in 1958, an increase of more than double. Although production has developed so rapidly, it still cannot keep up with demand. Therefore, everyone has a deeper understanding of the necessity of conserving coal. This is not only to ensure that the increased coal production is used properly and achieves greater economic results, but also to start from the practice of strict economy, so that a relative balance can be achieved in a more planned and proportional way between the production and demand sectors of coal, and to arrange the coal used in industry, agriculture and people's lives more rationally, so that all departments of the national economy can develop accordingly. In particular, the various industrial zones and departments that use a large amount of coal, most of which do not produce coal themselves, need to be transported from distant mining areas. Therefore, from the perspective of these regions and departments, coal conservation has even greater significance. Within half a year, Wuxi City actively adopted various methods to save more than 43,000 tons of coal, equivalent to 70% of the city's monthly coal consumption. This amazing achievement is the best illustration.
              Three Ways Wuxi Saves Coal

    The biggest enlightenment from Wuxi City's experience is that there is great potential to be tapped in conserving coal. Any department that fully mobilizes the masses and actively carries out technological innovation can find many ways to save coal. These methods can be summarized into the following three main aspects:

    First, reduce coal consumption and conserve coal. In this regard, the gap between the advanced and the backward is very large. For example, the coal consumption per 10,000 bricks at the Wuxi Linong Brick and Tile Factory is 0.45 tons, while at the Wuxi Brick and Tile Factory it is 0.935 tons, a difference of more than double. Furthermore, the coal consumption per 1,000 meters of vulcanized plain cloth at the Shanghai Renfeng Printing and Dyeing Factory is 91.69 kilograms, while at the Dagong Printing and Dyeing Factory it is 204.89 kilograms, a difference of 120%; the No. 2 converter of Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 3 uses 191.36 kilograms of coke to make one ton of steel, while Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 2 uses 354.6 kilograms; taking the coal washing-to-coke ratio of local coke oven plants, which consume a large amount of coal, the advanced ones, such as the various factories in Wuxi, are between 71% and 72%, and the Xuecheng Coke Plant in Shandong has even reached a level of 72.5%-73.5%, while the Nanjing Steel Plant, Zhejiang Banshan Iron and Steel Plant, etc., are generally between 65% and 68%, with a difference of 8%-13% in coal consumption per ton of coke. The net coke ratio for ironmaking in Wuxi small blast furnaces (13 and 15 cubic meters) averaged 1.268 tons in May and 1.302 tons from February to May, which translates to 3.13 to 3.21 tons of raw coal for coke. However, the coal consumption per ton of pig iron in various provinces and cities in East China, except for Shanghai and Jiangsu, is generally more than 4 tons. If the average can be reduced to 3.5 tons, then approximately one million tons of raw coal for coke can be saved in the second half of the year. For example, for cooking coal, the average coal consumption per person in Wuxi Maternity and Child Health Hospital is 3 liang and 8 qian and 9 fen, while general canteens still remain between 12 liang and 14 liang. If the backward departments can learn from the advanced ones, or approach the advanced level, an average of 8%-10% of coal can be saved in the second half of the year, and the entire East China region can save more than 2.8 million tons of coal.

    Second, substitute and mix in white coal and substandard coal. In order to ensure the quality of steel, the amount of coal washing and coking is increasing daily. Many areas have not made good use of the inferior coal (including peat) and coke fines after coal washing. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently about 500,000 tons of inferior coal and coke fines stockpiled and unused. If we roughly estimate the entire East China region, inferior coal accounts for 20% of the raw coal fed into washing, so there could be more than 1.5 million tons of resources in the second half of the year; coke fines account for 12% (total for coke plants and coke-using departments), so there would also be about 600,000 tons in the second half of the year. This is a very considerable source of coal. The white coal produced in East China and transferred in accounts for about one-sixth of the total resources. Some provinces and cities that transfer in white coal have a higher proportion. Therefore, the experience of using white coal to replace bituminous coal is an effective and realistic way to solve the current shortage of bituminous coal. Furthermore, coal substitutes such as peat and rice husks, if resources are abundant, can also solve a big problem.

    Third, rationally recover waste heat and waste steam and comprehensively utilize coal. This is another important aspect of conservation. For example, Wuxi Silk Factory No. 1 uses the waste water after boiling cocoons in the cocoon boiling workshop and the waste steam from the rewinding workshop to preheat the cold water sent to the boiler. Generally, in summer, it can increase the water temperature by 13°-15℃, and in winter it can increase the water temperature by more than 20℃ (compared to the original temperature of the cold water). This not only saves coal but also extends the life of the boiler. Approximately 60%-70% of the gas from small blast furnaces for ironmaking is lost, except for what is used to heat the hot blast stove. Wuxi has initially used this gas to heat water heaters to provide steam for furnace top insulation and living purposes; it can also be used to roast ore to reduce sulfur content (roasting once can remove about 40%-50% of sulfur). This not only saves 1,000 tons of coal per month, but also allows the blast furnace to consume hot feed, thereby reducing the coke ratio. In general, the work of recovering coal tar from local coke ovens has many problems. In order to increase the coal tar recovery rate, Wuxi has connected a group of local kilns with a main and branch pipeline for coal gas, using an exhaust fan to uniformly extract the coal gas and uniformly cool and recover the coal tar. The recovery rate is increased by 0.1%-0.2% compared to the single-linked type. Currently, the city can recover 50 tons of coal tar per month, and plans to strive to reach more than 80 tons. If all local coke ovens in East China can recover coal tar and reach the recovery level of Wuxi City, and strive to catch up with the recovery rate of 0.6% of the Xuecheng Coke Plant in Shandong, it will be a considerable wealth.
                Saving Coal is Inseparable from Technological Innovation

    Of course, to save a large amount of coal is not an easy task. According to the experience of Wuxi and various provinces and cities, the conservation and substitution of coal are inseparable from mass technological innovation. Because conservation and substitution must not only ensure that the coal-using departments meet the requirements of improving output and quality, but also conform to the principles of reducing costs and continuously improving economic results, it is necessary to humbly learn from the advanced measures in various places, continuously summarize the advanced experiences of this region and department, improve the existing technical equipment based on realistic possibilities, and improve operating techniques. For example, in order to meet the requirements of improving the quality and output of coke, the coal washing and coking units in Wuxi City began to build simple coal washing machines in July last year. Based on the actual situation of the city, they learned and adopted the design capacity and eccentric shaft wheel structure of the simple coal washing machine of the Tangshan Xinsheng Coke Plant, and utilized the advantages of the simple and inexpensive wooden body structure of the Xuecheng Coke Plant in Shandong. At the same time, in order to improve labor productivity and coal washing effect, they imitated the pre-process of the coal washing machine of the Shanghai Wusong Gas Plant, such as vibrating screens, coarse crushers, and elevators. In their own words: "In this way, we learned from each other's strengths and manufactured the simple coal washing machine that we use now by adapting to local conditions." Its characteristics are that it saves materials, requires little investment, and has good results. Each unit can wash about 30 tons of raw coal per hour. Under normal circumstances, the ash content of washed coal accounts for about 50% to 60% of the ash content of raw coal. The recovery rate of refined coal is also relatively high. The recovery rate of refined coal from Jiawang Coal can reach 78.13%, and the recovery rate of Kailuan Coal can reach 62.45%. The washing cost is about 8 jiao and 5 fen per ton. The average labor productivity per person per day (including transportation workers) is 5 tons. In addition, a series of reforms have also been carried out in production management and coal washing operations. The coking rate can reach 72%. The ash content, calculated on a dry basis, is generally around 14.92%, the sulfur content is less than 1%, and the drum strength is estimated to be around 280 kg. All these reforms not only greatly saved coal, but also helped to improve output, quality, and reduce costs.
              Strengthen Leadership and Grasp All Walks of Life

    In addition to the smelting sector, Wuxi City also focused on industrial sectors with high coal consumption such as power generation, transportation, bricks and tiles, lime and refractory materials, ceramics, and glass, and comprehensively launched a mass movement to save coal. Their experience is mainly to replace all or part of bituminous coal with white coal, inferior coal, peat (also called mud coal), and substandard coal. Boilers for domestic use can all burn white coal or mixed coal (substandard coal mixed); boilers for general industrial use can also all burn or be mixed with some white coal and mixed coal; white coal can also be used to roast forgings, burn lime, and make bricks and tiles. The vertical kiln of Wuxi Linong Brick and Tile Factory uses 75% white coal to burn bricks. Because it has mastered the characteristics of white coal, such as high ignition point, short flame, and large air volume requirement, the operation has been improved accordingly. The coal consumption per 10,000 eighty-five bricks has been reduced from 0.48 tons when using all bituminous coal to 0.45 tons, and there is very little secondary coal at the bottom of the kiln; black bricks only account for 1.25%. Not only can substandard coal be used in general industries, but even in the modern Nanchang Power Plant, burning low-quality coal has been successful. This year, the plant mixed in 85% of Pingxiang low-quality coal, and the cost and coal consumption are lower than last year.

    Since saving coal is a comprehensive mass movement, it must have strong organizational leadership. Wuxi City has also provided good experience in this regard. First, the Party Committee attached importance to it, and leaders at all levels personally took charge. The Municipal Party Committee established a coal conservation office to specifically lead this work. Second, under the direct leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, the coal supply plan for each unit was arranged, and the "variety to the household" and "quantity to the household" were achieved every month. The Municipal Party Committee and the various coal-using units were able to have a clear understanding of the supply and consumption of coal. The third is to cultivate typical examples, make models, hold on-site meetings, and organize promotion. This is the most effective method for guiding conservation and substitution. Conservation and substitution is a meticulous, complex, and technical work. It is necessary to first make a model, conduct experiments, and gradually promote it from point to point to avoid detours and reduce unnecessary losses. The last leadership experience is to organize professional competitions and promote each other. This can consolidate and expand the results of conservation and substitution. According to the experience of Wuxi, organizing boiler workers and sales personnel to participate in competitions and mobilizing their enthusiasm is an important aspect of doing a good job in conserving and substituting coal.

    In short, "There is much to be done in saving coal." If all regions can learn from Wuxi City's experience of mobilizing the whole people to save coal, a large amount of rich "food" can be added to the industrial front this year.

    从无锡看节约用煤
    狄景襄
    煤是工业的“粮食”。没有动力用煤，绝大多数的机器就不能转动，交通工具不能行驶，冶金工业就要停炉。从最近在无锡市召开的节约煤炭经验交流会上所提供的材料来看，抓住了节约用煤这个环节，也就等于抓住了生产中的关键。
    华东地区，和全国一样，几年来，煤炭的产量飞跃发展。1957年实产一千五百三十二万吨，1958年迅速跃进到三千三百九十六万吨，增产了一倍多。虽然这样迅速地发展生产，但还是赶不上需要。因而大家更加深切地认识到节约煤炭的必要。这不仅是为了把增产的煤炭用之得当，发挥更大的经济效果，也是为了从厉行节约着手，使煤炭的生产和需要部门之间能够更加有计划按比例地得到相对平衡，并对工、农业和人民生活用煤安排得更加合理，使国民经济各部门之间都得到相应的发展。尤其是用煤数量很大的各工业区和各部门，大都不生产煤炭，需要从遥远的矿区调来，因而从这些地区和部门说，节约煤炭就有着更加重要的意义。无锡市在半年之内，由于积极地采取了各种方法节约了四万三千多吨煤，相当于全市一个月用煤量的70％。这个惊人的成绩，就是最好的说明。
              无锡省煤的三项办法
    无锡市的经验，对我们最大的启发是：节约用煤，有很大的潜力可挖，凡是哪一个部门充分发动群众，积极地开展技术革新，哪一个部门就可以找到很多节约煤炭的办法。这些办法，归纳起来，大约有如下三个主要方面：
    第一是降低煤耗，节约用煤。这一方面，先进落后之间的差距是很大的。如无锡利农砖瓦厂每万块砖煤耗为零点四五吨，而无锡砖瓦厂为零点九三五吨，相差一倍以上。再如上海市仁丰印染厂一千米硫化元布煤耗为九十一点六九公斤，而大公印染厂为二百零四点八九公斤，相差120％；上海钢铁三厂二号转炉炼一吨钢用焦一百九十一点三六公斤，上钢二厂却用三百五十四点六公斤；再以集中用煤较多的土窑炼焦厂的洗煤成焦率说，先进的如无锡各厂在71％—72％之间，山东薛城焦厂更达到72.5％—73.5％的水平，而南京钢厂、浙江半山钢铁厂等，一般都在65％—68％之间，每吨焦的耗煤量相差在8％—13％之间。炼铁的净焦比，无锡小高炉（十三和十五立方米）5月份平均为一点二六八吨，2至5月份平均为一点三零二吨，折成焦原煤为三点一三至三点二一吨，但华东各省市除上海、江苏外，一吨生铁煤耗量一般都在四吨以上，如平均能降到三点五吨，则下半年可节约焦原煤一百万吨左右。再如炊事用煤，无锡妇幼保健院每人平均用煤为三两八钱九，一般食堂还停留在十二两至十四两之间。如果落后的部门都能向先进的看齐，或接近先进的水平，下半年平均节约煤炭8％—10％，全华东即可节约煤炭二百八十万吨以上。
    第二，代用和配用白煤、次煤。为了保证钢铁的质量，洗煤炼焦数量日多，不少地区对洗煤后的下脚煤（包括泥炭）和焦炭碎屑并未很好利用，据不完全统计，现在堆存未用的下脚煤和焦屑有五十万吨上下。如按全华东概略估计，下脚煤按入洗原煤20％计，下半年即可有一百五十万吨以上的资源；焦屑按12％计
  （焦厂和用焦部门合计），下半年也有六十万吨上下，这是一个非常可观的煤源。华东自产和调入白煤约占总资源的六分之一，有些调入省市白煤比重较大，因之，用白煤代替烟煤的经验，是解决目前烟煤不足的一个有效的现实途径。再如泥炭、砻糠等代煤，如资源充裕，同样可以解决很大问题。
    第三，合理回收废热、废汽和综合利用煤炭、这是节约的另一个重要方面。如无锡市缫丝一厂利用煮茧车间煮茧后的废水和复摇车间的废汽，预热送入锅炉的冷水，一般在夏季可以提高水温13°—15℃，冬季提高水温20℃以上（较冷水原有温度），不仅可以节约用煤，也可延长锅炉寿命。炼铁小高炉的煤气，除用于加热热风炉外，约有60％—70％损失了。无锡已初步用这些煤气烧水汀，供炉顶保温和生活等用的蒸汽；并可以焙烧矿石，减少硫分（大约焙烧一次可去硫40％—50％），不仅每月节约煤炭一千吨，并可使高炉吃热料，因而降低焦比。土法炼焦的焦油回收工作，一般看来问题很多，为了提高焦油回收率，无锡已把一片土窑群用煤气总管和支管联接起来，用排送机统一抽煤气，统一冷却回收焦油，较单联式回收率提高0.1％—0.2％。目前全市每月可回收焦油五十吨，还打算争取达到八十吨以上。假如华东土法炼焦全部回收焦油，都能达到无锡市回收的水平，并争取向山东薛城焦厂回收率0.6％的水平看齐，那将是一笔很可观的财富。
                省煤离不开技术革新
    当然，要大量节约用煤，并不是一件轻而易举的事。根据无锡和各省市的经验，对煤炭的节约代用，是和群众性的技术革新分不开的。因为节约、代用既要保证用煤部门对提高产量、质量的要求，又要合乎降低成本，不断提高经济效果的原则，因此，必须虚心学习各地的先进措施，不断总结本地区本部门的先进经验，从现实可能出发，改进现有的技术装备，改进操作技术。如无锡市的洗煤炼焦单位，为了适应提高焦炭质量和产量的要求，从去年7月开始建造简易洗煤机。他们根据本市的实际情况，学习并采用了唐山新生焦厂简易洗煤机的设计能力和偏心轴轮构造，利用山东薛城焦厂木制机身结构简单花钱少的优点，同时为了提高劳动生产率和洗煤效果，仿造了上海吴淞煤气厂洗煤机的前道工序，如震动筛、粗碎机、提升机等设备。用他们自己的话说：“就这样取长补短，因地制宜地制造了现在所用的简易洗煤机”。它的特点是用材省，投资少，效果好。每台时可洗原煤三十吨左右，洗煤灰分在正常情况下，占原煤灰分的50％至60％上下。精煤回收率也较高，贾汪煤精煤回收率可达78.13％，开滦煤可达62.45％，洗选成本每吨为八角五分上下，劳动生产率按全员计（包括运输工）平均每人每天为五吨。此外，在生产管理和洗煤操作方面也作了一系列的改革，成焦率可达72％，灰分以干基计算，一般在14.92％左右，含硫少于1％，转鼓强度估计在二百八十公斤上下。所有这些改革，不仅是大大节约了用煤，而且还有利于提高产量、质量，降低成本。
              加强领导把各行各业都抓起来
    除了冶炼部门外，无锡市还抓住了用煤多的发电、交通、砖瓦、石灰和耐火材料、陶瓷、玻璃等工业部门，全面展开了节约用煤的群众性运动。他们的经验主要是用白煤、下脚煤、草炭（也叫泥炭）以及次质煤全部或部分代替烟煤。生活用的锅炉可以全部烧白煤或杂煤（次质煤混配）；一般工业用的锅炉也可全部或搭配部分白煤和杂煤；白煤还可用来焙烧锻件、烧石灰和砖瓦等。无锡利农砖瓦厂的竖窑搭用75％白煤烧砖，因为掌握了白煤燃点高、火焰短、需要空气量较大的特点，相应改进了操作，每万块八五砖耗煤量，从全用烟煤时的零点四八吨降为零点四五吨，且窑底很少有二煤；黑砖只占1.25％。不仅在一般工业中可以使用次质煤，即使在现代化的南昌电厂，烧低质煤也成功了。这个厂今年掺用85％的萍乡低质煤，成本和煤耗都比去年低。
    节约用煤既然是一项全面的群众性的运动，因此就必须要有坚强的组织领导，无锡市在这方面也提供了很好的经验。首先是党委重视，各级领导亲自挂帅，市委成立了节约煤炭办公室，具体地领导了这一工作。其次，在市委直接领导下，安排各单位的用煤供应计划，月月做到“品种到户”、
  “数量到户”。市委和各用煤单位对煤炭的供应和耗用情况都能做到心中有数。再次就是培养典型，做出样子，召开现场会议，组织推广，这是指导节约和代用的最有效的方法。节约代用是一项细致复杂而带有技术性的工作，必须先做出样子，通过试验，由点到面地逐步推广，才能避免走弯路，减少不必要的损失。最后一条领导经验就是组织专业竞赛，互相促进。这样可以巩固和扩大节约代用的成果。根据无锡的经验，组织司炉工和供销人员参加竞赛，把他们的积极性调动起来，是做好节约代用煤炭的一个重要方面。
    总之，“节约用煤，大有可为。”如果各地都能学习无锡市全民动员节约用煤的经验，今年就可以给工业战线增添大量的丰富的“食粮”。
