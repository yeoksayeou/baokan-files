    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 5th. According to local newspapers today, incomplete statistics show that from the beginning of 1956 to the present, the South Vietnamese authorities have illegally entered the demilitarized zone a total of 1,794 times. The International Commission for Vietnam has already concluded that the South Vietnamese authorities violated Article 7 of the Geneva Accords in thirty-eight of these incidents. The International Commission for Vietnam has completed investigations into nine hundred and eighty-four incidents but has not yet reached a conclusion. In addition, the International Commission for Vietnam has not yet begun to deal with seven hundred and seventy-two incidents.
    The Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army recently wrote to the International Commission for Vietnam regarding the above-mentioned incidents, requesting the International Commission for Vietnam to further study the incidents on which no conclusions have been reached, and to begin to deal with the incidents that have not yet been dealt with. At the same time, it should take positive measures to stop the South Vietnamese authorities from undermining the regulations of the demilitarized zone.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 5th. According to Hanoi newspapers, the South Vietnamese authorities recently dispatched armed personnel to the southern part of the demilitarized zone to carry out harassment and arrest residents.
    The South Vietnamese authorities recently promulgated a "martial law order" to implement martial law in the southern part of the demilitarized zone, prohibiting residents from traveling during the day and forcing residents to sleep together at night. Ngo Dinh Diem's army, under the guise of searching for so-called "suspects," has massively arrested peaceful residents.
    The South Vietnamese authorities also forced residents to "study" the fascist decree "Ordinance No. 10 of 1959" manufactured by the US-Ngo clique, and forced residents to "report on each other."
    According to reports, on June 25th and 26th, Ngo Dinh Diem's army arrested more than 30 residents in Xuan Long Village in the southern part of the demilitarized zone, and another five people were arrested on July 1st. These arrested residents are imprisoned in the provincial capital of Quang Tri Province and the prison in Trung Luong County, Quang Tri Province.
