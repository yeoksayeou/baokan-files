Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 17th: The girder erection project for the Chongqing Yangtze River Bridge officially began on the 15th.

　　At 6:30 PM that day, the first plate girder smoothly landed on the pier of the overpass bridge crossing the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway on the north bank. Soon, the bridge will connect the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway with the northern section of the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway.

　　In recent days, the temperature in Chongqing has risen to over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and the scorching sun has heated the steel beams. To allow trains to cross the river as soon as possible, workers from the Fourth Bridge Engineering Division of the Railway Ministry's Bridge Engineering Bureau are fighting day and night at the construction site, braving the heat. On the afternoon of the official start of the girder erection, a flatcar transported a steel plate girder from the pre-assembly yard to the bridgehead. Two crane rigging crews climbed onto the scorching plate girder and firmly tied it to the hooks of the large bridge-erecting machine. When the girder erection command issued the official hoisting order, cheers erupted on the construction site. Five winches turned simultaneously, and the entire steel plate girder, weighing more than 90 tons, was lifted up. Then, the locomotive whistled and pushed the large bridge-erecting machine along with the steel plate girder towards the bridgehead, and then slowly lowered it onto the pier.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, July 17th: Anshan Iron and Steel's five large fixed open-hearth furnaces, due to good furnace body maintenance and repair work, overproduced 400 tons of high-quality steel from July 1st to 15th, exceeding the plan.

　　After completing the first half-year production plan four days ahead of schedule, the workers of the five large fixed open-hearth furnaces immediately strengthened the current key to production – furnace body maintenance and repair work – based on a comprehensive summary of experience. Entering July, the workers of each open-hearth furnace braved the heat and organized two evaluations per week on furnace body maintenance work, promptly providing praise and criticism. They also frequently organized demonstrations and competitions of operating skills in various furnace body maintenance operations, such as blowing the furnace roof, blowing water jackets, and applying the front wall. On the 15th, workers from the Bing shift of the 20th open-hearth furnace performed a fast furnace roof blowing operation, which took only eight minutes and was of good quality. The 23rd and 24th sister open-hearth furnaces also launched a competition. The 23rd furnace had always lagged behind the 24th furnace, but recently, due to the measures taken by the workers of the 23rd furnace to strengthen furnace body maintenance, in the first half of July, not only did the steel output exceed the plan by a large amount, but the average smelting time per furnace of steel was also 54 minutes faster than that of the 24th furnace.

　　Currently, the workers of each open-hearth furnace are continuing to strengthen maintenance and repair work, and the leadership is also strengthening heatstroke prevention, cooling, and safety and health work in various ways to ensure the overfulfillment of the steel production plan for July and the third quarter, and to welcome the tenth anniversary of National Day.

    重庆长江大桥开始架梁
    鞍钢五座平炉加强炉体维护又传增产捷报
    新华社重庆17日电　重庆长江大桥架梁工程15日正式开始。
    这天下午六点三十分钟，第一孔板梁平稳地落到了北岸跨越成渝铁路的跨线桥的墩位上。再过一些时候，大桥就可以把成渝铁路同川黔铁路北段连接起来。
    最近几天，重庆的气温上升到了华氏一百度以上，火一般的太阳烤得钢梁都发热了。为了让火车早日过江，铁道部大桥工程局第四桥梁工程处的工人们，冒着炎热，日夜在工地上奋战着。架梁工程正式开始的这天下午，大平车载运着一孔钢板梁，由预拼场来到桥头。两个装吊工班的工人们登上灼热的板梁，把它牢牢地捆扎在大型架桥机的吊钩上。当架梁指挥部发出正式起吊的命令之后，工地上顿时一片欢呼声，五部绞车同时转动起来，重达九十多吨的钢板梁整孔地被架了起来，接着，机车鸣叫着，把大型架桥机连同钢板梁一同推向桥头，然后徐徐下放到墩位上。
    新华社鞍山17日电　鞍钢五座大型固定式平炉，由于炉体维护检修工作做得好，7月1日到15日超过计划多产了四百吨优质钢。
    五座大型固定式平炉上的职工们在提前四天完成了上半年的生产计划之后，立即在全面总结经验的基础上，加强了当前的生产关键——炉体维护检修工作。进入7月，各平炉职工冒着炎热，每周组织两次关于平炉炉体维护工作的评比，及时进行表扬和批评。在吹炉顶、吹水套、贴前墙等各项炉体维护操作方面，还经常组织表演，相互比赛操作本领。15日，二十号平炉丙班工人进行了一次快速吹炉顶的操作表演，只花八分钟而且质量很好。二十三号、二十四号两座姐妹平炉，也展开了竞赛。二十三号炉一向比二十四号炉落后，最近由于二十三号炉职工采取了加强炉体维护的措施，7月上半月，不仅钢产量超过计划较多，而且每炉钢的平均熔炼时间也比二十四号炉快五十四分钟。
    现在，各平炉职工正在继续加强维护检修工作，领导方面也多方加强防暑降温安全卫生工作，保证超额完成7月份和第三季度产钢计划，迎接国庆十周年。（附图片）
