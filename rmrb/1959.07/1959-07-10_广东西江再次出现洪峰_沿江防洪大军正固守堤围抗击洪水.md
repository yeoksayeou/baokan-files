Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 9th: Another flood peak appeared today in the West River of Guangdong Province. The anti-flood forces along the river are tenaciously defending the embankments to fight the flood. In early July, heavy rains continued in the upper reaches of the West River in Guangxi, and the water levels of various tributaries continued to rise. The water level at the Gaoyao station in Guangdong Province, in the lower reaches of the West River, began to rise again on the 5th, after the previous flood receded to the warning level on the 2nd. On the 7th, it rose to 9.25 meters, exceeding the warning level by 0.25 meters. Then, at 7:00 AM today, a flood peak appeared, with a water level of 9.96 meters (1.39 meters lower than the flood peak on June 23rd). The flood peak is currently passing through Sanshui and entering the Pearl River Delta river network area.

After receiving the news that the flood in the upper reaches of the West River in Guangxi had surged again, the Guangdong Provincial Flood Control Headquarters immediately made specific arrangements for flood control work in the areas along the river. Starting from the 6th, all anti-flood forces went to the embankments. The counties in the Pearl River Delta river network area have also strengthened the patrol and inspection of the embankments. The breach in the Nantieding Embankment of Nanhai County, which was washed away by the previous flood, has been closed on the 6th after emergency repairs with the support of the troops.

Currently, all anti-flood forces are tenaciously defending the embankments, patrolling closely, and fighting the flood.

    广东西江再次出现洪峰
    沿江防洪大军正固守堤围抗击洪水
    新华社广州9日电　广东省西江今天再次出现洪峰，沿江防洪大军正在固守堤围抗击洪水。7月初，广西境内西江上游地区连降大雨，各支流的水位继续上涨。西江下游广东境内的高要站水位，在上次洪水于2日降到警戒水位之后，又于5日开始回涨，到7 日涨到九点二五米，超过警戒水位零点二五米，接着，在今日上午七时出现洪峰，水位高达九点九六米（比上月23日的洪峰水位低一点三九米）。目前洪峰正在经过三水，进入珠江三角洲河网地区。
    广东省防汛指挥部在接获广西境内西江上游地区洪水再度暴涨的消息后，立即对沿江地区的防洪工作作了具体部署。从6日起，各路防洪大军即开上堤围。珠江三角洲河网地带的各县也加强了堤围的巡逻和检修工作。被上次洪水冲崩的南海县南铁鼎围在部队的支援下，经过突击抢修，大堤的缺口已在6日合龙。
    目前，各路防洪大军正在固守堤围，严密巡逻，抗击洪水。
