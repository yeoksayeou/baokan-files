Since liberation, with the restoration and development of the national economy, China's metrological work has greatly developed under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government. In the newly built modern enterprises, especially in the large-scale enterprises that the Soviet Union helped us build, the measurement system uniformly adopted the international metric system (i.e., the meter system, referred to as the metric system); in the original enterprises, through technological transformation, the metric system basically replaced the imperial system and other old miscellaneous systems that had been used; in the daily exchanges of the broad masses of peasants and urban people, the market system formulated on the basis of the metric system has been greatly promoted. Great achievements have also been made in metrological management. During the first five-year plan period, metrological institutions were established internally in most regions and in some enterprises in industrial systems, and metrological verification services were widely carried out. This has created good conditions for further unifying China's measurement system and laid the foundation for further developing metrological work. However, the development of metrological work is still uneven between regions and departments, and a unified national metrological work system has not yet been formed, which is detrimental to the development of the socialist economy. With the great leap forward in China's industrial and agricultural production, the rapid development of science and technology, and the huge increase in the volume of domestic and foreign material exchanges, the measurement system must be further unified, and metrological work must be further developed to meet the needs of socialist economic construction. Based on this, we propose the following points:

(1) Further Unify China's Measurement System

    The international metric system is an advanced measurement system, whose main advantages are decimal progression and easy use, and has been adopted by most countries in the world, especially socialist countries. The Soviet Union issued an order in 1918 to adopt the international metric system. After liberation, the international metric system has also been widely adopted in various economic sectors in China. In order to unify China's measurement system and further eliminate the imperial system and other old miscellaneous systems left over from old China, we suggest that the State Council issue an order to announce the international metric system as China's basic measurement system, promote its use throughout the country, and take the following measures:

    First, retain the market system. The market system is formulated on the basis of the metric system and has been used by the Chinese people. However, most areas still use sixteen taels as one catty, which is troublesome to convert. It should be changed to ten taels as one catty. The time and steps of this reform shall be decided by the people's committees of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government. For the sake of preventing calculation errors, traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions can continue to use the original measurement units without reform.

    Second, abolish the imperial system and other old miscellaneous systems used in China. Except for special needs, the imperial system should be changed to the metric system. Other old miscellaneous systems have been eliminated in most areas. Those that are still in use in some remote areas and ethnic minority areas should take into account the customs of the masses in these areas, the characteristics of the ethnic groups, and avoid affecting market transactions. Take prudent steps to reform them. How to reform them shall be decided by the relevant provincial and autonomous region people's committees.

    The nautical mile can continue to be used because it is a widely used unit for calculating sea voyages internationally.

    Third, unify the Chinese names of metric measurement units. The Chinese names of metric measurement units used several schemes before liberation and have not been completely unified after liberation, which is detrimental to China's socialist construction. These names have been used for a long time, and the masses have already made some choices. Now, based on summarizing the experience of the masses, and in line with the scientific nature of the names of measurement units, a "Unified Chinese Name Scheme for Metric Measurement Units" (scheme attached separately) has been drafted. All those adopting the metric system should gradually adopt the Chinese names of measurement units stipulated in this scheme. The Chinese names of measurement units not stipulated in the scheme shall be formulated and promulgated by the Science and Technology Commission of the People's Republic of China for implementation.

    Those who continue to use the market system shall keep the names of the measurement units unchanged.

(2) Establish a National Metrological Network

    In order to ensure the uniformity of China's measurement system, the consistency, accuracy, and correct use of metrological instruments, it is necessary to quickly establish and improve the national measurement benchmarks and various levels of measurement standards, and to establish and improve regional and enterprise metrological institutions as soon as possible, unify the leadership of metrological work, and form a national metrological network, so as to further develop metrological work.

    First, establish and improve national measurement benchmarks and various levels of measurement standards. The national measurement benchmark is the metrological instrument with the highest accuracy in the country. The establishment of national measurement benchmarks and various levels of measurement standards provides a unified standard for verifying whether the country's metrological instruments are consistent and accurate. In the work of establishing national measurement benchmarks, we should, according to the needs of China's socialist construction, give full play to the existing human and material resources, adopt the method of division of labor and cooperation, and establish the national measurement benchmarks for length, weight (mass), volume, mechanics, temperature, electricity, radio and other aspects as soon as possible. In the work of establishing measurement standards at all levels, we should first use the existing technical forces and equipment of the metrological institutions with better conditions in the region (including local and central departments), and supplement them as necessary, so that they become the unified standard for verifying local metrological instruments. The production and supply of measurement standards and other metrological instruments should be planned as a whole and arranged properly.

    Second, establish and improve regional and enterprise metrological institutions. Regional and enterprise metrological institutions are specialized institutions that carry out metrological verification and management work and ensure the consistency, accuracy, and correct use of metrological instruments. The establishment of metrological institutions should be based on the region, and unified and comprehensive arrangements should be made. The metrological institutions at the provincial, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government levels should be established and improved as soon as possible; the establishment of metrological institutions at all levels below the provincial, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government and the metrological institutions of enterprises shall be decided by the people's committees of the province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government as needed.

    All enterprise units with the conditions should establish metrological institutions or equip metrological management personnel as needed to carry out metrological work. Units that have established metrological institutions and have a certain work foundation, in addition to strengthening their own business, should, under the overall arrangement of various regions, help industrial and mining enterprises and other grassroots units that have not yet carried out metrological work through collaboration to carry out metrological work as soon as possible.

    Third, unify the leadership of metrological work. The unified leadership of metrological work is an important guarantee for establishing a national metrological network and fully developing metrological work. After determining the management principle based on the region, the leadership relationship of metrological work should also be changed in order to achieve unity. At present, the metrological work of some enterprises is still led by various departments, and local metrological institutions are also located in industrial or commercial administrative departments. Therefore, we suggest that metrological institutions at all levels be uniformly led by the science and technology committees at the same level. In places where science and technology committees have not been established, the corresponding departments designated by the people's committees at each level shall lead. The metrological institutions in all enterprise units are also subject to the leadership of local metrological institutions in their business. At the same time, in order to enable metrological business to proceed smoothly, various departments must also strengthen the supervision of the metrological work of their subordinate enterprises.

    The regulations and systems related to measurement that have been issued by various departments and regions on their own, some of which conflict with each other and some of which are no longer suitable, should be re-formulated or supplemented and revised based on summarizing the experience of the masses in accordance with the requirements of fully developing metrological work.

(3) Metrological Work Should Closely Serve Production

    Metrological work must closely serve production, not only serving agricultural production, market transactions, transportation, medical and health care, and scientific and technological research, but especially serving industrial production. In the industrial production process, the improvement of production efficiency and product quality, the division of labor and collaboration of specialized fields are inseparable from unified and accurate measurement. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, the development of industry has put forward higher and more urgent requirements for metrological work. In order to meet this requirement, a policy of comprehensive arrangements with industry as the focus has been adopted in metrological work, and the focus of the work of local metrological institutions has begun to shift to serving industrial production, especially serving steel and machinery production. This is very necessary and correct. Only by resolutely implementing this policy can metrological work more effectively promote the development of the national economy.

    In carrying out metrological work, it is also necessary to implement the policy of combining popularization with improvement. Metrological work is a highly technical work. To do this work well, it requires rich scientific knowledge, a certain number of precision instruments and equipment, and continuous scientific research to improve the level of metrological technology in order to meet the requirements of production and scientific and technological development. At present, China's metrological equipment is still very lacking, and the technical force is also relatively weak. It is very necessary to actively enrich various precision instruments and equipment, equip a certain number of technical cadres, and strengthen metrological research. However, it should also be seen that any measurement is carried out by the broad masses of the people using various metrological instruments in the production process, and metrological technology must also be developed and improved on the basis of summarizing the experience of the masses. Therefore, metrological work must also fully mobilize the broad masses of the people, make full use of existing material and technical conditions, and adopt the method of combining crude with refined and combining indigenous methods with foreign methods to solve the universally existing problems of the use and verification management of metrological instruments, which is an urgent task of the current metrological work. Therefore, metrological work must both improve and popularize. Neglecting either aspect is not conducive to the comprehensive development of this work.

    Under the shining of the Party's general line, China's industrial and agricultural production is continuing to leap forward, and a nationwide campaign to increase production and practice economy centered on technological innovation and technological revolution is also deepening day by day. All departments of the national economy, especially industrial enterprises, have put forward more and higher requirements for metrological work, which has created favorable conditions for further developing metrological work. As long as we rely on the masses under the leadership of the Party and implement the policy of comprehensive arrangements with industry as the focus, combining popularization with improvement, we can rapidly and powerfully develop metrological work and better serve the continued leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

    统一我国计量制度　进一步开展计量工作
    科学技术委员会向国务院提出的报告
    解放以来，随着国民经济的恢复和发展，我国的计量工作在党和人民政府的领导下，有了很大的开展。在新建的现代化企业中，特别是苏联帮助我们建立的大型企业中，计量制度一律采用了国际公制（即米突制，简称公制）；在原有企业中，经过技术改造，基本上以国际公制代替了沿用的英制和其他旧杂制；在广大农村和城市人民的日常交换中，以国际公制为基础制定的市制，得到了很大的推广。在计量管理工作方面也取得了很大的成绩，第一个五年计划期间，多数地区和工业系统中若干企业内部设置了计量机构，广泛地开展了计量检定业务。这样就为我国计量制度的进一步统一创造了良好的条件，为进一步开展计量工作打下了基础。但是，计量工作的开展，在地区之间和部门之间还不平衡，一个统一领导的全国计量工作系统还没有形成，这对于社会主义经济的发展是不利的。随着我国工农业生产的大跃进、科学技术的迅速发展和国内外物资交换量的巨大增长，计量制度必须进一步统一，计量工作必须进一步开展，这样才能适应社会主义经济建设发展的需要。据此，我们提出以下几点意见：
  （一）进一步统一我国的计
          量制度
    国际公制是一种先进的计量制度，其主要优点是十进十退，使用简便，已为世界上多数国家特别是社会主义国家所采用。苏联在1918年就颁布命令，采用了国际公制。我国解放后，国际公制在各经济部门也被广泛采用。为了统一我国的计量制度，进一步淘汰旧中国所遗留下来的英制和其他旧杂制，我们建议国务院明令公布国际公制为我国的基本计量制度，在全国范围内推广使用，并且采取以下措施：
    第一，保留市制。市制是以公制为基础制定的，我国人民已经习惯使用，可以保留。但是，大部分地区沿用十六两为一斤，折算麻烦，应当一律改成十两为一斤；这一改革的时间和步骤由各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会自行决定。中医处方用药，为了防止计算差错，可以继续使用原有的计量单位，不予改革。
    第二，废除在我国使用的英制和其他旧杂制。英制除了因为特殊需要可以继续使用外，应当一律改用公制。其他旧杂制，在广大地区已经被淘汰，有些偏僻地区和少数民族地区还在继续使用的，应当照顾这些地区的群众习惯、民族特点和避免影响市场的交易，采取稳妥步骤予以改革，如何改革，由有关省、自治区人民委员会自行决定。
    海里（浬）因为是国际间广泛通用的计算海程单位，可以继续使用。
    第三，统一公制计量单位的中文名称。公制计量单位的中文名称，在解放前就使用几种方案，解放后也没有完全统一，这对我国的社会主义建设事业是不利的。这些名称，经过长期使用，群众已经有所选择，现在在总结群众使用经验的基础上，本着计量单位名称应有的科学性，拟定了一个“统一公制计量单位中文名称方案”（方案另附）。凡是采用公制的，都应当逐步采用这一方案所规定的计量单位中文名称。方案中未规定的计量单位中文名称，由中华人民共和国科学技术委员会制定公布施行。
    继续沿用市制的，计量单位名称不变。
      （二）建立全国计量网
    为了保证我国计量制度的统一、计量器具的一致、准确和正确使用，应当迅速建立和健全国家的各种计量基准器和各级计量标准器，并且尽快地建立和健全地区的和企业的计量机构，统一计量工作的领导，构成全国的计量网，使计量工作进一步开展起来。
    第一，建立和健全国家计量基准器和各级计量标准器。国家计量基准器是全国准确度最高的计量器具。建立了国家计量基准器和各级计量标准器，对于检定全国计量器具的是否一致和准确，才有了统一的标准。在建立国家计量基准器的工作中，应当根据我国社会主义建设的需要，充分地发挥现有的人力物力，采取分工合作的办法，尽快地把长度、重量（质量）、容量、力学、温度、电学、无线电等方面的国家计量基准器建立起来。在建立各级计量标准器的工作中，应当首先利用本地区条件较好的计量机构（包括地方的和属于中央部门的）的现有技术力量和设备，加以必要的充实，使其成为检定当地计量器具的统一标准。计量标准器和其他各种计量器具的生产和供应，应当统筹规划，妥善安排。
    第二，建立和健全地区的和企业的计量机构。地区的和企业的计量机构，是进行计量检定管理工作，保证计量器具一致、准确和正确使用的专门机构。计量机构的建立，应当以地区为主，作统一和全面的安排。省、自治区、直辖市一级的计量机构应当尽快建立和健全起来；省、自治区、直辖市以下各级计量机构和企业的计量机构的建立，由省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会根据需要决定。
    一切有条件的企业单位，应当根据需要建立计量机构或者配备计量专管人员，开展计量工作。已经建立计量机构并有一定工作基础的单位，除了加强其本身的业务外，应当在各地区的全面安排下，通过协作，帮助尚未开展计量工作的工矿企业和其他基层单位，尽快地把计量工作开展起来。
    第三，统一计量工作的领导。计量工作的统一领导，是建立全国计量网、全面开展计量工作的重要保证。在确定以地区为主的管理原则后，计量工作的领导关系，也应当有所改变，力求统一。目前，还有一些企业的计量工作是由各部门分别领导的，地方的计量机构也分别设在工业或商业行政部门内，因此，我们建议各级计量机构统归同级科学技术委员会领导。没有成立科学技术委员会的地方，由各该级人民委员会指定相应的部门领导。所有企业单位中的计量机构，在业务上兼受当地计量机构的领导。同时为了使计量业务能够顺利进行，各部门还须加强对所属企业计量工作的监督。
    已往由各部门、各地区自行发布的有关计量方面的规章制度，有的相互抵触，有的已不合时宜，应当根据全面开展计量工作的要求，在总结群众经验的基础上，重新制定或者补充修定。
  （三）计量工作要密切地为
          生产服务
    计量工作必须密切地为生产服务，不仅要为农业生产、市场交易、交通运输、医疗卫生、科学技术研究等服务，特别要为工业生产服务。在工业生产过程中，生产效率和产品质量的提高，专业的分工和协作，都离不开统一和准确的计量。去年大跃进以来，工业的发展对计量工作提出了更高、更迫切的要求。为了适应这个要求，在计量工作上采取了全面安排并以工业为重点的方针，地方计量机构的工作重点已经开始转向为工业生产特别是为钢铁和机械生产服务，这是非常必要的和正确的。唯有坚决贯彻这个方针，才能使计量工作更有效地促进国民经济的发展。
    在开展计量工作中，还必须贯彻普及与提高相结合的方针。计量工作是一项技术性较高的工作，搞好这一工作，需要有丰富的科学知识，需要一定数量的精密仪器设备，需要不断地进行各种科学研究，以提高计量技术水平，才能满足生产和科学技术发展的要求。目前，我国的计量设备还很缺乏，技术力量也相当薄弱。积极充实各种精密仪器设备，配备一定数量的技术干部，加强计量研究工作，是十分必要的。但是，也要看到，任何计量都是通过广大群众在生产过程中利用各种计量器具来进行的，计量技术也必须在总结群众经验的基础上才能发展和提高。所以，计量工作又须充分发动广大群众，尽量利用现有物质技术条件，采取从粗到精、土洋结合的办法，解决普遍存在的计量器具的使用和检定管理问题，是当前计量工作迫切的任务。因此，计量工作既要提高，又要普及，忽视哪一方面，都是不利于这一工作全面开展的。
    在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，我国工农业生产正在继续跃进，一个全民的、以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，也正在日益深入地开展，国民经济的各部门，特别是工业企业部门，都对计量工作提出了更多和更高的要求，这就为进一步开展计量工作创造了有利条件。只要我们在党的领导下，依靠群众，贯彻全面安排并以工业为重点、普及和提高相结合的方针，就能够把计量工作迅速有力地开展起来，更好地为工农业生产的继续跃进服务。
