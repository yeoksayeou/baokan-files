    Manage Crops on Scattered Plots
    Jiang Weicai
    Yangzhong County, Jiangsu Province, while managing crops in large fields well, also manages crops on "ten edges" – that is, crops on the edges of fields, roads, rivers, houses, etc. Their approach is worth promoting in the current agricultural production.

    This year, various places have used vacant land and wasteland slopes to plant grains, oil crops, and other crops, expanding the planting area. Managing the crops on scattered plots well, so that each plot has a good harvest, can greatly increase the income of the commune and its members. The experience of Yangzhong County in planting "ten edges" by utilizing vacant land over the years fully proves this point. This county has attached more importance to managing "ten edges" crops year by year, and the output has been higher year by year, and the harvest has been better year by year. From 1956 to 1958, the average yield per mu of three wheat crops planted by utilizing "ten edges" increased from more than 70 jin to more than 110 jin; this year it has been increased to 200 jin per mu, and the county's 7,000 mu of "ten edges" three wheat crops have yielded a total of 1.4 million jin of wheat.

    Some areas are enthusiastic about planting "ten edges" fields but are not very enthusiastic about management. They believe that planting vacant land is an "extra" income, which can be managed or not; can be managed more or less, anyway, "take what you get". This idea is not in line with the spirit of planting more to harvest more. Since we have tried every means to "not let an inch of land go to waste" and spent a lot of labor costs during sowing, and expanded the planting area; then, we should plant one plot, manage one plot, and manage each plot well, to achieve the goal of planting more and harvesting more. Recently, the Yangzhong County Committee of the Communist Party of China calculated an account. If the county's more than 8,000 mu of "ten edges" oil crops are carefully managed, each mu can yield at least 200 jin of soybeans, and a total of more than 1.6 million jin of soybeans can be harvested. From this, it can be seen that as long as the leadership attaches importance to it and the measures are specific, the crops planted on scattered plots can indeed achieve great results.

    Reasonably arranging labor is an important key to managing all scattered land crops well. When managing large-field crops, Yangzhong County draws a certain number of laborers to form professional groups, manages "ten edges" crops by assigning plots to each person, and establishes a management responsibility system. They manage "ten edges" crops very well. The approach of Yangzhong County is possible for all areas with more people and less land and more labor. As for areas with fewer people and more land and less labor, there may be more difficulties in management. As long as labor and time are appropriately arranged, and the management of crops on scattered land is strengthened through the establishment of a responsibility system, it can still be managed well. We suggest that all regions strengthen the management of scattered plots and do everything possible to obtain more grains, oil crops, and other agricultural products from scattered plots.

    管好零星地上的作物
    姜韦才
    江苏扬中县在管好大田作物的同时，又管好“十边”——即田边、路边、河边、屋边等零星地上的作物。他们这种作法，值得在当前农业生产中推广。
    今年，各地都利用空地和荒滩荒坡种植了粮食、油料等作物，扩大了种植面积。把零星土地上的作物管好，使它块块丰收，就能增加公社和社员很大的一笔收入。扬中县几年来利用空闲地、种植“十边”的经验，就充分证明了这一点。这个县由于一年比一年重视管好“十边”作物，产量一年比一年高，收成一年比一年好。1956年至1958年利用“十边”种植的三麦，平均亩产量由七十多斤提高到一百一十多斤；今年更提高亩产二百斤，全县七千亩“十边”三麦，总共收麦子一百四十万斤。
    有些地区在种植“十边”田时轰轰烈烈，在管理时却不太热心。他们认为种植空闲土地是一项“外快”收入，可以管，也可以不管；可以多管，也可以少管，反正“收多少算多少”。这种想法是不符合多种多收精神的。既然在播种时千方百计地“寸土不让”，花去很多工本，扩大了种植面积；那么，就应当种一块，管一块，块块管好，达到多种多收的目的。最近中共扬中县委算了一笔账，全县种植的八千多亩“十边”油料作物，如果加工管理，每亩至少可收到黄豆二百斤，总共可收黄豆一百六十多万斤。由此可见，只要领导重视，措施具体，零星土地种植的作物，确实大有作为。
    合理安排劳力，是管好一切零星土地作物的重要关键。扬中县在管理大田作物时，抽出一定数量的劳力组成专业组，按人分地段管理“十边”作物，并建立了管理的责任制度，他们把“十边”作物管得很好。扬中县的作法，对于所有人多地少、劳力较多的地区来说，都是可能办到的。至于人少地多、劳力较少的地区，在管理上的困难可能多些，只要适当安排劳力和时间，并通过建立责任制来加强零星土地的作物的管理，还是可以管好的。我们建议各地加强零星地的管理，尽一切可能从零星土地上获得更多的粮食、油料和其他农产品。
