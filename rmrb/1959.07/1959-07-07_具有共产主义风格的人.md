　　Editor's Note: The touching story of Soviet textile worker Gaganova, who, regardless of remuneration, voluntarily transferred from an advanced work team to a backward work team to help improve the work, has spread throughout the Soviet Union, inspiring the political enthusiasm and labor activism of Soviet communist builders. At the recent plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee, Comrade Khrushchev praised Gaganova's noble communist behavior. We are now introducing Gaganova's deeds to our readers.

　　The young spinning team led by Valya Gaganova (formerly translated as Gaganova) has long been an advanced work team at the Vishny Volochok Cotton Textile Joint Factory in the Kalinin Oblast of the Soviet Union. This team overfulfills its production quota every month and can guarantee the superior quality of its products.

　　However, why do several other work teams often lag behind them?

　　This question increasingly troubled Gaganova. At the end of last year, when the entire Soviet people were preparing to welcome the 21st Congress of the CPSU, she thought about this issue particularly deeply.

　　Gaganova carefully observed the backward work team led by her friend Shibarova. She originally wanted to talk to her and offer some suggestions, but this aroused Shibarova's dissatisfaction, who said:

　　"It's easy to talk. Fine, you stand in my place and try, and see if you can handle it?"

　　It was at this moment that Gaganova made up her mind. She went to the factory's Communist Youth League committee office and said:

　　"I want to lead a backward work team. Not temporarily, but permanently. I want to transform the backward work team."

　　The secretary of the Youth League committee, Maksimova, said:

　　"Valya, your idea is very good. Doing so will certainly improve the backward sections... but there is a problem, have you considered that doing so will reduce your salary somewhat... How much do you make a month now?"

　　"No less than eight hundred rubles."

　　"But Shibarova has never received even six hundred rubles. It must be made clear to you that you will not be compensated for this difference in the future..."

　　"The problem is not the salary," Gaganova said.

　　She did not consider the salary issue at all, nor was she afraid of the various difficulties she might encounter in a backward work team. What she considered was the heavy responsibility on her shoulders. One thought motivated her: she must improve her friend's team. If all backward sections could be raised to the level of advanced sections, how many more pieces of cotton yarn could be produced for the motherland and the people!

　　Gaganova's request was approved. Indeed, she had been worried about one thing—would her original work team fall behind after she left? She analyzed all the factors, was relieved, and happily bid farewell to her friends. She recommended Smirnova to take her place.

　　Gaganova knew the team members well, and she believed that Smirnova could handle the job. She told the new captain many things she should know and provided her with many valuable suggestions. After taking on her new job, she often came back to visit her original work team, helping her friends and giving them ideas.

　　In the new work team, Gaganova immediately discovered a lot of shortcomings: much production time was wasted in vain; the team members did not display a spirit of mutual assistance and love in their work; when the spinners were too busy, the doffers did not help them; the maintenance of the machines was done very poorly, and accidents often occurred, affecting production.

　　Gaganova found the technician and firmly demanded that the machines be thoroughly repaired. In the new team, this is how she identified all the reasons for backwardness, and then mobilized everyone to resolutely overcome them. Under Gaganova's promotion, the team members' work quickly improved. The girls loved her and listened to her guidance. They saw with their own eyes that since Gaganova came, everything in the team had changed greatly. Everyone worked harder than before. For example, textile worker Semyonova used to only be able to fulfill the production quota, but when Gaganova came, she began to fulfill 113% to 115% of the production quota. Ivanova used to only be able to fulfill 100.8% of the production quota, but later she could also fulfill 115% to 117%. The other team members were the same. Because of the good work, everyone's wages generally increased. The entire team produced 6% more yarn per hour per thousand spindles than planned.

　　However, Gaganova was not satisfied with these achievements. She thought:

　　"It is not very meaningful to improve the work in just one section."

　　Therefore, she began to calculate, if all the work could reach the production quota of the advanced work team, how many tens of tons of cotton yarn would the entire factory produce more, and how many bolts of cloth could be woven with these cotton yarns!

　　Gaganova found the secretary of the factory's Party committee and talked about her ideas, which immediately received the support of the leadership. Soon after, Gaganova put forward her suggestions at the Party member congress and the factory's standing production meeting. She called on all textile workers of the joint factory to support this proposal. As a result, Yartseva, a nationally renowned production innovator and initiator of the movement to collectively impart advanced production experience in the factory, and advanced foremen Dementieva, Nesterova, and Andreeva, etc., all transferred to work in backward work teams. Those formerly backward work teams completed 115% to 120% of their production tasks in the first month. Now, there are forty people in the joint factory who have responded to Gaganova's proposal.

　　However, the most moving thing is not only that advanced workers are transferred to work in backward sections, but that dozens of originally backward work teams have also begun to do a great job without outside help.

　　The members of these work teams talked like this:

　　"Why should we let others come from the side to 'pull' us? We have to do a good job ourselves!" So everyone re-examined their work, looked for the reasons for backwardness, and observed other people's work more carefully in order to catch up with the advanced work teams.

　　Gaganova's communist behavior has spread all over the Soviet Union. Now, not only in textile enterprises, but also in remote forest logging sites, metallurgical enterprises, and collective farms and state farms in the Soviet Union, many workers like Gaganova have emerged.

　　Gaganova often receives enthusiastic letters from all over the motherland praising her. She replied to these letters with excitement, and in her reply to a letter from loggers, she wrote:

　　"Now, each of us should ask ourselves a question: What have you done today for the victory of communism, and what are you prepared to do tomorrow? I have also asked myself such a question. My answer is: I should abandon personal interests and transfer from an advanced work team to a backward work team, and strive to turn the backward work team into an advanced one in a short period of time...

　　"I ask, which Soviet person is unwilling to give up personal interests in order to improve the welfare of all the people?"

　　Not long ago, comrades awarded Gaganova the glorious title of "Communist Labor Shock Worker."

　　Gaganova was invited to participate in the recent plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee because of her advanced deeds, and she spoke at the conference. She said:

　　"The work team I transferred to used to only complete 101% to 105% of the plan, but now it can complete at least 118%. Now all the team members can earn five or six rubles more per day than before, and my income has also reached the level before I came to this team... In May, only one of the 168 work teams in our factory completed less than 110% of the plan, while last year there were more than 20 such work teams.

　　"Our experience proves that there are no bad machines, bad work teams, or bad sections. The only bad thing is that the people there don't work well, their technical level is low, and the labor is not organized well. I believe that our workers understand that as long as they want to do it themselves, and as long as stronger comrades help them well in time, the backward can become advanced.

　　"Our work team has already launched a competition with the work team I used to be in. Other teams have also challenged each other. Now our big collective has agreed that anyone who completes less than 115% of the quota is considered backward. This is our new standard."

　　Gaganova's speech at the plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee won warm applause from the comrades attending the meeting. Comrade Khrushchev also praised her noble behavior in his speech at the plenary session. He said:

　　"The precious and noble thing about this person's behavior is that it is not material interests that drive her to do this, but the idea, the idea of being loyal to the communist system, that drives her to do this, and for this system, this person has made personal sacrifices!" (Attached picture)

    具有共产主义风格的人
    编者按：苏联纺织女工加干诺娃不计报酬，自愿地从先进的工作队转到落后的工作队去帮助搞好工作的动人事迹，传遍了苏联全国，鼓舞了苏联共产主义建设者的政治热情和劳动积极性。在前些天召开的苏共中央全会上，加干诺娃的崇高的共产主义行为受到了赫鲁晓夫同志的赞扬。现在我们在这里把加干诺娃的事迹介绍给读者。
    瓦利亚·加干诺娃（前译加加诺娃）领导的青年纺纱女工队，很久以前就是苏联加里宁州维施涅沃洛茨基棉纺联合工厂的先进工作队。这个队每个月都超额完成生产定额，并能保证产品的优等质量。
    可是，别的几个工作队却常常落在她们后面，这是什么原因呢？
    这个问题愈来愈使加干诺娃不安。去年年底，当全体苏联人民准备迎接苏共第二十一次代表大会的时候，她特别深刻地思考了这个问题。
    加干诺娃细心观察了她的女友希巴洛娃领导的落后的工作队。她本来想同她谈谈，提些意见，但却引起了希巴洛娃的不满，说：
    “讲讲倒很容易。好，你站到我的位置上试试，看你是否吃得开？”
    就在这个时候，加干诺娃下了决心。她来到工厂团委办公室，说：
    “我想去领导一个落后的工作队。不是临时的，而是永久的，我要把落后的工作队转变过来。”
    团委书记马克西莫娃说：
      “瓦利亚，你的想法很好。这样做，当然可以提高落后的工段……不过有个问题，你考虑过没有，这样做你会减少一些工资……现在你一个月拿多少钱？”
    “不少于八百卢布。”
    “可是希巴洛娃连六百卢布也没有领过。必须向你说明白，将来不会给你补发这笔钱……”
    “问题不在工资。”加干诺娃说。
    她根本没有考虑工资问题，也不惧怕在落后的工作队可能遇到的各种困难，她考虑的是自己肩负的重大责任。有一个思想在激励她：必须把女友的队搞好。如果把所有落后的工段都提高到先进工段的水平，那么，将能给祖国和人民多生产多少件棉纱啊！
    加干诺娃的请求得到了批准。不错，她曾为一个问题感到不安——她走后，自己原来所在的工作队会不会落后呢？她分析了一切因素，放了心，高兴地向女友们告别。她推荐斯米尔诺娃接替自己的职务。
    加干诺娃对队员的情况了如指掌，她相信斯米尔诺娃能够胜任这项工作。她把许多应该知道的事情告诉新队长，向她提供了许多宝贵的意见。她走上新的工作岗位以后，还经常回来探望自己原来的工作队，帮助女友们，给她们出主意。
    在新的工作队里，加干诺娃立刻发现一大堆缺点：许多生产时间白白地浪费了；队员在劳动中没有发挥互助友爱的精神，纺纱工忙不过来的时候，落纱工也不去帮助她们；机器的维护工作做得极差，经常出事故，使生产受到影响。
    加干诺娃找到技师，坚决要求把机器彻底修好。在新的队里，她就是这样找出一切落后的原因，然后动员大家去坚决克服。在加干诺娃的推动下，队员们的劳动很快就有了起色。姑娘们都爱她，听从她的指导。她们亲眼看到，自从加干诺娃来了以后，队里的一切工作都起了很大的变化。人人都比过去劳动得更好了。例如，纺织女工谢苗诺娃过去仅能完成生产定额，可是当加干诺娃来了以后，她开始完成生产定额的113％到115％。伊万诺娃过去只能完成生产定额的100.8％，后来也能完成115％到117％。别的队员也是这样。由于工作的好，大家的工资普遍提高了。全队每小时用一千纱锭生产的纱比计划多6％。
    但是，加干诺娃并不满足这些成绩。她想：
      “只是一个工段改进工作，意义不大。”
    因此，她开始计算，如果所有的工作都能达到先进工作队的生产定额，全厂将要多生产几十吨棉纱，用这些棉纱能织成多少匹布啊！
    加干诺娃找到工厂党委书记，谈了自己的想法，立刻得到领导方面的支持。不久以后，加干诺娃在党员大会上和工厂常设生产会议上提出自己的建议。她号召联合工厂的全体纺织工人都支持这个建议。于是厂里全苏闻名的生产革新者、集体传授先进生产经验运动的发起人雅尔采娃，先进工长杰缅捷娃、涅斯捷罗娃和安得烈耶娃等，纷纷转到落后工作队去工作。那些从前落后的工作队，在第一个月就完成生产任务的115％到120％。现在，联合工厂里已有四十个响应加干诺娃建议的人。
    但是，最动人的事并不仅仅在于先进工人转到落后工段上去工作，而几十个原来落后的工作队，在没有外力帮助的情况下，也开始干得很出色了。
    这些工作队的队员们这样谈论：
    “为什么要让别人从旁边来‘拉’我们一把呢？我们自己要把工作搞好！”于是大家纷纷重新检查工作，找落后的原因，更细心地观察别人的劳动情况，以便赶上先进的工作队。
    加干诺娃的共产主义行为传遍了全苏各地。现在，不仅在纺织企业里，而且在苏联边远的森林采伐场、冶金企业以及集体农庄和国营农场里，也出现了许多像加干诺娃这样的工作者。
    加干诺娃经常收到来自祖国各地的热情洋溢的赞扬她的信。她怀着激动的心情答复这些信，在她给伐木工人的一封回信里写道：
    “现在，我们每一个人都应该给自己提出一个问题：为了共产主义的胜利，你今天做了些什么，明天还准备做些什么？我给自己也提出了这样的问题。我的回答是：我应该抛弃个人利益，从先进的工作队转到落后的工作队去，并且争取短期内把落后的工作队转为先进的……
    “请问，哪一个苏联人为了提高全体人民的福利，而不愿意放弃个人利益呢？”
    不久以前，同志们把“共产主义劳动突击手”的光荣称号授给了加干诺娃。
    加干诺娃由于她的先进事迹而应邀参加了前些天召开的苏共中央全会，并且在大会上发了言。她说：
    “我所转到的这个工作队，过去只能完成计划101％至105％，现在至少可以完成118％。现在全体队员每天都可以比过去多收入五、六个卢布，而我的收入也达到了没来这个队以前的水平……5月份，我们工厂的一百六十八个工作队，只有一个完成计划的110％以下，而去年却有二十多个这样的工作队。
    “我们的经验证明，没有不好的机器，不好的工作队和工段。不好的只是那里的人工作得不好，技术水平低，劳动组织得不好。我以为，我们的工人明白，只要他们自己想去作，只要有比较强的同志及时地好好帮助他们，落后的就能够变成先进的。
      “我们的工作队已经同我过去所在的那个工作队展开了竞赛。其他的队也相互挑战了。现在我们这个大集体已说定，谁要是完成定额在115％之下，就算是落后的。这是我们的新标准。”
    加干诺娃在苏共中央全会上的讲话博得了参加会议的同志们的热烈掌声。赫鲁晓夫同志在全会的发言中，也赞扬了她的崇高行为。他说：
    “这个人的行为的可贵和高尚之处在于，不是物质利益推动她去这样做，而是思想、对共产主义制度忠心耿耿的思想推动她去这样做，为了这一制度，这个人作出了个人的牺牲！”（附图片）
