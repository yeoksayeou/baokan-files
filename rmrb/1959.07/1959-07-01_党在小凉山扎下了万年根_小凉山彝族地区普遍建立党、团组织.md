Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 30th – Party and Communist Youth League grassroots organizations have been universally established in the Xiaoliangshan area of Yunnan Province. The broad masses of the Yi people are cheering, "The Party has planted a ten-thousand-year root in Xiaoliangshan."

	Xiaoliangshan is located on the Yunnan-Sichuan border plateau in northwestern Yunnan, where more than 60,000 Yi people live. This area had long maintained a slave system, and slaves suffered extremely cruel oppression. In 1956, at the urgent request of the broad masses of slaves and poor people, and with the consent of upper-class figures of the Yi nationality, the Xiaoliangshan area implemented democratic reforms through peaceful consultation, abolishing the slave system. The broad masses of poor people were freed from all kinds of oppression and exploitation by slave owners. In the first year after gaining freedom, the slaves, who previously owned nothing, were provided with all necessities of life by the government free of charge, from food and farming tools to bowls, chopsticks, and every bit of thread. Last year, the Yi people launched an unprecedented production upsurge and achieved a great bumper harvest of grain. After these practical struggles and the cultivation and education of Party organizations at all levels, more than 300 Yi people have now joined the Communist Party of China, and nearly 400 have joined the Communist Youth League of China. Among the more than 50 production brigades in the 14 people's communes in the Xiaoliangshan area, 49 brigades have established Party branches, and 40 brigades have established Communist Youth League branches.

	In the process of establishing and developing grassroots organizations, Party committees at all levels in the Xiaoliangshan area have adopted various methods of cultivation and education for activists among the masses, based on the local characteristics. Party organizations at all levels have selected activists to visit factories in the interior in batches, increasing their perceptual knowledge of the working class and socialist construction. Through them, combined with their own personal experiences, they have publicized the nature and tasks of the Party to the broad masses. Various localities have organized the masses to study the current policies of the Party through methods such as recollections and comparisons, which has further improved the masses’ understanding of the Party and communism. In some places, local Communist Party members of the Yi nationality have given personal accounts to conduct vivid Party constitution education for the masses. In this way, a mass communist education movement quickly formed in the Xiaoliangshan area, and the awareness of the Yi people has significantly improved. They universally demanded the establishment of Party grassroots organizations, requested that the Communist Party "never leave Xiaoliangshan for generations," and actively recommended excellent activists to the Party, vigorously promoting Party building work in the Xiaoliangshan area.

	Since the establishment of Party grassroots organizations, they have played a significant role in the development of various tasks in the Xiaoliangshan area. The vast majority of Party branches have gradually been able to lead the various tasks of a production brigade. In order to expand the planting area of ​​spring crops, Party branches in various places have organized the masses, led by Party members, to climb back and forth for more than ten days, transporting more than 200,000 catties of seeds from the interior by manpower and pack animals. For the first time, wheat was planted on a large scale in Xiaoliangshan, and as a result, the total output of wheat crops this year increased by more than five times compared to last year.

    党在小凉山扎下了万年根
    小凉山彝族地区普遍建立党、团组织
    据新华社昆明30日电　云南省小凉山地区已经普遍建立起党和团的基层组织，广大彝族人民欢呼：“党在小凉山扎下了万年根。”
    小凉山位于云南与四川交界的滇西北高原上，聚居着六万多彝族人民。这个地区曾长期保持着奴隶制度，奴隶们遭受极其残酷的压迫。1956年，在广大奴隶和穷苦百姓的迫切要求下，经过本民族上层人士的同意，小凉山地区以和平协商方式实行了民主改革，废除了奴隶制度。广大贫苦群众摆脱了奴隶主的种种压迫和剥削。过去一无所有的奴隶们，在获得自由后的第一年，生活必需的口粮、农具直到碗筷和一针一线，都是政府无偿地供给的。去年，彝族人民掀起了前所未有的生产高潮，获得了粮食大丰收。经过这些实际斗争的锻炼和各级党组织的培养教育，目前，彝族人民中已有三百多人加入了中国共产党，近四百人加入了中国共产主义青年团。小凉山地区十四个人民公社的五十多个生产大队中，已经有四十九个大队建立了党的支部，四十个大队建立了团的支部。
    小凉山地区各级党委在建立和发展基层组织的过程中，都根据当地的特点，对群众中的积极分子采取了各种培养教育的方法。各级党组织曾经分批选派积极分子到内地工厂参观访问，增加他们对工人阶级和社会主义建设的感性知识，并且通过他们，结合自己的亲身感受，向广大群众宣传党的性质和任务。各地组织群众用回忆对比等方式，学习当前党的政策，也进一步提高了群众对党和共产主义的认识。有的地方还由本民族共产党员现身说法，对群众进行生动的党章教育。这样，在小凉山地区就很快形成了一个群众性的共产主义教育运动，彝族人民群众的觉悟有了显著提高。他们普遍要求建立党的基层组织，要求共产党“世世代代都不要离开小凉山”，并且积极地向党推荐优秀的积极分子，有力地推动了小凉山地区的建党工作。
    党的基层组织建立以来，对小凉山地区各项工作的发展发挥了显著的作用。绝大多数党支部已经逐渐地能够领导一个生产大队的各项工作。为了扩大小春作物的种植面积，各地党支部曾组织群众，在党员带头下，来回爬过十多天的山路，人背马驮地从内地运了二十多万斤籽种，在小凉山第一次大规模地种上了小麦，因而今年小麦作物的总产量，比去年增加了五倍多。
