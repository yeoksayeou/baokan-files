Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 17th. Huainan Coal Mine's Xieji No. 2 Mine is vigorously tapping the potential of mechanical equipment, making one set of equipment perform the function of two. This has enabled the entire mine, which was originally designed with a production capacity of 900,000 tons of coal per year, to produce more than 900,000 tons of coal in the first half of the year, achieving a year's production in half a year.

Xieji No. 2 Mine is a large-scale mine with a high degree of mechanization, put into production in 1956. It possesses a large amount of coal mining, tunneling, transportation, hoisting, ventilation, and drainage mechanical equipment. In order to fully exploit the potential of existing mechanical equipment, the mine first made many reforms in development design. For example, the original single-wing extraction method required a set of transport machinery to be installed at each mining face. Now, double-wing extraction is implemented, and two mining faces can share a set of transport machinery. The original design length of each mining face was sixty meters, but now it has been increased to one hundred and ten meters, reducing the original three working faces to two, which also saves on transportation equipment for one mining face. The mine has also taken measures to increase the output of existing mining faces and minimize the opening of new mining faces, in order to save mechanical equipment.

Ensuring the normal operation of all mechanical equipment is also an important experience for the mine in improving the utilization rate of mechanical equipment. First, they established a professional mechanization group to strengthen the maintenance and management of equipment. At the same time, they mobilized mining workers to maintain mechanical equipment. A series of mechanical equipment maintenance and repair systems were also established, such as a responsible maintenance system with designated personnel for different sections and departments, a regular maintenance system, and a responsibility system where repair workers "leave their names on tags" on the equipment, ensuring that every machine has someone responsible for it. Due to the strengthening of electromechanical management and equipment maintenance and repair work, the mine's four major equipment systems for hoisting, compressed air, ventilation, and drainage have basically not experienced any major accidents since the beginning of this year, and the number of coal mining and transportation equipment accidents in the mine has also been greatly reduced compared to last year. The wind picks and rock drills used for coal mining and tunneling in the entire mine have not been damaged since the mine went into production. The No. 3 Coal Mining District originally used thirty-five sets of chain conveyors and belt conveyors, but due to the reduction in failures, now only twenty-nine sets are needed.

The mine also changed the original two-shift hoisting to three-shift hoisting, increasing the daily working time of the hoisting equipment from the original fourteen hours to twenty hours. They also appropriately increased the amount of each hoist while ensuring safety, increasing the capacity of the hoisting equipment from 3,000 tons to 6,000 tons per day.

    革新采煤技术　加强机械维修
    谢家集二矿一套设备顶两套
    新华社合肥17日电淮南煤矿谢家集二矿大力挖掘机械设备的潜力，一套设备发挥了两套设备的作用，使全矿井只有年产九十万吨煤设计能力的设备，在上半年就生产了九十多万吨煤，半年生产顶一年。
    谢家集二矿是1956年投入生产的一座机械化程度很高的大型矿井，拥有大量采煤、掘进、运输、提绞、抽风、排水机械设备。为了充分发挥现有机械设备的潜力，这个矿首先在开拓设计方面作了许多改革。比如，原来实行单翼回采，每个采煤工作面需要安装一套运输机械，现在改为双翼回采，两个采煤工作面就可以共用一套运输机械。原来每个采煤工作面的设计长度是六十米，现在加大到一百一十米，把原来三个工作面改为两个工作面，也节省了一个采煤工作面的运输设备。这个矿还采取措施提高现有采煤工作面的产量，尽量少开新的采煤工作面，以节省机械设备。
    保证所有机械设备正常运转，也是这个矿提高机械设备利用率的一项重要经验。首先，他们成立了专业机械化小组，加强了设备的维护管理。同时发动采掘工人来维护机械设备。还建立了一系列的机械设备维护检修制度，如分片分部的专责维护制、定期检修制，检修工人在设备上“挂牌留名”的责任制度等，做到了每部机器都有人负责。由于加强了机电管理和设备维护检修工作，全矿提绞、压风、抽风、排水四大设备，今年以来基本上没有发生过重大事故，矿井下的采煤运输设备事故也比去年大大减少。全矿采煤掘进用的风镐风钻，从矿井投入生产以来一直没有损坏。采煤三区原来使用三十五部链板机和皮带机，由于故障减少，现在只要二十九部就可以了。
    这个矿还将原来两班提绞改为三班提绞，这样提绞设备每天工作的时间由原来的十四小时增加到二十小时。他们并在保证安全的条件下，适当增加了每次的提绞量，使提绞设备的能力由每天三千吨提高至六千吨。
