Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 21st: According to newspaper reports, the Indian cabinet did not make an immediate decision on the Kerala issue at its meeting on the afternoon of the 20th.

The report said that Prime Minister Nehru would report on his recent talks with Kerala Chief Minister Namboodiripad in Simla. Earlier, he met with President Prasad to discuss the Kerala issue.

According to the "Indian Express," although the consensus is that central government intervention may be inevitable due to the Communist Party's refusal to hold new elections, "it is believed that this issue must be handled with caution."

The central government will hold another meeting before the parliament convenes on August 3rd to discuss the situation in Kerala in detail, and then submit the issue to the parliament.

The All-India Congress Committee headquarters here released on the 20th a memorandum submitted by the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee to the Indian President on July 9th. The memorandum requested the President to take measures to promote new elections in Kerala.

According to the Press Trust of India, Namboodiripad said in Trivandrum yesterday that the memorandum contained nothing new and was not worth refuting. Namboodiripad pointed out that many of the "charges" against the Kerala government in previous indictments were omitted in this memorandum. This shows that the Congress Party feels it is difficult to defend these charges.

In the past few days, the agitation activities of the opposition parties in Kerala have continued. Leaders of the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee, such as Shankar, fiercely attacked the resolution of the All-India Committee of the Communist Party of India regarding its disagreement with holding new elections in Kerala, and demanded that the central government intervene. Padmanabhan, leader of the "Kerala Liberation Struggle Committee," and Pillai, leader of the Kerala branch of the Praja Socialist Party, went to Delhi to lobby, demanding that the central government intervene in the situation in Kerala. To coordinate with this action, Praja Socialist Party leader Kripalani held a rally in Delhi on the 19th. While Kripalani demanded that the central government take action as soon as possible, Padmanabhan also demanded that the Congress Party abolish the Communist Party-led Kerala government and ban communists from participating in any future elections in India.

### 印内阁讨论喀拉拉邦问题  邦内反对派继续进行煽动活动

    印内阁讨论喀拉拉邦问题
    邦内反对派继续进行煽动活动
    新华社新德里21日电　据报纸消息，印度内阁在20日下午举行的会议上没有立即对喀拉拉邦问题作出决定。
    消息说，尼赫鲁总理将报告他最近在西姆拉同喀拉拉邦首席部长南布迪里巴德举行的会谈经过。早些时候，他会见了普拉沙德总统，讨论了喀拉拉邦问题。
    据“印度快报”报道，虽然一致的意见是，由于共产党拒绝重新选举，中央政府的干涉可能是不可避免的，但是，“人们认为，必须慎重处理这个问题。”
    中央政府将在国会8月3日开会以前再次举行会议，详细讨论喀拉拉邦的局势，然后把这个问题提交国会。
    国大党全国委员会总部20日在这里发表了国大党喀拉拉邦委员会在7月9日交给印度总统的备忘录。备忘录请求总统采取措施来促使喀拉拉邦重新举行选举。
    据印度报业托辣斯说，南布迪里巴德昨天在特里凡得琅发表谈话说，这份备忘录没有什么新的东西，不值一驳。南布迪里巴德指出，以前的指控状里对喀拉拉邦政府提出的许多“罪状”，这次备忘录中都略而不提了。这表明，国大党感觉到，要为这些指控辩护是有困难的。
    在过去几天中，喀拉拉邦反对党的煽动活动仍在继续中。国大党喀拉拉邦组织的领袖山卡尔等激烈攻击印度共产党全国委员会关于不同意在喀拉拉邦重新举行选举的决议，并且要求中央政府进行干涉。“喀拉拉邦解放斗争委员会”领袖帕德马纳班和人民社会党喀拉拉邦组织的首领皮莱分别到德里活动，要求中央政府干涉喀拉拉邦的局势。为了配合这种行动，人民社会党首领克里帕拉尼19日在德里举行了集会。在克里帕拉尼要求中央政府从速采取行动的同时，帕德马纳班还要求国大党取消印度共产党领导的喀拉拉邦政府，并且不准共产党人参加今后的印度任何选举。
