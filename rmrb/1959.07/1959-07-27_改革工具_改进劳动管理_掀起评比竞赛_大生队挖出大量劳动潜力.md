Reform Tools Improve Labor Management Launch Appraisal Competitions
Dasheng Team Mines Large Amounts of Labor Potential

    According to the Zhejiang Daily, the Dasheng Production Team of the Lizhu People's Commune in Shaoxing, mobilized the masses to improve labor productivity in all aspects, solving the problem of labor shortage during the summer harvest and planting season.

    This year, the production team faced a particularly prominent contradiction of labor shortage due to the expansion of double-cropping rice and the increase of early-maturing varieties. From July 13 to August 3, a period of twenty-two days, each person had to earn an average of 18.2 work points per day to complete the task. The Party branch immediately mobilized commune members to discuss the issue. During the discussion, many cadres and commune members actively advocated carrying out a high work efficiency movement and improving management methods to solve the problem of labor shortage. Some commune members said, "Rice carts and mud-dragging boats are good tools for transportation. Last year, we used three rice carts, operated by two people with one ox, and could haul rice from twenty mu per day, increasing work efficiency by two to three times compared to manual carrying." Many commune members were very interested in large sickles, saying: "This year, the density of early rice transplanting is high, and it is most effective to cut with a large sickle, which can increase work efficiency by at least one and a half times compared to a small sickle." With a unified understanding, the team decided to launch a high work efficiency movement to increase labor efficiency in every possible way.

    Improving tool reform is the central link in improving labor efficiency. The entire team organized its forces and, after a few days of intensive work, repaired all twenty-three rice threshers and eighty rice buckets. All forty wind-powered waterwheels in the team were repaired and could operate, increasing work efficiency by five to six times compared to using foot-operated waterwheels, saving 16,000 labor work points. To ensure that various new tools played a greater role, the team also selected fifteen experienced commune members to serve as farm tool custodians and established a farm tool repair team.

    Rational organization of labor and improvement of labor management are also important links in improving labor efficiency. The team focused on four points:

    First, division of labor and specialization according to each person's strengths. Within the production team, the labor force was organized into groups for rice cutting, threshing, plowing, seedling pulling, fertilizer transportation, fertilization, weeding, and grain drying. The tasks were clear, making it easy to check and accept results, and facilitating the commune members' strengths. At the same time, the labor was divided according to each person's physical strength, skills, and other conditions. Work that women could do was not done by men, work that the elderly could do was not done by the young, and work that children could do was not done by adults.

    Second, implement a small-scale contract responsibility system and mobilize commune members to self-report labor work points. The labor work points self-reported by commune members in all fifteen teams exceeded the production team's planned allocation. Commune members said: "After self-reporting work points, everyone knows what's expected, and everyone shares the burden."

    Third, improve the method of calculating work points and implement quota management to ensure clear work point assessment in the fields. The method is: tasks assigned to the fields, responsibilities assigned to individuals, work points assigned to each plot, collective work assessed clearly in the fields, individual work assessed according to the work done, with a small summary every five days, a medium summary every half month, and a final settlement after the summer harvest and planting season.

    Fourth, appropriately arrange farm work for sunny and rainy days, day and night, morning and afternoon.

    To alleviate the labor shortage during the summer harvest and planting season, the team also made proper arrangements for various farm tasks, completing tasks that could be done in advance. The entire team has weeded all the barnyard grass, weeds, and field embankment grass from 421 mu of seedling fields, which can increase fertilizer and facilitate pulling night seedlings. Based on last year's experience, they also decided to cut down the early japonica rice that is not easy to thresh and pile it on the spot, threshing it after the summer harvest and planting season is basically over, which can also alleviate the labor shortage.

    The production team also adopted methods such as recognizing advanced individuals, setting up pacesetters, and carrying out competitions to promote the high work efficiency movement. Recently, they established advanced pacesetters through appraisal and called on all commune members to learn from the advanced. They also used methods such as advanced report groups, on-site skill competitions, training new workers by old hands on the spot, and wall publicity to promote the advanced and spread their experience.

    After taking these series of measures, the Dasheng Team mined more than 118,000 labor work points. In addition to making up for the original shortage of more than 90,000 work points, there was also a surplus, allowing the twenty-two-day summer harvest and planting tasks to be completed three days ahead of schedule.

    In recent days, commune members have been actively preparing for the summer harvest and planting. Attendance has consistently been above 95%.

    改革工具  改进劳动管理  掀起评比竞赛
    大生队挖出大量劳动潜力
    据浙江日报消息  绍兴漓渚公社大生生产队，发动群众，从各方面提高劳动生产效率，解决了夏收夏种劳力不足的问题。
    今年，这个生产队由于扩大了连作稻，增加了早熟品种，劳力不足的矛盾显得非常突出。从7月13日至8月3日的二十二天内，平均每人每天要做十八点二个工分才能完成任务。党支部当即发动社员讨论，在讨论中，不少干部和社员积极主张开展高工效运动和改进管理办法，来解决劳力不足的问题。有的社员说：“稻拖架和拖泥船，是运输工具中的好东西，去年用了三部稻拖架，由二个人带一头牛操作，一天可以拖稻二十亩，工效比由人挑提高二、三倍。很多社员对大镰刀很感兴趣，他们说：今年早稻插秧密度高，用大镰刀割最有劲，比小镰刀起码要提高工效一倍半。大家的思想认识统一了，决定全队大搞高工效运动，千方百计提高劳动效率。
    搞好工具改革是提高劳动效率的中心环节。全队组织力量，经过几天突击，把二十三部打稻机、八十只稻桶全部修好。全队四十部风力水车，经过修理，部部都能运转了，比用脚踏水车提高工效五、六倍，可以节约一万六千个劳动工分。为了使各种新式工具发挥更大作用，队里还选出了十五个有经验的社员担任农具保管员，成立了农具专修组。
    合理组织劳动力，改进劳动管理，也是提高劳动效率的重要环节。这个队着重抓住四条：
    第一，按每人特长分工分业。在生产小队内将劳动力编成割稻、打稻、翻耕、拔秧、运肥、施肥、耘田、晒谷等小组，任务明确，便于检查验收，有利于发挥社员的特长；同时还根据每个人的体力、技能等情况进行分工、妇女会做的活男的不做，老年会做的青年不做，少年会做的大人不做。
    第二，实行小段包工责任制，发动社员自报劳动工数。全队十五个小队，社员自报的劳动工分，都超过生产队的计划投放数。社员们说：自报工分后，人人心中有数，担子大家挑。
    第三，改进计工评分方法，实行定额管理，做到评分田头清。方法是：任务到田，责任到人，工分到丘，集体干活田头清，个人干活按活清，做到五天一小结，半月一中结，夏收夏种结束后再清算。
    第四，适当安排晴天和雨天、白天和晚上、上午和下午的农活。
    为了缓和夏收夏种期间劳力紧张状况，该队还对各项农活作了妥善安排，把可以提前做的农活提前做好。全队已把四百二十一亩秧田的稗草、杂草、田塍草全部拔光，这样可增加肥料，有利于拔夜秧。根据去年经验，他们还决定把不易脱粒的早粳稻割倒后就地堆放，到夏收夏种基本结束后脱粒，这样也可以缓和劳动力紧张的状况。
    这个生产队还采取抓先进、立标兵、开展竞赛等方法，促进高工效运动。最近他们通过评比，树立了先进标兵，号召全体社员向先进学习。并且采用先进报告团、现场比巧、老手带新手就地训练、墙头宣传等办法，宣扬先进推广先进。
    大生队采取这一系列措施后，共挖出十一万八千多个劳动工分，除弥补原来缺少的九万多工分外，还有了多余，使二十二天的夏收夏种任务能提前三天完成。
    近日来，社员们正积极进行夏收夏种的准备工作。出勤始终在95％以上。
