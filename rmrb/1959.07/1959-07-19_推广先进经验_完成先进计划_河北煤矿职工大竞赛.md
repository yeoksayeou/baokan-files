Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 18th: A socialist labor competition for large-scale high yields has been launched by 200,000 coal mine workers in Hebei Province to ensure the comprehensive fulfillment and over-fulfillment of the third quarter production tasks.

Kailuan Coal Mine, one of the mining bureaus that proposed the competition initiative to coal mine workers nationwide, has generally revised its plans and put forward practical and feasible measures to guarantee the completion of the plans in order to realize the conditions proposed in the initiative. The revised plans of 1,882 groups in the Tangjiazhuang, Linxi, Zhaogezhuang, and Tangshan mines increased the average planned output by about 10% compared to the original. In the competition, all mines vigorously promoted advanced experiences, organized regular cyclical operations, and implemented three-shift coal extraction. In the past two days, the night shift output of the entire bureau has reached more than 4,500 tons, an increase of nearly 2,000 tons compared to the past. In order to reduce mechanical and electrical transportation accidents and ensure safe production, all mines have further strengthened production management and established a daily mechanical and electrical dispatch meeting. Leading cadres from the Party, government, labor union, and district heads of Tangshan Mine formed an underground "medical team" to go deep into the site to solve problems with mechanical and electrical transportation equipment, greatly improving equipment efficiency.

All mines have also strengthened the organization and leadership of production preparation work, designated special personnel to be responsible for leading production preparation work, and established a tunneling dispatch office. Currently, the mine's raw coal output and tunneling footage are increasing daily. From July 9th to 13th, the average daily output increased by more than 2,000 tons of coal and more than 180 meters of tunneling compared to the previous eight days.

After full discussion, the workers of Jingxing, Fengfeng, Xinglong, Xiahuayuan, and other coal mines also formulated competition conditions and measures to ensure the completion of the competition conditions. Dozens of cadres and technicians from Jingxing Coal Mine went deep into the mine to work with the workers and direct production on-site, greatly encouraging the workers' production enthusiasm. At present, a competition movement of "three highs" (high yield, high speed, high quality) and "two goods" (good completion of tasks, good implementation of rules and regulations) has rapidly unfolded throughout the mine.

    推广先进经验　完成先进计划
    河北煤矿职工大竞赛
    新华社天津18日电　河北省二十万煤矿职工掀起大面积丰产的社会主义劳动竞赛，保证全面完成和超额完成第三季度生产任务。
    向全国煤矿职工提出竞赛倡议的矿务局之一——开滦煤矿职工，为了实现倡议中提出的条件，普遍修订了计划，并提出了保证完成计划的切实可行的措施。唐家庄、林西、赵各庄、唐山四个矿一千八百八十二个小组，修订后的计划产量平均比原来提高10％左右。各矿在竞赛中，大力推广先进经验，组织正规循环作业和实行三班出煤。近两天来，全局夜班产量已经达到四千五百吨以上，比过去提高将近二千吨。为了减少机电运输事故，保证安全生产，各矿进一步加强了生产管理，建立了每天机电调度会。唐山矿党政工团领导干部和各区区长联合组成井下“医疗队”，深入现场解决机电运输设备的问题，大大提高了设备效率。
    各矿还加强了对生产准备工作的组织领导，确定专人负责领导生产准备工作，成立了掘进调度室。现在，这个矿的原煤产量和掘进进尺数日日上升。7月9日到13日，平均比前八天每天增产二千多吨煤，多掘进一百八十多米。
    井陉、峰峰、兴隆、下花园等煤矿职工经过充分讨论，也制定了竞赛条件和保证完成竞赛条件的措施。井陉煤矿的几十名干部和技术人员，深入矿井与工人一起劳动，在现场指挥生产，大大鼓舞了职工的生产热情。目前，一个三高（高产、高速、高质）、两好（完成任务好、执行规章制度好）的竞赛运动，已在全矿迅速开展起来。
