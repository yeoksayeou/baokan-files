Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 6th: Joseph Kiwanuka, Chairman of the Uganda National Congress, stated at a rally held here on the evening of the 5th to commemorate "Uganda Day" that the people of Uganda are disgusted with the foreign rule in their country and will not rest until they achieve independence.

Kiwanuka said that he had submitted a memorandum to the committee appointed by the Governor of Uganda to study the new constitution of Uganda, expressing this determination of the Ugandan people. He also said, "We have shown the British Governor that Uganda is fully prepared to fight for its independence."

John Kale, Foreign Affairs Secretary of the Uganda National Congress, condemned the declaration of a state of emergency in Uganda during his speech at the meeting, and said that holding "Uganda Day" in various parts of Asia and Africa is a serious warning to British imperialism.

Ambis, the representative of Kenyan nationalists in Cairo, made a brief speech at the meeting, expressing support for the Ugandan people's struggle for independence. He said that it must be recognized that free and independent African countries will not be safe unless imperialism is completely driven out of Africa. He concluded by saying, "We want to be masters of our own destiny and will not allow interference in African affairs."

    乌干达国民大会党主席表示
    乌干达人民不获独立决不罢休
    新华社开罗6日电　乌干达国民大会主席约瑟夫·基瓦努卡5日晚上在这里举行的纪念“乌干达日”的大会上说，乌干达人民厌恶他们国内的外国统治，他们得不到独立，决不罢休。
    基瓦努卡说，他已经把一份备忘录交给了由乌干达总督任命来研究乌干达新宪法的委员会，表示了乌干达人民的这种决心。他还说，“我们已经向英国总督表明，乌干达充分准备争取自己的独立。”
    乌干达国民大会外事秘书约翰·凯耳在会上发言时谴责在乌干达宣布紧急状态的作法，并且说，在亚非各地举行“乌干达日”，对英帝国主义者是一个严重的警告。
    怯尼亚民族主义者在开罗的代表安比索在会上作了简短讲话，表示支持乌干达人民争取独立的斗争。他说，必须认清，除非把帝国主义完全从非洲赶走，否则自由和独立的非洲国家是不会安全的。他最后说，“我们要作自己命运的主人，决不许干涉非洲的事务。”
