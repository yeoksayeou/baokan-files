One morning in mid-July, before dawn, Luo Xingwang, the captain of the Luotang Production Team in Luohe Commune, Guixi County, Jiangxi Province, and the team members were already carrying rice buckets and shoulder poles down to the fields to harvest early rice.

The rice paddies were silent, and a gentle breeze rustled the grain. Suddenly, a dark figure moved in the field ahead, accompanied by a "shasha" sound. "Who could be here so early?" the captain wondered. "No one," everyone replied.

"Could it be a wild boar eating the grain?" someone suspected. "Quick! Let's go over there immediately!" As if giving an order, Captain Luo directed everyone to spread out and surround the area where the dark figure was.

"Captain Luo, you're here so early?" The dark figure turned out to be a person who greeted the captain.

"Ah, Xiao Chen! Why are you here alone and so quietly?" Captain Luo was taken aback. It was Chen Mingqing, a salesman from the Luohe State-Owned Store and a member of the Communist Youth League.

"Captain! Aren't you short of sickles and bamboo ropes? I brought them for you."

Captain Luo was stunned by Xiao Chen's words, wondering how he knew they were short of sickles.

The story was this: the Luotang Production Team had only purchased 200 sickles before the harvest. Later, as more laborers joined the harvest, they were still short of more than 50 sickles and 50 sets of bamboo ropes. Captain Luo knew that the local state-owned store had already distributed all the sickles and ropes to various teams, so he had to send a team member to the neighboring Yutang State-Owned Store to buy them. However, the Yutang store had also sold out of these items. The purchasing team member had to return disappointed. On his way back, he happened to meet Xiao Chen on the road and told him the whole story of trying to buy sickles and ropes. Chen Mingqing felt anxious as if his heart was on fire and immediately rushed back to the store to organize an agricultural tool processing and repair team to rush to make sickles and ropes. On this day, the farm tools were finished, but it was already late. He thought: The summer harvest and planting tasks are so tight, and I am a member of the Communist Youth League, so I must deliver these things tonight, even if I don't sleep. Then he organized his carrying pole, loaded it with sickles, ropes, hoes, as well as sugar, pastries, cigarettes, wine, and heatstroke prevention medicine, and hurried to the Luotang Production Team. When he arrived in Luotang, it was still dark, and the team members had not yet gone to the fields. He was afraid of waking everyone up, so he started cutting the rice in the field.

    小陈送镰刀
    7月中旬的一个早晨，天还没有亮，江西省贵溪县罗河公社罗塘生产队队长罗兴旺和社员们就抬着禾桶，担着箩筐下田收割早稻了。
    稻田里一片寂静，微风拂过，只听到谷子发出轻轻的沙沙声。突然，前面有一个黑影在田里晃动，同时还发出“刹刹”的响声。“这么早，有谁来了呢？”队长奇怪地问。“没有谁。”大家回答。
    “是不是野猪下田吃谷呢？”有人这样怀疑。“快！马上赶过去！”罗队长像下命令一样，大家立即分散开，把有黑影的地方包围起来。
      “罗队长，这么早就下田啦？”黑影原来是一个人，看见队长就问起话来。
    “啊，小陈！怎么一个人悄悄地来了？”罗队长吃了一惊，原来是罗河国营商店的营业员陈明清，一个共青团员。
    “队长！你们不是缺镰刀、箩索吗？我给你们送来了。”
    罗队长被小陈说得楞住了，心想他怎么知道我们缺镰刀呢？
    事情是这样的，罗塘生产队在收割前只买了二百张镰刀。后来，参加收割的劳动力增多了，还差五十多把镰刀和五十多套箩索。罗队长知道当地国营商店的镰刀、箩索等工具都分配到各队去了，只好派一个社员去邻社鱼塘国营商店购买。但是，鱼塘商店的这类商品也卖完了。购货的社员只好扫兴而归。当他回社时，碰巧在路上遇见小陈，他就把买镰刀、箩索的过程前前后后向小陈讲了一遍。陈明清听到这些情形后，心里像火烧一样的着急，立即赶回商店组织农具加工修理小组，赶制镰刀、箩索。这天，农具赶制好了，但是天已经晚了。他想：夏收夏种任务这么紧，我又是一个共青团员，今晚不睡觉也要把这些东西送去。接着便整理货担，装上镰刀、箩索、锄头，又装了食糖、糕点、烟、酒和防暑药品，向罗塘生产队赶去。到罗塘时，天还未亮，社员们还没下田，他怕惊醒大家，就在稻田里动手割起禾来。
