Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 26th. The United States recently held the so-called "Captive Nations Week." This is a vicious slander campaign by the US ruling clique to obstruct the relaxation of the international situation, interfere in the internal affairs of socialist countries, and attempt to provoke relations between socialist countries.

This movement was launched according to a resolution passed by the US Congress earlier this month and officially announced by President Eisenhower. The congressional resolution authorizes the President to issue a proclamation designating the third week of July as "Captive Nations Week." The President will continue to issue such proclamations annually until all so-called "enslaved nations throughout the world achieve freedom and independence."

The resolution passed by Congress used some of the most vicious words and phrases to smear the Soviet Union. It falsely stated that "Communist imperialism enslaves a large portion of the world's population, which is a mockery of the claim of peaceful coexistence among nations."

The resolution listed a string of names of countries that the United States considers to be "captive nations." It absurdly refers to truly independent socialist countries that have completely freed themselves from imperialist oppression and are building socialism, such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the People's Republic of China, as "captive nations." The resolution also absurdly lists China's territory of Tibet and many of the Soviet Union's republics as "captive nations." This is obviously a conspiracy by US imperialists to obliterate China's and the Soviet Union's sacred sovereignty over their territories and deliberately interfere in the internal affairs of China and the Soviet Union.

The resolution shamelessly stated that "these countries in dire straits look to the United States, as a bastion of human freedom, to take the lead in bringing them liberation and independence." The resolution also stated that the United States "should, through appropriate and official means," support "their desire to restore their freedom and independence." This means that the United States wants to continue to recruit counter-revolutionaries and national scum, carry out subversive activities in socialist countries, and even openly invade socialist countries.

US President Eisenhower also extensively slandered and smeared the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in his proclamation and at press conferences. The slander campaign launched by the United States was launched under the circumstances that the socialist camp has achieved unprecedentedly great achievements on all fronts, and the unity of socialist countries has been unprecedentedly consolidated, which shows how the US ruling clique is hostile to and afraid of the unity and strength of socialist countries. This slander campaign is also being carried out while the East-West Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference is being held and US Vice President Nixon is visiting the Soviet Union. This also shows that although the US ruling clique claims to want "peace," it is actually trying its best to poison relations between countries and the international atmosphere, and hinder the peaceful resolution of some major international issues.

### 毒化国际气氛　干涉社会主义国家内政  美国公然举行所谓“被奴役国家周”

    毒化国际气氛　干涉社会主义国家内政
    美国公然举行所谓“被奴役国家周”
    新华社26日讯　华盛顿消息：美国最近举行了所谓“被奴役国家周”，这是美国统治集团为了阻挠国际局势缓和，干涉社会主义国家内政并企图挑拨社会主义国家关系的一个恶毒的诽谤运动。
    这个运动是根据美国国会本月初通过的一项决议，并由艾森豪威尔总统明令宣布举行的。国会的决议授权总统颁布公告，规定7月的第三个星期为“被奴役国家周”。总统以后还将每年发表一次这样的公告，直到所谓“全世界一切被奴役国家获得自由和独立为止”。
    国会通过的决议选用了一些最恶毒的词句和字眼来污蔑苏联。它颠倒黑白地说，“共产帝国主义奴役世界上很大一部分人口，这是对各国间实现和平共处的主张的一个嘲弄。”
    决议罗列了一串美国认为是“被奴役国家”的名字。它荒谬地把彻底摆脱帝国主义压迫而正在建设社会主义的真正独立自主的社会主义国家像波兰、捷克斯洛伐克以及中华人民共和国等都说成是“被奴役国家”。决议同时还荒唐地把中国的领土西藏和苏联的许多加盟共和国也列为“被奴役国家”，这显然是美帝国主义者企图抹杀中、苏两国对自己领土的神圣主权，蓄意干涉中、苏两国内政的阴谋。
    决议毫不知耻地说，“这些处于水深火热中的国家指望作为人类自由的堡垒的美国起领导作用，给它们带来解放和独立”。决议还说，美国“应当通过适当的和官方的办法”来支持“他们恢复他们的自由和独立的愿望”。这就是说，美国要继续网罗反革命分子和民族败类，在社会主义国家中进行颠覆活动，甚至公开侵略社会主义国家。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔在公告中和在记者招待会上，也曾对苏联和其他社会主义国家大肆诽谤和污蔑。美国搞的这个诽谤运动是在社会主义阵营在各个战线上获得空前巨大的成就，社会主义各国的团结空前巩固的情况下发动的，这说明美国统治集团是如何敌视和害怕社会主义国家的团结和壮大。这个诽谤运动同时也是在东西方日内瓦外长会议正在举行，美国副总统尼克松访问苏联的时候进行的，这也说明美国统治集团虽然口口声声说要“和平”，但实际上却在竭力毒化国与国之间的关系和国际气氛，阻挠一些重大的国际问题的和平解决。
