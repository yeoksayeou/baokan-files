Xinhua News Agency, July 2nd: From June 15th to 25th, the national summer grain purchase work formed its first storage high tide. During these ten-plus days, the national average daily purchase and storage volume of wheat accelerated significantly. The purchase situation in the key wheat-producing areas in the South and North was good. As of June 28th, Henan Province had completed 80.37% of its wheat purchase plan, Sichuan Province 72.85%, Hebei Province 64.8%, and Jiangsu Province 62.5%. Among the one hundred and twenty-two counties and cities in Henan Province, thirty counties have completed the purchase plan; Nanchong and Leshan Special Districts in Sichuan Province, as well as twenty-nine counties and cities including Nanbu, Meishan, Longchang, and Hejiang, have also completed the purchase tasks. The progress of purchases in other provinces such as Shandong is also accelerating greatly.

After the wheat harvest was completed, various regions freed up more strength to strengthen the purchase work, and the enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and commune members to complete the national purchase task was high. The commune members of Jiande County in Zhejiang Province said: "When the big river is full, the small river overflows; a good harvest does not forget the Communist Party; the country, the commune, and everyone has a share, and the country and the people are prosperous." They put forward the slogans of selling grain early, selling good grain, and selling enough grain, and completed the summer grain purchase task in the first batch in the province.

Various regions have conscientiously implemented policies in the summer grain purchase work and rationally arranged the rations and seeds for commune members. Yunmeng County in Hubei Province made unified arrangements for summer harvest distribution and purchase work, and accurately calculated the output, rations, seeds, and unified purchase and sales figures from the production team to the county, so that everyone had a clear understanding, and many production teams overfulfilled the summer grain purchase tasks in one or two days or overnight.

Many regions have paid great attention to improving the quality of grain sent to the national treasury during the purchase work. In Henan Province, Shangqiu, Xiangcheng, and Xiangcheng counties, and Xuchang and Luohe cities, which completed the purchase tasks, superior-grade grain accounted for 97% and medium-grade grain accounted for 3%; 99% of the nine million catties of grain stored in Xiangcheng County was superior and medium-grade grain.

    口粮种子　合理安排
    夏粮入库形成高潮
    据新华社2日讯　自6月15日到25日，全国夏季粮食征购工作形成了第一个入库高潮。在这十多天内，全国小麦每天的平均征购入库量显著加快。南方和北方的重点产麦区征购情况都比较好。截至6月28日止，河南省已经完成小麦征购计划的80.37％，四川省完成72.85％，河北省完成64.8％，江苏省完成62.5％。河南省一百二十二个县市中已有三十个县全部完成了征购计划；四川省南充、乐山两个专区以及南部、眉山、隆昌、合江等二十九个县、市也都完成了征购任务。其他如山东等省的征购进度也正在大大加快。
    各地在小麦收割全部结束后，腾出了更多的力量来加强征购工作，广大干部和社员完成国家征购任务的情绪高涨。浙江省建德县的社员们说：“大河有水小河满，丰收不忘共产党，国有社有大家有，国家人民都富强。”他们提出了早售粮、售好粮、售足粮的口号，在全省第一批完成了夏粮征购任务。
    各地在夏粮征购工作中认真贯彻执行了政策，合理地安排了社员的口粮和种子。湖北省云梦县把夏收分配和征购工作作了统一安排，从生产队到县，精确地计算了产量、口粮、种子和统购统销的数字，使人人心中有底，不少生产队在一两天或一夜时间就超额完成了夏粮征购任务。
    许多地区在征购工作中都很注意提高送入国库粮食的质量。河南省完成征购任务的睢县、项城、襄城等三县和许昌、漯河两市上等粮占97％，中等粮占3％；项城县入库的九百万斤粮食中99％是上、中等粮。
