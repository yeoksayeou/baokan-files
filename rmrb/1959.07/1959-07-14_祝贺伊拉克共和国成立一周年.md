    Congratulations on the First Anniversary of the Founding of the Republic of Iraq
    Today, July 14th, is the glorious anniversary of the Iraqi people's overthrow of the tyrannical autocracy of the Faisal dynasty, the imperialist agent. The Republic of Iraq has been established for a full year. The Iraqi people are holding warm celebrations for the first anniversary of the Republic's birth.
    The Iraqi revolution was a heavy blow to the imperialist reactionary forces and a great encouragement to the national independence movements in the Middle East, Near East, Africa, and Asia. The Iraqi revolution paralyzed the Baghdad Pact, an important link in the so-called "global strategy" system of the US imperialism to launch wars of aggression. The imperialists absolutely did not expect that a volcano would suddenly erupt in a place they had meticulously controlled, on land subjected to long-term bloody suppression by the Faisal dynasty. The victory of the Iraqi revolution, along with the victory of the Cuban revolution in the "backyard" of US imperialism and the development of national and democratic revolutionary struggles in other Asian, African, and Latin American countries, clearly pointed out to the whole world, especially to all oppressed nations in Asia and Africa, that as long as they unite and fight resolutely, any ferocious enemy can be defeated.
    In the past year, under the leadership of Prime Minister Qasim, the Republic of Iraq has made significant achievements on the road to independent development. The Iraqi people have successively crushed counter-revolutionary rebellions supported and planned by imperialist and foreign interference forces, safeguarding the independence and security of the Republic of Iraq. The national economy of Iraq has also developed. In terms of foreign relations, the Republic of Iraq has pursued a policy of opposing imperialist aggression and adhering to peaceful neutrality. Iraq solemnly announced its withdrawal from the Baghdad Pact and the Eisenhower Doctrine, abolished the US-Iraq military assistance agreement, and cancelled the British military base. All of these cannot but have a positive impact on the struggle against colonialism and for the maintenance of national independence by the people of West Asia, especially the Arab countries. At the same time, the government of the Republic of Iraq established normal diplomatic relations with China, the Soviet Union, and many socialist countries. The economic and cultural ties between Iraq and socialist countries are also constantly strengthening.
    Of course, the young Republic of Iraq has not had a smooth journey in its growth. Imperialism hates the Iraqi revolution to the bone. The birth of the Republic of Iraq once caused imperialists to panic and fly into a rage. US and British imperialism and the hostile forces of the Republic of Iraq have tried every possible means to strangle the revolutionary achievements of the Iraqi people. However, the Iraqi people, supported by the people of the world, have achieved significant victories in the struggle against imperialism, foreign interventionists, and domestic reactionaries, and have been tempered in arduous struggles. Of course, imperialism will never be reconciled to defeat. Recently, while continuing to carry out subversion and interference conspiracies against Arab countries, imperialists have also stepped up their vicious tactics of political division and economic enticement, attempting to create divisions within the national forces of Arab countries, undermine the unity between Arab countries, and provoke relations between Arab countries and socialist countries. The ultimate goal of these activities by the imperialists is to stage a comeback and once again impose the shackles of colonialism on the people of the Arab countries. However, any conspiracy of imperialism will ultimately meet with complete bankruptcy in the face of the awakened people of the Arab countries.
    As we celebrate the first anniversary of the founding of the Republic of Iraq today, we are particularly pleased to see that the friendly and cooperative relations between the Chinese and Iraqi people have greatly developed on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit. During this year, our two countries have signed trade and cultural agreements, and representatives of the people of the two countries have conducted frequent friendly visits. The Chinese people are rejoicing over the birth of the Republic of Iraq and are happy about every achievement made by the Iraqi people in the cause of consolidating national independence and developing national economy and culture. The Chinese people sincerely wish the Iraqi people greater achievements in the struggle to safeguard national independence, develop democracy, and strengthen unity, wish the friendship between the Chinese and Iraqi people to develop day by day, and wish the Republic of Iraq prosperity and strength. We believe that the deep friendship between the Chinese and Iraqi people will flow forward forever like the Yangtze River and the Euphrates River.

### 祝贺伊拉克共和国成立一周年

    祝贺伊拉克共和国成立一周年
    今天，7月14日，是伊拉克人民推翻帝国主义代理人费萨尔王朝暴虐专政的光辉的纪念日。伊拉克共和国已经成立整整一个年头了。伊拉克人民正在为共和国诞生一周年举行热烈的庆祝。
    伊拉克革命，对于帝国主义反动势力是一个沉重的打击，对于中近东和亚非地区的民族独立运动是个很大的鼓舞。伊拉克革命使得作为美帝国主义发动侵略战争的所谓“全球战略”体系的重要环节之一——巴格达条约集团陷于瘫痪。帝国主义者绝对没有意料到，在他们千方百计严密控制的地方，在经过费萨尔王朝长期血腥镇压的土地上，一座火山突然爆发了。伊拉克革命的胜利，和美帝国主义“后院”里的古巴革命的胜利及其他亚、非、拉丁美洲一些国家民族、民主革命斗争的发展，向全世界，特别是向亚洲非洲的一切被压迫民族鲜明地指出了，只要团结起来，坚决斗争，任何凶恶的敌人都是可以被击败的。
    一年以来，伊拉克共和国在卡塞姆总理的领导下，在独立发展的道路上取得了重大的成就。伊拉克人民接二连三地粉碎了帝国主义和外国干涉势力支持和策划下的反革命叛乱，保卫了伊拉克共和国的独立和安全。伊拉克国家的民族经济也有所发展。在对外关系方面，伊拉克共和国奉行了反对帝国主义侵略和坚持和平中立的政策。伊拉克严正地宣布退出了巴格达条约集团和艾森豪威尔主义，废除了美伊军事援助协定，并取消了英国军事基地。所有这些，不能不对西亚地区尤其是对阿拉伯各国人民的反对殖民主义和维护民族独立的斗争，发生积极的影响。与此同时，伊拉克共和国政府同中国、苏联和许多社会主义国家建立了正常的外交关系。伊拉克同社会主义国家之间的经济和文化上的联系也在不断加强。
    当然，年轻的伊拉克共和国在自己的成长道路上不是一帆风顺的。帝国主义对于伊拉克的革命恨之入骨，伊拉克共和国的诞生曾经使帝国主义者惊慌失措，暴跳如雷。美英帝国主义和伊拉克共和国的敌对势力千方百计地企图扼杀伊拉克人民的革命成果。但是，得到全世界人民支持的伊拉克人民，在同帝国主义和外国干涉者以及国内反动派的斗争中，取得了重大的胜利，并且在艰巨的斗争中得到了锻炼。当然，帝国主义绝不会甘心失败的。最近以来，帝国主义者在对阿拉伯国家继续进行颠覆和干涉阴谋的同时，还加紧了政治分化和经济诱骗的恶毒手段，企图制造阿拉伯国家内部民族力量的分裂，破坏阿拉伯国家之间的团结，以及挑拨阿拉伯国家与社会主义国家之间的关系。帝国主义者的这些活动，其最终目的就是想卷土重来，再度把殖民主义的枷锁强加于阿拉伯各国人民的身上。但是，帝国主义的任何阴谋最后都将在觉醒了的阿拉伯各国人民面前，遭到彻底的破产。
    在今天庆祝伊拉克共和国一周年国庆的时候，我们特别高兴地看到，中伊两国人民的友好合作关系在和平共处五项原则和万隆精神的基础上有了很大的发展。这一年中间，我们两国签订了贸易和文化协定，两国人民的代表互相进行了频繁的友好访问。中国人民为伊拉克共和国的诞生而欢欣鼓舞，为伊拉克人民在巩固国家独立，发展民族经济和文化的事业中所获得的每一项成就而感到高兴。中国人民衷心地祝伊拉克人民在维护民族独立、发展民主和加强团结的斗争中获得更大的成就，祝中国和伊拉克两国人民之间的友谊日益发展，祝伊拉克共和国繁荣富强。我们相信，中伊两国人民之间的深厚友情将似长江和幼发拉底河一样永远向前奔流。
