Several Opinions on Paddy Field Management
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Crop Breeding and Cultivation Research Institute

(1) Emphasize basal fertilizer and topdressing for the spikes to promote the development of grains. Currently, mid-season rice and single-season late rice are in the tillering and young panicle differentiation stages. This stage is the most vigorous period of metabolism in the life of rice, and also the period when rice needs the most and fastest fertilizer. Sufficient fertility can promote the development of panicles, increase the length of panicles and the number of grains per panicle, reduce ineffective tillering, and increase yield. However, excessive or premature fertilization can also increase the rate of empty husks and accelerate the elongation of the last one to three leaves, causing lodging. Therefore, attention should be paid to mastering the timing of applying spike fertilizer. Generally, spike fertilizer should be applied about one month before heading (depending on the maturity of the crop or the nature of the fertilizer, it can be advanced or postponed by three to five days), which, in terms of the development stage, is the time when the spike growth point begins to differentiate. If there is a lack of fertilizer during the differentiation period of pistils and stamens (about half a month before heading), a small amount of quick-acting fertilizer can be applied again to help the development of florets and reduce unfilled grains. The type and quantity of topdressing should be determined according to the condition of the seedlings and the land. Generally, it is better to apply quick-acting fertilizers such as chemical fertilizers, fermented human manure, and green manure.

(2) Implement shallow water and moist irrigation. According to experience in various regions, long-term maintenance of a deep water layer in paddy fields will result in strong soil reducibility, which can easily form reducing substances such as biogas and hydrogen sulfide, affecting root growth, causing lodging, and even causing root rot and seedling death. Therefore, adopting shallow water and moist irrigation and appropriately increasing the number of sunning the fields is an effective way to prevent excessive growth and lodging of mid-season rice and single-season late rice in the early stage.

The irrigation method combining moistening (making the land reach a moist level) and water layer (maintaining a certain water level in the paddy field) created by the masses in various regions in 1958 is adapted to the requirements of close planting. Experiments conducted by the former East China Agricultural Science Research Institute in 1956-1957 proved that under the condition of paddy field moistening and water saturation, organic nutrients are easily transported to the roots of rice, which is conducive to root development; while water layer irrigation is easy to transport to the stems and leaves, which is conducive to the growth of the above-ground part. Therefore, the irrigation method combining moistening and water layer can adjust the relative growth relationship between the above-ground and underground parts, control excessive growth of stems and leaves, and have a significant effect on preventing lodging. However, in specific control, the number and degree of watering and field drying should be determined according to the different growth stages of rice, the color of the rice seedlings, the permeability of the soil, and the weather conditions such as overcast, sunny, cold, and hot.

(3) Remove weeds in the field and cultivate the fields multiple times. Cultivation can remove weeds, stir the soil, improve soil aeration, promote fertilizer decomposition, and promote rice root development, which is of great importance to achieving full seedlings, strong plants, large panicles, and many grains. Therefore, early cultivation, fine cultivation, and multiple cultivations are required. The principle of "fine, deep, and shallow" should be mastered in cultivation, that is, the first cultivation should be fine, the second cultivation should be deep, and the third cultivation should be shallow. During cultivation, the field water should generally be drained to a shallow level, and after cultivation, water should be added to sun the field to allow the soil to ventilate, increase the ground temperature, and promote root development, which has a significant effect on preventing lodging.

(4) Prevent and control pests in a timely manner. This year, the pest situation is fierce. If prevention and control are not carried out as soon as possible, a large number of symptoms such as dead hearts, hemp leaves, rotten stems, and lodging will appear in a short time, affecting yield. Therefore, all regions should strengthen pest forecasting and reporting work, strive to ensure that the preparation of medicines and equipment is sufficient, and adhere to the policy of "treating early, treating small, and treating thoroughly" to eliminate pests before they become prevalent. July, August, and September are the rainy season and flood season, and coastal areas are often invaded by typhoons, which directly threaten the safe growth of rice. We should strengthen the forecasting of flood and typhoon prevention work, repair drainage ditches, and prepare drainage equipment to take the initiative and avoid losses.

(5) Methods to save rice from excessive growth and lodging. The most fundamental ways to prevent lodging are deep plowing, reasonable fertilization, reasonable close planting, selection of lodging-resistant varieties, adoption of shallow water and moist irrigation, timely control of watering, drainage, and field drying, etc. This series of planting techniques are mutually influencing and mutually restricting. If we can tightly grasp every link, we can effectively prevent lodging. However, if excessive growth and lodging still occur due to improper control, the following methods can be taken to save the situation.

1. Drain and sun the field. If it is found that the rice seedlings are dark green and excessively growing, with drooping leaves or dew accumulating on the leaves in the morning, the water should be drained immediately and the field should be sunned. In addition, ropes can be used to pull off the dew, or methods such as deep cultivation and treading on the base of the plant can be used to save the situation.

2. Remove old leaves and cut leaf tips. If the above methods are ineffective, some old leaves can be removed in conjunction with sunning the field to facilitate ventilation and light transmission and promote the growth of strong plants. If the excessive growth is strong, some leaves can also be cut off. In the early stage of excessive growth, more can be cut; if cutting leaves in the later stage, do not cut off the last flag leaf.

3. For lodged rice plants after the ears are drooping and grains are scattering, if labor conditions permit, the ears lying underneath can be gently lifted and placed on the stalks of the front row, row by row, so that the ears receive more sunlight and do not germinate and become moldy. Some high-yield fields use the method of tying bundles and tying ropes, which can also be adopted.

Lodged rice is most susceptible to rice planthoppers and leafhoppers, causing serious yield reduction. Therefore, carefully controlling pests in lodged rice fields is also an important measure to reduce lodging losses. (Attached picture)

    对水稻田间管理的几点意见
    中国农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所
      （一）重施穗肥攻穗攻粒。目前各地中稻、一季晚稻正处在分蘖和幼穗分化阶段。这个阶段是水稻一生新陈代谢最旺盛的时期，也是水稻需要肥料最多、最快的时期。肥力充足，能促使穗子发育，增加穗长和每穗粒数，减少无效分蘖，提高产量。但是，施肥过多过早也会增加空壳率，使最后一到三片叶子加快伸长，引起倒伏。所以施穗肥的时期应当注意掌握。施穗肥一般应在出穗前一个月左右（依作物成熟的迟早或肥料的性质，可提前或推迟三、五天），按发育时期说，就是穗生长点开始分化时期。雌雄蕊分化期（约抽穗前半个月）如果有缺肥现象，也可再薄施速效肥一次，帮助颖花的发育，减少不实粒。追肥的种类和数量要看苗看地决定，一般以施用化肥、发酵的人粪尿、绿肥等速效肥为好。
    （二）实行浅水湿润灌溉。根据各地经验，稻田长期保持较深水层，土壤还原性强，易形成沼气及硫化氢等还原性物质，影响根系生长，发生倒伏，甚至产生烂根死苗。因此采用浅水湿润灌溉，适当的增加晒田次数，是防止中稻和一季晚稻早期徒长倒伏的有效办法。
    1958年各地群众创造的湿润（使土地达到湿润程度）与水层（稻田保持一定的水位）相结合的灌溉法，是适应密植要求的。1956—1957年两年原华东农业科学研究所试验证明，在稻田湿润、水分饱和的状况下，有机养料易于向水稻根部运输，利于根系发育；而用水层灌溉，即易向茎叶部运输，利于地上部生长。因而湿润与水层相结合的灌溉，可以调节地上部和地下部相对生长的关系，控制茎叶徒长，对防止倒伏有显著作用。但具体掌握时，应根据水稻不同生育期、稻苗的颜色、土壤透水性的好坏，天气的阴、晴、冷、热等，决定灌水和烤田的次数和程度。
    （三）清除田间杂草，多次耘田。耘田可以清除杂草，搅动土壤，增进土壤的通气性，促进肥料的分解，促进稻根的发育，对达到苗全株壮，穗大粒多有极大作用。因此要求早耘、精耘、多耘。耘田要掌握“精、深、浅”的原则，即头遍要精，二遍要深，三遍要浅。耘田时一般要将田水放浅，耘田后要放水晒田，使土壤通气，提高地温，促使根系发育，对防止倒伏有显著作用。
    （四）及时防治虫害。今年虫害来势较凶，如不及早防治，就会在很短时间内，出现大量枯心、麻叶、烂秆、倒伏等现象影响产量。因此各地应加强虫情预测预报工作，药械准备力求充足，本“治早、治小、治了”的方针，在虫害盛发前，一网打尽。7、8、9月份正是雨季、汛期，沿海更常有台风侵袭，这些都直接威胁水稻的安全生长。应加强防水、防风的预报工作，并修好排水沟渠，准备好排水设备，争取主动，避免损失。
      （五）挽救水稻徒长倒伏的办法。防止倒伏最根本的办法是深耕，合理施肥，合理密植，选用抗倒伏品种，采用浅水湿润灌溉，适时的掌握好灌水排水和晒田时间等等。这一系列的栽种技术是相互影响，相互制约的。我们如能紧紧掌握每一个环节，就能有效的防止倒伏。但是如果因掌握不当，仍然发生徒长倒伏，还可以采取下列办法挽救。
    1、排水晒田。发现稻苗浓绿徒长，发生披叶或在早晨有露水搭蓬现象，应立即放水晒田。此外，还可以用绳子拉去露水，或采用深耘田、踩蔸等办法挽救。
    2、打老叶、割叶尖。如用以上办法不生效，可结合晒田打掉一部分老叶子，以利通风透光，促使植株粗壮。如徒长势猛，还可以割去一部分叶子。早期徒长，可以多割一点；如在后期割叶，不要把最后一片剑叶割掉。
    3、稻株低头散粒后倒伏的，如果劳力条件许可，也可以把倒在下面的穗子轻轻提起，放在前排的禾秆上，一行搭一行，使穗子多受阳光，不致发芽霉烂。有些丰产田使用扎把子、绊绳子的方法，也可以采用。
    倒伏的水稻最易罹稻飞虱和浮尘子为害而造成严重减产，因此在倒伏稻田认真除治虫害，也是减少倒伏损失的一个重要措施。（附图片）
