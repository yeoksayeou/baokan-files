Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 19th: China's first ultrasonic academic conference was recently held in Wuchang. More than 100 researchers from the Institutes of Electronics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences and its branches in various provinces, as well as related units, participated in the conference.

Wang Jiaji, Vice President of the Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, spoke at the conference. Ma Dayou, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Institute of Electronics, and Ying Chongfu, Director of the Ultrasonic Research Office, introduced the general development of ultrasonics in recent years. They pointed out that ultrasonics is an emerging science, and China only began to engage in scientific research in this field in 1951. Since the formulation of the national long-term plan for the development of science and technology in 1956 and the Great Leap Forward last year, China's ultrasonics has developed rapidly. At present, this science has begun to be applied in many aspects. Certain achievements and experiences have been obtained in research on using ultrasound to diagnose tumors, improve the quality of high-grade alloy steel, detect flaws in metals, influence the growth of organisms, and manufacture magnetostrictive materials that generate ultrasound. The scientific and technological team engaged in this research is growing.

During the conference, workers from all over the country engaged in ultrasonic research extensively exchanged experiences, made more than 20 special reports, held 10 special symposiums, and exchanged views on some important academic issues.

The conference believes that in order to ensure the quality of research work, it is necessary to attach importance to the evaluation of research results, strengthen metrological work, and strive for accurate data and unified standards. The conference also emphatically pointed out that in ultrasonic research work, it is necessary to further study and explore the basic theoretical issues related to the propagation and processing mechanisms of ultrasonic waves. Since ultrasonics is an emerging science with a wide range of applications, research work often requires mastering specialized knowledge in many aspects. Therefore, the conference highly valued communist collaboration, requiring all regions and units to universally strengthen collaboration and connections.

    促进各地区普遍加强协作和联系
    我国首次举行超声学术会议
    新华社武汉19日电　我国第一次超声学术会议最近在武昌举行。中国科学院和各省分院所属电子学研究所和有关单位的研究人员一百多人参加了这次会议。
    中国科学院武汉分院副院长王家楫在会上讲了话。电子学研究所筹备委员会副主任马大猷、超声研究室主任应崇福等，分别在会上介绍了近年来超声学的发展概况。他们指出，超声学是一门新兴的科学，我国直到1951年才开始从事这方面的科学研究。从1956年国家制订科学技术发展的远景规划和去年大跃进以来，我国超声学有了较快的发展。目前，这门科学已在不少方面开始得到应用。在研究用超声诊断肿瘤，提高高级合金钢的质量，对金属探伤，影响生物的生长，以及在制造产生超声的磁致伸缩材料等方面，已经取得了一定的成就和经验。从事这方面研究的科学技术队伍正在成长。
    会议期间，来自全国各地的从事超声学研究的工作者广泛地交流了经验，作了二十多次专题报告，举行了十次专题座谈会，并就一些重要的学术问题交换了意见。
    会议认为，为了保证研究工作的质量，必须重视研究成果的鉴定，加强计量工作，求得数据精确，标准统一。会议还强调地指出，在超声的研究工作上，必须进一步研究探讨有关超声波的传播、处理的机制等基本理论问题。由于超声学是一门新兴的科学，应用的范围广泛，往往一项研究工作需要掌握多方面的专门知识，因此会议十分重视共产主义大协作，要求各地区之间、单位之间普遍地加强协作和联系。
