    The Nanjing Teaching Instrument Factory, starting with solving quality problems, mobilized the masses, strengthened the technical responsibility system, rectified the technological regulations, and then adjusted the management structure, and improved and formulated necessary rules and regulations. After more than a month of improvement, the factory's enterprise management level has been significantly improved, the production outlook has been renewed, and the quality of some major products and parts processing has been greatly improved.
    In mid-April of this year, the factory's employees, in the increase production and economize movement, focused on checking problems such as low product quality and high scrap rate of parts. After analysis, the Party committee believed that the reasons for these problems, in addition to the leadership's one-sided view of emphasizing output and neglecting quality in ideology, also included a certain degree of confusion in management. In view of this situation, the factory leadership relied on the masses to vigorously improve enterprise management. Their approach was: The first step was to address some urgent problems that affected product quality, review the new product drawings, and rectify the old product processes. For example, in the past, the revision of new product drawings lacked the necessary system. This time, a new product review team was formed, headed by the deputy director of technology and with the participation of engineering and technical personnel. They reviewed the drawings while manufacturing molds and gauges. This not only strictly enforced the new product trial production procedures, avoiding quality problems after putting it into production, but also enabled technical preparations to be completed as soon as possible, so that new products could be put into production early. The second step was to focus on some fundamental issues in enterprise management, starting from the needs of production development, adjust the management structure, and formulate necessary rules and regulations. These included: changing the original economic, technical, and administrative offices, which were subdivided too much, into production planning, technology, inspection, finance, and capital construction departments established by specialty; the tool manufacturing, paint wood, electroplating and other auxiliary production departments, which were originally merged into the production workshops with the decentralization of authority, were also centralized as necessary, and tool, paint wood and other workshops were established; at the same time, a responsibility system from top to bottom was established, such as in product inspection, a graded inspection system was established with the factory level managing finished products and material inspection, and the workshop managing parts. The scope of responsibilities at all levels was also stipulated in product design and financial and planning management.
    In the process of improving enterprise management, this factory has always implemented the mass line of work. Whether it is rectifying processes or adjusting management structures, improving and formulating rules and regulations, it has fully mobilized the masses to repeatedly debate. At the same time, the Party committee has paid attention to strengthening centralized leadership, comprehensively analyzing and judging according to the opinions of the masses, and drawing conclusions. In this way, the masses can freely express their opinions and feel comfortable, so that they consciously abide by the various rules and regulations, and the rules and regulations can meet the needs of production and avoid one-sidedness. The specific approach is: first divide the problems in various aspects into special topics and give them to the masses for discussion to put forward plans, then summarize the plans put forward by the masses, and then launch a large debate among the masses with several plans for one problem. For example, in the inspection system, there were initially three plans. One advocated that the inspection of finished products and parts should still be carried out entirely in the workshop, and the factory inspection department should only be responsible for sampling inspection of finished products; one advocated that all inspections should be centralized in the factory department; and one advocated that a graded management method should be adopted. After repeated debates, the Party committee analyzed and believed that to improve quality and improve and establish a responsibility system, it must be based on the conscious basis of the masses, and it must consider strengthening technical supervision and giving play to the consciousness of the masses. Therefore, it was finally decided to adopt a graded inspection system, which the masses generally felt satisfied with. Workers in the Second Workshop and the Third Workshop also voluntarily formulated guarantees to abide by the inspection system.
    Since the rectification and strengthening of management, a new atmosphere has emerged in this factory. Among the workers, the atmosphere of everyone paying attention to quality from parts processing to assembly has been formed. After the electric meter workshop's meter core group rectified the process, the workers copied the new process into big-character posters and posted them in front of themselves; some workers also used their rest time to memorize the parts of the process regulations related to their own operations in their hearts, and strictly followed the process during assembly. As a result, the rework rate of meter cores decreased by 40% within half a month, which was lower than the administrative regulations. The workers in the optical workshop's round plane group not only abided by the process to ensure product quality, but also carried out technical innovation to save raw materials. In May, they implemented a multi-saw blade blanking method, which changed one sawing of a piece of glass to three pieces at a time, increasing efficiency by three times; they also tried to reuse the emery used for grinding glass, saving 1,300 yuan in May alone. The quality of the factory's products is constantly improving. According to statistics, in May, the comprehensive qualification rate of parts processing increased to 98.68% (the indicator was 98%), and the rework rate of small multimeter finished products decreased by 4% compared with the planned target. In early June, the qualification rate of parts processing further increased to 98.71%, and the planned targets were also exceeded in terms of total output value, cost, and other aspects.

    从上到下职责分明
    南京教学仪器厂改进企业管理人人讲究质量个个关心工艺
    据新华日报消息　南京教学仪器厂发动群众从解决质量问题入手，加强了技术责任制，整顿了工艺规程，进而调整了管理机构，健全和订立了必要的规章制度。经过一个多月的改进，全厂企业管理水平有显著提高，生产面貌一新，一些主要产品及零件加工质量有很大改进。
    今年4月中旬，这个厂的职工在增产节约运动中，集中地检查了产品质量不高，零件报废率大等问题。党委经过分析，认为产生这些问题的原因，除领导思想上存在重产量、轻质量的片面观点外，在管理工作上还存在一定程度的混乱现象。根据这一情况，工厂领导方面依靠群众大力改进了企业管理工作。他们的作法是：第一步针对影响产品质量的一些迫切需要解决的问题，审查了新产品图纸，整顿了老产品的工艺。如过去修改新产品图纸缺乏必要的制度，这次以技术副厂长为首，工程技术人员参加，组成了新产品审查小组，一面审核图纸，一面制造模具量具，这样既严格了新产品试制程序，避免在投入生产后发生质量问题，同时又能尽快地做好技术准备，使新产品及早投入生产。第二步是围绕企业管理工作中一些带有根本性的问题，从生产发展的需要出发，调整了管理机构，订立了必要的规章制度。其中包括：将原来分工过细的经济、技术、行政三个办公室，改为按专业建立的生产计划、技术、检验、财务、基建等科室；原来随着权限下放合并到各生产车间的工具制造、漆木、电镀等辅助生产部门，也加以必要的集中，建立了工具、漆木等车间；同时建立了从上到下的责任制，如在产品检验方面，建立了厂级管成品、材料检验，车间管零件的分级检验制。在产品设计以及财务、计划管理等方面，也都规定了各级的职责范围。
    这个厂在改进企业管理过程中，自始至终贯彻了群众路线的工作方法，无论是整顿工艺或调整管理机构，健全和订立规章制度，都充分发动群众反复进行辩论，同时党委注意加强了集中领导，根据群众意见，全面分析、判断，做出结论。这样，既使群众能各抒己见，心情舒畅，从而自觉地遵守各项规章制度，又能使规章制度切合生产需要，避免产生片面性。具体做法是：先将各方面问题分成专题，交给群众讨论，提出方案，然后将群众提出的方案加以归纳，再发动群众展开一个问题几个方案的大辩论。如在检验制度方面，开始就有三种方案，一种主张成品、零件检验仍然全部放在车间，厂检验科只管成品的抽检工作；一种主张全部集中在厂部；一种主张采取分级管理的办法。经过反复辩论以后，党委进行了分析，认为提高质量，健全和建立责任制，必须建立在群众自觉的基础上，既要考虑加强技术监督，又要发挥群众的自觉性，因此最后确定采取分级检验制，群众普遍感到满意。二车间和三车间工人还自动订立了遵守检验制的保证。
    整顿和加强管理工作以来，这个厂出现了一片新气象。在职工群众中，从零件加工到装配，人人讲究质量的风气已经形成。电表车间表芯组在整顿工艺以后，工人们把新工艺抄写成大字报，贴在自己面前；有的工人还利用休息时间，将工艺规程中与自己操作有关的部分熟读牢记在心中，装配时严格按照工艺操作。结果表芯返修率在半个月内下降了40％，比行政规定的指标还要低。光学车间滚圆平面组工人不仅人人遵守工艺，保证产品质量，还大搞技术革新，节约原材料。5月份，他们实行多锯片下料法，使一次锯一片玻璃改为一次锯三片，效率提高三倍；磨玻璃用的金刚砂，他们也尽量回用，5月一个月就节约了一千三百元。全厂产品质量不断提高。据统计，5月份零件加工综合合格率提高到98.68％（指标为98％），小万用表成品退修率比计划指标下降了4％，6月上旬零件加工合格率更提高到98.71％，在总产值、成本等方面也都超额完成了计划指标。
