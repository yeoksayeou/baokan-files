Post-editing notes:

    Running schools thriftily can save funds and materials, saving capital for socialist construction; more importantly, it can raise the ideological awareness of young students and establish the virtue of diligence and frugality. If we conduct thorough and meticulous education on hard work and plain living for young students in our daily lives, we will be able to cultivate cadres for the country who are honest, upright, diligent and frugal. As long as we pay attention to diligence and thrift in running various undertakings, and individuals pay attention to rational arrangements for their lives, we will be able to accelerate the construction of socialism, and our lives will be able to become more beautiful and happy.

    勤俭办校
    勤俭办校，能够节约经费、物资，为社会主义建设节约资金；更重要的是提高青年学生的思想觉悟，树立勤俭朴素的美德。我们在日常生活中深入细致地对青年学生进行艰苦朴素的教育，就能够为国家培养出廉洁奉公、勤俭可风的干部。只要我们注意克勤克俭地办各种事业，个人又注意合理安排生活，我们就能够加速建设社会主义，生活就有可能过得更加美满幸福。
