In order to save labor and increase work efficiency, Putian is massively repairing and manufacturing threshing tools.

According to the Fujian Daily, Putian County, Fujian, is implementing the principle of "repairing old tools as the main task, supplemented by manufacturing new ones," and is actively repairing and manufacturing threshing tools for the summer harvest. The county now has 1,600 threshing machines. After these threshing machines are promoted during the summer harvest, they can save a large amount of labor.

Based on the new situation of this year's planting of more than 70,000 mu of japonica rice and the increased task of summer harvest threshing, the Putian County Party Committee convened a county-wide on-site appraisal meeting of summer harvest and summer planting tools as early as May, focusing on the issue of threshing tools. The meeting adopted the method of on-site testing and comparison, unified the understanding of the use of threshing tools, and determined the principle of "repairing old tools as the main task, supplemented by manufacturing new ones." Through mass appraisal, several types of threshing machines were finalized. After the meeting, the county's fourteen main farm implement factories carried out repair and manufacturing work mainly focused on repairing and manufacturing threshing tools. Communes and production teams conducted on-site experiments, using comparative performances of manual threshing and threshing machine threshing to educate the masses with facts, so that they would be happy to promote and use threshing machines to improve work efficiency.

Now, in addition to the 1,400 threshing machines from last year, which have all been repaired, more than 200 new Hangzhou-style, Gongnong-style, and power threshing machines have also been manufactured.

    节省劳力　提高工效
    莆田大量修造脱粒工具
    据福建日报消息　福建莆田县贯彻“修旧为主、新制为辅”的方针，积极修造夏收脱粒工具。现在全县已有打谷机一千六百部，这批打谷机在夏收中推广后，可以节省大批劳动力。
    莆田县委根据今年种植粳稻七万多亩，夏收脱粒工作任务加重的新情况，早在5月间就召开了全县夏收夏种工具现场评比会，着重研究了脱粒工具问题。会议采取实地试验、对比的办法，统一了对使用脱粒工具的认识，确定了“修旧为主，新制为辅”的方针。并且通过群众鉴定，定型了几种打谷机。会后，全县十四个主要农具厂就开展了以赶修、赶制脱粒工具为主的修造工作。各公社和生产队纷纷进行实地试验，通过人工脱粒和打谷机脱粒的对比表演，以事实教育群众，使他们乐于推广、使用打谷机提高工效。
    现在，全县除了去年的一千四百部打谷机已全部修理好以外，还新制了杭州式、工农式和动力打谷机共二百多部。
