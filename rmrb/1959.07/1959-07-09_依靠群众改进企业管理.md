Relying on the Masses to Improve Enterprise Management
Factory Director of Nanjing Teaching Instrument Factory, Hua Yucheng

    During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, under the leadership of the Party, our factory launched a massive mass movement, broke down superstitions, liberated our thinking, carried out a major technical revolution, and implemented significant reforms in management, which promoted rapid production development. The total output value increased by 108% compared to 1957, new products tripled, and the quality of products also improved significantly. In the first quarter of this year, encouraged by the continuing Great Leap Forward, our factory overfulfilled its plan, with an output value increase of 183% compared to the same period last year. However, there were also some problems in our work, such as a decline in the quality of certain products.

    In order to seriously improve our work and promote the continued Great Leap Forward in production, starting in mid-April, our factory launched a production inspection centered on improving product quality, with the participation of the workforce. According to the problems exposed by the masses, the main problems in production at that time were lax process discipline and a high rate of scrapped parts. Analyzing the reasons, in addition to the factory leadership having a certain one-sided understanding of the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, the main problem was that there were some shortcomings in management, manifested in some relaxation of centralized leadership and professional management, and some excessive decentralization of authority. Therefore, after the masses inspected production, the Party Committee decided to focus on management and mobilize the masses for a major rectification and reform. After more than a month of effort, a new management order has been initially established in the factory, and product quality has also improved.

    Starting with Solving Current Key Issues
    Comprehensively Improving Enterprise Management

    The major rectification and reform of our factory's management work started with solving the key to enterprise production—the quality problem—and aimed at comprehensively improving the level of enterprise management. The reason we started with solving the quality problem is that, judging from the factory's situation at the time, process discipline was lax, product inspection was uncontrolled, and the phenomenon of production not following blueprints and processes was relatively common. The quality of the 1,500x microscopes and universal electrical meters, which were being produced in large quantities, had declined, and even received criticism from users. Therefore, we first rectified these urgent problems that affected product quality. After such rectification, good results were quickly reflected in production.

    However, rectifying enterprise management solely from the perspective of solving the key to current production cannot comprehensively improve the level of enterprise management. For example, after rectifying the process, the quality improved, but to greatly improve quality, it also involves a series of fundamental issues in technical management, such as the inspection system, new product trial production procedures, technical innovation appraisal, and blueprint process management. After the process rectification came to an end, we adjusted the management structure and established necessary rules and regulations based on mass debates and starting from the needs of production development. As a result, the overall appearance of enterprise management in the factory changed significantly, and production made obvious progress. For example, the scrap rate of castings in early June decreased to 4.05%. In terms of metalworking, the comprehensive qualification rate of parts processing in May was 98.68%, and in early June, it further increased to 98.71%.

    Both Seeking Advice Widely and Making Decisive Decisions

    In this process of rectifying enterprise management, we consistently implemented the working method of "seeking advice widely and making decisive decisions," mobilized the masses to speak out freely, contend freely, and debate freely, sought advice and wisdom from the masses, and listened to opinions from all sides. We organized two mass-based airing of views and debate sessions on issues such as the management system and rules and regulations. Each debate was conducted several times repeatedly from bottom to top and from top to bottom. The masses aired their views, debated enthusiastically and earnestly, and the issues were debated thoroughly. The opinions of people from all sides were fully expressed, which made the rectification and reform based on a broad mass foundation. Every decision on every issue was fully discussed by the workers' representative assembly, and the "three-in-one" method was adopted. This ensured that the rectification and reform could be considered as thoroughly and comprehensively as possible, preventing one-sidedness.

    Through the work of the previous stage, we deeply realized that: the method of using the airing of views, debate, and big-character posters to carry out rectification can quickly distinguish between advantages and disadvantages, identify right and wrong, unify thinking, and find practical common answers to solve problems. It can also allow people with various opinions (including positive and negative opinions) to express their views freely, feel comfortable, and finally reach a consensus, laying a good foundation for future implementation. For example, during this discussion on the centralization and decentralization of tool manufacturing and repair forces, everyone advocated that the factory department should establish a centralized tool workshop this year. But on the question of how to establish it, some people advocated complete centralization, leaving no workshops; others disagreed, arguing that if everything was concentrated in the tool workshop, even tool repairs would have to be planned with the tool workshop, taking three to five days for turnaround, which would inevitably affect production. The consensus reached after such repeated discussions was: the factory department should establish a centralized tool workshop, and each production workshop should retain a certain number of technicians and tool repair forces to solve tool repair and other problems in a timely manner. Obviously, this is much more appropriate than simply and indiscriminately centralizing tool manufacturing and repair forces.

    Rely on the Department and Rely on the Workers

    Through mass airing of views and debates, we basically solved the problem of combining professional management and mass management in the rectification of enterprise management. In our factory's management work, there have been two different situations: one was before the large-scale mass movement last year, when we unilaterally emphasized that a few people "manage" and a few people "implement," and as a result, management work was cold and deserted, and the enthusiasm of the masses was limited to a certain extent; after the enterprise launched a large-scale mass movement, we relaxed professional management and decentralized too much power to workshops and groups, as a result, many matters that must be managed uniformly were unattended, causing losses to production, and the masses had many complaints.

    In this rectification and reform, on the one hand, in response to the shortcomings of the current enterprise in relaxing professional management, we mobilized the masses to repeatedly discuss and finally reach a consensus, established specialized departments, and improved and formulated necessary rules and regulations, so that the production order became more normal; on the other hand, we still adhered to the system of workers' representative assemblies and the form of group management in which the masses participate in management. The establishment of departments and the formulation of rules and regulations were fully discussed by the workers' representative assembly. While improving the management organization and rules and regulations, we mobilized the masses to summarize the experience of group management, adjusted the group's part-time administrators, and strengthened the accounting of the team. After doing this, not only did the factory's production order become new, but also group management became more active than before. Some part-time administrators in the group who originally had nothing to do now have things to do; originally, one statistician was too busy, but now, after adjusting and re-electing statisticians, many groups can complete the statistics of various indicators of a group in only fifteen minutes per shift.

    The Responsibility System Must Be Established on
    The Basis of Mass Consciousness

    In this rectification of enterprise management, we repeatedly mobilized the masses to carry out airing of views and debates. The process of airing of views and debates is actually also a process of self-education for the masses. We feel that it is very important to strengthen political and ideological work in establishing and improving rules and regulations. Establishing and improving rules and regulations is not only a business construction, but also a meticulous ideological construction work. Only by carrying out ideological work can we lay a deep mass foundation for the implementation of various rules and regulations. For example, we mobilized many groups to focus on discussing the importance of strengthening inspection and strictly enforcing process discipline. In the discussion, the watch core group of the Fourth Workshop specifically analyzed the harm of not operating according to the process, and finally unanimously requested the workshop to help them formulate and improve the process regulations; after the new process was issued, they wrote it in large characters and posted it in front of the workbench, checking the process while operating. When improving various professional management systems, we mobilized department management personnel to seriously discuss issues such as departments must face the workshop and serve production. Later, they were generally able to consciously and proactively go deep into the workshop to solve some problems in production.

    依靠群众改进企业管理
    南京教学仪器厂厂长　花育诚
    在1958年大跃进中，我厂在党的领导下，通过大搞群众运动，破除迷信、解放思想，大搞技术革命，管理工作进行大破大立，促进了生产迅速发展。总产值比1957年增长了108％，新产品翻了三倍，产品质量也有不少提高。今年一季度，在继续大跃进的形势鼓舞下，我厂超额完成了计划，产值比去年同期增长了183％。但是，工作中也有一些问题，如某些产品质量有下降现象等。
    为了认真改进工作，促进生产继续大跃进，从4月中旬起，我厂发动职工群众开展了以提高产品质量为中心的生产检查。从群众揭露的问题看来，当时生产上主要的问题是工艺纪律松懈，零件报废率较高。分析其原因，除工厂领导思想上对多快好省的建设方针掌握上有一定的片面性外，主要是在管理工作方面存在着一些缺点，表现在集中领导和专业管理有些放松，权限下放也有些过了头的地方。因此，在群众检查生产之后，党委确定抓住管理工作，发动群众进行大整大改。前后经过一个多月的努力，厂内已初步建立起新的管理秩序，产品质量也有了提高。
    从解决当前关键入手
      全面改进企业管理
    我厂管理工作的大整大改，是从解决企业生产关键——质量问题入手，又从全面提高企业管理水平着眼来进行的。我们所以要从解决质量问题入手，是因为从企业当时的情况看，工艺纪律松弛，产品检验自流，生产中不按图纸、工艺生产的现象比较普遍，正在大量生产的一千五百倍显微镜和万用电表的质量有下降现象，甚至受到用户来信批评。因此，我们首先就针对影响产品质量的这些迫切需要解决的问题，进行了整顿。经过这样的整顿，很快就在生产上反映出良好的效果。
    但是，单从解决当前生产关键入手来整顿企业管理，还不能全面地提高企业管理水平。例如，经过整顿工艺，质量有了好转，但要大大提高质量，还涉及到检验制度、新产品试制程序、技术革新鉴定、图纸工艺管理等一系列的技术管理方面的根本问题。我们在工艺整顿告一段落以后，便在群众辩论的基础上，从生产发展需要出发，调整了管理机构，订立了必要的规章制度。结果全厂企业管理面貌起了显著变化，生产有明显进步。如铸件报废率6月上旬下降为4.05％。金工加工方面，5月份零件加工综合合格率是98.68％，6月上旬又提高到98.71％。
      既要多谋又要善断
    在这次整顿企业管理过程中，我们自始至终贯彻了“多谋善断”的工作方法，发动群众大鸣大放大辩论，向群众求谋问计，兼听各个方面的意见。我们前后就管理体制和规章制度等问题，组织了两次群众性的鸣放辩论，每次辩论都自下而上、自上而下地搞几次反复，群众鸣放、争论热烈认真，问题辩得深透，各方面人的意见都充分发表了出来，这就使整改建立在广泛的群众基础上。每一个问题的决定，也都经过职工代表大会充分讨论，同时采用了“三结合”的办法，这样才能使整改尽可能地考虑得周到、全面，防止产生片面性。
    经过前一阶段的工作，我们深深体会到：采用大鸣大放大辩论的方法进行整改，既能迅速分清利弊，辨明是非，以统一思想，找出切合实际的解决问题的共同答案，又能使持有各种意见的人（包括正反面意见）各抒己见，心情舒畅，最后取得一致的意见，为今后贯彻实行打下良好的基础。如这次讨论工具制造、修理力量的集中与分散问题时，大家主张今年厂部应集中建立工具车间。但在怎样建立的问题上，有人主张全部集中，车间一个不留；另外有人不同意，理由是如果什么都集中在工具车间，连修理工具也要到工具车间订计划，周转三天五天，必然会影响生产。经过这样反复讨论后取得的一致意见是：厂部集中建立工具车间，各生产车间保留一定的技术人员和工具修理力量，及时解决工具修理等问题。这样，显然比简单地不加区别地把工具修造力量集中起来，妥善得多。
    依靠科室也依靠工人群众
    经过群众性的鸣放和辩论，我们在整顿企业管理中基本上解决了专业管理和群众性管理相结合的问题。我厂在管理工作中，曾经出现过两种不同的情况：一是在去年大搞群众运动之前，那时曾片面地强调了少数人“管”、少数人“贯”，结果管理工作冷冷清清，群众的积极性受到了一定的限制；企业大搞群众运动之后，我们又放松了专业管理，将权力过多地下放到了车间、小组，结果许多必须统一管理的事无人过问，给生产带来了损失，群众意见也很大。
    在这次整改中，我们一方面针对当前企业中放松专业管理的缺点，发动群众反复讨论，最后取得一致意见，建立了专业科室，健全和订立了必要的规章制度，使生产秩序更加正常；另一方面，我们仍然坚持了职工代表大会制和小组管理这样的群众参加管理的形式。科室的建立和规章制度的制订，都通过了职工代表大会的充分讨论。在健全管理机构、规章制度的同时，我们发动群众总结了小组管理的经验，调整了小组的业余管理员，加强了班组核算。这样做以后，不仅全厂生产秩序为之一新，而且小组管理也较前更加活跃了。原来小组里有的业余管理员没有事做的，现在有事做了；原来一个统计员忙不过来，现在经过调整增选了统计员，许多小组每班只要十五分钟就能完成一个小组的各项指标的统计工作。
      责任制必须建立在
      群众自觉的基础上
    在这次整顿企业管理中，我们反复发动群众开展了鸣放辩论。鸣放辩论的过程，实际上也是群众自我教育的过程。我们感到，在建立和健全规章制度中，加强政治思想工作很重要。建立健全规章制度不仅是一项业务建设，而且是一项细致的思想建设工作。只有充分进行思想工作，才能为各项规章制度的贯彻打下深厚的群众基础。例如，我们发动许多小组着重讨论了加强检验、严格工艺纪律的重要性。四车间表芯组在讨论中，具体分析了不按工艺操作的危害，最后一致要求车间帮助他们订立和健全工艺规程；当新的工艺发下以后，他们都把它用大字写起来贴在工作台前，一边操作一边核对工艺。在健全各项专业管理制度时，我们发动科室管理人员认真讨论了科室必须面向车间、为生产服务等问题，后来，他们一般都能自觉地、主动地深入车间，解决生产中的一些问题。
