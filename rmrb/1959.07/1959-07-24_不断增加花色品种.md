    Continuously Increasing Variety
    Speaking of variety, some may think it's a small matter. As long as production quantity and total production value are completed, the task is done. Whether there are more or fewer varieties doesn't matter much. In fact, this is a one-sided view.
    People's needs in life are diverse; men, women, old and young, have different needs. Take scissors for example. If we only produce one type of scissors, regardless of whether we are cutting clothes, trimming nails, performing surgery, or cutting hair, would that work? Definitely not. Moreover, people's preferences are not exactly the same. Some people like to wear floral fabrics, while others prefer simple and elegant clothes, which cannot be forced. Therefore, while continuously improving the output and quality of daily necessities, the industrial departments that produce them must also treat increasing variety and satisfying people's diverse needs as much as possible as a very important task, and not treat it carelessly.
    In recent years, the production departments of daily consumer goods have made great achievements in expanding variety. Our daily consumer goods are not only constantly improving in quality, but also have increased more in variety than in the past. However, with the continuous improvement of people's living standards, people's demand for variety is also constantly changing. Some varieties that were liked by people in the past may not be liked by people now. If we are only satisfied with the existing varieties, we will inevitably gradually become unwelcome to the masses. The Shanghai Jiuxin Enamel Factory produced many new styles of washbasins that were popular with the masses last year, but they lagged behind in an industry-wide evaluation at the beginning of this year. Why? The reason is very simple: they did not pay attention to the changes in people's needs and did not attach enough importance to increasing new varieties.
    Some personnel in factories and enterprises worry that increasing variety will bring some trouble to production management, and worry that doing so will not allow them to complete the production plan. This view is also not comprehensive. The basic purpose of production is to meet people's needs. A factory or enterprise producing more varieties that meet the needs of the people can not only make people live satisfactorily, but also, because the masses like these products, they will use them carefully and cherish them. Thus, these things can be fully and rationally used, and even the life of some things can be extended. If we still produce those outdated and old-fashioned varieties, even if the factory or enterprise completes the production task, these things will not be liked by the masses, and they may even buy them and not want to use them. This is in fact a waste of social resources. How can this be considered completing the production task and meeting the needs of the people? What's more, producing these outdated products that are not liked by the masses is also disgraceful for a factory or enterprise.
    Of course, multi-variety production is more troublesome than single-variety production, but as long as we always think about the needs of consumers, listen carefully to their opinions, and rely on the broad masses of employees, there will be no great troubles and difficulties. The Jiuxin Enamel Factory saw this clearly and did so, and finally created many new varieties. The factory's products were once again welcomed by consumers. This is called man makes the matter; if you are really determined to create conditions, the variety can be increased.
    Expanding the variety of daily necessities is a matter for the production departments, but it is not entirely a matter for the production departments. Commercial departments, science departments, art design departments, and the broad masses of consumers all have an obligation to give strong support to the production departments. Only with support and cooperation from all aspects can we make the variety of daily consumer goods increasingly rich and colorful, and better meet the living needs of the broad masses of people.

    不断增加花色品种
    提起花色品种，也许有人觉得这是一件小事，只要生产数量和生产总值完成了，任务也就完成了。花色品种多一样少一样，没啥关系。其实，这是一种片面的认识。
    人们生活的需要是多种多样的，男女老少，需要各有不同；拿剪刀来说吧，如果我们不管是裁衣服还是剪指甲，也不管是外科开刀还是剪头发，只生产一种剪刀行不行呢？一定不行。而且人们的爱好还不尽一样，有人喜欢穿花布，有人喜欢素雅的衣服，这也不能勉强。因此，生产日用品的工业部门在不断提高产量和质量的同时，还必须把增加花色品种，尽可能地满足人们多种多样的需要，当作一件十分重要的工作来作，不能马马虎虎地对待它。
    最近几年来，日用工业品的生产部门在扩大花色品种方面是有很大成绩的。我们的日用工业品不但质量在不断提高，而且在花色品种上也比过去增加得多了。但是随着人民生活水平的不断提高，人们对花色品种的需求也是在不断发生变化的，有些过去为人们喜欢的花色品种，现在却不一定是人们喜欢的了。如果我们仅仅满足已经有的花色品种，那就势必逐渐地不为群众所欢迎。上海久新搪瓷厂去年生产了不少受群众欢迎的新花色的面盆，可是在今年年初的一次全行业评比中，他们却落后了。为什么？原因很简单，他们没有注意到人们需要的变化，对增加新的花色品种重视不够。
    有些工厂、企业的人员担心增加花色品种，会给生产管理上带来一些麻烦，担心这样做了，会完不成生产计划。这种看法也是不全面的。生产的基本目的是为了满足人们的需要，一个工厂、一个企业多生产适合人民群众需要的花色品种，不仅可以使人民生活得满意，而且由于群众喜爱这些产品，他们就会经心地使用它，爱惜它，因而就可以使这些东西得到充分合理的使用，甚至可以延长一些东西的寿命。如果仍然生产那些过了时的、老一套的花色品种，尽管这个工厂或企业完成了生产任务，但是由于这些东西不为群众所喜爱，甚至买了去不愿使用它；这事实上就是一种社会物力的浪费，这又怎么能算完成了生产任务、满足了人民的需要呢？更何况生产这些陈旧的不为群众喜爱的产品，对一个工厂、一个企业来说也是不光彩的。
    当然，多品种生产和单一品种生产比起来，是麻烦一些，但是只要我们处处为消费者需要着想，认真听取他们的意见，并且依靠广大职工群众，也不会有什么了不起的麻烦和困难。久新搪瓷厂看清楚了这一点，而且这样做了，终于创造了许多新的花色品种，这个厂的产品重新受到了消费者的欢迎。这叫做事在人为，真正下决心去创造条件，花色品种就能增加。
    扩大日用品的花色品种，这是生产部门的事，但又不完全是生产部门的事。商业部门、科学部门、美术设计部门、广大消费群众都有义务给生产部门以大力支持。只有多方面给生产部门以支持和协作，我们才能使日用工业品的花色品种日益丰富多彩，才能更好地满足广大人民的生活需要。
