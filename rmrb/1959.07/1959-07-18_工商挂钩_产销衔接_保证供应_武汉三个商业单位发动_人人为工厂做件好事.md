    Industry and Commerce Linked, Production and Sales Connected, Supply Guaranteed
    Three Commercial Units in Wuhan Launch "Everyone Doing a Good Deed for the Factory"

    (Reported by our newspaper) Wuhan Department Store Wholesale Station, Hardware and Electrical Appliances Company, and Sports and Entertainment Instrument Wholesale Store, in conjunction with relevant factories, have organized an industrial and commercial collaboration competition, which has achieved significant results in "promoting production and ensuring supply."

    At the beginning of this year, Wuhan Department Store Station put forward the slogan "Walk all over the three towns of Wuhan, ask all the factories in the city," and mobilized employees to conduct a general visit to factories throughout the city. At that time, it was found that there were more than 480 factories producing daily necessities, and many products, such as cloth-covered rubber shoes and bamboo shells for thermos bottles, which they previously thought Wuhan could not produce, were discovered. Immediately, more than 10 million yuan worth of production and sales contracts were signed with these factories. The Sports and Stationery Wholesale Store also found several factories that could manufacture air gun bullets, shotguns, and refurbished typewriters, and signed production and sales contracts. The scale of the Hardware and Electrical Appliances Company was even larger. In two visits, they signed production and sales contracts worth more than 180 million yuan, which was six times more than the total amount of processing and ordering in the city last year. The product variety also increased from 225 to 596. On the basis of industrial and commercial linkage, they also disaggregated the commercial purchase plan and the factory production plan on a quarterly and monthly basis, and launched an industrial and commercial collaboration competition, in order to guide production with planning and ensure market supply. In the collaboration competition, these three commercial units sent resident factory staff to report the production situation and market needs to the leaders of both parties at any time. The biggest problem encountered in the collaboration competition was that the raw materials, equipment, and technical conditions of many factories could not keep up with the needs of production. These three units separately launched mass movements of "everyone doing a good deed for the factory" and "everyone making contributions for the factory," making full use of the commercial sector's many social connections to help factories overcome difficulties. The Department Store Station organized the Wuhan Cotton Weaving Factory to help the Heping Knitting Factory solve the problem of dyeing tools, enabling the Heping Knitting Factory to produce women's stretch shirts, which Wuhan had never produced before, and were very popular in the market. The Hardware and Electrical Appliances Company saw that the quality of the pens produced by the Minquan Steel Pen Factory was poor and sales were sluggish, while the market lacked test pens, so they helped the factory find steel molds and other equipment to switch to producing test pens, producing 4,000 dozen at a time, which solved the problem of the factory's working capital backlog and ensured market supply.

    The commercial sector also widely carried out the work of "selling what is collected" in waste product recycling to help factories overcome raw material difficulties. The Sports and Stationery Store allocated more than 10,000 used film boxes for photography from the recycled waste products at one time, solving the one-month aluminum consumption of the Wuhan Musical Instrument Factory in the production of accordions. The waste products recycled by the Department Store Station from January to May were worth more than 260,000 yuan, and the raw materials found for the factory amounted to 2.6 million yuan.

    At the same time, the factories also actively tried to expand the variety of products to meet market needs. The Wuhan Cultural and Sports Factory and the Musical Instrument Factory trial-produced 24 new products, such as violins, three-purpose tracing tables, travel organs, and external shooting machines, in two months, and restored the production of small commodities such as abacuses and iron dumbbells.

### 工商挂钩　产销衔接　保证供应  武汉三个商业单位发动“人人为工厂做件好事”

    工商挂钩　产销衔接　保证供应
    武汉三个商业单位发动“人人为工厂做件好事”
    本报讯　武汉百货批发站、五金交电公司、体育文娱仪器批发商店同有关工厂组织的工商协作竞赛，已在“促进生产，保证供应”上取得显著成绩。
    今年年初，武汉百货站就提出
  “走遍武汉三镇，问尽全市工厂”的口号，发动职工对全市工厂进行普遍访问，当时就查出生产日用百货的工厂四百八十多个，查出他们过去以为武汉市不能生产的布胶鞋、水瓶竹壳等产品多种，立即同这些工厂签订了一千多万元的产销合同。体育文具批发商店也查出能制造汽枪子弹、鸟枪和翻新打字机的工厂多家，并且签订了产销合同。五金交电公司的规模更大，他们在两次访问中，便签订了一亿八千多万元的产销合同，比去年全年在本市加工订货的总数还多六倍；产品品种也由二百二十五种增为五百九十六种。他们又在工商挂钩的基础上，分季、分月地将商业购进计划与工厂生产计划卸接起来，展开工商协作竞赛，以做到用计划指导生产，保证市场供应。在协作竞赛中，这三个商业单位都派了驻厂员，随时向双方领导上汇报生产情况和市场需要情况。协作竞赛中遇到的最大问题，是许多工厂原料、设备和技术条件跟不上生产的需要。这三个单位都分别开展了“人人为工厂做件好事”、“人人为工厂立功”的群众运动，充分利用商业部门社会联系多的特点，帮助工厂克服困难。百货站就组织武汉棉织厂帮助和平针织厂解决染色工具问题，使和平针织厂生产出武汉市从未生产过的女式弹力衫，在市场上深受欢迎。五金交电公司见民权钢笔厂生产的钢笔质量差，销路滞，而市场却缺少试电笔，就帮助这个工厂找到钢模型等设备，转为生产试电笔，一次就生产出四千打，既解决了本厂流动资金积压的问题，又保证了市场供应。
    商业部门还普遍开展“卖啥收啥”的废品回收工作，帮助工厂克服原材料困难。体育文具商店就从回收的废品中一次拨出一万多个照相用的胶卷废盒，解决了武汉乐器厂生产手风琴的一个月用铝量。百货站1至5月回收的废品就价值二十六万多元，帮助工厂找寻的原料材料达二百六十万元。
    与此同时，各工厂也都积极设法扩大品种，满足市场需要。武汉文体厂和乐器厂在两个月内就试制出小提琴、三用透图台、旅行风琴、外拍机等二十四种新产品，并恢复了算盘、铁哑铃等小商品的生产。
