    Adapting to Conquer
    Wang Chaowen

    I
    Creation is the object of appreciation, and appreciation is the purpose of creation. The need for appreciation prospers creation, and creation creates the need for appreciation. Increased creation raises the level of appreciation, and an increased level of appreciation promotes the improvement of creation. This is the dialectical relationship between appreciation and creation, the unity of opposites between the giver and the receiver.

    Generally speaking, creation is not for self-intoxication, but to satisfy others, thereby exerting the role of art on the ideological front. The situation of Lingguan painting a rose is special. Including lyric poetry, whether or not one is conscious of the needs of the appreciator during creation, all considerations of content and form cannot be explained without it. When a poet revises a draft, his identity is that of the author who is creating, and also the first reader of the work. With this "he" making things difficult for himself, the quality of the work has an extra layer of guarantee.

    The role of art is propaganda, but whether people are willing to accept propaganda depends first on whether the images in the work can move them. Emotion cannot be forced; the emotion that appears forced is a great distance from genuine emotion. In order to conquer the service object of art, one must adapt to the object of art's service.

    The propaganda of realistic art is based on the true reflection of reality. Therefore, propaganda is guiding the people to deeply understand reality. The content of art, that is, what to use to educate the people, what to use to serve socialist construction, is the fundamental issue in artistic creation. But how to do the work better must be considered in conjunction with the service object.

    The relationship between the artist who guides the people to understand reality and the service object is a bit like the relationship between a tour guide and a tourist. Tour guides also have different levels. Is it to appropriately inspire people to conduct corresponding explorations themselves, thereby understanding life, or is it to appear enthusiastic, gesticulating everywhere, pouring what he knows to the other party? This depends on whether the giver has an appropriate estimate of the needs, interests, and abilities of the receiver. The reason why ostentatious and affected performances are annoying is that they hinder the audience's appreciation activities, forcing them to accept those meaningless stimuli, making it difficult to enter the realm that the drama should provide.

    Adapting to the service object is not the purpose of art, but in order to conquer the object, one must adapt to their needs and even interests. Why is it that content that is correct but too straightforward and detailed cannot move people, and why is it that sometimes words with a questioning tone are more inflammatory? These cannot be explained without understanding the psychological characteristics of the audience.

    In traditional art, there is a method of advancing by retreating, similar to a tactic. Actors who have inherited the performance experience of their predecessors and are good at controlling the audience sometimes use the method of loosening before tightening, and suppressing before promoting (Note 1). When the audience is attracted by accidental stimuli from the surroundings and no longer concentrates on listening to the cross-talk, in order to re-attract the audience to the cross-talk, they deliberately say something related to the accidental phenomenon that has just appeared, arousing laughter from the audience, making the audience care about the cross-talk actor who made them laugh, and then continue the main topic of the cross-talk (Note 2). In terms of its power, the phenomenon of advancing by retreating and suppressing before promoting, which is related to people's mental activities, conforms to the laws of motion of things. Lenin said: "To retreat in order to leap forward better."

    II
    Art appreciation is not simply acceptance, but a thinking activity. Whether intentional or unintentional (usually unintentional), appreciation activity is also an imaginative activity. The painting theory that "the more hidden the scenery, the greater the realm; the more exposed the scenery, the smaller the realm" is reasonable because it is connected to the role of the appreciator. When people approach art, they always rely on imagination to delve into the established artistic image.

    Without imagination, there is no artistic creation, and without imagination, there is no art appreciation. Without imagination, it is impossible to understand the content of national instrumental music such as "Ambush from Ten Sides," "Wild Geese Descending on the Sandbank," or "Embroidered Purse." Recognizing artistic images is also based on the direct and indirect life experiences of the appreciator. Readers who have never been on a boat or have not experienced being on a boat will find it more difficult to appreciate the beauty of moving verses such as "Green peaks on both banks emerge facing each other" or "Boatmen's night talk makes one aware of the rising tide." Children who have no knowledge of life in the old society inevitably fail to appreciate the profound social significance when reading Lu Xun's famous work "Diary of a Madman." Because the imaginations of appreciators are varied, the impressions of the same artistic image in people's minds also differ. But the role of imagination in appreciation is undeniable. It is difficult to find a child who has fought a tiger; but the storytelling "Wu Song Fights the Tiger" can make thousands of children listen with fascination. Is this only because the storyteller's skills are superb? Not entirely. The reason why a skilled storyteller is skilled is that he can broadly evoke the listener's image memory and emotional memory, allowing people to rely on even very limited life experiences to experience a life of fighting tigers that they have never experienced themselves, thereby "participating" in the "creation" activity of the artistic image of fighting the tiger and becoming a "cooperator" in the creation. Late at night, children listening to stories in teahouses and unwilling to go home put aside the possible reproaches from parents and teachers, and share the joys and sorrows with Wu Song, almost like actors who have not appeared on stage but have entered the role. The mental labor of the appreciator is an important reason why artistic images can see the big in the small, achieve more with less, and extend from this to that.

    Artworks are objective existences that do not change with the differences of appreciators. Appreciators cannot directly transform established artworks. Anyone who adds a stroke or two to an ancient painting in an exhibition hall may become a criminal who destroys cultural relics. However, appreciators inevitably use their own life experiences or appreciation experiences to "enrich" or "expand" artistic images, and this is a good thing. The admiring applause when watching a play is like reciting poetry without regard to others, not only intoxicated by the beauty of the form, but also further recognizing the characteristics of the image, and even deeply understanding the thoughts it includes. Classical art whose themes and current reality are completely different.

    A deep understanding of the ideological content of a work is based on the digestion of images during acceptance. The "re-creation" of the image is also a deep understanding of the life reflected by the image. The appreciator relies on imagination to "enrich" the artistic image, and at the same time strengthens his understanding of the meaning contained in the image. How to organize appreciators into the "creation" activity of the image is a matter of skill; whether the appreciator can exert corresponding imagination to "enrich" the image and "expand" the image is also related to the strength of ideological power and the height of propaganda effect. Naturalistic works hinder the imaginative activities of appreciators, and conceptualized works do not provide corresponding clues for imaginative activities for appreciators. The former does not leave room for "re-creation," and the latter lacks the guidance for "creating" something. Precisely because the process of the appreciator accepting propaganda is also the process of indirectly understanding reality, therefore, fables and other linguistic arts, although they touch on major issues of beauty, ugliness, good and evil, use sentences that are as concise as possible, and the way of embodying the content is also very implicit, they are still understandable and popular. For example, why can operas such as "Fifteen Strings of Cash," "Eight Righteous Men," "Sun An Submits a Memorial," and even "Blue Bridge Meeting" or "Ten Friends Guessing" produce a positive effect on the spirit of revolutionaries? On the one hand, it is because of the universality of their content, and on the other hand, it is because the eyesight of the new audience is more discerning than that of the old era, and they can see its universal significance through specific phenomena. If the exploration of the reader or listener is not taken into account, many issues related to skills have no standards, and the role of art on the ideological front is difficult to imagine.

    III
    The fan, as a prop for dance and performance, provides actors with a broad freedom of creation. Sometimes, it is equivalent to a wall. Actors can use it to "isolate" the roles on the same stage and confide in the audience alone. However, without the audience's imagination, all of this is meaningless. The subtext in theatrical performances, such as Katerina in the drama "The Thunderstorm," who is encouraged by her sister to have a secret meeting with her lover, and has complex feelings of both wanting happiness and not wanting to commit a crime, may be "spoken" through actions such as the key seeming hot when she accepts it. Whether the actor's actions can "speak" depends on how cultivated they are. Whether the audience understands what the actor's actions are "saying" depends on whether the audience has entered the realm of the play. A truly cultivated actor is good at using performance to evoke the audience's imagination and explore the subtext of the performance. Separating life as the standard for examining art from the appreciator alone makes it impossible to understand the techniques of suggestion, metaphor, and symbolism in art. The film montage technique, which is good at controlling the audience's attention, actually adapts to the objective laws of how people's attention shifts. The use of percussion instruments in opera, which is not good at realistically imitating natural forms but is rich in suggestiveness, just like the role of architectural shapes in people's spirits, can it be separated from the associations and imagination of the appreciator?

    With the "cooperation" of the service object, artistic creation has great freedom. Opera often uses ways that are not quite the same as life phenomena to reflect life. Phenomena that appear in the same space, such as sound and action, can be completed in performance not at once, but separately. "Drew the Green Edge Sword from his waist," is a line from Luo Cheng in the Huiju Opera "Mud River." Singing, as the psychological state when drawing the sword, in terms of actual life, it and the character's action of drawing the sword originally appear at the same time. But the actor separates them. After singing the first half of the sentence, "Drew the Green Edge from his waist", he draws the sword, and then sings the second half of the sentence "Green Edge Sword". The actor separately explains the singing and the action to the audience, but the audience comprehensively accepts it, forming a complete image. Similar phenomena are very common in traditional opera. The "effect" closely related to the lyrics should appear at the same time as the performance but does not appear at the same time. "Hearing the third watch drum after the watchtower has finished playing," there are those who beat first and then sing, and those who sing first and then beat, and what is common is beating interspersed with singing.

    Traditional art expresses phenomena that do not appear in the same space at the same time, sometimes compressing them into one space. The so-called "banana trees in the snow" is something we have no opportunity to see. The "Night Revels of Han Xizai" currently in the Palace Museum belongs to this type of work. Opera also uses this method. In the Huiju Opera "Three Blocks," as soon as Qin Qiong raises his steel whip, the enemy several feet away falls to the ground. This is similar to what Huang Tingjian recorded about Li Gonglin's works. In the painting, Li Guang is pulling his bow full to shoot the Hu people; the arrow is still on the bowstring, and the horses and soldiers fleeing in front respond to the string. It is also like the special technique in movies called montage sentences, which can be understood and is conducive to strongly expressing special content. Isn't the power of the role being praised—Qin Qiong or Li Guang—gaining a kind of (I only say a kind of) powerful form here?

    There are many phenomena in traditional art that cannot be judged for their merits and demerits without the imagination and even thinking of the appreciator. Yang Guang in the Sichuan Opera "Yang Guang Forces the Palace" rolls on the ground after the royal seal is in his hands. Xu Jia in "Kneeling to Eat Grass" jumps up when he kneels in front of the prime minister's mansion. Just as good people can be played by clowns or use clown masks, in connection with the performances before and after, the audience may realize that Yang Guang rolling on the ground is an image of the crazy psychology of someone who wants to be emperor; Xu Jia jumping up to kneel is an exaggerated description of the despicable psychology of a person who is at a disadvantage and eager to save himself.

    The opera art, which is good at substituting the virtual for the real and seeing the real in the virtual, often does not rely on large props and sets, and the environment of the characters' actions is brought out by the actors' performance. Modern stage equipment, such as the use of electric lights, cannot replace the superiority of traditional opera performance art. There is no horse on the stage, but the characteristics of the horse's slipping, jumping around, and refusing to move can be expressed by relying on the various dances of the horse boy who has a close relationship with the horse in life; moreover, what the audience wants to see is the dance, not a real horse. It is not difficult to hang many lanterns on the stage to create a set for "Husband and Wife Watching Lanterns". It is not easy to rely on actors to make people feel that they are acting between various lanterns. It is not difficult to use dark lights for terrifying plots and strong lights for joyful plots, just as it is not difficult to use slow rhythms for music expressing sadness and fast rhythms for passion, and to use upward-looking shots for solemn objects and downward-looking shots for humble objects in photography, there are examples to follow. However, it is not easy to rely on performances that focus on shaping typical characters to create a specific atmosphere and to use dance to express an invisible environment. Han Opera actor Li Luoke's wading in "Double Down the Mountain" and Sichuan Opera actor Yuan Yukun's blowing on his frozen hands in "Welcoming Auspicious Store," just like the sailing in "Autumn River," are good because they substitute the virtual for the real and there is reality in the virtual. They not only shaped the characters effortlessly (this is the main thing), but also expressed the environment in which they acted. If you think that these performances that may create a sense of reality in the environment are not thorough enough, and you must move real objects onto the stage, the result is bound to hinder the dance, and "Autumn River," which is good at dance, may no longer be "Autumn River."

    Traditional art shapes images, often focusing not on the subject itself, but on the environment in which it is located and the influence of its actions. Landscape paintings with people as the subject can not only paint people very small, but can also not directly paint people ("Seeing the Dan Well is like meeting a feathered guest, and looking at the pagoda is knowing a reclusive high monk"). "Pipa Ballad" is a poem, it cannot directly create auditory images like music itself. By using metaphors and focusing on describing the impact of music on people's spirits, it indirectly provides auditory images to the reader. Talented storytellers understand the characteristics of linguistic art and do not cling to objects that cannot be grasped, such as ghosts. Saying that ghosts use descriptions such as "mouth like a blood basin, eyes like copper bells," which seem real but are actually superficial, is not so terrifying. On the contrary, focusing on describing the environment in which the ghost will appear, focusing on describing the impact of the ghost on the characters in the work, the storyteller does not appear to be deliberately trying to scare people at all, but the person listening to the story may be invaded by terror. Why does this way of expression, which does not focus on describing the subject but focuses on the environment and influence, also attract listeners, sometimes even more able to attract listeners? Just like watching a play, because the life experience of the person listening to the story becomes the basis for imagination. Of course, ghosts are not objective existences, and life experiences of dealing with ghosts are hard to find in the world. However, the eerie atmosphere formed by the unpredictable environment, unexpected stimuli, such as the frightening cry of an owl in the middle of the night, and various related and similar sensory experiences, may become factors in "enriching" the image when listening to the story.

    Opera actors pay great attention to the ease of performance. The so-called ease, I think, is not only to entertain the audience and avoid unpleasant stimuli, but also to make it easier for the audience to accept the content that should be accepted. For example, when shaping the image of a hero, they often explain it gradually and calmly, and do not rush to reveal everything all at once. It is like a long scroll of Chinese landscape painting, composed of parts to form a whole, adapting to the audience's appreciation psychology and avoiding unnecessary stimuli. Some cartoons that are difficult to be funny, some expressions that are difficult to be pleasant, some arts and crafts that are difficult to look good, and some second curtains that reduce unnecessary stimuli for the audience but instead strengthen unnecessary stimuli, are not very popular, partly because they are not easy, but also because they hinder the "re-creative" imagination activities of appreciation.

    IV
    Emphasizing adapting to the imagination of the appreciator does not mean that the artistic image can be untrue or incomplete. If the waterfall in the painting is as limp as a cloth strip hanging on a frame, the person watching the painting will not "hear" the sound of the water crashing. If the flowers in the painting are as dry and stiff as paper flowers, the person watching the painting will not "smell" the rich fragrance of the flowers. If the marble sculpture explains the human body's organization but lacks the texture of the flesh, the person touching the sculpture will not feel that it "has" body temperature. This spring, after passing through the Three Gorges, the captain pointed out the Goddess Peak to us. The goddess, whose figure is a bit similar to the pottery figurines of the late Tang Dynasty, beside the rocks in the mountains, among the flowing clouds, the more you look at it, the more you believe that the fantasies of the predecessors have a basis. Some people say it is a pity that they cannot go closer to see it, but I think that going closer to see it may be a pity for the impression already gained. Because the so-called goddess is actually just a rough, irregular stone. The objective determines the subjective; the stone looks a bit like a beautiful woman, and the name Goddess can only circulate. If someone wants to overturn the case and call this stone Lion Peak or another peak, it will not expand the impact.

    It is not easy to shape realistic artistic images, and it seems even more difficult to ignite the flame of the service object's imagination, so that they can better understand the theme of the work and further understand life. The imagination needed for art appreciation should not be boundless and unlimited. The reason why a typical character is important is that it can both evoke imagination and control imagination. If the imagination has no scope and direction, the combativeness of art is bound to fail.

    Imagination is evoked by concrete images. What kind of imagination is evoked depends on what kind of stimuli are received. Many of Qi Baishi's works, which win not only with images but also with artistic conception, such as a broken palm-leaf fan and a lotus pod that has been peeled and eaten, just like another work of his (painting a plate of cherries, not full, as if someone had moved them, and there are a few cherries scattered outside the plate), specify the scope of imagination for the audience. It makes people clearly feel the change of seasons when they see such things, and think of people who do not directly appear on the screen. The work dominates appreciation; the same is true for nude sculptures, whether they arouse noble emotions or are infected by low tastes, the effects are very different. Imagination is stimulated by images, and it is also controlled by images. The same is true for fish, when they appear in Song Dynasty paintings "Group of Fish Playing in Algae" and in some paintings by Bada Shanren and Qi Baishi, and when they appear on the fishing line of a fisherman, on a grass stem, and on a cook's cutting board, they give people very different impressions. Fish painted in water can make people think of agility, freedom, and happiness, while fish hanging on a grass stem or placed on a cutting board will arouse completely opposite feelings. Artists who understand the service object of art, in order to strengthen necessary stimuli and avoid unnecessary stimuli, are unwilling to treat the materials of creation naturalistically. The "Picking Flowers" in Fujian Liyuan Opera, which is matched with the action of picking flowers, is the sound of the percussion instrument, the horse gong. Pick one, and the crisp horse gong rings once. Just like the Sichuan Opera "Picking Red Plums," which uses the side sound of the big gong ("cang cang cang") to describe flying flowers, it is not restricted by natural phenomena, but uses exaggerated and even virtual ways to strengthen stimuli and evoke corresponding imagination. In contrast, in order to avoid forming unnecessary stimuli and to avoid hindering necessary associations and imaginations, playwrights are not afraid that people will blame his descriptions for being inadequate, and insist on sleeping instead of actually sleeping, not actually hitting when hitting someone, embracing at a very distant distance, not actually eating or drinking when drinking and eating, and not showing grief by crying with tears all over their faces... avoiding many unnecessary specifics and realism.

    Only realistic images can appropriately specify the scope and direction of imagination, but it depends on where it is specific and how specific it is. In the Kunqu Opera "Fisherman's Joy," Liu Suan, who is about to flee for his life, is hindered by the Yangtze River and is in trouble. The lyrics say, "Look at the waves soaring to the sky, you can't see the sails. Only turning on the river, doing the flute-blowing Wu Zixu to bear sorrow, how can you suddenly pity the people in the reeds!" When the actor sings "You can't see the sails," what dance should be matched to be more realistic and bring the audience into the play and share the joys and sorrows with the characters? Some may be to spread their hands or even wave their hands, translating the word "not" into action. Some may be a completely different way, insisting on looking when singing "You can't see," looking even more urgently, which makes the character's mood more deeply expressed, so the imagination it evokes is wider.

    The appreciator's imaginative activities are inseparable from his personal education, experience, personality, and preferences, but there is always a common law. Artists must understand it in order to create realistic and moving images. The props in opera are dead things, but also living things. They can form a broad realm and lead people into major issues of right and wrong, good and evil, or they can make people think that they are just props. Some things that symbolize the fate of the characters, such as the key that Katerina just got, the letter of divorce that Jiao Guiying unexpectedly received, and the gauze hat in the hands of Zhou Ren, who was oppressed, symbolizing the authority of the oppressor, can have rich content in the eyes of a cultivated actor. However, if it appears in the hands of an actor who does not care about the reality of life and does not care about the needs of the audience, these real objects, which originally contained rich content, may become a burden, if the actor is afraid that the audience does not understand the meaning it contains, and desperately acts on it, it may turn a good thing into a bad thing. The actor makes too many explanations on it, such as staring at it, and the result is just forcing the audience to pay special attention to these real objects themselves. Not only can it not lead the audience into the broad realm of major issues of right and wrong, good and evil, but it will also make people feel the falseness and ridiculousness of the performance.

    According to my personal limited appreciation experience, I always hope that artists will give us more opportunities to accept the content of the work. Where there is a painting, it may become a redundant element, and where there is no painting, it may become a wonderful realm, depending on its effect on the audience's spirit. Landscapes without characters may be tempting, and landscapes full of tourists may not be able to evoke interest in traveling. The arrangement of the virtual and real in the composition should take the audience's response into account. If one is afraid that the theme that scenic spots belong to the people is not clear, the documentary, which should have focused on the scenery, inserts people everywhere, sometimes inevitably hindering the audience's imagination and weakening the in-depth appreciation of the scenic spots. If the artist treats the audience sitting in front of the screen as "tourists" who have not entered nature physically but may enter nature spiritually, there will be fewer concerns. How to adapt to the appreciator's problem is one aspect of the problem of how to implement the literary and artistic policy of serving the people. Whether it is to meet the people's aesthetic requirements or to educate the people with communist ideology, to conquer the service object, one must study how to adapt to the service object.

    Note ①: Magic is most afraid of revealing tricks. However, magicians often expose the secrets of magic, so that the audience understands some of the secrets of magic, seemingly to weaken the charm of magic, but actually to further arouse greater surprise.

    适应为了征服
    王朝闻
    一
    创作是欣赏的对象，欣赏是创作的目的。欣赏的需要繁荣了创作，创作创造着欣赏的需要。提高了的创作提高欣赏水平，提高了的欣赏水平促使创作的提高。这是欣赏与创作的辩证关系，这是授者与受者的矛盾的统一。
    一般地说，创作不是为了陶醉自己，同时为了满足别人，从而发挥艺术在思想战线上的作用，龄官画蔷那样的情况是特殊的。包括抒情诗在内，不论创作时意识不意识欣赏者的需要，一切有关内容和形式的推敲，离开它就无从解释，诗人修改草稿的时候，他的身份，是正在创造的作者，也是作品的第一个读者。有了这个他在跟自己为难，作品的质量就多了一层保证。
    艺术的作用是宣传，可是人们愿不愿意接受宣传，首先要看作品中的形象能不能使他感动。感动不能勉强；勉强显得感动的感动，和真正的感动之间有很大的距离。为了征服艺术的服务对象，必须适应艺术服务的对象。
    现实主义的艺术的宣传，是以现实的真实反映为基础。所以宣传就是引导人民深刻认识现实。艺术的内容，也就是说用什么来教育人民，拿什么来为社会主义建设服务，是艺术创作中的根本问题。可是如何把工作做得更好，必须结合着服务对象来考虑如何服务。
    引导人民认识现实的艺术家与服务对象的关系，有点像导游与游人的关系。导游也有水平高低之分。是恰好启发人们自己进行相应的探索，从而了解生活呢，还是为了显得热心，到处指手划脚，把他所知道的浇给对方呢？这要看授者对于受者的需要、兴趣和能力有没有适当的估计。虚张声势、矫揉造作的表演，其所以令人生厌，也在于它妨碍观众的欣赏活动，不得不接受那些无谓的刺激，难得进入戏剧应该提供的境界。
    适应服务对象不是艺术的目的，可是为了征服对象必须和他们的需要以至兴趣相适应。为什么内容正确可是说得太直率太详尽不能感动人，为什么有时带有疑问语气的话反而更有煽动性，离开了听众的心理特征就无从解释。
    在传统艺术里，有一种近似战术的以退为进的方法。继承了前辈的表演经验，善于控制观众的演员，有时要用魔术家先松后紧、欲扬先抑的方式（注1）。当听众被周围偶然的刺激所吸引，不再集中注意听相声的时候，为了把听众重新吸引到相声里来，故意说一些与刚刚出现的偶然现象有关的话，激起听众的笑声，使听众关心逗他们笑了的相声演员，然后才继续相声的本题（注2）。以退为进、欲扬先抑的这些与人们的精神活动相关的现象，就它的力量而论，这是符合事物的运动规律的，列宁说：“为了更好的一跃而后退”。
    二
    艺术欣赏不是单纯的接受，而是一种思维活动。不论是有意是无意（通常是无意的），欣赏活动同时也是一种想像活动。“景愈藏，境界愈大；景愈露，境界愈小”的画论，其所以合理，是联系了欣赏者的作用来说的。人们在接近艺术的时候，总是借助于想像，从而深入到既成的艺术形象中来。
    没有想像就没有艺术的创造，没有想像也就没有艺术的欣赏。没有想像，要体会民族器乐例如“十面埋伏”、“平沙落雁”或“绣荷包”的内容是不可能的。认识艺术形象也是以欣赏者的直接的和间接的生活经验为依据的。不曾坐过船或没有体会过坐船的经验的读者，要体会动人的诗句例如“两岸青峰相对出”或“舟人夜语觉潮生”的好处就比较困难。没有旧社会的生活知识的孩子，读起鲁迅名作“狂人日记”来，难免辜负它那深远的社会意义。因为欣赏者的想像是千差万别的，所以同一艺术形象在人们心目中的印象也有区别。可是想像之于欣赏的作用，是无可怀疑的。和老虎打过架的小孩，世间难找；评书“武松打虎”却可能使千千万万个小孩听得入迷。这只因为说书人的技巧高明吗？不完全是。高明的说书人，其所以高明，也在于能够广泛地唤起听者的形象记忆和情绪记忆，让人们依靠那怕是很有限的生活经验，体验打虎这种他自己根本没有经历过的生活，从而“参加”到打虎这一艺术形象的“创造”活动中来，成为创作的“合作者”。深夜，在茶馆里听书不愿回家的孩子，把可能遇到的家长和老师的责罚置之度外，在那里与武松共忧乐，近似没有出场而又进入了角色的演员。欣赏者的脑力劳动，就是艺术形象能够以小见大、以少胜多、由此及彼的重要原因。
    艺术品是不随欣赏者的不同而改变的客观存在，欣赏者不能直接改造既成的艺术品。谁要是给展览室里的古画补一两笔，他可能成为破坏文物的罪犯。可是欣赏者总是不可避免地要用他自己的生活经验或欣赏经验来“丰富”或“扩大”艺术形象，而且这是好事。听戏时的击节叹赏，就好比旁若无人地吟诵诗词，不仅仅陶醉于形式的美，也是进一步认识形象的特色，以至深入领会它所包括的思想。题材和当前的现实完全不同的古典艺术。
    作品思想内容的深刻认识，基于接受形象时的消化。形象的“再创造”，也就是深入地认识形象所反映的生活。欣赏者依靠想像“丰富”了艺术形象，同时加强了他对于形象所包含的意义的认识。如何把欣赏者组织到形象的“创造”活动中来，是技巧问题；而欣赏者能不能发挥相应的想像，“丰富”形象和“扩大”形象，却也关系到思想力量的强弱，宣传效果的高低。自然主义的作品妨碍欣赏者的想像活动，概念化的作品没有给欣赏者提供相应的想像活动的线索。前者没有留下“再创造”的余地，后者缺少“创造”什么的诱导。正因为欣赏者接受宣传的过程，同时也就是间接认识现实的过程，所以寓言等等语言艺术，虽然接触了关系美丑善恶等重大意义的问题，用的是尽可能洗练的句子，体现内容的方式也很含蓄，仍然是可以了解和受人欢迎的。例如戏曲“十五贯”、“八义图”、“孙安动本”以至“蓝桥会”或“十朋猜”，为什么能够在革命者的精神上产生积极的作用，一方面因为它们的内容的普遍性，一方面因为新的观众较之旧时代的观众的眼力高明，能够透过具体现象看出它那普遍意义。假如不把读者或听众的探索估计在内，许多有关技巧的问题没有标准，艺术在思想战线上的作用也很难想像。
    三
    扇子，作为一种舞蹈和表演的道具，它给演员提供了广阔的创造的自由。有时，它相当于一堵墙。演员可以用它来把同台的角色“隔离”开，单独向观众交心。可是，离开了观众的想像，这一切都是没有意义的。戏剧表演中的潜台词，例如话剧“大雷雨”里的卡杰林娜受了妹妹的怂恿，要和情人幽会而又有顾虑的复杂心情，既是渴望得到幸福又不愿意犯罪的内心矛盾，可能从她接受钥匙的时候钥匙似乎烫手等等动作“说”出来。演员的动作会不会“说话”，要看修养如何。观众懂不懂演员的动作在“说”些什么，要看观众是不是进入了戏的境界。真正有修养的演员，善于用表演唤起观众的想像，发掘表演的潜台词。离开了欣赏者，单独把生活作为检验艺术的标准，不可能理解艺术中的那些暗示、比喻、象征的手法。善于支配观众的注意力的电影蒙太奇技巧，其实是适应了人们的注意力如何转换的客观规律的。不以如实地模仿自然形态见长、却又富于暗示性的戏曲中的打击乐器的运用，正如建筑的造形在人们精神上的作用，和欣赏者的联想和想像分得开吗？
    有了服务对象的“合作”，艺术创造有了很大的自由。戏曲，常常使用了和生活现象不那么一样的方式来反映生活。同时出现在一个空间的现象，例如声音和动作，表演时可以不一次完成，拆开来交代。“在腰间拔出了青锋剑”，是徽剧“淤泥河”里的罗成的一句唱词。唱，作为拔剑时的心理状态，就实际生活而论，它和人物拔剑的动作本来是同时出现的。可是演员把它们拆开了。唱了上半句“在腰间拔出了”之后，拔剑，再唱下半句“青锋剑”。演员把唱与做分别地向观众交代，观众却综合地把它接受下来，构成完整的形象。在传统的戏曲里类似的现象很普遍。与唱词有密切联系的“效果”，应该与表演同时出现却不同时出现。“听谯楼打罢了三更鼓”，有先打后唱的，有先唱后打的，常见的是唱中夹打的。
    传统艺术表现并非同时出现在一个空间的现象，有时是把它们压缩在一个空间里。所谓“雪里芭蕉”，我们没有机会看见。现藏故宫博物院的“韩熙载夜宴图”，就是属于这一类型的作品。戏曲也运用这种方式。徽剧“三挡”里，秦琼才一扬起钢鞭，和他相距好几尺的敌人就倒地了。这，和黄庭坚所记述的李龙眠的作品相似。画里的李广，拉满了弓要射杀胡人；箭还在弓弦上，前面逃跑的人马就应弦了。也像电影里特殊手法所谓蒙太奇句子那样，是可以懂得的，而且是有利于强烈表现特殊内容的。被歌颂的角色——秦琼或李广的威力，在这儿不是得到了一种（我只说是一种）强有力的形式吗？
    传统艺术中有好些现象，离开了欣赏者的想像以至思考就无法判断它的得失。川剧“杨广逼宫”里的杨广，王印到手以后，在地上打滚。“跪门吃草”里的须贾，相府前下跪时是跳起来跪的。正如好人可由丑角来扮演也可使用丑角脸谱一样，联系着前后的表演，观众可能体会杨广在地上打滚，是在想当皇帝的人的疯狂心理的形象化；须贾跳起来跪，是人物处于劣势而又急于自救的卑鄙心理的夸张的描写。
    善于以虚代实、虚中见实的戏曲艺术，常常不依靠大道具和布景，人物行动的环境依靠演员的表演带出来。现代化的舞台装置，例如电光的利用，还不可能代替传统戏曲表演艺术的优越性。舞台上没有马，可以依靠在生活上和马有密切联系的马童的各种舞蹈，把马的失蹄、乱跳、赖着不走等特点表现出来；何况观众要看的是舞蹈而不是真马。要在舞台上挂出许多灯笼来给“夫妻观灯”作布景，不困难。要靠演员使人感到他们就是行动在各种灯彩之间，不容易。恐怖的情节用暗的灯光，喜悦的情节用强光，正如表现悲哀的音乐用缓慢的节奏，激情用快速的节奏，拍照片遇见庄严的对象用仰视镜头，卑微的对象用俯视镜头，有例可援，不困难。可是，要靠以塑造典型为主的表演来构成特定的气氛，用舞蹈表现无形的环境，不容易。汉剧演员李罗克在“双下山”里的涉水，川剧演员袁玉昆在“迎祥店”里的呵冻，正如“秋江”的行船，好就好在以虚代实，虚中有实。不只不吃力地塑造了人物（这是主要的），同时也表现了他们行动的环境。要是以为这些可能造成环境的实感的表演还不彻底，一定要把实物搬上舞台，其结果难免要妨碍舞蹈，以舞蹈见长的“秋江”，恐怕再也不成其为“秋江”了。
    传统艺术塑造形象，常常不在主体本身着力，而是在所处的环境及其行动的影响上着力。以人为主体的山水画，不只可以把人画得很小，而且可以不直接画出人来（“见丹井而如逢羽客，望浮屠而知隐高僧”）。“琵琶行”是诗，它不能像音乐本身那样直接创造听觉形象。利用了比喻手法和着重描写音乐在人们精神上的影响，间接地向读者提供了听觉形象。有才能的说书演员，明白语言艺术的特长，不死死抓住无法抓住的对象，例如鬼。说鬼如果用“口似血盆、眼似铜铃”等似乎实在其实浮泛的描写，效果不那么可怕。相反，着重描写鬼将出现的环境，着重描写鬼对作品中的人物的精神上的影响，说书的人完全不显得故意要吓人，听故事的人却可能受到恐怖的侵袭。为什么不着重描写主体，而在环境和影响上着力的这种表现方式，也能吸引听众有时更加能够吸引听众呢？正如看戏一样，因为听故事的人的生活经验成为想像的根据。当然，鬼不是客观存在，和鬼打交道的生活经验世间难找。可是莫测的环境所形成的阴森的气氛，意外刺激，例如猫头鹰在深夜的怪叫所造成的惊恐，各种相关的和相似的感性经验，在听故事时可能成为“丰富”形象的因素。
    戏曲演员很讲究表演的轻松。所谓轻松，我以为不只是为了娱乐观众，避免不快的刺激，同时也是为了观众便于接受所应该接受的内容。比如塑造英雄形象，常常从容不迫地逐步交代，不作兴猛一下子都揭出来。好比中国山水画长卷，由局部构成整体，适应了观众欣赏心理，避免了不必要的刺激。有些滑稽得吃力的漫画，有些愉快得吃力的表情，有些好看得吃力的工艺美术品，有些为了减少观众不必要的刺激反而加强了不必要的刺激的二道幕，其所以不太受欢迎，除了不轻松，也因为妨碍欣赏的“再创造”的想像活动。四
    强调适应欣赏者的想像力，并不是说艺术形象可以不真实，不完整。如果画里的瀑布像挂在架上的布条那样软搭搭的，看画的人不会
  “听见”冲击着的水声。如果画里的花朵像纸扎的那样干枯而僵直，看画的人不会“闻见”馥郁的花香。如果大理石的雕像是说明了人体的组织而无肉体的质感，接触雕刻的人不会感到它是“有”体温的。今年春天经过三峡，船长把神女峰指给我们看了。体态有点近似晚唐的陶俑的神女，在山岩旁边，流云之间，越看越相信前人的幻想的有根据。有人说可惜不能近前去看，我以为近前去看可能会可惜已得的印象。因为所谓神女，其实不过是质地粗糙、形式不规则的顽石。客观决定主观；顽石看起来真有点像优美的女性，神女这一名称才能够流传。如果有人想翻案，把这块顽石叫做狮子峰或别的什么峰，不会扩大影响。
    塑造真实的艺术形象不容易，点燃服务对象想像的火焰，使他们更能了解作品的主题和进一步认识生活，似乎更不容易。艺术欣赏所需要的想像，不应当是漫无边际、没有限制的。典型之所以重要，也在于它既能唤起想像，又能控制想像。想像要是没有范围和方向，艺术的战斗性就难免落空。
    想像是具体的形象所唤起的。唤起什么性质的想像，要看受的是什么性质的刺激。不只是以形象取胜而且是以意境取胜的齐白石的许多作品，例如画里一把破了的蒲扇和剥食过了的莲蓬，正如他的另一作品那样（画的是一盘樱桃，没有画满，似乎有谁动过，在盘外还散放了几颗樱桃），给观众规定了想像的范围。它使人们看了这样的一些东西，分明感到季节在变化，想起了没有直接出现在画面上的人。作品支配欣赏；同样是裸体的雕刻，是激起高尚的情绪还是受到低级趣味的感染，作用大不相同。想像是形象刺激起来的，也是形象所控制的。同样是鱼，当它出现在宋画“群鱼戏藻图”和八大山人、齐白石的某些画里的时候，和出现在鱼翁的钓丝上、草干上和厨娘的菜板上的时候，给人的印象大不相同。画在水里的鱼可以使人想到敏捷、自由、高兴，吊在草干上或放在菜板上的鱼却会引起完全相反的感觉。懂得艺术的服务对象的艺术家，为了加强必要的刺激和避免不必要的刺激，不愿意自然主义地对待创作的素材。福建梨园戏的“摘花”，和摘花的动作相配合的，是打击乐器马锣的声音。摘一朵，清脆的马锣响一声。正如川剧“摘红梅”里描写飞花竟自用了大锣（“沧沧沧”的）边音那样，不受自然现象的拘束，用夸张的以至虚拟的方式来加强刺激，唤起相应的想像。和这相反，戏剧家为了避免形成不必要的刺激，避免妨碍必要的联想和想像，也不怕有人怪他的描写不到家，偏偏要以坐代睡，打人不真打，拥抱隔着老远的距离，喝酒吃饭不真吃喝，表现悲哀不作兴哭得满脸眼泪，……避免了许多不必要的具体和逼真。
    只有真实的形象才能够适当规定想象的范围和方向，但要看在什么地方具体，怎样具体。昆曲“渔家乐”里，描写正要逃命的刘蒜被大江拦阻，为难。唱词有“你看波浪腾天，望不见帆樯。只在江上转，做了吹箫伍相担愁怨，怎能蓦地芦中人目怜！”演员唱“望不见帆樯”时，用什么舞蹈相配合才比较真实又比较够能把观众带进戏里，与角色共忧乐呢？有的，可能是摊开双手甚至摆手，为“不”字作动作的翻译。有的，可能是完全不同的方式，在唱“望不见”时偏偏还要望，望得更迫切些，这就使人物的心情表现得更深，因而它所唤起的想像就更宽。
    欣赏者的想像活动和他个人的教养、经历、个性和偏爱分不开，可是总有一个共通的规律。艺术家必须懂得它，才能够创造出真实而又动人的形象。戏曲的道具，是死东西，也是活东西。它可能构成广阔的境界，把人领进关系是非善恶的重大问题之中，也可能使人以为不过是一种道具。有些象征着人物命运的东西，例如卡杰林娜刚刚到手的那一把钥匙，焦桂英出乎意料地接到的那一封催命的休书，受人欺压的周仁手里的那顶象征了压迫者权威的纱帽，在有修养的演员看来，可以有很丰富的内容。可是，如果是出现在不顾生活的真实也不顾观众的需要的演员的手里，本来是寄托了丰富的内容的这些实物，可能成为一种累赘，如果演员唯恐观众不明白它所包含的意义，拼命在上面做戏，可能把好事做成坏事。演员在上面作过多的交代，例如死盯住它，其结果不过是强令观众特别关心这些实物本身。不但是不能把观众领入关系着是非善恶的重大问题的广阔的境界，而且会使人感到表演的虚伪和滑稽。
    按照我个人有限的欣赏经验，总希望艺术家多给我们留下一些便于接受作品内容的机会。有画处可能成为赘疣，无画处可能成为妙境，这要看它在观众精神上的作用。没有出现人物的山水可能是诱人的，画满了游人不见得就能够唤起游兴。构图中的虚实的安排，应该把观众的反应估计在内。如果唯恐名胜是属于人民的这一主题不明确，本来应该以风景为主的纪录片，处处把人安插进去，有时难免妨碍观众的想像，削弱了对于名胜的深入体会。如果艺术家把坐在银幕前的观众当成身体上虽然没有进入自然可是精神可能进入自然的“游人”，顾虑会少得多的。如何适应欣赏者的问题，是如何贯彻为人民服务的文艺方针的问题中的一个方面。不论是为了满足人民的需美要求，是为了用共产主义思想来教育人民，要征服服务对象，必须研究如何适应服务的对象。
