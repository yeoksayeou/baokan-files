Xinhua News Agency Report: Rice is currently in its peak growing season, and is most vulnerable to rice blast. In the past, organic mercury agents such as Ceresan and Semesan were used to prevent this disease. However, the raw materials for producing these drugs often cannot meet the needs of crop prevention. Recently, the Plant Protection Department of the Jiangsu Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences used barium polysulfide to treat 134 rice seedlings, and Ceresan to treat 179 rice seedlings. The test results showed that not a single rice seedling developed the disease. However, in the same environment, out of 244 rice seedlings that were not treated with pesticides, 145 developed the disease.

The method for using barium polysulfide to prevent rice blast is as follows: put barium polysulfide powder into a small amount of cold water (hot water is better), stir to dissolve it, and then add water at a ratio of 1:100; after precipitation, the clear liquid on the top can be used (the sediment at the bottom is poisonous, cannot be used, and must be buried deep in the soil to prevent poisoning of people and animals). For each mu, treat once, using 200 to 300 jin of solution. The prepared solution must be mixed and used immediately; if left for more than a day, it will deteriorate and become ineffective.

    防治稻热病有了新药品
    据新华社讯　目前水稻生长已进入盛期，最怕稻热病为害。防治这种病害，历来都是用西力生和赛力散等有机汞（水银）剂，但是生产这种药物的原料，往往不易满足农作物防治的需要。最近中国科学院江苏分院植物保护系用多硫化钡防治一百三十四株，用赛力散防治一百七十九株，试验结果都没有一株稻苗发生病害。但在同样环境中的没有施用农药的二百四十四株稻苗，却有一百四十五株发生病害。
    多硫化钡防治稻热病的使用方法是：将多硫化钡粉剂放入少量的冷水中（用热水更好），搅拌溶解，然后按一比一百的比例加水；经过沉淀，上层的清液即可使用（下沉的渣滓有毒，不能用，并须深埋土中，以防人畜中毒）。每亩防治一次，喷用量是二百斤到三百斤。配制的药液都要现配现用，放置一天以上，就会变质失效。
