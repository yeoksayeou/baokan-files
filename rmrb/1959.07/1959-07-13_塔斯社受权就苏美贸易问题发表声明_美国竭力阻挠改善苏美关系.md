Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 11th. TASS is authorized to issue a statement refuting the recent statement by the U.S. State Department on Soviet-American trade issues. The main point of the U.S. statement is that expanding trade with the Soviet Union is unfavorable to the United States and would strengthen the Soviet Union's military potential.

The TASS statement points out that the U.S. State Department's statement reflects the intention of certain groups in the United States: to prevent any improvement in U.S.-Soviet trade relations and other relations by all possible means. This intention is inconsistent with the assurances frequently made by U.S. national leaders of hoping to live in peace and friendship with the Soviet Union.

The statement said that the United States not only has no trade relations with the Soviet Union, but also implements discriminatory laws to obstruct and directly prohibit trade with the Soviet Union. Some say that this is in the interest of U.S. security. They say that if certain commodities and equipment are sold to the Soviet Union, then this step, as the above-mentioned statement of the State Department says, "will strengthen the potential enemy." Such an attitude towards the mutual relations of the two major powers is unacceptable, because this attitude precisely means cultivating hostility and inciting one country against another.

It is also impossible not to notice that the U.S. State Department's statement was made at a time when the Soviet government and the U.S. government are jointly participating in the work of the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference, and the mission of the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference is to bring about a certain degree of relaxation in international relations (including Soviet-American relations).

The statement pointed out that the argument of "potential enemy" serves only one purpose: to stir up distrust between the Soviet Union and the United States and exacerbate the "Cold War."

The statement said that the policy of stipulating artificial restrictions on trade with the Soviet Union has long been a complete failure. The American groups responsible for this policy have long comforted themselves and their North Atlantic Group allies with the following illusion: that shrinking trade with the Soviet Union and socialist countries would lead to the economic collapse of these countries, or at least hinder their progress in developing their economies and technologies. However, it was precisely when the United States was implementing a shortsighted policy of resisting and restricting trade relations with the Soviet Union that the Soviet Union discovered the secret of using hydrogen energy, earlier than the United States. The Soviet Union launched earth satellites into space, also much earlier than the United States. The Soviet Union produced intercontinental ballistic rockets, which the United States does not have to this day.

Some people wrongly believe that if American goods and machines are not sold to the Soviet Union, Soviet technological development and economic prosperity can be hindered. Haven't these real victories of Soviet technological thought and economic strength shown that these people's intentions are completely unfounded and absurd? It should be known that the Soviet Union has everything that the United States can sell to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union can develop any industrial sector and can completely satisfy its own requirements by its own strength. Of course, the Soviet Union can purchase some commodities in the United States to replace the production of these commodities in its own country, which is very beneficial to the Soviet Union. The United States, like the Soviet Union, can also benefit from this. Regarding this, all American industrialists who have not lost the ability to calmly assess the situation admit.

In addition, the development of broad trade relations between the two most economically powerful countries is not only mutually beneficial to both countries, but also can promote the easing of international tensions, strengthen trust between countries, and benefit the cause of world peace.

In the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council, some countries that vote with the United States in favor of these or those decisions and resolutions have adopted a more realistic approach to the issue of developing economic ties with the Soviet Union and socialist countries. The Soviet Union welcomes the significant progress made in strengthening and expanding trade with Britain, France, West Germany, and many other countries in the last year or two.

It is up to the United States to develop or not develop trade with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union does not feel any loss without trade with the United States. The statement pointed out that if the moment chosen by the U.S. State Department to issue the statement had not been conspicuous, it could have been regarded as a routine and monotonous phenomenon. However, this statement was clearly chosen to be published at the time when the Soviet Exhibition was opening in New York and the American Exhibition was about to open in the Soviet Union.

It is difficult to avoid the impression that the U.S. State Department wants to dilute the interest of Americans, especially industrialists, in Soviet exhibits with its own statement.

Due to the publication of the State Department's statement, another question arises: What is the purpose of organizing the American Exhibition in Moscow? Because if we start from this statement, then we must come to the conclusion that this exhibition is by no means for promoting the development of Soviet-American trade.

In the Soviet Union, everyone believes that the holding of mutual exhibitions between the Soviet Union and the United States should not serve the purpose of the "Cold War," but should promote the development of ties and cooperation between the two countries, first of all to promote ties and cooperation in trade; should promote the mutual understanding and friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and the United States.

The U.S State Departments statement is to continue obstructing the development of trade between the Soviet Union and the United States, therefore, it certainly cannot promote the development of trust and cooperation between the two countries, and this trust and cooperation is not only necessary for the peoples of these two countries, but also is in the interest of the people of all other countries and is in the interest of peace.

### 塔斯社受权就苏美贸易问题发表声明  美国竭力阻挠改善苏美关系

    塔斯社受权就苏美贸易问题发表声明
    美国竭力阻挠改善苏美关系
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科11日讯：塔斯社受权发表声明，驳斥最近美国国务院就苏美贸易问题所发表的声明，美国的这个声明的主要意思是说，同苏联扩大贸易，对美国是不利的，会加强苏联的军事潜力。
    塔斯社的声明指出，美国国务院的声明反映了美国某些集团的意图：尽一切可能不让美苏贸易关系和其他关系有任何改善。这种意图同美国国家领导人时常发表的希望同苏联和平友好相处的保证是不相符合的。
    声明说，美国不仅同苏联没有贸易关系，而且实施歧视性的法律，阻挠并直接禁止同苏联的贸易。有人说，这是出于美国安全的利益，他们说，如果把某些商品和设备卖给苏联，那么，这种步骤，如国务院的上述声明所说的，“会加强潜在的敌人”。对两个大国的互相关系采取这种态度是不能容许的，因为这种态度正是意味着培植敌对情绪和挑唆一个国家去反对另一个国家。
    还不能不注意到：美国国务院的声明是在这样的时候提出的，这时，苏联政府和美国政府正共同参加日内瓦外长会议的工作，而日内瓦外长会议的使命是使国际关系（包括苏美关系）有一定的缓和。
    声明指出，“潜在的敌人”的论调只是为一个目的服务：煽起苏联和美国之间的不信任、加剧“冷战”。
    声明说，在同苏联的贸易上规定人为限制的政策早已完全失败了。对这种政策负责的美国集团长时期用下列幻想宽慰自己和他们的北大西洋集团盟友，即认为收缩同苏联和社会主义国家的贸易会导致这些国家的经济崩溃，或者至少可以阻挠它们在发展经济和技术的道路上的前进步伐。但是，正是在美国实行没有远见的、抵制和限制同苏联的贸易联系的政策的时候，苏联发现了利用氢能的秘密，而且比美国要早，苏联向宇宙发射了地球人造卫星，也比美国早得多，苏联制成了洲际弹道火箭，而美国直到如今还没有。
    有些人妄以为，如果不把美国商品和机器卖给苏联，就可以阻碍苏联的技术发展和经济繁荣。难道苏联的技术思想和经济力量的这些真正的胜利没有表明，这些人士的打算是完全没有根据和荒谬的吗？要知道，凡是美国可以卖给苏联的，苏联自己都有，苏联可以发展任何工业部门，可以靠自己的力量完全满足自己的要求。当然，苏联可以在美国购买一些商品，以代替在本国生产这些商品，这对苏联很有好处。而美国像苏联一样也可以由此得到好处。关于这一点，凡是没有丧失冷静地估计情况的能力的美国实业界人士都承认。
    此外，两个在经济上最强大的国家之间发展广泛的贸易关系，这不仅对两国互相有利，而且可以促进国际紧张局势的缓和，加强国与国之间的信任，有利于世界和平事业。
    在北大西洋公约组织理事会中，有些同美国一起投票赞成这些或那些决定和决议的国家，在发展同苏联和社会主义国家的经济联系的问题上却采取了比较现实的方针。苏联欢迎最近一、两年来在加强和扩大同英国、法国、西德以及其他许多国家的贸易中所取得的重大进展。
    同苏联发展或者不发展贸易，那是美国的事。苏联没有美国的贸易，并不感到有所损失，声明指出，如果不是美国国务院选定发表声明的时刻引人注意的话，本来是可以把它看作是一种因循惯例和千篇一律的现象的。然而，这个声明显然是选定在苏联展览会在纽约开幕和美国展览会即将在苏联开幕的时候发表的。
    很难避免这样一种印象，即美国国务院想用自己的声明来冲淡美国人，首先是实业界人士对苏联展览品的兴趣。
    由于国务院声明的发表，产生了另一个问题：在莫斯科组织美国展览会追求着怎样的目的呢？因为如果从这个声明出发，那末必然得出这样的结论：这个展览会绝不是为了促进苏美贸易的发展。
    在苏联，大家都认为，苏美之间互相举办展览会应该不是为“冷战”的目的服务，而应该是为了促进两国之间的联系和合作的发展，首先是促进贸易方面的联系和合作的发展；应该是促进苏美两国人民之间的互相了解和友谊的加强。
    美国国务院的声明是为了要继续阻碍苏美之间贸易的发展，因此，它当然不能促进两国之间的信任和合作的发展，而这种信任和合作不仅是这两国人民所必需的，而且也是符合所有其他各国人民的利益的，是符合和平的利益的。
