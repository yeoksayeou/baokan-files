    Remembering the Days in Poland
    Last year, throughout the red month of May, we traveled in Poland. Starting from Warsaw, we went south to the Polish border in the Carpathian Mountains, west to Poznan, and north to the Baltic coast. Important industrial areas, scenic spots, and ancient cultural cities all bear the footprints of us visitors. As we sped along the asphalt roads, as dense as a spiderweb, in our cars, gazing at the lush forests and vast fields, and bathed in the gentle breeze saturated with the fragrance of flowers and the breath of spring, a feeling of admiration arose spontaneously. The natural scenery of this country is certainly beautiful, but even more beautiful are the Polish people.
    If you browse through Polish history, recalling the three partitions of Poland from 1772 to 1795 and the one hundred and thirty years of national subjugation since 1795, if you look at the ruins of Warsaw and the bullet marks on the buildings, if you visit the Auschwitz concentration camp and see the heinous crimes of the Hitler bandits who murdered six million people with guns, gallows, and fire, you will know what a difficult and tortuous path the Polish people walked in the past. However, in the long and heroic struggle, the Polish people found the truth and saw the way forward. All of this can be felt concretely and deeply in the labor of rebuilding Warsaw from the ruins, in the vigorous socialist construction throughout the country, and in the workers' careful patching of ancient statues shattered by bullets.
    Even on days when the sky is clear over Poland, the Silesian industrial area is filled with smoke. With factories densely packed and chimneys standing tall, you can see the achievements of the Polish people's construction over the past decade. One day, after visiting a huge steel mill, we went down into a mine in Katowice. Here, you can see how the Polish working class, twenty-four hours a day, tirelessly and intensely brings light and heat from the depths of the earth to the world. We wound our way through the crisscrossing tunnels of the mine. The old workers, the young workers, all of them were so simple and enthusiastic. Covered in mud and with coal dust on their faces, they worked and calculated every second to see how much they were creating for life. From the many determined postures and deep gazes, I clearly saw how they were strengthening the power of this socialist country with their products every minute and every second. We met an old worker who had been working in the mine since childhood. Comrade Bierut once shook his hand, thanking him for his loyalty and heroism during the war years and for his extraordinary labor in socialist construction. This old worker shook our hands and said seriously and slowly: "The Polish miners deeply know their lofty mission in this great era, and therefore they are working actively and diligently." He and the chairman of the trade union led us to visit a youth shock brigade of coal miners. The coal mining machine roared, and the conveyor belt transported the shiny black coal, flowing along the tunnel like a stream. Many young people, each with a childlike appearance and a strong body. The young leader of the shock brigade was only twenty years old, but he directed hundreds of young people to mine one hundred and fifty tons of coal in each shift. The young people worked and shouted, as if they wanted to use the power of their youth to give life to the coal that had been sleeping for hundreds of millions of years. In this sound of roaring machines and the cheers of the people, don't you vividly feel how socialism is boiling around you?
    One day in late May, after a heavy rain, the weather cleared. The asphalt road was washed clean and bright by the rain. The air was exceptionally fresh. The forests, grasslands, and vast wheat fields like turquoise waves seemed to be coated with a layer of oil, and at this time, we were again in the "May First" collective farm near the ancient city of Poznan. Square houses were scattered sparsely around the collective farm office. Kind old mothers, capable middle-aged women, lively and curious young girls all welcomed the Chinese guests to their homes. Yes, in each household, you can see from the farmers' introductions and their affluence, which is by no means comparable to the past, that the farmers here have deeply realized from their own personal experience what kind of today and tomorrow the road indicated by socialism—the road of agricultural collectivization—has brought them. Twenty-one households live here, with more than forty "full laborers," including seventeen Communist Party members. Since its establishment in the spring of 1949, this farm has always held high the red flag of collectivization. Even in the winter of 1956 and the spring of 1957, when most of the farms in this area collapsed, the Communist Party members of this farm led the masses of farmers to unanimously vow: "We will do it to the end, even if the seas run dry and the rocks crumble!" They survived the difficult period and moved forward in great strides. The Party and the state gave them high praise. Today, the "May First" collective farm has become an advanced banner of the collectivization movement in this area. In the past year or two, under its influence, hundreds of collective farms have been organized in the Poznan area.
    The chairman of the farm, Bonig, said: "The cannons of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the bayonets of Hitler, and the sweet words and shameless deeds of the bourgeoisie, the Polish peasants understand them too well!" The branch secretary, Swiergowski, looked at the certificate of merit issued to them by the government on the office wall and added: "From this you know what kind of experience we have based on to choose the direction forward, and why we are so determined."
    When we said goodbye, the men, women, old and young here were reluctant to part, and as I looked at those many simple, sincere and enthusiastic faces, an idea flashed in my mind: for the working people, the ideals that people regard as life are the summary of their life experiences, the concentration of their wishes.
    A little over a day after leaving here, we were again on the Baltic coast. This is a different world, a different kind of scenery. Sometimes, we walked leisurely along the hilly areas on the coast, sometimes we watched the large ships coming from across the oceans, sometimes we strolled in the seaside park, and sometimes we lay by the forest on the protruding island, listening to how the sea breathes deeply and rhythmically.
    One day, we went to visit a state-owned fishing port. The manager of the fishing port was named Magda, a tall, beautiful and talkative middle-aged man. The first thing he said when he saw us was: "I think Chinese people must all like the ocean, because people who like the ocean always have a broad mind." After receiving our affirmative answer, he hugged my shoulders, as happy as a child. As if wanting to guide us to re-understand the ocean, he took us to the thirteen-story high tower of the Fishermen's Workers' Club, overlooking the boundless Baltic Sea. The sea breeze was intoxicating. The sea water hit the rocks below the tower, like the sound of a huge pine forest roaring. Nearby, the waves flashed with bright patches, like many white birds flying up and falling down. In the distance, the ocean seemed calm, black and green. Holding a telescope, you could occasionally see a black spot, which was a large ship moving forward on the waves.
    Then, Comrade Magda led us to the fishing port. Here, some fishing nets were dried on the scattered buildings, and a few small wooden boats waiting to be repaired were parked by the sea, allowing the waves to beat against them. Comrade Magda told us that the day before yesterday, the fishermen here had all sailed their fishing boats into the ocean to fish. It is said that some of the fishery workers working at this fishing port are new to the sea, some have been living on fishing boats for decades, and some have sent off countless springs, summers, autumns, and winters in the stormy waves for generations. Look, next to the small wooden houses by the sea, several young women are humming some songs calmly and leisurely while looking at the ocean. The children in their arms also waved their small hands to the ocean. Is the woman blessing her husband who went out to sea to fish? Or is she expecting her husband to return sooner? Or is she whispering to the child in her arms about the character, appearance, sound, and smell of the sea? According to Comrade Magda, in the old society, the women who lived by the sea would stand by the sea and sob and weep while watching the turbulent waves after sending off their fathers, husbands, or sons to sea to fish. At night, they would push open the small windows and pray to the sea all night long, but the fate of being buried in the belly of a fish still fell on their loved ones. Today, the fishery workers—the fishermen of the past—are not fighting the ocean just to make a living, but are riding the wind and waves, casting wide nets, as if they want to capture the entire ocean and make it serve the socialist cause.
    Unfortunately, today the opportunity is not good, and I cannot have a heart-to-heart talk with those many heroes on the sea, and I cannot help but feel a sense of loss.
    Comrade Magda saw through our thoughts and said: "Even if you can't see them, you can still talk to them. Come, comrades." After saying that, he led us to a room upstairs, which was the radio telephone room. Magda called to the ocean through the microphone: "Hello, hello! Find fishing boat number sixty...find fishing boat number one hundred and twenty-five...Oh! Is that Orski? Haha, I've caught your voice." A reply came from afar: "Is that Manager Comrade? Please rest assured, the wind is calm and the waves are gentle." Comrade Magda said: "Here are a few Chinese comrades who want to speak to you." The fishermen shouted: "Dear Chinese comrades—visitors from afar." Comrade Du Ai, who was traveling with me, broadcast that excited voice to the distance through the microphone: "We come from China, bringing greetings from the Chinese people..." Followed by warm applause, a voice came again: "Please, dear comrade, introduce the situation of China's construction..." Manager Comrade Magda replied: "The topic you've given is too big, it won't be too late to listen to the report when you come back from completing the task."
    Comrade Du Ai continued: "Comrades, we came to Poland from China and saw the strength and prosperity of the socialist family..." Before he could finish speaking, the cheers from the countless fishing boats on the ocean immediately swept across the Baltic Sea and reached this small radio telephone room. The rough, joyful, and chaotic sounds echoed in the room, and could not be calmed down for a long time, as if you were watching a mass meeting with banners waving and crowds surging. I couldn't help but climb on the window, looking at the vast sea, I could see nothing but the water and the sky. But I felt that under the clear blue sky, above the exciting sea, was filled with the heartfelt concern of people for the common cause, filled with the unparalleled deep feelings and mutual encouragement of the Chinese and Polish people...

    回忆在波兰度过的日子杜鹏程
    去年，在整个红五月里，我们在波兰国土上游历。从华沙出发，南到喀尔巴阡山的波兰国境线上，西到波兹南，北到波罗的海滨。重要的工业区、名胜区和文化古城里，都留下我们这些访问者的足迹。当我们乘着车子，在密如蛛网的柏油公路上飞驰的时候，望着那茂密的森林，广阔的原野，沐浴着那饱和着花香和春天气息的微风，一种赞叹的心情便悠然而生。这个国家的自然风光固然优美，但是更优美的却是波兰人民。
    你如果翻阅波兰历史，回忆一下1772年到1795年波兰三次被瓜分和自1795年后的一百三十年的亡国生活，你如果看看华沙的废墟和建筑物上的斑斑弹迹，你如果到奥斯威辛集中营看看希特勒匪徒用枪毙、绞架和烈火杀死的六百万人的滔天罪行，你就知道波兰人民往日走过一条怎样艰难而曲折的道路。但是，在长久而英勇的斗争中，波兰人民却找到了真理，看清了道路。这一切，在人们把华沙从废墟中建立起来的劳动中，在全国各地蓬勃发展的社会主义建设中，在工人们仔细镶补那被子弹打破的古代雕像的动作中，你都能具体而深切地感觉到。
    即使在波兰上空万里无云的日子里，西里西亚工业区也是满天烟雾。工厂密布，烟囱林立，在这儿你可以集中地看到波兰人民十几年来建设的成就。一天，我们参观了巨大的炼钢厂之后，又下到卡托维兹的一个矿井中去。在这里，你就看到：每天二十四小时，波兰工人阶级怎样不息而紧张地把光和热从地层深处带到人间来。我们顺着矿井里纵横交错的巷道绕来走去。年老的工人，年青的工人，一个个都那么朴实而热情。他们满身泥水，满脸煤黑，但是，却一面劳动一边掐算着每一秒钟为生活创造了多少东西。我从那许多坚毅的姿态和深沉的目光中，清楚地看到，他们怎样每时每分用自己的产品增强这个社会主义国家的威力。我们遇到一位从儿童时期就在矿井里工作的老工人，贝鲁特同志曾经握着他的手，感谢他在战争年代的忠诚和英勇，感谢他在社会主义建设中的非凡劳动。这位老工人握着我们的手，严肃而缓慢地说：“波兰的矿工们，深知他们在这伟大的年代里的崇高使命，因而他们积极而努力地劳动着。”他和工会主席一起带领我们去拜访一支采煤的青年突击队。采煤机发出震耳的吼声，输送带运送着黑亮的煤块，像流水似地顺着巷道流去。许多青年人，一个个都有着孩子式的模样和健壮的躯体。那位青年突击队长，仅二十岁，可是他指挥着成百名青年，在每班工作中开采一百五十吨煤炭。青年们劳动着，呼喊着，仿佛他们要用自己的青春力量，使沉睡了亿万年的煤炭获得生命似的。在这种机器轰响声和人们欢呼声中，你不是生动地感觉到社会主义怎样在你周围沸腾吗？
    5月下旬的一天，大雨之后，天气放晴。柏油公路被雨水洗刷得明光净亮。空气异常清新。森林、草地和万顷碧波似的麦田，像涂了一层油似的，而这时候，我们又置身在波兹南古城附近的“五一”集体农庄里。一幢幢的方形的房子，稀稀疏疏地散布在集体农庄办公室的周围。和善的老妈妈，善理家务的中年妇女，活泼而好奇的少女们，都欢迎中国来的客人到他们家里去作客。是的，在各家各户，你从农民们的介绍和那决非往昔能比的富裕生活中看到，这里的农民由自己的切身经验里，已深刻地体会到社会主义所指示的道路——农业集体化的道路，给他们带来什么样的今天和明天。这里居住着二十一户人家，有四十多个“全劳力”。其中有十七名共产党员。这个农庄从1949年春成立起到如今，始终高举着集体化的红旗，即使在1956年冬季和1957年春季，这个地区大部分农庄垮了的时候，这个农庄的共产党员们率领着农民群众，一致发出誓言：“海枯石烂我们也要干到底！”他们度过了困难的时期，又大踏步地向前走去。党和国家给了他们很高的褒奖。如今，“五一”集体农庄已成为这一带集体化运动的先进的旗帜。近一两年，在它的影响下，波兹南地区又组织起几百个集体农庄。
    农庄主席卜尼格说：“奥匈帝国的大炮，希特勒的刺刀，资产阶级的甜言蜜语和无耻的勾当，波兰农民了解得太清楚了！”支部书记希维尔格夫斯基望着办公室墙壁上政府发给他们的奖状，补充说：“由此你们就知道，我们根据什么样的经验选择了前进的方向，为什么如此坚决。”
    当我们告别的时候，这里的男女老少依依不舍，而我望着那许多淳朴、诚挚而热情的面孔，脑子里闪过这样一个想法：对劳动人民说，那被人们视若生命的理想，就是他们生活经验的总结，就是他们的愿望的集中。
    离开这里一天多之后，我们又置身于波罗的海滨了。这里别是一番天地，别是一样风光。有时候，我们沿着海岸上的丘陵地带信步走去，有时候望着那远涉重洋而来的大轮船，有时候在海上公园里散步，有时候躺在突出的小岛上的丛林边倾听大海在怎样深沉而有节奏地呼吸。
    有一天，我们去访问一个国营渔港。渔港的经理叫玛格达，魁梧、漂亮而健谈的中年人。他看见我们的第一句话就是：“我想，中国人一定都很喜欢海洋，因为喜欢海洋的人胸怀总是广阔的。”得到我们肯定的答复之后，他就抱着我的肩膀，高兴得像小孩子一样。他像要引导我们重新认识海洋似的，把我们带到渔业工人俱乐部的十三层的高塔上，了望无边无际的波罗的海。海风吹来，令人陶醉。海水冲激着塔下边的岩石，像巨大的松林吼起的涛声。近处，海浪闪着片片光亮，像是许多白色的大鸟飞起来又落下去似的。远处，海洋似乎是平静的，黑绿色的。拿着望远镜，偶尔可以看见一个黑点，那是凌波前进的大轮船。
    接着，玛格达同志带领我们到渔港上，这里，稀稀落落的建筑物上晒了一些鱼网，还有几只等待修理的小木船停泊在海边，任浪花拍打。玛格达同志告诉我们，前天，这里打鱼的人都驾着渔船到大海洋中去捕鱼了。据说，在这个渔港上工作的渔业工人，有的是海上的新手，有的几十年来就在渔船上生活，有的是祖祖辈辈在惊涛骇浪中送走了无法数计的春夏秋冬。你看，海边的小木房子边，有几位青年妇女，望着海洋泰然而闲适地哼着什么歌曲。她们怀抱中的小孩也向海洋挥着小手。那妇女在为出海打鱼的丈夫祝福呢？还是期望着丈夫早些归来？抑或给她怀抱中的孩子低声讲述着海的性格、面貌、声音和气味呢？据玛格达同志说，在旧社会，居住在海边的妇女们，送走父亲、丈夫或儿子出海打鱼之后，白天就站在海边望着那起伏的波涛饮泣吞泪，夜晚推开小窗对着大海彻夜祈祷，但是葬身鱼腹的命运依然落到她们亲人的头上。如今，渔业工人——当年的渔民，不是为了糊口才和海洋搏斗，而是乘风破浪，撒开大网，仿佛要把这整个海洋捕捉起来，让它为社会主义事业服务。
    可惜，今天机遇不巧，不能和那许多海上的英雄们促膝谈心，不免有怅然之感。
    玛格达同志看破了我们的心思，他说：“看不到他们，也还可以和他们交谈。来，同志们。”说罢，他就把我们领到一座楼上的房间里，这是无线电话室。玛格达对着送话筒向海洋呼唤：“喂，喂！找六十号渔船……找一百二十五号渔船，……噢！你是奥尔斯基？哈哈，我可捉住了你的声音呵。”远方传来回答声：“经理同志吗？请放心，风平浪静。”玛格达同志说：“这里有几位中国同志向你们讲话。”渔民们喊道：“亲爱的中国的同志——远方来客。”和我同行的杜埃同志通过送话筒，把那激动的声音播送到远方去了：“我们从中国来，带来中国人民的问候……”随着热烈的鼓掌声又送来声音：“请你，亲爱的同志，介绍一下中国建设的情况……”经理玛格达同志回答说：“你出的题目太大，完成任务回来再听报告也不迟”。
    杜埃同志继续讲：“同志们，我们从中国到波兰，看到社会主义大家庭的强大、富饶……”。话未落音，立刻，那海洋上的无数渔船上的欢呼声掠过波罗的海的上空，传到这小小的无线电话室来了。粗犷、欢乐的杂乱的声音，在这房子里回荡，久久不能平息，仿佛你眼前正在举行一个旗帜招展、万头钻动的群众大会一样。我情不自禁地爬在窗子上，望着浩瀚的大海，除了水天相接之外，什么也看不见。但是我觉得，在明净的蓝天之下，激动着的大海之上，充满人们对共同事业的热烈关怀的心声，充满中波人民的无比深情和相互鼓舞……
