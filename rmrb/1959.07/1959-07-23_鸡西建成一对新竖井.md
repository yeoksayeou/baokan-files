Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 22nd: The newly built Erdaohuzi vertical shafts of the Jixi Mining Bureau in Heilongjiang Province have been completed. They will soon be officially put into production to produce high-quality coking coal for the country.

The construction of this pair of vertical shafts began in January 1957. The initial design was to build a pair of vertical shafts with an annual output of 900,000 tons. During the construction process, relevant departments re-modified the design based on the many coal seams in this coalfield; the two pairs of small inclined shafts originally opened for the construction of the vertical shafts were equipped with production equipment with an annual output of 150,000 tons of coal to mine coal seams closer to the surface, while the vertical shafts mined deeper coal seams. In this way, the total annual output of the entire coal mine remains 900,000 tons, but the time of coal production can be advanced, and construction funds can be saved. The two pairs of inclined shafts were put into production in July last year, and the vertical shafts were completed five months ahead of schedule.

    鸡西建成一对新竖井
    据新华社哈尔滨22日电　黑龙江省鸡西矿务局新建二道河子竖井已经建成。不久即将正式投入生产，为国家生产优质炼焦煤。
    这对竖井是1957年1月动工兴建的。最初设计建设一对年产九十万吨的竖井。在建设过程中，有关部门根据这个煤田煤层多的情况，重新修改了设计；在原来为建设竖井开的两对小斜井，分别安装年产十五万吨煤的生产设备，以开采离地表较近的煤层，竖井则开采深处的煤层。这样，整个煤矿的年产量仍然是九十万吨，出煤的时间却可以提前，同时能够节约建设资金。两对斜井已经在去年7月投入生产，竖井也比原计划提前五个月建成。
