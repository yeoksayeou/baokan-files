Editor's Note:

    The work experience of the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League's exchange group branch proves that the grassroots organizations of the League are indeed good assistants to the Party in publicizing and implementing the Party's policies and resolutions, improving work, and completing tasks. They are vigorous, do not retreat in the face of difficulties, always move forward bravely, and strive to complete the tasks assigned by the Party. Party organizations and League leading organs should give more help and care to the League's grassroots organizations, regularly help them summarize and exchange experiences, help them overcome difficulties and solve various major problems in work and understanding; and find a set of working methods suitable for the characteristics of young people, and help them get the necessary support and assistance from relevant aspects in their work. These assistance measures can make the League's grassroots organizations more active and provide more effective assistance to the Party organizations, and cannot be taken lightly.
    Some places have ignored the role of the League's grassroots organizations, while others have not relied on them to carry out youth work, so that some League grassroots organizations have failed to be good assistants to the Party. Now, the experience exchange meeting of League branch secretaries of industrial and mining enterprises held by the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League is one of the important methods to summarize and exchange experiences and promote the work of the League's grassroots organizations. This method has created conditions for the League's grassroots organizations to do their work well. We hope that all localities will adopt more methods to enable the League's grassroots organizations to better play the role of the Party's assistants.

    给党培养更多的好助手
    成都市共青团市委交流团支部的工作经验证明，团的基层组织，在宣传和执行党的政策、决议、改进工作、完成任务等方面，的确是党的好助手。他们生气勃勃，在困难面前不退缩，总是勇往直前，努力完成党所交付的任务。党组织和团的领导机关，要给团的基层组织更多的帮助和关怀，经常地帮助他们总结和交流经验，帮助他们克服困难、解决工作和认识上的各项重大问题；并找出一套适合青年特点的工作方法，帮助他们在工作中能够得到有关方面的必要的支持和协助。这些帮助，可以使团的基层组织更加活跃，对党组织的帮助更加有力，不能等闲视之。
    有的地方忽视了团的基层组织的作用，有的则不依靠它们进行青年工作，以致有些团的基层组织未能做好党的助手。现在，成都市团市委召开的工矿企业单位团支部书记交流经验的会议，是一个总结交流经验、推进团的基层组织工作的重要方法之一。这一方法为团的基层组织做好工作创造了条件。我们希望各地采用更多的方法，使团的基层组织更好地发挥党的助手作用。
