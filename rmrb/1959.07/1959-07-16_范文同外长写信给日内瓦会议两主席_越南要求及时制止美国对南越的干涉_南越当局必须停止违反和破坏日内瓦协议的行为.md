Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 15th - It was announced here today that the Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Pham Van Dong, wrote to the Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference on July 7th regarding the implementation of the 1954 Geneva Agreements in Vietnam and Laos over the past five years.

	This letter, addressed to the Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko and British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, firstly comprehensively exposed a series of crimes committed by the South Vietnamese authorities over the past five years in constantly violating and undermining the Geneva Agreements. It also requested that the relevant parties resolutely and promptly cease U.S. interference in South Vietnam, and demanded that the South Vietnamese authorities thoroughly implement the Geneva Agreements and ensure that the various institutions established under the agreements are able to operate effectively.

	The letter states that it has been exactly five years since the restoration of peace in Indochina. The situation of the implementation of the Geneva Agreements in the two regions of North and South Vietnam is as follows: The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has always respected and strictly implemented the agreements, while the South Vietnamese authorities have been violating and undermining the agreements. The letter recounts the tremendous efforts made by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in implementing the agreements. The letter states: "Since July 1955, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly proposed to the South Vietnamese authorities to hold consultations in order to discuss holding free general elections throughout the country to achieve the unification of Vietnam. Based on the urgent wishes of the people of the whole country, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam successively sent two open letters to the South Vietnamese authorities on March 7th and December 22nd, 1958, putting forward many suggestions that would be conducive to easing the situation and creating conditions for further rapprochement and mutual understanding between the two sides, hoping to further realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland."

	The letter states that the attitude of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in consistently respecting and strictly implementing the agreements has been acknowledged by the periodic reports of the International Commission for Vietnam to the Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference, and has also been warmly supported by the people of Vietnam and sympathized with and supported by progressive public opinion in the world.

	The letter then points out: "However, the South Vietnamese authorities have consistently pursued the policy of the United States and taken completely opposite actions, increasingly seriously violating and undermining the various clauses and basic principles of the Geneva Agreements."

	The letter states: "For five years, the South Vietnamese authorities, disregarding the urgent demands of the Vietnamese people, have stubbornly rejected the suggestions of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to hold consultations to achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland. They have cruelly severed all contacts between the two sides, refused to restore normal relations between the North and the South, including the exchange of letters. They have conspired to turn the temporary military demarcation line into a political and territorial boundary. They have not accepted the earnest appeal of the two chairmen on May 8th, 1956, and the specific suggestions put forward in the two open letters of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on March 7th and December 22nd, 1958. They have become increasingly blatant in embarking on the road of long-term division of Vietnam and preparation for war that imperialism had long arranged for them."

	The letter states: "At the same time, under the instigation and assistance of the United States, the South Vietnamese authorities have increasingly seriously, continuously and openly violated the military, free and democratic and other clauses of the Geneva Agreements."

	The letter points out that for five years, the South Vietnamese authorities have allowed the United States to deepen its interference in South Vietnam. The United States has successively shipped more than two thousand new military advisors and personnel into South Vietnam, and allowed U.S. military delegations to be illegally stationed in South Vietnam for a long time. As of March 1958, a total of 380 ship voyages had transported approximately 100,000 tons of U.S. weapons and war materials into South Vietnam. Since 1956, an average of one U.S. military aircraft per day has transported U.S. military personnel or weapons into South Vietnam. Recently, the United States has gone even further in attempting to transport atomic weapons and rocket weapons into South Vietnam.

	The letter also points out: "Many airports for use by U.S. jet aircraft and strategic air forces have been or are being expanded, and the equipment of many naval ports is also being strengthened. The entire strategic highway system is being accelerated to serve the U.S. military plan in South Vietnam, while connecting South Vietnam with Laos and Thailand." The letter points out that all of the above "aims to turn South Vietnam into one of the most important military bases of the United States in Southeast Asia."

	The letter condemns the collusion between the South Vietnamese authorities and the Southeast Asia military bloc. The letter points out that this collusion has recently developed to the extent of signing bilateral agreements of a military nature with member states of this bloc or certain countries so-called "protected" by it.

	The letter states that the bilateral agreements signed between South Vietnam and the United States, the Philippines and Laos, etc., use the name of "economic cooperation" or "friendship" to cover up the military nature of its clauses. "The signing of these agreements is actually a new step taken by the United States in its attempt to gradually drag South Vietnam into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization - one of the tools for U.S. interference and war-making in the region."

	The letter then lists a large number of facts, exposing the extremely serious violations of Article 14(c) of the Geneva Agreements by the South Vietnamese authorities over the past five years. (Note: This clause stipulates that no retaliation or discrimination shall be taken against individuals and groups because of their activities during the period of hostilities, and guarantees their democratic freedoms.) The letter states: The South Vietnamese authorities' "so-called 'denounce the Communists, eliminate the Communists' campaign and the 'sweeps,' arrests, tortures, imprisonments, and massacres of patriotic people have occurred year after year, covering the entire South Vietnam. Recently, due to the increasingly deeper interference of the United States, the South Vietnamese authorities have adopted all barbaric means to strengthen their repression and persecution. For example, the South Vietnamese authorities poisoned the food of 6,000 patriots in the Phu Loi concentration camp, bombarded, bombed, and strafed innocent civilians in Bien Hoa Province with artillery and aircraft, and promulgated Decree No. 10 of 1959 on the establishment of mobile 'special military courts'. This anti-democratic decree violates the minimum freedom rights of mankind and violates the most basic principles of law. The South Vietnamese authorities' policy of terror and suppression over the years has caused tremendous losses to the people of South Vietnam. According to incomplete statistics, as of February 1959, a total of 180,843 people had been arrested, 10,185 people had been injured or disabled, and 4,971 people had died or disappeared."

	The letter states that the South Vietnamese authorities also "tried every means to obstruct the work of the various institutions established under the 1954 Geneva Agreements, causing the activities of the Joint Commission to cease for more than three years, and causing the International Commission to encounter many difficulties in performing its task of supervising and monitoring the implementation of the agreements in South Vietnam."

	The letter states, concerning the relations between South Vietnam and Cambodia and Laos, that the South Vietnamese authorities sent troops to invade the territory of the Kingdom of Cambodia, instigated and supported Cambodian reactionaries in conspiring against the Kingdom government that pursued a policy of peace and neutrality. The South Vietnamese authorities also colluded closely with the pro-American government of Laos. Their personnel are conducting harassment and provocations in the border area between Laos and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, threatening the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and creating tension in Indochina.

	The letter points out: All the above facts show that the U.S. authorities and the South Vietnamese authorities are deliberately undermining the Geneva Agreements, attempting to divide Vietnam for a long time, stepping up war preparations, cruelly suppressing patriotic and progressive forces in South Vietnam, and turning South Vietnam into an aggressive springboard in the U.S. imperialists' plan to prepare for a new war in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

	The letter then discusses the situation in Laos. The letter states that the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression and war is making the situation in Laos increasingly serious. "The civil war there is still continuing. The Geneva Agreements are being violated more and more crudely, and the peace and security of the various nations in this region are being seriously threatened."

	The letter states that "the government of Phoui Sananikone, obeying the orders of the United States, has abandoned the Geneva Agreements, ignited the flames of civil war in Laos, and allowed the United States to transport hundreds of officers and thousands of tons of war materials into Laos."

	The letter points out: "As a signatory to the Geneva Agreements on Indochina, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam earnestly requests the Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference to promptly study the implementation of the Geneva Agreements in Vietnam and Laos, and to take positive measures, including providing appropriate suggestions to the relevant parties and to the participating countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference, in order to improve this situation and ensure that the various provisions of the Geneva Agreements can be implemented. This is in line with the legitimate aspirations of the Vietnamese people and will help maintain and consolidate peace in Southeast Asia and the world."

	Pham Van Dong stated in the letter: "The Vietnamese people, with a tradition of solidarity and struggle, will certainly continue to fight resolutely and unswervingly for the unification of the motherland and for world peace."

	Pham Van Dong attached a memorandum to this letter. The memorandum uses concrete examples and figures to conclusively illustrate the crimes of the South Vietnamese authorities, under the instigation of the United States, in constantly violating the Geneva Agreements and stepping up war preparations, and points out that the U.S. policy of interference and provocation is the main obstacle to the cause of peaceful reunification of Vietnam. Pham Van Dong also sent the above letter to the participating countries of the Geneva Conference and the member countries of the International Commission for Vietnam.

    范文同外长写信给日内瓦会议两主席
    越南要求及时制止美国对南越的干涉
    南越当局必须停止违反和破坏日内瓦协议的行为
    新华社河内15日电　此间今天公布了越南民主共和国外交部长范文同7月7日就1954年日内瓦协议五年来在越南和老挝的履行情况写给日内瓦会议两主席的信。
    这封写给苏联外交部长葛罗米柯和英国外交大臣劳埃德的信，首先全面地揭露了南越当局五年来不断违反和破坏日内瓦协议的一系列罪行，并且要求有关方面坚决和及时地制止美国对南越的干涉，要求南越当局彻底履行日内瓦协议和保证根据协议成立的各个机构能够有效地进行活动。
    信中说，印度支那和平恢复已经整整五年，在越南北南两个地区履行日内瓦协议的情况是：越南民主共和国政府一直尊重和严格履行协议，而南越当局却一直在违反和破坏协议。信中追述了越南民主共和国在履行协议方面所作的巨大努力。信中说：“自1955年7月以来，越南民主共和国政府曾经多次向南越当局提出建议要求双方举行协商，以便讨论在全国范围内举行自由普选，实现越南的统一。越南民主共和国政府根据全国人民的迫切愿望，曾经先后在1958年3月7日和12月22日向南越当局发出了两封公开信，提出了有利于缓和局势、并为双方的进一步接近和互相了解创造条件的许多建议，希望能够进而实现祖国的和平统一。”
    信中说，越南民主共和国政府一直尊重和严格履行协议的态度得到了越南国际委员会给日内瓦会议两主席的历次定期报告的承认，而且获得了越南全国人民的热烈拥护和世界进步舆论的同情和支持。
    信中接着指出：“然而，在南越当局方面却一直奉行美国的政策，采取了完全相反的行动，日益严重地违反和破坏日内瓦协议的各项条款和基本原则。”
    信中说：“五年来，南越当局不顾越南人民的迫切要求，一味拒绝越南民主共和国政府要求举行协商以实现和平统一祖国的建议。它们残忍地割断了双方的一切来往，拒绝恢复南北之间的正常关系，其中包括互通书信。它们阴谋把临时军事分界线变成政治和领土的疆界。它们没有接受两主席1956年5月8日的殷切呼吁和越南民主共和国政府1958年3月7日和12月22日两封公开信中提出的具体建议。它们愈来愈露骨地走上了帝国主义早就给它们安排的长期分割越南和准备战争的道路。”
    信中说：“与此同时，受美国指使和帮助的南越当局日益严重地连续地和明目张胆地违反了日内瓦协议中有关军事、自由民主和其他的一些条款。”
    信中指出，五年来，南越当局让美国日益加深对南越的干涉。美国先后向南越运入了二千多名新的军事顾问和人员，让美国军事代表团在南越非法地长期驻扎。截至1958年3月，共有轮船三百八十艘次把约十万吨美国武器和战争物资运入南越。从1956年以来，平均每天有一架美国军用飞机把美国的军事人员或武器运入南越。最近，美国又更进一步企图把原子武器和火箭武器运入南越。
    信中还指出：“许多供美国喷气式飞机和战略空军使用的飞机场已经或正在扩建，许多军港的设备也正在加强中。整个战略公路系统正在加紧修建中，以便为美国在南越的军事计划服务，同时把南越和老挝、泰国连接起来。”信中指出，上述这一切“目的在于把南越变成美国在东南亚的头等重要的军事基地之一。”
    信中谴责了南越当局同东南亚军事集团的勾结。信中指出，这种勾结最近已经发展到了同这个集团的成员国或所谓受它“保护”的若干国家签订带有军事性质的双边协定的程度。
    信中说，南越同美国、菲律宾和老挝等签订的双边协定，以“经济合作”或“友好”的名义来掩盖它的条款所带有的军事性质，“这些协定的签订，实际上是美国企图把南越逐步拉入东南亚条约组织——美国在这个地区的干涉和制造战争的工具之一——所采取的一个新的步骤。”
    信中接着列举大量事实，揭露了南越当局五年来极其严重地违反日内瓦协议第十四条丙款的行为。（按：这项条款规定不因个人和团体，和敌对行动期间的活动而对其加以任何报复和歧视，并保障其民主自由。）信中说：南越当局“所谓‘诉共、灭共’战役和对爱国人民的‘扫荡’、逮捕、拷打、监禁和屠杀事件，年复一年地连续发生，以至遍及整个南越。最近，由于美国日益深入的干涉，南越当局曾经采取了一切野蛮的办法来加强它们的镇压迫害。例如南越当局在富利集中营的六千名爱国者的饭里下毒药，用大炮和飞机轰击、轰炸和扫射边和省无辜平民，颁布关于成立流动的‘特别军事法庭’的1959年第十号法令。这个反民主的法令侵犯了人类最低限度的自由权利，违反了法律的最基本原则。几年来南越当局的恐怖镇压政策给南越人民造成了巨大损失。据不完全统计，截至1959年2月，共有十八万零八百四十三人被逮捕，一万零一百八十五人受伤或残废，四千九百七十一人死亡或失踪。”
    信中说，南越当局还“想尽种种办法来阻挠根据1954年日内瓦协议而成立的各个机构的工作，使联合委员会的活动停止了三年多，使国际委员会在执行监督和监察南越执行协议的任务时也遇到了很多困难”。
    信中谈到南越同柬埔寨和老挝的关系时说，南越当局派遣军队侵犯柬埔寨王国的领土，唆使和支持柬埔寨的反动分子阴谋反对执行和平中立政策的王国政府。南越当局还同老挝亲美政府密切勾结，它们的人员正在老挝同越南民主共和国的边境地区进行骚扰和挑衅，威胁了越南民主共和国的安全，在印度支那造成紧张局势。
    信中指出：上面一切事实都说明了美国当局和南越当局蓄意破坏日内瓦协议，企图长期分割越南，加紧备战，残酷地镇压南越的爱国进步力量，把南越变成美帝国主义准备在印度支那和东南亚重新挑起战争的计划中的一个侵略跳板。
    信中接着谈到老挝的局势。信中说，美帝国主义的侵略和战争政策使得老挝的局势越来越严重，“那里的内战还在继续中。日内瓦协议日益粗暴地被违反，这个地区各个民族的和平和安全正在受到严重的威胁”。
    信中说，“培·萨纳尼空政府听从美国的命令废弃了日内瓦协议，在老挝点起了内战的火焰，让美国把成百名军官和成千吨战争物资运入老挝。”
    信中指出：“作为关于印度支那的日内瓦协议的签字的一方，越南民主共和国政府恳切地要求日内瓦会议两主席迅速地对越南和老挝履行日内瓦协议的情况进行研究，并采取积极的措施，包括对有关双方和对1954年日内瓦会议参加国提供适当的建议，以便改善这种情况，保证日内瓦协议各项条款能够获得履行，这样做才符合越南人民的正当愿望，并有助于维护和巩固东南亚和世界的和平。”
    范文同在信中表示：“具有团结斗争传统的越南人民，一定继续不断地坚决地为祖国的统一和世界和平而斗争。”
    范文同随同这封信附上了一份备忘录。备忘录用具体的事例和数字确凿地说明南越当局在美国的指使下，不断地破坏日内瓦协议和加紧备战的罪行，并且指出，美国的干涉和挑衅政策是越南和平统一事业的主要障碍。范文同同时还把上面这封信分别寄给了日内瓦会议参加国和越南国际委员会成员国。
