Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 16th: According to TASS, the second plenary session after the resumption of the Foreign Ministers' Conference was held on the 15th, chaired by French Foreign Minister Couve de Murville.

De Murville, in his capacity as the French representative, spoke first at the meeting. He said that the Foreign Ministers' Conference would undoubtedly discuss the Soviet proposal of June 19, but he hoped to get some explanations regarding these proposals.

Instead of commenting on the Soviet proposal of June 19, De Murville raised the question to the Soviet delegation: why did the Soviet proposal not only mention the Berlin issue, but also stipulate the establishment of an All-German Committee? He said that this would force the conference to return to the entire German question.

After De Murville's speech, Gromyko spoke. He said that we have called attention to the fact that, up to now, the Western delegations have not given any clear answers to the Soviet government's latest proposals regarding the temporary status of West Berlin and the All-German Committee. Gromyko asked: We want to know, why is this? The United States, Britain, and France delegations supported the establishment of the All-German Committee at the beginning of the conference, but when the Soviet Union suggested the establishment of such a committee, stipulated its tasks, and put this issue on a practically feasible basis, they instead showed indifference to this proposal. How should this be evaluated? The explanation given by the French representative does not eliminate this question. We also want to know whether the Western three delegations agree that the representatives of the German Democratic Republic and the German Federal Republic in the All-German Committee should enjoy equal rights and equal opportunities, and that issues should be resolved in this committee through mutual agreement. If the Western three countries continue to oppose this, then please explain to them what they are afraid of if the Western countries oppose a situation in which no representative of any party participating in the committee enjoys a privileged position when making decisions? What kind of negotiating body is it if one party is given more favorable conditions than the other in advance?

Gromyko said that the representatives of the Western countries have repeatedly said that Germany should not be forced to accept a peace treaty. Everyone knows that this is precisely the position that the Soviet government has always adhered to. That is why the Soviet Union proposed the establishment of an All-German Committee so that the Germans could formulate their opinions on the issue of drafting and concluding a peace treaty with Germany. Since this is the case, why do the Western countries not support this proposal? We hope to clarify in this regard what the real situation is and what the real position of the Western countries is.

U.S. Secretary of State Herter, following Gromyko, said that before it is possible to give a considered answer to the questions raised by Gromyko, it is very important to obtain the Soviet delegation's answer to the questions raised by De Murville. The U.S. Secretary of State said during his explanation that the Soviet proposal for an All-German Committee took the conference by surprise.

Gromyko then replied to the questions from the Western representatives. He said: We have repeatedly explained to our negotiating counterparts that there is a necessary and not an artificial connection between the West Berlin issue and the issue of the All-German Committee and its work. The issue of the All-German Committee arose when discussing the West Berlin issue and the peace treaty issue. Therefore, this is not the first time we have raised this issue during the course of this conference. If there is an attempt to portray the situation as if we suddenly raised this issue, then this attempt is groundless.

Gromyko then spoke about the necessary and important connection between these two issues. He said that if positive results are achieved in the All-German Committee due to the two Germanys holding negotiations on the peaceful settlement of the German issue and the peace treaty with Germany, then it would be possible to conclude a peace treaty with Germany, and the conclusion of the peace treaty would mean resolving the Berlin issue, or more precisely, resolving the West Berlin issue. Who can deny this? We have repeatedly emphasized this point and tried to make our statements in this regard completely clear. The repeated statements by Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Khrushchev convincingly illustrate this point. Gromyko continued, I hope that after this explanation, we will receive answers and explanations to the questions we have raised. Naturally, we are very interested in these answers.

Gromyko also answered the question: Does the Soviet Union's proposal for the All-German Committee mean that the Soviet delegation is in some way raising the issue of discussing the German issue as a whole, including the issue of German reunification? Gromyko said: I think there can only be one answer to this question: no, this is not the case. If we were to discuss the issue of German reunification, which must be discussed by the Germans themselves, it would mean holding fruitless talks, which we believe is not in everyone's interest. As for the issue of signing a peace treaty, we are ready to discuss it at any time, because the importance of signing a peace treaty has not diminished, but is constantly increasing.

After Gromyko's speech, De Murville and Lloyd spoke again. However, they evaded answering the clear questions raised by the head of the Soviet delegation. In order to cover up their attempt to obstruct the conference from discussing the proposal to establish an All-German Committee, they began to raise new false "questions," insisting that they still had doubts about these issues.

Gromyko emphasized that the purpose of our proposal to establish the All-German Committee is precisely: the Four Powers should help the Germans begin negotiations among themselves to consider issues related to Germany. We know that the Western countries have different views on this issue. They want to control the issues related to Germany in their own hands, while these issues are precisely those that only the Germans themselves are qualified to consider and resolve. The proposals of the Western three Foreign Ministers regarding referendums and the tasks of the All-German Committee are due to their desire to control the consideration and resolution of issues that only the Germans are qualified to handle in their own hands. We cannot agree to such a proposal, because the purpose of this proposal is to infringe on the rights of the German people and is incompatible with the basic requirements of justice and respect for the rights of the German people.

After the parties continued to express some opinions on the issues under discussion, the meeting adjourned.

The Foreign Ministers agreed that the next plenary session would be held at 3:30 p.m. on July 16.

### 美英法外长在日内瓦会议上故意打岔  葛罗米柯点破西方的阻挠手法

    美英法外长在日内瓦会议上故意打岔
    葛罗米柯点破西方的阻挠手法
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：外长会议复会后第二次全体会议在15日举行，由法国外交部长德姆维尔担任主席。
    德姆维尔以法国代表的身份首先在会上发言。他说，外长会议无疑将讨论苏联在6月19日提出的建议，但是他希望能得到关于这些建议的某些解释。
    德姆维尔没有评论苏联6月19日的建议，而是向苏联代表团提出这样一个问题：为什么苏联这个建议不仅提到柏林问题，而且规定要建立一个全德委员会。他说，这就使得会议又要回头讨论整个德国问题。
    德姆维尔发言后，由葛罗米柯发言。他说，我们已经提醒注意这样一个事实：直到目前为止，西方各国代表团对苏联政府提出的关于西柏林临时地位和全德委员会的最新建议还没有给予任何明确的答复。葛罗米柯问道：我们想知道，这是为什么？美英法三国代表团在会议开始时赞成成立全德委员会，而当苏联建议成立这样一个委员会，规定它的任务，并把这个问题放在实际可行的基础上的时候，它们反而对这一主张表示冷淡，这又该怎样来评价呢？法国代表所作的解释并不能消除这个问题。我们还想知道，西方三国代表团是否同意：德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国双方在全德委员会中的代表应该享有同等的权利和同等的机会，在这个委员会中，应该通过双方协议的办法来解决问题。如果西方三国继续反对这一点，那就请它们给我们解释，如果西方国家反对这样一种局面，即参加委员会的任何一方代表在作出决定时都不享有特权地位的时候，它们害怕什么呢？如果预先给予双方中的一方以比另一方更为有利的条件，那么这算是什么样的谈判机构呢？
    葛罗米柯说，西方国家的代表一再说，不应当强迫德国接受和约。大家知道，这正是苏联政府一直坚持的立场。正因为如此，苏联才建议成立全德委员会，由德国人来拟定他们对有关草拟和缔结对德和约问题的意见。既然如此，西方国家为什么不支持这个建议呢？我们希望在这方面弄清楚，什么是真实情况，什么是西方国家的真正立场。
    美国国务卿赫脱继葛罗米柯之后发言说，在可能对葛罗米柯提出的问题作出经过考虑的答复之前，十分重要的是获得苏联代表团对于德姆维尔提出的问题的答复。美国国务卿在进行解释的时候说，苏联提出全德委员会的问题使会议感到意外。
    葛罗米柯接着答复了西方国家代表的问题。他说：我们曾经向我们的谈判对方一再解释过，西柏林问题同全德委员会及其工作的问题之间有必然的而不是人为的联系。在讨论西柏林问题与和约问题的时候，就出现了全德委员会的问题，因此，我们在这个会议的过程中并不是第一次提出这个问题。如果企图把事情说成是仿佛我们突如其来地提出这个问题，那么，这个企图是毫无根据的。
    葛罗米柯接着谈到了这两个问题之间的必然和重要联系。他说，如果由于两个德国就和平解决德国问题和对德和约问题举行谈判而在全德委员会中取得积极的结果，那末就有可能缔结对德和约，而缔结和约就意味着解决柏林问题，或者更确切地说，解决西柏林问题，谁能否认这一点呢？我们曾一再强调这点，并且设法使我们在这方面的声明变得完全清楚。苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫屡次发表的声明令人信服地说明了这一点。葛罗米柯接着说，我希望，在经过这次解释后，我们将得到对我们所提出的问题的回答和解释。十分自然，这些回答是我们所非常感兴趣的。
    葛罗米柯还回答这样的问题：苏联提出全德委员会的建议是否意味着这样苏联代表团就以某种方式提出了把包括德国统一问题在内的德国问题作为一个整体加以讨论的问题？葛罗米柯说：我认为，对这个问题只能有一个答复：不，这是不行的。如果讨论必须由德国人自己去讨论的德国统一问题，将意味着举行毫无结果的会谈，我们认为，这是不符合大家的利益的。至于签订和约问题，我们随时准备加以讨论，因为签订和约问题的重要性不但没有减少，而且在不断增加。
    在葛罗米柯发言之后，德姆维尔和劳埃德再一次发言。然而，他们规避答复苏联代表团团长提出的明确问题。为了掩盖他们阻挠会议讨论成立全德委员会的建议的企图，他们开始提出新的虚假的“问题”，硬说他们对这种问题仍然有怀疑。
    葛罗米柯强调指出，我们提出建立全德委员会的建议的目的恰恰就是：四大国应当帮助德国人开始他们自己中间的谈判来考虑跟德国有关的问题。我们知道，西方国家在这个问题上有不同的观点。他们想把跟德国有关的问题掌握在自己的手里，而这些问题恰恰是只有德国人自己才有资格考虑并解决的。西方三国外长所提出的关于公民投票和全德委员会的任务的建议是由于他们希望把只有德国人有资格处理的问题的考虑和解决掌握在自己手里。我们不能同意这样的建议，因为这种建议的目的是侵犯德国人民的权利，是同正义和尊重德国人民的权利的基本要求不相容的。
    在各方就讨论中的问题继续发表了一些意见以后，会议休会。
    外长们同意下次全体会议在7月16日十五时三十分举行。
