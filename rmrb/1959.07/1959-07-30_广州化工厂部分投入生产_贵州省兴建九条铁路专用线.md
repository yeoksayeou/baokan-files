Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 29th – The caustic soda, electrolysis, hydrochloric acid, and bleaching powder workshops of the newly built Guangzhou Chemical Plant have partially begun production recently. After these projects are put into production, they can produce 36 tons of caustic soda and more than 180 tons of hydrochloric acid per month.

Guangzhou originally had a very weak chemical industry foundation, producing only a few hundred tons of caustic soda and hydrochloric acid a year. When all the projects of this chemical plant are completed, it will change the situation of insufficient supply of caustic soda and hydrochloric acid in Guangdong Province.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 29th – Six of the nine railway spur lines built in Guizhou Province have been completed, and the remaining three are under accelerated construction.

These nine railway spur lines range in length from more than ten kilometers to only about one kilometer. They are all built to support current industrial construction and accelerate material transportation. The spur line from Chaohu near Guiyang to the Lindai area, which is 7.3 kilometers long, serves the coal mine being built here. After the construction of this spur line, it can ensure the timely transportation of coal needed by Guiyang City.

    广州化工厂部分投入生产
    贵州省兴建九条铁路专用线
    新华社广州29日电　新建广州化工厂的烧碱、电解、盐酸、漂白粉等四个车间，部分工程在最近开始投入生产。这些工程投入生产后，每月能生产烧碱三十六吨，盐酸一百八十多吨。
    广州市原来化学工业基础很薄弱，一年才生产烧碱和盐酸几百吨。这个化工厂的全部工程建成后，将改变广东省烧碱和盐酸供应不足的现象。
    新华社贵阳29日电　贵州省兴修的九条铁路专用线有六条已经完工，其余三条正在加速建设。
    这九条铁路专用线长的有十多公里，短的只有一公里左右，都是为支援当前工业建设和加速物资运输修建的。从贵阳附近的潮湖通到林歹地区的专用线，长七点三公里，是为这里正在建设的煤矿服务的。这条专用线修建后，能保证及时运输贵阳市需用的煤炭。
