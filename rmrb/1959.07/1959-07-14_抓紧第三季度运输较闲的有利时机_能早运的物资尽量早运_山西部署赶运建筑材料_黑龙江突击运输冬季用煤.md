According to the Shanxi Daily, the Logistics Office of the Shanxi Provincial Steel and Coal Joint Command recently convened a provincial conference on the transportation of mine construction materials (mineral building materials, such as lime, slate, gravel, sand, bricks, tiles, refractory bricks, etc.), non-metallic ores, and cement materials at the Taiyuan Railway Bureau. The meeting determined that during the third quarter, efforts should be made to produce and transport more of the aforementioned materials to avoid an excessively strained transportation situation in the fourth quarter. Participants included personnel from major mine construction material production factories and mines, material-using units, railway stations, and planning and construction departments of the provincial, special district, and municipal people's committees. After reviewing the production, material-using, and transportation plans for mine construction and other materials for the second half of the year, the meeting analyzed the current transportation situation. The meeting concluded that with coal accounting for over 72% of the province's total railway freight volume, the major coal mines are currently preparing for even greater high-quality, high-yield production, which is expected to result in a significant increase in production and transportation in the fourth quarter, making the third quarter a relatively slack period for transportation. If this opportunity can be seized to transport as much mine construction and other materials as possible in advance, it will not only avoid the transportation strain caused by freight congestion in the fourth quarter but also greatly benefit the production factories and mines and the using units of mine construction and other materials. After discussion, the comrades present unanimously agreed that making every effort to transport mine construction and other materials in advance during the third quarter is indeed a golden opportunity that should not be easily missed.

After analyzing the situation and unifying understanding, the meeting focused on studying the existing problems in current production and transportation work and made the following arrangements for organizing advance transportation: (1) Quickly arrange the production, transportation, and construction material preparation plans for mine construction materials in advance. Strive to transport more in July, and the transportation volume in August and September must not be lower than that in July. (2) Strengthen the short-distance handling capacity at various production sites to ensure quick loading and transportation. When necessary, the material-using units should provide some transportation tools to assist in rush transportation. (3) Mine construction material production units should increase certain loading equipment according to the increase in output and build more high platforms, etc., to improve loading efficiency. (4) Because the loading and unloading of mine construction materials is relatively concentrated, the speed of unloading directly affects whether more can be loaded in advance. Therefore, all material-using units must strengthen the organization of unloading work to ensure that vehicles are unloaded upon arrival to avoid stockpiling of freight cars. (5) The railway department must strengthen freight and traffic flow organization and organize balanced delivery and loading of vehicles according to plans, freight sources, and the equipment characteristics of production units.

According to this newspaper, in order to seize the favorable opportunity of relatively idle transportation and prepare early for urban heating and cooking coal for the coming winter and spring, relevant departments in Heilongjiang Province have taken various effective measures to rush the transportation of winter coal. This not only allows for the early storage of winter coal but also avoids excessive congestion in transportation in the fourth quarter.

The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Committee have recently held several special meetings to study and arrange coal production, distribution, and transportation work and have established a coal rush transportation office. In early June, the Provincial Department of Commerce and the Department of Fuel Industry sent many cadres to the mining areas to understand coal production and arrange transportation. Various regions have also taken urgent measures to rush coal transportation. The Hegang Special District transferred 247 cars, horse carts, and handcarts and more than 450 laborers from Jiamusi, Tangyuan, Jixian, Huachuan, and Fujin to Shuangyashan and Hegang to participate in coal transportation. By the end of June, they had transported more than 12,000 tons of coal. The Nenjiang and Songhua River Special Districts dispatched more than 280 vehicles of various types to rush coal transportation. The manager of the Mudanjiang City Coal, Building Materials, and Timber Supply Station personally organized 24 horse carts and 84 handcarts to transport coal to the Laodaogou Mine in Jixi. By the end of June, they had transported more than 10,000 tons. Coal mines and railway departments also actively participated in this work. The railway transportation department, based on the principle of prioritizing long distances over short distances, large quantities over small quantities, and easy tasks over difficult tasks, increased the number of allocated vehicles from 200 to 649 per day, starting on July 6, thereby increasing the transportation volume.

While rushing to transport coal from state-owned coal mines, various regions have strengthened the acquisition and transportation of coal from local small kilns. Under the leadership of the Party committee, the Mishan County Coal, Building Materials, and Timber Supply Station actively excavated 11 vehicles from various sources and adopted a shift work method to transport small kiln coal day and night. More than 12,000 tons have now been transported.

In order to load and unload coal in a timely manner and do a good job in storage, commercial departments in various regions have equipped sufficient loading and unloading workers, prepared sites and tools, and rushed to load and unload coal, accelerating the turnover of freight cars. In the distribution of coal, the principle of prioritizing large and medium-sized cities over general towns and long distances over short distances was implemented. Many large cities have also launched winter coal pre-collection and large-scale direct transportation methods. The Harbin City commercial department has signed contracts with various agencies and enterprises for partial winter coal pre-collection, and various units have transported back more than 50,000 tons.

  　抓紧第三季度运输较闲的有利时机
    能早运的物资尽量早运
    山西部署赶运建筑材料　黑龙江突击运输冬季用煤
    据山西日报消息　山西省钢煤联合指挥部后勤办公室，最近在太原铁路管理局召开全省矿建材料（矿物性的建筑材料，如石灰、板石、石子、沙子、砖瓦、耐火砖等）、非金属矿石，水泥材料运输会议，确定要在第三季度内，抓紧时机多产多运上述物资，以免第四季度出现运输过分紧张的局面。参加会议的有全省各主要矿建材料生产厂矿、用料单位、铁路车站和省、专、市各级人民委员会的计划、建设部门的人员。会议在核对了今年下半年矿建等材料的生产和用料运输计划之后，对当前运输形势作了分析。会议认为：占全省铁路总运量72％以上的煤炭货源，由于目前各大煤矿正为今后更大的优质高产作准备，预计在第四季度内将出现一个较大的高产增运局面，而第三季度则是一个运输较闲的空隙。如果能够抓紧这个时机，尽量提前多运矿建等材料，不仅可以避免第四季度因货源拥挤而造成运输紧张的现象，而且对矿建等材料的生产厂矿和使用单位也有很大好处。到会同志经过讨论，一致认为，第三季度能够尽量使矿建等材料提前多运，的确是个不能轻易放弃的大好机会。
    会议在分析形势，统一认识以后，着重研究了当前生产与运输工作中存在的问题，并对组织提前运输作了以下安排：（一）迅速提前安排好矿建材料的产、运与施工备料计划。7月份力争多运，8、9两月份的运量一定要不低于7月份。（二）加强各生产现场的小搬运能力，保证快装快运。必要时，用料单位应支援一部分运输工具，协助突击运搬。（三）矿建材料生产单位应根据产量的增加而增加一定的装车设备，多修高站台等，提高装车效率。（四）因矿建材料装卸比较集中，卸车的快慢直接关系着能否提前多装，因此，各用料单位要加强卸车组织工作，做到车到就卸，以免积压车皮。（五）铁路部门要加强货运和车流组织工作，要按计划、按货源、按生产单位的设备特点来组织均衡送车和装车。
    本报讯　为了抓紧当前运输比较空闲的有利时机，提早准备今冬明春城镇取暖和炊事用煤，黑龙江省有关部门采取各种有效措施，突击抢运冬季用煤。这样不仅可以提早储备冬季用煤，而且可以避免第四季度运输过分拥挤。
    中共黑龙江省委和黑龙江省人民委员会最近曾多次召开专门会议，研究和安排煤炭的生产、分配和调运工作，并成立了煤炭突击调运办公室。6月初，省商业厅和燃料工业厅曾派出许多干部深入各矿区了解煤炭的生产情况，安排调运。各个地区也都采取了紧急措施突击运煤。合江专区从佳木斯、汤原、集贤、桦川、富锦等地抽调了汽车、马车、手推车二百四十七辆，劳动力四百五十多名，到双鸭山、鹤岗参加煤炭运输工作，到6月末已运出煤炭一万二千多吨。嫩江和松花江两个专区抽出了各种车辆二百八十多台突击运煤。牡丹江市煤建木材供应站经理亲自出马，组织了马车二十四辆和手推车八十四辆，到鸡西老道沟矿运煤，到6月末已运出一万多吨。各煤矿和铁路部门也积极参加了这项工作。铁路运输部门本着先远后近、先多后少、先易后难的原则，从7月6日开始，每天配车数由过去的二百车增加到六百四十九车，增加了调运量。
    各地在突击调运国家煤矿的煤炭的同时，加强了对各地小窑煤的收购和调运工作。密山县煤建木材供应站在党委领导下，积极从各方面挖掘出十一台汽车，采取轮班作业的办法，昼夜突击运输小窑煤，现在已运出一万二千多吨。
    为了及时装卸煤炭和做好储备工作，各地商业部门配备了充足的装卸工人，准备了场地和工具，突击装卸煤炭，加速了车皮周转。在煤炭的分配上，贯彻了先大中城市，后一般城镇，先远后近的原则。许多大城市还开展了冬季用煤的预取和大搞直线运输的办法。哈尔滨市商业部门已和各机关企业签订了部分冬季用煤预取合同，各单位已运回五万多吨。
