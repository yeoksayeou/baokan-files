Xinhua News Agency, 6th, Trujillo City Dispatch: While the Dominican dictatorship is making false accusations to the US-controlled Organization of American States (OAS) Council against Cuba and Venezuela for "invading" Dominica, it is preparing military provocations against Cuba and other countries to create a pretext for US intervention.

It is reported that the Dominican dictatorship, under the pretext of so-called "preventing military offensives from home and abroad," has placed the entire country under military alert. In the past three weeks, large numbers of reinforcements have been dispatched to the Dominican-Haitian border region and the 2,000-mile coastline. The mountainous border areas of Dominica are also filled with troops and civilian guards. The Dominican Navy, including two destroyers, three fast ships, five light cruisers, and some smaller vessels, is patrolling the waters between Dominica and Haiti.

To prepare for open military provocations, the Dominican government is intensifying the organization of a so-called "anti-communist foreign legion," which includes followers of the Spanish dictator Franco and Nazis. It is said that this legion will receive regular army training and will be commanded by retired Dominican officers.

Dominican officials stated that "security measures" have been strengthened in the capital and other areas, and many opponents have been arrested.

    为美国干涉古巴制造借口
    多米尼加政府准备挑衅
    新华社6日讯  特鲁希略城消息：多米尼加独裁政府在向美国控制的“美洲国家组织”理事会诬控古巴、委内瑞拉“入侵”多米尼加的同时，正在准备对古巴等国的军事挑衅，以为美国的干涉制造借口。
    据报道，多米尼加独裁政权以所谓“防止国内外的军事进攻”为名，已把整个国家置于军事戒备之下。在最近三星期，有大批增援部队被派到多米尼加和海地接壤地区以及长达两千英里的海岸线上。多米尼加边境山区也充满了军队和民间警卫队。包括两只驱逐舰、三只快速舰、五只轻巡洋舰和一些小型船只的多米尼加海军正在多米尼加和海地之间的海面进行巡逻。
    为了准备进行公开的军事挑衅，多米尼加政府正在加紧组织所谓“反共外国军团”，这个军团包括西班牙独裁者佛朗哥的随从和纳粹分子。据说这个军团将接受常备军的训练，并将由多米尼加退伍军官指挥。
    多米尼加官方表示，在首都和其他地区都加强了“安全措施”，并且已经逮捕了许多反对者。
