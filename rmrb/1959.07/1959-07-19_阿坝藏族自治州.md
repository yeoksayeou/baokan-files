Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture

On the northwest edge of the Sichuan Basin, countless magnificent snow-capped mountains stand tall. Behind the snow-capped mountains lies a vast and flat grassland. This is where the Red Army passed during the Long March. The Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan Province is located in this area.

The Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture was established in 1952, with its capital in Barkam (Ma'erkang). The entire prefecture has a population of over 520,000, including 210,000 Tibetans, and the remainder being Qiang, Hui, and Han nationalities. The Qiang and Hui people residing within the autonomous prefecture have also established the Maowen Qiang Autonomous County and the Aba Hui Township in Aba County.

The autonomous prefecture covers an area of approximately 80,000 square kilometers, equivalent to the size of Austria.

This is the northeastern end of the Kham-Tibet Plateau. Rivers crisscross the territory, and the Yellow River flows along the northern edge. The main tributaries of the Yangtze River, the Min River and the Dadu River, both originate here. In the southeastern part of the autonomous prefecture, mountains are densely clustered, with the highest peaks rising more than 5,000 meters above sea level, covered with snow all year round. Beyond the snow-capped mountains lies an endless expanse of grassland.

The Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture is extremely rich in natural resources. It has various metal mineral deposits such as gold, silver, copper, iron, aluminum, and zinc. The iron ore deposits in the Songpan County area have been proven to have reserves of approximately 290 million tons. The mining sites of non-metal mineral deposits such as asbestos, mica, quartz, Iceland spar, and beryl are also increasing.

The autonomous prefecture is full of dense primitive forests, covering an area of 2.2 million hectares, accounting for one-fourth of the forest area of Sichuan Province. The timber reserves are 250 million cubic meters.

The hundreds of rivers and streams in the autonomous prefecture have enormous power generation potential. The power generation capacity of the Min River and its tributaries alone can reach about 27.9 billion kilowatt-hours per year, equivalent to the power generation of five Sanmenxia hydropower stations.

In most areas of the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, the climate is mild, and the soil is fertile, suitable for the growth of crops. It is rich in wheat, corn, highland barley, vegetables, and various beans. Some areas also produce rice. On the vast grasslands, the water and grass are lush, making it an excellent place to develop animal husbandry.

    阿坝藏族自治州
    在四川盆地的西北部边缘，耸立着无数雄伟壮丽的雪山。雪山后面，是辽阔平坦的大草原。这是当年红军长征时经过的雪山草地。四川省阿坝藏族自治州就在这个地方。
    阿坝藏族自治州是1952年成立的，首府在马尔康。全州共有五十二万多人，其中藏族二十一万人，其余为羌、回、汉族。居住在自治州境内的羌族和回族人民，也建立了茂汶羌族自治县和阿坝县中阿坝回族乡。
    自治州的面积约八万平方公里，相当于一个奥地利。
    这里是康藏高原东北的尾部。境内河流纵横，黄河自北部边缘流过。长江的主要支流岷江和大渡河均发源于此。自治州东南部，群山丛错，最高的山峰拔海在五千米以上，终年积雪不化。越过雪山，是一望无际的大草原。
    阿坝藏族自治州物产资源非常丰富。金、银、铜、铁、铝、锌等金属矿藏样样都有，松潘县一带的铁矿已查明储量约达二亿九千万吨左右，石棉、云母、水晶石、冰州石、绿柱石等非金属矿藏的矿点，也日益增多。
    自治州到处都是遮天蔽日的原始森林，面积达二百二十万公顷，占四川省森林面积的四分之一。木材积蓄量二亿五千万立方米。
    自治州大小数百条河流和溪沟，都有巨大的发电能力。仅岷江及其支流的发电能力即可达年发电二百七十九亿度左右，相当于五个三门峡水电站的发电量。
    阿坝藏族自治州大部分地区，气候温和，土地肥沃，适宜农作物生长。盛产小麦、玉米、青稞、蔬菜和各种豆类。有些地方还出产水稻。在辽阔的草原上，水草丰美，是发展畜牧业的大好场所。
