    Specifically Help Grassroots Cadres
    Yi Qing
    After the rural people's communes implemented unified leadership and management at different levels, the leadership responsibility of rural grassroots Party organizations became even more significant, and the work tasks became more arduous. Faced with this new situation, many county and district Party committees have further strengthened their leadership over rural grassroots Party organizations, specifically helping grassroots cadres to improve their leadership skills, thereby fully发挥[fā huī]ing the role of grassroots Party organizations as fighting fortresses. The Chaoyang District Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China adopted the method of training Party members, allocating key personnel, and tightening control at all levels to strengthen the leadership of rural branches and improve the leadership level of grassroots cadres, so that most of the branches in this district played their due role in political and ideological leadership.
      Practical experience tells us that in order for rural grassroots Party organizations to play a leading role in rural work, county and district Party committees must first attach importance to grassroots organizations and establish the view of relying on grassroots organizations and leading rural work through grassroots organizations. The important issue is to help grassroots cadres improve their leadership skills. Through several years of practical work, especially the exercise of the Great Leap Forward last year, the ideological awareness of many rural grassroots cadres has been greatly improved, and their work ability and leadership level have also been correspondingly improved. Many county and district Party committees rely on them to do a good job in the political and ideological leadership of the Party in rural areas. Of course, the leadership level of these grassroots cadres is, in many cases, still unable to meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward situation. In particular, some cadres were newly selected during the Great Leap Forward last year. They are loyal to the Party's cause and enthusiastic, but lack practical experience in Party work and even lack basic knowledge of the Party, and must be given good help. How to help them? Should higher-level cadres be sent down to replace them in leading rural work, or should their leadership be strengthened to improve their leadership skills? Adopting the latter approach may solve the problem.
    Rural work has always had to rely on grassroots cadres to do it well. Because grassroots cadres are directly connected with the masses and specifically implement the Party's policies and policies in rural areas. Therefore, relying on them to do the work can make the work better. After the communization, problems in rural work are changing with each passing day and are complex and diverse. Many problems are very specific and meticulous, which requires grassroots cadres who are familiar with the local situation and have close ties with the local people to implement specific and daily leadership. Cadres sent down by higher authorities must avoid "doing everything for them" and earnestly help grassroots cadres do their work.
    Judging from the experience of the Chaoyang District Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee in training cadres, allocating cadres, and tightening control at all levels, the work ability and leadership level of grassroots cadres can be improved. Because work ability and leadership level are not absolute. As long as the county and district Party committees strengthen leadership, take various measures, give them specific help and education, and let them be trained in the process of work and study, their work ability and leadership level can be gradually improved, and the core leadership role of the Party's grassroots organizations can be fully发挥[fā huī]ed. It can be seen that with the strong help of the higher-level Party committees, the rural Party branches will surely be able to further发挥[fā huī] the great role of fighting fortresses.

    具体帮助基层干部
    怡清
    农村人民公社实行统一领导、分级管理后，农村基层党组织的领导责任更加重大了，工作任务更加艰巨了。面对这一新的情况，不少县、区党委进一步加强了对农村基层党组织的领导，具体帮助基层干部提高领导水平，从而充分发挥了基层党组织的战斗堡垒作用。中共北京市朝阳区委采取了训练党员、配备骨干、层层抓紧的办法，加强了对农村支部的领导，提高了基层干部的领导水平，就使这个区的大部分支部发挥了应有的政治思想的领导作用。
      实践经验告诉我们：要农村基层党组织发挥农村工作的领导作用，县、区党委首先要重视基层组织，树立依靠基层组织、通过基层组织领导农村工作的观点。重要的问题，则是帮助基层干部提高领导水平。许多农村基层干部经过几年来实际工作的锻炼，特别是去年大跃进的锻炼，思想觉悟有了很大提高，工作能力和领导水平也有相应的提高。不少县、区党委依靠他们作好了农村党的政治思想领导工作。当然，这些基层干部的领导水平，很多还不能适应大跃进形势的需要。特别是有些干部是在去年大跃进中新选拔起来的。他们对党的事业忠心耿耿，热情积极，但缺少党的工作的实际经验，甚至缺少党的基础知识，必须很好地加以帮助。怎么帮助呢？是上级派干部下去代替他们领导农村工作呢，还是加强对他们的领导，从而提高他们的领导水平呢？采取后一种办法，就有可能解决问题。
    农村工作从来就要依靠基层干部去做，才能做好。因为基层干部直接联系群众，而且具体贯彻执行党在农村的方针、政策。所以，依靠他们去做工作，就能够把工作做得更好。公社化以后，农村工作中的问题日新月异，复杂多样，许多问题非常具体细致，这就更需要熟悉当地情况、与当地群众有密切联系的基层干部实行具体的、日常的领导。上级派下去的干部，必须避免“包办代替”，认真帮助基层干部作工作。
    从北京市朝阳区委训练干部、配备干部和层层抓紧的经验来看，基层干部的工作能力和领导水平是可以提高的。因为工作能力和领导水平并不是绝对的。只要县、区党委加强领导，采取各种各样办法，给他们以具体帮助和教育，让他们在工作和学习的过程中得到锻炼，他们的工作能力和领导水平就有可能逐步提高，党的基层组织的核心领导作用也就能够充分发挥。可以看到，农村党支部在上级党委的大力帮助下，一定能够进一步发挥战斗堡垒的巨大作用。
