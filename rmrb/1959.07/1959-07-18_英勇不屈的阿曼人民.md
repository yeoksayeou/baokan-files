The indomitable people of Oman

Luo Erzhuang

In July 1957, the banner of resistance against aggression was raised on the land of Oman. To this day, this banner has been flying for a full three years. During this period, the Omani people have carried out an unyielding struggle for the independence and liberation of their motherland. They stood firm in the smoke and fire sea spread by British imperialism, and resolutely and decisively gave the invaders a heavy blow.

Oman is located in the southeast of the Arabian Peninsula, including the Imamate of Oman and the Sultanate of Muscat. In order to occupy this country, which borders the Arabian Sea to the east, controls the mouth of the Persian Gulf to the north, has important strategic significance, and possesses infinite treasures, British imperialism stretched out its aggressive claws to Oman as early as the end of the eighteenth century, frequently forcing the Sultan of Muscat to sign various enslaving treaties, and using the Sultan of Muscat, who had defected to the enemy and sought glory through subservience, as a tool to carry out strict control and cruel enslavement of the entire territory of Oman. However, the Omani people have been fighting bravely for national independence and freedom, one after another. In 1913, under the leadership of the Imam of the Omani mountains, the Omani people raised the torch of uprising and announced the establishment of the Islamic Imamate of Oman with Nizwa as its capital. The strong will of the Omani people forced Britain to agree to the "Treaty of Seeb" signed by its lackey, the Sultan of Muscat, and the Imam of Oman, recognizing Oman's complete autonomy and independence.

However, colonialism is about plunder and enslavement. In 1949, after rich oil reserves were discovered near the Buraimi Oasis in the Imamate of Oman, British imperialism once again revealed its jackal nature in order to occupy the Buraimi Oasis. Britain instigated the Sultan of Muscat to tear up the "Treaty of Seeb," and in November 1955, the Sultan of Muscat's army, commanded by British officers, launched an attack on the Imamate of Oman, forcibly occupied Nizwa, the capital of Oman, and other places, and arrogantly announced its "ruling sovereignty" over Oman in February 1957.

However, the Omani people did not succumb to pressure. When the Imam of Oman was forced into exile, he still solemnly declared on behalf of the Omani people that they would never stop fighting for the freedom and independence of their motherland.

In July 1957, a large-scale uprising against Britain and its puppets finally broke out in the Omani mountains, shaking the mountains and rivers. The insurgents defeated the invaders entrenched on their territory like a hot knife through butter, and once recovered Nizwa and many other areas. British imperialism therefore openly and directly dispatched its troops, using all kinds of modern weapons to frantically slaughter the Omani people. After a month of fierce fighting, the Omani insurgent forces took the initiative to withdraw from Nizwa, moved to the Green Mountain area, and ignited the flames of a protracted war of resistance from then on.

For three years, in order to destroy the Omani people's will to fight for freedom and independence and maintain its remaining colonial rule in the Arab region, British imperialism has carried out appalling destruction and killings in Oman. British Venom jet fighters roared through the skies over Oman all day long, indiscriminately bombing and strafing; British tanks, spewing flames of death, constantly闯过Omani peaceful idyllic fields; the invaders not only used various cannons, napalm bombs, and rocket weapons against the Omani people, but also inhumanely violated international law, carrying out germ warfare in this country, which is economically backward and lacks doctors due to long-term plunder. As for the tragedies of arrests, kidnappings, "terrorist movements," rapes, arson, and killings created by the British invading army on the land of Oman, they occur daily and are everywhere.

British imperialism, with its wishful thinking of a quick victory, was confident that as long as it carried out large-scale brutal massacres in Oman, it could quickly make the Omani people submit. About a month after the outbreak of the anti-British uprising in Oman, British Prime Minister Macmillan, who was goose hunting in Yorkshire, England, triumphantly issued a communiqué, expressing "congratulations" on the "rapid achievements" of the British invading army's commander-in-chief and others in suppressing the Omani people, and "confidently" declared that the British army would soon return in triumph. At the same time, the British ruling Conservative Party's "Daily Telegraph" also clamored arrogantly that even if another month was used to "flatten the rebellion," it would be "too long." But in no time at all, their illusions had been completely shattered in the face of the Omani people's heroic resistance. The remake of the "gunboat policy" – the "three-stage plan" from distributing intimidating leaflets to using ground troops to carry out massacres – has also completely failed. Although the British army has increased from thousands of people and a small number of aircraft at the beginning of the war to 100,000 people and more than 1,000 aircraft, they have not only failed to win the war in about a month, but have also fallen into a more passive and desperate state in the third year after the outbreak of the war. And the Omani insurgents, who were initially poorly equipped, even with only some sabers and sticks, have grown and strengthened through long-term war and armed themselves with a large number of weapons seized from the enemy, becoming a formidable force.

In the Omani people's struggle for freedom and independence, the United States has consistently used two-faced tactics to carry out conspiracies. On the one hand, it provides ammunition and equipment to support Britain in suppressing the Omani people, and has reached a robber agreement with Britain to give Oman's management rights to Britain and oil exploitation rights to the United States; on the other hand, it is trying its best to take advantage of the Omani war to squeeze out Britain and expand its influence in the Middle East. Therefore, the United States has always refused the Omani people's appeals for support and has colluded with Britain in the United Nations to reject the Arab countries' proposal to include the Omani issue on the agenda. The Omani people have realized through their own experience that American imperialism and British imperialism are just birds of a feather.

The Omani people's heroic and tenacious struggle has been supported by socialist countries and righteous people all over the world from the very beginning. Recently, the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council passed a resolution condemning the British army's aggressive actions in Oman, calling for making July 18 this year a day of support for Oman, and requesting support for submitting the Omani issue to the next session of the United Nations. This call has been widely responded to by the people of China and other Asian and African countries.

At the beginning of this year, when Prince Harse, the Deputy Imam of Oman, visited our country, he firmly declared: "We have a strong will, and we will never lay down our weapons until the struggle wins the final victory." He also said with confidence and hope: "Dawn shines on the East with its dazzling light... The east wind sends the songs of happiness and peace of free mankind to all parts of the world." In this era of strong east wind and great light, the Omani people are advancing along with the irresistible torrent of national independence movements in Asian, African, and Latin American countries. Final victory must belong to the Omani people who persist in struggle.

    英勇不屈的阿曼人民
    罗尔庄
    1957年7月，在阿曼土地上升起了反抗侵略的旗帜，时至今日，这面旗帜已经整整地飘扬了三年。阿曼人民为了争取祖国的独立与解放，在这期间进行了不屈不挠的斗争。他们屹立在英帝国主义撒布的硝烟火海中，全力地坚决地给侵略者以沉重的回击。
    阿曼地处阿拉伯半岛的东南部，境内包括阿曼教长国和马斯喀特苏丹国。为了占领这个东濒阿拉伯海，北扼波斯湾口，具有重要战略意义而又拥有无限宝藏的国家，远在十八世纪的末叶，英帝国主义就野心勃勃地向阿曼伸出侵略的魔掌，经常逼迫马斯喀特苏丹签订种种奴役性条约，并利用投靠外敌，屈膝求荣的马斯喀特苏丹作工具，对阿曼全境进行严密的控制和残酷的奴役。但是，阿曼人民为了民族独立和自由，一直都在前仆后继地进行着英勇的斗争。1913年，在阿曼山区教长领导下，阿曼人民举起了起义的火把，宣布成立以尼兹瓦为首府的阿曼伊斯兰教长国。阿曼人民的坚强意志，迫使英国不得不同意由它豢养的走狗马斯喀特苏丹与阿曼教长签订了“西卜条约”，承认阿曼的完全自主与独立。
    但是，殖民主义就是掠夺与奴役。1949年，在阿曼教长国的布赖米绿洲附近发现了丰富的石油储藏后，为了占领布赖米绿洲，英帝国主义就再一次露出了它的豺狼本相。英国唆使马斯喀特苏丹撕毁了“西卜条约”，并在1955年11月由英国军官指挥马斯喀特苏丹的军队向阿曼教长国发动了进攻，强占了阿曼首府尼兹瓦等地，并狂妄地于1957年2月宣布它对阿曼的
  “统治主权”。
    但是，阿曼人民并没有在压力下屈服。阿曼教长在被迫流亡国外的时候，仍然代表阿曼人民庄严地宣布，阿曼人民决不停止争取祖国自由独立的斗争。
    1957年7月，在阿曼山区终于爆发了声震山河的反抗英国及其傀儡的大规模起义。起义人民势如破竹地击溃了盘据在它们领土上的侵略者，并一度收复了尼兹瓦和其他许多地区。英帝国主义因而公然直接出动了它的军队，以各种现代化武器疯狂地屠杀阿曼人民。在经过一个月的激战后，阿曼起义部队主动撤出尼兹瓦，转战于绿山地区，并从此燃起了长期抗战的烽火。
    三年来，英帝国主义为了摧毁阿曼人民争取自由的意志，保持它在阿拉伯地区残存的殖民统治，在阿曼进行了惨绝人寰的破坏与杀戮。英国的毒液式喷气飞机，带着疯狂的啸音整日飞掠于阿曼上空，滥施轰炸与扫射；英国的坦克，喷射着死亡的火焰，不断地闯过阿曼和平的田园；侵略者不仅对阿曼人民使用了各种大炮、凝固汽油弹和火箭武器，并且还惨无人道地违反了国际公法，在这个因长期遭受掠夺而经济落后、缺乏医生的国家里进行了细菌战。至于英国侵略军在阿曼土地上制造的逮捕、绑架“恐怖运动”和奸淫烧杀等等惨剧，就更是每日发生，比比皆是。
    英帝国主义打着速战速决的如意算盘，满以为只要在阿曼进行大规模的残暴屠杀，就可以迅速地使阿曼人民屈膝就范。阿曼反英起义爆发后约一个月，当时正在英国约克郡作打鹅游猎的英国首相麦克米伦就洋洋得意地发表了一项公报，对英国侵略军总司令等人镇压阿曼人民的“迅速成就”表示“祝贺”，并“满怀信心”地扬言英国军队将会很快地凯旋。与这同时，英国的执政党保守党的“每日电讯报”也气焰嚣张地叫嚷，即使再用一个月来“压平叛乱”也是为时“过久”。但是曾几何时，他们的幻梦在阿曼人民英勇的抗击面前已经彻底破灭了。“炮舰政策”的翻版——从散发威慑性传单到使用地面部队进行残杀的“三阶段计划”，也已经完全失灵。尽管英国军队已从战争开始时的数千人和少量飞机，增加到现在的十万人和超过一千架飞机，但是，它们不仅不能在一个月左右的时间赢得战争，而且已在战争爆发后的第三年，陷于比过去更加被动和绝望的状态。而开始时装备低劣，甚至是仅有一些腰刀、棍棒的阿曼起义者，却已经从长期的战火锻炼中成长壮大，以缴获敌人的大量武器来武装自己，成为一支劲旅。
    在阿曼人民争取自由独立的斗争中，美国一贯使用两面手法，进行阴谋活动。它一方面提供弹药和装备，支持英国镇压阿曼人民，与英国达成了把阿曼的管理权归英国，石油开采权归美国的强盗协议；另方面又极力乘阿曼战争之机排挤英国，扩张它在中东的势力。因此，美国一直拒绝阿曼人民要求支持的呼吁，并在联合国与英国串通一气，否决了阿拉伯国家将阿曼问题列入议程的提案。阿曼人民已经通过自己的切身体验，认识到美帝国主义与英帝国主义只不过是一丘之貉。
    阿曼人民进行的英勇顽强的斗争，一开始就得到了社会主义国家和全世界正义人民的同情和支持。最近，亚非人民团结理事会书记处通过决议，谴责英国军队在阿曼的侵略行为，号召把今年的7月18日作为支持阿曼的日子，并要求在把阿曼问题提交联合国下一届会议这方面支持阿曼。这个号召得到了中国和其他亚非国家人民的广泛响应。
    今年年初，阿曼副教长哈尔塞亲王在我国进行访问时，曾坚定地宣布：“我们有坚强的意志，如果斗争不获得最后的胜利，我们决不放下武器”。他还满怀信心和希望地说：“黎明用它耀眼的光芒照耀着东方……，东风把自由人类的幸福与和平的歌声送到世界各地”。在这东风劲吹，光芒万丈的时代，阿曼人民正随着不可抗拒的亚非各国、拉丁美洲各国民族独立运动的巨流前进。最后胜利一定属于坚持斗争的阿曼人民。
