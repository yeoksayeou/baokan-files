    Three Key Steps to Increase Flue-Cured Tobacco Production
    On May 17th, this newspaper published a commentary on the issue of increasing flue-cured tobacco production this year, which already discussed the importance of increasing tobacco production to support the country's cigarette industry and increase the income of farmers in tobacco-producing areas. The current question is what specific measures should be taken to increase the production of tobacco leaves.
    Currently, the transplanting of late-season tobacco is basically complete, and the focus has shifted to field management. The early-season tobacco has begun to be harvested and cured for the bottom leaves, and is about to enter the stage of large-scale harvesting and curing. This is the tense moment when the first hurdle (transplanting) has just been overcome, the second hurdle (field management) is not yet complete, and the third hurdle (curing) has arrived. At this critical juncture for increasing tobacco production, what measures should we take to win an even greater harvest of flue-cured tobacco? The main ones are the following three major tasks: vigorously cultivate second-crop tobacco, do a good job in organizing and leading curing work, and strengthen field management of late-season tobacco.
    Cultivating second-crop tobacco is an effective measure to increase production. This has been further confirmed in the Great Leap Forward in production in 1958. In Xuchang Prefecture, Henan, one of China's famous flue-cured tobacco producing areas, last year, the local practice of "hanging bayonets," that is, cultivating the stalks of the tobacco plants, generally yielded an additional ten to twenty leaves per plant. The yield of "bayonet tobacco" was equivalent to 30% to 50% of the yield of the first crop. Their experience proves that early-season tobacco can be topped in early July, and one or two "bayonets" can be left in mid-July. By early September, the "bayonet" tobacco can mature and be harvested and cured. Even in mid-August, after the "bayonet" tobacco has grown, the tobacco leaves that are "hung with bayonets" again can mature and be harvested and cured by the end of September. At the same time, according to some high-yield typical investigations: "Hanging bayonets" combined with cultivating bottom suckers after the first crop of tobacco has been cured on the upper two tiers yields even greater production results. It increased production by 42% compared to only "hanging bayonets," and increased production by 85% compared to only leaving bottom suckers. Some people are afraid that cultivating second-crop tobacco will affect wheat planting. From Henan's experience, the second crop of tobacco can be harvested by the end of September, which has no impact on wheat planting. Currently, it is an appropriate time to "hang bayonets" and cultivate second-crop tobacco. While actively imparting the technology of cultivating second-crop tobacco, mobilize the masses to vigorously accumulate fertilizer to solve the fertilizer problem for the second crop of tobacco. Enabling the vast majority of early-season tobacco and late-season tobacco on barley stubble to cultivate second-crop tobacco will be of great significance for increasing tobacco production this year.
    Whether the tobacco leaf curing work is done well is an important key to whether a bumper harvest can be achieved and whether the country can obtain high-quality tobacco leaves to promote the development of the cigarette industry. Therefore, all localities should attach great importance to the leadership of curing work. In addition to strengthening the imparting of curing technology, the key to improving curing quality is to strengthen the responsibility system for curing and implement reward methods to mobilize the production enthusiasm of the masses and give full play to the role of curing experts. It should be seen that tobacco leaf curing is a complex labor with high technical requirements. In order to improve curing quality and ensure the inherent quality of tobacco leaves, not only should the income of technical farmers engaged in curing work be differentiated from that of general farmers, but also some specific measures should be actively formulated in terms of "fixed personnel (fixed curing personnel)," "quality assurance (guaranteeing the grade of cured tobacco leaves)," and "super-quality rewards" to strengthen their sense of responsibility and give full play to their technical expertise. Only in this way can the quality of tobacco leaves be rapidly improved.
    Late-season tobacco accounts for a large proportion, and grasping and doing a good job in the field management of late-season tobacco is crucial to increasing tobacco production this year. Currently, the rainy season has arrived. According to the characteristics of insufficient fertilization of late-season tobacco fields this year, the focus of field management should be placed on cultivating and weeding tobacco fields, ridging and earthing up, and draining and preventing waterlogging to prevent tobacco plants from getting sick, fertilizer from being lost, and weeds from growing in tobacco fields. For topdressing late-season tobacco, we must adhere to the principle of using farm manure as the main source. We must seize the favorable conditions of vigorous growth of weeds during the rainy season and accumulate more green manure, and not sit and wait for the supply of commercial fertilizer, so as not to delay the appropriate time for topdressing.
    As long as the people's communes in all tobacco-producing areas conscientiously implement the above three production-increasing measures, it is certain that more and better tobacco leaves can be produced.

### 烤烟增产的三个环节

    烤烟增产的三个环节
    5月17日本报对今年烤烟增产问题发表过评论，已经论述了增产烤烟对支援国家卷烟工业生产，提高烟区农民收入的重要性。当前的问题是采取怎样的具体措施，增产更多的烟叶。
    目前晚烟移栽已经基本结束，转入田间管理；早烟开始收烤底脚叶，即将进入大收大烤阶段。正是所谓一关（移栽关）刚过，二关（田间管理关）未了，三关（烘烤关）已到的紧张关头。在这烤烟增产的紧要关头，我们应该采取一些什么措施，才能夺得烤烟的更大丰收呢？主要的有下面三件大事，即：大力培育二茬烟，作好烘烤的组织领导工作，加强晚烟的田间管理。
    培育二茬烟是一项有效的增产措施。这在1958年的生产大跃进中已经得到了进一步证实。我国烤烟著名产区之一——河南许昌专区，去年当地“挂刺刀”即培育烟株的烟楂，一般每株多收十到二十片烟叶。“刺刀烟”的产量相当头茬烟产量的30％到50％。他们的经验证明：早烟在7月初打顶，7月中旬留一到二个“刺刀”，到9月初旬“刺刀”烟即可成熟收烤。甚至在8月中旬“刺刀”烟长成后，再“挂刺刀”的烟叶，在9月底也可成熟收烤。同时根据一些丰产典型调查：“挂刺刀”结合在头茬烟收烤上二棚后，再培育底杈，增产的效果更大。比只“挂刺刀”的增产42％，比只留底杈的增产85％。有人怕培育二茬烟影响种麦、从河南的经验看，9月底就可收完二茬烟，对种麦一点影响也没有。当前正是“挂刺刀”培育二茬烟的适宜时期，在积极传授培育二茬烟技术的同时，发动群众大力积肥，解决二茬烟的肥料问题，使绝大部分早烟和大麦茬晚烟都能培育二茬烟，对今年烤烟增产是有巨大意义的。
    烟叶烘烤工作做得好坏，是关系丰产能否丰收和国家能否得到品质优良的烟叶，以促进卷烟工业发展的重要关键。因此，各地应该十分重视对烘烤工作的领导。提高烘烤质量的关键，除了加强烘烤技术的传授以外，还要加强烘烤的责任制和贯彻奖励办法，以调动群众的生产积极性和充分发挥烘烤能手的作用。应该看到：烟叶的烘烤是一项技术性较高的复杂劳动，为了提高烘烤质量，保证烟叶应有的品质，不仅应该使担任烘烤工作的技术农民的收入与一般农民有所区别，还要积极地从“定人（固定烘烤人员）”、
  “包质（包烤出烟叶的等级）”和“超质奖励”等方面制定一些具体办法，以加强其责任心，充分发挥其技术特长。只有这样，才能迅速提高烟叶品质。
    晚烟所占的比重较大，抓紧做好晚烟的田间管理，对今年烤烟增产至关重要。目前雨季已经到来。根据今年晚烟田施肥不足的特点，田间管理的重点应该放在烟田的中耕除草，起垅培土，排水防涝等工作上，以防止烟株发病，肥料流失和烟田发生草荒。对晚烟的追肥，必须坚持以农家肥料为主的方针，要抓紧雨季杂草生长旺盛的有利条件，多多积造绿肥，不能坐等商品肥料的供应，以致耽误追肥的适期。
    只要各产烟区的人民公社，认真贯彻执行以上三项增产措施，增产更多更好的烟叶，是一定能够实现的。
