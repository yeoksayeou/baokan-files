Xinhua News Agency, July 24th - Chemical industry departments in various regions are taking measures to increase fertilizer production to support agricultural production. According to statistics from the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the production of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers in various regions increased by about 20% in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year. Many chemical plant workers are exerting their utmost efforts to overcome difficulties and ensure increased fertilizer production.

    Dalian Chemical Plant is one of the best units in the country in terms of increasing fertilizer production. At the beginning of this year, the plant encountered the problem of insufficient power supply; however, by strengthening scheduling and conscientiously implementing electricity-saving measures, the plant saved 4.35 million kilowatt-hours of electricity in the first quarter, ensuring the completion of the ammonium sulfate production plan. In the second quarter, the power supply situation improved, and the workers, through deeply launching a socialist labor emulation campaign for high quality and high output, overcame many weak links and created conditions for increased production. For example, due to the insufficient supply of sulfuric acid at the time, which seriously affected nitrogen fertilizer production, the workers adopted methods such as improving the proportion of ore blending, increasing the daily production of dilute sulfuric acid by more than 70 tons, meeting the plant's needs, and also supporting Anshan Iron and Steel. Since the beginning of this year, the plant has overfulfilled the fertilizer production plan every month, and the production of ammonium sulfate in the second quarter increased by more than 14,000 tons compared with the first quarter.

    Nanjing Chemical Industry Company, which accounts for more than one-third of the country's fertilizer production, has seen an increase of 36% in the production of ammonium sulfate and superphosphate in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year, thanks to the large number of rationalization proposals put forward by the workers to promote production. At present, the company is experimenting with the production of potassium fertilizer. Potassium fertilizer has a very high fertilizer efficiency, and China has not produced it in large quantities in the past.

    In order to promote the continued increase in fertilizer production, the Ministry of Chemical Industry recently held a meeting of key chemical plants to re-examine and determine the technical measures for increasing chemical fertilizer production in the second half of the year. In view of the fact that increasing sulfuric acid production is the key to increasing fertilizer production at present, the Ministry of Chemical Industry is taking various measures to help factories increase sulfuric acid production, while trying to accelerate the construction and expansion projects of large-scale synthetic ammonia plants in Sichuan, Taiyuan, Jilin, and other places, and helping various regions establish a batch of calcium-magnesium phosphate fertilizer plants with simple equipment and no need for sulfuric acid as raw material, so as to rapidly improve fertilizer production capacity.

### 增产化肥支援农业  上半年氮、磷、钾肥比去年同期增长百分之二十

    增产化肥支援农业
    上半年氮、磷、钾肥比去年同期增长百分之二十
    新华社24日讯　各地化学工业部门正在采取措施增产化肥支援农业生产。据化学工业部统计，今年上半年各地的氮、磷、钾三类化学肥料，比去年同期增长了20％左右，许多化工厂职工鼓足干劲，克服困难，保证了化肥增产。
    大连化工厂是全国化工厂中增产化肥成绩最好的一个单位。这个厂今年一开始，就遇到了电力不足的问题；但是由于加强了调度工作，全厂职工认真执行节约用电的措施，第一季度节约电四百三十五万度，保证完成了硫铵的生产计划。第二季度供电情况有了好转，职工们在深入开展优质高产社会主义劳动竞赛中，又克服了不少薄弱环节，为增产创造了条件。例如当时由于硫酸供应不足，严重地影响了氮肥生产，职工们便采取改进矿石配料的比例等办法，每天增产稀硫酸七十多吨，满足了本厂的需要，还支援了鞍钢。今年以来，这个厂月月超额完成了化肥生产计划，第二季度生产的硫铵比第一季度又增产了一万四千多吨。
    化肥产量占全国三分之一以上的南京化学工业公司，由于职工们提出了大批促进生产的合理化建议，上半年全公司生产的硫铵、过磷酸钙，比去年同期增长了36％。目前，这个公司正在试验生产钾肥。钾肥的肥效很高，我国过去还没有大量生产过。
    为促进化肥继续增产，化工部在最近召开了重点化工厂的会议，重新审查和确定了下半年各厂增产化学肥料的技术措施。鉴于增产硫酸是当前增产化肥的关键，化工部正在采取各种措施，帮助各厂增加硫酸产量，同时设法加快四川、太原、吉林等地大型合成氨厂的新建和扩建工程，帮助各地建立一批设备简单而又不需要硫酸做原料的钙镁磷肥厂，以迅速提高化肥的生产能力。（附图片）
