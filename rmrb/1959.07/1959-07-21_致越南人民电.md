To the Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee and to all the Vietnamese people:

The people of all circles in the capital of the People's Republic of China solemnly held a meeting on July 20, 1959, and unanimously and resolutely supported the just struggle of the Vietnamese people against the United States' collusion with the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to undermine the Geneva Accords and to strive for the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, and paid the most sublime fraternal respect to the heroic Vietnamese people.

The meeting unanimously pointed out that for several years, the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have consistently made unremitting efforts to strictly implement the Geneva Accords and to realize the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, thereby making a significant contribution to the cause of maintaining peace, and have been warmly praised and widely supported by peace-loving countries and people all over the world. However, due to the continuous obstruction of US imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, the peaceful reunification of northern and southern Vietnam has not yet been realized.

The meeting strongly condemned the collusion between US imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, which has consistently and seriously violated and undermined the various provisions and basic principles of the Geneva Accords, and has rejected the various proposals put forward by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. The United States has also continuously and illegally shipped large quantities of arms and a large number of military personnel into South Vietnam, stepped up the expansion of military bases in South Vietnam, and brutally suppressed the patriotic and progressive forces in South Vietnam, attempting to permanently divide Vietnam and turn South Vietnam into a base for the United States to launch wars of aggression in Indochina and Southeast Asia. Recently, the United States has more blatantly interfered in the internal affairs of Laos, constantly plotting subversive conspiracies against the Kingdom of Cambodia, and creating tension in various parts of Asia. These aggressive acts by the United States seriously threaten the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the peace of Indochina, Asia, and the world.

The Vietnamese people's struggle against the United States' collusion with the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to undermine the Geneva Accords and to strive for the peaceful reunification of Vietnam is completely just and reasonable. The people of Asian and African countries and peace-loving countries and people all over the world stand by the Vietnamese people and warmly support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people. In order to realize the peaceful reunification of Vietnam and to ensure the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords, the meeting in the Chinese capital to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Geneva Accords and support the peaceful reunification of Vietnam resolutely demands that the United States must withdraw all military personnel from South Vietnam and abolish all military bases; the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique must immediately stop undermining the Geneva Accords; the United States must immediately stop all aggressive activities in Indochina and other parts of Asia!

The Chinese people reiterate: We resolutely support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people for the peaceful reunification of their motherland, and resolutely continue to work for the thorough implementation of

    致越南人民电越南亚非人民团结委员会并转全体越南人民：
    中华人民共和国首都各界人民，于1959年7月20日隆重举行大会，一致坚决支持越南人民反对美国勾结吴庭艳集团破坏日内瓦协议和争取越南和平统一的正义斗争，并且向英勇的越南人民致以最崇高的兄弟般的敬意。
    大会一致指出：几年来，越南人民和越南民主共和国政府一贯为严格履行日内瓦协议和为实现越南的和平统一而进行着不懈的努力，从而对维护和平的事业作出了重大贡献，受到了全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的热烈赞扬和普遍支持。但是，由于美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团的不断阻挠，越南北部和南部迄今仍未实现和平统一。
    大会严厉谴责美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团相勾结，一贯严重地违反和破坏日内瓦协议的各项条款和基本原则，并且拒绝越南民主共和国就越南和平统一所提出的各项建议。美国还不断向南越非法运入大量军火和大批军事人员，加紧在南越扩建军事基地，残酷地镇压南越的爱国进步力量，企图永远分裂越南，把南越变成美国在印度支那和东南亚地区发动侵略战争的基地。最近，美国更露骨地干涉老挝内政，不断策划对柬埔寨王国的颠覆阴谋，并且在亚洲各地制造紧张局势。美国的这些侵略行为，严重地威胁着越南民主共和国的安全和印度支那、亚洲及世界的和平。
    越南人民反对美国勾结吴庭艳集团破坏日内瓦协议和争取越南和平统一的斗争，是完全正义和合理的。亚非各国人民和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民都站在越南人民一边，热烈支持越南人民的正义斗争。为了越南和平统一的实现，为了保证日内瓦协议的贯彻执行，中国首都各界人民纪念日内瓦协议五周年、支持越南和平统一大会坚决要求：美国必须从南越撤走一切军事人员，撤消一切军事基地；美国和吴庭艳集团必须立即停止对日内瓦协议的破坏；美国必须立即停止在印度支那和亚洲其它地区的一切侵略活动！
    中国人民重申：坚决支持越南人民为争取祖国和平统一的正义斗争，坚决为维护日内瓦协议在印度支那的彻底实施而继续努力。在建设社会主义的事业和反对侵略、保卫和平的共同斗争中，中国人民永远和兄弟的越南人民站在一起。我们深信，在以胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府的领导下，在以苏联为首的强大社会主义阵营和一切爱好和平的国家和人民的支持下，日内瓦协议是一定要彻底实施的，越南人民争取和平统一的正义斗争是一定能取得最后的、完全的胜利。
  中华人民共和国首都各界人

    支持越南和平统一大会
