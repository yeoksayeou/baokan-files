    U.S. Naval Base in Cuba
    Question: News reports that the United States is using its naval base in Cuba as a haven for sheltering Batista war criminals. How did the United States come to have a naval base in Cuba?
    Answer: The U.S. naval bases in Guantanamo and Caimanera, Cuba, were seized by the United States during its invasion of Cuba. The United States occupied Cuba militarily from 1898 to 1902. When forced to withdraw from Cuba, the United States installed a puppet regime and forced the Cuban Constitutional Convention to include the "Platt Amendment" as part of the Cuban Constitution. Article Three of this amendment stipulated that the United States had the right to send troops into Cuba and obtain the rights to naval bases in Guantanamo and Caimanera. In 1903, the United States further forced the Cuban government to lease these two naval bases to the United States.
    The two U.S.-occupied naval bases are located in eastern Cuba, in the southeast of Oriente Province. The United States often stations 5,000 troops in Caimanera and significantly reinforces them when planning armed intervention. Recently, there have been reports that the U.S. garrison in Guantanamo has been increased by 30,000 troops.
    For half a century, the United States has used these two bases to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs. From 1906 to 1922, the United States intervened militarily three times. Since the Cuban revolution began on July 26, 1953, the U.S. garrison has fully supported the Batista dictatorship in its bloody suppression of the rebel army.
    The United States has continuously supplied Batista with weapons such as rockets, tanks, and carbines through these two bases, and when Batista's air force bombed areas controlled by the rebel army, they refueled directly at the aforementioned bases.
    Last July, when the Batista regime was on the verge of collapse, the United States, under the pretext of protecting its pumping stations and water pipes at the Guantanamo naval base in Cuba, sent Marines to occupy Cuban territory near the base. Due to criticism from Cuba and world public opinion, the United States had to withdraw its troops. After the fall of the Batista regime, in order to step up interference in the Cuban revolution, the United States is using the base as a springboard for armed intervention, increasing the number of troops and sheltering Cuban war criminals within the base. U.S. planes and warships also frequently patrol the waters near Cuba. On June 25, the commander of the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo led a fleet to the Dominican Republic for a "visit," and the Dominican Republic is acting as a tool for U.S. armed intervention in Cuba.

### 美国在古巴的海军基地

    美国在古巴的海军基地
    问：报载美国把它在古巴的海军基地作为窝藏巴蒂斯塔战犯的庇护所。美国怎样会在古巴有海军基地？
    答：美国在古巴关塔那摩和卡伊马内拉的海军基地，是美国侵略古巴时强占的。美国自1898年到1902年曾武装占领过古巴。在被迫撤离古巴时，美国扶植了一个傀儡上台，并强令古巴制宪会议将“普拉特修正案”作为古巴宪法的一部分，这个修正案第三条规定美国有权把军队开入古巴，并取得关塔那摩和卡伊马内拉海军基地的权利。1903年，美国又迫使古巴政府把这两个海军基地租给美国。
    美国强占的这两个海军基地，位于古巴东部、奥连特省的东南部。美国在卡伊马内拉经常驻有五千军队，在策划武装干涉时则大量增援。最近有消息说，美国在关塔那摩的驻军就增加了三万人。
    半世纪以来，美国一直利用这两个基地，干涉古巴内政。从1906年到1922年美国就曾三次出兵干涉。自1953年7月26日古巴发动革命以后，美国驻军全力支持巴蒂斯塔独裁政权对起义军进行的血腥镇压。
    美国通过这两个基地源源不断地把火箭、坦克、卡宾枪等武器供给巴蒂斯塔，当巴蒂斯塔空军轰炸起义军控制地区时，都直接在上述基地加油。
    去年7月，巴蒂斯塔政权朝不保夕的时候，美国曾借口保护它在古巴海军基地关塔那摩的抽水站和输水管，派遣海军陆战队占领这个基地附近的古巴领土。由于遭到古巴和世界舆论的指责，美国才不得不撤回它的军队。巴蒂斯塔政权倒台后，美国为了加紧干涉古巴革命，正在利用基地作为武装干涉的一个跳板，一面增加大量驻军，一面在基地内窝藏古巴战犯。美国飞机和军舰还经常在古巴附近海面巡逻，6月25日美国驻关塔那摩海军基地总司令曾率领过一支舰队到多米尼加进行“访问”，而多米尼加正在充当美国武装干涉古巴的工具。
