    Write Good Captions for Production Stills
    Qi Dongye
    Once production stills are displayed in a window, their function as internal reference material for art groups should disappear, and they should become important promotional items. However, the comrades who seem to be writing captions for production stills (including selecting the stills) may not have understood this point, and as a result, the captions for production stills have appeared in the following situations: ? Simply writing nothing at all; ? A little better than the first type, writing a line of dialogue, some with the character's name in front of the line, some simplified; ? Generally explaining the content of each photo individually, but acting independently and disconnectedly. Of course, there are good ones (although indeed not many), but the aforementioned three categories leave people standing in front of the window for a long time, knowing little more than that this is a Chinese play or a foreign play, a modern play or an ancient play, and otherwise clueless, as if it were a charade – want to know the details, please come to see the play?!
    No, we need to put some effort into this. Here are two suggestions: in terms of material selection, in addition to the quality of the photography, pay attention to the continuity of the images; for captions, it's best not to copy lines from the play, since it's a "description," it should really "explain clearly," so that people can get a general impression of the play from the caption alone, without having to rely on the "synopsis" next to it (which is not always available). With these two points, I think we should treat this work as an artistic creation.
    In addition, this suggestion also applies to small movie posters, because sometimes the symptoms are the same.

    写好剧照说明
    齐东野
    剧照，只要一公布在橱窗之中，它的做为艺术团体内部的资料作用，就应该消失，而成为一个重要的宣传品了。但是，看来为剧照写说明（也包括选剧照）的同志，却似乎未必弄清楚了这个问题，因而剧照的说明就出现了下列几种情况：?干脆什么都不写；?比头一种好些，写上一句台词，有的在这句话前加上一个剧中人名，有的则从简；?大体上逐张地解释了一下内容，但是各自为政，互不连属。好的自然还有（虽然确实不多），但前述三派，却是让人在橱窗前边伫立了半晌，除了大体上知道这是个中国戏外国戏，现代戏古代戏而外，其余茫无所知，仿佛这是个哑谜——若知其详，请来看戏？！
    不行，得在这上边花点功夫，有两个建议：选材上除却拍的好坏之外，要注意到画面的连续性；说明词，最好别抄台词，既是“说明”，就要真的“说明白了”，让人不要借助于旁边的“故事梗概”（这个更不是都有的），单从剧照说明词中就能得出对这出戏的大体印象。有此二端，我看得把这工作当做一项艺术创造工作来对待。
    另外，这建议也适用于电影小海报，因为有时症候相同。
