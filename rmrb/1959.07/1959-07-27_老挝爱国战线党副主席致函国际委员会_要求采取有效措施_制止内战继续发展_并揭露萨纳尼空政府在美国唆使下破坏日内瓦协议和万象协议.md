Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 25th: A letter written on July 18 by Phoumi Vongvichit, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front Party, to the International Commission in Laos was released here today. This letter comprehensively narrates the implementation of the Geneva Agreements in Laos over the past five years, exposes the six reactionary policies of the Phoui Sananikone government in sabotaging the Geneva and Vientiane Agreements under the instigation of US imperialism, and simultaneously presents six demands to the Sananikone government. Phoumi Vongvichit's letter also hopes that the International Commission in Laos will "take effective measures as early as possible to ensure that the Geneva Agreements on Laos are respected and strictly implemented, and to halt the continued development of the civil war in Laos."

Phoumi Vongvichit's letter was entrusted to the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for forwarding to the International Commission in Laos and its Chairman, General Bal. He also sent a copy of the letter to the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, as one of the signatories of the Geneva Agreements on Laos and responsible for the implementation of the agreement.

The letter, in reviewing the evolution of the situation in Laos, states that since the signing of the Geneva Agreements, the Lao Fighting Units have consistently strictly and thoroughly implemented all provisions of the agreement. At the same time, they proactively suggested holding consultative meetings with the Royal Government to resolve outstanding political issues. However, shortly after the signing of the Geneva Agreements, the Katay Don Sasorith government, acting on the orders of US imperialism, launched a large-scale offensive against the two provinces where the Lao Fighting Units were concentrated, undermining the agreements signed by both sides in many respects.

The letter says that only after Prince Souvanna Phouma became Prime Minister, due to the proactive suggestions of the Lao Fighting Units, did the two sides sign a series of agreements in Vientiane, and subsequently formed a coalition government with representatives from the former Lao Fighting Units participating. However, US imperialism forced the Phouma government to resign, overthrew the coalition government, and supported Phoui Sananikone to take power. Since then, the situation in Laos has deteriorated day by day.

The letter then lists the six reactionary policies implemented by the Sananikone government since coming to power, which violate the Geneva Agreements:

	One, the Sananikone government constantly violates the Geneva Agreements, completely abandons the policy of peace and neutrality, and allows the United States to turn Laos into a military base for launching war.

	US imperialism not only controls the Lao army but also manipulates all the internal, external, economic, and financial policies of the Lao Royal Government.

	“The Sananikone government, following US orders, colludes with the South Vietnamese authorities, conspiring to establish a military alliance with South Vietnam and Thailand.” The Lao authorities also allow Chiang Kai-shek's remnant bandits and Ngo Dinh Diem's lackeys to harass the Lao-China and Lao-Vietnam borders. They have also sent many henchmen to participate in the meetings and military exercises convened by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. “This military aggression group has actually expanded its scope of activities to the territory of Laos.”

	Two, the Sananikone government violated the agreement on the establishment of a coalition government, excluded representatives of the Lao Patriotic Front Party, and shamelessly sold Laos to the United States.

	Three, the Sananikone government cancelled the minimum democratic freedoms, established a dictatorial system, and undermined the current constitution and the independent operational power of the National Assembly.

	The Sananikone-Katay group recently established two special agent organizations, the so-called "Civil Service Department" and the "Committee for Defending National Interests," to further persecute patriotic people.

	The Lao authorities are also attempting to revise the current constitution and electoral law in order to establish a National Assembly that completely serves the aggressive interests of US imperialism.

	Four, the Sananikone government has implemented policies of persecution and discrimination against the Lao Patriotic Front Party and other progressive political groups.

	Since Sananikone came to power, thousands of former Lao Fighting Units personnel and resistance personnel have been shot and innocently imprisoned in jails across the country. They barbarically persecute the families of former Lao Fighting Units personnel.

	The Sananikone government has recently attempted to abolish the legal operational rights of the Lao Patriotic Front Party. Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the former Lao Fighting Units, as well as leaders of the Peace and Neutrality Committee, are still under secret surveillance by disguised spies and police.

	Five, the Sananikone government violated the agreements reached by both sides regarding the system of administrative organizations in Sam Neua and Phongsaly provinces, and violated the regulations regarding incorporating former Lao Fighting Units civil servants into the administrative organizations and technical departments of the Royal Government.

	The Sananikone government transferred cadres of the Lao Fighting Units away from these two provinces, and suppressed and persecuted the people of these two provinces. They also dismissed cadres of the former Lao Fighting Units who had been appointed to positions in various departments, and sent them to the Ministry of Interior for house arrest, depriving them of work and living conditions.

	Six, the Sananikone government violated the military agreements signed by both Lao sides, undermined national harmony, and provoked civil war.

The letter points out that, in view of the above facts, "US imperialism is the chief culprit in creating the turbulent situation in Laos." And "the Sananikone-Katay group and the heads of the Committee for Defending National Interests have sold the interests of the nation cheaply to US imperialism, abandoned the path of peace and neutrality, undermined national harmony and national unity, and launched a civil war." US imperialism and the Sananikone government must be responsible for all the consequences caused by their crimes.

The letter points out: "The situation in Laos is developing in an increasingly serious direction. The recent statements by Sisouk na Champassak, Deputy Minister of Propaganda of the Lao Royal Government, and Foreign Minister Khamphan Panya, saying that "the situation in Laos is stable," cannot deceive anyone. The British government's view of the situation in Laos is completely inconsistent with the actual situation in Laos."

The letter reiterates the position of the Lao Patriotic Front Party is: "Willing to unite with people of all nationalities and all strata, and to cooperate with all Lao patriots and those who support peace, to jointly wage a resolute struggle against reactionary US imperialism, and to build a peaceful and neutral, independent and democratic, united and prosperous Laos."

The letter then presents six demands to the Royal Government:

	(1) Thoroughly and strictly implement the Geneva and Vientiane Agreements, and immediately stop all actions that expand the civil war.

	(2) Earnestly implement a policy of peace and neutrality, safeguard national sovereignty and independence, establish diplomatic relations with all countries, especially neighboring countries, on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and abandon the path of acting as a pawn of US imperialism.

	(3) Establish a coalition government with representatives from the Lao Patriotic Front Party, various progressive parties, and representatives of all nationalities.

	(4) Guarantee the people's various democratic freedoms, respect the power of the National Assembly, and respect the current constitution.

	(5) Immediately abandon the policy of persecuting and suppressing the Lao Patriotic Front Party, the Peace and Neutrality Committee, and other progressive political organizations, release all cadres of the Lao Patriotic Front Party and former resistance personnel who have been illegally imprisoned in various places, restore the freedom of Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front Party, and allow the "Lao Patriotic News" to continue publication.

	(6) Respect the administrative organizational system of Sam Neua and Phongsaly provinces, return the former Lao Fighting Units civil servants who were employed in the two provinces according to the agreements signed by both sides to the people of the two provinces, and abolish all discriminatory policies against the former Lao Fighting Units civil servants who have been incorporated into the Royal Government's administrative structure.

The letter says: "The Lao people highly appreciate the contributions made by the International Commission in Laos in the past to consolidating peace in Laos and supervising and monitoring the implementation of the Geneva Agreements in Laos." The letter hopes that General Bal will take active measures so that the International Commission in Laos can resume its activities in the near future.

    老挝爱国战线党副主席致函国际委员会
    要求采取有效措施　制止内战继续发展
    并揭露萨纳尼空政府在美国唆使下破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议
    新华社河内25日电　这里今天公布了老挝爱国战线党中央委员会副主席费当7月18日写给老挝国际委员会的信。这封信全面地叙述了日内瓦协议签订五年来在老挝履行的情况，揭露了培·萨纳尼空政府在美帝国主义唆使下破坏日内瓦协议和万象协议的六项反动政策，同时向萨纳尼空政府提出了六项要求。费当的信还希望老挝国际委员会“尽早采取有效措施，使关于老挝的日内瓦协议得到尊重和严格履行，制止老挝内战的继续发展”。
    费当的信是托越南民主共和国政府转寄给老挝国际委员会以及委员会主席巴尔中将的。他同时还把这封信的副本寄给作为关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议签字国之一、同时对这项协议的履行负有责任的越南民主共和国政府。
    信里回顾老挝局势演变情况说，日内瓦协议签订以来，寮国战斗部队一贯严格和彻底执行协议的一切条款。同时主动建议和王国政府举行协商会议来解决还存在的政治问题。但是，日内瓦协议签订后不久，卡代政府执行美帝国主义的命令，向寮国战斗部队集结的两省大举进攻，在许多方面破坏了双方签订的协议。
    信里说，直到梭发那·富马亲王担任首相之后，由于寮国战斗部队的主动建议，双方在万象签订了一系列的协议，随后组成了有前寮国战斗部队的代表参加的联合政府。但是美帝国主义迫使富马政府辞职，推翻了联合政府，扶植培·萨纳尼空上台。从此，老挝局势日益恶化。
    信里接着列举了萨纳尼空政府执政以来所施行的破坏日内瓦协议的六项反动政策：
    一、萨纳尼空政府不断破坏日内瓦协议，完全背弃和平中立政策，让美国把老挝变成发动战争的军事基地。
    美帝国主义不仅控制了老挝的军队而且操纵了老挝王国政府的一切对内、对外政策和经济、财政大权。
      “萨纳尼空政府遵从美国的命令，同南越当局勾结，阴谋同南越和泰国成立军事联盟。”老挝当局还让蒋介石残匪和吴庭艳的走狗在老挝—中国和老挝—越南边境骚扰。他们还派遣了许多爪牙参加了东南亚集团历次召开的会议和军事演习。“这个军事侵略集团实际上已经把它们的活动范围扩大到老挝的国土上。”
    二、萨纳尼空政府破坏了关于成立联合政府的协议，排斥老挝爱国战线党的代表，无耻地把老挝出卖给美国。
    三、萨纳尼空政府取消了起码的民主自由权，建立了独裁制度，破坏了现行宪法和国会的独立活动权力。
    萨纳尼空—卡代集团最近还成立了所谓“民事服务处”和“保卫国家利益委员会”两个特务组织，进一步迫害爱国人民。
    老挝当局并且企图修改现行宪法和选举法，以便成立完全为美帝国主义的侵略利益服务的国会。
    四、萨纳尼空政府对老挝爱国战线党和其他进步的政治团体实行迫害和歧视政策。
    萨纳尼空执政以来，有数以千计的前寮国战斗部队人员和抗战人员被枪杀和被无辜地监禁在遍及全国的牢狱里。他们野蛮迫害前寮国战斗部队人员的家属。
    萨纳尼空政府最近又企图取消老挝爱国战线党的合法活动权利。苏发努冯亲王和前寮国战斗部队的其他领导人以及和平中立委员会的领导人仍然受到伪装起来的密探和警察秘密监视。
    五、萨纳尼空政府破坏了双方就关于桑怒和丰沙里两省的行政机构的体制问题所作的规定，破坏了关于把前寮国战斗部队公务人员编入王国政府行政机构和技术部门的规定。
    萨纳尼空政府把寮国战斗部队的干部调离这两个省，对这两个省的人民进行镇压和迫害。他们还把被委任在各个部门任职的前寮国战斗部队的干部撤职，并送到内务部软禁，使他们失去工作和生活条件。
    六、萨纳尼空政府破坏老挝双方签订的军事协议，破坏民族的和睦、挑起内战。
    信里指出，从上述事实看来，
  “美帝国主义就是制造老挝动乱局势的首犯”。而“萨纳尼空—卡代集团和保卫国家利益委员会的头目们把民族的利益廉价出卖给美帝国主义，背弃了和平中立路线，破坏民族和睦和国家统一，发动了内战。”美帝国主义和萨纳尼空政府必须对它们的罪行所引起的一切后果负责。
    信里指出：“老挝局势正在日益严重地发展着。老挝王国政府宣传部副大臣西苏·纳占巴萨和外交大臣坎番·班雅最近发表的说“老挝局势稳定”之类的声明是骗不了人的。英国政府对老挝局势的看法是完全不符合目前老挝的实际情况的。
    信里重申了老挝爱国战线党的立场是：“愿同各民族和各阶层人民团结，同一切老挝爱国者和赞成和平的人合作，共同向反动的美帝国主义进行坚决的斗争，建设一个和平中立、独立民主、统一和繁荣的老挝。”
    信里接着向王国政府提出了六项要求：
      （一）彻底和严格履行日内瓦协议和万象协议，立即停止一切扩大内战的行动。
      （二）严正实行和平中立政策，维护国家主权和独立，同所有各国、特别是各邻国，在和平共处五项原则的基础上建立外交关系，放弃充当美帝国主义的走狗的路线。
      （三）成立有老挝爱国战线党、各进步党派代表和各族人民代表参加的联合政府。
      （四）保障人民的各项民主自由权，尊重国会的权力，尊重现行宪法。
      （五）立即放弃迫害和镇压老挝爱国战线党、和平中立委员会和其他进步政治组织的政策，释放所有被非法监禁在各地的老挝爱国战线党干部和前抗战人员，恢复苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党其他领袖的自由，让“老挝爱国报”继续出版。
      （六）尊重桑怒和丰沙里两省的行政组织体制，把根据双方签订的协议而在两省任职的前寮国战斗部队的公务人员交还给两省人民，取消对编入王国政权编制中的前寮国战斗部队公务人员的一切歧视政策。
    信里说：“老挝人民对老挝国际委员会过去对巩固老挝和平、监督和监察在老挝履行日内瓦协议方面所作出的贡献，给予很高的评价。”这封信希望巴尔中将采取积极措施，使老挝国际委员会能够在最近期间恢复活动。
