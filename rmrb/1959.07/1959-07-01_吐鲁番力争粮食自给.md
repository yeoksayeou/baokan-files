　　Urumqi, July 30th (reported by this newspaper) – The Turpan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has corrected its past neglect of grain production this year. While developing economic crops, it is vigorously expanding the acreage of grain crops and increasing yield per unit area. This year, the county's grain crop area can be increased from 150,000 mu last year to 200,000 mu, and the total output is expected to increase by 60% compared with last year, enabling the county to achieve grain self-sufficiency.
　　Turpan County is an economic crop area known for grapes, melons, and cotton. In the past, the acreage of economic crops accounted for about half of the county's total area. Farmers believed that the value of each mu of economic crops was more than three times that of grain crops and were unwilling to grow more grain. As a result, the county relied on the state to allocate grain from other places for about half of the year. Because there were few grain crops, livestock feed and fodder were also insufficient every year.
　　This year, the county's wheat area has been expanded by 30,000 mu, and 43,000 mu of autumn crops have already been sown. Recently, various communes have revised their plans, and the county's grain crop area can be expanded from 150,000 mu last year to 200,000 mu this year. The field management of grain crops has also been carried out more carefully this year. (Han Wenhui)

    吐鲁番力争粮食自给
    本报乌鲁木齐30日电　中共新疆吐鲁番县委会今年纠正了忽视粮食生产的思想，在发展经济作物的同时，大力扩大粮食作物面积和提高单位面积产量。今年全县粮食作物面积可从去年的十五万亩增加到二十万亩，预计总产量将比去年增加60％，全县粮食可达到自给。
      吐鲁番县是以葡萄、甜瓜和棉花著称的经济作物区。历年来经济作物播种面积约占全县总面积的半数，农民认为每亩经济作物价值高于粮食作物三倍以上，不愿多种粮食。因此全县每年约有半年粮食依靠国家从外地调拨。因为粮食作物少，牲畜饲料饲草每年也都不够用。
    今年全县小麦面积已经扩大了三万亩，秋田作物目前已播种了四万三千多亩，最近各公社又修订了计划，今年全县粮食作物可从去年的十五万亩扩大到二十万亩，粮食作物的田间管理工作，今年作得也比较细致。　（韩文慧）
