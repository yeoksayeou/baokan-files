Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 23rd: The flood peak exceeding 10,000 cubic meters per second that appeared in the middle reaches of the Yellow River has now passed through Sanmenxia. After the flood peak flow was blocked by the cofferdam protecting the dam construction and the dam under construction, it was reduced to 6,200 cubic meters per second when it was discharged downstream of Sanmenxia.

Around the 20th, multiple places in the Yellow River's middle reaches, from the Tuoketuo River down to its tributaries, experienced rainfall. The rainfall in the adjacent areas of Shanxi and Shaanxi was generally over 30 millimeters. The center of the heavy rain was in northeastern Shaanxi Province, where the rainfall in many places reached over 120 millimeters, causing a sharp rise in the water level of the Yellow River tributaries downstream of Tuoketuo. After the tributary floods converged, the flow at the Wubu station (within Shaanxi Province) on the main stream of the Yellow River above Sanmenxia reached a peak of 13,800 cubic meters per second at 12:00 noon on the 21st. When this flood peak entered the Sanmenxia reservoir area from Tongguan, the flow was 12,800 cubic meters per second. Sanmenxia began to rise at 14:00 on the 22nd, and the water level rose by more than three meters in the first two hours. At 5:00 a.m. today, when the peak arrived, the highest water level in front of the cofferdam reached 300.35 meters, but the cofferdam was still more than eight meters higher than the flood peak water level. After 5:00 a.m., the water level in front of the dam began to drop.

The Sanmenxia cofferdam and dam played a partial flood control role in withstanding this flood peak. During this flood peak of over 10,000 cubic meters per second, the reservoir area blocked and stored up to 200 million cubic meters of floodwater at most, accounting for almost half of the total flood peak volume, thus reducing the flood peak. It is estimated that when the flood peak reaches the Huayuankou station in Henan Province on the morning of the 24th, the flow may remain at around 5,500 cubic meters per second.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, July 23rd: The Jining-Erlian Railway, which was damaged in eight places by mountain floods at 16:00 on the 19th, was reopened to traffic at 17:40 today after four days and nights of emergency repairs. The production and lives of the disaster-stricken farmers along the railway line have also been properly arranged.

From 15:00 to 17:20 on the 19th, a sudden torrential rain fell in Tumuerdai area of Chahar Right Wing Rear Banner in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, with rainfall reaching 90 millimeters, causing mountain floods. Eight sections of the Jining-Erlian Railway between Tumuerdai and Wulanhua stations were washed away. At the same time, Huangjiacun, Xinjingzi, Huangyangcheng and other villages in Chahar Right Wing Rear Banner, as well as Lijiacun, Kangjiapuzi, and Baishajing, three villages in Zhangbei County, Hebei Province, which are adjacent to Chahar Right Wing Rear Banner, were also hit by floods.

After the disaster occurred, the Ministry of Railways and relevant departments of the Autonomous Region immediately transported a large number of grass bags, steel rails, and other materials to support the emergency repairs. Local railway bureau and party committee leaders led 7,000 railway employees, enterprise workers, farmers, and People's Liberation Army officers and soldiers, who, after four days and nights of emergency repairs, restored all the damaged railways, bridges, culverts, and other facilities. At the same time, the People's Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the Ulanqab League Commissioner's Office immediately sent cadres to rescue the people trapped by the floods in several villages, properly resettle them, and organize the masses to engage in production for self-relief.

    昔日“中流砥柱”怎比得今天黄河工程
    三门峡砍掉洪峰一半
    集二线被山洪冲坏的路基桥梁全部修复
    新华社郑州23日电　黄河中游出现的一万秒立方米以上的洪峰，今天已经通过三门峡下泄。洪峰流量经过保护大坝施工的围堰和正在施工中的大坝的拦蓄，在三门峡下泄时，已经减少为六千二百秒立方米。
    20日前后，黄河中游托克托以下干支流流域多处下雨，山西和陕西的毗邻地区雨量一般在三十毫米以上，暴雨中心在陕西省东北部，好多地方的降雨量达一百二十毫米以上，因而黄河托克托以下干支流水位猛涨。干支流洪水汇合以后，黄河干流三门峡以上的吴堡站（在陕西境内）在21日中午十二时出现了一万三千八百秒立方米的洪峰。这个洪峰从潼关进入三门峡库区时流量为一万二千八百秒立方米。三门峡从22日十四时开始涨水，水位在最初的两小时内上涨了三米多。今天上午五时，洪峰峰顶到达时，围堰前最高水位达到三百点三五米，但围堰仍比洪峰水位高八米多。五时以后坝前水位开始下降。
    三门峡的围堰和大坝在经受这次洪峰考验时，发挥了部分拦洪的作用。这次上万秒立方米的洪峰，通过三门峡时，库区拦蓄的洪水量最多时达两亿立方米以上，几乎占洪峰总水量的一半，因此削减了洪峰。预计，洪峰24日晨到达河南花园口站时，流量可能剩五千五百秒立方米左右。
    据新华社呼和浩特23日电　19日十六时被山洪冲坏八处的集（宁）二（连）铁路，经过四昼夜抢修，已在今天十七时四十分恢复通车。铁路沿线受灾农民的生产和生活也得到了妥善安置。
    19日十五时到十七时二十分，内蒙古自治区察哈尔右翼后旗土木尔台一带突降暴雨，雨量达九十毫米，以致山洪暴发。集二铁路土木尔台到乌兰花站之间，有八处被冲毁。与此同时，察哈尔右翼后旗的黄家村、新井子、黄羊城等村以及同察哈尔右翼后旗毗连的河北省张北县李家村、康家铺子、白沙井三个村，也遭到洪水袭击。
    灾情发生后，铁道部和自治区有关部门，立即运来大批草袋和钢轨等物资支援抢修。当地铁路局和党委负责人带领铁路员工、机关企业职工、农民和解放军官兵等七千人，经过四昼夜的抢修，把被冲毁的铁路、桥梁、涵洞等全部修复。同时，内蒙古自治区人民委员会和乌兰察布盟公署都立即派出干部，把几个村庄被洪水围困的群众解救出来，妥善安置，并且组织群众进行生产自救。（附图片）
