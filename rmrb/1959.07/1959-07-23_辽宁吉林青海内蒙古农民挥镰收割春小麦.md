Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 22nd: In Liaoning Province, wheat crops, mainly spring wheat, have been more than half harvested. Currently, farmers in wheat-producing areas are continuing the harvest under the slogan "Intensify the rush harvest, don't lose a grain," and it is expected that all harvesting will be completed in about ten more days.

This year, Liaoning Province planted 1.06 million mu of wheat crops (of which 760,000 mu are spring wheat, and the rest are winter wheat and barley), an increase of 76.6% compared to last year. Most wheat fields were deeply ploughed and reasonably densely planted, and the amount of fertilizer applied to wheat fields also increased compared to last year. During the winter wheat filling stage and the spring wheat jointing and heading stages, many areas did not receive rain for thirty to forty days. In order to achieve a good wheat harvest, people's communes in various regions persevered in the struggle to resist drought and protect seedlings. All areas with water sources irrigated the wheat fields two or three times, while also paying attention to the prevention and control of pests and diseases. Therefore, wheat in various places has grown with large ears and full grains, presenting a scene of a bumper harvest.

People's communes in various wheat-producing areas, based on the characteristics of this year's high wheat yield, labor-intensive harvesting, and the rainy season, generally adjusted labor organization before the harvest, established responsibility systems, and prepared sufficient tools. After the harvest began, they concentrated manpower to rush harvest and collect, carefully cutting and collecting, and the quality of the wheat harvest has improved significantly, with losses and waste greatly reduced compared to previous years.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 22nd: More than 2.7 million mu of spring wheat in Jilin Province are gradually ripening. Fuyu, Tongyu, and other counties where the wheat ripened earlier have already begun harvesting.

This year, the spring wheat planting area in Jilin Province increased 1.6 times compared to last year, the most wheat ever planted in history. Before sowing, more than 90% of the wheat fields were deep-ploughed to a depth of seven inches or more, and all wheat fields were reasonably densely planted; the amount of fertilizer applied also increased by one to two times compared to previous years. Although the province experienced prolonged drought and little rain this spring, which was unfavorable for wheat growth, people's communes did everything possible to tap water sources and irrigate in a timely manner, finally overcoming the drought, and the wheat growth situation was better than in previous years.

In order to ensure a bumper harvest of spring wheat this year, the wheat-producing areas, according to the instructions of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee, had already made preparations for the wheat harvest. The people's communes in the Baicheng area, which planted the most wheat, have prepared 400,000 sickles, 50,000 scythes, and rapid harvesting machines, animal-drawn harvesters, carts, and other equipment to be put into rush harvesting at the appropriate time. The communes in Da'an County learned from the past lessons that the wheat fields were not leveled in time, and the wheat could not be transported back in time after harvesting. This year, they have completely leveled the large and small threshing grounds in advance to ensure clean cutting, clean pulling, clean picking, and clean threshing, and that every grain returns home.

Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 22nd: Spring wheat and highland barley in the irrigated lands of Xunhua, Hualong, Minhe, Ledu, and other agricultural areas of Qinghai Province have begun to ripen, and farmers of all ethnic groups, filled with the joy of a bumper harvest, have begun harvesting.

This year's crops are indeed growing well, and encouraging news of bumper harvests has been spreading since the harvest just began. The Yashiga Production Team of the Duoba Commune in Hualong Hui Autonomous County, on the banks of the Yellow River, saw an average yield of spring barley of eighteen mu more than double compared to last year. This wheat field was deep-ploughed, with increased basal fertilizer applied, topdressing three times, watering five times, and weeding three times, resulting in high yields. The members said that this is the blossoming of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

Qinghai Province planted more than 4 million mu of spring wheat and highland barley this year. Due to different terrains and climates, the harvest period will last for about two months, from the southeast to the northwest, from irrigated land to rain-fed land. The wheat in the irrigated areas has begun to ripen, while the wheat in the mountainous areas is still heading, flowering, or filling.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 22nd: Spring wheat has generally begun to be harvested on the Hetao Plain, the Xiliao River Plain, and the Tumochuan Plain on the southern foothills of the Daqing Mountains in Inner Mongolia.

In the golden wheat sea of more than 500,000 mu on both sides of the Xiliao River, more than 100,000 farmers of all ethnic groups, cadres, and students are rushing to harvest every day. In Kailu County, in addition to leaving manpower for planting late crops and the late-stage management of autumn crops, more than 70% of the labor force has been invested in the wheat harvest. Some communes have adopted the method of "pulling nearby fields home to thresh, and threshing distant fields in the fields" to speed up the wheat harvest.

This year, the spring wheat on the Hetao Plain is growing very lush and strong. In many large-area high-yield fields, the wheat stalks are taller than the chest, the ears of wheat are up to three inches long, and the grains are full.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 21st: The rural areas south of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang are busy harvesting winter wheat and spring wheat. News of bumper harvests has been coming from various places.

In Yingjisha County, at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains and on the edge of the Great Gobi, 140,000 mu of winter wheat has yielded a bumper harvest. Now all the wheat in the county has been harvested and brought to the threshing ground, and 40,000 mu have been threshed. Among them, the output of the first-class wheat fields that have been threshed is more than 400 jin per mu, the general yield is about 300 jin per mu, and the worst yield is about 200 jin per mu. The average yield per mu has increased by 40% compared to last year.

In Shanshan County, at the foot of the Flaming Mountains in the Turpan Basin, both winter wheat and spring wheat have been harvested well this year. The Weixing People's Commune in Shanshan County, which has historically had low wheat yields, has seen a large-scale bumper harvest of wheat this year. The commune's 38,825 mu of wheat (including 12,149 mu of spring wheat), after trial threshing of the first, second, and third class wheat fields by production team, is estimated to have increased by about 50% compared to last year on average.

The bumper harvest of wheat in the Weixing People's Commune this year, in addition to the fact that the wheat field cultivation and management were more meticulous than in the past according to the requirements of the Eight-Character Charter, the most important thing is that the sowing of spring wheat was advanced by twenty days compared to last year, so that the wheat was filled and matured before the hottest weather, achieving full grains.

    辽宁吉林青海内蒙古农民挥镰收割春小麦
    据新华社沈阳22日电　辽宁省以春小麦为主的麦类作物，已经割了一半以上。目前产麦区农民正在“突击抢收，颗粒不丢”的口号下继续抢收，预计再有十天左右即可全部割完。
    今年辽宁省种植麦类作物一百零六万亩
  （其中春小麦七十六万亩，其余是冬小麦和大麦），比去年增加了76.6％。大部分麦田都进行了深耕和合理密植，麦田的施肥量也比去年增加。在冬麦灌浆和春麦拔节、孕穗时期，很多地区三、四十天未落雨。为了赢得小麦丰收，各地人民公社坚持不懈地进行了抗旱保苗斗争，一切有水源的地区，都对麦田灌了两三次水，同时注意了病虫害的防治工作。因此，各地小麦都长得穗大粒饱，呈现了丰收景象。
    各产麦区人民公社，根据今年小麦丰产，收获费工和正逢雨季等特点，在开镰前普遍调整了劳动组织，建立了责任制度，准备了充足的工具。麦收开始后，即集中人力抢割抢收，细割细收，麦收质量有了显著提高，损失浪费比往年大大减少。
    据新华社长春22日电　吉林省二百七十多万亩春小麦陆续黄熟。麦熟较早的扶余、通榆等县已经开镰收割。
    吉林省今年春小麦播种面积比去年增加了一点六倍，是历史上种麦最多的一年。播种前，90％以上的麦田深翻七寸以上，全部麦田都实行了合理密植；施肥量也比往年增加一倍到两倍。虽然今春全省久旱少雨，对小麦生长不利，但是由于各人民公社千方百计地挖掘水源，适时灌溉，终于战胜了干旱，小麦生长情况比往年还好。
    为了保证今年春小麦丰产丰收，各产麦区根据中共吉林省委和省人民委员会的指示，早就进行了麦收准备工作。种麦最多的白城地区各人民公社，已经备好镰刀四十万张，鐥刀五万张，和快速收割器、畜力牵引收割机、大车等准备适时投入抢收。大安县各公社接受了过去麦场平整晚了，麦子收割后不能及时运回的教训，今年已把大小场院完全提前整好，保证割净、拉净、拣净、打净，颗粒还家。
    据新华社西宁22日电　青海省循化、化隆、民和、乐都等农业地区川水地里的春麦和青稞开始黄熟，怀着丰收喜悦的各族农民已开镰收割。
    今年的庄稼长得确实好，刚刚开镰就传出了好些令人鼓舞的丰收喜讯。黄河边上化隆回族自治县哆吧公社牙什尕生产队，有十八亩春大麦平均亩产量比去年增加了两倍多。这片麦田实行了深翻，增施了底肥，追肥三次，浇水五次，除草三次，因而获得高产。社员们说，这是农业生产“八字宪法”在青海高原上开出的鲜花。
    青海省今年播种春麦和青稞四百多万亩。由于地形和气候不同，从东南部到西北部，从川水地到山旱地，收割期要绵延两个月左右。现在川地麦子开始黄熟，山地里的还正在吐穗或扬花灌浆。
    据新华社呼和浩特22日电　内蒙古河套平原、西辽河平原和大青山南麓的土默川平原，春小麦普遍开始收割。
    西辽河两岸五十多万亩金色的麦海里，每天有十万多各族农民、机关干部和学生在突击抢收。开鲁县除了留下种晚田和秋田后期管理的人力以外，70％以上的劳动力都已投入到麦收战线上来。有些公社采取“近地拉回家打、远地打野场”的办法，加快麦收进度。
    今年河套平原上的春小麦生长得十分茂密茁壮。许多大面积丰产地里，小麦株高过胸，麦穗长达三寸，籽粒饱满。
    新华社乌鲁木齐21日电　新疆天山以南农村正忙于收打冬小麦和春小麦。各地纷纷传来丰收消息。
    昆仑山下、大戈壁边上的英吉沙县，十四万亩冬小麦获得丰收。现在全县小麦都已收割登场，有四万亩已经脱粒。其中已脱粒的一类麦田产量在四百斤以上，一般亩产三百斤左右，最差的亩产二百斤左右。平均单产比去年增加了四成。
    吐鲁番盆地火焰山下的鄯善县今年冬小麦、春小麦都收得好。历年小麦低产的鄯善县卫星人民公社，今年小麦大面积丰收。全社三万八千八百二十五亩小麦（其中有春小麦一万二千一百四十九亩），经过以生产队为单位分一、二、三类麦田试打的结果，平均比去年约增产五成左右。
    卫星人民公社今年小麦丰收，除了麦田耕作和管理，根据八字宪法的要求作得比以往精细一些外，最重要的是春小麦的播种比去年提前了二十天，使小麦在天气最热以前就灌浆成熟，达到了颗粒饱满。（附图片）
