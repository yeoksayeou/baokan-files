From our correspondent in Hefei, 12th July: Light industrial factories in Wuhu City, Anhui Province, in the development of daily-use industrial products production, have adopted the method of mass "gap finding," identifying the gaps between advanced and backward in terms of operating techniques, equipment utilization, and raw material consumption, prompting the backward to catch up with the advanced, and the advanced to become even more advanced. In the first half of this year, the city's light industry output value (excluding handicraft factories and cooperatives) reached more than 54 million yuan, an increase of more than 21 million yuan over the same period last year. Of this, only more than 3.5 million yuan was produced by newly built and expanded factories this year, and the remaining more than 17 million yuan was increased by old factories tapping potential without substantially increasing equipment or personnel.

The method adopted by the light industrial factories in Wuhu City for "finding gaps" is as follows: First, fully mobilize employees to carefully check the situation in terms of operating techniques, equipment utilization, and raw material consumption. After the check, organize comparisons between the same types of work and the same processes. After the gaps are compared, carefully calculate the detailed accounts, and explain the significance of narrowing the gaps through detailed calculations. Then, find the reasons for the gaps and propose ways to narrow them. The main ways to narrow the gaps are to study and promote advanced production technologies, establish pacesetters in each production unit, and organize workers to carry out labor competitions to narrow the gaps, so that the productivity of points becomes the productivity of the entire area.

The "gap finding" method has played a significant role in tapping production potential. For example, in the rolling workshop of the Xinzhong Cigarette Factory, the effective machine time for a general rolling machine is only five hours and thirty minutes within eight hours. However, worker Yan Yuheng, due to achieving three fasts (fast legs, fast hands, fast eyes), two diligences (diligent oiling, diligent inspection), and one preparation (preparing tools), the effective machine time of the rolling machine he operates reaches seven hours fifteen minutes to seven hours twenty minutes. After the factory promoted Yan Yuheng's experience in tending machines, the effective machine time of the entire rolling workshop generally increased to around seven hours. The Guanghua Glass Factory used the method of finding gaps to discover many production technology rules, solved the technical problems that previously affected the quality of thermos bottles, and the first-class product rate of thermos bottles this year increased from 98% last year to 99.32%, exceeding the national regulations. The Wuhu Textile Factory adopted the form of production skill selection competitions to establish advanced banners and set off a wave of competition to catch up with each other. In the first half of the year, a total of more than 82,000 kilograms of raw cotton was saved. These raw cottons can be used to spin 428 pieces of cotton yarn.

In the "gap finding" movement, the light industrial factories in Wuhu City also created and improved 499 kinds of tools. The efficiency of these tools can be increased several times to dozens of times in most cases.

### 把点的丰产变成面的丰产  芜湖轻工业工厂通过“找差距”提高生产水平

    把点的丰产变成面的丰产
    芜湖轻工业工厂通过“找差距”提高生产水平
    本报合肥12日电　安徽省芜湖市各轻工业工厂，在发展日用工业品生产中，采取群众性“找差距”的办法，找出先进与落后之间在操作技术、设备利用和原材料消耗等方面的差距，促使落后的赶先进，先进的更先进。今年上半年，全市轻工业产值（不包括手工业厂、社）达到五千四百多万元，比去年同期增加了二千一百多万元。其中只有三百五十多万元是由今年新建和扩建的工厂生产的，其余的一千七百多万元，都是在基本上没有增加设备、人员的情况下，靠老厂挖掘潜力增产的。
    芜湖市各轻工业工厂“找差距”的办法是：首先充分发动职工仔细地检查操作技术、设备利用和原材料消耗等方面的情况，检查以后组织同工种、同工序之间作比较，在差距比较出来以后，再认真地算细账，通过算细账说明缩小差距的意义，接着寻找出现差距的原因，提出缩小差距的办法。缩小差距的办法，主要是研究和推广先进的生产技术，在每个生产单位里树立标兵，组织工人开展缩小差距的劳动竞赛，使点的丰产成为面的丰产。
    “找差距”的办法对挖掘生产潜力起了很大作用。如新中烟厂卷制车间，一般卷制机八小时内的有效台时只有五点三十分，但是工人严玉衡，由于做到三快（腿快、手快、眼快）、二勤（勤上油、勤检查）、一准备（准备好工具），他操纵的一台卷制机，有效台时达到七点十五分到七点二十分。这个厂把严玉衡的档车经验推广以后，全卷制车间的有效台时普遍提高到七点左右。光华玻璃厂用找差距的办法摸出了许多生产技术上的规律，解决了过去影响水瓶质量的技术问题，今年的水瓶正品率由去年的98％提高到99.32％，超过了国家规定的指标。芜湖纺织厂采用生产能手选拔赛的形式，树立先进的旗帜，掀起你追我赶的竞赛热潮，上半年一共节约原棉八万二千多公斤。把这些原棉用来纺纱可以纺棉纱四百二十八件。
    芜湖市轻工业工厂在“找差距”运动中，还创造和改进了四百九十九种工具。这些工具的工效，大部分可以提高几倍到几十倍。
