Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 9th - Anshan Iron and Steel's various steel rolling mills have strengthened equipment maintenance and repair work. After tapping the potential of existing equipment, the average daily output of steel in the first seven days of July increased by 625 tons compared to the average daily output in June.

　　In the first half of this year, Anshan Iron and Steel's total steel output increased by 24.3% compared to the same period last year. The various steel rolling mills produced a total of more than 5,500 specifications of steel, supporting more than 2,000 enterprises and units nationwide.

　　However, the equipment maintenance and repair work was not done well enough, which affected the further increase in steel output. In the third quarter, Anshan Iron and Steel Company decided to vigorously strengthen the equipment maintenance and repair work of the steel rolling system. The company uniformly reviewed the equipment overhaul plans of various steel rolling mills, requiring the three machine repair plants to prioritize the manufacturing of spare parts for equipment maintenance in the various steel rolling mills, and transferred a group of equipment maintenance personnel from various plants, under the unified leadership of the company's construction department, responsible for the overhaul work of the steel rolling mills.

　　Various steel rolling mills generally conducted education on equipment care for production workers, and organized equipment maintenance and repair workers to carry out competitions. The First Blooming Mill formed an equipment inspection team to inspect and identify the plant's important equipment item by item. If any place needed to be repaired, it was immediately repaired. From July 1st to 7th, the equipment effective operation rate of this factory increased by an average of 11% compared to June, and the billet production exceeded the plan by 1,322 tons. The Medium Section Mill conscientiously implemented the system of regular equipment maintenance, and assigned dedicated personnel to be responsible for the maintenance and repair of each equipment and each unit. Hundreds of equipment maintenance and repair workers at the Second Medium Plate Mill held a mobilization rally and competition, guaranteeing the normal operation of the plant's equipment.

　　Now, the various steel rolling mills are preparing to further carry out inter-factory collaborative competitions around increasing steel production. On July 4th, the representatives of the Second Medium Plate Mill had already sent the competition guarantee conditions for the third quarter to the First Medium Plate Mill, their old rival in the competition.

　　Jinan, this newspaper, 9th - Shandong People's Broadcasting Station news: The broad masses of workers on the steel front in Shandong Province, on the basis of achieving high-quality and high-yield results in the first half of the year, are taking measures to further improve management levels, carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, and strive to create new achievements to welcome the 10th anniversary of the National Day. The iron produced in Shandong Province in the first half of the year increased by 123 times compared to the same period last year, and the steel produced increased by 3.7 times. The quality of steel has improved even more significantly. In June, the average qualified rate of pig iron reached 74.5%, and the qualified rate of steel's sulfur content increased to over 93%. The cost of steel production has also decreased significantly.

　　At present, the steel workers across the province, according to the instructions of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee's June Secretary Meeting, are summarizing the experience of the first half of the year, deeply discussing the third quarter plan, studying and promoting effective measures for high-quality and high-yield, and striving to create greater achievements to dedicate to the National Day. As early as June, the steel plants in Qingdao seized the opportunity to overhaul the machinery and equipment of the blast furnaces and converters, respectively, to prepare good conditions for the production in the third quarter. In addition to promoting multi-nozzle combustion and other technical experiences in various plants in the Changwei area, a three-cubic-meter small blast furnace was selected in Weifang Steel Plant No. 4 for a comprehensive technical transformation experiment. The experimental effect has been very good in the past half month. The qualified rate of pig iron has reached 100%, and the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace has reached an average of 1.4 or more.

　　The mining, coking, and transportation departments in various parts of Shandong are also conducting the movement to increase production and practice economy in depth, continuously improving production efficiency, and creating conditions for the high-quality and high-yield of steel production.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 9th - The workers of Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant, which had already changed its backward production situation in the second quarter, recently further proposed the slogan "Catch up with Gang, surpass Anshan Iron and Steel, and produce more grade-one steel," determined to increase the steel production level by 3.4% compared to the second quarter in the third quarter, and to achieve a qualified rate of steel ingots of over 98% in July. All qualified steel ingots are required to be grade-one steel.

　　Now, the labor competition of "high quality, high yield, long life, no accidents" in this factory is in full swing. Qi Zisheng's group, a Tianjin municipal model from Open Hearth No. 1, has continuously smelted all grade-one steel for twenty consecutive days, and Wang Qifa's group from Open Hearth No. 2 has not produced any waste products for more than thirty consecutive days. Other steelmaking groups are not willing to lag behind and are learning from these advanced groups. The factory's leading cadres and technicians have formed professional teams to summarize the operating experience of advanced groups in open hearth furnaces, pig iron furnaces, gas furnaces, steel casting and other sections. Based on these advanced experiences, combined with the old process regulations and responsibility systems, they are mobilizing the masses to discuss the establishment and improvement of various enterprise management systems.

　　In the first quarter, the utilization coefficient of open hearth furnaces in Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant was only 4.43, and the qualified rate of steel ingots was only 70.9%. In April, a propaganda picture of a race between nine steel plants in the country using open hearth steelmaking was posted in the factory: running at the front was Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, which had the highest utilization coefficient of open hearth furnaces and completed the plan best, followed by Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, Anshan No. 1 Steelmaking Plant, etc. Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant was at the end. The workers were very excited after seeing this picture and were determined to catch up. The factory director, the heads of the steelmaking department's Party, government, and trade union organizations, and engineers all went deep into the workshops to follow production and effectively strengthened the leadership on the front line of production; the workers launched a production increase and economy campaign centered on improving quality. Production began to rise that month. In June, while completing the output plan ahead of schedule, the factory's qualified rate of steel ingots reached 98.54%, of which grade-one steel accounted for 70.11%. The utilization coefficient of open hearth furnaces ranked fourth among the nine major steel plants. (Attached picture)
