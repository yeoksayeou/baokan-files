Planting Inter-Row Green Manure Achieves Two Goals at Once
Sichuan's Santai County Proves: Intercropping Leguminous Crops in Corn and Sweet Potato Fields Can Increase Grain Production and Green Manure Harvests.

Chengdu, July 16th (Report from our newspaper) A good method that can solve topdressing issues for major spring crops and increase grain production at the same time—increasing inter-row green manure planting—is being widely promoted in Santai County, Sichuan Province. The county has planted green beans, soybeans, and sword beans, among other leguminous crops used as green manure, in 160,000 mu of sweet potato and corn fields, accounting for nearly 60% of the total planting area for sweet potatoes and corn. It is estimated that this summer, the county will harvest over 52.2 million jin of green manure, enough to meet the topdressing needs of over 65,000 mu of autumn-harvested crops. At the same time, it will also harvest over 3.8 million jin of beans, achieving a double harvest of fertilizer and grain.

Santai is located in the hilly area of northern Sichuan, with barren and drought-prone soil. Local farmers have traditionally intercropped leguminous crops in sweet potato and corn fields to accumulate fertilizer, improve the soil, resist drought, and increase grain production. This year, the planting area for inter-row green manure has been expanded, and the work started earlier than in previous years. The Sanyuan People's Commune planted green beans between the rows before the sweet potatoes were planted; the Anju People's Commune planted corn and beans at the same time. Currently, these inter-row green manure crops are lush, leafy, and growing well.

The long-term practice of farmers in Santai County has proven that planting green manure crops between rows of sweet potatoes and corn is a method of accumulating fertilizer that is plentiful, fast, good, and economical. Intercropping these green manure crops in sweet potato and corn fields can greatly increase land utilization. At the same time, the dense foliage of the green manure can reduce soil moisture evaporation, enhance drought resistance, prevent soil erosion, and inhibit weed growth, thereby further promoting the normal growth of sweet potatoes and corn. In addition, the rhizobia of leguminous crops also have the function of fixing nitrogen from the air; for example, planting one mu of green beans can fix about ten jin of nitrogen, with a fertilizer effect equivalent to fifty jin of ammonium sulfate. Leguminous crops have a short growing period, generally requiring only forty to fifty days to harvest, while sweet potatoes and corn do not grow luxuriantly and tall during the forty to fifty days after planting, so they do not affect each other. The stems and leaves of leguminous crops have a very high fertilizer effect; soaking thirty jin of fresh stems and leaves in one load of night soil is equivalent to the fertilizer effect of one load of medium-quality human and animal manure. This method of accumulating fertilizer requires less investment and yields greater results. Each mu only requires four to five jin of seeds and can yield seven hundred to one thousand jin of fresh stems and leaves for making green fertilizer, which is equivalent to two thousand to four thousand jin of liquid manure, and it requires much less labor than general grass cutting for composting.

### 种植行间绿肥一举两得  三台县经验证明：在玉米、红薯地间种豆科作物，能增产粮食，又能增收绿肥。

    种植行间绿肥一举两得
    三台县经验证明：在玉米、红薯地间种豆科作物，能增产粮食，又能增收绿肥。
    本报成都16日电　一种既能解决大春作物追肥，又可增收粮食的好方法——增种行间绿肥，正在四川省三台县广泛推行。全县有十六万亩红薯、玉米地间种了绿豆、毛豆和刀豆等兼作绿肥的豆科作物，占红薯、玉米种植总面积的近60％。据估计，今年夏季全县收得的绿肥将达五千二百多万斤，可满足六万五千多亩秋熟作物的追肥需要；同时还将收获三百八十多万斤豆类，作到肥料、粮食两丰收。
    三台位于四川北部丘陵地带，土质瘠薄易旱。当地农民为了积造肥料、改良土壤、抗御干旱并增收一些粮食，历来就有在红薯、玉米地里间种豆科作物的习惯。今年行间绿肥的种植面积扩大了，动手时间也比往年早。三元人民公社，早在红薯尚未栽种的时候，便在厢间点种了绿豆；安居人民公社将玉米和豆类同时间种。目前这些行间绿肥作物都枝繁叶茂，生长良好。
    三台县农民群众历年的实践证明，在红薯、玉米行间种植绿肥作物，是一种多、快、好、省的积造肥料的办法。因为在红薯、玉米地里间种这类绿肥作物，可以大大提高土地的利用率；同时，由于绿肥枝叶茂密，可以减少土壤水分蒸发，增强抗旱能力，防止土壤冲刷，并能抑制杂草滋生，从而更有利于红薯、玉米的正常生长。此外，豆科作物的根瘤菌还有固定空气中的氮素的作用，如绿豆种植一亩就能固定氮素十斤左右，肥效相当于五十斤硫酸錏。豆科作物生长时间短，一般只需四、五十天就可收获；而红薯、玉米在栽种后的四、五十天期间生长还不繁茂高大，不会互相影响。豆科作物的茎叶肥效很高，每三十斤鲜茎叶泡一挑水粪，可相当于一挑中等人畜粪的肥效。这种积造肥料的办法投资较小，收效大。每亩只需用种四斤至五斤，就可收得七百至一千斤鲜茎叶泡制青肥，能抵上二千至四千斤水粪，并比一般割草沤肥所需的劳动力大大减少。　（李绍中）
