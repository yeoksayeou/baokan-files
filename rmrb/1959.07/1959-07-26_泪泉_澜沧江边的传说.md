    Tear Spring
    ——A Legend by the Lancang River

    On the high Sanda Mountain, a stone cliff rises abruptly, covered by a tall magnolia tree like a large umbrella. Two streams of clear spring water spurt out from the cliff. Every day, the sun wakes up from the sea of mist and is the first to soak in the spring water to wash its face. Legend has it that this beautiful stone cliff is the embodiment of a passionate maiden. Every night, she and her lover lay among these flowers. Time passed in wind and rain for a year. One day, the young man who loved her went hunting in the distant mountains and never returned. She stood on this high mountain, waiting for seven hundred and seventy-seven days. Unfortunately, the young man was injured by a rhinoceros. Before his death, he entrusted a white wagtail bird to bring an arrow to the girl's side. The girl picked up the crossbow and cut open her grieving heart, and two streams of spring water gushed from her eyes. Instantly, she fainted on the mountain. Time passed in legend for a thousand years, and her loyal love transformed her into a mountain rock, with two streams of tears forever spraying towards the blue sky. Below the mountain is a Dai village. There is an ancient rule in the village: as long as the setting sun kisses the rock, the girl must draw back a pot of spring water and use it to brew tea at night to treat her lover, letting him taste whether the spring water is sour or sweet.

    泪泉
    ——澜沧江边的传说
    陈贵培在高高的三达山上突起一堵石岩，一棵高大的缅桂花树，像一顶大伞把它复盖，石岩上喷出二股清泉，太阳每天从雾海里醒来，第一个泡在泉水里洗脸。传说这堵好看的石岩，是一个多情少女的化身，每夜她和小伙子躺在这片
  花间，时间在风雨中过了一年，一天爱她的小伙子，到远山打猎没有回来，她站在这座高山上，等待了七百七十七天。不幸小伙子被犀牛伤害，临死前他托白鷼鸟，把一只箭带到姑娘身边，姑娘拿起弩箭，把自己悲痛的心截开，眼里冒出两股清泉，顷时她昏倒在山间。时间在传说中过了一千年，忠贞的爱情使她化作山岩，两股泪泉永远喷向蓝天。山下是一片傣族村寨，寨里有一个古规，只要夕阳吻着山岩，姑娘就要汲回一罐泉水，夜晚用来煮茶把情人款待，让他尝尝泉水是酸是甜。
