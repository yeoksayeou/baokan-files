Song of Weeding

In May, the south of the Yangtze River is lush and green,
The silkworms are old, and the loquats are yellow.
The "dong-ji-zi" bird's song urges weeding,
Quickly put on your new straw hat.
Looking into the distance, the rice seedlings resemble cloud tops,
The weeding people walk in the clouds.
The fluttering red flag teases people:
Hurry up, strive to be a red banner bearer.
The hoe runs, the weeds fall,
The paddy water smiles,
In the vast fields, not a single seedling is harmed.
Without a heart that loves the commune,
How could the hands be so skillful?
The weeding people sing their own songs, happy and carefree,
Letting the sweat flow down their faces,
In the autumn, there will be fields full of white jade,
Hey, one part of effort, one part of harvest.

    耘田曲
    严阵五月江南碧苍苍，蚕老枇杷黄，咚鸡子声声催薅秧，快把新草帽儿戴上。远望秧棵好像云头，耘田人在云彩里走，呼啦啦的红旗把人逗：快加油，争取当红旗手。?头跑，草儿倒，田水笑，万顷田里不伤一棵苗，没有爱社的一片心，手儿怎能这么巧？耘田人自编自唱乐悠悠，任凭汗水顺脸流，秋后自有满田白玉，嗨，一成功夫一成收。
