    Taking the Road of Comprehensive Utilization
    Xue Wenfang

    The Guanghua Timber Factory in Beijing is a large-scale wood processing plant. Those familiar with the factory know that in the past two years, the utilization rate of wood was very low. At that time, there were truly "mountains of scraps and firewood everywhere." Although the workers had studied some methods to improve wood utilization and eliminate scraps, they did not save much wood because the direction was wrong.

    Later, based on several years of production experience, the factory gradually realized that the fundamental reason for the low wood utilization rate was the simplicity of the products. Under the leadership of the Party committee and relevant departments, they began to take the road of comprehensive wood utilization, and the phenomenon of wasting wood was fundamentally changed.

    Turning Scraps and Fragments into Great Things

    When you sit in the sleeper car produced by the Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant and see the beige carriage with beautiful patterns, you might think it is made of the best wood with a large diameter. In fact, it is the carriage panel made by the Guanghua Timber Factory using scrap slats and thin layers of good wood, heat-pressed with synthetic resin. This kind of fine wood carriage panel is not only beautiful but also has the advantages of not cracking or deforming. In some high-rise buildings in the capital, you will see a beautiful, strong, and durable parquet floor. This floor is also made of scraps. These two products alone can prevent more than 1,000 cubic meters of scraps from being discarded each year.

    The leftovers from the plywood workshop—scraps—used to be the most troublesome. They not only occupied the only open space around the workshop, but also flew around in windy seasons; in the rainy season, they would constantly mildew and deteriorate, endangering the safety and hygiene of the factory. Last year, they used the methods of hard work and diligent effort to form a small-scale plywood production section. Dozens of family members quickly learned the technology of producing small boards under the guidance of experienced workers. Through their hard work, mountains of scrap veneers were turned into neat small-sized plywood. After using up the accumulated scrap boards, they found a small rotary lathe and re-cut the wood cores turned down by the large workshop for the second time, reducing them from the original 14 cm to 6 cm. Each shift can turn out 2 to 3 cubic meters of veneer. This measure ensured the raw material supply for this section, and the quality of the small boards reached the grade standards stipulated by the Ministry of Forestry. The wood cores turned to a thickness of 6 cm are then planed into wood wool by a wood wool machine for the export company as packaging materials. This has increased the wood utilization rate of the plywood workshop from about 46% in the past to 54%.

      Turning Sawdust and Shavings into Good Materials

    Comprehensive wood utilization cannot rely solely on mechanical processing; it must be carried out in conjunction with chemical processing. This can not only turn inferior materials into good materials and small materials into large materials, but also process large amounts of waste materials—sawdust and shavings—into high-value products. With the strong support of the Ministry of Forestry, the Guanghua Timber Factory, under the organization of the Ministry and the factory's Communist Youth League, built a "Communist Youth League Hydrolysis Workshop" through voluntary labor. This workshop is now basically ready and will soon be able to use sawdust to produce a large amount of industrial alcohol. The alcohol yield of sawdust is similar to that of potatoes. This not only increases the country's material wealth but also saves the country's grain. The residual liquid and residue after alcohol production can also be used to produce dry ice, lignin, wood coal, and other by-products. In addition, sawdust can also be made into bakelite powder and activated carbon. The factory's indigenous and foreign combined bakelite powder workshop now has a daily output of about two tons.

    Shavings are also an inevitable waste material in the wood processing process. In order to turn shavings into good materials, they built a new artificial board workshop. After the workshop is completed, the shavings can be turned into beautiful artificial boards through processes such as screening, mixing with glue, and hot pressing. This kind of artificial board has the advantages of large area, no splicing, sound insulation, and water resistance, and can be used to replace natural wood in general applications.

    走综合利用的路
    薛文芳
    北京市光华木材厂是一个大型的木材加工厂。熟悉这个厂的人们都知道，这个厂在前二年木材的利用率是很低的。那时真是“碎料成山，劈柴遍地”。职工们虽然研究过一些提高木材利用率和消灭碎料的办法，但是由于方向不对头，节约的木材总是不多。
    后来，这个厂根据几年来的生产经验，逐渐认识到木材利用率低的根本原因是产品单纯。他们在党委和上级有关部门的领导下，开始走上了木材综合利用的道路，浪费木材的现象才得到根本性的改变。
    碎料、碎片成大器
    当你坐在四方机车车辆厂出品的寝车上，看到那米黄色的有着美丽花纹的车厢，也许会认为那是用最好的直径很大的木材做成的。其实，那就是光华木材厂利用碎板条和薄薄的两层好木片，用人造树脂热压制成的车厢板。这种细木工车厢板不仅美观，而且具有不开裂不变形的优点。在首都某些高楼大厦里，你会看到一种美观、坚固、耐用的拼花地板。这种地板也是用碎料作成的。仅只这两种产品，一年就可以使一千多立方米碎料不再废弃。
    胶合板车间的下脚料——碎片，过去是最令人头痛的。它不仅占据了车间周围仅有的空地，在多风的季节里还会满天飞舞；到了雨季，又不断地发霉变质，妨害着工厂的安全和卫生。去年，他们用穷干、苦干的方法，组成了一个制造小规格胶合板工段。几十名家属在老师傅的辅导下，迅速地学会了生产小板的技术。通过她们的辛勤劳动，堆积如山的碎单板变成了整齐的小规格的胶合板。吃光了积存的碎板之后，她们又找来了一台小镟车，把大车间镟下的木芯再进行第二次镟切，由原来的十四公分镟细到六公分，每一个班可以镟出二到三立方米的单板。这一措施保证了这一工段的原料供应，小板的质量也达到了林业部规定的等级标准。镟细到六公分的木芯再通过木丝机刨成木丝供出口公司作包装材料。这样就使得胶合板车间的木材利用率由过去的46％左右提高到54％。
      锯屑、刨花变良材
    全面的木材综合利用，只靠机械加工是不够的，必须与化学加工同时并举。这样不仅能将次材变好材，小材变大材，而且能将大量的废料——锯屑和刨花处理成价值很高的产品。光华木材厂在林业部的大力支持下，由部和厂的共青团组织全体青年用义务劳动修建了一个“共青团水解车间”。这个车间目前已经基本就绪，不久就可以利用锯屑生产出大量的工业用酒精。锯屑的出酒率和马铃薯差不多。这样一方面给国家增加了物质财富，另一方面也给国家节约了粮食。出过酒精的残液残渣还可以生产干冰、木素、木煤等副产品。另外锯屑还可以制成电木粉和活性炭。这个厂土洋结合的电木粉车间，现在日产量已经达到两吨左右。
    刨花也是木材加工过程中必然产生的一种废料。为了将刨花变成好材，他们新建了一座人造板车间。这个车间建成后，刨花经过筛选、拌胶、热压等过程，就可以变成美观的人造板。这种人造板具有面积大、无拼接、隔音、抗水等优点，一般应用天然木材的地方都可以用它来代替。（附图片）
    北京光华木材厂工人们，把镟车的轴心改组以后，每年可给国家节约四百多立方米木材。
