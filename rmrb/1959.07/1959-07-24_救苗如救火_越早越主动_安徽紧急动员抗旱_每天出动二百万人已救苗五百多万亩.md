Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 23rd: Anhui Province is urgently mobilizing to combat and prevent drought, deploying over 2.1 million people daily. As of July 19th, over 5 million mu of drought-stricken crops have been irrigated.

Since June, most areas in Anhui Province north of the Yangtze River and excluding Anqing Prefecture have experienced little rainfall, leading to varying degrees of drought. Currently, the climate is dry with high evaporation, and the drought situation continues to expand. As of July 19th, the total drought-affected area in the province reached over 10 million mu, mainly in the hilly regions between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, as well as Yingshang, Fengtai, Funan, Mengcheng, Fuyang, Huaiyuan, Fengyang and other counties in the Huaibei area. Wuwei, Hanshan, He County, Nanling and other counties in the Wuhu Prefecture also face varying degrees of drought. Among the drought-affected cultivated land, over 2 million mu are experiencing more severe drought due to lack of water sources.

Based on the characteristic of frequent low rainfall in Anhui Province during summer and autumn, the province established drought prevention headquarters and command posts from top to bottom as early as late May, making preparations in terms of ideology and materials. When signs of drought emerged, various localities immediately strengthened drought prevention and resistance work, pointing out that mid-season rice is currently at the stem elongation and heading stage, and drought-resistant crops are also about to flower and bear fruit, making it a crucial time for water needs. They emphasized that saving seedlings from drought is like fighting fire – the sooner, the more proactive, and the more beneficial, launching a mass campaign to combat drought and protect seedlings. Recently, the province has been deploying over 2.18 million people daily, along with over 890 water pumps, 708,000 waterwheels and other water-lifting tools, digging over 32,100 irrigation ditches, building over 2,900 dams, and digging over 4,700 wells and other projects, working day and night to draw water and irrigate seedlings. Party secretaries at all levels in the Fuyang area have gone to the grassroots level to take responsibility for specific areas, leading drought resistance efforts. Funan County has quickly rescued over 672,000 mu of drought-affected crops, accounting for 77% of the drought-affected area. The broad masses in Bengbu Prefecture are in high spirits, vowing the heroic oath of "No matter how dry the weather may be, we must seize an autumn harvest!" More than 500,000 people are drawing water and resisting drought daily, having already saved one million mu of seedlings. In the severely drought-stricken Huoqiu County, the 200,000-strong drought resistance army was divided into two groups, one for water wheel operation and the other for rushing to plant sweet potatoes. By early July, they had rushed to plant 110,000 mu of sweet potatoes and irrigated 160,000 mu of dryland and paddy crops.

According to meteorological department forecasts, the possibility of rainfall in Anhui Province in the near future is very low, and the drought situation will continue to develop. Therefore, drought-affected areas are further mobilizing all forces, actively exploring water sources, and fully utilizing all water-lifting tools to prepare for further drought resistance. Non-drought-affected areas are also strengthening water storage and conservation and water-saving efforts, actively preventing drought.

    救苗如救火　越早越主动
    安徽紧急动员抗旱
    每天出动二百万人已救苗五百多万亩
    新华社合肥23日电　安徽省各地正在紧急动员起来抗旱、防旱，每天出动抗旱的人力达二百一十多万人。到7月19日止，已有五百多万亩受旱作物得到灌溉。
    自6月份以来，安徽省除长江以南和安庆专区外，淮南和淮北大部分地区少雨，出现了不同程度的旱象。目前气候干燥，蒸发量大，旱情仍在继续扩展。到7月19日统计，全省受旱面积已达一千多万亩，主要是长江淮河之间的丘陵地区，以及淮北地区的颍上、凤台、阜南、蒙城、阜阳、怀远、凤阳等县。芜湖专区的无为、含山、和县、南陵等县也有不同程度的旱情。受旱耕地中，有二百多万亩因缺乏水源，旱情比较严重。
    根据安徽省夏秋常常雨少的特点，早在5月下旬起，全省就从上到下建立起防旱指挥部、指挥所，从思想上、物质上各方面做了准备。当旱象露头后，各地立即加强了防旱抗旱工作，指出当前中稻已圆秆孕穗，旱粮作物也将要开花结实，正是需水时期，说明抗旱救苗如救火，越早越主动，越有利，发动群众迅速掀起了抗旱保苗运动。最近，全省每天出动二百一十八万多人，八百九十多台抽水机，七十万八千多台水车和其他抽水工具，开出引水沟三万二千一百多条，打水坝二千九百多座，挖井和其他工程四千七百多处，日夜提水浇苗。阜阳地区各级党委书记都到基层划片包干，领导抗旱。阜南县已迅速抢救了六十七万二千多亩受旱作物，占受旱面积的77％。蚌埠专区广大群众斗志昂扬，立下了“不管怎样天干地旱，也要夺取秋季丰收”的英雄誓言，每天有五十多万人车水抗旱，已救苗一百万亩。旱情较重的霍丘县，把二十万抗旱大军分作车水和抢栽山芋两套组织，到7月上旬已抢栽山芋十一万亩，浇灌水旱作物十六万亩。
    根据气象部门预测，安徽省最近期间降雨的可能性很小，旱情还会继续发展。因此，已旱地区正在进一步动员一切力量，积极挖掘水源，充分利用一切提水工具，准备进一步抗旱；未旱地区也在加强蓄水保水和节约用水工作，积极防旱。
