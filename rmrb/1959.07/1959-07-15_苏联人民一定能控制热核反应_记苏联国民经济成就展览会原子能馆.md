The section on thermonuclear reaction research in the newly added Atomic Energy Pavilion of the Soviet National Economic Achievements Exhibition has particularly attracted the attention of visitors. Millions of foreign and Soviet visitors here have gained a firm conviction: the Soviet people will surely be able to control thermonuclear reactions, and mankind will therefore surely be able to eliminate worries about the depletion of Earth's energy resources.

This is the most interesting part of the exhibition. Indeed, when we walk in, we feel as if we have entered the world-renowned Soviet Thermonuclear Energy Research Institute. Those devices whose names we have heard but whose details we do not know are presented before us. Inside some of the devices, we see a halo like a silver ribbon flowing rapidly, with sparks flashing within the silver ring. Everything here introduces in detail several methods of the Soviet Union for controlling thermonuclear energy.

A completely realistic, working pulsed device with a ceramic discharge chamber occupies a considerable area of the exhibition room. The shape of this device is somewhat like a large, special stove. When the staff went to the console and turned on the switch, the pointers on the measuring instruments kept moving, and a loud explosive sound was heard. At this time, the discharge current in the discharge chamber reached 250,000 amperes. The Soviet Atomic Energy Institute obtained neutron flow for the first time in such a discharge gas as early as 1952. The temperature inside the discharge chamber has reached millions of degrees. The appearance of neutron flow is a sign that a thermonuclear reaction may occur.

From here, the audience began to understand how arduous the cause of controlling thermonuclear reactions is. It turns out that a thermonuclear reaction is the merging of the nuclei of heavy hydrogen atoms into helium nuclei. In this process, a large amount of energy is released. Heavy hydrogen is an inexhaustible fuel in the world. Heavy hydrogen is everywhere, but there is no such engine in the world that can use such fuel. Soviet scholars want to manufacture such a special engine.

The exhibits in the exhibition room tell the audience: Soviet scholars have already found the principle of manufacturing this special engine. The matter is like this: the nuclei of heavy hydrogen atoms are unwilling to merge. To overcome the resistance of the atomic nuclei, the nuclei must be accelerated and made to collide with each other at extremely high speeds. To do this, the atomic nuclei must have a temperature of several million or even higher. At a temperature of millions of degrees, heavy hydrogen becomes a highly ionized state, called the plasma state. What can be used to control the plasma state at a temperature of millions of degrees? Soviet scholars have proposed that a device with an electromagnetic field can achieve this goal.

The pictures displayed in the exhibition room and the films shown explain that since the method of using electromagnetic fields was found, the foundation for controlling thermonuclear reactions has been laid. Since then, more than one device, that is, more than one method, has been created. These devices and methods are roughly divided into three types. The ceramic pulse discharge device is one of them.

In the middle of the exhibition room is a model of a device called "Alpha". With this device, a more stable plasma state of heavy hydrogen can be obtained than with a ceramic pulse power generation device. This device is composed of many storage batteries and a powerful discharge device. The discharge device here is a ring composed of a vacuum chamber with an average diameter of more than three meters. The energy of the storage battery that transmits current reaches 1.5 million joules. From the outside, this device looks like a power station or an accelerator for studying microparticles.

On the adjacent exhibition stand is an anatomical model of a vacuum ring, with a silver band circulating endlessly in the vacuum. This silver band is the range of activity of hydrogen atoms in the plasma state. This band is constantly discharging, hydrogen atoms are constantly colliding, and the temperature is constantly increasing. This band is governed by invisible walls, powerful electromagnetic fields, so that the microparticles inside do not run away and the temperature does not dissipate.

Another device that can possibly control thermonuclear reactions, the adiabatic trap, can also be seen in the exhibition room. The famous "Ogra" device is built according to the principle of the adiabatic trap. The staff told us: if the previous two devices can be compared to samovars, then this adiabatic trap-type thermonuclear reaction device is a bit like a "thermos flask". Accelerated hydrogen ions are injected into the trap from the accelerator, just like pouring hot water into a thermos flask. The strong magnetic field of the trap is not formed by internal discharge, but by external magnetic field coils. Accelerated, high-temperature hydrogen ions oscillate back and forth between the "magnetic plugs" at both ends of the trap, constantly colliding with each other until a thermonuclear reaction occurs.

These exhibits in the exhibition room illustrate that it is entirely possible to turn the hydrogen bomb, which threatens mankind, from an explosive thermonuclear reaction into a controllable thermonuclear reaction. Soviet scholars are once again at the forefront of countries in the world in this regard.

On the wall of the exhibition room hangs a huge picture of surging seawater, which is to tell visitors that the fuel for these complex devices displayed here in the future will be worthless and inexhaustible seawater. The staff told us with excited words: the energy contained in one liter of ordinary water is equal to the energy of four hundred liters of gasoline. The energy contained in one cup of heavy water is approximately equal to the energy contained in thousands of tons of coal. After controlling thermonuclear energy, mankind can create artificial suns that illuminate the Arctic night and fly out of the solar system. After visiting the Atomic Energy Pavilion, we believe that with the efforts of Soviet scholars, the arrival of this day is not far away. (Attached picture)

    苏联人民一定能控制热核反应
    ——记苏联国民经济成就展览会原子能馆
    本报记者　李楠
    苏联国民经济成就展览会新增设的原子能馆中，研究热核反应的部门特别引起观众的注意。千千万万的外国和苏联观众在这里获得了一个坚定的信心：苏联人民一定能够控制热核反应，人类也因此一定能够解除对于地球能源枯竭的忧虑。
    这是展览会中最有兴趣的一部分。的确，当我们走进去之后，我们会感觉似乎是走进了名扬四海的苏联研究热核能的研究所，那些我们曾听到过名称但不知究竟的装置，就呈现在我们面前。在一些装置里面，我们看到像一根银色带子一样的光环在迅速流动，火花在银环内闪灼。这里的一切陈列品详尽地介绍了苏联控制热核能的几种方法。
    一个完全真实的，能实际工作的带有陶磁放电室的脉冲装置占了展览室相当大的一块地方。这个装置的外形有点像大型的特殊的炉灶。当工作人员走上操纵台打开了电纽时，计算仪器上的指针不断移动，一声强烈的爆烈声音传来。这时放电室内的放电电流达到了二十五万安培。苏联原子能研究所还在1952年就在这种放电气体中第一次获得了中子流。放电室内的温度已达百万度。出现了中子流这就是可能出现热核反应的标志。
    从这里，观众开始了解到要控制热核反应的事业是多么的艰巨。原来热核反应就是使重氢的原子核合并成氦的原子核，在这过程中放出大量的能，重氢是世界上用之不竭的燃料。重氢到处都有，但现在世界上都还没有一部这样的发动机能够用得上这样的燃料。苏联的学者们就是要制造这样特殊的发动机。
    展览室的展览品告诉观众：制造这种特殊发动机的原理苏联学者已经找到了。事情是这样：重氢的原子核并不愿意合并。要克服原子核的抗拒力量只有把原子核加速，使之以极大的速度互相乱冲乱撞。要办到这，又必须要使原子核有几百万乃至更高的温度才行。重氢在几百万度的高温下就变成了高度的电离状态，叫做等离子状态。用甚么东西可以控制得住几百万度的温度的等离子状态呢？苏联学者们提出用带电磁场的装置可以到达这一目的。
    在展览室陈列的图片和放映的电影说明：自从找到了用带电磁场的方法以后，才奠定了控制热核反应的基础。以后，不止一种装置，也就是说不止一种方法被创造出来。这些装置和方法大体又分为三种。陶器脉冲放电装置就是其中的一种。
    在展览室的中间陈列着一种叫做“阿尔法”的装置的模型。用这种装置可以获得比陶器脉冲发电装置更稳定的等离子状态的重氢。这种装置是由许多蓄电器和一个强大的放电器组成的，这里的放电器是一种平均直径三公尺多的真空室所组成的环圈。输送电流的蓄电器的能量达一百五十万焦耳。从外形看，这种装置很像一所发电站或者一座研究微粒子的加速器。
    在相邻的展览台上陈列着真空环圈的解剖模型，里面的一条银色的光带在不息地在真空中循环。这条光带就是等离子状态的氢原子的活动范围。这条光带内不断放电，氢原子不断碰来碰去，温度也不断提高。这条光带被看不见的墙壁，强大的电磁场所管束着，使里面的微粒子不致于跑掉，温度不致于散失。
    另外一种可能控制热核反应的装置，绝热捕集器，也可以在展览室中见到。有名的“奥格拉”装置就是根据绝热捕集器的原理建造的。工作人员告诉我们：如果说前面的两种装置可以比喻成茶炊，那么这种绝热捕集器型的热核反应装置就有点像“暖水瓶”。加速了的氢离子从加速器中注入捕集器，就像把热水倾入暖水瓶一样。捕集器的强大磁场不是由内部放电构成的，而是由外部的磁场线圈构成的。加速了的高热的氢离子在捕集器内两端“磁塞”间来回震动，不断互相冲撞，直到发生热核反应为止。
    展览室中的这些陈列品说明，把威胁着人类的氢弹这种爆炸式的热核反应，变成可以控制的热核反应是完全可能的。苏联学者们在这方面又走在世界各国的前面。
    在展览室的墙壁上挂着一巨幅海水奔腾的图画，这是告诉参观者们，未来这些陈列在这里的复杂装置的燃料就是毫不值钱的、用之不竭的海水。工作人员以兴奋的语句告诉我们：一公升普通的水内所含的能，等于四百公升汽油的能。一杯重水内所含的能大约等于几千吨煤炭所含的能。控制了热核能以后，人类就可以制造照明北极夜的人工太阳，就可以飞出太阳系。参观了原子能展览馆，我们相信，在苏联学者的努力下，这一天的到来是不会太远了。（附图片）
