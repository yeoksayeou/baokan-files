Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: People all over the world are increasingly concerned about the persecuted Greek patriots and their embodiment—the fate of Glykos. Angry protests and calls for the immediate release of patriots have spread from all over the world to the famous Greek city of Athens.

The Soviet Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee wrote to Greek Prime Minister Karamanlis, resolutely demanding freedom for Glykos, the glorious son of the Greek people, on behalf of millions of Soviet people.

Scientists from various countries working at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Moscow sent a telegram to the King of Greece on the 9th, hoping that he would use his influence to stop the persecution of Glykos and release this Greek national hero.

The entire people of the German Democratic Republic participated in the protest movement condemning the Greek reactionaries for plotting to harm Glykos. Tens of thousands of residents held protest rallies across the country. A large-scale mass protest rally will also be held in Berlin on the evening of the 10th. Working people in various places have also written letters and sent telegrams to the King of Greece, the Greek Prime Minister, and the leaders of the Greek Orthodox Church, demanding the release of Glykos.

The Polish people resolutely demand the release of Glykos. In recent days, mass rallies have been held by workers in factories and enterprises in Warsaw, in industrial cities such as Wrocław, Szczecin, and Krakow, and in many other places.

Hungarian working people, writers, artists, scientists, and actors have all sent telegrams to the Greek authorities, protesting the illegal trial of Glykos and demanding his release.

The people of Cyprus, who share blood ties with the Greek people, demonstrated in Nicosia, the capital of Cyprus, on the 9th to protest the trial of Glykos. The demonstrators shouted: "Fascists are shameless!" "(Greek) Karamanlis government is shameless!"

In Britain, twenty Labour members of Parliament, including Mrs. Barbara Castle, Arthur Lewis, and Julius Silverman, sent a telegram to the Greek Prime Minister, demanding that Glykos be handed over to an ordinary court for trial. The "Haldane Society," composed of British lawyers, telegraphed the Greek Prime Minister, saying: "British lawyers believe that it is unfair for a military court to try a civilian for an ordinary case in peacetime."

Members of the "Save Glykos" committee, formed in Britain a few weeks ago, began a twelve-hour vigil outside the Greek Embassy on the evening of the 9th, protesting the Greek authorities' handing Glykos over to a military court for trial. The committee decided to hold a mass protest rally in Hyde Park on the 11th, followed by a demonstration.

The French "International Committee for the Defense of Glykos" published a statement in "Liberation" on the 9th, sternly refuting the Greek government's slanderous claim that the worldwide movement to defend the Greek national hero was a lie allegedly orchestrated by "international communism."

The statement pointed out that in Greece itself, many political activists have protested against the decision to hand Glykos over to a military court for trial, and these political activists cannot necessarily be said to sympathize with the Communists, such as Tsaldaris, who once served as Prime Minister of Greece and led the task of suppressing the Communists during the civil war. The Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor sent a telegram to the Greek Prime Minister and the President of the Athens Military Court, demanding "the release of this Greek hero who resisted Hitler's aggressors."

The famous Italian lawyer Cesare Degli Occhi wrote to the Greek Ambassador to Rome, urging the Greek government to pay attention to the voices of the broad public in the world regarding the Glykos incident.

The Swedish Student Union "Clarté" sent representatives to the Greek Embassy in Stockholm to submit a petition, demanding that the Greek government hand over the Glykos case to a civil court for trial.

    一定要制止对格列索斯的迫害
    各国人民继续采取行动发出正义的呼声
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：全世界人民愈来愈关心着受迫害的希腊爱国者和他们的化身——格列索斯的命运。愤怒的抗议、立即释放爱国者的呼声，从世界各地传到希腊的名城——雅典。
    苏联亚非团结委员会写信给希腊首相卡拉曼利斯，代表千百万苏联人，坚决要求给予希腊人民光荣的儿子格列索斯以自由。
    在莫斯科联合原子核研究所工作的各国科学家9日打电报给希腊国王，希望他利用他的影响，制止对格列索斯的迫害，并释放这位希腊民族英雄。
    德意志民主共和国全体人民参加了谴责希腊反动派谋害格列索斯的抗议运动。全国各地有好几万居民举行了抗议大会。10日晚上，柏林还将举行一个大规模的群众抗议大会。各地劳动人民还写信和打电报给希腊国王、希腊首相和希腊正教教会的领袖，要求释放格列索斯。
    波兰人民坚决要求释放格列索斯。近几天来，在华沙的工厂和企业里、在弗罗茨瓦夫、什切青、克拉科夫等工业城市以及其他很多地方，职工们都举行了群众大会。
    匈牙利劳动人民、作家、艺术家、科学家和演员都纷纷打电报给希腊当局，抗议非法审讯格列索斯，并要求释放他。
    同希腊人民有血缘关系的塞浦路斯人民9日在塞浦路斯首府尼科西亚示威，抗议审讯格列索斯。示威群众高呼：“法西斯分子真可耻！”“（希腊）卡拉曼利斯政府真可耻！”
    在英国，巴巴拉·卡斯尔夫人、阿瑟·刘易斯、朱利叶斯·锡尔弗曼等二十个工党议员打电报给希腊首相，要求把格列索斯移交普通法庭审讯。由英国律师组成的“哈尔丹协会”打电报给希腊首相说：“英国律师们认为，军事法庭在和平时期为一桩普通案件审讯一个平民是不公道的。”
    几星期前在英国组成的“拯救格列索斯”委员会的人员9日晚上在希腊大使馆外边开始十二小时的守夜，抗议希腊当局把格列索斯交给军事法庭审理。这个委员会决定11日在海德公园举行群众抗议大会，会后还要游行示威。

    声明指出，在希腊本国，许多政治活动家纷纷抗议把格列索斯交给军事法庭审判的决定，而这些政治活动家未必能说是同情共产党人的，例如察耳达里斯，他曾经任希腊首相，在国内战争时期曾领导镇压共产党的任务。法国总工会执行局打电报给希腊首相和雅典军事法庭庭长，要求“释放这位抵抗希特勒侵略者的希腊英雄”。
    意大利著名律师凯萨雷·代格利·奥基写信给希腊驻罗马大使，提请希腊政府注意世界广大公众对格列索斯事件的呼声。
