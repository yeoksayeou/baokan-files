    Unity and Mutual Assistance, Passing on Technology:
    Baotou Steel Vigorously Trains Workers of All Ethnic Groups
    (Reported by this newspaper) The cradle of the first generation of modern industrial workers in Inner Mongolia – Baotou Iron and Steel Company – has more than 1,700 workers of Mongolian, Hui, Manchu, and Korean ethnic groups throughout the company. With the patient help of Han Chinese master workers, they are learning quickly while working. Many of these ethnic minority workers are transferred from the military, and some come from pastoral or rural areas. After a short period of internship and training, most of them are now able to operate independently.
    Heizi, a Mongolian apprentice in the processing and repair workshop of the ore dressing and sintering plant, began learning electric welding in September last year. The Han Chinese master worker taught him electric welding techniques hand-in-hand. Now he has learned relatively complex techniques such as flat welding, vertical welding, and overhead welding, and has also learned gas welding, reaching the level of a second-grade worker. Meng Guiying, an apprentice in the machine processing workshop of the ironmaking plant, is a Hui girl who came to Baotou Steel in July last year after graduating from elementary school. When she first entered the workshop, she was frightened by the wires everywhere. When the lathe started, she was terrified. The Han Chinese master worker enthusiastically told her about safety knowledge and the structure of the lathe, telling her not to be afraid. Later, he patiently taught her how to load materials, how to work on the lathe, how to thread screws, and so on. After more than half a year of study, she now understands a great deal of technical theory, such as the conversion of British and metric systems, the calculation of slope, polygons, lathes, change gears, and cutting speeds. In terms of practical operation, she has learned relatively complex techniques such as peeling rough parts, fastening basic screws, cutting screw washers, and repairing and manufacturing some parts, and she can also meet the quality requirements for these tasks.
    At the Bayan Obo mine, a group of Mongolian workers are operating modern production tools such as electric locomotives, drilling machines, and "Ural giants" (large electric shovels that can excavate four cubic meters of ore at a time), storing large quantities of ore for the production of Baotou Steel's No. 1 blast furnace. They only came to the mine more than half a year ago. At that time, they, like Heizi, could not even speak fluent Chinese, and their educational level was below senior primary school. They could not understand technical terms, and could not even take notes when the master workers lectured. The Han Chinese master workers took them to practice on the machines during the day, and went to their dormitories at night to help them draw diagrams and give detailed explanations. Once, Li Derun, a Han Chinese master worker, spent the whole night looking through reference books and searching for words that Jinshan, a Mongolian apprentice, could understand in order to help Jinshan understand the structure of the current control instrument. In winter, the top of the main mine is often covered with wind and snow, and the cold wind is biting. Liu Zongyu, the electric shovel driver, endured the severe cold and did not leave the main mine for the whole winter, teaching Zhao Rigetu, a Mongolian apprentice, how to operate hand-in-hand. Now Zhao Rigetu has officially taken the job as the electric shovel co-driver. Jin Deli, an old worker from Anshan, in order to train his Mongolian apprentice, Sejilah, into an electric shovel operator like himself as soon as possible, took Sejilah to his dormitory and used the evening time to teach Sejilah technology. After more than four months, Sejilah learned the technology that usually takes two or three years to master.

    团结互助　传授技术
    包钢大力培养各族工人
    本报讯　内蒙古第一代现代产业工人成长的摇篮——包头钢铁公司全公司一千七百多名蒙、回、满、朝鲜等各民族工人，在汉族老师傅耐心帮助下，边做边学，成长很快。这些少数民族工人有许多是从部队转业来的，有的是从牧区、农村来的，经过短时间的实习训练，现在他们大多数都能够独立操作。
    选矿烧结厂加工修理车间蒙古族徒工黑子，去年9月间开始学电焊，汉族老师傅就把着手教给他电焊技术，现在他已经学会了平焊、立焊、仰焊比较复杂的技术，还学会了汽焊，达到二级工水平。炼铁厂机械加工车间徒工、回族姑娘门桂英，去年7月在小学毕业后来到包钢。她刚一进车间，看见到处是电线，车床一开动，怕得不行，汉族老师傅就热情地给她讲安全知识，讲车床构造，告诉她不要怕，以后又耐心地教她如何上料，如何上床子工作，如何套缧丝等等。经过半年多时间的学习，现在她在技术理论上已懂得一大套，什么英、公制换算，斜度、多边形、车床、交换齿轮、切削速度等计算她都会。在实际操作方面，她学习了扒毛坯、扣基础缧丝、切缧丝垫圈、部分零件的修理和制造等比较复杂的技术，而且做这些活还能达到质量要求。
    在白云鄂博矿山上，有一批蒙古族工人正在操作着电气机车、穿孔机、“乌拉尔巨人”（一次可挖掘四立方公尺矿石的大电铲）等现代化生产工具，为包钢一号高炉生产储备着大量矿石。他们是半年多以前才到矿山的。那时候，他们也和黑子一样，连汉话也说不好，文化程度都不到高小，技术名词听不懂，老师傅讲课连笔记也记不上。汉族老师傅白天带他们到机器上实习，晚上就到他们宿舍去帮助绘图，进行详细的讲解。有一次，汉族老师傅李德润，为了帮助蒙古族徒工金山了解电流控制仪表的构造，翻阅参考书，寻找金山能够接受的字句，整整忙了一夜。冬天的主矿山顶，常常是风雪弥漫，寒风凛冽，电铲机司机刘宗禹忍受着严寒，整整一个冬天没有离开主矿，手把手地教给蒙古族徒工照日格图操作，现在照日格图已经正式担任了电铲副司机的工作。从鞍山来的老工人金德礼，为了尽快地把蒙古族徒弟色吉拉呼培养成和自己一样的电铲手，把色吉拉呼接到自己的宿舍里，利用晚上时间教给色吉拉呼技术，经过了四个多月时间，色吉拉呼就学到了过去通常需要二、三年才能掌握的技术。
