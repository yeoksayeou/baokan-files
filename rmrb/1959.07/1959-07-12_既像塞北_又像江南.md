　　Resembling Both the Northern Frontier and Southern China

　　In the past, people knew that Southern China was the land of fish and rice, and also the place where silk came from. Now, in Heilongjiang Province, the northernmost part of China, rice cultivation and fish farming are developing year by year, moving towards becoming a land of fish and rice, and the silk farming industry has also developed to the Heihe area, the northernmost part of China.

　　Soybeans

　　Heilongjiang planted 21,090,000 mu of soybeans this year, accounting for more than 21% of the province's total sown area. Most of the soybeans planted by farmers are "Man Cang Jin" (Full Granary Gold), which are large, round, and have a high oil content of 18% to 21%. Soybeans are not only a highly nutritious agricultural product, but also a widely used industrial raw material. In addition to being used for oil extraction and food, they can also be used to make more than 400 kinds of industrial products, such as plastics, artificial cream, paints, textile dyeing agents, artificial rubber, paper making, artificial wool, and other artificial fibers.

　　Silk

　　Compared to rice cultivation and fish farming, silkworm rearing is the newest undertaking in the rural areas of Heilongjiang Province. Large-scale trial rearing began last year, and more than 13 million silkworm cocoons were harvested last year, and the Mudanjiang Silk Factory wove the first piece of silk fabric in Heilongjiang Province. Heilongjiang Province has many wild tussah oak forests, about 3 to 4 million mu. The main type of silkworm being raised on a large scale is the tussah silkworm, with a small amount of mulberry silkworms and castor silkworms. According to the results of last year's trial rearing, the average weight of 1,000 cocoons was fourteen to fifteen jin. This year, Heilongjiang Province will continue to release tussah silkworms on a larger scale. Along with the development of the silkworm rearing industry, a new song has been widely spread in the rural areas of the province: "Golden coins are produced in the tussah oak forest, no need to grow cotton to wear silk; history has opened a new page, silk is not only produced in Southern China."

　　Rice

　　Heilongjiang rice is crystal clear and pliable, with the color, aroma, and taste of glutinous rice, and is as famous as the Tianjin Xiaozhan rice. This year, more than 4 million mu of rice have been sown in the province. From 1916, when rice cultivation began in Ning'an County, the southernmost part of Heilongjiang Province, to the liberation in 1945, the total area of paddy fields in the province only developed to 1.8 million mu in 30 years, and the rice growing line did not cross 47 degrees north latitude. After liberation, Party and government organs attached importance to rice development, designated staff to work with farmers to vigorously cultivate new early-maturing varieties, and the rice planting boundary gradually moved north. This year, rice has been planted all the way to the Heilongjiang River at 53 degrees north latitude. The short frost-free period and low water temperature were originally unfavorable conditions for the development of rice production in Heilongjiang Province. However, after years of hard work by farmers, more than ten new rice varieties suitable for the natural conditions of Heilongjiang Province have been successfully cultivated, and two varieties have a growth period of only 90 days. According to the research results of a professor at the Northeast Agricultural College, the total temperature required for the entire growth period of rice in Southern China is more than 3,000 degrees Celsius, while the rice varieties in Heilongjiang Province, which have changed their characteristics after artificial cultivation, only need more than 2,000 degrees to mature. Farmers in various places have also created various methods, such as sun-drying water for irrigation and using oiled paper for seedling cultivation, to increase the water temperature and shorten the growth period of rice in the fields.

　　Fish

　　The rivers and lakes across Heilongjiang are favorable conditions for the development of paddy fields and fish farming. There are more than 1,700 rivers in the province with a length of more than 10 kilometers, and aquatic resources are very rich. The Songhua River is rich in "Three Flowers (Mandarin Fish, Bream, and Chinese Ide) and Five Luo (Freshwater Fish)", and the Ussuri River and Heilongjiang River are most famous for salmon and sturgeon. And the "Lake Crucian" of Jingbo Lake is even more popular. In addition to casting nets, ice fishing is popular in winter. In the newly reclaimed Mishan reclamation area, people use tractors to pull large nets to fish in winter. Two tractors drive on both sides of a small river, and the fishing nets catch the fish under the ice, and one net has caught 5,600 jin of fat crucian carp. After the establishment of the People's Communes in August last year, by the end of the year, People's Communes in various places had caught a large number of small fish and put them into fish ponds. The five counties of Zhaoyuan, Hulan, Bin County, Acheng, and Fujin on both sides of the Songhua River have mostly raised fish in their villages. The total area of artificial fish ponds built in the province is 15 million square meters. Qiqihar City, which is close to the Nenjiang River, has entered the city in its fish farming industry.

　　Sugar Beets

　　Farmers in Heilongjiang Province have been growing sugar beets for 58 years. The province's sugar beet planting area and total output rank first in the country. In 1958, 2.2 million mu were sown, with an output of 3.2 million dan, an increase of ten times compared with the early days of the Northeast Liberation. The sugar content of sugar beets was only 12.8% in 1949, but it has increased to 18.01% in 1958 (tested). This year, the sugar beet planting area has increased by 50,000 mu compared to last year.

　　These sugar beets strongly support the sugar industry. At present, there are already six mechanized sugar factories in the province, producing granulated sugar, refined white sugar, brown sugar, cube sugar, and rock sugar. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, more than 400 earthen sugar factories were built in the province. Now, the province's sugar production accounts for more than 12% of the country's total, and sugar beet sugar production ranks first in the country. 70% of the sugar produced each year supports all parts of the country.

　　There are many uses for sugar beet by-products. For example, waste molasses can be used to make alcohol. There are 12,000 tons of waste sugar beet shreds every day, which are sold at home and abroad after mechanical drying. The green tops, stems, and leaves of sugar beets can also be used to feed livestock.

### 既像塞北  又像江南

    既像塞北  又像江南
    过去人们知道鱼米之乡是江南，出蚕丝的地方也是江南。现在在我国最北部的黑龙江省也一年年发展水稻，一年年发展养鱼，向鱼米之乡发展，养蚕事业也发展到我国最北部的黑河地区。
    大豆
    黑龙江今年播种大豆二千一百零九万亩，占全省总播种面积的21％强。农民所种植的大豆大部分是“满仓金”，这种大豆，个儿大，粒子圆，含油率高达18％到21％。大豆不仅是一种营养价值很高的农产品，又是用途很广的工业原料，除了用来榨油、食用外，还可以做四百多种工业品，像塑料、人造奶油、油漆、纺织染料剂、人造橡胶、造纸、人造羊毛和其他人造纤维等。
    蚕丝
    比起种水稻、养鱼，养蚕是黑龙江省农村最年轻的事业。较大规模的试养是从去年开始的，去年收了一千三百多万颗蚕茧，由牡丹江丝绸厂织出了黑龙江省的第一匹绸缎。黑龙江省野生的柞树林很多，约有三百万到四百万亩。开始大规模饲养的主要是柞蚕，也有少量的桑蚕和蓖麻蚕。去年试养的结果，蚕茧的千粒重平均为十四五斤。今年黑龙江省将更大规模地继续放养柞蚕。和养蚕业发展同时，一首新歌在全省农村广为流传：“柞树林里结金钱，不种棉花穿丝绢；历史从此开新页，丝绢不只产江南”。
                      （宋化江）
    水稻
    黑龙江大米晶莹柔韧，具有糯米的色香味，和著名的天津小站米齐名。今年全省水稻已播种了四百多万亩，而从1916年黑龙江省最南部的宁安县开始种植水稻到1945年解放，三十年间全省水田总面积只发展到一百八十万亩，而且水稻生长线没有越过北纬四十七度。解放后党政机关重视水稻发展，指定工作人员和农民一起大力培育早熟新品种，水稻种植疆界逐步北移，今年水稻一直种到北纬五十三度的黑龙江边。无霜期短，水温较低，本来是黑龙江省发展水稻生产的不利条件。但是经过农民多年努力，十多个适合黑龙江省自然条件的水稻新品种已经培育成功，有两个品种的生育期只要九十几天。根据东北农学院一位教授的研究结果，江南水稻整个生育期需要的温度总量是摄氏三千多度，经人工培育后变了性格的黑龙江省的水稻品种，只要两千多度就成熟了。各地农民也创造了多种办法，例如晒水灌溉、油纸育苗，提高水的温度，缩短水稻田间的生育期。
        鱼
    纵横黑龙江各地的江河湖泊是发展水田和养鱼事业的有利条件。全省长度在十公里以上的河流共有一千七百多条，水产资源非常丰富。松花江盛产“三花（鳌花、扁花、吉花）五罗（法罗、雅罗、同罗、哲罗、湖罗）”，乌苏里江、黑龙江以大马哈鱼、锽鱼最有名。而镜泊湖的“湖鲫”，更是脍炙人口。捕鱼方法除撒网外，盛行冬季冰上捕鱼。在开垦不久的密山垦区，人们冬季使用拖拉机拉着大网捕鱼，两台拖拉机在一条小河两岸上开动，鱼网在冰下拦河兜捕，一网就打到过五千六百斤肥大的鲫鱼。去年8月人民公社成立后到年底，各地人民公社从江河捕捞了大量尾鱼苗放入鱼塘。松花江两岸的肇源、呼兰、宾县、阿城、富锦五县已大部分乡养鱼。全省人工修造的养鱼池，面积共有一千五百万平方米。靠近嫩江的齐齐哈尔市，养鱼事业进入了城市。
    甜菜
    黑龙江省农民种植甜菜，已经有五十八年的历史了。全省的甜菜种植面积和总产量均占全国的首位。1958年播种了二百二十万亩，产量达三百二十万担，比东北解放初期增加十倍。甜菜的含糖量1949年仅为12.8％，到1958年已提高18.01％（化验数）。今年甜菜播种面积比去年增加了五万亩。
    这些甜菜有力支援了制糖工业。目前全省已有机械化糖厂六处，生产砂糖、粉白糖、红糖、方糖和冰糖。1958年大跃进中，全省又兴建了四百多处土糖厂。现在全省出产的糖占全国12％以上，甜菜制糖已占全国的首位。每年生产的糖，70％支援全国各地。
    甜菜的副产品还有很多用处，像废糖蜜可以制酒精，每天有一万二千吨废甜菜丝，经过机械干燥后行销国内外。甜菜的青顶、茎叶，还可以用来饲养牲畜。
