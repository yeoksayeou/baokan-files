Xinhua News Agency, 26th: In the first six months of this year, major industrial areas across the country have added a significant number of new power generation units. In the Northeast, the Fuxin and Jilin power plants have installed three generator units with a capacity of 50,000 kilowatts each this year. At the Harbin Thermal Power Plant, two steam turbine generator sets with a capacity of 25,000 kilowatts each have also begun operating. In the Shanghai area, seven large and medium-sized steam turbine generators at the Wangting, Nanshi, and Minhang power plants have recently been officially put into production. Due to the completion of the first phase of the Beijing Thermal Power Plant, the power supply to the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan power grid has greatly increased. In addition, power generation units ranging from 6,000 to 12,000 kilowatts have been put into operation this year in Handan, Qingdao, Xinxiang, Chongqing, Guiyang, Nanning, and other places, effectively supporting local industrial production.

In line with the newly added power generation equipment mentioned above, various regions have also completed approximately 1,100 kilometers of high-voltage transmission lines of 110,000 volts or more in the first half of the year.

Currently, dozens of large power stations across the country are under intense construction. In order to accelerate the construction and installation of these projects and strive to put more power stations into production in the next five months, the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power recently organized several working groups to go to various regions to inspect the quality of the projects and arrange work for the second half of the year. The workers at various construction sites are also enthusiastically carrying out socialist labor competitions for high quality and high output. The construction progress of many major power stations has been greatly accelerated. The builders of Sanmenxia have been racing against the flood season to ensure that the water conservancy hub project plays a role in partially flood control this year and to strive for early power generation. At present, the main structure of the concrete dam has been poured to over 310 meters. At the Liaoning Power Station within the Northeast power grid, three sets of units are being installed simultaneously. The Wujing and Tiexi thermal power plants, which began construction in Shenyang and Shanghai respectively in the second half of last year, have already entered or are about to enter the equipment installation stage and are expected to be put into production soon.

    重要工业地区新增一批发电设备
    几十个大电站紧张施工
    新华社26日讯　全国重要工业地区今年前六个多月中都增加了不少新的发电设备。东北的阜新、吉林两电站，今年已安装好了三台容量达五万瓩的发电机组，哈尔滨火力发电厂也有两台容量为二万五千瓩的汽轮发电设备开始运转。在上海地区，望亭、南市和闵行电站有七台大中型汽轮发电机在最近正式投入生产。京津唐电网由于北京热电站第一期工程的建成，供电量已经大大增加。此外，在邯郸、青岛、新乡、重庆、贵阳、南宁等地，今年也都有六千到一万二千瓩的发电设备分别投入运行，有力地支援了当地的工业生产。
    同上述新增添的发电设备相适应，各地在上半年还建成了约一千一百公里长的十一万伏以上的高压送电线路。
    目前，全国还有几十个大型电站正在加紧施工建设。为了加快这些工程的建筑安装速度，争取今后五个月内有更多的电站投入生产，水利电力部在不久前组织几个工作组，分赴各地检查工程质量和安排下半年的工作。各工地的职工也正在热烈开展优质高产的社会主义劳动竞赛。许多主要电站的施工进度已经大大加快。三门峡的建设者们为了让水利枢纽工程在今年汛期起到部分拦洪的作用和争取提早发电，一直在同洪水赛跑。目前，混凝土大坝的部分主体工程已浇捣到三百一十米以上。东北电网内的辽宁电站，有三套机组正在同时安装。去年下半年在沈阳、上海分别动工新建的吴泾和铁西两个热电站，已经或即将进入设备安装阶段，预计不久就能投入生产。
