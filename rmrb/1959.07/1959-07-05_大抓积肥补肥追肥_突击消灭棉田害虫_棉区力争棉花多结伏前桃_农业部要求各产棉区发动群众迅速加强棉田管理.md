Xinhua News Agency, 4th. Farmers in key cotton-producing areas are actively carrying out a movement to strengthen cotton field management centered on accumulating fertilizer, supplementing fertilizer, and topdressing, striving for more pre-summer bolls.

At present, cotton seedlings have entered a period of vigorous growth and development. In key cotton-producing prefectures and counties of Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Shaanxi provinces in the Yellow River basin, cotton plants are already about one chi (Chinese foot, approximately 1/3 meter) tall, with six to seven fruiting branches and twelve to fourteen buds. In high-yield plots, cotton has begun to flower and set bolls. In the cotton areas of the Yangtze River basin, single-crop cotton fields have six or more fruiting branches, eleven to twelve flower buds, and are about to flower. In Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, the 100,000 mu (approximately 6667 hectares) of transplanted cotton had generally begun to flower by mid-June; double-crop cotton fields, which were planted later, also began to bud successively in mid- to late June.

Many key cotton-producing provinces, prefectures, and counties have successively held on-site meetings or telephone conferences to implement the spirit of the "National Cotton Boll Protection Conference" convened by the Ministry of Agriculture, and have further arranged measures to mobilize the masses to launch a management movement to protect cotton buds and bolls, and strive for more pre-summer bolls. With the development and deepening of the movement, key cotton-producing areas, in response to the characteristics of this year's general cotton fields having less base fertilizer and the early occurrence of insect pests, have carried out the strengthening of cotton field management work centered on accumulating fertilizer, supplementing fertilizer, and topdressing. During the summer harvest period, Lintong County, Shaanxi Province, arranged for 15% of its labor force to continuously manage cotton fields. Lingbao County, Henan Province, convened a meeting of commune party secretaries as soon as the summer harvest was basically completed, and decided to transfer 70% of the labor force to cotton fields for concentrated management work. In Shehong County, Sichuan Province, 160,000 mu of cotton fields have had 100,000 laborers invested in cotton field management every day from late May to now. In order to ensure that cotton fields are well-fed, many areas have vigorously accumulated fertilizer and created fertilizer, rationally arranged fertilizers for grain fields and cotton fields, and implemented the policy of using chemical fertilizers mainly for cotton fields and other important economic crops. Some areas have also actively increased the allocation of cake fertilizer for topdressing cotton fields. The North Zhangzhuang Production Team of Douhu Town Commune in Liaocheng City, Shandong Province, improved the enthusiasm of its members for accumulating fertilizer for cotton fields through accounting. The entire team organized 250 people to specialize in accumulating fertilizer. In addition to supplementing fertilizer on the more than 900 mu of cotton fields that had not been fertilized with base fertilizer, they also accumulated more than 2.9 million jin (approximately 1450 tons) of fertilizer, preparing to apply another 20 dan (approximately 1000 kg) of topdressing fertilizer per mu of cotton field. Hubei, Jiangxi and other provinces, on the one hand, organized the masses to use summer harvest crop stalks to compost fertilizer, and on the other hand, processed rapeseed in advance to provide oil cake for cotton field topdressing. Siyang County, Jiangsu Province, actively planned to "return cotton cake to the fields," and has already transferred back more than 1 million jin of cotton cake for distribution to cotton fields for topdressing. In the more than 4 million mu of cotton fields in the Yubei cotton area of ​​Henan Province, weeding and soil loosening has been carried out three times, of which 60% of the cotton fields have been weeded and loosened four times, and more than 30% of the cotton fields have been weeded and loosened five times; more than 1.5 million mu have been topdressed; and now 30% of the labor force is being drawn to concentrate on pest control; more than 20% of the cotton fields have met the requirements of no insects, no weeds, no hardened soil, no yellow and weak seedlings, no drought or flood, and no superfluous buds and crazy branches.

However, the progress of cotton management work is currently not balanced enough. Large-area high-yield cotton fields are better managed, with uniform development and good growth; while the topdressing progress of general cotton fields is slow, and weeding, pest control and other tasks have not kept up in time. There are still a considerable number of cotton fields that have not been fertilized with base fertilizer, and the cotton plants are yellow and weak, and their growth is slow. It is necessary to quickly supplement fertilizer and topdressing, and at the same time, step up pest control and weeding to promote early boll setting and more boll setting, and ensure a comprehensive increase in cotton production.

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The Ministry of Agriculture issued a notice on the 3rd, requiring cotton-producing areas to quickly launch a movement to strengthen cotton field management centered on accumulating fertilizer, supplementing fertilizer, and topdressing.

The notice said that most cotton areas currently have good cotton growth, and the general budding period is earlier than last year. However, due to insufficient base fertilizer, the progress of topdressing is also very slow. Many cotton fields are lacking fertilizer, and cotton seedlings are growing thin. Now is the period for cotton budding and flowering. Whether the application of fertilizer to cotton fields can keep up in time is a key measure to strive for early boll setting, more boll setting, and ensure increased production. Therefore, it is required that cotton areas at all levels seize the opportunity, fully mobilize the masses, and vigorously launch a movement to strengthen cotton field management centered on accumulating fertilizer, supplementing fertilizer, and topdressing.

The notice pointed out that there is currently a lot of green grass, a lot of straw, high temperatures, and rapid rotting. Grasping the composting and fertilizer production, raising pigs to accumulate fertilizer, and accumulating human manure are all good fertilizers for cotton field topdressing. Rotten farm manure and soil with fertilizer effect are also good. We should vigorously tap all usable sources of fertilizer. Hubei Province's method of composting rapeseed and broad bean stalks into cotton field fertilizer and processing rapeseed in advance to allocate some oil cake for cotton field topdressing is very good. When using chemical fertilizers, all localities must earnestly implement the policy of focusing chemical fertilizers on cotton fields and other important economic crops. Supplementing and topdressing before summer is the most important. Not only should high-yield cotton fields be fully topdressed, but general cotton fields must also be topdressed quickly. For cotton fields with severe fertilizer deficiency, fertilizer should be supplemented as soon as possible. It is necessary to focus on accumulating and producing fertilizer to prepare fertilizer for topdressing during the summer boll period and topdressing during the autumn boll period, so that the level of fertilizer application in cotton fields this year will not be lower than last year.

The notice said that aphid damage has not yet shown a downward trend, and the leaf curling rate in severely damaged cotton fields has reached 50% to 60%. The occurrence of bollworms and other bud and boll period pests is also earlier than last year, and the occurrence area is also very common, which is a great threat to cotton production. All localities should immediately mobilize the masses to carry out pest control campaigns in an organized and planned manner according to the pest situation. Regarding the use of pesticides, it is necessary to save on medicine, and also to grasp the favorable timing of medicine application and concentrate on eliminating pests. While focusing on supplementing fertilizer, topdressing, and pest control in cotton fields, we must strengthen management measures such as weeding and soil loosening, irrigation, and pruning in cotton fields.

    大抓积肥补肥追肥　突击消灭棉田害虫
    棉区力争棉花多结伏前桃
    农业部要求各产棉区发动群众迅速加强棉田管理
    新华社4日讯　各地重点产棉区农民正在积极开展以积肥、补肥、追肥为中心加强棉花田间管理运动，力争棉花多结伏前桃。
      目前棉苗已进入生长发育盛期。黄河流域河北、河南、山东、陕西等省的重点产棉专区和县，棉株已高一尺左右，有果枝六个到七个，现蕾十二个到十四个，丰产方的棉花已开花结铃。长江流域棉区一熟棉田的棉花，已有果枝六个以上，有花蕾十一个到十二个，即将开花。四川省简阳县十万亩移栽的棉花，在6月中旬就已普遍开花；两熟棉田的棉花生育稍迟，也已在6月中下旬先后现蕾。
    许多重点产棉省、专区、县，都先后召开了现场会议或电话会议，贯彻农业部召开的“全国棉花保桃会议”的精神，并进一步安排措施，发动群众掀起棉花保蕾保桃，争取多结伏前桃的管理运动。随着运动的开展和深入，重点棉区针对今年一般棉田底肥少、虫害发生得早等特点，开展了以积肥、补肥、追肥为中心的加强棉田管理工作。陕西省临潼县在夏收期间，安排了15％的劳力不间断地管理棉田。河南省灵宝县在夏收基本结束时，就召开了公社党委书记会议，确定抽调70％的劳动力投入棉田突击管理工作。四川省射洪县十六万亩棉田，从5月下旬到现在，每天投入棉花田间管理的劳力达十万人。为了使棉田吃饱喝足，不少地区大搞积肥、造肥，合理安排粮田、棉田的肥料，并且贯彻化肥主要用于棉田和其他重要经济作物的方针，有的还积极增调饼肥给棉田追肥。山东省聊城市斗虎镇公社北张庄生产队，通过算帐，提高了社员为棉田积肥的积极性，全队组织了二百五十人专门积肥，除了在未施底肥的九百多亩棉田上补施肥料以外，还积了二百九十多万斤肥料，准备每亩棉田再施追肥二十担。湖北、江西等省，一方面组织群众利用夏收作物藁秆沤肥造肥，一方面提前加工油菜籽，以油饼供棉田作追肥。江苏省泗阳县积极筹划“棉饼返田”，已调回棉饼一百多万斤，分配给棉田追肥。河南省豫北棉区的四百多万亩棉田，已普遍中耕过三次，其中有60％的棉田已中耕过四次，30％以上的棉田中耕过五次；有一百五十多万亩已施过追肥；现在正抽出30％的劳力突击治虫；已有20％以上的棉田达到无虫、无草荒板结、无黄弱苗、无旱涝、无赘芽疯杈等的要求。
    但是，目前棉花管理工作进度还不够平衡，大面积丰产棉田管理得较好，发育整齐，生长良好；而一般棉田的追肥进度迟慢，中耕、治虫等工作未及时跟上，还有相当一部分未施底肥的棉田，棉株已呈现黄弱，生长迟缓，需要迅速补肥、追肥，同时要加紧治虫、中耕，以促进棉花早座桃多座桃，确保棉花全面增产。
    新华社3日讯　农业部3日发出通知，要求产棉地区迅速开展以积肥补肥追肥为中心的加强棉花田间管理运动。
    通知说，目前大部分棉区棉花生长良好，一般现蕾期都比去年早。但是，由于底肥不足，追肥进度也很缓慢。不少棉田因缺肥，棉苗生长瘦弱。现在已进入棉花结蕾开花时期，棉田施肥能否及时跟上，正是争取棉花早结桃，多结桃，确保增产的关键措施。因此，要求各地棉区抓紧时机，充分发动群众，大力开展一个以积肥补肥追肥为中心的加强棉田管理运动。
    通知指出，当前青草多、藁秆多、气温高、腐熟快，抓紧沤肥造肥，养猪积肥，大积人粪尿；腐熟厩肥以及有肥效的炕土等，都是棉田追肥的好肥料。应该大力挖掘一切可以利用的肥源。湖北省把油菜、蚕豆的藁秆沤做棉田肥料，把油菜籽提前加工拨一部分油饼做棉田追肥的办法很好。各地在使用化肥时，必须切实贯彻化肥重点用于棉田和其他重要经济作物的方针。伏前的补肥追肥工作最重要，不仅对大面积丰产棉田要施足追肥，对一般棉田也必须抓紧追肥。对于脱肥严重的棉田，应当及早补肥。要抓紧积肥造肥工作，为伏桃期追肥和秋桃期追肥准备肥料，做到今年棉田施肥水平不低于去年。
    通知说，目前蚜虫为害尚无下降趋势，为害严重的棉田卷叶率竟达百分之五、六十。棉铃虫等蕾铃期害虫的发生也比去年早，发生地区也很普遍，这对棉花丰产是个很大威胁。各地应当根据虫情，立即发动群众有组织有计划地开展治虫战役。对农药的使用，既要节约用药，又须掌握用药有利时机，突击消灭虫害。在抓紧棉田补肥追肥、治虫工作的同时，必须加强棉田的中耕、灌溉、整枝等管理措施。（附图片）
