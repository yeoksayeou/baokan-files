Xinhua News Agency, Harbin: Jixi Coal Mine, based on consolidating and improving small coal mines, is accelerating the equipping of a number of small mines with development prospects. After these small mines are transformed, they can produce 880,000 tons of coal in the second half of this year.

During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the vast number of workers at Jixi Coal Mine opened up a large number of small coal mines using indigenous methods, extracting more than one million tons of coal. In the first half of this year, Jixi Coal Mine organized technical personnel in geology, coal mining, and mine construction to further study the situation of these mines, and decided to select thirty-eight pairs of small mines with development prospects to equip them with mining, transportation, and other mechanical equipment in batches.

In order to accelerate the equipping of these mines, Jixi Coal Mine, in addition to deciding to use all twenty-nine winches, pumps and other mining equipment allocated by the Provincial Fuel Industry Department to equip these mines, will also organize the mine's entire repair plant to rush-produce more than 2,000 coal mine cars for these mines. The ground transportation lines for these mines are also being accelerated.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang: Zhongling Coal Mine in Jinxian County, Jiangxi Province, has achieved remarkable results in transforming small coal mines using indigenous methods. The average daily output of the transformed small coal mines has increased more than fourfold compared to the past without increasing the labor force, and they can produce all year round.

Zhongling Coal Mine first took measures to improve the ventilation, drainage, hoisting, and transportation conditions of the mine, and then developed the recovery working face, changing the face of the small coal mine in two months.

The transformed small coal mines have eliminated the winch for hoisting and replaced it with a pulley; wooden skips are also used for loading coal, which has more than doubled efficiency. In terms of transportation, dump trucks are used to push coal, which not only improves efficiency but also reduces the labor intensity of workers. The ventilation conditions after the transformation have also been greatly improved, with each person receiving 4.4 cubic meters of fresh air per minute, completely eliminating the threat of gas. Before the transformation, wooden buckets were used for mine drainage, and each bucket could only lift 45 kilograms of water. Now, after using skips, 405 kilograms can be lifted at a time. With the above changes, the average daily output of this mine has increased from 12 tons in the past to 64 tons, ensuring normal and safe production.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 24th: Wuhu Prefecture in Anhui Province is concentrating its efforts on transforming a number of small coal mines, while accelerating the construction of a number of small mines using modern methods of production, in order to guarantee the completion of the coal production tasks for the second half of the year and to prepare for production next year.

The small coal mines being transformed have stable coal seams, good geology, abundant resources, convenient transportation, proximity to power sources, and relatively regular tunnel development. According to the established transformation plan, mechanical methods will be used for ventilation, drainage, and part of the hoisting work in these small coal mines.

There are a total of fifteen pairs of small mines using modern methods of production currently under construction, five pairs of which are striving to be completed this year and put into production by the end of the year. Their designed annual production capacity is 500,000 tons.

### 改造小煤窑　装备小煤窑  鸡西拨出设备装备小煤窑　钟陵经过改造产量提高四倍

    改造小煤窑　装备小煤窑
    鸡西拨出设备装备小煤窑　钟陵经过改造产量提高四倍
    据新华社哈尔滨讯　鸡西煤矿在整顿提高小煤窑的基础上，正加速装备一批有发展前途的小矿井。这些小矿井经过改造以后，今年下半年就可以生产出八十八万吨煤。
    鸡西煤矿广大职工在1958年生产大跃进中，曾经以土办法开拓了大批小煤窑，采出了一百多万吨煤炭。今年上半年，鸡西煤矿组织了地质、采煤和矿井建设等方面的技术力量，进一步研究这些矿井的情况，决定从中选出三十八对有发展前途的小矿井，分批装备采煤、运输等机械设备。
    鸡西煤矿为了加速装备这批矿井，鸡西煤矿除了决定将省燃料工业厅拨给的二十九台绞车、水泵等矿井设备，全部用来装备这些矿井外，还将组织全矿检修厂为这批矿井赶制二千多台运煤矿车。这批矿井的地面运输线路，也正在加速修建中。
    据新华社南昌讯　江西省进贤县钟陵煤矿用土法改造小煤井取得了显著效果。经过改造的小煤井在不增加劳动力的条件下，平均日产量比过去提高了四倍多，而且可以长年生产。
    钟陵煤矿首先采取措施改善了矿井的通风、排水、提升、运输状况，接着又开拓了回采工作面，经过两个月的时间改变了小煤井的面貌。
    经过改造的小煤井，在提升方面已经取消了辘轳，换上了天轮；装煤也采用了木质箕斗，效率比过去提高了一倍多。在运输方面，改用翻斗车推煤，不但提高了效率，而且也减轻了工人的劳动强度。改造后的通风条件也大大改善了，每人每分钟可以得到四点四立方米的新鲜风量，彻底消灭了瓦斯的威胁。改造前，矿井排水用木桶，每桶只能提水四十五公斤，现在改用箕斗后一次就提四百零五公斤。有了以上的改变，现在，这个矿的平均日产量已由过去的十二吨提高到六十四吨，并且保证了正常和安全生产。
    新华社合肥24日电　安徽芜湖专区正在集中力量改造一批小煤窑，同时加快建设一批采用洋法生产的小型矿井，以保证完成下半年煤炭生产任务，并且为明年生产做好准备。
    改造中的一批小煤窑，煤层稳定，地质较好，资源较富，交通方便，靠近电源，井巷开拓比较正规。按照已确定的改造计划，这批小煤窑的通风、排水和部分提升工作，都将采用机械。
    正在建设的一批用洋法生产的小型矿井共有十五对，其中的五对争取今年建成，年底交付生产，它们的设计年产能力为五十万吨。
