Flexibly Applying Zhang Qiuxiang's Cotton Planting Experience
Large Areas of Cotton in Shaanxi Grow Well, Flowering and Boll Setting Generally Occur Earlier

(Our newspaper, Xi'an, 30th dispatch) Over four million six hundred and thirty thousand mu of cotton in Shaanxi Province are generally growing well. Experienced cotton farmers reflect that this year, cotton budding, flowering, and boll formation are generally five or six days earlier than in previous years, which is a result of promoting Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton planting experience.

Shaanxi Province has widely promoted Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton planting experience. Various regions have cultivated over one million mu of "Qiuxiang Cotton Fields," with approximately one million five hundred thousand women participating in "Qiuxiang Cotton Field" crop teams (or squads). This year, cotton farmers in various regions are promoting Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton planting experience differently than in the past. Previously, they mostly learned from Zhang Qiuxiang how many times to fertilize, how many times to water, how many times to cultivate, as well as methods for topdressing, irrigating, and "five-step pruning." This year, cotton farmers in various regions have paid attention to flexibly applying Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton planting experience based on different soil, climate, variety, and crop conditions (irrigation, fertilization amounts, and labor, etc.).

In the western Guanzhong area, including Xi'an, Xianyang, and Xingping, the soil temperature is low, affecting the development of cotton seedlings, and the timing of cotton budding, flowering, and boll setting is generally six or seven days later than in eastern Guanzhong. In the past, although Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton planting experience was promoted, it was not applied well, and the results were not significant. This year, the women's team led by Liu Yukun and Zhang Chonglan of the Jiangwudian Production Team in Hancheng Commune, Xi'an City, flexibly applied Zhang Qiuxiang's experience on 180 mu of cotton fields, enabling cotton fields in this area to bud, flower, and set bolls earlier for the first time, and laying a good foundation for setting more autumn bolls and protecting bolls. The essence of Zhang Qiuxiang's experience is maintaining appropriate soil temperature and creating an environment with a moderate temperature for cotton seedling development. However, Zhang Qiuxiang's managed cotton fields are sandy soil, located in eastern Guanzhong, where the soil temperature is three or four degrees higher than in the west; while the cotton fields in the Xi'an area are mostly clay soil, with a soil temperature two or three degrees lower. Especially this year, with more rainy days in May, the soil temperature was lower than in previous years, further affecting seedling development. Therefore, they formulated their own management measures based on local soil temperature conditions. The specific methods are: increasing the number of cultivations, advancing soil hilling, and applying more old wall soil to increase soil temperature in various ways. Before budding, the cotton fields were hoed six or seven times, with some hoed up to thirteen times, ensuring that the soil was cultivated and loosened after excessive weed growth, rainfall, and irrigation; the soil hilling work at the roots was also advanced by seven or eight days compared to previous years, and irrigation frequency was appropriately reduced and more old wall soil was applied when not affected by drought. After implementing these measures, the previously unevenly growing cotton seedlings became robust and uniform. According to current observations, there are an average of over four thousand seedlings per mu in the 180-plus mu of cotton fields, with a plant height of about two chi (approximately 67 cm), each plant has seventeen or eighteen fruiting branches, and each plant has twenty-five to thirty flower buds; the most have twenty-five fruiting branches and over fifty flower buds. However, since entering July, the climate in the Xi'an area has been extremely hot, generally around 38 degrees Celsius, with a maximum of 42 degrees Celsius, and there has been no rain for a long time, cotton fields are showing signs of drought. Therefore, they decided to immediately flood irrigate once with fresh water, followed by two cultivations, and promptly prune to prevent excessive growth, in order to increase autumn bolls and reduce boll shedding.

Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton planting experience is being promoted in large areas of cotton fields. Cotton farmers in Xianyang City, grasping the key to Zhang Qiuxiang's cotton planting experience, are also combining it with local cotton planting experience, focusing on vigorously increasing autumn bolls, and formulating cotton field management measures. Over 90% of the cotton fields here are planted with "517" cotton, which is different from the "Dai Zi No. 15" cotton planted by Zhang Qiuxiang. Dai Zi cotton has a long growth period, with a high budding and boll setting rate in the later stage, while "517" cotton has a short growth period, and the timing of budding, flowering, and boll setting is concentrated in the autumn season. At the same time, cotton needs a large amount of fertilizer and water during this period (accounting for more than 60% of the total fertilizer and water required during the entire cotton growth process). Therefore, ensuring that more bolls and larger bolls are set in the autumn season is the key to the bumper harvest of 160,000 mu of cotton fields in Xianyang City. In the past, due to insufficient understanding of these characteristics, cotton field management measures could not keep up, and the yield of large field cotton could not be improved. This year, cotton farmers in the city have paid widespread attention to these issues and have taken measures to add fertilizer and water to cotton fields in an effort to set more bolls. For example, Diantai Commune has strengthened cotton field management in two aspects: First, apply a top dressing (at least 5,000 jin of manure per mu) and irrigate once; second, promptly carry out removing buds and cutting off tips in the "five-step pruning" (trousers legs were removed before budding, and cotton fields this year are wide and narrow rows for good ventilation and light, so old leaves are not removed), reducing the consumption of fertilizer and water, improving ventilation and light conditions, increasing the number of bolls, and setting more large bolls. In addition to having dedicated personnel responsible for pruning, irrigation, and cultivation, each production team has organized fertilizer accumulation teams to launch a fertilizer accumulation campaign to ensure the fertilizer needs of the cotton fields.

### 灵活运用张秋香植棉经验  陕西大片棉花生长良好　开花座桃普遍提早

    灵活运用张秋香植棉经验
    陕西大片棉花生长良好　开花座桃普遍提早
    本报西安30日电　陕西省四百六十三万多亩棉花普遍生长良好。有经验的棉农反映，今年棉花现蕾、开花、结桃，一般都比往年提早了五、六天，这是推广张秋香植棉经验的结果。
    陕西省普遍推广了张秋香的植棉经验，各地培育的“秋香棉田”就有一百多万亩，约有一百五十万妇女参加了“秋香棉田”作物组
  （队）。今年各地棉农推广张秋香植棉经验与往年有很大的不同。往年多是学张秋香施几次肥，浇几次水，中耕几次以及追肥、灌溉和“五步整枝”的方法；今年各地棉农都注意到根据不同的土壤、气候、品种和作物条件（灌溉、施肥量和人力等），灵活地运用张秋香的植棉经验。
    关中西部地区西安、咸阳、兴平等地，地温低，影响棉花幼苗的发育，棉花现蕾、开花和座桃的时间一般比关中东部晚六、七天。往年虽然也推广张秋香的植棉经验，但是运用不好，收效不大。今年，西安市汉城公社讲武殿生产队刘玉坤、张崇兰领导的妇女队，在一百八十亩棉田上，灵活地运用张秋香的经验，使这一带的棉田第一次提前现蕾、开花和座桃，并为多座伏桃、保桃打好基础。张秋香的经验的精髓是保持适当的地温，给棉苗发育创造一个温度适中的环境。但是，张秋香管理的棉田是沙性土壤，处在关中东部，地温比西部高三、四度；而西安地区的棉田多是粘性土壤，地温低二、三度。尤其是今年5月阴雨多，地温比往年低，就更加影响幼苗的发育。因此，她们根据当地的地温条件，制定了自己的管理措施。具体作法是：增加中耕次数，提前培土和多施陈墙土，从多方面来提高地温。在现蕾前，把棉田锄了六七遍，最多的锄了十三遍，做到了草多、雨后和灌溉后都中耕松土；根部培土工作也比往年提前七、八天，并在不受旱的情况下适当地减少了灌溉次数和增施陈墙土。贯彻这些措施后，使原来生长参差不齐的棉苗，一变为又茁壮又整齐。根据目前观察，一百八十多亩棉田平均每亩有四千多株苗，株高二尺左右，每株有十七、八个果枝，每株有二十五到三十个花蕾；最多的有二十五个果枝，有五十多个花蕾。但是，进入7月以后，西安地区气候酷热，一般在摄氏三十八度左右，最高到四十二度，而且很长时间没有落雨，棉田已露旱象。因此，她们决定立即漫灌一次活水，随着要中耕两次，抓紧整枝，防止疯长，以增加伏桃，减少落蕾落铃。
    张秋香的植棉经验在大面积棉田里推广。咸阳市的棉农，抓住张秋香植棉经验中的关键，也正结合当地的植棉经验，围绕着大抓伏桃，制定出棉田管理的措施。这里90％以上的棉田种的是“五一七”棉花，这种棉花和张秋香种的“岱字十五号”不同。岱字棉生长期长，后期现蕾、座桃率高，“五一七号”棉花生长期短，现蕾、开花和座桃的时间集中在伏期。同时，这一时期棉花需要大量的肥料和水（约占棉花生长过程全部需肥需水量的60％以上）。因此，保证伏期多结桃、结大桃是咸阳市十六万亩棉田丰收的关键。往年，由于对这些特点掌握不够，棉田管理措施跟不上，大田棉花产量不能提高。今年，该市棉农对这些问题已经引起普遍注意，并采取措施给棉田加肥加水，争取多座桃。如钓台公社从两方面加强棉田管理：首先是施一次追肥（每亩最少五千斤圈肥），浇一次水；其次是抓紧“五步整枝”中的去芽子、打辟尖等（现蕾前已脱裤腿，今年棉田都是宽窄行，通风透光好，不打老叶），减少对肥料、水分的消耗，改善通风透光的条件，增加桃数和多座大桃。全社除有专人负责整枝、灌溉和中耕等工作外，各生产队都组织了积肥队伍，展开积肥运动，保证棉田施肥需要。（朱波）
