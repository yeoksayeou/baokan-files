    The Da Chang Silk Factory That Produces No Substandard Products
    By our reporters Cheng Min and Li Xinmin

    In Huzhou, Zhejiang Province, near Taihu Lake, there is a silk factory with only a little over four hundred workers – the Da Chang Silk Factory. Although the factory is small, it is quite famous. From the second half of last year until now, eight or nine hundred people from silk factories in Jiangsu, Shanghai, Sichuan, Liaoning, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and other provinces have come to “learn from their experience.”

    The Da Chang Silk Factory is famous because of the high quality of its products. As early as 1957, this factory was recognized as having the best quality in the country. Last year, the average first-class product rate of the entire factory increased from 98.61% in 1957 to 99.25%, and it won the quality red banner in the first national silk factory competition.

    Since the beginning of this year, the average first-class product rate of the entire factory has been above 99.9% every month. In the workers' words, it has already reached "three nines." Among dozens of silk factories in Zhejiang Province, Da Chang Silk Factory is still at the forefront. When the first-class product rate has reached this level, it is extremely difficult to increase it by even 0.01%, but in May, this factory reached 99.96%.

    Why can the quality red banner fly here for a long time? This is a question that makes people interested.

    Old Machines, High Quality

    As soon as people enter the weaving workshop of this factory, they can see that almost all the silk looms are iron and wood machines that have been used for thirty or forty years. They use these old machines to weave high-quality silk fabrics.

    Once, this factory had to weave "Beautiful Silk," which is a blend of real silk and rayon, which is not easy to master. In the past, this factory had an old rule that the first piece of a new product would always be substandard. Now, whether this phenomenon can be changed and the honor of high quality maintained is a matter of concern to all employees of the factory.

    The factory leaders decided to break through this barrier. They organized several people, selected an old machine, and started trial weaving. These people surrounded the machine, carefully observed the mechanical operation, and concentrated on studying any problems they found, and immediately adjusted the machine and improved the operating methods. In this way, a very good piece of "Beautiful Silk" was woven! Through trial weaving, the workers also became familiar with the performance of the new product. The Party branch also held an on-site meeting next to this machine and put forward the call to "produce no substandard products when changing varieties." All forty machines in the factory weaving "Beautiful Silk" produced only first-class products.

    Although the machines are old, the workers use their own wisdom and experience to rejuvenate them. For example, weaving worker Wang Defang saw that the shuttle on the old machine often "derailed," breaking the warp threads and causing defects in the woven silk. He created a tool called the "shuttle-rolling warp protection insurance," which was installed on the machine, thus eliminating the problem of "shuttle-rolling."

    The workers know that one of the signs of silk quality is whether there are oil stains. Therefore, they carefully do cleaning work every day when they go to work, checking inside and out to prevent oil stains from easily appearing on the silk surface. The workers are all careful and diligent, and if they find situations that may cause defects, they take measures in advance to avoid them.

          Never Be Complacent

    Before visiting the Da Chang Silk Factory, we had been to many silk factories in Hangzhou and Wuxing County, and everywhere we went, they were "learning from Da Chang and catching up with Da Chang." However, the Party branch secretary of the Da Chang Silk Factory said very modestly: "The quality of the Yongchun Silk Factory in Hangzhou and the Yongchang Silk Factory in Wuxing is rising very fast, and we have to catch up with them." After a few days of interviews, we found that the branch secretary's humble attitude was not just politeness, but a guiding ideology that constantly spurred the entire factory forward.

    The factory leaders often remind employees to guard against arrogance and rashness, cherish honor, and maintain their advanced position by learning from the advanced.

    In June of last year, such a thing happened: A news item in the Hangzhou Daily said that the quality of the Happiness and Yongchun silk factories in Hangzhou had caught up with Da Chang. The blackboard newspaper of the Da Chang Silk Factory immediately reprinted this news, and the wired broadcast broadcast the news again and again. The Party branch held a meeting overnight to study how to learn from others' strengths and make up for one's own weaknesses. Then, a meeting of all cadres in the factory was held. At the meeting, the factory leaders said that although substandard products were basically eliminated in May, there were still quite a few leftover silk pieces, mainly due to complacency and backward thinking. As a result, the employees checked their work one after another, put forward six measures to improve quality based on the key points of production, and as a result, they created the highest record of first-class product rate in the history of the entire factory in June.

          Everyone Cares About Quality

    In the Da Chang Silk Factory, not producing substandard products has become a common practice. Whether it is leading cadres, office staff, workers, or even cooks and gatekeepers, they all care about quality. On the wall next to the factory gate, there is a quality comparison table, and the daily changes in product quality for each person are written on it. People are always crowded here when going to and from work. Even if someone's quality drops by 0.01%, everyone feels distressed.

    In the inspection room, workers use small scissors, magnifying glasses, eyebrow tweezers, and other tools to remove some small defects from the silk fabrics. The inspectors are mostly experienced old workers with rich silk weaving experience, and even the smallest defects cannot escape their eyes. They also often go to the weaving workshop to study methods of improving quality with the workers.

    Based on their production experience, the employees of this factory have formulated a set of systems to improve quality, including professional meetings on product names, head-to-head meetings of teams, and so on, totaling ten major items. The workers consciously implement the systems they have formulated themselves, day after day, year after year. Once, when young worker Yao Xixiong weaved "Flower Spinning" for the first time, he produced substandard products. The factory held a small professional meeting to help him analyze the reasons for the substandard products and put forward improvement methods. Yao Xixiong was very sad that he had produced substandard products. In order to make all the workers in the factory learn a lesson from this incident, he took the initiative to suggest holding another professional meeting with the participation of all the workers in the factory. The factory leaders accepted this suggestion, and Yao Xixiong made a self-criticism at the meeting. Since then, Yao Xixiong has never produced a foot of substandard silk.

    Here, at any time, the workers have a lofty sense of honor, which is to maintain the most advanced level in quality.

### 不出次货的达昌绸厂

    不出次货的达昌绸厂
    本报记者　程敏　李新民
    太湖附近的浙江省湖州市，有一家只有四百多工人的丝绸厂——达昌丝绸厂。工厂虽小，可是名气很大。从去年下半年到现在，从江苏、上海、四川、辽宁、江西、浙江等省的丝绸厂前来“取经”的，就有八、九百人。
    达昌丝绸厂所以有名，是因为产品质量好。还在1957年，这个厂就被公认为质量全国第一。去年，全厂的平均正品率，又从1957年的98.61％上升到99.25％，在全国各丝绸厂第一次评比中，得了质量红旗。
    今年以来，全厂平均正品率月月都是99.9％以上，照工人的说法，已经有了“三个九”。在浙江省几十个丝绸厂中，达昌丝绸厂还是名列前茅。正品率已经达到这个水平，再上升0.01％，都是极其困难的，可是，5月份，这个厂又达到了99.96％。
    为什么质量红旗能长期在这里飘扬？这是使人感到兴趣的问题。
    机器老　质量高
    人们一走进这个厂的织造车间，就可以看到，几乎所有织绸机都是使用了三、四十年的铁木机。他们就是用这些老机器，织出了质量很好的绸缎。
    有一次，这个厂要织“美丽绸”，这是真丝和人造丝的交织品，不易掌握。过去这个厂有个老常规，改品种第一匹，必出次货。现在，能不能改变这种现象，保持优质的荣誉，这是全厂职工都关心的问题。
    工厂领导决定突破这一关。他们组织了几个人，选定一台老机器，先行试织，这几个人围在机器旁边，仔细观察着机械的运转情况，发现问题就集中研究，马上调整机械，改进操作方法，这样，一匹很好的“美丽绸”织出来了！通过试织，工人们也熟悉了新品种的性能。党支部又在这台机器旁边召开了现场会议，提出“改品种不出次货”的号召。全厂有四十台机器织造“美丽绸”，每匹都是正品。
    机器虽老，职工们用自己的智慧和经验，使它返老还童。例如：织绸工王德芳看到老机器上的梭子常常“出轨”，把经线弄断，织出的绸就产生病疵，他就创造了一个工具名叫“轧梭护经保险”，装到机器上，从此消灭了“轧梭”的毛病。
    工人们知道，绸缎质量的标志之一，就是有没有油渍。因此，他们每天上班，总要细心地作好清洁工作，里里外外检查一番，不使绸面轻易发生油渍。工人们个个细心、勤快，如果发现可能产生病疵的情况，就预先设法避免。
          永不自满
    在访问达昌丝绸厂以前，我们到过杭州和吴兴县的许多丝绸厂，到处都在“学达昌，赶达昌”。可是，达昌丝绸厂的党支部书记却很谦逊地说：“杭州的永春丝绸厂和吴兴的永昌丝绸厂，质量上升很快，我们得赶他们了。”经过几天的采访，我们发现，支部书记这种谦逊态度，丝毫不是客气，而是一种时刻鞭策全厂前进的指导思想。
    工厂的领导经常提醒职工戒骄戒躁，爱护荣誉，要从学先进中保持先进。
    去年6月，发生了这样一件事：杭州日报的消息说，杭州市幸福、永春两个丝绸厂的质量已赶上达昌。达昌丝绸厂的黑板报马上转载了这个消息，有线广播把这个消息播了一遍又一遍。党支部连夜开会研究，怎样取人之长，补己之短。接着，开了全厂的干部会议，会上，工厂的领导说，5月份虽然基本消灭次货，但零料绸还不少，主要是存在着自满情绪，思想落后于形势。这一来，职工们纷纷检查工作，针对生产关键，提出六条提高质量的措施，结果，6月份就创造了全厂历史上正品率的最高纪录。
          人人关心质量
    在达昌丝绸厂，不出次品已经成了一种风气。不论是领导干部、科室人员、工人、甚至炊事员、传达员，都很关心质量。工厂大门旁的墙上，贴着一张质量比较表，每天每人的产品质量变化情况都写在上面，上下班，这里都围满了人。那怕有人质量下降0.01％，所有的人都感到痛心。
    在检验室里，工人们用小剪刀、放大镜、眉毛镊等工具，把绸缎上某些细小的病疵剔除掉。检验人员大都是织绸经验很丰富的老工人，那怕一点极小的病疵也逃不过他们的眼睛。他们还经常到织造车间去，和工人一起研究提高质量的办法。
    这个厂的职工根据生产经验，制订了一套提高质量的制度，包括品名专业会议，班的碰头会等等十大项。工人们自觉地执行自己订出来的制度，几年如一日。有一次，青年工人姚希熊第一次织“花纺”，出了次品，厂里开了小型专业会议，帮助他分析产生次品的原因，提出改进办法。姚希熊出了一次次品自己很难过。为了使全厂工人从这件事上得到教训，他主动建议再开一次全厂职工参加的专业会议，厂领导接受了这个意见，姚希熊在大会上作了检查。从那以后，姚希熊再没有出过一尺次绸缎。
    在这里，任何时候，工人都有一种崇高的荣誉感，这就是在质量上保持最先进水平。
