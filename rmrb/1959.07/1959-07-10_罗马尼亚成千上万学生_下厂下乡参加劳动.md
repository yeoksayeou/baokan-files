Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest. In accordance with the educational policy of linking schools with life and combining education with productive labor, thousands of students at all levels of schools in Romania are currently participating in voluntary labor and production internships in factories and rural areas under the organization of the Labor Youth League.

This year, university students have been particularly enthusiastic in signing up for voluntary labor. Currently, about 8,000 university students across the country are helping with the summer harvest on state farms or working on various construction sites. They have all shown high enthusiasm for labor and are prepared to win the patriotic voluntary labor red flag awarded by the Central Committee of the Labor Youth League for their schools after three weeks of labor.

Recently, about 10,000 students from polytechnic schools have also begun production internships in metallurgical plants, machine manufacturing plants, and chemical plants in various regions. Some students are also preparing to participate in a period of voluntary labor after completing their internships.

According to the regulations of the Romanian Ministry of Education and Culture, students in grades five to seven of seven-year schools, and students in grades five to ten of eleven-year schools must participate in internships in factories or rural areas during the summer vacation. At present, there are about 40,000 students interning in factories in Bucharest. Many students in other regions have also started production internships.

    罗马尼亚成千上万学生
    下厂下乡参加劳动
    据新华社布加勒斯特讯  根据学校和生活联系、教育同生产劳动相结合的教育方针，目前罗马尼亚有成千上万的各级学校的学生在劳动青年联盟的组织下正在工厂和农村参加义务劳动和生产实习。
    今年报名参加义务劳动的大学生特别踊跃。现在全国约有八千名大学生正在国营农场帮助夏收或在各种建设工地上劳动。他们都表现了高涨的劳动热情，都准备在三个星期的劳动结束后能为自己的学校争得劳动青年联盟中央颁发的爱国义务劳动红旗。
    最近，约有一万名理工学校的学生也在各地的冶金工厂、机器制造厂和化学工厂中开始了生产实习。有些学生在实习结束后还准备参加一段时间的义务劳动。
    根据罗马尼亚教育和文化部的规定，七年制学校的五年级到七年级的学生，十一年制学校的五年级到十年级的学生在暑假中都要到工厂或农村实习。目前，在布加勒斯特各工厂实习的学生已有四万名左右。其它各地的许多学生也都开始了生产实习。
