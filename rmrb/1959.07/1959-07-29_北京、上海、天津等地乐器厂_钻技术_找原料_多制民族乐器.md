Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Other Musical Instrument Factories
	Focus on Technology, Find Raw Materials, and Produce More National Musical Instruments

(Our dispatch) The production of national musical instruments, beloved by the vast number of people in our country, is showing a new landscape. In the first half of this year, the production of various national musical instruments in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Suzhou, Guangzhou, Chengdu and other regions increased by more than double compared with the same period last year.

China's national musical instruments have a long history. The Suzhou xiao and flute, famous throughout the country, were already popular in the Ming Dynasty; the Guizhou Yuping xiao, with its exquisite carvings, is not only a musical instrument, but also a fine work of art. China's national musical instruments are diverse and colorful. According to statistics, there are more than 200 kinds of musical instruments. With the development of various operas and the improvement of people's cultural life, the demand for national musical instruments has also increased dramatically. In order to adapt to objective needs, national musical instrument factories in various places launched a high-yield and high-quality campaign in the first half of this year. The Beijing National Musical Instrument Factory produced more than 6,700 Jinghu, more than 7,800 Erhu, more than 16,000 Nanhu, 182 percussion instruments, and 2.5 tons of gongs and cymbals in the first half of the year. Compared with the same period last year, Jinghu increased by more than four times; Erhu increased by nearly three times; Nanhu increased by 5.6 times; and percussion instruments increased by more than one time. The Shandong Zibo Ludong Musical Instrument Factory produced more than 34,000 jin of gongs and cymbals in the first half of the year. The Shanghai National Musical Instrument Factory strengthened enterprise management and established a quality inspection system, and the quality of products has been significantly improved. In June, the percentage of qualified Huqin, xiao, flute, Pipa, and stringed instruments reached 97%-98%, and the percentage of qualified percussion instruments reached 100%. Various musical instrument factories have also collaborated with professional groups to trial-produce more than 20 new products, such as Hongyin Guqin, transposing Guzheng, keyed wind instruments, keyed flutes, transposing large Yangqin, and rotary Sheng, with good results. Local opera instruments with strong local characteristics have also received due attention and development. The Zhuihu, which is popular among the masses, the large drum popular in Northeast storytelling and singing, the gongs and drums used in Sichuan opera, and the "Dombura", "Dutar", hand drums, and flutes commonly seen in Xinjiang Uygur dance have all increased significantly, adding a lot of color and sound to local operas.

The production of national musical instruments was originally done by hand, and the production efficiency was not high. In order to quickly achieve high yields, various factories launched mass technical innovations. The employees of the Shanghai National Musical Instrument Factory proposed 105 technical innovation projects in the second quarter of this year, and 91 of them have now been realized. For example, the created planing machine and milling machine have increased efficiency by ten times, greatly reducing the labor intensity of workers. In April, the Beijing No. 1 Musical Instrument Cooperative improved 16 tools. Due to the improvement of the tools, the production of the Qin tubes increased from 30 to 150 per day. These technical innovations have moved the manual production of national musical instruments a step closer to mechanization or semi-mechanization.

The raw materials for national musical instruments are complex and the specifications are strict, while the seasonal nature of raw material production is very large, and the natural drying period is long. Among the main raw materials, some are rare domestic woods such as rosewood, sandalwood, and boxwood, as well as python skin, snake skin, and horse tails of a certain length, as well as special purple bamboo, yellowed bamboo, Jian bamboo, and phoenix-eye bamboo. Now, in addition to the procurement personnel organized by the Central Ministry of Light Industry going to the producing areas to purchase, various factories are also taking self-reliance measures to solve the problem of raw materials. The Chongqing Musical Instrument Factory uses accordion scraps to make Erhu, and this one factory alone can save 18 cubic meters of wood throughout the year for this one type of instrument. Without affecting the sound quality, many factories actively use substitutes. The Shanghai National Musical Instrument Factory has produced 6,000 Erhu using puffer fish skin instead of python skin; the Suzhou and Chengdu Musical Instrument Factories have initially succeeded in using satin coated with plastic to replace python skin; the Beijing Musical Instrument Factory has achieved good results by using yellow snake skin and mounting silk to replace python skin.

### 北京、上海、天津等地乐器厂  钻技术　找原料　多制民族乐器

    北京、上海、天津等地乐器厂
    钻技术　找原料　多制民族乐器
    本报讯　我国广大人民喜爱的民族乐器在生产上出现一片新景象。今年上半年，北京、上海、天津、苏州、广州、成都等地区生产的各种民族乐器比去年同期增长一倍以上。
    我国的民族乐器，有着悠久的历史。闻名全国的苏州箫笛，早在明代就已流行；贵州玉屏箫，雕刻精致，不仅是乐器，而且还是很好的艺术品。我国民族乐器的品种繁多，丰富多彩。据统计，各种乐器有二百多种。随着各种戏曲的发展和人民文化生活水平的提高，对民族乐器的需要量也激剧地增加。各地民族乐器厂，为了适应客观需要，今年上半年掀起了高产优质运动。北京民族乐器厂，上半年生产了京胡六千七百多把，二胡七千八百多把，南胡一万六千多把，打琴一百八十二把，锣钗二吨半。和去年同期比较，京胡增长四倍多；二胡增长将近三倍；南胡增长五点六倍；打琴增长一倍以上。山东淄博鲁东乐器厂，上半年生产了三万四千多斤锣钗。上海市民族乐器厂加强了企业管理，建立质量检验制度，产品质量有了显著的提高。6月份胡琴、箫笛、琵琶、弦子等正品率达到97％—98％，打琴的正品率已达到100％。各乐器厂还和专业团体协作试制了二十多种新产品，如宏音古琴、转调古筝、加键管、加键笛、变调大扬琴、转盘笙等，效果较好。有着强烈地方色彩的地方戏曲乐器，也得到应有重视与发展。群众喜爱的坠胡、流行东北说唱的大鼓、川戏用的锣鼓和新疆维吾尔族舞蹈中常见的“冬布拉”、“都?塔”、手鼓、笛子等，都有较大增长，为地方戏曲增添不少声色。
    民族乐器生产，原来是手工操作，生产效率不高，为了迅速达到高产，各厂开展了群众性技术革新。上海民族乐器厂的职工，今年第二季度提出技术革新项目一百零五件，现在已实现九十一件。如创造的刨板机、铣軡机都提高效率十倍，大大减轻了工人的劳动强度。北京市第一乐器合作社4月份改进了十六项工具，由于工具的改进，并琴筒的生产每天由三十个提高到一百五十个。这些技术革新，把民族乐器手工生产向机械化或半机械化推前了一步。
    民族乐器原料用材复杂，规格严格，而原料产期的季节性很大，自然干燥期长。主要原料中，有些是国内稀有的木材如红木、紫檀、黄杨，还有蟒皮、蛇皮，要有一定长度的马尾，还有特种的紫竹、黄枯竹、笕竹、凤眼竹等。现在除由中央轻工业部组织采购人员分赴产地采购，各厂还采取自力更生的办法解决原材料。重庆乐器厂利用手风琴下脚料做二胡，单这一个厂，这一项乐器全年就可节约木材十八立方米。在不影响音响效果前提下，许多厂积极采用代用品。上海民族乐器厂以河豚鱼皮代替蟒皮制二胡，已生产六千把；苏州、成都乐器厂用缎子涂塑料代蟒皮，初步成功；北京乐器厂利用黄蛇皮蒙绢代蟒皮，效果很好。
