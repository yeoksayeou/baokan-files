Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 10th – Workers in the Wuxi City iron smelting system, under the slogan of "Love coal like grain, save coal to produce more iron," are doing everything possible to save coal and increase pig iron production. The average coal consumption per ton of pig iron in small blast furnaces with a volume of 13 to 15.8 cubic meters in the city was 0.84 tons less than the prescribed standard in the second quarter. According to the city's Metallurgical Bureau, due to the saving of smelting coal, the city's small blast furnaces produced a total of 1,400 tons more pig iron in the second quarter, and also transferred more than 4,800 tons of coke to support other industrial departments.

After a year of development, Wuxi City's iron smelting industry has laid a certain foundation in equipment and technical strength, and workers' operating skills are also relatively skilled. However, the local area does not produce coal, and it is relatively far from coal-producing areas, making coal transportation relatively difficult. Therefore, how to smelt more iron with less coal, and seek increased production from savings, has become the key to increasing pig iron production in the city. In view of this situation, the Wuxi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Wuxi Municipal Metallurgical Industry authorities, with saving coal as the center, strengthened specific leadership over departments such as transportation, coal washing, coking, and iron smelting, regularly checked the coal and coke saving situation in these departments, and stipulated methods such as supplying coke in fixed quantities according to pig iron production to control coke consumption; at the same time, the indicators for saving coal and coke were listed as an important part of the evaluation work of various departments.

From the Wuxi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China to the factory Party branches, Party organizations at all levels regularly educated workers to save coal and coke. Through education, workers in various departments established a firm concept of conservation, and worked together to find ways to reduce coal consumption and lower the coke ratio from all aspects.

Various iron smelting and coking units have generally improved the roads for transporting coke and coal, and some have even laid special tracks to reduce losses of coal and coke during transportation. All the coal in the city's two coking plants has been washed and selected. They have made a semi-foreign, semi-native jig-type combined coal washing machine, which turns manual coal washing into mechanical coal washing, making coal washing faster and better. They have also improved the structure of coking earthen kilns, increased kiln temperature, and implemented the operating methods of frequent inspection, frequent ventilation, and frequent sealing, which increased the coke yield by 10% compared with the second half of last year, and also reduced the sulfur and ash content of coke. Various iron smelting plants have also reduced coke consumption by improving operating techniques and strengthening stockyard management. After taking these measures, the city's small blast furnace coke ratio averaged 1.285 in the second quarter, the average utilization coefficient of blast furnaces reached 1.15, and the quality of iron also improved.

(Jinan Electric News from this newspaper) Qingdao and Jinan cities in Shandong Province have mobilized workers to find tricks and think of ways to save industrial coal, and have created some effective coal-saving experiences.

Qingdao Chengyang No. 2 Iron and Steel Plant improved coal-burning equipment, using "continuous kilns" instead of "ground-running kilns" to calcine ore, improve output, ensure quality, and greatly reduce coal consumption. After the improvement, each ton of coal can calcine thirty tons of ore, reducing coal consumption by more than 63% compared with the original. In forging iron, there is also great potential for saving coal. The Qingdao Wensheng Furnace Factory created a "forging iron preheating furnace," adding a preheating channel to the furnace, using waste heat from the flue to preheat twelve steel materials at a time, greatly reducing the formal heating time. Each rear axle sleeve can be reduced from 56 kilograms of coal in the past to 20 kilograms.

Saving industrial coal and improving coal-burning technology is a very important part. Jinan Knitting Factory improved coal-burning technology in May, mastering the principles of "frequent addition, less addition, even spreading, and thorough burning," and adopted the method of smothering fire outside the furnace, so that the average monthly coal consumption dropped from 100 tons to 60 tons, and the forging time per furnace dropped from 10 hours to 4.5 hours, with good product quality. In terms of coking, Chengyang Chemical Plant improved the coking technology by lowering the ignition platform, widening the fire channel, and thinning and raising the chimney. At the same time, in the operating method, they mastered the three diligence operations of frequent punching, frequent watching of the fire, and frequent catching up to the top (that is, watching the fire color to seal the top to avoid coking), and the coke yield increased from 50% to 78%. Jining City Coking Plant also successfully tested burning lime with coking waste fire, and each 30-ton coke pool can burn 5,000 jin of stone, producing 3,000 jin of pure lime.

At present, Shandong Province is organizing and systematically promoting these effective preliminary experiences in various places, so that saving coal can achieve greater results. (Attached picture)

### 无锡千方百计节约用煤多产生铁  济南青岛职工改进设备提高烧煤技术创造省煤经验

    无锡千方百计节约用煤多产生铁
    济南青岛职工改进设备提高烧煤技术创造省煤经验
    据新华社南京10日电　无锡市炼铁系统职工，在“爱煤如爱粮，省煤多炼铁”的口号下，千方百计地节约用煤，增产生铁。全市容积在十三立方米到十五点八立方米的小高炉，炼每吨生铁的耗煤量第二季度已平均比规定标准少零点八四吨。据市冶金局统计，由于节约冶炼用煤，全市小高炉在第二季度共多炼了一千四百吨生铁，同时还调出四千八百多吨焦炭支援其他工业部门。
    无锡市炼铁工业经过一年来的发展，在设备和技术力量上已经打下了一定的基础，工人的操作技术也比较熟练。但是，当地不产煤，离产煤地区又比较远，煤炭运输比较困难，因此如何以较少的煤炼出更多的铁，从节约中求增产，就成为全市增产生铁的关键。根据这种情况，中共无锡市委和无锡市冶金工业主管部门以节约用煤为中心，加强了对运输、洗煤、炼焦、炼铁等部门的具体领导、经常检查这些部门节约用煤用焦的情况，规定按生铁产量定量供应焦炭等办法，控制焦炭的消耗量；同时将节约用煤用焦的指标列为各部门评比工作的一项重要内容。
    中共无锡市委到工厂党支部，各级党组织都经常教育职工节约煤、焦。通过教育，使各部门的职工们树立起牢固的节约思想，齐心协力地从各方面设法减少煤耗，降低焦比。
    各炼铁炼焦单位，普遍改善了运焦运煤的道路，有的还铺设专门的轨道，减少煤、焦在运输中的损失。全市两家炼焦厂全部的煤都经过了洗选，他们制成了一种半洋半土的跳汰式联合洗煤机，把人工洗煤改为机械洗煤，使煤洗得既快又好。他们还改进了炼焦土窑结构，提高了窑温，并且实行勤检查、勤通火、勤封闭的操作方法，使出焦率比去年下半年提高10％，同时降低了焦的含硫量和灰分。各个炼铁厂也从改进操作技术，加强料场管理等方面减少焦炭的消耗。采取这些措施以后，全市第二季度小高炉焦比平均达到一点二八五，高炉平均利用系数达到一点一五，铁的质量也提高了。
    本报济南电　山东省青岛、济南两市，发动职工找窍门想办法节约工业用煤，已创造出一些行之有效的省煤经验。
    青岛市城阳第二钢铁厂改进烧煤设备，用“连续窑”代替“地跑窑”焙烧矿石，提高产量，保证质量，并大大降低煤耗，改进后每吨煤可焙烧矿石三十吨，较原来降低耗煤量63％以上。在锻铁方面，节约用煤的潜力也很大，青岛文盛炉工厂创造“锻铁预热炉”，在炉上增设一个预热道，利用烟道余火每次可预热十二根钢料，大大减少正式加热时间，每根后轴套管可由过去用煤五十六公斤降到二十公斤。
    节约工业用煤，提高烧煤技术是很重要的一环，济南针织厂5月份改进了烧煤技术，掌握“勤添、少添、撒匀烧透”的原则，并采取炉外焖火的办法，使每月平均耗煤量由一百吨降为六十吨，每炉锻烧时间由十小时降到四点五小时，产品质量良好。在炼焦方面，城阳化工厂用降低点火台，加宽火道和将烟囱改细加高的办法改进了炼焦技术，同时在操作方法上掌握了勤打洞、勤看火、勤赶顶（即看火色封顶避免化焦）的三勤操作法，出焦率由50％提高到78％。济宁市炼焦厂还试验成功以炼焦废火烧石灰，每三十吨的焦池可烧石头五千斤，出净石灰三千斤。
    目前，山东省正在各地有组织有步骤的推广这些行之有效的初步经验，使节约煤炭获得更大成绩。（附图片）
