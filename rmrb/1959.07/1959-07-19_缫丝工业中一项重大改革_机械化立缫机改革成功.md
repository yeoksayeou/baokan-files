    A Major Reform in the Silk Reeling Industry
    Mechanized Vertical Reeling Machine Reform Successful

    (Our report) A mechanized vertical silk reeling machine has been successfully reformed in Zhejiang Province. Currently, one-third of the vertical reeling frames in silk reeling factories throughout the province have achieved partial mechanization. Using the reformed vertical reeling machine increases productivity by 1% to over 10% compared to the original vertical reeling frame, and basically eliminates phenomena such as "entangled silk" and "uneven color." It also reduces the labor intensity of workers and can lower the temperature and humidity in the workshops.

    With the vertical reeling frame, everything from feeding cocoons, reeling silk, to removing pupae is done by a silk reeling worker using their hands or simple tools. Sometimes, the operations are very hectic, affecting the improvement of production volume and quality.

    Not long ago, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Industry and the Hangzhou Municipal Textile Industry Bureau organized relevant leading cadres, maintenance workers, and technical personnel from various silk reeling factories. After months of repeated experiments, they finally successfully reformed three sets of mechanized vertical reeling machines.

    These three sets of reformed reeling machines consist of fourteen or eighteen original vertical reeling frames as a whole. Machines are installed at both ends. From silk stripping, thread sorting, feeding cocoons to pupae removal, all are done by mechanical operation. The main operations for workers have been reduced from the original twelve to six.

    缫丝工业中一项重大改革
    机械化立缫机改革成功
    本报讯　一种机械化立式缫丝机已经在浙江省改革成功。目前，全省各缫丝厂已有三分之一的立缫车实现了部分机械化操作。用立缫机缫丝比原来的立缫车提高生产率1％到10％以上，基本上消灭了“夹花丝”、“色不匀”等现象。并降低了工人劳动强度，还可以降低车间的温湿度。
    用立缫车缫丝，从送茧子、缫丝直到把蛹排出去，都由一个缫丝工人用双手或用简单工具来做，有时操作很忙乱，影响产量质量的提高。
    不久以前，浙江省工业厅和杭州市纺织工业管理局组织各缫丝厂有关领导干部、保全工人和技术人员，经过几个月反复试验，终于改装成功了三组机械化立缫机。
    这三组改革后的立缫机，是把原来的立缫车，以十四或十八台组成一个整体，在两头安装了机械，从索绪、理绪、送茧到排蛹，都用机械操作，工人的主要操作从原来十二项减少到六项。　（苏烈山）
