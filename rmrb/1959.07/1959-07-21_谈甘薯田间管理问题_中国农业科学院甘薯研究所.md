Discussing Field Management Problems of Sweet Potatoes
Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Sweet Potato Research Institute

Editor's Note: This article raises a new and important issue regarding sweet potato field management: sweet potatoes should not be turned or lifted, as turning or lifting the vines reduces yield compared to not doing so. We hope that sweet potato producing areas will pay attention to this issue and organize the masses to study and promote it earnestly.

In the process of sweet potato cultivation, field management is a very important task. The great sweet potato harvest of 1958 proved the great importance of field management. The role of field management is to adjust the activity process of each growth stage of sweet potatoes, create the most favorable conditions for sweet potato growth, and improve yield and quality.

Each growth stage of sweet potatoes is interconnected and mutually influential. Any stage that is "wronged" will affect the growth and development of the next stage, and even the overall situation. Experiments have shown that the growth rate of stems and leaves and the timing of tuber formation depend on the survival rate, the survival rate depends on the rooting rate, and the rooting rate depends on the cutting technique and whether the leaves on the seedlings fall off. Therefore, strengthening field management after cutting to ensure that the leaves do not fall off has a significant impact on yield.

Early Stage Field Management

The period from cutting to ridging is the early stage of sweet potato growth. The characteristics of plants in this stage are that the root system and stems and leaves are not yet developed, and the resistance to adversity is weak. The focus of field management is to strive for five earlies: early replanting, early recovery, early branching, early tuber formation, and early ridging.

1. Early Replanting: After cutting, check frequently, and fill in missing plants in time. Replanting late will result in plants receiving less light, not growing well, and not forming tubers. The saying "sweet potatoes do not fill the room" emphasizes the importance of early replanting.

2. Early Recovery: The start of new buds on sweet potato seedlings after cutting is called recovery. Striving for early recovery can correspondingly advance the time of branching, tuber formation, and ridging. The speed of recovery varies depending on the quality of the seedlings, planting techniques, soil moisture, and light intensity. In dry conditions, water frequently in small amounts and loosen the soil. When the sunlight is too strong, cover the seedlings with leaves, etc.

3. Early Branching, Early Tuber Formation, and Early Ridging: After recovery, strive for early branching. Under normal circumstances, tuber formation begins with branching. Early branching will correspondingly advance the tuber formation period and the ridging period. The timing of ridging is closely related to when the stems and leaves reach their most vigorous stage. In order to achieve these "three earlies," the following measures should be taken:

(1) Watering: After recovery, watering is still necessary in dry conditions. Water should be applied before leaf collapse occurs, preferably maintaining the soil in a state of 30% dry and 60% wet.

(2) Topdressing: From recovery to ridging, apply one to two applications of fast-acting nitrogen fertilizer according to the growth situation, each time applying 3,000 to 5,000 catties of dilute human waste per mu to accelerate plant growth. If the potassium fertilizer in the base fertilizer is insufficient, also apply potassium-rich fertilizers such as wood ash to promote tuber formation.

(3) Intertillage and Weeding: At this stage, sweet potato seedlings are not yet growing vigorously and cannot compete with weeds, so weeds must be removed. About three weeks after planting, is the tuber formation period, and the soil should be loose and breathable. From cutting to ridging, generally intertill and weed three times: During the first intertillage, the root system does not extend deeply, and the tillage depth can reach about one and a half inches. The depth of the second and third intertillage should not exceed one inch to avoid root damage. In dry conditions, increase the number of intertillage to strengthen moisture retention. In waterlogged areas, also increase the number of intertillage to allow the soil to breathe.

(4) Frequent and Shallow Soil Hilling: When hilling soil, it should not be thicker than the original ridge soil, and it is important to master shallow and frequent hilling. Thickening the soil will bury several nodes at the base of the plant in the soil, relatively making the original tuber-forming parts in a deeper soil layer, which is not ventilated, and the growth of tubers is affected. Hilling too wide will also affect ventilation.

Late Stage Field Management

The period from ridging to harvest is the late stage of growth. The characteristics of this stage are that the stems and leaves grow vigorously, and the tubers expand rapidly. The focus of field management is to protect the rapid growth of stems and leaves and create the most favorable conditions for tuber growth. The specific measures are:

1. Turning Vines Will Reduce Yield: After the stems and leaves cover the ridges, generally do not turn the vines or lift them, because moving the vines will damage them and affect yield.

The East China Academy of Agricultural Sciences conducted two years of experiments in Nanjing. Turning the vines reduced yield by 13.6%-16.8% compared to not turning the vines. The Shandong Academy of Agricultural Sciences experimented in Jinan and also proved that lifting the vines twice reduced yield by 6.13% compared to not lifting or turning them. Experiments conducted by the North China Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the Anhui Agricultural Experiment Station, and the Huaiyin Agricultural Experiment Station have also consistently proven that turning the vines reduces yield.

Is it okay not to turn the vines in rainy conditions? In 1958, Suqian County was a rainy year. The Sweet Potato Research Institute used Victory No. 100 as material for experiments, proving that turning the vines reduced yield by 27.2% compared to not turning the vines. The experiment also proved that lifting the vines or building trellises also reduced yield compared to not turning the vines.

Some people also suspect that if the vines are not turned, what should be done with the small sweet potatoes that grow on the vines? We believe that yield depends not only on the size of the tubers, but also on the number of tubers. What we hope for is many and large tubers. Therefore, growing more small sweet potatoes is not a bad thing. In 1956, the high-yielding field of Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Zhangpu, Fujian, with a yield of 15,000 catties per mu, had small sweet potatoes growing on the vines (by weight) accounting for about one-fifth, according to field observations in November, because the vines were not turned. And the annual rainfall in Zhangpu County that year was more than 1,300 mm. This also shows that in rainy conditions, it is also possible not to turn the vines. Generally, people who advocate turning the vines believe that the roots on the vines will consume nutrients. In fact, these roots can also absorb water and nutrients. They are not consumer organs, but "producers." From the perspective of biological evolution, the habit of sweet potato vines rooting on the ground is the result of natural selection. This habit is beneficial to the growth of sweet potato plants.

We advocate not turning the vines because turning them will damage some of the stems and leaves. Stems and leaves are the organs that manufacture nutrients. If they are damaged, the plant's synthetic ability will be weakened. From an agricultural economic point of view, turning the vines requires labor. Therefore, even if turning the vines and not turning the vines have the same yield, not turning the vines is worthwhile, let alone that turning the vines will cause a reduction in yield!

2. Cutting Vines Will Reduce Yield: In some places, in order to prevent disease or solve the problem of seedling shortage, vines are sometimes cut from large fields. This is a last resort, but there is an incorrect view that cutting vines is a yield-increasing measure, so it is advocated to cut a large number of vines in large fields. Our experimental results with Victory No. 100 prove that the more you cut, the more severely the tubers are reduced in yield. (See attached table)

Yangbei Commune used the Kyushu No. 7 variety for observation, and Xiaodian Commune used Victory No. 100 as material for observation, and sweet potatoes were reduced in yield.

These results consistently show that the vines and leaves are the organs that manufacture nutrients and should be well protected.

3. Strengthen Drainage and Irrigation: July and August are the period when tubers expand, and excessive rainfall will make the ridge soil too wet or cause waterlogging. As mentioned earlier, sweet potato tubers need sufficient air. Overly wet ridge soil will reduce the air in the soil, and the tubers will grow slowly or even rot. Therefore, drainage work is very important in the rainy season. In 1958, some places made drainage ditches in the shape of "cross," "field," and "enclosure" according to the terrain, which received good results. Many locally rotted tubers recovered their growth after drainage. The practice in 1958 also proved that making horizontal ridges (perpendicular to other ridges) on the edge of the field is not conducive to drainage.

4. Topdressing Fertilizer: After the vines and leaves cover the ridges, open ditches and apply wood ash once, 300 to 500 catties per mu. After half a month to a month, apply another application. From late August to September (the end of sweet potato growth), spray 1% superphosphate solution two or three times; and alternately spray 13% wood ash water two or three times. This can strengthen the transport of assimilated substances in the leaves and increase the yield of tubers.

Pest Control Issues

During the growth of sweet potatoes, they are often threatened by various pests. After planting, underground pests (including cutworms, mole crickets, wireworms, golden needle worms, etc.) occur successively, harming seedlings; after tubers are formed, they continue to feed on the tubers, causing yield reduction and rotting. The control of underground pests should be carried out before planting. Apply 6 catties of 0.5% 666 powder per mu, mixed evenly with 1,000 catties of fine soil, and spread it in the ridge soil; at the same time, use 2 taels of 6% 666 powder and 3 catties of soybean cake to make toxic grain, and spread it on the ridge topsoil before planting, or apply the toxic grain after planting in combination with weeding, which can achieve certain results. In areas where cutworms are severely harmful, toxic bait can also be used for trapping and killing, and manual capture.

In 1958, Spodoptera litura was very harmful, occurring from June to September, especially in August, when the harm was most serious. Sweet potato leaves were eaten with holes, especially in the sweet potato fields near the village, early planted, and well-grown. To control Spodoptera litura, it is necessary to grasp the principle of "treating small, treating early, and treating thoroughly." When larvae occur in mid-to-late July, spray 5% 223 powder once in the affected areas, 3 catties per mu. After that, pay attention to key prevention and control to solve the problem. We conducted a test on the insecticidal effect of pesticides. When Spodoptera litura was in the second instar, spraying 5% 223 powder achieved a 100% kill rate; spraying 6% wettable 666 200 times liquid, 1605 4,000 times liquid, or 223 emulsion 1 catty mixed with 605 1 tael, and diluted with 500 catties of water, the kill rate was above 90%. However, when the larvae reached the fifth instar, the kill rate was only about 50%. Other pests such as leaf rollers and sweet potato hawkmoths can be treated in the same way as Spodoptera litura.

The sweet potato weevil in southern regions is also very harmful to sweet potatoes. In the past, surveys in Guangdong showed that the infestation rate was above 10%-20%. After the tubers are eaten, they are drilled into wounds or holes, resulting in the so-called stinky potato phenomenon. Sweet potato weevils also harm seedlings. Adults feed on stems and leaves, seriously affecting growth, often causing seedlings to deteriorate, and even causing plants to die in severe cases. When controlling this insect in the field, sweet potato tubers can be mixed with 666 powder and sprinkled on the ground for trapping and killing. After the tubers are fattened, the soil should be hilled in time to prevent the sweet potatoes from being exposed to the soil surface, so as to reduce pest infestation.

    谈甘薯田间管理问题
    中国农业科学院甘薯研究所
    编者按　这篇文章对甘薯田间管理工作提出了一个新的重要问题：甘薯不应翻藤、提藤，凡是翻藤、提藤的都比不翻的减了产。我们希望甘薯产区重视这个问题，并组织群众认真研究推广。
    在甘薯栽培过程中，田间管理是一项很重要的工作。1958年的甘薯大丰收，证明了田间管理的极大重要性。田间管理的作用，在于调整甘薯各生育期的活动过程，给甘薯生育创造最优越的条件，提高产量和质量。
    甘薯的各个生育阶段都是彼此关联、彼此影响着的，任何一个阶段受到“委屈”，就会影响后一阶段的生长发育，以至影响全局。试验证明，茎叶生长速度和结薯的早迟，决定于成活速度，成活速度决定于发根速度，而发根速度决定于扦插技术和薯苗上的叶子是否脱落。所以扦插后加强田间管理，保证薯叶不脱落，对产量是有显著影响的。
      前期的田间管理
    甘薯从扦插到封垅为生长前期。这一阶段植株的特点是根系和茎叶还不发达，抗逆性弱，田间管理重点是争取五早，即早补苗、早还苗、早分枝、早结薯、早封垅。
    一、早补苗：扦插后要随时检查，缺株应及时补足。补迟了，植株受光少，长不起来，不结薯块，群众说：“甘薯不填房”，就是强调要早补苗的意思。
    二、早还苗：扦插后薯苗开始抽新芽叫做还苗。争取早还苗就可相应提早分枝、结薯、封垅的时间。还苗快慢因薯苗品质、栽插技术、土壤水分、光照强度而有差别。干旱时，应勤浇小水、松土；阳光过于强烈时，要用树叶等复盖薯苗。
    三、早分枝、早结薯、早封垅：还苗以后应争取早分枝，在一般情况下，随着分枝就开始结薯。分枝早，结薯期就相应提早，封垅期也相应提早。而封垅期的早迟和茎叶达到最旺盛时期又很有关系。为着达到这“三早”，要采取以下措施：
      （1）浇水：还苗以后，遇到干旱仍要浇水。水要在未发生塌叶现象以前浇，最好是保持土壤有三成干六成湿的状态。
      （2）追肥：从还苗到封垅按生长情况追一至二次速效性氮，每亩每次施稀薄人粪尿三到五千斤，加速植株生长。基肥中钾肥不足的，还要追含钾丰富的肥料如草木灰等，以促进薯块的形成。
      （3）中耕除草：这一阶段薯苗生长还不旺，不能与杂草竞争，因此有草必除。播后约三周左右，是结薯时期，土壤要疏松透气。从扦插到封垅，一般中耕除草三次：第一次中耕时，根系伸展还不深，耕深可达一寸半左右；第二、三次中耕深度不宜超过一寸，以免伤根。干旱时应增加中耕次数，加强保墒。受涝的地方，也应增加中耕次数，使土壤透气。
      （4）勤培土，浅培土：培土时不能比原来的垅土厚，要掌握浅培、勤培。培厚了，就会把植株基部的几节埋到土中，相对的使原来结薯的部位处于较深的土层，不通气，薯块生长受影响，培得过宽也会影响通气。
      后期的田间管理
    从封垅到收获为生长后期。这一阶段的特点是，茎叶生长茂盛，薯块膨大较快，田间管理重点是保护茎叶迅速生长，并创造最有利于薯块生长的条件。具体措施是：
    1、翻藤要减产：茎叶封垅以后除治虫、培土外，一般不再翻藤，也不再提藤，因为翻动藤子就会使它们受到损伤，影响产量。
    华东农业科学研究所在南京做两年试验结果。翻藤的比不翻藤的减产13.6％—16.8％。山东农业科学研究所在济南试验，还证明提藤两次比不提不翻的减产6.13％。华北农业科学研究所、安徽农业试验站、淮阴农业试验站等处做的试验，也都一致证明翻藤减产。
    在多雨情况下不翻藤子行不行呢？1958年宿迁县是多雨的年份，甘薯研究所以胜利百号为材料作试验，证明翻藤的比不翻藤的减产27.2％，试验中还证明提藤或搭架也都比不翻藤的减产。
    还有人怀疑，不翻藤子藤子上结小甘薯怎么办呢？我们认为，产量除决定于薯块大小外，还决定于薯块数目。我们希望的是薯多薯大，因此，多长一些小甘薯并不是坏事。1956年福建漳浦和平农业社亩产一万五千斤的丰产田，由于没有翻藤子，据11月份在田间观察，藤子上长的小甘薯（以重量计）约占到五分之一，而那年漳浦县的年雨量在一千三百公厘以上。这又说明在多雨情况下，也可以不翻藤子。一般主张翻藤的人，认为藤子上的根会消耗养分。事实上这种根同样能吸收水分和养料，它们不是消费器官，而是“生产者”。从生物进化观点看，甘薯藤子着地生根的习性是自然选择的结果，这种习性对甘薯植株的生长是有益的。
    我们主张不翻藤，还因为翻动时会损伤一部分茎叶。茎叶是制造养分的器官，受了损伤，植株的合成能力就被削弱。从农业经济的角度看，翻藤子是要花费劳动力的，所以即使翻藤子和不翻藤子产量一样高，不翻藤子也是合算的，何况翻藤子还会造成减产呢！
    2、剪藤子会减产：有些地方为着防病或解决缺苗问题，有时从大田中剪藤子，这是一种不得已的办法，但有一种不正确的看法，以为剪藤子是增产措施，因此主张在大田中大量剪藤子。我们用胜利百号试验结果，证明剪的愈多，薯块减产愈严重。（见附表）
    洋北公社用九州七号品种观察，小店公社用胜利百号为材料观察，甘薯都减产了。
    这些结果一致说明，藤叶是制造养分的器官，应该很好保护它。
    3、加强排灌：7、8月份正是薯块膨大时期，雨水过多，会使垅土过湿或造成涝灾。前面说过，甘薯的薯块需要充足的空气，垅土过湿就会减少土壤中的空气，薯块就长得慢，甚至于会发生腐烂现象。所以在多雨季节，排水工作是非常重要的。1958年有的地方按地形做成“十字”“田字”“围字”等形的排水沟，收到良好效果。很多局部发生腐烂的薯块，排水后又恢复生长。1958年实践还证明，在田边做横垅（与其他垅子垂直）对排水是不利的。
    4、追施肥料：藤叶封垅以后可开沟追施一次草木灰，每亩三到五百斤；隔半月到一月再追施一次。8月下旬到9月份（甘薯生长末期），可喷1％过磷酸钙液二、三次；并交错喷射13％草木灰水二、三次，这样能加强叶内同化物质的转运，提高块根产量。
        防治虫害问题
    甘薯生长期间，经常受到各种虫害的威胁，从栽插以后，地下害虫（包括地老虎，蝼蛄、蛴螬、金针虫等）就陆续发生，为害薯苗；薯块形成后，又继续食害薯块，造成减产并引起腐烂。防治地下害虫宜在栽插前进行，每亩施用0.5％666药粉六斤与一千斤细土，混合均匀，撒施在垅土内；同时用6％666粉二两，加豆饼三斤制成毒谷，在栽插前撒施在垅表土内，或在栽苗后结合锄地将毒谷施下，都能收到一定的效果。在地老虎为害严重的地方，还可用毒饵诱杀，人工捕杀。
    1958年斜纹夜蛾为害很凶，从6月份直到9月份都有发生，尤以8月份为害最严重，甘薯叶子被吃得千孔百洞，特别是靠近村庄的，早栽的和生长好的甘薯田受害尤其严重。防治斜纹夜蛾必须掌握“治小、治早、治了”的原则，在7月中、下旬幼虫发生时，在发生地区喷一次5％223粉，每亩三斤。以后再注意重点防治，可以解决问题。我们曾作了一个药液治虫效果试验，在斜纹夜蛾二龄时喷射5％223粉，杀虫率达100％；喷6％可湿性666二百倍液，1605四千倍液或223乳液一斤加605一两混合后，兑水五百斤，杀虫率都达90％以上。但当幼虫达到五龄时，杀虫率仅有50％左右。其他如卷叶虫，甘薯天蛾等，治法同斜纹夜蛾。
    南方地区的甘薯象鼻虫，对甘薯的为害也很严重，以往广东调查为害率在10％—20％以上。薯块被蛀食后，钻成伤口或孔道，发生所谓臭薯现象。象鼻虫也为害幼苗，成虫食取茎叶，严重影响生长，常使薯苗变质，重者甚至使植株死亡。田间防治这种虫时可用甘薯薯块拌666药粉，撒在地内，进行诱杀。在薯块肥大以后，应及时培土，不使甘薯露出土表，以减免害虫侵染。
