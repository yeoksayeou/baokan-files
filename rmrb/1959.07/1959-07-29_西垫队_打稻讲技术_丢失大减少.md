    West Dian Team
    Emphasizing Technique in Rice Threshing Reduces Losses Significantly

    (Our report) This paper reports that the West Dian Production Team of the West Dian Commune in Xiangshan County, Zhejiang Province, adopted measures such as holding exhibitions and on-site skill competitions, fully mobilizing the masses to achieve careful threshing and harvesting during the summer harvest.

    Before the early rice harvest, the production team strengthened ideological education among its members by publicly exhibiting physical objects and pictures from meticulous threshing and harvesting. At the same time, on-site rice threshing competitions were held to improve the threshing skills of the members.

    The exhibition hall of meticulous threshing and harvesting showcased sixty-eight exhibits of physical objects and pictures. In addition to showcasing the scene of this year's bumper early rice harvest and the early rice pre-distribution accounting, the exhibition focused on illustrating the importance of doing a good job in meticulous early rice threshing and harvesting. The pictures traced the events before spring plowing, such as ice breaking for irrigation, water conservancy construction, finding fertilizer sources by all possible means, and rush transplanting, explaining that the harvest was hard-won and inspiring people to cherish the fruits of the harvest and be sure to thresh and harvest meticulously. The comparison between two bundles of rice straw, one threshed cleanly and the other not, was particularly eye-catching. The explanation next to the rice straw pointed out that if the threshing is not clean, it is easy to waste 25 jin of rice per mu. Based on this calculation, the entire team would waste 10,625 jin, enough to feed 22 members for a year. In less than three days, more than 300 members of the team visited the exhibition.

    The team also summarized the experience of meticulous threshing and harvesting through on-site rice threshing competitions. In the rice threshing competition at noon on July 17, everyone agreed that team member Zheng Xingtu threshed the rice quickly and well, with little waste, leaving only a few grains of rice on each bundle; while the rice threshed by young team member Pan Yinbiao left forty to fifty grains on each bundle. The production team cadres summarized Zheng Xingtu's operational experience in rice threshing:

      (1) When the rice bundle is struck downward, the two thumbs should be separated and pressed on the rice stalks, so that the rice bundle is spread out flat into a "fan" shape, which makes it easier for the rice grains to fall. (See Figure 1)

    (2) When the rice bundle is struck downward, it should be immediately pushed forward so that the grains do not jump out of the barrel.

    (3) When striking the first three times, strike lightly and press hard, because the rice ears are plump, easy to fall, and easy to jump. Therefore, when striking the first three times, strike low and press hard. This way, even if there are grains left over, it will not be easy to lose them when threshing again.

    (4) The rice bundle should be flipped in the air. Generally, team members flip the rice bundle on the rice bed, which makes it difficult for the grains to fall into the barrel and easily brings out the grains inside the barrel. When the rice bundle is lifted away from the rice bed and flipped in the air to strike downwards, it is best to strike diagonally with the rice roots facing up and the rice heads facing down, rather than striking flat, which also makes it easier for the grains to fall into the barrel. (See Figure 2)

      (5) When threshing rice, if you encounter a rice bundle with uneven rice roots, push and press it on your abdomen to even it out before threshing. (See Figure 3)

    After the production team summarized and promoted this advanced operational experience, a high tide of "learning from Xingtu and catching up with Xingtu" was quickly set off throughout the team.

    At present, the production team has harvested more than 60 mu of early rice. According to on-site inspections, there are few grains left on the rice stalks and few grains are lost on the ground, and the losses have been greatly reduced compared with the past. (Attached pictures)

### 西垫队  打稻讲技术　丢失大减少

    西垫队
    打稻讲技术　丢失大减少
    本报讯　浙江象山县西垫公社西垫生产队采取开展览会、现场比巧，充分发动群众，在夏收中做到了细打细收。
    这个生产队在早稻收割以前，一面运用精打细收中的实物和图片公开展览，加强社员的思想教育；一面在现场举行打稻比巧，提高社员打稻技术。
    在精打细收、颗粒归仓的展览馆里展出了实物、图片六十八件。展览图片实物除了展示今年早稻大丰收的景象和早稻预分账外，着重说明，做好早稻精打细收的重要意义。图片追述了春耕以前敲冰灌溉、兴修水利、千方百计找肥源、突击插秧等等事迹，说明丰收来之不易启发人们珍视丰收果实，一定要精打细收。两束打得干净和不干净的稻草的对比特别引人注意。稻草旁的说明指出，如果打不干净，每亩浪费二十五斤稻谷是很容易的，以此推算，全队就要浪费一万零六百二十五斤，可供二十二个社员吃一年。不到三天，全队有三百多个社员参观了展览。
    这个队还通过现场打稻比巧，总结精打细收的经验。在7月17日中午打稻比巧中，大家一致认为社员郑兴土，稻打得又快又好，浪费也少，每束稻只留下几粒谷；而青年社员潘银标打过的稻，每束却留着四几十粒谷。生产队干部总结了郑兴土的打稻操作经验：
      （一）当稻束向下打时，两个大拇指要分开压在稻秆上，使稻束平铺散开成“扇面”的形状，这样容易使稻谷下落。（见图一）
    （二）当稻束下打时，立即向前一送，这样谷粒不致向桶外跳。
    （三）打好头三下，因为稻穗谷粒丰满、易落易跳。因此在打头三下时，要低打重压。这样即使有谷剩下来，再打也就不易损失。
    （四）稻束要悬空翻。一般社员翻稻束，是放在稻床上翻的，这样谷粒不易下桶，还容易带出桶内的谷子。在稻束离开稻床、悬空翻转向下打时，最好稻根朝上、稻头朝下斜打，不要平打，这样谷粒也容易下桶。（见图二）
      （五）打稻时，碰到稻根不整齐的稻束，要在腹部推压一下，齐了再打。（见图三）
    生产队总结和推广了这一先进操作经验后，全队很快掀起了一个
  “学兴土、赶兴土”的高潮。
    目前，这个生产队已收六十多亩早稻，据现场检查，稻秆留粒少，地上脱粒少，损失比过去大大减少。（附图片）
