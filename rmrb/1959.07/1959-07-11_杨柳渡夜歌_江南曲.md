    Yangliu Ferry Night Song
    ——A Jiangnan Tune

    The moon is three poles high, the river water resembles flowing mist, the willow trees are dark at Yangliu Ferry, on the long embankment, the grain transport team is twisted into a single rope, taking small steps, scattering the moonlight. Thousands upon thousands of grain loads converge on the riverbank, the sound of waves, laughter, and drums blend into one, startling the roosting birds in the branches, who flutter and soar into the clear, boundless moonlit sky. The old ferryman is busy and delighted, his golden bamboo pole directly touching the river, if it weren't for the new grain weighing the boat down, he would wish he could pole it all the way to the other side. Although the ferryboat flies back and forth like a shuttle, it is difficult to weave the people's deep feelings completely: Look, the grain loads at the front have already entered the city, and behind them still wind a thousand layers of mountains...

    杨柳渡夜歌
    ——江南曲
    严阵月三竿，江水似流烟，杨柳渡头杨柳暗，长堤上，送粮队拧成一股绳，碎步儿，把月色踏乱。千付万付粮担汇集在江边，涛声笑声锣鼓声响作一团，惊起了枝头的宿鸟，?啦啦，飞上万里明月天。忙煞了喜煞了摆渡老汉，金色的竹篙在江里直点，要不是新粮压得船儿偏，他恨不能一篙撑到江对岸。尽管渡船似梭来回飞，却难把人民的情意织完：看，前头的粮担已经进了城，后面还绕着千层山……
