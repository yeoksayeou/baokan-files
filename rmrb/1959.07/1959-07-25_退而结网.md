    "Retreat and Weave a Net"
    Gǎn Fēng
    On Sunday, I visited several friends, and we inevitably talked about the issue of reading. When we asked each other about our progress, none of us had really been reading seriously. We spent two days fishing and three days drying nets. We were still talking about the same things we had discussed two or three months ago: how to squeeze out time for reading, whether it's better to read in depth or to read widely, whether to study economics or philosophy, whether "opening a book is beneficial" or to study systematically with a focus... and so on. Why are we still talking about the same things after two months, and unable to bring up new topics? The reason is simple: we haven't been reading seriously, haven't delved into the books. "Envy by the pond is not as good as retreating and weaving a net." I think the most important issue at present is to go home and read! Just talking about reading without actually reading will turn us "half-baked scholars" into "empty talkers" about reading. I hope that when we meet next time, we can happily discuss what we have actually read.
    So, does this mean we shouldn't pay attention to reading methods? That's not what I mean. To learn to swim, you have to jump into the water; don't waste time endlessly researching swimming methods on the shore. Reading is the same. To study how to read well, you must first work hard and read diligently.

    “退而结网”
    敢峰
    星期天，到几个朋友家串门，不免又谈到读书问题。彼此一问情况，谁也还没有真正认真读书，两天打鱼，三天晒网，谈的无非还是两三个月以前谈过的话，什么挤时间读书，读书是精一点好还是广一点好，是学经济学还是学哲学，是“开卷有益”还是有系统有重点的学……等等。事隔两月，为什么谈来谈去还是这些，而提不出新的话题来呢？原因很简单，就是还没有认真读书，没有钻到书里面去。“临渊羡鱼不如退而结网”，我看，目前最重要的问题还是回家读书吧，光泛谈读书而不读书，会使得我们这些“半瓶醋”，变成读书的“清谈家”。愿我们下次见面时，能愉快地谈谈自己究竟读了一些什么。
    那么，是不是不要讲究读书方法呢？不是这个意思。要学会游泳，就要跳到水里面去，不要把时间花费在岸上无休止的研究游泳方法上。读书也是一样。要研究书如何读得好，首先要脚踏实地去苦读一番。
