    Eradicate Weeds from the Fields

    This year's spring and summer crops were sown in a timely manner with relatively abundant base fertilizer. Currently, they are generally growing vigorously. The main task now is to concentrate efforts and effectively carry out field management. Eliminating weeds from the fields is a very important task in the current field management of major autumn crops.

    To make crops grow strong, they must be supplied with nutrients. If there are many weeds in the field, many nutrients will be taken away by the weeds, which will affect the normal growth of the crops.

    To eliminate weeds in the fields, you must start early to achieve great results. Currently, double-cropping rice in the south is being raised, and barnyard grass is concentrated; summer crops in the north have just emerged, and the weeds are still small. Seize the opportunity to do a good job of weeding barnyard grass in rice paddies and early weeding of summer crops, which is both labor-saving and thorough, with half the effort yielding twice the results.

    Weeds have extremely strong vitality and must be repeatedly and carefully hoeed. Only by hoeing thoroughly can the purpose of eliminating weeds be achieved. Recently, individual areas have reported that the first hoeing was not completed. Weeds reappeared in the hoeed land. This shows that weeding requires special attention to improve quality; it also shows that weeding must be repeated. Especially this year, the planting density of various major autumn crops has generally increased compared to the past, so the quality requirements for inter-row hoeing and weeding must be correspondingly improved. For summer crops, especially some stubble-sown land, deep inter-row cultivation should be carried out as early as possible, which can not only thoroughly remove weeds, but also loosen the topsoil, increase soil air, and promote crop growth and development.

    Inter-row hoeing and weeding are not isolated; they must be closely combined with topdressing, irrigation, soil consolidation, and pest and disease control. This can exert a mutually promoting effect, and increased production is more guaranteed.

    Eliminating weeds has strict timeliness; it must be timely and frequent. Now is the tense stage of field management for major autumn crops. People's communes in various places must seize the opportunity, organize forces, eradicate all weeds in the fields, ensure normal crop growth, and strive for a greater autumn harvest.

    把田间杂草消灭干净
    今年的春播和夏播作物种的适时，基肥比较多，目前普遍生长茁壮，当前的主要问题是集中力量，切实作好田间管理工作。而消灭田间杂草，又是当前大秋作物田间管理中一个十分重要的任务。
    要使农作物长的壮，就要供给它养料。如果田里杂草多，许多养料就被杂草夺走了，就会影响作物的正常生长。
    消灭田间杂草，一定要早动手，收效才大。目前南方双季稻正在育苗，稗草集中；北方夏播作物出苗不久，杂草还小。抓紧时机，作好秧田除稗、夏播作物的早期锄草，既省工，又彻底，事半功倍。
    杂草生命力极强，必须反复地、细致地锄。锄得彻底，才能达到消灭杂草的目的。最近有个别地区反映：头遍没有锄完。锄过的地又出现了草荒。这说明锄草需要特别注意提高质量；同时也说明必须反复锄草。特别是今年，各种大秋作物的密植程度比过去普遍增加，因此对于中耕锄草要求的质量也就必须相应提高。对于夏播作物，特别是部分坂茬播种地，更应及早进行行间深中耕，这样不但可以把草锄得彻底，还可以疏松表土，增加土壤空气，促进作物生长发育。
    中耕锄草不是孤立的，必须与追肥、灌水、培土和防治病虫等紧密结合。这样作可以发挥互相促进的作用，增产更有保障。
    消灭杂草有严格的时间性，既要适时，又要经常。现在正是大秋作物田间管理工作的紧张阶段，各地人民公社要抓紧时机，组织力量，把一切田间杂草消灭干净，保证作物正常生长，争取秋季更大丰收。
