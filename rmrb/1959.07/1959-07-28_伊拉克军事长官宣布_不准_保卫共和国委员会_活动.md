Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, July 26th: Iraqi Military Governor Muhammad Abdi stated in a broadcast on Baghdad Radio on the evening of the 24th that the government has not yet permitted the existence of the Committee to Defend the Republic. Therefore, anyone using this name or intimidating officials and staff will be punished according to the law.

The announcement stated, "Every person and every official in the country should serve the eternal republic within the scope of their duties, and from now on, no interference in the duties of other officials and staff is allowed."

"People's Unity Daily" published a commentary on the 26th saying, "The Committee to Defend the Republic was established according to the wishes of the majority of civil servants. They hope to organize themselves to contribute the greatest strength in defending the young republic and supporting the revolutionary government." The commentary said, "These committees have been active for several months and have made satisfactory contributions to the republic."

The newspaper said, "Since the government has not yet approved these committees, we hope that civil servants will be allowed to organize professional groups, such as trade unions. Undoubtedly, the establishment of such organizations in accordance with the prescribed form and purpose will not only help civil servants improve their living standards and professional skills, but also help the government inspect the work of various departments of the state and consolidate its unity with the entire people."

    伊拉克军事长官宣布
    不准“保卫共和国委员会”活动
    新华社巴格达26日电　伊拉克军事长官穆罕默德·阿卜迪24日晚间在巴格达电台广播的通告中说，到目前为止，政府还没有允许保卫共和国委员会存在，因此，凡是使用这个名字或者威吓官员和工作人员的人，将依法予以惩罚。
    通告说，“国家的每一个人和每一个官员都应当在他们的职责范围以内为永恒的共和国服务，从现在开始不干预其他官员和工作人员的职责。”
    “人民团结报”在26日发表评论说，“保卫共和国委员会是根据担任公务员的大部分人的愿望而成立的。他们希望把自己组织起来，以便在保卫年青的共和国和支持革命政府方面贡献出最大的力量。”评论说，“这些委员会已经活动了几个月，对共和国作出了令人满意的贡献。”
    这家报纸说，“由于政府还没有批准这些委员会，我们希望，公务员将被允许组织职业团体，例如工会组织。无疑，按规定的形式和宗旨成立这种组织，不仅将有助于公务员提高自己的生活水平和业务水平，而且还有助于政府检查国家各工作部门的工作和巩固它同全体人民的团结”。
