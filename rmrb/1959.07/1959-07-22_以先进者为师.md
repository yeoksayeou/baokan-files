    Taking the Advanced as Our Teacher
    Tian Qing
    The news that the Tianfeng Brigade humbly learned from others, changed its backwardness, and achieved a bumper harvest of early rice is both inspiring and thought-provoking. What is inspiring is that the Tianfeng Brigade has transformed from a backward production team into an advanced one. What is thought-provoking is the correct attitude of the cadres and masses of the Tianfeng Brigade towards backwardness.
    In last year's production competition, the Tianfeng Brigade lost to the Nanfeng Brigade and even presented them with a large red banner saying "Take the Advanced as Our Teacher." Losing and falling behind was indeed unpleasant; however, they were enlightened and learned a lesson from it: "This time we must honestly learn from others," "Having recognized a master, we must seriously learn from the master." Moreover, they were full of confidence in turning backwardness into advancement.
    Failure and backwardness are not terrible in themselves; what is terrible is that after failure and backwardness, one does not know the reasons for failure and backwardness, nor does one learn from them. If one knows the reasons and accepts the lessons, failure can be turned into the mother of success. Whether one can find the reasons and accept the lessons depends on whether one can adopt a correct attitude towards failure and backwardness.
    Regarding the attitude towards backwardness and failure, some become discouraged, pessimistic, and disappointed after a single defeat; others acknowledge failure and backwardness, but are not discouraged, but honestly take the victors as their teachers, humbly seek advice, and make persistent efforts. The Tianfeng Brigade adopted the correct attitude. They honestly took the victors as their teachers, earnestly learned the advantages of the advanced, and sincerely accepted their advanced experience; they calmly analyzed and examined the reasons for their own backwardness and accepted the lessons of failure. Finding the reasons and accepting the lessons allows one to more humbly learn from others' strengths to make up for one's own shortcomings, and it becomes possible to turn backwardness into advancement. However, to turn this possibility into reality, besides humility, one also needs ambition. Ambition can motivate oneself to learn diligently and conscientiously, not being satisfied with learning just a little, but continuing to learn constantly. Constant learning leads to constant progress; diligence and conscientiousness enable one to learn well and learn thoroughly. Constant progress, combined with excellence, will transform backwardness into advancement. The fact that the Tianfeng Brigade's per-mu yield and total output of early rice doubled this year vividly proves this truth.
    All backward production communes and brigades should be inspired and encouraged by the experience of the Tianfeng Brigade, resolve to take the advanced as their teachers, learn humbly, learn assiduously, and learn in a manner that is appropriate to the time, place, and conditions. Eventually, they will transform backwardness into advancement.

    以先进者为师
    天青
    田丰大队虚心学习，改变落后面貌，早稻大丰收的消息，读后令人振奋，发人深省。令人振奋的是，田丰大队由生产落后队变成了生产先进队；发人深省的是，田丰大队的干部和群众对待落后的正确态度。
    田丰大队在去年的生产竞赛中，输给了南丰大队，并且还送了一面“拜先进为师”的大红旗给人家。输了，落后了，确实有些不愉快；但是，他们却从中受到了启发，得到了教训：“这回可要老老实实向人家学习了”，“拜了师傅，就要认真向师傅学习”。而且，他们还满怀信心地要变落后为先进。
    失败、落后本身并不可怕，可怕的是落后和失败以后，不知道失败、落后的原因，不知道从中接受教训。知道了原因，接受了教训，失败就可以变为成功之母。能不能找出原因、接受教训，又在于能不能对失败、落后采取正确的态度。
    对待落后、失败的态度，有一败就灰心丧气、悲观失望的；也有承认失败和落后，但并不气馁，而是老老实实以胜者为师，虚心求教，再接再厉的。田丰大队采取了正确的态度。他们老老实实以胜者为师，认真地学习先进者的优点，心悦诚服地接受人家的先进经验；冷静地分析、检查自己落后的原因，接受失败的教训。找出了原因，接受了教训，就能够更虚心学习人家的长处，来弥补自己的短处，就有可能变落后为先进。但是，要把这种可能性变为现实，除了虚心以外，还需要有志气。有志气，就可以激励自己兢兢业业地学，勤勤恳恳地学，不是学一点就满足，而是继续不断地学。不断地学，就能不断地进步；兢兢业业、勤勤恳恳，就能学得好、学得精。不断进步、又精又好，落后也会变为先进。田丰大队今年早稻亩产量和总产量跃增一倍的事实，生动地证明了这个真理。
    一切生产落后的社、队，都应该从田丰大队的事实中得到启发，受到鼓舞，下定决心以先进为师，虚心学习，刻苦学习，因时因地制宜地学习，终久是会变落后为先进的。
