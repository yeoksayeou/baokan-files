    "On the Transition of the World Socialist System to Communism"
    The Soviet journal "Kommunist" (Communist) issue No. 5, published an article co-authored by Fedoseyev and Pospelov entitled "On the Transition of the World Socialist System to Communism." The main points of the article are as follows:
    I. The countries of the socialist camp are currently at different stages of advancing towards communism. The Soviet Union has entered a new period of comprehensively developing communist construction. Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia have already established the foundations of socialism. They have achieved decisive successes in establishing the material and technical base of socialism and are currently completing the task of socialist construction. Romania, after completing the Six-Year Plan (1960-1965), will roughly complete socialist construction and enter a new stage of building socialism. Poland, in the next seven years, will take a new and giant step towards socialism. Although some countries have completed the transformation in terms of ownership and established socialist relations of production, they have not yet established the material and technical base of socialism. For example, China was an extremely economically backward country in the past, but now, on the basis of socialist relations of production, its productive forces have developed rapidly. The Chinese Communist Party, estimating the possibility of accelerating socialist construction, has decided to transform China into a socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in fifteen to twenty years, or a slightly longer period. During this period, productive forces will be raised to the level required by socialist relations of production. This will mean the complete establishment of a new socialist mode of production.
    II. Although the countries of the socialist camp are currently at different stages of development, this does not contradict the argument that socialist countries will transition to communism at roughly the same time. "Roughly the same time" should not be understood as transitioning on the same day. Although the development levels of socialist countries are rapidly approaching equilibrium, absolute balanced development is impossible. The theory of roughly simultaneous transition reflects a major trend. Within the world socialist system, it is impossible for some countries to develop unswervingly forward while others stand still. At the same time, there is no need for countries that are ahead to stop at a certain stage to accommodate some countries that embarked on the socialist road later. A general surge is emerging throughout the socialist camp. Because the relatively backward countries receive assistance from advanced countries and utilize the experience of advanced countries, they can develop faster and move forward faster than the entire socialist camp, thereby gradually balancing their levels.
    III. The advancement of socialist countries towards communism on the same front is premised on the development and consolidation of their common economic base. With the advancement towards socialism and communism, countries establish a common material and technical base and a unified form of production relations. With the victory of communism, national borders will disappear, and a unified world communist economic system will be established. The objective conditions for achieving all this are: (1) The high level of the socialist material and technical base, arming all sectors of the national economy with the latest scientific and technological achievements. (2) Further growth of the social forces building communism, the complete elimination of the remnants of the exploiting classes, further development of democracy, and the continuous improvement of the leading role of the Communist Party. (3) Extensive cooperation and mutual assistance among socialist countries, implementing international division of labor, specialization, and collaboration.
    "The Socialist Principle of Distribution According to Labor"
    The Soviet "Pravda" published an article by Tsagolov, Doctor of Economics, on May 6, entitled "The Socialist Principle of Distribution According to Labor," criticizing egalitarianism in wage policy.
    The article focuses on elucidating the fundamental difference between the proletarian view of equality and the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois views of equality, and on elaborating the importance of the socialist principle of distribution according to labor. The article points out that there is a profound distinction between the vestiges of bourgeois rights and bourgeois rights in socialist society. Bourgeois rights are built on the basis of private ownership of the means of production, while socialism abolishes private ownership of the means of production and establishes public ownership of the means of production. When discussing the issue of distribution, the article emphasizes the role of material incentives, believing that the high development of production in socialist society requires a large number of skilled personnel who master production technology. When labor has not yet become the primary need in people's lives, it is necessary to use material means to stimulate people to work better, improve labor productivity, and create more products.
    The article focuses on opposing egalitarianism, believing that egalitarianism plays a very harmful role in the development of production and that egalitarianism and socialist equality are completely different. Neglecting the wage differences between skilled and unskilled labor, and between mental and physical labor, may lead to a decline in the proportion of skilled cadres, and even a reduction in their absolute number. This will affect the economic competition between socialism and capitalism, as well as the possibility of a victorious transition to communism. The article points out that the huge increase in the number of skilled cadres in the Soviet Union is inseparable from its wage policy. The wage scale system is one of the important levers for socialist workers to improve their cultural and technical level. The article believes that abandoning the wage scale system can disrupt the social labor distribution system and expose a shortage of labor, especially in the mining industry and remote or sparsely populated areas.
    The final part of the article describes the implementation of the principle of distribution according to labor in the Soviet Union since its founding, pointing out that the Soviet wage policy has always been fighting against petty-bourgeois egalitarian tendencies. The article traces back to the period of military communism and the transition to the New Economic Policy, when Lenin launched a struggle against "leftist" egalitarian tendencies. Egalitarianism once developed to some extent in the Soviet Union during the New Economic Policy, and egalitarianism existed in the wages of industrial sectors. In the early days of the large-scale collectivization movement in agriculture, the petty-bourgeois tendency of the supply system was popular, and these were corrected in a timely manner.
    The article also mentions that the Soviet Union is currently adjusting wages and gradually narrowing the gap between wages. In recent years, the Soviet Union has gradually increased low-end wages, with an average increase of 33%. During the Seven-Year Plan, low-end wages will increase from 270 to 350 rubles per month to 500 to 600 rubles. However, this has nothing in common with petty-bourgeois egalitarianism. Narrowing the wage gap is not only to eliminate individual shortcomings in the current wage system, but more importantly, it also reflects the improvement of the cultural and technical level of the Soviet working people, as well as the gradual elimination of the essential difference between mental and physical labor in the process of communist construction.

    国外学术论文摘要
  “论世界社会主义体系向共产主义的过渡”
    苏联“共产党人”杂志第五期，发表了费多塞耶夫和波米洛夫合写的一篇文章，题目是“论世界社会主义体系向共产主义的过渡”。文章的主要论点如下。
    一、目前社会主义阵营各国处于向共产主义前进的不同阶段上。苏联已进入全面开展共产主义建设的新时期。保加利亚和捷克斯洛伐克已经建立了社会主义的基础。它们在建立社会主义的物质技术基础方面取得了决定性的成就，目前正在完成社会主义建设的任务。罗马尼亚在完成六年计划
  （1960—1965）以后，将大致完成社会主义建设，而进入建成社会主义的新阶段。波兰在最近七年内，将向社会主义跨出新的巨大的一步。有些国家虽然已经在所有制方面完成了改造，确立了社会主义的生产关系，但还没有建立起社会主义的物质技术基础。例如中国在过去是一个经济上极其落后的国家，现在在社会主义生产关系的基础上，生产力有了迅速的发展。中国共产党估计到加速社会主义建设的可能性，决定在十五至二十年或者更为多一点的时间内，把中国变成一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家。在这段期间，生产力将提高到社会主义生产关系所要求的水平。这将意味着完全确立新的社会主义的生产方式。
    二、社会主义阵营各国目前虽然处于不同的发展阶段，但这与社会主义各国大致同时过渡到共产主义的论点并不矛盾。不能把大致同时过渡理解为同一天过渡。尽管社会主义各国发展水平正在迅速接近平衡，但绝对的平衡发展是不可能的。大致同时过渡的理论反映一种主要的趋向，在世界社会主义体系内，不可能某些国家一往直前地发展，而另一些国家则踏步不前；同时，也没有必要让走在前面的国家在某个阶段上停顿下来，去适应某些较晚走上社会主义道路的国家。在整个社会主义阵营内，呈现普遍高涨的情景。过去较落后的国家由于得到先进国家的援助，利用先进国家的经验，就能以比整个社会主义阵营更高的速度，更快地向前发展，从而使他们的水平逐渐平衡起来。
    三、社会主义各国在同一阵线上向共产主义前进，是以发展和巩固他们共同的经济基础为前提的。随着向社会主义、共产主义的前进，各国建立起共同的物质技术基础，出现统一的生产关系形式。随着共产主义的胜利，国界将要消失，统一的世界共产主义经济体系将确立起来。实现这一切的客观条件是：（一）社会主义物质技术基础的高度水平，用最新科学技术成就来武装国民经济的一切部门。
  （二）建设共产主义的社会力量进一步增长，剥削阶级的残余彻底消灭，民主的进一步发扬，共产党领导作用的不断提高。（三）社会主义各国广泛的合作和互助，实行国际分工、专业化和协作化。
  “社会主义按劳分配原则”
    苏联“真理报”5月6日发表了经济学博士察果洛夫写的“社会主义按劳分配原则”的论文，批判了工资政策中的平均主义问题。
    文章着重阐述了无产阶级的平等观同资产阶级、小资产阶级的平等观根本不同，阐述了社会主义按劳分配原则的重要性。文章指出，所谓社会主义社会中资产阶级式的权利残余和资产阶级式的权利实质上有着深刻的区别，资产阶级式的权利是建筑在生产资料私有制的基础上的，而社会主义则废除了生产私有制并建立了生产资料公有制。文章在谈到分配问题时，强调了物质刺激的作用，认为社会主义社会生产高度发展需要大量掌握生产技术的熟练人员。当劳动还没有成为人们生活第一需要时，那就不能不从物质上去刺激人们更好地工作，提高劳动生产率，从而创造更多的产品。
    文章着重反对了平均主义，认为平均主义对于发展生产起着十分有害的作用，平均主义和社会主义的平等是完全不同的。忽视熟练劳动和非熟练劳动，脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的工资差别，有可能会使熟练干部比重下降，甚至它的绝对数量也要缩减。这样就会影响社会主义和资本主义的经济竞赛以及胜利过渡到共产主义的可能性。文章指出苏联熟练干部数量的巨大增长是与其工资政策分不开的，工资级差制是社会主义劳动者提高文化技术水平的重要杠杆之一。文章认为，抛弃工资级差制能使社会劳动分配制度遭到破坏，就会暴露出劳动力不足，尤其是在采矿业和边远或人口稀少的地区感到劳动力的不足。
    文章最后部分叙述了苏联建国以来贯彻按劳分配原则的情况，指出苏联的工资政策一直是在和小资产阶级平均主义倾向作斗争。文章追溯到苏联在军事共产主义以及过渡到新经济政策时期列宁就同“左”倾平均主义倾向展开了斗争。苏联在新经济政策时期平均主义曾一度有所发展，在工业部门的工资中曾存在过平均主义。在农业大规模集体化运动初期，曾流行过小资产阶级倾向的供给制思想，这些都曾及时得到纠正。
    文章还讲到，目前苏联正在调整工资，逐步缩小工资的悬殊情况。最近几年苏联对低薪工资逐步增加，平均已提高了33％。在七年计划期间低薪工资将从每月二百七十至三百五十卢布增加到五百至六百卢布。然而这同小资产阶级的平均主义是毫无共同之点的。缩小工资悬殊情况不仅是消除现行工资制度中的个别缺点，更重要的是同时也反映了苏联劳动人民文化技术水平的提高，以及脑力劳动和体力劳动本质差别在共产主义建设过程中的逐步消灭。
