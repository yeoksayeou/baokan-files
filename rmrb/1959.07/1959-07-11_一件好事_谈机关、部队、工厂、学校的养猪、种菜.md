    A Good Thing
    On Organ, Army, Factory and School Raising Pigs and Growing Vegetables

    In recent months, a very gratifying phenomenon has emerged in our organs, troops, factories, and schools: many units are raising pigs and growing vegetables, solving the problem of the increasing demand for non-staple foods by their own efforts. Although the time has not been long, great achievements have already been made. According to incomplete statistics from directly affiliated organs in six provinces and cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Sichuan, and Anhui, by the end of May, more than 190,000 pigs had been raised. Troops stationed in Beijing, Shenyang, Wuhan, Xiamen, Kunming, Nanjing, and other places have also raised more than 330,000 pigs.

    As early as fifteen years ago, in his article "On the Development of the Rent Reduction, Production, and Support the Government and Cherish the People Movement in the Base Areas," Comrade Mao Zedong called on organs, troops, and schools in the base areas to raise pigs, grow vegetables, and so on. At that time, the organs, troops, and schools in the base areas enthusiastically responded to this call, launching a vigorous production movement and establishing various production undertakings. This not only overcame the material difficulties brought about by the difficult years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, but also learned a set of skills for leading the masses in production. Now, especially after the great leap forward in agriculture last year, the material conditions are much better than during the War of Resistance Against Japan; however, people's needs for life are growing even faster. On the one hand, the supply of pork and vegetables is increasing year by year, and on the other hand, due to the development of production and construction in cities and factories, the population in urban and factory areas is also increasing rapidly, and the people's demands for life in urban and rural areas are also growing rapidly. For example, after communization and the great leap forward in production, the vast number of farmers who originally ate little meat now eat more meat; those who did not eat meat originally now eat meat. In many places, the supply of non-staple foods has greatly exceeded the quantity supplied in the same period last year. Therefore, although the production of non-staple foods has grown rapidly in recent years, it still cannot meet the growing needs of the people. Of course, the most fundamental way to solve this contradiction is to mobilize the countryside to work hard to increase the production of non-staple foods. This is being done, such as stipulating that suburban areas should focus on vegetable production, and implementing the policy of simultaneously developing public and private pig raising, and so on. However, organs, troops, factories, and schools raising pigs and growing vegetables is also one of the solutions. After the canteen of the Linkou County People's Committee in Heilongjiang Province raised pigs, it could guarantee that each person could eat more than three jin of pork per month. From August last year to mid-June this year, the canteen of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Commerce also guaranteed that each cadre eating in this canteen could eat two jin of pork per month. By doing so, the living standards of these organs, troops, factories, and schools can be rapidly improved. Organs, factories, and schools that have set up farms and livestock farms have also provided good conditions for cadres to participate in labor training. The Party Central Committee and the State Council have stipulated that in addition to a portion of cadres being sent to the countryside or factories in rotation for labor training, all staff members of each organ, factory, and school must participate in physical labor for at least one month each year. In order to ensure that each cadre can get one month to participate in physical labor, it is necessary to arrange a suitable place for these cadres to engage in physical labor, and the establishment of farms, livestock farms, pig raising, and vegetable growing by organs, factories, and schools is a relatively good place for labor. Organs, factories, and schools can arrange the time for cadres to participate in physical labor according to the needs of production and the possibility of work.

    Of course, the raising of pigs, chickens, and vegetables in our organs, troops, factories, and schools should and can only be of an amateur nature, carried out in spare time, and should not affect work, production, and study; the planting of vegetables or feed should only use barren land or other vacant land, and should not compete with the people for land. Of course, there will still be many difficulties in specific work, but the experience of many places proves that as long as the masses are mobilized to use their brains and try every possible means to find solutions, these difficulties can be overcome. Organs, factories, and schools not only have some staff members who need to participate in physical labor, but also some family members of employees who have labor power that can be utilized; on the other hand, many organs, factories, and schools located in the suburbs and near troop garrisons have a lot of barren land that can be utilized. Even those organs, factories, and schools located in the city that do not have barren land nearby can unite with organs, troops, factories, and schools that have barren land; in addition, these units also have a lot of swill and vegetable leaves that can be used as feed. Therefore, as long as these labor forces are organized, and as long as barren land and waste materials are fully utilized, a number of farms and livestock farms can be established. In a farm run by the Liaoning Petroleum No. 6 Factory, the majority of the labor force is made up of family members of the factory's employees who have labor capacity and can be separated from housework; during the production season, employees are also organized to perform voluntary labor in their spare time. The main source of labor for the Shenyang Medical College Farm is cadres sent down for training and staff members who participate in physical labor in rotation. In short, organs, troops, factories, and schools should carry out non-staple food production in accordance with the principles of increasing production and practicing economy, have an economic accounting system, and solve problems such as feed and livestock sheds by themselves, and be self-sufficient.

    From the above analysis, it can be seen that organs, troops, factories, and schools growing vegetables and raising pigs not only have economic significance, but also have political significance. Therefore, the Party committees of organs, troops, factories, and schools that have the conditions to grow vegetables and raise pigs must attach importance to this work. The reason why the directly affiliated organs, factories, and schools in Shanghai and Anhui provinces have done a good job in raising pigs and growing vegetables is that the Party committees of these units personally led this work, and other provinces and cities also have such experience. At the same time, only under the unified leadership of the Party committee can it be possible to mobilize relevant departments to assist organs, troops, factories, and schools in solving some of the difficulties in non-staple food production, such as the lack of piglets, vegetable seeds, or the lack of pig raising and vegetable growing technology, and so on. In order to ensure that organs, troops, factories, and schools raise pigs and grow vegetables well, the Party committee should also promptly organize organs, troops, factories, and schools to visit each other, exchange experiences, and even hold on-site meetings to summarize and promote the advanced experiences of advanced units in raising pigs and growing vegetables.

    We must also make it clear that those who really do not have the conditions should not be forced to raise pigs or grow vegetables. Otherwise, it will produce bad consequences. For example, if organs in urban areas insist on raising pigs in the organs, it will hinder urban hygiene, and so on.

    It is a good thing for organs, troops, factories, and schools to raise pigs and grow vegetables, and we will definitely do this well.

### 一件好事  谈机关、部队、工厂、学校的养猪、种菜

    一件好事
    谈机关、部队、工厂、学校的养猪、种菜
    最近几个月来，在我们的机关、部队、工厂和学校里出现了一种十分令人可喜的现象，这就是许多单位养猪、种菜，自己动手来解决对副食品日益增长的要求的问题。时间虽然不长，但是已经取得了很大的成就。据北京、上海、四川、安徽等六个省市的直属机关的不完全统计，到5月底，已经养猪十九万多头。驻北京、沈阳、武汉、厦门、昆明、南京等地部队，也养了三十三万多头猪。
    远在十五年前，毛泽东同志在“开展根据地的减租、生产和拥政爱民运动”一文里，就号召根据地的机关、部队、学校养猪、种菜等等。当时，根据地的机关、部队、学校热烈地响应了这个号召，展开了轰轰烈烈的大生产运动，举办了各种各样的生产事业。这样做，既克服了抗日战争艰苦年代所带来的物质困难，又学会了领导群众生产的一套本领。现在，特别在去年农业大跃进以后，物质条件比抗日战争时期的好的很多；但是人们对生活的需要增长得更快。一方面猪肉、蔬菜供应量一年年增加，另一方面由于城市、厂矿的生产和建设的发展，城市和厂矿区域的人口也迅速增加，城乡人民对生活的要求也在迅速地增长。例如广大农民在公社化和生产大跃进以后，原来吃肉少的，现在吃肉多了；原来不吃肉的，现在吃肉了。许多地方副食品的供应量，大大超过了去年同期供应的数量。因此，近几年来副食品生产虽然增长很快，但是仍是不能满足人们这种日益增长的需要。当然，解决这种矛盾最根本的办法，在于发动农村努力增加副食品生产。这一点正在做，比如规定近郊区以生产蔬菜为主，在养猪方面，实行公养私养同时并举的方针，等等。但是机关、部队、工厂、学校养猪、种菜，也是办法之一。黑龙江林口县人民委员会机关食堂养了猪以后，就可以保证每人每月吃到三斤多猪肉。青海省商业厅机关食堂，从去年8月到今年6月中旬，也保证了在这个食堂吃饭的干部每人每月吃到两斤猪肉。这样做，这些机关、部队、工厂、学校的生活水平可以迅速地提高。机关、工厂、学校，办了农场、畜牧场，还为干部参加劳动锻炼提供了良好的条件。党中央和国务院已经规定，除了一部分干部轮流下放到农村或工厂进行劳动锻炼以外，各机关、工厂、学校，全体工作人员，每人每年必须用至少一个月的时间参加体力劳动。为了使得每个干部都能得到一个月时间参加体力劳动，就要为这些干部安排一个适当的从事体力劳动的场所，而机关、工厂、学校办农场、畜牧场、养猪和种菜，正是一个比较好的劳动场所，机关、工厂、学校可以根据生产的需要和工作的可能，安排干部参加体力劳动的时间。
    当然，我们机关、部队、工厂、学校养猪、养鸡、种菜，应当也只能是业余性质，利用业余时间进行，不能影响工作、生产和学习；种菜或种饲料，只能利用荒废土地或者其他空闲土地，不能与民争地。当然，在具体工作中也还会有许多困难的，但是不少地方的经验证明，只要发动群众开动脑筋，千方百计地想办法，这些困难是可以克服的。机关、工厂、学校不仅有一部分工作人员需要参加体力劳动，而且职工家属中也有一部分劳动力可以利用；另一方面，住在郊区的机关、工厂、学校和部队驻地附近都有不少可利用的荒废的土地，就是住在城市的机关、工厂、学校附近没有荒废土地，可以同有荒废土地的机关、部队、工厂、学校联合起来；此外，这些单位还有不少泔水、菜叶，可利用作饲料。因此，只要把这些劳动力组织起来，只要把荒废土地和废物充分利用起来，就可以办起一批农场和畜牧场来。辽宁石油六厂办的一个农场中，劳动的大部分是有劳动能力而又可以脱离家务的本厂职工家属；在生产季节，再组织职工利用业余时间义务劳动。沈阳医学院农场的劳动力的主要来源，是下放锻炼的干部和轮流参加体力劳动的职员。总之，机关、部队、工厂、学校进行副食品生产，要本着增产节约的原则，要有经济核算制度，饲料、畜舍等等问题，要靠自己来解决，要自给自足。
    从上边这些分析来看，机关、部队、工厂、学校种菜、养猪，不仅有经济意义，还有政治意义。因此，凡是有条件种菜、养猪的机关、部队、工厂、学校的党委，一定要重视这一工作。上海市、安徽省等直属机关和工厂、学校养猪、种菜所以搞得好，就因为这些单位的党委亲自领导了这一工作，其他省市也有这样的经验。同时，也只有在党委统一领导之下，才有可能发动各有关部门协助机关、部队、工厂、学校解决副食品生产中一些困难，如没有小猪、菜籽，或没有养猪种菜的技术，等等。为了各机关、部队、工厂、学校养好猪、种好菜，党委还应当及时组织机关、部队、工厂、学校互相参观、交流经验，以至召开现场会议，总结和推广养猪、种菜先进单位的先进经验。
    我们也必须说清楚，实在没有条件的也不要勉强去养猪、种菜。否则，会产生不好的后果。例如在市区的机关硬要在机关内养猪，就要妨碍城市卫生等等。
    机关、部队、工厂、学校养猪、种菜，是一件好事，我们一定能把这件事情做好。
