Special "School"
　　By our reporter Wang Kongcheng

　　In the kitchen of the New Qiao Hotel in Beijing, master chefs are conducting a business test on a group of apprentices who are about to take up new jobs through meal tasting.

　　The table is set with thirty different foods such as bread, pastries, biscuits, cakes, dishes, and soups. This is the "graduation thesis" of the twenty-three apprentices. The master chefs are eating and commenting. The bread made by apprentice Lu Peiji has a correct taste without sourness, many honeycombs, great elasticity, is soft but not brittle, and has a bright yellow color. The Yuxiang shredded pork made by apprentice Yang Shimin is not only beautifully plated and evenly sliced, but also has a mellow and rich spicy flavor. They are satisfied with the apprentices' learning achievements, believing that the color, aroma, and taste of these foods are basically qualified.

　　In order to meet the needs of the increasingly developing service industry, the New Qiao Hotel began to cultivate a complete set of service personnel as early as last year. The training programs include chefs, room attendants, restaurant attendants, barbers, elevator operators, small shop salespersons, plumbers, cloakroom workers, general workers, florists, and other projects. In addition to those from Beijing, the apprentices also came from Nanjing, Xinjiang, Hebei and other places, totaling more than 180 people.

　　Under the kind and enthusiastic guidance of the veteran masters, the apprentices worked hard and made very rapid progress. Wang Dukun, a master chef in the Chinese kitchen with 30 years of experience, taught his apprentices all his skills without reservation. He told his apprentices: "I started as an apprentice at the age of thirteen, and I didn't start working at the stove until I was eighteen. At that time, the master was afraid of losing his job and didn't dare to teach me his skills. Any skills I had were learned by secretly observing. That was the old society! Now it is the new society. We are serving the people. I will teach you well, and you must learn well." Under his guidance, the apprentices can now cook six or seven hundred dishes and can basically work independently. Liu Wenhou, who has been a Chinese chef for thirty-six years, has extensive knowledge in stir-frying, quick-frying, glazing, braising, roasting, stewing, simmering, stewing, boiling, scalding, boiling, frying, cooking, pan-frying, stewing, and pot stickers. He explained all of this in detail to the apprentices. When apprentice Yang Shimin was making "Dry-Braised Prawns," he was eager to make his finished product as good as his master's, but his lack of skill made him distressed. Liu Wenhou personally helped him tirelessly at the stove, pointing out how to control the heat and how to use cooking wine. With such patient help, Yang Shimin worked hard, studied diligently, and practiced repeatedly more than 30 times, and finally made "Dry-Braised Prawns" with rich color, fresh and sweet meat, and a mellow taste.

　　In addition to interning with their masters, the apprentices learning to be room attendants often used their masters to play the role of "guests" under the guidance of the masters, and they themselves went to entertain them to improve their professional skills. On such occasions, the master who acted as the "guest" always tried every means to test and improve the apprentices' ability to work. In order to better serve customers, the apprentices actively learn about the customs, etiquette and etiquette of various ethnic groups at home and abroad. In addition, they study foreign languages ​​seriously. In the past six months, apprentice Tian Yupuo has not only learned more than 200 application English sentences, but also learned more than 100 application German sentences. Apprentice Jia Naiqian said: "Our work is an important job. It requires a lot of knowledge. If we don't study hard, we won't be able to do it well."

　　Not only the masters, but the entire hotel staff are working hard to train new apprentices. Young barber apprentices encountered difficulties in their studies: who would be their internship object if their skills were not good? At this time, the hotel employees spoke up. They said to the new apprentices, "Use us as experiments!"

　　These apprentices have now basically mastered the technology: they will soon be on the job. Everyone can't restrain the joy in their hearts. Seeing people lining up on the street to get their hair cut, apprentice Zhao Shuzhen silently muttered to them: "Don't worry, we will graduate soon, and we will be able to serve you soon!"

    特殊“学校”
    本报记者　王孔诚
    在北京新侨饭店里，厨房的大师傅们正在通过试餐，对一批将要走上新工作岗位的徒工进行业务测验。
    餐桌上放着面包、点心、饼干、蛋糕、菜、汤等三十个不同的食品。这是二十三名徒工的“毕业论文”。大师傅们一边吃着一边评论着。徒工陆培基做的面包，味正不发酸、蜂窝多、弹性大、柔而不脆、颜色黄亮。徒工杨世敏做的鱼香肉丝，不光拼盘美、刀口均匀，而且辣味柔厚。他们对徒工们的学习成绩感到满意，认为这种食品的色、香、味都基本上合格。
    为了适应日益发展的服务事业的需要，早在去年，新侨饭店就开始了培养整套服务人员的工作。培养的专业包括厨师、客房招待员、餐厅招待员、理发员、电梯司机、小卖部售货员、水暖工、衣帽间工人、杂工、花工等多种项目。来学习的徒工除北京的以外，还有从南京、新疆、河北等地来的，总数共有一百八十多人。
    在老师傅们亲切热情地教导下，徒工们努力学习，进步非常快。有着三十年工龄的中厨房大师傅王杜坤，把自己的全部技术毫无保留地教给徒弟。他给徒弟说：“我十三岁学徒，十八岁才开始上灶操作。那时师傅怕自己失业，不敢把技术教给我，有点本领都是自己偷学来的。那是旧社会啦！现在是新社会。咱们是为人民服务，我好好教你，你要好好学。”在他的教导下，现在徒弟们已会烹调六七百种菜，并且基本上可以独立工作了。作了三十六年中厨师的刘文候，在炒、爆、溜、扒、烧、烤、煨、烩、熬、氽、?、炸、烹、煎、炖、锅贴等方面有着丰富的知识。他把这一切都详尽地讲给徒工们。徒工杨世敏在作“干烧大虾”时，一心想把自己的成品作的如师傅作的那样好，可是技术的不熟又使他苦恼。刘文候就亲自在灶上不厌其烦地帮他，指给他如何掌握火候、如何使用料酒。杨世敏在这样耐心的帮助下，苦心钻研，反复练习了三十多次，终于作出了色彩穠艳，肉质鲜甜，味道醇厚的“干烧大虾”。
    学习客房招待员的徒工们，除了跟师傅一块实习外，在师傅们的指导下，还常常用师傅扮演“客人”，自己去招待的方式，来提高自己的业务水平。每逢这种场合，作“客人”的师傅总是百般设法去测验，提高徒工的工作能力。徒工们为了更好地为顾客服务，都积极学习有关国内外各民族的风俗习惯、礼貌和礼节的知识。此外，他们认真学习外语。徒工田玉璞半年来不光学会了二百多句应用英语。还学会一百多句应用德语，徒工贾乃迁说：“我们这个工作是一门重要的工作，它需要很多的知识，如果我们不努力学习，是作不好的。”
    不光是师傅们，就是整个的饭店工作人员都在为培养新的徒工而出力。年轻的理发徒工在学习中遇到了困难：技术不好谁给他们当实习的对象哪？这时，饭店的职工们开口了。他们对新徒工说，“拿我们作试验吧！”
    这些徒工们现在基本上已掌握了技术：很快就要走上工作岗位。每个人都按捺不住心里的高兴。徒工赵淑珍看到街上因理发而排队的人，自己就默默地对他们叨念：“不要急，我们马上就结业了，很快就可以为你们服务了！”（附图片）
