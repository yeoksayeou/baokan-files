Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 30th. The United States openly threatened on the 29th to end the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Meeting by a deadline. After Herter held talks with Gromyko, a spokesman for the US delegation announced that Herter had stated during the talks that he would leave Geneva on August 6th, and the Foreign Ministers' Meeting should end on the 5th, regardless of whether an agreement was reached.

The frenzy of certain forces in the United States to break up the Foreign Ministers' Meeting, which has been erupting since last week, has risen to a new peak, precisely when the East and West have just exchanged documents in Geneva on the issues under discussion, and both sides should then make serious efforts to seek an agreement. While US spokesman Burdett said that a series of busy talks would be held before Herter left Geneva, he went on to emphasize, "I certainly don't want you to portray this situation as leading to an agreement," and that the West "sees no signs of any progress" in the Foreign Ministers' Meeting.

Destructive forces are colluding and stepping up their activities to prevent the Foreign Ministers' Meeting from reaching any agreement and to prevent the holding of a summit conference. A West German spokesman clamored on the 29th that the Soviet document "in both letter and spirit" "leaves no room for agreement." French Foreign Minister Couve de Murville, who has been docilely acting as Adenauer's spokesman in Geneva, also said that the Foreign Ministers' Meeting was "not encouraging" and that "the prospect of the meeting's failure would not surprise him." When the US spokesman spoke of Herter's departure from Geneva on August 6th, he even said that the United States and the Soviet Union had "agreed" that the Geneva Conference would end on the 5th. In fact, there was no such "agreement" at all. A spokesman for the Soviet delegation said very clearly after the Gromyko-Herter talks that the foreign ministers should work seriously and not talk about issues such as adjournments.

    蓄意使外长会议破裂
    美国竟扬言限期结束会议
    据新华社日内瓦30日电　美国29日公然威胁要限期使日内瓦外长会议破裂。在赫脱同葛罗米柯举行会谈以后，美国代表团发言人宣布，赫脱在会谈中提出，他将在8月6日离开日内瓦，外长会议不论是否达成协议，应在5日结束。
    美国某些势力上周以来发作的企图破裂外长会议的狂热，进一步上升到新的顶点，而这正是东西方刚刚在日内瓦就讨论中的问题交换过文件，双方接着应该作出严肃的努力来谋求达成协议的时候。美国发言人伯丁虽然说在赫脱离开日内瓦前还将繁忙地举行一连串会谈，但是他接着就强调说：“我当然不想让你们把这种情况说成是将会取得一项协议”，西方“看不出（外长会议）有任何进展的迹象”。
    破坏势力正勾结在一起，加紧活动，来阻挠外长会议达成任何协议，阻挠召开政府首脑会议。西德发言人29日叫嚷，苏联的文件无论“在字面上和精神上”“都没有达成协议的余地”。在日内瓦一直驯服地充当阿登纳代言人的法国外长德姆维尔也表示，外长会议“并不令人鼓舞”，“会议失败的前途并不会使他感到吃惊”。美国发言人在谈到赫脱将在8月6日离开日内瓦时，竟然说美国同苏联已经“协议”日内瓦会议在5日结束。事实上，根本没有这种“协议”。苏联代表团发言人在葛罗米柯和赫脱会谈以后说得很清楚：外长们应该认真地来进行工作，而不应该又谈论什么休会等问题。
