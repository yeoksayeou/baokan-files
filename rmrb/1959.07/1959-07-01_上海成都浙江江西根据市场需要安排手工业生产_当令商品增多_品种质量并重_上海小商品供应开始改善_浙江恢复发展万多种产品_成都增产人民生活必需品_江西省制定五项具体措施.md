    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 30th – The supply of small commodities in the Shanghai market has significantly improved. Household items that were once in short supply, such as sorghum brooms, scrubbing brushes, bamboo chopsticks, wooden buckets, and pot brushes, are now basically meeting market demand. The supply and variety of other small commodities, especially seasonal goods, are also increasing daily.

    After the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee deployed measures for the production of small handicraft commodities, relevant industrial and commercial departments at the municipal and district levels immediately took action, restoring production and supply in phases according to the urgency of market demand. The famous small commodity market in the city – the Old City God Temple – also established a specialized organization to strengthen unified leadership. Recently, material supply departments and commercial units allocated a large number of waste steel, iron sheets, wood, mao bamboo, plastics, and other raw materials to support handicraft production. Among them, the wood specifically for manufacturing summer small commodities can produce more than 120,000 pieces of bathtubs, washboards, wooden clogs, etc.

    The relevant departments also organized the return of handicraft workers to their posts. A large number of Shanghai's original knife and scissor handicraft workers were transferred to factories last year to produce other products. After research by the industrial and commercial authorities, more than 40 workers in these factories have now been designated to resume the production of kitchen knives needed by residents. The Old City God Temple, New City God Temple shopping malls, and many stores have recently restored self-producing and self-selling handicraft workshops. The workshops in the Old City God Temple can now manufacture more than 70 kinds of small commodities, such as hair clips, buttons, fans, and coal briquette stoves.

    Shanghai's commercial departments are also actively striving to restore supply and sales relationships that were once interrupted with other regions and establish new cooperative relationships to increase the source of small handicraft commodities. At the recent first national exchange conference for third-category materials, Shanghai purchased handicrafts and local specialties such as carrying poles, bamboo chopsticks, and scrubbing brushes worth more than 58.8 million yuan from various regions. The supply of rush mats from Huaiyin, Jiangsu, which had been interrupted for one or two years, has also been restored. Hubei, Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi, and other places have established new cooperative relationships with Shanghai, supplying Shanghai with handicrafts such as scrubbing brushes, vegetable baskets, and brooms.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 30th – Party committees at all levels in Zhejiang Province have taken effective measures to accelerate the restoration and development of handicraft production.

    After Party committees at all levels in Zhejiang Province strengthened their leadership over handicraft production, the supply of handicraft products in the market rapidly increased. According to statistics from Ningbo, Wenzhou, Jinhua, and other regions on June 22nd, more than 10,000 kinds of handicraft products have been arranged for production and have begun to be supplied to the market, including various small farm tools, paper umbrellas, kitchen knives, chamber pots, scrubbing brushes, foot basins, rice cookers, scissors, abacuses, locks, wooden beds, wooden slippers, mirror boxes, and stationery. At the same time, the quality of many handicraft products has also improved.

    In order to strengthen the leadership over handicrafts, Zhejiang Province has further improved the Handicraft Bureau and strengthened its leadership. Many special districts, counties, and cities have also successively improved their leadership organizations and strengthened their cadres. According to preliminary statistics from 11 counties and cities including Wenling, Pingyang, Wenzhou, Hangzhou, Xiangshan, and Jinhua, more than 2,000 handicraft workers have returned to their handicraft production posts. After the return of technicians from the Zhang Xiaoquan Scissors Factory in Hangzhou, the monthly output of scissors rapidly increased from 60,000 pairs to 110,000 pairs.

    In the development of handicraft production, various places generally adopted methods such as recycling waste materials, scraps, and substitutes to solve the problem of raw materials and wood. While actively developing handicraft production, various places have also increased the number of retail stores and service points to facilitate consumers.

    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 30th – Chengdu City, Sichuan Province, is actively restoring and developing handicraft production.

    Recently, after an investigation by the Chengdu Municipal Light Industry Bureau, it has been determined that the first priority is to restore the production of more than 222 kinds of products that are closely related to the people's livelihood. Among them, the production plans for more than 60 kinds of products such as small iron parts, small hardware, wooden ware, and bamboo ware have been issued, and handicraft production units are rushing to produce them. For service industries such as sewing, bicycle repair, and various metal and bamboo and wood appliance repairs, the city added a number of service points in mid-June, which officially began operations, and organized a group of people to go through the streets and alleys to repair supplies for residents.

    While grasping the restoration of production, in addition to linking up with factories to utilize waste materials and adopt substitutes for the raw materials needed by Chengdu's handicraft industry to rapidly change its production scope, it has been decided, with the approval of the Sichuan Provincial competent department, to immediately restore the urban-rural cooperation relationship between Wenjiang, Mianyang, and six other special districts and Chengdu in terms of handicraft raw materials. In addition, the state is also prepared to give appropriate support to handicraft production in the allocation of materials.

    In order to better combine the production departments with market needs, each handicraft production unit has begun to restore contractual relationships with commercial departments in order to understand market conditions through contracts, so as to carry out production in a planned manner. At the same time, commercial departments also assist in solving the raw materials needed for handicraft production through contracts, and urge handicraft production departments to improve product quality and reduce costs.

    Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 30th – The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee recently discussed and studied the restoration and development of handicraft production at several provincial party committee meetings, and required all localities to restore the quantity, variety, and quality of handicraft products to, and surpass, the peak period in a relatively short period of time.

    The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee pointed out that the restoration and development of handicrafts is an important task at present, and Party committees at all levels should immediately take measures and earnestly grasp it. The Provincial Party Committee has determined that the following tasks should be done well at present: First, all levels should restore corresponding handicraft management agencies, handicraft cadres should return to their posts appropriately, and strengthen the leadership over handicraft production.

    Second, all localities should immediately organize forces to find out the current market needs and the past supply situation. Arrange production purposefully according to market needs.

    Third, the handicraft factories that have been converted to other industries should be appropriately restored. If it is difficult to fully restore them, a certain amount of manpower should also be drawn out and workshops should be designated to restore the original production; the handicraft workers who have been converted to other industries should be mobilized to return to their posts. The equipment and funds withdrawn from the handicraft cooperatives and factories in the past should also be returned as much as possible.

    Fourth, in terms of raw material supply, handicraft cooperatives and factories should continue to mobilize the masses, continue to carry forward the fine style of thinking of poor methods, making full use of waste materials, and finding and using substitutes; for materials under the unified control of the state, government departments at all levels should properly arrange and give appropriate satisfaction. It is necessary to further strengthen industrial and commercial cooperation and try every possible means to solve the difficulties in raw materials required for handicraft production.

    Fifth, in terms of the wages and benefits of employees, it is necessary to implement the principle of "distribution according to work, more work, more pay," and the wage system of piece rate or time quota plus bonuses can be implemented. (Attached pictures)

    上海成都浙江江西根据市场需要安排手工业生产
    当令商品增多　品种质量并重
    上海小商品供应开始改善　浙江恢复发展万多种产品
    成都增产人民生活必需品　江西省制定五项具体措施
    本报上海30日电　上海市场上小商品的供应状况已经显著改观。前些时候一度供应不足的高粱扫帚、板刷、竹筷、木桶、洗锅刷等家用杂品，基本上已满足了市场需要；其他小商品，特别是当令商品的供应量和花色品种也在日益增加。
    中共上海市委对手工业小商品的生产部署以后，市、区有关工商部门立即行动起来，根据市场需要的缓急，分期分批恢复生产和供应。全市著名的小商品市场——老城隍庙，还成立了专门机构，加强统一领导。最近，物资供应部门和商业单位拨出了大批废次钢材、铁皮、木材、毛竹、塑料等原材料，支援手工业生产。其中专供制造夏令小商品的木材，就能生产出浴盆、洗衣板、木履等十二万多件。
    有关部门还组织了手工业工人归队的工作。上海原来生产刀剪的手工业者，去年有一大部分转入工厂，生产其他产品。经过工商主管部门研究后，现在在这些厂里指定由四十多个工人恢复生产居民需要的菜刀。老城隍庙、新城隍庙商场和许多商店，最近恢复了自产自销的手工业作场。老城隍庙的作场，已能制造发夹、钮扣、扇子、煤饼炉等七十多种小商品。
    上海商业部门还积极争取与外地恢复一度中断的供销关系，建立新的协作关系，来增加手工业小商品的货源。在不久前举行的全国第一次第三类物资交流大会上，上海向各地购进了扁担、竹筷、洗帚等价值五千八百余万元的手工业品和土特产品。供销关系已经中断一、二年的江苏淮阴芦席也恢复了供应。湖北、云南、四川、广西等地与上海建立了新协作关系，供应上海板刷、菜篮、扫帚等手工业品。
    本报杭州30日电　浙江省各级党委采取有效措施，加快了手工业生产的恢复和发展。
    浙江省在各级党委加强了对手工业生产的领导以后，市场手工业产品供应量迅速增加。据宁波、温州、金华等地区6月22日的统计，已经安排生产并开始在市场供应的手工业品有各种小农具、纸伞、菜刀、马桶、板刷、脚盆、饭锅、剪刀、算盘、锁、木床、木拖鞋、镜箱、文教用品等一万多种。同时，许多手工业产品的质量也有了提高。
    为了加强对手工业的领导，浙江省已进一步健全了手工业管理局，充实了领导力量。许多专区、县、市也都相继健全了领导机构，充实了干部。据温岭、平阳、温州、杭州、象山、金华等十一个县、市的初步统计，已有二千多名手工业工人回到了手工业生产岗位。杭州市张小泉剪刀厂技工归队后，剪刀月产量从六万把迅速提高到十一万把。
    在发展手工业生产中，各地一般都采取回收利用废物料、零料、代用品等办法解决原料、木料问题。在积极发展手工业生产的同时，各地为了便利消费者，还增设了不少门市部、服务点。
    本报成都30日电　四川省成都市积极恢复和发展手工业生产。
    最近成都市轻工业局经过调查后，已经确定首先恢复生产与人民生活有密切关系的二百二十二多种产品。其中，小铁件、小五金、木器、竹器等六十多种产品的生产计划已经下达，手工业生产单位正在赶制。对于服务行业中的缝纫、自行车修理、各种金属和竹木器修配等，全市在6月中旬已增加一批服务点，正式开始营业，并且组织一批人游街串巷为居民修理用品。
    在抓紧恢复生产的同时，成都市对手工业迅速改变生产范围所需要的原材料，除和工厂挂钩利用废料和采用代用品外，经过四川省主管部门批准，已决定立即恢复温江、绵阳等六个专区在手工业原料方面与成都市的城乡协作关系。此外国家也准备在物资分配上给手工业生产以适当的支持。
    为使生产部门更好地与市场需要结合，各手工业生产单位已着手与商业部门恢复合同关系，以便通过合同了解市场情况，做到有计划地进行生产，商业部门同时也通过合同协助解决手工业生产所需要的原材料，督促手工业生产部门提高产品质量，降低成本。
    本报南昌30日电　中共江西省委最近在几次省委会议上讨论和研究了手工业生产的恢复和发展问题，要求各地在较短的时间内，将手工业产品的数量、品种和质量恢复到、并胜过以前的极盛时期。
    江西省委指出，恢复和发展手工业是当前的一项重要任务，各级党委应立即采取措施，切切实实抓起来。省委确定当前做好以下几项工作：第一，各级要恢复相应的手工业管理机构，手工业干部要适当归队，加强对手工业生产的领导。
    第二，各地要立即组织力量摸清当前市场需要，摸清过去的供应情况。根据市场需要情况，有的放矢地安排生产。
    第三，已经转业改行的手工业工厂要适当恢复，完全恢复有困难的，也应抽出一定人力，划出车间，恢复原来的生产；已经转业改行的手工业工人，要动员他们归队。过去从手工业社厂抽走的设备和资金，也应尽量调回。
    第四，在原材料供应方面，手工业社厂要继续发动群众，继续发扬想穷办法、多方利用废旧物料和寻找利用代用品的优良作风；对于国家统一掌握的物资，各级政府部门应妥善安排，适当给以满足。要进一步加强工商协作，多方设法解决手工业生产所需原材料的困难。
    第五，在职工的工资待遇方面，要贯彻执行“按劳分配，多劳多得”的原则，可以实行计件或计时定额加奖励的工资制度。（附图片）
