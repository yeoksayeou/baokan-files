    “Art is a Bridge of Friendship”
    Zhao Feng
    Uruguayan singer Virginia Castro held her first solo concert in our capital. Her emotionally charged voice seemed to transport us to the silver riverbank of beautiful Montevideo. The riverbank is like a beach, the tide rolling fine sand against the shore, and from a corner of red buildings on the shore came passionate songs... It is said that Columbus, while sailing on the endless Silver River, suddenly saw the mountain peaks that have now become the city.
    We thank her for introducing us to the works of Uruguayan composers Ergelgart and Fabini. This is the first performance of these works in our country, which is of great significance for us to understand the musical culture of the Uruguayan people. I remember the first time I heard Fabini's work was during the visit of the Chinese Art Troupe to South America in 1956, when they stayed in Uruguay. A short six-stringed (guitar) piece, was already a popular tune throughout the country – "Sad 'Capo' Song". The six-stringed guitar played the melody of folk songs and arpeggio accompaniment, making you seem to see the tall palm forest in front of you, the arpeggio accompaniment was like the wind blowing the leaves, and people were strolling in the moonlight to the tune...
    This time, I had the opportunity to hear more of Fabini's works. Each of these exquisite songs is filled with an intoxicating fragrance of folk music. I think this is the main reason why these songs are well-known among the Uruguayan people – using musical language familiar to the people to describe their lives and love.
    Virginia Castro sang these short songs with sincere emotion and profound interpretation, just like she sang the short songs of Spanish composers de Falla and Granados, showing the most valuable thing as a chamber music performer – that is, implicit and deep affection. It should be said that this is also a recognized feature of the Spanish school and Uruguayan modern composers – unfeigned enthusiasm. Our singers also well embodied this point. We know that it is not easy to not care about the prominent and gorgeous appearance of music.
    What particularly excites us is that our guest sang our Yunnan folk song "Little River Flowing" with such sincerity. No wonder there was thunderous applause in the hall of the Tianqiao Theater. This reminds me even more that in 1956, when the Chinese young singer Liu Shufang visited Uruguay with the Chinese Art Troupe, Liu Shufang's Uruguayan songs were also warmly welcomed by the Uruguayan people with the help of Virginia Castro. This inevitably reminds me of a sentence we and our Uruguayan guests said when we met in Beijing and talked about the warm hospitality the Chinese Peking Opera and acrobatics artists received in South America: "Art is a bridge of friendship." Indeed, through the concert of our Uruguayan guests, this has further strengthened the mutual understanding and friendship between the Chinese and Uruguayan people. (Attached picture)

    “艺术是友谊的桥梁”
    赵沨
    乌拉圭歌唱家比尔希尼亚·卡斯特罗在我国首都举行她的第一次独唱会，她的充满着情感的声音把我们好像又引到了美丽的蒙特维特奥的银河的河滩边上了。那像海滩一样的河滩，潮水卷着细沙扑打着河岸，岸上的一角红楼里传出了热情的歌声。……据说当年哥伦布就是在一望无际的银河航行时，突然看到了现在成为城市的山头的。
    感谢她为我们介绍了乌拉圭作曲家埃勒加尔特和法比尼的作品，这是这些作品在我国的第一次演出，这对于我们了解乌拉圭人民的音乐文化有着重要的意义。我记得我第一次听到法比尼的作品是在1956年我国艺术团访问南美在乌拉圭停留的时期，一首短小的六弦琴（吉他）的曲子，已经是一个风行全国的曲子了——“悲哀的‘卡波’曲”。六弦琴弹出了民歌风的曲调和琶音的伴奏，使你好像在眼前就看到那高高的棕榈林，琶音的伴奏就好像是风在吹拂着树叶，人们踏着曲调在月光下漫步……
    这一次有机会听到更多的法比尼的作品，这些小巧的歌曲每一首都充满着一股醉人的民间音乐的芬芳，我想，这是这些音乐其所以能够为乌拉圭人民家弦户诵的主要原因——用人民熟知的音乐语言来描写人民的生活和爱情。
    比尔希尼亚·卡斯特罗以真挚的情感和深刻的解释来演唱了这些短歌，正像她演唱西班牙作曲家德·法拉和格拉那多斯的那些短歌一样，表现了一个作为室内乐的表演者的最可贵的东西——那就是含蓄而深情。应该说这也是西班牙乐派和乌拉圭近代作曲家们被公认的特征——无伪的热情。我们的歌唱家也很好地体现了这一点，我们知道，不为去计较音乐中那些显赫的华丽的外表，这是很不容易做到的。
    使我们特别激动的是我们的客人那么真情地演唱了我国的云南民歌“小河淌水”，难怪这要在天桥剧院的大厅里爆发起雷动的掌声。这更使我想起在1956年，我国的青年歌唱家刘淑芳随我国艺术团访问乌拉圭时，正是在比尔希尼亚·卡斯特罗的帮助下，刘淑芳演唱的乌拉圭歌曲也受到乌拉圭人民的热烈的欢迎。这就不由的使我想起我们和我们的乌拉圭客人在北京相遇，谈到中国的京剧、杂技艺术家们在南美受到的热情款待时说到的一句话：“艺术是友谊的桥梁”。真的，通过我们的乌拉圭客人的音乐会，这已经进一步加强中乌两国人民的相互了解和友谊。（附图片）
