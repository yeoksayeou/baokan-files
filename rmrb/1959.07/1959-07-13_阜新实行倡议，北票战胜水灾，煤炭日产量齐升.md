Fuxin Executes Initiatives, Beipiao Conquers Floods, Daily Coal Output Rises Together
(According to the Liaoning Daily) The entire staff of the Fuxin Coal Mine continues to exert their utmost effort to actively increase coal production, ensuring the fulfillment and overfulfillment of the third-quarter production targets and economic and technical indicators, and comprehensively achieving the conditions of the competition initiatives proposed to coal mines nationwide. A large-scale bumper harvest red flag competition movement aimed at increasing production and practicing economy is being widely and deeply unfolded throughout the mining area. At the beginning of the third quarter, the entire mine's production level significantly increased, with the average daily output from July 1st to 8th increasing by more than 8,000 tons compared to the same period in June.

In order to ensure the comprehensive completion of the third-quarter production tasks, the Fuxin Mining Bureau had already convened specialized meetings on production preparation, safety production, cost reduction, and promotion of advanced experiences in June. At the same time, it examined and summarized the work of the first half of the year and comprehensively arranged the work for the third quarter. The CCP Fuxin Municipal Committee convened a high-yield, high-quality, high-efficiency, large-scale bumper harvest red flag competition broadcast rally at the end of June, further mobilizing the masses in depth and launching a new upsurge in the large-scale bumper harvest red flag competition.

Starting from July 1st, the Fuxin Mining Bureau focused on specific leadership over production and production preparation. The bureau and mine directors are all grasping production, tunneling, and stripping work by shift and day. Each mine has a deputy mine director specifically responsible for production preparation, strengthening the tunneling of main roadways and technical management, and strengthening the acceptance system to ensure roadway quality, making full preparations for coal mining. Each open-pit mine adjusted its mining and stripping machinery according to the requirements of a double harvest of coal mining and stripping, and formulated active measures. A comprehensive inspection of the maintenance of machinery and equipment was carried out, and the production of accessories was actively organized to strengthen equipment maintenance. Prepare conditions for the comprehensive and balanced completion of the third-quarter production tasks.

The Mining Bureau also organized joint inspection teams to go deep into the mines to further mobilize the masses, vigorously carry out technical innovations, vigorously promote advanced experiences, and strengthen the weak links in the mining and tunneling working faces, in order to improve the output of the working faces and achieve a large-scale bumper harvest in the overall situation. Recent continuous rainy weather has had a great impact on coal mine production, but all the workers are full of enthusiasm, actively participating in the construction of line maintenance and flood control projects while striving to produce, determined to comprehensively complete the third-quarter plan and present a gift to the 10th anniversary of the National Day.

Furthermore, the Beipiao Mining Bureau, since entering July, under the threat of continuous heavy rain and flooding, has launched a new production upsurge. On the basis of overfulfilling the production plan for the first half of the year, they are advancing victoriously, resolutely completing the third-quarter coal production plan, and presenting a gift to the 10th anniversary of the National Day.

The Beipiao mining area has recently experienced continuous rainy weather, with a large amount of rainwater pouring down from the surrounding mountains, which once flooded the mine entrances. A large amount of rainwater flowed into some mines, affecting production. However, this situation further aroused the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers. Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, they organized a flood prevention army to carry out rescue work; at the same time, they launched a competition upsurge to overfulfill the third-quarter plan and greet the tenth anniversary of National Day. At the Mining Bureau's three-level model worker conference and six-level cadre meeting, the spirit of the provincial party committee's industrial meeting was conveyed. Through extensive airing of views, debates, and the posting of big-character posters, the broad masses of workers used the method of criticism and self-criticism to examine the key issues in production, and exposed more than 400 problems in management, equipment maintenance, and other aspects. Through inspection and tapping potential, the workers, based on the spirit of combining exerting all their energy and seeking truth from facts, and after considering all aspects, decided to increase the production of coking coal by 180,000 tons this year, with a total output increase of 46% compared to last year's actual output.

Now, the threat of flooding has been basically eliminated, and some closed mine entrances and machinery have been restored to production. A new production upsurge has already begun. The average daily output of coal for the first seven days was 8,554 tons, and on the 8th it had risen to 9,710 tons, and is steadily increasing. (Attached picture)

    阜新实行倡议，北票战胜水灾，煤炭日产量齐升
    据辽宁日报消息　阜新煤矿全体职工继续鼓足干劲，积极增产煤炭，保证完成和超额完成第三季度生产任务和经济技术指标，全面实现向全国各煤矿提出的竞赛倡议条件。全矿区以增产节约为目的的大面积丰产红旗竞赛运动正在广泛深入地展开。第三季度一开头，全矿生产水平就显著上升，7月1日至8日的平均日产量比6月同期提高了八千多吨。
    为了保证全面完成第三季度生产任务，阜新矿务局早在6月份就先后召开了生产准备、安全生产、降低成本以及推广先进经验等专业会议，同时检查和总结了上半年的工作，全面安排了第三季度的工作，中共阜新市委在6月末召开了高产优质高效率大面积丰产红旗竞赛广播大会，进一步深入发动群众，掀起了大面积丰产红旗竞赛的新高潮。
    从7月1日开始，阜新矿务局抓紧了对生产和生产准备工作的具体领导。局、矿长都按班按日抓生产抓掘进剥离，各矿都有一名副矿长专门负责生产准备工作，加强了主要巷道掘进和技术管理，加强验收制度，以保证巷道质量，为采煤做好充分准备。各露天矿都根据采煤、剥离双丰收的要求，调整了采剥机械，制订了积极措施。全面检查了机械设备维修情况，积极组织配件生产，加强设备维护。为全面均衡的完成第三季度生产任务准备条件。
    矿务局还组织了联合检查组，深入各矿坑进一步发动群众，大搞技术革新，大力推广先进经验，加强采掘工作面的薄弱环节，以提高工作面的产量，实现全局大面积丰产。最近连日阴雨，对煤矿生产有很大影响，但全矿职工个个干劲冲天，一面积极参加了线路维修和防水工程的建设，一面努力生产，决心全面完成第三季度计划，向国庆十周年献礼。
    又讯　北票矿务局进入7月以来，在连日大雨、积水成灾的威胁下，掀起了新的生产高潮，在超额完成上半年生产计划的基础上，乘胜前进，坚决完成第三季度煤炭生产计划，向国庆十周年献礼。
    北票矿区最近连日阴雨，附近群山倾泻大量雨水，一时曾漫到采煤坑口，有的矿井流入大量雨水，影响了生产。但是这种情况却更加激起广大职工的革命干劲。他们在党委的统一领导下，组织了防汛大军，展开了抢险工作；同时，又掀起超额完成三季度计划、迎接国庆十周年的竞赛热潮。在矿务局召开三级标兵大会和六级干部会议上，传达了省委工业会议的精神，通过大鸣、大放、大辩论和贴大字报，广大职工用批评和自我批评的方法，对生产中的关键问题作了检查，并揭发出管理工作、设备维修等方面的问题四百多件。职工们通过检查和挖掘潜力，本着鼓足干劲和实事求是相结合的精神，在考虑到各方面的因素之后，确定今年再增产焦煤十八万吨，总产量将比去年实际产量提高46％。
    现在，水灾威胁已被基本消除，部分停产的坑口和机械都已恢复了生产。一个新的生产高潮已经掀起来了。煤炭日产量前七天平均为八千五百五十四吨，8日已上升到九千七百一十吨，正在稳步上升。（附图片）
