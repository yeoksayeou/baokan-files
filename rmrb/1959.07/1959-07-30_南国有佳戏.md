    A Fine Play in the South
    Qin Li

    The recent performance of the Cantonese opera "Guan Hanqing" in Beijing has been warmly welcomed by the Beijing audience. The beautiful acting and music make the play even more moving.

    Cantonese opera is one of the major local opera genres in Guangdong. Besides it, there are other opera genres with a large audience in the South. After seeing "Guan Hanqing," I was reminded of the Qiong opera "Red Leaves with Poems." It is also a tragedy and very moving. The so-called Qiong opera is the local opera of Hainan Island. It also came to Beijing, but unfortunately, it did not receive the attention it deserved.

    "Red Leaves with Poems" depicts the love tragedy of a young couple, who eventually commit suicide by drowning. The highlight of the play is its delicate and thorough psychological portrayal. This is due to the well-written lyrics, the good acting of the actors, and the good musical accompaniment. The rhythm of the lyrics varies, with three-character, four-character, and five-character sentences in addition to seven-character and ten-character sentences. Whether it is a monosyllabic or disyllabic word ending, it seems natural and appropriate. In addition, there are also smooth, lengthy monologues, which are not easy to achieve. The main actors are quite talented and perform very seriously. But what I like most is the music of this play.

    The music of Qiong opera is gentle and melodious, even more so than that of Cantonese opera. The volume of the orchestra is just right, sometimes only playing low-pitched huqin or muted suona. Because the music closely matches the plot and lyrics, people can fully appreciate the lyrics, which makes them even more grateful for the music. Here, the music never overwhelms the actors as in some plays—the voice of the music drowns out the singing of the actors, causing the audience's eardrums to vibrate uncomfortably. I think this is an advantage of Qiong opera and worth learning from by some other opera genres.

    From the program, I read the names of the Qiong opera singing styles, such as Bitter Tune, Sighing Board, Arguing Tune, and Ancient Tune. It is said that some of them have been newly discovered in recent years. Obviously, music workers have contributed to the reform of this local opera genre, and the "heroes" of music indeed have a great "field of use" in opera!

    南国有佳戏
    秦犁
    这次粤剧“关汉卿”来京演出，受到北京观众的热烈欢迎。优美的演技和音乐，使这个戏的效果更加动人。
    粤剧是广东的主要地方剧种之一，除了它还有其他拥有南方广大观众的剧种。看了“关汉卿”，使我想起琼剧“红叶题诗”。它也是个悲剧，也很动人。所谓琼剧，就是海南岛的地方戏，它也曾来过北京，可惜未受到应有的注意。
    “红叶题诗”描写一对青年男女的恋爱悲剧，最后二人投水牺牲。戏的突出之处是心理刻划细致透彻。这要归功于唱词写得好，演员演得好，以及音乐配合得好。唱词节奏变化多，除七字、十字句外，有三字、四字、五字句，不论单音词还是双音词结尾，好像都自然妥贴。此外，还有酣畅的大段的独白，这也是不容易的。主要演员相当有才华，演得很认真。而最使我喜爱的，是这个戏的音乐。
    琼剧的音乐柔和婉转，比之粤剧有过之无不及。乐队音量恰到好处，有时只有低音的胡琴或压低了声音的唢呐演奏。由于音乐紧密配合剧情和唱词，使人们能够充分欣赏唱词，也就更使人对音乐发生感激之情了。音乐在这里，决没有像某些戏中那样发生喧宾夺主的现象——音乐的嗓音盖过了演员的唱，使观众的耳膜震得发生一种生理上的不舒服。我认为这是琼剧的优点，值得有些剧种借鉴。
    从节目单上读到琼剧的唱腔名称，有苦腔、叹板、争辩腔、古腔等。据说，有一些是近年来新发掘出来的。显然，音乐工作者对于这个地方剧种的改革是有贡献的，而音乐的“英雄”，在戏曲方面也的确大有“用武之地”！
