Xinhua News Agency, July 22nd News: Polish Ambassador to China, Kirylok, held a grand reception this evening to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the founding of the Polish People's Republic. More than a thousand Chinese state leaders and responsible persons from various fields attended the reception, warmly celebrating the glorious achievements of the Polish people over the past fifteen years and the great victory of the socialist system together with fraternal Polish comrades.

Vice Chairman Dong Biwu attended the reception and delivered a speech (full text on page 4). He said: "1959 can be said to be a year particularly worthy of celebration for our great socialist camp. In this year, several members of our socialist family will greet the tenth or fifteenth anniversary of their birth with their own glorious achievements. This is a matter of great international significance, because this fact powerfully shows that the new socialist system will ultimately replace the decadent capitalist system."

Vice Chairman Dong Biwu concluded by warmly congratulating the greater development of friendly and cooperative relations between the governments and peoples of China and Poland in all fields, and emphasized: "In our country's economic construction and struggle to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, the Polish government and people have given us much help and support. For this, I express my heartfelt thanks on behalf of the Chinese government and people."

Among those attending tonight's grand reception were Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairmen Li Jishen and Guo Moruo, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Zeng Yongquan, responsible persons of various departments of our national organs, people's organizations, and democratic parties, as well as diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries stationed in China.

The banquet hall of the Beijing Hotel was filled with an atmosphere of boundless festive joy. The national flags and emblems of China and Poland were hung high on the flower-filled platform. Chinese and foreign guests constantly raised their glasses in the brightly lit hall, warmly congratulating the glorious festival of the Polish people and the strong unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

Ambassador Kirylok spoke first at the beginning of the reception (full text on page 4). In his speech, he introduced to the guests the glorious achievements made by the Polish people in the past fifteen years, saying: "Fifteen years after the founding of the country, People's Poland is stronger than at any time in its thousand-year history."

Speaking of Poland's foreign policy, the Ambassador said: "The Polish government and all our people resolutely oppose all conspiracies by war provocateurs who attempt to revive German militarism."

The Ambassador concluded by warmly congratulating the continuous strengthening of the eternal friendship and brotherly cooperation between the Chinese and Polish peoples, and wishing the Chinese people further achievements in their creative work of building a happy future.

After Ambassador Kirylok and Vice Chairman Dong Biwu spoke, the band played the national anthems of China and Poland respectively.

Vice Premier Chen Yi delivered a speech at the reception, wishing Ambassador Kirylok and all the comrades of the Polish Embassy good health, and thanking the Polish experts for their sincere help in our country's construction.
