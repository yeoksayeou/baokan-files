Mountain Climbing Diary

    Trampling Over Glaciers and Ten Thousand Years of Snow
    June 12, Clear weather.
    Our Chinese mixed-gender Mount Muztagata climbing team set off from Kashgar in the Pamir Plateau of western Xinjiang in a mighty formation. The team of over fifty members included four ethnic groups: Han, Tibetan, Uyghur, and Hui. We transported over 15,000 kilograms of food and equipment needed for the climb.

    Our team members are very young, with an average age of around twenty years old, the oldest being thirty-four. Their climbing history is also short, with the longest being only four years. A few of them had climbed Mount Muztagata, which is 7,546 meters above sea level, with Soviet mountaineers three years ago, and then climbed Mount Gongga in Sichuan, which is 7,590 meters above sea level. The vast majority of the others are active members who have emerged in the past two or three years with the development of our country's mountaineering cause. Some have only climbed Mount Lenin in the Soviet Union, which is 7,134 meters above sea level, and some have inspected glaciers in the Qilian Mountains of Gansu. Most of them only climbed an unnamed peak in the Nyainqêntanglha Mountains north of Lhasa in Tibet this spring, which is 6,177 meters above sea level, for high-altitude mountaineering training.

    This mountaineering activity is large in scale, and the team members come from all walks of life. Among them are forestry workers from Sichuan, as well as herders and farm workers from Lhasa; there are scientific workers and university students, as well as soldiers stationed on the frontier defending the motherland.

    This time, almost all the outstanding members of our country's mountaineering community have been gathered, but climbing Mount Muztagata in the Pamir Plateau, which is 7,546 meters above sea level, cannot be said to be an easy task.

    It is worth noting that a group of female mountaineers has also appeared in our country's mountaineering team. Women account for nearly one-third of the more than fifty members, and the one with the longest climbing history has only been climbing for a little over a year.

    In the more than one hundred years of world mountaineering history, it was not until 1955 that the Frenchwoman C. Kogan created the highest female mountaineering record. She climbed a peak of Mount Ganesh in the Himalayas from Nepal, which is 7,456 meters above sea level. Now, four years have passed, and no female mountaineer from any country has surpassed her record. And now, the high mountain that our country's female mountaineers are going to climb is much higher than the record created by C. Kogan. Undoubtedly, this will be an arduous battle, which requires not only rich mountaineering experience as guidance, but also good physical fitness and strong will from the team members.

    The car travels on the highway from Kashgar to Tashkurgan, and enters the mountainous area of the Pamir Plateau with overlapping mountains in two or three hours. It is gradually getting colder. The mountaineering team had conducted more than a month of physical training in Kashgar, where the climate was hot. Wearing a vest there still caused sweating, but now coming to the Pamir mountainous area, although the team members have put on sweaters and down jackets to keep out the cold, they still feel a bit cold!

    The highway to Tashkurgan, which opened to traffic on October 1st last year to climb the Pamir Plateau, allows cars to reach the foot of Mount Muztagata in just one day. Three years ago, the Sino-Soviet mixed mountaineering team transported materials from Kashgar, and the camels took a total of eighteen days to reach the destination.

    In Kashgar, local party and government leaders warmly received us and encouraged the mountaineers to be sure to exercise well and plant the five-star national flag on the top of Mount Muztagata. The team members also regard this as the expectation of the people of the whole country and keep it firmly in their hearts.

    The team members' morale is high, and they can't help but sing the "Mountaineer's Song":

   …We are mountaineers,
    We are high mountain warriors.
    Trampling over glaciers and ten thousand years of snow,
    We will take a stroll even in paradise.
    Comrades, come on! Dedicate your youth to the motherland.
    Tempered and forged iron men,
    Hey, let the red flag fly all over the mountain peaks.

    The singing accompanied the car speeding forward, floating in the mountainous area of the Pamir Plateau.

    Coming to the Side of the "Father of Ice Mountains"
    June 13, High Mountain Home.
    Last night, the team members camped on the upper reaches of the Gez River, more than seventy kilometers away from Mount Muztagata. This is because they started late. Originally, the journey of more than two hundred kilometers could be reached in one day, but now they have to divide it into two and a half days.

    The car bypassed the clear water and blue waves of Lake Karakul, where wild ducks flew, and arrived at the foot of the mountain west of Mount Muztagata. The sky was surrounded by gloomy clouds, pressing heavily on the foot of the tall snow mountain, making it impossible to see the original appearance of Mount Muztagata. Only a dozen silver ice rivers were exposed around the snow mountain, plunging straight down the mountain like swimming dragons.

    But no matter what, we finally arrived at our destination. This is the "Father of Ice Mountains," 7,546 meters above sea level. The local Tajik and Kyrgyz herders regard it as the embodiment of "greatness" and "sacredness" because of its unparalleled height and the fact that the snow never melts for ten thousand years. They love it, worship it, and praise it. It is located at the junction of Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County and Akto County, Kizilsu Kyrgyz Autonomous Prefecture.

    This is Mount Muztagata, which the former Swedish traveler Sven Hedin and the British mountaineer E. Shipton tried to conquer. The former did not climb to 6,800 meters even after four attempts, and the latter barely climbed to 7,000 meters, but had to retreat down the mountain because his feet were frozen by wind and snow. In 1956, however, thirty-one Sino-Soviet mountaineers collectively climbed to the summit of Mount Muztagata, creating a new world record for the largest number of people collectively climbing a high mountain above 7,500 meters and all returning safely. To this day, no mountaineering team from any country has surpassed this record.

    On the day the Chinese mixed-gender Mount Muztagata mountaineering team left Kashgar, they learned from the local meteorological station that the climate on Mount Muztagata had deteriorated in the past ten days, and until late June, there would be windy and snowy days here. Sure enough, they encountered such weather on the first day.

    The mountaineering team members arrived at Kartomark, a high ground 4,500 meters above sea level on the west side of Mount Muztagata. Here, it is tightly connected to the Kartomark and Yangbulak glaciers on both sides, and backs onto the Mount Muztagata snow mountain. Piles of moraine stones dozens of meters high, transported by the two glaciers, surround this high ground from both sides. Before the large team members arrived, the advance team, composed of Zhang Junyan, the chief of general affairs of the mountaineering team, and Liu Dayi, a sports athlete, and eight others, had already started to establish a base camp here. The radio station, kitchen, captain's office, and team members' dormitory tents have all been set up.

    This base camp is only more than ten kilometers away from the highway, and supplies and food transported from Kashgar can be quickly transported here. This high ground is relatively flat and sheltered from the wind and close to water, making it very suitable as a base camp.

    The address of this base camp is the No. 1 high mountain camp of the Sino-Soviet mixed mountaineering team in 1956. It is nearly 500 meters higher than the base camp in 1956, which can save a day's journey up and down the mountain, so that the mountaineers can directly use the reserved physical strength for mountaineering activities. At the same time, it can also enable the mountaineers to develop better high-altitude adaptability from the beginning.

    The base camp was established with the help of local Kyrgyz herders. He Jiamukai Leder, the chief of the Civil Affairs Section of the Kizilsu Kyrgyz Autonomous Prefecture, personally came here to help arrange the base camp. The herders lent the mountaineers several yurts, which are large and cold-proof. The herders also sent more than sixty horses, donkeys, and camels to transport more than 15,000 kilograms of mountaineering supplies to the base camp.

    In the evening, the temperature dropped to minus 6.5 degrees Celsius, and the water tank froze more than an inch thick, but in the cold region, the team members rested in the yurts and did not feel cold at all. Everyone was satisfied with such a good base camp, and a battle to conquer the "Father of Ice Mountains" was about to begin here. (To be continued)

　　登山日记
　　王凤桐  杨克现
    踏破冰川万年雪
    6月12日，天气晴朗。
    我们中国男、女混合慕士塔格登山队的队伍，浩浩荡荡地从新疆西部帕米尔高原的喀什出发了。五十多名队员中，包括汉、藏、维吾尔、回等四个民族，随队运送了三万多斤登山所需要的食品和装备。
    我们的队员年纪很轻，平均年龄在二十岁左右，最大的一个是三十四岁；登山历史也都很短，最长的只有四年的光景，其中少数人三年前曾经和苏联登山运动员一起，攀登过拔海七千五百四十六米的慕士塔格山峰，而后又攀登过拔海七千五百九十米的四川贡嘎山。其他绝大多数，是在近两三年来随着我国登山事业的发展涌现出的积极分子。他们有的只攀登过苏联境内拔海七千一百三十四米的列宁山峰，有的曾经在甘肃祁连山考察过冰川，而大部分人只是今年春天在西藏拉萨以北攀登过念青唐古拉山中一个拔海六千一百七十七米高的无名山峰，进行过高山登山活动的锻炼。
    这次登山活动规模很大，队员们来自各行各业。其中有四川的林业工人，也有拉萨的牧民和农场工人；有科学工作者和高等学校的学生，也有驻守边疆保卫祖国的战士。
    这次几乎是集中了我国登山界的绝大多数优秀分子，但要去攀登帕米尔高原拔海七千五百四十六米的慕士塔格雪山，总不能说是一件容易的事情。
    值得注意的是，在我国登山队伍中，还出现了一批女子登山运动员，五十多个队员中，女的占了将近三分之一，其中登山历史最长的只不过一年多。
    在世界登山运动一百多年的历史中，只是到了1955年，才有法国人克·郭刚创造了女子登山最高纪录。她曾经从尼泊尔境内登上了喜马拉雅山的一座拔海七千四百五十六米的加内什山峰。如今四年过去了，还没有任何一个国家任何一个女子登山运动员超过她的纪录。而现在，我国的女子登山运动员所要攀登的高山，比克·郭刚所创造的纪录还要高得多。无疑地，这将是一场艰苦的战斗，既需要有丰富的登山经验作指导，又需要队员有良好的体格和坚强的意志。
    汽车行驶在喀什到塔什库尔干的公路上，两三个小时便进入了群山重叠的帕米尔高原山区。渐渐有些冷了。登山队员曾经在气候炎热的喀什进行了一个多月的体能锻炼。在那里穿着背心依然淌汗，现在来到帕米尔山区，队员们虽然纷纷换上了御寒的毛衣和鸭绒衣，但还感到有点冷呢！
    去年10月1日通车到塔什库尔干攀登帕米尔高原的公路，汽车只需要一天便可以到达慕士塔格山下；而三年前，中、苏混合登山队从喀什运输物资，骆驼一共走了十八天才到达目的地。
    在喀什，当地党政领导人员曾经亲切地接待了我们，并勉励登山运动员们一定要锻炼好体格，把五星国旗插到慕士塔格山顶上。队员们也把这看做全国人民的期望，牢牢地记在心里。
    队员们情绪高涨，不禁引吭高歌，唱起了“登山运动员之歌”：
   ……我们是登山运动员，
    我们是高山战士。
    踏破冰川万年雪，
    天堂也要走一番。
    同志们，来呀！为祖国献出青春。
    千锤百炼铁打的汉，
    嘿，红旗插遍高山巅。
    歌声随着汽车疾驰前进，飘荡在帕米尔高原山区。
    来到“冰山之父”身边
    6月13日，高山安家。
    昨夜队员露宿在距离慕士塔格山七十多公里的盖孜河上游。这是因为动身迟的缘故，本来二百多公里的旅程一天就能到达，现在只好分作两个半天走。
    汽车绕过了绿水碧波、野鸭乱飞的卡拉湖畔，便到了慕士塔格西面山下。只见天空阴云缭绕，黑沉沉直压到高大的雪山脚下，看不见慕士塔格山本来的面目，只露出了雪山四周十多条银色的冰河，游龙一般直泻到山下。
    但不管怎么样，我们终于到达了目的地。这就是拔海七千五百四十六米高的“冰山之父”，当地塔吉克、柯尔克孜族牧民因为它无比高大和积雪万年亘古不化，把它当作“伟大”和“神圣”的化身，爱戴它，崇拜它，讴歌它。它刚好位于塔什库尔干塔吉克族自治县和克孜勒苏柯尔克孜自治州阿克陶县的交界处。
    这就是昔日瑞典旅行家斯文·赫定和英国登山运动员埃·希普顿企图征服它的慕士塔格山，前者四次也没有登到六千八百米的地方，后者勉勉强强登到了七千米，因为风雪严寒冻坏了脚而不得不败退下山。而到1956年，三十一名中、苏登山健儿却集体攀登上了慕士塔格山顶峰，创造了集体登上七千五百多米以上高山、人数最多又全部安全的世界新纪录，至今还没有任何一个国家的登山队超过这个纪录。
    中国男、女混合慕士塔格登山队在离开喀什的当天，曾经向当地气象台了解到：近十天内，慕士塔格山的气候恶化，直到6月下旬，这里都是多风雪的日子，果然第一天就碰到了这样的天气。
    登山队队员来到了慕士塔格山西面拔海四千五百米的高地卡尔吐马克。这里两面紧接着卡尔吐马克和洋布拉克两条冰河，背靠着慕士塔格大雪山。两条冰河运下来的几十公尺高的冰碛石堆，从两面包围着这块高地。在大队队员还没有来到之前，由登山队的总务长张俊岩、运动健将刘大义等九人组成的先遣小组，已经在这里着手建立大本营基地。电台、伙房、队长办公室和队员宿舍的帐篷，都已经搭盖起来。
    这个大本营距离公路只有二十多华里，从喀什继续运来的物资食品，很快就可以输送到这里。这个高地比较平坦，而且背风近水，非常适宜作为大本营基地。
    这个大本营的地址是1956年中、苏混合登山队的第一号高山营地，它比1956年时的大本营高出将近五百公尺，可以节省登山下山一天的路程，以便登山队员把储备的体力直接用到登山活动上去。同时，也能使登山运动员一开头就锻炼出更好的高山适应性。
    大本营基地是在当地柯尔克孜牧民帮助下建立起来的。克孜勒苏柯尔克孜自治州民政科科长禾加木开勒德亲自到这里帮助安排大本营基地。牧民借给了登山队员几个毡房，这种毡房宽大而又御寒。牧民还派出了六十多匹马、毛驴和骆驼畜力等，把三万多斤登山给养运送到大本营基地。
    晚间，气温下降到摄氏零下六度半，水缸结冰一寸多厚，但是在高寒地区，队员在毡房中休息，一点也不觉得寒冷。大家对于这样好的大本营基地感到满意，一场征服“冰山之父”的战斗，便要从这里开始。（待续）
