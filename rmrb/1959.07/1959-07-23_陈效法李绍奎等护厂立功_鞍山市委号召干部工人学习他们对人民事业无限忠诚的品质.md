According to the Liaoning Daily, Chen Xiaofa, chief foreman of the open hearth furnace at Anshan Iron and Steel Company's No. 1 Steelmaking Plant, and Li Shaokui, chief furnace operator of the No. 7 open hearth furnace, remained calm and courageous in the face of an emergency where oxygen cylinders were likely to explode. With the selfless coordination of Yu Deju, chief furnace operator of the No. 9 open hearth furnace, and Hu Xiling, head of the gas inspection team, they quickly eliminated the potential accident, safeguarding production and the safety of the employees.

The Anshan Municipal Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party attached great importance to the heroic deeds of Comrades Chen Xiaofa and Li Shaokui. After the incident occurred, they immediately sent a letter expressing their condolences and convened a meeting of employees at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's No. 1 Steelmaking Plant on July 2nd to introduce their heroic deeds. On July 5th, the Municipal Party Committee issued another notice, not only praising Chen Xiaofa and Li Shaokui's noble qualities once again but also requiring Party organizations at all levels to organize all Party members, cadres, and the masses of workers to learn from the spirit of infinite loyalty to the Party and the people's cause and the high sense of responsibility of Comrades Chen Xiaofa, Li Shaokui, and others. Mobilize all Party members and the broad masses of workers to take Comrades Chen Xiaofa and Li Shaokui as examples, give full play to their production enthusiasm and creativity, take action to overcome difficulties, solve key production problems, and strive to ensure the completion of this year's steel production and other plans.
