    Taming the "Black Dragon"
    By our reporter Shi Bo
    Several kilometers from the Tianjin No. 1 Power Plant, one can clearly see the silver-gray smoke trails billowing from four tall chimneys, drifting into the distance.
    Seeing these silver-gray smoke trails, one cannot help but recall the scene of half a year ago. At that time, these four tall chimneys were spewing out rolling black smoke day and night. People said that these were several "black dragons" released by the Tianjin No. 1 Power Plant. The black smoke contained a large amount of unburned coal dust, which fell on the faces and clothes of passers-by, and on the nearby factories and neighborhoods. Sometimes, four or five tons of coal would fly out of the chimneys in just a few minutes. The workers felt heartache seeing so much coal flying out of the chimneys, and the stokers were even more anxious. Yu Wanming, the young stoker of Furnace No. 4, which had the thickest smoke and the most combustible coal in the smoke, looked up at the chimney almost every day before work. He secretly made up his mind: to tame this "black dragon", eliminate the combustible coal in the smoke, and reduce coal consumption!
    Twenty-two-year-old Yu Wanming came to the Tianjin No. 1 Power Plant at the age of fifteen. In 1955, when Furnace No. 4 was built and put into production, he became the stoker of Furnace No. 4. This furnace is a new type of 130-ton medium-pressure boiler with thirty or forty photoelectric buttons, making it difficult to operate. Furnace No. 4 started to emit black smoke as soon as it started running, and the coal pulverizer often leaked coal dust into the furnace, which was not burned completely and flew out of the chimney. After more than two years of operation, some people believed that the main reason for this situation was equipment problems, and there was no other way but to replace the equipment. Yu Wanming and Deputy Stoker Yang Deyuan did some calculations: if the combustible coal in the smoke of one furnace is reduced by 2%, 170 kilograms of coal can be saved per hour, more than four tons can be saved per day, and more than sixteen tons can be saved for four boilers. What an astonishing figure this is! They proposed: to reduce the combustible coal in the smoke from 10% to below 5% within a month. The stokers of each shift in Furnace No. 4 immediately launched a "break through the five percent barrier" (5%) competition, and Yu Wanming and Deputy Stoker Yang Deyuan of Shift D wanted to be the first to break through the 5% barrier. To "break through the five percent barrier", the first thing to solve was the problem of coal dust leakage. The two of them went to check the coal feeding system, studied its performance, and recorded the operating indicators of each experiment, analyzing them after each shift. In the process of analyzing and recording indicators every day, Yu Wanming discovered that when the coal dust level in the coal dust bin was maintained at a height of 5.5 to 6 meters, the coal dust would not leak and the spiral coal feeder could feed coal stably; if it was higher or lower, the coal feeder would not be easy to control, and coal dust would automatically leak into the furnace. The coal dust that automatically flowed into the furnace was redundant and would fly out of the chimney if it was not completely burned. Yu Wanming contacted the coal delivery branch to keep the coal dust level in the coal dust bin at a height of 5.5 to 6 meters. As a result, the coal dust no longer leaked, and the combustible coal in the smoke dropped from 10% to 6%-7%. The facts proved that one cannot emphasize equipment problems and should first improve technical operations.
    After solving the problem of coal dust leakage, Yu Wanming and Yang Deyuan became more confident in "breaking through the five percent barrier" in a month. Yu Wanming recalled the operating situation of the past two years. Because he always thought that the coal leakage of Furnace No. 4 was an equipment problem, he stuck to the old ways in operation. For example, the damper was always kept at four grids, the air volume was small, there was a lot of black smoke, and coal was wasted. He thought, if the air volume is increased, wouldn't the coal dust in the furnace be fully burned? But then he thought, what if the fire goes out if the wind is too strong, and doesn't it affect the production of the turbine? After work, he consulted with Xie Lianyuan, the shift leader of Shift D and an old stoker, and Engineer Cao: if the air volume is increased from four grids to six grids, is there a risk of extinguishing the fire? After careful research and calculation, Engineer Cao and Xie Lianyuan believed that increasing to six grids would not necessarily extinguish the fire, and they encouraged Yu Wanming and Yang Deyuan to try it once. The next day as soon as Yu Wanming went to work, he increased the damper from four grids to six grids. Deputy Stoker Yang Deyuan ran to the top floor of the boiler room to observe the color of the smoke, and the chemist also came to help them test the content of combustible coal in the smoke and check the boiler temperature. After testing, the combustible coal in the smoke was greatly reduced; but a new problem appeared: the boiler temperature dropped by ten degrees, affecting the economic effect of the boiler. At this time, Yu Wanming took out the optical pyrometer, which he didn't often use in the past, to carefully observe the inside of the furnace. He asked Yang Deyuan to lower the damper by one grid, keeping it at five, and after another ten minutes of observation, he returned to the boiler control panel with a relaxed smile. It turned out that the furnace temperature decreased because the wind was strong, changing the center position of the furnace fire. Adjusting to five grids brought the center of the furnace fire back to its original position, adjusting the amount of coal feeding, making the air and coal feeding stable at an index, and the combustible coal in the smoke dropped to 4%. They finally realized their plan to "break through the five percent barrier" in a month.
    Yu Wanming and Yang Deyuan were not satisfied with this achievement. Combustible coal accounting for 4% is still a considerable number, and nearly ten tons of coal dust still fly out of the chimney every day! Yu Wanming said to Yang Deyuan: "The content of combustible coal in the smoke must be reduced again and again." They established a system for recording technical operating indicators and analyzing them every day. In the first quarter of this year, when analyzing operating indicator records, they found that the four dampers of Furnace No. 4 broke the convention of having smaller air volumes in the middle two dampers and larger air volumes in the two dampers on both sides, reducing the combustible coal in the smoke to 2%. The next day, they experimented with parallel opening of the dampers, and as a result, the combustible coal in the smoke not only did not decrease, but increased by 1%. After observation and calculation, it turned out that after parallel opening of the dampers, the total amount of air was less than before, and the coal dust could not be fully burned in the furnace. After appropriate adjustment of the air volume, the combustible coal in the smoke was reduced to 1.3%. At this time, he ran out of the boiler room to take a look, and the huge "black dragon" was gone, the silver-gray smoke trail appeared, and the chimney no longer spewed out so much troublesome coal dust!

    驯服“黑龙”
    本报记者　史博
    在距离天津第一发电厂几公里的地方，便能清楚地看到从四个高大的烟囱里冒出银灰色的烟带，袅袅地飞向远方。
    看到这银灰色的烟带，不由得回想起半年前的情景。那时候，这四个高大的烟囱日夜不停地冒着翻滚的黑烟，人们说这是天津第一发电厂放出的几条“黑龙”。黑烟中有大量没有燃尽的煤粉，落在过路行人的脸上和衣服上，落在附近工厂和里弄里。有时候，几分钟就从烟囱中飞出四、五吨煤。工人们看到这样多煤从烟囱里飞出去觉得心痛，司炉们的心情更是焦急不安。烟最浓、烟中可燃煤最多的四号炉的青年司炉于万明，几乎每天上班以前，都抬头看看烟囱，他暗暗下了决心：驯服这条“黑龙”，消灭烟中可燃煤，降低煤耗！
    二十二岁的于万明，十五岁就来到天津第一发电厂，1955年四号炉建成投入生产，他担任了四号炉的司炉。这个炉是新式的一百三十吨中压锅炉，光电钮就有三、四十个，不容易操作。四号炉开始运转就冒黑烟，煤粉机经常自漏煤粉，流入炉内，燃烧不尽从烟囱里飞出去。经过两年多的操作，有的人认为，出现这种情况的主要原因是设备有问题，除了改换设备没有别的办法。于万明和副司炉杨德源算了一下账：如果一个炉的烟中可燃煤降低2％的话，每小时就可以节约一百七十公斤煤，一天就可以节约四吨多，四个锅炉就节约十六吨多，这是多么惊人的数字呀！他们提出：一个月内把烟中可燃煤由10％降低到5％以下。四号炉各班的司炉立即开展了“破五关”（5％）的竞赛，丁班司炉于万明和副司炉杨德源更是要争取最先突破5％大关。而“破五关”首先要解决煤粉自漏问题。他们俩便去检查给粉系统，研究它的性能，并把每次试验的操作指标记录下来，在每天班后进行分析。在天天分析记录指标的过程中，于万明发现煤粉仓里的煤粉位置，保持在五米五到六米的高度时，煤粉就不自漏，螺旋式的给粉机就能稳定地给粉；高了或者低了，给粉机就不容易控制，煤粉会自动漏入炉膛。自动流入炉膛的煤粉是多余的，燃烧不完就从烟囱里飞走了。于万明便和送煤分场联系，使煤粉仓里的煤粉位置经常保持五米五到六米的高度。这样一来，煤粉不自漏了，烟中可燃煤由10％下降到6％—7％。事实证明，不能强调设备问题，首先要改进技术操作。
    解决煤粉自漏问题以后，于万明和杨德源对一个月“破五关”信心更大了，于万明回忆了两年多来的操作情况。由于思想上总认为四号炉漏粉是设备问题，在操作上便墨守陈规。例如，风门老是保持在四格上，风量小，黑烟多，浪费煤。他想，把风量加大，炉膛内的煤粉不就能充分燃烧了吗？但是又一想，风大了灭了火怎么办，不影响汽轮机生产吗？下班以后，他便找丁班班长、老司炉谢连元和曹工程师请教：如果把风量由四格加到六格，是否有灭火的危险。曹工程师和谢连元经过周密研究和计算以后认为，增加到六格不一定就会灭火，他们鼓励于万明、杨德源试验一次看看。第二天一上班，于万明便把风门由四格增加到六格，副司炉杨德源跑到锅炉房的最上层观察烟的颜色，化验员也来帮助他们化验烟中可燃煤的含量，检验锅炉温度。经过化验，烟中可燃煤降低了很多；但是一个新的问题出现了：锅炉温度下降了十度，影响了锅炉的经济效果。这时候，于万明找出过去不经常用的光学高温计来，对炉膛内仔细观察。他叫杨德源把风门下降一格，保持在五上，又经过十来分钟的观察，他带着轻松的微笑回到了锅炉操纵盘上。原来炉温降低是因为风大，改变了炉火中心位置，调到五格上炉火中心回到了原来位置，调整了给粉量，使给风给煤稳定在一个指标上，烟中可燃煤下降到4％。他们终于实现了一个月“破五关”的计划。
    于万明和杨德源并没有满足于这个成绩。烟中可燃煤占4％仍是一个不小的数字，每天还有近十吨的煤粉从烟囱里飞出去！于万明对杨德源说：“烟中可燃煤含量必须降低再降低。”他们建立了记录技术操作指标和天天分析的制度。今年第一季度，在分析操作指标记录时，发现四号炉的四个风门打破了中间两个风量小、两边两个风量大的惯例，使烟中可燃煤降低到2％。第二天，他们便试验平行开风，结果烟中可燃煤不但没有下降，反而上升了1％。经过观察和计算，原来是平行开风以后，风的总量比原来减少，煤粉不能在炉内充分燃烧。适当调整风量以后，烟中可燃煤降低到1.3％。这时候，他跑出锅炉房去一看，巨大的“黑龙”不见了，银灰的烟带出现了，烟囱里再也不冒出那么多令人头痛的煤粉了！
