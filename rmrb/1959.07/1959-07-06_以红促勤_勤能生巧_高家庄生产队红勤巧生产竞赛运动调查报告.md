    Promoting Diligence with Redness, Diligence Leads to Skill:
    Investigation Report on the Red, Diligent, and Skillful Production Competition Movement in Gaojiazhuang Production Team
    Hao Zhanao, Liu Shangde
    Since the beginning of spring this year, the Gaojiazhuang Production Team of the Wangbaiyin Management Area, Chengguan Red Flag People's Commune, Wuxiang County, Shanxi, has launched a collective high work efficiency red, diligent, and skillful competition movement. This enthusiastic competition movement has prompted a rapid increase in the labor efficiency of the entire team. From the first to the middle of the fourth lunar month, the male full and semi-labor force of this production team averaged 1.96 workdays per person per day; the female full and semi-labor force averaged 1.51 workdays per person per day. In the fifteen days from the middle of April to the end of the month, the average labor days done by male full and semi-labor force increased to 2.2 per person per day; because many women's children had measles and many people did not go to the fields for five or six days, the female labor force also averaged 1.36 workdays per person per day. Due to the rapid increase in labor efficiency, all kinds of farm work in the team were ahead of schedule. Although this year's production tasks are much larger than in previous years, and seven strong laborers were transferred out; all autumn fields have been tilled three times and harrowed four times, the field ridges have been repaired, and the amount of fertilizer applied has increased by a quarter compared with last year; sowing work was completed more than ten days ahead of the management area's plan.
  A Red Line Running Through the Movement
    Gaojiazhuang is a remote small mountain village with fourteen households, fifty-one people, planting one hundred and seventy mu of sandy land on mountain ridges and in gullies, with most of the farm work relying on "one carrying pole and two shoulders." In recent years, although agricultural production has greatly developed, it is still the poorest production team in the entire management area.
    However, "poor people are not poor in ambition." At the beginning of the year, the Gaojiazhuang Production Team set a leap forward plan of 350 jin of grain per mu (46% higher than last year), determined to get rid of the label of poverty. The biggest difficulty in achieving this plan is the lack of labor. The team has a total of twenty-two male and female full and semi-laborers, and seven strong laborers have gone out to support industrial construction and reservoir construction; of the fifteen people left behind, apart from the cook, feeder, and lying-in women, only eleven people can truly participate in agricultural production, of which six are female laborers. According to the members' original reported work points, there is a one-third difference from the total number of work points needed for the whole year. Solving the labor problem has become the key to this year's leap forward. Captain Gao Ersuo handed this "bottom line" to everyone, asking members to come up with ideas. The members' opinion was: living people cannot be suffocated by urine, the whole team should work together with one heart and one mind, everyone should get up early and work until late, and get the work done. The collective high work efficiency competition movement was launched on this basis. Everyone being red, diligent, and skillful is a red line running through this movement.
        Red – Ideologically Red, Striving for Excellence
    The first reason for the high work efficiency of the Gaojiazhuang Production Team is that everyone in the team strives to improve, and everyone is full of energy.
    Since the team put forward the slogan "One person should do the work of two, unite and strive for high yield," the members have been working hard from dawn to dusk, vying to be the first. The feeder Gao Miaosuo, in addition to feeding five livestock well, has to do one and a half workdays every day; Gao Aizhen, a woman with three children, can do two workdays every day, surpassing a man; Wang Erhuan, an old woman in her fifties, takes care of six children, and also helps her husband feed the livestock in her spare time, doing one workday a day. The team affairs committee summarized their experiences as models for the whole team, mobilizing all team members to learn from them. Starting in March, the team also organized a "Five Good" member competition, with the conditions being: "Five Comparisons" (compare ideology to see who is Red – has communist consciousness, compare labor to see who is Diligent, compare work efficiency to see who is High, compare suggestions to see who is Ingenious, compare responsibility fields to see who is Good), "Three Requirements" (must obey leadership, abide by operating procedures, and cherish public property), "Five No's" (no need to be called to labor, no waiting for people to go to the fields, no redoing work, no wasting time, no walking empty-handed). Evaluations are held once a month, with good ones being commended and rewarded, and shortcomings being reviewed and corrected. The team's three Party members took the lead in striving for the
  "Five Goods," ensuring that their families also strive to meet the "Five Good" conditions, and also dividing up responsibility for helping the masses. In this way, role models were examples, the "Five Goods" were the direction, Party members were leaders, and everyone in the team strove for excellence. Since March, no one in the team has been absent from work; except for a few women who took a few days off due to their children's illness, the attendance rate reached 100%. In the May evaluation of "Five Good" members in the entire management area, five people from the Gaojiazhuang Production Team received certificates of merit, six people were commended, and 90% of the male and female laborers were on the honor roll.
      Diligence – No Time Wasted, No Empty Trips
    The second reason for the high work efficiency of the Gaojiazhuang Production Team is that there are no idlers in the team, everyone is diligent, everyone does a variety of work, and they do whatever they are supposed to do.
    In the Gaojiazhuang Production Team, there are no idle people, young or old. Full laborers do heavy work, semi-laborers do light work, and the elderly do odd jobs. Four old women around fifty years old who cannot go to the fields have all become nursery workers; the new daughter-in-law Wu Juhua went to the fields the day after she got married, and did two workdays on the third day.
    Male and female full and semi-laborers all do a variety of work, and they do whatever they are supposed to do. The feeder Gao Miaosuo feeds the livestock early in the morning, drives the livestock to plow the fields in the morning, and hands the livestock over to his wife to take care of in the afternoon, and then goes to weed and chop grass. The cook Gao Sanhai, in addition to cooking for fifty-one people, also has to take time to work in the fields for half a day. Some members who get off work early also take time to deliver manure and carry water. 社员巩银玉 Member Gong Yinyu watched the sheep at night, and dug a fourteen-zhang long edge of the field in one night.
    No empty people entering or leaving the village is the new atmosphere of the Gaojiazhuang Production Team. Members carry a load of manure when they go to the fields; when they come back from work, they either carry a bundle of straw or a load of water. The team has never assigned full-time workers to do odd jobs such as carrying water, transporting straw, and transporting manure to nearby fields. Children also carry manure when they come home from school.
      Skill – Modifying Tools, One Skill for Multiple Uses
    The third reason for the high work efficiency of the Gaojiazhuang Production Team is hard work plus skillful work, studying technology diligently, using tools skillfully, and everyone is a master of all trades. The natural conditions of this village are not good, and even a small flatbed cart cannot pass through, but the members still thought of many ways to reform tools and improve operating methods. The old carpenter Wang Fuchang modified a carrying pole that is elastic and light to use. In the past, when planting corn intercropped with beans, two people were needed to hold baskets and sow seeds; the female member Wei Cuixian came up with a way to hang two pockets in front of her chest, sowing corn with her left hand and bean seeds with her right hand, and one person could do the work of two people. All the team's small farm tools were lined up, with strong laborers using heavy hoes, large shovels, and large manure baskets, which were handy to use; female laborers used light hoes, thin shovels, and smaller baskets, which were flexible to use.
    The Gaojiazhuang Production Team also paid special attention to organizing members to learn technology. 老农经常给大家传授技术，介绍干活的窍门；队里普遍实行了师傅带徒弟。 老农经常给大家传授技术，介绍干活的窍门；队里普遍实行了师傅带徒弟。 Old farmers often taught everyone techniques and introduced the tricks of working; the team generally implemented the system of masters teaching apprentices. No matter what kind of work was being done, an experienced agricultural technician led several "half-baked" workers, teaching whatever was being done, teaching while doing. When carrying manure, they would introduce "using force on the toes when going uphill, and exerting force on the heels when going downhill"; when sowing, they adopted the method of the master leading the apprentice, hoeing and guiding at the same time. The experienced agricultural technician Gao Tuxiao used the method of "master helping the apprentice to sow," and quickly taught the woman Gao Aizhen how to plant millet. Now all five male laborers in the team are masters of all trades; three of the six female laborers have become masters of all trades, and the other three can do anything except operate the seed drill. Because everyone is proficient in technology and everyone is versatile, labor efficiency has been greatly improved.
    Management Work Keeps Up
    Everyone being red, diligent, and skillful, and everyone having high work efficiency, has raised many new issues for the leadership of production: to keep the members' enthusiasm always strong, it is necessary to do a good job in ideological work, but also to have reasonable labor remuneration; to ensure that everyone's time is not wasted, production organization and management work must be more specific and detailed; members who work hard day and night all hope to arrange their lives satisfactorily; .... Reasonably solving these problems and continuously improving the leadership of the production team has become the key to promoting the in-depth development of the collective high work efficiency competition movement.
    Grasping Quotas – Everyone Discusses, Fair and Reasonable
    In the past, the Gaojiazhuang Production Team implemented a system of recording work points based on a base score, regardless of what kind of work was being done, women got "old eight points" and men got "old ten points." After the launch of the red, diligent, and skillful competition movement, although everyone's enthusiasm was not small, unreasonable remuneration hindered the members' enthusiasm. In the first few days, heavy work could not be assigned. Captain Gao Ersuo asked his daughter Gao Aizhen to carry manure, but Aizhen refused. Gao Ersuo was annoyed and said that Aizhen was "deliberately creating difficulties for him and not obeying leadership" and wanted to reason with Aizhen at the members' meeting. Unexpectedly, the members all sympathized with Gao Aizhen, saying, "If light and heavy work are not distinguished and the same work points are recorded, who would be willing to do heavy work?" This reminded Gao Ersuo, and after discussing with the management area, he implemented a method of recording work points based on quotas.
    How to set reasonable labor quotas? The members said: as long as the leadership speaks up, everyone is a sage. After discussion, it was decided that the captain would grasp the standard and the members would democratically evaluate. The method was: what kind of work is done, what kind of work points are evaluated, and finally passed by the members' meeting. The team formulated more than one hundred and sixty kinds of quotas, dividing them into grades according to the lightness or heaviness of the work and the level of technicality. Because the quotas were evaluated by everyone, the members felt that they were fair and reasonable, and the attendance rate was greatly improved, from passively competing for points to actively grabbing work.
    Grasping Arrangements – Democratic Assignment of Work, Making the Best Use of Talent
    With reasonable labor quotas, everyone asked the captain to assign work in a timely manner and arrange suitable work. As a result, the captain was busy all day and could not go to the fields, and the members still had opinions. Once, Captain Gao Ersuo had just returned from a meeting outside, and because he did not understand the situation, he assigned the member Gao Qinghe to dig the edge of the field in the West ditch, which had already been dug, resulting in a wasted trip; Gao Qinghe proposed that the team give him a contract for the work. Gao Ersuo was forced to get anxious and proposed that everyone be the captain and discuss things together. The members agreed with his opinion. From then on, the team's work plans and production arrangements were discussed jointly by the members, and work was assigned, worked on, and responsible for together. Doing so greatly stimulated the members' enthusiasm and sense of responsibility. In mid-May, plowing, digging field edges, and sowing were squeezed together, and there was not enough labor. When discussing the work plan, the member Gao Tuxiao put forward a suggestion: send food to distant fields and work all day, and carry it out on the way to nearby fields in the morning and evening. As a result of the implementation, more than thirty workdays were saved.
    In order to give full play to everyone's labor potential, after discussion by the members, two reforms were carried out in management one after another. First, assign work every five days. The method is: according to the small-scale work plan, determine the work to be done by the team within five days at the members' meeting, stipulate the cultivated plots and quality, time requirements; then assign five days of work to the members at a time according to each member's expertise and willingness; within these five days, the members actively arrange their own work. Second, assign work according to the individual. Assign appropriate work to each member according to their physical and technical conditions and personal requirements. For example, the feeder Gao Miaosuo, in addition to feeding the livestock, also asked to go to the fields, so his feeding time was taken into account and he was assigned to plow the fields; the cook Gao Sanhai, in addition to cooking, also wanted to work, so he was assigned to do more mobile farm work such as weeding in nearby fields. The team did not assign full-time workers to do odd jobs such as carrying water, transporting straw, and delivering fertilizer to nearby fields, but let the members take time to do them on the way. In this way, the members all had suitable work, and they had a clear idea of what kind of work to do, so they could actively arrange, fully prepare, and make reasonable use of time, reducing idle work and waste. The production captain Gao Ersuo was also freed from the trivial matters of assigning work every day, and could both work with everyone and concentrate on checking the quality of cultivation and solving the main problems in production.
    Grasping Life – Active Care, Thoughtful Care
    The members have all投入了紧张的投入了紧张的高工效竞赛运动，就迫切要求把生活安排得更好。投入了紧张的投入了紧张的高工效竞赛运动，就迫切要求把生活安排得更好。 Members have all投入了紧张的投入了紧张的高工效竞赛运动，就迫切要求把生活安排得更好。Everyone has投入了紧张的投入了紧张的高工效竞赛运动，就迫切要求把生活安排得更好。Everyone has投入了紧张的投入了紧张的高工效竞赛运动，就迫切要求把生活安排得更好。Everyone has投入了紧张的投入了紧张的高工效竞赛运动，就迫切要求把生活安排得更好。Everyone has投入了紧张的投入了紧张的高工效竞赛运动，就迫切要求把生活安排得更好。Everyone has投入了紧张的投入了紧张的高工效竞赛运动，就迫切要求把生活安排得更好。Everyone has投入了紧张的投入了紧张的高工效竞赛运动，就迫切要求把生活安排得更好。Everyone has投入了紧张的投入了紧张的高工效竞赛运动，就迫切要求把生活安排得更好。投入了紧张的投入了紧张的高工效竞赛运动，就迫切要求把生活安排得更好。They are eager to arrange their lives better.投入了紧张的投入了紧张的高工效竞赛运动，就迫切要求把生活安排得更好。The most important thing that everyone cares about is: eating their fill, eating well, resting well, and taking care of the elderly and children.The most important thing that everyone cares about is: eating their fill, eating well, resting well, and taking care of the elderly and children.In view of this situation, the Gaojiazhuang Production Team has paid attention to actively caring for and comprehensively arranging the lives of members while focusing on production.In view of this situation, the Gaojiazhuang Production Team has paid attention to actively caring for and comprehensively arranging the lives of members while focusing on production.They implemented a large Sunday system, taking one day off every half month, allowing members to arrange their own lives, go to the market to buy things, visit relatives, sew and mend, and handle household affairs.In the past, members had to ask for a day off for personal matters, but now they all managed to not ask for leave during the week, and arrange household affairs in a planned way on Sundays.The team issued two and a half jin of subsidized grain to each child every month, so that the nursery workers could cook a pot of porridge for the children to eat in the morning; elderly people were given one jin of white flour for their birthdays; women were given three days of light work during menstruation; women who were more than six months pregnant were withdrawn from the fields to grind rice and flour.In terms of food, they adopted the method of eating thick and good food for heavy work, and eating thin and poor food for light work.The team used meal times and breaks in the fields to hold meetings, and tried not to take up the members' rest time, so that everyone could rest well.When the members came back from the fields and saw the elderly happy and the children smiling, eating comfortably and resting well, they felt happy and everything went smoothly, and all their energy was concentrated on production.
  Opening Up a Path for Collective High Work Efficiency
    Carrying out the collective high work efficiency competition movement has greatly improved labor efficiency, and many farm work has been done ahead of schedule. From the first to the fifth lunar month, the Gaojiazhuang Production Team has completed more than two thousand five hundred workdays, an increase of more than one and a half times compared with the same period last year, accounting for more than 53% of the total number of contracted workdays in the team.
    Obviously, with the in-depth development of the high work efficiency competition movement, the number of workdays done by members will rapidly increase, and the total number of contracted workdays given to the team by the management area will be greatly exceeded. This raises a new question: how to fully utilize and give play to the role of these workdays? If this problem is handled well, it can enable the collective high work efficiency competition movement to continue to develop and make agricultural production gallop on horseback. If it is not handled well, there will be a period of rushing work, followed by a sigh of relief, making the collective high work efficiency competition movement sometimes tight and sometimes loose; or "exerting strength but not using it on the cutting edge," with a lot of work points being earned, but the production effect is not good, relatively affecting the income of workdays.
    The Gaojiazhuang Production Team carefully studied this problem and, while carrying out the high work efficiency competition movement, put forward the slogan of "increasing production and increasing income." They determined the output, measures, cultivation time, work points, and responsible members for each piece of land in the team, strictly implemented the quality inspection system, and regularly checked the implementation of measures to ensure that each piece of cultivated land was of high quality and that all measures were implemented in the fields. At the same time, they used the work driven by high work efficiency to vigorously carry out farmland capital construction, laying a solid material foundation for increasing production.
    While striving to increase agricultural production, they also paid attention to continuously opening up new production avenues, using the power of collective high work efficiency to develop diversified economies and increase the income of members. In late May, taking advantage of the gap after the basic completion of sowing, the team organized members to rush to plant more than thirty mu of beans, oil crops, and other crops on scattered land. In early June, taking advantage of the gap after the basic completion of weeding of large autumn crops, the team organized members to launch a surprise construction of a pig farm to develop the pig breeding industry.
    At present, with the help of the management area, the Gaojiazhuang Production Team is brewing, vigorously grasping fruit tree production, expanding the existing pear tree and grape vineyards, and turning the entire village into a mountain of flowers and fruits.

    以红促勤　勤能生巧
    高家庄生产队红勤巧生产竞赛运动调查报告
    郝占敖　刘尚德
    今年开春以来，山西武乡县城关红旗人民公社王白堙管理区高家庄生产队，掀起了一个集体高工效的红勤巧竞赛运动。这个热气腾腾的竞赛运动，促使全队劳动效率迅速提高。阴历1至4月半，这个生产队的男子全半劳力，每人每天平均做到一点九六个劳动日；妇女全半劳力每人每天平均做到一点五一个劳动日。4月半到月底的十五天，男子全半劳力每人每天平均做的劳动日提高到了二点二个；妇女劳力因为孩子得麻疹，许多人有五、六天没有上地，每人每天也平均做到一点三六个劳动日。由于劳动效率迅速提高，全队各种农活事事赶在前面。虽然今年的生产任务比往年大的多，又外调了七个精壮劳力；但全部秋田做到了三耕四耪，修整了边堰，施肥量比去年增加了四分之一；播种工作比管理区的计划提前十多天完成了。
  贯穿运动的一条红线
    高家庄是个偏僻的小山庄，全村十四户，五十一口人，种着一百七十亩山梁、沟凹夹砂地，大部分农活靠的是“一条扁担两个肩”。几年来，农业生产虽有很大发展，但仍然是全管理区最穷的生产队。
    不过“人穷志不穷”。年初，高家庄生产队订出了亩产粮食三百五十斤的跃进计划（比去年提高46％），要坚决摘掉穷帽子。实现这个计划，最大的困难是劳力不足。全队共有二十二个男女全半劳力，有七个精壮劳力外出支援工业建设和修水库；留下来的十五个人，除了炊事员、饲养员和产妇，真正能参加农业生产的只有十一个人，其中六个是妇女劳力。根据社员原来的报工数，和全年的需工数相差三分之一。解决劳力问题，成了今年跃进的关键。队长高二锁把这个“底”交给大家，让社员们出主意。社员们的意见是：活人不能让尿憋死，全队齐心合力，人人起早搭黑，把工赶出来。集体高工效竞赛运动就在这个基础上开展起来了。人人红、勤、巧，则是贯穿这个运动的一条红线。
        红——思想红，争上游
    高家庄生产队的工效高，第一个原因是全队人人努力向上，个个干劲冲天。
    自从队里提出了“一人要做两人活，齐心合力争高产”的口号，社员们起早搭黑苦干，个个踊跃争先。饲养员高庙锁除了喂好五个牲口，每天还要做一个半劳动日；有三个孩子的妇女高爱珍，每天能做两个工，赛过一个男子汉；五十多岁的老大娘王二焕，看护着六个娃娃，抽空还帮助老伴喂牲口，一天能做一个劳动日。队务委员会总结了他们的经验，作为全队的标兵，发动全队社员向他们学习。从3月份开始，队里又组织了“五好”社员竞赛，条件是：“五比”（思想比红——有共产主义觉悟、劳动比勤、工效比高、献计比妙、责任田比好）、“三要”（要服从领导、遵守操作规程、爱护公共财物）、“五不”（劳动不用叫、上地不等人、做活不返工、时间不空过、走路不空行）。每月评比一次，好的表扬奖励，有缺点检讨改正。队里的三个党员带头争
  “五好”，保证家里人也力争达到“五好”条件，还要分片包干帮助群众。这样，标兵是榜样，“五好”是方向，党员是带头人，全队人人力争上游。从3月份以来，全队没有一个人旷工；除了几个妇女因孩子生病请过几天假，出勤率达到百分之百。5月份全管理区“五好”社员评比结果，高家庄生产队有五个人获得奖状，六个人受到表扬，90％的男女劳力上了红榜。
      勤——时不空过，路不空行
    高家庄生产队的工效高，第二个原因是全队无闲人，人人都勤劳，个个都干多样活，该着做啥就做啥。
    在高家庄生产队，男女老少没闲人。全劳力干重活，半劳力干轻活，老年人干零活。有四个五十岁左右的老太太不能下地，都当了保育员；新媳妇武菊花过门第二天就下了地，第三天就做了两个劳动日。
    男女全半劳力都干多样活，该着做啥就做啥。饲养员高庙锁，早起喂好牲口，上午赶上牲口犁地，下午把牲口交给老伴代管，他又去锄苗、铡草。炊事员高三孩除了做五十一个人的饭，还要抽空下地劳动半天。有的社员下工早，抽空还要送粪、挑水。社员巩银玉晚上看羊，一黑夜捎带刨了十四丈长的一道边堰。
    进村出村没空人，是高家庄生产队的新风气。社员们下地都要捎一担粪；下工回来不是捎一捆秸秆，就是捎一担水。像担水、运秸秆、近地运粪等零星活，队里就没有派过整工。孩子们下学回家，也要捎带拾粪。
      巧——改制工具，精一兼数
    高家庄生产队的工效高，第三个原因是苦干加巧干，钻研学技术，工具得心应手，人人都是全把式。这个村的自然条件不好，连辆小平车也不能通行，可是社员们还是想了许多办法来改革工具，改进操作方法。老木匠王福昌改制了一种扁担，用起来弹性大、轻巧。过去种玉米间作豆子，要两个人拿着篮子点籽；女社员魏翠仙想了个办法，胸前挂两个口袋，左手点玉米，右手点豆籽，一个人能干两人活。全队的小农具都排了队，精壮劳力使用重钁、大锹、大粪筐，用着得手；妇女劳力使用轻钁、薄锹、较小的箩头，用起来灵巧。
    高家庄生产队还特别注意组织社员学习技术。老农经常给大家传授技术，介绍干活的窍门；队里普遍实行了师傅带徒弟。不管干啥活，一个技术老农带领几个“二把刀”，做啥教啥，边做边教。担粪的时候就介绍“上坡脚尖用劲，下坡脚后跟出力”；播种的时候，采用师傅带着徒弟干，一边锄一边指导。技术老农高秃小用“师傅帮耧徒弟种”的办法，很快就教会了妇女高爱珍种谷。现在全队五个男劳力都是全把式；六个妇女劳力有三个成了全把式，另外三个人除摇耧外啥活也能干。由于人人精通技术，个个都是多面手，大大提高了劳动效率。
    管理工作跟上来
    人人红勤巧，个个高工效，就给生产的领导工作提出了许多新问题：要使社员的干劲永远旺盛，既要做好思想工作，又必须有合理的劳动报酬；要做到人人时间不空过，生产组织与管理工作就必须更加具体细致；社员们连明搭夜苦干，都希望把生活安排的称心如意；……。合理地解决这些问题，不断地改进生产队的领导，就成为促进集体高工效竞赛运动深入开展的关键。
    抓定额——大家评议，公平合理
    过去，高家庄生产队实行的是以底分记工，不管干什么活，妇女“老八分”，男人“老十分”。开展红勤巧竞赛运动以后，虽说大家的劲头不小，但报酬不合理，也妨碍了社员的积极性。头几天，重活就派不出去。队长高二锁让他女儿高爱珍去担粪，爱珍也不去。高二锁恼火了，说爱珍“故意给他造困难，不服从领导”，要和爱珍去社员会上说理。不料社员们都同情高爱珍，说：“轻重活不分，一样记工，谁愿意干重活？”这一下把高二锁提醒了，经过和管理区研究，实行以定额记工分的办法。
    如何把劳动定额定的合理呢？社员们说：只要领导放了话，众人是圣人。经过讨论，决定由队长掌握标准，社员民主评定。办法是：干什么活，评什么工分，最后由社员大会通过。全队制定了一百六十多种定额，根据活计轻重、技术性高低，划分了等级。因为定额是由大家评定，社员都感到公平合理，出勤率大大提高，由消极争分变成了积极抢活。
    抓安排——民主派活，人尽其才
    劳动定额合理了，大家都要求队长及时派活，安排合适的活计。这一来，队长成天忙的下不了地，社员还有意见。有一次，队长高二锁出外开会刚回来，因为不了解情况，派社员高庆和去已经刨了边堰的西沟去刨边堰，结果白跑了一趟；高庆和提出要队给包工。逼得高二锁急了，提出大家都来当队长，有事情共同商量。社员们同意了他的意见。从此，队里的作业计划、生产安排都通过社员共同讨论，共同派活，共同劳动，共同负责。这样做，大大刺激了社员的积极性和责任心。5月中旬，犁地、刨边、下种等三种活挤在一起，劳力顾不过来。讨论作业计划时，社员高秃小提出一条建议：远地送饭一天干，门边近地早晚捎带干。执行的结果，节省了三十多个工。
    为了发挥每个人的劳动潜力，经过社员讨论，在管理上先后进行了两项改革。第一、五天一派活。办法是：根据小段作业计划，在社员会上确定五天内全队要做的活，规定出耕作地块和质量、时间要求；然后按照每个社员的特长与自愿，一次给社员派五天的活；在这五天内，由社员主动安排自己的工作。第二、因人派活。根据每个社员的身体、技术条件和本人要求，派给他适当的工作。比如饲养员高庙锁除了喂牲口还要求下地，就照顾他的喂养时间，分配他犁地；炊事员高三孩除了做饭还想干活，就分配他在村边近地里锄苗等机动性较大的农活。挑水、运秸秆、近地送肥等零星活，队里不派整工，让社员们抽空捎带干。这样，社员们都有了合适的工作，干什么活计心里有了底，就能够主动安排，充分准备，合理利用时间，减少窝工浪费。生产队长高二锁也就从每天派活的琐事中解放出来，既能和大家一起劳动，又能集中精力检查耕作质量，解决生产中的主要问题。
    抓生活——主动关怀，照顾周到
    社员们都投入了紧张的高工效竞赛运动，就迫切要求把生活安排得更好。大家最关心的是：吃饱吃好休息好，老人娃娃照顾周到。针对这一情况，高家庄生产队在大抓生产的同时，注意了主动关怀与全面安排社员的生活。他们实行了大星期日制度，半个月放假一天，让社员安排自己的生活，赶集买东西，走亲戚，缝缝补补，处理家务事。过去社员有点私事就得请一天假，现在都做到了平时不请假，把家务事有计划地安排在星期日。队里每月给每个孩子发二斤半补贴粮，让保育员在半前晌
  给孩子们煮一顿稀饭吃；老年人过生日，发给一斤白面；妇女月经期间调换三天轻活；怀孕六个月以上，从地里抽回来碾米磨面。在伙食上采取了重活吃稠吃好，轻活吃稀吃次。队里开会利用吃饭和地头休息时间，尽可能不占用社员休息时间，让大家好好休息。社员们下地回来，看见老人喜欢、娃娃笑，吃的舒服休息的好，心里舒畅，事事如意，全部精力就都集中到了生产上。
  为集体高工效开山辟道
    开展集体高工效竞赛运动，大大提高了劳动效率，许多农活赶在了前面。阴历1至5月，高家庄生产队已经做出劳动日两千五百余个，比去年同期增加了一倍半多，占全队包工总数的53％以上。
    很明显，随着高工效竞赛运动的深入发展，社员做的劳动日还会迅速增加，管理区给队的包工总数将被大大突破。这里就提出了一个新问题：如何充分利用与发挥这些劳动日的作用？这个问题如果处理的好，就能使集体高工效竞赛运动继续向前发展，使农业生产跨上骏马。如果处理不好，就会发生赶一段工、松一口气，使集体高工效竞赛运动时紧时松；或者是“使出劲来用不在刀刃上”，工分做的不少，生产效果不好，相对地影响劳动日的收入。
    高家庄生产队认真地研究了这个问题，在开展高工效竞赛运动的同时，提出了“增产量、增收入”的口号。他们把全队的土地逐块地定了产量、措施、耕作时间、工数和责任社员，严格质量检验制度，经常检查措施贯彻情况，保证块块耕地质量高，条条措施落到田。同时利用高工效赶出来的工，大搞农田基本建设，为提高产量打下雄厚的物质基础。
    在力争农业增产的同时，也注意了不断开辟新的生产门路，利用集体高工效的威力，发展多种经济，增加社员收入。5月下旬，趁播种基本结束的空隙，队里组织社员在零星土地上抢种豆子、油料等作物三十多亩。6月上旬，趁大秋作物基本锄完的空隙，组织社员突击建设养猪场，发展养猪事业。
    目前，在管理区的帮助下，高家庄生产队正在酝酿，大抓果树生产，扩大现有的梨树、葡萄园，使全村变成花果山。
