    Streamlining Meetings Before and After
    Liu Quingui
    The cadres and members of the Yuecheng Brigade of the Caojun Commune in Huarong, Hunan, are truly energetic in their campaign for a thousand-jin harvest! In order to concentrate the energy of cadres and the masses on winning this battle, they tried every means and adopted many measures, one important measure being: streamlining meetings.
    Speaking of meetings, this brigade held too many in the previous period, with meetings large and small almost every day; and there was a "three-long" phenomenon: that is, long waiting times for meetings, long reports by leading cadres, and long work arrangements. Because of the "three-longs," sometimes a meeting would last until the middle of the night, affecting sleep and daytime production. With cadres spending too much time in meetings, they didn't have much time to go deep into the fields. After the launch of the thousand-jin harvest campaign, the general branch was determined to change this situation and made a special study on how to improve meetings. It was decided to streamline meetings according to the principle of "fewer meetings, better meetings, fewer reports, more discussions," using the methods of pushing, pressing, merging, unifying, and concluding. The so-called "push" means postponing meetings that do not need to be held temporarily; "press" means resolutely not holding meetings that can be dispensed with; "merge" means combining meetings that can be held together into one; "unify" means unified arrangements for the work of various departments; "conclude" means taking the approach of field meetings to collect reports, closely combining production inspection with production arrangements. In addition, it was also required that there be preparation before the meeting so that each meeting could effectively solve problems; it was required that meetings start on time, and it was stipulated that evening meetings should not exceed 10:30 pm. After these decisions were made, the cadres and the masses all praised them.
    Making decisions is one thing, putting them into practice is another. To this end, the general branch secretary paid special attention to setting an example and taking the lead. The first time he held a cadre meeting, he acted according to the new regulations: preparing in advance, starting the meeting on time, giving fewer reports, and encouraging more discussions so that everyone could speak freely and pool their wisdom. He criticized and educated the two cadres who were late. These two cadres were a little embarrassed and promised not to be late again in the future. Sure enough, the second time they were notified to hold a meeting after dark, a roll call was taken at the appointed time, and not a single person was missing. Branch secretary Liu Yungui said happily: "It's really good to hold meetings like this! The time is short, there's no need to stay up late, the work is clearly arranged, and we can take the lead in production better in the future."
    As soon as the general branch set an example, superiors influenced subordinates, and the "three-long" phenomenon in meetings disappeared. Cadres had ample time to go deep into the fields and work with the members; the members were no longer worried about staying up late for meetings. From then on, the thousand-jin harvest became even more vigorous.

    精简会议前后
    刘权贵
    湖南华容操军公社岳城大队的干部和社员，搞千斤丰产运动的劲头真足！为了集中干部、群众的精力打好这一仗，他们想方设法，采取了许多措施，其中一项重要的措施是：精简会议。
    说起开会，这个大队在前一段是开得过多了些，大大小小的会，差不多天天都有；而且存在“三长”现象：即等会时间长、领导干部的报告长、布置工作长。由于“三长”，有时一个会开到半夜三更，影响睡眠和白天生产。干部开会过多，也就没有好多的时间深入下去。千斤丰产运动开展后，总支下决心改变这种状况，就如何改进开会作了专门研究。决定本着
  “少开会，开好会，少报告，多讨论”的原则，用推、压、并、统、结的办法，精简会议。所谓“推”就是把暂时不必开的会推后一步；“压”，就是把可以不要开的会坚决压下去不开；“并”，就是把可以合在一起开的会并作一次开；“统”，就是各部门工作统一进行布置；“结”，就是采取田间碰头，收集汇报，把检查生产与布置生产紧密结合起来。除此以外，还要求会前有准备，使每个会能切切实实地解决问题；要求准时开会，并规定晚上开会不超过十点半钟。这些决定作出后，干部、群众个个称好。
    作了决定，还得付诸实践。为此，总支书记特别注意以身作则，首先自己作出榜样。第一次开干部会，就按新的规定行事：事先作好准备，准时开会，少报告，多讨论，使每个人畅所欲言，集思广益。对迟到的两个干部，进行了批评教育。这两个干部有些不好意思，保证今后不再迟到。果然，第二次通知天黑开会，到时点名，一个不差。分支书记刘云贵高兴地说：“这样开会真好！时间不长，不要熬夜，工作布置得清清楚楚，以后能够更好地带头生产了。”
    总支一作出样子，上行下效，开会“三长”的现象没有了。干部有了充裕的时间深入田间，和社员们一块劳动；社员们也再不担心开会熬夜。从此，千斤丰产搞得更加火红。
