Talking About Returning Rice Straw to the Field

Rice straw is a good organic fertilizer. According to analysis, it contains about 80% organic matter, 0.63% nitrogen fertilizer, 0.1% phosphorus fertilizer, and 0.85% potassium fertilizer. It also has a wide range of adaptability and is not particular about soil. It can be applied to either sandy or clayey soil. Therefore, without hindering farmers' needs for straw, using rice straw to return to the field as fertilizer is a good way to obtain materials locally, save labor, reduce costs, and broaden fertilizer sources.

According to the experience of the masses, the following points must be paid attention to when using rice straw as base fertilizer:

	(1) Rice straw should be dried to 60% before being applied to the field. It is not easy for either living or withered straw to decompose. Because fresh living straw contains too much moisture and the thin-walled tissues of the cells are not destroyed, it is not easy to rot. Withered rice straw loses too much moisture, the protein dehydrates and becomes a gel, the tissue shrinks, and effective nutrients are not easily decomposed or rotted.

	(2) The amount of rice straw used as base fertilizer should be appropriate and not too much, otherwise the heat generated when the rice straw rots and decomposes will burn the seedlings. Generally, for early rice planted more densely, returning 50% of the rice straw harvested from the field to the field as base fertilizer is sufficient. When applying rice straw, the straw should be chopped short, the shorter the better, and spread evenly, otherwise it will hinder plowing and transplanting.

	(3) The fertilizer effect of rice straw is relatively slow, and some quick-acting nitrogen fertilizer (preferably ammonium sulfate or well-rotted human and animal manure) should be applied in conjunction to promote early revival of the seedlings.

	(4) When applying rice straw as base fertilizer, lime can also be applied in combination to accelerate the decomposition of the rice straw and neutralize the acidic substances produced during the decomposition of the rice straw. However, the amount of lime should not be too much, generally 50 or 60 jin per mu is sufficient, too much will burn the rice plants to death. Also, do not apply lime while transplanting seedlings, but prepare the field in advance and postpone transplanting.

    谈谈稻草还田
    稻草是一种良好的有机肥料。据分析，其中含有机质80％左右，含氮肥0.63％，磷肥0.1％，钾肥0.85％。它的适应性也很广泛，不忌土壤，无论砂质或粘质土壤都可以施用。因此，在不妨碍农家用草需要的情况下，利用稻草还田做肥料，是一种就地取材、节约人工、成本小、肥源广的好办法。
    根据群众的经验，用稻草作基肥，必须注意以下几点：
      （一）稻草要晒六成干再施到田里，施用活草或枯草都不容易腐烂。因为新鲜活草水分过大，细胞薄壁组织未破坏，不易腐烂。晒枯的稻草失去水分过多，蛋白质脱水变成凝胶体，组织紧缩，有效养分不易分解，也不易腐烂。
      （二）用稻草作基肥要适量，不宜过多，否则稻草腐烂分解时所发的热会把秧苗烧坏。一般的插得较密的早稻，以本田稻草收获量50％还田作基肥就可以了。施用稻草时要把草铡短，越短越好，并要均匀散开，否则妨碍耕田和插秧。
      （三）稻草肥效较迟缓，要配合施用一些速效氮肥（最好是硫酸铵或腐熟的人畜粪），以促进秧苗早返青。
      （四）施用稻草作基肥，还可配合施用石灰，加速稻草腐烂，并可中和稻草在分解时所产生的酸性物质。但石灰用量不宜太多，一般每亩有五、六十斤即可，多了会把稻棵烧死。也不能边下石灰边插秧，要提前做田，推迟插秧。
