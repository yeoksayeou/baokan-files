Xinhua News Agency, July 7th. The Ministry of Coal Industry convened a telephone conference on July 4th, requesting all coal mines nationwide to seize the opportunity and immediately take advantage of the victory to push the large-scale bumper harvest movement to a new climax, resolutely completing and overfulfilling the production tasks for the third quarter. At the same time, the Jingxi, Huainan, Fushun, Fuxin, and Kailuan Mining Bureaus proposed a challenge to all coal mines nationwide to complete the aforementioned tasks.

The Ministry of Coal Industry pointed out that, according to the laws of past years and the actual situation this year, the coal consumption of various departments of the national economy in the second half of the year is much higher than in the first half; a large part of the coal for the fourth quarter, which has the highest annual consumption, must be produced, transported, and stored in the third quarter. Whether the coal industry completes its production tasks well or poorly in the third quarter affects the production of various economic sectors and the people's lives. The Ministry of Coal Industry requires all coal mine workers to muster their energy, work hard, work practically, and work skillfully to complete and overfulfill the production plan for the third quarter in a faster, better, and more economical way.

The Ministry of Coal Industry pointed out that to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the production plan, it is necessary to organize a new production upsurge on the basis of the great achievements already made in the large-scale bumper harvest this year. Equipment maintenance, labor allocation, safety and quality inspections, rectification of rules and regulations, and all other work must serve the high production, high speed, and high quality of coal mining and tunneling stripping work. To consolidate and expand the achievements of large-scale bumper harvests, it is necessary to strengthen production preparation work. However, production preparation work must be appropriately arranged under the principle of ensuring the completion of the national production plan. The Ministry of Coal Industry pointed out that the experience of the first half of the year proves that only by fully mobilizing the masses to work hard, practically, and skillfully, and mobilizing the masses to carry out technological revolution and technological innovation, can sustained large-scale bumper harvests be achieved. At present, all mines should seriously promote the thirty-six experiences summarized by the Ministry of Coal Industry in light of their own conditions.

In order to provide the necessary materials for the new production upsurge, the Ministry of Coal Industry has established an office to handle the supply of materials and equipment, which is headed by a vice minister. At the same time, it requires all mining bureaus to treat the supply of materials and equipment as an important task. At present, materials urgently needed for equipment maintenance, such as alloy steel, lubricating oil, and iron wire, have been basically resolved. The First Ministry of Machine Building has also sent a working group to inspect and supervise relevant factories to ensure that equipment produced for coal mines is delivered on time or ahead of schedule. Henan, Liaoning, and other places are allocating local resources to support coal mine production. The Ministry of Coal Industry requires all mining bureaus to use existing materials first for the manufacture and maintenance of accessories for mining, tunneling, transportation, and safety equipment; in the allocation of equipment, priority should be given to supplying coking coal mines, as well as those mines and mining areas that can increase coal production by adding a little equipment.

The Ministry of Coal Industry pointed out that the state attaches great importance to coal production, and the leading departments of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions are also strengthening their leadership and support for coal production work; all coal mines also have the experience and useful lessons learned from mobilizing the masses to achieve large-scale bumper harvests in the first half of the year, and the management level of enterprises is gradually improving. Since the coal industry has these and other favorable conditions, as long as the masses are mobilized and enough energy is mustered, the production tasks for the third quarter and the whole year can definitely be completed and overfulfilled.

On July 7th, the Jingxi, Huainan, Fushun, Fuxin, and Kailuan Mining Bureaus proposed an initiative to coal mines across the country to ensure the comprehensive completion and overfulfillment of the third quarter production tasks. The conditions they proposed are: to ensure the balanced completion and overfulfillment of the third quarter production plan; to complete the tunneling stripping work plan on a ten-day and monthly basis, to increase the recoverable period of coal production by one month on the existing basis, to ensure that the quality of coal meets the standards stipulated by the state, to eliminate major accidents, to increase labor efficiency by 10% to 20% compared with 1958, and to reduce production costs by more than 8%. The four mining bureaus of Jingxi, Huainan, Fushun, and Kailuan all won the red flag for large-scale bumper harvests in the first half of the year. Although the equipment for twenty-two "satellite wells" (small coal kilns around large mines) in Huainan Coal Mine in the third quarter could not be delivered on schedule, they still did not lower the production plan, but relied on the masses to tap potential in all aspects to ensure the overfulfillment of the original production plan. Fuxin Mining Bureau did not win the red flag for large-scale bumper harvests in the first half of the year, and they expressed their determination to win the red flag for large-scale bumper harvests in the third quarter. Now, these five mining bureaus are looking forward to coal mines across the country using more and better coal production to compete with them in their efforts to jointly complete and overfulfill the production plan for the third quarter and welcome the 10th anniversary of the National Day.

    煤炭工业部号召全国煤矿立即把大面积丰产运动推向新高潮
    坚决完成第三季度煤炭生产任务
    京西、淮南、抚顺、阜新和开滦矿务局向全国各矿提出竞赛倡议
    新华社7日讯　煤炭工业部7月4日召开了电话会议，要求全国煤矿抓紧时机，立即乘胜把大面积丰产运动推向新的高潮，坚决完成和超额完成第三季度的生产任务。同时，京西、淮南、抚顺、阜新和开滦矿务局向全国各煤矿提出了为完成上述任务的挑战。
    煤炭工业部指出，根据历年来的规律和今年的实际情况，下半年国民经济各部门的用煤量都比上半年多很多；全年用量最多的第四季度的煤炭，有很大一部分要靠第三季度生产、运输和储备。煤炭工业第三季度的生产任务完成得好和不好，影响到各经济部门的生产和人民生活，煤炭部要求各煤矿职工必须鼓足干劲，苦干、实干和巧干，多快好省地完成和超额完成第三季度的生产计划。
    煤炭部指出，要保证完成和超额完成生产计划，必须在今年已经获得巨大成绩的大面积丰产的基础上，乘胜组织新的生产高潮。设备维修、劳动力调配、安全和质量检查、整顿规章制度等一切工作，都要为采煤和掘进剥离工作的高产、高速、高质服务。要巩固和扩大大面积丰产的成绩，必须加强生产准备工作。但是，生产准备工作必须在保证完成国家生产计划的原则下来适当安排。煤炭部指出，上半年的经验证明：只有充分地发动群众苦干、实干、巧干，发动群众进行技术革命和技术革新，才能获得持续的大面积丰产。目前各矿应结合本矿情况，认真地推广煤炭部总结的三十六项经验。
    为了给新的生产高潮提供需要的物资，煤炭部已成立了处理材料设备供应工作的办公室，由一位副部长负责。同时要求各矿务局也要把材料设备供应工作当作一项重要工作来抓。现在，一些维修设备急需的合金钢、润滑油、铁丝等材料已经基本解决。第一机械工业部也派出了工作组，检查和督促有关厂，要把为煤矿生产的设备按时或提前交货。河南、辽宁等地正在调拨地方资源支援煤矿生产。煤炭部要求各矿务局把现有的材料首先用于采掘、运输、安全设备的配件制造和维修方面；在设备的分配上，要首先保证供应主焦煤的矿井，以及那些只要少增加一点设备就能多增产煤的矿井和采区。
    煤炭部指出，目前国家十分重视煤炭的生产，各省、市和自治区领导部门也正在加强对煤炭生产工作的领导和支援；各煤矿也有了上半年发动群众实现大面积丰产的经验和有益的教训，企业的管理水平也正在逐步提高。由于煤炭工业具备了这些以及其它的一些有利条件，只要发动群众，把干劲鼓足，就一定能完成和超额完成第三季度和今年全年的生产任务。
    7月7日，京西、淮南、抚顺、阜新和开滦矿务局，已经向全国煤矿提出保证全面地完成和超额完成第三季度生产任务的倡议。他们提出的条件是：保证均衡地完成和超额完成第三季度的生产计划；按旬按月地完成掘进剥离工作计划，把获得煤量的可采期在现有的基础上增加一个月，煤炭的质量保证合乎国家规定的指标，消灭重大事故，劳动效率比1958年提高10％到20％，生产成本降低8％以上。京西、淮南、抚顺和开滦等四个矿务局，在上半年都获得了大面积丰产的红旗。淮南煤矿第三季度虽然有二十二个“卫星井”（大矿井周围的小煤窑）的设备不能如期到货，但他们仍然不降低生产计划，而是依靠群众从各方面挖掘潜力，来保证超额完成原定的生产计划。阜新矿务局上半年没有获得大面积丰产的红旗，他们表示力争在第三季度夺得大面积丰产红旗。现在，这五个矿务局正期待着全国各煤矿，用生产更多更好的煤炭来和他们比干劲，来共同完成和超额完成第三季度的生产计划，迎接国庆十周年。
            倡议书全国各兄弟煤矿的职工同志们：
    在党的正确领导和总路线的光辉照耀下，我们京西、淮南、抚顺、阜新、开滦五个煤矿和全国各兄弟煤矿一样，在胜利地超额完成了上半年的生产任务的基础上，正信心百倍地为超额完成下半年的生产任务而努力。在7月4日煤炭工业部电话会议上，我们听了煤炭工业部负责同志关于第三季度的工作指示，进一步认识到在当前生产更多更好的煤炭对国计民生的重要意义；也进一步认识到，党和国家非常重视煤炭的生产。我们五个煤矿的全体职工坚决以实际行动响应党和国家的增产节约的号召，认真贯彻执行煤炭工业部第三季度工作指示和全国煤矿大面积丰产红旗竞赛运动第一次评比总结大会精神。决心在这个完成全年计划的决定性的季度，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，大干三个月，保证完成和超额完成第三季度的生产任务和各项经济技术指标。为了互相促进，共同提高，我们五个煤矿的全体职工愿意就第三季度的工作与全国各兄弟煤矿开展友谊竞赛。条件是：
    1、在均衡生产的条件下，保证完成和超额完成第三季度生产计划任务，并为第四季更大的跃进打下良好的基础。
    2、保证按旬按月完成掘进、剥离作业计划；获得煤量可采期限在现有水平上再增加一个月；保证采掘正常衔接和掘进巷道的质量，消灭无效进尺。
    3、煤炭质量保证达到国家规定的指标。
    4、认真贯彻安全生产方针，严格执行安全生产的规章制度，消灭重大事故，加强防水工作，确保雨季安全生产。
    5、认真贯彻淮南劳动组织工作现场会议精神，切实整顿劳动组织，保证第三季全员效率比去年平均指标提高10％—20％。
    6、保证第三季度原煤成本比去年降低8％以上。
    我们实现上述倡议条件的措施是：
    1、加强领导，统一认识，鼓足干劲，力争上游，本着一切往前赶的精神，深入发动群众，迅速掀起一个以大面积丰产红旗竞赛运动为中心的轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动的新高潮。力争今年“十一”获得和再次获得“大面积丰产红旗”。
    2、狠抓企业管理，建立和健全各种规章制度和各级责任制。根据煤炭工业部提出“抓什么工作，就建立什么规章制度”的指示的精神，在第三季内，抓住安全质量大检查、整顿劳动组织、机电设备维修、巷道维护、反对浪费、厉行节约等几项主要工作，深入发动群众，大鸣大放，全面揭发，发现薄弱环节，从而把各种技术管理、生产管理、安全生产的规章制度、设备维修、巷道维护、煤质检查、经营管理等主要规程制度和各级行政领导、技术领导的责任制建立和健全起来，以达到全面提高企业管理水平的目的。
    3、大搞群众性的技术革命和技术革新运动，继续大力推广先进经验，提高设备利用率。以煤炭工业部提出的三十六项行之有效的先进经验为基础，结合本矿区的具体情况和当前生产中的关键问题，抓住几个主要的先进经验，指定专人负责，按规划逐月检查，采用巡回表演、组织参观、现场传授等办法，来保证先进经验的全面推广和不断发展。
    全国各兄弟煤矿的职工同志们：让我们在总路线的光辉照耀下，在煤炭工业部和各级党委的正确领导下，互相学习、互相支援、并肩前进，为完成和超额完成第三季度煤炭生产任务和满足国家需要而奋斗，以获得更大的大面积丰产的成绩来迎接国庆十周年。
