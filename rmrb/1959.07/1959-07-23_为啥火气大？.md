    Why so Angry?
    Ode to the Portrait of the Head of the Greek Military Tribunal
    Poem by Liu Bing, Painting by Ying Tao

	Who provoked him? Why is he so angry:
	Face red, neck thick, veins popping on his forehead,
	Eyes bloodshot, voice hoarse and throat raspy,
	Slamming the table like thunder,
	Spitting saliva like rain.
	Like an epileptic sheep, or an angry toad,
	Jumping with both feet, belly bulging big.
	Why not take it easy, aren't you afraid your belly will explode?
	(It won't explode, it's mounted on a screw base;
	Someone pushes it and it jumps three times.)
	What's it all about? The questioning went wrong,
	The presiding judge becomes the defendant, slapping his own face.
	Plots exposed piece by piece,
	Testimony false word by word.
	Opening his mouth, he stammers, taking the opportunity to change his face.
	Using shame and anger, he plays more tricks:
	"All defendants are not allowed to speak again."
	Like a petty hooligan, using tricks everywhere;
	Pretending to be drunk when not drunk, taking the opportunity to beat people.
	Trying to be clever but becoming clumsy, the world laughs and scolds!
	Losing face is a small matter, the deal becomes empty talk.
	The master will be angry, how can the slave not be afraid!

    为啥火气大？
    希腊军事法庭庭长画像赞
    流冰诗  英韬画是谁惹了他？火气那么大：脸红脖子粗，额角青筋炸，两眼布血丝，声嘶喉又哑，拍案响似雷，喷沫雨般下。活像羊羔疯，又像气蛤蟆，一跳双脚蹬，肚子鼓得大。何不小些劲，不怕肚皮炸？（根本不会炸，身下螺丝架；有人按一按，它就跳三下。）到底为了啥？问案出了岔，庭长变被告，自把嘴巴打。阴谋件件露，证词字字假。张口又结舌，乘势脸变卦。借着恼羞怒，再把阴谋耍：“所有被告人，不许再说话。”活像小流氓，手段处处耍；不醉像装醉，乘机把人打。弄巧反成拙，天下扬笑骂！丢脸事还小，买卖成虚话。主子要生气，奴才怎不怕！
