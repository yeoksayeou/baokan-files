    Police Chief and Qi Baishi's Paintings
    Migu
    Some time ago, there was a short news item in the newspaper saying that a certain newspaper in Spain advocated banning the Soviet film "Don Quixote" from entering the country because Don Quixote on the screen was a red "secret agent" suspected of attempting to infiltrate Spain to "carry out communist propaganda." After reading it, I was completely baffled. I have also seen this movie, but I didn't find—as is often found in Hollywood movies—silent pistols, landing equipment. Nor did I hear Don Quixote shouting any "strike" slogans. I thought to myself: Maybe the editor of this newspaper received special training at the American intelligence agency and had other "secrets," which is also possible.

    Recently, I happened to see an order from the Thai Police Chief, Nai Sawaeng Sawaensri: prohibiting the entry and circulation of the Chinese "Qi Baishi's Grass and Insect Flower Paintings" collection. The order did not specify the reason, which made us very puzzled. Thinking about it, could it be that this Chief also discovered that this old painter was actually disguised as a red "secret agent," and his "grass and insect flower paintings" were also "carrying out communist propaganda." It is a coincidence that I also have Qi Baishi's paintings hanging in my study, and I always admire them with great pleasure during my spare time from work. But I never thought that there was such a "mystery" in them.

    Since the Police Chief's order "pointed" this out, I have been pondering Qi Baishi's grass and insect flower paintings every day, looking at them again and again, sometimes even turning the paintings over to look at the back, or tearing off the pasted paper layer by layer, and using a magnifying glass to look at them. But, after looking and looking, I still can't figure out what's going on. It seems that those people do have "wise eyes" and are different from others. I happened to mention this to a friend, but he saw through it in one word. He said: Don Quixote can see windmills as giants. Although he broke his own head, he is not a "mortal" after all. The great editor in Spain and the Chief in Thailand are merely inspired by his old man's spirit. He advised me to also look at those paintings with Don Quixote's eyes, and maybe I would gain some understanding.

    The next day, I recognized myself as Don Quixote. Although I didn't have armor or a spear, my eyes, thoughts, and logic were all based on his old man's set of rules as much as possible. Strangely enough, I vaguely heard the two prostitutes in that small inn ennobling me as "Police Chief" and "Anti-Communist Knight" (this is a new title in the 20th century), and I suddenly became clear-headed and my eyes were bright, and I finally saw through the "malicious conspiracy" of "Qi Baishi's Grass and Insect Flower Paintings" without any doubt!

    You see, this is something falsely called "peony", actually painted a big red peony on white paper. Why not paint black peony, white peony, blue peony but specifically want to paint red peony? Isn't the intention clear? Twenty years ago, "Chairman" Chiang Kai-shek arrested people wearing red cheongsams, and today you still want to deceive me, Chief? Bah! You see, this is supposed to be a "crab." Someone said that crabs can be served with wine, that is a "communist bewitched" way of saying it. Why doesn't he paint peanuts and broad beans? Isn't it using "crab" to point at our noses and scold us for being "tyrannical"? The real purpose of this "crab" is to incite ignorant common people to rebel; you see, this is the so-called "melon and fruit", eggplants, Chinese cabbage, etc., and this "small fish" is a "propaganda item" for the Communist Party's "economic aggression." Prime Minister Field Marshal Nai Sarit on the constituent assembly had agonized over Chinese rapeseed, fish fries entering the country until he wanted to die. As a Police Chief, how can I tolerate this kind of "propaganda" spreading everywhere! You see this so-called "frog", isn't it painted very interestingly and likable? I tell you, Communist elements are bad because of this, they deliberately paint it so vividly and cutely, making you fascinated when you see it. It is said that Qi Baishi has always painted frogs so lifelike, which shows that this person is an old hand among "secret agents"; To be honest, this "shrimp" is the only one that gives me a headache, but after all it revealed its tail in front of me. I suddenly remembered that Uncle Sam had banned Chinese lobsters from entering the country. Moreover, I once learned from Don Quixote's appearance of "bitter training" on the hillside, stripped naked (fortunately, the weather is hot now), and carefully examined this "shrimp" of unknown origin head down and feet up. Sure enough, among the messy shrimp whiskers and shrimp feet, I found vaguely "sickle and axe" and other symbols; As for the name "Qi Baishi," although he deliberately used the word "white" to cover it up, the seal is "red," which is undoubtedly "signaling" to the Thai people, asking them to raise the red flag to make a communist revolution...

    Enough, enough, the "incriminating evidence" of Qi Baishi's "grass and insect flower paintings" is undoubtedly confirmed, and Qi Baishi's identity—a red "secret agent"—is as indisputable as I am a "mad Chief." Writing this, I routinely shouted: "Come on, file this material!"

    警察总监和齐白石的画
    米谷
    前一时期报上有一条短消息，说西班牙的某报主张禁止苏联电影“唐·吉呵德”入境，因为银幕上的唐·吉呵德是一个赤色“秘密间谍”，有企图渗入西班牙“进行共产主义宣传”的嫌疑。看了，真使人丈二和尚摸不着头脑。我也看过这部电影，可是并未发现——例如好莱坞片子中所经常发现那样——无声手枪、降落设备。也没有听到唐·吉呵德喊什么“罢工”的口号。心想：也许这家报社的编辑在美国情报局受过特别训练，另有“诀窍”，也未可知。
    最近，偶然又看到了泰国警察总监乃沙怀·沙怀盛耶功的一道命令：禁止中文“齐白石草虫花卉”画集入境和传阅。命令中没有讲明原因，使我们十分纳闷。推想起来，莫非是这位总监老爷也发现了这位老画家原来是由赤色“秘密间谍”化装而成，他的那些“草虫花卉”也是“进行共产主义宣传”。说来真也凑巧，我书房里也挂着齐白石的画，每逢工作之余总要怡然自得地对它们赞叹不已。但从来没有想到其中却有如此一番“奥妙”。
    自从警察总监的命令“指点”之后，我就天天琢磨齐白石的草虫花卉，看了又看，有时还要把画翻转来看看背后，或把裱糊的纸一层层撕开来，用放大镜来照。但是，看来看去总看不出一个名堂来。看来他们那些人确乎另有“慧眼”，与众不同。偶然将此事与一朋友谈及，却被他一言道破，他说：唐·吉呵德能把风车看成巨人，虽然弄破了自己脑袋，但毕竟不是“肉眼”凡胎。西班牙的大编辑和泰国的总监老爷，无非是受了他老人家的精神感召。他劝我不妨也用唐·吉呵德的眼光来看看那些画，也许会有所领悟。
    第二天，我就自认是唐·吉呵德了。虽然没有盔甲长矛，但眼光、思想、逻辑都尽量按他老人家一套规矩。说来真也奇怪，我居然隐隐听得那小客栈里的两个土娼在封我什么“警察总监”兼“反共骑士”了（这是二十世纪的新封号），而我顿时变得脑筋开朗、目光炯炯，终于把“齐白石草虫花卉”的“恶毒阴谋”洞悉无遗了！
    你们看，这是伪称“牡丹”的东西，竟然在白纸上涂了一朵大大的红色牡丹。为什么不画黑牡丹、白牡丹、蓝牡丹而偏偏要画红牡丹？其用意难道还不明白吗？二十年前蒋介石“委员长”就抓过穿红旗袍的人，今天还想来骗我总监老爷？呸！你们再看，这算是“螃蟹”。有人说螃蟹可以下酒，那是着了“共产魔道”的说法。为什么他不画花生米和兰花豆？难道不是借“螃蟹”来指着鼻子骂我们“横行无道”吗？企图煽动无知小民造反是这幅“螃蟹”的真正目的；你们看，这是所谓“瓜果”，茄子白菜什么的，还有这幅“小鱼”，都是共产党“经济侵略”的“宣传品”。内阁总理乃沙立元帅在制宪会议上曾为中国菜籽、鱼苗入口而痛不欲生，我做警察总监者岂能再容这种“宣传品”到处传阅！你们再看这幅所谓“青蛙”，画得不是很有趣、很讨人喜欢吗？告诉你，共产分子坏就坏在这种地方，他故意画得如此生动可爱，使你看了着迷。听说齐白石一向把青蛙画得活龙活现，可见此人是一个“秘密间谍”中的老手；说实话，琢磨来琢磨去只有这幅“虾”最使我伤脑筋，但毕竟在我眼前露了尾巴。我猛然记起山姆叔曾禁止过中国龙虾过境。况且，我曾一度学着唐·吉呵德在山坡上“苦炼”的模样，混身脱得精光（好在现在天气炎热）、头着地脚朝天般细细审查过这个来历不明的“虾”。果然，在乱七八糟的虾须虾脚之间，我发现了隐隐有“镰刀斧头”之类的标记；至于“齐白石”这个名字，虽然故意用一个“白”字来掩护，但图章却是“红色”的，无疑是在向泰国老百姓“打暗号”，要他们举起红旗闹共产革命……
    够了，够了，齐白石“草虫花卉”的“罪证”已确凿无疑，而齐白石的身份——一个赤色“秘密间谍”——也犹如我是一个“疯子总监”那样无可争辩。写到这里，我照例高呼：“来人呀，把这份材料存案！”
