    Cuba's "July 26th Movement"
    Today, a grand gathering will be held in Havana, the capital of Cuba, to mark the sixth anniversary of the founding of the "July 26th Movement." This is a gathering of the Cuban people expressing their determination to defend the revolution and oppose foreign armed intervention.
    The "July 26th Movement" was an armed uprising launched by the Cuban people on July 26, 1953, against the Batista dictatorship. Its founder was Fidel Castro, the current Prime Minister of Cuba. At the time, he was the leader of the student movement, and he led a group of young people to attack the Moncada Barracks in Oriente Province, Cuba. The attack failed, and he was sentenced to fifteen years in prison. After being released in the 1954 amnesty, Castro engaged in organizing an armed uprising movement, and since then, the anti-dictatorial struggle he led has been called the "July 26th Movement."
    The armed revolution carried out under the organization and leadership of the "July 26th Movement" went through an arduous journey. In December 1956, Castro led eighty-one comrades across the sea from Mexico back to Cuba, landing in Oriente Province. After a bitter battle with the dictator's government troops, only a dozen or so people remained. They sneaked into the Sierra Maestra mountains, established a base, and launched guerrilla warfare. This unveiled the prelude to the Cuban people's armed struggle against the dictatorship. In the early stages of the armed struggle, the guerrillas, due to their small numbers, operated only in the Sierra Maestra region, adopting methods of struggle such as burning sugar cane fields, sugar mills, and explosions. At that time, although some armed riots and military uprisings also occurred throughout the country, they were all brutally suppressed due to a lack of mass base and being isolated and helpless. Under Batista's bloody rule, batches of patriots and innocent people were persecuted. The blood of the martyrs ignited anger in the hearts of the Cuban people, and the anti-dictatorial struggle became increasingly deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Farmers in Oriente Province, unable to endure the oppression of Batista's troops, also flocked to the guerrillas, making the revolutionary ranks increasingly strong. The "July 26th Movement" had close ties with the vast number of Cuban farmers and gained their strong support. Farmers played an important role in the first stage of the revolution. At the same time, members of this movement also began secret work among the workers, established contact with the workers, and organized workers' strikes to support the uprising. In this way, the struggle gradually expanded. By 1958, the guerrillas' activities spread throughout the province, threatening the dictatorial rule. Therefore, in June and July of the same year, the Batista dictator launched a general offensive against the guerrilla zone in Oriente Province. However, more than 10,000 government troops, protected by tanks and aircraft, were defeated by the insurgent army. After this battle, the situation changed greatly, and the insurgent army shifted from defense to offense. The battle also began to shift from guerrilla warfare based in rural areas to the stage of attacking and besieging cities.
    At the important moment of the revolution, the leaders of the "July 26th Movement" accepted the initiative of the People's Socialist Party and issued a statement calling on all patriotic forces against imperialism and dictatorship to strengthen unity and jointly overthrow the military dictatorship government. In July, Castro's representatives and other anti-dictatorial organizations in Cuba signed the "Caracas Pact" in Venezuela, unifying the anti-dictatorial forces that were originally in a state of division. These actions, which were beneficial to the revolution, made the revolution a people's movement.
    From November 1958, when the insurgent army besieged Santiago, Cuba's second-largest city, Batista's dictatorial regime was on the verge of collapse. The revolutionary tide swept across the entire Cuba. The insurgent army successively occupied many important towns. Finally, with the general strike of workers in the capital Havana and the citizens rising up to cooperate, after two years of armed struggle, the Cuban revolution led by the "July 26th Movement" finally overthrew the dictatorial regime, drove away Batista, and established the Cuban provisional government.

### 古巴“7月26日运动”

    古巴“7月26日运动”
    今天，在古巴首都哈瓦那举行“7月26日运动”创立六周年的盛大集会。这是一次古巴人民表示决心保卫革命和反对外国武装干涉的集会。
    “7月26日运动”是古巴人民在1953年7月26日发动的反对巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的武装起义。它的创始人是古巴现任总理菲德尔·卡斯特罗。当时他是学生运动的领袖，他率领了一批青年进攻古巴奥连特省的蒙卡达兵营。失败，被判十五年徒刑。1954年大赦获释后，卡斯特罗就从事组织武装起义运动，从此，他所领导的反独裁斗争就称为“7月26日运动”。
    在“7月26日运动”组织领导下进行的武装革命经历了艰苦的历程。1956年12月，卡斯特罗率领了八十一个战友从墨西哥渡海打回古巴，在奥连特省登陆，经过和独裁政府的军队苦战，只剩下十几个人，潜入马埃斯特腊山区，建立了根据地，展开游击战，这就揭开了古巴人民反独裁武装斗争的序幕。游击队在武装斗争的初期，由于人少，活动的范围仅限于马埃斯特腊地区，采取的是焚烧蔗园、糖厂和爆破等斗争的方法。当时全国范围内虽然也出现了一些武装暴动和军队起义，但都由于缺乏群众基础，孤军无援而遭到残酷镇压。在巴蒂斯塔的血腥统治下，成批爱国者和无辜人民被残害，烈士们的鲜血在古巴人民的心中燃起了怒火，反独裁的斗争日益深入人心，奥连特省的农民也由于不堪忍受巴蒂斯塔部队的压迫而纷纷投奔游击队，使得革命队伍日益壮大。“7月26日运动”同古巴广大农民有了密切的联系，并获得了他们有力的支持，农民们在革命的第一阶段起了重要的作用。与此同时，这个运动的成员在工人中也开始了秘密工作，和工人建立了联系，组织工人罢工支援起义。这样斗争就逐步扩大，到1958年，游击队的活动遍及全省，已威胁到了独裁统治，因此在同年6、7月间巴蒂斯塔独裁者就向奥连特省的游击区发动了总进攻，拥有坦克、飞机作掩护的一万多政府军却被起义军所击溃。经过这场战役，局势大为改观，起义军由防御转为进攻，战斗也开始由以农村为据点的游击战进入了进攻和包围城市的阶段。
    在革命的重要时刻，“7月26日运动”的领导人接受了人民社会党的倡议，发表声明号召一切反帝、反独裁的爱国力量加强团结，共同来推翻军事独裁政府。并在7月，卡斯特罗的代表和古巴其他反独裁组织在委内瑞拉签署了“加拉加斯协定”，将原来处于分裂状况的反独裁力量统一起来了。这些有利于革命的行动，使革命成为一个人民的运动。
    从1958年11月，起义军包围古巴的第二大城——圣地亚哥起，巴蒂斯塔的独裁政权就摇摇欲坠，革命的怒潮就席卷了整个古巴，起义军连续占领了许多重要的城镇，最后在首都哈瓦那工人的总罢工和市民奋起配合下，经历了二年的武装斗争，“7月26日运动”领导的古巴革命终于推翻了独裁政权，赶走了巴蒂斯塔，成立了古巴临时政府。（贞）
