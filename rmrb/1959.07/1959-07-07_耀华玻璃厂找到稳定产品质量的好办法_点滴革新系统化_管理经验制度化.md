(This article was transmitted by our newspaper from Tianjin on the 6th) The Flat Glass Branch of the Qinhuangdao Yaohua Glass Factory has adopted the method of turning the masses' incremental experiences into complete operating procedures, which has guaranteed product quality and steadily increased output.

In order to improve the quality of glass, the factory's Party General Branch launched a major quality inspection campaign in April. Through inspection, everyone realized that to improve glass quality, it is necessary to improve operating methods and improve management systems. Then, the Party General Branch put forward the slogan of "inspecting and rectifying at the same time," and the workers in each workshop proposed and adopted many effective measures to improve glass quality. For example, the workers of Furnace No. 1 promoted the experience of the Dalian Glass Factory in controlling furnace temperature, and the defects such as waves and bubble lines on the glass surface were significantly reduced. The workers of the Wendeping group in the drawing section adopted the operation method of large burning and large stirring during furnace tapping, which increased the glass drawing temperature and basically solved the problem of crystallization and bumps on the glass. Workers in the slicing, boxing, and raw material sections also proposed new operating methods. Therefore, the first-grade rate of flat glass quickly increased from more than 70% in the past to 95.4%. However, this achievement was not consolidated. Entering May, the quality of glass dropped again. Sometimes the first-grade rate of glass only reached 79%.

In order to steadily improve the quality of glass, the factory's Party General Branch launched a great debate in early May, with the central topic of "Why can't the quality of glass be consolidated and steadily improved?" In six days, the workers wrote more than 7,000 big-character posters and put forward more than 5,000 opinions and suggestions. Everyone unanimously believed that the failure to consolidate glass quality was mainly due to the failure of technical management to keep up. The fragmented operating methods researched and improved by various processes and groups were not studied and evaluated, and a unified set of operating procedures was not formulated. Therefore, some good operating methods could not be effectively implemented among all workers.

Based on the opinions of the masses, the Party General Branch immediately organized engineering and technical personnel to form three professional research groups: high-quality and high-yield, production management, and equipment maintenance. They adopted the method of combining key experiments with mass discussions to systematize the masses' incremental experiences and formulate a complete set of operating procedures and management systems from raw material testing, formula, melting furnace, plate making to product inspection and packaging, so that the quality and output of flat glass steadily improved. For example, in the past, the workers in the glass melting furnace and gas furnace processes operated inconsistently, the melting furnace temperature fluctuated greatly, and the glass liquid was uneven in concentration, resulting in many waves and bubble lines on the glass surface. The high-quality and high-yield technology research group summarized the operating methods of gas workers and dissolving workers, and formulated the three stability (stable gas supply to the melting furnace, stable calorific value of gas, and stable furnace layer of the gas furnace) operation method for gas furnaces and the two stability (stable air and gas, stable opening and closing of wind and fire dampers) operation method for glass melting furnaces. Each shift also established a post responsibility system and a contact system for gas workers, dissolving workers, and drawing workers, overcoming the inconsistent operations between upper and lower processes and between shifts, and the melting furnace temperature was uniform and suitable. In terms of production management, the factory established a quality inspection system. From raw material formulation, production semi-finished products to cutting, packaging and warehousing, special personnel were responsible for checking the quality at every checkpoint. By May 28, the refined product rate of flat glass increased by 20% compared with April, the first-grade rate reached more than 93%, and the daily output of flat glass reached more than 9,000 boxes.

    耀华玻璃厂找到稳定产品质量的好办法
    点滴革新系统化　管理经验制度化
    本报天津6日电　秦皇岛耀华玻璃厂平板玻璃分厂，采用变群众点滴经验为成套操作规程的办法，保证了产品质量，同时产量也稳步提高。
    为了提高玻璃质量，这个厂的党总支，在4月份就发动群众进行质量大检查。通过检查，大家认识到，要提高玻璃质量，必须改进操作方法，健全管理制度。接着党总支提出了边查边改的口号，各车间职工提出和采取了许多提高玻璃质量的有效措施。如一号溶窑工人推行了大连玻璃厂控制溶窑温度的经验，玻璃面上的波斤、泡线等毛病显著减少。引上工段温德平小组的工人在打炉时采取了大烧大搅的操作方法，提高了玻璃引上温度，基本上解决了玻璃上的结晶和疙疸问题。切片制箱和原料工段的工人，也提出了新的操作方法。因此，平板玻璃的一级品很快就由过去的70％多提高到95.4％。但是这个成绩没有巩固住，进入5月，玻璃质量又降下来了，有时玻璃的一级品率仅达到79％。
    这个厂的党总支为了使玻璃的质量稳步提高，5月上旬以“为什么玻璃质量不能巩固和稳步提高”为中心议题，发动全体职工进行大鸣大放。六天时间，职工们写了七千多张大字报，提出了五千多条意见和建议。大家一致认为：玻璃质量不能巩固主要是技术管理没有跟上去，各工序、小组研究改进的零碎的操作方法，没有加以研究鉴定，制订出一套统一的操作规程，因而使一些好的操作方法不能很好地在全体职工中贯彻实行。
    党总支根据群众的意见，立即组织工程技术人员组成优质高产、生产管理、设备维修三个专业研究小组，采取重点试验与群众讨论相结合的办法，将群众创造的点滴经验系统化，制订出从原料化验、配方、溶窑、制板一直到产品检验和包装等一整套操作规程和管理制度，使平板玻璃质量和产量稳步提高。如过去玻璃溶窑和煤气炉两个工序的工人操作不统一，溶窑温度波动很大，玻璃液浓稀不均匀，使玻璃面上出现很多波斤和泡线。优质高产技术研究小组总结了煤气工和溶解工的操作方法，制订出煤气炉三稳（供给溶窑的煤气稳、煤气发热量稳、煤气炉炉层稳）和玻璃溶窑两稳（空气、煤气稳，风、火闸门开关稳）操作方法，各班还建立了岗位责任制和煤气工、溶解工、引上工联系制度，克服了上下工序和班与班之间操作不统一的现象，溶窑温度均匀适宜。在生产管理方面，这个厂建立了质量检查制度，从原料配方、生产半成品到切装入库，道道关口都有专人检查质量。到5月28日，平板玻璃的精制品率便比4月份提高了20％，一级品率达到93％以上，平板玻璃日产量也达到九千箱以上。
