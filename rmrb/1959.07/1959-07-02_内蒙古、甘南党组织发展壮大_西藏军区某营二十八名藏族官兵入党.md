Party Organizations in Inner Mongolia and Southern Gansu Grow and Expand
Twenty-Eight Tibetan Soldiers in a Certain Battalion of the Tibet Military Region Join the Party

    (Our Newspaper) News: Through several years of organizational and ideological construction, the Party organizations in Inner Mongolia have gradually grown and expanded. At present, there are more than 224,000 Party members in the region, of which 35,698 are from Mongolian, Hui, Manchu, Daur, Ewenki, and Oroqen ethnic groups, accounting for 2.8% of the region's ethnic minority population. Compared with 1954, the number of Mongolian Party members has increased by 1.2 times, Hui Party members by 2.8 times, and Daur Party members by 8 times. Among these Party members, 14,290 are new members admitted last year. These individuals were admitted only after long-term cultivation and education by the Party organizations, and especially after being tested in movements such as the rectification campaign, the Great Leap Forward in production, and the people's communization. Many of them are high-level intellectuals from various ethnic groups.
    Due to the continuous growth and expansion of the Party ranks, Party organizations have a considerable foundation in various regions and systems. Now, the vast majority of factories, mines, enterprises, organs, schools, and people's commune management areas (production brigades) have established grassroots Party organizations. Grassroots Party committees have also been established in the 153 pastoral communes where Party building started later.
    Xinhua News Agency News: Seventy-three local state-owned industrial and mining enterprises and thirty-five people's communes in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture have established grassroots Party organizations. The prefecture now has 7,560 Communist Party members, of which 1,715 are from Tibetan, Hui, Baoan, and Salar ethnic groups, accounting for 22% of the total number of Party members in the prefecture.
    Since the democratic reform last year, Party organizations in Gannan have developed rapidly, and a large number of progressive elements with communist consciousness have been admitted to the Party. They mostly came from herdsmen and serfs and were tempered in movements such as democratic reform, the Great Leap Forward in steel production, and communization. Last year, the number of newly established Party branches in Tibetan areas increased by one and a half times compared to before the democratic reform.
    The grassroots Party organizations in the Gannan area have fully played their role as a fortress. The Party branch of the Pioneer Production Team of the Taoyang Commune in Lintan County led the masses to actively engage in production, transforming the poor mountain gully that had "nine famines in ten years" into a prosperous place where "production increases every year, and life improves step by step." In conquering drought, greening Hongzao Mountain, and repairing irrigation canals, Party members always took the lead and fought in the most dangerous sections. In order to expand the cultivated area, Party members Lu Baoguo and Li Rongdong took the lead in settling on the mountain, and under their influence, twenty-four poor peasant households also moved into the mountain.
    Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 1st: The Party organization of a certain battalion of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region successively admitted twenty-eight outstanding Tibetan soldiers to the Party on the eve of "July 1st."
    The Party organization of this battalion attaches great importance to cultivating Tibetan soldiers, often helping them to improve their class consciousness and understanding of the Party, and admitting outstanding members among them to the Party. Many Han cadres actively learn the Tibetan language so that they can directly help Tibetan soldiers.
    After joining the Party, Tibetan soldiers can set an example and endure hardship in the forefront when performing various tasks. During a march, Jie Cuo, the Tibetan platoon leader of the third platoon of the first company, was in poor health. The deputy instructor asked him to ride a horse, but he gave the horse to a sick soldier and insisted on walking. Sometimes, he also helped weak soldiers carry their guns, encouraging the soldiers to move forward. He said, "I am not only an officer of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, but also a member of the Communist Party of China. I must lead the entire platoon well and complete the tasks assigned to us by the Party."
    These Tibetan Communist Party members are very concerned about the interests of the masses and strive to carry out mass work. Once, to help the masses affected by the floods, they took the lead in donating money. Communist Party member Dan Mique automatically donated all of his two hundred yuan in allowances, which he had saved for many years. They also led the soldiers to risk their lives to rescue Tibetan compatriots who had fallen into the water.
    Under the cultivation and education of the Party, the class consciousness of these Tibetan Communist Party members has been greatly improved, their position is firm, and they safeguard the interests of the Party everywhere. They actively publicize the Party's policies and lead everyone to make progress together through their exemplary actions.

### 内蒙古、甘南党组织发展壮大  西藏军区某营二十八名藏族官兵入党

    内蒙古、甘南党组织发展壮大
    西藏军区某营二十八名藏族官兵入党
    本报讯　经过几年来的组织建设和思想建设，内蒙古党的组织已逐步发展壮大。目前，全区共有党员二十二万四千余名，其中，蒙古族和回、满、达斡尔、鄂温克和鄂伦春族的兄弟民族党员，有三万五千六百九十八名，占全区兄弟民族人口的2.8％，和1954年相比，蒙古族党员增加一点二倍，回族党员增加二点八倍，达斡尔族党员增加八倍。在这些党员中，有去年吸收的新党员一万四千二百九十名，这些都是经过党组织的长期培养教育，特别是经过在整风、生产大跃进、人民公社化等运动中的考验才吸收的。其中，有不少是各民族中的高级知识分子。
    由于党的队伍不断发展壮大，党的组织在各个地区和系统中，均有了相当的基础。现在，绝大多数厂矿、企业、机关、学校和人民公社的管理区（生产大队），都建立了党的基层组织。建党较晚的一百五十三个牧区公社，也都建立了党的基层委员会。
    新华社讯　甘南藏族自治州的七十三个地方国营工矿企业和三十五个人民公社都建立了党的基层组织。全州现有共产党员七千五百六十人，其中藏、回、保安、撒拉等民族的党员一千七百一十五人，占全州党员总人数的22％。
    自去年民主改革以来，甘南党组织发展迅速，全州新接收了大批具有共产主义觉悟的积极分子入党。他们大都出身于牧工和农奴，在民主改革、大炼钢铁和公社化等运动中得到了锻炼。去年，在藏区新建的党支部，比民主改革前增加了一倍半。
    甘南地区党的基层组织充分发挥了堡垒作用。临潭县洮阳公社先锋生产队党支部领导群众积极生产，使“十年九荒”的穷山沟发展成为“生产年年红，生活步步升”的富裕地方。在征服干旱，绿化红枣山和抢修水渠中，党员总是带头战斗在最险要的地段。为了扩大耕地面积，党员鲁宝国、李荣栋带头上山安家落户，在他们的影响下，二十四户贫农也搬进了山。
    新华社拉萨1日电　中国人民解放军西藏军区某营党组织，在“七一”前夕先后接收了二十八名优秀的藏族官兵入党。
    这个营的党组织十分重视培养藏族官兵，经常帮助他们提高阶级觉悟和对党的认识，接收他们中的优秀分子入党。许多汉族干部为了能够直接帮助藏族官兵，都积极地学习藏族语言。
    入党后的藏族官兵，在执行各项任务中，都能以身作则，吃苦在前。一连三排藏族排长杰错在行军中身体不好，副教导员让他骑马，他却把马给有病的战士骑，自己坚持步行。有时，他还帮助体弱的战士背枪，鼓舞战士们前进。他说，我不仅是中国人民解放军的军官，而且是中国共产党的党员，一定要很好地带领全排，完成党交给我们的任务。
    这些藏族共产党员都很关心群众利益，努力开展群众工作。有一次为救济受水灾的群众，他们带头捐献。共产党员旦米切自动把多年积蓄的二百多元津贴费，全部捐献出来。他们还带领战士们冒着生命的危险，抢救落水被淹的藏胞。
    在党的培养和教育下，这些藏族共产党员的阶级觉悟有了很大提高，立场坚定，处处维护党的利益。他们积极宣传党的政策，并且以自己的模范行动带动大家一起进步。
