    Hundred Vegetable Garden
    Han Zi
    This time when I went to the countryside, I really wanted to see an enviable and abundant vegetable garden. Near Xiangshan Temple in Jinzhai, I indeed found it. It belongs to Comrade Li Kaiwen, a veteran Red Army soldier. The diligent hands of this sixty-five-year-old man built this hundred vegetable garden.
    Look, the whole garden is filled with different shades of green, layers of leaves in various shapes, arranged in their own formations, classified according to some unknown knowledge. Here are all kinds of melons, there are different vegetables, and on the other side are bean pods of different sizes, occasionally mixed with one or two peanut or soybean plants, which shows the childlike arrangement of the old man. The corn is the tallest, its saber-like long leaves rustling, and the corn cobs have already grown red tassels. Could it be the commander? The transplanted amaranth is the shortest, but its small stems are also upright. If you're thirsty, pick a cucumber to eat, it's both tender and crisp; the cucumbers that were just picked and sent to us on our way still had the morning dew on them. If you want scallions, there are scallions; if you want garlic, there is garlic. Fresh and tender green peppers will soon be ready to pick. There are also daylilies growing by the water, and wild lilies dug from the mountains. Their slender and elegant appearance surpasses the potted plants in flower shops. Pumpkin vines spread all over the slope, tomatoes and long beans are on the trellis, vines climb and entwine, a scene of lush growth. The hundred vegetable garden is also a hundred flower garden. I don't need to describe the colors of the flowers of the well-known melons and vegetables, they are nothing more than eggplant purple and melon yellow, but when they bloom together, they are also quite charming. The white flowers of the winter melon, seen from a distance, look like small lotus flowers emerging from the water. Beet seeds stretch out jade whips, lettuce seeds form pompoms, daylily seedlings are slender, with flower buds on their heads, very much like night-blooming jasmine, and lilies will soon bloom with white trumpet flowers. …
    Not facing the street nor on flat ground, this more than one mu vegetable garden was only opened up from a twenty-degree hillside in the second half of last year, but now the ridges are neat and tidy, and everything is fresh and clear. "I don't live in the city or on the street, just give me a place surrounded by wasteland, so my hands and feet can be useful." This is the owner's ambition. Even if he has to go up and down half a li to fetch water to water the vegetables, he doesn't care. His experience in growing vegetables is: don't miss the season, don't let weeds grow, don't lack fertilizer, and don't dehydrate. "The land is for growing vegetables, not for growing weeds." He said with a smile. While talking to us, he went to weed, "hum hum" one stroke after another, as if the grass was his enemy. He cultivates it alone, and when there is a harvest, it provides food for his family of six. The staff of the nearby grain station also eat the vegetables he grows. If they want to give him money, he gets angry: "We are all comrades, I feel uneasy taking your money." He is hospitable, and has many guests. Guests who come can eat some of his fresh side dishes.
    This old soldier, barefoot and with a sack around his waist, not only tends a vegetable garden, but this year he has dug out the open spaces on the nearby mountains and hills, and planted a hillside of sesame and a patch of sweet potatoes… It seems that he can be self-sufficient in both oil and grain with a surplus. People often hear him say: "If you want something, don't go to the government or higher authorities, compete with the land god!" This is his simple belief in participating in socialist construction, and his hundred vegetable garden is the flower blooming from his liberated thinking. (Attached picture)

    百菜园
    菡子
    这次到乡下去，我满想看到一个令人羡慕的丰富的菜园。在金寨的响山寺附近，我果真找到了它。它是属于老红军战士李开文同志的，六十五岁老人勤劳的手，建设了这个百菜园。
    看吧，满园绿色都不相同，一层层形状各异的叶子，排成自己的队伍，不知按什么学问分了类。这边是各式的瓜，那边是不同的菜，另一边又是大小不一的豆荚，间或有杂在一起一棵两棵的花生、黄豆，这倒可以看出老人出自童心的安排。玉蜀黍最高，佩刀式的长叶咻咻作响，苞米棒子已经长出红须了，难道它是指挥员么？移栽的苋菜最矮，可它的小茎也是挺挺的，渴了摘根黄瓜吃吧，既嫩且脆；刚摘下送我们上路的黄瓜，还带着早晨的露水。要葱有葱，要蒜有蒜，鲜嫩的青大椒，很快也可以摘了。还有长在水边的金针菜，有从山上挖来的野百合，它们挺秀的模样儿，胜过花店里的盆景。南瓜叶藤漫坡，番茄、长豆上架，牵丝攀藤的，一番茂盛景象。百菜园也是百花园，我不必描写人们熟知的瓜菜的花色，无非是茄紫瓜黄，可是开在一起倒也楚楚可观。冬瓜的一片白花，远远看去，像出水的小荷花似的，甜菜种伸着玉鞭，莴苣种结成绣球，金针菜苗条，头顶着花骨都儿，很像夜来香，百合不久将开白喇叭花儿。……
    不临街也非平地，这一亩多地的菜园去年下半年才从一个二十度的山坡上开辟出来，现在却畦畦平整，眉目清新。“我不住城不住街，给我一块四周有荒地的地方，我的手脚也好有个用处。”这是主人的抱负。那怕要上上下下到半里路以外去担水浇菜，他也不在乎那些。他种菜的经验是：不误时，不长草，不缺肥，不脱水。“地是长菜的，不是长草的。”他笑着说。和我们说着话他就去锄草，“哼哼”一下又一下，就像草是他的仇敌似的。他一个人种，打有收成，就供家里六个人吃，附近的粮站工作人员也吃他种的菜，要给他钱，他就火了：“我们都是同志，拿你一个钱我心里不安。”他好客，客人也多。来的客人都可以吃到他几样新鲜小菜。
    这个赤着脚腰里围着麻袋的老军人，不仅服侍一个菜园，今年他把附近山上山下的空地都挖了出来，种了一山岗的芝麻，一垇子的山芋，……看来油粮都可自给有余。人们常听他说：“你要什么别跟政府、上级去讨，跟土地爷去争嘛！”这是他参加社会主义建设的一条朴素的信念，他的百菜园就是他的思想开放出来的花朵。（附图片）
