    Flue-cured Tobacco and Sun-cured Tobacco
    The tobacco cultivated in our country is generally divided into flue-cured tobacco and sun-cured tobacco. Flue-cured tobacco is the main raw material for the cigarette industry, and cigarettes (paper cigarettes) are made of flue-cured tobacco. Sun-cured tobacco is mostly used for dry tobacco or water pipe tobacco, and some are processed into tobacco replicas. Flue-cured tobacco is not only different from sun-cured tobacco in processing, requiring baking, but also in variety and cultivation techniques.

    In our country, there is also a type of tobacco that is dried by shade-drying, called air-cured tobacco. Air-cured tobacco has a strong aroma and can be used as an aromatic flavoring raw material for cigarettes or as a raw material for pipe tobacco.

    Flue-cured tobacco and sun-cured tobacco are widely distributed in our country. The main producing areas of flue-cured tobacco are Henan, Shandong, Anhui, Guizhou, Yunnan, Liaoning, Jilin and other provinces, among which Henan and Shandong have the largest output. There are not many areas producing air-cured tobacco in our country, only individual areas in Zhejiang and Guangxi.

      Winning Favor with Leaves
    Tobacco belongs to the Solanaceae family and is an annual herb. Although it belongs to the same family as potatoes, eggplants, peppers, and tomatoes, its contribution to people is completely different. Potatoes, etc., provide people with tubers and fruits for consumption; tobacco, however, wins favor with its leaves.

    Tobacco leaves contain some special things: a large amount of carbohydrates, nitrogen compounds, nicotine, tannin, polyphenols, rutin, etc. The carbohydrates in tobacco leaves decompose into sugar under certain conditions. Sugar occupies an important position in tobacco leaves, and its amount is related to the quality of the tobacco. Nicotine stimulates the central nervous system and can make people excited. Tannin, polyphenols, rutin, etc., can emit a fragrant odor when tobacco burns.

      Tobacco Also Has Other Uses
    Tobacco (including flue-cured tobacco and sun-cured tobacco), in addition to making dry tobacco and cigarettes, is also the safest type of pesticide among crop insecticides. The effective component of tobacco insecticide is nicotine. Nicotine has three effects on pests: stomach poison, contact, and fumigation. When sprayed on plants, it can also penetrate into the plant to kill insects.

    Tobacco is also an export commodity with high economic value. Exporting one dan of tobacco leaves can be exchanged for fifteen dan of chemical fertilizers.

    Nicotine, citric acid, malic acid, etc., can also be extracted from tobacco, and these are raw materials for light industry.

    烤烟
    烤烟和晒烟
    我国栽培的烟草，一般分烤烟和晒烟。烤烟是卷烟工业的主要原料，香烟（纸烟）就是用烤烟制成的。晒烟多数作为旱烟或水烟吸用，部分被加工成烟的复制品。烤烟不仅在加工上和晒烟不同，要经过烘烤，就是在品种、栽培技术上，也和晒烟不尽相同。
    我国栽培的烟草还有一种用阴晾法干燥的晾烟。晾烟香味较浓，可以做卷烟的芳香调味原料，也可以做烟斗烟的原料。
    烤烟和晒烟在我国分布都很广泛。烤烟主要产区在河南、山东、安徽、贵州、云南、辽宁、吉林等省，其中以河南、山东产量最多。我国生产晾烟的地区不多，仅浙江、广西的个别地区。
      以叶取宠于人
    烟草属茄科，一年生草本植物。它虽然和马铃薯、茄子、辣椒、西红柿同属一种，但是对人的贡献却完全不同。马铃薯等以块茎、果实供给人们食用；烟草却以叶子取宠于人。
    烟草的叶子里含有一些特殊的东西：大量的碳水化合物、氮化合物、烟碱、丹宁、多酚、芸香甙等。烟叶中的碳水化合物在一定条件下分解为糖。糖在烟叶里占有重要地位，它的多少关系到烟的品质好坏。烟碱就是尼古丁，刺激中枢神经，能使人兴奋。丹宁、多酚、芸香甙等，可以在烟草燃烧时发出芳香气味。
      烟草还有别的用处
    烟草（包括烤烟、晒烟）除了制做旱烟、卷烟以外，也是农作物杀虫药剂中最安全的一种农药。烟草杀虫的有效成分是烟碱（尼古丁）。烟碱对害虫兼有胃毒、接触、熏蒸三种作用，喷在植物上还可以透入植物体内杀虫。
    烟草还是一种经济价值较高的出口物资。出口一担烟叶，可以换回十五担化学肥料。
    从烟草里还可以提取尼古丁、柠檬酸、苹果酸等，这些都是轻工业的原料。
