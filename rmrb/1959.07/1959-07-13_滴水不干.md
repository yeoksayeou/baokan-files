    A Drop Won't Dry Up
    It is said that Shakyamuni once asked his disciples, "How can a drop of water never dry up?" The disciples could not answer, and Shakyamuni said, "Put it into the sea."
    Currently, some young people are always thinking about doing some immortal cause, but what is an immortal cause? The above analogy answers this very well: put one's personal career into the sea of the people's cause. Whether you are a teacher, clerk, worker, or agricultural technician, and any ordinary labor, it is an immortal cause.

    滴水不干
    据说，释迦牟尼曾问过他的弟子：“一滴水怎样才能永远不干枯？”弟子回答不出，释迦牟尼说：“把它放到大海里去。”
    目前有些青年人总是在想干些什么不朽的事业，但怎样才是不朽的事业呢？上面的比喻回答的就很好，把个人的事业放到人民事业的大海里去。无论你是做教师、职员、工人或者是农业技术员，以及任何普通的劳动，都是不朽的事业。
                （姚兆熊）
