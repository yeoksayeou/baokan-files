    Female Office Worker, Nearly Forty
    Swims Thirty Kilometers in Fourteen Hours

    Magda Molnár is already thirty-nine years old. From the age of nineteen until today, she has consistently been at the forefront of women's long-distance swimming competitions in Hungary. In last year's international marathon swimming competition, she swam thirty kilometers in the turbulent sea in thirteen hours and fifty-three minutes, defeating outstanding female swimmers from around the world who were much younger than her.

    Magda Molnár works at the Budapest suburban branch of the Hungarian People's Bank. She loves her work very much, and although she has the right to take some time off work for sports activities, she rarely asks for leave except during competitions. She is already the mother of two children. Some people advised her not to breastfeed her children, fearing it would affect her physical strength, but Magda Molnár did not refuse to fulfill her maternal duties. Just a few months after giving birth to her second child, she won the Balaton Lake swimming competition for the sixth time.

    When asked what the secret to her outstanding achievements was, she replied: "That's because I insist on exercising every day, either swimming or engaging in other sports activities. I walk to work every day, and I do the housework myself. For me, achieving results is not about the moment of the competition, but the daily training." (Attached picture)

    女职员年近四旬
    十四小时游三十公里
    马格达·莫尔纳尔今年已经三十九岁了。从她十九岁那年起直到今天，匈牙利每次举行女子长距离游泳比赛，她总是名列前茅。在去年国际马拉松游泳比赛中，她在波涛滚滚的大海里，以十三小时五十三分钟的时间游了三十公里。战胜了世界上优秀的、比她年轻得多的女游泳家。
    马格达·莫尔纳尔在匈牙利人民银行布达佩斯郊区分行工作。她非常喜爱自己的工作，虽然她有权利占用一些工作时间进行体育活动，但是除了比赛期间外，她从不多请假。她已是两个孩子的母亲了。有人劝她不要给孩子喂奶，怕影响她的体力，但是马格达·莫尔纳尔却没有拒绝做母亲的天职。就在生第二个孩子以后的几个月，她又第六次荣获巴拉顿湖游泳比赛冠军。
    有人问她取得这样优秀的成绩有什么秘诀，她回答说：“那是因为我每天坚持锻炼，不是游泳，就是进行其他体育活动。我每天走着去上班，家务事自己干。对我来讲，取得成绩不在于比赛的时刻，重要的是日常的锻炼。”（附图片）
