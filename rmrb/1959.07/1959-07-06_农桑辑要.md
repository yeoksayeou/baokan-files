    "Essentials of Agriculture and Sericulture"
    Liu Mianzhi

    The "Essentials of Agriculture and Sericulture" in seven volumes, was compiled by the Yuan Dynasty's Department of Agriculture. It has a preface by Wang Pan, a scholar of the Hanlin Academy, dated Guiyou year of the Zhiyuan era of the Yuan Dynasty (1273 AD). This year corresponds to the ninth year of the Xianchun era of Emperor Duzong of the Song Dynasty. In February of that year, Song general Lü Wenhuan defected to the Yuan with Xiangyang. By the thirteenth year of Zhiyuan (1276 AD), Yuan troops entered Lin'an, and in the sixteenth year of Zhiyuan (1279 AD), Lu Xiufu and Zhang Shijie died, marking the end of the Song Dynasty. This book was compiled seven years before the Yuan Dynasty unified Southern Song, but the crops discussed in the book already included Southern crops that Northern agronomists in the past had not clearly understood.

    Emperor Shizu of Yuan established the Department of Agriculture in the seventh year of Zhiyuan (1270 AD). This organization specialized in agriculture, sericulture, and water conservancy. It dispatched agricultural promotion officials to tour prefectures and counties, investigate the success or failure of agricultural affairs, and report the situation to the Ministry of Revenue, which used this information to assess the performance of local officials. According to Wang Pan's preface, after the establishment of the Department of Agriculture, it focused on promoting agriculture and sericulture, and after five or six years, the effects were significant. The area of cultivated land and planting by the people increased several times over the previous amount, showing great results. Officials of the Department of Agriculture saw that although farmers had practical production experience, their methods of "sowing and planting, and the processes of silkworm raising" might not be very effective, resulting in "laborious work with little gain, and meager harvests." They extensively sought out and consulted agricultural books from ancient and modern times, removed the cumbersome parts, selected the essential points, and compiled the "Essentials of Agriculture and Sericulture." This is a book summarizing agricultural experience before the 13th century, and also a book disseminating agricultural experience from the North and South.

    This book was highly valued at the time. After it was published in the Zhiyuan era, Emperor Renzong ordered it to be printed in the Jiangzhe Province in the first year of the Yanyou era (1314 AD). Later, Emperors Yingzong, Mingzong, and Wenzong repeatedly ordered its distribution. In the third year of Zhishun (1332 AD), 10,000 copies were printed. The current popular edition was compiled from the "Yongle Encyclopedia" by the compilers of the Siku Quanshu in the thirty-eighth year of the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty (1773 AD). Ji Yun's annotation: "Observing its extensive selection from classics, histories, and various philosophical works, supplemented by experimental methods, thorough investigation and consideration, and everything being practical, it was extremely valued at the time, and not without reason." His evaluation is also very high.

    The seven volumes cover classics and instructions, cultivation, sowing, mulberry planting, silkworm raising, melons and vegetables, fruits, bamboo and wood, medicinal herbs, and animal husbandry. Among them, mulberry planting and silkworm raising each occupy one volume, hence the name of the book is "Essentials of Agriculture and Sericulture."

    The books cited mainly include the "Important Arts for the People," as well as the "Book of Fan Shengzhi," the "Monthly Commands of Cui Shi," etc. In addition to the books already cited in "Important Arts for the People," the main new additions include "Essential for Farmers," "New Book for Attending to Fundamentals," "Extensive Records of Seasonal Times," "Essentials of the Four Seasons," "Illustrated Classics," "Han Minzhi's Sayings," "Records of Extensive Knowledge," "Direct Sayings on Planting," "Direct Sayings on Sericulture," and "Silkworm Classic," etc.

    Compared with the "Important Arts for the People," besides a large amount of material added on mulberry and silkworms, new additions include methods for planting ramie, methods for planting cotton, discussions of ramie and cotton, watermelon, planting radish, spinach, lettuce, garland chrysanthemum, amaranth, chard, ginkgo, orange, tangerine, hawthorn, lacquer, soapberry, chinaberry, Chinese toon, reeds, cattails, gardenia, tea, yam, wolfberry, chrysanthemum, Atractylodes lancea, Polygonatum sibiricum, lily, burdock, cassia seed, sugarcane, Job's tears, wisteria, mint, poppy, beekeeping, etc. Among these, although the "Important Arts for the People" had records of crops like cotton, tea, and sugarcane, they were very brief because Jia Sixie did not understand the situation in the South. He had not seen these crops, let alone had planting experience, so he could only rely on hearsay and records, and of course, could not describe them in detail. The "Essentials of Agriculture and Sericulture" is different. It specifically discusses the sowing, watering, topping, cotton picking, ginning, and spinning of cotton; the collection of tea seeds, fertilizers, sowing, and harvesting seasons; and the sowing, watering, harvesting, cellaring, and boiling methods of sugarcane. By comparing and carefully reading these two books, one can clearly see the historical process of the development of agricultural crop varieties and the improvement of technology in our country.

    The "Essentials of Agriculture and Sericulture" is a practical book that not only played a beneficial role in the time and subsequent eras, but also influenced neighboring countries. Korea is one example.

    The method of silkworm raising in Korea was introduced from China. The Annals of King Taejong of the Joseon Dynasty record that in 1417 AD, Gyeonggi Regional Governor Kwon Sae presented yellow real silk and cocoons. Previously, Yi Haeng, the Grand Scholar of the Office of Royal Decrees, extracted the method of silkworm raising from the "Essentials of Agriculture and Sericulture," and gained experience himself. His harvest was more than double the usual, and he had the method printed and distributed to the world. Later, the Korean government, fearing that the people would not understand Chinese, ordered Guo Cunzhong, a secretary of the State Council, to annotate each section with vernacular language and print and distribute it widely.

    For example, regarding the method of collecting grain seeds, the Annals of King Sejong of the Joseon Dynasty record that in August of 1422 AD, Right State Councillor Yi Won, Councillor Heo Chu, etc. reported that the "Essentials of Agriculture and Sericulture" had methods for collecting grain seeds, including old and large two-row barley. An old farmer also said that he had tried planting three-year-old barley, and the yield was no different from new barley seeds. The people might not know this, and this year there is a shortage of two-row barley seeds, so all officials should provide old barley from their granaries to be used as seeds. Regarding the method of planting buckwheat, in May of the same year, the Ministry of Revenue was ordered to inform each province to encourage the planting of buckwheat, referring to the "Essentials of Agriculture and Sericulture," the "Four Seasons Compilation," and the local experience methods, and to encourage planting in a timely manner. Regarding the planting of rice, in 1438 AD, the provincial governors were ordered to follow the instructions in the "Essentials of Agriculture and Sericulture" to encourage the people to plant early and not miss the season.

    Furthermore, regarding the planting of safflower, the Annals of King Sejo of the Joseon Dynasty record that in 1462 AD, an order was issued to the provincial observers saying: "Safflower can be planted in both spring and summer. Our people only know about spring planting but not summer planting. Now, a copy of the method of planting safflower from the 'Essentials of Agriculture and Sericulture' is sent to you. You should inform the people and let them know the benefits of both types of planting."

    农桑辑要
    刘勉之
    农桑辑要七卷，元司农司撰。有元至元癸酉（公元一二七三）翰林学士王磐序。这一年是宋度宗咸淳九年，这年二月，宋将吕文焕以襄阳叛降于元。到至元十三年（公元一二七六）元兵入临安，十六年（公元一二七九）陆秀夫张世杰死，宋亡。这书的编成在元统一南宋之前七年，但是书里所讲的农作物，已经包括了过去北方的农学家所讲不清楚的南方作物了。
    元世祖于至元七年（公元一二七○）设司农司，这个机关专管农桑水利，分别派遣劝农官，巡行郡邑，察举农事成否，把情况通知户部，据以考核地方官的治绩。据王磐序说，从司农司成立以后，专门劝课农桑，行之五六年，功效大著，民间垦辟种艺之业，增前数倍，成绩很大。司农司的官员看到农民虽然有实际生产经验，但是“播殖之宜，蚕缲之节”也许不很得法，“力劳而功寡，获约而不丰”，就遍求古今所有农家的书，披阅参考，删其繁重，摭其切要，编为农桑辑要。这是一部总结十三世纪以前农业经验的书，也是传播南北各地农业经验的书。
    这书在当时很被重视。在至元时代刊行以后，仁宗延祐元年（公元一三一四）又特命刊板于江浙行省，以后英宗、明宗、文宗都一再申命颁布。至顺三年（公元一三三二）还印行了一万部。现在的通行本是清乾隆三十八年（公元一七七三）四库馆臣从永乐大典辑出来的。纪昀的案语：“观其博采经史及诸子杂家，益以试验之法，考核详瞻，而一一切于实用，当时绝贵重之，不虚也。”评价也很高。
    七卷的内容是典训、耕垦、播种、栽桑、养蚕、瓜菜、果实、竹木、药草、孳畜。其中栽桑、养蚕，各占一卷，所以书名就叫作农桑辑要。
    引用的书主要的是齐民要术，以及氾胜之书、崔寔月令等。齐民要术已经引用过的书以外，新加的主要有士农必用，务本新书，岁时广记，四时类要，图经，韩民直说，博闻录，种莳直说，蚕桑直说，蚕经等书。
    内容和齐民要术相比，除桑、蚕增加了大量材料以外，新添的有栽种苧麻法，栽木棉法，论苧麻木棉，西瓜，种萝卜，菠薐，莴苣，同蒿，人苋，莙薘，银杏，橙，橘，楂子，漆，皂荚，楝，椿，苇，蒲，栀子，茶，薯蓣，枸杞，菊花，苍术，黄精，百合，牛蒡子，决明，甘蔗，薏苡，藤花，薄荷，罂粟，养蜂等等。其中如木棉，茶，甘蔗，齐民要术虽然有了记载，但是很简略，因为贾思勰不了解南方情况，这些作物没有看到过，更谈不上种植经验，只能凭传闻和记载，当然不可能说得很具体。农桑辑要便不同了，具体地谈到棉花的下种，浇水，打心，摘棉，去子，拈棉，茶的收种子，肥料，下种，收茶时节，甘蔗的下种，浇水，和收割，窖藏以及煎熬之法等等。把这两部书比较细读，很可以看出我国农业作物的品种发展，技术提高的历史过程。
    农桑辑要是一部切于实用的书，不止在当时和以后的时代起了有益的作用，连邻近的国家也受到影响，朝鲜就是一个例子。
    朝鲜养蚕的方法是从中国传去的，李朝太宗实录记公元一四一七年京畿采访判官权宷进黄真丝与茧。以前艺文馆大提学李行于农桑辑要内抽出养蚕方，自为经验，所收倍常，把方子刊板行世。后来朝鲜政府怕民间不懂华语，又命议政府舍人郭存中将本国俚语逐节夹注，刻板广布。
    如收谷种法，李朝世宗实录记公元一四二二年八月，右议政李原，参赞许稠等启，农桑辑要收谷种法，有陈大小二麦。又老农云，尝种陈三年麦，结实与新麦种无异。民未必晓此，今年二麦种乏，令各官廩有陈麦者悉给为种。种荞麦法，同年五月，令户曹行移各道，荞麦耕种，考农桑辑要，四时纂要及本国经验方，趁时劝种。如种水稻，公元一四三八年令诸道监司，依农桑辑要所示，劝民早种，毋致失时。
    又如种植红花，李朝世祖实录记，公元一四六二年下令各道观察使说：“红花春夏皆可种。我国人但知春种而不知夏种。今抄农桑辑要种红花法送之，宜晓谕民间，使知两种之利。”
