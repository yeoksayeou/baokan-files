How to Grow More and Better Chinese Cabbage
Director of the Vegetable Cultivation Teaching and Research Group, Beijing Agricultural University, Lu Zihao

In order to increase the supply of vegetables this winter and next spring, the planting area for Chinese cabbage (hereinafter referred to as cabbage) this autumn needs to be greatly expanded. To accomplish this task, it is necessary to solve problems such as labor shortages, seed shortages, and insufficient fertilizer.

Staggered Use of Labor

The labor required for cabbage, from land preparation and sowing to harvesting, is relatively high among autumn vegetables, requiring approximately twenty-five labor days per mu, half of which are concentrated in the initial twenty-odd days for land preparation, application of base fertilizer, ridge making, sowing, thinning, and setting seedlings. Moreover, the period before and after cabbage sowing in the north coincides with the rainy season, further intensifying the land preparation and sowing work. This situation is even more pronounced in areas where summer crops are harvested relatively late. Therefore, how to rationally allocate labor, timely complete land preparation and sowing, and manage subsequent tasks has become a primary issue in cabbage production.

According to the experience of Fengtai District, Beijing, in recent years, promoting high-ridge direct seeding, seedling transplantation, and “false mother-child seedling” planting methods has had a significant effect on staggering the use of labor, shortening sowing and planting dates, and timely completing management tasks. The so-called "false mother-child seedling" planting is a good cultivation experience created by farmers in Beijing. Like general seedling transplantation, it involves seedling cultivation first. The difference is that seedlings are transplanted early, when they have one to two true leaves. Seedlings are not thinned during cultivation; when uprooting, a clump of soil is dug out with every three to five seedlings. After planting, the seedlings are thinned twice, the first time selecting two strong seedlings, and the second time leaving one strong seedling. The advantage of this method is that uprooting is done when the seedlings are small, causing less root damage, thus "recovering" faster than planting larger seedlings, with fewer diseases, and higher yields.

By adopting these three cultivation methods, Fengtai District rationally staggered the use of labor for planting cabbage, timely completed land preparation, sowing, transplanting, and other field management tasks, thereby ensuring the stability of cabbage yields.

Reform Tools, Improve Efficiency

Since 1955, the suburbs of Beijing have combined the adoption of labor model Shen Duo's high-ridge direct seeding experience and vigorously promoted animal-powered farm tools. According to the usage evidence in various places, using hoes, walking plows, three-pronged cultivators, and shovel tools to make high ridges is more than 4.5 times more efficient than manual labor. This spring, the Vegetable Experiment Station of Beijing Agricultural University trialed using tractors to pull five-row or seven-row ridging machines, creating furrows or high ridges on approximately 200 mu per day, several dozen times more efficient than manual labor. Using three-pronged cultivators for cabbage inter-tillage, weeding, topdressing, and earthing up can also improve work efficiency to varying degrees. In terms of leveling land, the Vegetable Experiment Station of Beijing Agricultural University trialed wooden frame leveling harrows, which, when pulled by two horses, can level more than 50 mu of land per day. The vegetable group has also begun to trial hand-pushed seeders for cabbage sowing. Through the above-mentioned tool reforms, the labor required for cabbage production has been greatly reduced, ensuring the timely execution of field operations.

Timely Sowing

In the north, especially in areas with relatively short growing seasons, the suitable sowing period for cabbage is only three to five days. If the sowing time is delayed, the cabbage will be small and the head will not be tight due to the shortened growing season. Vegetable farmers attach great importance to timely sowing, saying, "One day of late sowing for cabbage is equivalent to a ten-day difference."

Sowing cabbage too early is also not good. According to a survey of soft rot disease in the cabbage production area of Xushui County, Hebei Province, in 1958, the earlier the sowing, the earlier and more severe the disease onset. The incidence of cabbage mosaic virus and downy mildew is the same as soft rot. It was also generally observed during the major epidemic of three major cabbage diseases in 1958 that early-sown diseases were more serious than late-sown diseases. Therefore, in the current situation where cabbage diseases cannot be eradicated, strictly controlling the cabbage sowing period is very necessary. Each cabbage producing area should sow in a timely manner according to the local accumulated sowing experience, neither delaying the sowing time nor blindly advancing it.

Rational Use of Chemical Fertilizers

Due to the expansion of cabbage planting areas, the demand for fertilizers has increased. How to rationally use fertilizers is also an important issue in this year's cabbage production. Here are some suggestions regarding ammonium sulfate, the most widely used fertilizer in cabbage production.

The application of ammonium sulfate to cabbage must be timely. According to experiments, the yield-increasing effect of ammonium sulfate varies greatly depending on the time of application.

| Time of Ammonium Sulfate Application | Amount of Cabbage Increased per Jin of Ammonium Sulfate Applied (Jin) |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Applied before sowing                 | 23.4                                                            |
| Applied 20 days after sowing          | 21.6                                                            |
| Applied 40 days after sowing          | 21.8                                                            |
| Applied 60 days after sowing          | 8.0                                                             |
| Applied 80 days after sowing          | 6.5                                                             |
| Control (no ammonium sulfate applied) | 0                                                               |

Note: All of the above treatments received base fertilizer, and the application rate of ammonium sulfate was 45 jin per mu, applied once.

From the table above, it can be seen that the later the ammonium sulfate is applied, the worse its yield-increasing effect. By the sixtieth day, that is, applied in early October, the effect is very small. According to the cabbage high-yield experience in Qianjiang, Hubei in 1957 and the cabbage high-yield experience in Xushui in 1958, adding a small amount of fast-acting ammonium sulfate to the base fertilizer can make the seedlings grow strongly and have a yield-increasing effect.

Why is it that the earlier the application of ammonium sulfate starts, from before sowing, the better the yield-increasing effect, and the later the application, the worse the effect? This is because the base fertilizer generally consists of slow-acting organic fertilizers that decompose slowly and are difficult for seedlings to absorb. However, cabbage seedlings need the necessary nutrients early on (the nutrients in the seeds themselves are almost completely depleted by the time the true leaves appear). Therefore, appropriately adding a small amount of ammonium sulfate to the base fertilizer (applied together with the banded base fertilizer before sowing, avoiding contact with the seeds) can promote seedling development, which is also very beneficial for the next stage of growth. The poor effect of applying ammonium sulfate later in the growth period is because the temperature decreases and the duration of sunshine also decreases during the later stages of cabbage growth, thus reducing photosynthesis, so growth gradually slows down and fertilizer absorption capacity also decreases.

The amount of fertilizer applied each time also affects the yield-increasing effect of cabbage. From the overall fertilization situation, it is best to apply ammonium sulfate lightly during the seedling stage and more heavily during the peak growth period. This can promote the growth of the outer leaves as much as possible, laying a good foundation for heading.

Impact of Climatic Conditions

Climatic conditions have a great impact on cabbage yield. From the comparison of cabbage yields in the experiment fields of Beijing Agricultural University in 1956 and 1957, it can be seen that the average yield per mu differed by more than 6,000 jin in the two years. The main reason for this situation is the influence of climate. The factors affecting climate are mainly rainfall, temperature, and sunlight. In late July and early August, when cabbage land is prepared, ridged, and sown, it is the rainy season in the north. The amount of rainfall and the number of consecutive days of rain each year during this period will affect the timely sowing of cabbage.

The growth of cabbage seedlings is closely related to temperature and humidity. After cabbage seedlings are set, they enter a period of rapid growth of outer leaves. If they encounter continuous rainy weather, it is also unfavorable to cabbage growth. The heading period is already after the Autumnal Equinox. During this stage, the sunshine gradually shortens and the weather turns cold. The main impact on cabbage during this period is the drop in temperature.

We must have a sufficient understanding of the favorable and unfavorable climatic factors in cabbage production, because only in this way can we better formulate corresponding agricultural technical measures.

Conserving Seeds

This year, the cabbage planting area in various places has increased significantly, and seed production is far from meeting the needs. Therefore, the rational use of seeds is also a matter that should be paid attention to in this year's cabbage production. The cabbage sowing period is during the hot and rainy season, with many diseases and insect pests. Although sparse sowing can save seeds, emergence is often uneven, and seedlings are easily missing. The two sowing methods currently adopted by most units have their own advantages and disadvantages. For example, row sowing uses more seeds, but the advantage is that it is easy to protect seedlings. Spot sowing saves nearly half the seeds compared to row sowing, but the seedlings grow crowdedly, which is not conducive to seedling growth. The broken row sowing method (poke sowing) adopted by the Sijiqing Commune in Beijing is relatively good. Sowing in this way uses fewer seeds per mu than row sowing, while also easily protecting seedlings. Adopting seedling transplantation can also save many seeds.

    怎样把大白菜种得又多又好
    北京农业大学蔬菜栽培教研组主任　陆子豪
    为了增加今冬明春的蔬菜供应，今年秋季大白菜（以下简称白菜）种植面积需要扩大很多。完成这项任务，必须解决劳力紧张、种子缺少和肥料不足等问题。
    排开使用劳动力
    白菜从整地、播种到收获所花费的劳力在秋菜中是比较多的，每亩地大约需要二十五个劳动工日，其中一半集中在整地、施基肥、作畦、播种、间苗到定苗的最初二十多天里。再加北方白菜播种前后正值雨季，使整地和播种工作更形紧张。这种情况在夏季作物拉秧比较晚的地区更为突出。因此，如何合理安排劳动力，及时完成整地、播种以及以后管理工作，就成为白菜生产中的一个首要问题。
    根据北京市丰台区这几年的经验，推广高畦直播，育苗移栽和栽假子母秧三种方式，对排开使用劳动力，缩短播种、栽植日期和及时完成管理工作，都有极显著的效果。所谓“栽假子母秧”，是北京市农民创造的一种很好的栽培经验，它和一般育苗移栽一样，先行育苗，所不同者只是提早在幼苗一至二片真叶的时候就起出定植，育苗时不间苗，起苗时每三至五株幼苗挖一土团，栽植后再间苗两次，第一次选留二株壮苗，第二次留一株壮苗。这一方法的优点是在小苗时起苗，伤根较少，因而比栽大苗“缓苗”快，病害也较少，产量较高。
    丰台区采用这三种栽培方法，合理地排开种植白菜的劳动力，及时地完成白菜的整地、播种、定植以及其它田间管理工作，从而保证了白菜产量的稳定。改革工具，提高工效
    北京市郊结合采用劳动模范申多的高畦直播的丰产经验，在1955年开始大力推广畜力农具。据各地使用证明，用耠子、步犁、三齿耘锄铲趟器等农具作高畦（高垅），比人工提高效率四点五倍以上。今春北京农业大学蔬菜试验站试用拖拉机拖带五行或七行培土器，每天开沟或作高畦约二百亩左右，比人工提高效率几十倍。在白菜的中耕、除草、追肥和培土中，使用三齿耘锄，也能不同程度地提高工效。在平整土地方面，北京农业大学蔬菜试验站，试用的木框平地耙，用双马曳引每天可以平地五十亩以上。蔬菜组在白菜播种方面还开始试用手推播种机。通过以上的农具改革，大大减少了白菜生产中所需要的劳动力，保证了田间操作的及时进行。
      适期播种
    在北方，尤其是生长期比较短的地区，白菜的适宜播种期只有三、五天，如果延误播种时间，白菜就会因生长期缩短而株小、包心不紧。菜农很重视播种适时，他们说：“白菜晚播一天，差十天。”
    白菜播种太早也不好。根据1958年河北省徐水县白菜产区软腐病的调查说明，播种越早者发病越早越重。白菜毒病和霜霉病发病情况和软腐病一样。在1958年白菜三大病害大流行中也普遍看出，早播的病害比迟播的更为严重。因此，在目前还不能根除白菜病害的情况下，严格地控制白菜播种期很有必要。各白菜产区，应该按照当地多年积累的播种经验适时播种，既不可延误播种时间，也不能盲目提前。
  合理使用化学肥料
    由于白菜种植面积扩大，肥料的需要量增加，如何合理使用肥料也是今年白菜生产中的一个重要问题。现就白菜生产中使用最多的硫酸铵提出一些意见。
    给白菜施用硫酸铵必须适时。根据试验，由于施用时期不同，硫酸铵的增产效果有很大差异。硫酸铵施入时期施入每一斤增产白菜的数量（斤）
  播种前施入23.4
  播种后二十天施入21.6
  播种后四十天施入21.8
  播种后六十天施入8.0
  播种后八十天施入6.5对照（不施硫酸铵）0
    注：上项各种处理方法都施有基肥，硫酸铵每亩施用量四十五斤，一次施入。
    由上表可以看出，硫酸铵施入越晚，其增产效果越差，到第六十天，也就是在10月上旬施入，效果就很微小了。根据1957年湖北潜江白菜丰产经验和1958年徐水白菜的丰产经验，在基肥中加少量速效性硫酸铵，能使幼苗生长健壮，有增产作用。
    为什么从播种前就开始施用硫酸铵的增产效果最好，晚施效果就不好呢？这是因为基肥中一般都是迟效性的有机肥料，分解较慢，幼苗难于吸收，可是白菜幼苗早期就需要应有的养分（种籽本身养分，一到真叶出现就几乎消耗完了），所以在基肥中适当加用少量硫酸铵
  （在播种前与条施基肥一起施入，避免与种籽接触），能促进幼苗发育，对下一阶段生长也极有利。硫酸铵在后期施入效果差，是由于白菜生长后期温度下降，光照时数也减少，因而光合作用减弱，所以生长逐渐缓慢，吸肥能力也降低。
    每次施肥的数量不同，对于白菜增产的效果也有所不同。从整个施肥情况来看，施用硫酸铵最好是苗期轻一点，进入生长盛期重一些，这样可以促使外叶尽可能的生长，为包心打下良好基础。
  气候条件的影响
    气候条件不同对于白菜产量有很大影响。从北京农业大学蔬菜试验站1956年和1957年白菜试验地的产量比较可以看出，两年每亩平均产量相差六千多斤。造成这种情况的主要原因就是气候的影响。气候影响的因素主要是降雨、温度和光照。在7月下旬和8月上旬，白菜整地、作畦、播种的时候，正值北方雨季，每年这个时期降雨的多少和连续的日数，都会影响白菜的及时播种。
    白菜幼苗的生长同温度和湿度有密切的关系。白菜定苗后，进入外叶急速生长时期，如果遇到连绵阴雨，对白菜生长也是不利的。进入包心期，已是“秋分”以后。这一阶段，日照逐渐缩短，天气转寒。这个时期对白菜的影响主要是温度下降。
    我们对于白菜生产中的气候上的有利因素和不利因素要有足够的认识，因为这样才能更好地制定相应的农业技术措施。
      节约种籽
    今年各地白菜播种面积增加很多，种籽的生产远不能满足需要。因此合理利用种籽，也是今年白菜生产中一个应该注意的事项。白菜播种时期正值高温多雨季节，病虫害较多，播种过稀，虽然可以节约用种，但出苗往往不齐，容易缺苗。目前多数单位采用的两种播种办法各有利弊。例如条播费种较多，但好处是容易保苗。点播比条播省种近半，但是幼苗生长拥挤，对于幼苗生长不利。北京市四季青社采用的断条播种法（戳垵播）是比较好的。这样播，每亩用种量较条播省，同时也易保苗。采用育苗移栽的方式也可以节约很多种籽。
