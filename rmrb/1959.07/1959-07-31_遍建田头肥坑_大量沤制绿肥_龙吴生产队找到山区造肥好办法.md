Building Fertilizer Pits Throughout the Fields  Massively Composting Green Manure
Longwu Production Team Finds a Good Way to Make Fertilizer in Mountainous Areas

(Reported by this newspaper) The Longwu Production Team of Qingshui People's Commune in Yong'an County, Fujian, based on the characteristics of mountain fields, has established permanent field-side fertilizer pits, combining year-round fertilizer accumulation with crash campaigns. This year, the more than one hundred new field-side fertilizer pits in the team have already accumulated more than 22,000 dan of high-quality composted fertilizer, accounting for half of the total fertilizer accumulated in the first half of the year. The amount of fertilizer applied has increased by 70% compared to last year, playing an important role in promoting a bumper harvest in agriculture.

This team is located in an extremely remote mountainous area with many fields and few people. Each able-bodied worker has to cultivate twenty-five mu, and cultivation has always been very extensive, especially with severe fertilizer shortages. Some distant fields receive no fertilizer at all. During the Great Leap Forward last year, the commune members displayed soaring enthusiasm and worked hard, but even then, the average application was only fourteen dan per mu. This spring, Bian Qi, the First Secretary of the Yong'an County Party Committee, came here to inspect the work and discovered this problem. He suggested that they dig compost pits at the edge of the fields to accumulate fertilizer on the spot and apply it on the spot. The Longwu Brigade Party Branch, based on Bian Qi's suggestion and after summarizing and promoting the experience of the Wu Jiao Production Team in increasing production by using three-in-one soil to build field-side fertilizer pits for composting fertilizer last year, organized the following: Last summer, this production team dug two field-side fertilizer pits in Tubao, which were made of three-in-one soil (lime, sand, and mud), with thatched sheds above to shield from the rain. The quality of the composted fertilizer was very good. The Party Branch organized all cadres, Party members, League members, and activists to visit the Wu Jiao Production Team, which further increased everyone's confidence and further recognized the role of field-side fertilizer pits in increasing production. On the basis of ideological mobilization, Branch Secretary Zhang Zhenzhi and the team leader and other cadres went to survey the land and made unified plans for the location of the fertilizer pits, and also set the specifications and quality standards for the fertilizer pits. Then, the cadres, Party members, and League members divided up the work to mobilize the masses, set quality, quantity, and time limits for completion. The branch secretary and team leader took the lead, and the entire team mobilized more than 130 people to build 120 field-side fertilizer pits, scattered among the 2,300 mu of mountain fields and terraced fields, averaging one fertilizer pit for every nineteen mu of fields. After inspection and acceptance, these fertilizer pits all met the specifications and standards.

The Longwu Production Team's method of building field-side fertilizer pits is as follows: Dig a four-foot-wide and six-foot-deep earthen pit on the slightly higher corner of the field, compact it with three-in-one soil mixed with one hundred catties of lime and two hundred catties of sand, and then build an "A"-shaped thatched shed on top to protect it from wind and rain. Each field-side fertilizer pit is filled with more than ten dan of green grass and tender leaves, two to three hundred catties of cow dung, one hundred catties of lime, and an appropriate amount of water. It is stirred every five to ten days. After thirty to forty days, sixty to seventy dan of high-quality composted fertilizer can be obtained.

Practice has proven that field-side fertilizer pits are indeed an effective way to fundamentally solve the problem of insufficient fertilizer in mountain fields, and are a fast, economical, and efficient method of accumulating and making fertilizer in mountainous areas. The local people have summarized four major benefits of field-side fertilizer pits: First, taking materials locally. The materials for building fertilizer pits, such as lime, sand, thatch, etc., do not cost a penny. Four people can build one in a day, and the quality of the built fertilizer pit is good and will not leak. The main raw material for composting fertilizer, green grass and tender leaves, is abundant in the mountains and inexhaustible. Second, accumulating and manufacturing on the spot, applying on the spot, and saving labor. According to statistics, the entire team composted more than 20,000 dan of fertilizer this year, saving 500 labor days just on transporting fertilizer. Third, convenient fertilizer application, which facilitates the combination of year-round fertilizer accumulation and crash campaigns. The water in the mountainous areas is cold, and green manure directly applied to the fields has a slow effect, often failing to meet the needs of crop growth in a timely manner. Accumulating other mountain fertilizers such as wood ash and burnt soil is also subject to weather restrictions. The fertilizer composted in the field-side fertilizer pits decomposes quickly, has a fast fertilizer effect, and can be taken and used at any time. The masses call it a "fertilizer warehouse." Fourth, high fertilizer quality and great production increase. Generally, wild green manures contain organic acids that are harmful to crop growth. However, green manure composted with lime, cow dung, etc., undergoes chemical decomposition, and the organic acid components that are harmful to crops are greatly reduced. Therefore, the fertilizer effect is much greater than that of ordinary green manure. According to experimental comparisons, one dan of this composted fertilizer is equivalent to one dan of human urine or five catties of fertilizer powder. This year, the rice fields that have received more composted fertilizer from field-side fertilizer pits are growing particularly well. For example, the Qingshui Agricultural School in this team dug ten fertilizer pits around more than forty mu of rice fields, applying fertilizer in stages twelve times per mu, applying nearly one hundred dan of composted fertilizer. The more than forty mu of early rice are growing very strong, with long ears and many grains, and full grains. It is now about to be harvested. According to old farmers, it is estimated that at least 800 catties of grain can be harvested per mu, an increase of one and a half times compared to last year. This team recently extracted more than forty laborers to specialize in burning lime and preparing to build another three hundred and twenty field-side fertilizer pits in the fall, so that there is an average of one permanent field-side fertilizer pit for every five mu of field.

### 遍建田头肥坑  大量沤制绿肥  龙吴生产队找到山区造肥好办法

    遍建田头肥坑  大量沤制绿肥
    龙吴生产队找到山区造肥好办法
    本报讯　福建永安县青水人民公社龙吴大队根据山田特点，建立永久性的田头肥坑，做到常年积肥与突击积肥相结合。今年全队新建的一百多个田头肥坑，已积造了二万二千多担优质沤肥，占上半年总积肥量的一半，施肥量比去年增加了70％，对促进农业大丰收起着重要作用。
    这个大队处在极端偏僻的山区，田多人少，每个整劳动力要负担耕种二十五亩，耕作历来都很粗放，特别是施肥严重不足，有些远田根本没有施肥。在去年大跃进中，社员发挥了冲天干劲，苦干猛干，平均每亩也才施肥十四担。今年春天，中共永安县委第一书记边圻同志来到这里检查工作，发现了这个问题，便建议他们在田边挖沤肥坑，就地积肥、就地施用。龙吴大队党支部根据边圻同志的建议，并总结和推广了吴教生产队去年用三合土打田头肥坑沤肥获得增产的经验：这个生产队去年夏季在土堡地方挖了两个田头肥坑，是三合土
  （石灰、砂、泥）打成的，上有茅棚遮雨，沤积的肥料质量很好。党支部组织全体干部和党团员、积极分子到吴教生产队参观访问，更加提高了大家的信心，进一步认识到田头肥坑对增产的作用。在思想发动的基础上，支部书记张振枝和大队长等干部分头察勘土地，对肥坑的设置地点作统一规划，肥坑的规格质量标准也作了规定。接着干部、党团员划片包干发动群众，定质、定量、定时完成，支部书记、大队长都带头动手，全队出动一百三十多人，兴建起一百二十个田头肥坑，星罗棋布在二千三百亩的山垅田和梯田之中，平均十九亩田就有一个肥坑。经过检查验收，这些肥坑都符合规格标准。
    龙吴大队田头肥坑的做法是：在稍高的田边角上挖一个阔四尺、深六尺的土坑，用一百斤石灰、二百斤砂土拌成的三合土打实，上面再搭上“入”字形的茅棚挡风遮雨。每个田头肥坑放进十多担青草嫩叶，二、三百斤牛粪，一百斤石灰，灌上适量的水，每隔五至十天搅拌一次。经过三十至四十天就可以取得六十担至七十担质量很好的沤肥。
    实践证明，田头肥坑确是从根本上解决山田施肥不足的有效途径，是山区积肥造肥的一种多快好省的办法。当地群众总结田头肥坑有四大好处：第一，就地取材。建肥坑的器材：石灰、砂土、茅草等都不用花一文钱，四个人一天可建一个，打的肥坑质量好，不会渗漏；沤肥的主要原料青草嫩叶满山都是，取之不尽。第二，就地积造、就地施用、节省劳力。据统计，全大队今年沤肥二万多担，光运肥就节省了五百个劳动日。第三，用肥便利，便于做到常年积肥与突击积肥相结合。山区水冷，绿肥直接下田肥效迟，往往不能及时满足作物生长的需要。积其他山肥如草木灰、火烧土等还要受到天气的限制。田头肥坑沤的肥料腐熟很快，肥效快，贮在肥坑里随时可以取用。群众称它是“肥料仓库”。第四，肥料质量高，增产效果大。一般野生绿肥都含有对作物生长不利的有机酸。但用石灰、牛粪等沤熟的绿肥，经过化学分解，对作物有害的有机酸成份便大大下降。因此肥效比一般绿肥大很多。根据试验对比，这种沤肥一担可抵得上人尿一担或肥田粉五斤。今年凡是施用田头肥坑沤肥较多的稻子都长得格外好。例如这队青水农业学校在四十多亩稻田周围挖了十个肥坑，每亩分期施肥十二次，施下近百担沤肥。四十多亩早稻都长得非常粗壮、穗长粒多、籽粒饱满，现在即将收割。据老农估计，至少每亩可收八百斤谷，比去年增产一倍半。这个大队最近抽出四十多个劳力专门烧石灰、准备秋后再建田头肥坑三百二十个，做到平均五亩田有一个永久性的田头肥坑。（附图片）
