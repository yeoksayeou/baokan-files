The cook of the Xingxing Mess Hall of the Guoqing Production Team in the suburban commune of Liuyang County, Hunan Province, Xiao Guidong, upon seeing that the team had a lot of fields but few laborers at the start of the "Double Rush" season, voluntarily proposed that one of the cooks be extracted to participate in the "Double Rush", and that she alone would cook. The team agreed to this idea and decided that she would continue to be responsible for the cooking work. From then on, her enthusiasm was even greater. Every day, she got up before dawn, rinsed the rice clean, cooked it thoroughly, and steamed it well. A few minutes before mealtime, she weighed out each person's ration, one by one, and cooled it. The meals for fifty people, three times a day, were all done this way. She paid attention to both freshness and taste in the dishes, and tried to vary them as much as possible. For example, in the morning they would eat pumpkin, water spinach, and peppers; at noon they would eat loofah, bitter gourd, and pickled vegetables, with both dry and soup dishes, and the flavors were suitable. There was always tea available, and she also sought out some local herbs to brew into herbal tea, which she delivered to the fields to quench the thirst and relieve the heat for the commune members.

She arranged her time very well, preparing tea and meals during the day, and taking advantage of the evenings to carry water and prepare vegetables... often, when others were asleep, she was still busy.

Everyone lived well, which had a certain impetus on production. Commune member Zhou Pu said: "The three meals and tea are eaten comfortably, and when it comes to production, I am full of energy. With a good 'housekeeper,' it doesn't matter if I do three or four more points of work a day."

    一个好“内当家”
    湖南浏阳县城郊公社国庆生产队星星食堂的炊事员萧桂冬，“双抢”一开始，她看到队里田多劳力少，自动提出抽出一个炊事员参加“双抢”，由一人作饭。队里同意了这个意见，决定由她继续担任炊事工作。从此，她的干劲更足了。每天天还不亮就起床，把米淘洗干净，煮熟蒸好，在开饭前几分钟按各人定量一份份秤好滩凉；五十人的菜饭，一日三餐都是这样。吃的菜既注意新鲜，又注意口味，并且尽可能调剂开来吃。比方早晨吃南瓜、瓮菜、辣椒；中午就吃丝瓜、苦瓜和酸菜等，干汤搭配，咸淡适合。茶水经常不缺，还寻了一些土药煎成凉茶，送到田间，让社员止渴解暑。
    她把时间安排得很好，白天搞茶饭，利用晚上挑水，准备些菜……，往往人家睡了，她还在忙着。
    大家生活得好，对生产起了一定的推动作用。社员周普说：三餐茶饭吃得舒舒服服，搞起生产来一身是劲。有了个好“内当家”，一天多做三、四分不打紧。
