    儿歌选小蜻蜓，小蜻蜓，飞来飞去不消停，小朋友们别捉它，它帮咱们捉蚊蝇。
            （子良）
  小白杨小白杨，小白杨，宝宝爱它像爱糖，日夜浇水三四趟，天天盼望快快长。小白杨，小白杨，宝宝积肥不会忘；明年夏天树下坐，唱着山歌乘风凉。
              （江苏）要做灭蚊小英雄细纱布，白绒绒，哥哥剪，妹妹缝，做成网兜像灯笼，随时随地拿手中，要做灭蚊小英雄。
              （蚌埠）
  不倒翁说你呆，你不呆，胡子一大把，样子像小孩。说你呆，你不呆，把你一推你一歪，要你睡下去，你又站起来。
    看外婆豌豆花，角对角，打打扮扮看外婆，走一弯，又一弯，不见舅家在那边，新洋房，一大片，外婆搬进居民点。
            （李孑夬）
    萤火虫萤火虫，你快落，落在地上我来捉；把你带到我家去，看看我们的好生活：我家装了新电灯，保管比你亮得多。
            （刘屏藩）
