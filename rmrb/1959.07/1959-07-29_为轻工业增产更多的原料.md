To increase the production of more and better raw materials for light industry, and to promote the faster development of China's light industry, is an important and glorious task for the agricultural front.

The speed of development of light industry is directly related to the lives of every person in the country. People's needs in life are complex and diverse. But in summary, there are only two aspects: material life and cultural life. Material life includes all kinds of materials for eating, clothing, and using, among which, besides eating things like grains that can be directly taken from agricultural production, clothing and using materials are mostly light industrial products. Even the food we eat has a lot that comes from light industries such as the food industry and brewing industry. Cultural life may seem to have no direct relationship with light industry on the surface, but that is not the case. We need to study, read books, watch plays, and watch movies, but learning cannot be done without books, paper, pens, and ink. Plays and movies cannot be separated from clothing, props, cosmetics, and so on. In this way, all the means of livelihood of the people, except for the part directly obtained from agricultural production, are obtained from light industrial production. This simple fact clearly shows us that striving to develop light industry is a very important condition for making our lives more convenient, better, and richer. The speed and quality of the development of light industry is a decisive factor in improving and raising people's living standards. This is the first point. Secondly, the faster development of light industry is also closely related to the country's socialist construction. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have repeatedly and clearly pointed out that the fundamental task of the people of the whole country is to build our country into a modern socialist industrialized country as soon as possible. The smooth realization of the national industrialization task requires many conditions, one of which is the issue of funds. With sufficient funds, we can build more factories and open more mines, and we can make our country's industrialization cause progress faster. Where does the money come from? It mainly relies on the accumulation of our own people. Light industry accumulates funds the most and the fastest. According to the actual experience since the founding of the country, building a textile factory, a cigarette factory, and other light industrial factories can bring back all the investment in one or two years in most cases, and in half a year or several months in the least. In other words, after only about a year, it can accumulate construction funds for the country in multiples.

Therefore, whether it is from the perspective of better improving the lives of the people across the country and better meeting the needs of the people, or from the perspective of accumulating more funds for the country, accelerating the country's socialist construction, and accelerating the speed of industrialization, we should make our country's light industry develop faster, more, and better. How can we make our country's light industry develop faster? Improving business management and improving the labor productivity of all employees are all very important conditions. In this regard, the vast number of employees on the light industry front have done a very good job this year. In the first half of the year, the total output value has increased by 30% compared with the same period last year, and it is continuing to increase. The problem that must be solved at present is to make further efforts to overcome the contradiction that the production of raw materials cannot keep up with the needs of the development of light industry production, and to accelerate the development of light industry production. In order to solve the contradiction between light industry production and supply, and to produce more and better light industrial products with the same amount of raw materials, the workers are doing everything possible to save the use of raw materials. However, simply relying on savings cannot fundamentally solve the raw material problem. The most important thing is to vigorously open up sources, and the agricultural front, the people's communes in the countryside, must increase the production of more raw materials for light industry. 60% of China's light industry raw materials come from agriculture: cotton, wool, silk, and hemp fibers used in the textile industry come from agricultural production; sugar beets and sugar cane used in the sugar industry come from agricultural production; flue-cured tobacco used in the cigarette industry, grains and fruits used in the brewing industry, wood, bamboo, reeds, rice straw, etc. used in the paper industry also come from agriculture; other raw materials such as food and canning industry, leather industry, etc., all come from agricultural production. Therefore, whether the agricultural front can produce more raw materials for light industry and whether it can supply light industry with more raw materials has become a decisive factor in whether light industry can develop faster.

The agricultural front increasing the production of more raw materials for light industry, and the people's communes better developing the production of raw materials for light industry, is not only good for the development of the country's light industry, but also good for improving the lives of the people across the country, and also very good for the people's communes. Developing the production of raw material crops for light industry can greatly increase the income of communes and members, thereby greatly promoting the overall development of the commune economy and the further improvement of the lives of members. According to investigations by relevant departments, the income of raw material crops for light industry is more than twice that of general crops. As for wild raw material crops for light industry, such as wild medicinal materials, wild hemp, and many by-products of forests, as long as labor can be properly arranged and a part of the people are assigned to collect them in the mountains and forests, it will be a great wealth.

Can the people's communes produce more and better raw material crops for light industry while vigorously developing food crops? Yes, and the conditions are very good. The people's communes are large in scale, have strong manpower, and are rich in material resources. Many communes are "full of talents" and "have mountains and waters," possessing the conditions for the all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery. As long as we greatly strengthen subjective efforts, the increase in the production of raw material crops for light industry will definitely be achieved. The key now is to establish a comprehensive view of developing production, and to seize the current summer and autumn seasons, which determine the increase in agricultural production for the whole year, and vigorously engage in diversified operations. The so-called comprehensive view of developing production is to not only do a good job in grain production, but also do a good job in diversified operations; that is, according to the specific conditions of the commune and production team, properly arrange manpower and material resources, and develop those diversified economies that can be developed very well. The so-called seizing the opportunity is to specifically organize forces to carefully manage the raw material crops for light industry that have already been operated, such as hemp, tobacco, sugar cane, sugar beets, etc., hoe the weeds that should be hoeed, top-dress the fertilizer that should be top-dressed, and try every means to strive for higher yields; that is, to collect the wild raw material crops for light industry that should be collected now, such as wild medicinal materials, wild hemp, and various mountain goods such as wood ear, shiitake mushrooms, peach kernels, apricot kernels, Torreya nuts, hazelnuts, etc., in a timely manner; that is, to make good material preparations and organizational preparations for all harvesting and processing to ensure a bumper harvest.

Diversified economies include a wide range of aspects, and there are many varieties of raw material crops for light industry. Which aspects of production should the people's communes in various places mainly develop? From a national perspective, the vast majority of people's communes should focus on the development of animal husbandry; focus on the production of sugar crops such as sugar cane and sugar beets; focus on the production of flue-cured tobacco, hemp, tea, and silkworm crops. Developing animal husbandry can not only increase the production of non-staple foods, but also provide more hides and wool for the country's leather and textile industries, and can also provide livestock power and accumulate a large amount of fertilizer for agricultural production. It is a good thing that kills three birds with one stone. Now is the summer and autumn breeding season for large livestock and pigs and sheep. All localities should do a good job in breeding and strive for full conception. In order to ensure the smooth development of animal husbandry, the people's communes should organize forces to cut green grass in large quantities and use crop straws to make silage feed. Sugar cane, sugar beets, flue-cured tobacco, jute, tea, and silkworm are raw materials for light industry that are urgently needed for people's lives and national construction. These crops are currently in the peak growing season. If managed well, they can increase the yield per unit area. The people's communes that have planted these crops should organize forces well and must manage them well and strive for a bumper harvest. From a specific regional perspective, the party committees and people's communes in various places should develop diversified operations and develop the production of raw material crops for light industry in accordance with their own characteristics and local conditions. For example, mountainous areas can develop mountain product production, medicinal material production, and woody oil production such as oil tea, walnuts, tung oil, and pepper; they can develop rosin, shellac, beeswax, lacquer, and gallnut production; and coastal and lakeside areas can vigorously develop fishery production. Aquatic products such as prawns, fish, and seaweed are not only good raw materials for the food industry, but also important raw materials for oil refining, glue making, and the chemical industry.

In order to ensure the continued great leap forward of major autumn crops such as grain, cotton, and oil, and also to increase the production of more raw materials for light industry, the party committees and people's communes at all levels should do a good job in political and ideological work for the members, explaining the benefits of comprehensive economic development to the country, to the commune, and to the members. Then, on the basis of improving the understanding of the masses, formulate a production plan for the comprehensive development of production, the development of cash crops, and the development of diversified operations, and properly arrange manpower and material resources to ensure the realization of the plan. At the same time, we must earnestly help the communes and production teams with difficulties solve specific difficulties such as seeds, funds, tools, and materials necessary for production. Cash crops and raw material crops for light industry are all technical crops, and they are generally more technical. The leadership should strengthen technical guidance. To give full play to the business enthusiasm of the vast number of members, on the one hand, rely on political and ideological education, and on the other hand, correctly implement the party's policies. In the development of diversified operations, we must resolutely implement the principle of distribution according to work, conscientiously implement the system of equal pay for equal work, more pay for more work, and bonus rewards; for some small-scale crops that are easy for members' families to manage, members should be allowed to operate privately; under the principle of not affecting collective production, the small-scale sideline occupations that members operate in their spare time should resolutely implement the policy of personal income. Doing a good job in the supply of materials necessary for production and the purchase of products is an important condition for the development of cash crops and raw material crops for light industry. The economic departments, especially the commercial departments, should do everything possible to supply the communes with the pesticides, fertilizers, tools and other materials necessary for production in a timely manner, and adopt various methods to facilitate the masses and the communes to sell products, such as signing contracts and purchasing door-to-door. In the purchasing work, we must conscientiously implement the policy of pricing according to quality and superior price for superior quality. If there are unreasonable phenomena in the purchase price of individual products, appropriate adjustments should be made in a timely manner. In addition, holding a good material exchange meeting, enlivening the rural primary market, and doing a good job in short-distance transportation to ensure the timely transfer of goods are all very important. All localities must make practical arrangements to ensure that they are done well.

Now is the key season to determine the increase in agricultural production this year, and it is also the best season to develop diversified operations and increase the production of raw material crops for light industry. As long as we seize the opportunity, widely mobilize the masses, and correctly arrange the production of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, we will be fully able to greatly strengthen the field management of major autumn crops such as grain, cotton, and oil, and at the same time develop diversified operations very well, and we can increase the production of more raw materials for light industry and increase more income for the people's communes.

    为轻工业增产更多的原料
    为轻工业增产更多更好的原料，促使我国的轻工业更迅速地向前发展，是农业战线一个重要而光荣的任务。
    轻工业发展的快慢，直接关系着全国每一个人的生活。人们的生活需要是复杂多样的。但是归纳起来，不外物质生活和文化生活两个方面。物质生活包括吃的、穿的、用的各种物资，其中除了吃的如粮食等可以直接取自农业生产而外，穿的和用的大都是轻工业产品。就是吃的也有不少是从食品工业、酿造工业等等轻工业生产中得来的。文化生活外表看起来好像同轻工业没有直接关系，其实不然，我们要学习、要看书、看戏、看电影，但学习不能没有书，不能没有纸、笔、墨水，戏和电影也离不开服装、道具、化装品等等。这样看来，人们的生活资料，除了直接由农业生产中得到的部分以外，全部是由轻工业生产中取得的。这个简单的事实就向我们明白地表明：努力发展轻工业，是使我们生活得更方便，更美好，更丰富多采的一个很重要的条件。轻工业发展得快慢好坏，是改善和提高人民生活的一个决定性的因素，这是一。其次，更快地发展轻工业，还与国家的社会主义建设有十分密切的关系。党中央和毛泽东同志曾经一再明确地指出：全国人民的根本任务是把我国尽快地建设成为一个现代化的社会主义工业化的国家。国家工业化任务的顺利实现，需要很多条件，其中一个很重要的条件是资金问题。有充足的资金，我们就可以多建工厂、多开矿山，就能够使我国工业化事业进展得更快些。资金从哪里来呢？主要靠我国人民自己积累。而轻工业是积累资金最多最快的。据建国以来的实际经验，举办一个纺织厂、卷烟厂以及别的轻工业工厂，多者一年两年，少者半年几个月，就能够把投资全部拿回来，换句话说，只需经过一年左右的时间之后，就可以为国家积累成倍成倍的建设资金。
    因此，无论是从更好地改善全国人民生活，更好地满足人民的需要方面看，或是从为国家积累更多的资金，加快国家的社会主义建设、加快工业化的速度方面看，我们都应该使我国的轻工业发展得更快、更多、更好。怎样才能使我国的轻工业发展得更快些呢？改善经营管理，提高全体职工的劳动生产率等等，都是很重要的条件。这方面轻工业战线上的广大职工，今年作得很好，上半年已经使生产总值比去年同期增长了30％，而且还在继续提高。目前必须解决的问题是要作进一步的努力，克服原料生产赶不上轻工业生产发展需要的矛盾，使轻工业生产加速发展。为了解决轻工业生产和供应之间的矛盾，为了用同样多的原料生产出更多、更好的轻工业产品，工人同志们正在千方百计地节约使用原材料。然而仅仅靠节约是不能从根本上解决原料问题的，最主要的是大力开源，必须由农业战线，由农村的人民公社增产更多的轻工业原料。我国的轻工业原料有60％来自农业：纺织工业用的棉花、羊毛、蚕丝以及麻纤维等来自农业生产；制糖工业用的甜菜、甘蔗来自农业生产；卷烟工业用的烤烟，酿造工业用的粮食、水果，造纸工业用的木材、竹子、芦苇、稻草等等，也是来自农业；其他如食品和罐头工业、制革工业，等等，其原料莫不来自农业生产。因此，农业战线能不能生产更多的轻工业原料，能不能供给轻工业更多的原料，就成为轻工业能不能更快发展的一个决定性的因素了。
    农业战线为轻工业增产更多的原料，人民公社更好地发展轻工业原料的生产，不仅对发展国家的轻工业有好处，不仅对改善全国人民的生活有好处，对人民公社也有很大的好处。发展轻工业原料作物的生产，可以大大增加公社和社员的收入，从而大大促进公社经济的全面发展和社员生活的进一步提高。据有关部门调查：轻工业原料作物的收入比一般作物高一倍以上。至于野生的轻工业原料作物，如野生药材，野生麻类，森林的许多副产品等等，只要能适当安排劳动力，分出一部分人到山上、森林里去采集，就是一笔很大的财富。
    人民公社在大力发展粮食作物同时，能不能把轻工业原料作物的生产搞得更多更好些呢？能够，而且条件好得很。人民公社规模大，人力雄厚、物质资源丰富。许多公社都是“人材济济”、“有山有水”，具备了农、林、牧、副、渔全面发展的条件。只要大大加强主观的努力，轻工业原料作物的增产就一定能够实现。现在的关键是要树立发展生产的全面观点，并紧紧抓住当前这个决定全年农业增产的夏、秋季节，大搞多种经营。所谓发展生产的全面观点，就是既要搞好粮食生产，也要搞好多种经营；就是根据本公社、本生产队的具体条件，适当地安排人力、物力，把那些能够发展的多种经济很好地发展起来。所谓抓住时机，就是要具体地组织力量，把已经经营起来的轻工业原料作物如麻、烟、甘蔗、甜菜等等认真管理好，该锄草的锄草，该追肥的追肥，想尽一切办法争取更高的产量；就是把现在应该采集的野生轻工业原料作物如野生药材、野生麻类以及各种山货如木耳、香菇、桃仁、杏核、香榧、榛子等等，及时地采集回来；就是作好一切收获和加工的物质准备和组织准备，保证丰产丰收。
    多种经济包括的方面很广，轻工业原料作物的品种很多，各地人民公社应该主要的发展哪些方面的生产呢？从全国来说，绝大多数人民公社都应该抓紧畜牧业的发展；抓紧甘蔗、甜菜等糖料作物的生产；抓紧烤烟、麻类、茶叶、蚕桑作物的生产。发展畜牧业不仅可以增产副食品，不仅可以为国家的制革工业、纺织工业提供更多的皮张和绒毛，还可以为农业生产提供畜力和积造大量的肥料，是一举三得的好事。现在，正是大牲畜和猪羊的夏秋配种时期，各地要做好配种工作，力争满怀。为了畜牧业的顺利发展，各人民公社应该组织力量，大量采割青草，并利用作物秸秆大搞青贮饲料。甘蔗、甜菜、烤烟、黄麻、茶叶、蚕桑等，是人民生活和国家建设迫切需要的轻工业原料，这些作物目前正在生长的旺季，管理得好，能够增加单位面积产量。种有这些作物的人民公社，应该很好地组织力量，一定要把它们管好，争取大丰收。从具体地区来说，各地党委和人民公社应该根据自己的特点，因地制宜地开展多种经营，发展轻工业原料作物生产。比如山区，可以发展山货生产、药材生产和木本油料如油茶、核桃、油桐、花椒等的生产；可以发展松香、紫胶、白蜡、漆、五倍子等生产；而靠海、沿湖地区则可大力发展渔业生产，对虾、鱼类、海藻等水产品，不仅是食品工业很好的原料，也是炼油、制胶、化学工业的重要原料。
    为了保证粮、棉、油等大秋作物继续大跃进，同时也为轻工业增产更多的原料，各级党委和人民公社应该很好地对社员进行政治思想工作，说明全面发展经济对国家、对公社、对社员的好处。然后在群众提高认识的基础上，制定全面发展生产、发展经济作物和开展多种经营的生产规划，并恰当地安排人力和物力，保证规划的实现。同时，还要切实地帮助有困难的公社、生产队解决种子、资金、工具以及生产所必需的物资等具体困难。经济作物、轻工业原料作物都是技术作物，技术性一般比较强，领导上应该加强技术指导。发挥广大社员的经营积极性，一方面靠政治思想教育工作，同时也靠正确地贯彻执行党的方针政策。在开展多种经营中，要坚决贯彻按劳分配的原则，认真实行同工同酬、多劳多得、超额奖励的制度；对于一些便于社员家庭经营的小宗作物，应该允许社员私人经营；在不影响集体生产原则下，社员利用业余时间经营的小副业，应当坚决执行收益归个人的方针。作好生产所必需的物资供应工作和产品收购工作是发展经济作物、轻工业原料作物的重要条件，各经济部门特别是商业部门，应该千方百计及时供应公社生产上必需的农药、肥料、工具及其他物资，并且采取如订立合同、上门采购等便利群众和公社出售产品的各种办法进行收购。在收购工作中，必须认真执行按质论价、优质优价政策。个别产品收购价格如有不合理的现象，应该及时进行适当调整。另外，开好物资交流会，活跃农村初级市场，作好短途运输工作，保证商品及时调运等等，都是十分重要的，各地务必切实安排，保证作好。
    现在，正是决定今年农业增产的关键季节，也是开展多种经营、增产轻工业原料作物的最好季节。只要我们抓紧时机，广泛发动群众，正确安排农、林、牧、副、渔五业的生产，我们就完全能够在大大加强粮食、棉花、油料等大秋作物田间管理的同时，把多种经营很好地开展起来，就可以为轻工业增产更多的原料，为人民公社增加更多的收入。
