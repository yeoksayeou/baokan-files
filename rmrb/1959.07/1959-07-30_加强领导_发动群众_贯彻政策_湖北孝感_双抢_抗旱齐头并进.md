Xiaogan, Hubei, Advances Simultaneously in "Double搶" and Drought Resistance

(Our newspaper's Hankou, July 29th dispatch) Reporter Hai Bo's commentary: Currently, drought is severe in some areas of Hubei Province, and summer agricultural work has entered a busy stage. Is it possible, with a shortage of labor, to both manage "Double搶" well and manage drought resistance well? The experience of Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, shows that this is entirely possible. The key lies in strengthening the Party's leadership, fully mobilizing the masses, and thoroughly implementing the Party's policies.

Xiaogan County is one of the rice-producing areas of Hubei Province. The county has more than 750,000 mu of rice this year, of which more than 380,000 mu of early rice has been harvested with a bumper yield, and the rest is mostly late rice. From mid-July to the end of July, it is the busy season for rushing to harvest early rice and rush to plant late rice. Currently, the county has not had rain for nearly a month, and more than 300,000 mu of autumn crops are suffering from drought and urgently need to be rescued. However, there are fewer than 300,000 laborers in the county. Under normal circumstances, it would be very difficult to manage these three tasks at the same time. However, they have successfully solved this problem. In the "Double搶," they managed to harvest as they ripened and plant as they harvested; they have also made great achievements in drought resistance. As of the 24th, 150,000 mu of fields had been irrigated.

In order to successfully complete the arduous task of "Double搶" and drought resistance going hand in hand, the Xiaogan County Committee of the Communist Party of China has particularly strengthened its leadership this year. Before the start of the "Double搶," the County Committee issued instructions, criticizing some people's erroneous idea of "emphasizing early rice and neglecting late rice," establishing the idea of striving for an all-round bumper harvest, and requiring all localities to fully prepare for the "Double搶" and carefully make overall arrangements (including crops, tasks, labor, life, time, and other aspects). At the same time, many communes and production teams have established "Double搶" and drought resistance headquarters, headed by the main cadres. The specific working method of the headquarters is that cadres participate in production and lead production, and go wherever there are difficulties. Therefore, they can discover and solve problems in a timely manner. The cadres of the Changfeng Production Team of Pengxing Commune, led by Guan Musheng, a famous national model worker who is known for participating in production and leading production, promptly solved the problem of reasonable division of labor and the midday rest of the commune members while working with the commune members. The masses were very happy and discussed: "With such cadres as leaders, any difficulty can be overcome."

The second characteristic of Xiaogan County's "Double搶" this year is to fully mobilize the masses and decide on various measures according to local conditions. In the "Double搶" and drought resistance, many communes and production teams have put forward difficult problems for the masses to discuss, and many problems that were originally considered difficult to solve have been solved in a timely manner. The cadres of the Xialin Production Team of the Baisha People's Commune originally planned to harvest 60 mu of early rice and plant 40 mu of double-cropping rice in the "Double搶," but labor and water sources could not be solved. After handing it over to the masses for discussion, they immediately found many new water sources, adjusted the crop area according to local conditions, and rationally distributed the labor force. As a result, both the "Double搶" and drought resistance were done very well. Resolutely implementing the policy of more work, more gain is another important experience of Xiaogan County in improving the enthusiasm of the masses for labor production this year. To this end, various localities have generally implemented the method of small-scale contracting and the system of overtime rewards. After implementing these methods, the attendance rate in most areas reached 100%, and labor efficiency was also greatly improved.

At present, Xiaogan County's "Double搶" is nearing its end, and the broad masses are fully transferring to the fight against drought under the inspiration of the victory of the "Double搶." More than 100,000 people in the county are participating in the fight against drought, and they are full of confidence in striving for a greater bumper harvest in late rice production.

    加强领导  发动群众  贯彻政策
    湖北孝感“双抢”抗旱齐头并进
    本报汉口29日电　记者海波述评：目前湖北部分地区旱象严重，夏季农活又进入大忙阶段，是否能在劳力不足的情况下，既搞好“双抢”，又搞好抗旱？湖北省孝感县的经验说明：这是完全可能的。问题的关键在于加强党的领导，充分发动群众，彻底贯彻党的政策。
    孝感县是湖北省的产稻区之一，全县今年水稻面积共七十五万多亩，其中早稻三十八万多亩已经丰收，其余大部是晚稻。7月中旬到7月底这段时间，正是抢割早稻、抢插晚稻的紧张季节。目前，全县将近一个月没有下雨，三十多万亩晚秋作物受旱，急待抢救。而全县劳动力还不到三十万个，按照一般情况，要同时抢住这三头活路是十分困难的。但是，他们顺利地解决了这个问题。在“双抢”中作到了熟一块割一块，割一块插一块；抗旱也有很大成绩，截至24日，已有十五万亩田得到灌溉。
    为了胜利完成“双抢”和抗旱双管齐下这个艰巨的任务，中共孝感县委今年特别加强了领导，在“双抢”开始前，县委就发出了指示，批判了某些人的“重早稻轻晚稻”的错误想法，树立了争取全面丰收的思想，要求各地充分作好“双抢”准备，认真进行全面安排（包括作物、活路、劳力、生活、时间等各方面）。同时，很多公社和生产队都成立了“双抢”抗旱指挥部，由主要干部挂帅。指挥部的具体工作方法是干部参加生产领导生产，哪里有困难就到哪里去。因此，能及时发现问题解决问题。以参加生产领导生产著名的全国劳模官木生为首的朋兴公社长风生产队“双抢”指挥部的干部们，在和社员一起劳动中，及时解决了合理分工和社员的午间休息问题，群众十分高兴，纷纷议论：“有这样的干部作领导，什么困难也能克服”。
    孝感县今年“双抢”的第二个特点是充分发动群众，因地制宜地决定各种措施。在“双抢”和抗旱中，很多公社和生产队都把困难问题摆出来，交给群众讨论，很多原来认为很难解决的问题都及时解决了。白沙人民公社夏林生产队的干部，原计划在“双抢”中割六十亩早稻，插四十亩双季稻，但劳力和水源都没法解决。交给群众讨论后，立即找到了很多新水源，因地制宜地调整了作物面积，把劳动力进行了合理分配，结果“双抢”抗旱都作得很出色。坚决贯彻执行多劳多得的政策，是孝感县今年提高群众劳动生产积极性的又一重要经验。为此，各地普遍实行了小包工的方法和超工奖励的制度。实行了这些办法后，大部地区出勤率达到100％，劳动效率也提高很多。
    目前，孝感县“双抢”已接近尾声，广大群众正在“双抢”胜利的鼓舞下，全力转入抗旱斗争。全县参加抗旱斗争的人达十万以上，他们正满怀信心地争取晚稻生产的更大丰收。（附图片）
