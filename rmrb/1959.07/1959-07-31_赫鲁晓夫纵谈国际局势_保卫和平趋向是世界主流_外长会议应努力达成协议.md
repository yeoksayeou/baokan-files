Xinhua News Agency, July 30th: According to TASS, "Pravda" published on July 30th Khrushchev's speech at the mass rally of working people held at the Dnepropetrovsk Machine-Building Plant on the 28th. Khrushchev is currently inspecting the Ukrainian Republic.

At this mass rally, Khrushchev said that we believe the domestic situation in the Soviet Union is very good. The Soviet people have made tremendous achievements in all sectors of the national economy. He said that even those who are hostile to the Soviet Union are now forced to admit that our people are united, they work in a friendly and diligent manner, and smoothly implement their magnificent plans. Everyone can now see that the material welfare of the Soviet people is increasing day by day.

Khrushchev then spoke about the international situation. He pointed out that everyone is concerned about whether lasting world peace can be guaranteed and whether humanity will once again be plunged into a new vortex of war. He said that the Soviet government is making every effort to prevent war. We believe that the barometer does not currently indicate any signs of war. In all countries of the world, the trend of defending peace is the mainstream.

Khrushchev spoke about the content of his conversation with US Vice President Nixon. Khrushchev pointed out that Nixon mentioned in the conversation that he himself advocated peace.

Khrushchev then said, I asked Mr. Nixon: Since you advocate peace, then why did you make such an unreasonable decision to hold the so-called "Captive Nations Week"? Do you really think that the people of socialist countries are captive people?

Khrushchev said that since the people of the Soviet Union and the United States both advocate peace, then why can't we reach an agreement on improving relations between our two countries to consolidate world peace?

Khrushchev pointed out that in his conversation with the Vice President, he pointed out that the policy of peaceful coexistence and the policy of guaranteeing peace between the people of all countries is the only rational policy. He said, let us debate who can better guarantee the material and spiritual wealth of the people, socialism or capitalism. Khrushchev said, your system has existed for hundreds of years. You have been free from colonial dependence for more than one hundred and eighty years, while our Soviet state has only been established for forty-two years. But we are now close behind you, which means that our system guarantees faster development of society along the road of progress.

Khrushchev emphasized that he still believes that US military bases on other countries' territories will one day be dismantled.

Regarding the issue of the revival of West German militarism, Khrushchev said that we are not afraid of Adenauer's bellicose remarks. The international situation has changed unfavorably for German militarism. There are currently two independent Germanys: the peace-loving German Democratic Republic and West Germany, where revanchists and militarists are increasingly raising their heads. Japan is also not the same. Italy, where fascism once brought much suffering to the people, has also undergone tremendous changes. Khrushchev emphasized that the powerful socialist camp is growing stronger and more consolidated.

Khrushchev pointed out that, however, a conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States is possible due to the adventurous activities of West German revanchists. And in such a conflict, millions of people may die. Khrushchev said that I have frankly told Mr. Nixon our opinions about all this.

Khrushchev said to Nixon that if West German militarists launch a war, then the Soviet Union will retaliate and can destroy West Germany and other countries with military bases against the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact countries in a few hours.

Khrushchev then said, we know that if a war breaks out, then we will also suffer great losses in such a war. War will not benefit anyone, so we are unswervingly fighting for peace and for the peaceful coexistence of countries with different political and social systems.

Khrushchev said that in resolving ideological issues, one must never rely on guns; what is needed here is reason, and the need to prove to the people which ideology is correct and which ideology is incorrect.

Khrushchev condemned the morals and style of American newspapers. He pointed out that when the Soviet exhibition opened in New York, Soviet newspapers published the full texts of the speeches of Soviet Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Kozlov and US Vice President Nixon at the opening ceremony. However, American newspapers did not publish the full text of Khrushchev's speech at the opening ceremony of the American exhibition in Moscow, while Soviet newspapers once again published Nixon's speech in full this time.

Khrushchev then said that he and Nixon had a conversation in the television studio of the American exhibition in Moscow, and this conversation was filmed. Khrushchev said that we had agreed that our conversation could only be broadcast on television stations in the United States and the Soviet Union after my speech had been translated into English and Nixon's speech had been translated into Russian. Khrushchev pointed out that the Soviet side fully honored this agreement, but the Americans did not fulfill their promise. "American Broadcasting Corporation" broadcast many of Khrushchev's speeches of principled significance in television programs, but did not translate them into English. Khrushchev pointed out that, as a result, the vast majority of viewers who saw this television broadcast had a misunderstanding of my conversation with Mr. Nixon.

Speaking about the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, Khrushchev emphasized that if all participants in the conference show a rational attitude towards the matter, then the success of the conference will undoubtedly be guaranteed.

Khrushchev said that we believe that the time has come for the leaders of governments to undertake arduous work. It is hoped that the foreign ministers will make another effort to seek mutually acceptable solutions and reach agreements on issues that they can agree on. And let the heads of government study the remaining most difficult principled issues. Khrushchev emphasized that we hope to reach agreements on many contentious issues and be able to guarantee peace.

Khrushchev expressed his belief that President Eisenhower will strive to reach a mutual understanding with the Soviet Union and will do his best to prevent the outbreak of a new war.

Khrushchev concluded by saying that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government believe that a situation has now formed in which the imperialists may not dare to launch a war against our country and against the socialist countries. Our strength and the strength of our socialist allies are strong, and it seems that the West now understands this as well.

    赫鲁晓夫纵谈国际局势
    保卫和平趋向是世界主流
    外长会议应努力达成协议
    新华社30日讯　据塔斯社报道：“真理报”在30日刊登了赫鲁晓夫28日在第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克机器制造厂举行的劳动人民群众大会上的讲话。目前，赫鲁晓夫正在乌克兰共和国视察。
    赫鲁晓夫在这次群众大会上说，我们认为，苏联的国内情况非常好。苏联人民在国民经济各部门中都取得了巨大的成就。他说，现在就连对苏联怀着敌意的人都不得不承认，我国人民是团结一致的，他们友好和勤勉地工作着，顺利地执行着自己的宏伟计划。现在大家都看到，苏联人的物质福利与日俱增。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到了国际局势问题。他指出，大家都很关心世界持久和平能否有保障、人类是否会再度卷入新战争旋涡的问题。他说，苏联政府尽一切努力防止战争。我们认为，晴雨表现在没有表明要发生战争的迹象。在世界各国，保卫和平的趋向是主流。
    赫鲁晓夫谈到了他同美国副总统尼克松谈话的内容，赫鲁晓夫指出，尼克松在谈话中曾经提到过他本人主张和平。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，我问过尼克松先生：既然你们主张和平，那末你们为什么要作出举行所谓“被奴役国家周”这种无理的决定呢？莫非你们真的认为社会主义国家的人民是被奴役的人民吗？
    赫鲁晓夫说，既然苏美两国人民都主张和平，那末我们为什么不能就改善我们两国的关系达成协议，以利于巩固世界和平呢。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，在同副总统交谈时，他曾指出和平共处的政策、保证各国人民之间和平的政策是唯一理智的政策。他说，让我们辩论辩论，谁更能保证人们的物质财富和精神财富，是社会主义还是资本主义。赫鲁晓夫说，你们的制度已经存在了几百年。你们摆脱殖民地从属地位已经一百八十多年了，而我们苏维埃国家才建国四十二年。可是我们现在已经紧跟在你们后头了，这就是说，我们的制度保证社会沿着进步道路得到更快的发展。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，他仍然认为，美国在别国领土上的军事基地总有一天会被取消。
    关于西德军国主义复活的问题，赫鲁晓夫说，我们不害怕阿登纳的好战言论。国际局势发生了不利于德国军国主义的变化。目前存在着两个独立的德国：爱好和平的德意志民主共和国和复仇主义分子及军国主义分子日益抬头的西德。日本也不是原样了。法西斯的统治曾经给人民带来很多灾难的意大利也发生了巨大的变化。赫鲁晓夫强调指出，强大的社会主义阵营日益壮大和巩固。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，但是由于西德复仇主义者的冒险活动，苏联和美国可能发生冲突。而在这种冲突中可能有千百万人死亡。赫鲁晓夫说，关于这一切，我已经开诚布公地把我们的意见告诉了尼克松先生。
    赫鲁晓夫对尼克松说，如果西德军国主义者发动战争，那么苏联进行回击，在几小时内就可以把西德和设有军事基地反对苏联和华沙条约国家的其他国家消灭掉。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，我们知道，如果一旦爆发战争，那么在这样的战争中我们也将蒙受很大的损失。战争对任何人都不会有好处，因此，我们不屈不挠地为争取和平、争取政治制度和社会制度不同的国家和平共处而斗争。
    赫鲁晓夫说，在解决意识形态问题时，绝不能靠枪炮行事；这里需要理智，需要向人民证明，哪种意识形态是正确的，哪种意识形态是不正确的。
    赫鲁晓夫谴责了美国报纸的道德和作风。他指出，苏联展览会在纽约开幕时，苏联报纸全文刊载了苏联部长会议副主席科兹洛夫和美国副总统尼克松在开幕式上的讲话。然而美国报纸却没有刊载赫鲁晓夫在莫斯科的美国展览会开幕式上讲话的全文，而苏联报纸这一次又全文刊载了尼克松的讲话。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，他和尼克松在莫斯科的美国展览会电视室里曾经有过一次谈话，这次谈话的情况被拍成了电影。赫鲁晓夫说，我们曾商定，只有当我的讲话译成了英文，尼克松的讲话译成了俄文以后，我们的这次谈话才能在美国和苏联的电视台上放送。赫鲁晓夫指出，苏联方面完全信守这一约定，而美国人却没有履行自己的诺言。“美国广播公司”在电视节目中放送了赫鲁晓夫的许多具有原则意义的讲话，但是没有译成英文。赫鲁晓夫指出，这样一来，看到这种电视广播的绝大多数观众对我同尼克松先生的谈话就产生了误解。
    在谈到日内瓦外长会议时，赫鲁晓夫着重指出，如果会议的所有参加者都对事情表现出理智的态度，那末，会议的成功无疑地将是有保证的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们认为，目前已是各国政府领导人担当起艰巨的工作的时候了。希望外交部长们再作一番努力，谋求彼此都能接受的解决办法，并且就他们能够达成协议的问题达成协议。而剩下来的最困难的原则性问题，让政府首脑来研究。赫鲁晓夫着重说，我们希望能够就许多争执的问题达成协议，能够保证和平。
    赫鲁晓夫表示相信，艾森豪威尔总统将力求同苏联取得互相谅解，并且将尽力防止新战争爆发。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说，苏共中央和苏联政府认为，现在形成了这样一种局势，即帝国主义者未必敢对我们国家和对各个社会主义国家发动战争。我们的力量和社会主义盟国的力量是强大的，看来，西方现在也明白这一点。
