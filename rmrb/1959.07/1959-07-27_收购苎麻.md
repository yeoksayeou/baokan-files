    Purchasing Ramie
    The new ramie of this year is already on the market. Grasping the opportunity and striving to do a good job in purchasing ramie is an important task for the commercial departments at present. The growth of ramie this year is generally good. In Yangxin County, Hubei Province, the main producing area, the 80,000 mu of ramie have large bolls and dense plants. Currently, the broad masses of commune members are seizing the time to harvest the first crop of ramie under the call of "quick stripping, quick beating, quick hoeing, and quick topdressing," and are stepping up the cultivation of the second crop.
    Ramie is an important industrial raw material for the country. Ramie is also one of the country's export commodities. Fisheries and industries that manufacture transmission belts, automobile tires, cables, wires, aircraft wing fabrics, gunpowder, and high-grade textiles cannot do without ramie. Ramie not only has a wide range of uses, but its utility value is also very high. It can be used to manufacture high-grade paper and rayon.
    In order to do a good job in purchasing ramie, in addition to seizing the time to actively assist the communes and production teams in arranging labor for harvesting ramie and organizing specialized teams to rush to harvest the first crop, commercial departments should also strengthen propaganda and education work among the broad masses of commune members, so that the broad masses of people can clearly understand the importance of the state's purchase of ramie, and mobilize them to sell as much ramie as possible to the state. For ramie fibers, we must also mobilize communes and production teams to actively produce, ensuring that no scraps of ramie are discarded, in order to increase commune income and support national industrial construction.
    In terms of purchasing methods, commercial departments should, according to the characteristics of relatively dispersed ramie production, appropriately increase the number of purchasing points, or organize mobile purchasing, to facilitate the delivery and sale of ramie by communes and production teams. In concentrated ramie producing areas, commercial departments should also organize forces to carry out rush purchases to meet the communes' demands for selling ramie. However, no matter what kind of purchasing method is adopted, it is necessary to ensure accurate grading, accurate quantity, and complete procedures. Only when the purchasing work meets these requirements can the purchasing policy of "collecting more, collecting quickly, collecting well, and collecting sufficiently" be fully reflected.
    Promoting advanced stripping tools and improving ramie beating efficiency is an important aspect of doing a good job in ramie purchasing, and it must be given sufficient attention. Last year, various regions created many ramie stripping tools. Hubei Province alone successfully trial-produced more than 50 kinds of ramie scraping machines, which generally improved efficiency by more than double compared to manual ramie beating. However, the work of universal promotion was not done well enough, so the production in most ramie producing areas still remains at the level of manual stripping. This situation should be changed quickly. The promotion of stripping tools certainly requires certain technology and manpower. But this problem is not very difficult to solve. The key lies in strengthening organizational leadership. In order to ensure the timely completion of the ramie beating task, the Yangxin County Commercial Bureau of Hubei Province manufactured 60 standard samples and distributed them to various communes for imitation before holding an on-site meeting on the reform of ramie beating tools. The Commercial Bureau also organized two work groups to go deep into key areas to provide technical guidance. By May, more than 9,800 ramie scraping machines had been manufactured. This laid the foundation for improving stripping efficiency and accelerating the progress of ramie purchasing. We hope that the relevant leading departments in various ramie producing areas will pay attention to the work of promoting stripping tools, so as to create favorable conditions for accelerating this year's ramie purchasing work.

### 收购苎麻

    收购苎麻
    今年的新苎麻已经上市，抓紧时机努力做好苎麻收购工作是商业部门当前的一项重要任务。今年的苎麻生长情况普遍良好，主要产区湖北省的阳新县八万亩苎麻兜大、株密，目前广大社员正在“快剥、快打、快锄、快追肥”的号召下抢收头麻，并加紧培育二麻。
    苎麻是国家重要的工业原料。苎麻也是国家出口物资之一。渔业以及工业上制造传动带、汽车轮胎、电缆、电线、飞机翼布、火药、高级纺织品等都缺少不了苎麻。苎麻不仅用途广，它的使用价值也很大，它可以用来制造高级纸和人造丝等。
    为了做好苎麻的收购工作，商业部门除了应该抓紧时机积极协助公社生产队安排好收获苎麻的劳动力，组织专业队抢收头麻外，还应该向广大社员加强宣传教育工作，让广大社员群众清楚地了解国家收购苎麻的重要意义，动员他们尽量地把苎麻卖给国家。对于苎麻绒，也要动员公社和生产队积极生产，做到片麻不弃，以增加公社收入和支援国家工业建设。
    在收购方法上，商业部门应当根据苎麻生产比较分散的特点，适当地增加一些收购点，或者组织流动收购，以便利公社生产队交售。在苎麻集中产区，商业部门还要组织力量突击收购，以满足公社出售苎麻的要求。但是不论采取那种收购方法，都要做到验级准确，数量确实，手续完备。收购工作只有符合这些要求，才能完满地体现“多收、快收、收好、收足”的收购方针。
    推广先进的剥制工具，提高打麻效率，这是做好苎麻收购工作的一个重要方面，必须引起足够的重视。去年各地创造了不少的苎麻剥制工具，仅湖北省即试制成功五十多种刮麻机，一般都比手工打麻提高效率一倍以上。但是普遍推广工作做得很不够，因而大部分麻产区的生产仍然停留在手工剥制的水平上。这种情况是应该迅速改变的。推广剥制工具当然需要一定的技术和人力。但是这个问题并不是很难解决的，关键在于加强组织领导工作。湖北阳新县商业局为了保证打麻任务的及时完成，在召开打麻工具改革现场会议以前就制造出六十部标准样品，发给各公社仿制，商业局并组织了两个工作组深入到重点地区进行技术指导。到5月份就已经制成九千八百多部刮麻机。这样就为提高剥制效率、加快苎麻收购进度打下了基础。我们希望各苎麻产区的有关领导部门当前都要把推广剥制工具的工作重视起来，从而为加快今年的苎麻收购工作创造有利条件。
