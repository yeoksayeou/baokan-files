    The "Other Half" of Hongguang Cooperative
    Xing Huan
    If someone asked me: What is your most striking impression of the Hongguang People's Commune in Pixian County, Sichuan? I would answer without hesitation: It's the women. The First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee is a woman; the first person to greet us upon arriving at the Hongguang Management Area, our focus of investigation, was also a woman – the Deputy Director of the Commune stationed in the Hongguang Management Area; and when people talk about the development history of the Hongguang Management Area, they say that the first to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation in this township were three women – Xiao Shaoqun, the current Deputy Director of the Management Area, Zhang Anlin, the female captain of the First Production Team, and another female member, Wu Shaoqun. At first, we thought this was just a coincidence. But after hearing and seeing more, we realized that this truly reflects the increasingly significant role that women play in national life and production and construction after communization. The phrase "women hold up half the sky" has become a true depiction here.
    Whenever people recall the time after the commune was established last year, during the great battle of the "Four Autumns" and the great steelmaking campaign, they can't help but admire and say: If it weren't for the women, the autumn harvest, autumn planting, autumn plowing, and autumn storage tasks would not have been completed, let alone carrying out autumn plowing and planting according to the requirements of the "Eight-Point Charter" of Agriculture.

    The Role of Women in Production
    When the commune was established last year, due to the development of various tasks, only 17,000 laborers remained on the agricultural front, mainly women. They had to complete agricultural production tasks, engage in forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishing, and the labor demand in these areas greatly exceeded that of previous years. Although many women had not participated in major labor in the past and were not familiar with agricultural production techniques, they did not complain about the difficulties. They bravely worked with the male semi-laborers and successfully completed the tasks of the "Four Autumns," and autumn plowing and planting were done better and more meticulously than any previous year, ensuring the thorough implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter" of Agriculture. Over 80% of the more than 50,000 mu of summer harvest crops in the entire commune were deeply plowed to a depth of one foot or more. More than 90% of the wheat was planted using the "wide furrow strip dense planting" method. The women completed almost all of the work from deep plowing to sowing for the Hongguang Management Area's more than 3,000 mu of summer harvest crops such as wheat and rapeseed. In the past, many women had never done heavy and technical work such as carrying manure and plowing the land, but last year they learned to do it. Last year, the average male laborer in the entire commune worked 340 days, an increase of 36% compared to 250 days in 1956; female full laborers worked 310 days, an increase of 158% compared to 120 days in 1956. Last year, female labor accounted for 49.3% of the commune's total labor force. The proportion was even greater in the Hongguang Management Area. Before communization, the Ninth Production Team of this management area had a total of 172 laborers, of which 97 were male, accounting for 56.4% of the total; 75 were female, accounting for 43.6% of the total. After communization, there were a total of 203 laborers, of which 99 were male, an increase of 2 compared to before communization; 104 were female, an increase of 29 compared to before communization.

    Now, the role of women in production in the Hongguang Management Area is becoming increasingly important. The fact is indeed so. This year, the women pulled all of Hongguang Management Area's more than 1,000 mu of rapeseed in just two days; the women also harvested most of the more than 1,500 mu of wheat. The drying grounds and threshing floors are also entirely managed by women. As for the work of weeding and removing barnyard grass in the rice paddies, it is even more so the responsibility of women. According to incomplete statistics from the First Production Team, in May, Zhang Anlin, Lai Yuying, Lin Shufen, Wen Yufang, Li Xiuqing, Wu Yuhua and others earned more than 500 work points, which is equivalent to what a strong male laborer does; the average female laborer earned about 400 points, and the least earned more than 300 points, which is comparable to the average male commune member.

    In order to master agricultural production techniques and be able to better contribute to the commune's production, women in the Hongguang Management Area actively learned techniques from experienced farmers and technicians starting last autumn. In 1957, only 85 women in the entire management area knew how to transplant rice seedlings, but in 1958 there were 338; in 1957, only 23 women knew how to thresh grain, but in 1958 the number increased to 335; in 1957, no women plowed the fields at all, but by 1958, 14 women knew how to plow. The women of the First Production Team also organized a "March 8th Science Advancement Group" to study agricultural science and technology. From the time of planting wheat last year until the wheat matured this year, the technician gave them eleven lessons according to each stage of wheat growth, so that these women basically mastered the scientific and technical knowledge related to wheat growth.

        The Commune Liberated Women's Labor
    Why have women been able to play such a large role in agricultural production after communization? If you ask any woman, she will answer: The commune has created the conditions for us. In the past, many women in this commune also participated in production, especially more women in the Hongguang Management Area. However, at that time, in addition to going to work, women also had to shoulder heavy housework. Every day they had to cook, feed the pigs, wash clothes, make shoes and do needlework, and also take care of the children. It was a little better for families with fewer people, but for those with many people, women couldn't even manage just the housework all day long. Even if they participated in labor, their bodies were in the fields, but their minds were at home. These situations no longer exist after communization. For meals, there are public canteens; children can go to kindergartens and nurseries; for making clothes, there are sewing groups... These collective welfare undertakings have greatly liberated women's labor and stimulated women's enthusiasm for production. According to a survey by the Fourth Production Team of the Shengli Management Area of the Hongguang Commune: there are a total of 130 households in this team. In the past, each household needed someone to cook at home, and about 45 women could not go to work because they were too burdened by housework. Now these women have been liberated to participate in production.

    Because communization has completely liberated women, they participate in production with a feeling of gratitude and are very active in production. In the high work efficiency campaign launched during this year's summer harvest and summer planting, 24 women in the First Production Team of the Hongguang Management Area received awards for harvesting wheat and rapeseed quickly and well. More than 80% of the more than 20 women who participated in rice transplanting received awards.

    The women's shock brigade also launched a competition with the Lan Yuanzhi men's team. As a result of the competition, the two teams drew. On average, each person in the two teams transplanted more than one mu of rice seedlings, exceeding the quota.

    During the tense summer harvest and summer planting season, the weather in the Pixian area was often not good, with more rainy days. In order to seize the season, the women did not rest even when it rained. The Lin Shufen women's team of the First Production Team, a total of eight people, threshed more than 3,000 jin of rapeseed in the rain one day, greatly exceeding the quota.

    Women Fighting on Different Fronts
    Women are not only working so actively on the agricultural production front, but also performing well in other work positions. Whether in canteens or in kindergartens and nurseries, whether in pig farms or in tractor farming teams, one can see women's intense labor everywhere and hear moving stories of women's selfless labor. In the Hongguang Commune, in addition to a dedicated women's mechanized farming team, there are eleven female tractor drivers in the Hongguang Management Area's mechanized farming team alone. Female tractor driver Wu Fahui and the deputy captain, jointly driving the "Young Pioneer" locomotive, are striving to become a red flag vehicle this year. Xiong Shuqing of the Hongguang Management Area's pig farm is a mother of five and has been elected as a model feeder for three consecutive years. She has been raising pigs in the cooperative since the establishment of the advanced cooperative in 1956. She cares very much about the pigs, always cutting the pig feed finely and keeping the pigsty clean. When we visited this pig farm, we saw dry and tidy pigsties and heard only the grunts of pigs seeing strangers. Every day when she feeds the pigs, she carefully checks how the pigs are eating, whether they are full, and whether there are any problems. Therefore, since she started raising pigs, except for a few pigs purchased from other places last year that died of illness, none of the pigs bred and raised in the cooperative have died of illness. General feeders feed a dozen or twenty pigs, but in the second half of last year, she and Huang Fuyuan fed seventy or eighty pigs. Although they were extremely busy, the pigs were still raised very well.

    Dai Shuyu, the head of the cooking group at the central canteen of the Hongguang Management Area, always tries to improve the meals. She often says: If everyone eats well, production will be better. Therefore, she always keeps the food clean and delivers it to the members' tables by household. There is a lot of transient population in this canteen, one person comes for a short time, then another. Sometimes she has to cook five meals a day, and she has no time at all, but she never complains. In order to take care of the other cooks' sleep, she always gets up early and goes to bed late, taking on the most burdensome work herself.

    When talking about nannies, people say that Grandma Dai and Wu Erniang of the Hongguang Management Area's First Production Team nursery are both very good. Grandma Dai has been taking care of mothers' children since the mutual aid group period, and it has been several years now. She takes care of the children carefully, is not afraid of trouble, and takes care of the children very well. Whenever mothers go to work, they send their children, and when they need to work at night, the nannies also help take care of the children. Grandma Dai is now mainly in charge of the children's meals. In order to make the children healthy and grow well, she always makes the rice soft and the vegetables finely chopped, and also tries to make the food taste better when possible. Wu Erniang is like Grandma Dai, taking care of the children very carefully and patiently, and she is also very clean. No matter which child wets their diaper, she rushes to wash it as soon as she sees it, even if it is not the child she is responsible for. She quickly cleans up the house inside and out when it gets dirty. They also taught themselves to make some simple toys and walker chairs for the children. They said: If we take good care of the children, the mothers will be at ease and will be more energetic when they work.

    It is precisely because they closely connect production with life that those who do logistical work are so dedicated and considerate of the producers in every way. I believe that with the united efforts of women on the front and rear lines, and with so many people working actively in various positions, this year, the production of the Hongguang Commune will be done better and even better!

    红光社的“半边天”
    星环
    如果有人问我：在四川郫县红光公社你最突出的印象是什么？我将毫不迟疑地回答：是妇女。公社的党委第一书记是妇女；到达我们重点调查的红光管理区后，第一个接待我们的又是妇女——长驻红光管理区的公社副社长；和人们谈起红光管理区的发展史，人们说，这个乡第一个走互助合作道路的是三个妇女——现在的管理区副主任萧绍群，第一生产队女队长张安林，还有一个女社员巫绍群。开始，我们还以为这仅仅是一种巧合。但是当我们听得更多看得更多以后，才知道这正是真真切切地反映了公社化后的妇女，在国家生活和生产建设中发挥的作用愈来愈巨大了。“妇女半边天”，在这里已经成了真实的写照。
    每当人们回忆起去年公社成立后，大战“四秋”、大炼钢铁的时候，人们不由得不赞叹地说：要是没有妇女，去年的秋收秋种秋耕秋藏任务就完不成，更不用说按照“八字宪法”的要求来秋耕秋种了。
    妇女在生产上的作用
    去年公社成立的时候，由于各项工作都在发展，当时留在农业战线的只有一万七千个劳动力，其中主要是妇女。他们既要完成农业生产任务，又要搞林牧副渔等其他各业，而且这几方面的用工量都大大超过往年。尽管很多妇女过去并没有参加主要劳动，农业生产技术又不熟悉，但是，她们没有叫困难，她们勇敢地和男半劳力一起，出色地完成了“四秋”工作的任务，秋耕秋种比那一年都做得好、做得细，保证了“八字宪法”的彻底贯彻。全公社五万多亩夏收作物的田地，80％都深耕了一尺上下。90％以上的小麦实行了“宽厢条播密植”。红光管理区三千多亩小麦、油菜等夏收作物，从深耕到播种几乎全是妇女完成的。往年很多妇女没作过担粪、耕地等重活和技术活，去年都学着做了。去年整个公社平均每个男劳动力出工三百四十天，比1956年的二百五十天增加36％；女全劳动力出工三百一十天，比1956年的一百二十天增加158％。去年妇女劳力占公社总劳力的49.3％。红光管理区的比重更大，这个管理区的第九生产队在公社化前共有劳力一百七十二人，其中男劳动力九十七人，占总数的56.4％；女劳动力七十五人，占劳力总数的43.6％。公社化后共有劳力二百零三人，其中男劳动力九十九人，比公社化前增加二人；女劳动力一百零四人，比公社化前增加了二十九人。
    现在红光管理区的妇女在生产中的作用愈来愈重要了。事实确是如此，今年红光管理区一千多亩菜子，全部是妇女扯的，两天就扯完了；一千五百多亩麦子，大部分也是妇女收割的。晒场、打场也全部是妇女。至于秧田里的薅秧、除稗等工作，那更是由妇女担任了。据第一生产队的不完全统计，5月份妇女做到五百个工分以上的就有张安林、赖玉英、林淑芬、温玉芳、李秀清、吴玉华等人，等于一般男强劳力所做的工分；一般的妇女劳力做了四百分左右，最少的也做了三百多分，同一般的男社员不相上下。
    为了掌握农业生产技术，使自己能够更好地为公社的生产尽力，从去年秋天开始，红光管理区的妇女积极向老农、技术员学技术。1957年全管理区只有八十五个妇女会栽秧，1958年就有三百三十八个人了；1957年只有二十三个妇女会打谷子，1958年增加到三百三十五人；1957年根本没有妇女犁田，到1958年已有十四个妇女会犁田了。第一生产队的妇女还组织了“三八科学进军组”，学习农业科学技术。从去年种小麦起直到今年小麦成熟为止，按照小麦生长的每个环节，技术员给她们上了十一次课，使这些妇女基本上掌握了有关小麦生长的科学技术知识。
        公社解放了妇女劳力
    为什么公社化后妇女能够在农业生产上发挥这样大的作用？你问任何一个妇女，她都会回答：是公社给我们创造了条件。过去这个公社的妇女有不少人也参加生产，特别是红光管理区参加生产的妇女更多一些。但是，当时妇女除了出工以外，还要担任繁重的家务劳动，每天要煮饭、喂猪、洗衣、做鞋脚针线，还要带娃娃。家里人口少的还好一点，人口多的，妇女一天光忙家里就忙不赢，就是参加劳动，也是身在田头心在屋头。这些情况公社化后都不存在了。吃饭，有公共食堂；孩子可以进幼儿园、托儿所；做衣服，有缝纫组……。这些集体生活福利事业大大解放了妇女劳动力，激发了妇女生产的积极性。据红光公社胜利管理区第四生产队的调查：这个队一共一百三十户人家，过去每户需要一个人在家做饭，大约有四十五个妇女因家务牵累太重而不能出工，现在这些妇女都被解放出来参加了生产。
    由于公社化使妇女得到了彻底解放，因此，妇女们都怀着感激的心情参加生产，在生产上表现得非常积极。在今年夏收夏种开展的高工效运动中，红光管理区第一生产队有二十四个妇女因收割小麦、油菜又快又好得了奖。参加栽秧的二十多个妇女，有80％得了奖。
    妇女突击组还和兰远志男子组展开了竞赛，竞赛的结果，两家打成个平手。两个组平均每人栽秧一亩以上，都超过了定额。
    在夏收夏种正紧张的时候，郫县地区的气候经常不大好，阴雨天较多，为了抢季节，遇到下雨，妇女们也不休息。第一生产队林淑芬妇女组，一共八个人，有天冒雨打了菜子三千多斤，大大超过了定额。
    战斗在不同岗位上的妇女
    妇女不光在农业生产战线上劳动得这样积极，就是在其他工作岗位上也表现得很好。不管是在食堂还是在幼儿园、托儿所，不管是在养猪场还是在拖拉机耕作队，到处都可以看到妇女紧张的劳动，听到妇女忘我劳动的动人事迹。在红光公社，除了专门有一个女子机耕队外，仅仅在红光管理区机耕队，就有十一个女拖拉机手。女拖拉机手吴发惠和副队长共同驾驶的“少先号”机车，今年要争取成为红旗车呢。红光管理区养猪场的熊淑清，是五个孩子的妈妈，也是连续三年当选的模范饲养员。从1956年办高级社起，她就在社里养猪。她对猪非常关心，猪食总是切得细细的，猪圈经常打扫得干干净净的。当我们去参观这个猪场的时候，看见的是干燥整洁的猪圈，听见的只是猪见了生人的哼哼声。她每天喂猪时，都要仔细看看猪吃得怎么样，吃饱了没有，有没有毛病。因此她喂猪以来，除了去年从外地购进的一些猪病死几头以外，在本社自繁自养的没有生病死去的。一般饲养员都是喂十几二十头猪，但去年下半年，她和黄福元两人就喂了七八十头猪。虽然忙得不可开交，但猪还是养得很好。
    红光管理区中心食堂的炊事组长戴淑玉，总是想方设法把伙食办好，她常说：大家吃的好，生产才搞得好。因此，她总是把饭菜弄得干干净净，而且按户给社员送到桌上。这个食堂的流动人口很多，一会这个来了，一会那个又来，有时一天她要做五顿饭，一点空也没有，但她总不抱怨。为了照顾别的炊事员的睡眠，她总是起早睡晚，自己担任最繁重的工作。
    谈到保育员，人们都说红光管理区第一生产队托儿所的戴婆婆和伍二娘都很好。戴婆婆从互助组时期就给妈妈们带娃娃，到现在已经好几年了。她带娃娃细心、不怕麻烦，把娃娃带得很好。妈妈们啥时出工啥时把孩子送来，晚上要夜战，她们也帮着管孩子。戴婆婆现在主要管娃娃们的伙食，为了让娃娃身体健康，长得好，她总是把饭弄得软软的，菜切得细细的，还在可能条件下把菜做得口味好一点。伍二娘也像戴婆婆一样，带娃娃很尽心、耐烦，又爱清洁，不管那个娃娃尿湿了片子，她看见了都赶着去洗，即使不是她负责管的娃娃也是这样。屋里屋外弄脏了，她就赶快打扫干净。她们还自己学着给娃娃做了点简单的玩具和学步的圈椅。她们说：把娃娃带好，妈妈们就放心，劳动起来也展劲。
    正是由于她们把生产同生活紧密地连接在一起，所以她们这些做后勤工作的才这样尽心尽意，才这样处处为生产者着想。我相信，有了前后方妇女的团结一致，有了这么许多在各个岗位上积极劳动的人，今年，红光公社的生产将要搞得更好，更好！
