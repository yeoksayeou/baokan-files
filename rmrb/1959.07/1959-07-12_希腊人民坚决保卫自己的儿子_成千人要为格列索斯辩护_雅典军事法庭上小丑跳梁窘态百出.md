Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch from Athens: According to a TASS report from Athens: The Athens Military Court continued to try Manolis Glezos and other Greek patriots yesterday.

The defendant's lawyer requested that police officer Papaspyropoulos not be allowed to testify as a plaintiff witness. This officer participated in the investigation of the false accusation case against Glezos and others. However, the court unreasonably rejected this request yesterday morning.

The presiding judge announced that he opposed the movement to defend Glezos. He described the movement as "interfering in Greece's judicial affairs."

Defense lawyers protested the presiding judge's slander against Glezos.

Glezos also protested the presiding judge's actions. He said that during the trial, he would express his opinions on the procedures for trying him.

The presiding judge rudely interrupted the lawyers and Glezos.

Subsequently, the court questioned four "plaintiff witnesses," three of whom were police officers. "Witness" Papaspyropoulos could not produce any evidence in court but talked at length about his "theory of world communist espionage." When this "plaintiff witness" made his testimony vague, the presiding judge quickly helped him explain.

During the evening trial, the presiding judge said that Papaspyropoulos was the main plaintiff witness.

Then, Papaspyropoulos basically repeated the content of the indictment.

The scale of the movement to defend Glezos is expanding daily. More and more people are sending telegrams from abroad to the presiding judge of the military court, stating that arbitrary actions against Glezos and other democrats will not be allowed.

The Greek public attaches great importance to the letter from K.Y. Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, to King Paul I of Greece regarding the trial of Glezos.

According to the "Dawn Daily" report, the number of witnesses defending Glezos has increased to nine hundred and four. In order to limit the number of public representatives in the court, the Greek authorities reduced the already small number of seats in the court reserved for foreign public representatives and journalists by one-third.

    希腊人民坚决保卫自己的儿子
    成千人要为格列索斯辩护
    雅典军事法庭上小丑跳梁窘态百出
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社雅典讯：雅典军事法庭昨天继续审讯曼诺里斯·格列索斯和其他希腊爱国者。
    被告辩护人要求不许警官帕帕斯皮罗普洛斯作原告证人，这个警官参加过对格列索斯等人的诬告案件的侦察工作。但是法庭在昨天上午无理地拒绝了这个要求。
    法庭庭长宣布，他反对保卫格列索斯的运动。他把这个运动说成是“干涉希腊的司法事务”。
    辩护律师们抗议法庭庭长对格列索斯的诬蔑。
    格列索斯也抗议庭长的行动。他说，在审讯过程中，他将对审讯他的程序表示自己的意见。
    法庭庭长粗暴地打断了律师们和格列索斯的发言。
    随后法庭讯问四个“原告证人”，其中有三个是警察。“证人”帕帕斯皮罗普洛斯在法庭上拿不出什么证据来，却大谈其“世界共产主义间谍活动的理论”。当这个“原告证人”把证词说得含混不清的时候，庭长就连忙帮他解释。
    在晚上的审讯中，法庭庭长说，帕帕斯皮罗普洛斯是主要的原告证人。
    于是，帕帕斯皮罗普洛斯就把起诉书的内容基本上重复了一遍。
    保卫格列索斯运动的规模在日益扩大。越来越多的人从外国打电报给军事法庭庭长，表示不允许对格列索斯和其他民主人士采取专横的行动。
    希腊公众非常重视苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫就审讯格列索斯一事给希腊国王保罗一世的信件。
    据“黎明日报”报道，为格列索斯辩护的证人已经增加到九百零四人。希腊当局为了限制公众在法庭上的代表人数，把法庭内留给外国公众代表以及记者的本来就不多的座位，又减少了三分之一。（附图片）
