To leverage collective wisdom and improve teacher quality, middle school teachers in Wuhu City, Anhui Province, have united to establish inter-school teaching and research groups. By engaging in teaching research activities, they have improved teaching methods and raised the level of teachers.

Wuhu City began establishing inter-school teaching and research organizations in middle schools as early as 1950. In recent years, there has been significant development. Currently, all of the city's more than 570 teachers participate in subject-specific inter-school teaching and research groups according to the courses they teach. To further strengthen the Party's leadership over the teaching and research groups, eight Party member principals have been appointed as heads of the teaching and research groups this semester. The inter-school teaching and research groups conduct regular teaching research work based on the needs of teaching, closely coordinating with the teaching and research groups in each school. Participants in inter-school teaching and research group activities are generally the heads of the teaching and research groups from each school, with meetings of all teachers convened when necessary.

The main tasks of the inter-school teaching and research groups are to conduct collective lesson preparation, exchange and learn advanced experiences, and compile teaching reference materials based on teaching needs, and in close coordination with the teaching and research groups in each school. When the newly compiled textbooks for geography and biology were not yet available this semester, the inter-school teaching and research groups prepared lecture outlines through collective lesson preparation, clarifying teaching priorities and ensuring teaching quality. The inter-school teaching and research groups also conduct special studies focusing on key issues in teaching. For example, science, chemistry, and biology departments have studied how to strengthen experiments and internships in coordination with teaching; the language department has studied issues urgently needing resolution in teaching, such as the teaching of political essays, how to use artistic images to inspire students, and how to improve students' writing skills.

Through inter-school teaching and research activities, teachers have fully leveraged their expertise and collective strength, solving problems in teaching. Special lectures are organized to meet the needs of teachers in teaching, inviting professors from Anhui Normal University or experienced veteran teachers, as well as veteran workers and technicians, to lecture on various knowledge related to teaching; sometimes teachers are organized to visit and learn, in order to help teachers improve their theoretical and practical knowledge, enrich teaching content, and promote the connection between teaching theory and practice in various subjects. The inter-school teaching and research groups also promptly exchange advanced teaching experiences and improve teaching methods in a timely manner. For example, before 1956, science and chemistry teaching in various schools generally neglected experiments. After the inter-school teaching and research groups carried out experience exchange in this area, this shortcoming was quickly corrected. Wuhu No. 8 Middle School, No. 10 Middle School, and other schools have strengthened students' writing guidance by guiding students to prepare outlines before writing essays, and this method has been very effective. Through the activities of the inter-school teaching and research groups, this method was immediately adopted by various schools. In the trial teaching activity of the article "The Bourgeois Direction of Wenhui Daily Should Be Criticized," the language teaching and research group found that teachers neglected students' ability to accept explanations, and proposed that attention should be paid to students' ability to accept explanations when explaining political essays, emphasizing the need to explain the structure section by section so that students understand the meaning of the text.

### 发挥集体智慧　提高教师水平  芜湖各中学组织校际教研组

    发挥集体智慧　提高教师水平
    芜湖各中学组织校际教研组
    本报讯　安徽芜湖市各中学教师联合起来成立校际教研组，发挥教师集体智慧，开展教学研究活动，从而改进了教学，提高了教师水平。
    芜湖市早在1950年就开始建立中学校际教研组织。几年来，又有很大发展，现在，全市五百七十多名教师，都按照所教课程分别参加了学科校际教研组。为了进一步加强党对教研组的领导，本学期已指定八位党员校长兼任教研组长。校际教研组根据教学上的需要，定期进行教学研究工作。经常参加校际教研组活动的，一般是各校教研组长，必要时召开全体教师会议。
    校际教研组的主要任务是根据教学的需要，并与各校教研组密切配合进行集体备课，交流和学习先进经验，编写教学参考资料。本学期地理、生物新编教材未到时，通过校际教研组集体备课，编写了讲授提纲，明确了教学重点，保证了教学质量。校际教研组还围绕着教学上存在的关键问题，开展专题研究。如理、化、生物等科曾研究了如何配合教学，加强实验和实习问题；语文科研究了有关政论文教学、如何以艺术形象感染学生、如何提高学生写作水平等教学中迫切需要解决的问题。
    教师们通过校际教研活动，充分发挥了教师的特长和集体力量，解决了教学上存在的问题。针对教师教学上的需要，组织专题讲座，邀请安徽师范学院教授或水平高的老教师以及请老工人、技术员讲授各种与教学有关的知识；有时还组织教师参观访问，以帮助教师提高理论和实际知识，丰富教学内容，促进各科教学理论和实际的联系。校际教研组还及时交流教学上的先进经验，及时改进教学。如1956年以前，各校理化教学普遍忽视实验，校际教研组开展这方面的经验交流以后，这一缺点迅速得到了纠正。芜湖八中、十中等校为了加强学生的写作指导，他们指导学生在作文前先拟订提纲，采用这种办法效果很好。通过校际教研组的活动，这一办法立即为各校所采用。语文教研组在“文汇报资产阶级方向应当批判”一文试教活动中，发现教师讲解忽视学生接受能力，就提出讲解政论文应注意学生接受能力，强调要逐段讲清结构，使学生理解课文的意义。
