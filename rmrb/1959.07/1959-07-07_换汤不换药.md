    New Bottle, Old Wine
    By Zhukov (Soviet Union)
    The traditional policies of the colonialists in the Middle East are mainly threefold: first, relying on the support of traitorous feudal upper classes; second, acting according to the "divide and conquer" formula commonly used by all enslavers; and third, directly interfering in internal affairs through subversive activities or armed intervention. These three points, lightly disguised under the guise of "aid," are also manifested in the notorious "Eisenhower Doctrine" because American colonialists associate this doctrine with a far-sighted plan to curb the rising tide of the national liberation movement in Arab countries.
    The events that took place in the Near East last year have convincingly demonstrated the bankruptcy of this attempt. The revolution in Iraq overnight overthrew the Nuri al-Said puppet regime—an important pillar of imperialism in the region. The attempt to stage a comeback through open armed aggression against Lebanon and Jordan not only failed to achieve the expected results but ultimately caused the interventionists to reap the bitter fruit of their actions.
    The British "Manchester Guardian" bluntly admitted: "The Eisenhower Doctrine has suffered such an obvious failure that paying attention to it is simply like flogging a dead horse." The entire system of colonial exploitation and plunder, which the colonialists had painstakingly managed for generations, is more precarious than it was during the Suez adventure.
        Resurrection of a Corpse
    The real prospect of being eventually driven out of the Near East forces the colonialists to hurriedly seek new ways to salvage their crumbling position. After traveling to various countries in the Near East, the American commentator Alsop called on the West to quickly begin "clearing the ruins." He comforted the imperialists by saying that "there is still a possibility of starting all over again." Thus, American diplomats, in the figurative language of the "Manchester Guardian," began to hurriedly "flog the dead horse back to life."
    After "some urgent work," the old tricks of splitting the ranks of the Arab national liberation movement and undermining the friendship between Arab countries and the socialist camp countries were first dug out from the rubble of the "Eisenhower Doctrine."
    The colonialists place great hope in this regard on the activities of Eugene Black, the agent of the American oil monopoly group and the president of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. On the surface, the "Black Plan" seems to be a harmless "aid" plan for the implementation of certain development plans of the United Arab Republic. However, in fact, it has another purpose. A British Reuters reporter wrote bluntly: "The purpose of the 'Black Plan' is to 'undermine the economic ties between the UAR and the Eastern bloc countries.'" Not long after this, the "Chicago Sun-Times" hurriedly claimed that "the U.S. government solemnly supports the Black Plan." According to the newspaper, if professional spreaders of chaos can succeed in undermining the relations between Arab countries and socialist countries, then the "Black Plan" can enable them to "penetrate the formed gaps."
    The second step in the resurrection of the corpse is to re-create the threat of armed intervention in Arab countries. The first step of American diplomacy in this regard was to conclude bilateral military agreements with the participating countries of the aggressive Ankara Pact (the name after Iraq declared the abolition of the Baghdad Pact). The purpose of these treaties is also to create an excuse for Washington to re-intervene militarily in the internal affairs of the Arab East at the appropriate time.
    Thus, it seems that only two main points of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" have actually been revived.
    The third point of this "doctrine"—relying on the support of feudal traitorous groups within Arab countries—is somewhat different. Even within the British colonialists—for whom the alliance with the Nuri al-Said elements and the Faisal elements was a unique political "tradition" in the region—voices were raised calling for a change of policy.
    The London "International Affairs" magazine, representing the interests of influential British groups, published an article in the first issue of this year calling for a "reassessment of the West's relations with Arab countries." After studying the reasons for the decline of the West's political prestige in the Arab East, the author concluded that the policies of the United States and Britain have "weakened the social strata most inclined to the West." The British expert on Near East issues, Johnson, reached this most disheartening view in his book "World Roaming." He vainly demanded that the colonialists use part of the looted money to buy off the Arab national bourgeoisie.
    Similar arguments can also be heard across the Atlantic.
    The American "Wall Street Journal" reporter Gibson said: "Diplomats are now convinced that the practice of striving for a formal alliance between all Near East countries and the United States is not necessarily realistic… Therefore, the State Department consciously adopted a more gentle and solicitous approach to the Near East, hoping to gain friends more reliably through this method than through warm embraces."
    The rampant activities of various American representatives in the Arab East recently also prove this point. Black's three consecutive visits to Cairo, the recent visit of the American ambassador to the UAR to the Syrian region, and the Arab East tour of the "American Friends of the Middle East Society" delegation are just individual manifestations of a carefully planned activity, the purpose of which is to prove to the Arab public that there seems to be a "turning point" in American policy in favor of "friendship" with them.
    Speaking of this, one cannot help but recall the maxim of the well-known American imperialist ideologue and practitioner Theodore Roosevelt. As early as the beginning of the twentieth century, he advised: "Speak softly, but carry a big stick; you will go far!" This generation of American imperialists, from all aspects, does not seem to have forgotten the founder of the "big stick" policy's legacy.
    All the "gentle" activities are carried out under the banner of so-called economic "interdependence" between imperialist countries and the peoples of the Arab East. The originator of this "interdependence" theory is the American oil tycoon Rockefeller. The imperialist propaganda machine insists that Arab countries have abundant oil reserves and urgently need funds to develop industry; while Western countries with extensive investment conditions need oil from the Near East. In other words, American propagandists are saying that not only does the West need oil from the Near East, but Arab countries also need Western capital.
          Same as Before
    Hidden under the rhetoric of "interdependence" is the usual monstrous lie, with which the imperialists want to at least extend their tails to where their heads cannot penetrate. It takes no effort to expose this lie. More than half a century has passed since the oil monopoly group began to forcibly impose "interdependence" on the peoples of the Near East. During this period, countless billions of dollars have poured into the safes of London and New York monopolists. However, the situation of the local residents has not changed at all, and they still live in poverty and economic backwardness. It turns out that the only real purpose of "interdependence" is the hegemony of the oil trusts, which make a fortune by exploiting the people of Arab countries.
    The famous Polish poet Julian Tuwim once said: A philanthropist is someone who openly returns a small part of what he has secretly plundered. The notorious "interdependence" most convincingly confirms the truth of this maxim. The international oil cartel obtains more than two billion U.S. dollars in net profit each year from the extraction of "black gold" in the Near East. The "aid" given by American "philanthropists" to the peoples of the Arab East from the Persian Gulf to Casablanca in recent years is only one-tenth of this figure. The notorious "interdependence" is precisely for the purpose of permanently maintaining this relationship between slave owners and slaves. The Western propaganda machine and their echoers in the Arab East are clamoring endlessly about this "interdependence."
    Washington's entire political strategy is currently mainly based on vigorously promoting "aid." The "Black Plan" is far from being the only neo-colonialist bait that the American ruling group hopes to use to lure the peoples of the Arab East into the trap. The strategists of "psychological warfare," in order to prove that there has been a "shift" in American policy, even cited such things as the United States "unfreezing" the 25 million U.S. dollars of Egyptian assets that it illegally froze in 1956. Washington has repeatedly issued meaningful hints to Arab countries that military "aid" can be given.
    Such small favors and promises may arouse some hope among certain people in the Arab bourgeoisie. However, the fact remains that the United States will never want to give the peoples of Arab countries genuine assistance. In this regard, it is enough to recall the course of the American "plan" to allocate funds for the Aswan Dam. What was the result? After the attempt by American imperialists to intimidate Cairo failed, they simply refused to participate in the project, the implementation of which could greatly improve the situation of millions of Arabs. It is particularly noteworthy that the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development was also chosen as a tool for this intimidation.
    Therefore, the strategic goals of American imperialism in this part of the world have not changed in the slightest. The "new policy" of American colonialists is still that "Eisenhower Doctrine." It is merely a case of changing the soup without changing the medicine. A Cairo weekly "Rose al-Youssef," known for being pro-American, recently said sadly: "The policy that the United States is implementing towards us today is still the same as the policy that it implemented towards us yesterday. Its policy towards us will also be the same tomorrow…"

    换汤不换药
    苏联　茹可夫
    殖民主义者在中近东的传统政策主要有三点：第一，依靠卖国的封建上层分子的支持；第二，根据一切奴役者惯用的“分而治之”的公式行事；第三，以颠复活动或用武装干涉的方式直接干涉内政。用“援助”的幌子轻轻掩盖起来的上面这三点也表现在恶名昭彰的“艾森豪威尔主义”中，因为，美国殖民主义者正是把这种主义同遏止阿拉伯国家民族解放运动高涨的深谋远虑的计划联系在一起。
    去年近东发生的事件十分确凿地说明了这种企图的破产。伊拉克的革命一夜之间就推翻了努里·赛义德傀儡专制政权——帝国主义在这个地区的重要支柱。妄想用对黎巴嫩和约旦的公开的武装侵略手段卷土重来的企图不仅没有带来预期的结果，而且终于使干涉者自食恶果。
    英国“曼彻斯特卫报”直言不讳地承认：“艾森豪威尔主义遭到了如此明显的失败，以至对这个主义的关注简直就像鞭策一匹死马一样”。殖民主义者世世代代苦心经营的整个殖民剥削掠夺体系比苏伊士冒险时期更加岌岌可危了。
        死灰复燃
    终究要被逐出近东的这一实际前景迫使殖民主义者匆匆忙忙地寻找新方法来挽救他们摇摇欲坠的地位。美国评论员艾尔索普在旅行了近东各国以后，呼吁西方赶快着手“清除废墟”。他安慰帝国主义者说，“还存在着一切从头开始的可能性”。于是，美国外交家，用
  “曼彻斯特卫报”的形象的比喻来说，开始匆匆忙忙地“鞭策起死马来了”。
    经过“一番紧急工作”，首先从“艾森豪威尔主义”的废墟堆里找出了分裂阿拉伯民族解放运动队伍的老手腕，破坏阿拉伯各国和社会主义阵营各国之间友谊的手腕。
    殖民主义者把这方面的巨大希望寄托在美国石油垄断集团的代理人、担任国际复兴开发银行行长的布莱克的活动上。从表面上看，“布莱克计划”好像是对实现阿拉伯联合共和国的某些发展计划无害的“援助”计划。然而，事实上，它还有另一个目的。英国的路透社记者直截了当地写道：“布莱克计划”的目的是“破坏阿联同东方集团国家的经济联系”。在这不久以后，“芝加哥太阳时报”急忙声称“美国政府郑重支持布莱克计划”。按报纸的话说，如果职业的散布混乱的专家们能够在破坏阿拉伯国家同社会主义国家关系方面得逞，那么，“布莱克计划”就可以使他们“钻进已经形成的缺口”。
    死灰复燃的第二个步骤是重新制造对阿拉伯国家的武装干涉威胁。美国外交在这方面的第一个步骤是同侵略性的安卡拉条约（即伊拉克宣告废除巴格达条约以后的名称）的参加国缔结双边军事协定。这些条约的目的也是为了在适当的时机给华盛顿制造重新武装干涉阿拉伯东方内政的借口。
    这样看来，实际上只复活了“艾森豪威尔主义”的两个主要之点。
    这个“主义”的第三点——依靠阿拉伯国家内部的封建卖国集团的支持，这个问题就有些不同了。甚至在英国殖民主义者内部——对他们来说，同努里·赛义德分子以及费萨尔分子的联盟是这个地区的独特的政治“传统”——也发出了要求改变方针的呼声。
    代表英国有影响的集团利益的伦敦“国际事务”杂志在今年第一期上发表了一篇号召“重新估计西方同阿拉伯国家的关系”的文章。作者研究了西方在阿拉伯东方的政治威信下降的原因后，得出结论说，美国和英国的政策使“最倾向于西方的社会阶层削弱了”。英国近东问题专家约翰逊在他的“世界漫游”一书中就得出了这种最伤心的见解。他枉费心机地要求殖民主义者用部分掠夺来的钱收买阿拉伯民族资产阶级。
    这一类的议论也可以在大西洋的彼岸听到。
    美国“华尔街日报”记者吉布逊说：“外交家如今已确信，争取所有近东国家同美国结成正式联盟的做法不一定现实了。……因而国务院有意识地采取了较为和气和殷切对待近东的决定，指望通过这种办法比用热烈拥抱更为可靠地得到朋友。”
    最近以来，美国各色各样的代表在阿拉伯东方的猖獗活动也证明了这一点。布莱克一连三次访问了开罗，美国驻阿联大使最近访问了叙利亚地区，“美国中东之友社”代表团的阿拉伯东方之行，这一切只是精心策划的活动中的个别表现，这种活动的目的，就是要向阿拉伯公众证明，似乎在美国的政策中“出现了”有利于同他们的“友谊”的“转折点”。
    谈到这里，不禁令人想起美国帝国主义的赫赫有名的思想家和实行家西奥杜·罗斯福的箴言。早在二十世纪初叶他就奉劝过：“话要说得客气些，但要预备一条大棒，你才能走得远！”这一代的美帝国主义者从各方面看来没有忘记“大棒”政策的创始者的遗训。 
    “客气”对待的全部活动都是在帝国主义国家和阿拉伯东方各国人民之间的所谓经济“相互依赖”的旗帜下进行的。这种“相互依赖”的理论的首创者是美国石油大王洛克菲勒。帝国主义宣传机构硬说：阿拉伯国家蕴藏着丰富的石油，并且迫切需要资金来发展工业；而拥有投资的广泛条件的西方国家则需要近东的石油。换句话说，美国宣传家是说，不光是西方需要近东的石油，而且阿拉伯国家也需要西方的资本。
          今与昔同
    在“相互依赖”的词藻下掩藏着惯用的弥天大谎，帝国主义者就是想用这种谎言至少把尾巴伸向脑袋钻不进去的地方。要戳穿这种谎言是不费吹灰之力的。自从石油垄断集团开始用武力把“相互依赖”强加给近东各国人民的时候起到现在已经过去半个多世纪了。在这期间，不知有多少亿美元涌入了伦敦和纽约垄断资本家的保险柜。然而，当地居民的状况丝毫没有改变，他们仍然在贫困和经济落后的境况下过活。原来，“相互依赖”的唯一的真实目的是石油托辣斯的霸权，它们用剥削阿拉伯国家人民的方法大发横财。
    著名的波兰诗人尤利安·土威姆曾经说过：慈善家就是把一小部分偷偷掠夺来的东西公开还回去的人。声名狼借的“相互依赖”最确凿不过地证实了这句格言的真实性。国际石油卡特尔每年从开采近东的“黑色金子”当中得到的纯利在二十亿美元以上。而美国“慈善家”们给从波斯湾到卡萨布兰卡的阿拉伯东方各国人民的“援助”，近几年加起来也不过这个数字的十分之一而已。声名狼借的“相互依赖”正是为了把这种奴隶主与奴隶的关系永久保持下去。西方宣传机构和它们在阿拉伯东方的应声虫就是对这种“相互依赖”叫嚷不休。
    华盛顿的整个政治战略目前也主要是以大肆宣扬“援助”为基础。“布莱克计划”远不是美国统治集团指望用来引诱阿拉伯东方人民进入罗网的唯一的新殖民主义诱饵。“心理战”的战略家们为了证明美国政策有了“转变”，竟举出了这样的事情：美国“解冻了”它在1956年非法冻结的二千五百万美元的埃及资产。华盛顿向阿拉伯各国接二连三地发出可以给予军事“援助”的意味深长的暗示。
    诸如此类的小恩小惠和诺言也许会在阿拉伯资产阶级的某些人士中引起一些希望。可是，事实终究是事实：美国死也不希望给予阿拉伯各国人民以真诚援助。在这方面，只要回忆一下美国给阿斯旺水坝拨款“计划”的经过，就足够了。结果怎样呢？美国帝国主义者在恫吓开罗的企图遭到失败后，干脆拒绝了参加这项设计，而这项设计的实现可以大大改善千百万阿拉伯人的状况。特别值得注意的是，当时也是选择了国际复兴开发银行作为这种恫吓的工具的。
    所以说，美国帝国主义在世界这部分地区的战略目的丝毫没有改变。美国殖民主义者的“新方针”仍然是那个“艾森豪威尔主义”。只不过是换了汤而没有换药而已。以亲美著称的一家开罗周刊“鲁兹·优素福”最近也痛心地说：“今天美国对我们实行的政策仍然与昨天对我们实行的政策一样。它对我们的政策明天也将是如此……”
