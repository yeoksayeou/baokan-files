    Seeing the Dark Serf System of Tibet from an Estate
    By our reporter Yuan Dingqian
    The resolution passed by the Second Plenary Session of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region on carrying out democratic reforms throughout the region reflects the ardent desire of the broad masses of people in Tibet to completely abolish the dark and cruel serf system. Now, the call to support this resolution has resounded throughout the Tibetan Plateau.
    Here, the reporter introduces the situation seen in a serf owner's Xika (estate). Although this is just a small corner of the entire serf society of Tibet, from the tragic experiences of the serfs on this estate, we can understand why the serfs in Tibet today are urgently demanding reform, and at the same time, it can illustrate how urgently it is necessary to completely abolish the serf system.
  The Serf Owner Occupies Everything in the Xika
    This Xika belongs to the rebel, former Tibetan local government Kanqiong (fourth-rank monk official) Ouxie·Tudeng Sangque, and is located in Dongga Zong, west of Lhasa, more than thirty miles from Lhasa. There are a total of more than 130 serfs in the entire Xika, including 14 Chaba households, 7 Duichong households, and 14 Langsheng people. Except for three Duichong households belonging to other lords, the rest of these serfs are Ouxie's serfs.
    The serf owner Ouxie occupied everything in the Xika, including all 595 Ke 13 Sheng of land (here Ke refers to area, the land for one Ke of seeds is called one Ke of land, one Ke is about 25 Jin) and houses, and most of the livestock and farm tools. The only few stone mills in the entire Xika were also all occupied by Ouxie.
    Ouxie's management organization here is called "Xiongjiang" in Tibetan, meaning "government on the territory." This management organization owns a three-story building and a villa dedicated to Ouxie for summer retreats. Ouxie himself does not often come to the Xika, only staying for a month or two in the summer. He set up a "Xinie" (Xika manager) and a "Lieben" (in charge of serf labor) in this "government" to rule all the serfs and manage the income of the Xika on his behalf.
    Near the tall building of the Xika management organization, there are some low and dilapidated bungalows, which are the "Chafang" for the Chaba serfs to live in. Many serfs have lived in these dark houses for generations. A few Chaba families have a few small livestock and farm tools, but the vast majority of Duichong have no property. All they have are tattered clothes and incomplete food utensils. As for the Langsheng, they are even more miserable. Most of them sleep with livestock and own nothing.
    Like most serf owner estates in Tibet, the land in this Xika is mainly cultivated by the Chaba. However, none of the 14 Chaba households in the entire Xika had plowing cattle or plows, only some small livestock and simple farm tools such as hoes, rakes, and sickles. Every spring and autumn when plowing, they had to rent them from the Xika at high rents, paying 30 Liang of Tibetan silver (equivalent to 2 yuan in silver dollars) per day for each pair (two heads) of cattle, and also providing fodder for the plowing cattle. Generally, this expenditure alone costs a farmer about 10 Ke of Qingke per year. Most Chaba also have to rent the Xika's donkeys when doing livestock labor for the Xika or Ouxie's family, paying a rent of 7 Liang 5 Qian to 10 Liang per donkey per day.
      The Personal Dependence of Serfs
    In the serf owner Ouxie's account books, there are detailed records of the population of each serf household. When serfs have children, they must register with the serf owner; if serfs separate their families or marry serfs from other lords, they must also report to Ouxie and obtain his approval, otherwise they will be punished.
    Regardless of the type of serf, the serf owner does not allow them to leave the Xika to seek other livelihoods, except for private escapes. When the serf owner needs them, they must be available at any time and cannot delay or resist. Ouxie can also freely give serfs to other serf owners, or even sell them, or otherwise dispose of them. Among the Chaba and Langsheng here, some were transferred by Ouxie from another Xika in Shannan, and some Langsheng did not belong to Ouxie before, but were given or exchanged to Ouxie by other serf owners.
    This Xika has six male Langsheng and eight female Langsheng. Not only have they been slaves for generations, but they also do not have the right to marry and establish a family. For example, Langsheng Gama and Gui Sang sisters have been Ouxie's cattle and horses for 50 or 60 years, and they have never enjoyed the happiness of a family. Some Langsheng combined privately, and some combined after being approved by the "Xinie," but they could not establish a separate family after they combined. For example, Langsheng Sangdan (male) and Duichong Bazhu have been together for more than ten years and have four children, but they are still Langsheng and Duichong respectively. In the past, Sangdan often lived in the lord's house and could not live with Bazhu, let alone work for Bazhu. Chaba Zhongdui·Bianba (female) has been married to a Langsheng from the nearby Jiang'e Xika for several years, but they cannot often live together and can only occasionally visit each other and stay for one night. According to the regulations of the serf system, children born from the combination of this lord's serf and another lord's serf, boys follow the father and girls follow the mother, each being a serf belonging to their lord. These serfs of Ouxie must also strictly abide by this regulation.
    Like serfs in other parts of Tibet, the serfs here are tightly bound by the three chains of the serf owner, and personal dependence is only one of them. The two chains of corvée labor and usury make them work hard all year round without getting enough to eat and wear, and even lead to family ruin.
  Heavy Corvée Labor and High Rents
    Of the total 595 Ke 13 Sheng of land in this Xika, two-thirds are the serf owner's self-operated land, which is operated by serfs paying corvée labor. The 14 Chaba households pay 13 year-round corvée labors to the serf owner in exchange for cultivating 193 Ke 14 Sheng of allocated land, which only accounts for one-third of the total land. The Chaba who cultivates 19 Ke of allocated land must pay one and a half year-round corvée labors; those who cultivate 6 to 9 Ke of allocated land must pay half a year-round corvée labor.
    Serfs who pay year-round corvée labor must work on the serf owner's self-operated land free of charge all year round, and also bear all other miscellaneous tasks of the serf owner. They have even less freedom than ordinary serfs. When they work, the "Lieben" directs and supervises them. They have to do whatever they are told to do. If they slack off a little, they will be beaten and scolded. They work hard for the serf owner all year round, but they have to bring their own farm tools and food. The serf owner does not even provide tea.
    Every household that pays a year-round corvée labor must also send an additional person to work on the serf owner's self-operated land for about two months in spring and autumn, and also rent several donkeys to transport fertilizer, seeds, grain, fodder, etc. for the serf owner. The busiest time of the year for farming is also the time when there is the most corvée labor. At this time, the serfs must all be mobilized to work on the serf owner's self-operated land first, and then they can work on their own allocated land.
    According to the reporter's preliminary investigation, based on the average calculation of the main corvée labor paid by the serfs to the serf owner each year, serfs who cultivate 15 Ke 14 Sheng of allocated land bear 440 units of labor and 40 units of animal labor per year. Some Chaba bear even heavier internal corvée labor because they have less allocated land. For example, Suolang Zeren, who only cultivates 10 Ke 10 Sheng of allocated land, still has to pay a year-round corvée labor, and Kama Zhuoma, who only cultivates 5 Ke 14 Sheng of allocated land, also has to pay half a year-round corvée labor. In order to increase the free labor for operating self-operated land, the serf owner gradually reduced the amount of allocated land for serfs year by year, thereby increasingly increasing the corvée labor burden on serfs.
    Although the external corvée labor borne by the serfs of this Xika for the former Tibetan local government is not much (because they do not have their own livestock and houses, those with more livestock bear more external corvée labor), but only the construction of dikes, bridges, and houses for the Zong government often affects the production of serfs. When encountering such corvée labor, it takes at least a month, and often two or three months or even half a year.
    In order to cope with the heavy corvée labor, the serfs cannot manage their allocated land well. Sometimes, households with less labor even miss the sowing and harvesting seasons, resulting in reduced crop yields or wasteland on the allocated land. For example, Chaba Dunzhu cultivates 16 Ke 10 Sheng of allocated land, and there are only two laborers in his family, him and his wife. His wife, Gongsang, pays year-round corvée labor for the serf owner, and he himself also has to pay corvée labor for the serf owner during the busy farming season. Because they cannot manage their allocated land well, crop yields are reduced year after year, some allocated land is barren, and debts are accumulating more and more. They have to use the allocated land to pay off debts year by year. By last year, he only cultivated 1 Ke 10 Sheng of land himself. Dunzhu's situation is very common among Chaba. The serf owner tightly binds these serfs to the land through the corvée labor system.
    Corvée labor is a kind of labor rent that serfs bear to serf owners. This is a major form of exploitation by Tibetan serf owners of serfs. Ouxie's small Xika is no exception. It uses this form to cruelly exploit serfs, and the amount of exploitation is very large. Taking 1958 as an example: according to the account books of "Xinie" Ciren Wangdui, last year the serf owner planted crops on 401 Ke 19 Sheng of self-operated land, and harvested a total of 3,605 Ke 10 Sheng of grain (this is the amount that "Xinie" turned over to the serf owner Ouxie after the autumn harvest, the actual harvest must be more than this). Excluding 401 Ke 19 Sheng of seeds (not deducting livestock investment), the net gain last year was 3,203 Ke 11 Sheng. The grain harvested from the serf owner's self-operated land accounted for 77.7% of the net grain harvested from all the land in the Xika, that is to say, the amount of exploitation reached 77.7%.
    The in-kind rent for the "Boxin" (fixed rent) and "Xiexin" (sharecropping rent) land rented by the Chaba is also very high. The 14 Chaba households rented a total of 23 Ke 7 Sheng of Boxin land and 11 Ke of Xiexin land. These lands all belong to other serf owners. For Boxin land, regardless of the harvest, the general fixed rent is 3 Ke per Ke per year, and only a few lands with poor soil quality pay 1 Ke or a little more. Xiexin land is divided equally in half after the autumn harvest, with grain and grass each half. The serfs actually get much less than the lords. After deducting seeds and livestock investment, there is very little left. Regardless of Boxin land or Xiexin land, the actual rent amount after deducting seeds and serfs' livestock and labor investment often reaches as high as 70% to 80% or more.
    In this Xika, there are several serf households that do not have allocated land, but they must also pay rent every year. For example, the two Chaba families of Gengdeng and Wangdeng do not have an inch of land, but they have to pay 2 Ke of rent grain to the Zhebeng Temple every year. There is also a bizarre situation: the serf owner of this Xika gives the allocated land to the serfs to cultivate, but this land must also pay rent to another lord, and one piece of land must pay rent to two lords at the same time. For example, Chaba Caisong Zhuoma has a three-Ke of allocated land, which is the allocated land exchanged with the serf owner for year-round corvée labor, but half of the annual harvest of this three-Ke of land must also be divided equally with a lama from Zhebeng Temple. This land has actually become the Xiexin land of the temple. These inexplicable extra burdens of paying rent to two lords for one piece of land and paying rent without land endlessly squeeze the blood and sweat of the serfs.
    Debts Cannot be Repaid for Generations
    In this Xika, most of the Chaba are burdened with several old debts from decades ago. These old debts do not know how much the ancestors originally owed, how much should be repaid now, and how many years it will take to repay them. According to preliminary statistics of the debts with known amounts, the 14 Chaba households owe a total of 137 debts, including 4,011 Ke 10 Sheng of grain and 401 Cheng (one Cheng equals 50 Liang) 13 Liang of Tibetan silver, averaging 286 Ke of grain and 1,434 Liang of Tibetan silver per household.
    When serfs borrow, they must first send a Hada to request, and they must also send some gifts. Grain debts do not require collateral, but borrowing money debts must have collateral equal to or exceeding the amount of the debt. Regardless of borrowing grain debts or money debts, there must be several people as guarantors. When the borrower is unable to repay and escapes or dies, the guarantors, relatives, and neighbors will jointly bear the burden. Among the debts of these 14 Chaba households, nearly 20 debts were transferred to them because the indebted serfs escaped.
  　The interest rates on serf loans are generally very high. The prevalent usury here is borrowing five and repaying six, or borrowing six and repaying seven. There are very few cases of borrowing seven and repaying eight. The borrowing time is generally between the second and third months of the Tibetan calendar, and the debt is repaid between the ninth and tenth months; borrowing between the fifth and sixth months and repaying between the ninth and tenth months has the same high interest rate as borrowing between the second and third months.
    Most of the grain harvested by the serfs of this Xika every year is used to repay debts, and some serfs even repay all their harvests to pay off their debts. Last year, the total amount of debts repaid by the 14 Chaba households after the autumn harvest reached 695 Ke of grain, averaging 49 Ke 12 Sheng per household. The total grain harvested from all the land of these 14 Chaba households last year (including the income from mortgaged land) was only 817 Ke 9 Sheng. The grain used to repay debts accounted for more than 84% of the total income.
      Serfs Constantly Lose Allocated Land
    According to the regulations of the serf owner, when the grain debt of a serf reaches a certain number (generally 60 Ke, but sometimes less) and cannot be repaid, the land must be mortgaged. This is a more cruel exploitation method of the creditor (that is, the serf owner) against the serf, and is a robber-like plunder. The income of the serf owner from mortgaged land is often one to several times more than ordinary usury.
    For example, Chaba Suolang Zeren owes "Chijiang Larang" (that is, the management organization of the rebel Chijiang Living Buddha) 50 Ke of Qingke. This debt was borrowed by Suolang Zeren's grandfather. His grandfather and father paid interest year by year, and it is unknown how much has been repaid. Six years ago, Chijiang again asked him to mortgage 3 Ke of land. This 3 Ke of land is operated by Suolang Zeren himself with seeds and labor. Every autumn harvest, Chijiang Larang sends people to collect all the grain and grass as the annual interest to be paid. Suolang Zeren has paid like this for five years, that is, until 1957. Counting 21 Ke collected each year, a total of 105 Ke has been paid. Starting from last year, Chijiang Larang asked him to pay like this with 2 Ke of land for three years, and then hand over this 2 Ke of land to Chijiang Larang as its own, which is considered to have paid off the principal and interest. Suolang Zeren said: "This kind of debt has made me suffer too much. If it weren't for the Communist Party liberating us, this 2 Ke of land would have been taken away by Chijiang Larang after the autumn harvest next year."
    The mortgaging and pawning of land by Chaba is partly due to debt coercion, so they have to mortgage or pawn the land; partly because the corvée labor is heavy, and the Chaba cannot cultivate their allocated land; and individually, there are also mortgages or pawns due to other special reasons, such as illness or death. Serfs are constantly losing allocated land and gradually going bankrupt, and their enthusiasm for production is getting lower and lower, resulting in increasingly desolate rural production and a lack of livelihood for the people. According to the investigation, 11 out of 14 Chaba households have mortgaged or pawned land to varying degrees. These 11 Chaba households originally had 179 Ke 1 Sheng of Chaxin, Boxin, and Xiexin land, while last year they cultivated only 80 Ke 14 Sheng themselves. The land mortgaged and pawned reached 98 Ke 7 Sheng, accounting for more than 55.3% of all their land. Among them, Dunzhu cultivated less than one-tenth of his land last year, and one Chaba named Langji Dunzhu has even lost all his allocated land.
        A Large Number of Serfs Fled
    According to preliminary investigation, in the past 20 years or so, there have been 6 Chaba who fled from this Xika, accounting for almost half of the original number of Chaba. Some of them fled as recently as 1952 or 1953. The reason for their escape was that they could not afford to pay corvée labor or could not repay their debts.
    After the Chaba fled, the debts they left behind fell on the shoulders of other serfs. Among the 137 debts owed by the current 14 Chaba households, nearly 20 debts were left behind by the escaped Chaba. For example, Chaba Caisong Zhuoma was originally the daughter of Chaba Luobu Dangjia. After Jiesang fled, she took over Jiesang's Chadi from Luobu Dangjia and became the new Chaba, but at the same time, she also took over part of the debts left by Jiesang. Caisong Zhuoma has been repaying this debt for 25 years, paying a total of 300 Ke of grain, and now still owes 106 Ke, of which one debt stipulates that 8 Ke must be paid every year for another seven years; another debt stipulates that 2 Ke must be paid every year for another fifty years.
    The encounters of the escaped Chaba are very tragic. According to some Chaba who are familiar with the situation at the time, of the six escaped households, one is still missing. The other five households have all been destroyed and died in foreign lands due to hunger and cold in their wandering lives.
    Under the Tibetan serf system, Chaba were originally not allowed to separate their families. If a Chaba separated his family, except for his eldest son or eldest daughter who inherited the allocated land and remained a Chaba, those who separated could only become Duichong. At the same time, the serf owner also stipulated that the Chaba must hand over one-tenth of their property to the serf owner when separating their families. However, the large number of serfs who fled and the wasteland forced the serf owner to abandon his own regulations and separate laborers from the Chaba families to cultivate the abandoned land. These phenomena further illustrate that the serf system's brutal rule and exploitation of serfs has fundamentally shaken the system and reached its end.

    从一个庄园看西藏黑暗的农奴制度
    本报记者　袁定乾
    西藏自治区筹委会第二次全体委员会议通过的在全区进行民主改革的决议，反映了西藏广大人民迫切要求彻底废除黑暗、残酷的农奴制度的心愿。现在，拥护这一决议的呼声已经响遍了整个西藏高原。
    这里，记者介绍在一个农奴主的溪卡（庄园）中看到的情况。虽然这只不过是西藏整个农奴制社会的一个小角落，然而从这个庄园农奴的悲惨遭遇，可以了解今天西藏农奴为什么迫切要求改革，同时也可以说明彻底废除农奴制度是多么刻不容缓的事情。
  农奴主在溪卡占有一切
    这个溪卡属于叛乱分子、原西藏地方政府堪穷（四品僧官）欧协·土登桑却，在拉萨以西的东噶宗，离拉萨三十多里。全溪卡共有农奴一百三十多人，其中差巴十四户，堆穷七户，朗生十四人。这些农奴中除三户堆穷属于其他领主以外，其余都是欧协的农奴。
    农奴主欧协在溪卡里占有一切，包括全部五百九十五克十三升土地（这里的克指的是面积，下一克种子的土地称为一克地，一克约合二十五斤）和房屋，绝大部分牲畜和农具。全溪卡仅有的几台石磨，也全部为欧协所占有。
    欧协在这里的管理机构，藏语称为“雄江”，意思是“领地上的政府”。这个管理机构拥有一幢三层楼房和一幢专供欧协避暑的别墅。欧协本人并不常来溪卡，只是夏天来住一两个月，他在这个“政府”中设置了一个“溪涅”（溪卡管理人）、一个“列本”（专管农奴劳动），代他统治所有的农奴和管理溪卡的收入。
    在溪卡管理机构高大的楼房附近，有一些低矮而又破烂的平房，这就是溪卡给支差的农奴住的“差房”，许多农奴世世代代就住在这些阴暗的黑屋中。少数差巴家里有少许小牲畜和农具，而绝大多数堆穷就没什么财产，他们所有的东西只是破烂的衣物和残缺不全的食具。至于朗生，就更加悲惨了，他们多数和牲畜睡在一起，自己一无所有。
    同西藏其他大多数农奴主庄园一样，这个溪卡的土地主要是由差巴耕种。可是，全溪卡十四户差巴没一户有耕牛和犁铧，只有一些小牲畜和锄、耙、镰刀等简单农具。每年春、秋犁地时，他们要以高额租金向溪卡租来用，每架（二头）牛每天付给三十两藏银（合银元二元），还要供给耕牛饲料。一般农户仅这一项支出，每年就约需十克青稞。大部分差巴在给溪卡或欧协家里支畜差时，也必须以每头毛驴七两五钱到十两一天的租金，租用溪卡的毛驴。
      农奴的人身依附
    在农奴主欧协的账簿上，对每一户农奴的人口都有详细的记载。农奴生了子女，必须到农奴主那里登记；农奴分家或同其他领主的农奴联亲，也必须报告欧协并得到他的批准，不然就会受到惩罚。
    无论那一种农奴，除了私自逃亡以外，农奴主都不允许他们离开溪卡去作其他的谋生。农奴主需要时，都得随叫随到，不能迟延或反抗。欧协还可以随便把农奴赠送给其他农奴主甚至出卖他们，或作其他的处置。这里的差巴和朗生中，有的就是欧协从山南的另一个溪卡调来的，有的朗生以前不属于欧协，而是其他农奴主赠送或换给欧协的。
    这个溪卡有六个男朗生和八个女朗生，他们不仅世代为奴，连结婚和建立家庭的权利也没有。如朗生噶玛和规桑两姐妹都已经为欧协当了五、六十年牛马而她们从没有享受过家庭的幸福。有的朗生私自结合，有的经过“溪涅”同意后结合，但是他们结合后都不能建立一个单独的家庭。如朗生桑丹（男）和堆穷巴珠结合已经十多年，有了四个孩子，但他们仍然分别是朗生和堆穷，过去桑丹经常住在领主家里，不能和巴珠同居，更不能替巴珠干活。差巴仲堆·边巴（女）和附近江哦溪卡的一个朗生结合也好几年了，可是他们不能经常在一起同居，只能有时相互来往住上一宿。按照农奴制度的规定，凡是这个领主农奴和另一个领主农奴结合生的孩子，男孩随父，女孩随母，各为其领主所属农奴。欧协的这些农奴也要严格地遵守这条法规。
    这里的农奴和西藏其他地方一样，都被农奴主的三条锁链紧紧地束缚着，人身依附只是其中的一条。差役和高利贷这两条锁链，更使得他们终年辛勤劳动而不得温饱，甚至家破人亡。
  繁重的差役和高额的地租
    这个溪卡的全部五百九十五克十三升土地中，有三分之二是农奴主的自营地，靠农奴支差役经营。十四户差巴向农奴主支十三个常年差役，才换得一百九十三克十四升份地耕种，仅占全部土地的三分之一。种十九克份地的差巴，要支一个半常年差役；种六至九克份地就要支半个常年差役。
    支常年差役的农奴必须终年在农奴主的自营地上无偿地劳动，还要担负农奴主其他一切杂役。他们比一般农奴更没有自由，在劳动时有“列本”在旁指挥和监督，要干什么就得干什么，劳动稍一松懈就要挨打受骂。他们终年为农奴主辛勤劳动，却要自带农具和食物，农奴主连茶水也不供给。
    凡支一个常年差役的农户，每到春秋两季还要增派一个人为农奴主自营地劳动约两个月，还要租若干头驴为农奴主运送肥料、种子、粮食、草料等等。每年农事最忙的时候，也就是差役最多的时候，这时农奴必须全部出动首先为农奴主的自营地劳动，然后才能在自己的份地上工作。
    据记者初步调查，仅以农奴每年向农奴主支的主要差役平均计算，农奴种十五克十四升份地，每年负担的内差就有人工四百四十个，畜工四十个。有的差巴因所得份地较少，负担的内差就更重。如索郎泽仁，只种十克十升份地，仍要支一个常年差役，卡玛卓玛只种五克十四升份地，也要支半个常年差役。农奴主为了增加经营自营地的无偿劳动，逐年在减少农奴的份地数量，从而越来越加重了农奴的差役负担。
    这个溪卡农奴为原西藏地方政府负担的外差虽然不多（因为他们没有自己的牲畜和房屋，牲畜多的外差就支得多，但仅筑堤、修桥和给宗政府修建房屋等几项，就经常影响农奴的生产，碰上这种差，少则需时一个月，多者往往要两、三月甚至半年。
    农奴为了应付繁重的差役，便不能很好地经营自己的份地。劳动力少的农户，有时甚至错过了播种和收割季节，因而造成庄稼减产或份地荒废，例如，差巴顿珠种十六克十升份地，家中仅有他和妻子两个劳动力，妻子贡桑为农奴主支常年差役，农忙时他自己也要为农奴主支差。他们因为不能很好地经营自己的份地，庄稼年年减产，有些份地荒芜，债务也越积越多，不得不逐年用份地抵债，到去年他自己仅耕种了一克十升地。类似顿珠这种情况，在差巴中非常普遍，农奴主通过差役制度把这些农奴紧紧地束缚在土地上。
    差役是农奴向农奴主负担的一种劳役地租，这是西藏农奴主对农奴剥削的一种主要形式。在欧协这个小溪卡里也不例外，它通过这种形式，对农奴进行着残酷的剥削，剥削量是很大的。以1958年为例：据“溪涅”次仁旺堆的账簿记载，去年农奴主有四百零一克十九升自营地播种了作物，共收获粮食三千六百零五克十升（这是“溪涅”在秋后向农奴主欧协上缴的数目，实际收获量一定比此数还多），除去种子四百零一克十九升（未扣除牲畜投资），去年净得三千二百零三克十一升。农奴主自营地所收粮食，占溪卡全部土地净收粮食的77.7％，也就是说，剥削量达到77.7％。
    差巴租种的“波辛”（定额租）和“协辛”（分益租）地的实物地租，租额也是很高的。十四户差巴共租种波辛地二十三克七升，协辛地十一克，这些土地都是属于其他农奴主的。波辛地，不管收成如何，一般是每克地每年固定要交租三克，只有少数土质较差的地交一克或一克多。协辛地都是在秋后以粮草各半进行平分，农奴所得实际上比领主要少得多，扣除种子和牲畜投资，就所剩无几。无论波辛地还是协辛地，每年收获扣除种子和农奴的牲畜、人工投资，其实际地租额都往往高达70％到80％以上。
    在这个溪卡里，有几户农奴并没有份地，而他们每年也都必须缴纳地租。如更登、旺登这两家差巴，都没有一寸土地，他们每年要向哲蚌寺缴纳二克租粮。还有一种离奇的情况：这个溪卡的农奴主把份地交给农奴耕种，而这块土地又必须向另一领主交租，一块土地同时要向两个领主交租。如差巴采松卓玛有一块三克份地，是以常年差役向农奴主换来的份地，而这三克地每年的收获，又要平分一半给哲蚌寺的一个喇嘛，这块地实际上又成了寺院的协辛地。这些一块地向两个领主交租和无地而交租的莫名其妙的额外负担，无止境地榨取着农奴的血汗。
    债务世世代代还不清
    在这个溪卡里，大部分差巴都负有几笔数十年前的旧债。这些旧债既不知道祖辈原欠多少，也不知道现在该还多少，以及还要多少年才能还清。仅根据目前知道数目的债务初步统计，十四户差巴共欠债一百三十七笔，其中欠粮食四千零一十一克十升，藏银四百零一秤（一秤合五十两）十三两，平均每户欠粮二百八十六克，藏银一千四百三十四两。
    农奴借贷，要先送哈达请求，还必须送些礼物。粮债不要抵押，但借钱债就必须有相等或超过所借债款的抵押品。无论借粮债或钱债，都必须有几个人作保，借债人无力偿还而逃跑和死亡时，就由保人和亲属、邻居共同负担。现在这十四户差巴的债务中，就有近二十笔是因负债农奴逃亡后转嫁到他们身上的。
  　农奴借债的利息一般都很重。这里盛行的高利贷是借五还六、借六还七，很少有借七还八的。借债时间一般是在藏历二、三月间，到九、十月间还债；五、六月间借到九、十月间还，利息也和二、三月间借的一样高。
    这个溪卡的农奴每年收获的粮食，大部分要用来还债，有的农奴甚至全部收获都偿还了债务。去年，十四户差巴在秋收后偿还债务的总数共达六百九十五克粮食，平均每户四十九克十二升，而去年这十四户差巴的全部土地（包括典当地的收入）总共仅收粮食八百一十七克九升，用于还债的粮食占全部收入的84％以上。
      农奴不断丧失份地
    按照农奴主的规定，农奴借粮债达到一定的数字（一般是六十克，也有少一些的）而不能偿还时，就得用土地抵押。这是债主（也就是农奴主）对农奴的一种更残酷的剥削方式，是一种强盗式的掠夺。农奴主从抵押土地的收入，往往比一般高利贷要多一倍到几倍。
    例如，差巴索郎泽仁欠“赤江拉让”（即叛乱头子赤江活佛的管理机构）五十克青稞，这笔债是索郎泽仁祖父时借的，他祖父和父亲都逐年出息，已不知还了多少。六年前，赤江又要他以三克地抵押，这三克地每年由索郎泽仁出种子、人工经营，秋收时连粮带草全由赤江拉让派人来收去，作为每年应交的利息。索郎泽仁像这样交了五年，即交到1957年，以每年收二十一克计算，总共已交了一百零五克。从去年开始，赤江拉让又要他以二克地像这样交三年，然后再将这二克地交赤江拉让所有，才算本利还清。索郎泽仁说：“这种债害得我太苦了，如果不是共产党解放了我们，这二克地到明年秋收后就要被赤江拉让拿去了。”
    差巴抵押和典当土地，一部分是因为债务逼迫，不得不将土地抵债或典当；一部分则是因为差役繁重，差巴无力耕种自己的份地，个别的也有由于其他特殊原因，如疾病、死亡等而抵押或典当土地的。农奴不断丧失份地，日渐走向破产，生产热情愈来愈低，因而形成农村生产日益雕敝，民不聊生。据调查，十四户差巴中有十一户都不同程度地抵押或典当了土地。这十一户差巴原共有差辛、波辛、协辛地一百七十九克一升，而去年他们自种的仅八十克十四升，抵债和典当的土地达九十八克七升，占他们全部土地的55.3％强。其中顿珠去年自种土地不到十分之一，有一户名叫郎吉顿珠的差巴，甚至已经失去了他的全部份地。
        农奴大量逃亡
    据初步调查，近二十多年来，这个溪卡逃亡的差巴，就有六户，几乎占到原有差巴数的一半，其中有的是1952年或1953年才逃亡的。他们逃亡的原因都是因为支不起差或无力偿还债务。
    差巴逃亡后，他们遗下的债务都落到了其他农奴的身上。现在的十四户差巴所欠的一百三十七笔债务中，就有近二十笔是逃亡差巴遗留下来的。如差巴采松卓玛，原是差巴洛卜当家的女儿，在解桑逃亡后，才从洛卜当家分出接替了解桑的差地，成为新的差巴，但同时也就接收了解桑遗下的部分债务。这笔债务采松卓玛已经代还了二十五年，共交付了粮食三百克，而现在还欠一百零六克，其中一笔规定每年交八克，还要交七年；另一笔规定每年交二克，还要交五十年。
    逃亡的差巴，遭遇都是很悲惨的，据一些熟悉当时情景的差巴谈，逃亡的六户中，一户至今下落不明。其他五户都已家破人亡，在饥寒交迫的流浪生活中全家死于异乡。
    在西藏农奴制度下，本来差巴是不能分家的，如有差巴分家，除他的长子或长女继承份地仍为差巴外，分出的都只能成为堆穷。同时，农奴主还规定，差巴分家必须将其财产的十分之一上缴给农奴主。而农奴大量逃亡，土地荒芜，逼使农奴主不得不放弃自己的法规，从差巴家中分出劳动力来接种荒废了的土地。这种种现象进一步说明：农奴制度对农奴的残暴统治、压榨，已经使这种制度从根本上发生了动摇，临到了末日。
