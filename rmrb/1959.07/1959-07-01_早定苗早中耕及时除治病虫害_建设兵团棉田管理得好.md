Early Seedling Establishment, Early Middle Tillage, and Timely Prevention and Treatment of Diseases and Pests
The Construction Corps Manages Cotton Fields Well

Urumqi, July 30th (This newspaper) - The 638,000+ mu of cotton planted by the Production and Construction Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region of the People's Liberation Army are growing well due to early seedling establishment, early middle tillage, frequent middle tillage, and timely prevention and treatment of diseases and pests.

The cotton planting area of the Production and Construction Corps has expanded by more than 110,000 mu compared to last year. This year, the snowmelt period was late, and the cotton planting period in many areas was generally about ten days later than in previous years; after sowing, there were several spring rains and frosts, and the ground temperature was low. In order to ensure a bumper cotton harvest, all reclamation areas have adopted measures such as early seedling establishment, early middle tillage, and horizontal seedling establishment to promote normal growth of cotton seedlings. According to past experience, early seedling establishment plays a significant role in promoting the development and growth of seedlings and avoiding frost damage. Cotton fields with horizontal seedling establishment generally mature earlier and have higher yields. All farms began seedling establishment when the cotton seedlings first showed true leaves, and completed the seedling establishment work within five to seven days. In the Manas Reclamation Area, all farms carried out early and frequent middle tillage on weak seedlings based on local conditions, and after timely fertilization and watering, the cotton seedlings grew rapidly, and some have begun to bud. In the Aksu Reclamation Area in southern Xinjiang, the general cotton plant has four to five buds, and two to four fruit branches on more than 100,000 mu of cotton.

Since the beginning of summer, insect pests have occurred universally. All farms have conscientiously implemented the policy of "prevention is more important than cure, early treatment, small treatment, and complete treatment," extensively mobilizing the masses and adopting a combination of mechanical pesticide spraying and manual capture, as well as combining weeding and manure accumulation, setting up defenses step by step and blockades at all levels.

At present, on the basis of successfully passing the seedling management period, all farms are repairing canals and preparing for the first furrow irrigation, striving to produce more pre-autumn bolls.

### 早定苗早中耕及时除治病虫害  建设兵团棉田管理得好

    早定苗早中耕及时除治病虫害
    建设兵团棉田管理得好
    本报乌鲁木齐30日电　人民解放军新疆军区生产建设兵团种植的六十三万八千多亩棉花，由于早定苗，早中耕，勤中耕，及时除治了病虫害，生长良好。
    生产建设兵团的棉花播种面积比去年又扩大了十一万多亩。今年化雪期较晚，许多地区的棉花播种期一般都较往年晚十天左右；播种后又遇到几场春雨和霜冻，地温较低，为了保证棉花丰产，各垦区都采取早定苗、早中耕以及横向定苗等措施，促使棉苗正常生长。根据往年的经验，早定苗对促进幼苗发育生长，避免霜害的作用很大。横向定苗的棉田，一般成熟早，产量高。各农场在棉苗初现真叶时就开始定苗，五至七天内便结束了定苗工作。玛纳斯垦区各农场因地制宜地对弱苗早中耕、勤中耕，及时施肥、浇水以后，棉苗生长很快，部分已开始现蕾。南疆阿克苏垦区十多万亩棉花一般每株已现蕾四至五个，果枝二至四个。
    入夏以来，虫害普遍发生，各农场都认真贯彻了“防重于治、治早、治小、治了”的方针，广泛发动群众，采取器械药杀和人工捕捉并重，除草和积肥相结合的方法，步步设防，层层封锁。
    目前，各农场在胜利度过幼苗期管理的基础上，正在整修渠道，准备第一次隔沟灌溉，力争多座伏前桃。
