Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 15th: Amidst the high enthusiasm of the workers in the production increase and economy drive, Huainan Coal Mine is caring for and arranging the lives of its workers in various ways, ensuring that they eat well, sleep well, and rest well.

All mines are actively carrying out heat prevention and cooling work. To date, a total of 58 cool sheds for workers to rest have been built, 194 tea buckets and water tanks have been set up, more than 1,000 catties of cooling drinks have been purchased, and some ice-making equipment has been added. At the same time, each mine has trained 256 first-aid health workers, set up 33 health kits and medicine distribution points, and prepared a large number of heatstroke prevention drugs such as Rendan and Ten Drops of Water. All mines have adopted measures such as natural ventilation, mechanical ventilation, spraying water, and isolating heat sources to reduce the temperature in high-temperature workplaces such as boiler rooms, winding engine rooms, compressed air machine rooms, canteens, and coking plants. In terms of open-air operations, the mines have adjusted the working hours of large-shift workers, generally changing them to 5:00 am to 9:00 am and 2:00 pm to 7:00 pm, extending the lunch break. In order to ensure the rest of the three-shift workers underground, the mines have also stipulated that no meetings will be held after get off work, and the meeting time will be placed before work to reduce the meeting time, so that workers can rest after get off work.

In order to ensure that workers can sleep well and rest well, the mines have further strengthened the management of employee dormitories and newly built and repaired a batch of employee dormitories in a simple and economical way. All mines actively organize canteen employees to carry out the "Five Good" competition, summarize and promote experience, and run the canteens well. The mines also actively carry out sideline production, such as growing vegetables and raising poultry, to improve the lives of employees.

This newspaper reports: The Benxi Mining Bureau has universally implemented a system of delivering meals underground in all its coal mines. More than 6,400 coal mining and tunneling workers in the entire mining area can eat a sweet and nutritious meal during their work hours underground every day. This is welcomed by the workers and promotes production.

After liberation, Benxi's coal mines made many efforts to solve the problem of eating for underground workers, and at one time implemented underground meal delivery. However, due to the failure to solve some specific problems, it could not be sustained. In the vigorous battle to seize coal, the Benxi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China grasped both production and livelihood, requiring the mining area party committee to earnestly solve this problem, and at the same time instructing relevant departments to solve the problem of supplying the main and subsidiary foods for nutritious meals. In order to realize the delivery of meals underground, the secretaries of the party committees of each mine personally took charge, built houses, installed steam boilers, and transferred personnel to establish a nutritious canteen. At the same time, each mine is also equipped with manpower to deliver meals. Now this meal delivery system has become regular. Every day, according to the different working hours of the three shifts, it is delivered three times by a dedicated person carrying meals to the workface. The workers are very satisfied to eat a hot and palatable health meal in the middle of their work. Some workers said: The Party cares for us so much, and we can still eat hot meals underground, so we have to work harder. (Ma Xueji)

    切实关心煤矿工人生活
    淮南各煤矿加强防暑降温改善食宿条件
    本溪采掘工人每天可在井下吃到保健饭
    新华社合肥15日电　淮南煤矿在职工们热情高涨的增产节约运动中，多方地关心和安排职工生活，使职工们吃好、睡好、休息好。
    各矿正在积极进行防暑降温工作，到目前为止，共已修建供工人休息的凉棚五十八处，设立茶桶水缸一百九十四个，购买了一千多斤清凉饮料，添置了一些制冰设备。同时，各矿训练了急救保健员二百五十六人，设立了保健箱和发药点三十三处，准备好了大批人丹、十滴水等防暑药品。各矿对锅炉房、绞车房、压风机房、食堂、炼焦等高温作业场所，都采取自然通风、机械通风、喷雾洒水和隔绝热源等措施，降低温度。在露天作业方面，矿上已调整了大班工人的工作时间，一般都改为上午五时至九时和下午二时至七时，延长了中午的休息时间。为了保证井下三班作业工人的休息，各矿也都规定下班上井后不开会，把开会时间放在上班前，减少会议时间，这样工人下班后就可以休息。
    为了保证工人能睡好和休息好，各矿还进一步加强了职工宿舍的管理，因陋就简地新建和修建了一批职工宿舍。各矿都积极组织食堂职工开展五好竞赛，总结和推广经验，办好食堂。各矿还积极开展副业生产，如种菜和饲养家禽等，改善职工生活。
      本报讯　本溪矿务局各煤矿普遍实行井下送饭制度，全矿区六千四百多名采煤和掘进工人每天都可以在井下作业时间内吃到一次香甜的保健饭，受到工人的欢迎，推动了生产。
    解放后，本溪各煤矿为解决井下工人吃饭问题曾经作过不少次努力，一度实行过井下送饭。但是由于某些具体问题没有解决，没能坚持下去。在轰轰烈烈的夺煤大战中，中共本溪市委在抓生产的同时把生活也抓起来了，要求矿区党委认真解决这个问题，同时指示有关部门解决保健饭的主副食供应问题。为实现井下送饭，各矿党委书记亲自挂帅，盖房子、安汽锅、抽调人员建立起保健食堂。同时，各矿还配备了送饭的人力。现在这种送饭制度已经经常化，每天，按三班不同工作时间，分三次由专人背着饭菜送到掌子里。工人在干活中间吃到一顿热的适口的保健饭，非常满意。有的工人说：党对我们这样关怀，在井下还能吃热饭，更要加油干了。　（马学吉）
