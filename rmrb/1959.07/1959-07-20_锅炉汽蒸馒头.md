Steaming Mantou with Boiler Steam
He Shouli, a master worker in the boiler room of the West Railway Station of the Xi'an Railway Bureau, and young boiler workers Zhou Yin'an and Chen Dexin, have successfully experimented with using boiler steam to steam mantou. They used pipes welded from old iron pipes to connect the hot air directly from the boiler room to the kitchen stove. This can save four and a half tons of coal per month, and also save the consumption of blowers and electricity. The steaming time for mantou is also halved compared to the past.

    锅炉汽蒸馒头
    西安铁路局西车站锅炉房何守礼老师傅和青年锅炉工周银安、陈德新等，试用锅炉汽蒸馒头成功。他们用旧铁管焊接成的管子把热气由锅炉房直通厨房锅灶。这样一个月就可以少用四吨半煤，还可以省掉鼓风机和电力的消耗。蒸馒头时间也比过去缩短一半。
