Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 26th - Shandong is beginning to sow autumn vegetables in various areas. This year, the province plans to sow five million mu of autumn vegetables, an increase of more than 20% over last year. The sowing area of ​​Jiaozhou cabbage, Zhangqiu scallions, and Weixian radishes, which are famous throughout the country, has increased compared with last year. In order to strive to achieve complete or partial self-sufficiency in vegetables, the sowing area of ​​vegetables in various cities and industrial and mining areas has increased by one to two times compared with last year.

All counties in the province have strengthened leadership in vegetable production. Jiao County, which produces "Jiaozhou Cabbage," has established vegetable production committees or leading groups from the county to the production team, and began preparing for sowing in June.

Various localities have also tried to help people's communes solve the difficulties of insufficient fertilizer and seeds. Commercial departments in many places have adopted methods such as mobile purchases and holding small-scale cooperation and exchange meetings to solve the problem of seed adjustment. Qingdao, Yantai, Jinan, and Linyi regions have mutually adjusted and supported fraternal counties with more than 390,000 jin of cabbage and radish seeds.

In order to support rural vegetable production, the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee organizes more than 3,000 cadres, factory employees, and citizens every day to help Jiao County and Jimo, the main vegetable producing areas, to turn over the land and prepare the ridges. Relevant departments in Jinan have sent a group of cadres to help suburban areas produce chemical fertilizers. In addition to sending cadres to various places to summarize vegetable cultivation experience, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Science Research Department have also established experimental fields for six kinds of vegetables, including cabbage, scallions, garlic, and radishes, in Jiao County, Zhangqiu, Weifang and other counties and cities, preparing to promote advanced cultivation experience and vegetable field management systems.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 26th - Various parts of Jilin Province have generally started sowing autumn vegetables earlier than usual. Some areas have already completed the task of sowing autumn vegetables such as radishes and cabbage.

This year, the province plans to sow more than 2.8 million mu of autumn vegetables, an increase of 45% over last year. Various localities are also actively expanding the area of ​​multiple cropping and mixed cropping, and making full use of idle land to grow autumn vegetables. After Jilin City implemented the nearly 60,000 mu of autumn vegetable sowing plan indicators to production teams and groups, it quickly set off a high tide of sowing autumn vegetables. The autumn vegetable sowing time of the people's communes in the suburbs of Changchun City was ten days earlier than in previous years. Rural people's communes have also increased the sowing area of ​​autumn vegetables this year.

In vegetable production, various localities have also paid attention to improving technology and improving sowing quality; some localities have also conducted seed disinfection and germination tests.

    山东、吉林开始播种秋菜
    播种面积将比去年扩大
    新华社济南26日电　山东各地开始播种秋菜。今年全省计划播种秋菜五百万亩，比去年扩大20％以上。闻名全国的胶州大白菜、章丘大葱、潍县萝卜的播种面积都比去年有增加。各个城市和工矿区，为了力争达到全部或部分蔬菜自给，今年蔬菜的播种面积都比去年增加一至二倍。
    全省各县都加强了蔬菜生产的领导。出产“胶州大白菜”的胶县从县到生产队都成立蔬菜生产委员会或领导小组，并且从6月份就开始作播种准备工作。
    各地还设法帮助人民公社解决肥料、种籽不足的困难。许多地方的商业部门采取流动收购和召开小型协作交流会议的方法，解决调剂种籽。青岛、烟台、济南、临沂四个地区互相调剂和支援兄弟县的白菜、萝卜种子达三十九万多斤。
    为支援农村蔬菜生产，中共青岛市委每天组织机关、工厂职工和市民三千多人帮助蔬菜主要产地的胶县、即墨翻地、整畦。济南市有关部门派出一批干部帮助郊区生产化肥。省农业厅和农业科学研究部门除派干部到各地总结蔬菜栽培经验外，还在胶县、章丘、潍坊等县市，建立了白菜、葱、蒜、萝卜等六种蔬菜试验田，准备推广先进的栽培经验和菜田管理制度。
    新华社长春26日电　吉林省各地普遍提前播种秋菜。有些地方播种萝卜、白菜等秋菜的任务已经完成。
    今年全省计划播种秋菜二百八十多万亩，比去年增加45％，各地还积极扩大复种、混种面积，并充分利用空闲地种植秋菜。吉林市把近六万亩秋菜播种计划指标落实到生产队、小组以后，很快掀起了播种秋菜高潮。长春市郊各人民公社，秋菜播种时间比往年提前了十天。农村人民公社今年也增加了秋菜播种面积。
    各地在蔬菜生产中，还注意改进技术提高播种质量；有些地方还作了种子消毒和发芽试验等。
