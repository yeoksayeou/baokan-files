Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 25th: Chongqing is accelerating the speed of coal mine construction, striving to complete and put into production the five pairs of large and medium-sized mines currently under construction and renovation in the second half of this year.

These five pairs of mines are the newly built Zhongliangshan North Mine, Yanshantai Coal Mine, Yutianpu Coal Mine No. 2 well, and the renovated Tianfu Coal Mine South Well, and Nantong Coal Mine No. 2 well. Calculated according to design capacity, the total annual output of these five pairs of mines is equivalent to more than 80% of Chongqing's total coal output last year.

The Zhongliangshan North Mine is the largest pair of newly built mines in the Chongqing area. Now, the workers are determined to complete this mine by the end of September this year and ensure good project quality. A labor competition centered on high output, high quality, high work efficiency, low cost, and ensuring safety is underway in this mine. The workers have learned and promoted rapid tunneling experience such as working according to cycle charts, multi-cycle parallel and cross-operations, as well as the experience of multi-loading and fast transportation, which greatly improved labor efficiency. Many cadres went deep into the construction site to eat, live, and work with the workers, and solve various problems in construction together with the workers. Technicians also helped the workers implement technical operating procedures on the construction site. Since July, the tunneling speed of this mine has gradually increased, and on July 15, it increased from 30 to 35 meters per day before the 10th to 45.2 meters.

The workers building the other four pairs of mines are also vigorously carrying out technical innovation, promoting advanced experiences such as rapid tunneling, multi-loading and fast transportation, and rational organization of labor, to accelerate the progress of mine construction. In order to ensure the early completion of these mines, the relevant departments have taken corresponding measures in terms of raw material supply, transportation, and power supply.

    尽快为煤炭战线增添生力军
    重庆五对大中型煤井加速建设
    新华社重庆25日电　重庆市加快煤矿建设速度，争取正在新建和改建的五对大中型矿井在今年下半年建成投入生产。
    这五对矿井是新建的中梁山北矿、砚石台煤矿、鱼田堡煤矿二号井和改建的天府煤矿南井、南桐煤矿二号井。按照设计能力计算，这五对矿井的总年产量相当去年重庆全部煤炭产量的80％以上。
    中梁山北矿矿井是重庆地区新建矿井中最大的一对。现在职工们决心把这个矿井在今年9月底建成，并且保证工程质量良好。一个以高产、高质、高工效、低成本和保证安全为中心的劳动竞赛，正在这个矿井展开。职工们学习和推广了按循环图表作业、多循环平行交叉作业等快速掘进经验，以及多装快运的经验，大大提高了劳动效率。许多干部深入工地与工人同吃、同住、同劳动，同工人一起解决施工中的各种问题。技术人员也在工地上帮助工人贯彻执行技术操作规程。7月份以来，这个矿井的巷道掘进速度即逐步上升，7月15日更由10日以前的日进三十至三十五米提高到四十五点二米。
    建设其他四对矿井的职工，也大闹技术革新，推广快速掘进、多装快运、合理组织劳动力等先进经验，加快建井进度。为了保证这几对矿井提前建成，有关部门在原料材料供应、交通运输、电力供应等方面，都采取了相应的措施。
