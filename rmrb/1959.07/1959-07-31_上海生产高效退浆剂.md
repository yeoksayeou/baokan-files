Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 30th—The Shanghai Light Industry Research Institute recently successfully developed a high-efficiency desizing agent – amylase. Desizing can be completed in just three to five minutes, and the texture of the desized grey cloth is good, and the color is pure white. The effect is better than using caustic soda, creating very good conditions for the continuous production of the printing and dyeing industry in the future.

Amylase is starch enzyme, which is made from corn flour and soybean cake. It contains protease, so it can also be used in the leather, alcohol, silk reeling, and paper industries. After ugly pigskin is softened with amylase, the pits and wrinkles on the surface of the skin become smooth and flat, almost like sheepskin.

Currently, the Light Industry Research Institute has successfully developed liquid amylase, and they are further researching powdered preparations. Liquid amylase is already in formal production.

    上海生产高效退浆剂
    据新华社上海30日电　不久前，上海轻工业研究所研究成功一种高效率的退浆剂——淀粉酶，只需三、五分钟便能退浆，而且退浆后的坯布质地好，色泽纯白，效果比烧碱好，为今后印染工业生产连续化创造了很好的条件。
    淀粉酶就是淀粉酵素，是利用玉米粉和豆饼作原料制成，里面含有蛋白酶，因此，它还可以用在皮革、酒精、缫丝和造纸工业等方面。丑陋的猪皮经过淀粉酶软化后，皮面上的麻粒和皱纹变得平整、光滑，和羊皮差不多。
    目前，轻工业研究所研究成功的是液态淀粉酶，他们还在进一步研究粉态制剂。液态淀粉酶已正式生产。
