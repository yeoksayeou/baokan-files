Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, July 13th. The Ewenki Autonomous Banner in Inner Mongolia held the Nadaam Fair (i.e., a material exchange fair) to celebrate the first bumper livestock harvest since the communization and to welcome the first anniversary of the establishment of the autonomous banner. In the temporarily set up tent market, more than two thousand herders of the Ewenki, Daur, Mongolian and other ethnic groups, dressed in festive costumes, bustled about. After selling their fat cattle and strong horses, wool, and hides, they eagerly selected their favorite items such as cloth, silk, and gold and silver ornaments. The transaction volume of the conference in three days reached 60,600 yuan. During the conference, horse racing, wrestling, ball games and other competitions were also held, wonderful cultural programs and films were performed, and various exhibitions were held.

The Ewenki Autonomous Banner was established on August 1st last year. Under the leadership of the Party, various construction undertakings in the autonomous banner have advanced by leaps and bounds in the past year. Last year, the entire banner realized people's communization, which opened up broad avenues for the high-speed development of the animal husbandry economy. According to incomplete statistics from late June, more than 39,000 head of various young animals have been delivered throughout the banner, with a survival rate of 97.5%. Last year, more than 3,000 small factories were established throughout the banner to directly serve livestock production and herders' lives. The purchasing power of herders in the banner has increased from an average of 24.4 yuan per person in 1952 to 173 yuan in 1958, an increase of nearly seven times in six years. In the past, the Ewenki people, who were entirely engaged in nomadic life, have now mostly realized settlement, and the population is also increasing year by year. In 1949, only 25 babies were born in the banner, while in 1957, 339 babies were born, an increase of twelve times compared to 1949. In 1958, 90% of school-age children in the banner entered elementary school, and the number of people entering middle school and university also increased year by year. (Attached picture)

    庆祝公社化后第一个牧业大丰收
    鄂温克举行那达慕大会
    新华社呼和浩特13日电　内蒙古鄂温克族自治旗举行那达慕大会（即物资交流大会），庆祝公社化以后的第一个牧业大丰收和迎接自治旗建立一周年。在临时组成的帐篷市场上，穿着节日盛装的两千多名鄂温克、达斡尔、蒙古等民族的牧民，熙攘往来。他们卖出了肥牛壮马、羊毛、皮张以后，纷纷选购布匹、绸缎和金银饰品等心爱的东西，大会三天的交易额即达六万零六百多元。大会期间，还举行了赛马、摔跤、球类等比赛，演出了精采的文艺节目和电影，举办了各种展览会。
    鄂温克族自治旗是去年8月1日成立的。一年来，在党的领导下，自治旗各项建设事业突飞猛进。去年，全旗实现了人民公社化，为高速度发展畜牧业经济开辟了广阔道路。到6月下旬的不完全统计，全旗已接产各类仔畜三万九千多头，成活率达到97.5％。去年全旗建立了三千多个直接为牧业生产和牧民生活服务的各种小型工厂。全旗牧民的购买力已由1952年平均每人二十四元四角提高到1958年的一百七十三元，在六年内增长将近七倍多。过去完全从事游牧生活的鄂温克人，现在大部分已实现了定居，人口也在逐年上升。1949年全旗只有二十五个婴儿出生，而1957年出生的婴儿有三百三十九个，比1949年增加十二倍。1958年，全旗90％的适龄儿童进了小学，升入中学和大学的人数也逐年增加。（附图片）
