    Congratulations on the Large-Scale Bumper Wheat Harvest

    The wheat harvesting work has basically ended across the country. After the hard work of last winter and this spring, the farmers have reaped bountiful fruits. According to the materials already obtained, this year, the wheat yield per unit area in various places, except for a few areas that have suffered from natural disasters and reduced production, has generally increased by 10% to 30% compared with last year. A few areas that were originally low-yielding in wheat or that were particularly well-managed have also had greater increases. The first battle on the agricultural front this year—the winter wheat bumper harvest campaign—has achieved a major victory.

    The salient feature of this year's wheat bumper harvest campaign is the widespread emergence of large-scale bumper harvest fields across the country. There are many production teams with an average yield of more than 600 jin per mu on thousands of mu, communes with an average yield of more than 500 jin per mu on tens of thousands of mu, and counties with tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of mu yielding more than 400 jin per mu. This is the result of summarizing the experience of last year's high-yield experimental fields, establishing many "bumper harvest squares" or "bumper harvest zones," and conscientiously implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture.

    The large-scale wheat bumper harvest fields that have appeared this year are of greater significance than last year's small-area high-yield experimental fields. China has a large population and little arable land, and the current material and technical conditions do not allow for the large-scale reclamation of wasteland. Therefore, the direction of efforts to increase grain is to try every possible means to increase yield per unit area. Since liberation, the yield per unit area of ​​grain crops in my country has increased year by year; however, before last year, the increase was relatively small. Further increasing the yield per unit area has become a key issue in rapidly increasing China's grain output. Last year, cadres and farmers in many regions of the country broke superstitions, emancipated their minds, and carried out high-yield experiments on small plots of land. People have taken unconventional measures in these small-area high-yield experimental fields, some of which have proven to be correct and successful, while others have been incorrect and failed. Among the successful measures, some can be universally promoted; others are limited by China's current technical conditions, or due to excessive production costs and labor input, and even investments higher than income, and therefore cannot be promoted. These experiments, whether successful or failed, and whether they can be promoted or not, have provided important experience and lessons for this year's large-scale bumper harvest campaign of summer crops.

    This year's large-scale wheat bumper harvest was developed on the basis of last year's high-yield experimental fields. Generally speaking, the successful and promotable experiences from last year's experimental fields have been accepted, and the bad experiences have been discarded. It can be said that this year's large-scale wheat bumper harvest is more comprehensive and reasonable in implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture. For example, not only attention is paid to implementing rational close planting, but also to rational deep plowing and rational fertilization adapted to rational close planting. More attention is also paid to economic accounting and cost calculation. This means that the application of the "Eight-Point Charter" is more in line with scientific requirements.

    This year's large-scale wheat bumper harvest shows that conscientiously implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" can not only achieve high yields on small plots of land, but also achieve relatively large bumper harvests on large areas. The 10,000 mu of wheat connected by the Old City and Zhai Town in Yanshi County, Henan, yielded an average of 603 jin per mu. Pucheng, Hancheng, Dali and other counties in the eastern part of Weibei, Shaanxi Province, which are known as the Great Drought Plain, have always had very low wheat yields. This year, the low-yield situation has been completely changed, and the wheat has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with a yield equivalent to the total grain output of last summer and autumn. Recalling this time last year, some people doubted that it was possible to achieve high yields on small plots of land, but it was impossible to achieve high yields on large areas; it was possible to obtain large-scale bumper harvests on fertile land, but it was impossible to obtain large-scale bumper harvests on barren land. This year's fact of large-scale wheat bumper harvests in various places convincingly proves that under China's current agricultural technical conditions, it is entirely possible to continue to maintain an increase rate of more than 10% in grain output by implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" in accordance with local conditions and through hard work.

    It should be pointed out that an annual increase of 10% in agricultural production is already a very high speed, which has broken through the usual rate of increase. Because the rate of increase in agricultural production has certain limits, especially under China's current economic and technical conditions. It is wrong to say that large-scale increases in production cannot be achieved without mechanization and chemical fertilizers. This has been proven by the facts of last year's great leap forward in agriculture and this year's wheat bumper harvest. However, it should also be admitted that it is impossible to deeply plow all the land to more than one foot before full agricultural mechanization is achieved. It is also impossible to have sufficient labor in rural areas and to rapidly increase agricultural labor productivity. At the same time, in order to greatly increase grain production, it is necessary to correspondingly increase fertilizer. "Crops are a flower, all rely on fertilizer," and "no ten thousand dan of fertilizer, it is difficult to harvest ten thousand jin of grain." This is the summary of farmers' experience for thousands of years. At present, my country cannot produce large quantities of chemical fertilizers, and there is a certain limit to farm manure. Therefore, the rate of increase in grain production is limited. During the first five-year plan, the growth rate of agricultural production averaged just over 4% per year. Therefore, it should be said that an annual increase of 10% is a leap forward, an increase of 20% is a great leap forward, and an increase of 30% is an especially great leap forward. The idea that agricultural production can be increased by multiples every year is unrealistic; the idea that only an increase by multiples counts as a great leap forward is unscientific. This year's 10% to 30% increase in wheat yield per unit area in many places is undoubtedly a great achievement. Of course, it must also be pointed out that this year, many places reduced the sown area of ​​summer crops when cultivating large-scale "bumper harvest squares" or "bumper harvest zones." Therefore, although the yield per unit area increased, the total output did not increase much. This is an important lesson. Under China's current economic and technical conditions, while cultivating large-scale bumper harvest fields, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of multiple planting and multiple harvesting, and not only increase the yield per unit area, but also increase the total output. "Less planting and more harvesting" is the long-term vision of China's agricultural development, and in the next few years, especially in the next three years, it is still necessary to implement "multiple planting, high yield, and multiple harvesting." At the same time, when cultivating large-scale bumper harvest fields, attention should also be paid to economic accounting, strive to reduce costs, and improve labor productivity.

    The large-scale wheat bumper harvest is a great joy for the people of the whole country. The arrival of new grain will undoubtedly be of great benefit to the supply of grain. However, as the CPC Central Committee and the State Council have instructed, "It must be remembered that no matter when, no matter how great a harvest is obtained, the principles of planned distribution, planned consumption, and long-term planning cannot be changed." "Whether in cities or villages, grain consumption should be forward-looking and long-term, and think of poor harvests when there are good harvests, and think of next year when thinking about this year." It must not be thought that because the summer harvest is good and there is more grain, it can be wasted casually. It is necessary to arrange the consumption of grain in a planned way and strive to complete the state's procurement plan. While celebrating the wheat harvest, we must continue to work hard to ensure a bumper harvest of early rice and strive for a greater bumper harvest of autumn crops. (Attached pictures)

### 祝小麦大面积丰收

    祝小麦大面积丰收
    全国各地麦收工作基本结束了。农民们经过去冬今春的辛勤劳动，已经收获到丰硕的果实。根据已经得到的材料，今年各地小麦单位面积产量，除少数地区因遭受自然灾害而减产外，一般都比去年提高10％到30％。少数原来是小麦低产的地区或者经营得特别好的地区，也有幅度更大的增产。今年农业战线上的第一个战役——冬麦丰产运动，已经取得了重大的胜利。
    今年小麦丰产运动的显著特点，是全国各地广泛地出现了大面积丰产田，有许多上千亩平均亩产六百斤以上的生产队、上万亩亩产五百斤以上的公社和几万亩、几十万亩亩产四百斤以上的县。这是总结了去年高额丰产试验田的经验，建立了许多“丰产方”或“丰产区”，认真贯彻执行了农业“八字宪法”的结果。
    今年出现的小麦大面积丰产田，比去年的小面积的高产试验田，有更加重大的意义。我国人口多，耕地少，目前的物质条件技术条件又不允许大量开垦荒地，因此，增加粮食的努力方向是千方百计地提高单位面积产量。解放以来，我国粮食作物的单位面积产量逐年有所提高；但是在去年以前，增加的幅度还比较小。更大地提高单位面积产量，就成为迅速增加我国粮食产量的关键问题。去年全国许多地区的干部和农民，破除迷信，解放思想，在小块土地上进行了高额丰产的试验。人们在这些小面积高额丰产试验田里，采取了打破常规的措施，其中有的措施证明是正确的，成功的，有的则是不正确的，失败了的。在成功的措施中，有的是可以普遍推广的；也有的限于我国目前的技术条件，或者由于投入的生产费用和劳动力过多，甚至投资高于收入，因而不能推广的。这些试验，不管是成功或是失败，也不管是能否推广，都给今年夏收作物的大面积丰产运动提供了重要的经验和教训。
    今年的小麦大面积丰产，是在去年高额丰产试验田的基础上发展起来的。一般说来，去年试验田中成功的、可以推广的经验，接受下来了，不好的经验，被抛弃了。可以说，今年小麦大面积丰产，在贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”上，更加全面更加合理了。例如，不只注意实行合理密植，而且注意同合理密植相适应的合理深耕、合理施肥。也比较注意经济核算，计算成本。这也就是说，在运用“八字宪法”上，更加符合科学的要求了。
    今年的小麦大面积丰收表明：认真贯彻执行“八字宪法”，不仅可以在小块土地上高额丰产，而且在大面积上同样可以获得比较大的丰产。河南偃师县的老城和翟镇连成一片的万亩小麦，平均亩产六百零三斤。被称为大旱原的陕西省渭北东部的蒲城、韩城、大荔等县，小麦产量一向很低，今年完全改变了低产面貌，小麦获得空前大丰收，产量抵上了去年夏秋两季粮食的总产量。回忆去年这个时候，有些人曾经怀疑：在小块土地上取得高产是可能的，在大面积上要取得高产是不可能的；在肥沃的土地上可以得到大面积丰产，在贫瘠的土地上就不能得到大面积丰产。今年各地小麦大面积丰收的事实，令人信服地证明，在我国目前的农业技术条件下，因地制宜地贯彻执行“八字宪法”，经过辛勤的劳动，使粮食产量继续保持增产10％以上的跃进速度是完全可能的。
    应当指出，农业每年增产10％已经是很高的速度了，已经突破通常的递增速度了。因为，农业增产速度是有一定限度的，在我国目前经济技术条件下更是如此。没有机械化和化学肥料就不能大量增产的说法是不对的，这已被去年农业大跃进和今年小麦丰收的事实所证明了。但是，也应当承认，在全部实行农业机械化之前，要想使所有的土地都深翻到一尺以上，是不可能的。要使农村有充裕的劳动力，要迅速提高农业的劳动生产率，也是不可能的。同时要粮食大量增产，必须相应地增加肥料。“庄稼一朵花，全靠肥当家”，“没有万担肥，难收万斤粮”，这是农民几千年来经验的总结。现在我国还不能大量生产化学肥料，而农家肥又有一定的限度。因此，粮食的增产速度就受到一定的限制。第一个五年计划期间，农业生产增长的速度是每年平均增长4％多一点。因此，应该说，每年增长10％就是跃进，增长20％就是大跃进，增长30％更是特大跃进了。认为农业生产年年都能够成倍地增产的想法，是不现实的；认为只有成倍地增产才算是大跃进的想法，是不科学的。今年许多地方的小麦的单位面积产量增长10％到30％，无疑是一个伟大的成绩。当然，也必须指出，今年许多地方在培植大面积的“丰产方”或“丰产区”的时候，减少了夏收作物的播种面积，因此，虽然单位面积增产了，但总产量增加不多。这是一个重要的教训。在目前我国经济技术条件下，在培植大面积丰产田的同时，必须坚持多种多收的方针，不仅要提高单位面积产量，而且要提高总产量。“少种多收”是我国农业发展的远景，而在若干年内，特别是最近三年内还必须实行“多种高产多收”。同时，在培植大面积丰产田的时候，还要注意经济核算，努力降低成本，提高劳动生产率。
    小麦大面积丰收，这是全国人民一大喜事。新粮登场，对于粮食的供应无疑有很大的好处。但是，正如中共中央、国务院所指示的，“必须记住，无论什么时候，无论获得多么大的丰收，计划分配、计划消费、长期打算的原则是不能改变的”。“无论城市和乡村，在粮食消费上都应当瞻前顾后，细水长流，丰收的时候想到歉收，今年想到明年。”决不可以认为夏季丰收了，粮食多了，就可以随便浪费。必须有计划地安排粮食的食用和努力完成国家的征购计划。在庆祝小麦丰收的时候，我们要继续努力保证早稻的丰收和争取秋季作物的更大的丰收。（附图片）
