Xinhua News Agency, Prague Telegram: Czechoslovakia's total capital construction workload this year will be 12% higher than last year, and the construction investment directly controlled by the central government has increased by more than 30%. National funds will be concentrated on metallurgy, power, chemical, and fuel industries, which are the foundation for the development of the national economy.

In order to promote the further development of productive forces and completely reverse the phenomenon that the raw material industry cannot fully meet the needs of the processing industry, Czechoslovakia is vigorously accelerating the pace of capital construction this year, especially the development of the power industry and raw material bases. Among the 168 industrial projects built with central investment, there are coal mines, power stations, a blast furnace, two open-hearth furnaces, as well as chemical and building materials factories, which will be put into production this year. This year, the number of houses built solely with state investment will be 30% more than the total number of houses built by the state and individuals last year.

In the coal and steel center of Ostrava State, half of this year's capital construction projects are used to expand fuel and metallurgical bases. The construction of an automated rolling mill, the largest in Central Europe, and a most modern coal washing plant is underway. The Koncize Steel Plant is also building two new steel plants with the help of experts from the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic. In addition, two large coal mines are under construction, and another large coal mine is in the preparation stage for construction. After these three most modern coal mines, which produce several thousand tons per day, are put into production, almost all of the coal will be mined using coal mining combines.

In Brno State, a new telecommunications equipment factory is under construction. Once completed, the factory will produce 73 million crowns worth of telecommunications equipment annually. Modern chemical factories and building materials factories are also under construction in this state.

At present, capital construction projects are proceeding intensively throughout the country, and some projects have been completed in the first half of this year. In the first quarter alone, equipment with an annual output of 5,000 tons of steel, a chemical industry with an annual output of 8,200 tons of sulfuric acid, and 150,000 kilowatts of power equipment were put into production.

    捷大力加速基本建设的步伐
    国家资金集中用于冶金和动力等工业
    据新华社布拉格电　捷克斯洛伐克今年基本建设的总工作量比去年要多12％，由中央政府直接掌握的建设投资增加了30％以上。国家资金将集中用于作为国民经济发展基础的冶金、动力、化学和燃料工业。
    为了促进生产力的进一步发展，并彻底扭转原材料工业不能完全适应加工工业需要的现象，捷克斯洛伐克今年正大力加速基本建设的步伐，特别是电力工业和原料基地的发展。在中央投资兴建的一百六十八个工业项目中，包括今年将投入生产的煤矿、电站、一座高炉、两座平炉以及化工和建筑材料工厂等。今年单由国家投资兴建的住宅就要比去年由国家和个人投资兴建的住宅的总建筑量多30％。
    在煤钢中心俄斯特拉发州，今年基本建设工程的一半是用于扩建燃料和冶金基地。一座中欧最大的自动化轧钢厂和一座最现代化的洗煤厂正在动工兴建。孔齐泽钢铁厂也正在苏联和德意志民主共和国专家的帮助下修建两座新的钢材厂。此外，两座大型煤矿正在紧张修建中，另一座大型煤矿在进行修建的准备工作。这三座日产数千吨的最现代化的煤矿投入生产后，将几乎全部利用采煤康拜因开采。
    在布尔诺州，一个新的电讯设备制造厂正在动工兴建，这个工厂建成后，将年产价值七千三百万克朗的电讯设备。这个州正在兴建的还有现代化的化学工厂和建筑材料工厂。
    目前，全国各地的基本建设工程正在紧张进行中，今年上半年已有一些工程完工。仅在第一季度中就有年产五千吨钢的设备，年产八千二百吨硫酸的化学工业以及十五万瓩的电力设备投入生产。
