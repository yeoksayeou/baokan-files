A Sign of the Decline of US Hegemony in the Western World
American Gold Flows Out in Torrents
National Treasury Reserves Reduced to Lowest Point in Twenty Years

(Dispatch from our reporter, Wan Guang) The headline "American Gold Continues to Flow Out in Large Quantities" appears frequently in American and Western European newspapers. Americans are discussing it with anxiety and uneasiness, while Western Europeans are watching with secret glee.

The gold reserves in the US treasury have now sharply declined to their lowest point in twenty years. In the past year and the first half of this year, US gold reserves have decreased by a total of more than $3.1 billion. As of July 1, they had fallen to $19.7 billion, which is approximately 20% (or $4.6 billion) less than the postwar peak record of US gold reserves.

The majority of the gold lost by the United States has flowed to Western European countries such as Britain and West Germany. The United States once accounted for 70% of the total gold reserves in the capitalist world, but this has now fallen to 50%. This is a significant sign of the intensification of unbalanced development among capitalist countries and the decline of US hegemony in the Western world.

Currently, foreign governments, banks, and private individuals hold more than $15 billion in reserves. If these dollar reserves were all exchanged for gold at the US treasury, the remaining US reserves would be insufficient to meet the legal gold reserve requirements for dollars and American banks.

The reasons for the weakening of the US position in gold reserves are multifaceted. The US international balance of payments deficit has grown substantially in the past year. Faced with the US economic crisis and the unreliability of the dollar, other countries that receive dollars have been eagerly converting them into gold.

After World War II, the United States, having made a fortune during the war, took advantage of the severe war wounds suffered by Western European countries and others. It trampled on these countries, dumping American goods, leading to a severe dollar shortage in those countries. However, the dream of US monopoly capitalists to dominate the capitalist world has finally been shattered by the new development of the law of unbalanced capitalist development. In recent years, the economic strength of Western European countries has recovered somewhat, and their economic power relative to the United States has been continuously increasing. American goods are already facing fierce competition from Western European goods in the capitalist world market. Since 1957, US commodity exports have been declining. In the first five months of this year, they decreased by 6% compared to the same period last year. Moreover, Western European goods are increasingly penetrating the US domestic market. As a result, the United States experienced a $300 million deficit in its trade in goods and services in the first quarter of this year, while the United States had consistently maintained a trade surplus in goods for many years.

Because US commodity exports are difficult, and other capitalist countries have high tariff barriers, the United States is intensifying capital exports, entering these barriers to establish enterprises and promote sales. According to statistics from the US Department of Commerce, US private direct foreign investment reached $240 million in the first quarter of this year, an increase of $90 million compared to the same period last year. However, Western European countries such as West Germany, which has become wealthy, and Britain, an old rentier country, are also engaging in fierce competition with the United States in terms of foreign investment. In the past year, although US private capital exports to Western Europe and other regions have continued to grow, capital exports to some regions such as Latin America have declined. Moreover, the total amount of US private capital exports last year was less than in 1956 and 1957.

The large increase in the US international balance of payments deficit is also particularly due to its intensified construction of atomic rocket bases overseas, maintaining a large overseas military presence, and continuing to provide its allies in the military bloc it controls with substantial amounts of various types of military "aid." According to incomplete statistics, this dollar expenditure amounted to more than $8 billion last year. This was originally an important component of the US policy of establishing a "position of strength," but from an economic standpoint, it has precisely weakened the United States itself. Some members of the US ruling clique already believe that the United States will be unable to sustain this level of "aid" and that it should be greatly reduced or even eliminated for Western European countries. However, another faction within the US ruling clique hesitates, arguing that if they do so, how can the United States continue to spur Western European countries to expand their armaments, prepare for war, and accept US troops?

The economic consequences of the US "position of strength" policy extend far beyond this. Under the large-scale nuclear arms race in the United States, the US budget deficit for the fiscal year 1959, which ended at the end of last month, reached $12.5 billion. Eisenhower signed a bill on June 30, raising the national debt limit to $295 billion. The US financial situation is so serious that Eisenhower, at a press conference on July 1, and the Nixon-led anti-inflation committee also loudly called for "stopping" inflation. It is very clear that if US inflation continues, other Western countries will lose even more confidence in the dollar and will be even more eager to convert their dollar reserves into gold.

Rumors of dollar devaluation are frequently heard in Western European countries. The US government continues to vigorously resist the pressure to devalue the dollar. However, the dollar is already devaluing in the Western European market. American newspapers acknowledge that "the dollar no longer holds an unquestionable leading position among the world's currencies." The July 6th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" magazine stated: "Since the first half of this year, the position of the dollar has been weak against almost every major European currency, even against the long-weak member of the European currency family, the French franc."

The US ruling clique has always relied on its countless riches, jingling dollars in hand, to make its "allies" kowtow and bow to it. Now, the massive outflow of American gold and the precarious value of the dollar provide a stark backdrop to the increasing difficulty the United States faces in issuing orders in the West and the growing disunity of the Western camp.

    美国在西方世界霸权衰退的一个标志
    美国黄金滚滚外流
    国库储备已减少到二十年来最低点
    本报讯　记者万光报道：“美国黄金继续大量外流”——这是经常出现在美国和西欧报刊的标题。美国人正在焦虑不安地议论着，西欧人则在窃窃自喜地注视着。
    美国国库中的黄金储备现在已经锐减到二十年来的最低点。在去年一年和今年上半年里，美国黄金储备一共减少了三十一亿多美元。到7月1日，已下跌到一百九十七亿美元，即比美国黄金储备战后最高纪录减少了约20％（四十六亿美元）。
    美国丧失的黄金，绝大部分是流往英国和西德等西欧国家的。美国曾经一度占有资本主义世界黄金总储备量的70％，而目前已下降到50％。这是资本主义国家不平衡发展加剧、美国在西方世界霸权衰退的一个显著标志。
    目前，外国政府、银行和私人手中握有一百五十多亿美元储备。如果这些美元储备一齐向美国国库兑换黄金，美国能够留下的储备更不足美元和美国银行保证金法定的黄金储备量。
    美国在黄金储备上的地位变得这样软弱，原因是多方面的。美国国际支付上的逆差去年来有很大增长。获得美元的其他国家鉴于美国经济危机和美元不牢靠，纷纷把美元兑换成黄金。
    第二次世界大战结束后，在战争中发了横财的美国，乘西欧等地区国家受战争严重创伤之际，曾经把这些国家踏在脚下，向这些国家倾销美国商品，使得这些国家大闹美元荒。但是，美国垄断资本家独霸资本主义世界的迷梦，终于被资本主义不平衡发展规律的新发展所打破。近几年来，西欧国家经济力量有所恢复，它们在经济上同美国的力量对比不断在增强。美国商品已经在资本主义世界市场上受到西欧国家的商品的激烈竞争。从1957年以来，美国的商品出口一直在下降。今年头五个月又比去年同期下降了6％。而且，西欧国家的商品也在越来越多地渗入美国国内市场。结果使美国在今年第一季度商品和劳务贸易上出现了三亿美元的逆差，而美国许多年来一贯在商品贸易上是保持出超的。
    由于美国商品出口不易，其他资本主义国家的关税壁垒重重，美国正在加紧资本输出；打进这些壁垒内部来开设企业，推销商品。据美国
  商务部统计，今年第一季度美国私人对外直接投资达二亿四千万美元，比去年同期增加了九千万美元。但是羽毛丰满起来的西德、老牌食利国英国等西欧国家同美国在对外投资方面也正在展开激烈的竞争。去年来，美国虽然对西欧等地区的私人资本输出在继续增长，但是对拉丁美
  洲等一些地区的资本输出已在下降。而且，美国私人资本输出在去年的总额已比不上1956年和1957年。
    美国国际支付逆差大量增长，还特别由于它加紧在海外建筑原子火箭基地，维持庞大的海外驻军，继续给予它控制的军事集团里的盟国以大量的各种军事“援助”。据不完全统计，这笔美元开支去年达八十多亿美元。这原是美国建立“实力地位”政策的一个重要组成部分，然而仅仅从经济上看，它却恰恰削弱美国自己。美国统治集团有一部分人士已经认为长此“援助”下去美国将吃不住，应该大大削减以至取消美国对西欧国家的“援助”。但是，美国统治集团里另一部分人士却犹豫地争论道，要是这样做的话，美国又怎能使西欧国家继续在美国鞭策下扩军备战和接受美国驻军呢。
    美国“实力地位”政策的经济后果还远不止于此。在美国进行大规模核军备竞赛下，上月底结束的1959财政年度的美国预算赤字高达一百二十五亿美元。艾森豪威尔6月30日已签署法案，把国债限额提高到二千九百五十亿美元。美国财政情况如此严重以至艾森豪威尔7月1日在记者招待会上以及尼克松领导的反通货膨胀委员会也都大声疾呼要“制止”通货膨胀。事情很清楚，美国通货膨胀继续下去，其他西方国家便更加要对美元丧失信心，更加要把他们的美元储备抢兑成黄金。
    在西欧国家里已经可以频频听到美元贬值的传闻。美国政府继续在竭力抗拒要美元贬值的压力。然而美元在西欧市场上实际上已经在贬值。美国报刊承认，“美元已不再居于世界货币中无可怀疑的领导地位了”。7月6日一期的“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志说：“自从今年上半年以来，美元的地位对欧洲差不多每一种主要货币而言都是软弱的，甚至对欧洲货币家庭中长期孱弱的成员法国法郎而言也如此。”
    美国统治集团向来是自恃它金钱无数，手里叮当敲着美元，来使得它的“盟国”向它磕头作揖的。现在，美国黄金的大量外流，美元价值的摇摇欲坠，也正是给美国目前在西方发号施令日益不易、西方阵营日益走向四分五裂，提供了一个鲜明的背景。
