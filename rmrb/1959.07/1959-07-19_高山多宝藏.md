    High Mountains Abound in Treasures
    Shí Gōng
    Recently, our country's mountaineering team ascended Mount Muztagh Ata, which is 7,546 meters above sea level, a rarity in foreign countries. Europe, the Americas, and Africa do not have mountains this high; however, there are many mountains in our country that are even higher. Not far west of Mount Muztagh Ata is Mount Kongur Tagh, which is 1,065 meters higher. Mount Everest is even higher. Most of the world's mountains exceeding 8,000 meters are within our borders, and there are even more mountains around 6,000-7,000 meters or 5,000 meters. The average height of the peaks of the Himalayas is over 6,000 meters. The Tianshan, Kunlun, Qilian, Nyainqêntanglha, Karakoram Mountains, and the Hengduan Mountains in western Yunnan and Sichuan also have many peaks over 5,000 meters above sea level.
    Why does our country have so many high mountains? Because our country was mostly ocean in Earth's history. Strangely enough, today's high mountains are, and must have been, the seas of the past. These seas often took the form of narrow, elongated troughs, with the seabed constantly sinking. Consequently, the silt carried by the flowing water could never fill them up, and they accumulated to a great thickness. The rocks formed from these deposits can be over 10,000 meters thick.
    Why does the seabed sink? This is because the Earth's crust is subjected to pressure. This pressure is generated by the movement of matter within the Earth and disappears after a certain period. Once the pressure disappears, the depressed part of the crust rises, and the deposits accumulated within it also rise, forming high mountains. The more severe the subsidence and the thicker the deposits in the sea, the higher the mountains that are formed. In Earth's history, our country's mountains were mostly formed by seas that underwent long-term subsidence and thick deposits. Many of these mountains were formed relatively recently in Earth's development. Among them, the Himalayas are the youngest and are still rising. The ages of the Tianshan, Kunlun, and Qilian Mountains are only over 100 million years, and their heights have not been reduced too much by wind, water, ice, snow, and other forms of erosion. Mount Tai was created hundreds of millions of years ago, and after a long period of destruction, it is only 1,500 meters above sea level today.
    In the past, high mountain areas were often considered to have thin soil, thick rock, barren land, and a cold climate, making them of little use. Indeed, high mountains pose inconveniences for the development of agriculture and transportation, but things always have another side. High mountains are formed by orogenic movements, and these movements generate a large amount of magmatic activity. When this magma cools, it forms the backbone of the mountains and creates abundant mineral resources, especially metallic minerals. We have already preliminarily determined that the Qilian, Qinling, and Nanling Mountains are all treasure troves rich in mineral deposits. These mountains are relatively lower high mountains, and we still understand very little about the many more and higher mountains. Therefore, mountaineering is not only a sports activity but will also make a significant contribution to science and production. (Attached picture)

    高山多宝藏
    石工
    最近我国登山队登上的慕士塔格山，拔海七千五百四十六米，在国外是少见的。欧洲、美洲和非洲都没有这么高的山，然而比它更高的山在我国还很多。在慕士塔格山西边不远有一座奥斯腾峰便比它高出一千零六十五米，珠穆朗玛峰就更高了。世界上超过八千米的高山大部在我国境内，至于六、七千米或五千米左右的高山就更多了。喜马拉雅山诸峰的平均高度就在六千米以上，天山、昆仑山、祁连山、念青唐古拉山、喀喇昆仑山以及云南、四川西部的横断山脉中，都有许多拔海五千米以上的高峰。
    为什么我国有这么多高山呢？因为我国在地球历史上多海。说也奇怪，今日的高山正是而且必定是昔日的海，这种海常呈狭长的槽形，海底不断下沉，因而流水搬来的泥沙总是填不满它，堆积得很厚。由这些堆积物变成的岩石，竟可以厚达万米以上。
    海底为什么会下沉呢？这因为那里的地壳受到挤压。这种压力是由于地球内部物质的运动产生的，经过一定时期便会消失。压力一旦消失，地壳下凹部分就会回升，聚集在其中的堆积物也随着隆起形成了高山。沉降得愈厉害、堆积物愈厚的海，形成的高山也就愈高。我国这些高山在地球历史上大都是经过长期沉降、堆积物很厚的海所形成，而且许多高山都是地球发展到距今较近的时期才形成的。其中喜马拉雅山最为年轻，一直到现在还在继续上升，天山、昆仑山、祁连山等的年龄，只不过一万万多年，还没有因为受到风、水、冰、雪等的侵蚀而降低太多的高度；泰山是在几万万年前造成的，经过较长时期的破坏，到今天拔海只有一千五百米了。
    从前高山区常被人们认为土薄石厚、地瘠天寒，没有多大用处。是的，高山对于发展农业、交通等确有不便，但事情总是有它另外的一面，高山是造山运动形成的，而造山运动进行时会产生大量岩浆活动，这些岩浆冷却后构成大山的脊骨，同时造成了丰富的矿产特别是金属矿。目前我们已初步探明祁连山、秦岭、南岭等高山都是矿藏丰富的宝库。这些山都是比较低一点的高山，更多更高的大山我们还了解得很少。因此登山运动不仅是一项体育活动，而且对科学与生产也将作出重大贡献。（附图片）
