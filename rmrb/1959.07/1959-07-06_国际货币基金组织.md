	International Monetary Fund
	The "International Monetary Fund" was initiated at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference in July 1944 and officially established in December 1945. It currently has sixty-seven member states. The Board of Governors (the highest authority) meets once a year. The voting rights within this organization are directly proportional to the fund quotas of the member states. The United States, through this, holds one-third of the total votes, firmly controlling the organization and making it serve its aggressive policies.
	The "International Monetary Fund's" fund is composed of gold and member states' currencies, totaling US$9,016 million (as of November 30, 1957), shared by member states according to agreed quotas.
	The purpose of the "International Monetary Fund" is to "facilitate the balanced growth of international trade" and "promote the stability of foreign exchange." However, in reality, the United States uses it to force other countries to abolish foreign exchange controls and lift population restrictions in order to carry out political control and economic plunder of underdeveloped countries. The "economic stabilization plans" recently accepted by Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia are clear evidence of this.
	Every year, this organization also sends delegations and "experts" to visit various member states under the guise of "technical assistance," and uses the provision in the agreement that "member states have an obligation to provide information" to collect various financial, monetary, trade, and foreign exchange information on a large scale, interfering in the economic policies of general member states, especially those countries that receive loans from the organization. In 1954, the United States attempted to use the "International Monetary Fund" to collect economic intelligence from Czechoslovakia (then the only socialist country participating in the organization), which was rejected by the Czechoslovak government. The organization then brutally expelled Czechoslovakia from membership on December 31, 1954. (Shi)

    国际货币基金组织
    “国际货币基金组织”是1944年7月在联合国货币金融会议上发起，于1945年12月正式成立的。现有六十七个会员国。每年召开一次董事会（最高权力机构）。这个组织内的表决权与会员国基金分摊额成正比例。美国通过它占有全部表决票数的三分之一，牢牢地控制了这个组织，并使之为它的侵略政策服务。
    “国际货币基金组织”的基金是由黄金和会员国货币组成的，总额合九十亿一千六百万美元（截至1957年11月30日止），由会员国根据议定的份额分摊。
    “国际货币基金组织”的宗旨是：“便利国际贸易之平衡发展”及“促进外汇之稳定”。但实际上，美国通过它强使其他国家废除外汇管制、取消人口限制，以便对不发达国家进行政治控制和经济掠夺。最近阿根廷、智利和玻利维亚接受的“稳定经济计划”就是明证。
    这个组织每年还以“技术援助”名义派代表团和“专家”访问各会员国，利用协定中关于“会员国有义务供给情报”的规定，大规模搜集各种财政、金融、贸易和外汇的情报，干预一般会员国特别是得到这个组织贷款的国家的经济政策。1954年美国就企图利用“国际货币基金组织”搜集捷克斯洛伐克（当时是参加这个组织的唯一的社会主义国家）的经济情报，遭到了捷克斯洛伐克政府的拒绝。而这个组织竟在1954年12月31日粗暴地开除捷克斯洛伐克会籍。　（施）
