The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) closed on June 29th. The plenary session discussed the work of the Party and Soviet organizations, and the National Economic Councils in implementing the resolutions of the 21st CPSU Congress on accelerating technological progress in industry and construction.

Fifty-two people participated in the discussion of this extremely important issue – members of the Party Central Committee, Party, Soviet, economic institution, trade union, and Communist Youth League workers invited to the plenary session, and leaders of enterprises and construction sites, and workers – advanced producers. The plenary session unanimously adopted a resolution on the discussed issues and issued an inspiring appeal to workers, collective farm members, Soviet intellectuals, and all Soviet working people, calling on them to more broadly launch a nationwide socialist competition to strive for the early completion of the Seven-Year Plan and technological progress.

Comrade N.S. Khrushchev spoke at the CPSU Central Committee Plenary Session. In his speech, he raised the fundamental issues of communist construction. He emphasized that the plenary session was conducted at a high level, in a highly positive and Bolshevik realistic spirit, which aroused people's pride and joy. Khrushchev said, "All the speeches were very brilliant, and all the speeches were for one purpose - to strive to ensure the successful implementation of the resolutions of the 21st CPSU Congress and to show the world what the working class and working people who have seized power can do."

The detailed materials of the plenary session published during the Central Committee meeting and the resolutions adopted by the plenary session have been unanimously endorsed and warmly supported by the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union. In these days, various meetings have been held in factories, construction sites, collective farms and state farms, and scientific institutions. At the meetings, the Soviet people said that the resolutions of the plenary session fully conform to the vital interests of all the people of our multinational socialist motherland and have great significance for the great cause of communist construction. The Leninist national policy is clearly demonstrated in the Seven-Year Plan. This policy guarantees broad possibilities for the comprehensive development of the economy and culture of all nationalities. The work of the CPSU Central Committee Plenary Session and the enthusiastic response of the various republics to the Central Committee's documents brilliantly demonstrate the unbreakable brotherly friendship of the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union, their close unity around the Communist Party, and their firm determination to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

Countless reactions from socialist countries such as the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Bulgaria, and Hungary convincingly prove that the resolutions of the CPSU Central Committee's June Plenary Session aimed at completing the Seven-Year Plan have been unanimously approved by the entire powerful socialist camp, and the realization of these resolutions will be a great victory for the invincible Marxism-Leninism doctrine.

The CPSU Central Committee Plenary Session noted with satisfaction that the Party organizations have guided the enthusiasm of the broad masses of working people to struggle for the implementation of the resolutions of the 21st Party Congress and the completion of the Seven-Year Plan. The achievements made by the Soviet people in the first few months of the Seven-Year Plan clearly prove this: industry, construction, and transportation departments have completed the five-month plan ahead of schedule, spring sowing has been successfully completed, and the procurement of livestock products has increased.

In the period since the 20th CPSU Congress, our country has taken another big step forward in the development and technological improvement of various sectors of the national economy. The reorganization of industrial and construction management is indeed a revolutionary measure. Eliminating departmental barriers, bringing leadership closer to enterprises and construction sites, the active participation of local Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations in economic management, and the growing initiative of the working people have all made it possible to better tap potential, increase the speed of industrial production and industrial construction, and create conditions for more rapid application of scientific and technological achievements and further development of specialization and collaboration.

Since the 20th CPSU Congress, more than 5,000 new machines, machinery, equipment, and instruments for mass production have been established and mastered, advanced technological processes have been formulated and applied on a large scale, the level of mechanization, especially the mechanization of heavy work, has been greatly improved, and many production processes have been automated. The Soviet Union's brilliant achievements in the peaceful use of atomic energy, jet aircraft, the launch of the first artificial Earth satellites and the first cosmic rockets in human history are well known to all.

However, the Leninist Communist Party should not be satisfied with the achievements already made. Their will, energy, and strength are surging forward, focusing on accelerating the pace of technological progress, thereby ensuring the early completion of the Seven-Year Plan. Realizing these resolutions is equivalent to winning the main thing in the peaceful economic competition with capitalism - time. As Comrade Khrushchev vividly put it, the whole problem now lies in accelerating our pace, because this is an accelerated pace towards communism.

We have every possibility to further accelerate our victorious pace. Therefore, the Party and the people are full of determination to move forward faster. The work of the plenary session was filled with the Leninist and Bolshevik spirit: an uncompromising attitude towards shortcomings, backward phenomena, conservatism, bureaucracy, violations of Party discipline, state law, and labor discipline, and all phenomena that hinder our progress towards communism.

The resolution of the CPSU Central Committee Plenary Session pointed out: "In our country, there are all the necessary conditions to successfully complete the planned programs for further improving production technology. The Central Committee believes that the main thing now is to improve organizational work and strengthen the leadership of Party and economic institutions in the cause of adopting advanced technology to adapt to new tasks. Party, Soviet, economic institution, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations should focus their attention on eliminating the serious shortcomings that exist in the work of technological improvement in various sectors of the national economy, which have curbed the pace of technological progress. Such phenomena can no longer be tolerated, such as the fact that many National Economic Councils, enterprises, and scientific research organizations have not completed the tasks stipulated in the formulation and adoption of advanced technology, the mastering of the production of new products, and the modernization of outdated equipment, thereby causing serious losses to the interests of the national economy."

The Central Committee Plenary Session and the resolutions it adopted severely criticized the incorrect practices of wasting a lot of time unnecessarily in the manufacture of new machines, the formulation of more perfect technological procedures, the formulation of reasonable patterns of building equipment, and the manufacture of effective equipment and their application to production and construction. By the time they are put into production, some of them are outdated. Many enterprises have adopted expensive machines, automated production lines, and machinery, but the adoption of these machines and machinery has not produced significant economic results.

At the same time, the adoption of new technology should not only increase the production of products, but must also improve labor productivity, reduce workers' labor, improve product quality, and reduce product costs.

The CPSU Central Committee Plenary Session pointed out that the shortcomings in the adoption of new, highly productive, and more economical technologies are largely due to the conservatism of some economic and engineering technical personnel, their habit of old production methods and labor tools, and their unwillingness to overcome the difficulties arising from the adoption of new technology and the lack of a national attitude towards the technical perfection of production. The task now is to accelerate the process of technological progress in various sectors of the national economy, resolutely oppose conservatism, improve the work plan for the adoption of new technology, increase the responsibility of the leaders of enterprises and construction sites, scientific institutions, and design institutions for this matter, and give full play to the initiative of workers, engineering technical personnel, and scientists. The resolution of the CPSU Central Committee Plenary Session pointed out: "The technological perfection of production, which is carried out to improve labor productivity, reduce worker labor, rapidly increase industrial production, improve its quality, reduce its cost, reduce construction costs, and accelerate construction, should be the main direction in the work of the National Economic Councils."

The extremely important, nationwide task of formulating and adopting new technology is an organic part of the national economic plan.

The experience of advanced enterprises convincingly proves that our industry has enormous potential to expand product production in a shorter time and with less capital than new enterprises. Reconstructing, expanding, technically re-equipping existing enterprises, and modernizing their equipment open up such possibilities. The CPSU Central Committee Plenary Session approved the initiative shown in this regard by the working people, Party organizations, and economic institutions of Vladimir Oblast and Sverdlovsk Oblast, Moscow City, Moscow Oblast, Leningrad Oblast, Gorky Oblast, Zaporozhye Oblast, Dnepropetrovsk Oblast, and other oblasts, as well as Belarus. Considering that the modernization of equipment can rapidly increase product and improve labor productivity with less consumption of material capital, the plenary session emphasized that it is necessary to do everything possible to accelerate this work in various enterprises, and determined along what main lines this work should develop in major industrial sectors.

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union regards the comprehensive mechanization and automation of production as the basic means of technological progress, which not only has economic significance, but also has significant social significance. They are in line with the vital interests of our working people.

The CPSU Central Committee Plenary Session pointed out that although enormous work has been carried out in the mechanization and automation of production, there are still significant shortcomings in this important aspect. In most production sectors, the problem of comprehensive mechanization of many types of work, especially the mechanization of auxiliary work, in which nearly half of all workers are employed, has not been solved. Mechanization in the construction industry and loading and unloading work, as well as in agricultural production, is still very insufficient.

The plenary session resolution pointed out the urgent and top-priority work in the comprehensive mechanization of heavy production processes in many industrial sectors. In terms of automation, the main attention should be focused on the practical solution of the following tasks: transitioning from the automation of individual production processes to the establishment of fully automated technological procedures, workshops, and enterprises, first in those sectors where automation can ensure the greatest economic results.

The measures pointed out by the CPSU Central Committee Plenary Session for the further development of specialization and collaboration in the national economy are of important principled significance for the victorious completion of the Seven-Year Plan. The plenary session instructed the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the various republics, the Party Committees of the border regions, the Party Committees of the states, the Party Committees of the cities, the Party Committees of the districts, and the primary Party organizations to resolutely eliminate departmentalism, strengthen the supervision of the utilization of investment and materials in important projects under construction, and severely punish those leaders who violate state discipline, regardless of their position. The implementation of this instruction of the plenary session is of decisive significance for the entire cause of communist construction. Comrade N.S. Khrushchev emphasized in his speech: "It is necessary to resolutely fight against the phenomenon of violating Party and state discipline, no matter what form it takes. It is necessary to educate cadres to strictly abide by the interests of the Party and the state without exception. Comrades, without doing this, we cannot move forward smoothly."

The Party has put very important tasks before Soviet science. Scientists and production personnel share the task of arming the national economy with new theoretical research, conclusions, suggestions, and inventions, because this can accelerate the adoption of the latest scientific and technological achievements in various sectors of the national economy and promote the victorious completion of the Seven-Year Plan.

The plenary session emphasized the increasing role and responsibility of Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations in the manufacture and adoption of new technology. While leading the struggle for technological progress, Party organizations should specifically and purposefully solve the problem of comprehensive mechanization and automation of production processes, support and resolutely promote all advanced and progressive things in production, and resolutely fight against conservative phenomena and attitudes that ignore new technology and the experience of innovators. The plenary session resolution said that Party organizations must strive to ensure that those who are trained, familiar with technology and economics, have high organizational skills, and can ensure the technological progress of the national economy lead the various sectors of economic construction. It is necessary to increase the sense of responsibility of leading cadres in industry and construction for the cause they are undertaking, educate them to strictly abide by state discipline, and make them have strict requirements and an attitude of intolerance towards mistakes. It is necessary to resolutely replace those leading personnel who are stagnant, do not care about technological progress, and replace vivid organizational work with general appeals. It is necessary to promote young experts more boldly, and in this regard, we must follow Lenin's instructions on the combination of old and young cadres.

The CPSU Central Committee Plenary Session called on the people to launch a nationwide socialist competition more widely for the early completion of the Seven-Year Plan and for technological progress. In the letter to workers, collective farmers, Soviet intellectuals, and all Soviet working people, it said:

"Our Party, as in the past, is doing this to improve the people's lives, increase the people's material and spiritual wealth, and further strengthen the power of the socialist motherland.

Our Party is doing this to reduce the labor of the Soviet people and make the labor of the Soviet people more productive.

Our Party is doing this to better meet the growing material and cultural needs of the working people in urban and rural areas, to ensure that the Soviet people have abundant food, clothing, shoes, and other consumer goods. It is also doing this to more rapidly eliminate the shortage of housing and ensure that every Soviet family has a fully equipped residence. It is doing this to more rapidly achieve the shortest workday and the shortest workweek in the world, so that the Soviet people have more leisure time to study and rest, so that they all become educated and cultured people."

Our people are now and will continue to build the magnificent edifice of communism with heroic labor. The Soviet people, closely united around the long-tested leader, the organizer of all our victories - the Leninist Party, are confidently advancing along the road pointed out by the historical resolutions of the 21st Party Congress, towards the victory of communism.

    加速我们向共产主义迈进的步伐
    苏联“真理报”七月三日社论
    苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议已于6月29日闭幕。全会讨论了党和苏维埃组织，以及国民经济委员会在执行苏共第二十一次代表大会关于加速工业和建筑业中的技术进步的决议方面的工作问题。
    参加讨论这个极其重要的问题的有五十二人——党中央委员会委员、应邀参加全体会议的党、苏维埃、经济机构、工会和共青团工作者，企业和建筑工地的领导人，工人——先进生产者。全会就讨论的问题一致通过决议，向工人、集体农庄庄员、苏联知识分子、全体苏联劳动人民发出了令人鼓舞的号召，号召他们更加广泛地开展争取提前完成七年计划和技术进步的全民性社会主义竞赛。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志在苏共中央全会上讲了话，他在讲话中提出了共产主义建设的根本问题，他强调指出，全体会议是在高度水平，在高度积极性和布尔什维克的实事求是的气氛中进行的。而这引起了人们的自豪感和欢欣鼓舞的心情。赫鲁晓夫说，“所有的发言都是非常精彩的，所有的发言都是为了一个目的——竭力保证成功地执行苏共第二十一次代表大会的决议，并向全世界表明，掌握了政权的工人阶级、劳动人民能做出什么来。”
    中央全会开会期间详细发表的全会材料和全会所通过的决议受到苏联各族人民一致拥护和热烈支持。这些日子各企业、建筑工地、集体农庄和国营农场、科学机关都纷纷举行各种会议；苏联人民在会上都说，全会决议完全符合我们多民族社会主义祖国全体人民的切身利益，对共产主义建设的伟大事业有着巨大的意义。在七年计划中，明显地表现了列宁主义的民族政策，这个政策保证有广泛的可能性来全面发展各族人民的经济和文化。苏共中央全会的工作、各加盟共和国对中央全会的文件的热烈反应，光辉地显示了苏联各族人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊、他们在共产党周围的紧密团结和他们要提前完成七年计划的坚定决心。
    来自中华人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、波兰、保加利亚和匈牙利等社会主义国家的无数反应，令人信服地证明，苏共中央六月全会旨在完成七年计划的决议受到整个强大的社会主义阵营一致的赞同，这些决议的实现将是所向无敌的马克思列宁主义学说的伟大胜利。
    苏共中央全会满意地指出，党组织引导了广大劳动人民群众的积极性为实现第二十一次党代表大会的决议、为完成七年计划而斗争。苏联人民在七年计划头几个月中取得的成就清楚地证明了这一点：工业、建筑业和运输部门提前完成了五个月的计划，春播已经胜利完成，畜牧业产品采购量已经增长。
    在第二十次党代表大会以来的这段时期，我国在国民经济各部门的发展和技术上完善方面又向前迈了一大步。工业和建筑业管理的改组的确是一个革命的措施。消除本位主义障碍，领导接近企业和建筑工地，地方党、工会、共青团组织积极参加经济管理，劳动人民的日益增长的主动性，这一切都使得有可能更好地发挥潜力，提高工业生产和工业建设速度，为更迅速地运用科学技术成就，进一步发展专业化和协作创造了条件。
    自苏共第二十次代表大会以来，建立和掌握大批生产的新机器、机械、设备和仪器有五千多种，制定和大规模地运用了先进工艺过程，机械化水平特别是繁重工作的机械化水平大大提高了，许多生产过程实现了自动化。苏联在和平利用原子能、喷气飞机、发射人类历史上头几个人造地球卫星和第一支宇宙火箭方面的辉煌成就是人人皆知的。
    但是，列宁主义的共产党人不应满足于已取得的成就。他们的意志、精力和力量蓬勃向前，集中于加速技术进步的速度，从而保证提前完成七年计划。实现这些决议就等于在同资本主义进行的和平经济竞赛中赢得了主要的东西——时间。像赫鲁晓夫同志生动比喻的那样，全部问题现在就在于加速我们前进的步伐，因为这是向共产主义前进的加速的步伐。
    我们有一切可能性进一步加速自己胜利的步伐。因此，党和人民充满决心更快地向前迈进。全会的工作充满了列宁主义的、布尔什维克的精神：对缺点、对落后现象、对因循守旧现象、对官僚主义、对破坏党纪国法和劳动纪律的现象、对一切阻碍我们向共产主义前进的现象采取不调和的态度。
    苏共中央全会的决议指出：“在我们国家，有一切必要的条件来胜利地完成所拟定的进一步提高生产技术水平的计划。中央全会认为，现在主要的是，提高组织工作，加强党和经济机构对采用先进技术以适应新任务这一事业的领导。党、苏维埃、经济机构、工会和共青团组织应当集中注意去消除在使国民经济各部门技术完善的工作方面所存在的严重缺点，这些缺点遏止了技术进步的速度。再不能容忍这样的现象，即很多国家经济委员会、企业和科学研究组织没有完成在制定和采用先进技术、掌握新产品的生产和使过时设备现代化方面所规定的任务，从而对国民经济的利益造成严重的损失。”
    中央全会和它所通过的决议严厉批评了这种不正确的做法：在制造新机器、制定更完善的工艺规程、制定合理的建筑设备图案和制造有效的器材并把它们用于生产和建筑中等方面无端地浪费了很多时间，而到投入生产的时候，其中有一些便过时了。许多企业采用了昂贵的机器、自动作业线和机械，而这些机器和机械的采用没有产生显著的经济效果。
    同时，采用新技术不仅应当增加产品的生产，而且必须提高劳动生产率和减轻工人的劳动、提高产品的质量和降低产品的成本。
    苏共中央全会指出，在采用新的、生产效能高的、更经济的技术方面的缺点在很大程度上是由于下列原因而产生的：部分经济人员和工程技术人员的保守主义，习惯于老的生产方式和劳动工具，不想克服由于采用新技术、由于对生产的技术完善问题缺乏国家态度而产生的困难。现在的任务在于：在国民经济各部门加速技术进步的过程、坚决反对保守主义、改善采用新技术方面的工作计划、提高企业和建筑工地、科学机构和设计机构的领导人对这件事所负的责任、全力发挥工人、工程技术人员和科学家的主动性。苏共中央全会决议指出：“为了提高劳动生产率和减轻工人劳动、迅速提高工业生产、提高其质量和降低其成本、减低建筑造价和加速建设而进行的生产技术完善应当是国民经济委员会工作中的主要方向。”
    在制定和采用新技术方面的极其重要的、具有全国性意义的任务是国民经济计划的有机的组成部分。
    先进企业的经验令人信服地证明，我们的工业有巨大可能性，比新建企业用更短时间和更少资金来扩大产品生产。改建、扩建、在技术上重新装备现有企业、使它们的设备现代化等开辟了这样的可能性。苏共中央全会赞同符拉季米尔州和斯维德洛夫州、莫斯科市、莫斯科州、列宁格勒州、高尔基州、萨波罗什州、第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克州和其他一些州以及白俄罗斯等地的劳动人民、党组织和经济机构在这方面所表现的主动性。考虑到设备的现代化可以在少消耗物质资金的情况下迅速增加产品和提高劳动生产率，全会强调必须尽力加速在各企业进行这项工作，并确定了这项工作在重大工业部门应当沿着怎样的主要路线发展。
    苏联共产党把生产的全盘机械化和自动化看作是技术进步的基本手段，生产的全盘机械化和自动化不仅具有经济意义，而且也具有重大的社会意义，它们是符合我国劳动人民的切身利益的。
    苏共中央全会指出，虽然在生产机械化和自动化方面进行了巨大的工作，但是在这一个重要的方面还存在着重大的缺点。在大多数生产部门实际上还没有解决许多工种的全盘机械化问题，特别是辅助工种的机械化问题，在这些工种里工作的将近有全体工人的一半。在建筑业和装卸工作中，以及农业生产中机械化做得还很不够。
    全会决议指出了在使许多工业部门中繁重生产过程全盘机械化方面的迫切的头等重要的工作。在自动化方面，主要注意力应该集中在实际解决下列任务：由个别生产工序的自动化过渡到建立完全自动化的工艺规程、车间和企业，首先是在自动化可以保证最大经济效果的那些部门这样做。
    苏共中央全会指出的进一步发展国民经济专业化和协作的措施对胜利完成七年计划具有重要的原则性的意义。全会责成各加盟共和国共产党中央委员会、边疆区党委会、州党委会、市党委会、区党委会和党的基层组织坚决杜绝本位主义，加强对投资和物资在重要的、开工的项目中利用情况的监督，严厉惩办那些破坏国家纪律的领导者，不管他们的职位如何。执行全会的这项指示对整个共产主义建设事业具有决定性意义。尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志在讲话中强调指出：“必需同破坏党和国家纪律的现象作坚决斗争，不管它以何种形式出现。必须教育干部，使他们一无例外地严格遵守党和国家的利益。同志们，不做到这一点，我们就不能顺利地前进”。
    党在苏联科学面前提出了十分重大的任务。科学家和生产工作人员共同担负的任务是用新的理论研究、结论、建议和发明武装国民经济，因为这可以加速国民经济各部门采用最新科学技术成就，促进七年计划的胜利完成。
    全会着重指出了党、工会和共青团组织在制造和采用新技术方面的日益增长的作用和责任。党组织在领导争取技术进步的同时，应该具体地和有目的地解决生产过程全盘机械化和自动化问题，支持和在生产中坚决推广一切先进的和进步的事物，坚决同守旧现象、忽视新技术和革新者的经验的态度进行斗争。全会决议中说，党组织必需努力做到，让那些有训练的、熟悉技术和经济、具有高度组织能力、能够保证国民经济技术进步的人员去领导经济建设各部门。必需提高工业和建筑业领导干部对他们所担负的事业的责任感，教育他们严格遵守国家纪律，使他们具有严格的要求和对错误不妥协的态度。必需坚决撤换那些停滞不前、对技术进步不关心、以一般的号召代替生动的组织工作的领导人员。必需更大胆地提拔年青的专家，在这方面要遵循列宁关于老干部和青年干部相结合的指示。
    苏共中央全会号召人民为提前完成七年计划、为技术进步更广泛地展开全民性的社会主义竞赛，在告工人、集体农民、苏联知识分子、苏联全体劳动人民书中说：
    “我们党像以往一样，这样做是为了改善人民生活，增加人民的物质财富和精神财富，为了进一步加强社会主义祖国的威力。
    我们党这样做，是为了减轻苏联人的劳动，使苏联人的劳动更有生产效果。
    我们党这样做，是为了更好地满足城乡劳动人民日益增长的物质和文化需求，保证苏联人民有丰裕的食品、服装、鞋靴和其他消费品，这样做还为的是更迅速地消除住房的不足和保证每一个苏联家庭都有一套设备完善的住宅，这样做是为了更迅速地达到世界上最短的工作日和最短的工作周，使苏联人有更多的余暇来学习和休息，使他们都成为受过教育和有文化的人。”
    我国人民现在正在并将继续用英勇的劳动建筑起共产主义的宏伟大厦。苏联人民紧密团结在久经考验的领袖、我们一切胜利的组织者——列宁主义的党的周围，满怀信心地沿着第二十一次党代表大会的历史性决议所指明的道路，向着共产主义的胜利前进。
