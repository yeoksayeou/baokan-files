Changsha, July 1st (From our newspaper) – The You County Party Committee of Hunan Province, under the guiding ideology of “bumper harvests every season, abundant harvests of all grains,” not only seized early rice production firmly, but also grasped intermediate and late rice production closely, according to the agricultural season. Not only did they focus on rice production, but also on sweet potatoes and other coarse grains.

After the County Party Committee put forward the slogan of launching a thousand-catty bumper harvest campaign, starting with early rice, they firmly grasped early rice production, focusing on implementing the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture since last winter. After the early rice was transplanted, they seized the key word "management," overcoming the hurdles of reviving, tillering, jointing, and heading. Currently, the early rice is generally flowering and filling, and a bumper harvest is in sight.

When the early rice was generally jointing and heading, the county's more than 150,000 mu of intermediate and single-season late rice were growing well. The County Party Committee timely proposed the slogan of "one season competing with two seasons, a single season surpassing double-cropping rice," and summarized the experience of firmly grasping the key word "management" and eliminating third-class seedlings in the struggle to win a bumper harvest of early rice, so as to balance the growth of seedlings. It was decided to process and add fertilizer to strengthen the cultivation and management of intermediate and single-season late rice. According to different conditions, all parts of the county adopted four methods to strengthen the management of third-class seedlings of intermediate and single-season late rice: first, for fields with insufficient base fertilizer, apply a large amount of fine fertilizer such as human manure, cattle manure, and ammonium sulfate; second, in addition to applying hot fertilizers to cold and waterlogged fields to raise the soil temperature, ditches were generally opened to drain cold water; third, cut all the weeds on the edges of shaded fields to increase sunlight and soil temperature; fourth, for fields with serious insect pests, repeatedly control and eliminate them thoroughly. By June 19, more than 4 million dan of fertilizer had been applied throughout the county, 110,000 drainage ditches had been opened, and most of the third-class seedlings had generally been upgraded.

In the past, people did not pay enough attention to the production of late rice. Even if it was transplanted, it was allowed to grow on its own, and it was rarely fertilized and cultivated. There was a so-called saying that "late rice does not need fertilizer, it all depends on the autumn rain." The County Party Committee summarized the lessons learned from the past, where late rice was sown late and cultivated roughly, analyzed the potential for increasing late rice production, and put forward the slogan of "late rice competing with early rice." Subsequently, measures were taken to fully implement moistening the autumn fields, assigning special personnel to cultivate strong seedlings, reasonable close planting, changing the past phenomenon of random planting and over-sparse or over-dense planting, increasing base fertilizer, assigning special personnel to be responsible for field management, and launching cadres and the masses to engage in late rice experimental fields and high-yield plots to strive for a bumper harvest of late rice.

This year, they also paid special attention to coarse grain production. Farmers across the county changed their past habit of "harvesting if there is, discarding if there isn't" for sweet potatoes and coarse grains, and launched an "idle land" campaign to seize the season, race against time, strive for thousands of catties, and not leave an inch of land idle, to strive for an increase of 500 catties of coarse grains per household. By June 12, more than 20,000 mu of idle land had been found throughout the county, and more than 5,000 mu had been intercropped. In order to ensure that idle land was planted with sweet potatoes and coarse grains in a timely manner, various places adopted the method of dividing management scopes: large pieces of land were owned by the collective, and small pieces of land were planted by commune members, and it was implemented that whoever plants it, harvests it. Appropriate arrangements were also made in terms of fertilizer distribution ratio and labor. Subsequently, methods such as mutual borrowing and mutual buying were adopted to solve the shortage of seeds. In this way, the county planted and intercropped more than 30,000 mu of sweet potatoes, sorghum, corn, beans and other coarse grains in ten days, more than doubling the actual planting area of coarse grains last year. Now, the County Party Committee has proposed to cultivate sweet potatoes and coarse grains in the same way as rice. In addition to personally grasping coarse grain production by the first secretary of the County Party Committee, all eleven communes in the county have established coarse grain production command departments, and brigades and production teams have also established coarse grain production leading groups to lead coarse grain production.

### 抓每个季节　抓每项生产  攸县开展季季丰产运动

    抓每个季节　抓每项生产
    攸县开展季季丰产运动
    本报长沙1日电　中共湖南省攸县县委在“季季丰产，五谷丰登”的指导思想下，根据农事季节，不仅狠狠抓住了早稻生产，而且紧紧抓住了中稻和晚稻生产；不仅抓了稻谷生产，也抓红薯和其他杂粮生产。
    县委在提出了以早稻为起点，开展千斤丰产运动的口号以后，从去冬开始，便紧紧抓住以贯彻农业八字宪法为内容的早稻生产，早稻插秧以后，狠狠抓住“管”字，攻破返青、发兜、拔节、孕穗关，目前，早稻已普遍扬花灌浆，丰收在望。
    早稻普遍拔节孕穗的时候，全县十五万多亩中稻和一季晚稻生长很好，县委适时提出了“一季赛两季，单季赛过双季稻”的口号，并总结了争取早稻丰收斗争中狠抓
  “管”字，消灭三类禾，使禾苗平衡生长的经验。决定加工加肥，加强中稻和一季晚稻的培育管理。全县各地对中稻和一季晚稻的三类禾，根据不同情况，采取了四条办法来加强管理：一是底肥不足的田，大量追施人粪、牛粪、硫酸亚等精肥；二、对冷浸田除追施热性肥料提高泥温外，普遍开辟水沟，排除冷水；三、割尽荫山田边的野草，增加荫山田的日光照射和泥温；四、对虫害严重的田，反复除治，彻底消灭。到6月19日止，全县追肥四百多万担，开排水沟十一万条，大部分三类禾已普遍升级。
    过去，人们对晚稻的生产不够重视，即使插下了，也任它自生自长，很少追肥培育，有所谓“晚稻不要粪，全靠秋雨喷”的说法。县委总结了过去晚稻播得迟，耕作粗糙的教训，分析了晚稻的增产潜力，提出了“晚稻赛早稻”的口号。接着采取了全部实行湿润秋田，专人负责培育壮秧，合理密植，改变过去随手插和过稀过密的现象，增加底肥，确定专人负责田间管理，并发动干部和群众大搞晚稻试验田、丰产片等办法，来争取晚稻丰产。
    今年，他们也特别重视杂粮生产。全县农民改变了过去对红薯杂粮“有就收，没就丢”的习惯，兴起了一个“抢季节，分秒必争，夺千斤，寸土不闲”的争取每户增收杂粮五百斤的无闲地运动。到6月12日止，全县找出了闲地面积二万多亩，另外套种面积五千多亩。为了使空闲地及时种下红薯和杂粮，各地采取了划分经营范围：大块土地归集体，小块土地归社员种，并实行了谁种谁收。所用肥料，也从肥料分配比例与劳动方面作了适当的安排。接着，又采取了互借、互买等办法，解决了缺种困难。这样，全县在十天内就播种、套种了三万多亩红薯、高粱、玉米、豆荚等杂粮，比去年杂粮实际播种面积增加两倍多。现在，县委提出了要像培植稻谷一样来培植红薯和杂粮。县委第一书记除亲自抓杂粮生产，全县的十一个公社都成立了杂粮生产指挥部，大队和生产队也成立了杂粮生产领导小组，来领导杂粮生产。　（刘耀黎）
