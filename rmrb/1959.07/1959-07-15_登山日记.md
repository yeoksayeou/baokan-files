    Mountain Climbing Diary
    Wang Fengtong Yang Kexian
      Snowbound
      July 4th. Waiting.
    Today's heavy snow has caused the climbing team to remain at the second high-altitude camp, 6,200 meters above sea level, for a day.
    Words cannot describe the unbearable emotions of the team members. After waking up in the morning, the forty-odd members sat separately in twelve low tents. Snow fell softly on the tents. The members poked their heads out of the tents, the sky filled with dark, heavy clouds. Snowflakes drifted into the tents as the entrances were opened.
    The time to depart has arrived. To advance, or to retreat? The headquarters has not issued an order. Could it be that we will retreat back to base camp? Wouldn't that be a pointless expenditure of energy! Because the second march had already reached this altitude. Advance? Can we guarantee a smooth and safe arrival at the summit in this weather?
    It is already twelve o'clock noon. But the sky is as dark as dusk. Everyone is impatient, and many people come out of their tents to discuss in small groups. Some gesticulate and study the clouds in the sky, while others observe the wind direction. Snowflakes fall on them, and it seems that the weather holds no hope of improving.
    Comrade Shi Zhanchun squatted in a corner outside the tent, looking up at the sky in silence. One of the members saw that he was troubled and suggested returning to the tent to play cards, but he didn't even move, squatting in the snow and saying, "My only interest today is the weather!"
    Weather, only at this time do we realize how important it is! Shao Ziqing and Hu Deming from the weather group had already moved instruments such as anemometers, wind vanes, thermometers, and barometers to the snowy ground outside the tent early in the morning. They went there to observe and record every now and then. During the march, they carried heavy instrument boxes with the members, and whenever the members rested, they carried out observations of meteorological elements and radiation intensity at different altitudes. At that time, few people asked them questions. But now, the members are asking so urgently. Whether it is out of the caution of a scientific worker, or out of the same anxiety as the other members, they rarely answer the members' inquiries about the future weather directly.
    It is almost dinner time, and the stoves in the tents are making a sputtering sound. The members of the weather group packed the instruments into the boxes with smiles on their faces. After a day's work, how they hoped to have a delicious dinner! But they ran to Comrade Shi Zhanchun, who was still squatting there, and excitedly said to him: "The low-pressure cold air mass will pass tomorrow, and good weather is coming!"
    "I suggest we advance immediately to 6,800 meters above sea level tomorrow!" This was the voice of Shi Zhanchun. In the evening, the team headquarters made a decision: continue to advance tomorrow. (To be continued)

    登山日记

      雪阻
      7月4日。等待。
    今天大雪，登山队在拔海六千二百米的第二号高山营地停留了一天。
    无论用什么语言都难以形容队员们难耐的情绪。早晨起床后，四十多名队员分别坐在十二顶低矮的帐篷中。大雪沙沙地落在帐篷上。队员们把头伸出帐篷外，天空布满黑沉沉的阴云。随着帐篷口的打开，雪花就飘进帐篷中来了。
    出发的时候到了。是前进，还是后退？队部没有发出命令。难道就这样退回大本营吗？那岂不是作了一次毫无意义的消耗体力的行军！因为第二次行军就已经达到了这样的高度。前进吗？这样的天气能不能保证顺利地没有危险地到达顶峰呢？
    时间已经是中午十二点了。但天色却和黄昏时候一样。大家耐不住了，很多人钻出帐篷三三两两地议论起来。有的指手划脚地研究天上的阴云，有些在观测风向。雪花纷纷落在他们的身上，看起来，天气没有一线好转的希望。
    史占春同志蹲在帐篷外一个角落里仰望天空，默默无语。有一个队员看见他烦闷，建议回帐篷打打扑克，他却连动也不动，蹲在雪中说道：“今天我唯一的兴趣是气象！”
    气象，只有在这时候才感到它多么重要！气象小组的邵子庆和胡德铭，一早就把风速仪、风向仪、温度表、气压表等仪器搬到帐篷外的雪地上。他们每隔一会，就到那里观测、纪录。在行军当中，他们曾经背着沉重的仪器箱和队员们一起前进，每当队员们休息，他们便进行不同高度的气象要素和辐射强度的观测。那时，很少有人向他们发问。而现在，队员们却问得这样急。也不知是出于一个科学工作者的慎重，还是出于和其他队员一样的焦急心情，他们却很少正面回答队员们对未来天气的询问。
    快吃晚饭了，帐篷里的汽炉发出了嘟嘟的响声。气象组的队员面带着笑容把仪器收拾进箱中。工作一天了，多么希望吃到一顿很香的晚餐哪！那知他们却跑到依然蹲在那里的史占春同志的面前，兴奋地向他说道：“低压的冷气流明天就要过去，好天气就要到来了！”
    “建议明天马上向拔海六千八百米处挺进！”这是史占春的声音。晚上，队部作出了决定：明天继续前进。　（六续）
