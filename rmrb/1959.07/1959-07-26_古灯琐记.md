　　Random Notes on Ancient Lamps
　　Fei Bai

　　Since ancient times, the night has never been a friend to mankind. The darkness of night restricts people's activities and is a good time for wild animals to roam. Imagine how the early human ancestors living in the primitive forests would curse the darkness! Finally, people mastered fire. This was not due to the mercy of the gods, nor the achievement of Prometheus, but the result of human "labor." The Peking Man, who lived half a million years ago, already knew how to use fire. Fire became the most precious asset of the people at that time and the only tool to drive away the darkness.

　　Long years passed, and people continued to use torches as lighting tools. The materials used to make torches included fatty pine wood, reeds, hemp bundles, and various kinds of wood and firewood.

　　It was a great step forward to know how to use oil for lighting lamps. The oil materials were mostly animal fat or vegetable oil. The Erya Shishi states: "A pottery dou is called a deng, which is a膏登 (gao deng, oily lamp)," indicating that China was already using oil lamps at least in the Zhou Dynasty. The Chu Ci (Songs of Chu) Zhao Hun (Summoning the Soul) contains the phrase "華镫错些 (hua deng cuo xie, ornate lamps are arranged)," which further illustrates that metal lamps were also used during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. Since lamps were made of metal, Xu Shen's "Shuowen Jiezi (Explaining and Analyzing Characters)" writes the character for lamp as "镫 (deng)," with the metal radical.

　　By the Western Han Dynasty, the shape, type, and texture of lamps were more complex and refined than before, and there are many surviving material objects. At that time, pottery and bronze lamps were the most common, and iron lamps also appeared. In terms of shape, there was the "high lamp" with a thin handle and shallow plate, which was very similar to the "dou" in bronze ware. Even this type had many variations, either with a large flared foot or with raised patterns or other decorations on the handle. The Shuowen Jiezi entry for the character "主 (zhu, master)" states: "主 (zhu), is the fire-holder in the lamp. It resembles its shape," which is actually an image of this type of lamp. Some lamps had a goose-foot-shaped base, such as the Jianzhao Goose-Foot Bronze Lamp. There were also "traveling lamps" or "candle dou" with handles. After the Eastern Han Dynasty, a type of lamp with a long stand and multiple lights became popular. On a long stand, it was divided into multiple branches, each holding several lamp holders, often three to nine in number, and decorated with various floral and leaf ornaments. More complex ones, such as a three-tiered vermilion bird nine-branched lamp unearthed in 1956 in Shan County, Henan Province, were exceptionally gorgeous (top right picture). A bronze ox lamp unearthed in Changsha in 1949 is light green, with ears drooping downward, and the ox horns rising from both sides, merging into a compound bowl shape at the top, used as a "smoke vent" (bottom left picture). There is a round hole in the middle of the ox's back, on which is placed a round lamp holder with a handle. The ox's abdomen is hollow, serving as an oil reservoir. There is also an inscription on the right side of the ox's body, "敕庙牛镫四礼乐长监治 (Chì miào niú dèng sì lǐyuè zhǎng jiān zhì, Imperial Temple Ox Lamp, supervised by the head of ritual music)," making it a masterpiece of Han lamps.

　　Since the Jin Dynasty, celadon wares were widely used, and lamps were no exception. The celadon lamps discovered from the Jin and Southern Dynasties to the Sui Dynasty mostly consisted of a round plate at the bottom, with a lamp column standing in the center of the round plate, and a lamp holder on top, with the lamp holder either made separately or integrated with the column. Moreover, since the style of using lotus patterns as decorative motifs was very popular since the Six Dynasties, celadon lamps also often used lotus flowers as decoration. With the improvement of porcelain craftsmanship, porcelain lamps also became increasingly exquisite. A Tang Dynasty jewel-decorated lotus pedestal long-necked white porcelain lamp unearthed in Sanmenxia City is beautifully shaped, with a bright glaze color, and extremely exquisite.

　　The use of candles as lighting tools came later. The Shuowen Jiezi states, "烛 (zhu, candle), refers to the torches in the courtyard," actually still referring to torches. After the Han Dynasty, in addition to using hemp or bundled reeds soaked in oil to make candles, people began to use wax to make candles. The Jin Shu (Book of Jin) has the sentence "周顗弟嵩，以所执蜡烛投之 (Zhou Yi's younger brother Song threw the candle he was holding at him)." The use of the two characters "蜡烛 (lazhu, wax candle)" together proves that wax was indeed used to make candles at that time. However, wax candles were still a relatively expensive lighting tool in the Western Jin Dynasty. It is said that the wealthy Shi Chong used candle flames to cook food to show his extravagance.

　　Until the Qing Dynasty, candles and oil lamps were still the main lighting tools in China. Ming Dynasty Song Yingxing's "Tiangong Kaiwu (The Exploitation of the Works of Nature)" records the method of making candles from tallow oil, using tallow seeds that are steamed, pounded, ground, and squeezed, and then poured into bamboo or paper tubes to form candles. Their quality is very high, so "this candle can be placed in the wind and dust and exposed to cold and heat without decaying." (Attached pictures)

    古灯琐记
    非白
    黑夜，自古以来就不是人类的朋友，夜幕漆黑，限制了人们的活动，又是野兽活动的好时光。试想在原始森林中生活的人类远祖，会如何的来诅咒黑夜啊！终于人们掌握了火，这不是由于天神的慈悲，也不是普罗密修斯的功绩，而是人类“劳动”的结晶。生活在五十万年以前的中国猿人，已经会用火了。火成为当时人们最宝贵的财产，也成为驱除黑暗的唯一工具。
    漫长的岁月过去了，人们一直利用火炬来作照明的工具。构成火炬的材料有多脂的松木，也有芦苇、麻束和各种各样的木材与柴草。
    懂得用油来点灯，是很大的进步，油料多是兽脂或植物油。尔雅释器：“瓦豆谓之登，即膏登也”，可见我国至少在周代即已用油灯。楚辞招魂中有“华镫错些”之句，又说明春秋战国也用金属制灯。灯既用金属制成，所以许慎“说文”中灯字作“镫”，从金旁。
    到了西汉，灯的形状、种类、质地都比以前复杂精致，实物材料遗存的也很多。当时以陶和铜质的灯最普遍，还出现了铁灯。在形状上，有细柄浅盘的“高灯”，很像青铜器中的“豆”，就这一种来说，也有许多变化，或者把下面作成大喇叭口式足，或者在柄上加有凸纹或其他装饰。说文主字条：“主，镫中火主也。从呈，象形”，实际上就是这类灯的形象。有把灯足作雁足形状，如建昭雁足铜灯。有带把的“行灯”或“烛豆”。东汉以后，流行一种长檠多盏的灯，在一只长檠上，分成多枝，分托着几个灯盏，数目常常是三到九个，并且作出各种花叶装饰。更复杂的，像1956年在河南陕县出土的汉代陶灯中，有一件三级的朱雀九支灯，异常华丽（右上图）。1949年在长沙出土铜牛镫一件，淡绿色，耳向下垂，牛角从两侧竖起，至顶部合而为一，呈复碗状，作“出烟管”用（左下图）。牛背中部有圆洞，其上置有带把圆灯盏。牛腹中空，为贮油器。牛体右侧还有“敕庙牛镫四礼乐长监治”的铭文，为汉灯之精品。
    两晋以来，青瓷器普遍使用，灯也不例外。已发现的两晋、南朝以至隋的青瓷灯，多是下设一圆盘，圆盘中立灯柱，上座灯盏，灯盏或与柱分制合成。又因六朝以来，以莲花纹作装饰图案之风大盛，故青瓷灯也常用莲花作装饰。随着瓷器工艺水平的提高，瓷灯也日趋精美。三门峡市出土过一件唐代宝装莲座长颈白瓷灯，造型漂亮，釉色莹明，极其精美。
    采用蜡烛作照明工具，较迟一些，说文谓“烛，庭燎火烛也”，实际上仍指火炬而言。汉代以后，除用麻或束苇渍油作烛外，已开始用蜡作烛了，晋书有“周顗弟嵩，以所执蜡烛投之”一句，“蜡烛”二字连用，足证当时确已使用蜡来作烛了。但西晋时蜡烛还是一种价格较高的照明工具，据说当时曾有富翁石崇用蜡烛火焰来作饭，以示其奢侈豪华。
    直到清代，蜡烛和油灯始终是我国主要的照明工具。明宋应星“天工开物”中记有皮油造烛法，用桕子经蒸、碓、磨、榨以后，以竹筒或纸筒灌注成烛，其质量甚高，故“此烛任置风尘中，再经寒暑，不敝坏也”。（附图片）
