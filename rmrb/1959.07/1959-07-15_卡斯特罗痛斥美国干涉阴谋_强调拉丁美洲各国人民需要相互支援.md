Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 13th: Premier Castro last night at the closing session of the land reform debate in the capital, vehemently denounced the United States' conspiracy to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs, and emphasized that the people of Latin America need to support each other, and not believe the lies fabricated by American imperialist slanderous propaganda.

He pointed out that the powerful groups affected by the Cuban revolution are trying to discredit the Cuban revolution, describing the turbulent situation in the Caribbean region as a result of Cuba stirring up trouble, "so that one day when these foreign interest groups need to eliminate us, the Cuban people, our brotherly people will not protest. ... But we all know who is to blame for the events currently taking place in Latin America. ... Like what happened in most American countries, the Cuban revolution is precisely the result of the rampant actions of these foreign interest groups. Cuba's only crime is demanding the liberation of its motherland."

Castro then reiterated his firm opposition to the new trick of the United States to interfere in Cuba's internal affairs - convening a meeting of the foreign ministers of the Organization of American States to "discuss the situation in the Caribbean." He said, "When Cuba massacred fifty-three farmers in one afternoon, when weapons were constantly smuggled from the United States, the Dominican Republic, and Nicaragua to equip the armies of those dictatorial regimes that had bloodied our country, at that time no one said anything about the turbulence and instability in the Caribbean region, no one thought of convening a meeting of the American foreign ministers, and no one organized a commission of investigation to expose the crimes committed by the Cuban dictatorial regime."

Castro then rebuked the United States for sheltering Diaz Lanz, the former Cuban Air Force Commander wanted by the Cuban government. He said, "We have seen that any shameless person, swindler, rogue, and deserter of the revolution is a somebody in the United States. ... They treat traitors as honored guests, ... and then secretly take them to testify before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, as if we have threatened the domestic security of the United States. They thus sometimes use gold, sometimes use flattery, to lure the villains and traitors among the people, attempting to reward defection. ... But if they think that the people will panic as a result, then they have miscalculated. On the contrary, the revolution will become increasingly strong, because the revolutionary forces united can unleash the invincible power of the people."

Castro then warned that we are now holding weapons exchanged for our blood, many of which were made in the United States and the Dominican Republic, standing by to defend our motherland, because "we will never allow any country to interfere in our internal affairs. ... The feelings of the people cannot be trampled on, and international conspiracies can only make the Cuban revolution stronger."

Before Castro's speech, a representative, in the name of all Latin American representatives, read out a statement at the debate in support of the Cuban land reform.

Thus, the fifteen-day Cuban First Land Reform Debate ended victoriously.

    卡斯特罗痛斥美国干涉阴谋
    强调拉丁美洲各国人民需要相互支援
    新华社哈瓦那13日电　卡斯特罗总理昨晚在首都土地改革辩论会的闭幕会上痛斥美国干涉古巴内政的阴谋，并强调指出，拉丁美洲人民需要相互支援，不要相信美帝国主义诽谤宣传所捏造的谎言。
    他指出，因为古巴革命而受到影响的强权集团力图中伤古巴革命，把加勒比海地区动荡的局势说成是古巴兴风作浪的结果，“以便有朝一日这些外国利益集团需要消灭我们古巴人民的时候，兄弟人民不至于提出抗议。……但是，我们大家都知道，拉丁美洲目前所发生的事件是谁的过错造成的。……正像大多数美洲国家中所发生的事情一样，古巴革命正是那些外国利益集团横行霸道的结果。古巴唯一的罪过是要求解放它的祖国”。
    卡斯特罗接着重申坚决反对美国干涉古巴内政的新伎俩——召开美洲国家外长会议来“讨论加勒比海的局势”。他说，“当古巴在一个下午就屠杀五十三个农民的时候，当经常从美国、多米尼加和尼加拉瓜偷偷运送武器来装备那些血洗我国的独裁政权的军队的时候，那时候谁也没说什么加勒比地区动乱不稳，谁也没想起要召开美洲外长会议，没有组织调查委员会来揭露古巴独裁政权所犯的罪行”。
    卡斯特罗接着斥责美国收容受到古巴政府通缉的前古巴空军司令迪亚斯·兰斯。他说，“我们已经看到，任何一个不要脸的人、骗子手、无耻者和革命的逃兵在美国都是个人物。……他们把卖国贼当作上宾，……然后把他们秘密地带到参议院国内安全小组委员会上作证，竟好像是我们威胁了美国的国内安全。他们就这样有时用黄金、有时用捧场来诱引人民中的恶棍和叛徒，企图奖励叛变行为。……但是，如果以为这样一来人民就会惊惶失措，那么他们就打错了算盘。完全相反，革命将日益强大，因为革命力量团结起来就能发挥出不可战胜的人民的力量。”
    卡斯特罗接着警告说，现在我们正擎着用我们的鲜血换来的武器，其中有许多武器是在美国和多米尼加制造的，严阵以待地保卫我们的祖国，因为“我们决不允许任何国家干涉我国的内政。……人民的感情不容践踏，国际阴谋只能使古巴革命更加强大。”
    在卡斯特罗讲话前，有一位代表以拉丁美洲全体代表的名义在辩论会上宣读了一项支持古巴土地改革的声明。
    至此，为期十五天的古巴第一次土改辩论会以胜利告终。
