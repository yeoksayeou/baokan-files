Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 22nd: The "Akahata" newspaper published an article on the 21st exposing that the United States Congress is examining a bill to permanently buy the Ogasawara Islands for six million dollars. The more than seven thousand residents of the Ogasawara Islands were forcibly relocated to mainland Japan by the Japanese army during the Second World War. After Japan's surrender, and due to the US military occupation of the Ogasawara Islands, these displaced Ogasawara residents have still not been able to return to their hometowns.

    美国想用六百万美元代价永久收买小笠原群岛
    据新华社22日讯　东京消息：“赤旗报”在21日发表文章揭露说，美国国会正在审讯一项以六百万美元来永久收买小笠原群岛的法案。小笠原群岛的七千多名居民在第二次世界大战期间被日本军队强迫命令迁住日本内地。日本投降以后，又由于美军占据小笠原群岛，这批流浪在外的小笠原居民至今还不能回到自己的故乡。
