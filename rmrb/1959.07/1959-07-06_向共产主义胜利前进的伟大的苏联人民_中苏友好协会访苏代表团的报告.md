The Great Soviet People Marching Towards Communist Victory
——Report of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Delegation's Visit to the Soviet Union
Cao Jinghua, Head of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Delegation

At the invitation of the Union of Soviet Societies for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Association, our Sino-Soviet Friendship Association sent a delegation to the great friendly country of the Soviet Union for a seventeen-day friendly visit from June 9th to 25th. We visited the three major cities of Moscow, Leningrad, and Stalingrad, as well as the Republic of Georgia. During our visit, we toured many factories, farms, construction projects, cultural and educational institutions, and revolutionary historical sites. We held forums or meetings with activists from local Soviet-Chinese Friendship Associations and had extensive contact with our Soviet brothers and sisters—workers, peasants, intellectuals, and children. During the visit, many responsible Party and government comrades talked to us. On the day of our departure, Comrade Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, met with us. Our delegation gained greatly from this visit. The construction achievements of the Soviet Union and the great friendship of the Soviet people towards the Chinese people greatly encouraged us and profoundly educated us.

Our visit to the Soviet Union took place after the Soviet Communist Party's historically significant 21st Congress and before the June Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU. As everyone knows, the 21st Congress of the CPSU formulated the magnificent Seven-Year Plan, thereby fully launching a new period of communist social construction. The June Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU was a meeting to review the implementation of the Seven-Year Plan and discuss concrete measures to realize the decisions of the 21st Party Congress. Therefore, the main aspects of our visit and observation, and what we were particularly concerned about, were naturally closely related to the Seven-Year Plan.

The most important fact we witnessed during our visit to the Soviet Union was the vigorous and surging political enthusiasm and labor activism of the Soviet people in realizing the resolutions of the 21st Congress of the CPSU. The concentrated expression of this enthusiasm and activism is the nationwide socialist competition, which is a mass competition to accelerate the realization of the Seven-Year Plan. In the competition, many regions and enterprises in the Soviet Union have responded to the initiative of the workers in the industry and construction sectors of the Sverdlovsk Economic Region, boosting their morale and creative spirit, adopting new technologies, updating equipment, and tapping all potentials to strive to complete the Seven-Year Plan in six, five, or even shorter periods. Taking Moscow, which we visited, as an example: The workers of the "Red Proletarian" and six other lathe manufacturing plants in the Moscow (city) economic region guaranteed to produce 56% more products than the task predetermined by the Seven-Year Plan by 1965. The workers of the Moscow Tire Factory guaranteed to complete the Seven-Year Plan in five years based on their production level. The deployment of the Moscow "Bolshevik" Collective Farm is to "complete the Seven-Year Plan in four years." In the competition, many factory workers also proposed to strive for the glorious title of "Communist Labor Brigade."

The resolution of the June Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU pointed out that comprehensive mechanization and automation of the production process is the basic method of technological innovation, and without this innovation, it is impossible to further increase labor productivity at high speed. The Soviet people have already made great achievements in this regard. The labor competition currently unfolding in the Soviet Union is a socialist labor competition that widely adopts new technologies and vigorously promotes mechanization and automation. We visited the First Ball Bearing Factory in Moscow. Over the years, the factory has relied entirely on its own strength, improving while producing, and has established seven automated production lines and twenty mechanized conveyor belts, automating and modernizing 1,500 lathes and thousands of machines belonging to control, lifting, and transmission. We visited an automated workshop in this factory. In this workshop, twenty or thirty processes such as lathes, drilling machines, milling machines, heat treatment, assembly, and even packaging are automatically completing their tasks. The labor productivity of this automated workshop is twice as high as that of an ordinary workshop of the same size, and the service life of the bearings it produces is one to four times longer than that of ordinary workshops. We also visited the Stalingrad Tractor Factory. The factory's automated conveyor belt is 10,000 meters long, and many of the factory's casting workshops have also been automated. We firmly believe that the achievements made by these two factories, their automated and mechanized equipment, and the resulting increase in labor productivity will become the achievements of all Soviet factories through the socialist labor competition that is widely unfolding throughout the Soviet Union.

Accompanying the Soviet people's vigorous political enthusiasm and production activism is a new production upsurge, and the Soviet Union has achieved new and significant achievements in industrial and agricultural production in the first half of this year. The implementation of the Soviet national economic plan in the first half of this year was very good. Countless factories, enterprises, and construction sites greeted the convocation of the June Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU with actions to complete their production plans for the first half of the year ahead of schedule. In the first half of the first year of the Seven-Year Plan, the development speed of Soviet industry was faster than stipulated in the plan. Compared with the first half of last year, the total industrial output value increased by 11% from January to June this year, while the task for this year only stipulated an increase of 7.7%. When we held a joint celebration with the workers of the Sherbakov Silk Weaving Factory in Moscow, the representatives of the factory told us that their factory had completed the production plan for the first half of the year ahead of schedule on June 17th. As for the Kirovgrad Coupling Machine Factory, it even completed the production plan for the first half of the year ahead of schedule on June 11th. Regarding the achievements in agricultural production, the speed of spring sowing work in the Soviet Union this year is also unprecedented, and the development of animal husbandry is particularly good. In 1959, almost all parts of the Soviet Union had all the necessary conditions to achieve a bumper harvest of grains, technical crops, feed crops, potatoes, vegetables, and fruits.

While industrial and agricultural production is developing rapidly, the material living standards of the Soviet people are also rapidly improving. What impressed us most was the development of housing construction. When we visited Leningrad, Comrade Sterzhikovsky, Deputy Chairman of the City Soviet, specifically introduced us to the development of housing construction in Leningrad. In 1955, the city built a total of 405,000 square meters of housing; last year, the housing construction area reached 732,500 square meters; and this year, the housing construction area will reach 900,000 square meters. As for Moscow, people who have been there recently know that on the way from the city to Vnukovo Airport, a brand-new area has been built—the Southwest District of Moscow City. In this area, most of the buildings are residential houses. When we visited the Orjonikidze Collective Farm in Georgia, we also found new houses being built everywhere. And during the entire Seven-Year Plan period, the total area of Soviet housing construction will be equivalent to fifteen large cities like Moscow. During our visit, we also saw that the Soviet people were fully supplied with necessities, and the stores were full of goods. Due to the great improvement in living standards and purchasing power, in Leningrad, we found people queuing up to buy carpets, which is probably a rare thing in the current world.

The major achievements made by the Soviet people, armed with the ideas of the 21st Congress of the CPSU, after the Congress have not only great economic significance but also great political significance. It will not only directly inspire the Soviet people's struggle to realize the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule, but also powerfully inspire the people of our country and all socialist countries, giving us greater confidence in accelerating the realization of our huge construction plans. At the same time, the words "Seven-Year Plan" have spread all over the world and aroused the praise of all progressive humanity. From the major achievements made by the Soviet Union in the recent period, we can draw a conclusion that the decisions passed by the 21st Congress of the CPSU are completely correct, and the Seven-Year Plan for further developing the Soviet economy and culture and improving the material welfare of the people will be completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled, thereby inevitably having a profound impact on the development of the world.

During our visit to the Soviet Union, we also visited the magnificent Soviet National Economic Achievement Exhibition, which had just opened recently. This exhibition is a grand review of the brilliant construction achievements of the Soviet Union in the peaceful competition with capitalist countries. In this review, we not only saw the amazing achievements made by the Soviet Union in the past forty years, especially in recent years, but also saw the material basis for the inevitable victorious realization of the Seven-Year Plan, and at the same time, we can foresee the brilliant tomorrow of Soviet communist construction.

Whether in the revolutionary war or in socialist construction, the great Soviet Union has given our country comprehensive and enormous assistance, which is an important condition for our continuous victories. After the 21st Congress of the CPSU, the Soviet Union and our country signed an agreement to expand economic cooperation. According to the agreement, during the period from 1959 to 1967, the Soviet Union will help our country build 78 large-scale industrial enterprises and power stations. During our visit to the Soviet Union, we had the opportunity to visit some factories that manufacture the above-mentioned equipment for our country. The Kirov Electric Machinery Factory in Leningrad, which we visited, is the factory that provides the main equipment for our country's Sanmenxia Hydropower Station. The Soviet Union not only provides our country with important industrial equipment, but also trains a large number of construction personnel for our country. We saw our country's students, graduate students, and interns everywhere in the Soviet Union. For example, Moscow University, which we visited, has the largest number of foreign students currently training at the school, with a total of 420 students from our country. The great communist construction projects we visited - the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station, as well as the Stalingrad Tractor Factory and the Kirov Electric Machinery Factory in Leningrad, have trained many interns for our country. When we visited the Soviet Union, we also met many old friends of the Chinese people, heroic figures who were full of proletarian internationalism, who either fought side by side with us in the war or contributed to our construction. We will not forget the meeting at the South Caucasus Iron and Steel Plant in Georgia and the factory's chief engineer, Comrade Mareshev. Comrade Mareshev had been in our country for a long time to help our country's construction, and he made contributions to the construction of our country's important steel bases, Angang, Wuhan Iron and Steel, and Baogang. We will also not forget the meeting with Comrade Podorov, Deputy Chief Engineer of the Power Engineering Department of the First Ball Bearing Factory, when we visited the First Ball Bearing Factory. He also made contributions to the construction of our country's Luoyang Bearing Factory. When they bid farewell, they asked us to convey their greetings to their old Chinese friends. Every time we met with old friends and reminisced about the past, every time we thought of the Soviet people's lofty internationalist spirit and sincere friendship towards our country, our hearts naturally welled up with the gratitude of our people towards the elder brother.

Throughout the entire visit, we were not only encouraged by the brilliant achievements of the Soviet people, but also deeply moved by the great friendship shown by the Soviet people towards our people. We received a warm and grand reception throughout our visit to the Soviet Union. The Soviet people treated us like family, making each of our delegation members feel at home. We could see sincere friendship towards the Chinese people everywhere. Everywhere we went, people greeted us with "Hello!" In the seaside of Georgia, an elderly man with a smiling face met us and shouted enthusiastically to us: "Salute to the great People's Republic of China!" Whether in parks or in factories, we could see galleries introducing our country's construction achievements everywhere. The Soviet people regard our people's festivals as their own festivals. We heard the hosts in many places introduce to us the preparations they were making to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The Union of Societies for Friendship and Cultural Exchange with Foreign Countries and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, which were responsible for receiving us, took meticulous care of us. Since its establishment, the Union of Societies for Friendship and Cultural Exchange with Foreign Countries has done a lot of effective work. Under the Union, there are now twenty-eight foreign friendship groups. Although the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has not been established for a long time, it already has many local organizations in various union republics and major cities of the Soviet Union, uniting a large number of activists and making many outstanding contributions, which is worthy of our good learning. All these facts of Sino-Soviet friendship have left a deep impression on us. Of course, the most moving thing for us was that Comrade Khrushchev met with us during the tense Central Plenary Session, talked with us in the most cordial and friendly atmosphere, and expressed his warm feelings for the Chinese people. This is something we will never forget.

As we were about to leave the Soviet Union, we deeply felt that the great Soviet people are doing new and earth-shattering undertakings in the world. The most lofty ideal of mankind: building a paradise on earth - a communist society, will become a living reality in the near future through the great practice of the Soviet people. This is the inevitable trend of historical development, and it cannot be reversed by any force. At the same time, we also deeply felt how significant and profound it is that the great Chinese people and the great Soviet people are advancing hand in hand in the same direction and along the same road! The great friendship and unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union is invincible. No force in the world can shake the great unity between China and the Soviet Union, no force can separate the people of our two countries, and no force can stop the continuous development and consolidation of the friendly cooperation between our two countries.

We must not only unswervingly unite with the Soviet Union, but also unswervingly learn from the Soviet Union. The happy today of the Soviet Union is our tomorrow. The heroic actions of the Soviet people in the cause of building socialism and communism and their noble ideas of proletarian internationalism will always be a model for us to learn from.

We came to the Soviet Union with the love and gratitude of the Chinese people for the great Soviet people, and now we have returned to our motherland full of the deep friendship of the Soviet people for our people. We firmly believe that through this visit, the friendship and unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union will be further promoted.

Let us sincerely wish the Soviet people to complete the magnificent Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule and over fulfill it! Wishing the Soviet people to enter the paradise of mankind - communist society sooner! Long live the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union!

    向共产主义胜利前进的伟大的苏联人民
    ——中苏友好协会访苏代表团的报告
    中苏友好协会访苏代表团团长　曹靖华
    我们中苏友好协会，接受苏联对外友好和文化联系协会联合会及苏中友好协会的邀请，派出了访苏代表团，从6月9日到25日，到伟大的友邦苏联作了十七天的友好访问。我们访问过的地方包括莫斯科、列宁格勒、斯大林格勒三大城市和格鲁吉亚共和国。在我们进行访问的时候，参观过许多工厂、农庄、建设工程、文教机关和革命史迹，与各地苏中友好协会的积极分子开了座谈会或见面会，并和苏联的兄弟姊妹——工人、农民、知识分子、少年儿童进行了广泛的接触。在访问期间，许多党政负责同志和我们谈了话，在临别的那一天，苏共中央第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫同志接见了我们。我们代表团这次的访问得到极大的收获，苏联的建设成就和苏联人民对中国人民的伟大友谊给了我们极大的鼓舞，使我们受到了深刻的教育。
    我们这次到苏联访问，正当具有重大历史意义的苏共第二十一次代表大会之后和苏共中央六月全会的前夕。像大家所知道的，苏共第二十一次代表大会制订了宏伟的七年计划，从此全面展开了共产主义社会建设的新时期；而苏共中央六月全会是检查七年计划的执行情况并讨论实现党的二十一次代表大会决议的具体措施问题的会议。因此，我们访问和参观的主要方面，我们所特别关心的事情，自然是和七年计划有密切关系的事情。
    我们在苏联访问期间所看到的最重要的事实，是苏联人民为实现苏共第二十一次代表大会决议而激起的蓬勃高涨的政治热情和劳动积极性。这种热情和积极性的集中表现，是在全国范围内广泛展开的全民的社会主义竞赛，也就是加速实现七年计划的群众性竞赛。在竞赛中，苏联许多地区和许多企业的劳动者，纷纷响应斯维德洛夫斯克经济区的工业和建筑业劳动者的倡议，鼓起干劲和创造精神，采用新技术，更新设备，挖掘一切潜力，争取在六年、五年或者更短的时间内完成七年计划。以我们访问过的莫斯科为例：莫斯科（市）经济区的“红色无
  产者”等七个车床制造厂的职工，保证到1965年将比七年计划预定的任务多生产56％的产品；莫斯科轮胎制造厂的职工，保证按生产水
  平在五年内完成七年计划；莫斯科“布尔什维
  克”集体农庄的部署是“七年计划四年完成”。在竞赛中，很多工厂的职工还提出为争取“共产主义劳动队”的光荣称号而斗争。
    苏共中央六月全会的决议指出，生产过程的全盘机械化和自动化是技术革新的基本方法，没有这种革新就不可能进一步高速度提高劳动生产率。苏联人民在这方面已经取得了很大的成绩。目前正在苏联全面展开的劳动竞赛，就是一个广泛采用新技术、大搞机械化、自动化的社会主义劳动竞赛。我们在莫斯科参观了第一滚珠轴承工厂。几年以来，这个工厂完全依靠自己的力量，一边生产，一边改进，建立了七条自动化作业线，二十条机械化传送带，使一千五百多部车床，以及几千部属于控制、起落、传送的机器自动化和现代化了。我们参观了这个工厂的一个自动化车间。在这个车间里，车床、钻床、铣床、热处理、装配乃至包装等二、三十道工序，都自动地在完成着自己的任务。这个自动化车间的劳动生产率比同样大小的普通车间提高一倍，它所生产的轴承质量比普通车间生产的耐用时间长一倍至四倍。我们还参观了斯大林格勒的拖拉机工厂，这个厂的自动化传送带有一万公尺长，这个厂有许多铸造车间也已经自动化。我们深信，这两个工厂所取得的成就，它们所具有的自动化和机械化装备以及由此而提高的劳动生产率，必将通过全苏各地广泛展开的社会主义劳动竞赛成为所有苏联工厂的成就。
    伴随着苏联人民蓬勃高涨的政治热情和生产积极性同时到来的是新的生产高潮，是苏联在今年上半年在工农业生产方面所获得新的巨大成就。今年上半年苏联国民经济计划的执行情况非常良好。无数的工厂企业和建筑工地用提前完成上半年生产计划的行动来迎接苏共中央六月全会的召开。在七年计划头一年的上半年中，苏联工业的发展速度比计划规定的更快。同去年上半年相比，今年1月到6月工业总产值增长11％，而今年的任务只规定增长7.7％。当我们在莫斯科同谢尔巴科夫丝织厂的职工举行联欢会的时候，这个工厂的代表告诉我们，他们的工厂已经在6月17日提前完成了上半年的生产计划。至于基洛夫格勒的联动机工厂，甚至在6月11日就提前完成了上半年的生产计划。关于农业生产方面的成就，苏联今年春播工作进展之快也是前所未有的，而畜牧业发展的情况尤其良好。在1959年，几乎全苏联各地都有着一切必要的条件来使谷物、技术作物、饲料作物、马铃薯、蔬菜和水果得到丰收。
    在工农业生产迅速发展的同时，苏联人民的物质生活水平也正在迅速提高。使我们印象最深的是住宅建筑的发展。当我们在列宁格勒访问的时候，市苏维埃副主席斯特日科夫斯基同志特别向我们介绍了列宁格勒市在住宅建筑方面的发展情况。在1955年，全市共建筑了四十万零五千平方公尺的住宅；在去年，住宅建筑面积达到七十三万二千五百平方公尺；而在今年，住宅建筑面积更将达到九十万平方公尺。至于在莫斯科，最近到过那里的人都知道，在从市区到伏努科夫飞机场的途中，已经修起了一片崭新的区域——莫斯科市西南区，在这一区域中，绝大部分的建筑物是居民的住宅。当我们在格鲁吉亚参观奥尔忠尼启则集体农庄时，我们也发现那里到处在盖新的房子。而在整个七年计划期间，苏联住宅建筑的总面积将相当于十五座像莫斯科这样的大城市。我们在访问中还看到，苏联人民在生活必需品方面得到充分的供应，商店里货物丰富，应有尽有。由于生活水平和购买力的大大提高，在列宁格勒的时候，我们发现人们排着队在买地毯，在目前的世界上，这大概是很希罕的事。
    为苏共第二十一次代表大会的思想武装起来的苏联人民在代表大会以后所取得的这些重大成就，不仅有着巨大的经济意义，而且有着巨大的政治意义。它不仅将直接地鼓舞苏联人民为提前实现七年计划所进行的斗争，而且也将有力地鼓舞我国和所有社会主义国家的人民，使我们在加速实现自己的巨大建设计划时具有更大的信心。同时，“七年计划”这几个字也已经传遍了全世界，并引起了全体进步人类的赞扬。从苏联在最近期间所取得的重大成就可以得出一个结论，即苏共第二十一次代表大会所通过的决定是完全正确的，进一步发展苏联的经济、文化以及提高人民物质福利的七年计划必将提前和超额完成，从而也必将对全世界的发展产生深远的影响。
    在访问苏联期间，我们还参观了不久以前才开幕的规模宏伟的苏联国民经济成就展览会。这个展览会是苏联在和资本主义国家进行和平竞赛中取得辉煌建设成就的盛大检阅。在这个检阅中，我们不但看到苏联在四十几年来特别是最近几年来所取得的惊人成就，也看到七年计划必将胜利实现的物质基础，同时也可以预见到苏联共产主义建设的灿烂的明天。
    不论在革命战争中或者在社会主义建设中，伟大的苏联都曾给予我国全面的巨大的援助，这是我们不断地取得胜利的重要条件。苏共第二十一次代表大会以后，苏联和我国又签订了一项扩大经济合作的协定。根据协定，在1959年到1967年期间，苏联将再帮助我国建设七十八项大型工业企业和发电站。我们这次在苏联访问的时候，有机会亲自参观了一些为我国制造上述设备的工厂。我们在列宁格勒参观过的以基洛夫命名的电力机械工厂，就是为我国三门峡水电站提供主要设备的工厂。苏联不仅为我国提供重要的工业设备，而且为我国培养了大批的建设人材。我们在苏联到处看到我国的留学生、研究生和实习生。例如我们参观过的莫斯科大学，在这个学校目前培养的外国留学生中，以我国留学生为最多，共计四百二十人。在我们参观过的伟大的共产主义建设工程——斯大林格勒水电站，以及斯大林格勒的拖拉机工厂和列宁格勒的基洛夫电力机械工厂，都为我国培养了很多实习生。当我们在苏联访问的时候，我们还遇到了中国人民的许多老朋友，这些充满着无产阶级国际主义的英雄人物，或者在战争中和我们并肩作过战，或者在建设中为我们出过力。我们不会忘记在格鲁吉亚的南高加索钢铁厂和这个工厂的总工程师马雷歇夫同志的会见。马雷歇夫同志曾长期在我国帮助我国建设，他在我国重要钢铁基地鞍钢、武钢和包钢的建设中都立下了功劳。我们也不会忘记在第一滚珠轴承厂参观时和这个工厂动力工程副总工程师波德罗夫同志的会见，他在我国洛阳轴承厂的建设中也立下了功劳。他们在临别的时候，都要我们转达他们对中国老朋友的问好。每当我们和老朋友见面话旧的时候，每当我们想到苏联人民崇高的国际主义精神和对我国的真诚友谊的时候，我们的心中很自然地就涌现出我国人民对老大哥的感激之情。
    在整个访问中间，我们不仅为苏联人民的光辉成就所鼓舞，同时也因苏联人民对我国人民所表现出的伟大友谊而深受感动。我们在苏联整个访问期间都受到了热情而隆重的接待。苏联人民待我们亲如家人，使我们每个团员都有身在家乡的感觉。到处都可以看到对中国人民的真诚的友谊。每到一个地方，人们到处和我们打招呼“您好”！在格鲁吉亚的海滨，一位满脸笑容的老年人和我们迎面相遇，他对我们热情地高呼：“向伟大的中华人民共和国致敬！”不论在公园或者在工厂中，到处可以看到介绍我国建设成就的画廊。苏联人民把我国人民的节日当作他们自己的节日，我们在不少的地方听到主人向我们介绍他们为了庆祝中华人民共和国立国十周年所作的准备工作。负责接待我们的苏联对外友好和文化联系协会联合会及苏中友好协会对我们的关怀无微不至。苏联对外友好和文化联系协会联合会成立以来，作了很多有成效的工作，在联合会之下现在已经有二十八个对外友好团体。苏中友好协会成立的时间虽然不长，但它在苏联各加盟共和国和各大城市已经拥有很多的地方组织，团结了很大一批积极分子，并作出了许多出色的工作，值得我们很好地学习。所有这些苏中友好的事实，都给我们留下了深刻的印象。当然，使我们最受感动的一件事，是赫鲁晓夫同志在中央全会紧张进行时，在百忙中接见了我们，在最亲切友好的气氛中和我们谈了话，并且向我们表示了他对中国人民的热烈的情感。这是我们永远不会忘记的事。
    当我们将要离开苏联的时候，我们深深地感到，伟大的苏联人民正在世界上从事新的惊天动地的事业。人类最崇高的理想：建设人间的天堂——共产主义社会，将在不久的未来，通过苏联人民的伟大实践而成为活生生的现实。这是历史发展的必然趋势，这是任何力量不能扭转的。同时，我们也深深地感到，伟大的中国人民和伟大的苏联人民，朝着一个方向，沿着一条道路，携手前进，这该具有多么重大、多么深刻的意义！中苏两国人民的伟大友谊和团结是无敌的。世界上没有任何力量可以动摇中苏两国的伟大团结，没有任何力量可以把我们两国人民分开，没有任何力量可以阻拦我们国两人民友好合作的不断发展和巩固。
    我们不仅要坚定不移地和苏联团结一致，而且要坚定不移地向苏联学习。苏联的幸福的今天就是我们的明天。苏联人民在建设社会主义和共产主义事业中的英雄行为和他们的无产阶级国际主义的崇高思想，永远是我们学习的榜样。
    我们带着中国人民对伟大苏联人民的热爱和感谢到了苏联，现在又满载着苏联人民对我国人民的深厚情谊回到祖国来了。我们深信，通过这次访问，必将进一步促进中苏两国人民的友好和团结。
    让我们衷心地预祝苏联人民提前和超额完成宏伟的七年计划！预祝苏联人民更早地进入人类的天堂——共产主义社会！中苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
