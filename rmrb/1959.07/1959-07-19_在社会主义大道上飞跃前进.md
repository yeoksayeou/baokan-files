Leaping Forward on the Socialist Road
Gu Qingting (Tibetan), Member of the CPC Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture Committee

    From 1950 to the present, in just over nine years, the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture has undergone extremely profound changes, entering a new historical period of socialist great leap forward from an early feudal serfdom society.

    Like other minority nationality areas, the people of all nationalities in the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, mainly Tibetans, first enjoyed the right to national regional autonomy. The working people who were oppressed in the past have become masters of the country and their own destiny.

    For thousands of years, the feudal serf system, which heavily weighed on the people of all nationalities, was the root cause of their poverty and backwardness. The people of all nationalities could no longer live as they used to. The CPC Aba Prefecture Committee and the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee accepted the just demands of the masses, and, according to the policy of peaceful reform, adopted the method of combining top-down consultation with bottom-up mobilization of the masses to lead the democratic reform movement throughout the prefecture. From the winter of 1954 to the spring of 1956, democratic reforms were completed in the vast agricultural areas, and democratic reforms in pastoral areas also ended in 1958. The democratic reform achieved a great victory, abolishing the feudal land ownership system and all feudal privileges, implementing the peasant land ownership system and the collective ownership of grassland pastures by herdsmen, and liberating slaves and serfs, thereby changing the old relations of production and paving a broad road for the development of production.

    Immediately afterwards, under the guidance of the Party, the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen embarked on the socialist road of common prosperity, successively realizing advanced cooperativization in agricultural areas and elementary cooperativization in pastoral areas. In the second half of 1958, people's communes were also established in some areas.

    Encouraged by the Party's general line for building socialism and supported by the people of all nationalities in Sichuan Province, the people of all nationalities in the autonomous prefecture are full of vigor and soaring enthusiasm, and a great leap forward situation has emerged in all aspects of production and construction.

    In order to change the backward state of agricultural production, in recent years, the Party and the People's Government have led the people of all nationalities in carrying out much arduous and meticulous work, issuing large amounts of agricultural loans, relief, and free agricultural implements to solve the difficulties of farmers in production and life. They vigorously promoted advanced technology, new agricultural implements, and pesticides and machinery, built water conservancy projects, increased the application of fertilizers, and prevented and controlled plant diseases and insect pests, gradually implementing intensive cultivation. Primitive production tools have become historical relics.

    Due to the comprehensive implementation of the "Eight-Point Charter" for agricultural production, high-yield records have emerged in large numbers on the agricultural production front, and grain output has increased sharply. If the grain output in 1949 is taken as 100, it increased to 175 in 1957. In 1958, the prefecture overcame the worst drought in several years. The total grain output increased by 50% compared with 1957, equivalent to 206% of 1949, changing the long-term grain deficiency situation in the autonomous prefecture.

    In recent years, animal husbandry production has also greatly developed. Due to the improvement of livestock feeding and management methods, the improvement of breeds, the promotion of new pastoral tools, and the strengthening of animal disease prevention and control, the mortality rate of livestock has gradually decreased, and the birth rate and survival rate have continued to increase. The implementation of settled rotational grazing and the development of diversified operations have brought about a new atmosphere of prosperity for both people and livestock on the grasslands. The total number of livestock in the prefecture has reached 1.25 million head, a net increase of more than 400,000 head compared with before liberation.

    Developing industry is the ideal of the people of all nationalities in the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and this ideal was only realized after liberation. In the past, although there were abundant mineral resources, they could not be developed and utilized. Even simple iron agricultural implements were mostly transported from outside the region.

    After liberation, the Party and the People's Government started industrial construction, enabling various factories and mines to develop from scratch, from few to many. In 1958, industrial construction in the prefecture entered a new upsurge. By the end of 1958, there were more than 1,000 small and medium-sized industrial and mining enterprises in the prefecture, including metallurgy, mining, machinery manufacturing, fuel, electricity, agricultural implements, food processing, leather, and other industrial sectors, producing industrial raw materials such as iron, lead, zinc, gold, coal, mica, and sulfur. In recent years, the main characteristic of industrial development in the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture has been facing the countryside and serving agricultural and pastoral production. Now, not only can small agricultural implements be self-sufficient, but also new agricultural implements such as mountain plows, walking plows, corn threshers, and simple machine tools have been manufactured.

    With the development of industry, the ranks of the working class have also grown and strengthened. At present, there are 1,265 Tibetan and Qiang workers in the prefecture. Not only has the number of minority nationality workers gradually increased, but their skills have also significantly improved.

    "In the first two or three months, the mountains are covered with snow; in the fourth, fifth, and sixth months, the mud covers the feet; in the seventh, eighth, and ninth months, it is good to walk; in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth months, learn to crawl like a dog." These few proverbs vividly describe the inconvenient transportation and difficult roads here before liberation. Before liberation, there was not an inch of highway in the prefecture, and even relatively wide mule tracks were not available. All relied on narrow paths for people to carry on their backs and horses to carry. After liberation, the transportation and transportation industry developed rapidly. The Chengdu-Aba highway, which runs straight through the prefecture for 451 kilometers, took four years and eight months to build and was fully opened to traffic in 1955. This highway is the main artery of the prefecture, opening the long-closed door of transportation for the first time. By 1958, a total of 22 highways had been built in the prefecture, with a total length of 1,768 kilometers. At present, except for Xiaojin and Rangtang counties, all counties in the prefecture have highways, which are closely connected with the highways in neighboring areas.

    In 1958, the transportation and transportation industry also ushered in a great leap forward. By the end of the year, a total of 8,148 kilometers of post roads and cart tracks and 251 large and small bridges had been built in the prefecture. A transportation network centered on highways and extending in all directions is taking shape. River transportation is also beginning.

    Highways have brought benefits to the people of all nationalities. Wherever the highway is built, the prices there will drop, and local specialties will have a broad sales market. Therefore, the people of all nationalities call the highway the "road to happiness."

    The emergence of new cities and market towns is a sign of the gradual prosperity of the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. Along the highways and near forestry and mining mountains, the mountain gullies and grasslands that used to be uninhabited have been built with rows of tall factory buildings and office buildings, turning them into densely populated market towns. Ma'erkang, the capital of the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, used to have only a dilapidated lama temple and a few scattered households on the hillside. After several years of construction, Ma'erkang is about to become a new city like a garden.

    The comprehensive prosperity of economic construction in the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture has enabled the people of all nationalities to get rid of poverty, and their living standards are improving day by day. Simultaneously with the development of economic construction, cultural, educational, and health undertakings are also developing vigorously. The long-cherished desire of the people of all nationalities for national prosperity and strength is becoming a reality.

    The brilliant achievements of economic construction in the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in the nine years since liberation vividly show that only under the leadership of the Party and with the vigorous help of the people of the whole country, especially the Han people, can the people of all nationalities in our country be completely liberated, gradually change their backward outlook, and achieve prosperity and development by carrying out necessary reforms within the nation and taking the democratic and socialist road.

    在社会主义大道上飞跃前进
    中共阿坝藏族自治州委员会委员　顾清庭（藏族）
    从1950年到现在，经过短短九年多的时间，阿坝藏族自治州已发生了极其深刻的变化，由封建初期农奴制社会，进入了社会主义大跃进的历史新时期。
    像其它少数民族地区一样，阿坝藏族自治州以藏族为主的各族人民，首先享受了民族区域自治的权利，过去被压迫的劳动人民，成了国家和自己命运的主人。
    千百年来，沉重地压在各族人民头上的封建农奴制度，是各族人民贫穷与落后的根源。各族人民再不能照老样子生活下去了。中共阿坝州委和阿坝藏族自治州人民委员会，接受了群众的正义要求，根据和平改革的方针，采取自上而下协商和自下而上发动群众相结合的办法，领导了全州的民主改革运动。1954年冬到1956年春，广大农区完成了民主改革，牧业地区的民主改革在1958年也已结束。民主改革取得了伟大胜利，废除了封建土地所有制和一切封建特权，实行农民的土地所有制和牧民的草山牧场集体所有制，解放了奴隶和农奴，从而改变了旧的生产关系，为发展生产铺平了广阔的道路。
    紧接着，广大农牧民在党的指引下，走上了共同富裕的社会主义道路。先后在农区实现了高级合作化和牧区的初级合作化。1958年下半年并在部分地区建立了人民公社。
    在党的建设社会主义的总路线的鼓舞下，在四川省各族人民的支援下，自治州各族人民意气风发，干劲冲天，各项生产建设事业出现了史无前例的大跃进局面。
    为了改变农业生产的落后状况，几年来，党和人民政府领导各族人民进行了许多艰苦细致的工作。发放了大量的农贷、救济和无偿农具，解决农民生产和生活上的困难。大力推广先进技术、新式农具和农药械，兴修水利，增施肥料，防治病虫害。逐步地实行了精耕细作。原始生产工具已成历史遗迹。
    由于农业生产“八字宪法”的全面贯彻，农业生产战线上，高产纪录大量出现，粮食产量急剧增长。如果以1949年粮食产量为一百，1957年即增加为一百七十五。1958年战胜了几年没有过的大旱灾。粮食总产量又比1957年增加50％，等于1949年的206％，改变了自治州粮食长期不能自给的状况。
    几年来，畜牧业生产也有了很大的发展。由于改进牲畜饲养管理方法，改良品种，推广新式牧具，加强畜疫防治工作，牲畜死亡率逐步下降，出生率和成活率不断提高。实行了定居轮牧和开展了多种经营，草原上出现了人畜两旺的新气象。全州的牲畜头数已达一百二十五万头，比解放前净增四十多万头。
    发展工业是阿坝藏族自治州各族人民的理想，这个理想只是在解放后才得以实现。在过去，虽然有着丰富的矿藏资源，但是得不到开发利用，连简单的铁质农具，大部分也都从外区运进。
    解放后党和人民政府就着手工业建设，使各种厂矿企业从无到有，由少到多的发展起来。1958年，全州工业建设进入了新的高潮。到1958年底，全州已有中小型工矿企业一千多个，包括冶炼、采矿、机械制造、燃料、电力、农具、食品加工、皮革等各个工业部门，生产了铁、铅、锌、黄金、煤炭和云母、硫磺等工业原料。几年来，阿坝藏族自治州工业发展的主要特点是面向农村，为农牧业生产服务。如今不仅小型农具可以自用有余，而且制成了山犁、步犁、玉麦脱粒等新式农具和简易机床。
    随着工业的发展，工人阶级的队伍也成长壮大起来。目前全州已有藏羌族工人一千二百六十五人。少数民族工人不仅在数量上逐渐增多，在技术上也有了显著提高。
      “正二三，雪封山；四五六，泥没脚；七八九，正好走；十冬腊，学狗爬”这几句谚语生动地描写了解放前这里交通不便，道路难行的情景。解放前，全州没有一寸公路，连比较宽敞的骡道也没有，全靠羊肠小道人背马驮。解放后，交通运输事业得到迅速发展。直贯全州长四百五十一公里的成（都）阿（坝）公路，修了四年零八个月，于1955年全线通车。这条公路是全州的大动脉，第一次打开了交通长期闭塞的大门。到1958年全州先后共修筑公路二十二条，长一千七百六十八公里。目前除小金、壤塘两个县以外，全州县县都有公路，并且和邻近地区的公路紧密相联。
    1958年，交通运输事业也来了个大跃进。到年底，全州共修建驿道和大车道八千一百四十八公里，大小桥梁二百五十一座。一个以公路为中心的四通八达的交通运输网正在形成。利用河流运输也在开始。
    公路给各族人民带来了好处。公路修到那里，那里的物价就会降低，土特产品就有了广阔的销路。因此，各族人民把公路称为“幸福之路”。
    新的城市和集镇的出现，是阿坝藏族自治州逐步繁荣起来的标志。在公路沿线、林业矿山的附近，过去曾经是荒无人烟的山沟草原，一排排高大的厂房和办公大楼修建起来，变成了人口稠密的集镇。阿坝藏族自治州首府所在地——马尔康，以前就只有一座破旧的喇嘛寺和半山上稀稀落落的几户人家。经过几年的建设，马尔康即将成为像花园一样的新城市。
    阿坝藏族自治州经济建设的全面繁荣，使各族人民摆脱了穷困的处境，生活水平蒸蒸日上。与经济建设发展的同时，文教卫生事业也蓬蓬勃勃地向前发展。各族人民长期梦寐以求的民族繁荣昌盛的愿望，正在变成现实。
    阿坝藏族自治州解放后九年多来经济建设的辉煌成就，具体生动地显示了，只有在党的领导和全国人民特别是汉族人民的大力帮助下，在民族内部进行必要的改革，走民主和社会主义道路，我国各族人民才能彻底解放，逐步改变落后面貌，得到繁荣发展。
