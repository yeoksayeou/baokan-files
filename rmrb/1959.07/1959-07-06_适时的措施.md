    Timely Measures
    Anhui Province's recent comprehensive arrangement for pig iron production has a characteristic: it does not generally make demands on quality and quantity in terms of figures, but rather takes some solid and practical measures in a timely manner. If the measures are implemented, the requirements for quality, quantity, and variety will not be difficult to achieve.
    Anhui's measures mainly include three items. First, pig iron should be produced according to designated varieties. Second, mines, coke plants, and refractory material plants should, in principle, be led by steel plants. Third, ore, coke, refractory materials, and pig iron should be priced according to quality, with higher prices for higher quality.
    These measures have great benefits. Pig iron has different varieties due to different components such as sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon. The needs for pig iron are also different due to different production purposes such as steelmaking and iron casting. Production according to specified varieties means producing the type of pig iron that is needed. The production of pig iron should follow the needs of steelmaking and iron casting, and steelmaking and iron casting should not follow the pig iron. Only in this way can steel production avoid being passive and maintain the initiative.
    Having steel plants lead mines, coke plants, and refractory material plants is also aimed at better resolving the relationship between supply and demand. Having steel plants lead mines, coke plants, and refractory material plants, and directing the production of raw materials according to needs, is obviously more planned than having mines and other units produce independently.
    Higher prices for higher quality is a positive way to improve quality. It will have a positive promoting effect on strengthening the economic accounting and management of factories, and improving operating techniques.
    Perhaps some will ask: Since these measures have so many benefits, why didn't Anhui implement these measures earlier? The answer is that it was not appropriate too early, now is the right time. Because any measure needs certain conditions as a basis. For example, production according to specified varieties is not something that can be done just by wanting to do it; it must be done after mastering certain technologies. Since Anhui Province vigorously developed steel production last year, the steel contingent has gradually grown and accumulated certain experiences, especially after the Anhui Provincial Party Committee's steel plant successfully used small blast furnaces to produce high-quality pig iron that could be used in alkaline converters to produce good steel, summarizing a set of technical operation, raw material management, and testing experience, which provided the basic conditions for ironmaking according to specified varieties. Being too hasty may not be effective. Things are constantly developing. Pay attention to the development of things at any time, and propose measures in a timely manner according to changes in conditions to promote the advancement of work. This is a practical and effective working method.
    The measures proposed by Anhui to improve the quality and output of pig iron may not be suitable for all regions, but this working method is suitable for all work and all places.

### 适时的措施

    适时的措施
    安徽省最近全面安排生铁生产有一个特点：不是一般地从数字上对质量、数量提出要求，而是及时地采取了一些扎扎实实的措施。措施实现了，质量、数量、品种的要求就不难达到了。
    安徽的措施，主要有三项。第一，生铁要按指定品种进行生产；第二，矿山、焦厂、耐火材料厂原则上归钢铁厂领导；第三，矿石、焦炭、耐火材料、生铁，按质论价，优质优价。
    这些措施，好处很大。生铁由于含硫、磷、矽等成份的不同，品种也不同；由于炼钢、铸铁等的生产目的不同，对生铁的需要也不同。按规定品种生产，也就是需要甚么样的生铁，就生产甚么样的生铁。生铁的生产应该跟着炼钢、铸铁的需要走，而不能让炼钢、铸铁跟着生铁走。只有这样，钢铁的生产才能避免被动，稳操主动。
    矿山、焦厂、耐火材料厂归钢铁厂领导，目的也是为了更好地解决供应和需要的关系。由钢铁厂领导矿山、焦厂、耐火材料厂，按照需要指挥原材料的生产，这比矿山等单位独立生产，显然会更有计划些。
    优质优价，这是提高质量的一个积极办法。对加强工厂的经济核算、经营管理，提高操作技术等等，都会发生积极的推动作用。
    也许有人会问：既然这几项措施有这样多的好处，安徽为甚么不早早实行这些措施？答复是过早了不行，现在正适时。因为任何措施，都需要一定的条件作依据。比如说，按指定品种进行生产，这就不是想做到就能做到的，必须在掌握了一定的技术以后才能办到。安徽省从去年大办钢铁以来，钢铁队伍逐渐成长起来，已经积累起一定的经验，特别是安徽省委机关钢铁厂试用小高炉炼出能供碱性转炉炼好钢的优质生铁以后，总结了一套技术操作、原料管理和化验的经验，这就具备了按指定品种炼铁的基本条件。操之过急，未必有效。事物是不断发展的。随时注意事物的发展状况，根据条件的变化，及时提出措施，推动工作前进，这是一种切合实际的有效的工作方法。
    安徽提出的提高生铁质量、产量的几项措施，虽然不一定适合所有的地区，但是这种工作方法，却是适合一切工作，一切地方的。
