The Way of Calculation
Zhuang Nong

Reading "Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division" (People's Daily, July 3rd, page 8) gave me considerable inspiration. Human life is inseparable from mathematics, but addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division cannot be applied equally to all aspects. Because whether in production or consumption, there are unique characteristics to their calculations.

First, let's talk about the calculation characteristics of production. Generally, it's done with addition. For example, how much production has increased, that's addition. Generally speaking, from the perspective of total output value, production is rarely able to grow exponentially. China's Great Leap Forward last year was unprecedented. Steel doubled, and grain also doubled. However, it was only a multiplication by 2, and in reality, it was still just one plus one equals two. The production of individual items can sometimes be calculated using multiplication. For example, a certain tool underwent a revolution, so the production of this tool can increase exponentially. Subtraction can also occur in production. For example, when productive forces are damaged due to obstacles in production relations, production declines. This is what we see in capitalist economic crises. Grain production will also decrease when encountering exceptionally severe natural disasters that human power cannot resist, and this is also subtraction. However, these do not prevent the general law that production always uses addition.

Let's talk about the calculation rules of consumption. Consumption here refers to the distribution of the fruits of production, mainly using division. We often see statistics like this: in a certain country, calculated per capita: steel is so much; grain is so much; cloth is so much... This is division. The rule of this division is that the larger the dividend (i.e., total production value) and the smaller the divisor (i.e., population), then the larger the quotient (i.e., per capita average). Conversely, the smaller it is. This is common sense and doesn't need much explanation.

Let's talk more about the calculation characteristics of our China.

Our characteristics are poverty and blankness, and a large population. Poverty (economic backwardness) and blankness (cultural and technological backwardness), these are the small base numbers we use for calculations. A large population is a large divisor.

As a result, when calculating with addition, because the base number is too small, although much is added, the total is still not large, and even if it reaches multiplication (doubling), the total is still not much. We say that we are now living well, which is compared to our past. It has increased by nearly double. Compared to before, isn't this rich? Of course, it's rich. But how does it compare to other countries? Many countries have much larger base numbers than us, so they are much richer than us.

When calculating with division, because the dividend is small and the divisor is large, the quotient is very small. Think about it, last year so much steel and so much grain increased, but averaged among more than six hundred million people, how much can it be? Calculating it this way, we cannot think we are wealthy, and therefore, we cannot live like the wealthy.

Does this mean our situation is very pessimistic? A small base number and a large divisor are unfavorable conditions. What should we do?

No, we should be optimistic, because we have good methods. For example, a large divisor is an unfavorable situation, but transforming the divisor into a multiplier is a very favorable situation. From the perspective of production, each of us can think of more ways to perform the addition calculation better, so that production increases more. If one person adds a little, then more than six hundred million people adding a little is more than six hundred million little points. Adding ten little points is more than sixty billion little points. Isn't this very beneficial? Each of us can also individually engage in a little multiplication, such as reforming tools and innovating production, so that the production under our hands can increase exponentially. Many hands make light work. Isn't this also very beneficial? This is called increasing production.

From the perspective of consumption, we can first do a subtraction. Subtraction doesn't mean lowering living standards. That's arithmetic that capitalist countries like, and we don't perform that kind of calculation. As production develops, living standards should increase accordingly. But subtraction should still exist: that is, subtracting the part that is wasteful or can be saved, and then multiplying, which is considerable. For example, savings. If each person saves an average of one yuan per month, that's more than six hundred million yuan. Ten yuan is more than sixty billion yuan. Isn't this remarkable? This is just talking about savings in consumption. If we were to calculate savings in production, it would be even more considerable.

Therefore, I am reminded that although the losses from the floods in Guangdong this year are large, they are not actually terrible, because it is just a kind of subtraction. What was taken away, we can still get back. And the waste in people's daily lives, although small, is terrible, because it is multiplication. First multiplied by 600 million plus, then multiplied by 365. Imperceptibly, the losses in a year must be much more than what the floods in Guangdong took away. This is also why we must vigorously practice thrift.

In short, the divisor can be transformed into a multiplier, and subtraction is beneficial to addition. With six hundred and fifty million diligent people, as long as we are proficient in the way of calculation, the future beauty will surely be a sea of wealth and a mountain of riches.

    运算之道
    庄农
    读了“加减乘除”（7月3日人民日报八版），得到不小启发。人类生活是离不开数学的，但加减乘除却不能并用于各个方面。因为无论生产或者消费方面，都有它的运算特点。
    先说生产方面的运算特点。一般都是用加法演算。比方生产增加了多少，这就是加法。一般情况下，从总产值来说，生产是很难有成倍的增长的。中国去年是空前的大跃进，钢加了一番，粮食也加了一番，但是，也仅够一个乘2的乘法，实际上也还不过是一加一等于二。个别物品的生产，有时会用乘法演算。比如某种工具进行了革命，于是这种生产便能成倍数的增加。生产上有时也能出现减法，比如生产力因受到生产关系的障碍而遭受破坏时生产便下降，这就是我们看到的资本主义经济危机；粮食的生产，遇到特大的人力不能抵御的天灾，也会减产，这也是减法。但是，这些都不妨碍，在一般情况下，生产总是用加法运算的规律。
    再说消费方面的运算规律。这里的消费是指的生产果实的分配，主要是用除法演算。我们常常看到这样的统计，某某国家，按人口平均计算：钢是多少；粮食是多少；布是多少……这便是除法。这种除法的规律是被除数（即生产总值）越大，除数（即人口）越小，那末，商数（即按人口平均数）越大。相反，便越小。这是常识，不用多说的了。
    我们还是多谈一谈我们中国的运算特点吧。
    我们的特点是一穷二白，人口众多。一穷（经济落后）二白（文化技术落后），这就是我们作为运算用的那个基数太小；人口众多是被除数太大。
    这样一来，算加法，由于基数太小，虽然加了很多，但总数仍不算多，甚至够上了乘法（加倍了），总数还是不多；我们说我们现在是富日子，那是同自己过去比较说的，增加了近一倍，比起从前来这还不富吗？当然富。但是同别的国家比又怎么样呢？有许多国家基数要比我们大的多，所以，也就比我们富的多。
    算除法，由于被除数小，除数大，因此商数就很小。想想看，去年增加了那么多钢，那么多粮，但平均在六亿多人身上，能够合多少？这样一算，我们就不能认为我们是富家翁，因此，也就不能用富家翁的方法去过日子。
    这样说来，我们的情况不是很令人悲观的吗？基数小，除数大的情况，是一种不利的情况，该怎么办呢？
    不，我们应该乐观，因为我们有好办法。比如除数大，这是个不利情况，但把除数转化为乘数，这就是个大有利的情况。从生产上看，我们每个人都可以多想点办法，把加法运算得更好些，使生产多加一些，一个人加一点，六亿多人就是六亿多点，加十点就是六十多亿点，这不是很有利吗？我们每个人还可以个别的弄一点小乘法，比如改革工具，生产革新，使自己手下的生产能来个成倍的增长，众人拾柴火焰高，这也是很有利的吧。这就叫增产。
    从消费上看，我们可以先来个减法；减法，不是说要降低生活水平，那是资本主义国家里喜欢的算术，而我们是不演那样的算题的。生产发展了，生活应该相应的提高。但是减法还应该有：那就是把属于浪费的或是可以节约的那一部分减下来，然后一乘，这就是很可观了。比如储蓄，每人每月平均一元，就是六亿多元，十元，就是六十多亿元，这不是很了不起吗？这就叫节约。这只是说的消费方面的节约，如果要算生产方面的节约，那就更是可观的了。
    因此，我联想到：广东今年水灾的损失虽大，其实并不可怕，因为它只不过是一种减法，夺走了的我们还能拿回来。而人们日常生活中的浪费虽小，倒是可怕的，因为它是乘法，先乘以6亿多，再乘以365，无形之中，一年来的损耗，一定要比广东洪水夺走的要多得多。这也是我们必须厉行节约的原因吧。
    总之，除数可以转化为乘数，减法又有利于加法。有了六亿五千多万勤劳的人民，只要我们精通算道，未来的美景一定会是财源似海富贵如山的。
