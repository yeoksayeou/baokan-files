Technological Innovation Improves Equipment: Saving 880,000 Tons of Coal in Seven Years
Jixi Power Plant Generates More Electricity with Less Coal

    (Our newspaper, Harbin, 30th dispatch) The Jixi Power Plant in Heilongjiang Province has saved 880,000 tons of raw coal for the country in the past seven years while completing its power generation plan.
    The fuel used by this plant in the past was entirely high-quality Hengshan raw coal. Beginning in the winter of 1952, due to the needs of national industrial construction, the plant's Party organization called on its workers to carry out activities to save coal. Then, based on workers' suggestions, they encouraged all workers to try burning low-quality coal. At the same time, the Party committee also focused on cultivating skilled workers in burning low-quality coal – furnace operator Mo Chengbin – promptly summarizing his advanced experience and organizing on-site demonstrations and technical performances. After that, burning low-quality coal was incorporated into technical indicators, and a competition to save coal was launched among various shifts throughout the plant.
    In the continuous coal-saving competition over the past few years, in order to overcome the technical difficulties of burning low-quality coal with its low volatile content, low calorific value, low boiler temperature, and failure to meet output standards, the plant established a technical research group, constantly conducting technical research, gradually changing operating methods, and formulating a set of technical measures for burning low-quality coal. For example, in the past, when burning high-quality coal, increasing boiler steam pressure meant sending air first, then coal. After burning low-quality coal, this was changed to sending coal first, then air when increasing pressure, and reducing coal first, then air when decreasing pressure. This solved the problem of extinguishing the fire easily when increasing or decreasing boiler steam pressure due to the low volatile content of low-quality coal. At the same time, in operation, they also increased the output of some auxiliary equipment of the boiler by 5% to more than double, based on the contradiction between the large amount of coal burned and the small actual throughput capacity when using low-quality coal for power generation. This increased the boiler's coal feeding, air feeding, and smoke exhaust capacity, resolving the contradiction between the large amount of coal used and the small boiler throughput capacity.
    In order to persist in burning low-quality coal, the plant also carried out 22 reforms on power generation equipment based on the characteristics of combustion. In order to increase the boiler steam temperature, they added two rows of superheater tubes in the boiler, changed the past saturated steam soot blowing to superheated steam soot blowing, and also improved the fire barrier equipment, etc., so that the boiler could adapt to the needs of burning low-quality coal. After burning low-quality coal, not only did the boiler output not decrease, but the boiler's hourly output increased by three tons. Therefore, this plant has burned a total of eight kinds of low-quality coal in the past seven years. In particular, since 1957, it has completely stopped burning high-quality coal and switched entirely to using Didào No. 2 washed coal that cannot be burned by general industry (this coal is low-value coal left over after two water washings by the washing plant). With the continuous increase in the plant's power generation capacity, last year, under the condition of insufficient supply of Didào No. 2 coal, they further mixed in 25% to 40% of Didào No. 3 gangue discarded after three water washings by the Didào washing plant.
    Although this plant has persisted in not burning high-quality coal for a long time, the entire plant does not give up saving even a tiny bit of low-quality coal, carefully calculating everywhere and never wasting a piece of coal. The workers often clean the area near the boiler spotlessly. In order to make the coal burn fully, achieve less coal burning, and generate more electricity, they also launched a small indicator competition among the shifts to see who discharged ash with a small carbon content and low smoke exhaust temperature, and promoted the "add less, add frequently" coal-saving method. In addition to boiler workers, general workers throughout the plant also tried every means to save coal. Loading and unloading workers always cleaned up the coal yard neatly after each unloading.
    This plant's long-term adherence to burning low-quality coal and saving coal has achieved great economic results and promoted the improvement of enterprise management. According to calculations, from 1952 to the present, this plant has saved more than 880,000 tons of raw coal for the country, and the cost has gradually decreased. The standard coal consumption per kilowatt-hour has decreased from 584 grams in 1958 to the current 567 grams, and the fuel cost of producing every thousand kilowatt-hours of electricity has also decreased from 10 yuan 9 jiao 2 fen before burning low-quality coal to 6 yuan 8 jiao 1 fen. The plant's power generation capacity has also been at full load for several years, especially since the Great Leap Forward last year, it has been operating above its output, generating an extra 10 million kilowatt-hours for the country in the first half of this year alone.

    革新技术改进设备　七年省煤八十八万吨
    鸡西电厂用煤少发电多
    本报哈尔滨30日电　黑龙江省鸡西发电厂七年来在完成发电计划的同时，为国家节约原煤八十八万吨。
    这个厂以前所使用的燃料，完全是质量好的恒山原煤。从1952年冬天开始，由于国家工业建设的需要，这个厂的党组织就号召职工开展节约煤炭的活动。进而又根据工人建议，鼓励全体工人试烧劣质煤。与此同时，党委又有重点地培养了烧劣质煤的能手——司炉莫城彬，及时总结了他的先进经验，组织现场观摩和技术表演。此后就把烧劣煤纳入了技术指标，号召全厂各班之间开展节约用煤的竞赛。
    几年来在持续不断的省煤竞赛中，工人们为了突破燃烧劣质煤挥发分不高、热量小、锅炉温度低、达不到出力标准的技术关，全厂成立了技术研究小组，不断地进行技术研究，逐步改变操作方法，并制订出一套烧劣质煤的技术措施。如过去烧好煤时，增加锅炉汽压是先送风，后送煤。燃烧劣煤以后，就改变为增压先送煤，后送风，减压时，先减煤，后减风。这样就解决了因劣煤挥发分小，在锅炉增减汽压时，容易灭火的难题。同时在操作上，他们还根据用劣煤发电，锅炉燃煤量大和实际吞吐能力小的矛盾，把锅炉的一些附属设备的出力，都加大了5％到一倍以上。这样就加大了锅炉的进煤、进风和排烟的能力，解决了用煤量大和锅炉吞吐能力小的矛盾。
    为了坚持烧劣质煤，这个厂还根据燃烧的特点，对发电设备进行了二十二项改革。为了提高锅炉蒸汽温度，他们在锅炉里增加了两排过热管，将过去饱和蒸汽吹灰，改成了过热蒸汽吹灰，还改进了挡火设备等，使锅炉适应烧劣质煤的需要。烧劣质煤以后，不仅没有降低锅炉出力，反而使锅炉每小时的出力增加了三吨。因此，这个厂七年来先后共烧过八种劣煤，特别是从1957年开始就完全不烧好煤，全部改用了一般工业所不能燃用的滴道二号水洗煤（这种煤是水洗厂经过两次水洗以后剩下的低值煤）。随着这个厂发电能力的不断增加，去年在滴道二号煤供应不足的条件下，他们又进一步掺用了25％到40％的滴道水洗厂经过三次水洗以后废弃的滴道三号矸石。
    这个厂几年来虽然一直坚持不烧好煤，但全厂对一点一滴的劣煤也不放弃节约，处处精打细算，从不浪费一块煤炭。工人们经常是把锅炉附近打扫得干干净净，为了使煤炭能充分燃烧，做到少烧煤，多发电，还在各班之间开展了看谁排出的灰渣中含炭量小、排烟温度低的小指标竞赛，推行了“少添、勤添”的节煤方法。全厂除锅炉工外，一般工人也千方百计节约用煤。装卸工人在每次卸完煤以后，总是把煤场收拾得干净利索。
    这个厂长期坚持烧劣煤、节约用煤，取得了巨大的经济效果，并且推动了企业管理的改善。据计算，从1952年到现在这个厂共为国家节约了八十八万多吨原煤，而且成本逐渐下降。每度电的标准耗煤量从1958年的五百八十四克降低到目前的五百六十七克，生产每千度电的燃料成本也从烧劣煤前的十元九角二分，降低到六元八角一分。全厂发电能力几年来也一直达到了满负荷，特别是从去年大跃进以来，还一直超出力运行，仅今年上半年就为国家多发电一千万度。
