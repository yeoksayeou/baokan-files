Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou: The more than 210,000 mu of early rice in Longxi County, Fujian Province, has been basically harvested. During the rush harvest, thanks to the various methods adopted by the broad masses of commune members to prevent rain and wind, carefully thresh and collect, and reduce losses and scattering, the county reaped an additional four million jin of rice.

During the early rice harvest in Longxi County, it was the rainy season. In order to prevent damage from rain, all communes and production teams planned and arranged labor, adopting methods such as harvesting the ripe rice first, and harvesting fallen fields, low-lying fields, fields near doorways, and fields exposed to the wind first, in order to rush the harvest in a timely manner. Before the arrival of two rainstorms, the county organized more than 70,000 laborers and rushed to harvest more than 20,000 mu of low-lying paddy fields that were likely to be flooded and rice that was basically ripe, reducing the loss of about one million jin of rice.

During the rush harvest, all communes and production teams reasonably divided labor according to the strengths of the commune members, ensuring that cutting, threshing, transporting, and drying were all the responsibility of specific personnel. At the same time, the practice of light cutting and light placement, cutting with the wind, and using rice seedling boats and large wooden basins to hold the cut rice stalks was widely implemented. Methods such as adding enclosures to threshing barrels and adding mats to the ground were used to avoid placing rice stalks on the ground and losing grains during threshing, greatly reducing losses. After adopting these methods, Tianbao Commune's more than 21,000 mu of early rice yielded an average of about fifteen jin more rice per mu.

Many commune production teams also planned and arranged labor to re-thresh the threshed rice straw. After re-threshing more than 2,800 mu of early rice in Guxian Brigade of Yan厝 Commune, a total of more than 30,000 jin of rice was collected. All production teams in Zini Commune used threshing machines to thresh the japonica rice that was more difficult to thresh and carried out a second re-threshing, which also yielded more than 56,000 jin of rice.

    巧防风雨  细打细收
    龙溪多收稻谷四百万斤
    据新华社福州讯　福建省龙溪县二十一万多亩早稻已经基本收完。在抢收中，由于广大社员采取多种办法防雨防风，精打细收，减少损失和抛撒，全县因此约多收了稻谷四百多万斤。
    龙溪县早稻收获期间，正是雨季。为了防止雨害，各公社生产队都有计划地安排劳力，采取先熟先割和先割倒伏田、低洼田、门口田、风头田等办法，及时抢收抢割。在两次暴雨到来前，全县共组织了七万多个劳动力，及时抢收了两万多亩可能受淹的低水田和已经基本黄熟的稻子，约减少损失稻谷一百万斤左右。
    在抢收中，各公社生产队都根据社员的特长合理分工，作到割、打、运、晒都有专人负责。同时，普遍实行轻割轻放，顺风割，用插秧船、大木盆盛放割下的稻禾。在打谷桶上加围、地上加垫等办法，避免稻禾放在地上和打谷时丢粒，减少了很多损失。天宝公社在采用这些办法以后，二万一千多亩早稻，每亩平均约多收稻谷十五斤。
    许多公社的生产队还有计划地安排劳力，对已打过的稻草进行复打。颜厝公社古县大队二千八百多亩早稻，进行复打以后，共计多收稻谷三万多斤。紫泥公社各生产队对较难脱粒的粳稻都用打谷机打谷和进行第二次复打，也多收稻谷五万六千多斤。
