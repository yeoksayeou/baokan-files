    Hoping Literary Historians Collectively Write Books
    In our studies, due to the lack of a good modern literary history and lecture notes, we have to piece things together from various sources and look everywhere. This is the case for students and teachers alike. This, to a certain extent, affects the quality of teaching.
    The best way to solve this problem, I think, is to leverage the collective power of literary historians to write a book that is rich in content and strong in both ideology and scientific rigor. Currently, schools are compiling their own lecture notes, but due to limited manpower and expertise, the quality is difficult to guarantee. Some say that literary historians have different opinions, making it difficult to collectively write a book. I believe that disagreements can be discussed and unified, and some issues can be resolved separately through the "Hundred Schools of Thought" approach, which does not affect the collective writing of a book based on the majority's opinion. Just as there are many debates in the economics field, it does not prevent the collective writing of "Political Economy Textbook."
    I hope that relevant departments can study this issue and find a way to resolve it.

    希望文学史家们集体编书
    在我们学习中，由于没有一部很好的现代文学史和讲义，不能不东拼西凑，到处翻阅。学生如此，教师也如此。这样，就在一定程度上影响了教学质量。
    解决这一问题的办法，我觉得最好是发挥文学史家的集体的力量，编写出一本内容充实、思想性科学性都强的书来。现在各学校都在编自己的讲义，但限于人力与水平，质量就很难保证。有人说，文学史家的各人见解不同，不好集体编书。我认为意见不一致可以讨论统一，有些问题可以在百家争鸣中另外解决，并不影响根据多数意见集体编书。正如经济学界有许多争论，并不妨碍集体编写“政治经济学教科书”一样。
    希望有关部门能研究这一问题，想办法予以解决。
