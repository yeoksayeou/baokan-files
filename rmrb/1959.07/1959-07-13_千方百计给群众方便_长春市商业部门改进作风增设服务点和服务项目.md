    Trying Every Possible Way to Make Things Convenient for the Masses
    Changchun City Commercial Departments Improve Work Style by Adding Service Points and Service Projects
    (Our newspaper Changchun, July 11th) Changchun City commercial departments are actively adjusting commercial networks, adding service projects, and improving their service style to open doors of convenience for residents.
    Since May, Changchun City has established People's Economic Life Committees from top to bottom, specifically to study and improve the people's economic life. Each district, based on the spirit of convenience for the masses, has actively formulated plans to adjust commercial networks, striving to increase service points and service projects. Now, not only have industries such as catering, barbering, and clothing processing increased in Changchun City, but many new types of service stations and shops have appeared in various urban areas and streets to meet the needs of the masses. According to statistics from Nanguan District alone, more than 500 service points for food processing, old goods repair, and non-staple food supply have been newly built recently. The "We Take Care of What No One Else Does" (不管部) established on Dongguang Street in Kuancheng District, solves all kinds of difficulties for the masses, from weddings and funerals to daily purchases of firewood, rice, oil, and salt. Since its opening, it has been crowded with customers day and night. According to statistics, within four days of its establishment, more than forty households registered to find someone to whitewash their walls. Each neighborhood committee in Chaoyang District has set up vegetable plots, and the number of vegetable supply points in the district has increased more than threefold compared to the past, greatly benefiting residents.
    "Everything starts from the convenience of the masses" has become the slogan for the actions of employees in the Changchun City commercial system. Recently, all-night sales halls and night sales windows have spread throughout the major streets of Changchun City. Many stores not only adjusted their business hours according to specific circumstances, changing the past practice of stores opening when offices and factories start work and closing when offices and factories end work, but also developed services such as door-to-door delivery, mobile sales, and door-to-door barbering to facilitate the masses. The non-staple food stores in Chaoyang District implemented a "three guarantees" (guaranteed purchase, guaranteed delivery, and guaranteed exchange) sales method for sick, elderly, and disabled customers, which has been widely praised by residents. Changchun City bathhouses have recently manufactured a simple and easy-to-use mobile bath car, suitable for people in rural areas, construction sites, and other places without bathhouse facilities, which is very popular among the masses.
    Many stores in Changchun City have also developed a trend of "one person, multiple skills" and accepting old items for recycling. The Dongguang Street Non-Staple Food Comprehensive Store has ten salespersons who have learned to cut hair and have set up an experimental barber shop. They are training barbers for the streets and factories without hindering the store's business. According to recent statistics, they have found time to cut hair for more than 700 people in the nearby community. Changchun City's Sixth Department Store has added services such as collecting industrial raw materials on behalf of customers, installing accessories for customers, and selling used goods on behalf of customers, which not only facilitates the masses but also increases the store's supply of goods.
    In addition, Changchun City has also planned to restore and establish some small street markets, adding a lot of convenience to the daily life of the masses in many ways.

    千方百计给群众方便
    长春市商业部门改进作风增设服务点和服务项目
    本报长春11日电　长春市商业部门积极调整商业网点，增设服务项目，改进服务作风，为居民大开方便之门。
    长春市自5月份以来，就自上而下的建立了组织人民经济生活委员会，专门研究改善人民经济生活问题。各区普遍本着便利群众需要的精神，积极制订调整商业网点规划，千方百计的增加服务点和服务项目。现在，长春市不仅饮食、理发、服装加工等行业较前增加，各市区、街道还出现了许许多多方面满足群众需要的新型的服务站、店。仅据南关区的统计，最近就新建了食品加工、旧物修理、副食供应等五百多个服务点。宽城区东广街建立的不管部（人家不管的它管），从群众婚丧嫁娶到日常购买柴米油盐等大小事务中的疑难都代为解决，自开业以来，朝夕顾客盈门。据统计，在成立后的四天之内，仅登记找人粉刷墙壁的就有四十多户。朝阳区每个居民委员会都设立了菜床，全区的蔬菜供应点比过去增加了三倍多，居民大为称便。
    一切从方便群众出发，已成为长春市商业系统职工的行动口号。最近以来，通宵售货厅、夜间售货窗，遍布了长春市的各个主要街道。许多商店不仅根据具体情况，调整了营业时间，改变了过去机关、工厂上班商店开门，机关、工厂下班商店闭店的营业作风，还酌情开展了送货到门、流动售货、登门理发等服务项目，以便利广大群众。朝阳区各副食品商店，对病老伤残顾客实行了“三包”（包买、包送、包调换）售货法，深受广大居民称赞。长春市浴池，最近制造一种简便易行的流动浴车，适合农村、工地等没有浴池设施地方的人们需要，很受群众欢迎。
    长春市许多商店还形成一人多艺和代收旧物的风气。东广街副食品综合商店，已有十个营业员学会理发，附设了一个实验理发部，正在不妨碍商店营业的前提下为街道、工厂培训理发员。据最近统计，他们已经抽空给附近群众理发七百多人次。长春市第六百货商店，增加了代收工业原材料、代顾客安装配件、代售旧货等服务项目，既便利了群众，又增加了商店的货源。
    此外，长春市还有计划地恢复和建立了一些街巷小市场，从多方面给群众日常生活增加很多方便。
