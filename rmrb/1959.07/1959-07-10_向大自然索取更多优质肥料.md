In the struggle to strive for the continued great leap forward in agricultural production, the fertilizer problem is becoming increasingly important. People have created many methods and experiences for accumulating and producing fertilizer in order to obtain more and better fertilizer. The news published in today's newspaper about the Xiangzhi Commune in Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, establishing fertilizer bases in five aspects, provides effective experience for accumulating and producing large amounts of fertilizer year after year.

The practice of Xiangzhi Commune in establishing fertilizer bases has many noteworthy features. For example, they regard the work of accumulating and producing fertilizer as a basic construction and fundamental measure in agricultural production increase, and widely mobilize the masses to make all commune members participate in this work, so that they can quickly establish five aspects of year-round fertilizer accumulation and production bases without spending much labor and capital. This approach can greatly improve the efficiency of fertilizer accumulation and greatly improve the quality of fertilizer. Up to now, the refined fertilizers such as human and animal manure, barnyard manure, green manure, sea fertilizer, and soil fertilizer provided by these fertilizer bases have accounted for 70% of the commune's farmland fertilizer needs, so that the amount of fertilizer applied to farmland in the commune this year has increased by 20% to 50% compared with last year. For another example, they not only attach importance to the establishment of bases for accumulating human and animal manure and soil fertilizer production bases, but also resolutely change the past habit of "only collecting without planting, only fishing without raising," and closely combine planting, raising, and collecting. This approach is very necessary. It is one of the most effective ways to extract more fertilizer from nature. Nature is very rich. It provides people with all the resources for production and life, and also provides abundant resources for accumulating and producing fertilizer. However, only through people's hard work, being good at developing, utilizing, and cultivating these resources, can nature's gift to people be unlimited, inexhaustible, and inexhaustible. The comrades of Xiangzhi Commune understand this principle. They not only earnestly and vigorously engage in the methods of accumulating and producing fertilizer that have long been effective—such as vigorously developing livestock and poultry, and expanding the planting area of green manure—but also systematically select a batch of high-quality, high-yield varieties from thousands of wild plants that can be comprehensively used (such as as feed, raw materials for light industry, etc.), change to artificial cultivation methods, establish new fertilizer bases, and produce large quantities. This approach, from the current point of view, can greatly save the labor of collecting fertilizer, and second, it can obtain a large amount of high-quality fertilizer, so as to further meet the needs of crops and ensure a greater agricultural harvest. From a long-term perspective, because a solid and reliable fertilizer base has been established, it has created conditions for obtaining a large amount of fertilizer in the future. As long as it is adhered to and continues to develop, in coordination with the increasing development of the national chemical fertilizer industry, the fertilizer problem can be fundamentally and gradually solved, and the faster development of agricultural production can be promoted.

    向大自然索取更多优质肥料
    陈启桐
    在争取农业生产继续大跃进的斗争中，肥料问题是越来越重要了。人们为了取得更多更好的肥料，创造了很多积肥造肥的方法和经验。今天本报发表的福建省晋江县祥芝公社从五方面建立肥料基地的消息，又提供了常年大量积肥造肥的有效经验。
    祥芝公社建立肥料基地的作法有很多值得重视的特点。譬如他们把积造肥料工作当作农业增产中的一种基本建设和根本措施，广泛地发动群众，使社员人人参加这个工作，从而不用花多大劳力和资金，就很快地建立了五个方面的常年积造肥料的基地。这样作既可大大提高积肥效率，又可大大改进肥料质量。到目前止，由这些肥料基地提供的人粪尿、厩肥、绿肥、海肥和土化肥等精肥，已占全社田地需肥量70％，使今年全社农田施肥量比去年增加二成到五成。再如，他们不但重视建立积聚人畜粪尿的基地和土化肥生产基地，同时还坚决地改变了过去“光采不种、光捞不养”的习惯，把种养和采积密切结合起来。这一作法十分必要，这是向大自然索取更多肥料的一种最有效的办法。大自然是十分丰饶的，它为人们提供了一切生产和生活的资源，也提供了丰富的积肥造肥的资源。但是，只有经过人们的辛勤劳动，善于开辟、利用和培养这些资源，大自然对人们的赐予才是无限的，取之不尽、用之不竭的。祥芝公社的同志们懂得这个道理，他们不仅把早已行之有效的积造肥料的方法——如大量发展家畜、家禽，扩大绿肥的播种面积等认真地大力地搞起来，而且从千百种野生植物中，有计划地选择了一批质量高、产量大、又可综合使用（如当饲料、轻工业原料等）的品种，改用人工培植的办法，建立新的肥料基地，大量产制。这种作法，从当前来说，一可以大大节省采积肥料的劳力，二可以获得大量的优质肥料，从而进一步满足农作物的需要，保证农业更大丰收。从长远来看，因为建立了坚实可靠的肥料基地，就为今后源源取得大量肥料创造了条件，只要坚持下去并继续发展，在国家化学肥料工业日益发展的配合下，就可以从根本上逐步解决肥料问题，促进农业生产的更快发展。
