    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 30th (TASS): The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which closed on June 29th, passed an appeal to workers, collective farmers, Soviet intellectuals, and all working people of the Soviet Union, calling on the people of the whole country to launch a nationwide socialist competition for the early completion of the Seven-Year Plan and for technical innovation.

    The Plenary Session called on the working people to fight for increasing labor productivity, for the comprehensive mechanization and automation of production processes, and against technical stagnation, backwardness, and conservatism.

    The appeal to all working people called for bolder adoption of new technologies and better utilization of potential and production capacity.

    The CPSU Central Committee called for vigorous development of advanced science, firm mastery of new technologies, wider promotion of the experience of production innovators, and further development of the mass movement for rationalization proposals and inventions.

    The appeal to all working people emphasized that the Soviet Union has started implementing the Seven-Year Plan very well. The industry of all republics and economic regions has overfulfilled the plan for the first six months of 1959. Agricultural work is progressing smoothly. All sectors of the national economy are confidently accelerating to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

    The appeal to all working people said, "The words 'Seven-Year Plan' have spread all over the world, arousing the praise of all progressive humanity, causing great excitement among our class brothers and giving them greater confidence in the victory of socialism. These words make the enemies of socialism tremble with fear."

    The appeal to all working people said that no capitalist country could announce to the world that it would increase the total output of industrial products by 80% in seven years, double the production of electricity, double the production capacity of chemical industrial enterprises, increase the real income of workers and farmers by 40%, build fifteen million housing units in cities, and build seven million houses in the countryside. The appeal to all working people said, but we have announced it, and we will certainly do it.

    The CPSU Central Committee recalled the most important tasks in the Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965).

    In seven years, the generating capacity of power stations will increase by 60 million kilowatts, equivalent to one hundred Lenin Hydropower Stations on the Dnieper River.

    By the end of the Seven-Year Plan, the Soviet Union will produce nearly 90 million tons of steel annually, which is more than all the capitalist countries of Europe currently produce.

    The increase in steel production during the Seven-Year Plan is equivalent to the output of twenty of the Soviet Union's largest Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Combine plants.

    In 1965, the daily output of the machine-building and metal-processing industries will be equal to the total annual output of pre-revolutionary Russia in 1913.

    During the Seven-Year Plan, housing with a floor area of 650 million to 660 million square meters will be built. This is equivalent to the appearance of fifteen new cities like Moscow in the country.

    The appeal to all working people emphasized that the great measures of comprehensive mechanization and automation of production processes in all sectors of the national economy, as stipulated by the CPSU Central Committee, are aimed at improving people's lives, increasing people's material and spiritual wealth, and further strengthening the power of the Soviet Union.

    The CPSU Central Committee called on every labor collective to formulate plans for mastering and applying scientific and technological achievements and the achievements of automation science, and to make better use of production potential and production sites, so as to reach the milestones of the Seven-Year Plan more quickly.

    苏共中央全会向全苏人民发出号召
    广泛开展技术革新全民竞赛
    新华社1日讯　塔斯社莫斯科6月30日电：6月29日闭幕的苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议通过了告工人、集体农民、苏维埃知识分子，苏联全体劳动人民书，号召全国人民为提前完成七年计划、为技术革新而广泛开展全民性的社会主义竞赛。
    全会号召劳动人民为提高劳动生产率、为生产过程的全盘机械化和自动化，为反对在技术上停滞、落后和保守主义而斗争。
    告全体劳动人民书号召更大胆地采用新技术，更好地利用潜力和生产能力。
    苏共中央全会号召尽力发展先进科学，坚决地掌握新技术，更广泛地推广生产革新者的经验，进一步开展群众性的合理化建议和发明创造运动。
    告全体劳动人民书着重指出，苏联开始执行七年计划的情况非常好。所有加盟共和国和经济区的工业都超额完成了1959年头六个月的计划。农业工作正在顺利进行。国民经济各部门满怀信心地加快速度，以便提前完成七年计划。
    告全体劳动人民书中说，“七年计划”这几个字已经传遍了全世界，引起了全体进步人类的赞扬，引起了我们的阶级弟兄们的极大兴奋并使他们对社会主义的胜利抱有更大的信心。这几个字使社会主义的敌人胆战心惊。
    告全体劳动人民书中说，任何一个资本主义国家都不可能向全世界宣布，它在七年之内要使工业产品的总产量增加80％，使电力的生产增加一倍，使化学工业企业生产的能力增加两倍，使工人和农民的实际收入提高40％，要在城市建筑一千五百万套住宅，在农村建筑七百万栋住房。告全体劳动人民书说，而我们这样宣布了，并将确实地这样去做。
    苏共中央全会追述了七年计划
  （1959—1965年）中的最重要的任务。
    七年内，发电站的发电能力将增加六千万瓩，相当于一百个第聂伯河上的列宁水电站。
    七年计划完成时，苏联将年产近九千万吨钢，即比目前欧洲所有资本主义国家生产的钢还要多。
    钢材的生产在七年计划中的增长额相当于苏联二十个生产能力最大的马格尼托哥尔斯克冶金联合工厂的产量。
    1965年机器制造业和金属加工业一天的产量就将等于革命前俄国1913年全年的产量。
    七年计划期间将要建筑面积为六亿五千万到六亿六千万平方公尺的住宅。这相当于在国内出现十五座像莫斯科这样的新城市。
    告全体劳动人民书着重指出，苏共中央全会所规定的国民经济所有部门生产过程全盘机械化和自动化的巨大措施，其目的在于改善人民的生活、增加人民的物质财富和精神财富、进一步加强苏联的威力。
    苏共中央全会号召每一个劳动集体制定掌握和运用科学技术成就和自动化科学成就的计划，更好地利用生产潜力和生产场地，以便更快地达到七年计划的里程碑。
