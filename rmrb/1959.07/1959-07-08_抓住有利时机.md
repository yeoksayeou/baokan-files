Seize the Favorable Opportunity

    The transportation of timber is an important link in timber production. Felling trees on the mountain does not mean that the production task has been completed. They must be transported down the mountain and to various construction and production departments before they can have use value.

    In the southern provinces of our country, a large part of the timber needs to be transported by water. Letting the timber down the mountain and using small rivers to reach the big rivers to replace land transportation is the most economical method. Now is the season when the river water is rising, which is a great time for floating timber. We should make full use of this favorable opportunity to rush the timber out. In addition to drawing a certain number of laborers to do the regular timber transportation work, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region also seizes the favorable season, organizes labor in the slack season of farming, lays tracks, opens up routes, and rushes to transport the timber. This practice is worth promoting.

    抓住有利时机
    木材的运输，是木材生产当中的重要环节。木材从山上砍倒，并不等于已经完成了生产任务，必须把它从山上运下来，运到各个建设和生产部门去，才能发生使用价值。
    我国南方各省，很大一部分木材要经过水上运输。木材从山上放下来，由小河流到大河，来代替陆上运输，这是个最经济的办法。现在正当河水上涨的季节，是流放木材的大好时光，应该充分利用这个有利时机，把木材抢运出来。广西僮族自治区除了抽调一定数量的劳力，做好经常性的木材运输工作以外，还抓住有利季节，在农事空隙组织劳力，铺设轨道，开辟航线，突击抢运，这种做法，值得推广。
