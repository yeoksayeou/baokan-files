Improve Enterprise Management Level

To effectively improve the level of enterprise management, it is necessary to combine immediate and long-term goals. This means starting from improving current production and focusing on the key aspects of enterprise production, while also taking a long-term view and comprehensively improving the level of enterprise management according to the development needs of the enterprise.

Enterprise management and production issues are not isolated from each other, but are interconnected and interdependent. In factories and mines, whether it is planning, technical management, or financial and labor management; whether it is output, quality, or cost, all these aspects influence and relate to each other. Grasping technical work will inevitably affect planning, finance, and labor work; focusing on quality will also affect output and cost. Therefore, solving immediate problems does not mean solving long-term problems; grasping individual management tasks does not mean a comprehensive improvement in management level; solving individual key production issues does not mean a comprehensive leap forward in production. Of course, a comprehensive improvement in enterprise management level must be a process and cannot be achieved "in one battle." It must be reformed continuously with plans and steps, according to the different production requirements of each period, to gradually achieve the goal of comprehensively improving the level of enterprise management.

In the process of rectifying and improving enterprise management, the principle of combining centralized leadership with mass movements must be implemented. The important aspect of combining centralized leadership with mass movements in enterprise management is the combination of professional management under the unified command of the factory director and mass management based on consciousness. For modern, socialist enterprises, professional management is not only objectively required, but also required by the masses, and is a manifestation of the concentrated will of the workers and masses on the production front. The masses have severely criticized the relaxation of professional management in many airing of views, which is the reason. We do not approve of having only mass management and no professional management in an enterprise, especially a modern enterprise. Having only professional management and no mass management is also not allowed in our socialist enterprises. Ultimately, we must have a factory director responsibility system under the unified leadership of the Party committee, a strong administrative management system under the unified command of the factory director, and the broad masses participating in management and supervising management; we must have both scientific and strict administrative management and vigorous mass movements; we must have both professional management and mass management. The mass management we advocate, to be precise, actually means that the masses, as the masters of an enterprise, participate in enterprise management. Therefore, in the process of rectifying and improving enterprise management, we must also pay attention to combining strengthening management, establishing and improving rules and regulations, with improving the consciousness of the masses.

The experience of the Nanjing Teaching Instrument Factory in following the mass line to improve and strengthen enterprise management tells us that the process of improving enterprise management is also the process of mobilizing the masses to participate in enterprise management. We must never understand improving enterprise management as formulating a few rules and regulations, or simply adopting top-down administrative methods to issue and implement them. Instead, we should implement the mass line of "from the masses, to the masses," combining bottom-up and top-down approaches.

### 提高企业管理水平

    提高企业管理水平
    要有效地提高企业管理水平，必须做到眼前与长远相结合，既要从搞好当前生产出发，围绕企业生产关键进行，又要高瞻远瞩，根据企业的发展需要，全面提高企业管理水平。
    企业的管理工作和生产上的问题，都不是彼此孤立的，而是环环相连，环环相扣的。在厂矿企业中，无论是计划、技术管理，或是财务、劳动管理；也无论是产量、质量或者成本方面的问题，都是相互影响、相互联系的。抓了技术工作，势必牵动计划、财务、劳动工作，抓质量，也会牵动产量与成本。因此，解决了眼前的问题，不等于解决了长远的问题；抓了单项管理，不等于管理水平的全面提高；解决了个别生产关键，不等于生产的全面跃进。当然，全面提高企业管理水平必须有个过程，不可能“毕其功于一役”，而必须有计划、有步骤，根据每个时期不同的生产要求不断进行改革，才能够逐步达到全面提高企业管理水平的目的。
    在整顿和改进企业管理的过程中，必须贯彻集中领导与群众运动相结合的原则。集中领导与群众运动相结合的原则，体现在企业管理方面的重要问题，也就是厂长统一指挥下的专业管理与建立在自觉基础上的群众管理相结合的问题。对于现代化的、社会主义性质的企业来说，专业管理不仅是客观所要求的，也是群众所要求的，而且是职工群众在生产战线上意志集中的表现。群众在不少鸣放意见中对放松专业管理进行了严厉的批评，就是这个道理。只有群众管理，不要专业管理，在一个企业——尤其是现代化的企业里来说，我们是不赞成的。只要专业管理，不要群众管理，在我们社会主义性质的企业里，也是不允许的。归根到底，我们既要有党委统一领导下的厂长负责制，有一套在厂长统一指挥下强有力的行政管理系统，又要有广大群众参与管理、监督管理；既要有科学的、严密的行政管理，又要有轰轰烈烈的群众运动；既要有专业管理，又要有群众管理。我们所提倡的群众管理，说得确切一些，实际上是说群众作为一个企业的主人，参与企业管理。因此，我们在整顿和改进企业管理工作的过程中，还必须注意使加强管理、建立与健全规章制度与提高群众的自觉性相结合。
    南京教学仪器厂走群众路线，改进和加强企业管理工作的经验告诉我们，提高企业管理水平的过程，也就是发动群众参加企业管理的过程，绝不能把改进企业管理工作，理解为搞几条规章制度，或者只是自上而下的采取行政路线的方法来颁布执行，而应该贯彻从群众中来，到群众中去，自下而上与自上而下相结合的群众路线。
