Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 3rd: Cuban Prime Minister Castro delivered a television speech today, sternly refuting Eisenhower's clamorous remarks made during a press conference in Washington on the 1st, calling for interference in Cuba's internal affairs.

	Castro emphasized that "Cuba will never allow anything to harm its sovereignty and dignity. No person, no country, or organization has the right to interfere in Cuba." He stated that Eisenhower's remarks would not frighten the Cuban people, who are ready at any moment to resist all provocations and aggressions, no matter where they come from. Castro emphasized that the interference rhetoric emanating from Washington is related to other plans. He said that Trujillo is preparing to attack Cuba to fulfill the mission given to him by his foreign masters.

	Prime Minister Castro, referring to the so-called "investigation" of the Caribbean situation planned by the "Organization of American States," said that this is part of a whole provocative conspiracy against Cuba, aimed at hindering revolutionary reforms. He said that Cuba resolutely opposes the investigation, "If they want to investigate, then let them investigate the misdeeds of the jackal Trujillo in the Dominican Republic."

	Castro quoted a famous saying of Cuban national hero José Martí, "It is better to die gloriously than to live in humiliation," to express the Cuban people's firm belief in defending their national independence. He said, "Foreign masters in Cuba are finished forever."

	Castro condemned the conspiracy to launch armed intervention in Cuba, orchestrated by the "Organization of American States" Council meeting in Washington on the 2nd. He said, "When napalm bombs and rockets were bombing us, the Organization of American States never uttered a sound, and no one asked to hold a meeting." He said, "Let's see if so-called democratic countries like the United States vote to support the tyrant Trujillo."

	When discussing the fact that U.S. imperialism is attempting to use the lie of "communist infiltration" as a pretext for its interference in Cuba, Castro said, "The only thing we can be condemned for is that we have established a motherland worthy of all Cubans. Accusations of us being communists are slanderous attacks by those who are unwilling to give up land and privileges in Cuba." Castro said, "The Soviet Union is 15,000 kilometers from Cuba. Would that the countries that are exploiting Cuba were that far away!"

	In his speech, Castro emphasized the need for unity among all revolutionary forces. He said:
	"Revolutionary unity should be maintained, although this does not necessarily mean that all classes participate in the regime." Castro condemned the reactionary elements' attacks on the Popular Socialist Party, saying, "All Cubans have the right and the obligation to defend the government's revolutionary measures."

    古巴主权和尊严不容外人干涉
    卡斯特罗驳斥艾森豪威尔干涉古巴内政的叫嚷
    新华社哈瓦那3日电　古巴总理卡斯特罗今天发表电视演说，严厉地驳斥艾森豪威尔1日在华盛顿举行记者招待会时发出的干涉古巴内政的叫嚣。
    卡斯特罗强调指出，“古巴决不会让任何东西来伤害它的主权和尊严。任何人、任何国家或组织都无权干涉古巴。”他表示，艾森豪威尔的发言不会吓倒古巴的人民，他们随时准备着抵抗一切挑衅和侵略，不论其来自何方。卡斯特罗强调指出，华盛顿发出的干涉言论是与其它计划相互关连的。他说，特鲁希略准备进攻古巴来完成外国主子给他的使命。
    卡斯特罗总理谈到“美洲国家组织”打算对加勒比海局势进行的所谓“调查”时说，这是反对古巴的整个挑衅阴谋的一部分，目的在于阻挠革命的改革。他说，古巴坚决反对调查，“如果他们想调查的话，就让他们去调查一下豺狼特鲁希略在多米尼加所干下的勾当吧。”
    卡斯特罗引用了古巴民族英雄何塞·马蒂的一句名言“宁可壮烈而死，不愿屈辱偷生”来表明古巴人民保卫祖国的独立的坚强信念。他说，“外国主子在古巴是永远完蛋了。”
    卡斯特罗谴责了2日在华盛顿举行的“美洲国家组织”理事会所策动的武装干涉古巴的阴谋。他说，
  “当凝固汽油弹和火箭轰炸我们的时候，美洲国家组织从来没有哼过一声，也没有人要求举行会议。”他说，“让我们看看，像美国之类所谓民主国家是不是投票支持暴君特鲁希略吧”。
    卡斯特罗在谈到，美帝国主义企图以“共产党渗入”这种谎言做为它干涉古巴的借口时说，“唯一可以谴责我们的事情就是，我们建立了一个无愧于所有古巴人的祖国，指责我们为共产党人，是那些不愿在古巴放弃土地和特权的人所进行的诽谤中伤”。卡斯特罗说，“苏联距古巴一万五千公里。但愿正在剥削古巴的国家距它这样远吧！”
    卡斯特罗在他的演说中强调了所有革命力量团结的必要。他说：
  “应该保持革命的团结，虽然这并不一定意味着各阶层都参加政权”。卡斯特罗斥责了反动分子对人民社会党的攻击，他说，“所有古巴人都有权利有义务保卫政府的革命措施”。
