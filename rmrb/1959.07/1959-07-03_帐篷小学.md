    Tent Elementary School

    Yingde'er Mountain took off its white robe, and the Dulan River rolled forward with chunks of ice... Spring has come to the grasslands.

    The tender green grassland, wherever the spring breeze passes, ripples like emerald waves; those jade-like, shimmering ripples, layer upon layer, surge into the distance, and then slowly disappear.

    A Tibetan elder and I spurred our horses, chasing those disappearing wave shadows. In the distance where the wave shadows vanished, several white dots faintly appeared.

    The Tibetan elder suddenly burst into loud laughter on his horse:
      "Didn't you want to understand the life of our Tibetan people? Look! Do you see those white dots? Let's go there."

    From a distance, those white dots seemed to be floating gently, like sails on a blue sea. Perhaps it's a flock of sheep!—I thought silently.

    Upon closer inspection, they turned out to be several tents.

    The Tibetan elder gently jumped off his horse, very carefully tethering it to a clump of feathergrass; then, he gestured for me not to speak loudly, his expression so serious and full of piety.

    We stood quietly outside a tent, listening intently.

    At first, we heard a clear female voice reciting a Tibetan sentence; then a group of children's tender voices reciting the same Tibetan sentence. The sounds floated around, reaching far into the distance...

    It turned out to be a tent elementary school.

    The Tibetan elder listened attentively, sometimes nodding and smiling, sometimes with tears glistening in his eyes.

    From his expression, I seemed to see his childhood:

    On a snowy evening, a Tibetan child trudged along a mountain road filled with the howls of wolves and tigers, driving a flock of sheep, covered in wind and snow, with tears streaming down his face, wearily returning to the herdboy's sheepfold... The herdboy whipped his emaciated body harshly, and he cried sadly.

    Suddenly, I was awakened by a burst of noisy singing. Around me, a group of Tibetan elementary school students were playing and frolicking, and a silver bell-like laughter echoed across the grassland. They rolled playfully on the grass for a while, and then jumped up to support themselves on the shoulders of the Tibetan elder.

    I heard the young, unrestrained laughter of the Tibetan elder.

    I seemed to see a flock of spring birds just spreading their wings, flying towards the boundless blue sky. (Attached image)

    帐篷小学
    野艾
    英德尔山脱下了白袍，都兰河卷带着块块冰凌，向前流去……。春天，来到了草原。
    那嫩绿的草原，春风过处，碧波涌动；那翡翠似的、闪亮的波纹，一层层地荡向远方，然后慢慢隐去。
    我和一个藏族老人，策马追赶着那远去的波影。在波影消失的远方，隐隐显现出几个白点。
    藏族老人忽然在马上朗声大笑起来：
      “你不是要了解我们藏族人民的生活吗？喏！看到那些白点了吗？我们到那里去。”
    远远看去，那白点好像在轻轻浮动，犹如碧海上的帆影。也许是羊群吧！——我默默地想着。
    近前一看，原来是几顶帐篷。
    藏族老人轻轻地跳下了马，十分小心地把马拴在一堆芨芨草上；接着，还向我做了一个不要高声说话的手势，表情是那么严肃，而又满怀虔诚。
    我们静悄悄地伫立在一个帐篷外面，侧耳倾听着。
    开始，我们听到一个清脆的女声，朗诵着一句藏文；接着是一群孩子们的稚嫩的嗓音，朗诵着同一句藏文。声音，在四围浮荡，向远处深去……
    原来，这是一所帐篷小学。
    那藏族老人凝神谛听着，忽而点头微笑，忽而泪花闪动。
    从他的表情中，我仿佛看到了他的童年：
    风雪的傍晚，一个藏族尕娃艰难地行走在狼嗥虎啸的山路上，他赶着一群羊，披着满身风雪，挂着两行眼泪，疲惫地走回到牧主的羊圈里去……。牧主用皮鞭狠狠地抽打他瘦骨嶙嶙的身子，他伤心地哭嚎着。
    忽然，我在一阵喧闹的歌声中清醒过来。在我的周围，一群藏族小学生在嬉戏、打闹，草原上卷起了一片银铃似的笑声。他们一会儿活泼地滚翻在草地上，一会儿又跃身攀扶上藏族老人的肩头。
    我听到了藏族老人年青的无羁的笑声。
    我像看到了一群展翅初飞的春鸟，正向无边的蓝空飞去。（附图片）
