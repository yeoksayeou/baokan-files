　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd: Jiangsu Province is making early arrangements for autumn planting and is stepping up preparations for production materials and basic farmland construction needed for autumn planting. According to the preliminary plan of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the province's autumn sown area this year will reach more than 53 million mu, an increase of more than 9 million mu over last year. The sown area of ​​grain, rapeseed, and green manure crops will increase compared to last year.
　　Jiangsu Province's autumn crop layout takes into account both the need to plant as much grain and oil crops as possible, and to actively expand the green manure area to increase the base fertilizer for the next summer planting. It also leaves a certain amount of fallow land to prepare for next year's spring planting, which is conducive to increasing overall production throughout the year. According to this requirement, the province plans to increase the area of ​​autumn-sown grain crops by more than 6 million mu compared with the actual harvested area this summer. Various localities are also preparing to universally promote interplanting of Da Yuan wheat in green manure fields and interplanting of peas in Da Yuan wheat fields to increase grain production.
　　In arranging autumn planting, all localities attach particular importance to the development of oil crops. The province plans to increase the rapeseed harvest area from 930,000 mu this year to 2.5 million mu. The Xuhuai area, where rapeseed was rarely planted in the past, is also preparing to sow 500,000 mu this year. Another feature of this year's autumn planting layout is the rapid increase in the winter green manure area. The province plans to sow 8 million mu, an increase of nearly 50% compared to this year's actual harvest area. This green manure can be used as part of the base fertilizer for the next spring and summer planting, and can also be used as feed, which is also beneficial to promoting animal husbandry production. The Xuhuai area, which has never had the habit of planting green manure, is also preparing to sow 1.6 million mu of green manure this year.
　　In order to realize this year's autumn planting plan, all localities in the province have begun to strengthen the feeding and management of draught animals and the repair and replacement of autumn planting tools, especially the repair of large-scale agricultural tools such as agricultural boats and carts. In terms of farmland water conservancy construction, various localities are strengthening the repair of ponds, dams, and canals to prepare for the irrigation of autumn-sown crops.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 22nd: All parts of Sichuan Province are starting early to prepare for autumn planting.
　　Wanxian, Ya'an, Fuling, Yibin, Jiangjin and other special districts have recently sent many work teams, adopting a combination of top-down and bottom-up methods, to mobilize the masses to check the reserve of seeds. In order to solve the problem of insufficient seeds in some communes, the Wanxian Special District carried out seed transfer work within the district.
　　Many places have begun to prepare farm tools and fertilizers for autumn planting. The commercial departments of Nanbu County have prepared 600,000 pieces of autumn harvest and autumn planting tools, reaching 99% of the original plan. Yingshan County has reserved 70% of the needed autumn harvest and autumn planting tools. The Yongxing Commune in Mianyang County recently inspected autumn harvest and autumn planting farm tools, and mobilized the masses to use their spare time to repair small farm tools. More than 17,000 various farm tools have been repaired, plus more than 25,000 newly made farm tools, which are basically enough for the entire commune to use. Under the slogan of "Fight hard for a week, fill every pit, and ensure another high yield of minor spring crops next year," the members of the Wangchuan Commune People's Management District in Hechuan County accumulated more than 4 million catties of fertilizer in five days.
　　Summarizing this year's bumper harvest experience and striving for greater increases in agricultural production next year is an important part of the autumn planting preparation work in various localities. Since the end of the wheat harvest, most special districts and many counties and communes have generally summarized local large-area high-yield experiences through various methods such as meetings, seminars, investigations, and visits. The high-yield experiences in various places generally prove that this year's bumper harvest is the victory of fully mobilizing the masses and conscientiously implementing the Eight-Point Charter under the correct leadership of the Party; deep plowing, fertilization, rational close planting, and the use of fine varieties are important foundations for increasing production. After summarizing this year's bumper harvest experience, all localities, after full discussion, have begun to formulate production plans for next year's minor spring crops. According to these plans, the winter planting area in various places this year will increase compared to last winter.

### 江苏计划多种粮食油料作物  四川调剂良种修造农具着手制订小春作物计划

    江苏计划多种粮食油料作物
    四川调剂良种修造农具着手制订小春作物计划
    新华社南京22日电　江苏省及早安排秋播，抓紧准备秋播需用的生产资料和农田基本建设。根据中共江苏省委的初步计划，今年全省秋田播种面积将达到五千三百多万亩，比去年扩大九百余万亩。粮食、油菜、绿肥作物的播种面积比去年都有增加。
    江苏省秋播作物布局既考虑到尽可能多种一些粮食和油料作物，又要积极扩大绿肥面积，以增加来年夏播基肥；还要留出一定数量的休闲田，为明年春播准备茬口，有利于全年全面增产。按照这个要求，全省今年计划秋播粮食作物的面积，比今年夏季实收面积增加六百余万亩，各地并准备普遍推广在绿肥田里间种大元麦，在大元麦田里间种豌豆，以增产粮食。
    在安排秋播中，各地特别重视发展油料作物，全省计划油菜收获面积要由今年九十三万亩增加到二百五十万亩。以往种植油菜很少的徐淮地区，今年也准备播种五十万亩。今年秋播布局的另一个特点是冬季绿肥面积的迅速增加。全省计划播种八百万亩，比今年实收面积增加近50％，这些绿肥既可以作为明年春播夏种中的一部分基肥，又能作饲料，对推动畜牧业生产也有好处。一向没有种植绿肥习惯的徐淮地区今年也准备播种绿肥一百六十万亩。
    为了实现今年的秋播规划，全省各地都已开始加强耕畜的饲养管理，和秋种工具的整修添置，特别是农船、大车等大型农具的修补工作。在农田水利建设方面，各地正在加强整修塘、坝、渠道，作好秋播作物的灌溉准备。
    新华社成都22日电　四川省各地及早动手准备秋种。
    万县、雅安、涪陵、宜宾、江津等专区最近派出许多工作组，采取上下结合的办法，发动群众检查种籽储备情况。万县专区为了解决部分公社种籽不足的问题，在区内进行了种籽调剂工作。
    许多地方已着手为秋种准备农具和肥料。南部县商业部门已经准备秋收秋种工具六十万件，达到原计划的99％。营山县储备好了的秋收秋种工具，占需要量的70％。绵阳县永兴公社最近检查了秋收秋种农具，发动群众利用空闲时间修补小农具，已修好各种农具一万七千多件，加上新制的农具二万五千多件，基本上够全社使用了。合川县望川公社人民管理区社员们，在“大战一星期，坑坑都添满，保证明年小春再高产”的口号下，五天内积肥四百多万斤。
    总结今年丰收经验，争取明年农作物更大的增产，是各地秋播准备工作的重要内容。从麦收结束以来，绝大部分专区和许多县、社都普遍通过会议、座谈、调查、参观等多种多样方式，总结当地大面积高产经验。各地高产经验普遍证明，今年大丰收是在党的正确领导下，充分发动群众，认真贯彻八字宪法的胜利；深耕、施肥、合理密植和采用良种等几个中心环节，是增产的重要基础。各地在总结今年丰产经验后，经过充分讨论，都着手制订了明年小春作物的生产计划。按照这些计划，各地今年的冬播面积，比去冬都有增加。
