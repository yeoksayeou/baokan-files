Affirm Product Performance, Offer Improvement Suggestions, Better Serve Production
Hebei Appraises Scientific Research Achievements

    (Reported by this newspaper) In order to understand the quality of scientific research achievements and to enable research achievements to be quickly promoted and applied to production, the Hebei Provincial Science and Technology Commission and the Tianjin Municipal Science and Technology Commission organized relevant parties to appraise new products and technologies successfully researched and trial-produced in 1958.

    The focus of the appraisal was on projects of significant importance to the completion of this year's industrial and agricultural production plans and the "Six Great Equipments," as well as projects that are high-end, precise, cutting-edge, or have universal promotional value. They classified the appraisal according to the size and complexity of these projects. For major projects with more problems, the city or municipal professional bureau took the lead in organizing the appraisal. For general projects with fewer problems or those that are more mature, the research and trial production unit took the lead, with the city or professional bureau assisting in organizing the appraisal. For projects with strong academic characteristics, the Science and Technology Association organized the appraisal. Through the appraisal, the performance of the products was affirmed. General evaluations also included analyses and comparisons with similar advanced products at home and abroad, evaluations of economic significance, and appraisals of production technology. Opinions were put forward on putting them into production or promoting them, and suggestions for improvement were also made for the problems discovered.

    The results of the appraisal of thirty-five projects showed that twenty-three items could be put into production or promoted, five items could be applied and promoted after certain improvements, and seven items had more problems and needed further research. Among the twenty-three projects that were affirmed to be put into production and promoted, although more than a dozen projects had been in some production in the past, the promotion and application were not widespread enough. At the same time, there were also several projects that had not been put into production because they had not been appraised. For example, dye-free dyeing was created by the masses during the technical revolution movement last year. In order to find the theoretical basis for this creation and provide conditions for putting it into production, the Tianjin Municipal Science and Technology Commission once organized the relevant inventors to conduct a period of laboratory research work and achieved many results, but these achievements were not quickly and systematically promoted to production. Through this appraisal, it was affirmed that those methods could be promoted and applied in production, which was a great encouragement to the inventors. For the five projects that were basically successful but not perfect or had certain problems, the appraisal promoted the successful testing of these projects so that they could be promoted and applied more quickly. For the seven projects with more problems that could not be applied and promoted, the problems and future directions were also pointed out. This appraisal not only appraised research results, facilitating promotion, but also promoted the development of science and technology and improved the level of science and technology.

    This appraisal adopted the method of combining Party leadership, scientific and technical personnel, and workers, and invited experts from universities and scientific departments, as well as representatives from commercial departments and user departments, to participate. At the same time, the appraisal work was combined with academic discussions to encourage everyone to raise questions from different perspectives, so that different views and opinions could be fully discussed and debated. Some problems that had not been solved for a long time were solved. For example, the process route of epoxy resin, the role of hydrogen in the refrigeration system of absorption-type heating refrigerators, and the development direction of some new products have all reached clear conclusions. During the appraisal of absorption-type heating refrigerators, some people argued that absorption-type heating refrigerators could completely replace compression-type refrigerators, while others argued that absorption-type heating refrigerators were not a development direction at all. After debate, it was finally affirmed that absorption-type heating refrigerators, because of their slower cooling effect, could not completely replace compression-type refrigerators. However, because they are simple in structure, easy to manufacture, and China has abundant solid fuels and many heat sources, especially the ability to utilize waste heat, it is one of the development directions, and everyone unanimously affirmed that it could be put into production. This appraisal also solved some scientific and technical problems for many projects themselves, prompting these projects to become more perfect and mature, and more capable of being put into production and promotion.

    In addition, the appraisal also promoted the collation and accumulation of technical data. In the past, most of these appraised projects did not collate data in a timely manner, and even if there was data, it was incomplete and could not be used as a basis for guiding production and promotion. Through appraisal, technical data were collated in a relatively detailed and comprehensive manner, and the immature and defective parts of the past were corrected, providing conditions for exchange and promotion.

### 肯定产品性能　提出改进意见　更好服务生产  河北鉴定科学研究成果

    肯定产品性能　提出改进意见　更好服务生产
    河北鉴定科学研究成果
    本报讯　为了了解科学研究成果的质量，为了使研究成果能够迅速推广、应用于生产，河北省科学技术委员会和天津市科学技术委员会组织有关方面的力量，对1958年研究试制成功的新产品、新技术进行了鉴定。
    鉴定的重点是对完成今年工、农业生产计划和六大设备有重大意义的项目，以及属于高、精、尖或是具有普遍推广价值的项目。他们根据这些项目的大小和复杂程度分级鉴定，属于重大项目、问题比较多的，以市或市专业局为主，组织力量进行鉴定；属于一般项目、问题较少或比较成熟的，以研究试制单位为主，由市或专业局协助组织力量进行鉴定；对学术性较强的项目，组织科学技术协会的力量进行鉴定。通过鉴定，肯定了产品性能，一般的还作了与国内外同类先进产品的分析对比和经济意义评价，并进行了生产工艺的鉴定，提出了投入生产或推广的意见，同时也对发现的问题，提出了改进意见。
    这次对三十五个项目鉴定的结果，有二十三项可以投入生产或推广，有五项经过某些改进就可以应用和推广，有七项问题较多，还需要进一步研究。在肯定可以投入生产和推广的二十三个项目中，虽然有十几个项目过去曾经进行了一些生产，但是在推广应用上还是不够广泛的。同时也有几个项目，因为没有经过鉴定未敢投入生产。例如不用染料染色，是在去年技术革命运动中由群众创造出来的，天津市科学技术委员会为了找出这一创造的理论根据，并为投入生产提供条件，曾经把有关的发明创造者组织起来，进行了一个时期试验室的研究工作，取得了不少成绩，但这些成果并没有迅速系统地推广到生产中去。通过这次鉴定，肯定了其中那些方法是可以在生产上推广应用的，同时对发明创造者是一个很大的鼓舞。对五个已经基本成功，但还不完善或有一定问题的项目，经过鉴定，促进了这些项目的试验成功，以便更快地推广应用。对七个问题较多，还不能应用推广的项目，也指出了问题所在和今后努力方向。通过这次鉴定，不仅鉴定了研究成果，便于推广，而且促进了科学技术的发展，提高了科学技术水平。
    这次鉴定，采取了党的领导、科学技术人员和工人相结合的办法，并聘请了大学和科学部门的专家，商业部门、使用部门等方面的代表参加。同时把鉴定工作和学术讨论结合起来，启发大家从各个不同角度提出问题，使不同的看法和意见得到充分的讨论、争辩。有些长期没有得到解决的问题得到了解决。例如，环氧树脂的工艺路线问题，吸收式加热电冰箱、氢气在制冷系统中的作用问题，以及一些新产品的发展方向问题，都有了明确的结论。在鉴定吸收式加热电冰箱的时候，有人主张吸收式加热电冰箱完全可以代替压缩式冰箱，有人主张吸收式加热电冰箱根本不是发展方向。经过争辩，最后肯定吸收式加热电冷箱，因为制冷效较慢，还不能完全代替压缩式的；但它构造简单，制造方便，我国固定燃料又丰富，热源多，特别是可以利用废热，因此它是发展方向之一，大家一致肯定可以投入生产。这次鉴定也为许多项目本身解决了一些科学技术上的问题，促使这些项目更加完善和成熟，更加具备投入生产和推广的条件。
    此外，通过鉴定还促进了技术资料的整理和积累。鉴定的这些项目过去大多没有及时整理资料，即使有资料，也是残损不全的，不能作为指导生产和推广的依据，通过鉴定都比较细致全面地整理了技术资料，订正了过去不成熟和有缺点的部分，为交流推广提供了条件。
