    Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division
    Liu Qing
    In the movement to increase production and practice thrift, a trend of careful accounting is flourishing. Accounting naturally involves addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. "Increasing production" requires adding weights to the production scale one by one; "practicing thrift" requires reducing expenditures and waste item by item. Production grows an inch one day and a foot in ten days. “Many grains of sand form a pagoda, and many streams form a river.” As time passes, the accumulation of “increased production” and “thrift” becomes a huge material wealth. As the old saying goes, "Without accumulating small streams, there can be no rivers or seas," and "Building a family is like picking soil with a needle, while ruining a family is like waves washing sand away." Those who are good at accounting are well aware of the power of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    Everyone should learn to account from the perspective of the overall situation and national interests. Whether it is increasing production or practicing thrift, everyone should pick up the abacus and do some calculations. Some things seem small and insignificant, but if we calculate them from the perspective of the 600 million people nationwide, they become much more meaningful. Let's do some calculations: If everyone saves one yuan, this number is truly insignificant. However, if everyone in the country does this, it would add 650 million yuan to the country's construction funds. If everyone saves one jin of grain per month, which is not much, the entire nation would save 7.8 billion jin in a year, enough for more than 20 million people to eat for a year. Last year, our country had a bumper grain harvest, and some people once felt that wasting a little was not a big deal. In fact, after careful calculation, besides the grain used for seeds and industry, the amount distributed to 650 million people is not abundant. Now, the three summer harvests are arriving, bringing joy and cheer. When harvesting wheat, some people feel that scattering a little is nothing. However, the wheat-collecting teams organized in Dali and other eight counties in Shaanxi province picked up 11.76 million jin of wheat. These are such astonishing figures! Thus, these addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division calculations allow us to understand a principle: We must weigh the importance of everything from the perspective of the interests of the 600 million people nationwide. Only in this way can we truly be well-informed.
    I remember a Greek philosopher asked an interesting question, saying, "Adding a grain of wheat can form a heap of wheat, and plucking a hair can turn someone bald." It sounds almost like a joke. But there is a certain truth in it. Of course, in general, adding a grain of wheat will not form a heap of wheat, and plucking a hair will not lead to baldness. However, things are developing, and to a certain extent, the wheat heap and baldness will become clearly visible. Those of our comrades who are not yet good at using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division may wish to revisit arithmetic from here, focusing on the big picture while starting with small things, and not letting go of any trickles!

    加减乘除
    柳青
    在增产节约运动中，大兴算账之风。算账，自然离不开加减乘除。“增产”，要一个一个地增加生产的法码；“节约”，要一笔一笔地减少开支、减少浪费。生产一天长一寸，十天长一丈，“积沙成塔，汇水成川”，日子长了，点点滴滴的“增产”和“节约”就变成了巨大的物资财富。老话说“不积小流无以成江河”、“起家犹如针挑土，败家犹如浪淘沙”，会算账的人，对于加减乘除的厉害是一清二楚的。
    每个人都应该学会从整体观念和国家利益出发去算账。增产也好，节约也好，都应该拿起算盘去算一番。有些事情看来很小，无关紧要，可是，如果从全国六亿人民出发作一番加减乘除的计算，事情就有意义得多了。我们不妨算一算：每人储蓄一元，这数字真是微乎其微，如果全国人民都这样做，就能给国家增加六亿五千万元的建设资金；每人每月节约一斤粮，不算多，可是全国人口一年就节约七十八亿斤，够二千多万人吃一年；去年我国粮食大丰收，有些人一度觉得浪费一点没有关系，其实，仔细一算，除了种籽用粮、工业用粮等以外，分配在六亿五千万人的身上并不富裕；现在，三麦登场，喜气洋洋，割麦子的时候有人又觉得抛撒一点没有什么，可是陕西大荔等八县组织拾麦队，一拣又拾回麦子一千一百七十六万斤。这是多么惊人的一些数字！如此，加减乘除这么一算，使我们悟出了一个道理：看任何事情都要从全国六亿人民的利益出发权衡轻重。这才能真正作到心中有数。
    记得希腊哲学家讲过一个有趣的问题，说：“增加一粒麦可以形成麦堆，拔去一根头发，可以变成秃子。”听来，近乎笑谈。但其中确有一番道理。当然，在一般情况下，增加一粒麦，不会形成麦堆，拔去一根头发也不致变成秃子。但是，事物在发展着，到了一定的程度，那麦堆和秃子就显然可见了。我们那些还不善于运用加减乘除的同志们，不妨从这里重温一下算术，多从大处着眼，小处着手，不放过一切涓涓细流！
