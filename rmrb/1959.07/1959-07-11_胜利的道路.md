    The Road to Victory
    Sha·Nachukedaoerji, Vice President of the Mongolia-China Friendship Association
    July 11, 1959, marks the 38th anniversary of the victory of our country's People's Revolution. On July 11, 1921, inspired by the Great October Socialist Revolution, the Mongolian working people, under the leadership of the People's Revolutionary Party and with the assistance of the victorious Russian proletariat, forever eliminated colonial and feudal oppression and established an independent people's government.

    Since then, under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and with the selfless assistance of the great Soviet people, the Mongolian people have begun to transform a backward country into a prosperous and advanced one.

    Our people inherited only a backward nomadic economy from the old system. Agriculture was very underdeveloped; industry, needless to say, because even complete handicrafts were rare. Our Party, following Lenin's teachings and relying on the enormous assistance of the victorious Russian working class, led our people directly from feudalism to the bright road of socialism, bypassing the stage of capitalist development.

    In the thirty-eight years since the victory of the People's Revolution, our country has made tremendous achievements. During this period, more than 97% of our country's farmers and herdsmen have joined agricultural and pastoral cooperatives. Handicraft workers, small merchants, artisans, etc., have also basically achieved cooperation. In this way, private ownership has been completely eliminated in both urban and rural areas, and a unified socialist economy has been formed. Socialist relations of production have triumphed in our country. Comrade Tsedenbal wrote in his analysis of the current situation: "Socialist relations of production have basically triumphed in our national economy. However, this does not mean that we have already provided this system with a material foundation. Therefore, accelerating the establishment of a material production base for socialism and making the relations of production more complete is our current task."

    In March 1959, the Third Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee analyzed and summarized the above-mentioned fundamental changes, and believed that our country has entered a new stage of development in comprehensively building socialism.

    The historic resolutions with international significance adopted by the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Seven-Year Plan for comprehensively building communism, as well as the Great Leap Forward of the great Chinese people and the leap-forward development of other fraternal countries in the entire socialist camp, are inspiring the Mongolian people who are building socialism.

    Thanks to the unprecedented upsurge in the political enthusiasm and labor zeal of our people, the 1958 plan for national economic and cultural development was successfully completed. The continuous increase in assistance from the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other countries in the socialist camp, as well as the further development of our people's patriotic labor zeal, have created favorable conditions for completing and overfulfilling the Three-Year Plan passed by the 13th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party. In view of the above-mentioned situation, the Third Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee considered it necessary to revise certain parts of the Three-Year Plan and add new projects. The great goal we are currently aiming to achieve is to pay special attention to expanding cultivated land and grain sowing areas. To fundamentally improve our pastoral forage base, continuously provide raw materials for industry, and provide agricultural products for the people in cities and settlements, mainly relying on the development of agriculture.

    In order to meet our country's needs for grain and flour processed by ourselves in a few years, the Party and the government have put forward the new issue of large-scale reclamation of wasteland as the main task. It should be particularly pointed out here that the Mongolia-Soviet talks held in Moscow in February this year are of great significance for the reclamation and utilization of these wastelands.

    The new and enormous assistance provided by the Soviet government will greatly promote the socialist transformation and rapid development of our national economy, especially the large-scale development of agriculture and industry, and the utilization of natural resources to meet the needs of our country. During the Three-Year Plan period, our country will further develop industry. While building new factories with modern technical equipment, we will also complete the expansion and reconstruction of some existing factories with the assistance of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic. The new projects added by our Party and government to the Three-Year Plan for developing the national economy and culture will further boost our country's productive forces and comprehensively develop and consolidate the socialist part of agriculture and animal husbandry. On this basis, the living standards and cultural levels of the working people will be further improved. Our people unanimously believe that these new measures taken by the Party and the government are a new and clear sign of consistently and unswervingly caring for their lives and the prosperity and development of our country.

    The Mongolian people are now more closely united around their Party and government, giving full play to their strength and wisdom, and accelerating the socialist construction of the motherland in order to greet the 38th anniversary of the victory of the People's Revolution. When commemorating the great national festival, the Mongolian people express their infinite loyalty to the great cause of peace and socialism, and strive to make greater contributions to it. When commemorating their festival, the Mongolian people express their heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and the 650 million Chinese people headed by Comrade Mao Zedong for their fraternal assistance in the great cause of building socialism. The traditional friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese people has entered a new stage of development since the victory of the Chinese revolution in 1949. In the socialist family, the political, economic, and cultural cooperation between our two countries has been established on the solid foundation of proletarian internationalism. It is becoming more and more consolidated and developed year by year, not only for the interests of our two countries, but also for the interests of the entire peace and socialist camp. It should be particularly pointed out that the enormous material and human support and assistance that the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government have given and are giving to the Mongolian people in building socialism has become an important force inspiring our people to accelerate the building of socialism. In October 1958, our two countries simultaneously established the Mongolia-China Friendship Association and the China-Mongolia Friendship Association, respectively. This is a clear sign of the continuous consolidation of the fraternal, close, and eternal friendship between the Mongolian and Chinese people.

    In the early days of our people's revolutionary struggle against imperialism and feudal oppression, the great Chinese people carried out heroic struggles against international imperialism and their lackeys, the Chinese warlords, and against mercenaries, giving enormous spiritual support to our Mongolian people's struggle for freedom and independence. Now, the heroic Chinese people have been very enthusiastically supporting and helping the Mongolian people build socialism. The Mongolian people will never forget this great assistance and support from the Chinese people.

    As a member of the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, the people of the Mongolian People's Republic are presented with a broad path of development. The Mongolian people are advancing courageously and confidently for the great cause of communism and socialism, and for the friendship and cooperation of the people of all countries.

    胜利的道路
    蒙中友协副会长　沙·纳楚克道尔吉
    1959年7月11日，是我国人民革命胜利的三十八周年纪念日。1921年7月11日，在伟大十月社会主义革命的鼓舞下行动起来的蒙古劳动人民，在人民革命党的领导下，在胜利了的俄罗斯无产阶级的援助下，永远消灭了殖民压迫和封建压迫，建立了独立的人民政权。
    从那时候起，蒙古人民在蒙古人民革命党的领导下，在伟大苏联人民的无私的援助下，把落后的国家开始变成繁荣的先进国家。
    我国人民从旧制度所接受下来的只是落后的游牧经济。农业非常不发达；工业，更不用说，因为连完整的手工业也很少。我们的党，按照列宁的教导，依靠取得胜利的俄罗斯工人阶级的巨大援助，领导了我国人民，不经过资本主义发展阶段，从封建主义直接跨进社会主义的光明大道。
    人民革命胜利三十八年以来，我国已经取得了巨大成就。在这个期间，我国农牧民的97％以上都参加了农牧业合作社。手工业者、小商人、手工艺人等也都基本上实现了合作化。这样，在城市和乡村完全消灭了私人所有制，统一的社会主义经济已经形成。我国社会主义的生产关系已经取得胜利。泽登巴尔同志对当前形势作分析时写道：“在我国国民经济中社会主义的生产关系基本上已经取得胜利。但这并不意味着我们早已经使这个系统具备了物质基础。因此，加速建立社会主义物质生产的基础，使生产关系更加完整是我们当前的任务”。
    1959年3月，党中央三中全会曾分析和总结了上述的根本变化，认为我国已进入全面建设社会主义的新的发展阶段。
    苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会所通过的具有国际意义的历史性决议和全面建设共产主义的七年计划，以及伟大中国人民的大跃进和整个社会主义阵营其他兄弟国家的飞跃发展，鼓舞着正在建设社会主义的蒙古人民。
    由于我国人民的政治积极性和劳动干劲的空前高涨，胜利地完成了1958年国民经济和文化发展计划。苏联、中华人民共和国和社会主义阵营其他国家给予我国的援助的不断增加，以及我国人民爱国主义劳动干劲的进一步发挥，为完成和超额完成蒙古人民革命党第十三次代表大会所通过的三年计划创造了有利条件。鉴于上述情况，党中央三中全会认为有必要对三年计划的某些部分进行修改和增加新的项目。我们在目前要实现的巨大目标，是特别注意扩大耕地面积和谷物播种面积。从根本上改进我们的牧业饲料基地，不断为工业提供原料，为城市和定居点人民提供农产品，主要依靠农业的发展。
    党和政府为了在几年内用自己生产的谷物和自己加工的面粉满足我国的需要，已经把大规模开垦荒地的新问题，作为主要任务提出来了。这里特别应该指出，今年2月在莫斯科举行的蒙苏会谈，对开垦和使用这些荒地具有重大的意义。
    苏联政府所给予的新的巨大援助，对我国国民经济的社会主义改造和迅速发展，尤其是对农业和工业的大规模发展，以及利用自然富源满足本国的需要方面，将起巨大的推动作用。三年计划期间，我国进一步发展工业，在建设拥有现代技术设备的新工厂的同时，还要在苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国的援助下，完成对现有一部分工厂的扩建和改建工程。我们的党和政府在发展国民经济和文化三年计划中增加了新的项目，将使我国的生产力进一步高涨，并全面发展和巩固农牧业中的社会主义部分。在这个基础上，劳动人民的生活水平和文化水平将进一步得到提高。我国人民一致认为，党和政府所采取的这些新措施，是一贯坚持不渝地关心他们的生活和我国繁荣发展的新的鲜明标志。
    蒙古人民现在更加紧密地团结在自己的党和政府的周围，发挥自己的全部力量和智慧，加速祖国的社会主义建设，以便迎接人民革命胜利三十八周年。蒙古人民在纪念民族的伟大节日的时候，对和平和社会主义的伟大事业表示无限忠诚，并努力为它作出更大的贡献。蒙古人民在纪念自己的节日的时候，对在建设社会主义的伟大事业中给予我们兄弟般的援助的以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党、中国政府和六亿五千万中国人民表示衷心的感谢。蒙中两国人民的传统友谊从1949年中国革命取得胜利的时候起，进入了新的发展阶段。在社会主义大家庭中，我们两国之间的政治、经济、文化方面的合作，已经在无产阶级国际主义的坚固基础上建立起来。它不仅为我们两国的利益，而且为整个和平和社会主义阵营的利益，一年比一年巩固和发展起来。应该特别指出的是，中国共产党和人民政府对蒙古人民建设社会主义的事业所给予的和正在给予的巨大的物力、人力的支持和援助，已成为鼓舞我国人民加速建设社会主义的一种重要力量。在1958年10月，我们两国同时分别成立了蒙中友好协会和中蒙友好协会。这是蒙中两国人民的兄弟般的亲密无间的永恒友谊的不断巩固的鲜明标志。
    在反对帝国主义和封建压迫的我国人民革命斗争的初期，伟大的中国人民对国际帝国主义和它们的走狗中国军阀，以及对雇佣分子进行了英勇的斗争，在精神上对我们蒙古人民争取自由和独立的斗争给予了巨大的支持。现在，英雄的中国人民一直在非常热情地支持和帮助蒙古人民建设社会主义。蒙古人民永远不会忘记中国人民的这种伟大的援助和支持。
    作为以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭一员的，蒙古人民共和国的人民面前呈现着广阔的发展道路。蒙古人民正在满怀信心地为共产主义、社会主义的伟大事业，为各国人民的友谊和合作而奋勇前进。
