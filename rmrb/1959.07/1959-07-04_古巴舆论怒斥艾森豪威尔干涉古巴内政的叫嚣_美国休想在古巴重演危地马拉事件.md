Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: According to Xinhua News Agency, Cuban public opinion on July 2 strongly condemned the remarks made by U.S. President Eisenhower at a press conference held in Washington on July 1.

At the press conference, Eisenhower blatantly stated that the United States would use the "Organization of American States" to interfere in the increasingly high tide of national liberation movements in Cuba and the Caribbean region. Eisenhower expressed the above attitude of the U.S. government in response to a reporter's question. At that time, a reporter asked what actions the United States intended to take regarding the current situation in the Caribbean, because it was said that Cuba and the Dominican Republic were "possibly preparing to open fire."

In response to the reporter's question, Eisenhower said, "The United States has been trying to maintain friendly relations with friendly governments. It is unreasonable to close one's eyes to certain current situations in Central America and the Caribbean..." But he also said that the U.S. government could not openly interfere, because if it did, "we (the United States) will once again be called dollar imperialists or things like that." Eisenhower said that the United States must first rely on the Organization of American States to deal with these difficulties; if they can find reasons to take action, then they must suggest taking action.

In order to create a pretext for armed intervention in Cuba, Eisenhower attacked Cuban Prime Minister Castro and the Cuban revolutionary government. He said, "Since Fidel Castro has had absolute control of the government and power in Cuba, the Caribbean region has been in a state of turmoil. Since then, there have been three invasion incidents."

Eisenhower's remarks aroused great indignation in Cuban public opinion. The Cuban "July 26th Movement" organ "Revolución" published a commentary on the front page on July 2 entitled "Eisenhower and National Sovereignty," which questioned: "If (Dominican dictator) Trujillo invades Cuba and then asks the Organization of American States to intervene, will the United States intervene in Cuba?"

The newspaper said, "Our confidence in the revolution makes us a strong and invincible people." The newspaper said, "Trujillo, the Organization of American States, or any other country, if they one day invade Cuba, will be miserably defeated." It emphasized, "We are not isolated. The people of all countries in the world support us."

The Cuban People's Socialist Party's organ "Hoy" commented on the same day that Eisenhower's shameless statement was an important step on the possible path to aggression against Cuba. The newspaper revealed the United States' attempt to repeat the Guatemalan incident in Cuba, and emphasized that "however, the situation in Cuba is no longer the situation in Guatemala at that time, and the world today is also different from that time." Now, under the impetus of the Cuban revolution, the people of Latin American countries have begun to understand that "the United States appears to be powerful, but in reality, it is just a paper tiger. When the people rise up to defend their freedom, even atomic bombs cannot scare them."

The Cuban Revolutionary Directorate's organ "Combate" pointed out that the so-called danger of war in the Caribbean region was created by U.S. imperialism. Eisenhower cannot tout peace because the United States provides weapons to those who may start wars. The newspaper asked: If U.S. naval admirals openly fraternize with shameless pirates like Trujillo, how can the Caribbean be kept peaceful?

"Combate" firmly opposed the U.S. conspiracy to use the "Organization of American States" to interfere in Cuba, and pointed out that the problems of each country in the Caribbean are their own problems, and no one can interfere in these problems, otherwise it is an act of imperialism. "Combate" finally pointed out that patriots in all countries in the Caribbean region should mobilize and shout a common slogan! "Down with foreign interference! Support the Cuban Revolution!"

The day after Eisenhower made his remarks, the U.S.-controlled "Organization of American States" Council held a meeting to discuss the so-called "situation in the Caribbean region" in order to create a pretext for armed intervention in Cuba.

According to reports, the representative of the Dominican dictatorial regime once again described the anti-dictatorial armed struggle that broke out in the Dominican Republic as being "instigated" by Cuba. He clamored that this was an "international event" that "violated territory" and demanded that the "Organization of American States" intervene.

Cuban Foreign Minister Raúl Roa accused the Dominican Republic of fabricating utter rumors at the "Organization of American States" Council meeting. Roa pointed out that the Dominican dictatorial regime did so "to cover up its anti-Cuban and Venezuelan conspiracy that is being planned." He said that Cuba would oppose convening any meeting of American foreign ministers based on the "Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance" signed in Rio de Janeiro. Venezuelan representative to the "Organization of American States" Falcón also accused the Dominican Republic's accusations of being pure fabrication. He said, "He does not agree to convene this meeting to discuss the situation in the Caribbean region."

    古巴舆论怒斥艾森豪威尔干涉古巴内政的叫嚣
    美国休想在古巴重演危地马拉事件
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：古巴舆论2日强烈谴责美国总统艾森豪威尔1日在华盛顿举行的记者招待会上发表的谈话。
    艾森豪威尔在记者招待会上露骨地表示，美国将利用“美洲国家组织”来干预古巴和加勒比海地区日益高涨的民族解放运动。艾森豪威尔是在回答记者问时表达了美国政府的上述态度的。当时有记者问道，美国打算对加勒比海的目前局势采取什么行动，因为据说古巴和多米尼加之间“可能在准备开火”。
    艾森豪威尔在回答记者提出的问题时说，“美国一直在设法同友好的政府保持友好的关系。闭眼不看中美和加勒比海的当前的某些局势，是没有道理的……”。但是他又表示，美国政府不能公开出面进行干涉，因为如果这样做，“我们（美国）将再度被称为美元帝国主义者或者诸如此类的东西。”艾森豪威尔说，美国必须首先依靠美洲国家组织来处理这些困难；如果它们能够找到采取行动的理由，那么必须由它们建议采取行动。
    为了制造武装干涉古巴的借口，艾森豪威尔攻击了古巴总理卡斯特罗和古巴革命政府。他说，“自从菲德尔·卡斯特罗绝对控制了古巴的政府和政权起，加勒比海地区就在动荡不安的状态中。从那时起，已经发生了三起入侵事件。”
    艾森豪威尔的谈话引起了古巴舆论极大的愤慨。古巴“7月26日运动”机关报“革命报”2日在头版发表的题为“艾森豪威尔和民族主权”的评论质问道：“如果（多米尼加独裁者）特鲁希略侵略古巴，随后要求美洲国家组织干涉，美国是否就对古巴进行干涉呢？”
    报纸说，“我们对革命的信心使我们成为强大的和不可征服的人民。”报纸说，“特鲁希略、美洲国家组织或任何其它国家，如果有一天侵略古巴，必将遭到惨败的结局。”它强调指出，“我们不是孤立的。世界各国的人民都声援并支持我们。”
    古巴人民社会党的机关报“今日报”同一天的评论说，艾森豪威尔无耻的发言是侵略古巴的可能途径上的重要步骤。报纸揭露美国企图在古巴重演危地马拉事件，并且强调指出，“不过，古巴的形势已不是当年危地马拉的形势了，今天的世界也和当年不同了”，现在拉丁美洲各国人民在古巴革命的推动下，已经开始理解到，“美国貌似强大，而实际不过是一只纸老虎。当人民起来保卫他们自由的时候，就是原子弹也吓不倒的”。
    古巴革命指导委员会的机关报“战斗报”指出，所谓加勒比海地区的战争危险是美帝国主义制造的。艾森豪威尔不能标榜和平，因为美国把武器供给那些可能发动战争的人。报纸问道：如果美国的海军将领公开地同特鲁希略这类无耻的海盗称兄道弟，那么加勒比海又怎么能够保持安宁呢？
      “战斗报”坚决反对美国利用“美洲国家组织”干涉古巴的阴谋，并且指出，加勒比海每个国家的问题是他们自己的问题，对这些问题任何人都不能干涉，否则就是帝国主义行为。“战斗报”最后指出，加勒比海地区各国的爱国者都应该动员起来，喊出一个共同的口号！“打倒外国干涉！支持古巴革命！”
    在艾森豪威尔发表谈话的第二天，美国控制的“美洲国家组织”理事会，为了制造武装干涉古巴的借口，特举行了会议讨论所谓“加勒比海地区的局势问题”。
    据报道，多米尼加独裁政权的代表在会上再次把多米尼加爆发的反独裁武装斗争，说成是由古巴“策动”的。他叫嚷说，这是一个“侵犯领土”的“国际事件”，并且要求“美洲国家组织”进行干涉。
    古巴外交部长劳尔·罗亚在“美洲国家组织”理事会会议上指责多米尼加制造彻头彻尾的谣言。罗亚指出，多米尼加独裁政权这样做，是“想掩盖它正在策划的反古巴和委内瑞拉的阴谋”。他说，古巴将反对根据在里约热内卢签订的“泛美互助条约”来召开任何美洲国家外长会议。委内瑞拉驻“美洲国家组织”的代表法尔康也指责多米尼加的控告是纯粹的捏造。他说，“他不同意召开这次会议来讨论加勒比海地区的局势。”
