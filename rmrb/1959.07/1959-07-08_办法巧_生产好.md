    Clever Methods, Good Production
    Raising Ducks Without Grain
    "Duck eggs are exchanged for food, but raising ducks without grain is in vain," is what people have said for many years. However, the duck breeding production team of the Maiwang People's Commune in Hanchuan, Hubei, raised 6,800 ducks this year, and from January to the end of May, they did not feed them a single grain of food. Yet, the ducks grew very well and produced 54,500 jin of eggs, doubling the amount from last year.
    This team came up with many methods to find a lot of wild feed for the ducks. They not only diligently drove the ducks around, but also moved the duck sheds. They set up the sheds wherever there was wild feed. At the same time, they took advantage of local water conservancy conditions: when the water rose, they let the ducks go to the grass滩 to eat earthworms, to the dike slopes and embankment ridges to eat grass seeds, and to the 垸子 fields to eat wild water chestnuts; when the water receded, they let the ducks go to the lakeside to eat snails, or to the river ports to eat shrimp.
    Hatching Chickens
    The Shuangshuto Brigade of the Ciyutuo People's Commune in Liaozhong County, Liaoning, has a total of 217 households, raising a total of 1,738 chickens and ducks.
    Recently, this brigade launched a campaign for each household to hatch a brood of chickens. Each household has hatched more than 40 broods by exchanging hatching eggs with each other, with 579 chicks surviving. In addition to the 120 broods currently incubating, they also plan to hatch 50 more broods, striving to have an average of four chickens per person by the end of the year.
    Double Mating of Female Rabbits
    A six-jin English hybrid rabbit raised by Li Changsheng of the Jiubao People's Commune in Hangzhou used the double mating method and gave birth to 16 baby rabbits on June 5. These baby rabbits are strong and grow quickly, reaching more than three jin in two months.
    Sun Zhongkang of the Jiubao Chinese Medicine Prescription Department of the Commune Hospital also used the double mating method to breed a long-haired female rabbit, which gave birth to two litters in April and June. The first litter produced twelve baby rabbits, and the second litter produced eleven.
    Fresh Fish All Year Round
    The inland pond fish farming teams of the Nietang, Jingfang, and Liujia management areas of the Jianqiao People's Commune in Hangzhou have adopted the method of stocking in batches and layers, and catching in batches and layers, to produce fresh fish all year round.
    Stocking in batches and layers, and catching in batches and layers, according to the characteristics of various fish, is a method that these management areas successfully tested last year. For example, the upper layer of the Jingfang management area is stocked with silver carp and bighead carp, the middle layer is stocked with bream, grass carp, and bighead carp, and the bottom layer is stocked with carp and crucian carp. The fish fry are stocked in layers and batches, so the growth periods are different. One batch grows, one batch is caught, and then another batch is restocked. This cycle continues, and fresh fish can be produced all year round, overcoming the phenomenon that the supply of fresh fish was sometimes too much and sometimes too little in the past.
    These management areas have all organized professional fishing teams, diligently removing weeds from the fish ponds, diligently feeding them, draining water in time when it rains, and pumping water in time when it is dry, so the fish grow strong.
    Rice Paddy Fish Farming
    The Yonglu People's Commune in Yao County, Yunnan, is making extensive use of rice paddies for fish farming, and has now released fish fry in more than 1,600 mu of rice paddies.
    The Guanfang management area of this commune harvested more than 2,400 jin of fish raised in rice paddies last year. The masses believe that rice paddy fish farming has many benefits: "There are fewer weeds in the fields, it fertilizes the fields, and it is profitable, which is a win-win situation." Therefore, the commune party committee has seriously arranged the work of rice paddy fish farming this year, and wants to raise fish in all the rice paddies in the commune with good water conservancy conditions.
    Planting Lotus Roots to Get Lotus Root Vegetables
    The Jiafa People's Commune in Nanling County, Anhui, plans to plant 1,420 mu of lotus roots this year and is now transplanting them. In order to ensure the completion of this plan, the commune selected more than 50 mu of pond surface last winter to cultivate fine varieties.
    The commune members unanimously believe that planting lotus roots is a good sideline business with low cost, little labor, quick returns, high yield, wide use, and does not occupy arable land. Therefore, they have all pledged to plant well, manage well, and harvest well.
    Otter Rabbit
    Among the domestic rabbits raised in Mulei Kazakh Autonomous County, Xinjiang, there is a type of Rex rabbit, which generally weighs more than six market jin. Its whole body grows thick short down, and the fluff is like an otter, also known as an otter rabbit. This rabbit has a strong reproductive capacity, with an average of six or seven offspring per litter, and a maximum of fourteen or fifteen. (Attached picture)

    办法巧　生产好
    养鸭不用粮
    “鸭子蛋，食来换，养鸭无粮也枉然”，这是人们多年的说法。但是湖北汉川脉旺人民公社养殖场鸭业生产队今年养的六千八百只鸭子，从1月到5月底止，没有喂一粒粮食，鸭子却长得很好，产蛋五万四千五百斤，比去年增加一倍。
    这个队想出很多办法，为鸭子找到了不少野生饲料。他们放鸭不仅勤赶勤走，鸭棚也是移动的，那里有野生饲料就在那里下棚。同时，又利用当地水利条件：涨水时，就放鸭子到草滩吃蚯蚓，找堤坡、垸埂吃草籽，找垸子田吃野荸荠；退水时，就让鸭子到湖边吃螺蛳，或到河港吃虾子。
    孵鸡
    辽宁辽中县茨于坨公社双树坨大队，共二百一十七户，共养鸡鸭一千七百三十八只。
    最近这个大队展开了每户孵一窝鸡运动。每户用互相串换种蛋的办法，已经孵出四十多窝，成活鸡雏五百七十九只。除目前正在抱窝的一百二十窝外，还计划孵出五十窝，争取到年底平均每人有四只鸡。母兔双重配
    浙江杭州市九堡人民公社李长生养的一只六斤重的英系杂交兔，用双重交配法，6月5日一胎生了十六只小兔。这些小兔，体质强健，长得很快，两个月就能长到三斤多重。
    公社医院九堡国药配方部孙仲康饲养的一只长毛母兔，也用双重交配法，在4月和6月连生两胎，第一胎产小兔十二只，第二胎产十一只。
    一年四季有鲜鱼
    杭州市笕桥公社臬塘、景芳、六甲等管理区的内塘养鱼队，采取分批分层放养、分批分层捕捞的方法，作到一年四季都出产鲜鱼。
    根据各种鱼的特性，分批分层放养、分批分层捕捞，是这几个管理区去年试验成功的方法。像景芳管理区上层放养的是花白鲢鱼，中层放养的是鳊、鲢、包头鱼，底层放养的是鲤鱼和鲫鱼。鱼种分层分批放养，成长时期就不一样，成长一批，捕捞一批，然后再补放一批，这样循环不息，一年四季都能出产鲜鱼，克服了过去鲜鱼上市量有时过多，有时过少的现象。
    这几个管理区都组织了渔业专业队，对鱼塘勤除草，勤放饲料，天雨及时排水，天旱及时戽水，因此，鱼儿生长健壮。
    稻田养鱼
    云南大姚县永芦人民公社大量利用稻田养鱼，现在已在一千六百多亩稻田里放下了鱼苗。
    这个公社的官房管理区去年在稻田里放养的鱼共收二千四百多斤。群众认为稻田养鱼好处多：“田里少生杂草，又肥田，又有利，是两全其美”。因此今年公社党委又认真安排了稻田养鱼的工作，要把全社水利条件好的稻田都养上鱼。
    种藕得莲菜
    安徽南陵县家发人民公社计划今年植藕一千四百二十亩，现在正在移栽。为保证完成这个计划，这个社从去年冬季就选择了五十多亩塘面培育良种。
    这个公社的社员一致认为，植藕是一种成本低、花工少、收益快、产量高、用途广，又不占用耕地的好副业。因此，纷纷保证做到栽好、管好、收好。
    水獭兔
    新疆木垒哈萨克族自治县饲养的家兔中有一种力克斯兔，体重一般在六市斤以上，全身生长着浓厚的短绒，绒毛如水獭，又名水獭兔。这种兔繁殖能力强，母兔每胎平均可产六、七只，最多达到十四五只。（附图片）
