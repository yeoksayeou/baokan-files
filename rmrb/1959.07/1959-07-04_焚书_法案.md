	"Book Burning" Bill

	"Once upon a time, in a forest, lived a ferocious wolf. One day, it caught three little pigs. One was white, one was spotted, and one was black.

	The little black pig was very clever. Taking advantage of the wolf's unpreparedness, it escaped for its life. The little white pig and the little spotted pig were eaten by the wolf."

	This is the story outline of the children's book "The Three Little Pigs," which a state representative from Miami proposed to ban during the Florida State Legislature session.

	In late June, the sixty-day session of the Florida State Legislature concluded.
	(Note: The Florida State Legislature meets once every two years for a period of sixty days to review various proposals.) This session reviewed more than 3,500 proposals. The most notable during the session was the debate over several bills banning books. These bills awaiting passage were called "book burning" bills, and "The Three Little Pigs" was just one of them.

	Florida is one of the states in the United States where racial discrimination is most prevalent. Since 1954, Florida has passed thirty-three bills prohibiting the integration of black and white schools. The state legislators of Florida not only oppose integrated schools, but even the so-called "separate but equal" principle of a century ago has been rejected by them. Their claim is: "Segregation, the black race is inferior."

	The black pig in the "Three Little Pigs" story is smarter than the white pig, which caused dissatisfaction among the legislators, who proposed a ban. Because the state of Alabama's ban on the children's book "The Rabbit's Wedding" not long ago, which prohibited "black and white rabbits from marrying," caused international ridicule, the Florida legislators finally decided not to pass this bill for the time being.

	During the Florida State Legislature session, anti-communist clamoring was also expressed through "book burning" bills. The book "The Problems of Democracy" greatly angered the legislators because it openly declared that "The American Civil Liberties Union bravely fights for the rights of minorities." The legislators said that it could be determined that the American Civil Liberties Union is a subversive group.

	The legislators advocated banning the works of all progressive people. They welcomed the works of defected "communists" but advocated banning the publication of these people's works before they defected.

	The Florida State Legislature session ended in an uproar. The words of the Speaker of the House of Representatives are an apt self-portrait that outlines the entire face of the Florida State Legislature. This speaker had proposed a bill to establish a children's welfare station with US$25,000. After the proposal was rejected by a subcommittee, he announced:

	"This is a disgusting, dirty subcommittee. They rejected my little proposal. Now I request the House of Representatives to withdraw my original proposal from this flea-ridden committee." (Leshan) (Attached picture)

### “焚书”法案

    “焚书”法案
    “从前在一个森林里，住着一条凶恶的狼。有一天，它捉住了三只小猪。一只是白的，一只是花的，还有一只是黑的。
    小黑猪很聪明，它乘狼不备，没命地逃掉。小白猪和小花猪就被狼吃了。”
    这是在美国佛罗里达州州议会会期内，代表迈阿密市的州议员提出要求查禁的儿童读物“三只小猪”的故事梗概。
    6月下旬，历时六十日的佛罗里达州州议会会议闭幕了。
  （按：佛罗里达州州议会每两年举行会议一次，为期六十日，审查各项提案）。这次会议审议了三千五百多件提案。在会议期间最引人注目的，是关于若干查禁书籍的法案的争论。人们把这些待通过的法案叫做“焚书”法案，“三只小猪”只是其中的一件。
    佛罗里达州是美国种族歧视最为盛行的诸州之一。自从1954年以来，佛罗里达州通过了三十三个法案，禁止黑人与白人合校。佛罗里达州的州议员先生们，不但反对合校，而且连百年以前所谓“隔离，但地位平等”的主张，也遭受他们的排斥，他们的主张是：“隔离，黑人是劣等民族。”
      “三只小猪”故事中的黑猪比白猪聪明，因此引起了议员先生的不满，提出了查禁的要求。由于不久以前亚拉巴马州查禁儿童读物“小兔的婚礼”、禁止“黑白兔子结婚”的事件，引起了国际间的讪笑，佛罗里达州的议员先生们最后决定暂时不通过这项法案。
    在佛罗里达州州议会会议期间，反共叫嚣也是通过“焚书”法案来表达的。“民主的问题”这本书大大地触怒了议员先生们。因为它公开地宣称“美国公民自由同盟勇敢地为少数人的权利进行斗争。”议员先生说，可以断定美国公民自由同盟是一个颠复性的团体。
    议员先生们主张查禁一切进步人士的著作。他们欢迎变节的
  “共产党人”的著作，但是主张禁止发行这些人在变节以前的著作。
    佛罗里达州州议会会议是在喧闹中收场的。州众议院发言人的几句话，是勾画出佛罗里达州州议会整个面貌的、恰到好处的一篇自白。这位发言人曾经提出了一个议案，要求以美金二万五千元设立一所儿童福利站。他在提案被小组委员会否决以后，宣布说：
      “这是一个令人厌烦的、肮脏的小组委员会。他们否决了我的小小的提案。现在我请求众议院从这个充满了跳蚤的委员会里，撤消我的原提案。”（乐山）（附图片）
