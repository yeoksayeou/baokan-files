Shandong Establishes Fertilizer Base Points at All Levels
    Promoting Mass Fertilizer Accumulation Movement from Points to Areas

    (Our report) Shandong Province has universally established fertilizer accumulation and production base points, powerfully promoting the province-wide fertilizer accumulation and production movement, by setting up models at all levels and promoting from points to areas.
    Rapidly accumulating and producing more and better fertilizers has become the key to winning a greater harvest of autumn crops this year. To this end, Shandong Province, while extensively carrying out fertilizer accumulation and production work, has universally established fertilizer accumulation and production base points throughout the province. According to statistics up to mid-June, there were sixteen fertilizer accumulation and production base point counties in the province, with an average of two in each special zone (city); more than one hundred and sixty base point communes, with an average of two in each county; and most communes have generally achieved one to two base point production teams. These base points are generally counties, communes, and teams with a good working foundation and a high level of mass awareness. They represent different types and have different characteristics in fertilizer accumulation and production. In terms of topography, there are mountainous areas, plains, hills, and coastal areas; in terms of content, there are typical examples of comprehensively implementing fertilizer accumulation and production, typical examples of raising pigs to accumulate fertilizer, typical examples of vigorously developing indigenous fertilizers, and typical examples of implementing fertilizer accumulation and production policies. This has formed a fertilizer accumulation and production base point network throughout the province. According to preliminary experience, as long as the work of the base point network is grasped well, not only can the fertilizer accumulation work of the base points be carried out, but also the nationwide fertilizer accumulation and production movement can be promoted through the base point network. At present, party and government leaders at all levels are making full use of this working method, sending special personnel to the base points to understand and grasp the situation, strengthen leadership, cultivate them to become banners in fertilizer accumulation and production work, summarize their experience in fertilizer accumulation and production work, and promote these experiences through various forms. Therefore, fertilizer accumulation and production base points have become a powerful assistant to party committees at all levels in promoting the mass fertilizer accumulation and production movement. For example, in Liaocheng City, Liaocheng Special Zone, the city committee thoroughly implemented the policies of the central government and the provincial party committee on fertilizer accumulation and production, conscientiously cleared up the fertilizer investments of commune members last year, rationally formulated fertilizer prices and fertilizer accumulation and production rewards, restored feed land, and solved the specific difficulties existing in pig raising feed shortages and fertilizer accumulation. This fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members in accumulating and producing fertilizer, and launched a vigorous mass fertilizer accumulation movement in a short period of time, with an average application of about six thousand catties of fertilizer per mu. Under the leadership of the Liaocheng Prefectural Committee, the Liaocheng Municipal Committee summarized this experience; the Shandong Provincial Committee has forwarded the city's experience to various places to guide the development of fertilizer accumulation and production work in various places in a timely manner, solving significant problems.
    According to the source of fertilizer and the fertilizer needs of crops, the base points in various places have formulated fertilizer accumulation and production plans, specifically arranged the tasks of fertilizer accumulation and production that should be carried out at different times, and carried out mass fertilizer accumulation and production movements with summer fertilizer accumulation and production as the center. After the plans were formulated, many regions also mobilized the masses to conduct discussions, combined with the implementation of a set of systems such as "contracting," "fixing," and "rewarding" for fertilizer accumulation and production, so that the fertilizer accumulation and production plans were implemented on a reliable basis.
    From the preliminary experience of the base points in various places, the base points that have carried out fertilizer accumulation and production work well mainly grasp the following links:
    (1) Resolutely implementing various policies on fertilizer accumulation and production is the primary key to carrying out mass fertilizer accumulation and production. Fertilizer accumulation and production is a mass work, and the more fully the enthusiasm of the broad masses for accumulating and producing fertilizer can be brought into play, the more guaranteed the accumulation of more and better fertilizer will be. Experience in various places has proven that in addition to strengthening socialist ideological education, comprehensively implementing various specific policies on fertilizer accumulation and production is a decisive key to rapidly launching a mass fertilizer accumulation and production movement, to improve the awareness of the broad masses of commune members in accumulating fertilizer.
    (2) Strengthen leadership, formulate plans, and improve systems.
    (3) Combine regular fertilizer accumulation with shock fertilizer accumulation, and combine collective fertilizer accumulation with commune member family fertilizer accumulation.
    (4) Improve fertilizer quality and solve transportation difficulties. In terms of improving quality, the following measures are currently mainly adopted: ① Implement price based on quality in policy; ② Strengthen technical guidance in fertilizer accumulation, and issue technical guidance materials; ③ Establish fertilizer testing laboratories to identify the fertilizer efficiency of different fertilizers, especially the fertilizer efficiency analysis of indigenous fertilizers; ④ In fertilizer accumulation, advocate agricultural fertilizers as the mainstay, and at the same time develop indigenous fertilizer production; in agricultural fertilizers, vigorously develop pig raising for fertilizer accumulation, advocate accumulating human and animal manure, and seize the opportunity to accumulate compost and plant green manure.
    In order to solve the shortage of labor and transportation difficulties, in addition to improving fertilizer quality to reduce the transportation burden, the following measures have also been taken: ① Three circles to the field, composting fertilizer at the field head; ② Transporting fertilizer in advance during the slack season of agricultural work, transporting fine fertilizer in distant places, and transporting coarse fertilizer in nearby places; ③ Commune members bring fertilizer to the fields and bring grass home; ④ Reforming transportation tools; ⑤ Raising draught animals well to increase transportation power.
    (5) Combine regional characteristics and widely open up fertilizer sources. In addition to the universal accumulation of human and animal manure and the combination of summer composting of green manure, Shandong has universally opened up marine fertilizer and fish fertilizer in coastal areas; grass fertilizer can be accumulated in large quantities and mineral extraction and fertilizer production in mountainous areas; and there are large amounts of native miscellaneous fertilizer in the plains.

    山东层层建立各种肥料基点
    以点带面推动群众积肥运动
    本报讯　以点带面，层层设立标兵，山东省普遍设置积肥造肥工作基点，有力地推动了全省的积肥造肥运动。
    迅速积造又多又好的肥料，已成为夺取今年秋季作物更大丰收的关键。为此，山东省在广泛开展积肥造肥工作的同时，在全省范围内普遍建立了积肥造肥工作基点。截至6月中旬统计，全省有积肥造肥工作基点县十六处，平均每一个专区（市）有两处；基点公社一百六十处以上，平均每县有两处；大部分公社普遍做到有基点生产队一到两处。这些基点一般都是工作基础、群众觉悟较好的县、社和队，它们在积肥造肥方面都代表了不同的类型，具有不同的特点。从地形上看，有山区、平原、丘陵和沿海；从内容上看，有全面贯彻积肥造肥的典型，有养猪积肥的典型，有大搞土化肥的典型，也有贯彻积肥造肥政策的典型，这就在全省内形成了积肥造肥工作基点网。据初步摸索的经验来看，只要抓好基点网的工作，既可以开展基点的积肥工作，又可以通过基点网推动全民性的积肥造肥运动。目前各级党、政领导组织，正在充分运用这种工作方法，派专人深入基点了解和掌握情况，加强领导，培养它们成为积肥造肥工作中的旗帜，总结它们在积肥造肥工作中的经验，并通过不同形式推广这些经验。因而，积肥造肥工作基点成为当前各级党委推动群众性积肥造肥运动的有力助手。如聊城专区聊城市，由于突出地贯彻执行了中央和省委关于积肥造肥的政策，认真清理了去年社员的肥料投资，合理制定了肥料价格和积肥造肥报酬，恢复了饲料地，解决了养猪饲料不足和积肥中存在的具体困难，从而充分调动了广大社员积肥造肥的积极性，在短期内掀起了轰轰烈烈的群众性积肥运动，平均每亩施肥达六千斤左右。在聊城地委领导下，聊城市委总结了这一经验；山东省委已将该市的经验批转各地，及时地指导了各地开展积肥造肥工作，解决问题很大。
    各地基点根据肥源及作物需肥情况，制定了积肥造肥规划，具体安排了在不同时间内应积肥造肥的任务，并以夏季积肥造肥为中心，开展群众性积肥造肥运动。规划制定后，不少地区还发动群众进行讨论，结合贯彻了积肥造肥的“包”、“定”、“奖”等一套制度，使积肥造肥规划落实到可靠的基础上。
    从各地基点初步摸索的经验看，凡是开展积肥造肥工作较好的基点，主要抓住以下几个环节：
    （1）坚决贯彻积肥造肥各项政策，是开展群众性积肥造肥的首要关键。积肥造肥是一项群众性的工作，广大群众积肥造肥的积极性愈能充分发挥，积聚又多又好的肥料就愈有保证。各地经验证明，提高广大社员积肥的自觉性，除了加强社会主义思想教育之外，全面贯彻积肥造肥各项具体政策，是迅速开展群众性积肥造肥运动的一个决定性关键。
    （2）加强领导，制定规划，健全制度。
    （3）经常性积肥与突击性积肥相结合，集体积肥与社员家庭积肥并举。
    （4）提高肥料质量，解决运输困难。在提高质量方面，目前主要采取以下措施：①在政策上贯彻以质论价；②加强积肥中的技术指导工作，印发技术指导材料；③建立肥料化验室，对不同肥料进行肥效鉴定，特别是对土化肥的肥效分析；④在积肥中提倡以农家肥料为主，同时发展土化肥生产；在农家肥料中，大力开展养猪积肥，提倡积攒人畜粪尿，抓紧时机堆沤肥、种绿肥。
    为了解决劳力不足和运输困难，除提高肥料质量减轻运输负担外，还采取了：①三圈到田，地头沤肥；②在农活较闲季节提前运肥，远地运细肥，近地运粗肥；③社员下田带肥，回家带草；④改革运输工具；⑤养好耕畜，增加运输力量。
    （5）结合地区特点，广泛开辟肥源。山东各地除普遍可以积人畜粪尿，结合夏季沤绿肥之外，在沿海地区普遍开辟海肥、腥肥；在山区可以大量积草肥，采矿制肥；在平原有大量的土杂肥。
