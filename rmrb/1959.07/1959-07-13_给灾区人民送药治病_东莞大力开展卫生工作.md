Sending Medicine and Treating Illnesses to People in Disaster Areas
Dongguan Vigorously Carries Out Health Work

(Reported by this newspaper) In Dongguan County, Guangdong Province, health and epidemic prevention work in disaster areas is being vigorously carried out under the leadership of Party committees at all levels and with the support and assistance of relevant parties, in conjunction with the work of rebuilding homes and restoring production.

After the Guangdong Provincial Health Department dispatched a medical team of sixty-four people to the county, they formed a medical and epidemic prevention team with the local Party and government leadership, military medical and prevention teams, and local health personnel, and went to five heavily affected areas, including Changping, Qishi, and Zhongtang, to conduct condolences and medical rescue work.

From the end of June, when the water receded, the county conducted a study and deployment of health work in the disaster areas during the county Party committee's meeting of commune Party committee secretaries, requiring Party committees at all levels to take charge of health work, improve environmental sanitation in the disaster areas, protect the labor force, strive for a bumper harvest of late rice, and rebuild homes. Subsequently, on the evening of July 2, the county Party committee convened a telephone conference of commune Party committee secretaries, heads of cultural and health departments, hospital directors, heads of condolence groups, and medical team leaders, proposing to work hard for ten days to vigorously prevent and control existing diseases and control the occurrence of summer infectious diseases, requiring that medical and rescue work be carried out while doing a good job in epidemic prevention work in the disaster areas; focusing on environmental sanitation, clearing garbage, dredging ditches, draining stagnant water, building toilets, and strengthening the management of mosquito and fly breeding sites; for the living environment of the disaster victims, ensure good ventilation, moisture prevention, fire prevention, and carry out drinking water disinfection, typhoid fever vaccination, and other work, and comprehensively carry out health publicity and education to cultivate the people's health habits: do not drink raw water, do not eat rotten and unsanitary food, etc.

At present, the health campaign in heavily affected communes such as Liaobu and Changping has rapidly and comprehensively started, vigorously carrying out environmental sanitation in the disaster areas and launching a manure accumulation campaign. In terms of drinking water disinfection, the wells in the disaster areas have been successively dredged and disinfected, while canteens and collective units are disinfecting water tanks, and toilets and temporary toilets are being built to meet the needs of the people, and preventive vaccinations are being gradually carried out to protect the people's health. In addition to cooperating with the people in carrying out health work, the medical and prevention team conducts door-to-door visits and treatments. Once, the medical team received news of a critically ill patient in Liaobu, and they went through the water overnight to rescue him. The masses were very moved and said, "The Communist Party is really good. Not only do they arrange our lives very well, but they also send doctors to provide us with free medical care."

    给灾区人民送药治病
    东莞大力开展卫生工作
    本报讯　广东省东莞县灾区的卫生防疫工作，正在各级党委的领导和有关方面的支持帮助下，结合重建家园、恢复生产的工作，大力开展。
    广东省卫生厅派了一个六十四人组成的医疗队到达这个县后，就在当地党政的领导下和军队医防队、当地卫生人员组成医防大队，分赴长平、企石、中堂等五个重灾区，进行慰问、医疗救护工作。
    这个县从6月下旬开始水退起，在县委召开公社党委书记会议的时候，对灾区卫生工作也作了研究布置，要求各级党委必须把卫生工作抓起来，搞好灾区环境卫生，保障劳动力，大搞晚造大丰收，重建家园。接着县委又于7月2日晚召开公社党委书记、文教卫生部长、卫生院长、慰问团长、医疗队长的电话会议，提出苦战十天，大力防治现有疾病，控制夏季传染病发生，要求在搞好医疗救护工作同时，搞好灾区防疫工作；着重搞好环境卫生，清除垃圾，疏通沟渠，排除积水，修建厕所，加强蚊蝇孳生场所的管理工作；对灾民居住环境，要做好开窗通风，防潮、防火，以及开展饮水消毒，伤寒预防注射等工作，并全面开展卫生宣传教育，培养群众的卫生习惯：不饮生水，不吃腐坏不洁的食物等。
    目前寮步、常平等重灾区公社的卫生运动，已经迅速全面行动起来，大搞灾区环境卫生，开展积肥运动。在饮水消毒方面，灾区水井已经陆续清淘和进行井水消毒，食堂和集体单位则进行缸水消毒，普遍修建厕所和新建临时厕所，以满足群众需要，并逐步开展预防注射，保障群众身体健康。医防队除了配合群众搞卫生工作外，挨家挨户进行访问治疗。一次，医疗队接到寮步有危急病人的消息，他们就连夜涉水前往抢救。群众非常感动地说：“共产党真正好，不但很好地安排我们的生活，还派医生来为我们免费医疗。”（附图片）
