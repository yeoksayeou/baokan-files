Short Commentary:

    The "cleaning up the site and recovering materials" campaign carried out by the Beijing First Construction Company and the Fourth Construction Company at the Science Road construction site highlights a crucial aspect of the economy drive on construction sites and provides a very effective method.

    Construction sites have two main characteristics. First, they use a large amount of construction materials. The materials used on a construction site easily amount to tens or hundreds of tons. Because of the large quantity of materials used, waste can easily occur if attention is not paid. The second characteristic is outdoor work. Outdoor work requires better storage of materials. Otherwise, wind, sun, and rain will cause metal objects to rust, wood to rot, and other items to deteriorate. Regularly cleaning up the site and recovering scattered materials (including those that can be immediately used in the project) is an effective way to plug loopholes of waste on construction sites.

    Cleaning up the site and recovering materials is a cost-saving measure, but its benefits extend beyond just saving money. If materials are discarded everywhere, managers will lose track of them, and workers will find them obstructive. Regularly cleaning up the site and organizing materials in a well-organized manner will make the use of materials more rational. A clean and tidy construction site is also very convenient for construction and helps establish good production order. Cleaning up the site is also beneficial for preventing accidents and ensuring safe production.

    Cleaning up the site must involve the masses. The method used by the Beijing First Construction Company and Fourth Construction Company at the Science Road construction site to recover materials is:
  “Pick up things on the way to work, take things home after work, and clean up during spare time,” and “Don’t come empty-handed to work or leave empty-handed after work.” Just by bending down and reaching out on the way to and from work, over time, a large amount of materials can be recovered. Increasing production and practicing economy is a regular mass movement. First, everyone must participate, and second, it must be done anytime, anywhere. Only when everyone participates anytime, anywhere, can the results be significant and the effects be good. When everyone establishes the concept of cherishing state property, the movement to increase production and practice economy can be sustained and deepened step by step.

    Cleaning up the site is a good way to increase production and practice economy, and all construction sites can promote it. Now, the Beijing First Construction Company and Fourth Construction Company at the Science Road construction site have provided some good practices, and we hope that all construction sites can do the same.

    大家动手清理现场
    北京市第一建筑公司和第四建筑公司科学路工地开展的清理现场、回收材料的活动，对建筑工地开展节约运动，提出了一个非常重要的方面，提供了一个非常有效的方法。
    建筑工地有两个特点。一是使用大量建筑材料。工地所用的材料，动辄数十吨、数百吨。因为用的物资多，数量大，稍不注意，就容易造成浪费。第二个特点，是露天作业。露天作业，要求更好地保管物资。不然，风吹、日晒、雨淋，金属物品会生锈，木材要腐朽，其他物品也容易变质。随时清理现场，回收散落物资，（包括能够立即用到工程上去的），是建筑工地堵塞浪费漏洞的有效办法。
    清理现场，回收物资，是一种节约措施；但是它的效果还不仅限于节约这一点。物资随地弃置，管理人员心中无数，工人工作起来也会碍手碍脚。随时清理现场，把物资整理得井井有条，物资的使用就会更加合理；工地清清爽爽，干净利落，对施工也有很大方便，有助于建立良好的生产秩序。清理现场对防止事故、保障安全生产也有好处。
    清理现场，一定要发动群众。第一建筑公司和第四建筑公司科学路工地回收材料的作法是：
  “上班拣，下班带，业余时间清理”，“上班、下班不空手”。就在上下班的时候，就在这一弯腰、一伸手之间，日久天长，就回收了大量物资。增产节约，是经常性的群众运动，一要大家动手，二要随时随地。随时随地大家动手，成绩才大，效果才好。而人人都树立起爱护国家财产的观念，增产节约运动就能够坚持不懈，步步深入。
    清理现场是增产节约的一个好办法，一切建筑工地都可以推行。现在，北京市第一建筑公司和第四建筑公司科学路工地已经提供了一些很好的作法，我们希望所有的建筑工地都能这样做。
