Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 25th: Although the foreign ministers have not held a plenary session for two days, the frequent diplomatic activities in Geneva have not diminished. A series of talks have been held in the past two days to continue exchanging opinions.

What are they talking about? There is no official news about this, but judging from the remarks of Western delegation members quoted by local newspapers, the discussion is about the West Berlin issue.

News published by some newspapers gives reason to assume that the Western foreign ministers are trying to use this discussion method to brush aside the main issue of abolishing the outdated occupation status of West Berlin.

The proposals put forward by the Western countries on June 16th do not help to solve this task at all, because the proposal stipulates that the current occupation system in West Berlin be made permanent, so that the US, British and French troops there will maintain their current number indefinitely.

As everyone knows, the proposals of the Western countries on June 16 also included plans on these issues. They insisted that they were thus catering to the Soviet Union's demands to stop subversive activities in West Berlin against the German Democratic Republic and other socialist countries, and not to set up atomic weapons and rocket weapons in West Berlin.

Western propaganda puts these issues at the forefront, obviously thinking that this will enable people not to pay attention to the negative position taken by the United States, Britain, and France on basic issues, which creates serious obstacles to reaching an agreement.

Judging from press comments, even on the above-mentioned subordinate issues, the attitude of the Western countries is equally negative. For example, the representatives of these countries insisted in their speeches that they were catering to the Soviet Union's proposal not to set up atomic weapons and rocket weapons in West Berlin.

However, what do their proposals on this issue stipulate? It stipulates that the Western three countries’ troops in West Berlin can only be armed with conventional weapons. However, any objective observer has reason to ask such a question: Who can be fooled by this trick? What difference does it make if the atomic weapons and rocket weapons shipped by Western countries to West Berlin are not equipped for the troops of the United States, Britain, or France, but for the police force in West Berlin?

Today, local newspapers reported on the foreign ministers' meeting in a pessimistic tone. These newspapers said that the negotiations made no progress. However, who is to blame? Isn't it precisely the Western countries using evasive tactics to replace the genuine desire to reach an agreement on a mutually acceptable basis? The facts quoted by these newspapers prove that this is the case.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 25th: U.S. Secretary of State Herter visited West Berlin for six hours today to show the "determination" of the U.S. military to rely on this city for a long time to conduct the Cold War, and to support and encourage the increasingly isolated reactionary politicians in West Berlin.

West Berlin Mayor Brandt and Herter made remarks at the welcoming meeting that poisoned the atmosphere of the Geneva Conference. Brandt, who has always clung to the legs of the occupying forces, even demanded that the Geneva Conference not continue to discuss the West Berlin issue. Herter comforted him by saying that the West will insist on stationing occupying forces in West Berlin. The United States will not forget its "responsibility to Berlin," and the United States will never sign an "agreement in Geneva that is inconsistent with the Western allies' obligations to the free people of Berlin." Herter also said that "the West will never accept the Soviet Union's deadline for resolving the Berlin issue."

    外长们在会外讨论西柏林问题
    西方顽固坚持西柏林占领制度
    赫脱亲自到西柏林为冷战政客打气
    新华社26日讯　塔斯社日内瓦25日讯：虽然两天来外长们没有举行全体会议，但是在日内瓦频繁的外交活动仍然没有减少。这两天举行了一系列的会谈，继续交换意见。
    他们谈的是什么呢？关于这一点没有任何的官方消息，但是，从当地报纸引用的西方代表团人士的言论看来，讨论的是关于西柏林的问题。
    某些报纸所发表的消息使人有理由设想，西方国家的外长竭力想利用这种讨论方式把取消西柏林已经过时的占领地位这一主要问题抛到一旁。
    西方国家在6月16日提出的建议丝毫无助于这个任务的解决，因为这个建议规定使目前西柏林占领制度永久化，使得那里的美英法军队无限期地保持现有的人数。
    大家知道，西方国家在6月16日的建议中也包括了关于这些问题的方案。它们硬说，它们因而迎合了苏联这样的要求，就是停止在西柏林进行反对德意志民主共和国和其他社会主义国家的颠覆活动以及不在西柏林设置原子武器和火箭武器。
    西方的宣传把这些问题提到首要地位，显然是以为这样就能够使人们不去注意美国、英国和法国在基本问题上采取否定的立场，这种立场为达成协议造成严重的障碍。
    从报界评论看来，即使在上述从属性的问题上，西方国家的态度也同样是否定的。例如，这些国家的代表在他们的发言中硬说，他们迎合了苏联关于在西柏林不设置原子武器和火箭武器的建议。
    然而他们在这个问题上的建议规定的是什么呢？规定在西柏林的西方三国军队只能用常规武器武装。可是，任何一个客观的观察家都有理由提出这样一个问题：这种花招欺骗得了谁呢？如果西方国家运往西柏林的原子武器和火箭武器，不配备给美国、英国或法国的军队，而是配备给西柏林的警察部队，那又有什么两样呢？
    今天当地报纸以悲观的语调报道了外长会议情况。这些报纸说，谈判毫无进展。不过，罪过在谁身上呢？不正是西方国家用规避策略来代替在双方可以接受的基础上达成协议的真正愿望吗？这些报纸引用的事实证明情况正是如此。
    据新华社柏林25日电　美国国务卿赫脱今天到西柏林访问了六小时，以表示美国军队将长期赖在这个城市来进行冷战的“决心”，并且给日益感到孤立的西柏林反动政客撑腰打气。
    西柏林市长勃兰特和赫脱在欢迎会上发表了毒化日内瓦会议气氛的谈话。一贯抱着占领军大腿不放的勃兰特竟然要求日内瓦会议不要继续讨论西柏林问题。赫脱安慰说，西方将坚持在西柏林驻扎占领军。美国将不会忘记它“对柏林的责任”，美国决不在日内瓦签订一个“同西方盟国对柏林自由人民的义务不相符合的协议”。赫脱还说，“西方决不接受苏联关于解决柏林问题的期限”。
