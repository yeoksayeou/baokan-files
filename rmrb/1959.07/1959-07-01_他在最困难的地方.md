    He is in the most difficult place
    By our reporter Liu Fan
    I had been looking for Captain Chen of the electromechanical installation team at the Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station construction site for several days, but I kept missing him. This day, I went to the electromechanical installation team again, and the female technician flipped her two braids back and said mockingly, "You haven't found him yet? Hurry, he's gone to the Jiangcunbu sand and gravel yard." I rushed to the sand and gravel yard, where people said, "He left just two minutes ago, to the Ye Family Workshop to pre-assemble the turbine." So I climbed over mountains and ridges to the Ye Family Workshop. As soon as I got there, a young worker, Xiao Zhang, greeted me and said:
    "Are you looking for Old Chen?"
    "Yes, looking for Captain Chen."
    "He's crawling under the turbine!" He said, leading me through rows of towering penstocks, drilling under the turbine, but there was no one there. Xiao Zhang said embarrassedly, "What bad luck, he's gone again."
    "Ah, it's really difficult to find him." At this moment, I felt a little tired and sat down on a steel plate, blurting out this sentence impatiently.
    Xiao Zhang felt the same way. He said that he was transferred to work with Captain Chen, but for the first few days, he hardly saw him. He was very distressed at the time. He had come to learn from a model worker, but he hadn't even had a good look at him. Later, after several days, he figured out the trick and found him in one place."
    "Where?" I asked quickly.
    "In the most difficult place!" Xiao Zhang repeated: "This is the trick, you can be sure to find him in the most difficult place."
    From Xiao Zhang's conversation, I learned that this advanced worker was a person who specialized in dealing with difficulties.
    Chen Bin came to the Xin'anjiang construction site in 1956 and dealt with countless difficulties, large and small. Last year alone, he overcame numerous difficulties and improved the design in thirty-two instances. He reformed the sifter, increasing the production of sand and gravel from three thousand cubic meters to eight thousand eight hundred cubic meters in eight hours; he modified the propeller in the sand washing machine, solving the accident of broken blades that often occurred due to clogging of sand and gravel; he also changed the original four mobile belt conveyors into one fixed belt conveyor, increasing the output by more than double...
    "Have you heard about Old Chen seizing the machine from the flood?" Xiao Zhang talked about a thrilling story with relish:
    One night in March of this year, a torrential flood came with a storm, and the river water flowed at a speed of more than three meters per second. The storm rolled the river waves, like uninhibited lions leaping wildly in the heart of the river. Seeing that the belt conveyor on the trestle in the heart of the river was about to be washed away by the flood. At this critical moment, Chen Bin led eight young workers to appear in this storm. He knew how much loss would be caused to the entire project if the belt conveyor was washed away. Once the flood receded, without machines to produce, it would directly affect the progress of the power station project. He was anxious and shouted "Go." Everyone immediately buckled up their safety belts and took their wrenches, just like a commando team on the battlefield. The waves beat against the trestle, and the storm lifted the trestle. Chen Bin kept twisting the wrench in his hand. He looked down and saw that the flood was only a foot away from the trestle. He knew that if the flood rose again, the trestle would be washed away, and these nine people, along with the trestle, would be swept away by the flood. So, he immediately ordered everyone to "go ashore." The workers climbed ashore one by one. But what about Chen Bin? He did not go ashore, but continued to twist the wrench in his hand in the raging waves. When he unscrewed the last screw, the tractor that had been prepared on the shore started to move. He hugged the belt conveyor with all his strength, and he and the eighty-centimeter-wide, three-hundred-meter-long belt and four machines safely landed on the riverbank. As soon as Chen Bin came ashore, everyone rejoiced for his escape, and at the same time, they were very concerned about his health and wanted him to rest well. However, after a while, he ran away again, running to the machine that had just been dragged ashore to check the parts. Look, what kind of person is he!
    Speaking of this, Xiao Zhang had a lot more to say, when suddenly the work bell rang, Xiao Zhang stood up and repeatedly told me: "Go to the difficult place, you can be sure to find him." Saying that, he ran away in a puff of smoke.
    In this Xin'anjiang power station construction site, which is twenty miles around, people in every section are fighting in tense and arduous battles. Where is the most difficult place? Two days later, I finally found Chen Bin on the turbine installation site. He was lying under the turbine, laboriously waving his iron pliers, his face and body covered with oil, busy pre-assembling the parts. It is said that in order to rush the pre-assembly of the turbine, his sleeping time has been greatly reduced. But besides the bloodshot eyes, you can't see any trace of fatigue. He greeted me warmly. Before I could speak, he smiled and said, "I heard you've been looking for me for a long time. Now this work is more demanding, so I ran here." I asked him several times to tell me about his advanced deeds, but he just repeated the old saying: "I only did a little work that I should do."
    What kind of words can be used to praise Comrade Chen Bin's responsible spirit, hardworking style, and humble attitude? I can only say that this is truly the true color of a Communist Party member! (Attached picture)

### 他在最困难的地方

    他在最困难的地方
    本报记者　刘凡
    在新安江水电站建设工地上，我找机电安装队的陈队长好几天了，但老是碰不上头。这天，我又跑到机电安装队去，女技术员把两条小辫子向后一甩，取笑似的说：“你还没有找到，快去，他到江村埠沙石料场去了。”我赶到沙石料场，那里的人说：“他刚走两分钟，到叶家工场去预装水轮发电机去了。”随即我又翻山越岭到叶家工场去。一到那里，青年工人小张迎着我说：
    “你找老陈吗？”
    “是的，找陈队长。”
    “他爬在水轮机底下呢！”说着，他带我穿过一排排高耸入云的输水钢管，钻到水轮发电机底下，不料一个人也没有。小张怪不好意思地说：“真不巧，又跑了。”
    “唉，找他真困难。”这时我觉得有点累，一屁股坐在钢板上，不耐烦地冲出这句话。
    小张听着也大有同感，他说，我是调来和陈队长一起工作的，可是，初来的几天，几乎天天看不见他的影子。当时很苦恼。明明是来向劳动模范学习的，怎么连看都没有好好看看。后来隔了好几天，摸到了窍门，才在一个地方找到了他。”
    “在什么地方？”我连忙查问。
    “在最困难的地方呗！”小张重复地说着：“这是个窍门，在最困难的地方保险你能找到他。”
    从小张的谈话里，知道这位先进工作者原来是专和困难打交道的人。
    陈斌从1956年来新安江建设工地，和大大小小困难打交道不知有千百次，去年一年他战胜重重困难，改进设计就有三十二件。他改革了筛粉机，八小时内生产砂石料由三千方提高到八千八百方；他改装了洗砂机里的螺旋桨，解决了砂石料因挤塞而常发生的轧断桨片事故；他还将原来四台移动式的皮带输送机改为一条固定式的皮带输送机，提高产量一倍以上……。
    “老陈向洪水夺机器的事情你听说过吗？”小张津津有味地谈起一段惊险故事：
    今年3月的一个晚上，汹涌的洪水夹着暴风雨奔腾而来，江水每秒流速在三公尺以上，暴风卷着江浪，像放荡不羁的狮子在江心暴跳着。眼看横在江心排架上的皮带输送机就要被洪水冲走。在这千钧一发的时候，陈斌带着八个青年工人出现在这暴风雨中。他知道皮带输送机冲走了，对整个工程有多大的损失，洪水一退，没有机器生产，就会直接影响电站工程的进度。他心急如火，喊了一声“上”。大家立即扣上安全带、拿着老虎钳，就像战场上的一支突击队。波浪拍打着排架，暴风把排架掀起，陈斌不停地扭动手里的老虎钳。他向下一看，洪水离排架只有一尺了，他知道洪水再涨，排架就会被冲倒，这九个人连同排架就要被洪水卷走，于是，他立即命令大家“上岸”。工人们一个一个的爬上岸了。然而陈斌呢？却没有上岸，仍在惊涛骇浪里不停地扭动手里的老虎钳。当他解开最后一个螺丝的时候，岸上早准备好的拖拉机转动了，他用全身力气抱住皮带机，他和八十公分宽三百公尺长的皮带及四台机器安全无恙地登上了江岸。陈斌刚上岸，只听得“哗”的一声巨响，江心的排架被洪水冲倒，随即整个排架就给洪水卷跑了。老陈在江心里整整挨了四个钟头，他一上岸来，大家都为他的脱险而庆幸，同时，又十分关心他的健康，要他好好休息。可是，过不一会，他又跑掉了，跑到那刚才拖上岸的机器旁边，检查零件去了。你看，他是一个什么样的人呀！
    说到这里，小张还有许多话要说，忽然上班的钟声响了，小张站起来，再三叮嘱我说：“到困难的地方，保险你能找到他。”说着，他一溜烟的走了。
    在这方圆二十华里的新安江电站建设工地上，每一个工段的人们都在紧张而艰巨的战斗着，究竟那里是最困难的地方呢？过了两天，我终于在水轮发电机安装工地上找到了陈斌。他躺在水轮发电机底下，吃力地挥动着铁钳，脸上、身上沾满了油污，忙着预装机件。据说，为了突击预装水轮发电机，他的睡眠时间大大减少了。但是除了带有血丝的眼睛以外，再也看不到有半点倦意。他热情地迎着我。还没有等我开口，他就笑着说：“听说您找了我好久。现在这项工作比较吃重些，我就跑到这里来了。”我几次要他说点自己的先进事迹，可是他只是重复那句老话：“我只做了我应做的一点工作。”
    对陈斌同志这种负责的精神、艰苦的作风和谦逊的态度，能用什么样的词句来赞扬呢？我只能说，这真不愧是共产党员的本色！（附图片）
