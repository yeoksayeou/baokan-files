    Little Suolang
    Zhang Yongmei

    Little Suolang shook his kasaya, dust falling at his feet. The prayer beads hung around his neck, and with an iron hoe in his hand, the fifteen-year-old Suolang walked out of the temple gate painted with human skin, heading towards the green, fertile soil. The sunlight was dazzling, the birds sang without stopping, oh, the wind was so refreshing, and pearls flowed in the canal. In the wheat fields, there was a chorus of songs, and cars disappeared into the distance... How wonderful! The world is so vast, with flat roads everywhere! Little Suolang, looking back, his eyes blurred with tears: the dim butter lamp, the yellowed mud Buddha, was he really going to stay there until his skin dried up and his bones withered? Little Suolang, turning around, puffed out his chest, the bell behind him rang! Like two big stones, tripping his steps. The singing in the fields, it seemed to urge: Come on! Fifteen-year-old Suolang, come and join the labor force! Look at the flying eagle overhead, also greeting you! Little Suolang, raising his head, wiped away the tears from the corners of his eyes....

    小索郎
    张永枚抖一抖袈裟，脚下落满尘土，念珠挂到脖颈上，手拿一把铁锄，十五岁的小索郎，走出画着人皮的庙门，奔向绿色的沃土。阳光耀眼，鸟儿唱不住，风呀，多清爽，水渠里流着珍珠。麦田中一片歌声，汽车隐没在远处……多好啊！世界是这样广大，到处是平坦的大路！小索郎，回头望，泪眼模糊：惨淡的酥油灯，发黄的泥佛，难道真要在那里，直到皮干骨枯？小索郎，回转身，挺起胸脯，背后的钟声响了！像有两块大石头，绊住他的脚步。田野上的歌声啊，又像在催促：来吧！十五岁的小索郎，来参加劳动的队伍！你看头上的飞鹰，也在向你打招呼！小索郎，抬起头，揩去了眼角的泪珠……。
