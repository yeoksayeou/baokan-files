    Strengthen the Leadership of Special Dried Vegetable Production
    *People's Daily* Commentator

    Special dried vegetables among non-staple foods, such as daylily, wood ear, dried bamboo shoots, pickled mustard tuber, and shiitake mushrooms, are important sideline products in China's rural areas. They occupy a certain place in the daily life of the broad masses of people. The advantages of dried vegetables are: light weight, resistance to storage, and easy transportation. They are suitable for large construction sites, border areas, military needs, etc., and are also national export goods, with a large annual export volume. Last year, the export volume of only seven commodities such as wood ear, dried bamboo shoots, and daylily reached more than 160,000 dan, earning a large amount of foreign exchange for the country.

    After liberation, thanks to the attention of local party and government organizations, production has been developing year by year. In 1956, daylily increased by 175% and wood ear increased by 132% compared with 1949. However, the output tended to decline after 1957. For example, wood ear decreased by 60% in 1958 compared with 1956.

    The fundamental reason for the decline in production is that in the past two years, the broad masses of farmers have concentrated their main efforts on agriculture. It is, of course, very necessary to first solve the major agricultural products such as grain, cotton, and oil. When people concentrate their efforts on developing grain production and cotton production, they relax their efforts on these scattered and small non-staple foods. However, relaxing this production will not only affect farmers' income, but also affect the supply of certain non-staple foods for the people across the country, and will also affect the country's export trade.

    It is not difficult to change this situation. As long as we strengthen leadership, give play to the enthusiasm of the masses, adapt to local conditions, make overall plans, take overall consideration, and make practical arrangements, the production of these special dried vegetables will quickly recover and develop.

    The development of this production should implement the policy of giving equal importance to both public and private, and encourage commune members to engage in part of the special dried vegetable sideline production on the premise of not affecting collective production. In the development of this production, the dried vegetables whose production has been interrupted or relaxed in various places should be quickly restored. For example, the wood ear production in Yuanqu County, Shanxi Province, which has been interrupted for more than 30 years, has been restored after arrangements. Varieties that were not originally produced should be tried and manufactured. Zhejiang did not originally produce pickled mustard tuber and needed to import a large amount from Sichuan every year. After the successful trial planting in 1952, it can not only be self-sufficient but also support other places, becoming a new pickled mustard tuber production area in China. For dried vegetables and seasonings that do not occupy cultivated land, such as dried bamboo shoots, shiitake mushrooms, and mushrooms, we can try to produce as much as possible. It is promising to make full use of ditches, field ridges, wasteland, and plant more daylily, and use the front and back of houses to plant other dried vegetables. In terms of dried vegetable varieties, we must "pay attention to both coarse and fine" and "grasp both large and small." We must not only focus on popular goods but also famous products; we must not only focus on domestic products but also wild products. In this way, the varieties can become increasingly rich and diverse, and everything can be available.

    Currently, it is the peak season for the production or marketing of dried vegetables such as daylily, wood ear, and edible fungi. Commercial departments must comprehensively prepare for purchase, packaging, transportation, and external transfer, and conduct in-depth investigations to do everything possible to strengthen the purchase of these products, and promote the development of this production through purchasing and sales work. In remote areas with scattered special dried vegetables, commercial departments should also adopt the methods of visiting households, picking up goods at the door, and designated time and place for purchase to facilitate the masses. If the price is too low, it should be adjusted appropriately.

    The Central Committee has repeatedly instructed all localities to develop non-staple food production, and local party committees are grasping production and life with one hand. The enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers in engaging in non-staple food production is high. We should firmly grasp these favorable conditions, set sail with the wind, actively plan the production of special dried vegetables under the unified leadership of the local party committees, and fully promote the development of special dried vegetable production. We should strive to produce special dried vegetables with complete varieties, large quantities, and good quality in a not-too-long period of time to enrich the types of non-staple foods and meet the needs of the broad masses of people.

    加强特产干菜生产的领导
    本报评论员
    副食品中的黄花、木耳、笋干、榨菜、香菇等特产干菜，是我国农村的重要副业产品。在广大人民的日常生活中，占有一定地位。由于干菜的优点是：份量轻，耐贮藏，便于运输，在大型工地、边疆、军需等方面都很适用，而且还是国家的出口物资，常年出口量很多。去年仅木耳、笋干、黄花等七种商品即出口十六万余担，为国家换回了大量外汇。
    解放后，由于各地党政的重视，生产是逐年发展的。1956年比1949年，黄花菜增加了175％，木耳增加132％。但是，1957年后产量趋向下降，例如1958年比1956年木耳减少60％。
    生产下降的根本原因是近两年来广大农民集中主要力量搞农业。首先解决粮、棉、油等主要的农产品，这当然是十分必要的。在人们集中力量发展粮食生产、棉花生产的情况下，对这些分散的、小的副食品就放松了。但是放松这项生产，不仅要影响农民收入，也影响全国人民某些副食品的供应，也会影响国家的出口贸易。
    改变这种状况并不难，只要加强领导，发挥群众的积极性，因地制宜，全面规划，统筹兼顾，切实安排，这些特产干菜的生产就会很快地恢复和发展起来。
    发展这项生产应当贯彻公私并举的方针，鼓励社员在不影响集体生产的前提下，搞部分特产干菜副业生产。在发展这项生产中，各地中断、放松生产的干菜，要迅速着手恢复，像山西垣曲县中断了三十余年的木耳生产，经过安排就已恢复了。原来不产的品种要进行试种试制。浙江原来不产榨菜，每年需从四川大量调入，1952年试种成功后，不仅能自给，还能支援外地，成为我国新的榨菜产地。对于不占用耕地面积的干菜和调味品，如笋干、香菇、蘑菇等，可以尽量多搞。利用水渠、田埂、荒地、多种黄花菜，利用房前屋后种植其它干菜都大有可为。在干菜品种上，要“粗细并举”“大小一齐抓”，既要抓大路货，也要抓名产品；既抓家生的，也抓野生的。这样才能使品种日益丰富多采，应有尽有。
    目前正是黄花、木耳、食菌等干菜的生产或上市旺季，商业部门必须全面地做好收购、包装、运输、外调等准备工作，并深入调查摸底，千方百计地加强这些产品的收购工作，通过购销工作来促进这项生产的发展。在偏僻地区的零星特产干菜，商业部门还应该采用逐户串门、上门取货和划片定时定点的收购办法，以便利群众。价格偏低的，应予适当调整。
    中央一再指示要求各地发展副食品生产，各地党委正在一手抓生产，一手抓生活。广大农民搞副食品生产的情绪高涨。我们应该紧紧地抓住这些有利条件，乘风挂帆，在各地党委的统一领导下，积极地规划特产干菜生产，全力促进特产干菜生产发展。争取在一个不长的时期里，生产出品种齐全，量多、质好的特产干菜，充实副食品的种类，供应广大人民的需要。
