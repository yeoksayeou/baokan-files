The Power of the Commune is Great: Disaster Areas Take on a New Look
Significant Achievements in Production Self-Reliance in Yonghu Commune, a Heavily Affected Area in Guangdong
Under the leadership of the Party and with the support of all quarters, all commune members, after twenty days of hard work, have rapidly restored agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery: late rice seedlings have been planted, fruits are bearing heavily, pigs, chickens, ducks, and geese fill the pens, fallow land is being deeply plowed, seeds and fertilizers are fully prepared, and a great production movement striving to "recover two harvests from one harvest after the disaster" is flourishing.

Guangzhou, July 29th (from this newspaper) – In the twenty days since suffering a once-in-a-century flood, Yonghu People's Commune in Huiyang County, Guangdong Province, has seen a new look of vigorous development in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery. This is the preliminary result of the commune and its members giving play to their initiative and engaging in production self-reliance under the leadership of the Party and with the support of all quarters.

When this reporter recently visited the commune, I saw that in the fields of Daoyuan, Dantang, Diaoli, Longtang and other production brigades, some areas had already been planted with lush green rice seedlings. In the fields, groups of commune members were shouting at oxen plowing and harrowing, some were repairing dikes and transplanting seedlings, and others were rushing to plant sweet potatoes, vegetables, soybeans, sorghum, and millet. According to commune statistics, twenty days after the flood receded, all twenty-one production brigades in the commune had transplanted rice seedlings on more than 9,700 mu of paddy fields, and the planted area of sweet potatoes, miscellaneous grains, feed, soybeans, and peanuts was close to 10,000 mu. Several thousand mu of lychees, pineapples, longans, sand pears, and other fruits, after careful post-disaster care, are once again bearing abundant fruit. All eighteen livestock farms, forest farms, more than thirty bamboo ware processing factories, and six chicken, duck, and goose hatcheries, milk rooms, and paper mills of the commune and production brigades have gradually resumed production. Of the fifteen brick and tile kilns washed down by the flood, nine have been repaired and put back into production.

In June, most of the fields and villages of Yonghu Commune were submerged in floodwaters several feet to more than ten feet deep for several days and nights, and agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery suffered varying degrees of severe damage. Around June 20th, when the water receded, the commune members immediately faced serious difficulties in terms of livelihood and restoration of production. With the support and assistance of the Party and the state, the commune Party committee, while comprehensively arranging for the food and housing of the affected commune members, immediately led the commune members to launch a movement of production self-reliance and rebuilding their homes.

Under the unified leadership of the commune, from the commune to the production brigades and production teams, production plans for restoring agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery were formulated based on the principle of adapting to local conditions. The commune management committee promptly allocated more than 700 "May 1st" plows produced by the commune's farm tool factory and a batch of local fertilizers and miscellaneous fertilizers to the most needy and severely affected production teams; it also sent cadres to other places to organize various seedlings. In order to strive to achieve "recovering two harvests from one harvest after the disaster," the commune has expanded the planting area of late rice and sweet potatoes from more than 50,000 mu in the early season to more than 90,000 mu. More than a dozen production brigades that were heavily affected have also turned over the muddy layer of low-lying, waterlogged land and poor mountain pit land that have been abandoned for many years, preparing to repair water conservancy facilities, apply more fertilizer, and plant all of it with food crops.

Many severely affected production teams tried every possible means to solve the difficulty of insufficient seedlings of various crops. More than 7,000 jin of rice seeds of Longtang Brigade were buried in the water by collapsed bricks and tiles. More than 60 commune members followed the branch secretary, dived into the water more than ten feet deep, dug open the bricks and tiles, and salvaged all of the rice seeds. Six severely affected brigades salvaged more than 30,000 jin of rice seeds in this way. "Wherever the flood recedes, sow the seeds," and more than 10,000 mu of seedling land in the entire commune were replanted within a few days after the water receded. All forty-nine water conservancy projects damaged by the flood were quickly repaired. Although the silt brought by the flood and the soaked rice and peanut seedlings have already rotted into fertilizer in the fields, each production team also used more than ten methods such as accumulating, composting, making, burning, shoveling, digging, piling, and purchasing household fertilizer to accumulate and produce approximately 4 million dan of local miscellaneous fertilizers and local chemical fertilizers.

Each production team has also increased manpower to engage in animal husbandry and sideline production, earning more than 88,000 yuan in cash in the twenty days after the disaster, as funds for expanding reproduction. This is 18,000 yuan more than the highest monthly income from sideline occupations in May before the disaster. Each team in the entire commune has now raised more than 800 more pigs and more than 5,000 more poultry than in the early days after the water receded. The Beilian, Nanao, and other severely affected teams had 358 livestock sheds destroyed by the flood, but in a few days, the commune members repaired and built 304 more. Each brigade also paid great attention to helping commune members develop household sideline occupations.

In the comprehensive restoration of production, Yonghu Commune solved the difficulty of lacking various seedlings through internal adjustments, exchanges, and support between teams within the commune. The severely affected teams received more than 10,000 jin of sweet potato seedlings shortly after the water receded and propagated them in a timely manner. (Chen Rijing)

    公社力量大　灾区变模样
    广东重灾区永湖公社生产自救成绩显著
    在党的领导和各方面支援下，全体社员经过二十天苦战，农林牧副渔各业已经迅速恢复：晚稻插上秧苗，水果结实累累，猪、鸡、鸭、鹅满圈栏，丢荒地搞深翻，种子、肥料准备齐全，一个力争“灾后一造收回两造粮”的大生产运动正在蓬蓬勃勃发展中。
    本报广州29日电　广东省惠阳县永湖人民公社在遭受了百年未遇的水灾后的二十天，已出现了农、林、牧、副、渔各业生产蓬蓬勃勃的发展的新面貌。这是在党的领导及各方面支援下，公社和社员群众发挥主动积极性，进行生产自救所取得的初步成果。
    记者最近访问这个公社时，沿途看见稻元、淡塘、吊沥、龙塘等生产大队的田野，已有部分栽上了葱绿的秧苗。在田间，只见成群的社员吆喝着耕牛犁土、耙田，有的在修田埂、插秧，有的正在抢种番薯、蔬菜、黄豆和高粱、粟米等早熟作物。据公社统计，水退后二十天，全公社二十一个生产大队，已有九千七百多亩稻田插上秧苗，番薯、杂粮、饲料、黄豆、花生的种植面积，已接近一万亩。几千亩地的荔枝、菠萝、龙眼、沙梨等水果经过灾后的细心护养又结果累累。公社和生产大队所有的十八个畜牧场、林场、三十多家竹器加工厂和六个鸡、鸭、鹅孵化房、牛奶房、造纸厂都陆续恢复了生产。被洪水冲塌的十五座砖瓦窑，已有九座修建好，重新投入生产。
    永湖公社大部分田野和村庄，6月间曾连续几昼夜被淹没在几尺至一丈多深的洪水中，农、林、牧、副、渔各业都遭受了程度不同的严重损失。6月20日前后水退了，社员们立即碰到了生活上和恢复生产各个方面的严重困难。在党和国家的支持和帮助下，公社党委在全面安排受灾社员食、住等生活问题的同时，随即领导社员开展了生产自救、重建家园的运动。
    在公社统一领导下，从公社到各生产大队和生产中队，都根据因地制宜原则订出了恢复农、林、牧、副、渔各业生产的规划。公社管理委员会把公社农具厂、肥料厂生产的七百多张五一犁和一批土化肥、土杂肥，及时拨到最需要的重灾生产队去；又派出干部到外地组织各种种苗。为了力争实现“灾后一造收回两造粮”，公社已经把晚造水稻和番薯的种植面积，由早造的五万多亩扩大到九万多亩。十几个受灾较重的生产大队，都把丢荒了好多年的低洼积水地和山坑劣土田也翻起泥层，准备修好水利，多施肥，全部种上粮食作物。
    许多重灾生产队多方设法解决各种作物种苗不足的困难。龙塘大队有七千多斤谷种被塌下的砖瓦埋在水中，六十多个社员跟着支部书记潜到一丈多深的水底，挖开砖瓦，把这批谷种全部捞了起来。有六个重灾大队就是这样潜水捞回了三万多斤谷种。“洪水退出哪里，谷种播到哪里”，全公社一万多亩秧地，在水退后几天便补播完毕。四十九宗被洪水冲坏了的水利工程也很快全部修复。虽然洪水带来的淤泥和浸坏的稻苗、花生苗已经在田里沤成腐熟的肥料，各个生产队还用积、沤、制、烧、铲、挖、堆和收购家肥等十多种办法，积制了约四百万担土杂肥和土化肥。
    各生产队还增派人力大搞畜牧业和副业生产，灾后二十多天已收入现金八万八千多元，作为扩大再生产的资金。这比灾前副业收入最高的5月份全月收入还多了一万八千元。全公社各队现在已比水退初期增养了八百多条猪和五千多只家禽。北联、难澳等重灾队被洪水冲毁了三百五十八间畜舍，不几天社员们便又修复和新建了三百零四间。各个大队还十分注意帮助社员发展家庭副业。
    永湖公社在全面恢复生产中，通过公社内部队与队之间的调剂、交换和支援，解决了各种种苗缺乏的困难。重灾队在水退不久即获得了一万多斤番薯种苗，及时繁育。（陈日晶）
