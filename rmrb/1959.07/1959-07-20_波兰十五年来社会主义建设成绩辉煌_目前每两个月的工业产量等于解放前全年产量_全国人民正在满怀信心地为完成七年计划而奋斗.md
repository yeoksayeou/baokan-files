Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 19th: Poland has achieved brilliant successes in socialist construction over the fifteen years since its liberation. Currently, Poland's industrial output for almost every two months is equivalent to the entire year's output in 1938 before liberation. In these fifteen years, Poland has established dozens of new industrial sectors, such as shipbuilding, chemicals, automobile manufacturing, and aluminum production.

The achievements of fifteen years of construction demonstrate that Poland has transformed from a backward agricultural country into a socialist industrial country. In terms of the output of certain major industrial sectors, Poland has entered the ranks of advanced industrial nations.

Currently, Poland's coal mining volume ranks sixth in the world, and third in the world based on per capita calculation. Poland is one of the world's famous maritime nations, with its shipbuilding industry's output ranking eleventh in the world, and its ship exports ranking fifth in the world.

The growth of Poland's national income reflects the rapid development of Poland's national economy and the superiority of the socialist system like a mirror. Currently, Poland's national income has increased 1.7 times compared to pre-war levels, and 2.2 times based on per capita calculation. Even during the period of relatively rapid capitalist development at the beginning of this century, it took the United States twenty years and the United Kingdom forty-five years to achieve the same level of growth in national income as Poland.

Poland's socialist construction began on the ruins of severe destruction by the Hitler bandits. After the end of the war, Poland only took four or five years to restore its national economy, and began large-scale socialist construction in 1950.

Since the implementation of the Six-Year Plan in 1950, Poland has launched large-scale industrial construction, and new factories have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. In the past nine years, Poland has built more than 10,000 large and small industrial and mining enterprises, and expanded existing enterprises. The number of large factories with more than 1,000 workers has almost quadrupled compared to pre-war levels. In the past ten years alone, Poland has built more than 200 new large-scale enterprises.

Poland's major industries have made significant progress since liberation. Over the past fifteen years, Poland has built eight new coal mines, and five coal mines are under construction. Before the war, the output value of Poland's machinery manufacturing industry only accounted for 7% of the total national economic output value; currently, it has reached 20%, an increase of more than sixteen times compared to pre-war levels. In the past ten years, the total tonnage of ships built by the emerging shipbuilding industry has increased from 5,400 tons to 175,000 tons, an increase of more than thirty-two times.

Other heavy industrial sectors have also experienced tremendous growth. In 1958, Poland's electricity generation reached 23.9 billion kilowatt-hours, an increase of 5.6 times compared to pre-war levels; steel production reached 5.6 million tons, an increase of 2.6 times compared to pre-war levels; cement production reached more than 5 million tons, an increase of 2.9 times compared to pre-war levels; metal cutting lathes reached 21,000 units, an increase of 3.9 times compared to pre-war levels; the output of the chemical industry has increased particularly rapidly, and currently, Poland's chemical industry output is equivalent to nine times the pre-war level. While prioritizing the development of heavy industry, Poland has also achieved tremendous success in light industry. In 1958, Poland produced 898.5 million meters of cotton, wool, and silk fabrics, an increase of 220% compared to pre-war levels. In the period from 1950 to 1958 alone, 438,000 spindles were put into production. Currently, the number of shoe factories in Poland has reached sixty-five. Four tanneries, two woolen mills, two silk mills, and two shoe factories are about to be put into production recently.

The industrial development speed of People's Poland since liberation is beyond the reach of capitalist countries. 1950 was the fastest year of industrial development in Poland, with industrial production increasing by 27.7% in that year. During the initial stage of large-scale industrial construction from 1950 to 1956, Polish industry increased by 1.31 times. In the same period, French industry only increased by 53%, and Italy by 62%. In recent years, Poland has maintained a growth rate of 9% to 10% per year. Now, the entire Polish people are striving confidently and with great ambition to complete the Seven-Year Plan (1959-1965). (Attached pictures)

    波兰十五年来社会主义建设成绩辉煌
    目前每两个月的工业产量等于解放前全年产量
    全国人民正在满怀信心地为完成七年计划而奋斗
    新华社华沙19日电　波兰解放十五年来在社会主义建设中取得了辉煌的成绩。目前，波兰几乎每两个月的工业产量就等于解放前1938年全年的产量。在十五年中，波兰已经建立了造船、化学、汽车制造、制铝等几十个新的工业部门。
    十五年的建设成就说明，波兰已经从一个落后的农业国变成了社会主义工业国。拿某些主要工业部门的产量来说，波兰已经进入先进工业国的行列。
    现在，波兰的采煤量已占世界第六位，按人口平均计算则占世界第三位。波兰是世界有名的海洋国家之一，它的造船业的产量已占世界第十一位，而船舶出口量则居世界第五位。
    波兰国民收入的增长像一面镜子一样显示出波兰国民经济的迅速发展和社会主义制度的优越性。现在，波兰国民收入比战前增加了一点七倍，按人口平均计算比战前增加了二点二倍。即使在本世纪初资本主义发展还比较快的时候，要取得像波兰在国民收入增长方面的成就，美国就用了二十年，英国则用了四十五年的时间。
    波兰的社会主义建设是从希特勒匪徒严重破坏的废墟上开始的。战争结束以后，波兰只用了四、五年的时间就恢复了它的国民经济，并且从1950年开始了大规模的社会主义建设。
    自从1950年开始实行六年计划以来。波兰展开了大规模的工业建设，新的工厂像雨后春笋一般建立起来。在最近九年期间，波兰共兴建了一万多个大小工矿企业，并扩建了旧有的企业。一千人以上的大工厂比战前几乎增加了四倍。仅仅在最近十年期间，波兰新建的大型企业就有二百多个。
    波兰的主要工业在解放后取得了长足的发展。波兰十五年来共建成了八个新煤矿，有五个煤矿正在建设中。在战前，波兰的机器制造业产值只占国民经济总产值的7％，目前，则已占到20％，比战前增长了十六倍以上。在过去十年期间，新兴的造船业的造船总吨数已由五千四百吨增加到十七万五千吨，即增加了三十二倍以上。
    其他重工业部门也获得了巨大的增长。1958年，波兰的发电量达到了二百三十九亿度，比战前增加了五点六倍；钢产量达到了五百六十万吨，比战前增加了二点六倍；水泥产量达五百多万吨，比战前增加了二点九倍；金属切削车床达二万一千台，比战前增加了三点九倍；化学工业的产量增加得特别迅速，目前，波兰化学工业的产量相当于战前的九倍。波兰在优先发展重工业的同时，轻工业也取得了巨大的成就。1958年，波兰生产了八亿九千八百五十万米棉、毛和丝织品，这比战前增加了220％。仅仅在1950—1958年期间，就有四十三万八千只纱锭投入生产。目前，波兰制鞋厂的数目已达六十五个。即将有四个制革厂、两个毛织厂、两个丝织厂、两个制鞋厂在最近投入生产。
    人民波兰解放以来的工业发展速度是资本主义国家所望尘莫及的。1950年是波兰工业发展最快的一年，这一年工业生产增长了27.7％。在1950—1956年大规模工业建设的初期，波兰工业增长了一点三一倍。而在同一时期，法国工业只增长了53％，意大利——62％。最近几年，波兰仍然保持了每年增长9％到10％的速度。现在，全体波兰人民正在满怀信心、壮志焕发地为完成七年计划（1959—1965年）而奋斗。（附图片）
