Mechanics on a Wheat Stalk
    Wang Xieshan

    Wheat stalks are very useful. People use their hollow characteristics, flatten them, and weave them into many light and practical handicrafts, such as fans, cool hats, and so on. Some people even use them to drink beverages...

    But when people are using wheat stalks, have they ever thought about this question: How can such light, hollow wheat stalks bear wheat ears that are much heavier than themselves without lodging?

    Usually, many people think that when something is subjected to pressure, the load-bearing capacity of solid rods should be greater than that of hollow rods. When the rods are very short, this common-sense judgment is correct. But when the rods are thin and long, exceeding a certain limit, like wheat stalks, the situation is not so simple.

    According to calculations based on the theory of mechanics of materials, for two slender rods of the same length and area, the compressive bearing capacity of a hollow rod is more than twice that of a solid rod. Therefore, if we imagine replacing the upright hollow wheat stalk with a solid rod of the same cross-sectional area, the same length, and the same material, the solid rod would not be able to withstand the pressure of the wheat ear and would collapse.

    In nature, many plants are hollow, such as reeds and bamboo. Other examples include the bones of humans and animals, which are also hollow. This is just as Galileo, the founder of mechanics more than 300 years ago, said: "Human skills and nature are making full use of this hollow solid. This object can greatly increase its strength without increasing its weight."

    In engineering, people use this principle to make some tall pillars and some rods hollow. In machines, people widely use steel pipes and iron pipes to manufacture slender, pressure-bearing frames. Of course, this is done when the rods are thin and long. If the rods are thick and short, being hollow has no advantage.

    The load-bearing capacity of a wheat stalk is not only related to the shape of the cross-section, but also to the length of the stalk. According to the theory of mechanics of materials, the compressive bearing capacity of a slender, pressure-bearing rod is inversely proportional to the square of its length. If the length of the rod doubles, its compressive bearing capacity is only one-quarter of the original. Therefore, if the wheat stalk grows too long, even though it is still hollow, it will not be able to withstand the pressure of the wheat ear and will collapse. There is a farming proverb that says: "If the Qingming Festival floods the dog, one mu yields one dou; if the Qingming Festival floods the goose, one mu yields one shi." This shows that farmers have long understood that it is not good for wheat stalks to grow too tall ("floods the dog"). From a mechanical point of view, the shorter the wheat stalk, the greater its compressive bearing capacity, and the less likely it is to lodge. To make short and thick wheat stalks grow heavy and solid ears, this requires the efforts of agronomists.

    An article entitled "Anti-Lodging Expert - Liu Yingxiang" was published on the second page of the People's Daily on June 22nd. This article reported on the methods of Henan farmer Liu Yingxiang to prevent wheat lodging. The main method is to artificially press down the wheat stalks that are growing too fast during the peak growing season. After being pressed down, the wheat will automatically grow straight again after a few days, but lumps will grow at the place where it was frustrated, and the length of the wheat stalk will be shortened accordingly. After doing this twice, the length of the wheat stalk is shortened by about 18%, and none of these wheat stalks lodged. Therefore, the secret lies in: the length of the wheat stalk is artificially shortened, and its compressive bearing capacity is correspondingly increased.

    麦秆上的力学
    王燮山
    麦秆是很有用的东西。人们利用它中空的特点，把它压扁，编织成很多轻巧而实用的手工艺品，如扇子、凉帽等等。还有人利用它来吸饮料……
    但是人们在利用麦秆的时候，有没有想到这样一个问题：如此轻轻的空心麦秆，却能承受比它重得多的麦穗，而不倒伏呢？
    通常，很多人认为东西在受到压力时，实心杆件的承载能力应当比空心杆件大。在杆件很短的时候，这个常识的判断是正确的。但当杆件又细又长，超过一定的限度时，像麦秆那样，情况就不那么简单了。
    根据材料力学理论的计算表明，两根长度、面积相同的细长杆，空心杆的承压能力要比实心杆大两倍之多。因此假如设想把直立的空心麦秆用同样断面面积、同样长度和同样材料的实心杆来代替的话，实心杆将受不住麦穗的压力而倒伏。
    在自然界里，很多植物都是中空的，常见的如：芦苇、竹等；其他如人和动物的骨头都是中空的。这正如三百多年前的力学奠基人伽利略所说的：“人类的技艺和大自然都在尽情地利用这种空心固体。这种物体可以不增加重量而大大增高它的强度。”
    在工程上，人们利用这个道理，把一些高大的柱子和一些杆子都做成空心的；在机器中，人们广泛地用钢管和铁管来制造细长的承压的架子。当然这样做都是在杆件细而长的情况之下；如果杆件既粗且短，空心就没有什么优越性可言了。
    麦秆的承载能力不但和断面的形状有关系，而且和秆的长度有关系。一根细而长的受压杆，根据材料力学理论，它的承压能力和长度的平方成反比；杆的长度增加一倍，那么它的承压能力只及原来的四分之一。因此如果麦秆长得过长，虽然仍是空心的，它也会受不了麦穗的压力而倒伏。有句农谚叫做：“清明淹住狗，一亩打一斗；清明淹住雁，一亩打一石。”这说明农民们很早就懂得麦秆长得过高（“淹住狗”）是不好的。从力学观点说来，麦秆愈短，它的承压能力愈大，愈不会倒伏。要使短而粗的麦秆长出沉甸结实的穗，这就需要农学家们的努力了。
    6月22日人民日报第二版上登着一篇题为“防倒伏专家——刘应祥”的通讯，这篇通讯中报道了河南农民刘应祥防止小麦倒伏的办法。主要的办法就是在生长的旺季里，把长得过快的麦秆，用人工把它压倒。被压倒的麦子，经过几天以后，又自动地长直，但在受挫折的地方长起了疙瘩，麦秆的长度也就相应地缩短了许多。这样做过两次后，麦秆的长度缩短了约18％，这些麦秆都没有产生倒伏。因此，秘密就在于：麦秆的长度被人为地缩短了，它的承压能力就相应地有了增加。
