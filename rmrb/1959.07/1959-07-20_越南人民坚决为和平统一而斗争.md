    The Vietnamese people once waged a difficult and heroic eight-year war of resistance to win national independence and peace. In 1954, after the great victory of Dien Bien Phu, the Vietnamese people achieved a great victory at the Geneva Conference. The Geneva Conference recognized the independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the three countries of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.
    July 20, 1959 is the fifth anniversary of the Geneva Accords on Indochina.
    Over the past five years, the Geneva Accords have been implemented in Cambodia. The Royal Government of Cambodia's adherence to a policy of peace and neutrality has been praised by international public opinion. However, in Laos, due to the interference of US imperialism, the government of Phoui Sananikone, under the direction of the United States, recently abandoned the Geneva Accords and the agreement signed with the Lao Patriotic Forces, provoked the civil war in Laos, and created tensions on the border between the Kingdom of Laos and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    As for Vietnam, the Geneva Accords originally stipulated that the authorities of North and South Vietnam should hold consultations and hold nationwide general elections in July 1956 to achieve the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. For five years, the government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have strictly implemented the provisions of the Geneva Accords and have repeatedly proposed consultations to achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland, but these proposals have been rejected by the South Vietnamese authorities, causing one 20th of July after another to pass in vain.
    It has been five years, and Vietnam is still divided.
    In South Vietnam, US imperialism is increasingly importing weapons and military personnel. They are stepping up the organization, equipping, and training of Ngo Dinh Diem's army, expanding and building many military airfields, strategic highways, and military bases to prepare for a war of aggression. Ngo Dinh Diem implements a dictatorial policy, constantly arresting, torturing, imprisoning and massacring kind people who desire peace, unity, independence and democracy. The crime of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, who massacred more than 1,000 of the 6,000 patriots imprisoned in the Phu Loi concentration camp, 30 kilometers from Saigon, in one day, has aroused the anger of the people of the world. Immediately following this, countless acts of persecution, raids, and massacres occurred in South Vietnam. The "Law No. 10 of 1959" fascist decree formulated by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique also allows them to arbitrarily and openly kill people. In order to be able to engage in illegal and inhumane activities as they please, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique has tried every possible means to obstruct the International Commission from performing its supervisory and monitoring tasks in South Vietnam.
    While the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam pursues a policy of peace, independence, and democracy, promotes the increasing development of North Vietnam's economy and culture, and the people's living standards are constantly improving, in South Vietnam, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique serves the US policy of aggression and war preparations, causing South Vietnam's economy and culture to decline, and the South Vietnamese people to become increasingly impoverished.
    The activities of US imperialism in undermining the Geneva Accords are clearly the main obstacle to the peaceful reunification of Vietnam and a threat to peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia. Ngo Dinh Diem not only acts as the United States' lackey in South Vietnam, but also, under the direction of the United States, has repeatedly threatened the peace and neutrality of Cambodia. At present, they are also colluding with the Phoui Sananikone government of the Kingdom of Laos to undermine the Geneva Accords and provoke the civil war in Laos.
    The Geneva Accords are a victory for the people of Indochina, as well as a victory for the national independence movement and the world peace movement. For five years, the Vietnamese people from north to south have continuously opposed the interference of US imperialism and the dictatorial policy of Ngo Dinh Diem, who is dependent on the United States, and resolutely demanded the strict implementation of the Geneva Accords. This is not only for the cause of Vietnam's reunification, but also for the common cause of national independence and peace.
    This year, on July 20, the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Accords, the Vietnam Fatherland Front, the Vietnam Asian-African People's Solidarity Committee, and the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace jointly launched a large-scale movement to demand that US imperialism stop its acts of interference and immediately dissolve all US military delegations in South Vietnam; demand that the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities must stop all terrorist activities, dissolve all concentration camps, and hold consultations with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to restore normal relations between the North and South regions, and hold general elections in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords to unify the country; oppose US imperialism's interference in Laos and turning Laos into a US military base; and demand the convening of a high-level meeting to resolve urgent international issues to ease international tensions. This is the legitimate demand of the Vietnamese people today, and it is in line with the legitimate aspirations of the people of the world.
    According to the resolutions of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference and the Asian-African Solidarity Council, the Secretariat of the Asian-African Solidarity Council has designated July 20 of this year as "Vietnam Day" and called on the Asian-African people and the peace-loving people of the world to support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people. This is a valuable encouragement to the Vietnamese people and a practical action to strengthen the unity of the people of Asian and African countries to oppose imperialism, safeguard national independence and peace. The Vietnamese people express a warm welcome and gratitude to the Secretariat of the Asian-African Solidarity Council for this resolution.
    The Vietnamese people feel extremely excited and moved by the warm support given to them by the people of socialist countries, the people of Asian and African countries, and the peace-loving people of the world during the War of Resistance and since the restoration of peace. In particular, the Soviet Union and China played an important role in the struggle to win peace, independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity for Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos at the 1954 Geneva Conference. For five years, they have actively supported the implementation of the Geneva Accords and actively supported the Vietnamese people in their struggle to unify their motherland and build a prosperous new life in North Vietnam.
    Taking this opportunity, the Vietnamese people express their deep gratitude to our comrades, friends and international organizations who have consistently supported us.
    Peace, unity, independence, democracy and prosperity are the deep aspirations and goals of struggle of all Vietnamese people from South to North.
    The South Vietnamese people under the rule of the US-Ngo clique will never yield, despite suffering extremely brutal suppression. In South Vietnam, the struggle against the US-Ngo clique, demanding peace, unity, freedom, democracy and improved living standards is expanding and surging.
    The people of North Vietnam under the democratic regime directly led by the Vietnam Workers' Party headed by President Ho Chi Minh have always expressed their sympathy for the heroic South Vietnamese people and are striving to carry out the socialist construction competition as a solid foundation for the struggle for the reunification of the motherland.
    Vietnam is temporarily divided into two regions with different social systems. However, the Vietnamese nation and the Vietnamese state are one entity.
    The Vietnamese people know that, in the face of the US-Ngo clique's divisive conspiracy, the struggle for peace and reunification must still be long-term and arduous. However, based on their spirit of patriotism and love of peace and their brave and tenacious fighting tradition, the Vietnamese people have firm confidence in their final victory.

    越南人民坚决为和平统一而斗争
    越南保卫世界和平委员会副主席
    越南亚非人民团结委员会副主席  阮春水
    为了争取民族独立和和平，越南人民曾经进行了艰苦和英勇的八年抗战。1954年，在奠边府大捷之后，越南人民在日内瓦会议上取得了巨大的胜利。日内瓦会议承认越南、柬埔寨和老挝等三个国家的独立、主权、统一和领土完整。
    1959年7月20日是关于印度支那问题的日内瓦协议诞生的五周年。
    五年来，日内瓦协议在柬埔寨获得了履行。柬埔寨王国政府遵循和平中立政策而受到国际舆论的赞许。可是，在老挝，由于美帝国主义的干涉，培·萨纳尼空政府在美国的指使下，最近背弃了日内瓦协议和同寮国战斗部队签订的协议，挑起了老挝内战，制造老挝王国和越南民主共和国边境上的紧张局势。
    至于越南，日内瓦协议本来规定，北越和南越当局应进行协商，在1956年7月举行全国范围的普选，以实现越南的和平统一。五年以来，越南民主共和国政府和人民严正履行日内瓦协议的各项条款，一再提建议举行协商，以实现祖国的和平统一，但这些建议都遭到南越当局的拒绝，致使一个又一个的7月20日白白地消逝。
    已经五年了，越南仍被分割着。
    在南越，美帝国主义越来越多地运进武器和军事人员，他们为吴庭艳军队加紧进行组织、装备和训练工作，扩建和新建许多军用机场、战略公路和军事基地，来准备侵略战争。吴庭艳施行独裁政策，不断地逮捕、拷打、监禁和屠杀渴望和平、统一、独立和民主的善良的人民，吴庭艳集团一天之内屠杀了监禁在离西贡三十公里的富利集中营里的六千爱国者中的一千多人的罪行，已经激起了世界人民的愤怒。紧接着，在南越还发生了无数起迫害、扫荡和残杀事件。吴庭艳集团制定的“1959年第十号”法西斯法令，还容许他们任意地公开杀害人民。为了能够为所欲为地进行非法和惨无人道的勾当，吴庭艳集团对国际委员会在南越执行监督和监察任务加以百般阻挠。
    在越南民主共和国政府奉行和平、独立和民主的政策，促进北越的经济和文化日益发展，人民的生活水平日益提高的同时，在南越，吴庭艳集团却为美国的侵略政策和备战计划效劳，使南越的经济和文化日益衰落，南越人民日益贫困。
    美帝国主义破坏日内瓦协议的活动，显然是越南和平统一的主要障碍，也是对印度支那和东南亚的和平的威胁。吴庭艳不仅充当美国在南越的走狗，而且还在美国的指使下屡次威胁柬埔寨的和平和中立。目前，它们还同老挝王国培·萨纳尼空政府互相勾结以破坏日内瓦协议，并挑起老挝内战。
    日内瓦协议是印度支那人民的胜利，同时也是民族独立运动和世界和平运动的胜利。从北至南的越南人民五年来不断地反对美帝国主义的干涉，反对吴庭艳依附美国的独裁政策，坚决要求严正履行日内瓦协议。这不仅是为了越南的统一事业，也是为了共同的民族独立事业和和平事业。
    今年7月20日，即日内瓦协议签订五周年到来的时候，越南祖国战线、越南亚非人民团结委员会、越南保卫世界和平委员会联合发动了大规模的运动，来要求美帝国主义停止干涉行动和立即解散在南越的所有的美国军事代表团；要求吴庭艳当局必须停止一切恐怖行动、解散所有的集中营、同越南民主共和国政府进行协商以恢复北南两地区的正常关系，按照日内瓦协议的规定来举行普选以统一国家；反对美帝国主义干涉老挝，把老挝变成美国的军事基地；要求召开高级会议，解决迫切的国际问题以缓和国际紧张局势。这是越南人民当前的正当要求，它符合世界人民的正当愿望。
    亚非团结理事会书记处根据亚非人民团结大会和亚非团结理事会的决议，以今年的7月20日作为“越南日”，并号召亚非人民和世界爱好和平人民支持越南人民的正义斗争。这是对越南人民的可贵的鼓舞，也是加强亚非各国人民的团结以反对帝国主义、维护民族独立和和平的实际行动。越南人民对亚非团结理事会书记处的这项决议表示热烈的欢迎和感激。
    越南人民对于社会主义各国人民、亚非各国人民和世界爱好和平人民在抗战期间和和平恢复以来所给予他们的热烈支持，感到无比的兴奋和激动。特别是苏联和中国，它们在1954年日内瓦会议上争取越南、柬埔寨和老挝的和平、独立、主权、统一和领土完整的斗争中起了重要的作用。五年来，他们又积极支持日内瓦协议的实施、积极支持越南人民争取统一祖国和在北越建设繁荣的新生活。
    趁这个机会，越南人民对于一贯支持我们的同志们、朋友们和各个国际组织表示深切的感谢。
    和平、统一、独立、民主和繁荣是从南到北的全体越南人民的深切的愿望和奋斗的目标。
    在美吴集团统治下的南越人民，尽管遭受着极其残酷的镇压，但他们永远不会屈服的。在南越，反对美吴集团、要求和平、统一、自由、民主和改善生活的斗争正在日益扩大和高涨着。
    在以胡志明主席为首的越南劳动党所直接领导的民主政体下的北越人民，始终对英勇的南越人民表示同情，并努力进行建设社会主义的竞赛以做为争取统一祖国的斗争的稳固基础。
    越南暂时被分裂为具有不同社会制度的两个地区。可是，越南民族和越南国家是一个整体。
    越南人民知道，面对着美吴集团的分裂阴谋，争取和平和统一的斗争还必须是长期和艰苦的。可是，本着自己爱国爱和平的精神和勇敢坚韧的斗争传统，越南人民对自己的最后胜利，抱着坚定的信心。
