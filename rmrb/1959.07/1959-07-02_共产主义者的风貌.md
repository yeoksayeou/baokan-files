    The Demeanor of a Communist
    Lin Ling

    Ten years ago, when the workers of Sofia lined up to bid farewell to their leader, they kept repeating, "Dimitrov is not dead." Indeed, Dimitrov is not dead. Ten years have passed, and the radiant image of Comrade Dimitrov still vividly appears before us.

    Lenin wrote a letter to Stasova and the comrades in Moscow prison in 1905, talking about arrested revolutionaries, who should not simply resist the court. Except when it is necessary to protect themselves and the organization, and not admit membership in any organization, when possible, they should declare their views, lecture on revolutionary principles, and conduct propaganda beneficial to the Party. "In any case, talking about the principles, program, and tactics of social democracy, talking about the workers' movement, talking about socialist goals, talking about uprisings - this is the most important."

    It was based on Lenin's instruction that Dimitrov displayed the great demeanor of a communist in the Leipzig court.

    In order to crush their most formidable enemy at the time—the powerful German Communist Party—and to maliciously slander the Communist International and the Soviet government, the German fascists fabricated the so-called "Reichstag fire," arrested German Communist Party leader Thalmann and Dimitrov, the representative of the Communist International stationed in Germany, and other comrades, accusing them of being "arsonists." After careful preparation and training a group of false witnesses, the fascists held a sensational public trial at the Leipzig Supreme Court, allowing reporters from various countries to attend and listen so that they could quickly spread the full news of Hitler's successful conspiracy around the world.

    Contrary to the fascists' expectations, what was spread to the world was not the news of Hitler's conspiracy's victory, but the news of Dimitrov's victory in exposing fascist lies. Because Dimitrov, relying on his profound mastery of Marxist-Leninist theory, the fearless spirit of a communist fighter, and the Bolshevik's rich experience in struggle against the enemy, used the enemy's court as a platform to conduct communist propaganda. With witty and powerful questions, he refuted all the judge's interrogations, turning the defendant into the plaintiff and the plaintiff into the defendant. Dimitrov solemnly declared that he was a communist, an Executive Committee member of the Communist International. Precisely because he was a communist, he was not an arsonist, because communists never advocate the use of terrorist means; only fascists are accustomed to such tricks.

    Dimitrov's unyielding and heroic struggle showed the world the noble demeanor of a communist. The enemy was subdued, and he was declared not guilty and released. Dimitrov defended not himself, but communism and the Communist International. His victory not only protected his own life but also protected the reputation of the Communist International and the Soviet Union. This was a victory of the world proletariat over the bourgeois fascists.

    Dimitrov profoundly mastered Marxism-Leninism; he was a theorist and a practical worker. His special temperament made him a revolutionary leader. He was not only a revolutionary leader of Bulgaria but a revolutionary leader on a world scale. As a representative of the Communist International, he bravely and resourcefully, with both theory and experience, directly led revolutionary activities in many European countries. The united front strategy he pioneered and the theory of people's democratic dictatorship he expounded are of great significance to Marxist-Leninist doctrine.

    Dimitrov's revolutionary demeanor was also manifested in his attitude towards people. He not only made great efforts in cultivating cadres for the international communist movement, but he also gave sincere assistance to revolutionary comrades from various countries, especially to those who were in trouble, sick, or impoverished. His home was often inhabited by the aforementioned "guests," and he often fostered orphans of revolutionary fighters. When Comrade Liu Ningyi visited Dimitrov in Sofia in 1947, he saw that he was fostering a Chinese girl who had lost her parents.

    Our friend of the Chinese people, the great internationalist Dimitrov, has left us for ten years, but his great communist demeanor will live in our hearts forever.

    共产主义者的风貌
    林陵
    十年前，索非亚的工人列着队去和自己的领袖告别时，嘴里不住地念叨着：“季米特洛夫没有死”。确实季米特洛夫没有死。十年过去了，季米特洛夫同志的光辉形象还栩栩如生地闪现在我们的面前。
    列宁曾在1905年写信给斯达索娃和莫斯科狱中的同志们，谈到被捕的革命者，不应该单纯抵制法庭，除了有时必须保护自己和保护组织，不承认自己是哪个组织的成员外，在有可能时，应当宣述自己的观点，演讲革命道理，进行有利于党的宣传。“无论如何，谈社会民主党的原则、纲领和策略，谈工人运动谈社会主义目的，谈起义——这是最重要的。”
    季米特洛夫就是根据列宁的这一指示，在来比锡法庭上显示了伟大的共产主义者的风貌。
    德国法西斯蒂为了把他们当时最可怕的敌人——强大的德国共产党打垮，并且恶毒地污蔑当时共产国际和苏联政府，制造了所谓“国会纵火案”，逮捕了德国共产党领袖台尔曼和共产国际驻在德国的代表季米特洛夫等同志，控告他们是“纵火犯”。经过周密的准备，训练好一批假证人，法西斯蒂在来比锡最高法院举行轰动全世界的公审，他们允许各国记者出席旁听，以便把希特勒阴谋得逞的全部消息，迅速传播全世界。
    出于法西斯蒂的意料之外，传布到全世界去的，不是希特勒阴谋取得胜利的消息，而是季米特洛夫揭露法西斯谎言取得胜利的消息。因为季米特洛夫凭着他马克思列宁主义理论的高深修养，共产主义战士的无畏精神，布尔什维克对敌斗争的丰富经验，利用敌人法庭的讲台，进行了共产主义的宣传。他用机智有力的反问，驳倒了法官的全部讯问，把被告变成原告，把原告变成被告。季米特洛夫严正地宣称，他是共产主义者，是共产国际的执行委员，正因为是共产主义者，所以他不是纵火犯，因为共产党人从来不主张采用恐怖手段，只有法西斯蒂才惯用这种伎俩。
    季米特洛夫的不屈不挠的英勇斗争，向全世界人民显示了共产主义者的崇高风貌。敌人被制服了，他被宣布无罪释放。季米特洛夫不是为自己，而是为共产主义和共产国际辩护，他取得的胜利，不仅保卫了自己的生命，也保卫了共产国际和苏联的声誉。这是全世界无产阶级对资产阶级法西斯蒂的胜利。
    季米特洛夫深刻掌握马克思列宁主义，他是理论家，又是实际工作者，他的特殊气质，使他成为革命领袖。他不是保加利亚一国的革命领袖，而是世界范围的革命领导者。他曾作为共产国际的代表，勇敢而有机智地、有理论也有经验地直接在欧洲好多国家领导革命活动。他所创导的统一战线策略，他所阐述的人民民主专政的理论，对马克思列宁主义学说具有重大意义。
    季米特洛夫的革命风貌还表现在他待人接物的态度上。他不仅在培养国际共产主义运动的干部方面，尽了很大力量，他在帮助各国革命同志方面，特别是对于遭难、生病、闹穷的同志，给予真诚的援助。他家里经常住着上述的“客人”，经常抚育着革命战士的孤儿。刘宁一同志1947年到索非亚去访问季米特洛夫时，就看见他家里抚养着没有父母的中国女孩。
    中国人民的朋友、伟大的国际主义者季米特洛夫离开我们十年了，但他的伟大的共产主义者的风貌却将永久活在我们心里。
