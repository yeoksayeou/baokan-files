    The Common Voice of the Whole Nation
    By Vietnamese Writer Ruan Wenfeng
    In North Vietnam, each day brings a new joy. Each New Year marks a great stride forward on our path to happiness. At such times, when we look at South Vietnam today, each day that passes adds a measure of suffering, and each year accumulates more hatred.
    Today, the northern and southern regions of Vietnam remain divided. Under the same Vietnamese sky, the North and South live two vastly different lives. The North celebrates a bumper harvest, while the South suffers a crop failure; the famine in the South is not limited to the central provinces but even extends to the supposedly rich "granary" of the South. In the North of the Republic, one factory is expanded, and then a new one is built, with each factory vying to overfulfill the state plan; in the South, the original factories are closing down one after another under the flood of American "aid" goods, workers are unemployed, and industrialists are bankrupt. Farmers are forced to tear down their houses to build strategic highways for the Americans and abandon their fields to build "land reclamation zones" for military purposes. In the North, the people of the capital, Hanoi, happily fill in the muddy ditches of the Seven Acres Lake, building parks, sports fields, children's playgrounds, and nursing homes; but in the South, the superficially prosperous city of Saigon is crowded with starving, homeless, and jobless people, and even children have learned American-style robbery, murder, and lewdness… It is truly heartbreaking.
    Therefore, every effort that brings North and South Vietnam into contact, that brings about the early reunification of Vietnamese territory, is warmly welcomed and responded to by every person in Vietnam and by peace-loving people around the world. Our government has repeatedly written to the South Vietnamese regime, suggesting that the responsible authorities of both sides meet to discuss issues related to military affairs, economy, propaganda, and exchanges between the two regions. This spirit is the spirit of peaceful construction of the motherland, the spirit of hoping that the two regions will work together to develop the economy and culture, to do everything possible to establish the will of national unity, to cultivate the determination to strive for the reunification of the motherland, and to pave the way for the restoration of normal relations between the two regions.
    American imperialism is opposed to this spirit. They are clinging to South Vietnam, trying to turn it into a hotbed of war, dragging South Vietnam's economic undertakings onto the path of suffocation, pushing South Vietnam's cultural undertakings to a dark and degenerate place, hindering the reunification of Vietnamese territory, hindering the exchanges between North and South Vietnam, hindering the reunion of husbands and wives, parents and children, and even making things difficult for every postcard…
    But in the land of Vietnam, the final wish is the wish of the Vietnamese people, the wish for a unified motherland!
    Vietnamese writers will use their pens and all their strength to express this wish of the Vietnamese people. Vietnamese writers will, together with people from all walks of life, wage a struggle to demand that the South Vietnamese authorities break free from the shackles of American imperialism, so that the literature and art of the two regions can speak with a common voice of the whole nation – the voice of peace and unity.

    全民族共同的声音
    越南作家　阮文俸
    在越南北方，每一天的到来，都增加了一种新的喜悦。每一个新年的来临，都表示着我们在幸福的道路上向前迈进了一大步。在这样的时候，我们再看一下今天的越南南方，增加一天就是增加了一分痛苦，增加一年就是多积压了仇恨。
    如今，越南的北、南两个地区还是被分割着。在同一个越南的天空下，北方和南方却过着两种截然不同的生活。在北方大庆丰收，在南方却歉收；南方的饥荒不仅限于中部各省，而且甚至遍及南部这个素称富饶的“谷仓”。而在共和国的北部，这个工厂扩建了，那个新的工厂接着又兴建起来，各个工厂竞相超额完成国家计划；南方却在美国“援助”货物的泛滥下，原有的工厂相继倒闭，工人失业，工商业家惨遭破产。农民被迫拆毁房屋来为美国佬修建战略公路，抛弃自己的田园去建筑带有军事目的的“垦荒区”。在北方，首都河内的人们兴高采烈地填平了七亩湖的污泥沟，建筑起公园、运动场、儿童游乐场、养老院等；可是在南方，表面上繁华的西贡市，却拥挤着饥馑的、无家可归、无业可就的人们，甚至小孩子也学会了美国式的抢劫、杀人和淫荡……实在是令人无限痛心。
    因此，所有一切使越南北、南两方相接触、使越南的国土早日统一的每一种努力，都得到越南国内的每一个人和世界上爱好和平的人民的热烈欢迎和响应。我们的政府一再写信给南越政权，建议双方负责当局会晤，以便商谈有关军事、经济、宣传和两个地区间的交往等问题。这种精神是和平建设祖国的精神，是希望两个地区共同努力发展经济和文化，竭尽全力来树立民族团结的意志的精神，是培养争取祖国统一的决心的精神，并且是为两个地区恢复正常关系开辟道路的精神。
    美帝国主义是反对上述这种精神的。他们正在死赖在越南南方，要把越南南方变成战争的火炉，把越南南方的经济事业拖上窒息的道路，把越南南方的文化事业推向黑暗、堕落的去处，阻挠越南国土的统一，阻挠越南北、南两个地区间的来往，阻挠夫妻、父母和子女们的团聚，甚至对每一张明信片也百般刁难……
    但是在越南国土上，最后的愿望是越南人民的愿望，是统一祖国的愿望！
    越南作家将用自己的笔尖和一切力量来表达出越南人民的这个愿望。越南作家将同各阶层人民一道，为要求南越当局摆脱美帝国主义的束缚而展开斗争，使两个地区间的文学艺术都说出全民族共同的声音——和平、统一的声音。
