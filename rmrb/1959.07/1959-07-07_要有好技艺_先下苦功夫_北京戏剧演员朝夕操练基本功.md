To Have Good Skills, First Put in Hard Work
Beijing Opera Actors Practice Basic Skills Day and Night

    (Our report) Midsummer finds the Beijing theatrical scene displaying a vibrant and flourishing atmosphere. No matter which theater troupe you visit, you'll find active scenes of people practicing with spears and swords, and rehearsing vocal techniques, with a prevailing atmosphere of diligently practicing basic skills.
    Through the great debate on improving artistic quality and the observation performances in May, many actors deeply felt the need for consistent, painstaking practice over the years. Every move and gesture should be carefully considered and meticulously crafted over a long period. Only then can stage performances beautifully and accurately express the characters' thoughts and feelings. Those working in opera music and stage art should also have regular basic training. Therefore, many famous actors, despite already possessing deep foundations and certain specialties, are still striving to improve on their existing foundations. The famous "painted face" actor Yuan Shihai has placed his practice equipment in the rehearsal hall. Every day, he practices "positive flying kicks," "reverse flying kicks," and technically demanding "single falls" and "double falls." He kicks his legs more than a hundred times each session, always working up a full sweat.
    Young actors also recognize that practicing basic skills is primarily for inheriting traditional arts, laying the foundation for singing, recitation, acting, and combat, and then improving on that solid foundation. Actors in the Beijing Hebei Bangzi Opera Troupe's training class, whether they are learning civil or martial roles, all start with basic skills every day. They diligently practice step by step, following the old artists' teachings of every word and every move, and following the prescribed order, demanding that their body movements and singing styles meet the basic requirements of traditional art.
    Old artists selflessly pass on their specialty skills and unique techniques to young actors. Liu Binsheng, a "somersault king" in his fifties at the China Peking Opera Theater, teaches the secrets of flipping somersaults, bit by bit, to young martial arts actors, so that when they flip, they can be as high, light, beautiful, accurate, and stable as the "somersault kings" of the past. Xi Cailian and Xi Caichun, veteran actors of the China Pingju Opera Theater, are familiar with many beautiful arias in Pingju Opera and have recently been teaching them carefully to young actors such as Gan Ping and Xiao Yushuang.
    Various drama troupes are also trying every means to strengthen the basic training of their actors. In the rehearsal hall of the Beijing People's Art Theater, one can see many actors practicing ballet, "fighting with weapons," and other physical movements every morning. Late at night, some actors, back in their dormitories, still use watches or pens to guide their eyes to move up, down, left, and right, or practice seven ways of looking (see, perceive, gaze, observe, glance, flit, vague) according to Gai Jiaotian's experience. Some actors specifically practice their tongues and lips trembling in front of a mirror.
    In order to ensure that actors practice their basic skills well, the leaders of each unit try their best to create favorable conditions for them. The daily schedule has been readjusted to comprehensively arrange performance, rehearsal, practice, study, and rest time. (Zhi Jiewen) (With picture)

### 要有好技艺　先下苦功夫  北京戏剧演员朝夕操练基本功

    要有好技艺　先下苦功夫
    北京戏剧演员朝夕操练基本功
    本报讯　仲夏，北京剧坛呈现着一片朝气蓬勃的景象。无论到哪个剧团，到处是舞枪弄剑、练腔调嗓的活跃场面，已有苦练基本功之风。
    各单位通过提高艺术质量的大辩论和5月份的观摩演出，许多演员深切地感到必须长年累月刻苦练功，一招一式都经过长期捉摸、精雕细刻，舞台上的一举一动才能优美、精确地表现出人物的思想感情；戏曲音乐、舞台美术工作者也应有经常的基本训练。因此，许多著名演员虽然都有较深厚的功底和一定的专长，但是仍然在原有基础上锐意精进。著名架子花脸袁世海把练功用具放在排演场里，每天练“正飞脚”、
  “反飞脚”、和技术性强的“单?子”、“双?子”，光是踢腿就要踢一百多下，每次都练得满身大汗。
    青年演员也认识到练基本功首先是为了继承传统艺术，奠定唱、念、做、打的基础，再在踏实的基础上提高。北京河北梆子剧团学习班的演员，每天练功时不论文戏或武戏，演员一律都从基本功开始，依照老艺人教的一字一句，一招一式，按步就班地苦练，要求身段唱腔都符合传统艺术的基本要求。
    老艺人们无私地把自己拿手的专长和绝技传授给青年演员。中国京剧院五十多岁的“跟斗大王”刘斌升把翻跟斗的窍门，一点一滴地教给了年青的武工演员，要让他们翻起跟斗来也能和当年舞台上的“跟斗大王”一样高、飘、美、准、稳。中国评剧院老演员喜彩莲、喜彩春熟悉评剧中的许多优美唱腔，最近也在一板一眼地教给年青演员干萍、小玉霜等。
    各个话剧团体也在千方百计地加强演员的基本训练。在北京人民艺术剧院的排演厅里，每天早晨就可以看见许多演员在练芭蕾舞、“打把子”等各种形体动作；深夜，有些演员回到宿舍里，还要顺便用手表或钢笔引着眼睛上下左右转动，或者按照盖叫天的经验练习七种眼睛的看法（看、见、瞧、观、瞟、飘、渺）。有的演员要对着镜子专门练舌头、嘴皮子打颤。
    为了保证演员练好基本功，各单位的领导上尽量设法为演员们创造便利条件。作息时间都重新作了调整，全面安排了演出、排戏、练功、学习和休息时间。　（智结纹）（附图片）
