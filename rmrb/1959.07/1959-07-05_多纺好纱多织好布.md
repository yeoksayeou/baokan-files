    Spin More Good Yarn, Weave More Good Cloth
    (Reported by our newspaper) Since the launch of the production increase and thrift campaign centered on improving product quality in the second quarter, the quality of cotton yarn and cotton cloth nationwide has generally improved in the cotton textile industry. For example, the first-grade product rate for cotton cloth entering the warehouse in Shaanxi Province increased from 84.67% in January to 97.04% in May, and in Shanghai from 87.51% to 95.81%.
    In order to improve product quality, textile departments in various regions mobilized the masses to conduct a comprehensive inspection of quality issues. Textile industrial departments in Hebei, Shaanxi, Beijing, Shenyang, and other places convened five-level cadre meetings, conducting extensive and in-depth "airing of views, debates, and discussions" focused on improving quality, reducing waste, and carrying out the production increase and thrift campaign. By presenting facts, meticulously calculating accounts, identifying root causes, and devising solutions, the broad masses of workers gained a profound understanding of improving quality. In April, the Shanghai Textile Industry Bureau organized various companies and 495 factories to conduct self-inspections and mutual inspections of the quality of 24 major categories of products, listened to the opinions of commercial departments, consumers, and cooperating factories, and held quality exhibitions. They vigorously exposed shortcomings in quality and actively relied on the masses to research improvements, achieving significant results. Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mill No. 2, using a combination of top-down, left-right, and internal-external methods, conducted a comprehensive inspection of quality and disclosed the requirements for improving quality to the masses. The masses put forward the slogan "Everyone guards the quality checkpoint, no substandard goods are allowed to escape, everyone works together on the four checkpoints (inspection, technology, operation, and cleaning work), and improves quality to pass the test," quickly forming a mass movement to improve quality. Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1 adopted the method of "combining mutual visits and mutual inspections," organizing workers in the preceding process to visit the subsequent process, enabling every worker to care about product quality through the visits. In May, the winding workshop paid attention to this problem, and waste cotton drastically decreased from 2,900 pounds to 900 pounds.
    Textile factories in various regions appropriately adjusted machines that were running at excessively high speeds and strengthened equipment inspection and maintenance work, actively helping workers improve their operational skills, which played a significant role in improving product quality. For example, Beijing State-owned Cotton Mill No. 3 implemented a mass equipment inspection, repairing machines with poor operating conditions. At the same time, it mobilized all maintenance workers to carry out a competition movement for standard machine stations, greatly encouraging the initiative of maintenance workers. After a series of efforts, machine equipment improved significantly, which played a major role in improving product quality and reducing material consumption. The Tianjin Textile Industry Bureau adopted the advanced work method of Kovalev, concentrated the operational advantages of more than 30 production experts, and, with reference to the Hao Jianxiu work method, summarized the fine yarn spinning and doffing operation method suitable for current production requirements, with very good results.
    Many factories strengthened raw cotton management and temperature and humidity management to ensure the improvement of product quality. This year, the characteristic of raw cotton is low grade. In response to this situation, various regions devised various methods to spin good yarn from low-grade cotton. They strengthened the inspection of raw cotton bale by bale, reasonably arranged process design according to the performance of raw cotton, adjusted machine parameters, strengthened the impurity removal efficiency of the opening and cleaning process, and improved the quality of semi-finished products. As a result, they successfully spun high-quality yarn from low-grade cotton. (Attached picture)

    多纺好纱多织好布
    本报讯　从二季度开展以提高产品质量为中心的增产节约运动以来，全国棉纺织工业棉纱、棉布的质量普遍提高。如棉布的入库一等品率，陕西由1月份的84.67％，提高到5月份的97.04％，上海由87.51％提高到95.81％。
    为了提高产品的质量，各地纺织部门发动群众对质量问题进行全面检查。河北、陕西、北京、沈阳等地纺织工业部门召开了五级干部会议，针对提高质量、减少浪费、开展增产节约运动进行了广泛深入的鸣放辩论，通过摆事实，算细帐，找根源，想办法，使广大职工对提高质量有了深刻的认识。上海纺织工业局4月份组织各公司和四百九十五个工厂，对二十四种大类产品的质量进行了自查和互查，听取了商业部门、消费者和协作厂的意见，举办了质量展览会，大张旗鼓地揭发质量上存在的缺点，积极依靠群众研究改进，获得了显著效果。上海国棉二厂，运用了上下、左右、内外结合的办法对质量进行了全面检查，并把提高质量的要求向群众交底，群众提出了“人人把守质量关，不许次货逃过关，大家同抓四个关（检验、技术、操作和清洁工作），提高质量过好关”的口号，很快就形成了一个提高质量的群众运动。上海国棉一厂采取“互相访问和互相检查相结合”的办法，组织前一道工序工人到后一道工序访问，通过访问使工人人人关心产品质量。5月份并筒车间注意了这个问题，回丝从二千九百磅骤降到九百磅。
    各地纺织厂对原来机器运转速度过高的机台进行了适当调整，并加强了设备的检修维护工作，积极帮助工人提高操作技术水平，对提高产品质量起了很大作用。如北京国棉三厂，实行群众性设备大检查，对运转情况不良的机器进行了检修。同时发动全体保全保养工人，开展标准机台的竞赛运动，大大鼓舞了保全、保养工的积极性。经过一系列工作，机器设备有显著改进，对产品质量的提高和减少材料的消耗起了很大作用。天津纺织工业局采用郭瓦廖夫
  先进工作方法，集中了三十多名生产能手的操作优点，参照郝建秀工作法，总结成适合现在生产要求的细纱挡车，落纱操作法，效果很好。
    许多厂从加强原棉管理和温湿度管理来保证产品质量的提高。今年原棉的特点是品级低。各地针对
  这个情况，想了各种办法使低级棉纺好纱。加强原棉的逐包检验，根据原棉性能，合理安排工艺设计，调整机器参变数，加强了清花工序的除杂效能，提高半成品质量等办法，结果试用低级棉花纺出了优级纱。（附图片）
