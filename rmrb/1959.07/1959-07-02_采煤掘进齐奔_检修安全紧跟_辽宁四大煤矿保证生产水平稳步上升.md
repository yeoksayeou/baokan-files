Coal Mining and Tunneling Advance Together; Inspection and Safety Closely Follow: Liaoning's Four Major Coal Mines Ensure a Steady Rise in Production Levels

(Our newspaper, Shenyang, July 1st) Liaoning Province's four major state-owned coal mines are seizing the third quarter, actively adopting effective measures, focusing on both coal mining and tunneling (stripping), and vigorously grasping the overhaul of mechanical and electrical equipment and safe production, to ensure the comprehensive overfulfillment of the third quarter plan and greet the tenth anniversary of the National Day.

In the first half of this year, the raw coal output of the four major state-owned coal mines in Fushun, Fuxin, Benxi, and Beipiao exceeded the raw coal output of the same period in 1958 by 53.4%. Currently, the workers of these four major state-owned coal mines are advancing victoriously. As early as mid-June, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a provincial coal mine industry conference to comprehensively arrange the work for the second half of the year, requiring coal mine workers throughout the province to continue to exert their efforts, strive for the upper reaches, and comprehensively overfulfill the state plan with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Each mine has arranged the third quarter work specifically according to the requirements of the provincial party committee, adopting effective measures to promote the steady improvement of coal production levels. The average daily coal production of the Fushun, Fuxin, Benxi, and Beipiao mines in late June increased by about 20% compared with mid-June. After the leaders at all levels of the Fuxin Mining Bureau strengthened their leadership and management of production, they eliminated major production interruption accidents in late June, and the raw coal production level steadily increased accordingly, with an average daily coal production increase of more than 24% compared to mid-June.

While grasping coal production, all mines are also vigorously grasping production preparation work such as tunneling and stripping to ensure the steady improvement of coal production levels. From the mining bureaus and mines to the pit mouths, special personnel are in place to grasp production preparation work, supplement and strengthen the manpower for tunneling and stripping, and equip them with sufficient trucks and tools, so that tunneling and stripping and coal mining can advance together. The Beipiao Mining Bureau also held a tunneling professional meeting to specifically study how to strengthen tunneling work, provide coal mining with sufficient working faces, ensure the completion of the third quarter plan, and prepare for the leap forward in the fourth quarter. After they strengthened tunneling work, the average daily progress of tunneling in late June increased from 384 meters in mid-June to 411 meters.

The overhaul and maintenance of mechanical and electrical equipment and roadways are listed as one of the important measures to ensure the completion of the third quarter plan. In order to promote the overhaul of mechanical and electrical equipment in various mines, the Liaoning Coal Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry convened a professional conference on the overhaul of mechanical and electrical equipment at the end of June, requiring all mines to conduct a major inspection of all equipment, formulate an overhaul schedule, and assign special personnel to be responsible for it. In the third quarter, all equipment that needs to be overhauled will be overhauled, and sufficient spare parts and accessories are required to be prepared to meet temporary needs. At the same time, they are drawing people from various mines to form a safety inspection team to inspect the safety production of various mines, exchange safety production experiences, and promote the safety production of various mines.

    采煤掘进齐奔　检修安全紧跟
    辽宁四大煤矿保证生产水平稳步上升
    本报沈阳1日电　辽宁省四大国营煤矿，抓紧第三季度，积极采取有效措施，采煤和掘进（剥离）双管齐下，大抓机电设备检修和安全生产，保证全面超额的完成第三季度计划，迎接国庆十周年。
    今年上半年，抚顺、阜新、本溪和北票四大国营煤矿的原煤产量，超过1958年同时期原煤产量53.4％。目前这四大国营煤矿职工正在乘胜前进，早在6月中旬，中共辽宁省委就召开了全省的煤矿工业会议，全面的安排了下半年工作，要求全省煤矿职工，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省全面超额的完成国家计划。各矿都根据省委的要求，具体地安排了第三季度工作，采取有效措施，推动煤炭生产水平稳步提高。抚顺、阜新、本溪和北票四矿6月下旬的日产煤量，平均比6月中旬就提高了20％左右。阜新矿务局的各级领导，加强了对生产的领导和管理后，6月下旬消灭了重大的中断生产事故，原煤生产水平随之稳步上升，平均每日产煤量比中旬提高24％以上。
    各矿在抓煤炭生产的同时，都狠狠的抓掘进和剥离等生产准备工作，以保证煤炭生产水平的稳步提高，从各矿务局、矿到坑口，都设有专人抓生产准备工作，补充和加强了掘进和剥离的人力，配备了足够车皮和工具，使掘进和剥离同采煤双管齐下。北票矿务局还召开了掘进专业会议，专门研究了如何加强掘进工作，供给采煤以足够的工作面，保证完成第三季度计划，并为第四季度的跃进做好准备。他们加强掘进工作之后，6月下旬的掘进平均日进度，已经从中旬的三百八十四公尺提高到四百一十一公尺。
    机电设备和巷道的检修和维护，被列为保证完成第三季度计划的重要措施之一。煤炭工业部辽宁煤炭管理局，为了促进各矿机电设备的检修工作，他们在6月末召开了机电设备检修专业会议，要求各矿对所有设备进行一次大检查，制订出检修进度计划，指定专人负责。在第三季度里，把所有需要检修的设备都检修好，并要求准备足够的备品和配件，满足临时需要。同时，他们正在从各矿抽人，组成安全检查团，到各矿检查安全生产情况，一面交流安全生产经验，一面促进各矿的安全生产。
