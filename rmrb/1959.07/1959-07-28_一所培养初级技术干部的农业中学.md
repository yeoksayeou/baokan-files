    An Agricultural Middle School Cultivating Junior Technical Cadres
    By our reporter Wang Yunshan
    I remember back in the autumn of 1957, I happened to see the grand opening of the Daqu Agricultural Middle School in Yuncheng County, Shanxi Province, in the film "Newsreel." The film narration mentioned that this kind of school is a seedling in China's education cause, and it has a strong vitality... Now, two years have passed. How has that seedling grown? And how did it grow? To find out, I recently paid a special visit to it.
    The Nascent Rural Technical Force
    The Daqu Agricultural Middle School is located in a spacious courtyard north of Daqu Village. Two rows of lush poplar trees shield the snow-white walls, and around the walls are fields of green crops. Right next to the school on the south side is the management area's joint processing plant, which is also the labor site for students to engage in various mechanical internships; connected to the factory is the agricultural middle school's agricultural experimental field. As soon as we arrived at the school, we saw a group of male and female students carrying hoes, following a teacher back from the fields.

    This school is not large in scale. Currently, there are only forty-seven students and three full-time teachers. The principal is the secretary of the Party branch of the management area. The equipment is also very simple: in addition to some necessary dormitories, classrooms, desks and chairs, and a small number of recreational supplies, there are hoes, sickles, and other agricultural tools.

    However, this agricultural middle school has already supplied more than 30 young intellectuals to the people's commune to build a new socialist countryside. These young men and women have basically acquired a junior high school education level through the study and production of the agricultural middle school, and have initially mastered the elementary professional knowledge of all aspects of agricultural production, and have become a vital force for the development of production in the people's commune. Technicians in the management area's bee farm, drivers of the tractor station, boiler operators in the processing plant, teachers in kindergartens, announcers on the radio station, operators on the telephone switchboard... most of them are students of the agricultural middle school. Zhao Gendian, Yao Dingxi, Yao Wutao and other eight students were in several production teams, and in the past, because there were no good accountants, the economic procedures were very chaotic, which affected the enthusiasm of the members for production. After they became accountants, they made all kinds of account books in the team clear, and the members praised them as "good housekeepers." Qu Naiqi, who had only lived in elementary school for one year, was sent to Yuncheng Agricultural College for further study for half a year by the commune after studying in the agricultural middle school for two years. After returning to the commune, he served as a veterinarian. In the tense summer production, he carried a medicine bag, braved the wind and rain and the scorching sun, and ran around in the fields and villages every day, carrying out disease prevention and control for livestock, so that the 500 livestock in the Daqu management area did not miss work due to illness in the hot summer.
    A Good Combination of Work and Study
    In terms of production labor, the agricultural middle school is a production unit of the management area. The management area allocates 300 mu of land to the agricultural middle school, stipulates production tasks, and supplies the agricultural middle school with the agricultural tools, livestock, and other investments required for production. The income belongs to the management area, and rewards are given for exceeding the specified output. The students of the agricultural middle school participate in labor every day in the same way as the members, and work points are recorded. After the autumn harvest, they participate in profit sharing according to the number of workdays.

    In terms of study, teachers and students live together, and attend three classes from 6:00 to 9:00 every day, participate in labor from 10:00 to 2:00 in the afternoon, and start studying again after a two-hour lunch break. There are always five hours of study time every day. The implementation of these measures not only promotes the enthusiasm of students for studying and production, but also ensures the normal progress of the school's teaching, production labor, and scientific activities because the school has fixed land, dormitories, and classrooms.

    If the agricultural middle school is to implement half-day labor and half-day study, it must have a fixed production base. After the Daqu Agricultural Middle School was built in the autumn of 1956, it once adopted a system of attending classes every other day and laboring every other day. The students lived in various families, and there was no special organization to manage them. The school was only in charge of study, and the production team was in charge of labor. As a result, they were pulling in all directions and neglecting one thing for another. Production was not good, and study was difficult. Based on this situation, the school committee changed it to: teachers and students live and eat together, and implement half-day study and half-day labor. But there are also problems: because students do not have a fixed labor place, production teams often need labor, and often look for the school. This brings difficulties to the school's teaching arrangements, and the production team also often makes suggestions to the school because it cannot use the students easily. One day, the school was having a test, but the production team wanted the students to rush to deliver manure, and the two sides argued endlessly and felt unhappy. It was not until the spring of 1958 that the current method of contracting work and output was devised after repeated research by the school committee and the production team, thereby establishing a normal teaching and production order for the school, which provided a reliable basis for completing the teaching plan and the production plan.

    On the first day I went to Daqu Agricultural Middle School, I ate the fresh vegetables grown by the teachers and students themselves: stir-fried green beans, fried zucchini, cucumber salad, etc. The director of teaching said: "In a few days, you will also eat our cantaloupe and watermelon! The apples are also as big as fists."

    In fact, the fruits of the labor of teachers and students are more than these. It should be said that the construction and start-up of this agricultural middle school were mostly done by teachers and students themselves. At the beginning of the school's construction, there were no classrooms for classes, so they borrowed the classrooms of the elementary school; later, they found classrooms, but there were no tables and benches, so they used bricks to replace them; they found school buildings that needed to be renovated, so teacher Wang Zhiheng himself worked as a mason, and the students worked as laborers, mudding the walls and building the kang...

    Don't look at the simple equipment of the school and the small expenses, but all of these, in addition to the careful calculation of all teachers and students, are solved from the development of production. In the past year alone, students earned more than 1,000 yuan through spare-time labor such as collecting medicinal herbs. With this money, they not only solved the expenses for books, pens, ink, and notebooks required by students and the expenses for kerosene, textbooks, chalk, etc. required by the school, but also purchased recreational supplies such as basketballs, and added many tables, chairs, and benches. Now they have a surplus of more than 600 yuan. At the same time, last year, each student averaged 160 workdays. In addition to sharing 10 workdays to the teachers, they all achieved self-sufficiency. When the students talked about these situations, they all said happily: the agricultural middle school is run at the doorstep, without running around, without spending money, and production and study are convenient.
  Production and Study Promote Each Other and Reap a Double Harvest
    The Daqu Agricultural Middle School has a three-year system. It is a very arduous task to comprehensively complete the teaching plan within three years, so that students can learn the main courses such as politics, Chinese, mathematics, and agricultural basic knowledge, and at the same time, adhere to participating in production labor to ensure the completion of the production plan. However, because the teaching work of the agricultural middle school is easy to combine with production practice and to carry out production labor, it is also easy to combine with teaching, which becomes a favorable condition for completing the teaching tasks and production tasks. For example, in plant science teaching, in addition to explaining in detail the lessons that are closely related to production as the focus, the teacher also pays attention to combining the local seasons and production needs to arrange teaching, so that a lot of theoretical knowledge is directly applied to production.

    In production labor, when the management area proposed to sow and fertilize in accordance with local conditions, the agricultural middle school teachers led twelve students and spent eight days classifying, grading and scientifically analyzing the soil of the 3,400 mu of land in the management area; in addition to treating cotton aphids, the agricultural middle school took the field as a classroom, taught the students the life cycle of cotton aphids, learned the methods of preparing medicines, and launched the work of eliminating and treating cotton aphids. Through these labors, the students have learned practical knowledge and made technical demonstrations and guidance for the production of the management area.

    The students who are going to graduate from Daqu Agricultural Middle School this year have comprehensively learned the main basic courses and professional courses such as politics, Chinese, arithmetic, history and geography according to the teaching plan. The results of previous exams show that most students are above 80 points. Last autumn, when the agricultural machinery maintenance training class held by the Provincial Department of Agricultural Construction recruited students, it required that they must have a junior high school education level. Qiao Pangjing, who had studied in the agricultural middle school for two years, took the exam there and got the second place. Many students said: when they entered the school, they were worried that both study and production would be delayed, but now it is a double harvest of study and production. (Attached picture)

    一所培养初级技术干部的农业中学
    本报记者　王云山
    记得是1957年的秋天，偶然在电影“新闻简报”里，看到山西运城县大渠农业中学成立的盛况。电影解说词提到，这种学校是我国教育事业上的幼苗，它有着旺盛的生命力……。如今，时间已经过去了两年，那个幼苗成长的怎样？又是如何成长的？为了看个究竟，我最近特地访问了它。
    新生的农村技术队伍
    大渠农业中学设在大渠村北一个宽阔的大院里，两排茂密的杨树遮着那雪白的围墙，围墙四周是一片碧绿的庄稼。紧靠学校南侧，是管理区的联合加工厂，也是学生们从事各种机械实习的劳动场所；与工厂接连着的是农业中学的农业试验场。我们一到学校，就见有一伙扛着锄头的男女学生，跟着一位教师从地里回来了。
    这所学校规模并不大，目前全校只有四十七个学生，三个专职教员。校长是管理区的党总支书记。设备也很简单：除有一些必要的宿舍、教室、课桌和少数文娱活动用品外，就是锄头、镰刀等农具。
    然而，就是这样一所农业中学，却已经给人民公社输送了三十多名建设新农村的青年知识分子了。这些青年男女由于通过农业中学的学习、生产，基本上具备了初中文化水平，初步掌握了农业生产各方面的初级专业知识，变成了人民公社发展生产的一支生力军。管理区养蜂场的技术员、拖拉机站的驾驶员、加工厂的锅驼机手、幼儿园的教师、广播站上的播音员、电话总机上的话务员……多数是农业中学的学生。赵跟点、姚丁喜、姚五桃等八个学生所在的几个生产队，以往因为没有好会计，经济手续很混乱，影响了社员的生产积极性。他们担任会计后，便把队里各种账簿弄得一清二楚，社员称赞是“好当家手”。原来仅在高小住过一年的曲乃琦，在农业中学学习两年后，又被公社保送到运城农业专科学校深造了半年，回社后即担任了兽医。在紧张的夏季生产中，他背着医药包，不畏风雨和炎日，每天奔跑在田间、村庄，给牲口进行疾病防治，使大渠管理区的五百头牲畜在炎热的夏天，没有因病缺勤。
    良好的耕读结合形式
    在生产劳动上，农业中学是管理区的一个生产单位。管理区给农业中学拨出三百亩土地，规定生产任务，供给农业中学在生产中所需的农具、牲畜和其他投资，收入归管理区所有，超过规定产量即进行奖励。农业中学学生们照社员的办法，每天参加劳动，均记工分，秋后按劳动日参加分红。
    在学习上，师生集体食宿，每天六点至九点上三节课，十点至下午两点参加劳动，午饭休息两小时又开始学习。每天总有五个小时的学习时间。实行这些办法，不仅促进了学生学习、生产的积极性，而且由于学校有了固定的土地和宿舍、教室，就保证了学校教学、生产劳动、科学活动的正常进行。
    农业中学要实行半天劳动、半天学习，就要有固定的生产基地。1956年秋天大渠农业中学建校以后，曾经采用隔日上课、隔日劳动的制度。学生散居各家，无专门组织管理，只是学校管学习，生产队管劳动，结果是东拉西扯，顾此失彼，生产搞不好，学习也难进行。校委会根据这种情况，即改为：师生集体食宿，同吃同住，实行半日学习，半日劳动。但也有问题：学生因为没有固定的劳动场所，生产队多会需要劳力，多会就找学校。这样，就给学校的教学安排带来困难，生产队也因为使用学生不能得心应手，经常向学校提意见。有一天，学校正在测验，生产队却要学生突击送粪，双方争执不休，均感不快。直到1958年春天，经过校委会与生产队的多次研究，才想出了现在所实行的包工包产的办法，从而使学校建立起正常的教学和生产秩序，这对完成教学计划和生产计划都有了可靠的基础。
    我头一天去大渠农业中学，就吃到师生们亲手栽培的新鲜蔬菜：什么油炒豆角、油煎西葫芦、蒜拌黄瓜等等，教导主任说：“再过几天你还会吃到我们的甜瓜和西瓜呢！苹果长得也有拳头大了。”
    其实，师生们的劳动成果何止这些呢？应该说这个农业中学的建设和起家，大都是师生们亲手干的。建校开始，要上课没教室，就借小学校的教室；以后找到了教室，却没有桌子和凳子，他们就用砖块来代替；找到校舍需要整修，教师王芷衡就自己作泥匠，学生当小工，泥起了墙壁，垒起了炕。……
    不要看学校的设备简单，开支不太大，但所有这些，除了全体师生精打细算外，都是从发展生产中解决的，仅去年一年，学生们通过采药材等业余劳动，就收入一千多元。他们用这笔钱不但解决了学生所需用的书籍、笔墨、抄本和学校所需用的灯油、教科书、粉笔等费用，还购置了篮球等文娱用品，补增了不少桌椅、板凳。现在他们还有六百余元的积累。同时，去年每个学生平均作了一百六十个劳动日，每人除给教员分摊十个劳动日外，都达到自给自足。学生们谈到这些情况时，都兴高采烈地说：农业中学办在家门口，不跑腿，不花钱，生产，学习都方便。
  生产学习互促进双丰收
    大渠农业中学确定学制为三年。在三年内要全面完成教学计划，使学生都能学好所规定的政治、语文、数学和农业基础知识等主要课程，同时坚持参加生产劳动，确保生产计划的完成，这是一项十分繁重的任务。但是，由于农业中学的教学工作便于结合生产实际，进行生产劳动，又便于结合教学，成为完成教学任务和生产任务的有利条件。比如在植物学教课中，教师除把与生产有密切关系的课文作为重点详加解释外，并注意结合当地时令和生产需要，安排教学，使不少理论知识直接运用于生产。
    在生产劳动中，当管理区提出因地制宜地播种、施肥时，农业中学教师就率领十二个学生，用八天时间，把管理区的三千四百亩地的土壤，全部进行了分等、划类和科学分析；除治棉蚜时，农业中学又以田间为课堂，向学生们讲了棉蚜的生活规律，学习了配置药剂的办法，展开除治棉蚜工作。学生们通过这些劳动，都学到了实际知识，并对管理区的生产，作了技术上的示范与指导。
    大渠农业中学今年将要毕业的学生，已经按照教学计划，全面地学完了政治、语文、算术、史地等主要基础课程和专业课程，历次考试的结果，大部分学生都在八十分以上。去年秋天，省农业建设厅举办的农业机械检修训练班招考学生的时候，要求必须具备初中文化程度，在农业中学学习了两年的乔胖景，在那里考试，却得了第二名。许多学生说：进校时，还担心学习、生产两耽误，现在却是学习、生产双丰收。（附图片）
