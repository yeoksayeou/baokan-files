Xinhua News Agency, Athens, July 27th: According to TASS, Manolis Glezos wrote a letter from "Averoff Prison" on the 24th to all those around the world who are fighting for his freedom and the freedom of other Greek democrats, expressing his gratitude for their support.

    The Greek "Dawn Daily" published the letter on July 26th.

    Glezos pointed out that the recently concluded trial of him and other Greek democrats was a serious violation of human rights. However, he said, Greece should not be associated with those who persecute freedom. In Greece, there has always been an irrepressible love for freedom, "If democracy is brutally persecuted here, it is only because it is deeply rooted among the people, because the brutal rulers recognize their own weakness and are gripped by fear."

    He wrote: "In the recently concluded trial, not only a few people, but the entire people were persecuted. When the servants of foreigners forbade the defendants from speaking, they actually wanted to forbid all those in our country who demand freedom, demand bread, and especially demand peace from speaking."

    He wrote: In Greece, "endless sorrow has turned into anger, resistance, and an indomitable struggle against rocket bases that spread death, against enslaving laws, and to break free from a handful of exploiters. What our accusers want to strike down is precisely this struggle, and this struggle is part of the worldwide march towards a better future. But this struggle gives the outcome of this trial great significance, because in these fifteen days, people, including those who are the most conservative, but upright, have learned the truth, and have once again seen that the truth is on the side of the defendants."

    Glezos then pointed out that the trial against them has ended, but in Greece, "democracy is still in the shackles of the three hundred and seventy-fifth fascist law and all the enslaving laws of the civil war era." There are also dozens of patriots who have been languishing in prison for five years, awaiting trial, victims of the same conspiracy. Thousands of Greek resistance fighters are still imprisoned or in exile.

    He emphasized that not only is this trial itself a challenge to the interests of world democracy, but the entire tyrannical system in Greece is also a challenge to the interests of world democracy.

    Glezos finally called on the world's democrats to "rise up to defend Greece!" He wrote, "In spirit, Greece has made valuable contributions to freedom and civilization, and therefore it is entitled to demand that democracy return to its homeland."

### 格列索斯狱中寄出书简  呼吁继续斗争结束希腊暴政

    格列索斯狱中寄出书简
    呼吁继续斗争结束希腊暴政
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社雅典讯：曼诺里斯·格列索斯24日从“阿维罗夫监狱”中写了一封信给全世界为了他和其他希腊民主人士的自由而斗争的人们，表示感谢他们的支持。
    希腊“黎明日报”在7月26日刊载了这封信。
    格列索斯指出，刚刚结束的对他和其他希腊民主人士的审讯是严重地侵犯人权。但是，他说，不应该把希腊同那些迫害自由的人们联系在一起。在希腊，永远存在着对自由的不可抑制的热爱，“如果民主在这里受到残酷的迫害，这只是因为它在人民中间深深地扎了根，因为残暴的统治者认识到自己的软弱无能和陷入恐惧”。
    他写道：“在刚刚结束的审讯中，不仅是一些人，而且是全体人民受到了迫害。外国人的仆从们在禁止被告发言的时候实际上是想禁止我国所有那些要求自由、要求面包、特别是要求和平的人发言。”
    他写道：在希腊，“无穷的忧伤变成了愤怒、反抗和不屈不挠的斗争，这种斗争是为了反对散布死亡的火箭基地，反对奴役性的法律，争取摆脱一小撮剥削者。控诉我们的人所要打击的也正是这种斗争，而这种斗争是全世界向着更美好的未来前进的一部分。但是，这个斗争使这次审讯的结果具有很重要的意义，因为在这十五天内，人们，包括那些最保守的，但是正直的人们在内，都知道了事实的真相，而且再一次地看到了，真理是在被告这一边。”
    格列索斯然后指出，对他们的审讯已经结束，但是，在希腊，“民主正处于法西斯的第三百七十五条法律和内战时期的一切奴役性的法律的桎梏之中”。还有几十个爱国者已经在牢狱中消磨了五年岁月，等待着审讯，他们是同样阴谋的受害者。数以千计的希腊抵抗运动战士们还被囚禁在监狱里，或者在流放中。
    他强调指出，不仅这次审讯本身是对世界民主利益的一种挑战，而且希腊的整个暴政制度也是对世界民主利益的一种挑战。
    格列索斯最后要求全世界的民主主义者“起来保卫希腊！”他写道，“从精神上来说，希腊曾经为自由和文明作出宝贵的贡献，因此，它有资格要求民主回到它的国土上。”
