Pruning the Main Stem of Cotton: Timeliness is Key
Xia Yu

The issue of pruning the main stem of cotton has been debated in recent years. Before 1958, the debate revolved around early versus late pruning. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, some even advocated for not pruning at all and conducted experiments. The questions before us now are: first, should the main stem of cotton be pruned? Second, if so, when?

Whether or not to prune the main stem of cotton should be considered from the characteristics of cotton itself. Cotton is an indeterminate inflorescence crop, capable of continuously flowering and fruiting. Cotton flowering has its own specific pattern, starting from the first node of the first fruiting branch at the bottom, then progressing branch by branch and node by node from bottom to top and from inside to outside in a spiral pattern, continuing until the winter temperature drops and the plant is frozen to death. The entire flowering process lasts for more than three months. If the main stem is not pruned, allowing the terminal bud of the main stem to stretch upwards vigorously, it is possible to increase the number of flower buds. However, the flower buds on the uppermost fruiting branches develop very slowly in the later stages and often die before flowering and boll formation, making them ineffective flower buds. Timely pruning of the main stem, saving nutrients for early, effective cotton bolls, can make the bolls larger and heavier, with earlier boll opening and better quality, achieving increased production.

Furthermore, nutrients in the soil, after being absorbed by the cotton plant's roots, must be transported to the branches, leaves, and other parts. According to the theory of Soviet academician Lysenko, nutrients are rapidly transported to the part that grows fastest and most vigorously. The fastest growing part of the cotton plant is the growing point at the tip of the main stem, so most of the nutrients are concentrated on supplying the consumption of the growing point. If the main stem is not pruned, the various parts of the fruiting branches and the flower buds and young bolls will be in a state of "hunger" due to insufficient nutrient supply, and will have to fall off the fruiting branches. Allowing early flower buds to fall off will greatly affect yield.

Another aspect is that allowing the cotton plant to grow upwards vigorously, or allowing the branches to grow too long, will cause the cotton plants to crowd each other, hindering ventilation and light penetration, and easily breeding diseases and pests, increasing bud and boll drop. Only timely pruning of the main stem can ensure ventilation and light penetration in the cotton field, advance boll cracking and fluffing, and reduce hard locks and boll rot.

The above three points illustrate that pruning the main stem is a particularly important part of cotton pruning techniques and is the main factor determining cotton yield and fiber quality. Pruning the main stem is essential, and this should be affirmed. Of course, when considering pruning the main stem, it must be combined with measures such as removing vegetative branches, removing strong buds, and removing lateral shoots to further maximize the advantages of pruning the main stem of cotton.

When should the main stem of cotton be pruned? Should it be pruned early or late? In 1958, in order to fully utilize the cotton growing season and strive for more autumn bolls, appropriately late pruning was adopted. Facts have proven that this was the right thing to do. But this does not mean that the later the pruning, the better. Pruning too late has almost the same disadvantages as not pruning. Because pruning too late will cause a large amount of nutrients to be consumed in the elongation of the cotton plant's growing point, the number of ineffective branches and ineffective flower buds on the upper part of the cotton plant will increase, while the growth of the middle and lower cotton bolls will be greatly affected, increasing bud and boll drop, resulting in late maturity and reduced yield. However, the disadvantages of pruning too early are even more obvious. Early pruning can achieve the goal of early maturity and increase a few pre-frost flowers, but early pruning will limit the growth of the cotton plant, lose a batch of useful fruiting branches and cotton bolls, and greatly reduce the total yield. It is worth noting that cotton plants whose main stems are pruned too early will promote the proliferation of strong buds due to vigorous growth, wasting plant nutrients and greatly affecting light conditions. In short, the main stem must be pruned, and timeliness is key. Too early or too late is not good.

How can timely pruning be achieved? At least three principles must be grasped: First, determine based on the local time of autumn frost and the growth and development of cotton plants. For example, in southern Shanxi, it generally takes 70 to 80 days for cotton to go from budding to fluffing, and the average date of the first frost in the area is October 25th. If there are 70 days before the frost, post-frost bolls can mature. Therefore, the appropriate time for pruning should be between August 15th and 20th, that is, in early to mid-August. Various regions can determine the appropriate time for pruning the main stem according to local conditions. Second, under conditions of more rain and insufficient sunlight, cotton fields in fertile land tend to grow excessively and should be pruned appropriately early. If there is less rain and the climate is dry, the cotton plants grow compactly, and ventilation and light penetration are good, then pruning should be appropriately delayed. Third, it is necessary to look at soil fertility and distinguish between irrigated and dry land. In irrigated land with sufficient fertility, pruning can be delayed to strive for more autumn bolls; in dry land with poor fertility, pruning should be appropriately early to protect the middle bolls.

    正顶该打　贵在适时
    夏雨
    对棉花打正顶的问题，近几年来是有争论的。1958年以前，存在着早打与晚打之争。在1958年大跃进中，又有人主张干脆不打顶，还进行了试验。目前摆在我们面前的争论问题是：第一，棉花正顶究竟打不打？第二，如果要打，啥时候打？
    棉花正顶该不该打，这要从棉花的特性去考虑。棉花是一种无限花序作物，能够连续不断地开花结果。棉花开花有它自己特有的规律，即从下部第一果枝的第一节开始开花，然后逐枝逐节地由下而上、由内而外，呈螺旋状的开下去，直到冬季温度降低、植株被冻死止，整个开花过程，要延续三个月以上。如果不打正顶，任凭棉株主干的顶芽一股劲向上伸展，是可以增加许多花蕾的。不过，最上部的果枝在后期着生的花蕾发育很慢，往往在没有开花结铃之前就冻死，是些无效花蕾。而适时打去正顶，节省下许多养分供给早期有效棉铃，就能使棉铃大而重，吐絮早，品质好，达到增产的目的。
    再说，土壤中的养料，经过棉株根系吸收后，要输送到枝叶等其他部分去。根据苏联李森科院士的理论，那部分生长最快、最旺盛，养料即迅速向那儿输送。而棉株生长最快的是主干顶端的生长点，于是养料大部分都集中在供给生长点的消耗。如果不打正顶，果枝上各部分和花蕾幼铃，就会由于养料供应不足而呈现“饥饿”状态，以致不得不从果枝上脱落下来。让早期花蕾脱落下来，就会大大影响产量。
    还有一层，任凭棉株一股劲往上长，或者分枝长得过长，棉株拥挤，妨碍通风透光，容易滋生病虫，增加蕾铃脱落。只有适时打去正顶，才能保证棉田通风透光，提早裂桃吐絮，减少僵瓣和烂铃。
    以上三点可以说明，打正顶是棉花整枝技术中特别重要的环节，是决定棉花产量和纤维品质的最主要的因素。正顶不可不打，这是应肯定的。当然，在考察打正顶时，还必须和打油条、打强芽、打旁顶等措施结合起来，才能更加发挥棉花打正顶的优越性。
    棉花正顶应该啥时候打？是早打还是晚打呢？在1958年，为了充分利用棉花生长期，争取多结秋桃，采取了适当晚打顶的做法。事实证明，这样作是对的。但这绝不意味着打顶愈晚愈好。打顶过晚，和不打顶的害处是差不多的。因为打得太晚，就会使大量养分消耗在棉株生长点的伸长上，棉株上部的无效果枝和无效花蕾的数目增多，而中、下部棉铃的成长就要受到很大影响，增加蕾铃脱落，使棉花晚熟减产。但是，过早打顶的坏处则更为明显。早打顶可以达到早熟目的，增加一点霜前花，但早打顶会限制棉株生长，损失一批有用的果枝和棉桃，使总产量大大降低。值得注意的是，过早打去正顶的棉株，由于生长还十分旺盛，结果会促使强芽丛生，虚耗植株养分，大大影响光照条件。总之，正顶要打，贵在适时，过早、过迟都不好。
    怎样才能做到适时打顶呢？最少要掌握三个原则：第一、根据当地秋霜来临的时期和棉株生长发育的状况来确定。比如山西南部棉花从现蕾到吐絮，一般需要七十到八十天的时间，而当地历年来枯霜期平均为10月25日，在霜前有七十天工夫即能成长霜后桃。因此，打顶适期应为8月15日到20日之间，即应在8月上中旬。各地可以因时因地制宜，决定打正顶的合适时期。第二、在多雨、日照不足的条件下，肥地棉田发生徒长现象，应该适当早打。如果雨水较少，气候干旱，棉株生长紧凑，通风透光良好，那就应该适当晚打。第三、要看土壤肥力，要区别水地和旱地。水地、肥力充足的棉田，可以晚点打，争取多结几个秋桃；旱地、肥力差的，要适当早打，以保中部棉铃。
