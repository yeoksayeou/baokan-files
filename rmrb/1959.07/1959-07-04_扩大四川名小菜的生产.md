Expand the Production of Sichuan Famous Snacks
Li Xue, Deputy Director of Sichuan Provincial Department of Commerce

The people of Sichuan have created many famous and well-regarded pickles, preserved vegetables, and dried vegetables. These famous snacks are characterized by their delicious taste and low prices, and are popular condiments among the vast urban and rural population.

In recent years, our province has attached great importance to the production and development of famous snacks. For example, the production of Fuling pickled mustard tuber (zhacai). In the early days of liberation in Sichuan, the annual output was only over 30,000 dan. After liberation, the government established a Pickled Mustard Tuber Production Guidance Committee, rationally adjusted the purchase price of raw materials, and built and expanded fifty pickled mustard tuber processing workshops. By the end of 1956, the output reached about 400,000 dan, an increase of more than twelve times compared with the eve of liberation. The output of other products such as preserved Tianjin cabbage (dongcai) and Yibin sprouts (yacai) has also increased five to nine times compared with the early days of liberation.

However, with the increasing demand in domestic and foreign markets, there is still a large gap between supply and demand. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, assisting relevant departments in doing a good job in the production of pickles, preserved vegetables, and dried vegetables remains an important task for the commercial sector.

At present, some areas still have great potential for the production of famous snacks. As long as the arrangements for labor, arable land, and fertilizer are well made, and the supply of raw materials and ingredients is ensured, the output can be increased in a short period of time. Now, many areas have adopted various forms such as state-owned factories, state-commune joint ventures, and organized commune processing, to fully utilize civilian power to develop the production of famous snacks. However, in order to increase the production of Sichuan famous snacks more quickly, we believe that the following measures must be taken:

First, the production of famous snacks should be closely integrated with local agricultural and sideline production. Most of the famous snacks come from rural areas and have a certain seasonality in production. Products such as daylily, wood ear fungus, pickled mustard tuber, and preserved Tianjin cabbage are all highly time-sensitive products. If they are not grasped tightly, they will be missed. Therefore, commercial departments in various places should, under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, take the initiative to assist the people's communes in arranging labor and technology, and adopt methods that combine agriculture and sideline industries, combine concentrated production with normal production, and combine collective production with decentralized production, to organize production. In the main producing areas of some famous dishes, corresponding leading bodies should also be established to complete the entire process of production, purchase, transportation, and sales in one go.

Second, restore and expand the old production areas of famous snacks and open up new production areas. Due to the rapid improvement of people's consumption levels, the famous snacks that were previously limited to production in certain areas can no longer meet social needs. We must open up new production bases. In fact, many famous snacks can be transplanted. For example, Sichuan daylily was only produced in Qu County in the past. Now, after artificial cultivation, ten special zones and two cities have begun production; the famous Fuling pickled mustard tuber is now also produced in batches in Neijiang, Luzhou, Leshan, Nanchong and other special zones, and the flavor remains unchanged.

Third, strengthen regional cooperation and do a good job in the supply of raw materials. Most famous snacks require special ingredients. For example, pickled mustard tuber requires more than ten ingredients, including star anise, tsaoko cardamom, Sichuan pepper, chili pepper, pepper, and sand ginger, which mainly rely on supplies from other places. In addition to allocating within the province, Sichuan Provincial Commercial Department should also assist in purchasing and supplying from outside the province to maintain the quality of famous snacks.

Fourth, improve technology and increase production. The production of famous snacks has a long history. Now, each brewing factory has some experienced master craftsmen who personally operate or provide technical guidance, retaining traditional operating methods. At the same time, we also pay attention to improving equipment and learning advanced experience from other places to make production and management more in line with scientific principles. At present, some brewing factories throughout the province have established new-style drying rooms and adopted advanced technologies such as salt-free fermentation to reduce costs and shorten the production process. Relevant departments in the province have also specially convened technical exchange meetings on famous snacks to continuously improve product output and quality.

Fifth, strengthen production leadership and establish a professional production team. To expand the production of famous snacks, in addition to mainly relying on the masses to carry out seasonal concentrated processing and production, some fixed factories and workshops must be appropriately established. With fixed professional workers, not only can the quality be guaranteed, but also they can serve as a base for promoting technology and training new workers.

### 扩大四川名小菜的生产

    扩大四川名小菜的生产
    四川省商业厅副厅长　黎雪
    四川人民制造了许多享有盛名的酱腌菜和干菜。这些名小菜都具有味道鲜美、价格低廉的特点，是广大城乡人民喜爱的佐食品。
    几年来，我省十分重视名小菜的生产和发展。如涪陵榨菜，在四川刚解放时，年产量只有三万多担。解放后，政府成立榨菜生产辅导委员会，合理调整原料收购价格，新建和扩建了五十个榨菜加工作坊，到1956年底产量就达到四十万担左右，比解放前夕增加了十二倍以上。其它像冬菜、芽菜的产量，也比刚解放时上升五倍到九倍。
    但是，随着国内外市场需要量的增加，供求之间还有很大的距离。在党委领导下，协助有关部门作好酱腌菜、干菜的生产，仍是商业部门的一项重要任务。
    目前有一些地区，名小菜的生产仍具有很大的潜力，只要作好劳力、耕地、肥料的安排，以及原料、配料的供应，不用很长时间产量就可以增加。现在，许多地区已经采取国营工厂、国家和公社合办、组织公社加工等多种形式，充分利用民间力量，发展名小菜的生产。但是，为了更快地增加四川名小菜的生产，我们认为必须采取这样几个办法：
    第一，把名小菜的生产和当地农副业紧密结合起来。各种名小菜绝大部分是来自农村，并具有一定的生产季节性。如黄花、木耳、榨菜、冬菜等，都是时间性很强的产品，如不抓紧，稍纵即过。因此，各地商业部门应该在党委统一领导下，主动协助人民公社安排劳力、技术，采取农业与副业结合、突击生产与正常生产结合、集体生产与分散生产结合的办法，组织生产。在一些名菜的主要产地，还应建立相应的领导机构，把产、购、运、销，一气呵成。
    第二，恢复和扩大名小菜老产区，开辟新产区。由于人民消费水平的迅速提高，过去只限于某一地区生产的名小菜，已不能满足社会需要。我们必须开辟新的生产基地。事实上，许多名小菜是可以移植的。如四川黄花过去只有渠县一地生产，现在经过人工培植，已有十个专区、两个市开始生产；著名的涪陵榨菜，现在内江、泸州、乐山、南充等专区也成批生产，并且风味依然不变。
    第三，加强地区协作，作好原料供应。大部分名小菜需要特殊的配料。如榨菜配料就有十多种，包括八角、草果、花椒、辣椒、胡椒、沙头等，主要是靠外地供应。四川省商业部门除了在省内调拨以外，还应协助从省外采购供应，以保持名小菜的质量。
    第四，改进技术，提高生产。名小菜的生产都具有悠久的历史，现在各酿造厂都有一些具有丰富生产经验的老师傅，亲自操作或作技术指导，保留着传统的操作方法。同时，我们也注意改进设备，学习外地先进经验，使生产、管理更加合乎科学原则。现在，全省部分酿造厂已建立了新式烘房，采用无盐发酵等先进技术以降低成本，缩短生产过程。省内有关部门，还专门召开了名小菜技术交流会，不断提高产品产量和质量。
    第五，加强生产领导，建立生产专业队伍。扩大名小菜生产，除主要依靠群众，进行季节性突击加工生产外，必须适当地建立一些固定的厂、坊。有了固定的专业工人，既可以保证提高质量，又可以作为推广技术、培训新工人的基点。
