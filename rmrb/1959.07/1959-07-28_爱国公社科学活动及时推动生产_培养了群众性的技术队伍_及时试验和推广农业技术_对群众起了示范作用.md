    This newspaper reports that the Aiguo (Patriotic) People's Commune in Shou County, Anhui Province, relying on the masses and closely integrating with production, promptly carried out scientific research activities, solved existing problems in production, and vigorously promoted production.
    The Aiguo People's Commune established a scientific research institute last year according to the needs of production. In addition to technicians, the institute also absorbed more than one hundred production experts and experienced commune members to jointly conduct various agricultural scientific research activities. Each production brigade of this commune has a technology promotion station, and each production team also has a technology promotion group.
    The scientific research activities of the Aiguo People's Commune are carried out around the current central tasks and closely integrated with production. For example, in the spring, they studied and taught cotton sowing, rice seedling management, close planting, wheat field management, and sweet potato hotbed techniques; in the summer, they studied and taught sweet potato cultivation, corn and bean sowing, and rice management techniques; in the autumn, they studied and taught seed selection and late autumn crop management, and wheat sowing techniques; in the winter, they studied and taught wheat field management techniques. Non-seasonal activities, such as manufacturing indigenous fertilizer and preventing and controlling pests and diseases, were arranged appropriately. In this way, many problems in production were solved promptly and effectively. For example, in the work of preventing and controlling wheat rust, the masses thought that prevention and control was very difficult, and even if treatment was carried out, it was only done after the wheat rust was discovered, which was often very passive, resulting in reduced wheat production. This year, the commune's scientific research institute used scientific instruments to predict the activity of airborne wheat rust spores and underground temperature before the Qingming Festival, and after predicting the occurrence of wheat rust, it actively took preventive measures, worked with experienced farmers to research and manufacture indigenous pesticides, and carried out prevention and control in a timely manner, so that the commune's wheat did not suffer from wheat rust and achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest. The scientific research institute conducted research on rice varieties, close planting, and irrigation. After research and experimentation, it was decided this year to promote excellent varieties such as "Wuju Chuan" (early rice) and "Guihua Qiu" (mid-season rice), and to promote close planting of three by six inches or four by six inches. The institute is affectionately called "Crop Leader" by the commune members.
    The scientific research activities of the Aiguo Commune are carried out in close combination with the masses. The staff of the scientific research institute regularly hold discussions with veteran farmer consultants and production experts, and frequently use visits to solicit their opinions on research topics, understand problems in production, and summarize their production experiences. Especially when encountering difficult problems in research, they listen more widely to the opinions of veteran farmers and production experts, and absorb their rich production experience to solve difficulties. In the Aiguo Brigade of the commune, 20,000 mu of the 60,000 mu of land had very poor soil quality. In order to improve the soil, the staff of the scientific research institute worked with veteran farmers and production experts to conduct research. An old farmer, based on his own experience, introduced the method of adding sandy soil to change the stickiness, and the results were very good. After preliminary improvement, the land was planted with corn and other crops, and some yields increased by two times. For example, when rice stem borers were discovered last year, according to the institute's opinion, 666 powder should be sprayed. More than 300,000 jin of 666 powder were needed for more than 20,000 mu of paddy fields. It was impossible to buy so much pesticide at once. The commune adopted the experience of using toxic wild plants to kill insects introduced by veteran farmers, and mobilized the masses to manufacture a large amount of indigenous pesticides. As a result, pests were eliminated on more than 20,000 mu of rice fields.
    The scientific research institute of the Aiguo Commune pays special attention to the connection with the technical research groups of each production team. They have adopted the methods of regular teaching and roving guidance to strengthen the connection with the technical research groups, and the technical research groups also promptly reflect the difficult problems encountered in production to the scientific research institute. The scientific research institute, through the mutual connection of the veteran farmer consultant committee, agricultural middle school, and mass technical research groups, has formed a process of research—experimentation—summarization—publicity—promotion, so that various agricultural technologies can be rapidly promoted throughout the commune.
    In order to combine scientific research activities with the rich experience of farmers, the scientific research institute has also adopted the method of "combining indigenous and foreign methods." The technical cadres and local experts within the institute form research groups, and experienced veteran farmers from outside the institute are hired as consultants to continuously solicit their opinions on technical research activities and production work, teaching each other, learning from each other's strengths, and overcoming weaknesses. For example, after early rice seedlings were transplanted last year, yellow dwarf disease occurred universally. The scientific researchers believed that it was due to a lack of fertilizer, and immediately applied quick-acting fertilizer. However, three days later, the rice seedlings did not improve. They discussed it with the veteran farmers, who believed that this was not entirely due to a lack of fertilizer, but mainly because the early rice fields were mostly winter-irrigated fields, which had not been exposed to the sun and baked, and the soil was very cold. The surface oil mud did not solidify, and the seedlings were not easy to take root. The veteran farmers introduced the experience of spreading gypsum powder to solidify the surface oil mud. The technicians, based on the principle that increasing the soil temperature can promote crop growth and development, proposed the method of "releasing water and lightly baking" to increase the soil temperature and promote crop growth and development. The veteran farmers also agreed that this opinion made sense. After the commune adopted these comprehensive measures, all the rice seedlings turned green in four or five days and eliminated the disease.
    Over the past year, the scientific research institute of the Aiguo People's Commune has achieved remarkable results through scientific research practice and production practice: First, with the scientific research institute as the core, a mass technical force has been cultivated for the commune through different forms such as batch training, point-to-point teaching, field teaching, conference publicity, and demonstration, training more than 1,700 various technical experts successively, establishing 195 various professional technical research groups. Many commune members have respectively learned techniques such as cotton cultivation management, corn artificial pollination, sweet potato hotbed seedling cultivation, pest and disease prevention and control, as well as indigenous pesticide preparation and medicine and machinery usage. Second, new agricultural technologies have been tested and promoted in a timely manner. They have tested and promoted more than 20 projects, including early crop topdressing, corn artificial pollination, soil improvement, rice cultivation, indigenous pesticide manufacturing, and pest and disease prevention and control. They also frequently reflect the situation to the commune and propose suggestions on agricultural technical measures, which promote the improvement of production technology throughout the commune. More than 20,000 mu of cultivated land with very poor soil has all been improved to varying degrees. Third, the 43 mu of land in the scientific research institute's experimental field achieved high yields last year. The grain yield per unit area was 2.83 times higher than the average yield per unit area of the entire commune. These living facts played a demonstration role for the broad masses.

    爱国公社科学活动及时推动生产
    培养了群众性的技术队伍　及时试验和推广农业技术　对群众起了示范作用
    本报讯　安徽省寿县爱国人民公社依靠群众，紧密结合生产，及时进行科学研究活动，解决了生产上存在的问题，有力地推动了生产。
    爱国人民公社根据生产的需要，在去年成立了科学研究所。所内除技术员以外，还吸收生产能手和生产经验丰富的社员一百多人，共同进行各种农业科学研究活动。这个公社的各个生产大队设有技术推广站，生产队也设有技术推广组。
    爱国人民公社的科学研究活动是围绕当前中心工作、紧密结合生产进行的。如在春季就研究和传授棉花播种、水稻育秧管理和密植、麦田田间管理、山芋温床的技术；夏季就研究和传授山芋栽培、玉米和豆类的播种、水稻管理的技术；秋季就研究和传授选种和晚秋作物管理、麦类播种的技术；冬季就研究和传授麦田管理等技术。对没有季节性的，如制造土化肥、防治病虫害等，适当安排研究。这样，就及时有效地解决了生产上的不少问题。例如，对麦锈病的防治工作，群众认为防治很困难，即使治疗也是等待发现了麦锈病以后才进行，往往很被动，使小麦减产。今年公社的科学研究所在清明节以前就用科学仪器预测空中麦锈病孢子活动情况和地下温度，预测出有麦锈病以后，就积极采取预防的措施，和老农一道研究制造土农药，及时进行防治，使全社的麦子没有发生麦锈病，获得了全面大丰收。科学研究所对水稻品种、密植和灌溉等问题进行了研究，经过研究和试验，今年决定推广“乌咀川”（早稻）、“桂花球”（中稻）等优良品种，决定推广三乘六寸或四乘六寸的密植。研究所被社员们亲切地称为“庄稼头”。
    爱国公社的科学研究活动是采取和群众密切结合进行的。科学研究所的工作人员经常定期与老农顾问、生产能手等座谈，并经常用访问的形式征求他们对研究题目的意见，了解生产中的问题，总结他们生产中的经验。尤其在研究中遇到疑难问题的时候，他们就更广泛地倾听老农、生产能手们的意见，吸收他们丰富的生产经验来解决困难。公社的爱国大队六万亩土地中，有二万亩地的土质很坏，为了改良土壤，科学研究所的工作人员就同老农、生产能手一起研究。有个老农根据自己的经验，介绍用加砂土来改变粘性的方法，结果效果很好。经过初步改良的土地种上玉米等，有的产量增加了两倍。又如去年水稻发现螟虫的时候，根据研究所的意见，要用六六六粉喷撒，二万多亩稻田需要三十多万斤六六六粉，一时买不到这样多药粉，公社采纳老农介绍的毒性野生植物灭虫的经验，并发动群众制造了大量的土农药，结果捕灭二万多亩水稻的害虫。
    爱国公社科学研究所特别注意同各生产队的技术研究小组的联系。他们采取了定期传授巡回辅导的方法，加强同技术研究小组的联系，而技术研究小组也及时向科学研究所反映生产中所遇到的疑难问题。科学研究所通过老农顾问委员会、农业中学、群众性的技术研究小组的互相联系，形成了研究——试验——总结——宣传——推广这样一个过程，使各种农业技术能迅速在全社推广。
    为了使科学研究活动与农民的丰富经验相结合，科学研究所还采取了“土洋结合”的办法，所内的技术干部和土专家组成研究组，并聘请所外有经验的老农当顾问，不断征求他们在技术研究活动和生产工作上的意见，互教互学，取长补短。如去年早稻栽秧以后，普遍发生黄萎病，科学研究人员认为是缺少肥料，当即追施速效肥，但是三天以后稻秧并没有转机。他们就同老农研究，老农们认为这不完全是因为缺肥，主要是因为早稻田多是冬灌田，没有经过晒烤，土壤寒性大，表层油泥没有凝结，秧苗不容易生根。老农们介绍了撒石膏粉使表层油泥凝结的经验。技术人员又根据增加土壤温度能促进作物生长发育的原理，提出“放水轻烤”的办法来增加地温，促使作物生长发育，老农们也都认为这个意见有道理。公社采取了这些综合的措施以后，四、五天稻秧就全部返青，消灭了病害。
    爱国人民公社科学研究所一年来，经过科学研究实践和生产实践，已经取得了显著的成绩：第一，以科学研究所为核心，通过分批集训、分点传授、田头教学、会议宣传、观摩示范等不同形式，为公社培养了一支群众性的技术队伍，先后训练各种技术能手一千七百多人，建立了各种专业技术研究组一百九十五个，全社很多社员已经分别学会了棉花栽培管理、玉米人工授粉、山芋温床育苗、病虫害防治以及土农药配制、药械使用等技术。第二，及时试验和推广新的农业技术。他们试验和推广的项目，有早期作物追肥、玉米人工授粉、改良土壤、培养水稻、制造土农药、防治病虫害等二十多种。他们还经常向公社反映情况；提出有关农业技术措施的建议，促进了全社生产技术的提高。二万多亩土壤很坏的耕地已经全部进行了不同程度的改良。第三，科学研究所试验场的四十三亩土地去年获得高额丰产，粮食单位面积产量比全社平均单产高二点八三倍，这些活生生的事实，对广大群众起了示范作用。　　（高文斌　董瑛）
