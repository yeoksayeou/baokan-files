Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 18th: General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, told a reporter from the Vietnamese "Thong Nhat" (Unity) newspaper that the Vietnamese people's struggle to continue completing the national democratic revolution throughout the country and to unify the fatherland on the basis of independence and democracy will surely be victorious. He pointed out: "Vietnam must be unified. No matter what the current obstacles are, the Geneva Accords must be implemented."

General Vo Nguyen Giap made these remarks when answering a question from a "Thong Nhat" reporter about the possibility of achieving the reunification of the fatherland in accordance with the Geneva Accords, given that the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem clique is stubbornly refusing to negotiate general elections, on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Accords and "Vietnam Day."

General Vo Nguyen Giap emphatically pointed out that the Geneva Accords have not lost their effectiveness. The Geneva Accords still retain their significant value. He said: "The Geneva Accords recognize Vietnam's sovereignty, independence, unity, and territorial integrity. They demonstrate the justice of our people's struggle for peace, unity, independence, and democracy. This is of great significance to our people's national liberation cause."

Regarding the significance of the Asian and African peoples holding "Vietnam Day," General Vo Nguyen Giap said: "The significance of 'Vietnam Day' is enormous. It will inspire the Vietnamese people in both the North and the South to continue their struggle against U.S. imperialism and its accomplices in order to unify the country and demand the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords."

Regarding the issue of demanding that the Laotian government fulfill the Geneva Accords, Vo Nguyen Giap pointed out that the situation in Laos has become very serious. He said that this situation seriously threatens peace in Indochina and the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

Vo Nguyen Giap said that the Vietnamese government cannot but be concerned about the development of the situation in Laos, and has lodged a protest, demanding that the Phoui Sananikone government must abandon its policy of undermining the Geneva Accords and cease their provocative acts.

    武元甲大将说
    越南一定要统一
    新华社河内18日电　越南人民军总司令武元甲大将对越南“统一报”记者说，越南人民为继续在全国范围内完成民族民主革命、为在独立和民主的基础上统一祖国的斗争一定会胜利。他指出：“越南一定要统一。不管当前的障碍怎样，日内瓦协议一定要履行。”
    武元甲大将是在日内瓦协议签订五周年和“越南日”前夕，答“统一报”记者提出的在美吴集团一味拒绝协商普选的情况下，按照日内瓦协议实现统一祖国的可能性如何的问题时说这番话的。
    武元甲大将着重指出，日内瓦协议仍然没有失掉它的作用。日内瓦协议仍然保存着它的重大价值。他说：“日内瓦协议承认越南的主权、独立、统一和领土完整。它说明了我国人民为和平、统一、独立和民主的斗争的正义性。这一点对我国人民的民族解放事业有着重大作用。”
    谈到亚非人民举行“越南日”的意义的问题时武元甲大将说：“越南日”的意义非常巨大。它将鼓舞越南南北人民继续进行反对美帝国主义及其帮凶的斗争，以便统一国家，要求彻底实现日内瓦协议。”
    关于要求老挝政府履行日内瓦协议的问题，武元甲指出，目前，老挝局势变得非常严重。他说，这个局势严重威胁着印度支那的和平和越南民主共和国的安全。
    武元甲说，越南政府不能不对老挝局势的发展感到忧虑，并且提出抗议，要求培·萨纳尼空政府必须放弃破坏日内瓦协议的政策，停止它们的挑衅行为。
