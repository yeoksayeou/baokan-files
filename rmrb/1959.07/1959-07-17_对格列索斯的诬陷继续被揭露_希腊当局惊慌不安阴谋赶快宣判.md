Xinhua News Agency, Athens, July 15th: According to TASS, Athens, the military court trying the Gliasos case concluded the stage of hearing testimony from defense witnesses and a minor plaintiff witness during the evening of the 14th and the morning of the 15th. This plaintiff witness had previously submitted written testimony and was only summoned to court at the request of the defense.

The "marathon" trial on the 14th (as it's being called in court) lasted from 8:30 AM until 1:00 AM, with only a brief break in between. In light of the rising global movement to defend Gliasos, the judges are alarmed and eager to end the trial quickly in order to present world opinion with the fait accompli of Gliasos and the other defendants being sentenced. What particularly unsettles them is that each day of the trial increasingly reveals that the trial of Gliasos and other democrats is entirely a police fabrication.

On the 14th, Gliasos's wife, Anastasia, and his mother, Dimitroka, used new materials to refute the police's lie that Gliasos had met with Kollyanis. Anastasia said that the police insisted that Gliasos had met with Kollyanis on the evening of August 16th, but Gliasos was actually at the cinema with her at the time. She stated the name of the cinema, its location, and the name of the film. Gliasos's mother said that Gliasos was in Rafina from morning till night on August 17th.

Disregarding the new revelations exposing the accusations against Gliasos, the court president attempted to cast doubt on the value of the testimony, arguing that the evidence was provided by Gliasos's relatives.

Also providing testimony on the 14th were Gliasos's comrades in the United Democratic Left Party, members of the party's administrative committee Kizikis, Avgronoulos, and Papadimitriou, as well as journalists and members of parliament from the United Democratic Left Party. They spoke of Gliasos's noble moral character, his boundless loyalty to the Greek people, and the trust placed in him by the United Democratic Left Party, which is beloved by the Greek people.

Starting on the 15th, the court president, judges, and prosecutors began interrogating the defendants. Although the court lacks "evidence" sufficient to prove the defendants' "espionage" crimes, they attempted to use the assertion that the Greek Communist Party is an "espionage organization" as the basis for their accusations. According to this "legal basis" of the military court, as long as it affirms that this or that defendant is a Communist, it can accuse him of engaging in "espionage activities" at will; and any contact with the defendant becomes "evidence of participation in espionage activities."

At the same time, the Greek authorities are intensifying their suppression of the Greek public who are fighting to defend Gliasos and other democrats. Stamatiadis, a member of the administrative committee of the United Democratic Left Party, was arrested on the 14th and is in danger of being exiled.

Pasalidis, the chairman of the United Democratic Left Party, has sent telegrams to the Prime Minister, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of Justice, and the leaders of various political parties, protesting the arrest of the leaders of the United Democratic Left Party and demanding the release of Stamatiadis.

### 对格列索斯的诬陷继续被揭露  希腊当局惊慌不安阴谋赶快宣判

    对格列索斯的诬陷继续被揭露
    希腊当局惊慌不安阴谋赶快宣判
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社雅典15日讯：审讯格列索斯案件的军事法庭，在14日晚上和15日上午的审讯中结束了听取辩护证人和一个次要的原告证人证词的阶段。这个原告证人以前曾经提出过书面证词，后来是由于辩护人的要求才被传出庭的。
    14日的“马拉松”审讯（这是法庭上人们的称呼）从上午八时半起一直拖到午夜一点，中间只作了短暂的休息。鉴于全世界保卫格列索斯的运动日益高涨，法官们惊慌不安地急于结束这场审讯，以便使世界舆论面临格列索斯和其他被告被判决的既成事实。尤其使他们不安的是：每天的审讯都越来越多地揭露了对格列索斯和其他民主人士的审讯完全是警察的把戏。
    14日，格列索斯的妻子阿纳斯塔西娅和他的母亲迪米特罗卡利用新的材料驳斥了警察诬赖格列索斯曾同科里雅尼斯会面的谎言。阿纳斯塔西娅说，警察咬定8月16日晚间格列索斯曾同科里雅尼斯会谈，但是格列索斯当时其实同她在电影院里看电影。她说出了电影院的名字、地点和影片的名字。格列索斯的母亲说，格列索斯8月17日从早到晚都在腊菲纳。
    法庭庭长不顾对格列索斯的控告遭到了新的揭露，竟企图怀疑证词的价值，理由是这些证明是格列索斯的亲人提供的。
    在14日提供证词的还有格列索斯在统一民主左翼党里的同志、这个党的行政委员会的委员基齐基斯、阿夫格罗努洛斯和帕帕迪米特里乌，还有记者和统一民主左翼党的议员。他们谈到了格列索斯崇高的道德品质，谈到了他对希腊人民的无限忠诚、谈到了受希腊人民爱戴的统一民主左翼党对他的信任。
    15日起法庭庭长、法官和检察官开始审问被告。尽管法庭没有“证据”足以证明被告的“间谍”罪，但是他们企图用希腊共产党是“间谍组织”这样的说法来作为他们控告的根据。根据军事法庭的这种“法律基础”，只要它肯定这个或那个被告是共产党人，它就可以随心所欲地诬告他从事“间谍活动”；而凡是同被告进行任何接触也就成了“参与间谍活动的证据”。
    在这同时，希腊当局正在加紧镇压为保卫格列索斯和其他民主人士而斗争的希腊公众。统一民主左翼党行政委员会委员斯塔马蒂亚迪斯在14日被捕，有遭到流放的危险。
    统一民主左翼党主席帕萨利迪斯已经打电报给首相、内政大臣、司法大臣和各政党领袖，对统一民主左翼党领导人横遭逮捕一事提出抗议，并要求释放斯塔马蒂亚迪斯。
