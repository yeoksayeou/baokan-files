    Establishing "Double Rush Rescue Teams"
    Sixty-three medical personnel from sixteen large brigades, including Chongyi, Jiangtian, Qiaoxi, and Songlin of the Nanjiang Commune in Pingjiang, Hunan, formed ten double rush rescue teams. They carried emergency medications such as Rendan, Liu Yi San, Ten Drops of Water, and Cooling Pills, and went down to the fields to conduct mobile treatment activities.
    Recently, Yang Xiangbao, a member of the Wanjia Brigade, suffered from a sudden illness. Doctor Yang Weibao rushed over ten *li* overnight upon hearing the news and, after emergency treatment, cured Yang Xiangbao's illness. Young female medical workers Chen Xuehua and Wang Chuyun climbed mountains and crossed ridges, working from dawn till dusk, and treated more than 340 patients in ten days. The rescue team members regarded supporting the "double rush" as an extremely glorious political task, and their work enthusiasm was high. They delivered medicine to the fields and diagnosed illnesses on the edge of the fields. At the same time, the rescue team also trained more than 110 health workers, ensuring that every team had a doctor and medicine, and every group had a health room.

    成立“双抢救护队”
    湖南平江南江公社崇义、浆田、桥西、松林等十六个大队的六十三名白衣战士组成十个双抢救护队，携带了人丹、六一散、十滴水、清凉丹等急救药品，下到田间，开展了巡回治疗活动。
    最近，万家大队社员杨想保患了急症，杨伟伯医师闻讯后，连夜跑了十多里去抢救，经过急救，杨想保的病治好了。年轻的白衣女战士陈学华、王出云，爬山越岭，起早摸黑，十天治好了三百四十多个病人。救护队员们，把支援“双抢”当作极光荣的政治任务，工作劲头十足，做到了送药下田，在田墈诊病。同时，救护队还训练了一百一十多个保健员，做到了队队有医有药，组组有保健室。
