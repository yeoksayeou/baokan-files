A family in the Fields
In the Shiji Production Team of the Nanxi Commune in Yiyang County, on the shores of Dongting Lake, the sound of the rice-threshing tub "dong-dong" overwhelms everything. Looking from afar, a red flag flutters near a particularly lively rice-threshing tub. Here, four women have continuously set high work efficiency records for five days straight – each threshing more than 600 jin of unmilled rice per day. Today, Liu Meixiang, a tall poor peasant woman commune member, is engaged in a heated competition with her husband, Cao Xigui. Cao Xigui is also a skilled rice thresher, having been recognized on the honor roll in another production team. Liu Meixiang threshes rice quickly, with high quality, and such nimble movements, filling her threshing tub in just over twenty minutes, outperforming a man. As she vigorously scoops up the rice grains, she expresses her irrepressible joy: "This year, it's not even like threshing rice, it's like scooping it up in the fields! Look! After threshing only two sun-drying mats worth, it's already a full load!"

As she speaks, a large swathe of rice stalks is being harvested. The "dong-dong" sound of the rice-threshing tub is like a drum urging the troops onward, and the commune members swing their sickles even more enthusiastically. The girl in the production team who is harvesting the rice so quickly is none other than Liu Meixiang's eldest daughter. The two children picking up the scattered rice grains on the left are also theirs. It turns out that seven out of Liu Meixiang's family of eight are working in the fields, and each has been recognized on the honor roll. The commune members praise them as a "full house of red!" At this moment, Cao Xigui chimes in:
  "Everyone is happy in a year of good harvest, who can bear to stay at home? That one of mine (referring to his wife) is practically crazy, she pushes people out of bed before the rooster even crows!" His words elicit hearty laughter from everyone. Before the laughter subsides, a high-pitched mountain song drifts from the distant rice paddies: "A thousand miles of fragrant rice on the shores of the lake, joy everywhere with the bumper harvest, the early rice harvest surpasses the mid-season rice, we thank the Communist Party for the bumper harvest."

    田间一家人
    在洞庭湖滨的益阳县南溪公社石基生产队，扮禾桶咚咚的声响压倒了一切。远远望去，一张响得特别欢的扮禾桶附近飘着一面红旗。在这里已经有四名妇女连续五天创造了高工效纪录——每人每天扮六百多斤毛谷。今天，那个高个子的贫农妇女社员刘梅香，正和她的丈夫曹喜桂竞赛得火热。曹喜桂也是个扮禾的好手，在另一个生产队里登上了光荣榜。刘梅香扮起禾来工效快、质量高、动作又是那样敏捷，只用了二十多分钟，她的扮禾桶就满了，赛过一个男子汉。她一面用劲地撮谷子，一面倾吐着抑制不住的喜悦：“今年简直不是扮谷子，是在田里撮谷子，你看！才扮两床晒簟大，就是满满的一担谷！”
    说话之间，眼看前面一大片稻禾又被割完了。扮禾桶咚咚的响声，像是催阵鼓，社员手中的镰刀越抡越欢。生产队那个禾割得飞快的姑娘正是刘梅香的大女儿；靠左边正在捡禾籼的两个小孩，也都是他们的，原来刘梅香一家八口，就有七个人出工下了田，个个都登上了光荣榜，社员夸奖他们是全家满堂红！这时，曹喜桂也开腔了：
  “丰收年头人人乐，那个能在家里蹲得住呢？我那一个（指他妻子）简直像发了疯，今早鸡还没叫，就把人推起床来！”他这一说，引得大家哈哈大笑。笑声未落，远处稻田里传来了高吭的山歌声：“湖滨千里稻谷香，处处丰收喜洋洋，早稻收成赛中稻，丰收感谢共产党。”
