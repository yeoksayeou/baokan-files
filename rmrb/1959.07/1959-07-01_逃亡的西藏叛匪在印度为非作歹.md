Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 30th - The Bengali newspaper "Freedom," published in Calcutta, reported on the 27th that farmers in villages near the "Tibetan Refugee Camp" in Misamari, Assam, eastern India, are now terrified by the crimes committed by "Tibetan refugees."

The report said that at present, farmers spend most of their time engaged in field sowing and other work. Women and children left at home have no protection. Those Tibetan bandits who fled there take the opportunity to enter the villages and, regardless of the women's protests, steal firewood and other things stored by the farmers for use during the rainy season. They have repeatedly forcibly cut down bamboo and valuable trees planted by farmers. The situation has developed to such an extent that protecting rural women from being raped by "Tibetan refugees" has become a major responsibility. About forty-one farmer leaders in these villages have asked the Indian authorities to intervene immediately and restore normalcy there.

    逃亡的西藏叛匪在印度为非作歹
    新华社新德里30日电　在加尔各答出版的孟加拉文“自由报”27日报道，印度东部阿萨姆邦米萨马里的“西藏难民营”附近各村庄的农民们现在对“西藏难民”为非作歹的行为感到恐惧。
    报道说，目前农民们把绝大部分的时间都用来从事田间播种等工作。留在家里的妇女和孩子没有人保护。那些逃到那里的西藏歹徒们就乘机进入村庄，不顾妇女们的抗议，把农民贮存起来准备在雨季使用的木柴等东西抢走。他们多次强行砍掉农民种的竹子和贵重的树木。情况已经发展到这样的程度：保护农村妇女使她们不被“西藏难民”强奸，已经成为一个重大的责任。这些村庄的大约四十一位农民领袖已经要求印度当局立即进行干预，恢复那里的正常状态。
