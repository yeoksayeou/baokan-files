Reading "The Turbulent Years"
Xu Chi

闻捷's long poem "Flames of Revenge," the first part, "The Turbulent Years" (published in the third issue of this year's "Harvest"), has already attracted the attention of readers.

Some comrades say it belongs to the category of poetic novels. I think that's a fair assessment. But "Flames of Revenge" may even deserve to be called an epic. This is not only due to its content but also its meter. Of course, it is mainly due to its content, its historical content: this work sings of the historical events and national life of our socialist revolutionary era. But in terms of poetic form and meter, it also makes a contribution.

闻捷 mentions twice in this long poem a sentence from Chairman Mao's opening speech at the first session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never be reconciled to their defeat, and they will make their final struggle..." 闻捷 uses this sentence as the epigraph to the third chapter and also writes it in the postscript. This speaks to the theme of the work. The work describes a reactionary rebellion by the US-Chiang armed spy 乌斯满. This was yet another final struggle by reactionary forces at home and abroad after Xinjiang was peacefully liberated by the Chinese people in 1949. It is very meaningful that 闻捷 chose such a subject and such a theme for his creation. This work was published when the gunfire in Lhasa, Tibet, had just subsided. This shows that reactionaries at home and abroad are never willing to accept their defeat. But their last struggles still ended in shameful failure. 闻捷 writes of a historical lesson.

I say this work may deserve to be called an epic because it also has the majestic bearing of an epic. Just as lines like "Bright moon rises from the Tianshan Mountains, amidst a vast sea of clouds" convey a heroic atmosphere, which is what an epic requires. Although only one part of this trilogy has been written, it can still give us some insight into this point. "Flames of Revenge" begins with a picture of the First Field Army of the People's Liberation Army advancing westward in two routes in the summer of 1949, "no beginning in sight, no end in sight, two divine dragons soaring in the high mountains." This is a magnificent momentum. In the second chapter, which describes the quiet 巴里坤 grassland, it first depicts the thirteen hunters appearing like eagles in the sunset of the Tianshan Mountains, "riding on horseback, as majestic as snow-capped mountains." In the third chapter, the beginning describes the days before the founding of the nation, September 26, 1949, at 怀仁堂 in Beijing, when the good news of the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang arrived. The Xinjiang representatives presented gifts to Chairman Mao amidst cheers:

	Chairman Mao put on an embroidered 杜帕,
	And draped a 袷袢 made of 和阗 silk over his shoulders,
	The mercury lamps in the entire hall suddenly shone brightly,
	All the lenses focused on him.
What a solemn moment. Readers will feel that this work not only in its structure but also in some chapters conveys the magnificent and varied atmosphere of our era.

An epic also needs another characteristic: speed. This is linked to a huge structure and majestic bearing and cannot be separated. If it is an epic with such great spirit but progresses slowly, the reader will not be able to bear it. A great river flows rapidly. The progress of an epic needs to be faster. In this way, "Flames of Revenge" also has this characteristic of speed. The development of its events and the progress of the plot are very rapid. Taking the westward advance of the People's Liberation Army as an example, the first section of the first chapter describes the westward advance, and in the second section, we hear the liberation of Lanzhou from the radio of the American Vice-Consul 马克南. In the third section, we read about the enlarged meeting of the Lanzhou Front Committee, and in the fifth section, the British Consul reports to 马克南: "The 共军 have advanced from 武威 to 酒泉." The second chapter mainly describes grassland life, but the reader can still feel the speed of the advance of the liberation army: -- People on the grassland are lowering their voices, "talking about the artillery fire inside 玉门关." And at the end of this chapter, the smoke of 玉门关 "finally drifted across 星星峡 and the Tianshan Mountains."

Of course, grandeur and speed are just two formal attributes of an epic, two characteristics of performance techniques. In an epic or narrative long poem, the most important thing is to shape characters. This is certainly a common requirement of general literary works, but in an epic, we ask to see not just one or a few portraits but an entire gallery. And in the method of shaping, it cannot use as much space as a novel. It does not need many lines of poetry, nor can it use many lines of poetry. It has its own shaping method.

"Flames of Revenge" also satisfies the reader in this regard. As of the publication of this epic, we can say that we have not yet read a narrative long poem that depicts so many characters. 闻捷 portrays dozens of characters for us. He portrays commanders, division commanders, regiment commanders, and soldiers. He depicts the scene of Commander 彭德怀 presiding over an enlarged meeting of the Front Committee in a hall at the foot of 皋兰 Mountain and his image. He described 彭总 wearing ordinary soldier's uniforms, his steady and powerful steps in the hall, "staring for a long time at the vast 甘宁青新" in front of the military map, and then his loud and deep voice sounded. Later, 闻捷 also shaped the solemn image of 彭总 through the memories of Infantry Division Commander 任锐 and Regiment Commander 胡大成.

The above are the historical content of this work, a huge historical picture. But the main plot of the work unfolds under the Tianshan Mountains, on the quiet 巴里坤 grassland. 闻捷 describes the wind and snow on the grassland, the danger of the snowy Tianshan Mountains, and contrasts the poverty and oppressed life of the herdsmen in the 乃曼 tribe with the life of the chieftains on brightly colored and beautifully patterned花毡.

The herdsman 巴哈尔 of the 乃曼 tribe, one of the protagonists of this long poem, has an extremely distinct image. He is majestic and fierce:

	Two thick eyebrows like summer clouds,
	Lightning flashing under the clouds.
His victory over a snowstorm immediately makes us feel that he is our blue eagle, and his horsemanship in winning the ?? race also makes us feel that he is our hero. But when the story develops into a love twist, the mountain eagle suddenly becomes a bear. This is absolutely unexpected by the readers. Thus, the herdsman 巴哈尔 on the quiet 巴里坤 grassland is a bit like the Cossack 格莱高里 in "Quiet Don." He became a loyal servant of the chieftain and finally became a reactionary rebel. A tall image is reduced to a pitiful dwarf. But we can already feel in advance that 巴哈尔 cannot end up like 格莱高里. 巴哈尔 was deceived, and it can be seen that he will turn back. 巴哈尔, the main character, will not be absent in the second part of the long poem, "The Rebellious Grassland," and the third part, "The Awakened People."

When 闻捷's pen writes about the Tianshan Mountains and the life of the grassland, so many characters appear vividly on the paper. Uncle 布鲁巴 is a kind-hearted old herdsman who understands human relationships and sings good songs. 巴哈尔's younger sister, 叶尔纳, is particularly lovely because of her boldness and enthusiasm. 阿尔布满金, the chieftain of the 乃曼 tribe, is repulsive. His friend 阿尔勒毛拉 also fails to win people's sympathy.

But 巴哈尔's beloved girl, another protagonist of the long poem,

	苏丽亚 is so beautiful today,
	The eagle feather on her purple hat is constantly trembling,
	She is wearing a sky-blue dress,
	And a black vest embroidered with golden patterns.
苏丽亚 is not only beautiful. On this very night, 巴哈尔 played the 东不拉 and sang about 苏丽亚's background. In dealing with 苏丽亚's background, 闻捷 first let Uncle 布鲁巴 reveal some, then let Aunt 法伊札 leak some from her mouth, and finally implied it from 巴哈尔's singing. This ingenious technique has a good effect. It is said hesitantly, but everyone understands. She arouses our sympathy even more. 苏丽亚's qualities are even higher than 巴哈尔's in her later relationship with 巴哈尔. Just the opposite of 巴哈尔's situation, 苏丽亚's image was not very good at first, but the more it goes on, the more attractive, the more lovely, and the more sublime it becomes. But 苏丽亚's character is only initially developed in the first part and has not been fully developed.

In addition, Aunt 法伊札's good character is shown because of 苏丽亚's misfortune, but also because of her own lonely life experience. When the working group of the People's Liberation Army came to the 乃曼 tribe, her son 沙尔拜, who had been missing for five years, also returned. He is a national cadre wearing a red five-star hat, a soldier of the People's Liberation Army. The herdsmen warmly welcomed him. But, inevitably, there is a little regret:

	沙尔拜 is like a rooster,
	Standing in the center of the tent with his neck tilted.
闻捷 has obviously put a lot of effort into portraying the characters. The negative characters, such as 乌斯满, are very vivid when they first appear, "乌斯满 is like a hibernating bear." And 乌斯满's head, which then appears in the dim light, is hateful and frightening:

	The raised cheekbones are inlaid with a flat nose,
	The dark brown face is covered with grassland frost;
In addition, the ugly images of American Consul 马克南 and his mistress 尤丽, British Consul 何仁志, as well as 蒋介石 and special agent chief 郑介民 on 草山, Taipei, are all depicted with vivid brushstrokes.

So many characters, in a turbulent era, on a vast and extensive land, unfold an unusually complex contradiction and struggle. This is rarely seen in our long poem creation. Here, the main contradiction is manifested in this rebellion. "National consciousness has confused the hearts of the riders, and religious concepts have blinded the eyes of the chieftains," which allowed the US-Chiang spy 乌斯满 to incite the rebellion. But before that, we saw the sharp class contradictions in the 乃曼 tribe. The abuse and persecution of 巴哈尔 and 苏丽亚 by the chieftain 阿尔布满金 had aroused the anger of all the herdsmen in the tribe. They were gradually approaching the chieftain's tent. But at this time, 阿勒尔毛拉, a friend of the chieftain, rushed over, tried them in the name of the religious court, and pardoned 巴哈尔. He not only stabilized the almost erupting contradiction but also won the cheers of some herdsmen. It was from this time that 巴哈尔 became a bear. A dark spot appeared in the relationship between 苏丽亚 and 巴哈尔. And after 沙尔拜 came back, he immediately became an enemy of 巴哈尔, his childhood friend. 闻捷 tells us that the quiet grassland is full of contradictions and conflicts.

The process of 乌斯满's rebellion is also unfolded through such a series of contradictions. There are contradictions between the US and British consuls, and there are contradictions between the US and Chiang. They all have specific plots. 马克南's gaining 乌斯满's trust is bold and vigorous, and he does not hesitate to spend money and break the pot. And the direct fuse that caused the 乃曼 tribe to participate in the rebellion was because 沙尔拜 made a mistake. In order to help the widow 萨尔琳, he had a conflict with the chieftain 阿尔布满金. He violated the policy and said what he shouldn't have said.

At the end of the first part of the epic, the rebellious cavalry of the 乃曼 tribe, including 巴哈尔, set off to gather at 红柳峡, the location designated by 乌斯满. The rebellion is about to begin, although it has not yet begun. However, 闻捷 only used extremely concise epic-like techniques to write twelve lines to tell us that in the 乃曼 tribe, another small group of herdsmen formed a team and headed for 巴里坤 city, including Uncle 布鲁巴, Aunt 法伊札, 苏丽亚, 萨尔琳... The tribe itself has also become divided, which makes the end of the long poem full of a sense of "the mountain rain is coming, and the wind is filling the building."

That's all I'll say about the content.

The language of the long poem "Flames of Revenge" also has characteristics: there are many good sentences, many aphorisms, and many poems. For example, in the third section of the third chapter, when 乌斯满's two confidants came to his tent and saw the female spy 尤丽, one respectfully called her "a bright moon: 'Now is the time for you to hide in the clouds,'" and the other echoed, "Now only those meteors who like to go out at night are wandering wantonly in the dark blue sky." Understanding their hints, 尤丽 coldly replied: "Whether it is a meteor or a moon, you can always see it but can't reach it," and then she walked out of the tent. These languages ​​can be said to be rich and have a national flavor. But there are also some chapters in the poem that are not refined enough and have the shortcomings of prose.

I would also like to talk about its poetic form and meter. Now, the poetry circle is paying more attention to the issue of the form of poetry; many theorists are exploring the meter of poetry. Relatively speaking, poets speak less on this issue, but poets speak with their works. Meter is precisely to be constructed by the works of poets. It is difficult for us to imagine that a long epic has no meter. Such a work, solely due to this point, is unlikely to succeed. Precisely because the work is larger, the requirements for meter are more urgent.

"Flames of Revenge" is divided into three parts. The first part, which has been written, has a total of six chapters; each chapter is divided into several sections; each section is divided into several subsections. Each subsection has four lines. Generally speaking, each line has four beats, with alternating rhymes. In some subsections, one line out of the four lines has five beats. More than five thousand lines are of this meter, which makes the work more complete in form and has the style of an epic. And from beginning to end, creating with a relatively complete meter is a great contribution to exploring the poetic form and meter. This meter, I feel, seems to be basically consistent with the requirements put forward by Comrade He Qifang. For example, the first section of the whole poem has four beats per line:

	The July | sun | spews | sparks,
	Burning in | the eight hundred | li | of Qin Chuan,
	The scorched | crops | rustle | loudly,
	The land | cracks | into | cracks.
In "On Metrical Poetry" (published in the June issue of "Poetry"), I mentioned that 闻捷 had a tendency to write metrical poetry early on, and also said that he was not very consciously arranging beats and rhymes according to meter. But we can be sure that he consciously pursued fluent and rhythmic language. All fluent and rhythmic language must have a relatively neat meter, and it sounds better to read with ups and downs. But conversely, it must also be explained that a poem with meter is not necessarily a fluent poem. Therefore, some people advocate that meter is necessary but can also be broken through. In this way, although 闻捷's poem is based on four beats per line as the basic meter, he is relatively free when writing and is not restricted by meter; many lines do not follow this four-beat meter and have five or even six beats. I think five beats are already a little more for our language, and six beats are too much. For example, there is such a subsection in the second section of the fourth chapter.

	苏丽亚 | saw | the shadow | of the shed,
	Suddenly | woke | up | and quickly | turned |
	    around,
	But | 巴哈尔 | that pair | of hot | and powerful
	   | arms,
	Had | hugged | her | tightly | in | his arms...
If arranged like this:

	苏丽亚 | saw | the shadow | of the shed,
	Suddenly | woke up | and quickly | turned
	    around,
	But | 巴哈尔 | those hot | arms,
	Had hugged | her tightly | in | his arms...
It may sound more comfortable and give people a more neat feeling. But we always advocate that meter is created by poets for their own needs, and meter must not be allowed to bind the poet's poetic feelings. 闻捷 certainly understands this principle. The poetic form of the whole poem has rules but is not rigid, and the meter is quite neat, solemn, and grand, but it does not seem to hinder the poetic feelings.

闻捷's long poem has such creations in content and meter, so it is a relatively successful work. As for what to call it, whether it is called a poetic novel, an epic, or something else, it does not matter.

Now, as we wait for his second and third parts, I would like to make a request to 闻捷: In the continued development of this epic, can it be more concentrated and more refined? If some of the content in the first part is written with fewer lines of poetry, and if more content than is currently available is summarized with fewer lines of poetry, I think this work will be even more outstanding. I don't think this is impossible. In the future, when the whole poem is completed, can the author refine the first part again? The content summarized by "Pipa Xing" is certainly much smaller but also quite rich, but it only wrote eighty-eight lines, and it is vivid and lifelike. The Greek epic "Iliad" is very long, but only forty-one lines are written about Helen going to the city tower, and it has become the most famous fragment. A long poem of more than 10,000 lines is always long. Striving for refinement, I think there is no harm, only good, I wonder what 闻捷 thinks?

    读“动荡的年代”
    徐迟
    闻捷的长诗“复仇的火焰”第一部“动荡的年代”（发表在今年的“收获”第三期）已经吸引了读者的注意。
    有的同志说，它属于诗体小说之列。我想，可以这样说。但“复仇的火焰”也许够得上称为一部史诗了。这不仅由于它的内容，也由于它的格律。当然，主要是由于它的内容，它的历史内容：这部作品里歌唱的是我们这社会主义革命时代的历史事件和民族生活。但在诗体上，在格律上，它也有所贡献。
    闻捷在这首长诗里两次提到了毛主席在中国人民政协首届会议的开幕词中一句话：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎……”。闻捷既用这句话作第三章的扉语，又把它写在后记中。这说出了这部作品的主题。这部作品写的是美蒋武装间谍乌斯满的一次反动叛乱。这是1949年中国人民和平解放了新疆以后，国内外反动势力的又一次最后挣扎。闻捷选择这样一个题材和这样一个主题来进行创作是很有意义的。这部作品发表的时候，西藏拉萨的枪声刚刚平息。可见国内外的反动派总不肯甘心于他们的失败。但他们的最后挣扎还是以可耻的失败而告终的。闻捷写的是历史的殷鉴。
    我说这部作品也许够得上称为一部史诗还因为它具有史诗的宏伟的仪态。好比“明月出天山，苍茫云海间”这样的诗句传达出雄壮的气象一样，这是史诗所要求的。虽然这三部曲只写出了一部来，却多少能够让我们看出这一点了。“复仇的火焰”以1949年夏天人民解放军第一野战军两路向西挺进的画幅开端，“前不见头，后不见尾，两条神龙飞腾在崇山峻岭”。这是气势雄浑的。在第二章写到静静的巴里坤草原时，先写那天山夕阳里像雄鹰一样翻飞出现的十三个猎人“骑在马上，威严得有如载雪的山峦”。到了第三章，开头写的是开国的前几天，1949年9月26日，在北京的怀仁堂上，和平解放新疆的捷报传来了。新疆代表在欢呼声中，给毛主席献礼：
    毛主席戴上绣花的杜帕，
    又把和阗绸缝制的袷袢披在肩上，
    全场的水银灯忽然大放光明，
    一切镜头都集中在他身上。这是何等庄严的时刻。读者将能感到这部作品不仅仅是在结构上，而且在一些章节里传达了我们这时代的气象万千，仪态万方。
    史诗还少不了另一个特点：速度。这是和巨大的结构、宏伟的仪态联在一起，分不开来的。如果是这样气概宏大的史诗，却进展得缓慢，读者就会受不了。大河流急。史诗的进展需要迅速一些。正是这样，“复仇的火焰”也有这速度的特点。它的事件的发展，情节的进行是很迅速的。以人民解放军的西进为例，第一章的第一节写西进，第二节我们就从美国副领事马克南的收音机里听到兰州的解放。三节里我们读到了兰州的前委扩大会议，第五节里，英国领事就向马克南报告：“共军又从武威挺进酒泉”。第二章里，主要是写草原生活的，可是读者仍然能感到解放大军的进军速度：——草原上的人们在压低了嗓门，“谈到玉门关内的炮火”。而这一章结束处，玉门关内的硝烟“终于飘过了星星峡和天山”。
    当然，宏伟和速度不过是史诗的两个形式上的属性，两个表现技巧上的特点罢了。在史诗、叙事长诗中，最重要的是塑造人物。这固然是一般文学作品的共同的要求，但在史诗中，我们要求看到的不单单是一个或几个肖像，而是一整个画廊。而在塑造的方法上，也不像小说那样可以用相当的篇幅。它不要用多少诗行的，也用不了多少诗行的。它有它自己的塑造方法。
      “复仇的火焰”也在这个要求上满足了读者。截至这部史诗的发表时为止，我们可以说，确实还没有读到一部叙事长诗描绘了这样多人物的。闻捷为我们描绘了几十个人物。他描绘司令员，师长，团长和战士。他描绘了皋兰山下一座大厅里，彭德怀司令员在主持前委扩大会议的情景和他的形象。他描写了彭总穿着的普通的士兵制服，在大厅里的稳健有力的步伐，在军事地图前“长久地凝视辽阔的甘宁青新”，而后响起了他洪亮的深沉的声音。稍后，闻捷还通过步兵师长任锐和团长胡大成的回忆来塑造彭总的庄严的形象。
    前述种种是这部作品的历史内容，巨幅的历史图画。但作品的主要情节，却在天山下，在静静的巴里坤草原上展开。闻捷描绘了草原上的风雪，风雪天山的凶险，对照了一个部落，乃曼部落里的牧人的贫困、受压迫的生活和头人们在色彩鲜艳，图案美丽的花毡上的生活。
    有极其鲜明的形象的是乃曼部落的牧人巴哈尔，这部长诗的主人公之一。他威严而又剽悍：
    两道浓眉有如盛夏的乌云，
    乌云下面亮着闪电。
    通过他的战胜一场风雪，便立刻使我们感到，他是我们的蓝色的鹰，通过他赛马夺得??的骑术，也使我们感到他是我们的英雄。但在故事发展到爱情的波折时，山鹰忽然变成了一头狗熊。这是读者们绝对意想不到的。于是，静静的巴里坤草原上的牧人巴哈尔，有点儿像“静静的顿河”里的哥萨克人格莱高里。他变成了头人的一个忠顺的奴仆，最后变成了反动叛乱者。一个高大的形象就缩小成为一个可怜的侏儒了。但是我们已经预先能感觉到，巴哈尔是不能够像格莱高里那样的下场的。巴哈尔是受了骗，看得出来他还会回头。在长诗的第二部“叛乱的草原”和第三部“觉醒的人们”中都不会没有巴哈尔这个主要人物的。
    在闻捷的笔写到天山下，写到草原生活时，那末多的人物跃然出现在纸上。布鲁巴大叔是个好心肠的老牧人，通晓人情，又唱得好歌曲。巴哈尔的妹妹叶尔纳是因为豪爽热烈而显得特别可爱的。乃曼部落的头人阿尔布满金使人憎恶。他的朋友阿尔勒毛拉也并不能博得人们的同情。
    但是巴哈尔的心爱的姑娘，长诗的另一个主人公，
    苏丽亚今天是多末漂亮，
    紫花帽上的鹰毛不住颤动，
    她穿着一件天青色的连衣裙，
    黑坎肩上绣满金色花纹。苏丽亚不仅是美的。就在这天晚上，巴哈尔弹着东不拉，唱出了苏丽亚的身世。在处理苏丽亚的身世时，闻捷先让布鲁巴大叔泄露一些，又从法伊札大婶口中漏出一些，最后才从巴哈尔的歌声中暗示出来。这种巧妙的手法有很好的效果，说的吞吞吐吐，可是谁都明白了。她就更加激起了我们的同情。苏丽亚的品质还在她和巴哈尔后来的关系上显出来比巴哈尔高贵得多。刚好和巴哈尔的情况相反，苏丽亚的形象最初是并不怎末的，但越到后面，越吸引人，越可爱，越崇高。可是苏丽亚的性格在第一部里只有初步的展开，还没有充分的展开。
    此外，法伊札大婶的良善的性格，则是由于苏丽亚的不幸而显示的，但也由于她自己的孤苦伶仃的身世。当解放军的工作组来到乃曼部落时，她的失踪了五年的儿子沙尔拜也回来了。他是一个头戴红五星帽子的民族干部，解放军的战士。牧人热烈地欢迎了他。但是，不免有点遗憾：
    沙尔拜像只大公鸡，
    歪着脖子站在帐篷中心。
    闻捷在描绘人物时，显然是下了很大的工夫的。反面人物，如乌斯满，最初出场就很形象，“乌斯满像一只冬眠的熊”。而跟着出现在昏黄的灯光里的乌斯满的头像，令人憎恶又恐惧：
    突起的颧骨嵌着扁平的鼻子，
    褐黑的脸盘染满草原风霜；此外，美国领事马克南和他的情妇尤丽，英国领事何仁志，以及台北草山的蒋介石和特务头子郑介民，这些人的丑恶的形象都被用鲜明的笔触描绘出来了。
    这样多的人物，在一个动荡的年代，在一片辽阔广大的土地上，展开了异常错综复杂的矛盾和斗争。这在我们的长诗创作中也是很少看到的。这里，主要的矛盾表现在这一场叛乱上。“民族意识迷惑了骑手的心，宗教观念蒙蔽了头人的眼睛”，这就让美蒋间谍乌斯满把叛乱煽动了起来。但在这之前，我们就看到了乃曼部落里的尖锐的阶级矛盾。头人阿尔布满金对巴哈尔和苏丽亚的虐待和迫害，曾经激起了部落内全体牧人的愤怒。他们已一步步地向头人的帐篷逼近。但这时赶来了头人的朋友阿勒尔毛拉，用宗教法庭的名义审判了，并宽恕了巴哈尔。他不仅稳住了几乎爆发的矛盾，而且还赢得了一些牧人的欢呼。就是从这一次以后，巴哈尔变成了狗熊。苏丽亚和巴哈尔的感情中间也就出现了黑点。而沙尔拜回来后，也立即变成了他童年时代的朋友巴哈尔的仇人。闻捷告诉我们静静的草原上是充满了矛盾和冲突的。
    乌斯满的叛乱的过程也是通过了这样一系列的矛盾来展开的。美英领事之间有矛盾，美蒋之间有矛盾。它们都有具体的情节。马克南的取得乌斯满的信任是大胆泼辣的，是不惜工本，破釜沉舟的。而造成乃曼部落参加叛乱的直接导火线，却是因为沙尔拜犯了一个错误。为了援助寡妇萨尔琳，他和头人阿尔布满金发生了冲突，他违反了政策，说了不该说的话。
    史诗第一部的结束处，乃曼部落的叛乱的骑兵，其中有巴哈尔，出发向乌斯满指定的地点红柳峡集中去了。叛乱即将开始，虽然还没有开始。可是，闻捷只用极其简洁的史诗一般的手法写了十二行，就告诉了我们，乃曼部落中，另有一小部分牧人结成一支队伍奔向巴里坤城，其中有布鲁巴大叔，法伊札大婶，有苏丽亚、有萨尔琳……这个部落的本身也发生了分化，这使长诗结束处充满了“山雨欲来风满楼”之感。
    关于内容部分，就说到这里。
    长诗“复仇的火焰”的语言也有特点：有不少的佳句，有不少的警句，有不少的诗。例如，在第三章的第三节里，乌斯满的两个心腹人来到他的帐篷中，看到尤丽这个女间谍时，一个尊称她是“明媚的月亮：‘现在已到你躲进云层的时候’”，另一个帮腔道，“现在只有那喜欢夜游的流星，才放荡地在暗蓝的天空游逛。”懂得了他们的暗示，尤丽冷笑回答：“无论流星还是月亮，你们永远看得见但是够不上，”说完才走出帐篷去。这些语言可以说是丰富的，而且有民族的味道。但诗中也有一些章节不够精炼，有散文化的缺点。
    我还想谈一谈它的诗体和格律。现在，诗歌界更加注意诗歌的形式问题；许多理论家在作诗歌格律的探索。相对的说来，诗人在这问题上发言较少，但诗人是以他们的作品来发言的。格律正是要诗人的作品来建设的。我们很难设想一部长大的史诗没有什么格律。这样的作品，仅由于这一点，也就很少可能成功。正由于作品较大，格律的要求就愈加迫切。
    “复仇的火焰”分三部。已经写成的第一部，一共六章；每一章又分成几节；每一节又分若干小节。每小节四行。大体上，是每行四顿，间行押韵。有一些小节，四行中有一行是五顿的。五千多行都是这样的格律，就使得这部作品形式上更加完整，具有史诗的风格了。而自始至终，用一个比较完整的格律进行创作，对于探索诗体和格律，也就很有贡献，这种格律。我感到，似乎和何其芳同志所提出的要求基本上一致，如全诗的第一节，是每行四顿：
    七月的｜太阳｜喷射｜火星，
    燃烧在｜八百里｜秦川的｜大关中，
    焦黄的｜庄稼｜沙沙地｜发响，
    土地｜裂开｜一道道｜龟纹。我在“谈格律诗”（发表于“诗刊”六月号）中，曾说到闻捷早有这种写格律诗的倾向，也说了他并不是十分有意识地按照格律来安排顿和韵的。但我们可以肯定他是十分有意识地追求了流畅而有节奏的语言的。凡流畅而有节奏的语言，必然有比较整齐的格律，念起来抑扬顿挫，也就比较好听。但反过来，也要说明一下，有格律的诗，却并不一定是流畅的诗。所以有人主张，格律是必要的，但也是可以突破的。这样，闻捷这诗，虽然是以每行大体上四顿为基本格律的，但他写作时还比较自由，不受格律的拘束；许多行没有按照这四顿的格律，有五顿甚至六顿的。我想，五顿对我们的语言来说已经多一点了，六顿未免太多。例如第四章第二节里有这样一小节。
    苏丽亚｜看到｜草棚的｜阴影，
    猛然｜清醒｜过来｜迅速地｜向回｜
        转身，
    但是｜巴哈尔｜那双｜灼热｜有力的
       ｜臂膀，
    已经｜将她｜紧紧｜搂在｜怀中……如这样安排：
        苏丽亚｜看到｜草棚的｜阴影，
        猛然｜清醒了｜迅速地｜回转
            身，
        但是｜巴哈尔｜那灼热的｜臂
            膀，
        已将她｜紧紧地｜搂在｜怀中………念起来也许可以更加舒畅些，给人的感觉也会更加整齐。但我们始终主张格律是诗人为自己的需要而创造的，决不能让格律来束缚了诗人的诗情。闻捷当然了解这个道理，全诗的诗体有规则而并不呆板，格律相当整齐、庄重、堂皇，而看来并没有妨碍诗情。
    闻捷这部长诗在内容和格律上有了这样的创造，因此是比较成功的作品，至于称它什么，称它诗体小说、史诗，或别的什么，并不重要。
    现在，在我们等待他的第二部、第三部的时候，我想对闻捷提一个要求：在这部史诗的继续向前发展时，是否能使它更加集中起来，更加精炼一些。如果像第一部里这样的一些内容用更少一些诗行就写出来了，如果用更少一些诗行，而又概括了比现有的还更多的内容，我想这部作品就会更出色。我觉得这不是不可能的。将来全诗完成，作者是否能对第一部再作一些锤炼？《琵琶行》概括的内容当然小得多，但也相当丰富，却只写了八十八行，而绘声绘影。希腊史诗《依利阿德》是很长的，但写海伦上城楼只有四十一行，而成为最著名的片段。一部长诗一万多行，总是长了。力求其精炼，我想没有坏处，只有好处，不知闻捷以为如何？
