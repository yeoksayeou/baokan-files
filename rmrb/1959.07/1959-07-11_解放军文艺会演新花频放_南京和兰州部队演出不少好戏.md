The People's Liberation Army Art Performance is blossoming with new talent. The Nanjing and Lanzhou troop performances have many good shows.

(Reported by this newspaper) In the Second PLA Art Performance, "Overture to the Eastward Advance" performed recently by the Nanjing Troops Representative Team and the opera "Red Eagle" performed by the Lanzhou Troops Representative Team were quite inspiring. At the same time, some outstanding programs continue to emerge during the performance and are very popular.

"Overture to the Eastward Advance" is based on a true historical event of the New Fourth Army's resistance against Japan in northern Jiangsu. The playwrights are Gu Baozhang (one of the authors of the movie "South征北战 [Southward Battles, Northward Fights]") and Suo Yunping (author of the plays "Water Flows Upward" and "On the Road Forward"), both creative cadres from the Nanjing Troops' Frontline Drama Troupe. The historical backdrop of this play is 1940, when the Kuomintang, under the Japanese invaders' policy of luring surrender, launched an anti-communist high tide, and a serious crisis emerged in the anti-Japanese situation in northern Jiangsu. In order to save the anti-Japanese situation in northern Jiangsu, our New Fourth Army dispatched the Eastward Advance Contingent across the river. After crushing the Japanese invaders' mopping-up operations in Daqiao, they liberated the Japanese invaders' stronghold of Qiaotou Town, rescued the suffering people, and stabilized the anti-Japanese situation in northern Jiangsu. However, at this moment, Kuomintang diehards and local forces, under the secret activities of representatives of the Nanjing Wang puppet government, reached an agreement to annihilate our troops during the Japanese invaders' mopping-up operations. In order to unite against Japan, our army repeatedly exercised restraint and sent a negotiation representative to "Emissary to Jiangzhou" and "debated the diehards." However, the diehards were eager to oppose communism, refused peace talks, detained our representative, and launched an attack on Qiaotou Town, where the New Fourth Army's eastward advance vanguard contingent was stationed, firing the first shot of the civil war. Our military and civilians fought bravely and repelled the diehards' attack, capturing the enemy's one column commander. At this time, another column commander on the diehard side, with national consciousness, announced an uprising with the help of our army's persuasion and underground party members, making the diehards isolated and facing a dangerous situation. At this time, in order to unite against Japan, our army took the initiative to stop the offensive, and finally prompted the diehards to abandon the anti-communist surrender plot and fight against Japan with us.

Through complex contradictions and conflicts, this play profoundly embodies the greatness of the Party and Chairman Mao's policy of the anti-Japanese national united front. The structure of the whole play is relatively rigorous, the plot is tense, and the theme is prominent. Through the creation of director Shi Yan and actors Xu Linge, Zhang Xian, and others, each of the main characters is lifelike and gripping from beginning to end. In particular, the scenes of "Emissary to Jiangzhou" and "Debating the Diehards" are especially wonderful.

The opera "Red Eagle," written and performed by the Lanzhou Troops' Combat Cultural Troupe, is also a good show that has appeared in the performance these days. This play depicts the deeds of Comrade Lin Hua, the political instructor of a health team of a certain unit of the Red Army during the Long March, who was wounded and lost contact with the main force and stayed in the Tibetan area to guide the Tibetan people in their struggle.

The play begins with a scene on the vast grassland, where a group of Red Army soldiers and Lin Hua are pursued by the Kuomintang and Ma Bufang's bandit army, fighting and retreating. Then, in the tense battle situation, Lin Hua falls wounded in order to cover the retreat of others. From then on, she began to encounter this situation: she could be arrested and killed by Ma bandits at any time, and she could also be mistakenly killed by Tibetans who did not understand the Red Army at any time. How will she live? This is what the audience is very concerned about. Then, around the protagonist's encounters and fate, the contradictions between the Tibetan people and the Qianhu (thousand-household head) and the headmen, including the contradictions between the entire tribe including the headmen and the Kuomintang Ma bandits, are unfolded layer by layer. The most valuable thing about the script is that in the climax of the contradiction in each act, it shows the audience the great feelings of this communist who is always for the benefit of the Tibetan people, regardless of personal life, death, honor and disgrace. Although, because the Qianhu killed the Ma bandit representative who exploited the Tibetan people in a rage, the Ma bandits sent troops to bloodbath the Baihe Grassland, the Tibetan people rose up, and the Qianhu had to accept Lin Hua's suggestion to withdraw the troops to the South Mountain, but after the test of time and struggle, he finally became ungrateful and wanted to kill Lin Hua and join the Kuomintang. At this time, Lin Hua had already taken root among the masses, and the masses had also realized from actual struggle that following who is the only way to liberation for the Tibetan people. They elected the tribal hero and Red Army military doctor Lin Hua to lead everyone to continue the struggle.

The advantage of this opera is first of all the successful portrayal of the characters, and it also better embodies the Party's ethnic policy. Secondly, it is very suitable for opera performance. Furthermore, the center of the whole play is prominent, and all contradictions are always around the fate of the protagonist. Coupled with the creation of music and actors, it better completed the task provided by the script. (Attached pictures)

### 解放军文艺会演新花频放  南京和兰州部队演出不少好戏

    解放军文艺会演新花频放
    南京和兰州部队演出不少好戏
    本报讯　在解放军第二届文艺会演中，最近南京部队代表队演出的“东进序曲”和兰州部队代表队演出的歌剧“红鹰”，相当激动人心。同时，会演中还继续出现了一些优秀的节目，颇受欢迎。
    “东进序曲”是根据新四军坚持苏北抗战的一段真实历史编写的。编剧是南京部队前线话剧团的创作干部顾宝璋（电影“南征北战”的作者之一）和所云平（话剧“水往高处流”，“在前进道路上”的作者）所写。这个剧的时代背景是1940年国民党在日寇诱降政策下，发动了反共高潮，苏北抗战局面出现了严重危机，我新四军为挽救苏北抗战危局，即派东进挺进支队渡江，在大桥粉碎了日寇的扫荡后，又解放了日寇盘据的桥头镇，解救了苦难中的人民，稳定了苏北的抗战局面，但正在此时，国民党顽固派和地方势力，在南京汪伪政府代表的秘密活动下达成协议，要乘日寇扫荡之际，聚歼我军。为了团结抗日，我军一再忍让，同时派了谈判代表“出使江州”“舌战群顽”。但顽固派反共心切，拒绝和谈，扣留了我方代表，对我新四军东进先遣支队驻在的桥头镇发动了进攻，打响了内战第一枪。我方军民经过浴血战斗打退了顽固派的进攻，并俘获了敌军一个纵队司令。这时，顽固派方面具有民族意识的另一纵队司令在我军晓以大义和地下党员的帮助下，宣布起义，使顽固派处境孤立，面临险境。此时，我军为了团结抗日又主动停止进攻，终于促使顽固派放弃了反共投降阴谋，同我一道抗日。
    这个戏通过错综复杂的矛盾冲突，深刻体现了党和毛主席抗日民族统一战线政策的伟大。全剧结构比较严谨，情节紧张，主题突出。通过导演石岩，演员徐林格，张宪等同志的创造，使主要人物个个栩栩如生，从始至终紧扣人心。特别是“出使江州”、“舌战群顽”几场戏，尤为精彩。
    兰州部队战斗文工团编写并演出的歌剧“红鹰”，也是这几天会演中出现的一个好戏。这个戏是描写红军长征时，某部卫生队的政治指导员林华同志因负伤和大队失掉联系，留在藏区引导藏胞进行斗争的事迹。
    剧一开始，便是在茫茫草地上，一群红军战士和林华受到国民党和马步芳匪军的追击，边战边退的情景。接着在紧张的战斗情况下，林华为掩护别人退却，负伤倒下了。从此，她开始了这样的遭遇：随时有被马匪逮捕杀害可能，也随时有被不了解红军的藏民所误杀的可能。她怎样生活下去呢？这是观众所十分关心的。接着，围绕着主人翁的遭遇和命运，藏民和千户、头人的矛盾，包括头人在内的整个部落和国民党马匪的矛盾一层层地展开了。剧本最可贵的地方，是在每幕戏的矛盾高潮，都给观众展现了这位共产党人处处为了藏民利益，不顾个人生死荣辱的伟大感情。虽然，因为千户一怒之下杀死了压榨藏民的马匪代表，以致马匪派兵要血洗白河草原，藏民奋起了，千户不得不接受了林华的建议，把部队撤往南山，但经过时间和斗争的考验，他终于忘恩负义，要杀害林华，投奔国民党。这时，林华已经在群众中生根了，群众也从实际斗争中认清了究竟跟谁走才是藏民的唯一解放的道路，他们选出了部落英雄和红军军医林华，领导大家继续斗争。
    这个歌剧的好处首先是刻划人物成功，并且较好地体现了党的民族政策，其次是很适合于歌剧表现。再则是全剧中心突出，一切矛盾始终是围绕着主人翁的命运的。加上音乐和演员的创造，比较好地完成了剧本所提供的任务。（附图片）
