Xinhua News Agency, July 13th: The Chinese National Men's Basketball Team, after a hard-fought battle tonight, defeated the strong European basketball team, the Hungarian National Men's Basketball Team, by a narrow margin of three points, with a score of 73 to 70. In the first half, the Chinese team led 36 to 30.

This is the first time the Chinese National Men's Basketball Team has defeated the experienced Hungarian National Men's Basketball Team since the two teams first met in 1949.

This rare and exciting international basketball game was very tense. Although the Chinese team led in scoring for most of the game and was only tied four times (24-24, 26-26, 55-55, 57-57), the outcome was still very uncertain until the last three minutes. Until the very end, the Chinese team actively organized their offense after gaining possession of the ball, and the game ended with a score of 73 to 70. At this point, the Mayor of Beijing, Peng Zhen, went to the court to meet the athletes from both sides and took pictures with them. More than 6,000 spectators also applauded enthusiastically, thanking the players from both sides for their excellent performance.

The Hungarian National Men's Basketball Team will hold a total of four friendly matches in Beijing. The other three matches are: July 14th against the Beijing team; July 16th against the "August 1st" team; July 18th against the Chinese National Team.

    中匈首次篮球赛在京举行
    我队经过艰苦奋战获得胜利
    新华社13日讯　中国国家男子篮球队今晚经过艰苦奋战，以七十三比七十仅三分的优势，赢了欧洲篮球劲旅——匈牙利国家男子篮球队。上半场中国队以三十六比三十领先。
    这是中、匈男子篮球队自1949年开始交锋以来，中国国家男子篮球队第一次战胜了有经验的匈牙利国家男子篮球队。
    这场少见的精采的国际篮球比赛，打得十分紧张，尽管中国队在比赛过程中绝大部分时间得分都领先，而且只被对方追成过四次平局（二十四平、二十六平、五十五平、五十七平），但到最后三分钟时，胜负属谁还很难预料。直到最后，中国队得球仍然积极组织进攻，比赛遂以七十三比七十的比分结束。这时候，北京市市长彭真走到球场中接见了双方的运动员们，并同他们一起照了像。六千多名观众也热烈鼓掌，感谢双方队员的出色表演。
    匈牙利国家男子篮球队共将在北京举行四场友谊比赛，其他三场是：14日对北京队；16日对“八一”队；18日对中国国家队。
