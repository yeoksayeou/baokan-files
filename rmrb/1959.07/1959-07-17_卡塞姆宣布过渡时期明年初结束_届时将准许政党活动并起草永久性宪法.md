Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, 14th - Iraqi Prime Minister Kassem announced tonight that the transitional period will end on Army Day, January 6, 1960. He said that on that day "we will celebrate the permission for all political parties to conduct activities."

Kassem said that he chose this day "to express the unity between the military and the people." He also said, "After that day, we will draft a permanent constitution, which must conform to the interests of the people and the motherland. It will not be approved unless the people can express their opinions on this constitution through a referendum." He said that Iraq will hold free elections to elect a National Assembly.

Kassem revealed in a speech to students at the Iraqi Military Academy that Iraq is negotiating with foreign oil companies to determine the government's policy on oil issues. He said, "Since the revolution, we have decided our oil policy according to the principle of increasing production and income to make up for government expenditures." He said, "Our policy is a policy of peace. But this policy will never depart from the position of ensuring the interests of the people and the motherland." He said, "We will abide by agreements, regulations and contracts within the scope of the interests of the motherland."

Kassem also announced that the government has allocated 150 million dinars to build model villages for farmers.

He called on workers and farmers to increase production.

Speaking on the issue of democratic freedom, Kassem said that he agreed with the view that the enemies of the people should not be allowed freedom. He believes, "However, my interpretation is different from some of you. Because the only ones qualified to determine the enemies of the people are the laws. The laws point out who are the enemies of the people and who are loyal to the people."

Internationally, the Prime Minister said, "Our friendship with the communists in socialist countries and other countries in the world is based on mutual benefit." He said, "We will increasingly enhance this friendship."

    卡塞姆宣布过渡时期明年初结束
    届时将准许政党活动并起草永久性宪法
    新华社巴格达14日电　伊拉克总理卡塞姆今天晚上宣布，过渡时期将在1960年1月6日陆军节那天结束。他说，在那一天“我们将庆祝准许各政党进行活动”。
    卡塞姆说，他挑选这一天“来表示军民之间的团结”。他还说，“在那天以后，我们将起草一部永久性的宪法，这部宪法必须符合人民和祖国的利益。除非在人民能够通过公民投票来表示他们对这部宪法的意见后，它是不会得到批准的。”他说，伊拉克将举行自由选举以选出一个国民议会。
    卡塞姆在对伊拉克军事学院学生发表讲话时透露，伊拉克正在同外国石油公司谈判，以便确定政府对石油问题的政策。他说，“自从革命以来，我们已经按照增加生产和收入以弥补政府开支的原则决定我们的石油政策。”他说：“我们的政策是和平的政策。但是这个政策决不离开确保人民和祖国利益的立场。”他说，“我们将在祖国利益的范围内遵守协议、规章和合同。”
    卡塞姆还宣布，政府已经拨出一亿五千万第纳尔来为农民建造模范村庄。
    他要求工人和农民增加生产。
    卡塞姆在谈到民主自由的问题时说，他同意这个意见：即不准人民的敌人有自由。他认为，“但是，我同你们之间有些人的解释不一样。因为唯一有资格确定人民的敌人的是法律，法律指出谁是人民的敌人，谁是忠于人民的人。”
    在国际方面，总理说，“我们同社会主义国家的共产党人以及世界上其他国家的友谊，是建立在互利的基础上的。”他说，“我们将愈来愈增进这种友谊。”
