    The Secretariat of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council issued a call on July 4th to the Asian-African Solidarity Committees of various countries and all peace-loving people in the world to hold a "Vietnam Day" on July 20th to fight for the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. This call has been widely echoed.
    The heroic Vietnamese people have been fighting for independence and freedom since the French armed invasion of Vietnam in 1885. After Japan invaded Indochina in 1940, the Vietnamese Communist Party organized the "Vietnam Independence League" (referred to as "Viet Minh") to lead the Vietnamese people in the War of Resistance Against Japan. It was not until August 1945 that the Vietnamese people held a general uprising and declared the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. However, the French colonialists, with the help of the British army that accepted the surrender of the Japanese army at the time, re-invaded Vietnam in September 1945. In order to defend national independence and freedom, the Vietnamese people had to launch a full-scale war of resistance against France in 1946. Thanks to the Vietnamese people becoming stronger and stronger in the eight years of the just war, especially winning a major victory in the Dien Bien Phu campaign, and thanks to the joint efforts of the Soviet Union, China, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Geneva Conference finally reached an agreement in July 1954 on the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam.
    The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has always strictly abided by the Geneva Accords and has repeatedly made suggestions to the South Vietnamese authorities, requesting both parties to hold consultations to discuss holding free general elections throughout the country to achieve the reunification of Vietnam. It also sent two open letters to the South Vietnamese authorities in March and December 1958, putting forward many suggestions that were conducive to easing the situation and creating conditions for both parties to approach and understand each other, hoping to further achieve the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. In contrast, the South Vietnamese authorities have been following the U.S. imperialists in seriously undermining the Geneva Accords and have stubbornly rejected the valuable suggestions of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to hold consultations to achieve the reunification of the motherland. At the same time, they have suppressed the South Vietnamese people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland by launching the so-called "Accuse the Communists, Eliminate the Communists" campaign and "sweeping," arresting, torturing, imprisoning, and massacring patriotic people.
    In recent years, the United States' interference in South Vietnam and its actions of deliberately undermining the Geneva Accords have become increasingly blatant. The United States has been continuously transporting war materials to South Vietnam, dispatching military personnel, and establishing military bases in South Vietnam. Recently, the United States has further attempted to transport atomic weapons and rocket weapons into South Vietnam. The United States, through its military bases in South Vietnam and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, is plotting to expand its aggressive conspiracy activities, seriously threatening the peace of Indochina.
    Regardless of the U.S. imperialists and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's various suppressions and persecutions, the South Vietnamese people have continuously launched various struggles to strive for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. The flames of the South Vietnamese people's struggle against the U.S.-Ngo clique have spread throughout the country. The people of North Vietnam are even more actively demanding the peaceful reunification of their motherland. They are supporting the struggle of their southern compatriots with large-scale parades and demonstrations, and with production achievements on various fronts of socialist construction, in order to promote the peaceful reunification of the motherland. The just demands of the Vietnamese people have won the enthusiastic support of peace-loving people all over the world. The Chinese government and people have always been concerned about the peaceful reunification of Vietnam and the strict implementation of the Geneva Accords, and believe that with the efforts of the entire Vietnamese people and the support of peace-loving people all over the world, the peaceful reunification of Vietnam will surely be realized.

    “越南日”
    亚非人民团结理事会书记处于7月4日号召各国的亚非团结委员会以及世界上一切爱好和平的人民在7月20日举行“越南日”，为实现越南的和平统一而斗争。这个号召得到了广泛的响应。
    英勇的越南人民自从1885年法国武装侵略越南以来，就开始了争取独立自由的斗争。1940年日本侵入印度支那后，越南共产党组织了
  “越南独立同盟”（简称“越盟”）领导越南人民进行抗日战争。直到1945年8月，越南人民举行总起义，宣布成立越南民主共和国。但是，法国殖民者在当时接受日军投降的英军的帮助下，在1945年9月重新侵入越南，越南人民为了保卫民族独立与自由，不得不在1946年掀起全面的抗法战争。由于越南人民在八年的正义战争中越战越强，特别在奠边府战役中取得了重大胜利，由于苏联、中国和越南民主共和国的共同努力，终于在1954年7月促使日内瓦会议达成了在越南停止敌对行动的协定。
    越南民主共和国政府一贯严格遵守日内瓦协议，曾经多次向南越当局提出建议，要求双方举行协商，以便讨论在全国范围内举行自由普选，实现越南的统一。并曾在1958年3月、12月先后向南越当局发出两次公开信，提出了有利于缓和局势，并为双方接近和相互了解创造条件的许多建议，希望能够进而实现越南的和平统一。与此相反，南越当局却一直追随美帝国主义严重地破坏日内瓦协议，并一味拒绝越南民主共和国要求举行协商以实现祖国统一的宝贵建议。同时以所谓“诉共、灭共”战役和对爱国人民的“扫荡”、逮捕、拷打、监禁和屠杀，来镇压南越人民要求和平统一祖国的斗争。
    几年来，美国对南越的干涉和蓄意破坏日内瓦协议的行动日益露骨。美国不断向南越输送战争物资，派遣军事人员，在南越建立军事基地。最近，美国更进一步企图把原子武器和火箭武器运进南越。美国通过它在南越的军事基地和东南亚条约组织，策划扩大侵略的阴谋活动，严重地威胁着印度支那的和平。
    不顾美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团的百般镇压迫害，南越人民为争取祖国和平统一不断掀起各种各样的斗争。南越人民反对美吴集团的斗争火焰燃遍各地。越南北部的人民更是积极要求祖国的和平统一。他们以声势浩大的游行示威，以社会主义建设各个战线上的生产成就，来支援南部同胞的斗争，以期促进祖国的和平统一。越南人民的正义要求已获得世界爱好和平人民的热烈支持。中国政府和人民一直关心越南的和平统一，关心日内瓦协议的严格贯彻，并且相信在越南全国人民的努力和全世界爱好和平人民支持下，越南的和平统一一定会实现的。　（雪）
