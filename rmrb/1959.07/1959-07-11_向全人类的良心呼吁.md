An Appeal to the Conscience of All Humanity
Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Member of the Presidium of the World Peace Council, Recipient of the Lenin Prize "For Strengthening International Peace"

The actions of the Greek authorities in persecuting the Greek national hero Manolis Glezos and other Greek patriots have aroused the anger of the Greek people and the people of the world. Now, Glezos and other patriots have been handed over to the Athens Military Tribunal for secret trial. The Greek reactionaries are obviously playing a despicable and shameful political conspiracy, attempting to murder Glezos and other Greek patriots. All honest people around the world are deeply concerned about the fate of Glezos and other patriots.

The glorious name of Glezos belongs not only to the Greek people but also to the people of the world. On May 31, 1941, the young Glezos risked his life to climb the ancient castle of Athens to tear down the Nazi swastika flag and re-hoist the Greek flag. This heroic deed inspired the Greek people with encouragement, confidence, and courage; it also inspired the people of the world with encouragement, confidence, and courage in the arduous struggle against fascism. The name of Glezos encouraged the resistance fighters of France, the guerrillas of Albania, and every anti-fascist conscience in the world. At that time, we Chinese people were in the cruel years of resisting the Japanese fascist bandits. The Greek patriots represented by Glezos stood on the same front as the Chinese people and heroically attacked the world's fascist bandits. Therefore, when the news came that the Greek authorities were attempting to persecute the great anti-fascist fighter Glezos, all Chinese people could not help but be filled with indignation and had to express the most serious protest to the Greek authorities!

The charges imposed on Glezos by the Greek authorities are complete fabrications. Glezos's life is as bright as the moon. For the national independence and democratic freedom of Greece, he risked his life and spared no effort. The fascists and the Greek reactionaries had imprisoned him in gloomy prisons more than ten times and sentenced him to death three times, but Glezos stood tall with the support of the Greek people, like the peaks of Olympus. The Greek people loved this national hero. Even during his imprisonment, the Greek people elected him as a member of parliament twice. The United Democratic Left Party of Greece, to which Glezos belongs, won the support of the Greek people in the general election in May 1958. The Athens "Dawn Daily," which Glezos hosted, shouted out the voice of the Greek people demanding peace, democracy, and freedom. What crime did Glezos commit? Is it a crime to fight for the restoration of Greece's honor and to fight for the immortal cause of peace and democratic freedom? What is even more infuriating is that the prosecutor of the Greek reactionary court once listed Glezos's heroic act of tearing down the Nazi flag eighteen years ago as a crime in a trial, and falsely accused it as a "despicable and shameful crime." This cannot but be an insult to the Greek people, an insult to the Greek flag on the Athens castle, and an insult to the human conscience. In fact, the Greek authorities are using the fascist laws of the former reactionary dictator Metaxas era to persecute the Greek patriot Glezos on the charge of so-called "espionage," which is a truly despicable and shameful act.

People all over the world have noticed that the Greek authorities are actively preparing to accept the plan of American imperialism to establish missile bases on Greek territory. This means that the peace of Greece and the peace of the Balkans will encounter extremely serious threats. This sinful attempt by the Greek authorities to follow the American war forces and violate the people's desire for peace has been strongly opposed by the Greek people. Precisely because of this, the Greek reactionaries have intensified the persecution of Glezos and other Greek patriots who represent the Greek democratic forces, in order to turn Greece into an outpost for the United States to undermine Balkan peace and a base for launching aggressive wars.

However, as Manolis Glezos said in his letter to the Greek Prime Minister, no violence can suppress the Greek people's ardent ideals for a better future; the people and history will act as just judges. We solemnly warn the Greek authorities that they must immediately release Glezos and other Greek patriots and must not persecute Glezos and all Greek patriots! We want to issue an urgent appeal to the conscience of all humanity: Rescue Glezos, the fighter for peace and democracy in Greece, and other patriots!

    向全人类的良心呼吁
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席  世界和平理事会主席团委员“加强国际和平”列宁奖金获得者  郭沫若
    希腊当局迫害希腊民族英雄曼诺里斯·格列索斯和其他希腊爱国者的行为激起了希腊人民和全世界人民的愤怒。现在，格列索斯和其他爱国人士已被交付雅典军事法庭秘密审判，希腊反动派显然是在玩弄一个卑劣可耻的政治阴谋，企图杀害格列索斯和希腊其他爱国人士。全世界一切正直的人们都在深切地关心着格列索斯和其他爱国人士的命运。
    格列索斯的光辉的名字，不仅属于希腊人民，而且也属于全世界人民。1941年5月31日，青年的格列索斯冒着生命危险爬上雅典古城堡去扯下纳粹的卐旗帜，而重新插上希腊国旗的英勇事迹，使希腊人民得到鼓舞、信心和勇气；同时也使全世界人民在反法西斯的严酷的斗争中得到鼓舞、信心和勇气。格列索斯的名字鼓舞了法兰西的抵抗战士、阿尔巴尼亚的游击队员和世界上每一颗反法西斯的良心。我们中国人民当时正处在反抗日本法西斯强盗的残酷的年代，以格列索斯为代表的希腊爱国者正是同中国人民站在一条战线上英勇地打击了世界法西斯匪徒。因此，当希腊当局企图迫害伟大的反法西斯战士格列索斯的消息传来，全中国人民不能不义愤填膺，不能不对希腊当局表示最严重的抗议！
    希腊当局强加于格列索斯的罪名是彻头彻尾的捏造。格列索斯的生平皎洁如同明月。他为了希腊的民族独立和民主自由，出生入死，奋不顾身；法西斯和希腊的反动派曾十余次把他关进阴森的牢狱，三次判处他死刑，但是格列索斯在希腊人民的支持下凛然屹立，有如奥林匹斯的山峰。希腊人民爱戴这位民族英雄，甚至在他被囚的日子里，希腊人民曾两次把他选为国会议员。格列索斯所属的希腊统一民主左翼党在1958年5月大选中得到了希腊人民的拥护。格列索斯所主办的雅典“黎明日报”，为希腊人民喊出要求和平、民主与自由的声音。格列索斯犯了什么罪？难道为了恢复希腊的荣誉而奋斗，为了和平与民主自由的不朽事业而斗争，就有罪了吗？更令人愤慨的是，希腊反动法庭的检察官曾经在一次审讯中把格列索斯在十八年前扯下纳粹旗帜的英雄行为也列为罪状，并诬蔑为“卑鄙可耻的罪行”。这不能不是对希腊人民的侮辱，对雅典城堡上那面希腊国旗的侮辱，对人类良心的侮辱。其实，希腊当局袭用前反动独裁者梅塔克萨斯时代的法西斯法律，以所谓“间谍活动”罪迫害希腊爱国者格列索斯，这才是真正卑鄙可耻的行为。
    全世界人民都已经注意到，希腊当局正在积极准备接受美国帝国主义在希腊的国土上建立导弹基地的计划。这就意味着希腊的和平、巴尔干的和平将遇到极其严重的威胁。希腊当局的这种追随美国战争势力，违反人民和平意愿的罪恶企图，遭到了希腊人民的强烈反对。正是因为这样，希腊反动派加紧了对格列索斯和其他希腊爱国者所代表的和希腊民主力量的迫害，以便使希腊变成美国破坏巴尔干和平的前哨基地和发动侵略战争的基地。
    但是，正如曼诺里斯·格列索斯在写给希腊首相的信中所说的，任何暴力都镇压不了希腊人民争取美好未来的热烈的理想；人民和历史将要作为正义的法官。我们正告希腊当局，必须立即释放格列索斯和其他希腊爱国者，不许迫害格列索斯和希腊一切爱国者！我们要向全人类的良心发出紧急的呼吁：援救希腊和平与民主的斗士格列索斯和其他爱国者！
