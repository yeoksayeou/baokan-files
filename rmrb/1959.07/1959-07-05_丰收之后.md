From sowing to reaping, every grain of rice is earned with sweat. After the harvest, the important thing is to manage and use the grain well.

If managed well, the grain that is brought into the granary will have practical value. If not managed well, the numbers in storage will be discounted, which will affect distribution. The issue of grain use is even more important and should not be neglected. If used properly, there will be more than enough throughout the year.

Qujing and Baoshan are paying attention to grain storage, and Chongqing's government offices and residents are paying attention to grain conservation. These are two good things, and they are the most important things to do after the harvest.

    丰收之后
    从耕种到收割，粒粒粮食皆辛苦。丰收之后要注意的就是把粮食管好和用好。
    管得好，丰收入库的粮食才有实用的价值，管得不好，库存的数字就要打折扣，就会影响到分配。用粮问题更不可疏忽，用之得当，一年到头才会绰绰有余。
    曲靖、保山注意粮食保管，重庆机关和居民注意粮食节约，这是两件好事，是丰收之后头等重要的事。
