Summer in Qinghai Lake is sunny and warm, with a gentle sea breeze. Along the mouth of the Buha River, tents are scattered across the green meadows, and fishing boats come and go in the river in twos and threes. The calm and vast grassland appears very lively, like a market.

	This Year, There are Many Qinghai Naked Carp
	This year, there are particularly many fish in the river, perhaps because of the warm weather. After noon every day, schools of fish swim upstream from the lake, the Qinghai naked carp in the river writhing and in a chaotic mass, constantly jumping out of the water.
	In the past, some people said, "A horse walking in the river can trample several fish to death," and I always felt that this was an exaggeration. Now, I fully believe this statement. In the Buha River, as long as you are in a shallow area and scoop with a sieve in the water, you can catch four or five fresh fish. "Qinghai Lake is a Fish Treasury"
	How many fish are hidden in Qinghai Lake? This is a question that readers are very concerned about. According to a comrade from the Aquatic Products Bureau, the catch per mu is estimated to be 72 kilograms based on actual fishing. The total area of ​​Qinghai Lake is 6.3 million mu, and the total reserves are 453.36 million kilograms. What an amazing number! No wonder a person in charge of the state-owned Qinghai Lake Fishery said: "Qinghai Lake is our 'fish treasury'."
	One evening, I strolled to the river and saw the Huangzhong Commercial Bureau fishing team casting their nets there, pulling in a net every twenty minutes or so, each net yielding about 3,000 kilograms. I heard that when the fish schools are large, each net can catch up to 15,000 kilograms, which cannot be transported by three large trucks.
		Two Hundred and Fifty Times
	On the beach grassland, I saw piles of dried fish fillets, stacked like "small islands." In the shallow waters of the river, large quantities of fresh Qinghai naked carp are stored, all blocked by nets, waiting for large trucks to transport them.
	According to a comrade from the Aquatic Products Bureau, this year the province's stipulated fishing task is 5,000 tons. Compared with the highest annual output of 20 tons (40,000 jin) before liberation, this figure has increased by 250 times. According to statistics from the Aquatic Products Bureau, from the beginning of fishing this year to the end of June, 1,500 tons of Qinghai naked carp (including dried fish fillets) have been transferred out. With the strengthening of transportation capacity, the number of transfers will gradually increase in the future.
	Tibetan Fishing Team
	There are 59 Tibetan team members in the Gonghe County fishing team, all of whom come from the Tiebujia Commune.
	Fishing is an unfamiliar occupation for the Tibetan people. Historically, the Tibetan people have rarely engaged in fishery production. In the past, reactionary lamas and headmen often used superstitious reasoning to deceive the Tibetan masses, saying that "eating fish from the water is a great sin," "there are gods in the water, eating it will cause disasters and diseases, and you will suffer after death"... Now, no one believes these ghost stories anymore. Fishing, like hunting, is a sideline production, and eating fish is no different from slaughtering cattle and sheep. If the Han people can eat it, why can't the Tibetans? They clearly realize that fishing brings in a lot of income and is very beneficial to developing production and improving the lives of commune members. A Tibetan cadre said to me: Fishing is a good sideline, and you are not idle all year round. With more income, the commune will develop well.

### 夏日青海湟鱼肥——青海湖鱼场散记

    夏日青海湟鱼肥
    ——青海湖鱼场散记
  　赵玮
    夏季，青海湖畔天气晴暖，海风习习。沿布哈河口一带，一座一座的帐篷，散布在绿茵上面，捕鱼船三三两两，在河中来往。平静而广阔的草原，显得十分热闹，有如集市。
      今年湟鱼多
    今年，河里的鱼特别多，或许是天暖的原因。每天晌午一过，成群的鱼从湖中逆流而上，河里的湟鱼万头钻动，乱作一团，时时跳出水面。
    过去有人说，“马行河中，能踏死几条鱼”，我总觉得有些夸大其辞。现在，我完全相信这句话。在布哈河里，只要你在浅水处，用一面筛子向水中一扣，准可以捉到四、五条鲜鱼。“青海湖是鱼库”
    青海湖里到底蕴藏着多少鱼？这是读者十分关心的问题。据水产局的一位同志谈，每市亩的捕获量，根据实际捕鱼作出的估计是七十二公斤。青海湖的总面积是六百三十万市亩，总蕴藏量是四亿五千三百六十万公斤。这是一个多么惊人的数字呵！怪不得国营青海湖鱼场的一位负责同志说：“青海湖是我们的‘鱼库’”。
    一天傍晚，我信步走到河边，看见湟中商业局捕鱼队正在那里撒网，大约二十几分钟就拉一网，每一网总有三千斤左右。听说鱼群大时，每网最多可捕一万五千斤，用三个大卡车都运不完。
            二百五十倍
    在河滩草坪上，我看到一垛垛晒好了的干片鱼，堆得像“小岛”。在河中浅水处，储存着大批的鲜湟鱼，都是用网拦住，等待大卡车来运。
    据水产局的一位同志谈，今年省里规定的捕鱼任务是五千吨。这个数字，和解放前最高年产量二十吨（四万斤）相比，提高了二百五十倍。据水产局的统计，从今年开始捕鱼到6月底止，已调运出湟鱼（包括干片鱼）一千五百吨。随着运输力量的加强，今后调运数字将会逐步增加。
    藏民捕鱼队
    共和县捕鱼队里有五十九名藏族队员，他们都是从铁卜加公社来的。
    捕鱼，对藏族人民说来，是一个生疏的职业。从历史上看，藏族人民很少从事渔业生产。过去，反动的喇嘛、头人，常常用迷信道理欺骗藏族群众，说“吃水里的鱼罪孽大”、“水里有神灵，吃了生灾生病，死后还要受罪”……现在，没有人相信这些鬼话了。捕鱼和打猎一样，都是副业生产，吃鱼和宰食牛羊没有什么区别，汉族能吃，藏族为什么就不能吃？他们清楚地认识到：捕鱼收入大，对发展生产、提高社员生活有很大的好处。一个藏族干部对我说：捕鱼是一项好副业，一年四季都不闲着。收入多了，社就好发展。
