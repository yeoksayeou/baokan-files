This newspaper Wuhan, July 30th dispatch: Hubei farmers, amidst the tense drought resistance and "double搶 [qiǎng]" (搶收早稻，搶插晚稻, seizing the early rice harvest and rushing to plant late rice), are making every effort to strengthen the field management of mid-season rice and single-season late rice, striving for a bumper autumn harvest.

This year, Hubei Province has planted over 20 million mu of mid-season rice and single-season late rice, accounting for about two-thirds of the province's total rice area. In particular, mid-season rice has a large area and high yield, accounting for a large proportion of the province's total grain output over the years. Currently, it is the period of heading and grain filling for mid-season rice and tillering development for single-season late rice. However, the province has been hit by drought at this time, and coupled with the fact that various places have to rush to harvest early rice and rush to transplant late rice, the labor force is even more insufficient. In order to strive for a bumper harvest of mid-season rice and single-season late rice, despite the situation of many tasks, tight time, and a small labor force, various places have still made arrangements for the field management of mid-season rice and single-season late rice. Many areas, on the basis of a comprehensive organization of the labor force, have adopted the method of tackling drought, "double 搶", and field management simultaneously. In order to completely eliminate the third-class seedlings of mid-season rice and single-season late rice, Xianning County recently established more than 700 advisory groups combining experienced farmers, technicians, and cadres, going deep into the fields for consultation, identifying characteristics, and prescribing the right medicine for the specific field and seedling, with excellent results.

In order to overcome drought and ensure a bumper harvest, Hubei has been closely grasping drought resistance and seedling protection since the drought first appeared. Regardless of the heat, people are blocking rivers to build dams, digging wells and springs, and using waterwheels to irrigate fields to ensure that mid-season rice and single-season late rice have sufficient water. To date, Xiaogan, Huanggang, and Xiangyang prefectures alone have irrigated 3.5 million mu of drought-stricken mid-season rice and single-season late rice once or twice, with the irrigated area reaching more than 80% of the drought-stricken rice area in these prefectures. Gong'an County originally had more than 400,000 mu of rice affected by drought, some of which had begun to wither seriously. After a period of recent efforts, more than 300,000 mu of fields in the county have been filled with water, and the yellowing and withering mid-season rice and single-season late rice have now turned green again.

While fighting the drought, various places are also paying close attention to the prevention and control of rice pests and diseases. Some counties in Xiaogan, Jingzhou, and other prefectures have generally carried out pest control two to three times for mid-season rice and single-season late rice. Various places have also organized special forces to carry out a fertilizer accumulation campaign to solve the difficulty of insufficient topdressing. Jingzhou Prefecture has recently established more than 390,000 field manure storage areas, and Huanggang, Yidu, and other regions have accumulated tens of millions of dan of miscellaneous fertilizer in a week. Many areas have not only basically met the topdressing needs of mid-season rice and single-season late rice, but also prepared some base fertilizer for late autumn and winter crops.

Due to the above efforts, the third-class seedlings of mid-season rice and single-season late rice in Hubei, which were originally caused by drought or lack of fertilizer, have now mostly improved. Taking Huanggang Prefecture as an example, this prefecture originally had more than 370,000 mu of third-class mid-season rice seedlings. After waterwheel drought resistance and rush topdressing, most of them have now been converted into first-class and second-class seedlings.

    安排劳力　加强管理　抗旱除虫　积肥追肥
    湖北促进中稻灌浆晚稻分蘖
    本报武汉30日电　湖北各地农民在紧张的抗旱和“双抢”的情况下，千方百计地加强中稻和一季晚稻的田间管理，力争秋季丰收。
    今年湖北省种植的中稻和一季晚稻总共二千多万亩，占全省水稻面积的三分之二左右。特别是中稻面积大、产量高，历年来在全省粮食产量中占很大比重。目前，正是中稻扬花灌浆和一季晚稻分蘖发育的时期。可是，这时全省遭到了干旱，加上各地又要抢收早稻抢插晚稻，因而劳动力更加显得不足。为了争取中稻和一季晚稻的丰收，各地虽处在活路多、时间紧、劳力少的情况下，仍然对中稻和一季晚稻的田间管理作了安排。许多地区在全面组织劳动力的基础上，采取了边抗旱、边双抢、边田间管理的三管齐下的方法。咸宁县为了彻底消灭中稻和一季晚稻三类苗，最近成立了七百多个由老农、技术人员和干部三结合的顾问小组，深入田间会诊，摸清特点，因田因苗对症下药，收效极好。
    为了战胜干旱确保丰收，湖北各地还在干旱露头的时候，便紧紧地抓住了抗旱保苗，不顾炎热地拦河筑坝，挖井掘泉，车水灌田，以保证中稻、一季晚稻有足够的用水。到目前止，仅孝感、黄冈、襄阳三个专区即有三百五十多万亩受旱的中稻、一季晚稻，已经灌上了一次到两次水，灌溉面积达到这几个专区水稻受旱面积的80％以上。公安县原有四十多万亩水稻受旱，其中严重的已经开始枯萎，经过最近一段时间的努力，全县已有三十多万亩田里灌满了水，开始黄枯的中稻、一季晚稻现又转呈葱绿。
    与抗旱同时，各地对防治水稻病虫害也十分注意。孝感、荆州等专区有些县对中稻、一季晚稻普遍防虫二次到三次。各地还组织了专门力量开展了积肥运动，以解决追肥不足的困难。荆州专区最近已建立田头粪垱三十九万多个，黄冈、宜都等地区一周内就积了杂肥几千万担。许多地区已不仅基本上满足了中稻、一季晚稻的追肥需要，还为晚秋和冬播作物准备了部分底肥。
    由于上述各种努力，湖北各地中稻、一季晚稻原来因旱或缺肥而造成的三类苗，现在大都有了好转。以黄冈专区为例，这个专区原有中稻三类苗三十七万多亩，经过车水抗旱，突击追肥，现在大部分都已转为一、二类苗。
