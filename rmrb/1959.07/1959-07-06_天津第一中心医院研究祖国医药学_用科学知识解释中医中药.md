Tianjin First Central Hospital Studies Traditional Chinese Medicine
Using Scientific Knowledge to Explain Traditional Chinese Medicine

(Our newspaper's dispatch) Reporter Yu Xigui reports: Western medicine doctors at Tianjin First Central Hospital are actively studying clinical experience and theories of traditional Chinese medicine. Based on this, and in close cooperation with traditional Chinese medicine doctors, they are using scientific knowledge to explain traditional Chinese medicine treatment methods. Currently, they have proposed more than sixty scientific research projects related to traditional Chinese medicine, and twelve of these have already achieved preliminary results.

This hospital is a large hospital with relatively complete equipment and a high level of medical care. It also has a traditional Chinese medicine department and traditional Chinese medicine wards. Starting at the end of last year, under the leadership of the Party organization and with the help of traditional Chinese medicine doctors, all the hospital's Western medicine doctors and nursing staff have launched a surge in studying the clinical experience and theories of traditional Chinese medicine. In the research, they have proposed more than sixty scientific research projects related to traditional Chinese medicine, and medical staff spend half a day each week on research.

For effective traditional Chinese medicine treatments, they generally observe the changes in patients' conditions clinically, analyze the effects of traditional Chinese medicine treatments, conduct animal or bacterial experiments to study the effects of traditional Chinese medicine in sterilization, anti-inflammation, etc., and use scientific knowledge to explain traditional Chinese medicine treatments. Since September last year, the surgery department has used the traditional Chinese medicine formula "Da Huang Mu Dan Pi Tang" (Rhubarb and Moutan Decoction) to treat more than 300 cases of appendicitis, with a cure rate of 85% to 90%. Western medicine doctors discovered that after patients took this traditional Chinese medicine, their body temperature decreased, white blood cell count decreased, pain disappeared, and bowel movements generally increased. Traditional Chinese and Western medicine doctors held a special meeting to analyze that this medicine may have an effect like antibiotics and streptomycin. Through animal experiments, it was found that when dogs' intestines were injected with "Da Huang Mu Dan Pi Tang," the number of intestinal peristalsis increased, proving that this medicine also has the effect of relieving intestinal obstruction, reducing inflammation, and increasing intestinal peristalsis. Therefore, experiments were conducted using a mixture of "Da Huang Mu Dan Pi Tang" to test its antibacterial effect. At the same time, Western medicines penicillin and streptomycin were used as controls. The experimental results showed that the traditional Chinese medicine mixture had an inhibitory effect on bacteria, and the inhibitory effect was higher than that of penicillin. Based on the results of the experiment, the surgery ward wrote a paper titled "Treatment of Appendicitis with Traditional Chinese Medicine." Wang Jingxuan, an attending physician in the internal medicine department, and others, when studying classic works of traditional Chinese medicine, realized that pulse diagnosis occupies an important position in the medical system of traditional Chinese medicine. However, there are inconsistencies in the explanations of some individual problems in pulse diagnosis, which affects the further development of pulse diagnosis. In order to conduct theoretical research on pulse conditions, they formed a special group with traditional Chinese medicine doctors. After Western medicine doctors used "pulse recorders" to depict the pulse conditions of 100 patients, and the veteran traditional Chinese medicine doctors Song Bufeng and Zheng Jinghou made identifications, they found 21 types of pulse expression patterns, further clarified the pulse characteristics of some diseases, and wrote a paper on the study of traditional Chinese pulse diagnosis.

    天津第一中心医院研究祖国医药学
    用科学知识解释中医中药
    本报讯　记者虞锡珪报道：天津市第一中心医院的西医积极学习中医临床经验和理论，并在这一基础上，和中医密切合作，用科学的知识解释中医治疗方法。目前，他们已提出了六十多项有关中医中药的科学研究项目，其中十二项已初步取得成效。
    这个医院是一所设备比较完善，医疗水平较高的大型医院，并设有中医科和中医病房。从去年年底开始，全院西医和护理人员在党组织的领导和中医的帮助下，掀起了学习中医临床经验和理论的热潮。在研究中，他们提出了六十多项有关中医中药的科学研究项目，医务人员每周以半天时间进行研究。
    对疗效显著的中医治疗办法，一般采取临床观察病人病情变化情况，分析中药治疗的作用，通过作动物或细菌试验，研究中药在杀菌、消炎等方面的作用，用科学知识解释中医治疗办法。外科从去年9月开始，用中药“大黄牡丹皮汤”治疗阑尾炎三百多例，治愈率达85％至90％。西医发现病人服用这种中药后，体温下降，白血球降低，疼痛消失，而且一般排便增加，中西医一起开了专题会议，分析这种药可能有抗生霉素和链霉素。通过动物实验，发现狗的肠子被注入“大黄牡丹皮汤”以后，肠的蠕动次数增加，证明了这种药还有解除肠梗阻的消炎和增加肠蠕动的作用，于是，用“大黄牡丹皮汤”混合液进行细菌抑制作用的实验，同时用西药青霉素和链霉素作对照，实验结果，中药混合液对细菌有抑制作用，而且抑制的效果高于青霉素。根据实验的结果，外科病房写了“中药治疗阑尾炎”的论文。内科主治医生王景宣等人学习中医经典著作时，认识到脉诊在祖国医学医疗体系中占着重要的地位，但是在脉学的一些个别问题上，说法不一致，影响脉学的进一步发展。他们为了对脉象进行理论研究，和中医组成了专题小组，经过西医用“脉搏计”描绘一百例病人的脉象和老中医宋步峰、郑静侯的鉴定，找出了二十一类脉搏表现规律，进一步明确了一些疾病的脉象特点，写了有关祖国脉学研究的论文。（附图片）
