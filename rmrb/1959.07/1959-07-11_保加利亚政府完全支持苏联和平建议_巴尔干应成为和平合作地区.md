Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, July 9th. The Bulgarian government today issued a statement expressing unconditional support for the Soviet government's statement of June 25 this year on the issue of guaranteeing peace and security in the Balkans and the Adriatic Sea region.

The statement said that the Soviet Union's statement, which stems from good intentions, is filled with the most friendly concern of a great peace-loving country for the peace and security of the people of the Balkan Peninsula and the Adriatic Sea region. The Soviet Union is ready to guarantee the security and independence of the countries in this region together with other major powers if these countries undertake obligations not to establish atomic and rocket bases on their territory. The Bulgarian government welcomes this.

The statement pointed out that the government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria has already proposed to some of its neighbors to discuss the issue of concluding bilateral and collective agreements on security and non-aggression. In order to turn the Balkans into a zone of peace and international cooperation, the Bulgarian government is actively promoting the realization of this goal. Regrettably, these efforts by peace-loving countries have not received the due attention from officials in Greece, Turkey, and Italy.

The statement concluded that the government of the People's Republic of Bulgaria hopes that the governments of Turkey, Greece, and Italy, as well as the relevant major powers, will study the proposals in the Soviet government's statement with great attention, support the Soviet peace proposals, and thus contribute to the cause of guaranteeing lasting peace.

    保加利亚政府完全支持苏联和平建议
    巴尔干应成为和平合作地区
    新华社索非亚9日电　保加利亚政府今天发表声明，表示无条件支持苏联政府在今年6月25日发表的关于保障巴尔干和亚得里亚海地区和平和安全问题的声明。
    声明中说，苏联的出自善良愿望的声明充满了一个伟大的爱好和平的国家对巴尔干半岛和亚得里亚海地区各国人民和平与安全的最友好的关怀。苏联准备同其他大国一起保证这个地区各国的安全和独立，如果这些国家承担义务：不在本国领土建立原子基地和火箭基地的话。保加利亚政府对此表示欢迎。
    声明指出，保加利亚人民共和国政府已经向自己的一些邻国建议，就缔结安全和互不侵犯的双边协定和集体协定的问题进行讨论。为了变巴尔干为和平与国际合作区，保加利亚政府正积极地促进这一目的的实现。遗憾的是，爱好和平国家的这些努力还没有得到希腊、土耳其和意大利官方人士的应有的注意。
    声明最后说，保加利亚人民共和国政府希望，土耳其、希腊和意大利政府以及有关的大国以极大的注意力来研究苏联政府声明中的建议，支持苏联的和平建议，从而对保障持久和平的事业做出贡献。
