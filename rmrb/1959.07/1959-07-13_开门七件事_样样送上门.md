　　Firewood, rice, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar and tea - all delivered to your door

　　The commercial departments of Shaoxing County, Zhejiang Province, have added one hundred and eight mobile supply carriers to organize the economic life of the urban people.

　　These carriers are distributed in all corners of the city, some of which specialize in supplying oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and dried seafood and other sundries, so people can buy what they need for "firewood, rice, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar and tea" at their doorstep. Five mobile carriers specialize in door-to-door clothes dyeing; and some carriers supply spicy oil tofu, tofu brains and other foods. Forty-seven youtiao (fried dough sticks), soy milk, and other snack supply points have been distributed to various streets with more residents, so people can eat soy milk and youtiao nearby in the early morning. The catering and tea food industries have also added twenty-six supply points. (Attached picture)
