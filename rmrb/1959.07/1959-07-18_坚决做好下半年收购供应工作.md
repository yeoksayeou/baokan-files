Xinhua News Agency, July 17th. The National Conference of Commercial Department and Bureau Chiefs, convened by the Ministry of Commerce from June 29th to July 14th, reviewed the work of the first half of the year and made specific arrangements for the tasks of the second half of the year.

The meeting believed that, based on the specific circumstances of the second half of the year, commercial departments across the country must do the following:

First, we must use our greatest strength to do a good job in the acquisition of agricultural products, native products, and "waste products." In August and September, economic crops such as cotton, hemp, and tobacco will be harvested successively, and native and special products will also enter the peak season for large-scale picking. The success or failure of the acquisition of these agricultural and sideline native and special products directly affects the production of light industrial products and market supply. Commercial departments in various regions must seize the opportunity and make preparations for the acquisition as early as possible. The main tasks are: strengthening agricultural product procurement agencies, especially establishing and improving grass-roots procurement stations, replenishing personnel, and repairing and increasing processing equipment; training grading, classification, and other technical personnel. In order to ensure the quality of agricultural products and accelerate the progress of acquisitions, this year, in the cotton procurement methods, we must absorb the effective experiences of the past, such as guiding people's communes to do a good job in "four separations" (separate picking, separate storage, separate drying, and separate sales) and "three searches" (search for fallen cotton, search for stiff petal cotton, search for eyelashes). We must organize communes and production teams to quickly pick, quickly dry, and quickly deliver and sell, and help communes organize professional transportation teams to solve the problem of short-distance transportation of agricultural products. Procurement departments must, on the premise of doing a good job in the four procedures of inspection, weighing, warehousing, and settlement, carry out rapid acquisition, rapid processing, and rapid transfer, so that each link is tightly linked to ensure that the acquisition work is done quickly and meticulously. Regarding the acquisition of native products, the meeting believed that the main focus should be on reasonably resolving issues such as the organization and arrangement of labor, labor remuneration, and short-distance transportation, while also extensively organizing technical exchanges and technical cooperation, and conscientiously implementing allocation plans.

Second, we must organize the production and supply of non-staple foods and daily-use industrial products. At present, Party committees at all levels are vigorously grasping the production of non-staple foods and daily-use industrial products. Commercial departments must closely rely on the leadership of Party committees at all levels and do a good job in various specific tasks related to production and supply. In terms of non-staple foods, we must immediately seize the time to coordinate with agricultural departments to arrange for autumn vegetable production, so that the planting plan is implemented, and do a good job in retaining and allocating seeds to ensure the supply of vegetables this winter and next spring. In terms of daily-use industrial products, on the one hand, we must coordinate with industrial departments to solve the problems of raw materials and materials to increase production, while also paying attention to improving quality and expanding varieties; while grasping the production of several major commodities necessary for people's daily life, we must pay attention to the production and acquisition of handicraft products and small commodities. On the other hand, we must strengthen the allocation of goods and do a good job in the rational distribution between regions. The meeting believed that, in order to support the acquisition of agricultural products and to meet the needs of the vast rural areas for industrial products after the autumn harvest, we must pay special attention to the supply of industrial products to rural areas in the second half of the year. The supply work in key industrial and mining areas should also be strengthened, and we should try every means to organize the supply of necessities that are directly related to production and workers' health and ensure the supply.

Third, do a good job in the supply of means of production. The busy season of autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting is approaching, and the supply of agricultural means of production is an important task in the second half of the year. For irrigation and drainage machinery, we must continue to seize the time to organize supporting work; local fertilizers and local pesticides mainly rely on local production and local supply, and we must pay attention to reducing costs and improving the effectiveness of use. For coal used for flue-cured tobacco, cotton ginning, silkworm cocoon baking, and agricultural irrigation and drainage machinery, the supply must be guaranteed. In order to increase the supply of means of production, various regions should make full use of local waste materials and local steel and local iron. In the distribution of means of production, we should organize the supply in a planned and focused manner according to the characteristics of seasonal needs in the second half of the year for different commodities.

The meeting discussed the issues of doing a good job in material exchanges, promoting the diversified economy of the commune, and enlivening the market. It required that areas that have not yet held material exchange meetings should seize the time to convene them, and those that have been held should constantly check the implementation of contracts and summarize experiences. Rural fair trade should also be gradually developed.

The meeting also discussed the issue of "advance transportation" of commercial materials, requiring that commodities that can be decentralized or transferred to other places in advance should strive to be transported in advance in the third quarter in order to strengthen market supply and avoid the phenomenon of excessive transportation volume in the fourth quarter.

The meeting also studied the issues of strengthening commercial organization and various systems, strengthening the management of commercial funds, and doing a good job in peak season warehouse storage and transportation.

The meeting believed that the task of commercial work in the second half of this year is very arduous. All commercial workers must continue to muster revolutionary drive, overcome difficulties in every possible way, and complete the arduous tasks in the second half of the year. The meeting called on commercial departments in various regions to combine the specific tasks of the second half of the year, further carry out the "six goods" (good at promoting production, good at implementing policies, good at completing plans, good at business management, good at service quality, good at marching towards redness and expertise) socialist labor competition, so that this mass movement becomes the driving force for promoting the continued great leap forward in commercial work.

    坚决做好下半年收购供应工作
    全国商业厅局长会议号召努力促进商业工作继续大跃进
    用最大力量做好农产品土产品和“废品”的收购；组织好副食品和日用工业品的生产和供应；做好生产资料的供应；开好物资交流会和逐步开展农村集市贸易，促进公社多种经济的发展。
    新华社17日讯　商业部在6月29日到7月14日召开了全国商业厅、局长会议，检查了上半年的工作，对下半年的任务作了具体安排。
    会议认为，根据下半年的具体情况，全国商业部门必须做好以下几件事：
    首先，要用最大力量做好农产品、土产品和“废品”的收购工作。8、9月份，棉花、麻类、烟叶等经济作物就要陆续收获，土特产品也将进入大量采摘的旺季。这些农副土特产品收购的好坏，直接影响到轻工业品的生产和市场供应，各地商业部门必须抓紧时机，及早做好收购前的准备。主要是：加强农产品采购机构，特别是建立和健全基层采购站，充实人员，维修和增加加工设备；训练验级、分级和其他技术人员。为了保证农产品的质量和加快收购进度，今年在棉花的采购方法上，要吸取过去行之有效的经验，如指导人民公社作好“四分”（分摘、分存、分晒、分售）“三找”（找落地棉、找僵瓣棉、找眼睫毛）等。要组织公社、生产队快摘、快晒、快交售，帮助公社组织专业运输队，解决农产品的短途运输问题。采购部门要在做好验级、过秤、入库、结算四道手续的前提下，快收购、快加工、快调运，这样一环扣一环，环环扣紧，保证收购工作做得又快又细致。关于土产品的收购，会议认为主要应当合理解决劳动力的组织与安排、劳动报酬、短途运输等问题，同时要广泛组织技术交流和技术协作；认真执行调拨计划。
    其次，要组织好副食品和日用工业品的生产和供应。目前，各级党委都在大力抓副食品和日用工业品的生产，商业部门必须紧紧依靠各级党委的领导，做好生产和供应中有关的各项具体工作。在副食品方面，目前要立即抓紧协同农业部门安排好秋菜生产，使播种计划落实，做好种籽的留用和调剂工作，以保证今冬明春蔬菜的供应。在日用工业品方面，一方面，要协同工业部门解决原料和材料问题，以增加产量，同时要注意提高质量，扩大品种；在抓紧人民日常生活所必须的若干种主要商品的生产的同时，要注意手工业产品和小商品的生产和收购。另一方面，要加强商品的调拨和做好地区间的合理分配。会议认为，为了支持农产品收购，并且适应秋收后广大农村对工业品的需要，下半年要特别重视农村工业品的供应。对于重点工矿区的供应工作也应该加强，对一些直接关系生产和工人健康的必需品，应当千方百计地组织货源，保证供应。
    第三，做好生产资料的供应。秋收、秋耕、秋种的繁忙季节就要到来，农业生产资料供应是下半年一项重要任务。对排灌机械，要继续抓紧组织配套工作；土化肥、土农药，主要靠就地生产、就地供应，并且要注意降低成本和提高使用效果。对于烤烟、轧花、烤茧和农业排灌机械用煤，必须保证供应。为了增加生产资料的货源，各地应该充分利用当地的废旧材料和土钢土铁。在生产资料的分配上，应该分别不同的商品，根据下半年季节需要的特点，有计划有重点地组织供应。
    会议讨论了搞好物资交流，促进公社多种经济的发展，活跃市场等问题。要求各地没有开物资交流会的要抓紧召开，开过的要不断检查合同执行的情况和总结经验。农村集市贸易也要逐步开展起来。
    会议还讨论了商业物资要“提前运输”的问题，要求凡是有条件提前下放或外调的商品，力争在三季度提前运输，以便加强市场供应，避免出现第四季度运输量过大的现象。
    对于加强商业组织机构和各项制度，加强商业资金的管理，做好旺季仓库储存和运输等问题，会议也都作了研究。
    会议认为，今年下半年商业工作的任务十分繁重，全体商业职工必须继续鼓足革命干劲，千方百计克服困难，完成下半年的艰巨任务。会议要求各地商业部门，结合下半年的具体任务，把“六好”（促进生产好、执行政策好、完成计划好、经营管理好、服务质量好、向红专进军好）社会主义劳动竞赛进一步开展起来，使这一群众运动成为促进商业工作继续大跃进的动力。
