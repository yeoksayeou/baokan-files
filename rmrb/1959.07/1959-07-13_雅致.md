    Elegance
  　Qin Li
    Watching the Experimental Theatre's "The Thunderstorm," one immediately feels the beauty of the set design. The distant Volga River, the winding riverbank, the ancient Russian buildings on the shore, the spires of the churches...giving a sense of reality, and also a sense of subtle, harmonious beauty in color. This style is consistent throughout the subsequent set designs. The living room scene, the colors and shapes of the walls, the paintings on the walls, the doors, the chairs, etc., are all balanced and harmonious. The stage art of this play can be described with one adjective - elegant.
    To make the stage picture beautiful, to give a sense of beauty, it is not necessary to "desperately" smear and drape, like in some plays, with silks and satins, gold and silver jewelry, delicacies, dazzling the eyes, yelling and shouting, as if afraid the materials have not been exhausted, afraid the colors are not dazzling enough, afraid there are still gaps on the stage, afraid that all this has not achieved the purpose of "noisy" scenery "stealing" the show!
    Doing so is not in line with the purpose of improving stage art. This is the stage art trying to assert its independence. Moreover, such art is actually not beautiful.
    Of course, styles can be diverse, and "The Thunderstorm" is a famous Russian play, the scenery is Russian landscapes and architecture, we naturally cannot simply copy it, we have our own things, a national style. However, our excellent national artistic traditions are also beautiful, elegant, not ugly and disorganized.

    雅致
  　秦犁
    看实验话剧院的“大雷雨”，一开幕即感到布景的美。远远的伏尔加河，弯弯的河岸，岸上古老的俄罗斯建筑，教堂的尖顶……既给人以真实感，又给人以色彩素淡、调和的美感。这种风格贯穿在后面的各幕布景中。客厅一景，墙壁、壁上的画、门、椅子等等的颜色和外形，也都搭配得匀称谐和。这戏的舞台美术可以用这样一个形容词来形容它——雅致。
    要使舞台画面优美，给人以美感，不需要像个别戏中出现的那样“穷凶极恶”地涂抹披挂，绸缎绫罗，金银珠宝，山珍海味，目迷五色，大叫大嚷，唯恐材料还未使尽，唯恐颜色不够刺目，唯恐舞台上还留有空隙，唯恐这一切还没有达到“喧”景“夺”戏的目的！
    这样做，同提高舞台美术的宗旨并不相符。这是舞台美术的闹独立性。而且，这样的美术其实不美。
    当然，风格可以多种多样，而且“大雷雨”是俄国名剧，布景是俄国的风景和建筑，我们自不能照搬，我们有我们自己的东西，民族的风格。但是，我们的优秀的民族艺术传统同样也是优美的，雅致的，而不是丑陋的，杂乱无章的。
