    "Imperialism and the Chinese Customs" is a kind of data series of modern Chinese economic history, and the whole book is divided into more than ten volumes. The published ones are "The Chinese Customs and the Sino-French War," "The Chinese Customs and the Burmese-Tibetan Question," "The Chinese Customs and the Sino-Portuguese Lisbon Agreement," "The Chinese Customs and the Sino-Japanese War," and in print are "The Chinese Customs and the Anglo-German Continued Loan," "The Chinese Customs and the Boxer Rebellion Movement." The remaining volumes will be published in the coming years. The collation, editing, and publication of this data book will contribute to the in-depth study of modern Chinese history, especially the history of imperialist aggression against China.
    The old Chinese customs played a significant role in the process of imperialist aggression against China. For a long time after the 1850s and 1860s, the administrative power of the Chinese customs was always in the hands of imperialist elements, who used it to serve imperialist aggression against China. Among them, the Englishman Robert Hart, who held the position of Inspector General of Customs for almost half a century, was a well-known figure who used this institution to serve foreign countries, especially Britain. The vast majority of the four published volumes are telegrams and letters between Hart and James Duncan Campbell, the Customs Commissioner in the London office of the Chinese Customs, and a small part are reports from customs commissioners of various countries to Hart. In the past, when foreigners controlled the Chinese Customs, these materials were never shown to others. The reason is very simple: these documents are ironclad evidence of imperialist aggression against China and are records of their criminal activities personally written and engaged in at that time. After liberation, with the support of the Party and the government, the Research Office of the General Administration of Customs collated and translated this batch of important archives that had been kept confidential for many years into Chinese, and published them in separate volumes. It clearly tells people how foreign aggressors used the customs as a tool to interfere in and control China's internal affairs and diplomacy in the past, and helps people clearly understand the real situation of the customs controlled by imperialist elements and the activities of imperialist elements in the customs.
    The published volumes of "Imperialism and the Chinese Customs" have the following characteristics.
    First, it provides valuable data for scientific research and enriches people's historical knowledge of imperialist aggression against China. Since liberation, with the gradual development of teaching and research work on modern Chinese history, China has successively published the "Data Series of Modern Chinese History" and other data books, which facilitate the reference and use of historical workers. However, as far as the "Data Series of Modern Chinese History" is concerned, the vast majority are compilations of existing books, and the publication of unprinted manuscripts and original archives accounts for only a small part. The biggest feature of the published volumes of "Imperialism and the Chinese Customs" is that not only are all the materials translated from foreign languages for the first time, but also these important archival materials that have never been published are published in a fairly complete and fairly concentrated form for the first time for researchers to use. These confidential letters and telegrams between the parties concerned, with instructions on important plots, requests for instructions on difficult issues, reports on work progress, and reflections on the complex situations at that time and place, are valuable first-hand materials for understanding and studying the historical situation at that time. "The Chinese Customs and the Sino-French War" tells us that the Sino-French Tianjin Treaty of June 1885 was concluded under Hart's sole management. According to new materials, we have a comprehensive understanding of the entire process of this negotiation, and we can determine that the negotiation was actually conducted not in Tianjin, but in Paris. The actual negotiator on the Qing Dynasty side was Campbell, instructed by Hart, not Li Hongzhang. At that time, the role played by Li Hongzhang was far less than that of Hart. "The Chinese Customs and the Burmese-Tibetan Question" enables us to specifically know how Hart served Britain in these negotiations for treaties with Britain. The first three clauses of the Anglo-Burmese Treaty of 1886 were the same as the draft content he initially suggested to the British government, and the other two clauses were also related to Hart's activities. The two treaties on Tibet concluded between China and Britain in 1890 and 1893 were Hart's and Hart government's "masterpieces" of manipulating and deceiving Qing Dynasty officials. The conclusion of the Sino-Portuguese Lisbon Agreement, which sold out the sovereignty of the territory of Macau, was the result of Campbell's active activities under Hart's instructions, and Hart expanded his power as a result, seizing the management rights of the checkpoints set up by the Guangdong local government around Hong Kong and Macau. During the Sino-Japanese War, Hart did not have the opportunity to intervene in the Qing Dynasty's surrender to Japan, but the Anglo-German consortium obtained the right to the Qing government's second major loan after the war, which was inseparable from Hart's active activities. Hart's specific behind-the-scenes activities and the sinister role he played in these events were previously unknown or not clearly understood by people. With the publication of these materials, the truth is now revealed, the dark side is uncovered, and his vicious intentions and cunning methods are exposed to people, which is a contribution to historical research. These materials also provide important clues for studying the internal situation of the feudal ruling class and the struggle and compromise between imperialists.
    Secondly, the editors worked with a serious and responsible attitude, engaging in translation and editing, and paid a great deal of hard work for this. Although we have not been able to compare the hundreds of thousands of words of translation with the original text, we have felt that the translation is clear and fluent, and sometimes even the smug and triumphant expressions and tones when their conspiracies progressed smoothly, and the frustrated and angry expressions when they encountered setbacks, are conveyed. We know that documents and letters are generally difficult to translate. If the translator does not repeatedly deliberate and carefully ponder, it is not easy to achieve this. Secondly, in the published volumes, the editors have done a lot of annotation and proofreading work, which is helpful to users. The editors not only made appropriate introductions to certain important personal names and events that appeared in the book, but also carefully investigated and noted the hidden words used by Hart to prevent telegrams from being leaked, and also copied some important documents and materials that had been carefully selected, and attached them to the relevant letters and telegrams in the form of editors' appendices. These materials can either supplement the deficiencies of the published documents, or facilitate mutual reference, making the published volumes different from simple document publication, and different from simply compiling some relevant materials. In addition, the table of important personal names and place names in Chinese, foreign languages, and the translation that is attached to the end of the book is also useful.
    Of course, there are also some debatable points in the published volumes. First of all, the format of each volume is roughly the same, but there are also some differences. For example, some volumes have introductions, and some volumes do not have introductions. More importantly, "The Chinese Customs and the Sino-Portuguese Lisbon Agreement" and "The Chinese Customs and the Sino-Japanese War" are unpublished archival materials, but "The Chinese Customs and the Sino-French War" contains some selected translations of already published books, in addition to the main parts that were not published before. The first chapter of this volume is the translation of Chapter 17 of Volume 2 of "The History of the Foreign Relations of the Chinese Empire" by the American Morse, and the fifth chapter is a selection of relevant reports from customs commissioners of various countries that have already been published. The latter is rare, but the former is widely circulated. It is also useful for researchers to select, translate, and publish already published materials, but this involves a question, that is, is this book a data book for publishing the old customs, or does it also include some published materials related to each volume in addition to publishing archives? This needs to be clarified. Considering that the General Administration of Customs has accumulated a lot of important archival materials in the past, it is more desirable to adopt the former method in order to concentrate efforts and provide more useful materials in a shorter period of time. As for the work of selecting and compiling relevant published materials, it can be done after a large number of important archives are published, or it can be carried out by other units or individuals.
    Secondly, the editing method can also be further discussed. In the four published volumes, each volume has one or two centers. In order to make the collected materials as consistent as possible with the theme, the editors deleted some materials that were irrelevant or not very relevant to the topic, which can be seen from the discontinuous numbering of letters and telegrams and the deletion marks in the text. In order to manage a large amount of materials with different contents, and to make the materials concentrated and easy to use, classification and editing are necessary, but this method may not be suitable for compiling this data book. From the published volumes, as mentioned above, they are mainly letters and telegrams between Hart and Campbell, and the quantity is not too large, so dispersing them may not be easy to use. Secondly, taking "The Chinese Customs and the Sino-French War" as an example, if only those related to the Sino-French War are taken from the communications between Hart and Campbell from 1883 to 1886, then many materials that cannot be included in this volume or other special topics may be discarded and not used, which will hinder the in-depth understanding of some situations or lose important research clues. The shortcoming of "The Chinese Customs and the Sino-Japanese War" is more obvious. Chapters 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this volume are all telegrams between Hart and Campbell, and the time is from 1894 to 1896. The editors disassembled these letters and telegrams and collected them in relevant chapters separately. In addition to missing some letters and telegrams that cannot be attributed to the four categories, this also separates many events that occurred one after another and at the same time, making it difficult for people to see the connection between these documents. If the method of not dividing volumes and chapters is adopted, and they are arranged completely in chronological order, then all useful and important materials can be preserved, and some of the existing shortcomings can be avoided. Also, because each volume has deletions, some important letters and telegrams related to this volume have also been deleted. For example, before the signing of the Sino-British Tibetan-Indian Supplementary Agreement in 1893, Hart telegraphed Hart's government, asking the latter to sign according to the instructions in his telegrams numbered 197, 198, and 199, but in "The Chinese Customs and the Burmese-Tibetan Question," only the first telegram was included, and the remaining two telegrams were not included, making it difficult for people to understand the content of the latter two telegrams. Similar situations exist in other volumes. In order to remedy this shortcoming, in the future, can the important letters and telegrams that have not been included in each volume be compiled and published in a separate volume. As an addendum.
    In addition, some important unpublished materials, such as Campbell's letters to Hart during the Sino-French War, Campbell's records of the Paris negotiations, and Hart's government's submissions to Hart during the period of the Sino-British agreement on Tibetan-Indian treaties and supplementary agreements, although they are all mentioned in the relevant volumes, it is a pity that they have not been included. If these archives have not been lost, it is best to supplement them, which will be helpful for further research on these issues.

    评“帝国主义与中国海关”
    对外贸易部海关总署研究室编科学出版社出版

    “帝国主义与中国海关”是中国近代经济史资料丛刊的一种，全书共分十余编。现在已经出版的有“中国海关与中法战争”、“中国海关与缅藏问题”、“中国海关与中葡里斯本草约”、“中国海关与中日战争”，排印中的有“中国海关与英德续借款”、“中国海关与义和团运动”，其余各编将于近年内出齐。这部资料书的整理、编辑和出版，将有助于中国近代史、特别是帝国主义侵华历史的深入研究。
    旧中国海关在帝国主义侵略中国的过程中，曾经起过重大的作用。从十九世纪五、六十年代以后的长时期内，中国海关管理权一直操在帝国主义分子手里，他们以此为帝国主义侵略中国服务。而其中窃据海关总税务司职位几乎达半个世纪之久的英国人赫德，更是利用这一机构为外国、特别是为英国效劳的出名人物。已出四编极大部分是赫德与中国海关驻伦敦办事处税务司金登干的往来电报和书信，一小部分则为各国海关税务司给赫德的报告。在过去外国人把持中国海关的时候，这些资料从来是秘不示人的。理由很简单，就是这些文件都是帝国主义侵略中国的铁证，都是他们当时亲手写下来的亲身从事的罪恶活动的记录。解放后，在党和政府的支持下，海关总署研究室将这批保密多年的重要档案，加所整理，译成中文，分编陆续发表出来。它明白告诉人们，过去外国侵略者，如何利用海关为工具，干涉和支配中国的内政外交；帮助人们清楚地了解帝国主义分子控制下的海关和海关中的帝国主义分子活动的真实情况。
    “帝国主义与中国海关”已出各编，具有以下一些特点。
    首先，它为科学研究提供了价值很高的资料，丰富了人们对于帝国主义侵略中国的历史知识。解放以来，随着中国近代史教学与研究工作的逐步开展，我国陆续出版了“中国近代史资料丛刊”和其他一些资料书，便利了历史工作者的参考使用。但就“中国近代史资料丛刊”来说，极大部分是已有成书的编纂，未经刊刻的抄本和原始档案的公布只占一小部分。“帝国主义与中国海关”已出各编的最大特色是，不仅全部资料都是第一次从外文翻译过来的，而且这些从未发表过的重要档案资料第一次以相当完整、相当集中的形式分编公布出来，供研究者利用。这些当事人间相互来往的机密函电，有重要情节的指授，有疑难问题的请示，有工作情况的报告，也有对当时当地复杂情形的反映，都是了解和研究当时历史情况的第一手的可贵资料。“中国海关与中法战争”告诉我们，1885年6月的中法天津条约，是在赫德一手包揽下订立的。根据新资料，我们对这次谈判经过的全面情况有所了解，并且能够断定谈判实际上不是在天津，而是在巴黎进行的。清朝方面的实际谈判者是赫德指使下的金登干，而不是李鸿章。当时李鸿章所起的作用，远不及赫德。“中国海关与缅藏问题”使我们具体知道在这几次对英订约交涉中，赫德如何为英国服务。1886年订立的中英缅甸条约的前三款与他最初向英政府建议的草案内容相同，其他两款也与赫德的活动有关。1890、1893年中英两次订立的有关西藏的条约是赫德、赫政支配、愚弄清朝官吏的“杰作”。出卖澳门领土主权的中葡里斯本草约的订立，是赫德指使金登干积极活动的结果，赫德并由此扩大了权势，把原先广东地方政府设在香港、澳门四周的关卡管理权抢夺到手。中日战争期间清朝对日本的投降活动，赫德虽然没有机会插手，但英德财团取得清政府战后第二次大借款的权利，则是与赫德的积极活动分不开的。赫德在这几次事件中的幕后具体活动情况和所起罪恶作用，是以往人们不知道或者知道得不很清楚的。借助于这些资料的公布，现在真相大白，黑暗面揭开了，他的恶毒用心和狡猾手法暴露在人们的面前，这是对历史研究的贡献。这些资料还提供了研究封建统治阶级内部情况以及帝国主义相互间斗争、妥协的重要线索。
    其次，编者以认真负责的态度，从事翻译、编辑工作，为此付出了大量辛勤的劳动。虽然我们没有能把已经出版的几十万字的译文与原文核对，但已感得译文明确流畅，有时连他们阴谋活动进行顺利时洋洋得意、遭到波折时懊丧恼怒的神情语态也传达出来。我们知道，文件、书信，一般是较难译的，如果译者不反复推敲，仔揣细摩，要做到这一点是不容易的。其次，已出各编，编者做了不少注释、校录的工作，这对使用者是有帮助的。编者不只对书上出现的某些重要人名，某些事件，作了适当的介绍，对赫德为了防止电文泄密使用的一些隐语一一查明注出，并且还抄录了经过审慎选择的一些重要文件资料，用编者附录的形式，附在有关函电的后面。这些资料或者可以补充所公布的文件的不足，或者便于互相参证，使已出各编不同于单纯的文件公布，不同于仅仅把一些有关资料加以编排而已。此外，书后附录的重要人名地名中外文对照表，也有用处。
    当然，已出各编也存在一些可以商榷的地方。首先，各编体例大体是一致的，但也有未尽相同之处。例如，有的编有引言，有的编没有引言。更重要的是，“中国海关与中葡里斯本草约”、“中国海关与中日战争”都是未经公布的档案资料，但“中国海关与中法战争”除主要部分以前未发表过以外。也有一些是已刊成书的选译。这一编第一章是美国人马士所著
  “中华帝国对外关系史”第二卷第十七章的译文，第五章则为已刊的有关各国税务司报告的选辑。后者虽然少见，前者却流传很广。把已有成书资料加以选译出版，对研究者也是有用的，但这里牵涉到一个问题，即究竟这部书是公布旧海关的资料书呢，还是除公布档案外，也兼收一些与各编有关的成书资料？这是需要明确的，考虑到海关总署过去积累的重要档案资料不少，为了集中力量，在较短时间内提供较多的有用资料，采取前一种办法是较为可取的。至于选辑有关成书资料的工作，可以在大量重要档案公布以后再做，或者由其他单位或个人去进行。
    其次，编辑方法也可以进一步讨论。已出四编，每编有一个或两个中心，编者为了使收辑的资料，尽量与主题相配合，把一些与本题无关或关系不多的资料，加以删节，这从函电的编号不连和文内有删节号可知。为了驾驭大量的内容不同的资料，使材料集中，便于利用，分类编辑是必要的，但编这部资料书，这个办法未必一定合适。从已出各编看来，如前所述，主要是赫德与金登干的往来函电，数量还不算太多，分散了不一定便于利用。其次，以“中国海关与中法战争”为例，如果1883—1886年间赫德与金登干的通讯，只取与中法战争有关的，那就可能有许多不能收在这编或其他专题中去的资料摈弃不用，这会妨碍有些情况的深入了解，或者失去重要的研究线索。“中国海关与中日战争”的缺点是比较明显的。这一编的第二、三、四、五各章都是赫德、金登干的往来电讯，时间为1894年到1896年。编者把这些函电拆散，分别收辑在有关章里，这样做除了会漏掉一些不能归于四类的函电外，还把许多先后及同时发生的事情割裂开来，使人们不容易看出这些文件彼此的联系。如果采取不分编、分章的办法，而完全按照时间顺序编排，那就可以保存全部有用的重要材料，也可以避免现在存在的一些缺点。又由于各编都有删节，有些与本编有关的重要函电，也删去了。例如，1893年中英藏印续约签订前，赫德曾电告赫政，要后者根据他发出的编号一九七、一九八、一九九各电的指示签字，但在“中国海关与缅藏问题”里，只收了前面的一则电报，其余两电没有收进去，使人们难以了解后两电的内容。其他编中也存在类似的情况。为了补救这个缺点，将来可否将各编未收的重要函电，另编专册出版。作为补遗。
    此外，有些重要的未发表资料，如中法战争时期金登干致赫德的书信，金登干关于巴黎谈判的记录，中英议订藏印条约和续约时期，赫政致赫德的呈文，虽然在有关的编中都提到了，可惜没有收进去。如果这些档案没有散失，最好加以补充，这对于这些问题的进一步研究将是有帮助的。
