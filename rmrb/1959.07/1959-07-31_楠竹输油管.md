The Mianyang Petroleum Procurement and Supply Station in Sichuan Province, in the upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy, vigorously carried out technological revolution and made an oil pipeline of 260 meters long with moso bamboo. In this way, gasoline and kerosene unloaded from oil tankers at the railway station can flow directly to the oil depot through this oil pipeline. It can save the state more than 150,000 yuan in funds, 5,000 labor days, and 30,000 ton-kilometers of transport capacity throughout the year. Moreover, the operation is simple and greatly reduces the labor intensity of workers.

    楠竹输油管
    四川绵阳石油采购供应站在增产节约运动中，大搞技术革命，用楠竹制成了二百六十米长的输油管。这样，从火车站油罐车卸出的汽油，煤油，通过这条输油管就可以直接流到储油库。全年可为国家节约资金十五万多元，节省劳力五千个、运力三万吨公里，而且操作简便，大大减轻了工人的劳动强度。
