New Branches Added to the Garden of Art

　　Our reporters Zhu Jigong and Hong Helin

　　One evening in mid-July, the rehearsal hall of the Beijing Opera School was filled with melodious music and the flashing of spears and swords. Appearing on stage were the first graduating class of students. They were not very tall, wore special peikao skirts, and their performance and singing revealed a slight youthful naivety. Watching the performance in the audience were their senior predecessors Mei Lanfang, Xun Huisheng, Hao Shouchen, Jiang Miaoxiang, Yao Yufu... This was not an ordinary performance, but a serious "examination." The veteran artists were both like "chief examiners" and kind "mothers." They repeatedly praised the wonderful dance moves and enthusiastically applauded the excellent singing, their faces showing unusual excitement and joy. This was because the students were about to be assigned to the Mei Lanfang, Xun Huisheng, and Shang Xiaoyun troupes to learn and perform, becoming another fresh force to inherit these famous artistic schools. Mei Lanfang excitedly said that adding so many new forces at once was the first time in more than forty years since the establishment of the Cheng Hua Society, the predecessor of the Mei Opera Troupe, and a great happy event for their troupe.

　　This opera school was established in 1952 in Songbai Temple, an old temple in Beijing's pear garden circle where veteran artists used to practice their voices and chat. Initially, there were only twenty rattan poles, six whips, and a practice mat. Seven years have passed, and now it has become a people's, new-style "academy."

　　More than seven years ago, when these students first stepped into the school gate, they were only nine or ten years old, some with red braids in their hair. At that time, they knew nothing about Peking Opera art, and even needed the teachers to take care of their lives. Seven years of hard work, celebrating a bountiful harvest, these new artistic seedlings have gradually grown strong. Now, one-third of them are Party and League members, 50% have a high school education, and they have learned at least thirty plays, and the most can perform more than ninety plays, including "group plays" with all roles of sheng, dan, jing, and chou. The graduates have also cultivated a group of musical talents specializing in managing civil and military scenes. In recent graduation performances, these "new flowers" in the Peking Opera art world have been praised by the audience for their rich fragrance and beautiful colors. After watching their performance, Mei Lanfang believed that the students had a very good foundation and solid skills, and their artistic path was very broad.

　　The 15th was an unforgettable day for these students. The school's academic director announced the distribution list, and the students responded with a long and enthusiastic applause to thank the Party and government for their care and cultivation. At this meeting, the seventy-year-old principal and famous "painted face" Hao Shouchen earnestly taught the students to study hard, win glory for the school, and win glory for the Party. The old principal shouted: "Strive for—", and the students followed with "Upstream!" In an instant, the sound of "Strive for Upstream" shook the hearts of people, and all sixty-five graduates were overjoyed. Of course, the most excited were the old principal and teachers. Over the years, they have not only been patiently guiding in teaching, but also caring for their "children" like "loving mothers." Once, Hao Shouchen found that the voices of the students in the painted face group he taught were not very bright, so he quietly bought a bottle of "autumn pear cream" for them to eat. He also often checked the menu, fearing that the dishes were not suitable for the students' voices.

　　On this day, the students also held a symposium to discuss how to humbly and diligently learn from senior artists and shoulder the glorious task of inheriting the tradition and developing the schools. According to the academic system, these students had to study for another half a year to graduate, but in order to meet the needs of the troupes and the audience, the school decided to graduate them early. In the past, after the old academies "graduated," they usually had to worship famous teachers again, which required spending money on banquets and finding connections. The old artists called this situation of running around and having no way out as "second reincarnation." However, before these young students left the school gate, the Party and government had found these famous teachers for them, and made proper arrangements for everything from learning to life. Many of these students came from families in the pear garden world. Although they were also graduating and finding employment, they had completely different experiences from their fathers and brothers. After the dan role student Li Yufu's brother graduated in his twenties, he invited people and looked for people everywhere, and could not make a living, so he had to leave the stage career. These facts made them understand how to cherish their valuable learning opportunities and how to conscientiously embark on the road of artistic life. New student Li Yufu is good at playing dignified, composed, and graceful qingyi roles. She has learned many Mei school plays and was assigned to work in the Mei Lanfang Troupe. This twenty-year-old girl could not suppress the joy in her heart and told the reporter: "I have especially loved Mei Lanfang's art since I was a child. This opportunity to be personally taught by Teacher Mei Lanfang is something I never imagined. I must study steadily, lay a good foundation, and improve myself in all aspects." The hua dan Li Yalan, who was assigned to the Xun Huisheng Troupe, has a beautiful appearance and a sweet voice. She said: "In the past few years, we have grown up, but the teacher's forehead has increased wrinkles, and silver threads have appeared on the hairline. These wrinkles and silver threads are always the driving force for us to move forward. We must never be complacent because we can perform a few plays, but must train ourselves more humbly and diligently." The thirty students who went to the Xun Troupe with her also put forward their wishes at the symposium: while studying hard, they should seek greater progress in ideological and political terms.

　　These new actors are all striving to become stronger, and the veteran artists are also eager to contribute all their skills. Mei Lanfang told reporters that he would tell these lovely younger generations about his journey and all his experiences anytime, anywhere, bit by bit, and guide them to learn the essence of his school of art, not only to be similar in form, but also to be similar in spirit; at the same time, he would educate the students to continuously improve their ideological and moral cultivation, so as to better enrich their cultural and artistic knowledge. Xun Huisheng prepared to spend two or three months further familiarizing himself with the students' strengths and preferences from the stage and life, and to lecture them on the formation process and characteristics of his school. Then, he would guide them to rehearse "Red Mansion Two You" and the entire "Xun Guan Niang" and other "signature plays." Shang Xiaoyun, who was performing in Xi'an, immediately made a long-distance call when he heard the news of assigning new actors to their troupe, expressing that he would pass on his best plays to the new younger generation.

　　These days, the three troupes of Mei, Xun, and Shang are really filled with joy, and everyone is preparing to welcome the new. The veteran artists' excitement is not difficult to understand. Mei Lanfang wrote in his "Forty Years of Stage Life" eight years ago that the old academies run by private forces in the old society, "are like a small boat in the sea. When encountering wind and waves, the danger of capsizing is inevitable. Only the government can come forward to preside over it, so as to establish a solid foundation, retain the artistic essence of the opera world, add new ideas, and become the most complete stage play. This is not my personal ideal, it will be realized one day." These eight years are not long, and the ideal that Mei Lanfang and many senior artists have dreamed of has become a reality today.

    艺苑添新枝

    7月中旬的一个夜晚，北京戏曲学校排演场里弦歌悦耳，枪飞剑舞。粉墨登场的是即将毕业的第一批学生。他们身材不高，穿着特别的帔靠折裙，表演和行腔中稍稍流露出嫩声稚气。在台下看戏的是他们的老前辈梅兰芳、荀慧生、郝寿臣、姜妙香、姚玉芙……。这不是一场平常的演出，而是一场严肃的“考试”。老艺术家们既像“主考官”，又似慈祥的“母亲”。他们时而对一个精彩的身段的舞蹈连声称好，时而又为一句出色的唱腔热烈鼓掌，他们的脸上呈现出异乎寻常的激动和喜悦。这是因为学员们就要分配到梅兰芳、荀慧生、尚小云剧团里边学习、边演出，将要成为继承这些著名艺术流派的又一批生力军了。梅兰芳兴奋地说，一下子补充这么多新生力量，是从梅剧团的前身承华社成立到现在四十多年以来的第一次，也是他们剧团的一件大喜事。
    这所戏曲学校是1952年，在北京梨园界老艺人调嗓练功、相约叙谈的一所旧庙——松柏庵里建立起来的。当初，只有二十根藤杆，六根马鞭和一块练功的毯子。七年过去了，如今它已成为一所人民的、新型的“科班”。
    七年多以前，这些学生刚迈进学校门坎的时候，只是九岁、十岁左右的小孩子，有的人头上还扎着红辫子呢。那时他们不要说对京剧艺术一无所知，就连自己的生活也需要老师们细心照料。七年辛苦，喜庆丰收，这批艺术新苗逐渐茁壮起来。现在他们中有三分之一是党、团员，50％具有高中文化水平，最少已学会了三十多出戏，最多的能演九十多出戏，其中包括生、旦、净、丑俱全的“群戏”。毕业生中还培养了一批专管文武场面的音乐人材。在最近几次的毕业公演中，这些京剧艺坛上的“新葩”，以自己浓郁的芳香和艳丽的色彩，受到广大观众的赞美。梅兰芳看过他们的演出以后认为，这批学生的基础很好，工夫扎实，他们的艺术道路是很广阔的。
    15日，是这些学员毕生难忘的一天。学校教务长宣布了分配名单，学生们以长时间的热烈掌声答谢党和政府的关怀和栽培。在这个会上，七十多岁的老校长、著名“花脸”郝寿臣谆谆地教导学生，要刻苦学习，给学校争光，给党争光。这位老校长高呼：“力争——”，学生们紧接着喊起“上游”！倾刻间“力争上游”的声浪震人心弦，六十五名毕业生个个喜上眉梢。当然，最激动的，要算这位老校长和教师们了。几年来，他们不仅在教学中循循善诱，而且像“慈母”一样地关心着自己的“孩子”。有一回，郝寿臣发现他亲授的花脸组的学生嗓子不大亮爽，就悄悄地买了瓶“秋梨膏”给他吃。他还经常检查菜单，唯恐菜对学生的嗓子不合适。
    这天，学生们还举行了座谈会，讨论怎样虚心、刻苦地向前辈艺人学习，担负起继承传统，发扬流派的光荣任务。按照学制，这批学生还要学习半年才能毕业，但是为了满足剧团和广大观众的需要，学校决定提早毕业。过去旧科班“出科”以后，照例要再一次投拜名师，这就要花钱请客，找关系，老艺人们称这种四处营钻，走投无路的苦况为“第二次投胎”，然而当这些青年学生还没走出校门，党和政府就给他们找到了这些名师，而且从学习一直到生活都做了妥贴的安排。这批学生中有许多人出身于梨园世家。同样是出科和就业，但是他们和自己的父兄辈却有着完全不同的遭遇。旦角同学李玉芙的哥哥二十几岁出科以后，到处请客找人，生活无着，只好脱离舞台生涯。这些事实，使他们懂得怎样珍惜自己这可贵的学习机会，怎样兢兢业业地踏上艺术生活的道路。新学员李玉芙善演庄丽持重，雍容华贵的青衣戏，她学会了不少梅派戏，这次正好被分配到梅兰芳剧团工作，这个二十岁的姑娘抑止不住心头的喜悦对记者说：“我从小就特别爱好梅兰芳的艺术，这次有机会得到梅兰芳老师的亲自教导，是我从来不曾想到的。我一定要踏踏实实地学习，打好根底，并且全面地提高自己。”被分配到荀慧生剧团的花旦李雅兰扮相清秀，嗓音甜润。她说：这几年中，我们成长起来了，可是老师的额头却增加了皱纹，发际出现了银丝。这皱纹，这银丝，永远是督促我们前进的动力。我们决不以为能演点戏了，就自满起来，而要更加虚心、艰苦地锻炼自己。同她一起到荀剧团的三十个同学在座谈会上，也提出了她们的愿望：要在刻苦学艺的同时，在思想政治上求得更大的进步。
    这一批新演员们个个奋发图强，老艺人们也在磨拳擦掌，准备贡献出自己的全部本领。梅兰芳对记者说，他一定把自己走过的道路和全部经验，随时随地、一点一滴地告诉给这些可爱的后辈，引导他们学到自己这一派艺术的精髓，不仅要做到形似，还要做到神似；同时要教育学生不断提高思想和品德修养，来更好地丰富自己的文化艺术知识。荀慧生准备用两三个月的时间，从舞台上、生活中来进一步熟悉学生的特长和喜好，为学生们讲授本派的形成过程和特点。然后指导他们排“红楼二尤”和全部“荀灌娘”等“看家戏”。正在西安演出的尚小云听到给他们剧团分配新演员的消息，立刻打来了长途电话，表示要把自己的拿手好戏传授给新后辈。
    这几天，梅、荀、尚三个剧团里真是喜气洋溢，人人都在准备迎新。老艺人们的这种兴奋心情是不难理解的。梅兰芳八年以前曾在他的“舞台生活四十年”中写道，旧社会依靠私人力量开办的旧科班，
  “好像大海中的一只小船，遇到风浪，翻船的危险是不可避免的。只有政府出来主持，才能建立巩固的基础，把戏剧界的艺术精华保留下来，新的思想加进去，成为一种最完整的舞台剧。这不是我个人的理想，总有一天会实现的”。这八年时间并不算长，梅兰芳和许多前辈艺人梦寐以求的理想，今天已经成为事实了。（附图片）
