Xinhua News Agency, New York, July 29th: The Communist Party of the United States issued a statement in the "Worker's Weekly" on the 26th, calling on all American working people and the entire labor movement to fully support the steelworkers' strike to ensure the victory of the 500,000 American steelworkers' strike. The statement first pointed out the conspiracy of the American steel monopoly capitalists to deliberately provoke this strike by stubbornly rejecting the steelworkers' reasonable demands in the new contract negotiations. It said, "This is part of a nationwide conspiracy by big business to weaken, undermine, and, if possible, destroy our nation's unions."

The statement then exposed the steel industry bosses' excuse that "wage increases will cause inflation" to reject the workers' demands as completely shameless deception. It pointed out that the steel trusts are trying to conceal the following fact: for every dollar that wages increase, steel companies raise prices by three dollars.

The statement wrote: "The profits extracted by the steel magnates from workers and steel consumers are so large, larger than ever before. For example, 1958 was a recession year, and the operating rate of the American steel industry only reached 60% of its equipment capacity, but in that year, the steel industry obtained a profit of $681.1 million, increased its surplus fund by $114 million, and set up $235 million in new factory equipment. In addition to all this, this huge monopoly organization now has $255 million in cash and $680 million in government securities on hand."

The statement condemned the Eisenhower administration's support for the capitalists in the labor-management negotiations and called on workers to be vigilant against Eisenhower's possible use of the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law to interfere with the strike and crack down on the union. The statement said, "The labor movement should strongly protest against this assistance given by the government to anti-union conspiracies."

The CPUSA statement emphasized: "The steelworkers' strike must be won!" It called out: "To ensure victory, steelworkers must continue to be as united, steadfast, and high-spirited as they are now. Union leaders must trust the steelworkers. Steelworkers must clearly understand the demands of their strike, and these demands must represent their own vital interests. Every international and local union, every city and state labor organization... must immediately provide all possible moral, organizational, and material assistance to the striking steelworkers and their unions. In this great steelworkers' strike, the Communist Party of the United States pledges to do everything possible to make the people understand the cause of the steelworkers and help achieve victory."

The CPUSA statement concluded: "The attack by big business can and must be defeated."

    美国共产党向劳动人民发出号召
    全力支援钢铁工人的罢工斗争
    谴责艾森豪威尔政府帮助资本家进攻工人
    新华社29日讯　纽约消息：美国共产党26日在“工人周报”上发表声明，号召美国全体劳动人民、整个工人运动全力支援钢铁工人的罢工，使五十万美国钢铁工人罢工获得胜利。声明首先指出了美国钢铁垄断资本家在新合同谈判中顽固拒绝钢铁工人的合理要求以蓄意挑起这次罢工的阴谋，它说，“这是大企业想要削弱、破坏而且如果有可能还要摧毁我国工会的全国性阴谋的一部分。”
    声明接着揭穿了钢铁工业老板借口“增加工资会引起通货膨胀”而拒绝工人的要求完全是无耻的欺骗。它指出，钢铁托辣斯力图掩饰下列事实：工资每提高一美元，钢铁公司就把价格提高三美元。
    声明写道：“钢铁大王从工人和钢铁消费者身上所榨取的利润是这样多，多到空前未有。例如，1958年是衰退年，美国钢铁工业的开工率只达到设备能力的60％，但是在这一年，钢铁工业得到了六亿八千一百万美元的利润，增加剩余基金一亿一千四百万美元，设置了二亿三千五百万美元的工厂新设备。除了这一切以外，这个巨大的垄断组织现在手头有二亿五千五百万美元的现款和六亿八千万美元的政府证券。”
    声明谴责艾森豪威尔政府在劳资双方谈判中支持资方的作法，并且号召工人们警惕艾森豪威尔可能援用塔夫脱—哈特莱反劳工法来干涉罢工，打击工会。声明说，“劳工运动对政府给予反工会的阴谋的这种帮助应该提出强烈抗议。”
    美共声明强调指出：“必须使钢铁工人罢工获得胜利！”它号召说：“为了保证胜利，钢铁工人必须继续现在那样团结一致、坚定不移、斗志昂扬。工会领袖们必须信赖钢铁工人。钢铁工人必须明确地知道他们罢工的要求，而这些要求必须代表他们的切身利益。每一个国际和地方工会、每一个城市和州的劳工团体……必须立即在道义、组织和物质方面竭力援助罢工的钢铁工人和他们的工会。在这次钢铁工人大罢工中，美国共产党保证尽一切力量使人民了解钢铁工人的事业，并帮助取得胜利。”
    美共声明最后说：“大企业的进攻是可以而必须击败的。”（附图片）
