    Waste is not "Waste"
    Xu Da
    Waste is often considered "waste" not because it has completely lost its utility, but because people disregard it and fail to utilize it.
    An outdated newspaper may have lost its usefulness in some respects, but it still has many uses for wrapping things, wallpapering, making paper boxes, etc. Even if it is already torn, it remains a good raw material for papermaking if handed over to a paper mill. Some people call old newspapers "waste newspapers," which shows that the word "waste" only applies to a specific use and does not mean it is completely without any utility.
    Even in terms of an item's specific utility, people's standards for measuring "waste" versus "not waste" often vary considerably. Some people, when drafting a document, might write only three or two lines and, just because a word is written incorrectly, crumple the entire sheet and throw it into the wastepaper basket. In their view, this paper is already "waste." But if this situation were to happen to someone who cherishes national resources, they would not discard it so arbitrarily. They would either cross out the wrong word and continue writing, or cut the blank paper and save it for other uses, or even finish writing on one side and then turn it over to write on the other side, always trying to make the most of it instead of easily labeling it "waste" and wasting something that is still useful. A pair of broken shoes might be thrown into the garbage heap by some, mended and worn by others, or picked up and given to a waste recycling station as industrial raw material. It is clear that whether an item is "waste" or "not waste" is often not due to its inherent loss of utility, but is determined by people's perception of it. Many items that could have been used for a longer time or utilized in other ways are wasted in this way.
    Perhaps some people think that although waste can be utilized, its value is ultimately not great. However, this is not the case. A news item titled "Large Amounts of Waste Turned into Treasures" in the People's Daily on June 8th serves as an example. The value of waste recovered by the waste recycling department in Shenyang from March 20th to the end of May was 6.6 million yuan. In April alone, they supplied 890 tons of waste paper to paper mills and more than 180 tons of waste rubber to a rubber factory. They supplied industrial departments with more than 1,020 tons of metal raw materials such as steel, iron, lead, and tin. A city has achieved such great results in a very short period of time. If the whole country were to do this, and continue to do so in the long term, what astonishing results would be achieved? This is only in terms of economic aspects. If we talk about promoting a diligent and thrifty ethos, developing habits of frugality, and cultivating new social morals, the significance is far more than just a few numbers can explain.

### 废物不“废”

    废物不“废”
    徐达
    废物之所以“废”，常常不是由于它本身完全失去了使用价值，而是由于人们不把它放在眼里，对它不加以利用。
    一张过时的旧报纸，可能在某些方面失去了作用，但用来包东西、糊墙壁、做纸盒子等还有不少用途；即使是已经破烂，如果交给造纸厂，仍不失为一种很好的造纸原料。有些人把旧报纸叫做“废报纸”，可见这个“废”字，只不过是就其某一种用途而言，并不是真的完全没有任何使用价值了。
    即使就物品的某一种使用价值而言，人们衡量其“废”与“不废”的标准也往往颇有悬殊。有些人起草一个文件时，写上三行两行，只因为一个字写错了就把整张纸一揉往废纸篓里一丢，在他看来这张纸已经“废”了。而这种情况如果遇在一个爱惜国家资财的人手里，他就不至于这样任意丢掉。他或者是涂掉那个错字继续写下去，或者把空白的纸裁下来留作别的用途，或者甚至写完了这一面还要翻过来再写那一面，总要想办法尽力加以利用，而不是轻易把“废”字加上去，把本来还有用的东西浪费掉。一双破鞋，有人把它甩到垃圾堆里，有人把它补一补又穿上，有人把它拾起来交给废品收购站作工业原料，可见一件物品“废”与“不废”，往往不是由于其本身失去了使用价值，而是人们对它所持的看法把它决定了。有不少本来还可以延长时间使用或者从其它方面加以利用的物品就这样被人浪费掉了。
    也许有人以为废物虽可利用，但其价值究竟不大，事实并不如此，6月8日人民日报上有一则题为“大量废物变活宝”的消息，可作一个例证。沈阳市废品收购部门自3月20日至5月底收回的废物价值六百六十万元，仅4月份一个月他们即供给造纸厂废纸八百九十吨，供给某橡胶厂废橡胶一百八十多吨。供给工业部门钢、铁、铅、锡等金属原料一千零二十多吨。一个城市在一段很短的时间内就收到这样大的效果，如果全国如此，长期如此，其结果将会怎样惊人呢？这还只是就经济方面来说，如果从提倡勤俭风尚，养成节约习惯，培养新的社会道德来说，其意义就更不是几个数字所能说明了。
