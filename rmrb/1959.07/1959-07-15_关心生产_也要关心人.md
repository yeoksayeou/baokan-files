Editor's Note:

    Pay Attention to Production, But Also to People
    July's heat is scorching.
    The summer harvest and planting are entering a tense stage. Tens of millions of commune members are fighting in the fields under the scorching sun. They are selflessly racing against the seasons and seizing the opportune time to harvest the crops and sow more seeds for future harvests.
    At this time of intense heat and heavy labor, when production is extremely urgent, it is even more necessary to care for the lives and health of the commune members. If arrangements are made properly, the morale of the commune members will be further boosted, and labor efficiency can also be significantly improved.
    Today, this newspaper published a special column - "Hot Weather, Heavy Work, More Need to Care for People," which reports on the arrangements for the lives of commune members during the busy summer harvest season from various aspects. It is highly commendable. It's very interesting to have storytelling and singing during breaks in the fields; and if someone suffers from heatstroke, there are rescue teams and medical teams readily available. After work, sitting in a clean and cool canteen and eating a satisfying meal; then taking a bath in a simple bathroom, all the day's fatigue disappears. Tomorrow, they can devote themselves to new battles with even greater strength!

    关心生产  也要关心人
    七月流火，炎暑逼人。
    夏收夏种正进入紧张阶段，数以千万计的社员正战斗在烈日下的田野间。他们奋不顾身，抢季节，赶火候，把丰收的粮食拿到手，又把更多的丰收的种籽播种下去。
    在这天热活重，生产万分紧张的时候，更需要关心社员的生活和健康。安排妥贴了，社员情绪就会更加高涨，劳动工效也能显著提高。
    今天本报发表的一个专栏——“天热活重，更要关心人”，从各方面报道了夏收大忙季节对社员生活的安排，是很值得提倡的。在田间休息的时候，说说唱唱，十分有趣；万一天热有人中暑，救护队、医疗队一应俱全。劳动完毕，坐到干净凉爽的食堂里，吃上顿可心饭；再到简易浴室去洗个澡，一天的疲劳都消失了。明天，就可以带着更大的力量投入新的战斗！
