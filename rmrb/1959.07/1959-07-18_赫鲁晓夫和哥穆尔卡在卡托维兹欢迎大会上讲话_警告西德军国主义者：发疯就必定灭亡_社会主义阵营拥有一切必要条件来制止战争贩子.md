Xinhua News Agency, July 17th, Katowice dispatch from TASS: A grand mass rally was held on the 16th in Katowice, the center of Poland's Silesian industrial region, to welcome the Soviet Party and Government delegation headed by Khrushchev.

When Khrushchev, Gomulka, and members of the Soviet Party and Government delegation appeared on the rostrum, the participants in the rally applauded warmly and shouted "Hurrah!" to welcome them.

Gomulka and Khrushchev spoke at the rally.

In his speech, Gomulka pointed out that the Polish people will never forget the pivotal moment when the Soviet army and the Polish army fighting alongside it drove the evil Hitlerite occupiers from Polish soil, enabling Poland to regain its independence. He emphasized that People's Poland was not only able to rebuild from the ruins, but also to increase its industrial output to six times that of 1938. In this regard, the Soviet Union has played and continues to play a significant role in providing fraternal assistance to Poland. Gomulka pointed out that the fraternal friendship, mutual assistance, and ideological unity between the Soviet Union and Poland are of great significance not only for the two countries but also as a crucial international factor. He said that the cooperation and unbreakable unity of the socialist countries are a tremendous force for defending peace and security in Europe and are the most effective resistance against the forces of war and imperialist aggression.

Speaking about the policies of West German militarism, Gomulka said that the Bonn government's policies, Adenauer's policies, are manifested in principles such as: making no concessions in negotiations with the East, demanding what cannot be obtained, patiently waiting for the best opportunity, and simultaneously arming, arming, and arming again in order to maintain and intensify the atmosphere of the Cold War.

Gomulka then said that the aggressive words and deeds of West German militarists and all sorts of politicians in Bonn are a threat to peace and a threatening factor in escalating tensions in Europe.

Gomulka pointed out that the German question should be resolved in accordance with the interests of peace. The Federal Republic of Germany will never be able to annex and eliminate the German Democratic Republic. Only the conclusion of an agreement between the two German states can resolve the issue of German reunification.

Gomulka emphasized that Poland fully supports the Soviet proposal to eliminate the occupation regime in West Berlin. He said, we are willing to believe that reason will ultimately prevail among Western politicians, and all disputes will be resolved through negotiations. The people of all countries are now demanding this more and more strongly.

In his speech, Khrushchev said that the Soviet people are the most loyal friends and brothers of the Polish people. This is completely reliable.

Khrushchev pointed out that under the great banner of Marxism-Leninism, nearly one billion socialist and communist builders are now united into a unified and powerful socialist camp. In our countries, communism is now being transformed from a human aspiration into an increasingly closer future that our generation can achieve. Although the countries of the socialist camp are currently at different stages of socialist and communist construction, the time is not far off when all the people of the socialist countries will begin to transition to a communist society at roughly the same time.

Khrushchev expressed his complete agreement with Gomulka's remarks about German revanchists in his speech.

Khrushchev said that everyone knows that revanchist sentiments were already burning fiercely in Germany after the First World War. The madman Hitler was particularly zealous in this regard, establishing his own revanchist party and calling it the Nazi Party. He believed that fascist Germany should rule Europe and that the people of other countries should carry out his will. This absurd fantasy has gone bankrupt, and those who put forward such claims are already rotting underground. Has Chancellor Adenauer forgotten this recent history? Khrushchev said, but this history should not be forgotten.

Khrushchev pointed out that the balance of power on the world stage is also different now. There is now a powerful socialist camp that possesses all the necessary conditions to stop ambitious warmongers. Mr. Adenauer can be told this: If you, Mr. Chancellor, are delusional enough to infringe upon the socialist countries, then you won't even have the chance to crawl out of your lair.

Khrushchev pointed out that the strength of the working people of all countries has now grown to such an extent that there is every possibility of further normalizing the international situation and strengthening world peace. He said that the current international situation is not bad. Those keen on military adventures have to consider the power of the increasingly powerful socialist camp and the will of the people of all countries who oppose using war as a means of resolving international issues. He said that we believe that as long as those who hate war work together, we will be able to ensure peace in Europe and the world and create more favorable external conditions for the victorious construction of socialism and communism.

### 赫鲁晓夫和哥穆尔卡在卡托维兹欢迎大会上讲话  警告西德军国主义者：发疯就必定灭亡  社会主义阵营拥有一切必要条件来制止战争贩子

    赫鲁晓夫和哥穆尔卡在卡托维兹欢迎大会上讲话
    警告西德军国主义者：发疯就必定灭亡
    社会主义阵营拥有一切必要条件来制止战争贩子
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社卡托维兹讯：波兰的西里西亚工业区中心——卡托维兹16日举行了盛大的群众大会，欢迎以赫鲁晓夫为首的苏联党政代表团。
    当赫鲁晓夫、哥穆尔卡和苏联党政代表团的团员出现在主席台上时，参加大会的人热烈鼓掌并高呼“乌拉！”欢迎他们。
    哥穆尔卡和赫鲁晓夫先后在大会上讲了话。
    哥穆尔卡在讲话中指出，波兰人民永远不会忘记这样的转折时刻：苏联军队和同它并肩作战的波兰军队从波兰国土上赶走了万恶的希特勒占领者，使波兰重新获得独立。他强调指出，人民波兰不仅能够从废墟中重新建设起来，而且能把工业产品增加到为1938年的六倍，在这方面，苏联过去和现在继续给波兰的兄弟援助起了重大的作用。哥穆尔卡指出，苏波两国的兄弟友谊、互相帮助和思想意识的一致不仅对波苏两国有重大的意义，而且也是极重要的国际因素。他说，社会主义国家的合作和牢不可破的团结一致是保卫欧洲的和平和安全的巨大力量，是反对战争势力、反对帝国主义侵略势力的最有效的阻力。
    哥穆尔卡在谈到西德军国主义的政策时说，波恩政府的政策，阿登纳的政策表现在这样的一些原则上：在同东方谈判时不作丝毫让步，要求得到决不能得到的东西，耐心地等待最好的时机，同时进行武装、武装、再武装，以便保持和加剧冷战气氛。
    哥穆尔卡接着说，西德军国主义者和波恩形形色色的政客的侵略言行是对和平的威胁，是加剧欧洲紧张局势的威胁性的因素。
    哥穆尔卡指出，德国问题应当根据和平的利益来解决。德意志联邦共和国永远吞并不了和消灭不了德意志民主共和国。只有两个德国之间缔结协定才能解决德国重新统一的问题。
    哥穆尔卡强调指出，波兰完全支持苏联提出的关于消除西柏林占领制度的建议。他说，我们愿意相信，在西方政治家中理智终将占上风，一切争端都将通过谈判来解决。各国人民现在越来越强烈的要求这样做了。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中说，苏联人民是波兰人民最忠实的朋友和兄弟。这一点是完全可靠的。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，在马克思列宁主义的伟大旗帜下，近十亿社会主义和共产主义建设者现在团结成一个统一的强大的社会主义阵营。在我们这些国家中，共产主义现在正在从人类的宿愿变成我们这一代人就可以达到的、日益接近的未来。虽然社会主义阵营国家目前还处在社会主义和共产主义建设的不同阶段，但是，社会主义国家全体人民将大致同时开始过渡到共产主义社会的时候已经不远了。
    赫鲁晓夫表示完全同意哥穆尔卡在讲话中关于德国复仇主义分子的谈话。
    赫鲁晓夫说，大家知道，在第一次世界大战后，德国的复仇主义情绪就已经炽烈地燃烧了。发疯的希特勒在这方面特别卖力，他建立了自己的复仇主义党，并且取名为纳粹党。他认为，法西斯德国应当统治欧洲，而其他各国人民应当执行他的意志。这种妄诞的幻想已经破产了，而提出这种主张的人也已经在地下腐烂了。阿登纳总理难道就忘记了这个不久以前的历史了吗？赫鲁晓夫说，但是，这段历史是不应当忘记的。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，现在世界舞台上的力量对比也不同了。现在存在着强大的社会主义阵营，它拥有一切必要的条件来制止野心勃勃的战争贩子。可以这样告诉阿登纳先生：如果您，总理先生，妄想侵犯社会主义国家，那末您连从您的窝里爬出来的机会都没有。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，各国劳动人民的力量现在已经壮大到这样的程度，使得现在有一切可能来使国际局势更加正常化和加强世界和平。他说，现在国际局势并不坏。热衷于军事冒险的人不得不考虑日益强大的社会主义阵营的威力，不得不考虑反对把战争当作解决国际问题的手段的各国人民的意志。他说，我们相信，只要憎恨战争的人齐心努力，我们就能够确保欧洲和世界和平，就能够给胜利地进行社会主义和共产主义建设创造更有力的外部条件。（附图片）
