    Moscow Dispatch, July 4th: The resolutions of the June Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee have aroused enormous political and labor enthusiasm among the Soviet people. At rallies and forums held across the country to celebrate the June Plenary Session, people expressed their determination to devote all their efforts to further improving labor productivity and to comprehensive mechanization and automation.
    In the mines, factories, and construction sites of the Donbas, rallies are being held everywhere to discuss the plenary session documents and express their determination to realize the plenary session's resolutions. At a rally in the Chistiakovo mine, workers unanimously decided to complete the mine reconstruction work one year ahead of schedule and reach the 1965 production level by 1963, and to complete this year's plan ahead of schedule.
    At a rally at the Leningrad Metal Factory, after discussing the documents, the employees decided to fulfill the task of producing steam gas and hydraulic turbines, originally scheduled for 1965, one year ahead of schedule.
    The working people of Belarus are determined to launch a socialist competition to complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule and adopt scientific and technological achievements more quickly. At a rally at the Belarusian Automobile Plant, Skolokhot, the work team leader who is striving for the title of Communist Labor Team, said, "There is no more important task for us now than to complete the Seven-Year Plan. We guarantee to complete the Seven-Year Plan in five and a half years."
    Machine designers at the Ural Machine-Building Plant stated at the meeting that they must design the world's most economical and efficient machines. All the workers assured the Party Central Committee that they would complete the production level stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan in six years.
    Workers at the Estonian Cable Factory summarized the technical innovation movement in the first half of the year at a rally celebrating the closing of the plenary session. The factory's employees made more rationalization proposals in the first half of this year than in the entire year of last year. At the meeting, it was decided to complete the production level targets stipulated in the Seven-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule on the basis of mechanizing and automating the production process without increasing investment.
    The June Plenary Session documents are being discussed in the vast rural areas. In the fields of the Stavropol region in the south, where the summer harvest is underway, the villagers gather during lunch breaks to discuss. After discussing the letter from the CPSU Central Committee to the working people, the Kalinin Collective Farm decided to complete the harvest within ten days and complete the grain delivery plan before July 24.
