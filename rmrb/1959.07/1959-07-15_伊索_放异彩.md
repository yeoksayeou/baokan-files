"Aesop" Radiates Splendor
	Cai Yun

Among Brazilian writers, besides the novelist Amado whom we are familiar with, we now know the outstanding playwright Figueredo. His play "Aesop" is currently being performed at the Beijing People's Art Theatre. Figueredo calls "Aesop" a "heroic comedy" because Aesop fell while fighting for freedom, but awakened thousands upon thousands of slaves to stand up; the content of the play "Aesop" is a call to all oppressed and enslaved people around the world to fight against national oppression and social oppression. The deeds of a hero who sacrifices himself for a noble cause are not a tragedy, but an optimistic comedy. After watching "Aesop," the audience will gain a kind of strength: to hate today's colonial system and slavery system even more, to love freedom even more, and to strive for liberation more resolutely.

Although Figueredo encountered a lot of indifference when he brought his play to the Brazilian stage, his "Aesop" has been performed almost all over the world in less than five or six years, in the Americas and Europe, and now it is beginning to meet with the broad masses in Asia.

When watching "Aesop," we feel that the reason it can transcend Brazil's national boundaries and be quickly performed in various countries around the world is not only because it adopts "eternal themes" and "universal themes," but also because it has high achievements in dramatic art.

The material of "Aesop" truly achieves "making the past serve the present." The author not only incorporates Aesop's fables into the play, but also treats Aesop himself as the protagonist of the play. The legends left over from more than two thousand years ago only have a few words: Aesop was a slave of a Greek philosopher, he was born ugly, but extremely intelligent, and his fables were very popular. Although he later gained freedom, he was pushed off a cliff to his death. With just such a little material, the playwright, through rich imagination, has compiled such a good play with profound meaning and realistic themes. The author uses the most familiar fable "The Fox and the Grapes" as the main line, and strings together many other Aesop's fables, forming a novel script.

The author develops the so-called eternal theme of "love" into a conflict between love and freedom, thereby raising the theme to a higher level. As the central idea of the whole play, the author is not limited to expressing this conflict, he emphasizes the preciousness of freedom, that one can sacrifice love for freedom, and sacrifice life for freedom. Such a theme is even more sublime. With such a theme, the ancient material from more than two thousand years ago can be "put to use" today.

As a play, an engaging plot is necessary. Through intricate love relationships and complex causes of disputes, the author lays out a moving plot. Aesop and Cléa, Gessner and Cléa, Cléa and the Guard Captain, Melinda and Gessner, Melinda and the Abyssinian... a total of six people, there are so many love relationships between each other, each relationship is different, the development is different, and the results are also different, so the audience sees a lot of plot drama here. All these complex plots serve only one general theme. Thus, the author does not shout a single political slogan in the entire play, but achieves extremely high political effect.

The entire play has only six people, one of whom does not speak at all, and another who only says a few words, so in fact six people are acting and four people are speaking. The personalities and thoughts of the six people are very distinct and have characteristics, and these characteristics develop with the development of the plot. Simplifying the characters also makes it possible to finely sculpt the characters.

The handling of the masses is also extremely prominent in "Aesop." This is completely different from the tendency of plays we often see that are for the masses for the sake of the masses. The role of the masses in history should be fully affirmed, but if a large number of masses who have no relationship with the development of the entire drama are pulled onto the stage to "play extras" in order to show this point, this is definitely not a brilliant method. Although there is not a single mass person on stage in "Aesop," the entire play is shrouded in the atmosphere of the masses. Crowds gather in the square to listen to the philosopher Gessner speak; people all over the street are arguing about Gessner's marriage; Aesop tells people fables, the crowd is excited and cheers are endless; surging crowds watch Gessner "drink up the sea" on the coast, and later they indignantly demand the release of Aesop; Aesop pushes aside the noisy crowd and rushes towards the cliff...

The surging atmosphere of the masses in "Aesop" is not only achieved by relying on stage effects, but mainly by relying on the play on stage.

The refinement of language is especially a major success of "Aesop." Powerful, profound, moving, and interesting dialogues are the characteristics of "Aesop," but the author can refine the language to such an extent that there is not a single word of nonsense in the entire play, layer upon layer, step by step, it can indeed be said that every word has been tempered.

The difference between spoken drama and other drama types lies in its ability to reflect life, raise questions in life, and answer these questions through refined and sharp language. Spoken drama has such performance, so it is most suitable for promoting new ideas. Or, conversely, the task of spoken drama is to promote new ideas of life through carefully selected language. The lines of spoken drama must not copy ordinary language from daily life. In "Aesop," everyone's lines, especially Aesop's lines, are truly pearls of wisdom, beautiful and cannot be exhausted, some words are philosophical aphorisms, full of profound meaning. But for all these profound languages, the audience does not complain that they are difficult to understand, but happily accepts them.

The Beijing People's Art Theatre has obviously made great efforts in the performance of this play. What is first gratifying is that so many meaningful and profound lines (and it is a translated script) can be clearly transmitted to the audience's ears word by word. This is undoubtedly the result of the tenacious study and repeated processing of the entire cast. The absence of curtains is also a novel attempt. During the intermissions, male and female slaves silently move props on the stage, forming an integral part of the play. The director's handling is very successful. The director's success is also reflected in the grasp of the central idea of the whole play, the proper arrangement of dramatic conflicts, and the beautiful and dramatic use of columns, steps, and space.

The scene in the second act where Cléa expresses her love to Aesop, I don't know why it was not handled according to the spirit of the original. This is one of the climaxes of the whole play. Aesop has a strong inner struggle here. He once admitted that Cléa was the woman of his dreams. Besides other reasons, Aesop's words of praise that touched the depths of her soul are also an important reason for Cléa's love for Aesop, but these words were not emphasized during the performance. Expressing Aesop's contradictory feelings here will only highlight his determination to strive for freedom even more, and make Cléa's decision to take on the death penalty herself in order to save Aesop in the last scene more based.

Lü Qi completed Aesop's task very well, his enunciation was clear, and his attitude was appropriate. It is just that his makeup lacks one or two "close-ups" of "ugliness" required by the drama. As it is now, he is not uglier than Gessner and the Abyssinian. It is certainly not allowed to uglify such a hero, but it is still necessary to outline his ugly features. The last few syllables of some key lines of Aesop are often eaten by the actor himself, which is also a deficiency. Shu Xiuwen used her skilled acting skills to prominently shape the image of Cléa, who has the most changes in thought and emotion in the whole play. She expressed the changes in her thoughts and feelings through many static scenes, so that the audience did not feel that all of Cléa's actions were abrupt and without basis, and gave her sympathy. Fang Guande, who played the philosopher, appropriately conveyed the ugly face of the hypocritical, foolish, greedy, and cruel slave owner, but he lacked some of the temperament of a philosopher in his behavior. Other actors were also able to serve the theme of the whole play and played their due role.

The performance of "Aesop" is an unusual flower in the theater scene in recent years. Figueredo's achievements in taking materials, shaping characters, refining language, etc., will have a positive impact on the cause of Brazilian and Chinese drama art exchanges.

### “伊索”放异彩

    “伊索”放异彩
    蔡云
    在巴西作家中，除了我们熟悉的小说家亚马多之外，现在我们又知道了杰出的剧作家菲格莱德。他的戏剧“伊索”现在正在北京人民艺术剧院上演。菲格莱德把“伊索”称为“英雄喜剧”，因为伊索为争取自由而倒下去，却唤醒千千万万的奴隶站起来；戏剧“伊索”的内容是号召全世界被压迫被奴役的人，为反对民族压迫和社会压迫而斗争。为崇高目的而牺牲的英雄，他的事迹不是悲剧，而是乐观的喜剧。观众看完了
  “伊索”会得到一种力量：更加仇恨今天的殖民制度和奴役制度，更加热爱自由和更加坚决争取解放。
    虽然菲格莱德带着他的剧作走上巴西剧坛，曾遭受不少冷遇，但是他的“伊索”在不到五六年的时间中，几乎演遍全世界，在美洲和欧洲，现在又开始在亚洲，和广大群众见面。
    在看“伊索”的时候，我们觉得它所以能超出巴西的国界，迅速地在世界各国演出，不仅是由于它采用了“永久的题材”和“世界的题材”，更因为它在戏剧艺术上有很高的成就。
    “伊索”的取材，真正做到了“古为今用”。作者不仅采伊索寓言入戏，而且把伊索本人作为剧中主人公来处理。二千多年遗留下来的传说，只有寥寥几句：伊索是希腊一个哲学家的奴隶，他生得丑陋异常，但聪明过人，他编的寓言极受人们的欢迎，他后来虽然取得自由，但被人推落悬崖而死。就是这么一点素材，经过剧作家的丰富想像，编成了现在这样一个寓意深远、题材现实的好戏。作者利用人们最熟悉的寓言“狐狸与葡萄”作为主线，和许多别的伊索寓言连串起来，构成一个风格新颖的剧本。
    作者把“爱情”这个所谓永久的题材，发展为爱情与自由的冲突，因而把主题提高了一步。作为全剧的中心思想，作者还不限于表现这个冲突，他强调自由的可贵，可以为自由牺牲爱情，为自由牺牲生命。这样的主题就更高超了。有这样的主题，于是二千多年前的古材料，便为今天“派用场”了。
    作为戏，引人入胜的情节是必要的。通过错综的恋爱关系，复杂的纠纷原因，作者铺陈出动人的情节。伊索和克莉娅，格桑和克莉娅，克莉娅和卫队长，梅丽达和格桑，梅丽达和阿比西尼亚人……统共六个人，相互之间竟有这么多的爱情关系，每种关系不同，发展不同，结果因而也不同，使观众在这里看到不少情节戏。所有这些复杂的情节，只为一个总的主题服务。于是作者在整个戏里没有喊一句政治口号，却达到了极高的政治效果。
    全剧只有六个人，其中有一个人根本没有说话，还有一个人只说了几句话，所以实际是六个人在演戏，四个人在说话。六个人的性格和思想都很鲜明，都有特点，而且这些特点都随着剧情的发展而发展。精简了人物，也就能精塑人物。
    群众的处理，在“伊索”里也表现得极为突出。这和我们常看到的为群众而群众的剧作倾向完全不同。群众在历史中的作用是完全应该肯定的，但是如果为了表明这一点而把与整个戏剧发展没有关系的大批群众拉上舞台“跑龙套”，这决不是高明的办法。“伊索”虽然没有一个群众上场，但是整个戏都被笼罩在群众的气氛里。广场上聚集着人群听哲学家格桑讲话；满街的人争说格桑要结婚；伊索给人们讲寓言，群情激动，欢声不绝；汹涌的人群在海岸上争看格桑“喝干大海”，后来他们又愤慨地要求释放伊索；伊索拨开吵嚷的人群奔向悬崖……
    汹涌的群众气氛，在“伊索”里，不仅依靠舞台效果来达到，而主要是依靠台上的戏来达到的。
    语言的洗练，尤其是“伊索”的重大成功。有力的、深刻的、动人的、有趣的对话，是“伊索”的特点，但是作者能把语言洗练到这样的程度，全剧没有一句废话，一层进一层、一步紧一步，确实可以说每一个字都是经过锤炼的。
    话剧和其他剧种不同，就在于它能通过洗练的、犀利的语言，反映生活、提出生活里的问题，并且解答这些问题。话剧具有这样的性能，所以最适于宣传新的思想。或者反过来说：话剧的任务就在于通过精选的语言，宣传生活的新思想。话剧的台词决不能搬用日常生活里的普通语言。在“伊索”里，每个人的台词，特别是伊索的台词，真是妙语如珠，美不胜收，有些话是哲理警句，意味深长。但是所有这些深刻的语言，观众不是抱怨难懂，而是高兴地接受。
    北京人民艺术剧院在这个戏的演出上，显然作了很大的努力。首先使人欣喜的是：包含这么许多意义深刻、哲理深奥的台词（而且是翻译剧本），竟能这样清楚地一字一句地传达到观众的耳朵里，这无疑是整个演出人员顽强钻研、反复加工的结果。不用戏幕也是新颖的尝试。幕间由男女奴隶默默地在台上搬道具，形成戏的一个组成部分，导演处理得很成功。导演的成功还表现在对全剧中心思想的掌握上，戏剧纠纷的恰当安排上，对圆柱、台阶、空间的幽美而又戏剧性地利用上。
    第二幕克莉娅向伊索表示爱情的那场戏，不知为什么没有按原作的精神来处理。这是全剧的高潮之一，伊索在这里有强烈的内心斗争，他曾承认克莉娅是他幻想的女人。克莉娅的爱伊索，除了别的原因之外，伊索那些打动她心灵深处的赞美之词，也是重要原因，但演出时这些话都没有强调出来。在这里表现伊索的矛盾感情，只会把他争取自由的决心衬托得更突出，并且使最后一场克莉娅为了救伊索而自己承担死罪的决定更有根据。
    吕齐很好地完成了伊索的任务，他的口齿清楚，态度适当，就是在他的化装上缺乏一两笔戏剧所需要的“丑陋”的“特写”，照现在的样子，他并不比格桑和阿比西尼亚人丑陋，丑化这样的英雄固然要不得，但给他勾画出丑的特征还是必要的。伊索某些关键性的台词，末尾几个字音常常被演员自己吃掉，也是美中不足之处。舒绣文用她老练的演技突出地塑造了这个在全剧中思想感情变化最多的克莉娅的形象。她通过许多静场戏表现了她的思想感情的变化，使观众不觉得克莉娅的一切行动突兀而无根据，并且对她寄予同情。演哲学家的方琯德恰当地传达了虚伪、愚蠢、贪婪、残忍的奴隶主的丑恶面目，只是在举止上少表现了一些哲学家的气质。其他演员也都能为全剧的主题服务，起了应有的作用。
    “伊索”的演出是近年剧坛上的一朵异葩，菲格莱德在取材、塑造人物、洗练语言等等方面的成就，将在巴西和中国戏剧艺术交流事业中，产生良好的影响。
