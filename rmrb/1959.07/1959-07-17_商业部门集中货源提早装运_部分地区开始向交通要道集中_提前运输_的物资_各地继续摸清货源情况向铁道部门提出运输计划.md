Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Commercial departments in some areas have already begun to concentrate goods and ship out some materials that can be transported in advance during the third quarter. According to statistics up to the 15th, the seven provinces and cities of Hebei, Jilin, Anhui, Zhejiang, Henan, Hunan, and Beijing are preparing to transport a total of 164,314 tons of goods in advance. This includes cotton, hemp, cotton stalk skins, chemical raw materials, and papermaking raw materials, as well as local products and waste products such as mao bamboo, reed mats, and scrap steel. At present, the railway department has included 114,600 tons in the advance shipment plan and is shipping them successively. Salt-producing areas such as Hebei, Liaoning, and Jiangsu are also preparing to ship 450,000 tons of salt, which was originally scheduled for the fourth quarter, in advance during the third quarter. Currently, arrangements have been made for the sources of these advance-shipped salt.

At the end of June, the Ministry of Commerce, together with the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications, issued a notice to all localities, requiring commercial departments in all localities to transport materials that are transported by rail, the Yangtze River, and coastal shipping, and that can be transported in advance, as much as possible in July and August. The notice requires that materials that have already been transported to stations and docks should be organized for loading and transportation immediately; for materials that have not yet been concentrated, vigorous efforts should be made to improve short-distance transportation, organize transportation capacity to concentrate them to transportation hubs as soon as possible, and wait for loading and transportation. After receiving the notice, commercial departments in various localities immediately took action. The commercial bureaus of Sichuan, Shandong, Hunan and other provinces reported to the local transportation command and studied and deployed this work. Commercial departments in Heilongjiang, Henan, Jilin and other provinces also immediately ascertained the sources of goods and directly submitted advance transportation plans to the railway transportation departments.

    新华社16日讯　部分地区商业部门已经开始集中货源，把一些可以提前运输的物资提前在第三季度运出。根据到15日止的统计，河北、吉林、安徽、浙江、河南、湖南、北京等七个省市准备提前运输的物资共有十六万四千三百十四吨，这里面有棉花、麻类、棉秆皮、化工原料和造纸原料，还有毛竹、苇箔、废钢铁等土产和废品。目前铁道部门已列入提前装运计划，并且陆续发运的有十一万四千六百多吨。河北、辽宁、江苏等产盐地区还准备把第四季度装运的盐提前在第三季度装运四十五万吨，目前这些提前装运的盐，货源已作了安排。
    商业部在6月底曾分别和铁道、交通两部向各地发出通知，要求各地商业部门把经过铁路、长江、沿海运输而又可能提前运输的物资，尽可能地在7、8两月内提前运输。通知要求，目前已经运到车站、码头的物资，要立即组织装运；尚未集中的物资，要大力搞好短途运输，组织运力尽快地向交通要道集中，等待装运。各地商业部门接到通知之后，立即行动起来。四川、山东、湖南等省商业厅向当地运输指挥部作了汇报，并且研究部署了这一工作。黑龙江、河南、吉林等省商业部门也立即摸清货源情况，直接向铁路运输部门提出了提前运输的计划。
