The Hubei Provincial Department of Commerce and the Yangxin County Bureau of Commerce jointly researched and created a Type 59-1 hand-operated ramie scutching machine. This scutching machine has high production efficiency. One person can operate it to scutch over twenty catties (dry weight) of ramie per day, which is five to ten times more efficient than using the old-style ramie knife. The scutched ramie is neat and uniform, and every hundred catties of ramie bark can reduce waste by eight catties. The machine has a simple structure and low cost. The whole machine is divided into two parts: the upper body and the lower frame (connected when in use, and folded for storage when not in use). It weighs about ten catties. Except for the scutching knife, which uses a small iron plate, and the slot, which uses lead wire or bamboo strips, the rest of the machine parts are made of wood.

This machine is most suitable for scutching fresh ramie. Before scutching, the depth of the scutching knife and the width of the slot should be adjusted according to the thickness of the ramie bark in each season. After the machine is placed, spread the ramie bark flat on the scutching frame, generally to a thickness of four to five inches. The roots of the ramie bark should face the slot, with a distance of about three to four inches between the slot and the roots of the ramie bark (that is, placed on the first horizontal wood under the slot). After the ramie bark is placed, it can be scutched.

When scutching, hold the ramie knife pressing plate with your left hand, and pull the ramie with your right hand. The force of both hands should be balanced, and you should grip tightly and pull quickly. After scutching the middle part of the ramie bark, you can immediately scutch the top and tail ends. When scutching the top and tail ends, shake your hand to spread the ramie, and it can be cleaned after scutching once or twice. (Attached picture)

    五九—一型刮麻机
    湖北省商业厅和阳新县商业局共同研究创制成一种五九—一型手压式苎麻刮麻机。这种刮麻机生产效率高，一人操作，每天可刮麻二十余斤（干麻），比用旧式麻刀刮麻效率高五倍到十倍。刮出来的麻成片整齐，一百斤麻皮可减少八斤损耗。这种机器构造简单，造价便宜，全机分为上身、下架两个部分（用时连接在一起，不用则可折起来分置），重约十斤，整个机子除了麻刀用小铁板，槽口用铅丝或竹片外，其余机件都是用木料做的。
    这个机子最适于刮鲜麻。刮麻前，要依据各季麻皮的薄厚调整刮刀的深浅与槽口的宽窄。机子安放好后，将麻皮平散放在刮麻架上，一般以放四、五寸厚为宜，将麻皮根部朝向槽口，槽口与麻皮根部之间的距离约三、四寸长（就是放在槽口下第一个横木上），将麻皮置放好后，就可以刮制。
    刮麻时，用左手握麻刀压板，右手拉麻，两手用力要均衡，并要紧握快拉。将麻皮腰部刮完后，可紧接着刮头、尾麻。刮头、尾麻时，用手一甩将麻散开，这样刮制一、二次就可以刮净。（附图片）
