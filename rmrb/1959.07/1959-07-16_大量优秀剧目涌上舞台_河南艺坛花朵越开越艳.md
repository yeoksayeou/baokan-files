A Large Number of Excellent Plays Emerge on the Stage
Henan's Art Scene Blooms Ever More Beautifully

(Our Dispatch) The flowers of Henan Province's opera art are blooming ever more beautifully, with a large number of new and excellent plays emerging on the stage. From mid-June to early July, each special district and Zhengzhou City held opera observation and performance meetings one after another, demonstrating the tremendous achievements made in opera work since the Great Leap Forward.

Participating in the observation and performance meetings of each special district and Zhengzhou City were: Henan Opera (Yu Opera), Henan Local Opera (Qu Opera), Yue Opera, Peking Opera (Jing Opera), Han Opera, Jingbang Opera, Wanbang Opera, Huaibang Opera, Daping Diao, Siping Diao, Da Xianxi, Erjiaxian, Zhui Zi, Liu Qin, Tao Qing, and Flower Drum, a total of eighteen opera genres, one hundred and fifty-two opera troupes, performing one hundred and eighty-five plays, including original, adapted, and reorganized works.

The prominent features of this performance were: In terms of plays, not only has the quantity of original works increased, but the quality of many has also broken through the general level; most of these are singing the praises of the Great Leap Forward and recalling revolutionary history. These plays have clear themes, tight stories, and pay attention not only to the development of the drama's plot but also to the depiction of typical environments and typical characters, with high ideological content, artistry, and a strong flavor of life. In the adaptation and reorganization of traditional plays, while emphasizing the plays' ideological content, attention has also begun to be paid to the breadth of the genre, as well as the excavation and preservation of some unique arias and tunes. Therefore, the program of the performance was extremely rich and colorful. Among the modern dramas, there are large-scale dramas depicting the lives and qualities of workers, such as "Love Song of the Coal City" and "Toward Show Li"; there are those depicting new people and new things in the Great Leap Forward in rural areas, such as "Bamboo and Rattan Flower," "Nine Sisters," "Mother-in-law and Daughter-in-law Delivering Manure," and "Autumn Field Silver Sea"; there are those depicting combat heroes, such as "Huang Jiguang"; and there are those performing the history of revolutionary struggle, such as "The Long March" and "Battle Until Dawn." In the reorganized traditional plays, attention has also been paid to the excavation and reorganization of valuable plays from various dynasties. Moreover, these plays are diverse in form, including serious dramas, comedies, satirical dramas, and song and dance dramas, demonstrating various different styles.

What is particularly gratifying is that the new force has grown rapidly. Students who only started learning opera a year or two ago have now mastered basic skills and have taken on important roles in performances. For example, Dong Xiujuan, a Qu Opera student from Zhengzhou City Opera School, who has been studying for two years and is only seventeen years old this year, played Chen Sanliang in the play "Chen Sanliang Climbing the Hall," profoundly portraying her complex mood of anger and sorrow.

### 大量优秀剧目涌上舞台  河南艺坛花朵越开越艳

    大量优秀剧目涌上舞台
    河南艺坛花朵越开越艳
    本报讯　河南省戏曲艺术的花朵越开越艳，大量新的优秀剧目涌上舞台。自6月中旬至7月初各专区和郑州市先后举行了戏曲观摩会演，显示了戏曲工作自大跃进以来所取得的巨大成就。
    参加各专区和郑州市观摩会演的有：豫剧、曲剧、越调、京剧、汉剧、京梆、宛梆、怀梆、大平调、四平调、大弦戏、二夹弦、坠子、柳琴、道情、花鼓十八个剧种，一百五十二个剧团，演出了创作、改编和整理的各种剧目一百八十五个。
    这次会演的显著特点是：表现在剧目上，不仅创作的数量增多了，而且在质量上有很多也突破了一般的水平；其中又大多是歌唱大跃进和回忆革命历史的。这些剧目主题鲜明，故事紧凑，既注意到戏剧情节的发展，又注意到典型环境、典型人物的刻划，有较高的思想性、艺术性和浓厚的生活气息。在传统戏的改编整理上，在重视剧目的思想性的同时，也开始注意到体裁的广泛，以及对一些独特的唱腔、曲调的发掘和保存。因此，会演的节目极为丰富多采。在现代戏中，有表现工人生活和工人品质的大型剧，如“煤城恋歌”、“向秀丽”等；有表现农村大跃进中的新人新事的，如“竹藤之花”、“九姊妹”、“婆媳送粪”、“秋田银海”等；有描写战斗英雄的，如“黄继光”；有表演革命斗争历史的，如“长征”、“战斗到拂晓”等。在整理的传统戏中，也注意到各个朝代有价值的剧目的挖掘和整理。而且这些戏形式多样，有正剧、喜剧、讽刺剧、歌舞剧等，表现了各种不同的风格。
    特别可喜的是新生的力量有了迅速的成长，一二年前才刚刚开始学戏的学员，现在已掌握了基本的技巧，在演出中担任了重要的角色。如郑州市戏校曲剧学生董秀娟，学习了二年，今年仅十七岁，在“陈三两爬堂”一剧中饰演陈三两，深刻地刻划了她的愤怒而悲痛的复杂心情。
