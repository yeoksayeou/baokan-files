Comrade Ambassador! Comrades, friends!

Today is the eve of the 15th anniversary of the National Day of the People's Republic of Poland, and all circles in our capital are holding a grand gathering here to celebrate this glorious festival. Please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, to extend my warmest congratulations to the Polish government and the Polish people.

The modern history of Poland is a history of the Polish people's long and heroic struggle for national and social liberation. During the Second World War, the Polish people, with their glorious revolutionary traditions, under the correct leadership of the Polish Workers' Party, correctly combined the national liberation struggle against the fascist German occupation with the struggle to overthrow the rule of the domestic landlords and bourgeoisie, and finally achieved a great victory with the help of the powerful Soviet Union. As everyone knows, in the autumn of 1939, Poland suffered the barbaric invasion of fascist Germany, and the Polish landlord and bourgeois government, which implemented anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and anti-people policies, abandoned the Polish people who were in dire straits and fled in dismay to London for refuge. However, the heroic Polish people and Polish communists did not succumb to the enemy. They valiantly resisted the invading Hitler bandits and dealt them relentless blows. In early 1942, the Polish Workers' Party led the Polish people to wage armed struggle as soon as it was established, and formed the People's Guard, which brought the Polish struggle for independence and social liberation into a new stage. In March 1943, Polish communists and patriots residing in the Soviet Union also formed the Union of Polish Patriots and, with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, established volunteer divisions to fight resolutely for the liberation of their motherland in coordination with the Soviet army. On July 22, 1944, the government truly representing the Polish people—the Polish Committee of National Liberation—was proclaimed in Chelm, the first piece of Polish territory liberated by the Soviet and Polish armies, and issued the famous Lublin Manifesto. Since then, the Polish people have ended their enslaved status, freed themselves from the shackles of landlords and capitalists, and embarked on the broad road of socialist construction.

Before liberation, Poland was an economically backward agricultural country. Industry accounted for only 47% of the total industrial and agricultural output value, and it was mainly light industry. During the twenty years of landlord and bourgeois rule, the Polish economy stagnated. Under the cruel exploitation of landlords and domestic and foreign capitalists, the people's lives were very poor. About a quarter of the workers and eight million peasants in the country were in a miserable situation of unemployment and starvation. Hitler's invasion brought endless disasters to the Polish people, destroying nearly 40% of the country's national wealth and taking the lives of one-fifth of the population. At the beginning of liberation, the country was truly scarred and riddled with bullet holes. However, the heroic Polish people, under the leadership of the Polish Workers' Party and later the Polish United Workers' Party, with the help of the Soviet Union, on the one hand, quickly implemented land reform, distributing the land of the landlords to peasants who had no or little land; and implemented the nationalization of basic national economic sectors, forever ending the enslavement and exploitation of domestic and foreign capitalists. On the other hand, the Polish people, with selfless labor and strong perseverance, and with the world-renowned "Warsaw speed," overcame numerous difficulties on the road ahead and rebuilt their motherland on the ruins of war. In the past fifteen years, People's Poland has not only healed the wounds of war, but has also leaped from a backward agricultural country to an industrial and agricultural country with advanced socialist industry. By 1958, Poland's industrial output was 6.24 times that of pre-war 1938, and the socialist component accounted for more than 99% of the country's industry. Many unprecedented industrial sectors have been established, and brand-new industrial enterprises have been built in many areas that had no industry in the past. The rapid development of Polish industry eloquently proves the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. After liberation, the face of the Polish countryside has also undergone fundamental changes. As a result of the land reform, the economy of the landlords was eliminated. The socialist economy in the countryside—state farms and agricultural production cooperatives—is developing day by day. Total agricultural output value has increased by 19% compared with pre-war levels, and by 41% per capita. With the development of industrial and agricultural construction, the people's material welfare and living standards have also been greatly improved. The era of unemployment and starvation is gone forever. The Polish people now consume an average of 55 kilograms of meat, 288 liters of milk, 28.8 kilograms of sugar, and 21.9 meters of cotton and wool fabrics per person per year. In People's Poland, illiteracy has long been eliminated, basic education has been universalized, and currently 98% of children and adolescents are in school. The number of students in universities and colleges has also increased significantly, and all schools have opened their doors to the children of workers and peasants. All these things that the working people in the old society could not have dreamed of have become a living reality in People's Poland.

In recent years, the Polish people have encountered some difficulties on the road forward. However, the Polish United Workers' Party, headed by Comrade Gomulka, corrected the shortcomings of dogmatism that was divorced from the masses and divorced from reality, united the party ranks and the people of the whole country, resolutely repelled the attacks of the reactionaries who attempted to use the difficulties to undermine the people's democratic system, combated revisionism that threatened the socialist system, and overcame the difficulties on the road forward, thereby continuing to push forward the great cause of socialist construction.

In March of this year, the Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party adopted the guidelines for the development of the national economy from 1959 to 1965. The main guideline of this instruction is to further realize the country's socialist industrialization, gradually carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture, and raise the socialist consciousness of the masses. This instruction showed the Polish people a bright prospect for the further development of socialist construction in Poland. It stipulates that in the next seven years, by 1965, industrial production will increase by 80%, agricultural production will increase by about 30%, the material living standards of urban and rural people will increase by 35%, and the output of some important industrial products such as coal will increase to 113 million tons, steel to 9 million tons, and power generation to 44.5 billion kilowatt-hours. The realization of the Seven-Year Plan will not only enable Poland to continue to leap forward in socialist construction, but also means that the Polish people will make outstanding contributions to the peaceful competition between the socialist system and the capitalist system. At present, the Polish people are inspired by the Party's Seven-Year Plan and are confidently moving towards greater victories.

People's Poland is an important member of the great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. It unswervingly implements the policy of alliance with the Soviet Union and unity and cooperation with other socialist countries. It regards the unity of the socialist camp as a guarantee for its own independence, security, and the victory of socialist construction. It struggles against modern revisionism and all other phenomena that undermine and weaken this unity, and constantly makes active contributions to enhancing this unity.

People's Poland has consistently pursued a foreign policy of peace and is loyal to the noble cause of international peace and human progress. In order to ease international tensions and maintain peace and security in Europe, Poland has put forward many positive initiatives. The famous Rapacki Plan has been deeply supported and welcomed by many peace-loving countries and people. Poland has also consistently adopted a positive attitude towards all peace initiatives of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. Although Poland is thousands of miles away from the Far East, the peace-loving Polish people attach great importance to peace and security in the Far East. For a long time, it has been making all practical efforts to maintain peace in Korea and Indochina. All the contributions that People's Poland has made to peace have won the due respect of the people of all countries.

Dear Polish comrades and friends, today we gather here to warmly celebrate the 15th anniversary of the National Day of Poland, and to congratulate the Polish people on the historic achievements they have made in the great cause of socialist construction and the maintenance of peace in the past fifteen years. We are encouraged and inspired by the achievements of the Polish people, because the achievements of the Polish people are also our achievements, just as our achievements are also the achievements of the Polish people. This brotherly friendship between our two peoples has deep roots, which lie in our common ideology—Marxism-Leninism, and our common goal—peace and socialism. This brotherly friendship between our two peoples did not begin today. It existed long ago during the revolutionary struggles of our two peoples for liberation. We have been concerned about the victory of each other's revolutionary struggles. We were overjoyed by the establishment of the Polish Committee of National Liberation, and you cheered for the victory of the Chinese people's revolution. After the establishment of the people's regimes in the two countries, the inherent brotherly friendship between the two peoples has been continuously deepened through the cooperation and mutual assistance between the parties and the two countries. Today we can say with great satisfaction that in the past ten years, the cooperation and mutual assistance between our two countries has been developing and strengthening comprehensively, systematically, and rapidly. Whether in maintaining international peace, in defending the security and territorial integrity of our own countries, or in socialist construction, we support and help each other. We firmly believe that this brotherly friendship between our two peoples will be as long as the earth and as glorious as the sun. Let us shout:

Long live the People's Republic of Poland!

Long live the Polish United Workers' Party, the leading force of the Polish people!

Long live the eternal and unbreakable brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Polish people!

Long live the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live world peace!

    热烈祝贺波兰人民的辉煌成就
    陈毅副总理在首都庆祝波兰国庆大会上的讲话亲爱的大使同志！同志们，朋友们！
    今天是波兰人民共和国国庆十五周年的前夕，我们首都各界在这里举行隆重的集会，庆祝这个光辉的节日。请允许我以中国政府和中国人民的名义，向波兰政府和波兰人民致以最热烈的祝贺。
    波兰近代的历史，是一部波兰人民为争取民族解放和社会解放而长期英勇斗争的历史。在第二次大战期间，具有光荣革命传统的波兰人民，在波兰工人党的正确领导下，将反对法西斯德国占领的民族解放斗争和推翻本国地主资产阶级统治的斗争正确地结合起来并终于在强大苏联的帮助下取得了伟大的胜利。大家知道，1939年秋天，波兰遭到了法西斯德国的野蛮侵略，执行反苏反共反人民政策的波兰地主资产阶级政府抛弃了处在水深火热中的波兰人民，狼狈逃往伦敦避难。但是英雄的波兰人民和波兰共产主义者并没有向敌人屈服，他们英勇地抗击入侵的希特勒匪徒，给敌人以无情的打击。1942年初，波兰工人党一成立就领导波兰人民进行武装斗争，并组成了人民近卫军，使波兰争取独立和社会解放的斗争进入了一个新的阶段。1943年3月，侨居苏联的波兰共产党人和爱国者，也成立了波兰爱国者联盟并在苏联的无私帮助下建立了志愿军师团，配合苏联军队，为祖国解放而进行了坚决的斗争。1944年7月22日，真正波兰人民的政府——波兰民族解放委员会在苏、波军队解放了的第一块波兰国土海尔姆城宣告成立并发表了著名的卢布林宣言。从此，波兰人民结束了被奴役的地位，摆脱了地主和资本家的枷锁，走上了社会主义建设的康庄大道。
    解放前，波兰原是一个经济落后的农业国家，在工农业总产值中工业只占47％，而且主要是轻工业。在地主资产阶级统治的二十年间，波兰经济一直停滞不前，在地主和国内外资本家的残酷剥削下，人民生活非常贫困，全国约有四分之一的工人和八百万农民处于失业挨饿的悲惨境地。希特勒的侵略更给波兰人民带来了无穷的灾难，全国将近十分之四的国民财富被毁，五分之一的人丧失了生命。解放之初，真是疮痍满目，弹痕遍地。但是，英勇的波兰人民，在波兰工人党和以后的波兰统一工人党的领导下，在苏联的帮助下，一方面迅速实行土地改革，将地主的土地分给无地和少地的农民；实行基本国民经济部门国有化，永远结束了本国和外国资本家的奴役和剥削。另一方面，波兰人民以忘我的劳动和坚强的毅力，以举世闻名的“华沙速度”，克服了前进道路上的重重困难，在战争废墟上重建自己的祖国。十五年来，人民波兰不仅治好了战争的创伤，而且由落后的农业国一跃而成为具有先进的社会主义工业的工农业国家。到1958年，波兰工业产量已经相当于战前1938年的六点二四倍，全国工业中社会主义成分占99％以上。许多前所未有的工业部门建立起来了，许多过去没有工业的地区建设了崭新的工业企业。波兰工业的迅速发展，雄辩地证明了社会主义制度的无比优越性。解放后，波兰农村的面貌也发生了根本的变化，由于实行土地改革的结果，地主的经济被消灭了。农村社会主义经济——国营农场和农业生产合作社一天一天发展起来。农业总产值比战前增加了19％，按人口平均计算则增加了41％。随着工农业建设的发展，人民的物质福利和生活水平也有了巨大的改善。失业和挨饿的时代已一去不复返了。波兰人民现在每年每人平均消费肉类五十五公斤，牛奶二百八十八公升，糖二十八点八公斤，棉毛织品二十一点九公尺。在人民波兰文盲早已消灭，基础教育已经普及，目前有98％的少年儿童在学校读书，在高等学校里学生的人数也有很大增加，一切学校都为工农子弟打开了大门。所有这些在旧社会劳动人民所梦想不到的东西，在人民波兰都已成为活生生的现实了。
    最近几年来，波兰人民在前进的道路上曾经遇到一些困难。但是，以哥穆尔卡同志为首的波兰统一工人党纠正了脱离群众脱离实际的教条主义的缺点，团结了党的队伍和全国人民，坚决击退了妄图利用困难破坏人民民主制度的反动派的进攻，打击了威胁社会主义制度的修正主义，克服了前进道路上的困难，从而把社会主义建设的伟大事业继续推向前进。
    今年3月，波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会通过了1959—1965年发展国民经济的指示。这个指示的主要方针是进一步实现国家社会主义工业化，逐步进行农业的社会主义改造，提高群众的社会主义觉悟。这个指示向波兰人民展示了波兰社会主义建设进一步发展的美好远景。它规定在今后七年内，到1965年工业生产将增长80％，农业生产约增加30％，城乡人民的物质生活水平将提高35％，一些重要的工业产品如煤的产量将增至一亿一千三百万吨，钢增至九百万吨，发电量增至四百四十五亿度。七年计划的实现，不仅将使波兰在社会主义建设上继续跃进一大步，同时也意味着波兰人民在社会主义体系对资本主义体系的和平竞赛中将要作出卓越的贡献。目前波兰人民正为党的七年计划所鼓舞，满怀信心地向着更大的胜利前进。
    人民波兰是以苏联为首的伟大的社会主义阵营的重要一员。它坚定不移地执行着同苏联同盟、同其他社会主义国家团结合作的政策，它把社会主义阵营的团结看作是自己独立、安全和社会主义建设胜利的保证，它同破坏和削弱这种团结的现代修正主义及其他一切现象进行斗争，不断地为增强这种团结而作出积极的贡献。
    人民波兰一贯地执行着和平外交政策，忠实于国际和平和人类进步的崇高事业。为了和缓国际紧张局势和维护欧洲的和平和安全，波兰曾经提出了不少的积极的倡议，著名的腊帕茨基计划，深受许多爱好和平的国家和人民的支持和欢迎。波兰对于苏联和其他社会主义国家的一切和平倡议也一贯采取积极支持的态度。尽管波兰和远东相距万里，但是爱好和平的波兰人民对于远东的和平和安全赋予了重大的关心。长期以来，为维护朝鲜和印度支那的和平已经并正在作出一切实际的努力。人民波兰为和平所作的一切贡献，赢得了各国人民应有的尊敬。
    亲爱的波兰同志们和朋友们，今天我们在此集会，热烈祝贺波兰国庆十五周年，祝贺波兰人民十五年来在社会主义建设和维护和平的伟大事业中所获得的历史性成就。我们为波兰人民获得这些成就而欢欣鼓舞，因为波兰人民的成就也就是我们的成就，正如我们的成就也就是波兰人民的成就一样。我们两国人民间的这种休戚相关的兄弟友谊是有着深刻的根源的，这种根源在于我们有着共同的思想——马克思列宁主义，共同的奋斗目标——和平和社会主义，我们两国人民间的这种兄弟友谊也不是今天才有的，远在我们两国人民争取解放的革命斗争时期就存在着。我们曾经相互关心着彼此革命斗争的胜利，我们曾经为波兰民族解放委员会的成立兴高采烈，你们也曾为中国人民革命的胜利而欢呼雀跃。在两国人民政权建立以后，两国人民固有的兄弟友谊便通过两国党和两个国家之间的合作互助而不断地加深。今天我们可以十分满意地说，十年来，我们两国的合作互助是在全面地有系统地迅速地发展着和加强着，无论在维护国际和平方面，在保卫自己祖国的安全和领土完整方面，或者在社会主义建设方面，我们都是互相支持和互相帮助的。我们深信我们两国人民间的这种兄弟友谊将和地球一样的长久，和太阳一样的光辉。让我们高呼：
    波兰人民共和国万岁！
    波兰人民的领导力量——波兰统一工人党万岁！
    中波两国人民永恒的牢不可破的兄弟友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
