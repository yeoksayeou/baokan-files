    Resolutely Support the Just Struggle of the Vietnamese People
    Yang Xiufeng, President of the Sino-Vietnamese Friendship Association

    July 20th marks the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Geneva Accords. The signing of the Geneva Accords ended the eight-year Indochina War and realized peace in Indochina. This was a great victory for the heroic struggle of the Indochinese people.

    For the past five years, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently worked to implement the Geneva Accords, not only actively proposing negotiations between the North and South on the issue of unification, but also repeatedly suggesting discussions on mutual disarmament, trade, and allowing cultural and scientific groups, women, and children to visit relatives, and free communication. However, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in South Vietnam, instigated by the United States, brazenly and unreasonably rejected these series of reasonable proposals, causing the Vietnamese people to suffer the long-term pain of national division and separation from their families.

    The Geneva Accords clearly stipulate that all reinforcements and new military personnel are prohibited from entering Vietnam. However, the United States has continuously expanded its military advisory group in South Vietnam and constantly sent other military personnel to South Vietnam, increasing the number of American military personnel in South Vietnam more than tenfold compared to before the ceasefire.

    The Geneva Accords stipulate that it is forbidden to provide Vietnam with reinforcements of various types of weapons, ammunition, and other combat materials. However, the United States illegally shipped large quantities of weapons and combat materials to South Vietnam. They continuously transported hundreds of thousands of tons of American weapons and war materials to South Vietnam by ships and planes.

    The Geneva Accords stipulate that it is forbidden to establish new military bases in Vietnam and that no foreign military bases may be established. However, in recent years, the United States has not only expanded many existing military bases in South Vietnam but also opened up and established many new military bases.

    The Geneva Accords stipulate that there should be no retaliation or discrimination against former resistance personnel, their families, and related organizations, and that their democratic freedoms should be guaranteed. However, the US-Ngo clique used blood-stained hands to destroy this clause, intensifying its fascist terror rule, massively killing, harming, and arresting former resistance personnel and the families of personnel who regrouped to the North; and formulated various decrees and regulations to stifle freedom and democratic rights, widely establishing Hitler-style concentration camps to persecute former resistance personnel and patriots; in addition, they also established fifty so-called "reclamation areas," forcing former resistance personnel to engage in various kinds of hard labor; the shocking massacre of one thousand Vietnamese patriots by poisoning at the Phu Loi concentration camp last December is an appalling blood debt!

    These criminal activities of the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in South Vietnam are part of the American conspiracy to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Vietnam, undermine peace in Indochina, and create tension in Southeast Asia. It attempts to use this to intimidate the Vietnamese people who are striving for peaceful reunification and complete independence of their motherland, and to pave the way for the United States to further control South Vietnam and drag South Vietnam into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc. At the same time, the United States is using South Vietnam and Thailand as bases to intensify its aggression, undermine Cambodia's peaceful neutrality, and create civil war in Laos, threatening the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. These criminal activities of the United States have already created a serious threat to peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia, making the situation in this region tense. The Vietnamese people and the people of the Indochinese countries are struggling to maintain their independence and sovereignty and oppose foreign interference. All peace-loving and free countries and peoples in Southeast Asia will never allow the US imperialists' conspiracy to occupy Indochina to succeed.

    The Chinese people have suffered greatly from imperialist aggression. At present, US imperialism still occupies our territory of Taiwan and continuously violates our territorial waters and airspace. The purpose of the United States in undermining the Geneva Accords and carrying out various criminal activities in Indochina is also to threaten our country's security. Dulles once blatantly said: "The United States is carrying out activities against China on three fronts: Taiwan, Korea, and Indochina." The Chinese and Vietnamese peoples have consistent interests and have a traditional friendship that is as close as brothers, sharing weal and woe and common security. As the faithful brothers and friends of the Vietnamese people and a participant in the Geneva Conference, the Chinese people warmly respond to the call of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council to designate July 20th as "Vietnam Day," and resolutely support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people for the peaceful reunification of their motherland. The Chinese people will, together with peace-loving people of all countries, resolutely demand an immediate end to American interference and aggression in Indochina and demand that American aggressive forces withdraw from South Vietnam. We believe that the Geneva Accords must be thoroughly implemented, the peaceful reunification of Vietnam must be realized, and peace in Indochina must be guaranteed.

    坚决支持越南人民的正义斗争
    中国越南友好协会会长　杨秀峰
    7月20日是日内瓦协议签订五周年纪念日。日内瓦协议的签订，结束了历时八年的印度支那战争，实现了印度支那的和平。这是印度支那人民英勇斗争的伟大胜利。
    五年来越南民主共和国一贯为实施日内瓦协议而努力，不仅积极建议北、南双方就统一问题举行谈判，而且还一再建议商讨双方共同裁军、互通贸易以及允许文化科学等团体和妇女儿童来往参观探亲、自由通讯等问题。但是南越吴庭艳集团在美国唆使下，悍然无理的拒绝了这一系列的合理建议，使越南人民长期遭受着祖国分裂和亲属隔离的痛苦。
    日内瓦协议明文规定：禁止一切增援部队和新增的军事人员进入越南。但是美国却不断扩大它在南越的军事顾问团，并不断派遣其他军事人员到南越使美国在南越的军事人员已比停战前增加了十倍以上。
    日内瓦协议规定，禁止向越南增援各种类型的武器、弹药和其他一切作战物资。但美国却非法向南越运入大量武器和作战物资。他们不断以轮船和飞机把大量的数以十万吨以上的美国武器和战争物资输送入南越。
    日内瓦协议规定：禁止在越南境内建立新的军事基地及不得建立属于外国的任何军事基地。然而，美国几年来在南越不仅扩充了许多原有的军事基地，而且开辟和建立了许多新的军事基地。
    日内瓦协议规定：不得对前抗战人员及其家属和有关团体加以报复和歧视，并保障其民主自由。但是美吴集团却用沾满鲜血的双手破坏了这个条款，加紧法西斯恐怖统治，大规模杀戮、残害和逮捕前抗战人员和集结到北方人员的家属；并且制定了各种各样扼杀自由民主权利的法令和条例，广设希特勒式的集中营，用来迫害前抗战人员和爱国者；此外，还设立了五十个所谓“垦荒区”，迫使前抗战人员从事各种苦役；去年12月富利集中营骇人听闻的下毒杀害一千名越南爱国者的惨案，更是一笔令人发指的大血债！
    美国和吴庭艳集团在南越这些罪恶活动，是美国阻挠越南恢复和平统一，破坏印度支那和平及在东南亚制造紧张局势的侵略阴谋的一部分。它企图以此来吓倒争取祖国和平统一和完全独立的越南人民，并为美国进一步控制南越，把南越拉入东南亚侵略集团铺平道路。同时，美国正以南越和泰国作为基地，加紧侵略活动，破坏柬埔寨的和平中立，并在老挝制造内战，威胁越南民主共和国。美国的这些罪恶活动，已经造成对印度支那和东南亚和平的严重威胁，使这个地区的局势紧张起来。越南人民和印度支那各国人民正在为维护独立主权和反对外国干涉进行斗争。东南亚一切爱好和平和自由的国家和人民，决不容许美帝国主义者霸占印度支那的阴谋得逞。
    中国人民曾备受帝国主义侵略之苦，目前美帝国主义还霸占着我国领土台湾，并不断侵犯我国领海和领空。美国破坏日内瓦协议和在印度支那所进行的各种罪恶活动，其目的之一也是要威胁我国的安全。杜勒斯曾经露骨地说过：“美国在台湾、朝鲜和印度支那这三个阵线上进行反对中国的活动”。中越两国人民利害一致，有着亲如手足、休戚相关、安危与共的传统友谊，作为越南人民的忠实兄弟和朋友以及日内瓦会议的参加国，中国人民热烈响应亚非人民团结理事会关于把7月20日定为“越南日”的号召，坚决支持越南人民争取祖国和平统一的正义斗争。中国人民将同各国爱好和平人民一道，坚决要求立即制止美国在印度支那的干涉和侵略活动，要求美国侵略势力撤出南越。我们认为，日内瓦协议必须得到彻底的实施，越南的和平统一必须得到实现，印度支那和平必须得到保障。
