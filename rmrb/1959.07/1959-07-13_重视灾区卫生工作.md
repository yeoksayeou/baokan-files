Emphasis on hygiene work in disaster areas

This year, southern regions like Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Fujian provinces and autonomous regions have all suffered from flood disasters. Under the leadership and support of the Party and the People's Government, the local people have overcome the dangers of the floods and are working hard to restore production and rush to plant late autumn crops. The severely affected areas must rebuild their homes through production self-reliance. We wish them victory in restoring production.

However, the floods can bring various health hazards. Infectious disease bacteria often take advantage of hot weather, unsanitary conditions, and accumulated water to breed rapidly in the bodies of vectors such as mosquitoes, flies, rats, and insects. To protect the health of the main labor force and prevent them from suffering serious diseases after the flood, it is necessary to emphasize and seize the hygiene and epidemic prevention work in the affected areas. For example, removing garbage that easily breeds mosquitoes, flies, rats, and other vectors, dredging ditches, draining accumulated water, building toilets, etc., to improve environmental sanitation. And in the process of removing garbage, combine it with accumulating fertilizer, so that sanitation work is closely integrated with the restoration of production. At present, Dongguan County, Guangdong Province, has vigorously launched sanitation work, and other disaster-stricken areas must also pay full attention and seize the opportunity in time.

    重视灾区卫生工作
    今年南方各地，如广东、广西、江西、湖北、福建等省、区，都遭受到洪水灾害的袭击。当地人民在党和人民政府的领导和支援下，战胜了洪水的危害，正在努力恢复生产，抢种晚秋作物；重灾区要在生产自救下，重建家园。我们预祝他们在恢复生产中得到胜利。
    但是，洪水的袭击，会给我们带来各种危害健康的疾病。那些传染疾病的细菌，往往乘着天气炎热、环境肮脏、积水等机会，在传染媒介的蚊蝇鼠虫等身上得到大量繁殖。为了保障生产主力的劳动大军的健康，不让他们在洪水袭击之后再受到严重疾病的危害，就要重视和抓紧受灾区的卫生防疫工作。例如，清除容易孳生蚊蝇鼠虫等传染媒介的垃圾，疏通沟渠，排除积水，修建厕所，等等，搞好环境卫生。并在清除垃圾等过程中，结合积肥，使卫生工作同恢复生产密切结合起来。现在，广东省东莞县已经大力开展了卫生工作，其它受灾地区也要充分重视，及时抓紧。
