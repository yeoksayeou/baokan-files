Thrilling and Innovative

    Recently, the Wuhan Acrobatic Troupe presented their programs intended as a gift for the 10th anniversary of the National Day in two early performances, each time exciting the audience. Although they performed traditional programs such as "Plate Spinning," "Rola Bola," "Chair Balancing," and "Collective Bicycle Stunts," these traditional programs were enriched in content and the skills reached a new level after processing and reorganization. Their performances became more thrilling and suspenseful.

    Double Flying Swallows on Five Layers of Benches

    The most attractive is Xia Juhua's newly practiced "Plate Spinning" stunt - called "Double Layer Double Flying Swallows plus Crutch Stand." This actress, who won a gold medal at the 6th World Youth Festival, strings together the various actions of "Plate Spinning" through the plot of a brother and sister playing games at home, performing from the stage to the benches, then to the square table, and developing higher and higher. Finally, the stagehands stand on other people's shoulders and place seven five-layer benches on the square table, four of which are suspended and extended to both sides, forming two layers of "swallow's wings." Xia Juhua, with twelve porcelain bowls on her head, supports herself with two wooden sticks (crutches) to stand on top of them, bending her chest and abdomen backwards, and slowly hanging her legs from behind her neck to her shoulders, forming a "yuanbao stand."

    According to comrades from the acrobatic troupe, when she performed "Plate Spinning" at the World Youth Festival in Moscow in 1956, she only performed some actions on benches and tables. Later, she improved her skills and practiced "Single Layer Double Flying Swallows," which was well received at home and abroad. This stunt she performed this time began to be practiced at the end of February this year. The difficulty of this action is: it is very unstable to stand on "crutches" on the ground, but she stands on "crutches" at this height with eight unstable joints (bench feet against feet), and the benches sway in all directions, making it more difficult to maintain balance.

    In order to master this technique, Xia Juhua started practicing at four o'clock every morning, practicing for more than ten hours a day without interruption. At first, the benches fell down as soon as they were set up, let alone having people stand on them. In this way, despite being tied with safety ropes, she inevitably suffered minor falls and bumps during rehearsals, but she got up and immediately continued practicing. In addition, this twenty-one-year-old girl has been learning acrobatics since she was six years old and has a good foundation, so she quickly mastered this stunt in more than four months with the care of the Party organization.

    Three Layers of Benches, Three Layers of People

    Also thrilling is the "Rola Bola" performed by Lan Xia and others. This program was originally best performed by the China Acrobatic Troupe. They once performed the actions of three layers of people without benches, two layers of benches and two layers of people, and three layers of benches and one person at the World Youth Festival, winning a silver medal. This time, the Wuhan Acrobatic Troupe performed three layers of benches and three layers of people, with the person at the top standing on someone else's head, and five people forming a "paifang" with three layers of benches.

    In this performance, the most demanding part is Lan Xia, the actor at the bottom. He is an old performer with thirty years of experience, and his waist and leg skills are very strong. He worked hard with four young actors for more than three months and finally found a way to control the rollers and balance the center of gravity.

    "Chair Balancing" Ascends Step by Step

    The "Chair Balancing," which won the first prize in the Wuhan Youth Art Festival, also left a deep impression. They only learned this program from the China Acrobatic Troupe in 1954, and at that time there were only three-person chair balancing. Later, they tried to improve it to a five-person balancing act. They received high praise when they performed in the Soviet Union and Hungary. This time they further improved it to a seven-person balancing act. Just stack the square wooden chairs diagonally layer by layer. When the seventh actor climbs to the top of the high ladder, the stagehands use long poles to deliver the last chair, sometimes not even reaching it. However, these seven actors take turns standing on this string of chairs that stretches diagonally into the sky, forming a row of human ladders in the air, which is extremely spectacular.

    The difficulty of this action lies in the fact that as the number of people and chairs increases, the center of gravity shifts further outward, making it extremely difficult to maintain balance. Yin Yuyun, the actor at the bottom responsible for controlling the balance, is covered in protruding muscles and looks like a "strongman." He told reporters that to rehearse this action, all seven people must be of one mind and one energy. When they practiced the six-person balancing act and added the seventh person, even though it was an eleven-year-old actor weighing only forty or fifty pounds, everyone collapsed as soon as he went up, as if they didn't know the action at all. The reason was that this little guy's skills were not deep enough and he sometimes swayed on top. This is like what is often said in acrobatics: "Four ounces can move a thousand pounds." His slight movement at the top shifts the entire center of gravity, making it impossible to control below. Everyone helped this little actor, who had only been learning for three months, to practice, so that he could do handstands for one or two minutes at a time on the ground, and one or two minutes on the chair, and be able to stand still at the top. Yin Yuyun and the two actors at the bottom also worked together to control the center of gravity, leaning inwards if the center of gravity shifted outwards, and squeezing outwards if the center of gravity shifted inwards.

    In addition, they also made some improvements to the props, appropriately widening the bottom chair so that the angle of the outward shift of the center of gravity would not be too large, making it easier to control.

专栏：惊心动魄  推陈出新

    惊心动魄  推陈出新
    最近，武汉杂技团将他们向国庆十周年献礼的节目，提前作了两次演出，每次都使观众很兴奋。虽然他们演出的还是“顶碗”、“幌板”、“椅子造型”和“集体车技”等传统节目，但是经过加工整理后，这些传统节目便在内容上更加丰富多彩，技艺上升到了新的境界。他们的表演也就更加惊心动魄，扣人心弦。
    五层凳上双飞燕
    最吸引人的是夏菊花新近练成的“顶碗”绝技——名叫“双层双飞燕外加拐子顶”的动作。这个获得六届世界青年联欢节金质奖章的女演员，通过农村姐弟俩在家中游戏的情节，将“顶碗”的各个动作串连起来，由戏台上演到条凳上，再演到方桌上，越演越往高处发展。最后，检场人员就站在别人肩上，将七条五层板凳安上方桌，其中有四条悬空伸向两边，组成两层“燕子的飞翅”。头顶十二个磁碗的夏菊花，手撑着两根木棍（拐子）在这上面起顶，并将胸腹反曲过来，让双腿缓缓地从颈后挂到肩上，形成一个“元宝顶”。
    据杂技团的同志讲，她1956年在莫斯科世界青年联欢节演出“顶碗”时，只表演了凳上、桌上的一些动作。后来，她将技巧提高一步，练成了“单层双飞燕”，在国内外都得到好评。她这次表演的这项绝技，是从今年2月底开始练的。这个动作的难处是：在平地撑着“拐子”起顶都很不平稳，而她却在这个有八个立不稳的接点（板凳脚对脚）的高处起“拐子顶”，凳子向四面八方晃动，更难掌握平衡。
    为了掌握这一技术，夏菊花每天早晨四点钟开始练功，一天练功十小时以上，从不间断。最初，板凳刚架上去就倒了下来，别说人在上面起顶了。这样，尽管他拴有安全绳，也难免在排练中有轻微的跌伤、撞伤，但她爬起来又马上继续练。加上这个二十一岁的姑娘，从六岁开始学杂技，功底好，她很快就在党组织的关怀下，四个多月练成这手绝技。
    三层凳子三层人
    令人惊心动魄的还有蓝侠等人的“幌板”。这个节目本来要数中国杂技团演的最好。他们曾经在世界青年联欢节上表演了不带凳子三层人、两层凳子两层人、三层凳子一个人的动作，获得了银质奖章。武汉杂技团这次却演出了三层凳子三层人，最顶上的人还在别人头上起顶，以及三层凳子五个人组成“牌楼”的动作。
    在这个表演中，最吃功的是最底层的演员蓝侠。他是个有三十年艺龄的老把式，腰功、腿功都挺硬。他同四个年轻的演员一起苦练了三个多月，终于找到控制滚轴、平衡重心的办法。
    “椅子造型”步步高升
    在武汉青年文艺会演中得到一等奖的“椅子造型”，也给人留下了深刻印象。他们1954年才向中国杂技团学习这个节目，当时只有三人椅子造型。后来，他们设法提高为五人造型。他们在苏联和匈牙利演出时，都得到了很高的评价。他们这次又进一步提高为七人椅子造型。只是方形木椅斜着一层一层往上垒，当第七名演员沿着高梯攀上顶处后，检场人员用长竿往上递送最后一把椅子，有时也够不着。但是，这七个演员就在这斜着伸向高空的一串椅子上拿起顶来，悬空组成一排人梯，极为壮观。
    这个动作的难处，在于人和椅子加多后，重心越往外偏，平衡极难掌握。负责控制平衡的最底层的演员尹玉云，浑身都是突起的肌肉，一看就是个“大力士”。他向记者介绍：排练这个动作，必须七人一条心，一股劲。当他们练就六人造型，往上加第七人的时候，尽管增加的是个十一岁的小演员，体重只不过四、五十斤，但他一上去，大家便垮下来了，好像根本不会这个动作似的。原因是这个小家伙的功力不深，有时在上面幌动。这就像杂技中常说的：“四两波千斤。”他在最上层稍微动一下，就使全部的重心移动，下面没法控制。大家就帮助这个学艺才三个来月的小演员练功，使他做到在平地上每次拿大顶一、二十分钟，在椅子上拿大顶一、二分钟，能在最上层坚持不动。尹玉云还和底部的两个演员一起控制重心，如重心朝外偏，三人就往里靠；重心朝里偏，三人就往外挤一挤。
    另外，他们对道具也作了些改进，将最底层的椅子适当加宽，使重心外移的角度不致过大，比较容易控制。
