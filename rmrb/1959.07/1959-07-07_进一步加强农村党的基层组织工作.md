    Further Strengthen the Work of Party Grassroots Organizations in Rural Areas
    Ji Zhaoqing, Minister of Organization Department of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee
    The party's grassroots organizations are the basic link between the party and the broad masses. The party's policies and propositions must be specifically implemented among the masses through them, and the thoughts and demands of the masses must also be specifically reflected through them. Therefore, further strengthening the work of the party's grassroots organizations is of great significance for consolidating the people's communes and developing production. After the rectification of communes and the rectification of the Party and the training of production movements, the core fortress role of the broad rural grassroots party organizations in the masses has been greatly strengthened. The broad masses of rural party members have set an example, leading the masses to work hard and make brilliant achievements in the production movement, further strengthening the ties between the Party and the masses. However, with the development of the situation, the tasks have become more arduous and the demands of the masses have become higher. This requires us to further strengthen the work of the party's grassroots organizations, give play to the due role of party organizations and party members, unite the broad masses, mobilize all positive factors, consolidate and improve the people's communes, and achieve this year's great leap forward.
    First, every rural grassroots party organization is required to humbly listen to the opinions of the masses and correctly implement the party's policies and resolutions. Maintaining close ties with the masses, frequently reporting the opinions and demands of the masses to the higher party organizations, and correctly implementing the party's policies and resolutions is the most important and basic task of grassroots party organizations. To correctly implement the party's policies, we must humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, consult with the masses in handling affairs, and educate the masses with correct methods. We must never be simple, rigid, or coercive. Because any production or work is a matter for the masses themselves, the party's policies and propositions originally represent the interests and demands of the broad masses. As long as the masses truly understand the party's policies and propositions ideologically, they will actively support and consciously act. We should believe that the wisdom and strength of the masses are infinite. Only by concentrating the wisdom and strength of the broad masses and relying closely on the masses can the grassroots party organizations do their work well. When planting rice this year, the Guanghui Production Team of Mulu People's Commune in Nanxian County was planned to lack one-third of its labor force. If a solution was not found, the season would be delayed. The party branch submitted this issue to all team members for discussion, mobilized everyone to come up with ideas and methods, improve labor management, and improve labor efficiency. As a result, not only was the problem of labor shortage completely solved, but also the task of rice transplanting was completed two days ahead of schedule compared to the original plan. Grassroots party organizations must make listening to and reflecting the opinions of the masses a system, frequently collect the opinions and demands of the masses through the active activities of party members, and report them to the party organization in a timely manner; and seize the most concerned and urgent issues of the masses and earnestly solve them. When reflecting the emotions and demands of the masses, we must strive to be truthful and comprehensive, neither exaggerating nor shrinking, so that the higher party organization can grasp the real situation, discover problems in a timely manner, solve problems, and make the work better and supported by the broad masses.
    Secondly, we must fully promote inner-Party democracy and give play to the collective role of grassroots Party organizations. All major issues should be collectively discussed by the committees or all members of the grassroots Party organizations, fully promoting democracy and listening to the opinions of Party members and the masses before decisions are made. Any leader has only a certain amount of ability and cannot surpass the collective wisdom and experience. Neglecting the role of the collective and making arbitrary decisions alone can easily lead to mistakes and cause losses to the work. The strength of collective leadership lies in its reliance on and giving play to the collective role of Party members and the masses. Every Party member of the grassroots organization lives directly among the masses, has close ties with the masses, and is most familiar with the ideological emotions and practical situations in all aspects of the masses. Paying attention to listening to their opinions can make the resolutions of the Party organization more correct and perfect to implement, and at the same time, it can give greater play to the enthusiasm and creativity of Party members. Therefore, rural Party grassroots organizations should often collect the opinions and reflections of Party members through individual talks or meetings. The commune Party committee should convene Party member meetings or Party representative meetings regularly, fully promote democracy, summarize and inspect work, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and invigorate and improve inner-Party democratic life.
    Third, we must frequently educate and help Party members play their due role. Grassroots Party organizations are connected with the broad masses through each Party member. The role of Party members is not only reflected in their ability to play an exemplary role, but more importantly, it is reflected in their ability to maintain close ties with the masses, deeply publicize the Party's policies and resolutions to the masses, frequently reflect the opinions and demands of the masses, mobilize the masses, and actively complete various tasks. Grassroots Party organizations must effectively strengthen the regular management and education of Party members and help Party members continuously improve their ideological awareness and activity ability. We must further improve various systems within the Party. Strictly carry out organizational life, seriously carry out criticism and self-criticism at least once a month, and promptly resolve some problems existing in the ideology and work style of Party members. Consolidate and run rural night Party schools well, and conduct education on basic Party knowledge and the Party's policies and policies at various times in light of the ideological and work situation of Party members in each period. Special attention should be paid to cultivating and educating Party members in practical work, helping them summarize work experience and improve work methods. When assigning work to Party members, we must specifically assign their tasks based on the actual situation of each Party member, and explain the policies and work methods in detail. So that every rural Party member can play their due role in production and work.
    Fourth, we must actively and prudently recruit new Party members and continuously develop and strengthen the Party organization. After the tempering of the rectification movement and the Great Leap Forward, a large number of activists have emerged in rural areas of our province, many of whom already have a certain degree of political awareness and urgently demand to join the Party organization. Timely absorbing those who truly meet the conditions of Party members into the Party is of great importance for strengthening the Party's leadership over the people's communes. Party organizations at all levels should strengthen the leadership of Party building work, make unified deployments and arrangements, promptly supervise and inspect, assign special personnel to manage, and ensure the quality of Party members. At the same time, we must also improve the Party's grassroots organizations and rationally organize Party members according to production units to facilitate the Party's leadership and activities. For production teams with no Party members or only one or two Party members, we must actively select and cultivate activists, earnestly do a good job in Party building work, to strengthen the Party's leadership in these areas.
    Fifth, under the unified leadership of the Party organization, we must give full play to the role of various organizations. The Party's grassroots organizations are the leading core of other grassroots organizations. All work should be carried out under the unified leadership of the Party organization. However, unified leadership must be combined with giving play to the role of various organizations in order to do all work well in an all-round way. The Party's grassroots organizations should strengthen the leadership of the management committee, the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, and other organizations. We must unite these organizations around ourselves and mobilize the broad masses through them to do a good job in various productions and tasks. We must regularly study and discuss the work of various organizations, frequently guide their activities, and in various central tasks, specifically assign tasks according to their characteristics, and require them to do a good job in all aspects of work in combination with the central tasks. In this way, the grassroots Party organization can reduce specific affairs, facilitate concentrating its efforts on studying major issues, doing a good job in political and ideological work, and strengthening the Party's core leadership role.
    Finally, there is another important issue, which is to fully rely on grassroots Party organizations to carry out work. At present, some places have not paid due attention to the issue of relying on grassroots Party organizations to carry out work. They are accustomed to using the method of "one-size-fits-all" meetings to arrange work, and have not paid attention to arranging the activities of grassroots Party organizations and Party members, which affects the enthusiasm of Party members and the full play of the role of Party organizations. In special circumstances, it is necessary to convene more expanded meetings. But it is not appropriate to convene "one-size-fits-all" meetings frequently. Even if it is convened, necessary inner-Party activities should be arranged. Under normal circumstances, for all major issues, we must first have inner-Party discussions and then external discussions, first unifying inner-Party ideological understanding, and then going to the masses to conduct discussions before implementing them. In addition, Party member cadres sent by higher authorities to help with work must carry out work under the unified leadership of the grassroots Party organization. Their task is mainly to be good advisors, cultivate cadres, summarize experience, discover problems, study methods, and help the grassroots Party organization correctly implement the Party's policies and resolutions. And they cannot subjectively take care of everything on their own and simply issue orders. This is not only a matter of working methods, but also a matter of organizational principles. The Party organization should educate and help cadres pay attention to improving the relationship between individuals and the organization, and correctly give play to the due role of individuals and the Party organization. Party organizations at higher levels must pay attention to strengthening the work of Party organizations at the grassroots level, frequently check and summarize, exchange experiences, and help them improve their working methods and continuously improve their leadership level, so as to cultivate and train the Party organizations at the grassroots level into strong fighting fortresses and ensure the smooth realization of the Great Leap Forward in production.

    进一步加强农村党的基层组织工作
    中共湖南省委组织部部长　纪照青
    党的基层组织是党联系广大群众的基本纽带。党的政策主张都要通过它在群众中具体贯彻执行，群众的思想和要求，也要通过它具体反映上来。因此，进一步加强党的基层组织工作，对于巩固人民公社和发展生产，具有十分重要的意义。我省广大农村党的基层组织，经过整社整党和生产运动的锻炼，在群众中的核心堡垒作用大大加强了。广大农村党员以身作则，带领群众苦干实干，在生产运动中作出了辉煌的成绩，进一步密切了党与群众的联系。但是，随着形势的发展，任务更加繁重了，群众的要求也更加高了。这就要求我们进一步加强农村党的基层组织工作，发挥党组织和党员的应有作用，团结广大群众，调动一切积极因素，以巩固提高人民公社，实现今年的大跃进。
    首先，要求每个农村基层党组织，都能虚心听取群众意见，正确贯彻执行党的政策决议。密切联系群众，经常向上级党组织反映群众的意见与要求，正确贯彻执行党的政策决议，这是基层党组织一项最重要最基本的任务。要正确地贯彻执行党的政策，就一定要虚心听取群众意见，和群众商量办事，用正确的方法教育群众，绝不能简单生硬，强迫命令。因为任何生产、工作，都是群众自己的事情，党的政策主张，本来就是代表广大群众的利益与要求的。只要群众从思想上真正了解党的政策主张，他们就会积极拥护，自觉地行动起来。我们应该相信，群众的智慧和力量是无穷的。基层党组织只有善于集中广大群众的智慧和力量，紧紧地依靠群众，才能把工作作好。南县牧鹿公社光辉生产队，在今年插秧的时候，按计划缺少三分之一的劳力，如不设法解决，就会延误季节。党支部便将这个问题提交全队社员讨论，发动大家出主意想办法，改进劳动管理，提高劳动工效。结果，不但缺乏劳力的问题完全得到了解决，而且还比原计划提前两天完成插秧任务。基层党组织必须把听取和反映群众意见形成为一种制度，经常通过党员的积极活动，收集群众的意见与要求，及时向党组织反映；并抓住群众最关心最迫切的问题，认真加以解决。在反映群众情绪和要求的时候，一定要力求真实和全面，既不夸大，也不缩小，使上级党组织能够掌握真实情况，及时发现问题，解决问题，使工作做的更好，为广大群众所拥护。
    其次，要充分发扬党内民主，发挥基层党组织的集体作用。一切重大问题都应该经过基层党组织的委员会或全体党员集体讨论，充分发扬民主，听取党员群众的意见，才能作出决定。任何一个领导者，只具有一定的能力，不可能超过集体的智慧和经验。忽视集体的作用，个人独断专行，就容易犯错误，使工作受到损失。集体领导之所以有力量，就在于它依靠和发挥了党员群众的集体作用。基层组织的每个党员都直接生活在群众之中，他们与群众有着密切的联系，对群众的思想情绪和各方面的实际情况最为熟悉，注意听取他们的意见，就能使党组织的决议，更加正确完善地贯彻执行，同时也能更加发挥党员的积极性和创造性。因此，农村党的基层组织，要经常用个别谈话或召开会议的方式，收集党员的意见和反映。公社党委要定期召开党员大会或党员代表大会，充分发扬民主，总结检查工作，开展批评与自我批评，活跃和健全党内民主生活。
    第三，要经常教育、帮助党员发挥应有的作用。基层党组织是通过每个党员去联系广大群众的。党员的作用，不只是表现在自己能够起模范带头作用，而且更重要的是表现在能够密切联系群众，向群众深入地宣传党的政策和决议，经常反映群众的意见和要求，发动群众，积极完成各项任务。基层党组织要切实加强对党员的经常管理教育工作，帮助党员不断提高思想觉悟和活动能力。要进一步健全党内的各项制度。严格组织生活，每月至少认真开展一次批评与自我批评，及时解决党员思想上、作风上存在的一些问题。巩固和办好农村夜党校，结合每个时期党员的思想和工作情况，进行党的基本知识的教育和各个时期党的方针政策的教育。要特别注意在实际工作中培养教育党员，帮助他们总结工作经验，改进工作方法。在向党员布置工作的时候，要根据各个党员的实际情况，具体分配他们的任务，并且详细交代政策和工作方法。使每个农村党员在生产、工作中都能起到应有的作用。
    第四，要积极慎重地接收新党员，不断发展壮大党的组织。经过整风运动和大跃进的锻炼，我省农村中涌现了大量的积极分子，其中有许多人已经具有一定的政治觉悟，迫切要求加入党的组织。及时地将那些确实具备党员条件的人吸收到党内来，对于加强党对人民公社的领导，有重要的作用。各级党组织应该加强对建党工作的领导，统一部署安排，及时督促检查，确定专人管理，确保党员质量。同时还要健全党的基层组织，按照生产单位把党员合理地组织起来，以便于党的领导和活动。对于没有党员和只有一两个党员的生产队，要积极挑选培养积极分子，认真做好建党工作，以加强党对这些地方的领导。
    第五，要在党组织的统一领导下，充分发挥各个组织的作用。党的基层组织，是其他基层组织的领导核心。一切工作都应该在党组织的统一领导下进行。但统一领导必须和发挥各个组织的作用结合起来，才能把工作全面作好。党的基层组织，都应该加强对管委会、共青团、妇女会及其他各个组织的领导。要把这些组织团结在自己的周围，通过它们发动广大群众，搞好各项生产和工作。要定期研究讨论各个组织的工作，经常指导它们的活动，在各项中心工作中，根据它们的特点，具体分配任务，要求它们结合中心任务搞好各方面的工作。这样，可以使基层党的组织减少具体事务，便于集中精力研究重大问题，做好政治思想工作，加强党的核心领导作用。
    最后，还有一个重要的问题，就是要充分依靠基层党组织进行工作。目前有的地方对于依靠基层党组织进行工作的问题，还没有引起应有的重视。他们习惯于用“一揽子”会议的方式布置工作，没有注意安排基层党组织和党员的活动，影响了党员积极性和党组织作用的充分发挥。在特殊情况下，召开较为扩大的会议是需要的。但是经常召开“一揽子”会议，是不妥当的。即使召开，也应该安排必要的党内活动。在一般情况下，凡属重大问题，都要先党内后党外，先在党内讨论，统一党内思想认识，然后再到群众中去经过讨论，贯彻执行。此外，上级机关派下去帮助工作的党员干部，必须在基层党组织的统一领导下进行工作。他们的任务主要是当好参谋，培养干部，总结经验，发现问题，研究办法，帮助基层党组织正确贯彻执行党的政策决议。而不能个人主观包办，简单的发号施令。这不仅是一个工作方法问题，而且是一个组织原则问题。党的组织应该教育帮助干部，注意改进个人与组织的关系，正确地发挥个人和党组织的应有作用。上级党组织必须注意加强党的基层组织工作，经常检查总结，交流经验，帮助他们改进工作方法，不断提高领导水平，以便把党的基层组织培养锻炼成为坚强的战斗堡垒，保证生产大跃进的顺利实现。
