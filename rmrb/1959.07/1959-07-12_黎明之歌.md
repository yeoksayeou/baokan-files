    Song of Dawn
    Cheng Guangrui
    —Dedicated to the Greek National Hero Glezos
    "The light has not yet appeared, but it will surely come."
    —Greek poet Giannis Ritsos
    That was a terrifying night in May, without moon or stars. You, like a brave eagle, spread your wings and flew to the ancient city of Athens. You tore down the swastika flag and raised the flag of free Greece, igniting a torch of hope in the boundless darkness. You stood on the ancient castle, looking up to see the dawn. At that time, the sleeping Aegean Sea was still shrouded in the haze of night. But, like countless stars hidden in the night sky, you saw ten thousand sparks of fire hidden in the land of your motherland. Dawn finally arrived, a joyous dawn, and from afar came the faint sound of the Red Army brothers marching in. ELAS flew down from the cliffs of Grammos, ① liberating the suffering motherland stained with blood. Heh heh, who knew that dawn would be as fleeting as lightning, flashing past the tear-stained eyes of the Greek people. The wolves of Scobie broke into the vineyards after the harvest again. ② The Sixth Fleet crashed into the Aegean Sea, where the wind and waves had just subsided. ③ Suffering began anew, boundless suffering! Everywhere was slaughter, everywhere appeared pools of blood. Before dawn, "our mountain eagle" had its wings broken, ④ and the young poet fell into a pool of blood singing "The Last Song!" ⑤ The flames of revenge are burning brightly, how can any Greek patriot's heart be calm? Brave man, you have raised your voice again to summon the dawn, ⑥ singing with your comrades as you fight against the darkness. Conspiracy and persecution have been tracking you all along. The executioners want to strangle all the roosters. But how can iron bars confine the song of freedom? How can violence frighten a hero who is full of courage? They want to tear down the flag of freedom that you raised that year, and raise a new fascist flag over Athens. Glezos, you are a great flag, a symbol of freedom, flying in the sky of Greece, summoning the dawn from afar. The whole world has seen this flag of freedom fluttering in the wind, and the whole world is shouting to the executioners: "Don't cut it down!" People believe that darkness will surely be buried by the song of freedom, and that golden dawn will surely arrive on the land of Greece! Dawn will surely arrive, it will be an eternal dawn, and you will hear songs rising outside the iron bars, and the crowing of roosters everywhere. The white columns of the Parthenon will be stained with the red glow of the morning sun again, ⑦ and the proud sun will slowly rise from the green waves of the Aegean Sea.
    Note: ① ELAS is the Greek People's Liberation Army. The Grammos Mountains were the base of the Greek People's Liberation Army.
    ② After the liberation of Greece in October 1944, the British imperialist army led by Scobie entered Greece and helped the Greek royalist fascists launch a civil war, frantically slaughtering the Greek people.
    ③ In March 1947, American imperialism began to openly interfere in Greek internal affairs, equipping the Greek government army with new weapons and launching a large-scale offensive against the Greek liberated areas.
    ④ Before dawn on March 30, 1952, the Greek reactionary government, under the direction of the United States, shot and killed the Greek national hero, member of the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party, Nikos Beloyannis. Beloyannis was the commander of a Greek guerrilla during the occupation by Hitler's army. Because of his bravery and skill in battle, the guerrillas called him "our mountain eagle."
    ⑤ The Greek hero, young poet Kostas Giannopoulos, was shot and killed by the Greek reactionary government on May 6, 1948. "The Last Song" was the last poem he wrote before his sacrifice.
    ⑥ In recent years, Glezos has served as the president of the Greek "Dawn Daily."
    ⑦ The Parthenon is on the Acropolis of Athens and is one of the great buildings of ancient Greece.

    黎明之歌
    程光锐
    ——献给希腊民族英雄格列索斯
    光明还没有出现，可是它一定会来临
    ——希腊诗人加·雅诺普拉斯那是个恐怖的五月之夜，没有月亮和星星，你像一只勇敢的鹰，展翅飞上雅典的古城。扯下卐字旗，升起了自由希腊的旗帜，在无边的黑暗里，燃起了希望的火炬。你伫立在古老的城堡上，抬头探望黎明，那时候，沉睡的爱琴海上依然夜色朦胧。可是，就像数不清的星星隐藏在夜空，你看见祖国的大地上隐藏着万点火种。黎明终于到来了，一个欢乐的黎明，远方隐隐传来红军兄弟进军的号声。爱拉斯飞下了格拉莫斯的峭岩绝壁，①解放了染遍鲜血的苦难的祖国大地。呵呵，谁知黎明竟像闪电一样短暂，倏忽驰过泪痕未干的希腊人民眼前。斯考比的狼群又闯进了丰收后的葡萄园。②第六舰队又撞碎了风浪刚息的爱琴海面。③苦难又重新开始了，无边的苦难啊！到处又是屠杀，到处又出现了血泊。黎明之前，“我们的山鹰”被折断了双翼，④青年诗人高唱着“最后之歌”倒在血泊里！⑤复仇的火焰呵，燃烧得红光熊熊，哪个希腊爱国者的心中能够平静？勇敢的人，你又扬起了召唤黎明的歌喉，⑥和着伙伴的歌，在这同黑暗搏斗的时候。阴谋和迫害一直在你的身后追踪，刽子手们要扼住一切雄鸡的喉咙。可是，铁窗怎能关住自由的歌声？暴力怎能吓得了混身是胆的英雄？他们要扯下你当年升起的自由旗帜，要把新的法西斯旗在雅典上空升起。格列索斯，你就是一面大旗，自由的象征，飞扬在希腊的天空里，召唤着远方的黎明。全世界都看到了这面自由的大旗迎风飘飘，全世界都向刽子手大喝：“不准把它砍倒！”人们都相信黑暗一定会被自由的歌声葬埋，在希腊的大地上，金色的黎明一定会到来！黎明一定会到来，那将是永恒的黎明，你将听到铁窗外歌声四起，遍野鸡鸣。巴特农神殿的白色圆柱又染上朝霞的红光，⑦骄阳缓缓升起，从那绿波飞舞的爱琴海上。
    注：①爱拉斯即希腊人民解放军。格拉莫斯山区是希腊人民解放军的根据地。
    ②1944年10月希腊解放后，由斯考比率领的英帝国主义军队开入希腊，帮助希腊保皇法西斯发动内战，疯狂屠杀希腊人民。
    ③1947年3月，美帝国主义开始公开干涉希腊内政，用新式武器装备了希腊政府军，对希腊解放区发起了大规模的进攻。
    ④1952年3月30日黎明前，希腊反动政府在美国指使下，枪杀了希腊民族英雄、希共中央委员贝劳扬尼斯。贝劳扬尼斯在希特勒军队占领期间是一支希腊游击队的司令员，由于他饶勇善战，游击队员们都叫他是“我们的山鹰”。
    ⑤希腊英雄、青年诗人加斯塔斯·雅诺普拉斯在1948年5月6日被希腊反动政府枪杀。“最后之歌”是他牺牲前写的最后一首诗。
    ⑥近年来，格列索斯任希腊“黎明日报”社长。
    ⑦巴特农神殿在雅典城堡上，是古代希腊的伟大建筑之一。
