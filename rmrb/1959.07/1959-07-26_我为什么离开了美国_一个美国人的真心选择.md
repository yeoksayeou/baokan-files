“Why I Left America”
—A Genuine Choice of an American

(Our dispatch) Former U.S. Air Force Major Libero Riccardelli, with his wife and three children, left the United States for the Soviet Union, requesting to work in the Soviet Union and become a Soviet citizen. On July 19, the Soviet "Pravda" and "Izvestia" both published his statement to the Soviet press.

In his statement, Riccardelli said: After a long period of consideration, I finally made a firm decision: to go to the Soviet Union with my whole family! Requesting to become a Soviet citizen. The main reason I did this is because I am convinced that under the capitalist system, my whole family has no future.

He said: I am faithful to the idea of human freedom. However, in the United States, freedom is limited and monopolized by groups such as Rockefeller and Morgan. True freedom is in the socialist world.

I was born in Massachusetts, USA, in 1917. My father was a bricklayer. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, I was forced to drop out of school and work with my father, and later became a worker in an aeronautical company. In 1942, I volunteered for the Air Force and requested to be sent to Europe to fight the fascists. I flew "B-24" bombers fifty times behind enemy lines. Due to my combat achievements, I was promoted to Major by the time I retired.

Even during the war, the government promised us that we would have a great future when we returned home. I also hoped that after returning home, I could live a well-fed life with my newlywed wife and future children. However, my expectations were shattered. I wanted to start a business in residential construction, but life made me realize that there was no place for small business owners in the United States, and they were severely squeezed by large corporate groups. The Republicans in opposition restricted loans to small business owners. Helpless, I gave up my ideal career and went to Florida to find a job. I couldn't find a job, and I couldn't go home either, because the house had to be sold due to financial difficulties.

Day after day, my horizons began to broaden, and I gradually realized that my painful experiences were insignificant compared to the tragedies of the workers. I have worked with workers for many years, and I have personally seen dozens of workers' families who could not find work even after traveling from one state to another, and sometimes had to sleep four or five people in one bed, living an inhuman life.

I have seen many times people sacrificed their lives for the sake of opposing the Nazis and striving for democracy. Today I cannot help but ask myself: Did we fight in the past to pave the way for McCarthyism and for the so-called democracy of persecuting all people with different opinions?

A society full of racial hatred and national discrimination cannot be called democratic. No one in Florida does not know that if merchants need cheap labor, they can find it in the "colored" labor market. In 1958, a black man who worked with me in the forest fainted from hunger and lost consciousness. Similar phenomena are common in the southern United States.

In recent years, when I and several friends read the reports about the Soviet Union, communism, and international policies in the newspapers controlled by the capitalists, we finally learned to judge right and wrong. The truth, deliberately concealed by false propaganda, has gradually been recognized. I am deeply shocked by the aggressive policies of the big business government and the Pentagon generals.

In the past, during the war, I knew that I was throwing bombs at the enemies of our people and all mankind. Now I ask myself, who will I be bombing next time? No, my conscience does not allow me to drop bombs on peaceful Russian cities and villages.

As a father of three children, I cannot but consider the impact of the American way of life on my children. Are they destined to be sacrificed in a new war adventure? Are they destined to suffer the hardships of unemployment? Is it possible for them to receive higher education for free in this "equal" country? Will my children not be swallowed up by the huge wave of juvenile delinquency?

I have gained immense happiness in coming to the Soviet Union. I have personally seen the world of difference between capitalist society and the new socialist world. I have observed that dozens of nationalities live together in harmony. I have confirmed that the Soviets have no individualistic ambitions such as getting rich, racial discrimination, etc. The people here are full of enthusiasm looking forward to the future, and they have no fear of tomorrow. In this atmosphere, I can't help but want to do something. I am willing to dedicate the rest of my life to the just and humane cause of communism.

I am not a Communist, but my experience has led me to the conclusion that communism is the only savior of mankind.

Libero Riccardelli wrote in his statement with excitement and gratitude: I have decided to become a Soviet citizen, this is my sincere choice. I sincerely thank the outstanding Soviet people for letting me stay and work, and share the beautiful present and bright future with them.

### “我为什么离开了美国”——一个美国人的真心选择

    “我为什么离开了美国”
    ——一个美国人的真心选择
    本报讯　美国前空军少校里伯罗·里恰德利带着妻子和三个孩子全家离开了美国来到苏联，要求在苏联工作和做苏联公民。7月19日，苏联“真理报”和“消息报”都刊登了他向苏联新闻界发表的声明。
    里恰德利在声明中说：我经过了长时间的考虑，最后采取了坚决的决定：全家到苏联去！要求作一个苏联公民。我这样作的主要原因是，我确信，在资本主义制度下，我全家都没有前途。
    他说：我忠于人类自由的思想。然而，在美国，自由是有限的，它为洛克菲勒和摩根等集团所垄断。真正的自由是在社会主义世界。
    我1917年生于美国马萨诸塞州，父亲是一个泥水匠。当三十年代经济萧条时期，我被迫辍学，同父亲一起工作，后来又到航空公会企业当一名工人。1942年我志愿参加空军，要求派到欧洲去同法西斯分子作战。我曾驾驶“B—24”型轰炸机，五十次飞行于敌人后方，由于战斗功绩，到退伍时我已升为少校。
    还在战争期间，政府就对我们许愿说，将来回家以后前程万里。我也曾期望回国后，能同我新婚的妻子和未来的孩子们过着温饱的生活。然而我的期望破灭了。我曾想在住宅建设方面作一番事业，但生活使我认识到，美国没有小企业家的位置，他们备受大企业集团的排挤。在野的共和党限制给小企业者的贷款。我无可奈何地放弃了我的理想的事业，到佛罗里达州去找工作。工作没找到，回家也不成了，因为房子由于经济困难被迫卖掉了。
    日复一日，我的眼界开始扩大，我逐渐认识到，我的痛苦经历如果同工人们的悲剧比起来是不值一提的。我和工人们一起劳动了多年，我亲眼看到数十个工人家庭，他们走了一个州又一个州也找不到工作，有时不得不四五个人睡在一张床上，过着非人的生活。
    我多次看到人们为了反对纳粹和争取民主而牺牲了生命。今天我不禁要问自己：难道我们过去就是为了给麦卡锡主义开辟道路，为了迫害一切观点不同的人这样的所谓民主而战斗的吗？
    不能把充满了种族仇恨和民族歧视的社会称作是民主的。佛罗里达州的人没有一个不知道，如果商人需要廉价劳动力，他们可以在“有色”劳动市场上得到。1958年，同我一起在森林里干活的一个黑人，因为饥饿晕倒，不醒人事。类似这种现象，在美国南部是屡见不鲜的。
    近几年来，我和几个朋友在读资本家们所控制的报纸上关于苏联、共产主义和国际政策的报道时，终于学会了评定是非。被虚假的宣传故意掩盖的真理逐渐被人们认清。我深为大商人政府和五角大楼的将军们的侵略政策所震惊。
    过去在战争中，我知道是向我国人民和全人类的敌人掷炸弹。现在我扪心自问，下一次要我向谁掷炸弹呢？不，我的良心不允许我向和平的俄国城市和乡村丢炸弹。
    作为一个三个孩子的父亲，我不能不考虑美国生活方式对孩子们的影响。难道他们命定地要在一次新的战争冒险中牺牲吗？难道他们命定地要遭受失业的苦难吗？他们在这个“平等”的国家里有可能免费获得高等教育吗？我的孩子不会被儿童犯罪的巨浪吞没吗？
    我获得了莫大的幸福来到了苏联。我亲眼看到资本主义社会同新的社会主义世界之间的天壤之别。我观察到，几十个民族和睦地生活在一起。我证实，苏联人根本没有发财致富、种族歧视等个人主义的野心。这里的人们满怀热望注视着未来，他们对明天没有任何恐惧。在这里的气氛中，我不由得自己想干些事。我愿意把我的余生献给公正的、人道的共产主义事业。
    我不是共产党员，但是我的经历使我作出结论：共产主义是人类唯一的救星。
    里伯罗·里恰德利以激动的、感激的心情最后在声明中写道：我决定做苏联公民，这是我真心的选择。我衷心感激杰出的苏联人民，让我留下来工作，同他们共享美好的现在和灿烂的未来。
