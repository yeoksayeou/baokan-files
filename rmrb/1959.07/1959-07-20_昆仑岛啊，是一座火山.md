A sharp sword cannot sever a river; iron chains cannot lock up people's hearts. How can the Seventeenth Parallel cleave a beautiful land in two? The Vietnamese in the North are deeply worried and disheartened. When speaking of the South to foreign friends, they repeat it again and again. They speak of the bright moon by the sea, the sunny days on the plains, the rice of Saigon, the palaces of Hue... The people of the North, ah, think of their brothers day and night. The South lies under the whip, the South hangs on barbed wire. The South is a vast hell, the South is a killing field. Yet the South, ah, is also a great volcano. The spark of hatred is ignited in everyone's heart. Executioners, don't you dare go to Kunlun Island, Kunlun Island, ah, is a volcano. More than four thousand prisoners, filled with anger, want to burn the sea dry! Don't even think about establishing military bases in Ban Me Thuot, Ban Me Thuot, ah, is also a volcano. They will raise the swords and guns of the past and charge towards the traitors. The shouts are like a tide, drowning out the trickling streams on the plateau. The winding mountains, the curving coastline, the lush coconut groves and bamboo thickets, are all volcanoes! From Hue to Đồng Tháp Mười, from the Hiền Lương River to the Cà Mau peninsula, the American-Ngo clique will find no comfortable chairs. You are sitting on the top of a volcano, with magma over a thousand degrees below. One day it will erupt, turning you to ashes in an instant. The spark of fire bursts forth from the unyielding daughter Trần Thị Lý. The spark of fire bursts forth from the blood of the innocent in the Phú Lợi concentration camp. The spark of fire bursts forth from the hearts of more than ten million Southerners. The fire is raging, waiting only for the east wind! The east wind comes from the North, from Hanoi, from the hearts of loved ones, from the side of Uncle Ho. American interventionists, get out of here! Traitors, lay down your butcher knives! On Vietnamese soil, there is only one country: the Democratic Republic of Vietnam! On Vietnamese soil, there is only one flag: the gold star red flag!

    昆仑岛啊，是一座火山……
    袁鹰利剑斩不断河水；铁链锁不住人心，十七度线，怎能把锦绣河山劈成两半？北方的越南人双眉紧锁心神黯然。向外国朋友说到南方，一遍又一遍。说海边的明月，说平原的晴天，说西贡的大米，说顺化的宫殿……北方人啊，日日夜夜把兄弟思念。南方躺在皮鞭下，南方挂在铁丝网上。南方是一座大地狱，南方是一座杀人场。然而南方啊，也是一座大火山。仇恨的火种在每个人心底点燃。刽子手你们休要到昆仑岛去，昆仑岛啊，是一座火山。四千多囚犯满腔怒火要把大海烧干！休想在邦美蜀建立军事基地，邦美蜀啊，也是一座火山，他们会举起当年的刀枪，冲向卖国贼。呐喊声像海潮淹没了高原上的溪水潺潺。逶迤的山区，弯弯的海岸，椰林翠竹丛，到处是火山！从顺化到同塔梅从贤良江到金瓯滩地，美吴集团，没有你们的安乐椅。你们坐在火山顶上，那下面一千多度的岩浆，有朝一日喷出来，顷刻之间，把你们化为灰烬。从不屈的女儿陈氏里的身上迸发出火种。从富利集中营无辜者的血里迸发出火种。从一千多万南方人的心头迸发出火种。火种熊熊，只待东风！东风从北部来，从河内来，从亲人心里来，从胡伯伯身边来。美国干涉者，快滚回去！卖国贼，放下你的屠刀！在越南土地上，只有一个祖国：越南民主共和国！在越南土地上，只有一面国旗：金星红旗！
