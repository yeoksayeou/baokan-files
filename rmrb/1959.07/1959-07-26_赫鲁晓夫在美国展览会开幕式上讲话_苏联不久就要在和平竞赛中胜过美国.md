Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 25th: Khrushchev, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and others attended the opening ceremony of the American Exhibition in Moscow on the 24th.

When Khrushchev, Kozlov, and other Soviet government leaders arrived at the exhibition, U.S. Vice President Nixon, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Thompson, and others greeted them at the entrance.

Khrushchev and Nixon delivered speeches at the opening ceremony.

In his speech, Khrushchev expressed his belief that the opening of the exhibition would help further bring the Soviet and American people closer together.

Khrushchev said that our two countries have different social systems, but we advocate peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition. He expressed his belief that in the near future, the Soviet Union would catch up with industrial "sprinters" like the United States.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union has repeatedly expressed its hope to develop trade with the United States on a mutually beneficial basis without restrictions or discrimination. But unfortunately, this position of the Soviet Union has not received due understanding from some people in the United States.

Khrushchev said that some American newspapers openly stated that the American Exhibition was intended to boast the "superiority of private enterprise" and use this method to blow up the social foundations of the Soviet state, making the Soviet people desire to return to the capitalist system. He said that only those who do not understand our people would have such ideas.

Khrushchev said that if U.S. President Eisenhower has the opportunity to visit the Soviet Union, we would be very happy. I believe that such a visit would be of great benefit to improving relations between our two countries and consolidating world peace.

In his speech, Nixon said that the Soviet exhibition recently held in the United States vividly reflected the tremendous achievements and progress made by the Soviet people.

Nixon pointed out that if the United States is ahead of the Soviet Union in the production of consumer goods, then the Soviet Union has surpassed the United States in other aspects, such as the size of rockets used for exploring outer space.

Nixon acknowledged that there are still unemployment and racial discrimination problems in the United States.

He also pointed out that differences must be discussed and resolved at the conference table, not on the battlefield.

Nixon also read a letter from the U.S. President congratulating the opening of the exhibition. Eisenhower said in the letter that he was amazed by the achievements made by the Soviet Union in science and industry. He also said that differences in government policies had created rifts in the alliance during World War II. Efforts must be made to bring the United States and the Soviet Union closer together, and he also expressed his continued expectation to visit the Soviet Union.

Thousands of guests attended the opening ceremony of the American Exhibition and visited the exhibition.

    赫鲁晓夫在美国展览会开幕式上讲话
    苏联不久就要在和平竞赛中胜过美国
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫等在24日出席了在莫斯科举行的美国展览会开幕式。
    当赫鲁晓夫、科兹洛夫和苏联政府其他领导人来到展览会时，美国副总统尼克松、美国驻苏联大使汤普森等人在展览会门前迎接他们。
    赫鲁晓夫和尼克松在开幕式上讲了话。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中表示相信，展览会的开幕将有助于苏美两国人民的进一步接近。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们两国社会制度不同，但是我们主张和平共处，和平竞赛。他表示相信，在不久的将来，苏联将赶上美国这样的工业“快跑能手”。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联曾不止一次地希望在互利的基础上不受限制和歧视地同美国发展贸易。但是十分遗憾，苏联这种立场并没有得到美国某些人士的应有的谅解。
    赫鲁晓夫说，个别的美国报纸公然说，美国展览会是指望吹嘘“私人经营的优越性”，用这种办法来爆破苏维埃国家的社会基础，使苏联人产生回到资本主义制度的愿望。他说，只有不理解我国人民的人才会有这样的想法。
    赫鲁晓夫说，如果美国总统艾森豪威尔先生有机会访问苏联，那我们是非常高兴的。我认为，这样的访问对改善我们两国关系和巩固世界和平将有很大益处。
    尼克松在讲话中说，不久前苏联在美国举办的展览会生动地反映了苏联人民取得的巨大成就和进步。
    尼克松指出，如果说美国在生产消费品方面走在苏联的前面，那末，苏联在其他方面，例如在用于研究星际空间而制造的火箭的体积方面超过了美国。
    尼克松承认，美国还存在着失业现象和种族歧视问题。
    他又指出，必须在会议桌上，而不是在战场上讨论和解决分歧。
    尼克松还宣读了美国总统祝贺展览会开幕的信。艾森豪威尔在信中说，苏联在科学和工业上所取得的成绩使他感到惊叹。他又说，政府政策的不同在第二次世界大战时期的同盟中造成了裂痕。必须尽力求得美苏两国的彼此接近，他还表示一直期望到苏联访问。
    数千名客人参加了美国展览会的开幕式，并且参观了展览会。
