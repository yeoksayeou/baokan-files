    Under the Leadership and Cultivation of the Party, Cadres of All Nationalities Are Growing Rapidly
    (Our Dispatch) The vast numbers of Mongolian and other ethnic minority cadres active on all fronts in Inner Mongolia, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and with the patient assistance and cultivation of a small number of experienced Mongolian and Han veteran cadres, have grown rapidly in the process of implementing ethnic regional autonomy policies, carrying out various democratic reform movements, and socialist construction. To date, more than 130,000 ethnic minority cadres have been trained throughout the region. These cadres have become the backbone of various tasks in the autonomous region and have played a significant role in promoting the development of various construction undertakings in the autonomous region. Many outstanding ethnic cadres in Inner Mongolia hold leadership positions in governments and Party committees at all levels. Among the forty-five members of the People's Committee of the Autonomous Region, twenty are Mongolian, accounting for more than 44% of the total number of members. Including Hui, Manchu, and Daur members, they account for 51.12% of the total number of members. Among the 126 banner Party secretaries in the region, 68 are Mongolian cadres, accounting for 53.96%. Among these cadres, 66% have joined the Communist Party of China and the Communist Youth League. This makes it easier to combine the Party's policies with the actual situation in the autonomous region, thereby strengthening the Party's leadership over various tasks in the autonomous region and its ties with the people of all ethnic groups.
    In the early days of the establishment of the autonomous region, there were very few Mongolian cadres, and some departments had almost no Mongolian cadres. After twelve years of implementing the policy of "large-scale training, bold promotion, and bold use" and the "mentoring" of Mongolian and Han veteran cadres, as well as running various schools, training classes, and sending students to specialized schools outside the region for further study, a large number of intellectuals and cadres from peasant and herdsmen backgrounds have been trained. Now, not only are ethnic cadres holding leadership positions in the Party committees and government systems, but also in factories, farms, companies, shops, and institutions of higher learning and secondary schools. There is also a group of ethnic cadres engaged in theoretical and cultural arts, as well as scientific and technological work. Ethnic cadres in these departments account for 12.4% of the total number of cadres. For example, at the Baotou Iron and Steel Complex, one of the three major national steel bases built in the autonomous region, the Party paid attention to the training of Mongolian and other ethnic minority cadres and workers from the region from the very beginning. At present, there are 94 Mongolian cadres, including the deputy manager of Baogang General Company, the manager and deputy manager of Baogang Direct Subsidiary, and engineers. The company recently planned to equip 345 Mongolian technical cadres and enterprise management personnel during the second five-year plan period, and at the same time, the number of Mongolian workers will reach about 4,000. At present, more than 1,700 workers from Mongolian, Daur, Hui, Manchu, and Ewenki ethnic groups are participating in production and study at the Baogang construction site and technical schools satisfactorily. The vast majority of Mongolian cadres scattered in the rural and pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia are activists or children of poor peasants and herdsmen who emerged from mass movements. They live a hard life, have a firm stand, are good at contacting the masses, and are familiar with production knowledge, and play a major role in leading and mobilizing the masses to complete various tasks. For example, Bao Yinbilige (Mongolian), who was a slave in the old society and is now a deputy league leader, lived among the herdsmen when he was the banner chief of Siziwang Banner, helping herdsmen feed lambs, sweep sheep pens, and pull sheep grass. Sometimes he even went grazing with the herdsmen and even braved the wind and snow to ask doctors for the sick. Therefore, the herdsmen loved him, told him what was on their minds, and affectionately called him "Manai Hao Xigunda Rege" (Mongolian: Our Banner Chief). Even after he became the deputy league leader, the herdsmen often went to see him.

    在党的领导和培养下
    各族干部迅速成长
    本报讯　活跃在内蒙古各个战线上的广大蒙古族及其他少数民族干部，在中国共产党领导下，经过少数久经锻炼的蒙汉老干部的耐心帮助和培养，在推行民族区域自治政策过程中，进行各项民主改革运动和社会主义建设中，迅速成长起来。到目前为止，全区已培养出少数民族干部十三万多人。这些干部已成为自治区各项工作中的骨干，对推动自治区各项建设事业的发展，起了巨大作用。内蒙古有不少优秀的民族干部，在各级政府、党委担任着领导工作。自治区人民委员会四十五个委员中就有二十个委员是蒙古族，占委员总数44％以上，加上回、满、达斡尔族委员就占委员总数的51.12％。在全区一百二十六名旗党委书记中，蒙古族干部就有六十八名，占53.96％。这些干部中已经有66％参加了中国共产党和共青团。这样，使党的各项政策与自治区的实际就更易于结合起来，从而加强了党对自治区各项工作的领导与各族人民群众的联系。
    自治区成立初期，蒙古族干部很少，有些部门几乎没有蒙古族干部。经过十二年来贯彻执行“大量培养、放手提拔、大胆使用”的方针和蒙汉老干部“带徒弟”，以及开办各种学校，办各种训练班，送区外专科学校深造等办法，已经培养出大量知识分子和农牧民出身的干部。现在，不仅党委、政府系统有民族干部担任领导工作，在工厂、农牧场、公司商店、高等、中等学校中均有民族干部担负着领导工作。还有一批从事理论和文化艺术、科学技术工作的民族干部。这些部门的民族干部已占其干部总数的12.4％。如建设在自治区的国家三大钢铁基地之一的包头钢铁总公司一开始，党就注意了对区内蒙古族和其他少数民族干部工人的培养。目前，已有蒙古族干部九十四名，其中有包钢总公司副经理、包钢直属公司经理、副经理、工程师等。这个公司最近规划在第二个五年计划期内还将配起三百四十五名蒙古族技术干部和企业管理人员，同时期内，还将使蒙古族职工达到四千人左右。目前已有蒙古族、达斡尔、回、满、鄂温克等民族工人一千七百多人在包钢工地和技术学校胜任愉快地参加生产和学习。散布在内蒙古农村、牧区的蒙古族干部，绝大部分是在群众运动中涌现出来的积极分子或贫苦农牧民子弟，他们生活刻苦，立场坚定，善于联系群众，熟悉生产知识，在领导和发动群众完成各项任务中，都起着重大作用。如在旧社会当过奴隶，现在当了副盟长的宝音必力格（蒙古族），他在四子王旗当旗长时，一到牧区，就生活在牧民群众中，帮助牧民喂羊羔、扫羊圈、拉羊草，有时还同牧民一道去放牧，甚至冒着风雪给病人请大夫。因此，牧民都热爱他，把内心的话向他讲，还亲热地称他“玛乃好希棍达热嘎”（蒙语：我们的旗长）他当了副盟长后牧民还经常去看他。
