Flowers of Friendship
Solidarity Courtyard
	In Hohhot's Xincheng East Luofeng Street, there is an ordinary courtyard where seven families live: one Mongolian, three Manchu, and three Han. They are loving and helpful to each other, and people praise it as the "Solidarity Courtyard."
	Since the Mongolian woman Niji Ma became the director of the street's residents' committee, she has been working tirelessly outside. Seeing Niji Ma's enthusiasm for public welfare, Li Xiulan, a Han woman in the same courtyard, was deeply moved. Therefore, when Niji Ma was out working, she often took the initiative to clean up Niji Ma's house and sometimes even cooked fragrant lunch or dinner for her, waiting for her return. Niji Ma becomes emotional when talking about this. Warmly caring for the collective and others has become a way of life for the people of all ethnic groups in this courtyard. When Wang Zengfu, a Manchu cadre's wife, gave birth last year, women of all ethnic groups in the courtyard warmly came to help. Some Mongolian women even sent fried rice and butter to the mother to nourish her body. (Wang Wenliang)
Saving Relatives Late at Night, Delivering Firewood from a Hundred Li Away
	This spring, a unit of the People's Liberation Army was digging alkali in Halichabu Lake on the Inner Mongolian grasslands. One night, just as the soldiers were preparing to sleep, a Mongolian man came galloping from afar. He seemed very anxious. Xiao Bao, a Mongolian civil servant in the command post, quickly asked him, "Comrade, what's the matter?" The man said, "It's urgent. My elders and children are very sick. I heard that the People's Liberation Army is here, so I came to ask the PLA doctors to treat them." Li, the political commissar on duty, immediately ordered Doctor Zhao Min'an to take the hygienist Kang Quan to the rescue in an ambulance. Political Commissar Li also told the driver, "The patient's condition is very serious, the faster the better."
	Late at night, the car sped across the prairie. Suddenly, dark clouds gathered, and a strong wind rose. In an instant, the snow covered the wilderness. After the car arrived at Old Budan's yurt, the doctor hurriedly got out of the car to diagnose a young woman and two children, giving them injections and medicine. After a period of care, the doctor left medicine, gave instructions, and bid farewell. In a few days, the patients were all well.
	The snow kept falling, and the grassland became even colder. Old Budan, deeply grateful to the People's Liberation Army, was afraid that the cold weather would freeze the soldiers, so he sent five thousand jin of hay from a hundred li away. He said excitedly, "The Han doctors of the People's Liberation Army saved my relatives. I will never forget the kindness of the People's Liberation Army. The weather has been very cold these days, so I sent some hay, please comrades use it to pad your beds." Old Budan's enthusiasm deeply touched the hearts of the soldiers. The soldiers repeatedly declined, but to no avail, so they accepted the hay and sent two yellow sheep to Old Budan as a reward.

Mongolians and Hans are as Close as Brothers
	The Construction Brigade of the Shaha Commune in Hangjin Houqi, Inner Mongolia, has increased its wheat sowing task to 6,000 mu this year. During the tense sowing season, they have to harrow the land, spread manure, and sow seeds, and they felt that the labor force was very difficult. The general party branch of the brigade issued an emergency mobilization order, mobilizing all members of the team to seize all the time to rush to sow, mobilizing all cadres, cooks, feeders, nursery workers, iron and carpenters, etc., from the elderly in their seventies to children around ten years old, all enthusiastically responded, and immediately set off a spring sowing climax. Three Mongolian herdsmen north of the Yinshan Mountains passed by and, seeing this situation, also took the initiative to join the ranks of this battle. Wearing Mongolian national costumes, singing Mongolian tunes, and wielding borrowed shovels, they worked very energetically, spreading forty carts of manure in two hours. The local Han farmers happily said: "It is really good that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao lead us, the Mongolian and Han people are as close as brothers." (Duan Suizhu) (with picture)

    友谊的花朵
    团结院
    在呼和浩特市新城东落凤街上，有一个普通的院落。院内住着七户人家。一户蒙古族、三户满族，另外三户是汉族。平日，他们友爱互助，人们称赞为“团结院”。
    “团结院”里的蒙古族妇女尼吉玛，自从担任了街道的居民委员会主任以后，成天废寝忘食地在外奔波。同院汉族妇女李秀兰看到尼吉玛这种热心公益的精神，深受感动，于是，她经常在尼吉玛外出工作的时候，主动地把尼吉玛的家里整理打扫得干干净净，有时还替尼吉玛做好了香喷喷的中午或晚上的饭菜，等她归来。尼吉玛一谈到这件事，就激动起来。热诚地关心集体和别人，已成了这个院子里各族人民的生活风尚。满族干部王增福的爱人去年生孩子时，院里的各族妇女，都热诚地前来帮忙，有的蒙古族妇女还把炒米和黄油送给产妇保养身体。（王文亮）
    深夜救亲人，百里送柴草
    今春，解放军某部在内蒙古草原上的哈里察布湖挖碱。一天晚上，战士们正准备睡觉，忽然从远方飞奔来一个骑马的蒙古人。这个人表现得很紧张。指挥部的蒙古族公务员小包连忙问他：“同志，你有什么事？”那人说：“有急事，我家大人和孩子病得很厉害，听说解放军来了，我特来求求解放军的大夫给治病。”当时在场的李政委立即命令医生赵民安带领卫生员康全马上乘救护车去抢救。李政委还对司机说：“病人情况很严重，车越快越好。”
    深夜，汽车在草原上急驶。突然阴云密布，狂风暴起，霎时间大雪复盖了原野。汽车到达老布旦的蒙古包后，医生急忙下车为一个青年妇女和两个小孩患者诊断，给病人打了针、服了药。经过一段时间的护理后，医生就留下药品，作了吩咐，告辞回去了。不几天，患者的病都好了。
    大雪一直不停的下着，草原上益加寒冷了。对解放军深怀感激的老布旦，怕寒冷的天气冻坏了战士，特从百里之外送来了五千斤干草。他激动地说：“解放军的汉族医生，救活了我的亲人，我永远忘不了解放军的恩情，这几天天气很冷，特送来些干草，请同志垫在铺上。”老布旦的热心肠深深感动了战士的心。战士们再三谢绝无效，就收下了干草，送给老布旦两只黄羊作为酬谢。
                          （张并志文）
      蒙汉亲如兄弟
    内蒙古杭锦后旗沙海公社建设大队，今年的小麦播种任务增加到六千亩。在紧张的播种时期，又要耙地撒粪，还要下种，感到劳力非常困难。大队党总支特为此发出紧急动员令，动员全队社员抓紧一切时间，突击播种工作，动员令发出后，上至七十多岁的老人，下至十岁上下的儿童，全队干部、炊事员、饲养员、保育员、铁木匠等都热烈响应，马上就掀起了春播高潮。阴山以北的三位蒙古族牧民，路经此地，看到这种情景后，也主动地参加了这个战斗的行列。他们穿着蒙古民族的服装，唱着蒙古小调，挥舞着借来的铁锹，干得非常带劲，两小时就撒开了四十车土粪。当地汉族农民高兴地说：真是共产党毛主席领导的好，蒙汉人民亲密的像兄弟一样。（段随柱）（附图片）
