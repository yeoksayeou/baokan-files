"The Father of Ice Mountains" – Muztagh Ata

Muztagh Ata, rising 7,546 meters above sea level, is located on the western border of Xinjiang, about 200 kilometers southwest of Kashgar, bordering the Tajik Republic of the Soviet Union to the west. It stands proudly amidst the Pamir Plateau mountain range. The mountain is barren, covered entirely in ice and snow hundreds of meters thick, except for cliffs and the mountain base. More than ten silvery-white glaciers extend from the cliffs straight down to the foot of the mountain on all sides, creating a majestic scene.

Local Kyrgyz and Tajik herdsmen, as well as Uyghur farmers, all call this mountain "The Father of Ice Mountains." Because of its immense height and the perennial snow and ice, the herdsmen also regard it as an embodiment of "greatness" and "holiness," loving, worshiping, and praising it.

Muztagh Ata is more than 1,900 meters higher than Europe's highest peak, Mount Elbrus. The mountain's climate is unpredictable, with frequent heavy snowfalls even in the hot summer. At times, the temperature drops to minus 10, 20, or even 30 degrees Celsius. After the snow on the mountain melts, it freezes into ice rock, and ice axes must be used to carve out steps for climbing. Above 6,800 meters, not only is there a lack of oxygen and extreme cold, but the snow is also loose, making it difficult to move forward.

As early as 1894, the famous Swedish traveler Sven Hedin attempted to climb this peak four times, but he never reached higher than 6,800 meters. Half a century later, in 1947, the Briton Eric Shipton and his friend also came here. Although they climbed to around 7,000 meters, they were eventually attacked by the severe cold and had no choice but to retreat down the mountain. It was not until July 31, 1956, that the summit of this world-renowned mountain was first reached by mankind. On this day, thirty-one members of the Sino-Soviet mixed mountaineering team braved winds of force seven or higher and temperatures of minus 14 degrees Celsius, setting a world record for the collective and safe ascent of this high mountain peak.

More than two years later, on July 7, 1959, thirty-three of our young male and female mountaineers once again collectively and safely climbed this high mountain, setting another new world mountaineering record.

### “冰山之父”——慕士塔格山

    “冰山之父”——慕士塔格山
    拔海七千五百四十六米的慕士塔格山位于新疆西部边境，离喀什市西南约二百多公里，西临苏联塔吉克共和国，它傲然耸立在帕米尔高原群山之中。山上草木不生，除悬崖和山脚以外，全复盖着上百米厚的冰雪。十余条银白色的冰河，从山崖中直伸到四面山脚下，气势雄伟。
    当地柯尔克孜族和塔吉克族牧民，以及维吾尔族农民，都把这座山叫作“冰山之父”。牧民们还因为它无比高大，冰雪万年亘古不消，把它当作“伟大”和“神圣”的化身，爱戴它、崇拜它和讴歌它。
    慕士塔格山比欧洲最高峰——厄尔布鲁士峰，还要高出一千九百多米。山上的气候变化无常，即使是炎热的夏天，山上也经常大雪纷飞。有时，气温要降到摄氏零下一、二十度甚至三十多度。山上的积雪融化以后，又凝成冰岩，登山时必须用冰镐挖出台阶，才能继续前进。在拔海六千八百米以上，不仅缺氧气和非常寒冷，而且积雪疏松，使人难以前进。
    早在1894年，著名的瑞典旅行家斯文·赫定曾经四次试图登上这个高峰，但他始终没能到达拔海六千八百米以上的地方。半个世纪以后——在1947年，英国人埃·希普顿和他的朋友也曾经来到这里。他们虽然登到拔海七千米左右的地方，但后来终于被严寒袭击，也无可奈何地败退下山。直到1956年7月31日，这座世界闻名的高山之巅才第一次留下了人类的足迹。中、苏混合登山队的三十一名队员，在这一天冒着七级以上的大风和摄氏零下十四度的严寒，创造了集体安全地登上这座高山顶峰的世界纪录。
    两年多以后，在1959年7月7日这一天，三十三名我国年轻的男、女登山运动员，再一次集体安全地登上了这座高山，又一次创造了世界登山新纪录。
