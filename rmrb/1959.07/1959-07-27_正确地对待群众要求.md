    Correctly Handle Mass Demands
    Yi Huai
    The Yingju Cooperative in Fengqiu County, Henan Province, which Comrade Mao Zedong introduced in "Red Flag" last year, is now a production team of the Yingju Commune. The Party branch of the Yingju Production Team is very good at following the mass line. They require every Party member to make close friends among the masses around them. The branch committee meetings also frequently include Party members to widely absorb opinions from the masses. Because they act according to the demands of the majority of the masses and implement the policy of simultaneously developing agriculture and sideline occupations, the agricultural and sideline production of the Yingju Team has become a red banner in Fengqiu County.
    The working method of the Yingju Team's Party branch, which involves acting according to the correct demands of the masses, embodies the principle of "from the masses, to the masses."
    For grassroots Party organizations to truly achieve "from the masses, to the masses," they must first be able to correctly handle the demands of the masses. Acting according to the demands of the masses means proceeding from reality and acting according to the laws of objective development. The demands of the majority of the masses are the main problems that emerge in the development of objective things. When we grasp the current urgent demands of the masses, we grasp the main problems in real life. The initiative and foresight of our work will be enhanced, the Party's prestige among the masses will increase day by day, and the connection between the Party and the masses will inevitably become closer. Therefore, grassroots Party organizations should always pay attention to understanding the demands of the masses. When receiving instructions from higher authorities, they should understand the demands and opinions of the masses in this regard; in daily contact with the masses, they should also widely understand the opinions and demands of the masses at all times and in all places. Moreover, it is not enough to just understand; they must also analyze and study them, adopt those that can be adopted immediately, and start solving those that can be solved immediately. If major issues involving principles and policies are involved and must be reported to the higher Party committee for instructions, they should not just passively wait, but should actively reflect the situation, provide opinions, and prepare conditions for the higher authorities to solve problems in a timely manner. There should be full initiative and enthusiasm in dealing with the opinions and demands of the masses. In this way, not only can the demands of the masses be met, but also the instructions of higher authorities can be better implemented. Because the decisions and instructions of higher authorities are also formulated based on the demands of the masses.
    Correctly handling the demands of the masses is based on the analysis and study of the opinions and demands of the masses. Without analysis, there will be a tendency towards tailism. Taking an analytical attitude towards the demands of the masses is the only way to lead the masses forward along the correct path. Because, when Party organizations analyze the demands of the masses, they must consider not only the current and partial interests of the masses, but also the long-term and overall interests of the masses; they must consider not only whether the demands of the masses are correct and reasonable, but also whether there is currently the strength to handle them; they must consider not only which demands of the masses should be met, but also what measures should be taken to better realize the wishes of the masses, and so on. It can be seen that acting according to the demands of the masses requires strengthening the Party's leadership; otherwise, the rational demands and beautiful wishes of the masses cannot be realized.
    It is also possible that the Party organization, based on the demands of the masses, puts forward correct practices or proposals, and then takes them to the masses, and sometimes the masses will have different opinions. This requires patient publicity and education work. Some grassroots Party organizations, when the masses disagree with their propositions or decisions, often appease the masses and shelve them, or force them to be implemented without doing educational work, resulting in things going contrary to their wishes and failing to do their work well. So, what should we do when the masses disagree? Guo Mengcheng, the Party branch secretary of the Tieshan Production Team of the Guankou Commune in Xishui County, Hubei Province, has set an example that can be used as a reference.
    The Tieshan Production Team of the Guankou Commune in Xishui County, Hubei Province, has more than 200 mu of land near the river. The riverbed is higher than the farmland, and the river water seeps in, often resulting in no harvest. Branch Secretary Guo Mengcheng and an old farmer discussed a way: to break open the river dike and let the spring tide bring in sediment, then turn over the soil. In this way, the fields would become higher and the soil would become more fertile. Overcoming floods and ensuring increased production is certainly the urgent demand of the masses. However, the masses disagreed with Guo Mengcheng's plan, and even some comrades in the branch did not believe that this plan could be realized. Guo Mengcheng calmly analyzed the situation and found that the reason why the masses disagreed with his plan was mainly because they did not trust the strength of the branch. From then on, Guo Mengcheng worked hard, consciously leading the masses to overcome difficulties, develop production, and increase income, so that the masses believed from their own experience that the branch had the strength to lead everyone to overcome difficulties. After a period of hard work, without waiting for Guo Mengcheng to propose it, poor peasant activists took the initiative to demand digging dikes to fill the fields. Guo Mengcheng saw that his proposal had become the proposal of the masses, knew that the time was ripe, asked the higher authorities for approval, and began to lead the masses to dig dikes to fill the fields. Although this matter encountered unforeseen difficulties in the process, the fields were finally filled, rice seedlings were planted on time, and the yield was increased because the masses had high confidence, great enthusiasm, and the branch had strong leadership.
    Guo Mengcheng's practice shows that when the masses cannot accept the decisions or proposals of the Party organization all at once, they should do everything possible to improve the consciousness of the masses and actively do all kinds of work to turn the proposals of the Party organization into the proposals of the masses. Only in this way can we both lead the masses to realize the proposals of the Party organization, and not force orders, be detached from the masses; nor can we let things drift and be the tail of the masses. This correct working method is certainly not easy to master well, but we must strive to learn this working method and strive to learn from Comrade Guo Mengcheng.

    正确地对待群众要求
    易槐
    去年，毛泽东同志在“红旗”上介绍的河南封丘县的应举社，现在是应举公社的一个生产大队。应举生产大队的党支部是一个很会走群众路线的支部。他们要每个党员在自己周围的群众中交知心朋友。支委会开会还经常吸收党员参加，广泛吸取来自群众的意见。因为他们按照大多数的群众的要求办事，贯彻了农、副业并举的方针。所以，应举大队的农、副业生产成为封丘县的一面红旗。
    应举大队党支部按照群众的正确要求办事的工作方法，体现了“从群众中来，到群众中去”的原则。
    基层党组织要做到从群众中来到群众中去，首先要能够正确地对待群众的要求。按照群众的要求办事，也就是从实际出发，根据客观事物的发展规律办事。大多数群众的要求就是客观事物发展中出现的主要问题。我们抓住了群众当前的迫切要求，就是抓住了实际生活中的主要问题。工作的主动性和预见性就会增强，党在群众中的威信也会日益提高，党和群众的联系也必然更加密切。因此，基层党组织都应当时时刻刻注意了解群众的要求。在接到上级的某项指示的时候，要了解群众对这一方面的要求和意见；在平时和群众接触中，也要随时随地广泛地了解群众的意见和要求。而且，不只是了解，还要进行分析研究，能采纳的马上就采纳，能解决的马上就着手解决。如果涉及方针政策的重大问题，必须向上级党委请示的，也不要只是消极等待，而应当积极反映情况，提供意见，为上级及时解决问题准备条件。对待群众的意见和要求，应当有充分的主动性和积极性。这样，不但可以满足群众的要求，也可以更好地贯彻执行上级的指示。因为，上级的决定和指示同样是根据群众的要求制定的。
    正确地对待群众的要求，是建立在对群众的意见和要求分析研究的基础上的。如果不加分析，就会产生尾巴主义的偏向。对群众的要求采取分析的态度，才能领导群众沿着正确的道路前进。因为，党组织分析群众要求的时候，既要考虑群众的当前利益和局部利益，还要考虑群众的长远利益和整体利益；既要考虑群众的要求是否正确合理，还要考虑当前有没有力量去办；既要考虑到应该满足群众的那些要求，还要考虑采取什么措施才能更好地实现群众的愿望，等等。由此可见，根据群众要求办事，就要加强党的领导，否则，群众的合理要求和美好愿望就不可能实现。
    也可能发生这样的情况：党组织根据群众的要求，提出了正确的作法或主张，再拿到群众中去，有时候群众也会有不同意见的。这就需要耐心地进行宣传教育工作。有些基层党组织在群众不同意自己的主张或决定时，往往是迁就群众，搁置下来，或是不作教育工作硬要贯彻，以致事与愿违，不能把工作做好。那末，群众不同意的时候怎么办呢？湖北浠水县关口公社铁山生产队党支部书记郭孟成作出了榜样，可以参考。
    湖北浠水县关口公社铁山生产队有两百多亩地靠近河边，河床高于田地，河水向里渗透，常常没有收成。支部书记郭孟成和一位老农商量出一个办法：挑开河堤，让春潮把泥沙送进来，然后把田土翻上来，这样，田会变高，土也会变肥。战胜水患，保证增产，这当然是群众的迫切要求。可是群众却不同意郭孟成的计划，甚至支部的一些同志也不相信这个计划能够实现。郭孟成冷静地分析了情况，发现群众所以不同意他的计划，主要是不信任支部的力量。从此，郭孟成就艰苦地进行工作，有意识地领导群众克服困难，发展生产，增加收入，使群众从亲身体会中相信支部有力量领导大家战胜困难。经过了一段艰苦工作以后，没等郭孟成提出，贫农积极分子就主动地要求挖堤填田。郭孟成看到自己的主张已经变成群众的主张，知道时机已经成熟，请示上级批准，开始领导群众挖堤填田。这件事情在进行中虽然遇到了事先没有预计到的困难，但因群众的信心高、干劲大，支部的领导坚强，终于填好了田，按时插上了秧，提高了产量。
    郭孟成的作法表明，当群众一下子还不能接受党组织的决定或主张的时候，就应当千方百计去提高群众的觉悟，积极作好各项工作，把党组织的主张变成群众的主张。只有这样，才能既领导群众实现党组织的主张，又不强迫命令，脱离群众；也不放任自流，做群众的尾巴。这一正确的工作方法当然不是很容易就能掌握得好的，但是我们必须努力学好这个工作方法，努力向郭孟成同志学习。
