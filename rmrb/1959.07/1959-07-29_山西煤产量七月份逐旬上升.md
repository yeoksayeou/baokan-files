    Shanxi Coal Production Rises Every Ten Days in July
    Beijing Western Mining Bureau Adjusts Labor Organization and Improves Operating Techniques to Increase Labor Productivity
    Xinwen Mining Bureau Does a Good Job in Production Preparation and Speeds Up Tunneling to Meet the Needs of Coal Mining
    (Reported by our newspaper from Taiyuan on July 28) Coal mines in Shanxi Province are actively carrying out a large-scale bumper harvest competition to strive for the victorious completion of the state plan for July. A new production upsurge is sweeping across all coal mines in the province. The province's coal production in mid-July increased by 7.81% compared with the first ten days of the month, and production in the last ten days continued to rise. According to statistics, the average daily production level from the 16th to the 25th increased by 12.61% compared with the daily production level in the first half of the month.
    In the large-scale bumper harvest competition, many coal mines first focused on improving technology and popularizing advanced experiences, which greatly promoted the increase in coal production. Since the second half of the month, Lu'an Coal Mine has implemented a system where drilling and blasting workers go down the well in advance to make preparations, so that coal loading workers can start working as soon as they reach the work surface. They also improved the blasting method, adopting a "less blasting, frequent blasting" approach, and closely cooperated with coal mining, changing the past phenomenon of prolonged coal mining production breaks due to excessive blasting. Support workers also improved their operations, shortening the time for each support by six minutes. This greatly increased production and created good conditions for overfulfilling the state plan for July. At the same time, some coal mines have also taken measures to transfer basic construction workers to coal mining production, combined with tapping the potential of existing work surfaces, and expanding new work surfaces. Fenxi Coal Mine transferred more than 230 basic construction workers and more than 280 auxiliary workers from affiliated factories, which increased two tunneling and five small recovery work surfaces. The daily production level of the entire mine on the 26th and 27th has rapidly increased from 5,000 tons to more than 6,800 tons.
    In the battle for coal, many leading cadres of coal mines have gone down the wells to promptly hold on-site meetings and organize mass field trials to promote advanced experiences. After the cadres of Datong Silaogou Mine did this, production became very active. The 805 recovery work surface overfulfilled the plan of 240 tons per day, reaching more than 300 tons per day. Xishan, Fenxi and other coal mines also promptly organized maintenance personnel to go to production, timely maintain, and ensure production.
    Xinhua News Agency, July 28th: Workers and staff of the Beijing Western Mining Bureau are actively realizing the competition conditions proposed to coal mines across the country. The output of raw coal and the footage of tunneling have been increasing every ten days in July. The average daily output in the first ten days was 15,373 tons, which increased to 16,115 tons in the middle ten days, and further increased to 16,216 tons on average in the first six days of the last ten days. In terms of tunneling, the daily progress was 395 meters in the first ten days, and 427 meters in the middle ten days, an increase of 8.1% compared with the first ten days. The output of raw coal and the tunneling plan from July 1st to 26th were both overfulfilled.
    In the first half of this year, the Beijing Western Mining Bureau achieved great results in large-scale bumper harvests. Compared with the same period last year, raw coal production increased by 68.7%, labor productivity increased by 56%, and raw coal costs decreased by 30%. It won the large-scale bumper harvest red flag awarded by the Ministry of Coal Industry. As early as mid-June, the bureau had made a series of preparations for production in the third quarter.
    All mines universally pay attention to adjusting labor organization, reducing auxiliary time, strictly implementing the handover system, and closely cooperating between shifts and between types of work. In the past, after some team workers went down the well, due to on-the-spot preparations, there was often little coal produced in the first few hours and more coal produced in the latter few hours, resulting in unevenness in transportation. Now, the mutual preparation of tools and materials is taken as one of the competition conditions between shifts, so that the next shift can take over smoothly and immediately produce coal. Many teams also adopt methods such as drilling holes in advance and using blasting time to implement cross-operations, making full use of working hours and improving labor efficiency.
    Digging potential as much as possible to make some equipment by ourselves, and strengthening the maintenance and utilization of existing machinery and transportation equipment, have also played a significant role in increasing output. The mining bureau has taken various measures to make mine cars and electric drills by itself, and 150 mine cars and 18 electric drills have been put into production in July. The number of mine cars waiting for repair has also been greatly reduced. Some mines have established a palm surface mechanical inspection system and responsibility system, and the workshop has organized an inspection team to regularly go down the well to inspect mechanical equipment and maintain it in a timely manner, which also ensures the steady increase in output.
    In terms of improving operating techniques, each mine has taken measures such as large-scale ponding, deep-hole drilling, and multi-head circulation to improve production efficiency based on specific conditions. After the 26th group of Chengzi Mine's main roadway tunneling promoted the experience of one cycle per shift and deep drilling, the daily progress increased from 2.5 meters to 4.9 meters. The third group of Muchengjian Mine's recovery adopted the method of circulating ponding and enlarging the pond, and the mining height increased from about 6 meters in the past to about 10 meters, and the output in the first half of the month exceeded the plan by 12%.
    In order to strengthen the specific leadership of each production link, an engineering technical team was established with the participation of the deputy director of the mining bureau to solve key technical problems; a material management team was established to uniformly allocate equipment and raw materials. The mine leaders not only focused on production but also on the lives of the workers, not only focused on recovery but also on tunneling, not only focused on output but also on quality and safety. Leading cadres also often followed shifts to go down the well to work, and discovered problems and solved them in a timely manner, ensuring the steady increase in production.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, July 28th: Shandong Xinwen Mining Bureau earnestly strengthened production preparation work, initially reversing the passive situation where tunneling could not adapt to coal mining, and steadily increased coal production. The average daily output from July 16th to 24th has increased by 28.1% compared with the average daily output in the first ten days of the month. The recoverable period has also gradually increased, basically able to meet the needs of a steady increase in output.
    In early June, with the help of the working group sent by the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the Jinan Municipal Party Committee, the Xinwen Mining Bureau took various measures to strengthen production preparation work. From the bureau to the mines, they established tunneling leading groups to conduct a comprehensive assessment and ranking of development and production preparation work, selected 28 key work surfaces, and scheduled them by shift and by day, giving priority to meeting the needs of tunneling in terms of manpower and materials. At the end of April, there were only 119 tunneling teams in the entire bureau, but now it has been expanded to 145. Therefore, the tunneling progress has been greatly accelerated. While focusing on tunneling, the recovery front has also been strengthened to increase coal production.
    In the past few months, the party organizations of the Xinwen Mining Bureau have widely used methods such as four-level cadre meetings, worker representative meetings, and worker symposiums to listen to the opinions of the masses, improve their work, improve their leadership style, and mobilize the enthusiasm of the vast number of workers, which has achieved good results. Especially the four-level cadre meetings and worker representative meetings focusing on discussing increasing production and practicing economy in early July further stimulated the revolutionary drive of cadres and workers, and then launched socialist labor competitions between teams and between individuals, which rapidly increased the output of raw coal and the footage of tunneling.
    Currently, the director and chief engineer of the mining bureau have gone deep into the Zhangzhuang Coal Mine to specifically help them organize regular cyclic operations so that they can gain experience and promote it throughout the bureau. The mining bureau has recently established and improved the systems related to safety, quality inspection, and business management; and has promoted the team economic accounting system in more than 60% of the teams in the tunneling and recovery work types, so that business management is gradually becoming standardized. At the same time, they pay attention to strengthening the leadership of canteen work, etc., to further improve the daily lives of the workers. (Attached picture)

    用不断高涨的热情争取八月再高产！
    山西煤产量七月份逐旬上升
    京西矿务局调整劳动组织改进操作技术提高了劳动生产率
    新汶矿务局做好生产准备工作加快掘进进度适应采煤需要
    本报太原28日电　山西省各煤矿积极开展大面积丰产竞赛运动，力争胜利完成7月份国家计划。一个新的生产高潮正席卷着全省各个煤矿。全省煤产量7月中旬比上旬提高7.81％，下旬产量又继续上升。据统计，从16日到25日的平均日产水平，比上半月的日产水平提高了12.61％。
    许多煤矿在大面积丰产竞赛运动中，首先抓紧改进技术，推广先进经验，大大地促进了煤炭增产。潞安煤矿从下半月以来，打眼、放炮工人实行提前下井，做好准备，使装煤工一到工作面就可以开始工作。他们还改进放炮方法，采取“少放，勤放”的办法，和采煤紧密协作，改变了过去因放炮多而延长采煤生产间歇时间的现象。支柱工人也改进操作，使每次支柱时间缩短六分钟。这样，大大提高了生产，为超额完成7月份国家计划创造了好条件。同时，有些煤矿还采取抽调基本建设工人到采煤生产中来，结合挖掘现有工作面的潜力，扩大新的工作面。汾西煤矿抽调了基本建设工人二百三十多人和附属工厂的辅助工人二百八十多人，就增加了两个掘进和五个小回采工作面，全矿26、27日的日产水平已由五千吨迅速提高到六千八百多吨。
    在夺煤大战中，许多煤矿领导干部都纷纷下井，及时在井下召开现场会议和组织群众实地试验，推广先进经验。大同四老沟矿的干部这样做了以后，生产十分活跃，八零五回采工作面超额完成了日产二百四十吨的计划，达到日产三百多吨。西山、汾西等煤矿还及时组织了机件检修人员到生产当中，及时检修，保证生产。
    据新华社28日讯　京西矿务局所属各矿职工积极实现向全国煤矿提出的竞赛条件，7月份原煤产量和掘进进尺逐旬上升。上旬平均日产量是一万五千三百七十三吨，中旬提高到一万六千一百一十五吨，下旬的前六天又平均提高到一万六千二百一十六吨。掘进方面上旬日进三百九十五米，中旬日进四百二十七米，中旬比上旬提高了8.1％。7月1日到26日的原煤产量和掘进计划都超额完成。
    今年上半年，京西矿务局在大面积丰产中取得了巨大成绩，和去年同期相比，原煤产量提高68.7％，劳动生产率提高56％，原煤成本降低30％，获得了煤炭工业部奖给的大面积丰产红旗。早在6月中旬，这个局又为第三季度生产进行了一系列的准备工作。
    各矿普遍注意调整劳动组织，减少辅助时间，严格执行交接班制度，班与班、工种与工种之间密切协作。过去，有些班组工人下井以后，由于现作准备，常常是前几小时出煤少，后几小时出煤多，造成运输上的忙闲不均。现在，班与班之间把互相作好工具和材料的准备作为竞赛的条件之一，使下一班接班之后，得心应手，立刻能够出煤。许多班组还采取提前钻眼，利用放炮时间实行交叉作业等方法，充分利用工时，提高了劳动效率。
    尽可能挖掘潜力自制一些设备，加强对现有机械、运输设备的检修和利用，对提高产量也起了显著作用。矿务局采取各种办法自制了矿车和电钻，7月份已有一百五十辆矿车和十八部电钻投入了生产。原有矿车的待修数量也大大降低。有些矿建立了掌子面机械检查制度和责任制度，车间组织了检查小组，定期下井检查机械设备，及时维修，也保证了产量的稳步上升。
    在改进操作技术方面，各矿根据具体情况，采取大面积落塘、深孔钻眼、多头循环等办法来提高生产效率。城子矿主巷掘进二十六组推广了一班一循环和深打眼的经验以后，由日进二点五米提高到四点九米。木城涧矿回采三组采用了循环落塘和?大塘的办法，采高由过去六米左右加高到十米左右，上半月产量超过计划12％。
    为了加强对各个生产环节的具体领导，由矿务局副局长参加成立了工程技术小组，解决技术上的关键问题；成立了器材管理组，统一分配器材设备和原材料。各矿领导方面既抓生产又抓职工生活，既抓回采又抓掘进，既抓产量又抓质量和安全，领导干部并且经常跟班下井劳动，发现问题及时解决，保证了生产稳步提高。
    据新华社济南28日电　山东新汶矿务局认真加强生产准备工作，初步扭转掘进不能适应采煤的被动局面，使煤炭产量稳步上升。7月16日至24日的平均日产量，已比上旬平均日产量增长28.1％。可采期也逐步增多，基本上能满足产量稳步上升的需要。
    6月初，新汶矿务局在中共山东省委和济南市委派来工作组的帮助下，采取各种措施来加强生产准备工作。他们从局到矿井，成立了掘进领导小组，对开拓和生产准备工作进行全面摸底、排队，选择了二十八个关键性的重点工作面，按班、按日地进行调度，在人力和物力上也优先满足掘进的需要。4月底全局只有一百一十九个掘进队，目前已扩大到一百四十五个。因此掘进进度大大加快。在狠抓掘进的同时，也加强了回采战线，提高煤的产量。
    新汶矿务局的各矿党组织，在最近几个月里广泛运用四级干部会、职工代表会、工人座谈会等方式，听取群众意见，改进工作，改进领导作风，调动广大职工的积极性，收到了很好的效果。尤其是7月初以讨论增产节约为中心的四级干部会和职工代表会，更进一步激发了干部和工人群众的革命干劲，接着就展开了班组与班组、个人与个人的社会主义劳动竞赛，使原煤产量和掘进进尺迅速提高。
    目前，矿务局局长、总工程师已深入到张庄煤矿，具体帮助他们组织正规循环作业，以便取得经验后在全局推广。矿务局最近建立和健全了有关安全、质量检查、经营管理等方面的制度；在掘进、回采两个工种的60％多的班组里，推行了班组经济核算制，使经营管理逐渐走向正规。同时，他们注意加强对食堂工作等的领导，以进一步改善工人的日常生活。（附图片）
