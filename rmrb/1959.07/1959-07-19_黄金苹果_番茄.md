    Golden Apple - Tomato
    Zhu Mi
    People have only been eating tomatoes for about two hundred and fifty years, which is a very short time in the history of various edible crops.
    Tomatoes were introduced to Europe after they were discovered in the Americas in the mid-sixteenth century. The original name of tomato in Mexico - "tomatl" - was also imported to Europe, so many European and American countries and the Soviet Union still call tomatoes "tomatl" to this day. After tomatoes arrived in continental Europe, they settled in gardens in Belgium, Britain, and other countries, and were regarded as ornamental plants with beautiful fruits. They even entered homes and became plants for interior decoration. At that time, tomatoes were also called "golden apples," but despite having the name "apple," people did not dare to eat them, thinking they were poisonous. Therefore, tomatoes were also called "wolf peaches." Although people did not eat tomatoes, they used the fruit to treat scabies.
    It took about a century and a half for people to learn to eat tomatoes. The German botanical dictionary published in 1811 had a record of tomatoes being edible: it is generally believed that tomatoes are poisonous plants, but Spaniards add chili, garlic, and butter to their fruits to make dishes, while Portuguese and Bohemians even use its fruits as condiments, and this kind of seasoning is slightly sour and exceptionally delicious.
    Once people knew that tomatoes were not only edible but also extremely nutritious, they immediately became popular. China also cultivated them three or four hundred years ago, and the "Qunfang Pu" (a book on botany) has records of "Fan Shi" (foreign persimmons), which were used for ornamental purposes only. It was not until forty or fifty years ago that they began to be eaten. Since then, cultivation has gradually spread throughout China.
    Tomatoes contain more minerals and are very rich in vitamins A, B, C, and provitamin D. In particular, vitamin C is not only the most abundant, but also has the unique advantage of being unaffected or only slightly affected by cooking, which is unmatched by ordinary vegetables. Tomato fruits also contain appropriate amounts of digestive aids such as malic acid and citric acid, and certain sugars, making them sweet and sour when eaten. In addition, tomato fruits contain more amino acids, making them very tasty.
    Tomatoes taste very good when eaten raw and are a popular and excellent fruit in summer. Before eating, blanching them in boiling water makes it easy to peel them and also has a disinfecting effect. However, blanching them for too long will make them sour, because the proteins in the fruit that act as buffers are destroyed, and the sour taste becomes apparent.
    When tomatoes are available in large quantities, we can make our own tomato sauce. The method is very simple: take ripe tomatoes, remove the stems, wash them, put them in a pot of boiling water and cook them until they are done, take them out and rub them into a fine paste, then filter them with two layers of gauze. Boil the filtered juice, put it in bottles, and seal it. The entire process should not be dragged out for too long to avoid souring. If you need to store it for a long time, you can put it in bottles first, and then boil the bottles in boiling water to sterilize them. You can also add some salt or other spices to the juice. This bottled tomato juice is the famous tomato sauce. If you boil the filtered juice in a pot and add appropriate amount of white sugar, you can boil it into tomato paste, but it takes a lot of sugar.

    黄金苹果——番茄
    朱米
    人们吃番茄（西红柿）也不过二百五十年左右，这在各种农作物食用历史中算是很短的了。
    那是十六世纪中叶在美洲发现之后，番茄才传到了欧洲。番茄在墨西哥的原名——拖玛脱也一并输入欧洲，所以一直到现在欧美许多国家和苏联还是把番茄叫拖玛脱。番茄到欧洲大陆之后就在比利时、英国等花园中定居下来，被大家当成一种看果子的观赏植物，并且登堂入室，成为装饰室内的植物了。当时番茄又被人们称为“黄金苹果”，但是虽有苹果之名，人们并不敢吃它，以为是有毒的东西，因之番茄又被称为“狼之桃”。人们虽不吃番茄，却把它的果实拿来治疥疮。
    大约过了一个半世纪，人们才懂得吃番茄。1811年出版的德文植物学辞典中才有关于番茄能吃的记载：一般认为番茄是有毒的植物，但是西班牙人把它的果实加辣椒、大蒜和牛油作菜吃，而葡萄牙人和波希米亚人甚至用它的果实作调味汁，这种调味汁稍带酸味异常可口。
    当人们一旦知道番茄不但可以吃而且营养极其丰富时，马上就普遍风行起来。我国在三、四百年前也有栽培，“群芳谱”上就有“蕃柿”的记载。那时只作为观赏，直到四、五十年前才开始食用。从此我国各地才逐渐栽培起来。
    番茄含有较多的矿物质和很丰富的维生素甲、乙、丙和维生素丁原。尤其维生素丙不但含量最丰富，还有在煮熟后不受或少受破坏的独到之处，这是一般蔬菜所不及的。番茄果实中还含有适量的、助消化的苹果酸和柠檬酸等与一定的醣类，使吃的时候酸甜适口。再加之番茄果实中有较多的胺基酸，味道很鲜美。
    番茄生吃的风味很好，是夏季大众化的优良水果。在食用前用开水烫一下就很容易去皮，而且起了消毒的作用。不过烫久了就会变酸，这是因为果实中起缓冲作用的蛋白质受到破坏，酸味就显出来了。
    在番茄大批上市的时候，我们可以自己动手做一些番茄沙士。方法很简单：把成熟了的番茄，摘去果梗、洗净，放到开水锅中煮熟，捞出来搓成细浆，然后用两层纱布过滤，滤出的汁液煮开装瓶密封即成。所有操作过程不要拖拉得太长了以免变酸。如果需要长期保存，可先装瓶，再把瓶放在开水锅中煮沸消毒即可。在汁液中还可加入一些盐或其他香料。这种瓶装的番茄汁就是大名顶顶的番茄沙士。如把过滤后的汁液放在锅中煮沸后加入适当的白糖，就可熬成番茄酱，不过十分费糖。
