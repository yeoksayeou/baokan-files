Summarize Wheat High-Yield Experience
Guide This Year's Autumn Planting Work
Shaanxi Holds Symposium of Old Farmers and Scientific and Technical Personnel

(Our newspaper dispatch) Recently, at the wheat high-yield technology conference held in Shaanxi Province, agricultural scientific and technical personnel and old farmers gathered together, learning from each other's strengths and jointly studying and summarizing the experience of wheat harvest, to guide this year's autumn planting work.

The agricultural scientific and technical personnel, professors, old farmers, and model laborers who attended the meeting provided a large amount of experimental data from various aspects, carefully summarized the role of each individual factor in the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" on crop yield increase and the interrelationships between them, and analyzed and explained them theoretically. This provided valuable data and basis for wheat production in the coming year.

Judging from the practice of deep plowing in the first year, the effect of deep plowing on yield increase varies with soil and farming system. Generally, deep plowing to one foot shows a significant increase in yield compared to shallow plowing to four to five inches. Deep plowing of dry land results in a greater increase in yield than deep plowing of paddy fields. Early plowing results in a greater increase in yield than late plowing. Deep plowing of clay soil results in a greater increase in yield than deep plowing of sandy soil. Within a certain depth, the deeper the plowing, the greater the increase in yield. However, under the current conditions of tight labor and animal power in rural areas, the general depth can be around one foot, and in areas with deeper soil layers, it can be deep plowed to one and a half feet. It is best to carry out deep plowing during the dog days of summer, so that the turned-up soil can be exposed to the scorching sun and rain for a relatively long time, which can improve soil fertility and water retention capacity.

Combining deep plowing with layered fertilization and applying sufficient base fertilizer will play a greater role in improving the soil. Using summer fallow land to plant green manure and turning it over and burying it forty to fifty days before planting wheat has a very high fertilizer effect. Topdressing should be done early rather than late, preferably in early winter, to promote tillering of seedlings and root development before the New Year; applying a quick-acting fertilizer again around the jointing stage to meet the fertilizer requirements of wheat at this time can increase the number of fertile ears and grains. If third-class wheat fields appear in early spring, they can catch up with first-class wheat fields as long as fertilizer is applied in time.

Fertilization should be coordinated with watering in order to achieve the effect of water and fertilizer on yield increase. Watering should be done "according to the weather, the land, and the crops," to ensure timeliness and appropriate amount. Excessive watering can easily lead to lodging. Generally, watering is needed when the soil moisture content drops below 17%, and the amount of watering should be appropriate for small ridges of thirty to fifty centimeters per mu each time. In order to adapt to the water demand of densely planted wheat, the effect of underground irrigation using hole-type and pipeline-type methods is good.

During the summarization process, old farmers and agricultural scientific and technical personnel expressed their opinions freely, and the discussion was very enthusiastic. Finally, a consensus was reached, and those that could not be concluded were also reserved for further experimentation. For example, Professor Zhao Hongzhang of Northwest Agricultural College proposed "high fertilization, less seeding, and dense planting," that is, when soil fertility is improved, the tillering and number of ears of wheat will greatly increase, so the purpose of reasonable close planting can be achieved by using sparse sowing methods. Old farmer Liu Xijie believes that the appropriate amount of sowing should be determined based on the earliness of the sowing period, the height of the emergence rate, the size of soil fertility, and the severity of natural disasters. Based on the current production level and land conditions, sparse sowing cannot guarantee yield increase. Most people, starting from the current production reality, believe that the old farmer's view is correct; however, the former's opinion can be continued to be explored and tested as an academic issue.

Old farmers and agricultural scientific and technical personnel discussed together, learning from each other's strengths and making the summarized experience more perfect. For example, old farmers in Xingping, Weinan and other counties used the method of burying soil and cutting leaves to prevent wheat stripe rust, with remarkable results, but they did not know why. Experts such as Liu Hanwen, Hu Guangrong, and Lu Duanyi used scientific principles to explain why this method is effective, because stripe rust parasitizes on wheat leaves and spreads with the wind, and dies with the drying of wheat leaves. The method of burying soil and cutting leaves to remove diseased wheat leaves and burying them in the soil can effectively prevent the spread of bacteria and eliminate the source of bacteria. Therefore, farmers call this method "local method, foreign theory." Agricultural scientific and technical personnel have also gained practical knowledge from the production experience of old farmers and enriched the theoretical content. Researchers such as Gong Rende of the Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences used to believe what was written in books that winter wheat that tillered in spring on the banks of the Wei River could not head, but when they saw winter wheat tillering in spring could also head, they felt strange and ran to ask the old farmers. The old farmers told them: as long as there is enough fertilizer and water to cultivate it well, not only can it head, but it can also be harvested. They said with emotion: "One sentence from an old farmer is better than reading books for several years."

Currently, provincial and local relevant departments are implementing the experiences that have been summarized into measures for wheat high-yield in the coming year to guide autumn planting and other work.

    总结小麦丰产经验
    指导今年秋播工作
    陕西召开老农和科学技术人员座谈会
    本报讯　最近，在陕西省召开的小麦丰产技术会议上，农业科学技术人员和老农在一起，互相取长补短，共同研究总结小麦的丰收经验，用以指导今年的秋播工作。
    到会的农业科学技术人员、教授和老农、劳动模范从各个方面提供了大量的试验资料，认真地总结了农业“八字宪法”中各项单独因素对作物的增产作用和彼此间的互相关系，并提高到理论上加以分析和说明，这就给来年小麦生产提供了宝贵的资料和依据。
    从深耕第一年的实践来看，深耕增产的效果随着土壤、耕作制度而不同。一般表现：深耕一尺比浅耕四至五寸增产显著，深耕旱地比深耕水地增产幅度大，早耕的比迟耕的增产幅度大，深耕粘性土的比深耕沙性土的增产幅度大。在一定的深度内，耕的深，增产幅度大。但在目前农村人畜力紧张的条件下，一般深度可在一尺左右，土层较深的地区可深耕到一尺五寸。深耕最好在伏天进行，让翻起来的土经过比较长时间的烈日曝晒、雨淋，能够提高土壤肥力和保墒能力。
    结合深耕，分层施肥，施足底肥，对改良土壤起的作用更大。利用夏季休闲地种植绿肥，在种麦前四十至五十天翻埋，肥效很高。追肥宜早不宜迟，最好初冬追施，便于促使幼苗年前分蘖和根系发育；拔节前后再追一次速效性的肥料，满足小麦在这个时候所需的肥量，可以增加结实穗数和粒数。早春若出现三类麦田，只要及早施肥，能够赶上一类麦田。
    施肥要和浇水互相配合，才能收到水肥对增产的效果。浇水应“看天、看地、看庄稼”行事，做到适时适量，浇水过多、过大，容易发生倒伏现象。一般情况土壤含水率下降到17％以下就需要浇水，浇水量每次每亩以三十至五十公分的小畦灌溉为宜。为适应小麦密植的需水量，用洞式和管道式的地下灌溉法，效果良好。
    总结过程中，老农和农业科学技术人员有什么意见就谈什么意见，讨论非常热烈，最后得出一致意见，不能做出结论的也予以保留，进一步进行试验。例如，西北农学院教授赵洪璋提出“高肥、少种、密植”，即在土壤肥力提高的情况下，小麦的分蘖与穗数会大大增多，因此用稀播的办法就可以达到合理密植的目的。老农刘希杰则认为播种量多少合适，要看播种期迟早、出苗率高低、土壤肥力大小和自然灾害轻重等情况来决定，根据当前生产水平和地力条件，稀播是不能保证增产的。大多数人从当前生产实际出发，都认为老农的见解正确；但前者提出的意见，可作为学术问题继续进行探讨和试验。
    老农与农业科学技术人员在一起讨论，互相取长补短，使得总结出来的经验更为完善。如兴平、渭南等县老农用埋土切叶的办法防治小麦条锈病，成效显著，但不知其所以然。刘汉文、胡光荣、路端谊等专家就用科学道理说明这种办法所以行之有效，是因为条锈病寄生于麦叶上，随风传播，随麦叶枯干而死亡。用埋土切叶的办法切除发病麦叶，并把它埋入土里，可以有效地防止病菌传播和消灭菌源。因此，农民把这种办法叫做“土办法、洋道理”。农业科学技术人员也从老农的生产经验中获得了实际的知识，丰富了理论内容。中国农业科学院陕西分院龚仁德等研究人员过去总是相信书上所记载的在渭河沿岸春季分蘖的冬小麦不能抽穗，可是当他们看见冬小麦在春季分蘖也能抽穗时，觉得奇怪，跑去问老农。老农告诉他们：只要肥足水饱培育好，不但能够抽穗，也能收成。他们感慨地说：“老农一席话，胜读几年书”。
    目前，省级和各地有关部门正在把已经总结出来的经验贯彻到来年小麦丰产的措施中去，指导秋播等工作。
