Over a Thousand Kinds of Special Commodities; Various Goods are Popular
Yunnan Commercial Departments Try Every Possible Means to Supply the Needs of Ethnic Minorities

(Our Dispatch) Yunnan Province's commercial departments have adopted various measures to strengthen commercial work in ethnic minority areas. The procurement, transfer, and sales plans for commodities needed by ethnic minorities were completed ahead of schedule and exceeded targets in the first half of the year. More than 1,100 kinds of special commodities needed by ethnic minorities have now been transported to the eight autonomous prefectures and other ethnic minority areas. These include more than twenty kinds of printed fabrics specially produced for the Dai, Miao, and Hani peoples, more than 5,000 dozens of jacquard towels for Dai women's headscarves, long knives favored by Jingpo hunters, and so on.

The special commodities transferred to ethnic minority areas in Yunnan are mostly supported by the interior, in addition to some produced in Kunming. This year, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Chengdu, and other places have produced more than 900 kinds of special commodities for various ethnic minorities in Yunnan. More than 5,000 dozens of jacquard towels were transferred from Shanghai, and more than 20,000 flower trims were shipped from Sichuan.

In recent years, due to economic development and the elimination of some outdated customs, the demand for commodities in production and life among various ethnic minorities in Yunnan has greatly increased, and the requirements for variety have also become richer and more diverse. For example, Ai Ni women in Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture used to wear hats full of silver ornaments when working, but now they want to buy cloth caps.

According to this new situation, Yunnan Provincial Nationalities Commercial Department has established processing plants for silver ornaments, lace, and other items in Kunming. At the same time, it has signed contracts with Kunming Dyeing Factory to produce a large number of printed fabrics favored by ethnic minorities. These factories vigorously innovate technologies, so that the commodities produced in the province have increased several times compared with the same period last year. Among them, there are more than twenty kinds of printed fabrics needed by ethnic minorities, an increase of two times over last year.

Yunnan Province's commercial departments have also strengthened grassroots commercial work in ethnic minority areas. Now, every commune in ethnic minority areas and every district in areas without communes have established or are establishing independently accounting central stores, and every management area (township) has established purchasing and marketing stores. This year, the eight autonomous prefectures will increase more than 5,000 commercial personnel. Relevant departments have also allocated special vehicles to be responsible for transporting commodities to ethnic minority areas.

### 特殊商品上千种　种种商品受欢迎  云南商业部门千方百计供应少数民族人民需要

    特殊商品上千种　种种商品受欢迎
    云南商业部门千方百计供应少数民族人民需要
    本报讯　云南省商业部门采取各种措施加强少数民族地区的商业工作，上半年少数民族所需商品的采购、调运和销售计划都提前超额完成了。现在已经有一千一百多种少数民族需要的特殊商品运往八个自治州和其他的少数民族地区。其中有特为傣族、苗族、哈尼等族人民生产的二十多种花布，五千多打傣族妇女包头用的提花毛巾，景颇人猎手喜爱的长刀，等等。
    调往云南少数民族地区的特殊商品，除了昆明生产一部分以外，大部分都是内地支援的。今年上海、杭州和成都等地为云南各少数民族生产了九百多种特殊商品。上海调来的提花毛巾有五千多打，四川运来的花边有二万多条。
    近年来，云南各少数民族由于经济发展和破除了一些陈规陋习，在生产和生活方面对商品的需要量大大增加，品种要求也更加丰富多样。例如西双版纳傣族自治州的僾尼族妇女，过去劳动时戴挂满了银饰的帽子，现在要买布便帽了。
    云南省民族商业部门根据这种新情况，在昆明建立了银饰、花边等加工厂，同时和昆明漂染厂订合同大量生产少数民族喜爱的花布。这些工厂大力革新技术，使省内生产的商品比去年同期增加几倍。其中少数民族需要的花布已有二十多种，比去年增加了两倍。
    云南省商业部门还加强了少数民族地区的基层商业工作。现在少数民族地区的每个公社和没有公社化地区的区都已经或正在建立独立核算的中心商店，每个管理区（乡）都建立购销店。今年八个自治州要增加五千多名商业人员。有关部门也拨出了专门的车辆，负责运输少数民族地区的商品。
