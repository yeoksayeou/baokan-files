Xinhua News Agency, Jinan—Chemical factories under the Shandong Provincial Bureau of Chemical Industry are adopting methods such as comprehensive utilization, economical use, finding substitutes, and recycling to solve raw material problems and actively increase the production of chemical industrial products.

In the first half of this year, the total output value of chemical factories under the Shandong Chemical Industry Bureau increased by 49.2% compared with the same period last year. Among the twenty-three main products, eight such as hydrochloric acid, calcium carbide, lithopone, and red lead increased by more than double compared with the same period last year; ten products such as fertilizers, pesticides, sulfuric acid, caustic soda, and calcium carbonate increased by 10%-50% respectively. Product costs also decreased by 5.77% compared to last year.

The Jinan Chemical Plant mobilized the masses to "dig for treasure," and the waste materials dug up in May and June alone can produce 145 tons of sodium sulfite and 60 tons of sodium thiosulfate. In the first half of the year, factories adjusted 122 types of major chemical raw materials, totaling 1,937 tons, which played a significant role in solving the temporary urgent needs of various factories.

Currently, the Shandong Chemical Industry Bureau has made specific arrangements for production in the second half of the year.

This newspaper reports that the Shanxi Provincial Department of Chemical and Petroleum Industry recently made a comprehensive deployment of the chemical industry's production tasks for the third quarter.

In the first half of this year, the output and quality of various chemical products in Shanxi have greatly improved. The actual output value of the province's chemical industry in the first half of the year increased by more than double compared with the same period last year. However, the development of the movement among enterprises is not balanced enough. When deploying the work for the third quarter, the Shanxi Provincial Department of Chemical and Petroleum Industry required all factories and mining enterprises, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, to fully mobilize the masses of workers and staff, recognize the importance of the third quarter for completing the annual plan, unify their thinking, clarify their tasks, exert sufficient effort, conscientiously implement the policy of walking on two legs, and further deepen the campaign to increase production and practice economy centered on technical innovation and technical revolution. Through the increase production and practice economy campaign, improve product quality, increase quantity, reduce costs, and improve enterprise management level. Establish and improve various technical operating procedures, strengthen equipment maintenance and repair, prevent accidents, and ensure normal production. The supply of raw materials for some chemical products in the third quarter is still very tight, which requires all enterprises to do everything possible to reduce raw material consumption and produce more chemical products with the same raw materials. In terms of capital construction, it is required to concentrate manpower, material resources, and financial resources to complete the finishing work, so as to promote new enterprises to put into production as soon as possible and provide products.

    开辟原料来源　提高生产效率
    山东山西大力增产化工产品
    据新华社济南讯　山东省化学工业局所属各化工厂，采取综合利用、节约使用、寻找代用、回收利用等方法，解决原料材料问题，积极增产化学工业产品。
    今年上半年，山东化学工业局各化工厂的生产总值比去年同期增长49.2％。在二十三种主要产品中，盐酸、电石、立德粉、铅丹等八种，较去年同期增长一倍以上；化肥、农药、硫酸、烧碱、碳酸钙等十种产品，分别增长10％—50％。产品成本也比去年实际降低5.77％。
    济南化工厂发动群众“挖宝”，仅5、6两个月挖出的废料，就可以生产亚硫酸钠一百四十五吨、大苏打六十吨。上半年各厂调剂了一百二十二种、一千九百三十七吨主要的化工原料，对解决各厂临时性的急需原料起了很大的作用。
    目前，山东化工局已对下半年生产作了具体安排。
    本报讯　山西省化学石油工业厅，最近对第三季度化工业的生产任务作了全面部署。
    今年前半年，山西各项化工产品的产量、质量都有很大提高。全省化学工业产品上半年实际完成的产值比去年同期增加了一倍以上。但各企业之间运动发展不够平衡。山西省化学石油工业厅在部署第三季度工作的时候，要求各厂矿企业在各级党委领导下，充分发动职工群众，认清第三季度对完成全年计划的重要意义，统一思想，明确任务，鼓足干劲，认真执行两条腿走路的方针，进一步深入地开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动。通过增产节约运动，提高产品质量，增加数量，降低成本，提高企业管理水平。建立与健全各种技术操作规程，加强设备维护检修，防止事故发生，保证正常生产。第三季度有些化工产品的原料供应仍很紧张，这就要求各企业千方百计降低原材料消耗，用同样的原材料，生产出更多的化工产品。在基本建设方面，要求集中人力物力财力，突击完成收尾工程，促使新建企业尽早投入生产，提供产品。
