Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, July 9th: In Hunan Province, over 16 million mu of early rice is turning golden, promising a bumper harvest. In the earlier-season areas south of the Five Ridges and on the Dongting Lake Plain, over ten counties have begun harvesting. It is expected that the entire province will begin harvesting in mid-July. From the tens of thousands of mu of early rice already harvested, the yield per mu is generally higher than last year. The new grain has arrived, and the vast countryside is filled with the joy of a bumper harvest.

Rushing to harvest early rice and rushing to transplant late rice are being carried out simultaneously; the opportune period for harvesting early rice and transplanting late rice is only half a month. In order to do a good job in the "double rush" within a short period of time, preparations have been underway in various places since June. The characteristics of this year are: early start, meticulousness, solidness, and comprehensiveness.

Various localities have also made full preparations for summer harvest tools. The province has organized more than 180,000 iron, wood, and bamboo craftsmen to repair and manufacture harvesting, transporting, drying, and storing tools in a timely manner. At present, the province has repaired and added more than 20 million large and small farm tools, which can basically meet the needs of the summer harvest. Various localities have also renovated a large number of warehouses and drying grounds to welcome the early rice into storage. According to statistics from eight counties in the Xiangtan Special District, more than 40,000 new and renovated granaries have now been built, and more than 120,000 drying grounds have been repaired.

Various localities have also made arrangements for the lives of the masses during the "double rush." In the Xiangtan Special District, 90% of the public canteens have stored half a month's worth of rice and have arranged for special personnel to cultivate vegetables to ensure that commune members eat well during the summer harvest. Three special districts, Changde, Hengyang, and Xiangtan, have organized more than 80,000 medical personnel to go to the countryside for mobile medical services. Yiyang County has also mobilized the masses to go to the mountains to collect local medicinal herbs for heatstroke prevention and epidemic prevention.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 9th: More than 6 million mu of early rice in Hubei Province is ripening successively. Chongyang, Xianning, Hanyang, Yunmeng, and other counties with earlier seasons have already begun to rush the harvest. In a few days, the work of rushing to harvest early rice will be fully launched.

This year, the area of early rice in Hubei Province has been expanded by more than 2 million mu compared to last year, and farmers in various places have attached great importance to the sowing and management of early rice. For example, they completed rice transplanting half a month earlier than last year, and most areas had more base fertilizer than last year. They also promoted rational close planting according to local conditions. After sowing, various localities also stepped up field management, so the early rice in many areas has strong stalks, large ears, and full grains. In recent days, farmers in various places have been busy leveling threshing grounds and repairing warehouses. People's communes in many areas have organized specialized teams for threshing, preparing fields, transporting fertilizer, and transplanting, striving to achieve "harvest one piece, cut one piece, plant one piece." The harvesting tools prepared by commercial and handicraft departments for farmers in various places have mostly been purchased and processed, and they have begun to be delivered to various production teams. Commercial departments in Qichun, Puqi, and other counties are organizing forces to deliver goods to the countryside.

According to the characteristics of this year's large early rice area, heavy workload, and tight schedule, various localities, in addition to making arrangements for labor early, have also established command organizations at all levels, striving for a complete victory in rushing to harvest early rice and rushing to transplant late rice.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 9th: Early rice in Sichuan has begun to ripen, and farmers throughout the province are actively preparing to participate in the battle to rush the harvest. In the southwest, along the Jinsha River and the Yangtze River, many places have begun to harvest.

This year, Sichuan Province's more than 4.7 million mu of early rice, due to timely sowing and transplanting, good planting, and good management, has grown thick stalks, long ears, and many grains. In places where harvesting has already taken place, news of increased production has been reported one after another. Facing such a bumper harvest year, farmers in various places are very enthusiastic and have made early preparations for harvesting. This year, because the early rice ripening season is late, and late rice transplanting must seize the season, many areas began to arrange labor in June. Many areas have also launched a concentrated campaign to do a good job of field management of major spring crops in advance, in order to concentrate all their strength on rushing to harvest and rush to transplant. At the same time, the work of industrial, agricultural, and commercial cooperation to add tools for rushing to harvest and rushing to transplant has also entered a new climax.

Under the slogan of "Early rice does not open the sickle, management does not stop," about 20% to 30% of the areas with later seasons still do not relax at the last moment, preparing for harvesting on the one hand, and grasping late-stage management of rice fields on the other. The main measures in various places are: a concentrated application of "filling fertilizer," disaster prevention, pest control, and preventing lodging. In a recent heavy rain, more than 2,000 mu of the 90,000 mu of early rice in Dazu County lodged. The entire county immediately dispatched more than 10,000 people to rescue day and night, and all the lodged early rice was raised within two days. Many places in the Jiangjin Special District have launched battles to encircle and suppress rice borers.

    抢收早稻  抢栽晚稻  劳力组织好　工具准备好
    据新华社长沙9日电　湖南省一千六百多万亩早稻已经一片金黄，丰收在望。季节较早的五岭以南地区和洞庭湖滨平原上，已有十多个县开镰收割。预计7月中旬，全省将全面开镰。从目前已经收割的几万亩早稻来看，亩产量一般都比去年提高。新谷登场了，广大农村洋溢着一片丰收的喜悦。
    抢收早稻和抢插晚稻是同时进行的；收早插晚的适时期限只有半个来月。为了在短促的时间内搞好“双抢”，从6月以来各地就进行准备。今年的特点是：抓得早，抓得细致，抓得扎实和全面。
    各地对夏收工具也进行了充分准备。全省组织了十八万多名铁、木、篾工，及时修理、制造收、运、晒、藏等工具，目前全省已整修添置的大小农具达两千多万件，基本上能满足夏收需要。各地还整修了大批仓库和晒谷坪，迎接早稻入仓。根据湘潭专区八个县统计，现在已新建和整修了粮仓四万多座，修好晒谷坪十二万多块。
    各地对“双抢”期间的群众生活也作了安排。湘潭专区有90％的公共食堂已储备半个月的大米，并安排了专人培育蔬菜，保证社员在夏收中吃得好。常德、衡阳、湘潭等三个专区组织了八万多名医务人员下乡巡回医疗，益阳县还发动群众上山采集防暑防疫土药。
    新华社武汉9日电　湖北省六百多万亩早稻正在陆续黄熟。季节较早的崇阳、咸宁、汉阳、云梦等县已经开镰抢割，再过几天，抢收早稻的工作就将全面铺开。
    今年湖北省早稻面积比去年扩大了二百多万亩，各地农民对早稻的播种和管理十分重视。例如，他们比去年提早半个月完成了插秧工作，大多数地区底肥都比去年充足，还因地制宜地推行了合理密植。播种以后，各地又抓紧了田间管理，因此许多地区的早稻秆壮、穗大、籽粒饱满。近日来，各地农民正在忙着平整稻场、修整仓房。许多地区的人民公社都分别组织了脱粒、整田、送肥和栽插等专业班子，准备做到“黄一块，割一块，栽一块”。各地商业和手工业部门为农民准备的抢收抢打工具，大都已采购和加工停当，并且开始送到各生产队，蕲春、蒲圻等县商业部门正组织力量送货下乡。
    各地根据今年早稻面积大、活路多、时间紧的特点，除及早对劳力作了安排外，还层层建立了指挥机构，力争抢割早稻和抢插晚稻的工作获得全胜。
    据新华社成都9日电　四川早稻开始黄熟，全省农民正在厉兵秣马，积极准备投入抢收战斗。在西南部的金沙江和长江沿岸，不少地方已开始挥镰收割。
    今年，四川省四百七十多万亩早稻，由于播种栽插及时，种得好，管得好，长得秆粗、穗长、粒多。已经收打的地方，纷纷传来增产的消息。面对着这样的大丰收年景，各地农民干劲很大，都及早地作了收割准备。今年由于早稻成熟季节晚，晚稻抢栽又必须抓住季节，许多地区从6月间就开始安排劳力。许多地区还展开突击运动，提前把大春作物的田间管理做好，以便集中全部力量投入抢收抢栽。和这同时，工农商大协作为抢收抢栽添补工具的工作，也进入新的高潮。
    在“早稻不开镰，管理不收兵”的口号下，约占20％到30％的季节较迟的地区仍不放松最后时机，一方面做好收割准备，一方面大抓稻田后期管理。各地的主要措施是：突击施“灌浆肥”，防灾、防虫、防倒伏。最近一场大雨中，大足县九万多亩早稻有两千多亩倒伏，全县立即出动一万多人日夜抢救，两天内就把全部倒伏的早稻扶起。江津专区许多地方都展开了围剿螟虫的战斗。
