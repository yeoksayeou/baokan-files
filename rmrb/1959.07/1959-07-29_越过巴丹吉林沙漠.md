    Crossing the Badain Jaran Desert
    Mou Sen Sun Jingming
    After more than twenty days of surveying the Gobi Desert with the comprehensive survey team of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' desert control team, our film crew began surveying the Badain Jaran Desert in May.

    The only means of transportation in the desert is the camel. It is rightly called the "ship of the desert." On the first day of riding camels, a third of the team fell off. Some fell off as soon as they got on, and some were thrown off while walking. The reason was that, apart from the guides and a few comrades, everyone was encountering camels for the first time and did not understand their temper or master them. The camels were also meeting these new masters for the first time and were a little flustered, so interesting scenes appeared constantly along the way.

    On this day, because everyone was unfamiliar with the work of saddling camels, tying luggage, and stacking packs, it took us from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM to get more than sixty camels ready to set off. In addition, accidents occurred constantly along the way, which delayed a lot of time. As a result, we had not reached the planned campsite of Heichengzi after walking forty li until 11:00 PM. Because it was dark and the road was difficult to recognize, we got lost and had to set up camp and wait for dawn to identify the direction.

    The next morning, the noisy sound of joy woke us from our dreams. It turned out that Heichengzi, which we had expected to reach last night, was only about five li diagonally behind us, because we had not noticed it last night in the dark and had passed it. Now, under the illumination of the morning sun, a very complete castle appeared very clearly. The round tower on the northwest corner of the city stood between the sand dunes and the Gobi Desert, appearing particularly majestic and magnificent.

    Heichengzi is about four li in circumference. The city wall is about six meters high and is still very complete, but some parts have been buried by the desert. There are some broken walls and ruins in the city. In a small round tower built of earth that had already collapsed, there were small clay Buddhas made of yellow earth and pictures with scriptures. On the northwest corner of the city wall, there is an earth tower similar to the White Pagoda in Beihai Park in Beijing. Outside the southwest corner of the city, there is a building like the Beijing Planetarium. The roof is round, and there are no wooden beams or wooden pillars inside. It is entirely built of earth, which is enough to show that the architectural level at that time was very high.

    It is said that the general who defended the city at that time was called General Hei (Black General), so people later called it Heichengzi (Black City). It probably has a history of four to six hundred years.

    The reason for the city's destruction is said to be that General Hei defended the city, and the enemy could not conquer it after repeated attacks. Finally, the enemy changed the river course outside the city, cutting off the city's water source, which led to the city's destruction. Based on the pile of thunderstones used for defending the city that we saw on the city wall, many of which were broken millstones, it can be determined that there had been a difficult war here. It is a pity that there were no archaeologists in our team, so we could not correctly infer the beginning and end of this city based on these relics.

    Because there was no water here, we only took some shots in a hurry in one day and continued to move forward.

    The role of the guide comrades was not small in ensuring that the expedition team could smoothly cross the Badain Jaran Desert according to plan. Because there is no road here at all, although the camels leave footprints, they cannot be seen after a strong wind. After basically mastering the direction, they can roughly march and camp according to plan by relying on memory and eyesight to look at the tops of the sand mountains.

    In our past imagination or in the desert seen in movies, it was mostly a barren sand, or undulating sand dunes like hills. But this time, after entering the Badain Jaran Desert, we were really surprised. It was completely a continuous stretch of large sand mountains, some as high as more than four hundred meters. Therefore, we can only walk up to two sand mountains a day, two up and two down, which takes most of the day, forty or fifty li.

    The climate in the desert is not only hot, but also very dry. Sometimes when the filter is dirty, you want to breathe on it to wipe it, but you can't, because the air in your mouth evaporates before it gets to the glass. Although the temperature reaches more than 40℃, there is no sweat on the body, also because it dries before it condenses into sweat. The rainfall in the desert is low for this reason.

    Although the climate in the desert is so dry, some plants adapted to this environment grow. In addition to plants such as saxaul, tamarisk, and red willow growing on the edge of the desert, plants such as sand wormwood, sand jujube, and caltrop also grow on the large sand mountains in the desert. In order to adapt to the dry and water-scarce environment, their leaves have degenerated into needles, and their roots are buried several meters deep in the sand.

    In the Badain Jaran Desert, there are many haizi (small lakes). According to the elderly Mongolians, there are 360 haizi. Although we have not seen so many, we have encountered quite a few. Because the climate is dry and the rainfall is low, many haizi have dried up. Some haizi that have not dried up have maintained a certain amount of water because there are springs underground. The haizi do not have fresh water, and most of them are salty salt ponds (also brine ponds), with high salt content. You can scoop out snow-white salt by reaching out your hand. Some have become brine, which is a beautiful red when the sun shines on it.

    The center of the Badain Jaran Desert, the Badain Jaran Temple, is built in the middle of two haizi, with mountains (sand mountains) and water, and the scenery is beautiful. It can be said to be a peach blossom spring in the desert.

    The time we entered the desert this time was chosen in early summer, not too cold and not too hot, and we avoided the windy season, so we hardly encountered strong winds in the desert for more than a month. But when we were finally leaving the desert, on the edge of the desert, God played a little joke on us.

    That day, after 10:00 PM, we had not yet reached the planned campsite. Like the first day we entered the desert, it was dark and we got lost, and we were hungry and thirsty. At this time, a strong wind suddenly rose, with flying sand and rocks. It was already dark and we couldn't see the road clearly, and at this time we couldn't even open our eyes. The camels were also frightened and ran around, some running away and disappearing, and there was no way to find them. The things they were carrying were scattered all over the ground. Our iron film box was also flattened. Our director, Comrade Lao Bai, was not only thrown off by the frightened camel, but was also dragged a long distance and kicked. Fortunately, the hoof was soft, otherwise it would have been serious.

    In such a chaotic situation, the Party organization, for the safety of the entire team, decided to stop and camp on the spot. Everyone endured hunger and thirst and spent an unforgettable stormy night.

    越过巴丹吉林沙漠
    牟森　孙景明
    我们电影摄制组随中国科学院治沙队综合考察队经过了二十几天戈壁滩上的考察工作后，在5月里开始进入巴丹吉林沙漠进行考察。
    在沙漠里唯一的交通工具就是骆驼，人们称它为沙漠之舟是有道理的。开始骑骆驼的第一天，全队就有三分之一的同志挨了摔，有的是一上骆驼就掉下来的，有的是在行走中被摔下来的，原因是除了向导和少数的几个同志以外，大家都第一次接触骆驼，还不了解它的脾气，掌握不了它。而骆驼和这些新的主人也是第一次见面，也有些惊慌，所以一路上有趣的场面不断出现。
    这一天因为大家对于给骆驼绑鞍子，捆行李，打垛子等工作都不熟悉，所以从下午两点钟开始一直到五点多钟才将六十多峰骆驼弄好出发。再加上路上不断发生事故，又耽误了不少的时间，因此四十华里的路程，一直走到夜里十一点钟还没有走到预定的宿营地——黑城子，因为天黑路不好认，迷了路，最后只得安营下寨，等天亮后再辨别方向。
    第二天早晨，吵吵嚷嚷的喜悦声把我们由梦中惊醒，原来我们预计昨晚到达的黑城子就在我们斜后方约五华里，是因为昨晚天黑没有发现而走过了。现在在朝阳的照耀下，很清楚地出现了一片很完整的城堡，城西北角上的圆塔，耸立在沙丘和戈壁之间，显得分外宏伟壮丽。
    黑城子方圆有四华里左右，城墙约有六米高，还很完整，只是部分的让沙漠埋没了。城里还有些断墙残壁。在一个已经坍毁了的用泥土修建的小圆塔里满是用黄土烧成的小泥佛和带有经文的图片。在西北角城墙上有一座与北京北海公园的白塔相似的土塔，在西南城角外面有一个像北京天文馆的建筑，屋顶是圆的，里面没有木梁也没有木柱，完全是泥土建筑的，这足以说明当时的建筑水平是很高的。
    据说当时这里守城的将军，人们称他黑将军，所以以后人们才叫它黑城子，大概有四百年到六百年的历史。
    这个城市毁灭的原因，传说是当时黑将军守城，敌人屡攻不下，最后敌人由城外改变了流过城下的河道，断绝了这个城市的水源，才使这个城市遭到了毁灭。根据我们在城墙上看到的一堆守城用的雷石，有很多是打碎了的石磨，可以断定这里有过艰苦的战争。遗憾的是我们队里没有考古学家，不能根据这些遗迹来正确推断这个城市的始末。
    因为这里没有水，我们只以一天的时间匆匆的拍了一些镜头，又继续前进。
    考察队能够顺利的按计划穿过巴丹吉林沙漠，向导同志的作用是不小的。因为这里根本没有路，骆驼走过虽然留下足迹，但是一场大风便什么也看不见了。他们在基本上掌握了方向之后，就凭记忆，凭眼力，看沙山的山头，就可以大致不错的按计划行军和宿营。
    在我们过去的想像中或者是在电影里看到的沙漠，大都是一片荒沙，或者是起伏不平像丘陵似的沙丘。但是这次进了巴丹吉林沙漠以后，实在使我们惊奇，完全是连绵不断的大沙山，有高达四百多米的。所以我们每天最多只能走两座沙山，两上两下就是大半天，四五十华里。
    沙漠里的气候不但热，而且还干燥得很，有时候滤色镜脏了，想哈一口气擦一擦，但是哈不上，因为嘴里的气不等到玻璃上就蒸发掉了。气温虽达40℃多，但是身上没有汗，也是因为不等凝聚成汗就干了。沙漠里的雨量少也是这个原故。
    沙漠里的气候虽然如此干燥，但是也有一些适应这样环境的植物生长。除了在沙漠边缘有索索、柽柳、红柳等植物生长外，在沙漠里的大沙山上也有沙蒿、沙拐枣、霸王等植物生长。它们为了适应干燥缺水的环境，叶子已经退化成针状，根子扎在沙子里几米深。
    在巴丹吉林沙漠里，海子（小湖）是很多的，据蒙古族老年人说有三百六十个海子，我们虽没有见到那么多，但是遇到的也不少。因为气候干燥，雨量少，很多海子都干涸了。一些没有干涸的海子是因为地下有泉而保持了一定的水量。海子没有淡水的，大多数是咸的盐池（也有卤池），含盐成分很高，伸下手去就可以捞出雪白的盐来，有的已经成了卤水，阳光一照，一片红色，很好看。
    巴丹吉林沙漠的中心——巴丹吉林庙就建筑在两个海子的中间，有山（沙山）有水，风景幽美，可以说是沙漠里的桃源。
    这次我们进入沙漠的时间，选择的是初夏，不冷也不太热，而又躲过了风季，所以在沙漠里一个多月的时间，几乎没有遇到大风。但是在最后出沙漠的时候，在沙漠的边缘上，老天却和我们开了一个小玩笑。
    那天，夜里十点多钟，我们还没有到达预定的宿营地，和进沙漠的第一天一样，天黑迷了路，又饿又渴，正在这个时候，突然狂风大作，飞沙走石，本来天黑就看不清路，这时连眼睛都睁不开了。骆驼也惊了，乱跑乱窜，有的跑的不知去向，也没有办法找，驮的东西丢的满地都是。我们的一个铁胶片箱子也摔瘪了。我们的导演老白同志不但被惊逃的骆驼摔了下来，而且还被拖了好远，更被踢了一脚。幸亏蹄子是软的，否则就严重了。
    在这样的混乱情况下，党组织为了全队的安全，决定停止前进，就地宿营。大家忍着饿渴，渡过了一个难忘的暴风雨之夜。
