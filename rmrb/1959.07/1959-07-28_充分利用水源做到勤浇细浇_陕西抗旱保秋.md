Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 27th. Areas in Shaanxi Province affected by drought are fighting to secure a bumper autumn harvest. Ankang Prefecture, which has taken swift action, has already diverted water to irrigate more than 195,000 mu of autumn fields and carried water to irrigate more than 255,000 mu of autumn fields. Hanzhong Prefecture has organized 400,000 laborers to repair more than 8,080 channels, intercept and store water at more than 1,100 locations; and has used more than 21,400 water lifting tools to irrigate autumn fields day and night in shifts. In Dali County, where the drought is relatively severe, more than 317,000 mu of autumn fields have been irrigated by the 23rd, of which 180,000 mu of cotton fields have been completely irrigated, some having been watered two to three times.

    Workers in ninety mechanical factories across the province are also rushing to manufacture irrigation and drainage machinery to support the fight against drought. According to recent statistics, they have rushed to produce more than 200 water pumps, over 11,000 horsepower of boiler-camel machines, and 14,900 kilowatts of electric motors for rural areas. The state-owned Huashan Machinery Factory has also sent people to Chang'an County to help various people's communes install and repair irrigation and drainage equipment.

    Since the summer harvest, except for parts of northern Shaanxi and western Guanzhong which have had heavy rainfall, the rest of Shaanxi Province has experienced very little rainfall, generally only about 10 millimeters. Small rivers have stopped flowing, reservoirs and ponds are short of water, and the water volume in large irrigation canals has decreased; some autumn seedlings are dry and yellow, and some rice fields are dry and cracked. In response to these situations, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee have issued notices several times, requiring the whole party and all the people to take action, go all out, and focus on drought resistance and prevention. After receiving these notices, various localities immediately took action, and responsible cadres in many areas personally led this work. However, drought resistance and prevention work has been progressing relatively slowly in some individual areas.

    Based on the recent development of the drought situation, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to immediately launch a mass movement to resist drought and protect the autumn harvest throughout the province. To this end, on the 24th, it issued an emergency instruction, requiring all drought-affected areas to focus on irrigation. With water conservancy facilities, regardless of canals, reservoirs, wells, ponds, or weirs, they must be fully utilized, irrigating frequently and carefully, and taking advantage of every minute to rotate irrigation day and night; water conservancy projects with remaining unfinished work must resolutely find ways to rush repairs; where there are no irrigation facilities, as long as there is water nearby, the masses should be organized to carry and splash water. The instruction requires each commune, team, and small team to repair one mu as one mu, and one fen as one fen, as much as possible to expand the irrigated area for small pieces of land with water sources that require less labor and yield quick results that can be turned into paddy fields. At the same time, it is also necessary to actively carry out weeding to preserve soil moisture, apply fertilizer and accumulate fertilizer, replant missing seedlings, and use all small pieces of land to plant autumn harvest crops or autumn vegetables.

### 充分利用水源做到勤浇细浇  陕西抗旱保秋

    充分利用水源做到勤浇细浇
    陕西抗旱保秋
    新华社西安27日电　陕西省发生旱象的地区，为了夺取秋季大丰收，正向干旱斗争。行动较快的安康专区已经引水灌溉秋田十九万五千多亩，担水点浇秋田二十五万五千多亩。汉中专区组织了四十万个劳力，整修渠道八千零八十多条，截流蓄水一千一百多处；并动用了二万一千四百多件提水工具，日夜轮浇秋田。干旱比较严重的大荔县，截止23日，已经灌溉秋田三十一万七千多亩，其中一十八万亩棉田已经全部浇完，有的浇过二次到三次水。
    全省九十个机械厂的工人，也都赶制排灌机械，支援抗旱斗争。据最近统计，他们已经为农村赶制水泵二百多台、锅驼机一万一千多马力、电动机一万四千九百瓩。国营华山机械厂还派人到长安县帮助各人民公社安装、检修排灌设备。
    陕西省自夏收以来，除陕北和关中西部部分地区下过透雨外，其余地区雨量很小，一般只下雨十毫米左右，小河断流，堰塘缺水，大灌渠水量减少；有些秋苗发干变黄，有的稻田水干地裂。针对这些情况，中共陕西省委和省人民委员会曾经数次发出通知，要求全党全民动手，全力以赴，突出地抓抗旱防旱工作。各地在接到这些通知后，立即行动，许多地区的负责干部亲自领导这一工作。但是也有个别地区抗旱防旱工作进展比较迟缓。
    中共陕西省委根据最近旱象发展情况，决定立即在全省掀起一个群众性的抗旱保秋运动高潮。为此24日又发出了紧急指示，要求所有受旱地区要突出地抓灌溉。有水利设施的，不管渠、库、井、塘、堰都要充分用起来，勤浇细浇，日夜抢时轮浇；留有尾工的水利工程，要坚决设法突击抢修；没有灌溉设施的，只要就近有水，就应组织群众担水、泼浇。指示要求各社、队、小队，对有水源和花工少、见效快的小块土地，能变成水地的修一亩是一亩，修一分算一分，尽量扩大灌溉面积。同时还要积极进行锄草保墒，追肥积肥，缺苗的补苗，利用所有小块土地种秋收作物或秋菜。
