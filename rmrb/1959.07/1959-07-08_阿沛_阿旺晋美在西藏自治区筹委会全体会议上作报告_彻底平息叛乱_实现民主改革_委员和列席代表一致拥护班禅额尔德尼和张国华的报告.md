Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, July 7th: The Second Plenary Session of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region continued its general meeting on the afternoon of July 3rd, with Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region, delivering a report on "Several Major Policy Issues in the Current Tasks."

    The reactionary forces in Tibet are continuing to die, and the newborn revolutionary forces are thriving. The central task in Tibet today is to thoroughly eliminate the remaining rebels, fully mobilize the masses, and implement democratic reforms throughout the region.

    Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme began his report by expressing his complete agreement with the two reports made by Acting Chairman Bainqen Erdini and Vice Chairman Zhang Guohua at the meeting on June 28th. He said that the current tasks and several policy principles for the entire Tibet region have been put forward in these two reports. Now, based on the opinions discussed by everyone, he will report to the conference on several major policy issues in the current tasks and ask everyone to discuss them. He then spoke about the basic situation and tasks in Tibet today.

    He said: "Under the instigation of imperialism and foreign interventionists, the original Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group openly launched an armed rebellion betraying the motherland and the people. In this way, they completely exposed their reactionary faces of splitting the unity of the motherland, undermining national unity, opposing reform, and attempting to permanently maintain the serf system in Tibet and continue to exploit and oppress the working people in front of the broad masses of working people."

    He said: "Over the past eight years, the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet and the working personnel have conscientiously implemented the Chinese Communist Party's policies of national equality and unity and freedom of religious belief, protected the interests of the people, and served the people wholeheartedly. Their exemplary behavior has formed a sharp contrast with the crimes of the rebels who killed, set fires, looted property, raped women, and harmed the people, which has profoundly educated the masses, thereby enabling the masses to further recognize that the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army truly represent their interests. The class consciousness of the masses has been significantly improved, the distinction between the enemy and ourselves is very clear, the masses deeply hate the rebels, and warmly support and actively assist the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion."

    Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme said: "Now the bandits have been basically eliminated, and the armed rebellion launched by the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet has suffered a shameful defeat. No matter how imperialism and foreign interventionists cry and howl unreasonably over the failure of the rebellion of the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet, the rebellious Tibetan rebels have been completely abandoned by the Tibetan people. The reactionary forces in Tibet are continuing to die, and the newborn revolutionary forces are thriving. After the rebellion has been basically quelled, the broad masses of working people urgently demand the realization of the democratic reforms they have long yearned for, to break the shackles of the feudal serf system imposed on them, and to live a happy and free life."

    He said: "The feudal serf system in Tibet is the most reactionary, darkest, and most barbaric system. Under this cruel exploitation system, the working people are in a painful situation of hunger, cold, and difficulty day and night, and have no political rights or freedoms. This system seriously shackles social productivity. If it is not reformed, Tibet's social productivity will not be liberated. To develop Tibet's economic and cultural construction undertakings, improve the lives of the working people, and lay the foundation for the Tibetan people to join the people of all nationalities in the motherland on the road to common prosperity and common development of socialism, it is necessary to thoroughly destroy the feudal serf system in Tibet and implement democratic reforms."

    Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme pointed out that the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet, which had always tried its best to oppose reform and finally launched an armed rebellion for this purpose, has already cut itself off from the people and embarked on the road to self-destruction. The broad masses of people are eager to carry out democratic reforms, and the patriotic and progressive people in the upper class also actively support reform; therefore, the conditions for implementing democratic reforms in Tibet are now fully ripe. He said:
  "Carrying out democratic reform is a revolution, but it will be a peaceful revolution."

    Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme pointed out that the central task in Tibet today is to thoroughly eliminate the remaining rebels who have escaped, fully mobilize the masses, and implement democratic reforms throughout Tibet. According to the current situation in Tibet, the democratic reform and socialist transformation in Tibet are carried out in two stages. The democratic reform is divided into two steps. The first step is to carry out the "three antis and two reductions" movement of anti-rebellion, anti-Ula corvee system, anti-slavery, and rent and interest reduction, and the second step is to distribute land. These steps are completely in line with the current actual situation in Tibet, are universally demanded by the broad masses of working people, and are correct.

    He said: "According to the instructions of the central government, a differentiated policy is adopted towards the lords (referring to the original Tibetan local government, monasteries, and the three major lords of the nobility) who participated in the rebellion and those who did not participate in the rebellion. The land of the lords who participated in the rebellion will be confiscated and cultivated by the original farmers. This year, the policy of 'whoever sows, reaps' will be implemented. The land occupied by the lords who did not participate in the rebellion will be subject to rent reduction through consultation this year, and a redemption policy will be adopted during the land reform."

    Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme then spoke about several major policy issues in implementing democratic reforms, including rural work issues, policies for pastoral areas, monastery issues, protection of industry and commerce, protection of foreign merchants who abide by the law, administrative division issues, and redemption policy issues.

    Fully mobilizing the masses, organizing the masses, and carrying out the "three antis and two reductions" movement is the main task of the current rural Tibet. It is necessary to organize farmers' associations with poor and lower-middle peasants as the core, making them the basic organizational form for uniting and educating farmers to carry out production reforms and develop production.

    Regarding rural work issues, he said: The current main task in rural areas is to fully mobilize the masses and organize the masses to carry out the "three antis and two reductions" movement. He said: "The 'three antis' are anti-rebellion, anti-Ula corvee system, and anti-slavery. Rebellion is a serious crime of betraying the motherland, betraying the people, and opposing the revolution, and it must be resolutely opposed and thoroughly quelled; the Ula corvee system places the heaviest burden on the working people and causes great suffering, and it must be declared abolished. The serfs in Tibet belong to different feudal lords, and the serfs do not even have the most basic personal freedom. It is necessary to lift the personal dependence of farmers and herdsmen, liberate farmers and herdsmen, and give them personal freedom. 'Two reductions' are rent reduction and interest reduction. For the land of the lords who did not participate in the rebellion, an 80-20 rent reduction will be implemented this year, that is, the land income, excluding the part for seeds, will be distributed with the landlord getting 20% and the laborer getting 80%. Regarding the issue of interest reduction, some of the high-interest loans given to the working people by the original three major lords and the second landlords are debts of endless generations and joint guarantee debts that farmers can never repay. The general interest rates are very high, and the exploitation of the working people is brutal. All debts owed by the working people to the three major lords and the second landlords before 1958 are declared abolished; commercial debts are not abolished; mutual debts between the working people are generally maintained according to the original agreement. If there are disputes, they should be resolved through consultation and mediation by farmers and herdsmen based on the principle of unity. For new debts given to the working people by the lords who did not participate in the rebellion after 1959, interest reduction will be implemented, and the interest will be calculated at a monthly rate of one percent.

      "The 'self-operated land' of the lords who did not participate in the rebellion is generally cultivated by Langsheng (referring to agricultural slaves who are fed and clothed by the lords) and serfs who have land shares by paying Ula corvee. The personal dependence of Langsheng should be lifted. After Langsheng are liberated, the relationship between them and the manor owner should be changed to an employer-employee relationship, and the lord should pay Langsheng reasonable wages. When is it best to start calculating wages? Please study this issue. The Ula corvee land shares are also handled according to the principle of '80-20 rent reduction'. If the income from the lord's 'self-operated land' cannot solve the wage problem of Langsheng after their personal dependence is lifted and changed to an employer-employee relationship, it can also be solved according to the principle of '80-20 rent reduction'. However, it is necessary to help resettle the lives of Langsheng and not dismiss them casually, making them homeless."

    He said: "In the process of mobilizing the masses, it is necessary to rely on the poor and hired peasants, and at the same time of mobilizing the poor and hired peasants, consolidate the unity of the middle peasants, and unite all those who can be united. Organize farmers' associations with poor and hired peasants as the core on the basis of deeply mobilizing the masses. The current rebellion-suppression production committee is a transitional organization. After the formal establishment of the farmers' association, the rebellion-suppression production committee can be ended, making the farmers' association the basic organizational form for uniting and educating farmers to carry out democratic reforms and develop production. For a certain period of time, the farmers' association will also exercise the functions of rural grassroots political power."

    In pastoral areas, it is definitely necessary to implement a policy of benefiting both livestock and herdsmen, and herd owners and herders. But it is also necessary to launch the "three antis" movement.

    Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme then talked about policies for pastoral areas. He said: "Because animal husbandry production is completely different from agricultural production, according to the current situation in Tibet, the main issues in pastoral areas are protecting livestock and developing animal husbandry production. In pastoral areas, it is definitely necessary to implement a policy of benefiting both livestock and herdsmen, and herd owners and herders. However, rebellions in pastoral areas must be eliminated, and feudal exploitation and oppression of herders by herd owners, as well as feudal systems that are not conducive to the development of animal husbandry production, must be abolished. Therefore, it is also necessary to carry out the "three antis" movement of anti-rebellion, anti-Ula corvee system, and anti-slavery in pastoral areas. After the original pastoral slaves are liberated in the "three antis", they will be changed to a herder-employee relationship, and the herd owner will pay reasonable wages. The grazing of grasslands will still be handled according to the original method, and there should be no disputes. At the same time, it is announced that the system of paying grass head tax to the lords who occupy the grassland and their agents is abolished.

      "Livestock occupied by rebels will be confiscated by the government and owned by the original herders. It is suggested that during this discussion process, some members of the preparatory committee conduct an in-depth investigation in pastoral areas to solicit the opinions of herdsmen, so that this issue can be resolved more realistically.

    "The 'non-breeding, non-dying livestock tax' collected from herdsmen by the original three major lords will be abolished.

    "In the process of carrying out the above tasks, establish herders' associations similar to farmers' associations."

    Within monasteries, it is necessary to carry out anti-rebellion, anti-privilege, and anti-exploitation movements. The land and debts of monasteries that did not participate in the rebellion will also be handled according to the rent and interest reduction policy.

    Regarding monastery issues, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme said: In the past, because the feudal serf owner class used religious monasteries as a tool to rule and oppress the people, the monasteries themselves also formed a complete feudal exploitation system. Monasteries not only occupy manors and exploit the working people, but also have various privileges, oppress and harm the working people. This situation is completely inconsistent with the spirit of the policy of freedom of religious belief stipulated in our country's constitution, and it is also inconsistent with the religious doctrines themselves. At the same time, it is also unfavorable to the monasteries themselves. The Tibetan working people believe in religion and truly love the monasteries, but because the monasteries cruelly exploit and oppress the masses under the guise of religion, the masses also hate the monasteries very much. The internal structure of the monasteries is also strictly hierarchical, and poor lamas are actually slaves in monks' robes. They urgently demand liberation. According to this situation, we believe that it is necessary to carry out anti-rebellion, anti-privilege, and anti-exploitation movements within the monasteries. The land and debts of monasteries that did not participate in the rebellion will also be handled according to the rent and interest reduction policy. After the "two reductions" are implemented, if the monastery's income is not enough to maintain the lives of the lamas in the future, the government will provide subsidies.

    He said: "When implementing the 'three antis and two reductions' in monasteries, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the Chinese Communist Party's and the country's policy of freedom of religious belief, protect patriotic and law-abiding lamas and monasteries, and protect the cultural relics and historical sites in the monasteries."

    Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme said in his report that it is necessary to protect industry and commerce, and protect foreign merchants who abide by our country's laws. Support and develop handicrafts that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood.

    Adjust administrative divisions, planning to divide the entire region into seven special districts, one city, and eighty counties.

    Regarding the issue of administrative divisions, he said: "The past administrative divisions of Jichao, Zong, and Xi in Tibet were divided according to the feudal separatist situation of the three major land occupiers owning manors, etc. They are extremely unreasonable and inconvenient for administrative management. We believe that it is very necessary to adjust the original administrative divisions and re-divide them reasonably according to the conditions of terrain, transportation, economy, national defense, and convenience of administrative management. We plan to divide the entire region into seven special districts and one city, namely Shigatse, Qamdo, Tagong, Lhokha, Gyantse, Nagqu, and Ngari, and Lhasa City. The original 147 Zongxi administrative units will be merged and adjusted into eighty counties."

    The policy of redemption for nobles and second landlords who did not participate in the rebellion is completely correct. We hope that patriotic and progressive people in the upper class will stand on the side of the people.

    Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme finally talked about the issue of redemption policy. He said:
  "The central government has decided to adopt the method of treating the national bourgeoisie in the interior when carrying out democratic reforms, and to carry out redemption for nobles and second landlords who did not participate in the rebellion. We believe that this policy of the central government is completely correct. There are many reasons for implementing the redemption policy. First of all, politically speaking, there is a difference between those who participated in the rebellion and those who did not participate in the rebellion. The land, etc., of the nobles and second landlords who participated in the rebellion will be confiscated, and those who did not participate in the rebellion will be redeemed. In this way, the boundaries are clear, and right and wrong are clear. Secondly, after the peaceful liberation of Tibet, they stood on the anti-imperialist and patriotic position and did some beneficial things for the people; and when the upper-class reactionary group in Tibet launched a full-scale rebellion, they were able to oppose the rebellion together with the people; therefore, in the democratic reform in Tibet, in order to prevent their living standards from being reduced and to ensure their economic life, their land and other means of production will be redeemed. In addition, appropriate arrangements will be made politically, so that people from all levels can happily take the road of democratic reform, which is beneficial to the complete liberation of the working people. At the same time, the state has the conditions and the strength to carry out redemption for those who did not participate in the rebellion."

    Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme said that how to specifically implement the redemption policy remains to be fully discussed at this meeting and opinions should be put forward. The land occupied by monasteries that did not participate in the rebellion will also be redeemed. After the reform, lamas who stay in the monasteries and have difficulties in life will be subsidized by the government according to the specific circumstances.

    Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme finally hoped that patriotic and progressive people in the upper class would support the cause of the complete liberation of the masses and stand on the side of the people.

    Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme's report was constantly interrupted by warm applause.

    From June 29th to the morning of July 3rd, the committee members and observers of the preparatory committee held continuous group meetings to discuss the two reports made by Bainqen Erdini, acting chairman of the preparatory committee, and Zhang Guohua, vice chairman, at the meeting on June 28th. The committee members and representatives unanimously supported these two reports and supported the implementation of democratic reforms in Tibet with the "three antis and two reductions" as the first step, and then the implementation of land reform, in order to completely destroy the dark, cruel, and backward feudal serf system.

    The meeting is still in progress.

    阿沛·阿旺晋美在西藏自治区筹委会全体会议上作报告
    彻底平息叛乱　实现民主改革
    委员和列席代表一致拥护班禅额尔德尼和张国华的报告
    新华社拉萨7日电　西藏自治区筹备委员会第二次全体委员会议3日下午继续举行大会，由自治区筹委会副主任委员兼秘书长阿沛·阿旺晋美作“关于当前任务中几个主要政策问题”的报告。
    西藏反动势力在继续死亡，革命的新生力量在蓬勃发展。西藏当前中心任务是彻底肃清漏网的叛乱分子，充分发动群众，在全区实现民主改革。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美在报告中首先表示完全同意代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼和副主任委员张国华6月28日在会上所作的两个报告。他说，关于西藏全区当前的任务及若干政策原则，在这两个报告中已经提出来了。现在他把当前任务中几个主要政策问题，根据大家协商的意见，向大会报告，请大家讨论。他接着讲了西藏当前的基本形势和任务。
    他说：“在帝国主义和外国干涉者的策动下，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团公开发动了背叛祖国、背叛人民的武装叛乱，这样，他们就把自己分裂祖国统一、破坏民族团结、反对改革，妄想永远保持西藏农奴制度，继续剥削与压迫劳动人民的反动面目，完全暴露在广大劳动人民的面前。”
    他说：“人民解放军驻藏部队和工作人员，在过去八年中认真执行中国共产党的民族平等团结政策和宗教信仰自由政策，保护人民的利益，全心全意为人民服务的模范行为，同叛乱分子杀人放火、抢劫财物、奸淫妇女、残害人民的罪恶行为，形成了鲜明的对比，深刻教育了群众，从而使群众进一步认识到共产党和人民解放军是真正代表他们利益的。群众的阶级觉悟有了显著提高，敌我界限很明确，群众对叛乱分子深恶痛绝，热烈拥护并积极支援人民解放军平息叛乱。”
    阿沛·阿旺晋美说：“现在叛匪已基本肃清，西藏上层反动集团所发动的武装叛乱，遭到了可耻的失败。不管帝国主义和外国干涉者对西藏上层反动集团叛乱的失败如何痛哭流涕，如何无理叫嚣，叛国的西藏叛乱分子已完全被西藏人民唾弃了。西藏的反动势力正在继续死亡下去，革命新生的力量正在蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来。在叛乱基本平息之后，广大劳动人民迫切要求实现他们渴望已久的民主改革，打碎套在他们身上的封建农奴制度的枷锁，过幸福自由的生活。”
    他说：“西藏的封建农奴制度，是最反动、最黑暗、最野蛮的制度，在这种残酷的剥削制度下，劳动人民处于饥寒交迫、日夜难度的痛苦境地，政治上没有任何权利和自由。这个制度严重地束缚着社会生产力，如不改革，西藏的社会生产力就得不到解放。要为发展西藏的经济、文化建设事业，改善劳动人民的生活，为使西藏人民同祖国各民族人民一道，走向共同繁荣、共同发展的社会主义道路建立基础，必须彻底摧毁西藏的封建农奴制度，实行民主改革。”
    阿沛·阿旺晋美指出，过去一直竭力反对改革，最后为此发动武装叛乱的西藏上层反动集团，已经自绝于人民走上了自取灭亡的道路，广大人民迫切要求进行民主改革，而上层中的爱国进步人士也积极赞成改革；因而现在西藏实行民主改革的条件已经完全成熟。他说：
  “进行民主改革，这是一场革命，但这将是一场和平革命。”
    阿沛·阿旺晋美指出，当前西藏的中心任务是彻底肃清漏网的残余叛乱分子，充分发动群众，在西藏全区实现民主改革。根据西藏目前的情况，西藏的民主改革和社会主义改造分成二个阶段进行，民主改革又分为两个步骤，第一步是进行反叛乱、反乌拉差役制度、反奴役和减租减息的“三反双减”运动，第二步是分配土地。这些步骤是完全符合西藏当前的实际情况的，是广大劳动人民所普遍要求的，是正确的。
    他说：“根据中央的指示，对参加叛乱和没有参加叛乱的领主（指原西藏地方政府、寺庙、贵族三大领主），采取区别对待的政策。参加叛乱的领主的土地予以没收，由原耕农民耕种，今年实行‘谁种谁收’的政策。没有参加叛乱的领主占有的土地，经过协商，今年实行减租，土地改革时采取赎买政策。”
    阿沛·阿旺晋美接着讲了实行民主改革中的几个主要政策问题，其中包括农村工作问题、对牧区的政策、寺庙问题、保护工商业、保护遵守法律的外国商人、行政区划问题、赎买政策问题。
    充分发动群众、组织群众，进行“三反双减”运动，是当前西藏农村主要任务。要组织以贫雇农为核心的农会，使它成为团结教育农民进行生产改革、发展生产的基本组织形式。
    关于农村工作问题，他说：当前农村的主要任务是充分发动群众、组织群众，进行“三反双减”运动，他说：“三反”就是反叛乱、反乌拉差役制度、反奴役。叛乱是背叛祖国、背叛人民，反对革命的严重罪恶行为，必须予以坚决反对，彻底平息；乌拉差役制度给予劳动人民的负担最重，痛苦很大，必须明令宣布废除。西藏的农奴，都分别属于不同的封建领主，农奴连最起码的人身自由都没有。必须解除农牧民的人身依附，解放农牧民，使他们获得人身自由。‘双减’是减租减息。没有参加叛乱的领主的土地，今年实行二八减租，即把土地收入除去种子以外的部分，按地主得二分、劳动者得八分予以分配。减息问题，原来三大领主及二地主放给劳动人民的高利贷，其中有些是农民永远还不清的子孙债和联保债等，一般的利息都很高，对劳动人民的剥削惨重。1958年以前劳动人民欠三大领主及二地主等的债务，一律宣布废除；商业债务不废；劳动人民之间互相的债务，一般维持原约规定，如有纠纷，应本团结原则由农（牧）民协商调解处理。没有参加叛乱的领主，1959年以后放给劳动人民的新债，实行减息，利息按月利一分计算。
      “没有参加叛乱的领主的‘自营地’，一般都是由朗生（指领主管吃穿的农业奴隶）和领有份地的农奴支乌拉差役耕种。应当解除朗生的人身依附，朗生获得解放后，同庄园主之间的关系，改变为雇工关系，由领主发给朗生合理的工资。工资从何时起计算为好，请大家研究。乌拉差役的份地同样按‘二八减租’的原则处理。如果解除朗生的人身依附，并且改为雇工关系后，领主‘自营地’的收入不能解决朗生的工资问题时，也可按‘二八减租’的原则解决。但必须帮助安置朗生的生活，不得随便解雇，使他们流离失所。”
    他说：“在发动群众的过程中，一定要依靠贫雇农，并且在发动贫雇农的同时，巩固地团结中农，同时要团结一切可以团结的人。在深入发动群众的基础上组织以贫雇农为核心的农会。目前的平叛生产委员会是过渡性的组织，正式建立农会之后，可以结束平叛生产委员会，使农会成为团结教育农民进行民主改革、发展生产的基本组织形式。在一定时期内，农会又代行农村基层政权的职权。”
    在牧区肯定要实行不分牲畜和牧主牧工两利的政策。但是同样要展开“三反”运动。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美接着谈到了对牧区的政策，他说：“由于牧业生产完全不同于农业生产，根据西藏当前的情况，在牧区主要是保护牲畜和发展牧业生产的问题。在牧区肯定要实行不分牲畜和牧主牧工两利的政策。但是牧区的叛乱必须肃清，牧主对牧工的封建剥削压迫以及不利于发展牧业生产的封建制度必须废除。因此在牧区同样要开展反对叛乱、反对乌拉差役制度、反对奴役的“三反”运动。“三反”中原牧奴解放后，改为牧工关系，由牧主发给合理工资。对草场的放牧使用，仍按原来的办法处理，不得有纠纷，同时宣布废除向草场占有者的领主及其代理人等交纳草头税的制度。
      “叛乱分子占有的牲畜，由政府没收，归原牧放者所有。建议在这次讨论过程中，由筹委会部分委员深入牧区调查一次，征求牧民的意见，以便使这一问题解决得更切合实际情况。
    “原三大领主要牧民交纳的‘不生不死的牲畜税’，予以废除。
    “在执行上述任务的过程中，成立与农民协会相同的牧民协会。”
    在寺庙内必须开展反叛乱、反特权、反剥削运动，对未参加叛乱的寺庙土地和债务也按减租减息政策处理。
    关于寺庙问题，阿沛·阿旺晋美说：过去由于封建农奴主阶级利用宗教寺庙，做为统治压迫人民的一种工具，使寺庙本身也形成了一套完整的封建剥削制度。寺庙不仅占有庄园，剥削劳动人民，而且还拥有各种特权，压迫和残害劳动人民。这种情况完全不符合我国宪法规定的宗教信仰自由政策的精神，也不符合宗教本身的教义，同时对寺庙本身也不利。藏族劳动人民信仰宗教，也真正爱护寺庙，但由于寺庙披着宗教外衣，惨酷地剥削压迫群众，群众又非常痛恨寺庙。寺庙内部也是等级森严，贫苦喇嘛实际上是穿着僧装的奴隶，他们迫切要求解放。根据这种情况，我们认为在寺庙内必须开展反叛乱、反特权、反剥削的运动。对未参加叛乱的寺庙土地和债务也按减租减息政策处理，实行“双减”后，寺庙今后收入不足维持喇嘛生活时，由政府予以补助。
    他说：“在寺庙实行‘三反双减’时，必须认真贯彻执行中国共产党和国家的宗教信仰自由政策，保护爱国守法的喇嘛寺庙，保护寺庙内的文物古迹。”
    阿沛·阿旺晋美在报告中说，要保护工商业，保护遵守我国法律的外国商人。对有利于国计民生的手工业，予以扶持发展。
    调整行政区划，拟将全区划分为七个专区，一个市，八十个县。
    关于行政区划问题，他说：“西藏过去基巧、宗、溪等行政区划，是按三大领土占有庄园等封建割据情况而划分的，极不合理，又不便于行政上的管理。我们认为根据地形、交通、经济、国防、便于行政管理等条件，对原有的行政区划加以调整，重新合理划分，是非常必要的。我们拟将全区划为七个专区，一个市，即日喀则、昌都、塔工、山南、江孜、黑河、阿里等七个专区和拉萨市。原有的一百四十七个宗溪行政单位，合并调整为八十个县。”
    对没有参加叛乱的贵族及二地主实行赎买的政策，是完全正确的。希望上层爱国进步人士站到人民方面来。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美最后谈到了赎买政策问题，他说：
  “中央决定在进行民主改革时，对没有参加叛乱的贵族及二地主采取像内地对待民族资产阶级的办法，进行赎买。我们认为中央的这个政策是完全正确的。实行赎买政策是有许多理由的。首先在政治上说，参加叛乱的和没有参加叛乱的有所区别。对参加叛乱的贵族及二地主的土地等实行没收，对没有参加叛乱者实行赎买。这样，就界线清楚，是非明确。其次，他们在西藏和平解放后，站在反帝爱国的立场上，对人民作了一些有益的事情；而在西藏上层反动集团发动全面叛乱的时候，他们又能和人民一道反对叛乱；因此在西藏实行民主改革中，为了使他们的生活水平不致降低，经济上生活有保证，对他们的土地等生产资料实行赎买。另外，在政治上也予以适当安排，这样使上层人士都能愉快地走民主改革的道路，这对于劳动人民的彻底解放是有利的。同时，国家对没有参加叛乱的进行赎买，也是有条件和有力量的。”
    阿沛·阿旺晋美说，关于如何具体执行赎买政策，尚待这次会议充分加以讨论，提出意见。没有参加叛乱的寺庙占有土地的，同样实行赎买。在改革后对留住寺庙的喇嘛，生活上有困难的，按照具体情况，由政府加以贴补。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美最后希望上层爱国进步人士支持群众彻底解放的事业，站在人民方面来。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美的报告不断为热烈的掌声所打断。
    6月29日到7月3日上午，筹委会的委员和列席代表连续举行小组会，讨论了筹委会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼和副主任委员张国华在6月28日会议上的两个报告。委员和代表们一致拥护这两个报告，拥护在西藏实行以“三反双减”为第一步内容的民主改革，然后实行土地改革，以便彻底摧毁黑暗、残酷、落后的封建农奴制度。
    会议仍在继续进行。
