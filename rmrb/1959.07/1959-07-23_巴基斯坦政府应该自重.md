The Pakistani Government Should Respect Itself

Recently, some things have happened in Pakistan that have made the Chinese people feel very regretful and indignant. From June 29th to July 5th, a delegation led by a "Lieutenant General" of the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique, masquerading as a "Chinese Muslim Pilgrimage Delegation," openly engaged in activities in Karachi to slander China and undermine Sino-Pakistani relations, with the permission and connivance of the Pakistani government. The Pakistani Foreign Minister even personally received this "delegation" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique on July 4th. This practice of the Pakistani government is obviously intended to obliterate China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, damage the dignity of the Chinese people, and further follow the United States in creating a "two Chinas" conspiracy. This is an extremely unfriendly and serious provocation to the Chinese people and the Chinese government.

The Pakistani government openly treated the so-called "delegation" of the Chiang Kai-shek clique as "honored guests" and condoned their anti-China activities on Pakistani territory. Is this an isolated, accidental event? Absolutely not. Although the Pakistani government established diplomatic relations with China in 1951, it has adopted an unfriendly attitude towards China on many issues. At the 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th United Nations General Assemblies, the Pakistani representatives voted with the United States every time against discussing the issue of China's representation. Especially in recent years, in order to follow the United States in creating the "two Chinas" conspiracy, the Pakistani government's dealings with the Chiang Kai-shek clique have become increasingly frequent. Pakistan once sent people to participate in the "Asian People's Anti-Communist League" conference held in Taiwan. In March 1958, Pakistan even condoned Chiang gang secret agent, Bugra, to conduct anti-China activities in several major cities in Pakistan. At the same time, the leaders of the Pakistani government have, on many occasions, openly denied China's territorial sovereignty over Taiwan, referring to Taiwan as a "country" or comparing Taiwan with "mainland China." When the United States created tension in the Taiwan Strait area in the autumn of 1958, the Pakistani government sent a note to our country, actually saying that the legal status of the sovereignty of Taiwan and Penghu was "unclear." It can be seen that the Pakistani government has been following the United States in the conspiracy to create "two Chinas," echoing every step. And the recent events show that since the Ayub government came to power, the Pakistani government's attitude of following the United States in creating "two Chinas" and being hostile to the Chinese people has become increasingly worse.

We must also solemnly point out the extremely unfriendly attitude taken by the Ayub government on the issue of Tibet in China. During April and May, that is, after the Chinese people put down the rebellion launched by a small number of reactionary elements in Tibet, which is their own territory, the Pakistani Foreign Minister and other responsible officials babbled incessantly at home and abroad to slander the Chinese people, interfere in China's internal affairs, provoke relations between China and India, and vigorously promote the Cold War atmosphere. They wantonly slandered the Chinese people's suppression of the rebellion in Tibet as "aggression," "brutal suppression," and "communist-style imperialism." Pakistani government officials and right-wing newspapers have even deliberately spread the so-called Chinese "threat" to Southeast Asian countries, and that the Tibet incident "emphasized the necessity of regional defense treaties or collective defense treaties," and so on. Thus, while the US imperialists openly demanded that Pakistan and India jointly oppose China, Pakistani President Ayub personally came forward to demand that India establish a "joint defense alliance" with Pakistan. As everyone knows, this activity of the Pakistani government did not achieve its intended purpose due to the opposition of the Indian and Pakistani people and the condemnation of just public opinion in Asian countries. However, it is not difficult for people to see from this what a wicked role the ruling group of Pakistan has played.

The Pakistani government's recent intensification of following the United States in creating "two Chinas" and being hostile to the Chinese people is inseparable from its entire foreign policy. Since the Ayub government came to power last year, the Pakistani government has implemented a policy of further leaning towards the United States. Originally, between 1954 and 1955, Pakistan had successively joined the "US-Pakistan Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement," the Southeast Asia Treaty, and the Baghdad Treaty. But still feeling it was not enough, in March of this year, Pakistan signed a bilateral military agreement with the United States. According to this agreement, the United States can use armed forces in Pakistan and can establish missile bases in Pakistan, which further turns Pakistan into a military springboard for the United States in the Southeast Asian region. The signing of this agreement seriously threatened the security of the Soviet Union, China, India, Afghanistan, and other Asian countries, and aggravated the tense situation in this region. The signing of this agreement also further consolidated the United States' control over Pakistan, making Pakistan even more obedient to the policies of the US aggressive bloc. This policy of the ruling group of Pakistan to lean towards the United States is fundamentally contrary to the interests of peace in Asia and the national interests of Pakistan. Therefore, whether in Pakistan domestically or in the entire Asia, the result of implementing this policy will only put itself in an isolated position.

The various activities of the Pakistani government in following the United States and being hostile to the Chinese people cannot but arouse great indignation among the Chinese people. The Chinese people have always valued the friendly relations between the Chinese and Pakistani people and patiently waited for the Pakistani government's attitude to change. In the past, our government has lodged protests and made sincere advice to the Pakistani government through diplomatic channels several times, avoiding public criticism and accusations. However, the Pakistani government has not only failed to pay attention to our government's protests and advice but has instead intensified its efforts to serve the US aggressive policy of creating "two Chinas," and has even openly condoned Chiang Kai-shek clique elements to engage in anti-China activities using Pakistani territory. Is this something the Chinese people can tolerate?

Both China and Pakistan are participants in the Bandung Conference. The Chinese government has always conscientiously implemented the principles of the Bandung resolutions. The Chinese government has never and will never participate in any activities that infringe on Pakistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity, create "two Pakistans," or interfere in Pakistan's internal affairs. The Chinese government has never and will never plan a military alliance against the Pakistani people, or provoke relations between the Pakistani people and the people of other Southeast Asian countries. The Chinese government has always been willing to maintain and develop friendly relations with Pakistan based on the Bandung principles. We have been doing this for many years. However, it is regrettable that although the Pakistani government has also stated that it is willing to maintain friendly relations with China based on the Bandung principles, the facts are not so. The extremely unfriendly attitude currently adopted towards the People's Republic of China by the Pakistani government cannot but affect the development of normal relations between China and Pakistan. The Pakistani government should rein in its horses, abandon its attitude of hostility towards the Chinese people, and return to the path of abiding by the Bandung resolutions, and return to the path of friendship between China and Pakistan. Otherwise, as pointed out in the protest note of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on July 21, "If the Pakistani side continues to engage in words and deeds that harm China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as has been the case recently, then the Pakistani government must bear full responsibility for all damage caused to Sino-Pakistani relations as a result."

### 巴基斯坦政府应该自重

    巴基斯坦政府应该自重
    最近期间，在巴基斯坦发生了一些使中国人民感到十分遗憾和愤慨的事情。从6月29日到7月5日，一个由台湾蒋介石集团的“陆军中将”所率领的、冒称“中国回教朝觐团”的代表团，竟在巴基斯坦政府的允许和纵容下，到卡拉奇公开进行诬蔑中国和破坏中巴关系的活动。巴基斯坦外交部长居然在7月4日亲自接见了蒋介石集团的这个“代表团”。巴基斯坦政府的这种做法，显然是存心要抹煞中国的主权和领土完整，损害中国人民的尊严，进一步追随美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋。这是对中国人民和中国政府的极不友好的严重挑衅。
    巴基斯坦政府公然对蒋介石集团的所谓“代表团”以“上宾”相待，并纵容他们在巴基斯坦的国土上进行反对中国的活动，难道这是孤立的、偶然的事件吗？绝对不是。巴基斯坦政府虽然自1951年以来就同中国建立了外交关系，但是它在许多问题上都对中国采取不友好的态度。在第九、第十、第十一、第十二和第十三届联合国大会上，巴基斯坦代表每一次都跟着美国投票反对讨论关于中国代表权的问题。特别是近年来，巴基斯坦政府为了追随美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋，同蒋介石集团的来往，日益频繁。巴基斯坦曾经派人参加在台湾举行的“亚洲人民反共同盟”的会议。1958年3月，巴基斯坦竟纵容蒋帮特务分子布格拉在巴基斯坦几个大城市进行反对中国人民的活动。同时，巴基斯坦政府的负责人曾经在许多场合，公然否认中国对台湾的领土主权，把台湾称为“国家”，或者把台湾和“大陆中国”相提并论。当1958年秋，美国在中国台湾海峡地区制造紧张局势的时候，巴基斯坦政府又照会我国，居然说什么台湾和澎湖主权问题的法律地位“是不清楚的”。可见，巴基斯坦政府在制造“两个中国”的阴谋活动中，是跟着美国随梆唱影，亦步亦趋的。而最近的事件表明，自从阿尤布政府上台以来，巴基斯坦政府追随美国制造“两个中国”和敌视中国人民的态度，更是越来越坏了。
    我们也不能不严正地指出阿尤布政府在中国西藏问题上所采取的极不友好的态度。在4月到5月期间，即在中国人民在自己领土西藏平定了一小撮反动分子所发动的叛乱之后，巴基斯坦的外交部长和其他负责官员，竟在国内和国外喋喋不休地诬蔑中国人民，干涉中国内政，挑拨中国和印度的关系，大肆鼓动冷战空气。他们恣意谩骂中国人民在西藏平定叛乱是“侵略”，是“残酷镇压”，是“共产主义式的帝国主义”。巴基斯坦政府官员和右翼报刊更别有用心地极力散布所谓中国“威胁”了东南亚国家，所谓西藏事件“强调了区域性防卫条约或集体防卫条约的必要性”等等言论。于是，在美帝国主义者公开要求巴基斯坦和印度共同反华的同时，巴基斯坦总统阿尤布就亲自出面要求印度同巴基斯坦建立“共同防御联盟”。大家知道，巴基斯坦政府的这个活动，由于印度人民和巴基斯坦人民的反对，由于亚洲各国公正舆论的谴责，没有达到预期的目的。但是，人们由此不难看出，巴基斯坦的统治集团已经扮演了何等邪恶的角色。
    巴基斯坦政府最近期间加紧追随美国制造“两个中国”和敌视中国人民，是同它的整个外交政策分不开的。自从去年阿尤布政府上台以来，巴基斯坦政府实行了进一步投靠美国的政策。本来，在1954到1955年间，巴基斯坦已经先后参加了“美巴共同防御援助协定”、东南亚条约和巴格达条约。但是，还嫌不够，今年3月，巴基斯坦又同美国签订了双边军事协定。根据这个协定，美国可以在巴基斯坦使用武装部队，并可以在巴基斯坦建立导弹基地，这就更加把巴基斯坦变为美国在东南亚地区的军事跳板。这个协定的签订，严重地威胁了苏联、中国、印度、阿富汗以及其他亚洲国家的安全，加剧了这个地区的紧张局势。这个协定的签订，也更加巩固了美国对巴基斯坦的控制，使巴基斯坦更加听命于美国侵略集团的政策。巴基斯坦统治集团这种投靠美国的政策，是根本违反亚洲的和平利益和巴基斯坦的民族利益的，因此，不论在巴基斯坦国内，还是在整个亚洲，执行这种政策的结果只会使自己处于孤立地位。
    巴基斯坦政府追随美国，敌视中国人民的种种活动，当然不能不引起中国人民的极大愤慨。中国人民一向以中巴两国人民的友好关系为重，耐心等待巴基斯坦政府的态度能够有所改变。过去我国政府几次通过外交途径向巴基斯坦政府提出抗议和忠告，避免公开进行批评和指责。但是，巴基斯坦政府对于我国政府的抗议和忠告，不仅没有加以重视，反而变本加厉地为美国制造“两个中国”的侵略政策服务，甚至公然纵容蒋介石集团分子利用巴基斯坦国土从事反华活动。难道这是中国人民能够容忍的吗？
    中国和巴基斯坦都是万隆会议的参加国。中国政府一贯认真执行万隆决议的原则。中国政府从来没有也不会去参加任何侵犯巴基斯坦主权和领土完整的活动，去制造什么“两个巴基斯坦”，去干涉巴基斯坦内政。中国政府从来没有也不会去策划反对巴基斯坦人民的军事联盟，去挑拨巴基斯坦人民同东南亚其他各国人民的关系。中国政府一向愿意根据万隆原则同巴基斯坦保持和发展友好关系。多年以来我们也就是这样做的。但是，很遗憾，巴基斯坦政府虽然也曾经表示它是愿意根据万隆原则保持同中国的友好关系，而事实却并非如此。巴基斯坦政府目前对中华人民共和国所采取的极不友好的态度，不能不影响到中巴两国正常关系的发展。巴基斯坦政府应当悬崖勒马，放弃敌视中国人民的态度，回到遵守万隆决议的道路上来，回到中巴两国友好的道路上来。否则正像我国外交部7月21日的抗议照会所指出的：“如果在巴基斯坦方面仍然像最近这样一再出现有损中国主权和领土完整的言行，那么对于中巴关系因此所受到的一切损害，都必须由巴基斯坦政府负完全责任。”
