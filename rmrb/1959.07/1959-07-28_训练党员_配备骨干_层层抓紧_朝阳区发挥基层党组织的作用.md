    Chaoyang District Brings into Play the Role of Grassroots Party Organizations
    (Our Dispatch) How should suburban district committees and county committees strengthen their leadership over rural grassroots Party organizations to better bring into play the role of grassroots organizations as fighting fortresses? The Chaoyang District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing has recently explored preliminary experiences in this regard.
    In the Great Leap Forward last year, the grassroots Party organizations in most areas of Chaoyang District, Beijing, were further developed, consolidated, and improved, thus fully playing a core leadership role in agricultural production. However, some areas, under the pretext of busy production tasks, relaxed the work of Party organizations for a time. In some places, when assigning tasks, they often adopted a one-size-fits-all meeting approach. As a result, Party branches and members were not clear in their thinking and did not know how to play their roles; in some places, there were many new Party members who were enthusiastic and commendable, but lacked basic Party knowledge, and similarly felt like a "water buffalo dropped into a well," having strength but unable to use it. This weakened the leading role of rural grassroots Party organizations.
    In view of the above situation, the Chaoyang District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has taken a series of effective measures since last winter and this spring to strengthen the leadership of rural grassroots Party organizations, and has achieved preliminary results. At present, most rural branches in this district can play their due role, and Party organizational life and other activities are relatively regular. Among them, eighty-one branches in the four communes of Heping, Zhongde, Shuangqiao, and Gaobeidian can generally adhere to criticism and self-criticism. In the past, the Leijiaqiao branch of Heping Commune, where Party work was relatively backward, has now become an advanced branch, and production and various tasks have greatly improved.
    In strengthening the activities of grassroots Party organizations, the Chaoyang District Committee first paid attention to universally holding Party member training classes, and conducted education for Party members and some non-Party activists on socialism, communism, basic Party knowledge, how to be a Communist Party member, the basic tasks of the Party in rural areas, and so on. In the past six months, they have adopted the method of helping communes hold training classes in batches and in stages, and have successively opened eight Party member training classes, with each training period lasting about a week to half a month. So far, they have trained eight hundred and eighty Party members and more than four hundred activists, and most of the brigade branch secretaries and brigade cadres have received training. After returning from training, many Party members further played the role of Party members and strengthened the ties between the Party and the masses. After returning, Li Fengming, a Party member of Balidian Commune, actively led the masses to deep-plow the land, and production efficiency increased more than twofold. After returning, Ren Baoshan, a Party member and cadre of Gaobeidian Commune, whose working style was somewhat rigid in the past, consulted with the masses in everything he did. The masses reflected: These people are different from before, they are really our good examples.
    Paying attention to equipping the backbone force of branches is another effective measure taken by the Chaoyang District Committee. In the past, the backbone force of some branches in this district was relatively weak. In many places, the production team leader concurrently served as the branch secretary, and in some places, two to four production teams formed a joint branch. In this way, a production team leader not only managed the branch work of his own team, but also often had to manage the branch work of two to four teams. With so many concurrent positions, it was difficult to do all the work well. This time, the District Committee adopted the method of promoting a group from below, cultivating a group from the original backbone, and transferring a group from the commune, and equipped more than one hundred and seventy full-time branch secretaries in the district. Generally, a separate branch was established for each production team that met the conditions for establishing a branch. This created extremely favorable conditions for strengthening branch work. Yang Xiqin, the secretary of the Second Production Team branch of Heping Commune, used to concurrently serve as the production team leader. She was busy with production tasks and never had much time to manage branch work, which affected branch work to some extent. Now that her concurrent position has been resolved, she wholeheartedly considers branch work, strengthens the political and ideological education of Party members, and promotes production.
    The Chaoyang District Committee also adopted the method of one level grasping another, and each level grasping tightly, to strengthen the leadership of grassroots Party organizations. In addition to generally holding meetings to assign organizational work tasks, the Organization Department of the District Committee also paid attention to inspecting, supervising, and helping to solve specific problems for the Organization Department of the Commune Party Committee. The Minister of the Organization Department of the Commune Party Committee reported the situation, problems, and experiences in the grassroots organizational work to the Organization Department of the District Committee once a month. If there were any problems, the Organization Department of the District Committee helped to solve them at any time. This spring, the Organization Department of the District Committee discovered that the organizational life of some Party organizations was not normal, so it helped to summarize and promote the experience of Heping Commune in adhering to Party organizational life, so that the organizational life of these branches could also be maintained. When important issues were encountered in the report, the Secretary of the District Committee also personally participated, which not only made the problem better solved, but also made everyone further attach importance to the grassroots organizational work of the Party ideologically.

### 训练党员  配备骨干  层层抓紧  朝阳区发挥基层党组织的作用

    训练党员  配备骨干  层层抓紧
    朝阳区发挥基层党组织的作用
    本报讯　城市郊区区委和县委如何加强对农村党的基层组织的领导，以更好地发挥基层组织的战斗堡垒作用？中共北京市朝阳区委最近在这方面摸索出初步经验。
    北京市朝阳区绝大部分地区在去年大跃进中，基层党组织有了进一步发展、巩固和提高，因而在农业生产中充分发挥了核心领导作用。但是，也有部分地区一度借口生产任务繁忙，放松了党组织的工作。有些地方在布置任务时，常常采取一揽子会议的办法。因此，党支部和党员思想不明确，不知道怎样发挥作用；有些地方新党员较多，这些同志往往是热情可喜，但是缺乏党的基础知识，同样感到自己是“水牛掉在井里”，有劲没法使。这就无形中削弱了农村基层党组织的领导作用。
    中共朝阳区委会鉴于上述情况，去冬今春以来，就先后采取一系列有效措施，加强对农村基层党组织的领导，已经获得初步效果。目前，这个区大多数农村支部都能发挥应有的作用，党内组织生活等活动也比较经常。其中和平、中德、双桥、高碑店四个公社的八十一个支部，一般都能经常坚持批评和自我批评。过去，党的工作比较落后的和平公社雷家桥支部，现在已经成为先进支部，生产和各项工作都大有起色。
    中共朝阳区委在加强基层党组织的活动中，首先注意普遍举办党员训练班，向党员和部分非党积极分子，进行了社会主义、共产主义、党的基础知识、怎样做一个共产党员、党在农村的基本任务等等教育。半年来，他们采取帮助公社分期分批举办的办法，先后开了八次党员训练班，每期训练时间，大约一个星期到半个月。到目前为止，已经训练了八百八十名党员，四百多名积极分子，所有大队支部书记和大队干部大都受到了训练。许多党员受训回去后，进一步发挥了党员的作用，密切了党和群众的联系。八里店公社党员李凤鸣回去后，积极带领群众深翻土地，生产效率提高一倍以上。过去工作作风有些生硬的高碑店公社党员干部任宝善回去后，不管干什么事，都和群众商量。群众反映：这些人比以前不一样了，真是咱们的好榜样。
    注意配备支部骨干力量，是朝阳区委采取的另一有效措施。过去这个区有些支部的骨干力量比较薄弱，许多地方是生产队长兼支部书记，有些地方更是两个到四个生产队成立一个联合支部。这样，一个生产队长不仅管本队的支部工作，还常常要管两个到四个队的支部工作。兼职一多，就很难把各项工作都做好。这次，区委会采取从下面提拔一批、从原有骨干中培养一批、从公社下放一批的办法，在全区配备了一百七十多个专职支部书记，是凡有条件成立支部的生产队一般都单独成立了支部。这就给加强支部工作创造了极为有利的条件。和平公社第二生产队支部书记杨?琴过去兼生产队长，生产任务忙，总是没有多少时间管支部工作，支部工作因此受了些影响。现在解决了她的兼职问题以后，她全心全意考虑支部工作，加强了对党员的政治思想教育，推动了生产。
    中共朝阳区委还采取一层抓一层、层层抓得紧的办法加强对基层党组织的领导。区委组织部对公社党委组织部除一般开会布置组织工作任务以外，还注意检查、督促、帮助解决具体问题。公社党委组织部长每一个月向区委组织部汇报一次基层组织工作中的情况、问题和经验。如有问题，区委组织部就随时帮助解决。今年春天，区委组织部发现有些地方党组织的组织生活不正常，就帮助总结推广了和平公社坚持过党组织生活的经验，从而使这些支部的组织生活也能坚持。在汇报中，遇有重要问题时，区委书记还亲自参加，这就不仅使问题解决得更好，而且使大家更进一步从思想上重视党的基层组织工作。
