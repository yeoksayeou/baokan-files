    To Increase Buds and Protect Bolls
    July and August are the peak season for cotton flowering and boll formation. Seizing this period to strengthen cotton field management, focusing on increasing fertilizer application and pest control, is an effective measure to achieve increased bud formation and boll protection.
    Cotton requires the most nutrients during the peak flowering and boll formation period. The base fertilizer applied in cotton fields simply cannot meet the needs of cotton during this period, so it is necessary to apply additional topdressing fertilizer before the hot season to effectively promote more flowering, less shedding, and more summer bolls. To ensure that all cotton fields are universally topdressed once before the hot season, all cotton-producing areas should immediately mobilize the masses to launch a crash program of manure accumulation and application, accumulating and applying fertilizer simultaneously. After the start of the hot season, constant attention should be paid to accumulating and producing fertilizer to prepare sufficient fertilizer for topdressing during the summer and for autumn bolls.
    To solve the problem of topdressing cotton fields, it is first necessary to eliminate the negative thinking among some cadres and commune members that there is no fertilizer to accumulate or apply. Now is a great time to compost and create fertilizer, with a large amount of green grass and straw from summer crops available for use. As long as the masses are fully mobilized and all available fertilizer sources are vigorously tapped, there will be plenty to do, not a lack of fertilizer to accumulate. At the same time, although the supply of chemical fertilizer is relatively small this year, in order to concentrate its use and give it a greater effect, it has been decided that chemical fertilizer should be mainly used for cotton fields and other important cash crops. By earnestly implementing this policy, there will still be a considerable amount of chemical fertilizer available for topdressing cotton fields.
    According to materials from several major cotton-producing areas such as Hebei and Henan, insect pests during the bud and boll stage have appeared earlier and are more widespread this year, which poses a major threat to cotton bud and boll protection. Experience has shown that the best time to control bollworms and other pests during the bud and boll stage is to spray pesticides in a concentrated manner during the incubation and early larval stages, eliminating them before they cause harm. From now until the hot summer season, it is the breeding season for various pests, so it is necessary to strengthen pest forecasting and reporting, and mobilize the masses according to the pest situation to eliminate pests in an organized and planned manner. Pest control requires a sufficient supply of pesticides. To solve the problem of pesticide shortages, in addition to using both indigenous and foreign methods and giving full play to the role of indigenous pesticides and methods, local agricultural departments must closely cooperate with commercial departments to promptly adjust surpluses and shortages based on the pest situation and pesticide reserves. In the use of pesticides, it is necessary to save pesticides and overcome the idea of "hoarding" pesticides, grasping the favorable timing of pesticide application to give pesticides a greater effect.
    Last year, rich experience was created in cotton field management, which paved the way for improving cotton planting techniques and striving for a continued great leap forward in cotton production this year. As long as we fully mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, actively exploit favorable factors, overcome unfavorable factors, and launch a movement to strengthen cotton field management on the basis of summarizing and promoting last year's experience, it will play a major role in striving for a continued increase in cotton production this year.

    为了增蕾保桃
    7、8月份是棉花开花结桃的盛期。抓紧这个时期，加强以增施肥料和防治虫害为中心的棉田管理，是达到增蕾保桃的有效措施。
    棉花在开花结桃盛期，需要养料最多。棉田所施基肥根本不能满足这个时期棉花的需要，必须在伏前增施追肥，才能有效地促进伏期多开花、少脱落、多结伏桃。要使全部棉田在入伏以前普遍追肥一次，各个产棉区应立即发动群众，突击积肥，随积随施。入伏后，还要经常注意积肥造肥，为棉田伏期追肥和秋桃追肥准备足够的肥料。
    要解决棉田追肥问题，首先要消除在一部分干部和社员中存在的无肥可积、无肥可施的消极思想。目前正是沤肥造肥大好时机，有大量青草和夏收作物的秸秆可以利用。只要充分发动群众，大力挖掘一切可以利用的肥源，就不是无肥可积，而是大有可为。同时，今年化肥的供应量虽然较少，但是为了集中使用，发挥更大肥效，因而规定了化肥重点用于棉田和其他重要经济作物的方针。切实贯彻这一方针，也还有相当数量的化肥可供棉田追肥用。
    根据河北、河南等几个主要产棉区的材料，今年蕾铃期害虫发生的较早，发生的地区也较普遍，这对棉花保蕾保桃是个重大威胁。经验证明，防治棉铃虫等蕾铃期害虫的有利时机，最好是在孵化期和幼龄期突击喷药，歼灭在为害之前。从现在起直到暑伏时期，正是各种害虫的滋生季节，必须加强虫情预测预报，根据虫情发动群众，有组织、有计划地消灭虫害，防治虫害，需要有足够的农药。解决农药不足问题，除了要土洋并举，充分发挥土药土法的作用外；各地农业部门必须与商业部门密切协作，根据虫情和农药储备情况，及时进行余缺调剂。在农药的使用上，既要节约用药，又须克服“惜药”思想，掌握用药的有利时机，使农药发挥更大效能。
    去年在棉田管理上创造了丰富的经验，这为今年改进植棉技术，力争棉花继续大跃进开辟了道路。只要充分发动群众，依靠群众，积极发挥有利因素，克服不利因素，在总结和推广去年经验的基础上，开展一个加强棉田管理运动，对争取今年棉花继续增产有重大作用。
