Editorial Notes

    "Wick Trimming"

The Fifty Mile Shop Party Branch of the Jiekou Commune in Tianshui City is doing a good job of political and ideological work. In addition to conducting systematic socialist education for Party members and commune members, they pay special attention to using fact comparisons, living examples, combining individual and collective assistance, and combining praise and criticism to conduct education, which has achieved remarkable results.

    Now, most grassroots Party organizations attach importance to political and ideological work, but some comrades believe that they are too busy with production tasks to have time for political and ideological work. This is wrong. The experience of the Fifty Mile Shop Party Branch fully illustrates that the busier and more arduous the task, the more important it is to do a good job of political and ideological work. Only after doing a good job of political and ideological work can the masses understand why they should do it and how to do it, thereby greatly giving play to their subjective initiative, overcoming difficulties, and completing tasks. "A lamp does not shine brightly if its wick is not trimmed." We must do a good job of "wick trimming."

    “拨灯”
    天水市耤口公社五十里铺党支部政治思想工作做得好。他们除对党员和社员进行系统的社会主义教育以外，特别注意用事实对比、活人活事、个别帮助与集体帮助相结合、表扬与批评相结合的办法进行教育，收到显著效果。
    现在，大部分基层党组织都比较重视政治思想工作，但也有一些同志以为，生产任务忙，没有时间做政治思想工作。这是不对的。五十里铺党支部的经验充分说明了，任务越繁忙越艰巨，就越要做好政治思想工作。只有在做好政治思想工作以后，群众才能懂得为什么要这样做、怎样做的道理，从而大大发挥自己的主观能动作用，克服困难，完成任务。“灯不拨不明”，我们要做好“拨灯”工作。
