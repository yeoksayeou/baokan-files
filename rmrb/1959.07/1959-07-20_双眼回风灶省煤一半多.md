Title: Double-Eyed Return Air Stove Saves More Than Half the Coal

The Fuxian County is vigorously promoting the "Double-Eyed Return Air Stove." According to incomplete statistics, 486 of these stoves have been implemented in rural communes throughout the county, with very good results. After the Yangtun canteen in the Delisi Management Area switched to using the return air stove, the average coal consumption dropped from two jin per person per day to half a jin. Cooking time decreased from two and a half hours to forty minutes, saving 160 yuan in food expenses each month.

The double-eyed return air stove has strong firepower due to the full utilization of "ground wind" and the chimney's draft to aid combustion. Furthermore, because the grate bar is in the front of the pot bottom, the fire is drawn back by the chimney's draft and hits the belly of the pot, increasing the heating area of the pot bottom. Also, because the furnace door (coal inlet) is small and the two smoke outlets are appropriately placed, it doesn't choke with smoke or spew fire. This type of stove does not require blowing equipment, can burn all types of coal, saves an average of 50% to 70% of coal, and speeds up cooking time by one to two times, making it most suitable for collective canteens.

The structure of this type of stove is very simple, and any bricklayer can build it after seeing it. However, the following points must be noted during construction: 1. The grate bars should be dense enough to prevent small pieces of coal from falling through. To prevent the flame from being obstructed and to facilitate coal addition, the grate bars must be higher in the front and lower in the back; the distance between the bottom of the pot and the grate bars should be 13 cm; the depth of the ground wind hole is generally 80 to 100 cm, and should be narrower at the top and wider at the bottom. 2. The chimney must be higher than the roof ridge of the tile house, and the ash outlet must be tightly sealed; the inside of the stove should be smoothed; otherwise, it will lose its effectiveness due to air leaks. The distance between the pot and the stove, at the bottom, is 5 cm, gradually decreasing to 2 cm at the top of the pot, and should not be too wide to avoid wasting firepower. (Attached picture)

Xinhua News Agency reporter Xia Daoling reported that staff at the canteen of the Nanyang Neighborhood Committee in Shanghai's Xincheng District use coal slag to seal the furnace when the coal stove is not in use, keeping the fire burning day and night. This saves 600 jin of coal and 300 jin of firewood each month.

### 双眼回风灶省煤一半多

    双眼回风灶省煤一半多
    复县大力推广“双眼回风灶”。据不完全统计，全县农村公社已经推行四百八十六个，效果很好。得利寺管理区杨屯食堂改用回风灶后，平均耗煤量由过去每人每日两斤，降到半斤，做饭时间由过去两小时半，降到四十分钟，每月可节约伙食费开支一百六十元。
    双眼回风灶，由于充分利用“地风”和烟囱抽力的助燃作用，火力旺盛；并且因为炉条在锅底前部，火被烟囱的抽力抽回扑在锅肚上，锅底受热面积大；又由于炉门（烧煤口）小，两个出烟孔留的恰当，不呛烟，不喷火。这种灶不用吹风设备，各种煤炭都能烧，平均可省煤50％到70％，并且加快作饭时间一倍到两倍多，最适合集体食堂使用。
    这种炉灶的构造很简单，一般瓦工看过就会盘，但在盘灶中必须注意：一、炉条要密，以不漏碎煤为宜；为了火苗不受阻碍和添煤方便，炉条必须前高后低；锅底与炉条距离十三公分；地风洞深度一般在八十到一百公分，要上窄下宽。二、烟囱高度必须超出瓦房脊，并且要扎严灰口；灶膛内要抹光；否则会因透风而失去效能。锅与灶膛距离，底部为五公分，到锅上边逐步达到两公分，不宜太宽，免得浪费火力。（附图片）
