    The Geneva East-West Foreign Ministers' Conference, which began on May 11th, was adjourned temporarily for three weeks on June 20th at the request of Western countries, to reconvene on July 13th. This adjournment was unnecessary in the first place. Since the Western countries were forced to open the "package plan" aimed at blocking any agreement at the meeting on May 26th and put forward the so-called "seven-point plan" on the Berlin issue, the meeting has entered the stage of discussing specific issues; it should have been possible to achieve positive results on some specific issues and reach an agreement on the specific arrangements for holding a summit meeting of East and West heads of government. During the half-month of discussions on the Berlin issue, this possibility has been increasing due to the continuous efforts of the Soviet and German Democratic Republic delegations. Especially after the Soviet Union fully considered the wishes expressed by the West in its so-called "final proposal" on the Berlin issue on June 16th and put forward a new proposal on June 19th, the two sides were closer, and it should have been possible to continue the discussion to reach an agreement. However, the representatives of the Western countries, like ants on a hot pot, were anxious to adjourn the meeting, and even before Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko clarified the new proposal, they put forward the request for adjournment.
    So, what exactly caused the representatives of the Western countries to be unable to sit still? It is necessary to make a brief review of the past six weeks of the meeting.
    The West is Forced to Participate in the Meeting
    This Geneva meeting was initiated by the Soviet Union. In order to promote the peaceful settlement of the German question and ease the tense situation in Europe, the Soviet Union proposed on November 27 last year to end the occupation regime in West Berlin and turn West Berlin into a demilitarized free city. And because the Western countries used the excuse that the entire German question must be resolved first, the Soviet Union proposed on January 10 this year a proposal on the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. The Soviet Union's peace proposal quickly won the support of the people of the world, because people see very clearly that the increasingly disturbing tension in Europe today is largely due to the Western countries taking advantage of the abnormal situation of not having a peace treaty with Germany to actively arm West German militarists, and West Berlin under Western occupation has become a center for Western countries to conduct a cold war in Europe. The peaceful prospect shown by the Soviet Union's proposal inspired all peace-loving people, especially the German people who longed for the peaceful reunification of their motherland and the European people who were worried about the recurrence of Hitler's disasters; they unanimously demanded that Western countries change their past rigid policies and conduct serious negotiations on the Soviet Union's proposals. At the same time, the Soviet Union's successive initiatives put the Western countries in a completely passive position, and they could no longer find an excuse to refuse negotiations. At the same time, they had serious differences among themselves on the issue of negotiations for their respective domestic and foreign interests, and Macmillan's visit to the Soviet Union in February despite the opposition of his allies was a clear sign of this difference. It was precisely in the face of the pressure of the people of the world and the fact that their rigid policies were being forced into a corner by the Soviet Union's peace proposals that Western countries had to agree to hold an East-West foreign ministers' meeting with representatives of the two Germanys in order to get rid of passivity and ease internal contradictions.
    Two Roads
    According to the agreement reached by the four major powers in the preparation process of the East-West foreign ministers' meeting, the settlement of the German question is the main task of the meeting. But how to solve it? Here, there appeared two roads.
    The Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic advocate the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany that is sufficient to ensure the peaceful and democratic development of Germany. If the Western countries are not willing to conclude such a treaty at present, they can first start to end the occupation regime in West Berlin. To this end, the Soviet Union formally submitted to the foreign ministers' meeting a draft peace treaty with Germany and a proposal on the four major powers guaranteeing West Berlin as a demilitarized free city. The starting point of these proposals is: the reality of the coexistence of the two Germanys cannot be ignored, the international principle that the internal affairs of the German people should not be interfered with by external forces cannot be violated, and the four major powers only have the obligation to promote the mutual approach of the two Germanys to achieve German reunification, and do not have the right to monopolize the affairs of "unified Germany." According to the draft peace treaty with Germany proposed by the Soviet Union, it will be able to ensure that the two Germanys develop along the road of peace and democracy, which can not only eliminate the threat of West German militarization to European peace, but also promote the mutual approach of the two Germanys to achieve the goal of reunification. With the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, the West Berlin issue will naturally be resolved easily. Even if the East and West sides cannot reach an agreement on the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany for a while, as long as an agreement can be reached on the issue of ending the occupation regime in West Berlin first, this important source of international tension can also be eliminated, and a bridge can be built for the approach of the two Germanys. Therefore, it is very clear that the road followed by the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic is the only reasonable and feasible road to solving the German question; if the Western countries have sincerity, solving the German question should not be difficult.
    However, the Western countries insisted on another road. They advocated starting to solve the German question from "unified Germany." The so-called "package plan" they submitted to the foreign ministers' meeting, in essence, does not allow the German people to decide their own affairs at all. This "plan" stipulates that a "pan-German mixed committee" composed of representatives of East and West Germany should be established, and this committee should be at the command of the four major powers, the "election law" drafted by the committee should be approved by the four countries, the arrangements of the committee can be changed by the four countries, and the "pan-German free election" should be conducted under foreign supervision. In all these processes, the Western countries must maintain their occupying troops in West Germany to ensure that the West German people, who account for two-thirds of the German population, can "freely" express the will of their occupiers in the pan-German election. Even more absurd is that this plan stipulates that before German reunification, East and West Berlin must first hold elections under foreign supervision to achieve reunification, and the governance of the "unified" city of Berlin must be placed under the supreme power of the four major powers, not only will the occupation regime in West Berlin not be abolished, but an occupation regime must also be established in East Berlin. This is not all, this plan also twists together the issue of "unified Germany" with complex issues such as European security, comprehensive disarmament, and European political issues, making them difficult to separate: German reunification depends on European security, European security depends on comprehensive disarmament, comprehensive disarmament depends on the settlement of European political issues, and the settlement of European political issues depends on German reunification. After繞了半天 turning around for a long time, it returns to the original place, forming an endless vicious circle. Anyone who wants to explore a glimmer of hope for solving the German question in it is tantamount to鑽到钻into a sealed vacuum tube to find air. It is not difficult to see that the road insisted on by the Western countries is nothing more than ending the settlement of the German question with the German Democratic Republic being annexed by militarist West Germany; since this delusion will never be realized, this road ultimately can only permanently split Germany.
    Two Attitudes
    From the entire process of the Geneva meeting for six weeks, people can clearly see two completely different attitudes. The Soviet and German Democratic Republic delegations treated the negotiations of the meeting with a very serious and highly conciliatory spirit. For example, when the United States, Britain, and France disregarded the clear agreement reached by the four major powers in the process of preparing for the meeting that the representatives of the two Germanys should participate in the meeting, and attempted to restrict or even deprive the Germans of the right to effectively participate in the meeting from the beginning of the meeting, the Soviet Union immediately waged a resolute struggle to safeguard the rights of the Germans, because, after all, the mission of the Geneva meeting was to discuss issues of vital interest to the entire German people, and the principle that "Germans have the right to participate in the settlement of the German question" cannot be violated. And when the United States, Britain, and France repeatedly unreasonably rejected the Soviet Union's proposal to invite Poland and Czechoslovakia to participate in the meeting, although the Soviet Union possessed all legitimate reasons, it did not allow the meeting to be deadlocked on this issue (because this is different in nature from the issue of Germans participating in the meeting), but after fully exposing the unreasonableness of the Western arguments, it temporarily put the issue aside to facilitate the progress of the meeting. For another example, while the Soviet Union waged an uncompromising struggle against the conspiracies of the West to "unify Germany" and permanently maintain the occupation rights of West Berlin, it also fully considered certain wishes in the Western proposals, and more than once appropriately absorbed certain opinions of the West in its own proposals, in order to narrow the distance between the two sides and strive to increase the possibility of reaching an agreement. On the side of the German Democratic Republic, it has also made significant efforts time and again to strive for mutual understanding between the two Germanys and promote the reaching of an agreement at the meeting. For example, Foreign Minister Bolz's seven speeches at the formal meeting contained seven new proposals to strive for understanding and ease the situation. All these fully demonstrate the sincerity of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic towards the negotiations.
    However, the attitude of the Western countries is completely another matter. They stubbornly maintained their original rigid position and refused to take any steps that would help to bring the views of the two sides closer. Their so-called "package plan," which they claimed was a "major concession" to the Soviet Union, was actually pieced together with concepts that they had been playing with for the past few years, and the only "new" thing was to expand the occupation regime in West Berlin to East Berlin! The event of their proposing the "package plan" itself shows that they are not treating the negotiations with a serious attitude. How can such a dead knot be used as the basis for the meeting's discussion? What else can this explain except that they are trying to lead the meeting into an impenetrable bagua formation? It is no wonder that as soon as the "package plan" came out, world public opinion was immediately in an uproar, and the Western countries themselves had to put it aside soon after.
    What is even worse is that the Western countries, especially the United States, constantly threatened the Soviet Union with an ultimatum tone to accept its will during the meeting. The Western countries' proposal on the Berlin issue on June 16 was put forward in the form of a so-called "final proposal." The United States took advantage of the Soviet Union's sincere desire to reach an agreement on the issue of holding a summit meeting of heads of government, and more than once threatened that the United States would not agree to hold a summit meeting if the foreign ministers' meeting did not make progress. US Secretary of State Herter also repeatedly put on a threatening posture of being ready to fly away from Geneva at any time. While carrying out such shameless threats, the United States constantly slandered the Soviet Union's proposals as "ultimatums," saying that the United States would never "negotiate under threat." All these fully demonstrate that the Western countries have consistently obstructed the smooth progress of the meeting during the six weeks of the meeting.
    Why Request an Adjournment
    The road insisted on by the Western countries and the attitude taken by them cannot but arouse the severe condemnation of world fair public opinion. Their plan to shift the responsibility for undermining the meeting onto the Soviet Union from the very beginning of the meeting has been completely disrupted by the Soviet Union's initiative and flexibility. The situation inside and outside the meeting forced the West to change its path and adopt a new attitude. However, the Western countries are neither willing to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union on major issues, nor are they afraid to openly bring the meeting to a breakdown. Moreover, they have their own plans and do not agree with each other. When the Soviet Foreign Minister put forward a new proposal, they were neither willing to continue the meeting to reach an agreement, nor dared to close the door to negotiations, so they had to choose one of the two and proposed to adjourn the meeting for three weeks.
    The situation in the ten days since the adjournment so far shows that the Western countries are actively carrying out a conspiracy to shift the responsibility for undermining the Geneva meeting onto the Soviet Union during the adjournment period. US Secretary of State Herter wantonly slandered in his speech on June 23 that "the Soviet Union has not shown that it is interested in conducting real negotiations," and insisted that the Soviet Union had made "threats" in the negotiations. British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, although he emphasized in his remarks after returning home that the meeting had not broken down, still tried to shift the responsibility for the fact that the Geneva meeting had not reached any agreement so far to the Soviet Union in a roundabout way. What is even more serious is that West Germany, with the tacit understanding of the United States, Britain, and France, actually decided to hold presidential elections in West Berlin on July 1, in an attempt to create a new crisis through this open provocative action. However, the Western countries' conspiracy to shift the responsibility for undermining the meeting onto the Soviet Union is ultimately doomed to failure. The people of the world have clearly seen from the previous stage of the meeting the role played by the Western countries in obstructing the reaching of an agreement, and they will closely watch whether the Western countries will change their attitude after the meeting reconvenes on July 13.

    半月国际述评
    （六月十六日至六月三十日）
    5月11日开始的日内瓦东西方外长会议，在西方国家的要求下，于6月20日宣布暂时休会三星期，到7月13日复会。这次休会本来是不必要的。因为，自从西方国家被迫在5月26日打开了旨在堵塞会议达成任何协议的“一揽子计划”，而提出关于柏林问题的所谓“七点计划”以来，会议就进入了讨论具体问题的阶段；应该有可能在一些具体问题上取得积极结果，并且在举行东西方国家政府首脑会议的具体安排上达成协议。这种可能性在对柏林问题的半个多月的讨论过程中，由于苏联和德意志民主共和国代表团的不断努力，是日益增长的。特别是在苏联充分考虑了西方于6月16日提出的关于柏林问题的所谓“最后建议”中所表示的愿望，而在6月19日提出新建议之后，双方就更加接近，按道理是应该继续讨论下去以求达成协议的。然而西方国家的代表却像热锅上的蚂蚁似的，急于要休会，甚至不等苏联外长葛罗米柯阐明新建议，就提出休会的要求。
    那么，究竟是什么原因促使西方国家的代表坐不下去了呢？这里有必要对过去六个星期的会议作一次简单的回顾。
    西方被迫参加会议
    这次日内瓦会议是由于苏联的主动而促成的。苏联为了促进德国问题的和平解决并缓和欧洲紧张局势，在去年11月27日提出了结束西柏林占领制度、把西柏林变为非军事化自由城市的建议。而由于西方国家借口必须首先解决整个德国问题，苏联又在今年1月10日提出关于缔结对德和约的建议。苏联的和平建议迅速获得了全世界人民的拥护，因为人们看得很清楚，今天欧洲所存在的越来越令人不安的紧张局势，在很大程度上是由于西方国家利用没有对德和约这一不正常的情况，积极武装西德军国主义分子，而在西方占领下的西柏林更成为西方国家在欧洲进行冷战的一个中心。苏联的建议所展现的和平远景，鼓舞了一切爱好和平的人民，特别是鼓舞了渴望祖国和平统一的德国人民和担心希特勒的灾祸重临的欧洲人民；他们一致要求西方国家改变过去的僵硬政策，就苏联的建议进行认真的谈判。同时，苏联的一个紧接着一个的主动创议，使西方国家处于完全被动的地位，它们再也找不出拒绝谈判的借口。同时，它们相互之间又为了各自的国内外利益而在谈判的问题上产生了严重的分歧，2月间麦克米伦不顾其盟国的反对而访问苏联，就是这种分歧的鲜明标志。西方国家正是在面对着世界人民的压力，和它们的僵硬政策被苏联的和平建议逼到墙角的情况下，为了摆脱被动、缓和内部矛盾，才不得不同意举行有两个德国的代表参加的东西方外长会议。
    两条道路
    根据四大国在东西方外长会议筹备过程中所达成的协议，解决德国问题是会议的主要任务。但是，如何解决呢？这里出现了两条道路。
    苏联和德意志民主共和国主张缔结一个足以保证德国和平民主地发展的对德和约，如果西方国家现时还不愿缔结这样一个和约，也可以先着手结束西柏林的占领制度。为此，苏联先后向外长会议正式提出对德和约草案和关于四大国保证西柏林成为非军事化自由城市的建议。这些建议的出发点是：两个德国并存这一现实不容忽视，德国人民的内政不容外力干涉这一国际准则不容违背，四大国只有促进两个德国互相接近以实现全德统一的义务，没有包办“统一德国”的事务的权利。根据苏联所提出的对德和约草案，将能够保证两个德国都沿着和平民主的道路发展，既可以消除西德军国主义化对欧洲和平的威胁，又可以促进两个德国互相接近而实现统一的目的。缔结了对德和约，西柏林问题自然迎刃而解。即使东西双方一时不能在缔结对德和约的问题上达成协议，只要能先就结束西柏林占领制度的问题达成协议，也可以消除国际紧张局势的这一个重要策源地，并为两个德国的接近架起桥梁。因此，很显然，苏联和德意志民主共和国所遵循的道路，是解决德国问题的唯一合乎情理、切实可行的道路；西方国家如果有诚意，解决德国问题应该是不困难的。
    然而，西方国家却坚持另一条道路。它们主张从“统一德国”来着手解决德国问题。它们向外长会议提出的所谓“一揽子计划”，实质上根本不让德国人自己决定自己的事务。这个“计划”规定要成立一个由东西德代表组成的“全德混合委员会”，而这个委员会要听命于四大国，委员会拟订的“选举法”要由四国批准，委员会的安排四国可加改变，“全德自由选举”要在外国监督下进行。在所有这些过程中，西方国家都要保持它们在西德的占领军队，以保证占全德人口三分之二的西德人民在全德选举中“自由”表达他们的占领者的意志。更荒唐的是，这个计划规定在德国统一之前，必须先使东西柏林在外国监督之下举行选举实现统一，而“统一”后的柏林市的治理要置于四大国的最高权力之下，不仅西柏林的占领制度不取消，还要在东柏林也建立起占领制度。这还不算，这个计划又把“统一德国”的问题同欧洲安全、全面裁军、欧洲政治问题等等复杂问题都拧在一起，难解难分：德国的统一要取决于欧洲安全，欧洲安全要取决于全面裁军，全面裁军要取决于欧洲政治问题的解决，而欧洲政治问题的解决又要取决于德国的统一。绕了半天又回到原处，形成永远也解不开的连环套。谁要想在这里面去探求解决德国问题的一线希望，无异于钻到密封的真空管中去寻找空气。不难看出，西方国家所坚持的道路，无非是使德国问题的解决以德意志民主共和国被军国主义西德所并吞而告终；既然这种妄想永远不可能实现，这条道路归根结底只能是永远分裂德国。
    两种态度
    从日内瓦会议六个星期的全部过程中，人们可以清楚地看到两种迥然不同的态度。苏联和德意志民主共和国代表团以十分认真和高度和解的精神对待会议的谈判。譬如，当美、英、法在会议一开始就不顾四大国在会议筹备过程中所达成的关于两个德国的代表应当参加会议的明确协议，企图限制甚至剥夺德国人有效地参加会议的权利的时候，苏联立即为维护德国人的权利进行了坚决的斗争，因为，日内瓦会议的使命毕竟就是讨论同全体德国人民有切身利害关系的问题，“德国人有权参加解决德国问题”这一原则是不容违背的。而当美、英、法一再无理拒绝苏联的关于邀请波兰和捷克斯洛伐克参加会议的建议的时候，虽然苏联拥有一切正当的理由，却并不使会议在这个问题上僵持下去（因为这同德国人参加会议的问题在性质上毕竟有所不同），而是在充分揭露了西方论点的无理之后，把问题暂时保留在一边，以利会议的进行。又譬如，苏联一方面对西方的“统一德国”和永远保持对西柏林的占领权利这类阴谋进行决不妥协的斗争，另一方面也充分考虑西方的建议中的某些愿望，并且不止一次地在自己的建议中适当地吸收了西方的某些意见，以缩小双方距离，力求增加达成协议的可能性。在德意志民主共和国方面，也是一次又一次地为争取两个德国的相互谅解、促进会议达成协议而进行了重大的努力，譬如博尔茨外长在正式会议上的七次发言，就包含七项争取谅解和缓和局势的新建议。凡此种种，都充分说明了苏联和德意志民主共和国对谈判的诚意。
    但是，西方国家的态度却完全是另一回事。它们顽固地维持原来的僵硬立场，拒绝采取任何有助于双方观点接近的步骤。它们自称是向苏联作了“重大让步”的“一揽子计划”，实际上全是用过去几年来被它们玩弄烂了的概念拚凑起来的，唯一的“新”东西就是要把西柏林的占领制度扩展到东柏林去！它们提出“一揽子计划”这一事件本身，就说明它们不是以认真的态度来对待谈判的。那样一个拧成死结的连环套怎么能作为会议讨论的基础呢？这除了说明它们企图把会议引入有进无出的八卦阵之外，还能说明什么呢？难怪“一揽子计划”一出笼，世界舆论立即大哗，西方国家自己不久也就不得不把它搁在一边了。
    更为恶劣的是，西方国家，其中特别是美国，在会议的过程中不断以最后通牒式的口吻威胁苏联接受其意志。西方国家6月16日的关于柏林问题的建议就是以所谓“最后建议”的形式提出的。美国利用苏联在就召开政府首脑会议的问题上达成协议的真诚愿望，不止一次地威胁说外长会议无进展美国就不同意召开首脑会议。美国国务卿赫脱还屡次摆出准备随时乘飞机离开日内瓦的威吓姿态。而在进行这样无耻威胁的同时，美国竟然不断诬蔑苏联的建议是“最后通牒”，说什么美国决不“在威胁下谈判”。凡此种种，充分说明了西方国家在六个星期的会议过程中始终阻挠会议的顺利进行。
    为什么要求休会
    西方国家所坚持的道路和所采取的态度，不能不引起世界公正舆论的严厉谴责。它们从会议一开始就企图把破坏会议的责任倒栽在苏联身上的计划，由于苏联的主动灵活性而被完全打乱。会议内外的形势逼得西方必须改换道路和采取新的态度。但是，西方国家既不愿就重大问题同苏联达成协议，又害怕公然使会议陷于破裂。而且它们之间各有打算，同床异梦。在苏联外长提出新建议时，它们既不愿继续开会以达成协议，又不敢关闭谈判之门，于是只有二者折乎其中，提出休会三星期的要求。
    迄今为止休会十天以来的情况表明，西方国家正利用休会的期间，积极进行把破坏日内瓦会议的责任推到苏联身上去的阴谋。美国国务卿赫脱在6月23日的演说中放肆地诬蔑“苏联并没有表明它有兴趣进行真正的谈判”，硬说苏联在谈判中进行了“威胁”。英国外交大臣劳埃德在他回国后的言论中虽然强调了会议没有破裂，但仍然转弯抹角地企图把日内瓦会议迄今没有达成任何协议的责任推诿于苏联。更加严重的是，西德在美、英、法的默契下，竟然决定于7月1日在西柏林举行总统选举，企图通过这种公开的挑衅行动来制造新的危机。但是，西方国家把破坏会议的责任倒栽在苏联身上的阴谋，毕竟是心劳日拙的。世界人民已经从前一阶段的会议过程中清楚地看到西方国家所起的阻挠达成协议的作用，他们将密切注视西方国家是否在7月13日复会以后改变它们的态度。
