A Symbol of Friendship
——Remembering the Bucharest Chinese Economic Construction Exhibition
By our correspondent Wei Lingbing

In May and June, Bucharest was filled with the fragrance of linden blossoms. Stalin Park was lush with greenery and blooming flowers. It was here that the Chinese Economic Construction Exhibition was held.

This exhibition was the first comprehensive economic construction exhibition held by our country in Romania. Many people considered it a major event in Bucharest since the beginning of summer. During the preparation for and after the opening of the exhibition, the Romanian Ministry of Trade and the Chamber of Commerce provided great assistance. The director, Party Secretary, and Chairman of the Trade Union of the "Mao Zedong" factory in the capital came to meet with the head of the exhibition delegation at the beginning of the setup, requesting that the factory's employees contribute to the exhibition. They said, "If you need people, we have people. If you need things, we have things." Several other factories also automatically sent workers and technicians to support the exhibition's preparation work. This enthusiastic assistance and touching spirit of friendship fully embodies the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Romanian people.

The exhibition area covered 4,500 square meters, with approximately 7,000 exhibits, ranging from giant lathes to precision instruments, from silk to special steel, most of which were new products from our country's Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture last year.

In the exhibition hall, heavy industrial products accounted for 60% of the exhibition area. The vertical lathe towering in the exhibition hall was a popular object of attention for visitors. New machines such as the M131W universal grinder, the X460 electric profiling milling machine, the spinning machine, the carding machine, as well as the eighty-horsepower tractor and the Shanghai brand bus, were all praised by the audience. Many engineers and workers carefully observed the machine operation, studied the machine's performance, and requested to see relevant technical materials, drawing diagrams of the machines.

The rich and colorful, high-quality textiles aroused great interest among the audience. Many people liked to touch the gorgeous silks and smell the fragrant printed cloth. The dazzling handicrafts, the gleaming medical devices, and the exquisite and beautiful stationery and daily necessities also attracted countless visitors. Many visitors inquired whether the exhibits were for sale. They hoped to open a Chinese store in Romania where they could regularly buy their favorite Chinese goods.

Many farmers who came from afar carefully visited the various grain specimens. What they were most concerned about was the "secret" of our country's farmers achieving high yields. This "secret" was hanging on the wall, which was the "Eight-Character Charter" explained with eight large pictures. After the guides explained them one by one, they all felt that they had obtained satisfactory answers.

On May 22, Romanian party and government leaders headed by Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej visited the exhibition. During the one-and-a-half-hour visit, they carefully viewed all the exhibits. Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and Chivu Stoica, who came from working-class backgrounds, paid special attention to various machines. They watched the operation performance of each machine and asked many related questions. Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej was very interested in the integration of traditional Chinese and Western medicine. He said humorously when he saw tiger bone wine: "If you want to drink tiger bone wine, you have to catch tigers." He also praised the rural landscaping in our country and the products made by students under the policy of combining education with productive labor.

Although it often rained during the exhibition, the audience was still very enthusiastic. The exhibition was originally scheduled to close on June 5, but at the request of the audience, it had to be extended for nine days. In the many visitor opinion books filled with densely packed words, it is not difficult to see sentences like: "This is my second visit," "This is my third visit."... A nurse came almost every day. It turned out that this girl not only liked all the exhibits, but was also fascinated by the beautiful Chinese music broadcast in the exhibition hall.

Tens of thousands of people also watched Chinese films shown outdoors outside the exhibition hall. They saw the life and work of the Chinese people, saw the heroic deeds of "moving mountains and filling seas," and saw the jubilant scenes of the National Day celebrations. They were encouraged by the Great Leap Forward of the Chinese people.

This exhibition played a significant role in promoting the friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and Romanian people. The exhibition enabled the audience to have a better understanding of our country's socialist construction and the lives of the working people. They more deeply appreciated the value of the friendship between the Chinese and Romanian people. Many visitors requested the Chinese comrades of the exhibition to visit their homes as guests.

A visitor wrote in the opinion book: "The exhibition left me with infinitely beautiful impressions, like a string of pearls, forever hanging in my heart." (Attached picture)

The Chinese Economic Construction Exhibition held in Bucharest since May 15 closed on June 14. The exhibition was warmly welcomed by the Romanian people. The number of visitors to the exhibition reached more than 400,000, which is about one-third of the population of Bucharest. Romanian party and government leaders Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Chivu Stoica and others also visited the exhibition.

    友谊的标志
    ——记布加勒斯特中国经济建设展览会
    本报记者　魏凌冰
    5、6月间，布加勒斯特满城菩提花香，斯大林公园里绿树成荫，鲜花盛开，在这里举行了中国经济建设展览会。
    这次展览会是我国在罗马尼亚举行的第一次综合性经济建设展览会。许多人都认为这是布加勒斯特入夏以来的大事件。在展览会筹备期间和开幕以后，罗马尼亚贸易部和商会都给了很大帮助。首都“毛泽东”工厂的厂长、党委书记和工会主席在展览会开始布置时就一同来会见展览团负责人，要求让他们工厂的职工能为展览会出点力。他们说：“你们要人有人，要东西有东西。”还有另外的几个工厂也自动派工人和技术人员支援了展览会的准备工作。这些热情的帮助和感人的友爱精神，充分体现了中罗两国人民的兄弟情谊。
    这个展览会的展览面积为四千五百平方公尺，各种展品共约七千件，从巨型车床到精密仪器，从绸缎到特种钢，绝大部分是去年我国工农业大跃进中的新产品。
    在展览馆中，重工业产品占展览面积的60％。耸立在展览馆中的立式车床是观众普遍注意的对象。M131W型万能磨床、X460型电动仿型铣床、精纺机、梳棉机等新式机器和八十马力的拖拉机、上海牌公共汽车等都受到了观众的称赞。有不少工程师和工人都认真地参观了机器操作，研究了机器的性能，并要求看有关的技术资料，绘下了机器的图样。
    丰富多采、质量优良的纺织品引起观众的极大兴趣。许多人都喜欢摸一摸华丽的绸缎，闻一闻有香味的花布。琳琅满目的手工艺品，闪闪发光的医疗器械，精致美观的文具和日用品等也吸引了无数观众。许多观众都询问展品卖不卖。他们希望能在罗马尼亚开个中国商店，可以经常买到自己喜爱的中国商品。
    许多远道而来的农民仔细参观了多种多样的粮食标本。他们最关心的是我国农民取得高产的“秘诀”。这“秘诀”就挂在墙上，就是用八幅大图片作说明的“八字宪法”。当解说员向他们一一讲解后，他们都认为已经获得了满意的答复。
    5月22日，以乔治乌—德治同志为首的罗马尼亚党政领导人来到了展览会。在一个半小时的参观过程中，他们仔细地看了全部展品。工人出身的乔治乌—德治和基伏·斯托伊卡同志对各种机器特别注意，他们观看了每台机器的操作表演，提出了许多有关的问题。乔治乌—德治同志对中西医结合问题很感兴趣。他在看到虎骨酒时很有风趣地说：“要想喝虎骨酒，就得去捉老虎。”他还称赞了我国农村的田园化和学生们在教育与劳动生产相结合的方针下制造的产品。
    在展览会举行期间虽然常常落雨，但观众仍然很踊跃。展览会本来决定在6月5日闭幕，在观众的要求下，又不得不延长了九天。你在写得密密麻麻的许多本观众意见簿中，不难看到这样的字句：“我是第二次来参观了”，“我是第三次来参观了”。……有一个护士几乎是天天都来一次，原来这个姑娘不但喜欢所有的展品，而且也被展览馆中播送的优美的中国音乐迷住了。
    成千上万的人还看了在展览馆外露天放映的中国电影。他们看到了我国人民的生活和劳动情况，看到了“移山填海”的英雄事迹，看到了国庆节举国欢腾的景象。他们对中国人民的大跃进感到欢欣鼓舞。
    这次展览会对促进中罗两国人民的友谊和合作具有很大作用。展览会使观众对我国的社会主义建设和劳动人民的生活有了进一步的了解。他们更加体会到中罗两国人民友谊的可贵。有不少观众都要求展览会的中国同志到他们家去做客。
    一个观众在意见簿上写道：“展览会给我留下无限美好的印象，就像一串珍珠一样，永远挂在我的心上。”（附图片）
    自5月15日起在布加勒斯特举行的中国经济建设展览会已于6月14日闭幕。这个展览会受到罗马尼亚人民的热烈欢迎。参观展览会的人数达四十万人以上，约等于布加勒斯特人口三分之一。罗马尼亚党和政府领导人乔治乌—德治、基伏·斯托伊卡等也参观了展览会。
