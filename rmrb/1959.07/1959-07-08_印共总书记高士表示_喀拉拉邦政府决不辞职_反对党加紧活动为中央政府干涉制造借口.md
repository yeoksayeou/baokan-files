Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 7th. Indian Communist Party General Secretary Ajoy Ghosh told a "Times of India" reporter here on the 6th that the Kerala government would never resign and would not betray the trust of the people.

Ghosh said that accepting Prime Minister Nehru's suggestion to hold new elections in Kerala would be tantamount to handing the people over to reactionary and caste forces, which would never implement any progressive reforms in the state.

Kerala Chief Minister Namboodiripad said in a statement in the state capital, Thiruvananthapuram, on the 6th, that the demand for new elections meant taking unconstitutional actions. He stated that the Kerala government had accepted two suggestions made by Nehru during his recent visit to the state: that the state government hold meetings with the opposition and study the education law with relevant parties such as school administrators. However, the Congress Party Parliamentary Committee passed a resolution demanding new elections. He pointed out that the leaders of the Kerala Congress Party refused to hold discussions with the state government and continued to carry out agitation campaigns. Some prominent figures of the Congress Party have recently expressed their opinions on the situation in Kerala. Punjab Governor Gadgil said on the 5th that the current agitation against the Kerala government was not good. Kerala was "a government elected in accordance with the constitution, with the right and duty to continue to govern until it resigns or is defeated in an election." Former Central Government Finance Minister Deshmukh also said on the 5th that public reactions should be expressed through parliamentary discussions, and any other methods should be condemned.

This newspaper reports: After Indian Prime Minister Nehru's suggestion for new elections in Kerala was rejected by the Indian Communist Party, the Kerala opposition has stepped up planning agitation campaigns to create a pretext for direct intervention by the central government.

In late June, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, at the invitation of Kerala Chief Minister Namboodiripad, made a three-day inspection visit to Kerala. When he left the Kerala capital of Thiruvananthapuram and arrived at Delhi Airport, he twice stated that the solution to the state's problems was to hold new elections. At the same time, when he spoke to reporters about whether the Indian central government would intervene in the situation in Kerala, he said: "The central government is extremely concerned. However, at present, we have no intention of intervening in Kerala. What will happen in the future depends on future developments."

The Indian Congress Party Central Parliamentary Committee passed a resolution on June 29 demanding that the Kerala government hold general elections, and threatened that "if no appropriate democratic solution is found, conflicts and instability of life and property will intensify." The National Executive Committee of the Indian People's Socialist Party also passed a resolution on June 27 demanding the resignation of the Kerala government "in order for new decisions to be made in elections." The Kerala Committee of this party also decided on July 5 that all party members in the State Legislative Assembly and party members in government committees should submit their resignations.

The CPI Central Committee passed a resolution on June 27, rejecting Prime Minister Nehru's proposal to hold new elections in Kerala. The resolution pointed out that Nehru's proposal "simply puts a democratic facade on the discriminatory demands that the opposition parties want to achieve through illegal means. In effect, it means: using the excuse that some people oppose the Communist government, the Communist government is not allowed to complete its term as prescribed by the constitution" (Note: According to the Indian Constitution, the term of office of a state government is five years. The Kerala government was established in April 1957). The resolution emphasized that "there is no question of the Kerala government resigning" after listing the facts showing that the Kerala government had won the trust and support of the people.

Therefore, on the one hand, the Kerala opposition parties and sectarian forces continue to plan various "direct actions," organized an unsuccessful "general strike" on June 29, and continue to carry out "picketing" activities, obstructing the normal operation of schools, government agencies, and bus transportation, creating riots and conflicts and other violent incidents; on the other hand, they are trying to create new excuses for direct intervention by the central government. According to reports from India, the Kerala Congress Party is preparing to submit a "bill of indictment" against the Kerala Communist government to Indian President Prasad in July. Opposition parties are also instigating the governor to recommend that the president remove the Communist government, dissolve the state assembly, and directly take over the work of the state government.

According to the Indian News Agency, the upcoming session of the Indian People's Assembly will debate the situation in Kerala, after which "the federal government will soon raise this issue, and with the consent of the parliament, the central government will take over the Kerala government." The "Hindustan Times" wrote: "Central intervention in Kerala—which now seems inevitable—cannot be delayed for long because the situation is getting more and more serious."

People from all walks of life in India continue to criticize the Congress Party's attitude towards the Kerala government. A recent message from the Indian Press Trust said: "The Congress Party has been criticized by a very influential section of domestic public opinion, who are dissatisfied with the role it has played in this opposition-led movement" because they believe that "attempting to bring down the government without relying on the voters who elected it" is "unconstitutional." Two former federal ministers, Deshmukh, the current chairman of the University Grants Commission, and Gadgil, the current governor of Punjab, have criticized the movement to overthrow the Kerala government. Many prominent figures have demanded that the Congress Party abide by democratic and constitutional procedures on the Kerala situation, including former Governor-General Rajagopalachari, Kerala Scheduled Caste leader Velayudhan, and other celebrities, writers, and Christians. Velayudhan recently issued a statement condemning the agitation activities of the opposition parties, saying that this was "the most unpleasant thing heard in recent years." The "Hindustan Times" reported that a group of prominent Christian leaders issued a statement calling on Christians in Kerala to pay attention to the negotiation proposals put forward by the Kerala government and to consult with the state government. The "Times of India" also expressed opposition to the Congress Party's direct action plan, saying that if the federal government intervenes after the party it represents has partially created the conditions for intervention, it would be an unconstitutional act. Certain local Congress Party organizations in Delhi, such as the Congress Party District Committee in the Yagratura District, called on the Congress Party Chairman "not to exacerbate the crisis in Kerala."

    印共总书记高士表示
    喀拉拉邦政府决不辞职
    反对党加紧活动为中央政府干涉制造借口
    新华社新德里7日电　印度共产党总书记高士6日在这里向“印度时报”记者发表谈话说，喀拉拉邦政府决不辞职，它不会辜负人民的信任。
    高士说，如果接受尼赫鲁总理提出的关于在喀拉拉邦重新举行选举的意见，那就等于把人民交给反动势力和教族势力，这些势力永远也不会在邦内实行任何进步的改革。
    喀拉拉邦首席部长南布迪里巴德6日在邦首府特里凡得琅发表声明说，关于重新举行选举的要求意味着采取违反宪法的行动。他表示，喀拉拉邦政府已经接受了尼赫鲁最近在访问这个邦时提出的两项建议，即：邦政府同反对派举行会议和同学校管理人等有关方面研究教育法的问题。但是国大党议会委员会又通过决议要求重新举行选举。他指出，喀拉拉邦国大党的领导人拒绝同邦政府举行讨论，并且继续进行煽动运动。一些国大党的著名人士最近曾对喀拉拉邦的局势发表了意见。旁遮普邦邦长加德吉尔5日说，目前反对喀拉拉邦政府的煽动活动是不好的，喀拉拉邦是“根据宪法当选的政府，有权而且将要继续执政到它辞职或是在选举中失败时为止。”前中央政府财政部长德希穆克也在5日说，公众的反应应当通过议会的讨论来表达，任何其他方式都应当受到谴责。
    本报讯　自印度总理尼赫鲁提出在喀拉拉邦重新举行大选的建议遭到印度共产党拒绝后，喀拉拉邦反对党加紧策划煽动运动，制造中央政府直接干涉的借口。
    6月下旬，印度总理尼赫鲁应喀拉拉邦首席部长南布迪里巴德的邀请，在喀拉拉邦内作了为期三天的视察访问。他在离开喀拉拉邦首府特里凡得琅和到达德里机场发表谈话时，两次表示解决这个邦的出路是重新举行选举。同时，他对记者谈到关于印度中央政府是否干预喀拉拉邦的局势问题时说：“中央是极为关心的。但是目前，我们无意干预喀拉拉邦。未来如何要决定于未来的发展情况”。
    印度国大党中央议会委员会会议在6月29日通过决议，要求喀拉拉邦政府举行大选，并威胁说，“如果找不到适当的民主的解决办法，冲突和生命财产的不安定状况将会加剧。”印度人民社会党全国执行委员会也在6月27日通过决议，要求喀拉拉邦政府辞职，“以便在选举中作出新的决定”。这个党的喀拉拉邦委员会还在7月5日决定要所有在邦立法会议内的该党议员和政府各委员会内的该党党员提出辞职。
    印共中央在6月27日通过决议，拒绝尼赫鲁总理关于在喀拉拉邦重新举行大选的建议。决议指出，尼赫鲁的建议“只是给反对党想通过非法手段实现的有着歧视性质的要求，披上一件民主的外衣。它实际上意味着：利用有人反对共产党政府的借口，不让共产党政府任完宪法所规定的任期”（按：照印度宪法规定，邦政府任期五年。喀拉拉邦政府是1957年4月成立的）。决议在列举事实说明喀拉拉邦政府获得人民的信任和拥护后强调说，“根本不产生喀拉拉邦政府辞职的问题。”
    于是，喀拉拉邦反对党和教派势力一面继续策划各种“直接行动”，在6月29日组织了一次不成功的“总罢工”，并继续进行“纠察”活动，阻挠学校、政府机关和公共汽车运输业的正常进行，制造骚乱和冲突等暴力事件；一面则竭力设法为中央进行直接干涉制造新的借口。据印度方面的报道，喀拉拉邦国大党准备在7月内向印度总统普拉沙德提出对喀拉拉邦共产党政府的“指控状”。反对党派还策动由邦长建议总统撤换共产党的政府，解散邦议会，直接接管邦政府工作。
    据印度新闻社透露，即将举行的印度人民院会议将就喀拉拉邦局势进行辩论，然后“联邦政府将很快提出这个问题，在议会的同意下由中央接管喀拉拉邦政府”。“印度斯坦时报”写道：“中央对喀拉拉邦的干涉——现在看来这种干涉是必然的——不可能推延很久，因为局势越来越严重了。”
    印度各界人士继续纷纷批评国大党对待喀拉拉邦政府的态度。印度报业托辣斯不久前的消息说：“国大党遭到国内舆论很有影响的一部分人的批评，他们不满它在这次反对派发动的运动中所起的作用”，因为他们认为“企图不依靠选举这个政府的选民来使政府下台”是“违反宪法的”。印度两位前联邦部长、现任大学奖学金委员会主席德希穆克和现任旁遮普邦长加德吉尔分别批评推翻喀拉拉邦政府的运动。许多著名人士要求国大党在喀拉拉邦局势问题上遵守民主和宪法程序，这些人中包括前总督拉贾戈帕拉查里、喀拉拉邦表列种姓领袖维拉尤丹以及其他名流、作家、基督教人士等。维拉尤丹最近发表声明，谴责反对党派的煽动活动，他说，这是“近年来所听到的最不愉快的事情。”“印度斯坦时报”报道，一批著名的基督教领袖发表声明，号召喀拉拉邦的基督教徒注意喀拉拉邦政府提出的谈判建议，并同邦政府协商。“印度时报”也表示反对国大党的直接行动计划，它说：如果联邦政府在它所代表的政党为进行干涉部分地制造了条件之后进行干涉，那就是违反宪法的行为。德里的某些国大党地方组织，如亚格拉马图拉区的国大党区委会，呼吁国大党主席“不要加剧喀拉拉邦的危机”。
