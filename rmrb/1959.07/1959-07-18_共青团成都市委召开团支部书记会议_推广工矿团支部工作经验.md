    This newspaper reports: To mobilize and assist grassroots organizations of the Communist Youth League in factories and mines in Chengdu to better serve as assistants to the Party in production, the Chengdu Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League recently convened a meeting of CYL branch secretaries from industrial and mining enterprises to exchange experiences in CYL branch work.
    At the meeting, the CYL branch of the Product Workshop of the Fifth Workshop of Chengdu Jinjiang Machinery Factory and other units made typical speeches on how to do a good job in the grassroots work of the CYL. The experiences exchanged at the meeting proved that if the Communist Youth League organizations in factories and mines are to be good assistants to the Party, the CYL organizations must fully pay attention to the characteristics of youth being the most active, the most energetic, the most willing to learn, and the least conservative in their thinking. Under the unified leadership of the Party, they must closely cooperate with the trade union, actively carry out activities, and give full play to the youth's role as a shock force in production. All units that have done so have achieved good results, and as a result, the Party is satisfied and the youth are also satisfied. In May of this year, the CYL branch of the Product Workshop of the Fifth Workshop of Jinjiang Machinery Factory saw that the issue of how to complete the delivery of one thousand products was the most concerning and urgent issue for the Party to solve. The CYL branch suggested to the Party organization that they launch shock activities among the lathe workers, such as the thousand-minute competition, the product delivery championship, and the machine tool relay race, to give full play to the shock role of the youth. With the support of the Party organization, the CYL branch mobilized the vast number of young people to actively participate in these shock activities, making the CYL a powerful assistant to the Party in completing the particularly heavy tasks in May.
    The experiences introduced also showed that after the direction of the shock is determined, the Communist Youth League branch must firmly grasp the establishment of pacesetters and the cultivation of typical examples in order to inspire the youth's enthusiasm and set off a competition upsurge. Under the unified leadership of the Party branch, the CYL general branch of the rolling mill workshop of Chengdu Iron and Steel Plant cultivated Rolling Team C as an advanced team, and cooperated with the trade union organization to set off a competition among the three rolling teams, causing the output of steel per shift to increase from 200 bars to 526 bars. The CYL branch of the Third Workshop of Chengdu Leather Factory, focusing on the key to improving quality, vigorously publicized the deeds of CYL member Peng Guoyu, who had produced twenty-eight thousand pairs of leather shoes without any defective products for six years. They also cultivated seven outstanding quality experts, setting up quality benchmarks for the youth, which greatly inspired the youth's sense of responsibility for improving quality. These experiences all show that in production activities, if the CYL branch firmly grasps the important link of establishing pacesetters and cultivating typical examples, it can make the CYL's work practical, specific, vivid, and active.
    The CYL branch of the electromechanical workshop of Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant launched a "five knows" activity, targeting the problems of young apprentices' low technical skills and poor product quality. They invited veteran workers to give technical lessons to the apprentices, and provided pre-shift guidance. They also organized technicians and veteran workers to adopt methods such as roving guidance and irregular random testing to improve the apprentices' skills. This enabled the apprentices to change the situation in the past where they did not understand the use of insulating materials, did not understand the processing procedures, and did not understand the basic knowledge of electricity. As a result, the rework hours for transformers decreased from 395 hours in May to 20 hours in June. When the CYL branch of the Product Workshop of Jinjiang Machinery Factory launched the machine tool relay final, they formed a "tiger-fighting team" of young technicians to specifically solve the technical problems of the apprentices and guide the apprentices to improve tool clamps, realizing 81 items of technological innovation and promotion of advanced experience. This played a significant role in overfulfilling the workload. These experiences show that in production competitions and shock activities, the CYL must focus on technical guidance and cooperative relationships, and earnestly solve technical problems in production, creating conditions and providing guarantees for the youth to play a shock role.
    The meeting finally called on the grassroots organizations of the CYL in industrial and mining enterprises throughout the city to fully use and enrich these experiences under the leadership of the Party, so as to better play the role of the Party's assistant.

    共青团成都市委召开团支部书记会议
    推广工矿团支部工作经验
    本报讯　为了动员和帮助成都市厂矿企业共青团的基层组织在生产中更好地给党当好助手，共青团成都市委最近召开了全市工矿企业单位团的支部书记会议，交流团支部工作的经验。
    会上，成都锦江机器厂五车间产品工段团支部等单位作了怎样作好团的基层工作的典型发言。会议交流的经验证明：在厂矿企业方面的共青团组织要当好党的助手，共青团组织必须充分注意青年最积极、最有生气、最肯学习、最少保守思想的特点，在党的统一领导下，与工会密切配合，积极开展活动，充分发挥青年在生产中的突击作用。凡是这样做了的单位，就取得了很好的效果，结果党满意，青年也满意。锦江机器厂五车间产品工段团支部，在今年5月间，看到党最关心、最迫切需要解决的问题是如何完成一千项产品交付的任务，团支部就向党组织建议，在车工中展开千分钟竞赛、产品交付冠军赛、机床接力赛等突击活动，以充分发挥青年的突击作用。在党组织支持下，团支部发动广大青年积极参加了这些突击活动，使团在完成5月份特别繁重的任务中成为党的有力助手。
    在介绍的经验中还说明了，在突击方向确定以后，共青团支部要紧紧抓住树立标兵，培养典型，才能鼓舞青年的干劲。掀起竞赛热潮。成都钢铁厂轧钢车间团总支，在党支部的统一领导下，培养轧钢丙班为先进班组，配合工会组织掀起轧钢的三个班你追我赶的竞赛，使班产钢材从二百条提高到五百二十六条。成都制革厂三车间团支部，针对提高质量的关键，大力宣传六年如一日，二十八万双皮鞋不出废品的共青团员彭国玉的事迹。又培养了七名优等质量能手，给青年树立了优等质量标兵，大大地鼓舞了青年提高质量的责任心。这些经验都说明了，在生产活动中，如果团支部紧紧抓住树立标兵，培养典型这个重要环节，就能使团的工作落实、具体、生动、活跃。
    成都量具刃具厂机电车间团支部针对青年学工技术低，产品质量不高的问题，开展“五知道”的活动。他们邀请老师傅给学工上技术课，作好班前指导；并组织技工和老师傅，采取巡回辅导、不定期抽测等办法，提高学工的技术。这就使学工改变了过去不懂得绝缘材料的使用，不懂得加工规程，不懂得电的基本知识的状况，使变压器的返工工时从5月份的三百九十五小时下降到6月份的二十小时。锦江机器厂产品工段团支部，在开展机床接力决赛的时候，把青年技工组成打虎队，专门解决学工的技术疑难问题，指导学工改进刀夹具，实现技术革新和推广先进经验八十一项。这对于超额完成工作量起了不小的作用。这些经验说明了，团在生产竞赛和突击活动中，要抓好技术指导和协作配合关系，切实认真地解决生产上的技术问题，为青年发挥突击作用创造条件，提供保证。
    会议最后号召全市工矿企业团的基层组织，在党的领导下，充分运用和丰富这些经验，更好地发挥党的助手作用。
