To continuously improve labor productivity and continuously reduce production costs is the fundamental principle of a socialist economy. In the era of individual economy in agricultural production, farmers' production was dominated by rampant nature and even more rampant markets. Production costs could not be controlled, let alone reduced. Only in the era of collective economy, when the socialist economy controls all the economic lifelines of the country, and an economic accounting system is established in agricultural production, does it become possible to continuously reduce production costs. But possible does not equal reality. To transform possibility into reality requires a series of ideological and organizational efforts. The Xingwang Brigade of Huangshajie Commune in Yueyang County, Hunan Province, has set an example in this regard. Through careful calculation, they have opened up new sources of income and reduced expenditures in all aspects, and the actual cost for the whole year will be reduced by 74% compared with last year. This is a significant figure. If all production teams can do this, reducing expenditures and increasing income, it would be equivalent to doubling the harvest. Isn't this something to be very happy about?

    二倍的收获
    不断地提高劳动生产率，不断地降低生产成本，是社会主义经济的根本原则。在农业生产的个体经济时代，农民的生产受着横暴的自然和更横暴的市场的支配，生产成本无从掌握，更难以降低。只有到了集体经济时代，社会主义的经济掌握了国家所有的经济命脉，在农业生产中建立了经济核算制度，不断地降低生产成本就成为可能的了。但可能并不等于现实。要使可能转变成现实，要经过一系列的思想工作和组织工作。湖南岳阳县黄沙街公社兴旺大队在这方面树立了先行的榜样。他们精打细算，从各方面开源节流，全年实际成本将比去年降低百分之七十四。这是一个不小的数字。如果所有的生产队都能这样做，支出降低，收入增加，不啻有了二倍的收获。这不是十分可喜的事吗？
