Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 26th: Workers in various forest areas of Heilongjiang Province are vigorously collecting rosin to refine rosin. In the first half of July alone, more than 50 tons of rosin were collected in various places, and more than 7 tons of rosin were refined.

After the Heilongjiang Provincial Forestry Department held an on-site rosin production meeting in late June, forestry bureaus and forest farms throughout the province further arranged for rosin tapping and refining. The Langxiang Forestry Bureau increased its professional rosin tapping workers from 120 to 250, and the rosin tapping volume increased by more than 20% compared with late June. Many forestry bureaus came up with various methods to increase rosin production. Leading cadres and technicians of the Dafeng Forestry Bureau went deep into the front line to mobilize the masses to research and create a new rosin tapping method of "large peeling and hanging boxes," which can increase rosin production by more than 60%.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 25th: The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which is rich in rosin, is seizing the current peak season of rosin collection to vigorously tap rosin.

Party committees at all levels in the Autonomous Region have recently strengthened their leadership over rosin production and rationally arranged labor. Therefore, even during the busy summer harvest, it is still possible to ensure that a certain amount of labor is engaged in rosin tapping. Many places have also established professional rosin tapping teams. In order to improve rosin tapping efficiency, all localities have strengthened technical guidance on rosin tapping. Lingui, Quanxian, Pingle, Gongcheng and other counties have successively held rosin tapping experience exchange meetings, and the rosin tapping efficiency has generally increased from 300 trees per day to 350 to 500 trees.

Commercial departments in various places have also sent cadres to assist communes in arranging rosin production and solving technical and tool problems, and have set up collection points in a timely manner.

    松脂采集工作进展迅速
    据新华社哈尔滨26日电　黑龙江省各林区职工大力采集松脂炼制松香，仅在7月上中旬，各地采集的松脂就达五十多吨，炼制出松香七吨多。
    6月下旬黑龙江省林业部门召开松香生产现场会议以后，全省各林业局和林场都进一步安排了采脂和松香炼制的工作。朗乡林业局专业采脂工人由一百二十人增加到二百五十人，采脂量比6月下旬提高20％以上。许多林业局想出各种办法，提高采脂量，大丰林业局领导干部和技术人员，深入现场发动群众研究创造了“大剥皮挂盒”的新采脂法，采脂量可以提高60％以上。
    据新华社南宁25日电　盛产松脂的广西僮族自治区，正抓紧当前采脂旺季大力采割松脂。
    自治区各级党委最近都加强了对松脂生产的领导，合理安排了劳动力，因此虽然在夏收大忙期间，仍能保证有一定的劳动力从事采脂工作。许多地方还建立了专业采脂队。为了提高采脂效率，各地都加强采脂技术指导。临桂、全县、平乐、恭城等县曾先后召开采脂经验交流会，采脂效率一般已由每天采割三百株增加到三百五十至五百株。
    各地商业部门也派出干部协助公社安排松脂生产和解决技术、工具等问题，并且及时设点收购。
