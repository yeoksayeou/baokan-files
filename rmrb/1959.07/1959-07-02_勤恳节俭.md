Diligence and Thrift

Ji Shufa, Deputy Secretary of the General Branch of the Tang’erli Production Brigade in Ba County, is selfless. Whether in a war environment or a peaceful environment, whether serving in a leadership position or as an ordinary farmer, he always maintains the true qualities of hard work and simplicity.

Qiu Shilong, a member of the Party Committee of Banpu People's Commune in Guanyun County and Secretary of the Sixth Brigade Branch, works and labors simultaneously, closely integrating work and labor. He has never stopped for more than ten years, earning the respect and love of the people.

These two grassroots Party cadres share common characteristics: selfless labor, love for the masses, simple living, and always maintaining the true qualities of a Communist Party member who shares weal and woe with the people. They are also good "housekeepers." Ji Shufa said, "The masses want us to manage the household, so we should diligently manage this household well." They are good cadres who wholeheartedly serve the people. Their spirit of diligence and thrift is worthy of our learning.

    勤恳节俭
    霸县堂二里生产大队总支副书记纪树发，大公无私，无论在战争环境或者和平环境，无论担任领导工作或者当普通农民，始终保持着艰苦朴素的本色。
    灌云县板浦人民公社党委委员兼第六大队支部书记丘士龙，一边工作，一边劳动，把工作和劳动密切结合，十多年来从未间断，得到了人民群众的尊敬和热爱。
    这两位党的基层干部，共同的特点是：忘我劳动，热爱群众，生活朴素，永远保持了共产党员与人民群众同甘共苦的本色。他们二人又都是好的“管家人”。纪树发说，“群众要我们管家，我们就应当勤勤恳恳地把这个家管理好。”他们是全心全意地为人民服务的好干部。他们的勤恳节俭之风值得我们学习。
