Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, July 23rd. The main body of Baotou Steel's No. 1 Blast Furnace has begun bricklaying. At 2:30 AM on the 18th, construction workers, with the help of Soviet experts and Wuhan Iron and Steel workers, laid the first giant carbon brick, more than three meters long and weighing more than 700 kilograms, into the bottom of the blast furnace. Construction workers are working day and night inside the blast furnace body, and by the 22nd, they had completed the laying of four layers of carbon bricks.

The bricklaying workload of No. 1 Blast Furnace is very large, with more than 2,600 tons of carbon bricks and high-alumina bricks alone. In order to complete this arduous and complex task, the Baotou Steel Refractory Company has transferred all of its main technical forces to the main body of the blast furnace to support the Refractory Team 2, which is responsible for the bricklaying of the blast furnace. Wuhan Iron and Steel has also sent 18 refractory workers to support the bricklaying project.

Since entering July, the builders on the construction site of the Baotou Steel blast furnace have been working hard and cleverly, which has significantly accelerated the progress of various projects. Now, the great blast furnace is fully equipped and imposing. The thick gas pipeline at the top of the furnace extends diagonally downwards, passes through the gravity dust collector, and is already connected to two tall gas scrubbing towers. The installation of equipment for the blast furnace inclined bridge and the skip car pit is nearing completion. The winch on the inclined bridge has been installed and is preparing for trial operation.

    包钢一号高炉开始砌砖
    新华社包头23日电  包钢一号高炉本体开始砌砖筑炉。18日早晨二时半，筑炉工人在苏联专家和武钢工人帮助下，把第一块长三米多、重七百多公斤的巨型炭砖，砌进了高炉炉底。筑炉工人在高炉炉体里日夜猛干，到22日止已经砌完四层炭砖。
    一号高炉的砌砖工程量很大，光是炭砖和高铝砖就有两千六百多吨。包钢筑炉公司为了完成这一艰巨复杂的任务，把全公司的主要技术力量都调到高炉本体上来，支援担任高炉砌砖任务的筑炉二队。武钢也派来十八名筑炉工人支援砌砖工程。
    进入7月份以来，包钢高炉工地上的建设者苦干巧干，使各项工程进度显著加快。现在，大高炉全身披挂，威风凛凛。炉顶的粗大煤气管道斜伸下来，经过重力除尘器，已经同两座高大的煤气洗涤塔连接起来。高炉斜桥和料车坑的设备安装工程接近完成了，斜桥上的卷扬机已经安好，正在准备试运转。
