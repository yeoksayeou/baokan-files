Having achieved a great summer harvest, all parts of the country are continuing to exert their utmost efforts, advancing on the crest of victory, and striving for a great autumn harvest.

The planting area for autumn grain crops accounts for more than three-quarters of the annual grain planting area, and most of them are high-yield crops, such as rice, corn, millet, and potatoes. Other crops such as cotton and oilseeds (except rapeseed) will also mature and be harvested in late autumn. Therefore, striving for a great autumn harvest is the key to continuing the great leap forward on the agricultural front this year.

There are many favorable conditions for striving for a great autumn harvest: the people's communes have been further consolidated after rectification, many tasks have been put on track, the working style and working methods of cadres at all levels have also been significantly improved, and relatively successful experience has been gained in comprehensively and rationally implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture." In addition, the summer harvest is already in hand, and autumn crops are generally growing well. As long as the masses are mobilized and their energy is boosted, a great autumn harvest will definitely be achieved.

To achieve a great autumn harvest, it is first necessary to seize the opportunity and complete the summer planting tasks in a way that is plentiful, fast, and good. This year, the progress of summer planting in most areas has been faster and the quality better. However, in some areas, due to the impact of the previous period of rush harvesting or drought, a considerable amount of autumn field area has not been planted. With "Great Heat" approaching and only about twenty days left until "Autumn Begins," the summer planting season is coming to an end. Therefore, it is necessary to organize forces to rush planting and strive to complete the planting plan. Unused "four sides" and "ten edges" open spaces should also be mobilized for commune members to plant vegetables, miscellaneous grains, and so on. Planting more is for harvesting more, and in planting more, it is necessary to select crops with relatively short growing periods, such as millet and buckwheat, according to the specific conditions of the local climate and varieties, so that every mu planted is harvested; there should be appropriate deep plowing and appropriate base fertilizer; attention should be paid to eliminating or reducing third-class seedlings during sowing; more grain crops should be planted, and more cash crops should also be planted, to achieve the goal of comprehensive and increased harvests. On the other hand, we must look forward and backward, not only to plant more and harvest more in this season, but also to plant more and harvest more in the next season; not only to plant as much grain and oil crops as possible now, and strive to produce more grain and oil, but also to take care of the multiple harvests of wheat and rapeseed next year. In short, it is necessary to adhere to the principle put forward by the Party Central Committee of striving to plant another season of crops without affecting the autumn planting of wheat or green manure, in order to expand the area of autumn fields. To harvest more, it is not only necessary to plant more, but also to strive for high yields. Therefore, on the basis of planting general fields well, it is also necessary to continue to carry out large-scale high-yield campaigns in high-yield areas and high-yield plots, and use the method of doing a good job in high-yield fields to guide general fields to increase yield per unit area.

In areas where summer planting has basically ended, it is necessary to quickly shift the main forces to field management. Whether it is rice or cotton, from now until maturity, it is necessary to apply a certain amount of fertilizer to meet the needs of crop growth and development and achieve high yields. However, in some areas, there is not much fertilizer and the quality is not high, which cannot meet the requirements of autumn crops; and now is a good season for accumulating and producing fertilizer. Therefore, a field management campaign centered on fertilizer should be launched. In addition to using green grass to make compost, it is also necessary to start basic fertilizer construction. Developing animal husbandry is one of the best ways to develop basic fertilizer construction. There has always been a saying among farmers that "one animal is a small fertilizer factory." Attention should be paid to the quality of fertilizer accumulation and production, and not simply pursuing the quantity of fertilizer. If the fertilizer efficiency is very low, no matter how much there is, it will not have much effect on increasing production. On the contrary, it will waste too much effort in accumulating and transporting fertilizer and increase the degree of labor tension.

We say that field management should be centered on fertilizer, but fertilizer does not override everything. In addition to fertilizer, it is also necessary to carry out timely inter-tillage, weeding, and prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests. Most of the major autumn crops are inter-tillage crops. From the perspective of crop growth habits and high-yield laws, timely inter-tillage and weeding are required. Weeds are the main "enemies" of crops. The large-scale growth of weeds in the field will not only deprive the soil of a large amount of nutrients, but also affect the development of crop roots and the growth of plants. Weeding must be done as early as possible. "Weeding one day earlier is better than applying fertilizer once." We must take advantage of the sunny weather to organize a blitz to eliminate weeds when they are growing in large numbers after rain. Weeding work can also be combined with fertilizer accumulation and production work. The prevention and control of diseases and insect pests of various crops must also be carried out as early as possible. In addition, all preparations must be made to ensure that all possible natural disasters are overcome.

After the end of summer planting, some necessary and reasonable adjustments should be made to the arrangement of labor. During this period, in addition to field management, it is also necessary to develop diversified operations and do a good job in winter planting preparations. Among them, diversified operations in particular require more labor. Therefore, if attention is not paid to comprehensive and reasonable arrangements, labor will still be very tight. Taking care of field management will prevent the development of diversified operations and winter planting preparations; or taking care of diversified operations will prevent field management and winter planting preparations. All of this is not conducive to striving for a great autumn harvest this year and a continued great leap forward in agriculture next year.

To strive for a great autumn harvest, it is also necessary to strengthen the leadership of the Party. Not only is the planting area of ​​major autumn crops large, but also because new measures such as rational close planting have been widely adopted, many new problems will inevitably arise during the crop growing season. At present, it is also a season when natural disasters occur frequently. Therefore, the first secretary of the county party committee must fully lead agricultural production, go deep into the fields, and go to the front line of production to discover and solve problems. Only when the responsible comrades of the Party go deep down can they better implement the Party's policies and further mobilize the masses' enthusiasm for production and strive for a great autumn harvest.

    乘胜前进
    全国各地在取得了夏季大丰收以后，正在继续鼓足干劲，乘胜前进，为争取秋季农业大丰收而奋斗。
    秋季粮食作物的播种面积，占全年粮食播种面积的四分之三以上，而且大部是高产作物，如水稻、玉米、谷子、薯类等。其它像棉花、油料（除油菜外）等等，也都在秋末才能成熟收获。因此，争取秋季大丰收，就成为农业战线上今年继续大跃进的关键。
    争取秋季大丰收的有利条件是很多的：人民公社经过整顿进一步巩固了，很多工作都走上了轨道，各级干部的工作作风和工作方法也有了显著改进，在全面合理贯彻农业八字宪法方面，取得了比较成功的经验，再加夏季丰收已经到手，秋收作物普遍生长良好，只要把群众动员起来，鼓足干劲，就一定能够争取秋季农业大丰收。
    要实现秋季大丰收，首先要抓紧时机，又多、又快、又好地完成夏种任务。今年大部地区夏种进度较快，质量较好，但是也有部分地区由于前一段时间突击夏收或者干旱的影响，还有相当数量的秋田面积没有种上。目前“大暑”将到，离“立秋”还有二十来天时间，夏季播种已到最后时期，因此必须组织力量，突击抢种，争取完成播种计划。没有利用的“四旁”、“十边”空地，也要发动社员种上蔬菜、杂粮等等。多种是为了多收，多种中也就要根据当地气候和品种的具体情况，选择生长期比较短的作物，如谷子和荞麦等，作到种一亩收一亩；要有适当的深耕，适当的基肥；在播种时就注意消灭三类苗或减少三类苗；要多种粮食作物也要多种经济作物，达到全面多收的目的。另一方面，要瞻前顾后，既要做到这一季多种多收，又要做到下一季多种多收，既要在现在尽一切可能多种粮食、油料作物，争取多产粮食和油料，也要照顾到明年小麦和油菜的多种多收。总之，要坚持党中央所提出的在不影响秋季种麦、不影响种绿肥的条件下，争取再种一季庄稼的原则，来扩大秋田的面积。要多收，不仅要多种，还要争取高产。因此，还要在种好一般田的基础上，继续开展丰产片、丰产方的大面积丰产运动，并且用搞好丰产田的方法来指导一般田提高单位面积产量。
    在夏种已经基本结束的地区需要把主要力量迅速转到田间管理上来。无论水稻或棉花，从现在到成熟，都还需要追施一定数量的肥料，才能满足作物生长发育和达到丰产的需要。但是现在有些地区肥料不多，质量不高，不能满足秋季作物的要求；而现在正是积肥、造肥的大好季节，因此，应该开展一个以肥料为中心的田间管理运动。除了利用青草沤肥以外，还要着手肥料的基本建设。发展畜牧就是发展肥料基本建设的一个最好的方法，在农民中从来有着“一头牲畜是一个小肥料厂”的说法。积肥造肥要注意质量，不要单纯追求肥料的数量。如果肥效很低，数量再多，也起不了多少增产的作用，反而过多的花费了积肥运肥的力量，增加劳力紧张的程度。
    我们说田间管理要以肥料为中心，并不是肥料压倒一切，除了肥料以外，还要及时进行中耕锄草，防治病虫害等工作。大秋作物中，大部分是中耕作物，从作物生长习性和丰产规律来看，都需要及时进行中耕锄草。杂草是庄稼的主要“敌人”。田间杂草的大量滋长，不仅会夺取土壤中大量养分，而且会影响作物根系的发育和植株的生长，必须及早锄草。“早锄一天草，赛追一次肥”。要趁雨后杂草大量生长的时候，抢晴天组织突击消灭。锄草工作还可以和积肥制肥工作结合起来。对于各种作物的病虫害也必须及早防治消灭。此外，要充分做好一切准备，保证战胜可能发生的各种自然灾害。
    夏种结束以后，劳动力的安排应当作一些必要的合理的调整。在这个时期，除了田间管理外，还要开展多种经营，做好冬种准备工作。其中特别是多种经营，需要较多的劳动力。因此，如果不注意全面合理的安排，劳动力仍然会十分紧张，顾了田间管理，顾不了多种经营和冬种准备；或者顾了多种经营，顾不了田间管理和冬种准备。这都是不利于争取今年秋季大丰收和明年农业继续大跃进的。
    争取秋季农业大丰收还必须加强党的领导，不仅大秋作物的种植面积大，而且因为普遍采用了合理密植等等新措施，作物生长期间，一定会出现许多新的问题。目前又正是自然灾害发生频繁的季节。因此，县委第一书记必须全力领导农业生产，深入田间，到生产最前线去发现问题、解决问题。也只有党的负责同志深入下去，才能更好地贯彻党的方针政策，进一步调动群众生产积极性，全力争取秋季大丰收。
