Xinhua News Agency, Rome, July 3rd: According to TASS, the Italian newspaper "Unità" published on July 1st a speech by the General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, Palmiro Togliatti, at a meeting of representatives of the Communist Party organization in Emilia province.

    In his speech, Togliatti, when talking about the current domestic situation in Italy, emphasized that a new situation is forming in Italy. He pointed out that the characteristic of this new situation is that economic prosperity has been replaced by economic recession. The ruling groups of big capital are trying to get rid of this situation; they vainly attempt to further become the masters who absolutely control the Italian economy. The Christian Democratic government currently relies entirely on these ruling groups of big capital.

    Togliatti then pointed out that representatives of the bourgeois groups are demanding that the Christian Democratic Party repeat what happened in France not long ago: eliminate parliamentary democratic freedoms and establish a reactionary dictatorship. He emphasized that such measures being taken or planned by the ruling party are encountering increasingly stubborn resistance.

    Togliatti stressed that now, both in cities and rural areas, there are objective conditions that can prompt the petty bourgeoisie – small landowners and small business owners – to break away from the Christian Democratic Party.

    Togliatti then talked about the working class and its role in the struggle for national life. He pointed out that the working class should not only fight for higher wages and improved working conditions. In the current situation, it can and should promote national progress, solve problems related to national progress, including putting forward opinions on solving complex problems related to arranging the national economic life.

    Togliatti emphasized that the Italian Communist Party is an indispensable and huge force in the Italian people's struggle for democracy and peace. Only by overcoming anti-communist ideological prejudices can the prospect of smashing the monopoly of the Christian Democratic Party and establishing a new majority faction in Italy be opened up.

    陶里亚蒂分析意大利局势
    执政党反动阴谋遭到顽强反对
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社罗马讯：意大利“团结报”1日刊登了意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂在艾米里亚省共产党组织代表会议上的讲话。
    陶里亚蒂在讲话中谈到意大利当前的国内形势时强调说，在意大利，一种新的局面正在形成。他指出，这种新的局面的特点是，经济的顺境已经被经济萧条所代替。大资本统治集团力图摆脱这种局面；它们妄想进一步成为绝对控制意大利经济的主人。天主教民主党政府目前完全依靠这些大资本统治集团。
    陶里亚蒂接着指出，资产阶级集团的代表人物要求天主教民主党重演不久前在法国发生过的事情：消灭议会的民主自由，建立反动的独裁制度。他着重指出，执政党正在采取或打算采取的这类措施遭遇到越来越顽强的抵抗。
    陶里亚蒂强调说，现在，城市和农村中都具备着促使中小资产者阶层——小土地所有者和小企业主——脱离天主教民主党的客观条件。
    陶里亚蒂接着谈到工人阶级和它在国家生活斗争中的作用。他指出，工人阶级应当不仅仅为提高工资和改善劳动条件而斗争。在当前的情况下，它能够，而且应该促使国家进步，解决同国家进步有关的问题，包括就解决有关安排国家经济生活的复杂问题提出意见。
    陶里亚蒂强调指出，意大利共产党是意大利人民争取民主、和平的斗争所不可缺少的一支巨大力量。只有克服反共的思想偏见才能打开在意大利粉碎天主教民主党的垄断和建立新的多数派的前景。
