On June 12th, just as dawn broke, Tang Jigui, the County Party Secretary of Linxiang County, Hunan Province, stepped into the pig farm and saw a wide and long room housing sows, boars, piglets, and feeder pigs. The pig breeder, Wu Xiaoma, was busy feeding the pigs... Tang Jigui took a look and quickly walked to Wu Xiaoma's side.

"Busy, Auntie Wu! Let me help you with the feeding," he said, reaching for the feed ladle in Wu Xiaoma's hand.

"No! Secretary Tang." Wu Xiaoma held the ladle tightly, refusing to give it to Tang Jigui: "In April, you came to our team as a commune member and also as a cook. Today you're here as a pig breeder. You're truly a 'three-role' secretary who isn't afraid of hardship! Feeding the pigs is our own job, you just give us some guidance." It turned out that Tang Jigui had already become friends with the people at the pig farm. Upon meeting, everyone could call out each other's name.

At Tang Jigui's repeated requests, Wu Xiaoma reluctantly handed the ladle to him.

Tang Jigui took the ladle and scooped the pig feed from the bucket, pouring it into the feeding troughs. He then pinched and examined the feed, removing any small stones or tough vegetable roots before letting the pigs eat. He fed one pig after another, working for over two hours before he and Wu Xiaoma finished feeding all fifty-two pigs.

After breakfast, Tang Jigui's pig breeding work was chopping pig feed. He was chopping away when suddenly Wu Xiaoma ran from the pigpen to Tang Jigui and said: "Secretary Tang, a litter of piglets, all seven of them are having diarrhea with white stool, what should we do?" "This is a type of white scours. There is a way to cure it. Just mix Sulfaguanidine tablets and bismuth subnitrate tablets into a fine powder with cold boiled water, not too thin, not too thick, and feed it to the pigs twice a day. It can be cured in two or three days." Tang Jigui was able to prescribe this treatment because he had learned the skills of treating sick pigs and giving vaccinations from veterinarians as early as March of last year. In the past year, he had given vaccinations to two hundred and ten pigs in the Nie Shi Commune and cured many sick pigs. "Do you have this kind of medicine?" "Yes, I have this kind of medicine in my health kit." In fact, Tang Jigui's health kit not only contained this medicine, but also penicillin, compound aspirin, sulfathiazole tablets, and over twenty other medicines for treating pig diseases and giving vaccinations. At the same time, he also brought syringes, thermometers, sterilizers, magnifying glasses, enema bags, hemostatic forceps, cotton wool, and other instruments.

Soon, the two of them went to the pigpen. Wu Xiaoma mixed the medicine with water and handed it to Tang Jigui, then caught a piglet in her arms. Tang Jigui used a large brush to apply the medicine to the pig's mouth, stroke by stroke. They fed one after another, and in the blink of an eye, they finished feeding the seven piglets.

The sun set in the west, and the night grew dark. All eight pig breeders at the pig farm had finished work. Tang Jigui was still busy chopping pig feed... That day, he worked a full twelve hours. Under his leadership, everyone was full of energy. Li Jinsheng, who used to find only four baskets of pig feed a day, found six baskets that day. At this time, Tang Jigui, at everyone's persuasion, finished chopping the last handful of pig feed and put down the grass-cutting knife. He got up and walked to Li Xinzhou and said: "Director Li, are there any difficulties in your farm that haven't been resolved?" "Everything is fine. It's just that pig feed is relatively difficult." Tang Jigui smiled: "Today, I have already discovered this problem, and it seems that there is a way to solve it: one is to use the open space in front of and behind the house to expand the existing feed land; the other is to plant water hyacinth or propagate wild water chestnut grass in the large pond in front of the pig farm. Wouldn't that solve the problem?" (Attached picture)

    当饲养员的一天
    吕彪
    6月12日，天刚亮，中共湖南临湘县县委书记汤吉贵，一跨进养猪场的门坎，就看到一间又宽又长的房间内，分别养着母猪、公猪、仔猪和架子猪。饲养员吴孝妈正在忙着给猪喂食……。汤吉贵看了一下，就连忙走到吴孝妈的身旁：
    “忙呀，吴娭毑！让我来帮你喂吧。”他说完就伸手去接吴孝妈手里的猪食瓢。
    “不！汤书记。”吴孝妈紧握着瓢，不肯给汤吉贵：“4月份你来我们队里当社员又当炊事员，今天又来当饲养员，真是个不怕吃苦的三员书记呀！喂猪是我们自己的事，你指导指导就行了。”原来汤吉贵和这个养猪场的人员，早已结成了朋友。一见面，谁也能叫出谁的名字。
    在汤吉贵的再三恳求下，吴孝妈没奈何，只好把瓢让给汤吉贵了。
    汤吉贵接过瓢来，就把桶里的猪食，一瓢瓢地倒到猪食槽里，再用手捏了又捏，看了又看，把食槽里的小石子、硬菜根捡得一干二净，再给猪吃。他这样喂了一头又一头，一直干了两个多钟头，才和吴孝妈喂完了五十二头猪。
    早饭后，汤吉贵的饲养工作是切猪菜，他正切着切着，忽然吴孝妈从猪栏里跑到汤吉贵的面前说：“汤书记，场里一窝猪崽，七头都屙白屎，该怎么办呢？”“这是一种白痢病，有办法治好，只要把磺胺呱片和次硝酸铋片混合用冷开水拌成细粉沫，不稀不浓，每天给猪喂两次，两、三天就可治好。”汤吉贵能开这个处方，也是有原因的。他早在去年3月间，就向兽医们学会了给猪治病和打防疫针的本领。去年一年，他就在聂市公社给二百一十头猪打过防疫针，并治好了不少的病猪。“有这种药吗？”“有，我的保健箱里有这种药。”其实，汤吉贵的保健箱里不光是有这种药，还有盘尼西林，复方阿司匹林，磺胺噻唑片等二十多种诊治猪病和打防疫针的药。同时，他还带来了注射器、体温器、煮沸器、放大镜、洗肠器、止血钳子、药棉等等器械用品。
    一会，两人同时走到猪栏里。吴孝妈用水把药丸子调好了，交给汤吉贵，就把小猪捉到自己的身上。汤吉贵用一枝大毛笔，把药一笔一笔地送到猪的嘴里。他两人喂了一只又一只，一眨眼就给七只小猪喂完了药。
    日落西山，夜色沉沉。养猪场的八个饲养员都收工了。汤吉贵仍在忙着切猪菜。……这一天，他足足劳动了十二个小时。大家在他的带动下，都干劲十足，李金生往日一天只寻得四篓猪菜，这天却寻了六篓。这时，汤吉贵在大家的劝阻下，切完了最后一把猪菜，才放下切草刀。他起身走到李新洲面前说：“李场长，你们场里还有什么困难没解决吗？”“一切都好。就是猪饲料比较困难。”汤吉贵笑了一下：“今天，我已发觉了这个问题，看来还是有办法解决的：一是利用屋前屋后的空地，把现有饲料地扩大；二是把养猪场门前的一口大塘，全部种上水浮莲或繁殖野菱角草。这样，问题不就解决了么。”（附图片）
