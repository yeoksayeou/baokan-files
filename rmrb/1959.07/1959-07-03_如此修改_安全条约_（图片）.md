So-Called Revisions to the "Security Treaty"
Editor's Note: In May of this year, the Nobusuke Kishi group published an outline of the Liberal Democratic Party's revisions to the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," engaging in shameless deceptive propaganda targeting the Japanese people. On May 17th, the Japanese "Akahata" (Red Flag) newspaper published a series of cartoons exposing this outline vividly. Our newspaper has selected several of these cartoons for publication below, accompanied by brief explanatory text based on the original newspaper's materials.

	Tightening the Screws
	The Nobusuke Kishi group says: Revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is to strengthen the "U.S.-Japan Security System" and future cooperative relations between the two countries, so as to place the relationship between the two countries on a long-term stable foundation.

	"Joint Defense"
	The Nobusuke Kishi group says: When U.S. troops stationed on Japanese territory are attacked, Japan can conduct "joint defense" with the United States, which does not violate Article 9 of the Constitution regarding the prohibition of Japanese combat.

	"Collective Self-Defense"
	The Nobusuke Kishi group says: Implementing military cooperation with the United States, when preventing armed attacks by other countries, allows for the exercise of the right of self-defense in the form of "collective self-defense."

	Opening a Breach
	The Nobusuke Kishi group says: When Japanese security is threatened by "indirect aggression," in order to obtain assistance from U.S. troops, it is necessary for Japan and the United States to take measures such as consultation.

	Forward March
	The Nobusuke Kishi group says: In order to gradually enrich Japan's defense capabilities, it is necessary to continuously strengthen the connection between Japan and the United States and establish a complete joint defense system.

    如此修改“安全条约”
    编者按　今年5月间岸信介集团发表了自由民主党修改日美“安全条约”纲要，对日本人民进行无耻的欺骗宣传。5月17日日本“赤旗报”发表连环漫画对这个纲要作了形象的揭露。本报选用数幅发表于下，并根据原报的材料，配了简短的文字说明。
    扭紧螺丝钉
    岸信介集团说：修改日美“安全条约”，是为了加强“日美安全保障体系”和今后日美两国的合作关系，以便把两国的关系置于长期稳定的基础上。
    “共同防卫”
    岸信介集团说：驻在日本领土上的美军受到攻击时，日本可以同美国进行“共同防卫”，这并不违反宪法第九条关于禁止日本作战的规定。
    “集体自卫”
    岸信介集团说：同美国实行军事合作，在阻止别国的武力攻击时，可以采取“集体自卫”的形式行使自卫权。
    开了一个口子
    岸信介集团说：当日本安全受到“间接侵略”的威胁时，为了取得美军的援助，日美两国有采取协商等措施的必要。
    开步走
    岸信介集团说：为了逐渐充实日本的防卫能力，必须不断加强日美之间的联系，建立完整的共同防卫体系。
