    “Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute” Poetry Collection
    Since the publication of Comrade Guo Moruo’s article on “Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute” and the staging of his new historical drama “Cai Wenji,” everyone has become interested in Cai Yan’s “Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute” and “Poem of Sorrow and Indignation,” hoping to read these works. The descriptions of the scenery beyond the Great Wall and the expression of deep sorrow in “Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute” can be said to be vivid and sincerely moving. It has bold imagination and a grand spirit. However, these two poems were previously included in some ancient poetry collections, and without annotations, they were not easy for the general reader to understand. Recently, Zhonghua Book Company has compiled these two poems, added some concise and popular annotations to the difficult words and phrases, and printed them into a small booklet entitled “Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute.”

    “胡笳十八拍”诗集
    自从郭沫若同志谈“胡笳十八拍”的文章发表，以及他的历史剧新作“蔡文姬”上演以后，大家对蔡琰的“胡笳十八拍”和“悲愤诗”引起了兴趣，希望能读一读这些作品。“胡笳十八拍”所描写的塞外风物，所表达的深沉的悲痛，可以说历历如绘、真挚动人。它具有大胆的设想，雄浑的气魄。但这两篇诗以前都收在古代的一些诗歌总集中，而且又没有注解，一般读者不容易读懂。最近，中华书局把这两篇诗加以编集，对难懂的词句作了一些简明通俗的注释，印成一本小册子，书名就叫“胡笳十八拍”。
