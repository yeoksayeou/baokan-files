    Take Action Early to Manage Autumn-Ripening Crops
    Sichuan Immediately Mobilizes Masses to Prevent Rice Lodging After Transplanting Mid-Season Rice
    Honghe County, Yunnan, Universally Arranges Seedlings in Rows, Timely Adding Strength and Encouragement to Third-Class Seedlings

    Chengdu, July 13 (by this newspaper) – Sichuan Province, while vigorously strengthening field management of autumn-ripening crops, has listed preventing rice lodging as an important measure for striving for a bumper rice harvest.

    Sichuan Province's forty million mu of mid-season rice were transplanted by mid-June. Based on several years of experience, especially the experience of this year's wheat bumper harvest, preventing lodging is one of the keys to striving for a greater rice harvest. Therefore, many places began to study the issue of preventing lodging in a timely manner even before transplanting was finished. Party committee secretaries in many counties and communes in Leshan, Fuling, Nanchong, and other regions personally went deep into the fields to lead the masses in analyzing the causes of lodging, summarizing past experiences in preventing lodging, mobilizing the masses to contribute ideas and suggestions, and formulating measures to prevent lodging.

    Based on the two fundamental causes of rice lodging, namely underdeveloped root systems and weak culm bases, all localities have first firmly grasped the "prevent lodging early" aspect. In preventing lodging during the seedling stage, all localities first focused on rational irrigation and drainage according to the characteristics of rice growth. In Wenjiang, Nanchong, Fuling, and other areas with abundant water sources, the experience of shallow water irrigation and draining and drying fields has been widely promoted. In summarizing the experience of draining and drying fields, Wenjiang Region found that this practice has a great effect on promoting root development, preventing excessive seedling growth, and helping the culms grow sturdily. Currently, this region has decided to drain and dry the fields three times during the rice tillering, stem elongation, and booting stages, and has already universally dried the fields for the first time. Paying attention to rational fertilization and avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilizer is another important measure taken by all localities to prevent lodging. In Mabian County, grass ash containing phosphorus and potassium fertilizer is applied to first-class seedlings that are growing strongly, and less or no other fertilizer is applied. More than 10,000 mu of rice with excessive nitrogen fertilizer has now been universally applied with grass ash. For seedlings that are too dense, weak seedlings are generally removed to facilitate ventilation and light transmission; for seedlings that are growing excessively, the method of cutting the leaf tips is generally adopted to allow the basal leaves to receive more sunlight. Other effective local methods and experiences for preventing lodging promoted in various places include going to the seedlings early in the morning to remove the dew, as well as pulling ropes, inserting branches, and building trellises.

    Kunming, July 13 (by this newspaper) – Honghe County, Yunnan Province, has conscientiously mobilized the masses to universally conduct seedling ranking, timely eliminate third-class seedlings, and strive for vigorous rice seedlings in every plot and a bumper harvest in every mu.

    After more than a month of hard work, the people of all ethnic groups in Honghe County completed the rice planting plan ahead of schedule, and the quality generally surpassed that of last year. Now, the seedlings are growing better than in the past.

    Because the seedlings were growing well, many cadres and the masses developed a sense of complacency, failing to see the existence of third-class seedlings, and field management did not keep up in a timely manner. Some fields were not weeded in time, fertilizer application was poor, and the seedlings began to turn yellow. In response to this situation, the Party committees of various communes adopted the method of "one calculation, two comparisons, and three rankings." In addition to summarizing the experiences and lessons from eliminating third-class seedlings last year and carefully calculating the increase in production, they also organized cadres and the masses to rank the fields plot by plot. The results of the ranking showed that out of 93,854 mu of paddy fields, 42,051 mu were first-class seedlings, accounting for 44.8%; 40,365 mu were second-class seedlings, accounting for 43%; and 11,438 mu were third-class seedlings, accounting for 12.2%. Through the ranking, the masses were educated and expressed their determination to add strength and encouragement to the third-class seedlings and upgrade them to second-class and first-class seedlings.

    After the masses were mobilized, all localities adopted the method of "three fixings, three seeings, and five combinations" to attack the third-class seedlings. The "three fixings" are fixing leaders, fixing labor, and fixing measures; the "three seeings" are seeing the organization, seeing the foundation, and seeing the seedlings; the "five combinations" are the combination of professional teams and mass-based shock work, the combination of weeding and topdressing, the combination of nitrogen fertilizer as the main component with nitrogen and phosphorus, the combination of weeding and pest control, and the combination of timely field drying and attention to irrigation. All six district cooperatives, fifty-four communes, and four hundred and eighty-nine production teams in the county fixed the directors and deputy directors to focus on weeding and third-class seedlings; they also fixed one thousand two hundred and seventy-five personnel to be specifically responsible for the weeding, topdressing, pest control, and irrigation of third-class seedlings. According to statistics, all 11,438 mu of third-class seedlings have now been weeded once, and 80% have been weeded twice. At the same time, the masses were mobilized to accumulate green manure early and late, prepare compost, burn ash fertilizer, and accumulate human waste, and the method of bringing fertilizer to work was universally promoted, accumulating a total of more than 18 million jin of fertilizer, and topdressing was applied to the fields according to the principle of "three seeings." By the end of last month, 8,890 mu of third-class seedlings had been topdressed with 16.49 million jin of fertilizer, generally 1,500 jin per mu, with some reaching 2,000 jin. After this shock campaign, the more than 8,000 mu of third-class seedlings that had been topdressed began to turn green and tiller. In Duojiao Commune, out of 247 mu of third-class seedlings, 201 mu have now been upgraded to second-class seedlings, growing from three or four seedlings to eight or nine seedlings. Seeing the green seedlings, the masses happily said, "People don't fool the crops, and the crops don't fool the people; as long as we are determined, the increase in production is guaranteed." Now, the commune members are continuing to exert their efforts, striving to eliminate third-class seedlings and achieve a greater bumper harvest. (Attached pictures)

### 趁早动手管好秋熟作物  四川栽完中稻立即发动群众防止水稻倒伏  云南红河县普遍进行苗棵排队及时给三类苗添劲加油

    趁早动手管好秋熟作物
    四川栽完中稻立即发动群众防止水稻倒伏
    云南红河县普遍进行苗棵排队及时给三类苗添劲加油
    本报成都13日电　四川省在大力加强秋熟作物的田间管理中，把防止水稻倒伏列为争取水稻大丰收的一项重要措施。
    四川省四千万亩中稻，到6月中旬就栽插完毕。根据几年来的经验，特别是今年小麦丰收的经验，防止倒伏是争取水稻更大丰收的关键之一。因此，许多地方在栽插尚未结束的时候就及时研究了防倒伏的问题。乐山、涪陵、南充等专区许多县、公社的党委书记都亲自深入田间，领导群众分析倒伏原因，总结过去防倒伏经验，发动群众献计献策，制定防倒伏的措施。
    根据水稻倒伏形成的两个根本原因，即根系不发达和禾秆基部软弱，各地在防倒伏中首先紧紧抓住“防倒要早”这一环节。各地在苗期防倒伏中，首先按照水稻生长的特点大抓合理排灌。温江、南充、涪陵等水源充足的地区，都广泛地推广了浅水灌溉和排水晒田的经验。温江专区在总结排水晒田经验中，发现这种做法对促进根系发育，制止苗叶徒长，帮助禾秆茁壮有很大作用。目前这个专区已决定在水稻发蔸、圆秆、含苞等时期放水晒田三次，并已普遍晒田第一次。注意合理施肥，避免氮肥过多是各地采取的防倒伏的另一个重要措施。马边县对于一类苗生长健壮的，只施含磷钾肥的草木灰，少施或不施其他肥。目前氮肥过多的一万多亩水稻已普遍施了草木灰。对禾苗过密的，一般都除去弱苗，以利通风透光；对秧苗徒长的，一般采取剪叶尖的办法，使基本叶片得到更多的阳光。各地推广的行之有效的群众防倒伏的土办法土经验，还有清早赶去秧苗上的露水以及拉绳、插枝、搭架等。
    本报昆明13日电　云南省红河县认真发动群众，普遍进行苗棵排队，及时消灭三类苗，力争丘丘禾苗茁壮，亩亩丰收。
    红河县各族人民，经过一个多月的苦战，提前节令完成了水稻栽种计划，质量一般都超过去年，现在，苗棵长得比过去好。
    由于苗棵长得好，不少干部和群众产生了自满情绪，看不到三类苗的存在，田间管理没有及时跟上，有些田薅锄不及时，追肥差，苗棵开始发黄。根据这种情况，各公社党委采取了一算二比、三排队的办法，除总结去年消灭三类苗的经验教训、细算增产账外，还组织干部群众到田间丘丘块块排队。排队结果，发现九万三千八百五十四亩稻田中，一类苗有四万二千零五十一亩，占44.8％；二类苗四万零三百六十五亩，占43％；三类苗一万一千四百三十八亩，占12.2％。通过排队，教育了群众，纷纷表示要给三类苗添劲加油，要三类苗升级为二类、一类苗。
    群众发动起来后，各地都采取三定、三看、五结合的办法，向三类苗开火。三定是定领导、定劳力、定措施；三看是看组织、看底子、看苗棵；五结合是专业队伍与群众性突击相结合、薅锄与追肥相结合、以氮肥为主的氮磷结合、薅锄与防治虫害相结合、适时晒田与注意灌水结合。全县六个区联社、五十四个公社、四百八十九个生产队都固定了社长、副队长，抓薅锄与三类苗；还固定了一千二百七十五个人员专门负责三类苗的薅锄、追肥、除虫、灌水等工作。据统计，一万一千四百三十八亩三类苗现已全部薅了一道，薅二道的占80％。与此同时，还发动群众早晚积绿肥，搞垫厩，烧灰肥，积人粪尿，普遍推行出工带肥的办法，共积肥一千八百多万斤，根据三看的原则，同时追肥到田。到上月底，有八千八百九十亩三类苗追施了肥料一千六百四十九万斤，一般每亩一千五百斤，多的二千斤。经过这一场突击，追过肥的八千多亩三类苗，已开始返青转绿分蘖。多脚公社二百四十七亩三类苗，现上升为二类苗的有二百零一亩，由三、四苗发到八、九苗。群众看到绿茵的苗棵，高兴的说：“人不哄庄稼，庄稼也不哄人；只要决心到，增产就牢靠。”现在，社员们正在继续鼓足干劲，努力使三类苗绝迹，争取更大丰收。（附图片）
