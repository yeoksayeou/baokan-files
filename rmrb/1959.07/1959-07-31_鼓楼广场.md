Drum Tower Square
Zhao Ruihong
The red Drum Tower stands tall before Five Flower Mountain, now revealing an unprecedented magnificence – if you gaze from the stone railings of the Drum Tower, the new square and gardens are before your eyes. This has become the largest center in Nanjing, with verdant mountains and forests as the backdrop to modern architecture; the plane trees on the broad avenues stretch green to the horizon, and red streetcars flow day and night.

　　 Zijin Mountain props up a verdant screen, and the lanterns on the square shine like a starry sky; a newly built avenue leads directly to the riverside, to welcome the rainbow that will fly over the great river. The scenery here surpasses many famous cities in the world; Paris has no mountain scenery, and London lacks its tranquility… Such a wide and long tree-lined road is rare! International friends say it is truly like a painted scene.

　　 Nanjing’s appearance changes daily over the past decade, and Drum Tower Square is just the largest red flower; from the reconstruction of a city, one can see the leadership of the Party! Everyone thanks the Party, wanting to say thousands and ten thousands of words!

    鼓楼广场
    赵瑞蕻五华山前红色的鼓楼高高竖起，如今现出从未有过的壮丽——你如在鼓楼上石栏边眺望，新的广场和花园就在你眼底。这里已成了南京最大的中心，青山茂林是现代化建筑的背景；大路上的梧桐直绿到天边红色的街车日夜川流不停。紫金山撑起翠绿的屏风，广场上华灯闪耀，犹如星空；一条新修的大道直通到江边，去迎接那将飞过大江的彩虹。这一带风光胜过世界上许多名城，巴黎没有山色，伦敦没有它的幽静……这么宽长的林荫道实在少见！国际朋友说这里真像一幅画景。十年来南京的面貌日日在变化，鼓楼广场只是一朵最大的红花；从一个城市的改建看党的领导！人人感谢党，要说千句话，万句话！
