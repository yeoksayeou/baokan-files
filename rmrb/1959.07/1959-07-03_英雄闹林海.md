    Heroes Stir Up the Forest Sea
    By Our Correspondent Bai Hao
    Oh, the Greater Khingan Mountains, so wide and high,
    White clouds fly past halfway up the sky,
    The forest vast, like an ocean so grand,
    Construction timber, truly abundant at hand.

              ×　×　×
    The east wind blows, infinitely good,
    Labor enthusiasm soars above the wood,
    Developing the motherland's new forest zone,
    Men and women, each a hero, have grown.
            ——Greater Khingan Mountains Folk Song

    Long Dragons Stir Up Giant Waves
    If you are flying over the Greater Khingan Mountains now, looking out as far as you can see, the mountains covered with larches, birches, and other trees, overlapping endlessly, truly seem like sailing on a green, surging ocean.
    If you climb to the top of a mountain, you will see trucks loaded with timber crawling out of the great forest along the roads, each truck dragging a long tail, like long dragons emerging from the sea.
    How were these "long dragons" born and how did they multiply? Last summer, the tide of national technological innovation impacted everyone's heart. Yang Zhenqi, a young Communist Party member and truck driver at the Xiniqi Forestry Bureau, was stirred: "Others can create inventions that increase production several times over. How can we drivers respond to the Party's call and innovate to increase transport capacity several times over?" He thought about it day and night, and finally came up with the idea: Although the truck's own carrying capacity cannot be increased too much, its towing potential is great. If we attach several trailers, like a train transporting timber, wouldn't that increase the transport volume? Jiang Zhikun, the secretary of the Party General Branch, learned of his idea and encouraged him to experiment. He first attached two specially made four-axle, sixteen-wheel heavy-duty trailers and safely hauled back sixty-three cubic meters of timber, nearly doubling the limited amount. This greatly increased his confidence. During the experiment, he examined the engine's operating conditions and felt there was still potential to be tapped. So, he put up a big-character poster, preparing to add more trailers and break the one-hundred-cubic-meter mark for a single timber transport. This big-character poster shook the young men of the truck team. Some made sarcastic remarks and didn't believe it at all. Some advocated trying it, but in the end, the Party supported him. With the support of the Party branch, Yang Zhenqi added another heavy-duty trailer and safely transported back one hundred and five cubic meters of timber. The news of the victory caused a sensation throughout the forest sea. Crowds flocked to see the "long dragon," girls ran to present flowers, and yangko dance teams came to congratulate him. This fact also broke through people's conservative thinking, and many drivers were eager to catch up with and surpass Yang Zhenqi.
    Subsequently, the Party Committee of the Greater Khingan Mountains Forestry Administration of Inner Mongolia and the Ministry of Forestry of the Central Government held two on-site meetings to promote the train-style timber transport method. From then on, the timber transport trucks in the Greater Khingan Mountains all became "long dragons" with tails, and the timber transport volume suddenly increased several times over.
    The great leap forward in transportation work posed new problems for the felling and timber collection processes: the "long dragons" needed to swallow large amounts of timber. How could the felling and timber collection processes fill the "long dragon's" appetite? As a result, the felling and timber collection workers also innovated technology and created new tools, and production leaped again and again. In this way, the "long dragon" stirred up a huge wave of comprehensive great leap forward in the forest sea, promoting the entire forest area to exceed its 1958 timber production plan by 60%.
    Vanguard Troops Battle the Virgin Forest
    Developing the virgin forest means the activities of the vanguard troops are the most arduous. In the spring, when the "North Pole" of the motherland is still bitterly cold, the surveying teams carry their instruments and tools, treading on the snow and entering the desolate Mi Mountains. After the icy cold passes, days of continuous rain come again. Wild animals appear, and swarms of mosquitoes and gadflies threaten people's safety and health. However, these difficulties are insignificant in the eyes of the vanguard troops. If they find the footprints of fierce beasts like bears, they avoid them; if they encounter small wild animals, they hunt them. The great forest is like a green palace. How much wealth can it provide for the motherland! The vanguard troops love the motherland's great forests. They overcame all kinds of difficulties. Last year, more than 600 surveying and design workers completed the surveying and design tasks for sixteen new felling enterprises, exceeding the plan by more than four times. And this year, in less than half a year, the amount of surveying work they completed has increased by more than two times compared to the same period last year.
    The exploration team is the vanguard troop, but you may not have imagined that there are vanguard troops among vanguard troops. Let's talk about Wu Jun of the Fifth Surveying Team of the Design Company of the Greater Khingan Mountains Forestry Administration! In the surveying team, he always walks at the forefront, first felling trees to clear obstacles for the surveying work. He is an old model lumberjack, familiar with the great forest as if it were his home. When walking in places where the snow is knee-deep or even waist-deep, he always steps out a foothold first to guide the team members forward. If he discovers a fierce beast, he will help the team members cleverly avoid it. Whenever they arrive at a place, he finishes felling the big trees, covered in sweat, and then helps the team members put up tents, or helps the cooks chop firewood and boil water.
    Once, they encountered heavy rain in front of the Tuo River, and the river water rose sharply. Everyone was at a loss, but Wu Jun led the young men to build a wooden horse bridge in a place where the river was narrower. The river was deep and the water was rapid, so it was not easy to install the wooden horse bridge. Wu Jun jumped down without hesitation to release the wooden horse. His legs were numb from being soaked in the cold water, and the rapid current made him unable to stand firmly. A big wave hit him into the water and he disappeared. However, the strong will to overcome the flood supported him, and he always stood at the forefront of the struggle, building the bridge. When he came ashore, his whole body was bloodless. However, he always felt that it was the most pleasant thing for a Communist Party member to endure hardship first.
    Female Hero
    Tens of thousands of women in the entire forest area have become an indispensable force on the forestry front. They are most active, especially in the forest renewal and fire prevention movement, in planting vegetables, running small-scale forest product industries, and in service industries. Here, there is a female hero who walks at the forefront of women. She is Bai Guizhen, a Mongolian family member of a worker who has attended the "Heroes' Congress" in Beijing twice. In the first year of the first Five-Year Plan, when the forest was being developed, she came to the Turiel River Forestry Bureau's lumber yard with her husband. In the lumber yard, the thick and long timber piled higher and higher. Bai Guizhen loved these timbers so much when she saw them. She thought, "How many houses can be built with these!" She actively participated in the forest fire prevention movement to protect these timbers. Later, she was elected as the director of the Family Committee and responded more actively to the Party's call, leading women to participate in movements such as no forest fires and forest renewal.
    Last year, the Inner Mongolia Party Committee called on the entire Party and all the people to mobilize to vigorously implement the policy of combining felling and renewal. Bai Guizhen mobilized a large number of women to sign up to plant trees in the deep mountains. At that time, Bai Guizhen was suffering from swollen face disease and waist and leg pain. Going to the deep mountains to plant trees was an arduous task, but she had to take the lead no matter what. In the mountains, swarms of mosquitoes and gadflies attacked, biting out strings of small bumps on their faces. The mud ponds were so deep that they could sink up to their knees. All these unfavorable factors could not stop her from moving forward. In the summer forest, it rained continuously. Some people couldn't bear it, but Bai Guizhen happily said to everyone: "Trees love to live when planted in the rain, so we must make good use of this opportunity." She was like someone without illness, and was even more active in the rain. Her strong will and selfless spirit infected and encouraged her sisters, and finally completed the forest renewal operation task ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota.
    The heroic deeds of the heroic sons and daughters in the forest sea are endless. The people of the whole country will realize that every tree flowing from here to all parts of the country is condensed with the sweat of those heroic sons and daughters who have overcome countless difficulties!

    英雄闹林海
    本报记者　白皓兴安岭哟宽又高，白云飞过半山腰，森林广阔像海洋，建设良材真丰饶。
              ×　×　×东风吹来无限好，劳动热情冲云霄，开发祖国新林区，男女个个赛英豪。
            ——大兴安岭民歌
    长龙掀巨浪
    如果你现在乘飞机航行在大兴安岭上空，极目四望，那长满落叶松和白桦等各种树木的山峦，重重叠叠，无边无际，真如同航行在绿波汹涌的大海之上。
    假如你登上一个山岗，就会看到从大森林里顺着公路爬出的一辆辆满载木材的汽车，每辆汽车都拖着个长尾巴，就像条条长龙从大海里翻了出来。
    这“长龙”是怎样诞生和繁殖起来的呢？去年夏天，全国技术革新的浪涛冲激着每一个人的心。西尼气林业局汽车驾驶员、年轻的共产党员杨振起的心翻腾了起来：“别人能创造发明产量一跃几倍，我们司机怎样响应党的号召，也革新一下，把运量加几番呢？”他白天想，夜里想，终于想到：汽车本身虽然载重量不可加得过多，可是它的牵引潜力很大，多挂几节拖车，来个列车式运材，不就能增加运量吗？党总支书记姜志昆知道了他的心思，就鼓励他作一番试验。他先挂了两节特制的四轴十六轮重型拖车，安全地拉回了六十三立方公尺木材，比限量增加近一倍。这大大提高了他的信心。在试验中，他考察机车的运转情况，觉得还有潜力可挖，于是贴出大字报，准备再增挂拖车，突破一次运材一百立方公尺大关。这张大字报震动了汽车队的小伙子们，有的冷言冷语，根本不信。有的主张试一试，最后还是党支持了他。杨振起得到党支部的支持，又增挂了一节重型拖车，安全地运回了一百零五立方公尺木材。胜利的消息轰动了整个林海，人群蜂拥地前来看“长龙”，姑娘们跑来献花，秧歌队来贺喜。这个事实也冲破了人们的保守思想，许多驾驶员磨拳擦掌，决心要赶上杨振起，超过杨振起。
    接着，内蒙古大兴安岭林业管理局党委和中央林业部分别来召开两次现场会议，推广列车式运材法。从此，大兴安岭林海里的运材汽车都成了带尾巴的
  “长龙”，运材量猛然增加了一番到几番。
    运输工作的大跃进，给采伐和集材工序提出了新的问题：“长龙”要吞吐大量的木材，采伐和集材工序怎样才能填满“长龙”的胃口？这样一来，采伐和集材工人也纷纷革新技术、创制新的工具，产量一跃再跃。就这样，“长龙”在林海里掀起了全面大跃进的巨浪，推动了全林区超额60％完成了1958年的木材生产计划。
    尖兵鏖战原始林
    开发原始森林，要数尖兵的活动最艰苦了。春天，在这祖国的“北极”还是寒气逼人的时候，勘测队员们就背着仪器和工具踏着积雪进入那渺无人烟的弥山，冰雪严寒过去了，阴雨连绵的日子又来了，野兽出没，蚊虻成群，威胁着人们的安全和健康。但是，这些困难在尖兵们的眼里都微不足道。他们发现了大熊之类的猛兽足迹，就躲开它，遇到了小野兽就猎获它。大森林像一座绿色的宫殿，这里可以为祖国提供多少的财富！尖兵们热爱着祖国的大森林。他们克服了种种困难，六百多名勘测设计职工，去年他们完成了十六个新采伐企业的勘测设计任务，超过计划四倍多；而今年还不到半年时间，他们完成的勘测工作量又比去年同期增加两倍多。
    勘探队是尖兵，可是你也许想不到尖兵之中还有尖兵吧。这里且说一说大兴安岭林业管理局设计公司第五勘测队的吴军吧！在勘测队里他总是走在最前面，先砍倒树木，给测量工作清除障碍。他是个老模范伐木工，大森林像他的家一样熟悉。走到积雪没膝甚至齐腰深的地方，他总是先踏出脚窝引导队员前进；发现了猛兽他会帮助队员们巧妙地躲开；每到一处，他砍完了大树满头大汗，又来帮助队员们搭帐篷，或者帮助炊事员劈材烧水。
    有一次在托河面前遇到了大雨，河水猛涨，大家都束手无策，吴军却在一处河水较窄的地方，领着小伙子们作起了木马桥。河深水急，安上木马桥可不容易，吴军毫不犹豫地跳下去放木马。冷水泡得两腿麻木了，急流冲得他站立不稳，一个大浪把他打在水里不见了。但是，战胜大水的坚强意志支撑着他，始终站在斗争最前列，架好了桥。当他上岸来的时候，混身已经没有血色了。但是，他总觉得吃苦在前是共产党员最愉快的事情。
    女英雄
    全林区几万妇女已经成为林业战线上的一支不可缺少的力量。特别是在森林更新和护林防火运动中，在种植蔬菜、大办小型林产工业和服务性行业的活动中，她们最为活跃。在这里有一位走在妇女前列的女英雄，她是曾经两次进北京参加“群英会”的职工家属、蒙古族白桂珍。在第一个五年计划头一年开发森林的时候，她随丈夫来到新建设的图里河林业局贮木场。在贮木场上，那又粗又长的木材越堆越高，白桂珍看到这些木材喜爱得不得了，她想“这能盖多少房子啊！”她积极地参加了护林防火运动，来保护这些木材。后来她当选为家属委员会的主任，更积极地响应党的号召，带动妇女们参加无森林火灾和森林更新等运动。
    去年，内蒙古党委号召全党全民动员大力贯彻执行采伐和更新并举的方针。白桂珍发动了大批妇女报名去深山造林。那时白桂珍正闹着肿脸病和腰腿痛病。到深山去造林是个艰苦的工作，但是她无论如何也要带头去干。在山上，蚊虻成批地来袭击，脸上叮出成串的小包，那泥塘一陷就是没膝，所有这些不利因素，丝毫不能阻止她前进。夏天的森林里，雨水不断，有的人支持不住，白桂珍却高兴地向大家说：“雨天栽树爱活，要好好利用这机会。”她像个没有病的人，在雨里反而更活跃了。她坚强的意志和忘我的精神感染着、鼓舞着姐妹们，终于提前和超额完成了森林更新作业任务。
    林海里的英雄儿女们的英雄事迹是说不完的。全国的人民都会意识到：从这里流向全国各地的每一棵木材里，都凝结着那些战胜了无数困难的英雄儿女们的汗水！
