　　The Weaver Girl in heaven can be considered a "skillful maiden," she weaves incomparably splendid brocade. In the past, every Qixi Festival, people would "beg for skills" from the Weaver Girl. Today, there are more and more skillful maidens in the human world. For example, the moving deeds of the skillful maiden group in the 25th workshop of the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory, as reported in the newspaper, created a broaching machine, which increased efficiency by 1,200 times; a "thousand-minute" competition completed the entire month's task in sixteen days. The skillful maidens in the human world are developing more comprehensively. "Nimble fingers and an ingenious mind" is no longer a unique trait of some maidens; it is a reflection of the talent and wisdom of the people who have liberated their minds and broken superstitions. This quality of "skill" is becoming more and more universal.

　　Where does skill come from? As the saying goes, "practice makes perfect," which shows that "skill" is gradually formed in the process of practice. Familiarity with the laws of things will lead to skillful deeds.

　　"Skill" and "knack" are similar in form and sound. A knack is the crux of a matter, the key to the contradiction. "Skill" is inherent in "knack"; to be skillful, one must grasp the knack. Finding the knack and grasping the key require scientific analysis. Skill is based on using one's brain more in practice. Only those who are willing to observe carefully and analyze attentively can be handy, resourceful, and achieve twice the result with half the effort.

　　A person should have both rough and fine qualities, complementing and supplementing each other. Being brave and knowledgeable, proficient in both literary and military skills, using both hands and brain, this is the style of the new person. Only those who are bold and meticulous, warm-hearted and cool-headed, dare to think and dare to do: when thinking, they can see the tip of an autumn hair (and of course, see a cartload of firewood); when doing, they are unswerving, swift and decisive, implementing step by step, hitting the mark with every shot. Possessing both an iron will and a beautiful mind. This is a truly pragmatic person, and this is a truly skillful person.

    巧和窍
    夏兆亿
    天上的织女算得上一位“巧姑娘”，她工织绚烂无比的云锦。从前，每当七夕，人们要向织女“乞巧”。今天，人间的巧姑娘是愈来愈多了。例如报上登过的重庆建设机床厂二十五车间巧姑娘小组的动人事迹，创造一个轧梢机，就提高了工效一千二百倍；一个“千分钟”竞赛，十六天就完成了全月任务。人间的巧姑娘更加全面发展。“心灵手巧”已经远远不是一些姑娘们所独具的特质，这是解放了思想，打破了迷信的人民群众的天才与智慧的反映，“巧”的这种品质，愈来愈普遍化了。
    巧是从何而来的呢？俗语说“熟能生巧”，可见“巧”是在实践过程中逐渐形成的。熟谙事物规律，就会作出巧事。
    “巧”和“窍”形似音近。窍是事物的窍穴，矛盾的关键。“巧”寓于“窍”，要巧就非抓住窍不可；找窍门、抓关键又非作科学分析不可。巧是以在实践中对事物多动脑筋为前提的。只有肯留心观察、用心分析的有心人，才能得心应手，左右逢源，事半功倍。
    一个人应该有粗有细，互为调剂、补充。有胆有识，能文能武，手脑并用，这是新人的风格。也只有这种胆大心细，心热头冷的人才敢想敢干：想起来，能明察秋毫之末（当然更能见舆薪）；干起来，不折不扣，雷厉风行，步步落实，箭不虚发。既有钢铁意志，又有锦绣心胸。这才是真正实干的人，这也才是真正巧干的人。
