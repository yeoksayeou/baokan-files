    Semiconductor Racing Timer
    The Shanghai Mingxin Hardware Sports Equipment Factory has recently trial-produced a semiconductor racing timer that can automatically and accurately record the results of track and field athletes.
    This timer consists of a small light guide tube and a controller, with an additional light, placed at both ends of the finish line on the track. The light shines from the lamp onto the light guide tube, replacing the ribbon of the finish line used in the past. When the starting gun fires, the timer on the controller starts immediately. When the athlete reaches the finish line and touches the light from the lamp, the timer automatically stops. The referee only needs to sit in front of the controller and record the results.
    Using a semiconductor timer can eliminate the errors of human judgment with the naked eye, which is especially important for judging short-distance race results.
    Currently, this factory can only record the results of the first athlete to reach the finish line. They are working on further research and modifications to enable it to record the results of every athlete who reaches the finish line.
      Clever Combined Scorer
    In a tense sports match, the scoreboard is often managed by one or several people. For matches like table tennis and weightlifting, two or three people are needed to manage it. Now, the electric combined scorer trial-produced by the Shanghai Mingxin Hardware Sports Equipment Factory only requires one person to press a button to show not only the scores of both sides in the match, but also the number of rounds and matches being played. It can be used for ball games such as football, basketball, volleyball, table tennis, and weightlifting.

    体育运动器材中的新产品
    半导体赛跑计时器
    上海明新五金运动器具厂最近试制出了一具半导体赛跑计时器，它可以自动而精确地记录径赛运动员的成绩。
    这具计时器由一个很小的光导管和控制器组成，另外附设一架照明灯，分别放在跑道终点线的两端。照明灯对着光导管射出光线，代替了过去赛跑时终点线的彩带。当发令枪一响，控制器上的计时表立刻走动。运动员到达终点触及照明灯的光线，计时表就自动停止。裁判员只要坐在控制器前记下成绩就行了。
    使用半导体计时器能消除人们用肉眼判断时的误差，它对判断短距离赛跑成绩尤其重要。
    目前，这家工厂还只能记录跳到终点的第一名运动员的成绩，他们正在作进一步的研究和修改，使它可以记录跑到终点的每一个运动员的成绩。
      巧妙的联合计分器
    一场紧张的体育比赛，记分牌往往都要一个人或几个人来管理。像乒乓球、举重比赛，要两三个人管理。现在，上海明新五金运动器具厂试制出的电动联合计分器，只要一个人一按电钮，不仅可以表现出场内比赛双方的得分情况，而且还能表现出比赛进行到第几局、第几场等数字。足、篮、排、乒乓等球类和举重比赛，都可以用它。
