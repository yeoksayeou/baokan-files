Xinhua News Agency, Harbin. The Jixi, Shuangyashan, and Hegang coal mines in Heilongjiang Province are rushing to transport the stored coal from small coal pits to meet the needs of urban and rural residents.

Since 1958, the Jixi, Shuangyashan, and Hegang coal mines have developed many small coal pits. However, due to transportation limitations, most of the raw coal mined from these small coal pits has not been transported out. To quickly solve this problem, the municipal committees of the Chinese Communist Party in Jixi, Shuangyashan, and Hegang, along with the three mining bureaus, recently mobilized a large number of people to form professional transportation teams to repair roads while rushing to transport the coal. In the past ten days, they have transported over 100,000 tons of stored coal from small coal pits, supplying urban and rural residents.

    黑龙江三大煤矿突击抢运小窑煤
    据新华社哈尔滨讯　黑龙江省鸡西、双鸭山、鹤岗三大煤矿突击抢运小煤窑的贮煤，供应城乡人民用煤的需要。
    鸡西、双鸭山、鹤岗三个煤矿，从1958年以来都开发了很多小煤窑。但由于运输条件的限制，这些小煤窑采出的原煤绝大多数没有运出。为了迅速解决这个问题，鸡西、双鸭山、鹤岗三市的中共市委和三个矿务局，最近动员了大批人力组成专业运输大队，一边抢修道路，一边突击运输。十多天来已经运出小煤窑贮煤十万多吨，供应城乡人民。
