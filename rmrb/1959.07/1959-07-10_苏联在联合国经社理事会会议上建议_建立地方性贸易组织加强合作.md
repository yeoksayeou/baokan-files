Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 8th. TASS reports: The United Nations Economic and Social Council's twenty-eighth session began discussing the world economic situation on the 6th. The head of the Soviet delegation, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Filyubin, delivered a lengthy speech at the meeting, suggesting the establishment of four regional trade organizations in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America to develop trade, economic cooperation, and international division of labor within these regions.

Filyubin said that the United Nations could act as an intermediary between the seventeen-nation "Organization for European Economic Cooperation" in Western Europe and the "Council for Mutual Economic Assistance" of Eastern European socialist countries, helping them and other economic organizations establish contacts in order to develop a single world market.

The Soviet delegation put forward this proposal in consideration of the conclusions made by the United Nations Secretariat in its outline of the world economic situation in 1958. This conclusion stated that due to the crisis of overproduction, capitalist countries are in a period of economic recession. The economic recession that began in the United States has spread to other capitalist countries. The total industrial output of the entire capitalist world in 1958 decreased by 2.5% compared to 1957, falling back to the level of 1956. At the same time, the materials cited in the outline show that the economies of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries are continuously developing; and that developing trade with socialist countries has had a positive impact on the economies of many countries—Burma, India, Indonesia, the United Arab Republic, and others.

Filyubin suggested that the UN Secretary-General be entrusted with drafting a five- to seven-year plan for exchanging scientific and technological experience before the next session of the Council.

In his speech, UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, when talking about the economies of capitalist countries, said that it is still impossible to eliminate the possibility of an economic crisis that is much more severe than any crisis since the war.

### 苏联在联合国经社理事会会议上建议  建立地方性贸易组织加强合作

    苏联在联合国经社理事会会议上建议
    建立地方性贸易组织加强合作
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：联合国经济及社会理事会第二十八次会议6日开始讨论世界经济状况。苏联代表团团长、苏联外交部副部长费留宾在会上作了长篇发言，建议建立欧洲、亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲四个地方性的贸易组织，以便发展贸易、经济合作和这些地区内的国际分工。
    费留宾说，联合国可以作西欧十七国“欧洲经济合作局”和东欧社会主义国家的“经济互助委员会”的中间人，帮助它们以及其他经济组织建立接触，以发展单一的世界市场。
    苏联代表团提出这个建议，是由于考虑到联合国秘书处在它起草的1958年世界经济状况概述中所作的结论。这个结论说：由于生产过剩的危机，资本主义国家正处在经济衰退时期。在美国开始的经济衰退扩展到了其他资本主义国家。整个资本主义国家的工业总产量在1958年比1957年缩减了2.5％，退到1956年的水平。同时，概述中所举的材料表明，苏联、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家的经济不断发展；而同社会主义国家发展贸易对许多国家——缅甸、印度、印度尼西亚、阿拉伯联合共和国和其他国家——的经济产生了良好的影响。
    费留宾建议委托联合国秘书长在理事会的下次会议以前拟出交流科学技术经验的五年—七年计划。
    联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德在发言中谈到资本主义国家的经济时说，现在还不可能消除出现这样一种经济危机的可能性，这种经济危机比战后的任何一次危机要严重得多。
