Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 1st July: According to TASS, First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Kozlov, and his entourage arrived in Washington on June 30th by plane from Philadelphia. U.S. Vice President Nixon and other officials, as well as personnel from the Soviet Embassy, welcomed Kozlov at the airport. Kozlov will meet with U.S. President Eisenhower and other officials in Washington.

Nixon said in his welcoming address: "We believe that these meetings will be beneficial in exploring and clarifying certain issues concerning Soviet-American relations."

In his reply, Kozlov expressed the hope that meetings and conversations with American leaders would provide an opportunity for better mutual understanding and would help eliminate the abnormal relations that have formed in recent years. Kozlov said that our view is that we should boldly and resolutely overcome the unnecessary barriers that have formed in the post-war years and return to a policy of friendly coexistence, a friendly relationship that developed very well during the Second World War. We believe that all conditions are now in place to do so.

Kozlov concluded by expressing his firm belief that relations between the Soviet Union and the United States can and should be developed in a friendly manner for the well-being of the people of both countries and the people of all countries.

On the morning of June 30, Kozlov and his entourage visited the "Standard Toy" company in New York. While passing through the workshop with company manager Rosenstein, Kozlov occasionally stopped to shake hands with the workers and was very interested in the nature of their work, family situation, and working conditions. At the workers' request, Kozlov took photos with them as a souvenir.

When bidding farewell to the company's managers, staff, and workers, Kozlov thanked them for their warm hospitality. He also said, "I hope that all tanks, military aircraft, and cannons in the world will only be produced in toy factories." Everyone present responded with enthusiastic applause to these words from Kozlov.

After this, Kozlov also visited the New York Shipbuilding Corporation shipyard in New Jersey and toured the nuclear-powered merchant ship "Savannah" which was under construction.

Afterwards, Kozlov and his entourage travelled by car to Philadelphia Airport, from where they flew to Washington.
