Xinhua News Agency, New York, 2nd dispatch: According to TASS reports from New York, American newspapers have published numerous articles and photos in prominent positions about the Soviet Scientific, Technical and Cultural Achievements Exhibition. Newspapers unanimously believe that the exhibition has achieved amazing success and will have a huge impact on ordinary visitors.

    Ferguson, a reporter for the "Baltimore Sun," wrote that the exhibition attracted a large number of Americans on the first day, with a constant stream of visitors, causing a sensation. According to "The New York Times," approximately forty to fifty thousand people visited the exhibition that day. "New York Herald Tribune" wrote that all three floors of the exhibition were crowded with people, and the samples of artificial satellites and aircraft, models of agricultural machines, atomic icebreakers, automobiles, and fashions attracted the most attention from the audience.

    Marceau wrote in the "New York American" that people would naturally think of using the words "grand scale" to describe this exhibition. The Soviet exhibition is not only grand in scale, but also all-encompassing, simply dazzling. Boston wrote in the "New York Post": The Soviet Scientific, Technical and Cultural Achievements Exhibition made a deep impression on people in all three of these areas of the Soviet Union.

      "Christian Science Monitor" reporter Revorkon wrote: The entire exhibition is a proud declaration of a country, showing that this country can produce high-quality, generous, and sophisticated products. It shows that in the Soviet Union, education is free, and the government fully supports education. Teachers enjoy high honor and respect. The government is very concerned about the arts. The variety of consumer goods on display here left a deep impression on Americans.

      "Business Daily" wrote that the exhibits in heavy industry were impressive, indicating that the Soviet Union has widely adopted automation in metallurgy, and that in 1959-1965, the Soviet Union will occupy the leading position in the world in iron ore mining.

    Newspapers also published comments from some viewers. Holm from Texas, after carefully observing the agricultural machinery, said, "The machines are well made, and they may be stronger than similar American machines." Lanto, a music teacher from Ohio, wrote after seeing the exhibition: "Now I understand the Russians a little better."

    美国报纸纷纷发表评论
    苏联展览会获巨大成功
    新华社2日讯　据塔斯社纽约消息：美国报纸纷纷以显著地位刊登有关苏联科学、技术和文化成就展览会的大量文章和照片。报纸一致认为，展览会取得了惊人的成就，它对普通参观者将有巨大的影响。
    “巴尔的摩太阳报”记者福格逊写道，展览会在第一天就吸引了大量的美国人，参观者川流不息，引起了轰动。据“纽约时报”报道，这天参观展览的大约有四、五万人。“纽约先驱论坛报”写道，展览会的三层楼全都有很多人，特别是人造卫星和飞机的样品、农业机器的模型、原子破冰船、汽车和时装最吸引观众的注意。
    马索在“纽约美国人日报”上写道，人们很自然地会想到用“规模宏大”这几个字来形容这个展览会。苏联展览会不但规模宏大，而且包罗万象，简直使人看得眼花缭乱。波斯顿在“纽约邮报”上写道：苏联科学、技术和文化成就展览会使人对苏联所有这三个方面都产生了很深的印象。
      “基督教科学箴言报”记者雷佛康写道：整个展览会是一个国家的骄傲声明，它表明这个国家能生产质量优良、大方和精细的产品。它说明，在苏联受教育是免费的，而且政府全力支持着教育事业。教师享有崇高的荣誉和尊敬。政府十分关心艺术事业。这里所展出的各种各样的消费品，给美国人留下了深刻的印象。
      “商务日报”写道，重工业方面的展品给人留下了深刻的印象，它说明，苏联在冶金方面已经广泛地采用了自动化，同时，在1959—1965年内，苏联在铁的开采方面，将要占世界的首要地位。
    报纸还发表了一些观众的评论。从得克萨斯州来的霍姆在仔细地观察了农业机器后说，“机器造得很好，它们可能比同样的美国机器更坚固些。”从俄亥俄州来的音乐教师兰托看完展览后写道：“现在我稍稍有点了解俄国人了。”
