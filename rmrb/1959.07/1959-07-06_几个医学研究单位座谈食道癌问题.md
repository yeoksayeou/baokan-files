    Symposium on Esophageal Cancer by Several Medical Research Units

    Recently, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences held a specialized symposium on esophageal cancer and lung cancer. The meeting discussed the incidence, etiology, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment research of esophageal cancer.

    Surveys conducted by some of the participating units, covering over 1.5 million people in different types of regions, indicated that approximately 3.3 out of 10,000 people suffer from esophageal cancer. Discussions suggested that the incidence rate is relatively high in North China, particularly in mountainous areas, followed by rural areas, with the lowest incidence in urban areas; the incidence rate is higher among men than women. Regarding the causes of the disease, opinions at the meeting suggested that living standards and dietary habits may have a certain relationship with the incidence rate, but no definitive conclusions could be drawn. Alcohol consumption is not necessarily a significant factor in the disease's development. The meeting affirmed that traditional Chinese medicine has an inhibitory effect on cancer growth.

    几个医学研究单位座谈食道癌问题
    最近在中国医学科学院开了一个关于食道癌、肺癌的专题座谈会。在会上讨论了食道癌的发病情况、病因、诊断和防治研究工作。
    与会的一些单位，曾经在不同类型的地区，进行了一百五十多万人口的普查表明，患食道癌的约占万分之三点三。据讨论认为，华北地区发病率较高，其中又以山区为高，农村次之，城市最低；男性发病率较女性为高。关于发病原因，会上意见，认为生活水平、饮食习惯和发病率可能有一定关系，但不能就此定论；饮酒不一定是发病的重要因素。会上肯定了中医中药对癌的生长有抑制作用。
