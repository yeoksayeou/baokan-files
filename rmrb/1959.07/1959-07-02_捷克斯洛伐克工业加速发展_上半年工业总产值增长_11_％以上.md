Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 1st. Czechoslovakia's major economic sectors have all fulfilled or overfulfilled their production plans for the first half of this year. The total industrial output value increased by more than 11% compared with the same period last year, and many industrial and mining enterprises completed their production tasks ten days or one week ahead of schedule. This year, metallurgy, one of the key sectors for Czechoslovakia's national economic development, achieved excellent results in the first half of the year. A total of three million tons of steel were produced in six months, an increase of 11% over the same period last year; two million tons of steel products, an increase of 4% over the same period last year; and two million tons of pig iron, an increase of 10% over the same period last year.

As the foundation of Czechoslovakia's national economy, the machine-building industry has achieved its highest growth rate in six years. In six months, it produced 16.8% more heavy machinery and 18% more general machinery than in the first half of last year.

The chemical industry is also developing rapidly. In the first half of this year, the chemical industry increased by 11.8% compared with the same period last year. Great progress has been made in the production of chemical fertilizers, for example, the production of nitrogen fertilizer increased by 56% compared with the same period last year.

In the first half of this year, Czechoslovakia produced a total of 10.55 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, an increase of more than 11% compared with the same period last year. At present, in terms of per capita electricity generation, Czechoslovakia has surpassed the United Kingdom and is about to approach the levels of the United States and West Germany.

The rapid growth of electricity production not only provides a strong power base for industrial production but also provides a good prerequisite for rural electrification. At present, more than 96% of the country's rural areas have been electrified. The electricity industry sector is now confidently working hard to complete rural electrification next year.

The construction industry, which has always developed relatively slowly, has also made considerable progress in the first half of this year. The workload has increased by about 20% compared with the first half of last year.

    捷克斯洛伐克工业加速发展
    上半年工业总产值增长11％以上
    据新华社布拉格1日电　捷克斯洛伐克各主要经济部门都完成或超额完成了今年上半年的生产计划，工业总产值比去年同时期增长了11％以上，许多工矿企业都提前十天或一周完成了自己的生产任务。今年捷克斯洛伐克发展国民经济的重点部门之一——冶金工业在上半年取得了很好的成绩。六个月中共生产了三百万吨钢，比去年同时期增长了11％；二百万吨钢材，比去年同期增长了4％；二百万吨生铁，比去年同期增长10％。
    作为捷克斯洛伐克国民经济基础的机器制造业，今年的增长速度达到了六年来的最高峰，六个月内共生产了比去年前半年多16.8％的重型机器，多18％的一般机器。
    化学工业的发展也很迅速，今年上半年，化学工业比去年同时期增长了11.8％。化学肥料的生产获得极大进展，例如氮肥的生产比去年同期增长了56％。
    今年上半年捷克斯洛伐克共生产了一百零五点五亿度电，比去年同时期增长了11％多。目前在按人口计算的发电量方面，捷克斯洛伐克已超过英国，即将接近美国和西德的水平。
    电力生产的迅速增长除为工业生产准备了强大的动力基础外，还为农村电气化提供了良好的前提。目前全国已有96％以上的农村实现了电气化，电力工业部门现正满怀信心地为明年完成农村电气化而努力。
    一向发展较慢的建筑工业在今年上半年也有了长足进展。工作量比去年上半年提高了约20％。
