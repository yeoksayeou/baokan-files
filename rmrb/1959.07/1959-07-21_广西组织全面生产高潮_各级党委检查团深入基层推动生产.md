    Nanning, July 20 (this newspaper) - An overall production upsurge centered on grain production is gradually taking shape in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The Autonomous Region Party Committee is seizing the opportunity and convening telephone conferences, organizing powerful work teams to promote the rapid development of the production upsurge.

    On the Guidongnan Plain, millions of mu of early rice are golden, and late rice seedlings are lush and green. This area has entered the busy season of summer harvesting and summer planting. In the mountainous Baise area, while strengthening field management of mid-season rice and other crops, the vast number of Zhuang commune members have established a command headquarters to eliminate wasteland and actively expand the planting area for autumn grain. Jingxi County has put forward the battle cry of "Seizing every second of time, competing for every inch of land, fighting for every catty of fertilizer, and cherishing every grain of grain," determined to achieve the increased production plan of producing a thousand catties of grain and ten thousand catties of sweet potatoes per mu. More than 10,000 rural cadres in the county have gone deep into the fields to participate in labor and direct production. In Yulin Prefecture, where more mid-season rice is planted, farmers are doing everything possible to eliminate third-class seedlings, carrying out an over-production campaign with the spirit of "mid-season rice surpassing early rice, one crop equaling two, and late rice catching up with early rice." According to incomplete statistics as of July 11, the total labor force投入into summer harvesting and summer planting in the entire autonomous region has reached more than 3.6 million people, and the area planted and about to be planted with grain crops is approximately 4.3 million mu larger than originally planned. The amount of summer fertilizer accumulated has reached nearly 800 million dan, and various sideline productions have also seen significant development.

    Under this vivid and vigorous new situation, the Party committees of various districts, counties, and communes in the autonomous region have successively organized summer harvesting and summer planting work teams, dispatched them to the countryside to assist grassroots cadres, and promoted the rapid arrival of a comprehensive production upsurge. On July 9, the Autonomous Region Party Committee specifically convened a telephone conference, requiring all localities to seize the favorable opportunity, organize and lead this comprehensive increased production upsurge centered on grain production, and called on Party committees and cadres at all levels to conscientiously implement various production policies, do a good job in distribution, make comprehensive arrangements for production, further mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, launch a mass over-production campaign on the basis of implementing the production contracts, and at the same time, grasp the production of pigs, chickens, ducks, oilseeds, and vegetables, and strengthen the leadership of handicraft production to meet the needs of the people's lives.

    At present, various regions are enthusiastically discussing the instructions of the Autonomous Region Party Committee. When discussing and formulating over-production plans in Xing'an, Quanxian, Guanyang, Lingui and other counties in the Guilin Prefecture, the masses have said one after another: "The production targets were set by ourselves, and we will definitely be able to complete the over-production plan." Many commune members are full of confidence in realizing the specific plans of filling granaries with grain, filling pens with pigs, and having flocks of chickens and ducks, and are working hard to achieve the increased production plan.

    广西组织全面生产高潮
    各级党委检查团深入基层推动生产
    本报南宁20日电　一个以粮食生产为中心的全面生产高潮，正在广西僮族自治区逐步形成，自治区党委趁热打铁，召开电话会议，组织强大工作团，推动生产高潮迅速发展。
    在桂东南平原上数百万亩早稻一片金黄，晚稻秧苗翠绿茁壮，这里已进入夏收夏种大忙。多山的百色专区，广大僮族社员在加强中稻等作物的田间管理的同时，成立了消灭荒田荒地指挥部，积极扩大秋粮的种植面积。靖西县提出“时间分秒必争，面积寸土必争，肥料斤担必争，粮食颗颗必争”的战斗口号，决心实现亩产千斤粮、万斤薯的增产规划，全县一万多名农村干部，已经分片包干深入田间，参加劳动，指挥生产。种植中稻较多的玉林专区，农民们千方百计消灭三类禾苗，以“中稻超早稻，一造顶两造，晚稻赶早稻”的气概，开展超包产运动。到7月11日的不完全统计，全自治区各地投入夏收夏种的劳动大军已达三百六十多万人，已种植和即将种植的粮食作物，约比原计划扩大四百三十万亩，夏季积肥量已近八亿担，各项副业生产也有了显著的发展。
    在这个生动蓬勃的新形势之下，自治区各地、县、公社党委纷纷组织了夏收夏种工作团，分头下乡，协助基层干部，推动全面的生产高潮迅速到来。7月9日，自治区党委专门召开一次电话会议，要求各地抓紧有利时机，组织领导好这个以粮食生产为中心的全面增产高潮，号召各级党委、干部认真贯彻执行各项生产政策，做好分配工作，搞好生产全面安排，进一步调动群众积极性，在包产落实的基础上，掀起一个群众性的超包产运动，同时也要抓好猪、鸡、鸭、油料、蔬菜的生产，加强手工业生产的领导，以满足人民生活的需要。
    现在各地区正在热烈讨论自治区党委的指示，桂林专区的兴安、全县、灌阳、临桂等县在讨论制订超包产计划时，群众纷纷反映：包产指标是我们自己订的，超产计划我们一定能够完成。许多社员对实现谷满仓、猪满栏、鸡鸭成群的具体规划，都充满了信心，正为实现增产计划努力。
