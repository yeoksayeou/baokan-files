　　Constantly improving medical technology and efficacy is the goal that medical workers strive for. Especially since last year, all levels of medical institutions have been universally established in urban and rural areas, and a "medical network" has spread everywhere, it is even more necessary to pay attention to improving the level of medical technology.

　　Now, Liaoning and Shanghai have taken various measures, such as urban support for rural areas and reciprocal exchanges in Liaoning, and zonal contracting and large-scale assistance to small-scale entities in Shanghai, which have not only helped improve grassroots medical institutions, but also trained urban medical workers. These methods provide valuable experience for consolidating and improving the "medical network." It is hoped that all regions can adopt methods that are appropriate to the time and local conditions in continuous practice, and help grassroots medical institutions in urban and rural areas improve their level as quickly as possible, so as to be able to treat general or relatively complex diseases, so that the broad masses of the people can receive timely and convenient treatment.

    需要帮助
    不断提高医疗技术水平和疗效，是医务工作者奋斗的目标。特别是去年以来，各地城乡普遍建立了各级医疗机构，遍布了“医疗网”，更是需要注意提高医疗技术水平。
    现在，辽宁和上海都采取了各种措施，如辽宁的城市支援农村、对口交换，上海的分区包干、以大带小等办法，既帮助了基层医疗机构的提高，又锻炼了城市的医务工作者。这些办法提供了巩固和提高
  “医疗网”的宝贵经验。希望各地都能在不断的实践中，采取因时因地制宜的办法，尽可能快地帮助城乡的基层医疗机构提高水平，达到能够治疗一般的或是比较复杂的疾病，使广大人民能够得到及时而方便的治疗。
