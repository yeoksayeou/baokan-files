    Rationally Arrange Autumn Grain Planting Area
    Wannian County, after investigation and mobilizing the masses for discussion, divided the county into three categories of regions, rationally arranged the planting area and crop types, and closely integrated the planting plan with the different conditions of the local area.
    Nanchang, July 15th (This newspaper) - Wannian County, Jiangxi Province, is actively implementing the policy of planting more and harvesting more in accordance with local conditions during the current summer planting season, ensuring that as much is planted as possible, without leaving any land uncultivated, and ensuring good planting and striving for high yields.
    In accordance with this principle, after investigation and research and mobilizing the masses for discussion, the planting plans for major autumn crops have been fully implemented, and the planting area has been expanded by more than 50% compared with last year. The masses in various places have great confidence and enthusiasm in striving to plant more and harvest more.
    Wannian County is adjacent to Poyang Lake and has plains, hills and mountains. Therefore, labor, natural conditions and planting habits are different. In order to achieve more planting and more harvesting, the Wannian County Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to combine the county's planting plan with the conditions of different regions, rationally arrange the planting area and crop types, and avoid issuing tasks in a one-size-fits-all manner, which is not in line with the actual situation and may lead to losses. To this end, the county party committee adopted the method of investigation from top to bottom and mobilizing the masses for discussion from bottom to top, that is, on the one hand, the county investigated and clarified the conditions of summer planting area, labor, soil quality, water source, and fertilizer source in different regions, and on the other hand, mobilized the masses to discuss the needs and possibilities of planting more and harvesting more, and tapping potential. Finally, according to the different situations of various places and the opinions of the masses, the county was divided into three categories of regions. The first category is the plain lakeside area, with three communes. This type of area has abundant labor and fertile soil, and autumn crops can be planted as much as possible. However, most of the high fields rely entirely on human-powered water carts for drainage, and are only suitable for planting dry crops such as millet, soybeans, sesame, and sweet potatoes; another part of the low-lying land has good water conservancy and is suitable for planting double-season late rice. The second category is the hilly area, with seven communes. This type of area also has sufficient labor. Half of the fields that should be planted have relatively good water conservancy facilities. With good water storage and conservation work, double-season late rice can be planted; the other half have poor water conservancy facilities or no water conservancy facilities at all, and are prone to drought in autumn, so they are only suitable for planting various dry crops. The third category is the mountainous area, with three communes. This type of area has good water sources and abundant fertilizer sources, and is suitable for planting late rice. However, the unfavorable condition is that there are many fields and less labor. As long as some labor can be supported during rice transplanting, the late rice area can be further expanded. Some fields that are not suitable for planting late rice can also be planted with dry crops that require less labor and have high economic value.
    On the basis of investigation and mass discussion, the county party committee further required all people's communes to plan and arrange the land for planting autumn crops by different regions, plot by plot, and on the premise of first ensuring the planting of more late rice, to ensure that the plans for various crops are implemented and reasonable and feasible. In order to further expand the planting area of late rice, the Solidarity, Dahuan, and Shizhen communes in the lakeside area jointly built a river port, so that more than 20,000 mu of barren lakeside sandy land can be planted with double-season late rice. Chenying Commune in the hilly area has determined that all 5,000 mu of paddy fields that can improve drought resistance after renovating channels will be planted with double-season late rice, and plans to use the areas beside water sources and canals to plant double-season late rice. Fields with insufficient water sources are planted with dry crops such as soybeans and sesame according to local customs.
    Due to the rational arrangement of autumn crops and the implementation of plans, the masses in various places have great confidence and enthusiasm in striving to plant more and harvest more in autumn. All localities are seizing the opportunity before the summer harvest and summer planting to vigorously carry out the cultivation and management of late rice seedling fields, and have prepared sufficient seeds for planned autumn miscellaneous grains and economic crops. All large and small water conservancy projects are full of water, and some have also been renovated or excavated with canals. All communes are now prepared with labor, and when the season arrives, they will launch a 20-day blitz to ensure good harvesting and planting.

    合理安排秋粮种植面积
    万年县经过调查和发动群众讨论，把全县划分为三类地区，合理安排播种面积和作物种类，把播种计划同当地的不同条件密切接合起来。
    本报南昌15日电　江西省万年县在安排当前夏种时，因地制宜地积极贯彻多种多收的方针，做到既能多种，不荒一分田，不留一寸土；又能保证种好，争取多收。
    按照这个原则，全县各地经过调查研究和发动群众讨论，大秋作物的播种计划已全部落实，播种面积比去年扩大了50％以上。各地群众争取多种多收的信心和干劲很足。
    万年县邻近鄱阳湖，是个平原、丘陵和山区兼有的地方，因此劳力、自然条件和种植习惯各有不同。为了很好作到多种多收，中共万年县委决定把全县的播种计划同不同地区的条件结合起来，合理安排播种面积和作物的种类，避免千篇一律下达任务，不合实际情况，招致损失。为此县委采取了自上而下的调查与自下而上发动群众讨论的办法，即一方面由县调查摸清不同地区夏种的面积、劳力、土质、水源、肥源等条件，一方面发动群众讨论多种多收的需要和可能，挖掘潜力。最后按照各地不同情况和群众意见，将全县划分为三类地区。一类是平原滨湖地区，有三个公社。这类地区劳动力充足，土质肥沃，秋季作物能够尽量多种。但是，大部分高田全靠人力车水排水，只宜种植黄粟、大豆、芝麻、红薯等旱作物；另一部分低洼地水利好，宜种二季晚稻。第二类是丘陵地区，有七个公社。这类地区劳动力也还充足，应该种的田有一半水利设施较好，作好蓄水保水工作，都可以种植二季晚稻；另一半因水利设施较差，或根本没有水利设施，秋季容易受旱，只宜种各种旱作物。第三类是山区，有三个公社。这类地区水源好、肥源足、适宜种植晚稻。但不利的条件是田亩多劳力少，只要在插秧时能支援一部分劳动力，晚稻面积就可以进一步扩大。有一些不适宜于种植晚稻的田，也可以种植花工少、经济价值高的旱作物。
    在调查摸底和群众讨论的基础上，县委又进一步要求各人民公社，对种植秋季作物的土地分别不同地区逐块排队规划，在首先保证多种晚稻的前提下，切实做到各种作物计划落实，合理可行。滨湖区的团结、大黄、石镇等公社，为了进一步扩大晚稻种植面积，共同修建了一条河港，使两万多亩荒芜的湖田沙地，都能种上二季晚稻。丘陵地区的陈营公社，把经过整修渠道可以提高抗旱能力的五千多亩水田，全部确定种植二季晚稻，水源、水圳两旁也计划利用起来种二季晚稻。水源不足的田则按照当地习惯分别种植大豆、芝麻等旱作物。
    由于秋季作物安排合理，计划落实，各地群众争取秋季多种多收的信心很大，干劲很足。各地紧紧抓住夏收夏种以前的时机，大搞晚稻秧田培育管理，并为计划播种的秋杂粮和经济作物准备了充足的种子。所有大小水利工程都蓄满了水，有的还经过整修或开挖了渠道。各公社现都做好了劳力准备，季节一到，突击二十天，保证做好抢收抢种。
