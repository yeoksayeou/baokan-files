Xinhua News Agency, Athens, July 10th: According to TASS, the Greek authorities, disregarding protests and condemnations from world public opinion, began the trial of Manolis Glezos and other Greek patriots in an Athens military court on July 9th, based on the so-called "espionage" charges.

The Greek public is watching this trial with indignation and anxiety. On this day, many Athenians gathered in front of the heavily guarded military court. To prevent the general public from witnessing the trial, the reactionary authorities deliberately chose a small house as the courtroom, and under the pretext of "security," drove out the few people who had overcome the police's obstacles and entered the room.

The famous Greek jurists - former Minister of Justice Papaspirou, leader of the bourgeois Progressive Party Vassilatos, Iliou, and Stephanakis, etc. - attended the military court to defend Glezos and other patriots. Forty-nine prominent political and social activists, cultural and scientific figures, and trade union activists representing all strata of Greek people announced that they intended to be witnesses for Glezos and others in court, including eight former ministers, sixteen members of various opposition parties, as well as journalists and writers.

The well-known Italian jurist and parliamentarian Berlinguer, French lawyers Lambert and Aronaniu, representing the International Committee for the Defense of Glezos and the International Federation for Human Rights, attended the court. British jurist Moore and other jurists from France and Italy also attended.

When Glezos and other patriots were escorted into the courtroom, representatives of the Greek and world public warmly welcomed them.

After the indictment was read, the defense lawyers protested the authorities' obstruction of public attendance. Defense lawyer Stephanakis pointed out that the Greek people were very concerned about this trial, and on behalf of his colleagues, he requested that the court be moved to a more spacious building.

Other defense lawyers then spoke one after another, protesting the referral of Glezos and other patriots to a military court on fabricated charges of "espionage." Stephanakis emphasized that Law No. 375, on which the military court was based, violated the Greek constitution and undermined the foundation of the judicial system. He demanded that the trial of this case be stopped in the military court, because the military court had no right to try political cases. He said that political cases were the affair of civil courts. Other defense lawyers made the same request.

The audience clearly saw that the president of the military court was speechless and unable to refute the defense lawyers' justified speeches, so he attempted to put pressure on them, which aroused the protests of the defense lawyers. The morning trial ended here.

The court continued to sit that evening, and the court determined that it had the right to try Glezos and other patriots accused of "espionage." It insisted that Law No. 375 was in accordance with the "constitution." In this way, the military court had actually agreed to the fabricated "charges" against Glezos and others before the trial.

Now, all of Greece has stood up to defend its loyal sons. Former ministers, parliamentarians, legal scholars, writers, actors, artists, state officials, workers, and peasants are participating in the movement to defend Glezos and other patriots. People from bourgeois political parties, including the ruling National Radical Union, as well as left-wing figures, have joined this movement to defend democracy.

A group of bourgeois figures in Thessaloniki (including former Minister Kostopoulos, etc.) demanded in a letter to Prime Minister Karamanlis to abolish Law No. 375 promulgated during the fascist dictatorship.

Former Minister Makas, former Deputy Speaker Leonardos, and parliamentarian Valourdos have protested the military court's trial of Glezos.

### 希腊民族败类无权审讯民族英雄  辩护律师指斥军事法庭违法

    希腊民族败类无权审讯民族英雄
    辩护律师指斥军事法庭违法
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社雅典9日讯：希腊当局不顾世界公众的抗议和谴责，9日在雅典军事法庭根据所谓从事“间谍活动”的诬告开始审讯曼诺里斯·格列索斯和其他希腊爱国者。
    希腊公众怀着愤慨和不安的心情注视着这次审讯。这一天清早，戒备森严的军事法庭门前就聚集了许多雅典人。反动当局为了阻止广大公众目睹审讯情况，故意选了一个小房子来做法庭，并且以“安全”为借口，把少数越过了警察的拦阻进到室内的人赶出去。
    著名的希腊法学家——前司法大臣帕帕斯皮鲁、资产阶级进步党领袖瓦西拉托斯、伊利乌和斯特凡纳基斯等人出席军事法庭为格列索斯和其他爱国者辩护。代表希腊各阶层人民的四十九个著名政治活动家和社会活动家、文化和科学界人士、工会活动家宣布，他们打算在法庭上为格列索斯等人做见证人，其中有八个是前大臣，十六个是各反对党的议员，另外还有新闻工作者和作家。
    代表国际保卫格列索斯委员会和争取人权国际联合会的意大利著名法学家和议员贝林格尔、法国律师朗贝尔和阿罗纳纽都出席法庭。到庭的还有英国法学家穆尔和来自法国和意大利等国的其他法学家。
    当格列索斯和其他爱国者被押进法庭的时候。庭内的希腊和世界公众的代表热烈地欢迎他们。
    在宣读了起诉书后，辩护律师对当局阻挠公众出席旁听提出了抗议。辩护律师斯特凡纳基斯指出，希腊人民对这次审讯十分关心，他代表他的同事，要求把法庭转移到更宽敞的房子去。
    其他辩护律师接着一一发言，他们抗议捏造所谓从事“间谍活动”的罪名而把格列索斯和其他爱国者交付军事法庭。斯特凡纳基斯着重指出，组成军事法庭所依据的第三百七十五号法律违反了希腊的宪法，并且破坏了司法制度的基础。他要求停止在军事法庭审理这个案件，因为军事法庭无权审理政治案件。他说，政治案件是民事法庭的事情。其他辩护律师也提出了同样的要求。
    旁听者都清楚地看到，军事法庭庭长理屈词穷，无法反驳辩护律师的理直气壮的发言，于是企图对他们施压力，这引起了辩护律师的抗议。上午的审讯就此结束。
    当天晚上继续开庭，法庭自行断定它有权审讯格列索斯和其他被控从事“间谍活动”的爱国者。它硬说，第三百七十五号法律是合乎“宪法”规定的。这样，军事法庭实际上在审讯之前就已经同意对格列索斯等人捏造的“罪名”了。
    现在，全希腊都挺身出来保卫自己的忠实儿子。参加保卫格列索斯和其他爱国者运动的有前任大臣、议员、法律学家、作家、演员、艺术家、国家职员、工人和农民。包括执政的国民激进联盟在内的资产阶级政党人士以及左翼人士，都投入保卫民主的这一运动之中。
    萨罗尼加一批资产阶级人士（其中包括前大臣科斯托普洛斯等人）在给首相卡拉曼利斯的一封信中要求取消在法西斯专制时期颁布的第三百七十五号法律。
    前大臣马卡斯、前副议长列奥纳尔多斯、议员瓦卢尔多斯等人纷纷抗议军事法庭对格列索斯的审讯。（附图片）
