Branch Secretary Wang Hongzhang
In the Baitan Production Brigade of the Baitan People's Commune in Fugou County, Henan Province, everyone, male or female, elder or younger, calls Wang Hongzhang "Secretary Wang"—the branch secretary of this brigade. The masses say, "Secretary Wang! In a word, he understands our hearts."

It was the fourth night of the most intense wheat harvest when I arrived at Baitan Brigade. I couldn't find Wang Hongzhang anywhere. At dawn, in the gray drizzle, he appeared. He was drenched and didn't look well. The commune members who came with him said that this year's wheat was good, and the harvesting task was heavy, and Secretary Wang hadn't slept well for four days and four nights. Then, they told me the story of last night at the threshing ground: Because the weather station predicted wind and rain last night, the brigade organized a night of intensive wheat stacking. At midnight, a force five wind rose. At that time, Wang Hongzhang was standing on the wheat stack, even his shorts were soaked with sweat, and he shivered several times, but he thought: the commune members have been working all day and half the night, they are very tired, and if they are exposed to the cold and heat, they are prone to illness, but they can't rest now, what should I do? He jumped down from the wheat stack and first sent commune member Yan Xiurong back home, then hurriedly went to the supply and marketing cooperative to buy some white wine, warmed it up, and brought it to the threshing ground: "Folks! At this time, drinking a few sips of old liquor will relieve fatigue and cure all kinds of diseases, come on!" He held the wine pot and walked to everyone, asking them to take turns drinking. Finally, there were a few sips left, he put it to his mouth, but then put it down. After some pushing and shoving, he insisted that a commune member drink it. A few sips of old wine went into their stomachs, like a warm current surging through their bodies, and the commune members immediately felt that they had gained new strength, stacking wheat while chanting a quick rhyme: "Secretary Wang! That Secretary Wang, he thinks of everything, leads production brilliantly, sharing old liquor in the middle of the night…".

The cadres of the commune and brigade all say that Wang Hongzhang is good at starting from caring for people, and as a result, he found a "treasure," the key to solving problems.

In early spring, the work of strengthening wheat field management became tense. Baitan Brigade felt that there was a shortage of fertilizer. At this time, Wang Hongzhang carried a manure basket everywhere to collect manure before dawn every day. One morning, he collected manure to a small village called Banziejieheng (a small team), and saw that Wang Haiqing, who was seventy-three years old, had already filled a basket of manure. He quickly took the manure basket from the old man's back and said with concern, "Grandpa Haiqing, you are so old, getting up so early, don't exhaust yourself." The old man said, "Secretary Wang, look, I've lived for more than seventy years, and I've never seen such good wheat seedlings. Now I'm just worried that our manure can't keep up!"

Wang Hongzhang keenly discovered from this old man something precious that is usually not easy to find in commune members. So he spent several days collecting manure with the old man, helping him carry the manure basket, pour manure, and learn many methods of collecting manure. What surprised him most was that the old man could collect a large cart of manure and garbage in a day. On the third morning, he excitedly took the old man's hand and pointed to the wheat along the river and said, "Grandpa Haiqing, the government built a water conservancy project at Huayuankou, and the Yellow River water has been introduced here, look how well the wheat seedlings are drinking! The problem now is the lack of manure, the manure you collect is not manure, it is a treasure, with it, we will have grain." The old man replied with a smile, "Right! Right! That's what I'm thinking…."

Wang Haiqing was praised by the branch several times in a row, and he became even more active. One day, he stopped Wang Hongzhang on the road and stuttered that he wanted to establish a "Huang Zhong Manure Collection Team" to organize the nineteen most famous manure collection experts in the team. Wang Hongzhang praised him on the spot and immediately helped him establish the "Huang Zhong Manure Collection Team." From then on, they could collect 240 large carts of manure every month. The whole team also launched a heat wave of catching up with Wang Haiqing in collecting manure. In this way, the fertilizer problem of Baitan Brigade was solved. When the tense summer harvest and summer planting ended, they had prepared sufficient food for the autumn seedlings—tens of millions of catties of manure fertilizer.

Wang Hongzhang often said that the production team leaders are all non-detached from production, and almost all of them are the main labor force in their families. When the work tasks are tense, they have to work and lead labor, so there are more difficulties, so they should be constantly cared for and helped, and their difficulties should be considered more. Therefore, in order to avoid affecting the sleep and production of the team leaders, Wang Hongzhang never holds long meetings at night. When he finds that they have shortcomings and problems in their work, Wang Hongzhang does not simply criticize and accuse them, but works and labors with them, using his patient and meticulous work style and in-depth and specific work methods to educate them to consciously recognize their shortcomings and truly solve problems from their thinking. Therefore, all nine production team leaders in the brigade said in unison that Wang Hongzhang is a good superior.

Previously, there were two such team leaders, one named Wang Mingxian and one named Hu Maitun. Wang Mingxian was afraid of "tiring" the masses, and dragged down many production tasks, which caused dissatisfaction among most of the commune members; Hu Maitun was the opposite, he was active and enthusiastic in his work, but his style was impatient, and he criticized the masses too much. Wang Hongzhang first labored in Wang Mingxian's team for a month, leading Wang Mingxian to deeply understand the requirements of the commune members, and pushing manure and watering sweet potatoes with the commune members. The commune members were very energetic, and production caught up in a month. Wang Mingxian was educated and took the initiative to make a review. But he was afraid that after Wang Hongzhang left, the commune members would look down on him, and the work would be even more difficult. Wang Hongzhang saw through his thoughts, and on the night before he left, he said to the commune members: "Mingxian's heart is very good, he is always afraid of tiring you, but it is not good for production and for you, everyone should help him more." Wang Mingxian was moved to tears on the side.

Wang Hongzhang used the same method to help Hu Maitun. He educated Gu Si'er, whom Hu Maitun thought could not be educated, into a youth shock worker. Si'er said excitedly: "In the past, Captain Hu would criticize me as soon as he opened his mouth, and would name me at meetings; Secretary Wang is not like that, he talks to me, talks to me! He brightened my heart, and also put me into the youth shock team, saying that I would definitely be able to change for the better. Look, he believes in me so much, how can I not work hard!" Hu Maitun also changed his work style from then on.

Caring for people, if you don't care about the women who account for 70% of agricultural activities, it doesn't count. Wang Hongzhang has been paying attention to this issue for a long time. One day, female commune member Li Cuilian chopped grass with male commune members. The men continued, and the women chopped. Wang Hongzhang knew that chopping required several times more labor than continuing. But when scoring points in the evening, Li Cuilian got much less than the men. The reason is that it is not easy to master continuing grass. Wang Hongzhang felt it was unreasonable, but he didn't say anything. He immediately asked Li Cuilian, "Can you learn to continue grass?" "Yes!" Wang Hongzhang found an old farmer to teach Li Cuilian to continue grass. Li Cuilian learned it in two days, and she continued it even finer than the men, and the livestock loved to eat it. Wang Hongzhang immediately organized the most experienced old farmers in the team to teach women agricultural techniques; he also participated in the learning. As a result, five hundred women in the team learned agricultural techniques that they previously thought they could not master. In this way, the team's agricultural technical strength was greatly improved. In May, I saw a salary sheet in the accounting room of this team, and the number of female laborers above the fourth grade in the team had doubled compared with January and February.

    支部书记王鸿章
    在河南省扶沟县白潭人民公社白潭生产大队里，不论男的女的，长辈或晚辈，一律管王鸿章叫王支书——这个大队的支部书记。群众说：“王支书这个人哪！一句话，他了解咱的心”。
    正是麦收最紧张的第四个晚上，我赶到白潭大队。到处找不到王鸿章。黎明，在灰蒙蒙的细雨中，他出现了。浑身滴水，气色不大好。同来的社员说，今年麦子好，收割任务大，王支书四天四夜没好好睡觉了。接着，他们向我讲述了昨夜打麦场边的故事：因为气象站昨天预报夜间有风雨，大队组织连夜突击垛麦。午夜时分，起了五级大风。那时，王鸿章站在麦垛上，连短裤衩都被汗湿透了，一连打了几个寒噤，但他想：社员劳动一天又半夜，很累，加上冷热一激，容易闹病，但现在又不能休息，咋办呢？他从麦垛上跳下来，首先把社员阎秀荣打发回去，然后急急忙忙地去供销社买了些白酒，温了温，拿到打麦场上：“伙计！这个时候喝几口老烧酒，解乏又解百病，来！”他捧着酒罐走到每个人面前，叫他们轮流喝。最后，还剩几口，他放到嘴边，但又放下了。后来推推嚷嚷，硬要一个社员喝了。几口老酒到了肚里，像一股暖流激荡着全身，社员们顿时觉得增加了新的力量，一边垛麦，一边溜着快板：“王支书呀！那个王支书，他样样事儿想的周，领导生产呱呱叫，夜半共饮老烧酒……”。
    社队的干部都说，王鸿章善于从关心人出发，结果找到了“宝”，找到了解决问题的钥匙。
    初春，加强麦田管理工作紧张起来了。白潭大队的肥料感到不足。这时，王鸿章每天天不亮就背着粪筐到处拾粪。一天早晨，他拾粪到了一个名叫半截横的小村（一个小队），看见七十三岁的王海青已经拾满一筐粪。他连忙从老人背上接过粪筐，关心地说：“海青爷，你这样大年纪，起这么早，别累坏了身子。”老人说：“王支书，你瞅，我活了七十多，没见过这么好的麦苗，我现在就耽心咱的粪跟不上哇！”
    王鸿章敏锐地从这位老人身上，发现了通常在社员们身上不易发现的可贵东西。于是他一连几天和老人一块拾粪，帮助他背粪筐，倒粪，学了许多拾粪方法。最使他惊讶的是，老人一天能拾一大车粪和垃圾。第三天早晨，他激动地拉着老人的手，指着沿河的麦子说：“海青爷，政府在花园口修了水利工程，黄河水引进这里了，你看麦苗喝的多足！现在的问题是缺粪，你拾的这粪，不是粪，是宝，有了它，才有粮。”老人笑咪咪地回答：“对！对！我心里想的就是这个……。”
    王海青一连受到支部的几次表扬，更加积极了。一天，他在路边拦住了王鸿章，结结巴巴地说想成立“黄忠拾粪队”，把队里最有名的十九位拾粪内行组织起来，王鸿章当场赞扬了他，并立即帮助他成立了“黄忠拾粪队”。从那时起，他们每月能拾粪二百四十大车。全队还开展了赶王海青拾粪热潮。就这样，白潭大队的肥料问题解决了。当紧张的夏收夏种结束后，他们已为秋苗准备了充分的食粮——几千万斤粪肥。
    王鸿章经常说，生产小队队长都是不脱离生产的，差不多又都是家中的主要劳动力。工作任务一紧张，他们又要工作，又要带领劳动，困难就比较多，所以对他们要经常地关切和帮助，还要多体贴他们的难处。因此，王鸿章为了避免影响小队长的睡眠和生产，在晚上从来就不开长会。当发现他们工作中有了缺点和问题时，王鸿章不是一味的批评和指责，而是和他们一块劳动和工作，以自己耐心细致的工作作风和深入具体的工作方法，教育他们自觉地认识缺点，真正从思想上解决问题。因此，全大队九个生产小队长，都异口同声地说王鸿章是个好上级。
    先前，就有两个这样的小队长，一个叫王明现，一个叫胡麦屯。王明现唯恐“累”着群众，把许多生产任务拖下来，引起了多数社员不满；胡麦屯恰恰相反，工作积极热情，但作风急躁，对群众批评过多。王鸿章首先在王明现队里劳动一个月，带领王明现深入了解社员的要求，和社员一块推粪、浇红薯。社员劲头很大，一个月生产就赶上来了。王明现受了教育，主动作了检讨。但他怕王鸿章走后，社员瞧不起他，工作更不好搞。王鸿章看透了他的心思，临走的那天晚上，向社员们说：“明现的心很好，总怕累着你们，但对生产对你们都不利，大家要多帮助他。”王明现在一旁感动得落了泪。
    王鸿章用同样的办法帮助胡麦屯。他把胡麦屯认为无法教育的顾四孩，教育成青年突击手。四孩激动地说：“过去，胡队长张口就批评，会会点我的名；王支书不那样，给我谈呀，谈呀！把心谈亮了，还把我编入青年突击队，说我一定能改好。你看，他这么相信我，我咋能不干呢！”胡麦屯从此也改变了工作作风。
    关心人，如果不关心在农事活动中占70％的妇女，那也不算。王鸿章很久以来就注意这个问题。一天，女社员李翠莲和男社员一块铡草。男的续，女的铡。王鸿章知道铡比续要多付出几倍的劳力。但到晚上评分时，李翠莲比男的要少得多。理由是续草不容易掌握。王鸿章感到不合理，但没有说什么。他马上问李翠莲：“你能学续草吗？”“能！”王鸿章找了一个老农教李翠莲续草。李翠莲两天就学会了，而且续的比男的还细，牲口爱吃。王鸿章马上把全队最有生产经验的老农组织起来，教妇女学农业技术；自己也参加学习。结果，全队有五百名妇女学会了过去认为不能掌握的农事技术。这样，全队农业技术力量大大提高了。5月份，我在这个队的会计室里看到一份工资表，全队四级以上女劳动力，比1、2月份增加了一倍。
