Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, July 5th. Indonesian President and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces Sukarno issued an order this afternoon, announcing the dissolution of the Constitutional Assembly, effective today, and the restoration of the 1945 Constitution, with the Provisional Constitution ceasing to be in effect.

    The order also stated that a Provisional People's Consultative Assembly would be established in the shortest possible time, composed of representatives of the people from various regions and groups, and that a Provisional Supreme Advisory Council would be established.

    According to the 1945 Constitution, the People's Consultative Assembly is the highest organ of power. Since the general election will not be held until next year, the People's Consultative Assembly to be established will be provisional. The Indonesian Parliament will continue to exist as a legislative body.

    President Sukarno announced this decision at a solemn ceremony at the Independence Palace in Jakarta. Present were the Prime Minister, the Speakers of the Parliament and the Constitutional Assembly, the Chiefs of Staff of the three armed services, cabinet ministers, and foreign envoys to Indonesia. Many citizens gathered in front of the Independence Palace to listen to the President's announcement.

    In the order, President Sukarno mentioned the reasons for taking this decision, stating that the Constitutional Assembly had failed to make a decision on his and the government's proposal to restore the 1945 Constitution; the majority of the members of the Constitutional Assembly were unwilling to participate in the meetings of the assembly, and therefore it was no longer able to complete the task entrusted to it by the people. This situation would endanger national unity and national security, and would hinder comprehensive construction work. He also pointed out that the "Jakarta Charter" makes the 1945 Constitution more dynamic, and this charter is integrated with the constitution.

    After President Sukarno issued the order, Prime Minister Djuanda told the press this afternoon that his cabinet would return the letter of mandate to President Sukarno at nine o'clock in the morning on the 6th. Before the formation of the new cabinet, the Djuanda cabinet will temporarily remain in office as a caretaker cabinet.

    At the same time, the national flag of Indonesia will be flown for ten days to celebrate the President's announcement of the restoration of the 1945 Constitution.

    The 1945 Constitution was the first constitution of Indonesia after it declared its independence on August 17, 1945. The constitution absorbed some positive content with an anti-colonial spirit. The president's powers stipulated by this constitution are relatively large. According to the 1945 Constitution, the president possesses the highest administrative power, directly leads the government, appoints and dismisses ministers, and has the supreme power to command the navy, army, and air force. The president has certain legislative powers and can formulate government regulations for the implementation of laws and regulations, and can temporarily replace laws and regulations with government regulations when necessary. The president is elected by the People's Consultative Assembly for a term of five years.

    The People's Consultative Assembly is the highest organ of state power. The Parliament is only a legislative body. The president and the cabinet are not responsible to the Parliament. The Parliament has no right to interfere in the work of the government or to appoint or dismiss the cabinet. Therefore, the president and the government he leads will not be affected by the parliament composed of deputies from political parties and occupational strata, and its position is relatively stable.

### 苏加诺命令解散制宪议会  恢复一九四五年宪法

    苏加诺命令解散制宪议会
    恢复一九四五年宪法
    新华社雅加达5日电　印度尼西亚总统兼武装部队最高统帅苏加诺今天下午发布命令，宣告从今天起解散制宪议会，恢复1945年宪法，临时宪法停止生效。
    这项命令还说，将在尽可能短的期间内成立一个临时人民协商会议，它将由各地区的和团体的人民代表组成，并且成立一个临时最高咨询委员会。
    据1945年宪法规定，人民协商会议是最高权力机关。由于大选到明年才举行，所以将要成立的人民协商会议是临时的。印度尼西亚国会将继续作为一个立法机构而存在。
    苏加诺总统是在雅加达独立宫的一个庄严的仪式上宣布这个决定的。在场的有内阁总理、国会和制宪议会议长、三军参谋长、内阁部长和外国驻印度尼西亚的使节。许多市民群众在独立宫前面听取总统的宣告。
    苏加诺总统在命令中提到他采取这个决定的原因时说，制宪议会对他和政府所提出的恢复1945年宪法的建议没有能够作出决定；制宪议会的多数议员不愿意再参加这个议会的会议，因此它已经不再能够完成人民托付给它的任务。这种情况将会使民族团结和国家安全遭到危险，将使全面的建设工作受到阻碍。他还指出，“雅加达宪章”使1945年宪法显得更有活力，这个宪章是同这个宪法联成一体的。
    在苏加诺总统发布命令以后，朱安达总理在今天下午对报界发表谈话说，他的内阁将在6日早晨九点钟把委任状退还给苏加诺总统。在新内阁成立以前，朱安达内阁将暂时作为看守内阁而留任。
    同时，印度尼西亚全国将悬挂国旗十天，来庆祝总统宣布恢复1945年宪法。
    1945年宪法是印度尼西亚在1945年8月17日宣布独立后的第一部宪法。宪法吸收了一些具有反殖民主义精神的有积极意义的内容。这部宪法规定的总统的权限较大。根据1945年宪法，总统拥有最高行政权，直接领导政府，任免各部部长，并有执掌统帅海、陆、空三军的最高权力。总统掌握一定的立法权力，可以制订施行法令的政府条例，必要时还可以暂用政府条例代替法令。总统由人民协商会议选出，任期为五年。
    人民协商会议是国家最高权力机关。国会只是立法机构，总统和内阁不向国会负责，国会无权干涉政府工作和任免内阁，因此总统及其领导的政府将不受由党派和职业阶层代表的议员组成的国会的影响，其地位比较稳定。
