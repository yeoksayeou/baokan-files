Xinhua News Agency, Havana, July 13th. Raul Castro, Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces, received the Chinese News Delegation on the afternoon of July 13th. He entrusted the delegation to present a bronze tank model to Marshal Zhu De as a souvenir. This model was seized as a trophy from Taviniilla, the former Chief of Staff of the dictatorial army.

After warmly welcoming the visit of the Chinese delegation, the Commander-in-Chief asked the delegation to convey his gratitude to the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army for their sympathy and support for the Cuban revolution. He also said that "Mao Zedong is one of the most respected figures among Latin American youth."

He told the Chinese representatives that Cuba and China have many things in common. China had Chiang Kai-shek, and Cuba had Batista. The enemies of the two peoples were supported by the same international reactionaries.

    古巴武装部队总司令接见我新闻代表团
    向朱德元帅赠纪念品
    新华社哈瓦那13日电　古巴革命武装部队总司令劳尔·卡斯特罗13日下午接见中国新闻工作者代表团时，委托代表团向朱德元帅赠送一具铜制的坦克模型作为纪念品。这具模型是从前独裁军队参谋长塔维尼利亚那里缴获来的战利品。
    这位总司令在热烈地欢迎中国代表团的来访后，要求代表团转达他对中国人民和中国人民解放军给予古巴革命以同情和支持的谢意。他又说，“毛泽东是拉丁美洲青年最崇敬的人物之一”。
    他对中国代表们说，古巴和中国有许多共同点，中国出了个蒋介石，古巴出了个巴蒂斯塔，两国人民的敌人都得到同一个国际反动派的支持。
