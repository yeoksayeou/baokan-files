This newspaper reports from Nanchang on the 17th: Party committees at all levels in Yushan County, Jiangxi Province, have strengthened their leadership over pig production, promptly and specifically resolving problems in pig raising, resulting in a soaring increase in the county's pig population. The Jiangxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and the Department of Commerce recently jointly held a provincial on-site meeting on pig production in Yushan County to promote the county's advanced experience in developing pig production to other parts of the province.

Pig production has always been one of the main sources of income for farmers in Yushan County, who call it the "family treasure bowl." Last year, the county's income from pig raising accounted for 42% of the total agricultural income, and live pigs were sold to eighteen provinces and cities across the country. This year, thanks to the county and commune party committees' continued focus on pig production and the conscientious implementation of many effective measures, pig production has achieved even greater success. Currently, the county has 179,000 pigs, a twofold increase compared to the beginning of the year, with an average of three pigs per household.

"Of all the thousands of principles, the Party's leadership is the most important." Party committees at all levels in Yushan County have strengthened their leadership over pig production from the very beginning of this year. Party organizations at all levels, from the county to the production teams, have established livestock production headquarters, with a secretary specifically responsible for the work. Usually, the Party committees, like in their approach to agricultural production, regularly study, arrange, and inspect the work of pig production, promptly solving problems. At the same time, Party committees at all levels have established "pig-raising experimental plots" to explore production experience, set examples, and guide and drive the overall development. At the beginning of this year, the Yushan County Party Committee successively held two on-site meetings on pig production in the "pig-raising experimental plots" - Qunli and Gucheng Communes - to promptly promote the experience of emphasizing both public and private pig raising, thus finding a way for the development of pig production throughout the county. Under the unified leadership of the communes, communes, brigades, teams, and commune member households have all vigorously developed pig raising. The method of raising pigs is that communes, brigades, and teams at all levels have established small-scale pig farms, each raising 30 to 100 pigs; commune member households use old houses to rebuild or build new pigsties to raise pigs. After the communes throughout the county promoted this experience, they fully mobilized the enthusiasm for pig raising within the communes and tapped the potential for pig raising. Now, the county's 22 communes have established 22 pig farms, raising more than 3,900 pigs; the 258 production brigades have established 270 pig farms, raising more than 32,000 pigs; the 1,267 production teams have established 1,826 pig farms, raising more than 80,000 pigs; and commune member households raise more than 60,000 pigs, with pig-raising households accounting for 91% of the total number of farm households.

With the great development of pig production, the demand for breeding stock and feed has rapidly increased. To this end, Party committees at all levels have first, according to the principle of "raising pigs with pigs, self-breeding and self-raising," adopted a series of measures to solve the problem of breeding stock. These measures are: first, all of the county's original 32,000 old and new sows have stopped being castrated, and leadership has been given to ensure good breeding of the sows, achieving "four no's" (no missing estrus, no unproductive mating, no empty stomach, no miscarriage) and "two all's" (safe farrowing of sows, full survival of piglets). Second, increase the raising of new sows and boars. Third, establish a responsibility system for raising sows among the breeders to ensure the growth of the sows; at the same time, vigorously promote double mating and artificial insemination of livestock in order to achieve full mating, full accuracy, full birth, full survival, and full strength. Thanks to the above measures, the county's sows have now developed to 50,000 heads, and the more than 90,000 pigs added this year are all piglets bred within the county. Secondly, Party committees at all levels, according to the principle of "green fodder as the main component, supplemented by appropriate concentrated feed," have promptly solved the feed problem. The specific methods are: first, without affecting grain production, organize commune members to open up feed bases with pig farms as units and sow green feed crops; second, there are 120 kinds of wild vegetables and weeds in the county that can be used as feed, and breeders are mobilized to vigorously use wild vegetables and weeds to ferment green feed; third, organize professional teams to cultivate water hyacinth; fourth, process corn cobs, rice husks, peanut shells, rape stems, etc., for feed. At present, the feed crops planted by various collective units and commune members have reached more than 14,000 mu, plus the picking of wild vegetables, weeds and water hyacinth, etc., which can meet the needs of pig raising.

While developing collective pig raising, Party committees at all levels actively help commune members solve the difficulties in pig raising, so the production of pigs in commune member households has developed rapidly. If commune members do not have breeding pigs, the commune or production team will supply publicly raised piglets weighing less than 30 jin to the commune members for raising; if commune members cannot temporarily afford the purchase money, it is stipulated that they will be given piglets first and pay in installments; piglets will be given when pre-distributing, and less cash will be obtained; piglets will be given first, and dividends will be distributed proportionally after they are raised. In terms of time arrangement, many considerations are also given to commune members. Each production team stipulates a certain amount of time for commune members to dispose of themselves, according to the different situations of male and female commune members. In order to help commune members solve the feed problem, the county has uniformly stipulated the method of distributing feed land to commune members; and mobilized commune members to use scattered land in front of and behind houses and reclaim wasteland to plant feed crops. At present, the feed land planted by commune member households in the county has reached 7,000 mu. In addition, the county also uniformly stipulates that commune members who raise a fat pig can retain a certain amount of pork for themselves, which greatly encourages the commune members' enthusiasm for pig raising.

To develop pig production, it is necessary to do a good job in epidemic prevention. Party committees at all levels in Yushan County attach great importance to this. They lead the livestock and veterinary departments to adopt the method of "training on the spot and cultivating on the spot," and have trained more than 300 veterinarians and epidemic prevention personnel, with an average of 14 in each commune. The county has established a set of livestock hygiene and epidemic prevention work network. Since the beginning of this year, the county has never experienced swine fever.

    公社、大队、小队、社员家庭都大力发展养猪
    玉山县公养私养并重生猪大增
    本报南昌17日电　江西省玉山县各级党委加强对生猪生产的领导，及时具体地解决养猪中的问题，使全县生猪飞跃上升。江西省农业厅、商业厅最近在这里联合召开了全省生猪生产现场会议，向全省各地推广玉山县发展生猪生产的先进经验。
    生猪生产一向是玉山县农民的主要收入之一，农民称它是“家庭聚宝盆”。去年该县养猪收入占农业总收入的42％，生猪销售全国十八个省市。今年由于县和公社党委一直抓紧了生猪生产，认真执行了许多有效措施，生猪生产获得了更大的成就。目前，全县养猪十七万九千头，比今年年初增长了两倍，平均每户养了三头猪。
    “千条万条，党的领导是第一条”，玉山县各级党委今年一开始就加强了对生猪生产的领导。从县到生产队的各级党组织都成立了畜牧业生产指挥部，有一名书记专门负责；平时，党委如同抓农业生产一样，定期研究、安排、检查生猪生产的工作，及时解决问题。同时，各级党委都建立了“养猪试验田”，以摸索生产经验，树立榜样，指导与带动全面。今年年初，玉山县委先后在“养猪试验田”——群力、古城公社召开了两次生猪生产现场会议，及时推广了公私并重的养猪经验，为全县生猪生产的发展找出了办法。在公社的统一领导下，公社、大队、小队、社员家庭都大力发展养猪，养猪的方式是公社、大队、小队各级建立小型养猪场，每个场养猪三十头至一百头；社员家庭利用旧有房屋改建或新建小猪栏养猪。全县各公社推广这一经验之后，充分调动了公社内养猪的积极性，挖掘了养猪的潜力。现在，全县二十二个公社建立了二十二个养猪场，养猪三千九百多头；二百五十八个生产大队建立了二百七十个养猪场，养猪三万二千多头；一千二百六十七个生产队建立了一千八百二十六个养猪场，养猪八万多头；社员家庭养猪六万多头，养猪户占总农户的91％。
    随着生猪大发展，种源、饲料都要求迅速跟上去。为此，各级党委首先根据“以猪养猪、自繁自养”的原则，采取一系列措施解决了种源问题。这些措施是：一，将全县原有的三万二千头新老母猪全部停止阉割，并领导做好母猪配种工作，达到“四不”（不误情期、不配空、不空肚、不流产）、“二全”（母猪安全生仔、小猪全成活）。二，增养一批新母猪和公猪。三，在饲养员中建立饲养母猪的责任制，保证母猪生长；同时大力推行双重配种、家畜人工授精的办法，以达到全配、全准、全生、全活、全壮。由于采取了上述措施，现在全县母猪已发展到五万头，今年增加的九万多头生猪都是本县内繁殖的仔猪。其次，各级党委根据“青饲料为主，适当搭配精饲料”的原则，及时解决了饲料问题。具体办法是：一，在不影响粮食生产的前提下，以养猪场为单位组织社员开辟饲料基地，播种青饲料作物；二，全县有一百二十种野菜野草可以做饲料，发动饲养员大力利用野菜野草发酵作青饲料；三，组织专业队培育水浮莲；四，加工玉米心、谷壳、花生壳、油菜茎等做饲料。现在，由各个集体单位和社员种植的饲料作物已有一万四千多亩，加上采摘野菜野草和水浮莲等，可以满足养猪的需要。
    在发展集体养猪的同时，各级党委积极帮助社员解决养猪中的困难，因而社员家庭生猪生产发展迅速。社员没有种猪，公社或生产队便将三十斤以下的公养小猪供应给社员饲养；社员暂时付不出购买金，便规定：先给小猪，分期付款；预分时给小猪，少得现钱；先给小猪，养大后按比例分红。在时间安排上也给予社员许多照顾，各生产队都根据男女社员的不同情况，规定了一定的时间，归社员自己个人支配。为了帮助社员解决饲料问题，全县统一规定分给社员饲料地的办法；并发动社员利用屋前屋后零星地和开垦荒地种植饲料作物。目前全县由社员家庭种植的饲料地达七千亩。此外，全县还统一规定社员养一头肥猪自留一定数量猪肉，大大鼓舞了社员的养猪积极性。
    要发展生猪生产，必须做好防疫工作。玉山县各级党委对此非常重视。他们领导畜牧兽医部门采取“就地训练、就地培养”的办法，已训练了三百多名兽医防疫员，平均每个公社有十四名。全县已经建立了一套家畜卫生防疫工作网。今年以来，这个县从未发生过猪瘟现象。
