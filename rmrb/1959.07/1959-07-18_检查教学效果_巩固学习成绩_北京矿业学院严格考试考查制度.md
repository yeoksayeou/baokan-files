To check teaching effectiveness and consolidate learning achievements, Beijing Mining College strictly implements its examination system.

    (Our Dispatch) The leaders and teachers of Beijing Mining College conscientiously implement the teaching system of examinations and assessments, strictly demanding students and promoting the improvement of teaching quality.

    In this end-of-term examination at the Mining College, the scores of various types of courses have generally and evenly increased compared to the past. Worker-peasant and transferred cadre students have made significant progress through their own hard work and the help of teachers. Many student cadres, by arranging their work and study time earlier, have grasped their studies while doing a good job in their work, and have also achieved good results in this end-of-term examination.

    As early as March of this year, at the joint meeting of the heads of departments of the Mining College, the school Party committee proposed that it is necessary to focus on the examination and assessment of students, to carefully check the teaching effectiveness through examinations and assessments, and to further consolidate and improve students' academic achievements. According to the school's regulations, all major courses were examined before the end of this semester. Minor courses and courses that do not require examinations due to a large amount of daily homework were assessed. Teachers checked the students' completion and quality of daily homework and asked some students to answer the teacher's questions.

    The administrative, Party, and Youth League organizations of each department conducted repeated studies on this end-of-term examination. On the one hand, they focused on ideological work, so that every teacher and student fully understood the purpose and significance of the examination; on the other hand, they organized students to carefully review their lessons and teachers to strengthen tutoring.

    Through the implementation of the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor, students' enthusiasm and consciousness for learning have been improved. Since the beginning of this year, most students have been able to demand themselves relatively strictly in their studies. They not only listen carefully in class, but also grasp daily extracurricular review tightly. Three weeks before the examination, the students formulated plans based on their specific circumstances, and systematically and comprehensively reviewed each course on the basis of regular review. Before the exam, the students of the whole school had reviewed the courses they were going to take at least once or twice from beginning to end, and some students reviewed four or five times. Many students spent more time and energy painstakingly studying the main chapters, main problems, and problems they did not fully understand in the course content, and tried their best to understand them thoroughly. In the examination work, the teachers also showed a serious and strict spirit. In the systematic review stage before the examination, the lecturers and tutors of each course went deep into understanding the students' situation and problems in the review, answered students' questions in a timely manner, or raised some questions to question the students and guide them to think deeply. For some courses with complicated teaching content and insufficient systematic and clear teaching, the teachers also gave the students review outlines. Many students in the electromechanical major of the Mining and Electromechanical Department heard that many students in theoretical mechanics had failed in the past few semesters and were very afraid of taking this course. After careful analysis, the teachers believed that some students did not perform well in the past because of many errors in calculation, and the key to the problem was that the theoretical concepts were not thoroughly understood. In response to this situation, they helped the students to relieve their ideological concerns, and at the same time organized them to seize theoretical review, and strive to calculate accurately on the basis of thoroughly understanding each theoretical concept. In addition to tutoring general students, teachers also paid special attention to strengthening individual tutoring for worker-peasant, transferred cadre students, and other students with learning difficulties.

    In this end-of-term examination, all the examination questions were proposed by the teachers according to the requirements of the teaching syllabus of each course, and were discussed, selected and finally reviewed by the teaching and research group or the teaching group of the same course. The requirements of the examination questions of many courses have been appropriately improved in depth and breadth, which not only examines students' understanding and mastery of theory, but also examines their ability to solve practical problems. The petrology test questions of the Coalfield Geology Department increased the part of crystal optics, which not only required microscopic identification operations, but also required theoretical explanations, unlike in the past when only problem answers were given. Among the three test questions of the mining and tunneling engineering of the coal mining department, two questions are general theoretical questions, and the third question is the preliminary plan for developing a coal mine, including the location of the shaft, the layout of the roadway, etc., and there are many problems and errors, requiring students to find them out one by one. The students were very interested in these test questions.

    The evaluation of test scores is also strict. In the oral test, the teachers of the Coal Mining Department changed the practice of marking scores on the spot. After each student finished the exam, the teacher only recorded the preliminarily determined score, and waited until all the students taking the same course had finished the exam before finally determining the score. This avoids the problem of inconsistent scoring standards between classes and before and after the same class. When evaluating students' written test papers, the teachers of the Mining and Electromechanical Department also found students for individual oral questions when they encountered situations where the scores could not be determined between the two grades, so that the work of evaluating scores was as accurate as possible.

    检查教学效果  巩固学习成绩
    北京矿业学院严格考试考查制度
    本报讯　北京矿业学院领导和教师们认真执行考试考查的教学制度，严格要求学生，促进了教学质量的提高。
    矿业学院这次期终考试中，各种类型的课程考试成绩，较过去都有普遍而均衡的上升。工农、调干学生经过自己刻苦钻研和教师的帮助，获得了显著的进步。许多学生干部，由于较早地安排了工作和学习时间，在搞好工作的同时抓紧了学习，在这次期终考试中也取得了很好的成绩。
    早在今年3月，在矿业学院各系系主任联席会议上，学校党委就提出一定要抓紧对学生的考试考查工作，通过考试考查认真检查教学效果，进一步巩固和提高学生的学习成绩。按照学校的规定，这一学期结束前，所有的主要课程一律进行了考试，对少数次要课程以及日常作业很多不需考试的课程，进行了考查，由教师检查学生日常作业完成情况及质量，并且指定一些学生回答教师的提问。
    各系行政和党、团组织对这次期终考试作了反复的研究。一方面抓紧思想工作，使每个教师和学生都充分明确考试的目的和意义；一方面组织学生认真复习功课，组织教师加强辅导。
    经过党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针的贯彻，学生的学习积极性和自觉性有了提高。今年以来，多数学生在学习上都能比较严格地要求自己，不但在课堂上认真听讲，日常的课外复习也抓得较紧。考试前三周，学生们又根据自己的具体情况订出计划，在经常复习的基础上认真对各门课程进行系统全面的总复习。到临考前，全校学生对自己要考的课程至少从头至尾地复习了一、二遍，有些学生复习了四、五遍。许多学生对课程内容中的主要章节、主要问题和自己没有全懂的问题，都用了较多的时间和精力刻苦钻研，尽量做到理解得深透。在考试工作中，教师们同样表现了认真、严格的精神。在考试前的系统复习阶段，各门课程的主讲教师和辅导教师都深入了解学生在复习中的情况和问题，及时给学生答疑，或提出一些问题，向学生质疑，引导他们深入思考。有些教学内容繁杂、讲授不够系统清楚的课程，教师们又给学生发了复习提纲。矿山机电系机电专业三年级许多学生听说理论力学课过去几学期不及格的学生较多，很怕考这门功课。教师们认真作了分析后，认为过去一些学生考得不好，计算中差错多，问题的关键在于理论概念了解得不透彻。他们针对这种情况，帮助学生解除思想顾虑，同时组织他们抓紧理论复习，在彻底弄懂每一个理论概念的基础上力求计算准确。除了对一般学生进行辅导外，教师们还特别注意对工农、调干学生和其他学习有困难的学生加强个别辅导。
    这次期终考试中，所有的考试题目都是教师们根据每门课程的教学大纲的要求提出，经过教研组或同一课程教师的教学小组讨论、挑选和最后审查决定的。不少课程的试题在深度和广度上适当提高了要求，既要考核学生对理论的理解和掌握程度，又要检查他们联系实际解决问题的能力。煤田地质系岩石学的试题里加重了晶体光学部分，不但要求做镜下鉴定操作，而且要做理论解释，不像从前那样只作问题解答。采煤系井巷工程的三个试题中，有二个题目是一般的理论题，第三个题目是开拓一个煤矿的初步方案，内容包括井筒的位置、巷道的布置等等，其中有不少问题和错误，要求学生一一找出来。学生们对这些试题感到很大的兴趣。
    考试成绩的评定也是严格的。采煤系的教师们在口试中，改变了当场批分数的作法。每个学生考完后，教师只是自己记下初步确定的成绩，等待考试同一课程的所有学生都考完后，才最后确定成绩。这样就避免了各班之间和同一班前后之间评分掌握松紧不一的毛病。矿山机电系的教师们，在评定学生笔试试卷时，遇到在两个等级的分数之间定不下成绩来的情况，还把学生找来个别进行一些口头提问，使评定成绩的工作力求确当。　（余辉音、彭应禄）（附图片）
