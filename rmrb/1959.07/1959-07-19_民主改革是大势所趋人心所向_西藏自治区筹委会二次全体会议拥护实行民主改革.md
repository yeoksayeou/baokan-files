Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, July 18th: The Second Plenary Meeting of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region held a general discussion on the 14th and 15th. Representatives from all sectors and strata of Tibet, in their speeches, warmly supported the reports on the implementation of democratic reform in Tibet made by Panchen Erdeni, Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, and Vice Chairmen Zhang Guohua and Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme. They pointed out that the implementation of democratic reform in Tibet is the general trend and the desire of the people, and only by carrying out reform can the backwardness of Tibet be fundamentally changed.

Panchen Erdeni attended the two-day meeting. Pabala Gelleg Namgyal, Vice Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Autonomous Region, spoke at the meeting on the 15th and was warmly welcomed by the representatives. A total of twenty-seven members and observers spoke at the meeting over the two days.

Jamdong Gyatso Jinme, Standing Committee Member of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, said in his speech: Tibetan feudal lords have long occupied all the main means of production in Tibet and carried out cruel exploitation and oppression of the broad masses of working people. Now, the central government is implementing a policy of redemption for the land and other means of production of the upper classes who did not participate in the rebellion and the law-abiding temples. Patriotic upper-class people in Tibet should all understand the righteousness, thank the Party and the people, and never forget this meticulous care and grace. He also expressed his willingness to stand on the side of the broad masses of the people, fulfill his responsibilities in the democratic reform, and repay the care of the Party and the people with practical actions. Sampo Tsewang Rigzin, Standing Committee Member, spoke on behalf of the group of upper-class people in Tibet he participated in, saying: Most of the people in our group used to safeguard the interests of the ruling class and serve the ruling class. In the past, we relied on feudal privileges to exploit and oppress the working people under our jurisdiction, and now we all feel that we must admit our mistakes to the working people. At present, the central government has adopted a redemption policy for us, which not only guarantees our lives, but also gives us political resettlement. We are endlessly grateful for these measures, and we will resolutely transform our thinking and serve the country and the people wholeheartedly with practical actions. Lhamin Yixi Tsultrim, Standing Committee Member and Deputy Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee, said: The bad thing that the Tibetan upper-class reactionary group launched a rebellion has turned into a good thing. It ended the rule of feudal serf owners and entered a new stage where the people are masters of their own affairs. He said that this meeting is a democratic and progressive meeting, and I will definitely turn confidence into practical actions and contribute all my strength to the work of building a democratic and socialist new Tibet. Ngapoi Tsetan Dolkar, Member of the Preparatory Committee and Acting Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Patriotic Women's Federation, said at the meeting: Patriotic and progressive monks and lay upper-class people, as well as representatives of various groups and working people, are participating in this meeting. Everyone is gathered together to not only study the Party's various policies, but also express all their opinions without reservation. This is a very meaningful event that has never happened in Tibetan history. She expressed her heartfelt support for democratic reform and pledged to contribute all her strength to the country and the people.

Representatives of the Tibetan working people, who have suffered countless hardships for generations, also spoke at the meeting over the two days. This was the first time in Tibetan history that they were able to participate in such a meeting to discuss national affairs and freely express their wishes. Among them, some were Cheba (farmers who cultivated the lord's land and provided Ula corvee labor to the feudal lord); some were Duichung (bankrupt Cheba); some were aristocratic domestic slaves; and some were craftsmen. In their speeches, they used their own tragic experiences to angrily condemn the crimes of the feudal serf system and cheer for the new life of Tibet.

Farmer observer Ba Dan (Duichung) spoke on behalf of the village groups in the suburbs of Lhasa at the meeting, saying that the implementation of democratic reform is our long-term wish. It is completely in line with the current actual situation in Tibet to carry out democratic reform in two steps. He said that it is correct to implement a redemption policy for the upper-class people who did not participate in the rebellion in the democratic reform; however, we must wage a resolute struggle against those who oppose or sabotage the reform. Laborer observer Qunpei (Cheba of Naiwu Zong) said that under the feudal serf system, we had no personal freedom, like cattle and horses, we were only speaking tools. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, we must resolutely overthrow it completely and end the barbaric serf system. Tsicheng, a sixty-two-year-old observer from the Xicheng District of Lhasa, who had been a domestic slave in the home of the rebellion leader Lhalu for twenty years, said passionately at the meeting that with the Communist Party, the people of Tibet can be masters of their own affairs. In the future, we must resolutely follow the Communist Party, listen to the Communist Party, and never forget the kindness of the Communist Party for a moment.

Also speaking at the meeting on the 14th were Gyaco Lin, Member of the Preparatory Committee and Vice President of the Tibetan Branch of the Buddhist Association, Basuo Living Buddha, Member, Wang Peisheng (Hui nationality), Member, Jieba Kanbu, Gyume Rinchen (Lama), Cui Ke Deji Yangzong, Member of the Lhasa Patriotic Women's Federation, Dolma Tsering, Member of the Lhasa Patriotic Youth Federation, Primary School Teacher Phuntsok Langjie, Gui Xiangba (upper-class person), and Chapa Gesang Wangdui (upper-class person). Also speaking at the meeting on the 15th were Angwang Nyima (shoemaker), Gesang Danzeng (tailor), Rinchen Dorje (domestic slave), Lunzhutokai, Standing Committee Member, Doza Jiangbalosang, Vice President of the Tibetan Branch of the Buddhist Association, Dorje Jiantong, Deputy Secretary-General of the Tibetan Branch of the Buddhist Association, Cai Daiwen, representative of Islam, Zhang Ming (cadre of the Tibet Military Region), and Liu Fang (cadre of the Tibet Working Committee of the CPC). In their speeches, they warmly supported the implementation of democratic reform in Tibet and unanimously expressed that they would unite and work together to complete this historical task.

Before the general discussion, panel discussions were held for several days, and the members and representatives fully discussed the three reports made by Panchen Erdeni, Zhang Guohua, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, and others. (Attached picture)

    民主改革是大势所趋人心所向
    西藏自治区筹委会二次全体会议拥护实行民主改革
    新华社拉萨18日电　西藏自治区筹备委员会第二次全体委员会议14日和15日进行了大会讨论。西藏各界、各阶层代表在发言中，热烈拥护西藏自治区筹委会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼和副主任委员张国华、阿沛·阿旺晋美关于在西藏实行民主改革问题的报告，他们指出：在西藏实行民主改革，是大势所趋，人心所向，只有进行改革，才能根本改变西藏的落后面貌。
    班禅额尔德尼出席了这两天的大会。自治区筹委会副主任委员帕巴拉·卓列朗杰15日在大会发言，受到了代表们的热烈欢迎。两天来在大会上发言的共有委员和列席代表二十七人。
    西藏自治区筹委会常务委员詹东·计晋美在发言中说：西藏封建领主长期霸占着西藏全部的主要生产资料，对广大劳动人民进行残酷的剥削和压迫，而现在中央对没有参加叛乱的上层阶级和守法的寺庙的土地等生产资料实行赎买政策，西藏爱国上层人士都应深明大义，感谢党和人民，永远不能忘掉这种无微不至的照顾和恩惠。他并表示愿意站到广大人民立场上，在民主改革中尽自己的责任，以实际行动报答党和人民的关怀。常务委员桑颇·才旺仁增代表他所参加的西藏上层人士小组发言说：我们小组中的大部分人，曾经是维护统治阶级利益和为统治阶级服务的。过去我们依靠封建特权对自己属下的劳动人民进行剥削和压迫，现在一致感到必须向劳动人民承认错误。目前中央对我们采取赎买政策，使我们生活上不但得到了保证，而且在政治上也给了安置，我们对这些措施是感恩不尽的，我们将坚决改造自己的思想，以实际行动为国家和人民全心全意地服务。筹委会常务委员兼副秘书长拉敏·益喜楚臣发言说：西藏上层反动集团发动叛乱这件坏事已经变成了好事，它结束了封建农奴主的统治，进入了人民自己当家作主的新阶段。他说，这次会议，是一个民主的会议和进步的会议，我一定把信心变成实际行动，在建设民主和社会主义的新西藏的工作中，贡献出自己的一切力量。筹委会委员、西藏爱国妇女联谊会筹委会代理主任委员阿沛·才旦卓噶在会上说：参加这次大会的有爱国进步的僧俗上层人士，有各团体和劳动人民的代表，大家团聚一起，不仅学习了党的各项政策，而且无保留地说出了自己所有的意见，这是西藏历史上不曾有过的具有很大意义的事情。她表示衷心拥护民主改革，把自己的全部力量贡献给国家和人民。
    世世代代受尽苦难的西藏劳动人民的代表们，两天来也在会上发言。他们能够参加这样的大会讨论国家大事，自由地表达自己的愿望，这在西藏历史上还是第一次。他们之中，有的是差巴（种领主的份地并给封建领主支应乌拉差役的农民）；有的是堆穷（破了产的差巴）；有的是贵族的家奴；有的是工匠。他们在发言中用自己的悲惨身世，愤怒地控诉封建农奴制度的罪恶，欢呼西藏的新生。
    农民列席代表巴单（堆穷）代表拉萨郊区各村小组在大会上发言说，实行民主改革是我们长期以来的愿望。民主改革分为两个步骤进行，是完全符合西藏当前的实际情况的。他说，在民主改革中，对未参加叛乱的上层人士实行赎卖政策，这是正确的；可是对于那些反对改革或破坏改革的分子，我们要作坚决的斗争。劳动人民列席代表群佩（乃乌宗的差巴）说，在封建农奴制度下，我们没有人身自由，像牛马一样，只是会说话的工具而已。在共产党的领导下，我们要坚决把它彻底推翻，结束野蛮的农奴制度。拉萨西城区列席代表、六十二岁的次成，在叛乱头子拉鲁家里当了二十年家奴，他在会上激昂地说，有了共产党，我们西藏人民才能当家作主。今后我们要坚决跟着共产党走，听共产党的话，一时一刻也不能忘记共产党的恩情。
    在14日大会上发言的，还有筹委会委员、佛教协会西藏分会副会长嘉措林，委员巴索活佛，委员王沛生（回族），结巴堪布，居美仁增（喇嘛），拉萨市爱国妇女联谊会委员崔科·德及扬宗，拉萨市爱国青年联谊会会员卓玛次仁，小学教员平措朗杰，桂香巴（上层人士），恰巴·格桑旺堆（上层人士）。在15日大会上发言的，还有昂旺尼玛（鞋匠），格桑丹增（成衣工），仁增多吉（家奴），常务委员伦珠陶凯，佛协西藏分会副会长多扎·江巴洛桑，佛协西藏分会副秘书长多吉詹东，伊斯兰教代表蔡代文，张铭（西藏军区干部），刘芳（中共西藏工委干部）等。他们在发言中，热烈拥护在西藏实行民主改革，一致表示要团结一致共同完成这个历史任务。
