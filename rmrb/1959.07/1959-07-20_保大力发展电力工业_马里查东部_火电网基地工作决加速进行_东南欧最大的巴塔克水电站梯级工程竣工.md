Xinhua News Agency, Sofia: The Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Council of Ministers issued a resolution on the 15th regarding accelerating the construction of the "Maritsa East" thermal power grid.

The resolution pointed out that the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Council of Ministers have always paid special attention to the establishment of the thermal power grid base. Thanks to the care of the Party and the efforts of the working people, as well as the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, power stations with a total generating capacity of 590,000 kilowatts have been put into production since September 1944. Electricity generation has increased from 31.1 million kilowatt-hours in 1944 to 300.4 million kilowatt-hours, an increase of 8.7 times.

The resolution went on to say that in order to achieve the tasks put forward by the Central Committee and the government of the Bulgarian Communist Party—to complete the Third Five-Year Plan in three to four years and ensure the rapid development of the Bulgarian economy—it is required to produce 6 to 7 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity in 1962, instead of the planned 5 billion kilowatt-hours; and to produce 10 to 12 billion kilowatt-hours in 1965.

The resolution stated that the construction of "Maritsa East" is a project of paramount importance to the entire country. A series of measures are now being drafted to accelerate the construction of "Maritsa East." The first batch of turbine generator units in the "Maritsa East" thermal power center will begin supplying electricity in the third quarter of 1960.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, July 18: Recently, a huge water conservancy project in Bulgaria—the Batak Hydropower Station Cascade Project—was completed. This project is one of the largest construction projects in Bulgaria in the fifteen years since the establishment of the people's regime.

The Batak Hydropower Station Cascade is located in the Rila-Rhodope Mountains in southwestern Bulgaria—one of the areas richest in water resources in Bulgaria. According to surveys, three hydropower station cascades can be built in the Rila-Rhodope Mountains. These hydropower station cascades can consist of thirteen hydropower stations with a total generating capacity of 1.23 million kilowatts, and the annual power generation will be more than 2.8 billion kilowatt-hours. In addition, eleven reservoirs can be built to ensure irrigation for about 2 million decares (each decare equals 1.5 mu) of arable land. The Batak Hydropower Station Cascade is part of the aforementioned huge water conservancy project plan. Construction of this hydropower station cascade began in 1953. It includes four reservoirs and three hydropower stations, with a total generating capacity of 220,000 kilowatts, which is almost twice the generating capacity of the power stations built in Bulgaria during the bourgeois regime. The Batak Hydropower Station Cascade generates 605 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. The Batak Hydropower Station is unparalleled not only in Bulgaria, but also in the entire Southeast Europe. The entire project of the Batak Hydropower Station Cascade has been completed.

    新华社索非亚讯　保加利亚共产党中央委员会和部长会议15日发表了关于加速建设“马里查东部”的火力发电网的决议。
    决议指出，保共中央和部长会议一向特别注意建立火力发电网基地的工作。由于党的关怀和劳动人民的努力，以及苏联和其他一些社会主义国家兄弟般的援助，从1944年9月到目前为止，已有发电能力共为五十九万瓩的电站投入了生产，发电量从1944年的三万一千一百万增加到了三十万零四千万度，即增加了八点七倍。
    决议接着说，要实现保共中央和政府提出的任务——在三、四年内完成第三个五年计划、保证保加利亚经济的飞快发展，就要求在1962年生产六、七十亿度电，而不是计划所定的五十亿度电；在1965年生产一百亿到一百二十亿度电。
    决议说，“马里查东部”的建设对全国来说是具有头等意义的项目。现在正在拟定加速“马里查东部”建设的一系列措施。“马里查东部”火力发电中心的第一批透平发电机组，将在1960年的第三季度开始供电。
    新华社索非亚18日电　最近，在保加利亚有一项巨大的水利工程——巴塔克水电站梯级工程竣工。这项工程是保加利亚在人民政权建立十五年来的最大建设项目之一。
    巴塔克水电站梯级位于保加利亚西南部的里拉罗多彼山区——保加利亚水力资源最富的地区之一。据勘查证明，在里拉罗多彼山区可以建筑三个水电站梯级。这些水电站梯级可由十三个水电站组成，总发电能力可达到一百二十三万瓩，每年的发电量将在二十八亿度以上。此外，还可以修筑十一个水库，保证灌溉约二百万狄卡尔（每狄卡尔合一市亩半）的耕地。巴塔克水电站梯级是上述巨大水利工程计划中的一部分。这个水电站梯级是在1953年开始建设的。它包括四个水库和三个水电站，总发电能力为二十二万瓩，这个数字差不多比保加利亚在资产阶级执政时期所建造的电站的发电能力多一倍。巴塔克水电站梯级每年的发电量为六亿零五百万度。巴塔克水电站不仅在保加利亚，同时在整个东南欧也是无以伦比的。巴塔克水电站梯级的整个工程项目都已经完工。
