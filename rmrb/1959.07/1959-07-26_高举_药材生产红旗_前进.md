Advance High Holding the "Medicinal Material Production Red Flag"
The Chinese Communist Party, Wuxi County Committee, Sichuan

Wuxi County is located in a mountainous area with vast land and little farmland, abundant in medicinal materials. Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, both grain and medicinal material production have significantly increased, especially after the establishment of advanced cooperatives and people's communes, the speed of grain and medicinal material production has been even faster. In 1958, the county's total grain output increased by 83.1% compared to 1957, and the total output of medicinal materials increased from 8,480 dan in 1957 to 18,232 dan, an increase of 115%; the total output value of medicinal materials also increased by 216.58%.

In 1958, the broad masses of the county, with soaring enthusiasm, established two medicinal material farms, twenty-three medicinal material bases, four people's communes mainly engaged in medicinal material management, and two hundred specialized teams, completing a medicinal material planting area of more than 23,000 mu, an expansion of eleven times compared to 1957. On the basis of the 1958 Great Leap Forward, the county had completed the planting of various medicinal materials on 65,382 mu from January to May 1959, completing 100.6% of the annual planting area, nearly doubling the total planting area in 1958. Because we achieved some success in medicinal material production, we were awarded the title of "National Medicinal Material Production Red Flag County" last year. Our work was carried out in the following manner:

Strengthening leadership and unifying thinking. At the beginning of 1958, the county committee proposed "While focusing on grain production, we must vigorously develop medicinal material production," and put forward the idea of "No barren mountains, poor mountains offering treasures, hard work for three years, medicinal materials becoming gardens." At that time, the understanding of some cadres was inconsistent. Some believed that "Developing medicinal material production would compete with the agricultural Great Leap Forward for land, labor, and time." Some also said, "Lacking seeds, not understanding technology, and with few people, the Party committee's involvement in medicinal materials is meddling in other people's business," and so on. In response to the above thoughts, the county committee promptly organized open discussions and debates, analyzing the favorable conditions for developing medicinal material production. Because of the unified thinking and strengthened leadership, everyone was full of confidence and enthusiasm, quickly forming a mass movement to vigorously engage in medicinal material production.

General survey of resources and implementation of planning. In order to understand the county's medicinal material resources, the county committee transferred 130 cadres to organize a medicinal material survey team, going deep into the countryside to widely promote the policy of developing medicinal material production and mobilize the masses to survey medicinal material resources; in more than fifty days, a total of more than 240 kinds of medicinal materials were discovered, basically clarifying the reserves and distribution of medicinal materials. According to the survey data, the county committee formulated the policy of "Relying on the masses, combining large and small scale, and taking both long-term and short-term into account" for developing medicinal material production, and under the leadership of the county committee, formulated the county's 1959 plan for developing medicinal material production. After full discussion by various districts, townships, communes, and teams, they developed their own plans at each level, ensuring that the plans were implemented to the team, household, and individual, and then seized the season to organize production. At the same time, commercial departments signed seed and harvest guarantee contracts with communes (teams), greatly stimulating the enthusiasm of the masses to develop medicinal material production.

Seed collection in the southern mountains, seedling transfer in the northern mountains, and searching for seed sources from all directions. After the expansion of the county's medicinal material area, there was a shortage of seeds and seedlings. The county carried out two large-scale campaigns to collect and harvest seeds, timely solving the difficulties of seed and seedling shortages.

Universally imparting technology and training professional talents. With the expansion of medicinal material area and the increase in varieties, solving technical problems became an extremely important task. We have trained more than 1,000 technicians.

Clarifying the scope of operation and reasonably distributing income. In order to promote the great development of medicinal material production, while adhering to the national plan and taking into account local needs, we adopted the following measures: household planting and large-scale wild medicinal materials are all uniformly managed by the commune (team) collectively; scattered and small-scale medicinal materials, without affecting collective management and collective work, are allowed for commune members to collect themselves and plant a small amount in vacant land, with the income belonging to the commune members. For collectively managed medicinal materials (mainly collecting wild medicinal materials), two methods were adopted for income distribution: one is to evaluate work and record points by day, and reward 20% of the daily medicinal material digging income exceeding the value of agricultural labor days; the other is not to record work points, but to pay a certain remuneration with reference to the harvest value.

In order to develop medicinal material production better and faster, we implemented the spirit of combining "key development with universal flowering," and put forward the slogan of "Planting more, planting well, managing carefully, and managing diligently." In addition to seizing the time to rush planting, all localities universally carried out field management and fertilization of medicinal materials. The early-sown medicinal materials in the county are now growing strong and leafy, and the vast majority of the late-sown medicinal materials have germinated and emerged.

    高举“药材生产红旗”前进
    中共四川巫溪县委会
    巫溪县地属山区，地大田少，盛产药材。解放以后在党的领导下，粮食、药材均有显著增加，特别是在高级合作化和人民公社化后，粮食、药材增产的速度更快。1958年全县粮食总产量比1957年增加了83.1％，药材总产量由1957年八千四百八十担增加到一万八千二百三十二担，增加了115％；药材的总产值也随着增加了216.58％。
    1958年全县广大人民以冲天的干劲，建立了两个药材场，二十三个药材基地，四个以经营药材为主的人民公社和二百个专业队，完成了二万三千多亩药材种植面积，比1957年扩大了十一倍。在1958年大跃进的基础上，全县1959年1至5月已完成的各种药材种植面积六万五千三百八十二亩，完成了全年种植面积100.6％，比1958年全年种植面积翻了将近两番。由于我们在药材生产上获得一些成绩，去年受到“全国药材生产红旗县”的奖励。我们的工作是这样进行的：
    加强领导，统一思想。1958年初，县委提出了“在大抓粮食生产的同时，要大力发展药材生产”，并提出了“要荒山不荒，穷山献宝，苦战三年，药材成园”。当时部分干部的认识是不一致的。有的认为：“发展药材生产要与农业大跃进争土地、争劳力、争时间”。有的还说：“既缺种子，又不懂技术，人手也少，党委抓药材是管闲事”，等等。县委针对以上思想及时组织鸣放辩论，分析了在发展药材生产中的有利条件。由于统一了思想，加强了领导，因而大家信心百倍，干劲十足，迅速形成大搞药材生产的群众运动。
    普查资源，规划落实。为了摸清全县药材资源，县委抽调了一百三十名干部，组织了药材普查大队，深入农村，一方面广泛开展发展药材生产政策的宣传，一方面发动群众普查药材资源；在五十多天中，先后发现药材共二百四十余种，基本查清了药材的蕴藏量和分布情况。县委根据普查资料，因地制宜的制订了“依靠群众，大（宗）小（宗）并举，长（多年生）短（一年生）兼顾”的发展药材生产的方针，并在县委的领导下制定了1959年全县发展药材生产的规划。经过各区、乡、社、队充分讨论以后，层层制订了自己的规划，使计划落实到队、到户、到人，然后抓紧季节，组织生产。同时商业部门与社（队）签订保种保收合同，大大激发了群众发展药材生产的积极性。
    南山采种，北山移苗，四面八方寻找种源。全县药材面积扩大后，种、苗不足。全县开展了两次大规模的采种、收种突击运动，及时解决了缺种、缺苗的困难。
    普遍传授技术，培训专业人材。随着药材面积扩大、品种增多，解决技术问题就成为一项极其重要的工作。我们已培养出技术人员一千余名。
    明确经营范围，合理分配收益。为了促进药材生产大发展，在服从国家计划的前提下兼顾当地的需要，我们采取：家种、野生大宗的药材全部统一由社（队）集体经营；零星小宗而分散的药材在不影响集体经营和集体出工的前提下，允许社员自己采集和利用空隙地少量地种一些，收入归社员所有。集体经营的药材（主要是采集野生药材）在收益分配上采取了两种办法：一种是按日评工记分，并对每日挖采药材收入超过农业劳动日价值的部分提20％作奖励；一种是不记工分，参照收获价值付给一定报酬。
    为了把药材生产发展得更好更快，我们贯彻了“重点发展与普遍开花”相结合的精神，提出了“种多、种好、管细、管勤”的口号。各地除抓紧抢栽抢种以外，普遍对药材进行了田间管理和施肥工作。全县早播的药材现在长得枝壮叶肥，晚播的药材绝大部分发芽出苗。
