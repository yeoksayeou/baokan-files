    Household Chores Arranged Well
    The Xia Ban (Lower Slope) Commune Party Committee in Ruichang County, Jiangxi Province, is helping commune members arrange their family life during the summer harvest and planting season, so that female commune members can wholeheartedly devote themselves to the "Double Rush" battle.

    Zhu Yunju, the First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, and Wang Yaxi, the Secretary, went deep into Xia Ban, Bei Lian (North Union) and other brigades to help commune members arrange their time, so that commune members still have time to do household chores when production is busy. Their method is to give different amounts of time according to different situations. For example, if commune members privately raise pigs that need green fodder, the commune stipulates: those who raise large pigs weighing more than 50 jin (25 kg) are given three days for a woman to collect fodder, and those weighing less than 50 jin are given two days.

    The state-owned commercial department stationed in the commune has dispatched fifteen peddlers to deliver goods to the door, allowing female commune members to complete their household chores as soon as possible, so as to invest in the "Double Rush" in a timely manner. After such arrangements, many female commune members have completed their household chores and are preparing to join the "Double Rush." Jiang Xi

    家务事安排好
    江西瑞昌县夏坂公社党委帮助社员安排夏收夏种期间的家庭生活，使女社员一心一意的投入双抢战斗。
    公社党委第一书记朱运巨和书记王亚西分别深入到夏坂、北联等大队，帮助社员安排时间，使社员在生产繁忙时，仍然有空搞家务。他们的办法是，根据不同的情况，给予不同的时间。例如社员私养的猪要采青饲料，公社就规定：养一头五十斤以上大猪的，给一个妇女三天采集饲料的时间，五十斤以下的给两天时间。
    设在这个社的国营商业部门，派出了十五个货郎担，送货上门，让女社员尽快的把家务事办好，以便及时投入双抢。经过这样安排，许多女社员已经办妥了家事，准备投入“双抢”。　姜西
