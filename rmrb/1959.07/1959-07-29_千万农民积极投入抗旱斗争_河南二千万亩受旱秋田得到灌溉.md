    Millions of Farmers Actively Engage in the Fight Against Drought
    20 Million Mu of Drought-Stricken Autumn Fields in Henan Irrigated
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 28th July: In Henan Province, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, millions of farmers are engaging in the fight against drought every day. As of the 24th, more than 21 million mu of drought-stricken autumn fields across the province had been irrigated.
    Since entering July, rainfall in Henan Province has been scarce, coupled with high temperatures and high evaporation rates, drought has developed rapidly. As of the 22nd, except for some areas in western and northern Henan where soil moisture was relatively good, other areas had experienced varying degrees of drought.
    Currently, the province has established eight drought-fighting zones based on region, river, and canal system. Each zone has established a headquarters, with the local Prefectural Party Committee First Secretary personally commanding the operations. Drought-fighting headquarters and command posts have been established at the provincial, county, and commune levels. Each special zone and county has transferred 70% to 80% of its cadres to go deep into the rural areas to lead the masses in fighting the drought. All four large-scale Yellow River diversion irrigation canals—Sanyizhai, Gangli, Dagong—and nine culverts, including the Yu Bei People's Victory Canal and the Kaifeng Hegangkou Yellow River irrigation area, and three inverted siphons have been opened to release water. This has ensured that the drought-stricken autumn fields in the new and old Yellow River irrigation areas have been irrigated in a timely manner. Many people's communes in irrigation areas have adopted methods of scientific management, rational irrigation, and water conservation to improve irrigation efficiency and expand the irrigated area. In the old irrigation areas, such as Xinxiang and six other counties, cities, and fifteen people's communes, the universal adoption of economical water use and water measurement methods such as “nozzle aqueducts” and “board measuring weirs” has greatly improved irrigation efficiency. In the new irrigation areas, the common practice is to build canals while irrigating, to expand the irrigated area as much as possible. More than four thousand medium and small-sized reservoirs across the province have also played a significant role in this drought resistance.
    People in water-lifting irrigation areas and hilly and mountainous areas have adopted methods such as waterwheel groups, pole-and-bucket forests, and using pots and jars, taking turns day and night to draw and carry water to irrigate the fields. To date, more than 500,000 water wells and more than 490,000 pits and ponds have been utilized. In order to deliver water to the highland and drought-stricken autumn fields where water sources are particularly scarce, many areas have launched "a thousand people carrying a thousand loads, ten thousand people with ten thousand buckets" campaigns to protect seedlings from the drought. According to incomplete statistics, the area irrigated by spot watering has reached more than 2 million mu across the province. Many areas have also paid attention to improving irrigation methods and ensuring irrigation quality during the intensive drought resistance efforts.
    In the effort to protect seedlings from the drought, factories, schools, troops, and commercial, medical, and other departments throughout the province have sent large numbers of personnel and materials to provide support. Factories in Kaifeng and Shangqiu alone selected 156 technical backbones to lead 5,780 workers, who went to the front lines of the drought to install and repair various water-lifting tools for the farmers. The commercial departments of Neihuang County organized sixteen professional teams for the supply of drought-fighting materials, rushing to the rural areas to guarantee supply. More than 300 medical personnel from Xuchang County formed 55 mobile medical teams, carrying various heatstroke prevention medicines, and went deep into the fields to carry out medical activities.
    Since the 20th, although some areas of Henan Province have received rainfall, the drought situation in most areas continues to develop. To this end, the Henan Provincial Party Committee convened a second emergency telephone conference on drought resistance on the 25th. It required all localities to ensure: do not stop when it drizzles, do not slack off when it rains heavily. Overcome the drought by adapting to local conditions and strive for a bumper harvest.

    千万农民积极投入抗旱斗争
    河南二千万亩受旱秋田得到灌溉
    新华社郑州28日电　河南省每天有上千万的农民在各级党委的领导下，投入抗旱斗争。到24日止，全省已有二千一百多万亩受旱秋田得到灌溉。
    进入7月以来，河南省降雨很少，加上气温高、蒸发量大，旱象迅速发展，到22日止，全省除豫西和豫北的部分地区墒情较好外，其他地区都出现了不同程度的旱象。
    目前，全省按地区、河道、渠系，建立了八个抗旱区，每个区都成立了指挥部，由当地地委第一书记亲自坐阵指挥。省、县、社层层建立了抗旱指挥部、指挥所。各专区和县抽调70％到80％的干部，深入农村领导群众抗旱。全省现有的三义寨、岗李、大功等四个大型引黄灌溉渠及豫北人民胜利渠、开封黑岗口引黄灌区等九座涵闸、三个虹吸管全部开闸放水。使新、老引黄灌区的受旱秋田，及时得到了灌溉。许多灌区的人民公社采取了科学管理、合理灌溉、节约用水的办法，提高浇地效率和扩大灌溉面积。老灌区的新乡等六个县、市、十五个人民公社，普遍推广了经济用水和
  “喷嘴渡槽”、“挣板量水堰”等量水灌田方法，大大提高了浇地效率。新灌区普遍采取了边灌溉、边修渠，尽量扩大灌溉面积。全省四千多个中、小型水库在这次抗旱中也发挥了巨大的作用。
    处在提水灌溉地区和丘陵、山区的人们，采用水车群、吊杆林、盆盆罐罐齐上阵的办法，冒暑日夜轮番车水、担水灌田。到目前止，已经利用起来的水井达五十多万眼，坑、塘四十九万多个。许多地区为了把水送到岗地和水源特别困难的受旱秋田里，开展了“千人千条担、万人万副桶”的抗旱保苗活动。据不完全统计，全省点浇面积已达二百多万亩。许多地区在突击抗旱中，还注意改进浇水方法、保证浇水质量。
    在抗旱保苗中，省内各地工厂、学校、部队和商业、医疗等部门，都抽出大批人力、物资支援。仅开封、商丘两个市各工厂，即挑选了一百五十六名技术骨干率领五千七百八十名工人，分赴抗旱前线给农民安装和修理各种提水工具。内黄县商业部门组织了十六个抗旱物资供应专业队，赶赴农村保证供应。许昌县三百多名医务人员组成五十五个巡回医疗小组，携带各种防暑药品，深入田间开展医疗活动。
    20日以来，河南省部分地区虽然降了雨，但大部分地区的旱象仍在继续发展，为此，中共河南省委在25日召开了第二次抗旱紧急电话会议。要求各地切实做到：小雨不停手、大雨不松劲。因地制宜地战胜干旱，力争丰收。（附图片）
