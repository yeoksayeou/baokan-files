    Special Attention Should Be Paid to Saving Industrial Electricity
    By a staff commentator
    Electricity is a pioneer of socialist construction, an important guarantee for the leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and is closely related to people's lives. Like all construction undertakings, the development speed of China's electric power industry is very fast. In 1958, the country's power generation increased by 47% compared with 1957, and the newly added power generation equipment capacity was equivalent to four-fifths of the total installed capacity of the First Five-Year Plan. However, due to the continuous investment in production of newly built and expanded factories and mines, the continuous improvement of mechanization and automation in industrial production, the gradual expansion of agricultural irrigation and mechanized farming area, and the improvement of people's living standards, more and more electricity is needed. Despite such high-speed development of the power industry, it still cannot keep up with the needs.
    The way to solve this contradiction is to start from two aspects: one is to increase sources, build new factories, add new equipment, expand power sources, generate more electricity, and supply more electricity; the other is to reduce expenditure, everyone takes action, and does everything possible to tap the potential of existing electrical equipment, and save every kilowatt-hour that can be saved.
    Judging from the situation over the years, the potential for saving electricity is very large. For example, during the First Five-Year Plan period, a total of 1.1 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity were saved nationwide. This electricity can be used to smelt 1.45 million tons of electric furnace steel and mine 77 million tons of coal. In electricity consumption, industrial electricity consumption accounts for 85% of the total electricity consumption, so special emphasis and attention should be paid to saving industrial electricity. However, this work has not yet received universal attention from all industrial and mining enterprises. In some industrial and mining enterprises, there are still phenomena of low utilization rate of electrical equipment and low power factor; and the unit power consumption of similar products often varies greatly. For example, the highest power consumption per ton of electric furnace steel requires 830 kilowatt-hours, while the lowest only requires 490 kilowatt-hours, a difference of almost one time. In the same enterprise producing the same product, power consumption is sometimes high and sometimes low. Why does this phenomenon occur? The main reason is that there is insufficient understanding of the importance of rational and economical use of electricity. For example, some people believe that the proportion of electricity bills in production costs is not large, and electricity is invisible and intangible, unlike raw materials that have to be bought outside, so they do not pay attention to control. In fact, electricity is as important as raw materials. Without it, production cannot be carried out. It seems that spending a few more electricity bills does not matter much, but wasting the country's important power resources has a great impact. Others, although they know that saving electricity is important, are afraid that saving electricity will affect production and quality. In fact, we require saving electricity on the premise of not affecting production, and saving electricity is precisely to further meet the needs of production. Saving electricity is not only not contradictory to production, but can also improve production, improve quality, reduce costs, and thus promote production. In order to save electricity, many factories have mobilized the masses to improve unreasonable production equipment and operating procedures, and as a result, they have pushed technological innovation forward and achieved a double harvest of increased production and electricity saving. For example, the No. 1 workshop of Tianjin No. 1 People's Paper Mill, which is published today, originally had insufficient power, which almost affected the completion of the plan. Due to a series of technical measures, not only the contradiction between insufficient power and the leap forward was resolved, but the monthly plan was overfulfilled by 10 to 20 tons. There are many similar examples. This shows that saving electricity can be completely combined with improving production and with increasing production and saving, and this is also the fundamental way to save electricity. If every enterprise can do this and persist in doing so, it will not only receive the benefits obtained by the above-mentioned enterprises, but more importantly, it will save the country's investment in power generation equipment, greatly alleviate the shortage of power supply, and enable more electricity to play a greater role in socialist construction.
    In order to make full use of power sources, in addition to the user departments paying attention to saving, the power supply departments should also do a good job of adjusting the power load at any time, narrowing the distance between the power supply "peak" and "valley" to achieve balanced power supply and give full play to the utilization rate of power supply and generation equipment. All industrial enterprises should also assist the power departments, and under the unified arrangement of the relevant departments, appropriately adjust shifts and weekly rest, make full use of the "valley" and avoid the "peak."
    Due to industrial development and the increase in urban population, lighting electricity consumption is also increasing. Although lighting electricity consumption accounts for a small proportion of total electricity consumption, and the value of saving from a single household is not very significant, if many households pay attention to saving, the number will be quite considerable.

    要特别重视节约工业用电
    本报评论员
    电，是社会主义建设的先行，是工农业生产跃进的重要保证，与人民生活的关系十分密切。像各项建设事业一样，我国电力工业的发展速度是很快的。1958年全国发电量比1957年增长了47％，新增加的发电设备容量相当于第一个五年计划装机总容量的五分之四。但是，由于新建扩建厂矿的不断投入生产，工业生产中机械化自动化程度的不断提高，农业灌溉、机械耕作面积的逐渐扩大，以及人民生活水平的提高，需要的电力越来越多，尽管电力工业如此高速度地发展，但仍然赶不上需要。
    解决这个矛盾的途径要从两方面着手：一是开源，建新厂，增添新设备，扩大电源，多发电，多供电；二是节流，大家动手，千方百计地挖掘现有电力设备的潜力，节约每一度可以节约的电力。
    从历年的情况来看，节约用电的潜力是很大的。如在第一个五年计划期间，全国共节约了十一亿度电力，用这些电可以冶炼一百四十五万吨电炉钢，可以开采七千七百万吨煤。在电力消耗中，工业用电量要占全部用电量的85％，因此应该特别强调和重视节约工业用电。但是，对于这一工作，目前还没有引起所有工矿企业的普遍重视。在部分工矿企业里，还存在着用电设备利用率低和用电力率不高的现象；在同类产品单位耗电量上也往往相差悬殊。如每吨电炉钢的耗电量最高的要用八百三十度，最低的只用电四百九十度，几乎相差一倍。在同一企业生产同一样产品，耗电量也时高、时低。为什么会出现这种现象呢？主要是对合理与节约用电的重要性认识不足。如有的人认为电费在生产成本中占的比重不大，而电又是看不见摸不到的，不像原材料那样要出门去买，因此就不注意控制。其实，电和原材料同样重要，没有它就不能生产，多花几个电费似乎关系不大，但浪费了国家的重要动力资源，影响却很大。还有的人虽然知道节约用电重要，但又怕节约用电会影响产量和质量。其实，我们是要求在不影响生产的前提下节约用电，而节约用电又恰恰是为了进一步满足生产的需要。节约用电不仅与生产没有矛盾，相反还可以提高生产、改进质量、降低成本，从而促进生产。不少工厂为了节约用电，发动群众改进了不合理的生产设备和工艺规程，结果把技术革新推向前进，达到了增产节电双丰收，如今天发表的天津第一人民造纸厂一车间原来电力不足，几乎影响计划的完成，由于采取了一系列技术措施，不但解决了电力不足与跃进的矛盾，反而使月计划超产了十吨到二十吨。类似这样例子是很多的。这说明节约用电完全可以与改进生产结合起来，与增产节约结合起来，而这也是节约用电的根本途径。如果每一个企业都能这样做，并且坚持下去，那不仅会收到上述企业所得到的好处，更重要的是节约了国家在发电设备方面的投资，大大缓和了电力供应的不足，使更多的电能在社会主义建设中发挥更大的作用。
    为了充分利用电源，除了使用部门注意节约外，供电部门还应随时做好调整电力负荷工作，缩小供电“高峰”和“低谷”的距离，达到均衡供电，充分发挥供用发电设备的利用率。而各工业企业也要协助电力部门，在有关部门的统一安排下，适当调整班次和周休，充分利用“低谷”，避开“高峰”。
    由于工业发展，城市人口增多，照明用电也日益增加。虽然照明用电在全部电力消耗中所占的比重不大，从一户来说节约的价值不十分显著，但是聚少成多，千户，万户都来注意节约，那数字就相当可观。
