    The People's Republic of Mongolia, our close neighbor, is a country with vast land, rich resources, and magnificent mountains and rivers. For thirty-eight years, under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, Mongolia has achieved tremendous accomplishments, developing from a purely pastoral country into an agro-pastoral-industrial nation that is building a modern economy and culture. 88.2% of Mongolia's land is grassland, and 70% of the population is engaged in animal husbandry. Calculated by the national population, there are an average of twenty-seven livestock per person, ranking first in the world. In addition to supplying the people's daily food and clothing, livestock products account for the vast majority of exports. Most of Mongolia's industrial products use livestock products as raw materials, and the main part of the state budget revenue also comes from animal husbandry. All of this shows that the development of animal husbandry is of great significance for improving the material and cultural living standards of the Mongolian people and for developing Mongolia's socialist construction.
    The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the government have always attached importance to the development of animal husbandry, regarding it as the basic sector of the national economy, and the development of other sectors and the speed of economic and cultural construction largely depend on the state of animal husbandry. For thirty-eight years, under the leadership of the Party and the government, the Mongolian people have overcome the backwardness and poverty left over from the old system, changed the relations of production in animal husbandry, and adopted a series of measures to increase the number of livestock and improve the output of livestock products, greatly improving the production enthusiasm of the herdsmen. Now, the number of livestock in Mongolia has increased by 1.5 times compared with the early days of the revolution.
    The correct path to ensure the great development of animal husbandry and guarantee a prosperous life for herdsmen is to enter socialism through the cooperativization of animal husbandry. In recent years, due to the correct policies of the Party and the government and the improvement of the political consciousness of the herdsmen, especially due to the measures taken in animal husbandry during the Second Five-Year Plan (1953-1957), which convincingly demonstrated the superiority of the cooperative economy, the speed of cooperativization has greatly accelerated. In order to strengthen the leadership of the cooperatives, in 1953, the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party passed the "Resolution on Consolidating Herdsmen's Production Cooperatives Organizationally and Economically." In 1955, a representative conference of advanced workers in herdsmen's production cooperatives was convened, which adopted the model charter of the cooperatives, stipulated the labor quotas for members, and implemented the system of distribution according to work, further consolidating the cooperatives organizationally. During this period, the Party and the government also trained cadres for the cooperatives and added grass-cutting stations to serve the cooperatives. Due to these efforts, the socialist component of Mongolia's animal husbandry developed into a huge force during the Second Five-Year Plan. In 1952, the number of herding households participating in cooperatives accounted for 5%, and in 1957 it increased to 35%. The number of livestock participating in cooperatives also increased from 500,000 to 9.4 million.
    The new Three-Year Plan adopted by the 13th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party in March 1958 greatly inspired the production enthusiasm and political activism of the Mongolian working people. The movement of working herdsmen to join cooperatives in response to the call of the 13th Congress of the Party flourished. Especially since the Second Plenary Session of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party in November 1958, under the leadership of the Party, the cooperativization of animal husbandry has developed by leaps and bounds, which is very prominent in Mongolia's socialist construction undertakings. At the time of the Second Plenary Session, 56% of herding households had joined the cooperatives, and by the end of January of this year, it had grown to 87%. According to the communique of the Mongolian State Statistics Bureau, by April of this year, 97.7% of households had joined the cooperatives. Mongolia's animal husbandry cooperativization work has been basically completed.
    This achievement is a brilliant victory achieved by the Mongolian people under the leadership of the People's Revolutionary Party in the cooperativization of animal husbandry. Because the cooperativization of the remaining private handicraft industry and private commerce was also completed at the same time, the individual economy was eliminated in urban and rural areas. The economy of a unified socialist system based on the two forms of socialist ownership—state-owned and cooperative-owned—occupies an absolute dominant position in the Mongolian national economy. With the tremendous changes in the social economy, Mongolia's herdsmen have become a new socialist class. The alliance of workers and herdsmen led by the working class is being further consolidated.
    In the process of accelerating the cooperativization of animal husbandry, the Party and the government have given great support to the cooperatives. In January of this year, the Party Central Committee issued a call, requesting cadres of government agencies to work in the cooperatives to enhance the leadership of the cooperatives. Many deputy ministers of the central government and leading comrades of the provinces, as well as a large number of cadres of government agencies, responded to this call. In Ulan Bator alone, more than 500 cadres signed up. The Central Senior Party School has added short-term training courses for training cooperative cadres. The Party Central Committee and the Council of Ministers have made a special resolution for this group of cadres participating in cooperative work. There is no doubt that this will play an extremely important role in the consolidation and development of cooperatives.
    In addition, the Party and the government also provide financial and material assistance. The loans granted to cooperatives in 1959 increased by 5 million tugriks (Mongolian currency) compared with 1958, and it is stipulated that if it is not enough, it can be increased. The loans issued to cooperatives in the first quarter of this year increased by 55.3% compared with the same period last year. The state's investment in agriculture and animal husbandry in 1959 increased by 32% compared with the budget execution in 1958. Among them, the financial expenditures for veterinary medicine, animal husbandry technical measures, improvement of livestock breeds, establishment of feed bases, and well drilling have all increased compared with the budget execution in 1958. Recently, the Presidium of the Great People's Hural abolished the building tax and land tax, which greatly facilitated the settlement of cooperatives.
    With the elimination of the decentralized individual economy, the state's basic-level administrative organs, which were established to adapt to the decentralized individual economy, have completed their historical mission. Therefore, on the basis of being closer to the working people and production, the work of reforming administrative organs and merging cooperatives is carried out simultaneously. After the herdsmen, who were previously distributed in more than 2,500 villages, joined the cooperatives, they formed production teams and production groups respectively. Therefore, the continued existence of the village is no longer necessary. Practice has proved that the unity of county leadership and cooperative leadership is correct. After the county and the cooperative are merged, there are a total of 426 counties-cooperatives in the country. The result of abolishing the township-level institutions is that it saves the country more than 3 million tugriks in administrative expenses each year. The unity of the county and the cooperative can not only strengthen the leadership of the cooperative, improve the work of state organs, and save expenses, but also enable more people to participate in the production of the cooperative, organize larger production and construction activities, more widely use modern machines and advanced technologies, promote the settlement of herdsmen and increase the number of livestock, and more rapidly promote the socialist construction of agriculture and animal husbandry.
    After the cooperativization of animal husbandry and the merger of counties and cooperatives, the herdsmen's production enthusiasm has rapidly increased. For example, the "Altai Peak" cooperative in Kobdo Province, which overfulfilled various production plans in 1958, issued a challenge letter to cooperatives across the country in May of this year, which was warmly welcomed by all members. In order to meet the second cooperative congress to be held in the fourth quarter of this year with higher labor achievements, this cooperative has put forward a new plan for 1959 and challenged cooperatives and members across the country. The plan stipulates that livestock will increase by 20.3% in 1959; the three-year plan for milk production and wool shearing will be completed ahead of schedule; members with labor will participate in the labor of the cooperative, and the number of labor days stipulated by the state in the past will be increased from 70 to 180, so that their income will increase by 32% compared with 1958, and each labor day can be divided into six tugriks, an increase of 20% compared with 1958. In addition, the cooperative will also carry out basic construction and run cultural and welfare undertakings. Many cooperatives have come out to accept this challenge of socialist competition.
    According to recent statistics, 6.1 million new young animals of various types have been added nationwide this year, with a survival rate of 95%. If there are no other unexpected disasters, the number of livestock in the People's Republic of Mongolia will be greatly increased after the cooperativization of animal husbandry this year.
    This year is the decisive year for the People's Republic of Mongolia to complete the Three-Year Plan. After summarizing Mongolia's great achievements in socialist reform in March this year, the Third Plenary Session of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party pointed out that Mongolia is currently building socialism along the path of comprehensively developing productive forces and consolidating socialist relations of production. According to the agreement signed between the Soviet Union and Mongolia in Moscow in February this year, Mongolia will reclaim a large amount of wasteland and build flour mills with the assistance of the great Soviet Union, and is expected to achieve self-sufficiency in flour by 1961. The vigorous development of agricultural production will help to establish feed bases and promote the settlement of herdsmen.
    In this period when the People's Republic of Mongolia is entering the stage of comprehensively carrying out socialist construction, all the working people of Mongolia are more closely united around their own Party and government, and are further launching a socialist labor production upsurge in order to complete and overfulfill the Three-Year Plan. The completion of the tasks of the Three-Year Plan will lay a solid foundation for the material and technical strength of Mongolia's socialist construction. It will not only greatly inspire the confidence of the Mongolian working people in building socialism, but also further strengthen the strength of the socialist camp and make due contributions to the common prosperity of socialist countries.

    蒙古牧业合作化的辉煌胜利
    中国驻蒙古人民共和国大使　谢甫生
    我国的亲密的邻邦——蒙古人民共和国，是一个土地辽阔、物产富饶、山河壮丽的国家。三十八年来，蒙古在蒙古人民革命党领导下取得了巨大的成就，已从单纯的牧业国发展成为正在建设现代经济和文化的农牧业工业国。蒙古全国土地的88.2％是草原，人口的70％从事畜牧业。以全国人口计算，平均每人可得二十七头牲畜，占世界第一位。畜产品除供应人民日常衣食外，还占出口品的绝大部分。蒙古大多数工业产品以畜产品作原料，国家预算收入的主要部分也是来自畜牧业。这一切说明，畜牧业的发展对提高蒙古人民的物质和文化生活水平，对发展蒙古的社会主义建设都具有重大意义。
    蒙古人民革命党和政府历来就重视发展畜牧业，把畜牧业看做是国民经济的基本部门，而其他部门的发展以及经济文化建设的速度，在很大程度上以畜牧业的状况为转移。三十八年来，蒙古人民在党和政府的领导下，克服了旧制度遗留下来的落后贫困状态，改变了牧业生产上的生产关系，采取了一系列措施来增殖牲畜头数，提高畜产品产量，大大提高了牧民的生产情绪。现在，蒙古牲畜头数已比革命初期增加了一点五倍。
    使畜牧业得到巨大发展，保证牧民过富裕生活的正确道路，是通过畜牧业合作化来进入社会主义。近几年来，由于党和政府的正确政策以及牧民政治觉悟的提高，特别是由于第二个五年计划（1953—1957年）期间在畜牧业中所采取的措施，令人信服地说明合作经济的优越性，因而大大加快了合作化的发展速度。为了加强对合作社的领导，1953年蒙古人民革命党中央全会通过了关于“在组织上和经济上巩固牧民生产合作社的决议”。1955年召开了牧民生产合作社先进工作者代表大会，通过了合作社的示范章程，规定了社员的劳动定额，贯彻了按劳分配制度，进一步在组织上巩固了合作社。党和政府在这期间还为合作社培养了干部，增设了割草站为合作社服务。由于这些努力，蒙古畜牧业的社会主义成分在第二个五年计划期间发展成为巨大的力量。1952年参加合作社的牧户占5％，1957年增加至35％，参加合作社的牲畜也由五十万头增至九百四十万头。
    1958年3月，蒙古人民革命党第十三次代表大会通过的新的三年计划，大大鼓舞了蒙古劳动人民的生产热忱和政治积极性。劳动牧民为响应党的第十三次代表大会的号召而加入合作社的运动蓬勃发展起来。尤其是从1958年11月蒙古人民革命党二中全会以后，在党的领导下，牧业合作化有了飞跃的发展，这在蒙古各项社会主义建设事业中显得十分突出。二中全会时入社牧户占56％，至今年1月底已发展至87％。根据蒙古国家统计局公报，今年4月份入社户已达97.7％。蒙古畜牧业合作化工作基本上完成了。
    这个成就是人民革命党领导下的蒙古人民在畜牧业合作化方面取得的辉煌胜利。由于同时结束了对残余的私营手工业和私营商业的合作化工作，从而在城市和乡村消灭了个体经营的经济，以社会主义所有制的两种形式——国有和合作社有为基础的统一的社会主义体系的经济，在蒙古国民经济中占绝对优势地位。随着社会经济的巨大变革，蒙古的牧民已成为社会主义的新阶级。以工人阶级为领导的工人和牧民的联盟正在进一步巩固着。
    在加速畜牧业合作化的过程中，党和政府给予了合作社以巨大支持。今年1月间，党中央发出号召，要求机关干部到合作社工作，增强合作社的领导力量。不少中央副部长和省的领导同志以及广大的机关干部响应了这一号召，仅在乌兰巴托一地就有五百多名干部报名。中央高级党校为此增设了培养合作社干部的短期训练班，党中央和部长会议特为这批参加合作社工作的干部作出决议。毫无疑问，这对于合作社的巩固和发展起着极为巨大的作用。
    此外，党和政府还在财政物质上予以帮助，1959年贷给合作社的贷款比1958年增加五百万图格里克（蒙币），并且规定如不足用还可以增加。今年第一季度发给合作社的贷款比去年同期就增加了55.3％。1959年国家在农牧业上的投资额比1958年的预算执行额增加32％，其中用于兽医、畜产技术措施，牲畜品种的改良，建立饲料基地和打井等方面的财政开支都比1958年的预算执行额有所增加。最近大人民呼拉尔主席团取消了建筑税和地基税，对合作社的定居给予了很大方便。
    随着分散的个体经济的消灭，为适应分散个体经济而建立的国家的基层行政机构已完成了它的历史使命，因而在更加接近劳动人民和生产的基础上，改革行政机构和合并合作社的工作同时进行。以前分布在二千五百多个乡的牧民加入合作社后，分别组成了生产队和生产组，因而乡的继续存在也就没有必要了，实践证明县的领导和合作社领导的合一是正确的。县和社合一后，全国共有四百二十六个县——合作社。撤消乡一级机构的结果，每年为国家节省行政费用三百多万图格里克。县和合作社的合一不仅可以加强合作社的领导，改进国家机构的工作，节约开支，而且可能使更多的人参加合作社的生产，组织较大的生产建设活动，更广泛地利用现代机器和先进技术，促使牧民定居和增加牲畜头数，更迅速地促进农牧业的社会主义建设。
    牧业合作化和县社合一以后，牧民的生产情绪迅速高涨。如在1958年超额完成各项生产计划的科布多省“阿尔太峰”合作社，在今年5月间向全国合作社发出挑战书，受到全体社员的热烈欢迎。为了以更高的劳动成就迎接今年第四季度召开的第二次合作社代表大会，这个合作社又提出了新的1959年的计划，向全国合作社和社员挑战。这个计划规定：1959年牲畜将增加20.3％；在产牛奶和剪羊毛方面将提前完成三年计划；有劳动力的社员参加社的劳动，由过去国家规定的七十个劳动日增加至一百八十个劳动日，使他们的收入比1958年增加32％，每个劳动日可分得六个图格里克，较1958年增20％。此外，合作社还将进行基本建设和兴办文化福利事业。对于这个社会主义竞赛的挑战，已有不少合作社出来应战。
    根据最近统计，今年全国新增各种幼畜六百一十万头，成活率达95％。如无其他意外灾害，今年蒙古人民共和国的牲畜头数将在牧业合作化后得到巨大的增加。
    今年是蒙古人民共和国完成三年计划的决定性的一年。今年3月蒙古人民革命党三中全会概括了蒙古在社会主义改革方面的巨大成就之后，指出蒙古目前正沿着全面发展生产力和巩固社会主义生产关系的途径建设社会主义。根据今年2月苏蒙两国在莫斯科签订的协定，蒙古在伟大的苏联援助下，将大量开垦荒地，建设面粉厂，预期到1961年将可做到面粉自给。农业生产的大力发展，必将有助于建立饲料基地和促使牧民定居。
    在蒙古人民共和国进入全面开展社会主义建设的这个时期，蒙古全体劳动人民更加紧密地团结在自己的党和政府的周围，为完成和超额完成三年计划，进一步掀起社会主义劳动生产热潮。而三年计划任务的完成，将为蒙古社会主义建设的物质技术力量打下雄厚的基础。它不仅将极大地鼓舞蒙古劳动人民建成社会主义的信心，同时也将进一步增强社会主义阵营的力量，为社会主义各国的共同繁荣作出应有的贡献。
