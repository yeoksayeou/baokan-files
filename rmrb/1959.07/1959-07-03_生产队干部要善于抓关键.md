    Production Team Cadres Should Be Good at Grasping the Key
    Han Wenhui
    The cadres at the production team level of the people's commune are the frontline commanders on the agricultural production front. The quality of their working methods directly affects whether various policies and production technology measures can be implemented. In agricultural production, every production task has an urgent seasonality. Often, many farm works are intertwined. If the team cadres arrange them well, they can overcome the difficulty of insufficient labor force. If the leadership is not good, even if the original labor force is generally sufficient, it will be insufficient due to idleness and waste, making it impossible for various crops to be carried out according to the farming season.
    The leadership work of grassroots units of the commune has many aspects; the most important of which is to be good at grasping the key. The Wuxing Production Team of the Wuxing People's Commune in Turpan County, with the help of Comrade Wang Enmao, has gained some experience in this regard. Before they improved their leadership methods, all kinds of farm work were carried out simultaneously, regardless of urgency, and the work was always passive. For example, cotton field management in early June was the most important task of this team, and the key to cotton field management was topdressing and watering. However, at that time, the team cadres did not grasp this main link, but proposed to weed and loosen the soil three times before topdressing and watering. Although weeding three times is beneficial to retaining moisture in the cotton fields, it was still secondary compared to topdressing and watering at that time. At that time, the cotton in the whole team was more than 50 days away from the sowing period and there were signs of drought. If it was not watered in time, the boll shedding would be serious. As for inter-tillage and weeding, it had already been cultivated once at that time. If it were to be carried out two or three times more, it would take more than ten days for more than two hundred laborers to weed 2,500 mu of cotton fields; this was not only unnecessary, but would also delay the topdressing and watering time by more than ten days. Later, they changed this practice and focused on the key work of cotton field management at that time, transferring the labor force to topdressing and watering, which not only ensured that the cotton topdressing and watering did not miss the farming season, but also eased the tension in the labor force accordingly.
    At any time, there are many farm works intertwined; however, at any time, there are key and general, urgent and slow farm works. The cadres who lead production must be good at grasping the key of the work at any time, identifying the primary and secondary, weighing the importance, considering the urgency, and then rationally arranging the labor force. After properly arranging the labor force, it is also necessary to keep the organization work up to date and find the key to improving work efficiency from it.
    How can the team cadres be able to grasp the key in production at any time? In addition to improving the sense of responsibility, the most important thing is to participate in production in a down-to-earth manner. What to do first, what to do later, how much labor is needed, and how much time is needed must be calculated in detail and arranged specifically. Only by participating in production personally can we discover which are the key and which are not the key; where are the problems and where are the experiences. The cadres of the commune and the management area should also often go deep into the team to help the team cadres do a good job in leading production in a down-to-earth manner. If the leadership work at the team level is done well, there will be a reliable guarantee for completing various tasks.

    生产队干部要善于抓关键
    韩文慧
    人民公社生产队一级的干部，是农业生产战线上最前线的指挥员。他们的工作方法的好坏，直接关系着各项政策和生产技术措施能否贯彻执行。在农业生产上，每一项生产工作都有紧迫的季节性，往往有许多农活交错在一起，如果队的干部安排得好，就可以克服劳动力不足的困难。如果领导得不好，即或原来劳动力大体上够用，也会因窝工浪费而不够用，使各种作物不能按农时进行。
    公社基层单位的领导工作，有很多方面；其中最主要的是善于抓关键。吐鲁番县五星人民公社五星生产队在王恩茂同志的帮助下，在这方面摸到了一些经验。他们在改进领导方法以前，各项农活不分缓急，齐头并进，工作处处被动。例如棉田管理在6月上旬是这个队最主要的任务，棉田管理工作中的关键是追肥和浇水，但当时队干部没有抓住这个主要环节，却提出要锄草松土三次以后再追肥浇水。锄草三次对棉田保墒虽有一定好处，但当时和追肥、浇水比较起来，锄草松土还是次要的。当时全队棉花距离播种期已五十多天，并已出现旱象，如不及时浇水，将会严重落铃。至于中耕锄草，当时已中耕过一次，如再进行二次、三次，二百多个劳动力锄二千五百亩棉田，还得十余天时间；这不但必要性不大，而且得推延追肥、浇水时间十多天。后来，他们改变了这种作法，狠抓了当时棉田管理的关键工作，把劳动力调到追肥和浇水方面，既保证了棉花追肥、浇水不失农时，劳力紧张的情况也相应地缓和了。
    在任何时候都有许多农活交错在一起；可是，任何时候各种农活中也有关键的和一般的，有缓有急。领导生产的干部必须善于随时抓工作中的关键，识别主次，衡量轻重，斟酌缓急，然后合理安排劳力。在妥善安排劳力之后，还要使组织工作跟上去，并从中找寻提高工效的关键。
    队的干部怎样才能作到随时抓住生产中的关键呢？除了提高责任感以外，顶要紧的是踏踏实实参加生产。先做什么，后做什么，需要多少劳动力，需要多少时间，都要项项详细计算，样样具体安排。只有亲身参加生产，才能发现哪些是关键，哪些不是关键；哪里有问题，哪里有经验。公社和管理区的干部，也应该经常深入到队里去，踏踏实实帮助队里的干部做好领导生产的工作。队一级的领导工作作好了，完成各项任务就有了可靠的保证。
