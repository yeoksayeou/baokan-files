Shanxi Province Closely Integrates Ideological Work with Production Campaigns
Competing in Redness, Diligence, and Skill Results in High Labor Productivity

(Our newspaper, Taiyuan, 5th dispatch) The labor emulation campaign of "competing in redness, diligence, and skill" launched in the rural areas of Shanxi Province is developing from the original basis of ensuring full attendance and high work efficiency towards striving to improve the economic effect of each workday.

The "Redness, Diligence, and Skill" labor emulation campaign in the rural areas of Shanxi Province was rapidly launched after the province established advanced banners such as Li Tianzhu, Zhang Jiangkao, Wang Dongguo, and Li Rui in March of this year. "Competing in redness" means that in the labor emulation, commune members should compete in communist consciousness, in work attitude, and in the quality of considering the interests of the state and the collective everywhere; "Competing in diligence" means competing in practical work, hard work, daily diligence, diligence in everything, diligence everywhere, making full use of every moment, and never walking empty-handed; "Competing in skill" means competing in skillfully improving tools and improving technology. The relationship between redness, diligence, and skill is to lead "diligence" with "redness" and promote "skill" with "diligence." Therefore, this is not only a production campaign but also an ideological campaign. This movement cleverly combines political and ideological work with production work in rural areas, becoming an effective method for developing rural productive forces in Shanxi Province today.

In the competition, various localities have adopted the leadership method of establishing pacesetters at each level and in each industry, using the points to lead the whole area. The evaluation time is seven days, ten days, or half a month. After the evaluation, the commune members who are good in all aspects of "redness, diligence, and skill" are given certain material rewards in addition to the title of "Redness, Diligence, and Skill Commune Member." Now, 400,000 commune members and cadres in the province have won this title. Collective units have also launched "redness, diligence, and skill" evaluation competitions. Now, more than 20,000 "Redness, Diligence, and Skill Production Teams" and "Redness, Diligence, and Skill Work Groups" have emerged in the province.

The development of the "Redness, Diligence, and Skill" movement has played a significant role in solving the current labor shortage in the rural areas of Shanxi Province. Since the launch of the movement, the labor attendance rate in the rural areas of the province has generally increased from 70% in the past to more than 95%. The number of people absent from work without reason has been greatly reduced, and the practice of making full use of every moment, never walking empty-handed, and carrying out work while going to and from the fields has become a common practice among the broad masses of commune members.

Labor efficiency has generally improved. Many commune members, production teams, and work groups have broken through the old labor quotas and created new records. According to a survey of five communes in northern Shanxi, labor efficiency has generally increased by 20% to 30%, and some advanced production units have increased by about 50% or even doubled. In five communes and five management areas in northern Shanxi, there are a total of 1,325 laborers. In the various spring plowing and sowing agricultural tasks, 351 people have broken through the labor quota, averaging 20% to 50% above the quota standard.

The tool reform movement has greatly developed in the "Redness, Diligence, and Skill" movement. In many places, everyone learns technology and everyone improves tools, creating a new situation of technological innovation. Since the spring, more than 830,000 tools have been repaired and reformed throughout the province.

The "Redness, Diligence, and Skill" movement has also promoted a more rational use of labor and the production process. In the past, only 40% of the production teams in the province conscientiously implemented small-section operation plans. After the launch of the movement, 90% of the production teams conscientiously implemented the small-section operation plans. All of this has not only ensured that Shanxi Province completed the spring sowing task in a timely manner this year under the condition of a severe shortage of labor, but also pushed summer production a step forward.

In order to enable the "Redness, Diligence, and Skill" movement to continue to develop healthily, the Rural Work Department of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a symposium on the "Redness, Diligence, and Skill" movement with the participation of relevant personnel from various counties. The meeting determined that the "Redness, Diligence, and Skill" movement should be based on the principle of combining political command with material incentives, combining work and rest, and combining skill and management (skillful work and improved management). On the basis of ensuring full attendance and high work efficiency in the past, the movement should be guided towards the direction of everyone caring about quality, everyone caring about management, and striving to improve the economic effect of each workday, so as to ensure that one more day of work today will result in one more point of grain in the autumn harvest.

Yanggao County, where the "Redness, Diligence, and Skill" movement has been carried out well, has changed the "three highs" slogan of high attendance, high efficiency, and high quality in the past competition to "five highs" (adding high yield and increased income for commune members) based on the spirit of this meeting. Qin County is currently focusing on three major tasks in the current movement: First, focusing on "redness" taking command, organizing party members and cadres to further conscientiously study the instructions of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China on the "Redness, Diligence, and Skill" movement, summarize the achievements and shortcomings of the past movement, and improve ideological understanding to meet the new high tide of the movement; Second, focusing on rationalizing the production process, organizing the masses to speak out freely, expose the phenomenon of wasted labor since this year, improve the quality of small-section operation plans, and ensure that every workday can be used where production is most needed; Third, focusing on the production of iron and wood industries throughout the county, mobilizing commune members throughout the county to equip themselves with five handy and commonly used farm tools to improve labor efficiency.

    山西省把思想工作和生产运动紧密结合起来
    赛红赛勤赛巧　劳动生产效率高
    本报太原5日电　山西省农村开展的赛红、赛勤、赛巧的劳动竞赛运动，正在原来保全勤、高工效的基础上，向力争提高每个劳动日的经济效果的方向发展。
    山西省农村的“红、勤、巧”劳动竞赛运动，是今年3月全省树立起李天柱、张江考、王东果、李锐等先进旗帜以后，迅速开展起来的。所谓“赛红”，就是社员在劳动竞赛中要比共产主义觉悟，比劳动态度，比处处为国家为集体利益打算的品质；“赛勤”，就是比实干、苦干，比日日勤、事事勤、处处勤、时不空过、路不空行；“赛巧”，就是比巧改工具，比提高技术。红、勤、巧三者之间的关系，是以“红”带“勤”，以“勤”促“巧”。因此这既是一个生产运动，也是一个思想运动，这个运动巧妙地把农村中的政治思想工作和生产工作密切结合起来，成为山西省当前发展农村生产力的有效方法。
    在竞赛中，各地采取了层层行行立标兵，以点带面的领导方法。评比时间有七天的、也有十天半月的。经过评比，“红、勤、巧”全面好的社员，除给予一定的物质奖励，还给予“红勤巧社员”的称号。现在全省已有四十万社员和干部获得了这个称号。集体单位之间也开展了“红、勤、巧”的评比竞赛，现在全省已出现了两万多个“红勤巧生产队”和“红勤巧作业小组”。
    开展“红、勤、巧”运动，对解决山西省农村当前劳动力不足起了很大作用。全省农村自开展运动以来，劳动出勤率普遍由过去的70％提高到95％以上。无故旷工的人大大减少，时不空过、路不空行，上地来回捎带干活，在广大社员中形成了风气。
    劳动效率普遍提高。不少社员和生产队、作业组突破了旧的劳动定额，创造了新纪录。据晋北五个公社的调查，劳动效率一般提高了20％到30％，某些先进的生产单位提高了50％左右以至一倍。晋北五个公社五个管理区，共有劳动力一千三百二十五人，在春耕播种各项农活中，突破劳动定额的有三百五十一人，平均超过定额标准20％到50％。
    工具改革运动在“红、勤、巧”运动中有很大发展。许多地方人人学技术、个个改工具，出现了一个技术革新的新局面。春季以来，全省共整修和改革工具八十三万多件。
    “红、勤、巧”运动也促进了使用劳动力和生产过程更加合理化。过去全省只有40％的生产队认真执行小段作业计划，开展运动以后，有90％的生产队都认真执行了小段作业计划。这一切不仅保证了今年山西省在劳力严重不足的情况下，适时完成了春播任务，而且使夏季生产也赶前了一步。
    为了使“红、勤、巧”运动继续健康地向前发展，中共山西省委农村工作部最近召开了各县有关人员参加的“红、勤、巧”运动座谈会。会上确定：“红、勤、巧”运动今后应该以政治挂帅与物质鼓励相结合，劳与逸相结合，巧与管相结合
  （巧干和改善管理）的原则下，在过去保全勤、高工效的基础上，把运动引向人人关心质量，人人关心管理，力争提高每个劳动日的经济效果的方向发展，以确保今日多干一天活，秋后多收一分粮。
    “红、勤、巧”运动开展得较好的阳高县，根据这次会议的精神，现在已经把过去竞赛中的高勤、高效、高质的“三高”口号，改为“五高”（加上高产量和社员提高收入）。沁县在当前运动中正在抓三件大事：一抓“红”字挂帅，组织党员、干部进一步认真学习中共山西省委有关“红、勤、巧”运动的指示，总结过去运动的成绩和缺点，提高思想认识，迎接新的运动高潮；二抓生产过程合理化，组织群众大鸣大放，揭发今年以来浪费劳力的现象，提高小段作业计划的质量，把每个劳动日都能用在生产最需要的地方；三抓全县铁木业生产，发动全县社员每人装备五件得心应手的常用农具，提高劳动效率。
