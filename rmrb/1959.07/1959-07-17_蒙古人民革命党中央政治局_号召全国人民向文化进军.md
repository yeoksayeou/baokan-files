    Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party Central Committee
    Calls on the Whole Nation to March Towards Culture
    Three Basic Requirements:
    Everyone Pays Attention to Maintaining Hygiene
    Everyone Strives to Study Culture
    Everyone Obeys Public Morality
    Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, July 15th: The Mongolian "Truth" newspaper today published the resolution of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party on launching a nationwide cultural advance. The resolution calls for raising Mongolia's socialist culture, which has already made great progress, to a new stage in order to welcome the 40th anniversary of the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution (July 11, 1961).
    The resolution puts forward three basic requirements for the cultural advance in the next two years as the first step in realizing the task of the cultural revolution.
    These three requirements are: everyone should pay attention to maintaining personal hygiene and environmental sanitation, everyone should improve upon their existing education, everyone should strictly abide by public morals, maintain social order, and resolutely fight against bad habits such as drunkenness.
    The resolution points out that in order to carry out socialist construction in Mongolia, it is necessary not only to establish a socialist material and technical base, but also to require all members of society to have political awareness and a high level of culture. The current situation urgently requires carrying out a socialist cultural revolution throughout the country, eradicating the backward remnants remaining in people's ideology, raising socialist consciousness, and giving full play to the political enthusiasm and labor enthusiasm of the masses.
    The resolution states that the main tasks of the socialist cultural revolution are: to enable all people of appropriate age to reach the cultural level of general education, to cultivate hygienic habits in people's lives, to eliminate diseases that are most harmful to the human body, to resolutely raise the communist consciousness of the working people, to reform backward customs and habits, to promote patriotism, collectivism, and internationalism, to develop sports, to improve the work of schools and scientific research institutions at all levels, to strive to closely connect with reality, and to develop mass cultural work.
    The resolution instructs Party and government organizations and mass organizations at all levels to widely carry out propaganda activities for the cultural advance.
