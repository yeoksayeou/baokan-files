Glossary of Terms
    Measurement, Measurement Work
    In daily life, we cannot do without counting and measuring. For example, we use a ruler to measure the length of cloth, scales to weigh or use bushels to measure the quantity of grain, water meters to calculate the amount of water used, electricity meters to calculate the amount of electrical energy used, and clocks and watches to measure time, and so on. Length, weight, water volume, electrical energy, time, etc., are all quantities. The process of determining the amount of these various quantities is called measurement. When measuring, it is necessary to use various measuring instruments such as rulers, scales, bushels, water meters, electricity meters, clocks, etc. To ensure the accuracy and consistency of all measuring instruments used in daily life, scientific research, and various sectors of the national economy, and their correct use, a series of work is required, which is called measurement work.
    The most common measuring instruments encountered in daily life are rulers, bushels, scales, etc., used to measure length, weight, and capacity.
    Nautical Mile
      The "nautical mile" is a specialized unit of measurement used to measure distances at sea. It is based on the length of one minute of latitude on the Earth's meridian. However, because the Earth is not a perfect sphere but slightly oblate, the length of one minute of latitude varies depending on the latitude. The nautical mile as defined by many countries differs slightly in length because the latitude chosen as the standard is different. For example, when converted to the metric system, the British nautical mile is 1.853184 kilometers, the American is 1.853249 kilometers, the French is 1.852 kilometers, and the German is 1.855 kilometers. The International Hydrographic Bureau conference in 1929 adopted a value of 1.852 kilometers, calculated based on the average length of one minute of latitude. The Soviet Union adopted this value.
    International Metric System
    In the late 18th century, France pioneered a system of measurement, using the most stable and unchanging natural object—the length of the Earth's meridian—as the standard. Through actual measurement, one forty-millionth of the Paris meridian was defined as the unit of length, named the meter. The unit of capacity was called the "liter," equal to one-tenth of a meter cubed. The unit of mass was the gram, equal to the mass of one cubic centimeter of pure water at four degrees Celsius. This system was called the metric system, now called the International Metric System in our country. Its units are all based on multiples of ten, which is very convenient. Since its creation, it has gradually been adopted by some countries.
    In 1875, representatives from seventeen countries, including Russia, Germany, Britain, France, the United States, Japan, and Italy, signed the Meter Convention in Paris, recognizing the metric system as the internationally accepted system of measurement. The International Bureau of Weights and Measures and the International Committee for Weights and Measures were established, and platinum-iridium alloy meter bars and kilogram weights were manufactured as the international prototypes for length and mass, respectively, and kept in the International Bureau of Weights and Measures as the international standards for length and mass in the metric system.
    The definitions of several metric units originally defined by France were later precisely verified against the actual objects of the meter and kilogram international prototypes, and it was found that the actual values of the prototypes did not match the theoretical values. Therefore, the definitions of several main units of the metric system were redefined as follows:
    1. [Meter]: The unit of length, which is the distance between the two marks on the platinum-iridium international meter prototype kept in the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Paris at the ice melting temperature.
    2. "Kilogram": The unit of mass, which is the mass of the platinum-iridium international kilogram prototype kept in the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Paris.
    3. "Liter": The unit of capacity, which is the volume of one kilogram of pure water at its maximum density under standard atmospheric pressure.
    One liter equals 1.000028 cubic decimeters.
    Today, the vast majority of countries in the world have adopted the metric system, some as the only dedicated system, and some used in conjunction with their own national systems. Therefore, we call this system the International Metric System.

Questions and Answers
    Why Not Change Traditional Chinese Medicine Prescriptions to Use the Ten-Tael-Per-Jin Market System?
    After the market system was changed to ten taels per jin, because the jin remained the same, the units below the jin, such as taels, qian, and fen, all became larger. One tael after the change is equal to one tael and six qian in the original system. The units used in traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions are precisely these units. The difference between the new and old units is very large. A slight oversight could affect people's health. If it is a highly toxic drug, too much of it could have serious consequences. To avoid errors, traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions do not need to be changed. For areas that originally used other old mixed systems, the old system can also be continued for the same reason.
    If the Market Jin is Changed to a Ten-Tael System, Does the Size of the Jin Change?
    If one market jin is changed to ten taels, the size of the market jin does not change, only the tael becomes larger. After changing to ten taels, one tael is equal to one tael and six qian in the original system. When the tael becomes larger, the qian, fen, and other units below the tael also become larger.
      Are Land Mu Changed?
    Our country uses two types of market mu for calculating land area: the Northeast mu and the Guannei mu. The Northeast mu is equal to 9,000 square meters, and the Guannei mu is equal to 6,000 square meters. To further unify our country's measurement system with the International Metric System, in addition to using metric land area units, should we uniformly adopt one of the above two market land area units? If we adopt one, then adopting the Northeast mu would be more reasonable, because ten Northeast mu are equal to one hectare, which is easy to convert. However, the Guannei mu has been used for a long time, and a sudden change would be inconvenient for the general public. The status quo can be maintained for now, and both the Northeast mu and the Guannei mu can continue to be used.

    名词解释
    计量，计量工作
    在日常生活中，离不开计数和度量。例如：用尺来量布匹的长短、用秤来称或用升斗来量粮食的数量、用水表来计算使用的水量、用电表来计算使用的电能量、用钟表来计时等等。长短、轻重、水量、电能量、时间等，都是一种量，确定各种量的多少这一过程，就叫计量。当进行计量时，必须利用像尺、秤、升、斗、水表、电表、钟表之类的各种各样的计量器具，为了保证日常生活、科学研究以及国民经济各部门中一切使用的计量器具的准确一致和正确使用，所需进行的一系列工作，就叫计量工作。
    日常生活中最常遇到的计量器具是尺、斗、秤之类，用以计量、长度、重量和容量。
    海里（浬）
      “海里（浬）”是在海洋中测量距离时一种专用的计量单位，它是按地球子午线上的纬度一分的长度作为根据，但是由于地球不是一个正圆球，而略呈扁球状，所以同为纬度一分，在纬度位置不同的地点，长度就有所不同。许多国家所规定的一海里，因为所选择作为标准的纬度不一样，长度就稍有出入，如折合公制计算英国为
  一点八五三一八四公里、美国为一点八五三二四九公里、法国为一点八五二公里、德国为一点八五五公里，一九二九年国际水文地理学会议通过按纬度一分的平均长度计算折合为一点八五二公里，苏联就采用这一数值。
    国际公制
    在十八世纪末，由法国首创一种计量制度，采用最稳定而不变化的自然物——地球子午线的长度作为标准，通过实际测量，以巴黎的子午线的四千万分之一作为长度单位，定名为米突
  （米），容量单位叫米“立特”（公升），等于十分之一米的立方，质量单位叫克，等于摄氏四度时，一立方厘米纯水的质量，这一制度就称为米突制，现我国叫它为国际公制，它的大小单位，都是十进十退，非常方便，从创订以后，逐渐为一些国家采用。
    一八七五年，俄、德、英、法、美、日、意等十七个国家的代表在巴黎签定了米突公约，公认米突制为国际通用的计量制度，并成立国际权度委员会和国际权度局，制造出铂铱合金米突尺和公斤砝码，分别作为长度和质量的国际原器，保存于国际权度局内，作为米突制的长度和质量的国际标准。
    原由法国规定的几个米突制单位的定义，后来对照米突和公斤两种国际原器实物进行精密核验，发现原器的实际量值和理论上的数值不符，因此重新确定了米突制几个主单位的定义如下：
    一、〔米〕是长度单位，为保存于巴黎国际权度局内的铂铱米国际原器，在冰融温度时两标点间的距离。
    二、“公斤”是质量单位，为保存于巴黎国际权度局内的铂铱公斤国际原器的质量。
    三、“公升”是容量单位，为一公斤质量的纯水，在标准大气压下，最大密度时的体积。
    一公升等于一点○○○○二八立方分米
    现时世界上绝大多数国家，都采用了米突制，有的作为唯一专用的制度，有的和本国制度并用。所以我们叫这一制度为国际公制。问答
    为什么中医处方不改用
    十两一斤的市制？
    市制改为十两一斤后，由于斤不变，而斤以下的两、钱、分等单位都变大了。改制后的一两，等于原来的一两六钱，中医处方所应用的单位，正是这些单位，新旧两种单位相差很多，稍有疏忽，关系人民健康，如果是剧毒性药物，分量多了，很可能引起严重后果。为了避免发生差错，所以中医处方用药，可以不改。至于有原来使用其他旧杂制的地区，根据同一理由，也可同样沿用旧制。
    市斤改十两制，斤的大小是否变动？
    一市斤，改为十两，市斤的大小不变，只是将两变大了。改为十两后一两等于原来的一两六钱。两变大了，两以下的钱、分等单位也跟着变大了。
      地亩是否改变？
    我国计算地积用的市亩有东北的和关内的两种，东北亩等于九千平方公尺，关内亩等于六千平方公尺。我们要进一步以国际公制统一我国的计量制度，除用公制地积单位外，对上述两种市制地积单位是否统一采用一种？如果采用一种，则采用东北亩比较合理，因为东北亩十亩等于一公顷，便于折算。但关内的亩，使用已久，突然改变广大群众会感到不便，目前可以维持现状，东北亩、关内亩都可继续使用。
