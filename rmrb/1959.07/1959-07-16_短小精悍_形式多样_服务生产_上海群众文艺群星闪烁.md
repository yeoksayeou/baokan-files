The recent 1959 Shanghai mass art exchange performance is a microcosm of the blossoming of mass art. The programs selected from Shanghai's fourteen districts and seven industrial systems demonstrate that the vast numbers of mass art activists are adept at seizing upon various themes in real life, shaping characters and depicting plots to reflect the new face of the times from different angles, serving politics and production in a thorough and detailed manner. The "Father and Daughter Reunion" from the Luwan District Public Security Bureau depicts how the people's police spared no effort to find an address for a father and daughter who had been separated for over twenty years, allowing them to reunite.

The mass art policy of being small-scale, diverse, short, sharp, and serving politics and production is fully embodied in this exchange performance. The vast majority of the performances not only closely coordinated with political and production tasks, reflecting various central tasks, but also came in a variety of forms. This performance included music, dance, folk art, acrobatics, magic, Shanghai opera, Yue opera, Huai opera, Beijing opera, Xiju opera, potpourri opera, and more. Taking folk art as an example, it can be further divided into Beijing-style drum songs, wooden fish ballads, Pingtan storytelling, rhythmic storytelling, four-person crosstalk, and storytelling. The performance time of these programs is generally only a few minutes or a little over ten minutes. Some programs also have a unique artistic structure, displaying the infinite wisdom and rich creativity of the masses. The Shanghai Cement Factory's chorus, "We are Willing to be Cooks for Life," uses tableware as accompaniment and sings tunes such as Yangliuqing and Madengdiao. Because of the rich ideological content, these tunes, though old, sound very moving and fully express the joy of cooks in their ordinary labor.

Many programs, because they reflect stories from the actors' own lives, naturally imbue the roles they play with emotion, making the performances natural and filled with the breath of life. The faculty of Huai'an Road Primary School vividly expressed their experiences in educating mischievous children in the drama "An Application." The female workers of Chunyi Yarn Factory vividly depicted their spirit of catching up with and learning from the advanced, eliminating empty spindles, and cooperating with each other in the high-yield, high-quality movement through the "Yarn Spindle Snatching Dance."

    短小精悍　形式多样　服务生产
    上海群众文艺群星闪烁
    本报讯　上海市近日举行的1959年群众文艺交流演出，是群众文艺百花怒放的缩影。从上海市十四个区和七个产业系统选拔出的这些节目表明，广大群众文艺活动分子，已善于抓住现实生活中各种各样的题材，通过人物的塑造，情节的描绘，从不同角度来反映时代的新面貌，深入细致地为政治为生产服务。卢湾区公安分局的“父女团圆”描绘了人民警察怎样千方百计为二十多年走散的父女寻找住址，使得他们骨肉欢聚。
    小型多样，短小精悍，为政治、为生产服务的群众文艺方针，充分体现在这次交流演出中。演出的绝大部分节目，不但紧密配合了政治和生产任务，反映了各项中心工作，而且在形式上也是多种多样。这次演出的有音乐、舞蹈、曲艺、杂技、魔术、沪剧、越剧、淮剧、京剧、锡剧、什锦戏等等。以曲艺来说，又可分京韵大鼓、木鱼书、评弹、说唱、四人相声、评话等。这些节目一般的演出时间只有几分钟或十多分钟。有些节目在艺术结构上也别具风格，显示了群众无穷的智慧和丰富的创造性。上海水泥厂的合唱“我们愿做一辈子炊事员”，用食具作伴奏，唱杨柳青、马灯调等调子，由于有丰富的思想内容，因此这些调子虽是老调，听起来却非常动人，充分表达了炊事员在平凡劳动中欢乐的心情。
    不少节目，由于反映了演员亲身生活中的故事，演员的感情也就自然地渗透在所扮演的角色中，演来自然，生活气息也特别浓厚。淮安路小学教工把他们怎样教育顽皮儿童的事例，在话剧“一张申请书”中生动地表达出来。纯益纱厂的女工，将她们在高产优质运动中，赶先进，学先进，消灭空锭，相互协作的精神，通过“抢纱锭舞”描绘得相当动人。
