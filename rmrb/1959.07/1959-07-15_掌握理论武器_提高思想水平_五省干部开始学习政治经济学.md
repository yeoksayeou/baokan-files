Grasping Theoretical Weapons, Improve Ideological Level
Cadres in Five Provinces Begin Studying Political Economics

(Our dispatch) In order to improve the Marxist-Leninist theoretical level of the broad masses of cadres, grasp the laws of socialist economics, and better implement the Party's general line for socialist construction and various economic policies, the broad masses of cadres in Jiangxi, Guizhou, Hunan, Hubei, and Shanxi provinces have successively begun to study political economics since July. The textbook they are using is the third edition of the Soviet-published "Textbook of Political Economy." The provincial Party committees attach great importance to this study. The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee and the Nanchang Municipal Party Committee held standing committee meetings to conduct special research and discussions on this issue, and established central leading groups for theoretical study under the provincial and municipal party committees, led by the First Secretary. The Hubei Provincial Party Committee held a provincial telephone conference on July 8, attended by the First Secretaries and Propaganda Ministers of various regions, cities, and counties. At the meeting, Zeng Dun, the Minister of Propaganda of the Provincial Party Committee, conveyed the recent decision of the Provincial Party Committee on strengthening the political and theoretical education of cadres, demanding that all localities launch a province-wide study movement of political economics starting this month, creating a reading atmosphere among the broad masses of cadres.

Jiangxi made relatively thorough preparations for the study of political economics. The Propaganda Department of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee and the Party Committee of the Provincial Directly Subordinate Organs held several political economy study classes from the end of January to mid-May, training a group of part-time theory teachers and tutors. In late May, various units reorganized the ranks of part-time theory teachers and tutors based on their specific circumstances, and then established teaching and research offices, teaching and research groups, tutoring groups, or theoretical study committees to strengthen the leadership and tutoring of the study. The Nanchang Municipal Party Committee also divided more than 14,000 cadres in the city into 47 lecture districts, each with eight to ten fixed theory teachers, and each study group was equipped with a tutor, to fully exert the tutoring role of teachers and tutors in the study.

Regarding study time, all provinces have made appropriate arrangements, ensuring half a day of study time per week, and requiring everyone to squeeze in more spare time for study. In order to ensure the quality of learning for leading cadres, the Hunan Provincial Party Committee also plans to transfer leading cadres above the level of county party first secretary in batches for rotational off-the-job study. In terms of learning methods, emphasis is placed on self-study, combined with summarizing and checking work, so as to be both substantive and practical. The study plan drafted by the Propaganda Department of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee also particularly emphasized the need to read carefully. The plan pointed out that the entire system should be studied chapter by chapter from beginning to end through the three steps of preview, explanation, discussion, and review. The plan pointed out: The focus of the entire study is the socialist part, but the capitalist part cannot be completely ignored. Political economics is a rigorous science with a high degree of Party spirit. Its analysis of problems is closely linked, and without its system, it is impossible to deeply understand the socialist part and accurately obtain all its knowledge.

In order to ensure that the political economics course is well studied, Party committees at all levels in various provinces have stipulated some necessary systems, especially making strict regulations on study time, which must not be arbitrarily occupied. Some places also regard the quality of cadres' theoretical study as a criterion for assessing cadres. With the attention and support of Party committees at all levels, coupled with the high learning enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres, the theoretical study in these provinces is developing rapidly.

    掌握理论武器　提高思想水平
    五省干部开始学习政治经济学
    本报讯　为了提高广大干部的马克思列宁主义理论水平，掌握社会主义的经济规律，更好地贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线和各项经济政策，江西、贵州、湖南、湖北和山西等省广大干部自7月起先后开始学习政治经济学。他们所采用的课本是苏联出版的“政治经济学教科书”第三版。各省委都很重视这一学习。江西省委和南昌市委，召开了常务委员会议，对这一问题进行了专门研究和讨论，并分别成立了省委和市委理论学习中心领导小组，由第一书记亲自领导。湖北省委于7月8日召开了有各地、市、县委第一书记和宣传部长参加的全省电话会议，会议上由省委宣传部长曾惇传达了最近省委关于加强干部政治理论教育的决定。要求各地从本月份开始，开展一个全省规模的学习政治经济学的学习运动。在广大干部中造成读书风气。
    江西对政治经济学的学习，事先还作了比较充分的准备，中共江西省委宣传部和省直属机关党委于1月底到5月中旬，曾先后分别举办了数次政治经济学学习班，训练了一批兼职理论教员和辅导员。各单位在5月下旬又根据本单位的具体情况，对兼职理论教员和辅导员队伍进行了一次整顿，接着成立了教研室、教研组、辅导组，或理论学习委员会等组织，以加强学习的领导和辅导。南昌市委还把全市一万四千多名干部划分为四十七个讲区，每个讲区固定八个到十个理论教员，每个学习小组配有一个辅导员，以充分发挥教员和辅导员对学习的辅导作用。
    关于学习时间，各省也都作了妥当的安排，除保证每星期有半天的学习时间外，要求大家多挤些业余时间学习。湖南省委为了保证领导干部的学习质量，还计划分批抽调县委第一书记以上的领导干部，轮流离职学习。在学习方法上，强调以自学为主，结合总结和检查工作，作到虚实并举。中共山西省委宣传部所起草的学习计划中，还特别强调要认真读书。计划指出要通过预习、讲解、讨论复习三个步骤，从头到尾一章一章系统地进行学习。计划指出：整个学习的重点是社会主义部分，但也不能完全忽略资本主义部分。政治经济学是一门有高度党性的严密的科学，它对问题的分析是一环紧扣一环，离开了它的系统就无法深刻地理解社会主义部分，无法准确地获得其全部知识。
    为了保证把政治经济学课程学好，各省各级党委都规定了一些必要的制度。特别在学习时间上作了严格的规定，不得随意侵占。有的地方还把干部理论学习成绩的好坏，作为考核干部的一个标准。在各级党委的重视和支持下，加上广大干部高涨的学习热情，这些省的理论学习正在迅速开展。
