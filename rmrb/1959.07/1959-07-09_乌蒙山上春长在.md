Wumeng Mountain, truly magnificent! We entered the mountains and ascended the towering peaks. Looking into the distance, the mountains undulate, and the green sea stretches as far as the eye can see; looking closer, evergreen mountains stand straight into the blue sky, white clouds wander in the mountainside, azaleas and rhododendrons reflect the mountain red… The heart of the Wumeng Mountains is an important engineering section of the Fujian-Yunnan Railway. In the Tianshengqiao area, during the day, workers come and go like a weaving loom; at night, the lights twinkle like stars. The roaring sound of blasting mountains echoes day and night, shaking the valleys!

The railway construction project in Wumeng Mountain is vast in scale. Here, tunnels connect to tunnels, and beyond the tunnels are bridges. Cliffs, precipices, high mountains, and dangerous ridges are everywhere; the scenic spots are endless. When people come to admire the beautiful scenery in the future, will they think of the hardships the railway soldiers experienced while carving the landscape?

Last autumn, the railway engineering corps marched into Wumeng Mountain from the southeast coast. At that time, there was only a trestle bridge over Tianshengqiao. The construction of the railway and highway met a difficult hurdle: the Tiger's Mouth Mountain at the southern end of Tianshengqiao, a towering cliff more than a thousand meters high, stood imposingly, with no foothold. The cliff was so steep that even wild animals sometimes fell into the river when trying to cross it! That is why people call it "Tiger's Mouth." When the local people of the Yi ethnicity heard that the railway soldiers were going to split open Tiger's Mouth to build a road and railway, they were very surprised. An old Yi man advised, "Soldiers, take a detour. You can't build a road here. Tiger's Mouth will eat people!" However, a detour was not possible. The sooner Tiger's Mouth was opened, the sooner the entire project could begin. Platoon Leader Zhang Shengsheng organized the seven best Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members in the platoon to form a shock group and started to split open the natural barrier. They carefully surveyed the terrain of Tiger's Mouth and then hung a long rope from the top of the mountain, and then climbed up the cliff using this rope. Communist Party member He Qinxin was the first to climb onto Tiger's Mouth and hammered in the first steel drill; the brave warriors followed one after another, tied with ropes around their waists, stepping on planks, and drilling holes in the air on the cliff. The howling mountain wind swept over the warriors' heads, and the misty clouds floated under their feet. If they stumbled, tilted their bodies, or slipped, they would fall into the bottomless abyss. Suddenly, the rope of one soldier loosened, and he was about to fall. At this moment, Platoon Leader Zhang Shengsheng leaped forward and grabbed him, and both of them hung in the air. Other comrades stabilized them, and then they raised their hammers and continued to work! They used their skills to expand the natural spring and load it with explosives, detonating large, medium, and small blasts, finally opening a passage in Tiger's Mouth.

Fighting against nature, danger is always present, and the soldiers' hearts often open up to us in this "danger." Also in Tianshengqiao, because the cliffs were too high and steep, it was difficult to transport timber across the river to the bridge. It took more than twenty people a whole day to carry only a few logs. Deputy Combat Section Chief Lu Hualong and the soldiers jointly designed and erected an antenna to hoist timber directly from the river to the bridge using copper cables. The Kedu River is very turbulent, with reefs standing in the river, and the water swirls and impacts; from the water surface to the cliff, there are 500 meters of steep rock, without a single blade of grass. The soldiers threw the copper cable down, but it got stuck at about 200 meters. Young squad leader Huang Xin Song went down the cliff six times to explore and send copper cables and install pulleys before the antenna was erected. The first time he went down the cliff, it was raining, the river valley was foggy, and the rocks were particularly slippery. The comrades advised, "It's dangerous, let's do it another day!" Huang Xin Song said, "No, time waits for no one!" He tied the rope around his waist, and the winch turned, suspending him in the air above the river valley, and he worked surrounded by clouds and mist. Unexpectedly, after the work was completed, when the winch was winding him back, it got stuck halfway under a protruding rock and could not be moved no matter what. The situation was critical; if the winch continued to wind, the rope would break. The comrades on the cliff heard Huang Xin Song's shouts but could not see him; Lu Hualong went around to the side of the cliff and saw Huang Xin Song struggling in the air, his limbs unsupported, but he could not hear his shouts. Everyone sweated for Huang Xin Song: he had been working on the cliff all day, how long could he hold on hanging in the air like that! Suddenly, everyone saw him lunge, grab a crack in the rock, and flip himself onto the rock. He simply untied the rope and, under Lu Hualong's signal guidance—he couldn't see the rocks above his head—climbed straight up the cliff empty-handed.

When they first arrived, many comrades camped in the mountains at night and went into the forest to cut trees during the day, accompanied by the howls of wild animals. Because of transportation difficulties, they often couldn't get vegetables and oil. Even more difficult was water. One comrade who had just arrived at the construction site saw the smoke and dust in the Lion's Mouth tunnel and asked: Why don't you use water-powered drills! But, heaven, where do you find water! Even the drinking water has to be rationed by the ounce! However, the soldiers' labor enthusiasm added such magnificent colors to this arduous life! Spring passed and summer came, and many slopes on Wumeng Mountain, barren land, were opened up into fields, planted with spinach, peppers, and lettuce. The soldiers swept their residences clean, and some houses were even planted with flowers and plants in front of their doors; after work, the soldiers changed into neat military uniforms and engaged in study and games. On Sundays, the comrades also climbed mountains and ridges and ran races on the rugged roads for labor-defense training. The mountains are even more lively at night. After returning from work, soldiers and laborers, young men and girls, gathered around bonfires, singing and dancing to their heart's content, their songs filling the valleys. This is a unique evening party, with the voices of more than a dozen ethnic groups—Yi, Hani, Kawa, and Han—singing about their labor and life; Guozhuang, Jumping Moon, Flower Lantern, antiphonal mountain songs… colorful and diverse.

People often say that Yunnan is like spring all year round, but this is not entirely true. In Wumeng Mountain, you have to put on cotton clothes even in June when it rains. But, on the other hand, in Wumeng Mountain, I also saw a spring that never withers, it is in the hearts of our officers and soldiers! The hard life has tempered their fighting spirit, and they are always working with energy and perseverance. It was so in the past, it is so now, and it will be so in the future. This is the true evergreen spring!

    乌蒙山上春长在
    朱振声
    乌蒙山，真是气势磅礴！我们走进大山，登上挺拔的山峰。远眺，山峦起伏，绿海望不见边；近望，一座座四季长青的高山直插蓝天，白云在山腰里游荡，河水在山脚下拍打，杜鹃花儿映山红……乌蒙山岳的中心，是闽滇大铁路重要的工程地段。其中的天生桥一带，白天，劳动的人们往来如织，夜晚，灯火闪烁宛如点点繁星。轰轰隆隆的开山炮声，日夜轰鸣，摇山震谷！
    乌蒙山里铁路建设工程规模浩大。这儿，隧道接连隧道，出了隧道就是大桥。悬崖、峭壁、高山、险岭，四处都是；风景名胜，描绘不尽。人们将来欣赏美景时，是否会想到铁道兵在雕刻河山时所经历的艰难呢！
    去年深秋，铁道兵部队从东南海边开进乌蒙山。那时，天生桥上只有一条栈道，修筑铁路公路遇见了难关：天生桥南端的老虎嘴山，一千多公尺高的悬岩峭壁巍然挺立，没有立脚处。山崖陡到这样程度：野兽越过也曾摔到河里！所以人们叫它作“老虎嘴”。当地群众听说铁道兵要劈开老虎嘴，修建公路铁路，十分惊讶。一位彝族老大爷劝说道：“大军，你绕个道吧，这里修不得路，老虎嘴要吃人的啊！”但是，道是不能绕的。“老虎嘴”早一天劈开，整个工程才能早一天动工。排长张胜生把排里七个最优秀的共产党员和共青团员组织起来，成立突击组，动手劈开天险。他们仔细侦察了老虎嘴地形，然后从山尖上吊下一根长绳，再从这根长绳爬上悬崖。共产党员何勤心第一个攀到老虎嘴上，打下第一根钢钎；勇士们相继跟上，腰拴绳索，脚踏跳板，在峭壁上悬空打眼放炮。呼啸的山风在勇士们头顶掠过，弥漫的云雾在勇士们脚下飘游。只要稍一失足，身体一倾或者脚下一滑，便会落进低头不见底的深渊。突然，有个战士拴的绳子一松，眼看便要摔下来。这时，排长张胜生猛地一纵，跳过来一把将他抓着，两个人便都悬在半空。别的同志将他们扶定，大家便又抡起铁锤继续干下去！他们运用技巧，把天然泉眼扩大装进炸药，大中小炮一齐施放，终于在老虎嘴里打开一条通途。
    向自然开战，惊险时时有，战士的胸怀，也常在这“惊险”时向我们敞开。也是在天生桥，因为山崖太高太陡，可渡河里木料运到桥上，二十多个人一天才能扛几根。作战股副股长卢化龙和战士们共同设计架设一道天线，用铜索把木材从河里直接吊到桥上。可渡河水很凶猛，河中礁石砥立，水流旋回撞击；从水面到崖上，五百公尺笔陡的岩石，寸草不生。战士们把铜索抛下去，铜索下到两百公尺左右被卡着了。年轻的班长黄信松六次下崖探险，送铜索，架滑轮，才架起天线。他第一次下崖，天下雨，河谷雾气重重，岩石分外滑腻，同志们劝道：“危险啊，改天干吧！”黄信松说：“不行，时间不等人！”他把绞索拴在腰上，绞盘滑转，将他悬空吊下河谷，他就在云雾包围中进行工作。不料，工作完了，绞盘把他往回绞时，绞到半途，人卡在凸起的岩石下，怎么也绞不动。情况危急，绞索再绞要断了。崖上的同志听见黄信松的喊叫，却看不见人影；卢化龙绕到崖侧，看见黄信松四肢不着地，吊在空中挣扎，可又听不见他的喊声。大家都为黄信松捏一把汗：他已经在绝壁上工作了一天，这样飘在空中，还能支持多久呢！忽然，大家便看到他猛一纵身，抓着石缝，翻身爬到了岩石上，干脆解开绳索，在卢化龙的信号指挥下——他自己望不见头上岩石，径直空手爬上悬崖。
    刚来，许多同志夜间露宿山野，白天进林伐木，陪伴他们的是野兽的啼啸。因为运输困难的缘故，吃不到菜和油，是常有的事。更困难的是水。一位刚到工地的同志，看到狮子口隧道里烟粉弥漫，问：你们为啥不用水风枪呢！可是，天啊，你往那里找水！大家连喝的水，也得论两计算哩！然而，战士们的劳动热情，又为这艰苦的生活抹上了多么瑰丽的色彩啊！春去夏来，乌蒙山的许多山坡，荒地上开出了块块园田，种上了菠菜、辣椒、莴笋。战士们把驻地四周打扫得干干净净，一些房屋门前还栽植了花草；战士们下了工，就换上整洁的军服，进行学习和游戏活动。星期天，同志们还爬山越岭，在崎岖的公路上赛跑，进行劳卫制锻炼。晚上，山里更是热闹，战士、民工劳动归来，小伙子们和姑娘们围着团团篝火，纵情跳舞唱歌，歌声填满山谷。这是别致的晚会，十多个民族——彝族的、哈尼族的、佧佤族和汉族的声音，歌唱着自己的劳动的生活；锅庄、跳月、花灯、山歌对唱……五彩缤纷。
    人们常说云南四季如春，这话并不完全。乌蒙山里，六月天下阵雨也要披上棉衣。但是，从另一方面来说，我在乌蒙山却也看到了永不雕谢的春天，它在我们的指战员们的心里！艰苦的生活磨炼了他们斗争的锐气，他们永远都精力充沛地、顽强不息地在工作着。过去如此，现在如此，将来也会如此。这才是真正的四季长春！
