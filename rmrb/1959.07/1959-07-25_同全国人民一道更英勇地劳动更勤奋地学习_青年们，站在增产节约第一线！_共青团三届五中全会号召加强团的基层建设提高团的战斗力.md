Xinhua News Agency, July 24th -- Communiqu√© of the Fifth Plenary Session of The Third Committee of the Communist Youth League
    The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China held its Fifth Plenary Session of the Third Committee in Qingdao, Shandong Province, from July 13th to 18th.

    The meeting listened to the work report made by Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, on behalf of the Standing Committee, focusing on discussing how to further mobilize the enthusiasm of young people across the country, actively participate in the movement to increase production and practice economy, strengthen the construction of grassroots organizations of the League, and better improve the combat effectiveness of the League. The meeting also adopted a resolution on strengthening the core role of the League's grassroots organizations in rural areas among young people.

    The plenary session saw with full confidence that in 1959, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and through the efforts of the people of the whole country, China's socialist construction was continuing to leap forward, and the overall situation was developing and prosperous. The rural people's communes are becoming increasingly consolidated, and the enthusiasm of the masses for production is increasing day by day. The rich experience in the Great Leap Forward has become an extremely valuable asset for the vast number of cadres and the masses. We are facing a bright and splendid future. In the Great Leap Forward, the young people of our country resolutely followed the Party, and their enthusiasm has been very high. They have made great achievements on all fronts and have become an active force in implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction. Young people have received rich training politically, ideologically, and in their work. Communist spirit has risen to an unprecedented level, and knowledge and skills have greatly increased. There are still more than five months left until the end of 1959, and the tasks before us are still very arduous, requiring us to make greater efforts. The plenary session called on the entire League and young people across the country to continue to exert revolutionary vigor under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China, unite with the people of the whole country, work more courageously, study more diligently, and strive to welcome the 10th anniversary of the founding of the great motherland and realize the various construction tasks of 1959.

    At present, a production upsurge aimed at completing the annual national economic plan is vigorously developing in the vast cities and villages of our country. Communist Youth League organizations at all levels should, under the unified leadership and unified deployment of Party committees at all levels, develop production activities in a big way according to the characteristics of young people and in light of local conditions and times. Vigorously developing agricultural production is of great significance to the overall leap forward of the national economy. Communist Youth League organizations must become the most active force on this broad front. At present, it is necessary to mobilize rural youth to sum up experience on the basis of the summer harvest, advance victoriously, and strive for a greater autumn harvest. It is necessary to seize the opportunity to carry out activities such as accumulating fertilizer, weeding, eliminating insects, and combating drought and preventing floods. Communist Youth League members and young people should play a vanguard and leading role in developing diversified economies, especially animal husbandry. On the industrial front, the Communist Youth League should organize young workers to actively carry out various activities to increase production and practice economy centered on high quality and high yield. Educate young workers to raise their political consciousness, abide by process regulations, strive to learn advanced experience, and improve their technical proficiency, standing at the forefront of labor emulation drives. At present, special attention should be paid to ensuring product quality and saving raw materials. Increasing production and practicing economy should be regarded as a long-term policy in economic construction, and ensuring quality should be regarded as an important measure of people's sense of responsibility for the people's cause. At present, the number of new workers is very large, and the Communist Youth League must also strengthen the education of new workers, training them to become a new generation with the ideology of the working class and skilled techniques. Whether it is industrial or agricultural production, Communist Youth League organizations should mobilize young people to vigorously learn and promote advanced experience, carry out technical innovation and tool reform, and improve labor productivity; they should also continue to carry out multi-faceted small-scale scientific experiments according to production needs.

    In order to better mobilize the enthusiasm of young people, political and ideological education for young people should continue to be strengthened. At present, under the unified leadership of the Party, propaganda and education centered on the current situation and the Party's policies should be carried out in depth throughout the League and among young people across the country. Help young people recognize the great historical significance and bright future of the Great Leap Forward, inspire greater revolutionary enthusiasm, dare to overcome all difficulties in the advance, and fulfill the glorious tasks assigned to us by the Party. Building the country through diligence and thrift is our long-term fundamental policy for building socialism, and it is also a glorious tradition of the Chinese people. At present, although our country's construction has achieved rapid development, its economy is still very backward and its foundation is very weak. Even if we become rich, we must learn to live rich days as poor days, so that we can always be invincible. The entire League and young people across the country should continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of building the country through diligence and thrift and hard work, have the ambition and confidence to build our motherland more prosperous and strong with our own hands.

    The plenary session pointed out that the ideological work of the Communist Youth League must be carried out in accordance with the policy of "promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology," and adopt methods suitable for the characteristics of young people. Using positive examples to educate young people is an effective method to help young people establish good habits and good qualities. Communist Youth League committees at all levels should select good people and good deeds with typical significance in many aspects, and continue to publicize them in a big way and in a realistic manner, calling on young people to learn from those who dare to create and learn with humility, learn from those who have made outstanding achievements in ordinary work positions, learn from those who are realistic and dare to adhere to the truth, and learn from those who dare to self-sacrifice and are selfless for the interests of the country and the people. For young people with capitalist and individualistic ideas and behaviors, patient education and necessary criticism must be carried out from the perspective of love and unity. We must be good at making concrete analysis of the thinking of young people, distinguishing between enemy-us problems and internal problems of the people, position problems and cognitive problems, wrong ideas and naive behaviors, and carry out ideological work meticulously and deeply, so as to be realistic, treat them differently, improve understanding, and convince people with reason. Pay attention to overcoming the one-sidedness and simplification of ideological work.

    The plenary session also discussed the issue of caring for young people's spare-time learning and cultural and sports activities. Spare-time learning and cultural and sports activities are not only the special requirements of young people, but also the requirements of the socialist cultural revolution. The more actively young people work, the more the Communist Youth League should care about young people's spare-time life, so that young people's work, study, and rest can be carried out harmoniously and rhythmically, in order to achieve the purpose of increasing knowledge, enlivening life, strengthening the body, and promoting the all-round growth of young people.

    The plenary session emphasized that in order to adapt to the further development of the mass movement and the requirements of making work more detailed and solid, strengthening the grassroots organizations of the Communist Youth League, especially the grassroots organizations of the League in rural areas, is of particularly urgent significance at present. Grassroots organizations are the foundation of the League and the fighting bastions for realizing the various tasks of the League. If the grassroots organizations are not sound, it means the weakening of the combat effectiveness of the League, and in fact, it will also affect the Party's leadership over the youth movement. The entire League should regard strengthening grassroots organizations and strengthening grassroots work as an important task of the League's construction at present.

    In order to improve the grassroots organizations of the League, effective measures must be taken to organize and consolidate the organizations, especially to improve the League committees and branch committees, adhere to the system of combining collective leadership and division of labor and responsibility, strengthen the leading core, and quickly change the current phenomenon that some organizations are somewhat loose. It is necessary to establish regular work of the League. When carrying out work, it should generally be conceived, discussed and arranged within the League first. Do not replace the meetings within the League with the all-inclusive meetings of League members and young activists, nor should the role of production organizations replace the role of League organizations. It is necessary to attach importance to the work of developing new League members, and those activists who meet the conditions of League members should be absorbed into the League in a timely manner to increase the new blood in the League. The plenary session also pointed out that the grassroots organizations of the League must further strengthen their ties with the young masses, consult with the masses on everything, and carry forward the work style of the mass line. They must always care about the lives of young people, frequently understand and reflect the opinions and demands of the masses to the Party, and actively help the masses solve some practical problems within their capabilities. The grassroots organizations of the League should become the core of uniting the young masses, and the cadres and members of the League should become the confidants of the young masses.

    The plenary session attached great importance to the study of League cadres. Communist Youth League cadres must fully realize that learning is an important task put forward to cadres by the current era of rapid development. League cadres must be determined to work hard to read, conduct investigations and research, and engage in labor training. At present, strengthening the study of Marxism-Leninism, studying Chairman Mao's works, and studying the Party's principles and policies are of great significance for improving the political and ideological level of cadres and improving their ideological methods and working methods. Communist Youth League cadres should make full use of their spare time, study diligently, and strive to learn socialist construction theory, the Party's policies, and working methods. Arm our minds with the laws of socialist economic construction and materialist dialectics in order to better serve the people.
