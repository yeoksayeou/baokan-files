Xinhua News Agency, July 24th -- Communiqué of the Fifth Plenary Session of The Third Committee of the Communist Youth League
    The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China held its Fifth Plenary Session of the Third Committee in Qingdao, Shandong Province, from July 13th to 18th.

    The meeting listened to the work report made by Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, on behalf of the Standing Committee, focusing on discussing how to further mobilize the enthusiasm of young people across the country, actively participate in the movement to increase production and practice economy, strengthen the construction of grassroots organizations of the League, and better improve the combat effectiveness of the League. The meeting also adopted a resolution on strengthening the core role of the League's grassroots organizations in rural areas among young people.

    The plenary session saw with full confidence that in 1959, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and through the efforts of the people of the whole country, China's socialist construction was continuing to leap forward, and the overall situation was developing and prosperous. The rural people's communes are becoming increasingly consolidated, and the enthusiasm of the masses for production is increasing day by day. The rich experience in the Great Leap Forward has become an extremely valuable asset for the vast number of cadres and the masses. We are facing a bright and splendid future. In the Great Leap Forward, the young people of our country resolutely followed the Party, and their enthusiasm has been very high. They have made great achievements on all fronts and have become an active force in implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction. Young people have received rich training politically, ideologically, and in their work. Communist spirit has risen to an unprecedented level, and knowledge and skills have greatly increased. There are still more than five months left until the end of 1959, and the tasks before us are still very arduous, requiring us to make greater efforts. The plenary session called on the entire League and young people across the country to continue to exert revolutionary vigor under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China, unite with the people of the whole country, work more courageously, study more diligently, and strive to welcome the 10th anniversary of the founding of the great motherland and realize the various construction tasks of 1959.

    At present, a production upsurge aimed at completing the annual national economic plan is vigorously developing in the vast cities and villages of our country. Communist Youth League organizations at all levels should, under the unified leadership and unified deployment of Party committees at all levels, develop production activities in a big way according to the characteristics of young people and in light of local conditions and times. Vigorously developing agricultural production is of great significance to the overall leap forward of the national economy. Communist Youth League organizations must become the most active force on this broad front. At present, it is necessary to mobilize rural youth to sum up experience on the basis of the summer harvest, advance victoriously, and strive for a greater autumn harvest. It is necessary to seize the opportunity to carry out activities such as accumulating fertilizer, weeding, eliminating insects, and combating drought and preventing floods. Communist Youth League members and young people should play a vanguard and leading role in developing diversified economies, especially animal husbandry. On the industrial front, the Communist Youth League should organize young workers to actively carry out various activities to increase production and practice economy centered on high quality and high yield. Educate young workers to raise their political consciousness, abide by process regulations, strive to learn advanced experience, and improve their technical proficiency, standing at the forefront of labor emulation drives. At present, special attention should be paid to ensuring product quality and saving raw materials. Increasing production and practicing economy should be regarded as a long-term policy in economic construction, and ensuring quality should be regarded as an important measure of people's sense of responsibility for the people's cause. At present, the number of new workers is very large, and the Communist Youth League must also strengthen the education of new workers, training them to become a new generation with the ideology of the working class and skilled techniques. Whether it is industrial or agricultural production, Communist Youth League organizations should mobilize young people to vigorously learn and promote advanced experience, carry out technical innovation and tool reform, and improve labor productivity; they should also continue to carry out multi-faceted small-scale scientific experiments according to production needs.

    In order to better mobilize the enthusiasm of young people, political and ideological education for young people should continue to be strengthened. At present, under the unified leadership of the Party, propaganda and education centered on the current situation and the Party's policies should be carried out in depth throughout the League and among young people across the country. Help young people recognize the great historical significance and bright future of the Great Leap Forward, inspire greater revolutionary enthusiasm, dare to overcome all difficulties in the advance, and fulfill the glorious tasks assigned to us by the Party. Building the country through diligence and thrift is our long-term fundamental policy for building socialism, and it is also a glorious tradition of the Chinese people. At present, although our country's construction has achieved rapid development, its economy is still very backward and its foundation is very weak. Even if we become rich, we must learn to live rich days as poor days, so that we can always be invincible. The entire League and young people across the country should continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of building the country through diligence and thrift and hard work, have the ambition and confidence to build our motherland more prosperous and strong with our own hands.

    The plenary session pointed out that the ideological work of the Communist Youth League must be carried out in accordance with the policy of "promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology," and adopt methods suitable for the characteristics of young people. Using positive examples to educate young people is an effective method to help young people establish good habits and good qualities. Communist Youth League committees at all levels should select good people and good deeds with typical significance in many aspects, and continue to publicize them in a big way and in a realistic manner, calling on young people to learn from those who dare to create and learn with humility, learn from those who have made outstanding achievements in ordinary work positions, learn from those who are realistic and dare to adhere to the truth, and learn from those who dare to self-sacrifice and are selfless for the interests of the country and the people. For young people with capitalist and individualistic ideas and behaviors, patient education and necessary criticism must be carried out from the perspective of love and unity. We must be good at making concrete analysis of the thinking of young people, distinguishing between enemy-us problems and internal problems of the people, position problems and cognitive problems, wrong ideas and naive behaviors, and carry out ideological work meticulously and deeply, so as to be realistic, treat them differently, improve understanding, and convince people with reason. Pay attention to overcoming the one-sidedness and simplification of ideological work.

    The plenary session also discussed the issue of caring for young people's spare-time learning and cultural and sports activities. Spare-time learning and cultural and sports activities are not only the special requirements of young people, but also the requirements of the socialist cultural revolution. The more actively young people work, the more the Communist Youth League should care about young people's spare-time life, so that young people's work, study, and rest can be carried out harmoniously and rhythmically, in order to achieve the purpose of increasing knowledge, enlivening life, strengthening the body, and promoting the all-round growth of young people.

    The plenary session emphasized that in order to adapt to the further development of the mass movement and the requirements of making work more detailed and solid, strengthening the grassroots organizations of the Communist Youth League, especially the grassroots organizations of the League in rural areas, is of particularly urgent significance at present. Grassroots organizations are the foundation of the League and the fighting bastions for realizing the various tasks of the League. If the grassroots organizations are not sound, it means the weakening of the combat effectiveness of the League, and in fact, it will also affect the Party's leadership over the youth movement. The entire League should regard strengthening grassroots organizations and strengthening grassroots work as an important task of the League's construction at present.

    In order to improve the grassroots organizations of the League, effective measures must be taken to organize and consolidate the organizations, especially to improve the League committees and branch committees, adhere to the system of combining collective leadership and division of labor and responsibility, strengthen the leading core, and quickly change the current phenomenon that some organizations are somewhat loose. It is necessary to establish regular work of the League. When carrying out work, it should generally be conceived, discussed and arranged within the League first. Do not replace the meetings within the League with the all-inclusive meetings of League members and young activists, nor should the role of production organizations replace the role of League organizations. It is necessary to attach importance to the work of developing new League members, and those activists who meet the conditions of League members should be absorbed into the League in a timely manner to increase the new blood in the League. The plenary session also pointed out that the grassroots organizations of the League must further strengthen their ties with the young masses, consult with the masses on everything, and carry forward the work style of the mass line. They must always care about the lives of young people, frequently understand and reflect the opinions and demands of the masses to the Party, and actively help the masses solve some practical problems within their capabilities. The grassroots organizations of the League should become the core of uniting the young masses, and the cadres and members of the League should become the confidants of the young masses.

    The plenary session attached great importance to the study of League cadres. Communist Youth League cadres must fully realize that learning is an important task put forward to cadres by the current era of rapid development. League cadres must be determined to work hard to read, conduct investigations and research, and engage in labor training. At present, strengthening the study of Marxism-Leninism, studying Chairman Mao's works, and studying the Party's principles and policies are of great significance for improving the political and ideological level of cadres and improving their ideological methods and working methods. Communist Youth League cadres should make full use of their spare time, study diligently, and strive to learn socialist construction theory, the Party's policies, and working methods. Arm our minds with the laws of socialist economic construction and materialist dialectics in order to better serve the people.

    同全国人民一道更英勇地劳动更勤奋地学习
    青年们，站在增产节约第一线！
    共青团三届五中全会号召加强团的基层建设提高团的战斗力
    新华社24日讯　共青团三届五中全会的公报
    中国共产主义青年团中央委员会从7月13日到18日，在山东省青岛市举行了第三届第五次全体会议。
    会议听取了共青团中央第一书记胡耀邦代表常委会所作的工作报告，着重讨论了进一步调动全国青年的积极性，积极参加增产节约运动，加强团的基层组织建设，更好地提高团的战斗力的问题。会议并通过了关于加强农村团的基层组织在青年中的核心作用的决议。
    全会满怀信心地看到，1959年，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，经过全国人民的努力，我国的社会主义建设正在继续跃进，整个形势是发展的，兴旺的。农村人民公社日趋巩固，群众生产积极性日益高涨。大跃进中的丰富经验，已经成为广大干部和群众极其宝贵的财富。我们面临着光明灿烂的未来。在大跃进中，我国青年坚决跟着党走，干劲一直很足，在各个战线上都做出了很大的成绩，成为贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线的一支积极力量。青年从政治上、思想上和工作上，都受到了丰富的锻炼，共产主义精神空前高涨，知识和本领大为增长。现在，距1959年年底还有五个多月，摆在我们面前的任务还很艰巨，需要我们做出更大的努力。全会号召全团和全国青年在伟大的中国共产党领导下，继续鼓足革命干劲，同全国人民团结一致，更英勇地劳动，更勤奋地学习，为迎接伟大祖国的国庆十周年，实现1959年的各项建设任务而奋斗。
    现在，以完成全年国民经济计划为目标的生产高潮，正在我国广大的城市和乡村蓬勃发展。各级共青团组织，应当在各级党委的统一领导和统一部署下，根据青年特点，因地因时制宜，大搞生产活动。努力发展农业生产，对于国民经济的全面跃进，具有重大的意义。共青团组织要在这个广阔的战线上成为一支最活跃的力量，目前要发动农村青年在夏季丰收的基础上，总结经验，乘胜前进，争取秋季更大丰收，要抓紧开展积肥造肥、锄草除虫、抗旱防涝等活动。在发展多种经济，特别是发展畜牧业方面，共青团员和青年应当发挥突击和带头作用。在工业战线上，共青团要组织青年工人，积极开展以优质高产为中心的多种多样的增产节约活动。教育青年工人提高政治觉悟，遵守工艺规程，努力学习先进经验，提高技术熟练程度，站在劳动竞赛的前列。当前要特别注意保证产品质量和节约原料材料。要把增产节约看成是经济建设中的长期方针，把保证质量看成是衡量人们对人民事业责任感的重要标尺。目前新工人的数量很大，共青团还要特别加强新工人的教育工作，培养他们成为具有工人阶级思想和熟练技术的新一代。无论是工业和农业生产，共青团组织都应当发动青年大力学习和推广先进经验，大搞技术革新和工具改革，提高劳动生产率；还应当根据生产需要，继续进行多方面的小型的科学试验活动。
    为了更好地把青年的积极性调动起来，应当继续加强对青年的政治思想教育，当前要在党的统一领导下，在全团和全国青年中深入进行以当前形势和党的政策为中心的宣传教育。帮助青年认清大跃进的伟大历史意义和光明灿烂的未来，鼓起更大的革命干劲，勇于战胜前进中的一切困难，去实现党所交给我们的光荣任务。勤俭建国是我们建设社会主义的长期的根本方针，也是我国人民的光荣传统。现在，我们国家的建设事业虽然获得了飞跃的发展，但经济上还很落后，底子很薄，即使富裕了，也要学会把富日子当穷日子过，这样就可使我们永远立于不败之地。全团和全国青年应当继续发扬勤俭建国艰苦奋斗的革命精神，有志气有信心用自己的双手把我们的祖国建设得更加繁荣富强。　
    全会指出，共青团的思想工作，必须根据“兴无灭资”的方针，采取适合青年特点的方法去进行。运用正面典型来教育青年，是帮助青年树立好风气、好品质的有效方法。各级团委应当选择多方面的有典型意义的好人好事，继续大张旗鼓地实事求是地进行宣传，号召青年向勇敢创造、虚心学习的人看齐，向在平凡工作岗位上做出出色成就的人看齐，向实事求是、勇于坚持真理的人看齐，向为了国家和人民利益而勇于自我牺牲，大公无私的人看齐。对于有资本主义和个人主义思想行为的青年，必须从爱护和团结的观点出发，进行耐心教育和必要的批评。对青年的思想要善于做具体分析，分清敌我问题还是人民内部问题，立场问题还是认识问题，错误思想还是幼稚行为，细致地、深入地进行思想工作，做到实事求是，区别对待，提高认识，以理服人。注意克服思想工作的片面性和简单化。
    全会也讨论了关心青年业余学习和文化体育活动的问题。业余学习和文化体育活动，不仅是青年的特殊要求，也是社会主义文化革命的要求。青年们越是积极劳动，共青团也就应当越发关心青年的业余生活，使青年的劳动、学习、休息和谐地有节奏地进行，以达到增长知识、活跃生活、强健身体和促进青年全面成长的目的。
    全会着重指出，为着适应群众运动的进一步发展和工作越做越细致越扎实的要求，加强共青团基层组织，特别是农村团的基层组织的建设，在目前有着十分迫切的意义。基层组织是团的基础，是实现团的各项工作的战斗堡垒。如果基层组织不健全，那就意味着团的战斗力的削弱，实际上也就影响到党对青年运动的领导。全团应当把健全基层组织，加强基层工作，作为当前团的建设一项重要任务。
    为了健全团的基层组织，必须采取有效办法，把组织整理好，特别要健全团的委员会和支部委员会，坚持实行集体领导和分工负责相结合的制度，加强领导核心，迅速改变目前部分组织有些松散的现象。要建立团的经常工作，在进行工作的时候，一般应当先在团内酝酿、讨论和布置，不要以团员和青年积极分子的一揽子会议代替团内的会议，也不要以生产组织的作用代替团的组织的作用。要重视发展新团员的工作，应当及时地把那些合乎团员条件的积极分子吸收到团内来，增加团内的新血液。全会还指出：团的基层组织必须进一步密切和青年群众的联系，有事同群众商量，发扬群众路线的工作作风。要时刻关心青年的生活，经常了解和向党反映群众的意见和要求，并且在力所能及的条件下，积极地帮助群众解决一些实际问题。团的基层组织应当成为团结青年群众的核心，团的干部和团员应当成为青年群众的知心朋友。
    全会对于团的干部的学习，给予极大的重视。共青团干部要充分认识到学习是目前飞跃发展的时代向干部所提出的一个重要任务。团的干部要在工作中下决心努力读书、进行调查研究和劳动锻炼。在目前，加强学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛主席的著作，学习党的方针政策，对于提高干部的政治思想水平，改进思想方法和工作方法，有十分重要的意义。共青团干部应该尽量利用业余时间，刻苦钻研，努力学习社会主义建设理论、党的政策和工作方法。用社会主义经济建设的规律和唯物辩证法把我们的头脑武装起来，以便更好地为人民服务。
