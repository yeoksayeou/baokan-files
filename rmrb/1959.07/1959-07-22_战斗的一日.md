    A Day of Battle
    Early in the morning, the sun quietly peeked its face from the eastern horizon, painting the azure sky with a layer of faint red霞, the increasingly intense light sprinkled on the continuous ripe early rice ears, golden waves rolling. The "double抢" (double rush - refers to the simultaneous harvesting of early rice and planting of late rice) combat team members of the Third Small Team of the Heping Production Team of the Mingshan Commune in Nanxian County, Hunan, full of joy of harvest, talking and laughing, walked lively towards the golden fields.
    Arriving at the edge of the field, female commune member Zhang Fengying jumped down into the field first, "嚓! 嚓! 嚓!" opening the first sickle. A joyful mountain song burst out from her heart: "The benefits of collectivization are greater than the sky, our women's lives are so sweet, last year I revolved around the stove, this year I start the first sickle with a bumper harvest. The first sickle, my heart is even sweeter, the liberation of women across the country is in the millions." Before her song ended, Wang Haiquan, who was arranging the "bàn zhé" (pleated mat around the rice tub), chimed in, "The benefits of collectivization are greater than the sky, collective life is sweet for everyone, thousands of stoves changed to one stove cooking, tea and meals are at hand on time. At hand, boosting our energy, everyone is racing to be first in the 'double rush'." Their singing in unison increased everyone's excitement and further encouraged everyone's confidence in completing this year's "double rush" task ahead of schedule.
    The sun rose higher and higher, and the battle entered an intense and fierce stage. Strike team leader Chun Zhenxiang drummed the rice tub loudly, handing a battle challenge to his opponent Yin Guohua, saying, "Old in-law, we go into battle every day, and high or low is decided on the battlefield, how about we have three finals a day? Whoever fills the least will lose three meals." "Not just three meals, compared to your tofu buckets, I'll add three pots of tea." The answer caused a burst of hearty laughter from the surrounding crowd.
    It was almost noon, and the harvested empty fields were getting bigger and bigger, giving the manure spreading oxen team more room to work. The field was filled with oxen and people, making it even livelier.
    After lunch, Guo Zhanggui, the secretary of the commune Party committee, and Tie Ruisheng rushed from Mingshantou, fifteen miles away, to join the battle, and without even resting their feet, they began transplanting rice seedlings together with the commune members. "Welcome Secretary Guo to transplant the border rows!" Someone shouted, and everyone gave a "aha" and cleared a space. He greeted everyone while busy rolling up his trousers and going down into the field. Just as he was getting ready, the crowd on the right surged up. Old Guo calmly stretched out his leg, squatted down, tightened his hands, and unleashed his "continuous branching seedling" stunt. The faster the points, the straighter the four bundles of seedlings were, as if they were being pulled by a string. A young man transplanting the border rows was amazed, measuring the horizontal and vertical distances again and again with his hand, and couldn't help but exclaim, "Secretary Guo's 5×7 is as straight as if it was dragged by a frame!" Everyone listened and hurriedly compared it to their own, fearing that it would look "foolish." Everyone concentrated and tried their best to make their transplants meet the standards. In a few rounds, a three-mu field was quickly covered in green. (荷立)

    战斗的一日
    清早，太阳从东边地平线悄悄地露出脸来，蔚蓝色的天空，抹上了一层淡淡的红霞，越来越强烈的光辉，撒在连片成熟的早稻穗上，金波滚滚。湖南南县明山公社和平生产队三小队的“双抢”战斗队员们，都满怀丰收喜悦的心情，说着笑着，一路热热闹闹地走向金黄色的田野。
    到了田边，女社员张凤英一步先窜下了田，“嚓！嚓！嚓”的开了第一镰。喜悦的山歌，从内心里冲口而出：“公社化的好处大如天，我们妇女生活过的甜，去年我围着灶屋里转，今年丰收我开头一镰。头一镰，心更甜，全国解放妇女万万千。”她的歌声还未落，在一边扦着扮折（扮桶上围的折席）的王海全接上了腔，“公社化的好处大如天，集体生活人人甜，千灶改为一炉煮，茶饭依时在手边。在手边，干劲添，双抢人人都争先”。他俩一唱一和，增加了大家的兴奋，更鼓舞了每个人对今年双抢任务提前完成的信心。
    太阳越升越高，战斗也进入了紧张激烈的阶段。突击组长淳振湘将禾桶扮得咚咚地响，边向他的对手殷国华递战表说：“老亲家，一天一上阵，上阵见高低，我们一天来个三次决赛好不好？谁扮得少的，就输掉三餐饭。”“莫说三餐饭，同你们这号豆腐桶比，还加上三壶茶。”回答引起周围人群一阵爽朗的笑声。
    快晌午了，收割完了的空田越来越大，撒粪用牛组的健儿们更有了用武之地。田里牛来人往，更加热闹。
    中饭过后，公社党委书记郭章贵、铁瑞生从十五里外的明山头赶来参战，连脚也没有歇，就同社员们一道插秧。“欢迎郭书记来扦边系！”不知是谁这么一嚷，大家一个啊哈，就闪出了一条空。他一边和大家打招呼，一边忙卷起裤子下田。刚亮开架势，右边的人群就拥上来了。老郭不慌不忙的将腿一伸，身子再向下一蹲，双手一紧，将自己拿手的“连环分秧”绝技施展出来了。点子越快，四兜禾也像牵了线一样的直。扦边系的一个小伙子看得出奇，横直距离用手量了又量，不禁连声地嚷着，“郭书记扦的5×7就同拖了架子一样！”大家听了，连忙对照自己扦的，怕比起来会出“洋相”。大家都集中注意力，尽量使自己扦的全合标准。几个来回，一丘三亩大的田很快的就披上了绿油油的新装。　（荷立）
