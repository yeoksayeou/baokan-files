Apply More Refined Fertilizer to Produce More Autumn Cotton Bolls
Jianyang Liberation Cultivation Area Strengthens Cotton Field Management During the Summer and Autumn Period

(Our dispatch) The masses in the Liberation Cultivation Area of the Liberation Commune in Jianyang County, Sichuan Province, are seizing the current period of fastest cotton growth and development, concentrating manpower and most of their refined fertilizer and pesticides to focus on topdressing during the peak flowering period and preventing and controlling pests during the bud and boll stage, striving to produce more autumn cotton bolls. At the same time, they are laying a good foundation for harvesting later autumn cotton bolls, ensuring a comprehensive high yield of cotton.

Recently, the general Party branch of this cultivation area convened a technical committee to analyze and study the current cotton growth situation and the next specific measures. Everyone agreed that a large area of cotton fields had already produced a stable batch of mature cotton bolls before entering the hot summer period, and the cotton plants were growing vigorously, which was the result of grasping early-stage cotton management. The "Dog Days of Summer" is the season when cotton flowers and produces bolls most vigorously and rapidly, and the "autumn cotton bolls" that determine cotton yield are formed during this period; the "later autumn cotton bolls" flower buds also mainly appear during this period. Therefore, it is entirely possible to seize the current key and favorable opportunity, take correct measures, firmly grasp the autumn cotton bolls, and strive to produce more later autumn cotton bolls to achieve high yields. Everyone also believed that the "Dog Days of Summer" is also the stage of cotton growth when it requires the most fertilizer and water, pests are most prevalent, and field management requirements are the strictest, as well as the season with the most severe boll shedding. This year, due to the dry weather and the large area of cotton entering the hot summer carrying cotton bolls which consume a lot of fertilizer, coupled with insufficient soil moisture and the difficulty in releasing fertilizer effectiveness, the growth of a few cotton plants is slow, and some individual plants even have a "tapering" and have stopped growing. Although there has been a welcome soaking rain recently, it still requires more timely and meticulous management to restore normal growth, otherwise early aging of cotton plants and severe boll shedding will still be difficult to avoid.

In response to the above situation and the current climatic conditions and cotton growth characteristics, after discussion, it was decided to seize the summer and autumn period and implement "heavy application of large amounts of fertilizer," using 20 buckets of human manure per mu, 2,000 jin of mud fertilizer, sheep ash manure, etc., and increasing the amount of fast-acting fertilizers such as ammonium nitrate and urea, and also applying some superphosphate, oil cake and other fine fertilizers. It is required that in fertilization, cotton fields with many bolls but weak growth should be fertilized first, and those with few bolls but vigorous growth should be fertilized later; sandy soil has weak water and fertilizer retention capacity, but fertilizer effectiveness is released faster, so apply appropriately less; clay soil has strong fertilizer retention capacity, and fertilizer effectiveness is released more slowly, so implement heavy application at once. At the same time, strengthen the power of professional pest control teams, and use high-efficiency pesticides such as wettable "223" sulfur powder, mixed with "1605", to spray and kill pink bollworms, leaf rollers, etc.

In order to do a good job in field management measures during the peak flowering period, the Party and Youth League organizations of the cultivation area also convened a meeting of cadres and Party and Youth League members from the entire cultivation area, conducted ideological mobilization, and launched a comparison and competition movement between teams and individuals. Everyone pledged to complete the task of topdressing during the peak flowering period with quality and quantity within seven to ten sunny days. The day after the meeting, more than 90% of the agricultural labor force enthusiastically took action. Within three days, the entire cultivation area combined deep tilling and soil consolidation with fertilizer application for about 600 mu, and pest control for more than 900 mu; at the same time as fertilizing, each team adopted methods such as seizing rainy days to carry out intensive green manure soaking, accumulating and sieving mud fertilizer, and diverting water to wash hair pits to accumulate fertilizer.

### 多施精肥　多结伏桃  简阳解放耕作区加强暑伏期棉田管理

    多施精肥　多结伏桃
    简阳解放耕作区加强暑伏期棉田管理
    本报讯　四川简阳县解放公社解放耕作区、群众正抓紧当前棉花生长发育最快的时机，集中人力和大部分精肥、农药，突击盛花期追肥和防治蕾铃期虫害，力争多结伏桃；同时为抓秋桃打好基础，确保棉花全面高产。
    最近，这个耕作区党总支召开了技术委员会，分析研究了当前棉花生长情况和下一步的具体措施，大家一致认为，大面积的棉田在入伏前就结稳了一批硬桃，棉株生长兴旺，这是抓紧棉花前期管理的结果。“三伏天”是棉花开花结桃最盛最快的时令，决定棉花增产的“伏桃”就在这个时期内形成：“秋桃”花蕾也主要在这个时期内出现。因此抓住当前带关键性的有利时机，采取正确的措施，狠狠地抓稳伏桃，再争取多结一部分秋桃，达到高产是完全可能的。大家还认为，“三伏天”也是棉花正处在需肥、需水最多，虫害最盛，对田间管理要求最严格的生育阶段，也是棉铃脱落最严重的季节。今年由于天气干旱，和大面积带桃入伏耗肥较多，加以土壤水分不足，肥效难于发挥，少数棉株生长缓慢，个别的甚至有“收尖”停止生长的情况。虽然最近喜得透雨，但要恢复正常生长，还需更及时细致的管理，否则棉株早衰和严重的蕾铃脱落现象仍然难于避免。
    针对上述情况和目前气候条件与棉花生长特点，经过讨论，决定抓紧暑伏期，实行“大肥重施”，每亩用水粪二十挑，泥肥、羊灰粪等二千斤，并加重硝酸铵、尿素等速效肥的用量，再配合施用部分过磷酸钙、油饼等细肥。要求在施肥中，应该对桃多生长弱的棉田先施，桃少生长旺盛的后施；沙土保水保肥力弱，但肥效发挥较快，适当少施；泥土保肥力强，肥效发挥较慢，实行一次重施。同时加强专业治虫组的力量，用高效率农药如可湿性
  “二二三”硫磺粉，与“一六零五”混合，喷射杀灭红铃虫、卷叶虫等。
    为了抓好盛花期的田间管理措施，耕作区党、团组织还召开了全耕区的干部和党、团员大会，作了思想动员，开展了一个队与队、个人与个人之间的评比竞赛运动，大家纷纷保证在七至十个晴天之内，按质按量的完成盛花期追肥任务。会后的第二天，90％以上的农业劳动力就热情高涨地行动起来了，全耕区在三天之内就结合中耕培土施肥约六百亩，治虫九百多亩；在施肥的同时，各队都采用趁雨天突击泡青、积筛泥肥、引水洗毛坑等方法积造肥料。
