    Later Pinching, More Cotton Bolls
    Cotton Planting Expert Xue Junxiu
    If you want a bountiful harvest of cotton bolls, we gained one experience last year, which is to appropriately delay pinching. Some people used to say: "Pinch the cotton on June 6th (lunar calendar)." We felt it wasn't quite right. Mechanically topping at this time, the nutrients of the cotton have not been fully utilized. After topping, it either causes rampant growth or fewer fruiting branches and fewer cotton bolls. Appropriately delaying topping can increase the number of fruiting branches. With more fruiting branches, there will be more bolls near the main stalk. These bolls are close to the main stalk, have sufficient nutrition, and are not easy to fall off.
    Some people are afraid that delayed pinching will cause bolls to fall off. This reason is not valid. As long as you pinch in batches according to the soil fertility and cotton growth, so that nutrients can be supplied on time, it will not cause bud or boll drop. How long should the delay be? It depends on the specific situation. Last year, we appropriately delayed the topping by about half a month, leaving an average of seventeen or eighteen fruiting branches per plant. The pinching was delayed for several days, and it was completed in three batches from bottom to top, leaving two more bolls per branch than in previous years. In the autumn of that year, each plant averaged more than sixty cotton bolls. Isn't that a bountiful harvest of cotton bolls!

### 迟打尖　棉桃多

    迟打尖　棉桃多

    要想棉桃累累，我们去年得有一条经验，就是适当推迟打尖。原来有人说：“6月6（阴历）棉花打顶哩”。我们觉得不太合适。机械地按这个时间打顶，棉花的养分还没全用出来，打顶后不是引起疯长，就是少长担子（果枝）少座桃。适当迟打顶，就能多长担子，担子多了，靠近主秆的桃子就多，这些桃子靠近主秆，营养足，也不容易脱落。
    有人怕迟打群尖肯落桃。这个理由也不多。只要按地力和棉花生长情况，分几次迟打群尖，使养分能按时供应上，不会引起落蕾落铃。推迟多长时期呢？这要看具体情况。去年打顶，我们适当推迟了半月左右，每株平均留到十七、八个担子。打群尖推迟了好几天，先下后上的分三次打完，每个担子能比往年多留两个桃。这一年秋后，每株平均结六十多个棉桃，难道不是棉桃累累吗！
