    Young Children Receive Dedicated Care
    Before the start of the "Double Rush" (harvesting of early rice and planting of late rice), the Tongsheng Brigade of the Daolin Commune in Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, established various childcare organizations based on the demands of the women.
    In order to strengthen leadership over childcare work, the brigade's general Party branch committee appointed a general branch committee member and the women's director to oversee this work. Each production team formed a management team composed of the women's team leader, nursery workers, mother representatives, and canteen accountants to regularly inspect and supervise the daily work of the nurseries and kindergartens, listen to the people's feedback, and conduct appraisal competitions – comparing children's health, cleanliness, service attitude, unity and mutual assistance, and childcare methods. This greatly improved the work of the nurseries and kindergartens.
    During the "Double Rush," in order to ensure that mothers could work easily, temporary childcare groups and kindergarten classes were also added, so that young children who had not yet entered nurseries or kindergartens were cared for by dedicated personnel. At the same time, it was stipulated that breastfed children should be fed milk four times a day, and weaned children should be fed porridge four times a day.
    After the brigade adopted the above measures, the number of infants and young children entering nurseries gradually increased, and all children who could enter kindergartens were enrolled. Now the children live very well in kindergartens and nurseries, and are all strong, lively, and lovely. All fifty-four women in the team were freed from the burden of their children and threw themselves into the "Double Rush" battle without any worries.

    小宝宝有专人照管
    在“双抢”开始以前，湖南宁乡县道林公社同升大队根据妇女的要求，办好各种托儿组织。
    为了加强对托儿工作的领导，大队总支委员会确定了一位总支委员和妇女主任负责抓这一工作；各个生产队由妇女队长、保育员、母亲代表、食堂会计等组成管理小组，经常检查督促托儿所、幼儿园的日常工作，听取群众反映，开展评比竞赛——比小孩健壮、比清洁卫生、比服务态度、比团结互助、比带管方法。这样大大改进了托儿所和幼儿园的工作。
    在“双抢”期间，为了保证母亲出工方便，还增办了临时托儿组和幼儿班。使尚未入托、入园的小孩都有专人带管。同时，规定了吃奶的小孩每日送奶四次，断奶的喂四次稀饭。
    这个大队采取了上述措施后，入托婴幼儿逐渐增加，能入幼儿园的儿童全部入园了。现在小孩在幼儿园、托儿所里生活得很好，个个结实，活泼可爱。全队五十四个妇女摆脱了孩子的拖累，无牵无挂地投入了“双抢”战斗。
