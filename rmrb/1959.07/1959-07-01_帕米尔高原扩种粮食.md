Xinhua News Agency Report: The Tajik, Kirgiz, and Uyghur peoples on the Pamir Plateau are vigorously developing grain and fodder production on the plateau. Currently, the early-sown major grain crops of wheat and highland barley are lush green, with some already growing to over a foot tall.

	Although the Pamir Plateau remained chilly in May, farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups in Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County began sowing ten days earlier than in previous years. In addition to sowing cold-resistant and early-maturing spring wheat, barley, highland barley, broad beans, corn, millet, and other grain crops, they also sowed oil crops such as rapeseed, flax, and sunflowers, as well as vegetables. In the Mushtag (Ice Mountain) Commune, irrigated by hot springs, and the Yarkand Commune, with its earlier warm climate, farmers and herdsmen are trying to grow rice for the first time this year.

	Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County has always been dominated by animal husbandry, with very underdeveloped agriculture, making it a well-known grain-deficient area in Xinjiang. Since last winter, all seven people's communes in the county have transferred 50% to 60% of their labor force to participate in agricultural production. An unprecedented upsurge of winter manure accumulation and water conservancy construction has swept the Pamir Plateau, preparing the conditions for expanding the grain sowing area this year.

     帕米尔高原扩种粮食
     据新华社讯　帕米尔高原上的塔吉克、柯尔克孜和维吾尔等族人民，正在大力发展高原上的粮食、饲料生产。目前，早播的主要粮食作物小麦和青稞一片葱绿，有的已长到一尺多高。
    5月的帕米尔高原依然春寒料峭，但是塔什库尔干塔吉克族自治县的各族农牧民比往年提前十天播种。他们除播种了耐寒早熟的春小麦、大麦、青稞、蚕豆、玉米、糜子等粮食作物以外，还播种了油菜、葫麻、向日葵等油料作物和蔬菜。在有温泉灌溉的慕士塔格（冰山）公社和气候早暖的叶尔羌公社，农牧民们今年第一次试种了水稻。
    塔什库尔干塔吉克族自治县一向以畜牧业为主，农业很不发达，是新疆有名的缺粮地区。去冬以来，全县七个人民公社都抽调了50％到60％的劳动力参加农业生产，帕米尔高原上掀起了史无前例的冬季积肥和兴修水利的热潮，为今年扩大粮食播种面积准备了条件。（附图片）
