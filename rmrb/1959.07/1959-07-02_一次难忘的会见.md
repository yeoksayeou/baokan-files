    An Unforgettable Meeting
    Xiao San
    It was the evening of February 28, 1935. The hall of the Soviet Writers' House (located next to the Soviet Writers' Association on Volovsky Street, part of the real-life setting for Natasha's home in Tolstoy's "War and Peace," now known as the "Moscow Literary House") was brightly lit, and the atmosphere was solemn. More than a hundred Soviet writers and a dozen foreign writers waited with excitement to meet Comrade Dimitrov.

    A moment later, the lights shone even brighter, and amidst applause, a robust figure with a serious but kind face entered the hall. The entire audience rose and applauded to welcome Comrade Dimitrov. The host led him to the podium. People immediately felt that this world-renowned anti-fascist hero, this great communist fighter, was so simple and approachable. A writer next to me whispered, "He is both great and ordinary." This reminded me of the first line of a Chinese couplet: "Only a great hero can be true to his original self." Yes, Comrade Dimitrov was very much himself. His life, a life of loyal and courageous struggle for the liberation of workers and peasants and for the cause of communism, everywhere displayed the essence of the proletariat and communists.

    The meeting's host didn't need to say much. After a brief and warm welcome to the honored guest, he invited Comrade Dimitrov to speak to us. Comrade Dimitrov's words were short but full of great power. He called on the writers to use the materials from the Leipzig trial and the archetypes of the various people involved in the case to educate the people on the anti-fascist front. He said that such materials and such archetypes have not yet been touched upon by artists...

    Comrade Dimitrov pointed out that writers often meticulously suck on their fingers to create subjective lyric poetry, while neglecting materials that, in their hands, could inspire the revolutionary will of millions.

    Then Comrade Dimitrov raised his voice and exclaimed: Give us living, flesh-and-blood people in your works, people who make the reader want to become like your positive characters, and use the negative characters to expose the enemy. Just as Cervantes (note) struck and crushed the dying feudal aristocracy in his time, so should we strike today's bloody clowns of fascism, who are frantically trying to turn the wheel of history backward.

    That evening, several foreign revolutionary writers residing in the Soviet Union spoke or read their works. The host introduced them as the German communist writer Willi Bredel; the Polish communist writer Stande; the Chinese communist writer Ai Mi Xiao...

    That evening, I read a poem celebrating the fifteenth anniversary of the Communist International, and I only remember these few lines:

      ...Iron Dimitrov—our helmsman.
      Our captain—Comrade Stalin.
      Raise it higher,
            Higher,
                    Higher still
        The banner of communism!

    After each person spoke, they approached Comrade Dimitrov to pay their respects. He stood up, extended his hand to shake theirs firmly, his bright eyes looking at them.

    The next day, March 1st, Pravda published a news item titled "Comrade G. Dimitrov with Soviet Writers."
  (Because I treasured this meeting so much, I cut out this news item from the newspaper and have kept it to this day without losing it, which can also be said to be a miracle.)

    More than twenty years have passed, but the impression of that meeting with this giant—warrior—is still very vivid and profound. Ten years ago today, I saw Comrade Dimitrov again, but it was his remains... In the Hall of Columns of the Moscow Trade Union Building, the crystal lamps were covered with black gauze. Red flags were at half-mast. Tens of thousands of workers walked around the open coffin, heads bowed, tears in their eyes, to bid a final farewell to this outstanding son of the Bulgarian people, a friend and leader of the working masses of the world.

    In the early 1950s, I visited Bulgaria, this fraternal country, twice. In Sofia, I visited the Mausoleum twice—the tomb of Comrade Dimitrov, a pure white marble building. Lying in the crystal coffin, he looked lifelike. He had been dead for a full ten years, but he lives forever in people's hearts. Comrade Dimitrov is not dead!

    一次难忘的会见
    萧三
    那是1935年2月28日的晚上。苏联作家之家（座落在沃洛夫斯基街苏联作家协会的旁边，列夫·托尔斯泰写的“战争与和平”里女主人公娜塔莎之家的部分真实背景，现名为“莫斯科文学家之家”）的厅堂里灯光明亮，气氛肃穆。百多个苏联作家和十来个外国作家怀着激动的心情，等待着季米特洛夫同志来和我们见面。
    一会儿，灯光更亮了，掌声响处，一个身躯魁梧、面色严肃而又亲切的人走进了会场。全场起立拍手欢迎季米特洛夫同志。主持人引他到主席台上坐下。人们顿时感觉得，这位全世界闻名的反法西斯的英雄，伟大的共产主义战士，原来是这样朴素，这样平易近人的。在我旁边的一位作家小声地说：“他很伟大，又很平凡。”我因而想起中国一副对联的上联：“惟大英雄能本色”。是的，季米特洛夫同志是很本色的。他的一生，为工人农民的解放和共产主义事业而忠贞地、英勇地奋斗的一生，处处都显示出无产阶级、共产党人的本色。
    会议的主持者用不着多作介绍，在向尊贵的客人致简短而热情的欢迎词之后，请季米特洛夫同志给我们讲话。季米特洛夫同志的话很短，但是充满了巨大的力量。他号召作家们利用来比锡案件的材料和在这个案件里经过的各类人的典型，来教育反法西斯战线的人们。他说，这种材料和这些典型，直到现在还没有被文艺家触及……
    季米特洛夫同志指出，作家们往往专心细致地从自己的手指头吮吸主观的抒情诗，而不注意一些材料，这些材料在他们的笔下能够推动成百万人的革命毅力。
    然后季米特洛夫同志提高嗓音感叹地说：在你们的作品里给我们活的、有血有肉的人，使得读者成为你们的正面人物那样的人，而反面人物就用来揭露敌人吧。如同塞万提斯（注）在他那个时代打击过和粉碎了垂死的封建贵族一样，应该打击今天法西斯主义的血腥的小丑们，这些家伙疯狂地企图扭转历史的舵轮向后退。
    在这个晚会上留居苏联的几个外国革命作家讲了话或读了自己的作品。主持人介绍时说，德国共产主义作家维利·布勒德里；波兰共产主义作家斯汤德；中国共产主义作家埃弥·萧……
    我那天晚上读了一首庆祝共产国际成立十五周年的诗，只记得这样几句：
      ……铁的季米特洛夫——我们的舵手。
      我们的船长——斯大林同志。
      举高些，
            高些，
                    更高些
        共产主义的旗帜！
    每个人发言后都趋与季米特洛夫同志致敬。他站起身子，伸出手来用力地相握，炯炯有光的两眼看着对方。
    第二天，3月1日的“真理报”上发表了一则新闻，题为“Γ·季米特洛夫同志在苏联作家们那里”。
  （我因为非常珍贵这次的会见，把报纸上这条新闻裁了下来，一直保存到现在而没有遗失，也可说是奇迹哩。）
    时间已经过去二十多年了，但是那一次和这位巨人—战士会见的印象，直到现在还是非常鲜明而深刻的。十年前的今天我又看见了季米特洛夫同志，但那是他的遗体……在莫斯科职工会大厦的圆柱厅里，水晶灯上都罩着黑纱。红旗半垂。成千成万的劳动者绕着敞开的棺材而过，低着头，含着泪，向这位保加利亚人民的优秀儿子、全世界劳动群众的朋友和领袖作最后的诀别。
    五十年代初我曾两次到过保加利亚这个兄弟之邦。在索非亚两次都曾谒白陵——纯白色大理石建筑的季米特洛夫同志的陵墓。水晶棺里躺着的他，栩栩如生。他去世已整整十年了，但他永远活在人们的心里。季米特洛夫同志不死！
