    Celebrating the First Anniversary of the Founding of the Republic of Iraq
    Bao Erhan
    On July 14, 1958, after a long period of struggle, the Iraqi people finally overthrew the reactionary rule of the feudal dynasty of Faisal, the imperialist agent, which had been a mountain weighing on their heads. They established their own republic and embarked on the path of independence, prosperity, and progress. The success of the Iraqi revolution is a major victory in the struggle against imperialism and for national independence in recent years. This victory greatly shook the cornerstone of imperialism's aggression in the Middle East. All peace-loving people around the world are encouraged and inspired by the Iraqi revolution.
    Both the Chinese and Iraqi people have suffered from imperialist oppression for a long time and have waged arduous struggles against it. Therefore, when the news of the success of the Iraqi revolution reached our country, the Chinese people expressed their heartfelt congratulations to the Iraqi brothers who had broken free from the shackles of imperialism and gained independence. We firmly support the Iraqi people in their struggle against imperialism and to defend their republic.
    China and Iraq are both countries with long cultural histories. The Tigris-Euphrates river basin in Iraq and the Yellow River-Yangtze River basin in China are both cradles of human civilization. Our two countries have had friendly exchanges since ancient times. According to records, as early as 97 AD, the Eastern Han Dynasty of China sent Gan Ying as an envoy to Tiaozhi, which is now Iraq. In the seventh century, the Black-Robed Abbasid Dynasty of Baghdad sent envoys to the Tang Dynasty of China. In the fifth century, Chinese ships were often found on the Euphrates River. From the seventh to the thirteenth centuries, commerce and transportation between China and Arab countries were very developed. At that time, there were two routes, by land and by sea, that both reached Baghdad. From the above historical records, it can be seen that the friendly exchanges between the Chinese and Iraqi people have a history of about two thousand years. This relationship was only interrupted after the invasion of imperialist forces into both countries. With the success of the revolutions in both countries, this relationship has naturally been restored and developed. In the first few days after the establishment of the Republic of Iraq, the two countries recognized each other and quickly established diplomatic relations. In a short year, the political, economic, and cultural relations between our two countries have developed rapidly. In particular, the mutual dispatch of various delegations for friendly visits has further promoted the friendship and cooperation between the two peoples. Shortly after the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, the Iraqi People's Friendship Delegation, Cultural Delegation, and delegations of social activists and students visited our country. During their visit, the Chinese people established the Sino-Iraqi Friendship Association in Beijing. Last December, the Chinese Trade Delegation visited Iraq and signed the Sino-Iraqi Trade and Payment Agreement. Later, Chinese student and women's delegations were invited to participate in the Iraqi student and women's congresses. In March of this year, the Chinese Cultural Delegation paid a friendly visit to Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government and signed a cultural cooperation agreement between the two countries. During the visit of the Chinese Cultural Delegation to Iraq, the Iraqi people established the Iraqi-Chinese Friendship Association in Baghdad. Currently, our government delegation is participating in the celebrations of the first anniversary of the Iraqi revolution. Through this series of activities, the friendly relations between the peoples of the two countries have been further developed.
    After the establishment of the Republic of Iraq, it pursued a policy of peace and neutrality in accordance with the Bandung spirit and actively developed relations with peaceful and friendly countries. These measures have won the support of peace-loving countries and peoples around the world and enhanced their international prestige. The success of the Iraqi revolution means a major defeat for imperialism. Imperialists and reactionaries are always trying to destroy this new republic. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Qasim, and relying on the support of the people, the Republic of Iraq has crushed many enemy invasions and subversive activities, and the people have been further tempered. Although imperialists and reactionaries are still carrying out new conspiracies, the Iraqi people, who have experience in the struggle against imperialism, will continue to raise their vigilance, strengthen unity, and persist in the struggle. Any conspiracy of imperialism and reactionaries is doomed to failure. The Iraqi people can expect to receive the firm support of the Chinese people in opposing imperialism, safeguarding national independence, and building their country! May the friendship between the Chinese and Iraqi people last forever!

    庆祝伊拉克共和国成立一周年
    包尔汉
    1958年7月14日，伊拉克人民经过长期的斗争，终于推翻了压在自己头上的大山——帝国主义代理人费萨尔封建王朝的反动统治，建立了自己的共和国；开始走上独立、繁荣、进步的道路。伊拉克革命的成功，是近几年来反对帝国主义、争取民族独立斗争中的一个重大的胜利。这一胜利大大地振撼了帝国主义在中东进行侵略的基石。全世界爱好和平人民对此莫不感到欢欣鼓舞，正在进行民族独立斗争的人民从伊拉克的革命中受到了鼓励和教益。
    我国人民和伊拉克人民都曾经长期深受帝国主义的压迫、并与之进行了艰苦的斗争。因此，当伊拉克革命成功的消息传到我国的时候，我国人民对挣脱帝国主义枷锁而获得了独立的伊拉克兄弟表示衷心的祝贺，对伊拉克人民为反对帝国主义，保卫共和国所进行的斗争，表示坚决的支持。
    中伊两国都是具有悠久文化历史的国家。伊拉克的幼发拉底河和底格里斯河两河流域和中国的黄河长江两河流域一样，都是人类文化发祥地之一。我们两国从很古远的时代就进行了友好往来。据记载，早在公元97年，中国东汉王朝即派甘英出使，到过条支，即现在的伊拉克。公元七世纪，巴格达的黑衣大食王朝曾向中国唐朝派出使节。公元五世纪，幼发拉底河上就常发现中国船只。七世纪到十三世纪，中国和阿拉伯国家的商业和交通很发达。当时有水陆两条航路，都通达巴格达。由上述历史记载来看，中伊两国人民的友好往来关系约有两千年的历史了。只有在帝国主义侵略势力入侵两个国家之后，这种关系才中断了。随着两个国家革命的成功，这种关系很自然地又得到了恢复和发展。在伊拉克共和国成立后的最初几天，两国即相互承认并迅速建立了外交关系。在短短一年当中，我们两国之间的政治、经济和文化关系有了很快的发展，特别两国相互派出各种代表团进行友好访问，进一步地促进两国人民之间的友好和合作。在两国建交不久，伊拉克人民友好访华团、文化代表团、和社会活动家及学生代表团来我国进行了访问，在他们访问期间，中国人民在北京成立了中伊友好协会。去年12月中国贸易代表团访问了伊拉克，并签订了中伊贸易和支付协定。以后我国学生和妇女代表团应邀参加了伊拉克学生和妇女代表大会。今年3月间，中国文化代表团应伊拉克政府的邀请，在伊拉克进行了友好访问，并签订了两国的文化合作协定。中国文化代表团在访伊期间，伊拉克人民在巴格达成立了伊中友协。目前，我国政府代表团正在参加庆祝伊拉克革命一周年纪念日。通过这一系列的活动，两国人民之间的友好关系得到了进一步的发展。
    伊拉克共和国成立后，根据万隆精神，奉行和平中立政策，积极发展与和平友好国家的关系。这些措施赢得了全世界爱好和平国家和人民的支持，提高了自己的国际威望。伊拉克革命的成功，就意味着帝国主义的一个重大失败，帝国主义和反动派们无时无刻不在处心积虑地企图摧毁这一新的共和国。伊拉克共和国在卡塞姆总理的领导下，倚靠人民的支持，粉碎了敌人多次的侵略和颠覆活动，人民受到了进一步的锻炼。尽管帝国主义和反动派们仍在进行新的阴谋手段，但是有着对帝国主义斗争经验的伊拉克人民，只要继续提高警惕，加强团结，坚持斗争，帝国主义和反动派的任何阴谋是注定要失败的。伊拉克人民在反对帝国主义维护民族独立和建设自己的国家中，可以期望得到中国人民坚决的支持！中伊两国人民的友谊万古长青！
