Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, July 20th: The Second Plenary Meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region passed the "Resolution on Implementing Democratic Reform" on July 17th. The full text is as follows:

    The Second Plenary Meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region fully agrees with the reports of Acting Chairman Panchen Erdeni, Vice Chairman Zhang Guohua, and Vice Chairman Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme. The meeting unanimously believes that Tibet's social system is a reactionary, dark, cruel, and barbaric feudal serf system. Only by implementing democratic reform can we liberate the Tibetan people, develop Tibet's economy and culture, and lay the foundation for building a prosperous and happy socialist Tibet. The Central People's Government and the original Tibetan local government already adopted a positive attitude towards implementing democratic reform in Tibet in the 1951 Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet. However, for the past eight years, the original Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique have obstructed and sabotaged the implementation of the agreement in order to maintain their feudal rule, so that the task of democratic reform has not been realized.

    For the past eight years, the Central Government has adopted a patient education and waiting attitude towards the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet. However, they have shown no remorse and have instead intensified their actions, launching an armed rebellion on March 10, 1959, betraying the motherland, betraying the people, and undermining national unity. With the rapid suppression of the rebellion, they suffered a shameful defeat, prompting the Tibetan situation to enter a new stage of democratic reform. On the one hand, the nests of the rebel forces have been destroyed, and the upper-class reactionary clique's crimes of betraying the country and harming the people have been deeply resented by the broad masses, leaving them completely isolated among the people; the reactionary original Tibetan local government has been dissolved. On the other hand, the broad working people have risen up to resolutely demand democratic reform, patriotic and progressive upper-class figures actively support reform, and a large number of local Tibetan cadres are growing. The above shows that the conditions for implementing democratic reform in Tibet are ripe.

    The current central task in Tibet is to thoroughly eliminate the remaining rebel elements, fully mobilize the masses, and implement democratic reform throughout the region. The meeting believes that the central government's policy of adopting a peaceful approach to democratic reform in Tibet, that is, adopting a policy of redemption for the land and other means of production of the landlords who did not participate in the rebellion, and carrying out consultations from top to bottom and mobilizing the masses from bottom to top, is completely correct.

    According to the actual situation in Tibet, the implementation of democratic reform should be divided into two steps: first, fully mobilize the masses and vigorously carry out the movement against rebellion, against the Ula corvée system, against enslavement, and for rent reduction and interest reduction, in order to lay the foundation for the next step of land distribution.

    In order to accomplish the above tasks, the meeting unanimously believes that the following policies must be implemented currently:

    1. In agricultural areas, the land of the three major estate-holders (including their agents) who participated in the rebellion shall be subject to "whoever cultivates it, harvests it"; the land leased by the three major estate-holders (including their agents) who did not participate in the rebellion shall be subject to a "two-eight" rent reduction. At the same time, Langsheng (Xinhua News Agency editor's note: Langsheng refers to the serfs of Tibetan feudal lords, who serve the serf owners for life and are serfs for generations, without personal freedom.) should be liberated, personal dependence should be abolished, and the relationship should be changed to an employer-employee relationship. All debts owed by the three major estate-holders to the working people before 1958 shall be abolished; interest shall be reduced on debts owed by landlords who did not participate in the rebellion to the working people in 1959.

    2. In pastoral areas, in order to protect and develop livestock, eliminate rebel elements, and quickly stabilize social order, it is necessary to rely on herdsmen and working herders, and unite all forces that can be united. The livestock of the herd owners who did not participate in the rebellion shall still belong to the original herd owners; the livestock of the lords who participated in the rebellion shall still be grazed by the original herders, and the income shall belong to the herders. At the same time, a policy of mutual benefit for herdsmen and herd owners shall be implemented to reduce the exploitation of herd owners and increase the income of herders. The debt problem in pastoral areas shall be handled in accordance with the methods in agricultural areas.

    3. Freedom of religious belief should be protected, and patriotic and law-abiding temples and historical relics should be protected, which must be continuously implemented during the democratic reform. A three-anti movement against rebellion, against feudal privileges, and against the exploitative system must be carried out in temples. A redemption policy shall be implemented for the land and other means of production of patriotic and law-abiding temples. The lives of lamas shall be arranged by the government in a unified manner, and subsidies shall be provided when the income of the temples is not sufficient for legitimate expenditures.

    Fully mobilizing the masses is the key to realizing the "three-anti" and "double reduction" and democratic reform. In the process of work, it is necessary to rely on poor and lower-middle peasants, consolidate unity with middle peasants, unite all who can be united, resolutely strike at rebel elements and reactionary elements who resist democratic reform, completely abolish the feudal serf system, and organize peasant (herdsman) associations on the basis of thoroughly mobilizing the masses. During the period of democratic reform, peasant (herdsman) associations below the district level shall exercise the functions of basic rural political power.

    In accordance with the above policies, the articles of association of the Farmers' Association, the simple rules for rent reduction and interest reduction, and the plan for adjusting administrative divisions and other documents shall be promulgated separately by this committee.

    This meeting is a historically significant meeting in Tibet. The tasks before us are great and arduous. The monks and lay people of Tibet must unite under the leadership of the Party, work hard, and strive to build a democratic and socialist new Tibet.

### 西藏自治区筹委会第二次全体会议  关于进行民主改革的决议

    西藏自治区筹委会第二次全体会议
    关于进行民主改革的决议
    新华社拉萨20日电　西藏自治区筹备委员会第二次全体委员会议7月17日通过了“关于进行民主改革的决议”，全文如下：
    西藏自治区筹备委员会第二次全体委员会议完全同意班禅额尔德尼代理主任委员、张国华副主任委员和阿沛·阿旺晋美副主任委员的报告。会议一致认为：西藏的社会制度是一个反动的、黑暗的、残酷的、野蛮的封建农奴制度，只有实现民主改革，才能解放西藏人民，发展西藏的经济和文化，为建设繁荣幸福的社会主义的西藏奠定基础。西藏地方应该实行民主改革，早在1951年中央人民政府和原西藏地方政府签订的和平解放西藏办法协议中，就已经采取了肯定的态度。但是，八年以来，由于原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团为了保持其封建统治，对执行协议进行了多方阻挠和破坏，致使民主改革的任务未能付诸实现。
    八年来，中央一直对西藏上层反动集团采取了耐心教育和等待的态度，他们却毫无悔改，反而变本加厉，竟于1959年3月10日发动了背叛祖国、背叛人民、破坏民族团结的武装叛乱。随着叛乱迅速平定，他们遭到可耻的失败，促使西藏形势进入了一个民主改革的新阶段。一方面是：叛乱武装的巢穴已经摧毁，上层反动集团的卖国害民的罪恶行为已为广大群众所痛恨，他们在群众中完全陷于孤立的境地；反动的原西藏地方政府已经解散；另一方面是：广大的劳动人民起来坚决要求进行民主改革，爱国进步的上层人士积极赞成改革，本地藏族干部大量地在成长。以上说明了在西藏实现民主改革的条件已经成熟。
    当前西藏的中心任务是：彻底肃清残余的叛乱分子，充分发动群众，在全区实行民主改革。会议认为中央对西藏进行民主改革采取和平的方针，即在改革中，对于未参加叛乱的领主的土地和其它生产资料采取赎买政策和自上而下的进行协商、自下而上的发动群众的方法，是完全正确的。
    根据西藏地区的实际情况，实现民主改革应当分为两步走：首先是充分发动群众，大力开展反对叛乱、反对乌拉差役制度、反对奴役和进行减租减息的运动，为下一步分配土地打下基础。
    为了完成上述任务，会议一致认为当前必须贯彻执行以下各项政策：
    一、在农业区，对于参加叛乱的三大领主
  （包括其代理人）的土地实行“谁种谁收”；对于未参加叛乱的三大领主（包括其代理人）出租的土地实行“二、八”减租。同时，应解放朗生（新华社编者按：朗生就是西藏封建领主的家奴，终身为农奴主服劳役，并且世世代代为家奴，没有人身的自由。）废除人身依附，改为雇工关系。对于三大领主1958年以前放给劳动人民的债务，一律废除；未参加叛乱的领主在1959年放给劳动人民的债务，实行减息。
    二、在牧业区，为了保护和发展牲畜；肃清叛乱分子，迅速地安定社会秩序，必须依靠牧工和劳动牧民，团结一切可以团结的力量。对于没有参加叛乱的牧主的牲畜，仍归原牧主所有；对于参加叛乱的领主的牲畜，仍由原放牧的牧民放牧，收入归放牧的牧民所有。同时实行牧工、牧主两利政策，减少牧主的剥削，增加牧民的收入。牧区的债务问题，按农业区办法处理。
    三、保护宗教信仰自由，保护爱国守法的寺庙和有历史意义的文物古迹，在民主改革当中，必须继续贯彻执行。在寺庙中必须开展反对叛乱、反对封建特权、反对剥削制度的三反运动。对于爱国守法的寺庙的土地和其它生产资料，实行赎买政策。对于喇嘛的生活，由政府统筹安排，寺庙的收入不够正当开支时，采取补贴的办法予以解决。
    充分的发动群众是实现“三反”“双减”和民主改革的关键。在工作的过程中必须依靠贫雇农，巩固地团结中农和团结一切可以团结的人，坚决打击叛乱分子和抗拒民主改革的反动分子，彻底废除封建农奴制度，在深入发动群众的基础上，组织农（牧）民协会。区以下农（牧）民协会在民主改革期间，代行农村基层政权职能。
    根据以上各项政策，制定农民协会组织章程，减租减息简则以及行政区划调整方案等文件，由本委员会另行公布。
    这次会议是西藏具有历史意义的一次会议。摆在我们面前的任务是伟大的，艰巨的。西藏僧俗人民必须在党的领导下，团结一致，努力工作，为建设民主的和社会主义的新西藏而奋斗。
