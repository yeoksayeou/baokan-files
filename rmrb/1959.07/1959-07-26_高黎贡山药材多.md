    Many Medicinal Herbs in Gaoligong Mountain
    (Our report) The Tengchong County in Yunnan Province has organized a medicinal herb survey team to explore the natural treasure house of Gaoligong Mountain, discovering a large number of valuable medicinal materials.
    Tengchong County is located at the foot of the Gaoligong Mountain and is very rich in medicinal materials. In order to ascertain the sources of medicinal materials, the County Bureau of Commerce and the County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, with the cooperation of the communes, recently organized a medicinal herb survey team of more than ninety people, and divided them into three groups to conduct a survey of the Gaoligong Mountain within the county. They have successively discovered more than 3,000 mu of Chinese goldthread, more than 30,000 trees of Magnolia officinalis (which can produce more than 4 million jin), and more than 20,000 jujube trees. Gastrodia elata, which is of high economic value, used to rely on supplies from other places, but this time more than 1,000 mu were discovered. It was previously thought that Dendrobium nobile did not grow locally, but in fact, it grows in patches, estimated to be 20,000 to 30,000 plants. It was previously thought that Codonopsis pilosula had been completely dug up, but this time more than 1,000 mu were discovered. In addition, more than 20 kinds of relatively valuable medicinal materials such as Polygonatum odoratum, Aconitum carmichaelii, and Fritillaria cirrhosa have been discovered, and the quantities are very large.
    Now, the communes near Gaoligong Mountain are drawing people to go up the mountain to collect and dig, and at the same time, professional teams are organized to be responsible for transplantation, turning wild medicinal materials into domestic medicinal materials. At present, 459 mu of Chinese goldthread and 126 Magnolia officinalis trees have been transplanted.

    高黎贡山药材多
    本报讯　云南腾冲县组织药材普查队踏查高黎贡山天然宝库，发现大批的贵重药材。
    腾冲县地处高黎贡山山麓，药材非常丰富。为了查清药源，最近县商业局、县供销社在公社的配合下组织了九十多人的药材普查队，分三路对县境内的高黎贡山作了踏查。他们先后发现了黄连三千多亩，厚朴三万多棵（可产四百多万斤），枣树二万多株。经济价值很高的天麻，过去这里依靠外地供给，这次发现了一千多亩。过去以为当地不出产石枫丹，其实是成片的生长着，估计有二、三万棵。党参过去以为挖完了，这次又发现了一千多亩。此外还发现了玉竹参、草乌、贝母等较贵重的药材二十多种，数量都很大。
    现在，高黎贡山附近各公社正抽人上山采挖，同时还组织了专业队负责移植，把野生药材变为家种药材。目前已移植黄连四百五十九亩，紫油厚朴一百二十六棵。
