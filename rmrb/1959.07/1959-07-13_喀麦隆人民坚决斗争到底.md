    The People of Cameroon are Determined to Fight to the End
    Ernest Ouandié, Vice-President of the Cameroon People's Union
    The All-African People's Conference held in Accra in December 1958 was an event of great significance in the African national liberation struggle. It is only natural that national movements have sprung up all over Africa in the wake of the All-African People's Conference. The special significance of this conference is that it conveyed a message of hope to some regions that have long been out of touch with the progress of the African people's struggle for freedom. The climax of the national movement and the flames ignited by Accra prompted the peaceful and brave people of the Congo to take action, while the colonialists' newspapers have always regarded the people of the Congo as "smart big children." The people of Mozambique and Angola have also launched an anti-colonialist struggle. This is a serious warning to the Portuguese colonial rulers. The colonial rulers should understand that Africa is not a part of Europe and must abandon the illusion of treating Portuguese African territories as "Portuguese provinces." The climax of the national movement has also spread to Kenya and Nyasaland. In short, enslaved Africa has begun to move. It is striving to break the shackles of colonialism and stand strong.
    The struggle of the Cameroonian people for national unity and independence is an integral part of the entire African struggle.
    It was hoped that the Trusteeship Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, held in New York in February 1959, would end the political crisis that has been occurring in Cameroon since May 1955. However, the United Nations debate did not produce any concrete results. The United Nations would rather help the colonial countries and let the colonized people suffer from violent persecution. How should the failure of the United Nations be explained? It turns out that the logic followed by the majority of this international organization is the logic of imperialism.
    Cameroon's economic potential is noteworthy. Its strategic position is most valued by the military strategists of the North Atlantic Group when planning aggression. When the call for Cameroon's independence rose, the US government and its Atlantic Group partners, in order to turn Africa into a military base and separate the people of the Middle East from the people of the Maghreb, demanded a climate of "political security." They urgently need Cameroon's leaders to be obedient and not cause them any difficulties. France has gained a foothold by relying on the army and the group of active figures like Ahidjo (the current Prime Minister of the Cameroonian colonial government). It is for this reason that Ahidjo does not have the support of the people.
    The US delegation exerted various pressures on other national delegations, attempting to create divisions within the African Group. The US delegation, taking advantage of its obedient majority, forcibly passed its proposal, believing that the Ahidjo government was a "representative" government.
    Perhaps some people naively believe that the Cameroonian people would approve of the resolutions made by the United Nations, which are not in line with the interests of the Cameroonian people at all and make the Cameroonian people suffer under the rule of dictators. The Cameroonian people have decided to carry the struggle to the end until true independence is guaranteed.
    In a speech in the Yaoundé Parliament in April this year, Ahidjo mentioned "the discovery of a conspiracy threatening national security" and said that "in some areas, the riots have expanded." What Mr. Ahidjo calls "conspiracy" and "expanded riots" are in fact the Cameroonian people's resistance to the oppression of the colonialists. Despite the fascist measures taken by the puppet government, the momentum of resistance is growing. The Ahidjo government, relying on the privileges it obtained from the parliament, quickly took the following actions to suppress Cameroonian patriots:
    1. Formulate so-called "security measures";
    2. Prohibit the free passage of cars and other vehicles;
    3. Order the surrender of weapons, ammunition, and radios to the authorities, establish an inspection system, and confiscate inspected letters;
    4. Prohibit gatherings and the publication of publications;
    5. Prohibit past "political prisoners" and mobile figures without fixed residences from entering the declared emergency areas of the country.
    The local responsible authorities were also ordered to set up special criminal courts to "try" all arrested patriots, impose the death penalty, and deprive them of their right of appeal.
    In addition, the puppet government also formulated laws and arranged for Cameroon to join the "French Community." According to a decree passed in May 1959, the airports of Douala, Kribi, Sanaga, Koumton, Malimba, and Dipombali were incorporated into France's "private property." This decree also sold out Cameroon's independence, stipulating that Cameroon's foreign activities should be represented by France. According to the agreement reached in secret negotiations between de Gaulle and Ahidjo, the French government agreed to lend 30 billion francs to the Cameroonian government. In this way, Cameroon is closely linked to France economically.
    Obviously, if this group of people continues to be in power, the United Nations resolution and France's agreement to "independence" in 1960 will not be truly achieved. However, the Cameroonian people are full of confidence in the future of the struggle, because we have the support of all progressive mankind. The clouds are about to dissipate, and all attempts by imperialists to alienate Cameroonian patriots from the African people will be in vain. The joint communiqué signed by the heads of state of Ghana and Guinea on May 9 endorsed the special resolution of the emergency meeting of the General Affairs Committee of the All-African People's Conference in Conakry in April, and included the Cameroonian issue in diplomatic documents. All African countries attach great importance to this joint communiqué. The unity of African countries has greatly encouraged all African people. Soon, the Cameroonian issue will be discussed again at the United Nations. In order to better carry out the struggle, the African people will once again observe and judge who is dividing the African people. As for the African people, with the support of all progressive mankind, they will not waver in the slightest.

    喀麦隆人民坚决斗争到底
    喀麦隆人民联盟副主席　欧内斯特·乌安迪
    1958年12月在阿克拉举行的非洲人民大会，是非洲民族解放斗争中具有重大意义的事件。紧接着非洲人民大会，非洲各地民族运动风起云涌，这是十分自然的事情。这次会议的特殊意义，就是它把希望的信息传达到长久以来与非洲人民争取自由的进展脱节的一些地区。民族运动的高潮、阿克拉燃起的火焰，促使和平而勇敢的刚果人民采取了行动，而殖民者的报纸一直把刚果人民看作是“聪明的大孩子的”。莫三鼻给和安哥拉的人民也展开了反殖民主义斗争。这对葡萄牙殖民统治者说来，是严重的警告。殖民统治者应该理解：非洲不是欧洲的一个部分，必须抛弃把葡属非洲领地当作“葡萄牙省份”的那种幻想。民族运动高潮也波及怯尼亚和尼亚萨兰。总之，被束缚的非洲已经开始行动了。它力求打破殖民主义的枷锁，坚强地站立起来。
    喀麦隆人民争取国家统一与独立的斗争，是非洲整个斗争的一环。
    人们本来希望1959年2月在纽约举行的联大托管委员会能够结束喀麦隆自从1955年5月以来所发生的政治危机。可是联合国的辩论没有产生任何具体的结果。联合国宁愿帮助殖民国家、让殖民地人民遭受暴力的迫害。联合国的失败应如何解释呢？原来，这个国际机构的大多数所遵循的逻辑是帝国主义的逻辑。
    喀麦隆在经济上的潜力是引人注意的。它的战略地位最为北大西洋集团军事家在策划侵略计划时所重视。当喀麦隆独立呼声兴起时，美国政府和它的大西洋集团伙伴们，为了把非洲变为军事基地、分隔中东人民与马格里布人民，就要求保证一种“政治安全”的气候。它们迫切地需要喀麦隆的领袖们唯命是听、不给它们造成任何困难。法国凭借军队、凭借阿希乔（现任喀麦隆殖民政府总理）这一帮活跃的人物，已经获得了一个立足点。正是这个原故，阿希乔得不到人民的支持。
    美国代表团向其他国家的代表团施加了各种压力，企图造成非洲集团内部的分裂。美国代表团利用听命于它的大多数，强行通过了它的提案，认为阿希乔政府是“有代表性”的政府。
    也许有人天真地认为喀麦隆人民会赞成联合国所作出的决议，这些决议与喀麦隆人民的利益丝毫不相符合，它使喀麦隆人民遭受独裁者的统治。喀麦隆人民却决定要把斗争进行到底，直到真正的独立有了保障。
    今年4月，阿希乔在雅温得议会中的一次演说里提到“发现威胁国家安全的一项阴谋”，又说“在若干地区里，骚乱扩大了。”阿希乔先生所谓的“阴谋”、“骚乱扩大了”，事实上是喀麦隆人民对殖民者的压迫所进行的抵抗。尽管傀儡政府采取了法西斯措施，抵抗的声势却愈来愈大了。阿希乔政府凭借它从议会获得的特权，迅速采取了下列行动以镇压喀麦隆的爱国者：
    一、制订所谓“保安措施”；
    二、禁止汽车和其他车辆自由通行；
    三、下令向当局交出武器、军火、无线电，设立检查制度、没收被检查的信件；
    四、禁止集会和发行刊物；
    五、禁止过去的“政治犯”以及没有固定住所的活动人物进入国家所宣布的紧急地区。
    地方的负责当局并接奉命令设立特别刑庭，对所有的被捕的爱国者进行“审判”、处以死刑、并褫夺其上诉权。
    此外，傀儡政府还制定法律，布置喀麦隆加入“法兰西共同体”。根据1959年5月通过的一项法令，杜阿拉、克立毕、萨纳加、库姆顿、马利姆巴、狄波姆巴立的飞机场，被并为法国的“私产”。这项法令还出卖了喀麦隆的独立，规定喀麦隆的对外活动由法国来代表。依照戴高乐与阿希乔秘密谈判所取得的协议，法国政府同意对喀麦隆政府贷款三百亿法郎。这样，在经济上，喀麦隆就紧紧地与法国联在一起。
    显然，如果目前这一帮人继续执政，联合国决议、法国同意在1960年的“独立”是不会真正得到的。但是喀麦隆人民对斗争的前途充满了信心，因为我们有全体进步人类的支持。乌云即将散尽，帝国主义者离间喀麦隆爱国者与非洲人民的一切企图，均将归于无效。加纳与几内亚两国首脑5月9日共同签署的联合公报，赞助了4月间全非人民大会总务委员会科纳克里紧急会议的特别决议，并且把喀麦隆问题写入了外交文件。非洲的一切国家对这项联合公报极为重视。非洲国家的团结一致大大地鼓舞了全体非洲人民。不久，喀麦隆问题将再一次在联合国讨论。为了更好地进行斗争，非洲人民将再一次观察、判断谁在分裂非洲人民。至于在全体进步人类支持下的非洲人民，是丝毫也不动摇的。
