Why Unify the Measurement System

Commentator of this newspaper

The State Council has announced the decision to further unify China's measurement system with the international metric system, formally establishing the international metric system as China's basic measurement system, and stipulating measures and steps to further expand the scope of metric system usage. This is an important matter concerning China's economic construction and people's lives, and it is also the inevitable result of China's economic, scientific, technological, and cultural development.

Old China was a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country. Imperialists divided spheres of influence in China, manipulated China's economic lifeline, and different regions adopted different measurement systems. The reactionary ruling class's long-term feudal separatism also retained the old miscellaneous systems in various regions, making it impossible to talk about unified measurement standards and verification. Landlords and unscrupulous merchants also engaged in fraud, "using a big scale to buy in and a small scale to sell out." All of this created a very chaotic measurement system, which brought great harm to production and people's lives. The broad masses of people had hoped for a unified measurement system, and many had made numerous suggestions. However, these wishes were impossible to realize under the extremely corrupt reactionary rule.

In the early days of liberation, China began to reform the unification of measurement. First, the metric measurement system was gradually established in industrial transportation, scientific research, and other departments. Especially in the large-scale enterprises that the Soviet Union helped China build, the unified metric system was used in technical equipment, design drawings, and measuring instruments. The original enterprises also promoted the metric system through technological transformation. Private enterprises also gradually switched to the metric system through national processing orders and the socialist transformation in 1956. On the other hand, through the development of China's state-owned commerce and the implementation of the state's unified purchase and sales work, the market system based on the metric system was also widely promoted in commodity circulation and agricultural product distribution. Measurement verification agencies have been established in various regions, and commonly used measuring instruments have basically met the requirements. However, this work was carried out separately by various regions and departments, and the measurement systems of some departments have not yet been unified, and there is also a lack of unified and accurate measurement benchmarks. With the development of socialist construction, the need for a unified measurement system has become more urgent. Especially in large-scale industrial production, the specifications of raw materials must be unified, equipment must be matched, and production must be coordinated. Without a unified measurement system and accurate measurement values, production cannot proceed smoothly, and the safety and quality of production cannot be guaranteed. In commerce, the inconsistency of the measurement system will cause great trouble. Repeated conversions not only waste manpower and time, but also easily lead to errors, causing losses to work. In the purchase and sale of agricultural products and people's lives, inconsistent measurements will cause millions of people to unnecessarily waste a lot of energy and time. As for scientific and technological research, it requires unified and accurate measurement. In short, industry, agriculture, commerce, learning, and the military all need unified and accurate measurement.

The international metric system is the product of modern industrial and scientific development and meets the requirements of modern science and technology. It uses a decimal system, which is very convenient for calculation, and is much better than the imperial system and the sixteen-binary old market system. The international metric system has been adopted by most countries in the world, and especially socialist countries also use the metric system. Therefore, further unifying China's measurement system with the international metric system is also very necessary for economic, technological, and cultural cooperation and exchange. China's socialist construction is leaping forward, and the economic ties between regions and departments are increasingly strengthened. Further unification of the measurement system will be more conducive to the development of the national economy. Therefore, after a long period of active preparation and repeated publicity and use, it is necessary and timely to announce this reform now. It is stipulated to expand the scope of use of the metric system on the existing basis; unify the measurement names of the metric system; eliminate the use of the imperial system and all other old miscellaneous systems except for special circumstances where they must be used; and on the basis of retaining the continued use of the market system, change the market catty to the decimal system (but prescriptions for traditional Chinese medicine still use the old system). These measures not only meet the needs of national construction and scientific and cultural development, but also are a consistent requirement of people's lives, and will bring huge effects in saving manpower and promoting production.

Although there has been long-term preparation, it is not a simple matter to fully implement unified and accurate measurement among 600 million people. We must first carry out extensive publicity and popularization work. Make the advantages of the metric system and the knowledge required to use the metric system known to every household. At the same time, the promulgation and adoption of a measurement system based on the international metric system is only the first step in this work. If the measurement is not accurate, the unification will become empty talk. Therefore, we must vigorously strengthen measurement work in order to adapt to the needs of China's production construction and scientific and cultural development.

The key to ensuring accurate measurement lies in the widespread use of various measuring instruments and the adoption of a series of measures to ensure the consistency, accuracy, and correct use of measuring instruments. At the same time, it is also necessary to continuously conduct research, improve existing measurement technology, and adopt new and more complete measurement methods. In the past few years, the production and supply of measuring instruments have greatly developed, and specialized measurement institutions have been established in various places. The verification and management of measuring instruments have achieved great results, and should be developed more quickly on this basis to meet the growing and increasingly high needs. In order to ensure the consistency, accuracy, and correct use of measuring instruments used by various departments of the national economy, especially industrial, agricultural, and transportation departments, it is also necessary to establish a unified measurement network nationwide. We should start to establish and improve China's highest-level measurement benchmarks, establish measurement standards for various regions and departments, improve the measurement management system based on regions, strengthen regional measurement institutions at all levels and enterprise measurement organizations, and make full use of existing manpower and material resources to carry out systematic verification and management work. At the same time, we should also fully value the measurement work in agricultural production, agricultural product distribution, and commercial departments.

Measurement is an indispensable link in production. In carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement centered on technological innovation and technological revolution, strengthening measurement work is also an important technical measure for achieving high quality and high yield and improving labor productivity. Ignoring measurement work at any time will reduce product quality, affect coordination and matching, and cause losses to production. We must seriously treat the unity and accuracy of measurement work, give the necessary support to the equipment and conditions necessary for measurement work, and make measurement work more closely integrated with production to serve production.

To carry out measurement work, the most basic working method is the mass line. Measurement is carried out through the specific mastery of the broad masses of workers and staff in the production process and various economic activities. Therefore, we must adopt the policy of combining popularization and improvement, mobilize the masses, and vigorously carry out measurement work. Use existing technology and material conditions to quickly carry out grassroots measurement work, and on the basis of popularization, continuously improve according to the different requirements of production technology to ensure the accuracy of measurement. We believe that as long as we resolutely rely on the leadership of the Party, rely on the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of people, work with a scientific attitude, and adopt the policy of combining popularization and improvement, measurement work will inevitably be carried out more rapidly and make greater achievements to better serve socialist construction.

    为什么要统一计量制度
    本报评论员
    国务院公布了关于以国际公制进一步统一我国计量制度的决定，正式确定国际公制为我国的基本计量制度，并且规定了进一步扩大公制使用范围的措施和步骤。这是有关我国经济建设和人民生活的一件重要事情。也是我国经济、科学技术和文化发展的必然结果。
    旧中国是一个半封建半殖民地的国家，帝国主义者在我国划分势力范围，操纵我国的经济命脉，不同的地方采用了不同的计量制度；而反动统治阶级长期的封建割据，又保留了各个地方的旧有的杂制，根本谈不到什么统一的计量标准和检定。地主、奸商又弄虚作假，“大秤进、小秤出”。凡此种种，就形成了计量制度十分混乱的局面，给生产和人民生活带来了很大的损害。广大人民虽曾十分希望统一计量制度，许多人都曾提过不少的建议。但是，这些愿望在腐败透顶的反动统治之下，根本不可能实现。
    解放初期我国就开始了统一计量的改革工作。首先在工业交通、科学研究等部门逐步建立了公制的计量系统，特别是在苏联帮助我国建立的大型企业中，在技术装备、设计图纸、计量器具等方面都一律采用了统一的公制；原有企业通过技术改造，也推行了公制；私营企业通过国家加工订货和1956年的社会主义改造也逐步改用公制。另一方面，通过我国国营商业的发展以及国家统购统销工作的实行，在商品流通和农业产品分配等方面，也普遍推行了以公制为基础的市制，并在各个地区建立了度量衡检定机构，一般使用的计量器具已经基本上符合要求。但是，这些工作是由各地方、各部门分头进行的，有些部门的计量制度还未统一，而且也缺乏统一而准确的计量基准。随着社会主义建设的发展，统一计量制度的需要就更加迫切了。特别是在大工业生产中，原材料的规格要统一，设备要配套，生产要协作，如果没有统一的计量制度、准确的计量数值，生产就不能顺利进行，生产的安全和质量也不能得到保证。在商业中计量制度的不统一，会造成很大的麻烦，反复换算，不仅浪费人力、时间，而且容易发生差错，给工作带来损失。在农业产品的购销、人民生活方面，计量不统一将造成千百万人不必要地耗费掉许多精力和时间。至于科学技术研究工作，更需要统一、准确的计量。总之，工、农、商、学、兵，各行各业，都需要统一的准确的计量。
    国际公制是近代工业和科学发展的产物，符合近代科学技术的要求；它采用十进位，计算十分方便，比起英制和十六进位的旧市制好得多。国际公制已为世界大多数国家所采用，特别是社会主义阵营国家也都是采用公制。因此以国际公制进一步地统一我国的计量制度，对经济、技术和文化的合作交流也是十分必要的。我国社会主义建设正在向前跃进，各地区、各部门之间的经济联系日益加强，计量制度进一步的统一将会更有利于国民经济的发展。因此，经过长期的积极准备，并反复宣传、使用之后，现在公布这个改革是必要的，也是适时的。规定在现有基础上扩大公制的使用范围；统一公制的计量名称；除了特殊情况必须使用外，取消英制和一切其他旧杂制的使用；在保留市制继续使用的基础上，改市斤为十进制（但中医处方用药则仍用旧制）。这些措施不仅符合国家建设和科学文化发展的需要，而且也是群众生活上的一致要求，将在节省人力、促进生产方面，带来巨大的效果。
    虽然有了长期工作的准备，但是在六亿人口中，全面地实行统一的、准确的计量，毕竟不是一件简单的事情，必须首先进行广泛的宣传和普及工作。把公制的优点和使用公制需具备的知识，做到家喻户晓。同时，公布和采用以国际公制为基础的计量制度，只是这个工作的一个首要环节，如果计量不准确，统一就成为空谈，因此，必须大力加强计量工作，才能适应我国生产建设和科学文化发展的需要。
    保证计量准确的关键在于广泛地使用各种计量器具，并采取一系列的措施来保证计量器具的一致准确与正确使用。同时，还需要不断地进行研究，提高现有计量技术和采用新的更加完善的计量方法。几年来，计量器具的生产供应有了很大发展，各地先后建立了专门的计量机构，计量器具的检定管理工作取得很大成绩，应该在这个基础上更快地发展，才能满足日益增长、日益提高的需要。为了保证国民经济各部门、特别是工农业交通部门所使用计量器具的一致准确和正确使用，还必须在全国范围内，建立一个统一的计量网。应该着手建立和健全我国最高级的计量基准器，建立各地区各部门的计量标准器，健全以地区为主的计量管理体制，加强地区各级计量机构以及企业计量组织，充分利用现有人力物力开展有系统的检定管理工作。同时，还应充分重视农业生产、农产品分配以及商业部门的计量工作。
    计量是生产中一个不可缺少的环节。在开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动中，要优质高产，提高劳动生产率，加强计量工作也是一个重要的技术措施。任何时候忽视计量工作，都会降低产品质量，影响协作配套，给生产带来损失。必须认真地对待计量工作的统一性和准确性，对计量工作所必需的设备和条件给以应有的支持，并使计量工作更密切地结合生产，为生产服务。
    要开展计量工作，最基本的工作方法是群众路线。计量是通过广大职工群众在生产过程中和各种经济活动中具体掌握进行的，因此，必须采取普及和提高相结合的方针，发动群众，大力开展计量工作。利用现有的技术和物质条件，把基层计量工作迅速地开展起来，并且在普及的基础上，根据生产技术不同的要求，不断地提高，以保证计量的准确性。我们相信，只要坚决依靠党的领导，依靠广大群众的积极性和创造性，用科学的态度来做工作，采取普及和提高相结合的方针，计量工作就必然能够更加迅速地开展，作出更大的成绩，为社会主义建设更好地服务。
