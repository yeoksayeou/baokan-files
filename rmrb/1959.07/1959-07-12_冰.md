    Ice disappears in the summer, vanishing without a trace. It first melts into water, then turns into vapor, escaping in a flurry. But it is precisely because ice bravely destroys itself that it brings many benefits to people. This is because when ice melts, it takes away a large amount of heat from the surrounding objects.
    Ice has been serving people for at least three thousand years. The "Book of Songs," "Binfeng," says: "On the second day, they chisel ice with a rushing sound; on the third day, they put it in the ice cellar." The so-called "ice cellar" is also known as an "ice room." According to the "Book of Rites," during the Zhou Dynasty, there was even a special organization to manage ice cellars, and the person in charge was called "Ling Ren" (Ice Official).
    After the Qin and Han dynasties, the application of ice gradually expanded. Cao Zhi of the Wei Dynasty said in his "Ode to the Great Heat": "Accumulate white ice in secluded halls, the air flies and condenses into frost," which clearly shows that ice was already being used to regulate indoor temperature at this time. In Chang'an during the Tang Dynasty, people commonly used natural ice to make "iced cool water," and those who were more particular added sugar and mung beans to the ice.
    As the uses of ice gradually expanded, natural ice could no longer adequately meet people's needs, so people began to consider using artificial methods to make it.
    It is said that the ancient Egyptians already knew how to make ice. They put clear water in shallow dishes and placed them in the open air. If the weather was dry and windy, the water in the dishes would evaporate quickly, absorbing a large amount of heat, and a thin layer of ice would often appear on the remaining water. The ancient Greeks went a step further by storing water in large bottles, placing them in a well-ventilated place, and sprinkling water on the outside of the bottles day and night. In this way, the heat absorption effect of water evaporation was stronger, so the possibility of forming ice was greater. Although these can be regarded as the earliest artificial ice-making methods, the output was too small. Truly valuable artificial ice was first made in our country. Long ago, there was a type of "ice-fresh ship" in our country, and some of the ice carried on these ships was artificial ice. In the early Yuan Dynasty, the Italian Marco Polo came to China and introduced our ice-making methods to Europe.
    In the nineteenth century, absorption refrigerators and compression refrigerators, which use ammonia, sulfur dioxide, and other substances to absorb a large amount of heat during evaporation, were successively invented, and the manufacture of artificial ice began to develop rapidly.
    Using ice to freeze food is still one of the most important uses of ice. Now that there are cold foods like ice cream and popsicles, it seems unnecessary to eat pure ice anymore. However, workers in high-temperature workshops and those involved in lifting, loading, and unloading still need to eat ice in combination to quench their thirst and relieve the heat.
    Using ice to lower the indoor temperature could only be considered a luxury for the aristocracy in ancient times, but today, it has truly become an indispensable measure in people's production and labor. Laboratories in steel factories, workshops where injections are sealed in pharmaceutical factories, ... all need to use it. This is both to ensure the quality of the products and to prevent workers from suffering heatstroke.
    Ice is frozen water, but it is cleverly used by people to make houses and warehouses. In 1740, St. Petersburg built an ice house. Around 1939, Moscow saw the world's first ice-covered warehouse. After the liberation of our country, such ice warehouses were also successfully trial-produced in Harbin. This type of warehouse was first invented by the Soviet scientist Krylov.
    People have repeatedly discovered that sometimes fish have been frozen solid, but after thawing, they often become alive again. This leads people to think of using artificial methods to induce hibernation. Now, this method has already been successfully applied in medicine. During artificial hibernation, the main task of ice is to slow down blood circulation and reduce bleeding. As for using ice to help patients with high fevers reduce their temperature, and using ice to preserve serum, vaccines, and some easily flammable drugs, this is even more common.
    Ice is also essential in many industries such as glass, dyes, synthetic rubber, and rayon.

    冰

    冰到了夏天，就要消形匿迹，先化为水，再变为汽，狼狈而逃了。可是也正亏了冰的勇于毁灭自己，给人们带来了许多好处。这是因为：冰在融化的时候，会把周围物体中的热，大量地带走。
    冰为人们服务，历史至少已有三千多年。“诗经”“豳风”上说：“二之日凿冰冲冲，三之日纳于凌阴”，所谓“凌阴”，也就是“冰室”。据“周礼”一书记载，周朝时候甚至还有专门管理冰室的机构，负责管理的人叫做“凌人”。
    秦汉以后，冰的应用范围逐渐扩大。魏曹植“大暑赋”说：“积素冰于幽馆，气飞结而为霜”，则明显地表示出这时已应用冰来调节室内的气温。唐代的长安，人们还普遍地用天然冰来制造“冰雪凉水”讲究一点的则在冰雪中加沙糖，绿豆……
    冰的用途逐渐扩大，天然冰便显得不能很好地满足人们的要求，于是人们开始打算用人工的方法来制造。
    相传古埃及人已知道造冰，他们将清水盛于浅盘中，放在露天下，如果遇到天气干燥多风，盘中水分迅速蒸发，就可以吸去大量的热，而在剩余的水上面，往往能出现薄薄的一层冰。古希腊人更进一步把水贮在大瓶中，放在通风的高处，并日夜不停地在瓶外洒水，这样，水分蒸发吸热的作用更强，所以形成冰的可能性也就更大。这些虽可以算是较早的人造冰，但产量太少。真正有实用价值的人造冰，还是我国最早制造出来的。很久以前我国有一种“冰鲜船”，这种船所带的冰，有一些便是人造冰。元朝初，意大利人马哥孛罗来中国，便把我国制冰的方法传到了欧洲。
    十九世纪，利用氨气、二氧化硫等在蒸发时吸收大量热量的吸收冷冻机，压缩冷冻机相继发明，人造冰的制造，便开始有迅速的发展。
    用冰来冷冻食物，到现在还是冰的一种最主要的用途。现在有冰淇淋，冰棍之类的冷食，似乎用不着再吃纯粹的冰了。可是在高温车间工作以及起重、装卸等方面的工人，依然要结合着吃冰，才能很好地消渴解暑。
    用冰来降低室内的温度，在古代只能算是贵族阶级的奢侈，但是到了今天，却真正成为人们生产劳动中一项不可缺少的措施。钢铁厂的化验室，制药厂进行针剂封口的车间，……都需要用到它。这一方面是为了保证产品的质量，同时也为了防止工人中暑。
    冰是冻结的水，可是它却巧妙地被人们利用，制成了房屋和仓库。1740年，当时的彼得堡就建成了一所冰屋。1939年前后，莫斯科出现了世界上第一座冰盖的仓库。我国解放后，这样的冰仓库在哈尔滨市也试制成功了。这种仓库是苏联科学家克雷洛夫首先发明的。
    人们曾多次发现：有时鱼儿已冻成僵冻，但解冻后往往又会变得活生生的。这就使人联想起用人工制造冬眠的方法。现在，这方法在医学上早已成功地应用过了。在进行人工冬眠的时候，冰所担负的任务主要是和缓血液循环，使出血减少。至于利用冰来帮助高烧的病人退热，和用冰来保存血清、痘苗和一些容易燃烧的药品，更是普遍。
    在玻璃、染料、合成橡胶、人造丝等等许多工业上，也都有必需应用冰的地方。
