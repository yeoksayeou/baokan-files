Guilin is Pleasant

By our reporters Gong Chenghua and Zhao Huayuan

"All the mountains are hot, but Guilin alone is pleasant." Although Guilin is located in the south, its climate is relatively mild. More and more people are coming to Guilin now. In this ancient city, what is even more admirable is the thoughtful service of the commercial workers.

　　　　Thoughtful Service
Coming from the Guilin South Railway Station on the Xiang-Gui Railway, on the way to the city, next to the simple and elegant Shan Lake, there is a Nanmen Department Store. It has a "Convenience Counter."

If you are a passing traveler, you probably want to find a good place to stay first. The store clerks seem to have guessed your thoughts, and on a clean glass counter, there is an introduction sheet with the names, addresses, and phone numbers of the city's hotels, so you can see them at a glance. If you want to inquire about how to get to Yangshuo, "the best landscape in Guilin," there is a timetable of trains and buses from Guilin to various places, specifically for your information. Will it be sunny or rainy tomorrow? Please look up at the weather forecast sign on the wall, and you will know. Just as a grateful smile appears on your face, what if there is a clap of thunder and it suddenly starts to rain? That's okay too. The counter has rental rubber shoes and rain gear. Within twelve hours, the rental fee for shoes and umbrella is only one jiao and three fen in total.

Comrades, the convenience counter offers many conveniences! Here, stationery, envelopes, and stamps are all available, and they will send the letters to the post office for you. The counter displays thirty brands of toothpaste, as well as shoe polish, etc. You can try them before you buy them, so as not to be dissatisfied if you buy something you don't like. It's easy to get heatstroke in hot weather, and the counter also has Ten Drops of Water, Pain Relief Powder, and Baoji Pills for you to take.

Zhang Jingzhi, the Party Branch Secretary of this department store, said: "The whole store has a total of 71 ways to facilitate customers." "Who came up with such thoughtful ideas?" He said: "Everyone came up with them."

　　　　"Number Five"
Further ahead, across Yang Bridge, is the Guilin Restaurant. It faces the most beautiful place in the center of Guilin – Rong Lake. There, the trees are lush, and the winding corridors offer pleasant scenery. In the dining room of the Guilin Restaurant, poems written by customers are dazzling. One of them is: "Raise the red flag high, good service attitude, compete to see who takes the lead, Number Five is the one." Speaking of "Number Five" waitress, her deeds are very vivid.

Recently, a couple with luggage brought three children to the Guilin Restaurant for dinner. Waitress Zhou Xueqin stepped forward, took the luggage in one hand, warmly settled them down, and then poured a few cups of hot tea, smiling and said: "Comrades, please have tea!" Zhou Xueqin watched as she worked, and found that the three children's faces were dirty and their hands were black. She turned around and quickly brought a basin of warm water, washing them clean one by one. When she was busy serving other customers and turned back, she saw that it was very inconvenient for the mother of the three children to hold the baby while eating. She thought to herself, I have also raised children. Children are noisy, and I have never had a comfortable meal. At this time, there were not many customers in the hall. Zhou Xueqin stepped forward and said with a smile: "Comrade, let me hold the baby for you for a while." As she said that, she gently took the baby from the mother's arms. The baby's mother looked at Zhou Xueqin's back with gratitude and surprise. Although she showed the baby the flowers and the passing pedestrians and vehicles on the street to make him happy, the baby, who did not recognize the aunt, still fussed for his mother, pulling back and forth on Zhou Xueqin. Zhou Xueqin patted gently and coaxed patiently, like she would with her own child, and put her own ballpoint pen into the baby's hand to distract him. And just like that, the baby was playing quietly. When the child's mother was leaving, she thanked Zhou Xueqin again and again.

　　　　Relatives Everywhere
One evening in February, a young pregnant woman came to the Chu Han Inn to stay. The rooms were already full, but the waitress Jiang Rongfang thought that the woman was pregnant, alone, and it was getting late, so she said caringly: "There are no rooms, but if you don't mind, I'll let you stay in my bed." That night, although she was already over fifty years old, she only wore a cotton-padded jacket and slept on a bamboo bed with her clothes on.

Late at night, when people were already asleep, Jiang Rongfang, who had been busy all day, suddenly heard a few moans from the pregnant woman lying on the bed. She quickly asked her quietly: "Comrade, do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?" "Nothing." But after a while, she moaned softly again. Jiang Rongfang knew that she was about to give birth and asked her to go to the hospital for examination, but the pregnant woman said: "It's not time yet!" After Jiang Rongfang's detailed questioning, she finally persuaded her to go to the hospital. At this time, the night was quiet and deep, and she couldn't find a car. Jiang Rongfang braved the cold wind and supported her to the hospital step by step.

When Jiang Rongfang returned to the inn, the east was already beginning to turn white. She didn't lie down to rest, thinking that it would be so great if this girl had her own mother by her side... Thinking of this, she felt that she was her own mother, and she was her own daughter. Without even washing her face, she hurried to the hospital again.

The child was born, and she was so happy that she smiled. She hurried home again to get something for the woman to eat. When Jiang Rongfang's daughter-in-law found out, she immediately boiled the eggs that the old hen in the family had laid in the past two days and the brown sugar that she had originally made rice cakes for the child into brown sugar eggs, and asked her mother-in-law to send them quickly. Then Jiang Rongfang went to the street to buy meat and choose eggs, as happy as if she had a grandson.

After the woman was discharged from the hospital, the waitress Jiang Rongfang bought tickets for her, checked her luggage, and sent her to the station, repeatedly telling her to keep her head wrapped tightly and wear two pairs of socks after returning home.

In the stores of this city, a convenience-oriented atmosphere prevails everywhere. In the store, you can buy half an inch of cloth, or you can buy one shoe and one sock, and spend one fen to draw ink once. Because the service work is done well, in the first five months of this year, the city's commercial workers have received more than 280,000 praises from customers, which is more than 70,000 more than the whole year of last year.

    桂林宜人
    本报记者　龚成华　招华媛
    “三岭皆炎热，宜人独桂林。”桂林虽处南国，气候却较温和。现在，来往桂林的人更多了。在这座古老的名城里，更令人敬羡的是商业职工们的周到的服务工作。
              想得周到
    由湘桂铁路桂林南站下车，进城途中，在清淡朴素的杉湖旁边，有一座南门百货大楼。这里设有“便民专柜”。
    如果你是一个过往旅客，大概总先想找个好的落脚住处，这个商店的店员们好像猜透了你的心思，在一个洁净的玻璃柜上压着一张全市旅馆名称、门牌、电话号码的介绍表，让你一览无遗。假若你想打听怎样去“山水甲桂林”的阳朔，这里就有个桂林通往各地火车、汽车的时刻表，专门为你作介绍。明天天晴还是下雨？请你抬头看看墙上的天气预报牌，就会心里有数。正当你脸上泛起感激微笑的时候，要是天空一声雷响，突然下起雨来怎么办？这也没有关系，货柜里摆着出租的胶鞋和雨具，十二小时之内，连鞋带伞一共才要一角三分的租金。
    同志，便民专柜与人方便的地方多着哩！这里信笺、信封、邮票一应俱全，而且代你将信送去邮局。专柜里陈列有三十种牌子的牙膏，以及鞋油等，你可以试用后再买，以免买不到合意的东西而不满意。热天容易中暑，柜里还摆有十滴水、止痛散、保济丸，供你服用。
    这座百货大楼的党支部书记张敬芷说：“全店共有各种方便顾客的办法七十一种。”“想得这样周到，是谁想出来的？”他说：“这是大家想出来的。”
            “第五号”
    再向前走，过阳桥，就是桂林酒家。它面对桂林市中心最幽美的地方——榕湖。那里绿树成荫，回栏数转，风景宜人。在桂林酒家餐厅里，顾客写的诗歌琳琅满目。其中一首是：“红旗举得高，服务态度好，竞赛谁占先，要算第五号”。讲起“第五号”服务员，她的事迹可生动了。
    最近的一天，一对夫妻手提行李，带着三个小孩到桂林酒家吃饭。服务员周学琴走上前去，一手接过行李，热情地安顿他们坐下，随即斟上几杯热茶，笑盈盈地说道：“同志，请喝茶！”周学琴边做边看，发现三个小孩子脸脏手黑，掉过头来赶忙拿来一盆温水，一个个地帮他们洗得干干净净。当她忙着招待其他顾客转回来时，看见这三个孩子的妈妈抱着小孩吃饭很不方便，心里想起，我也带过孩子，孩子吵吵闹闹，从来没有吃过一顿舒舒服服的饭。这时，堂上顾客不多，周学琴走上前去，含笑地说：“同志，我来帮你抱一阵。”说着，就从母亲怀里把孩子轻轻地接过去，小孩的妈妈用感谢和惊奇的眼光望着周学琴的背影。尽管让孩子看花和街道上往来的行人车辆，逗他高兴，可是不认识阿姨的孩子依然闹着要他的妈妈，在周学琴身上扳来扳去。周学琴像对自己的孩子一样，轻轻地拍，耐心地哄，拿出自己的原子笔塞到孩子手里，转移他的注意，就是这样，孩子乖乖地在玩耍了。孩子的妈妈临走时，千谢万谢地感谢周学琴。
            处处有亲人
    在2月的一个傍晚，楚汉客栈来了一个年轻的孕妇投宿。客房本已住满，但是服务员蒋荣芳想到别人是孕妇，孤身在外，加上天色已晚，就关切地说：“房间是没有了，要是不嫌弃，就把我的床铺让给你住。”当晚，她自己虽已五十开外，却只穿一身棉袄，和衣睡在一张竹床上。
    深夜两点多钟，人们已经睡熟，忙了一天的蒋荣芳忽然听到躺在床上的那个孕妇几声呻吟，连忙悄声问她：“同志，你觉得哪里不舒服？”“没有什么。”可是片刻，又发出微微的呻吟声。蒋荣芳知道她将要分娩，要她到医院去检查，而那个孕妇说：“还没到时候哩！”经蒋荣芳详细地盘问后，终于动员她到医院去。这时，夜静更深，找不到车子，蒋荣芳便冒着寒风，一步挨一步地把她扶到医院。
    蒋荣芳回到客栈，东方已经开始发白，她没有再躺下休息，想着这个姑娘要是有个亲娘在她身边，那该多好……。想到这里，觉得自己就是她的亲娘，她就是自己的女儿。脸也顾不得洗，又赶忙到医院。
    小孩出世了，她乐得眉开眼笑，又急忙跑回家去，弄东西来给产妇吃。蒋荣芳的媳妇知道以后，马上把家里老母鸡这两天生的蛋和原来给孩子做米糕的红糖一起煮成红糖鸡蛋，让婆婆快送去。接着蒋荣芳又上街买肉选蛋，真像自己添了个孙子那样高兴。
    产妇出院以后，服务员蒋荣芳为她买票，托运行李，把她送到车站，一再嘱咐她回家以后头要包紧，多穿两双袜子。
    在这个城市的商店里，到处都洋溢着方便人的风气。在商店里，你可以扯半寸布，也可以买一只鞋和一只袜子，花一分钱吸一次墨水。由于服务工作做得好，今年头五个月，全市商业职工受到顾客各种表扬二十八万多次，这比去年全年还多七万多次。（附图片）
