Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 7th: 川圹(Xiangkhoang) report: According to the "Xiangkhoang Lao Patriotic News," the former Lao Fighting Forces' Second Battalion issued a letter to all the people of Laos on July 1st, comprehensively and systematically exposing the eight major crimes of the Phoui Sananikone government in violating the Geneva Accords and agreements signed by both sides of Laos, betraying national interests, acting as a running dog of the United States, and provoking domestic war. It also put forward an eight-point program for the people's struggle.

The proclamation first recalled the fact that after years of heroic resistance, the Lao people finally achieved a great victory in which the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the country were recognized in the Geneva Accords.

The proclamation stated that the Lao Patriotic Front, with national interests in mind, agreed to hand over the two provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly, demobilize most of its troops, and incorporate some of its troops into the Royal Lao Army. The Royal Government, on the other hand, guaranteed to implement a policy of peace and neutrality, establish a coalition government with representatives of the former Lao Fighting Forces, guarantee that all citizens would enjoy democratic freedoms, and guarantee that there would be no discrimination or retaliation against personnel of the former Lao Fighting Forces and former resistance personnel. Thus, after ten years of fighting, the gunfire finally ceased.

The United States conspired to turn Laos into its colony and military base, and tried every possible means to eliminate the Lao Fighting Forces. The Sananikone government tore up the Geneva Accords and surrounded the Lao Fighting Forces.

The proclamation went on to point out that the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs—a handful of Lao people who bring disaster to the country and people—did not want Laos to pursue a policy of peace, neutrality, independence, and democracy; they conspired to turn Laos into a U.S. colony and military base, and conspired to drag Laos into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc.

The proclamation said, therefore, "After the two battalions of the former Lao Fighting Forces were transferred to the Chen Ning Plain and 川银 (Xiang Nguen) to be stationed, they tried every possible means to eliminate us, so that they could steal the revolutionary fruits that our people exchanged with so much blood and sweat."

The proclamation, after recounting the intolerable persecution suffered by the two battalions of the former Lao Fighting Forces for more than a year, especially since the Phoui Sananikone government came to power, said: "On May 11th this year, after announcing the tearing up of the Geneva Accords and intensifying suppression and massacres everywhere, they thought everything was ready, so they stepped up the implementation of the above-mentioned conspiracy under the pretext of awarding 'military ranks'." The proclamation said: "They ordered us to put all our weapons in the warehouse and go empty-handed to another location to receive 'military ranks'. This location was surrounded by barbed wire, and three battalions of the fully armed Royal Army were deployed around it in advance."

The proclamation said: "Faced with their capricious conspiracy, we were very calm. We suggested a postponement of a few days so that we could consult together and reach a consensus that was in line with the spirit and provisions of the agreements that had already been signed. They rejected this legitimate proposal and immediately ordered the army to surround us, pointing their guns at our barracks and the residences of some of our families. A few days later, they announced a cutoff of supplies and demanded that if we did not obey orders, we would be charged with rebellion after twenty-four hours." The proclamation said: "We were incredibly angry at their extremely despicable breach of faith. In order to avoid fratricide, we decided to break through the encirclement."

The Second Battalion of the Lao Fighting Forces received the love and support of the people, defeated the enemy's conspiracy, preserved its strength, and the morale of the commanders and fighters was high.

The proclamation talked about the process of the Second Battalion breaking through the encirclement, saying: "Since we came to the southeast of Xiangkhoang Province to be stationed, the Royal Army has continued to carry out the civil war that they created with their own hands for nearly a month. The Royal Army continues to 'sweep' through the villages, arresting former Lao Fighting Forces personnel, raping women, plundering livestock, and preventing the people from engaging in production. Wherever they go, they create scenes of war. The people are incredibly angry at their unjust actions, so they do not cooperate with them, but stand with us to oppose them."

The proclamation said: "Today, as the sound of their attacking guns and the sound of our fighting guns continue to ring out, we are very excited and confidently tell our compatriots that we have defeated the conspiracy of the Royal Army to encircle and eliminate the Second Battalion, and have received the full love and support of the people of all ethnic groups. The strength of the former Lao Fighting Forces' Second Battalion is still preserved, and the combat emotions of the commanders and fighters are still strong. We are willing to unite closely with the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country to fight to the end to demand that the Royal Government fully implement the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, and jointly build a peaceful, neutral, independent, democratic, unified, and prosperous Laos."

The Sananikone Reactionary Clique's Eight Major Crimes

The proclamation to the entire people went on to list the eight major crimes of the Phoui Sananikone reactionary clique and the so-called "Committee for the Defense of National Interests" clique.

1. Undermining the policy of peace and neutrality, acting as a running dog of the United States.

The proclamation said, "First, they undermined the policy of peace and neutrality and willingly acted as running dogs of the United States. The Geneva Accords solemnly declared that Laos must maintain and consolidate peace and must not participate in any military alliance. The various agreements in Vientiane have also repeatedly emphasized that the Royal Government must firmly follow the path of peace and neutrality and sincerely implement the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence."

The proclamation said: "However, the pro-American clique openly declared the abandonment of the Geneva Accords. Their actions violated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and violated the various agreements in Vientiane." "They accepted U.S. aid on the condition that five-sixths of the 'aid funds' must be used for military purposes under U.S. supervision." "They let U.S. military advisors and military personnel control all the power of the Royal Army. They are mobilizing a large amount of manpower and material resources to expand armaments, expand airports, and build strategic lines of communication. They have also sent people to participate in meetings and military exercises of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc according to U.S. instructions."

The proclamation said: "The pro-American clique still talks about peace and neutrality in words, but their actions are completely opposed to the policy of peace and neutrality. They only follow the head of imperialism, the United States, and are unwilling to establish relations with the Soviet Union, the most peace-loving country in the world. They only collude with Ngo Dinh Diem, the enemy of the Vietnamese people, and are unwilling to establish relations with our good neighbor, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. They only collude with Chiang Kai-shek, the enemy of the Chinese people and the reactionary who is struggling in his death throes, and are unwilling to establish relations with our good neighbor, the People's Republic of China." The proclamation pointed out that the Phoui Sananikone government's foreign policy "damaged Laos' independent and autonomous status and brought about the consequences of undermining our country's democracy and economic independence. The people of our country resolutely oppose this reactionary policy."

2. Undermining the agreement on the establishment of a coalition government.

The proclamation said, "Second, they undermined the agreement on the establishment of a coalition government. According to the various agreements that have been signed, the Royal Government guarantees the correct implementation of the provisions on the establishment of a coalition government with representatives of the Lao Patriotic Front." The proclamation said: "However, the pro-American reactionary clique used all means to exclude representatives of the Lao Patriotic Front from the government. They destroyed the coalition government and established a purely pro-American government."

3. Depriving the people of all democratic freedoms and infringing upon the parliament and the current constitution.

The proclamation said: "Third, they deprived the people of all democratic freedoms and infringed upon the parliament and the current constitution. According to the agreements that have been signed, the Royal Government should guarantee all the democratic freedoms of the people and respect the constitution and the current election law. However, the pro-American reactionary clique has actually trampled on the most basic democratic freedoms of the people."

The proclamation listed the various crimes of the Lao authorities in massacring and suppressing the people and pointed out that "Not only that, but they also infringed upon the power of the parliament, using pressure to force the parliament to grant the government special powers, which actually dissolved the parliament for a long period of time. They also attempted to replace the current election law with a reactionary election law in order to consolidate the pro-American dictatorship; they conspired to amend the constitution, formulate a reactionary constitution, and establish a puppet parliament."

4. Persecuting the Lao Patriotic Front and other progressive political organizations.

The proclamation said, "Fourth, they implemented a policy of hostility, persecution, and suppression of the Lao Patriotic Front and other progressive political organizations, placing Lao Patriotic Front leaders under house arrest and arresting them." The proclamation said, "According to the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, the Royal Government guarantees not to discriminate against, persecute, or retaliate against cadres and fighters of the former Lao Fighting Forces and former resistance personnel, to guarantee that they enjoy civil rights, and to guarantee the Lao Patriotic Front's right to legal activities. However, the pro-American reactionary clique disregarded the agreements that had been signed and implemented a policy of cruel persecution and suppression of cadres and fighters of the former Lao Fighting Forces. They arrested, imprisoned, and killed thousands of former Lao Fighting Forces personnel in various provinces."

The proclamation said that they shot and hanged more than a dozen former resistance personnel in Lower Laos, assassinated a member of the Vientiane Provincial Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, and killed the entire family of the chairman of the Provincial Committee of Houeisai Province.

The proclamation said: They "strictly put Prince Souphanouvong and other leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front under house arrest. Recently, under the pressure of public opinion at home and abroad, they were forced to cancel the order of house arrest, but in reality they secretly sent agents and police to monitor them. They were forced to announce that the Lao Patriotic Front still had the right to move freely, but in reality, they continued to arrest and kill cadres and members of the Lao Patriotic Front everywhere. In Vientiane, the central organ of the Lao Patriotic Front, the 'Lao Patriotic News,' was closed down."

The proclamation said, "Currently, the pro-American reactionary clique is consolidating and expanding the 'Committee for the Defense of National Interests,' gathering the most reactionary and brutal officers, and using the signboard of 'anti-communism' to deceive the people and suppress patriots."

5. Undermining the regulations on the administrative organization of Sam Neua and Phong Saly provinces and the agreement on incorporating staff members of the former Lao Fighting Forces into the Royal Government's administrative organs.

The proclamation said, "Fifth, they undermined the regulations on the administrative organization of Sam Neua and Phong Saly provinces and the agreement on incorporating staff members of the former Lao Fighting Forces into the Royal Government's administrative organs. In the agreement, the Royal Government guaranteed to respect the administrative organizational regulations of the above two provinces and to appoint cadres of the former Lao Fighting Forces to the positions stipulated in the agreement. However, the pro-American reactionary clique used the pretext of transferring staff members to exclude all staff members of the former Lao Fighting Forces, including the governor of Phong Saly Province and the deputy governor of Sam Neua Province. They sent their running dogs and thugs and agents who had worked in the French army for many years back to carry out cruel suppression and retaliation in these two provinces, putting the people of these two provinces in deep water and scorching fire."

6. Undermining Laos' economic independence and making the people's lives increasingly impoverished.

The proclamation said, "Sixth, they listened to the orders of the United States and announced the devaluation of the Lao currency, undermining our country's economic independence and making the people's lives increasingly impoverished."

The proclamation said, "The pro-American reactionary clique willingly allowed U.S. imperialism to monopolize our country's finances in the name of economic 'aid,' to control all the economic lifelines of our country, making our country completely a market for the United States to dump its surplus goods, and the national economy is becoming increasingly depressed." The proclamation said, "They also increased taxes, increased house number taxes in cities, and collected grain and cattle in rural areas, and conscripted laborers and soldiers. They do not supply salt and necessary items to the people in areas far from towns, making it difficult for the people in these places to live."

7. Damaging Lao national culture.

The proclamation said, "Seventh, they allowed degenerate American culture to invade our country, damaging our national culture and infringing upon religion." The proclamation said, "The countless American pornographic books and films imported into our country poisoned our youth," "gambling, prostitution, and hooliganism are rampant," and "temples are sometimes turned into places of licentiousness."

8. Undermining national harmony, provoking civil war, and threatening peace in Indochina.

The proclamation said, "Eighth, they undermined national harmony and provoked civil war. The most serious thing is that recently they used force to attempt to disarm the former Lao Fighting Forces and eliminate them, infringing upon the freedom of movement and personal freedom of the leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front."

The proclamation emphasized that "The pro-American reactionary clique has created a painful situation in which Lao people are fighting Lao people, destroying the peaceful life of our people, and threatening peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia. They must bear full responsibility for the serious consequences they have created." The proclamation called on the Lao people to unite and work together to fight resolutely to cut off the bloody claws of U.S. imperialism and to crush the conspiracy of the Phoui Sananikone government in the face of the crisis facing the motherland.

The Lao Royal Government must thoroughly implement the Geneva Accords and the Vientiane Agreements, immediately stop the civil war, and implement a policy of peace, neutrality, independence, and democracy.

The proclamation demanded that the Lao Royal Government must do the following:

1. Thoroughly and solemnly implement the Geneva Accords and allow the International Commission for Laos to actively resume its activities; thoroughly and solemnly implement the Vientiane Agreements signed by the Royal Government and the former Lao Fighting Forces, and immediately stop the act of expanding the civil war.

2. Solemnly implement the policy of peace and neutrality, safeguard the independence and sovereignty of the country, and establish diplomatic relations with all countries, especially with neighboring countries, on a basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence; abandon the policy of acting as a running dog of U.S. imperialism, as a tool for the United States to prepare for war, and of creating tensions with neighboring countries.

3. Establish a coalition government with representatives of the Lao Patriotic Front, various progressive parties, and people of all ethnic groups.

4. Guarantee the democratic freedoms of the people, the people must have the freedom of movement, freedom of speech, and freedom of assembly and association. Respect the power of parliament and respect the current constitution.

5. Immediately stop the policy of persecution and suppression, and respect the freedom of activity of the Lao Patriotic Front, peace and neutrality organizations, and other progressive political organizations. Immediately stop discrimination against cadres of the former Lao Fighting Forces and former resistance personnel, and restore the freedom of all former Lao Fighting Forces and former resistance personnel who have been illegally arrested in various places.

Truly restore the freedom of Prince Souphanouvong and the leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front.

6. Respect the administrative organizational regulations of the two provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly, withdraw the claws of the pro-American reactionary clique who have been illegally appointed to positions in the two provinces and are persecuting and suppressing the people of the two provinces. Return the civil servants of the former Lao Fighting Forces who hold various positions in accordance with the agreement to the people of the two provinces.

7. Implement an independent economic policy, reduce taxes, and improve the people's lives. Accept any economic assistance that any country is willing to provide to Laos without any conditions attached.

8. Truly develop national culture and respect Buddhism. Maintain the national customs and traditions of the country, and prohibit all kinds of degenerate books and forms of entertainment.

The proclamation concluded by saying, "Under the wise leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, the struggle of our people to realize the above-mentioned urgent aspirations is long-term and arduous, but justice belongs to the people, justice belongs to us. We have the great united strength of the entire Lao people, and we have the support and sympathy of peace-loving people all over the world. Therefore, final victory must belong to us. U.S. imperialism and its reactionary accomplices, who go against the wishes of our people, are bound to suffer a tragic defeat.

    前寮国战斗部队第二营发表告老挝人民书
    万众一心粉碎美国和萨纳尼空政府阴谋
    建立和平中立独立民主统一繁荣的老挝
    新华社河内7日电　老挝川圹消息：据“川圹老挝爱国报”报道，前寮国战斗部队第二营在7月1日发表告老挝全体人民书，全面系统地揭露了培·萨纳尼空政府违反日内瓦协议和老挝双方签定的协议，出卖民族利益，充当美国走狗，挑起国内战争等八大罪状，并提出了八项全民斗争的纲领。
    文告首先追述了老挝人民经过多年英勇抗战，终于使国家的独立、主权和领土完整在日内瓦协议中得到承认，从而取得巨大胜利的事实。
    文告说，老挝爱国战线党以民族利益为重，同意交出（桑怒、丰沙里）两省，复员大部分军队，把一部分军队并入王国政府的军队中。王国政府方面则保证实行和平中立政策，成立了有前寮国战斗部队代表参加的联合政府，保证所有公民享有民主自由权利，保证不对前寮国战斗部队人员和前抗战人员进行歧视报复。这样，经过了十年的战斗，枪声才停止下来。
    美国阴谋把老挝变为它的殖民地和军事基地，千方百计要消灭寮国战斗部队。萨纳尼空政府撕毁日内瓦协议，包围寮国战斗部队。
    文告接着指出，但是，美帝国主义和它的走狗——一撮祸国殃民的老挝人，不愿老挝执行和平中立和独立民主的政策；他们阴谋把老挝变成美国的殖民地和军事基地，阴谋把老挝拉入东南亚侵略集团。
    文告说，因此，“在前寮国战斗部队两个营调到镇宁平原和川银驻扎之后，他们千方百计地要消灭我们，好让他们为所欲为地窃取我国人民流了多少血汗才换来的革命果实”。
    文告在历述一年多以来，特别是培·萨纳尼空政府执政以来，前寮国战斗部队两个营所受到的令人难以容忍的迫害之后说：“今年5月11日，在宣布撕毁日内瓦协议并在各地加强镇压屠杀之后，他们以为一切已经准备停当，于是便以授‘军衔’为借口加紧实现上述阴谋。”文告说：“他们命令我们把全部武器放进仓库而空手到另一地点接受‘军衔’。这个地点四面围有铁丝网，并事先在周围布置了三个营的全副武装的王国军队。”
    文告说：“面对他们反复无常的阴谋，我们非常镇定。我们建议缓期几天，以便共同协商，取得符合已经签定的协议的精神和条文的一致意见。他们拒绝了这项正当的建议，并立即命令军队包围我们，把枪口对准我们的营房和我们的部分家属的住所，几天后，他们宣布切断供应，并提出条件说，如果不服从命令，在二十四小时后将以叛乱分子论罪。”文告说：“我们对他们这种极其卑鄙的背约行为感到无比愤怒。为了避免骨肉相残，我们决定突围”。
    寮国战斗部队第二营得到人民爱戴和支持，击败了敌人阴谋，保存了力量，指战员士气旺盛。
    文告谈到第二营突围的经过之后说：“自从我们来到川圹省东南驻扎之后，王国军队近一个月来仍然继续进行由他们一手造成的内战。王国军队继续在村庄中‘扫荡’，逮捕前寮国战斗部队人员，奸淫妇女，劫掠牲畜，阻挠老百姓从事生产。每到一个地方，都制造了战争惨象。老百姓对他们的非正义的行为感到无比愤怒，因此不同他们合作，而同我们站在一起来反对他们。”
    文告说：“今天，当他们进攻的枪声和我们斗争的枪声正继续响着的时候，我们十分兴奋地、满怀信心地告诉同胞们，我们已经击败了王国军队包围和消灭第二营的阴谋，并得到各族人民的充分的爱戴和支持。前寮国战斗部队第二营的力量仍然保存着，指挥员和战斗员们的战斗情绪依然旺盛。我们愿同全国各族人民紧密团结，为要求王国政府充分履行日内瓦协议和万象各项协议而奋斗到底，共同建立和平、中立、独立、民主、统一和繁荣的老挝。”
    萨纳尼空反动集团八大罪状
    告全民书中接着列述了培·萨纳尼空反动集团和所谓“保卫国家利益委员会”集团的八大罪状。
    一、破坏和平中立政策，充当美国走狗。
    文告说，“第一，他们破坏了和平中立政策，甘心充当美国的走狗。日内瓦协议庄严地宣布老挝必须维护和巩固和平，不得参加任何军事联盟。万象的各项协议也多次强调王国政府必须坚决走和平中立的道路，真诚地实现和平共处五项原则。”
    文告说：“然而，亲美集团公然声明废弃日内瓦协议。它们的行动违背了和平共处五项原则，违反了万象的各项协议。”“他们以必须在美国的监督下把六分之五的‘援助款项’用于军事目的的条件，接受了美国的援助。”“他们让美国的军事顾问和军事人员掌握王国军队的全部权力，他们正在调动大量人力和物力来扩充军备，扩建机场，修筑战略交通线。他们还根据美国的指示，派人参加了东南亚侵略集团的会议和军事演习。”
    文告说：“亲美集团口头上还谈两句和平中立，但是，他们的行动却是完全反对和平中立政策。他们只追随帝国主义的头子美国，而不愿同世界上最热爱和平的国家苏联建立关系。他们只同越南人民的敌人吴庭艳勾结，而不愿同我们的好邻邦越南民主共和国建立关系。他们只同中国人民的敌人、正在作垂死挣扎的反动分子蒋介石勾结，而不愿同我们的好邻邦中华人民共和国建立关系。”文告指出，培·萨纳尼空政府的外交政策“损害了老挝的独立自主地位，带来了破坏我国民主和经济独立的后果。我国全体人民坚决反对这一反动政策。”
    二、破坏关于成立联合政府的协议。
    文告说，“第二，他们破坏了关于成立联合政府的协议。根据已签定的各项协议，王国政府保证正确实施关于成立有老挝爱国战线党代表参加的联合政府的条款。”文告说：“然而，亲美的反动集团用尽一切手段来把老挝爱国战线党的代表排斥于政府之外。他们破坏了联合政府，建立起清一色的亲美政府。”
    三、剥夺人民一切民主自由权利，侵犯了议会和现行宪法。
    文告说：“第三，他们剥夺了人民的一切民主自由权利，侵犯了议会和现行宪法。根据已经签订的协议，王国政府应该保障人民的一切民主自由权利，尊重宪法和现行的选举法。然而，亲美的反动集团实际上已经践踏了人民最起码的民主自由权利。”
    文告列举了老挝当局屠杀、镇压人民的种种罪行之后指出，“不仅如此，他们还侵犯了议会的权力，用压力强迫议会赋予政府以特别权力，实际上是在一段长时期内解散了议会。他们还企图以反动的选举法来代替目前的选举法，借以巩固亲美的独裁制度；阴谋修改宪法，制定反动宪法，成立傀儡议会。”
    四、迫害老挝爱国战线党和其他进步的政治组织。
    文告说，“第四，他们实行了敌视、迫害、镇压老挝爱国战线党和其他进步的政治组织的政策，软禁和逮捕老挝爱国战线党的领袖。”文告说，“根据日内瓦协议和万象各项协议，王国政府保证不歧视、迫害、报复前寮国战斗部队的干部、战士和前抗战人员，保障他们享有公民权利，保障老挝爱国战线党的合法活动权利。然而，亲美的反动集团无视已经签订的协议，他们执行了对前寮国战斗部队干部和战士进行残酷的迫害和镇压的政策。他们在各省逮捕、监禁和杀害成千的前寮国战斗部队人员。”
    文告说，他们枪杀、绞死了下寮的十多名前抗战人员，暗杀了老挝爱国战线党万象省委会的一名委员，把会晒省省委会主席全家杀光。
    文告说：他们“严密地软禁苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党的其他领袖。最近在国内外舆论的压力下，他们被迫取消软禁的命令，但实际上他们还秘密派特务和警察进行监视。他们被迫宣布老挝爱国战线党仍然有权自由活动，但实际上，他们继续到处逮捕和杀害老挝爱国战线党的干部和党员。在万象，老挝爱国战线党的中央机关报‘老挝爱国报’被封闭”。
    文告说，“目前，亲美的反动集团正在巩固和扩大‘保卫国家利益委员会’，纠集最反动、最凶暴的军官，用‘反共’的招牌进行欺骗人民、镇压爱国者的活动。”
    五、破坏关于桑怒和丰沙里两省行政组织规章和前寮国战斗部队职员编入王国政府行政机构的协议。
  文告说，“第五，他们破坏了关于桑怒和丰沙里两省的行政组织规章和前寮国战斗部队职员编入王国政府行政机构的协议。在协议中，王国政府保证尊重上述两省行政组织规章，委派前寮国战斗部队干部担任协议规定的职务。但是亲美反动集团以调动职员为借口，把所有的前寮国战斗部队的职员都排挤出来，其中包括丰沙里省省长和桑怒省副省长。他们派自己的走狗和曾经在法国军队中工作多年的暴徒和特务卷土重来，在这两个省中进行残酷的镇压和报复活动，使这两省人民处于水深火热之中。”
    六、破坏老挝经济独立，使人民生活日益贫困。
    文告说，“第六，他们听从美国的命令，宣布老挝币贬值，破坏了我国的经济独立，使人民的生活日益贫困。”
    文告说，“亲美的反动集团甘心让美帝国主义以经济‘援助’的名义垄断我国的财政，控制我国的一切经济命脉，使得我国完全成为美国倾销过剩商品的市场，国民经济日益萧条。”文告说，“他们还增加税收，在城市增加门牌税，在农村征收粮食和牛，抓伕抓丁。他们不供应食盐和必要的物品给离城镇较远的地区的人民，使得这些地方人民生活发生困难。”
                            七、损害老挝民族文化。
    文告说，“第七，他们让堕落的美国文化侵入我国，损害我们的民族文化，侵犯宗教。”文告说，“输入我国的无数美国色情书刊和影片毒害了我国青年”，“赌博、卖淫、流氓泛滥成灾”，“寺庙有时被变成了荒淫的场所”。
  八、破坏民族和睦，挑起内战，威胁印度支那和平。
    文告说，“第八，他们破坏民族的和睦，挑起内战。最严重的是最近他们用武力企图解除前寮国战斗部队的武装和消灭他们，侵犯老挝爱国战线党领袖的行动自由和人身自由。”
    文告强调指出，“亲美反动集团造成老挝人打老挝人令人痛心的局面，破坏了我国人民的和平生活，威胁了印度支那和东南亚的和平。他们必须对自己制造的严重后果负完全责任。”告全民书号召老挝人民在祖国面临危难的情况下，团结起来，万众一心，为砍断美帝国主义的血腥魔掌，为粉碎培·萨纳尼空政府的阴谋而坚决斗争。
    老挝王国政府必须彻底履行日内瓦协议和万象协议，立即停止内战，执行和平中立独立民主的政策。
    文告要求老挝王国政府必须做到下列几点：
    一、彻底地和严正地履行日内瓦协议，让老挝国际委员会积极恢复活动；彻底地和严正地实行王国政府同前寮国战斗部队签订的万象协议，立即停止扩大内战的行为。
    二、严正履行和平中立政策，维护国家的独立、主权，在和平共处五项原则的基础上同所有各国，特别是同各邻国建立外交关系；放弃充当美帝国主义走狗、作为美国准备战争的工具和制造同各邻国之间的紧张关系的政策。
    三、成立有老挝爱国战线党代表、各进步党派和各族人民代表参加的联合政府。
    四、保障人民的民主自由权利，人民必须有来往自由、言论自由和集会结社的自由。尊重议会的权力，尊重现行的宪法。
    五、立刻停止迫害、镇压政策，尊重老挝爱国战线党、和平中立组织和其他进步的政治组织的活动自由。立即停止对前寮国战斗部队干部和前抗战人员的歧视，恢复在各地被非法逮捕的所有前寮国战斗部队和前抗战人员的自由。
    真正恢复苏发努冯亲王和老挝爱国战线党各位领袖的自由。
    六、尊重（桑怒、丰沙里）两省的行政组织规章，撤回被非法指定在两省中担任职务的那些正在迫害、镇压两省人民的亲美反动集团的爪牙。把根据双方协议担任各种职务的前寮国战斗部队的公务人员交还给两省人民。
    七、执行独立的经济政策，减轻赋税，改善人民生活。接受任何国家愿意向老挝提供的、不附带任何条件的经济援助。
    八、真正发展民族文化，尊重佛教。维护国家的淳风美俗，禁止各种堕落的书籍和娱乐的方式。
    文告最后说，“在老挝爱国战线党的英明领导下，我国人民为实现上述迫切愿望的斗争是长期和艰苦的，但是正义属于人民，正义属于我们。我们有着老挝全国人民的伟大的团结力量、我们有着全世界爱好和平人民的支持和同情。因此，最后胜利一定是属于我们的。违背我国人民愿望的美帝国主义和它的反动帮凶集团一定要遭到悲惨的失败。
                              （文内小插题是本报编者所加）
