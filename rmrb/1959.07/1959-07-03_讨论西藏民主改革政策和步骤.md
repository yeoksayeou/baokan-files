Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 2nd: The Second Plenary Meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region grandly opened on June 28th in the Lhasa Auditorium. This meeting will discuss and decide on the issue of carrying out democratic reforms throughout the region, making it the largest meeting held by the Preparatory Committee since its establishment.

    Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, Panchen Erdeni, presided over the meeting.

    Zhang Jingwu, representative of the Central People's Government in Tibet and Secretary of the Tibet Working Committee of the CPC, and Wang Feng, Deputy Director of the Ethnic Affairs Commission and Deputy Director of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, also attended the meeting.

    Responsible cadres from various departments of the Tibet Working Committee of the CPC, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and the Tibet Military Region, as well as over 600 representatives from people's organizations, various social strata, religious circles, and laborers from all walks of life in Lhasa, attended the meeting as observers. Over a hundred labor representatives from various industries in Lhasa, who were previously referred to as "outcasts," wore their observer passes on their chests as they entered the venue. This was unprecedented in Tibet's past.

    At the beginning of the meeting, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme delivered an opening speech. He said: This meeting is to discuss the implementation of democratic reforms in Tibet, making it a historically significant meeting for Tibet, with a glorious and important responsibility. The meeting will discuss and decide on tasks related to suppressing the rebellion, rural work, and pastoral work in Tibet. He wished the meeting a complete success and warmly welcomed Representative Zhang Jingwu and Deputy Director Wang Feng's attendance.

    Panchen Erdeni then delivered a report to the meeting on his attendance at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress and the First Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. (Full text on page two) Panchen Erdeni said: This National People's Congress was a conference of unity and a conference of great leap forward. Representatives of all ethnic groups across the country gathered together to discuss and decide on major national affairs, fully embodying the unified leadership of our great multi-ethnic country, embodying the rights of all ethnic groups to be masters of their own affairs, and embodying the true national equality and close unity of the people of all ethnic groups.

    Panchen Erdeni said: The National People's Congress made a resolution on the Tibet issue. The resolution is completely in line with the actual situation in Tibet and the interests of the monks and laypeople.

    Panchen Erdeni expressed his heartfelt gratitude for the infinite care that the central government and the people of the whole country have given to the Tibetan people after the rebellion in Tibet. In his speech, he also described the achievements of various aspects of work in the three months since the suppression of the rebellion in Tibet. He pointed out that now, with the strong support of the broad masses of monks and laypeople, the People's Liberation Army and administrative personnel have basically suppressed the rebellion, controlled all the remote areas formerly occupied by the rebels, abolished the reactionary regime of the brutal feudal serf owners, announced the policy of "whoever cultivates the land this year harvests it" for the land of the rebellious serf owners, and, wherever they went, investigated rebels, stabilized social order, visited the poor and asked about their difficulties, issued interest-free agricultural loans, provided relief to the poor, helped the masses with production, and prepared for the realization of the urgent desire of the broad masses of people for democratic reform. He expressed his satisfaction with the rapid development of these works and the remarkable achievements.

    Panchen Erdeni emphasized: Tibet is an inseparable part of our great motherland. Suppressing the rebellion in Tibet and carrying out various tasks in Tibet are all our country's internal affairs and no foreign interference is allowed. Imperialists and foreign interventionists want to use the suppression of the rebellion in Tibet to undermine the friendly relations between our country and our neighboring country, India, undermine the friendly relations between our country and Asian countries, and split the unity of our motherland. These conspiracies and tricks have already suffered a shameful failure.

    Panchen Erdeni said: At present, the urgent task facing the people of all strata in Tibet is, as pointed out in the resolution on the Tibet issue at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress, to implement the democratic reforms that the broad masses of Tibetan people have long expected and urgently demanded. He said that democratic reform in Tibet will be a peaceful reform. When carrying out the reform, under the wise leadership and correct policy guidance of the central government, we will adopt a redemption policy for the upper classes in Tibet who have not participated in the rebellion. This will not only benefit the emancipation and liberation of the broad masses of working people, but also benefit the people of the upper classes, which is a win-win situation.

    He said: The exploiters have used the land to exploit the broad masses of people for thousands of years, and have already owed the people a large amount of debt. In principle, the land should be returned to the people without compensation. Now, when the reform is carried out, the redemption policy is implemented for the upper-class people who have not participated in the rebellion. The people generally do not blame them for the past, give them leniency, take the initiative to unite them, and give them a way out in life and politics. This is something that all upper-class people should understand the righteousness and thank the country and the people.

    Panchen Erdeni also talked about the religious issue in the reform. He said: Democratic reform will inevitably involve the feudal oppression and exploitation system of the monasteries. To reform these feudal oppression and exploitation systems, let the country's constitution enter the monasteries, give lamas personal freedom, recognize that lamas are also citizens, lamas can read books, read newspapers, study, attend meetings, participate in work, and participate in labor, and serve the country and the people. Various undertakings are constantly changing and developing, and some unreasonable systems in religion should also be constantly reformed. Historically, Master Tsongkhapa was a famous religious reformer.

    Panchen Erdeni particularly emphasized that democratic reform and the protection of freedom of religious belief and the protection of cultural relics and temples are two different things. The government has repeatedly stated, and practical life has repeatedly proven, that the policy of freedom of religious belief has not changed. Religious belief is a personal matter, a matter of thought and belief. Believing in religion or not is entirely a personal freedom, and no one shall interfere with it. The government will always protect it. Doing so is the true implementation of the policy of protecting freedom of religious belief.

    Panchen Erdeni finally said: "Let us unite closely, under the leadership of the Party, with the vigorous help of the country and all fraternal ethnic groups, on the basis of thoroughly suppressing the rebellion, extensively and fully mobilize the masses, unite and educate the monks and laypeople of all strata, resolutely, actively and victoriously complete the democratic reform, and join the people of the whole country to enter a prosperous and happy socialist society."

    Panchen Erdeni's speech constantly aroused warm applause in the venue.

    Zhang Guohua, Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Working Committee of the CPC and Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, spoke at the afternoon meeting on the issues of the Tibetan people's urgent demand for democratic reform, the policy and steps of implementing democratic reform, etc. (Excerpts from the speech are on page two). He first recounted some of the situations he learned during his recent visit to Shannan. He said: The all-out armed rebellion launched by the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group in collusion with imperialists and foreign interventionists first began in the Shannan area. There is ample evidence to prove that the Tibetan upper-class reactionary group launched this rebellion in collusion with imperialists and foreign interventionists, and that the conspiracy and planning have been going on for a long time. He then talked about the suffering and harm the people of Shannan suffered from the rebels, the great victory achieved by the People's Liberation Army in suppressing the rebels in Shannan, and the warm welcome they received from the people of Shannan.

    Zhang Guohua analyzed the class relations in the Shannan area. He pointed out that poor peasants accounted for about 70% of the Shannan area, middle peasants accounted for about 25%-26%, and serf owners only accounted for 4%-5%. The main means of production are occupied by the three major lords (temples, nobles, and the former Tibetan local government). There are extremely many exorbitant taxes and levies, and usury is even more appalling. Serfs have no political rights or freedom. The humiliation of serfs by serf owners is even more arbitrary. If such a backward, dark, cruel, and barbarous social system is not reformed, it is fundamentally impossible to develop Tibet's economy and culture and enable the Tibetan people to live a bright and happy life.

    Zhang Guohua said that under the cruel rule of the feudal serf system, the broad masses of monks and laypeople in Shannan deeply hated the former Tibetan local government and serf owners. Therefore, when the People's Liberation Army began to suppress the rebellion, the masses were jubilant. The broad masses of monks and laypeople who have been oppressed and exploited for thousands of years have stood up today, just as they themselves said: "The poor are speaking," "The happy sun is shining on our heads." They used these words to express their comfortable mood. At present, the masses urgently demand the distribution of land, the abolition of corvée labor, the abolition of slavery, the abolition of usury, and the abolition of all the privileges of temples that oppress monks and laypeople. All these demands are completely reasonable and just. We should give them deep sympathy and fully support and help them realize these demands.

    Zhang Guohua said that according to the situation in Shannan and the demands of the masses, at present, in addition to continuing to eliminate the remaining rebels who have escaped and implementing the policy of "whoever cultivates the land harvests it" for the land of the upper-class elements who participated in the rebellion, Shannan is mobilizing the masses to carry out the "three antis" (anti-rebellion, anti-corvée labor system, anti-slavery) and "double reduction" (rent reduction, interest reduction) movement, establishing political power and protecting production. When Zhang Guohua talked about these issues, warm applause broke out in the venue.

    Regarding how to reform, Zhang Guohua put forward several suggestions for the meeting to discuss based on the previous consultation between the Tibet Working Committee of the CPC and all parties. He said that it is now time to gradually implement democratic reforms. Democratic reform is divided into two steps. The first step is to mobilize the masses, thoroughly suppress the rebellion, and carry out the movement against rebellion, against corvée labor system, against slavery, and to implement rent reduction and interest reduction; the second step is to distribute land. At present, in agricultural areas, the agents of the three major lords still control the masses, and the advantage of the masses has not yet been formed. To uncover the lid of the feudal system and establish the advantage of the masses, the key is to mobilize the masses, abolish the corvée labor system and personal attachment, and implement rent reduction and interest reduction for feudal lords who have not participated in the rebellion. At the same time, abolish the old rural regime and establish peasant associations. The peasant association is the basic organizational form for leading the masses in democratic reform in rural areas, and it is also the grassroots political power organization in rural areas during the democratic reform. In order to protect and develop livestock, a policy of non-distribution of livestock and mutual benefit between herdsmen and owners will be implemented in pastoral areas, but the "three antis" must be carried out. The livestock of the rebels will be confiscated and owned by the original grazers, and the livestock of the owners who have not participated in the rebellion will still belong to the owners. In temples, a movement against rebellion, against privilege, and against exploitation must be carried out, but at the same time, the Party and the country's policy of freedom of religious belief must be firmly and unswervingly implemented, patriotic and law-abiding lamas must be protected, and the cultural relics and historical sites of the temples must be protected. A policy of protection will be adopted for commerce, law-abiding foreign businessmen will be protected, and handicrafts will be supported.

    Finally, he hoped that the meeting would conduct a detailed discussion on the issue of democratic reform in order to unify understanding and lay a good foundation for future work. His speech was constantly interrupted by warm applause, and people unanimously expressed their support for immediately implementing the "three antis and double reduction" throughout the region.

    The meeting on the 28th also decided to spend three days discussing the reports of Panchen Erdeni and Zhang Guohua in depth within the groups. (Attached picture)

### 讨论西藏民主改革政策和步骤

    西藏自治区筹备委员会举行第二次全体会议
    讨论西藏民主改革政策和步骤
    第一步：发动群众，彻底平叛，反叛乱，反乌拉制度，反奴役，减租减息；第二步：分配土地班禅额尔德尼传达全国人大和政协会议精神，张国华谈民主改革政策等问题
    新华社拉萨2日电　西藏自治区筹备委员会第二次全体委员会议6月28日在拉萨大礼堂隆重开幕。这次会议将讨论和决定在全区进行民主改革的问题，这是自治区筹委会成立后规模最大的一次会议。
    会议由西藏自治区筹委会代理主任委员班禅额尔德尼主持。
    中央人民政府驻西藏代表、中共西藏工委书记张经武和民族事务委员会副主任、中共中央统一战线工作部副部长汪锋也参加了这次会议。
    中共西藏工委、西藏自治区筹委会和西藏军区各部门负责干部，以及拉萨市各人民团体、各阶层、宗教界和各行各业劳动人民的代表共六百多人，都列席了这次会议。拉萨市各行各业的一百多名劳动人民代表过去被称为“贱民”，今天他们把列席证挂在胸前，走进会场，这种情况，在西藏过去是没有的。
    会议开始时，阿沛·阿旺晋美致开幕词。他说：这次会议是讨论在西藏实行民主改革的会议，是西藏具有重要历史意义的会议，它具有光荣而重大的责任。在这次会议上将讨论和决定关于西藏当前平息叛乱、农村工作和牧区工作等方面的任务。他预祝会议圆满成功，并对张经武代表和汪锋副主任参加这次会议表示热烈欢迎。
    班禅额尔德尼接着向会议作了出席第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议和政协第三届全国委员会第一次会议的传达报告。（全文见第二版）班禅额尔德尼说：这次全国人民代表大会是一次团结的大会，跃进的大会。全国各族人民的代表齐集一堂，共同讨论和决定了国家的大事，充分体现了我们多民族伟大国家的统一领导，体现了各民族当家作主的权利，体现了各民族人民真正的民族平等和亲密大团结。
    班禅额尔德尼说：在全国人民代表大会上作出了关于西藏问题的决议。决议是完全符合西藏的实际情况和僧俗人民利益的。
    班禅额尔德尼对于西藏叛乱发生后，中央和全国人民给予西藏人民的无限关怀表示衷心的感谢。他在讲话中还叙述了西藏平息叛乱三个月来各方面工作的成绩。他指出，现在，人民解放军和行政工作人员，在广大僧俗人民的大力支援下，已经基本上平息了叛乱，控制了从前为叛匪盘据的所有边远地区，废除了残暴的封建农奴主的反动政权，宣布对叛乱农奴主的土地今年实行谁种谁收的政策，并在所到之处，清查叛匪，安定社会秩序，访贫问苦，发放无息农贷，救济贫苦人民，帮助群众生产，并为实现广大人民要求民主改革的迫切心愿作了准备工作。他对这些工作的迅速发展和所取得的显著成绩，感到很满意。
    班禅额尔德尼强调说：西藏是我们伟大祖国不可分割的一部分，平息西藏叛乱和在西藏进行各种工作，都是我们国家的内政，不容许任何外国人干涉。帝国主义和外国干涉者，想借平息西藏叛乱，来破坏我国和印度邻邦的友好关系，破坏我国和亚洲国家的友好关系，分裂我们祖国的统一，这些阴谋诡计已经在遭受可耻的失败。
    班禅额尔德尼说：目前，摆在西藏各阶层人民群众面前的迫切任务，就是第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议在关于西藏问题决议中所指出的，即实行广大西藏人民期待已久的和迫切要求的民主改革。他说，西藏的民主改革将是一场和平的改革。进行改革时，在中央的英明领导和正确政策指导下，我们对于西藏没有参加叛乱的上层阶级将采取赎买政策。这样既有利于广大劳动人民的翻身和解放，也有利于上层阶级人士，是两全其美的好办法。
    他说：剥削者利用土地对广大人民剥削了千百年，已负了人民大量的债，照理应将土地无偿地归还人民；现在改革时对没有参加叛乱的上层阶级人士实行赎买政策，人民对他们一般不咎既往，给以宽大，主动进行团结，并给其生活上和政治上的出路，这是所有上层人士应当明晓大义感谢国家和人民的。
    班禅额尔德尼还谈到了改革中的宗教问题。他说：民主改革势必牵涉到寺院的封建压迫剥削制度，要改革这些封建压迫剥削制度，让国家的宪法进庙门、给予喇嘛人身自由，承认喇嘛也是公民，喇嘛可以念书、看报、学习、开会、参加工作、参加劳动，为国家为人民效劳。各种事业都在不断地变化和发展，宗教中一些不合理的制度也应不断进行改革。历史上宗喀巴大师就是有名的宗教改革家。
    班禅额尔德尼特别强调指出：民主改革和保护宗教信仰自由、保护文物寺庙是两回事。政府再三声明，实际生活也再三证实：宗教信仰自由政策是没有变的。宗教信仰是个人的事情，是思想信仰问题，信教或不信教完全是个人的自由，任何人不得加以干涉，政府永远是保护的。这样做，才是真正贯彻执行了保护宗教信仰自由政策。
    班禅额尔德尼最后说：“让我们紧密地团结起来，在党的领导下，在国家和各兄弟民族大力帮助下，在彻底平息叛乱的基础上，广泛充分地发动群众，团结、教育各阶层僧俗群众，坚决地、积极地胜利完成民主改革，并和全国人民一道，共同进入繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。”
    班禅额尔德尼的讲话，不断激起会场上热烈的掌声。
    中共西藏工委副书记、自治区筹委会副主任委员张国华在下午的会议上就西藏人民迫切要求实行民主改革、实行民主改革的政策和步骤等问题讲了话（讲话摘要见第二版）。他首先讲述了不久前他访问山南时了解到的一些情况。他说：原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团勾结帝国主义、外国干涉者所发动的全面武装叛乱，首先是在山南地区开始的。有种种事实证明，西藏上层反动集团发动这次叛乱，是与帝国主义和外国干涉者互相勾结的，而且阴谋策划由来已久。他接着谈到了山南人民遭到叛匪蹂躏和残害的情形，和人民解放军在进剿山南叛匪中取得的伟大胜利，以及受到山南人民热烈欢迎的情景。
    张国华分析了山南地区的阶级关系，他指出，山南地区的贫苦农户约占70％，中等农户约占25％—26％，农奴主只占4％—5％。主要生产资料为三大领主（寺庙、贵族、原西藏地方政府）所占有。苛捐杂税极多，高利贷剥削更是骇人听闻。农奴们在政治上没有任何权利和自由，农奴主对农奴的污辱，更是为所欲为。这样落后、黑暗、残酷和野蛮的社会制度，如果不进行改革，要想发展西藏的经济、文化，使西藏人民过光明幸福的生活，是根本不可能的。
    张国华说，山南广大僧俗人民在封建农奴制度的残酷统治下，对原西藏地方政府和农奴主深恶痛绝，因此，人民解放军开始平叛后，群众欢欣鼓舞。千百年来被压迫剥削的广大僧俗人民今天站了起来，正如他们自己所说：“穷人讲话了”，“幸福的太阳照在我们头上了”。他们用这些话来表达自己的舒畅心情。群众当前迫切要求分配土地，废除乌拉差役、废除奴役、废除高利贷、废除寺庙压榨僧俗人民的一切特权。所有这些要求都是完全合理的，是正义的，我们应当寄以深切同情，并全力支持帮助他们实现这些要求。
    张国华说，根据山南情况和群众要求，目前山南除继续肃清漏网的残余叛匪和对叛乱的上层分子的土地实行谁种谁收以外，正在发动群众进行“三反”（反对叛乱、反对乌拉差役制度、反对奴役）“双减”（减租、减息）运动，建立政权和保护生产等项工作。当张国华谈到这些问题的时候，全场响起了热烈的掌声。
    关于如何改革的问题，张国华根据中共西藏工委会前与各方面的协商，提出几点建议请会议讨论。他说，现在是逐步实行民主改革。民主改革分为两个步骤，第一步是发动群众，彻底平定叛乱，开展反对叛乱、反对乌拉差役制度、反对奴役以及实行减租、减息的运动；第二步是分配土地。目前，在农业区，三大领主的代理人仍控制着群众，群众的优势还未形成，要揭掉封建制度的盖子，树立群众的优势，其关键是发动群众，废除乌拉差役制度和人身依附关系，对未参加叛乱的封建领主实行减租减息。同时，废除农村旧政权，建立农民协会。农民协会是在农村领导群众进行民主改革的基本组织形式，也是民主改革期间的农村基层政权组织。为了保护和发展牲畜，在牧区实行不分配牲畜和牧工牧主两利的政策，但要进行“三反”。对于叛乱分子的牲畜，没收归原牧放者所有，未参加叛乱牧主的牲畜仍归牧主所有。在寺庙要进行反叛乱、反特权、反剥削的运动，但同时要坚定不移地执行党和国家的宗教信仰自由政策，保护爱国守法的喇嘛和保护寺庙的文物古迹。对于商业采取保护的政策，对于守法的外商予以保护，对于手工业加以扶持。
    最后，他希望会议对民主改革问题进行详细讨论，以便统一认识，为今后的工作打下良好的基础。他的讲话不断为热烈的掌声所打断，人们一致表示拥护立即在全区实行“三反双减”。
    28日的会议还决定用三天的时间在小组内对班禅额尔德尼和张国华的报告进行深入的讨论。（附图片）
