    Beijing Railway Bureau Launches Daily, Decadal, and Monthly Appraisal Competitions
    Locomotive Coal Consumption Below National Targets
    (Our Newspaper's Report) In the continuing and in-depth increase production and practice economy campaign this year, the Beijing Railway Bureau has focused on conserving locomotive coal. In the first half of the year, the bureau saved 37,544 tons of locomotive coal, a 4% reduction compared to the Ministry of Railways' set locomotive coal consumption targets, making it one of the leading railway bureaus in the country for conserving locomotive coal.
    The bureau's coal consumption accounts for 11% of the total coal consumption of the national railway system, and 82% of this coal is used in the locomotives that power the trains. The expenditure on locomotive operation coal alone accounts for 56.23% of the total operating expenditure of the locomotive department. At the beginning of this year, through detailed accounting, the vast number of employees realized that conserving locomotive coal not only has significant economic benefits but is also a major political task. The various locomotive departments then launched a vigorous mass campaign of "daily appraisal, decadal appraisal, monthly appraisal" and "identifying targets, mutually linking up, exchanging experiences, and jointly improving" to conserve coal. They also used methods such as holding on-site meetings to disseminate the experience of advanced locomotives in saving coal. By April, all nine sections under the bureau had achieved coal savings; the Fengtai Locomotive Depot also became an advanced section that eliminated all coal-wasting locomotives.
    Now, the locomotive department employees of this bureau are advancing victoriously and have put forward a new plan to save another 20,000 tons of locomotive coal in the second half of the year. At the beginning of July, a new upsurge in coal-saving competitions emerged in various locomotive depots. In the first eight days of July, the bureau saved another 950 tons of locomotive coal. The Guye Locomotive Depot alone saved 310 tons of locomotive coal from July 1st to 8th, becoming the locomotive depot with the most coal savings among the nine depots under the bureau.

    北京铁路局开展日日、旬旬、月月评比竞赛
    机车用煤低于国家指标
    本报讯　北京铁路局在今年继续深入开展的增产节约运动中，大抓节约机车用煤工作，上半年全局节约了机车用煤三万七千五百四十四吨，比铁道部部定机车用煤指标降低了百分之四，成为全国各铁路局中节约机车用煤的先进单位之一。
    这个局的用煤量占全国铁路系统用煤总量的百分之十一，而且这些燃煤百分之八十二是用在火车的动力机车上，光机车运转用煤的支出就占机务部门运营总支出的56.23％。今年年初，通过算细账，广大职工认识到节约机车用煤不仅有重大的经济意义，还是一项重大的政治任务，各机务部门随即开展了“日日评、旬旬评、月月评”和“自找对象、互相挂钩、相互交流经验、共同提高”的轰轰烈烈的群众性的节约用煤竞赛，并通过召开现场会议的方法，传播先进机车节约用煤的经验。到4月份这个局所属的九个段就达到了段段都节煤；丰台机务段并成为消灭了一切费煤机车的先进段。
    现在，这个局机务部门职工正乘胜前进，又提出了下半年再节约机车用煤两万吨的新的计划。7月份一开始，各机务段就又出现了一个节煤竞赛新高潮。7月的头八天，全局机车用煤又节约了九百五十吨。仅古冶机务段，7月1至8日全段就节约了机车用煤三百一十吨，成为这个局所属九个机务段中节煤最多的一个段。
