Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch: According to TASS, 28th dispatch: Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev wrote a letter on June 24th to Richter, Chairman of the European Anti-Nuclear Armament Committee, and Collins, Vice-Chairman, stating, "As before, the Soviet Union is prepared to immediately and without delay sign an agreement on the cessation of tests of all types of atomic and hydrogen weapons." He said, "As in the past, the cessation of nuclear tests currently depends entirely on whether the governments of the United States and Britain are prepared to take this step."

Richter and Collins had recently written to the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain, representing the various organizations participating in the European Anti-Nuclear Armament Committee, strongly requesting the conclusion of an agreement on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing. Khrushchev's letter of June 24th was a reply to them.

In their letter to Khrushchev, Richter and Collins expressed their hope that the heads of government of the United States, the Soviet Union, and Britain would clearly demonstrate their sincerity and achieve fruitful results at the Geneva conference on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing. In his reply, Khrushchev stated that the Soviet Union has consistently and firmly supported the permanent cessation of nuclear testing, both in the past and at present. He said that the Soviet Union's sincerity on the issue of stopping nuclear tests has been proven more than once by concrete facts.

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 29th dispatch: (By our correspondent Zhang Yang) The working group studying how to detect and identify high-altitude nuclear explosions today submitted an interim report to the Soviet, American, and British conference on the discontinuation of nuclear weapons testing. The interim report stated: "The working group is currently preparing a final report, which will be submitted to the conference on the cessation of nuclear weapons testing as soon as possible."

This working group has been working under the instructions of the conference on the cessation of nuclear testing. It has held seven meetings from June 22nd to 29th.

During this week, the delegations of the three countries spent most of their time discussing the staffing of monitoring stations. To meet the demands of the Western delegations, Soviet representative Tsarapkin suggested increasing the number of foreign experts at monitoring stations from four or five to six or seven.

Observers here believe that unless there is a purpose other than effectively detecting and identifying concealed explosions, personnel issues should not cause serious divisions between the two sides. Based on the current level of technology, the issue of monitoring has been greatly simplified. All methods of detecting nuclear explosions can be fully mechanized and automated, and enclosed in special containers. To prevent distortion, as the Soviet side originally suggested, one or two representatives from the other side would be sufficient at the monitoring stations.

It is worth noting that the Soviet delegation suggested appropriately increasing the number of foreign monitoring personnel to meet the demands of the West. However, the West did not respond to this concession by the Soviet delegation. The United States and British delegations also did not offer a positive response to another important Soviet proposal on predetermining the number of inspections each year.

### 赫鲁晓夫复函欧洲反核军备委员会主席  苏联坚持永远停止核试验  美英在不继续核试验会议上对苏联建议拖延不答

    赫鲁晓夫复函欧洲反核军备委员会主席
    苏联坚持永远停止核试验
    美英在不继续核试验会议上对苏联建议拖延不答
    新华社30日讯　据塔斯社28日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫6月24日写信给欧洲反对核军备委员会主席里希特和副主席柯林斯说：“和从前一样，苏联准备立即毫不迟延地签订关于停止试验各种原子武器和氢武器的协议。”他说：“和过去一样，目前停止核试验完全取决于美英两国政府是否准备采取这个步骤”。
    里希特和柯林斯不久以前曾经写信给苏、美、英三国政府首脑，代表参加欧洲反对核军备委员会的各国组织，坚决要求缔结关于停止核武器试验的协定。赫鲁晓夫6月24日的信就是给他们的答复。
    里希特和柯林斯在他们给赫鲁晓夫的信中表示希望美、苏、英三国政府首脑明确表现出他们的诚意，并且在日内瓦停止核武器试验会议上取得有成效的结果。赫鲁晓夫在复信中回答说，苏联过去和现在一贯坚决支持和永远停止核试验。他说，苏联在停止核试验问题上的诚意已经不止一次地为具体事实所证明。
    新华社日内瓦29日电　本社记者张扬报道：研究如何侦察和查明高空核爆炸的工作小组今天向苏、美、英三国不继续试验核武器会议提出了一项临时报告。这项临时报告说：“工作小组目前正在准备一项最后报告，这项最后报告将尽快向停止核武器试验会议提出。”
    这个工作小组是按照停止核试验会议的指示工作的，从6月22日到29日，它已举行了七次会议。
    在这一周里，三国代表团用大部分时间讨论了监督站人员配备问题。苏联代表查拉普金为满足西方代表团的要求，建议把监督站外国专家人数由四、五人增到六、七人。
    这里的观察家认为，除了有效地侦察和查明隐蔽的爆炸以外，如果没有其他目的，人员问题不应该在双方之间产生严重分歧。根据目前的技术水平，监察问题已大大简化。侦察核爆炸的一切方法完全能够机械化和自动化，并且封闭在特别的容器里。为了防止歪曲，像苏联方面原来建议的那样，监察站上有一两名对方的代表就足够了。
    值得指出的是，苏联代表团为了满足西方的要求还是建议把外国监察人员的人数适当增加。但是西方对于苏联代表团的这种让步并没有反应。对于苏联提出的关于事前决定每年监督次数的另一项重要的建议，美国和英国代表团也没有提出积极的回答。
