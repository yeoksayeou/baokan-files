(TASS, Athens, July 14th) The Athens Military Tribunal, in its hearing of the "case" against Glezos and other defendants on the evening of the 13th and morning of the 14th, continued to hear testimonies from the defense. Due to the repeated failures of the prosecution, the court increasingly obstructed the defendants' defense. Defense lawyers had to protest more and more against this arbitrary behavior of the court. Those present at the court sometimes got the impression that the organizers of the court wanted to rush the end of the trial. In recent days, defense lawyers have proved from a legal point of view that the accusations against Glezos did not present specific evidence of espionage activities, and thus the reasons for the accusations became increasingly untenable. The court president argued that the court could even accuse someone of having the intention of engaging in espionage activities, or, more precisely… of having such a thought.

Defense lawyer Stefanakis said that in this case, the military tribunal's trial should perhaps be described as arbitrary. The court president and the prosecutor, in a threatening tone, demanded that Stefanakis withdraw this statement.

Manolis Glezos today protested the court president's frequent reference to the argument that the Greek authorities had long ago sentenced Glezos to death. Glezos believed this was an attempt to pre-judge him as a criminal. This exposed the essence of the military tribunal's new conspiracy.

On the 13th and 14th, many witnesses testified in court for Glezos, including workers, housewives, lawyers, and political activists. They all repeatedly spoke of the defendant's noble morality and patriotism.

Dimitrokalis, the father of Glezos' sister, Doriani Tu, who testified in court today, presented some additional materials that completely exposed the police's fabrication that Glezos had met with Korianis. In the police's lawsuit, it was insisted that Glezos had a meeting with Korianis in a house on German Street in Athens, and left the house at noon on August 17. Dimitrokalis said that Glezos had already arrived in the town of Rafina in the suburbs of Athens with his family to spend the holiday at 11:00 AM on August 17. The defense lawyer asked, "Since Glezos was in Rafina at that time, how could he also be in the house on German Street?" At this time, the court president unreasonably interrupted the defense lawyer's speech again.

The chairman of the United Democratic Left Party, Passalidis, refuted the court president's claim that Glezos could conduct "espionage activities" behind the back of the United Democratic Left Party. Passalidis said that Glezos had no secrets from his party, and he was completely loyal to his party.

In the afternoon hearing on the 14th, the well-known political activists Bakrazis and Zvolu, among others, defended Glezos. The famous Greek writer Dukas emphasized that world public opinion demands the release of the national hero Glezos. "Democratic Alliance" activist Divalis said, "As a former judge, after reading the trial materials and the indictment, I must point out that this accusation is unfounded."

The court president attempted to present the defendant's struggle against the establishment of atomic bases and missile bases on Greek territory as "evidence of engaging in espionage activities," but this attempt was firmly refuted by the defense lawyers and the defendant. The embarrassed court president had to abandon his statement.

When making a preliminary summary of the defense lawyers' testimonies, the Athens newspapers emphasized that the main purpose of the trial was to persecute the government's political opposition. Its target is not only Glezos, one of the leaders of the largest democratic party in Greece, but also, in general, the party itself.

"Dawn Daily" wrote in an article entitled "Shameful Failure" that the accusation against Glezos failed amidst the strong protests from all corners of the world. If the Greek government wants to save itself from further discrediting itself, then it should admit its failure and release Glezos.

### 希腊人民挺身为格列索斯辩护  军事法庭的诬陷被驳得体无完肤

    希腊人民挺身为格列索斯辩护
    军事法庭的诬陷被驳得体无完肤
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社雅典14日讯：审讯格列索斯和其他被告“案件”的雅典军事法庭在13日晚间和14日上午的审讯中，继续听取辩护人的证词。由于原告接连遭到失败，法庭日益对被告的辩护给以阻难。辩护人不得不对法庭的这种专横行为越来越多地提出抗议。出席法庭的人有时得到这样一种印象：法庭组织者想匆忙提前结束审讯。最近几天，辩护人从法律观点证明，在对格列索斯的控告中没有提出进行间谍活动的具体证明，于是提出控告的理由变得越来越站不住脚了。法庭庭长强辩说，法庭甚至可以因为某人有进行间谍活动的打算，或者更恰当地说……有这种念头而提出控告。
    辩护律师斯特凡纳基斯说，在这种情况下，军事法庭的审讯也许应当说成是专横。法庭庭长和检察官用威胁的语调要求斯特凡纳基斯收回这种说法。
    曼诺里斯·格列索斯今天抗议法庭庭长经常援引这样一个论据，说希腊当局早就把格列索斯判了死刑。格列索斯认为这是一个预先把他看作罪犯的企图。这样就揭露了军事法庭的新阴谋的实质。
    13日和14日，许多证人在法庭为格列索斯作证，其中有工人、家庭主妇、律师、政治活动家。他们都一再地谈到被告的崇高的道德和爱国主义精神。
    今天在法庭上作证的格列索斯的姐姐多利亚尼图的父亲迪米特罗卡利斯提出了一些补充材料，完全揭露了警察局关于格列索斯曾经会见科里雅尼斯的捏造。在警察局的诉讼中，硬说格列索斯在雅典日尔曼街的一所房子里同科里雅尼斯会谈后，于8月17日午后离开了这所房子。迪米特罗卡利斯说，8月17日上午十一点格列索斯就已经来到雅典郊区的腊菲纳镇和家人一同过假日。辩护人问：“格列索斯当时在腊菲纳怎么会同时又在日尔曼街的房子里呢？”这时法庭庭长又无理打断辩护人的发言。
    统一民主左翼党主席帕萨利德斯驳斥了法庭庭长所谓格列索斯可以瞒着统一民主左翼党进行“间谍活动”的说法，帕萨利德斯说，格列索斯对自己的党没有任何秘密，他对自己的党是完全忠诚的。
    在14日下午的审讯中，为格列索斯辩护的有著名的政治活动家巴克拉济斯、兹伏露等人。希腊著名作家杜卡斯强调指出，世界公众都要求释放民族英雄格列索斯。“民主联盟”的活动家迪瓦里斯说，我作为一个过去的法官，在看过审讯材料和起诉书之后必须指出，这场控告是毫无根据的。
    法庭庭长企图提出被告反对在希腊领土上建立原子基地和火箭基地的斗争作为“进行间谍活动的证据”，但是，他的这个企图受到辩护人和被告的坚决驳斥。处境狼狈的庭长不得不放弃了自己的说法。
    雅典报纸在对辩护人的证词作初步总结时强调指出，审讯的主要目的是迫害政府的政治反对派。它的矛头不仅是针对希腊最大的民主政党的领导人之一格列索斯，而且一般说来，也是针对这个党本身。
    “黎明日报”在一篇题为“可耻的失败”的文章中写道，对格列索斯的控告在全世界各个角落发出的强大的抗议声中失败了。如果希腊政府想挽救自己以免进一步威信扫地，那么，它就应当承认自己的失败和释放格列索斯。（附图片）
