Serious Illiteracy Problem in the United States

According to a report in the American magazine "Newsweek," a director of the Adult Education Division of the U.S. Office of Education reported at a conference in New York State that approximately ten million adults over the age of twenty-five in the United States have an English proficiency level that qualifies them as "vocationally illiterate." Among them, about 2.5 million have never attended school. It is estimated that by 1970, the number of people who are unable to perform jobs due to insufficient education may exceed 15 million.

The illiteracy problem in the United States is particularly serious in the southern states. Florida has a relatively low illiteracy rate of 14%, while Louisiana has a high rate of 29%. Even in highly industrialized states such as Ohio and Massachusetts, there are 250,000 illiterate people in each state.

    美国文盲问题严重
    根据美国“新闻周刊”报道，美国教育局成人教育处的一位处长在纽约州召开的一次会议上报告说，目前在美国超过二十五岁的成人中约有一千万人的英文程度是属于“职业上的文盲”的。其中没有进过学校的约有二百五十万人。估计到1970年这些由于文化程度不够不能胜任工作的人，可能将超过一千五百万人。
    美国文盲问题在南部各州尤为严重。文盲比例较低的是佛罗里达州达14％，高的是路易斯安那州达29％。即使在高度工业化的俄亥俄州和马萨诸塞州，文盲人数也各有二十五万人。
