Title: What American Doctors Cannot See

An American doctor, after visiting the Soviet exhibition of scientific, technological, and cultural achievements, said: "The concern of the state for the health of its people to such an extent is something unheard of in our country. No wonder there are so few people with nervous disorders in the Soviet Union, but in our country, there are millions of neurotics."

This American doctor, in fact, only got half of it right. A country's concern for the health of its people, advanced medical equipment, free medical care, and inexpensive, well-equipped sanatoriums are certainly important reasons for reducing disease. However, the decisive factor is still the social system and the people's living conditions. Neurosis, called hysteria in traditional Chinese medicine, "social conditions are of great significance for the occurrence and frequency of hysterical neurosis. The more the development of personality is suppressed in certain social relations, the more pronounced and frequent hysteria becomes... Therefore, hysteria is very common in capitalist societies. In the situation of socialist society, the conditions conducive to the occurrence of hysteria do not exist at all."
(See "Neurology," page 360, People's Medical Publishing House edition)

Not to mention times further back, in May of this year, an "U.S. News & World Report" reporter wrote a report after traveling all over the United States. Here are a few excerpts:

"When the reporter asked people what bothered them the most, people answered one after another, 'money,' or 'how to make ends meet.' This is what people of all ages and all walks of life are worrying about.

"The sharp rise in local and state taxes is like adding salt to the wounds of taxpayers. A foreman at an auto repair shop said: 'Every politician promises to lower taxes when seeking office, but every politician raises taxes once they get the job.'

"The manager of the First National Bank of Hamilton, Ohio, warned people to pay attention to a real danger. He said: 'Some people are simply obsessed with securities.'

...Market analyst White said: 'The mood on Wall Street today reflects a state of mind, that is, people increasingly believe that inflation has become an unstoppable force in the national economy.'"

Exorbitant taxes, inflation, and unemployment debt are like poisonous snakes,缠绕and gnawing at the broad masses of working people in the United States every day. On the other hand, there is the so-called American "culture" flooding like a deluge, such as comic strips and books, movies, and television that promote war, encourage murder and arson, and teach indecency, as well as crazy jitterbug dances, etc., which are increasingly corrupting and poisoning the spirit of the American people. American writer Bonowsky said: "The contradiction between the ruling class's pursuit of war and enslavement and the people's desire for peace and democracy distorts the entire life of the United States. Therefore, our youth are mentally declining, people live in a muddle-headed state, and large numbers of people suffer from neurasthenia..." This is a penetrating exposure of the root cause of the increasing number of neurotic patients in the United States. This is an incurable "social cancer." Naturally, that American doctor cannot see it, and even if he could, he would be powerless.

As early as 1918, Lu Xun warned in his "Diary of a Madman" the group of people who were preparing to label someone as a madman and then eat him as an "evil person": "If you don't change, you will be eaten up yourselves. Even if you have many offspring, you will be eliminated by real people, just like hunters kill wolf cubs! - Like insects!" People remember that former U.S. Secretary of Defense Forrestal, due to his enthusiasm for atomic war, eventually went mad and jumped to his death. Former U.S. Air Force Major Eatherly, who led U.S. bombers to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, with atomic bombs on the eve of the end of World War II, killing 300,000 Japanese civilians, has also repeatedly suffered mental breakdowns and has been admitted to mental hospitals several times. Those who drive others mad go mad themselves, and those who eat others are eaten themselves. Isn't this an increasingly obvious trend?

    美国医生所看不见的
    姚人为
    一位美国医生在参观了苏联科学、技术和文化成就展览会以后说：“国家对自己的人民健康竟能如此关心，这在我国是没有听见过的事，难怪在苏联患神经病的人很少，可是在我们这里，却有成百万的神经病患者。”
    这位美国医生，其实只说对了一半。一个国家关心自己人民的健康，有先进的医疗器械，有免费医疗，有取费低廉、设备最好的休养处所，这些固然是足以减少疾病的一个重要原因，但是，起决定作用的还是社会制度和人民生活状况。神经病，中医叫癔病，“对癔病性神经机能病的发生和频率而言，社会条件具有莫大意义。在一定社会关系中，性格的发展被压抑得越甚，癔病亦表现得越强、越多见。……所以癔病在资本主义社会中十分多见。在社会主义社会的情形中，有利于癔病发生的条件毫不存在。”
  （见“神经病学”第360页，人民卫生出版社版）
    时间较远的且不说，今年5月，“美国新闻与世界报道”记者在旅行全美国后写了一篇报道，这里不妨摘录几段：
      “当记者向人们问起他最伤脑筋的事情是什么的时候，人们一个接着一个回答说‘钱’，或者‘如何入能敷出’，这正是各阶层的老老少少正在伤脑筋的事情。
    “地方和州的赋税的急骤上升好比是在付税人的伤口上加上一把盐。一个汽车修配厂的领班说：‘每一个政治家在谋取职位时总是答应要减低税收，可是每一个政治家职位到手以后却是增加税收’。
    “俄亥俄州汉密尔顿第一国民银行的经理警告人们注意一种真正的危险。他说：‘有些人简直对证券如痴如狂’。
    ……市场分析员怀特说：‘华尔街今天的情绪反映了一种思想情况，那就是，人们日益相信通货膨胀已经成了国民经济中的一个不可遏止的力量。’”
    苛捐杂税、通货膨胀、失业借债像毒蛇一般每天在纠缠和啃啮着美国广大的劳苦人民，这是一方面；另一方面又有洪水般泛滥着的那种所谓美国“文化”，例如宣传战争、鼓励杀人放火、诲盗诲淫的连环图画和书刊、电影和电视，还有疯狂的阿飞舞等等，也正在与日俱增地腐蚀和毒害美国人民的精神。美国作家鲍诺斯基说：“统治阶级追求战争、奴役和人民渴望和平、民主之间的矛盾把整个美国的生活歪曲了。因此我们的青年精神衰退，人们浑浑噩噩的过日子，人们大批大批的神经衰弱……。”这是一针见血地说穿了美国神经病患者所以越来越多的根本原因。这是一个不可救药的“社会癌症”，自然，那位美国医生是看不见的，即便能看见也是无能为力。
    鲁迅先生早在1918年写的“狂人日记”里，警告过预备给人家下一个疯子的名目然后把他当作“恶人”吃掉的那一伙人：“你们要不改，自己也会吃尽。即使生得多，也会给真的人除灭了，同猎人打完狼子一样！——同虫子一样！”人们记得美国前国防部长福莱斯特由于热中于原子战争，终于发疯跳楼自杀了。第二次世界大战结束前夕率领美国轰炸机以原子弹轰炸日本广岛与长崎、杀伤三十万日本平民的美国前空军少校埃瑟莱，也一再神经失常，被关进精神病院已有好几次了。逼人疯者自疯，吃人者自吃，这难道不是越来越明显的趋势吗？
