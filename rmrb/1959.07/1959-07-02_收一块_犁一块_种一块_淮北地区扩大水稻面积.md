Xinhua News Agency, Hefei. The Huaibei region of Anhui Province is actively expanding its rice planting area. As of June 24, the eight counties in the Huaibei area under the Fuyang and Bengbu special districts had transplanted more than 4.3 million mu of rice, equivalent to the area planted with mid-season rice last year. Currently, all localities are seizing the remaining ten days or so to continue rush planting.

The Huaibei region has made many preparations for expanding the rice planting area. As early as last winter and this spring, many communes carried out large-scale water conservancy and water storage projects to prepare water sources for expanding rice planting. In light of the characteristics of this year's large rice planting area and tight schedule, all counties in the Fuyang special district made early arrangements for land, labor, and animal power, and prepared water lifting tools. After the summer harvest began, all localities harvested while planting, harvesting a piece, plowing a piece, and planting a piece. In Suixi County, not only did more than 1,100 rice specialized teams harvest and plant simultaneously during the summer harvest, but also, after the summer harvest was basically completed, 80% of the county's labor force was concentrated on a rush planting campaign. As a result, the task of transplanting 410,000 mu of rice was completed more than 20 days ahead of schedule.

In order to complete the plan to expand rice planting quickly and well, all parts of Huaibei have universally strengthened political leadership and technical training. The Suixi County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party dispatched county committee members, ministers, and other responsible cadres to participate in specific leadership in key areas for converting to rice cultivation. The Fuyang special district held short-term training classes at all levels, training more than 170,000 technical backbones for rice planting, and adopted methods such as holding on-site meetings, mutual teaching and learning, master-apprentice pairings, or learning while working in the fields to improve the rice planting skills of commune members. Therefore, the quality of rice planted in the Huaibei region this year is very good, the rice fields are thoroughly and evenly prepared, and rational close planting has been universally promoted.

    收一块　犁一块　种一块
    淮北地区扩大水稻面积
    据新华社合肥电　安徽省淮北地区积极扩大水稻种植面积。到6月24日止，阜阳专区和蚌埠专区的淮北八县已经栽插水稻四百三十多万亩，等于去年中稻插秧面积。目前各地正抓紧剩余的十几天时间继续抢插。
    淮北地区曾为扩大水稻种植面积作了许多准备工作。早在去冬今春，许多公社就大修水利和蓄水保水，为扩种水稻准备水源条件。根据今年种稻面积大、时间紧等特点，阜阳专区各县都及早地安排了土地、劳力、畜力，准备了提水工具。到了夏收开始后，各地就边收边种，收一块、犁一块、栽一块。濉溪不仅有一千一百多个水稻专业队在夏收中边收边种，而且在夏收基本结束后，又集中全县80％劳力突击抢栽，结果提前二十多天完成了四十一万亩水稻插秧任务。
    为了又快又好地完成扩大水稻种植计划，淮北各地普遍加强了政治领导和技术培训工作。中共濉溪县委抽调县委委员、部长等负责干部，到改种水稻的重点地区参加具体领导。阜阳专区逐级举办了短期训练班，培养种植水稻的技术骨干十七万多人，并且采取召开现场会议、互教互学、以师带徒或在田间边干边学等办法，提高社员种植水稻的技术。所以，今年淮北地区栽的水稻质量很好，稻田整的透，整的匀，并普遍推行了合理密植。
