　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 29th. Commercial staff in the Shangqing Temple area of Chongqing are assigned to specific locations and go deep into the masses, selling goods and doing mass work, doing everything possible to help the masses arrange their economic lives. In the past six months, many commercial staff in this area have become good advisors and consultants for the lives of the masses, and are loved by the broad masses of residents.

　　The Shangqing Temple area Comprehensive Retail Store manages the commercial network in this area, including more than 170 business points such as retail outlets and catering service stores, undertaking the material supply and life service work for more than 60,000 people. This year, according to the requirement that economic work should be done more and more meticulously, the Shangqing Temple area Comprehensive Retail Store branch of the Chinese Communist Party led commercial staff to go deep into the masses, rely on the masses to do commercial work well, and better serve consumers.

　　The fifty salespeople in the dried vegetable and non-staple food outlets in each area are generally busier in the morning and more idle in the afternoon. Each outlet has adopted the method of assigning people to specific locations and dividing areas to be responsible for, often taking advantage of the idle time of selling goods to take turns going deep into the forty-eight residential sections to understand the needs of the masses. After the local masses set up forty-four street public canteens, they lacked experience in how to run collective meals well, and some canteen chefs also had poor cooking skills. The area store sent five of the best chefs and three catering store managers with management experience to patrol the residential sections to help street canteens arrange grain and dishes, teach cooking skills, and establish various simple management systems. Grain store employees promoted the method of steaming rice with cold water and raw rice in various street canteens, which improved the rice yield. The Shangqing Temple Twelfth Residential Section Public Canteen and the Renmin Road Eighth Residential Section Public Canteen originally had unsound systems, no planned use of grain, low income, and high expenditure, and the canteen staff shouted that they could not continue to run it. With the help of grain stores and store staff, a good grain use plan was arranged, grain was saved, and cooking skills were improved, and the masses were very satisfied with the canteen. Now, the street public canteens in this area are all contracted by state-owned restaurants and catering stores to help improve technology and improve management. After the street canteens were run well, the state-owned restaurants were not so crowded.

　　The Shangqing Temple area store also helped the masses establish their own service network. After many housewives participated in production and construction, they had less time to take care of housework such as drinking water, washing clothes, sewing, and bathing. In addition to building new and expanding state-owned service industry business points, the Shangqing Temple area store also helped the streets establish eight "tiger stoves" supplying boiling water and hot water, and took the initiative to contact collective catering groups to supply boiling water and hot water; for the elderly, weak, disabled, and residents with limited mobility, they also implemented water delivery to their homes. At the same time, commercial personnel assisted the streets in setting up life service stations, and trained service personnel such as barbers for the streets. At present, these service stations have established more than twenty service teams according to the streets, including laundry, sewing, repair, shoe shining, sock making, letter writing, and mobile hairdressing. From demolition and renovation, mending clothes and nailing buttons, to making children's clothes and shoes, everything is complete, which is convenient for the masses. Recently, the weather in Chongqing has been extremely hot, and commercial personnel have helped the masses establish simple shower rooms and institutions for supplying cool drinks.

　　Many salespeople in this area often helped the masses clean up, cook, and do housework when they went to the residential sections to sell goods, and publicized policies to the masses. They became friends of the masses. Many residents wrote letters praising the commercial staff for their spirit of serving the masses. When salespeople picked goods to go to the residential sections, the masses automatically helped the salespeople weigh, sell, and collect money. This spring, when a large number of fresh vegetables were on the market and needed to be processed urgently, the masses immediately vacated more than 800 jars and earthen pots for the store to use. Whenever there was a large supply of materials during festivals, many masses helped the store process, package, and transport goods. (Attached picture)

　　When the elderly living in the Shangqing Temple area talk about the commercial department, they always smile. The service staff of the commercial department are afraid that the elderly will not be able to climb slopes and steps conveniently, and even provide boiling water to their homes.

    上清寺地区商业人员既售货又做群众工作
    营业员成为群众生活顾问
    他们帮助街道居民办好了食堂建立了服务站
    本报重庆29日电　重庆市上清寺地区综合零售商店的工作人员定人定点深入群众，既售货，又做群众工作，千方百计帮助群众安排经济生活。半年来，这个地区的许多商业工作人员已经成为群众生活的好参谋、好顾问，受到广大居民的爱戴。
    上清寺地区综合商店管理着这个地区的商业网，包括零售门市部、饮食服务商店等一百七十多个营业点，担负六万多人口的物资供应和生活服务工作。中共上清寺地区综合零售商店支部今年根据经济工作愈做愈细致的要求，领导商业工作人员深入群众，依靠群众做好商业工作，为消费者更好地服务。
    各个地段干菜副食品门市部的五十名售货员一般早晨比较忙，下午比较清闲。各个门市部就采取定人定点分片包干的办法，经常趁售货清闲时间，轮流深入四十八个居民段去了解群众需要。当地群众办起四十四个街道公共食堂以后，对如何搞好集体伙食缺乏经验，有些食堂的厨师烹调技术也不好。地区商店便派出五名最好的厨师和三名有管理经验的饮食店门市部主任巡回到居民段帮助街道食堂安排用粮和菜肴，传授烹调技术，建立各种简易的管理制度。粮店职工在各个街道食堂中推广冷水生米蒸饭法，提高了出饭率。上清寺十二居民段公共食堂和人民路第八居民段公共食堂，原来制度不健全，用粮没有计划，收入少，支出多，食堂工作人员叫喊办不下去了。在粮店和商店工作人员帮助下，安排好用粮计划，粮食有了节余，提高了烹调技术，群众对食堂很满意。现在，这个地区的街道公共食堂，都由国营餐厅、饮食店分片包干帮助提高技术、改善管理工作。街道食堂办好以后，国营餐厅也不那么拥挤了。
    上清寺地区商店还帮助群众自己建立了服务网。许多家庭妇女参加生产建设以后，料理喝水、洗衣、缝补、洗澡等家务事的时间少了。上清寺地区商店除新建和扩大国营服务行业的营业点外，还帮助街道建立供应开水和热水的老虎灶八个，并主动联系集体伙食团供应开水、热水；对老弱残废行动不便的居民，还实行送水到家。同时，商业人员协助街道办起了生活服务站，为街道培养了理发员等服务人员。目前，这些服务站已经按街道成立了洗衣、缝补、修配、擦皮鞋、做袜底、代写书信、流动理发等二十多个服务小组。从拆旧翻新、补衣钉扣，到做童衣、童鞋样样齐全，群众称便。最近重庆气候酷热，商业人员已帮助群众建立了简易淋浴室和供应清凉饮料的机构。
    这个地区的许多售货员在下居民段售货时，经常帮助群众打扫清洁、煮饭和做家务杂事，向群众宣传政策，他们成了群众的朋友。许多居民写信表扬商业人员为群众服务的精神。售货员挑货下居民段时，群众自动帮售货员过秤、售货、收款。今年春季鲜菜大量上市，急需加工，群众马上腾出八百多个坛子、瓦缸交给商店使用。每逢节日物资供应量大，许多群众都帮商店加工、包装商品和运货。（附图片）
    住在上清寺地区的老年人一谈起商业部门，总是喜笑颜开。商业部门的服务员怕老年人上坡下坎不方便，连开水也供应上门。新华社记者　刘诗临摄
