The Restoration and Development of Oil-Tea Camellia Production in the Last Decade
The Chinese Communist Party, Pingxiang County Committee, Jiangxi Province

    Our county is a hilly area, with a total area of 3,720,000 mu, of which 2,930,000 mu are mountainous and forested, and 690,000 mu are cultivated land. The climate is mild, rainfall is abundant, and the soil is fertile, making it ideal for oil-tea camellia growth. The masses have a long-standing habit and experience in managing and cultivating oil-tea camellias. The county currently has over 800,000 mu of oil-tea camellia forests, including over 190,000 mu of young forests and over 75,000 mu of sparse forests, accounting for about 30% of the county's total mountainous and forested area. Before the war, the annual output reached 6 million jin. However, due to the long-term destruction by the Kuomintang reactionaries, the oil-tea camellia forests became barren year by year, and the output sharply decreased. By the time of liberation, the county's oil-tea camellia output had decreased by nearly 80% compared to pre-war levels.

    After liberation, under the correct leadership and attention of the higher-level Party and government, our county has made certain achievements in actively organizing and mobilizing the masses to cultivate and repair oil-tea camellia mountains and restore and develop oil-tea camellia production.

    In the past few years, a total of over 1,700,000 mu of oil-tea camellia mountains have been cultivated and repaired, including over 500,000 mu of restored land (based on the total cultivated area each year).  In the old oil-tea camellia forests, young trees have been planted to fill gaps, and over 190,000 mu of young forests have been developed. As a result, oil-tea camellia production has increased year by year. Last year, the county's oil-tea camellia production reached 6 million jin, an increase of 3.6 times compared to 1950. Due to continuous cultivation and nurturing, not only has the planted area increased, but the yield per unit area has also significantly improved. According to a survey of a 13.6 mu tea mountain in the Victory Brigade of the Chishan Commune, after renovation, an average of 75 dan of tea peaches were harvested each year, regardless of good or bad years, yielding over 600 jin of oil, with a yield of 46 jin per mu. This proves that cultivating tea mountains has a significant effect on increasing production. It can also prove that our county's oil-tea camellia production still has great potential.

    Why has the restoration and development of oil-tea camellia production in our county been so rapid?

    I. Listed as an Important Task

    Oil-tea camellia is an important product of our county and a major source of income for our farmers, especially those in the old revolutionary base areas. Vigorously cultivating and developing oil-tea camellia production is not only an important measure to restore and develop the national economy, increase income, and improve living standards, but also an important political task to care for the production and lives of the people in the old revolutionary base areas. After liberation, the county's Party and government leading departments, while vigorously developing agricultural production, have consistently regarded leading oil-tea camellia production as an important task from beginning to end. Under the slogan of "Vigorously cultivate, actively develop, dig every three years, repair every year, increase production in mature mountains, and not allow barren mountains to become barren again," the county committee adopted the methods of assigning responsibility to each area, personally taking action, and conducting inspections and evaluations to continuously strengthen the sense of responsibility of leaders at all levels. The economic and technical support provided to farmers is also substantial. Since liberation, a total of 318,000 yuan in oil-tea camellia loans and over 12,000 yuan in subsidies have been issued, effectively solving the problems of seeds, tools, and living expenses arising in the development of oil-tea camellia production. Appropriate subsidies were also provided in a timely manner for the high labor intensity of cultivating tea mountains and the excessive grain consumption.  On the basis of solving these problems, we conducted publicity and education aimed at some ideological problems existing among cadres and the masses, explaining the political and economic significance of developing oil-tea camellia production, and specifically analyzing the favorable conditions and necessity of cultivating oil-tea camellia mountains. This improved the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses, and the masses consciously took action, went to the mountains to set up camps, assigned special personnel to be responsible, and protected the tea mountains in all seasons.

    II. Correctly Handling Remuneration Issues

    Starting from the long-term interests and proceeding from the current interests, correctly handling remuneration is an effective way to mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses for cultivating mountains. According to our practice in recent years, there are roughly three ways to handle remuneration: 1. For units with large tasks, many cultivation work points, and low internal income, the bank provides appropriate loans to pay members 50% of the cultivation work points in cash, and the other half is recorded in the work point manual for participation in the year-end distribution. 2. Units where the proportion of forestry and sideline income is not large, but the cultivation of oil-tea camellia mountains does not exceed 10% of the total work points of the community, also participate in the current year's distribution. 3. For units where forestry and sideline income is too small, and the cultivation of oil-tea camellia mountains exceeds 10% of the total work points of the community, the excess portion can be deposited at the base point and repaid within three years. The adoption of the above measures effectively eliminated the concerns of some cadres and the masses and increased their enthusiasm for cultivating and restoring oil-tea camellia mountains. The original Tangxi Senior Cooperative in Guanpi Township had more than 1,500 mu of barren mountains that had not been cultivated for many years. In 1956, the first method was adopted, and more than 800 mu were cultivated within one year. The members generally reflected: "This method is really good, it not only earns cash, but also develops tea mountains." After summarizing these experiences in various places, we not only promoted them but also formally used them as regulations in income distribution, prompting various places to list cultivation as an important production task for members, opposing egalitarianism and uncompensated rush work. This has played a powerful role in mobilizing the masses to cultivate and restore oil-tea camellia mountains.

    III. Rational Arrangement of Labor

    Oil-tea camellia production requires a large amount of labor. If the planning arrangement is improper, it will also create competition for work between forestry and agriculture. Therefore, only by rationally arranging labor and rationally arranging time can we better mobilize all forces to invest in oil-tea camellia production. According to the natural conditions and the habits of the masses, there are roughly three methods used in various places in our county: unified planning, integrating scattered efforts; concentrating all efforts, short-term blitz; promoting mixed forestry and agriculture, increasing grain production, and saving labor for mountain repair. In mountainous areas where there are many tasks and few people, after calculating the agricultural tasks that each laborer should bear each year, the surplus time is uniformly allocated for oil-tea camellia cultivation and development of oil-tea camellia forests according to the strength of the labor force, dividing areas for contract responsibility, fixing areas, conducting regular inspections, and setting time limits for completion. This allows the masses to have more freedom to control their time and make full use of their spare time to cultivate piecemeal, integrating scattered efforts into a whole. This is a better way to solve the problem of scarce labor and scattered residences in mountainous areas. In communities and teams in plains with many mountains and many people, measures are taken to seize the season, prepare tools, and mobilize all people to go to the mountains, delineate tasks, launch short-term blitzes, and complete tasks on schedule. Plains are easy to concentrate and easy to unify actions. Adopting this method takes less time and yields quick results. In sparse forest areas, we have vigorously promoted mixed forestry and agriculture based on the masses' long-standing habit of planting sweet potatoes in oil-tea camellia forests.

    IV. "Four Fixes, One Guarantee" with Rewards and Penalties

    In order to effectively carry out the cultivation work, the "Four Fixes" and "One Guarantee" method are mostly adopted in management. The "Four Fixes" are: "Fixed Work": According to the amount of work required for mountain clearing in the past, the degree of barrenness, the looseness of the soil, the difficulty of cultivation, and the distance, determine the work points required for each mountain. "Fixed Quantity": According to the number of laborers in each team and group, in addition to agricultural labor, based on the tasks of the entire community, specifically allocate to teams, groups, and laborers (but taking into account the principles of proximity of residence and convenience of cultivation to prevent the phenomenon of competing for good mountains, abandoning bad mountains, competing for near mountains, and abandoning distant mountains), so that each laborer clearly understands the tasks that they should cultivate each year. "Fixed Quality": Middle cultivation should be two to three inches deep, wasteland reclamation should be five to seven inches deep, small bamboo should be turned over, weeds should be removed, reeds should be uprooted, and rushes should be turned over to prevent shoddy work of digging a shovel and covering it up. "Fixed Time": According to the specific situation of the labor force and tasks of each team and group, different times are proposed for completing the tasks. One Guarantee: namely, guaranteed management: Each team and group should regularly be responsible for checking the quality, quantity, completion time, and whether the cultivation has damaged tea forest seedlings.

    On the basis of doing a good job in the four fixes and one guarantee, the system of rewards and punishments is also implemented. Those who produce well will get more; those who do not produce well will be criticized.

    V. Implementing Several Technical Measures

    Annual cultivation is an important link to ensure increased production. The masses reflected: "Tea mountains do not need fertilizer, just peel off a layer of skin every year," and "Digging gold in July and digging silver in August" fully illustrates the importance of continuous cultivation and seizing the season for cultivation. The tea mountains in our county can generally be repaired once a year and dug every three years. When cultivating barren tea mountains, it is best to cut down weeds and shrubs in the winter and spring slack season each year, dig up the firewood roots, and then cultivate again in July and August of the same year or the following year. The depth of mountain clearing varies according to the depth of the soil in the mountain, limited to not harming the roots of the trees, generally clearing two to three inches deep. The sod that is cleared on the sunny mountains should not be taken for agricultural fertilizer. One should not only care about the thousand-jin mu and lose the money tree, but should nourish the mountain with the mountain and pile the sod under the tea tree as fertilizer. When cultivating, it is also necessary to combine pruning. Oil-tea camellias not only need fertile soil and even rainfall, but also need ventilation in the forest to produce more solid fruit and higher oil content. The methods of cultivating oil-tea camellias must be adapted to local conditions and pay attention to soil and water conservation, and should not be uniform.

    Picking in time and according to local conditions to improve quality. The tea seeds should be picked according to the tree species, and it should not be too early, because the tea seeds have a strong seasonality when they mature, and picking too early will reduce the oil yield. Generally, it is best to let them fully mature on flat mountains and let them fall, using the sweeping method, but on steep mountains, it should not be too late. If the tea seeds crack and fall on the mountain, it is not easy to pick them up, which will reduce the harvest. When picking tea seeds, attention should also be paid to protecting the branches and protecting the newly formed flower buds, so as not to affect the fruit setting in the next year and cause reduced production.

    Developing oil-tea camellia forests to ensure survival rate. In recent years, our county has developed more than 190,000 mu of oil-tea camellia forests. According to the experience of various places, in direct seeding, special attention should be paid to preventing rat damage. Selecting seeds is also an important link in improving the survival rate. Generally, red tea peaches with good fruit setting, high oil content, and smooth and full color should be selected in mountain fields with sufficient sunshine and lush growth. It is best to sow as soon as they are picked to reduce the difficulty of storing seeds, and special attention should be paid to preventing the seeds from being exposed to the sun. In order to improve the survival rate, it is also necessary to strengthen the nurturing of young forests. The nurturing season is best in late spring and early summer. Young forests that have been nurtured grow vigorously and have enhanced resistance to snow pressure and wind damage.

    Strengthening management and preventing disasters. Our county has always had the habit of strictly managing tea mountains. The tea associations in the past were mass organizations dedicated to managing tea mountains. The current mountain and forest management committees and production management committees also take the management of tea mountains as their central content. In large oil-tea camellia forest areas, generally 10% of the total income is drawn as management fees, managed by special personnel, divided into sections and areas, and managed all year round. In the plains area, there is also a combination with the management of water conservancy projects, with unified remuneration in agricultural income. There are generally specific regulations for protecting tea mountains. In the past few years, our county has not caused major disasters, and these regulations have played a certain role. We must further promote these beneficial management methods.

    Now, the oil-tea camellia cultivation work has basically ended, and the people of the whole county are moving towards annual cultivation and repair, strengthening management, eliminating the difference between large and small years, and increasing the yield per unit area. Our plan is to develop tea forests to one million mu by 1962 and reach a total output of 12 million jin. This year, between July and August, the people of our county will also combine rational cultivation and repair to do a good job in harvesting, and use a greater harvest as a gift to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the great motherland.

    十年来油茶生产的恢复和发展
    中共江西萍乡县委会
    我县是丘陵地区，全县总面积三百七十二万余亩，其中山林面积二百九十三万余亩，耕地面积六十九万余亩，气候温和，雨量充沛，土质肥沃，最适宜油茶生长。群众有长期经营培植油茶的习惯和经验。全县现有油茶林八十万余亩，其中幼林十九万余亩。稀疏林七万五千余亩，占全县总山林面积的30％左右，在战前的年产量曾达六百万斤，但由于国民党反动派的长期破坏，油茶林逐年荒芜，产量锐减，到解放时，全县油茶产量比战前减少近80％。
    解放后，在上级党政的正确领导和重视下，我县在积极组织和发动群众垦修油茶山，恢复和发展油茶生产方面，取得了一定成绩。
    几年来共垦修油茶山一百七十万余亩，其中垦复五十余万亩（按各年垦修面积的总和）。并在老油茶林中填空补蔸种植幼树和发展幼林十九万余亩。因而油茶产量逐年提高。到去年，全县油茶产量已达六百万斤，比1950年增长三点六倍。由于不断的垦修培育，不但增产面积大，而且单位面积产量也有了显著提高。据赤山公社胜利大队一块十三点六亩茶山的调查，经过铲修后，不分大小年平均每年收茶桃七十五担，榨油六百余斤，每亩产量达到四十六斤。这就证明：垦修茶山，对提高产量是有显著功效的。也可以证明，我县油茶生产还有很大潜在力量。
    为什么我县油茶生产的恢复和发展具有较快的速度呢？
    一、列为一项重要工作
    油茶是我县一项重要出产，也是我县农民，特别是老根据地农民的一笔主要收入。大力垦修和发展油茶生产不仅是恢复发展国民经济、增加收入、改善生活的一项重要措施，而且是关心老根据地人民生产、生活的一项重要政治工作。解放以后，县的党政领导部门在大力发展农业生产的同时，自始至终地把领导油茶生产作为一项重要工作。在“大力垦修，积极发展，三年一挖，一年一修，熟山提高产量，荒山不让再荒”的口号下，县委采取分片包干，亲自动手，检查评比的办法，不断加强各级领导的责任心。在经济上和技术上给予农民的支援也是很大的。解放以来共发放油茶贷款三十一万八千元，补助费一万二千多元，有力地解决了在发展油茶生产中产生的种子、工具、生活等方面的问题。对垦修茶山劳动强度大，粮食消耗超过定额的，也及时给予适当补助。在解决这些问题的基础上，我们又针对当时干部群众存在的一些思想问题，进行宣传教育，说明发展油茶生产的政治意义和经济意义，并具体分析垦修油茶山的有利条件和必要性。因而提高了干部、群众的积极性，群众都自觉地行动起来，上山扎营，专人负责，四季保护茶山。
    二、正确处理报酬问题
    从长远利益着眼，从目前利益着手，正确处理报酬，是调动群众垦山积极性的有效办法。根据我们几年来的实践，处理报酬大体上有三种办法：一、任务大，垦修工分多，社内收入少的单位，由银行给予适当贷款，付给社员垦修工分50％现金，另一半记入工分手册，参加年终分配。二、林副业收入比重不大，但垦修油茶山工分未超过全社总工分的10％的单位，也参加当年分配。三、林副业收入过小，而垦修油茶山工分超过全社总工分的10％以上的单位，可将超出部分按底分摊存，在三年内偿还。由于采取了以上措施，有效地消除了部分干部和群众的顾虑，提高了垦复油茶山的积极性。原官陂乡塘溪高级社，全社有一千五百多亩荒山，多年没有垦修，1956年采用了第一种办法，一年内就垦修了八百余亩。社员较普遍地反映说：“这种办法真正好，既赚了现金，又开发了茶山。”我们在总结各地这些经验以后，不仅加以推广，而且正式作为收入分配中的规定，促使各地把垦复列为社员一项重要的生产，反对平均主义和不计报酬一窝蜂的作法。这对发动群众垦复油茶山，起到了有力的作用。
      三、合理安排劳动力
    油茶生产需要大量劳动力，如计划安排不当，也会产生林农争工现象。因此，只有合理安排劳动力，合理安排时间，才能更好地调动一切力量投入油茶生产。我县各地根据自然条件和群众的习惯，大体上有三种办法：统一筹划，集零为整；集中全力，短期突击；推广林农混作，增加粮食产量，节省修山劳动力。在事多人少的山区，在算清每个劳动力每年应负担的农事后，把多余时间按劳动力强弱，统一分配油茶垦修和发展油茶林任务，划片包干，固定地区，定期检查，限期完成。这样使群众更能自由支配时间，并充分利用业余时间，零星垦修，集零为整，这是解决山区劳动力少，居住分散的较好办法。在平原山多人也多的社队，采取抓紧季节，准备好工具，全民上山，划定任务，短期突击，按期完成。平原易于集中，易于统一行动，采用这种方法，时间短，收效快。在疏林地区，我们根据群众历来有在油茶林栽种甘薯的习惯，大力推广了林农混作。
  四、“四定一包”有奖有惩
    为了切实做好垦复工作，在管理方法上，大都采用了“四定”“一包”的方法。“四定”是：“定工”：按历来铲山需工量，荒芜程度，土质松硬，垦修难易，距离远近，确定每块山所需要的工分。“定量”：按各队组劳力多少，除农业用工外，根据全社任务，具体分配到队、组，到劳动力，（但要照顾到居住远近，垦修方便的原则，防止争好山，丢坏山，争近山，丢远山的现象）使每个劳动力明确自己每年应垦的任务。“定质”：中耕二至三寸深，垦荒山五至七寸深，有小竹要翻鞭，有杂草要除蔸，有芦毛要除根，有芦箕要翻鞭，防止挖一铲盖一铲的偷工减料现象。“定时”：根据各队、组劳动力、任务具体情况，提出完成任务的不同时间。一包：即包管理：各队组应经常负责检查质量、数量、完成时间，和铲修是否有损坏茶林幼苗等。
    在作好四定一包的基础上，还贯彻了奖励和惩罚制度，生产好的，多产多得；生产不好的，给以批评。
    五、贯彻几项技术措施
  做到每年垦修，是保证提高产量的重要环节。群众反映：“茶山不要肥，一年剥层皮”“7月挖金，8月挖银”这充分说明了连年垦修和抓季节垦修的重要性。我县茶山一般能做到一年一修，三年一挖。在垦复荒茶山时，最好每年冬春农闲时先将杂草灌木砍除，挖去柴蔸，在同年或次年的7、8月再垦修一次。铲山深浅，根据山的土质深浅的情况各有不同，以做到不伤害树根为限，一般铲二至三寸深。在向阳的山上所铲的草皮，不要拿去做农用肥料，不能只顾千斤亩，丢掉了摇钱树，应当以山养山，将草皮堆在茶树蔸下作肥料。在垦复时还要结合进行整枝。油茶不但要土壤肥，雨水调匀，林间还要通风，才能结实多，含油量高。垦复油茶方法必须因地制宜，注意水土保持，不可千篇一律。
    因时因地采摘，提高质量。采摘茶子要看树种而定，不宜过早，因茶子成熟有强烈的季节性，过早会减少出油量。一般平山最好让其充分成熟，让其跌落，采用扫子方法，但在坡度较大的山地也不宜太迟，如到茶子开裂，落在山上，不易拣到，倒会减少收成。采摘茶子时，还应注意保护树枝，保护新结花苞，以免影响下年结实，造成减产。
    发展油茶林，保证成活率。几年来我县发展了油茶林十九万余亩，根据各地经验，在直播中，首先应该特别注意防止鼠害。选择种子也是提高成活率的重要环节，一般应在阳光充足，生长茂盛的山场选择结实好，含油量多，色泽光滑润满的红茶桃。最好作到随采随播，以减少保管种子的困难，特别注意种子不能晒。为了提高成活率，还必须加强幼林抚育工作，抚育的季节以春末夏初为好，经过抚育的幼林生长茂盛，抵抗雪压和风害的能力也增强了。
    加强管理，防止灾害。我县历年来有严格管理茶山的习惯，过去的茶会就是专管茶山的群众性的组织。现在的山林管理委员会和生产管理委员会也是以管理茶山作为中心内容。在大片的油茶林地区，一般是在总收入中抽出10％作为管理费用，专人管理，划段划片，常年管理。在平原地区，也有和保管水利工程相结合的，在农业收入中统一报酬。对保护茶山一般都有具体规定。几年来，我县没有造成大的灾害事故，这些规定起了一定的作用。这些有益的经营管理方法，我们要进一步推广。
    现在，油茶垦复工作已基本结束，全县人民正朝着年年铲修，加强经营管理，消灭大小年差别，提高单位面积产量。我们的规划，到1962年茶林发展到一百万亩，总产量达到一千二百万斤。今年7、8月间，我县人民还要结合合理铲修，做好收获工作，用更大的丰收，作为向伟大的祖国国庆十周年的献礼。（附图片）
