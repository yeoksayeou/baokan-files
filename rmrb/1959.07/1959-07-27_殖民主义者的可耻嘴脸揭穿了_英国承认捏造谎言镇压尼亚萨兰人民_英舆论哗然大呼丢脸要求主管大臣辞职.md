Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The report of the Nyasaland Commission of Inquiry, headed by Justice Devlin, published by the British government on the 23rd, confirmed that the white paper published by the British Colonial Office in March, which alleged that Africans in Nyasaland were "plotting to massacre Europeans," was a complete fabrication. The exposure of this shameful act has provoked strong criticism from British and African public opinion.

In January of this year, the people of Nyasaland launched a large-scale struggle against colonial rule, lasting more than seventy days. At that time, in order to cover up its brutal suppression, the British colonial authorities did not hesitate to fabricate facts, falsely accusing the Nyasaland African National Congress of plotting to massacre Europeans. Under this pretext, it declared a "state of emergency" throughout Nyasaland, arresting and massacring African patriots on a large scale, and the chairman of the African National Congress, Banda, was also imprisoned. However, at the time the British Colonial Office published the white paper, British public opinion exposed the fabrication of facts, and the British Colonial Secretary Lennox-Boyd was strongly criticized in the House of Commons, which forced the British government to conduct an investigation.

The report of the Commission of Inquiry now completely overturns the "massacre plot" claim. The report states that Nyasaland is a police state. There, "anyone who expresses agreement with the policies of the (Nyasaland African) National Congress is in danger... there it is unwise for anyone to express even the most cautious criticism of government policy."

Regarding Dr. Hastings Banda, the leader of the Nyasaland African National Congress, the report states: "Anyone who has seen Dr. Banda or heard him speak universally believes that attempting to implicate him in massacres and assassinations is ridiculous."

The committee said that the government used its emergency powers "to eliminate the Nyasaland African National Congress, wherever it is found."

The report said that at the time, crowds demonstrated at the docks demanding the release of their arrested leaders. The demonstrating crowds "made no attempt to achieve their goals by violence," but the army fired twenty-seven shots at them - resulting in twenty deaths and eighteen injuries.

The report said: "Although a considerable number of areas were once controlled by the people of the Nyasaland African National Congress, there was never an intention of assassination, nor was a single European killed."

British newspapers have strongly criticized the British government for fabricating the so-called "massacre plot" by the Nyasaland Africans.

The "Daily Herald," in an editorial published on the 23rd entitled "Remove This Disgrace," rebuked "those who deceived the nation with such absurd claims of a so-called massacre plot." The newspaper said, "Dr. Banda and other Nyasaland African National Congress leaders have been subjected to appalling injustice."

The prominent British journalist Michael Foot wrote in the "Daily Herald": "One of the most absurd and frightening lies ever told by the British government has been exposed." He said that the Devlin Report is one of the most serious accusations against British colonial rule in official documents. The first thing that must be done immediately is to release Dr. Banda, which is the only decent thing to do.

The "Daily Mirror" printed the following words in bold on a map of Africa that filled the front page: "Macmillan's Day of Shame."

The newspaper commented, "This is shocking news. The minister in charge should resign immediately or be dismissed. Mr. Lennox-Boyd's refusal to resign - and the Prime Minister's refusal to dismiss him - means that the entire Conservative government is now utterly disgraced."

The "Worker Daily's" editorial stated that in order to remedy the situation, we must insist on removing and expelling those who should be held responsible from the government. Such deception and brutality against innocent people must not be allowed to happen again.

Ghanaian newspapers on the 24th prominently published the report of the British government's Commission of Inquiry and published editorials.

The "Ghana Times" published an editorial saying, "The treacherous lies of imperialism have been exposed. If there was any conspiracy in Nyasaland, it was the horrific conspiracy against the leaders of the African National Congress and the followers of this party." The newspaper went on to say, "The entire Macmillan government has been condemned before the court of world opinion."

The "Evening News" published an editorial saying, "The entire inhumane and hypocritical senile system has completely collapsed, and the bombastic British Colonial Secretary must pack up his stall as a prelude to immediately clearing up the rotten remains of British imperialism in Africa."

The newspaper demanded, "Power must be transferred to the people's government immediately. Dr. Banda (Chairman of the Nyasaland African National Congress) and other African patriots should be released, apologized to, and compensated." "There can be no further justification for Welensky (Prime Minister of the Central African Federation) or Armitage (Governor of Nyasaland) to continue in power for even one more day."

    殖民主义者的可耻嘴脸揭穿了
    英国承认捏造谎言镇压尼亚萨兰人民
    英舆论哗然大呼丢脸要求主管大臣辞职
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：英国政府23日发表的以德夫林法官为首的尼亚萨兰调查委员会的报告，证实了英国殖民地部在3月间发表的所谓尼亚萨兰非洲人“策划阴谋来屠杀欧洲人”的白皮书，是彻头彻尾的捏造。这一可耻勾当的被揭穿，引起了英国和非洲舆论的猛烈抨击。
    今年1月尼亚萨兰人民发动了大规模的反殖民统治斗争，坚持达七十余天。当时英国殖民当局为了掩饰残酷的镇压暴行，竟不惜捏造事实，诬蔑尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会准备屠杀欧洲人，它并借此在尼亚萨兰全境宣布“紧急状态”，大肆逮捕和屠杀非洲爱国者，非洲人国民大会主席班达也被投入监狱。但是，在英国殖民地部公布白皮书的当时，英国舆论就揭发白皮书捏造事实，英国殖民大臣伦诺克斯—波伊德在下院受到强烈指责，这才迫使英国政府进行调查。
    现在调查委员会的报告，完全推翻了“屠杀阴谋”的说法。报告说，尼亚萨兰是一个警察国家。在那里“任何人要表示同意（尼亚萨兰非洲人）国民大会的政策都是危险的……在那里如果谁要对政府政策发表哪怕是最谨慎的批评，也是不明智的”。
    关于尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会的领袖黑斯廷斯·班达博士，报告说：“凡是看见过班达博士或者听他讲过话的人，都普遍认为企图把他牵连到屠杀和暗杀里去是荒谬可笑的。”
    委员会说，政府运用它的紧急权力，“目的是要消灭尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会，不论在那里发现它”。
    报告说，当时群众在码头上示威要求释放他们被捕的领袖。示威群众“一点也没有企图用暴力来达到他们的目的”，但是军队向他们开了二十七枪——结果死二十人，伤十八人。
    报告说：“尽管有相当多的地区曾经一度是由尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会的人控制的，但从来没有过暗杀的意图，也没有一个欧洲人被杀害。”
    英国报纸猛烈抨击英政府捏造尼亚萨兰非洲人的所谓“屠杀阴谋”。
    “每日先驱报”在23日发表的题为“消除这种耻辱”的社论中责备“那些以所谓屠杀阴谋这种荒诞无稽的说法来欺骗全国的人。”这家报纸说，“班达博士和其它尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会领袖已经受到了令人毛骨悚然的不公正的对待。”
    英国著名记者迈克尔·富特在“每日先驱报”上写道：“英国政府所说过的最荒唐和最吓人的谎言之一已经揭穿。”他说，德夫林报告是官方文件对英国殖民统治最严重的控告之一。现在第一个必须立即做到的应该是释放班达博士，这是唯一体面的办法。
    “每日镜报”在占满第一版的一幅非洲地图上印着这样几个黑体字：“麦克米伦丢脸的日子”。
    这家报纸评论说，“这是一个惊人的消息。主管大臣应当立即自动辞职或者被撤职。伦诺克斯—波伊德先生拒绝辞职——以及首相拒绝把他撤职——意味着，整个保守党政府现在已经糟糕透顶。”
    “工人日报”的社论说，我们要进行补救，必须坚持把那些应该负责的人撤职和从政府里赶出去。这种骗局和对无辜人民的残暴行为不能让它重演。
    加纳报纸24日以显著地位刊载了英国政府的调查委员会报告，并且发表了社论。
      “加纳时报”发表的社论说，“帝国主义奸诈的谎言已经被揭穿了。如果尼亚萨兰有什么阴谋的话，那就是对非洲人国民大会领袖和这个党的追随者进行的骇人听闻的阴谋。”这家报纸接着说，“整个麦克米伦政府在世界舆论的法庭面前遭到了谴责”。
    “新闻晚报”发表的社论说，“整个不人道的和假慈悲的老朽制度已经彻底垮台，夸夸其谈的英国殖民地大臣必须收拾他的摊子作为立即收拾英帝国主义在非洲的腐烂的残体的前奏”。
    这家报纸要求说，“必须立即把权力移交给人民的政府。应该释放班达博士（尼亚萨兰非洲人国民大会主席）和其它非洲爱国者，并且向他们道歉和给予赔偿”。“不能再为韦伦斯基（中非联邦总理）或者阿米塔季（尼亚萨兰总督）再继续执政一天而辩护了”。
