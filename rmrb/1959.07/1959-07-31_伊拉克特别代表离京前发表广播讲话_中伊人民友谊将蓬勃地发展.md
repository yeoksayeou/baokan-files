Xinhua News Agency, July 30th: Before leaving Beijing to return to his country, the Special Representative of the Republic of Iraq, Aziz Sharif, gave a speech to Chinese listeners at the invitation of the Central People's Broadcasting Station. The Central People's Broadcasting Station broadcast his speech manuscript today.

In his speech, Aziz Sharif first expressed his deep gratitude to the Chinese people and Chinese leaders for their care and hospitality towards him.

He said, "I would like to thank you for your correct assessment and firm support of our country's revolution, which was launched on the morning of July 14, 1958. Your support, together with the support of other peace-loving people, played a decisive role in preventing the aggressive and war-mongering forces from carrying out aggressive adventures against our newborn republic. After our republic was born in adversity, surrounded by enemies, you immediately expressed selfless and profound friendship to us."

In his speech, Aziz Sharif pointed out that the people of China and Iraq suffered from imperialist oppression for a long time in the past and have common painful memories. Now, the people of the two countries are still facing common aggressive forces, and the people of the two countries are fighting to defend freedom and peace. Therefore, it is natural for the friendship between the two peoples to flourish. He said, "The great concern shown by the Chinese people and Chinese leaders for the first anniversary of the birth of our republic is a reflection of this solid friendship, a high expression and guarantee of this friendship."

Aziz Sharif said at the end of his speech, "I am convinced that the people of our two countries, by defending peace and developing cooperation between our two countries, can make a great contribution to consolidating the pillars of peace and promoting human civilization."

    新华社30日讯　伊拉克共和国特别代表阿齐兹·谢里夫离开北京回国前，应中央人民广播电台邀请向中国听众发表了讲话。中央人民广播电台今天播送了他的讲话稿。
    阿齐兹·谢里夫在讲话中首先对中国人民和中国领导人对他的照顾和好客精神表示深深的感谢。
    他说：“我谨对你们给予我国从1958年7月14日早晨发动的革命的正确估价和坚决支持表示感谢。你们的支持，连同其他爱好和平人民的支持，在制止侵略与战争势力对我们新生的共和国进行侵略冒险方面，起了决定性的作用。我们的共和国在敌人的包围中、在艰难中诞生以后，你们随即向我们表示了无私的、深厚的友谊。”
    阿齐兹·谢里夫在讲话中指出，中国和伊拉克两国人民过去是长期遭受着帝国主义压迫，都有着共同的痛苦的回忆。现在，两国人民还面临着共同的侵略势力，两国人民现在正为保卫自由与和平而战，因此两国人民的友谊能够蓬勃地发展是很自然的事。他说：“中国人民和中国领导人对我们共和国诞生一周年表示的极大关怀，就是这种巩固的友谊的反映，是这种友谊的高度表现和保证。”
    阿齐兹·谢里夫在讲话结束时说：“我确信：我们两国人民，通过保卫和平和发展我们两国的合作，能够为巩固和平支柱和促进人类文明作出巨大的贡献。”
