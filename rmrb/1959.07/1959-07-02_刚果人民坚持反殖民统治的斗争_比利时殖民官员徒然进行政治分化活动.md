    The Congolese People Persist in the Struggle Against Colonial Rule
    Belgian Colonial Officials Vainly Engage in Political Division Activities
    This newspaper reports: Since the outbreak of large-scale anti-colonial rule struggles in the Congo in January this year, despite the Belgian colonial authorities' frantic bloody suppression and political division activities, the Congolese people's struggle has recently made progress.
    In early June, Belgian Colonial Minister Van Hemelrijck went to the Congo for an "inspection." Wherever he went, he was met with demonstrations and protests from the Congolese people. On the 7th, when Van Hemelrijck arrived in Thysville, in southwestern Congo, more than 3,000 Congolese people shouted slogans demanding that the Congo "achieve immediate and unconditional independence." News reports that before he set off for Thysville, he was surrounded in the Inhiksi area by Congolese people holding signs demanding independence, making it impossible for his car to move. On the evening of the 8th, Van Hemelrijck's arrival in Boma immediately caused a "state of boiling" among the Congolese people. Congolese people in cities such as Bukavu also held demonstrations. In Léopoldville, the capital of the Belgian Congo, on June 24, the Congolese people held a demonstration in front of the colonial government building. Demonstrators held signs that read "Down with colonialism," "Down with the Belgian-Congolese Community," "Immediate independence," and "End the colonial system in the Congo by the end of 1959." The demonstrators even broke into the colonial government building.
    Van Hemelrijck had also visited the Congo twice in January and March for "inspections," doing his best to carry out deceptive propaganda. In April, Van Hemelrijck also put forward so-called "preliminary measures to be taken within the scope of establishing a new system in the Congo," claiming to "expand the functions and powers of mayors, conduct provincial elections at the end of the year; develop news organizations and end racial discrimination." However, the Congolese people responded very coldly to these promises aimed at glossing over colonial rule. At the initiative of the Congolese Alliance and the Congolese National Movement Party in Elisabethville, Congolese parties held a three-day meeting in Luluabourg on April 10. Many parties participating in the meeting powerfully exposed the Belgian colonial authorities' false promises and clearly put forward the demand to establish an independent Congolese government in January 1961.
    Before his most recent visit to the Congo, Van Hemelrijck also tried to provoke disunity among the various Congolese African political parties, but failed to achieve the desired results. On June 24, ten Congolese African political parties in Léopoldville presented a memorandum to Van Hemelrijck and Belgian Congo Governor General Cornelis demanding the independence of the Congo. The memorandum called for the immediate granting of public freedoms and individual rights to the Congo; the establishment of provincial election supervision committees composed of representatives of various parties based on the principle of equality. The memorandum reiterated the opinions of the parties' meeting held in Luluabourg on April 10, requesting that a constitutional conference and a provisional government be formed in June next year, a constitutional referendum be held on December 1 of the same year, and general elections be held in January 1961, followed by the establishment of an independent Congolese government.
    Van Hemelrijck has rejected the demands put forward in the memorandum at a press conference. He said that the Belgian government would not rashly allow this colony to become independent "prematurely." He also said that it would be impossible to establish a provisional government. He insisted that the existence of Belgian colonialists in the Congo was still necessary and that no "subversive propaganda" could be tolerated.

### 刚果人民坚持反殖民统治的斗争  比利时殖民官员徒然进行政治分化活动

    刚果人民坚持反殖民统治的斗争
    比利时殖民官员徒然进行政治分化活动
    本报讯　自今年1月刚果爆发大规模的反殖民统治斗争以来，尽管比利时殖民当局进行了疯狂的血腥镇压和政治分化活动，刚果人民的斗争最近仍然有了进展。
    6月初，比利时殖民大臣范埃梅里克到刚果“视察”，所过之处，都遭到刚果人民的示威和抗议。7日，当范埃梅里克到达刚果西南部的太斯维尔城时，约三千多刚果人高呼口号，要求刚果“立即和无条件地取得独立”。消息说，在他起程去太斯维尔以前，在茵基西地方也受到拿着要求独立的标语牌的刚果人民的包围，使他的汽车寸步难行。8日晚，范埃梅里克到达波马时，又立即在刚果人民中间引起了“沸腾状态”。布卡武等城市的刚果人也纷纷举行示威。在比属刚果首府利奥波德维尔，6月24日刚果人民在殖民政府大楼前举行了示威。示威者举着
  “打倒殖民主义”、“打倒比利时—刚果共同体”、
  “立即实现独立”和“1959年底结束刚果的殖民制度”等标语牌。示威者并曾经冲入殖民政府的大楼。
    范埃梅里克在1月和3月也曾到刚果作过两次
  “视察”，竭力进行欺骗宣传。4月间范埃梅里克还提出了所谓“在刚果建立新制度的范围内将要采取的初步措施”，扬言要“扩大市长职能和权力，在年底进行省选举；发展新闻机构和结束种族歧视”。但是，刚果人民对这些旨在粉饰殖民统治的诺言，反映十分冷淡。在伊利沙伯维尔刚果联盟和刚果民族运动党的倡议下，刚果各政党4月10日在路路阿堡城举行了为期三天的会议。参加这次会议的许多政党有力地揭穿了比利时殖民当局的虚伪诺言，并且明确提出了在1961年1月成立独立的刚果政府的要求。
    范埃梅里克最近一次去刚果之前，又力图挑拨刚果各非洲人政党之间的团结，但是并未能收到预期的效果。6月24日，十个刚果非洲人政党在利奥波德维尔向范埃梅里克和比属刚果总督科内利斯提出了一份要求刚果独立的备忘录。备忘录要求立即给予刚果公共自由和个人权利；建立各省选举监督委员会，根据平等原则由各党的代表组成。备忘录重申了4月10日在路路阿堡举行的各政党会议的意见，要求在明年6月组成制宪会议和临时政府，同年12月1日举行宪法公民投票，1961年1月举行普选，然后成立独立的刚果政府。
    范埃梅里克在记者招待会上已拒绝了备忘录提出的要求。他说，比利时政府不会草率地让这个殖民地“过早”独立。他还说，想要建立一个临时政府是不可能的。他硬说，比利时殖民主义者在刚果存在仍然是必要的，不能容忍任何“颠覆性的宣传”。
