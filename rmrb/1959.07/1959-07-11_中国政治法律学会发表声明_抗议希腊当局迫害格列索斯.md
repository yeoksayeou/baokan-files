China Political Science and Law Association Issues Statement
Protesting Persecution of Glezos by Greek Authorities

    (Our dispatch) The China Political Science and Law Association issued a statement on July 10, protesting the Greek authorities' persecution of Manolis Glezos. The full text of the statement is as follows:

    Ignoring the strong protests of world public opinion, the Greek authorities brazenly decided to open a trial at the Athens Military Tribunal on July 9 against the falsely accused Greek national hero and peace fighter, Manolis Glezos, and other patriots. This tyrannical act of trampling on human rights and violating justice has aroused great indignation among all legal workers in the People's Republic of China.

    As the world knows, Manolis Glezos is an outstanding Greek patriot. During the period of Hitler's occupation of Greece, his fearless spirit in resisting fascist aggression and safeguarding national independence was warmly loved by the Greek people and the people of the world. All of Glezos's activities were aimed at defending the independence and democracy of his motherland and safeguarding the freedom and happiness of the people, which clearly proves that he is a heroic patriot and a staunch peace fighter, and has made outstanding contributions to the cause of peace, democracy, and progress of mankind. The Greek authorities have actually arrested and tried this world-renowned patriotic hero on the so-called "crime" of "espionage." The Greek authorities' arrest and trial of Glezos is based on no factual basis, but is entirely a fabricated charge and a frame-up. This slanderous act by the Greek authorities has been unanimously condemned by righteous people in Greece.

    Now the Greek authorities are invoking the so-called Law No. 375 to bring Glezos and other patriots to trial before a military tribunal. But Law No. 375 has long been rejected by the Greek people. The Greek authorities' willingness to invoke this reactionary law to further persecute Glezos and other patriots clearly exposes the Greek authorities' conspiracy to deliberately frame patriotic people and attack the Greek peace and democratic forces. It is significant to point out the following fact: In the case of the trial of Glezos at the Athens Military Tribunal, three of the four witnesses, who are in key positions, are official police officers. It is obvious that such a trial will not be fair, and the dignity of the law is abandoned without remainder. It is clear that the Greek authorities' unreasonable and illegal persecution of Glezos is directed at the entire Greek patriotic and democratic forces, attempting to use terroristic repression at home to suppress the Greek people's struggle against the Greek authorities' further reliance on the United States and the North Atlantic Group, and the establishment of American rocket bases in Greece, in order to clear the way for the further implementation of the US imperialist policy of war and aggression. This is a violation of the fundamental interests of the Greek people and a blatant attack on the cause of world peace and democracy. Therefore, the Greek people and the people of the world must do everything possible to resolutely stop the Greek authorities' arbitrary and brutal acts of openly trampling on basic human rights, violating human justice, and arbitrarily persecuting Greek patriotic and democratic people.

    In order to defend human rights, uphold justice, safeguard the dignity of the law, and consolidate world peace, all legal workers of the People's Republic of China lodge a serious protest against the Greek authorities' atrocities in persecuting Manolis Glezos, and demand that the military tribunal immediately stop the trial of Greek patriots, and release Glezos and other innocent defendants who have been persecuted. The China Political Science and Law Association calls on legal workers around the world to fulfill our legal workers' duty to serve peace and justice, and to adopt all possible means to provide firm and effective support to Glezos and other persecuted patriots, the innocent defendants in Greece. Let no innocent person suffer illegal persecution! (Attached image)

### 中国政治法律学会发表声明  抗议希腊当局迫害格列索斯

    中国政治法律学会发表声明
    抗议希腊当局迫害格列索斯
    本报讯：中国政治法律学会10日发表声明，抗议希腊当局迫害曼诺里斯·格列索斯，声明全文如下：
    希腊当局不顾世界公众的强烈抗议，悍然决定于7月9日在雅典军事法庭开庭审判被诬告的希腊民族英雄、和平战士曼诺里斯·格列索斯及其他爱国者。这种蹂躏人权、违反正义的专横行为，使中华人民共和国全体法律工作者感到极大的愤慨。
    举世周知：曼诺里斯·格列索斯是希腊杰出的爱国者。在希特勒侵占希腊的时期，他反抗法西斯侵略、维护民族独立的大无畏的精神，受到希腊人民和全世界人民的热烈爱戴。格列索斯的全部活动是为了保卫祖国的独立、民主和维护人民的自由、幸福，十分清楚地证明了：他是一个英勇的爱国者和坚强的和平战士，对人类的和平、民主、进步事业有卓越的贡献。希腊当局竟然以所谓“间谍活动”的“罪名”，对这个全世界钦敬的爱国志士加以逮捕和审判。希腊当局逮捕和审判格列索斯是没有任何事实根据的，而完全是捏造罪名，进行陷害。希腊当局的这种诬告行为已遭到希腊正义人士的一致谴责。
    现在希腊当局又援引所谓第三百七十五号法律，将格列索斯等爱国者交付军事法庭进行审判。但第三百七十五号法律早已遭到希腊人民的唾弃。希腊当局不惜援引这个反动法律来进一步迫害格列索斯等爱国者，明显地暴露了希腊当局蓄意陷害爱国志士，向希腊和平民主力量进攻的阴谋。指出以下事实是有意义的。在雅典军事法庭审判格列索斯的案件中，四个证人里，处于主要地位的三个证人就是官方的警察，很显然，这样的审判是不会公正的，法律的尊严被遗弃无余。很明显，希腊当局对格列索斯进行无理的、非法的迫害的锋芒是指向着希腊整个爱国民主力量的，企图用对国内施行恐怖的镇压，来抑制希腊人民反对希腊当局进一步投靠美国和北大西洋集团，以及在希腊建立美国火箭基地的斗争，而为进一步执行美帝国主义的战争侵略政策扫清道路。这是违反希腊人民的根本利益的，也是向世界和平民主事业的猖狂进攻。因此希腊和全世界人民必须尽一切力量来坚决制止希腊当局公然践踏基本人权，违反人类正义，任意迫害希腊爱国民主志士的专横残暴行为。
    为了保卫人权，申张正义，维护法律尊严，巩固世界和平。中华人民共和国全体法律工作者对希腊当局迫害曼诺里斯·格列索斯的暴行，提出严重的抗议，要求立即停止军事法庭对希腊爱国者的审讯，释放格列索斯及其他遭受迫害无辜被告者。中国政治法律学会并向全世界法律工作者呼吁，尽我们法律工作者为和平与正义服务的职责，采用一切可能的方式，对希腊的无辜的被告——格列索斯和其他遭受迫害的爱国者，进行坚决的、一切有效的支援。不使无罪者受非法的迫害！（附图片）
