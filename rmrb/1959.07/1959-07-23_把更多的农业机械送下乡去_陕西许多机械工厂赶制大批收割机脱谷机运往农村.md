Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an. The industrial departments of Shaanxi Province are vigorously supporting agricultural production.

In addition to the agricultural machinery factories and pesticide factories in the province making every effort to produce agricultural machinery and pesticides, many state-owned and locally state-owned machinery factories are also taking support for agricultural production as one of their important tasks. The Xi'an Agricultural Machinery Factory and other units have rushed to produce 602 rocker-arm harvesters, more than 300 small harvesters, and more than 30 large threshers for use in the summer harvest in rural areas. Many handicraft iron factories have also rushed to produce more than 1.5 million sickles. To support rural areas in fighting drought and preventing and controlling pests and diseases, dozens of machinery factories across the province have rushed to produce more than 200 water pumps and a large number of locomobiles, electric motors, and diesel engines. The Xi'an Pesticide Factory has already processed 7,980 tons of 666 powder, DDT, Ceresan, and other pesticides. At present, various machinery factories are continuing to rush to produce irrigation and drainage equipment and sprayers for spraying pesticides.

In order to facilitate the repair of agricultural machinery and equipment, many machinery factories have also processed a large number of parts. A large number of technicians have gone to the countryside to help people's communes repair agricultural machinery. During the wheat harvest, units such as the Xi'an Power Machinery Factory, the Xi'an Auto Parts Factory, and the Pioneer Auto Repair Factory sent technicians to the Zhangbagou and other people's communes in the suburbs of Xi'an to rush to repair agricultural machinery overnight, ensuring the normal use of all machinery in the communes.

    把更多的农业机械送下乡去
    陕西许多机械工厂赶制大批收割机脱谷机运往农村
    据新华社西安讯　陕西省工业部门大力支援农业生产。
    全省除农业机械厂和农药厂全力生产农业机械和农药以外，很多国营、地方国营机械厂也把支援农业生产作为自己的重要任务之一。西安农业机械厂等单位赶制了六百零二台摇臂式收割机、三百多台小型收割机和三十多台大型脱谷机供给农村夏收使用。许多手工业铁工厂也赶制了一百五十多万把镰刀。为了支援农村抗旱和防治病虫害，全省几十个机械厂已经赶制出二百多台水泵和大批的锅驼机、电动机、柴油机。西安农药厂已经加工了七千九百八十吨六六六粉、滴滴涕、赛力散等农药。目前，各机械厂还在继续赶制排灌设备和喷射农药的喷雾器等。
    为了便于农业机具和药械的修理，许多机械厂还加工了大量的零件。大批技术工人下乡帮助人民公社修理农业机具。西安动力机械厂、西安汽车配件厂、先锋汽车修配厂等单位，麦收时都派技术工人到西安郊区丈八沟等人民公社，连夜赶修农业机具，保证了公社所有机具正常使用。
