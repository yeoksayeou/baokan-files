Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 14th: The "passengers" of the single-stage high-altitude ballistic rocket launched by the Soviet Union on July 10th—the dogs "Brave" and "Pearl"—returned to Earth in very good condition, proving that the flight had no adverse effects on them.

Today, Moscow newspapers published photos of the dogs "Brave" and "Pearl," as well as "Pearl's" three puppies.

"Pravda" today explained the purpose of the experiment (on the 10th), stating that the purpose of the biological experiment was still the same as before: to study the state of biological tissues during acceleration during rocket flight, the transition from acceleration to weightlessness, and under conditions of weightlessness.

The two dogs flew very well. As soon as they landed, they ran around, and seemed to be in very good health. "Brave" has already flown four times, and ascended to the upper atmosphere twice in a row, proving that animals can ascend to high altitudes more than once. The other dog, "Pearl," gave birth to three puppies about a month before this flight, and this flight also proved that it did not have any impact on its bodily tissues.

    遨游太空无倦色
    两狗着陆就奔跑
    新华社莫斯科14日电　苏联7月10日所发射的单级高空弹道火箭的“乘客”——小狗“勇士”和“珍珠”返回地面后情况非常良好，证明这次飞行对它们并无影响。
    今天莫斯科的报纸上刊登了小狗“勇士”和“珍珠”以及“珍珠”所生的三只小狗的照片。
    “真理报”在今天介绍这次（10日）实验目的时说，这次所作的生物实验的目的仍然和以前一样，是为了研究在火箭飞行时的加速度中，以及由加速度过渡到失重和在失重情况下生物机体组织的状态。
    这两只小狗的飞行情况非常良好，当它们刚一着陆就奔跑起来，看来，都非常健壮。“勇士”已经是第四次飞行，而且是接连两次升入大气高层，这证明动物可以不止一次地升入高空。另一只小狗“珍珠”在这次飞行前，大约一个月时才生下了三只小狗，而这次飞行也证明了对它的身体组织并没有产生任何影响。
