Understanding the Objective Nature of Economic Laws
Xu Dixing

I

Why should we study political economy? To answer this question, many reasons can be given, and recognizing the objective nature of economic laws is a very important aspect.

Economic laws are premised on certain economic conditions, and they are an objective process of economic development that does not shift with people's will. Under private ownership, especially under the capitalist system, economic laws exert a compulsory effect on people. Take commodity production as an example. In a commodity economy based on private ownership, commodity production is carried out by scattered, individual private producers. They compete with each other, always wanting to exclude others, and maintain and expand their position in the market. However, none of them know how people demand the commodities they produce, whether they can sell these commodities in the market, and whether the labor they consume can be compensated. Only after arriving at the market can the situation be clarified. In the market, the law of value manifests itself through the relationship between supply and demand as constantly fluctuating prices, informing producers which products are overproduced and which are underproduced. This spontaneous fluctuation of prices around value forces commodity producers to reduce or expand the production of certain commodities, forcing them to withdraw from sectors where commodity prices are lower than value and flock to sectors where they can profit more at the time. From this, it can be seen that in a commodity economy based on private ownership, commodity producers are controlled by the market. The law of value exerts a compulsory effect on people, spontaneously playing the role of regulating the distribution of social labor and means of production among various sectors of the commodity economy. Engels said: "Commodity production, like any other form of production, has its own special, inherent laws that cannot be separated from it. These laws, regardless of the anarchy, still show their effect in and through the anarchy. These laws are expressed in the only form of social connection that remains (i.e., exchange) and act as compulsory laws of competition on individual producers. Therefore, in the beginning, these producers themselves do not even know these laws, and only gradually discover them through long-term experience. Consequently, these laws are established over the producers and against the will of the producers, becoming the blindly functioning natural laws of their form of production. Production dominates the producers." (Engels: "Anti-Dühring," People's Publishing House, 1956 edition, pp. 284-285). Under the conditions of capitalist society, the laws of commodity production play an even more prominent and powerful role. Capitalist production is expanded commodity reproduction, and this production is based on the capitalist ownership of the means of production and the capitalist exploitation of the surplus value of the working masses. The contradiction between the social nature of production and the capitalist form of appropriation of production results is manifested in the increasing class antagonism between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and in the intensification of the anarchy of capitalist production. "The driving force of social production anarchy transforms the possibility of endlessly improving the machines used by large industry into a law that every industrial capitalist must obey, a law that forces him to constantly improve his machines under the threat of destruction." ("Anti-Dühring" pp. 286-287). The improvement of machines throws a certain number of people onto the streets, creating an "industrial reserve army" and resulting in a relative surplus of population; it reduces the consumption of the working people to the lowest level, causing the expansion of the capitalist market to lag behind its expansion in production. The contradiction between the purpose of capitalist production—to obtain profits on an increasingly large scale—and the means to achieve this purpose—expanded commodity reproduction—periodically turns into economic crises of overproduction. The crisis, like a great storm, violently destroys capitalist commodity production and circulation, not only causing a large number of workers to lose their jobs, but also bankrupting many large capitalists and more small capitalists. From this, it can be seen that in capitalist society, both laborers and owners of the means of production "lose the power to control their own social relations." Laborers are certainly dominated by the means of production; even capitalists who occupy the means of production and exploit producers cannot truly control their own destiny.

With the elimination of capitalist economy and the socialization of the means of production, people are freed from the oppression of social economic relations and gain freedom, gain the power to control their own means of production and products, become "masters" of social life, and social production eliminates the rule of anarchy and is carried out under the unified plan of the socialist state. In this way, the situation where "means of production dominate the producers" is declared over. Engels said: "When society takes possession of all means of production and uses them according to social planning, society eliminates the enslavement of man by the means of production, which has been dominant until now." ("Anti-Dühring," p. 310). Under these circumstances, objective laws originally generated on the basis of capitalist economy, such as the law of surplus value, the law of competition and production anarchy, the law of average profit, and the laws of capitalist accumulation, all lose their conditions for existence and withdraw from the historical stage, losing their effectiveness.

In our country, due to the continuous development of the socialist state-owned economy and the victory of the socialist revolution on the economic front, the individual economy has realized cooperativization, and capitalist enterprises, in the form of overall public-private partnership and fixed interest, have basically become enterprises of a socialist nature. In this way, on a national scale, we have basically achieved the socialist socialization of the means of production. Under these circumstances, the socialist economic laws are increasingly playing their huge role in the entire national economic life of our country.

Under the socialist system, people become the masters of the means of production and products. However, this situation does not negate the objective nature of economic laws in socialist society, and it cannot be considered that people can arbitrarily act according to their own subjective will in economic life without regard to objective economic laws. Economic laws under the socialist system are based on socialist relations of production. The socialist public ownership of the means of production determines the purpose of production under the socialist system and the means to achieve it, which gives rise to the basic economic law of socialism. At the same time, due to the socialization of the means of production, it becomes possible and necessary to carry out social production according to a pre-determined plan, because without a general plan that unifies the actions of the whole society and guarantees the necessary proportions of the various departments and enterprises in the development of the entire national economy, the socialized socialist large-scale production cannot be carried out; thus, the law of planned and proportional development of the national economy arises. Other socialist economic laws are also conditional on the level reached by socialist relations of production and socialist social productive forces. Due to different economic conditions and different relations of production, the economic laws of socialist society are essentially different from the economic laws of private ownership societies and capitalist societies. However, whether economic laws of private ownership societies or socialist societies, they objectively exist, and they are the objective inevitability of the economic life process that does not shift with people's will. Stalin said: "Under the socialist system, the laws of political economy are objective laws that reflect the regularity of the economic life process that does not shift with our will." (Stalin: "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," People's Publishing House, 1952 edition, pp. 7-8). Therefore, we cannot ignore the objective inevitability of economic laws in socialist society and isolate and emphasize people's free will.

II

Facts prove that in socialist society, economic laws objectively exist. Now, the law of value, the law of planned and proportional development of the national economy, and the law of distribution according to labor are taken as examples to prove this assertion.

(1) In socialist society, there must be commodities and commodity production, and therefore there must be the law of value. Between the system of ownership by the whole people and the system of collective ownership, and between the various units of collective ownership, there exists an economic connection of mutual assistance and cooperation. State-owned enterprises under the system of ownership by the whole people need to obtain grain and cash crops, etc., from the system of collective ownership (agricultural production cooperatives or the current people's communes); and agricultural production cooperatives or people's communes under the system of collective ownership need to obtain agricultural machinery, fertilizers, fuels, and daily-use industrial products, etc., from state-owned enterprises. To realize this economic connection, at the present stage, it can only be carried out through commodity exchange relations, and cannot be directly allocated by the state. In socialist society, the means of production and products of enterprises under the system of collective ownership belong to it, and if the state now adopts the method of uncompensated direct allocation of products from the people's communes or cooperatives, in essence, it is equivalent to negating the collective ownership of the means of production of the people's communes or cooperatives. Within the people's commune, uncompensated direct allocation is also not possible between the various accounting units.

When realizing commodity relations, it is necessary to implement the principle of equivalent exchange, because only in this way can the due interests of both parties in the exchange be guaranteed, and can the production enthusiasm of the working people under the system of collective ownership be effectively encouraged. Experience has proven that a correct price policy is one of the guarantees for achieving production plans and completing procurement tasks in agriculture. Since liberation, especially since agricultural cooperativization, the state has made great achievements in promoting farmers to expand the planting of cotton, oilseeds, and other cash crops and complete procurement plans. One of the experiences is to use the law of value to make farmers feel that increasing the production of these things is beneficial to them. Conversely, if the state violates the principle of equivalent exchange when stipulating the procurement prices of agricultural products, it will either cause unnecessary losses to the state, or reduce the income of the production cooperatives or people's communes, affecting the accumulation of the cooperatives or people's communes and the personal income of the members, which will also hinder the improvement of the production enthusiasm of the members. Between the various units of the system of collective ownership, if the principle of equivalent exchange is not observed, it will cause one party involved in the economic connection to suffer losses and the other party to take advantage, which will hinder mutual assistance and cooperation between each other. From this, it can be seen that equivalent exchange is an objective inevitability of commodity relations. To realize economic mutual assistance and cooperation between the system of ownership by the whole people and the system of collective ownership, and between the various units of collective ownership through commodity relations, it is necessary to fully consider the requirements of the law of value and strictly abide by the principle of equivalent exchange.

Within the system of ownership by the whole people, in addition to the production of consumer goods being commodity production, the exchange of products between state-owned enterprises is also carried out in the form of commodities. The law of value also plays its due role in these areas.

(2) Public ownership of the means of production eliminates competition and anarchy of production under the capitalist system, making the various sectors of the entire national economy a unified whole that coordinates with each other. This makes it possible for the entire society to carry out production according to a pre-determined unified plan; and only according to a unified plan, ensuring that social labor and means of production are reasonably and economically used between the various sectors of the national economy, can socialist large-scale production develop smoothly and at high speed. The law of planned and proportional development of the national economy is based on public ownership of the means of production and this objective requirement. Stalin said: "The law of planned development of the national economy arises as the opposite of the law of competition and anarchy of production under the capitalist system. It arises on the basis of the public ownership of the means of production after the law of competition and anarchy of production loses its effect. It works because socialist national economy can only be carried out on the basis of the economic law of planned development of the national economy." (Stalin: "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," p. 6). The state's economic plan must be based on this economic law and must reflect the requirements of this economic law in order to correctly lead the development of the entire national economy.

There objectively exists a certain proportional relationship between the various sectors of the national economy. The law of planned development of the national economy requires that the development of all economic sectors must obey the leadership of the state's unified plan and abide by the objectively existing proportional relationship between the various sectors and various components of the national economy. Whether in the production of means of production and the production of consumer goods, between industry and agriculture, between heavy industry and light industry, between the various sectors of industry, between the various sectors of agriculture, etc., in the distribution of labor and means of production, arrangements must be made according to a certain proportional relationship. Among the various sectors of the national economy, it is necessary to distinguish between primary and secondary, important and unimportant, according to the specific circumstances, so that the development of the national economy meets the requirements of the law of planned and proportional development. It is not in line with the law of planned and proportional development of the national economy to demand average development of all sectors regardless of primary and secondary, important and unimportant, or to only grasp the key points while losing sight of the general.

The various sectors of the national economy are interconnected and must be coordinated with each other. If the production of major sectors and major industries occupies too much in the allocation of means of production and labor, it will affect the production of other related sectors; and if the production of these related sectors is reduced too much, it will in turn affect the production of major sectors and major industries, causing the production of major sectors and major industries to be restricted and unable to move forward. Take steel as an example. The production of this industry directly and indirectly requires the support of industries such as coal, machinery manufacturing, electricity, forest logging, basic chemicals, and transportation. To increase the production of one ton of steel and iron, it is necessary to correspondingly increase the production and supply of coal, smelting equipment, electricity, wood, basic chemicals, etc.; it is necessary to correspondingly increase a certain volume of freight transportation. Among these related industries, steel production will be limited if any one of them is lacking. At the same time, to increase the labor force in steel production, it is necessary to correspondingly increase the grain, non-staple food, and daily-use light industrial products, etc., required by the workers in this field. This situation shows that key sectors and other sectors must "take into account overall planning and make overall arrangements"; it shows that a proportional relationship adapted to the level of productive forces at that time, the supply capacity of means of production and consumer goods at that time, and the technical capabilities at that time must be maintained between key sectors and other sectors.

If any industry, even an industry that seems unimportant, does not receive due attention, it will also affect the production of other industries. For example, rosin, on the surface, seems unremarkable, but if it is lacking, the production of many industries will be affected. Manufacturing one ton of paper requires ten to fifteen kilograms of rosin, ten thousand boxes of matches require one thousand two hundred kilograms of rosin, and one ton of soap requires more than one hundred kilograms of rosin. The manufacturing of paint, pesticides, etc., also requires a lot of rosin. A pound less of rosin means that the factories manufacturing paper, matches, and soap lack a pound of ingredients. Facts tell us that the national economy is a complex unity. Although there are key and non-key sectors, major and minor industries, and large and small-scale production among the various sectors and industries, after all, non-key sectors, minor industries, and small-scale production are all components of the national economy and are indispensable aspects of economic construction and people's lives. It is contrary to the objectively existing law of planned and proportional development of the national economy to regard non-key sectors, minor industries, and small-scale production as insignificant and dispensable things.

(3) Under socialist conditions, the level of development of productive forces has not yet reached the degree that can provide abundant products to implement distribution according to need; before production has been fully mechanized and automated, working hours are still relatively long, labor intensity is still relatively high, and labor has not yet fully become a need in people's lives; it is not yet possible for the entire people to universally enjoy higher education, and there is still a significant difference between skilled labor and simple labor; people's ideological awareness cannot completely get rid of the influence of the remnants of the old society, and some are sincere and earnest in their attitude towards labor, while others are perfunctory - these situations make it impossible for society to adopt the principle of distribution according to need when distributing the vast majority of consumer goods among the working people, and can only adopt the principle of distribution according to labor. Distribution according to labor is an objective economic law in terms of distribution relations under socialist conditions. Obeying this law to deal with distribution issues can encourage the working people to work conscientiously, strive to learn technology, and continuously improve labor productivity; it can promote the working people to materially care about the results of their labor and link personal interests with the interests of the collective and the state. It is an unrealizable fantasy to attempt to prematurely abandon the principle of distribution according to labor and adopt the principle of distribution according to need to deal with the distribution of consumer goods among the working people when conditions are not yet ripe. It is not communist distribution according to need, but only petty-bourgeois egalitarianism, to demand the same labor remuneration regardless of the quantity and quality of labor. This kind of egalitarianism has nothing in common with Marxism. The equality under socialist conditions as understood by Marxism is that everyone is equally free from private ownership and exploitation of the means of production, everyone equally uses the public means of production for production and work, everyone equally has the obligation to engage in labor, and everyone's labor is paid according to the quantity and quality of labor they put in in their work. The "Resolution on Several Questions Concerning People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party pointed out: "The socialist principle is 'from each according to his ability, to each according to his labor'; the communist principle is 'from each according to his ability, to each according to need'. The communist distribution system is more reasonable, but this can only be realized after social products are extremely abundant. Negating the principle of distribution according to labor without this condition will hinder people's enthusiasm for labor, which is not conducive to the development of production, not conducive to the increase of social products, and not conducive to promoting the realization of communism."

III

Since economic laws have objective inevitability, are people completely powerless in front of them? Can they only become their slaves? That is not the case. Facts prove that people are not powerless in the face of economic laws. Under socialist conditions, people not only have the possibility of recognizing objectively existing economic laws, but also have the possibility of consciously using them to serve the development of the socialist economy. Engels had already said: "The laws of people's own social action - which until now have stood in opposition to people as alien, dominating natural laws - will be applied by people very expertly, and will therefore also be subject to people's control. People's social existence, which until now has stood in opposition to people as things imposed on them by nature and history, has now become their own free action. The objective alien forces that have ruled over history until now are now under the control of people themselves." ("Anti-Dühring," pp. 298-299). In this passage, Engels on the one hand points out the objective inevitability of economic laws; on the other hand, he points out that objective laws can be recognized and can be used. The so-called "subject to people's control," the so-called "became their own free action," the so-called "under the control of people," are nothing more than saying that under socialist conditions, people have the possibility of recognizing objective economic laws and consciously using them to serve the socialist cause. The practice of socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country fully proves this point. Under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people consciously used the law that the relations of production must be adapted to the nature of the productive forces to realize the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce; consciously used the basic economic law of socialism, the law of planned and proportional development of the national economy, and the law of value, etc., to carry out the socialist industrialization of the country, strengthen the economic ties between industry and agriculture, cities and villages, and develop the entire socialist national economy; consciously used the law of distribution according to labor and carried out political and ideological education to deal with the distribution issues among the working people and to promote the working people to actively improve labor productivity.

Affirming the objective inevitability of economic laws does not negate people's free will, nor does it negate people's subjective initiative. However, people's free will and subjective initiative must be premised on recognizing objective inevitability. That is to say, only on the basis of recognizing objective inevitability can people act freely. Engels called people's freedom "recognized necessity." Lenin said: "Engels, on the one hand, examines human knowledge and will, and on the other hand, he also examines the necessity of nature; he did not propose any definition, but only said that the necessity of nature is primary, and human will and consciousness are secondary. The latter inevitably and necessarily adapts to the former." (Lenin: "Materialism and Empirio-criticism," "Lenin's Collected Works," Vol. 14, p. 193). The situation is the same in the social and economic field. Objectively existing economic laws are primary; and people's will and subjective initiative are secondary. When people recognize the objective nature of economic laws and decide policies and deal with problems according to their inevitability, the socialist cause will develop extremely smoothly. Conversely, when people do not recognize the objective inevitability of economic laws and violate this inevitability in dealing with problems, they will come out to express "protest" and spontaneously exert a compulsory effect. Engels had already said: "Social forces, like natural forces, exert a blind, compulsory, and destructive effect before we recognize and calculate them. But once we recognize it, study its effect, direction, and influence, then it is entirely up to us to make it more subject to our will and use it to achieve our goals." ("Anti-Dühring," p. 293).

After the means of production are socialized, people become the masters of their own social life, which not only makes it possible to recognize objectively existing economic laws, but also makes it possible to consciously use objective economic laws to serve the socialist cause. However, this does not mean that people have already recognized them and are good at using them. To turn this possibility into reality, we still need to make efforts. We must constantly analyze the situation, constantly study problems, and constantly summarize experiences in the practice of economic construction. Recognition begins with practice. It is impossible to recognize objective economic laws without practice. At the same time, we must also engage in theoretical study, that is, through the study of political economy, to improve our theoretical level, better summarize our practical experience, and help us raise perceptual knowledge to the stage of rational knowledge, so as to do our economic work better under the guidance of theory. Only in this way can the practice of our socialist construction conform to objective economic laws, and can we fully exert our subjective initiative in our work.

    认识经济规律的客观性质
    许涤新
    一
    为什么要学习政治经济学？要回答这个问题，可以举出很多的理由，认识经济规律的客观性质，是一个很重要的方面。
    经济规律是以一定的经济条件为前提的，它是不以人们的意志为转移的经济发展的客观过程。在私有制度之下，特别是在资本主义制度之下，经济规律对于人们发生着强制作用。以商品生产来说吧，在以私有制为基础的商品经济中，商品生产是由分散的、单独的私人生产者进行的，他们彼此竞争，总想排斥别人、保持并扩大自己在市场上的阵地。但是，他们中间的每一个人，谁也不知道人们对他所生产的商品的需求怎样，他能否在市场上卖掉这些商品，他所消耗的劳动能否得到补偿。只有到了市场以后，情况才能弄明白。在市场上，价值规律通过供求关系表现为不断波动的价格，使生产者知道：那些产品生产得太多，那些产品生产得太少。价格环绕价值的这种自发性的波动，迫使商品生产者缩减或扩大某种商品的生产，迫使他们退出那些商品价格低于价值的部门，而涌向当时可以获利较多的部门。由此可见：在以私有制为基础的商品经济中，商品生产者是被市场所控制的。价值规律在对人们起着强制作用，在自发地起着调节商品经济各部门间社会劳动和生产资料的分配的作用。恩格斯说道：“商品生产，和任何其他生产形式一样，有它自己特殊的、它所固有的不能与它分离的规律，这些规律，不管无政府状态如何，还是在无政府状态之中并通过无政府状态来显示自己的作用。这些规律表现于社会联系的唯一保留下来的形式之中（即交换之中），并且作为竞争的强制规律，对个别的生产者发生作用。所以，在开始的时候，这些生产者自己甚至并不知道这些规律，只有经过长期的经验，才逐渐地发现它们；因之，这些规律是越过生产者并且违反生产者的意志而确立的，成为他们生产形式的、盲目地起作用的自然规律。生产品统治着生产者。”（恩格斯：“反杜林论”，人民出版社1956年版，第284—285页）在资本主义社会的条件下，商品生产的规律，就更突出地、有力地发生作用了。资本主义的生产是扩大的商品再生产，而这种生产是以资本家的生产资料所有制、是以资本家剥削工人群众的剩余价值为基础的。生产的社会性和生产成果的资本主义占有形式之间的矛盾，表现为无产阶级和资产阶级间阶级对抗的增长，表现为资本主义生产无政府状态的加剧。“社会的生产无政府状态的推动力，把大工业所使用的机器的无止境地改善的可能性，变成为每一个工业资本家的必须遵守的规律，这个规律，使他在遭受毁灭的威胁之下，逼得不断地改进自己的机器。”（“反杜林论”286—287页）而机器的改进，就会使社会上一定数量的人被抛到十字街头，成为“产业后备军”，造成相对的人口过剩；就会使劳动人民的消费降低到最低水平，使资本主义市场的扩展赶不上它的生产上的扩展。资本主义生产的目的——日益大规模地获取利润，同达到这个目的的手段——扩大的商品再生产的矛盾，就周期地变为生产过剩的经济危机了。危机像一阵大风暴，猛烈地破坏了资本主义的商品生产和流通，这不但使大量的工人失了业，而且使许多大资本家和更多的小资本家破了产。由此可见，在资本主义社会里，劳动者和生产资料占有者都“丧失了控制自己本身的社会关系的权力”。劳动者固然被生产资料所支配；就是占有了生产资料并剥削生产者的资本家，也无法真正掌握自己的命运。
    随着资本主义经济的消灭和生产资料的公有化，人们解脱了社会经济关系的压迫而获得了自由，获得了支配自己的生产资料和生产品的权力，成为社会生活的“主人”，社会的生产也就排除了无政府状态的统治，而在社会主义国家的统一计划之下进行。这样，过去那种“生产资料支配着生产者”的局面，就宣告结束了。恩格斯说道：“当社会掌握全部生产资料，使之可以根据社会的计划来运用它们的时候，社会就消灭了直到现在居支配地位的、生产资料对于人的奴役。”（“反杜林论”第310页）在这种情况之下，原来在资本主义经济的基础上产生的客观规律，如剩余价值规律、竞争和生产无政府状态的规律、平均利润规律以及资本主义积累的规律等等，都因为失去存在的条件而退出历史舞台，失掉了效力。
    在我国，由于社会主义国营经济的不断发展，由于经济战线上社会主义革命的胜利，个体经济已经实现了合作化，而资本主义企业，在全行业公私合营和定息的形式下，基本上已经成为社会主义性质的企业。这样，在全国范围来说，我们就在基本上实现了生产资料的社会主义公有化。在这种情况之下，社会主义的经济规律，就在我国整个国民经济生活中，日益发挥其巨大的作用。
    在社会主义制度下，人们成为生产资料和生产品的主人。但是，这种情况并不否定社会主义社会经济规律的客观性质，不能认为，人们在经济生活中可以不顾客观的经济规律而随自己的主观意志任意行动。社会主义制度下的经济规律是以社会主义的生产关系作为基础的。社会主义的生产资料的公有制，决定了社会主义制度下生产的目的及其实现的手段，这就产生了社会主义的基本经济规律。同时，由于生产资料的公有化，按照预定计划进行社会生产，就成为可能，也成为必要，因为如果没有一个使全社会行动统一、保证在整个国民经济发展中各部门和各个企业的必要比例的总计划，公有化的社会主义大生产便不能进行；这样，国民经济有计划按比例发展的规律也就产生了。其他的社会主义的经济规律，也都以社会主义生产关系和社会主义社会生产力所达到的水平作为条件的。由于经济条件不同，由于生产关系不同，社会主义社会的经济规律同私有制社会的经济规律，同资本主义社会的经济规律，在实质上是不相同的。但是，无论私有制社会的经济规律，或者社会主义社会的经济规律，都是客观存在着的，都是不以人们的意志为转移的经济生活过程的客观必然性。斯大林说道：“在社会主义制度下，政治经济学的法则是反映不以我们的意志为转移的经济生活过程的规律性的客观法则。”（斯大林：“苏联社会主义经济问题”，人民出版社1952年版，第7—8页）因此，我们不能忽视社会主义社会的经济规律的客观必然性，而孤立地强调人们的自由意志。
    二
    事实证明：在社会主义社会里，经济规律是客观地存在着的。现在把价值规律、国民经济有计划按比例发展规律和按劳分配规律作为例子，来证明这个论断。
    （一）在社会主义社会中，必然存在着商品和商品生产，也就必然存在着价值规律。在全民所有制和集体所有制之间、在集体所有制各个单位彼此之间，存在一种互助协作的经济联系。全民所有制的国营企业需要从集体所有制（农业生产合作社或现阶段的人民公社）取得粮食和经济作物等等；而集体所有制的农业生产合作社或人民公社，需要从国营企业取得农业机械、肥料、燃料和日用工业品等等。要实现这种经济联系，在现阶段，只能通过商品交换的关系来进行，而不能由国家直接调拨。在社会主义社会里，集体所有制的企业的生产资料和生产品，是属于它自己所有的，国家如果现在对人民公社或合作社的产品，就采取无偿地直接调拨的方式，在实质上，就等于否定了人民公社或合作社的生产资料集体所有制。在人民公社内部，各个核算单位之间，也同样不能无偿地直接调拨。
    在实现商品关系的时候，需要贯彻等价交换的原则，因为只有这样，才能保证交换双方应得的利益，才能有效地鼓励集体所有制的劳动人民的生产积极性。经验证明：正确的价格政策，是农业方面实现生产计划和完成收购任务的保证之一。解放以来，特别是在农业合作化以来，国家对于推动农民扩大种植棉花、油料和其他经济作物和完成收购计划，有了很大的成绩，其中的经验之一，就是利用价值规律，使农民感觉到增产这些东西，对自己有利。反之，如果国家在规定农产品收购价格的时候，违反了等价交换的原则，那就会或者使国家遭受到不必要的损失，或者使生产合作社或人民公社的收入减少，使合作社或人民公社的积累和社员的个人收入受到影响，这样也就会妨碍社员生产积极性的提高。在集体所有制的各个单位之间，如果不遵守等价交换的原则，就会使发生经济联系的双方中，一方吃亏，一方占便宜，这样，就会妨碍彼此间的互助协作。由此可见，等价交换是商品关系的客观必然性。要在全民所有制同集体所有制之间，在集体所有制各单位之间通过商品关系实现经济上的互助协作，就必须充分考虑价值规律的要求，严格遵守等价交换的原则。
    在全民所有制内部，除了消费品生产是商品生产以外，国营企业之间的产品交换，也是通过商品形式来进行的。价值规律在这些领域内，也发生它应有的作用。
      （二）生产资料的公有制，消除了资本主义制度下的竞争和生产的无政府状态，使整个国民经济各部门组成为相互协调的统一体，这样，就使整个社会有可能按照预定的统一计划进行生产；而只有按照统一计划，保证社会劳动和生产资料在国民经济各部门之间得到合理而节约的使用，社会主义的大生产才有可能顺利地、高速度地发展。国民经济有计划按比例发展的规律，就是以生产资料的公有制和这种客观要求作为根据的。斯大林说道：“国民经济有计划发展的法则，是作为资本主义制度下竞争和生产无政府状态的法则的对立物而产生的。它是当竞争和生产无政府状态的法则失去效力以后，在生产资料公有化的基础上产生的。它之所以发生了作用，是因为只有在国民经济有计划发展的经济法则的基础上，社会主义的国民经济才能进行。”（斯大林：“苏联社会主义经济问题”，第6页）国家的经济计划必须以这个经济规律作为依据，必须反映这个经济规律的要求，才能正确地领导整个国民经济的发展。
    国民经济各部门间，客观上存在着一定的比例关系。国民经济有计划发展的规律，要求一切经济部门的发展要服从国家的统一计划的领导，遵守国民经济各部门和各种成分之间客观存在的比例关系。不论在生产资料的生产和消费品的生产之间、在工业和农业之间、在重工业和轻工业之间、在工业的各个部门之间、在农业的各个部门之间，等等，在劳动力和生产资料的分配上，都要按照一定的比例关系进行安排。在国民经济的各个部门之间，需要根据具体情况分别主次和轻重，以便使国民经济的发展符合有计划按比例发展规律的要求。如果不分主次，不分重点非重点，而要求各部门平均发展，或者只抓住重点，而丢掉了一般，都是不符合于国民经济有计划按比例发展规律的。
    国民经济的各个部门是彼此联系的，是必须相互协调的。作为主要部门、主要行业的生产，如果在生产资料和劳动力的分配上，占得太多，就会影响其他有关部门的生产；而这些有关部门的生产，如果减少得太多了，也就会反过来影响主要部门、主要行业的生产，使主要部门、主要行业的生产，受到牵制而不能前进了。以钢铁为例吧，这个行业的生产是直接间接地需要煤炭、机器制造、电力、森林采伐、基本化学和交通运输等行业的支援的。增产一吨钢和铁，就得相应地增加煤炭、冶炼设备、电力、木材、基本化学等方面的生产和供应；就得相应地增加交通运输的一定货运量。在这些有关的行业中，不管缺哪一项，都会使钢铁生产受到限制。同时，要增加钢铁生产方面的劳动力，就得相应地增加这方面职工所需要的粮食、副食品和日用轻工业品等等。这种情况，说明重点部门和其他部门必须“统筹兼顾、全面安排”；说明重点部门和其他部门之间，必须保持着一个适应于当时的生产力水平，当时的生产资料、消费品供应能力和当时的技术能力的比例关系。
    不论哪一个行业，甚至看起来不大重要的行业，如果得不到应有的注意，也会影响其他行业的生产。例如松香，表面上看起来似乎没有什么了不得，但是，如果缺少了它，不少行业的生产就会受到影响。制造一吨纸要用十公斤到十五公斤松香，一万件火柴要用一千二百公斤松香，一吨肥皂要用一百公斤以上的松香。还有制造油漆、杀虫药剂等也都要很多松香。少采一斤松香，则制造纸张、火柴、肥皂的工厂，也就缺少一斤配料。事实告诉我们：国民经济是一个复杂的统一体，在各个部门、各个行业之间，虽有重点非重点之分，主要次要之分，大宗小宗之分，但是，非重点的部门、次要的部门和小宗的生产，毕竟都是国民经济的构成部分，都是经济建设和人民生活中不可缺少的方面。如果把非重点部门、次要部门和小宗生产，看成无足轻重、可有可无的东西，那是同客观存在的国民经济有计划按比例发展的规律相抵触的。
    （三）在社会主义条件下，生产力的发展水平，还未达到能够提供丰富的产品实行按需分配的程度；在生产还没有实现完全机械化和自动化以前，劳动时间还比较长，劳动强度还比较高，劳动还没有完全成为人们生活的需要；全体人民还没有可能普遍享受高等教育，熟练劳动和简单劳动之间还有显著的差别；人们的思想意识还不能完全摆脱旧社会残余的影响，在劳动态度上有的诚诚恳恳、有的敷衍塞责，——这些情况，使社会在劳动人民间分配绝大部分消费品的时候，只能采取按劳分配的原则，而不能采取按需分配的原则。按劳分配是社会主义条件下在分配关系方面的客观经济规律。遵守这个规律去处理分配问题，可以鼓励劳动人民认真劳动，努力学习技术，不断地提高劳动生产率；可以推动劳动人民在物质上关心自己劳动的成果，并把个人利益同集体、同国家的利益联系起来。如果在条件尚未成熟的时候，企图过早地抛弃按劳分配的原则，而采用按需分配的原则去处理劳动人民间消费品的分配，这是不能实现的空想。如果不管劳动的数量和质量，要求平均地一律付给同样的劳动报酬，那并不是共产主义的按需分配，而只不过是小资产阶级的平均主义。这种平均主义同马克思主义是毫无相同之处的。马克思主义所理解的社会主义条件下的平等，是大家都平等地摆脱了生产资料的私有制和剥削，大家都平等地用公有的生产资料进行生产和工作，大家平等地都有从事劳动的义务，对大家的劳动都按照其在工作中所付出的劳动的数量和质量支付报酬。党的八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”指出：“社会主义的原则是‘各尽所能，按劳分配’；共产主义的原则是‘各尽所能，按需分配’。共产主义的分配制度更合理，但是这只有在社会产品极大地丰富了以后才可能实现。没有这个条件而否定按劳分配的原则，就会妨害人们劳动的积极性，就不利于生产的发展，不利于社会产品的增加，也就不利于促进共产主义的实现。”
    三
    经济规律既然具有客观必然性，那末，人们在它的面前，是不是就完全无能为力呢？是不是就只能成为它的奴隶呢？那又不然。事实证明，人们在经济规律面前并不是无能为力的。在社会主义的条件下，人们不但有可能认识客观存在的经济规律，而且有可能自觉地利用它为社会主义经济的发展服务。恩格斯早就说道：“人们自己的社会行动的规律——它直到现在还作为异己的、支配着人们的自然规律而与人们相对立——将被人们十分内行地运用了，因之也将服从于人们的支配了。人们的社会生存，直到现在，作为自然和历史所强加于他们头上的事物，而和人们相对立，现在变成了他们自己的自由行动。直到现在统治于历史之上的客观的异己的力量，现在才受到人们自己的控制。”（“反杜林论”，第298——299页）恩格斯在这一段话中，一方面指出经济规律的客观必然性；另一方面，又指出客观规律是能够被认识，能够被运用的。所谓“服从于人们的支配”，所谓“变成了他们自己的自由行动”，所谓“受到人们的控制”，无非是说，人们在社会主义的条件下，有可能认识客观经济规律并自觉地利用它为社会主义事业服务。我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的实践，完全证明了这一点。中国人民在党和毛泽东同志的领导下，自觉地利用了生产关系一定要适合生产力性质的规律，实现了对农业、手工业和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造；自觉地利用了社会主义基本经济规律、国民经济有计划按比例发展的规律和价值规律等，去进行国家的社会主义工业化，加强工业和农业、城市和乡村的经济联系，发展整个社会主义国民经济；自觉地利用按劳分配规律和进行政治思想教育，去处理劳动人民间的分配问题，去推动劳动人民积极提高劳动生产率。
    肯定经济规律的客观必然性，并不否定人们的自由意志，并不否定人们的主观能动性。但是，人们的自由意志和主观能动性必须以认识客观的必然性为前提。这就是说，只有在认识客观必然性的基础上，人们才能自由活动，恩格斯把人们的自由，叫做“被认识了的必然性”。列宁说：“恩格斯一方面考察人的认识和意志，另一方面也考察自然界的必然性；他没有提出任何定义，只是说，自然界的必然性是第一性的，而人的意志和意识是第二性的。后者不可避免地、必然地要适应前者。”（列宁：“唯物主义与经验批判主义”，“列宁全集”第14卷，第193页）在社会经济领域中，情况也是如此。客观存在的经济规律是第一性的；而人们的意志和主观能动性是第二性的。当人们认识了经济规律的客观性质并根据它们的必然性去决定政策、去处理问题的时候，社会主义事业就得到极其顺利的发展。反之，当人们不认识经济规律的客观必然性而违背这种必然性去处理问题的时候，它们就会出来表示“抗议”，并且自发地发生强制作用。恩格斯早就说过：“社会的力量，正如自然的力量一样，在未被我们认识到和算计到以前，发生着盲目的、强制的、破坏的作用。可是一经我们认识了它，研究了它的作用、方向及影响，那时就完全听凭我们来使它更多地服从于我们的意志，并且利用它来达到我们的目的。”（“反杜林论”，第293页）
    在生产资料实现了公有化以后，人们成了自己社会生活的主人，这就不但有可能认识客观存在的经济规律，而且有可能自觉地利用客观经济规律来为社会主义事业服务。但是，这并不是说，人们都已经认识了它们并且善于利用它们。要把这种可能性变为现实，还有待于我们的努力。我们必须在经济建设的实践中，经常分析情况，经常研究问题，经常总结经验。认识从实践开始。离开实践是不可能认识客观的经济规律的。同时，我们还要从事理论学习，也就是通过政治经济学的学习，来提高我们的理论水平，更好地总结我们的实际经验，帮助我们把感性认识提高到理性认识的阶段，以便在理论的指导下，把我们的经济工作做得更好。只有这样，才能使我们的社会主义建设的实践符合于客观的经济规律，也才能充分发挥我们在工作中的主观能动性。
