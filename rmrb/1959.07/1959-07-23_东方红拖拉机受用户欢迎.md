Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou - The Dongfanghong brand tractor manufactured by the Luoyang No. 1 Tractor Factory has received favorable comments from users.

The Henan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences has been using this type of tractor since October of last year. According to their tillage experiments, this tractor is convenient to operate, powerful, and fuel-efficient. Each tractor, equipped with a five-bottom plow with a width of more than two meters, can plow approximately 120 mu of land in ten hours, with a plowing depth of 32 centimeters. The diesel consumption is 0.61 kilograms per mu. The Yanshi Tractor Station used the Dongfanghong brand tractor with a three-bottom plow and could typically plow to a depth of 50 to 60 centimeters. A mechanical team from the Jingzhou Zhanghe Reservoir project in Hubei Province also used this type of tractor during construction. They used it for more than 1,000 hours without any problems. These units, as well as some users in Hebei, Gansu, Northeast China, and other places, have written to the Luoyang No. 1 Tractor Factory praising the Dongfanghong brand tractor for being economical, durable, easy to use, and having excellent performance.

The Luoyang No. 1 Tractor Factory has implemented the principle of simultaneous construction and production. From August of last year to the present, it has successively manufactured one hundred and several tens of Dongfanghong brand 54-horsepower diesel tractors.

    东方红拖拉机受用户欢迎
    据新华社郑州讯　洛阳第一拖拉机制造厂制造的东方红牌拖拉机，得到了用户的好评。
    河南省农业科学研究所从去年10月开始使用这种拖拉机，根据他们的耕作实验，这种拖拉机操作便利，力量大，耗油少。每台拖拉机带着幅度两米以上的五铧犁，十小时能耕地一百二十亩左右，耕深三十二厘米。耕一亩地耗柴油零点六一公斤。偃师拖拉机站用东方红牌拖拉机挂上三铧犁，通常能耕深五十厘米到六十厘米。湖北省荆州漳河水库工程的一个机械大队在施工中也使用了这种拖拉机，他们使用了一千多小时没有发生一点毛病。这些单位以及河北、甘肃、东北等地的一些用户都写信给洛阳第一拖拉机制造厂，称赞东方红牌拖拉机经济耐用，使用便利，性能很好。
    洛阳第一拖拉机制造厂贯彻边建设边生产的方针，从去年8月到现在已经陆续制造了一百几十台东方红牌五十四马力柴油拖拉机。
