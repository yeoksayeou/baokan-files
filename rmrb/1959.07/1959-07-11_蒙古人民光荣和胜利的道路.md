The 38th anniversary of the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution is commemorated today. This year, joyous news has been coming one after another from the Mongolian People's Republic: the task of socialist transformation of the national economy has been basically completed throughout the country; new achievements have been made on all production fronts; and the people of the whole country are striving to complete the Three-Year Plan ahead of schedule and prepare to enter the stage of building socialism. The great achievements of our close neighbor fill the people of our country with immense excitement.

In thirty-eight years, the Mongolian people have traversed a path that other countries must take many centuries to complete. Before the revolution, Mongolia's economy was very backward, with no industry at all, and handicrafts as an independent production sector were still in their infancy. The legacy inherited by the Mongolian People's Republic from the old system was only a very primitive method of animal husbandry, with the basic residents living a nomadic life. After liberation in 1921, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party immediately led the people in carrying out the democratic revolution, and in 1940 basically completed the arduous task of eliminating feudalism, and turned to the stage of socialist revolution and socialist construction. By the end of the Second Five-Year Plan in 1957, Mongolia already possessed many emerging light and heavy industries and transportation, and the industrial output value had accounted for 41% of the total industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production value. Last year and this year, with the help of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, Mongolia has newly built and expanded some industrial and mining enterprises, and the proportion of modern industry has increased somewhat. The development of animal husbandry, as the most important sector of the national economy, has also been rapid. In March of this year, the Third Plenary Session of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party announced that Mongolia had basically realized the collectivization of agriculture and animal husbandry, and the entire national economy had become a single socialist economy. The alliance of workers and collective herdsmen led by the working class in Mongolia has become even more consolidated. This great victory of the Mongolian people is of great significance for promoting the development of productive forces. At the same time, the conclusion of the 21st Congress of the CPSU that socialist countries will transition to communist society at roughly the same time has also greatly encouraged the Mongolian people. In order to adapt to the new domestic and international situation, the Mongolian Great People's Hural decided in early April this year to revise the draft of the Three-Year Plan for 1958-1960, stipulating that by 1960, the total number of livestock in the country will increase by 7.2% compared with 1957, reaching 25 million head; the total industrial output value will increase by 53.2% compared with 1957; the agricultural sowing area will reach 257,000 hectares, the sowing and harvesting of grain will be mechanized, and the wheat production in 1961 will be able to meet the needs of the people for flour; and the wages of employees and the cash income of cooperative members will also be greatly increased. At present, the Mongolian working people are, with the help of Soviet technicians, carrying out large-scale land reclamation work in order to quickly achieve domestic grain self-sufficiency and establish a livestock feed base to solve the settlement problem of herdsmen. Comrade Tsende, Second Secretary of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, said that under the leadership of the Party, the Mongolian people will complete the Three-Year Plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it with high labor enthusiasm, thereby entering the stage of building socialism.

Lenin pointed out decades ago that "backward countries, with the help of the proletariat in the most advanced countries, can skip the stage of capitalist development, transition to the Soviet system, and, after a certain stage of development, transition to communism." The diligent and courageous Mongolian people have already confirmed Lenin's great prediction with their own glorious example. The victory achieved by the Mongolian people is the victory of Marxism-Leninism, and it is one of the obvious examples of the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system. This victory has added a bright color to the thriving socialist world.

While carrying out peaceful construction, the Mongolian people, together with the socialist camp and all peace-loving countries in the world, are also committed to the struggle to safeguard world peace. Mongolia's peaceful foreign policy and its just stand in international affairs have been highly praised by peace-loving people all over the world. The Mongolian People's Republic adheres to the principle of peaceful coexistence among countries and unswervingly expands its international contacts and cooperation, and has established diplomatic relations with countries accounting for more than half of the world's total population. The Mongolian People's Republic has a history of thirty-eight years, and it is an independent, democratic, and peace-loving sovereign state. During the Second World War, it stood on the side of the Allied countries, providing economic resources and armed forces, and made its own contribution to the cause of world peace and security. The Mongolian People's Republic has every right to become a member of the United Nations. From 1946 to the present, it has submitted applications to the United Nations several times, and the 10th UN General Assembly in 1955 also passed a proposal for Mongolia to join the United Nations with an overwhelming majority of 52 votes, but this proposal was shelved because the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which occupied the seat under the instigation of the United States, created disturbances in the Security Council. The United States' obstruction of Mongolia's accession to the United Nations is a complete violation of the UN Charter and is completely unpopular. The Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council's call for a "Mongolia Day" to support the Mongolian People's Republic's accession to the United Nations can illustrate this point. The people of our country warmly respond to the call of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council and resolutely condemn the United States' unreasonable attitude.

China and Mongolia are fraternal neighbors. Whether in the past revolutionary struggles or in the current cause of socialist construction, we have always actively supported and cooperated closely with each other. In the future, the governments and peoples of our two countries will continue to work hard to consolidate and develop this fraternal friendship in order to continuously enhance mutual assistance and cooperation, accelerate the socialist construction of our two countries, and jointly strive to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and to safeguard world peace and security.

### 蒙古人民光荣和胜利的道路

    蒙古人民光荣和胜利的道路
    今天是蒙古人民革命胜利三十八周年纪念日。今年，从蒙古人民共和国接二连三地传来令人欢欣鼓舞的消息：国民经济的社会主义改造任务在全国范围内基本完成了；各个生产战线都取得新的成就；全国人民正在努力争取提前超额完成三年计划，准备进入建成社会主义阶段。我们亲密邻邦的这些伟大成就，使我国人民感到无比的兴奋。
    蒙古人民在三十八年中走过了别的国家必须经历许多世纪才能走完的道路。革命前蒙古的经济非常落后，根本没有工业，作为独立生产部门的手工业，还处在萌芽状态。蒙古人民共和国从旧制度继承的遗产，只有经营方法非常原始的牧畜业，基本居民都过着游牧生活。1921年解放后，蒙古人民革命党立即领导人民进行民主革命，1940年基本上完成了消灭封建主义的艰巨任务，并转入社会主义革命和社会主义建设阶段。到1957年第二个五年计划结束时，蒙古已经拥有不少新兴的轻、重工业和运输业，工业产值已占工、农、牧业生产总值的41％。去年和今年，在苏联和其它兄弟国家的帮助下，蒙古又新建和扩建了一些工矿企业，现代化工业的比重又有了若干增长。作为国民经济最主要部门的畜牧业的发展也很迅速。今年3月，蒙古人民革命党三中全会宣布，蒙古已基本上实现了农牧业合作化，整个国民经济已经成为单一的社会主义经济。蒙古国内以工人阶级为领导的、工人和集体牧民的联盟更加巩固了。蒙古人民的这一伟大胜利，对促进生产力的发展具有重大意义。同时，苏共第二十一次代表大会关于社会主义国家将大致同时过渡到共产主义社会的论断，也给蒙古人民以很大的鼓舞。为了适应国内和国际的新形势，蒙古大人民呼拉尔今年4月初决定修改1958年—1960年的三年计划草案，规定到1960年，全国牲畜的总头数将比1957年增加7.2％，达到二千五百万头；工业总产值将比1957年提高53.2％；农业播种面积将达到二十五万七千公顷，谷物的播种和收割工作将实现机械化，1961年小麦的产量将可以满足全国人民对面粉的需要；全国职工工资和合作社社员的现金收入也有很大增加。目前，蒙古劳动人民正在苏联技术人员的帮助下，进行大规模的垦荒工作，以便迅速争取国内粮食自给，并建立畜牧业饲料基地，解决牧民的定居问题。蒙古人民革命党中央委员会第二书记曾德同志说，蒙古人民在党的领导下，将以高涨的劳动热情，提前和超额完成三年计划，从而进入建成社会主义的阶段。
    列宁在几十年前就曾指出：“落后的国家得到最先进的国家中无产阶级的帮助，便能够越过资本主义的发展阶段，过渡到苏维埃制度，并经过一定的发展阶段，过渡到共产主义”。勤劳勇敢的蒙古人民已经用自己的光荣榜样，证实了列宁的伟大预言。蒙古人民所取得的胜利，是马克思列宁主义的胜利，是社会主义制度较之资本主义制度具有无比优越性的明显例证之一。这个胜利使正在欣欣向荣的社会主义世界增添了鲜艳的颜色。
    蒙古人民在进行和平建设的同时，也同社会主义阵营各国和全世界爱好和平的国家一起，致力于维护世界和平的斗争。蒙古的和平外交政策和它在国际事务中的严正立场，得到全世界爱好和平人民很高的评价。蒙古人民共和国恪守各国人民和平共处的原则，坚定不移地扩大自己的国际联系和合作，已经同占全世界总人口半数以上的国家建立了外交关系。蒙古人民共和国已经有三十八年的历史，它是一个独立的、民主的和爱好和平的主权国家。在第二次世界大战期间，它站在同盟国方面，提供了经济资源和武装力量，为世界的和平和安全事业作出了自己的贡献。蒙古人民共和国有充分的权利成为联合国的会员国。从1946年到现在，它曾经几次向联合国提出申请，1955年第十届联合国大会也曾以五十二票的压倒多数，通过蒙古加入联合国的建议，只是由于美国指使窃据席位的蒋介石集团在安理会中捣乱，这项建议才被搁置下来。美国阻挠蒙古加入联合国是完全违反联合国宪章的，也是完全不得人心的。亚非人民团结理事会号召举行“蒙古日”，支持蒙古人民共和国加入联合国，正可以说明这一点。我国人民热烈响应亚非人民团结理事会的号召，坚决谴责美国蛮横无理的态度。
    中蒙两国是兄弟邻国，无论在过去的革命斗争和现在的社会主义建设事业中，我们相互之间一向都积极支援和密切合作。今后，我们两国政府和人民将继续努力巩固和发展这种兄弟友谊，以便不断地增进互助合作，加速我们两国的社会主义建设，并为加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，为维护世界和平和安全而共同奋斗。
