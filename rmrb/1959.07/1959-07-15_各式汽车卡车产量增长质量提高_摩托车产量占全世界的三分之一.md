Xinhua News Agency, Prague Telegram: Czechoslovakia's automobile industry overfulfilled its production plan for the first half of this year. Automobile production exceeded the plan by 2%, while truck and motorcycle production exceeded the plan by 3%.

    This year, Czechoslovakia will produce approximately 50,000 automobiles, an increase of 10% compared to last year and two and a half times higher than the highest pre-war annual output. Starting from the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan (1961), Czechoslovakia will further expand automobile production, with projected output significantly increasing by 1965. Czechoslovakian-made automobiles are not only popular domestically but also enjoy a good reputation in foreign markets. For example, the world-renowned Skoda automobile currently has an annual output of approximately 36,000 vehicles, with 60% exported and sold in sixty-one countries. The automotive industry is now working to further improve the Skoda automobile. The improved new Skoda automobile will begin production in 1963. By 1965, the annual output of this brand of automobile will reach 100,000 vehicles. In addition, the Czechoslovakian-produced Tatra automobile, in terms of style, quality, and speed (170 kilometers per hour), can be compared to the world's first-class automobiles. Due to Czechoslovakia's advanced machinery manufacturing industry, it has favorable conditions for the production of large heavy-duty trucks and buses. The output of these vehicles in the first half of this year increased by 22% compared to the same period last year. According to the division of labor within the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance of socialist countries, Czechoslovakia is vigorously developing the production of high-quality large trucks with payloads of five, seven, and ten tons to meet the needs of other fraternal countries. It is projected that the output of large trucks will at least double during the Third Five-Year Plan.

    Czechoslovakia produces one-third of the world's motorcycles, with an annual output of more than 300,000 vehicles. However, this still cannot meet the needs of domestic and foreign markets. Currently, Czechoslovakian motorcycles are exported to 110 countries, making them a major export item for the country's machinery manufacturing industry.

    各式汽车卡车产量增长质量提高
    摩托车产量占全世界的三分之一
    新华社布拉格电　捷克斯洛伐克汽车工业超额完成了今年上半年的生产计划。小汽车的生产超额完成计划2％，大卡车和摩托车的生产分别超额完成计划3％。
    今年捷克斯洛伐克将生产小汽车约五万辆，比去年增加10％，比战前最高年产量增加两倍半。从第三个五年计划的第一年（1961年）开始，捷克斯洛伐克还将进一步扩大小汽车的生产，预计到1965年时，小汽车的产量将大大增加。捷克斯洛伐克生产的小汽车不但深受国内人民的喜爱，而且在国外市场上也有着良好的声誉。例如，世界闻名的斯科达牌小汽车，目前其年产量约为三万六千辆，其中60％是输出的，畅销在六十一个国家。现在汽车工业部门正着手进一步改进斯科达牌的小汽车。经过改进的新型的斯科达牌小汽车将在1963年开始生产。到1965年时，这种牌子的小汽车年产量将达到十万辆。此外，捷克斯洛伐克出产的塔特拉牌小汽车，无论在式样、质量和行车速度（每小时一百七十公里）等方面都可以与世界第一流的汽车相媲美。由于捷克斯洛伐克机器制造业的发达，因此在生产大型载重卡车和公共汽车方面具有良好的条件。今年上半年上述汽车的产量就比去年同时期增长了22％。根据社会主义国家经济互助委员会的分工，捷克斯洛伐克正在大力发展载重五吨、七吨和十吨的质量良好的大型卡车的生产，以满足其他兄弟国家的需要。预计在第三个五年计划内大型卡车的产量将至少增长一倍。
    捷克斯洛伐克生产的摩托车占全世界摩托车生产的三分之一，目前它的年产量达三十多万辆，但仍不能满足国内外市场的需要。现在，捷克斯洛伐克的摩托车输往一百一十个国家，为本国机器制造业出口的大宗项目之一。
