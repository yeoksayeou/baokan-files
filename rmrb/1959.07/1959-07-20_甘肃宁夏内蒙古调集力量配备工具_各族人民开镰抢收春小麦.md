Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, July 19th: Spring wheat harvesting has begun in Gansu.

In many areas, the wheat harvesting teams are strong, well-manned, and equipped with complete tools. In the Yinji, Nanlong, and Maji communes of Linxia City, Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, and the Liuchuan and Maiji communes of Hezheng County, there are sufficient vehicles, sickles, and winnowing machines. In Liuchuan Commune, each laborer has two sickles and a wheat-binding rope. To prevent sudden attacks from autumn floods and hail, a rapid harvesting and threshing campaign is underway in areas where wheat harvesting has begun. Commune members have put forward the slogan: Not only must we harvest quickly, but we must also harvest cleanly, ensuring that every grain is stored in the granary.

This year, Gansu's spring wheat planting area accounts for more than one-fifth of the country's total spring wheat area, mainly concentrated in the three special districts and autonomous prefecture of Dingxi, Linxia, and Zhangye. Dingxi Special District's spring wheat accounts for more than 40% of the province's total. According to the person in charge of the CPC Dingxi Prefectural Committee, this year's spring wheat in the plain areas of Dingxi Special District is very good, and the mountain areas are even better, with the mountain areas' spring wheat being the best in many years. The same is true for Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture and Zhangye Special District, with spring wheat in many areas having many stalks, thick stems, large ears, and plump grains.

This year, Gansu's spring wheat has benefited from the province-wide high-yield competition, with deeper plowing and denser planting than in any previous year. During the growth process, various regions also overcame disasters such as diseases, pests, and lodging. Therefore, as the harvest season arrives, all regions attach great importance to summarizing this year's high-yield experiences. Currently, various regions are combining high-yield wheat field evaluations with mass summary activities through methods such as observation, comparison, and calculation, requiring that not only spring wheat achieve a high yield and harvest, but also that the work of summarizing production experience achieve a bumper harvest.

Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, July 19th: At the foot of the Liupan Mountains in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and along the banks of the Yellow River, the fragrance of wheat permeates thousands of miles. The more than 2.5 million mu of wheat, mainly spring wheat, is generally ripe, and the intense wheat harvest is fully underway from south to north. By the 15th, more than 400,000 mu of wheat in the region had been harvested.

Before the wheat harvest, people's communes in various regions made full preparations. In order to ensure that more than 80% of the labor force is投入into summer harvesting, communes generally launched a concentrated campaign before the summer harvest to process and manage autumn fields and transport the base fertilizer needed for summer-sown crops to the fields. As soon as the summer harvest season arrived, they concentrated their efforts to rush the harvest. Communes formed specialized teams for harvesting, transportation, replanting, threshing, and delivering public grain purchases, based on the strength and technical expertise of their members, and took comprehensive action. Cadres, workers, students, and troops in various regions, led by responsible comrades, also helped commune members with the harvest. Some county and city commercial departments, under the slogan of "Bring sickles to the countryside, harvest and sell," organized delivery teams and peddlers to go to various harvesting areas, harvesting and selling goods at the same time. Medical personnel also brought medicine to the fields, providing treatment to the sick and harvesting when there were no sick people.

In order to ensure the quality of the harvest, some communes also held wheat-cutting skill competitions and on-site observation meetings for rapid harvesting and careful threshing, summarizing experiences and imparting techniques in a timely manner. Many communes also achieved simultaneous harvesting, plowing, and planting, promptly planting autumn crops such as vegetables after harvesting the wheat fields.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, July 19th: More than 1.2 million mu of spring wheat on the Hetao Plain in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has generally ripened, and harvesting began around the 15th. Now, more than 85% of the farmers of all ethnic groups on the plain, celebrating the bumper harvest, have投入into the great battle of wheat harvesting. In Hangjinhou Banner, more than 85,000 laborers are harvesting wheat day and night under the slogan of "Ripe one piece, harvest one piece, harvest one piece, transport one piece." Commune members in Linhe County, in accordance with the spirit of "Harvest cleanly, transport cleanly, thresh cleanly, winnow cleanly," have organized various shock teams to harvest and thresh intensively. In recent days, cadres, workers, troops, students, and urban residents in various banners and counties have formed support teams and gone to the countryside in batches to help farmers harvest wheat.

Spring wheat is the main grain crop on the Hetao Plain, accounting for more than 30% of the total grain crop area. Since communization, commune members in various banners and counties have conscientiously implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, practiced rational close planting, applied more fertilizer, carefully selected seeds, and irrigated in a timely manner. This year's wheat is growing unprecedentedly strong, and the grains are very plump. Currently, five spring wheat high-yield experience summary teams have gone to five banners and counties to summarize the experience of large-scale high yield of spring wheat this year.

    甘肃宁夏内蒙古调集力量配备工具
    各族人民开镰抢收春小麦
    新华社兰州19日电　甘肃春小麦开始收割。
    许多地区麦收班子人强马壮，工具齐全。临夏回族自治州临夏市的尹集、南龙、马集等公社，和政县的流川、买集等公社，车辆、镰刀、风车样样充足。流川公社每个劳动力都有两把镰刀，一条捆麦绳。为了防止秋季洪水和冰雹的突然袭击，开始割麦地区正在展开快收快打运动。社员们提出口号：不但要收得快，而且要收得净，做到粒粒归仓。
    甘肃今年春小麦播种面积占全国春小麦面积的五分之一强，主要集中在定西、临夏、张掖等三个专区和自治州。定西专区春小麦占全省的40％以上。据中共定西地委负责人谈，今年定西专区春小麦川区很好，山区更好，山区春小麦是多少年来最好的一年。临夏回族自治州和张掖专区也有同样情况，许多地区春小麦株多秆粗，穗大粒饱。
    今年甘肃的春小麦因为开展了全省范围的丰产竞赛，深耕、密植比以往任何一年都做得好。在生长过程中，各地还战胜了病虫、倒伏等灾害。因此，在收获期到来之际，各地都非常重视总结今年的丰产经验。现在，各地正结合麦田丰产评比，通过看、比、算等办法，展开群众性的总结活动，要求做到不但春小麦丰产丰收，同时也要使生产经验的总结工作获得丰收。
    据新华社银川19日电　宁夏回族自治区的六盘山前，黄河两岸，麦香千里。以春小麦为主的二百五十多万亩小麦普遍黄熟，紧张的麦收，从南到北全面展开。到15日全区已有四十多万亩小麦登场。
    麦收前，各地人民公社都进行了充分的准备工作。为了保证80％以上的劳力投入夏收，各公社在夏收前普遍突击进行秋田加工管理和把夏播作物需要的基肥运到田头。夏收季节一到，就集中力量抢收。各公社按社员的劳力强弱和技术特长，组成了收割、拉运、复种、打场、交公购粮等专业班子，全面行动。各地干部、职工、学生和部队在负责同志的带领下，也帮助社员抢收。有些县、市的商业部门在“下乡带镰刀，收割又推销”的口号下，组织了送货小组和货郎担，分赴各收割区，边收割、边售货，医务人员也带药下田，有病看病，无病收割。
    为了保证收割质量，有些公社还举行了割麦比巧会和快收细打现场观摩会，及时总结经验，传授技术。不少公社还作到了边收、边耕、边种，收完麦田，及时种上了蔬菜等秋收作物。
    新华社呼和浩特19日电　内蒙古自治区河套平原上的一百二十多万亩春小麦已普遍黄熟，15日前后就陆续开镰收割。现在，平原上喜庆丰收的各族农民，已有85％以上投入了麦收大战。杭锦后旗八万五千多名劳动力，正在“熟一片、割一片，割一片、拉一片”的口号下，夜以继日地收割小麦。临河县的社员们按照“割净、拉净、打净、扬净”的精神，组织了各种突击队，紧张地收割和拉打。各旗县的干部、工人、部队、学生和城镇居民等，这几天都组成了支援队伍，分批开赴农村，帮助农民抢收小麦。
    春小麦是河套平原上的主要粮食作物，占粮食作物总面积的30％以上。由于公社化后各旗县社员认真贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，实行了合理密植，多施肥料，精选籽种和灌溉及时，今年的小麦长得空前茁壮，籽粒十分饱满。现在，五个小麦丰产经验总结组，已分赴五个旗县总结今年春小麦的大面积丰产经验。
