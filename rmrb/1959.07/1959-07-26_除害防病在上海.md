    Pest Elimination and Disease Prevention in Shanghai
    Found the Old Nest
    We swat mosquitoes and catch mosquito larvae every day, so why are we still bitten by mosquitoes at night? Residents living near Liyuan Road and Mengzi Road in Luwan District have had this question this year. They thought that if there are so many mosquitoes, there must be a source. Therefore, active elements in sanitation work mobilized all residents to find the breeding grounds of mosquitoes. Everyone focused on a large empty house on Mengzi Road that had been unoccupied for several months. However, there were no rivers or ponds in the house, so how could mosquitoes breed? Later, after the masses searched everywhere, they discovered mosquito larvae in the sewers. So they opened all 220 drainage ditches in this large empty house. It turned out that this sewer system had been blocked for a long time due to lack of dredging, making it a good place for breeding mosquitoes. As soon as the masses discovered this secret, they launched into battle at 3:30 the next morning. Within one day, they eliminated all the mosquito larvae in more than 220 drainage ditches.
    Thorough Inspection
    In the afternoon, the inspection team from Tilanqiao District arrived at Huili Ranch.

    This ranch raises 120 dairy cows, 50 pigs, and more than 2,000 chickens and ducks. Feed and animal manure bring many troubles to the ranch's sanitation work. The ranch has always been considered a breeding ground for mosquitoes and flies.

    This inspection team, composed of neighborhood residents, workers, and students, were all pest control experts and sanitation activists. Zhang Su'e, 54, and Lu Meiju, 46, were the most experienced. Just by looking at the color of the stagnant water and smelling the odor of the soil, they could tell whether there were mosquito larvae or fly pupae. Today, they inspected the processing workshop and carefully dug through every drainage ditch and every damp corner with small shovels. Sometimes, they even pried open the sewer covers to inspect, without finding a single fly or mosquito larva. Then, they went to the cow shed, where mosquitoes and flies are most likely to breed. The walls were painted snow-white, fly swatters were hung at every door, the air circulated well, and there was no foul smell. Zhang Su'e shone a flashlight under the troughs and around the feed tanks for a while and happily said: "Very clean, very satisfactory!" Finally, they saw sewage in the ditch next to the pigsty that had not been flushed in time, which they considered to be the only drawback of this ranch.
    Delivering Fertilizer
    On July 9th, the garbage wharf on Suzhou Creek was particularly lively, with shop assistants and residents from Huangpu District bustling to transport truckloads of fertilizer. This was the sludge they had painstakingly scooped out of thousands of drainage ditches in the district all day, ready to be transported to Jiading County in the suburbs to support agricultural production.

    That day, just after 7:00 in the morning, the chimes on Nanjing Road rang. Before the shops opened, the shop assistants cleaned the streets and indoor areas spotlessly. Employees of stores such as the Xinhua Bookstore's First Bookstore also formed teams to take turns on duty in sections, sweeping up dirt as they saw it and conducting hygiene propaganda for pedestrians. In addition, dozens of shop assistants formed a ditch-digging team, digging through all the drainage ditches on Nanjing Road. By the afternoon, they had dug a total of 2,000 jin of ditch mud, which they personally delivered to the garbage wharf in eight trucks.

    Huangpu District's system of regular sanitation has been maintained for four or five years. They also arranged the three "nine" days of each month as "first nine" for cleaning the roads, "second nine" for cleaning indoor sanitation, and "third nine" for tidying up storefronts. Since the beginning of this year, they have also combined street cleaning with fertilizer accumulation. From January to June this year, shop assistants and residents throughout the district accumulated 164,045 tons of fertilizer. (Image attached)

    除害防病在上海
    找到了老窝
    每天打蚊子、捉孑孓，为什么晚上还是有蚊子咬人？住在卢湾区丽园路蒙自路一带的居民今年都有这样的疑问。他们想，蚊子多，总是有根的，于是卫生工作积极分子们发动全体居民一起来找寻蚊子的孳生地。大家集中注意到蒙自路上有一所已经有好几个月没人住的大空屋，可是屋子里没有河浜，也没有池子，怎么能繁殖蚊虫呢。后来经过群众东找西寻，发现了下水道里有孑孓，于是把这所大空屋里的二百二十只阴沟全部打开来，原来这个下水道系统由于久不疏通而堵塞了，正是孳生蚊子的好场所。群众一发现这个秘密，次日清早三时半就投入战斗。一天内把二百二十多只阴沟里的孑孓全部消灭了。
    深入的检查
    下午，提篮桥区的检查队来到了汇利牧场。
    这个牧场饲养着一百二十头乳牛、五十头猪、二千多只鸡鸭。饲料、动物的粪便，给场里的卫生工作带来不少麻烦。牧场一向被认为是蚊蝇的孳生地。
    这批由里弄居民、工人、学生组成的检查队，都是除四害能手、卫生积极分子。五十四岁的张素娥和四十六岁的陆梅菊最有经验，只要她们看一看积水的颜色，闻一下泥土的气味，就知道有没有孑孓、蝇蛹。今天她们在这里检查了加工车间，并且对每一条阴沟，每个阴湿的角落，都用小铲挖过，仔细地看过。有时还撬开了下水道的沟盖检查，没有发现一只苍蝇、一只孑孓。接着她们到了蚊蝇最容易繁殖的牛房里，墙壁粉刷得雪白，每个门口都挂着蝇拍，空气流通，闻不到臭味。张素娥用手电筒在槽下、饲料缸四周照了一阵，高兴地说：“很清爽，真服贴！”她们最后在猪圈旁边看到阴沟里有污水，没有及时冲洗，认为是这个牧场唯一的缺点。
    送肥料
    7月9日，苏州河的垃圾码头上特别热闹，黄浦区的店员和居民们熙熙攘攘地运来了一车车的肥料。这是他们辛苦了一天在区内的几千只阴沟里掏出来的泥浆，准备运往市郊嘉定县去支援农业生产。
    这一天，早晨刚过七时，南京路上的钟声响了。店员们趁着还没有开市，就把街道和室内卫生打扫得一干二净。新华书店第一书店等商店的职工们还组成小组，分地段轮流值班，一面见脏就扫，一面对行人作卫生宣传。另外还有几十个店员组成了挖沟泥小队，把南京路上的阴沟全部挖了一遍，到下午，他们一共挖到二千斤沟泥，分成八车亲自送到了垃圾码头。
    黄浦区经常打扫卫生的制度已经坚持四、五年了，他们并把一个月中的三个“九”日，安排为“头九”打扫马路，“二九”打扫室内卫生，“三九”整洁门面。今年以来，他们还把打扫马路同积肥结合起来。从今年1月到6月，全区店员和居民就积肥十六万四千零四十五吨。（附图片）
