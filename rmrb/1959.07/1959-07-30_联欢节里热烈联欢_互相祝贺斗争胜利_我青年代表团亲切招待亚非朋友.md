Xinhua News Agency, Vienna News: On the third day of the World Youth and Students Peace and Friendship Festival, the various activities of the festival continued. On this day, the Chinese Youth Delegation hosted African friends at their residence and visited the Iraqi Youth Delegation, fully demonstrating the close friendship and unity between China and the youth of Asian and African countries.

Congratulating African Friends on Achieving Final Victory

The Chinese Youth Delegation participating in the 7th World Youth Festival held a grand gathering at their residence on the morning of the 28th to entertain young friends from twenty-eight countries in Africa, including Madagascar, Togo, Belgian Congo, Ivory Coast, Uganda, Ghana, French Sudan, Kenya, and Guinea. This meeting and gathering fully demonstrated their determination to defend peace and their spirit of unity.

After ten o'clock, the guests arrived one after another. Chinese and African youth had never met before, were thousands of miles apart, spoke different languages, and had different skin colors, but all this could not prevent them from talking to each other.

The hosts cordially entertained their African friends, offering them peanuts and sweets brought from their homeland, and opening Chinese pictorials to introduce the construction and life of the Chinese people to their friends. The African friends listened with great interest to the Chinese friends' explanations, gesturing as they spoke. Diop Youssouf, a representative from Dakar, French West Africa, said, "We are very happy to be warmly invited by our Chinese friends to hold this meeting and get-together, because the struggle of the Chinese people has given the African people a worthy example to learn from. At present, the African people are carrying out an unyielding struggle against colonial rule and for national independence, and today's meeting with Chinese friends will surely give us new strength."

The African guests also introduced the struggle and life of their people and their desire for peace and freedom to the Chinese friends. One African youth, while flipping through a Chinese picture album, saw a photo of Chairman Mao with representatives of African youth and shouted with joy when he recognized a friend.

The hall was filled with a warm, united, and friendly atmosphere. Everyone exchanged gifts with their own national characteristics and left their contact information.

At the same time as the get-together, Liu Xiyuan, the head of the Chinese Youth Delegation, had a cordial conversation with some African youth representatives. He raised his glass and said, "The victory of Africa will ultimately belong to the African people. Let us drink to the victory of the African people's struggle." Ali Bokar, Chairman of the African Youth Council, said: The African people must break the colonial system.

Finally, Chinese artists performed wonderful programs for the guests.

Spending the Festival with Iraqi Youth, Raising Hands and Calling for Sino-Iraqi Friendship

On the 28th, the Chinese Youth Delegation was invited to visit in a beautiful garden in Vienna, and spent a pleasant afternoon with the host, the Iraqi Youth Delegation. During the meeting, people frequently raised their hands and shouted "Iraq-China. Iraq-China." to express the unbreakable friendship and unity between the people of the two countries.

As the host, Raheem Al-Ajeenan, head of the Iraqi delegation, spoke at the meeting. He emphasized that there is a deep friendship and connection between the youth of Iraq and China. He said that no force will be allowed to damage this friendship and connection.

Next, Zhu Yujin, deputy head of the Chinese Youth Delegation, spoke, first expressing his gratitude for the invitation from Iraqi friends, and wishing the people of the two countries closer unity in their common struggle. Their speeches were constantly interrupted by enthusiastic applause and slogans. After the speeches, the two sides exchanged gifts. (Attached picture)

    非洲客人们也向中国朋友们介绍了本国人民的斗争生活和热爱和平自由的愿望。有一位非洲青年在翻阅中国画册时，看到在一张毛主席和非洲青年代表的合影中有自己认识的朋友时，高兴得叫了起来。
    大厅中洋溢着热烈的、团结友爱的气氛。大家彼此交换自己富有民族特色的礼物，留下通信处。
    联欢的同时，中国青年代表团团长刘西元与一些非洲青年代表进行了亲切的交谈，他高举起酒杯说：非洲的胜利最后一定属于非洲人民，让我们来为非洲人民斗争的胜利干杯。非洲青年理事会主席阿里·博卡尔说：非洲人民一定要打破殖民制度。
    最后，中国艺术家为客人们表演了精彩节目。
    和伊拉克青年共度佳节  高举双手同呼中伊友好
    28日，在维也纳的一个优美的花园里，中国青年代表团应邀作客，和主人伊拉克青年代表团共同度过了一个愉快的下午。在会见中，人们不时地举起双手高呼“伊拉克—中国。伊拉克—中国。”表示两国人民之间牢不可破的友谊和团结。
    作为主人的伊拉克代表团团长拉黑穆·阿奇南在会见时讲了话。他强调指出，伊中两国青年之间存在着深厚的友情和联系。他说，决不允许任何势力来损害这种友情和联系。
