Comrade Vice Premier Chen Yi! Respected and dear friends!

Today, People's Poland is solemnly celebrating its great festival—the fifteenth anniversary of its birth. Fifteen years is a very short time in the history of a people, but there are also times when, as you emphasized during the Great Leap Forward, one day equals twenty years. Such a period is the period of the Great Leap Forward in the great socialist construction. In this period, the backward people, created by the former rulers, took their destiny into their own hands and eliminated the backwardness left behind for generations. Our recent fifteen-year history is such a period. Our country has never experienced such a leap in development as in this period. In this short period, under the leadership of the revolutionary party, the entire people of our country have not only healed the wounds of war, not only greatly exceeded the level of economic and cultural development during the rule of the exploiting classes, but also been able to stand among the most developed countries in Europe.

Fifteen years ago, when Hitler's forces quickly collapsed under the blows of the powerful Soviet army and the young Polish army fighting alongside it, the Polish Committee of National Liberation—the first people's regime on Polish soil—announced its historic declaration, which became the basic program for further construction after our liberation.

No country in the world has suffered such enormous war losses as our motherland. One in every five Poles lost their lives. Smoking ruins, lonely factory and house remains, millions of homeless people, this is the legacy that the hardworking master—the Polish people—received. But the selfless labor enthusiasm of the working class is an endless force. Under the leadership of the Polish Workers' Party, and later the Polish United Workers' Party, our people created the edifice of the new socialist Poland, overcoming numerous and enormous difficulties, and built this edifice through arduous labor. In this labor, we received the friendly assistance of our great ally—the Soviet Union. Although the Soviet Union was also facing difficulties caused by the war, it still shared what it had with us like a brother.

The line of our construction is understood by the masses of the people. The Party pointed out that only a socialist Poland can be a prosperous and happy country. Therefore, in addition to developing productive forces, we immediately began the work of fundamentally reforming the system. Land reform, nationalization of industry, banks and transportation, these are the measures to ensure continued progress in the right direction. As early as the period of 1947-1949—the first economic plan, the Three-Year Plan period, we rebuilt the country. In the Six-Year Plan of 1950-1955, we completed a huge amount of capital construction work. In the current Five-Year Plan, we continue this work, while also striving to improve the people's living standards as quickly as possible. The following figures are sufficient to illustrate the achievements of this work. Today we produce 289% more steel, 150% more hard coal, 500% more electricity, 316% more sulfuric acid, and 179% more cement than in 1938. Last year, the total industrial output value increased by 420% compared to 1937. Today, although Poland's population accounts for only 1% of the world's population, its industrial production already accounts for about 1.8% of the world's industrial production. Our current level of industrialization is almost twice as high as the world average, but before the war, Poland was below this level.

In order to accelerate the development of agriculture, since 1954, especially after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party in 1956, and the recent Third Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party, our Party has completed a series of changes in agricultural policy in the countryside. These changes are in line with the special conditions of the Polish countryside. These changes contribute to the socialist transformation of the countryside under Polish conditions. The guiding ideology of this new agricultural policy is to develop agricultural production and gradually develop the cooperative movement in the countryside based on the complete voluntariness of the peasants. This policy has already made its own achievements. Today, in terms of agricultural production, Poland averages 465 kilograms of grain, 1,200 kilograms of potatoes, 55 kilograms of meat, and 288 liters of milk per person.

In addition to economic achievements, we have also made great achievements in culture. Illiteracy has been eliminated in Poland. Although the population has decreased, the number of school buildings has increased by 50%. We have never had so many universities, students, and graduates as we do now. Similarly, the current number of publications is also unprecedented in our history. Now, the weekly publication of newspapers and periodicals is equal to the total number of residents in the country. Science is also developing under the meticulous care of the state, and in many aspects has reached the advanced level of the world.

All these achievements are primarily attributable to the correct leadership of our Party and the labor of the entire people who recognize its leadership. These achievements are also inseparable from the help and cooperation of the great socialist camp, especially the most powerful country—the Soviet Union. The unity of the socialist camp and the solidarity of its strength are the basic principles of our Party and our government's policies. Friendship and cooperation based on the ideological unity of the great principles of Marxism-Leninism connect us with the countries of the entire camp. The Polish people, who suffered such enormous material and human losses in World War II, warmly support the Soviet Union's peaceful policy on the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the settlement of the Berlin issue. The Rapacki Plan proposed by Poland to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe is a manifestation of Poland's peaceful policy and its concern for the development of friendly relations with all countries.

Dear friends!

We, who work here in China, are particularly happy because we can celebrate our great festival among our long-tested and strong Chinese friends. Our people are happy for the achievements of your great people, just as we were happy for your military victories in the past. Your historically unprecedented Great Leap Forward inspires our people with genuine enthusiasm and sets an example of labor for our workers and peasants. Our friendship and the constantly strengthening political, economic and cultural cooperation are one of the important factors in our achievements. We believe that this friendship and cooperation will continue to strengthen and develop.

Long live the fraternal friendship and cooperation between the people of Poland and China!

Long live the eternal friendship between People's Poland and the countries of the peace and socialist camp!

Long live the great Soviet Union, the invincible fortress of peace and progress!

Long live the People's Republic of China, the fortress of peace in Asia, and its great leader Comrade Mao Zedong!

    社会主义波兰的大厦雄伟壮丽
    基里洛克大使在首都庆祝波兰国庆大会上的讲话尊敬的陈毅副总理同志！尊敬的和亲爱的朋友们！
    今天，人民波兰正在隆重地庆祝自己的伟大的节日——诞生十五周年。十五年在人民的历史上是很短促的，但是也有这样的时期，正如你们在大跃进时所强调的，一天等于二十年的时期。这样的时期，就是进行伟大的社会主义建设大跃进的时期。在这个时期里，由过去统治者所造成的落后的人民，把命运掌握在自己的手中并且消灭了世世代代遗留下来的落后。我们最近的十五年历史，就是这样的时期。我们的国家从来没有经历过像这个时期那样的飞跃的发展。在这短短的期间里，我国全体人民在革命政党的领导下不仅已经医治好战争的创伤，不仅已经大大地超过剥削阶级统治时代的经济和文化发展的水平，而且也能够屹立于欧洲最发达的国家之间。
    十五年以前，当希特勒的势力在强有力的苏联军队以及同它并肩作战的年青的波兰军队的打击下很快地崩溃的时候，波兰民族解放委员会——波兰土地上的第一个人民政权宣布了自己的历史性的宣言，这一宣言成为我国解放后进一步建设的基本纲领。
    世界上没有一个国家像我们的祖国一样遭受到这样巨大的战争损失。每五名波兰人中有一人失掉了生命。冒烟的废墟，孤零零的工厂和房屋的遗骸，千百万无家可归的人，这就是勤劳的主人——波兰人民所得到的遗产。但是工人阶级忘我的劳动热情是无穷无尽的力量。在波兰工人党，以后在波兰统一工人党的领导下，我国人民创建了新的社会主义波兰的大厦，在克服重重巨大的困难后，在艰苦的劳动中，建立了这所大厦。在这种劳动中，我们得到了我们伟大的同盟者——苏联的朋友式的援助。苏联虽然也面临着战争所造成的困难，但仍像兄弟一样分给我们它所具有的东西。
    我们建设的路线是人民群众所了解的。党指明了，只有社会主义的波兰才能是富强和幸福的国家。所以，除发展生产力外，我们立刻开始了根本改革制度的工作。土地改革，工业、银行和交通运输的国有化，这就是保证继续向着正确方向前进的措施。早在1947—1949年期间——第一个经济计划，即三年计划期间，我们重建了国家。在1950—1955年的六年计划里，我们完成了巨大的基本建设工作。在目前的五年计划中我们继续进行这工作，同时也力求尽可能快地提高人民的生活水平。下面所举的几个数字足以说明这工作的成绩。今天我们比1938年多生产了289％的钢，150％的硬煤，500％的电力，316％的硫酸，和179％的水泥。去年的工业总产值比1937年增长了420％。今天，波兰人口虽然只占世界人口的1％，但它的工业生产已占世界工业生产的1.8％左右。我们目前的工业化的水平几乎高于世界平均水平的一倍，但是在战前波兰是低于这个水平的。
    为了加速农业的发展，从1954年开始，特别是在波兰统一工人党1956年的八中全会以后，以及最近的波兰统一工人党第三次代表大会以后我们的党在农村完成了农业政策的一系列的改变。这些改变是符合波兰农村的特殊条件的。这些改变在波兰的条件下有助于农村的社会主义改革。发展农业生产以及根据农民完全自愿的原则逐步地发展农村中的生产合作运动，是这个新农业政策的指导思想。这个政策已经做出了自己的成绩。今天在农业生产方面，波兰平均每人有四百六十五公斤的粮食，一千二百公斤的土豆，五十五公斤的肉类，和二百八十八公升的牛奶。
    除了经济成就外，我们在文化方面也有伟大的成绩。在波兰已经消除了文盲。虽然人口减少了，但学校校舍的数目却增长了50％。我们从来没有过像现在这么多的高等学校和学生和毕业生。同样，目前书刊的出版数目也是我国历史上所从来没有达到过的。现在，一星期的报刊出版数量等于全国居民的总数。科学在国家无微不至的关怀下也正在发展，并在许多方面达到了世界先进水平。
    我们所有的这些成就，首先应归功于我们党的正确领导和承认它的领导力量的全体人民的劳动。这些成就也是与伟大的社会主义阵营，特别是最强大的国家——苏联的帮助和合作分不开的。社会主义阵营的统一及其力量的团结是我们党和我们政府政策的基本原则。奠基在马克思列宁主义伟大原则的思想统一之上的友谊和合作把我们同整个阵营的国家联系在一起。在第二次世界大战中遭受到如此巨大的物质和人力损失的波兰人民热烈地支持苏联关于缔结对德和约和解决柏林问题的和平政策。波兰提出的关于在中欧建立无原子武器地区的腊帕茨基计划是波兰和平政策和对世界各国的友好关系发展的关怀的表现。
    亲爱的朋友们！
    我们，在中国这里工作的人们，感到特别高兴，因为我们能在我们久经考验的和坚强的中国朋友中间庆祝我们伟大的节日。我们的人民以你们伟大的人民的成就而高兴，像我们过去以你们的军事胜利而高兴一样。你们在历史上空前未有的大跃进以真正的热情鼓舞着我们的人民，并给我们的工人和农民树立了劳动的榜样。我们的友谊和正在不断加强的政治、经济和文化的合作，是我们成就的重要因素之一。我们相信，这种友谊和合作将不断地加强和发展。
    波中两国人民之间的兄弟般友谊和合作万岁！
    人民波兰同和平和社会主义阵营国家的永恒友谊万岁！
    和平和进步的不可战胜的堡垒——伟大的苏联万岁！
    亚洲的和平堡垒——中华人民共和国及其伟大的领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
