The communiqué pointed out that the joint communiqué signed in Moscow regarding the friendly visit of the Party and Government delegation of the German Democratic Republic to the Soviet Union provided thorough answers to all issues related to our common struggle for peace and the security of the European people, especially those related to the peaceful resolution of the vital issues of the German nation.

The communiqué of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party pointed out that the visit of the Party and Government delegation of the German Democratic Republic to the Soviet Union strengthened the German people's belief that in the struggle for the conclusion of a peace treaty, the resolution of the West Berlin issue, and the establishment of a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Germany, the Soviet people are the German people's loyal and reliable allies. The communiqué also emphasized that the visit of the Party and Government delegation of the German Democratic Republic to the Soviet Union has also opened a new stage in economic and scientific-technological cooperation between the two countries.

The communiqué said that fraternal cooperation with the Soviet working people, applying their rich experience in the mechanization, automation, and socialist transformation of production, can greatly help the German Democratic Republic complete its main economic tasks on schedule and accelerate socialist construction, which is of decisive significance in defeating the conspiracies of German militarism and changing the balance of power within West Germany.
