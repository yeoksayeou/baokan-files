Understanding and Helping

Since the establishment of cooperative relationships between industry and commerce in Wuhan City at the beginning of this year, remarkable achievements have been made in promoting production and ensuring supply in just half a year. The benefits of industrial and commercial cooperation are thus evident.

Cooperation is like making friends; both parties need to understand each other. Without understanding, it is difficult to become true friends. Industrial and commercial cooperation is also like this: commercial departments must have a clear understanding of which factories are in the city, what they produce, and their production capacity. With this understanding, they can place orders, sign contracts, and organize production. Factories should not only provide this information to commercial departments but also pay attention to commercial work and understand market conditions, instead of just focusing on production. This kind of investigation and fact-finding work is very necessary. Without mutual understanding and agreement, cooperation will be difficult to achieve. If the Wuhan Department Store had not visited factories throughout the city to understand the situation, wouldn't it still be ordering products such as thermos bottle bamboo shells and cloth shoes from other places, wasting manpower and resources in vain? If the Minquan Pen Factory disregarded market conditions and continued to produce poor-quality pens, wouldn't it hinder the circulation of funds for commercial departments and fail to meet the market's need for test pens?

Cooperation itself requires mutual assistance. Without assistance, there is no cooperation. There are two types of assistance: one is to help after the other party makes a request, and the other is to understand the situation in advance and take proactive measures to help. The mass movement of "Everyone doing a good deed for the factory" and "Everyone making contributions to the factory" launched by the Wuhan Department Store Wholesale Station and other units demonstrates this spirit of proactive assistance. The more proactive the assistance, the better the results. "Helping others is helping yourself."

It seems that understanding and helping are important components of mutual cooperation. Doing these two things well will bring a new look to cooperation.

### 了解和帮助

    了解和帮助
    武汉市工业和商业从今年年初建立协作关系以来，时仅半年，就在促进生产，保证供应上取得显著成绩；工商协作的好处，由此可见一斑。
    协作，好比两人交朋友，彼此都要作一番了解，不了解就难以真正交好朋友。工商协作也是如此：本市有哪些工厂，都是生产甚么，生产能力大小，商业部门一定要心中有数；心中有了数，才能订货，订合同，组织生产。工厂不仅要向商业部门提供这些情况，而且也要关心商业工作，了解市场情况，而不能只管埋头生产。这种调查摸底的工作，是十分需要的，彼此不了解，对不上口径，协作也就难于搞好。武汉百货站如果不是对全市工厂进行访问，摸清了情况，那末，本市能生产的产品如水瓶竹壳，布胶鞋等，岂不仍要从外地订货，徒然耗费人力、财力？民权钢笔厂如果不顾市场情况，继续生产质量差的钢笔，岂不要妨害商业部门资金的流转，同时又不能满足市场对试电笔的需要么？
    协作本身就要求互相帮助。没有帮助，就谈不到协作。帮助，有两种，一种是对方提出了要求，然后想办法帮助；一种是事先了解情况，主动采取措施加以帮助。武汉市百货批发站等单位开展的“人人为工厂做件好事”，“人人为工厂立功”的群众运动，就表现了这种主动帮助的精神。越是主动帮助，效果也就越好。“与人方便，自己方便”。
    看来，了解和帮助是相互协作的重要内容，做好这两件事，协作气象就焕然一新。
