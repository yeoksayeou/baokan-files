Warm Care for Members' Lives
Ningming County, Guangxi, Achieves 30% Increase in "Double 抢" Efficiency

Ningming, July 26th (reporter dispatch) – The 70,000+ farmers in Ningming County, Guangxi, located on the southern border of the motherland, have received multi-faceted care and concern during the rush harvest and planting season (双抢).

In July, the temperature in Ningming County is around 36 degrees Celsius, the hottest time of the year. This month is also a very busy time for agricultural work, with over 100,000 mu of ripe early rice to be harvested, late rice to be transplanted, and an additional 120,000 mu of autumn crops to be planted. Under these hot and labor-intensive conditions, Party committees at all levels have paid special attention to the lives of the masses. At the start of the harvest and planting, people's communes universally built cool shelters at the edges of the fields and threshing grounds for members to rest and cool off. These shelters are equipped with tea water tanks or field canteens, allowing members to get adequate tea water during breaks. Various localities have also adopted methods such as working early in the morning, rushing in the evening, working hard on cloudy days, and resting at noon to speed up the harvesting and planting progress and reduce members' fatigue. During the busy season, the daily ration of members is generally increased by 4 to 5 liang, and each laborer can eat nearly a jin of green vegetables on average each day. More than 1,000 medical personnel throughout the county have gone to the countryside to examine the health of the commune members and treat those who are sick. Because the medical personnel care about the lives and health of the members, the number of sick people in the busy and hot rural areas of Ningming County has greatly decreased compared to previous years.

During the busy labor, all three film projection teams in the county are dispatched to tour and screen films for the members. The amateur cultural troupes and propaganda teams of each commune use the members' rest time to perform for the members or engage in recreational activities with them. Because the lives of the members receive care and attention from all aspects, their enthusiasm for production is even higher, with an attendance rate of over 92%, and labor efficiency is about 30% higher than usual. By the end of July, most areas will be able to complete the summer harvest and summer planting work, and the harvest and planting season is half a month to 20 days earlier than in previous years.

    社员生活得到热情照顾
    广西宁明县“双抢”工效提高30％
    本报宁明26日电　位于祖国南疆的广西宁明县的七万多农民，在抢收抢种中得到多方面的照顾和关怀。
    宁明县的7月，气温都在摄氏三十六度上下，是全年最热的天气。这个月，农活又十分繁重，十几万亩已熟早稻要收上来，晚稻要插下去，还要扩种十二万亩秋种作物。在这天热活重的情况下，各级党委特别重视群众生活。收种开始，各公社普遍在田头、场边搭盖凉棚，供社员休息纳凉。棚内设有饮茶缸或田头食堂，社员可以在休息时得到充足的茶水供应。各地还采取赶早晨、抢晚间，阴天大干、中午休息的办法，加快收种进度和减少社员疲劳。大忙期间，社员每天的口粮一般都增加四两到五两，每个劳动力平均每天可吃到将近一斤的青菜。全县一千多名医务人员下乡给广大社员检查身体，为有病社员治病，由于医务人员关心社员生活和健康，繁忙炎热的宁明县农村，生病的人比往年大为减少。
    在繁忙的劳动中，全县三支电影队都出动为社员巡回放映。各公社的业余文工队、宣传队等，利用社员休息时候，为社员表演或与社员一同进行文娱活动。社员们的生活得到各方面的关怀和照顾，生产积极性更为高涨，出勤率达到92％以上，劳动效率比平时提高30％左右。7月底大部分地区可结束夏收夏种工作，收种季节比往年提早半月到二十天。
