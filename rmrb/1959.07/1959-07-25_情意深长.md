Memories of Frontline Fujian Troops Supporting the Summer Harvest

A few days ago, as soon as the leadership of the troops issued a notice to actively support the commune's summer harvest and planting, everyone automatically began preparing to participate in the harvest. Some took out their own sickles—sickles that had been used for two or three years—and sharpened them again and again. The supply department's straw hats were sold out batch after batch. More people worked overtime to complete their tasks as much as possible in advance. On July 11th, the higher authorities finally issued a notice to "stop office work and military exercises and go to the countryside to support rice harvesting." Everyone was overjoyed!

In the drill ground in front of the political department, people quickly formed teams and headed straight for the Shuitou Brigade of the Xindian Commune. Greeting us at the village entrance was the brigade leader, Tu Yueqing. She and the comrades were old acquaintances. Every year at this time, she greeted the officers and soldiers who came to participate in the labor with gratitude.

Last winter, the officers and soldiers had braved the cold here to accumulate fertilizer. Three months ago, they had planted the lush green rice seedlings here. If we trace back to last year, the year before... in this area of fields, which place is not permeated with the sweat of generals and soldiers! If we trace back even earlier, ten years ago, they had crossed this field to pursue and annihilate the Kuomintang reactionary army and liberate Fuzhou. Eight years ago, the land reform work team of the troops helped the farmers remove the feudalist mountain that was pressing on their heads. When the agricultural cooperative was established, the comrades of the troops helped the farmers organize themselves. During the Great Leap Forward last year, the General Line Propaganda Team of the troops also often came here. This spring, the working group of the political department also worked here with the commune members to consolidate the commune. Many comrades were awarded the title of "Excellent Commune Member" and returned with honor.

The harvest began, and it was truly a fierce battle. No description could do justice to the enthusiasm. The sun was scorching hot, but what did we care? We had competed with it here every year for "light" and "heat." The rice leaves were like small knives, cutting small cuts on the calves, but no one paid attention to them. When someone fell, they got up. When their hands were broken, they put on bandages. At this time, the comrades only thought of one thing: "Every grain to the granary," because every grain was permeated with the sweat of the farmers and themselves, because every grain was a "treasure among treasures," a socialist wealth.

"Comrades, time to stop work!" the commune members shouted loudly.

"No! We will rush to finish harvesting this rice field before going back!" the officers and soldiers replied.

The sickles reflected the setting sun, emitting golden rays, the brilliance of military-civilian friendship, the radiance of a bountiful harvest.

    情意深长
    福建前线部队支援夏收散记
    前几天，部队领导机关刚发出了积极支援公社夏收夏种的通知，大家都自动地做起了参加收割的准备工作。有人拿出了自备的镰刀——这镰刀已经用了两三年了——磨了又磨；服务社的草帽一批一批的卖光了；更多的人加班加点工作，把该做的事尽量提前完成。7月11日，上级终于下达了“停止办公和操课，下乡支援割稻”的通知，谁不高兴万分！
    在政治部门口操场上，人们很快的编好了队，直奔新店公社水头大队。在村头迎接着我们的是大队长涂月清。她和同志们是老相识了。每年这个时候，她都怀着感激的心情，在这里迎接着前来参加劳动的官兵们。
    去年冬天，官兵们在这里冒着寒冷积过肥料，三个月前他们在这里插上了青青的秧苗。如果追溯到去年、前年……，这一带的田地里，那一处不渗透着从将军到战士的汗水呵！如果追溯得更早一些，十年前，他们曾跨过这块田野，追歼国民党反动军队，解放了福州。八年前部队的土改工作队在这里帮助农民搬掉了压在头上的封建主义的大山；成立农业社的时候，部队同志帮助农民组织起来；去年大跃进期间，部队的总路线宣传队也常来这里；今年春天，政治机关的工作组，也是在这里和社员们一起整顿公社。很多同志获得了“优秀社员”的称号，载誉而归。
    收割开始了，这真是一场激烈的战斗。那干劲怎样形容也不过份。太阳像火燎，怕什么，我们年年都在这里和它比赛过“光”和
  “热”；稻叶像小刀，在腿肚子上划开一个个的小口子，没有一个人去理它；摔倒了，爬起来；手破了，用胶布贴起来。这时候同志们心里只想着一件事，那就是“颗粒归仓”，因为这颗颗谷粒都渗透了农民和自己的汗水，因为这颗颗谷粒都是“宝中之宝”，都是社会主义的财富。
      “同志们，收工了！”社员们在高声喊着。
      “不！我们突击割完这块稻田再回去！”官兵们在回答着。
    镰刀映着夕阳，放出朵朵金光，那是军民友谊的光辉，那是丰收的光芒。
