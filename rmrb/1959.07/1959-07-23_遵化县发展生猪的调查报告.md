Completed the Hog Raising Target of the National Agricultural Development Program Ahead of Schedule

Zunhua County, Hebei Province, has 75% of its land area as mountains and hills, with abundant mountain forests, fruit trees, and natural pastures, making it suitable for the development of animal husbandry. Farmers have traditionally had the habit of raising pigs. After liberation, the Communist Party organizations at all levels in Zunhua County, while focusing on agricultural production, attached great importance to the development of hog raising. They timely proposed correct guidelines and policies, closely relied on the masses, overcame various difficulties, and achieved great success in the hog raising industry. The number of pigs in the county was 228,863 in 1955, increased to 265,505 in 1956, and further to 408,380 in 1957. After collectivization in 1957, this represented a 78% increase compared to 1955 before collectivization, and a 101% increase compared to 1952, the year with the highest number of pigs in history, reaching an average of 4.7 pigs per household, basically achieving the goal of "one pig per person." Among the county's 50 townships, 19 became "10,000-pig townships" and two became "double 10,000-pig townships." After the establishment of people's communes in 1958, the Zunhua County Committee of the Communist Party of China, in view of the already developed mass hog raising and the requirements of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, proposed the establishment of pig farms in every commune and team, and vigorously developed collective hog raising. By the end of 1958, collective hog raising reached 87,061 heads. At the same time, the county committee also paid attention to the development of individual hog raising by commune members, proposing a policy of equal emphasis on collective and individual hog raising. Due to the proper handling of the relationship between the public and private sectors and the timely resolution of the ideological concerns of commune members in the early stages of communization, both commune-run and member-run hog raising developed. By the end of 1958, the number of pigs in the county had increased to 611,342, an increase of 50% over 1957, and hog raising households accounted for 97.5% of the total number of agricultural households, completing the hog raising target of the National Agricultural Development Program nine years ahead of schedule, and successfully achieving the provincial party committee's requirement of "one pig per two mu of land."

Guaranteed Increased Grain Production, Increased Commune Member Income, and Gradually Resolved the Meat Supply Problem

In recent years, Zunhua County has developed its hog raising industry, and the amount of fertilizer applied in the county has increased significantly every year, which has strongly guaranteed increased grain production. The relationship between hog raising, fertilizer application, and grain yield is shown in the following table: (Attached chart)

From the above table, it can be seen that the increase in fertilizer application is directly proportional to the increase in the number of pigs, and the increase in grain yield is also closely related to the increase in fertilizer application, thus proving the validity of the agricultural proverb "Pigs are a treasure to farmers, manure is gold in the fields; raising pigs may not make you rich, but look back at your fields."

The fact that Zunhua County has significantly increased grain production by developing hog raising also refutes the view that "there is not enough grain to eat if too many pigs are raised." By developing hog raising, Zunhua County not only has enough grain to eat but also provides pig feed, and the surplus grain has also increased year by year. In 1957, the number of pigs in the county increased nearly doubled compared to 1953, and the amount of surplus grain also increased by about one-fold. In 1958, the number of pigs increased nearly two-fold compared to 1953, and the amount of surplus grain also increased by nearly two-fold. The growth rate of surplus grain is shown in the following table: (Attached chart)

Note: Calculated according to the grain year

Hog raising not only occupies an important position in grain production increase measures, but it is also a source of increasing commune members' income. According to a survey in the Ping'an Cheng Commune of Zunhua County, in semi-mountainous areas, income from hog raising accounts for 10% of the total income of commune members, and 40%-50% of the income from sideline occupations; in plain areas, income from hog raising accounts for 15% of the total income of commune members, and 60%-70% of the income from sideline occupations. According to a survey of the Xidongmenzhuang production team in Ping'an Cheng in 1957, the total income of 14 households in the first team was 6,194 yuan, the income from household sideline occupations was 1,104 yuan, and the income from hog raising and fertilizer accumulation was 781 yuan (an average of 55.8 yuan per household, accounting for about 12.6% of the total income and 70.7% of the sideline income). The total income of 21 households in the second team was 8,777 yuan, the income from household sideline occupations was 2,021 yuan, and the income from hog raising and fertilizer accumulation was 1,304 yuan (an average of 62 yuan per household, accounting for about 14.9% of the total income and 64% of the sideline income). In particular, the income from fertilizer accumulation accounts for 40% of the total hog raising income of commune members. This has greatly solved the problem of commune members' pocket money. For example, Yan Zenrui, a commune member of Xizhuang in Jiming Village, had a fertilizer valuation income of 120 yuan in 1958. His daughter-in-law said, "This year, the money from pig manure alone is enough for us to use." Liu Jingtai, a feeder in Beigou, had a fertilizer valuation income of 200 yuan in 1958. His family of eight people only had him, an old and weak laborer, as a source of income. He relies on raising more pigs to accumulate fertilizer to solve the problem of pocket money. He said, "My family has many people, and only I, the old man, work. It doesn't matter how many work points I earn. Raising more pigs means that the money from fertilizer alone is enough to use."

Organizing the vast number of commune members to raise pigs in Zunhua County not only guaranteed the annual growth of grain production and the continuous increase of commune members' income during the cooperative period, but also achieved great success in guaranteeing the supply of meat to urban and rural areas.

Equal Emphasis on Collective and Member Feeding is an Economical Way to Raise Pigs Quickly, Well, and Economically

According to the survey, Zunhua County purchased 53,033 heads of pigs in 1956, transferred 47,550 heads to higher levels, and sold 5,483 heads itself. In 1957, it purchased 48,937 heads, transferred 38,022 heads to higher levels, and sold 10,915 heads itself. In 1958, it purchased 61,388 heads, transferred 48,461 heads to higher levels, and sold 12,927 heads itself. The above figures for pig purchases and transfers to higher levels illustrate the importance of hog raising in solving the meat needs of urban and rural people and in improving the lives of commune members.

Last autumn, farmers were busy with autumn harvesting and planting, running iron and steel mills on a large scale, and engaging in diversified operations. Labor was tight for a while, and the hog raising industry was affected to some extent. The Zunhua County Committee of the Communist Party of China took effective measures in a timely manner to ensure the development of the hog raising industry.

First, widespread and in-depth propaganda was carried out to mobilize the masses to debate issues such as whether or not to raise pigs, how to raise pigs, and whether or not commune members should be allowed to raise pigs. Through debates, it was clarified that hog raising must adhere to the principle of "walking on two legs," with equal emphasis on collective and member feeding. The party's guidelines and policies were explained, and it was made clear that the income from member-raised pigs was the personal property of commune members, which dispelled the concerns of commune members. In order to encourage the enthusiasm of commune members for raising pigs, reasonable prices were set for fertilizer, and 30% of the fertilizer price for 1958 was immediately returned; for pig manure in 1959, cash was given according to quality and grade. Commune members also established an evaluation committee to reasonably price pigs that commune members were unable to feed and were willing to return to the commune, and paid cash immediately, with the minimum payment being 80% at the time.

Second, the commune gave care and assistance to commune members in terms of feed for raising pigs, stipulating that each household would receive feed for two pigs (300 jin for sows, 350 jin for boars, and 120 jin for grown pigs). Commune members were also allowed to take the grain saved from the canteen home to feed the pigs.

Third, a certain amount of labor time was arranged for commune members to raise pigs. Pig-raising households were given appropriate consideration in the planning of subsidized labor; production teams also uniformly planned and arranged suitable herders to graze pigs uniformly for commune members, charging a grazing fee of 1.5 to 2 yuan per pig per year (with slight differences for sows and grown pigs).

In addition, commune members were also given pig-raising loans or piglets on credit, which were to be repaid after the pigs were raised and sold. According to recent statistics, the total amount of loans in the county has reached 189,000 yuan. Mutual loans were also organized among commune members. Nine hog raising mutual aid groups were established in Fanjialing Village (with a total of 98 households in the village), with households adjusting piglets and lending cash to each other.

Fourth, leadership was strengthened, with the secretary taking the lead, dividing the battle lines at each level, and establishing institutions (the Pig Raising Guidance Committee). Each commune was managed by a deputy director, with one or two people doing specific work. Hog raising teams were established in every village, with branches for feeding, feed processing, and epidemic prevention. It was ensured that there were people in charge at every level and that there were plans at every level. Secretaries at all levels also cultivated hog raising experimental plots.

The Zunhua County Committee's adoption of the above measures to develop commune member hog raising greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of commune members for raising pigs.

At the same time, a hierarchical management method was adopted for collective hog raising. It was determined that large-scale breeding farms and fine breed breeding farms would be managed by the commune, focusing on improving breeds and breeding to ensure the external transfer and supply of piglets to production teams and canteens. Funds, labor, and feed were uniformly arranged by the commune, and organizational management and technical guidance were strengthened. The pig farms of each production team and small team were managed by themselves, self-breeding and self-raising, focusing on fattening. After fattening, all the pigs were sold, first to ensure the completion of the state procurement tasks, and the surplus was disposed of by themselves, with the income belonging to the team. The purpose of canteen hog raising was mainly to improve life, self-raising and self-eating, and the commune did not assign tasks, but should strive to be self-sufficient with a surplus. The source of funds was mainly from commune member investment, which was repaid after fattening and slaughtering.

Many communes have also formulated production responsibility systems and incentive measures for collective hog raising. For example, the Fujiacheng pig farm divides the entire farm into groups for feed processing, pig feed collection, and feeding management, with dedicated personnel in charge. The Zhangzhuangzi management area of the Baozidian Minsheng Commune implemented a "seven-fix" (fixed labor, fixed feed, fixed breeding, fixed fattening, fixed expenses, fixed firewood, fixed epidemic prevention) responsibility system, and determined wage levels according to the number of sows and grown pigs managed. It was also stipulated that three workdays would be awarded for each additional piglet, and five cents would be awarded for each additional jin of fat pig. Penalties were given for failure to complete the task, etc.

Although Zunhua County has established many collective pig farms at present, due to the large amount and wide range of agricultural fertilizer usage, it is not advisable to concentrate pig feeding too much. Relying solely on collective pig raising cannot meet the needs of developing agricultural production and supplying meat to urban and rural people, nor can it meet the requirements of the vast number of commune members for pocket money. Therefore, collective pig raising cannot completely replace commune member pig raising at present. According to statistics, before communization, there were 28,241 collectively raised pigs in Zunhua County, accounting for 19% of the total number of pigs in the county. After communization, although the number of collectively raised pigs increased to 87,061, it still only accounted for 14% of the total number of pigs. Moreover, practice has proven that developing commune member pig raising and entrusting 80% to 90% of the pigs to contracting units and commune members for feeding is the most economical way to develop the pig raising industry quickly, well, and economically, making "a thousand-jin burden carried by everyone." For example, Jianming Commune plans to increase the number of pigs from the existing 20,003 (as of the end of February) to 30,000 (striving for 60,000) in 1959. However, the current collective pig farms only have 789 pigsties, raising 3,650 pigs, with an average of 4.7 pigs per sty, which is already very crowded. If all 30,000 pigs were contracted, at least 8,600 sties would be needed, with an average cost of 20 yuan per sty (including labor and materials), totaling 172,000 yuan. About 1,000 feeders are needed to feed these pigs, while the current collective pig farms only have 280 people. If commune members raise the pigs, the pigsties and other equipment are readily available, and there are also many auxiliary labor forces (an average of about 0.6 auxiliary labor forces per household, totaling 2,036 in the commune) that can be used. In addition to being able to participate in some auxiliary labor, the rest cannot participate in agricultural work, but they can feed pigs and also have pig raising experience and habits. Therefore, developing commune member pig raising and mobilizing their enthusiasm has a positive effect on developing agricultural production and improving the living standards of commune members.

In order to make full use of the existing pig raising conditions of commune members, Zunhua County has adopted a method of public ownership and private raising while developing commune member private ownership and private raising. Public ownership and private raising can solve the problems encountered in collective pig raising, such as too many pigs and too few sties, and too much labor occupation, and can free up part of the funds of the commune or production team to develop other production.

After the establishment of rural people's communes, the Party organization in Zunhua County, Hebei Province, carried forward the past experience of organizing the masses to raise pigs, correctly handled the relationship between the public and private sectors, promptly adopted effective measures and the working method of the mass line, and implemented the policy of equal emphasis on public raising and private raising, walking on two legs, so that the number of pigs in the county increased rapidly. Zunhua County has rich experience in mobilizing the masses to raise pigs. We have only compiled a part of it from many investigation materials for your reference, which is of practical significance to the current rural pig raising industry.

    遵化县发展生猪的调查报告

    提前完成了农业发展纲要的养猪指标
    河北省遵化县，75％的土地面积是山地和丘陵，山林果树和天然牧场很多，适于畜牧业的发展。农民历来有养猪的习惯。解放后，遵化县各级中共党组织，在大抓农业生产的同时，对发展养猪事业极其重视。他们适时地提出正确的方针政策，紧紧地依靠群众，战胜了各种困难，在养猪事业中，取得了很大成绩。全县养猪头数，1955年为二十二万八千八百六十三头，1956年增加到二十六万五千五百零五头，1957年增加到四十万八千三百八十头。1957年合作化以后，比合作化前的1955年增长78％，比历史上养猪最多的1952年增长101％，达到平均每户四点七头，基本上实现了一人一口猪的计划。在全县五十个乡中，出现了十九个万猪乡，两个双万猪乡。1958年人民公社化以后，中共遵化县委会鉴于全县群众性的养猪事业已经发展起来，和工农业大跃进的要求，又提出社社队队建立养猪场，大力发展集体养猪。到1958年年底，集体养猪达到八万七千零六十一头。同时，县委也注意发展社员个人养猪，提出集体养猪和社员养猪并重的方针。由于正确处理了公私关系，及时解决了在公社化初期社员养猪的思想顾虑，使公社养猪和社员养猪都得到发展。到1958年年底，全县生猪发展到六十一万一千三百四十二头，比1957年增长50％，全县养猪农户占总农户的97.5％，提前九年完成了全国农业发展纲要的养猪指标，胜利地实现了省委提出的二亩地一口猪的要求。
    保证了粮食增产，增加了社员收入，逐步解决肉食供应问题
    遵化县几年来发展了养猪事业，全县的施肥量每年都有很大增长，有力地保证了粮食增产。养猪施肥与粮食产量增长情况如下表：（附图表）
    从上表可以看出，施肥量的增长同生猪头数的增长是成正比例的，而粮食产量也同施肥量的增长是有密切联系的，因而证明了“猪是农家宝，粪是地里金，养猪不赚钱，回头望望田”的农谚是有道理的。
    遵化县发展养猪，粮食显著增产的事实，也驳倒了那些认为“猪养多了粮食不够吃”的看法。发展养猪，遵化县不仅粮食够吃，并且提供了猪饲料，余粮也是逐年增加的。该县1957年生猪头数比1953年增加近一倍，余粮数也增加一倍左右。1958年生猪头数比1953年增加近二倍，余粮数也增加近二倍。余粮增长速度如下表：（附图表）
    注：按粮食年度计算
    养猪不仅在粮食增产措施中占着重要地位，同时也是增加社员收入的一个来源。据在遵化县平安城公社调查，在半山区，养猪收入占社员总收入的10％，占社员副业收入的40％—50％；在平原区，养猪收入占社员总收入的15％，占社员副业收入的60％—70％。据1957年在平安城西东门庄两个生产队调查；第一队十四户总收入六千一百九十四元，家庭副业收入一千一百零四元，养猪积肥收入七百八十一元（平均每户五十五点八元，约占总收入12.6％，占副业收入70.7％），第二队二十一户，总收入八千七百七十七元，家庭副业收入二千零二十一元，养猪积肥收入一千三百零四元（平均每户六十二元，约占总收入14.9％，占副业收入64％），特别是积肥收入占社员整个养猪收入的40％。这就大大解决了社员零用钱问题。如鸡鸣村西庄社员延增瑞，1958年粪肥折价收入一百二十元，他的儿媳说：“今年仅猪粪钱就够我们用了”。北沟饲养员刘景太1958年积肥折价收入二百元，全家八口人，只有他一个年老体弱的劳力，零花钱依靠多养猪积肥来解决，他说：“我家人口多，只有我这个老头子干活，挣分多少问题不大，多养猪光粪肥钱就够用的”。
    遵化县组织广大社员养猪，不仅在合作化时期保证了全县粮食产量逐年增长，社员收入不断增加，并在保证城乡肉食供应方面获得了很大成绩。
    集体喂养和社员喂养并重，是多快好省的养猪办法
    据调查，遵化县1956年生猪收购五万三千零三十三头，上调四万七千五百五十头，自销五千四百八十三头，1957年收购四万八千九百三十七头，上调三万八千零二十二头，自销一万零九百十五头，1958年收购六万一千三百八十八头，上调四万八千四百六十一头，自销一万二千九百二十七头。以上生猪收购和上调数字就说明了养猪对解决城乡人民肉食需要及对改善社员生活的重要性。
    去年秋天，农民因忙于秋收秋种，大办钢铁，搞多种经营，劳动力一时紧张，养猪业在一定程度上受到影响，中共遵化县委及时采取了有效措施，保证了养猪业的发展。
    首先是普遍深入地进行宣传，发动群众辩论，如建明公社对要不要养猪、怎样养猪、应不应该允许社员养猪等问题展开辩论。通过辩论明确了养猪必须坚持两条腿走路，集体喂养和社员喂养并重，讲明党的方针政策，并明确规定社员养猪收入是社员个人财产，解除了社员的顾虑。为了鼓励社员养猪的积极性，对粪肥进行了合理作价，并对1958年的粪价立即归还30％；对1959年的猪粪，按质分等，给以现金。社员还成立了评价委员会，对社员无力喂养愿意归社的猪，合理作价，付给现款，最少的当时也付给现款80％。
    其次，社员养猪在饲料上公社给以照顾和帮助，规定每户发两口猪的料（母猪按三百斤，公猪按三百五十斤；成猪按一百二十斤发给）。并允许社员把食堂节约的粮食拿回家去喂猪。
    第三，对社员养猪的劳动时间，给以一定的安排。在规划补助劳动力上，适当照顾养猪户；生产队并统一规划安排好适宜的放牧人员，代社员统一放猪，每头猪每年收放猪费一元五到二元（母猪、成猪稍有差别）。
    此外，并发给社员以养猪贷款或赊给仔猪，待猪养成卖掉后再归还。据最近几个月的统计，全县贷款已达十八万九千元。在社员之间还组织互相借款。范家岭村成立了九个养猪互助小组（全村共九十八户），各户间相互调剂小猪和相互借贷现款。
    第四，加强了领导，由书记挂帅，层层划分战线，建立机构（养猪指导委员会）。各社由一名副主任专管，一、二人做具体工作。村村建立养猪小组，下设饲养、饲料加工、防疫等股。做到层层有人专管，层层有计划。各级书记并搞养猪试验田。
    县委对发展社员养猪采取了上述措施后，大大鼓励了社员养猪的积极性。
    同时，对集体养猪采取了分级管理的办法，确定大型繁殖场及良种繁育场由公社管理，以改良品种繁育为主，保证外调和供应生产队、食堂的仔猪，资金、劳力、饲料由公社统一安排，并加强组织管理和技术指导。各生产队和小队的猪场归自己管理，自繁自养，以育肥为主。育肥后全部出售，首先保证完成国家收购任务，多余的自行处理，收入归队所有。食堂养猪，主要是改善生活，自养自食，社不分配任务，但应争取自给有余。资金来源主要是靠社员投资，育肥屠宰后偿还。
    许多公社对于集体养猪还制定了生产责任制和奖励办法。如付家城猪场，把全场分为饲料加工、采猪食、饲养管理等组，专人专责。堡子店民升公社张庄子管理区实行了“七定”（定工、定料、定繁殖、定育肥、定开支、定烧柴、定防疫）责任制，并按管理母猪和成猪的头数确定工资级别，还规定了每增加一个仔猪奖给三个劳动日，肥猪每增加一斤，奖励五分钱，没有完成任务的给予一定处罚等奖惩制度。
    遵化县目前虽然已建立了不少集体养猪场。但是，由于农业用肥量大、面广，生猪喂养不宜过多集中，单靠集体养猪，是不能满足发展农业生产的需要和城乡人民肉食供应任务的，也不能满足广大社员零用钱的要求。因此，目前集体养猪还不能完全代替社员养猪。据统计，公社化以前，遵化县集体养猪二万八千二百四十一头，占全县生猪总头数的19％。公社化后集体养猪虽然增加到八万七千零六十一头，但是也只占生猪总头数的14％。而且实践证明，发展社员养猪，把80％到90％的猪交给承包单位和社员饲养，这样就使“千斤担子众人挑”，对发展养猪事业是多快好省的最经济的办法。如建明公社计划1959年在现有二万零三头（2月底）的基础上发展到三万头（争取六万头）。但是，目前集体养猪场只有七百八十九个猪圈，养了三千六百五十头，平均每圈四点七只，已是很拥挤了，如果把三万头猪全包下来，至少需八千六百个圈，平均每个圈成本二十元（包括工和料），共需资金十七万二千元。饲养这些猪共需饲养员一千人左右，而现在集体养猪场只有二百八十人。如果由社员饲养，猪圈等设备是现成的，也有许多辅助劳动力（平均每户大约有零点六个辅助劳动力，全社共合二千零三十六个）可以使用。他们中除有一部分可以参加一些辅助劳动以外，其余不能参加农活，但是可以喂猪，也有养猪的经验和习惯。因此，发展社员养猪，调动他们的积极性，对发展农业生产与提高社员生活水平是有积极作用的。
    为充分利用社员现有养猪条件，遵化县在发展社员私有私养的同时，也采取了公有私养的养猪办法。公有私养，可以解决集体养猪中遇到的猪多圈少，占用劳力太多等问题，并可腾出公社或生产队的部分资金去发展其他生产。
    农村人民公社建立后，河北省遵化县党组织发扬了过去组织群众养猪经验，正确处理了公私关系，及时采取了有效措施和群众路线的工作方法，贯彻了公养和私养并重，两条腿走路的方针，使全县生猪头数得到迅速增长。遵化县发动群众养猪经验是很丰富的，我们只是从许多调查材料中整理出一部分，供大家参考，这对当前农村养猪事业是有现实意义的。
