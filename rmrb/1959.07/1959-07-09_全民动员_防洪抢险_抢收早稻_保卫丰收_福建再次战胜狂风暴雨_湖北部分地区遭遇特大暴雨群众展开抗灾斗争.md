Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, July 8th: Following their victory over torrential rains and mountain floods in mid-June, the people of Fujian Province, led by the Party and government, have once again overcome the onslaught of gales and torrential rain in recent days.

From the afternoon of July 5th to the evening of July 7th, Fujian was hit by strong winds and torrential rain from south to north due to the impact of a tropical storm from the South China Sea. The coastal areas of southern Fujian were hit particularly hard, with winds reaching levels five to ten and continuous rainfall of around 200 millimeters in over fifty hours. Other parts of the province also experienced strong winds of levels four and five and torrential rain of around 100 millimeters. The water levels of the Jiulong River, Jin River, Mulan Creek, Min River, and Ao River systems continued to rise, exceeding the warning levels successively.

In order to overcome the gales and torrential rain, safeguard the summer harvest, and protect the safety of residents' lives and property, Party, government, military, and civilian forces at all levels, upon receiving notices and alerts from higher authorities, were urgently mobilized under the unified leadership of the local Party committees before the arrival of the gales and torrential rain to patrol and reinforce dikes, and rush to harvest and transport early rice, thereby greatly reducing losses. In southern Fujian, which suffered more severely, after local leading departments organized more than 100,000 urban and rural residents, cadres, and officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to fight day and night against gales and torrential rain to carry out flood prevention and disaster relief, apart from the flooding of more than 185,000 mu of early rice, peanuts, and other crops, which suffered varying degrees of damage such as lodging and loss, other losses were not significant. Jinjiang, Longyan, and other areas where early rice was gradually ripening, generally suffered very little damage after timely organization of forces for flood prevention and rush harvesting. In Putian County, over 1,000 mu of early rice that had been flooded were all rushed and harvested home, including both grain and straw, before the floodwaters entered the paddy fields thanks to the people's courageous fight against the rain.

Now, as the center of the torrential rain gradually moves northward, Party, government, military, and civilian forces throughout the province are continuing to be vigilant, strengthening the maintenance of water conservancy projects and wind and flood prevention work to prevent summer storms, while organizing forces to rush harvest mature early rice in the rain and carrying out processing and fertilization of flooded farmland to ensure the normal growth of submerged crops.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 8th: Parts of Hubei Province on both sides of the Yangtze and Han Rivers have once again been hit by extreme rainstorms. Cadres and the masses in these areas are currently launching a tenacious struggle under the leadership of Party committees at all levels.

In early June, Huangpi, Echeng, Hanchuan, Hanyang, Wuhan and other places close to the Yangtze and Han Rivers encountered a rare rainstorm of the past decades. By the end of June, these areas were hit by rainstorms for the second time. The rainfall in counties such as Huanggang and Xishui exceeded 300 millimeters in two days, which was almost doubled compared with the first time. Due to the heavy rainfall, some places became a vast expanse of water in a few hours. According to incomplete statistics, about 500,000 mu of farmland in counties such as Xishui were flooded.

Cadres and the masses in these areas launched a disaster relief struggle in the pouring rain. Farmers and cadres in counties such as Xinzhou and Macheng cleared ditches and drained waterlogged fields in the rain, preventing floods and rushing to rescue, striving to reduce crop losses. After the heavy rain, they immediately launched a struggle to fight floods, drain waterlogged fields, replant and ensure the harvest, competing with the waterlogged fields and struggling for grain and cotton with the disaster. After several days of hard work, most of the flooded farmland has been drained. The seedlings that were hit by heavy rain again have mostly turned from yellow to green after careful care by the masses. In some communes in Huanggang, Echeng, and other counties, after washing and supporting the seedlings, they also sprayed a lime-sulfur mixture on cotton, jute, and other crops to prevent diseases and insect pests. For some of the more severely affected crops, various localities have actively changed to planting miscellaneous grains in accordance with the principle of adapting to local conditions. In Huangzhou Commune, Huanggang County, more than 12,000 mu of rice and cotton were flooded and died, and now they have all been planted with sweet potatoes, millet, radishes, etc. Echeng County, which was more severely affected, recently opened up more than 18,000 mu of wasteland, preparing to expand the planting area. Commune members said: "Sweet potatoes are all over the hills, melons and vegetables are all over the villages, and miscellaneous grains are planted everywhere, we must have a great harvest after the disaster."

    全民动员　防洪抢险　抢收早稻　保卫丰收
    福建再次战胜狂风暴雨
    湖北部分地区遭遇特大暴雨群众展开抗灾斗争
    新华社福州8日电　福建省各地党政军民继6月中旬战胜暴雨和山洪灾害之后，连日来又一次战胜了狂风暴雨的侵袭。
    从5日下午开始到7日傍晚止，福建各地由于受到来自南海的热带风暴的影响，由南到北连日遭到大风和暴雨袭击，其中受影响较大的闽南沿海地区风力达五级到十级，五十多个小时内连续下雨二百毫米左右。全省其他地区也都遭受四、五级大风和一百毫米左右的暴雨侵袭。九龙江、晋江、木兰溪、闽江、鳌江等河系水位都继续上涨，先后超过了警戒水位。
    为了战胜狂风暴雨的袭击，保卫夏季丰收和居民生命财产的安全，各地党政军民在一接到上级的通知和警报以后，都在当地党委的统一领导下，在狂风暴雨到来前紧急动员起来，上堤巡逻抢险，抢割抢运早稻，从而大大减少了损失。受害较大的闽南地区，经过当地领导部门组织十多万城乡居民、干部和中国人民解放军官兵日夜和狂风暴雨搏斗进行防洪抢险以后，除了受淹十八万五千多亩早稻、花生等作物遭到倒伏、流失等不同程度的损失以外，其它损失都不很大。早稻逐渐黄熟的晋江、龙岩等地区，在经过及时组织力量防洪抢收以后，一般损失都很轻微。莆田县原来受淹的一千多亩早稻，经过群众冒雨奋战，在洪水没有进入稻田之前，就连稻谷和稻草都全部抢割抢收回家。
    现在随着暴雨中心逐步北移，全省各地党政军民正一面继续提高警惕，加强培修水利工程和防风防洪工作，预防夏季暴风雨的袭击，一面组织力量冒雨抢收已经成熟的早稻，同时对受淹的农田进行加工加肥，以保证受淹作物的正常生长。
    新华社武汉8日电　湖北省长江、汉水两岸部分地区又一次遭到了特大暴雨的袭击。这些地区的干部和群众，目前正在各级党委的领导下，展开顽强的斗争。
    6月上旬，紧靠长江、汉水两岸的黄陂、鄂城、汉川、汉阳和武汉市等地曾遇到一场几十年来稀有的暴风雨。到6月底，这些地区又第二次遭到了暴雨袭击，黄冈、浠水等县两天内就降雨三百多毫米，比第一次几乎增大一倍。由于雨势太猛，有的地方几个钟头就成一片汪洋。据不完全统计，浠水等县约有五十多万亩农田被淹。
    这些地区的干部和群众，在滂沱大雨中就展开了抗灾斗争。新洲、麻城等县农民跟干部一道冒雨清沟排渍，防洪抢险，力争减少庄稼损失。大雨过后，他们立即又展开了抗洪排渍、补种保收斗争，与渍水争田地，与灾害争粮棉。经过几天的奋战，目前被淹的农田大部分已排干了水，再度遭到大雨袭击的禾苗，经过群众细心料理，大都由黄转青。黄冈、鄂城等县有的公社在洗苗扶苗后，还对棉花、黄麻等作物喷散了一次石灰硫磺合剂，防止病虫害。对部分受灾较重的作物，各地都根据因地制宜的原则，积极改种杂粮。黄冈县黄州公社有一万二千多亩水稻、棉花被淹死，现在都已种上了红薯、粟谷、萝卜等。受灾较重的鄂城县最近还开了一万八千多亩的荒地，准备扩大播种面积，社员们说：“红薯满山岗，瓜菜遍村庄，杂粮处处种，定要大灾大丰收”。
