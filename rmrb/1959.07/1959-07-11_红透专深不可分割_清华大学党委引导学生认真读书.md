Redness and Expertise are Inseparable
Tsinghua University Party Committee Guides Students to Study Diligently

(Our report) The Tsinghua University Party Committee has greatly improved the students' enthusiasm for learning by using thorough and meticulous ideological work to guide students to be both red and expert.

Currently, all over 10,000 students in the school are studying according to the teaching plan and working according to the production plan. Generally, each person has fifty to sixty hours per week for attending classes and self-study. Appropriate time is allocated for physical exercise, social work, cultural entertainment, and reading newspapers. The atmosphere of studying hard, thinking independently, engaging in free debate, and proceeding in an orderly manner is becoming stronger. In the morning, students reciting Russian can be seen everywhere on campus. During self-study, many people go to the library, study hall, and dormitory to read books and do exercises, and read reference books according to their own choices. The number of designated reference books borrowed from the library in May increased sixfold compared to January. Some students in the third year and above are also directly reading foreign language reference books, and some have subscribed to foreign technical journals themselves. In the evening, after everyone returns to the dormitory, they exchange the problems they have been thinking about during the day. Some students even post the problems they have thought about in the corridor to solicit opponents for debate. When students in the second year of the Metallography and Heat Treatment Department of the Mechanical Engineering Department were doing a chemistry problem, they came up with three correct solutions after free discussion, which made everyone learn more deeply.

A few students at Tsinghua University, after the vigorous political movements, clarified the importance of being "red," but at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, some neglected the idea of being "expert," did not grasp learning tightly, and were not diligent enough. Some student cadres were afraid that emphasizing learning would lead to a tendency to neglect politics, so they put too much time on social work and various extracurricular activities, and lacked sufficient attention to learning.

The Tsinghua University Party Committee analyzed these situations and decided to carry out positive ideological education to guide students to comprehensively treat "redness" and "expertise" and improve their enthusiasm for learning. The decision was made for cadres to take the lead in learning, adopt several measures to control various activities, adhere to and establish necessary rules and regulations, and improve working methods.

At the end of last year, the Tsinghua University Party Committee, combined with the school's summary of the experience of combining education with productive labor, organized students to discuss issues such as the school's training goals and the relationship between theory and practice, helping students to see the gains of productive labor while correctly recognizing the indispensability of books and theoretical knowledge. Since April this year, the Party Committee has repeatedly explained to students in various reports that "redness and expertise" are inseparable, and that students should demand more of themselves, with each person using both shoulders to carry the two burdens of "redness" and "expertise." When carrying out education, the Party Committee also paid attention to conducting different work for different people. For the majority of students, in addition to theoretically improving their understanding, they were also told how to take concrete actions, explaining to them that as long as they adhere to the direction of being both "red" and "expert," actively respond to the Party's various calls, conscientiously study political theory courses, and participate in productive labor, they will become both "red" and "expert" by studying hard under these conditions. In addition to helping them correctly understand the relationship between "redness" and "expertise," a group of student cadres were also primarily helped to understand the current political and ideological situation of students in the school, eliminating their concerns that "emphasizing learning would lead to a tendency to neglect politics."

While solving the ideological problems of various people, the Tsinghua University Party Committee paid attention to setting up examples to guide the broad masses of students forward. After the school's Red and Expert Debate last year on "July 1st," the Party Committee commended six outstanding students from the graduating class who were both "red" and "expert." When conducting a comprehensive summary of teaching and productive labor at the beginning of this year, teachers and students with significant achievements in learning and productive labor were also commended. Recently, special attention has been paid to encouraging cadres to take the lead in demonstrating learning.

More importantly, the members of the Standing Committee of the Tsinghua University Party Committee and the Communist Youth League Committee themselves set an example by studying their professions assiduously. The Party Committee of this school had paid attention to studying their professions in the past, but some people stopped for a while during the movement. This year, the Party Committee has made comprehensive arrangements again. Now, the 18 members of the Standing Committee of the Party Committee have each taken on teaching or scientific research work in political theory and science and technology based on their original foundations. Combined with teaching and scientific research work, they each have specific study plans. The main cadres of the Communist Youth League Committee are all graduates of various majors in this school. Therefore, in addition to undertaking political work, they also hold concurrent positions in the teaching and scientific research of one course. These actions of the leading cadres vigorously motivated the teachers and students of the whole school, making everyone feel the importance of studying their professions from their actions, and forming an atmosphere of reading and studying their professions. Secondly, in the arrangement of specific work, because the leading cadres of the Party Committee put teaching work in the central position, some work that could be done or not done was reduced.

While solving a series of ideological understanding problems, the Tsinghua University Party Committee also adopted several measures aimed at the main problems of each stage. After the mass production movement at the end of last year, activities other than learning began to be controlled. In early April this year, the time for students' weekly study, social activities, physical exercise, sleep, and free activities was specifically stipulated. The Academic Affairs Office also universally inspected the implementation of the teaching plans of various departments and majors at the end of last year, stipulating several disciplines for teaching work, emphasizing that all teaching links should be completed according to the teaching plan and should not be reduced or changed casually. Students' requests for leave, suspension, and withdrawal should be carried out according to the prescribed system. The teaching system of examinations and assessments was adhered to. Some classes used the methods of political movements and production movements to organize collective learning when strengthening learning, which affected individual study. After the Party Committee discovered this, it immediately persuaded and stopped it, and summarized the experience of learning according to the characteristics of learning in the Mechanical Engineering Department and promoted it throughout the school. In various courses, it is advocated to listen to lectures and read books carefully, select reference books according to each person's specific conditions, and on this basis,展开free debate. Students with learning difficulties should help each other appropriately. (Zhu Bin) (Attached photo)

    红透专深不可分割
    清华大学党委引导学生认真读书
    本报讯　清华大学党委以深入细致的思想工作引导学生又红又专，大大提高了学生们的学习积极性。
    现在全校一万多学生都在按教学计划读书，按教学计划劳动。一般每周每人都有五十到六十小时的时间用于上课和自习，体育锻炼、社会工作、文化娱乐、阅读报纸等活动都有适当的时间进行。学习上刻苦钻研独立思考、自由争辩、循序渐进的风气越来越浓。早晨校园里各处是念俄文的学生，自习时，许多人都按自己的选择去图书馆、自习室、宿舍看书作习题，阅读参考书。图书馆在5月份借出的指定参考书比1月份增加了六倍。三年级以上的部分学生还直接阅读外文参考书，有的自己专订了外文技术杂志。晚间大家回到宿舍后，互相交流一天思考的问题，有些学生还把自己思考过的问题贴在过道上征求辩论的对手。机械系金相热处理二年级的学生，在作一个化学习题时，经过自由讨论得出了三种正确的解法，使大家都学得更深了。
    清华大学有少数学生经过轰轰烈烈的政治运动，明确了红的重要性，而去年年底今年初有些忽视专的思想，学习上抓得不紧，也不够刻苦。一些学生干部怕强调了学习，会产生忽视政治的倾向，因而把过多的时间放在社会工作和各项课外活动上，对学习缺乏足够的重视。
    清华大学党委对这些情况作了分析，决定进行正面思想教育，引导学生全面地对待红与专，提高学习积极性。决定干部带头学习，采取若干措施控制各种活动，坚持和建立必要的规章制度，改进工作方法。
    清华大学党委在去年年底，就结合全校总结教育与生产劳动结合的经验，曾组织学生讨论了学校的培养目标、理论与实践的关系等问题，帮助学生看到生产劳动收获的同时，能正确地认识书本和理论知识的不可缺少。今年4月以来，党委在各种报告中都一再向学生反复说明又红又专、红透专深不可分割，要学生们更高地要求自己，每个人都以两个肩膀挑起红和专两副担子。党委在进行教育时，还注意分别对不同的人进行不同的工作。对多数的学生，除了从理论上提高他们的认识外，还告诉他们如何具体行动，向他们说明只要坚持又红又专的方向，积极响应党的各种号召，认真学习政治理论课，参加生产劳动，在这样的条件下好好读书，就会又红又专。对一部分学生干部除了帮助他们正确认识红专关系外，还着重帮助他们认识当前校内学生的政治思想形势，消除他们“强调学习会产生忽视政治倾向”的疑虑。
    清华大学党委在解决各种人的思想问题的同时，注意树立榜样，具体地引导广大学生前进。去年“七一”，全校红专大辩论后，党委就表扬了应届毕业生中六个突出的又红又专的学生。今年年初进行教学、生产劳动全面总结时，又表扬了学习、生产劳动有显著成绩的教师、学生。最近，特别注意抓干部带头示范学习。
    更重要的是清华大学的党委和团委的常委们自己以身作则钻研业务，这个学校的党委过去就注意钻研业务，在运动期间有些人一度停顿了，今年党委又重新作了全面安排，现在党委常委十八人，都根据自己原有的基础分别担任了政治理论和科学技术的教学或科学研究工作。结合教学和科学研究工作，他们各有具体的学习计划。团委的主要干部，都是本校各个专业的毕业生，因之他们除了担任政治工作外，也都兼任一门课的教学和科学研究工作。领导干部们的这些行动有力地带动了全校师生，使大家从他们的行动中感到钻研业务的重要，而形成读书钻研业务的风气。其次在具体工作的安排上，由于党委的领导干部把教学工作放到中心位置上了，也就减少了一些可办可不办的工作。
    清华大学党委在解决一系列的思想认识问题的同时，也针对每一阶段的主要问题，采取了若干措施。去年年底在群众性的生产运动以后，就开始控制学习以外的活动，今年4月上旬又具体地规定了学生每周的学习、社会活动、体育锻炼、睡眠和自由活动的时间，教务处也在去年底普遍检查了各系各专业的教学计划执行情况，规定了教学工作的几项纪律，强调各教学环节都要按教学计划完成，不能随便减少或变动，学生请假、休学、退学都要按规定的制度进行。坚持了考试、考查的教学制度。有些班级在加强学习时，搬用政治运动和生产运动的方法组织集体学习，影响了个人的钻研，党委发现后，立即劝说制止了，并且在机械系总结了按学习特点进行学习的经验，并在全校推广。在各种课程中提倡认真听课、认真读书、根据各人的具体条件选看参考书，在这个基础上展开自由争辩，对学习有困难的学生，适当互助。　（朱彬）（附图片）
