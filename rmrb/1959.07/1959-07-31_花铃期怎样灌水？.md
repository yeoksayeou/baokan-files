    How to Irrigate During the Flowering and Boll-Forming Period?
    The period from the flowering of cotton to the opening of the bolls is called the flowering and boll-forming period. During this stage, the temperature is high, and cotton grows and develops vigorously, requiring the largest amount of water. Especially recently, many cotton-producing areas have experienced drought, so irrigation of cotton fields should be paid more attention.
    Irrigation must have the correct method so that the water distribution is uniform, and the soil moisture and nutrients can be reasonably regulated. The furrow irrigation method is the most superior for cotton field irrigation.
    Furrow irrigation can be divided into three types in terms of irrigation form: alternate furrow irrigation, every furrow irrigation, and trickle furrow irrigation. The characteristic of alternate furrow irrigation is that the irrigation volume is small, and the impact on soil temperature is not significant. This is suitable for areas with high rainfall or large variations in rainfall. Alternate furrow irrigation is particularly suitable for the early and late stages of cotton growth, and areas with shorter growing seasons. Narrow row spacing or high groundwater levels should use alternate furrow irrigation.
    Every furrow irrigation is a method of irrigating every furrow. This is most suitable when the irrigation volume is large. Using every furrow irrigation also requires good control of the irrigation volume in order to better exert its superiority.
    The trickle furrow irrigation method used in Xinjiang cotton areas and the Yellow River irrigation area in Xinxiang, Henan, is an advanced method of furrow irrigation. Trickle furrow irrigation involves installing a tool at the inlet of the irrigation furrow that can control the flow of water entering the furrow, so that water slowly flows into the irrigation furrow after passing through.

    花铃期怎样灌水？
    棉花从开花至吐絮，称为花铃期。这一阶段气温高，棉花生长发育旺盛，需水量最大。特别最近许多棉产区出现旱象，更应当注意棉田的灌溉。
    灌溉要有正确的方法，才能使水分分布均匀，土壤水分和养分能够得到合理的调节。棉田灌溉方法以沟灌法最为优越。
    沟灌在灌水形式上又分隔沟灌，沟沟灌和细流沟灌等三种。隔沟灌溉法的特点是灌水量小，影响地温不大。这在降雨多或降雨量变化大的地区适宜采用。隔沟灌特别适合于棉花生长的早期和后期，及生长期较短的地区。窄行距或地下水位较高时，更应采用隔沟灌溉。
    沟沟灌是一沟跟一沟的灌水方法。这在灌水量大的时候最适用。采用沟沟灌法还需要很好地控制灌水量，才能更好地发挥它的优越性。
    新疆棉区和河南新乡引黄灌区应用的细流沟灌法，是目前沟灌中一种先进方法。细流沟灌是在灌水沟的进水口处安置一种能控制入沟水流量的工具，使水通过后徐徐流入灌水沟。　（白璧）
