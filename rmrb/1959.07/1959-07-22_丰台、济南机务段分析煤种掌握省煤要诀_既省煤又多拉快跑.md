The Beijing Railway Bureau's Fengtai Locomotive Depot, which has overfulfilled its transportation tasks every month this year, has been focusing on saving locomotive coal consumption on the basis of hauling more and running faster, reversing the situation of severe coal waste in January. In the five months from February to June, it used over nine thousand eight hundred tons less raw coal than the state-stipulated coal consumption. This amount of raw coal could allow a locomotive pulling three thousand two hundred tons of goods to run more than nine hundred trips on the Fengtai to Tianjin line, which is over one hundred kilometers long.

The Fengtai Locomotive Depot is one of the largest locomotive depots under the Beijing Railway Bureau. In January of this year, 69% of the running locomotives in this depot consumed more coal than the Ministry of Railways' standard. From February, the depot strengthened its leadership in coal-saving work. On the one hand, it mobilized the masses to make detailed calculations, making the vast number of workers realize the significant economic importance of saving locomotive coal. At the same time, it established and improved the locomotive coal consumption statistics system and coal-saving analysis system from the bottom up, so as to grasp the coal-saving situation in a timely manner, and analyze the reasons for coal-saving and coal-wasting of locomotives every day.

When analyzing the reasons for locomotive coal waste, the leaders of this depot identified two key problems: complex coal types and poor locomotive quality. In the past, the locomotives in this depot used a maximum of five types of coal, but now it has reached thirteen types. Due to the complexity of the coal types, stokers could not grasp the timing when burning the fire, often wasting a large amount of raw coal. In light of this situation, the depot's laboratory first used chemical analysis and burning in heating stoves to observe the length of burning time for various raw coals. Finally, the stoking instructor went to the locomotive to help the stoker operate, plugging the loopholes of coal waste caused by not being familiar with the performance of the coal types. The depot also strengthened the maintenance of locomotives to eliminate and prevent the phenomenon of locomotive heat loss, so as to maximize the use of coal's heat energy. Locomotives with poor thermal technical conditions were thoroughly repaired, and boiler cleaning equipment was added to remove boiler scale and increase boiler evaporation capacity. This alone enabled each locomotive to change from consuming twenty-six tons of excess coal to saving ten tons of coal per six thousand kilometers of operation, according to the ministry's standard. The number of coal savings rose steadily.

However, the coal-saving situation of each locomotive at that time was very unbalanced. Then, a vigorous coal-saving competition was launched, mobilizing each train crew to find their own targets, mutually link up, and exchange experiences to jointly improve technology. By the end of April, all the locomotives belonging to the depot had eliminated the phenomenon of exceeding the ministry's standard coal consumption, saving one thousand five hundred and twenty-five tons of coal in April, and the amount of coal saved rose to one thousand seven hundred and ninety-eight tons in June.

Now, the workers of this depot are brewing a coal-saving plan for the second half of the year. (Zhou Dingfang)

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, July 21st. The Jinan Locomotive Depot has deeply and persistently carried out the red flag competition for saving coal, mobilized the masses to analyze the reasons for coal waste of each locomotive one by one, and adopted measures "prescribed according to the symptoms," achieving significant results in the past six months. The coal consumption per ten thousand ton-kilometers of locomotives is two hundred and thirty-three kilograms, which is 4.1% lower than the planned target of the higher authorities, saving the state more than five thousand five hundred and sixty tons of raw coal. From July 1st to 15th, the coal consumption per ten thousand ton-kilometers was further reduced to two hundred and seven point six kilograms. At the same time, the transportation tasks were fully completed, achieving safety and punctuality.

The establishment of a system for regularly analyzing coal consumption and frequent publicity and mobilization work are one of the important reasons why this depot's coal-saving movement has been consistent for half a year. In the past, the depot's statisticians were on a day-shift system, and the coal consumption reports of the crew members took three or four days to calculate, so that the crew members could not quickly know their own coal-saving and coal-wasting situations. After establishing a system for analyzing coal-saving and coal-wasting reasons on a monthly, ten-day, and daily basis, the statisticians worked in three shifts, with someone on duty 24 hours a day. When the crew members sent in their reports, the results could be calculated at any time, and published in large-character posters and charts, commending the advanced and promoting the backward to catch up with the advanced. In order to promote competition between train teams and locomotives, the depot established a publicity group, which announced the achievements of coal saving on a daily basis, and implemented small reviews every five days, medium reviews every ten days, and large reviews every month. This greatly encouraged the workers, and every time they returned from a run, they scrambled to see if they were on the list of honor in front of the competition chart.

The in-depth work style of the cadres, often running with the workers to find and solve the key problems of locomotive coal waste, is another important reason why this depot saves a large amount of coal. Now, the party committee secretary, general branch secretary, depot director and other leading cadres all have their own "experimental fields." They also often participate in workers' meetings to jointly study ways to save coal. As soon as technicians and team captains find a locomotive wasting coal, they go to operate with the workers to find the cause of the coal waste. The "ЛЗ2135" Zhang Chunshan train crew used to waste more coal, and team captain Wang Daosheng and others followed them on four runs to specifically help them overcome the phenomenon of poor operation, and as a result, they changed from wasting coal to saving coal.

The depot also adopted the method of "three combinations" of technicians, captains, and workers to systematically overhaul locomotives and reduce water consumption to save coal. Many locomotives in this depot originally had weak ventilation and low flames, which not only wasted coal, but also affected the supply of steam and water. After researching and reducing the inner diameter of the waste steam nozzle to enhance ventilation, the workers generally reported that the fire was easier to burn. In order to reduce steam leakage, they tried to improve the processing accuracy of the "expansion ring" to increase the expansion force from three millimeters to five millimeters, and the steam leakage situation was greatly improved. In January, the average steam leakage per locomotive per hour was three hundred and twenty-seven kilograms, which was reduced to one hundred and forty-three kilograms in May, which played a significant role in saving fuel.

The Jinan Locomotive Depot, based on the characteristics that most of the crew members are newcomers, has come up with many ways to improve the workers' operating skills to ensure the safety and "punctuality" of locomotives and reduce coal consumption. Since the beginning of this year, they have mobilized more than thirty old workers to summarize their experiences and write them into written materials, and in combination with the route situation, have formulated a more complete comprehensive operating procedure for the Dezhou to Yanzhou section for workers to learn. For a long time, the depot has not only persisted in the system of crew member study meetings every morning, but also used various methods such as rotating off-the-job short-term training and on-site observation to help workers improve their ideological and professional level. In addition, they also implement economic accounting in every shift and the group keeps "housekeeping accounts," which also plays a good role in regular coal saving. (Sun Jing) (Attached picture)

    丰台、济南机务段分析煤种掌握省煤要诀
    既省煤又多拉快跑
    本报讯　今年来月月超额完成运输任务的北京铁路局丰台机务段，在多拉快跑的基础上，大抓节约机车用煤工作，扭转了1月份严重费煤的局面。在2月到6月的五个月中，比国家规定的用煤量少用了九千八百多吨原煤。这些原煤，可供一台牵引三千二百吨货物的机车，在丰台到天津一百多公里的线路上运行九百多趟。
    丰台机务段是北京铁路局最大的机务段之一。今年1月，这个段有69％的运行机车，耗煤量都超过铁道部规定标准。从2月份起，这个段加强了对节煤工作的领导，一面发动群众算细帐，使广大职工认识到节约机车用煤的重大经济意义。同时，自下而上地建立和健全了机车用煤统计制度和节煤分析制度，及时掌握节煤情况，每天分析机车节煤、费煤的原因。
    在分析机车费煤原因时，这个段的领导上找出了煤种复杂和机车质量不高两个关键问题。过去，这个段的机车上用的煤，最多五种，现在达到十三种。由于煤种复杂，司炉在焚火时，掌握不住火候，常常浪费大量原煤。根据这个情况，这个段的化验室对各种原煤，采取先经过化学分析和放在取暖炉里燃烧等方法，来观测燃火时间长短。最后，由焚火指导员到机车上帮助司炉操作，堵塞了由于不熟悉煤种性能而费煤的漏洞。这个段还加强了机车的维修工作，来消灭和防止机车失散热力的现象，以便最大限度地利用煤的热能。对热力技术状态不良的机车，彻底进行修整，并且增添洗炉设备，来清除锅炉的水锈，增加锅炉蒸发能力。仅这一项，就使每台机车在运行六千公里的路程中，按部定标准，从过去超额耗煤二十六吨改变为节煤十吨。节煤数字节节上升。
    但是，当时每台机车节煤的状况很不平衡。接着，又开展一个轰轰烈烈的节约用煤竞赛，发动各车组自找对象，相互挂钩、互相交流经验，来共同提高技术。到4月底，这个段所属的机车全部消灭了超过部定标准耗煤量的现象，4月份节煤一千五百二十五吨，6月份节煤量上升到一千七百九十八吨。
    现在，这个段的职工，正在酝酿下半年的节煤计划。（周定舫）
    本报济南21日电　济南机务段深入持久地开展节约煤炭的红旗竞赛，发动群众逐台分析机车费煤原因，“对症下药”采取措施，半年来有显著成绩。机车万吨公里的煤炭消耗量是二百三十三公斤，比上级计划指标降低4.1％，为国家节约了五千五百六十多吨原煤。7月1日至15日，万吨公里的煤炭消耗量，又降低到二百零七点六公斤。同时，全面完成了运输任务，做到了安全正点。
    建立定期分析用煤情况的制度，经常进行宣传鼓动工作，是这个段省煤运动半年如一日的重要原因之一。以往，这个段的统计人员是日勤制，乘务员消耗煤炭的报单要三、四天才能计算出来，不能使乘务员很快知道自己省煤、费煤的情况。建立按月、按旬、按日分析省煤、费煤原因的制度以后，统计人员分三班工作，二十四小时都有人值班，乘务员送来报单，随时能算出结果，用大字报、图表公布出来，表扬先进，推动落后追赶先进。为促进车队与车队、机车与机车开展竞赛，这个段成立了宣传组，按日公布节约煤炭成绩，实行五天一小评，十天一中评，一月一大评。这对工人鼓舞很大，每次跑车回来，都争着到竞赛图表前看看自己是否上了光荣榜。
    干部作风深入，经常和工人一起跑车，寻找和解决机车费煤的关键问题，是这个段节省大量煤炭的另一个重要原因。现在，党委书记、总支书记、段长等领导干部都有自己的“试验田”。他们还常常参加工人的会议，共同研究节省煤炭的办法。技术人员、车队队长一发现有机车费煤，就去同工人一起操作，寻找费煤的原因。“ЛЗ2135”张纯善机班过去比较费煤，队长王道生等人先后随他们跑车四次，具体帮助他们克服操作不良的现象，结果变费煤为省煤。
    这个段还采取技术员、队长、工人“三结合”的办法，有计划地普遍整修机车，降低耗水量，节省煤炭。这个段原来有好多机车通风弱，火焰低，不仅费煤，还影响汽水的供应。经研究缩小废汽喷口的内径，增强通风力以后，工人普遍反映火好烧了。为减少漏汽，他们就设法提高“涨圈”的加工精度，使涨力由三毫米增加到五毫米，漏汽情况大为好转。1月份，平均每台机车每小时要漏三百二十七公斤汽，5月份减少到一百四十三公斤，对节约燃料起了不小的作用。
    济南机务段根据乘务人员大部分是新手的特点，想了很多办法提高工人的操作水平，以保证机车安全“正点”，降低煤耗。今年以来，他们发动三十多名老工人总结自己的经验，写成书面材料，并且结合路线情况，制订出较为完整的德州至兖州区间的综合操作程序，供工人学习。长期来，这个段不仅一直坚持了每天早晨乘务员学习会的制度，还用轮流脱产短期训练、随车实地观察等多种方法，帮助工人提高思想和业务水平。此外，他们还班班实行经济核算，小组记“管家帐”，这对经常节约煤炭也起了良好的作用。　（孙静）（附图片）
