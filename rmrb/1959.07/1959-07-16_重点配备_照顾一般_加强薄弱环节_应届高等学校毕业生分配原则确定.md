Xinhua News Agency, 15th. The allocation of this year's college graduates has been determined by the State Planning Commission in conjunction with relevant departments, based on the needs of all parties and after repeated balancing, and an allocation plan has been formulated. Currently, the relevant central departments and provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions are conducting specific allocation and deployment work in accordance with this plan.

According to a relevant person in charge of the State Planning Commission: This summer, there are a total of 62,233 college graduates to be allocated by the state plan. However, due to the rapid development of national construction undertakings, especially since the Great Leap Forward last year, the demand for college graduates in all aspects has greatly increased, so that the situation of supply falling short of demand for college graduates this year is more prominent than in previous years. In the face of this situation, the State Planning Commission has adopted the principles of key allocation, strengthening weak links, and considering general needs for this year's graduate allocation work, based on the tasks of all parties and in combination with the number and majors of graduates.

When formulating the allocation plan, the State Planning Commission tried its best to take into account the needs of the central and local authorities, the current and long-term needs (referring to the needs of teachers and scientific research), and the key and general needs. When these aspects conflict, more consideration is given to long-term and key needs, while taking care of the urgent needs of certain weak links, and also paying attention to the appropriate allocation of various talents. This year, the allocation of engineering graduates first considered the urgent needs of production and capital construction in the steel, machine manufacturing, coal, electric power, and transportation systems, as well as higher industrial colleges and scientific and technological research; the allocation of science graduates first considered the urgent needs of teachers in higher education institutions and scientific and technological research; the allocation of agricultural science graduates focused on strengthening the allocation of specialized talents in the agricultural front according to the different characteristics of each region; the allocation of normal, medical, and other disciplines was based on the needs of education and health construction in various places, and necessary balance was made between regions.

The State Planning Commission requires that all localities, in carrying out the specific work of graduate allocation and deployment, should also adhere to the principle of "key allocation, strengthening weak links, and considering general needs," and in light of the situation of their own departments and regions, pay attention to properly arranging the relationship between current and long-term needs, and key and general needs. When the needs of production and teaching conflict, the needs of teaching should be given priority under the principle of taking both into account; when the needs of production enterprises and management organs conflict, the needs of production should be given priority. In short, it should be appropriately concentrated, and priority should be given to key areas as much as possible. At the same time, it is also required that all localities must carry out the deployment and dispatch of this year's graduates in strict accordance with the allocation plan, and do not arbitrarily change or postpone the time of deployment and dispatch.

    重点配备　照顾一般　加强薄弱环节
    应届高等学校毕业生分配原则确定
    新华社15日讯　今年暑期高等学校毕业生的分配工作，已由国家计划委员会会同有关部门，根据各方面的需要，经过反复平衡，制定了分配计划。目前中央有关部门，各省、市、自治区正根据这一计划进行具体的分配、调配工作。
    据国家计划委员会有关负责人谈：今年暑期由国家计划分配的高等学校毕业生，共有六万二千二百三十三人。但由于国家各项建设事业的迅速发展，特别是去年大跃进以来，各方面对高等学校毕业生的需要量都大大增加，以致今年高等学校毕业生供不应求的情况，要比往年更为突出。面对这一情况，国家计划委员会对今年毕业生的分配工作，是根据各方面的任务，结合毕业生的人数和专业情况，采取重点配备、加强薄弱环节和照顾一般的原则来进行。
    国家计划委员会在拟制分配计划时，对中央同地方、当前同长远（指师资和科学研究的需要）、重点同一般的需要，尽可能地予以兼顾。当这些方面发生矛盾时，较多地照顾了长远和重点的需要，同时对某些薄弱环节的紧急需要作了照顾，还注意了各种人材的适当配备问题。今年对工科毕业生的分配，首先考虑了钢铁、机器制造、煤炭、电力、交通运输系统的生产和基本建设，以及高等工业院校和科学技术研究等方面的急需；理科毕业生的分配，首先考虑了高等院校师资和科学技术研究的急需；对于农科毕业生的分配，着重注意了根据各地区不同的特点，加强农业战线方面专门人才的配备；对师范、医药等科类毕业生的分配，则根据各地教育、卫生事业建设的需要，在地区之间作了必要的平衡。
    国家计划委员会要求各地在进行毕业生分配和调配的具体工作时，也应根据“重点配备、加强薄弱环节和照顾一般”的原则，结合本部门、本地区的情况，注意妥善安排当前同长远、重点同一般需要的关系。当生产同教学的需要发生矛盾时，在兼顾的原则下，首先照顾教学的需要；当生产企业同管理机关的需要发生矛盾时，首先照顾生产的需要。总之，应当适当集中，尽可能首先照顾重点。同时，还要求各地对今年毕业生的调配派遣工作，必须切实按分配计划进行，不要随意变动或推延调配派遣的时间。（附图片）
