Listening to the Party and Listening to the Masses
Yi Huai

In carrying out all kinds of work, basic-level Party organizations must both listen to the Party and listen to the masses. Acting in accordance with the Party's principles, policies, and decisions, and reporting to higher-level Party committees when encountering problems, is called listening to the Party. Consulting with the masses on matters, and humbly listening to the opinions of the masses, is called listening to the masses. In any situation, these two things are indispensable to doing things well.

With the decisions and instructions of the higher-level Party committee, work can be carried out with a clear direction and a clear mind. We can understand what should be done and what should not be done, and we can correctly analyze and judge the various opinions and requirements of the masses, and lead the masses to advance in the correct direction. After listening to the Party, we must also listen to the masses. The Party's proposals should be handed over to the masses for discussion and deliberation, and together with the masses we should find ways to realize the Party's decisions, so that the Party's proposals can be transformed into the masses' proposals, and the decisions and instructions of the higher-level Party committee can be smoothly realized. Listening to the Party is relying on the leadership of the Party, and listening to the masses is relying on the support of the masses. Realizing the Party's decisions and carrying out various tasks are all for the purpose of developing production and for the happiness of the people. All work must be put into practice by the people, and without the support of the masses and the actions of the masses, it is impossible to do things well.

To listen to the masses, we must first believe in the masses. Believe in the wisdom of the masses, believe in the strength of the masses. "Many people are sages," more people, more ideas, greater strength. The opinions put forward by the masses, after analysis and research by the Party organization, are concentrated and implemented, and the masses will work together with one heart and go all out to complete them. After the Shanhe Brigade of Changhe Commune listened to the masses, the masses reflected that the matters discussed with us were in agreement with our wishes, and we would put in a lot of effort to do them. After discussing with the masses, they set the output targets for contracted production, and the masses said, "The targets are set by ourselves, and we will definitely work hard to achieve them." This proves that the masses' own affairs, with the masses "being the masters of their own affairs," can give play to the enthusiasm and initiative of the masses. When the Party organization listens to the masses, the people from top to bottom will be of one heart, and things can be done well.

Believing in the masses is also believing in the Party. First of all, believe that all decisions of the Party reflect the demands of the masses and represent the interests of the masses, and that the practices advocated by the Party are the summary of the practical experience of the masses. Therefore, it must be able to become the masses' own proposals and actions. In this way, we can believe that the masses will actively respond to and resolutely complete the Party's decisions and tasks. Although sometimes the proposals and practices put forward by the Party organization cannot be immediately accepted by the masses because they do not yet understand them. However, after consultation and discussion with the masses, and after propaganda and education work, it will be possible to win the support and support of the masses and achieve it. For example, some measures to increase production sometimes summarize local advanced experiences, sometimes learn from advanced experiences from other places, and sometimes adopt scientific research results. The masses may not be able to quickly accept advanced experiences from other places and scientific research results, and even local advanced experiences may not be immediately and universally recognized by everyone. There is always a distinction between the advanced and the backward among the masses, and some people may even oppose these new things based on their narrow experience. In this case, the Party organization must both listen to the opinions of the masses and educate the masses. Without consulting with the masses, things cannot be done well; if we do not persuade and educate the masses on some of their conservative ideas, and even therefore put listening to the Party and listening to the masses in opposition to each other, things will not be done well either. Sometimes, after the patient education of the Party organization, the majority of the masses still insist on different opinions. At this time, the Party organization must conduct a serious analysis. It is also possible that the decisions made by the Party organization or the instructions of the higher-level Party committee have some shortcomings that do not conform to the actual situation, then it is necessary to make revisions and supplements based on the opinions of the masses and the actual situation; and report to the higher-level Party committee for instructions, and then proceed after approval. This is the real way to listen to both the Party and the masses. Doing so will make it possible to do things more and better. The situation of the First Production Team Branch of the Shanhe Brigade of Changhe Commune is a good proof. They listened to the opinions of the masses and completed the early rice sowing task three days ahead of schedule, which is naturally an outstanding realization of the Party's decision. They listened to the opinions of the masses and postponed the harvesting of spring flowers by ten days, so that the crops matured and ensured a bumper harvest, which is also an outstanding implementation of the Party's instructions. They truly embodied the working method of the mass line of listening to the Party and listening to the masses.

    听党的话和听群众的话
    易槐
    基层党组织在进行各项工作中，既要听党的话，又要听群众的话。根据党的方针政策和决定办事，遇到问题向上级党委请示报告，这叫做听党的话。有事和群众商量，虚心听取群众意见，这叫做听群众的话。不论在什么情况下，要把事情办好，这两条缺一不可。
    有了上级党委的决定和指示，工作起来才能方向明确，头脑清醒，才能懂得什么事该做，什么事不该做，才能正确地分析和判断群众各种各样的意见和要求，领导群众向正确的方向前进。听了党的话，还要听群众的话。要把党的主张交给群众去商量去议论，和群众共同找出实现党的决定的办法，才能把党的主张变成群众的主张，顺利实现上级党委的决定和指示。听党的话是依靠党的领导，听群众的话是依靠群众的支持。实现党的决定，进行各项工作，都是为了发展生产，为了人民群众的幸福。所有的工作，都要经过人民群众去实践，没有群众的支持、群众的行动，是不可能把事情办好的。
    要听群众的话，首先要相信群众。相信群众的智慧，相信群众的力量。“众人是圣人”，人多，主意多，力量大。群众提出的意见，经过党组织的分析研究，集中起来，加以实行，群众就会同心协力，鼓足干劲去完成。长河公社山河大队，在听群众的话以后，群众就反映，和我们商量的事，口通心愿，干起来就会出一身汗。他们经过群众讨论，订好了包产指标，群众就说，“指标是我们自己订出来的，一定出力干”。这就证明，群众自己的事，由群众“当家作主”，可以发挥群众的积极性和主动性。党组织听了群众的话，上下同心，就能把事情办好。
    相信群众，也就是相信党。首先相信党的一切决定是反映群众要求、代表群众利益的，党所提倡的作法是群众实践经验的总结。因此，它就一定能够变成群众自己的主张和行动。这样，就能够相信群众对党的决定和任务会积极响应，坚决完成。虽然有时党组织所提出的主张和作法，由于群众还不理解而不能立即接受。但经过同群众商量议论，经过宣传教育工作，是会取得群众的拥护和支持而实现的。例如，某些增产措施，有时候是总结了本地的先进经验，有时候是学习了外地的先进经验，有时候又是采用了科学研究成果。外地的先进经验和科学研究成果，群众不一定能很快接受，就是本地的先进经验，也不一定能立即为大家普遍认识。群众中总有先进、落后之分，有些人甚至会根据自己的狭隘经验来反对这些新事物。在这种情况下，党组织既要听群众的意见，又要对群众进行教育。不和群众商量，办不好事情；对群众的某些保守思想不作说服教育，甚至因此把听党的话和听群众的话对立起来，这同样办不好事情。有时候，经过党组织的耐心教育，群众中的多数仍然坚持不同的意见，这时候，党组织就要认真地进行分析。也有可能，党组织作出的决定，或是上级党委的指示，有某些不合实际情况的缺点，那就需要根据群众的意见、实际的情况，作出修正和补充；并向上级党委请示报告，经过批准再办。这就是真正地既听党的话又听群众的话的作法。这样作，就有可能把事情办得更多更好。长河公社山河大队第一生产队支部的情况就是一个很好的证明。他们听取了群众意见，提前三天完成了早稻播种任务，这自然是出色地实现了党的决定。他们听取了群众的意见，推迟十天收割春花，使作物成熟，保证丰产丰收，这同样是出色地执行了党的指示。他们真正地体现了听党的话又听群众的话的群众路线的工作方法。
