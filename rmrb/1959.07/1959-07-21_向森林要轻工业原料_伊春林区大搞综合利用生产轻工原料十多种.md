From the Forest for Light Industrial Raw Materials
Yichun Forest Area Vigorously Engages in Comprehensive Utilization, Producing More Than Ten Kinds of Light Industrial Raw Materials

(Our dispatch) While overfulfilling timber production and seedling cultivation, and afforestation tasks, the Yichun Forest Area in Heilongjiang Province is vigorously engaged in the comprehensive utilization of forest resources. By the beginning of July, all forest bureaus, forest farms, and people's communes in the area had established, consolidated, and put into production 114 small and medium-sized waste material processing plants and forest chemical factories. They have produced more than 3,000 tons of more than ten kinds of forest chemical products such as rosin, tannin extract, vinegar stone, and turpentine. This figure is more than twice the total output of forest chemical products for the entire year of 1958.

For a long time, the Yichun area only engaged in single-product timber production, and the utilization of abundant forest resources was insufficient. The development of diversified operations was relatively slow. Since the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the general direction of strengthening forestry production and construction, the Party committees at all levels in the Yichun area have actively taken measures to properly arrange various tasks of timber production and diversified operations, mobilizing the masses to invest in developing mountainous resources and expanding the scope of timber utilization, thereby promoting the diversified operations and comprehensive utilization of timber in mountainous areas. According to statistics from relevant departments in Yichun City, in the first half of this year, thanks to the vigorous development of forest chemical product production and waste material and substandard material processing work throughout the area, a total of 24 kinds of products were produced.

At the beginning of the year, the Yichun Forestry Administration established a Timber Comprehensive Utilization Office to strengthen the leadership of this work. Each forest bureau and forest farm has also successively established comprehensive utilization institutions and equipped them with full-time cadres for comprehensive utilization. Each bureau has also conducted surveys on resource conditions and formulated preliminary plans for developing the mountainous economy and comprehensively utilizing forest resources. Each time timber production tasks are assigned, forest chemical product and waste material processing tasks are also assigned, and labor and production are arranged. The Fenglin Forestry Bureau, taking advantage of the good season for collecting pine resin in midsummer and when forestry work is not too busy, drew labor from various types of work to carry out resin collection production. The Party committee of this bureau also drew a member of the Party committee and deputy director to be specifically responsible for this work. As a result, forest chemical production reached a climax in a short time. At present, the number of people collecting pine resin has increased from the original 30 to 120; more than 12,000 resin receivers have been rushed to be hung in the designated logging area. According to statistics at the end of June, the amount of pine resin collected has reached more than 4,000 catties, and more than 1,000 catties of rosin have been refined.

Adhering to the principle of simplicity and making the most of local conditions, focusing on small-scale and indigenous methods, has played a huge role in promoting the comprehensive utilization of forest resources, rapidly launching the forest chemical industry, and promptly producing products to meet social needs. The equipment of the 114 forestry chemical factories that have been established in more than a dozen forest bureaus throughout the area is mostly pieced together by using substitutes or repairing waste materials. The Shangganling Forestry Bureau equipped a forest chemical factory with large iron pots and iron buckets, and has now produced seven kinds of forest chemical products such as pine root oil, turpentine, and pine needle oil.

In order to promote the comprehensive utilization of timber and the development of the forest chemical industry, the Yichun Forest Area has paid special attention to learning from advanced experiences and promoting advanced experience. For example, from last year to now, the Yichun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Yichun Forestry Administration jointly organized some Party committee secretaries, directors, and comprehensive utilization section chiefs of the forest bureaus to visit and study at 24 timber processing plants and forest chemical factories in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and other places for more than 40 days. After returning to the bureau, the experience from other places was applied to practice, effectively promoting the development of comprehensive processing work.

    向森林要轻工业原料
    伊春林区大搞综合利用生产轻工原料十多种
    本报讯　黑龙江省伊春林区在超额完成木材生产和育苗、造林任务的同时，大搞森林资源的综合利用，到7月上旬止，全区各林业局、林场和人民公社建立起来并经过整顿定型后投入生产的中小型废材加工厂和林产化学工厂即达一百一十四处，生产出松香、栲胶、醋石、松节油等十多种林化产品三千余吨，这个数字比1958年全年林化产品总产量还多两倍以上。
    长期以来，伊春地区只是进行单一的木材生产，对丰富的森林资源利用的不够，多种经营的发展较为缓慢。自从中共黑龙江省委提出加强林业生产建设总方向以后，伊春地区的各级党委积极采取措施，妥善安排木材生产和多种经营的各项工作，动员群众投入开发山区资源、扩大木材利用范围等活动，从而促进了山区的多种经营和木材的综合利用。据伊春市有关部门统计，今年上半年由于全区大搞森林化学产品生产和废材、等外材加工工作，生产出各种产品共二十四种。
    伊春林业管理局在年初就成立木材综合利用处，加强了对这项工作的领导。各林业局和林场也都相继成立了综合利用机构，并配备了综合利用的专职干部。各局还对资源状况进行调查，制订了发展山区经济、综合利用森林资源等初步规划。每次下达木材生产任务，同时也下达森林化工产品和废材加工任务，安排劳动力和组织生产。丰林林业局趁盛夏采集松脂的好季节和林业工作不太忙的时候，从各个工种抽出劳动力进行采脂的生产。这个局党委又抽出一名党委委员、副局长专门负责这一工作，结果短时间内使林化生产出现了高潮。目前采集松脂人数已由原来三十个人增加到一百二十人；在指定的伐区内共突击挂上了一万二千多个受脂器，到6月末统计，采集松脂数量已达四千余市斤，炼制松香一千余市斤。
    坚持因陋就简，小型、土法为主的方针，对促进森林资源综合利用，林产化学工业迅速上马，及时拿出产品满足社会需要起了巨大的推动作用。全区十多个林业局已建立起来的一百一十四个林业化工厂的设备，绝大部分都是靠代用或废物修复凑集起来的。上甘岭林业局用大铁锅和铁桶装备起一个林化工厂，目前已生产出松根油、松节油、松针油等七种林化产品。
    为了推动木材综合利用和林产化学工业的发展，伊春林区特别注意学习先进经验和推广先进经验工作。如去年到现在由中共伊春市委、伊春林业管理局共同组织了部分林业局党委书记、局长、综合利用科长等人，用四十多天的时间先后到北京、天津、上海、浙江等地二十四个木材加工厂和林产化学工厂参观学习。回局后将外地的经验用于实际，有效地推动了综合加工工作的开展。
