Xinhua News Agency, Moscow – On the occasion of the second anniversary of the International Geophysical Year (July 1st), the President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Nesmeyanov, Vice President Bardin, and Vice Chairman of the Soviet International Geophysical Year Committee, Branley, published articles in newspapers summarizing the significant achievements and discoveries made by Soviet scientists in geophysical research over the past two years.

Nesmeyanov stated in his article published in "Pravda" that preliminary summaries of the available materials demonstrate that the observations and research conducted over the past two years have led to several conclusions of significant theoretical and practical importance. He pointed out that the launch of artificial Earth satellites and cosmic rockets by the Soviet Union was a major event in the International Geophysical Year. These events presented vast possibilities for studying the upper atmosphere, cosmic matter, solar radiation, and more.

Nesmeyanov mentioned a highly intriguing phenomenon. He said that Soviet scientists discovered that the Earth experiences fluctuations, known as "solid tides." For example, in Moscow, the fluctuation amplitude reaches fifty to sixty centimeters within twelve hours, occurring twice in a twenty-four-hour period. Scientists are conducting in-depth investigations of this natural phenomenon. The area over which these fluctuations occur is extremely large, making them unnoticeable under normal circumstances.

Nesmeyanov stated that, based on materials obtained from satellites and rockets, the outer edge of Earth's atmosphere extends to an altitude of three thousand kilometers.

In meteorology, it was previously believed that high-altitude air currents of nine to twelve kilometers existed only over low-latitude regions. Now, according to meteorological observation data, it has been determined that these air currents exist not only in those areas but also over temperate regions, and even near the Arctic Circle. This is of significant theoretical importance for understanding the laws of atmospheric flow. Research conducted on the stratosphere has revealed that, at high altitudes, the circulation of polar cyclones and summer anticyclones can move to the equatorial regions of the Earth. This was also previously unknown. Research conducted by the Soviet Union using meteorological rockets has also concluded that, at polar latitudes, the temperature of the stratosphere drops to minus eighty to ninety degrees Celsius. However, starting from an altitude of thirty to thirty-two kilometers, the temperature begins to rise.

In the past, some people said that the Earth's magnetism originated from magnets inside the Earth, the so-called "magnet theory." Now, according to materials obtained from the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite, it has been determined that this theory is completely unfounded.

Nesmeyanov pointed out that it is known that strong disturbances in the Earth's magnetic field, known as magnetic storms, sometimes occur. During magnetic storms, radio waves are severely disrupted. It was previously believed that the cause of magnetic storms was due to changes in solar activity, but the results of Soviet scientists' research on magnetic storms have proven that magnetic storms are caused by streams of particles passing "beside" the Earth.

The International Geophysical Year coincided with the most active period of solar activity, and the level of solar observation by Soviet scientists was greatly improved.

Nesmeyanov said that in the past two years, Soviet scientists have conducted enormous research work in almost all the oceans. The Soviet Academy of Sciences' research vessel "Vityaz" conducted four long voyages in the Pacific Ocean, covering a distance of 70,000 nautical miles. The "Mikhail Lomonosov" crisscrossed the North Atlantic for 55,000 nautical miles. The research conducted by the "Ob" and "Lena" along the Antarctic coast, the Indian Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, and the southern Atlantic Ocean provided invaluable materials for science. The world's only non-magnetic research vessel, the Soviet "Zarya," discovered previously unknown geomagnetic anomalies deep in the Atlantic Ocean during its 47,000-nautical-mile voyage.

Nesmeyanov concluded by proposing that the period from 1960 to 1962 be declared a period for scientifically and practically mastering the research results of the International Geophysical Year.

Branley introduced the activities of various countries in the International Geophysical Year. In his article, he stated that over the past two years, scientists from more than sixty countries have conducted extensive research on the Earth. A total of more than three thousand meteorological observation stations in various countries have worked according to the plan of the International Geophysical Year, releasing hundreds of thousands of radiosondes and hundreds of meteorological rockets. The outstanding achievements of the Soviet Union in science and technology have helped Soviet geophysicists make outstanding contributions. The activities of the International Geophysical Year will undoubtedly bring invaluable benefits to science.

    苏联科学院长总结地球物理年研究成果
    两年观天测地　探得巨大奥秘
    新华社莫斯科讯　在国际地球物理年两周年（7月1日）之际，苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫、副院长巴尔金和苏联国际地球物理年委员会副主席布兰尼分别在报纸上发表文章，总结苏联科学家两年来在地球物理研究方面所获得的若干重大成就和发现。
    涅斯米扬诺夫在“真理报”发表的文章中说，据已有材料所作的初步总结证明，两年来的考察研究已能得出若干具有重大理论和实践意义的结论。他指出，苏联发射人造地球卫星和宇宙火箭是国际地球物理年中的重大事件。它们为研究大气高层、宇宙物质、太阳辐射等提出了巨大可能性。
    涅斯米扬诺夫提到了一个极有兴趣的现象。他说，苏联科学家发现，地球有涨落现象，号称“固体潮”。例如，莫斯科在十二小时内涨落幅度即达五十—六十公分，在一昼夜中就涨落两次。科学家正在对这种自然现象进行深入考察。这种涨落进行时的面积极大，所以人们在平时是觉察不到的。
  　涅斯米扬诺夫说，根据卫星和火箭所得到的材料可以知道，地球大气的外沿一直伸展到三千公里的高处。
    在气象学方面，过去认为，只有低纬度区域上空有九至十二公里的高空的气流。现在根据气象考察材料确定，不仅在这些地方，而且在温带地区上空，甚至在极圈附近区域的上空也存在这种气流。这对于掌握大气流动的规律有巨大的理论意义。在对平流层进行的研究中发现，在高空中，地球极地的气旋和夏季反气旋的环流可以移动到地球的赤道区域。这也是过去所不知道的。苏联用气象火箭所进行的研究还得出了这样的结论，在南北极极地纬度上，平流层的温度冷到摄氏零下八十—九十度。但是，从三十—三十二公里高空起，温度却开始上升起来。
    过去有人说地磁起源是因为地球内部有磁铁，即有所谓“磁铁理论”。现在根据苏联第三个人造卫星所得材料确定，这种理论是完全没有根据的。
    涅斯米扬诺夫指出，人们知道，地球上有时会发生磁场强烈扰动的磁暴现象，磁暴发生时，无线电波会受到严重干扰，过去认为，产生磁暴的原因，是由于太阳活动的变化，而苏联科学家对磁暴研究的结果证明，磁暴是被从地球“旁边”经过的微粒气流所引起的。
    国际地球物理年期间正是太阳活动最活跃的时期，苏联科学家对太阳观察的水平大大地提高了。
    涅斯米扬诺夫说，两年来，苏联科学家几乎在所有的海洋中进行了巨大的考察工作。苏联科学院考察船“勇士号”在太平洋进行了四次远航，航程达七万浬。“米哈伊尔·洛蒙诺索夫号”在大西洋北部辗转航行五万五千浬。“鄂毕号”和“勒拿号”在南极沿岸、印度洋、太平洋和大西洋南部海面进行的考察，为科学提供了极珍贵的材料。世界上唯一的，苏联“曙光号”非磁性考察船，在进行的四万七千浬的航行中，发现在大西洋深处有前所不知的地磁异常现象。
    涅斯米扬诺夫最后说，他提议把1960—1962年宣布为科学地、实际地掌握国际地球物理年研究成果的时期。
    布兰尼介绍了各国在国际地球物理年中的活动情况。他在文章中说，两年来，六十多个国家的科学家对地球进行了广泛的研究，各国共有三千多个气象观察站按照国际地球物理年的计划进行了工作，先后共放出了几十万个无线电探空仪和成百个气象火箭。苏联在科学技术方面的卓越成就帮助了苏联的地球物理学家作出了出色的贡献。国际地球物理年的活动无疑地将给科学带来无法估价的利益。
