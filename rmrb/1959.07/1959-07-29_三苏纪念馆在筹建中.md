    三苏纪念馆在筹建中
    据新华社讯　四川眉山县“三苏公园”管理委员会，正在积极筹备成立“三苏纪念馆”。目前已收集到宋、元、明、清和国外出版的不同版本的三苏的文集、全集、刻本、碑帖、拓本等数千册。
    三苏就是苏洵、苏轼、苏辙。苏轼，字子瞻，又号东坡，世称长公，又称大苏。其弟苏辙，字子由，人称少公。苏东坡的父亲名苏洵，字明允，又称苏老泉、老苏。他们三人同在宋朝嘉祐二年考中进士，当时就闻名一时，后来都成为宋代著名的文学家和诗人。
    三苏的著作很多，特别是苏东坡的著作最多，他著有东坡集四十卷，后集二十卷，奏议十五卷，内制十卷，外制三卷，和陶诗四卷。
    眉山县位于四川南部岷江畔，是苏东坡的故里。现在眉山县城三苏公园内的三苏祠，为清康熙时重建，现祠内尚存宋元祐元年（公元1086年）所刻苏东坡书碑二座。
