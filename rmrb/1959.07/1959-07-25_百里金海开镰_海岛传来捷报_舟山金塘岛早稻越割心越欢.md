The Hundred-Li Golden Sea Opens for Harvesting Good news from the island
Zhoushan Jintang Island Early Rice Harvested, Hearts Filled with Joy

(Our report) The prelude to the bumper early rice harvest on the Zhoushan Islands of Zhejiang has begun.

The Jintang Island early rice, the first year after communization, grew unprecedentedly well, and the fields were covered with thick, golden rice. A few days ago, the ducklings of several commune members accidentally wandered into the paddy fields. However, it was easy to get in but difficult to get out. Once they got into the dense rice stalks, they became disoriented by the dense layers of rice plants and couldn't get out. The owners called from the banks of the fields, and the ducklings cried "Chirp, chirp, chirp" in the fields, but they couldn't get out. The owners' feet couldn't penetrate the dense layers of rice stalks, and they were anxious and helpless. Now, the commune members have locked up their ducklings. Everyone said: How can we let the ducklings go into such good rice and spoil it!

How many jin per mu can such good early rice yield? None of the commune members could estimate accurately. On the evening of the 17th, the Weiping Production Team decided to try harvesting the ripe early rice. When everyone arrived at the field of the First Team, they estimated the yield. Some said that this mu could yield 700 jin, and others said, "Let's wait and see." Old farmer Yin Ashan said: "Let's calculate 800 jin!" When leaving the village, everyone brought sixteen baskets. After harvesting and threshing, all the baskets were filled. They took three more from home, and the commune members pressed and shook the grain to pack it in. Upon weighing, the total was 1,394.5 jin of wet grain, which, discounted by 30%, was equivalent to 976.5 jin of dry grain. Everyone was extremely happy. The commune members said: Such a high yield really warms our hearts as we harvest, and we don't feel tired harvesting rice all day. On the 19th, another plot of rice was harvested, with yields of over 1,000 jin per mu. The commune members were overjoyed, posting good news of the harvest everywhere and writing quick-rhyme poems praising the leadership of the Party, praising the People's Communes, and praising the great harvest. Xu Yinxing's poem reads: "Hot, hot, hundreds of li of golden sea are open for harvesting, hands dance sickles to roll the golden sea; feet step on the threshing machine, golden flowers fly before our eyes; one drop of sweat, one jin of grain, the more sweat, the more happiness." The old farmers also said: Jintang Island has never had such a high yield since ancient times, this is thanks to Chairman Mao's blessing. Yin Yuqing, deputy secretary of the production team's Party branch, said: This year's early rice harvest alone is equivalent to three years of harvests before liberation.

The People's Commune brought about this year's bumper early rice harvest. In these days of harvest, everyone says the commune is good. This year's early rice has a high planting density, and deep plowing was implemented, greatly increasing the need for labor. But because of the establishment of canteens and nurseries, women's labor was liberated, and a large number of women participated in production. Not only was the season not delayed, but it was also advanced compared to previous years. As the saying goes, "Early Summer produces grain, Great Summer gives birth, Mid-Summer opens the sickle." But this year, the harvest began five days before Great Summer. The commune members said: If the season is not advanced, when the typhoon comes, it will be the time of flowering, and there will be no harvest; but this year, when the typhoon came, the rice was already ripe, and the losses were small. The women were especially happy. Fang Ruidi of the First Team said: "With the People's Commune, we can work with men. We learned to farm in the spring, and now we have reaped the fruits of the harvest. We are truly happy."

Conscientiously implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" is another important reason for this early rice to obtain high yields. For example, the planting time of early rice was appropriately advanced compared to last year; the planting density was also nearly doubled compared to last year; the rice fields had sufficient base fertilizer, and were plowed to a depth of eight inches, allowing the rice roots to penetrate deeply. A few days ago, when the typhoon passed, the rice all fell down, with the rice ears pressing on each other, like grain spread on a drying ground. Someone specifically looked for the grain that had been knocked down by the typhoon in the rice fields, but could not find it. The farmers said: If it weren't for reasonable close planting, the rice heads would have been blown down into the mud, and the grain would have turned into mud; if the season were not appropriately advanced, the typhoon would definitely affect grain filling and seed setting. Therefore, conscientiously implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" is also beneficial in resisting typhoons.

The island has more than 17,000 mu of early rice, and harvesting is continuing. The harvested early rice fields have all been plowed, and some of the fields have already been planted with late rice seedlings.

### 百里金海开镰  海岛传来捷报  舟山金塘岛早稻越割心越欢

    百里金海开镰  海岛传来捷报
    舟山金塘岛早稻越割心越欢
    本报讯　浙江舟山群岛早稻大丰收的序幕揭开了。
    公社化后第一年的金塘岛早稻生长空前良好，田野里铺满了厚厚的金黄谷子。前几天，有几户社员的小鸭偶然钻进了稻田。可是，走进容易走出难，一钻进稻丛，就被密密层层的稻株搞得昏天黑地，钻不出来了。主人在田岸上唤，小鸭在田里“啾啾啾”乱叫，就是走不出来，主人的脚插不进密密层层的稻丛，干着急，一点办法也没有。现在，社员们都把家里的小鸭关起来了，大家都说：这样好的稻子，哪能让小鸭钻进去糟蹋呢！
    这么好的早稻，一亩能收多少斤？社员们谁也估不准。17日晚上，卫平生产队决定把已成熟的早稻试割一下。大家来到第一小队的田头，就估计产量，有的说这一亩可收七百斤，有的说等着看吧，老农民殷阿善说：“算八百斤吧！”出村的时候，大家带来十六只箩筐，收好打好，所有箩筐全部装满，又从家里拿来三只，社员们把谷子压了又压、摇了又摇才装下去，一过秤，共计湿谷一千三百九十四斤半，打七折折合干谷九百七十六斤半。大家高兴极了，社员们说：这样高产量，真是越割心越热，整天割稻也不吃力。19日又收割了一片稻子，亩亩都是千斤多。社员心花怒放，到处张贴丰收喜报，编写快板诗，歌颂党的领导，歌颂人民公社，歌颂大丰收。徐银兴的一首诗写道：热了，热了，百里金海开镰了，手舞镰刀卷金海；脚踏打稻机，满眼金花飞；一粒汗水一斤谷，汗水越多越幸福。老农民也说：金塘岛自古以来没有这么高的产量，这是托毛主席的福。生产队党支部副书记殷余庆说：今年早稻一季可抵解放前的三年收成。
    人民公社化带来了今年的早稻大丰收。在丰收的日子里，人人都说公社好。今年早稻密植程度高，实行了深耕，劳力需要量大大增加。但是因为办了食堂、托儿所，解放了妇女劳力，大批妇女参加了生产，不但没有耽误季节，相反还比往年提早了。俗话说：“小暑出谷，大暑生育，中伏开镰。”但是，今年却在大暑前五天开镰了。社员说：如果季节不提早，台风来时，正是扬花时候，就会打得颗粒无收；但是今年台风来时，稻已黄熟，损失不大。妇女们特别高兴，第一小队方瑞弟说：“有了人民公社，我们能和男人一起干活，春天学会了种田，现在就获得了丰收的果实，真正高兴。”
    认真贯彻“八字宪法”，是这片早稻获得高产的又一个重要原因。如比去年适当提早了早稻种植的时间；密植程度，也比去年增加近一倍；稻田基肥很足，深耕八寸，稻根扎得深。前几天台风过境，稻子全部倒伏，稻穗一批压一批，稻子像晒场上铺的谷子一样。有人曾在稻田里专门寻找被台风打下的谷子，结果找不到。农民说：不是合理密植，稻头一定被刮倒在泥地里，谷子会变成泥浆谷；如果不适当提早季节种，台风过境，一定要影响灌浆结实。因此，认真贯彻“八字宪法”对抗台风也有好处。
    全岛有一万七千多亩早稻，现在正在继续收割。已收割的早稻田，已经全部耕好，有部分田已插下了晚稻秧苗。
