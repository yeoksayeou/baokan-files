The working methods of the Hu Guan County Party Committee in conscientiously implementing the mass line, summarizing past experiences, and improving the method of going to the countryside for mobile office work; this is another example of continuing to use and promote good working methods.

In the past, good leadership methods and working methods have been created in various places, such as planting "experimental plots," inspection and evaluation, mobile office work, etc. Some of these good leadership methods and working methods have been further developed in some places, but have been interrupted or stagnated in others. This year, some places have developed "experimental plots" into large-scale "command plots," thereby achieving a large-scale harvest this year. This is the beautiful flower blooming from the "experimental plot" and the fat fruit produced. The Hu Guan County Party Committee summarized the past methods of mobile office work, enriched it with new content, closely combined it with inspection and evaluation, regular visits and other methods, and further developed this mass line method, more powerfully promoting the great production movement. It can be seen that as long as good methods are adhered to and continuously improved, they can achieve greater results.

    好的工作方法
    壶关县委认真贯彻执行群众路线的工作方法，总结了过去的经验，改进了下乡巡回办公的方法；这是继续运用和发扬好的工作方法的又一榜样。
    过去，在各地都创造了一些好的领导方法和工作方法，如种“试验田”、检查评比、巡回办公，等等。这些好的领导方法和工作方法，有的地方有了新的发展，有的地方却中断或停滞了下来。今年有的地方把“试验田”发展成大面积的“指挥田”，从而取得了今年大面积的丰收。这就是“试验田”开出的美丽花朵，结出的肥硕果实。壶关县委总结了过去巡回办公的方法，充实了新的内容，密切结合了检查评比、定期访问等作法，又把这群众路线的方法发展了一步，更有力地推进了大生产运动。可见好的方法只要坚持运用，不断改进，是能够得到更大的成效的。
