    Careful Calculation, Increase Revenue, Reduce Expenditure
    Xingwang Brigade Achieves Good Production and Low Costs
    (According to the New Hunan Daily) The Xingwang Brigade of Huangshajie Commune in Yueyang County, Hunan Province, in organizing this year's Great Leap Forward in production, rationally utilized all manpower, materials, and financial resources to improve production and reduce production costs.

    This year, 70% of Xingwang Brigade's more than 1,900 mu of early and mid-season rice are first-class seedlings; the 31 mu of mid-season rice with third-class seedlings have also caught up to second-class seedlings after processing and topdressing. Currently, the early rice has headed and is shedding seeds, the mid-season rice is budding and pregnant with ears, and the late-season rice has also begun to round its feet and seal its rows. Economic crops such as cotton, jute, peanuts, and sweet potatoes are generally growing well. However, their production costs are lower than last year. This year, the "three guarantees" cost for the brigade's more than 5,100 mu of farmland averaged 6.7 yuan per mu. In the past six months, the actual expenditure was 7,860 yuan, averaging only 1.53 yuan per mu, accounting for 23% of the "three guarantees" cost. It is estimated that in the future, about 3,000 yuan will be spent on late rice production and economic crop cultivation. The total actual expenditure for the whole year will only account for about 34% of the "three guarantees" cost, a decrease of 74% compared to last year. Due to the attention paid to reducing production costs, it is estimated that about 24,000 yuan can be saved; calculated based on the brigade's 1,994 people, each person can earn an average of 12 yuan more.
      Diligently and Frugally Run the Commune, Increase Production and Increase Income
    In order to ensure increased income for commune members, when formulating this year's production plan, the Party branch mobilized commune members to discuss it. Commune members reflected that last year's expenditure was too high. Why was last year's expenditure too high? The brigade cadres conducted research and believed that: First, there was a lack of cost accounting thinking. They only focused on increasing production and did not pay attention to reducing costs, and inappropriately bought more chemical fertilizers. Second, some practices were promoted blindly without experimentation, resulting in waste. For example, in order to make human manure, more than 40,000 jin of salt were purchased, and some salt was discarded in the ponds without exerting its fertilizer effect. Third, the pursuit of pomp and circumstance wasted a lot of manpower, materials, and financial resources. Fourth, improper labor arrangement increased the use of work points and reduced the labor unit price for commune members. At the same time, the Party branch conducted education on "diligently and frugally running the commune, increasing production and increasing income" among the commune members, and established and improved the financial system. Through the "three guarantees," this year's production cost accounting was implemented in the production teams. In this way, a spirit of thrift was established among cadres and the masses.
          One Yuan Does the Work of Two
    In production, the brigade tried its best to save expenses and ensure that one yuan does the work of two. The brigade is surrounded by lakes on three sides, and the main source of fertilizer is from harvesting lake grass. Last year, when harvesting lake grass, the cadres believed that the lake grass in the inner lake was too shallow, and specially organized a batch of labor to harvest grass in the outer lake. The round trip took two days, resulting in 1,700 yuan in transportation costs and 800 yuan in lake grass management fees, only harvesting more than 23,000 dan. This year, after accepting the opinions of the masses, only organizing commune members to harvest grass in the inner lake, a total of 40,000 dan of lake grass was harvested before transplanting, only spending 270 yuan on lake grass management fees and 400 yuan on transportation fees. Including labor costs, the cost per dan of lake grass was reduced by 90% compared to last year. The brigade's lake grass is rich in green manure and has sufficient nitrogen fertilizer. Last year, a large amount of ammonium sulfate was purchased, resulting in lodging of rice seedlings. This year, the Party branch and the masses studied and decided that, except for buying 3,000 jin of ammonium sulfate for cultivating cotton seedlings, the money saved was used to buy 230,000 jin of lime. Commune members said with satisfaction: "This year's money is really used where it is needed most."

    In order to save production expenses, the brigade paid attention to fully and rationally utilizing existing manpower, materials, and financial resources, and tried to reduce cash expenditures. The Sanlian Production Team lacked three oxen during this year's spring plowing. Buying oxen would have cost more than 1,000 yuan. Through commune member discussions, the brigade organized specialists to train fourteen calves to undertake part of the plowing, harrowing, and leveling work, freeing up the large oxen to do heavy work, and organized teams with surplus oxen to support the Sanlian Team. The problem of ox shortage was successfully solved. When harvesting lake grass, the commune members lacked grass knives, but there were many waste grass knives among the scrap iron bought back by the brigade's iron workshop. The brigade mobilized workers to select more than 200 of them, which were completely usable after processing. This item alone saved more than 160 yuan in cash.
                Rational Arrangement, Increase Revenue, Reduce Expenditure
    In arranging labor, the brigade paid great attention to saving labor. Last year, there were 50 mu of rain-fed land planted with double-cropping rice, which required a lot of labor to pump water, and some even suffered from drought. This year, the brigade emphasized adapting to local conditions, changing to planting coarse grains and mid-season rice, which could increase production and save labor. For all agricultural tasks, production teams and work groups established acceptance systems to avoid the phenomenon of high work points and poor quality last year. Through these methods, they saved labor, expanded the cultivation of 700 mu of wasteland, and arranged for a portion of the labor force to collect river sand, recovering more than 5,000 yuan in cash and paying three wages.
                Compress Non-Production Expenditure
    In order to reduce production costs, the brigade resolutely compressed non-production expenditures. First, cadres were required to participate in production as much as possible. Production team cadres participated in production alongside commune members, earning work points for missed work, and spending more than two-thirds of their time each month participating in production. Second, they resolutely overcame all ideas of pomp and circumstance, did not build archways or set off firecrackers, and used old houses for the brigade headquarters, factories, and pig farms, keeping everything simple. Third, they tried to save on office supplies as much as possible. Because they were careful and thrifty everywhere, management expenses were greatly reduced. Currently, the actual expenditure only accounts for 9% of the annual expenditure plan.

    精打细算  开源节流
    兴旺大队生产好成本低
    据新湖南报消息　湖南岳阳县黄沙街公社兴旺大队在组织今年生产大跃进中，合理地运用一切人力、物力、财力，搞好了生产，降低了生产成本。
    今年，兴旺大队的一千九百多亩早、中稻，有70％是一类苗；三十一亩中稻三类苗，经过加工追肥，也赶上了二类苗。当前，早稻已勾头散籽，中稻正在含苞孕穗，一季晚稻也开始圆脚封行，棉花、黄麻、红薯、花生等经济作物普遍生长良好。但是，他们的生产成本却比去年低。今年全大队五千一百多亩田土，“三包”成本每亩平均六元七角。半年来，实际开支七千八百六十元，每亩平均只有一元五角三分，占“三包”成本的23％。预计在今后晚稻生产和经济作物培育上，需要再开支三千元左右，总计全年实际开支只占三包成本的34％左右，比去年降低了74％。由于注意降低生产成本，预计可以节约二万四千元左右；按全大队一千九百九十四人计算，每人平均能多收入十二元左右。
      勤俭办社，增产增收
    为了保证社员增加收入，在制订今年生产计划时，党总支发动社员进行讨论，社员反映去年开支过大。为什么去年开支过大呢？大队干部进行了研究：认为一是缺乏成本核算的思想，只顾增产，不注意降低成本，不适当地多买了一些化肥；二是有的作法没有经过试验，盲目推广，造成浪费。如为了造人粪尿，买盐四万多斤，有些盐就丢在池塘里，没有发挥肥效。三是追求排场，浪费了不少人力、物力、财力；四是劳力安排不当，多用了一些工，也降低了社员的劳动单价。同时，党总支向社员进行了“勤俭办社、增产增收”的教育，建立和健全了财务制度，通过“三包”把今年生产成本核算落实到生产队。这样，在干部和群众中树立了节约的风气。
          一个钱顶两个用
    在生产中，大队尽量想办法节约开支，做到一个钱顶两个钱用。这个大队三面靠湖肥料来源主要靠打湖草。去年打湖草时，干部认为内湖湖草太浅，专门组织了一批劳力到外湖打草，船只往返需要两天，结果花了一千七百元运费，八百元湖草管理费，只打得二万三千多担。今年接受了群众意见，光组织社员在内湖打草，在插秧以前共打回湖草四万担，只花了湖草管理费二百七十元、运费四百元。连人工在内，每担湖草成本较去年降低了90％。这个大队湖草青肥多，氮肥很足，去年又买回了大批硫酸铵，结果禾苗发生倒伏。今年党总支和群众研究，除培育棉苗买了三千斤硫酸铵外，把省下来的钱买回二十三万斤石灰。社员满意地说：“今年的钱真算用到刀口上了。”
    为了节约生产开支，大队注意充分地合理运用现有的人力、物力、财力，尽量缩减现金支出。三联生产队今年春耕中缺三条牛，买牛需要一千多元。通过社员讨论，大队组织专人训练十四条小牛，担负一部分耖田、横田、浪田工夫，腾出大牛干重活，并组织牛力有余的队支援三联队，缺牛问题顺利解决了。打湖草时，社员缺少草刀，可是大队铁工组买回的废铁中有很多废草刀，大队便发动工人挑选出二百多把，经过加工后，完全可用。光这一项就节省了现金一百六十多元。
                合理安排，开源节流
    在安排劳力上，大队很注意节省用工。去年有五十亩天水田，种了双季稻，车水花了很多工，有的还旱坏了。今年大队强调因地制宜，改种杂粮和中稻，既能增产，又能节省劳力。对各项农活，生产队和作业组都建立了验收制度，避免了去年工分多、质量差的现象。通过这些办法，他们把劳力节省下来，扩种了七百亩荒土，并安排了一部分劳力挑河砂，捞回现金五千多元，发了三次工资。
                压缩非生产开支
    为了降低生产成本，大队坚决压缩非生产开支。首先，做到干部尽量参加生产。生产队干部在生产上和社员同起同落，误工记工，每月有三分之二以上的时间参加生产。其次，坚决克服一切讲排场的思想，不扎牌楼、不放鞭炮，大队部、工厂、养猪场都利用旧屋，一切从简。第三，尽量节省办公用具。由于他们处处精打细算，管理费用大大节省。目前实际开支仅占全年费用计划的9％。
