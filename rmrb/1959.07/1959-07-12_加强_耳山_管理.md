    Strengthen Management of "Ear Mountains"
    Lìshēn
    Wood ear fungus is one of China's special local products from mountainous areas. According to its color, it can be divided into several types, such as black ear, white ear, and red ear. Black wood ear can be used as a dish and is a popular non-staple food among Chinese people.
    Most of China's black wood ear is artificially cultivated, but a significant amount also grows naturally in forests.
    Black wood ear is a crop that requires considerable technical expertise. According to the experience of key producing areas in Sichuan, Hubei, and Shaanxi provinces, it is currently necessary to strengthen the management of "ear mountains." In the "ear halls" (near the ear sheds), weeds and vines should be regularly removed to keep the forest land clean, and the main intersections should be barricaded to prohibit grazing and firewood gathering. In case of drought, efforts should be organized to sprinkle water using sprayers, water guns, etc., and the water should be clean. The amount of water should be sufficient to soak the ear sticks and the ground, neither too much nor too little. During seasons with excessive rainfall, precautions should be taken against flash floods washing away the ear sticks. If the ear hall is too wet or has accumulated water, drainage ditches should be dug.
    Black wood ear is considered top-grade when it is purely black in color, has large petals, is thick, dry, free of dust and impurities, and the ear foot does not have wood attached. To improve product quality, it is essential to seize the opportunity to harvest the ears and improve the ear-picking and ear-baking techniques.
    Many plants are suitable for propagating black wood ear, commonly used are: oak, chestnut, mulberry, elm, locust, birch, and ailanthus trees. In fact, general miscellaneous trees (except for trees of the camphor family, etc.) can also be used for wood ear production. Recently, the Shinan Production Brigade of the Shinan People's Commune in Yulin County, Guangxi Province, successfully cultivated wood ear using discarded cassava roots and stalks. Cultivating wood ear with cassava roots and stalks is simple and yields high income, with each hundredweight of raw materials producing wood ear worth fourteen yuan. The raw materials are readily available, without using timber.
    Currently, it is the peak season for black wood ear production. Strengthening the management of "ear mountains" and doing a good job in harvesting and drying wood ear will surely produce more black wood ear for this year's domestic demand and export.

    加强“耳山”管理
    立身
    木耳是我国山区土特产品之一。按其颜色不同可分为黑耳、白耳和红耳等几种。黑木耳可以作菜，是我国人民喜爱的副食品。
    我国黑木耳大部分是人工培植出来的，也有不少是在森林里自然生长的。
    黑木耳是一种技术性较强的作物。根据四川、湖北、陕西等省重点产区经验，当前必须加强“耳山”的经营管理。在“耳堂”（耳棚附近）要经常除去杂草藤蔓，保持林地清洁，并将主要路口拦好，禁止放牧采樵。如遇天旱，应该组织力量用喷雾器、水枪等进行洒水，用水要清洁。水的用量以能浸透耳棒和地皮为宜，过多过少都不好。在雨水过多季节，要谨防山洪暴发，冲走耳棒。耳堂过湿或已积水，应开沟排水。
    黑木耳以颜色纯黑、朵大、体厚、干燥、没有尘土杂质，耳脚不带木质的为上品。提高产品质量，必须抓住采耳时机和改进采耳和烤耳技术。
    适宜繁殖黑木耳的植物很多，常用的有：橡、栗、桑、榆、槐、桦、椿等树木。实际上，一般杂木（樟科等树种除外）也能用于生产木耳。最近广西省玉林县石南公社石南生产大队用废旧的木薯根和秆培植木耳成功。用木薯根和秆培植木耳，方法简单，收入大，每百斤原料可产价值十四元的木耳，原料易得，不用木材。
    目前正值黑木耳生产最旺盛的季节，加强“耳山”的经营管理，并做好木耳的采收、干燥工作，一定能为今年的民需、出口生产更多的黑木耳。
