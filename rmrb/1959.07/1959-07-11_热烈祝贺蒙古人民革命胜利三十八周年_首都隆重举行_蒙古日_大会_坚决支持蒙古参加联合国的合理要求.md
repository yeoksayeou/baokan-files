Xinhua News Agency, 10th: The people of the capital gathered solemnly tonight to firmly support the Mongolian People's Republic's reasonable demand to join the United Nations and warmly celebrate the 38th anniversary of the Mongolian People's Revolution.

July 11th is the 38th anniversary of the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution. Today's meeting was convened by the people of the capital in response to the call of the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council to hold a "Mongolia Day" on the 38th anniversary of the Mongolian People's Revolution. The meeting was jointly hosted by the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee and the China-Mongolia Friendship Association. More than a thousand people attended the meeting, including heads of people's organizations such as the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Women's Federation, the All-China Youth Federation, and the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries.

Burhan, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee, solemnly declared in his opening speech: The Chinese people severely condemn the unreasonable behavior of U.S. imperialism in obstructing the Mongolian People's Republic from joining the United Nations, and firmly believe that the United Nations should immediately accept the Mongolian People's Republic into the United Nations. With the support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, Asian-African countries, and the people of all countries in the world, the reasonable demand of the Mongolian People's Republic to join the United Nations will certainly be realized.

In his speech, Burhan extended warm congratulations on the 38th anniversary of the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution and celebrated the great achievements made by the Mongolian people in socialist construction. He emphasized that the people of China and Mongolia are as close as brothers and sisters, and have consistently cooperated and supported each other in the common cause of building socialism and safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world.

Burhan said that the Mongolian People's Republic has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy and implemented a policy of maintaining international peace and peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. Mongolia has now established diplomatic relations with countries representing more than half of the world's population and is making unremitting efforts to establish friendly relations with other countries on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect. Like the people of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, the Mongolian people are active participants in the world peace movement and have always sympathized with and supported the struggles of the Asian-African people and all oppressed people for national independence. This just position of the Mongolian People's Republic has won widespread support from peace-loving and just countries and people around the world, and the Mongolian People's Republic has full rights to become a member of the United Nations.

Burhan pointed out that the United States' obstruction of Mongolia's entry into the United Nations is actually inseparable from its hostility towards socialist countries and its undermining of the cause of peace. U.S. imperialism is continuing to pursue a policy of war and aggression throughout the world. In Asia alone, the United States is colluding with the reactionary Kishi Nobusuke government of Japan to step up the revival of Japanese militarism. The United States is still clinging to South Korea and is doing its utmost to obstruct the peaceful reunification of Korea. Recently, the United States instigated Laos to re-launch the civil war, undermining peace in Indochina and threatening the security of neighboring countries. U.S. imperialism continues to occupy our country's Taiwan, engaging in the conspiracy to create "two Chinas," carrying out military provocations against our country, constantly violating our country's territorial waters and airspace, and threatening peace in Asia and the world. All this shows that U.S. imperialism is the source of tension in the Far East and the world, and is the common enemy of the Mongolian people, the Chinese people, the Asian people, and all peace-loving people in the world!

Burhan concluded by saying that the United States' barbaric act of obstructing Mongolia's entry into the United Nations has aroused increasingly strong condemnation and opposition from just public opinion around the world. The holding of "Mongolia Day" fully demonstrates that the people of Asian countries and all peace-loving people stand on the side of the Mongolian people and firmly advocate that the Mongolian People's Republic join the United Nations.

Zhang Zhixiang, President of the China-Mongolia Friendship Association, emphasized in his speech that the people of China and Mongolia have a traditional and profound friendship. The Chinese people have always sympathized with and supported the Mongolian people's revolutionary struggle and have been encouraged by the Mongolian people's revolutionary victory.

He said that in the struggle against Japanese imperialist aggression, the people of China and Mongolia forged a close fighting friendship. In the cause of socialist construction, the people of the two countries have supported and cooperated with each other in various forms. The Chinese people will never forget the sympathy and support given by the Mongolian people in our people's struggle and construction. As close neighbors and brothers in the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, the economic and cultural cooperation between China and Mongolia will be further developed.

Zhang Zhixiang said that under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the industrious and brave Mongolian people have successfully completed two five-year plans and are currently striving to realize the three-year plan for the development of the national economy and culture. The Chinese people are delighted and encouraged by every achievement made by the fraternal Mongolian people in the cause of socialist construction. Zhang Zhixiang expressed his warm support for the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council's call to hold "Mongolia Day," congratulated the Mongolian People's Republic on its prosperity and strength, and wished that the fraternal friendship between the people of China and Mongolia would be as solid as a rock and last forever.

The audience of more than a thousand people applauded warmly for a long time to welcome Mongolian Ambassador to China, Sharav, to speak at the meeting. He said that for thirty-eight years, the Mongolian people have waged selfless struggles to consolidate their freedom and independence and to develop the country's national economy and culture. Our country now has large industrial enterprises such as industrial joint factories, meat processing plants, automated machinery factories, power plants, coal mines, non-ferrous metal mines, and oil factories. Our railways, aviation, water transport, highway transport, and modern postal and telecommunications industries are very developed. By 1960, the total industrial output value will increase by 53.2% compared with 1957. Our herdsmen have all joined production cooperatives, and the socialist economic system has basically been established in our countryside. Agricultural and pastoral cooperatives, livestock tractor stations, and state-owned farms will continue to be consolidated and strengthened. By 1960, the total number of livestock in our country will reach 25 million head. Our scientific, cultural, and educational undertakings have also developed rapidly.

The Ambassador said that the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other fraternal countries have provided multifaceted support and assistance for the development of our national economy and culture. This support and assistance has greatly encouraged the people of our country who are fighting on all fronts at home to establish a socialist material and technical foundation. The traditional friendship and economic and cultural cooperation between the fraternal people of Mongolia and China are developing and consolidating day by day.

The Ambassador said that in the thirty-eight years since the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution, our country has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy. Now our foreign relations have greatly developed. Our friendly relations with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and fraternal countries in Asia and Europe are becoming more consolidated day by day. The Mongolian People's Republic has always sympathized with and firmly supported the heroic struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America for freedom and independence. Developing friendly relations with the people of the above-mentioned countries is one of our important tasks. The Ambassador pointed out that the Mongolian people, together with the peace-loving people of the world, fully support the proposals put forward by the Soviet government to ban the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons, reduce armaments, peacefully resolve the German question, and hold a summit conference of great powers, all aimed at defending peace.

Ambassador Sharav concluded by saying that the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council meeting held in Cairo decided that July 11 this year, the 38th anniversary of the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution, would be the day to support the Mongolian People's Republic's entry into the United Nations. This resolution shows that the peace-loving people who constitute the majority in the world believe that the independent Mongolian People's Republic should obtain its due seat in the United Nations. The Mongolian people believe that their legitimate demands will certainly be realized, and the Mongolian People's Republic will eventually fully achieve its legitimate status on the international stage.

Nachukdorji, Vice Chairman of the Mongolia-China Friendship Association and head of the Mongolia-China Friendship Association delegation, pointed out in his speech that although U.S. imperialism is doing everything possible to obstruct the independent and autonomous Mongolian People's Republic from joining the United Nations, we believe that through the heroic struggle of the Mongolian people, we will eventually achieve victory and occupy its deserved seat in the United Nations.

This distinguished guest from Ulaanbaatar emphasized that Mongolia and China are close neighbors, and the people of the two countries have a traditional and profound friendship. In particular, the modern history of our two peoples is a history of jointly opposing imperialist aggression. In 1949, the great revolution of China won victory and the People's Republic of China was established. From that day on, the friendship between our two peoples entered a new stage of development. As members of the socialist camp, the cooperation between our two peoples in politics, economy, and culture is for the benefit of our two peoples and also for the benefit of world peace and the socialist camp. This cooperation is based on the rock-solid unity of proletarian internationalism, and has therefore achieved unprecedented development and consolidation.

In his speech, delegation leader Nachukdorji thanked the Chinese government and the Chinese people for their assistance to the Mongolian people's socialist construction cause, and wished the Chinese people continued great leaps forward and new brilliant achievements in the socialist construction cause.

All the speeches at today's meeting were met with continuous and enthusiastic applause from the audience.

Among those attending tonight's meeting were well-known figures from all walks of life and heads of various organizations, including Chu Tunan, Kang Yonghe, Liu Qingyang, Lao She, Cao Yu, Wang Jiong, Zhu Ziqi, and Wang Guangying. Diplomatic officials from the Mongolian Embassy in China, all members of the Mongolia-China Friendship Association delegation, and other Mongolian friends in Beijing were invited to attend the meeting. Asian and African friends in Beijing, including Korean peace activist Huang Fengjiu, Masajima Kan, director of the Japan-Soviet Association, a Kenyan foreign guest, and Oshwata, former Secretary-General of the East African Trade Union Federation, also attended tonight's meeting.

After the meeting, the documentary film "Ulaanbaatar-Beijing," co-produced by China and Mongolia, was shown. (Picture attached)

    热烈祝贺蒙古人民革命胜利三十八周年
    首都隆重举行“蒙古日”大会
    坚决支持蒙古参加联合国的合理要求
    新华社10日讯　首都各界人民今晚隆重集会，坚决支持蒙古人民共和国参加联合国的合理要求，热烈祝贺蒙古人民革命胜利三十八周年。
    7月11日是蒙古人民革命胜利三十八周年的纪念日。今天的大会是首都人民响应亚非人民团结理事会关于在蒙古人民革命胜利三十八周年举行“蒙古日”的号召而召开的。大会由中国亚非团结委员会和中国蒙古友好协会联合主持。中华全国总工会、全国妇联、全国青联、中国人民对外文化协会等人民团体的负责人等一千多人出席了大会。
    中国亚非团结委员会副主席包尔汉在大会开幕词中郑重宣称：中国人民严厉谴责美帝国主义阻挠蒙古人民共和国参加联合国的无理行为，坚决认为联合国应该立即接受蒙古人民共和国进入联合国。在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和亚非各国以及全世界各国人民的支持下，蒙古人民共和国加入联合国的合理要求是一定能够实现的。
    包尔汉在讲话中对蒙古人民革命胜利三十八周年纪念日表示热烈的祝贺，欢庆蒙古人民在社会主义建设方面取得的巨大成就。他强调说：中蒙两国人民情同手足，在建设社会主义和维护远东和世界和平的共同事业中，一贯相互合作，相互支持。
    包尔汉说，蒙古人民共和国一贯坚决地奉行和平的外交政策，一贯执行维护国际和平和不同社会制度的国家和平共处的政策。现在蒙古已经同全人类人口一半以上的国家建立了外交关系，并且为同其他国家在平等、互利和互相尊重的基础上建立友好关系而进行着不懈的努力。同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民一样，蒙古人民是世界和平运动的积极参加者，对亚非人民和一切被压迫人民争取民族独立的斗争，一向同情和支持。蒙古人民共和国的这种正义立场，得到全世界爱好和平与正义的国家和人民的广泛支持，蒙古人民共和国有充分的权利成为联合国会员国。
    包尔汉指出，美国阻挠蒙古进入联合国实际上是和它敌视社会主义国家和破坏和平事业分不开的。美帝国主义正在全世界继续推行战争和侵略政策。单就亚洲而言，美国正在同日本岸信介反动政府勾结，加紧复活日本军国主义。美国至今赖在南朝鲜不走，竭力阻挠朝鲜的和平统一。最近，美国更嗾使老挝重新发动内战，破坏印度支那的和平，威胁邻国的安全。美帝国主义还继续霸占着我国的台湾，进行制造“两个中国”的阴谋，对我国进行军事挑衅行动，不断侵犯我国的领海、领空，威胁着亚洲和世界的和平。这一切说明，美帝国主义是远东和世界紧张局势的根源，是蒙古人民、中国人民、亚洲人民和全世界爱好和平人民的共同敌人！
    包尔汉最后说，美国阻挠蒙古进入联合国的横蛮行为，引起了世界人民的公正舆论的愈来愈强烈的谴责和反对。“蒙古日”的举行充分地显示出，亚洲各国人民和一切爱好和平的人民都站在蒙古人民这一边，坚决主张蒙古人民共和国参加联合国。
    中国蒙古友好协会会长张致祥在讲话中强调指出，中蒙两国人民有着传统的深厚友谊。中国人民从来同情和支持蒙古人民的革命斗争，并从蒙古人民的革命胜利中得到鼓舞。
    他说，在反抗日本帝国主义侵略的斗争中，中蒙两国人民就结成了亲密的战斗友谊，两国人民在社会主义建设事业中，又以各种形式互相支援和互相合作。蒙古人民在我国人民斗争和建设中所给予的同情和支援，我国人民永不忘怀。作为亲密的近邻和以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭中的兄弟，中蒙两国的经济和文化合作必将得到进一步发展。
    张致祥说，勤劳勇敢的蒙古人民在蒙古人民革命党的领导下，已经胜利完成了两个五年计划，目前正在为实现发展国民经济和文化的三年计划而奋斗，中国人民为兄弟般的蒙古人民在社会主义建设事业中所取得的每一个成就感到欢欣鼓舞。张致祥对亚非人民团结理事会号召举行“蒙古日”表示热烈支持，祝贺蒙古人民共和国繁荣富强，祝中蒙两国人民的兄弟友谊坚如磐石，万古长青。
    全场一千多人长时间地热烈鼓掌，欢迎蒙古人民共和国驻中国大使沙拉布在大会上讲话。他说，三十八年来，蒙古人民为巩固自身的自由和独立、为发展本国的国民经济及文化曾进行了忘我的斗争。我国现在已拥有了工业联合工厂、肉品联合加工厂、自动化机械工厂、发电厂、煤矿、有色金属矿场和石油工厂等大型工业企业。我国的铁路、航空、水运、公路运输以及现代化的邮电事业都很发达。到1960年，全国工业的生产总值将比1957年增长53.2％。我国的牧民已全部加入了生产合作社，社会主义的经济体系已基本上在我国的乡村中建立起来。农牧业合作社、畜牧业拖拉机站和国营农场将继续巩固和加强。到1960，我国的牲畜总头数将达到二千五百万头。我国的科学、文化教育事业也有了飞跃的发展。
    大使说，苏联、中华人民共和国及其他兄弟国家对我国发展国民经济及文化的事业给予了多方面的支持和援助。这些支持和援助大大地鼓舞了在国内各个战线上为建立社会主义物质技术基础而斗争着的我国人民。蒙中两国的兄弟人民之间的传统友谊和经济、文化方面的合作正日复一日地发展和巩固。
    大使说，蒙古人民革命胜利以来的三十八年中，我们的国家一直执行着和平的外交政策。现在我国的对外关系已有了很大的发展。我国与苏联、中华人民共和国以及亚洲、欧洲的兄弟国家之间的友好关系正一天比一天巩固。蒙古人民共和国对亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民为争取自由、独立而进行的英勇斗争一贯怀有同情并坚决支持。发展与上述国家的人民之间的友好关系是我们的重要任务之一。大使指出，蒙古人民与全世界爱好和平的人民一起完全支持苏联政府提出的禁止原子武器和氢武器的试验、裁减军备、和平解决德国问题、举行大国首脑会议等旨在保卫和平的建议。
    沙拉布大使最后说，在开罗举行的亚非人民团结理事会会议决议定今年7月11日，即蒙古人民革命胜利三十八周年纪念日，为支持蒙古人民共和国加入联合国日。这一决议表明在世界上占大多数的爱好和平的人民认为独立的蒙古人民共和国应该在联合国里取得自己应有的席位。蒙古人民相信自己的正当要求一定能够实现，蒙古人民共和国终将在国际舞台上完全取得自己合法的地位。
    蒙中友好协会副主席、蒙中友协代表团团长那楚克道尔吉在讲话中指出，尽管美国帝国主义百般阻挠独立自主的蒙古人民共和国加入联合国，但是，我们相信，经过蒙古人民的英勇斗争，最后必将获得胜利，在联合国中占有它应得的席位。
    这位来自乌兰巴托的贵宾强调说，蒙中两国是亲密的邻邦，两国人民有着传统的深厚友谊。特别是我们两国人民的近代历史都是共同反对帝国主义侵略的历史。1949年中国的伟大革命取得了胜利，建立了中华人民共和国。从这一天起，我们两国人民的友谊进入了一个新的发展阶段。作为社会主义阵营大家庭中的我们两国人民在政治、经济、文化上的合作，是为了我们两国人民的利益，也是为了世界和平和社会主义阵营的利益，这种合作是建立在无产阶级国际主义坚如磐石的团结的基础之上的，因而获得了空前的发展和巩固。
    那楚克道尔吉团长在讲话中感谢中国政府和中国人民对蒙古人民社会主义建设事业的援助，并且祝中国人民在社会主义建设事业中继续大跃进，取得新的辉煌成就。
    所有今天大会上的讲话，都受到全场不断的热烈掌声。
    参加今晚大会的，有各界知名人士和各团体负责人楚图南、康永和、刘清扬、老舍、曹禺、王炯、朱子奇、王光英等人。蒙古驻华大使馆外交官员、蒙中友协代表团全体人员和在北京的其他蒙古朋友，应邀出席了大会。在北京的朝鲜和平人士黄凤九、日本日苏协会理事长马岛僴、怯尼亚外宾、前东非工会联合会总书记奥什瓦塔等亚非国家朋友，也出席了今晚的大会。
    会后，放映了中蒙合作摄制的纪录影片“乌兰巴托—北京”。（附图片）
