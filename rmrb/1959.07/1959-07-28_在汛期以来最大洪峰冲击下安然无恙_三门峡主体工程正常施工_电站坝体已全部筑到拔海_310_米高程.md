Xinhua News Agency, Sanmenxia, July 27th: The main structure of the Sanmenxia key water control project on the Yellow River – the dam body of the power station – was entirely built to an elevation of 310 meters above sea level on the 24th. Due to the varying depths of the riverbed, the height of the dam body itself varies, with the highest part already over 60 meters high. Together with the upstream transverse cofferdam built of loess gravel, it forms two copper walls and iron bastions, one in front and one behind, forcing the Yellow River water to the left bank, where it flows through the spillway dam, which occupies only a quarter of the original river channel.

On the 23rd, the dam had already withstood the test of the largest flood peak since the Yellow River entered the flood season this year. The flood peak from Tongguan had a flow rate of 13,000 cubic meters per second, and the water level in front of the dam reached a maximum height of 300.99 meters above sea level, 12 meters higher than the largest flood peak last year. Under such a large flood peak, the dam remained safe and sound, and construction continued normally. Due to the obstruction of the dam, the downstream flood peak was greatly reduced, and when the flood peak passed the Huayuankou station, the flow rate was only 6,000 cubic meters per second.

Starting from the third quarter, the Sanmenxia project has entered a new construction phase centered on installation work. Between the 300-meter and 310-meter elevation of the power station dam body, eight pressure steel pipes with a diameter of 7.5 meters will be installed to divert water to impel the power station's water turbines. Preparations for installation began in mid-July. At the same time, on the concrete piers rising inside the dam body, trestle bridges spanning the great river will be laid.

### 在汛期以来最大洪峰冲击下安然无恙  三门峡主体工程正常施工  电站坝体已全部筑到拔海310米高程

    在汛期以来最大洪峰冲击下安然无恙
    三门峡主体工程正常施工
    电站坝体已全部筑到拔海310米高程
    新华社三门峡27日电　黄河三门峡水利枢纽工程的主体工程——电站坝体，在24日全部筑到了拔海三百一十米的高程。由于河床深浅不同，大坝本体高低也不一样，最高的部分已高六十多米。它同用黄土砂砾石堆筑起来的上游横向围堰，形成两道铜墙铁壁，一前一后，把黄河水迫向左岸，由仅占原来河道四分之一宽的溢流坝流泄下去。
    23日，大坝已经经受了今年黄河进入汛期以来最大一次洪峰的考验。从潼关来的洪峰，流量达一万三千秒立方米，坝前水位最高时达到拔海三百点九九米的高度，比去年的最大洪峰高出十二米。在这样大的洪峰下，大坝安然无恙，依旧正常施工。由于大坝的阻挡，下游洪峰大大削减，当洪峰通过花园口站时，流量只有六千秒立方米。
    从第三季度开始，三门峡工程已进入一个以安装工程为中心的施工新阶段。在电站坝体的三百到三百一十米高程之间，将要安装八条直径七点五米的压力钢管，用来引水冲击电站的水轮机，安装的准备工作在7月中旬已经开始，同时，在坝体内升起来的混凝土墩子上，将要铺设横跨大河的栈桥。
