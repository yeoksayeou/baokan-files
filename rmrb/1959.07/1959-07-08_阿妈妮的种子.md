    Mother's Seeds
    Mao Zheng San, Zhou Min Zhen, Huo Xin
    Following a winding path, we arrived at a lush and sturdy rice paddy.

    This rice paddy, square and orderly, nestled under several lychee trees at the edge of the village. Before the rice was planted, it resembled a smooth and shiny mirror; once the seedlings were planted, it transformed into a thick, soft green carpet.

    The southern wind of May is like a comb, teasing out large handfuls of ripening grain.

    That day, as we picked bright red lychees beside it, our eyes greedily watched the waves it made, but our hearts thought of Mother, far beyond the clouds and mountains. This large expanse of dark green paddy field was cultivated from Korean seeds!

    Just think how far the journey must have been! The Yangtze River, the Yellow River, the Yalu River, the Chongchon River...

    Yes! The longer the journey, the more enticing this story becomes, like sweet spring water.

    It was the spring of 1953, when the production brigade leader here was still a volunteer soldier defending peace in Korea. Flowers bloomed red, grass grew green, snow mountains melted, and flocks of geese landed. The front lines in Korea presented a scene of spring.

    However, on the eve of their demise, the enemy still harassed the Korean people like a pack of wild wolves, both day and night.

    It was at this time that his close comrade-in-arms, a Korean soldier who fought alongside him, sacrificed himself in enemy fire! Heavens! That Mother, with her newly added white hair, had only this one son her entire life!

    In the trenches, he wrote a letter to this Korean mother, saying, "Dear Mother! Your son is dead, but you still have me as your son..."

    From then on, one at the front and one at the rear, green parcels were constantly opened before them. When snowflakes fluttered, the son sent letters to warm his mother’s heart; when azaleas dyed the hillside red, the son sent letters to report his safety to his mother.

    In this way, they forged a true mother-son relationship, like a mountain vine clinging to the forest, or a bird flying to its nest.

    The volunteer army was about to return to its homeland. So, he took leave and set out to see his Korean mother. In a mountain village still bearing the scars of war, he met her.

    The unexpected meeting brought them so much happiness, yet also permeated so much sorrow! Look, what should a mother give her son? After thinking it over, she grabbed a handful of seeds from the newly harvested granary and wrapped them in a piece of red cloth: "Child, a thousand words are not enough to express my feelings! Here, take this with you, this is your mother's heart. When you return home, plant them in the field, and every year you can eat Korean rice. Every time you pick up the bowl, you will think of me!..."

    And so, the seeds followed the production brigade leader back home after his demobilization, and have truly grown here year after year, flowering and bearing fruit.

    Years have passed like the mountain streams. The seeds have grown from few to many, and now they are planted on ten mu, twenty mu. The brigade leader has taken extra care in cultivating this first piece of soil! He has adorned the ridges like picture frames, and kept the water in the paddy clear and bright. Whether day or night, wind or rain, he has layered his most diligent footprints, one after another, beside it.

    But, can what appears before you be simply called a rice paddy? No, it is a cup of wine brewed with the friendship between China and Korea.

    The Chinese son has written another letter to his Korean mother:

    "Mother! The seeds you sent have now turned into a lush green expanse, and they are budding and heading, and will soon be flowering. In recent years, the abundant grain it has yielded is not only for me to taste, but for all the people in our village and brigade to taste..."

    Listening to such a story, looking at this verdant expanse, how can we not think of that distant Mother!

    阿妈妮的种子
    毛正三　周民震　霍新
    沿着一条弯曲的小路，来到了一块茂密茁壮的稻田。
    这块稻田，方方正正，拱围在村边的几棵荔枝树下，它在没长禾时，像一面又光又亮的镜子；禾苗插起了，它又变成了一张厚软软的绿毯。
    南方的5月的风，是一把梳子，把它拢出了大把大把的线穗。
    这天，我们在它身边摘着鲜红鲜红的荔枝，眼睛贪婪的看着它泛起的波浪，心却想起了那远隔云山的阿妈妮。这墨绿的大片稻田，就是用朝鲜的种子培育出来的啊！
    算一算，路途该有多远啊！长江、黄河、鸭绿江、清川江……。
    是啊！路途越长，这故事就越像清甜的泉水一样诱人。
    那是1953年的春天，这里的生产大队长，那时还是一个在朝鲜保卫和平的志愿军战士。花儿红了，草儿青了，雪山溶了，雁群落了，朝鲜的前沿阵地，呈现着一片春天的景象。
    但，敌人在死亡的前夕，却依然像群野狼，日蹿夜扰地骚扰着朝鲜人民。
    就在这时，他亲密的战友，和他并肩作战的一位朝鲜战士，牺牲在敌人的炮火里！天哪！那白发新添的阿妈妮，一辈子就只有这一个儿子啊！
    他在战壕里，给这位朝鲜母亲写了一封信，信里说：“亲爱的阿妈妮！你的儿子死了，可还有我这个儿子……。”
    从此，一个在前线，一个在后方，绿色的邮包，不断的在他们面前打开。雪花飘起的时候，母亲就信带来温暖；金达莱把山坡染红了时，儿子信给母亲传报平安。
    就这样，他们结下了真正的母子情谊，就像盘山的绿藤，恋林的飞鸟。
    志愿军要返回自己的祖国了。于是，他请了假，起了程，去看朝鲜妈妈。在一个还残留着弹痕的山村里，他见到了她。
    意外的相会，给他们带来了多少幸福，又渗透了多少辛酸！瞧，母亲该送些什么给儿子呢？她想来想去，就从新收的谷仓里，抓了一把种子，用块红布包了起来：“孩子，千言万语，都说不尽，道不完啊！给，把他带着，这是你妈妈的心，回到家种在田里，你每年就可以吃到朝鲜的大米，一端起碗，就会想到我啦！……”
    于是，这种子就随着生产大队长复员回来，真年年在这里含蕤吐秀地成长起来。
    几年的岁月，像山间的小溪的泉水流过去了。种子却从少到多，眼前已播到十亩，二十亩。大队长对这块最先培育的土壤，修整得够多仔细啊！他把田埂打扮得像一幅画框，田水调换得又清又明，不论白天夜晚，刮风下雨，他都将自己最辛勤的脚印，一串一串的叠落在它的身边。
    可是，出现在你面前的，能单纯的说是一块稻田吗？不，它是一杯酿着中朝两国情谊的酒。
    中国儿子又给朝鲜妈妈写信了：
    “阿妈妮！你送的种子，现在又变成了翠绿一片，它已含苞出穗，转眼又要扬花，几年来，它丰产的粮食，不光我能尝到，我们全村全大队的人，都能尝到……”
    听着这样的故事，看着这葱绿的一片，我们怎么能不思想那遥远的阿妈妮呢！
