Ultrasonics is a relatively new science. Ultrasound is sound with a high frequency that human ears cannot hear. The sounds we hear daily are caused by the vibrations of the air that reach us. Air vibrations can be fast or slow, and this speed is reflected in the pitch of the sound we hear. When air vibrates extremely fast, beyond a certain point, the human ear will not hear any sound. These inaudible sounds are ultrasound. The speed of vibration is scientifically called "frequency." Therefore, ultrasound is sound with a high frequency.

Frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz). Hertz represents the number of vibrations per second. For example, if something vibrates 1,000 times per second, we say the frequency is 1,000 Hz. Generally speaking, when the frequency of sound exceeds 16,000 Hz, the human ear cannot hear it. Sound with a frequency above 20,000 Hz is called ultrasound. The frequency of ultrasound can be as high as tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of megahertz.

Ultrasound is generally used more often in liquids and solids. Therefore, when discussing ultrasound, we need to talk about the propagation of ultrasound in liquids and solids.

Ultrasound has several prominent properties: in liquids and solids, ultrasound can travel very far. For example, in water, ultrasound can penetrate several kilometers, while radio waves can only penetrate tens of meters. In steel, ultrasound can penetrate about ten meters, while X-rays can only penetrate a fraction of a meter. Furthermore, ultrasound can be focused into a beam, unlike audible sound which often spreads in all directions. When using ultrasound to detect underwater targets in the ocean, these two properties are utilized—it can penetrate deeply and be focused into a beam like a searchlight. Related to these two properties is another important one: ultrasound is easily reflected, especially by small targets. For example, when ultrasound travels through steel, it is easily reflected by small holes a few millimeters in diameter, just like radar is reflected by an airplane in the sky. Therefore, ultrasound can be used to detect small holes in steel.

Now, ultrasonics has been developed in our country. Many ultrasonic technologies are already being applied in our country. It can be used in national defense, industry, medicine, and other fields. For example, in medicine, ultrasound is used to examine tumors and treat certain diseases; in metallurgy, ultrasound is used to improve the quality of alloy steel.

    超声的原理和应用
    超声学是门比较新的科学。超声是高频率的声音，人的耳朵听不到。人们日常听到的音声，起因于传来的空气的振动。空气振动可快可慢，这种快慢反映到听觉上就成为声调的高低。空气振动得异常快，快到超过某一程度时，人的耳朵就会听不到什么声音。这类听不到的声音就是超声。振动快慢，科学上称作“频率高低”，所以说超声就是高频率的声音。
    频率用赫来计量。赫是每秒钟振动的次数，比如每秒钟振动一千次，我们就说频率是一千赫。一般说来，声音的频率高过一万六千赫时，人耳就听不到。频率在两万赫以上的声音，才叫超声。超声的频率可以高到几万，甚至几十万兆赫。
    超声一般在液体里和固体里使用它的机会较多，因此谈超声时，就要谈液体里和固体里超声的传播。
    超声有几个突出的性能：在液体里和固体里超声能传得很远。如在水里超声能穿透几公里，而无线电波只能穿透几十米。超声在钢里可以穿透十米左右，而X光在钢里只能穿透一米的十分之几。此外，超声能成束，而不像可听声那样经常四面散开。用超声在海洋里探测水下的目标时，就要利用这两个性能，一方面能穿透得深，一方面能像探照灯灯光似地成束。和这两项性能有关的，另有一个重要性能，就是超声容易被反射，特别容易被较小的目标反射。如超声在钢里传播时，碰上钢内几毫米直径的小孔，就容易被这小孔反射，好像雷达被空中的飞机反射一样。所以，超声能用来探测钢里的小孔。
    现在，超声学已经在我国发展起来。许多超声的技术，已经在我国应用。它可以用在国防、工业、医药等方面。如在医学方面，有用超声来检查肿瘤和治疗某些疾病的；冶金方面，有用超声来提高合金钢的质量的。
