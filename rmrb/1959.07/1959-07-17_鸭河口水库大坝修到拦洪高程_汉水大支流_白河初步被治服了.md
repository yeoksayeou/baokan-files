Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 16th - The Duck River Estuary Reservoir on the Bai River in Henan Province, the second largest reservoir in the province after the Nanwan Reservoir on the Huai River, had its dam rushed to a safe flood control elevation of twenty-five meters by the 8th of this month. With this, the second phase of the reservoir project has been successfully completed. It can now withstand floods that occur once every hundred years, and the Bai River has been initially subdued.

The Bai River is a major tributary of the Han River, originating from the Funiu Mountains, running vertically through the western Henan plain, and flowing into the Han River in Xiangfan City, Hubei Province. The river is two hundred and ninety kilometers long with a drainage area of twelve thousand one hundred square kilometers. The distribution of rainfall in the basin is uneven, mostly concentrated in the flood season. In the event of a flood peak that occurs once every fifty years, the flow rate reaches eight thousand two hundred cubic meters per second. However, the river channel in Xinye County downstream can only handle a flow rate of seven thousand cubic meters per second, so more than one million mu of land is often threatened by floods. The completion of this reservoir will fundamentally end the flooding disasters downstream of the Bai River.

The Duck River Estuary Reservoir dam is built at the Duck River Estuary in Nanzhao County, upstream of the Bai River. The dam crest is three thousand three hundred meters long and thirty-one meters high. The main projects of the reservoir, in addition to the dam, also include a water diversion tunnel that is one hundred and forty meters long, a spillway that is two hundred and thirty meters long and forty-two meters wide, and a hydroelectric power station. After the entire project is completed, the reservoir area of one hundred square kilometers can store 1.12 billion cubic meters of floodwater and irrigate 670,000 mu of farmland. Four turbine generator units will be installed, generating 24 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, which can supply industrial electricity and urban and rural lighting in the Nanyang area. In the river channel downstream of the reservoir, ships with a load of fifty tons can smoothly reach the Han River and the Yangtze River.

The Duck River Estuary Reservoir project started on November 28 last year, and the first phase of the project was completed by April 22 this year. Now that the second phase of the project has been completed, the third phase of the project has already begun.

    鸭河口水库大坝修到拦洪高程
    汉水大支流—白河初步被治服了
    据新华社郑州16日电　河南省仅次于淮河南湾水库的第二个大水库——白河鸭河口水库，到本月8日大坝已抢筑到安全拦洪高程二十五米。至此，这个水库的第二期工程即胜利完工。已经可以拦住百年一遇的洪水，白河初步地被治服了。
    白河是汉水的一大支流，发源于伏牛山脉，纵贯豫西平原，流至湖北省的襄樊市汇入汉水，河道全长二百九十公里，流域面积达一万二千一百平方公里。流域内降雨量的分布不均匀，多集中在汛期，如遇五十年一遇的洪峰，流量达八千二百秒立方米。但下游新野县境的河道，仅能通过七千秒立方米的流量，因此常有一百多万亩土地受洪水威胁。这个水库的建成将从根本上结束白河下游的水灾。
    鸭河口水库的大坝建在白河上游南召县的鸭河口，坝顶长三千三百米，高三十一米。水库主要工程除大坝外，还有长达一百四十米的输水隧洞和长二百三十米、宽四十二米的溢洪道及水电站。全部工程完成后，在一百平方公里的库区内可拦蓄洪水十一点二亿立方米，能灌溉六十七万亩农田；安装四台水轮机发电机组，每年发电二千四百万度，可供给南阳一带的工业用电和城乡照明。水库下游河道内，载重五十吨的船，可以畅达汉水和长江。
    鸭河口水库工程在去年11月28日开工后，到今年4月22日即完成了第一期工程，现在在完成了第二期工程以后，第三期工程已经开工。
