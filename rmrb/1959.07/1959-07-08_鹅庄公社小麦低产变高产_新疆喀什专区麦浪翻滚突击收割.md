    Goose Village Commune Transforms Low Wheat Yields into High Yields
    Wheat Waves Roll in Kashgar Region, Xinjiang, in a Rush Harvest
    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, July 7th: The Goose Village People's Commune in the suburbs of Linyi City, Shandong Province, an area with historically low wheat yields, has achieved an average yield of 270 jin of dry wheat per mu across its 31,746 mu of wheat fields this year, an increase of 112.6% compared to last year.

    In the past, this commune's wheat yields were consistently around 100 jin per mu due to shallow and rough cultivation and poor soil quality. Why were yields always so low? Before winter planting last year, commune members identified four reasons through discussion: shallow plowing, only two or three inches deep; rough harrowing; failure to apply base fertilizer to over 70% of the remote and low-lying areas; and a shortage of good seeds, mixed seeds, and sparse planting. In response to these reasons, everyone proposed four transformations: from shallow and rough cultivation to meticulous cultivation, from no fertilization to fertilization, from inferior seeds to improved seeds, and from sparse planting to reasonable close planting. Based on these opinions, the commune party committee organized over 80% of the workforce, engaged in a 20-day battle, and deep-plowed all wheat fields to a depth of about one foot, applying base fertilizer while plowing and harrowing the fields. Furthermore, irrigated fields were converted into ridge fields. After improving water, fertilizer, and soil conditions, the average seeding rate per mu increased dramatically to about 25 jin, more than double the previous year. 90% of the commune's wheat seeds were the Bima No. 1 and No. 4 improved varieties, expanding the area sown with improved varieties by more than four times compared to last year.

    This commune also focused on managing the three categories of wheat seedlings this year. The commune and teams established command headquarters for eliminating the three categories of seedlings, mobilizing over 3,000 people to form 82 specialized teams to manage the three categories of seedlings. As a result, all 5,035 mu of the three categories of seedlings in the commune were upgraded, achieving balanced yield increases.

    Our newspaper Urumqi, July 7th: More than 2.3 million mu of wheat in the Kashgar region of Xinjiang are universally ripe, and an intense battle to seize the wheat harvest has fully unfolded in every county (city) of the region. From the banks of the Kashgar River to the oases on both sides of the Yarkand River, wheat waves are rolling everywhere, and the sounds of people and horses fill the air. Hundreds of thousands of laborers from eighty-one people's communes across the region are enthusiastically engaged in rushing to harvest and thresh. Uyghur male and female commune members are joyfully joining the first wheat harvest battle since communization.

    This year, the wheat acreage in the Kashgar region has increased by more than 500,000 mu compared to last year. Due to the earnest implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, wheat growth is generally better than last year, and many counties have achieved large-scale high yields. To complete the wheat harvest task in a timely manner and ensure a bumper harvest, various regions have universally established wheat harvest command headquarters or wheat harvest committees, strengthened leadership of the wheat harvest work at all levels, and generally mobilized about 80% of the labor force to participate in the wheat harvest battle, and transferred manpower from organs, schools, service industries, and industrial, enterprises, and water conservancy construction fronts to support the wheat harvest.

    The speed of this year's wheat harvest is faster than in previous years. In Yingjisha County, more than 10,000 mu of wheat have been harvested within a week of the start of the harvest. After the Mimai Commune in Shache County launched a red flag competition, it harvested more than 2,200 mu of wheat in two days, and the commune members are determined to complete the harvesting of 28,000 mu of wheat in the whole commune within ten days.

    In order to ensure fast harvesting and threshing, and a clean and thorough harvest, specialized teams for harvesting, bundling, transporting, threshing, and warehousing have been universally organized, achieving simultaneous harvesting, threshing, transportation, and warehousing, ensuring that the wheat harvest proceeds in an orderly manner. Some communes have also established inspection and acceptance systems, dispatching special personnel to inspect the harvesting, bundling, transporting, threshing, winnowing, and warehousing processes, achieving inspection at every stage, acceptance at every point, ensuring that no ears are lost in any link, and that no grains are dropped in any stage. Therefore, the quality of the wheat harvest throughout the region this year is generally better than in previous years.

    鹅庄公社小麦低产变高产
    新疆喀什专区麦浪翻滚突击收割
    新华社济南7日电　山东临沂市郊区小麦一向低产的鹅庄人民公社，今年三万一千七百四十六亩小麦平均亩产干麦二百七十斤，比去年增产112.6％。
    过去，这个社由于浅耕粗作，土质瘦薄，小麦产量历年都在百斤左右。为什么总是低产呢？去年冬播以前，这个社的社员们经过辩论找出了四个原因：耕的浅，只有两三寸；耙的粗；70％以上的偏僻洼地不施底肥；良种少，种子杂，种的稀。针对这些原因，大家提出了四变：变浅耕粗作为精耕细作，变不施肥为施肥，变劣种为良种，变稀植为合理密植。公社党委根据这些意见，组织了80％以上的劳动力，大战二十天，把全部麦田都深翻一尺左右，并且边翻地边施底肥，翻后耙平，又把水浇田改成畦田。在水、肥、土等条件改变以后，全社小麦平均每亩的播种量也激增到二十五斤左右，比往年增加一倍多。全社90％的麦种是碧蚂一、四号小麦良种，良种面积比去年扩大了四倍多。
    这个公社今年还狠狠抓住了对小麦三类苗的管理。社、队都建立了消灭三类苗指挥部，发动三千多人组成八十二个消灭三类苗专业队，分工管理三类苗。这样一来，全社五千零三十五亩三类苗块块垅垅都升了级，达到了平衡增产。
    本报乌鲁木齐7日电　新疆喀什专区二百三十多万亩小麦普遍黄熟，一场紧张的夺麦大战已在全专区各个县（市）全面展开。从喀什噶尔河畔到叶尔羌河两岸的绿洲上，到处麦浪翻滚，人马喧腾。全专区八十一个人民公社出动了数十万劳动大军抢收、抢打。维吾尔族男女社员欢欣鼓舞的投入公社化后第一个麦收战斗。
    今年喀什专区小麦面积比去年扩大了五十多万亩。由于切实贯彻了农业“八字宪法”，小麦生长情况普遍比去年良好，许多县都获得了大面积丰产。各地为了及时完成麦收任务，保证丰产丰收，普遍成立了麦收指挥部或麦收委员会，层层加强了麦收工作领导，一般都把80％左右的劳动力投入到麦收战斗，并从机关、学校、服务行业和工业、企业、水利建设等战线上抽调人力支援麦收。
    今年麦收速度比往年进展快。英吉沙县在开镰一周内，已收割小麦一万多亩。莎车县米麦公社展开红旗竞赛后，两天内收割小麦二千二百多亩，社员决心在十天内完成全社二万八千亩小麦收割任务。
    为了保证快收快打，打净收净，普遍组织了收割、捆扎、拉运、打场、入仓等专业队，做到了边收、边打、边运、边入仓，保证了麦收有条不紊的进行。有些公社还建立了检查、验收制度，派出专人检查收、捆、运、碾、扬、入仓等工序，做到了关关检查、口口验收、环环不失穗、节节不掉粒，因而今年全专区的麦收质量普遍比往年好。
