    Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 2 Blast Furnace Born in Friendship and Support
    Equipment and Building Materials Supplied by Thousands of Factories and Mines in Twenty Provinces and Cities Across the Country
    Soviet Experts Make Valuable Contributions in Ensuring Project Quality

    (Our newspaper, Wuhan, July 14) The Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 2 blast furnace and related projects received enthusiastic support from thousands of factories and mines in twenty provinces and cities during construction. They did everything possible to rush-produce equipment and supply building materials for Wuhan Iron and Steel.

    The Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 2 blast furnace and the supporting projects supplying fuel and raw materials, such as the No. 3 coking oven, sintering plant, and ore dressing plant, are grand in scale. The more than 40,000 tons of equipment required were mostly manufactured domestically. The building materials used, just steel, wood, and cement alone, required more than 3,400 train cars to transport. These equipment and materials came from all directions of our country: there was petroleum and asphalt from Gansu, nanmu bamboo from Guangxi, asbestos tiles from Jilin, and machinery and equipment from Liaoning; Wuhan, Huangshi, Guangshui, Jiayu and other places in Hubei also supplied tens of thousands of tons of bricks, tiles, sand and gravel to Wuhan Iron and Steel.

    Many factories put the task of supporting Wuhan Iron and Steel's No. 2 blast furnace first, doing everything possible to overcome equipment and technical difficulties. In the second quarter, the Shenyang Chengfa Gate Valve Factory manufactured cooling serpentine tubes for Wuhan Iron and Steel’s No. 3 coking oven. The shape of the cooling serpentine tube was complex, and the quality requirements were very strict due to the high pressure it had to withstand. Chengfa Gate Valve Factory had never manufactured this product before, and encountered many technical difficulties. Cheng Yongman, the director of the factory, took workshop director Gong Xizhi, veteran worker Gu Youde, and others to Benxi and other places to learn; during the manufacturing process, the factory director and engineers went down to the groups to work, and worked with the workers to repeatedly test and manufacture. When there were not enough furnaces for baking the mud core, and the molten iron supply could not keep up, they added baking furnaces and iron melting furnaces. After overcoming a series of difficulties, they finally completed the production task of four sets of cooling serpentine tubes in less than a month, ensuring the construction needs of Wuhan Iron and Steel's No. 3 coking oven. Dalian Gate Valve Factory, in the process of manufacturing 2,000 cyclones for Wuhan Iron and Steel's No. 1 and No. 2 sintering machines, initially had a high reject rate because the cyclones were easily damaged. After concentrating efforts, improving technology, and organizing cooperation with other factories, they completed the task in just two months by early May. The product quality was very good and the installation was smooth. The Hanyang Machinery Factory in Wuhan City had few personnel and insufficient equipment, but they put forward the slogan "Fight to support the No. 2 blast furnace," and tried every means to overcome the difficulties of insufficient machine tools and lack of lifting equipment. They manufactured more than 270 tons of large castings for Wuhan Iron and Steel's No. 2 blast furnace on schedule, and the quality was also very good. Many factories were willing to sacrifice part of their own interests in their support to ensure the needs of Wuhan Iron and Steel's key projects. Wuhan Iron and Steel's ore dressing plant lacked 130-kilowatt motors for the first and second rows of flotation machines. The Xiangtan Electrical Machinery Factory did not have time to manufacture them, and finally gave the motors used for its own basic construction to Wuhan Iron and Steel, so that the ore dressing plant could be put into trial operation in time.

    The leaders of many provinces and cities across the country also regarded supporting Wuhan Iron and Steel as a glorious task in implementing the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard." The municipal party secretaries and mayors of Wuhan, Harbin, Lushun-Dalian, Tangshan and other cities that bore a relatively heavy support task personally supervised and inspected the situation of rushing to manufacture equipment and materials for Wuhan Iron and Steel, and gave priority to ensuring the needs of Wuhan Iron and Steel in terms of planning arrangements and material supply. Wuhan Iron and Steel also received huge support from railway transportation departments and Yangtze River shipping departments.

    (Our newspaper, Wuhan, July 14) During the construction of Wuhan Iron and Steel’s No. 2 blast furnace, Soviet experts made valuable contributions by putting forward many major suggestions in ensuring project quality and the close coordination of various production processes.

    During the construction of the No. 2 blast furnace, Badurov, the leader of the Soviet expert group, often emphasized: "We must not only complete the blast furnace on schedule, but also ensure that it can produce well after completion." He reminded everyone to pay attention to project quality and the coordination of various production processes. Metallurgical expert Sherbakov conducted a comprehensive study of the No. 2 blast furnace from design, construction, equipment supply, production preparation and other aspects, and put forward many major suggestions. He found in the design review that the blast furnace dust collector had no lining, and after the furnace was started, the iron shell of the dust collector would be attacked by gas impurities and would wear out quickly. He suggested that the dust collector should be lined with heat-resistant concrete, which would be important for extending the life of the dust collector and maintaining high-pressure operation. Sherbakov also systematically studied the experience of No. 1 blast furnace since its start-up in reducing coke ratio, reducing batch size, increasing smelting intensity, and maintaining the taphole, in order to prepare technically for the commissioning of No. 2 blast furnace. Furnace building expert Furizhkoff and machine installation expert Skuratov were both personally on site every day, braving the summer heat of Wuhan, guiding and working at the same time, and often did not rest on Sundays. Skuratov had a chronic leg disease and had difficulty walking, but in order to ensure the quality of the installation, he climbed to the top of the 60-meter-high blast furnace to help Chinese workers install and adjust equipment, regardless of wind or rain. Skuratov also suggested using a new method of padding asbestos rope at the flange connection of the hot blast stove to make the flange connection under great pressure airtight. On the eve of his return to China on June 22, he climbed to the top of the blast furnace several times to help adjust the equipment.

    Badurov, the leader of the Soviet expert group with 35 years of experience in black metallurgical enterprises, was particularly concerned about the two links of raw material supply and auxiliary engineering. The Soviet experts, led by Badurov, went to Daye and Lingxiang in the rain at the end of March and early April this year to understand the iron ore supply plan and the construction of the ore dressing plant, and put forward the suggestion of "ore neutralization," using low-sulfur ore and high-sulfur ore, lean ore and rich ore in a comprehensive manner, so that the ore production has gradually increased since May, and the grade has become more stable, which has increased the ore reserves for the No. 2 blast furnace. Auxiliary projects such as raw material warehouses, material bin trestles, No. 6 pumping station, and No. 3 pig iron machine did not have a large workload, but if one of them did not keep up with the main project, it would affect the normal production of the blast furnace. Badurov went to the site of these projects almost every day to understand the progress of construction and promptly asked the leaders of Wuhan Iron and Steel to solve the problems encountered.

    Soviet factories also delivered the high-quality, technically complex equipment required by Wuhan Iron and Steel's No. 2 blast furnace, such as the furnace top hoist, electrical control panel, weighing car, and blower, to Wuhan Iron and Steel ahead of schedule or on schedule, ensuring the smooth construction of the No. 2 blast furnace.

    武钢二号高炉在友谊支援中诞生
    全国二十个省市上千厂矿供应设备和建筑材料
    苏联专家在保证工程质量等方面作出宝贵贡献
    本报武汉14日电　武钢二号高炉及有关的工程，在建设中得到二十个省市、上千个厂矿的热情支援。他们千方百计为武钢赶制设备，供应建筑材料。
    武钢二号高炉和为它供应燃料原料的三号焦炉、烧结厂、选矿厂等工程，规模宏伟，所需的四万多吨设备，绝大部分都是国内制造。所用的建筑材料，仅钢材、木材、水泥三项，就得用三千四百多个车皮装运。这些设备材料来自我国四面八方：有甘肃的石油、沥青，广西的楠竹，吉林的石绵瓦，辽宁的机器设备；湖北的武汉、黄石、广水、嘉鱼等地，也为武钢供应了成万吨的砖瓦砂石。
    许多工厂把支援武钢二号高炉的任务放在首位，千方百计克服设备、技术上的困难。第二季度，沈阳成发闸阀厂为武钢三号焦炉制造冷却蛇管，冷却蛇管的形状复杂，由于承受高压，质量要求很严，成发闸阀厂过去从没制造过这种产品，在技术上遇到很多困难。这个工厂的厂长程永满就带着车间主任龚希志、老工人顾有德等到本溪等地学习；在制造过程中，厂长、工程师都下组劳动，和工人一起投入战斗反复试制。烘坭心的炉子不够，铁水供不上，他们就增建烘炉、化铁炉。经过克服一连串的困难，他们终于在不到一个月的时间，完成了四套冷却蛇管的生产任务，保证了武钢三号焦炉的建设需要。大连闸阀厂在给武钢一、二号烧结机制造两千个旋风子的过程中、因为旋风子容易损坏，开始废品率很高，经过集中力量，改进技术，组织其他厂协作，到5月初仅两个月的时间就完成了任务，产品质量很好，安装顺利。武汉市汉阳机器厂人员少，设备不足，但他们提出“为支援二号高炉而战”的口号，想方设法克服了机床不够、起重设备缺乏的困难，按期为武钢二号高炉制成了二百七十多吨大型铸件，质量也很好。许多厂在支援中宁愿牺牲本单位的部分利益，确保武钢重点工程的需要。武钢选矿厂一、二列浮选机缺少一百三十瓩的马达，湘潭机电厂来不及制造，最后把本单位基本建设用的马达给了武钢，使选矿厂得以及时试车。
    全国许多省市的领导人，也都把支援武钢作为贯彻全国一盘棋方针的光荣任务。担负支援任务比较重的武汉、哈尔滨、旅大、唐山等城市，市委书记、市长都亲自督促检查为武钢赶制设备材料的情况，并在计划安排、材料供应方面，优先保证武钢的需要。武钢还得到了铁路运输部门、长江航运部门的巨大支援。
    本报武汉14日电　在武钢二号高炉建设过程中，苏联专家们在确保工程质量和各生产工序紧密衔接等方面提出了许多重大建议，作出了宝贵贡献。
    在二号高炉建设期间中，苏联专家组长巴杜洛夫经常强调说：“我们不仅要按期建成高炉，而且要使它建成后能够很好地生产。”他提醒大家注意工程质量和各生产工序的衔接问题。炼铁专家谢尔柏柯夫对二号高炉从设计、施工、设备供应、生产准备等各个环节，都进行了全面研究，提出了许多重大建议。他在审查设计中就发现高炉除尘器没有内衬，开炉后将使除尘器的铁壳受到煤气杂质的侵袭而很快磨损，提出了除尘器要砌上耐热混凝土内衬的建议，对延长除尘器寿命和保持高压操作有重要作用。谢尔柏柯夫还系统地研究了一号高炉开炉以来在降低焦比、减少料批、提高冶炼强度、维护出铁口等经验，为二号高炉投入生产作好技术上的准备。筑炉专家附列日科夫、机器安装专家斯库拉托夫，都是每天亲临现场，冒着武汉夏季的酷热，边指导边干，星期日也往往不休息。斯库拉托夫腿有宿疾，走路不方便，但是他为了保证安装质量，不管刮风下雨，都要爬到高达六十多米的高炉炉顶帮助中国工人安装和调整设备。斯库拉托夫还建议用新的方法在热风炉法蓝连接处垫石绵绳，使受压力很大的法蓝连接处作到密不漏气。他在6月22日回国的前夕，还几次爬上高炉炉顶帮助调整设备。
    具有三十五年黑色冶金企业工作经验的苏联专家组长巴杜洛夫，特别关心原料供应和辅助工程两个环节。以巴杜洛夫为首的苏联专家们，曾在今年3月底、4月初冒雨前往大冶、灵乡，了解铁矿的供矿计划和选矿厂的施工情况，并提出了“矿石中和”的建议，把低硫矿和高硫矿、贫矿和富矿综合搭配使用，使矿石从5月份以来产量逐渐提高，品位更加稳定，为二号高炉增加了矿石储备。原料仓库、料仓栈桥、六号水泵站、三号铸铁机等辅助工程，工作量不大，但是如有一项跟不上主体工程，就会影响高炉的正常生产，巴杜洛夫几乎每天都要到这些工程的现场了解施工进度，遇到问题，及时提请武钢领导人解决。
    苏联有关工厂也将武钢二号高炉所需的质量优等、技术复杂的设备，如炉顶卷扬机、电气操纵盘、秤量车、鼓风机等，都提前或按期运到武钢，保证了二号高炉顺利建设。（附图片）
