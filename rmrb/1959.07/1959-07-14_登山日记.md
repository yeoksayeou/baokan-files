Mountain Climbing Diary
　　Wang Fengtong Yang Kexian

　　Fighting the Blizzard
　　July 3rd.

　　After two marching exercises and with everyone's optimistic mood about conquering Muztagh Ata, more than 40 male and female mountaineers climbed from the base camp at 4,500 meters above sea level to the first high mountain camp at 5,500 meters above sea level in just over three hours yesterday. Some team members sang, some cooked, some played cards, and all felt as if they were living on flat ground without any unusual feelings.

　　However, it seemed that the heavens were deliberately making things difficult. It greeted the mountaineers to the "snow line" area with clear weather, but then suddenly turned gloomy. Since last night, dark clouds have covered the sky. Wind and snow bombarded Muztagh Ata, and the mountains and the area below were completely blurred in the snow curtain. "Storms, ice, snow, and lightning can only make us stronger and braver!" This has almost become the motto for mountaineers to overcome difficulties. At around 8:30 in the morning, the team members still braved the snow and continued to move forward in groups.

　　More than 40 people advanced in a long line in the snow curtain, with people in the back unable to see anyone more than 50 meters ahead. Everyone proceeded silently, with few rests, and the speed of advancement was fast. Along the way, steep ice slopes of more than 40 degrees, "icefalls," and countless cracks were all safely crossed. Because of the fluctuating hot and cold weather in the previous two or three days, many new hard ice slopes, formed by the melting and refreezing of accumulated snow, had formed on the mountain. Some team members, wearing mountaineering boots with "crampons" attached, still slipped down such ice slopes several times, but eventually climbed up with each other's help.

　　The northwest wind blew harder and harder, and the temperature was below freezing, making the snowflakes stinging and unbearable when they hit the face. With the rapidly rotating cold wind, snowflakes drilled into the team members' necks, sleeves, and mountaineering boots, but all of this could not stop the team members from moving forward.

　　The snow fell heavier and heavier, and the team members behind could no longer find the footprints of the trailblazers, because the footprints were quickly filled with snow. The snow fell heavier and heavier, and the icefall area, with its extremely spectacular scenery, was completely blurred. Even the snow rocks as tall as three-story buildings could only be seen when resting next to them. Because of the perennial effects of fluctuating hot and cold weather and snow layer collapse, marble-like patterns were exposed on them.

　　The dark clouds were pressing lower and lower, and the wind was blowing harder and harder, and it was clear that a fierce wind and snowstorm was about to arrive. Now, the situation before us is: either the gale and blizzard will stop all the team members, forcing us to return to the first high mountain camp; or seize the time, run ahead of the gale and blizzard, and rush to the second high mountain camp at 6,200 meters above sea level. Strong will told the team members that they should continue to move forward and never retreat! The speed of the march was accelerated, and the number of rests was reduced by two-thirds compared to the previous march. The duration of each rest was also shortened compared to before.

　　After a tenacious struggle, the team members finally completed the journey from the first high mountain camp to the second high mountain camp in more than three hours, shortening the speed by about two hours compared to the previous march. However, after a while, the strong wind and heavy snow turned into a fierce wind and snowstorm. (To be continued)

    登山日记

    和暴风雪搏斗
      7月3日。
    四十多名男、女登山队员经过两次行军锻炼，以及大家对征服慕士塔格山峰的乐观情绪，昨天只经过三个多小时的行军，就从拔海四千五百米的大本营攀登到了拔海五千五百米的第一号高山营地。队员们唱歌的唱歌，煮饭的煮饭，玩扑克的玩扑克，都像生活在平地上一样，没有什么异样的感觉。
    但是，老天仿佛与人作对，它以晴朗的天气把登山队员迎上了“雪线”地区，却又急骤地变得阴沉起来。从昨夜开始，乌云就布满了天空。风雪冲击着慕士塔格山峰，山上山下完全模糊在雪幕之中了。“风暴、冰雪和雷电只能使我们变得更坚强更勇敢！”这几乎已经成为登山队员克服困难的格言。早晨八时半左右，队员们仍然冒雪结组继续前进。
    四十多个人排成长长的行列在雪幕中前进，后面的人看不见前面五十公尺以外的人。大家都无声地进行着，很少休息，前进的速度很快。沿途四十多度的大冰坡、“冰瀑”地区和数不清的裂缝，都一个个安全地通过了。由于前两三天天气忽冷忽热，山上增加了许多积雪融解后又新冻结成的坚硬的冰坡，有的队员穿上绑着“冰爪”的登山靴，仍然几次从这样的冰坡上滑下去，但最后都在互相帮助下攀登了上去。
    西北风越吹越紧，气温在冰点以下，雪花打在脸上疼痛难忍。随着疾速旋转的冷风，雪花钻进队员的脖子里、袖缝里和登山靴里，但是，这一切都不能阻止队员前进。
    雪越下越大，后面的队员已经找不到开路人的脚印，因为脚印很快便被雪填满了。雪越下越大，景致极其壮观的冰瀑地区也完全模糊了。甚至那高大得像三层楼房的雪岩，也只有走到它旁边休息时才看得见。那上面因为经年受到忽冷忽热等多变的气候的影响和雪层陷落，露出了大理石般的采纹。
    黑云越压越低，风越刮越大，眼看狂风暴雪就要来临。现在，摆在我们面前的情况是：或者是狂风暴雪把全体队员阻挡住，迫使我们重新回到第一号高山营地；或者是争取时间，跑在狂风暴雪前面，赶到拔海六千二百米的第二号高山营地。坚强的意志告诉队员们应该继续前进，绝不能后退！行军的速度加快了，休息的次数比上次行军时减少了三分之二。每次的休息时间也比以前缩短了。
    经过顽强的奋战，队员终于以三个多小时的时间，走完了从第一号高山营地到第二号高山营地的路程，比上次行军时的速度缩短了约两个小时。可是，不一会，大风大雪就变成狂风暴雪了。（五续）
