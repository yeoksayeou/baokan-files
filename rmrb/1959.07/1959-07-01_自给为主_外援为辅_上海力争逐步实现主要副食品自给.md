Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 30th. Zhao Disheng and Xu Shoukeng report: Shanghai, a city with a population of nearly seven million, has launched a massive struggle to vigorously develop non-staple food production and strive to gradually achieve self-sufficiency in major non-staple foods within a few years. The city's historical dependence on other regions for the supply of non-staple foods is undergoing a historic change.

    Currently, the city has achieved self-sufficiency in vegetable supply. From January to May this year, the average daily market supply of vegetables has been stable at more than one catty per person, and 840,000 catties of fresh, salted, and dried vegetables have been transferred to support other cities. The production of livestock and poultry is also growing rapidly. According to the data at the end of May: the number of pigs raised in the city has increased to 1.45 million, an increase of 290,000 compared with the end of last year; the number of chickens and ducks raised has reached 4,139,000, a sharp increase of 2,860,000 compared with the end of last year; the number of rabbits, freshwater fish fry, geese, sheep, dairy cows, bees, etc. has also increased.

    Solving the problem of urban non-staple food supply with the spirit of self-reliance as the mainstay and external assistance as a supplement is what the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China determined after analyzing the trend of the ever-growing economic needs of urban and rural people. In particular, since the rural communization and the Great Leap Forward last year, the broad masses of peasants have further demands for improving their lives, and the demand for non-staple foods has increased rapidly. Therefore, under the circumstances that non-staple food production has not yet had time to fully develop, the supply to cities cannot but be reduced. At the same time, with the great development of urban industrial construction and the increase in the number of employed people, the demand for non-staple foods has also increased accordingly. Since the second half of last year, Shanghai's daily demand for vegetables has increased from 35,000 dan to more than 60,000 dan.

    Using the spirit of self-reliance to gradually enable a city as large as Shanghai to achieve self-sufficiency in major non-staple foods within a few years does indeed entail many difficulties. Because the required non-staple foods are numerous and large in quantity, and have always relied on external supply in the past, at the beginning, many cadres did not have a sufficient understanding of this spirit, and its implementation was not firm enough. In vigorously grasping the production of non-staple foods, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China first solved the problem of understanding. The Municipal Party Committee required all cadres to recognize that it is a great good thing for the 500 million peasants to eat more and eat better, and that the resulting reduction in the supply to cities is also unavoidable. Therefore, it is necessary to recognize this change, consciously adapt to this change, resolutely change the old concept of mainly relying on external transfers, and actively engage in the production of non-staple foods, so that after several years of efforts, several major non-staple foods can be gradually self-sufficient item by item. This will not only enable the gradual improvement of the urban non-staple food supply to be established on a reliable basis, but also greatly reduce the long-distance transportation of non-staple foods, saving a large amount of transportation capacity for other more necessary material transportation. The Municipal Party Committee also pointed out that Shanghai has a mild climate and the advantage of rivers, seas, dikes and lakes. Pigs can breed twice a year; ducks can grow up and be marketed in more than 70 days; and suburban farmers have the technical experience in planting vegetables and raising poultry and livestock. Therefore, favorable conditions are available in terms of weather, geography, and people. Facts have proved that as long as attention is paid at all levels and work is grasped tightly and firmly, significant results will appear. Since last autumn and winter, the city has made many efforts in non-staple food production, from vegetables to poultry, livestock, and aquatic products. Therefore, in the case of a substantial reduction in the amount transferred from other regions this year, the city can still do its best to guarantee the supply of vegetables and a certain amount of meat.

    This year, developing non-staple food production has become a major task for the whole people in Shanghai. Now, the problem of vegetable quantity has been solved. Vigorously developing poultry and livestock and various aquatic products is the focus of Shanghai's current work in grasping non-staple foods. The breeding of poultry and livestock is being carried out on three fronts. The first line is the suburbs. This line has the largest number and the fastest progress. The second line is the self-raising of animals by factories, organs, troops, schools and other units throughout the city. According to incomplete statistics, the number of pigs raised by various units has increased to more than 60,000. The third line is state-owned commercial enterprises that vigorously engage in animal husbandry. The various poultry and livestock turnover farms of the Municipal Food Company have raised more than 23,000 pigs and 140,000 poultry, and have developed from the past single turnover farms to livestock farms. The city and counties have also begun to plan and prepare for the construction of a number of state-owned farms.

    No matter which front it is, the breeding work must adopt the principle of simplicity and thrift; advocate poor breeding, not rich breeding. Especially in terms of pig feed, the city is seizing the favorable opportunity in summer to actively tap the source of green and coarse feed. The top-quality green feed water hyacinth on 260,000 mu of water has begun to propagate. Suburban farmers use all available land to plant fine feed such as pumpkins and corn.

    From the city to the commune production team, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the party committees at all levels have dedicated personnel responsible for leading the production of non-staple foods, and corresponding professional institutions and professional teams have also been established from the bottom up. Currently, it is the season for the development and growth of poultry, livestock, and fish fry, and the prosperity of various aquatic products. The professional teams engaged in various non-staple food operations are working hard to carry out nursing work. According to incomplete statistics, the number of professional personnel engaged in poultry and livestock breeding in the suburbs has expanded to more than 50,000, and the number of people engaged in individual breeding is even greater. In terms of aquatic products, in addition to the city and counties having fishing fleets engaged in fishing, a professional team for raising freshwater fish has recently been organized. This year, it is planned to stock 200,000 mu of freshwater water surface, and currently 200 million carp, silver carp and other fish fry have been successively released into ponds for intensive farming. After a series of work since this spring, a strong front for operating poultry, livestock and fish products has been formed in Shanghai.

    自给为主　外援为辅
    上海力争逐步实现主要副食品自给
    据新华社上海30日电　记者赵棣生、徐寿铿报道：市区人口近七百万的上海市，已展开一个大力发展副食品生产，争取在几年内逐步实现主要副食品自给的巨大斗争。全市副食品供应一向依赖外地的局面正在发生历史性的变化。
    目前，全市蔬菜供应已经做到自给。今年1月到5月，蔬菜每天平均上市量稳定在每人一斤以上的水平，并且调出了八十四万斤鲜菜、咸菜、干菜支援其他城市。家畜家禽的产量也正在迅速增长。根据5月底的材料：全市猪的饲养数已发展到一百四十五万头，比去年年底增加二十九万头；鸡鸭饲养数达到四百一十三点九万只，比去年年底猛增二百八十六万只；兔、淡水鱼苗、鹅、羊、奶牛、蜜蜂等的数量，也有所增加。
    以自力更生为主，力争外援为辅的精神解决城市副食品供应问题，是中共上海市委分析了城乡人民经济生活需要不断增长的趋势之后确定的。特别是去年农村公社化和生产大跃进以来，广大农民有了进一步改善生活的要求，对副食品的需要量迅速增加，因而，在副食品生产一时还来不及充分发展的情况下，对城市的供应量不能不有所减少。与此同时，城市工业建设大发展，就业人数增加，对副食品的需要量也随着增多。上海自去年下半年以来，每天需要的蔬菜就由三万五千担上升到六万担以上。
    用自力更生精神，逐步使上海这样大的城市在几年内做到主要副食品自给，困难确实不少。因为所需副食品的品种既多，数量又大，过去一向依靠外地供应，所以在最初的时候，不少干部对这一精神认识不足，贯彻得不够坚决。中共上海市委在大抓副食品生产中，首先就来解决认识问题。市委要求所有干部认识五亿农民吃多点、吃好点是很大的好事，由此而影响城市的供应量减少也是不可避免的。因此，要承认这一变化，自觉地适应这一变化，坚决改变主要依靠外地调运的旧观念，积极大搞副食品生产，以便经过几年努力，使若干种主要副食品能够逐项地逐步地实现自给。这样做，不但可以使城市副食品供应状况的逐步改善建立在可靠的基础上，而且可以大大减少副食品的远距离调运，节省出大批交通运输力量来从事其他更必要的物资运输。市委还指出，上海气候温和，兼有江河海塘湖滨之利。猪一年可以繁殖两季；鸭子七十多天可长成上市；市郊农民又有种植蔬菜和饲养禽畜的技术经验。因此，天时地利人和，具备各种有利条件。事实证明，只要层层重视，抓紧抓狠，就会出现显著效果。从去年秋冬以来，全市副食品生产，由菜蔬到禽畜水产，都已作了不少努力。因而在今年外地调入量大为减少的情况下，全市仍能尽力保证了菜蔬和一定数量肉食的供应。
    今年，发展副食品生产在上海已成为一项全民动手的重大任务。现在，菜蔬数量问题已经解决。大力发展家禽家畜和各种水产，是当前上海大抓副食品工作中的重点。家禽家畜的饲养正在三条战线上展开。第一线是郊区。这一线数量最大，进展最快。第二线是全市工厂、机关、部队、学校等单位实行自养。据不完全统计，各单位养猪头数已发展到六万头以上。第三线是国营商业大抓畜牧经营。市食品公司各禽畜周转场已自养生猪二万三千多头，家禽十四万只，由过去的单
  一的周转场向畜牧厂方向发展。市、县也开始规划和筹建一批国营农场。
    不论哪一条战线，饲养工作都要采取因陋就简、节约俭省的原则；提倡穷养，不靠富养。特别是生猪饲料方面，全市正抓紧夏季有利时机，积极挖掘青粗饲料来源。二十六万亩水面的上等青饲料水浮莲已经开始繁殖。市郊农民利用一切可以利用的土地种上了南瓜、玉米等精饲料。
    从市一直到公社生产队，中共上海市委和各级党委都有专人专责领导副食品生产工作，相应的专业机构和专业队伍也已从下到上建立起来。目前正是禽畜鱼苗发育生长、各种水产繁盛兴旺的季节，从事各种副食品经营的专业队伍正在紧张进行护养工作。据不完全统计，郊区从事家禽家畜饲养的专业人员已扩大到五万多人，从事个人饲养的为数更大。水产方面，除了市、县有渔轮队从事捕捞以外，新近又组织了饲养淡水鱼的专业队，今年准备放养的淡水水面有二十万亩，目前已有二亿尾鲤、鲢等鱼苗陆续放塘精养。经过今春以来一系列的工作，上海市一条强大的经营禽畜鱼产的阵线已经形成。
