    Adapting to Individual Needs
    To train teachers, we must adopt diversified methods tailored to individual needs, just as Jishan County and Chongqing City have done, in order to achieve the expected results.
    The great development of China's education requires a large number of high-quality teachers. This is one aspect. On the other hand, under this general requirement, there are also differences. We don't just need one type of teacher, but a variety of teachers: some are middle school teachers, some are primary school teachers; some are teachers in urban schools, some are teachers in rural schools; some are teachers in public schools, some are teachers in private schools. There should be different requirements for these teachers in different schools. For these different schools and different teachers, it is even more necessary to adapt to individual needs. Their individual original foundations are different, and their work experience and conditions are also different. If we do not adopt the method of adapting to individual needs and prescribing the right medicine, we will not achieve our goals. We must strive to be like the teachers in Jishan County who said after studying: "After studying, we have great confidence, high motivation, and the quality of teaching is getting better every day." We must greatly promote the method of adapting to individual needs and cultivate more teachers suitable for the great development of education.

    因人制宜
    培训教师，要像稷山县、重庆市这样，采取因人制宜、多种多样的办法，才能收到预期的效果。
    我国教育事业的大发展，需要量多质好的教师，这是一方面。另一方面，在这个总的要求下，又有差别，不是只需要一种教师，而是需要多种多样的教师：有的是中学教师，有的是小学教师；有的是城市学校的教师，有的是农村学校的教师；有的是公立学校的教师，有的是民办学校的教师。对于这些不同学校的教师，应当有不同的要求。从这些不同学校不同教师来说，更需要因人制宜了。他们个人原来的基础不同，工作经验和条件也不同。如果不采取因人制宜、对症下药的办法，那就会达不到目的。要像稷山县有的教师在学习以后所说的那样：学习后，信心大，干劲高，教学质量天天好。我们要大大提倡因人制宜的方法，培养出更多适合教育事业大发展所需要的教师来。
