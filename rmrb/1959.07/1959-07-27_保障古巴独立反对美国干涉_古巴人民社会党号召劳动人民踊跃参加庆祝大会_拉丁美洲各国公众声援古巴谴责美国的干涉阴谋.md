Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 25th: The Cuban Popular Socialist Party issued a letter to the working people to celebrate the sixth anniversary of the July 26th Movement. It called on workers, employees, freelancers, intellectuals, students, etc., in Havana to actively participate in the million-person celebration rally held near the Plaza Civica in Havana.

    The letter pointed out that this mass rally, with the participation of 500,000 farmers, should demonstrate the revolutionary will and action of the Cuban people, as well as their unwavering determination. The letter to the people stated that the Cuban people are determined to fully implement land reform; to safeguard the independence of the motherland, oppose all imperialist pressure and aggression, and crush the heinous counter-revolutionary conspiracies of the Batista and Trujillo elements; to realize the revolutionary program and support the revolutionary government; and to have the revolutionary leader Fidel Castro withdraw his resignation and resume the post of Prime Minister through a genuine civic vote. Referring to the mutual support between urban and rural areas reflected in this conference, the letter emphasized the importance of strengthening the worker-peasant alliance. It believes that the worker-peasant alliance is a decisive factor in combating the enemies of the revolution, thoroughly completing the ongoing land reform, and victoriously building a new Cuba of freedom, democracy, and progress desired by the people.

    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 25th: Blas Roca, General Secretary of the Cuban Popular Socialist Party, delivered a speech to the Cuban people on the radio today.

    Roca pointed out that farmers, workers, and citizens of all strata will solemnly warn the enemies of the revolution at home and abroad at tomorrow's conference that they are prepared to do whatever it takes to defend and advance the revolution until final victory. Roca said that if US imperialism colludes with the Trujillo elements and Batista counter-revolutionaries to take sinful violent actions, then they should listen, tomorrow's conference will tell them that they will be met with a devastating counterattack. Counter-revolutionary violent actions will be countered by revolutionary violent actions, and they will be resisted not only by the brave and battle-hardened rebel army, but also by the entire people. Any sabotage or attack by the enemy will be crushed.

    Roca continued by saying that the enemies of the revolution are doing everything possible to undermine Cuba's economy, attempting to make the Cuban people yield. Roca pointed out that the mass participation and enthusiasm displayed by the Cuban people at tomorrow's grand rally will tell them that they are completely wrong, and the Cuban people are prepared to make any sacrifice to carry out the land reform to the end, develop national industries, change the semi-colonial economic structure, and achieve Cuba's economic independence.

    Roca said that the enemies of the revolution may provoke new betrayals like those of Diaz Lanz and Urrutia, trying to stab the revolution in the back with insidious daggers. But they should know that the entire people oppose traitors and fully support Castro.

    In his speech, Roca thanked the representatives of the people of Latin American countries who will attend the conference and bring the support of their brotherly peoples.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, 26th: Political organizations and mass groups in Latin American countries are launching a movement to support Cuba and oppose US interference.

    Argentina formed a "Committee to Support the Republic of Cuba" on the 22nd. Participants in the committee included the youth organizations of the Progressive Democratic Party, the Intransigent Radical Civic Union, and the Communist Party, the Federation of the University of Buenos Aires, the Federation of Secondary School Students, and leaders of other youth organizations.

    The statement issued by the committee said that Argentine youth and all the organizations that signed the statement "guarantee to defend the Cuban revolution as they would defend their own revolution, and demand that the national youth and people provide support to expose the faces of international reactionary forces attempting to infringe upon Cuban sovereignty."

    The committee decided to: hold a mass rally on the 26th to support the Cuban revolution, and launch a movement to support Cuba against aggression; initiate a solidarity movement with the participation of various groups and prominent figures to express opposition to interference in Cuba's internal affairs to the meeting of foreign ministers of the American countries to be held in Chile; organize a youth volunteer army to prepare to fight in Cuba if Cuba is subjected to aggression.

    According to a recent report in the Cuban "Revolución," political and mass organizations in El Salvador decided to organize a series of rallies and demonstrations from July 20 to 26 to support the Cuban people who are under threat of foreign interference.

    In Chile, the host country of the upcoming meeting of foreign ministers of the American countries, the Chilean People's Action Front, including the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and four other parties, and other organizations, are preparing to launch a mass movement to support Cuba and Venezuela and oppose imperialist interference in these two countries under the guise of "opposing communism."

    According to the Colombian "Democracia" newspaper on the 25th, the press in Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and Mexico condemned interference in Cuba's internal affairs. The newspaper said, "Faced with the US interventionist conspiracy, an international solidarity movement is flourishing."
