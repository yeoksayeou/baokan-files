Since the National Forestry Conference last year issued the call to turn oil production towards woody plants, walnut seedling cultivation in Pinggu County, a suburb of Beijing, has developed rapidly. Last autumn and this spring, more than 3,000 mu of walnuts were sown, accounting for half of the total walnut seedling cultivation area in the city.

Pinggu County's achievement is inseparable from the importance attached to this work by local leaders. Wang Wenzhe, the First Secretary of the Pinggu County Party Committee, personally took charge, frequently going to the seedling fields in various communes to supervise and inspect, and promptly solve major problems such as manpower and land. The 1.2 million jin of walnut seeds sown in the county were all produced locally. In order to propagate walnuts, the communes sowed walnuts worth several tens of thousands of yuan in the seedling fields.

Walnut seedling cultivation in Pinggu is distributed in five communes throughout the county, with Hanzhuang Commune cultivating the most. The land for seedling cultivation is selected to be relatively good land, and professional teams are organized to be responsible for management.

In terms of technical guidance, the county's Agriculture and Forestry Bureau assigned a technical cadre in each commune's technical station to be responsible for technical guidance, resulting in a high emergence rate. The average emergence rate for the county's 3,180 mu of walnuts is 57.6%.

The walnut seedlings in various nurseries have now been loosened and weeded once, and the seedlings are growing strong, averaging 25 centimeters in height.

    平谷培育核桃苗又多又好
    本报讯　自去年全国林业会议提出今后油料木本化的号召以后，北京市郊平谷县的核桃育苗发展很快，去秋今春共播种核桃三千多亩，占全市核桃育苗总面积的一半。
    平谷县取得这样的成绩是和当地领导重视这项工作分不开的。平谷县委第一书记王文哲亲自挂帅，经常深入各公社苗田督促检查，及时解决人力，土地等主要问题。这个县播种使用的一百二十万斤核桃种子都是本县自产的。各公社为了繁植核桃，把可以卖几万元的核桃播在苗地上。
    平谷核桃育苗分布在全县的五个公社，韩庄公社育的最多，育苗的土地都是选择较好的土地，同时组织了专业队负责经营。
    在技术指导上，这个县农林局在每个公社的技术站中都确定一名技术干部负责技术指导，因此出苗率很高，全县三千一百八十亩核桃，平均出苗率57.6％。
    现在各苗圃的核桃都已普遍松土和除草一次，幼苗生长健壮，平均高二十五公分。
