Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th. In Guangdong's disaster areas, the dikes and various water conservancy projects washed away by floods are being rapidly repaired. As of the 14th, more than one million cubic meters of earthwork had been completed in the Dongjiang River downstream area's embankment closure project, which is more than one-third of the planned project volume. More than ten thousand small-scale water conservancy projects, such as mountain ponds, reservoirs, and hillside canals, have been repaired. Dongguan County has made the fastest progress, having repaired eight of the ten dikes washed away. More than half of the embankment closure project in Zengcheng County has also been completed.

During the flood's onslaught, cadres and the masses in the coastal areas of Guangdong fought fiercely against the flood. All major dikes along the Xijiang and Beijiang rivers were secured, with only a few small enclosures collapsing. In the Dongjiang River downstream area, due to being hit by an unprecedentedly large flood, most of the dikes eventually collapsed and caused disasters due to the flood overtopping. Among them, the most severely affected counties in the Dongjiang River downstream area, such as Huiyang, Boluo, Zengcheng, and Dongguan, had eighty-one large and small dikes washed away, with more than three hundred breaches. Considering that after the summer floods, the typhoon and rain season in autumn might bring floods again, and that there was excessive rainfall in the first half of the year, it is also likely that there will be drought in the second half of the year. Many small-scale water conservancy projects such as mountain ponds, reservoirs, and hillside canals were washed away by mountain floods in various places. Therefore, closing breaches in the dikes and repairing water conservancy projects has become the primary task for the disaster areas to restore production and strive for a bumper late harvest. As soon as the flood prevention, rescue and disaster relief work in various disaster areas ended, the Party committees at all levels immediately helped the victims arrange their lives, and at the same time established command organizations to actively deploy the closure of breaches in dikes and carry out mass movements to rush repair small water conservancy projects. The central government and the province have also allocated a large amount of funds and materials to support the local people in closing breaches in dikes.

In counties such as Huiyang, Boluo, Dongguan, and Zengcheng, more than 60,000 migrant workers were organized to go to the dikes to rush to close the breaches in the dikes as soon as the floods receded in late June. Party secretaries and cadres at all levels in various places eat, live, and work with the migrant workers on the dikes, repairing the dikes day and night. The members of the Gutang Brigade of the Luzhou Commune in Huiyang County transported an average of 3.7 cubic meters of earth per person per day during the closure of the dikes, which is nearly double the quota. When the breach in Tangtou, Guancheng Commune, Dongguan County, was about to close, the water was rapid, and the grass bags were washed away by the water as soon as they were thrown down. More than 20 migrant workers saw this situation and immediately jumped into the water to block the rapids with their bodies, and then quickly dropped the grass bags to close the breach. The masses in Heyuan County, under the leadership of cadres, rushed to repair and restored more than 1,900 projects such as mountain ponds, reservoirs, and dams in four days.

The officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army who supported the closure of the dikes in the Dongjiang River area had even stronger fighting spirit. The soldiers of the Second Company of a certain unit participating in the construction of Guanghe enclosure in Huiyang County launched a "more loading, faster running" campaign, transporting 3.3 cubic meters of earth per person per day. The officers and soldiers participating in the construction of Yuanzhou enclosure in Boluo County overcame all difficulties and insisted on driving piles and laying stones in deep water to close the breach ahead of schedule. Hu Jicheng, a major general of the troops, personally came to the construction site in the heavy rain to direct the repair work. The masses in the disaster area said with infinite gratitude: When the flood came, the army rescued our lives. When the flood receded, the army came to help us repair the dikes again. This kindness can never be told by future generations.

Now, the battle to close the breaches in the dikes and repair water conservancy projects in the disaster area is still continuing. All localities are striving to complete the work of closing the breached dikes and repairing small-scale water conservancy projects before the summer planting to strive for a bumper late harvest.

    广东灾区抢修水利力争晚造丰收
    东江下游堵口复堤工程完成一百多万土方，山塘水库修复一万多处
    新华社广州16日电　广东灾区被洪水冲崩了的堤围和各种水利工程，正在迅速修复。到14日止，东江下游地区的堵口复堤工程已经完成了一百多万土方，即完成了计划工程量的三分之一以上。山塘、水库和坡圳等小型水利已修复了一万多宗，其中进度最快的东莞县，被冲崩的十个堤围已经修复了八个。增城县的堵复工程，也已完成了一半以上。
    在洪水侵袭期间，广东沿江地区干部和群众同洪水进行了激烈的搏斗。西江、北江两岸主要堤围全部确保下来，仅有个别小围崩决。东江下游地区，因为受到了百年未有的特大洪水袭击，大部分堤围终因洪水漫顶而崩决成灾。其中受灾最重的东江下游惠阳、博罗、增城、东莞等县，被洪水冲崩的大小堤围即有八十一个，决口三百多处。鉴于夏季洪水过后，到秋季的台风雨季节，洪水还可能再来，同时，上半年雨水过多，下半年也很可能出现干旱，各地都有不少山塘、水库和坡头、水圳等小型水利工程被山洪冲崩。因此，堵口复堤和修复水利工程，就成为灾区恢复生产夺取晚造丰收的首要任务。各灾区抗洪抢险和抢救灾民的工作刚一结束，各级党委即一面帮助灾民安排生活，一面成立指挥机构，积极部署堵口复堤和开展群众性的抢修小型水利工程运动。中央和省也拨出大批经费和物资支援当地人民堵口复堤。
    惠阳、博罗、东莞、增城等县，6月下旬洪水一退就组织了六万多民工上堤，突击堵口复堤。各地党委书记和各级干部，都在堤上和民工同食、同住、同劳动，日夜抢修堤围。惠阳县芦州公社古塘大队的社员们在堵口复堤中，平均每人每天运土三点七方，超过定额近一倍。东莞县莞城公社的塘头决口在快要合拢的时候，水势湍急，草包丢下去一下子就被水冲跑，有二十多个民工看见这种情况，马上跳下水去，用自己的身体堵住急流，然后迅速丢下草包把决口堵住。河源县的群众，在干部带领下突击抢修，四天内就修复了山塘、水库、堤坝等工程一千九百多宗。
    支援东江地区复堤堵口的中国人民解放军官兵，斗志更旺。参加修筑惠阳县广和围的某部二连的战士们，开展了“多装快跑”运动，每人每天运土三点三立方。参加修筑博罗县元洲围的官兵，克服一切困难，坚持在深水中打桩下石，提前把决口堵住。部队首长胡继成少将曾经冒着大雨亲临工地指挥抢修工作。灾区群众无限感激地说：洪水来了，大军抢救我们的生命，洪水退了，大军又来帮助我们修堤。这种恩情子孙万代都说不完。
    现在，灾区堵口复堤和修复水利工程的战斗还在继续进行，各地力争在夏种前完成堵复堤围修复小型水利的工作，争取晚造丰收。（附图片）
