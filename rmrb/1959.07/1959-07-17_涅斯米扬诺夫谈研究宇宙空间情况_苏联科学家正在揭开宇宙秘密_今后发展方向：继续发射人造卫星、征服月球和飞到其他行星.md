Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th – The “Pravda” and “Izvestia” newspapers on the 15th published a two-page report by the President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Nesmeyanov, on the results of cosmic space research. At the same time, under the title "Cosmic Secrets are Being Unveiled," they published a large amount of material and conclusions obtained by Soviet scientists in the study of the upper atmosphere and cosmic space.

Nesmeyanov's report was delivered at the plenary session of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in March of this year. He first pointed out that almost every scientific department in the Soviet Union has participated in the research of cosmic space, and the high integration of science and technology has brought great achievements. In the near future, cosmic flight research will develop along three directions: continuing to launch artificial Earth satellites, conquering the moon, and flying to other planets. He then said that the further development direction of satellite manufacturing is to expand the scope of scientific research and rely on satellites to solve some purely practical tasks.

Nesmeyanov said that it is conceivable that in the future (perhaps not in the very near future), people can land on the moon and then return to Earth. At the same time, he emphasized that it is a rather complex problem to make instruments land on the lunar surface, and it is not an easy task to take off from the moon and return to Earth.

In the more distant future, during the conquest of the moon, people may consider establishing special scientific stations on the moon, just like the scientific stations that people have established in some hard-to-reach areas on Earth.

Speaking of studying other planets in the solar system, Nesmeyanov said that people's targets are primarily Venus and Mars, and such research is very interesting. People will launch rockets to these planets at a time when their relative positions to Earth are suitable for launching rockets with the least amount of energy.

Nesmeyanov then pointed out that the development of space flight is the newest field in human activity, which places the strictest demands on science and technology. It seems that those plans that are still fantasies and unattainable today will be realized much sooner than people imagine. He is confident that we will all be witnesses to new brilliant achievements in conquering the universe.

According to Nesmeyanov's report, the newspapers published some materials specifically elaborating on the Soviet Union's research in cosmic space.

First of all, in these materials, one can find the conclusion that in interplanetary space, cosmic rays will not have particularly harmful effects on the bodies of future space travelers. This conclusion is based on the materials provided by the cosmic rocket launched on January 2, 1959. However, given the high intensity of cosmic radiation in the vicinity of the Earth, when spacecraft approach the Earth or other planets, the danger of high-speed particles bombarding the spacecraft's hull should be taken into account. This bombardment may cause radioactive diseases in living organisms. According to the materials obtained, it has been proven that it is possible to prevent radiation effects, although this protection equipment requires the spacecraft itself to have a greater weight. At the same time, a large amount of protection equipment is also needed in the inner layers of the atmosphere where particle energy is very high. Therefore, it can be considered that the trajectory of the rockets that future astronauts ride in should not continue too long in the inner layers of the atmosphere.

The materials point out that through the launching of artificial satellites and rockets, Soviet scientists have, for the first time, confidently confirmed the atmospheric density at an altitude of 600 to 800 kilometers.

Existing materials prove that many of the concepts about the atmosphere that existed before the satellite launch were wrong.

The current conclusion is that at an altitude of 226 kilometers to at least 800 kilometers, atomic oxygen is the basic gaseous component, and the ionosphere depends on its existence. In addition to ions of atomic oxygen, ions of atomic nitrogen were also recorded. At the same time, heavy particles that help solve the problem of the ionization balance of the upper atmosphere were also discovered at an altitude of 350 kilometers.

Soviet scientists determined that the intensity of cosmic radiation increases and changes with the distance from the Earth. At a distance from the Earth equivalent to four Earth radii, its intensity reaches its peak, increasing a hundredfold. But as it extends outward, the intensity sharply weakens, and beyond a distance equivalent to ten Earth radii, cosmic radiation reaches the general normal state in interplanetary space.

The materials provided by the instruments of the Soviet cosmic rocket prove that the distribution materials on the outer layer of space are consistent with the newly obtained materials on the charged particles in this region. The maximum actual energy of electrons in this region is about 25,000 electron volts, while the electron energy in its marginal region is nearly 50,000 electron volts. Different from the outer layer of the atmosphere, high-energy particles were found in the inner layer of the atmosphere. According to the materials obtained from the third artificial satellite, these particles are protons with an energy of 100 million electron volts.

Based on the research of cosmic space using artificial satellites and rockets, the following conclusions can be drawn: if atomic explosion fallout enters the high altitude, they will form a strong charged particle flow there. And because the energy of these particles is small, they will be "locked" in the Earth's magnetic field, this so-called large "collector." Therefore, Soviet scientists believe that atomic explosions will "contaminate" the cosmic space near the Earth.

    涅斯米扬诺夫谈研究宇宙空间情况
    苏联科学家正在揭开宇宙秘密
    今后发展方向：继续发射人造卫星、征服月球和飞到其他行星
    新华社莫斯科16日电　15日“真理报”和“消息报”以两版的篇幅发表了苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫关于宇宙空间研究结果的报告，同时，以“宇宙的秘密正在揭开”为题，刊载了大批苏联科学家在研究大气高层和宇宙空间方面所获得的材料和结论。
    涅斯米扬诺夫的报告是今年3月在苏联科学院全体会议上发表的。他首先指出，在苏联几乎没有一个科学部门没有参加宇宙空间的研究工作，科学和技术的高度综合带来了巨大的成就。在最近的将来，宇宙飞行的研究工作将沿着这样三个方向发展：继续发射人造地球卫星、征服月球和飞到其他行星上去。他接着说，制造卫星工作的进一步的发展方向是：扩大科学研究的范围和依靠卫星来解决一些纯粹实用的任务。
    涅斯米扬诺夫说，可以想像，在今后（可能不是在很近的未来），人可以在月球上降落，然后再返回地球。同时，他强调指出，要使仪器在月球表面上降落是一个相当复杂的问题，而且要从月球再起飞返回地球也并不是很容易解决的任务。
    在更远一些的未来，人在征服月球的过程中可能考虑要在月球上建立特别的科学站，这些科学站就像人们在地球上一些难以到达的地区所建立的科学站一样。
  涅斯米扬诺夫在谈到研究太阳系的其他行星时说，人们的对象首先是金星和火星，而这种研究是非常有趣的。人们将会在这样的时间内向这些行星发射火箭，即，当它们和地球之间的相互位置适合于利用最少的能量发射火箭的时候。
    涅斯米扬诺夫接着指出，发展宇宙飞行是人类活动中的一个最新的领域，它对科学和技术提出了最严格的要求，看来那些今天都还是幻想和不能实现的计划，将来会实现得比人们所想像的早得多。他确信，我们大家都会是在征服宇宙中获得新的辉煌成就的见证人。
    根据涅斯米扬诺夫的报告，报纸刊载了具体阐述苏联在研究宇宙空间方面的一些材料。
    首先，在这些材料中可以找到这样的一个结论，即在行星际空间，宇宙线对未来的宇宙旅行者的身体将不会产生特别有害的影响，这是根据1959年1月2日发射的宇宙火箭所提供的材料得出的结论。但是鉴于在地球附近区域宇宙辐射强度很大，所以当宇宙飞船在接近地球或其他行星附近时，应该估计到运动速度很高的粒子轰击飞船船身的危险。这种轰击可能给生物机体带来放射性疾病。根据获得的材料证明，要防止辐射影响是可能做到的，尽管这种防御设备要求宇宙飞船本身具有更大的重量。同时，在粒子能量很大的大气内层，也需要重量很大的防护设备，由此可以认为，未来宇宙飞行者所乘坐的火箭的弹道不能在大气内层中延续过久。
    材料指出，苏联科学家通过发射人造卫星和火箭，第一次有把握地肯定了六百—八百公里高空的大气密度。
    现有的材料证明，在卫星发射前存在着的一系列关于大气的概念，有不少是错误的。
    目前的结论是，在从二百二十六公里到至少是八百公里的高空中，原子态氧是基本的气体成分，电离层就依赖于它而存在。除了原子态氧的离子以外，原子态氮的离子也被记录了下来。同时，在三百五十公里的高空还发现了有助于解决大气高层电离平衡问题的重粒子。
    苏联科学家确定，宇宙辐射的强度随距离地球的远近不同而有所增长和变化，在距离地球相当于四个地球半径的时候，它的强度达到了顶峰，即增大了一百倍，但再向外伸展时，强度便猛然减弱，在相当十个地球半径的距离之外，宇宙辐射就达到了在行星际空间的一般常态。
    苏联宇宙火箭的仪器所提供的材料证明，关于空间外层的分布材料是与新获得的这一区域中带电粒子构成的材料相符合的。在这个区域中的电子的最大实际能量是二万五千电子伏特左右，而在其边缘区域的电子能量则将近五万电子伏特。与大气外层相区别的是，在大气内层中发现了能量很高的粒子。根据第三个人造卫星获得的材料证明，这些粒子是具有能量达一亿电子伏特的质子。
    在利用人造卫星和火箭对宇宙空间所作的研究的基础上，可以得出如下结论：如果原子爆炸的散落物进入高空时，它们就会在那里形成很强的带电粒子流。而因为这些粒子的能量小，所以它们会被“锁”在地球磁场这个所谓大的“捕集器”中。因此，苏联科学家们认为，原子爆炸将会“沾污”了地球附近的宇宙空间。
