Letting Agricultural Machinery Take Root Locally
--Notes on the Experience of Baiquan County Farmers in Reforming Tractor-Drawn Implements
By our reporter Jiao Huadong

Speaking of agricultural mechanization, people often think, when using tractors for cultivation, can we absorb the good farming experiences and methods suitable for local conditions? This question has already been answered in Baiquan County, Heilongjiang.

Farmers in Baiquan County began using tractors in 1953. Now tractors are owned by the communes and operated by the management areas. The farmers treat the tractors with the same care and affection as they do their cattle and horses. However, in the process of using them, problems have arisen: the set of tractor-drawn implements, such as tractor-drawn plows, disc harrows, rollers, and seeders, are all foreign and only suitable for cultivation on flat land. They are not suitable for the ridge planting that has long been customary in Heilongjiang, and ridge planting is formed over a long period according to local natural conditions. It has its scientific and rational side, and cannot be overthrown wholesale. For example, the temperature here is low year-round, and spring is relatively dry and windy, while summer and autumn have heavy rainfall. Because ridged cultivated land has a larger surface area in contact with sunlight and air than flat land, it is very beneficial for increasing soil temperature. It preserves moisture and prevents good soil from being blown away by the wind in the spring, and in the rainy summer and autumn, the ridges act as drainage channels. Therefore, this cultivation method has a great effect on increasing the yield of large autumn crops with longer maturity periods. Of course, "ridge planting" is not unchangeable. After the farmers of Baiquan County implemented mechanized farming, they changed the original "ridge planting" of spring wheat to "flat planting," and generally increased production by about 20%; however, when large autumn crops were changed to "flat planting," some did not increase production, and some even decreased production. Thus, the following situation arose: only one-quarter of the county's cultivated land planted with spring wheat could be plowed and sown with agricultural machinery, while the other three-quarters of the cultivated land planted with large autumn crops still had to be cultivated with old-fashioned farm implements. Every spring plowing and summer hoeing season, strong male laborers would hold old-fashioned curved plows, drive livestock to ridge and cultivate the land, working from dawn till dusk, and still not finish planting until half a month after the sowing season, and wanting to cultivate three times during summer hoeing, they could only cultivate twice; however, at that time, the tractors were anxiously waiting on the side, unable to exert their strength, and had to remain idle except for hauling with trailers. The farmers said, "How can we put good steel to good use?"

This contradiction between agricultural machinery and local traditional farming methods has been encountered in many places. Should we change the farming methods wholesale to give full play to the effectiveness of the tools, or should we reform the tools according to the farming methods suitable for local conditions? According to the instructions from higher authorities, the Baiquan County Committee of the Communist Party of China, in addition to changing crops that can be flat-planted to flat planting to give full play to mechanical efficiency, also led farmers to actively improve and create tractor-drawn implements suitable for "ridge planting."

The work of reforming tractor-drawn implements in Baiquan County started in 1957. In the process of reform, on the one hand, the provincial agricultural science research department and the county's machinery factory carried out some reform experiments to help farmers solve some problems. On the other hand, the Baiquan County Committee of the Communist Party of China also mobilized the masses of farmers to carry out reforms. The first person to create a simple tractor-drawn tool that could be hung on the back of a tractor for cultivation and officially applied to the land of "ridge planting" of large autumn crops was Qin Yukun, secretary of the Xingye Agricultural Cooperative Party Branch, and the masses around him. In 1957, Qin Yukun spent more than two months keeping company with the tractor, working and repairing it, staying beside the tractor all day long. This Party branch secretary, who had never seen a tractor before, learned to drive and do simple repairs, and at the same time, understood the tractor's temperament. He cooperated with tractor drivers and organized many farmers to conduct experiments together. At first, they used a thick and long wooden pole to tie several curved plows and hang them horizontally behind the tractor to plant the land for large autumn crops. Later, after the Baiquan County Committee of the Communist Party of China mobilized the masses to further research and experiment, it was quickly promoted throughout the county. More than one thousand farmers, more than six hundred tractor drivers, and more than one hundred rural iron and wood craftsmen became reform experts, and various "ridge planting" tractor-drawn implements appeared one after another.

In the spring of 1958, thirty-four tractors in the county were equipped with a large number of curved plows, and thirty-two mechanized farming cooperatives finished planting the land for large autumn crops half a month earlier. However, the members who followed the tractor holding the plows raised a question: how can people rely on two legs to walk and hold the plow to keep up with the tractor? The tractor was driving very slowly, and the people behind it were still panting from exhaustion, and the efficiency of the tractor was not well utilized. What to do? Not long after, when it was time for summer hoeing, the Zhongxing Agricultural Cooperative came up with a new method. They converted the flower wheel cart into a "old plow support cart" and hung it together with the curved plow behind the tractor for hoeing. On this cart, small wooden benches were installed according to the number of old plows, and people sat on the small wooden benches to hold the plows. The tractor exerted even greater efficiency.

Baiquan County has such a saying: "Plant on the plow, harvest on the hoe." Hoeing is an important measure to increase production, but it must be carried out in coordination with shoveling. With the increased number of hoeing passes in the mechanized farming cooperatives, more people were needed to hold the plows, and the number of people shoveling the land was relatively reduced. Even with the mobilization of men, women, and children, they could not shovel the land four times. This again required freeing the people sitting on the carts holding the plows from behind the tractor. Thus, an even larger-scale movement to reform tractor-drawn implements was launched throughout the county. This spring plowing season, farmers took out newly reformed and created "ridge planting seeders," "suspended three-purpose five-share plows," "towed cultivating five-share plows," and so on, and a large number of plow-holding laborers were freed from behind the tractors. The most ingenious is the "ridge planting seeder," which not only reduces the labor of ridging and holding the plow, but also sows and ridges at the same time, combining the two processes of sowing and ridging into one. In this way, the old farm implements originally hung behind the tractor for cultivation and the foreign agricultural machinery were combined. The old farm implements were transformed from "native" to "foreign," undergoing a qualitative change, and became new tractor-drawn implements that met the requirements of "ridge planting."

The creation of the farmers in Baiquan County not only solves some current practical problems, but its far-reaching significance lies in the fact that they have provided a blueprint for agricultural scientific research departments to solve "ridge planting" farm implements, which is of great significance for the future manufacture of more complete "ridge planting" farm implements.

In the early years, Baiquan County used only curved plows, curved hoes, and curved sickles for cultivation. The land was vast and the population was small, and the tools were clumsy, resulting in sloppy planting. At that time, they planted on old ridges, some simply turning the old ridge platforms into new ridge ditches, and some simply opening a small ditch on the old ridge platforms to plant seeds. Now, they are using new farm implements. Because they save labor and produce more output, they have the strength to completely change the old cultivation situation. The land is still the same, and the population has not increased much, but they have already been able to cultivate deeply and meticulously. This year, the wheat and soybeans, which account for about one-third of the cultivated area in Baiquan County, have been carefully prepared, plowed, harrowed, rolled, and pressed several times to make the land flat and fine. The remaining two-thirds of the cultivated land for large autumn crops is still "ridge planting," but most of this "ridge planting" is no longer planting on old ridges, but ridging again after the land is leveled and refined. The concept of "ridge planting" has been replaced with new content. (Attached picture)

    让农业机械在当地生根
    ——记拜泉县农民改革拖带农具的经验
    本报记者　焦化东
    一提起农业机械化，人们常常会想到，用拖拉机耕作，能不能吸取适合当地条件的好的耕作经验和好的耕作方法？这个问题，已经在黑龙江拜泉县得到了回答。
    拜泉县农民是从1953年开始使用拖拉机的。现在拖拉机是归公社所有，由管理区经营使用。农民群众对待拖拉机，就像侍弄牛马一样，又关心又喜爱。但在使用过程中，却出现了这样的问题：它所拖带的那一套机引农具，像机引犁、圆盘耙、镇压器和播种机等等，都是外来的，只适用于在平整的土地上耕作，不适于黑龙江长期习惯的起垅种地，而垅作又是根据当地自然条件长期形成的，有它科学的、合理的一面，不能一古脑推翻。比如这里长年气温较低，春季比较干旱、风大，而夏秋雨水又大。因为起垅的耕地，接触阳光和空气的地面都比平整的土地大，对提高地温很有利。它在春季保墒，阻挡地面的好土被风吹走；而在夏秋多雨的时候，垅沟又代替了排水道。所以这种耕作方法，对成熟期较长的大秋作物有很大的增产作用。当然“垅作”也不是不可改变的，拜泉县农民实行机耕以后，把原来“垅作”的春麦改为
  “平作”，一般都增产20％左右；可是大秋作物改为“平作”，有的不增产，有的还要减产。这样，就出现了这样的情况：全县只有四分之一种春麦的耕地，可以用农业机械翻地、播种，而另四分之三播种的大秋作物的耕地，仍然要用旧式农具耕作。每到春耕、夏锄时候，强壮的男劳动力扶着旧式弯钩犁、赶着牲口起垅和趟地，起早贪黑，播种期过后半个月还种不完，夏锄时想趟三遍，也只能趟上两遍；可是，那时候拖拉机却在旁边干着急，有劲使不上，除了挂上拖车搞点运输以外，就得闲起来。农民说：“怎样才能把好钢使在刀刃上呢？”
    这种农业机械和当地传统的耕作方法的矛盾，在很多地方都遇到了。是一古脑改变耕作方法来发挥工具效能呢，还是依照适合当地条件的耕作方法来改革工具呢？中共拜泉县委根据上级的指示，除把可以平作的作物改为平作，以充分发挥机械效率外，又领导农民积极改良和创造适合于拖拉机拖带的“垅作”的机引农具。
    拜泉县拖带农具的改革工作，从1957年开始的。在改革的过程中，一方面有省的农业科学研究部门和县的机械厂，作了一些改革试验，帮助农民解决一些问题。而另一方面，中共拜泉县委也发动了农民群众进行改革。第一个制造出一种简便的挂在拖拉机后面，就可以进行耕作的拖带工具，并在“垅作”大秋作物的土地上正式应用的，是兴业农业社党支部书记秦玉坤和他周围的群众。1957年，秦玉坤足足用了两个多月的时间跟拖拉机作伴，跟班作业，跟班修理，整天守在拖拉机旁边。这个不曾见过拖拉机的党支部书记，在学会了驾驶和简单的修理的同时，摸着了拖拉机的脾气。他和拖拉机手合作，并组织许多农民，一起来进行试验。开始用一根又粗又长的木头杠子，拴上几副弯钩犁，横挂在拖拉机后边来种大秋作物的土地。后来，经过中共拜泉县委发动群众进一步进行研究和试验，迅速地在全县推广开来，一千多农民群众、六百多拖拉机手，还有一百多个农村铁、木匠，都成了改革能手，各样“垅作”拖带农具陆续出现。
    1958年春天，全县三十四台拖拉机挂上了大量的弯钩犁，三十二个机耕社提早半个月种完了大秋作物的土地。可是跟在拖拉机后边扶犁的社员提出了问题：人凭两条腿走路扶犁，怎能跟的上拖拉机呢？拖拉机开的很慢，人在后边还累的气喘，拖拉机的效能没有很好的发挥。怎么办？没过几天，到夏锄趟地时候，中兴农业社想出了新办法，他们把花轮车改成一种“旧犁扶助车”，和弯钩犁一块挂在拖拉机后边趟地。在这种车上，按照旧犁的数目安上了小小的木头板凳，人坐在小板凳上扶犁。拖拉机就发挥了更大的效率。
    拜泉县有这样的庄稼话：“种在犁上，收在锄上。”趟地是一项重要的增产措施，但一定要和铲地配合进行。机耕社趟地遍数多了，扶犁的人也就用的多了，铲地的人数相对减少，男女老少一齐出动也没铲上四遍地。这又需要把坐车扶犁的人从拖拉机后边解脱出来。于是，又一个更大规模的拖带农具改革运动，在全县范围内掀起了。今年春耕的时候，农民拿出新改革和创造的“起垅播种机”、“悬挂式三用五铧犁”、“牵引式中耕五铧犁”等等，大批扶犁的劳动力就从拖拉机后边解脱出来了。最妙的是“起垅播种机”，使用起来，不仅减去了起垅扶犁的劳动力，而且是一面播种、一面起垅，使播种和起垅的两道工序并作一次完成。这样一来，最初挂在拖拉机后边耕作的旧农具和外来的农业机械结合一起，旧农具由“土”变“洋”，发生了质的变化，就成了适合“垅作”要求的新的拖带农具。
    拜泉县农民的这种创造，不仅仅是解决了当前的一些实际问题，而它深远的意义在于，他们给农业科学研究部门，提供了一个解决“垅作”农具的蓝图，对将来制造出更完备的“垅作”农具有很大意义。
    早些年，拜泉县光用弯钩犁、弯钩锄、弯弯镰刀耕作，地多人少工具笨，种的毛毛草草。那时候是在旧垅上种地，有些简单的把旧垅台翻作新垅沟，有些则是在旧垅台上开条小沟就下种。现在，他们用上了新农具，因为省工出活，就有力量彻底改变了旧日的耕作状况；地还是那么多，人也没有增加多少，可是已经能够深耕细作了。拜泉县今年占耕地面积三分之一左右的小麦和大豆，在认真整地，翻、耙、耢、压搞了几遍以后，把地整的又平又细。其余三分之二左右的大秋作物的土地仍是“垅作”的，然而这种“垅作”，绝大部分已不是在旧垅上种地，而是在土地整平整细以后，重新起垅。“垅作”的概念已经换上了新的内容。（附图片）
