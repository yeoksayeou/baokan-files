Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, July 17th: The Yunnan Provincial Department of Transportation's Transportation Bureau has relied on the masses to strengthen planned management and technical management, vigorously promote technical innovation, improve transportation efficiency, and has achieved good results. In the first half of this year, they transported 78% more materials than in the same period last year.

Starting in February this year, the leadership of the Transportation Bureau organized a group of cadres to go to various key grassroots transportation units to conduct investigation and accounting together with the broad masses of workers. Through rational arrangement of transportation capacity and preparation of plans, they established a planned transportation management system of "fixed vehicles, fixed routes, fixed locations, fixed tasks, and fixed times." After this "five fixings," the chaotic phenomenon of simply relying on shock transportation in the past was eliminated, and transportation efficiency was greatly improved. To transport raw materials from Bajie in Kunming to the Kunming Iron and Steel Company, it originally required 144 trucks to meet the needs. After the "five fixings," only 113 trucks were needed to complete the task as before. The number of trucks transporting coal to the Siying also decreased from 90 to 50 after the "five fixings."

After strengthening planned management, the transportation capacity has been used more fully and rationally, so that while ensuring the transportation of key materials, it is also possible to allocate forces to undertake part of the transportation tasks for general commercial materials. The Xiaguan Transportation Terminal fixed three convoys in the Chuxiong area to transport pit props for the Yipinglang Coal Mine and grain and other materials for Kunming City. In addition, three convoys were used flexibly to transport other materials. At present, 60% of the vehicles in the province are transporting steel, grain and other materials, and 40% of the vehicles are transporting other commodities and other materials.

In terms of technical management, the various transportation terminals under the Transportation Bureau have conscientiously carried out technical transformation of a large number of trailers that were rushed out in the second half of last year, unified the shape of the trailers, and changed the light tonnage to heavy tonnage. Now these trailers can load three to five tons of materials. At the same time, they also formulated the technical specifications and quality indicators of trailers, strengthened the maintenance and upkeep system of trailers, and established a responsibility system for fixed use of trailers. In this way, the quality of a large number of trailers has been consolidated and improved, and the transportation efficiency of trailers in the first half of the year increased by 50% compared with the past, which played an important role in ensuring the completion of the province's transportation plan.

Various transportation terminals have actively mobilized the masses to vigorously promote technical innovation and summarize and promote advanced experiences. The Zhanyi Transportation Terminal submitted 642 technical innovation proposals in the first five months of this year, of which 452 have been implemented. Many suggestions have solved important key problems in production. At the end of May, after the Party organization of the Xiaguan Transportation Terminal disclosed the difficulties encountered, such as the shortage of automobile parts, to the masses, most of the employees of the terminal took action and used waste materials and substitutes for experimentation. By the first half of June, they had completed 17 important technical innovations, which increased the efficiency of manufacturing rivets, screws, and other tools by seven times, solving the urgent problems at that time. There is a "Mu Guiying Class" in the Kunming Transportation Terminal, with six young women driving six "ZIL" brand trucks. Because they often tow trailers, they overfulfilled their tasks every month. After the terminal summarized and promoted the advanced experience of the "Mu Guiying Class," it greatly promoted the motor vehicle train movement. In the second quarter, the materials transported by this terminal using trailers were 50% more than the total amount of trailers transported in the whole of last year. (Attached picture)

### 加强计划管理　大搞技术革新  云南车辆运输效率月月提高

    加强计划管理　大搞技术革新
    云南车辆运输效率月月提高
    新华社昆明17日电　云南省交通厅运输局依靠群众加强计划管理和技术管理，大搞技术革新，提高运输效率，作出了很好的成绩。今年上半年，他们运输的物资比去年同期增长了78％。
    从今年2月份起，运输局的领导方面就组织了一批干部到各个重点基层运输单位，同广大职工群众一起进行摸底和核算，通过合理安排运输能力，编制计划，建立了“定车、定线、定点、定任务、定时间”的计划运输管理制度。经过这样“五定”以后，过去单纯依靠突击运输而产生的混乱现象消除了，运输效率大大提高了。由昆明八街运原料到昆明钢铁公司，原来要一百四十四辆货车才能满足需要，经过“五定”，只要一百一十三辆货车就照样完成了任务。到四营运煤的货车，“五定”以后也由九十辆减少到五十辆。
    加强计划管理以后，运输力得到了更充分合理的使用，就使得在保证重点物资运输的同时，也可以抽出力量来承担一部分一般商业物资的运输任务。下关运输总站固定了三个车队在楚雄地区为一平浪煤矿运输坑木，为昆明市运输粮食等物资，另外有三个车队灵活使用，调运其他的一些物资。目前，全省有60％的车辆运输钢铁、粮食等物资，40％的车辆运输其他的商品等物资。
    在技术管理上，运输局所属的各运输总站都认真地对去年下半年赶制出来的一大批挂车进行了技术改造，统一了挂车形状，把轻吨位改为重吨位，现在这批挂车都已能装载三吨到五吨物资。同时，还制订出挂车的技术规格和质量指标，加强挂车的维修保养制度，建立固定使用挂车的责任制。这样，大批挂车的质量就得到了巩固和提高，上半年全局挂车的运输效率比过去提高了50％，对保证全省运输计划的完成起了重要作用。
    各个运输总站都积极发动群众大搞技术革新，总结推广先进经验。沾益运输总站全体职工今年头五个月内就提出了六百四十二件技术革新建议，已经实现四百五十二件。有很多建议解决了生产上的重要关键问题。5月底，下关运输总站党组织把当前遇到的汽车配件等不足的困难向群众交底以后，总站大部分职工都行动起来，利用废料和代用品进行试验，到6月上半月就完成了十七项重要的技术革新，使制造铆钉、螺丝等工具的工效提高七倍，解决了当时的迫切问题。昆明运输总站有个“穆桂英班”，六个年轻姑娘驾驶着六辆“吉尔”牌货车。她们由于经常拖带挂车，月月都超额完成任务。总站总结推广了“穆桂英班”的先进经验以后，大大推动了汽车列车化运动。第二季度，这个总站用挂车运输的物资，比去年全年挂车的运输量还要多50％。（附图片）
