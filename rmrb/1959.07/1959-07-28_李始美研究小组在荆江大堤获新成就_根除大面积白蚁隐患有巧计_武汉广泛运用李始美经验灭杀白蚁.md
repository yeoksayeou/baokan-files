Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 27th: The termite research group of the Guangzhou Institute of Entomology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, led by termite control expert Li Shimei, recently assisted in termite control on the Jingjiang Dike. With the support of local departments and the masses, they proposed a relatively complete and effective method for eradicating large-scale termite infestations.

This method is as follows: During the summer when termite activity is frequent, "bait stakes" are used to lure and kill termites (wooden stakes that termites like to eat are inserted into the dike to attract termites, then poison is applied to the termites, allowing the poisoned termites to carry the toxicity back to infect other termites). This is more labor-saving and wood-saving than the "bait pits" they used in the past (digging pits in the ground to pile up wood that termites like to eat for baiting and killing). In autumn and winter, when the weather is relatively dry and termites are less active on the ground, "smoke fumigation" is used to kill termites (holes are dug in the dike, and toxic smoke is fumigated into them, killing the termites through the termite tunnels). After using the above two methods, a "grouting" method is used to press grout into the termite-eaten areas. This not only kills the remaining termites but also re-consolidates the dike that has been damaged by termites.

Termites are the main hidden danger inside the Jingjiang Dike, and the dangerous situations caused by termite nests account for a large proportion of each flood season. The research group investigated the Jingjiang Dike for more than twenty days and also discovered that some of the main nests of termites here are very small in diameter, unlike those elsewhere. One nest has two kings and four queens, or three kings and four queens. These findings are valuable for future research on the life history of termites.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 27th: Wuhan City recently conducted a termite survey and extermination campaign. Li Shimei's termite control experience was widely applied during the survey.

A total of more than two thousand termite nests were found throughout the city. They used Li Shimei's method of finding and exterminating nests, following the termites' water-absorbing lines directly to the termite breeding base—the nest—to wipe out the queen, the king, and their offspring in one fell swoop.

This time, some deeply hidden termite infestations were also found. For example, the paint on the surface of some house beams and columns was very beautiful, and some reinforced concrete buildings looked very solid, but termite nests were also found after careful searching by the termite control personnel. They also found a large termite nest, more than one meter high, in the cavity wall of an old reinforced concrete building. It was identified that this nest was more than twenty years old.

    新华社广州27日电　由防治白蚁专家李始美领导的中国科学院广州昆虫研究所白蚁研究组，不久以前到荆江大堤协助防治白蚁时，在当地有关部门和群众的支持下，提出了一套比较完善的根除大面积白蚁隐患的有效方法。
    这个方法是：在夏天白蚁活动频繁时，采用“诱杀桩”诱杀白蚁（将白蚁爱吃的木桩插在堤上，引诱白蚁来吃，再施毒药在白蚁身上，让中毒的白蚁把毒性带回去传染给其他白蚁），这比他们过去采用“诱杀坑”（在地面挖坑堆放白蚁爱吃的木材进行诱杀）的方法，节省人力又节省木材；在秋季和冬季天气比较干燥，白蚁较少到地面活动时，用“烟灌”毒杀白蚁（在堤上挖洞，将毒烟熏进去，通过蚁路将白蚁杀死）。施用了上述两种方法以后，再采用“压浆”办法，将泥浆压进白蚁蛀蚀的地方，这样，即可将遗留的白蚁压死，又可使被白蚁蛀蚀了的堤围重新巩固。
    白蚁是荆江大堤内部的主要隐患，每年汛期由于蚁穴所造成的险情占很大比重。这个研究组在荆江大堤调查了二十多天，还发现这里白蚁一些主巢的直径很小，与别处不同。一巢中有二王四后或三王四后。这些发现对今后研究白蚁生活史具有参考价值。
    新华社武汉27日电　武汉市在最近进行了一次白蚁普查和灭杀工作。普查中，广泛运用了李始美的灭蚁经验。
    全市这次共搜索出二千多个蚁巢。他们运用李始美的找巢灭蚁方法，沿着白蚁吸水线直追到繁殖白蚁的大本营——蚁巢，将蚁后、蚁王和它们的后代一网打尽。
    这次，一些隐蔽很深的蚁患也被找了出来。例如，有的房屋梁柱表面上油漆十分美观，有的钢骨水泥大楼看起来很坚固，但经过灭蚁人员的仔细搜索也发现了白蚁巢穴。他们还在一座旧钢骨水泥大楼的夹墙中，就找出了一个一米多高的大蚁巢，据鉴定这个巢已经有二十多年的历史了。
