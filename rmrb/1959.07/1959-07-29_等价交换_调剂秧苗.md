    Equal Value Exchange, Adjusting Seedlings
    The Heping Commune in Suichuan County, Jiangxi Province, has taken various measures to basically solve the difficulty of lacking rice seedlings on more than 3,000 mu of late rice fields.
    The Heping Commune's solution to the seedling shortage is: 1. Use seedlings sparingly. Fill the missing seedlings in the seedling fields completely; for the late-sown tender seedlings, all localities have taken measures to topdress with human urine and chemical fertilizers to promote accelerated growth. 2. Based on the principle of equal value exchange, implement adjustment of surpluses and shortages. 3. For the intercropped late rice seedlings that have rotted, adopt the method of combining and supplementing, removing the bad and keeping the good, using the few to make up for the many, and merging hills to achieve uniform seedlings. This saves seedlings and reduces the area replanted and the number of missing seedlings. 4. Each production brigade, based on the principle of planting the good fields and fields with water first, and then planting the mountain and pit fields and fields lacking water, rush-plants late rice, thus ensuring that the high-yield fields are all planted first.

    等价交换　调剂秧苗
    江西遂川县和平公社，采取多种措施，基本解决了三千多亩晚稻缺秧苗的困难。
    和平公社解决缺秧的办法是：一、节约用秧。秧田的缺苗，扯净用净；对后播的嫩秧，各地都采取了追施人尿、化肥，促使加速青壮。二、根据等价交换的原则，实行余缺调剂。三、对已沤坏的间作晚稻秧苗，采取并、补办法，去坏留好，以少就多，合并补兜，并丘齐苗。这样节省了秧苗，减少了改种面积和缺秧的数量。四、各生产大队都本着先插好田、有水田，后插山坑田、缺水田的原则，抢插晚稻，这样就保证了产量高的田，全部先插下去。
