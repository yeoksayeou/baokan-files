    Strengthen Unity, Continue to Advance
    --On the Japanese People's Struggle Against Revising the "Security Treaty"

    July of this year is the action month for the Japanese people to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and also the action month for the Japanese people to strive for peace, independence, and democracy. As of July 25, the Japanese people have launched four unified struggles to prevent the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." After the third and fourth "Unified Action Days" on June 25 and July 25, this struggle is now developing in depth.

    The scale and momentum of the recent two "Unified Action Days" were quite considerable. Nearly three million people participated in the third "Unified Action Day to Prevent the Revision of the 'Security Treaty'" on June 25, with as many as 130 mass rallies held across the country. On July 25, the fourth "Unified Action Day to Prevent the Revision of the 'Security Treaty'," over a million people in more than 300 cities and towns, large and small, launched vigorous struggles despite the obstruction and sabotage of the Kishida Nobusuke government's armed police and fascist groups. In Tokyo alone, 20,000 people participated in various activities such as rallies and demonstrations. A joint conference of the Central and Chiyoda districts was also held in the center of Tokyo, demanding the smashing of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the overthrow of the Kishida Nobusuke cabinet. During the "Action Month," various types and scopes of mass rallies were continuously held throughout Japan, and various forms such as street propaganda, signature campaigns, and "lobbying groups" were adopted to conduct extensive propaganda and mobilization.

    The Japanese people's struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" has entered a new stage. First of all, the unity of the people has been greatly strengthened. Joint struggles organized for the common purpose of opposing the revision of the "Security Treaty" have been newly developed throughout the country. As of July 10, joint struggle organizations have been established in all forty-six prefectures except Saitama Prefecture. Currently, almost all joint struggle organizations have the participation of the Japanese Communist Party. The National Conference to Prevent the Revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" (hereinafter referred to as the "National Conference"), composed of 140 mass organizations, trade unions, and progressive parties, is working hard to establish joint struggle organizations at the city, town, and village levels. Moreover, this national organization, which demonstrates the unity of people from all walks of life, has become the center for leading this movement.

    The people from all walks of life who have recently participated in the struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty" are very broad. Not only workers, youth, students, and women, but also cultural leaders, famous scholars, professors, and religious figures have actively joined this movement. For example, on July 7, many scholars and cultural figures formally formed the "Research Association on the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty' Issue." During the preparation process of this group, Aono Suekichi, the president of the Japan Literary Artists Association, and other responsible persons in charge of the preparatory work, issued a "Statement Against the Revision of the 'Security Treaty'." As of July 7, more than 900 scholars and cultural figures have signed it, expressing their support.

    The Japanese people's struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty" has achieved the first round of victory. The Kishida Nobusuke group originally intended to sign the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" in July and approve it at the extraordinary session of the Diet in September. However, under the pressure of the Japanese people's recent two struggles, it has been forced to postpone its original plan again and again. On July 13, Secretary-General Kawashima of the Liberal Democratic Party issued a statement saying that "the revised treaty will be signed in November and submitted to the Diet in February next year."

    The Kishida Nobusuke group's forced postponement of the schedule for revising the "Security Treaty" is, on the surface, due to the intensification of factional struggles within the Liberal Democratic Party. In fact, the most important reason lies in the broad unity and powerful struggle of the people centered on the working class. The wider the unity of the people and the higher the upsurge of the people's struggle, the more intense the contradictions and struggles within the reactionary camp will become. This is a law that the Japanese people have clearly realized from the struggle against the revision of the "Police Duties Law" last year. Now, differing opinions from Kishida Nobusuke's policies have emerged within the Liberal Democratic Party, and even the Japanese National Police Agency is shocked by the upsurge of the Japanese people's struggle. It reported at the National Security Division Chiefs Conference held in mid-July: "It is estimated that the approval stage of the revised treaty will coincide with the struggle to demand wage increases at the end of the year, and the struggle may be more intense than the struggle against the revision of the 'Police Duties Law'."

    The Kishida Nobusuke group is desperately promoting that revising the "Security Treaty" can make Japan-U.S. relations more equal and Japan's autonomy higher; however, the Japanese people can see through this deceptive propaganda. Not only that, but many people within the conservative camp are now feeling anxious and uneasy about the Kishida Nobusuke group's actions. This tendency will become more and more obvious in the future. Currently, quite a few Liberal Democratic Party Diet members are very worried that the Kishida Nobusuke group's forced revision of the "Security Treaty" will lead to various adverse consequences. They are especially worried that the serious deterioration of Japan-China relations will plunge Japan's international status into an inextricable mire. The voices of traders, manufacturers, and cultural figures demanding the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations, Japan-China trade, and Japan-China cultural exchanges are rising day by day, which is also a factor that makes the above-mentioned people more anxious and uneasy. Furthermore, more people in the reactionary camp are worried that Japan will become increasingly isolated among Asian and African countries if this continues.

    Kono Ichiro, Kishida Nobusuke's political rival, openly pointed out: "Even if the Security Treaty is given a new face, what good will it do?" The Kono faction, which originally belonged to the mainstream faction, has also moved from opposing Kishida Nobusuke's policies to criticizing the revision of the "Security Treaty." Other forces within the Liberal Democratic Party who oppose Kishida Nobusuke are even more eager to move, hoping that Kishida Nobusuke will lose power.

    In the new situation, due to the strengthening of the unity of democratic forces, the Japanese people's struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty" will have greater development. At present, the Japanese people are actively preparing to welcome the fifth "Unified Action Day to Prevent the Revision of the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty'" on August 6. "Sohyo" decided on the 16th that after the fourth unified action, it would hold the fifth and sixth unified actions on August 6 and September 7, and prepare to force the Kishida Nobusuke government to dissolve the Diet in the autumn.

    However, it should also be seen that the current Japanese labor front, and even the entire united front against the revision of the "Security Treaty," still has weaknesses. First of all, the Japanese Trade Union Congress and the National Federation of Industrial Organizations, which are relatively large national workers' joint organizations, have not directly participated in this united front. Not only that, but the responsible cadres of these two organizations also openly oppose the policy of using strike strength to struggle to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty."

    Another shortcoming of the struggle against the revision of the "Security Treaty" is that most of the farmers (who account for 40% of the national population) have not actively participated in this struggle. Of course, now farmers are also gradually participating in this movement through the Japan Farmers Association, taking advantage of the demands for higher rice prices and stable silkworm cocoon prices, as well as other struggles. However, since most farmers are not organized, there is no strong "combat system" yet.

    Despite these shortcomings, and despite the twists and turns in the struggle, the Japanese people's struggle to defend independence and peace will continue to develop with the strengthening of the united front of democratic forces and the growth of the awareness of the broad masses of the people. There are more and more people in Japan who desire to take the path of peace and neutrality. When Chairman Nosaka Sanzo of the Japanese Communist Party questioned Kishida Nobusuke on the issue of revising the "Security Treaty" at the House of Councillors meeting on June 27 this year, he emphasized that abolishing the "Security Treaty" and adopting a neutral policy are not only the demands of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, but also the demands of the majority of the people. When he said, "I am convinced that enlightened gentlemen within the Liberal Democratic Party will also feel the same way," there was a burst of strong applause at the meeting. (Attached pictures)

    加强团结　继续前进
    ——记日本人民反对修改“安全条约”斗争
    蓝海
    今年7月是日本人民阻止修改日美“安全条约”行动月，也是日本人民争取和平、独立、民主的行动月。到7月25日为止，日本人民已经掀起了四次阻止修改日美“安全条约”的统一斗争。经过6月25日、7月25日第三、四两次“统一行动日”，目前这一斗争正在向纵深发展。
    最近的两次“统一行动日”的规模和声势，都是相当可观的。6月25日第三次“阻止修改‘安全条约’统一行动日”，有近三百万人参加，光是全国举行的群众集会就达一百三十次。而7月25日第四次“阻止修改‘安全条约’统一行动日”，则有上百万的人民在三百多个大中小城市里，不顾岸信介政府武装警察和法西斯团体的阻挠和破坏，掀起了强有力的斗争。在东京一地，就有两万人参加了集会和游行示威等各种活动。东京的中心区还举行了中央区和千代田区联合大会，要求粉碎日美
  “安全条约”和打倒岸信介内阁。在“行动月”期间，日本各地不断召开各种不同类型、不同范围的群众集会，并且纷纷采取街头宣传、签名运动、“游说小组”等各种形式，进行广泛的宣传鼓动。
    日本人民阻止修改“安全条约”的斗争进入新阶段。首先表现在人民的团结大大加强了。全国各地为反对修改“安全条约”这一共同目的而组织的联合斗争，有了新的发展。到7月10日止，全国四十六个都道府县除埼玉县外，都成立了联合斗争组织。目前几乎所有的联合斗争组织都有日本共产党参加。由一百四十个群众团体、工会和进步党派组成的阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议（以下简称“国民会议”），正在努力建立市、镇、村一级的联合斗争组织。而且，这个显示了各阶层人民团结的全国性组织，已成了领导这一运动的中心。
    最近以来参加反对修改“安全条约”斗争的各阶层人民，是十分广泛的。不仅工人、青年、学生和妇女，而且文化界领袖、著名学者，教授和宗教界人士也都踊跃地投入这一运动。例如，7月7日，许多学者、文化界人士正式组成了“日美‘安全条约’问题研究会”。在这个团体的筹备过程中，日本文艺家协会会长青野季谷等筹备工作负责人，发表了“反对修改‘安全条约’声明”。到7月7日止，已有九百多名学者和文化界人士在上面签名，表示支持。
    日本人民反对修改“安全条约”的斗争，已经取得了第一个回合的胜利。岸信介集团本想在7月签署新的日美“安全条约”，在9月召开的国会临时会议上批准这项条约。但是，在日本人民最近两次的斗争的压力下，它已经被迫一再推迟了原定计划。7月13日，自由民主党干事长川岛发表谈话说，“修改后的条约在11月签署，向国会提出将在明年2月”。
    岸信介集团被迫推迟修改“安全条约”的日程，从现象上来看，是由于自由民主党内部派系斗争加剧。其实，最主要的原因在于以工人阶级为中心的人民的广泛的团结和强大的斗争。人民的团结越广泛，人民斗争越高涨，反动阵营内部的矛盾和斗争也就越发激烈。这已是日本人民从去年反对修改“警职法”斗争中，明确体会到的一条规律。现在，自由民主党内部产生了不同意岸信介方针的意见，连日本警察厅也对日本人民斗争的高涨感到震惊。它在7月中召开的全国警备科长会议上报告说：“估计修改后的条约的批准阶段正赶上年底要求增加工资的斗争，届时斗争可能比反对修改‘警职法’的斗争还要激烈。”
    岸信介集团拼命宣传修改“安全条约”可以使日美关系更加平等，日本的自主性更加提高；但是日本人民是能识破这种欺骗宣传的。不仅如此，保守阵营内部的许多人，现在也对岸信介集团的作法感到焦虑和不安。今后这种倾向还会越来越明显。目前，自由民主党国会议员中有相当多的人，十分担心岸信介集团强行修改“安全条约”会招致种种恶果。他们尤其担心的是日中关系严重恶化下去，日本国际地位将陷入不可自拔的泥泞之中。要求恢复日中邦交、日中贸易和日中文化交流的贸易商、厂商和文化界人士的呼声，日益高涨，这也是促使上述人士更加焦虑和不安的一个因素。再则，反动阵营中有更多的人担心这样下去，日本会在亚非国家当中日益陷于孤立。
    岸信介的政界劲敌河野一郎，公开地指出：
  “即使把安全条约改头换面一下，又能顶什么事呢”？原属主流派的河野派，也已从反对岸信介的方针进而对修改“安全条约”进行批判了。自由民主党内其他反对岸信介的势力更是伺机欲动，盼望岸信介失势。
  在新的局面下，由于民主力量团结的加强，日本人民反对修改“安全条约”斗争，将会有更大的发展。目前，日本人民正在积极准备迎接8月6日第五次“阻止修改日美‘安全条约’统一行动日”。“总评”在16日决定继第四次统一行动后，要在8月6日和9月7日举行第五次和第六次统一行动，并且准备在秋季迫使岸信介政府解散国会。
    但是，还应该看到，目前日本的劳动战线，以至整个反对修改“安全条约”的统一战线，还有弱点。首先，就是一个全国性较大的工人联合组织的全日本工会会议和全国产业别工会联合会，还没有直接参加这一统一战线。不仅如此，这两个组织的负责干部，还公然反对以罢工的实力斗争来阻止修改“安全条约”的方针。
    反对修改“安全条约”斗争的另一个缺陷，是农民（占全国人口的40％）当中大多数人还没有积极投入这一斗争。当然，现在农民也以要求提高米价和稳定蚕茧价格以及其他的斗争为契机，通过日本农民协会，逐渐参加到这一运动中来。不过，由于大部分农民没有组织起来，故还没有一个坚强的“战斗体制”。
    尽管有这些缺点，尽管斗争有曲折，但是，日本人民捍卫独立与和平的斗争，随着民主力量统一战线的加强和广大人民觉悟的增长，是会不断向前发展的。渴望走和平中立道路的人在日本已经越来越多了。今年6月27日日本共产党主席野坂参三在参议院会议上就修改“安全条约”问题质问岸信介时，强调指出废除“安全条约”和采取中立政策，不仅是共产党和社会党的要求，而且是大多数人民的要求。当他说到“我确信自由民主党内有先见之明的诸君也一定会对此抱有同感”时，会议上响起了一阵强烈的掌声。（附图片）
