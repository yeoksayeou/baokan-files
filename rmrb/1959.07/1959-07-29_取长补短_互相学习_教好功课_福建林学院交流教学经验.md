　　Learn From Each Other's Strengths and Weaknesses, Teach Lessons Well:
　　Fujian Forestry College Exchanges Teaching Experiences

　　(Our report) The Fujian Forestry College Party Committee has been focusing on the exchange of teaching experiences to improve teaching quality. In the past month or so, it has organized two college-wide teaching observation meetings in succession. These measures have greatly encouraged and helped the teachers.

　　The Forestry College is a newly established higher education institution with many new teachers, and many of these new teachers are young teaching assistants who lack teaching experience. How to help these new teachers quickly improve their teaching skills, master teaching principles, and teach lessons well has become an important issue for the college Party Committee to lead teaching and improve teaching quality. After research, the college Party Committee decided to adopt the method of focusing on key points, focusing on typical examples, and focusing on experience, selecting teachers with advanced teaching experience, helping to summarize experience, and holding teaching observation meetings to organize promotion. In the teaching observation, leading cadres and teachers of the college Party Committee participated in listening to lectures in order to achieve the purpose of learning from each other's strengths and weaknesses and learning from each other. For example, the first public teaching observation was conducted by Tang Yin-xian, a mechanical drawing teacher from the Forest Chemistry major. His explanation was thorough and proficient, the key points were prominent, he accurately grasped the class time, the logic was strong, and he was able to connect with the previous class, making it easy for students to systematically understand and remember. The shortcomings were that the speaking voice lacked rhythm and the charts were taken out too early. This not only failed to better cooperate with the teaching content to carry out vivid education, but also affected students' attention in class. After listening to the lecture, a review meeting was held the next day, inviting him to participate, pointing out his advantages and disadvantages, helping him improve, and at the same time absorbing his experience and lessons to improve his own teaching methods. This kind of teaching experience observation and exchange is a good opportunity for the teachers giving lectures to improve themselves, and other teachers also learn a lot from it.

　　In order to fully exchange teaching experience, the Forestry College also held a teaching experience exchange meeting at the end of June. More than 80 new and old teachers and leading cadres from the entire college participated in this meeting, and ten more experienced teachers introduced their teaching experience and insights at the meeting. The scope of the introduction was very broad. For example, the Forest Plant Teaching and Research Group introduced the experience of indoor on-site teaching with the theme of improving teaching quality through collective lesson preparation, which everyone thought was very good. Because in the past, everyone felt that on-site teaching could not be achieved indoors, but this time they used the power of collective lesson preparation by the teaching and research group, selected the chapter on leaves, collected more than 40 kinds of fresh specimens of different types of leaves with branches, numbered and grouped them, and arranged them on the desks of each group of students. In this way, the teacher can guide the students to conduct practical observation while explaining the theory, so as to achieve the purpose of conducting theoretical and experimental classes at the same time. If this method is not adopted, the chapter on leaves will not be ideal even if on-site teaching is adopted in the field, because it is neither possible to explain the theory very well in the field, nor is it possible to find a site with more than 40 kinds of different types of leaves for practical observation. Many teachers in the relevant teaching and research group believe that this teaching method enables theory to be closely linked to practice, which is convenient for students to understand theoretical knowledge.

    取长补短　互相学习　教好功课
    福建林学院交流教学经验
    本报讯　福建林学院党委大抓教学经验交流，提高教学质量，近一个多月来，已连续组织两次全院性的大型教学观摩会。这些措施给教师的鼓舞、帮助很大。
    林学院是一所新办的高等学校，新教师多，而且这些新教师中有许多是缺乏教学经验的年青助教。如何及时帮助这些新教师迅速提高教学业务，掌握教学规律，教好功课，便成为院党委领导教学、提高教学质量的重要课题。院党委经过研究，决定采取抓重点、抓典型、抓经验的办法，选择教学上有先进经验的教师，帮助总结经验，并举行教学观摩会，组织推广。在教学观摩中，院党委领导干部和教师都参加听讲，以达到取长补短，互相学习的目的。如第一次公开教学观摩由林化专业机械制图教师唐荫先担任。他讲解得透彻、熟练，重点突出，准确掌握课时，逻辑性较强，并能联系上一节课，使学生便于系统地理解和记忆。缺点是讲话声音缺乏节奏，挂图太早拿出，这样不但不能更好配合讲课内容进行形象化教育，而且影响了学生听课的注意力。大家听完课后，第二天举行评论会，邀请他参加，给他指出优缺点，帮助他提高改进，同时吸取他的经验教训，改进自己教学方法。这种教学经验的观摩交流对主讲的教师是一个很好提高的机会，其他教师也从中学到许多东西。
    为了使教学经验得到充分的交流，林学院还于6月底召开一次教学经验交流会，参加这个会的有全院新老教师和领导干部八十多人，有十个比较有经验的教师在会上介绍自己教学的经验与体会。介绍的范围很广。例如森林植物教研组就以集体备课提高教学质量为题，介绍了室内现场教学的经验，大家都认为很好。因为过去大家都觉得在室内就不能达到现场教学的目的，而他们这次发挥了教研组集体备课的力量，选择了叶子这一章，采集了四十多种不同类型的带有枝条的叶子的新鲜标本，进行编号分组后，排在各组学生的课桌上，这样老师一面在讲解理论，一面就可以引导学生进行实际观察，以达到理论课和实验课同时进行的目的。如果不采取这个办法，叶子这一章就是采取野外现场教学也是不理想的，因为在野外既不能很完善的讲解理论，也不能找到有四十多种不同类型的叶子的现场，可供实际观察。许多有关教研组的教师都认为这种教学方式，使理论能紧密地联系实际，便于学生对理论知识的理解。
