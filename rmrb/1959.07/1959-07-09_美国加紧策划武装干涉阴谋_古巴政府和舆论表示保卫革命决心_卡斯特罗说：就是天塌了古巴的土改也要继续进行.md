(Comprehensive report by this newspaper) According to Xinhua News Agency reports: While using the "Organization of American States" Council meeting to plot interference in Cuba, the United States is further meticulously working to organize an "American States police force," making the situation in the Caribbean region increasingly tense.

According to reports, U.S. Senator George Smathers, in a recorded radio speech on the 4th, stubbornly described the armed struggles against the dictatorial regimes of the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua that broke out some time ago as "invasions," thereby advocating the establishment of a "police force" for intervention. At the same time, U.S. House of Representatives Latin America Subcommittee Chairman Selden hurriedly came out to support Smathers's suggestion, but Selden said, "The initiative must be taken by the Organization of American States, not by the United States." According to a report from United Press International on the same day, the House Foreign Affairs Committee has passed an amendment to the foreign "aid" bill. This amendment stipulates that $31.5 million of the $96.5 million in military aid provided to Latin American countries will be used to establish the aforementioned "police force."

The Cuban government and public opinion continue to condemn the United States' conspiratorial activities. Cuban Prime Minister Castro told farmers at the farmer's rally held at the "Double Rose" sugar mill in Cárdenas, Matanzas Province, on the 6th: "Even if the sky falls, Cuba's land reform will continue." He also warned domestic and foreign enemies who attempt to undermine the Cuban revolution and land reform: "The vast number of farmers is enough to make the enemy tremble." He said: "Let all the enemies collude, we will crush them all at once, because the people have unprecedented confidence, courage, perseverance, and enthusiasm."

Armed Forces Chief of Staff Cienfuegos also spoke at the conference. He said that 500,000 farmers will show the world at this great rally: "We are determined to take up arms and support land reform and the revolutionary government with our lives."

On the same day, Cuban Foreign Minister Raúl Roa declared at the "Organization of American States" Council meeting in Washington that "Cuba cannot tolerate the Dominican government, which violates international law agreements and infringes on human rights, sitting at the meeting table to condemn Cuba." He pointed out that "the Rio de Janeiro Treaty is not applicable in this case because there is no aggression as stipulated in the treaty. An undemocratic government cannot accuse a democratic government like Cuba of aggression."

The Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces organ "Verde Olivo" (Green Olive Tree) published a commentary on the 6th, denouncing Eisenhower's recent remarks about interfering in Cuba as a reprint of "Eisenhowerism." "Combate" (Combat) also published a commentary denouncing John Dreier, the U.S. representative to the "Organization of American States," for openly supporting Trujillo's demand for intervention in Cuba.

Guevara, one of the leaders of the Cuban Armed Forces, who led the Cuban delegation to visit India, told Indian reporters that some people in the United States are trying to reduce the quota of sugar imported from Cuba and describe all of Cuba's development plans as "communist," "which is actually preparing to launch a movement to interfere in our internal affairs under the pretext of defending the hemisphere."

    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：美国在利用“美洲国家组织”理事会会议策划干涉古巴的同时，正进一步处心积虑地进行组织美洲国家“警察部队”的工作，使加勒比海地区局势日趋紧张。
    据报道，美国参议员乔治·斯马瑟斯4日在一次录音广播演说中，硬把前些时候爆发的反对多米尼加和尼加拉瓜独裁政权的武装斗争说成是“入侵”事件，从而鼓吹建立“警察部队”进行干涉。同时，美国众议院拉丁美洲外交小组委员会主席塞尔登赶紧出来帮腔，表示支持斯马瑟斯的建议。但是，塞尔登说，
  “必须由美洲国家组织而不是由美国采取主动”。据合众国际社同一天的报道，众议院外交委员会已经通过一项对外“援助”修正法案。这个修正案规定，从提供给拉丁美洲国家的九千六百五十万美元的军事援助中拨出三千一百五十万用来建立上述“警察部队”之用。
    古巴政府和舆论继续谴责美国的阴谋活动。古巴总理卡斯特罗6日对在马坦萨斯省卡德法斯市“双玫瑰”糖厂举行的农民大会的农民说：“就是天塌了，古巴的土地改革也要继续进行。”他并警告企图破坏古巴革命和土地改革的内外敌人说：“广大的农民就足以使敌人胆寒”。他说：“就让所有敌人勾结起来吧，我们一下子就会把他们全部打垮，因为人民具有空前未有的信心、勇气、坚毅和热情。”
    在这次大会上，武装部队总参谋长西恩富戈斯也发了言。他说，五十万农民将在这次大集会上向全世界表明：“我们决心拿起武器，以我们的生命来支持土地改革，支持革命政府。”
    同一天，古巴外交部长劳尔·罗亚6日在华盛顿召开的“美洲国家组织”理事会会议上宣称，“古巴绝不能容忍违反国际法协定、侵犯人权的多米尼加政府坐在会议桌上谴责古巴。”他指出，“里约热内卢条约在这种情况下是不适用的，因为并不存在着条约中所规定的那种侵略。一个不民主的政府就不能控告像古巴这样的民主政府进行侵略。”
    古巴革命武装部队机关报“绿橄榄树报”6日发表评论，斥责艾森豪威尔最近发表的关于干涉古巴的言论是“艾森豪威尔主义”的再版。“战斗报”也发表评论斥责美国驻“美洲国家组织”的代表约翰·德赖尔公然支持特鲁希略提出的干涉古巴的要求。
  率领古巴代表团到印度访问的古巴武装部队领导人之一格瓦拉向印度记者说，美国的某些人企图削减从古巴进口的糖的限额，并且把古巴的一切发展计划说成是“共产主义的”，“这实际上是在为发动运动作准备，以便借口保卫半球而干涉我们的内政”。（附图片）
