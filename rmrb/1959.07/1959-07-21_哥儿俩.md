Two Brothers
Jiang Ling
Xu Yousheng and Xu Youliang are brothers who both work in a coal mine. Xu Yousheng is a coal miner, and Xu Youliang is a locomotive driver. The two are very close usually, but whenever they sit down together to talk about production, they argue. Their tongues are like needle points against wheat awns, neither willing to give way.

One day, after their shift, they were eating at home when suddenly a sound of gongs and drums, coming from afar, echoed into the residential area. Who had created a new production record again, that the trade union's good news team was delivering a congratulatory report? Xu Yousheng hurriedly put down his rice bowl and ran out to watch. Seeing the good news team passing by the entrance, he happily clapped his hands. Xu Youliang walked to Xu Yousheng's side, patted him on the shoulder, and joked, "Brother! Don't just clap for others. You have to work hard yourself, create a new record, bring honor to your district, and add glory to the family."

"Just you watch, one day the good news team will come to our house."

"It's easy to talk big, I say: your district only knows how to boast. At the mobilization meeting, you proposed to reach a daily team output of 700 tons, but after that, you threw it to the back of your mind. There's not a stir, causing our electric locomotive team to be perpetually underfed, having to sit down and rest." Xu Youliang used the strategy of provoking him to action.

"Don't be like Old Wang selling melons, praising your own wares. On high-yield days, we produce more coal, and you can't digest it, can't transport it out, and you still say you're underfed?" Xu Yousheng retorted, unconvinced.

"If you have the ability, show it, let's see if we can't digest it, or if you're just bragging?" Xu Youliang also got angry, his eyes bulging bigger than lanterns.

The two argued until their faces turned red and their necks swelled, but their mother came to break the siege, pursing her lips and saying, "You two are really like rice bowls and cups, always bumping and clashing when you're together. You're brothers, can't you give way a little?"

Since the brothers quarreled, Xu Yousheng devoted himself even more to his "inclined hole drilling method." One day, as soon as he finished his shift, he ran straight to the Party branch secretary's office. As soon as he entered, he said with wild joy, "Branch Secretary, I've figured out a way! Using inclined drilling will definitely improve blasting efficiency." As Xu Yousheng spoke, he drew diagrams for the branch secretary to see.

"This method is good. I'll discuss it with the district leader right away. Go home and wait for news," the branch secretary said, patting Xu Yousheng kindly.

Xu Yousheng returned home, and before he had finished smoking a cigarette, Zhao Baoquan, the district's technician, ran over: "Your suggestion has already been studied in an emergency technical innovation group meeting. The branch secretary and the district leader asked me to call you, saying to go down the well immediately to conduct experiments."

Xu Yousheng and Zhao Baoquan rushed out the door, and happened to collide with Xu Youliang. Xu Yousheng saw that his younger brother was talking to a female electric locomotive driver from their team as they walked in. Xu Yousheng thought to himself, "You only know how to date after your shift, and don't think about production at all. You'll only know how serious it is when we post a request for assistance on your electric locomotive tomorrow!"

The next day, in the entry room of the No. 2 coal face, people were bustling with smiles on their faces. At this time, the district leader walked in and said to everyone: "The 'inclined hole drilling method' experiment was a success. The blasting force is truly great. From today onwards, we can realize the high-yield slogan of a daily team output of 700 tons and achieve a large-scale harvest."

"Quickly spread this experience. We can't just have our district achieve high yield, we must let all the mining area's faces achieve all-around high yield and all-around harvest," the Party branch secretary walked over and said to the district leader.

"If all the districts increase production, how can the transportation district's electric locomotives pull it all?" a worker stood up and asked.

"Immediately send them a request for assistance to urge them on, and ask them to immediately improve their operating methods!" Xu Yousheng said, picking up a large red paper, and writing several lines of bold characters: "We have improved the inclined drilling and blasting method, and in the future, the mine's daily team output can be increased to 2,500 tons. We require the electric locomotive team to cooperate well and not be unable to digest it." Several people beat gongs and drums, holding this request for assistance, and headed straight for the transportation district's entry room.

Before they were even close to the transportation district's entry room, they heard the sound of gongs and drums coming from there as well. Xu Yousheng smiled and said: "What, is the transportation district coming to receive our request for assistance?"

Just as he was saying this, they saw people from the transportation district also beating gongs and drums, carrying a sign covered with red paper, with the words "Request for Assistance" written on it. Xu Yousheng rushed over in a few steps, grabbed the transportation district leader's hand and asked: "Are you also coming to request assistance?"

"Yes! Are you still in the dark? Your brother has improved the switching method!"

"It's not just me alone, there's also a young girl!" Xu Youliang playfully patted the female electric locomotive driver next to him and said.

The Party branch secretary of the No. 2 coal face walked over and said, "What a coincidence! Do you know who came up with our inclined drilling method?"

Xu Yousheng and Xu Youliang looked at each other's bloodshot eyes, and everything became clear. Xu Youliang immediately ran up and hugged Xu Yousheng, shouting loudly and excitedly "Brother! It's you!"

    哥儿俩
    江陵
    徐有生和徐有良俩兄弟，都在煤矿工作。徐有生是采煤工人，徐有良是电机车司机。两个人平时亲得很，但只要坐在一起谈起生产上的事，就要抬扛。两张嘴真是针尖对麦芒，谁也不让人。
    这一天，两人出了班，正在家里吃饭，忽然一阵锣鼓声从远而近响进了住宅区。又是谁创造了生产新纪录，工会报喜队送喜报来了呢？徐有生忙丢下饭碗，跑出去看，看着报喜队往门口经过，他也高兴的直鼓掌。徐有良走到徐有生身边，拍一下他的肩膀，打趣地说：“哥！你别净给别人鼓掌，也得自己努把力，创个新纪录，为你们区里长长脸，为家里增增光。”
    “你瞧着吧，总有一天报喜队要来我们家。”
    “躺着说话不腰疼，我说呀：你们区只会吹牛。在誓师大会上提出要达到班产七百吨，可过后就丢到脑背后去了，没有一点风吹草动，弄得我们电车组天天吃不饱，要坐下来歇气。”徐有良采用了请将不如激将的办法。
    “别老王卖瓜，自卖自夸。高产日我们多出点煤，你们就消化不良，运不出来，还说是吃不饱呢。”徐有生不服气的说。
      “有本事拿出来，看我们是消化不良，还是你们瞎吹牛？”徐有良也火了，两只眼睛鼓得比灯笼还大。
    两个人争得脸红脖子粗，还是妈妈出来解了围，噘着嘴说：“你们真是饭碗和杯子，搁在一起，时常撞撞碰碰。自家兄弟嘛，让一点不就行了。”
    自从兄弟俩赌了气，徐有生就更加钻他那个“斜形打眼法”了。这一天，他一出班，就连跑带跳的直奔党支部书记办公室。一进门，他就欢喜若狂地说：“支部书记，我摸到了一个门道了。用斜形打眼，放炮效率准提高。”徐有生一面说着一面画图样给支部书记看。
      “这办法好，我马上找区长商量，你回家去等信吧。”支部书记拍拍徐有生，很亲切的说。
    徐有生回到家，还没有吸完一根香烟，区里的技术员赵宝泉就跑来了：“你的建议，我们已开了紧急技术革新小组会研究过了。支部书记和区长要我来喊你，说立刻到井下去进行试验呢。”
    徐有生和赵宝泉冲出门，恰巧和徐有良撞了个满怀。徐有生一看，老弟正同他们组里的一个女电车司机谈着话走进来。徐有生暗自说：“出班只晓得谈恋爱，一点不想想生产上的事，明天把求援书贴在你们电车上才晓得厉害！”
    第二天，在回采二区的井口进班室里，人们闹哄哄的，每个人脸上都露出笑容。这时，区长走进来对大家说：“‘斜形打眼法’试验成功了，爆破力真大，从今天起，我们就可以实现班产七百吨的高产口号，实现大面积丰收了。”
      “赶紧把这个经验传出去。不能光我们区实现高产，要让全矿各个回采区都实现面面高产，面面丰收。”党支部书记走过来对区长说。
      “各区都提高产量，运输区的电机车怎么拉得赢呢？”一个工人站起来问。
    “马上给他们送求援书去，促进他们一下，要他们马上改进操作方法！”徐有生说着，就拿起一张大红纸，用笔写了几行大字：“我们改进斜眼放炮法，今后全矿班产量可提高到二千五百吨，要求电车组配合好，不要消化不了。”几个人打起锣鼓来，拿着这张求援书，直奔向运输区进班室。
    离运输区进班室还有好远，他们就听到那里也响起了锣鼓声，徐有生笑着说：“怎么，运输区来接我们的求援书了？”
    正说着只见运输区的人也打着锣鼓抬出一块用红纸糊的牌子来，上面也写着“求援书”几个大字。徐有生几个箭步走过去，抓着运输区长的手问道：“你们也来求援啦？”
      “是呀！你还蒙在鼓里，你弟弟改进了调车法呀！”
      “不是我一个人，还有一个毛丫头呀！”徐有良调皮地拍着他旁边的那个女电车司机说。
    回采二区的党支部书记走过来说：“巧得很呀！你们知道我们的斜形打眼法是谁想出来的吗？”
    徐有生和徐有良互相望了望对方布满血丝的眼睛，一切都明白了。徐有良立刻跑上去拥抱着徐有生，大声地激动地喊着“哥哥！是你！”
