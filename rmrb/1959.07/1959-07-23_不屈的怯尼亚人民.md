    The Unyielding People of Kenya
    By our reporters Yu Minsheng and Yuan Mu
    "One day, more than a dozen soldiers from the British colonial forces in Kenya broke into a village. They severely tortured a group of Kenyan women, attempting to obtain information about the local people's resistance against the British colonial rulers. At that time, a woman stepped forward and led the colonial beasts to her home, 'treating' her 'honored guests' with the best wine. When the British soldiers were drunk, she seized the guns from their hands and ended their lives one by one. Later, she was unfortunately arrested and heroically sacrificed in prison..."
    This is one of the many stories of the heroic struggle of the Kenyan people that Oswatta, the former General Secretary of the East African Trade Union Federation of Kenya, who is currently visiting our country, told reporters.
    "Her name is Salia. This immortal heroine is not dead, she will always live in the hearts of the Kenyan people!" Oswatta said excitedly: "The Kenyan people are not afraid of sacrifice in the struggle against British colonial rule. When one person falls, more Kenyans stand up!"
    As Oswatta raised his hands to emphasize his words, we noticed a long purple scar on his left arm. This was a mark left on him by the British colonialists.
    The incident occurred in 1953. A leader of the Kenyan national independence movement was murdered by the British colonial rulers on trumped-up charges. At that time, Oswatta led the masses in a grand funeral, strongly protesting the atrocities of the British colonialists. While the funeral was in progress, the British colonial authorities sent a large number of troops and armed police to interfere and opened fire on the people attending the funeral. Oswatta was injured at that time.
    Recalling the past, Oswatta couldn't help but sing a song they had sung at the funeral that year:
    Struggling for freedom and independence,
    We will bleed, we will sacrifice,
    But in the end we will achieve victory.
    You sacrificed for freedom, you will live forever in the hearts of the people!…………
    Oswatta's impassioned singing expressed the strong fighting spirit of the heroic Kenyan people. And his strong condemnation of the brutal rule of the British colonialists in the conversation further revealed why the Kenyan people were so determined to never yield in the struggle.
    Since Kenya was occupied by Britain as its colony, the Kenyan people have become slaves of the colonialists. As early as 1923, the British government sent a colonial governor. Kenya was divided into several provinces. For more than 30 years, the candidates from the provincial governor to the district chiefs were designated by the colonialists. Among the more than six million people in Kenya, 97% are black, and none of them can hold important positions in the government. The British colonial authorities established a so-called Legislative Council in Kenya, and the speaker was the British colonial governor. Before 1944, there were no black members in the Legislative Council. This Legislative Council had formulated many laws and regulations, which expressly stipulated that colonialists could oppress and exploit black people at will.
    The British colonialists used force to seize all the fertile land for themselves, driving the indigenous people to semi-desert areas. Sixty-two thousand white immigrants occupied more than half of Kenya's land, while the impoverished Kenyan people were forced to be slaves to the white immigrants. The colonialists controlled the entire economy of Kenya and monopolized export trade. The colonialists had forcibly stipulated that Kenyans could not sell products from one region to another, and could only sell them to white immigrants. Therefore, British colonialists became nouveau riche with huge profits. Oswatta told us that there are only 62,000 white immigrants in Kenya, but their income far exceeds the total income of more than six million Kenyans!
    Western colonialists are most fond of talking about "religious freedom." However, in Kenya, Oswatta told us, more than four million Kenyans were deprived of religious freedom. All 30,000 churches in the Kikuyu region were destroyed. Some of these churches were burned down by the colonialists, some were turned into prisons, and some were turned into places for interrogating Kenyan patriots. Many bishops and believers were arrested and imprisoned, for the reason that they resisted the brutal rule of the British colonialists.
    But the inhuman colonial rule has never been able to conquer the Kenyan people. For decades, the Kenyan people have persisted in their struggle for national independence. In 1944, the "Kenya African Union," which led the Kenyan people in their struggle, was organized, followed by major workers' strikes, Kenyans destroying British plantations and farms... The British colonialists panicked. On October 20, 1952, the colonial authorities declared a "state of emergency" in Kenya, transferred tens of thousands of troops and police from the British mainland to launch a frantic attack on the Kenyan people, all progressive organizations in Kenya were banned from activities, and Kenya African Union" leader Kenyatta was arrested, and he is still living in exile today. Large numbers of patriots were massacred or imprisoned in concentration camps throughout the country.
    Speaking here, Oswatta sadly and indignantly accused: "Until now, the 'state of emergency' in Kenya has not been lifted. Almost all the property of Kenyans has been destroyed, and 35,000 Kenyans have died under the knives of the colonialists. Many of them are women, and some are religious leaders. Many people were buried alive."
    "We will never give up until we achieve final victory. The Kenyan people's struggle for national independence will not stop!" Oswatta firmly expressed this belief. He told us that shortly after the British colonialists declared a "state of emergency," the Kenyan people organized their own armed resistance forces, fought the colonialists for more than five years, and dealt a heavy blow to the British colonialists. Now the armed forces have sneaked into the large jungles, and when the time is right, they will still come out to attack the enemy. Oswatta proudly mentioned that once, a commander led the resistance forces to attack a town and encountered a white woman and a child. His subordinates wanted to kill the woman and the child, but he stopped them. He said to his subordinates: "They are not guilty!" He wanted the white woman to tell the British government: "Although we have not defeated you now, we will definitely defeat you in the future. Africa will defeat you, the truth will defeat you, and I and my friends will defeat you. Our friends are all over the world, in the Soviet Union, in China, and in your Britain!"
    Oswatta also introduced another story to us, explaining the Kenyan people's unyielding struggle.
    In the Niata area, five or six women were forced by the British colonial army to deliver ammunition. Three of the women escaped halfway and ran to the home of an African in the countryside. The colonial authorities sent nearly a hundred British soldiers to chase them all the way to that village. Because the resistance forces, who were active in the countryside and large jungles, often dealt fatal blows to the British colonial army, none of the British soldiers dared to approach the African house. They were afraid that resistance forces were hiding there and would launch a sudden attack on them. So, the British soldiers set fire around the village from a distance, trying to burn the escaped Kenyan women to death in that house. At this very dangerous moment, four female warriors from the resistance forces rushed from the forest to rescue their compatriots. Taking advantage of the cover of thick smoke, they crawled into the house, immediately sent someone to send the three escaped women away, and insisted on fighting in the house surrounded by fire. They killed thirty or forty British soldiers until they estimated that their compatriots had been safely rescued, and then quietly transferred in the dark. The British soldiers found that the gunfire in the village had stopped, and only then did they enter the house surrounded by fire with unabated fear.
    Oswatta talked eloquently, his heart filled with grief and anger when he talked about the atrocities of the colonialists, and he was overjoyed when he talked about the people's struggle. He said: "I can't finish what's in my heart even in a day and a night!" "The Kenyan nationalists cannot be eliminated. Those who believe in airplanes, artillery and bombs are just wasting their time! Our struggle will surely be victorious. Kenya belongs to the Kenyan people, and the colonialists must get out of Kenya!"

    不屈的怯尼亚人民
    本报记者　于民生　袁木
    “有一天，怯尼亚英国殖民部队的十多个士兵闯进了一个村庄，他们严刑拷打一群怯尼亚妇女，企图得到有关当地人民反抗英国殖民统治者的情报。当时，一位妇女挺身而出，把殖民野兽们带到自己家里，用最好的酒‘款待’她的‘佳宾’。当英国兵喝得酩酊大醉的时候，她夺过了英国兵手里的枪，一个个结果了他们的生命。后来，她不幸被捕入狱，英勇地牺牲在监狱里……。”
    这是正在我国访问的怯尼亚前东非工会联合会总书记奥斯瓦塔告诉记者的许多怯尼亚人民英勇斗争故事中的一个。
    “她的名字叫莎利娅。这位不朽的女英雄没有死，她永远活在怯尼亚人民的心里！”奥斯瓦塔激动地说：“怯尼亚人民在反对英国殖民统治的斗争中是不怕牺牲的，一个人倒下了，更多的怯尼亚人站了起来！”
    在奥斯瓦塔举起双手加强他说话的语气时，我们发现他左胳膊上有一条长长的紫色疤痕。这是英国殖民者给他留下的烙印。
    事情发生在1953年。怯尼亚的一位民族独立运动领袖，被英国殖民统治者以莫须有的罪名杀害了。当时，奥斯瓦塔领导群众举行了一个规模盛大的葬礼，强烈抗议英国殖民主义者的暴行。葬礼正在进行的时候，英国殖民当局派来了大批军队和武装警察横加干涉，并且向参加葬礼的人们开枪射击。奥斯瓦塔就是在那个时候受了伤。
    忆及往事，奥斯瓦塔情不自禁地唱起了他们当年在葬礼上曾经唱过的一首歌：
    为自由独立而斗争，
    我们会流血，会牺牲，
    但最终我们会得到胜利。
    你为自由而牺牲，将永远活在人民心里！…………
    奥斯瓦塔激昂慷慨的歌声，表达了英勇的怯尼亚人民的坚强斗志。而他在谈话中对英国殖民者残暴统治的强烈控诉，更进一步道出了怯尼亚人民在斗争中为什么会那样地誓死不屈。
    怯尼亚自从被英国霸占为它的殖民地以后，怯尼亚人民就变成了殖民主义者的奴隶。远在1923年，英国政府就派来了殖民总督。怯尼亚被划分成几个省，三十多年来，上自省长下至各区区长的人选，都是由殖民主义者指定的。在怯尼亚六百多万人口中97％是黑人，而他们没有一个人能在政权中担任重要职务。英国殖民当局在怯尼亚成立了所谓立法会议，议长就是英国殖民总督，在1944年以前，立法会议里没有一个黑人议员。这个立法会议曾制定了许多法律和条例，明文规定殖民主义者可以随意压迫和剥削黑人。
    英国殖民主义者用武力把全部良田攫为己有，把土著居民赶到半沙漠地带。六万二千名白种移民霸占着怯尼亚一半以上的土地，贫困的怯尼亚人民则被迫充当白种移民的奴隶。殖民主义者操纵着怯尼亚的整个经济，垄断着出口贸易。殖民主义者曾强行规定，怯尼亚人不得把这一个地区的产品卖给另外一个地区，而且只能卖给白种移民。因此，英国殖民主义者成了一本万利的暴发户。奥斯瓦塔告诉我们：在怯尼亚的白种移民只有六万二千人，而他们的收入却远远超过六百多万怯尼亚人的总收入！
    西方殖民主义者是最喜欢喋喋不休地说什么“宗教自由”的。然而在怯尼亚，奥斯瓦塔告诉我们，有四百万以上的怯尼亚人被剥夺了宗教自由。吉库犹地区的三万座教堂全部被摧毁，这些教堂有的被殖民主义者烧毁，有的变成了监狱，有的变成了审讯怯尼亚爱国者的场所。许多主教和教徒被捉进监狱，理由就是因为他们反抗英国殖民者的残酷统治。
    但惨无人道的殖民统治，从来也没有能够征服怯尼亚人民。几十年来，怯尼亚人民一直坚持进行争取民族独立的斗争。1944年，领导怯尼亚人民进行斗争的“怯尼亚非洲人联盟”组织起来，随之而起的是工人的大罢工爆发了，怯尼亚人捣毁了英国人的庄园和农场……。英国殖民主义者恐慌了，在1952年10月20日，殖民当局宣布怯尼亚进入“紧急状态”，从英国本土调动了数以万计的部队和警察向怯尼亚人民疯狂进攻，怯尼亚一切进步组织都被禁止活动，“怯尼亚非洲人联盟”领袖肯雅塔被逮捕了，他至今还过着流放生活。大批大批的爱国志士遭到屠杀或被关进遍布全国的集中营。
    谈到这里，奥斯瓦塔悲愤地控诉说：“直到现在为止，怯尼亚的‘紧急状态’依然没有取消。几乎所有怯尼亚人的财产都遭到破坏，有三万五千怯尼亚人死在殖民主义者的屠刀下。其中不少是妇女，也有一些宗教领袖，许多人是被活埋的”。
    “不取得最后胜利誓不罢休，怯尼亚人争取民族独立的斗争是不会停止的！”奥斯瓦塔坚定地表达着这个信念。他告诉我们，就在英国殖民主义者宣布“紧急状态”以后不久，怯尼亚人民组织了自己的武装抵抗部队，同殖民主义者进行了五年多战斗，给了英国殖民主义者以沉重的打击。现在武装部队已潜入大丛林，一遇适当时机，他们仍要出来打击敌人。奥斯瓦塔充满着自豪地谈到，有一次，一位指挥员率领抵抗部队去进攻一个城镇，遇到一个白人妇女和一个小孩子，他的部下要把这个妇女和小孩杀死，他制止了，他对属下说：“有罪的不是她们！”他要白人妇女转告英国政府说：“虽然现在我们还没有战胜你们，但是将来我们一定要战胜你们。非洲将战胜你们，真理将战胜你们，我和我的朋友将战胜你们。我们的朋友在全世界，在苏联、在中国都有，在你们英国也有！”
    奥斯瓦塔又给我们介绍了另外一个故事，说明怯尼亚人民不屈的斗争。
    在尼雅塔地方，有五、六个妇女被英国殖民军队强迫去送军火，有三个妇女半路上逃跑到农村中一家非洲人家里。殖民当局派了近百名英国兵，一直追赶到那个村庄。由于神出鬼没地活跃在农村和大丛林中的抵抗部队经常给英国殖民军队以致命的打击，英国兵谁也不敢接近那座非洲人的房子，他们怕那里隐藏有抵抗部队，会出来突然袭击他们。于是，英国兵就远远地在村庄周围放火，企图把逃跑的怯尼亚妇女烧死在那所房子里。就在这十分危险的时刻，四个抵抗部队的女战士从森林中赶来拯救她们的同胞姐妹。她们借着漫天浓烟的掩护，匍匐着进入那所房子，一面立刻派一个人把三个逃出来的妇女送走，一面在被大火包围的房子里坚持战斗。她们打死了三、四十名英国兵，直到估计自己的同胞姐妹已被安全地救出时，才在黑夜中悄然转移。英国兵发现村庄里枪声已经停止，这才怀着尚未平复的惊恐，进入那所被大火包围的房子。
    奥斯瓦塔滔滔不绝地谈述着，谈到殖民主义者的暴行时他悲愤交集，谈到人民斗争时他又喜悦万分。他说：“就是一天一夜也道不完我的心里话！”“怯尼亚的民族主义者是消灭不了的。那些相信飞机大炮和炸弹的人，只不过是浪费他们的时间而已！我们的斗争一定胜利。怯尼亚是属于怯尼亚人的，殖民主义者必须滚出怯尼亚！”
