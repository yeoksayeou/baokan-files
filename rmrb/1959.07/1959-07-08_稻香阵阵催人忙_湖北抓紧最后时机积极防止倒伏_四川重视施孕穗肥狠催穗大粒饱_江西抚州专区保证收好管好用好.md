Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan. The six million mu of early rice planted in Hubei Province this year is growing exceptionally well. It is currently budding, heading, flowering, and filling. In areas where transplanting was done earlier, harvesting will begin in just ten days. Based on past experience, early rice is most susceptible to lodging and various pests and diseases as it approaches maturity. Under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, the peasants in various regions, adhering to the spirit of "not relaxing management until the harvest is in hand," are seizing the last opportunity to actively prevent lodging and the spread of pests and diseases. Jianli County recently mobilized the masses to drain and sun-dry over 110,000 mu of early rice fields at risk of lodging. They also applied plant ash to strengthen the stems in over 30,000 mu of early rice fields. In Xiaogan, Huanggang, and other regions, some counties have assessed each paddy field to strive for large-scale increases in production. For early rice that is not growing well enough or is growing too vigorously, nitrogen fertilizer and phosphorus-potassium fertilizer were applied separately to promote larger, more numerous, and fuller grains.

While strengthening field management, various regions are also starting early preparations for the early rice harvest and the early transplanting of late rice. Commercial and handicraft departments in various regions are also actively organizing the supply of materials and the production of various tools to support the early rice harvest. The handicraft departments in Hanchuan and other ten counties alone have repaired a large number of manual and animal-powered threshing machines, harvesting tools, sickles, and transportation vehicles.

Chengdu, July 7th. Farmers in Sichuan Province have proposed "Management doesn't stop until the early rice is harvested," and are focusing on the late-stage management of early rice.

Various regions are first paying attention to applying fertilizer during the booting stage and have launched a fertilizer accumulation and production campaign to supply fertilizer. The Luzhou region has accumulated and produced over 10 billion jin of fertilizer, and early rice has generally been fertilized once. In fertilizer application, Dazu County applies additional phosphorus-potassium fertilizer to first-class seedlings with sufficient nitrogen fertilizer, mixed nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium fertilizer to second-class seedlings, and quick-acting fertilizer to third-class seedlings, with remarkable results. A survey by the Fuming Commune in Nanxi County showed that before the application of fertilizer during the booting stage, each ear of early rice generally produced only 80 to 100 grains; after the application of fertilizer, it increased to more than 110 grains, with the total number of grains for the commune's more than 6,000 mu of rice increasing by about 20% to 30%.

Various regions have also universally carried out "three preventions": preventing insects, preventing diseases, and preventing lodging. Over 80,000 people in Fushun County were mobilized for a concentrated insect control effort. Naxi County also established specialized insect control teams, who sprayed pesticides on all the more than 50,000 mu of rice fields found to have rice borers within three days. Various regions have also adopted many methods to eliminate third-class seedlings in turn. Leshan County recently proposed measures such as diligent cultivation, deep cultivation, and more fertilization for third-class seedlings, and the county's more than 14,000 mu of third-class seedlings were quickly upgraded.

Nanchang, July 7th. Before the early rice harvest, the masses in the Fuzhou region of Jiangxi Province universally conducted discussions on ensuring the early rice is well harvested, well managed, and well utilized, and formulated a set of specific and effective methods.

The 2.4 million mu of early rice in the Fuzhou region of Jiangxi Province has turned golden, and harvesting will begin in ten days.

In order to ensure that the early rice is well harvested, well managed, and well utilized, and to improve the field management of autumn crops, cadres and commune members throughout the region, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, comprehensively discussed this issue. Based on the opinions put forward by the masses in the discussion, the Fuzhou Prefectural Committee recently formulated a specific plan for the entire region for the good harvesting, good management, and good utilization of early rice and labor arrangements.

1.  Require all regions to do a good job in planning fields, harvesting order, and labor allocation, so that they can cut, thresh, and transport at the same time, cutting one field and threshing one field, and finishing cutting, threshing, and transporting on the same day. 2. Turn and winnow frequently to ensure that every grain is dry and prevent mold. Implement separate warehouse management for grain in storage to avoid mixing various grains together. Each brigade has established a grain storage committee, selected politically reliable people with storage experience as custodians, and established a complete set of income and expenditure systems from collection to payment. 3. In the use of grain, first, the task of purchasing grain for storage must be completed, and then seed grain, food grain, feed grain, and reserve grain must be arranged. At the same time, it is necessary to earnestly carry out the propaganda and education of diligence, thrift, and household management, and saving grain.

In order to ensure that the various measures for good harvesting, good management, and good utilization are earnestly implemented, the Fuzhou Prefectural Committee has, according to the opinions discussed by the masses, set out four systems: 1. Implement a yield verification system, from cutting to transportation, from transportation to drying, from drying to warehousing, to verify the yield and carefully check the quality in every step. 2. Implement a strict handover system for field harvesting, grain transportation, grain drying, storage, and accounting. 3. Implement a mass supervision system for field harvesting, planned grain use, and handover procedures. 4. Implement a mass protection system, formulate a protection pact, and the masses will jointly take on the responsibility of harvesting and guarding warehouses, as well as protecting grain from wind, rain, fire, and theft.

The main method used by the Fuzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China to solve the problem of labor shortage in the summer harvest and summer planting is to require each production brigade to implement a specialized contract responsibility system and form a specialized summer harvest and summer planting team. The summer harvest team includes the harvesting and drying team. The harvesting team is responsible for harvesting and threshing, and transporting from the field back to the drying yard; the drying team is responsible for drying and winnowing, and transporting into the warehouse. The summer planting team includes the plowing and harrowing team and the transplanting team. The plowing and harrowing team is responsible for plowing and harrowing, applying basal fertilizer, and plowing while harvesting; the transplanting team is responsible for pulling seedlings, rational close planting, plowing while transplanting, and completing tasks on time, with quality and quantity guaranteed. In addition, it is required that labor cooperation should also be carried out between communes and between teams to completely solve the difficulties of insufficient labor.

The Fuzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China requires Party committees at all levels to further mobilize the masses in accordance with the above-mentioned methods and requirements, and to formulate specific methods and measures for their own communities and teams to harvest, manage, and use well in a manner appropriate to local conditions, so as to ensure a bumper harvest of early rice.

    稻香阵阵催人忙
    湖北抓紧最后时机积极防止倒伏
    四川重视施孕穗肥狠催穗大粒饱
    江西抚州专区保证收好管好用好
    据新华社武汉讯　今年湖北省种植的六百多万亩早稻长得特别好，目前正在打苞抽穗，扬花灌浆，插秧较早的地区只有十来天就收割了。根据历年经验，早稻在接近成熟时，最易倒伏和发生各种病虫害。各地农民在各级党委的领导下，本着“丰收不到手，管理不放松”的精神，抓紧最后时机，积极防止早稻倒伏和病虫害蔓延。监利县最近发动群众对十一万多亩有倒伏危险的早稻进行了排水晒田，还在三万多亩的早稻田里追施了壮秆的草木灰。孝感、黄冈等专区有些县为争取大面积增产，对丘丘稻田都做了鉴定，对生长不够好或生长过旺的早稻，分别追施了氮肥和磷钾肥，促使早稻穗大、粒多、粒饱。
    在加强田间管理同时，各地都提早动手准备早稻抢收和晚稻抢插工作。各地商业、手工业部门也正在积极组织物资供应和生产各种工具，支援早稻抢收。仅汉川等十个县的手工业部门，就修理了大批的人力、畜力脱粒机、割禾器、镰刀和运输车辆。
    本报成都7日电　四川省农民提出“早稻不开镰，管理不收兵”，狠狠抓早稻后期管理。
    各地首先注意施孕穗肥，并开展了积肥造肥运动，供应肥料。泸州专区积肥造肥一百多亿斤，早稻普遍施了一次肥。大足县在施肥中分别对氮肥足的一类苗增施磷钾肥，二类苗施氮磷钾混合肥，三类苗施速效肥，效果十分显著。南溪县阜鸣公社调查，这个社的早稻施穗肥前，一般每穗结子只八十到一百粒；施穗肥后就增到一百一十多粒，全社六千多亩水稻总粒数约增20％到30％。
    各地还普遍开展了防虫、防病害、防倒伏的“三防”。富顺县出动了八万多人突击治虫。纳溪县还建立治虫专业队，他们在三天内把发现有螟害的五万多亩稻田全部洒了药剂。各地还采取许多办法轮翻消灭三类苗。乐山县最近提出对三类苗勤中耕、深中耕、多施肥等措施，全县一万四千多亩三类苗很快就升了级。
    本报南昌7日电　江西抚州专区群众在早稻收割前夕，普遍进行了保证早稻收好、管好、用好的讨论，并制定出一套具体有效的办法。
    江西抚州专区二百四十万亩早稻已一片金黄，再过十天即开始收割。
    为了保证早稻收好、管好、用好，并搞好秋季作物的田间管理，全区干部和社员在各级党委的领导下，全面讨论了这个问题。抚州地委根据群众在讨论中提出的意见，最近制定了全区的早稻收好、管好、用好和劳动安排的具体计划。
    一、要求各地做好田亩规划、收割顺序和劳力分配等工作，做到边割边打边运，割完一丘打完一丘，当天割完当天打完运完。二、多翻勤扬，保证粒粒干燥，防止霉烂。入仓粮食实行分仓管理，避免各种粮食混淆一起。各大队成立了粮食保管委员会，选择政治可靠、有保管经验的人作保管员，并建立起从收藏到支付的全套收支制度。三、在粮食使用上，首先要完成征购粮入库，其次安排好种子粮、口粮、饲料粮和储备粮。同时要认真开展勤俭持家和节约用粮的宣传教育。
    为保证收好、管好、用好的各项办法得到认真执行，抚州地委根据群众讨论意见又定出了四项制度：一、实行产量核实制度，由割到运，由运到晒，由晒到进仓，环环核实产量和认真检查质量。二、实行田间收割、运粮、晒粮、保管、会计的严密交接制度。三、实行田间收割、计划用粮、交接手续等群众监督制度。四、实行群众护收制度，订出护收公约，由群众共同负起收割和看管仓库，以及防风防雨防火防盗等粮食保护责任。
    抚州地委解决夏收夏种中劳力紧张问题的主要办法是：要求各生产大队实行专业包工责任制，组成夏收夏种专业组。夏收组包括收割和晒谷组。收割组包收包打，包由田间运回晒场；晒谷组包晒包扬，包运入仓。夏种组包括耕耙组和插秧组。耕耙组包翻地包耙地，包施底肥，包边收边耕；插秧组包拔秧，包合理密植，包边耕边插，包按时按质按量完成任务。此外，要求公社与公社、队与队之间还应开展劳力协作，以彻底解决劳力不足的困难。
    中共抚州地委要求各级党委根据上述办法和要求，进一步发动群众，因地制宜地定出本社、本队收好、管好，用好的具体办法和措施，以保证早稻丰产丰收。
