Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 30th: Many newspapers in the United Arab Republic have recently continuously published sensational news about the so-called subversive plots of the Iraqi Communist Party and internal divisions in Iraq.

    The "Voice of the Arabs" newspaper, published in Damascus, carried on the 27th so-called "important details of the conspiracy" of the Iraqi Communist Party to assassinate Iraqi government leaders. The "Republic" newspaper in Cairo also carried the same news on the 26th.

    Some newspapers openly expressed the hope that Iraqi Prime Minister Qasim would crack down on the Iraqi Communist Party. A commentary published in the Damascus "Voice of the Arabs" on the 24th said, what measures will Qasim take next to drive away the communists? "He is likely to give them a serious blow." Prior to this, this newspaper also said in an editorial published on June 2, "Why doesn't Qasim challenge the communists?" "Is he seriously fighting them?"

    The Damascus "Victory" newspaper also said in an editorial not long ago, "Unless Qasim launches a real war against the communists," people can only believe that "Iraq is not actually following a policy of positive neutrality."

    Some newspapers have also published many reports about the arrest of officers in Iraq. The Middle East News Agency reported on June 23 that Prime Minister Qasim ordered the arrest of twenty-three army officers "who participated in overthrowing the government," including Qasim's adjutant Taher and the head of military intelligence, Sheikh Ahmed. The news also said that the president of the Supreme Special Military Court, Mahdawi, "has resigned." However, two days later—June 25—Mahdawi presided over the trial of twenty-one officers and other prisoners who participated in the Mosul rebellion in Baghdad. Mahdawi also denied the news of the arrest of Taher and Sheikh Ahmed when speaking to newspaper reporters on June 27.

    阿联的许多报纸连续发表所谓伊拉克内部分裂的消息
    新华社30日讯　开罗消息：阿联的许多报纸最近连续发表所谓伊拉克共产党的颠覆阴谋和伊拉克内部发生分裂的耸人听闻的消息。
    在大马士革出版的“阿拉伯之声报”27日刊载了所谓伊拉克共产党要暗杀伊拉克政府领导人的“阴谋的重要细节”。开罗“共和国报”26日也刊载了同样的消息。
    一些报纸公开表示希望伊拉克总理卡塞姆对伊拉克共产党进行打击。大马士革“阿拉伯之声报”24日发表的评论说，卡塞姆下一步将采取什么措施来赶走共产党人呢？“他很可能给予他们一次严重的打击”。在这之前，这家报纸在6月2日发表的社论中也曾经说：“卡塞姆为什么不向共产党人挑战？”“他是否认真同他们进行斗争？”
    大马士革“胜利报”前不久在社论中也说，“除非卡塞姆对共产党人发动一场真正的战争”，否则人们只能相信“伊拉克实际上并没有遵循积极中立的方针。”
    一些报纸还发表了许多关于伊拉克逮捕军官的消息。中东通讯社在6月23日报道卡塞姆总理下令逮捕二十三名“参加推翻政府”的陆军军官，其中包括卡塞姆的副官塔赫尔和军事情报处处长谢赫·艾哈迈德。消息还说，最高特别军事法庭庭长马赫达维“已经辞职”。但是，过了两天——6月25日，马赫达维在巴格达主持了对参加摩苏尔叛乱的二十一名军官和其它犯人的审讯工作。马赫达维并在6月27日对报纸记者发表谈话时，否认了塔赫尔和谢赫·艾哈迈德被捕的消息。
