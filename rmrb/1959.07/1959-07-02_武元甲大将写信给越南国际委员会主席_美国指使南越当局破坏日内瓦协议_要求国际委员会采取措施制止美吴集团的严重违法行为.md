Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 1st: Senior Colonel Hà Văn Lâu, head of the Liaison Mission of the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army, held a press conference this afternoon to release the letter from General Võ Nguyên Giáp, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, to Mr. Ansari, Chairman of the International Control and Supervision Commission for Vietnam, dated June 25th.

In his letter, General Võ Nguyên Giáp systematically and comprehensively exposed the crimes of the United States in directing the South Vietnamese authorities to undermine the military provisions of the Geneva Accords, plotting to turn South Vietnam into a military base for the United States to launch new wars, and dragging South Vietnam into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc. He demanded that the International Commission take measures to stop the illegal actions of the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities. He solemnly pointed out that the United States must bear full responsibility for the consequences of its serious crimes, and the Vietnamese people will fight to the end to drive US imperialism out of South Vietnam.

Regarding the issue of illegal entry of US military personnel into South Vietnam, the letter pointed out: "At the time of the ceasefire, there were only two hundred US military advisors and military personnel in South Vietnam, but in recent years this number has increased to more than two thousand. The International Commission also stated in its ninth report to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference that, under the inspection of the International Commission, 759 more US military personnel entered South Vietnam in the two years of 1956 and 1957 alone." The letter said:

"Regarding the US Military Advisory Group, the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army believes it is necessary to emphasize once again that the presence of the US Military Advisory Group in South Vietnam based on the treaty concerning the military alliance signed in 1950 by the United States, France, and the Bảo Đại regime is a complete violation of the Geneva Accords. Because in legal terms, the Geneva Accords do not allow the South Vietnamese authorities to participate in or maintain any military alliance with foreign countries. Therefore, the US Military Advisory Group must withdraw from South Vietnam after the signing of the Geneva Accords." The letter said: "In reality, the US Military Advisory Group, the US Temporary Equipment Replacement Team, and their affiliated organizations are intensifying their activities to implement the new US war preparation plan in South Vietnam. For example, they directly undertake the organization, equipment, and training of the South Vietnamese army, direct the construction of South Vietnamese military bases and strategic highways, and in particular, US military advisors are also involved in suppressing and massacring the South Vietnamese people. For example, at the beginning of this year, more than one hundred US military advisors directly participated in the South Vietnamese army's mopping-up operations in the Hà Tiên-Rạch Giá area. The head of the US Military Advisory Group, Williams, participated in the mopping-up operations in Thủ Dầu Một after the Phú Lợi massacre. Recently, US military advisors, including Lieutenant Colonel Lister, participated in directing large-scale mopping-up operations in the Biên Hòa area."

Regarding the issue of the United States violating the Geneva Accords by transporting weapons and war materials into South Vietnam, the letter said: "Calculated solely in terms of water transport, 109 ships transported hundreds of thousands of tons of US weapons and war materials into South Vietnam in 1957; in 1958, the number of US ships transporting weapons to South Vietnam increased to 114. In terms of air transport, from 1956 to the present, almost every day military aircraft have been carrying US military personnel and war materials to Tân Sơn Nhất and Đà Nẵng airports in South Vietnam." The letter then pointed out: "Under the guise of aircraft belonging to the US Embassy in South Vietnam, the United States has openly dispatched more than a dozen reconnaissance aircraft, communication aircraft, and fighter aircraft to carry out activities in South Vietnam. This part of the US Air Force is actively preparing to allow more significant air force power to enter South Vietnam when necessary."

General Võ Nguyên Giáp emphasized in his letter: "The provision prohibiting the intensification of arms imports is likely to be violated even more severely. Because the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities are preparing to arm the South Vietnamese army with atomic weapons. Hundreds of South Vietnamese officers have already gone to the United States to learn how to use the atomic weapons, the 280mm cannon of the Wieke Platoon type, the 'Honest John' and 'Nike' missiles. Many US military and political figures, such as US Assistant Secretary of Defense Schaffner, have openly emphasized the so-called 'necessity of arming the South Vietnamese army with modern weapons.'"

Regarding the issue of expanding and building military bases in South Vietnam, the letter said:

"Under the guise of 'aid,' the South Vietnamese authorities have accepted US cash, equipment, and (military) personnel for several years in order to build a series of military bases and strategic highways in South Vietnam. (The head of the US 'Aid to Vietnam Mission' at the time,) Mr. Barross publicly declared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in early 1958 that these were 'crucial defensive strongholds for the United States in the event of war.'" The letter said: "They are accelerating the construction of the Saigon-Biên Hòa and Buôn Ma Thuột areas into US military bases in Southeast Asia. According to recent news, the United States is currently constructing several airports and deploying various types of military equipment in the Phú Quốc-Hà Tiên-Tri Tôn area in southwestern South Vietnam in order to threaten Cambodia from the south."

The letter said: "The purpose of building airports and highways in the Central Highlands of South Vietnam is to turn this area into an important strategic stronghold for the United States in Southeast Asia. This stronghold is adjacent to the central coastal area to the east, is connected to northern Laos via Highway 9, and in particular, is linked to Thailand, a member of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, through the highway from Attapeu to western Lower Laos, which is being accelerated."

The letter said: "The South Vietnamese authorities are plotting to expand their relationship with the US-led Southeast Asia military bloc, as admitted by South Vietnamese Foreign Minister Vũ Văn Mẫu on August 7, 1956, in Saigon, when he announced his acceptance of the (Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's) 'protection' and 'hope to join' (the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization)."

"This dark intention of the United States and the South Vietnamese authorities was also exposed in the speech of the acting Secretary-General of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, Australian General Worth, at the military conference of the bloc held in Baguio in November 1957. Worth declared: 'The Republic of Vietnam, with three observers attending the meeting, is considered to be the most qualified to become the ninth member of the alliance.'"

Võ Nguyên Giáp emphasized: "Another point worth noting is the bilateral agreements concluded under the guise of so-called 'cooperation' and 'friendship.' South Vietnam recently concluded a 'Cooperation Agreement on the Use of Atomic Energy' with the United States, a 'Friendship Agreement' with the Philippines, and several agreements with the Pote Sarasin government in order to obtain multi-faceted 'connections' including military aspects. These agreements are essentially a new development in the military collusion between South Vietnam and the United States, as well as the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization or various pro-American governments in the 'protected area' of this bloc."

Regarding the situation of invading the demilitarized zone and North Vietnamese airspace and territorial waters, the letter said: "By June 1959, the South Vietnamese armed forces had invaded the southern part of the demilitarized zone 144 times and violated the airspace and territorial waters of North Vietnam 51 times."

The letter said: "The above situation clearly proves that US imperialism and the South Vietnamese authorities have very seriously violated Articles 7, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 24 of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam and Articles 4, 5, and 12 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference."

The letter said: "The policy of intervention and challenge of US imperialism in South Vietnam is inseparable from the policy of US imperialism to undermine the peaceful neutrality of Cambodia and the conspiracy to instigate the Lao authorities to abandon the Geneva Accords and create a civil war in Laos, which has made the current situation in the region very tense."

The letter said: "The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has respected and strictly implemented the Geneva Accords, provided assistance and full cooperation to the International Control and Supervision Commission, and has repeatedly put forward peaceful initiatives to the South Vietnamese authorities to improve the situation and further unify the country. However, the South Vietnamese authorities, under the instigation and assistance of US imperialism, have adopted a completely opposite attitude."

The letter requested the International Commission to "make greater efforts to end this state of only one side respecting and implementing the Geneva Accords." The letter said:

"This state of affairs should not be delayed any longer."

General Võ Nguyên Giáp finally requested in his letter that the International Commission urge the South Vietnamese authorities to "(1) Stop all reinforcements of new US weapons, war materials, and military personnel into South Vietnam, and at the same time stop establishing and expanding military bases and strategic highways in South Vietnam; (2) Immediately order the military personnel of the US Military Assistance Advisory Group, the US Temporary Equipment Replacement Team, and other affiliated organizations to leave South Vietnam and sever all ties with the US-led Southeast Asia military alliance; (3) Fully implement the various provisions of the Geneva Accords, especially to end the policy of persecution and massacre of patriotic and peace-loving people that it is intensifying in South Vietnam to serve the challenging conspiracy of US imperialism; (4) Provide assistance and cooperation to the International Commission on the basis of the Geneva Accords, allowing the International Commission to investigate the cases of complaints raised by the Vietnamese People's Army."

    武元甲大将写信给越南国际委员会主席
    美国指使南越当局破坏日内瓦协议
    要求国际委员会采取措施制止美吴集团的严重违法行为
    新华社河内1日电　越南人民军总司令部联络代表团团长何文楼大校今天下午举行记者招待会，公布了越南人民军总司令武元甲大将6月25日给越南国际监察和监督委员会主席安萨里的信。
    武元甲大将在信中系统全面地揭露了美国指使南越当局破坏日内瓦协议的各项军事条款，阴谋把南越变成美国发动新战争的军事基地和把南越拖入东南亚侵略集团的罪行，要求国际委员会采取措施，制止美国和南越当局的违法行为，并严正指出，美国必须对它的严重罪行的后果负全部责任，越南人民将为促使美帝国主义滚出南越而斗争到底。
    关于美国军事人员非法进入南越的问题，信中指出：“停战时，在南越只有二百名美国军事顾问和军事人员，而几年来已增加到二千多名。国际委员会在寄给日内瓦会议的两位主席的第九次报告中也说，在国际委员会的检查下，仅在1956和1957两年中，又有七百五十九名美国军事人员进入南越。”信中说：
  “对于美国军事顾问团，越南人民军总司令部认为必须再一次强调指出，美国军事顾问团根据美国、法国和保大政权1950年签订的有关军事联盟的条约而留在南越是完全违反日内瓦协议的。因为在法理方面，日内瓦协议不容许南越当局参加或维持同外国的任何军事联盟。因此，美国军事顾问团必须在日内瓦协议签订之后撤出南越。”信中说：“实际上，美国军事顾问团、美国临时装备更新团以及它们的附设机构正在加强进行活动，以在南越实现美国新的备战计划。譬如他们直接担任南越军队的组织、装备和训练工作，指挥南越军事基地和战略公路的建设工作，特别是美国军事顾问还参与镇压、残杀南越人民的事件。如在今年年初一百多名美国军事顾问直接参加了南越军队在河仙—迪石地区的扫荡。美国军事顾问团团长威廉斯参加了富利惨案发生后在土龙木进行的扫荡。最近，包括里斯特中校的美国军事顾问，参加了指挥边和地区的大规模扫荡”。
    关于美国违反日内瓦协议把武器和战争物资运进南越的问题，信中说：“单从水运方面计算，1957年有一百零九艘轮船把成十万吨的美国武器和战争物资输入南越；1958年美国运送武器到南越的轮船增加到一百一十四艘次。在空运方面，从1956年到现在，几乎是每天都有军用飞机，把美国军事人员和战争物资载到南越的新山一和土伦机场。”信中接着指出：“以美国驻南越大使馆的飞机的名义，美国公然派了十多架侦察机、通讯机和战斗机等到南越进行活动。这部分美国空军正在积极进行准备工作，以便让更重要的空军力量在必要时进入南越活动。”
    武元甲大将在信中强调指出：关于禁止加紧输入武器的条款有可能遭到更严重的违反。因为，美国和南越当局正在准备以原子武器武装南越军队。成百名南越军官已经到美国学习使用原子武器韦克班长式二八○厘口径大炮、“诚实的约翰”式和“奈克”式导弹。美国许多军政界人物，如美国助理国防部长帮办夏夫曾经公然强调所谓“以现代化武器武装南越军队的必要性。”
    关于在南越扩建和兴建军事基地问题，信中说：
  “南越当局几年来在‘援助’的幌子下接受了美国的现款、器材和（军事）人员，以便在南越建设一系列的军事基地和战略公路。（当时美国“援助越南使团”团长）巴罗斯1958年初在参议院外交委员会公然宣称这是‘美国在战争发生时的具有关键性的防御据点’。”信中说：“他们正在加紧进行把西贡—边和和邦美蜀地区建设成为美国在东南亚的军事基地。据最近消息说：美国目前正在南越西南部的富国—河仙—知祖地区建设若干机场和安置许多种军事装备，以从南面威胁柬埔寨。”
    信中说：“在南越西原中部建设机场和公路的目的是为了把这个地区变成美国在东南亚的重要的战略据点。这个据点同中部东面沿海地区毗邻、经第九号公路同中寮北部取得联系，特别是通过阿速坡到下寮西部的正在加紧修建的公路同作为东南亚集团成员国的泰国连结起来。”
    信中说：“南越当局正在阴谋扩大同以美国为首的东南亚军事集团的关系，南越外交部长武文牡1956年8月7日在西贡宣布接受（东南亚集团）‘保护’和‘希望加入’（东南亚集团）时供认了这一点。”
    “美国和南越当局这种黑暗的意图也在东南亚集团代理秘书长、澳大利亚将领沃思1957年11月在这个集团在碧瑶召开的军事会议上的讲话中暴露无遗。沃思宣称：‘有三名观察员出席会议的越南共和国，被认为最有条件成为联盟的第九名成员’。”
    武元甲强调指出：“值得注意的另一点是在所谓‘合作’、‘友好’的幌子下缔结的双边协定。南越最近同美国缔结‘使用原子能合作协定’，同菲律宾签订‘友好协定’、同培·萨纳尼空政府签订若干项协定，以取得包括军事方面的多方面‘联系’。这些协定实质上是南越同美国以及东南亚集团或这个集团‘保护区域’之类的各亲美政府之间的军事勾结的新发展。”
    关于侵犯非军事区和北越领空、领海情况，信中说：“到1959年6月为止，南越的武装力量曾经侵入非军事区南段一百四十四次，侵犯越南民主共和国北方的领空和领海五十一次。”
    信中说：“上述情况清楚地证明了美帝国主义和南越当局非常严重地违反了越南停止敌对行动协定第七、十六、十七、十八、十九和二十四条以及日内瓦会议最后宣言第四、五和十二条。”
    信中说：“美帝国主义在南越的干涉和挑战政策，同美帝国主义破坏柬埔寨的和平中立政策和唆使老挝当局背弃日内瓦协议，在老挝制造内战的阴谋是分不开的，它使当前这个地区的局势变得非常紧张。”
    信中说：“越南民主共和国政府已经尊重和严正履行了日内瓦协议，对国际监察和监督委员会给以帮助和充分合作，曾经多次向南越当局提出了改善局势，并进而统一国家的和平倡议。但是南越当局在美帝国主义的唆使和帮助下，采取了完全相反的态度。”
    信中要求国际委员会“作出更大努力结束这种只是一个方面尊重和履行日内瓦协议的状态”。信中说：
  “这种状态是不应该再拖延下去的。”
    武元甲大将在信中最后要求国际委员会促使南越当局“（一）停止把美国对南越新的武器、战争物资和军事人员的一切增援运入南越，同时停止在南越建立和扩大军事基地和战略公路；（二）立刻要美国军事援助顾问团、美国临时装备更新团的军事人员和其他附属组织离开南越，断绝同以美国为首的东南亚军事联盟的一切关系；（三）充分实施日内瓦协议的各项条款，特别是结束它正在南越加紧进行的、为美帝国主义的挑战阴谋服务的迫害和屠杀爱国和爱和平人民的政策；（四）在日内瓦协议的基础上对国际委员会给以帮助和合作，让国际委员会就越南人民军方面曾经提出控诉的案件进行调查。
