Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 4th -- Hubei Province is vigorously grasping field management of oil crops in various places, striving for a bumper harvest of peanuts, sesame, and soybeans.

    At present, the sowing of autumn oil crops in Hubei Province has ended. Generally, the growth is good, and the earlier planted peanuts have already flowered, which is a critical period for cultivation management to strive for a bumper harvest. Various places are vigorously grasping intertillage and soil cultivation, weeding, and topdressing to promote peanuts to set needles and bear fruit in large quantities. Hongan County, famous throughout the country for peanut production, has weeded and fertilized all of its more than 30,000 mu of peanuts this year. The cultivation management of peanuts by the commune members is more practical and meticulous than in the past, and the peanuts are growing strong and tender. Many production teams in Macheng, Luotian and other counties have generally cultivated the soil around peanuts, and used plant ash and superphosphate to supply the phosphorus and potassium fertilizers needed for peanut fruiting. Xiangyang County, which has a large sesame planting area, is currently grasping sesame seedling management. Some communes have implemented the practice of three weedings, three topdressings, and three insect controls to strive for a bumper sesame harvest. In order to strengthen the roots and leaves of sesame in Jianli County, each production team has fixed special teams to weed and thin seedlings, clear ditches to prevent collapse. Some communes have also carried out timely pest control for soybeans that have already been infested.

    Hubei Province is one of the provinces in China that abounds in oil crops. However, due to the past thinking of farmers emphasizing grain and cotton over oil crops, they did not pay enough attention to field management of oil crops. This year, while rushing to plant autumn oil crops, various places adopted the method of planting and managing at the same time. After the sowing ended, many areas immediately launched a field management upsurge.
    According to the Sichuan Daily, in order to make peanuts set more needles, bear more pods, and bear large pods, and to ensure a bumper harvest of spring oil crops this year, the Provincial Department of Agriculture held a provincial peanut field management symposium in Ziyang County, a major peanut producing area, from June 22 to 23 to exchange production experience.

    This year, the province's peanut planting area has increased significantly compared with last year, and the sowing quality has also improved compared with last year. At present, the growth is generally good. Early-planted peanuts have begun to set needles, and late-planted peanuts have also entered the flowering period. Timely strengthening of peanut field management is the key to winning a bumper harvest.
    The representatives who participated in the Ziyang meeting first visited different types of peanut fields in the Ziyang County Farm, Nanshi Commune, and Hongqi Commune, and listened to the introduction of experience in crop cultivation. In their speeches, the representatives from various places used facts to illustrate that as long as they establish high-yield thinking, the enthusiasm of the masses will become greater and greater, and with good field management, a bumper harvest can be guaranteed.
    In order to increase the needle setting rate to more than 20 needles per plant and reduce empty shells and immature pods to below 30%, the meeting believed that the following measures should be tightly grasped at present: First, vigorously grasp topdressing during the flowering period. According to years of experiments and bumper harvest experience, applying plant ash during the flowering period can increase production by about 30% (applying manure water also has a very good effect). For peanut fields with good growth, 100 to 150 jin of plant ash should be applied per mu, sprinkled on the leaves in the morning before the dew dries; for those with poor growth, about 30 loads of pig manure water should be applied per mu. When there is a shortage of manure water, dry manure can also be applied. Second, promptly check seedlings and cut off the main stem. This can reduce nutrient consumption, facilitate ventilation and light transmission, and increase the number of needles and pods. According to experiments, it is generally expected to increase production by 10%-15%. For better-growing main stems, cut off from one inch above the ground; for general growth, only the tip of the main stem should be cut off; for poor growth, it may not be cut. Third, universally cultivate soil and press vines. This can advance needle setting and promote pod formation. According to experiments, it can increase yield by 20%-30%. Soil cultivation is best when a large number of needles are set about 25 days after flowering. Soil cultivation should be carried out by methods such as piling mud and spreading soil, depending on the density. The time for pressing vines should be half a month after flowering, and creeping peanuts can also be pressed with sun mats. In addition, intertillage, weeding, irrigation, and drainage also have a great effect on increasing peanut production, and these measures should be followed step by step.

    The meeting called on all localities to strengthen peanut field management, while making use of the front and back of houses, making the most of every bit of space, and launching a campaign for everyone to plant peanuts or sesame and strive to produce an extra five jin of oil.
Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 4th -- The people's communes in Qihe County, Shandong Province, are changing the past rough field management habits of soybeans, peanuts and other oil crops, and are launching a mass competition movement to manage early, manage well, and strive for overproduction and bumper harvest of oil crops.

    This year, the county has planted a total of 265,000 mu of soybeans, 26,000 mu of peanuts, and replanted 7,100 mu of sesame. Various agencies, factories, schools, and commune members' families have also used small scattered plots of land to plant a large number of oil crops. The Qihe County Party Committee and the Party committees of various communes mobilized the masses to summarize and recall the typical high-yield experience of soybeans and peanuts last year, dig out the roots of low yield, find ways to increase production, and mobilize the enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and masses to increase oil production. At present, the county has fixed 23,000 people to be specifically responsible for the field management of oil crops, implementing "four-to-the-field" for output, measures, work points, and personnel. High-yield plots have formulated management operating procedures, and the county and communes have also trained three to five oil management technicians for each production team, responsible for guiding field management.
    The competition movement to strive for high-yield and bumper harvest of oil crops has been initially launched throughout the county. In some communes, not only competitions are carried out between teams, high-yield plots, and blocks, but also between individual commune members.

    In order to better guide the development of the movement, the county has been divided into four competition areas, with the county party secretary and standing committee members taking the lead, and fixed personnel to engage in experimental fields and high-yield plots. The county, communes, and teams have a total of 2,616 high-yield plots of soybeans and peanuts, and more than 5,000 mu of experimental fields, so as to promote the overall increase in oil crop production through these fields.

    扩大油料作物面积　提高单位面积产量
    种好管好花生芝麻大豆
    湖北加紧锄草施肥　四川交流先进经验　山东齐河开展竞赛
    新华社武汉4日电　湖北省各地大抓油料作物的田间管理，力争花生、芝麻、大豆样样丰收。
    目前，湖北省秋收油料作物的播种已经结束。一般生长良好，播种较早的花生已经开花，正是培育管理争取丰收的关键时期。各地正在大抓中耕培土，锄草追肥，以促进花生大量下针结果。以花生生产闻名全国的红安县，今年播种的三万多亩花生，已经全部锄了草，追了肥。社员们对花生的培育管理比过去踏实、细致，花生长得青壮肥嫩。麻城、罗田等县许多生产队对花生普遍培了土，并用草木灰、过磷酸钙壅兜，以供给花生结果所需的磷、钾肥料。芝麻种植面积较大的襄阳县，目前正大抓芝麻苗期管理。有的公社实行了连除三道草、连追三道肥、连治三道虫的作法，争取芝麻丰收。监利县为了使芝麻根壮叶茂，各生产队都固定了专门班子，锄草间苗，清沟防溃。有些公社还对已经发生虫害的大豆，及时地进行了治虫工作。
    湖北省是我国盛产油料作物的省分之一。但是，由于过去农民有重粮棉轻油料的思想，所以对油料作物的田间管理不够重视。今年，各地在抢播秋季油料作物的同时，采取了边种边管的方法，播种结束以后，许多地区立即掀起了田间管理热潮。
    据四川日报消息　四川省为了使花生多下针，多结荚、结大荚，确保今年大春油料作物大丰收，省农业厅于6月22日至23日，在盛产花生的资阳县，召开了全省花生田间管理座谈会，交流了生产经验。
    今年全省花生播种面积比去年大大增加，播种质量也比去年提高。目前生长一般良好，早播花生已开始下针，迟播花生也已进入开花时期，及时加强花生田间管理是夺取大丰收的关键。
    这次参加资阳会议的代表们首先参观了资阳县农场、南市公社和红旗公社不同类型的花生地，听了有关作物栽培的经验介绍。各地代表在发言中，都用事实说明，只要树立高产思想，群众的干劲就会越来越大，而田间管理抓好了，大丰收就有保证。
    为了提高下针率，作到每株花生下针二十个以上，把空壳、水子压低到30％以下，会议认为当前应紧紧抓住如下措施：一、大抓花期追肥，根据历年试验和大丰收经验，花期施草木灰可以增产30％左右（追施水粪也有很好的效果）。对于生长较好的花生地，每亩应施草木灰一百斤到一百五十斤，在早晨露水未干时撒在叶子面上；生长较差的，每亩增施猪粪水三十挑左右，缺粪水时也可以用干粪撒施。二、及时看苗割主茎。这可以减少养分的消耗，利于通风透光，提高下针结实数。据试验，一般可望增产10％—15％。生长较好的主茎，从离地面一寸处割去，生长一般的，只宜割去主茎尖，生长坏的可以不割。三、普遍培土压蔓。这可以提早下针，促进结荚。据试验，可提高产量20％—30％。在开花后二十五天左右大量下针时进行培土，效果最好。培土应根据稀密不同情况，采用壅泥和撒土等办法。压蔓时间在开花后半个月为宜，蔓生型花生还可以用晒席压蔓。此外，中耕除草、灌溉排水，对花生增产作用也很大，这些措施都应步步跟上。
    会议号召各地在加强花生田间管理的同时，利用屋前屋后，见缝插针，开展一个每人种植花生或芝麻，力争多产五斤油的运动。
    新华社济南4日电　山东齐河县各人民公社改变过去大豆、花生等油料作物田间管理粗放的习惯，正在掀起一个群众性的管早、管好、争取油料超产丰收的竞赛运动。
    今年，这个县共种大豆二十六万五千亩，花生二万六千亩，补种芝麻七千一百亩，各机关、工厂、学校和社员家庭，还利用小片零星地种植了大量油料作物。中共齐河县委和各公社党委发动群众总结回忆了去年大豆、花生的典型丰产经验，挖低产根，找增产门，调动广大干部和群众增产油料的积极性。目前全县已固定两万三千人专门负责油料作物的田间管理，实行产量、措施、工分、人员“四到田”，丰产方都制定了管理操作规程，县和公社还为每个生产队训练了三名到五名油料管理技术人员，负责指导田间管理工作。
    现在争取油料高产丰收的竞赛运动已在全县初步展开，有些公社，不仅队与队、丰产方与丰产方、块与块之间开展了竞赛，社员个人之间也开展了竞赛。
    为了更好地指导运动的发展，全县已划为四个竞赛区，县委书记、常委分头挂帅，并且固定专人大搞试验田、丰产方。县、社、队共搞大豆、花生丰产方二千六百一十六块，试验田五千多亩，以便通过这些田带动油料作物全面增产。（附图片）
