    Record Speed
    Old records were all 78 rpm. One record could only play for five or six minutes. Therefore, recording a large piece of music often required four to six records (eight to twelve sides). For music lovers, the frequent record changes and the inability to listen to the entire piece in one go was the most troublesome thing.
    Since the advent of microgroove records with slower speeds, the trouble of frequent record changes has been solved. Now record speeds include 78, 45, 33 1/3, and 16 2/3 rpm.
    The so-called 78, 45, 33 1/3... rpm refers to the speed of a record per minute. For the same 25 cm record, the capacity of 33 1/3 rpm is five or six times more than 78 rpm, and 16 2/3 rpm is nearly ten times more. In other words, the playing time of six 78 rpm records is equivalent to the playing time of one 33 1/3 rpm record. The records we commonly use now are all 78 rpm, which are suitable for general gramophones and electric record players.
    A 33 1/3 rpm record can play for 25 to 40 minutes on both sides, which is most suitable for recording large-scale musical works. This type of record is not only much more convenient to use than 78 rpm, but also avoids the surface noise of 78 rpm records due to raw materials and precise recording, making it clear and pleasant to listen to. However, this type of record must be used on record players with the above-mentioned speed settings, and the stylus must also be more precise than those used in ordinary record players.
    45 rpm and 16 2/3 rpm records are both "new products" in record production in recent years. The 45 rpm records currently popular in the world are all small records with a diameter of 17 cm, which can play for about ten to twelve minutes. This type of record mostly records light music and small and medium-sized musical pieces. Because of its small size, light weight, and resistance to breakage, it is very popular. Czechoslovakia is one of the first countries to create this type of record.
    It takes about an hour to play a 16 2/3 rpm record, which is currently the slowest speed and densest groove music record in the world. This type of record made in China has recently been produced. These two types of records must also be used on record players with the above-mentioned speed settings. (Yu Zhenghe)

### 唱片的转速

    唱片的转速
    过去的唱片都是78转的。一张只能放唱五、六分钟，因而灌制一首大型乐曲，往往要用四至六张（八至十二面），这对于音乐欣赏者来讲，频繁的换片和不能一气呵成的听完全曲，算是件最头痛的事了。
    自从密纹慢转唱片问世后，频繁换片的麻烦就解决了。现在唱片的转速，已有78、45、33 1/3、16 2/3等转了。
    所谓78、45、33 1/3……转；就是指一张唱片每分钟的转速。同样一张25公分的唱片，33 1/3转的容量比78转的多五、六倍，而16 2/3转的多近十倍，也就是说，六张78转唱片的放唱时间，相等于一张33 1/3转的放唱时间。现在我们普遍用的唱片，都是78转的，它适用于一般的留声机和电唱机。
    33 1/3转的唱片，二面可放唱二十五分至四十分钟，最适宜灌制大型的乐曲。这种唱片，不但在使用上比78转的方便得多，而且由于原料及录制精密等原因，而避免了78转唱片中的沙声，听起来清晰悦耳。但是这种唱片必须用在具有上述转速装置的，唱针也必须精密于普通唱机所用的。
    45转和16 2/3转的唱片，都是近年来唱片生产中的“新产品”。现在世界上流行的45转唱片，都是直径17公分的小唱片，它可以放唱十至十二分钟左右。这种唱片，多半灌制些轻音乐和中小型的乐曲，由于它的体积小，轻便不碎，所以很受人们欢迎，捷克斯洛伐克是首创这种唱片国家之一。
    放唱完一张16 2/3的唱片，要花一个小时左右，这是目前世界上转速最慢、片纹最密的音乐片，我国灌制的这种唱片最近已出产。这二种唱片也必须用在具有上述转速的唱机上。　（俞正和）
