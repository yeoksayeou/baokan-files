    Making close friends among the masses is an excellent tradition of the proletarian revolutionary party. The proletarian revolutionary teacher Lenin maintained close contact with the peasants even when he was exiled to the village of Shushenskoye, and made many close friends. When Lenin lived abroad, he often contacted workers, attended workers' conferences, and carefully studied the life of the working class and the workers' movement. This working method of making close friends was also widely developed in our country's long-term revolutionary struggle under the earnest teachings of Chairman Mao. As everyone knows, in the past land reform struggle, when we mobilized the poor and lower-middle peasants, we generally adopted the working methods of visiting the poor and asking about their sufferings, and striking roots and establishing connections. That is, through making close friends to make a breakthrough at one point and drive the overall situation, we extensively mobilized the masses. This is a successful experience in mobilizing the masses. Now, in socialist construction, this experience has been further developed. This is the widespread adoption of methods such as "eating, living, and working together" and establishing fixed contact points to make close friends with the masses and extensively connect with the masses.

    Why is making close friends with the masses a good way to implement the mass line?

    First, it has the characteristic of treating people equally, and it is easy to understand the opinions and requirements of the masses. Making friends means appearing as an ordinary laborer. Cadres and the masses, like old friends, can chat casually and exchange ideas. This makes the masses feel that the relationship between cadres and the masses is indeed equal, and that you have given your heart to them, so they regard you as a close friend. They can talk to you about everything and tell you everything, and give you ideas. The Party Secretary of Tangchi Commune in Lujiang County made thirty-six close friends in six production teams in order to deeply understand the opinions of all parties. Through chatting, he learned a lot of situations that were not easily understood in the past, helped the masses solve many practical problems, and won praise from the masses. Obviously, if you do not appear as an ordinary laborer and treat people equally, the masses will not casually tell you their innermost thoughts, and some problems will not be easily understood, and of course it will be difficult to solve them.

    Second, making close friends with the masses is also a good working method that combines points and surfaces, and moves from the individual to the general. We often say that we must stand firm on the working-class stand and educate the peasants; but if we do not understand the working class and the peasant class, and are not familiar with their lives and thoughts, can we do our work well? And the working class and the peasant class are not abstract things, but are composed of countless individual workers and individual peasants. The general exists in the individual. Chairman Mao pointed out in "On Contradiction": "As far as the order of human cognition is concerned, it always expands from recognizing individual and special things to recognizing general things. People always first recognize the special essence of many different things, and then it is possible to further carry out generalization work and recognize the common essence of various things." He also said, "After people have recognized this common essence, they use this common understanding as a guide to continue to study various specific things that have not yet been studied or have not been studied in depth, find out their special essence, so that they can supplement, enrich and develop the understanding of this common essence." Chairman Mao clearly told us here that to understand the general, we must first understand the specific; and after understanding the general, we must continue to understand the specific, so that our understanding can be enriched. If we want to understand the workers and peasants and be familiar with them, we must start from the individual and from making friends. This is similar to the working methods we usually use to create "experimental fields" and dissect a sparrow.

    Making close friends with the masses is not only a working method that we should often adopt, but also has profound practical significance for the current consolidation and improvement of the people's communes. Because the leadership responsibility of the people's commune, which combines government and commune, is much heavier than that of the past single agricultural society or grass-roots political power, and there are many new issues in the management, organization of production and life of the commune; and now the main leading cadres at the commune level are mostly the original county, district and township cadres, and some of them are not very familiar with the local situation, including the local agricultural production situation. Therefore, to do a good job in the production and work of the commune, we must rely on local cadres and the people. That is to say, when the commune decides on major issues, it should not only absorb the main responsible cadres of each production brigade, and even the production team, to participate; but also should directly make close friends with the masses and seek advice from them. In this way, the commune cadres, local cadres, and the people can be well combined and twisted into one rope to quickly advance the various undertakings of the commune.

### 在群众中交知心朋友

    在群众中交知心朋友
    和群众交知心朋友是无产阶级革命政党的优良传统。无产阶级的革命导师列宁，甚至在流放到寿山斯克村时，还同农民保持着密切的联系，交了不少知心朋友。列宁在侨居国外时，经常和工人联系，参加工人的大会，仔细研究工人阶级的生活和工人运动。这种交知心朋友的工作方法，在我国长期的革命斗争中，在毛主席的谆谆教导下，也得到了广泛的发展。大家都知道，在过去土地改革斗争中，我们在发动贫雇农群众时，普遍采取了访贫问苦，扎根串连的工作方法。也就是通过交知心朋友突破一点、带动全盘，广泛地发动群众。这是一条发动群众的成功经验。现在，在社会主义建设中，这条经验又有了新的发展，这就是各地普遍采用的，通过“同吃、同住、同劳动”以及固定联系基点等办法与群众交知心朋友，广泛地联系群众。
    为什么说和群众交知心朋友，是贯彻群众路线的一种好方法呢？
    第一，它具有平等待人的特点，容易了解群众的意见和要求。交朋友是以普通劳动者身份出现的，干部与群众，像老朋友一样，随便谈心，交流思想情况。这就使群众亲切感到干群之间的关系，确实是平等的，感到你的心是交给他的，因而把你当成知心朋友。能对你无话不谈，无事不讲，并为你出主意。庐江县汤池公社党委书记为了深入了解各方面的意见，在六个生产队中，结交了三十六个知心朋友。通过闲谈，他了解到不少过去不容易了解到的情况，帮助群众解决了很多实际问题，得到群众的好评。很明显，如果不以普通劳动者的身份出现，平等待人，群众就不会随便地对你讲知心话，有些问题就不容易了解到，当然很难去解决了。
    第二，和群众交知心朋友，也是一种点面结合、从个别到一般的好的工作方法。我们经常说要站稳工人阶级立场，要教育农民；但是我们如果不了解工人阶级和农民阶级，不熟悉他们的生活和思想；那末，我们能很好地进行工作么？而工人阶级、农民阶级都不是抽象的东西，都是由无数个别的工人、个别的农民组成起来的。一般存在于个别之中。毛主席在“矛盾论”中指出：“就人类认识运动的秩序说来，总是由认识个别的和特殊的事物，逐步地扩大到认识一般的事物。人们总是首先认识了许多不同事物的特殊的本质，然后才有可能更进一步地进行概括工作，认识诸种事物的共同的本质。”还说“当着人们已经认识了这种共同的本质以后，就以这种共同的认识为指导，继续地向着尚未研究过的或者尚未深入地研究过的各种具体的事物进行研究，找出其特殊的本质，这样才可以补充、丰富和发展这种共同的本质的认识。”毛主席在这里明确地告诉我们，要认识一般的东西，首先要认识具体的东西；而认识了一般的东西，还要继续去认识具体的东西，这样才能使我们的认识更加丰富起来。我们要了解工人、农民，熟悉他们，就必须从个别开始，从交朋友开始。这与我们通常运用的搞“试验田”、解剖一个麻雀的工作方法有类似的地方。
    和群众交知心朋友不仅是我们应该经常采用的工作方法，而且对于当前的巩固和提高人民公社也有深刻的现实意义。因为政社合一的人民公社的领导责任，要比过去的单一的农业社或基层政权繁重得多，在公社管理和组织生产、生活等方面有着不少新的课题；而现在公社一级的主要领导干部，又大部分是原来的县区乡干部，他们中有些人对当地的情况，包括对当地农业生产情况，还不太熟悉。因此，要搞好公社的生产和工作，必须要依靠当地干部，依靠人民群众。这就是说，公社在决定重大问题的时候，不仅应该吸收各个生产大队、甚至生产队的主要负责干部参加；而且还应该直接在群众中交知心朋友，向他们求谋问计。这样，就能把公社干部和当地干部以及人民群众很好地结合起来，扭成一股劲，迅速地把公社的各项事业向前推进。
