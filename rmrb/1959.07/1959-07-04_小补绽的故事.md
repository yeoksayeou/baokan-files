    The Story of a Small Patch
    While on a business trip to Xiangfan City, I suddenly tore a small hole in the knee of my trousers. I couldn't find anyone to do laundry that night, nor anyone to mend it. And tomorrow, I had to rush to Nanzhang. Just as I was struggling, the service staff at the hostel told me, "Comrade, you can go to the Xidajie Sewing Factory; they can use a machine to mend it for you." "A small patch mended by machine?" I didn't quite believe it. The service staff explained, "That's a factory run by housewives; besides making clothes, they also mend old clothes for the public." I found the factory with curiosity, and sure enough, there were several customers waiting to have their shirt collars replaced or their clothes mended. A woman found a scrap of fabric and took my torn pants to the machine to mend. It is said that this sewing factory is entirely organized by housewives who use leftover scraps from making clothes to serve customers. For example, replacing a shirt collar costs only two jiao, and mending a patch costs only a few fen. My pants, because the hole was small and difficult to calculate, cost nothing at all, which is truly a novel way to make things convenient for people.

    小补绽的故事
    我出差到襄樊市，忽然长裤的膝盖头破了个小洞。晚上找不到洗衣服的，也没有人补，而明天，我又要赶到南漳去。正为难时，招待所的服务员告诉我：“同志，你可到西大街缝纫厂去，她们会用机器替你补的。”“小补绽用机器补？”我不大信。服务员解释说：“那是一所家庭妇女办的工厂，她们除了做成衣外，顺便还替群众补旧。”我怀着好奇的心找到了那个工厂，果然有好几个顾客等着换衬衣领，或是织补衣服破绽。有位妇女找了一块零头布角，把我的破裤拿到机器上去补。据说，这个缝纫厂全是家庭妇女组织起来的，她们利用做成衣剩下的零碎布，为顾客服务。例如换一个衬衣领只收两角，补个补绽只收几分钱。我的裤子因为破洞小，不便计算，一文不要，这真是与人方便的新鲜事。
