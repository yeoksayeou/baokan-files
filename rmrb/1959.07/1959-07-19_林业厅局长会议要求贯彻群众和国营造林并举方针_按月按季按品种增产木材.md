Xinhua News Agency, 18th: Forestry production and construction work continues to leap forward. In the first half of this year, the country has made great achievements in both afforestation and timber production. The area of afforestation is equivalent to last year, but the quality has improved; timber production has increased by 41.5% compared with the same period last year.

From June 25 to July 14, the Ministry of Forestry held a national meeting of forestry bureau directors in Beijing to review the work of the first half of the year and discuss issues related to afforestation and timber production. At the meeting, representatives from various provinces and regions expressed great enthusiasm for continuing to mobilize the masses to carry out large-scale afforestation and "four-sides" (alongside water sources, villages, roads, and houses) planting, and striving to produce more timber to support industrial and agricultural production and basic construction.

According to a preliminary review of the meeting: In the first half of this year, the achievements of afforestation across the country, especially in the South, were significant. In January, February, and March, the mass movement for afforestation and some state-owned afforestation work in some southern provinces and regions developed well. This year, due to the relatively tight labor force, the scale of "four-sides" planting was not as large as last year, but the quantity was still considerable. Due to the preparations made by various provinces and regions last autumn and winter in terms of seed collection, seedling cultivation, and afforestation technology, the quality of afforestation was better than last year. Many regions have attached importance to creating timber forests, and some southern regions have planted large areas of fast-growing timber species.

The meeting pointed out that afforestation is not only for greening, but more importantly, to meet the country's growing demand for timber in the future. Therefore, creating timber forests, especially fast-growing timber species, is very important. In the future, afforestation must continue to implement the policy of simultaneously pursuing mass afforestation and state-owned afforestation. On the one hand, strengthen the leadership of mass afforestation work, rely on the strength of the people's communes, widely mobilize the masses to plant trees and afforest, and stipulate that the trees planted by the masses on scattered open spaces in front of and behind houses belong to those who plant them. At the same time, it is necessary to especially emphasize running the forest farms run by people's communes at all levels well. On the other hand, actively develop state-owned afforestation, accelerate the pace of greening, expand timber forest bases, and drive mass afforestation. In afforestation, various localities can, according to plans and local conditions, create timber forests, shelter forests, economic forests, fuel forests, etc.

The meeting believes that provinces and cities lacking timber, such as Hebei, Shanxi, Liaoning, Henan, Shandong, Shaanxi, Gansu, Anhui, Jiangsu, Beijing, and Shanghai, should especially strengthen the planned creation of timber forests and carry out greening movements in different mountainous areas. These provinces and cities have large populations and a large demand for timber; in the past, timber was mainly transferred from other provinces, and long-distance transportation wasted transportation resources, increased costs, and supply was not timely. In the future, these provinces and cities must actively accelerate the construction of their own timber forest bases based on their needs and local conditions, create fast-growing tree species such as poplar, willow, elm, Chinese tallow tree, paulownia, and Chinaberry, and combine urban greening and scattered "four-sides" planting to solve the general civilian timber, fuel timber, and packaging materials needed by the market locally. In the vicinity of mining areas, it is even more necessary to vigorously create pit prop forests to solve the pit props needed for mining locally.

The meeting believes that strengthening young forest tending work and improving the survival rate and growth rate of young forests is the key to current afforestation work. The area of afforestation in the past two years has been very large, but due to the shortage of labor, summer tending work has not kept up, and the survival rate is not high enough. This summer, various localities and people's communes must mobilize all possible forces to tend young forests. Areas with conditions can promote intercropping of forests and grains to achieve a double harvest of forests and grains. In order to effectively manage and protect young forests, it is necessary to actively promote the system of assigning specific areas and sections to specific personnel for responsibility. The meeting believes that doing a good job in young forest tending work does not require much labor; about 2%-3% of the rural labor force can specialize in tending. The meeting hopes that various localities and people's communes will seriously solve the labor force needed for young forest tending work, contract out the tending work, and ensure that the young forests and scattered trees planted in the past two years grow up. The meeting requires that various localities, especially the southern forest areas, further implement the mountain production policy. People's communes and forest farms in forest areas should pay attention to developing forestry production and implementing diversified operations of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. In addition to timber production, forest areas must also pay attention to developing diverse forest sideline industries such as rosin, tanning extract, wood ear, mushrooms, and hunting.

The meeting emphasized that the third quarter is a decisive season for this year's timber production. Various localities must vigorously mobilize the enthusiasm of forestry workers and members of people's communes in forest areas, further carry out the movement to increase production and conserve timber, vigorously promote technical revolution, improve the utilization rate of existing machinery and tools, and promote effective local methods such as timber transport slides in southern mountainous areas, in order to complete timber production tasks by month, quarter, and timber variety, and strive to produce more pit props and sleepers to support the coal industry and railway construction. The meeting pointed out that it is the primary task of current forestry work to go all out, overcome all difficulties, and complete timber production tasks. In addition, it is also necessary to achieve timely transportation and ensure supply. At present, various localities should focus on timber transportation work. Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, and other regions should make full use of the favorable transportation conditions in the third quarter and actively organize rush transportation. Southern provinces should also take advantage of the favorable opportunity of abundant rainfall and large streams to transport the timber that has been felled and exists on mountains and along streams to the banks of large rivers. The meeting requires that local forestry bureaus should strengthen enterprise management and establish sound rules and regulations. For existing machinery and equipment, maintenance and repair should be strengthened, attention should be paid to safety during the production process, and all logging units should do a good job of renewal. In order to adapt to the development of the forest industry, the meeting requires various localities to actively prepare for the development of new forest areas, vigorously grasp planning and design and basic construction work, continue to develop lumber production, and develop the wood-based panel industry and the forest chemical industry.

The meeting also made detailed discussions on issues such as how people's communes should operate and manage forests, the different priorities of forestry production and construction work in different regions of the country, and the proportion that forestry production should have in various localities, and put forward some suggestions.

    林业厅局长会议要求贯彻群众和国营造林并举方针
    按月按季按品种增产木材
    新华社18日讯　林业生产建设工作正在继续跃进。今年上半年全国造林和木材生产都已取得很大成就。造林面积相当于去年，但质量有所提高；木材生产较去年同期增长了41.5％。
    6月25日到7月14日，林业部在北京召开全国林业厅、局长会议，检查了上半年的工作，并对今后有关造林和木材生产各方面的问题进行了讨论。会上，各省、区代表对于继续发动群众大片造林和四旁（水旁、村旁、路旁、屋旁）植树，努力生产更多的木材支援工农业生产和基本建设，都表现了很大的积极性。
    据会议初步检查：今年上半年，全国特别是南方造林的成绩是巨大的。1、2、3月间，南方有些省区，造林的群众运动和部分国营造林工作都有较好的发展。今年由于劳动力较紧张，四旁植树规模不如去年，但数量也不小。由于去年秋冬各省、区对采种、育苗和造林技术作了一定准备，造林质量比去年好些。不少地区重视了造用材林，南方有些地区植造了大片速生树种的用材林。
    会议指出，造林不仅为了绿化，更重要的是为了满足今后国家日益增长的对木材的需要。因此造用材林，特别是速生树种的用材林很重要。今后造林仍须贯彻群众造林与国营造林并举的方针。一方面加强对群众造林工作的领导，依靠人民公社的力量，广泛地发动群众植树造林，规定群众利用屋前屋后零星空地种植的树木谁种谁有。同时要特别强调办好人民公社各级所办的林场。另一方面，也要积极发展国营造林，加快绿化速度和扩大用材林基地，并带动群众造林。在造林中，各地可根据规划，因地制宜地营造用材林、防护林、经济林、薪炭林等等。
    会议认为：河北、山西、辽宁、南河、山东、陕西、甘肃、安徽、江苏、北京、上海等缺少木材的省、市，尤应加强有计划的营造用材林和分别不同山区开展山区的绿化运动。这些省、市人口多，木材需用量大；过去用材主要从外省调用，长途调运既浪费运输力量，又加大了成本，供应还不能及时。今后这些省、市必须根据需要和本地区的具体条件，积极加速建设自己的用材林基地，营造杨、柳、榆、乌桕、泡桐、苦栋等速生树种的林木，并结合城市绿化和四旁零星植树，就地解决市场所需的一般民用材、薪炭材和包装材等。矿区附近更需大力营造坑木林，就地解决采矿所需的坑木。
    会议认为：加强幼林抚育工作，提高幼林成活率和生长速度，是当前造林工作的关键。去今两年造林面积很大，因劳力紧张，夏季抚育工作跟不上，成活率不够高。今年夏季各地各人民公社须动员一切可能动员的力量抚育幼林，有条件的地区可以推广林粮间种，达到林粮双丰收。为了有效地管理和保护幼林，必须积极推行划片分段、专人负责的制度。会议认为：作好幼林抚育工作，需要的劳动力并不多，约占农村2％—3％的劳动力专业抚育就可以。会议希望各地各人民公社认真解决一下幼林抚育工作所需的劳动力，把抚育工作包工落实，使去今两年所造的幼林和零星植树成长起来。会议要求各地特别是南方林区进一步贯彻执行山区生产方针。林区人民公社和林场要注意发展林业生产和实行农、林、牧、副、渔多种经营。林区除木材生产外，还须注意发展松香、拷胶、木耳、蘑菇、狩猎等多种多样的林副业生产。
    会议强调第三季度是今年木材生产具有决定性的季节。各地必须大力发动林业职工和林区人民公社社员的积极性，进一步开展木材生产的增产节约运动，大闹技术革命，提高现有机具的利用率和推广南方山区运材滑道等有效的土法，以求按月按季按木材品种完成木材生产任务，争取生产更多的坑木、枕木，支援煤炭工业和铁路建筑。会议指出：鼓足干劲，战胜一切困难，完成木材生产任务是当前林业工作的首要问题，此外还要做到及时调运，保证供应。目前，各地应抓紧木材运输工作。东北、内蒙古等地区要充分利用第三季度交通运输较有利的情况，积极组织抢运。南方各省也要利用现在雨水多，溪流大的有利时机，把已伐的存在山上和溪流边的木材运到大河边。会议要求各地林业局应加强企业管理，建立健全的规章制度。对于现有机械设备，应加强保养与修复，在生产过程中要注意安全，一切采伐的单位要作好更新工作。为适应森林工业的发展，会议要求各地积极准备开发新林区，大抓规划设计和基本建设工作，继续发展制材生产，发展人造板工业和林产化学工业。
    会议还对人民公社如何经营管理森林的有关问题，全国不同地区林业生产建设工作的不同重点，各地林业生产应有的比例等问题作了详细的讨论，并且提出了一些建议。（附图片）
