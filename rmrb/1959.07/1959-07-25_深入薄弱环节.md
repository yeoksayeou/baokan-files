Delving into weak links

Shu Jia

Whether or not victory can be achieved in production and work depends on many factors. Whether or not cadres can provide effective leadership and proper command is a very important one. The key issue here is whether the work style of the cadres is thorough enough.

Being thorough means truly going among the masses, going into production, understanding the situation while working and living alongside the masses, discovering problems, and working with the masses to jointly study and find solutions. This kind of in-depth understanding of the situation among the masses, and reliance on the masses to solve problems, can not only avoid and reduce the problems of bureaucracy and subjectivism, but also further inspire the enthusiasm of the masses for labor and strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses, and between the cadres and the masses. Cadres going deep down, leading by example, participating in production and leading production, acting as both commanders and fighters, can often greatly boost morale and inspire fighting spirit at decisive moments, thereby overcoming difficulties and achieving victory.

Cadres going deep among the masses and into production should first delve into the weak links in work and production. Weak links are those with the most problems and that need the most leadership; they are also often the key to determining the overall victory or defeat. Strengthening leadership over weak links and breaking through weak links can promote the overall improvement of work. Weak links may exist in every region, every period, and every task. Leaders must be good at identifying weak links and eliminating them in a timely manner to promote the overall situation. In the early rice harvest, cadres of the Nan Dazhai Commune in Yuanjiang County, Hunan Province, delved down and discovered the weak link of slow rice bundling progress and insufficiently meticulous harvesting. They promptly strengthened leadership, studied solutions, and demonstrated with their own actions, quickly increasing the efficiency of rice bundling by more than double, while also achieving meticulous harvesting. After the experience of Nan Dazhai Commune cadres delving into weak links was promoted, the rice bundling progress of various communes in Yuanjiang County greatly improved, and the harvesting was more meticulous than in previous years, with very little grain loss.

The experience of Yuanjiang County once again proves that cadres going deep into production and into weak links is indeed an important working method.

    深入薄弱环节
    蜀嘉
    搞生产，做工作，能不能取得胜利，是由许多因素决定的。干部能否做到领导有方、指挥得宜，就是很重要的一条。其中关键的问题在于干部工作作风是否深入。
    所谓深入，就是真正地到群众中去、到生产中去，在和群众同劳动同生活的过程中，了解情况，发现问题，并和群众一起共同研究、共同设法解决问题。这样深入群众了解情况，并且依靠群众解决问题，不但可以避免和减少官僚主义、主观主义的毛病；而且可以进一步鼓舞群众的劳动热情，加强党与群众、干部与群众的联系。干部深入下去，以身作则，参加生产领导生产，既是指挥员又是战斗员，往往能够在决定性的关头，大大提高士气、鼓舞斗志，从而战胜困难，取得胜利。
    干部深入群众、深入生产，首先应当深入到工作和生产的薄弱环节。薄弱环节，也就是问题最多、最需要领导的环节，也往往是决定全局胜负的关键。加强了对薄弱环节的领导，突破了薄弱环节，就能够推动全面搞好工作。薄弱环节在每个地区、每个时期、每项工作中都可能存在，领导者要善于发现薄弱环节，并且要及时消除薄弱环节，以推动全局。湖南沅江县南大膳公社在收割早稻中，干部深入下去，发现了扮禾进度太慢、收打得不细致这个薄弱环节，及时加强了领导，研究了解决的办法，并且以自己的实际行动作了示范，很快就使扮禾工效提高一倍以上，而且做到了细收细打。南大膳公社干部深入薄弱环节的经验推广以后，沅江县各公社的扮禾进度都大大提高，收打得也比往年细致，掉谷现象很少。
    沅江县的经验再一次证明：干部深入生产、深入薄弱环节，确是一个重要的工作方法。
