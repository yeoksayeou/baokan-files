    A Good Start for Researching Indigenous Pesticides
    Introducing "A Record of Chinese Indigenous Pesticides"
    Edited by the Editorial Committee of "A Record of Chinese Indigenous Pesticides," published by Science Press
     Cai Banghua
    "A Record of Chinese Indigenous Pesticides" was compiled collaboratively by ten units in Beijing during the Great Leap Forward in China in 1958. It is based on summarizing mass experiences and provides a scientific analysis and arrangement of indigenous pesticides. The book includes a total of 522 kinds of indigenous pesticides, including 220 kinds of plant-based indigenous pesticides, 19 kinds of mineral and animal-based indigenous pesticides, 183 kinds of other plant-based indigenous pesticides, and 100 kinds of mixed preparations. The book provides concise descriptions of the name, scientific name, alias, characteristics, distribution, composition, properties, preparation methods, efficacy tests, and control targets of various indigenous pesticides. At the end of the volume, there are also 106 pages of clear color illustrations, exquisitely depicting 220 kinds of plant-based indigenous pesticides, making it easy for the masses to quickly recognize indigenous pesticides, and the reference value is particularly prominent. Therefore, this book is a more comprehensive scientific and technological summary of the national large-scale indigenous pesticide campaign in 1958 and is a good reference book for production practice and scientific research. The ten participating units, namely the Production Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce, the Plant Protection Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture, the Technology Department of the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Institute of Entomology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Botany, the Institute of Microbiology, the Institute of Plant Protection of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the Institute of Materia Medica of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, the Institute of Epidemiology, and Beijing Agricultural University, completed this glorious task in a very short period, fully demonstrating the spirit of collective creation, which is admirable. Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, pointed out in the preface: "The large-scale indigenous pesticide movement not only solved the shortage of chemical pesticides and guaranteed agricultural production but also pointed out a new direction for the development of pesticide research in the future, with very broad prospects. Therefore, the indigenous pesticide movement has political, economic, and scientific and cultural significance." "A Record of Chinese Indigenous Pesticides" bears such a significant mission.
    As we all know, the history of indigenous pesticides in China is very early. Our ancestors, especially the working people of all dynasties in China, have accumulated rich and valuable experience. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, indigenous pesticides played a huge role in production practice. The main reasons can be summarized as: local sourcing, abundant sources, simple manufacturing, low cost, compound formulation, simultaneous treatment of diseases and insects, safety for humans and animals, and combination of fertilizer effects. Some indigenous pesticides, such as tobacco, not only have direct insecticidal ability (a 0.005% diluted water extract can paralyze rice stem borers, leading to death) but also have systemic functions, while stimulating plant growth and exerting comprehensive effects.
    According to the preliminary screening by various collaborating units, many of the more than 500 kinds of indigenous pesticides recorded in "A Record of Chinese Indigenous Pesticides" have extremely high efficacy. For example, the Institute of Entomology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences tested more than 400 kinds and found that the 20-fold water extract of 46 kinds achieved 100% mortality of mosquito larvae, such as *Stemona japonica*, soapberry, chili pepper, *Picrasma quassioides*, *Dioscorea nipponica*, wild carrot, croton, tea cake, derris, *Tripterygium wilfordii*, and pyrethrum. Among them, *Stemona japonica*, even diluted to a 2,000-fold water extract, can still cause all mosquito larvae to die; *Stemona japonica* root contains 0.03% alkaloids, and if refined and purified, a concentration of only 0.000015 can kill mosquito larvae, and its efficacy is not worse than 666. Other examples include pufferfish, *Pueraria montana*, *Rhododendron molle*, *Prinsepia uniflora*, and *Clematis chinensis* which have good toxicity against armyworms, while *Asarum sieboldii*, *Millettia dielsiana*, and *Hibiscus syriacus* have high toxicity against houseflies. The Institute of Microbiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences found more than 60 kinds of indigenous pesticides with good control effects on one or several diseases among the 321 kinds tested, such as *Lycoris radiata* and *Agrostemma githago* which have stable disease prevention effects on potato late blight and three rust diseases of wheat. The Institute of Botany of the Chinese Academy of Sciences identified more than 200 kinds of plant-based indigenous pesticides, determined their scientific names, initially unified the Chinese names, and clarified some chaotic phenomena of different names for the same thing or the same name for different things in various places. The Institute of Plant Protection of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences confirmed the control effects of nine kinds of indigenous pesticides on wheat leaf rust and six kinds of indigenous pesticides on stripe rust through experiments. The results of these tests greatly improved the scientific and economic value of indigenous pesticides.
    The editorial committee of this book said in the "Preface": Due to the tight schedule and the fact that the scientific research work on indigenous pesticides is just beginning, this book still has many shortcomings that need to be gradually corrected in the future. Judging from the current promotion of indigenous pesticides throughout the country and the content of "A Record of Chinese Indigenous Pesticides," further research and improvement of indigenous pesticides for controlling various diseases and insects are urgently needed by scientists in entomology, phytopathology, toxicology, medicinal chemistry, and chemical engineering. For example, although the book records two to three hundred kinds of plant-based indigenous pesticides, which kinds have outstanding efficacy, what are the conditions for their production and manufacturing, and even preliminary industrialization, all need to be further studied and resolved by scientists. The book only records nineteen kinds of mineral and animal-based indigenous pesticides, which is too concise and needs to be enriched. Since China has rich mineral resources, mineral-based indigenous pesticides have great potential for development. Animal-based indigenous pesticides also have great potential. For example, pufferfish are abundant in China's coastal waters and downstream rivers and have strong toxicity. It is known that its toxic effect on rice planthoppers, aphids, and other pests is better than that of foreign drugs. If further research and utilization can be carried out, it may shine in animal-based insecticides. Under the item of *Mylabris phalerata*, the book believes that the "chuji" (臭鸡) (stink chicken) or "hongniangzi" (红娘子) (red maiden) growing on *Ailanthus altissima* (Chinese Sumac) is a kind of *Mylabris phalerata*, which is a continuation of the mistake of the ancients and should be corrected. The *Ailanthus* bug is an insect of the family *Auchenorrhyncha*, which is not related to the *Mylabris phalerata* of the family Meloidae of the order Coleoptera; another kind of red cicada, also named "hongniangzi" (红娘子) (red maiden), also contains cantharidin, which has also been used as medicine since ancient times, but it belongs to the family Cicadidae of the order Hemiptera and is not the *Ailanthus* bug on the *Ailanthus altissima*. It may have insecticidal effects, but it cannot be confused with *Mylabris phalerata*. However, these are further research materials, and the value of this book is still significant. Moreover, it is precisely the publication of this book that has promoted the scientific community's attention to research on this type of issue, which will undoubtedly play a great positive role in the improvement of indigenous pesticides. Finally, the book introduces 100 kinds of mixed preparations, their formulas, and usage targets, although briefly in a table, it points out a new direction for pesticide research. Up to now, there have been frequent reports of examples of using mixed preparations to improve the insecticidal and disease-killing efficacy to a high degree. This is a more complex research problem that deserves the attention of scientists.
    In general, thanks to the Party's correct proposal of the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods and walking on two legs, the research and utilization of indigenous pesticides have been valued by all parties. Especially at present, when chemical pesticides are in great shortage, the varieties and formulas of indigenous pesticides with higher efficacy are often newly discovered through the vigorous creation and exploration of the masses, and the future is promising. In the future, under the guidance of breaking superstitions, researching, and implementing, we should further promote the collaboration of relevant scientists and carry out scientific research. Here, it is especially important to note that the experiments must be accurate, and the formulas, modulation, and establishment of factories must be based on implementation. Because the types of indigenous pesticides are vast, but there are quite a few varieties with poor effects or conflicts with traditional Chinese medicine, it is incorrect to think that they are readily available without scientific research, or to arbitrarily formulate them, only seeking novelty and disregarding actual effects. The compilation of "A Record of Chinese Indigenous Pesticides" has created a good start for the research of Chinese indigenous pesticides.

    研究土农药的良好开端
    介绍“中国土农药志”
    中国土农药志编辑委员会编著　科学出版社出版
     蔡邦华
    “中国土农药志”是1958年我国大跃进中，由北京的十个单位协作编写而成的。它以总结群众经验为基础，对土农药加以科学的分析和整理。全书包括土农药共五百二十二种，内分植物性土农药二百二十种，矿物和动物性土农药十九种，其他植物性土农药一百八十三种，另有混合制剂一百种。对于各种土农药的名称、学名、别名、特征、分布、成分、性能、配制方法、药效测定和防治对象，书中均有扼要记述。在卷末又有显明彩色图版一百零六面，精致地描绘出二百二十种植物性土农药，便于群众能迅速地认识土农药，参考价值尤为突出。因此，本书是1958年全国大搞土农药较为全面性的科学技术总结，是生产实践和科学研究方面的一本好的参考书。参加编写的十个单位，即商业部生产资料局、农业部植物保护局、化工部技术司、中国科学院昆虫研究所、植物研究所、微生物研究所、中国农业科学院植物保护研究所、中国医学科学院药物研究所、流行病研究所和北京农业大学，在极短的时间内，充分发挥集体创作精神，完成这项光荣任务，这是值得钦佩的。中国科学院郭沫若院长曾在序文中指出：“大搞土农药运动不仅解决了化学农药的不足，保证了农业生产，而且为今后农药研究的发展指出了新的方向，前途非常广大。因此土农药运动具有政治、经济和科学文化三方面的意义。”“中国土农药志”是负有这样重大使命的。
    众所周知，土农药在我国发展的历史很早。我们的祖先，尤其是我国历代劳动人民，积累了丰富和宝贵的经验。在1958年大跃进中，土农药对于生产实践更起了巨大的作用。其主要原因，可以归纳为：就地取材，来源丰富，制造简单，成本低廉，复方配合，病虫兼治，人畜安全，肥效结合。有的土农药如烟草，不但有直接杀虫能力（万分之五的稀释水浸液，就能麻醉蚁螟，以致死亡），更有内吸功能，兼而刺激植物生长，发挥综合效应。
    “中国土农药志”中所载的五百多种土农药，根据协作各单位的初步筛选证明，许多种类都有极高的功效。例如，中国科学院昆虫研究所，就从四百多种中测定出四十六种的二十倍水浸液，对于杀死孑孓能力，都达到百分之百效果，例如百部、皂荚、辣椒、苦木、穿山龙、野胡萝卜、巴豆、茶饼、鱼藤、雷公藤和除虫菊等。就中尤以百部虽稀释到二千倍的水浸液，也能使孑孓全部死亡；查百部根含生物碱万分之三，如加以精制提纯，只要千万分之一点五的浓度，就可以杀死孑孓，效力并不比六六六差。他如河豚（腊头鱼）、苦葛、闹羊花、苦子和透骨草等对粘虫的毒效较好，细辛、苦藤子和川槿皮等对家蝇的毒效较高。中国科学院微生物研究所，在测定三百二十一种土农药中，找到了六十余种对一种或几种病害有良好防治效果，如石蒜和鹤虱对马铃薯晚疫病和小麦三种锈病有稳定性防病效果。中国科学院植物研究所，鉴定了植物性土农药二百多种，定出学名，初步统一了中名，澄清了一些各地同物异名或异物同名的混乱现象。中国农业科学院植物保护研究所，通过试验肯定了九种土农药对小麦叶锈病的防治效果，六种土农药对条锈病的防治效果。这些测定工作的结果，大大提高了土农药的科学性和经济价值。
    本书编委会在“前言”中说：由于时间仓促，而且土农药的科学研究工作又方在开始，本书还存有不少缺点，有待于今后逐步订正。以目下全国土农药的推广情况以及“中国土农药志”的内容而论，对于土农药防治各种病虫的进一步研究和提高，确是急迫有待于昆虫学、植病学、毒理学、药物化学和化工各方面科学工作者继续努力的。例如，书中关于植物性土农药虽记载了二三百种，但效能突出的种类究有哪几种，它们的生产制造以至于初步工业化的条件又如何，就都非经科学工作者进一步研究解决不可。书中关于矿物性和动物性土农药只记述了十九种，嫌其简约，也有待充实。由于在我国有丰富的矿产，矿物性土农药是大有发展余地的。动物性土农药中，也还存有极大潜力。例如，腊头鱼在我国近海及江河下游，产量丰富，毒性猛烈，已知其对于稻飞虱、蚜虫类多种害虫的毒杀作用，胜过洋药，如能进一步研究利用，在动物性杀虫剂中可能放出异彩。书中斑蝥项下，认为生于樗树（臭椿）上的“樗鸡”一名“红娘子”作为斑蝥一种，这是延用古人之误，应予以纠正的。樗鸡为同翅目樗鸡科昆虫，与鞘翅目芫青科的斑蝥无关；另有一种红蝉，亦名“红娘子”，且含有斑蝥素，从古亦入药用，但属同翅目蝉科，并非樗树上的樗鸡，可能有杀虫作用，但不能与斑蝥混同。不过，这些都是进一步的研究资料，本书的价值仍是重大的。并且，正是本书的出版，才促进了科学界重视研究这一类问题，这对于土农药的提高，无疑地是起很大的积极作用的。最后，在书中介绍了一百种混合制剂及其配方和使用对象，虽简略成一表，但为研究农药指出了新的方向。到目前为止，由于利用混合制剂，提高到高度的杀虫杀病效力的例子常有所闻。这是一个比较复杂的研究问题，值得科学工作者重视。
    总的来说，由于党正确地提出了土洋并举和两条腿走路的方针，土农药的研究利用，已被各方所重视。尤其是目下化学农药的十分不足，土农药中效力较高的品种和配方，经过群众的大力创造和挖掘，常有新的发现，前途是大有可为的。今后，在破除迷信、研究落实的指导思想下，应进一步促成有关科学工作者的协作，展开科学研究。在这里，特别要注意的是，试验务求其正确，配方、调制和设厂必须在落实的基础上。因为土农药的种类浩如烟海，但效果较差或与中药有矛盾的品种为数颇多，所以不经科学研究就认为垂手可得，或任意配制，只求新异，不计实效，这些作法也是不正确的。“中国土农药志”的编写，为研究中国土农药的工作创立了良好的开端。
