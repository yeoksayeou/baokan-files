    Indigenous Pesticides for Preventing Cabbage Pests - Tree of Heaven and Castor Bean
    There are many types of pesticides for preventing diseases and insect pests in Chinese cabbage. Some chemical pesticides can prevent a variety of diseases and insect pests and are very effective. Some indigenous pesticides, such as the most widely distributed Tree of Heaven and castor bean, have good effects on preventing vegetable worms and are simple and safe to use. A summary is presented below:
    Tree of Heaven: Belongs to the Celastraceae family and is distributed throughout the Yangtze River and Yellow River basins in China.
    Tree of Heaven is a wild shrub, often growing in mountain forests, reaching a height of over six or seven meters, with leaves similar in shape to mulberry leaves, single leaves alternating. The bark, roots, and leaves of the Tree of Heaven contain toxins and have insecticidal effects.
    Grind the stems and root bark of the Tree of Heaven into powder, add two parts of wood ash or fine soil per part, and sprinkle the powder to control flea beetles, with a 70%-85% insecticidal effect. One catty of Tree of Heaven bark and 0.6 catty of soap, add 30 catties of water, soak for 24 hours, stir well to remove residue, and spray to control flea beetles with a 70%-85% effect.
    Dry the root bark and leaves of the Tree of Heaven in the sun, stir-fry over fire until a pungent odor is emitted, then remove, crush, and sprinkle the powder in the morning to prevent insect pests. It is 83% effective against flea beetles and 100% effective against red spiders and cabbage caterpillars.
    Castor Bean: Belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is cultivated throughout the north and south of China, commonly known as "big hemp seed."
    Dry and grind castor bean leaves and stalks into powder, and sprinkle six catties per mu to control grubs. Mix the powder with manure and apply it with sowing, six to eight catties per mu, to control grubs, with an insecticidal rate of over 90%.
    The residue after pressing castor beans for oil can kill various wasps. One catty of oil residue, five catties of water, and 0.13 catty of soap can be made into an emulsion to prevent aphids, vegetable worms, etc.
    One catty of castor bean leaves plus ten catties of water, the boiled stock solution can kill vegetable worms, cabbage webworms, etc.

    防治白菜害虫的土农药——苦树和蓖麻
    防治大白菜病虫害的农药种类很多，有些化学农药能防治多种病虫害，而且效力很高。有些土农药，像分布最广的苦树、蓖麻等，对防治菜虫都有较好的效果，使用也简便安全。现摘要介绍如下：
    苦树　属卫矛科，我国长江流域、黄河流域各地都有分布。
    苦树是野生灌木，多生于山坡丛林中，高过六、七公尺，叶子形似桑叶，单叶互生。苦树的皮、草根、叶子含有毒素，有杀虫作用。
    苦树茎及根皮磨粉，每份加草木灰或细土两份，撒粉防治猿叶虫，杀虫效果70％—85％。苦树皮一斤、肥皂零点六斤，加清水三十斤，浸泡二十四小时，搅匀去渣，喷洒防治猿叶虫效果70％—85％。
    苦树根皮和树叶晒干，用火炒至有刺激味时取出捣碎，早晨撒粉防治虫害，对猿叶虫效果83％，对红蜘蛛、菜青虫100％。
    蓖麻　属大?科，我国南北各地都有栽培，俗名大麻子。
    蓖麻叶、秸秆晒干磨粉，每亩撒六斤，可防治蛴螬。药粉拌入粪里，随播种施下，每亩六到八斤，可防治蛴螬，杀虫率90％以上。
    蓖麻子榨油后的残渣能杀死各种蜂类，油渣一斤水五斤肥皂零点一三斤，制成乳剂能防治蚜虫、菜虫等。
    蓖麻叶一斤加水十斤，煮沸的原液，可杀死菜虫、苞心虫等。
