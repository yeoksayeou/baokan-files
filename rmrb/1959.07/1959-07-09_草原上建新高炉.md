Building a New Blast Furnace on the Grassland

The newly built No. 2 55-cubic-meter blast furnace at the Ulanhot Iron and Steel Plant in Inner Mongolia has recently been put into production.

A month before this blast furnace was put into production, the workers of the Ulanhot Iron and Steel Plant started building kilns for coking and successfully trial-produced a wooden coal washing machine, which increased work efficiency by 35% compared with manual labor. It can save 525 labor units every day.

    草原上建新高炉
    内蒙古乌兰浩特钢铁厂新建的二号五十五立方米高炉已在最近投入生产。
    乌兰浩特钢铁厂职工在这座高炉投入生产以前一个月，就着手建窑炼焦，并且试制成功了一台木制洗煤机，比人工提高工作效率35％。每天可以节约五百二十五个劳动力。
