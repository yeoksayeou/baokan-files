What is "Black Frost"?
　　There is a distinction between "white frost" and "black frost". When the temperature drops to several degrees below zero, but because the air is dry and there is little water vapor, although "white frost" is not visible on the ground, crops are damaged by the cold, and often wither and turn black due to the cold and die. This is the so-called "black frost." In reality, this is not "frost" at all, but frost damage.

    什么叫“黑霜”？
    霜有“白霜”、“黑霜”的分别。温度下降到零下几度，但因空气干燥，水汽少，这时在地面上虽然看不到“白霜”，可是庄稼却被冻坏了，而且往往因为受冻而枯萎发黑而死。这就是所谓的“黑霜”。实际上，这并不是什么“霜”，而是冻害。
