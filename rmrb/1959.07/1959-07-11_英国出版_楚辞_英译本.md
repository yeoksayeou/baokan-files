    British Publication of English Translation of "Chu Ci"

    According to a report in the Times Literary Supplement of the United Kingdom, the classic Chinese masterpiece "Chu Ci" has been published by Oxford University Press, translated by Dr. Hawkes, professor of Chinese at Oxford University. It is said that this is the first complete English translation of "Chu Ci." Its first chapter, "Li Sao," with its southern sentiment and mode of expression, is fresh to Western readers, because so far, most of the Chinese literature translated into foreign languages has been the doctrines of Confucius. The newspaper said that Hawkes' English translation is well organized, with introductions to each poem or group of poems, annotations on metaphors and typical characters, and special annotations for scholars.

    英国出版“楚辞”英译本
    据英国泰晤士报文学增刊报道，我国古典名著“楚辞”，已由牛津大学出版社出版，译者是牛津大学中文教授霍克斯博士。据说这是第一本完整的“楚辞”英译本，它的第一篇“离骚”所具有的南方情调和表达方式对西方读者是新鲜的，因为到目前为止，译成外文的中国文学大部分是孔子学说。这家报纸说，霍克斯的英译本组织得很好，每篇或每组诗前都有介绍，对引喻和典型人物都有注解，并附有为学者加的专门注解。
