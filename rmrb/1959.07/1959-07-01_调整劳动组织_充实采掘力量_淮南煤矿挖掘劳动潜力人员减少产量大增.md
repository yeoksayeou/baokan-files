Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 30th: Huainan Coal Mine has rationally adjusted its labor organization, greatly tapping the internal labor potential of the enterprise. As of now, the mine has adjusted out 9,818 people through the reorganization of labor; among them, 4,162 people have been added to coal mining and tunneling, 485 people have been transferred for training and to technical schools, 906 people have been transferred to temporary waterproofing and drainage projects, 537 people are engaged in sideline production, and 3,728 people have been transferred to support agricultural production.

After the adjustment, the labor organization is much more reasonable than before. For example, the ratio of mining and tunneling workers to auxiliary workers has changed from 4.5:5.5 to 5.3:4.7; the proportion of coal management cadres to coal production personnel has also dropped from 8.5% to 6.3%. The increase in direct production workers and the decrease in auxiliary production workers have correspondingly improved production efficiency. The mine's full-member efficiency in February was 1.4 tons, which increased to 1.818 tons in April. The wage cost per ton of coal produced dropped from 1.81 yuan in February to 1.37 yuan in May. The average efficiency from January to May this year increased by 6.4% compared to last year. Moreover, coal production has been increasing month by month. The actual output from January to May this year increased by more than 76% compared to the same period last year.

In the process of reorganizing the labor organization, the mine first merged some overlapping institutions with similar businesses and changed the phenomenon of over-detailed division of labor and repetitive work. For example, the transportation area of ​​Jiulonggang Mine merged 22 single-job groups into 11 comprehensive groups, reducing more than 70 people than before. Secondly, the promotion of multi-skilled and part-time operations was implemented. Some mines combined electricians and fitters into one, some mines combined lathe operators and fitters into one, some combined ironworkers, riveters, and welders into one, and some drivers have been able to operate and repair.

Huainan Coal Mine also closely integrates technical innovation, mobilizes the masses of employees to improve production technology, and ensures the continuous improvement of labor productivity. Since the beginning of this year, they have vigorously promoted coal mining methods such as hydraulic coal mining, shield supports, and regular multi-cycle operations, which have continuously improved the efficiency of retreat mining workers. The efficiency of retreat mining workers in May was 25% higher than in February.

Recently, the Ministry of Coal Industry held an on-site conference on the reorganization of labor organizations in coal mines nationwide in Huainan, summarizing and exchanging the experience of Huainan Coal Mine in rationally adjusting labor organizations.

### 调整劳动组织　充实采掘力量  淮南煤矿挖掘劳动潜力人员减少产量大增

    调整劳动组织　充实采掘力量
    淮南煤矿挖掘劳动潜力人员减少产量大增
    据新华社合肥30日电　淮南煤矿合理地调整劳动组织，大大挖掘了企业内部的劳动潜力。到目前为止，这个矿已通过整顿劳动组织调整出了九千八百一十八人；其中，充实到采煤和掘进方面的有四千一百六十二人，调出培训和到技工学校学习的四百八十五人，调做防水和排水临时性工程的九百零六人，搞副业生产的五百三十七人，外调支援农业生产的三千七百二十八人。
    经过调整以后，劳动组织比过去合理多了。如采掘工人与辅助工人的比例，由原来四·五比五·五改变为五·三比四·七；原煤管理干部占原煤生产人员的比例，也由原来的8.5％下降到6.3％。直接生产工人的增加和辅助生产工人的减少，就相应地提高了生产效率。这个矿2月份全员效率是一点四吨，到4月份就提高到一点八一八吨。每生产一吨煤的工资成本，由2月份的一点八一元下降到5月份的一点三七元。今年1月到5月份的平均效率，比去年提高了6.4％。而且煤炭产量逐月上升，今年1月到5月份的实际产量，比去年同期增长了76％以上。
    这个矿在整顿劳动组织过程中首先合并了一些业务相似的重叠机构，改变了分工过细和工作重复的现象。如九龙岗矿运输区将二十二个单一的工种小组合并为十一个综合小组，比原来减少了七十多人。其次，推行了多面手和兼职作业。有些矿把电工、钳工合而为一，有些矿把车工、钳工合而为一，有的把铁、铆、焊合而为一，有的司机已经做到能操作会修理。
    淮南煤矿还紧密地结合技术革新，发动职工群众改进生产技术，保证劳动生产率的不断提高。今年以来，他们大力推广水力采煤、掩护支架和正规多循环作业等采煤法，使回采工的效率不断提高，5月份回采工的效率就比2月份提高了25％。
    最近，煤炭工业部在淮南召开了全国煤矿整顿劳动组织工作现场会议，总结交流了淮南煤矿合理调整劳动组织的经验。
