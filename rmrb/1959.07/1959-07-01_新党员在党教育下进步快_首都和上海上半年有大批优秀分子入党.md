Xinhua News Agency, 30th: New Party members who joined the Party during the Great Leap Forward last year are progressing rapidly under the constant education of Party organizations at all levels of the Chinese Communist Party and have become a new backbone force in uniting the masses to complete various construction tasks.

In 1958, Party organizations developed on all fronts. Most of the new Party members came from the industrial and agricultural fronts. The proportion of new Party members recruited in people's communes was the largest. Many production teams that previously had no Party members have now established grassroots Party organizations. Among the new Party members recruited last year were also many outstanding engineering and technical personnel, senior intellectuals, primary and secondary school teachers, and other intellectuals. In minority nationality areas, Party organizations have also generally developed.

Under the constant education of Party organizations in various regions, these new Party members have generally made great progress and played a backbone role on all fronts. Liu Xiuren, an old worker in the processing section of the seamless steel tube plant in Anshan, and Liu Zhenyun and Hao Zhanzhong, young energy conservation experts, set an example among the masses after joining the Party, repeatedly creating high-yield records and proactively cooperating with other sections, thus winning the plant's Red Flag of Excellence. Zhang Shenxiu and Chang Jize, new Party members of the Northwest Machine Manufacturing Plant in Xi'an, united fifteen workers in the "Red Flag Bearer" movement and formed a production shock team, which overfulfilled its production plan every month from October last year to April this year. Ouyang Juying, a new Party member of the Wangchenggang People's Commune in Xinjian County, Jiangxi Province, organized a women's dike repair shock platoon. She took the lead in working hard and skillfully, enabling the entire platoon to create a record of averaging thirty-two cubic meters of earth moved per person per day, earning her the title of "Mu Guiying Platoon" by the commune members. Zhao Pilie, director of the Otolaryngology Department of the Shenyang Central Hospital of the Shenyang Railway Administration, actively united and led all members of the department to carry out technological innovations after joining the Party. He and Doctor Fan Renyu created a method for treating retinitis and choroiditis, with very good medical results. Thanks to his leading efforts, the Otolaryngology Department has now been rated as the most advanced red flag department in the entire hospital.

Xinhua News Agency, 30th: In the first half of this year, 10,953 outstanding individuals from central government agencies and Beijing Municipality joined the Communist Party.

Among the new Party members in central government agencies, many are engineering and technical personnel. For example, among the forty-one new Party members in the Ministry of Construction Engineering, seventeen are engineering and technical personnel, and among the thirty-three new Party members in the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, sixteen are engineering and technical personnel.

Among the new Party members are also some scientists, professors, and actors. These include Xia Nai, director of the Institute of Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences, Tao Hong, associate researcher of the Institute of Chemistry, and the famous Peking Opera actor Mei Lanfang. Among the new Party members in central government agencies are also model figures in various fields who work diligently within the agencies, such as custodians, librarians, dispatchers, nursery workers, and receptionists.

Many of the new Party members in Beijing Municipality are advanced individuals in production and work. For example, among the 542 new Party members developed by the Jingxi Mining Bureau, 302 are advanced producers. The new Party members in Beijing Municipality have played a backbone role in socialist construction. Lin Zhinan, a plumber and new Party member at the Diaoyutai construction site of the Tenth Construction Company, has not been absent from work for seven years, actively engages in production, and has created four new tools such as a drilling machine, greatly improving work efficiency. Liu Tianjun, a sales clerk at the Shang'an Township retail store in Mentougou District, works actively, provides good service, and has excellently completed his tasks, and was selected as a representative to attend the National Congress of Activists in Socialist Construction for Youth.

Young Party members account for a large proportion of the new Party members in central government agencies and Beijing Municipality.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 30th: From January to May this year, Party organizations at all levels in Shanghai admitted eight thousand outstanding individuals with communist consciousness into the Party.

Among these newly admitted probationary Party members are workers, farmers, government employees, scientists, professors, and actors. They have all been tested by the rectification campaign and the Great Leap Forward movement and are advanced figures in production and work.

More than one hundred of these new Party members are senior intellectuals. Among them are Su Buqing, vice president of Fudan University and a famous mathematician; Cui Zhixi, president of Zhongshan Hospital; Zhang Zonghan, deputy director of the Biology Department of East China Normal University; Tian Pei, chief engineer of the Road Design Office of the Municipal Engineering Design Institute; writer Zhang Jin'yi; film director Shen Fu; famous Peking Opera actor Zhou Xinfang; Kunqu Opera actor Yu Zhenfei; and film actor Qin Yi.

    据新华社30日讯　各地在去年大跃进中入党的新党员，在中国共产党各级组织的经常教育下进步很快，已成为团结群众完成各项建设任务中的一支新的骨干力量。
    1958年，党的组织在各个战线上都有了发展，其中大部分新党员来自工业和农业战线。在人民公社中接收的新党员占的比重最大，许多过去没有党员的生产队，现在都建立了党的基层组织。去年接收的新党员中还有很多优秀的工程技术人员、高级知识分子和中、小学教员等其他知识分子。在少数民族地区，党的组织也普遍有了发展。
    这些新党员在各地党组织的经常教育下，一般都有了很大进步，在各个战线上发挥了骨干作用。鞍钢无缝钢管厂加工工段老工人刘秀仁和青年节约能手刘珍运、郝占忠入党以后，在群众中处处起模范作用，并先后创造了二十多次高产纪录，主动和别的工段协作，因而获得了全厂优胜红旗。西安西北机器制造厂新党员张慎修、常洁泽，在“红旗手”运动中团结了十五个工人，组成了一个生产突击队，从去年10月到今年4月，月月都超额完成生产计划。江西省新建县望城岗人民公社新党员欧阳菊英，组织了一个妇女修堤突击排，她带头苦干巧干，使全排创造了平均每天每人挑土三十二方的纪录，被社员们誉为“穆桂英排”。沈阳铁路管理局沈阳中心医院五官科主任赵丕烈入党以后，积极团结和带领全科室人员大搞技术革新，他和大夫范人渔创造了一种治疗眼睛网膜脉络膜炎的方法，医疗效果很好。由于他的带头努力，五官科现在已被评为全院最先进的红旗科室。
    据新华社30日讯　中央国家机关和北京市今年上半年有一万零九百五十三名优秀分子加入共产党。

    在中央国家机关和北京市的新党员中，青年党员占很大的比重。
