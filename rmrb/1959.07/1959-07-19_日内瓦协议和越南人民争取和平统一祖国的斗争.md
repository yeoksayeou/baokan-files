    The Geneva Accords and the Vietnamese People's Struggle for Peaceful Reunification of the Motherland
    By Lin He, Vietnam

    Striving to Consolidate Peace and Reunify the Motherland
    Five years ago, following the historic victory of the Dien Bien Phu campaign, the Geneva Conference reached an agreement on restoring peace in Indochina. The Geneva Conference ended the Indochina War based on respect for the independence, sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.

    After the signing of the Geneva Accords, Vietnam faced another objective reality: the temporary division of Vietnam into two regions with different systems. North Vietnam had been completely liberated, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was healing the wounds of war and moving towards the broad road of socialism. South Vietnam, however, fell into the hands of a pro-American regime and became a new type of colony of US imperialism.

    The Vietnamese people yearned for the reunification of their motherland but deeply understood that this was a persistent and arduous revolutionary struggle. They also recognized that the struggle for reunification must be combined with the struggle for peace, independence, and democracy. The Geneva Accords are an important legal basis for this revolutionary struggle.

    Starting from the desire of the entire nation to unify the motherland, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently adhered to its peaceful policy and has repeatedly demonstrated its correct stance: strictly abiding by and implementing the Geneva Accords, and demanding that the South Vietnamese authorities adopt the same attitude. The facts of the past five years have proven this.

    The Democratic Republic of Vietnam has significantly reduced its military forces and defense budget, concentrating all its efforts on peaceful construction. From 1956 to 1957, 80,000 troops were reduced, and in 1958, further demobilization took place, with some troops transferred to the production and construction front. In 1956, the defense budget accounted for 22% of the total budget, but by 1959, it only accounted for 17.3%. Hundreds of factories were restored and newly built, and the famine left over from the French imperialist rule was fundamentally eliminated. Illiteracy was eradicated among more than ten million people in North Vietnam, and the people's lives were continuously improving.

    In order to consolidate peace and prevent the recurrence of war, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently and unremittingly fulfilled the terms of the Geneva Accords and fully guaranteed the democratic freedoms of those who had cooperated with the other side in the past.

    The Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently maintained a solemn and positive attitude in implementing the political provisions of the Geneva Accords and striving for the reunification of the motherland. After the withdrawal of French troops from Vietnamese territory, Premier Pham Van Dong announced his readiness to consult with representative and responsible authorities in South Vietnam on holding free general elections nationwide and unifying the motherland. Subsequently, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam wrote several letters to the South Vietnamese authorities, requesting consultations on issues such as reducing armaments, conducting trade between the two sides, and restoring normal relations between the North and South regions, based on mutual respect, mutual understanding, and humility, and put forward many practical and feasible specific proposals. However, the South Vietnamese authorities stubbornly refused to negotiate, deliberately abandoned the Geneva Accords, and brazenly took various illegal steps, attempting to turn South Vietnam into a military base for US arms expansion and war preparations, thereby making the situation in Indochina increasingly worse. The US-Ngo reactionary clique should bear all these consequences.

    The United States Transforms South Vietnam into a Military Base for Preparing New Wars
    In order to re-ignite a new war and seize world hegemony, the US imperialists have more than once revealed their arrogant attempt to occupy Indochina and make it a mainland military base surrounding new China.

    The facts cannot be denied. The number of American military advisors in South Vietnam has increased from 200 when peace was first restored to more than 2,000 at present. These advisors are truly ubiquitous, intervening directly in the General Staff, military regions, divisions, and even companies of the South Vietnamese army. These so-called "advisors" are specialized in expanding the South Vietnamese armed forces and establishing military bases and strategic highways in South Vietnam. The "US Military Assistance Advisory Group" has become the highest military command organization in South Vietnam, which is a well-known fact.

    When peace was first restored, the South Vietnamese army had battalions as the highest organizational unit. Now, South Vietnam has a regular army of 150,000 men, and divisions and corps have been established, and even a navy and air force have been created. If the reserves, local troops, and various armed forces are put together, South Vietnam has an army of 470,000 men.

    As for military airports, South Vietnam only had six large and medium-sized airports when the war ended. Today, the number of military airports in South Vietnam has increased to twenty-one, five of which can be used by jet aircraft. The Tan Son Nhut and Buon Ma Thuot airports are being expanded on a large scale. They will become the main air force bases in South Vietnam. The Saigon-Bien Hoa highway, this so-called "motor road" that is thirty-two kilometers long, with an airport runway and open space on both sides reaching two kilometers in width, is essentially a disguised military airport specifically for heavy jet aircraft.

    When the war ended, South Vietnam had almost no naval bases except for the Nha Trang naval port. However, now not only has the Nha Trang naval port strengthened various facilities, but other naval ports such as Da Nang, Nha Trang, and Qui Nhon have been dredged and strengthened with military facilities.

    The United States completely violated the guarantees it made at the Geneva Conference, and constantly illegally transported war materials and various new weapons into South Vietnam, including various types of machine guns, artillery, tanks, armored vehicles, warships, and military aircraft. Up to now, the US has illegally shipped hundreds of thousands of tons of military supplies into South Vietnam. Recently, the United States further concluded a so-called "Agreement for Cooperation Concerning Civil Uses of Atomic Energy" with the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities, plotting to transport atomic weapons into South Vietnam in a "legal" manner.

    It can be asserted that the US imperialists and their running dogs have shamelessly used the past five years of peaceful environment to step up preparations for war. Therefore, the situation in South Vietnam presents several prominent characteristics:

    First, while tightly binding South Vietnam to the chariot of arms expansion and war preparations, the US imperialists are painstakingly trying to drag South Vietnam into the Southeast Asia military aggression bloc. A little over a month after the signing of the Geneva Accords, the US imperialists colluded with some vassal states to form this aggressive military bloc, and even placed South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos under their "protection."

    Although the US imperialists cannot immediately make South Vietnam a "formal member" of this military group as they please, the ambiguous relationship between this military group and South Vietnam is deepening. The South Vietnamese authorities have participated in the various military exercises and military conferences of this aggressive group as an "observer." Recently, the US imperialists have been promoting South Vietnam's membership in the Southeast Asia military aggression group by signing bilateral agreements.

    Second, the expansion of the army and the establishment of military bases and strategic highways in South Vietnam are convenient for US imperialism to use the Southeast Asia aggression group to serve its own aggression plans. We only need to observe the military projects being expanded in South Vietnam to expose the ambitions of US imperialism. Today, some of the highways being expanded in South Vietnam have been connected to the Central Highlands strategic area, Lower Laos (southern Laos), and the US military bases in Thailand. To facilitate the activities of the US Air Force in the Philippines, South Vietnam, and Thailand, a system of airports for US military aircraft has been established in many areas of South Vietnam. As for setting up supply stations for weapons, ammunition, and war materials, the United States has built two military warehouses in the Central Highlands for supplying Thailand and Laos. Not long ago, the pro-American Lao Phoui Sananikone government sent a military delegation to Da Nang to discuss how to transfer US "aid" military supplies to Laos through the military port of South Vietnam. Immediately afterwards, the United States sent many ships to transfer war materials to Laos through Da Nang.

    From the above facts, South Vietnam has become a bridgehead for US imperialism to invade Indochina and Southeast Asia.

    Oppose US Interventionists and Their Running Dogs
    The US-Ngo clique knows that the crimes of dividing Vietnam and destroying peace will inevitably be met with strong resistance from the heroic Vietnamese people. The people of South Vietnam have always yearned for peace, national reunification, and democracy. Ngo Dinh Diem's group, a faithful lackey of US imperialism, is at a loss except to use force to persecute the people of South Vietnam.

    Under the guise of "anti-communism," the South Vietnamese authorities, obeying the orders of their American masters, have escalated from sporadic persecution to collective massacres. According to preliminary statistics, more than 180,000 people have been arrested and imprisoned, nearly 5,000 have been killed, and more than 10,000 have been injured. In various prisons and concentration camps, millions of South Vietnamese patriots have suffered extremely barbaric torture. The massacres in Xiangtian, Weichuan, Meiqi, Pingcheng, Yongchun, Henan, Zuoyao and other regions, especially the fascist suppression and persecution since 1958, have become even more intensified. For example, the shocking massacre of poisoning more than 1,000 political prisoners in the Phu Loi concentration camp at the end of last year; the atrocities of 15,000 South Vietnamese regular troops equipped with artillery and air force cover carrying out massacres against unarmed people in the Bien Hoa area; the promulgation of the so-called Law No. 10 of 1959, establishing special military courts, in an attempt to further persecute and kill South Vietnamese patriots, etc. These bloody debts created by the US-Ngo clique have been deeply imprinted in the hearts of the South Vietnamese people.

    Under the increasingly brutal and rampant suppression and persecution of the US-Ngo clique, the people of South Vietnam have suffered irreparable losses in their lives and property. However, the people of South Vietnam will not only not bow to the fascist demons, but the prisons, concentration camps, and medieval barbaric tortures of the US-Ngo clique, and even death, cannot deter their steps in the struggle for justice.

    The people of South Vietnam deserve the honorable title of "Bronze Wall of the Motherland." They were able to defeat the French colonialists in the eight or nine years of anti-aggression war, and today, in the just struggle against the US-Ngo clique, they will surely win victory.

    Today, the revolutionary tasks facing the Vietnamese people are still arduous. However, in an era when the East wind prevails over the West wind, with the strong support of the people of Asia and Africa, the socialist camp, and the world's forces for peace and democracy, the Vietnamese people are deeply convinced that their just struggle will win final victory, and a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam will be established.

    日内瓦协议和越南人民争取和平统一祖国的斗争
    越南　林禾
    争取巩固和平和统一祖国
    五年前，继奠边府战役历史性的胜利之后，日内瓦会议就恢复印度支那和平问题达成了协议。日内瓦会议在尊重越南、柬埔寨和老挝三国的独立主权、统一和领土完整的基础上结束了印度支那战争。
    日内瓦协议签订后，越南面临着另一个客观现实，即越南暂时分成两个制度不同的地区。越南北方已经完全解放，越南民主共和国医治好了战争的创伤，目前正朝着社会主义康庄大道前进。而南越却落在亲美政权的手里，变成了美帝国主义的新型殖民地。
    越南人民渴望着祖国统一，但深深地了解到这是一种持久而艰巨的革命斗争，并且认识到争取统一必须同争取和平、独立、民主相结合。日内瓦协议就是这个革命斗争的重要的法律依据。
    越南民主共和国从全国人民统一祖国的愿望出发，自始至终忠于自己的和平政策，并且屡次表明了自己的正确立场：严格遵守和执行日内瓦协议，并要求南越当局也采取同样态度。五年来的事实已经证明了这一点。
    越南民主共和国曾经大量裁减军队和国防预算，集中一切力量从事和平建设事业。自1956年至1957年已经裁减了八万名军队，1958年再度裁军并调动了一部分部队到生产建设战线上去。1956年国防预算占总预算的22％，到1959年只占17.3％。恢复和新建了几百个工厂，法帝国主义统治时期遗留下来的饥荒根本上已经解除了。越南北方扫除了一千多万人的文盲，人民的生活不断地得到了改善。
    越南民主共和国为了巩固和平，防止战火重燃，一贯不懈地履行日内瓦协议条款，并充分保证了过去与对方合作的人员的民主自由。
    越南民主共和国在执行日内瓦协议的政治条款和争取统一祖国的时候，始终保持了严正的和积极的态度。法国军队撤出越南领土之后，范文同总理曾宣布准备和南越有代表性的负责当局就举行全国自由普选和统一祖国进行协商。接着，越南民主共和国曾几次写信给南越当局，要求在互相尊重、互相了解和谦让的基础上就裁减军备、双方进行贸易、恢复南北地区之间的正常关系等等问题进行协商，并提出许多切实可行的具体建议。但南越当局一直顽固地拒绝协商，蓄意毁弃日内瓦协议，并悍然采取了种种违法步骤，企图把南越变为美国扩军备战的军事基地，从而使印度支那的局势日趋恶化。美吴反动集团应该全部承担这些后果。
    美国把南越变为准备新战争的军事基地
    为重新挑起一次新的战争和夺取世界霸权，美帝国主义者不止一次地暴露出它要霸占印度支那，使它成为一个包围新中国的大陆军事基地的狂妄企图。
    事实不容狡辩。在南越的美国军事顾问从和平刚恢复时的二百人已增加到目前的二千多人。这些顾问真是无孔不入，上自南越军队的总参谋部、各军区、各师团，下至各个连队，他们都直接插手其间。这些所谓“顾问”是专门搞南越武装力量的扩展工作，和在南越建立军事基地以及战略公路的。而“美国军事援助顾问团”成为南越最高的军事指挥机构，已是众所周知的事实了。
    和平刚恢复时，南越军队以营为最高编制单位。现在，南越却拥有一支十五万人的正规部队，并成立了师团和军团，甚至还建立了海军和空军。如果把后备队和地方部队以及各种武装力量拼凑起来，南越已有了一支四十七万人的军队。
    至于军用机场，南越在战争刚结束时只有六个大型和中型的机场。今天，南越的军用机场已增至二十一个，其中有五个可供喷气机使用。新山一和邦美蜀两个机场正在作大规模扩展。它将成为南越主要的空军基地。西贡—边和公路，这条长达三十二公里、机场跑道和两旁空地宽达二公里的所谓“汽车路”，实质上是一条专供重型喷气机使用的伪装的军事机场。
    战争刚结束时，除了芽?军港之外，南越几乎没有什么海军基地。可是，现在芽?军港不但加强了种种设备，其他军港像岘港、芽庄、归仁等都经过疏浚，并加强了军事设备。
    美国完全破坏了自己在日内瓦会议时所作的保证，把战争物资和各种新式武器不断违法地运入南越，其中包括各种类型的机关枪、大炮、坦克、装甲车、战舰和军用飞机。截至目前为止，美国非法运进南越的军用物资已达几十万吨。最近美国还进一步和吴庭艳当局缔结了一项所谓“和平使用原子能合作协定”，阴谋用“合法”方式把原子武器运进南越。
    可以断言，美帝国主义和他的走狗无耻地利用五年来的和平环境加紧准备战争。因此，使南越的局势呈现出几个显著的特点：
    一、美帝国主义一面把南越紧紧地缚在扩军备战的战车上，另一方面，处心积虑地要把南越拖进东南亚军事侵略集团。日内瓦协议签订后为时不过一个多月，美帝国主义即拉拢一些仆从国家成立了这个侵略性的军事集团，竟把南越、柬埔寨和老挝都置于它们的“保护”之下。
    虽然美帝国主义还不能随心所欲地立即使南越成为这个军事集团的“正式成员”，可是这个军事集团同南越的暖昧关系正在日益加深。南越当局曾以“观察员”资格参加了这个侵略集团历次的军事演习和军事会议。最近，美帝国主义以签订双边协定的方式来促使南越加入东南亚军事侵略集团。
    二、在南越加紧扩充军队，建立军事基地、战略公路，便于美帝国主义假手东南亚侵略集团为自己的侵略计划服务。我们只需略为观察一下南越正在扩建的军事工程，就不难揭穿美帝国主义的野心。今天正在南越扩建的公路，其中有的已和西原战略地区、下挝（老挝南部）以及美国在泰国的军事基地衔接起来了。为便利美国空军在菲律宾、南越和泰国进行活动，南越不少地区已系统地建立了可供美国军用飞机使用的机场。至于设置武器、弹药、战争物资的供应站，美国已在西原地区建设了两个供应泰国和老挝使用的军火仓库。不久以前，亲美的老挝培·萨纳尼空政府曾派出一个军事代表团到岘港，商讨如何通过南越这个军事港口把美“援”军用物资转运到老挝去的问题。紧接着美国开来了不少轮船，通过岘港把战争物资转运到老挝去。
    从上述种种事实看来，南越已变成美帝国主义侵略印度支那和东南亚的一个桥头堡。
    反对美国干涉者及其走狗
    美吴集团知道分裂越南、破坏和平的罪行一定会遭到英勇的越南人民的强烈反抗。南越人民一贯渴望和平、祖国统一和民主。美帝国主义忠实的走狗吴庭艳集团除了用武力迫害南越人民之外，即一筹莫展。
    在“反共”的幌子下，南越当局奉行美国主子命令，由零星的迫害发展到集体屠杀。根据初步统计，先后约有十八万多人被捕下狱，近五千人被杀害，一万多人受伤。在各个牢狱和集中营里，千千万万的南越爱国者遭受极其野蛮的毒刑折磨。美吴集团在向田、维川、楳棋、平城、永春、河南、佐药等地区的大屠杀，尤其是从1958年以来，法西斯式的镇压和迫害手段更是变本加厉。例如，去年年底在富利集中营毒杀一千多名政治犯的骇人听闻惨案；以一万五千名配备有炮兵和空军为掩护的南越正规军向边和地区手无寸铁的人民进行大屠杀的暴行；颁布所谓1959年第十号法令，设立特别军事法庭，企图进一步迫害和残杀南越爱国者等等。美吴集团造成的这些血海深仇，已深印在南越人民的心里。
    南越人民在美吴集团日益残暴猖狂的镇压和迫害下，生命财产蒙受了不可弥补的损失。但是，南越人民不仅不会向法西斯恶魔低头，美吴集团的牢狱、集中营和中世纪式的野蛮酷刑，甚至死亡也吓不退他们为正义而斗争的步伐。
    南越人民不愧为“祖国的铜墙”这一荣誉的称号。在八、九年的反侵略战争中既能击败法国殖民主义者，而今天，在反对美吴集团的正义斗争中也一定会赢得胜利。
    今天，摆在越南人民面前的革命任务还是很繁重的。但是，在东风压倒西风的时代里，在亚非各族人民、社会主义阵营、世界和平民主力量的大力支持下，越南人民深信他们的正义斗争一定会赢得最后胜利，一个和平、统一、独立、民主和富强的越南一定会建立起来。
