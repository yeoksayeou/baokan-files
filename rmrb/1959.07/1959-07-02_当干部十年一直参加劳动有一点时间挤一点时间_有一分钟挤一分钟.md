    Serving as a Cadre for Ten Years While Always Participating in Labor - Squeezing in Time Whenever Possible, Squeezing in a Minute Whenever Possible
    Qiu Shilong, Secretary of the Sixth Brigade Branch of Banpu People's Commune
    Comrade Qiu Shilong is a member of the Banpu People's Commune Party Committee in Guanyun County, Jiangsu Province, and concurrently the secretary of the Sixth Brigade Branch. He is forty-four years old this year and is a dedicated and labor-loving individual. Since he became a cadre more than ten years ago, except when seriously ill, he has always worked and labored simultaneously. When inspecting work in production teams or attending meetings outside, he either carries farming tools such as hoes and shovels to work with the masses or picks up manure along the way with a manure basket, never coming empty-handed. If there's a little time, he uses it, not letting a minute pass idly. In this way, he manages to work more than 250 labor days each year. He has done so many labor days each year, but it has not hindered his work. On the contrary, his work has become even more effective. He does his work in this way: taking work as the goal and labor as the method, closely integrating work and labor.
    Qiu Shilong doesn't have any other tricks; mainly, he follows the mass line. In production, he has a "think tank" and a "vanguard team." The "think tank" is composed of more than thirty experienced and progressive old farmers like Li Tingshan, Li Zhengbang, and Fang Jingfa; the "vanguard team" is composed of two hundred and seventy-one young people. During sowing and harvesting, he consults with them, absorbs their opinions, and organically combines new and old techniques. Therefore, the production seasons are grasped very accurately. But he said: "Only by following the mass line without being the masses' tail can things be done well." He will analyze and criticize backward, conservative, and one-sided incorrect ideas and never compromise or agree with them. Last autumn, when everyone discussed the issue of close planting, the young people advocated that the more seeds planted, the better, while the older people insisted on doing things according to the original method. At this time, he adhered to the instructions of the higher-level Party committee on "rational close planting." Based on the specific situation, he repeatedly discussed and researched with the young and old people and formulated a moderate seeding rate according to local conditions. As a result, this year, the 2,400 mu of wheat yielded an average of 135 jin per mu, an increase of nearly double compared to last year.
    He cares for the commune members more than himself. He is familiar with the situation of every one of the 302 households in the entire brigade. He can call out the names of each of the 1,398 people and knows their temperaments well. He became familiar with these people while working together. When the lonely old man Xu Xueqing, who has a limp, was sick, he carried him to the clinic for treatment, personally decocted medicine for him, delivered tea and water morning and evening, and cared for him with meticulous attention, just like caring for his own elders.
    A person who wholeheartedly serves the people will be respected and loved by the people from the bottom of their hearts. This spring, he became seriously ill. After the commune members learned about it, they carried him to the town more than ten miles away for treatment overnight. During his more than one month in the hospital, commune members came to see him every day. Xu Songqing, a blind man in his sixties who cannot see, asked someone to lead him to see him, saying: "Secretary, I feel depressed in my heart if I don't hear your voice for a few days. Hearing you speak makes my eyes light up." In the warm current of happiness, Qiu Shilong said with tears in his eyes: "I will work and labor even better to repay everyone's expectations of me!"

### 当干部十年一直参加劳动有一点时间挤一点时间　有一分钟挤一分钟

    当干部十年一直参加劳动有一点时间挤一点时间
  　有一分钟挤一分钟
    板浦人民公社六大队支部书记  丘士龙
    丘士龙同志是江苏灌云县板浦人民公社党委委员兼第六大队支部书记，今年四十四岁，是一个工作积极、热爱劳动的人。从他当干部到现在的十多年中，除有重病外，都是一边工作，一边劳动。到生产队检查工作或是出外开会，不是捎着锄头、铁锨等生产工具，和群众一起干活，就是挑着粪筐沿途捡粪，从未空过手。有一点时间，他就利用一点时间，不让空过一分钟。就这样，他每年都要做到二百五十个以上劳动日。他每年做了这么多的劳动日，但并未妨碍工作，相反地，工作搞得更有声有色了。他的工作是这样做的：以工作为目的，劳动为方法，把工作、劳动两者密切结合。
    丘士龙没有什么别的窍门，主要是他走了群众路线。在生产上，他有“参谋团”和“先锋队”。“参谋团”是由生产经验最丰富而又积极进步的老农民李廷珊、李正邦、方景发等三十多个人组成的；“先锋队”是由二百七十一个青年组成的。在播种收割时，他都和他们商量，吸取意见，有机地把新、老技术结合起来。因此，生产季节抓得很准。但他说：“走群众路线，而不做群众的尾巴，才能办好事情。”对落后保守和片面不正确的思想，他都要提出分析批判，绝不迁就附和。去年秋种时，大家讨论密植问题，年青人主张下种量越多越好，年老人却坚持照原来方法办事，双方争论不下。这时，他就坚持上级党委“合理密植”的指示。根据具体情况，和青年、老年人反复讨论研究，因地制宜地订出适中的下种量，结果，今年二千四百亩小麦平均每亩产麦一百三十五斤，比去年增产近一倍。
    他关心社员胜于关心自己。全大队三百零二户，家家的情况他都清楚，一千三百九十八口人，每个人的名字他都叫得出，谁个脾气他都摸得清，这些人都是他在一起劳动中熟识的。孤苦老人跛子徐学青有病，他把他背到诊所去看病，还亲手替他煎药，早晚送茶送水，问寒问暖，和服侍自家的老人一样，体贴入微。
    全心全意为人民服务的人，是会受到人民从心底里的尊敬和热爱的。今年春天他得了重病，社员知道后，连夜把他抬到十多里外的镇上医治。在住院的一个多月中，每天都有社员跑来看他。六十多岁的瞎子徐松青看不见走路，叫人领着去看他，说：“支书啊，我几天听不到你说话的声音，心里就闷得慌，听到你说句话，眼睛也亮了。”在幸福的暖流中，丘士龙激动得热泪直流地说：“我还要更好地工作和劳动，来报答大家对我的期望！”
