Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, 29th: A new national united front has been established in Iraq. This news was announced in a memorandum submitted to Prime Minister Qasim last night.

Among the 126 people who signed the memorandum were representatives of political parties such as the Iraqi Communist Party, the National Democratic Party, the Kurdistan Democratic Unity Party, representatives of all people's organizations and professional associations, and prominent political and social figures.

The memorandum stated that after discussing the factors that undermine national unity and studying the possible and practical solutions to help restore this unity in the best possible way, we felt it necessary to restore the national united front and turn it into an active national institution capable of mobilizing and uniting the people.

The memorandum continued, all agreed on the charter of this national united front. In this charter, we will specifically stipulate our common opinions on some major issues. This charter is a sacred oath of the forces united under the banner of the national united front now and in the future. The national united front will carry out joint activities under the leadership of Prime Minister Qasim.

The memorandum said, "Imperialism, in accordance with their traditional 'divide and rule' policy, has concentrated its efforts in the past few months on spreading suspicion among national forces in an attempt to undermine their unity and incite them to oppose each other. Imperialism has not been able to undermine (Iraq's) independence, overthrow the democratic republican system, and undermine your leadership. However, its purpose has not and will not change; it will not give up its efforts and conspiracies to restore its lost power, even if doing so would cause bloodshed throughout the country."

The memorandum emphasized that this situation has aroused the vigilance of the Iraqi people and increased their awareness. They have learned from the historical experience of other countries and demanded the reunification of national forces and the strengthening of their unity to defend the revolutionary achievements of the republic.

The charter of the national united front was also handed over to Qasim along with this memorandum.

    伊拉克许多政党和人民团体
    成立新的民族统一阵线
    新华社巴格达29日电　伊拉克成立了新的民族统一阵线。这个消息是在昨天晚上致卡塞姆总理的一项备忘录中宣布的。
    在备忘录上签名的一百二十六人中，有伊拉克共产党、国家民主党、库尔德斯坦统一民主党等政党的代表、所有人民团体和职业团体的代表以及著名的政界和社会人士。
    这个备忘录说，在讨论了破坏民族团结的因素和研究了以最好的形式来帮助恢复这种团结的可能和切实可行的解决办法以后，我们感到有必要恢复民族统一阵线，并把它变成一个能够动员和团结人民队伍的积极的民族机构。
    备忘录继续说，所有的人都一致同意这个民族统一阵线的宪章。在这个宪章中，我们将把我们对一些重大问题的共同意见具体地规定下来。这个宪章，是在现在和将来都团结在民族统一阵线的旗帜下的力量的一个神圣的誓言。民族统一阵线将在卡塞姆总理的领导下进行共同活动。
    备忘录说，“帝国主义按照它们传统的‘分而治之’政策，在过去几个月内集中力量在民族力量之间散布怀疑，以图破坏它们的团结和煽动它们相互反对。帝国主义没有能够破坏（伊拉克的）独立，推翻民主的共和国制度，和破坏你的领导。但是，它的目的并没有、也不会改变；它不会放弃那种要想恢复失去了的势力的努力和阴谋，那怕这样作会使这个国家遍地流血。”
    备忘录强调指出，这种局面引起了伊拉克人民的警惕和提高了他们的觉悟，他们吸取了其他国家的历史经验，要求重新统一民族队伍，加强它的团结以保卫共和国的革命成果。
    和这个备忘录同时交给卡塞姆的还有民族统一阵线宪章。
