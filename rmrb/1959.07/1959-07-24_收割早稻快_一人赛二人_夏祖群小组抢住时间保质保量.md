Rapid Early Rice Harvesting: One Person Outperforms Two
Xia Zuqun's Group Seizes the Time to Ensure Quality and Quantity

    This newspaper reports that the Xia Zuqun women's group, in the Nanxiang Brigade of the Nanxiang Commune in Heng County, Guangxi, has raised the red flag for rapid harvesting of early rice. On July 1st, their group of four people harvested a total of 5.1 mu of land (some of which had lodged rice), which was planted at a spacing of 6x5. On average, each person harvested 1.275 mu, more than twice the harvesting efficiency of the average commune member at that time, and the quality of the harvest was also very good. Since then, for ten days, they have maintained an efficiency of more than one mu of harvested rice per person per day, and are now striving for 1.5 to 2 mu per person. On July 1st, there were showers, and it was easy to lose grains and ears during harvesting, but they lost very little. The county party committee work group inspected two fen of land they had harvested and found only a dozen or so ears of rice left behind.

    At the end of June, the early rice in the Nanxiang Brigade matured successively, but it often rained, and the time for harvesting was very tight. Especially in the rice fields along the Yong River, if they were not harvested quickly, a heavy rain would cause the river water to rise, resulting in great losses. At this time, the harvesting progress of the entire brigade was still very slow, with 195 laborers harvesting an average of 0.35 mu per person per day.

    At a meeting on June 29th, the Party Branch Secretary and Brigade Leader, Comrade Du Peigen, analyzed the current situation and asked everyone to find ways to improve work efficiency. Xia Zuqun, the leader of the advanced group in the Xinxing Production Team of this brigade, heard this and resolved not to bow to difficulties, but to reverse the slow progress.

    Xia Zuqun is a woman in her forties, of poor peasant background. In the various production movements since liberation, she has always been a pioneer. In the past two years alone, she has won the title of model four times: township water conservancy model, charcoal-burning hero during the Great Leap Forward in steel production, rice transplanting expert, and field weeding pace-setter. This time, hearing the brigade leader say that if the harvest was not accelerated, the grain would be lost, she was determined to perform meritorious service in the harvest!

    The next day, Xia Zuqun and her team members Shang Xiuzhen, Lu Xiulan, and Lu Chunying exchanged experiences on how to harvest quickly and well, unified their understanding of the importance of doing a good job in the harvest, and made various preparations. At dawn on July 1st, they plunged into the harvest battle. With a rustling sound, large gaps quickly appeared in the golden rice fields. Of the four people in the group, Xia Zuqun harvested the fastest. She bent over, and her agility made it impossible to see her hand movements. After harvesting for a while, she turned around and saw that Lu Chunying was lagging behind. She immediately helped her improve her operating methods, and Lu Chunying also caught up. After ten hours of intense labor, the Xia Zuqun group finally created a new record of 1.275 mu of harvested rice per person per day.

    The Xia Zuqun group's experience in harvesting quickly is:

    (1) Prepare in advance. The day before, they went to the fields to survey the rice to be harvested, clarifying which were lodged, and how large each field was. They determined that fields of less than five fen should be harvested by one person to avoid crowding and hindering each other. Fields of more than five fen were harvested by two or four people together, each occupying a corner and harvesting towards the middle. If the rice was lodged, they harvested in the direction of the lodging to avoid the double handling of gathering the rice.

    (2) Don't chat idly; use hands, eyes, and feet together. When they harvested the rice, they concentrated their eyesight. After cutting a handful of rice, the left hand tied the bundle of rice, and the foot stepped the rice stubble into the mud (generally, people put down the sickle with their right hand after cutting, tie the bundle of rice with both hands, and then step on the rice stubble).

    (3) The thumb and the third, fourth, and fifth fingers of the left hand grasped a handful of rice stubble, and the index finger picked a few more stalks of rice, cutting them off in one stroke, even cutting the few stalks used for tying, and only using the left hand to tie the bundle. Unlike ordinary people, the index finger does not operate. After cutting a handful, they use their right hand to take a few stalks from the rice bundle to tie it, which wastes time.

    (4) After cutting a handful, they spread the bundle of rice and stand it up, so that they can harvest and dry at the same time, making it easier to pick up and reducing grain loss.

    Now, the experience of the Xia Zuqun group has spread throughout the Nanxiang Brigade. Each production team has formed a harvesting pace-setter group to compete with the Xia Zuqun group. Various processes such as plowing, harrowing, and transplanting late rice seedlings have also launched competitions. The progress of summer harvest and summer planting in Nanxiang Brigade has been rapidly improved, with harvesting increasing from more than 0.3 mu per person per day to about 0.5 mu, and plowing accelerating from more than 0.6 mu per person per day to 0.98 mu.

### 收割早稻快　一人赛二人  夏祖群小组抢住时间保质保量

    收割早稻快　一人赛二人
    夏祖群小组抢住时间保质保量
    本报讯　夏祖群妇女小组，在广西横县南乡公社南乡大队举起了快收快割的夏收红旗。7月1日，她们全组四个人共割了五亩一分田（其中有的是禾已倒伏），这些田插的是6×5的规格，平均每人割了一亩二分七厘五，比当时当地一般社员割禾效率提高两倍多，收割的质量也很好。从这以后，十天来，她们一直保持每人日割禾一亩以上的效率，现在正向每人割一亩五分到两亩努力。7月1日那天有阵雨，割禾本来是很容易掉粒、掉穗的，但她们掉的却很少。县委工作组临田检查了他们收割过的两分田，只发现漏掉十多个禾穗。
    6月底，南乡大队的早稻陆续成熟，但是天常常下雨，抢收时间已很紧迫。特别是在邕江畔的稻田如果不快割，大雨一来，江水上涨，就会受到很大的损失。而这时，全大队的收割进度还很慢，一百九十五个劳动力，平均每天每人割三分五厘田。
    在6月29日的一次会议上，党支书、大队长杜培根同志分析了当前这些情况，要求大家想办法提高工效。这个大队的新兴生产队标兵组长夏祖群听了，下定决心，不向困难低头，一定要扭转进度缓慢的局面。
    夏祖群是四十多岁的妇女，贫农成份，在解放后的历次生产运动中，都是打先锋。光在去、今两年，就先后四次获得模范称号：乡的水利模范，大办钢铁时的烧炭英雄，插秧能手，耘田标兵。这次，听到大队长说不加快割，谷子就会受到损失，她决心要在抢收中立功！
    第二天，夏祖群和她的组员商秀珍、卢秀兰、卢春英交流了收快收好的经验，统一了搞好抢收的重要意义的认识，做好了各种准备。7月1日天刚亮，她们就投入抢收战斗。只听得唰唰一阵响声，金黄色的稻田马上现出大块大块的缺口。全组四个人，割的最快的是夏祖群。她弯着腰，敏捷得使人看不到手的动作。割了一会儿，她回过头来，看到卢春英丢在后面，立即帮助她改进操作方法，卢春英也跟上来了。经过十个小时的紧张劳动，夏祖群小组终于创造了每人每日割禾一亩二分七厘五的新成绩。
    夏祖群小组割得快的经验是：
    （1）事前作好准备。她们在头一天就到田里勘查要割的禾，把那些是倒伏的禾、那块田有多大，都弄得清清楚楚。确定五分以下的田块一人割一块，以免挤在一起，互相妨碍；五分以上的田才由两人或四人在一块割，割时各占一角，向中间割去。要是禾倒伏了，人便顺着禾弯倒的方向割去，这样，拢禾才不致费两道手续。
      （2）不讲闲话，手、眼、脚并用。她们割禾的时候，眼力集中，一把禾割下之后，左手一边扎禾把，脚一边把禾蔸踩下泥去（一般人是：割完之后，右手放下镰刀，两手扎禾把，扎完再踩禾蔸）。
    （3）左手的大拇指和第三、四、五三个手指抓着一把禾蔸，剩下食指另外挑几根禾过来，一刀割去，连捆扎的几根禾都割了，光用左手捆扎。不像一般人食指不操作，割下一把后，再用右手从禾把中抽出几根来捆扎，耽误了时间。
    （4）割完一把，顺手将禾把散开竖放，作到一边割一边晒，挑时轻，脱粒少。
    现在，夏祖群小组的经验已在全南乡大队传播开来。各生产队都组成了割禾标兵组，同夏祖群组竞赛。犁田的，耙田的，插晚稻秧的各种工序也都展开了竞赛。南乡大队夏收夏种进度迅速提高，割禾由每人日割三分多提高到五分左右，犁田由每人日六分多加快到九分八。（附图片）
