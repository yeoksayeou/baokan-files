Party Secretary Sets Example by Diligently Studying
Taicang Litai Yarn Factory's Employee Continuing Education Progresses Normally

    (Our report) This newspaper reports: Comrade Chen Yingcai, Party Secretary of the Litai Yarn Factory in Taicang County, Jiangsu Province, takes the lead in persisting in after-work cultural studies and is also very concerned about the studies of the employees, thus enabling the normal progress of the factory's employee continuing education.
    Comrade Chen Yingcai only studied in a private school for a few years when he was young. When he was sixteen years old, he went to a shipbuilding factory as an apprentice. After participating in the revolution, his cultural level has also greatly improved through practical struggle. Not long after arriving at the factory, he introduced his past learning situation to the after-work school and asked to join a class to continue his studies. He said: "To engage in revolution and construction, one must study hard." He also said: "In the past, workers had no right to learn culture. Why not study hard today?" He usually studies seriously and completes his homework on time. During the Spring Festival this year, the teacher assigned a composition and twenty algebra problems. He and the factory director completed the twenty algebra problems on New Year's Eve. Once, he went to Suzhou for a meeting. Before leaving, he said to the teacher: I am going to Suzhou for a meeting, probably for a week. What content will be taught next week? I will take it with me for self-study. The teacher was afraid that he was too tired, so he said to him: Make it up when you come back! But he replied: No! I can squeeze out time to study during the meeting. After returning from the meeting, he indeed completed the self-study task, and the homework that should be done was also done.
  In addition to self-study, Comrade Chen Yingcai also attached great importance to the continuing education of all employees in the factory. Because he himself participated in the study, it was easier to discover problems in learning and find solutions in a timely manner. For example, in the middle of the term, some students reflected: "I can't eat it, I can't remember it." He said to the teacher: Is the current teaching progress a bit too fast? All work should pay attention to practical results. You should study this issue. The school organized teachers to study the reasons for the low teaching quality at that time. Everyone believed that there were indeed shortcomings in the teaching, such as "rushing progress and ignoring quality." Therefore, the teaching plan was immediately revised, and classroom teaching and after-school tutoring were emphasized, which improved the teaching quality.
    Under the influence of the Party Secretary taking the lead in learning, cadres above the team leader level in the factory have participated in cultural learning and become the backbone of learning. Although this factory is an old factory, and the average age of the workers is over thirty-seven years old, the number of employees enrolled accounts for more than 80% of the total number of employees. When production is tight, the Party Committee can also flexibly arrange time and adhere to learning. Secretary Chen said: We have a deep understanding ourselves. Once classes are stopped, it is easy to forget what we have learned. Therefore, we must arrange our after-work time scientifically and try our best not to stop classes.
    Due to the development of continuing education in the factory, the cultural level of the vast number of employees has been improved, and it has also played a certain role in promoting production. In the first quarter of this year, the factory was rated as an outstanding cotton textile factory in the Suzhou area. The quality of cotton yarn in May and June has also gradually improved, and the standard product rate in June reached 100%.

### 党委书记苦钻苦学树立榜样  太仓利泰纱厂职工业余教育正常开展

    党委书记苦钻苦学树立榜样
    太仓利泰纱厂职工业余教育正常开展
    本报讯　江苏省太仓县利泰纱厂党委书记陈英才同志，带头坚持业余文化学习，还十分关心职工的学习，因而使全厂的职工业余教育正常开展。
    陈英才同志小时候只读了几年私塾，当他十六岁的那年，就到一个造海船厂内当徒工。他参加革命后，通过实际斗争的锻炼，文化水平也有了很大提高。到厂不久，他就向业余学校介绍他过去的学习情况，要求插入班级继续学习。他说：“搞革命，搞建设，就得好好学习。”又说：“过去工人没权利学文化，今天为什么还不好好学习。”他平时一贯认真学习，按时完成课外作业。今年春节期间，教师布置了一篇作文和二十个代数题，他和厂长在大除夕晚上就完成了二十个代数题。有一次，他到苏州去开会，临走时，他对教师说：我到苏州去开会，大概要一星期，下星期教什么内容，我带出去自学。教师怕他太疲劳了，对他说：回来补吧！可是他回答说：不！会议期间能挤出时间来学习。开会回来后，他果然完成了自学任务，应做的作业也做好了。
  除了自学外，陈英才同志也十分重视全厂的职工业余教育。由于他自己参加学习，因此也就容易发现学习中的问题，并及时想办法解决。如在期中，有些学员反映：“吃不了，记不牢”。他就对教师说：目前教学进度是否快了一些，一切工作要注意实际效果，这个问题，你们研究研究。学校就组织教师研究当前教学质量低的原因，大家都认为教学中确实存在“赶进度，不顾质量”的缺点，于是，立即修订了教学计划，重视了课堂教学和课外辅导工作，提高了教学质量。
    在党委书记带头学习的影响下，这个厂小组长以上的干部，都参加了文化学习，成为学习中的骨干。这个厂虽然是个老厂，工人平均年龄在三十七岁以上，但职工入学人数却占职工总数80％以上。在生产紧张的时候，党委也能灵活安排时间，坚持学习。陈书记说：我们自己有深刻体会，一停课，学过的东西容易忘记。所以，我们要做到科学地安排业余时间，尽可能不停课。
    由于该厂业余教育的开展，提高了广大职工的文化水平，同时对生产也起了一定的促进作用。今年第一季度，这个厂被评为苏州专区棉纺织厂的优胜厂，5月、6月份的棉纱质量，也逐步提高，6月份标准品率达100％。
