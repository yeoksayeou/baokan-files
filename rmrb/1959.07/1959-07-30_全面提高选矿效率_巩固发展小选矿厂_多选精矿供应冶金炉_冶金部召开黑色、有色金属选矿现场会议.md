Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, July 29th. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the Heavy Industry Trade Union recently held a national on-site conference on ferrous and non-ferrous metal ore dressing in Tongguanshan, Anhui Province, calling on all ferrous and non-ferrous metal ore dressing workers across the country to select more and better ores to meet the needs of metallurgical furnace production.

The conference pointed out that ore dressing production is an important process in the metallurgical industry. By refining and enriching lean ores and removing harmful impurities, the metal recovery rate and the recovery of various useful minerals in the ore can be greatly improved. It can also save metallurgical fluxes and coke, and reduce production costs.

The conference believes that in recent years, ore dressing plants in various regions have gained a lot of experience in ore dressing methods, equipment, and flotation reagents, and ore dressing output has increased significantly in the first half of this year. In order to further improve ore dressing production capacity and ensure the fulfillment and overfulfillment of this year's production tasks, all ore dressing plants must continue to deeply mobilize the masses, carry out socialist competitions around high yield, high quality, high work efficiency, and safe production, and comprehensively improve the four major ore dressing indicators: metal recovery rate, concentrate grade, grinding mill utilization coefficient, and equipment operation rate. At the same time, it is necessary to establish and improve necessary systems such as ore dressing technical procedures, technical operation cards, and shift handover, strengthen technical and economic analysis, and do a good job in equipment maintenance to ensure normal equipment operation. The conference also required all factories to strengthen on-site experimental research work, carry out the comprehensive utilization of ore, better learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and fraternal countries, and implement expert advice.

The conference believes that some small ore dressing plants established in various regions have the advantages of low investment, quick results, simple equipment manufacturing, easy technical operation, and the ability to fully utilize underground resources. All regions that have built such small ore dressing plants should further consolidate and improve them, and regions with suitable conditions should develop small ore dressing plants.

At the meeting, ore dressing experiences from Tongguanshan Copper Mine and Nanfen Iron Mine were also exchanged. After adopting a series of measures such as original ore desliming, increasing the area of the screening machine, rationally adding steel balls, implementing re-grinding and re-election of middlings, secondary beneficiation and centralized beneficiation, and centralized ore supply, Tongguanshan Copper Mine achieved a comprehensive leap forward in the four major ore dressing indicators. In May and June this year, the average recovery rate of copper concentrate metal increased by 2% compared with the average recovery rate from January to April; the grade of copper concentrate, the utilization coefficient of grinding mills, and the equipment operation rate also increased significantly. These experiences have been highly valued by representatives from various regions.

Representatives from twenty-four provinces (regions) participated in the conference. Soviet ore dressing experts from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry also participated in the conference.

    全面提高选矿效率　巩固发展小选矿厂
    多选精矿供应冶金炉
    冶金部召开黑色、有色金属选矿现场会议
    新华社合肥29日电　冶金工业部和重工业工会最近在安徽省铜官山召开了全国黑色、有色金属选矿现场会议，要求全国黑色有色金属选矿职工，选出更多更好的矿石供应冶金炉生产的需要。
    会议指出，选矿生产是冶金工业的一道重要工序。把贫矿精选富集，除去矿石有害杂质，就能大大提高金属回收率和回收矿石中的多种有用矿物；并能节约冶金熔剂和焦炭，降低生产成本。
    会议认为，几年来各地选矿厂在选矿方法、选矿设备、浮选药剂等方面取得了不少经验，今年上半年选矿产量又有很大提高。为了进一步提高选矿生产能力，保证完成和超额完成今年的生产任务，各选矿厂必须继续深入发动群众，围绕高产、高质、高工效和安全生产，开展社会主义竞赛，全面提高选矿金属回收率、精矿品位、磨矿机利用系数和设备运转率等选矿四大指标，同时，建立与健全选矿的技术规程、技术操作卡片、交接班等必要的制度，加强技术经济分析，做好设备维护工作，保证设备正常运转。会议还要求各厂加强现场试验研究工作，开展矿石的综合利用，更好地学习苏联及兄弟国家先进经验，贯彻执行专家建议。
    会议认为各地建立的一些小型选矿厂，具有投资少、收效快、设备制造简单、技术操作容易、能充分利用地下资源等优点。凡是已经建设起这种小型选矿厂的地区，要进一步巩固和提高，有条件的地区要发展小选厂。
    会上还交流了铜官山铜矿、南芬铁矿等地的选矿经验。铜官山铜矿采取原矿脱泥、加大筛分机面积、合理补加钢球、实行中矿再磨再选、二次精选和集中精选、集中供矿等一系列办法后，使选矿四大指标获得了全面跃进。今年5、6月份，铜精砂金属的平均回收率，比1至4月份的平均回收率提高了2％；铜精矿品位、磨矿机利用系数和设备运转率也有很大提高。这些经验受到了各地代表的重视。
    参加这次会议的有二十四个省（区）的代表。冶金工业部苏联选矿专家也参加了这次会议。
