Humbly Learn from the Advanced, Double the Output
Guangdong Leinan County Yingli Commune Tianfeng Brigade Achieves Great Early Rice Harvest

    (Our Dispatch) By humbly learning from the successful experiences of advanced brigades, the production outlook of Tianfeng Brigade in Yingli Commune, Leinan County, Guangdong Province, has rapidly changed, resulting in a large-scale bumper harvest of early rice, with both per-mu yield and total output doubling compared to last year.

              Taking the Advanced as Teachers

    The Nanfeng Brigade, adjacent to Tianfeng Brigade, has been a high-yield banner on the Leizhou Peninsula since the cooperativization movement. However, Tianfeng Brigade was the most backward and lowest-yielding production team in Yingli Commune. For a long time, the cadres and members of Tianfeng Brigade did not dare to compare their production with Nanfeng Brigade. It was only during the Great Leap Forward last year that Tianfeng Brigade reluctantly responded to the challenge and competed with Nanfeng Brigade under compelling circumstances. At that time, both sides agreed that after the harvest, they would compare yields to determine the winner, with the winner becoming the teacher and the loser presenting the winner with a large red flag embroidered with the words "Take the Advanced as Teacher."

    Needless to say, after the autumn harvest last year, Tianfeng Brigade presented the red flag of "Take the Advanced as Teacher" to Nanfeng Brigade. This caused a great reaction among the cadres and members. Some said that losing was a good thing, and now they would honestly learn from others. The members' opinions greatly enlightened the cadres.

    But why was Nanfeng Brigade advanced? Why was Tianfeng Brigade backward? The cadres and members held several meetings and discussions to compare conditions, compare enthusiasm, and find reasons. It turned out that the members of Nanfeng Brigade had migrated from Xinyi County to reclaim wasteland four years ago, and their farming methods had always been very meticulous. The soil, water conservancy, sunshine, and other conditions of Tianfeng Brigade and Nanfeng Brigade were similar, but Nanfeng Brigade had focused on the key to increasing production in recent years, vigorously improving the soil quality, and turning barren mountain pit fields into fertile fields. Tianfeng Brigade, however, believed that its conditions were poor and had never improved the soil quality. The mountain pit fields became acidic every year, and more than half of the seedlings often died from the acidity. In addition, Nanfeng Brigade had a set of experiences and systems from seed selection and seedling cultivation to mid-tillage and fertilization, while Tianfeng Brigade did it very roughly. Last year, 80% of the early rice seeds were inferior, and some single-cropping fields were neither weeded nor top-dressed.

    After such an investigation, the cadres and members felt that there were many experiences that Tianfeng Brigade could learn from Nanfeng Brigade. Therefore, in the severe cold of December, the cadres took the lead in going up the mountain to cut green manure to improve the soil quality, plowed all the paddy fields before the Spring Festival, and eliminated all inferior seeds, replaced them with improved varieties, and sowed the seedlings early. When the members saw that the cadres' actions were very different from before, their enthusiasm also increased. They said, "This is what it looks like to learn from the advanced and catch up with the advanced!" Soon, a surge of studying farming methods and reforming farming techniques was set off throughout the brigade.

              Dissecting a Single Rice Plant

    After Tianfeng Brigade began to learn from Nanfeng and catch up with Nanfeng, cadres and members often went to Nanfeng Brigade in batches to visit and learn, humbly seeking advice.

    Before the Spring Festival, when it was cold and drizzling, Nanfeng Brigade began transplanting the first batch of rice seedlings. Brigade Leader Huang Daosheng immediately rushed to Nanfeng Brigade with Deputy Brigade Leader Huang Feiliao, Group Leader Ye Rigui, and more than ten others to visit. They came to a green rice field that had just been transplanted, and while admiring it, they could not help but gently dig up a seedling to examine it carefully.

    What a strong seedling! The stem was thick, the leaves were wide, and the seedling head was fat and more than an inch thick. Although it had not been transplanted for long, long white root hairs had grown around it. Why were the seedlings of Nanfeng so strong? Why were they not afraid of soil acidity? Why did they turn green and sprout roots as soon as they were transplanted? The cadres of Nanfeng Brigade explained everything to them. It turned out that the fields of Nanfeng Brigade had also often suffered from acidity and seedling death in the past. In addition to improving the soil quality in recent years, they had also used superphosphate mixed with human and animal manure as seedling head fertilizer. This allowed the newly transplanted seedlings to absorb fertilizer in time, quickly sprout roots and turn green, the soil near the seedlings was not easily acidic, and the seedlings grew faster, which also enhanced their resistance to acidity. The cadres of Tianfeng Brigade were greatly convinced after hearing this. They all believed that learning from Nanfeng Brigade's experience of using seedling head fertilizer to treat acidity was a key measure to strive for increased early rice production and should be immediately promoted throughout the brigade.

    After returning to the village, the cadres publicized and explained to the masses while digging up cattle manure and sifting sheep droppings. On the first day of the Lunar New Year, as soon as the firecrackers celebrating the Spring Festival rang, the cadres took the lead in fermenting seedling head fertilizer. As a result, more than 700 mu of early rice in the entire brigade were transplanted after applying seedling head fertilizer, and the problem of soil acidity in mountain pit fields for many years was solved. Even the seedlings in Baotian Pit, where the soil quality was the worst, grew green. Only the seedlings that were intentionally left as the opposite and not fertilized with seedling head fertilizer grew yellow and weak, sparse and scattered.

    Since the promotion of seedling head fertilizer achieved significant results, Tianfeng Brigade learned from Nanfeng Brigade even more diligently. Every few days, they would send people to Nanfeng to take a look, and the cadres of Nanfeng Brigade also tirelessly gave them guidance and help. During mid-tillage, they learned Nanfeng's irrigation and drainage methods; when rescuing backward rice, they learned from Nanfeng how to apply fertilizer according to different categories. The farming methods of the entire brigade gradually became more meticulous.

          Improving Working Methods

    The cadres of Tianfeng Brigade humbly learned the methods of intensive cultivation from Nanfeng Brigade, and they also learned the style of Nanfeng Brigade's cadres and the masses being united as one, discussing everything with the masses, and listening to their opinions.

    Once, when the cadres of Tianfeng Brigade went to Nanfeng Brigade to visit, they saw that all the cadres of Nanfeng Brigade were acting as field managers, working with the members in the fields. They discussed and arranged work while intertilling and topdressing with the members. This scene greatly inspired the cadres of Tianfeng Brigade, so they asked the cadres of Nanfeng Brigade not only to introduce production technology, but also to introduce how to lead the masses to promote new technologies.

    Since then, the cadres of Tianfeng Brigade have also made great improvements in their working methods. Whenever a new measure is implemented, the cadres take the lead in taking action and setting an example before promoting it. Like the cadres of Nanfeng Brigade, everyone went to the fields to be a field manager. In this way, the opinions of the masses could be quickly reflected to the higher levels, and the decisions of the team could be quickly implemented among the masses. When transplanting early rice, the planting specifications stipulated by the team were two by three and two by four. At first, the members reflected that planting so densely was too dense, and the cadres did not pay much attention to it. Later, as they planted, the work efficiency decreased and the members' opinions increased. The cadres immediately became alert. They found old farmers and production team leaders to study. Old farmer Xiang Ran said, "As the saying goes, one rice plant needs a bowl of mud, just like one person eating a bowl of rice. Now several people are eating one bowl of rice, aren't everyone starving?" The team leaders also believed that "Too sparse is not good, too dense is not good, we should learn from the lessons of lodging and reduced production after high-density planting of some seedlings in the late rice last year." So everyone decided to change the specifications of two by three and two by four to three by four and three by five. As a result, the masses were happy and the transplanting work was done quickly and well. Now the facts have also come to the conclusion that the growth of the three by four and three by five specifications is better than the two by three and two by four specifications, and they do not lodge, and each mu can harvest dozens of catties more grain.

    Now Tianfeng Brigade is learning from the advanced experience of Nanfeng Brigade more humbly. "Students can catch up with and surpass their teachers." The cadres and members of Tianfeng Brigade have this confidence.

    虚心学先进  产量成倍增
    广东雷南县英利公社田丰大队早稻大丰收
    本报讯　虚心拜师，认真学习先进大队的成功经验，广东雷南县英利公社田丰大队生产面貌迅速改变，早稻大面积丰收，亩产量和总产量都比去年跃增一倍。
              拜先进为师
      和田丰大队毗邻的南丰大队，从合作化以来，一直是雷州半岛的高产旗帜。可是田丰队却是英利公社生产最落后、产量最低的一个队。长期以来，田丰队的干部和社员都不敢同南丰队比生产，只是去年大跃进的时候，田丰队在迫人的形势下，才勉强同南丰队应战竞赛。当时双方言定，在收割后评比产量定胜负，胜者为师，负方要给胜方送一幅绣有“拜先进为师”字样的大红旗。
    不用说，去年秋收后，田丰队把“拜先进为师”的红旗送给了南丰队。这一来，在干部和社员中间引起了很大的反应。有的说输了倒有好处，这回可要老老实实向人家学习了。社员的意见，使干部们得到很大的启发。
    可是，南丰队为什么先进？田丰队为什么落后呢？干部和社员一连几次开会座谈，大家比条件、比干劲、找原因。原来南丰队的社员是四年以前从信宜县迁移到这里开荒的，他们的耕作方法一向很细致。田丰队和南丰队的土质、水利、阳光等条件都差不多，但是南丰队几年来抓紧增产关键，大力改良土质，把瘦瘠的山坑田改成了肥田。田丰队却认为自己的条件差，一直没有改良土质，山坑田年年发酸，秧苗往往酸死过半。还有，南丰队从选种、育秧到中耕、施肥都有一套经验和制度，田丰队却做得十分粗糙，去年早造有八成种子是劣种，有部分单造田不除草也追肥。
    经过这样一查，干部和社员都觉得，南丰队有不少经验是可以学习的。于是，在严寒的12月，干部带头上山割绿肥改良土质，把全部稻田犁转才过春节，还淘汰了全部劣种，改用良种，提前播秧。社员看见干部的做法和以前大不相同，劲头也大了。他们说：“这才像个学先进、赶先进的样子啊！”很快地，全大队掀起了一股钻研耕作方法、改革耕作技术的热潮。
              解剖一棵禾
    田丰队开始学南丰、赶南丰以后，干部和社员经常分批到南丰队参观学习，虚心求教。
    春节前，正值寒风细雨的时节，南丰队开始插第一批稻秧了。大队长黄道生马上和副队长黄妃寮、组长叶日贵等十多人赶到南丰队参观。他们来到一片绿色的刚刚移植过的禾田边，一边赞叹，一边不禁轻轻地挖起一棵秧苗来细看。
    这是一棵多么茁壮的秧苗！茎骨粗大，叶子宽阔，秧头肥足足有一寸多厚，虽然插下不久，但周围已长出很长的白色根须。为什么南丰的秧这么壮？为什么不怕田土反酸？为什么刚插下就回青出根？…… 南丰队的干部向他们一一解释清楚。原来南丰队的田地过去也常常反酸死秧，几年来他们除了改良土质以外，还用过磷酸钙混合人畜粪作秧头肥，这样可以使刚插下的秧苗及时吸收到肥分，迅速出根转青，秧苗附近的泥土不易反酸，同时秧苗生长得快，也增强了抗酸的能力。田丰队的干部听了大为信服。他们都认为学习南丰队用秧头肥治酸的经验，是争取早造增产的一项关键措施，应该立刻在全队推广。
    回村以后，干部一边向群众宣传解释，一边就动手挖牛栏粪、筛羊屎。年初一那天，迎春的爆竹刚刚响过，干部就带头沤制秧头肥。结果，全队七百多亩早稻都经过施秧头肥才插秧，多年来山坑田反酸的问题解决了。连土质最差的宝田坑，禾苗也长得一片青绿。只有那块有意留作对立面而没有施秧头肥的禾苗，才长得黄黄弱弱，疏疏零零。
    自从推广秧头肥获得显著成效以后，田丰队向南丰队学习得更勤了。隔不了几天，他们就要派人到南丰去看看，南丰队的干部也不倦地给他们指点帮忙。中耕的时候，他们学习南丰的排灌方法；抢救落后禾的时候，他们向南丰学习分类施肥，全队的耕作方法渐渐细致了。
          改进工作方法
    田丰队的干部虚心向南丰队学习了精耕细作方法，他们还学习了南丰队干部和群众打成一片，事事和群众商量，听取群众意见的作风。
    有一次，田丰队的干部到南丰队去参观，看到南丰大队干部个个都当田间管理员，正在和社员一起劳动。他们一边和社员在中耕追肥，一边就商量布置工作。这种情景大大启发了田丰队的干部，于是他们要求南丰队的干部不仅介绍生产技术，而且要介绍怎样领导群众推行新技术。
    从此以后，田丰队的干部在工作方法上也有了很大的改进，每当推行一项新的措施时，干部都带头动手，做出榜样，再行推广。他们也像南丰队的干部一样，人人都到田间去当管理员。这样，群众的意见很快就能反映到上面，队里的决定也能很快贯彻到群众中去。早造插秧的时候，队里规定的插秧规格是二乘三、二乘四。开始，社员就反映说这样插太密，干部还不大在意，后来越插下去，工作效率越低，社员意见也越大，干部立刻警觉起来。他们找老农和生产小队长来研究。老农象冉说：“俗话讲，一棵禾要一碗泥，这正如一个人吃一碗饭，现在一碗饭几个人吃，不是大家都挨饿吗？”小队长们也认为：“太疏不好，太密也不好，应该吸取去年晚造部分禾苗高度密植后倒伏减产的教训。”于是大家便决定把二乘三、二乘四的规格改为三乘四、三乘五。这一来，群众心情舒畅，插秧工作做得又快又好。现在事实也作出了结论，插三乘四、三乘五规格的比插二乘三、二乘四的生长好，不倒伏，每亩可多收好几十斤谷。
    现在田丰队更虚心地学习南丰队的先进经验。“学生是可以赶上和超过先生的。”田丰队的干部和社员都有这个信心。
