People's communes purchased a considerable amount of industrial equipment, raw materials, and other supplies from various places when they started running industries last year. Among these materials, many are surplus or temporarily not needed; some were originally usable but are now not needed; and some were never needed after being purchased. A large portion of these stockpiled and stagnant materials (some stockpiled in the commune's warehouses, some stockpiled in the commune's supply and marketing cooperatives) are urgently needed for current industrial production and construction. Now, it is of great significance for the people's communes to clear out this portion of stockpiled and stagnant materials, adjust surpluses and deficiencies, and allow these materials to play their role to the maximum extent in the places where they are most needed, in order to guarantee the needs of industrial departments for production and construction. This is also an aspect of the current campaign to increase production and practice economy.

When it comes to tapping the potential of materials, people always think of large factories and enterprises first. This makes some sense. Large factories and enterprises have large operations, and generally speaking, their material potential is also very large. People's communes, however, only run some small factories, and even if they have stockpiled materials, they are much less than those of large factories and enterprises, even negligible. But this only sees one side of the problem. The other side of the problem is that if we note the fact that there are not one or two people's communes but more than 20,000, the situation is different. Any raw material divided among more than 20,000 units is a small number, but when concentrated, it is a huge number. Take small hardware like nails as an example. If each commune stockpiles 100 jin of nails, this is not much. But if we multiply that by 20,000, that is 2 million jin. Who can say that 2 million jin is a negligible number? Of course, this is just an analogy. It is also possible that some communes have no stockpiled nails at all. But whether it is stockpiled nails or not; stockpiled this kind of material or stockpiled that kind of material, the accounts should always be calculated in this way. Recognizing this point, it is not difficult to understand the important significance of people's communes clearing warehouse materials and adjusting surpluses and deficiencies.

Moreover, the stockpiled and stagnant materials of many people's communes are not "negligible." According to some investigation materials, the materials stockpiled by some people's communes and people's communes' supply and marketing cooperatives are of all kinds, and some communes have also stockpiled some valuable equipment, and the quantity of materials stockpiled by some communes is not small. For example, the recent warehouse cleanup by the Tianjin Xinli Village People's Commune Supply and Marketing Cooperative found that the total value of stockpiled and stagnant commodities reached 350,000 yuan. Among them, the market urgently needs yuan nails, which are stockpiled more than 130,000 jin, lead wire stockpiled 38,000 jin, various electrical wires stockpiled 170,000 meters, and light bulbs stockpiled 35,000. The recent warehouse cleanup by the Pingluo People's Commune Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Mengjin County, Henan Province, found that the value of commodities not suitable for rural sales was more than 120,000 yuan. These include tungsten wire for making light bulbs, a large number of electrical equipment, various car tires, and valuable materials such as drilling machines. For example, Chaoyang County, Liaoning Province, recently launched a mass warehouse cleanup campaign involving people's communes, management districts, and production brigades, and cleaned up a total of 120 kinds of agricultural and sideline products from 2,100 warehouses throughout the county, including seed cotton, lint cotton, sesame, sunflower seeds, castor seeds, soybeans, peanuts, wool, honey, etc., worth 670,000 yuan. These are just a few examples from a few regions. If every people's commune seriously cleans up the materials stockpiled and stagnant in the warehouses, there will definitely be a lot of "harvests."

People's communes clearing out stockpiled and stagnant industrial equipment, raw materials, and other materials, adjusting surpluses and deficiencies, and supporting the needs of production and construction is not only good for the country, but also primarily beneficial to the people's communes themselves. This year, the tasks on the agricultural production front are quite arduous. Now, people's communes across the country are concentrating their efforts on vigorously developing agricultural production and diversified operations, striving for a bumper autumn harvest, in order to provide the country with more commodity grain, non-staple food, and raw materials for light industry. To better develop agricultural production and diversified operations, in addition to sufficient labor and rational arrangement and use, there also needs to be sufficient funds to purchase various agricultural production materials needed for expanded reproduction. These funds, of course, mainly rely on the people's communes themselves to solve. Now, people's communes clearing out stockpiled and stagnant equipment, raw materials, and other materials, adjusting surpluses and deficiencies, or selling them to the state, can greatly accelerate the turnover of commune production funds and enrich and expand the source of agricultural and sideline production funds. This is undoubtedly a very favorable condition for striving for this year's agricultural harvest and rapidly developing sideline production.

Some cadres and business personnel of people's communes have this idea: clearing warehouses, clearing out stockpiled and stagnant materials, and supporting the needs of urban production and construction is certainly a good thing, but they always feel that things are better to store up, and take them whenever they are needed, which is more convenient. This idea is understandable, but it is not appropriate. It should be seen that keeping useful materials stockpiled in warehouses for a long time, no matter how useful they are, are dead things, and people cannot use them to create value. If we now take out the stockpiled materials, adjust surpluses and deficiencies, and support the needs of urban production and construction, we can quickly turn "dead objects" into "living objects," so that they can play their role fully and in a timely manner, which can promote the development of production quickly and well. Besides, it also costs a certain amount of manpower and material resources to keep these materials, and some more valuable equipment and raw materials will suffer losses if they are not properly stored. If this happens, it will be even more uneconomical for the people's communes.

Recently, the industrial and mining enterprise departments in various provinces and cities, after cleaning up warehouses, have tapped a large number of materials urgently needed by the market, adjusted surpluses and deficiencies, and achieved great results. We believe that as long as the people's communes seriously attach importance to warehouse cleanup work, they will surely achieve good results in a relatively short period of time.

Cleaning up materials and adjusting surpluses and deficiencies is not a simple task. To do this work well, it must be carried out under unified leadership. The county-level Party committees and relevant leading departments should designate special personnel to be responsible for helping the people's communes clean up materials. On the one hand, it is necessary to ensure that the communes' stockpiled and stagnant materials are fully adjusted out or sold to the state, and on the other hand, it is also necessary to take into account the rational reserve of raw materials necessary for commune production. For departments that need raw materials, they should also be reasonably allocated and adjusted according to the degree of need, distinguishing between priority and urgency, so that these stockpiled and stagnant equipment and materials can be smoothly put into production.

### 人民公社也要清理一下仓库物资

    人民公社也要清理一下仓库物资
    去年乡社开始办工业的时候，人民公社向各地采购了不少工业器材、原料和其它物资。在这些物资当中，有不少是多余的或暂时不需要的；有些是原来可用的，现在用不着了；也还有一部分是买来以后根本用不着的。这些积压和呆滞的物资（有的积压在公社的仓库里，有的积压在公社的供销部里）有很大一部分是当前工业生产和建设上急需的。现在，人民公社把这一部分积压和呆滞的物资清理出来，调剂有无，让这些物资在最需要的地方，最大限度地发挥作用，以保证工业部门生产建设的需要，是有很大意义的。这也是当前开展增产节约运动的一个方面。
    一提起挖掘物资潜力，人们总会先想到大工厂、大企业。这有一定的道理。大工厂、大企业，家大业大，一般地说来物资潜力也很大。而人民公社不过是办了一些小工厂，即便有积压的物资，和大工厂、大企业比起来也少得多，甚至是微乎其微的。但是这还仅仅看到了问题的一面。问题的另一面是，如果我们注意到人民公社不是一个、两个而是两万多个这一事实的话，情况就不同了，任何一种原材料分给两万多个单位都是一个微小的数字，而集中起来却又是一个巨大的数字。就拿钉子这样的小五金打个比方吧，如果每个公社积压一百斤钉子，这本来不算多。但是如果用两万这个数字一乘，那就是两百万斤。两百万斤，谁又能说这个数字是个微小的数字呢？当然，这不过是一个比喻。也可能有的公社根本没有积压钉子。但是不管是积压钉子也好，没积压钉子也好；积压这样的物资也好，积压那样的物资也好，账总是应该这样计算的。认清这一点，那就不难明白人民公社清理仓库物资和调剂有无的重要意义了。
    更何况许多人民公社积压和呆滞的物资又不是“微乎其微”的呢。根据一些调查材料来看，一些人民公社和人民公社的供销部积压的物资五花八门，而且有的公社还积压了一些贵重的器材，有的公社积压的物资数量也不小。例如天津新立村人民公社供销部最近清理仓库的结果，发现积压和呆滞的商品总值达三十五万元。其中仅当前市场急需的元钉就积压了十三万多斤，铅丝积压了三万八千斤，各种电线积压了十七万公尺，灯泡积压了三万五千个。河南省孟津县平乐人民公社供销部最近清理仓库的结果，发现不适合农村销售的商品价值十二万多元。其中包括制电灯泡用的钨丝，大量的电工器材，各种汽车轮胎和钻探机等宝贵物资。又如辽宁省朝阳县最近发动各人民公社、管理区、生产大队群众大搞清理仓库运动，从全县二千一百个仓库中共清理出籽棉、皮棉、芝麻、葵花籽、蓖麻籽、大豆、花生、羊毛、蜂蜜等一百二十多种，价值六十七万元的农副产品。这只不过是几个地区的例子。如果每个人民公社都认真清理一下积压和呆滞在仓库里的物资，肯定会有不少“收获”的。
    人民公社把积压和呆滞的工业器材、原料和其它物资清理出来，调剂有无，支援生产建设需要，不仅对国家有好处，而且首先对人民公社本身有好处。今年农业生产战线任务相当繁重。现在全国各地人民公社正在集中力量大搞农业生产和多种经营，争取秋季大丰收；以便为国家提供更多的商品粮食、副食品和轻工业原料。要更好地发展农业生产和多种经营，除了需要足够的劳动力并加以合理的安排和使用外，也还需要有充足的资金，以购买扩大再生产所需用的各种农业生产资料。这些资金当然主要靠人民公社本身去解决。现在，人民公社把积压、呆滞的器材、原料和其它物资清理出来，调剂有无，或者卖给国家，就可以大大加速公社生产资金的周转，充实和扩大农副业生产资金的来源。这对于争取今年的农业丰收和迅速发展副业生产无疑是一个十分有利的条件。
    有些人民公社的干部和商业人员有这样的想法：清理仓库，把积压和呆滞的物资清理出来，支援城市生产建设需要，这固然是好事情，但总觉得东西还是不如存起来好，什么时候用什么时候去拿，这多方便。这种想法是可以理解的，但是却又是不妥当的。应该看到，把有用的物资长期积压在仓库里，尽管再有用，也是死的东西，人们也不能利用它创造价值。如果现在把积压的物资拿出来，调剂有无，支援城市生产建设需要，就能够迅速变“死物”为“活物”，使它及时充分发挥作用，就可以又快又好地促进生产的发展。再说，保管这些物资还要花费一定的人力和物力，而且有些较贵重的器材和原料如果保管不好，还要遭受损失。如果发生这种情况，对人民公社来说是更不上算的。
    最近，各省、市的工矿企业部门，经过清理仓库，挖掘出大量的市场急需的物资，调剂了有无，取得了很大的成绩。我们相信，人民公社只要认真地重视清理仓库工作，也一定会在较短的时间内做出很好的成绩来。
    清理物资，调剂有无，这是一件并不简单的工作。要做好这一工作，必须在统一领导下进行。县一级党委和有关领导部门应该指定专人负责，帮助人民公社清理物资。一方面要保证把公社积压和呆滞的物资充分调剂出来，或者卖给国家，另一方面也要照顾到公社生产上必需的原材料的合理储备。对于需要原材料的部门，也应当根据需要的程度，区别轻重缓急，进行合理的分配和调剂，从而让这些积压呆滞的器材和物资，顺利投入生产中去。
