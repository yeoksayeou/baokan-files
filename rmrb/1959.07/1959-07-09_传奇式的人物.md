    A Legendary Figure
    Soviet  Bolevoi

    Can people sometimes forget that day, not so long ago! That day, news agencies around the world spread a brief dispatch from occupied Greece to every corner of the globe. A fearless man, whose name was unknown, infiltrated the ancient Acropolis, towering over Athens, in the dead of night. All roads leading to the Acropolis were heavily guarded by SS troops. This man tore down the Nazi flag from the flagpole and raised the white and blue Greek flag.

    This happened in days of human suffering. The radio broadcast frantic shouts, saying that Hitler had begun to establish his Nazi "New Order" in continental Europe, and it would last at least a thousand years. He ordered the swastika, the symbol of the "New Order" feared and cursed by the people, to be raised on the ancient Acropolis of Athens—the cradle of modern European culture. The flag was raised, as the Goebbels newspapers explained, the same flag that had swaggered on the Eiffel Tower in occupied Paris not long ago.

    However, one night in May, this flag disappeared. It vanished before the eyes of the sentries guarding it. The rising sun in the azure Aegean Sea illuminated a Greek flag, the color of the waves, on the flagpole in the morning. In those days, people on five continents knew the name of Glezos, the one who accomplished this feat. He created a miracle akin to the myths of the ancient Greek heroes Homer once sang of. This feat was a symbol of reason overcoming barbarism, and peaceful forces overcoming the forces of war. The dauntless hero of Greece ignited a torch of hope for the people of the occupied countries. The Greek flag fluttering over the ancient Acropolis of Athens instead of the torn-down Nazi flag was like a declaration to the world: Fascism will surely be crushed.

    Humanity has a good memory. Humanity will forever remember the name of one of its glorious sons, of whom people will always be proud.

    What I will never forget is that two elderly stonemasons, while working on repairs at the top of the ancient Acropolis, pointed out to us, Soviet travelers, the place where Glezos performed his heroic deed. Everything remains the same on this ancient hill. A flagpole—a white mast ten meters high—stands on the steep cliff, towering above the abyss. I remember one of us involuntarily exclaiming: How could anyone get up there? Even wild goats can't climb such a precipice.

    "Yes, that's true. But our Manolis Glezos did get up there after all. Love for one's country can give a person the wings of an eagle," the dark-skinned stonemason replied. A sense of pride shone in his words. We understood: Glezos's achievement had echoed like a heroic epic in the noble hearts of his compatriots.

    One year later, one evening when the rocks, scorched by the day, were shrouded in twilight, and the southern full moon coated the marble of this magnificent ruin with a layer of silver, we ascended the ancient Acropolis with a man. This man was of medium height, solidly built, and spoke steadily, with dark eyes set in his contemplative intellectual face. This man was Glezos. Along the way, I told him what I had heard from the stonemasons a year ago. He smiled quietly and said: Yes, the working people of Greece are all romantics, imaginative people. The matter was simpler than that. He did not climb that practically unscalable cliff at all. Since childhood, he had played on the slopes of this hill with barefoot children from the suburbs of Athens. He had long been familiar with a forgotten tunnel. And so, on the night of May 31st, he climbed up through this tunnel. Climbing up was not difficult; what was difficult was avoiding the group of German soldiers guarding the hill, running to the flagpole, lowering the flag, tearing it up, and then raising another Greek flag.

    After listening to his very sincere and simple conversation, I gazed with admiration at this peaceful, calm, and knowledgeable man. And I thought about how fighting fascism for freedom, for the ideals of human light, gives people heroic courage, making them legendary heroes in their own lifetime. I also thought that his brave and warlike people, grateful descendants, may one day erect a monument to this man somewhere in Athens. He made this small country famous throughout the world. His monument will stand alongside the monument to Byron, who sacrificed himself for the freedom of the Greek people…

    But suddenly, a barbaric, foolish, and terrible piece of news arrived: Manolis Glezos had been imprisoned. A secret military tribunal awaits Manolis Glezos. Before this tribunal, he does not have the right to have a defense lawyer appear. The death penalty threatens Manolis Glezos, the glorious Greek patriot. How can one not be indignant and furious at the thought of this? Can one remain indifferent to such an event happening in the second half of the twentieth century?

    Today, on the eighteenth anniversary of the glorious deeds of the great Greek patriot, I, like every Soviet citizen, am willing to add my voice to the call of hundreds of millions of people of goodwill. These people, expressing their belief in the victory of reason and truth in all the languages used by mankind, demand:

    Give freedom to the great Greek patriot!

    Release Manolis Glezos!

    传奇式的人物
    苏联  波列伏依
    难道人们有时候会忘记那个距今已不大近的日子吗！那一天，全世界的通讯社把来自被占领的希腊的一条简讯传播到全球各地。一个不知名姓的混身是胆的人，在深夜潜入了那凛然凌驾于雅典之上的雅典古老城堡。在通往城堡的一切要路，党卫军的部队戒备森严。这个人从旗杆上扯下纳粹的旗子，并升起了白蓝两色的希腊国旗。
    这件事发生在人类蒙受苦难的日子里。无线电里发出疯狂的叫喊，说希特勒开始在欧洲大陆建立自己纳粹的“新秩序”，而且至少也要维持一千年。他命令把那为人民所恐惧和诅咒的“新秩序”的象征卐字旗升上雅典的古老城堡——现代欧洲文化的摇篮。旗子升起了，正如戈培尔报纸所解释的，这就是不久以前在被占领的巴黎的埃菲尔铁塔上耀武扬威的那面旗子。
    可是，就在一个5月的夜里，这面旗子不见了。旗子就在看守旗子的哨兵眼前消失的。早晨在爱琴海蔚蓝色海面上升起的朝阳，照耀着旗杆上一面有如海浪般的颜色的希腊国旗。就在那些日子里，全球五大洲的人们都知道了创立这个功绩的格列索斯的名字。他创造了相当于荷马所曾歌颂过的古希腊英雄的神话般的奇迹。这个功绩是理智战胜野蛮、和平力量战胜战争力量的象征。希腊大无畏的英雄给被占领国家的人民燃起了希望的火炬。希腊国旗代替被扯下的纳粹旗帜在雅典古老城堡上飘扬，就俨如对全世界宣布：法西斯一定被粉碎。
    人类有着良好的记忆力。人类在那些日子里永远怀念着值得人们永远引为自豪的人类光荣的儿子之一的名字。
    我决不会忘记的是，有两位上了年纪的石匠在雅典古老的城堡的顶上作修缮工作的时候，向我们，苏联的旅行者指点出格列索斯建立功勋的地方。在这个古代的丘陵上，一切依然如故。一个旗竿——高达十米的白色桅杆，耸立在峭岩绝壁之上，耸立在深渊的上空。记得我们当中有一个人不由得冲口而出，问道：人怎能上得去呢？甚至野山羊也爬不上去这种悬崖陡壁呀。
    “是的，是这样。但是，我们的曼诺里斯·格列索斯毕竟是上去了。对祖国的爱，可以给人添上一付鹰的翅膀。”面色晒得黑黑的石匠，这样回答我们说。在他的话里，流露出一种自豪的神情。我们明白了：格列索斯的功绩，已经像一部英雄史诗响彻在他同胞的崇高的心房中。
    在一年后的一个傍晚，当白天晒得发烫的岩石已为薄暮笼罩，南国的满月把这片宏伟的废墟的大理石镀上一层银色的时候，我们和一个人登上了雅典古老的城堡。这个人个儿不高，身体结实，谈吐稳健，他那富于沉思的知识分子的脸上生着一对黑眼睛。这个人就是格列索斯。途中，我把一年前从石匠那里听到的话说给他听。他微笑而安静地说：是的，希腊的劳动人民全都是浪漫主义者，富于幻想的人。事情原是比较简单。他根本没有爬上那个实际上不可攀缘的悬崖峭壁。他从小和雅典郊区的一些赤脚的孩子们在这里的小丘的斜坡上玩过。当年，他就熟悉一条被人遗忘的地道。就这样在5月31日晚上，他从这条地道爬了上去。爬上去并不困难，困难的是要躲过守在小丘上的那一群德国大兵，跑到旗杆下，把旗子降下来，扯碎它，再把另一面希腊的旗子升上去。
    我听了他的这番十分真挚纯朴的谈话后，便怀着惊羡的目光注视着这个安祥、沉着和富有学识的人。我并且想到，为争取自由、争取人类光明的理想而同法西斯进行斗争，是怎样地赋予人们以英雄虎胆，使他们在世的时候就成为有口皆碑传奇式的英雄。我还想到他的英勇善战的人民、感戴他的后人，也许总有一天会在雅典的什么地方为这个人树立起一座纪念碑。是他使这个疆域不大的国家扬名于世界。他的纪念碑将和那曾经为争取希腊人民的自由而牺牲的拜伦的纪念碑相并列……
    但是突然传来了一个野蛮的、愚蠢而可怕的消息：曼诺里斯·格列索斯下狱了。秘密的军事法庭在等待着曼诺里斯·格列索斯。在这个法庭前，他没有请辩护人出庭的权利。死刑在威胁着曼诺里斯·格列索斯，这个希腊光荣的爱国者。每思及此，能不激愤和恼怒吗？难道能对二十世纪下半期发生的这种事情无动于衷吗？
    今天，在伟大的希腊爱国者光荣事迹的十八周年纪念日，我正像每个苏联公民一样，愿意把自己的声音加入亿万有善良意志的人们的呼声中。这些以人类所用的各种语言表示相信理智和真理将获胜的人们要求：
    给伟大的希腊爱国者以自由！
    释放曼诺里斯·格列索斯！
