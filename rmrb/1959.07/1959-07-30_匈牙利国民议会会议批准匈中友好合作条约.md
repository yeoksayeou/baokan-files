Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, July 29th: The Hungarian National Assembly meeting opened here on the 29th. The morning session approved the Sino-Hungarian Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, which was signed in Beijing on May 6th of this year.

	Kish Karol, member of the Political Bureau of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Central Committee and Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Assembly, delivered a report at the meeting on the signing of the Sino-Hungarian Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation. He cited facts to illustrate the increasing development of cooperation between Hungary and China in the political, economic, and cultural fields in recent years.

	Kish said that although Hungary and China are far apart, common economic, political, and cultural goals closely link us together. It is natural and necessary for our two countries to establish close cooperation in the political, economic, and cultural fields.

	Kish said that in the ten years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, it has been advancing with giant strides on the road of developing politics, economy, and culture. During the visit of the Hungarian party and government delegation to China, we saw everywhere the Chinese people working hard and selflessly to accelerate socialist construction. The achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party undeniably prove to the world the superiority of the socialist system, and also prove that socialism will inevitably win in the peaceful competition between the two systems.

	After Kish's report, all the deputies unanimously approved the Sino-Hungarian Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, and the entire hall resounded with prolonged and enthusiastic applause.

	Next, Antos István, Minister of Finance of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, reported to the parliament on the implementation of the 1958 national budget.

	Hungarian party and state leaders such as Kádár, Dobi, and Münnich attended the meeting.

    匈牙利国民议会会议批准匈中友好合作条约
    据新华社布达佩斯29日电　匈牙利国民议会会议29日在这里开幕。上午会议批准了匈中友好合作条约，这个条约是今年5月6日在北京签订的。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党中央政治局委员、国民议会外交委员会主席基什·卡罗伊在会上就匈中友好合作条约的签订作了报告。他列举事实说明了近几年来匈中两国在政治、经济、文化方面的合作的日益发展。
    基什说，匈牙利和中国虽然相距很远，但是共同的经济、政治、文化的目标把我们紧密地连结在一起。我们两国在政治、经济和文化方面建立密切的合作是自然和必需的事情。
    基什说，中华人民共和国成立十年来，迈着巨大的步伐，在发展政治、经济和文化的道路上前进着。匈牙利党政代表团访华期间，到处都看到中国人民为加快社会主义建设而辛勤忘我地劳动。中国人民在中国共产党领导下所取得的成就，无可争辩地向全世界证明了社会主义社会的优越性，也证明了社会主义必然会在两个制度的和平竞赛中获得胜利。
    在基什报告后，全体议员一致批准了匈中友好合作条约，全场响起了经久不息的热烈掌声。
    接着，工农革命政府财政部长安托什·伊斯特万向议会报告了1958年度国家预算的执行情况。
    匈牙利党和国家的领导人卡达尔、道比、明尼赫等出席了会议。
