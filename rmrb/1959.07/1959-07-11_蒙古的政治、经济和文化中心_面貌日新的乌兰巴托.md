    Mongolia's Political, Economic, and Cultural Center
    Ulaanbaatar is Rapidly Changing
    Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, will undergo large-scale construction this year, and its appearance is changing with each passing day.
    Before the victory of the Mongolian People's Revolution, Ulaanbaatar had no industry. Now it has developed into Mongolia's industrial center. The country's major factories are concentrated here, including large-scale power, leather, food, and dairy processing plants. Based on the significant achievements of last year, the scale of industrial construction in Ulaanbaatar will be further expanded this year. A flour mill with an annual output of 25,000 tons of flour is under construction and will soon be put into production. Several wool textile factories with an annual output of 700,000 meters of woolen fabrics, a shoe factory with modern machinery and new leather factories are also under construction. The Mongolian Industrial United Factory and the Meat Processing United Factory are also being expanded. The construction and expansion of these factories will greatly increase Mongolia's industrial products.
    Residential buildings and buildings related to the people's cultural welfare undertakings are also gradually increasing in Ulaanbaatar. The Mongolian Youth Palace is nearing completion, and the Post and Telecommunications Building and the International Hotel are under construction. In the south of the city, workers are speeding up construction on a residential construction site of 40,000 square meters, and near this site, residential construction of 50,000 square meters has begun.
    Ulaanbaatar will repair and newly pave asphalt roads with a length of about 30 kilometers and an area of 480,000 square meters this year, and will build new underground heating pipelines with a total length of more than 200 kilometers. In order to complete these projects as soon as possible, employees and citizens throughout the city voluntarily participate in voluntary labor.
    Ulaanbaatar is also the cultural and scientific center of Mongolia. Cultural, educational, and scientific institutions are increasing and expanding year by year. The country's universities are located here, with thousands of university students and more than 20,000 middle school students studying in this city. Schools at all levels implement the teaching policy of combining theory with practice and education with labor production, cultivating new successors for Mongolia's socialist construction.
    Due to the continuous development of Ulaanbaatar's socialist construction, postal, telecommunications, transportation, and social service undertakings are also constantly developing to meet the growing needs of the people.

    蒙古的政治、经济和文化中心
    面貌日新的乌兰巴托
    蒙古首都乌兰巴托今年将进行规模巨大的建设，它的面貌正在日新月异地变化着。
    乌兰巴托在蒙古人民革命胜利前没有工业，现在已经发展成为蒙古的工业中心。全国主要的工厂都集中在这里，其中包括电力、皮革、食品、乳品加工等大工厂。在去年获得显著成就的基础上，乌兰巴托今年的工业建设规模更加扩大，一座年产两万五千吨面粉的面粉厂正在加紧施工，不久将投入生产的几座年产七十万公尺毛织品的毛织厂和有现代化机械设备的制鞋厂和新的皮革工厂也在动工兴建。蒙古工业联合工厂和肉类联合加工厂也在进行扩建。这些工厂的新建和扩建将使蒙古工业产品大大增加。
    乌兰巴托市的住宅建筑和有关人民文化福利事业的建筑也在逐渐增多。蒙古青年宫即将落成，邮电大楼和国际宾馆正在兴建。在市区南边，面积达四万平方公尺的住宅建筑工地上，工人们正在加紧施工，就在这个工地附近，面积达五万平方公尺的住宅又开始动工了。
    乌兰巴托今年将重修和新铺长约三十公里，面积达四十八万平方公尺的柏油马路，将新建总长二百多公里的地下水暖管道。为使这些工程早日完工，全市职工和市民们自愿参加义务劳动。
    乌兰巴托也是蒙古的文化科学中心。文教科学机构逐年增加和扩大，全国的高等学校都设在这里，有数千名大学生和两万多名中学生在这个城市里学习，各级学校贯彻着理论与实际结合、教育与劳动生产相结合的教学方针，为蒙古的社会主义建设事业培养新的接班人。
    由于乌兰巴托社会主义建设事业的不断发展，邮电、交通和社会服务事业也在不断发展，以满足人民日益增长的需要。
