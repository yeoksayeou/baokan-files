The second session of the Seventh National People's Congress is nearing its end. The reporter found a few deputies and asked them: "Before the meeting, did the people ask you to speak, and did you speak out?"

Program Hongsheng, a deputy from Hunan, said: "I have been a deputy for two terms. Comparing this time with the previous ones, I feel that this time is the most straightforward and the most critical in terms of raising issues. It can be said that the people asked us to speak, and we basically spoke out."

Several deputies mentioned that people dared to speak because the democratic atmosphere in the country's political life has strengthened. Also, because there have been mistakes in economic work over the past year, the people have opinions, and they urge the deputies to speak at the meeting. If they don't speak, they won't be able to explain it when they go back. Most of the newly elected deputies lacked experience in politics last time, but this time they have all improved.

Everyone is relatively satisfied with Premier Li Peng's requirement before the meeting that the leaders of various ministries and commissions should not go out and stay to dialogue with the deputies and accept their questions. "This shows that the State Council has the sincerity and courage to listen to the deputies' opinions." Although some departments' performance in the dialogue made the deputies feel unsatisfied, this is the first time the ministers have come to the deputies' groups to accept questions. "With the first time, next time the meeting is held, some departments may have to prepare more seriously."

The reporter saw that in the Liaoning deputies' group, some professors and teachers asked Li Tieming, the Minister of Education, about various problems in the education sector; in the Jiangsu deputies' group, the speakers asked the relevant ministries and commissions to explain one by one how the excessive issuance of currency and the large increase in prices came about; in the Hunan deputies' group, someone asked the supervisory and auditing departments to publish the results of the investigation of the five major companies and inquired about the investigation of the relevant companies' resale of refrigerators in Hunan. This vividly shows that both sides of the dialogue take it as their responsibility to deal with the difficult situation in the future.

Li Yinning, a deputy, said: "This kind of block-to-block dialogue should continue in the future. I suggest that the next meeting increase the vertical dialogue between the central and local governments, so that various ministries and commissions can accept questions from representatives from their respective systems across the country. This way, problems can be more concentratedly reflected and strategies can be discussed."

What are the deputies still concerned about? There is. "The NPC passed the resolution, but can it be well implemented after the meeting? This is what we are most concerned about." Program Daolin and Xue Wenxi, deputies from the industrial base in Yunnan, said: "We grassroots deputies can only form a collective political force at the NPC. When we go back, we can't even supervise the factory director, let alone the government." The deputies generally suggest taking practical measures to strengthen the supervisory role of the NPC institutionally.

### “讲了想讲的话”——部分人大代表谈参加会议感受

　　“讲了想讲的话”
      ——部分人大代表谈参加会议感受
    本报记者  朱维群
    七届人大二次会议临近尾声，记者找了几位代表，问他们：“开会前，群众要你们讲的话，是否都讲出来了？”
    湖南代表程宏盛说：“我当过两届人大代表，比较起来，我感到这次是一些代表最直言不讳、提意见最尖锐的一次。可以说，群众要我们讲的话，基本都讲出来了。”
    几位代表谈到，人们所以敢讲，与国家政治生活中民主空气增强有关，也因为一年来经济工作中有失误，群众有意见，他们催促代表到会上讲。不讲，回去不好交待。上次开会，大多数新当选的代表缺乏议政经验，这次普遍都有了提高。
    大家比较满意的是李鹏总理会前要求各部委领导不得外出，留下来与代表对话、接受质询。“这表现出国务院有听取代表意见的诚意和勇气。”虽然有的部门对话中的表现使代表们感到不尽如意，但这次部长们到代表团接受质询毕竟是第一次。“有了第一次，下次再开会，有些部门恐怕就要认真作准备了。”
    记者看到，在辽宁代表团，一些教授、教师就教育事业中的种种问题向教委主任李铁映当面提问；在江苏代表团，发言者要求有关部委一句对一句地解释货币发行过多、物价涨幅过大是怎么产生的；在湖南代表团，有人要求监察审计部门公布五大公司清查结果，追询有关公司在湖南倒买倒卖电冰箱的清查情况。这生动表现出对话双方都把对付今后艰苦局面当作己任。
    厉以宁代表说：“这种条块对话今后要继续下去，我建议下次会议增加条条的上下对话，让各部委接受来自全国本系统代表们的质询。这样可更集中地反映问题、研讨对策。”
    代表们现在还有什么不放心吗？有。“人大通过了决议，会后能不能得到很好的落实？这是我们最关心的。”来自云南工矿基层的程道林、薛文喜代表说：“我们基层代表只有在人大会上才形成集体议政力量，回去后，不要说监督政府，连厂长都监督不了。”代表们普遍建议采取切实措施，从制度上强化人大监督作用。
