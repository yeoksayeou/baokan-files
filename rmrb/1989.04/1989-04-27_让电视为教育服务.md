Let Television Serve Education
By Zhang Qihua, People's Daily Reporter

Five-year-old Atrian, sitting in front of the television, has learned to recognize characters through watching TV game shows. In France, there are many TV enthusiasts like Atrian. Statistics show that children aged 8 to 16 watch an average of at least two and a half hours of television daily. Society has differing views on the pros and cons of this phenomenon.

Most student parents hold a negative view, fearing that their children's studies will be affected and that their young minds may be corrupted. The saying "television is the opium that poisons children" is a case in point. On the other hand, some people believe that in a modernized society, television is an indispensable tool for students to acquire knowledge and understand the outside world.

The French Ministry of Education cannot ignore this issue, which affects the entire society and the education of a generation. Minister of Education Jospin advocates that schools should pay attention to television and that television should serve education. To this end, the minister consulted experts to discuss how to make television and education work together. A special investigative report has already been made public.

People first point out that the length of time spent watching television is related to the healthy development of young people's minds and bodies, but more importantly, it is the content of the television programs. Compared to some other Western countries, French primary and secondary school students do not watch much television. It is reported that American teenagers spend an average of four and a half hours in front of the television daily. From this perspective, it seems reasonable to ask French television stations to open up more to students. The question is what kind of programs the television stations will provide. If they are obsessed with violence, horror, and pornography, they will naturally corrupt children. If they broadcast rich and varied literature, history, geography, and scientific knowledge, they will certainly be welcomed by parents. Currently, Channel 2 of the state-run television has expressed its willingness to contribute to the dissemination of knowledge.

Jospin advocates that while emphasizing television education, guidance should be strengthened. Based on this policy, the following proposals have been made: First, require television stations (especially state-run stations) to increase the broadcast time of programs for young people on the current basis. Second, amend the current television regulations to allow teachers to legally use relevant television programs in the classroom. Third, mobilize the enthusiasm of school teachers to actively assist the television department in selecting and producing educational programs and closely link them with school teaching. Fourth, not only ensure that students see healthy and beneficial programs during their spare time, but also require the government to install television teaching equipment in schools. It is reported that the Ministry of Education attaches great importance to the above suggestions made by experts and is preparing to negotiate with the television department.

Currently, the debate surrounding youth television education is still ongoing. The Ministry of Education's vision not only needs the support of parents and schools but also the cooperation of society and television professionals. The current difficulty is that some people believe that schools and television are two different functional departments and have no intention of having the television station take on educational tasks. Others believe that setting up a dedicated educational television station will solve everything. Therefore, the government still has a lot of work to do to ultimately realize its plan.

### 让电视为教育服务

　　让电视为教育服务
    本报记者  张启华
    坐在电视机前的阿特里安，今年五岁，他通过收看电视游戏节目，已经学会了认字。在法国，像阿特里安这样的电视迷多得很，据统计，八岁至十六岁的青少年，每天平均至少看两个半小时的电视。对于这种现象的利弊，社会上有不同的看法。
    学生家长普遍持否定的态度，他们担心子女的功课受到影响，更害怕孩子幼小的心灵埋下邪恶的种子，所谓“电视是毒害儿童的鸦片”之说便是一例。与此相反，有人认为在现代化的社会里，电视无疑是学生获得知识，认识外部世界必不可少的工具。
    法国教育部对这个涉及全社会、影响一代人教育的问题不能不加过问。教育部长若斯潘主张：学校应该重视电视，电视要为教育服务。为此，部长先生请教了有关专家，探讨如何做到使电视与教育这两个部门进行合作。目前，一个专题调查报告已经向外界公开了。
    人们首先指出，青少年身心健康的发展，与看电视时间的长短不无关系，但更主要的是电视的内容。同其它一些西方国家比较，法国中小学生看电视的时间还不算多。据介绍，美国青少年每天在电视机前的时间平均为四个半小时。从这方面说，要求法国电视台进一步向学生们开放似有道理。问题是电视台提供什么样的节目，如果热衷于暴力、恐怖、色情，自然是对儿童的腐蚀，而如果播放的是丰富多采的文学、历史、地理和科技常识，当然会受到广大家长们的欢迎。目前，国营电视二台已表示，他们愿意为传播知识做出自己的努力。
    若斯潘主张，重视电视教育的同时要加强指导。根据这项方针，人们提出如下提议：一、要求电视台（特别是国营台）在现有的基础上，增加有关青少年节目的播放时间。二、修改现行的电视法规，允许教师合法地在课堂上录用电视的有关节目。三、调动学校教师的积极性，使他们主动协助电视部门编选、制作教育节目，并与学校的教学紧密联系起来。四、不仅保证学生在课余时间看到健康有益的节目，还要求政府在学校增设电视教学设备。据报道，教育部很重视上述专家提出的建议，准备同电视部门进行谈判。
    当前，围绕青少年电视教育问题的辩论还在进行。教育部的设想不仅需要家长和学校的支持，更需要社会、电视专业部门的配合。目前的困难是有人认为，学校与电视是两个不同的职能部门，无意由电视台承担教育任务。有人则认为只要增设一个专门的教育电视台就一切了结。因此，政府要最终实现它的方案，还要做出很大的努力。
