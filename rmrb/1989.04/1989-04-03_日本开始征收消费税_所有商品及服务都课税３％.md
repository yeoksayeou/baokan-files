Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 1st

Japan started implementing its consumption tax system today.

This tax system stipulates that, with the exception of capital and financial transactions, medical care, welfare, and certain schools, all goods and services will be subject to a 3% direct consumption tax starting today.

This is part of the fundamental tax reform that the Japanese government carried out last year. Through this tax reform, income tax, corporate tax, and inheritance tax have been reduced, the indirect goods tax has been abolished, and this direct consumption tax system has been implemented.

Japanese Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru and all members of the Japanese cabinet went to various locations in Tokyo, including department stores, supermarkets, and agricultural product wholesale markets, to inspect the implementation of the consumption tax system. Takeshita purchased a French tie priced at 15,000 yen at the famous Mitsukoshi department store and also paid the 3% consumption tax.

The Japan Fair Trade Commission, to prevent unscrupulous merchants from taking advantage of the situation to raise prices, stated that it will severely punish those who engage in illegal price hikes.

The Economic Planning Agency also set up a special hotline to monitor price movements.

Leaders of opposition parties held speeches in various parts of Tokyo today, criticizing the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet for implementing the consumption tax system and calling on consumers to unite and force the government to abolish this tax system.

However, overall, except for some confusion in certain areas, the market situation on the first day of the implementation of the consumption tax system was stable.

　　日本开始征收消费税
    所有商品及服务都课税３％
    新华社东京４月１日电  （记者张可喜）日本从今天起开始实行消费税制度。
    这项税制规定，除资本和金融交易、医疗、福利和部分学校外，所有的商品和服务从今天开始都将课以３％的直接消费税。
    这是日本政府去年进行的根本性税制改革的一部分。通过这次税制改革，减少了收入税、法人税和遗产继承税，废除了间接的物品税，实行了这一直接的消费税制度。
    日本首相竹下登及日本内阁全体成员今天一早就分头到东京都内大百货店、超级市场和农产品批发市场视察消费税制度的执行情况。竹下在日本著名的百货店——三越本店购买了一条价格为１．５万日元的法国领带，还付了３％的消费税。
    日本公正交易委员会为防止不法商人乘机哄抬物价，表示要对违法提价者严加惩处。
    经济企划厅也为监视物价动向，设立了物价专用电话。
    在野党各党领袖今天分别在东京都内闹市举行讲演会，批评自民党内阁实行消费税制，要求消费者团结起来，迫使政府废除这一税制。
    但是，总的看来，除部分地区发生混乱外，消费税制实施第一天的市场情况平稳。
