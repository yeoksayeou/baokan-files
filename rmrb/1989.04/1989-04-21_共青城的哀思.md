The sorrow of the young pioneers' hearts is shattered by the passing of Comrade Hu Yaobang!

On the 15th of April, the day Comrade Hu Yaobang passed away, coincidentally, the Jiangxi Province Young Pioneers Reclamation Farm and the State Council's directly affiliated enterprise, China Rural Trust and Investment Corporation, jointly held a founding ceremony for the "China Yaya (Group) Company." This new organizational form aims to explore the second phase of rural reform.

The grim news was transmitted via the television microwave on the hills of Gongqing City, reaching them at seven in the evening. The joyous atmosphere of the founding ceremony was instantly replaced by a cloud of sorrow. Some put down their wine glasses to stand in silent tribute, while others couldn't help but cover their faces and weep. The fireworks planned for the ceremony were canceled, as was the scheduled dance party. People spontaneously made wreaths to express their grief from afar, and representatives preparing to go to Beijing to pay their respects began to pack their bags...

Despite this, the young pioneers still couldn't accept this reality. Deng Gang, the assistant to the board of directors of the Yaya Group, had visited Comrade Hu Yaobang's home just ten days prior. He was fine then, so how could he suddenly pass away? "No, he hasn't died!" The scenes of being with Comrade Hu Yaobang were still vivid in their minds.

On that day, Deng Gang brought the good news of the formation of the Yaya Group, composed of the young pioneers and "China Rural Trust and Investment Corporation," to Comrade Hu Yaobang's home. In the study room surrounded by bookshelves, Comrade Hu Yaobang sat cross-legged on the sofa, with an open book in front of him. Seeing Deng Gang enter, Comrade Hu Yaobang warmly greeted him to sit down and listened intently and excitedly as he introduced the process of forming this new type of rural enterprise group. Comrade Hu Yaobang wished the group success but politely declined the request to name the group, saying it would be inappropriate for him to do so again. Little did he know that his conversation with Deng Gang would be his last care for the young pioneers.

At the Young Pioneers Reclamation Farm, Party Committee Secretary Yu Weizhong is the only member of the leadership team who is a first-generation young pioneer. Comrade Hu Yaobang's passing brought back memories of the past for him.

Thirty-four years ago, 98 Shanghai youth responded to the call and came to this desolate area by the Poyang Lake. In less than 40 days, Comrade Hu Yaobang rushed to visit them. He lived in a thatched hut with the youth, ate thin porridge and pickled radishes, and had heart-to-heart talks with them. He also wrote words of encouragement in Yu Weizhong's notebook and named the place "Young Pioneers Community." Later, whenever a new stage of development was reached, Comrade Hu Yaobang would name the place again: "Young Pioneers Reclamation Farm," "Gongqing City."

Comrade Hu Yaobang's last visit to the Young Pioneers Reclamation Farm was in 1984, coinciding with the 30th anniversary of the young pioneers taking root. Facing the new city that had risen from the barren hills by the lake, Comrade Hu Yaobang was very excited. He picked up the notebook with the words he had written for Yu Weizhong and sighed, "Today is December 12th. Historically, Zhang Xueliang was a man of ambition but his plans did not succeed. Now it's different; you are men of ambition who have succeeded." With that, he wrote down "Men of ambition succeed" for the young pioneers.

At this point, Yu Weizhong specially explained: "Comrade Hu Yaobang's care for the young pioneers is a fact, but he did not give us special material or financial support as some people might imagine. Over the more than 30 years of building the farm, apart from receiving over 200,000 yuan in relief from the state due to floods and typhoon disasters, we have not taken a single penny from the state. Instead, we started from scratch and built the Gongqing City enterprise worth over 200 million yuan."

It was during that same visit that Comrade Hu Yaobang went to the down jacket factory for an inspection. Qin Yuchang, who was then the workshop director, still remembers Comrade Hu Yaobang shaking hands with the young cadres one by one. Upon hearing that the down jacket factory had become the number one producer of over 3 million down products annually, with down products, roasted ducks, and lean meat pigs selling in over 30 countries and regions, and earning over 20 million US dollars in foreign exchange, Comrade Hu Yaobang was very pleased and praised them as the "new generation of the 1980s."

In these sorrowful days, the new generation of young pioneers did not disappoint Comrade Hu Yaobang's deep affection and expectations. They turned their sorrow into strength, steadfastly guarded their production posts, and used practical actions to commemorate the person they respected the most in their hearts.

　　共青城的哀思
    本报记者  魏亚南
    耀邦同志就这么走了，使共青人的心碎了！
    四月十五日，耀邦同志逝世的当天，正赶上江西省共青垦殖场与国务院直属企业中国农村信托投资公司联合组建的“中国鸭鸭（集团）公司”举行成立大会，以新的组织形式探索农村的第二步改革。
    噩耗通过共青城山岗上接收的电视微波传来，已是晚上七点钟了，白天集团成立的喜庆气氛顿时被悲痛的阴云取代。有的放下手中的酒杯起立默哀，有的禁不住掩面流泪。成立大会原定施放的焰火熄灭了，安排好的舞会取消了，人们自发地扎花圈遥致哀思，前往北京吊唁的代表准备打点上路……
    尽管如此，共青人还是不愿接受这个事实。鸭鸭集团的董事助理邓钢十天前曾去耀邦同志家，他还好好的呐，怎么就这么突然离去呢？“不，他没有死！”与耀邦同志在一起的情景分明就在眼前。
    那天，邓钢带着共青人与“中农信”组成鸭鸭集团的喜讯来到耀邦同志家。在以书橱为四壁的书房里，耀邦同志盘腿端坐在沙发上，眼前放着一本打开的书。看到邓钢进来，耀邦同志亲切地招呼小邓坐下，听他介绍鸭鸭集团这一新型农村企业集团形成的经过，那么专心，那么兴奋。耀邦同志预祝集团办得成功，却婉言谢绝了为集团题名的请求，说是再由他题名不合适了。没料到他同邓钢的谈话，竟成了对共青人的最后关怀。
    共青垦殖场党委书记于维忠是领导班子中唯一的第一代共青人，耀邦同志的去世勾起了他对往事的回忆。
    三十四年前，九十八名上海知识青年响应号召，来到这荒无人烟的鄱阳湖畔不到四十天，耀邦同志就赶来看望大家。他与青年们住茅草棚，喝稀粥，吃萝卜干，促膝谈心，还在于维忠的笔记本上题词勉励，并将这里题名为“共青社”。以后，每当发展到一个新阶段，耀邦同志就为这里题一次名：“共青垦殖场”、“共青城”。
    耀邦同志最后一次来共青垦殖场是一九八四年，适逢共青人扎根三十周年纪念。面对当年湖滨荒丘上崛起的一座新城，耀邦同志很兴奋。他拿起当年为于维忠题词的笔记本，不胜感慨地说：“今天是十二月十二日，历史上西安事变张学良是有志者事不成。如今不同了，你们是有志者事竟成。”说罢，挥笔为共青人写下了“有志者事竟成”六个字。
    讲到这里，于维忠特别说明：“耀邦同志关怀共青人是事实，但他并没像有些人想象的那样，给我们以物资或资金的特别照顾。建场三十多年来，除了因为遭受洪水和台风灾害，得到国家二十多万元救济之外，我们没有拿过国家一分钱，相反，却白手起家创下了共青城这个两亿多元的家业。”
    还是那一次，耀邦同志来到羽绒厂参观。当时担任车间主任的秦裕昌至今还记得耀邦同志与青年干部一一握手的情景。听说羽绒厂已成为年产三百多万件羽绒制品的头号大厂，羽绒制品、板鸭、瘦肉型猪等畅销三十多个国家和地区，年创汇二千多万美元时，耀邦同志非常高兴，称赞他们不愧为“八十年代的新一辈”。
    在悲痛的日子里，新一代的共青人没有辜负耀邦同志的深情厚望，他们化悲痛为力量，坚守生产岗位，以实际行动缅怀心目中最敬爱的人。
