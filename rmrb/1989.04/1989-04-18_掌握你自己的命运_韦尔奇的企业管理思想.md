Jack Welch is the chairman of the General Electric Company in the United States. He is widely regarded as one of the toughest business executives in the world, earning the nickname "Neutron Jack." His management philosophy can be summarized in six principles:

1. Face reality, do not dwell on the past or indulge in fantasies.
2. Be honest with everyone.
3. Do not "manage," but "lead."
4. Initiate change before it becomes necessary.
5. Do not compete if you do not have a favorable position.
6. Take control of your own destiny, otherwise, you will be controlled by others.

Facing reality often means that leaders have to make painful decisions. When Welch first became the company's chairman, General Electric was bloated and inefficient. Welch believed that mediocrity is the first symptom of decline. He reduced the workforce by 100,000 employees, a quarter of the company's total, through layoffs, restructuring, and divestitures, which naturally drew resentment. However, he believed that bureaucracy is a sin because it distracts people from important matters, reduces productivity, and makes it impossible to compete effectively. He organized managers and employees to seriously discuss and eliminate unnecessary meetings, reports, requests, and other cumbersome procedures. The company's finance department used to have about a thousand people working overtime or late at night at the end of each quarter to make General Electric the first major company in the United States to report its financial status to the public. But Welch said, "Save your energy! Who cares if you report first?"

Being honest with everyone helps employees understand your thoughts. Welch tried to communicate directly with employees as often as possible. He met with thousands of people each year, including everyone who was demoted or promoted to a managerial position. After the company was streamlined, many people still could not get rid of the old ways of doing things. Welch told these people, "If someone tells me they work 90 hours a week, I will say, you are completely wrong. I go skiing on the weekends and meet with friends on Fridays. You should do the same, otherwise, you are making a bad deal. Look at the 20 things you do in 90 hours, at least 10 of them are useless or can be done by others."

Welch believes that "leadership" is different from "management." A leader needs courage, a strong will, and a clear mind. His job is to use the existing human and financial resources most effectively, not to distribute them evenly like spreading butter on bread. In today's fiercely competitive global market, Welch emphasizes the importance of efficiency for competition. "Delaying a correct decision is as bad as making a wrong decision." Business leaders must make decisions promptly and not procrastinate.

Welch believes that all management ideas and practices serve one purpose: to take control of your own destiny. To control your own destiny in a rapidly changing global market, you must improve labor productivity. The higher the productivity, the more capable you are of lowering prices to capture the global market. Welch believes that the key to increasing productivity is to "liberate" middle managers and give them more authority. He said, "The most valuable thing about people is self-confidence. We must try to get rid of the whip, chains, and nagging, give people self-confidence, and let them take on more responsibility." "Loosen the employees' hands and boldly give them authority, not as a favor, but as a necessity for competition."

Welch believes that a company should have its own development strategy, but this strategy is not a fixed long-term action plan. Instead, it evolves and extends with the changing environment. The central idea is to take control of your own destiny.

### 掌握你自己的命运——韦尔奇的企业管理思想

　　掌握你自己的命运
　  ——韦尔奇的企业管理思想
    杰克·韦尔奇是美国通用电器公司的董事长，被广泛地认为是世界上最不讲情面的经营者之一，绰号“中子杰克”。他的管理思想概括起来有以下六条原则：
    一、面对现实，不要忆旧或想入非非；
    二、对每个人都坦诚相告；
    三、不要“管理”，要“领导”；
    四、在不得不改变之前率先变革；
    五、如果没有参与竞争的有利条件，不要去竞争；
    六、掌握你自己的命运，否则将受别人摆布。
    面对现实意味着领导者常常不得不做出痛苦的决定。韦尔奇刚刚任公司董事长时，通用电器公司机构臃肿庞大，调度不灵。韦尔奇认为，平庸是衰退的第一大症状。他通过解雇、整顿和变卖等办法减少了十万名雇员，相当于公司总人数的四分之一，且因此招来怨恨。但他认为，官僚体制是一种罪恶，因为它分散人们对重要事务的注意力而降低生产率，无法与对手进行有力的竞争。他组织各级经理与雇员们一起认真论证，取消了不必要的会议、报告、请示及其它烦琐程序。该公司财务部门原来每季度末总有大约一千人在周末加班或工作到深夜，以使该公司成为美国向公众报告收支状况的第一家大公司。但是韦尔奇说：“节省你们的精力吧！谁在乎你第一个报告呢！”
    坦诚相告能使雇员清楚地了解你的思想。韦尔奇尽可能经常与雇员们面对面直接交谈。他一年接待上千人次，包括每一个被解除或提拔为经理的人。公司精简后，很多人仍摆脱不开旧的办事程序。韦尔奇对这些人说：“如果有人告诉我说他一周工作九十小时，我会说，你大错特错了。我周末要去滑雪，星期五要与朋友们一道聚会。你也应这样做，否则就是做了笔亏本买卖。把你在九十个小时内所干的二十件工作拿来看看，起码有十件是无用的，或是其他人可以为你干。”
    韦尔奇认为“领导”不同于“管理”。一个领导者需要勇气、坚强的意志和清醒的头脑。他的工作是把现有的人力、财力最有效地运用起来，而不能像在面包上抹黄油那样平均分配。在世界市场竞争激烈的今天，韦尔奇强调高效率对竞争十分重要，“迟迟做出一个正确决定与做出一个错误决定结果一样。”企业领导人处理事务要当机立断，不能拖拖拉拉。
    韦尔奇认为，所有的管理思想与作法都是为了一个目的：掌握你自己的命运。欲在变化莫测的世界市场掌握住自己的命运，就要提高劳动生产率水平。生产率越高，就越有能力降低价格去占领世界市场。韦尔奇认为生产率增长的关键在于“解放”中层管理人员，更多地授权给他们。他说：“人最宝贵的价值是自信。我们要努力甩开鞭子、锁链和唠唠叨叨，给人们以自信，使他们承担更多的责任。”“放开雇员的手脚，大胆向他们授权，不是恩赐，而是竞争的需要。”
    韦尔奇认为，一个公司应有自己的发展战略，但这种战略不是一种固定的长期行动计划，而是随着环境的变化，不断演进和延伸。最中心的思想就是掌握住你自己的命运。
