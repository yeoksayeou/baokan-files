Author: Bai Fengge

Edition: 7

An Italian author's book filled with affection for China, titled "Love for China," has been a bestseller in Italy for years, reprinted multiple times. The author is Ilario Fiori, a renowned Italian writer and radio and television correspondent stationed in China.

"Love for China" compiles 30 articles written by the author between 1980 and 1984 about China. The book is divided into two parts. The first part includes the first four articles: "My Longing," "My 'Chinese' Mother," "Home in Beijing," and "Three Sundays." These articles vividly express the author's lifelong admiration for China and his eventual realization of his dream, as well as his experiences of bringing his family to China to work and live. Notably, the article "Home in Beijing" won the "Beijing Daily" and "Weili Cup" award for foreign writers' views on Beijing. The remaining 11 articles, such as "Deng Xiaoping's Long March" and "Jiang Qing's Political Revenge," are interviews with over a dozen prominent figures from China's contemporary political, health, and cultural sectors, detailing their biographies and lesser-known anecdotes. The second part includes 15 articles like "Old Beijing" and "The Eastern Gate of the Capital," offering a nostalgic look at the cultural history of 14 ancient Chinese cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, and Nanjing.

"Love for China" has been very popular in Italy and has been reprinted multiple times. An article in the Italian "Times" praised the book, stating: "Today, amidst the China fever in Italy, the publication of 'Love for China' meets the needs of the times. This book, written by an author who has lived and worked in China for many years with a deep affection for the country, is a result of meticulous reporting, careful observation, and thoughtful comparison. It is a vivid portrait painted with words, a persuasive comparative chart, though not filled with dry numbers, but drawn from the author's years of experience, especially in comparison with the realities of the United States and the Soviet Union."

The author participated in the anti-fascist guerrilla movement during World War II and began his journalism career. After the war, he studied at the University of Turin. Since 1950, he has been a foreign correspondent. He has witnessed many major political events in the world since World War II, including the Algerian War of Independence, the Hungarian incident, the assassination of U.S. President Kennedy, the fall of Soviet leader Khrushchev, and China's political trial of the "Gang of Four."

The author is also a prolific writer, with notable works including "The Last Train to Budapest," "Iron-Fisted Figure Beria," and "Shanghai Express." Many of his works have been translated into English, German, French, and Chinese, such as "The Caviar of the Volga and the Spies of the Kremlin," which was translated into Chinese as "The Mysterious Figure Louis." He has also produced 50 television documentaries, earning him the title of "a flower on the Italian television screen" from Italian television viewers.

The Italian government has twice awarded him the Knight of the Republic medal in recognition of his outstanding work.

The author proudly states: "I am in the process of recognizing, understanding, learning, narrating, describing, and filming the history of a great nation, one of the oldest in the annals of world civilization, which is now at an extraordinary moment in its quest for progress and peace for the world." For many years, Fiori has diligently and objectively introduced China's development to his home country and the world. His reports have been praised by Chinese leaders and relevant departments.

　　一个意大利人眼中的中国
　  ——伊拉里奥·菲奥雷和他的《相思情》
　　白凤阁
    一本饱含对中国友好之情、名为《相思情》的书，连年风靡意大利，成为再版多次的畅销书。作者是意大利名作家、驻华广播电视记者伊拉里奥·菲奥雷。
    《相思情》汇集作者１９８０年至１９８４年期间写的对中国的报道共３０篇文章，分两部分。第一部分前４篇《我的夙愿》、《我的“中国”妈妈》、《北京的家》和《三个礼拜天》是点题，从字里行间生动地抒写出作者从小就向往中国和后来终于实现理想的激情以及他携家属来华工作和生活的情况。其中《北京的家》一文还获得《北京日报》《威力杯外国人看北京》征文奖。其余的《邓小平的长征》、《江青的政治报复》等十一篇是作者对中国当代政界、卫生和文化艺术界十几位知名人物的采访记，写出了他们的传记或鲜为人知的轶事。第二部分有《昔日的北京》、《首都的东大门》等１５篇是作者怀着相思之情对北京、天津、南京等１４座中国古老城市的文化历史的介绍和回顾。
    《相思情》在意大利很畅销，已再版多次。意大利《时代报》发表的书评说：“今天，在意大利出现的中国热中，《相思情》的出版符合时代的要求，这是作者怀着对中国爱慕之情，在华生活和工作多年，认真采访，细心观察，思索和比较写出的文学报道，是用文字绘出一幅有血有肉、栩栩如生的写生画，又是一张富于说服力的比较表，不过这张表不是用枯涩的数字填写的，是凭作者多年积累的经验，尤其是同美国和苏联的现实相比较后绘制出的杰作。”
    作者在第二次世界大战时参加反法西斯游击队并开始了记者生涯，战后进都灵大学深造，从１９５０年起至今长期担任驻外记者。他目睹了二次世界大战以来世界许多重大政治事件：阿尔及利亚的独立战争、匈牙利事件、美国肯尼迪遇刺、苏联赫鲁晓夫下台以及中国对“四人帮”的审判政治案等。
    作者也是一位多产作家，代表作有《开往布达佩斯的最后列车》、《铁腕人物贝利亚》和《上海特快列车》等，其中许多作品被译成英文、西文、法文和中文，如《伏尔加河的鱼子酱，克里姆林宫的间谍》一书，中文版书名为《神密人物路易斯》。他还摄制了５０部电视专题片，被意大利电视观众称为“意大利电视屏幕上的一枝花。”
    意大利政府为表彰他的出色工作，先后两次授予他共和国骑士勋章。
    作者自豪地说：“我正在认识、了解、学习、讲述、描写和拍摄一个伟大国家的历史，这个国家是世界文明史中最古老的国家之一，今日正处于她为世界求得进步与和平的进程中的一个不寻常的时刻。”菲奥雷多年来认真和客观地向其本国和外部世界介绍中国的发展情况。他的报道曾受到我领导人和有关单位的表扬。（附图片）
