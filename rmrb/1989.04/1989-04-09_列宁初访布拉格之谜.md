In the study of Lenin's revolutionary activities, there has been a mystery unsolved for decades: when did he first visit Prague and for what purpose?

As early as the late 1920s, the Soviet Union planned to publish a collection of Lenin's letters to his relatives from 1894 to 1919. The publishers believed that in the summer of 1900, while in exile abroad, Lenin had first stopped in Prague. A Czech Social Democratic Party member, F. Modrachek, who had seen Lenin at the time, recalled that Lenin had indeed visited him. However, this claim lacked evidence for a long time.

It was not until the end of 1987 that Lenin's first letter to Modrachek, written in 1900, was discovered in the archives of the Lenin Museum in Moscow, using a Munich address for communication. The truth finally came to light. It turned out that in March 1900, after spending three years in exile, Lenin returned from Siberia. On July 29, he left Russia and arrived in Prague two or three days later. Introduced by the editor-in-chief of the Czech Social Democratic Party's organ, the *People's Rights Newspaper*, A. Nemec, Lenin met Modrachek and asked him to help forward letters to his family. Modrachek agreed without hesitation.

After Lenin went to Switzerland, he discussed the establishment of the *Iskra* newspaper with the Labor Emancipation group led by Plekhanov. In early September, he moved to Munich to stay, and immediately informed Modrachek of his communication address and pseudonym, Mayer. This is the situation surrounding Lenin's first visit to Prague and the events before and after.

The tsarist authorities checked all letters coming from abroad, and if they found anything suspicious, they would confiscate them. In light of this, Lenin communicated with his family in Russia using a special method. In letters to his mother or sister, he instructed that replies be sent to Modrachek for forwarding to Vladimir Ilyich. Lenin's letters to his family were addressed to a Moscow address, placed inside a larger envelope, and then sent to Modrachek's address. Upon receiving it, Modrachek would open the larger envelope, take out the letter, and mail it. Replies from Lenin's mother or sister were also sent to Prague, received by Modrachek, and then enclosed in a larger envelope and sent to Karl Lehmann in Munich for forwarding to Mayer. Lehmann was a German doctor who not only helped Lenin forward letters but also assisted in publishing the *Iskra* newspaper.

　　列宁初访布拉格之谜
    黄英尚
    在列宁革命活动的研究中，有一个数十年未解之谜。那就是他初访布拉格在何时？目的何在？
    早在２０年代末，苏联就拟出版列宁１８９４—１９１９年致亲属书信集。出版者认为，列宁１９００年夏在流亡国外途中，曾首次在布拉格停留。当年见过列宁的捷克社会民主党人弗·莫德拉切克回忆说，列宁那时确曾登门访问过他。可是，这一说法一直缺乏证据。
    直到１９８７年底，在莫斯科列宁博物馆的档案中，发现列宁１９００年写给莫氏的第一封信，他使用了慕尼黑的通讯地址，真相才大白。原来１９００年３月，列宁在度过了三年流放生活之后，从西伯利亚归来。７月２９日他离开俄国，两三天后抵达布拉格。经捷克社会民主党机关报《人民权利报》总编安·涅麦茨介绍，列宁结识了莫氏，并请莫氏帮助接转与家人的信件，莫氏一口答应。
    列宁赴瑞士后，同普列汉诺夫的劳动解放社商谈创办《火星报》事。９月初他到慕尼黑长住，随即把自己的通讯地址及化名迈尔函告莫氏。这就是列宁初访布拉格及其前后的情况。
    沙俄当局对来自国外的一切信件都进行检查，发现有可疑之处就加以没收。有鉴于此，列宁同国内通讯是以特殊的方法进行的。在给他母亲或妹妹的信中，告复信寄莫德拉切克转符（拉基米尔）·伊（里奇）收。列宁寄给家人的信封写上莫斯科地址，将其装入大信封，再写上莫氏住址，然后发出。莫氏收到后，把大信封拆开，取出信件，投入邮箱。列宁母亲或妹妹的复信也寄往布拉格，由莫氏收讫，再裹以大信封，寄慕尼黑卡·莱曼转迈尔收。莱曼是位德国医生，他不仅为列宁收转信件，还帮他出版《火星报》。
