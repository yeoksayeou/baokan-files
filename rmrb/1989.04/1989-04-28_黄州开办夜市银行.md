    Since late April, a night market bank has appeared in Huangzhou Town, Huanggang County, Hubei, and has been warmly welcomed by local residents.

    After the nationwide implementation of daylight saving time on April 16, workers' commuting times were adjusted, affecting their ability to visit banks during regular hours. Additionally, some individual business owners handle large amounts of cash and operate late into the night. The Huangzhou branch of the Bank of China has responded to this situation by extending its operating hours, starting from 7 AM and closing at 9:30 PM. The bank has also assigned dedicated staff to pick up and deliver cash for individual business owners. In the first five days of operation, the night market bank attracted 200,000 yuan in deposits.

　　黄州开办夜市银行
    本报讯  ４月下旬以来，湖北黄冈县黄州镇出现一家夜市银行，受到市民欢迎。
    ４月１６日全国实行夏时制后，职工上下班时间提前，进银行的时间受到影响；有的个体户现金较多，营业到很晚。中国银行黄州支行针对这个情况，决定延长营业时间，从每天早上７点开始一直到晚上９点半钟，还抽出专人去个体户那里接送现金。夜市银行开办前５天，就吸收存款２万元。（童万平）
