Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 8th.

The spokesperson for the Energy Department stated today that the Energy Department has not considered the issue of expanding the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station.

In recent days, Hong Kong newspapers have published reports stating that a second nuclear power station will be built in Daya Bay, Guangdong. The spokesperson commented on these reports.

The spokesperson said that in the second half of last year, the Energy Department organized a study on China's energy development strategy up to the year 2000. In the energy development plan for China up to the year 2000, there is no consideration of building a second nuclear power station in Daya Bay or expanding the nuclear power station currently under construction.

The spokesperson said that the reports in Hong Kong newspapers are the personal opinions of experts. The Energy Department has not yet received an application from the relevant departments in Guangdong Province to build a new nuclear power station. Therefore, the question of how to build it does not arise.

Recently, there have been rumors that certain places have been negotiating with foreign entities to introduce nuclear power stations. The spokesperson addressed this issue, saying that all energy negotiations with foreign entities must go through the Energy Department.

　　能源部新闻发言人指出
    大亚湾核电站没有考虑扩建
    本报北京４月８日讯  记者陈祖甲报道：能源部新闻发言人今天说，能源部没有考虑大亚湾核电站的扩建问题。
    近些天来，香港报纸纷纷发表报道，说是要在广东大亚湾建设第二座核电站。发言人针对这些消息，发表了意见。
    发言人说，去年下半年，能源部组织了我国能源到２０００年发展战略研究。在我国到２０００年的能源发展规划中，也没有考虑在大亚湾建设第二座核电站或对正在建设的核电站进行扩建的问题。
    发言人说，香港报纸报道的是专家个人的意见。能源部至今未接到广东省有关部门提出的建设新的核电站的立项申请。因而，也谈不到如何建设问题。
    近来有传言，某些地方对外洽谈引进核电站，发言人针对这个问题说，各地对外的能源谈判都要经过能源部。
