Currently, waves of migrant workers are surging towards the Northwest.

On April 1, the plaza of Lanzhou Railway Station was overwhelmed by a sea of people. Everywhere, there were weary, soot-stained faces, bodies lying on the ground, and filthy luggage.

All westbound trains at the station were affected. Often, many people would rush onto the trains, only to be pushed off; they would try again, only to be pushed off again. Besides the train staff, passengers inside the trains also joined in the "defense of the trains." At 11:30 AM, the 143rd train from Xi'an to Urumqi arrived at Lanzhou Station. All the doors could not be opened, and every corner of the carriages was packed with people.

Lanzhou Station is a key hub for travel from inland areas to the Northwest. Deputy Station Master Gao Weiguo said, "This chaotic situation has been going on for two weeks and is getting worse." On April 1, the number of people stranded at Lanzhou Railway Station plaza reached more than 6,000.

It is understood that 70% of the migrant workers come from Sichuan. In addition, there are farmers from Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. Almost all of them are heading to Xinjiang, and almost all of them are going to sell their labor, without a specific destination.

　　民工潮涌到西北  兰州站人满为患
    本报兰州４月３日电  记者张述圣、阎晓明、孙健报道：目前，一支支民工大军正在向大西北涌动。
    ４月１日，兰州车站广场被云集的人流吞没。到处是污黑、疲倦的面容，席地而卧的躯体和肮脏的行李。
    站台上所有西去的列车都受到冲击。常常是，许多人冲上去，被推下来；再上去，再被推下来。除了列车员外，车上的乘客也参加了“保卫列车”的“战斗”。上午１１时３０分，西安开往乌鲁木齐的１４３次列车驶入兰州站，所有车门无法打开，车厢内每个角落都塞满了人。
    兰州站是内地通往西北的枢纽。副站长高卫国说：“这种混乱的情景已持续两个星期了，而且越来越严重。”４月１日，滞留在兰州车站广场的人数已达６０００多人。
    据了解，民工中７０％的人来自四川。此外，还有河南、山东、江浙等地的农民。几乎所有的人都是去新疆的，也几乎所有的人都是出卖体力去的，而且无目的地。
