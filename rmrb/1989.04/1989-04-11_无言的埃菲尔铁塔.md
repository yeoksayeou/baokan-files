This year marks the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. Two hundred years ago, a powerful new social force—the bourgeoisie—was born. The bourgeoisie was the true victor of the French Revolution. This was not only a political revolution but also an industrial revolution. The bourgeoisie emerged and grew with the progress of the industrial revolution. To celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French bourgeois revolution of 1789, the French government decided to hold a World Exposition and build a permanent memorial, which is the background to the birth of the Eiffel Tower.

Over the past 100 years, the Eiffel Tower has welcomed kings and heads of state from all European countries and from all continents. Now, it attracts approximately 20 to 30 million tourists from around the world each year. In recent years, the French government has spent $30 million to renovate and reinforce the tower. For example, the heavy concrete floor has been replaced with a steel floor, the old and slow hydraulic elevators have been replaced with high-speed double-deck elevators that can transport 10,000 people a day, and some rusted parts have been replaced. The third floor has also been equipped with glass windows and other safety devices.

The significance of the Eiffel Tower's construction lies in the fact that it is not an isolated phenomenon. It resonated with the success of the industrial revolution in Europe at that time, the rapid increase in urban population, the exponential growth in the number of cities and towns, the emergence of a new urbanized society, and the urgent need for transportation and new buildings. Architects eager to keep up with the times were desperately seeking a new architectural style that could reflect the changing times. The historical mission of breaking free from the constraints of old architectural art concepts and finding new architectural art forms and languages was first accomplished by great engineers and surveyors. Gustave Eiffel was the most outstanding representative among them. The Eiffel Tower he designed is a milestone of this new architectural art concept. Bridges, roads, canals, churches, and dockyards completed at the same time or later also played a role in challenging old ideas. Therefore, whether in terms of achievements or the creators themselves, they can all be considered "Eiffel's brothers."

The Eiffel Tower has been standing for 100 years. From its inception, recognition, to today when people still commemorate it, we can draw many inspirations. The birth of a style is not something that can be arbitrarily created by any individual genius. When the Eiffel Tower was first built, many nobles and prominent figures in the arts signed a letter opposing its construction, and some newspapers followed suit, saying that the tower ruined the beauty of Paris and damaged its reputation, etc. Among those who signed the letter were the musician Gounod, the novelist Maupassant, and the younger Dumas. A hundred years have passed. If Maupassant and the younger Dumas were still alive, I wonder what they would think? Would they also be proud that Paris has the Eiffel Tower?

The Eiffel Tower was the symbol of the Paris Exposition in the year it was built and is now a symbol of France. The Eiffel Tower stands silently, a testament to France's outstanding contribution to the world's architectural treasures.

　　无言的埃菲尔铁塔
　　顾孟潮　张百平
    今年是法国大革命二百周年。二百年前是一股强大的新生社会力量——资产阶级诞生的年代。资产阶级是法国大革命的真正胜利者。这是一场政治革命，更是一场工业革命，资产阶级是随着工业革命的进展生长起来的。法国政府为庆祝１７８９年法国资产阶级大革命一百周年，决定举办世界博览会，建立永久性纪念物，这便是埃菲尔铁塔诞生的背景。
    一百年来，埃菲尔铁塔接待了欧洲各国所有的和来自各大洲的国王、元首。现在每年大约要招揽２００至３００万来自世界各地的游客。近年，法国政府为了使铁塔能接待更多的游人，耗资３０００万美元，对其进行大修加固。如把沉重的混凝土地面换成了钢板地面，把古老缓慢的水力升降机改成一日可运送万人的高速双层电梯，把一些生锈的部件更换掉。第三层还加设了玻璃窗和其它安全装置。
    埃菲尔铁塔的建成，更加深刻的意义在于它不是一个孤立的现象。它应和了当时欧洲工业革命的成功，城市人口急剧增长，城市与市镇在数量上成倍地成长，新的都市化社会产生，以及对交通运输和新建筑的迫切需要。追赶时代潮流的建筑师们，迫不急待地在寻求一种能反映时代变更的建筑风格。突破旧的建筑艺术观念的束缚，找到新的建筑艺术形式语言这一历史使命，最早是由伟大的工程师和测量师们来完成的。古斯塔夫·埃菲尔是其中最杰出的代表。他设计的埃菲尔铁塔是这种新的建筑艺术观念的里程碑。与其同时或先后完成的桥梁、道路、运河和教堂、船坞等都起着冲击旧观念的作用，所以，无论是就成果而言，还是就设计创造者本人讲，他们都堪称“埃菲尔的兄弟”。
    埃菲尔铁塔建成一百年了，从它的产生、被公认到今天人们仍然纪念它这一事实，我们会受到不少启发。风格的产生不是哪个人凭天才可以随意捏造的。埃菲尔铁塔建设之初，不少贵族和文艺界的显赫人物，联名写信反对修建，有些报纸也跟着推波助澜，说铁塔破坏了巴黎的美，损害了她的盛名等等。在信上签名的有音乐家古诺，小说家莫泊桑、小仲马等。一百年过去了，如果莫泊桑、小仲马等还健在的话，不知会有何感想？是否也会为巴黎有埃菲尔铁塔而自豪？
    埃菲尔铁塔建成当年是巴黎博览会的标志，现在成为法兰西的标志。埃菲尔铁塔无言矗立，它是法国对世界建筑艺术宝库的杰出贡献。
