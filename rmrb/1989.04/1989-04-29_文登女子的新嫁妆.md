During a visit to the rural areas of Wéndēng City, Shandong Province, I noticed that many young women who were about to get married preferred to have two dairy goats as part of their dowry, even if it meant having fewer other items. If lactating goats were not available, two goat kids would do.

Why are dairy goats so popular? It turns out that a dairy goat is like a small family bank. In 1988, the average income from the 70,000 dairy goats in the city was 397 yuan per goat. A lactating goat could bring in a net income of over 500 yuan per year. Last year, the dairy goats increased the farmers' income by over 20 million yuan. Wéndēng City has become one of the best dairy goat bases in the country in terms of total milk production, yield per goat, and social benefits.

The development of dairy goats in Wéndēng City began in 1978. Over the past eleven years, the city's leadership has changed four times. However, each new leader has prioritized the "goat business," continuously improving the goat farming mechanism like a relay race, making the city's dairy goats grow stronger and more numerous. Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, Yán Róngzhú, often visits dairy product factories and goat-farming villages for in-depth investigations and problem-solving. Following the lead of the city's top officials, all levels of cadres work together to promote goat farming. A group of officials dedicated to the "goat industry" are affectionately called "Goat Secretaries," "Goat Mayors," and "Goat Managers" by the people.

In 1983, due to the lack of industrial processing capacity, farmers had to dump unsold fresh milk, severely dampening their enthusiasm. The incident shook the officials at all levels: to do something good for the farmers, general calls and enthusiasm were not enough; they had to establish a good mechanism according to scientific and economic laws. After several years of continuous efforts, the city has established a series of guarantee and service systems from the introduction of high-quality breeds, breeding, to dairy processing. The city invested more than 100,000 yuan to build a high-quality breed farm, and 187 breeding points provide free breeding services for goats. Last year alone, 140,000 yuan was subsidized for breeding fees. A team of over 1,000 people ensures the timely collection of fresh milk. The city has built four dairy product factories, processing 4,400 tons of milk powder last year, accounting for more than 70% of the province's total production. To motivate farmers to raise goats, the city continuously gives benefits to farmers, adjusting the fresh milk purchase price from 0.14 yuan per jin to 0.32 yuan, and providing free technical services to the farmers.

Goat farming brings real benefits to farmers, who treasure their dairy goats. Currently, Wéndēng City has over 70,000 dairy goats. In the Kunyushan area, towns like Shàizì and Jièshí have an average of 1.5 goats per household. Some young women, after receiving good dairy goats from their parents, no longer ask for "dowry money." They say: "This is better than giving a few dead coins!"

　　文登女子的新嫁妆
    初宜杰
    在山东省文登市农村采访，看到不少即将出嫁的姑娘宁可少要别的陪嫁，也得要两只奶山羊。盛产期的母羊弄不到，给两只奶羊羔也成。
    奶山羊何以受到如此青睐？原来一只奶山羊就是一个家庭小银行。一九八八年，全市七万只奶山羊平均每只收入三百九十七元，一只盛产期的奶羊年纯收入能达到五百多元。去年全市农民饲养奶山羊增加收入二千多万元。文登市也成为全国山羊奶总产最多、单产最高、社会效益最好的奶山羊基地之一。
    文登市发展奶山羊是自一九七八年开始的，十一年间市里的主要领导已换任四茬。但每茬领导上任，都把“发羊财”的事放在心上，像接力赛跑那样不断完善养羊业的机制，使全市的奶山羊像滚雪球一样发展壮大。市委书记焉荣竹经常到乳品厂、养羊乡蹲点，有时候一蹲就是好几天，通过深入实际，调查研究，解决问题。在市主要领导的带动下，全市各级干部同心协力抓养羊，一批热心于“羊事业”的干部被群众亲切地唤作“羊书记”、“羊乡长”、“羊经理”。
    一九八三年，由于工业加工能力未配套，养羊户只好把卖不出去的鲜奶白白倒掉，严重挫伤了群众的积极性。全市各级干部从这件事受到震动：为农民办件好事实事，光凭一般性号召和满腔热情是远远不够的，必须按照科学规律和经济规律建立一套良好机制。经过几年持续努力，全市建立了从良种引进、繁育，直到乳品加工的一系列保障、服务体制。市里投资十多万元建起良种场，一百八十七个配种点免费为羊配种，仅去年就补贴配种费十四万元。由一千多人组成的鲜奶收购队伍保证定点定时收购。市里建设了四座乳品厂，去年加工奶粉四千四百吨，占全省总产的百分之七十多。为了调动群众养羊的积极性，这个市不断为农民让利，鲜奶收购价格由每市斤零点一四元逐步调整到零点三二元，并免费为群众提供技术服务。
    养羊业为农民带来实惠，农民把奶山羊当作宝贝疙瘩，目前文登市的奶山羊存养量突破七万只。昆嵛山区的晒字、界石等乡镇，每户平均一点五只羊。一些女青年要了父母的好奶羊，就不要“压箱钱”了。她们说：这比给几个死钱强！
