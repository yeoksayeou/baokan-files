Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, April 5th.

The seven state-allocated coal mines in Shanxi Province produced 219 million tons of raw coal in the first quarter of this year, exceeding the plan by 8.278 million tons. Major economic and technical indicators such as washed coal production and development footage also completed the national plan.

To alleviate the nationwide coal supply tension, the 380,000 miners from the seven state-allocated coal mines, including Datong, Yangquan, Xishan, and Jincity, have been working day and night. The average single production of mechanized mining faces in the first quarter increased by 2,629 tons compared to the same period last year, creating a new record of 56.16 million tons.

Shanxi Province's state-allocated coal mines have also strengthened the coordination between roads and mines, focusing on the transportation of coal to ensure the fulfillment of contracts. In the first quarter, 16.8 million tons more coal were transported compared to the same period last year, increasing the contract fulfillment rate from 92.35% last year to 97.24%.
