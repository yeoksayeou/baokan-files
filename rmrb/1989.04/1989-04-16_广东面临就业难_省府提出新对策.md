Guangdong is currently facing significant employment challenges. The provincial government has proposed new strategies to address this issue.

According to recent predictions from relevant departments in Guangdong Province, over the next 10 years, the province will need to provide employment for 500,000 people annually in urban areas. Additionally, tens of thousands of surplus laborers from enterprises will gradually be absorbed by society rather than within the enterprises themselves. As agricultural productivity improves, nearly 10 million surplus rural laborers will emerge. With the increasing marketization of employment, structural unemployment, selective unemployment, and the transition from employment to unemployment will become more pronounced.

In response, relevant officials from the provincial government have called for the vigorous development of collective and individual economies to create more job opportunities.

　　广东面临就业难　省府提出新对策
    本报广州４月１５日电　记者梁兆明报道：广东新的就业难已经出现。
    广东省有关部门最近预测，今后１０年，全省城镇每年有５０万人需要就业；数以１０万计的企业富余劳动力，将逐步从企业内部消化转由社会安置；随着农业生产力的提高，将出现近１０００万的农村剩余劳动力；由于就业的日益市场化，结构性待业、选择性待业和就业转待业等现象，将会日趋突出。
    为此，省政府有关负责人要求大力发展集体经济和个体经济，提供更多的就业机会。
