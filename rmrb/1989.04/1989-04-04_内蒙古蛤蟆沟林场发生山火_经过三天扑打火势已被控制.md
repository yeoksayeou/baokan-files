A forest fire occurred in the Hamagou Forest Farm in Inner Mongolia's Xing'an League. After three days of intense firefighting, the flames on the south, north, and west fronts have been controlled, and a breakout on the east front has also been extinguished.

Currently, over 2,000 military, police, and civilian personnel are working to clear the fire site and extinguish any remaining smoldering fires.

The fire covered an area of approximately 80 square kilometers, mostly consisting of gullies and marshes. The fire did not result in any casualties, and the economic losses are still being assessed. The cause of the fire has not yet been determined, but it is suspected to have been caused by a fishing boat on the Tuokexin River in the forest farm that had a wildfire.

　　内蒙古蛤蟆沟林场发生山火
    经过三天扑打火势已被控制
    本报呼和浩特讯  记者傲腾报道：记者从内蒙古防火指挥部获悉：３月３０日内蒙古兴安盟蛤蟆沟林场发生的山火，经过三天的奋力扑打，南、北、西三面的火线已被控制，东线突破隔离带的一股火也已被消灭。
    目前，火场有２０００余名军、警、民，正在清理火场，扑灭暗火。
    这次山火面积约８０平方公里，多数为沟塘、草甸子；火灾未造成人员伤亡，经济损失目前还估计不出来，造成山火原因也尚未查清，据估计可能是林场内托欣河上的打渔人野炊火所致。
