Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 31st.

State Chairman Yang Shangkun this morning met with delegates from Tibet attending the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress. He emphasized that the current priorities for Tibet are to focus on construction and development, and to manage the work with monasteries and monks.

Yang Shangkun, during his conversation with the delegates, said that the work in Tibet should first focus on developing production and improving the lives of the people. Improving the lives of the people will contribute to social stability in Tibet. Tibet is primarily an agricultural and pastoral region with limited modern industry, so developing production and improving the lives of the people is a long-term task. Tibet has abundant resources, and there is great potential for economic development.

Yang Shangkun said that many Tibetan people are religious, so monasteries and monks hold a special position in Tibet. During the "Cultural Revolution," the "leftist" policies caused some damage to religion, but these have been corrected in recent years. The state has provided some benefits to monasteries and monks, such as allocating funds to repair some monasteries and emphasizing freedom of religious belief. These policies have been supported by the monks.

Regarding the riots in Lhasa, Yang Shangkun said that the situation has stabilized somewhat, but there will still be disturbances from external forces. As long as we remain united, we have nothing to fear. Vice Chairman Apho once said: Tibetans cannot do without the Han, and the Han cannot do without the Tibetans. I think that in our country of over 50 ethnic groups, none can do without the others.

　　杨尚昆看望西藏代表
    要求抓好建设做好喇嘛工作
    据新华社北京３月３１日电  （记者李慧、羊慧明）国家主席杨尚昆今天上午在看望出席七届全国人大二次会议的西藏代表时指出，当前西藏一要抓好建设发展，二要做好寺庙喇嘛的工作。
    杨尚昆在和代表们交谈时说，西藏的工作首先要从发展生产、改善群众生活抓起。群众生活搞好了，有利于西藏社会稳定。西藏现在主要是畜牧业，没有多少现代工业，因此，发展生产、改善人民生活是长期的任务。西藏资源丰富，发展经济大有潜力。
    杨尚昆说，藏族群众信教的很多，因此宗教、寺庙在西藏有着特殊地位。“文化大革命”中“左”的那一套，对宗教造成一些破坏，这几年我们纠正了。国家对寺庙喇嘛给了一些优惠，如拨钱修复一些寺庙，强调宗教信仰自由。这样的政策得到了喇嘛的拥护。
    谈到拉萨骚乱，杨尚昆说，现在局势稳定一些了，但外来势力的捣乱还会有，只要我们自己团结了，就不怕。阿沛副委员长过去讲了一句话：藏族离不开汉族，汉族离不开藏族。我看我们国家５０多个民族谁也离不开谁。
