Newspaper report: Singaporean guzheng performer Ouyang Liangrong recently spoke to Beijing's media about the influence of the Chinese guzheng overseas. Mr. Ouyang is 40 years old and began learning the guzheng at the age of 17. He has studied under various schools, including those from Henan, Shanghai, and the Hakka region, and has developed unique playing techniques. Apart from being highly regarded in Singapore, he has also performed in Switzerland, Malaysia, West Germany, the United States, Egypt, Canada, and other countries. His performances in Taiwan have received praise from local audiences and critics. While preserving the traditional art of the guzheng, he is dedicated to promoting it and has taught over a hundred students. Recently, he plans to use this ancient instrument to perform popular and rock music to further expand the guzheng's influence in contemporary Western countries. He mentioned that currently, nearly 700,000 people in Japan are learning the guzheng, and the number in Southeast Asian countries is also significant, but it seems relatively quiet on the mainland. He intends to showcase his guzheng studies at the "World Audio-Visual Expo" in Beijing this June. Warner Bros. Records, which has launched famous Hong Kong and Taiwanese singers like Su Rui, will invest heavily in supporting Mr. Ouyang's ideas and publish his solo album.

    欧阳良荣谈“古筝在海外”
    本报讯  新加坡古筝演奏家欧阳良荣先生最近在北京向新闻界人士畅谈中国古筝在海外的影响。欧阳先生今年４０岁，１７岁时习古筝，对河南、上海、客家诸派均有所承，指法独到。除在新加坡享有盛誉外，还先后到过瑞士、马来西亚、联邦德国、美国、埃及、加拿大等国演出，在台湾举行的多场音乐会上受到当地听众和评论界赞扬。他在发扬古筝传统的同时，致力于推广，并授徒百余人。近来又计划用这一古老乐器演奏流行音乐和摇滚乐，以扩大古筝在当代西方各国的影响。他介绍说，目前日本学习古筝的人数近７０万，东南亚各国也很可观，但在大陆似乎过于冷清。他打算今年６月在北京举行的“世界音像博览会”上向听众表演他对古筝的研习成就。曾推出苏芮等港台著名歌星的国际华纳唱片公司将耗重金支持欧阳先生的构想，并出版他的独奏专辑。　　　　（文一）
