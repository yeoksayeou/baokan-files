Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 22nd.

Comrades,

Today, we gather with profound grief to mourn the passing of a seasoned and loyal communist warrior, a great revolutionary and statesman of the proletariat, an outstanding political worker of our army, and an outstanding leader who held important positions in the Party for a long time, Comrade Hu Yaobang.

Comrade Hu Yaobang, as a Marxist, had a brilliant life. Over the course of 60 years of revolutionary struggle, he remained steadfast in his loyalty to the Party and the people, dedicating his heart and soul, working tirelessly, and making indelible contributions. The passing of Comrade Hu Yaobang is a tremendous loss for our Party and people, and for the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

Comrade Hu Yaobang joined the new democratic revolution in his youth. Born into a poor peasant family in Liuyang County, Hunan Province, on November 20, 1915, he joined the Communist Youth League of China in the winter of 1929 and became a member of the Communist Party of China in 1933. At that time, he worked in the revolutionary bases of Jiangxi, Hunan, and Fujian, promoting the Party's policies and actively fighting against feudal forces and the Kuomintang reactionaries. In 1934, he participated in the famous Long March, where he was wounded in the battle of Luoshan Pass, and to this day, fragments of enemy bullets remain in his body. After arriving in Shaanxi, he successively served as the Secretary-General, Propaganda Department Head, and Organization Department Head of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he served as the Director of the Organization Department of the General Political Department of the Central Military Commission. During the War of Liberation, he served as the Acting Political Commissar of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region, the Political Commissar of the Fourth and Third Columns of the People's Liberation Army, and the Director of the Political Department of the 18th Army Group, participating in the battles of Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, and Baoji. He made important contributions to the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation.

After the founding of New China, Comrade Hu Yaobang served as the Secretary of the Party Committee of the Chuanbei Region, the Director of the Chuanbei Administrative Office, and the Political Commissar of the Military Region, leading the people of Chuanbei in land reform, bandit suppression, and the rapid restoration and development of industrial and agricultural production. From 1952 onwards, he long served as the head of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, successively serving as the Secretary of the Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League of China and the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China. During this period, he creatively implemented the central directives, opening the most active period of the Party's youth work since the founding of the nation and accumulating important experience. In particular, he paid great attention to educating youth with communist ideology in practice, organizing a variety of colorful activities according to the characteristics of youth, advocating a style of "vibrant and pragmatic," making the Youth League highly attractive, and thus leading the broad masses of youth to successfully complete the glorious tasks entrusted by the Party. From the end of 1964, during his tenure as the Second Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the First Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee, he conducted in-depth investigations, worked diligently, and promoted the construction of various projects in the region.

During the Cultural Revolution, Comrade Hu Yaobang suffered severe persecution. However, he paid no heed to personal honor and danger, and relentlessly fought against the counter-revolutionary cliques of Lin Biao and Jiang Qing. In 1975, he took charge of the leadership of the Party organization of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and resolutely rectified the disruption of scientific work by the counter-revolutionary clique of Jiang Qing.

After the overthrow of the counter-revolutionary clique of Jiang Qing, Comrade Hu Yaobang successively served as the Vice President of the Central Party School, the Minister of the Organization Department, the Third Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the Secretary-General of the Central Committee, and the Minister of Propaganda. Comrade Hu Yaobang was a member of the Central Committee of the 8th, 11th, 12th, and 13th Congresses of the Communist Party of China. At the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, he was elected as a member of the Political Bureau, and at the 5th Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, he was elected as a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau and the General Secretary of the Central Committee. At the 6th Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, he was elected as the Chairman of the Central Committee. He was a member and a Standing Committee member of the 12th Central Political Bureau and a member of the 13th Central Political Bureau. After the 2nd Plenary Session of the 12th Central Committee, he concurrently served as the Director of the Central Commission for Party Rectification. From September 1982 to January 1987, he served as the General Secretary of the Central Committee.

Since the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, our country has been in an important historical period of rectifying errors and carrying out comprehensive reforms. At the 12th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Hu Yaobang, on behalf of the Central Committee, delivered a report titled "Comprehensively Opening Up a New Situation for the Construction of Socialist Modernization," which further clarified the Party's guiding ideology in the new era. Over the past eleven years, as one of the Party's main leaders, he has been committed to combining Marxist basic principles with the reality of China's modernization construction. He has made significant contributions in many aspects to upholding the line of the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, adhering to the four cardinal principles, and promoting reform and opening up to build socialism with Chinese characteristics.

— He organized and promoted the discussion on the criterion of truth, adhering to the spirit of seeking truth from facts and emancipating the mind, to break through the serious constraints of the "two whatevers" and re-establish the Party's Marxist ideological line.

— With extraordinary courage and bravery, he organized and led the extensive work of rectifying wrongful, false, and erroneous cases and implementing cadre policies, enabling a large number of senior cadres who had been persecuted to return to their leadership positions and allowing other cadres, intellectuals, and the masses who had suffered injustice and persecution to be exonerated and have their reputations restored.

— He valued mobilizing the enthusiasm of 800 million peasants, presiding over the formulation and implementation of a series of policies for rural reform, and promoting the rapid development of China's rural economy.

— He valued mobilizing the enthusiasm of the Chinese working class, participating in the formulation of the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Economic System Reform," and promoting the comprehensive economic system reform with cities as the focus. He devoted a great deal of effort to expanding the opening up of coastal areas and developing socialist commodity economy.

— He respected knowledge and talent, attaching importance to the Party's scientific work, educational work, literary and artistic work, and news work. In his speech on the growth path of contemporary Chinese young intellectuals, he enthusiastically encouraged them to go to the grassroots, to the masses, and to the practice of the Four Modernizations, to temper themselves and grow healthily. He successively presided over the formulation of the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Educational System Reform" and the "Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Guiding Principles for the Construction of Socialist Spiritual Civilization."

— He made extensive and effective efforts to improve the multi-party cooperation and political consultation system under the leadership of the Communist Party, promote national unity, and develop the economy and culture of ethnic minorities.

— At the meeting convened by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Marx's death, he delivered a lengthy speech titled "The Great Truth of Marxism Illuminates Our Way Forward," fully expressing the Party's firm belief in upholding and developing Marxism under new historical conditions. To strengthen the Party's ideological, style, discipline, and organizational construction, and to promote the rejuvenation of leading cadres and the reform of the cadre system, he made unremitting efforts.

— He made efforts to restore and develop the relationship between the Communist Party of China and other communist parties and workers' parties in some countries, to develop the relationship between our Party and foreign social democratic parties, nationalist parties, and other parties, to enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the Chinese people and the governments and peoples of other countries, and to make significant adjustments to China's foreign policy in the new era.

Comrade Hu Yaobang devoted his entire life to our great cause. He deeply loved the Party and the people, and the Party and the people deeply loved him. The entire Party and the people of the whole country deeply mourn Comrade Hu Yaobang, which is to learn from his great revolutionary spirit and noble moral character.

We should learn from Comrade Hu Yaobang's loyalty to the Party's cause, dedication, and struggle for communism. He had a strong sense of revolutionary responsibility and political responsibility, tirelessly working for the benefit of the people. In the past two years, he still showed great enthusiasm for China's reform and opening up and modernization construction, tirelessly visiting the grassroots to conduct investigations, encouraging cadres and the masses to correctly understand the situation and the bright future, closely uniting around the Party Central Committee, and striving forward with renewed spirit.

We should learn from Comrade Hu Yaobang's close ties with the masses, concern for the people's hardships, and wholehearted service to the people. He always paid attention to making friends widely, understanding their wishes and demands through direct contact and frank discussions with the people, including the intellectuals and non-Party friends, and drawing political wisdom and nourishment from them. He often traveled long distances to visit old revolutionary bases, ethnic minority areas, remote areas, and poverty-stricken mountainous regions, having heart-to-heart talks with local cadres and masses, and discussing strategies for poverty alleviation and prosperity, promoting the development and opening up of these regions. He also often visited the frontiers and coastal defense outposts of the motherland to warmly comfort the sons and daughters of the people. While handling important affairs of the Party and the state, he personally handled a large number of letters from the people, helping to solve their difficulties.

We should learn from Comrade Hu Yaobang's noble character of considering the overall situation, being upright and honest, being humble and studious, and being clean and upright. He always put the interests of the Party and the people first, with an open mind, not hiding his political views, daring to insist on what is correct, and bravely self-criticizing when he was wrong. He set an example, treated people kindly, had a democratic style, never let go of books, pursued new knowledge, and maintained the vitality of communists to strive for progress.

Comrade Hu Yaobang has left us forever. We should turn our grief into strength and complete his unfinished work. We should unite as one, more closely unite around the Party Central Committee, and strive with perseverance to complete the arduous tasks of rectification and deepening reform, and to achieve the grand goal of building socialist modernization in China!

Comrade Hu Yaobang will live forever!

    赵紫阳     
   （１９８９年４月２２日）
    同志们：
    今天，我们怀着极其沉痛的心情，悼念久经考验的忠诚的共产主义战士，伟大的无产阶级革命家、政治家，我军杰出的政治工作者，长期担任党的重要领导职务的卓越领导人胡耀邦同志。
    胡耀邦同志作为马克思主义者，他的一生是光辉的。在长达６０年的革命生涯中，他始终如一地对党和人民的事业忠心耿耿，呕心沥血，艰苦奋斗，立下了不朽的功勋。胡耀邦同志的逝世，对于我们的党和人民，对于我国的社会主义现代化建设事业，都是巨大的损失。
    胡耀邦同志从青少年起就投身新民主主义革命。他是湖南省浏阳县人，１９１５年１１月２０日出生在贫苦的农民家庭，１９２９年冬加入中国共产主义青年团，１９３３年转为中国共产党党员。当时他在江西、湖南和福建革命根据地从事青少年工作，宣传党的主张，积极同封建势力和国民党反动派开展斗争。１９３４年他参加了举世闻名的二万五千里长征，在攻打娄山关战斗中负伤，他的身上至今还留有敌人的弹片。到达陕北后，他先后担任少共中央局秘书长、宣传部长和组织部长。抗日战争时期，他曾担任中央军委总政治部组织部部长。解放战争时期，他历任冀热辽军区代理政治部主任、中国人民解放军晋察冀军区第四纵队和第三纵队政治委员、第十八兵团政治部主任，先后参加了保卫张家口、解放石家庄、太原和宝鸡等战役。他为抗日战争和人民解放战争的胜利作出了重要贡献。

    ——他为恢复和发展中国共产党同其他一些国家共产党、工人党的关系，为发展我党同外国社会党、民族主义政党及其他政党的关系，为增进中国人民同世界各国政府和人民的相互了解和友谊，为我国对外政策在新时期的重大调整，作出了努力。
    胡耀邦同志把毕生精力献给了我们的伟大事业。他深深地热爱党和人民，党和人民也深深地热爱他。全党全国人民深切悼念胡耀邦同志，就是要学习他伟大的革命精神和高尚的思想品德。
    我们要学习胡耀邦同志忠诚党的事业，鞠躬尽瘁，为共产主义奋斗的献身精神。他具有强烈的革命事业心和政治责任感，不知疲倦地为人民群众谋利益。近两年来，他仍以很高的热情关注我国改革开放和现代化建设的进展，不辞劳苦，到基层调查研究，鼓励干部、群众正确认识形势和光明前途，紧密团结在党中央的周围，振奋精神，继续前进。

    我们要学习胡耀邦同志顾全大局，光明磊落，谦虚好学，廉洁奉公的高贵品德。他以党和人民的利益为重，胸怀坦荡，不隐瞒自己的政治观点，正确的东西，敢于坚持；自己错了，勇于自我批评。他以身作则，待人宽厚，作风民主，手不释卷，追求新知，保持共产党人不断进取的活力。
    胡耀邦同志与我们永别了。我们要化悲痛为力量，完成他未竟的事业。我们要同心同德，更加紧密地团结在党中央的周围，为完成治理整顿和深化改革的艰巨任务，实现我国社会主义现代化建设的宏伟目标，坚韧不拔，努力奋斗！
