	Four Taboos for Informants
	Due to our work, we have come into contact with many informants' materials and have conducted some investigations and research. We believe that to do a good job in the informants' work, from the perspective of the informants, there should be "four taboos":

	First, avoid hesitation and missing the opportunity. Some informants should have reported the situation early, but because they are afraid of retaliation and fear that the law enforcement agencies will not handle the case seriously, they hesitate and do not take action. As a result, the lawbreakers destroy evidence and coordinate their statements, missing the opportunity and increasing the difficulty of verification.

	Second, avoid exaggeration and wasting manpower. Some informants, when writing their reports, deliberately make the case seem very serious. Law enforcement agencies, in order to verify the facts, have to expend a great deal of manpower and resources. Therefore, informants should strive to be objective and truthful.

	Third, avoid providing insufficient materials, making it difficult to verify. Experience has shown that cases with detailed informants' materials are much easier to handle, whereas the opposite is very difficult.

	Fourth, avoid reporting and then doing nothing more. Some informants, after reporting the relevant situation to the judicial authorities, think that everything is settled. As a result, due to various reasons, the judicial authorities do not get the chance to handle the case, and the lawbreakers become even more brazen. If the informants do not keep abreast of the situation and communicate with the judicial authorities, it will inevitably lead to an unfavorable situation.

　　举报人四忌
    由于工作的关系，我们接触了不少举报材料，同时做了一些调查研究。我们认为，要搞好举报工作，从举报人的角度来讲，应有“四忌”：
    一忌犹豫不决，贻误战机。一些举报人本当及早举报，却因为怕打击报复，怕执法机关查办不力而犹豫再三，举步不前。结果，违法犯罪分子趁机销毁证据，串连口供，贻误了战机，增加了查证难度。
    二忌夸大其辞，空耗人力。有的举报人写举报材料时，故意把案情写得十分严重，执法机关为挤干水份，不得不付出大量的人力物力进行核实。因此，举报人应做到实事求是。
    三忌材料太空，难以查实。事实证明，凡举报材料翔实的案件，查办起来就容易得多，反之就很困难。
    四忌一报了之，不再努力。有些举报人员向司法机关举报了有关情况，便认为万事大吉了。结果，由于种种原因，司法机关没来得及查处，违法犯罪分子反而变本加厉，举报人如不及时掌握情况，与司法机关通报，势必造成不利局面。
