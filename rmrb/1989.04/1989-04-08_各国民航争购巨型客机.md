With the shift of the international economic focus to the Asia-Pacific region, the tourism industry in this area is expected to flourish over the next 5 to 6 years. Many countries and regions' airlines are already preparing to welcome this prosperity.

Currently, the longest flight duration of the aircraft used by various airlines is 9 hours. Passengers traveling from the United States and Europe to the Asia-Pacific region often have to stop for refueling or transfer to other flights. Therefore, airlines urgently need long-range aircraft to solve this problem.

The business-savvy Boeing Aircraft Company of the United States has timely announced that it will launch a giant aircraft this year capable of flying halfway around the world without landing. It is said that this 747-400 model can not only accommodate 400 passengers but also fly for 13 to 18 hours without landing, and it is fast. Flying from London or Los Angeles to Tokyo will take only 3.5 hours.

Seeing that whoever can first own this type of aircraft and open more long-range routes will be the first to make a fortune, airlines are flocking to Boeing, rushing to place orders.

　　各国民航争购巨型客机
    随着国际经济热点的东移，亚洲太平洋地区的旅游业在今后５至６年内将呈现繁荣景象。许多国家和地区的民航公司已为迎接财星预作准备。
    目前各民航公司使用的客机的续航时间最多为９小时，美、欧旅客到亚太地区往往要在中途等候加油或转乘其他航线飞机。因此各民航公司迫切需要飞行半径大的远程客机以解决这个问题。
    有敏锐“生意眼”的美国波音飞机制造公司及时宣布，要在今年推出能够不着陆飞行半个地球的巨型客机。据说，这种７４７—４００型的客机不仅可容纳４００名乘客，飞行１３至１８小时不着陆而且速度快，从伦敦或洛杉矶飞东京，只需要３．５小时。
    各民航公司看到谁能先拥有这种客机，多开辟一些远程航线，谁便能先发大财。于是他们纷纷涌到波音公司，争先恐后地订购。
