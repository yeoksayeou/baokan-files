	India's 125,000 dock workers began an indefinite strike at midnight on the 16th, causing cargo handling at all 11 major Indian ports to come to a standstill.

	A spokesperson for the All India Port and Dock Workers Federation said today that due to the stalemate in negotiations between the federation and the government over the issue of wage increases for workers, they had no choice but to go on strike.

	The federation initially demanded a 60% wage increase, but later reduced this to 25%. However, the government only agreed to a 15.1% increase. Indian officials said that negotiations are still ongoing. Meanwhile, the Indian Navy and Army have deployed troops at the ports to prevent any disturbances that may arise from the strike.

　　印度十二万码头工人罢工
　　十一港口装卸工作陷于瘫痪
    新华社新德里四月十七日电　印度全国十二点五万名码头装卸工人于十六日午夜开始举行不定期罢工，致使印度所有十一个主要港口的装卸工作陷于瘫痪。
    印度全国港口、码头工人联合会人士今天说，由于联合会同政府就给工人增加工资问题举行的谈判陷于僵局，他们别无他择，只有罢工。
    联合会最初要求给工人增加工资百分之六十，但后来又将增加幅度降到百分之二十五。然而，政府方面只答应给增加百分之十五点一。印度官方人士说，目前谈判仍在进行。与此同时，印度海军和陆军已在港口部署了部队，以防止由罢工而引起的骚乱。
