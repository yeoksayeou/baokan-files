The Chinese film industry currently has a saying: 1988 was the "Year of Wang Shuo." Wang Shuo is a writer, and four of his novels were adapted into films by four different studios in the past year.

Up until now, Wang Shuo remains a "freelance writer" or "independent writer." He never attended university, served in the military for a few years, and then worked as a clerk at a traditional Chinese medicine company. He quit his job to start a business, which failed, and then "enlightened himself" to pursue a literary career. His works benefit from his unique experiences and perceptions.

The Emei Film Studio directed "Rebel" by Mi Jianshan, the Xi'an Film Studio directed "Reincarnation" (original novel title "Floating Above the Surface") by Huang Jianxin, Ye Daying directed "Breathless" (original novel title "Rubber Man") at the Shenzhen Film Company, and the Beijing Film Studio directed "Half Sea Water, Half Fire" by Xia Gang. These four films were released in quick succession, and the characters and stories in the films are unlike anything seen in previous Chinese films, thus creating the "Wang Shuo Phenomenon."

Reactions to this phenomenon have been mixed, with both praise and criticism. Under the impact of the entertainment film wave in 1988, film studios generally only invested in films that could sell copies. They also believed that Wang Shuo's novels would attract a large audience. The more this was the case, the more the "Wang Shuo Phenomenon" was worth studying.

Shi Fangyu frankly admitted that Wang Shuo wrote about many aspects of life that people are completely unfamiliar with. He classified Wang Shuo's four films among the best and relatively good Chinese films of 1988; China produces many "trash films" each year, but Wang Shuo's films are not among them.

A considerable number of people have a mixed reaction to these films, half admiring and half worrying. They admire the talent of the 30-year-old Wang Shuo but worry about the strong nihilistic tendencies in the films. Zhang Sitao said that Wang Shuo has torn away everything of value, from the political to the ethical, and has negated the value of the individual, friendship, and love, leaving people at a loss.

In response to some critics who pointed out that Wang Shuo's films lack the provision of idealistic strength, Chen Siyun refuted, saying that Wang Shuo, through his characters, wrote about the modern diseases of socialist society. The characters he created are from an imperfect socialist system; theorists can discuss the drawbacks brought by reform and opening up, but aren't Wang Shuo and film artists also doing the same thing?!

Lei Da believes that Wang Shuo writes about modern urban civilization, which is a significant gap in contemporary Chinese literature. He pointed out that the literary level of Wang Shuo's films is not high, and Wang Shuo's films only destroy the prevailing values of reality.

Shao Mujun pointed out that Wang Shuo's films attract audiences through two forms of release: one is sexual release, and the other is political release. Especially the bold satire and mockery of politics; this reflects the abnormal behavior and psychology of young people in a sick society; from the perspective of ideology, Wang Shuo's films are low-level, realistic but shallow, sincere but evil.

Huang Shixian of the Beijing Film Academy believes that the emergence of Wang Shuo's films is a very dangerous signal for Chinese cinema. He said that none of the people in Wang Shuo's works create value for society, and they all despise knowledge. Writers and professors often become objects of ridicule.

Some people also refer to the Wang Shuo phenomenon as a "counter-mainstream cultural phenomenon."

Wang Shuo's journey is still long.

This year, the film industry will continue to adapt his works. It can be predicted that people's interest in and discussions about the Wang Shuo phenomenon will continue.

　　王朔的电影引起争议
    本报记者　李力
    我国电影界目前有个说法：一九八八年是“王朔年”。王朔是一位作家，他有四部小说在过去的一年里由四家电影厂搬上银幕。
    直到目前为止，王朔依然是“无业游民”，或称“作家个体户”。他没有进过大学，当了几年兵又到药材公司当了小职员，自动退职跑买卖不成便“立地成佛”走上斯文之路。他的作品得益于独特的经历与独特的感受。
    峨眉电影制片厂米家山执导《顽主》，西安电影制片厂黄建新执导《轮回》（小说名《浮出海面》），叶大鹰在深圳影业公司执导《大喘气》（小说原名《橡皮人》），北京电影制片厂夏钢执导《一半是海水，一半是火焰》。四部影片在短时间内密集推出，而且影片中人物和故事都是过去的中国影片所没有的，“王朔现象”由此产生。
    各方对此反响不一，有褒有贬。在一九八八年娱乐片大潮冲击下，电影厂基本上是认定影片能卖拷贝才投拍。他们也认定王朔小说将拥有大量观众。越是这样，“王朔现象”就越值得研究。
    石方禹坦率承认，王朔写了相当多的人们完全陌生的生活角落。他把王朔的四部影片归入一九八八年最好的和比较好的中国影片之列；中国每年生产不少“垃圾影片”，王朔的不在此例。
    相当一部分人对这几部影片半是欣赏，半是担忧。他们欣赏年方三十的王朔的才华，担忧影片中很浓重的虚无主义倾向。张思涛说，王朔把一切有价值的东西，从政治的到伦理的全都撕掉了，把人自身的价值、人与人的友谊与爱情都否定了，让人无所适从。
    对于有些评论家指出的王朔影片没有提供理想的力量这一批评，陈思忖反驳说，王朔通过他笔下的人物写出了社会主义社会下的现代病，他塑造的人物是不完善的社会主义制度下的人物；理论家可以探讨改革开放带来的弊病，王朔和电影艺术家们干的不也是探讨吗？！
    雷达认为，王朔写的是现代社会的都市文明，这恰好是当代中国文坛的一个极大的空缺。他指出，王朔电影的文学档次不高，王朔电影只是破坏现实流行的价值观。
    邵牧君指出，王朔电影通过两个发泄吸引观众，一是性发泄，二是政治发泄。特别是对政治的调侃和讽刺相当大胆。这反映了病态社会中青年人病态的行为与心理现象；从意识形态上看，王朔电影层次很低，真实而浅薄，真诚而邪恶。
    北京电影学院黄式宪认为，王朔电影的出现是中国电影一个极为危险的信号。他说，王朔笔下的人没有一个是为社会创造价值的，并且他们都鄙视知识，作家与教授往往成为被嘲弄的对象。
    也有人称王朔现象是一种“反主流文化现象”。
    王朔的路还长。
    今年电影界还将投拍他的作品。可以预料，人们对王朔现象的兴趣和争论还会继续下去。
