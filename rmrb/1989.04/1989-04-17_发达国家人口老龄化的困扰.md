The elderly population in developed countries is currently growing at an unprecedented rate. The problems brought about by an aging population are unprecedented in human development and have attracted global attention.

Developed countries began experiencing an aging population trend decades ago. According to United Nations statistics, in 1950, the elderly population (aged 60 and above) in developed countries was over 90 million, accounting for 11.4% of the total population. By 1985, this figure had risen to 185 million, making up 15.8% of the total population. Experts predict that by 2025, the elderly population in developed countries will reach approximately 330 million, accounting for 23.6% of the total population. Among developed countries, Western European nations are experiencing the most pronounced aging population. Currently, one in every 5.7 people is elderly, and it is projected that in 15 years, one in every three people will be elderly. In Saint-Girons village in the foothills of the Pyrenees in southern France, out of 7,700 residents, a quarter are over 60 years old. The elderly populations in North America, the Soviet Union, and Oceania are also growing significantly, accounting for 16.2%, 13.1%, and 12.3% of their respective total populations.

An aging population brings a series of economic, social, and political challenges, with the most severe being the labor force crisis. An increase in the elderly population and the expansion of the retiree cohort, coupled with a lack of young people to replace retiring workers, results in a shortage of labor. It is estimated that by 2025, the labor force in the Federal Republic of Germany will decrease by 8 million, and the ratio of economically active population to elderly population in developed countries will be 1,000 to 445.

The more elderly people there are, the heavier the burden on the economically active population. In the Federal Republic of Germany, each retiree is supported by an average of two workers, but by the year 2000, this ratio will be 1 to 1. By the end of this century, Italy's 32 million retirees' pension payments will account for one-fifth of the country's gross national product.

An aging society must bear enormous medical and health care costs, which will inevitably increase national expenditures and burden taxpayers. In 1985, the social insurance contribution rate in the Federal Republic of Germany was 30%, but it is expected to rise to 40% by 2025; Japan's rate will increase from 10% to 30%.

An aging population will also significantly alter the social consumption structure, causing industrial imbalances and new unemployment. In Italy, 500 elementary schools close each year, and in major cities, the number of children in daycare has decreased by more than 10%. In Japan, some companies producing children's clothing and daily necessities are facing difficulties and may have to switch production or go bankrupt.

In response to these issues, many countries have made various attempts to address aging and its problems. Some countries have revised the current retirement system based on the health conditions of retirees and appropriately extended the retirement age. Others have encouraged childbearing by extending paid maternity leave and increasing maternity benefits. Some countries have increased the use of robots and automated production to alleviate labor shortages. Others accept a certain number of immigrants each year. However, so far, these measures have had limited effectiveness.

　　发达国家人口老龄化的困扰
　　刘兆祥
    当前，发达国家的老年人口正以空前速度增长着。人口老龄化带来的问题是人类在自身发展中首次遇到，已引起举世关注。
    发达国家早在几十年前就出现了人口老龄化趋向。据联合国统计，一九五○年，发达国家六十岁以上的老年人口为九千多万，占其总人口的百分之十一点四。一九八五年，这些国家的老年人口增加到一点八五亿，占其总人口的百分之十五点八。专家们预测，到二○二五年，发达国家老年人口将近三点三亿，占其总人口的百分之二十三点六。在发达国家中，西欧国家的人口老龄化尤为突出。据统计，目前，五点七个人中就有一个老人，预计在十五年后，每三人中就会有一位老人。在法国南部比利牛斯山麓的圣吉隆村，七千七百名居民中四分之一超过了六十岁。北美、苏联和大洋洲的老年人口增长也非常显著，它们分别占其总人口的百分之十六点二、百分之十三点一和百分之十二点三。
    人口老龄化带来了一系列经济、社会、政治方面的难题，其中最严重的是劳动力危机。老年人口增加，退休人员队伍扩大，而青年人口又补充不了退休人员的数额，造成了社会劳动力的短缺。预计到二○二五年，联邦德国的劳动力人数将减少八百万，发达国家经济活动人口与老年人口的比例为一千比四百四十五。
    老年人口愈多，经济活动人口负担愈重。在联邦德国，每一个退休人员平均由两名工人供养，到二○○○年，就成了一比一。本世纪末，意大利三千二百万退休人员的养老金总额将占国民生产总值的五分之一。
    老龄化社会要负担巨额医疗和保健费用，这势必增加国家财政开支，同时还加重了纳税人的负担。一九八五年，联邦德国的社会保险费的交纳比例为百分之三十，到二○二五年要上升到百分之四十；日本将从百分之十上升到百分之三十。
    人口老龄化还会给社会消费结构带来很大变化，使产业结构失衡，造成新的失业。意大利每年停办的小学就有五百所之多，在较大城市，日托儿童人数下降了百分之十以上。日本一些生产儿童服装和日用品的企业陷入了不景气状态，甚至被迫转产或破产。
    针对上述情况，许多国家已为解决老龄化及其问题作出不少尝试。有的根据退休人员健康状况，修订现行退休制度，适当延长退休年龄；有的用延长带薪产假、增加产妇补贴等办法鼓励生育，增加人口。有的则较多地采用机器人，提高生产自动化程度，缓解劳动力短缺之急。有的每年接受一定数量的移民。但至今，这些措施收效甚微。
