Premier Li spoke to the Japanese economic community today at a luncheon held in his honor, addressing China's economic restructuring and Sino-Japanese economic and technological cooperation. The following is a summary of his remarks:

China has been pursuing a policy of reform and opening up for the past 10 years. During this period, we have achieved certain successes. For instance, in 1980, we set a goal to double our GDP by the end of the century. In recent years, our economy has been growing at an annual rate of over 10%, and we have already completed the first doubling ahead of schedule.

However, there have been some problems in our economic life. Last year, we experienced significant inflation, with the retail price index rising by 18.5%. The main causes of inflation were the expansion of investment and consumption funds, which led to an imbalance between total demand and total supply. In September last year, we proposed to rectify the economic environment, streamline the economic order, deepen reforms, and over the next two years or even longer, such as three or even four years, make rectifying the economic environment and streamlining the economic order an important task in our economic work. This is similar to the logic of slowing down and catching one's breath after running at a fast pace. However, our economy will not come to a halt. This year, our economic growth rate in the first quarter still reached 10%. Moreover, there is an important task to utilize this period to establish a macro-control system and economic order.

Our rectification and streamlining are not intended to change the current policy of reform and opening up, but to create better conditions for reform and opening up. China's economy will not return to the previous overly rigid and centralized economic model. China will implement a planned socialist commodity economy. A very important experience is to handle the relationship between stability, reform, and development. Reform and development should be carried out under stable conditions. The purpose of reform is economic development.

China has proposed a strategy to develop the coastal economy, and this policy will not change. The coastal regions of China are relatively developed economically, with many advantages over the inland regions, such as higher technological levels and a more skilled workforce, which allows the economy to develop faster than in the inland regions.

For foreign investment projects in China, including joint ventures and wholly foreign-owned enterprises, we have two policies. First, we will continue to honor contracts that have already been signed, even under the premise of significantly reducing construction projects. Second, we welcome new investment projects in China, including joint ventures and wholly foreign-owned enterprises. We hope that new projects will comply with China's industrial policies, which have recently been published.

The overall relationship between China and Japan is good, and in recent years, exchanges in the fields of economy, technology, education, and culture have been increasing. We are pleased that recently, the Japanese Diet has approved the Sino-Japanese Investment Protection Agreement. With the implementation of the Investment Protection Agreement, economic cooperation between the two countries will further develop.

We hope that Japanese capital will come to China to establish wholly foreign-owned or joint ventures, combining the advantages of both sides. China has the advantage of labor and certain resources and land, while Japan has the advantage of technology and capital. Combining these advantages, the prospects for development are very broad. Of course, there are many areas in the investment environment that need improvement, and with the passage of time, they will gradually improve.

In Sino-Japanese trade, over the years, trade between the two countries has developed significantly. Japan is now China's largest trading partner after Hong Kong and Macao. We hope that on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, Sino-Japanese trade can further develop.

In the second half of last year, some Chinese trading companies failed to fulfill their contractual obligations, and some Japanese trading companies have complained about this. We understand this. Last year, we reformed our trade system, decentralizing foreign trade authority from the central government to local governments and enterprises. From the perspective of the overall policy of reform and opening up, this reform is undoubtedly correct. However, it has also led to some chaos, with the establishment of many trading companies that lack operational capabilities and knowledge, leading to poor contract performance. The Chinese government attaches great importance to these issues, and we have already taken necessary measures to rectify and manage them.

In addition to financial cooperation, both the Chinese and Japanese governments support the establishment of an investment promotion association. The establishment of the Investment Promotion Association will have a positive effect on Japanese enterprises investing in China. I believe that the Japanese economic community can play a greater role in promoting investment in China, and we have high hopes for this.

Of course, we hope that large-scale backbone enterprises will come to China, but we also welcome the establishment of small and medium-sized enterprises. Compared to the past, there have been some improvements in Sino-Japanese technological cooperation, but it is still not satisfactory. Although the incident has passed, we still want to mention it, which is the Toshiba incident. This incident caused some unnecessary losses to China. There is a Chinese saying, "When the city gate catches fire, the fish in the moat suffer." We hope that such incidents will not happen again.

The current world situation has undergone tremendous changes, and maintaining peace and seeking development have become a powerful trend of the times. China pursues an independent and peaceful foreign policy and is willing to develop friendly relations with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. China and Japan are close neighbors, and the development of relations between the two countries will not only benefit the peoples of both countries but will also have a positive impact on peace in the Asia-Pacific region and the world. In the process of economic development, we can complement each other. On the basis of equality and mutual benefit, establishing a long-term stable relationship will have a great impact on Sino-Japanese friendship.

### 李总理对日经济界发表讲演

　　李总理对日经济界发表讲演
　　●中国不会回到过度集中的计划经济模式
　　●中国不改变沿海经济发展战略
　　●发挥中日各自优势建立平等互利长期稳定经济关系
　　●中日发展经济关系有益于亚太地区与世界和平
    本报东京４月１４日电　国务院总理李鹏今天中午在日本经济界举行的欢迎会上，就我国的经济治理整顿与中日经济技术合作问题发表即席讲演，摘要如下：
    中国进行改革开放的政策已经１０年。这１０年来我们取得了一定的成绩。比如说，我们在１９８０年时定下一个奋斗目标：在本世纪末中国的国民生产总值要翻两番。最近几年里，我每年都是以１０％以上速度发展，第一个翻番的任务已经提前完成。
    不过在经济生活中也出现了一些问题，就是在去年发生了明显的通货膨胀，零售物价指数上升了１８．５％。造成通货膨胀的原因，主要是投资资金的膨胀、消费资金的膨胀，也就是社会的总需求大于总供给。去年９月，我们提出了要治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序，深化改革，并且在今明两年之内或者更长一些的时间，比如３年或者甚至于４年，把治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序作为我们经济工作的重要的任务。这如同一个人经过了一个较快的速度的跑步以后要稍微放慢一下速度，需要喘息一下的道理是一样的。但是我们的经济不会停顿下来的。今年我们第一季度的经济发展的速度仍然达到１０％。而且还有一个很重要的任务，就是利用这一段时间把宏观调控体系、经济的秩序建立起来。
    我们实行治理整顿，并不是要改变现行的改革开放的政策，而是为改革开放创造更好的条件。中国的经济不会回到原来的那种管理的过死、过于集中的经济模式上去。中国要实行的是有计划的社会主义商品经济。一条非常重要的经验是要处理好稳定、改革和发展这三者之间的关系。在稳定的条件下进行改革，在稳定的条件下发展经济。改革的目的是为了经济的发展。
    中国曾经提出了发展沿海经济的战略，这个方针不会改变。中国沿海地区是经济比较发达的地区，有许多比内地更加优越的条件，另外有较高的技术水平和素质较高的劳动力，比内地经济可以发展的更快一些。
    对外国人来中国的投资项目，包括合资的和独资的，我们采取两条政策。第一是对已经签约的我们将继续履行合同，即使在大力压缩建设项目这样一个前提下。第二是欢迎新到中国来投资的项目，包括独资和合资。我们希望新项目能够符合中国的产业政策，这个产业政策，最近我国已经公布。
    中国和日本方面关系总的是好的，这些年来我们在经济、技术、教育、文化等各方面交流不断地增加。令我们高兴的是最近日本众参两院批准了中日投资保护协定。随着投资保护协定的实施，中日两国的经济合作将会进一步发展。
    我们希望日本的资本到中国来举办独资或合资企业，这样可以把各自的优势结合起来。中国方面有劳动力的优势以及某些资源优势、土地的优势，而日本方面有技术优势和资金的优势。这样结合起来，发展前途是很广阔的。当然我们在投资环境方面还有许多值得改善的地方，随着时间的推移，会逐渐地得到进步和改善。
    在中日贸易方面，多少年来中日贸易得到长足的发展。日本现在是中国的仅次于港澳的最大的贸易伙伴。我们希望在平等互利的基础上，使中日贸易能够进一步得到发展。
    去年下半年，中方某些贸易公司出现了不按合同履约的现象，日本商社方面有些抱怨，对此我们表示理解。去年我们的贸易进行了改革，把过去集中在中央的对外贸易权限下放到地方，下放到企业。从实施改革开放这样一个总的政策来说，这个改革无疑是正确的。但也出现了一些混乱现象，成立了众多的贸易公司，他们本身没有经营能力，也没有经营的知识，履约的条件很差，因此就发生了刚才我提到的这些现象。中国政府对于这些情况非常重视，我们已经采取了一些必要的措施进行整顿和治理。
    中国和日本经济方面的合作，除资金合作外，现在中日两国政府都支持成立一个投资促进会。投资促进会的建立将对日本企业来华投资起着良好的作用。我相信日本的经济界能够在促进对华投资方面起到更大作用，对此我们寄予希望。
    我们当然希望能够来中国办一些大型骨干企业，同时也欢迎来中国举办中小的企业。比较而言，中日在技术合作方面确实有一些进步，但是还不尽如人意。虽然事情已经过去，我们还是愿意提一提，就是东芝事件。这件事给中国带来一些不必要的损失。中国有句话，叫做“城门失火，殃及池鱼”。希望这样的事情不再发生。
    现在的世界的形势已发生了巨大的变化，维护和平和谋求发展已经成为当代的强大的潮流。中国执行独立自主的和平外交政策，愿意在和平共处五项原则的基础上和世界各国发展友好关系。中国和日本是一衣带水的邻邦，两国关系的发展不仅会对两国人民带来好处，而且对亚太地区，特别是世界和平都可以发挥积极的影响。在发展经济过程中可以互相补充。在平等互利的基础上建立一个长期稳定的关系，必将对中日两国的友好产生巨大的作用。
