Xushijie and Liangxiang Respond to Questions from Our Newspaper's Correspondent
Hainan Province One Year On: Infrastructure Improvements
Yanpu Development Zone's Paid Land Use Rights Bring Significant Investment

Today is the first anniversary of Hainan Province's establishment. How has Hainan fared? Recently, our correspondent interviewed Xushijie, Secretary of the Hainan Provincial Party Committee, and Liangxiang, Governor of Hainan Province.

Reporter: At the time of the province's establishment last year, Governor Liang had outlined the six-character policy of "development, reform, and foundation-laying" for the province's work. Could the Governor provide an introduction to the situation regarding energy, transportation, communications, water supply, and other infrastructure construction, which are of concern to the public?

Liangxiang: We can confidently say that energy construction has achieved leapfrog development. Last year, the province invested 250 million yuan in power generation, with four power generation units completed and put into operation, adding 150,000 kilowatts of installed capacity, bringing the province's total installed capacity to 532,000 kilowatts. The previously severe power supply issues that hindered industrial and agricultural production and people's normal lives have seen significant improvements. The province added 75.6 kilometers of new roads. The new Yanpu Port outer road was built, and the renovation of the road from Sanya to "Tianya Haijiao" was completed. The island's main trunk road was renovated, and some local roads were newly built. The renovation of the four major ports has begun in full swing. At the same time, four new air routes were opened, and the construction of the new Sanya Airport has started. Last year, the province added 7,000 new program-controlled telephones. 154 long-distance telephone lines and 4 long-distance telegraph lines were opened, and users in Haikou can now directly dial major cities across the country as well as Hong Kong and some international long-distance calls.

Reporter: Could the Governor discuss the situation regarding Hainan's foreign trade and the use of foreign capital?

Liangxiang: Last year, the province's total import and export value of foreign trade commodities was 771 million US dollars, with an export value of 281 million US dollars, an increase of 143% over the previous year. The province signed 463 foreign capital utilization projects, an increase of 1750% over the previous year. The agreed foreign capital utilization amount reached 382 million US dollars, an increase of 2710% over the previous year. The province's tourism foreign exchange earnings were 5759 million foreign exchange certificates, an increase of 40% over the previous year.

Reporter: May I ask a sensitive question regarding the development of the Yanpu area? Has the implementation of the Yanpu Development Zone violated the relevant regulations of the State Council?

Xushijie: The name "Yanpu" is probably still unfamiliar to many. Yanpu is located in the western part of the island in the county of Danzhou, a barren land covered with cacti, unsuitable for cultivation. However, Yanpu has a natural deep-water port and abundant reserves of oil and natural gas. Experts and scholars have calculated that to catch up with the advanced regions, Hainan will need to invest 200 billion yuan in the next 15 years. Given that the central government cannot allocate this huge sum and local accumulation is also insufficient, the central government has long pointed out: Hainan must implement the policy of "primarily attracting foreign capital." Attracting foreign capital to Hainan for large-scale development, allowing foreign investors involved in infrastructure construction to also engage in other projects, implementing unified planning and comprehensive compensation, is a practical and feasible new approach for Hainan, distinct from other economic zones.

Isn't it always said that we should conduct business according to international practices? According to international commercial and industrial practices, any economic entity of a country can purchase real estate in another country or region, with some having perpetual ownership and others requiring additional conditions.

Reporter: Does Hainan's Yanpu fall under perpetual ownership or does it have additional conditions?

Xushijie: The Yanpu Development Zone implements a paid transfer of land use rights, with the additional conditions simply expressed as "unified planning, large-scale development, phased implementation, and land following projects." What projects are developed in Yanpu must be subject to Chinese laws and approved by the Hainan Provincial Government. The rights obtained by foreign investors in the development zone are only the operational rights of the enterprise. All other sovereignty remains in our hands. At the same time, the Constitution clearly stipulates that the state can transfer land use rights for a fee, and the State Council has granted Hainan the authority to approve 70-year land use rights. The phrase "land following projects" means that under the premise of unified planning, land is transferred according to the actual needs of the project. The land price in Yanpu is reasonable; each mu of land brings in an investment of 220 million yuan in foreign exchange.

Reporter: Could you disclose the most troubling issue currently facing Hainan?

Xushijie: The issues that are causing concern are also highly valued by the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government. The main issues are: Hainan's implementation of the "small government, big society" system has been established within the province, but the government's functions have not fundamentally shifted from direct management to indirect management; the quality of the cadre team is still not up to the needs of construction; some departments have slow work, cumbersome procedures, and low efficiency; some cadres are involved in corruption; legal work is lagging behind the needs of the situation; science, education, culture, and health care are still quite backward. In the circulation sector, some units and individuals are engaged in illegal activities such as reselling approval documents, speculating on land, tax evasion, and tax avoidance; due to the influx of a large number of people and funds from outside the province, the floating population has increased rapidly, and social purchasing power has greatly increased, but Hainan's production and supply of living materials, especially the construction of grain and sideline product production bases, have not kept up, leading to a significant increase in Hainan's price levels last year. These issues include systemic ones, historical legacies, and shortcomings in government work. Hainan's establishment as a province is a precedent-setting endeavor. We believe that under the correct leadership of the Central Committee and the State Council, and through the joint efforts of the people of the entire province, we will be able to solve these problems and achieve new successes in reform, opening up, and economic construction.

    海南建省一年　基础设施改善    
    洋浦开发区土地使用权有偿转让带来可观投资
    本报海口４月２６日电  记者罗自苏报道：今天，是海南建省一周年。海南到底怎样了？记者日前访问了中共海南省委书记许士杰和省长梁湘。
    记者：去年建省之初，梁省长曾以“发展、改革、奠基”六个字作为全省工作的施政纲领。省长能否就世人关注的能源、交通、通讯、供水等基础设施建设情况作一介绍？
    梁湘：可以自信地说，能源建设得到超前发展。去年全省投资２．５亿元办电，有４台发电机组建成投产，新增装机容量１５万千瓦，使全省总装机容量达到５３．２万千瓦。曾经严重困扰工农业生产发展和人民正常生活的电力供应，有了明显的改善。全省新增公路通车７５．６公里。新建了洋浦港外公路，完成了三亚至“天涯海角”公路改造工程，改造了环岛主干线公路，新建了一些地方公路。四大港口的改造工程全面动工，同时，新辟空中航线４条，三亚新机场开始筹建。去年全省新增程控电话７０００门。开辟长途电话电路１５４条，长途电报电路４条，海口的用户实现了直拨全国各大中城市以及香港和部分国际长途电话。
    记者：省长可否谈谈海南的外贸、利用外资的情况？
    梁湘：去年，全省对外贸易商品进出口总额７．７１亿美元，其中出口总值２．８１亿美元，比上年增长１．４３倍。全省利用外资签约４６３项，比上年增长１７．５倍。协议规定利用外资额达３．８２亿美元，比上年增长２７．１倍。全省旅游外汇收入５７５９万元外汇券，比上年增长４０％。
    记者：请允许我提一个敏感的问题，即洋浦地区的开发问题。洋浦开发区在具体实施中是否违背了国务院的有关规定？
    许士杰：“洋浦”这个地名恐怕还鲜为人知。洋浦地处海南西北部的儋县，是遍地仙人掌的一片荒地，不宜种植。但洋浦有天然良港，有储量丰富的石油天然气。专家学者们测算过，海南要赶上先进地区，近１５年内需要投入２０００亿元，鉴于中央不可能拨出这笔巨资，靠地方积累也不可能。因此，中央早就指出：海南要实行以“引进外资为主”的方针。吸引外资在海南搞成片承包开发，对那些搞基础设施建设的外商应允许兼搞别的项目，实行统一规划，综合补偿，这是海南有别于其它经济特区的切实可行的新路子。
    不是总说要按国际惯例办事吗？按国际间商贸办实业的惯例，任何一个国家的经济实体均可以到别的国家或地区购置地产，有些可有永久所有权、有些则需附加条件。
    记者：海南的洋浦属于永久性出让呢，还是有附加条件呢？
    许士杰：洋浦开发区实行的是土地使用权的有偿转让，其附加条件可以这样简明扼要地表达：叫“统一规划、成片开发、分期实施、以项目带土地”。在洋浦搞什么项目，要受到中国法律的制约，要经过海南省政府的批准。外商在开发区内取得的权利只是获得企业的经营权。其它所有的主权均在我们手中。同时，国家的宪法明文规定，国家土地使用权可以有偿转让，国务院也给了海南有批准使用权７０年的权限。所谓“以项目带土地”就是在统一规划的前提下，按项目的实际需要转让一定数额的土地。洋浦的地价是合算的，它每亩地带来的投资将达到外汇人民币２２０万元。
    记者：能否披露目前海南最感困扰问题？
    许士杰：感到困扰的问题，也是省委、省府所高度重视的问题，主要是：海南所实施的“小政府、大社会”体制已经在省内确定、但政府职能还没有从直接管理向间接管理作根本转变；干部队伍的素质还不能适应建设的需要；一些部门工作拖拉、手续繁杂、效率很低；一些干部中存在行贿受贿的腐败现象；法制工作尚跟不上形势发展的需要；科学、教育、文化、卫生事业仍然相当落后。在流通领域中，少数单位和个人倒卖批文、炒卖土地、偷税、漏税等违法违纪现象还存在；由于省外大量人员、资金涌入海南、流动人口猛增、社会购买力大大提高，但海南的生活资料生产和供应，特别是粮食生产和副食品生产基地建设跟不上，使得去年海南的物价上涨幅度过大。这些问题有体制上的，有历史遗留下来的，也有政府工作中的缺点造成的。海南省办大区是前无古人的事业，我们相信，在中央和国务院的正确领导下，经过全省人民的共同努力，我们完全有能力解决这些问题，取得改革、开放和经济建设的新成就。
