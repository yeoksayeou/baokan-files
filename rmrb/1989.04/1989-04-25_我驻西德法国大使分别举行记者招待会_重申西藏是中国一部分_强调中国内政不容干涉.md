Chinese Ambassadors to West Germany and France Hold Press Conferences
Reaffirm Tibet as Part of China
Emphasize Non-Interference in China's Internal Affairs

BEIJING, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Germany, Mei Zhao Rong, held a press conference at the Chinese Embassy in Bonn yesterday afternoon. He stated that all matters concerning Tibet are China's internal affairs, and that foreign governments, organizations, and individuals have no right to interfere. Any attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs under the guise of "human rights" and to separate Tibet from China is doomed to fail.

On April 20 and 21, a so-called "Tibet and Human Rights" international hearing was held in a meeting room of a parliamentary group in the West German Federal Parliament. This event was organized by West German Green Party MP Petra Kelly and retired general Gunter Bastian. The hearing invited representatives of the so-called Tibetan government-in-exile and some individuals with ulterior motives from abroad. They blatantly interfered in China's internal affairs and openly advocated that "Tibet should never accept the theory that 'Tibet is an inseparable part of China' and should become a member of the international community in the 21st century." At the end of the meeting, a so-called "Bonn Declaration" was passed. Former West German Ambassador to China, Victor, upon hearing the news, attended the meeting and sternly refuted the lies about China's "massacre" in Tibet, pointing out that "Tibet belongs to China just as Georgia belongs to the Soviet Union." No country in the world supports the so-called Tibetan government-in-exile's advocacy for Tibetan independence.

At the beginning of the press conference, Ambassador Mei read a statement expressing strong indignation and regret at the hearing's blatant interference in China's internal affairs.

The statement said that some people have been making a fuss about the so-called "Tibet human rights" issue, which is entirely futile. Those who talk about human rights abroad and are unwilling to give up their past privileges of ruling over serfs are trying to create disturbances and rely on foreign forces to separate Tibet from the motherland, in order to restore their former "paradise." This is the essence of the so-called Tibet issue.

The statement said that the Chinese government's attitude towards negotiations with the Dalai Lama is consistent and clear. That is, as long as the Dalai Lama gives up his activities of seeking "independence," is willing to maintain the unity of the motherland and promote national unity, and contribute to the construction of Tibet, we are willing to negotiate with him. Negotiations are a matter between the central government and the Dalai Lama, purely an internal affair of China, and do not allow any foreign government, organization, or individual to interfere.

PARIS, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to France, Zhou Jue, today held a press conference in Paris, sternly pointing out that the Dalai Lama's demand to send a so-called "international investigation team" to Tibet is extremely absurd, and the Chinese government firmly opposes it. He said that Tibet's affairs are purely China's internal affairs, and no foreigner has the right to interfere.

A few days ago, the Dalai Lama conducted activities to split the motherland in Strasbourg and Paris. Some French officials and individuals of status received the Dalai Lama. This situation has caused dissatisfaction among the Chinese people and all foreign individuals with a sense of justice. Ambassador Zhou held a press conference in Paris for this reason.

Before answering reporters' questions, Ambassador Zhou said that it is well known that since the 13th century, Tibet has been part of Chinese territory, which is universally recognized by countries around the world. The Dalai Lama's activities in France are no longer religious activities but are attempts to split the motherland and openly demand the internationalization of the Tibet issue. The Chinese government firmly opposes this and cannot but remain vigilant.

A reporter asked if the ambassador's remarks involved President Mitterrand's wife meeting with the Dalai Lama. Ambassador Zhou replied that before the meeting, the Chinese Embassy had conducted several serious exchanges with the French side. The reception of the Dalai Lama by some high-ranking French individuals and the related news from French media have hurt the feelings of the Chinese people, and we cannot but express regret. He said that we have not done and will not do anything harmful to the relationship between the two countries. At the same time, China hopes that the French side will not let such incidents happen again and will not do anything that hurts the feelings of the two peoples and harms the relationship between the two countries. The ambassador sternly pointed out that the Chinese government's position is clear: it firmly opposes any attempt to send a so-called "international investigation team" to Tibet. Tibet's affairs are China's internal affairs, and no foreign government, organization, or individual is allowed to interfere.

　　我驻西德法国大使分别举行记者招待会    
    重申西藏是中国一部分    
    强调中国内政不容干涉
    本报波恩４月２５日电  记者江建国报道：中国驻联邦德国大使梅兆荣昨天下午在大使馆举行的记者招待会上说，一切有关西藏的事务都是中国内政，外国政府、组织和个人无权干涉。任何打着维护“人权”的幌子，干涉中国内政，把西藏从中国版图分裂出去的企图，都是注定要失败的。
    ４月２０日和２１日两天，由西德绿党女议员佩特拉·凯利和退役将军盖尔德·巴斯蒂安一手策划，在西德联邦议院某议会党团的会议厅里，举行了一个所谓的“西藏与人权”国际听证会。这个听证会邀请了所谓的西藏流亡政府代表和国际上一些别有用心的人士，露骨地干涉中国内政，公然叫嚣“永远不接受‘西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分’的理论”，“要让西藏在２１世纪成为国际大家庭的一员。”会议结束时还通过一纸所谓的《波恩宣言》。西德前驻华大使维克特闻讯赴会，义正词严地批驳中国在西藏进行“大屠杀”的谎言，指出“西藏属于中国犹如格鲁吉亚属于苏联”，世界上没有任何一个国家赞同所谓的西藏流亡政府鼓动西藏独立的主张。
    梅兆荣大使在记者招待会开始时宣读一份声明，对这个听证会粗暴干涉中国内政，表示强烈的愤慨和遗憾。
    声明说，一些人就所谓“西藏人权”问题大作文章，这完全是徒劳的。那些在国外侈谈人权的分裂主义分子不甘心失去他们过去骑在农奴头上作威作福的特殊地位，企图通过制造骚乱和借助外国势力，把西藏从祖国分裂出去，以恢复他们昔日的“天堂”，这就是他们所谓的西藏问题的实质。
    声明说，中国政府对于同达赖喇嘛谈判问题的态度是一贯和明确的。这就是：只要达赖喇嘛放弃搞“独立”活动，愿意维护祖国统一和增进民族团结，为建设西藏作出贡献，我们就愿同他谈判。谈判是中央政府同达赖之间的事，纯属中国内政，不允许任何外国政府、组织或个人插手。
    本报巴黎４月２５日电　记者张启华报道：我国驻法大使周觉今天在记者招待会上严正指出，达赖喇嘛提出的派所谓“国际调查团”去西藏的要求是极其荒谬的，中国政府坚决反对。他说，西藏的事务纯系中国内政，任何外国人无权干涉。
    几天前，达赖喇嘛曾在斯特拉斯堡和巴黎进行分裂祖国活动。法国一些有身份的、官方背景的人士接见了达赖。这一事态引起了中国人民和一切怀有正义感的外国人士的不满。周觉大使为此在巴黎举行了记者招待会。
    周大使在回答记者提问前说，众所周知，从１３世纪起，西藏就是中国领土的一部份，这是世界上各国都普遍承认的。达赖喇嘛在法国的活动，已不是宗教活动，而是企图分裂祖国、公开要求把西藏问题国际化的政治活动。中国政府对此表示坚决反对，并不能不保持警惕。
    有记者问，大使的这番评论是否涉及密特朗总统夫人会见达赖喇嘛？周大使回答说，事前，中国大使馆曾同法方进行多次严正的交涉。法国一些高级身份人士对达赖喇嘛的接见，和从法国新闻媒介发表的有关消息看，它伤害了中国人民的感情，我们对此不能不表示遗憾。他说，我们过去没有，今后也不做有损两国关系的事情。同时，中国也希望法方不要再让这类事件重新出现，不要做伤害两国人民感情和有损两国关系的事情。大使严正指出，中国政府的立场很清楚，坚决反对任何派遣所谓“国际调查团”去西藏的企图。西藏的事务是中国的内政，任何外国政府、组织、个人都不得干预。
