Israel Orders Eviction of Palestinian Residents from "Security Zone"

	Shamir's Election Proposal Gains Cabinet Support

	BEIRUT, April 17 (Xinhua) — According to reports received here, Israel today ordered the evacuation of the Shaba region in southern Lebanon's "security zone."

	Under this directive, more than 500 Palestinian farmers in the Shaba region will be affected. They will be forced to sell their 1,500 hectares of land and 100 houses to the Israeli occupation authorities within 10 days, or face confiscation.

	In 1982, Israeli forces invaded Lebanon and, after withdrawing in 1985, unilaterally established a "security zone" in the south to prevent Palestinian guerrillas from infiltrating Israeli territory from southern Lebanon.

	AMMAN, April 17 (Xinhua) — JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Shamir's four-point proposal for elections with preconditions in the occupied territories received broad support during the cabinet meeting on April 16.

	Defense Minister Rabin and several other ministers were the first to express support for this proposal. However, two right-wing ministers from the Likud bloc believe that the proposal will only "legitimize" candidates from the PLO.

	Shamir presented this proposal to the cabinet after returning from his visit to the United States last week. U.S. President Bush cautiously supported Shamir's proposal.

　　以驱逐“安全带”巴勒斯坦居民
　　沙米尔的选举建议获内阁支持
    新华社贝鲁特４月１７日电　据此间收到的消息说，以色列今天下令撤空黎巴嫩南部“安全带”的沙巴地区。
    根据这项命令，在沙巴地区务农的５００多名巴勒斯坦人将受到影响。他们将被迫在１０天内把他们的１５００公顷土地和１００幢房屋卖给以色列占领当局，否则将被没收。
    １９８２年，以军侵入黎巴嫩，并于１９８５年撤军后在南部地区单方面划出“安全带”，以防止巴勒斯坦游击队从黎巴嫩南部潜入以色列领土。
    新华社安曼４月１７日电　耶路撒冷消息：以色列总理沙米尔提出的关于在被占领土上举行有先决条件选举的４点建议在１６日内阁会议上得到广泛的支持。
    国防部长拉宾为首的几位部长率先对这个建议表示支持。但是有两名利库德集团的右翼部长认为该建议只会使巴解组织的候选人“合法化”。
    沙米尔是上周访美回来后向内阁提出这一建议的。美国总统布什对沙米尔的此项建议表示了谨慎的支持。
