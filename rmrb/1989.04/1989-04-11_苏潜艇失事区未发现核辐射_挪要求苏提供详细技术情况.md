The Soviet submarine accident area has not shown any signs of nuclear radiation. Norway demands that the Soviet Union provide detailed technical information.

	STOCKHOLM, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A Norwegian defense official said today that after the Soviet nuclear submarine caught fire and sank in the Norwegian Sea on April 7, the Norwegian defense department immediately dispatched two reconnaissance aircraft to the accident area for monitoring. Norwegian experts have analyzed the samples obtained so far and have not found any abnormal nuclear radiation phenomena.

	According to reports, Soviet leader Gorbachev informed Norwegian Prime Minister Brundtland of the accident on April 8, mentioning that the submarine had shut down its two nuclear reactors before sinking. The submarine was only carrying two nuclear torpedoes and no other nuclear weapons. He also stated that according to Soviet experts' judgment, the submarine at a depth of 2,000 meters of seawater would not cause nuclear proliferation or nuclear radiation.

	STOCKHOLM, April 10 (Xinhua) -- The Norwegian Foreign Ministry today formally requested the Soviet Union to provide detailed technical information about the nuclear submarine that sank last Friday.

	It is reported that the Norwegian Foreign Ministry has put forward 10 questions to the Soviet Union, including what type of cooling equipment the nuclear submarine uses, how much nuclear waste it produces, the strength of the protective layers of the two nuclear reactors and two nuclear torpedoes, and the effective period of the reactors.

	Since the accident site of the nuclear submarine is located in the rich fishing grounds of the Norwegian Sea, the Norwegian authorities are concerned that it may pose a "threat to several generations" for the fishing industry in this region, and "over time, it may cause the leakage of radioactive substances from the reactors."

　　苏潜艇失事区未发现核辐射
　　挪要求苏提供详细技术情况
    本报斯德哥尔摩４月９日电　记者顾耀铭报道：据挪威国防部官员今天介绍，苏联核潜艇７日在挪威北部公海着火沉没后，挪威国防部立即派出两架侦察机到失事区监测。挪威专家从已得到的样品分析，尚未发现有核辐射异常现象。
    据报道，苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫于８日向挪威首相布伦特兰夫人通报了事故发生的情况，其中谈到该潜艇在沉没前已将两个核反应堆关闭，船上只装有两枚核鱼雷，没有装载其他核武器，并表示据苏联专家判断，该潜艇在２０００米海水深处不可能发生核扩散或核辐射。
    本报斯德哥尔摩４月１０日电　记者顾耀铭报道：挪威外交部今天正式向苏联要求提供上星期五沉没的核潜艇的详细技术情况。
    据介绍，挪威外交部向苏联提出了１０个问题，其中包括这艘核潜艇使用什么类型的冷却设备，产生多少核废料，两个核反应堆和两个核鱼雷的保护层的强度，以及反应堆的有效期等。
    由于这艘核潜艇出事地点正位于挪威海丰富的渔业资源区，挪威当局担心，它将会对这个地区的渔业生产造成“几代人的威胁”，“随着时间的推移，将有可能使反应堆放射物泄漏”。
