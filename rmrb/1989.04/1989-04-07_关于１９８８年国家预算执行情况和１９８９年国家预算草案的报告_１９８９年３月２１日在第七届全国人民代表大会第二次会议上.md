Report on the Execution of the 1988 National Budget and the 1989 National Budget Draft
— March 21, 1989, at the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress

Vice Premier and Minister of Finance Wang Bingqian:

Comrades and Deputies,

I am presenting the report on the execution of the 1988 national budget and the draft of the 1989 national budget on behalf of the State Council. Please review it.

I. Execution of the 1988 National Budget

In 1988, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, through the joint efforts of various levels of people's governments and all ethnic groups across the country, reform and construction made new progress. Social production continued to grow, and the work of rectifying the economic environment and economic order began to show results. On this basis, the state budget revenue exceeded the target, and the financial supply basically guaranteed the needs of reform, construction, and development. Overall, the execution of the state budget was relatively good.

According to the current estimates, the total national fiscal revenue for 1988 was 258.782 billion yuan, and the total national fiscal expenditure was 266.831 billion yuan. After deducting revenue from expenditure, the fiscal deficit was 8.049 billion yuan. These estimated figures may change slightly after the final national audit is completed, but it is estimated that the deficit amount will not exceed the budget.

Of the above total national fiscal revenue, domestic fiscal revenue was 245.782 billion yuan, completing 101.3% of the budget; foreign loan revenue was 13 billion yuan, completing 101.6% of the budget. The completion situation of various major domestic fiscal revenues was as follows: total tax revenue was 237.58 billion yuan, completing 101.8% of the budget; enterprise revenue was 4.866 billion yuan, completing 106.5% of the budget; domestic debt revenue was 13.101 billion yuan, completing 100.8% of the budget; revenue from the collection of energy and transportation key construction funds was 18.359 billion yuan, completing 101.6% of the budget; other revenues totaled 16.459 billion yuan, completing 115.3% of the budget. In addition, this year, 44.583 billion yuan was allocated for enterprise loss subsidies, which was handled as a deduction from fiscal revenue and has already been deducted from the total revenue.

In the 1988 total national fiscal expenditure, the expenditure arranged with domestic funds was 253.831 billion yuan, completing 101.2% of the budget; the expenditure arranged with foreign loans was 13 billion yuan, completing 101.6% of the budget. The completion situation of various major expenditures was as follows: basic construction expenditure was 61.949 billion yuan, completing 97.6% of the budget; funds for potential improvement and new product trials were 14.333 billion yuan, completing 117.4% of the budget; expenditure for supporting rural production and various agricultural undertakings was 15.51 billion yuan, completing 100.9% of the budget; urban maintenance and construction expenditure was 10.094 billion yuan, completing 113.8% of the budget; expenditure for cultural, educational, scientific, and health undertakings was 47.907 billion yuan, completing 107.2% of the budget; national defense expenditure was 21.796 billion yuan, completing 101.3% of the budget; administrative management expenditure was 22.107 billion yuan, completing 122.4% of the budget; price subsidy expenditure was 31.695 billion yuan, completing 88.5% of the budget. In addition, domestic debt repayment and interest expenditure was 3.417 billion yuan, and foreign loan repayment and interest expenditure was 4.264 billion yuan.

During the execution of the 1988 budget, the state finance faced many difficulties and contradictions. The most prominent problem in the economic life this year was that due to overheating and excessive demand, there was obvious inflation, and the price increase was too large. Reflected in the finance, the contradiction between the supply and demand of funds was prominent, and the financial situation was severe. The Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Party, held in September last year, correctly analyzed the economic situation and proposed the policy of "rectifying the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and deepening the reform comprehensively." Over the past few months, the State Council has taken a series of measures in conjunction with the rectification and rectification work. Various levels of people's governments and relevant departments have done a lot of work in suppressing demand, adjusting the structure, opening up financial sources, increasing revenue, controlling expenditure, and strengthening management, and have achieved good results.

(1) Developing production, opening up financial sources, and exceeding the fiscal revenue target. Various regions and departments, centering on the "increase production and reduce expenditure, increase revenue and reduce expenditure" campaign, worked hard to increase the production of marketable products, improve product quality, reduce energy and raw material consumption, reduce inventory backlog, expand commodity circulation, and production has developed. At the same time, various levels of financial and tax departments conscientiously implemented the "Urgent Notice of the State Council on Strengthening Tax Work and Ensuring State Fiscal Revenue," insisted on rule-based taxation, rectified tax exemptions, strengthened tax collection and management, and did a good job in the new tax collection work, making the industrial and commercial tax revenue exceed the target. On the basis of continuous production development and strengthened revenue organization, this year's domestic fiscal revenue exceeded the budget target, and increased by 19.5 billion yuan compared with last year, an increase of 8.6%, basically realizing increased production and increased revenue.

(2) Ensuring key areas, increasing investment in energy, transportation, agriculture, and intellectual resources. The 1988 budgeted basic construction expenditure was controlled according to the state budget, and the execution result did not exceed the budget, which was basically the same as last year, but the investment structure was adjusted accordingly. According to statistics, of the 32.685 billion yuan in basic construction "loan instead of allocation" investment, 15.851 billion yuan was used for key construction and infrastructure in energy, transportation, communications, raw materials, etc., accounting for about 50% of the total investment, which will play a positive role in easing the tension in energy, transportation, communications, and raw materials. At the same time, in the face of the relatively tense situation of financial supply and demand, various levels of finance still increased investment in agriculture and intellectual resources. This year, the expenditure for supporting rural production and various agricultural undertakings was 15.51 billion yuan, an increase of 15.6% over last year. If the 2.6 billion yuan in the state budget for supporting the development of agricultural production in poor areas is added, the total is 18.1 billion yuan. This year, the expenditure for cultural, educational, scientific, and health undertakings was 47.907 billion yuan, an increase of 18.9% over last year, of which the expenditure for educational undertakings was 27.126 billion yuan, an increase of 19.7%, exceeding the growth rate of regular fiscal revenue. In addition, the state budget's other expenditure items for education had 5.23 billion yuan in funds and construction investment. Of course, the current intellectual investment cannot meet the needs of the development of undertakings, and in the future, with the increase of state fiscal revenue, the expenditure in this area will continue to increase.

(3) Further promoting the reform of the financial management system, mobilizing the enthusiasm of local governments to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. In improving the financial management system, two main aspects of work were focused on. First, 13 local taxes with relatively scattered tax sources, such as property tax, slaughter tax, livestock transaction tax, market transaction tax, vehicle and vessel usage tax, individual industrial and commercial household income tax, individual income tax, individual income adjustment tax, agricultural and forestry special product tax, deed tax, etc., were transferred to local management, and the increased part of the revenue was all retained for local use. Second, for 17 provinces, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and municipalities with independent planning status, such as Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Liaoning, Shenyang, Dalian, Harbin, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Qingdao, Ningbo, Henan, Hunan, Guangdong, Wuhan, Chongqing, etc., with relatively large revenue remittance ratios, various forms of financial contracting methods were implemented. These two reforms played a role in mobilizing local enthusiasm, promoting economic development in various places, tapping potential, opening up financial sources, increasing revenue, and controlling expenditure. According to statistics, the 13 local taxes transferred to local management this year totaled 9.21 billion yuan, an increase of 32.3% over last year; after the 17 revenue remittance areas implemented the financial contracting method, except for a few areas, the revenue in most areas increased to varying degrees, of which 5 areas had an increase of more than 14%.

(4) Strictly controlling the purchasing power of social groups and conducting comprehensive tax, financial, and price inspections. In accordance with the requirements of rectifying the economic environment and rectifying the economic order, the State Council issued the "Decision on Strictly Controlling the Purchasing Power of Social Groups" and the "Notice on Conducting Comprehensive Tax, Financial, and Price Inspections." Various regions and departments conscientiously implemented the relevant decisions of the State Council and took these two items of work as important measures for rectifying the economic environment and rectifying the economic order, strengthened leadership, organized forces, and did a lot of work, achieving initial results. According to the National Office for Controlling the Purchasing Power of Social Groups, the purchasing power of social groups at the county level and above nationwide in 1988 increased by 1.8% over last year, of which the special control commodities decreased by 9.1% over last year, and the momentum of the rapid increase in the purchasing power of social groups was initially controlled. In the comprehensive tax, financial, and price inspections, various regions and departments, based on the self-inspection of enterprises, sent more than 130,000 inspection teams and 590,000 inspectors to conduct key inspections in enterprises and units. Not only were financial discipline and certain improper practices rectified, but also a portion of the financial funds were cleaned up and recovered. By the end of last December, a total of 6.44 billion yuan in funds that should be remitted to the finance was found, of which 4.22 billion yuan had been remitted.

While affirming that the execution of the national budget is relatively good, we must not overlook the difficulties and problems facing the national finance. First, the national finance has had a deficit for several consecutive years, and in the past two years, not only has the central finance had a deficit, but some regions have also had deficits, especially the financial difficulties at the county level are relatively large. The inability of the finance to cover expenditures and the occurrence of deficits are one of the factors causing inflation, which has had an adverse impact on economic stability and people's lives and is not conducive to the continued deepening of the reform. In the future, whether it is the central finance or the local finance, we must take decisive measures to gradually eliminate the deficit and achieve a balance between revenue and expenditure. Second, the economic benefits of enterprises are not high, and the phenomena of low product quality, high material consumption, and high cost are quite common; the loss-making area of enterprises is expanding, and the loss amount is increasing, plus the enterprise contracting method is not yet perfect, which greatly restricts the growth of fiscal revenue. At the same time, due to the excessive tax reduction and profit sharing in recent years, the control of fixed asset investment has been lost, the amount of loan repayment before tax has increased sharply, the funds are too scattered, and the proportion of fiscal revenue in national income has decreased from 31.9% in 1979 to 19% in 1988. In this way, it is difficult to concentrate financial strength to guarantee the key needs of reform and construction. Third, due to lax supervision and management, the budget constraint is weakened, and combined with the weak legal awareness of the people, there are serious phenomena of tax evasion, profit retention, fund transfer, and waste such as entertaining guests, business trips, and public expenses. We have not fully recognized these problems in the past, and we have not studied them enough, especially we have not well played the role of financial macro-control and supervision, which is a problem that needs to be seriously summarized and gradually improved.

II. Draft of the 1989 National Budget

According to the central government's requirements to focus on rectifying the economic environment and rectifying the economic order in the next two years, the main principle of the 1989 national budget arrangement is: while appropriately concentrating funds and increasing fiscal revenue, we must resolutely implement a tight fiscal policy, suppress the demand for funds, reduce fiscal expenditure, and control the fiscal deficit. Implementing a tight fiscal policy is an important part of rectifying the economic environment and rectifying the economic order, and in essence, it is an adjustment of the fiscal distribution structure. In the adjustment, we must have both gains and losses, both guarantees and pressures, and we must treat different aspects differently, and all aspects must tighten their belts.

The 1989 national budget draft submitted for review has a total fiscal revenue of 285.68 billion yuan, an increase of 10.4% over the estimated execution amount of last year; the total fiscal expenditure is 293.08 billion yuan, an increase of 9.8% over the estimated execution amount of last year; after deducting revenue from expenditure, the expenditure exceeds the revenue by 7.4 billion yuan, a reduction of 6.49 billion yuan in the deficit compared to last year.

Of the above total national budget revenue, domestic fiscal revenue is 269.18 billion yuan, and foreign loan revenue is 16.5 billion yuan. The arrangement situation of the main items of domestic fiscal revenue is as follows: total tax revenue is 255.714 billion yuan, enterprise revenue is 4.004 billion yuan, revenue from the collection of energy and transportation key construction funds is 20.5 billion yuan, special revenue is 5.28 billion yuan, national budget adjustment fund revenue is 12 billion yuan, domestic debt revenue is 11.1 billion yuan, and other revenues total 12.73 billion yuan. In addition, enterprise loss subsidies total 52.148 billion yuan, which are still handled as deductions from revenue and have already been deducted from domestic fiscal revenue.

In the 1989 national budget total expenditure, the expenditure arranged with domestic funds is 276.58 billion yuan, and the expenditure arranged with foreign loans is 16.5 billion yuan. The arrangement situation of various major expenditures is as follows: basic construction expenditure is 62.792 billion yuan, enterprise potential improvement and new product trial funds are 12.583 billion yuan, expenditure for supporting rural production and various agricultural undertakings is 17.396 billion yuan, urban maintenance and construction expenditure is 10.3 billion yuan, expenditure for cultural, educational, scientific, and health undertakings is 51.388 billion yuan, national defense expenditure is 24.55 billion yuan, administrative management expenditure is 22.664 billion yuan, price subsidy expenditure is 40.969 billion yuan, domestic debt repayment and interest expenditure is 2.548 billion yuan, foreign loan repayment and interest expenditure is 7.02 billion yuan, and the increased expenditure for adjusting the wages of administrative and public institutions is 3.5 billion yuan. In addition, the total reserve fund is 2.5 billion yuan, of which the central reserve fund is 1 billion yuan, and the local reserve fund is 1.5 billion yuan.

According to the suggestions of many deputies to the National People's Congress, the State Council decided to make necessary improvements to the method of compiling the national budget starting from 1989, that is, to compile the central budget and local budgets separately while compiling the national budget. The national budget draft and the central budget draft submitted for review by the Congress will be executed after being reviewed and approved by the Congress; the local budget will be compiled in detail by various levels of people's governments according to the revenue and expenditure indicators determined by the State Council, and then submitted to the local people's congresses at various levels for review and approval.

The central budget revenue for 1989 is 166.775 billion yuan, and the expenditure is 174.175 billion yuan. After deducting revenue from expenditure, the expenditure exceeds the revenue by 7.4 billion yuan.

In the central budget revenue, the central revenue is 122.254 billion yuan, and the revenue remitted from the local areas is 44.521 billion yuan. The arrangement situation of the main items of the central revenue is as follows: total tax revenue is 73.659 billion yuan, enterprise revenue is 2.774 billion yuan, revenue from the collection of energy and transportation key construction funds is 16.783 billion yuan, special revenue is 5.28 billion yuan, national budget adjustment fund revenue is 7.8 billion yuan, domestic debt revenue is 11.1 billion yuan, and foreign loan revenue is 16.5 billion yuan. In addition, enterprise loss subsidies total 19.992 billion yuan, which are handled as deductions from revenue and have already been deducted from the revenue.

In the central budget expenditure, the central expenditure is 118.07 billion yuan, and the subsidy expenditure to local areas is 56.105 billion yuan. The arrangement situation of the main items of the central expenditure is as follows: basic construction expenditure is 49.162 billion yuan, potential improvement and new product trial funds are 5.077 billion yuan, geological exploration funds are 3.39 billion yuan, expenditure for supporting rural production and various agricultural undertakings is 2.035 billion yuan, expenditure for cultural, educational, scientific, and health undertakings is 6.607 billion yuan, national defense expenditure is 24.33 billion yuan, administrative management expenditure is 2.17 billion yuan, domestic debt repayment and interest expenditure is 2.548 billion yuan, foreign loan repayment and interest expenditure is 7.02 billion yuan, price subsidy expenditure is 5.507 billion yuan, increased expenditure for adjusting the wages of administrative and public institutions is 1.096 billion yuan, and the central reserve fund is 1 billion yuan.

The revenue and expenditure indicators for local budgets determined by the State Council for 1989 are: revenue is 219.531 billion yuan, and expenditure is 219.531 billion yuan, achieving a balance between revenue and expenditure. In the local budget revenue, the revenue organized by the local areas is 163.426 billion yuan, and the subsidy revenue from the central government is 56.105 billion yuan. In the local budget expenditure, the local expenditure is 175.01 billion yuan, and the expenditure remitted to the central government is 44.521 billion yuan. This is a summary of the national accounts, and specific to each region, some regions may have surpluses, and some regions may have deficits, with many difficulties. Therefore, the State Council requires various levels of local people's governments to strictly calculate and compile the local budget according to the fiscal revenue and expenditure indicators determined by the state, and to take effective measures to increase revenue, control expenditure, and strive to achieve a balance between revenue and expenditure, without drawing up a deficit budget.

The above national budget draft is calculated based on the requirements of the national economic and social development plan for this year, and also considers the factors of price and wage reforms and the adjustment of bank interest rates affecting the reduction of fiscal revenue and the increase of expenditure, and the amount of fiscal revenue and expenditure that can be increased by policy measures. Here, I will emphasize the following points:

(1) Regarding the appropriate concentration of funds. In recent years, the growth of extra-budgetary funds has been very fast, and it is estimated that it will reach 227 billion yuan in 1988, an increase of four times over 4.53 billion yuan in 1979, while the growth of budgetary funds has been slow and cannot guarantee the needs of reform and construction. In order to change the current situation of financial funds being too scattered, gradually increase the proportion of fiscal revenue in national income, and enhance the ability of financial macro-control, the State Council decided that starting from 1989, the national budget adjustment fund will be levied at a rate of 10% on all extra-budgetary funds of state-owned enterprises and institutions, government agencies, troops, and local governments, as well as the profits of urban and township collective enterprises, private enterprises, and individual industrial and commercial households after paying income tax. It is estimated that approximately 12 billion yuan can be collected annually. At the same time, in order to adjust production and consumption and open up new financial sources, the State Council also decided that this year, special consumption taxes will be levied on color televisions and small cars; the scope of agricultural and forestry special product taxes will be expanded, and the tax rate will be appropriately increased; the tax rate and collection method of the construction tax levied on self-raised basic construction investment will be appropriately adjusted; the product tax and value-added tax levied by customs on imported products will be changed to be levied according to the actual exchange rate, and other measures to increase revenue, with a total estimated increase of approximately 13.1 billion yuan.

(2) Regarding the increase in agricultural investment. Agricultural production plays a huge role in promoting and restricting the entire national economy and is the foundation for increasing effective supply, suppressing inflation, and stabilizing the economy. In order to ensure that agricultural production, especially grain, cotton, and oilseed production, will have a significant increase this year, the state finance has increased investment in agriculture. The 1989 national budget arranges 17.396 billion yuan for supporting rural production and various agricultural undertakings, an increase of 1.886 billion yuan over the estimated execution amount of last year, an increase of 12.2%, and the central and local finances also arrange various poverty alleviation funds totaling 2.9 billion yuan, an increase of 300 million yuan over last year. At the same time, the State Council decided that this year, the contract purchase price of grain and oil will be appropriately increased, the purchase price of cotton will be increased, and the state-planned purchase of grain will be changed to market price purchase, and the finance will need to increase subsidies by nearly 9 billion yuan, which can correspondingly increase farmers' income.

(3) Regarding the increase in intellectual investment. In recent years, the expenditure for cultural, educational, scientific, and health undertakings has grown rapidly. From 1979 to 1988, the average annual growth rate was 15.6%, of which the growth rate of educational undertakings was 15.3%, far exceeding the growth rate of regular fiscal revenue in the same period. The 1989 national budget arranges 51.388 billion yuan for cultural, educational, scientific, and health undertakings, an increase of 3.481 billion yuan over the estimated execution amount of last year, an increase of 7.3%, of which the expenditure for educational undertakings is 29.864 billion yuan, an increase of 2.738 billion yuan over the estimated execution amount of last year, an increase of 10.1%. In addition, the state budget's other expenditure items for education have 6.536 billion yuan in funds and construction investment, an increase of 1.3 billion yuan over last year; the adjustment of wages and other educational subsidies will increase by 1 billion yuan. The above total increase is 5 billion yuan. In the face of the financial difficulties and the tightening of various expenditures, the state has made every effort to arrange this. At the same time, we also require that various levels of government and departments, in the budget execution, through efforts to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, tap potential, and increase some educational funds as much as possible.

(4) Regarding the adjustment of bank interest rates and the implementation of savings deposit preservation. In order to stabilize finance, increase urban and rural residents' savings deposits, control various loans, and reduce currency issuance, the State Council decided that starting from September last year, the deposit and loan interest rates will be increased by 1 percentage point, and the preservation of savings deposits for 3 years or more will be implemented; starting from February 1 this year, the average interest rate of urban and rural residents' and enterprise and institutional fixed-term deposits will be increased by 3.06 percentage points, and the average interest rate of various loans will be increased by 2.34 percentage points. The implementation of these measures will cost the state a lot. It is estimated that due to the adjustment of bank interest rates and the implementation of the preservation of savings deposits for 3 years or more, the financial revenue will be reduced by approximately 900 million yuan, which has been arranged in the national budget.

(5) Regarding the adjustment of workers' wages. In order to further mobilize the enthusiasm of workers, solve the difficulties in workers' lives caused by price increases, and appropriately solve some prominent unreasonable problems in wage relations, the State Council decided that at an appropriate time this year, the wages of administrative and public institution workers will be increased, the living allowance subsidies for retired and retired workers of administrative and public institutions and state-owned enterprises will be increased, and some prominent unreasonable problems in wage relations will be appropriately solved; at the same time, the method of linking wages with economic benefits will be generally implemented in state-owned enterprises, mainly through improving economic benefits to increase workers' wages. The implementation of the above measures will require the state to reduce revenue and increase expenditure by approximately 5.5 billion yuan, of which the reduction of revenue is 2 billion yuan, which has been listed in the relevant revenue items; the increase of expenditure is 3.5 billion yuan, which has been separately listed in the national budget expenditure, and will be listed in the relevant items after the measures are implemented.

(6) Regarding the strict control of fiscal expenditure. In recent years, the growth of fiscal expenditure has been relatively fast, exceeding the state's financial capacity. The focus of this year's financial work should be on suppressing the demand for funds and controlling fiscal expenditure. The State Council has decided that this year's increased fiscal revenue will mainly be used to guarantee the funds needed for price and wage reforms and the necessary expenditures for agriculture, education, science, and national defense, and other expenditures will generally maintain the expenditure level of last year, and some items, such as the self-raised construction investment and potential improvement expenditure arranged by local areas with discretionary funds, and some special funds of the central finance, have been reduced.

Comrades and Deputies: The 1989 national budget draft has been repeatedly calculated and studied, with full revenue and tight expenditure arrangements, and there is still a large gap with the needs of all aspects. Even with such an arrangement, there is still a certain amount of deficit, which is unavoidable. This year, the financial supply and demand of the state are very prominent, and both the central finance and the local finance have great difficulties. In the budget execution, various regions and departments must make every effort to increase revenue and tighten expenditure, control the deficit within the amount determined by the state budget, and strive to reduce it.

III. Unifying Understanding, Considering the Overall Situation, and Striving to Complete the 1989 National Budget Task

To ensure the completion of the 1989 national budget, various regions and departments must unify their understanding, consider the overall situation, carry forward the spirit of hard struggle and frugal construction, and closely combine the rectification, rectification, and reform with the "increase production and reduce expenditure, increase revenue and reduce expenditure" campaign, and do a solid job in various aspects.

(1) Continue to carry out the "increase production and reduce expenditure, increase revenue and reduce expenditure" campaign to ensure the stable growth of fiscal revenue. Insisting on "increase production and reduce expenditure, increase revenue and reduce expenditure" is the key to ensuring the stable growth of fiscal revenue. In order to eliminate economic overheating, the growth rate of industry this year should be appropriately reduced, which will have some impact on fiscal revenue. Therefore, the growth of this year's revenue mainly relies on improving economic benefits and opening up new financial sources to achieve. Various regions and departments should actively increase the production of energy and short-line raw materials, daily necessities of people's lives, marketable light textile products, and cash-absorbing scarce commodities, as well as export-earning products. All enterprises should strive to improve product quality, reduce energy and raw material consumption, and save various expenses, tap internal potential. This year, the state requires state-owned industrial enterprises to reduce the consumption of raw materials and energy by 1%, reduce enterprise management fees and workshop expenses by 10%, and turn around the loss-making products of loss-making enterprises and profitable enterprises by 25%; the loss subsidies for grain enterprises and food enterprises should be controlled within the state-approved indicators. Various regions and departments should implement these indicators to enterprises layer by layer and conduct strict assessments. For those who fail to complete the above indicators, part of the enterprise's retained profits should be deducted, and the deducted part should be correspondingly reduced from the enterprise's reward fund.

(2) Open up financial sources, concentrate funds, and organize various revenues. The State Council decided to take several measures to increase revenue this year, mainly to levy new taxes and concentrate extra-budgetary funds. These measures to increase revenue have been included in the national budget, and the amounts are relatively large, and must be implemented item by item to ensure completion, otherwise, the deficit will be expanded. The implementation of these measures will inevitably affect the interests of all parties, so it is necessary to correctly handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, and correctly handle the relationship between partial interests and overall interests, insisting on the principle of partial interests subordinating to overall interests. In order to ensure the implementation of measures such as concentrating funds and levying new taxes, the State Council has formulated specific methods, which will be issued and implemented in succession. Various regions and departments should do a good job in publicity and mobilization, and strengthen leadership, organize forces, and do a solid job in tax collection and management to ensure the completion of various revenue-increasing tasks. It is necessary to insist on rule-based taxation, and the power to reduce and exempt taxes should be mainly concentrated in the central government and should not be decentralized. All regions and departments have no right to reduce and exempt taxes beyond the provisions of the tax law. All units and individuals must handle tax registration, tax declaration, and tax inspection in accordance with the provisions of the tax law, and pay taxes on time and in full. Tax evasion, tax avoidance, and tax resistance should be resolutely investigated and dealt with; if a crime is constituted, it should be handed over to the judicial authorities for legal processing; all levels of financial and tax departments should strengthen tax collection and management and do a good job in organizing revenue, strictly implement the national treasury deposit and settlement system, and all funds that should be remitted to the finance should be collected and remitted to the treasury on time and in full. No region or department is allowed to withhold or misappropriate funds.

(3) Control fiscal expenditure and suppress the purchasing power of social groups. In order to ease the contradiction between total demand and total supply, it is necessary to suppress the demand for funds and reduce fiscal expenditure, not only to reduce the total demand for funds, but also to adjust the expenditure structure and achieve both guarantees and pressures, and different treatments. All regions and departments must strictly control the expenditure according to the expenditure indicators determined by the state budget, and only allow reductions, not increases. This year, the self-raised construction investment and potential improvement funds arranged by local areas with discretionary funds will be reduced by 2 billion yuan each on the basis of the estimated execution amount of last year, and allocated to various regions, strictly controlled according to the reduction indicators, and not exceeded. The purchasing power of social groups this year will be further reduced by 20% on the basis of last year's reduction, and effective measures will be taken to ensure the achievement of the reduction indicators. It is strictly forbidden to arbitrarily establish institutions and increase the number of personnel. According to the requirements of the State Council, the inspection of buildings and halls should be carried out seriously, and those that should be stopped should be stopped, and those that should be delayed should be delayed, and new projects should not be started. Various meetings should be reduced, and the wasteful behavior of using public funds to entertain guests, send gifts, travel, and privatize public funds should be stopped. The practice of issuing rewards, goods, and subsidies arbitrarily should be stopped.

(4) Deepen the reform of the financial and tax system, improve the enterprise contract responsibility system, and implement various forms of financial contracting methods for local areas. This year, the reform of enterprises should be further deepened, the contract responsibility system should be improved, and the all-person risk mortgage contract should be actively tried. Enterprises that fail to complete the contract tasks should make up the losses with their own funds and should not make profits without losses. At the same time, some regions and enterprises should be selected to try the method of tax and profit separation for state-owned enterprises, that is, adjust the income tax rate, change the pre-tax loan repayment to post-tax loan repayment, and implement the post-tax profit contract. The state will continue to implement various forms of contracting methods for local areas. This year, the impact of price and wage reforms and the adjustment of bank interest rates on finance will be borne by the central and local governments at different levels according to the current financial system; the impact on enterprises will not be adjusted, and enterprises will digest it through improving the internal management responsibility system, tapping potential, and improving efficiency.

(5) Strengthen budget management and strictly enforce financial discipline. The national budget, central budget, and local budgets, after being approved by the people's congresses at various levels, must be strictly implemented according to the budget, to strengthen the binding force of the budget. No unit or leader can arbitrarily issue vouchers, open loopholes, add money, or spend money after the budget is determined, and arbitrarily increase new projects or issue new measures. The scope of financial receipts and expenditures and cost expenditures should be rectified, and those who arbitrarily increase the cost and arbitrarily increase the proportion of special funds should be checked and corrected in a timely manner. All regions, departments, and units should not impose funds and materials on enterprises. The financial subsidies should be rectified, and the price subsidies and policy loss subsidies for enterprises should be strictly managed according to the quota subsidy and total control system. In the second half of this year, the comprehensive tax, financial, and price inspections will be continued at an appropriate time, and the experience should be summarized and the inspections should be combined with the rectification and rectification work to improve the management system and strengthen financial supervision. All levels of state organs and personnel should be clean and law-abiding, and resolutely fight against all kinds of corruption.

Comrades and Deputies: The current financial difficulties are many, and the tasks are heavy. However, we must also fully see the favorable conditions. We have ten years of experience in reform and opening up, and we have the material foundation laid by past economic construction. We believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, relying on the joint efforts of all ethnic groups, we will definitely successfully complete the 1989 national budget task and promote the reform and construction of our country.

　　关于１９８８年国家预算执行情况和１９８９年国家预算草案的报告
    ——１９８９年３月２１日在第七届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上
    国务委员兼财政部部长  王丙乾各位代表：
    我受国务院的委托，现在向大会提出１９８８年国家预算执行情况和１９８９年国家预算草案的报告，请予审查。
    一、１９８８年国家预算执行情况
    １９８８年，在中国共产党的领导下，经过各级人民政府和全国各族人民的共同努力，改革和建设都取得了新的进展，社会生产持续增长，治理经济环境和整顿经济秩序的工作初见成效。在这个基础上，这一年财政收入超额完成了国家预算，从资金供应上基本保证了改革、建设和事业发展的需要。总的说，国家预算执行情况是比较好的。
    根据现在的预计数字，１９８８年国家财政总收入为２５８７．８２亿元，国家财政总支出为２６６８．３１亿元，收入和支出相抵，财政赤字为８０．４９亿元。这些预计数字，在将来国家决算编成以后，还会有些变化，但估计赤字数额不会突破预算。
    在上述国家财政总收入中，国内财政收入为２４５７．８２亿元，完成预算的１０１．３％；国外借款收入为１３０亿元，完成预算的１０１．６％。国内财政各项主要收入的完成情况是：各项税收２３７５．８亿元，完成预算的１０１．８％；企业收入４８．６６亿元，完成预算的１０６．５％；国内债务收入１３１．０１亿元，完成预算的１００．８％；征集能源交通重点建设资金收入１８３．５９亿元，完成预算的１０１．６％；其他各项收入１６４．５９亿元，完成预算的１１５．３％。此外，这一年还拨付了企业亏损补贴４４５．８３亿元，这项补贴是按冲减财政收入处理的，已在总收入中扣除。
    在１９８８年国家财政总支出中，用国内资金安排的支出为２５３８．３１亿元，完成预算的１０１．２％；用国外借款安排的支出为１３０亿元，完成预算的１０１．６％。各项主要支出的完成情况是：基本建设支出６１９．４９亿元，完成预算的９７．６％；挖潜改造资金和新产品试制费１４３．３３亿元，完成预算的１１７．４％；支援农村生产支出和各项农业事业费１５５．１亿元，完成预算的１００．９％；城市维护建设支出１００．９４亿元，完成预算的１１３．８％；文教科学卫生事业费４７９．０７亿元，完成预算的１０７．２％；国防费２１７．９６亿元，完成预算的１０１．３％；行政管理费２２１．０７亿元，完成预算的１２２．４％；价格补贴支出３１６．９５亿元，完成预算的８８．５％。此外，国内债务还本付息支出３４．１７亿元，国外借款还本付息支出４２．６４亿元。
    在１９８８年预算执行中，国家财政面临的困难很大，矛盾很多。这一年经济生活中，最突出的问题是，由于经济过热，需求过旺，出现了明显的通货膨胀，物价上涨幅度过大。反映到财政上，资金供需之间的矛盾突出，财政形势严峻。去年９月召开的党的十三届三中全会，正确地分析了经济形势，提出了“治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序，全面深化改革”的方针。几个月来，国务院结合治理和整顿工作采取了一系列措施。各级人民政府和各有关部门在抑制需求，调整结构，开辟财源，增加收入，控制支出，加强管理等方面，做了大量工作，取得了较好成绩。
    （一）发展生产，开辟财源，超额完成了财政收入任务。各地区、各部门围绕增产节约、增收节支运动，努力增产适销对路产品，提高产品质量，降低能源和原材料消耗，减少库存积压，扩大商品流通，生产有了新的发展。与此同时，各级财政税务部门认真贯彻国务院“关于加强税收工作，保证国家财政收入的紧急通知”，坚持依法治税，整顿减免税收，加强税收征收管理，并努力做好新税开征工作，使工商税收超额完成了任务。在生产持续发展和组织收入工作加强的基础上，这一年国内财政收入，超额完成了预算任务，并且比上年增加１９５亿元，增长８．６％，基本上实现了增产增收。
    （二）保证重点，增加了能源交通、农业和智力投资。１９８８年预算内基本建设支出是按国家预算进行控制的，执行结果没有突破预算，同上年基本持平，但对投资结构作了必要的调整。据统计，在基本建设“拨改贷”投资３２６．８５亿元中，用于能源、交通、通讯、原材料等重点建设和基础设施的投资为１５８．５１亿元，约占投资总额的５０％，这对缓解能源、交通、通讯、原材料的紧张状况，将会起积极的作用。同时，１９８８年在财政资金供需矛盾相当紧张的情况下，各级财政还增加了农业投入和智力投资。这一年用于支援农村生产和各项农业事业的支出共１５５．１亿元，比上年增长１５．６％，如果加上国家预算中用于支援贫困地区发展农业生产的扶贫专款２６亿元，合计共１８１亿元。这一年，文教科学卫生事业费支出４７９．０７亿元，比上年增长１８．９％，其中教育事业费２７１．２６亿元，比上年增长１９．７％，超过了国内经常性财政收入的增长幅度。此外，１９８８年国家预算其他支出项目中用于教育的经费和基建投资有５２．３亿元。当然，目前智力投资还不能满足事业发展的需要，今后随着国家财政收入的增加，将继续增加这方面的支出。
    （三）进一步推进财政管理体制改革，调动了地方增收节支的积极性。在改进财政管理体制方面，主要抓了两方面的工作。一是把税源比较分散的１３个地方性税种，如房产税、屠宰税、牲畜交易税、集市交易税、车船使用税、城乡个体工商业户所得税、个人所得税、个人收入调节税、农林特产税、契税等，下放地方管理，收入增长的部分全部留归地方使用。二是对收入上解比例比较大的１７个省、直辖市和计划单列市，如北京、天津、河北、辽宁、沈阳、大连、哈尔滨、上海、江苏、浙江、青岛、宁波、河南、湖南、广东、武汉、重庆等，分别实行了各种形式的财政包干办法。这两项改革，对调动地方积极性，推动各地发展经济，挖掘潜力，开辟财源，增加收入，控制支出起到了促进作用。据统计，１９８８年下放地方管理的１３种地方性税收共入库９２．１亿元，比上年增长３２．３％；１７个收入上解地区实行财政包干后，除个别地区外，收入都有不同程度的增长，其中有５个地区的收入增长１４％以上。
    （四）严格控制社会集团购买力，全面开展税收、财务、物价大检查。根据治理经济环境和整顿经济秩序的要求，国务院先后发布了《关于从严控制社会集团购买力的决定》和《关于开展税收、财务、物价大检查的通知》。各地区、各部门认真贯彻执行国务院的有关决定，并把这两项工作作为治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序的重要措施，加强领导，组织力量，做了大量工作，取得了初步成效。据全国控制社会集团购买力办公室统计，１９８８年全国县以上单位的社会集团购买力，比上年增长１．８％，其中专项控制商品比上年下降９．１％，社会集团购买力增长过快的势头初步得到控制。在税收、财务、物价大检查中，各地区、各部门在企业自查的基础上，先后派出１３万多个检查组，５９万余名检查人员深入企业、单位进行重点检查。不仅严肃了财经纪律，纠正了某些不正之风，而且也清理收回了一部分财政资金。截至去年１２月底，共查出应当上缴财政的款项６４．４亿元，已入库４２．２亿元。
    在肯定国家预算执行情况比较好的同时，我们决不能忽视国家财政存在的困难和问题。一是，国家财政已连续几年出现赤字，而且这两年不仅中央财政有赤字，有些地区也出现赤字，特别是县级财政困难比较大。财政收不抵支，出现赤字，是造成通货膨胀的因素之一，对经济稳定和人民生活都带来了不利的影响，也不利于改革的继续深化。今后不论中央财政和地方财政，都应当采取坚决的措施，逐步消除赤字，做到收支平衡。二是，企业经济效益不高，产品质量低、物质消耗大、成本费用高的现象相当普遍；企业亏损面扩大，亏损额增加，再加上企业承包办法尚不够完善，使财政收入的增长受到很大制约。同时，由于这几年减税让利过多，固定资产投资失控，税前归还贷款的数额猛增，资金过于分散，财政收入占国民收入的比重已由１９７９年的３１．９％下降到１９８８年的１９％。这样，就难以集中财力保证改革和建设的重点需要。三是，由于监督管理不严，预算约束软化，加上人们法制观念不强，以致偷税漏税，截留利润，转移资金，以及请客送礼，公费旅游等浪费现象相当严重。我们过去对这些问题认识不足，研究不够，特别是没有很好发挥财政对宏观经济的调控和监督作用，这是需要认真总结经验，逐步加以改进的。
    二、１９８９年国家预算草案
    根据中央提出的今明两年着重治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序的要求，１９８９年国家预算安排的主要原则是：在适当集中资金，增加财政收入的同时，坚决实行紧缩的财政政策，抑制资金需求，压缩财政支出，控制财政赤字。实行紧缩的财政政策，是治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序的重要内容，实质上是一次财政分配结构的调整。在调整中，必须有取有舍，有保有压，区别对待，并且各方面都要过紧日子。
    现在提请审议的１９８９年国家预算草案，财政总收入为２８５６．８亿元，比上年预计执行数增长１０．４％；财政总支出为２９３０．８亿元，比上年预计执行数增长９．８％；收支相抵，支出大于收入７４亿元，比上年预计赤字减少６．４９亿元〔注〕。
    在上述国家预算总收入中，国内财政收入为２６９１．８亿元，国外借款收入为１６５亿元。国内财政收入主要项目的安排情况是：各项税收２５５７．１４亿元，企业收入４０．０４亿元，征集能源交通重点建设资金收入２０５亿元，专项收入５２．８亿元，国家预算调节基金收入１２０亿元，国内债务收入１１１亿元，其他各项收入１２７．３亿元。此外，企业亏损补贴５２１．４８亿元，仍按冲减收入处理，已在国内财政收入中扣除。
    在１９８９年国家预算总支出中，用国内资金安排的支出为２７６５．８亿元，用国外借款收入安排的支出为１６５亿元。各项主要支出的安排情况是：基本建设支出６２７．９２亿元，企业挖潜改造资金和新产品试制费１２５．８３亿元，支援农村生产支出和各项农业事业费１７３．９６亿元，城市维护建设支出１０３亿元，文教科学卫生事业费５１３．８８亿元，国防费２４５．５亿元，行政管理费２２６．６４亿元，价格补贴支出４０９．６９亿元，国内债务还本付息支出２５．４８亿元，国外借款还本付息支出７０．２亿元，行政事业单位调整工资增加支出３５亿元。此外，总预备费编列２５亿元，其中，中央预备费为１０亿元，地方预备费为１５亿元。
    根据许多人大代表的建议，国务院决定，从１９８９年起对国家预算的编制方法作必要的改进，即在编制国家预算的同时，分别编制中央预算和地方预算。现在提请大会审查的国家预算草案和中央预算草案经大会审议批准后，即按此执行；地方预算由各级人民政府根据国务院确定的收支指标，进行具体编制，然后提请地方各级人民代表大会审查批准。
    １９８９年中央预算收入为１６６７．７５亿元，支出为１７４１．７５亿元，收支相抵，支出大于收入７４亿元。
    中央预算收入中，中央本级收入１２２２．５４亿元，地方上解中央的收入４４５．２１亿元。中央本级收入的主要项目安排情况是：各项税收７３６．５９亿元，企业收入２７．７４亿元，征集能源交通重点建设资金收入１６７．８３亿元，专项收入５２．８亿元，国家预算调节基金收入７８亿元，国内债务收入１１１亿元，国外借款收入１６５亿元。此外，企业亏损补贴１９９．９２亿元，按冲减收入处理，已在收入中做了扣除。
    在中央预算支出中，中央本级支出１１８０．７亿元，对地方的补助支出５６１．０５亿元。中央本级支出的主要项目安排情况是：基本建设支出４９１．６２亿元，挖潜改造和新产品试制费５０．７７亿元，地质勘探费３３．９亿元，支援农村生产支出和各项农业事业费２０．３５亿元，文教科学卫生事业费６６．０７亿元，国防费２４３．３亿元，行政管理费２１．７亿元，国内债务还本付息支出２５．４８亿元，国外借款还本付息支出７０．２亿元，价格补贴支出５５．０７亿元，行政事业单位调整工资增加支出１０．９６亿元，中央预备费１０亿元。
    １９８９年由国务院确定的地方预算收支指标，收入为２１９５．３１亿元，支出为２１９５．３１亿元，收支平衡。在地方预算收入中，地方组织的收入１６３４．２６亿元，中央对地方的补助收入５６１．０５亿元。在地方预算支出中，地方本级支出１７５０．１亿元，地方上解中央的支出４４５．２１亿元。这是就全国算总帐来说的，具体到各个地区，有些地方可能有结余，有些地方可能有差额，困难不少。因此，国务院要求各级地方人民政府按照国家确定的财政收支指标，认真核算和编制地方预算，并要采取有效措施，增加收入，控制支出，努力做到收支自求平衡，不打赤字预算。
    上述国家预算草案，是根据今年国民经济和社会发展计划的要求计算的，同时也考虑了价格、工资改革和调整银行利率影响财政减收增支的因素，考虑了财政上采取政策性措施可以增收减支的数额。这里，我着重说明以下几点：
    （一）关于适当集中资金问题。这几年，预算外资金增长很快，预计１９８８年将达到２２７０亿元，比１９７９年的４５３亿元，增长４倍，而预算内资金增长缓慢，不能保证改革和建设的需要。为了改变目前财政资金过于分散的状况，逐步提高财政收入占国民收入的比例，增强财政的宏观调控能力，国务院决定，从１９８９年起，对所有国营企事业单位、机关团体、部队和地方政府的各项预算外资金，以及城市和乡镇集体企业、私营企业、个体工商户缴纳所得税后的利润，按照１０％的比例计征国家预算调节基金。据测算，当年约可征收１２０亿元。同时，为了调节生产和消费，并开辟新的财源，国务院还确定，今年对彩色电视机、小汽车开征特别消费税；对农林特产税扩大征收范围，适当提高税率；对自筹基本建设投资征收的建筑税，适当调整税率，改进征收办法；对进口关税和海关代征的进口产品的产品税、增值税，改按实际汇率征收，以及其他增收措施，合计约可增加收入１３１亿元。
    （二）关于增加农业投入问题。农业生产对整个国民经济起着极大的推动和制约作用，是增加有效供给、抑制通货膨胀、稳定经济的基础。为确保今年农业生产特别是粮食、棉花、油料生产有较大增长，国家财政增加了对农业的投入。１９８９年国家预算安排支援农村生产支出和各项农业事业费１７３．９６亿元，比上年预计执行数增加１８．８６亿元，增长１２．２％，中央和地方财政还安排各项扶贫专款２９亿元，比上年增加３亿元。同时，国务院决定，今年将适当提高粮食、油料合同定购价，提高棉花收购价，并对国家计划内的议购粮改按市价收购，财政上需增加补贴近９０亿元，可以相应增加农民收入。
    （三）关于增加智力投资问题。这几年，文教科学卫生事业费增长很快。从１９７９年到１９８８年，平均每年增长１５．６％，其中教育事业费增长１５．３％，大大超过同期经常性财政收入的增长幅度。１９８９年国家预算安排文教科学卫生事业费５１３．８８亿元，比上年预计执行数增加３４．８１亿元，增长７．３％，其中教育事业费安排２９８．６４亿元，比上年预计执行数增加２７．３８亿元，增长１０．１％。此外，国家预算其他支出项目中用于教育的经费和基建投资有６５．３６亿元，比上年增加１３亿元；调整工资和其他教育补助费增加１０亿元。以上合计增加５０亿元。在财政相当困难、各方面紧缩支出的情况下，国家对智力投资已尽很大努力作了安排。同时，我们还要求，各级政府和各个部门在预算执行中，通过努力增收节支，挖掘潜力，尽可能再增加一些教育经费。
    （四）关于银行调整利率和实行储蓄存款保值问题。为了稳定金融，增加城乡居民储蓄存款，控制各项贷款，减少货币投放，国务院决定，从去年９月起，存贷款利率各提高１个百分点，并对３年期以上定期储蓄存款实行保值；从今年２月１日起，对城乡居民和企事业单位定期存款利率平均提高３．０６个百分点，对各类贷款利率平均提高２．３４个百分点。采取这些措施，国家财政是要付出很大代价的。据测算，由于银行调整利率和对３年期以上定期储蓄存款实行保值，约净减少财政收入９０多亿元，已在国家预算中作了安排。
    （五）关于调整职工工资问题。为了进一步调动职工的积极性，解决由于物价上涨给职工生活带来的困难，并适当解决工资关系中的某些突出不合理问题，国务院决定，在今年适当时候，提高行政事业单位职工的工资，增发行政事业单位和国营企业离退休人员的生活费补贴，并准备适当解决工资关系中的某些突出不合理的问题；同时，对国营企业普遍推行工资与经济效益挂钩的办法，主要通过提高经济效益来增加职工工资。采取以上几项措施，国家财政约需减收增支５５亿元，其中减少收入２０亿元，已分别列入各有关收入项目之中；增加支出３５亿元，已在国家预算支出中单独编列，待措施出台后，再分别列入各有关科目。
    （六）关于严格控制财政支出问题。这几年，财政支出增长较快，超过了国家财政的承受能力。今年财政工作的重点应当放在抑制资金需求和控制财政支出方面。国务院确定，今年增加的财政收入，主要用于保证价格、工资改革所必需的资金和必要的农业、教育、科学、国防支出，其他各项支出一般维持上年支出水平，有些项目，如地方用机动财力安排的自筹基建投资、挖潜改造支出和中央财政的某些专款，已作了压缩。
    各位代表：１９８９年国家预算草案，是经过反复测算和研究拟定的，收入打得很满，支出安排很紧，同各方面的需要有很大差距。尽管这样安排，仍有一定数额的赤字，这是不得已而为之的。今年国家财政资金的供需矛盾非常突出，不论中央财政和地方财政，都有很大困难。在预算执行中，各地区、各部门必须尽最大努力增加收入，紧缩支出，把赤字控制在国家预算确定的数额之内，并力争有所缩小。
    三、统一认识，顾全大局，为完成１９８９年国家预算任务而努力
    为了确保１９８９年国家预算的完成，各地区、各部门必须统一认识，顾全大局，发扬艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的精神，把治理、整顿、改革同增产节约、增收节支运动紧密结合起来，扎扎实实地做好各项工作。
    （一）继续开展增产节约、增收节支运动，保证财政收入的稳定增长。坚持增产节约、增收节支，是保证财政收入稳定增长的关键。为了消除经济过热，今年工业增长速度要适当降低，对财政收入会有一些影响。因此，今年收入的增长，主要靠提高经济效益和开辟新的财源来实现。各地区、各部门要积极增产能源和短线原材料，人民生活必需的日用工业品，适销对路的轻纺产品和回笼货币多的紧俏商品，以及出口创汇产品。所有企业都要努力提高产品质量，降低动力和原材料消耗，节约各种费用，挖掘内部潜力。今年国家要求国营工业企业的原材料、能源消耗降低１％，企业管理费和车间经费降低１０％，亏损企业和盈利企业的亏损产品扭亏２５％；粮食企业、食品企业亏损补贴要控制在国家核定的指标之内。各地区、各部门要把这些指标层层落实到企业，严格进行考核。对完不成上述指标的，要扣减企业的留利，扣减部分要相应减少企业的奖励基金。
    （二）开辟财源，集中资金，大力组织各项收入。今年国务院决定采取的若干增收措施，主要是开征新税和集中预算外资金。这些增收措施已列入国家预算，而且数额较大，必须逐项落实，保证完成，否则，就会扩大赤字。采取这些措施，必然会影响到各方面的利益，这就需要正确处理好国家、集体、个人三者的关系，正确处理好局部利益和全局利益的关系，坚持局部服从全局的原则。为了保证集中资金、开征新税等项措施的落实，国务院已制定了具体办法，将陆续颁发执行。各地区、各部门要做好宣传动员工作，并要加强领导，组织力量，扎扎实实做好征收管理工作，确保各项增收任务的完成。要坚持依法治税，税收的减免权限主要集中在中央，不能分散。各地区、各部门都无权超越税法规定减免税收。任何单位和个人都要按照税法规定，办理税务登记，进行纳税申报，接受税务检查，及时足额地交纳税款。对偷税、漏税、抗税的行为，要坚决进行查处；构成犯罪的，要送司法机关依法处理；各级财税部门要加强征收管理，做好组织收入的工作，严格国家金库入库报解制度，凡是应当上交财政的收入，都要及时足额地收缴入库，任何地区和部门都不得截留和挪用。
    （三）控制财政支出，压缩社会集团购买力。为了缓解社会总需求与总供给的矛盾，必须把抑制资金需求，压缩财政支出放在首位，不仅要压缩资金需求总量，而且要调整支出结构，做到有保有压，区别对待。各地区、各部门都必须按国家预算确定的支出指标，严格进行控制，执行中只许节减，不许超过。今年地方用机动财力安排的自筹基建投资和挖潜改造资金，要在上年预计执行数的基础上，各压缩２０亿元，并分配下达到各地区，严格按压缩指标控制，不得突破。今年的社会集团购买力，要在上年压缩的基础上，再压缩２０％，并采取切实有效的措施，保证压缩指标的实现。要严格禁止随意增设机构，增加人员编制。要按照国务院的要求，认真清查楼堂馆所，该停建的停建，该缓建的缓建，坚决不上新的项目。要压缩各种会议，制止用公款请客送礼、游山玩水、化公为私等挥霍浪费行为，要刹住乱发奖金、实物、补贴的歪风。
    （四）深化财税改革，完善企业承包经营责任制和对地方实行的各种形式的财政包干办法。今年要进一步深化企业改革，完善承包经营责任制，积极试行全员风险抵押承包，企业完不成承包任务的，要用自有资金来弥补，不能包盈不包亏。同时，要选择一些地区和企业，对国营企业试行税利分流的办法，即调整所得税税率，把税前还贷改为税后还贷，实行税后利润承包。国家对地方继续实行各种形式的包干办法。今年价格、工资改革和银行利率调整对财政的影响，按现行财政体制由中央和地方分级承担；对企业的影响，也不调整包干基数，由企业通过完善企业内部经营责任制，挖掘潜力，提高效益来自行消化。
    （五）强化预算管理，严肃财经纪律。国家预算、中央预算和地方预算，经各级人代会批准以后，必须严格按预算办事，以强化预算约束力。任何单位和领导人都不能在预算确定之后，任意批条子，开口子，想加钱就加钱，想开支就开支，随便增加新的项目，出台新的措施。要整顿财务收支和成本开支范围，对于乱摊乱挤成本的，擅自提高专项基金提取比例的，滥发奖金、补贴和实物的，都要及时检查纠正。各地区、各部门、各单位也不得向企业摊派资金和物资。要整顿财政补贴，对各种价格补贴和企业的政策性亏损补贴，必须实行严格的定额补贴和总额控制相结合的管理制度。在今年下半年适当时候，要继续组织税收、财务、物价大检查，并且要总结经验，把大检查同治理、整顿工作结合起来，健全管理制度，严格财政监督。各级国家机关和工作人员都要廉洁奉公，遵纪守法，同各种腐败现象作坚决斗争。
    各位代表：当前国家财政面临的困难很多，任务很重。但是，我们也要充分看到有利条件，我们已有十年改革、开放的经验，有过去经济建设奠定的物质基础。我们相信，在中国共产党领导下，依靠各族人民的共同努力，一定会圆满实现１９８９年的国家预算任务，把我国的改革和建设事业推进一步。
    〔注〕有些同志建议，应把国内外债务收入作为赤字处理。如果按此口径计算，１９８９年全国财政赤字为３５０亿元，比上年按相同口径计算的赤字３４１．５亿元增加８．５亿元。
