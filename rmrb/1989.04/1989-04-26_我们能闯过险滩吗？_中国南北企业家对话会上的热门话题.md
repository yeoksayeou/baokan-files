Recently, at the South-North Entrepreneurs Dialogue held in Guangzhou, more than 100 entrepreneurs eagerly took the floor to speak.

The manager of Yangzhuang Coal Mine, Huabei Coal Mining Bureau, said, "The mine is overloaded, but there is coal that cannot be transported out, with 400 million tons accumulated. We are sitting on a mountain of coal but have no money to spend." Entrepreneurs from Guangzhou said, "We are desperate for coal, but the money to buy it is hard to come by."

The general manager of Wanbao Electrical Appliances Company, which has entered the ranks of the world's strongest, said, "Last year, the entire company achieved a tax revenue of 400 million yuan and earned 100 million US dollars in foreign exchange. However, this year, the 700 million yuan in working capital needed was reduced to 100 million yuan. Material reserves are decreasing daily, and customs duties and additional processing fees amount to thousands of yuan. Due to banks only accepting deposits and not lending, we cannot repay them. Some enterprises have already stopped production or are in a semi-stopped state."

One entrepreneur openly expressed at the meeting, "I don't want to be the factory director for even a second."

In economic life, one knot after another that is hard to untie appears before the entrepreneurs. The external environment for enterprises is quite tight. Although the dialogue organizing committee had arranged 10 major discussion topics in advance, the topics naturally converged on a hot spot – in the face of a shortage of funds, raw materials, and energy, can enterprises navigate the rapids?

The rectification and adjustment should implement a tilted policy and focus on solving the "basket of essentials" for key enterprises. Only in this way can the "basket of essentials" for the finance and urban residents be solved.

The general manager of Guangzhou Zinc Sheet Factory, Peng Jìngzhuāng, said that funds, raw materials, and energy are the main items in the "basket of essentials" for industrial enterprises. Without them, enterprises will face stagnation, resulting in a weakened effective supply capacity and a sharp decrease in the tax revenue they turn over. In recent years, enterprises have absorbed many unfavorable factors, but this internal absorption capacity is limited. Once the market encounters "stormy waves," some enterprises may "capsize." In the current situation where the country's financial and material resources are both difficult, adjustment measures cannot be "one-size-fits-all" and should have priorities and protections.

The general manager of Wanbao Electrical Appliances Company, Dèng Shàoshēn, emphasized that the "basket of essentials" for factories should be solved as soon as possible; otherwise, the "basket of essentials" for finance will become heavier and heavier, and the "basket of essentials" for residents will not be solved well. Wanbao Company imports 80% of its raw materials and exports 30% of its products, basically operating with both ends abroad. But now there is a lack of funds and raw materials, and we cannot bear it. The country will also suffer losses.

The general manager of Beijing STG Group, Wàn Rùnnán, proposed 10 hopes for rectification and adjustment. He said that rectification and adjustment cannot treat the head when the head hurts and the foot when the foot hurts, nor can it treat the head when the foot hurts and take the wrong medicine. Currently, different regions, industries, and enterprises need to be treated differently, with some being pressured and others being protected. Protection means not only giving policies but also filling the factory's "basket of essentials" with more things.

In the face of the severe new situation, hesitation is not the way out. We should look inward, create a "microclimate" for enterprise development, and share the country's burden.

The general manager of Guangzhou Iron and Steel Limited Company, Peng Shàohuī, emphasized in his two speeches the idea of looking inward. He said that we entrepreneurs should not passively wait for the improvement of the external environment but should look inward, deepen enterprise internal reforms, and share the country's worries. He said that last year, the company's cost expenditure alone increased by 50 million yuan. Due to the extensive promotion of the "double increase and double saving" activities, a tax revenue of 110 million yuan was achieved. This year, after the steel price limit, the enterprise's income decreased by 40 million yuan. They did not complain and prepared to work hard and save 30 million yuan, striving to achieve a tax revenue of 120 million yuan this year.

The general manager of Beijing Dama Enterprise Group, Xú Xiàochún, said that "calamities breed greatness" is our reality, and this point should be conveyed to the broad masses of workers to enhance the cohesion of the enterprise.

The general manager of Guangzhou Automobile and Agricultural Machinery Industry Company, Lí Zhènxióng, said that the microclimate of the enterprise helps to improve the macroclimate of the country, and the enterprise should do its part. Currently, the first step is to improve the internal mechanism of the enterprise.

The problems that arise during the reform still need to be solved through reform, and going back will result in punishment by objective laws.

In the face of difficulties, we must enhance both the material and psychological resilience.

The general manager of Guangzhou Light Industry Machinery Factory, Zhāng Xuémíng, said that we must adhere to comprehensive deepening of the reform. Going back on our steps will inevitably result in punishment by objective laws. He proposed that enterprises should currently enhance their material and psychological resilience. Enterprises with conditions should gradually implement the shareholding system to enhance the enterprise's autonomy, self-discipline, and self-development capabilities; combine industrial structure adjustment, and gradually implement the merger of advantageous enterprises with loss-making and low-profit enterprises, develop enterprise groups, and optimize enterprise structure; under the guidance of the theory of separating the two powers, further improve the contract responsibility system.

The general manager of Beijing Heavy Machinery Factory, Wú Zōngjiāng, said that on the basis of doing a good job in ideological and political work, we should mobilize the enthusiasm of all employees. This is another important way to enhance the enterprise's resilience to difficulties. Currently, we need to reverse the "loss of sense of ownership" among employees, gradually make the relationship between laborers, operators, and the collective more intimate, form a community of shared destiny with basic common interests, and jointly navigate the difficulties.

　　我们能闯过险滩吗？    
    ——中国南北企业家对话会上的热门话题
    本报记者  陆振华
    不久前，在广州举行的南北企业家对话会上，与会的１００多位企业家争先恐后地抢着发言。
    淮北矿务局杨庄煤矿矿长说：“矿井超负荷生产，但有煤运不出去，积压４００万吨，我们守着煤山没钱花。”广州的企业家说：“我们是思煤若渴，但买煤的钱没处着落。”
    跻身于世界之强的万宝电器工业公司总经理说：“去年全公司实现利税４亿元，创汇１亿美元，但今年需要的７亿元流动资金被减缩为１亿元，材料储备日少，关税和外加工费数千元，因银行只收不贷而无法付还，有些企业已陷于停产或半停产状态。”
    有位企业家在会上公开表示：“我这个厂长一秒钟也不想当。”
    经济生活中一个个难解的“结”出现在企业家面前。企业的外部环境颇不宽松。尽管对话会筹备组事先安排１０大讨论题，但是话题很自然地集中到一个热点上——在资金、原材料、能源紧缺的形势下，企业能闯过险滩吗？
    治理整顿要实行倾斜政策，注意解决骨干企业的“菜篮子”。只有这样才能解决好财政的“菜篮子”和城镇居民的“菜篮子”。
    广州锌片厂厂长彭敬庄说，资金、原材料、能源是工业企业“菜篮子”中的主菜。企业没有它们，定会出现滞胀，结果有效供给力减弱，上交的税利也会锐减。近年来，企业已消化了许多不利因素，但这种内部消化能力是有限的，一旦市场刮起“风浪”，有的企业难免要“翻船”。在目前国家财力、物力都比较困难的情况下，调整措施不能“一刀切”，应有舍有保。
    万宝电器工业公司总经理邓绍深强调说，要尽快解决工厂的“菜篮子”，否则财政的“菜篮子”越提越重，居民的“菜篮子”解决不好。万宝公司进口的原材料占８０％，外销产品占３０％，基本上是两头在外的企业。但现在缺少资金和原材料，我们承受不了，国家也会遭到损失。
    北京四通集团公司总经理万润南对治理整顿提出１０点希望。他说，治理整顿不能头痛医头，脚痛医脚，更不能头痛医脚，吃错药。目前需要区别对待，不同地区、不同行业和企业，该压的压，该保的必须保。保就是除给政策外，还要让工厂的“菜篮子”里多装些东西。
    在严峻的新形势下彷徨不前没有出路。应该眼睛向内，创造企业发展的“小气候”，为国分担压力。
    广州钢铁有限公司总经理彭绍辉在两次发言中都强调了眼睛向内的意见。他说，我们企业家不能被动地等待外部环境的改善，而是要把眼睛向内，深化企业内部改革，和国家共同分忧。他说，去年全公司仅成本支出就增加５０００万元，由于广泛开展双增双节活动，实现利税１．１亿元。今年钢材限价后企业减少收入４０００万元，他们不叫苦，准备埋头苦干，节支３０００万元，争取今年实现利税１．２亿元。
    北京达美企业集团总经理徐孝纯说，“多难兴邦”是我们面临的现实，这一点要告诉广大职工，增强企业的凝聚力。
    广州市汽车农机工业公司总经理黎振雄说，企业的小气候有助于改善国家大气候，企业要尽我所为。目前首先要改善企业内部机制。
    改革中出现的问题还要靠改革解决，退回去会受到客观规律的惩罚。
    在困难面前，既要增强物质方面的承受力，又要增强心理方面的承受力。
    广州轻工业机械厂厂长张学铭说，必须坚持全面深化改革。走回头路必然会受到客观规律的惩罚。他提出当前企业要增强物质上和心理上的承受能力。有条件的企业逐步实行股份制，以便增强企业自主经营、自我约束、自我发展的能力；结合产业结构调整，有步骤地推行优势企业兼并亏损、微利企业，发展企业集团，优化企业结构；在两权分离的理论指导下，进一步完善承包制。
    北京重型机器厂厂长吴宗江说，要在做好思想政治工作的基础上，调动全体职工的积极性，这是增强企业对困难承受力的又一重要途径。当前要扭转职工中的“主人翁失落感”，逐步使劳动者、经营者和集体的关系更加密切，形成基本利益一致的命运共同体，共闯难关。
