Xinhua News Agency, Washington, April 9th.

American officials have advised the government to adopt a cautious approach towards the diplomatic offensive launched by Soviet leader Gorbachev. President Bush's national security advisor, Brent Scowcroft, and Secretary of State James Baker made these remarks today.

Scowcroft stated that the Bush administration should avoid making "obvious and dramatic changes" in its policy towards the Soviet Union.

Baker, in an interview on the American Broadcasting Company's television program, said that President Bush must adopt a cautious, prudent, and realistic approach when formulating policy. He added that no one can be certain whether "Brezhnevism" is truly dead.

Last week, experts from the Central Intelligence Agency, the State Department, the Department of Defense, and the National Security Council submitted a report to President Bush. The report recommended a middle-of-the-road approach to Soviet policy, avoiding both passivity and reckless adventurism.

　　美人士建议政府对苏谨慎
    新华社华盛顿４月９日电　美国总统国家安全顾问斯考克罗夫特和国务卿贝克今天强调指出，布什政府应对苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫发动的外交攻势采取审慎态度。
    总统国家安全顾问斯考克罗夫特说，布什政府在对苏政策中不应采取“明显的、戏剧性的变化”。
    贝克在美国广播公司的电视节目中说，布什总统在制订政策时必须要采取小心、谨慎和现实的态度，因为谁也不能肯定“勃列日涅夫主义”是否已经死亡。
    美国中央情报局、国务院、国防部和国家安全委员会的专家上星期向布什总统提出了一份报告，建议对苏政策取中间道路，既不被动观望、也不能盲目进取。
