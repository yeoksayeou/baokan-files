The past four years of agricultural stagnation have been used by some as an excuse to speak ill of reform. This is neither factual nor fair.

The rural reforms following the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee did not initially bring significant increases in agricultural production? Statistics show that from 1979 to 1981, the three-year growth rate in agricultural labor productivity was roughly equal to the total growth rate from 1952 to 1978 over 26 years. If agricultural production had not benefited so greatly from reform, the debate over whether the household responsibility system was "good" or "bad" would not have been resolved so smoothly. Everyone knows that implementing the household responsibility system encountered significant resistance. It was precisely because rural reforms brought such great benefits that those who originally opposed the household responsibility system stopped speaking out. In agricultural output, grain production was not the most prominent, but by 1984, compared to 1978, it still increased from 304,770,000 tons to 407,310,000 tons, a 30% increase over six years. In the 20 years before the reform, from 1958 to 1978, it only increased by 53%. Since the effectiveness of rural reforms has been proven, why blame the stagnation in agriculture on reform?

Indeed, from 1985 onwards, agriculture has experienced a period of stagnation over the past four years. However, this stagnation should be acknowledged as occurring at a higher level after the reforms have already achieved significant results, not a retreat to the level before the reforms.

Why has this stagnation occurred? There are various opinions. I also have my own views, but I will not elaborate on them in this short article. Farmers have their own accounts. Farmers are very practical; they can tell you why they are willing to plant one type of crop but not another; why they are willing to invest more labor and capital or not. Under what price conditions for agricultural means of production and agricultural products, they should respond in a certain way, farmers can still calculate this clearly. Orders given to them may control the sowing area but cannot control their intrinsic enthusiasm. The fact that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy and that grain production must not be relaxed are principles that leaders and macro-decision makers must understand. To turn these principles into actions by the vast majority of rural residents, various policies must be correct. Overestimating the role of orders or slogans is not practical. Additionally, whether the payment for purchasing agricultural products is in cash or in IOUs, farmers certainly pay great attention to this.

When discussing agricultural issues, one cannot place livestock farming in a low position. Currently, there is a view that when talking about developing agricultural production, it only focuses on grain production. They only see that developing livestock farming consumes grain, but they do not see that developing livestock farming can utilize materials containing nutritional elements that human digestive and immune systems cannot accept, and they do not see that developing livestock farming is necessary for maintaining a good agricultural ecological cycle.

There is also a view that overly emphasizes the conflict between township enterprises and agriculture, without considering what will happen to the countryside if township enterprises decline.

In summary, I believe that the measures to be taken to break through agricultural stagnation and the problems to be solved are not single-minded. In addition to necessary administrative measures, all effective economic, cultural, and legal measures must be adopted. The key and core, however, is reform. I believe that as long as we work together to carry out reforms and persist with them, agriculture can overcome the stagnation and achieve the desired significant development.

    坚持改革走出徘徊  　这４年农业的徘徊，成了一些人讲改革坏话的借口。这样做是不符合事实的，也是不公平的。
    党的十一届三中全会后最初几年的农村改革不是给农业增产带来很大的效果吗？统计表明，从１９７９到１９８１年，３年以农业劳动者计算的劳动生产率增长率大致等于从１９５２年到１９７８年这２６年的总增长率。不是农业生产因改革而取得这么高的成效，那一场包产到户是“好”还是“糟”的辩论是不会解决得这么完满的。大家都知道，推行包产到户时遇到的阻力是不小的。正因为农村改革带来这么大的效益，原先反对包产到户的人才不再说话了。在农业产值中，粮食增产不是最突出的，但是１９８４年同１９７８年比，还是从３０４７７万吨增加到４０７３１万吨。６年增加了３０％。而改革前的２０年，即１９５８年到１９７８年，只增加了５３％。农村改革的成效既然已经得到证明，为何把农业上不去归之于改革呢？
    不错，在从１９８５年起的４年中，农业的确出现一种徘徊的局面，但是这种徘徊，应该承认是在改革已经取得了成效之后在较高水平上的徘徊。不是退到改革以前的水平。
    为什么出现这种徘徊？人们有种种说法。我也有自己的看法，在这样一篇短文中我不想写了。农民们心里都有一本账。农民是很务实的，他可以告诉你为什么愿意种这种农作物而不愿意种另一种农作物；为什么愿意多投入劳动和资金或者不愿意多投入劳动和资金。在农业生产资料和农产品的怎样的价格条件下，他们应该作出怎样的反应，这笔账农民还是算得清楚的。下达给他们的指令即便可以管住播种面积却管不了他们出自内心的积极性。农业是国民经济的基础、一定不能放松粮食生产这些道理，是领导者、宏观决策者要了解的道理，它要变成广大农村居民的行动，还得依靠各项政策的正确。把指令或者口号的作用估计太高，是不实际的。还有，收购农产品时付给的是现金还是白条，农民当然非常重视。
    在讲农业问题时当然不能把畜牧业放在很低的地位。现在有一种论调，在讲到要发展农业生产时，就单纯讲粮食生产。他们只看见发展畜牧业要消耗粮食，没有看到发展畜牧业可以利用那些人的消化器官和免疫系统所不能接受的含有营养要素的物料，看不到发展畜牧业对于保持好的农业生态循环来说是必要的。　
    还有一种论调片面强调乡镇企业和农业的矛盾，而不去看如果一旦乡镇企业衰落了，给农村带来的会是什么。
    总之，我认为突破农业徘徊要采取的措施、要解决的问题决不是单打一的，除了必要的行政手段之外，还要采取一切有效的经济手段、文化手段和法律手段。而关键和核心还是改革，我相信只要能够同心同德地搞改革，坚持不懈地搞改革，农业是可以走出徘徊局面取得应有的大发展的。
