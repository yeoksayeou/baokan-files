Members of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and the Taiwan Students Association held a symposium with the "Chinese Democratic Peaceful Unification Delegation," led by Taiwan "Legislative Committee" member Fei Xiping, at the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang today.

Representatives from the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and the Taiwan Students Association introduced the basic and work situations of their respective organizations to the delegation. They also expressed their views on national reunification and cross-strait exchanges. They said that in the past two years, exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have increased, but they are still mostly one-way. Mainland compatriots visiting Taiwan and various exchanges are still subject to various restrictions, and cross-strait economic and trade exchanges are still conducted indirectly. They hope that the Taiwan authorities will lift restrictions on mainland compatriots visiting Taiwan and exchanges as soon as possible, allowing people on both sides to communicate normally; and further relax cross-strait economic and trade policies, changing indirect trade to direct trade.

Mr. Fei Xiping and members of the delegation also introduced relevant situations in Taiwan during the symposium.

　　两岸台胞在京座谈
    新华社北京４月２８日电（记者李择红）全国台联、台盟、台湾同学会成员今天在台盟中央与台湾“立法委员”费希平为团长的“中国民主和平统一访问团”座谈。
    全国台联、台盟、台湾同学会的负责人向访问团分别介绍了本部门的基本情况及工作情况，并就祖国统一及两岸交流等问题发表了看法。他们说，近两年来，海峡两岸的往来与交流日益增多，但还基本上是单向的往来，大陆同胞到台湾探亲及各项交流还受到种种限制，两岸的经贸往来也还是间接进行的。他们希望台湾当局尽快取消大陆同胞赴台探亲、交流等方面的限制，使两岸人民能够正常往来；同时进一步放宽两岸经贸政策，变间接贸易为直接贸易。
    费希平先生及访问团成员也在座谈会上介绍了台湾的有关情况。
