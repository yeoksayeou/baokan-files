The All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) held its 11th Plenary Session of the Second Executive Committee, issuing a resolution calling on all workers nationwide to achieve outstanding results to welcome the National Labor Model and Advanced Worker Commendation Conference.

The resolution states that the State Council has decided to hold a grand National Labor Model and Advanced Worker Commendation Conference in Beijing on the eve of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. This will play an important role in mobilizing the entire nation to implement the Party Central Committee's policies on rectifying the economic environment, reforming the economic system, and deepening comprehensive reforms. It will also help unite the people in overcoming various difficulties, promoting stability, advancing reforms, and developing the economy.

The resolution calls on all workers across various sectors to boost their spirits, work hard, learn from and catch up with advanced workers, and strive to become labor models. They should strive to improve all aspects of their work, making significant contributions to promoting economic development, deepening reforms, and maintaining political stability. Trade union organizations at all levels should focus on rectification, reform, and the overall situation. They should better combine the development of productive forces with the protection of workers' specific interests. During the campaign to increase production and save resources, and to increase income and reduce expenditures, they should care for workers' hardships, speak for workers, and help them solve problems. They should assist the government and administration in improving workers' working and living conditions to the greatest extent possible. In the selection of labor models and advanced workers, they should adhere to selection criteria, fully practice democracy, and actively and proactively do a good job in the selection work. They should vigorously publicize advanced examples, promote advanced experiences, care for and protect advanced individuals, and ensure that the noble spirit of advanced model workers is continuously promoted among workers.
