The sudden passing of Comrade Hu Yaobang has left us all in deep sorrow. As we reminisce about the golden era of the Central Party School during his tenure, the memory of Comrade Yaobang's timely guidance in leading us to challenge the biggest taboo of the time—the "Cultural Revolution"—always comes to mind.

Not long after he arrived at the Central Party School, Comrade Hu Yaobang instructed the Party History Research Office to establish a special group to study the "Cultural Revolution" and to draft a research outline as soon as possible. At that time, the erroneous policy of the "Two Whatevers" was prevalent. This was a formidable constraint for every member of the group. Coupled with the long-term influence of leftist ideology, thoughts were rigid, and there were numerous concerns, making it impossible to take a single step beyond the boundaries. Therefore, the research outline was completed on time, but its content was predictable.

In November 1977, Comrade Hu Yaobang personally chaired a meeting to discuss this outline. He raised sharp criticisms, saying: The viewpoint of this outline is wrong, and the method is also wrong. It does not dare to proceed from reality but starts from documents. It does not analyze the documents concretely but merely copies and pastes. Since it is copied, the participants can be excused. But when studying history, one should have one's own judgment. He also gave an example: What is the "February Countercurrent"? It is the righteous struggle of February! These words were like a thunderclap, shattering the mental shackles and guiding the research in the correct direction.

Comrade Hu Yaobang's clear and scientific attitude toward the "Cultural Revolution" was not a result of momentary excitement but was based on deep theoretical foundations and repeated contemplation. Without going into the early years, just his attitude in the Central Study Class in 1975 left a deep impression. At that time, the Central Study Class was heavily influenced by leftist tendencies. Comrade Hu Yaobang, along with a few other old comrades like Lü Zhengcao and Cheng Zihua, were in a position of being criticized and supervised in the class. However, Comrade Yaobang had his own views. When the class organized the study of Yao Wenyuan's "On the Social Basis of the Lin Biao Anti-Party Clique" and Zhang Chunqiao's "On the Comprehensive Dictatorship over the Bourgeoisie," some people enthusiastically praised them, but Comrade Yaobang remained silent and even deliberately dozed off in the large classroom. On the other hand, he was very serious about studying the original works of Marx and Lenin. When the study class graduated, he compiled his study notes into a thick book, copying them neatly and sincerely asking the instructor for feedback, which was very moving. The notes emphasized grasping the basic principles of Marxism and the essence of Mao Zedong's works. They included the spirit of seeking truth from facts and the Marxist viewpoint of practice, among others. The contrast was clear. After graduating from the Central Study Class, Comrade Yaobang went to lead the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and his achievements and experiences are well-known. Therefore, it was natural for him to become an early advocate and promoter of denouncing the "Cultural Revolution."

After that meeting, the research group, under the specific guidance of Comrade Wu Jiang, the then Deputy Director of the Central Party School, redrafted the research outline. The draft went through several revisions, and each time Comrade Yaobang personally reviewed and edited it. In the spring of 1978, this research outline was printed and distributed as a small booklet. It was discussed among a portion of the students at the Central Party School (mainly those in the provincial and ministerial classes) to gather opinions, which sparked a considerable response. The outline clearly stated: "Practice should be the criterion for testing truth and distinguishing the rightness or wrongness of a line. Research should be conducted in a realistic and truth-seeking manner." "Without practice or by ignoring historical facts, it is impossible to have any meaningful discussion about whether a line is correct, apart from being futile or being deceived."

Looking back at this research outline today, the level of understanding was not high, and it was still a significant distance from the later comprehensive denunciation of the "Cultural Revolution." However, objectively and fairly speaking, although this research outline did not have a broad impact on society, it was indeed the first resounding call to challenge the extreme leftist trend within the party—the "Cultural Revolution." It became the vanguard of the later comprehensive denunciation of the "Cultural Revolution." In Comrade Hu Yaobang's lifetime achievements, this is, of course, a small matter, but it is equally something that should not be forgotten.

　　否定“文革”的先导
    金春明　李振霞
    胡耀邦同志突然不幸离我们而去了，大家都非常悲痛。在怀念他主持中共中央党校工作期间那段党校历史上的黄金时代时，耀邦同志及时引导大家向当时最大的禁区——“文化大革命”冲击一事，总是浮现于我们的脑海。
    他来中央党校不久，就指示中共党史教研室成立一个专门研究“文化大革命”的小组，要求尽快起草一份研究提纲。当时正是“两个凡是”错误方针笼罩的时候。这对小组的每一个参加者都是一道厉害的紧箍咒。加以长期“左”的影响，思想僵化，顾虑重重，不敢越雷池半步。因此，研究提纲是按时写出来了，但内容是可想而知的。
    １９７７年１１月，胡耀邦同志亲自主持会议讨论了这份提纲。他提出了尖锐的批评说：这份提纲的观点是错误的，方法也是错误的。不敢从实际出发，而是从文件出发。对文件也不是作具体分析，而是照抄照搬。正因为是抄的，对你们这些参加者可以原谅。但研究历史，应该有自己的脑袋。他还举例说：什么“二月逆流”，是正气凛然的二月抗争嘛！这些话不啻一声春雷，震裂了思想上的紧箍咒，把研究开始引导到正确的方向。
    胡耀邦同志对“文化大革命”持这种清醒的科学的态度，绝不是出于一时的激动，而是有深厚的理论基础，经过反复的思虑。早的不说，单是１９７５年他在中央读书班时的态度，就给人留下了深刻的印象。那时的中央读书班，“左”倾势力十分严重。胡耀邦、吕正操、程子华等少数老同志，在班里处于被批判、监督的地位。但是，耀邦同志却自有主张，当读书班组织学习姚文元《论林彪反党集团的社会基础》和张春桥《论对资产阶级的全面专政》两篇文章时，一些人狂热地吹捧，耀邦同志却一言不发，甚至在大课堂上故意打磕睡。而对马列原著学习却十分认真。读书班毕业时，他把学习心得整理成厚厚一本，抄得整整齐齐，而且态度十分诚恳地要辅导员提意见，令人十分感动。笔记中强调原原本本地把握马克思主义的基本原理和毛泽东著作的精神实质。其中包括求实精神和马克思主义实践观点等等。两相对照，爱憎分明。中央读书班毕业后，耀邦同志去中国科学院担任领导工作，他的功绩和遭遇是众所周知的。因此，他成为否定“文化大革命”的先觉者和倡导者也就很自然了。
    在那次会后，研究小组在当时中央党校副教育长吴江的具体指导下，重新起草研究提纲。中间几易其稿，每次耀邦同志都亲自审阅修改。１９７８年春，这份研究提纲铅印成小册子，在中央党校部分学员（主要是省部级班）中讨论，征求意见，引起相当强烈的反响。这份提纲中，明确提出：“应当以实践为检验真理、辨别路线是非的标准，实事求是地进行研究。”“离开实践或者闭眼不看历史事实，来争论路线是否正确，除了徒劳无益或受骗上当以外，是不可能得到任何结果的。”
    今天回过头来看这份研究提纲，认识水平是不高的，较之后来对“文化大革命”的彻底否定还有相当大的距离。但是，客观公正地说，这份研究提纲虽然没有在社会上发生广泛的影响，但它确是对党内“左”倾思潮的极端——“文化大革命”发起冲击的第一声响亮的号角，成为后来彻底否定“文化大革命”的先导。在胡耀邦同志一生的功绩中，这当然只是一件小事，但它同样是不应该被忘记的。
