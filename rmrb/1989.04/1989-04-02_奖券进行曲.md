In the bustling streets of Central Road in Shenyang, several bank employees, holding bundles of red and green tickets, were enthusiastically shouting, "Come buy prize tickets! Maybe you'll get lucky and win a big prize!"

However, after the tickets were sold, a regrettable scene unfolded:

In front of a savings bank on Xinggong Street in Tiexi District, a crowd gathered, and grumbles could be heard from time to time. It turned out that depositors, who had come to redeem their prize tickets, found that the bank had not prepared enough cash, and they would have to wait a few more days to get their money.

Inside a savings bank on Huanghe Street in Shenyang, a young man took out four tickets that had won the smallest prize and received four black lighters in return. After trying them out, he found that none of them worked. The bank teller admitted, "To be honest, the lighters prepared for this batch of small prizes are all defective." The listener was astonished, "Why wasn't this mentioned when the tickets were sold?"

"Last December, I won a small prize, but I went several times to collect it, and the teller always said they were out. I really don't understand where the prizes went," complained Wang, an employee of Shenyang Signal Factory.

What was going on? It turns out that banks selling prize tickets usually allocate quotas based on the number of people and offer "piecework bonuses," but there are no such incentives when redeeming the tickets for cash or prizes. As for the small prizes that were supposed to be fully prepared but ran out early, one would have to blame the "cat" watching the "fishbowl." The concern is, if things continue this way, how will they attract depositors and expand funding channels in the future?

　　奖券进行曲
    何大新
    繁华的沈阳市中央路街头，几位银行职工手中攥着一把红绿纸头面带笑容高声吆喝：“快来买奖券呀，碰上好运气，中个头奖！”
    但奖券卖出之后，却出现了一幅令人遗憾的景象：
    在铁西区兴工街一家储蓄所门前，人头攒动，不时传出一阵阵怨声。原来，储户如约来兑换到期的奖券，没想到储蓄所未能准备下足够的现金，人们得在以后几天内才能兑换。
    在沈阳市黄河大街一家储蓄所内，一位小伙子掏出四张中了末等奖的奖券，接过四个黑色气体打火机，挨个试验后，发现都不好用。营业员说：“实话对你讲，为这批末等奖准备的打火机都是次品。”听者愕然：“当初卖奖券时怎么不说？”
    “去年十二月我中了个末等奖，几次去取，营业员都说没有了。我真不明白，奖品哪去了？”沈阳信号厂职工王某发牢骚说。
    这是怎么回事？一问才明白：银行系统卖奖券一般都按人头派指标，且有“计件奖”，而奖券到期兑换现金或领取奖品时则无此说了。至于本来准备充足的小额奖品提前“断档”，那只好找看“鱼盆”的“猫儿”算帐了。令人担忧的是，这样搞下去，今后怎么能吸引储户，拓宽集资渠道呢？
