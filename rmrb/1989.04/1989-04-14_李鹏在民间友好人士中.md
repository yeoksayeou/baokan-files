Even before deciding to accept the invitation to visit, Premier Li Peng had a wish: he definitely wanted to visit old friends who have been working tirelessly for Sino-Japanese friendship for many years and to make as many new friends as possible. On the evening of April 13, Premier Li took a helicopter from the Juntan Steel Plant of the New Japan Iron and Steel Company in Chiba Prefecture back to Tokyo, and then hurried to the Shiodome Shiodome Hotel to attend a welcoming banquet hosted by the six Japanese friendship organizations for him, spending an unforgettable moment.

Half an hour before the welcome began, the entrance of the hotel was crowded with friends from various circles who had come to attend the welcome. Among them were both elderly figures who had long been involved in Sino-Japanese friendship and young people full of youthful vigor. There were also well-known politicians, as well as figures from the economic, cultural, and scientific communities. Many people did not know Premier Li Peng personally but came to the welcome banquet out of respect for China and its leaders.

The six Japanese friendship organizations refer to organizations that have been dedicated to Sino-Japanese friendship activities in various fields for many years: the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade, the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Japan-China Economic Association, the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, and the Japan-China Friendship Parliamentarians' Union. The term "six organizations" has become a specialized term among Chinese and Japanese people. Before entering the venue, Premier Li Peng and his wife Zhu Lin, along with the accompanying personnel, were greeted by the leaders of the six friendly organizations, including Ito Seigyo, Utsunomiya Tokuma, Xiangfang Long, Yanauchi Yoshio, Okazaki Kaheita, and Higashiyama Kaii. Mr. Utsunomiya, 83 years old, held Premier Li Peng's hand and said, "If there is anything in the future, just come to me!" Mr. Okazaki, 91 years old, although he had difficulty walking, was in good spirits. Seeing this old friend of Premier Zhou, Premier Li walked up to greet him, "Mr. Okazaki, thank you!"

The Peony Hall of the Shiodome Hotel was packed with over 1,000 old and new Japanese friends. The chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Parliamentarians' Union gave a welcome speech, believing that Premier Li Peng's visit to Japan would make new contributions to the development of bilateral relations and write an important page for the new era of Sino-Japanese friendship. He expressed that the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement is the prerequisite for the development of Sino-Japanese relations, and correctly understanding history is the starting point for the friendship between the two countries. The maintenance of good relations between China and Japan, despite their different social systems, is a model to be emulated.

After Ito's welcome speech, two young women in kimonos walked onto the stage. The famous Japanese film actress Nakano Ryoko, familiar to Chinese audiences, presented Premier Li with a bouquet of fresh flowers, while another young woman presented Madame Zhu Lin with a traditional Japanese craft, a "ningyo" (doll). Nakano Ryoko has had close exchanges with the Chinese film industry and will play another role in the Japanese film "Sun Yat-sen," which is scheduled to be released in May, portraying the wife of Miyazaki Torazo, who aided Sun Yat-sen in his revolutionary activities.

Amidst enthusiastic applause, Premier Li Peng spoke extemporaneously, expressing his gratitude to the elders present and to friends he did not know, thanking them for their efforts and achievements in the cause of friendship. He said that there is an old Chinese saying, "A long journey tests the strength of a horse, and a long time reveals the heart of a person." If the power of people-to-people friendship is not so evident when Sino-Japanese relations are developing smoothly, it becomes even more apparent when Sino-Japanese relations encounter difficulties. Premier Li, with a resonant voice, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, expressed his gratitude three times and bowed several times to those who have dedicated themselves to Sino-Japanese friendship, conveying his sincere greetings and high respect. He said that the prospect of Sino-Japanese friendly cooperation is broad, and the cause of friendship between the two countries has a bright future. Premier Li's speech echoed in the spacious yet crowded venue, eliciting waves of loud applause.

Today, at the banquet, Premier Li and his entourage had no time to eat. Friends who came to greet him handed over their business cards one after another. Several thoughtful young women presented "toufang" (calligraphy scrolls) they had prepared in advance to the Premier for his signature. Premier Li walked from the stage to the audience, and then from the audience back to the stage. Wherever he went, a crowd of tens of layers formed, and those in the back could not squeeze in to say a word to the Chinese Premier. Even veteran politician Nishikido and Takeiri Yoshihisa, who regarded Premier Zhou as his mentor, were only able to break through the "crowd" with the help of relevant personnel to greet Premier Li briefly.

　　李鹏在民间友好人士中
    本报记者　孙东民
    早在决定应邀访问时，李鹏总理就有个愿望：一定要去拜访长年来为中日友好而奔忙的老朋友，尽可能多的结交新朋友。４月１３日傍晚，李总理乘直升机从地处千叶县的新日铁公司君津钢铁厂返回东京，随即赶往新大谷饭店，出席日中友好六团体为他举行的欢迎招待会，度过了难忘的时刻。
    欢迎开始前的半个钟头，饭店的入口处已挤满了参加欢迎会的各界朋友。他们之中，既有白发苍苍的中日友好的“老掘井人”，也有稚气未退的青年，既有知名的政治家，也有经济界、文化界、科技界的人士，有许多人与李鹏总理并不相识，是怀着对中国、对中国领导人的敬意前来参加欢迎会的。
    日中友好六团体，是指多年来在各个领域里专门从事中日友好活动的团体——日中友好协会、日本国际贸易促进协会、日中协会、日中经济协会、日中文化交流协会，日中友好议员联盟，“日中六团体”已变成中日人士间的专门术语。李鹏总理和夫人朱琳以及陪同人员进入会场前，６个友好团体的负责人伊东正义、宇都宫德马、向坊隆、樱内义雄、冈崎嘉平太、东山魁夷等前来迎接。８３岁的宇都宫先生握着李鹏总理的手说：“今后有什么事就找我！”９１岁的冈崎老先生虽然行走不便，但精神很好。见到这位周总理生前的挚友，李总理走上前去问候，“冈崎老先生，谢谢您！”
    新大谷饭店芙蓉大厅被１０００多位日本新老朋友挤得水泄不通。日中友好议员联盟会长致欢迎词，他认为李鹏总理的这次访日，将为推动两国关系向前发展作出新贡献，为日中友好的新时代写下重要一页。他表示，中日联合声明是发展中日关系的大前提，正确地认识历史是两国友好的出发点。社会制度不同的中日两国保持良好的关系，堪称典范。
    伊东的欢迎讲话结束后，两位穿和服的女青年走上讲台。中国观众熟悉的著名电影演员中野良子向李总理献上一束鲜花，另一位青年向朱琳同志赠送日本传统工艺品“人形”。中野良子一直与中国电影界人士有密切的交往，她在预定在５月份上映的日本电影《孙文》中扮演了另一角色——援助孙中山从事革命的宫崎寅藏的夫人。
    在热烈的掌声中，李鹏总理脱离讲稿，即席发表讲话，他向在场的前辈们和不相识的朋友道谢，感谢他们在友好事业中流下的汗水、建立的功绩。他说，中国有句老话，叫“路遥知马力，日久见人心”，如果说在中日关系顺利发展时不大显出民间友好的力量，在中日关系遇到困难时，更显得民间友好的力量。李鹏以宏亮的声音，代表中国政府和人民，向致力于中日友好的人士三次举怀，数次鞠躬，表达了亲切的慰问和崇高的敬意。他表示，中日友好合作的前景是广阔的，两国的友好事业有光明的未来。李总理的讲话，在宽阔又拥挤的会场里回荡，激起阵阵响亮的掌声。
    今天的招待会场，李总理一行根本顾不上吃饭。前来问候的朋友争相递上自己的名片，几位有心的女青年把事先准备好的“斗方”送到总理面前，请他签名留念。李鹏总理由台上走到台下，又由台下走到台上，走到哪里，哪里便围起十几层，后面的人根本无法挤进去与中国总理说句话。甚至连老政治家二阶堂先生和把周总理引为人生之师的竹入义胜先生，在有关人员的带领下，才好歹突进“重围”，前去向李总理问候几句。
