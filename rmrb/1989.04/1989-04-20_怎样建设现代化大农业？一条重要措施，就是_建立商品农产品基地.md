How to build modern large-scale agriculture? One important measure is to establish commercial agricultural product bases.

Guo Ruijin

Kaifeng City, Henan Province, is located in the key development area of the Huang-Huai Plain. To strengthen the construction of agricultural commodity bases, relevant scientific and technological personnel were organized to conduct a comprehensive survey and scientific demonstration, and formulated plans for the construction and layout of 20 bases for grains, cotton, oil, and meat. Among these, the construction of grain and cotton bases has been rapid, showing significant advantages in product quality, rapid increase in production, more commercial products sold, and good economic benefits within two years. The total grain production in 1987 increased by 86,000 tons compared to 1986, with an increase of 15 kilograms per mu. In 1988, despite consecutive droughts, 75% of the towns in Tongxu, Kaifeng, and Lankao, the three grain base counties, built drought-resistant and flood-resistant fields, increasing production by two to three times compared to the previous year. The total cotton production in 1987 increased by 27,350 tons compared to 1986, with an increase of 13 kilograms per mu. Practice has proven that strengthening the construction of agricultural commodity bases is important for improving agricultural labor productivity and accelerating the realization of agricultural modernization. It is a major strategic measure for building a socialist modern large-scale agriculture.

(1) It is beneficial to fully utilize the advantages of agricultural resources in various places. Agricultural production has the characteristic of being closely linked to the process of economic reproduction and natural reproduction. Generally speaking, it is more affected by natural conditions than other sectors of the national economy. According to the ecological suitability of various departments and types of agricultural production, reasonably arrange and plan the construction of agricultural commodity production bases in accordance with local conditions, so as to achieve suitable land use, optimal layout, and large-scale commodity production. This can better utilize the local agricultural natural resources and economic and technological conditions, effectively tap the potential for increased agricultural production, and achieve good economic results with less labor consumption.

(2) It is beneficial to gradually realize the regionalization, specialization, and socialization of agricultural production. Implementing regionalized, specialized, and socialized production is an inevitable trend in agricultural modernization. The "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Several Issues Concerning Accelerating Agricultural Development" points out: "To achieve agricultural modernization, the entire agricultural sector must have a reasonable layout and gradually implement regionalized and specialized production, continuously improving the level of socialized agricultural production." The construction of commercial agricultural product bases is the most advantageous form for agriculture to implement regionalized, specialized, and socialized production. Because agricultural commodity bases are planned and guided by the state and market demand, and are built in accordance with local conditions for the commercial production of one or two main agricultural products, the degree of specialization is high, the scale of production is large, and they can provide large quantities of commercial agricultural products to society. For example, Weishi and Qixian are both base counties for high-quality wheat and high-quality cotton. In 1987, the sowing area of wheat and cotton in the two counties accounted for 42.2% and 16.6% of the total sowing area of crops in the two counties, respectively. Among them, the sowing area of wheat accounted for 44.3% of the total sowing area of wheat in the city, and the sowing area of cotton accounted for 57.1% of the total sowing area of cotton in the city, which clearly reflects the characteristics of regionalized and specialized production of wheat and cotton.

(3) It is beneficial to improve the level of agricultural production technology and management. Because agricultural commodity production bases generally have the characteristics of being relatively concentrated, contiguous, and having a large scale of operations, it is beneficial to uniformly adopt advanced agricultural science and technology and promote the latest agricultural scientific and technological achievements within the base. It is also beneficial to train farmers in production and management technology, thereby improving the overall level of agricultural production technology and management.

(4) It is beneficial to accelerate agricultural infrastructure construction and achieve mechanization. Agricultural production within commodity bases is generally large-scale specialized production within a large area. The natural conditions and economic and technological conditions for agricultural production within the base are basically similar, and the agricultural production structure is relatively consistent. Therefore, it is convenient to reasonably plan and comprehensively deploy agricultural infrastructure construction according to the resource characteristics of the region and the ecological requirements of the dominant crops. At the same time, the large-scale specialized production of agricultural commodity bases is also conducive to the use of modern mechanical equipment, mechanized operations, and significantly improving labor productivity to achieve good economic benefits.

(5) It is beneficial to rationally allocate agricultural and sideline product processing industries. Because the agricultural and sideline product processing industries are allocated to the corresponding agricultural commodity bases, it is to make the industry as close as possible to the raw material source, thereby greatly reducing transportation costs and providing favorable conditions for achieving good economic benefits.

(6) It is beneficial to promote the integration of production, supply, and marketing, and achieve the integration of agriculture, industry, and commerce. The production of agricultural commodity bases is socialized commodity production, which urgently needs the supply of fertilizers, pesticides, agricultural films, and other agricultural production materials; seed breeding, prevention and control of crop pests and diseases, and livestock and poultry epidemics; a large number of agricultural and sideline products need processing, transportation, storage, and sales, and various agricultural scientific and technological achievements need to be promoted and popularized, etc. These highly specialized social services are difficult to achieve under the conditions of small-scale agricultural production, complex categories, and dispersed operations. However, within agricultural commodity bases, it is relatively easy to provide the above services. According to the overall planning of agricultural commodity base construction, a socialized service system and a deep processing system for agricultural and sideline products can be uniformly established, and the series development of the main products of the base can be done well, so that the agricultural commodity base can be built into an operating entity of "integrating agriculture, industry, and commerce, and production, supply, and marketing in one line."

(7) It is beneficial to guide agricultural production in accordance with local conditions and reasonably adjust and optimize the rural industrial structure. Because: first, agricultural commodity bases must be planned and constructed based on agricultural resource surveys and agricultural zoning, and guided by agricultural production according to such plans, many blind spots can be avoided and scientificity can be improved. Second, the types and scales of various agricultural commodity bases are determined according to the principles of ecological suitability, market stability, and good economic benefits, after feasibility studies. Their layout is generally reasonable, the scale is appropriate, and the production conditions are superior. Adjusting the industrial structure with such departments as the pillar will inevitably drive the coordinated development of the entire rural economy. Third, the construction of agricultural commodity bases is a long-term task. According to the overall planning of base construction, construction can be carried out in a planned, step-by-step, and focused manner, which has great feasibility and can avoid mistakes and "short-term behavior."

　　怎样建设现代化大农业？一条重要措施，就是——   
    建立商品农产品基地
    郭瑞钧
    河南省开封市地处黄淮平原重点开发区，为了加强农业商品基地建设，组织有关科技人员进行了全面考察，科学论证，制定了粮棉油肉等２０个基地建设与布局规划。其中粮、棉基地建设速度快，两年时间已表现出产品优势大，产量增长快，出售商品多，经济效益好的明显效果。粮食总产１９８７年比１９８６年增长８６０００吨，每亩单产增长１５公斤，１９８８年在连续大旱的情况下，通许、开封、兰考三个粮食基地县建旱涝保收田的乡有７５％，比前年增产两三成；棉花总产１９８７年比１９８６年增长２７３５０吨，每亩单产增长１３公斤。实践证明，加强农业商品基地建设，对提高农业劳动生产率，加速实现农业现代化具有重要作用，是建设社会主义现代化大农业的一项重大战略措施。
    （一）有利于充分发挥各地农业资源的优势。农业生产具有经济再生产过程与自然再生产过程联系密切的特点，一般说来，较其他国民经济部门受自然条件的影响更大。根据农业生产各部门和各种农作物的生态适宜性，合理安排、因地制宜规划建设农业商品生产基地，做到适地、择优布局，进行较大规模的商品生产，就能更好地利用当地的农业自然资源与经济技术条件，有效地挖掘农业增产的潜力，达到以较少的劳动消耗取得较好的经济效果。
    （二）有利于逐步实现农业生产的区域化、专业化和社会化。实行区域化、专业化、社会化生产是农业现代化发展的必然趋势。《中共中央关于加快农业发展若干问题的决定》指出：“实现农业现代化，整个农业必须有一个合理的布局，逐步实行区域化、专业化生产，不断提高农业生产的社会化水平。”建设商品农产品基地正是农业实行区域化、专业化和社会化生产的最为有利的形式。因为农业商品基地都是在国家统一规划和市场需求的指导和引导下，因地制宜地进行一二种主要农产品的商品性生产，专业化程度较高，生产规模较大，能为社会提供大宗商品性农产品。例如，尉氏和杞县都是优质小麦和优质棉花基地县，１９８７年两县小麦和棉花的播种面积分别占两县农作物播种总面积的４２．２％和１６．６％。其中小麦播种面积占全市小麦播种面积的４４．３％，棉花播种面积占全市棉花播种面积的５７．１％，明显地反映了小麦、棉花生产区域化、专业化的特征。
    （三）有利于提高农业生产技术和经营管理水平。因为农业商品生产基地，一般具有分布比较集中、连片，经营规模较大等特点，因而有利于在基地内统一采用先进的农业科学技术和推广最新农业科技成果，有利于对农民进行生产与管理技术的培训，从而提高整个农业生产技术和经营管理水平。
    （四）有利于加快农业的基本建设和实现机械化。农业商品基地内的农业生产一般都是较大地区范围内实行较大规模的专业化生产。基地内农业生产的自然条件和经济技术条件基本类似，农业生产结构比较一致。因此，便于根据地区资源特点和主导作物的生态要求，集中人力、物力、财力进行农田基本建设的合理规划和整体部署。同时，农业商品基地大规模的专业化生产，也有利于采用现代化机械装备，实行机械化作业，大幅度地提高劳动生产率，取得良好的经济效益。
    （五）有利于合理配置农副产品加工业。因为把农副产品加工业配置在相应的农业商品基地，就是使工业最大限度地接近原料地，从而可以大大节约运输费用，为获得良好的经济效益提供有利条件。
    （六）有利于推行产、供、销一条龙，实现农、工、商一体化。农业商品基地的生产是社会化的商品生产，迫切需要化肥、农药、农用薄膜等农业生产资料的供给；需要良种繁育，农作物病虫害和畜禽疫病的防治；大量的农副产品需要加工、运输、贮藏和销售，各种农业科学技术需要推广和普及，等等。这些专业性很强的社会服务在农业生产规模较小，门类复杂，经营分散的状况下是难以实现的。但在农业商品基地内，提供上述服务就比较容易。可以根据农业商品基地建设的总体规划，统一组建社会化服务体系和农副产品深度加工体系，搞好基地主导产品的系列开发，把农业商品基地建设成为“农工商结合，产供销一条龙”的经营实体。
    （七）有利于因地制宜地指导农业生产和合理调整、优化农村产业结构。因为：第一，农业商品基地必须是在农业资源调查和农业区划的基础上，经过进一步分析论证后规划建设的，按照这样的规划指导农业生产，就可以避免许多盲目性，提高科学性。第二，各种不同类型的农业商品基地及其建设规模都是根据生态适宜、市场稳定、经济效益好等原则，经过可行性研究后确定的，其布局一般比较合理，规模比较适度，生产条件比较优越。以这样的部门为支柱合理调整产业结构，必然带动整个农村经济协调发展。第三，建设农业商品基地是一项长期任务。按照基地建设总体规划部署，有计划、有步骤、有重点地进行建设，具有很大的可行性，可以避免失误和“短期行为”。
