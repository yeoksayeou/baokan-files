We had heard that many former Chinese table tennis team members were playing in West Germany. As reporters, we wanted to take the opportunity of covering the Dortmund World Table Tennis Championships to meet these old acquaintances and hear about their experiences playing abroad.

It was fortunate that on the day after the competition opened, we encountered the couple Xie Saike and Tong Ling. Xie was wearing a white shirt and looked the same as before. Tong was wearing a beautiful light yellow sweater and seemed a bit heavier, appearing more composed than before.

Xie has been abroad for three years, first playing and coaching in France, and last year he moved to the Saarbrücken club in West Germany. He told us that currently, there are more than 20 Chinese table tennis players scattered across various clubs in West Germany, including famous players like Guo Yuehua, Liang Geliang, and Cao Yanhua.

Xie said that in recent years, West Germany has paid great attention to the development of table tennis, organizing 10,000 table tennis clubs and having 700,000 members in the table tennis association. High-level clubs are eager to recruit foreign stars to join, expanding their influence. Playing in West Germany is lucrative, so why not come?

Considering the customs abroad, we did not ask about their income. However, from indirect sources, we learned that players like Guo Yuehua, with their annual salaries plus various competition prizes, earn at least 50,000 Marks (approximately 100,000 RMB). The clubs also provide housing and lend cars. Such treatment is not much compared to other European professional athletes, but it is very attractive to domestic athletes.

“Is the life of playing ball here tense?” we asked Xie.

“There are many competitions, including the European Club Cup, the German Cup, and the West German Championships. Most competitions use the home-and-away format, playing four-on-four team matches, with more matches than in China. During the competition season, we travel by car every week, arriving in one city to play, and then immediately driving to another city after the match.”

“Do you find it interesting?”

“Not really,” Xie seemed a bit tired of this life of playing ball for a living. “It’s completely different from representing the national team. Then, we were fighting for national honor and world championships. Now, it’s for personal gain, with less pressure. Winning or losing just means a bit more or less money. The boss hires me for as long as he wants, and I play for as long as he wants.”

Tong Ling, however, felt differently. She had only arrived last August and was playing for the Dülmen club not far from Dortmund. She found everything new and interesting here, and the treatment was good, with a comfortable life. She was the only Chinese in the club, and her teammates were very friendly. After competitions and training, they often invited her to play and taught her German. Tong said that her club had few players, mostly amateurs who came to play after school or work, with a high level of interest. Some even had their own tables at home. We asked her where the club’s funds came from. She said that the West German government stipulates that companies and enterprises must allocate 5% of their profits annually for cultural and educational activities. Therefore, many large companies actively sponsor or organize sports clubs.

“Will you represent a foreign team in international competitions in the future?” we asked.

The answer was negative. “Most of us have never even considered changing our Chinese nationality, so how could we represent a foreign team?”

　　异域他乡的打球生活
    ——访谢赛克、童玲
    早就听说有不少中国乒乓球队老队员在西德打球，记者很想趁采访多特蒙德世乒赛之机会会这些老熟人，听他们“侃侃”在国外的打球生涯。
    真巧，比赛开幕后的第二天，我们就先后碰上谢赛克小两口，还有童玲。赛克着白上衣，还是原来的样子。童玲穿了件漂亮的淡黄毛衣，略胖一点，显得比过去更沉稳。
    赛克出国已有三年，先在法国打球兼教练，去年转到西德萨尔布吕肯俱乐部打球。他告诉我们，目前，共有２０多名从中国来的乒乓球选手分散在西德各俱乐部，郭跃华、梁戈亮、曹燕华等名手都在这里。
    赛克说，近几年，西德重视开展乒乓球运动，组织了一万个乒乓球俱乐部，拥有７０万乒协会员。水平高的俱乐部都愿意聘请国外名将加盟，扩大影响。在西德打球收入高，人家邀请你，为何不来？
    鉴于国外的习惯，我们不便打听他们的收入。不过从侧面了解到，像郭跃华这些名将，年薪加各种比赛奖金，至少有五万马克（约合１０万元人民币），俱乐部还提供住房，并借给汽车。这样的待遇比起欧洲其它项目职业运动员算不得什么，但对国内运动员来说却非常有吸引力。
    “这里的打球生活紧张吗？”我们问赛克。
    “比赛相当多，有欧洲俱乐部杯赛、德国杯赛以及西德锦标赛。比赛多采用主客场制，打四人对四人的团体赛，场次比国内多得多。比赛季节里我们每周都要乘车跑，到一个城市下车就打，赛完马上开车前往另一城市。”
    “你觉得有意思吗？”
    “没什么意思。”赛克对这种作为谋生手段的打球生活似乎有点腻了，“和以前代表国家队打球完全不同，那时为国家荣誉奋斗，要争世界冠军，现在为个人打球，没那么大压力，打输打赢无非少几个钱多几个钱。老板聘多久我就打多久。”
    童玲则不然。她去年８月才来，在离多特蒙德不远的杜尔门俱乐部打球。她觉得这里一切新鲜、有意思，而且待遇不错，生活舒适。俱乐部里只有她一个中国人，球友们对她很友好，比赛训练之余常邀她一块玩，还教她说德语。童玲说，她那个俱乐部球员不多，大部分是业余选手，下学或下班后自愿来打球，兴趣很高，有的人家里还买了球台。我们问她俱乐部经费从何而来。她说，西德政府规定，公司企业每年要拿出利润的５％用于文教事业。因此许多大公司都积极赞助或组织体育俱乐部。
    “你们将来会代表外国队参加世界比赛吗？”我们问道。
    回答是否定的，“我们大多数人根本没有想过改变中国国籍的问题，怎么可能代表外国队呢？”
