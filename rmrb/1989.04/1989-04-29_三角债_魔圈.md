The Vicious Circle of "Triangular Debts"

Company A owes Company B, Company B owes Company C, and Company C owes Company A. Thus, the "triangular debts" among enterprises have reached an extreme. If this situation is not resolved, enterprises will find it difficult to survive.

Recently, the Liaoning Provincial Machinery Commission held a financial work meeting. Representatives from various large and medium-sized enterprises, known as the "financial gods," handed over several debt statements to the reporter with worried expressions:

The Shenyang Cable Factory has outstanding debts owed to it (hereafter referred to as "owed to") amounting to 1.117 billion yuan, while it owes others (hereafter referred to as "owing to") 0.34 billion yuan in goods.

The Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory has outstanding debts owed to it amounting to 670 million yuan, while it owes others 320 million yuan in goods.

The Wafangdian Bearing Factory has outstanding debts owed to it amounting to 550 million yuan in goods, while it owes others 250 million yuan in loans.

Due to the troubles caused by "triangular debts," a significant number of enterprises in Liaoning Province have been forced to halt production and await materials. In February, the mechanical industry's production value decreased by three percentage points compared to January.

Factory managers are stuck in this vicious circle, unable to rush or get angry, and can only rack their brains for solutions:

First: Selecting elite personnel to form debt collection teams. According to statistics from 12 large and medium-sized enterprises in Shenyang, hundreds of debt collectors have been dispatched recently.

Second: Seizing every second to visit debtors as early as possible.

Third: Adapting to circumstances and mastering a set of debt collection techniques. These include the art of gift-giving, the art of hosting banquets, the art of changing faces, and the art of persistent nagging.

What are the root causes of the "triangular debts" among enterprises? Firstly, the enterprises' cash reserves are depleted. Currently, most enterprises' own funds account for only about 5%, with 95% of their working capital coming from loans. After the state tightened credit, the enterprises' working capital loans were suddenly cut off. Secondly, the Contract Law is as solid as a rock, but who will enforce it? Thirdly, after implementing the fiscal responsibility system, local protectionism in banks is rampant. According to the bank's "collection and payment" transfer procedures, banks should not have the phrase "payment refused due to insufficient funds." However, now, many enterprises that send out goods receive several such notes every day.

### “三角债”魔圈

　　“三角债”魔圈
    甲方欠乙方——乙方欠丙方——丙方欠甲方，于是，企业之间有了“三角债”。眼下的“三角债”已登峰造极，再不解决，企业难于生存下去。
    前不久，辽宁省召开机械委财务工作会议，来自各大中型企业的“财神爷”，满面愁容地向记者递上了几份债单：
    沈阳电缆厂他人欠该厂（以下简称人欠）货款１．１１７亿元，该厂欠他人（以下简称欠人）货款０．３４亿元；
    沈阳重型机器厂人欠货款６７００万元，欠人货款３２００万元；
    瓦房店轴承厂人欠商品货款５５００万元，欠人贷款２５００万元；
    由于“三角债”的困扰，辽宁省已有相当一部分企业处于停工待料状态，今年２月份机械工业产值比１月份下降了三个百分点。
    厂长们在这个魔圈里，急不得，恼不得，只能绞尽脑汁寻对策：
    之一：挑选精兵强将，组成讨债队。据沈阳１２个大中型企业统计，日前派出的讨债人员就达３００多人。
    之二：分秒必争，尽早上门。
    之三：随机应变，掌握成套的讨债术。其中包括进贡术、宴请术、变脸术、缠磨术。
    造成企业间“三角债”魔圈的原因究竟在哪里？其一，企业的钱柜子空了。目前大部分企业的自有资金只占５％左右，企业的流动资金９５％是靠贷款。国家抽紧银根后，企业流动资金贷款一下被卡死。其二，合同法坚如磐石，可是谁来依法办事呢？其三，实行财政包干后，银行地方保护主义盛行。按银行“托收承付”转帐手续规定，银行不得出现“无款拒付”字样。可现在，许多发出商品的企业每天都能收到几张这样的票子。
