The Asian Cup Table Tennis Tournament is set to begin. According to a report from our newspaper, the Chinese Table Tennis Association, on behalf of the Asian Table Tennis Union, will host the seventh Cloudston Asian Cup Table Tennis Tournament in Beijing from May 13 to 16, 1989. This is the second time China has hosted this event since the first Asian Cup Table Tennis Tournament was held in Wuxi in 1983. The Chinese team participating in this tournament includes male athletes Chen Longcan, Yu Shenpeng, Chen Zhibin, and female athletes Qiao Hong and Ding Yaping.

The Asian Cup is held annually and features only men's and women's singles events. This year, a total of 32 male athletes and 16 female athletes will compete. The number of participants from each association is determined by the Asian Table Tennis Union based on the results of the ninth Asian Table Tennis Championships held last year. Each association can have a maximum of 3 male and 2 female participants. In addition to China, participants this year include athletes from Japan, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, South Korea, Chinese Taipei, India, and New Zealand. Notable athletes include Kim Jae-su, An Jae-hyeong, and Gwon Mi-suk from South Korea, Saito Seiichi and Matsushita Koichi from Japan, and Tsai Po-wah and Chan Dan-lai from Hong Kong. The star player from the Chinese Taipei team, Wu Wen-jia, who was originally scheduled to participate, may not be able to compete due to a recent injury.

The venue for this tournament is the newly built Shijingshan Sports Hall in the suburbs of Beijing, which is also one of the venues for the 11th Asian Games.
