Recently, I visited a friend's home for a gathering. Among the other two guests, one was a salesperson from a store, and the other was a worker. Their conversation during the gathering piqued my interest, and I have transcribed it below:

Worker: Yesterday, I bought a new pillowcase for 20 yuan. Last year, it was only 12 yuan each. The salesperson tried to persuade me to buy it then, but I didn't. How did the price go up so fast?

Salesperson: Actually, this involves the law of value. Some items are not expensive, and the market doesn't lack them. But once the "panic buying" trend starts, people buy whatever they see. Even substandard goods find buyers, and regular and scarce items become even more popular. Once the supply decreases, the price can't help but go up. Take pillowcases, for example. Their prices have been dropping for a few years, from 14-15 yuan each to as low as 11-12 yuan. Last summer, our store saw everyone rushing to buy, so we raised the price to 16 yuan each. We didn't expect more people to buy, and even at 19 yuan each, people still lined up to purchase them! Since the public is willing to buy, why wouldn't the store want to make money? So, we took the opportunity to raise the prices. Therefore, some prices are driven up by the residents' "panic buying."

Worker: Residents "panic buy" mainly to preserve value. From what you've revealed, it seems that "panic buying" didn't save much money but instead pushed up the price level of certain goods, ultimately causing us to lose out?

Salesperson: I can't say for sure, but in the future, don't buy things in a panic. It's necessary to understand a bit about the law of value and commodity knowledge.

　　售货随感
    锦力
    最近到朋友家聚会，其他两位客人一位是商店的售货员，另一位是工人。席间他们俩人的对话引起了我的兴趣，摘录如下：
    工人：昨天买了一个新被套，２０元钱。去年才卖１２元一条。当时售货员怎么劝我都没买。你说这价钱怎么涨得这么快？
    售货员：其实，这里面有价值规律的作用。有些东西本来不贵，市场上也不缺货。可是“抢购”风一来，人们见什么抢购什么，冷背残次商品都有了销路，一般的和紧缺的商品就更俏了。东西一少，价格还能不涨上去？就说被套吧，这几年价格一直下跌，每条从１４—１５元降到过１１—１２元。去年夏天我们商店见大家都抢着买，就把价格提到每条１６元，没想到买的人更多了，卖１９元一条还排长队呢！老百姓愿意买，商店哪有不愿赚钱的？就趁机提价吧。所以说，有些价格是被居民“抢”上去的。
    工人：居民“抢购”多是为了保值，听你透露“内情”，看来“抢购”没省下多少钱，倒把某些商品的物价水平推上去了，到头来还是自己吃亏？
    售货员：这我说不准，但今后买东西别乱抢，懂得一点价值规律和商品知识确有必要。
