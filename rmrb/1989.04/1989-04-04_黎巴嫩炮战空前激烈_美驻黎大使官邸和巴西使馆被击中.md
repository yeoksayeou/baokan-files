The fighting in Lebanon has reached unprecedented levels of intensity. The Christian militias led by General Michel Aoun continued their fierce artillery battles with Syrian forces and the Muslim militias they support in Beirut and its surrounding areas today.

According to a Lebanese security official, Syrian forces fired more than 8,000 shells at Christian militia-controlled areas in eastern and northeastern Beirut in the past 24 hours. At times, the rate of shelling reached 100 shells per minute.

The Christian military command issued a statement saying that its forces retaliated with 155mm howitzers, firing at least 3,000 shells at Syrian military positions in western Beirut, the central mountains, and the Bekaa Valley east of Beirut.

This morning, Christian militias shelled Syrian forces' artillery positions at Beirut International Airport and its vicinity. The airport has been closed since the two sides began fighting on March 8.

The security official said this round of fighting has been the most intense since the recent clashes began. So far, 138 people have been killed and 460 injured.

Despite appeals for a ceasefire from the United Nations Security Council and the Arab League in recent days, there is no sign that the fighting will stop.

Reports indicate that the U.S. Embassy, located near the presidential palace, and the Brazilian Embassy were also hit by shells.

　　黎巴嫩炮战空前激烈
    美驻黎大使官邸和巴西使馆被击中
    新华社贝鲁特４月２日电  由米歇尔·奥恩将军领导的黎巴嫩基督教武装部队今天在贝鲁特及其周围地区同叙利亚部队和它支持的穆斯林民兵继续进行空前的猛烈炮战。
    据黎巴嫩安全部门人士说，在过去的２４小时内，叙利亚部队向在贝鲁特东区和东北区基督教民兵控制的地区发射了８０００余发炮弹。有时每分钟发射炮弹数量达１００发之多。
    基督教武装指挥部在一项公报中说，它的部队使用１５５毫米的榴弹炮进行了还击，向贝鲁特西区、中部山区和贝鲁特东部的贝卡谷地的叙利亚军队阵地发射炮弹至少３０００发。
    基督教民兵今晨炮轰了叙利亚部队在贝鲁特国际机场及其附近的炮兵阵地。从３月８日黎巴嫩两派交火以来该机场一直关闭。
    安全部门人士说，这次炮战是最近双方发生冲突以来最猛烈的一次。目前已有１３８人死亡，４６０人受伤。
    尽管联合国安理会和阿拉伯联盟近几天来分别呼吁双方停火，战斗仍没有停止的迹象。
    据报道，位于总统府附近的美国驻黎大使官邸和巴西使馆也被炮弹击中。
