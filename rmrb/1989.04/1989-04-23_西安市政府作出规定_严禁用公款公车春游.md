Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, April 23rd. (Reporter Wang Shihuan) The spokesperson for the Xi'an Municipal Government recently announced at the tenth session of the third meeting of the Xi'an People's Congress that the Xi'an Municipal Government has issued a regulation strictly prohibiting the use of public funds and vehicles for spring outings.

Since the beginning of spring, some units in Xi'an have been using their own vehicles or renting cars at public expense to organize employees for spring outings. Some units have gone to Mount Hua, Famen Temple, while others have even gone to Luoyang in Henan and the Mogao Caves in Gansu. This not only directly affects production and increases fiscal expenditures but also sets a bad example.

According to the introduction, the Xi'an Municipal Government recently issued a regulation requiring all units not to occupy work and production time to organize employees for "spring outings"; not to use public funds (including extra-budgetary funds and enterprise welfare funds) to indirectly provide "spring outing" subsidies to employees; and not to use unit vehicles or public funds to rent cars to provide free transportation for employees' "spring outings."

This regulation also stipulates that employees who took public cars or rented cars at public expense for spring outings before the issuance of this regulation must pay back the fees.

　　西安市政府作出规定    
    严禁用公款公车春游
    新华社西安４月２３日电（记者王世焕）西安市人民政府发言人日前在西安市第十届三次人代会上宣布，西安市政府已做出规定，严禁用公款公车春游。
    入春以来，西安一些单位纷纷动用本单位车辆或公费租车组织职工春游，有的单位去华山、法门寺，有的甚至去河南洛阳、甘肃麦积山石窟等地。这不仅直接影响了生产，增加了财政开支，而且造成了极坏影响。
    据介绍，西安市政府日前做出的规定要求各单位不得占用工作、生产时间，组织职工“春游”；不准用公款（包括预算外资金、企业福利基金）变相给职工发“春游”补贴；不准用单位公车或公款租车，免费为职工“春游”提供交通工具。
    这项规定还要求，在市政府规定发布之前，乘公车或公费租车春游的职工要补交费用。
