The proliferation of publications leaves factories and mines overwhelmed

In November 1988, our mine's director was included as a figure in the business world in the "Dictionary of Contemporary Chinese Business Leaders." In December, our mine's enterprise profile was selected for the enterprise series "Profiles of Thriving Large and Medium-Sized Enterprises." This year in January, our mine received a letter from the Cultural and Art Service Department of the Yueyang Municipal Committee of the China Democratic League, requesting that we provide enterprise information for their compilation of the "Yueyang Market." These publishing units not only require our mine to provide relevant materials on time but also demand that our mine pay sponsorship fees for editing. Our mine is truly overwhelmed.

　　出版物名目繁多  使厂矿应接不暇
    一九八八年十一月，我矿矿长作为实业界人物载入《中国当代实业界名人词典》；十二月我矿企业简介被选入企业丛书《兴盛企业大中企业简介》卷；今年一月，我矿又接民盟岳阳市委员会文化艺术服务部信函，要求为他们汇编《岳阳市场》提供企业概况。这些出版单位，不仅要我矿按时提供有关资料，还要我矿交付赞助编撰费。我矿真有点应接不暇。
