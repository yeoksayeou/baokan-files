Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 10th.

To rationally adjust the agricultural production structure and regulate the income distribution in agriculture, the State Council recently issued the "Notice on Further Improving the Collection of Agricultural Specialty Taxes."

The notice states that further collecting agricultural specialty taxes (hereinafter referred to as agricultural specialty taxes) is crucial for regulating the income of planting and breeding industries, adjusting the income of different crops within the planting industry, guiding the adjustment of planting structures, and promoting the overall coordinated development of agriculture. It is particularly important for maintaining stable growth in grain production.

The notice requires that regions that have not yet started collecting agricultural specialty taxes should immediately organize the collection. All income from taxable products as specified must be fully collected. Except for approvals by the State Council and the Ministry of Finance, no unit or individual is allowed to arbitrarily decide on tax reductions, exemptions, or deferrals. In addition to the products previously specified by the State Council, this time fruit vegetables and marine aquaculture products are newly included in the taxable range. Agricultural specialty taxes are calculated based on the actual income of the products. Starting this year, the following agricultural specialty incomes will be subject to a unified national tax rate: freshwater and marine aquaculture income at 10%, with aquatic delicacies at 15%; fruit income at 10%, with citrus, bananas, lychees, and apples at 15%; fruit vegetable income at 10%; timber income at 8%, with a temporary deferral for forestry enterprises. The tax rate for other taxable product incomes shall not be less than 5%. For a few highly profitable products or those that encroach on grain fields, local authorities can appropriately increase the tax rate, but it shall not exceed 30%. Agricultural specialty taxes are allocated separately for collection tasks. While ensuring the completion of the agricultural tax collection tasks assigned by the central government, the newly increased agricultural specialty taxes will be fully retained by the local authorities, mainly for agricultural development.

The notice also requires that all levels of financial departments must strengthen the management of agricultural specialty tax collection. All levels of government and relevant departments must actively support the financial departments in lawful tax collection.

　　国务院发出通知
　　做好农林特产税征收工作
　　新将果用瓜和海水养殖产品列入征税范围
    新华社北京４月１０日电　为合理调整农业生产结构，理顺农业收入分配关系，国务院新近发出了《关于进一步做好农林特产农业税征收工作的通知》。
    通知指出，进一步征收农林特产农业税（以下简称农林特产税），对于调节种植业与养殖业的收入，调节种植业内部不同作物的收入，指导种植结构的调整，促进农业生产全面协调发展，特别是对保持粮食生产稳定增长，具有重要的作用。
    通知要求，目前尚未开征农林特产税的地区要立即组织征收。凡属规定的应税产品收入，必须全面征收。除国务院和财政部批准外，任何单位和个人一律不得擅自决定减税、免税或暂缓征税。征税范围除国务院以前规定的以外，这次新将果用瓜和海水养殖产品收入列入征税范围。农林特产税按照产品实际收入计算征税。从今年起，对下列农林特产收入实行全国统一税率：海淡水养殖收入为１０％，其中水珍品为１５％；水果收入为１０％，其中柑桔、香蕉、荔枝、苹果收入为１５％；果用瓜收入为１０％；原木收入为８％，对森工企业暂缓征收。其他应税产品收入的税率不得低于５％。对少数获利大或挤占粮田的产品收入，各地可以适当提高税率，但最高不得超过３０％。农林特产税单独分配征收任务，在保证完成中央核定农业税征收任务的前提下，新增农林特产税全部留给地方，主要用于发展农业。
    通知还要求各级财政机关要切实加强对农林特产税的征收管理，各级政府和有关部门都要积极支持财政机关依法征税。
