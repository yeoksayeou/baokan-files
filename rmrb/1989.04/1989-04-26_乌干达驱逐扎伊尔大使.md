Xinhua News Agency, Kampala, April 25th.

    Uganda's government announced the expulsion of Zaire's ambassador to Uganda, Mwanabushige, citing his involvement in activities inconsistent with his diplomatic status.

    A statement issued today by Uganda's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the ambassador's activities had harmed Uganda's relations with its neighboring countries and directly threatened Uganda's security.

    The statement added that Uganda's decision to expel the ambassador does not aim to affect bilateral relations or Uganda's stance towards Zaire's head of state and government.

    In recent years, Uganda and Zaire have been accusing each other of supporting anti-government forces.

　　乌干达驱逐扎伊尔大使
    新华社坎帕拉４月２５日电  乌干达政府宣布驱逐扎伊尔驻乌干达大使万亚布希格，理由是他从事了与他身份不相符的活动。
    乌干达外交部今天发表的一份声明说，扎伊尔大使的活动伤害了乌干达同其邻国的关系，也直接危害到乌干达的安全。
    声明说，乌驱逐扎大使并不想影响两国的关系及其对扎伊尔国家元首和政府的态度。
    近几年来，乌扎两国一直在相互指责对方支持其反政府力量。
