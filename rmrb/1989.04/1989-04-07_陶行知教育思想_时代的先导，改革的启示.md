Tao Xingzhi graduated from Columbia University's Teachers College and returned to China during the height of the New Culture Movement. He dedicated himself fully to the education sector, first teaching at Nanjing Higher Normal School and Southeast University, and later serving as the general secretary of the China National Association for the Advancement of Education. However, with the end of the First United Front and the failure of the National Revolution, China remained in a state of internal and external turmoil, with widespread poverty, illiteracy, and backward education. What was the way forward for Chinese education? What was the way forward for the Chinese nation? Through long-term experimentation and exploration, he finally had an epiphany: if education is considered in isolation and reforms are carried out independently, the effort will be doubled and the results will be halved, making it difficult to achieve success. Therefore, the development of education must be integrated with the overall reform of society.

Why was China so poor and backward? He attributed it to three main reasons: "First, economic aggression by foreign countries; second, the large population that consumes all the accumulated wealth; third, scientific education emphasizes theory over practice." While many people at the time saw the issue of foreign aggression, the ruling class adopted a policy of non-resistance. However, the upper and lower levels lacked awareness of the latter two issues. To awaken the nation, Tao Xingzhi published works such as "The Way Out for the Chinese Nation and the Way Out for Chinese Education" in 1931. To help more people see the problem clearly, he used vivid analogies: one afternoon, he went through the south gate of Nanjing to run an errand, and the crowd was so dense that it took him an hour to get through, leaving him drenched in sweat. This was a "microcosm of the predicament of Chinese education": the population was too large, and the paths forward were narrow and few, like many people "crowding through a city gate." He believed that this was not only the crux of China's educational problems but also a major issue for national development. Uncontrolled population growth had become a heavy burden and a significant obstacle to economic and educational development.

Tao Xingzhi's foresight came from his pragmatic spirit. He was a very practical person. Coming from a rural background, he deeply understood the plight of Chinese farmers who were economically exploited, politically oppressed, and culturally marginalized. He believed that China was an "agricultural nation" with "more than 85% of the population in rural areas." The fate of the farmers determined the strength of the nation and the prosperity of the people. Based on this understanding, he advocated that to transform Chinese society, one must first transform rural society. To transform the countryside, education must be brought to the villages to awaken the rural masses and cultivate a new generation; he advocated for the popularization of education, starting with farmers, and proposed that "rural education is the fundamental strategy for national development." He also foresaw that "rural education is a great phenomenon in the Far East, and anyone concerned with world problems cannot ignore this major issue." He was one of the earliest modern Chinese educators to pay attention to the farmer problem. To shift the focus of educational work to rural areas, he drafted and published significant articles such as "The Declaration of the China National Association for the Advancement of Education for the Transformation of National Rural Education," "The Fundamental Reform of Chinese Rural Education," and "Our Creed," calling for "serving the 340 million farmers." He also proposed the idea of establishing 100 million schools and transforming 100 million villages. He practiced what he preached, choosing not to be a university president, and in the mid-1920s, he wore straw shoes and a straw hat to the wilderness along the Yangtze River to establish a rural normal school, building a new type of educational system centered on transforming rural life. Although he faced numerous obstacles, he was undeterred. His lofty spirit and far-sighted vision not only inspired educators but also influenced the Chinese Communist Party. This assessment is not an overstatement of Tao Xingzhi's contributions. It can be supported by a passage from Zhou Enlai's report "Learning from Mao Zedong" at the National Youth Representatives Conference on May 7, 1949: "'After the May Fourth Movement, Chairman Mao participated in the revolutionary movement and first focused on urban worker movements. At that time, Mr. Tao Xingzhi advocated rural movements. Comrade Yun Daiying wrote to Chairman Mao, suggesting that we could learn from Tao Xingzhi and go to the countryside to do some work. Chairman Mao said that we are already busy with urban work, how can we go to the countryside? This shows that Chairman Mao did not consider that aspect at the time. But later, Chairman Mao quickly turned to the countryside and successfully led the peasant movement, combining urban and rural revolutionary movements'." Tao Xingzhi's emphasis on the farmer problem, his focus on rural education, and his idea of using science to transform the countryside are still relevant today.

Tao Xingzhi was a dedicated educator who devoted his life to the cause of education, as he said, "I came with a heart full of passion and left with nothing but my clothes." He said, "Over the past decade, I have sometimes advocated for mass education, sometimes for rural education, and sometimes for the education of the working masses. Those who do not understand might think I am fickle and like to come up with new ideas, but in fact, I have only one central issue in mind: how to popularize education and how to provide education to those who have not had the opportunity to receive it." He returned to his homeland with the grand vision of "providing educational opportunities for all the people of the nation." Due to this ambition and aspiration, he creatively proposed a "mass education" that fundamentally differed from the old education system, which focused only on a few people's "elite education." He strongly advocated for the "greatest mission of the popularization of education," which is to "take the key (modern civilization) from the hands of a few and give it to the masses," "to make education and knowledge into fresh air, widely available to the masses, so that everyone can breathe freely according to their needs, thereby increasing the vitality of the masses with new life." He was dissatisfied with some people who used "emphasizing education" as a slogan, with "the roar of a lion and the pace of a snail." He cited the example of Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City, "According to the methods used in Zhejiang in the past four years to eliminate illiteracy, it would take 400 years to complete the task for the entire province; according to the methods used in Hangzhou in the past six years to eliminate illiteracy, it would take 150 years to complete the task for the entire city." He also investigated the national situation, saying, "In my estimation, using traditional methods, it would take 100 years to popularize education for school-age children, and it would take another 400 years to popularize education for adults who have dropped out of school." Such a pace was completely out of sync with the rapid development of science in the world! Therefore, he proposed a series of practical and feasible methods, such as promoting "science to the people" activities, implementing the "little teacher system," "immediate transmission of knowledge," and advocating for multiple types, channels, forms, and tracks of schooling, a whole set of mass line methods to popularize education. Of course, in that era and under those conditions, even the best methods and suggestions were of no avail. But this also proves from another angle that Tao Xingzhi was a pioneer and an enlightened educator dedicated to modern education.

Tao Xingzhi believed that the seriousness of China's educational problems at the time was not just about the lack of schools and the slow pace of educational popularization, but more importantly, "China's education has always been on the wrong path." He said, "China has such a long history of culture, and logically, it should be at the forefront of the times. Why is it that now we cannot keep up with the European and American countries, and we are lagging behind in every aspect? The reasons are complex, but the misguided education policy in the past can be considered the main cause." Especially China's rural education, completely detached from the needs of farmers and agriculture, deviated from the reality of rural areas. "He teaches people to eat without planting rice, to wear clothes without planting cotton, to build houses without planting trees." "He teaches people to let fallow fields remain uncultivated, to let barren mountains remain unplanted. He teaches people to divide profits without generating profits. He teaches people to suffer from bandits, thugs, and tigers without being able to defend themselves, and to encounter floods, droughts, and pests without knowing how to prevent them. He teaches the children of farmers to become bookworms. He teaches the rich to become poor, and the poor to become even poorer; the strong to become weak, and the weak to become even weaker." He warned people, "This kind of education cannot and should not be popularized. There is a precipice ahead, comrades must rein in the horse and find another way." He believed that the tragedy of traditional Chinese education was that the entire education system revolved around "examinations," "students study for exams, teachers teach for exams, and schools become exam preparation centers. What the exams require must be taught, and what the exams do not require must not be taught." "What needs to be taught is only the book, only the exam book. Only the exam guide!" Education is equivalent to reading, and reading is equivalent to taking exams. History has advanced, but the ghost of the imperial examination system lingers. Intellectuals, apart from "taking exams" and following the path of "learning to serve the government," seem to have no other way out. They grow old, their backs bent, and they can only end their days in the examination hall. Tao Xingzhi sharply referred to this education as the "wheel of rebirth of bookworms in a haze of smoke." It is precisely because of this that the tragicomedy of "Fan Jin's success in the imperial examination" described in "The Scholars" has been repeated throughout the ages. This kind of education can only cultivate "pale," "incompetent," and "uncreative" "bookworms," "craftsmen," and "farmers," and the whole of China will become a "Republic of Bookworms"! "If this kind of education is not thoroughly reformed, then the old forces cannot be maintained, and the new forces cannot be generated. Our nation may become increasingly impoverished and weak, to the point of extinction." Among all the anti-feudal educators, Tao Xingzhi was one of the few who made such a profound exposure and criticism of the old education system. He believed that "now it has come to the point where we must find another way out." He loudly proclaimed, "China's education needs a comprehensive self-reflection, self-repentance, and self-renewal," and carry out fundamental reforms.

Tao Xingzhi's most far-reaching and significant contribution was his profound and rich "life education" theory.

Tao Xingzhi's "life education" theory is a brilliant and comprehensive plan that integrates educational reform with social reform, characterized by its liveliness, practicality, and wholeness.

He believed that education should not be separated from life but should come from life, transform life, and serve the improvement and progress of life. Educational guiding ideology and policies must "examine the national situation" and be in harmony with the country's economic, cultural, and political life, serving it. Education and actual life should be like one skin, and education cannot be independent of life, life independent of education. Starting from the reality of China's large size, poverty, backwardness, and rapid scientific development in the modern world, "research and experiment with various school educations that suit the national conditions and meet the needs of life." This is a new type of educational system centered on practice and life, involving the whole society and the whole people. At that time, he believed that education should undertake the task of China's transition from an agricultural society to an industrial society. In rural areas, establish "living education that suits rural life," "living rural education should teach people to make a living. It should turn barren mountains into forests and barren land into grain fields." He metaphorically called it "education and agriculture hand in hand." In cities, modern education should also be established, aiming at the world trend, starting from the diversification of life and the multiple demands of construction, taking multiple channels, forms, and tracks of schooling, changing the predicament of tens of millions of people "crowding through a city gate" and thousands of soldiers and horses "crossing a single log bridge." It is precisely on this issue of the relationship between education and life that we have taken such a detour! How to change the situation of education being detached from reality and lagging behind the times has become a major issue of concern to all countries in the world, and it is even more urgent in our country.

To carry out such education, of course, one must rely on society and take the path of social education. Tao Xingzhi said: not only "education and agriculture hand in hand," but also "must join hands with other great forces," with various industries, taking the broad path of joint and social education. The problem we have been debating for many years, Tao Xingzhi half a century ago has already made attempts in theory and practice. Just as the Japanese invaders were advancing rapidly, and the country was in danger, he believed that "in times of national crisis, the fundamental education of the country is even more urgent to be implemented," and he established the famous Yucai School in Chongqing, relying on the help of all sectors of society to solve the problems of funds, school buildings, and teachers. In 1941, when prices soared, the teachers and students of Yucai School faced the prospect of starvation. Tao Xingzhi advocated the "new martial arts spirit," opening up sources of income and cutting expenses, selling calligraphy, paintings, paid performances, labor production... raising funds from society, and finally overcoming the difficulties, making Yucai School stand firmly by the Jialing River, cultivating a large number of talents. "Not using the power of society is incompetent education; not understanding the needs of society is blind education," this is his experience.

Using social forces to jointly run schools is not only to solve the difficulties of financial and material resources but more importantly to closely link education with society, thereby giving education new life. In the mid-1930s, Tao Xingzhi and his comrades-in-arms established a new type of educational organization in Shanghai - the Work-Study Team, implementing the principle of "work to support life, study to enlighten life, and team to protect life." It was a cell of society, a grassroots unit, a production unit, and also an educational unit. Later, various types of work-study teams were developed, becoming self-defense organizations for resistance and salvation. It educated people, transformed people, and produced self-help, with a tenacious vitality, and its profound significance far exceeded that of an organization for popular education.

　　陶行知教育思想
    ——时代的先导，改革的启示
    ·胡国枢·
    发展教育必须与社会改革作统盘筹划
    陶行知从美国哥伦比亚大学师范学院毕业归国，正是新文化运动高涨之时，他倾注全力于教育事业，先在南京高等师范和东南大学等校担任教授，不久专任中华教育改进社的总干事。然而，随着第一次国共合作的告终，国民革命失败，中国仍然陷入内忧外患、民不聊生、教育落后、文盲遍地的悲惨景况。中国教育的出路何在？中华民族的出路何在？通过长期的实验摸索，终于豁然开朗：就教育论教育，孤立地进行教改，事倍功半，难以奏效；发展教育必须与社会整体改革作统盘筹划。
    中国为什么这么贫穷落后？他回答是三个原因：“一、外国的经济侵略；二、人口太多，把储蓄的财富都吃光了；三、科学教育重讲不重做”（引文凡见《陶行知全集》的，均不再加注）。对外国侵略，那时许多人看到了，“只是当政者采取不抵抗主义”，对于后二个原因，上上下下却缺乏认识。为了唤醒国人，陶行知于１９３１年发表了《中华民族的出路与中国教育的出路》等洋洋大著。为了使更多的人看清问题，他以生动的比喻说：一天下午出南京南门办事，进出的人很多，把城门洞挤满了，“挤不进去”，“又退不出”，“费了一小时，挤得我满身大汗！”这就是当时“中国教育出路的缩影”：人口太多而出路的口子又窄又少，好像很多人“挤城门洞”。他认为，这既是中国教育的症结所在，也是民族发展的大问题，人口漫无节制，已成了经济发展与教育发展的沉重负担与重大阻力。
    注重农民问题，重视乡村教育
    陶行知的远见来自求实精神，他是一个非常务实的人。他来自农村，深知中国农民在经济上受残酷剥削、政治上受深重压迫、文化上毫无地位的痛苦。他认为中国是“以农立国”的国家，有“８５％以上的人口在乡村”，农民的境况如何，决定着国家的强弱，民族的兴衰。基于这种理解，他主张要改造中国社会，必先改造中国农村社会。要改造乡村，必须“使教育下乡”，用教育的力量来唤醒农民群众，培养一代新人；主张普及教育首先要向农民普及，提出了“乡村教育是立国的根本大计”的论断。他还高瞻远瞩地指出：“乡村教育是远东的一种伟大的现象，凡关心世界问题的人们，决不可忽略这种大问题”。他是现代中国最早注意农民问题的教育家。为了把教育工作的重点转到乡村，他起草与发表了《中华教育改进社改造全国乡村教育宣言书》、《中国乡村教育之根本改造》、《我们的信条》等意义深远的文章，号召“为我们３４０００万农民服务”。并且提出筹办１００万所学校，改造１００万个乡村的设想。他身体力行，宁愿不当大学校长，２０年代中期即穿上草鞋、戴起凉帽到长江边的荒野里创办乡村师范学校，建立以改造乡村生活为中心的新型教育体系。他虽然到处碰壁，但不怕困难。他“为中国教育寻觅曙光”的崇高精神与远大目光，不仅鼓舞着教育界的有志之士，而且影响了中国共产党人。作这般估计，并非是凭空抬高陶行知，可用周恩来于１９４９年５月７日在全国青年代表大会上的报告《学习毛泽东》中的一段话作证：“‘五四’以后，毛主席参加了革命运动，就先在城市专心致志地搞工人运动。那时陶行知先生提倡乡村运动。恽代英同志给毛主席写信说，我们也可以学习陶行知到乡村里搞一搞。毛主席说，现在城市工作还忙不过来，怎么能再去搞乡村呢？这就说明毛主席当时没有顾到另一方面。但后来毛主席很快就转到乡村，又把农民运动搞通了，使城市和乡村的革命运动结合起来”（《周恩来选集》上册第３３３页）。陶行知注重农民问题，重视乡村教育，用科学改造乡村的思想，即使在今天，也仍然具有现实意义。
    “使全国人民都有受教育的机会”
    陶行知是为人民教育事业鞠躬尽瘁的典范，正如他说的，“捧着一颗心来，不带半根草去”，一心扑在教育上。他说：“这十几年来，我有时提倡平民教育，有时提倡乡村教育，有时提倡劳苦大众的教育，不知道的人以为我见异思迁，喜欢翻新花样，其实我心中只有一个中心问题，这个中心问题，就是如何使教育普及，如何使没有机会受教育的人可以得到他们所需要的教育”。他是抱着“使全国人民都有受教育的机会”的宏愿回到祖国的。由于这种抱负与志向，他才能创造性地提出与旧教育只着眼于少数人的“小众教育”有根本区别的“大众教育”，力主“普及教育运动之最大使命，便是要把这个钥匙（指现代文明——引者）从少数人的手里拿出来交给大众”，“要把教育、知识化做新鲜空气，普遍地广及于大众，人人可以按其需要，自由呼吸，因而增加大众以新的生命活力”。他对当时有些人把“重视教育”当作口头禅，“狮子的口气，蜗牛的脚步”甚为不满。他举浙江省与杭州市为例，“依照最近四年来浙江所用的方法来扫除文盲，全省要４００年才能完成；依照最近６年来杭州所用的方法来扫除文盲，全市要１５０年才能完成”。他又调查了全国的情况说：“依我估计，用传统方法，学龄儿童的教育要过１００年才能普及，失学成人之教育，要再过４００年才能普及”。这样的速度与世界科学的飞速发展太不相称了！于是，他提出了一系列切实可行的方法，如开展“科学下嫁”活动，推行“小先生制”、“即知即传”，提倡多门类、多渠道、多形式、多轨制的办学道路等一整套群众路线方法来普及教育。当然，在那个年代、那种气候里，再好的办法和建议也是无济于事的。但这恰从另一个方面证明陶行知是献身现代教育的先驱者、先觉者。
    “中国的教育应当有一个总反省”
    陶行知认为，当时中国教育问题的严重性，并不仅仅是学校数量少、教育普及速度慢，更在于“中国向来办的教育，完全走错了路”。他说：“中国有这样悠久的文化，照理讲来应该站在时代的最前线。为什么现在不但不能和欧美各国并驾齐驱，而且还处处跟人不上？这个原因很复杂，但是过去教育政策的失策，可以算作主因”。尤其是中国的乡村教育，完全脱离农民的需要、农业的需要，背离了农村的实际。“他教人吃饭不种稻，穿衣不种棉，做房子不造林”。“他教人有荒田不知开垦，有荒山不知造林。他教人分利不生利。他教人受土匪、土棍、土老虎的侵害而不能自卫，遇了水旱虫灾而不知预防。他教农夫的子弟变成书呆子。他教富的变穷，穷的格外穷；强的变弱，弱的格外弱”。他告诫人们，“这种教育决不能普及，也不应普及。前面是万丈悬崖，同志们务须把马勒住，另找出路”。他认为中国传统教育的悲剧是整个教育围着“会考”转，“学生是学会考，教员是教人会考，学校变了会考筹备处。会考所要的，必须教，会考所不要的，必不教。”“所要教的只是书，只是考的书。只是会考指南！教育等于读书，读书等于赶考”。历史前进了，而封建科举制的阴魂不散，知识分子除了“赶考”，走“学而优则仕”的路以外，似乎再无旁的生路，白了胡须，驼了背脊，也只得终老考场。对这种教育，陶行知尖锐地称它是“书呆子轮回麻醉的乌烟”。正由于此，《儒林外史》描绘的“范进中举”那样痛人心肺的笑话历代层出不穷。这种教育只能培养“没有血色”、“没有本领”、“不会创造”的“书呆子”、“工呆子”、“农呆子”，整个中国要变成“中华书呆国”了！“这种教育，倘不彻底改革，则旧的力量不能维持，新的力量不能产生，我们的民族恐怕要日益贫弱，以至于灭亡”。对旧教育制度作这样深刻的揭露与批判的，在所有反封建的教育家中，陶行知数得上是鹤立鸡群。他认为“现在已经到了山穷水尽，不得不另找生路的时候了”。他大声疾呼：“中国的教育应当有一个总反省、总忏悔、总自新”，进行根本的改革。
    “生活教育”理论
    陶行知影响最为深远、贡献最为卓著的，是他为后世留下了丰富而深刻的“生活教育”理论。
    陶行知的“生活教育”理论，是融教育改革与社会改革于一体的绚烂宏图，是以生活性、实践性、整体性为特征的教育学说。
    他认为教育不能脱离生活，应是来自生活、改造生活，为生活的提高与前进服务。教育指导思想、教育政策必须：“审查国情”，与整个国家的经济、文化、政治生活相协调并为它服务。教育与实际生活应是一张皮，而不能教育自教育、生活自生活。从中国老大、贫穷、落后而又处在科学迅速发展的现代世界这一实际状况出发，“研究试验符合本国国情、适合生活需要之各种学校教育”。这是以实践为中心、以生活为主体的、全社会全民性的新型教育体系。在当时，他认为教育应担当起“中国由农业社会向工业社会过渡”的任务。在农村建立“适合乡村实际生活的活教育”，“活的乡村教育要教人生利。他要叫荒山成林、叫瘠地长五谷”。他形象地称之为“教育与农业携手”。在城市也应建立“瞄准世界潮流”的现代教育，从生活的多样化、建设的多要求出发，走多渠道、多形式、多轨制的办学道路，改变亿万人“挤城门洞”、千军万马“过独木桥”的困境。正是在这一个教育与生活关系问题上，我们走过多大的弯路呵！怎样改变教育脱离实际、落后于时代的状况，已成为当前世界各国普遍关心的大问题，在我国更为迫切。
    办教育，必须依靠社会
    办这样的教育，当然得依靠社会，走社会办学的路子。陶行知说：不仅“教育与农业携手”，“更须与别的伟大势力携手”，与各行各业携手，走联合办学、社会办学的康庄大道。我们争论多年的问题，陶行知在半个世纪前已在理论与实践的结合上作了尝试。正当日本侵略者长驱直入，国家危在旦夕的时刻，他认为“国难当头，愈益觉得立国根本之教育，更有从速举办之必要”，他在香港办起了中华职业补习学校，又到重庆创立了著名的育才学校，无论资金、校舍及师资都靠社会各界帮助解决。１９４１年物价飞涨，育才学校师生面临断炊之虞，陶行知提倡“新武训精神”，一面开源，一面节流，卖字、卖画、有偿演出、生产劳动……向社会筹集资金，终于战胜了困难，使育才学校得以屹立在嘉陵江边，培育了大批英才。“不运用社会的力量，便是无能的教育；不了解社会的要求，便是盲目的教育”，这正是他的经验之谈。
    运用社会力量联合办学，不只是解决财力物力的困难，更重要的是教育与社会密切联系，从而使教育获得新的生命。３０年代中期，陶行知与他的战友们，在上海创办了一种新型的教育组织——工学团，实行他提出的“工以养生，学以明生，团以保生”的原则，它是社会的细胞、基层单位，也是生产单位，又是教育单位。后来发展了多种多样的工学团，成了抗战救亡的自卫团体。它育人、化人、生产自助，有顽强的生活力，其深远意义大大超出了作为普及教育的组织。
