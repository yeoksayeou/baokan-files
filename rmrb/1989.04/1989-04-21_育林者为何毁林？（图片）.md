Title: Why Are Foresters Destroying the Forest?

	The entire nation is engaged in afforestation, yet the Yunshan Forest Farm in Luobei County, on February 28, during the demarcation of mountain boundaries, disregarded the provincial government's repeated orders to maintain the status quo and not to engage in indiscriminate felling. They hired local laborers to enter the forestry area of the Yanjun Farm, destroying over 80,000 young trees in just 9 days. The felled young trees are scattered across the entire forestry area (see the top image). The ox yokes used by the laborers also crushed a large number of young saplings (see the right image).

	Why do foresters engage in such destructive activities? Is it due to ignorance or has their parochialism reached an uncontrollable level?!

    育林者为何毁林？
    全国都在植树造林，而萝北县云山林场却于2月28日借山权划界之际，不顾省政府多次下达维持现状，不准乱伐的指令，雇用民工进入延军农场育林山，9天内毁幼林8万余株，砍伐的幼树布满整个育林地（见上图），民工使用的牛套子还压毁大批的育林树苗（见右图）。
    育林者为什么要干毁林的事？是愚昧无知，还是本位主义膨胀到不可自持的地步？！
