The Hunan Provincial and Changde Municipal Party Discipline Inspection Commissions, Supervision Bureaus, and Bureaus conducted an investigation and have now uncovered some of the officials' problems.

	Li Xin Guo, the former deputy magistrate, and the deputy director of the county finance commission, borrowed 40 tons of flood control stones in April last year to lay the foundation for their private houses. Li used his position to illegally occupy 0.415 acres of land, causing a loss of over 6,400 yuan to the state and collective interests. The county People's Congress Standing Committee dismissed him from his post as deputy magistrate on March 26.

	Xiao Jin, the chairman of the county People's Congress, used his position to move 5 cubic meters of flood control reserve timber and illegally occupied 0.201 acres of land, causing a loss of 2,566 yuan to the state and collective interests. The Changde Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Discipline Inspection Commission decided to give him a severe party warning.
