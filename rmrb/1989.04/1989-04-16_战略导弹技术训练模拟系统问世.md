A large-scale comprehensive strategic missile technology training simulation system, primarily used for combat training of our military's strategic missile forces and assisting in technical decision-making, has been successfully developed after more than 100 teachers from the Second Artillery Engineering Academy worked tirelessly for three years. The system was officially approved by experts in Xi'an recently.

The large-scale comprehensive strategic missile technology training simulation system can realistically simulate the instruments on the missile and the main ground equipment, as well as the entire process of combat training, including launch preparation, inspection and testing, missile flight and impact point prediction, and shooting result analysis.

The successful development of the strategic missile technology training simulation system solves the problems of complex weapon technology, expensive equipment, and short service life in the training of the Second Artillery Forces. It provides advanced means for the training and education of the troops and academies. The simulation system's operations are realistic, the instrument displays are consistent with actual equipment operations, the sound effects are authentic, the background atmosphere is rich, and it can set up common faults, monitor the training process, and evaluate training quality.
