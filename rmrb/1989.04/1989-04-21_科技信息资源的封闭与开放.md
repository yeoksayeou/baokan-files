In China, there have always been many things that are kept secret. Other matters aside, I particularly do not understand why in many places, scientific and academic materials that are not technical secrets have become rare treasures that experts and scholars can only dream of accessing?

The bureaucratic habits of a certain library in Shanghai are something that many people in the academic community have already experienced. A middle-aged lecturer from Fudan University, trembling with fear, visited several times, accompanied by many smiles, but ultimately, due to not having the right status, was unable to see the old newspaper and historical materials needed for his research. As a result, this gentleman was forced to shout an obscenity at that cold face. In Beijing, a certain unit spent a large amount of foreign exchange to introduce an advanced satellite receiving system. A nearby research institute needed a few pieces of meteorological data and repeatedly discussed the matter of paid transfer with them, but the other party firmly refused. Thus, this research institute, in a fit of pique, spent a large amount of manpower and resources to develop a receiving terminal to meet their research needs. This pique was out of desperation, but the money spent was still the country's money, wasn't it?

Sometimes, it really feels like you can't escape the highly centralized planned economy that has woven this vast network over the long term. One false move and you'll be dizzy and disoriented. The closed state of research materials is another example. Every unit operates on a self-owned basis, and when collecting materials, they are afraid of not being thorough enough. Once they are stored, they all enter a state of hibernation, and it is extremely difficult for outsiders to even take a look. There are various procedures and regulations governing this. Unless you are an official—preferably a high-ranking one—it is easy to handle. But the problem is that officials don't bother to look, while those who want to look are often not officials. This is a real mess!

It's quite heavy. Watching science and technology advance rapidly, no matter how capable a person or unit is, it is impossible to gather all scientific and technological information. To improve research efficiency, we must increase the degree of resource sharing. Of course, to establish a systematic resource library with functions such as collection, analysis, synthesis, storage, and retrieval, a series of modern technological means are required as a backing. Perhaps this condition is not yet met in many places. But what we often encounter are man-made walls. The urgent task at hand is to break down the wall of unit ownership of resources under the current conditions and ultimately make the commodification and socialization of information resources an institution.

It is said that due to the failure to fully utilize scientific and technological information resources, the United States suffers losses from repeated research amounting to 10 to 13 billion dollars annually, and the Soviet Union also has 10 to 19 billion rubles. China does not know if there is such a statistic, but if there is, it would probably be shocking. Already, some economists, out of desperation, have turned to foreign publications to find scientific and technological information related to China.

### 科技信息资源的封闭与开放

　　科技信息资源的封闭与开放
    李泓冰
    在咱们中国，自来就有不少事情是秘而不宣的。别的倒也罢了，我独独不懂，怎么在许多地方，并非技术秘诀的科技与学术资料对专家学者们也成了可望不可即的珍笈秘本了？
    上海某图书馆的衙门习气是许多学术界中人早已领教过的。复旦大学一位中年讲师战战兢兢地几次登门，陪了许多笑脸，终因不够级别，无缘一睹研究所需的旧报史料，结果逼得这位谦谦君子竟对着那冷脸孔吼出了一句国骂。北京有家单位，花了国家大把外汇，引进一套先进的卫星接收系统，邻近的某研究所需要几份气象资料，一再与之商议有偿转让事宜，对方坚辞不允。于是这家研究所赌气花了大量人力财力研制出一套接收终端，以供科研之需。赌这口气是被逼无奈，花的却还不是国家的钱吗？
    有时候真觉得?仰呼吸之间总逃不脱高度集中的计划经济长期以来织就的这张巨网，一不小心就会碰得你晕头转向。研究资料的闭锁状态便又是一例。家家都搞单位所有制，搜集资料时唯恐不够周详，一旦入库便一律进入冬眠，外人想看上一眼比登天还难，有种种的手续和规定管着。除了你是当官的——还得是大官——才好办，但要命的是当官的不希罕看，希罕看的偏又往往不是官。这就闹了个满拧！
    说起来真有点沉重。眼巴巴地看着科学技术脚不点地的往前赶，任你什么人什么单位纵有三头六臂也不可能把所有科技资料网罗在手。要想提高研究效率，只有扩大资料共享程度。固然，要建立一套系统的，具有收集、分析综合、存贮和检索诸项功能的资料库，必得有一系列现代化的技术手段做后盾，可能这条件在很多地方尚不具备。但我们经常碰到的是一些人为的墙，当务之急是在现有条件下，打通资料的单位所有制这堵墙，并最终使信息资料的商品化、社会化成为制度。
    据说，由于没有充分利用科技情报资料而造成重复科研的损失，美国每年达１０至１３亿美元，苏联也有１０到１９亿卢布。中国不知有没有这项统计，若有，大约也会吓人一跳。已经有经济学家迫于无奈，调头从国外报刊上寻找有关中国的科技信息了。
