Chinese famous scenic spots
are printed on various New Year's cards,
carrying admiration, carrying respect,
carrying emotions and love,
flying gracefully in the festive atmosphere.
It can be said that the colors on them
are everywhere condensed with the blood and sweat of our Chinese ancestors.
We go to read, we go to appreciate,
but we also feel much pain.
Every brick, every carved beam,
every stroke, whether thick or thin,
all involve the network of people's nerves.
Every year there are many days of remembrance,
following the meridians of the earth,
difficultly spreading...
Behind that smooth surface,
history is layered and sedimented,
whether it is dross or crystal,
it is equally thick and heavy.
Thus,
I saw a horizon,
head connected to head,
in the Eastern world,
welcoming the rise of the sun god.

　　中国名胜
    鄂青子
    被印成各种贺年片
    带着仰慕　带着敬意
    带着情感和爱
    在节日的氛围翩翩而飞
    可以说　那上面的色彩
    无处不凝聚着中华祖先的血汗
    我们去读我们去欣赏
    我们也多痛苦
    每一块砖　每一根雕梁
    每一笔或粗或细的线条
    都牵涉着人们网状的神经
    每一年就有很多回忆的日子
    顺着大地的经脉
    艰难地蔓延……
    在那光洁的画面之后
    历史一层一层地淤积
    无论浮渣还是结晶
    一样浑厚而沉重
    于是
    我看清了一道地平线
    头颅与头颅连接着
    在东方世界
    迎候太阳之神的升腾
