	Audio Letters
	Recently, the Dutch postal service has issued a type of audio letter that is highly popular. The principle and method are extremely simple, the procedure is very convenient, and the price is quite affordable.

	This type of letter involves using the familiar blank cassette tapes sold at post offices. The "sender" can purchase a tape to record ten minutes of conversation. After recording, the sender buys a sturdy special envelope, seals it, affixes the postage, and can send it to any part of the world. The Dutch postal service provides a complete set of services for those who wish to use audio letters, and the fee is only two dollars.

	Upon receiving the letter, the recipient can use a tape recorder to listen repeatedly, truly feeling as if they are hearing the sender's voice, which is quite intimate.

	This new postal service has become a nationwide trend in the Netherlands. Influenced by this, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Hong Kong, and other countries and regions have also started to popularize these highly welcomed audio letters.

　　有声信件
    近来，荷兰邮政局发行了一种大受欢迎的有声信件。原理、方式都极其简单、手续也十分方便，价格还相当便宜。
    这种信件就是把人们司空见惯的空白盒式录音带放在邮局出售，“发信人”可购一盒录十分钟的谈话。录好之后，寄信人再购一个结实的专用信封封好，贴足邮票，可以寄往世界各地。荷兰邮局为愿用有声信件者提供专门的一整套服务，收费也只二美元。
    收信人收到信后，可用收录放机反复聆听，真是闻声如见其人，备觉亲切。
    这一邮政新业务在荷兰已风行全国。受它的影响，现在丹麦、瑞典、挪威、香港等国家和地区也盛行起这大受欢迎的有声信件来。
