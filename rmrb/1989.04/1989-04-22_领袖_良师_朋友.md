Leader, Mentor, Friend

On April 19, the China Youth Daily published a long article by Zhang Liqun commemorating Comrade Hu Yaobang. Here is an excerpt:

On March 26, 1989, Comrade Hu Yaobang spoke with me and several other retired cadres in the living room of his home. He said, "I am reading 'Zhou Enlai Biography.' Premier Zhou said, 'Whoever grasps the youth, grasps the future.'" He raised his left hand and extended his right palm, emotionally saying, "We must insist on taking the correct attitude towards the youth. Adolescents are in the process of growth; they are growing in motion, full of vigor and energy!" As he spoke, he raised two fists, mimicking the horns on a bull's head, thrusting left and right: "Look, as soon as the children come on stage, they take a fighting stance, bravely moving forward! As for the old man, he spreads his hands and stretches his legs, lying down!" Humorous words revealed a childlike heart.

His cheerful expression suddenly turned serious. He said, "Among the 220 million illiterates, there are many young people. Children do not read or write, they drop out of school to set up stalls. My secretary who went to Shandong with me told me that he asked a 13-year-old student why he did not go to school, and the child replied frankly: 'I make more money doing this business than a teacher does!'"

Comrade Hu Yaobang became even more serious: "Earning money without knowledge, loving money more than letters. Where does this idea come from? 'Actions speak louder than words'—teachers earn little money, isn't this 'taught' by the teachers? I am just joking. Students dislike learning, it's not the fault of the young, the responsibility lies with the elders!"

Comrade Chen Yi interjected, "Yaobang, we have been doing revolution for decades, giving everything to the Party. Now there are so many things to do for the country's construction, how can we rest easy?"

I immediately added, "Comrade Hu Yaobang, do you remember? In 1973, when I was released from prison and came to Beijing, I poured out my heart to you, reflecting my concerns for the country. You said: You must believe that the country built by Chairman Mao and the communists will be managed well and will not be ruined by itself! How could one ruin the cause one has created?"

Comrade Hu Yaobang looked at Chen Yi and then at me, and smiled, a smile so pure! I felt that the person standing in front of me was Hu Yaobang from the 1950s, the Hu Yaobang who served as the first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League with millions of members, the Hu Yaobang who was full of vigor and vitality in his prime!

Click, the flash went off, and the hidden Xinhua News Agency reporter, Zhu Yunwen, suddenly took a photo. Comrade Hu Yaobang waved his hand amicably, "Come, let's take a photo." The small reception room of about 18 square meters became even more lively. It was truly intimate and harmonious. Leader, mentor, friend, comrade, how can one distinguish them? (Photo attached)

### 领袖·良师·朋友

专栏：

　　领袖·良师·朋友
    ４月１９日《中国青年报》发表张黎群撰写的怀念胡耀邦同志长文，这里摘录其中一段：
    １９８９年３月２６日，胡耀邦同志在他家的客厅里同我和其他几个离休干部谈心。他说：“我在读《周恩来传》。总理讲，谁掌握青年，谁就掌握未来。”他举起左手，伸出右掌，动情地说：“我们必须坚持对青年采取正确的态度。青少年处于成长的过程中，他们是在动态中成长，血气方刚，天性好动！”说着说着举起两个拳头，模拟牛头上长的两只角左挑右突：“你看，少年儿童一出台就摆出一副战斗架势，勇敢向前！老头子么，双手一摊、腿一伸，躺下了！”幽默的语言中透出一颗赤子之心。
    紧接着，他快活的面容一下变得沉重起来，他说：“二亿二千万文盲中，青少年多的是。小孩不读书识字，弃学摆生意摊摊。随我去山东的秘书告诉我，他问一名１３岁的小学生为什么不读书，这孩子回答得干脆利落：俺干这个买卖比老师挣的钱多！”
    胡耀邦同志说到这里，更加严肃起来：“不挣学问只挣钱，不爱识字喜钞票。这个思想从哪里来的？‘身教重于言教’——老师挣钱少，这岂不是由老师‘身教’来的？我这是笑话一句。学生厌学，非年轻人之过，责任在长辈呵！”
    陈沂同志插话了：“耀邦呵，我们这些人干了几十年革命，一身精光，全都奉献给党了。现在国家建设的事这么多，我们哪能高枕无忧呢？”
    我紧接着说：“耀邦同志还记得不？１９７３年我出狱来京，向你倾吐真心话，反映自己忧国心情。你对我说：一定要相信毛主席和共产党人打出来的江山会治理好的，不会自己搞垮的！哪能自己搞垮自己创建起来的事业呢？”
    耀邦同志看看陈沂，又看看我，笑了，笑得多么纯真！我觉着站在面前的是５０年代的胡耀邦，是那位担任拥有千百万共青团员的团中央第一书记的胡耀邦，是生气勃勃生龙活虎正值盛年的胡耀邦！
    咔嚓，闪光灯一亮，隐藏新华社记者身份的朱允文冷不防拍了一张照，耀邦同志慈祥随和地招手，“来吧，我们照像。”约１８平方米的小会客室更加活跃起来了。真个是亲密无间，其乐融融。领袖、良师、朋友、同志，怎么区别得开呢？（附图片）
