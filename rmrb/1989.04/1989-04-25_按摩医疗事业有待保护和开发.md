Currently, China has over 500 massage hospitals (clinics), with more than 10,000 massage doctors, of which over 7,100 are blind. These individuals have some who have been practicing massage therapy for over 30 years, possessing exceptional skills; others have innovated techniques and written books.

According to statistics from the Beijing Massage Hospital for the first half of 1988, during its 30 years of operation, the hospital has treated 4 million patients. Many of the treated cases have shown an effectiveness rate of over 96%. Some patients came in with pain and left with laughter and healthy steps. A child patient, Li Zhaolei, from Yanji City, Jilin Province, had stiff limbs and was unable to crawl at the age of four, diagnosed with cerebral palsy. After four months of massage treatment at the Beijing Massage Hospital, the child not only could stand and squat but also walk. A patient with chest pain was treated for coronary heart disease in another hospital for three months with no effect. A blind massage doctor, after palpation, found that the fifth thoracic vertebra was misaligned. After manipulation, the pain disappeared.

Massage therapy, which does not require surgery or injections, and avoids the harm of chemical drugs, is gaining increasing attention worldwide. In Japanese cities, "massage hospitals" are commonly seen; in the United States, with a population of only 200 million, there were 14 massage specialty universities in the 1970s, and over 20,000 massage professionals had received higher education. In contrast, China currently has only four blind massage vocational schools in Shanxi, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, and Henan. With a population of 1.1 billion, China has only half the number of massage doctors as the United States in the 1970s. Moreover, research on massage techniques and therapeutic mechanisms using modern science is still a blank. China's traditional medical discipline—massage—has lost its advantage.

Currently, there is a misconception in society that massage is merely a profession provided by the civil affairs department to help blind people find employment and should not be considered part of the medical industry. This misconception is one of the obstacles to the development of massage therapy. Currently, blind doctors with high medical skills do not receive professional titles, while non-blind doctors they train do. In many places, the welfare and treatment of massage doctors are also lower than those of other doctors.

There is a call now: to recognize massage therapy as part of the overall medical industry, to establish more massage specialty schools, to train more massage professionals, and to improve their quality. At the same time, to strengthen the theoretical research of massage medicine and to push China's traditional medicine to a new stage.

### 按摩医疗事业有待保护和开发

　　按摩医疗事业有待保护和开发
    目前，我国有５００多所按摩医院（诊所），按摩医生１万余人，其中７１００多名是盲人。这些人有的已从事按摩医疗３０多年，身怀绝技；有的创新技术，著书立说。
    据北京按摩医院１９８８年上半年统计，建院３０周年中，共收治患者４００万人次，其中许多病科有效率为９６％以上。有的患者痛苦呻吟搀扶而来，欢声笑语健步而去。吉林省延吉市患儿李兆磊四肢僵直，４岁尚不会爬行，被确诊为脑瘫。经北京按摩医院４个月按摩治疗，不仅能够站立、下蹲，而且可以行走。有位胸痛病人曾在别的医院被作为冠心病治疗３个月，毫无效果。盲人按摩医生经过摸诊，发现病人第５胸椎错位，经推拉复位，疼痛随之消失。
    一不用手术开刀，二不用打针吃药，无需担心受到化学药物侵害的按摩医疗，越来越受到世界各国的重视。在日本城镇，经常可见“按摩医院”的招牌；仅有２亿多人口的美国，７０年代即有１４所按摩专科大学，当时受到高等教育的按摩医务人员已达２万余人。而我国目前只有山西、陕西、江西、河南４所盲人按摩中等专业学校；１１亿人口的我国，按摩医生仅有美国７０年代的一半。而且，对按摩手法及治疗机理应用现代科学进行研究尚属空白。我国的传统医疗学科——按摩，已经失去优势。
    现在，社会上有人认为，按摩只是民政部门为安置盲人就业提供的一种职业，不应算作医疗事业的一部分。这种认识，是阻碍按摩医疗发展的一个原因。现在医术上很有造诣的盲人医生的职称得不到承认，他们培养出来的非盲人医生，却获得了专业职称。在不少地方，按摩医生的福利待遇也低于其他医生。
    当前有这样的呼声：要从认识上将按摩医疗确认为整个医疗事业的一部分，创办更多的按摩专业学校，培养更多的按摩医务人员，提高他们的素质。同时要加强按摩医学的理论研究，将我国的传统医学推向新的阶段。
