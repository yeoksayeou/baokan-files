Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, April 16th.

The chairman of the West German Olympic Committee, Willi Daume, recently stated that it is "quite possible" for West Germany to host the Olympic Games, and that they are retaining the right to apply.

According to the DPA, the prospects for holding the 2000 Olympic Games in West Germany are improving. Cities such as West Berlin, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Stuttgart, and the Ruhr area are all hoping to host the Games. To this end, the National Olympic Committee will invite representatives from these cities to meet in Munich on July 7th to discuss the matter. If West Berlin is a viable option, the other cities will step aside.

In an effort to secure the right to host the Olympic Games, the West German sports community is also taking other steps. The German Sports Federation and the National Olympic Committee have decided to establish a joint committee to combat the use of performance-enhancing drugs, replacing the separate organizations that each had previously.

　　联邦德国争办２０００年奥运会
    新华社波恩４月１6日电　联邦德国奥委会主席维利·道默最近说，联邦德国举办奥运会“是十分可能的，我们保留着申请权”。
    据德新社报道，２０００年在联邦德国举行奥运会的前景上升。西柏林、法兰克福、汉堡、斯图加特和鲁尔区的一些城市都希望承办奥运会。为此，国家奥委会将在今年７月７日邀请这些城市的代表在慕尼黑协商，如西柏林有可能承办，其他城市将让路。
    为争取举办奥运会，联邦德国体育界还在其它方面创造条件。联邦德国体协和国家奥委会已决定成立共同的反对运动员服用兴奋剂委员会，代替双方各自的有关组织。
