Title: Stones Sold as Coal—Strange Occurrences in the Coal Market of Southern Jiangsu

Recently, a reporter visited the Southern Jiangsu region and found that many enterprises, after purchasing high-priced, low-quality coal, were unable to burn it, leading to widespread complaints.

Since the second half of last year, the cities of Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Changzhou in Jiangsu Province have been severely short of coal. Certain coal supply units and lawless elements, taking advantage of the desperate need for coal, have organized large quantities of low-quality coal from other regions to Southern Jiangsu, passing off inferior coal as high-quality.

On the ancient canal in Changzhou, the reporter saw coal-carrying barges and wooden boats packed into the harbor. Each boat carried between 10 tons to over 100 tons of coal, forming a vast, black expanse. At first glance, the coal appeared to be of good quality, but upon closer inspection, it was evident that a significant amount of gangue and dust, as well as soil, had been mixed in.

Informed sources told the reporter that most of the coal came from Xuzhou and Zaozhuang, with some also sourced from Sichuan, Hubei, and Lianghuai. Certain individuals would purchase a small amount of good coal from mines and then mix in a large quantity of gangue. If the gangue was too large and easily noticeable, they would use a crusher to pulverize it. Currently, in the Xuzhou Copper Mountain area, there are even "specialized coal gangue producers" who are constantly mining the mountains. Once-neglected gangue hills have become the "gold mines" of these specialized producers.

The Dongfang Dyeing Factory in Changzhou purchased this type of coal, but it would not burn, so they had to use diesel and wood to assist in combustion. A 3,000-kilowatt steam-powered generator required over 20 cubic meters of wood to burn over 10 days. The factory director and the boiler workers were sweating profusely in front of the furnace, but the flames remained weak, and the steam was insufficient.

The production of chemical fertilizer factories in Wuxi, Changzhou, and Wujin has been severely affected, leading to increased costs and reduced product quality. It is no wonder that in this region, the following humorous poem has been circulating: "Coal prices are high, but the coal bought cannot be burned. Stones are sold as coal, and speculators have new tricks."

### 石头当煤卖——苏南煤炭市场咄咄怪事

　　石头当煤卖
    ——苏南煤炭市场咄咄怪事
    最近，记者来到苏南地区，看到不少企业用高价购进的劣质煤无法燃烧，纷纷叫苦。
    从去年下半年开始，江苏镇江、无锡、苏州、常州一带缺煤严重。某些供煤单位和不法分子利用用户求煤心切，从外地组织大量低质煤运到苏南，以劣充优。
    在常州古运河上，记者看到运煤的驳船、木船挤满港口。一条船少则装载１０吨，多则上百吨，黑压压一片。表面看是好煤，稍一翻动，就可发现其中掺了大量的矸石和灰粉、泥土。
    知情人士告诉记者，这些煤炭大部分是从徐州、枣庄一带弄来的，也有从四川、湖北、两淮弄来的。某些人从煤矿上买进一部分好煤然后掺进大量矸石，有的占一半以上。矸石太大，容易露眼，他们就用粉碎机把它粉碎。现在，在徐州铜山一带，竟出现了“煤矸石专业户”，每天挖山不止。一向无人问津的矸石山，成了这些“专业户”的“金山”。
    常州东方印染厂购进这种煤，烧不着，只好借助柴油、木头助燃。一台３０００千瓦的发电蒸汽机，１０多天烧木头２０多立方米。厂长和司炉工人在炉前累得满头大汗，依然火苗不旺，蒸汽不足。
    无锡、常州、武进等化肥厂的生产受到严重影响，成本提高，产品质量下降。难怪在这一带流传着这样一首打油诗：煤炭价格高，买回不好烧，石头当煤卖，“倒爷”出新招。
