To fight for women's equal rights, hundreds of thousands march in the U.S.

New China News Agency, Washington, April 9 (Reporter: Lù Wényuè) Hundreds of thousands of people from all over the United States gathered on the lawn in front of the White House this morning for an unprecedented rally to fight for women's equal rights in American history.

Under the leadership of national women's organizations, hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children who support the right to abortion held a two-hour rally. At noon, a marching army led by American civil rights leader Jesse Jackson and 30 members of Congress, as well as 25 Hollywood actresses, began to march majestically along Constitution Avenue towards the Capitol.

The march lasted for three hours. According to the police, the number of people participating in the rally and march reached 300,000. However, according to Molly Yard, chairwoman of the National Organization for Women, the number of marchers was as high as 600,000, making it the largest and most powerful rally of its kind. In the afternoon, the marchers gathered again in the square in front of the Capitol for a two-hour rally.

At both rallies, Ms. Yard and Reverend Jackson, along with dozens of politicians, social activists, professors, and celebrities from the arts world, delivered speeches. They strongly condemned the Reagan and Bush administrations' attempts to strip women of their abortion rights and urged the Supreme Court to respect women's right to choose freely and uphold the 1973 decision that women have the right to choose abortion.

The U.S. Supreme Court first passed a resolution in 1973 that women have the right to choose abortion. However, during Reagan's presidency, the anti-abortion conservatives gradually gained the majority in the Supreme Court. Currently, out of the nine justices, six are believed to be opposed to abortion laws. On April 26, the Supreme Court will reconvene to hear the abortion issue. People are concerned that this hearing may lead to the Supreme Court overturning the historic 1973 decision, causing American women to lose their abortion rights again. Today's rally and march took place against this backdrop.

### 为争取妇女平等权利　美数十万人游行

　　为争取妇女平等权利
　　美数十万人游行
    新华社华盛顿４月９日电　（记者陆文岳）来自美国各地的数十万人今天上午在白宫前的草坪上，举行了美国历史上规模空前的争取妇女平等权利的盛大集会。
    在全国妇女组织的领导下，数十万支持堕胎权的男女老少首先举行了两小时的集会。中午１２时，以美国民权运动领袖杰西·杰克逊和３０位国会议员以及２５位好莱坞女明星为先导的游行大军，开始浩浩荡荡地沿着宪法大道向国会山前进。
    游行活动整整持续了３小时。据警方估计，参加集会和游行的人数达３０万，但据全国妇女组织主席莫莉·亚德宣称，游行人数多达６０万，其规模与声势之大是前所未有的。下午，游行群众在国会山前的广场上再次举行了长达两小时的集会。
    在两次集会上，亚德女士和杰克逊牧师等数十位政治家、社会活动家、教授和文艺界名流相继发表演说，严厉谴责里根政府和布什政府企图剥夺妇女的堕胎权利，呼吁最高法院尊重妇女的自由选择权利，维护１９７３年作出的妇女有权选择堕胎的裁决。
    美国最高法院曾于１９７３年首次通过了妇女有权选择堕胎的决议。但是在里根执政期间，反对堕胎的保守派逐渐在最高法院占多数。目前在９名最高法官中，有６名被认为对堕胎法持反对意见。４月２６日，最高法院将重新就堕胎问题举行听证会。人们担心，这次听证会可能导致最高法院推翻１９７３年的历史性裁决，使美国妇女再次丧失堕胎权利。今天的集会游行即是在这样的背景下发生的。（附图片）
