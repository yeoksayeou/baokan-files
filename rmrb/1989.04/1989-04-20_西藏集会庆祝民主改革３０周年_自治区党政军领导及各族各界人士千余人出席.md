Today in the afternoon, over a thousand people from various ethnic groups and sectors of society gathered at the Lhasa Theater to celebrate the 30th anniversary of democratic reforms in Tibet. Hu Jintao, Secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region Party Committee, delivered a lengthy speech titled "Carry Forward the Past, Unite and Struggle, Revitalize Tibet." National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Vice Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Tibet People's Congress, Pabala Gelegdainqie, as well as representatives from the military, intellectuals, and citizens, also gave passionate speeches.

The meeting began with a moment of silence proposed by the Chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region People's Government, Duoji Cairang, to honor the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for Tibet's revolution and construction, and to commemorate Hu Yaobang, who passed away on the 15th. The entire audience stood in silence for three minutes, and some people shed tears.

In his speech, Hu Jintao elaborated on the historical significance of Tibet's democratic reforms. He described the reforms as "a profound revolution in Tibet's social development," an integral part of the Chinese Communist Party-led New Democratic Revolution in China. The primary goal was to overthrow the feudal serf-owning class's rule in Tibet, transforming feudal serf-owning into individual ownership by farmers and herdsmen, and turning feudal serf Tibet into a democratic Tibet.

He stated that the formal establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region in 1965 marked the beginning of Tibetans enjoying the rights of regional autonomy granted by the constitution.

The democratic reforms abolished the feudal serf-owning system, transforming production relations and liberating social productivity. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Party has implemented a series of special policies and flexible measures in Tibet, promoting rapid economic development and progress in ethnic culture and society.

Hu Jintao mentioned in his speech that due to Tibet's weak economic foundation, late start and low starting point in revolution and construction, as well as the impact of the ten-year turmoil and mistakes in our work, the level of productive forces in our region is still low, the commodity economy is underdeveloped, cultural and educational undertakings are backward, and the people's lives are not yet prosperous. The task of developing economic and cultural construction is arduous; on the other hand, domestic and foreign separatist forces are still plotting and inciting activities to split the motherland, the situation of anti-separatist struggle is severe, and the task of stabilizing the situation is heavy. There are still many problems and difficulties that need to be urgently solved on Tibet's path forward.

Hu Jintao said, "In the coming period, the general guiding ideology for Tibet's work is to grasp economic construction and reform and opening up with one hand, and to grasp the stabilization of the situation and the anti-separatist struggle with the other hand."

In his speech, Hu Jintao expressed concern for Tibetans living abroad, hoping that they would contribute their efforts to maintaining national unity and the prosperity of their homeland and ethnic group.

Pabala Gelegdainqie also spoke at the meeting.

Leaders from the Party, government, and military of the Tibet Autonomous Region attended the gathering. Staff from the Nepal Consulate General in Lhasa and over 20 foreign experts and scholars working in Lhasa were invited to attend the meeting.

　　西藏集会庆祝民主改革３０周年    
    自治区党政军领导及各族各界人士千余人出席
    本报拉萨４月２０日电  记者卢小飞、刘伟报道：今天下午，西藏千余名各族各界人士在拉萨剧院隆重集会，庆祝西藏实行民主改革３０周年。自治区党委书记胡锦涛在会上作了题为《继往开来，团结奋斗，振兴西藏》的长篇报告。全国政协副主席、西藏人大常委会副主任帕巴拉·格列朗杰以及解放军、知识分子和市民代表也发表了热情洋溢的讲话。
    会议开始后，自治区人民政府主席多吉才让提议向为西藏革命和建设捐躯的先烈和向１５日逝世的胡耀邦同志默哀，全场肃静了３分钟，人群中有人流下了眼泪。
    胡锦涛在报告中阐述了西藏民主改革的历史意义。他称民主改革是“西藏社会发展史上的一场深刻革命”，是中国共产党领导的中国新民主主义革命的一个组成部分。其主要任务是推翻封建农奴主阶级在西藏的统治，变封建农奴主所有制为农牧民个体所有制，变封建农奴制的西藏为人民民主的西藏。
    他说，１９６５年西藏自治区的正式成立，标志着西藏人民享有了宪法赋予的民族区域自治的权利。
    民主改革废除了封建农奴主所有制，实现了生产关系的变革，解放了社会生产力，特别是十一届三中全会以来，党在西藏实行一系列特殊政策和灵活措施，促进了西藏经济的迅速发展和民族文化和社会的进步。
    胡锦涛在讲话中说，由于西藏过去经济基础差，革命和建设起步晚、起点低，加上十年动乱的影响和我们工作中的失误，我区的生产力发展水平还很低，商品经济不发达，文化教育事业落后，人民生活还不富裕，发展经济文化建设的任务十分艰巨；另一方面，国内外分裂势力仍在策划、煽动分裂祖国的活动，反分裂斗争形势严峻，稳定局势任务很重。西藏前进的道路上还有许多亟待解决的问题和困难。
    胡锦涛说：“坚持一手抓经济建设，改革开放，一手抓稳定局势和反分裂斗争，是今后一个时期西藏工作总的指导思想。”
    胡锦涛在讲话中对流落异国的藏胞表示关注，他殷切希望国外藏胞为维护祖国统一，为故乡繁荣、民族昌盛贡献自己的一份力量。
    帕巴拉·格列朗杰也在会上讲了话。
    西藏自治区党、政、军负责人参加了集会，尼泊尔驻拉萨总领事馆的工作人员和在拉萨工作的２０余名外国专家、学者应邀参加了集会。
