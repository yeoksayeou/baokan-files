	Strengthening the Management of Dual-Use Talent Certificates

	Last year, our county received 140 demobilized soldiers, most of whom have expertise in automobile driving, electrical repair, agricultural machinery repair, planting, and some even have a certain level of news writing ability. After these soldiers returned to civilian life, some became technical backbones in factories and mines, while others were recruited by villages as cadres. In the process of settling demobilized soldiers, we also discovered some thought-provoking issues. Some units focus only on the quantity of dual-use talent certificates, neglecting the quality of talent cultivation. A demobilized soldier from the Shenyang Military Region said that their unit held two talent training classes, which were hastily concluded in just two or three days. Almost all veterans who had served for more than three years received a red certificate. A soldier demobilized from the Jinan Military Region presented certificates in automobile driving, accounting, and news reporting when he reported for duty, requesting a recommendation to a suitable unit in the county. Upon investigation, it was found that his three certificates were all obtained through connections.

	I believe that the issuance of military-civilian dual-use talent certificates should reflect the true level of each soldier. This is not only a responsibility to the soldiers but also to the local areas and the employing units. Therefore, the military should strengthen the leadership of talent cultivation and the management of certificate issuance.

### 加强对两用人才证书的发放管理

　　加强对两用人才证书的发放管理
    去年我县接收的１４０名退伍军人，大都具有汽车驾驶、电器维修、农机修理、种植等专长，有的还具有一定的新闻写作能力，这些战士到地方后，有的成了厂矿的技术骨干，有的被乡村录用为干部。在安置复员退伍军人的工作中，我们也发现了一些令人深思的问题。有的部队培养军队、地方两用人才只注重两用人才证书的数量，忽视育才的质量。沈阳军区一退伍战士说，他们部队举办的两个育才班，两三天就草率收兵，在部队３年以上的老战士几乎都领到了一个红本本。一个从济南军区退伍的战士报到时拿出汽车驾驶、财会专业、新闻报道证书，要求推荐到县里合适的单位工作。经了解，他的３张证书都是搞关系捞到的。
    我认为，军地两用人才证书的发放，应代表每个战士的真实水平，这不但是对战士负责，也是对地方和用人单位负责。因此，部队应加强对育才工作的领导，加强对证书的发放管理。
