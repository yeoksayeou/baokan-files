The decision by the Communist Youth League Central Committee stipulates that starting from May 4, 1989, the commendation for league members will be uniformly referred to as the "Excellent Communist Youth League Member" title. The "Excellent Communist Youth League Member" title will be conferred by the Central, Provincial, Municipal (District), County Committees of the League, and grassroots committees, with the "Excellent Communist Youth League Member Honor Mark" divided into five levels accordingly. When the League organization conducts commendations for league members, it should make a commendation decision for the commended league members, confer the honorary title, issue the honor mark, and paste the honor mark in the "League Member Awards" column of the league member's certificate.
