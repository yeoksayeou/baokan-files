Federal investigators' preliminary findings indicate that in the "Exxon Valdez" oil tanker grounding and oil spill accident, Captain Joseph Hazelwood was drunk and neglected his duties, bearing irrefutable responsibility. Exxon Shipping Company today announced the dismissal of Hazelwood, and a Coast Guard spokesman said that Hazelwood's captain's license would be suspended or revoked based on the facts.

Hazelwood was not checked until about 10 hours after the accident, and his blood alcohol content was still as high as 0.061, while the maximum allowed is 0.04. At the time of the accident, he was not in the pilot house, and an unqualified third mate was in charge, causing the tanker to hit a clearly marked reef. It is expected that Hazelwood will be handed over to the court for trial.

Currently, the oil slick in Prince William Sound covers an area of more than 1,300 square kilometers. Exxon has deployed 12 oil skimming devices to collect floating oil and has set up more than 20 kilometers of oil containment and skimming booms. Beach and rock cleaning work will also begin. The Navy will assist in the oil skimming operations. It is estimated that the ecological environment around this area will take 10 years to fully recover.

　　美调查“瓦尔德兹”号触礁事故
    船长玩忽职守被开除
    本报华盛顿３月３０日电  记者仓立德报道：联邦调查人员的初步调查结果表明，在“瓦尔德兹”号油轮触礁漏油事故中，船长里泽伍德饮酒过度、玩忽职守，负有不可推卸的责任。埃克森船运公司今天宣布开除里泽伍德，海岸警卫队发言人表示将根据事实中止或吊销里泽伍德的船长执照。
    里泽伍德在事故发生后约１０小时才受到检查，结果他的血液酒精含量仍高达０．０６１，而最高允许含量为０．０４。事故发生时他不在驾驶室，而由不够资格的三副代行操纵，致使油轮撞在标志非常明显的礁石上。预料里泽伍德将被送交法庭审判。
    目前，威廉太子湾海域的油层覆盖面积已达１３００多平方公里。埃克森公司已出动１２具吸油装置收集浮油，并敷设了２０多公里长的防油、吸油围栏，清洗海滩、岩石工作也将开始。海军将协助吸油工作。据估计，这片海域周围的生态环境１０年后才能完全恢复。
