Title: Competitors, Organizers, and Spectators

In February, Haikou hosted the International Marathon Race.

There were hundreds of competitors, thousands of organizers, and tens of thousands of spectators.

I was among the spectators. I watched the starting ceremony but did not see those athletes who reached the finish line last. After the awards were given out, I left. Most spectators did the same. Only the referees, scorers, medical staff, and those directly responsible for organizing the event stayed until the end.

The spectators gave a warm round of applause to the first athlete to reach the finish line. Flashbulbs went off in layers, and reporters and autograph seekers surrounded the first-place winner, Zhang Guowei, who was overwhelmed. The second and third place finishers also received enthusiastic welcomes. The further back the finishers were, the sparser the applause. It's hard to say that the last finishers were snubbed, because by then, everyone had left, each going about their own business, possibly forgetting about them altogether.

Running 42.195 kilometers requires not only a strong physique but also perseverance. Crossing oceans to participate in the race requires a firm resolve. I believe that whether it's the athletes at the front, those who finished last, or those who dropped out midway, their spirit, determination, and perseverance all deserve encouragement and respect.

The organizers of this event also had a tough job. They had to raise funds, arrange transportation, accommodation, choose the route, and ensure safety and medical support. They spent four months preparing for this. It is said that generally, half a year of preparation is needed.

Being a spectator is the easiest role.

From this competition, I felt that mutual understanding and support among competitors, organizers, and spectators are incredibly important. If the competitors do not communicate well with the organizers and understand each other, it will be difficult for them to complete the entire course. If the organizers do not gain the respect and obedience of the competitors, the competition will be difficult to proceed smoothly. However, having only competitors and organizers without the support and approval of the many spectators will make the event cold and unsuccessful.

Opening up, reforming, and establishing special economic zones are somewhat similar to hosting this international marathon race.

When the economic special zones were first established, there were many criticisms, especially when encountering difficulties, there were many criticisms and more discussions. Now, when establishing large special zones, and within these zones, establishing development zones, whether it is an old problem or a new thing, there might not be as many criticisms, but there will still be some cold water poured on the efforts.

Among the spectators, the majority are cheering, encouraging, and motivating the long-distance runners to reach the finish line. However, there are also a few who stand by with cold eyes, making comments and mocking, waiting to see you fail and make a fool of yourself.

Establishing a large special zone in Hainan, as everyone often says, has a high target, a low starting point, many contradictions, and great difficulties. It is somewhat like a triathlon, where you first swim 2,000 meters, then run 42.195 kilometers, and finally cycle 80 kilometers. As participants in this activity, of course, you need to have a certain amount of physical strength, perseverance, and confidence; otherwise, you would not participate. In the process, it is inevitable that there will be some who drop out midway, get injured and stop, or collapse from exhaustion. However, most athletes can reach the finish line, regardless of whether the time is long or short.

Spectators, of course, are the most relaxed. They do not need to struggle and do not need to worry. But since they are spectators, they have the responsibility to help the competition proceed smoothly. At least during the time they are watching, they should maintain order, clap and cheer, and encourage the athletes to continue moving forward, rather than booing or setting obstacles.

Reflecting on this, I think of reform, opening up, and establishing large special zones, which also have participants, organizers, and spectators. If everyone can put themselves in the others' shoes, understand each other, support each other, and communicate heart to heart, it would be invaluable for the cause of reform, opening up, and establishing large special zones.

　　竞赛者·组织者·旁观者
　　许士杰
    ２月间，海口举行了国际马拉松赛。
    竞赛者以百计，组织者以千计，旁观者以万计。
    我属于旁观者，看了起跑式，没有看到那些最后到达终点的运动员，发完奖后就走了。旁观者绝大部分是如此的，只有裁判员、记分员、医护人员，以及直接负责这场活动的组织者，坚持到最后。
    旁观者对第一个到达终点的优胜者，报以热烈的掌声，闪光灯围成几层，访问的，要求签名的，使第一名张国伟应接不暇。第二名、第三名，也受到热烈的欢迎。越往后就越稀疏了。对最后到达者很难说是给予冷遇，因为大家都回去了，各干各的事，可能把他们都给忘了。
    跑完４２．１９５公里，对竞赛者来说，没有强健的体力不行，没有毅力也不行。飘洋过海来参赛，没有坚定的决心更不行。我以为，不管对那些跑在前列的，最后到达的，半途落荒的，他们的精神、决心与毅力，都应该得到鼓励与尊敬。
    这场活动的组织者，也不是轻松的，要筹集资金、安排交通、食宿、选择线路、做好安全与救护，他们用了四个月的时间作准备。据说，一般需要半年准备。
    当旁观者是最容易的。
    从这次比赛，我感到竞赛者、组织者、旁观者之间互相了解、互相支持是多么重要。竞赛者如果没有和组织者很好的沟通、了解，很难取得跑完全程的成绩；组织者没有取得竞赛者的尊重与服从指挥，比赛也难于顺利进行；而光有竞赛者与组织者，没有众多的旁观者的赞许与支持，既冷冷清清，也办不好。
    开放、改革，办大特区，有点类似这次举行的国际马拉松赛。
    当年办经济特区的时候，指摘颇多，尤其是碰到困难时，帽子不少，议论更多。现在办大特区，在大特区中又办开发区，说是老问题也好，新事物也好，棍子大概不会有，帽子却不能保证没有，被泼点冷水更难于避免。
    旁观队伍中，多数人是在鼓掌，在助威，在激励长跑者拚搏到达终点，也确有少数袖手冷眼旁观者在议论，在嘲笑，用挑剔的眼光等着看你落荒而逃闹笑话。
    海南办大特区，正如大家常说的，目标高，起点低，矛盾多，困难大，有点类似铁人三项赛，即先游泳２０００米，在跑完４２．１９５公里之后，接着再骑单车走８０公里。作为参加这个活动的运动员来说，当然要有一定的体力、毅力与信心，不然，就不会参赛。这中间，难免有半途落荒的，受伤却步的，体力不支昏倒的，但，大多数运动员是可以跑到终点的，不管时间长与短。
    旁观者当然就是最轻松的，既不用拚搏，又不必费心。但，既然作为观众，就有责任帮助竞赛顺利举行，至少在你旁观时所站那一段路要共同维护秩序，鼓掌助威，激励运动员继续前进，而不要喝倒彩，设障碍。
    浮想联翩，由此及彼，于是想到，改革，开放，办大特区，也有参赛者，组织者，旁观者。大家如能设身处地，互相谅解，互相支持，心心相通，对于改革、开放，办大特区的事业，多么珍贵。
