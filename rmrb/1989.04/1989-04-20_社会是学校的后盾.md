Society is the Backbone of Schools

By XU BAOKANG, People's Daily Reporter

Visiting various parts of North Korea, one finds that everyone considers education to be a more important project than building tall buildings. Over the 40-plus years since the founding of the republic, schools have trained more than 1.2 million intellectuals for society. Currently, more than 20% of the workforce in various sectors of the North Korean economy are technical personnel and experts, who have become the backbone of economic development. Schools have provided a large number of talents to society, but how does society promote the development of education?

The Workers' Party of Korea and the government have always believed that "society should be the backbone of schools" and have taken corresponding measures. The government stipulates that supporting schools is an unavoidable responsibility of society, and that parents supporting schools is a noble virtue. The government has launched a continuous campaign nationwide to "support schools with society." The Cabinet and local governments have arranged "supporting" units (supporting organizations) for all levels of schools across the country. These supporting units range from national agencies to factories and units around schools. The supporting units for colleges and universities are directly arranged by the Cabinet, while the supporting units for middle and primary schools nationwide are specifically arranged by local governments.

The state stipulates that all units designated as school supporting units must include supporting schools in their important work agendas. The main content of society supporting schools is to repair school buildings, add equipment, improve the environment, and visit teachers, etc. The funds for supporting schools by school supporting units are partly allocated by the state, but most of them are raised by the supporting units through increased production, savings, and recycling. The results of supporting schools by supporting units are regularly checked and summarized by higher authorities, with praise and criticism given.

Recently, the reporter visited the Pyongyang Pyongchun Boys' High School. This school has two supporting units: the 3.21 Factory and the Ministry of Maritime Transport. Over the years, these two supporting units have done a lot for the school. The 3.21 Factory provided the school with a set of indoor comprehensive driving training platforms for 20 students to learn driving skills. The Ministry of Maritime Transport, to improve the quality of school education and the learning environment, donated video machines, projectors, plastic floors, high-quality wallpaper, etc. to the school, and built a swimming pool and updated old desks and chairs for the school. On every holiday, the two supporting units, led by the party secretaries, visit the school to comfort the teachers and students. It is coincidental that on this day, the administrative director of the Maritime Transport Department, Han Dongje, was there discussing the arrangements for the Maritime Transport Department's support for the school this year with the school. The female principal, Han Boksun, excitedly told the reporter, "These supporting units not only bring us a batch of materials, but more importantly, they bring us a heartfelt concern, making us feel the warmth and encouragement of society."

Today, the "society supports schools" campaign in North Korea has been institutionalized. Millions of school supporting units are adding bricks and tiles to education, striving for greater heights.

　　社会是学校的后盾
    本报记者  徐宝康
    走访朝鲜各地，一提起教育人人都认为这是一项比建设高楼大厦更重要的工程。共和国成立４０多年来，学校已为社会培养了１２０多万知识分子大军。目前，占朝鲜国民经济各部门职工总数２０％以上的技术人员、专家，已成为发展经济的中坚力量。学校为社会输送了大量人才，社会又是怎样促进教育的发展呢？
    朝鲜劳动党和政府一直认为，“社会应当成为学校的后盾”，并采取了相应的措施。政府规定，社会支援学校是培养后代义不容辞的责任，而学生家长支援学校则是一种高尚的美德。政府在全国开展了常年不断的“社会支援学校”的运动。朝鲜政务院和各级政府为全国各级学校安排了“后援”团体（支援单位）。这些后援团体，上至国家机关，下到学校周围的厂矿和单位。高等院校的后援团体由政务院直接负责安排，全国各中、小学由地方政府进行具体安排。
    国家规定，凡是被定为学校后援团体的单位，都必须把支援学校的工作纳入重要工作议事日程。社会支援学校的内容主要是修缮校舍、添置设备、改善环境、慰问教师等。学校后援单位支援学校的资金，一部分由国家拨给，但大部分由后援团体通过增产节约、废旧利用等办法筹措。后援团体支援学校的成果如何，要由上级部门定期检查总结，进行表扬和批评。
    记者最近采访了平壤平川男子高等中学，这所学校有两家后援单位：３．２１工厂和国家海运部。多年来，这两家后援单位，为学校办了大量实事。３．２１工厂为学校提供了一套供２０名学生学习驾驶汽车技术的室内综合教练驾驶台。海运部为提高学校教育质量和改善学习环境，向学校赠送了录像机、投影机、塑料地板、优质墙纸等，并为学校修建了游泳池和更新了旧桌椅。每逢节日，两家后援单位由党委书记带队到学校慰问教师，看望学生。说来也巧，这天正好碰上海运部的行政局长韩东制。他正在同学校商讨安排今年海运部支援学校的项目。女校长韩福顺兴奋地告诉记者，“我们这些后援团体送来的不仅是一批物资，更重要的是一片心意，使我们每个人都感到社会的温暖和鞭策。”
    今天，“社会支援学校”的运动，在朝鲜已制度化，千千万万个学校后援团体，正在为教育更上一层楼添砖加瓦。
