A patient who had been without a larynx for four years regained the ability to speak after receiving a new larynx implant and was discharged from the hospital on April 26. This marks the successful application of a new method for installing artificial titanium larynges, pioneered by Deputy Chief Physician Wen Changhuang of the 206th Hospital of the Shenyang Military Region. In just over a year, Wen has helped five laryngectomy patients regain their ability to speak. Wen previously made international headlines with his innovative "laryngectomy with artificial titanium larynx formation surgery," which earned him a gold medal at the 36th Brussels Eureka International Invention Exhibition.
