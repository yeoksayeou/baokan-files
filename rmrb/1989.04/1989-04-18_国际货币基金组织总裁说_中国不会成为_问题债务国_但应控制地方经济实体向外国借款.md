International Monetary Fund Managing Director Says
China Will Not Become a "Problem Debtor Nation"
But Should Control Local Economic Entities' Foreign Borrowing

BEIJING, April 18 (Xinhua) — The Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, who is currently visiting Beijing, said today that he believes China has a good ability to repay its debts and will not become a "problem debtor nation."

Camdessus said at a press conference this afternoon in response to a question from this agency's reporter that China is "very responsible and very cautious" in borrowing. The country's leaders understand the dangers of excessive borrowing. In terms of the size of the country, China's current debt level is still low, although the amount of external debt grew "a bit too fast" last year.

He pointed out, however, that many local economic entities now have the authority to borrow from foreign countries, which is a potential danger. If not strictly controlled, this could also lead to the country's debt burden becoming too heavy. Camdessus noted that the Chinese government has taken measures to strengthen the unified management of external debt, and he expressed his appreciation for this.

He said that it is precisely because of China's responsible attitude towards borrowing and its repayment capacity that China has not been included in the list of "problem debtor nations" by the International Monetary Fund. He expressed "no concern" that China will become a "problem debtor nation."

Regarding China's inflation, Camdessus said there are two choices in dealing with this issue: either return to the old highly centralized economic system, or use indirect macro-control measures such as monetary and budgetary policies. He believes that China's leaders are now very focused on using indirect macro-control measures, which is very wise, although this control system is not yet perfect.

He said that in the current stage, it is necessary to use direct administrative measures to assist indirect macro-control, but these temporary direct controls should be reduced as soon as possible. He expressed his belief that this is also the goal of the Chinese government.

He expressed his support for China's tight monetary policy. He said, "Without reducing the money supply, it is impossible to curb inflation."

Camdessus said that China's leaders' determination to carry out reforms has left a deep impression on him. He said that the success of China's reforms is not only crucial for China itself but also has significant implications for the world. He expressed that the International Monetary Fund will continue to support China's reforms in terms of funds and technology.

### 国际货币基金组织总裁说　中国不会成为“问题债务国”　但应控制地方经济实体向外国借款

　　国际货币基金组织总裁说
　　中国不会成为“问题债务国”
　　但应控制地方经济实体向外国借款
    新华社北京四月十八日电　（记者周树春）正在此间访问的国际货币基金组织总裁米歇尔·康德苏今天表示相信，中国具有很好的偿债能力，不可能成为“问题债务国家”。
    康德苏今天下午在记者招待会上回答本社记者提问时说，中国在借债上“很负责任，也很谨慎”，国家领导人明白过度举债的危险性。就国家大小而言，中国目前的负债水平还很低，尽管去年外债数额的增长“过快一点”。
    但他指出，现在很多地方经济实体有权向外国借款，这是一种潜在的危险，如不严加控制，也会使国家债台高筑。康德苏注意到中国政府已采取措施，加强外债的统一管理，对此他表示赞赏。
    他说，正是考虑到中国在借债上的负责态度及其偿债能力，中国未被列入国际货币基金组织的“问题债务国”名单。他表示“毫不担忧”中国会成为一个“问题债务国”。
    在谈到中国的通货膨胀时，康德苏说，面对这个问题有两种选择，要么回到高度集中的旧经济体制，要么利用诸如货币和预算政策等间接的宏观调控手段。他认为中国领导人现在很重视利用间接宏观调控手段，这是十分明智的，尽管这种调控体系尚不完善。
    他说，在现阶段用直接行政手段辅助间接宏观调控是必要的，但应尽早减少这种暂时的直接控制。他表示相信这也是中国政府的目标。
    他表示赞同中国紧缩银根的货币政策。他说，“不减少货币投放，就不可能抑制通货膨胀。”
    康德苏说，中国领导人致力于改革的坚决性给他留下深刻印象。他说，中国改革的成功不仅对中国自身至关重要，对全世界来说也是意义重大的。他表示，国际货币基金组织将继续在资金和技术上支持中国的改革。
