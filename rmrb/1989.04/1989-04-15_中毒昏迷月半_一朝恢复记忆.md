Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, April 14th.

A young man, after being in a coma for 45 days, fluently recited the multiplication tables.

The patient, Li Xiqiang, is 26 years old and from Yixin Village, Haicheng City, Liaoning Province. On February 8th, Li Xiqiang and his wife visited his father-in-law's home for the New Year. Both were poisoned by coal gas, and his wife died on the spot. On February 11th, Li Xiqiang was sent to the Central Hospital of the 19th Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways in Liaoyang. Upon admission, the patient was in a deep coma. The hospital immediately formed a rescue team and decided to use high-pressure oxygen, snake venom thrombolytic enzyme, and other treatments. On March 13th, the 33rd day of the coma, the patient could swallow when given water and showed expressions of pain when turning over. By March 26th, a miracle occurred: Li Xiqiang, who had been in a coma for 45 days, opened his eyes in the morning and called out "Mom."

　　中毒昏迷月半　一朝恢复记忆
    据新华社沈阳４月１４日电　（通讯员樊景文）一个小伙子在昏迷４５天之后，流利地背出了乘法口诀。
    患者叫李喜强，今年２６岁，是辽宁省海城市艺新村人。今年２月８日，李喜强和妻子到岳父家拜年，夫妻俩煤气中毒，妻子当即死亡。２月１１日，李喜强被送到驻地辽阳市的铁道部十九工程局中心医院。入院时患者呈深昏迷状态。医院立即组成抢救小组，确定采用高压氧和蛇毒抗栓酶等多种手段治疗。３月１３日，患者昏迷第３３天，喂水时可以吞咽，翻身时有痛苦表情。到３月２６日，奇迹出现了：昏迷已４５天的李喜强，早上睁开了眼睛，喊了一声“妈”。
