The idea of using a pocket-sized device in conjunction with artificial beacons in the sky to accurately guide travelers to any location on Earth seemed as fanciful as a daydream. However, in 1989, anyone with a few thousand dollars could purchase a marvelous pocket-sized navigation device developed by the United States—the Global Positioning System receiver.

For the U.S. Department of Defense, the successful development of the navigation satellite "Global Positioning System" marks a significant milestone. With the guidance of this system, missiles launched to the other side of the Earth can destroy targets with an accuracy of several feet. The Global Positioning System can accurately lead assault teams through dense, roadless forests to attack enemy fortresses, guide bombers to destroy specific enemy buildings, or navigate ships around dangerous reefs.

However, civilian applications may far exceed military uses. Commercial airplane pilots, train drivers, regular passenger ship captains, and even caravans can quickly start using this system. Related large receivers, sensors, and computers have already been tested on various military and civilian vehicles. This satellite system has been used to help surveyors improve map accuracy and guide polar explorers. The Burlington Northern Railway recently equipped its 17 diesel locomotives with experimental receivers to track the precise location of trains. The system continuously informs train drivers of the train's position with an error margin of 150 feet. Carrying such a device, travelers will not get lost in stormy seas or dense forests. Users of portable Global Positioning System receivers do not need navigation instruments and can follow the direction and accurate distance to any of the 50 destinations stored in the receiver's memory.

Several companies in the United States are developing these receivers. Magellan Systems Corporation plans to launch its product to the market this year, which will be the world's first portable navigation receiver.

Currently, there are 7 satellites in operation. These satellites are configured in 6 orbital planes to cover the globe from one pole to the other. With the help of ground-based fixed tracking stations broadcasting signals, each satellite continuously tracks its position on Earth and broadcasts information, notifying each receiver of the exact time the signal leaves the satellite.

Currently, there are not enough available satellites, so the system is still in the development stage and has not been fully operational. Therefore, many regions are not covered for more than 12 hours a day. Los Angeles is currently covered for only 7 hours a day. By the end of 1989, with 13 satellites in orbit, land and sea users will be able to navigate to any location on Earth 24 hours a day. The satellite network, scheduled to be completed by 1991, will provide rapid information, which is essential for spacecraft and missile flights.

Experts unanimously agree that "the impact of the Global Positioning System on navigation is almost as significant as the invention of the compass."

### 神奇的导航卫星  “全球定位系统”

　　神奇的导航卫星
    “全球定位系统”
    用一个袖珍装置同天空的人工信标相配合，准确无误地引导旅行者到达地球上任何地方，这种想法对于人们来说，犹如天马行空一样不切实际。但在１９８９年，任何身有几千美元的人都可买到美国研制成功的一种神奇的袖珍导航装置——全球定位系统接收机。
    对美国国防部来说，导航卫星“全球定位系统”大功告成是一个里程碑。借助于该系统引导，飞往地球另一面的导弹可以以几十英尺的精确度击毁目标。全球定位系统可准确地带领袭击队穿过无路的密林去袭击敌堡垒，引导轰炸机去炸毁敌人的特定建筑物，或指引船只绕过危险的暗礁。
    但是，民用可能远远超过军用。商业飞机驾驶员、火车司机、定期班船船长，甚至驮队也能很快开始使用这个系统。相关的庞大接收机、传感器和计算机已试装到各种军用民用车船上。这个卫星系统已用于帮助测绘人员提高地图精确度和指点极地探险人员。伯林顿北部铁路最近用实验接收机装备了它的１７台内燃机车，作为跟踪行驶列车准确位置的手段。该系统不断通知火车司机列车所在位置，误差在１５０英尺范围内。把这样一个装置带在身边，旅行者就不致在狂风恶浪的海洋里或无路可寻的莽林中迷途。便携式全球定位系统接收机使用者不需要用导航仪器，可以沿着接收机存储器储存的５０个目的地中的任何一个的大圆周读出方向和准确距离。
    美国已有好几家公司在开发这种接收机。麦哲伦系统公司预计今年将向市场推出它生产的装置，这将是世界上第一种便携式导航接收机。
    现在有７个卫星在运行。这些卫星配置到６个轨道平面，以便从一极到另一极覆盖全球。借助于地面固定跟踪站广播的信号，每一卫星持续跟踪它在地球上的位置，向地球播出信息，把信号离开卫星时的准确时刻通知每一个接收机。
    现在可用的卫星还少，所以这个系统尚处于发展阶段，未全面投入运行，因此，有大部分地区一天１２小时以上未能被覆盖。洛杉矶现在一天只覆盖７个小时。到１９８９年年底，由于有１３个卫星在轨道运行，陆地和海上用户航行到地球上任何一个地方能全天得到导航。按计划到１９９１年完成的卫星网将提供快速信息，这对飞船和导弹飞行是不可少的。
    专家们一致认为：“全球定位系统对航行的影响几乎和罗盘的发明一样重大。”
