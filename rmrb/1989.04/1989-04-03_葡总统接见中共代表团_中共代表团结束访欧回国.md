　　葡总统接见中共代表团
    中共代表团结束访欧回国
    新华社里斯本３月３０日电  葡萄牙总统马里奥·苏亚雷斯３０日在总统府接见了由中共中央政治局委员、中组部部长宋平为首的中共代表团。双方进行了友好谈话。
    苏亚雷斯总统说，葡中两国有着传统的友好关系，葡萄牙“一直在致力于加强和发展”同中国的传统关系。令人高兴的是，１９８７年４月葡、中两国政府总理在北京签署了关于澳门问题的联合声明之后，两国的友好与合作关系得到了进一步加强与发展，葡萄牙十分感兴趣同中国保持这种友好合作关系。
    宋平在讲话中说，中国政府也像葡萄牙政府一样，十分重视加强和发展与葡萄牙在政治、经济和文化等各个领域的友好合作关系。宋平对苏亚雷斯多年来为加强中、葡友好合作关系所做出的贡献表示赞赏。
    新华社里斯本３月３１日电　由中共中央政治局委员、中组部部长宋平率领的中共代表团在结束了对葡萄牙的访问后，今天离开这里回国。
