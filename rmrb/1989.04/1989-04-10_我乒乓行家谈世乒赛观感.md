As the 40th World Table Tennis Championships came to a close, reporters at the Westfalenhalle in Dortmund interviewed several prominent figures from China's table tennis community. They shared their views on the tournament and the future development of table tennis in China.

Xu Yansheng said, "From this competition, it's clear that European male players have taken the lead, while the women's advantage still lies in Asia. The Swedish men's team is a representative of the rapid improvement in European table tennis. Although their personnel and playing style haven't changed much, their techniques are more comprehensive, and their average strength has increased. Therefore, they won the men's team and singles titles. The Chinese men's team has aging players and lacks new techniques. They haven't solved problems related to spin, speed, serves, and receiving serves, so their loss was expected. In the next World Championships, the men's team competition format will change from 9 games to 5 wins to 5 games to 3 wins, shortening the time. This format increases the randomness of victory and defeat, which the Swedish men's team does not welcome. Now that others are progressing rapidly and surpassing us, we should learn from them, summarize our experiences and lessons, and catch up."

Former women's singles world champion Qiu Zhonghui believes that in recent years, China has been at the forefront of scientific research on table tennis techniques, a point even acknowledged and praised multiple times by the president of the International Table Tennis Federation, Ogimura. However, in the past two years, our table tennis research work has not progressed much and has encountered significant difficulties, mainly due to a lack of funds. A researcher's annual budget is only enough for a round-trip from Beijing to Shanghai, making it difficult to carry out work.

Hu Benquan, the former coach of the men's team known as the "unsung hero," said that many young athletes are not focused on training and want to go abroad to play and earn money. This problem needs to be addressed through policy. If someone becomes famous and wants to leave, it's not appropriate for them not to serve the country. In the future, regulations should be made to allow players to go abroad to play only after the age of 28, and a portion of their earnings should be returned to the country. Athletes from countries like the Soviet Union have such regulations when they go abroad to play. If this problem is resolved, it will be beneficial for the stability of the domestic table tennis team.

### 我乒乓行家谈世乒赛观感

　　我乒乓行家谈世乒赛观感
    第４０届世界乒乓球锦标赛闭幕之际，记者在多特蒙德威斯特法伦体育馆采访了几位中国乒乓球界知名人士，请他们就本届比赛及今后我国乒乓球运动的发展等问题各抒己见。
    徐寅生说，从这次比赛看，欧洲男选手占了上风，女子优势仍在亚洲。瑞典男队是欧洲乒乓球迅速提高的突出代表，他们的人员和打法虽然同以前没有太大变化，但技术更为全面，平均实力更强了，所以夺得了男子团体和单打两项冠军。中国男队人员老化，技术没有新东西，在旋转与速度的结合以及发球、接发球等技术问题上都没有解决好，失利在预料之中。下一届世界锦标赛男子团体改变赛制，从９盘５胜改为５盘３胜，缩短了时间，这种赛制胜负偶然性更大，瑞典男队不大欢迎赛制的改变。现在人家进步快，超过了我们，我们应当好好向人家学习，总结经验教训，迎头赶上去。
    前女子单打世界冠军丘钟惠认为，前些年对乒乓球技术的科学研究工作，中国一直是走在世界前列的，这一点连国际乒联主席荻村也承认并多次赞扬。这两年我们乒乓球科研工作进展不大，遇到很大困难，主要是经费太缺，一个科研人员一年的经费只够从北京到上海的路费，这怎么开展工作呢？
    当年被称为“无名英雄”的男队教练胡炳权说，不少年轻运动员不安心训练，都想自己出国打球挣钱，这个问题要从政策上加以解决。如果出了一点名就想走，不为国家效力那太不应该。以后应规定２８岁以后才能派到国外打球，所得收入应交给国家一部分。苏联等国家运动员出国打球都是这样规定的。如果这个问题解决好，有利于国内乒乓球队伍的稳定。
