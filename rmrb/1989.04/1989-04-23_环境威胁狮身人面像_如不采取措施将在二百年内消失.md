	Environmental Threats to the Sphinx
	If No Measures Are Taken, It May Disappear in 200 Years

	According to a report by the Daily Telegraph on the 17th, scientists are concerned that if urgent protective measures are not taken, the world-famous Sphinx in Egypt may erode and disappear within 200 years.

	The Sphinx was carved from limestone approximately 4,600 years ago. It is 240 feet long, 60 feet wide, and over 60 feet high. It was buried in the desert and was only discovered in the 19th century. It is one of the world's most renowned historical sites.

	Modern environmental issues are accelerating the destruction of the Sphinx: air pollution, vibrations from cars and airplanes, the salt content in groundwater, and the rise in water levels after the construction of the Aswan Dam.

	Limestone is of poor quality and easily erodes. Water and salt seep into the stone cracks, often causing large stone slabs to peel off. Last February, a 300-kilogram stone block fell from the right shoulder of the Sphinx.

	Egyptian scientists have called for immediate action to study the following issues: measuring the impact of cars, airplanes, construction sites, and earthquakes on the Sphinx; determining if the water level has risen and mapping the cracks on the Sphinx; and measuring the mineral crystallinity and water absorption properties of the rock.

### 环境威胁狮身人面像  如不采取措施将在二百年内消失

　　环境威胁狮身人面像    
    如不采取措施将在二百年内消失
    新华社伦敦电  据《每日电讯报》１７日报道，科学家担心，如果不采取紧急保护措施，世界著名的埃及狮身人面像在２００年内会风化消失。
    埃及狮身人面像大约于４６００年前用石灰岩凿刻成，长２４０英尺，宽６０英尺，高６０多英尺，一直埋在沙漠里，１９世纪才发现，是闻名于世的古迹之一。
    现代的环境问题正在加速狮身人面像的破坏：空气污染、汽车和飞机的振动、地下水中的含盐量、阿斯旺水坝建成后水位升高等。
    石灰岩石质差，容易风化，水和盐分渗入石缝，往往会使整块石板剥落。去年２月，一块３００公斤重的石块从狮身人面像右肩掉下来。
    埃及科学家呼吁，应该立刻采取措施，研究下列问题：测定汽车、飞机、建筑工地和地震等对狮身人面像的影响；测定水位是否升高，绘制出狮身人面像的裂纹图；测定岩石的矿物结晶性质及其容水性质。
