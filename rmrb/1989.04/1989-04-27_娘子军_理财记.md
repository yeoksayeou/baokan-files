The "Women's Brigade" of financial management

	“Now that the finances are tight, I have a bias, always wanting to cut administrative expenses and invest more in science, education, and agriculture.” The 42-year-old budget section chief, Tian Lingyu, began to talk about her financial management strategies. Lingyu was deeply concerned about the dilapidated conditions of the Ling Shi Middle School, which was housed in a broken-down temple with poor teaching facilities. She carefully calculated and managed to allocate 120,000 yuan to support the construction of a new teaching building. When she found that the teachers' dormitories were in short supply, she raised another 100,000 yuan from various sources to help build a teachers' dormitory.

	Not long ago, we visited the Ling Shi County Finance Bureau. Here, six out of the eight sections are led by female section chiefs. They are all model Communist Party members who work diligently at their posts and are known by the people as the "Women's Brigade" of financial management.

	The "female manager" of the enterprise, Yang Huichun, is skilled at raising funds. At 32 years old, she serves as the section chief of the industrial enterprise section. She spends little time in her office, often visiting factories and workshops, making friends with enterprise managers. The county's fertilizer plant and ironworks have poor production performance, so she helps the enterprise's accountants with accounting and improves management levels. Workers see this modestly dressed female cadre busy with everyone's affairs, neglecting her own family, and praise her, saying, "There are still good people in the Party!"

	The 48-year-old Cao Qiumei is the eldest sister among them. As she smoked, she said, "My job as the section chief of the supervision section is not light!" To establish a county-wide financial supervision network, she hired 22 financial supervisors and 19 financial supervision correspondents. Previously, the county finance bureau had no supervision system. After extensive investigations and consultations, she wrote a 3,000-word, 16-point "Financial Supervision System," combining professional supervision with public supervision, and implementing a joint inspection system, which achieved good results. The entire province's financial system promoted Cao Qiumei's supervision method. She also actively receives and handles letters and visits from the public and reports of corruption. The county's family planning guidance station discovered problems such as untimely accounting reports and discrepancies in bank accounts. Qiumei immediately went to investigate and, in collaboration with relevant departments, did detailed work, leading a 25-year-old accountant to voluntarily surrender, recover embezzled and misappropriated public funds totaling 7,400 yuan, and saved a young person, educating a large number of financial personnel.

	Ling Shi County Finance Bureau attaches great importance to selecting and training female cadres. The 28-year-old deputy section chief of the commercial enterprise section, Cao Yuping, originally a junior college graduate, felt that her knowledge was insufficient after working for two years, so she applied to the Central Institute of Finance and Economics correspondence class. Little Cao agreed with her husband: "First study, then have children." She moved her bed to the office, ate at the collective canteen, worked during the day, and studied at night, persisting for three years and becoming an outstanding student. The deputy section chief of the fund management section, Ren Jianping, and the deputy section chief of the comprehensive section, Guo Mulan, are not to be outdone. They are both participating in correspondence courses for undergraduate studies.

	"We rely on the 'Women's Brigade' to put on a big show!" said the director of the county finance bureau, Niu Jinhua, proudly.

　　“娘子军”理财记
    段存章　续继明
    “现在财政紧张，我有个偏心眼，总想压缩行政经费开支，多往科技、教育、农业上投资”。４２岁的预算股股长田玲玉开口讲起她的理财之道。灵石中学住在破庙里，教学设备也不好。田玲玉急在心上，左盘右算，硬是挤出１２万元资金，扶持建起一座教学大楼。教师宿舍紧张，她又多方筹集资金１０万元，帮助盖起教师宿舍楼。
    前不久，我们访问了山西灵石县财政局，这里八股一室有六个女股长，她们都是模范的共产党员，在各自的工作岗位上尽心尽力，被群众称为理财把关的“娘子军”。
    企业“女管家”杨惠琴聚财有方。今年３２岁，担任工业企业股股长。她在办公室坐的少，常常到工厂、下车间转，广交企业的朋友。县化肥厂、铁厂生产效益差，她帮助企业会计搞核算，提高管理水平。工人们看到这位穿着朴素的女干部整天为大家的事忙，顾不上管理自己的小家，都称赞说：“党内还是好样的多！”
    ４８岁的曹秋梅是她们中的大姐姐。她边抽烟边说：“我这监察股股长，肩上的担子不轻呀！”为了建立全县财政监察网络，她聘请财政监察员２２名、财政监察通讯员１９名。以前县财政局没有监察制度，她经过多方调查，征求意见，写出３０００字、１６条的《财政监察制度》，把专业监督和群众监督结合起来，推行联审互查制，收到很好的效果。全省财政系统推广了曹秋梅监察法。她还积极接待处理群众来信来访和举报案。县计划生育指导站发现会计表报不及时，银行账不相符等问题，秋梅及时前去调查，配合有关部门做了细致的工作，使一位２５岁的会计自动投案，追回挪用、贪污公款７４００元，挽救了一个青年人，教育了一大批财会人员。
    灵石县财政局重视选拔和培养女干部。２８岁的商业企业股副股长曹玉萍，原是中专毕业生，她参加工作两年后，觉得知识不够用，又报考了中央财经学院函授班。小曹与爱人商定：“先读书，后生孩”，她把铺盖搬到办公室，上集体灶吃饭，白天工作，夜晚攻读，坚持三年，成为优秀学员。基金管理股副股长任建萍、综合股副股长郭木兰也不示弱，她俩正在参加大专函授学习。
    “我们靠的是‘娘子军’唱大戏！”县财政局局长牛晋华自豪地说。
