In the television series "Green Shade," there is a scene where the English teacher, Miss Ren, learns that she will ultimately be forced out of Shuiren Middle School. In her anger, she tells He Zihan, "This is what you call insiders targeting insiders, making them even more skilled." In real life, such incidents are not uncommon. Some people with significant achievements lament that it would be better to have an outsider as a leader, to avoid the constant humiliation from insiders who use tactics that are hard to explain or understand.

Insiders are effective at targeting others because they know how to use methods that both harm the target and leave no trace, making it impossible for anyone, including the victim, to prove that they were targeted. In "Green Shade," the school administration clearly dislikes this female teacher who lacks a degree, is rebellious, and dares to break school rules by wearing fashionable skirts to class. However, they use the pretext of a job transfer to "promote" her to a research group leader at a regular middle school. Do they look down on those without degrees? But they promoted you; do they want to drive you out of the school? But this is to strengthen the teaching staff at regular middle schools. In the past, outsiders targeting insiders often left many loopholes, and there was a chance for rectification. Now, the targeting is done in a way that seems reasonable, leaving the victim with no way to express their grievances.

The bad habit of "colleagues are enemies, scholars disparage each other" has not disappeared from real life. There are indeed people who do not work diligently or study hard to catch up with or surpass others. Instead, they use every means possible to use their power and irresponsible words to target and harm others, wasting their energy on endless internal conflicts. These people are despicable because they have more cunning strategies and the cover of being intellectuals. One must be vigilant against them.

### “内行整内行，整得更在行”

　　“内行整内行，整得更在行”
    电视连续剧《绿荫》里有这么一段情节，当教英语的任老师得知自己最终被赶出树人中学时，悲愤地对何子寒说：“这叫内行整内行，整得更在行。”在现实生活中这样的事确实不乏其例，以至有些颇有成就的人哀叹说，还不如找个外行当领导，免得天天受说不清、道不明的窝囊气。
    内行整人之所以在行，因为这种人知道采取什么手段，既整了人，又叫上下左右包括被整的人谁也说不出是在整人。在《绿荫》里明明校方看不惯这位既无文凭又桀骜不驯、且敢于冲破校规穿着式样新颖的裙子上课的女教师，却以调动工作为由“提升”她到普通中学当教研组长。你说校方看不起没文凭的人么？但提升了你；你说把你赶出校门么？但这是为了加强普通中学师资力量的需要。以往外行整人，往往漏洞百出，还有个平反改正的时候。现在呢，整得合情合理，啥时候都叫你有苦说不出。
    同行是冤家、文人相轻的恶习在现实生活中并没有绝迹。确有一些人不去勤奋工作，钻研学问以赶上超过别人，总是千方百计地运用手中的权力和不负责任的嘴巴去整人、伤人，把精力放在无尽无止的内耗上。这种人之可恶在于他们有高于别人的招数，且有着文化人的招牌。对他们不提防是不行的。                      杜元铎
