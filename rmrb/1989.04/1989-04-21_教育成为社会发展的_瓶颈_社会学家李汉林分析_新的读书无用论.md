The "new theory of the uselessness of reading" has sparked public concern and debate. Li Hanlin, the youngest researcher at the Institute of Sociology of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, at the age of 35, analyzes the causes and solutions to the educational predicament from a sociological perspective.

Huang: Education, as a social phenomenon and a product of social culture, has the most basic social function of preserving and transmitting culture through the imparting of skills and knowledge.

Li: From a sociological perspective, the main task of education is to systematically socialize the younger generation. "Socialization" refers to the process by which individuals continuously receive cultural transmission in society, learning and adapting to the values, attitudes, and psychophysical skills required by the overall political and social environment and specific circumstances. In any society, people always try to use education to transmit and instill a specific society's political, economic, and social cultural attitudes and traditions into the younger generation. At the same time, people use education to systematically impart the knowledge that humanity has acquired to the younger generation, so that they can truly become members of society.

Today, our society is in a transitional period from tradition to modernization. The changes in social culture necessitate that the realization of education's socialization function must be conditioned by adjustments and changes in the educational system's structure. This is mainly reflected in the complete implementation of equal opportunities in the admission system; in the allocation system, the distribution of talent must be fully adjusted according to the needs of science, economics, and social development; in teaching content, professional structure, curriculum setting, educational methods, and the behavior structure of teachers, adjustments must also be made according to the needs of scientific and technological development and economic development.

Huang: These points precisely address the various shortcomings in our current educational system. For many years, we have essentially been achieving recognition of science and culture and adapting to a new society within the framework of the old educational system. The result is that the socialization function of education has hit a "bottleneck." Today's recipients of education have lost their standards for values and behavior, and their psychological and adaptive abilities are becoming increasingly weak. The cries of "reading is useless" somewhat reflect the confusion of a generation.

Li: This problem can be further traced to the social distribution function of education.

We know that education, through cultivating individuals to adapt to complex social roles, distributing talent, and selecting talent, realizes its social role distribution function. Here, there is a prerequisite, that is, the distribution of talent must meet the needs of society. When society advances, and science and technology and the economy develop, but our educational content and methods, the depth and breadth of education, still remain in the traditional framework, far from being able to adapt to the structural changes in society's demand for talent, the utility of knowledge will inevitably be called into question, and the difficulty in distributing talent will be unavoidable. This deeply reflects the lag and insufficient effective supply in our educational undertakings.

Huang: It is evident that while our commodity economy is developing rapidly, human resource investment, which plays a decisive role in economic development, is shrinking. How do we explain this "contradictory" phenomenon between education and the economy?

Li: Theoretically, education, as the production base for knowledge labor, has two important characteristics: one is a long production cycle, from primary school to a bachelor's degree, it takes 16 years; another characteristic is that, in a strict sense, the benefits that education brings to society and economic development are indirect, reflected through the behavior of the educated knowledge workers. The value created by the education sector for society is not as direct, obvious, and quick to show results as the economic sector. Therefore, although people can acknowledge the importance of education in words or theory, in actual actions, they always unconsciously regard education as a long-term soft investment. Especially when our leaders at all levels try to show their abilities and quickly establish new achievements, they inevitably allocate most of the manpower, material resources, and financial resources to economic construction. This reflects the short-term and utilitarian nature of our government's behavior.

The seriousness of the problem lies in the fact that the shrinkage of human resource investment makes it difficult to improve the educational environment and conditions, which directly restricts the improvement of educational quality and deeply affects the stability of the teaching staff. In fact, the demonstration effect of impoverished teachers, the devaluation of knowledge, and the social reality of the higher the culture, the lower the income, all greatly affect students' enthusiasm for learning, causing an educational crisis. To change this situation, I believe the most important thing is to genuinely improve everyone's, especially the leaders', understanding of the functions and characteristics of education.

Huang: People across the Pacific in America regard the development of education as "planting today, harvesting for life." China's prosperity relies on the "Four Modernizations," and the first among them is the modernization of science and technology. How do we understand "education for national rejuvenation" from the relationship between education and science?

Li: The relationship between education and science is mainly reflected in the scientific function of education. Education is not only the production and reproduction base for knowledge labor but also the base for knowledge updating. The quality of education directly relates to the quality of scientific research. If we say that science is the driving force and source of economic development, then education is the driving force and source of scientific development. Without developing education, science cannot develop, and economic development will lose its vitality and vigor. This logical relationship between education, science, and economic development is the basis and entire meaning of education for national rejuvenation.

　　教育成为社会发展的“瓶颈”   
    ——社会学家李汉林分析“新的读书无用论”
    黄传芳
    “新的读书无用论”引起民忧众议。中国社会科学院社会学研究所最年轻的研究员、３５岁的李汉林从社会学的视角分析了教育困境的原因与出路。
    黄：教育作为一种社会现象，同时也作为一种社会文化的产物，它最基本的社会功能是通过传授技艺和知识来保存与传递文化。
    李：按社会学的说法，教育的主要任务是有系统地将年轻的一代社会化。所谓“社会化”，是指个人在社会中不断接受文化的传递，学习、适应整体政治社会及特别环境所需要的某些价值观念和身心技能的过程。在任何一个社会里，人们总是企图利用教育来向年轻一代传递与灌输一个特定社会中政治的、经济的以及社会的文化和传统的态度。同时，人们也利用教育把人类迄今已获得的知识系统地传授给年轻的一代，以使其尔后真正成为社会中的一分子。
    今天，我国社会正处于从传统到现代化的转型期。社会文化的变迁，逼使教育社会化功能的实现必须以教育系统结构上的调整与变迁为条件。这主要表现在招生制度上完全实行机会均等；在分配制度上完全按科学、经济与社会发展需要调节人才的分配；在教学内容、专业结构、课程设置、教育方式及师长的行为结构上，也要按科学技术与经济发展的需要加以调整。
    黄：这些正好切中当前我国教育系统中的种种弊端。多年来，我们基本上是在旧的教育系统结构中实现对科学文化的认同和对新型社会的适应，其结果使教育社会化功能走入“瓶颈”。今天的受教育者失去了价值与行为取向的标准，其心理与能力上的适应性愈来愈弱。“读书无用”的呼喊多少道出一代人的无所适从。
    李：这个问题还可以从教育的社会分配功能中进一步探源。
    我们知道，教育是通过培养个人适应纷繁复杂的社会角色、分配人才和选择人才从而实现它的社会角色分配功能的。这里也有一个前提条件，那就是人才的分配必须适应社会的需要。当社会前进了，科学技术和经济发展了，而我们的教育内容与方式、教育的深度与广度却仍然停留在传统的一套上，远不能适应社会对人才需求结构性变化的时候，知识的功用必然出现疑惑，人才分配难也不可避免。它深刻地反映了我们教育事业发展的滞后和有效供给不足。
    黄：有目共睹，一方面我国的商品经济正在迅猛发展，而另一方面作为对经济发展起决定性作用的人力投资却出现萎缩。如何解释教育与经济的这种“背反”现象呢？
    李：从理论上说，教育作为知识劳动力的生产基地有两个重要特点：一个是生产周期长，从小学到大学本科毕业，就要花去１６年的时间；另一个特点是，在严格意义上，教育给社会与经济发展带来的效益都是间接性的，都是通过所培养的知识劳动者的行为反映出来。教育部门为社会所创造的价值还没有经济部门表现得那么直接、那么直观、那么见效快。所以，尽管人们在口头上或理论上都能够承认教育的重要性，但在实际行动中却总是不自觉地把教育看作一种长期性的软投资。特别是当我们各级政府领导都企图显示自己才能、尽快创立新政绩的时候，就不可避免地把绝大部分人力、物力和财力放在了经济建设上，这反映了我们政府行为的短期性和功利性。
    问题的严重性还在于，人力投资的萎缩，使教育环境与条件的改善遇到很大的困难，这既直接制约教育质量的提高，也深刻影响教师队伍的稳定。事实上，清贫教师队伍的示范效应以及知识贬值、文化越高收入越低的社会现实，无不极大地影响着学生学习的积极性，使教育发生危机。要改变这种状况，我认为，最重要的是需要实实在在地提高大家、尤其是领导干部对教育功能与特性的认识。
    黄：大洋彼岸的美国人把发展教育看作是“今日播种，终生结果”。中国的富强依靠“四个现代化”，而其首要当是科技的现代化。那么，如何从教育与科学的关系中理解“教育兴国”？
    李：教育与科学的关系主要体现在教育的科学功能上。教育不仅是知识劳动力生产与再生产的基地，同时也是知识更新的基地。教育的质量直接关系到科学研究的质量。如果我们说，科学是经济发展的动力与源泉，那么，教育则是科学发展的动力与源泉。不发展教育，科学无从发展，经济的发展也会因之失去生机与活力。这种教育、科学与经济发展的逻辑关系，就是教育兴国的依据和全部意义。
