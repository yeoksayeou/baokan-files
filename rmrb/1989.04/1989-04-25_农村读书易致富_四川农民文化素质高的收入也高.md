    Reading Brings Prosperity to Rural Areas
    – Higher Cultural Quality of Farmers in Sichuan Means Higher Income

    A survey of 5,500 rural households in 55 counties of Sichuan Province reveals that the success of farmers' production and management, as well as their income levels, are closely related to their cultural quality. Farmers with higher cultural quality have the following advantages:

    Higher income levels. In 1988, the per capita net income of households with high school education and above was 475.48 yuan, those with junior high school education was 466.53 yuan, those with primary school education was 422.10 yuan, and those who were illiterate or semi-illiterate was 430.71 yuan. Households with higher educational attainment had higher income levels compared to those with lower educational attainment.

    More paths to prosperity, faster development of secondary and tertiary industries. Farmers with higher educational attainment have broader horizons, are more open to new things, dare to invest, and are good at management, thus having more paths to prosperity. The development of secondary and tertiary industries is better than that of households with lower educational attainment. In 1988, the per capita income from secondary and tertiary industries for households with high school education and above was 87.02 yuan, junior high school was 103.10 yuan, primary school was 76.70 yuan, all higher than the 40.44 yuan for illiterate or semi-illiterate households.

    Higher commercialization rate of agricultural products. In 1988, the per capita cash income from selling agricultural and sideline products was 89.49 yuan for households with high school education and above, 89.03 yuan for junior high school, 88.62 yuan for primary school, while illiterate or semi-illiterate households had only 56.12 yuan. The commercialization rate of agricultural and sideline products was 55.3% for households with high school education and above, 56.5% for junior high school, 53.7% for primary school, and 41% for illiterate or semi-illiterate households.

    Higher economic benefits. Farmers with higher educational attainment can more accurately master advanced agricultural technology. Therefore, the per capita net income provided by every 100 yuan of productive fixed assets for households with high school education and above was 16.73 yuan more than junior high school households, 19.54 yuan more than primary school households, and 182.82 yuan more than illiterate or semi-illiterate households, which is 1.2 times higher.

    More investment in intelligence. In 1988, the per capita investment in intelligence for households with high school education and above reached 12.63 yuan, which is twice as much as illiterate or semi-illiterate households.

    Broader connections with the outside world. In 1988, the per capita transportation and postal fees for households with high school education and above were 3.48 yuan, which is 2.7 times that of illiterate or semi-illiterate households.

    The above situations indicate that the level of cultural quality has become an important factor constraining farmers' income and consumption. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to farmers' investment in intelligence and quickly improve farmers' cultural level.

　　农村读书易致富   
    ——四川农民文化素质高的收入也高
    四川省农村调查队  皮之荣  黄强
    四川省５５个县５５００户农村住户抽样调查资料表明，农民生产经营的好坏、收入水平的高低与其文化素质有密切关系。文化素质高的农民有如下优势：
    收入水平高。　１９８８年具有高中以上文化程度的农户人均纯收入为４７５．４８元，初中文化程度户为４６６．５３元，小学文化程度户为４２２．１０元，文盲半文盲户为４３０．７１元。文化程度高的农户收入水平高于文化程度低的农户。
    致富门路广，二三产业发展快。　文化程度高的农民眼界开阔，容易接受新事物，敢投资，善经营，致富门路多，二三产业发展比文化低的农户好。１９８８年，高中以上程度的农户人均二三产业收入为８７．０２元，初中户为１０３．１０元，小学户为７６．７０元，均比文盲半文盲户的４０．４４元高。
    农产品商品率高。　１９８８年农户人均出售农副产品的现金收入，高中以上户为８９．４９元，初中户为８９．０３元，小学户为８８．６２元，而文盲半文盲户只有５６．１２元。农副产品商品率，高中以上户为５５．３％，初中户为５６．５％，小学户为５３．７％，文盲半文盲户为４１％。
    经济效益高。　文化程度高的农民能较准确地掌握先进的农技知识，因此，高中以上文化程度的农户每百元生产性固定资产提供的纯收入比初中户多１６．７３元，比小学户多１９．５４元，比文盲半文盲户多１８２．８２元，高出１．２倍。
    智力投资多。　１９８８年，高中以上户人均智力投资达１２．６３元，比文盲半文盲户多２倍。
    与外界联系广。　１９８８年，高中以上户人均交通邮电费３．４８元，是文盲半文盲户的２．７倍。
    以上情况表明，文化素质的高低已成为制约农民收入和消费的重要因素。因此，必须重视农民的智力投资，尽快提高农民的文化水平。
