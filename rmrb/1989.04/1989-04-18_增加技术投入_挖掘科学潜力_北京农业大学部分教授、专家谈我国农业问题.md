	Increasing Technological Input and Tapping Scientific Potential
	Beijing Agricultural University Professors and Experts Discuss China's Agricultural Issues

	Currently, China's agricultural issues have drawn attention and discussion from various sectors. Recently, experts and professors from Beijing Agricultural University discussed China's agricultural situation, basic understanding of agriculture, and strategies.

	Shi Yuancun (Professor, President of Beijing Agricultural University): Developed countries' agriculture is gradually breaking free from the "resource-based agriculture" mold. Modern agriculture development has two main features: a large amount of technological input and high concentration of natural resources per unit; and a large amount of capital and modern material inputs. These constitute the basic conditions for humans to gradually overcome resource constraints. Although the speed and models of agricultural development vary among countries, they all go through the process of natural agriculture → resource-based agriculture → modern agriculture. This means that the key factors for agricultural development at different stages are different; the transition from relying mainly on land and labor to relying mainly on modern material and technological elements is the basic feature of modern agriculture. Comparative agricultural research tells us that land resource constraints are not insurmountable "bottlenecks." Relying on science and technology and transforming China's vast human resources into human capital is a realistic choice for developing our agriculture.

	Currently, the mechanism for transferring domestic scientific and technological achievements to production is not well established, and the technological input environment is poor, resulting in many good technologies being unable to play a role in production for a long time. The key is how to create a good policy and market environment to ensure the sustained enthusiasm of producers and to strengthen effective scientific, technological, financial, and material inputs.

	Liu Xunhao (Professor, Director of the Crop Research Room): China's agriculture still has potential. The focus should be on improving farmland productivity and farmers' quality, developing a Chinese-style high-yield, high-income, sustainable, and civilized land-intensive agriculture. If we can achieve this for 500 million mu or 1 billion mu of farmland, China's problems will be much easier to solve.

	Liu Shaobo (Professor, Director of the Livestock Economics Room): China is currently still in a state of backward agricultural technology and low production efficiency. Taking livestock as an example, converting 1 kilogram of meat requires at least 8-9 kilograms of concentrate (including grains, bran, and feed), while in developed countries in Western Europe, it does not exceed 5 kilograms. It can be seen that as long as we seriously carry out technological transformation, China still has considerable potential. China's per capita resource ownership is similar to that of the UK, with about 1.8 mu of arable land per person and approximately 400 kilograms of grain per person (UK: 425 kilograms), but the per capita meat production in the UK is 56 kilograms, while in China it is only 20 kilograms. As long as we rely on science and technology, there is still potential.

	Indeed, due to the population problem, China will not only maintain a dual structure for a long time but also a multi-tiered structure with different levels. Therefore, different systems should be implemented according to regional differences. Developed areas should undergo large-scale technological transformations and appropriately develop large-scale operations, which will definitely result in significant increases in agricultural products. In impoverished mountainous areas, it is possible to consider dividing land to households and carrying out large-scale farmland transformations in a private manner. Just taking terraced fields as an example, it is estimated that there will be significant results, at least it will not drag down the overall economic development of the country.

	Mao Dalu (Professor, Vice President of Beijing Agricultural University): Modern scientific research has proven that on the basis of organic fertilizers, increasing the input of chemical fertilizers is an important agricultural technology measure to achieve high input and high output. Organic fertilizers can improve soil fertility, and chemical fertilizers can also improve soil fertility. Both can improve the ecological environment, increase crop yields, and improve crop quality. Currently, grain prices are high on the international market, while fertilizer prices are falling (wheat: fertilizer = 1.68:1 price ratio). It is confident to produce 2 tons of grain with 1 ton of fertilizer, so importing fertilizer is more effective for developing China's agricultural production than importing grain. Like developed countries, we should establish a scientific fertilizer consultation service system to guide farmers in scientific fertilization and achieve "optimal formula fertilization" to improve fertilizer efficiency.

	Yang Shimou (Director of the Agricultural Education Research Room): The agricultural crisis in developed capitalist countries often manifests as overproduction, while in socialist countries it often manifests as shortages. If China can properly handle the relationship between agriculture and farmers, agricultural potential can be further tapped. In developed capitalist countries, the proportion of agriculture in the gross national product is already very small, but they still implement a series of policies to protect agriculture and farmers, which is reasonable.

	Zheng Jianfei (Professor): To address the stagnation in grain production since 1985, it is suggested to promote grain production through the following four points to achieve gradual stabilization and increase.

	First, open market prices to make agricultural product prices and production material prices, as well as small daily necessities, tend to be reasonable, making it beneficial for farmers to farm. The premise is to ensure the collection of "land tax" on the basis of 1/10 of the national total output of grain to guarantee the supply of 2 billion urban residents, with an annual supply of 720 billion jin. Other industries, livestock, and tourism grain should be opened.

	Second, expand the scale of operations: transforming small farms into large farms is a common experience in developing and developed countries. The forms are diverse, solving the problems of mobility, supply, credit, and production scale. The purpose is to reduce intermediate links and facilitate national investment and technology promotion.

	Third, leverage technological effects: agricultural scientists generally agree that "good seeds" can increase production by 10%, fertilizers by 10%, and water conservancy by 20%, which is undeniable. However, the state must invest a certain amount of funds and provide key support.

	Fourth, gradually expand the number of commercial grain counties to 400, using the county as a unit, exchanging grain for input is feasible. If a county can produce 500 million to 1 billion jin, then commercial grain counties can provide 30 billion jin of grain, striving to reduce imported grain, which is of great significance.

	Li Xiaoyun (Ph.D., Director of the Agricultural Development Strategy Research Room): Over the past decade, rural reforms have achieved tremendous successes, with significant increases in agricultural production levels. However, the growth of agricultural productivity has been minimal, and agricultural productivity has not increased in proportion to the output level. China's agriculture has entered a stage that requires comprehensive inputs. Overemphasizing any single input factor is not beneficial to agricultural development. The basic point of current policy formulation should be: 1. Break through ideological constraints, implement farmers' and households' rights and respect their production intentions, and abolish some measures that are close to monopolies and blockades; 2. The increase in financial and material input factors must be accompanied by corresponding reforms and development of the input mechanism, otherwise, it will be a low-efficiency accumulation. Currently, the state's investment in several major areas already has this problem and should be given sufficient attention; 3. The input of technological factors must be accompanied by the optimization of the technological system. Over the past decade, although the total amount of material and technological factors has increased significantly, the utilization rate has been low for a long time. This situation is still continuing. Therefore, concerns about China's agricultural development should not focus on changes in resource stocks but should pay more attention to the adjustment and changes of human factors.

　　增加技术投入　挖掘科学潜力
　　北京农业大学部分教授、专家谈我国农业问题
    当前我国农业问题引起各界的关注和议论，近日，北京农业大学的部分专家、教授围绕我国农业的形势，对农业的基本认识及对策等问题展开了讨论。
    石元春（教授、北京农业大学校长）：发达国家的农业趋摆脱“资源农业”的窠臼。现代农业发展有两个主要特点：一是农业技术的大量投入和单位自然资源的高度密集；二是资金和现代物质要素的大量投入。这构成了人类逐渐摆脱资源约束的基本条件。各国农业发展的速度和模式尽管有所不同，但是都要经历从自然农业→资源农业→现代农业的发展过程。这意味着：不同阶段农业发展的要素条件不同；主要依靠土地和劳动力向主要依靠现代物质技术要素的转变是现代农业的基本特征。比较农业研究告诉我们：土地资源的约束不是无法突破的“瓶颈”，依靠科学技术和把中国广大的人力资源转化为人力资本是我国发展农业的现实选择。
    当前国内科技成果向生产转移的运行机制没有很好建立，技术投入环境很差，致使很多很好的技术迟迟不能在生产中发挥作用。问题的关键是如何造成一个良好的政策和市场环境，保障生产者持续的积极性以及强化有效的科技、资金和物资投入。
    刘巽浩（教授、农作研究室主任）：中国农业还是有潜力的。把投入的重点放在提高农田生产力与农民的素质上面，发展中国式的高产增收（益）持久文明的土地集约型农业，搞它５亿亩或１０亿亩这种农田，中国的事情就好办多了。
    刘少伯（教授、畜牧经济室主任）：我国目前仍处于农业技术落后、生产效率很低的状态。以畜牧业为例，转化１公斤肉食消耗的精料（包括粮食、糠麸饼食品）至少８—９公斤，而西欧发达国家不超过５公斤。可见，只要认真进行技术改造，我国尚有相当的潜力。我国人均占有的资源和英国相似，人均耕地１．８亩左右，人均粮食约４００公斤。（英国４２５公斤），而人均肉食产量英国是５６公斤，我国却只有２０公斤，只要依靠科学技术，潜力还是有的。
    的确，由于人口的困难，我国不但将长期保持二元结构，而且还是个高低不同的多层次结构。因此，要随地区差异执行不同的系统政策，发达区进行大规模技术改造，适当发展规模经营，农产品肯定会有明显增长，贫困山区可以考虑分田到户，以私有的方式进行大规模农田改造。只梯田一项，估计将有很大的成效，至少不会拉全国经济发展的后腿。
    毛达如（教授、北京农业大学副校长）：近代科学研究证明在有机肥料的基础上，增加化学肥料的投入，这是实现高投入、高产出的重要农业技术措施。有机肥料可以提高土壤肥力，同样化学肥料也可以提高土壤肥力，二者都可以改善生态环境，提高农作物产量，改进农作物品质。目前国际市场上粮价高涨，化肥跌价（小麦∶化肥＝１．６８∶１价格比例），１吨化肥增产２吨粮食应该是有把握的，因此进口化肥比进口粮食对发展我国农业生产更加有效。与发达国家一样，建立科学施肥咨询服务体系，指导农民科学施肥，实现“优化配方施肥”，以提高肥料效益。
    杨士谋（农业教育研究室主任）：世界农业危机在发达资本主义国家常表现为生产过剩，而社会主义国家常表现为生产短缺。我国理顺对待农业和农民的关系，农业潜力就可进一步发挥。发达资本主义国家农业在国民生产总值中占的比重已经很小，仍实施一系列保护农业和农民的政策，是有道理的。
    郑剑非（教授）：为解决１９８５年以来粮食生产徘徊不前的局面，建议由以下四点促进粮食生产的“开源”，达到逐步稳定运转和递增。
    一、开放市场价格，使农产品价格与生产资料、小生活用品价格趋向合理，使农民种田有利，否则无积极性可言。前提是在征收“田赋”基础上，即将１／１０的全国总产量的公粮保证２亿城市人口，一年７２０亿斤的供应状况下，其它工业、畜牧业、旅游业用粮开放。
    二、扩大经营规模：化小农为大农是当前世界上发展中国家和发达国家的共同经验。形式多样，解决流动、供销、信贷以及生产上的规模。目的是减少中间环节，有利于国家投资和技术推广。
    三、发挥技术效应：农学家普遍公认，“良种”增产１０％，化肥增产１０％，水利增产２０％是没有疑问的。但国家必须拿出一定投资，给以重点支持。
    四、逐步将商品粮县扩大到４００个，以县为单位，以投入换粮食是可行的，一个县拿出５０００万—１亿斤，则商品粮县可提供３００亿斤粮，力争减少进口粮，这具有重大意义。
    李小云（博士、农业发展战略研究室主任）：１０年农村改革取得巨大成就，农业生产水平大增，但农业生产力增长很小，农业生产力未能随产出水平的增长而相应提高。我国农业已进入了一个要求依靠综合投入的阶段。过分强调任何单一的投入要素都无益于农业的发展，目前政策制定的基本点应放在：１、突破观念约束，落实农民和农户的权益和尊重他们的生产意愿，取消近似垄断和封锁的一些措施；２、资金物质投入要素的增加必须伴随投入机制的相应改革和发育，否则将是低效益的叠加，目前国家对几大片的投入已存在这一问题，应引起足够的重视；３、技术要素的投入必须伴随技术体系的优化，近十多年来，虽然物质技术要素总量增加很多，但要素利用率长期低下。这一状况目前仍在持续。因此，对我国农业发展的担忧不应集中在资源存量的变化上，而应更多地注意人为要素的调节和变化。
