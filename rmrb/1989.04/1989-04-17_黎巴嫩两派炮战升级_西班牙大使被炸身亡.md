Reports indicate that yesterday, the Christian and Muslim factions in the Lebanese capital of Beirut engaged in an unprecedentedly fierce artillery battle. A 240mm shell penetrated the basement of the Spanish Embassy in the eastern part of the city. Spanish Ambassador Pedro de Arístegui, who was in the basement, sustained severe injuries and died during emergency treatment at a hospital. Renowned Lebanese poet Awad was also killed in the blast.

According to incomplete statistics, yesterday's fighting resulted in 36 deaths and 153 injuries, making it the deadliest day since the artillery battles began last month. Over the past month, the intensity of the fighting has reached a frenzied level. Efforts by various parties to mediate have been ineffective, and the fighting has only escalated. Both sides have not only targeted government buildings, schools, hospitals, residential areas, and public facilities but have also bombed diplomatic missions protected by international law.

　　黎巴嫩两派炮战升级
　　西班牙大使被炸身亡
    本报大马士革４月１７日电　记者吴文斌报道：据报道，昨天黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特东西区基督教和穆斯林两派又展开了空前激烈的炮战，一发２４０毫米口径的炮弹击穿位于市东区的西班牙大使官邸的地下室。正在地下室的西班牙大使佩德罗·德阿里斯特吉受重伤，在医院抢救时死亡。黎巴嫩著名诗人阿瓦德当场被炸死。
    据不完全统计，在昨天的炮战中有３６人死亡、１５３人受伤，这是自上月初爆发炮战以来，１天内伤亡人数最多的一天。一个月来，双方的炮战已达到了疯狂的程度。有关各方的调解努力均未奏效，而且战火愈燃愈烈，双方不仅轰炸机关、学校、医院、居民区和公共设施，就连受国际法保护的外交使团也成了被轰炸的目标。
