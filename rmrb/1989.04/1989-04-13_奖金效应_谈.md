Title: On the "Bonus Effect"

People often say that when inquiring about a worker's income, one should first ask about the bonus and then about the base salary. This shows the importance of bonuses in people's incomes.

A few years ago, during the rectification of wrongs, the concept of "material incentives" was rehabilitated. However, later on, some people began to overestimate the role of bonuses. Consequently, bonus amounts increased, and the number of people receiving bonuses expanded. Bonuses almost became an additional salary for everyone. But what about the results? In many enterprises, the outcomes are not ideal. The managers' long-awaited surge in workers' enthusiasm has not materialized as expected. Instead, some workers have developed the attitude of "no bonus, no work," leaving managers in a state of bewilderment.

The bonus system is imperfect, and what is labeled as a bonus often turns into a form of "iron rice bowl." Incorrect bonus concepts lead some enterprises and workers to focus on finding ways to "calculate" more money from the state rather than earning bonuses through outstanding performance. These issues undoubtedly affect the effectiveness of the "bonus effect." However, I believe that the lack of stimulated enthusiasm is also due to some enterprises overemphasizing the role of bonus incentives while neglecting other factors.

Here are three examples:

Example one: A young worker was quite lazy, and the enterprise stopped giving him a bonus for a year, but it had no effect on him. One day, he encountered the manager on the street, and the manager greeted him warmly, patting him on the shoulder: "Young man, you've been doing well recently." Surprisingly, this simple gesture worked wonders, and by the end of the year, the young man became an advanced producer.

Example two: A worker who called himself a "hippie" dressed eccentrically and wandered around aimlessly. Later, his suggestion for a technical improvement was adopted by the factory and he was praised at a meeting. From then on, this "hippie" changed his appearance and became a famous innovator in the factory.

Example three: Last year, the appreciation of the yen affected Japan's export trade. Many famous companies reduced their employees' salaries. When asked why they did not go on strike despite the reduced income, a Japanese worker replied to a Chinese reporter: "In the past, the company gave us honor and supported us. Now that the company is facing difficulties, we should also help the company get through this hard time." The reporter was informed that the employees of this company always wore the company emblem when visiting relatives and friends, feeling proud to be employees of the company.

How can this be fully explained by money alone? Human needs are complex. Besides material needs, there are also spiritual needs. In many cases, the two are irreplaceable.

I am not saying that bonuses have no effect. But American psychologist Herzberg's research shows that in enterprise management, there is a category of factors that can only eliminate workers' dissatisfaction but cannot increase their enthusiasm. He believes that health, salary, bonuses, working conditions, and welfare all belong to this category. What can truly stimulate workers' enthusiasm are often a sense of responsibility, a sense of achievement, and pride in the enterprise, and so on.

In today's context, where the "bonus effect" is not ideal, while studying how to improve the bonus system, we also need to seriously consider workers' spiritual needs.

### “奖金效应”谈

　　“奖金效应”谈
　　王清宪
    人常说，如今打听职工的收入，应先问奖金多少，后问工资几何。可见奖金在人们收入中所占的位置了。
    前几年拨乱反正时，给“物质刺激”翻了案，可后来又有点把奖金作用想得太神了。于是乎，奖金数额越发越高，受奖面积越来越大。奖金几乎成了人人一份的“追加工资”。可效益呢？在许多企业里并不理想。厂长企盼已久的职工劳动热情，并没有像预想的那样被“刺激”出来，有的反“刺激”出不给奖金不干活的毛病。这倒让当厂长的哭笑不得。
    奖金制度不完善，名为奖金，实为“大锅饭”。奖金观念不正确，有的企业，有的职工，不是用优秀的成绩去获取奖金。而是专想“算计”国家的办法多拿钱。这些无疑都影响了“奖金效应”的发挥。但我想，“热情没有被刺激出来，恐怕还在于，有的企业过分注重奖金刺激的作用，而忽略了其他。
    这里，不妨讲三个故事：
    例一，某青工较为懒散，企业停发他一年奖金，对他却毫无触动。一天，与厂长街头相遇，厂长主动与他招呼，并亲切地拍拍其肩膀：“小伙子，最近干得不错”。岂料，“一语回春”，年终，小伙子竟当上了先进生产者。
    例二，某职工自称“嬉皮士”，打扮得奇模怪样，整日东游西晃。后来，他的一项技术改造建议被工厂采纳，受到大会表扬。从此，这位“嬉皮士”一改“怪貌”，成了厂里有名的革新能手。
    例三，去年，日元升值，影响了日本企业的出口贸易。许多有名的大公司对职工减薪。收入减少了，你们为什么不罢工？一个日本职工这样回答我国记者的提问：往日，企业给了我们荣誉、养活了我们。如今，企业有了困难，我们也得帮企业渡过难关。记者被告知，该企业职工走亲访友时都不忘佩戴厂徽，能是该企业的职员，他们感到骄傲。
    你说，这怎么能完全用金钱解释得了呢？人的需求是复杂的。除了物质的，还有精神的。二者之间，在许多情况下具有不可替代性。
    我并不是说奖金没有作用。但美国心理学家赫茨伯格研究认为，在企业管理中，有一类因素，只能消除职工的不满，但不能使职工有更高的热情。他认为，保健、工资、奖金、工作条件、福利等，都属于这一类。而能够激发出职工劳动热情的，往往要靠责任感、成就感、企业自豪感，等等。
    在“奖金效应”并不理想的今天，在研究改进奖金制度的同时，我们也需要好好研究职工的精神需求。
