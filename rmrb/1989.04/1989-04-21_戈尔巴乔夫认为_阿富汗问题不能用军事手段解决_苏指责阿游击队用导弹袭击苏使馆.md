Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 20th.

Gorbachev believes that the Afghan problem cannot be solved by military means, and that the Afghan people should independently and autonomously determine their own fate at the negotiating table.

Gorbachev expressed this view in a reply letter to the Chairman of the Pakistani People's National Party, Wali Khan, dated April 15th, which was released by Tass on the 20th.

The Kabul regime led by Najibullah is prepared to engage in dialogue with the opposition to achieve a political solution based on power-sharing and broad cooperation. Currently, the civil war in Afghanistan is still intense, and the situation is tense. The UN Security Council is discussing the Afghan issue. The Soviet Union's publication of Gorbachev's letter to Wali Khan is intended to influence the ruling Pakistani People's National Party.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 20th.

On the morning of the 20th, a surface-to-surface missile fired by Afghan guerrillas fell near the office building of the Soviet Embassy in Kabul, but there were no casualties. At a press conference held that afternoon, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gremitzky condemned this action by the Afghan guerrillas.

    苏指责阿游击队用导弹袭击苏使馆
    新华社莫斯科４月２０日电  苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫认为，阿富汗问题不能用军事手段解决，应让阿富汗人民在谈判桌上独立自主地决定自己的命运。
    戈尔巴乔夫是在４月１５日给巴基斯坦民族人民党主席瓦里·汗的复信中表达这一主张的，塔斯社２０日播发了这封复信。
    以纳吉布拉为首的喀布尔政权准备同反对派对话，在分享权力和建立广泛合作的基础上实现政治解决。目前阿富汗内战依然激烈，形势紧张，联合国安理会正在讨论阿富汗问题。苏联公布戈尔巴乔夫给瓦里·汗的复信是想对执政的巴基斯坦民族人民党施加影响。
    新华社莫斯科４月２０日电　２０日早上阿富汗游击队发射的一枚地对地导弹落在苏联驻喀布尔大使馆办公楼附近，但是没有人员伤亡。苏联外交部新闻发言人格列米茨基赫在当天下午举行的新闻发布会上指责阿富汗游击队的这一行动。
