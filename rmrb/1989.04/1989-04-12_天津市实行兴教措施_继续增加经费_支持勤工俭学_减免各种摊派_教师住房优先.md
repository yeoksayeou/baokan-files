The entire society should do everything possible to care for and support education," Tianjin Mayor Li Ruihuan emphasized at a recent meeting on primary education. He stressed the need to do practical things for education.

The meeting announced that Tianjin will take the following main measures to increase the state and society's investment in education in the near future:

	— Continue to increase financial allocations. Despite the need to tighten spending and control price increases, the actual level of educational funding should increase year by year. This year, it will still account for more than 20% of the city's total financial expenditure.

	— Starting from 1989, the educational surcharge rate for urban areas will be raised from the original 1% to 2%. A rural educational surcharge will be levied on township construction and transportation enterprises, calculated at 1% of the business volume.

	— Select several hundred enterprises and neighborhoods with better performance to partner with 500 urban and town primary schools for targeted support. The support funds can be included in the cost.

	— Carry out diligent work-study activities in primary and secondary schools.

	— Starting from 1989, all kinds of social levies such as cleaning fees, pest control fees, sewer cleaning fees, sewage fees, greening fees, garbage transportation fees, and the "three packages" for the front of the door, will be exempted for schools. Relevant departments are not allowed to reduce the quality of service as a result.

The Tianjin Municipal Government also decided to continue to maintain the 1988 educational system housing allocation indicator, which accounts for 40% of the total number of residential buildings for administrative and public institutions for 5 years or more. For couples where one spouse is a teacher, the spouse's unit can be given priority for housing allocation.

Li Ruihuan also mentioned that this year, Tianjin's 14,000 university graduates who have not been assigned jobs through mutual selection will be retained for arrangement. He said that this is a cost-effective measure for Tianjin. He asked the university students to study hard with peace of mind.

　　天津市实行兴教措施
　　继续增加经费　支持勤工俭学
　　减免各种摊派　教师住房优先
    本报天津4月11日电　记者肖荻报道：“全社会要千方百计关心和支持教育”，天津市长李瑞环日前在市普教会议上强调多为兴教办实事。
    会上宣布，天津近期为增加国家和社会对教育的投入，决定采取下列主要措施：
    ——继续增加财政拨款。在紧缩开支和物价上涨情况下，要使教育经费实际水平逐年增长，今年仍占全市财政支出20％以上。
    ——从1989年起，城市教育费附加计征比例由原来的1％提高到2％。对乡镇建筑、交通企业开征农村教育附加费，按营业额的1％计征。
    ——选择几百家效益较高的企业、街道与500所城镇小学挂钩，实行定点支援。支援费用可摊入成本。
    ——在中小学扎实开展勤工俭学。
    ——从1989年起，举凡清挖费、灭鼠灭蚊费、清理地沟费、排污费、绿化费、垃圾运输费、门前三包费等等社会摊派，对学校一律免收。有关部门不得因此而降低服务质量。
    天津市政府还决定，以1988年教育系统分房指标占全市行政事业单位住宅建设总数40％为基数，继续稳定5年或更长。夫妇双方一方为教师者，其配偶单位可优先分房。
    李瑞环还谈到，天津市今年1.4万大学毕业生凡经双向选择还没分配的，将留下安排。他说，这对天津是个便宜事。他请大学生们安心、努力学习。
