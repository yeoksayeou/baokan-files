Bo Yibo Attends the Discussion of the Shanxi Delegation to the NPC
Rectification is Key to Steady Progress

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 29 (reporter Zhou Xiaonong) - Vice Chairman of the Central Advisory Commission Bo Yibo said on March 29 in the afternoon during the group discussion of the Shanxi delegation that we must summarize experiences, unify understanding, and unify thoughts to seriously carry out rectification and adjustment.

He said, without summarizing experiences, we cannot achieve unity in thoughts and understanding. The general policy of reform and opening up, and invigorating the economy, remains unchanged. However, after 10 years of reform, how have we done? There have been mistakes and errors in some aspects, as Comrade Deng Xiaoping said, old comrades have responsibilities. I also have responsibilities. Therefore, we must continually summarize experiences to achieve complete unity in thoughts and understanding. This is very important at present. This time, the summary of experiences and lessons must not be forgotten.

He said, this session of the Two Meetings has broadly collected opinions and summarized 10 years of experiences. We must think more deeply to summarize even better and do the work better. We should also summarize the experiences of the past 30 years because we are carrying out reform and opening up on the foundation of the past 30 years of construction. Whenever we feel the situation is good, we stir things up, and there is a lot of experience in this regard. Therefore, we should not be too enthusiastic now; if we are too enthusiastic, we should pour some cold water to lower the temperature and seriously carry out the three to four years of adjustment. When talking about the relationship between rectification and adjustment and deepening reform, Bo Yibo said, adjustment itself is deepening. This process should not be estimated too early. Only when rectification is done well can we make steady progress.

　　薄一波参加人大山西代表团讨论
    整顿好才能稳步前进
    据新华社北京电  （记者周晓农）中央顾问委员会副主任薄一波代表３月２９日下午在山西代表团的分组审议会上提出，要总结经验，统一认识，统一思想，认认真真搞好治理整顿。
    他说，不总结经验，就不能做到思想、认识上的统一。改革开放，搞活经济，这一条总的方针是不变的。但是改革１０年了，我们究竟搞得怎么样？有的问题上有错误、有失误，正如邓小平同志所说，老同志有责任。我也有责任。所以要不断地总结经验，以求得思想上、认识上的完全一致。这在目前是非常重要的。这一次的总结经验教训，大家不要忘记了。
    他说，这次两会的召开，广泛收集了意见，总结了１０年的经验。还要好好想一想，以便总结得更深刻一些，把工作搞得更好一些。也要总结过去３０年的经验，因为我们是在过去３０年建设的基础上搞改革开放的。一感到形势好，就折腾一次，这方面的经验丰富得很。所以现在不要热，热了要泼点冷水，把温度降下来，认认真真把这三四年的调整搞好。在谈到治理整顿和深化改革的关系时，薄一波说，调整本身就是深化。这一过程，不要估计过早。整顿好了，才能稳步前进。
