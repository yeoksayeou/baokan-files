	The emergence of the "new theory of the uselessness of reading" in universities is due to misconceptions and inappropriate expectations about the value of knowledge.

	The expectation of knowledge value refers to the hope that knowledge can satisfy human needs. Due to differences in people's understanding of knowledge value and the intrinsic differences in knowledge value, the impact of knowledge value expectations on individuals also varies. Many university students, before reading and studying, first consider the significance and usefulness of this behavior, whether it is worth spending time and effort on. If the acquisition of a certain type of knowledge can satisfy a student's desire and do so appropriately, then they will increase their awareness of learning and be willing to invest time and effort.

	Some students may neglect their studies because they believe that certain knowledge is not valuable and that no matter how much they master, they will not become "rich." They view the economic value of knowledge as the sole criterion for measuring its value and compare knowledge and money in a one-sided and isolated manner, thereby losing the motivation to learn. For university students, if the knowledge they learn cannot bring them significant economic returns in the future, it actually reduces their own "economic value," that is, their ability to earn money. This reduction in self-perceived "economic value" inevitably leads to a loss of interest in learning.

	This is related to the long cycle of education. The knowledge students learn cannot be immediately applied as they expect, but only after internships or entering the workforce. Moreover, even at that time, not all knowledge will have practical value and produce benefits. This is because many university courses are designed to improve students' overall quality, which is essential for their further studies and future work, and cannot be measured in monetary terms. Therefore, it is necessary to help university students establish a correct and scientific view of knowledge value, look to the future, and strive to learn, using their time in school to build a solid foundation.

### 要树立科学的知识价值观

　　要树立科学的知识价值观
    中央教育科学研究所高教室  柯佑祥
    对知识价值的错误认识和失当期望，导致高校“新的读书无用论”的兴起。
    所谓知识价值期望是指人们对知识能够满足人的需要所抱的期望值。由于人们对知识价值认识的不同以及知识价值的内在区别，知识价值期望给人的影响亦是不一致的。许多大学生在看书学习之前，首先考虑的是这种行为的意义、作用，值不值得自己去花费时间及精力。如果某种知识的学习能够满足大学生的某种愿望，并满足得恰到好处，那么，他们就会提高学习知识的自觉性，乐意投入时间及精力。
    有的大学生可能会因为某种知识不值钱，掌握再多也“富”不起来，因而荒废学业。他们把知识的经济价值作为衡量知识价值的唯一指标，把知识与金钱片面、孤立地进行比较，因而丧失学习知识的动力。对大学生来说，由于其所学知识将来不能给他们带来可观的经济收入，实际上也就降低了大学生本人的“经济”价值即挣钱的本领，这种自我“经济价值”的降低必然导致大学生厌学。
    这和教育的周期长有关，学生所学的知识并不能像他们期望的那样，立竿见影，而要到实习或参加工作以后才能得到运用；更何况即使到了那时，也并非所有的知识都具有使用价值，产生效益。因为大学的许多课程是为了提高学生的素质而开设的，这是他们进一步学习、以后工作都不可缺少的，也不是能用金钱来计算的，因此，必须让大学生树立正确的、科学的知识价值观，放眼将来，努力学习，利用在校时间打下坚实基础。
