World Table Tennis Championship Diary

March 31, Sunny
Today, after the team competition entered the second stage, the matches became exciting. From morning to evening, the games were intense. Journalists from various countries stayed in the gym for over ten hours. When hungry, they would go to the fast-food section inside the gym to buy some "hot dogs" (sausages in bread) to fill their stomachs and drink a few cups of beverages provided free by the tournament, then continue their reporting.

During the noon match between the West German men's team and the Chinese team, the cheers and applause from the audience were not very enthusiastic. Perhaps people thought that since they couldn't win the world championship, cheering wouldn't help. However, when the West German team faced the Hungarian team at 6 PM, the gym was like a boiling sea. The audience waved flags and cheered, with waves of cheers making it impossible to talk to someone nearby. Matches on other tables had to be paused multiple times until the audience quieted down a bit before resuming. The West German players seemed invincible, winning the first four games and stunning the Hungarian players who had just defeated the Belgian team in the afternoon. In the end, the West German team defeated the Hungarian team 5:1, eliminating them from the top eight.

The Chinese men's team's evening match against the Belgian team, although won 5:2, made us reporters sweat a bit. The Chinese team's coach had anticipated that the Belgian "dark horse" would be tough to handle. He sent out three veteran players, but each game was tense and hard-fought. Jiang Jialiang lost the first game to Philippe Saive, and in the fourth game, Teng Yi also fell to this young player whom even Xu Shaofa couldn't remember the name of. The rapid improvement of European table tennis is astonishing.

Today, I met a few domestic experts on the stands who were observing the World Table Tennis Championship. They were coaches from provincial and municipal teams or sports schools. I asked them a few questions.

I asked, "The Chinese women's team has had smooth sailing in the previous matches. Is it that the European women are not as strong as imagined?"
They said, "That's not the case. The North Korean women's team is very strong, but they were eliminated by the Hungarian team. European women players are making rapid progress. The Chinese team won a few matches easily, mainly because their main players have different playing styles and are evenly matched. Especially, there is a player, Chen Zihua, who uses a long-pimpled racket. European women players are not adapted to her style."

"Do you think that only players using the pure Chinese fast-attack style can handle the Europeans now?"
The experts said, "It's not good to have too single-minded a style. The North Korean men's team has three main players with three different styles, all at a very high level. They have defeated many strong European teams."

Currently, we lack high-level players who use the shakehand loop drive, chop, or penhold loop drive like Liu Nanqui, the Olympic champion. Relying solely on the penhold fast-attack style is not sustainable.

　　世乒赛日记
    ３月３１日  晴
    今天团体赛进入第二阶段后，比赛顿时精彩起来，从上午到晚上激战一场接一场。各国记者们都是接连十几个小时泡在体育馆里，饿了就到馆内快餐部买点“热狗”（面包夹香肠）之类的东西填填肚子，喝上几杯大会免费提供的饮料，接着继续采访。
    ４月１日　晴
    中午西德男队和中国队比赛时，观众的加油声和掌声还不算太热烈，大概人们觉得反正赢不了世界冠军，喊也没用。等到下午６点西德队和匈牙利队交战时，体育馆里简直像沸腾的大海。观众摇旗呐喊，一浪高过一浪的加油声使人近在咫尺也别想互相说话。其它球台的比赛不得不多次暂停下来，等观众稍安静一点再开始。西德选手也打神了一样，上来就连胜四盘，把白天刚刚胜了比利时队的匈牙利选手打“蒙”了。最后西德队以５∶１把匈牙利队挤出前八名。
    中国男队晚上同比利时队之战虽然以５∶２赢了，可着实令我们这些记者捏了一把汗。中国队教练早料到比利时这匹黑马不好对付，遣出三员老将，仍打得盘盘紧张，分分吃力。江嘉良第一盘就输给了菲利浦·塞维，第四盘滕毅又败在这位连许绍发也说不准名字的小将拍下。欧洲乒乓球运动水平提高之快，令人吃惊。
    ４月２日　多云
    今天在看台上碰到几位观摩世乒赛的国内行家，他们都是省市队或体校的教练。我向他们请教了几个问题。
    我问：“中国女队在前面的比赛中一路顺利，是不是欧洲女将不如想象的那么强？”他们说：“不能这么讲，朝鲜女队实力很强，结果被匈牙利队淘汰了，欧洲女选手进步很快。中国队几场球赢得轻松，主要是几名主力队员打法类型各异，实力平均。特别是有一位怪球手陈子荷。欧洲女队员不适应她那种长胶粒球拍。”
    “你们认为现在只能用清一色的中国式快攻打法的选手对付欧洲人吗？”
    几位行家表示：“打法太单一了也不好。朝鲜男队三名主力三种打法，都达到很高水平，他们战胜了不少欧洲强队。”
    目前我们国内缺少高水平的横拍弧圈手、削球手，也缺少像奥运会冠军刘南奎那样的直拍弧圈快攻手，光靠直拍唱独脚戏是难持久的。
