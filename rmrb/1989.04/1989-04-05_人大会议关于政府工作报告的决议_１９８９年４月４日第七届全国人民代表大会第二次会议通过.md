The Seventh National People's Congress, Second Session, carefully reviewed the government work report titled "Firmly Implementing the Policies of Rectification and Deepening Reform" delivered by Premier Li Peng on behalf of the State Council. The session noted that over the past year, through the joint efforts of all levels of people's governments and the people of all ethnic groups across the country, significant progress has been made in various areas of work. The report truthfully acknowledged the achievements, pointed out the problems and difficulties faced, analyzed the mistakes made in the work, and proposed goals and arrangements for further rectification and deepening of reform. The tasks proposed in the report are arduous but achievable through concerted efforts. The session decided to approve this report.

The session believes that rectification and deepening of reform are at a critical juncture. The State Council and local governments at all levels must fully recognize that rectification work is complex and arduous. They must pay attention to the criticisms and suggestions raised by representatives, further summarize experiences and lessons, and take practical and effective measures to address the issues of concern to the people, such as inflation, prices, agriculture, education, family planning, social order, and clean governance. Efforts must be made to improve the democratic and scientific level of decision-making. Strengthen macro-management, strictly enforce laws, maintain discipline, ensure orders are followed, and overcome the tendency to seek quick results in economic construction, to guarantee the long-term stable and coordinated development of the national economy. While focusing on the material civilization of socialism, efforts must be made to promote the spiritual civilization of socialism, strengthen and improve ideological and political work, and conduct education among citizens on patriotism, collectivism, and socialism. The tradition of hard work and thrift in building the country must be upheld, the national spirit must be invigorated, and the grand cause of socialist modernization must be advanced.

The session believes that the Chinese government's initiative to establish a new international political order based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence is completely correct. China never interferes in the internal affairs of other countries and opposes other countries interfering in China's internal affairs in any way or under any pretext. The pressure exerted by a few foreign parliamentarians on China under the guise of "human rights" is unacceptable to the Chinese people.

The session calls upon all ethnic groups across the country to unite as one, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, to work together with one heart and one mind, to pool their wisdom and strength, to further maintain a stable social environment, and to strive to complete the tasks of rectification and deepening of reform!

　　人大会议关于政府工作报告的决议
    １９８９年４月４日第七届全国人民代表大会第二次会议通过
    第七届全国人民代表大会第二次会议认真审议了李鹏总理代表国务院作的《坚决贯彻治理整顿和深化改革的方针》的政府工作报告。会议认为，一年来经过各级人民政府和全国各族人民的共同努力，全国各项工作取得了新的进展。报告实事求是地肯定了成绩，指出了面临的问题和困难，分析了工作中的失误，提出了进一步治理整顿和深化改革的目标和部署。报告提出的任务是艰巨的，经过努力是可以实现的。会议决定批准这个报告。
    会议认为，治理整顿、深化改革正处于关键时刻。国务院和地方各级人民政府要充分认识治理整顿工作是复杂、繁重的。要重视代表提出的批评和建议，进一步认真总结经验教训，采取切实有效的措施，解决好人民普遍关心的通货膨胀、物价、农业、教育、计划生育、社会治安和廉政建设等问题。要努力提高决策的民主化、科学化水平。加强宏观管理，严格执法，严明纪律，令行禁止，克服在经济建设中急于求成的倾向，保证国民经济的长期稳定协调发展。在抓好社会主义物质文明建设的同时，大力抓好社会主义精神文明建设，加强和改进思想政治工作，在公民中坚持进行爱国主义、集体主义和社会主义教育，发扬艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的光荣传统，振奋民族精神，把社会主义现代化建设的宏伟事业推向前进。
    会议认为，我国政府关于在和平共处五项原则的基础上建立国际政治新秩序的倡议是完全正确的。中国从不干涉别国的内政，也反对其他国家以任何方式和任何借口，干涉我国的内部事务。少数外国议会的议员以所谓“人权”问题对我国施加压力，这是中国人民绝不能接受的。
    会议号召，全国各族人民团结一致，在中国共产党领导下，同心同德，群策群力，进一步维护稳定的社会环境，为完成治理整顿和深化改革的任务而努力奋斗！
