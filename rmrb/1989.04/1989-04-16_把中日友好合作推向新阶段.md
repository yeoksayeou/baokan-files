In April, when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom, Premier Li Peng of the State Council successfully concluded his official friendly visit to Japan at the invitation of the Japanese government. This visit, warmly welcomed by various sectors of Japanese society, has laid a solid foundation for promoting Sino-Japanese friendship and cooperation to a new stage under new conditions.

Since the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan, and especially since the signing of the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between China and Japan, the friendly cooperation between the two countries has made significant progress in various fields, marking that Sino-Japanese relations are becoming mature. Under the new situation, it is the duty of politicians and people of both countries to develop the existing good relations in a healthier and more stable manner. Premier Li Peng's visit to Japan was precisely for this purpose. The visit has consolidated the fundamental principles of Sino-Japanese friendship and cooperation; enhanced the consensus on correctly handling historical issues; broadened exchanges with various sectors of Japanese society, deepening mutual understanding; and explored and opened up new areas for economic cooperation.

The two premiers, through talks, reaffirmed that the Sino-Japanese Joint Communiqué, the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between China and Japan, and the four principles for developing Sino-Japanese relations are the foundation of bilateral relations; developing long-term stable good-neighborly friendship and economic cooperation is the common wish of the peoples of both countries and an important factor for achieving peace and development in the Asia-Pacific region. The achievement of the above consensus not only consolidates the political foundation for developing bilateral relations but also creates favorable conditions for further developing friendly cooperative relations in the future, which is worth celebrating. The current good Sino-Japanese relations are hard-won, the crystallization of the long-term struggle of the pioneers and peoples of both countries, and the result of the joint efforts of the governments of both countries. History has proven that as long as we act in accordance with the principles and spirit of the Joint Communiqué and the Treaty of Peace and Friendship, Sino-Japanese relations will develop smoothly; otherwise, the good relations will be damaged. This is true for handling historical issues and for dealing with real problems in bilateral relations. Premier Li Peng emphasized that correctly handling history is to better open up the future. This proposition has received wide support in Japan.

An important agenda of Premier Li's visit to Japan was to exchange in-depth views with the Japanese government and business circles on issues related to Sino-Japanese economic and technological cooperation. The two countries are at different stages of economic and technological development but have their own advantages. China has advantages in labor and resources, while Japan has advantages in capital and technology. The two complement each other and achieve mutual benefits. Establishing a long-term stable economic relationship on the basis of equality and mutual benefit is in the common interest of both countries. This time, the two sides exchanged the notification of approval of the Sino-Japanese Investment Protection Agreement and reached an agreement on establishing an institution to promote investment in China and holding a technical exchange conference, which will be conducive to further promoting the development of economic and technological cooperation between the two countries.

During the short visit, Premier Li met with various sectors of Japanese society, met old friends, made new friends, visited representatives of overseas Chinese and students in Japan, and answered questions from reporters from various countries. Premier Li introduced to the Japanese people from all walks of life the current economic situation in China and relevant policies for rectification and adjustment, explaining that China's rectification of the economic environment and economic order will create better conditions for reform and opening up, and will not mean any wavering or change in the policy of opening up to the outside world. During the talks and meetings, Premier Li stressed that in international relations, China will continue to pursue an independent and peaceful foreign policy, and developing long-term stable good-neighborly friendship with Japan is a set policy of the Chinese government.

At present, the international situation has undergone a turning point. From confrontation to dialogue, from tension to relaxation. Maintaining peace and seeking development is forming a global trend. China and Japan are both important countries in Asia and important partners in economic cooperation. Strengthening and deepening cooperation in various fields on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence is conducive to making their respective contributions to peace and development in Asia. Sino-Japanese peace and friendly cooperation is the common wish of the peoples of both countries and a grand cause that requires sustained efforts. The task is arduous and the road is long. We are confident that Premier Li Peng's visit to Japan will write an important chapter in the history of Sino-Japanese relations. We wish the peoples of China and Japan to work together to promote Sino-Japanese friendship and cooperation to a new stage.

### 把中日友好合作推向新阶段

　　把中日友好合作推向新阶段
    春深四月，樱花时节。应日本国政府的邀请，国务院总理李鹏对日本进行的正式友好访问，现已圆满结束。这次访问，受到日本朝野各界的热情欢迎，为在新条件下把中日友好合作关系推向一个新阶段打下了基础。
    中日邦交实现正常化、特别是中日和平友好条约缔结以来，两国的友好合作关系在广泛领域都得到显著发展，标志着中日关系正在走向成熟。在新形势下，把业已存在的良好关系更加健康稳定地发展下去，是两国政治家和人民义不容辞的责任。李鹏总理正是以此为目的对日本进行访问的。访问巩固了中日友好合作关系的原则基础；增进了正确对待历史的共识；广泛结交朝野各界朋友，加深了相互理解；探索和开辟了经济合作的新领域。
    两国总理通过会谈再次确认，中日联合声明、中日和平友好条约以及发展中日关系的四项原则，是两国关系的基础；发展长期稳定的睦邻友好和经济上的合作，是两国人民的共同愿望，也是实现亚太地区和平与发展的重要因素。上述共识的取得，不仅巩固了发展两国关系的政治基础，也为今后进一步发展友好合作关系创造了有利条件，这是值得高兴的。目前良好的中日关系来之不易，是两国的先驱者、两国的人民长期奋斗的结晶，也是两国政府共同努力的结果。历史证明，凡是按照联合声明、和平友好条约的原则和精神办事，中日关系就发展顺畅；反之就会使良好的关系受到损伤。对待历史问题是如此，处理两国关系中的现实问题也是如此。李鹏总理强调，正确地对待历史是为了更好地开拓未来。这一主张在日本得到广泛的赞同。
    李总理访日的重要议程之一，是与日本政府及经济界人士就中日经济技术合作问题深入交换意见。中日两国经济技术发展阶段不同，但各有优势。中国有劳动力和资源方面的优势，日本有资金和技术方面的优势。两者合作，互为补充，相得益彰。在平等互利的基础上建立起长期稳定的经济关系，符合两国的共同利益。这次双方交换了中日投资保护协定的批准通知书，还就建立促进对华投资机构和举行技术交流会议达成协议，这将有利于进一步推动两国经济技术合作的发展。
    在短暂的访问期间，李总理面向朝野各界，会见老朋友，广交新朋友，看望了旅日侨胞和留学生代表，回答了各国记者的提问。李总理向日本朝野各界人士介绍了中国当前的经济形势和有关治理整顿的方针政策，说明中国治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序将为改革开放创造更好的条件，而决不意味着对外开放政策有任何的动摇和改变。在会谈会晤时，李总理强调在国际关系方面，中国将一如既往奉行独立自主的和平外交政策，同日本发展长期稳定的睦邻友好关系是中国政府的既定政策。
    目前，国际形势出现了转折性的变化。从对抗转向对话，从紧张走向缓和。维护和平与谋求发展正形成世界性的潮流。中国和日本同为亚洲的重要国家和经济合作的重要伙伴。在和平共处五项原则的基础上加强和深化两国在各个领域的合作，有利于对亚洲的和平与发展作出各自的贡献。中日和平友好合作是两国人民的一致心愿，也是需要持续努力的宏伟事业，任重而道远。我们确信，李鹏总理这次对日本的访问，在中日关系史上将写下重要的一章。愿中日两国人民切实努力，共同把中日友好合作推向新的阶段。
