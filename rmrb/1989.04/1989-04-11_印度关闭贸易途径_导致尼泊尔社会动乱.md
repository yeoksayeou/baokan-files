According to a report from the _Pakistan Times_ today, since late March, India has prohibited third-country goods from transiting through India to enter Nepal. This landlocked country has since faced severe economic difficulties, and in recent days, several anti-government protests have erupted. The government has announced the closure of schools in Kathmandu.

According to reports, the trade and transit agreements between India and Nepal expired at the end of March. The Indian government rejected Nepal's proposal to temporarily extend these two agreements and refused to allow goods from third countries to transit through India into Nepal. This has plunged Nepal, which is severely short of oil, coal, and other supplies, into an economic crisis. Residents have begun to hoard goods, and even fuel for the tourism industry has become scarce.

Since last week, the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu has been in turmoil. Thousands of students demonstrated and marched in front of the palace square. Police used tear gas and electric batons to disperse the protesters. It is reported that the demonstrating students did not receive widespread support, but protests against the king in Nepal are extremely rare. The government ordered the closure of Tribhuvan University and announced a two-week holiday for primary and secondary schools in the capital.

In recent years, Nepal has repeatedly emphasized its independent and autonomous foreign policy and has gradually reduced its dependence on India in foreign trade. In the early 1980s, the two countries' trade accounted for 70% of Nepal's total foreign trade, but this has now decreased to 40%. Nepal is increasingly conducting trade with third countries. Some analysts believe that these factors have led to disagreements between Nepal and India in signing agreements.

### 印度关闭贸易途径　导致尼泊尔社会动乱

　　印度关闭贸易途径
　　导致尼泊尔社会动乱
    本报伊斯兰堡４月１０日电　记者任毓骏报道：据《巴基斯坦时报》今日消息，自３月下旬印度不准第三国货物途经印度进入尼泊尔以来，这个内陆国发生严重经济困难，日前出现了数起反政府示威，政府已宣布关闭加德满都的学校。
    据报道，印度和尼泊尔之间的贸易和过境条约于３月下旬期满后，印度政府拒绝了尼泊尔政府提出的临时延长这两个条约的建议并不准来自第三国的物资途经印度进入尼泊尔。这使严重缺乏石油、煤等物资的尼泊尔陷入经济危机，居民开始抢购商品，连为旅游业提供的汽油都发生困难。
    上周以来，加德满都国立大学发生动乱，数千名学生在王宫前的广场示威游行，警察在驱散示威者时用了催泪弹和电警棍。据报道，示威学生没有得到大众支持，但反对国王的游行在尼泊尔是极为罕见的。政府下令关闭了加德满都国立大学并宣布首都的中小学放假两周。
    尼泊尔近年来多次强调在外交政策上独立自主，在对外贸易上对印度的依赖也逐渐减少。８０年代初，两国的外贸额占到尼泊尔外贸总额的７０％，如今已减少到４０％，尼泊尔越来越多地和第三国成交。有的分析家认为，上述原因致使尼、印两国在签约上发生矛盾。
