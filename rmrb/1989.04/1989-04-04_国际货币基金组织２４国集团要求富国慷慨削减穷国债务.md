The IMF 24-Country Group today issued a statement in Washington, calling on wealthy nations to implement more generous debt reduction plans. They also urged creditor governments to play an active role in resolving the $500 billion debt owed by developing countries to commercial banks.

This statement comes as finance ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) are discussing the U.S. government's "Brady Plan" in Washington. The finance ministers of the 24-Country Group called for comprehensive debt and interest reductions for debt-ridden countries. The statement emphasized that creditor governments, international organizations, and banks are "key factors" in achieving a lasting solution to the debt problem.

According to the "Brady Plan," creditor nations will reduce approximately $70 billion from the $340 billion debt of 39 heavily indebted countries over the next three years. The IMF and the World Bank will provide financial support of $200 billion to $250 billion for this purpose. Local opinions suggest that the 24-Country Group believes the "Brady Plan" has serious flaws because it relies on the "voluntary cooperation" of creditor banks in debt reduction.

　　国际货币基金组织２４国集团要求富国慷慨削减穷国债务
    本报华盛顿４月２日电  记者仓立德报道：国际货币基金组织２４国集团今天在这里发表声明，要求富国实行更慷慨的削减债务计划，并要求债权国政府在解决发展中国家积欠商业银行５０００亿美元的债务问题时“发挥积极作用”。
    这项声明是在西方７国集团财政部长正在这里讨论美国政府提出的“布雷迪计划”时发表的。２４国集团财长在声明中呼吁全面削减债务国的债务和债息。声明说，债权国政府、国际组织和银行是“持久解决债务问题”的“关键因素”。
    根据“布雷迪计划”，债权国将在未来３年中为３９个重债国的３４００亿美元债务减免约７００亿美元；国际货币基金组织及世界银行为此提供２００亿美元至２５０亿美元的财政支持。此间舆论说，２４国集团认为“布雷迪计划”存在严重缺陷，因为在减债中要依赖债权银行的“自愿合作”。
