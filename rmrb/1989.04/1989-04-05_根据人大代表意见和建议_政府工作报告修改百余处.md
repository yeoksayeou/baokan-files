Regarding the strengthening and improvement of the macro-economic control system and the use of economic, administrative, legal, disciplinary, and ideological and political work methods in this process, the revised draft adds "pay attention to maintaining the stability and continuity of policies. Major decisions should be thoroughly discussed and verified in advance, and efforts should be made to improve the democratic and scientific level of decision-making."

Based on the deputies' opinions, the revised draft not only calls for increased investment in education by society as a whole but also adds the following two paragraphs: "The State Council and all levels of government should increase educational funds through increased revenue and expenditure cuts in the execution of the budget as much as possible," and "and strengthen the management and audit supervision of the use of educational funds to prevent embezzlement and waste."

The section with the most additions based on the deputies' opinions and suggestions is the discussion on strengthening spiritual civilization construction. The main additions include: adding "all levels of government must attach great importance to spiritual civilization construction and put this work on the important agenda" and "promote mutual respect, mutual care, and mutual assistance" after "respect the elderly and love the young." After discussing the new situation in reform and opening up, the draft adds: "It is necessary to strengthen and improve ideological and political work in a down-to-earth manner," "insist on conducting education on patriotism, collectivism, and socialism," "conduct education on self-reliance, hard work, carrying forward revolutionary traditions, and enhancing national self-esteem, self-strengthening, and self-confidence," and "cultivate a new generation of socialist people." It also adds "actively publicize the advanced deeds and exemplary figures of 'realizing the Four Modernizations and revitalizing China.'"

The revised draft also adds text to emphasize that "all sectors should support agriculture" and points out the need to "resolutely crack down on illegal business activities that harm agriculture" to ensure the priority supply of energy and raw materials needed for the production of fertilizers, pesticides, and plastic film in various places.

　　根据人大代表意见和建议  政府工作报告修改百余处
    新华社北京４月４日电  今天在七届全国人大二次会议上通过的国务院总理李鹏的政府工作报告，根据代表审议中提出的意见和建议，从内容到文字共作了１２０多处修改。修改后的政府工作报告，对治理整顿、深化改革中的宏观控制问题，对代表们普遍关心的教育事业、精神文明建设、农业发展等问题，作了更加充分的阐述。
    报告修改稿谈到去年对工作指导上的缺点和失误时，在对１９８７年经济形势的估计过于乐观，因此在执行中“行动不坚决”之前，加上了“没有坚持把稳定经济放在首位。”
    在论述治理整顿中必须进一步解决思想认识问题时，修改稿在“坚决维护中共中央的领导权威，坚决维护国务院对政府工作的领导权威”之后，加上了“坚决维护法纪政纪的权威”一句。
    修改稿在涉及国务院的部分，对国务院提出了更严格的要求。稿中谈到“各级政府和各部门，广大干部特别是领导干部，要带头勤俭节约，艰苦奋斗，坚决克服铺张浪费现象”时，在“各级政府”前加上了“从国务院开始”；在强调整顿流通领域，首先必须清理整顿各类公司时，增加了“国务院各有关部门必须带头做好工作”一句。
    关于加强和改善宏观经济调控体系以及在这一过程中运用经济、行政、法律、纪律和思想政治工作等手段，修改稿增加了“注意保持政策的稳定性和连续性。重大决策应事先多方论证，努力提高决策民主化、科学化水平”的表述。
    根据代表们的意见，修改稿除要求增加全社会对教育的投入外，加上了这样两段话：“国务院和各级政府要在执行预算中通过增收节支尽可能增加教育经费”，“并切实加强对教育经费使用的管理和审计监督，杜绝挪用、浪费现象”。
    根据代表所提意见和建议，修改稿增加内容最多的部分是有关加强精神文明建设方面的论述。修改稿增加的主要内容有：加上了“各级政府务必高度重视精神文明建设，把这项工作提到重要的议事日程上来”这样一段话；在“大力提倡相互尊重、相互关心、相互帮助”之后，增加了“敬老爱幼”的字句；在改革开放的新形势下一句之后，增加了这样一段话：“必须切实加强并认真改进”思想政治工作，“坚持进行爱国主义、集体主义、社会主义教育，进行自力更生、艰苦创业、发扬革命传统和增强民族自尊自强自信心的教育，培养社会主义的一代代新人。”还增加了“积极宣传‘实现四化，振兴中华’的先进事迹、先进人物”的字句。
    报告修改稿还增写文字，强调“各行各业都要支援农业”，并指出要“坚决打击坑农、害农的违法经营活动”，以保证各地对化肥、农药、农膜等生产所需的能源、原材料的优先供应。
