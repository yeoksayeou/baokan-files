Advocating for Cadres to Go to the Frontlines of Agriculture and Livestock
— The Call of Some People's Congress Representatives
By Duancunchang, People's Daily Reporter

	“At present, the call to support agriculture is loud, but concrete actions are few.” Many farmer representatives of the People's Congress have offered constructive criticism to the party and government agencies. Upon meeting with People's Congress representative and nationally renowned agricultural labor model Shen Jilan, she immediately said, “Let me say an old thing, perhaps something people don’t like to hear, which is ‘agriculture must go up, cadres must go down.’” She asked me, “Do you think this still has any use?”

	Going to the countryside is a fine traditional working method. Despite changes in the situation, this good practice should not change. Ho Mingguang, a representative of the National People's Congress and the chairman of the Standing Committee of the Jilin Provincial People's Congress, said, “Practice has proven that in places where leading cadres pay attention to going to the countryside and focusing on agriculture, grain and cotton production increases rapidly.” In this province, Gongzhuling City (formerly Huide County) has replaced a new variety of corn every three years over the past decade, reaching a new level, with total grain production increasing from 1 billion kilograms to 3.3 billion kilograms. One of the reasons is that every spring, a large number of cadres and technical personnel are organized to go to the villages and fields to propagate and guide scientific farming to the farmers.

	Many representatives reflected that now many cadres have changed their working style when going to the countryside. The kind of cadres who used to “treat each other warmly and handle things seriously” are rarely seen. Some go to the countryside more to visit rich villages and households and less to visit poor villages and households; some go to the countryside more to visit near places (suburban areas near cities, along railways) and less to visit far places (remote mountainous areas); some prefer to go to enterprises and do not want to stay in the fields or pastures. “Going to the countryside by car is a breeze, eating and drinking in groups,” “full of spirit in the morning, drunk at night.” In some places, the “poverty alleviation teams” sent have turned into “bottle support teams” (always supporting the wine bottle), and the masses curse them as “little locusts.”

	Farmers like cadres with good working styles who go to the countryside. They suggest rectifying the work of sending cadres to the countryside and establishing a new system for cadres to go to the countryside. People's Congress representative, Li Donghui, secretary of the Alatai Regional Committee of Xinjiang, said, “I am in charge of jade (jewelry processing), but I do not forget the granaries (fields) and eggs (livestock). Cadres going to the countryside focus on investigations and research, implementing face-to-face leadership.” The party organization sent this young cadre to work in the border areas of China and the Soviet Union, China and Mongolia for four years. He led the regional and prefectural-level leading cadres to spend one-third or one-fourth of their time each year working on the frontlines of agricultural and livestock production, and signed target responsibility books at all levels, using actual performance to assess cadres. They insisted on holding two on-site meetings that do not violate the agricultural season each year, listening to reports county by county, inspecting work, and helping to solve practical difficulties and problems. Li Donghui said, “Our cadres at all levels go to the frontlines of agricultural and livestock production, and each year we must ensure that this article is well written.” In the past four years, the agriculture and livestock industry in the Alatai Region has shown new vitality.

　　提倡干部到农牧业第一线
    ——部分人大代表的呼声
    本报记者  段存章
    “眼下的情况是，叫喊支援农业的呼声挺高，但实实在在的行动较少。”许多人大农民代表向党政机关提出中肯批评。记者与人大代表、全国著名农业劳动模范申纪兰一见面，她就说：“我说句老话，也可能是人们不喜欢听的话，就是‘农业要上去，干部要下去’。”她反问我：“你说这话还有没有用？”
    干部下乡是一种优良的传统工作方法。形势变化，这个好作风不能变。全国人大代表、吉林省人大常委会主任霍明光说：“实践证明，哪个地方的领导干部重视下乡抓农业，哪里的粮棉产量就上得快。”这个省的公主岭市（原怀德县）近十年每隔三年更换一个玉米优良品种，上一个新台阶，粮食总产从１０亿公斤增加到３３亿公斤。原因之一就是每年春天组织大批干部和科技人员到村下田向农民宣传、指导科学种田的结果。
    许多代表反映，现在不少干部下乡作风走样了。过去那种“亲亲热热相处，认认真真办事”的干部少见了。有的下乡跑富村富户多，到穷村贫户少；有的下乡走近（城镇郊区、铁路沿线）不走远（偏僻山区）；有的爱上企业转，不愿到田头牧场蹲。“下乡坐车一溜风，吃吃喝喝一群群”、“早上抖精神，晚上醉醺醺”。有的地方派去的“扶贫队”变成了“扶瓶队”（天天扶酒瓶），群众骂之为：“小蝗虫”。
    农民喜欢作风好的下乡干部。他们建议对派干部下乡的工作进行整顿，建立新的干部下乡制度。人大代表、新疆阿勒泰地委书记李东辉说：“我是抓金豆豆（宝石加工），不忘粮囤囤（农田）、肉蛋蛋（牧业），干部下乡重调查研究，实行面对面领导。”党组织派这位年轻干部到中苏、中蒙边境的贫困地区工作已４个年头，他带领地委、专署领导干部每年有１／３或１／４的时间到农牧业生产第一线工作，并层层签订目标责任书，以实绩考核干部。他们坚持一年两次不违农时的现场办公，一个县一个县听汇报，检查工作，帮助解决实际困难和问题。李东辉说：“我们各级干部到农牧业生产第一线去，每年要保证做好这篇文章。”近４年，阿勒泰地区的农牧业有了新的生机。
