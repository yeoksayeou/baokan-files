After reading the "Today's Talk" article "Questioning the Big Character Poster" on March 29, I felt that it raised an important issue that warrants further discussion.

During the ten-year catastrophe, the harm caused by big character posters is well-known and needs no further elaboration. In light of this, the Third Session of the Fifth National People's Congress in 1980 passed a resolution to remove the provision in the original Constitution's Article 45, which stated that citizens have the right to use "big debates, big character posters, big speeches, and big discussions." The resolution pointed out that this action was taken "to fully promote socialist democracy, improve socialist legal systems, maintain a stable and united political situation, and ensure the smooth progress of socialist modernization construction."

From the perspective of the National People's Congress resolution, the removal of the provision granting citizens the right to use big character posters is a universal statement, not a specific one. In other words, it aims to eliminate the form of big character posters itself, regardless of their content. Therefore, the Constitution no longer guarantees citizens the right to post big character posters unconditionally; it is not conditional. In my personal opinion, the article "Questioning the Big Character Poster" did not clearly explain this point.

From 1980 to the present, the National People's Congress has passed many laws to protect citizens' rights. The recently concluded Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress passed the "Administrative Litigation Law," which is a recent example. The Thirteenth Party Congress proposed to establish a social consultation and dialogue system, stating that "the demands and voices of the masses must have channels to be regularly and smoothly reflected, suggestions must have places to be made, and grievances must have places to be voiced." The current issue is: on one hand, we need to continue to make the legal system more complete, and on the other hand, we need to ensure that existing laws and correct policies are truly implemented in various places, departments, and units.

As mentioned in the article "Questioning the Big Character Poster," the reasonable opinions and demands raised by the masses should have been reflected and properly resolved through normal democratic channels long ago. Leaders should proactively establish such mechanisms to help identify and overcome their own bureaucratic or authoritarian tendencies, rather than standing in opposition to the masses. They should not resort to accusations or arbitrary charges.

### 对《“大字报”质疑》的补正

　　对《“大字报”质疑》的补正
    读了３月２９日“今日谈”《“大字报”质疑》，感到它提出了一个很重要的问题，有进一步探讨的必要。
    十年浩劫中大字报为害之烈无需赘言。有鉴于此，１９８０年五届人大三次会议作出决议，取消原宪法第４５条中公民“有运用‘大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报’的权利”的规定，指出这样做是“为了充分发扬社会主义民主，健全社会主义法制，维护安定团结的政治局面，保障社会主义现代化建设的顺利进行。”
    从全国人大的决议看，取消公民有运用大字报的权利的规定是全称的而不是特称的，也就是说，它所要取消的是大字报这种形式本身，而不问其内容如何。所以，宪法不再保障公民贴大字报的权利是无条件的，不是有条件的。我个人认为，《“大字报”质疑》一文对这一点阐述得不够清楚。
    从１９８０年到现在，全国人大已经通过了许多项保障公民权利的法律，刚闭幕不久的七届人大二次会议通过的《行政诉讼法》就是一个最近的例子。党的十三大则提出，要建立社会协商对话制度，“群众的要求和呼声，必须有渠道经常地顺畅地反映上来，建议有地方提，委屈有地方说。”现在的问题是：一方面要继续使法制更完备，另一方面要使已有的法律和正确的政策在各地方、各部门、各单位真正落到实处。
    像《“大字报”质疑》一文所举的两个例子，群众所提的正当意见和合理要求，早就应该通过正常的民主渠道得到反映，取得妥善的解决。领导者应该主动建立这样的机制，以有助于发现和克服自身的官僚主义或专断作风，而不应站到群众的对立面，更不应动辄兴师问罪，乱扣帽子。
