Kim Il-sung Returns a Visit to Zhao Ziyang

Both Sides Engage in Cordial and Friendly Conversation

Pyeongyang, April 26 (Xinhua) — Kim Il-sung, General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea Central Committee, paid a return visit to Zhao Ziyang, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, at the Paekhwa Garden State Guesthouse this morning. Both sides engaged in cordial and friendly conversation.

At 9:20 AM, Zhao Ziyang and his entourage went to the guesthouse entrance hall to welcome Kim Il-sung. After both leaders took their seats, Kim Il-sung inquired, "Are you getting used to living here? There is only a one-hour time difference between our countries." Zhao Ziyang replied, "There is no time difference now. China started implementing daylight saving time on April 16, so the time in Pyeongyang and Beijing is the same." Kim Il-sung smiled and said, "That's why I like to go to China, because there is no time difference. Going to Europe is too inconvenient because of the time difference."

Zhao Ziyang excitedly told Kim Il-sung, "Last night we watched a very good performance. The artistic level of this show is very high. I heard that it was personally overseen by Comrade Kim Jong-il. The cultural work in Korea is very good. Our cultural workers often go to Korea and have left deep impressions."

Zhao Ziyang also told Kim Il-sung, "China will soon send a 300-person delegation to participate in the 13th World Youth Festival in Pyeongyang, including 100 cultural workers."

During the meeting, both leaders conversed warmly, like family, in a lively and sincere manner.

Today, other Korean leaders who visited the Paekhwa Garden State Guesthouse to return Zhao Ziyang's visit included Yon Hyong-muk, Choe Hyon, and others.

From the Chinese side, participants included Wu Xueqian, Hong Xuezhi, and others.

　　金日成回拜赵紫阳    
    双方进行亲切友好交谈
    本报平壤４月２６日电  记者徐宝康报道：朝鲜劳动党中央委员会总书记金日成今天上午前往百花园国宾馆，回拜中共中央总书记赵紫阳，双方进行了亲切友好的交谈。
    上午９时２０分，赵紫阳一行到宾馆门口大厅迎候金日成同志。两位领导人坐定后，金日成同志关心地问：“在这里生活习惯吧？我们朝鲜同北京只有１个小时的时差。”赵紫阳回答说：“现在没有时差了，中国４月１６日开始实行了夏时制，所以平壤和北京的时间是一样的。”金日成笑着说：“所以我喜欢到中国去，因为没有时差，到欧洲去时差太大不习惯。”
    赵紫阳兴奋地告诉金日成：“昨天晚上我们看了一个非常好的演出。这台节目艺术水平很高，听说这是金正日书记同志亲自抓的。朝鲜的文艺工作做得很好。我国文艺工作者经常到朝鲜，留下了深刻印象。”
    赵紫阳还对金日成说：“中国不久以后将派一个３００人的代表团参加在平壤举行的第１３届世界青年联欢节，其中１００人是文艺工作者。”
    席间，双方领导人亲切交谈，就像一家人一样，热烈、真挚、兴致勃勃。　
    今天前往百花园国宾馆回拜赵紫阳总书记的朝鲜领导人还有延亨默、许锬等。
    中国方面参加的有吴学谦、洪学智等。
