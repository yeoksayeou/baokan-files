Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, April 19th.

Two foreign experts working at the An Taibao Coal Mine, a joint venture between China and the United States, have recently been named as model workers in the Shanxi coal industry, attracting widespread attention.

Don Slaughter from the United States came to the Pingluo Coal Mine's An Taibao Mine in July 1986. As the manager of the electrical division, he has spared no effort to reduce costs and actively promoted the use of Chinese components to replace imported parts, saving the mine over 20 million yuan last year. Ted South from Canada is a senior mining engineer who has been working as the chief engineer of the engineering department at An Taibao Mine since November 1985. Over the years, his department has set several national records in areas such as geological exploration and surveying.

    唐·斯路特于１９８６年７月来到平朔煤矿安太堡矿工作。他在担任电气分部经理时，千方百计降低成本，积极利用中国元件代替进口配件，去年为矿上节约资金２００多万元。特德·南是采矿高级工程师，１９８５年１１月到安太堡矿任工程部主任工程师。几年里，他所在的工程部在地勘、测量等方面创出了几项国内先进纪录。
