Title: The Difficulty of Purchasing Educational Supplies

Edition: 5

In recent years, the market has been short of educational supplies, making them very difficult to purchase. Last semester, our school lacked sufficient mathematical tools such as compasses and triangles. We sent staff to Shaoxing City three times to buy them, but after searching the entire city and inquiring at every large and small stationery store and department store, we found none. It was truly a case of "searching in vain." In the end, a few teachers had to take turns using a single compass and triangle for classes. This not only caused inconvenience but also sometimes disrupted the normal teaching process, affecting the quality of education.

This semester, after the start of school, we went to Shaoxing City again to purchase supplies, but we still did not succeed. Not only these few items, but other supplies also frequently fall short. To improve the nine-year compulsory education system and enhance the quality of teaching, we earnestly hope that the relevant departments and stores will consider the next generation and do something practical for education by providing the necessary teaching supplies, making teaching more convenient.

### 购买教学用具何其难

　　购买教学用具何其难
    近年来，市场上教具紧缺，非常难买。上学期，我们学校圆规、三角板等数学教具不够用，三次派员到绍兴城里购买，可是跑遍整个绍兴城，问遍大小文具店和百货商店，均无货。真是“踏破铁鞋无觅处”啊！无奈，我们几个教师只好轮流共用一副圆规、三角板上课。这样，不仅不方便，而且有时还打乱了正常的教学程序，影响了教学。
    本学期开学后，我们再次赶到绍兴城里购买教具，但仍未能如愿。不仅这几种教具，其它一些教具也常常出现短缺。为了搞好九年制义务教育，提高教学质量，我们恳切希望有关部门和商店能为下一代着想，为教育办些实事，提供必要的教学用具，给教学以方便。
