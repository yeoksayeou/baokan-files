Government Officials Dialogue with Capital University Students

Discussions on Combating "Official Corruption," Company Cleanup, Integrity Building, Educational Development, News Reporting, and Student Strikes and Protests

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 29th - At the request of the State Council and Premier Li Peng, State Council Spokesperson Yuan Mu and Vice Minister of the State Education Commission He Dongchang, Beijing Municipal Party Committee Standing Committee Member and Secretary-General Yuan Liben, and Beijing Municipal Vice Mayor Lu Yucheng held an open and candid dialogue with 45 students from 16 universities in Beijing this afternoon at the China Youth League Central Committee meeting room.

This dialogue was organized by the All-China Students' Federation and the Beijing Municipal Students' Federation.

During the dialogue, participants exchanged views on combating "official corruption," company cleanup, integrity building, educational development, news reporting, and student strikes and protests.

Students' hopes align with the government's aspirations

At the beginning of the dialogue, Yuan Mu first conveyed the messages from the Party and state leaders to the students present, and through them to the broader student body: hoping that students can return to classes as soon as possible. If students have any opinions on national affairs or social issues, they can raise them through normal channels.

Yuan Mu said: Premier Li Peng also specifically asked me to convey to everyone and to the broad student body of Beijing's universities that the editorial in People's Daily, which mentioned the political struggle against denying the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system, was directed at the illegal actions of a very few individuals, not at the broad student body. The broad student body, with their patriotic fervor, hopes to promote democratization, deepen reforms, combat corruption, and overcome vices. These hopes are completely consistent with the government's aspirations. The Party and state leaders hope that students can fully recognize their social responsibilities. Our youth are the future and hope of the motherland. Our youth, especially university students, must recognize their social responsibilities, engage in calm and rational thinking, maintain social stability, and support the Party and government in their rectification and rectification efforts to overcome current difficulties.

Yuan Mu pointed out that our country is currently facing many difficulties. If there is chaos and instability, these difficulties will be even harder to overcome. We hope that students and all sectors of society will work together to support the Party and government, adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, and persist in reform and opening up, to carry out the socialist modernization cause to the end and achieve the expected victory.

Combating "official corruption" requires exposure and institutional reform

A student from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics said that the students' slogan "Official corruption, official corruption, won't be stopped until beaten down" reflects the serious corruption that exists. Students are frustrated because the central government's measures to combat official corruption are always loud thunder but little rain. People hope to see the results of the crackdown.

Yuan Mu said that the students' feelings are understandable. I personally detest "official corruption." But using the method of "beating down" may not achieve the desired results. To solve the problem of "official corruption," we mainly rely on two approaches: one is exposure. Whoever has information on this matter, we welcome them to report it to the reporting center. Another point is institutional building, such as the "two opennesses and one supervision" system that is being promoted.

Yuan Mu provided some figures: In 1988, the national courts at all levels handled 313,306 criminal cases, including 55,180 cases of economic crimes involving "official corruption." Of these, 55,170 cases were concluded, and 74,923 people were sentenced. Currently, there are 2,784 procuratorates that have established reporting centers, and 158 large and medium-sized cities have established reporting centers. In the second half of 1988 alone, more than 147,000 reports were received, including more than 52,000 cases of bribery and embezzlement, with more than 5,700 cases investigated and more than 1,500 cases involving amounts over 100,000 yuan. According to recent materials from the Supervision Department, in the past year, supervision agencies have received 77,297 reports from units and individuals, with 25,255 cases investigated and 17,757 cases concluded. Direct or recommended administrative penalties were given to 12,699 people, including 432 at the county level or above; 1,187 were recommended for disciplinary action; and 1,571 were transferred to judicial authorities for handling.

Yuan Mu said that I am not saying that the work of investigating and punishing "official corruption" and other cases of bribery and embezzlement has achieved great results. I just want to point out that the Party and government are sincerely investigating and punishing "official corruption" and bribery and embezzlement, and are determined to overcome corruption. But without investigation, using a simple "beat down" method may lead to results we do not want to see. I once again, on behalf of the State Council, welcome reports from all sectors of society, including young students, on "official corruption" and other issues.

A student from Beijing Institute of Technology asked: Is the emergence of "official corruption" in China a necessary phenomenon of socialist reform, or is it due to mistakes in the decisions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council? Yuan Mu replied, "The emergence of 'official corruption' has economic, political, and social causes. Economically, our productive forces are still not developed, still in the initial stage of commodity economy, and the market is not well-developed, resulting in some chaotic phenomena; politically, our goal is to build socialist democratic politics, but currently we lack necessary legal systems and necessary checks and balances, with phenomena of power-for-money and money-for-power exchanges still serious in some places and departments; ideologically, there are still influences of feudalism and capitalist decadent thoughts. In addition, mistakes in government decision-making are also a factor. To solve these problems, we need to continuously improve institutions, and the state's decision-making must be more scientific and democratic. A few protests and demonstrations cannot solve the problem.

A student from Beijing Medical University asked: Who do you think is the biggest "official corruptor" in China? What has been the effect of rectification and rectification?

Yuan Mu replied, I cannot name names here about who is the biggest "official corruptor." I can tell you that the Audit Office has sent working groups to audit companies such as Kanghua, CITIC, Guangda, and Agricultural Investment for a considerable period of time. The preliminary audit results have come out, and it has been decided to publish the audit results after the situation is verified. Premier Li Peng also clearly stated in the government work report that various places and departments should publish the results of the company rectification in various forms, including newspaper publications, to accept public supervision and prevent formalism.

Adjusting the educational layout

A student from Beijing Normal University asked: Many students have raised educational issues. What measures are there to emphasize education? When will they be implemented?

He Dongchang said, Last year, the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee decided to establish an education leadership group, and this year, it is planned to hold the first central plenary session dedicated to discussing educational issues since the founding of the nation. The biggest mistake in the past ten years is in the field of education, including ideological and moral education and spiritual civilization education. Here, there are both factors of social environment and some mistakes that have emerged in the reform. I think that the mistakes in education are mistakes in the layout of socialist modernization construction. We need to adjust the layout, including adjusting the financial input structure and improving teachers' treatment. First, all Party comrades must re-recognize the importance of the education issue. Improving the treatment of intellectuals requires money, and Beijing's education funding investment this year accounts for 20% of the city's total financial investment, an increase from last year. Nationwide, a new tax should be established to improve education, so that people's education is run by the people.

Lu Yucheng said, Caring about education is caring about the quality of the nation and the future of the country. Beijing's financial investment in education has been increasing every year, and the construction of the primary and secondary school teacher team is a major task in education, because education is based on teachers. To attract and mobilize more students to study education, we will create some conditions.

Yuan Mu said, This year, the state's financial revenue and expenditure are quite tight and difficult, but the educational funds allocated by the state are still increasing from more than 32 billion yuan last year to more than 37 billion yuan, an increase of 5 billion yuan, with a growth rate of 15.4%. The low treatment of intellectuals is a mistake in our work, and the State Council has recognized this mistake and is taking steps to solve this problem.

A student from the Central University for Nationalities asked: I am a Communist Party member. I feel that there has been no explanation for Hu Yaobang's resignation. Since it is said that Hu Yaobang has made significant contributions to the reform, then why did he have to resign? Is the democratic life within the Party normal?

Yuan Mu said, This is an internal Party matter, and as a State Council official, I am not in a position to answer this question. But as a Party member, I am willing to share my views. Hu Yaobang is a great proletarian revolutionary and statesman. He has devoted his life to the cause of socialism and communism, and the Party Central Committee has given him a very high evaluation. Hu Yaobang proposed to resign in early 1987, and he made self-criticisms about his shortcomings during that period of work. He felt that he was not suitable for the position of General Secretary and voluntarily proposed to resign, which was approved by the enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee at that time and later by the plenary session of the Central Committee.

There is no news censorship system in the country

A student from Beijing Foreign Studies University said that requiring the media to tell the truth is one of the students' strongest demands. We demand that news reports be comprehensive, true, and timely. If the media is not free, there is no way to talk about democratic construction. The news censorship system should be abolished.

Yuan Mu said, News reporting should be objective and true. The relevant departments of the State Council are currently drafting the News Law and the Publication Law, and if the work progresses smoothly, there may be a draft this year to be submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation. I am a journalist by profession. As far as I know, there is no news censorship system in the country, and the news reporting work implements the system of the chief editor of the newspaper being responsible. Sometimes when they feel that some reports are difficult to handle, they often send the manuscript to the relevant departments for review and verification. The issue of newspaper bans refers to the news censorship system of the old society. Sometimes, when the censorship officials do not allow the publication of some news reports, and the substitute manuscript cannot be typeset in time, the phenomenon of "opening a window" in the newspaper will occur. This phenomenon no longer exists.

He Dongchang said, News is not absolutely free and is also subject to legal constraints, and must bear necessary social responsibilities. Every line and every article in the newspaper must be responsible to the readers.

Yuan Mu added, According to the Constitution, news reporting enjoys freedom, but is also subject to the constraints of the Constitution and laws. Because reporting bears social responsibilities, it must be responsible to the broad readership and cannot report whatever it wants, which is the case in any country.

Students and police should understand each other

Students from China University of Political Science and Law and other schools raised the issue that during the student march and sit-in on April 20, there were incidents of police beating students.

Yuan Liben said, On April 20, I was at the scene of Xinhuamen. I saw someone throwing soda bottles at the armed police from behind. After the march, there were many soda bottle fragments in front of Xinhuamen. There were rumors that the police were carrying batons and kicking students with big shoes. There were no police carrying batons or wearing big shoes. The relevant departments have stipulated that armed police on duty must wear belts and rubber shoes, and some public security officers wear leather shoes, but there are no big shoes. If someone sees the police carrying batons, please point them out. The relevant departments frequently educate the armed police and public security personnel on civilized law enforcement and strict discipline, and do not allow beating people. Of course, some armed police and public security personnel are young, and it is not possible to guarantee that none of the hundreds or thousands of armed police and public security personnel will make any mistakes. Public security officers have also been beaten, and I hope everyone can understand each other. If there are armed police or public security personnel with excessive behavior, beating people, and there is evidence, they will be dealt with according to law. We have already made regulations that if students report that armed police or public security personnel have beaten people, the armed police unit or public security department will send people to the school to find them, verify the situation, and deal with it.

As long as it does not violate the law, it will not be pursued

A student from Beijing Forestry University raised the issue that during the two student marches on April 21 and April 27, tens of thousands of Beijing citizens welcomed them, some threw money and cigarettes to the university students, and some shouted, "Long live the university students!" The students' patriotic movement is the will of the people.

Yuan Mu said, Most students are full of enthusiasm, demanding to promote reform and oppose corruption, and their aspirations are completely consistent with the work goals of the Party and government.

He Dongchang continued, During the march, the students shouted slogans supporting the Communist Party, supporting socialism, supporting the Constitution, and supporting the Four Cardinal Principles. If someone in the crowd proposed to oppose the Four Cardinal Principles, there would not be so many students participating. Who is happy about the turmoil? Some people with ulterior motives are happy, and some right-wing forces in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the United States are happy. Beijing University even received a letter of support from the reactionary organization Chinese League in the United States.

Yuan Mu hopes that while maintaining their enthusiasm, students should be more rational and calm.

Yuan Liben said, Beijing has a population of 10 million, with nearly 2 million floating population. On the day of the student march on the 27th, 300,000 people in Beijing could not take public transportation, many people could not get milk, and many people could not exchange gas cylinders. This point has been reported in today's Beijing Daily. The march caused serious traffic congestion and affected production.

Yuan Liben said, It is now found that some people are organizing in middle schools. University students have a side of enthusiasm, but also a side of rationality. However, once middle school students get out of control, the situation will be difficult to control. I hope not to organize in middle schools. Regarding the issue of marches, students can conduct a survey. Many countries have laws on marches, specifying where to march, how to organize, and even which slogans cannot be shouted. In some countries, if the march regulations are violated, they will be punished, and the use of batons and police equipment is not to be mentioned.

A student from Beijing University of Science and Technology asked, why was the military used to block the student march?

Yuan Liben replied, Our ten conditions for marches are for the maintenance of social order and the interests of the people. Unauthorized marches violate these regulations, so we do not support marches. Beijing's police are not many, and during student marches, they also have to prevent bad people from taking advantage of the situation to cause trouble. To protect the commercial areas of Wangfujing and Dazhalan, a lot of manpower has been dispersed. This is from a comprehensive consideration.

A student from Beijing Normal University asked: Since the very few people are separated from the broad student body, how will the central government evaluate the student movement, and how will the organizers of the movement be dealt with?

He Dongchang replied, As long as it does not violate national laws and regulations, whether it is students, teachers, or anyone else, even if they have said some inappropriate words or done some inappropriate things, they will not be held responsible. Yuan Mu expressed his complete agreement with Comrade He Dongchang's opinion and said that he would convey this opinion to the relevant departments of the State Council.

We must have a basic assessment of the Party

A student from Tsinghua University asked: Many students reflect that the Party's style is not upright and corruption is serious. According to someone's "relationship chart," some officials' children have obtained high positions through nepotism. How can these problems be solved institutionally?

Yuan Mu said, Regarding the Party's style, there are indeed many problems now. But I want to say one thing, we must have a basic assessment of our Party. We must admit that in recent years, the problem of the Party's style has indeed become more serious, which is a fact. But from an overall perspective, our Party is still good. Students also held up the slogan "Support the Communist Party," right? If this Party were completely corrupt and degenerate, not only would students not support it, I would not support it either.

He said, In the past 10 years, the Party and government have adhered to "one center, two basic points," and the basic line, principles, and policies are correct. No matter what, in these 10 years, our country has undergone historic changes, which is a fact that no one can deny. But due to historical and political reasons, including our lack of resolute opposition to bourgeois liberalization and the negative impact of opening up to the outside world, it has brought about quite serious problems of the Party's style not being upright. However, the Party has the resolve and confidence to overcome these problems.

Yuan Mu said, As for the "relationship chart," this needs to be analyzed. Some people say that young and middle-aged leaders with the same surname as the leaders are the leaders' sons, and those with different surnames are sons-in-law, which is completely inconsistent with the facts in some cases and has large discrepancies in others. In short, I do not approve of the practice of drawing "relationship charts" like the "Hundred Clowns" during the Cultural Revolution, which has a bad social effect and is not conducive to stability and unity.

A student from Beijing University of Technology asked: The central government proposes to tighten our belts for a few years, and leaders should share the same hardships with the masses. But some leaders play golf with their wives once a week.

Yuan Mu said, I am not aware of this situation. I can convey your opinion. The report on the work of the government at the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress has clearly stated that the central state organs and government organs at all levels should take the lead in tightening our belts for a few years. Here, I can tell you that the central government has decided that starting from this year, it will no longer go to Beidaihe for summer work. Because this will increase financial expenditures and cause traffic congestion, which is not in line with the requirement of tightening our belts for a few years.

He said, The central government has also decided that starting from now, the state will no longer import luxury cars.

A student from North China University of Technology said, The central government says that no matter who it is, if there is corruption, it will be investigated and dealt with. If there is, please publicize the facts.

Yuan Mu said, I can fully assure you that if there is corruption in the leading organs of the central and local governments, regardless of the level of the cadres, it will definitely be seriously investigated and dealt with. But asking me to publicize the facts now is difficult, not only because I do not know all the details, but also because my words must be legally responsible. Because many problems need to go through a certain legal procedure. I hope everyone can understand this.

The form of dialogue can be diverse and multi-level, but it does not include illegally established organizations

Some students suggested that the dialogue should be conducted with representatives elected by the students who can represent the students, and they hope to have a direct dialogue with high-level Party and state leaders.

Yuan Mu said, I think the form of dialogue can be diverse and multi-level. Dialogue is not a negotiation between opponents. There is no negotiation between the government and students, but rather a conversation to exchange thoughts and increase understanding. As long as everyone has good intentions and is willing to sit down and talk, there should be no preconditions.

When a student from China University of Political Science and Law suggested that the government should have a dialogue with the "Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation," Yuan Mu and He Dongchang clearly stated that they were invited by the All-China Students' Federation and the Beijing Municipal Students' Federation to have a dialogue with the students. We do not recognize illegal student organizations that have not been recognized.

The dialogue lasted nearly three hours. The responsible person from the All-China Students' Federation, who chaired the dialogue, said that the atmosphere of today's dialogue was very good, and in the future, they are willing to continue to organize such dialogues.

　　政府部门负责人同首都高校学生对话    
    就惩治“官倒”、清理公司、廉政建设、发展教育、新闻报道和学生罢课、游行等问题交换意见
    新华社北京４月２９日电（记者何平、张宝瑞）受国务院和李鹏总理的委托，国务院发言人袁木和国家教委副主任何东昌，北京市委常委、秘书长袁立本，北京市副市长陆宇澄，今天下午在团中央会议室同北京１６所高校的４５名学生进行了坦诚的座谈、对话。
    这次座谈、对话是由全国学联和北京市学联主持召开的。
    在对话中，大家就惩治“官倒”、清理公司、廉政建设、发展教育、新闻报道和学生罢课、游行等问题交换了意见。
    广大同学的一些希望同政府的愿望是一致的
    座谈、对话开始时，袁木首先告诉在座的同学，党和国家的领导同志托他给大家，并通过大家向广大同学捎几句话：希望广大同学能够尽快复课。如果大家对国家事务，对社会问题有什么意见，可以通过正常渠道提出来。
    袁木说：李鹏总理还特别让我告诉大家并转告北京高校的广大同学，《人民日报》社论当中讲到的关于否定中国共产党的领导，否定社会主义制度的政治斗争的问题，是针对极少数人的违法行为说的，并不是针对广大同学的。广大同学怀着满腔爱国热情，希望推动民主化进程，深化改革，惩治贪污，克服腐败，这些希望，同政府的愿望是完全一致的。党和国家的领导同志希望同学们充分认识到自己肩负的社会责任。我们的青年是祖国的未来和希望。我们的青年，特别是大学生，要认识自己的社会责任，经过冷静的、理智的思考，维护社会稳定，支持党和政府进行治理整顿，渡过眼前的困难。
    袁木指出，应该说我们国家正面临着不少困难，如果再动乱，再不稳定，这些困难就更加难以克服。希望同学们和社会各方面努力支持党和政府，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，把社会主义现代化事业进行到底，以取得预期的胜利。
    清除“官倒”一靠揭露，二靠制度
    北京航天航空大学一位学生说，同学们提出的“官倒，官倒，不打不倒”的口号，反映了现在存在的一些严重腐败现象。同学们怨气大的是：中央查处官倒的措施总是雷声大，雨点小。人们希望能看到查处的结果。
    袁木说，同学们的心情是可以理解的。我本人对“官倒”也深恶痛绝。但采取打倒的办法，恐怕未必能达到目的。要解决“官倒”问题，主要靠两条：一是靠对问题的揭露。谁掌握了这方面的材料，我们都欢迎向举报中心举报。再一点是靠制度建设，比如现在推行的“两公开，一监督”制度。
    袁木提供了几项数字：１９８８年全国各级人民法院受理刑事案件３１３３０６件，其中包括“官倒”的经济犯罪案件有５５１８０件，审理结案的有５５１７０件，判决的有７４９２３人。目前有２７８４个检察院建立了举报中心，１５８个大中城市建立了举报中心，仅１９８８年下半年就受理各种举报材料１４７０００多件，其中贪污受贿的５２０００多件，已立案侦查的５７００多件，万元以上的１５００多件。据监察部最近提供的材料，一年多来监察机关受理单位和个人检举控告材料７７２９７件，由监察机关立案查处的２５２５５件，到目前已结案１７７５７件，直接给予或建议给予行政处分的有１２６９９人，其中县处级以上干部４３２人；建议给予党纪处分的１１８７人；移送司法机关处理的１５７１人。
    袁木说，我列举这些材料，并不是说查处“官倒”和其他贪污受贿等问题的工作已经取得很大成绩，只是想说明一点，党和政府是真心实意地惩处“官倒”和贪污受贿的，是决心要克服腐败现象的。但不加调查，用简单的“打倒”的办法，可能会导致我们不愿看到的后果。我再次代表国务院欢迎社会各界，包括青年学生对“官倒”等问题进行举报。
    北京理工大学一名学生问：中国出现“官倒”，是社会主义改革的必然现象，还是由于党中央、国务院决策上的失误？袁木回答说，“官倒”的出现，有其经济、政治和社会等方面的原因。从经济上讲，首先是我们的社会生产力还不发达，还处于商品经济的初级阶段，市场发育不健全，因而出现了一些混乱现象；从政治上说，我们的目标是建设社会主义民主政治，但目前还缺乏必要的法制，缺乏必要的制约，以权换钱，以钱换权，权钱结合的现象在一些地方和部门还严重地存在；从思想领域讲，还有封建主义和资本主义腐朽思想的影响。此外，政府决策上出现的失误也是其中的一个因素。要解决这些问题，要靠制度的不断完善，国家在决策上也要更加科学化、民主化，只靠一两次游行示威是解决不了问题的。
    北京医科大学一位学生问：您认为中国最大的“官倒”是谁？治理整顿以来效果如何？
    袁木回答，关于谁是最大的“官倒”，我在这儿很难指名道姓地说清楚。我可以告诉大家，对康华、中信、光大、农业投资等几家大公司，审计署已经派了工作组进行了相当长时间的审计。初步审计的结果已经出来，并决定在情况核实后，公布审计结果。李鹏总理在政府工作报告中也明确表示，各地各部门对整顿公司的结果要采取多种形式加以公布，其中包括登报，接受群众监督，防止走过场。
    要调整教育布局
    北京师范学院的一位学生问：许多同学提出教育问题，请问有什么重视教育的措施？何时兑现？
    何东昌说，去年中共中央政治局决定成立教育领导小组，今年准备召开建国以来第一次专门研究教育问题的中央全会。十年中最大的失误是教育方面的问题，包括思想品德教育和精神文明教育。这里既有社会环境的因素，也有改革中出现的某些失误的因素。我认为，教育的失误是社会主义现代化建设布局上的失误。要调整布局，包括调整财政投入结构，提高教师待遇。首先全党同志要重新认识教育问题的重要性。改善知识分子待遇没有钱不行，北京市今年教育经费投资占全市财政投资的２０％，比去年提高了２％。全国要建立一种新的税种来改善教育，做到人民教育人民办。
    陆宇澄说，关心教育就是关心民族的素质、国家的前途。北京市财政用于教育的投资每年都有增加，中小学师资队伍建设是教育大计，因为教育以教师为本。为了吸引和动员更多的学生上师范，我们将创造一些条件。
    袁木说，今年国家的财政收支相当紧张，相当困难，但由国家拨款的教育经费，还是要由去年的３２０多亿元增加到３７０多亿元，增加５０亿元，增长比例是１５．４％。知识分子待遇低是我们工作中的一个失误，国务院已经认识到这一失误，正在着手解决这一问题。
    中央民族学院的学生问：我是一名共产党员。我觉得对胡耀邦辞职没有做出解释。既然说胡耀邦对改革做出了重大贡献，那么为什么又要让耀邦同志辞职呢，请问党内的民主生活正常吗？
    袁木说，这是党内的问题，我作为国务院的工作人员不便回答这个问题，但作为党员，我愿意谈谈我的看法。胡耀邦同志是伟大的无产阶级革命家、政治家。他忠诚地为社会主义和共产主义事业奋斗了一生，党中央对胡耀邦同志已经做出了很高的评价。胡耀邦同志１９８７年初提出辞职，他对自己在那段工作期间的缺点做了自我批评，他觉得自己不适宜做总书记工作，主动提出辞职，当时曾经过中央政治局扩大会议批准，后来又经过中央全会的批准。
    国家没有新闻检查制度
    北京外国语学院的学生说，要求新闻说真话是学生最强烈的要求之一。我们要求新闻报道全面、真实、及时。如果新闻不自由，民主建设也无从谈起。要取消新闻检查制度。
    袁木说，新闻报道要客观、真实。国务院有关部门正在抓紧草拟新闻法、出版法，如果工作进行得顺利，今年有可能拿出草案来，提请全国人大常委会审议。我是记者出身。据我所知，国家没有新闻检查制度，新闻报道工作实行的是报社总编辑负责制。有时当他们感到有些报道难以把握时，也往往会将稿子送到有关部门审阅核实。报禁问题是指旧社会的新闻审查制度，有时对一些新闻报道，检查官不让发，补别的稿子排版来不及，就会出现报纸“开天窗”的现象。现在没有这种现象。
    何东昌说，新闻也没有绝对的自由，也要受法律的约束，要承担必要的社会责任。报纸上的每一行字，每篇文章都要对读者负责任。
    袁木补充说，根据宪法，新闻报道享有自由，同时，也受到宪法和法律的约束。因为报道承担着社会责任，要对广大读者负责，不能有什么报道什么，这在任何国家都是如此。
    学生和公安战士要互相谅解
    中国政法大学等校学生提出，在４月２０日学生游行和静坐过程中有警察打学生的现象。
    袁立本说，“４·２０”那天，我在新华门现场，我看见有人从后面朝武警战士扔汽水瓶。游行队伍走后，新华门前有许多汽水瓶渣。有人传言，有警察带警棍，用大头鞋踢学生。根本就没有持警棍和穿大头鞋的警察。有关部门规定，武警上岗必须扎皮带，穿胶鞋，公安干警中有些人穿的是皮鞋，但没有大头鞋。如果有人看见警察带警棍，请指出来。有关部门对武警和公安人员经常进行文明执勤、严守纪律的教育，不准打人。当然武警战士和公安人员有的比较年轻，不能保证上百上千个武警战士和公安人员都不犯一点错误。公安干警也有挨打的，希望大家相互谅解。如果有武警战士和公安人员有过激行为，打了人，查有实据，也要依法处理。我们已做出规定，凡是有学生反映武警战士或公安人员打人的问题，武警部队或公安部门都要派人到学校找到他，核实情况，做出处理。
    只要不触犯法律，一概不究
    北京林业大学的学生提出，“４·２１”、“４·２７”两次学生游行，有数以万计的北京市民欢迎，有的把钱、烟扔给大学生，有的喊：“大学生万岁！”学生的爱国运动是民心所向。
    袁木说，大多数同学怀着满腔热情，要求推进改革，反对腐败的愿望与党和政府的工作目标是完全一致的。
    何东昌接着说，同学们在游行中喊的是拥护共产党，拥护社会主义，拥护宪法，拥护四项基本原则等口号。如果有人混在队伍中，提出反对四项基本原则，也不会有这么多学生参加。搞动乱谁高兴？一些用心不良的人高兴，台湾、香港、美国的一些右翼势力高兴，北京大学就出现了在美国的反动组织中国民联的支持信。
    袁木希望大多数学生在保持满腔热情时，要多一点理智和冷静。
    袁立本说，北京有１０００万人口，流动人口近２００万。２７日学生游行那天，北京有３０多万人坐不上公共汽车，有许多人取不到牛奶，换不上煤气罐。这一点《北京日报》今天已作了报道。游行使交通严重阻塞，影响生产。
    袁立本说，现在发现有人到中学串联。大学生有满腔热情的一面，也有理智的一面，但是中学生一旦乱起来，局面就难以控制。希望不要去中学串联。关于游行问题，同学们可以做个调查，许多国家有游行法，到什么地方游行，如何组织，甚至连哪些口号不能喊都有规定。在有些国家，如果违反游行规定都会受到制裁，使用警棍和警具就不必说了。
    北京科技大学的学生问，学生游行，为什么用解放军阻挡？
    袁立本回答说，我们的游行十条是为维护社会治安和人民利益的。未经批准的游行违反了这一规定，因此我们对游行不赞成。北京的警察不多，学生游行时又要防止有坏人趁机捣乱，为了保护王府井、大栅栏一带商业区也分散了不少力量。这样做是从全局考虑的。
    北京师范大学的一位学生问：既然把极少数人同广大学生分开，那么中央对学生运动将怎样评价，对运动的组织者如何对待？
    何东昌回答，只要不触犯国家法律、法规，无论对学生，对教师，还是对任何人，哪怕说过一些出格的话，做过一些出格的事，一概不追究责任。袁木表示完全赞成何东昌同志的意见，并表示将把这个意见转告给国务院有关部门。
    对党要有基本估计
    清华大学一学生问：许多同学反映现在党风不正、腐败现象严重。根据有人画的“关系图”，一些干部子弟凭借裙带关系获得高级职务。请问怎样从制度上解决这些问题？
    袁木说，关于党风，现在确实存在许多问题。但我想说一点，对我们的党还是要有个基本估计。应该承认，这几年党风问题确实有日益严重的趋向，这是事实。但从整体上看，我们的党还是好的。学生们不是也打出了“拥护共产党”的标语吗？如果这个党彻底腐败了，变质了，不要说同学们不拥护，我也不拥护。
    他说，近１０年间，党和政府坚持“一个中心，两个基本点”，基本的路线、方针和政策是正确的。不管怎么说，这１０年间我们国家发生了历史性的变化，这是谁也否认不了的事实。但由于历史上和政治上的一些原因，包括由于我们反对资产阶级自由化不坚决，以及实行对外开放以后的一些消极影响，所以带来了相当严重的党风不正的问题。但是，党是有决心、有信心克服这些问题的。
    袁木说，至于“关系图”，这要分析。有些人把与领导人同姓的中青年负责干部说成是某领导人的儿子，不同姓的说成是女婿，有的与事实完全不符，有的出入很大。总之，我不赞成画“关系图”这类的作法，像“文革”中搞的“百丑图”，社会效果不好，不利于安定团结。
    北京建工学院一学生问：中央提出要过几年紧日子，领导干部应该与广大群众同甘共苦。但有的领导却一个星期携夫人打一次高尔夫球。
    袁木说，我不知道这个情况。我可以转达你的意见。七届人大二次会议的政府工作报告中已明确表示，中央国家机关和各级政府机关要带头过几年紧日子。在这里，我可以告诉大家，中央已经决定，从今年起，夏天不再到北戴河办公。因为那样会增加财政开支，造成交通紧张，与过几年紧日子的要求不相适宜。
    他说，中央还决定，从现在起，国家不再进口豪华轿车。
    北方工业大学一学生说，中央说不论对任何人，只要有贪污行为都要进行查处。如果有，请公布事实。
    袁木说，我可以完全负责地说，中央和地方的领导机关中，不论是哪一级干部，如果有贪污现象，一定严肃查处。但让我现在就公布事实，这很困难，不仅仅在于我并不了解全部情况，更在于我讲的话要负法律责任。因为，许多问题的查处要经过一定的法律程序。这点，请大家能够谅解。
    对话形式可以多种多样，层次可高可低，但不包括非法成立的组织
    有些学校的学生提出，对话应在同学生选举的、能够代表学生的代表中进行，并希望同党和国家高层领导直接对话。
    袁木说，我认为对话的方式可以多种多样，层次可高可低。对话，不是对手之间的谈判。政府与学生之间不存在谈判问题，而是为了相互交谈，沟通思想，增进理解。只要大家有诚意，愿意坐在一起谈，就不应该有什么先决条件。
    当一位政法大学的学生提出政府应同“北京大学生自治联合会”对话时，袁木和何东昌明确表示，我们是来同全国学联、北京市学联邀请的学生进行座谈、对话的。对未经认可的非法学生组织，我们不予承认。
    对话进行了近三个小时。主持座谈对话的全国学联负责人表示，今天的对话气氛很好，今后愿意继续组织这样的对话。
