Xinhua News Agency, Dortmund, April 7th

The singles matches at the 40th World Table Tennis Championships have so far seen no major upsets. Chinese women Li Huifen and Liu Wei both lost their matches. In the mixed doubles, eight out of the ten Chinese pairs have advanced to the top 16.

The mixed doubles competition began this morning and after three rounds, the top 16 pairs have been determined. Eight out of the ten Chinese pairs have successfully advanced, making up half of the top 16. Tomorrow, the mixed doubles matches to determine the top 8 will feature the following pairs: Wei Qingguang and Li Huifen against the Netherlands' Spanjaard and Kloppenburg, Chen Zhibin and Gao Jun against Bulgaria's Rokov and England's Holt, Xu Zengcai and Li Jun against Yugoslavia's Kalenic and Perkučin, Yu Shentong and Chen Zihua against North Korea's Kim Sung-hui and Ri Pun-gil, Chen Longcan and Chen Jing against North Korea's Yu Myong-sun and Cho Chong-hui, Hui Jun and Qiao Hong against North Korea's Chu Chong-chol and Yu Byong-suk, Teng Yi and Hu Xiaoxin against Lin Zhigang and Liu Wei, and South Korea's Ryu Seung-min and Hyun Jung-hwa against Austria's Ding Yi and Bulgaria's Gergercheva.

Li Huifen, who played a crucial role in the women's team final for China, was unexpectedly eliminated last night in the second round of the women's singles after losing 0-3 to North Korea's chopper An Haesuk. Another Chinese woman, Liu Wei, defeated Hong Kong's main player Chi Poh-wah in the first round but was then beaten 3-1 by Hungary's Vértes in the second round.

Analyzing the losses of Li Huifen and Liu Wei, Chinese team coaches Xi Enqing and Zhang Li said that Li Huifen has always struggled against defensive players. In her match against An Haesuk, she failed to win the first set, and in the subsequent sets, she couldn't execute her forehand shots effectively, leading to a downward spiral. Liu Wei's main issue was her inability to handle the opponent's serves, allowing them to launch continuous attacks. In the third set, she led 17-10 but failed to close it out, which significantly affected her morale.

The overall situation in the singles matches at the World Table Tennis Championships remains stable, with few major upsets. Other notable players who were eliminated include South Korea's second-ranked woman player Hong Sun-hwa, who lost 1-3 to China's young player Deng Yaping, and Czechoslovakia's famous player Kasilova, who lost 2-3 to a Japanese chopper.

“What do you think?” The reporters surrounded China's table tennis team leader Xu Yansheng.

“Have another!”

　　世乒赛单项各路健儿尚无惊人之举
    中国女将李惠芬刘伟失利　混双我有８对进入前１６名
    本报多特蒙德４月７日电  记者刘小明、江建国报道：第４０届世乒赛的混合双打比赛今天上午开战后，一口气连打３轮产生了前１６名。参赛的１０对中国选手有８对顺利过关，占了前１６名的一半。明天混合双打争夺前８名的对阵形势是：韦晴光和李惠芬对荷兰的斯潘伊和克洛彭伯格、陈志斌和高军对保加利亚的罗科夫和英格兰的霍尔特、许增才和李隽对南斯拉夫的卡列尼茨和佩尔库钦、于沈潼和陈子荷对朝鲜队金成熙和李粉姬、陈龙灿和陈静对朝鲜队俞明成和赵正姬、惠钧和乔红对朝鲜队朱钟哲和尤炳淑、滕毅和胡小新对林志刚和刘伟、南朝鲜队刘南奎和玄静和对奥地利的丁毅和保加利亚的格尔格尔切娃。
    女子团体决赛中为中国队立下战功的李惠芬，昨晚在女子单打第二轮中以０∶３输给朝鲜队的削球手安海淑，意外地被淘汰。另一位中国女将刘伟先胜了香港队主力齐宝华后，第２轮中被匈牙利的维尔特以３∶１击败。
    中国队教练郗恩庭、张立分析李惠芬和刘伟的失利原因时说，李惠芬原来对付防守型选手的能力就较弱，同安海淑的第１局又没有咬下来，后两局正手抽不上，越打越不顺手。刘伟主要是接发球没有处理好，被对手连连抢攻，第３局她１７∶１０领先没有拿下来，大大影响了士气。
    世乒赛单项比赛的总战况平稳，大的冷门很少。被淘汰的较为知名的选手还有，南朝鲜女队第二号主力洪顺花以１∶３负于中国小将邓亚萍，捷克斯洛伐克名将卡萨洛娃以２∶３负于日本女队的一位削球手。
