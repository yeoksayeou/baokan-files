Fishing Boats Return to the Fuxi River

From the changes in the Fuxi River, we can discuss raising environmental awareness.

"Fishing boats return to the Fuxi River"—in "half city green mountains, half city buildings" Zigong, compared to the West Qin Hall that collects and displays traditional salt production tools, compared to the dinosaur fossil group in Dashanpu that can be called a world wonder, compared to the silicified wood from the Middle Jurassic, this indeed does not count as a spectacular sight. However, when Zigong Vice Mayor Jiang Rencheng reported to a delegation from the State Council Environmental Protection Commission, he treated it as a piece of news.

If you know a little about the past of the Fuxi River, you will agree that the news value of the reappearance of "fishing boats at dusk" here is significant. This water is the lifeline of the "Salt City," providing drinking water for 1.5 million people, irrigating 1.12 million acres of farmland, and supplying more than 85% of industrial water. At the same time, a large amount of industrial wastewater and domestic sewage from salt, chemical, electroplating, and other industries are discharged into it without any other choice. "During the dry season, the river water turns green and cannot be used, and the incidence of hepatitis in the local area increases significantly..." This is the description in a document from the national environmental protection department more than ten years ago. Now, the urban section of the river, where fish were once on the verge of extinction, sees fishing boats again, how can one not be delighted!

If you are deeply concerned about the worsening water quality of one river after another in our motherland, you will definitely see a glimmer of hope in this river that is being purified. In Neijiang, Sichuan, there is also a river named "Qinglong," but in reality, it is a "polluted dragon." The black liquid discharged day and night by five small paper mills has killed this "Qinglong." In contrast, the revival of the Fuxi River is precious.

For the same river, some are becoming more polluted, while others are becoming less polluted. Although the reasons are relatively complex and the difficulties are not the same, it still reflects the environmental awareness of local leaders to some extent. Zigong also has small paper mills that emerged with the development of township enterprises. When they saw the severe reality of one factory polluting a river, they resolutely shut down the small paper mills, despite objections from the grassroots and the need to reassign personnel. The environmental protection officials in Zigong boast not only the environmental protection building on Tanmu Forest Street and the complete environmental protection institutions but also the story of Mayor Lu Qiang winning an award for writing an environmental protection paper.

As leaders like Lu Qiang and Jiang Rencheng, they face the troubles brought by the pollution of a river and a factory. However, the environmental problem is not a local issue but a comprehensive one. Whether each local area pays attention to it and does it well or not directly relates to the implementation of the basic state policy of environmental protection. "Humanity has only one Earth," and we also have only the land of China as our living space. Protecting the natural environment from damage is the sacred duty and legal responsibility of every citizen, especially every leader. The key to raising the environmental awareness of the entire nation is to raise the environmental awareness of leaders at all levels. Even if it is the manager of a township enterprise, a township head, a county magistrate, a mayor, in this matter, they should think about the things that the Premier thinks about. Without a macro perspective and a sense of crisis, it is easy to make a serious mistake in environmental issues that is difficult to rectify.

Some people say that clear flowing water and fresh air are bought with money. Indeed, treating pollution requires money, and protecting the environment is constrained by economic conditions. What should we do? There are two paths in front of us: one is to rely on high investment and high technology to solve environmental problems, like the developed countries in the West, but our country's economic development level does not yet have the material conditions to take this path; the other path is to mainly rely on strengthening environmental management. Whether it is water pollution or air pollution, a considerable part is caused by negligent management. At the foot of the Leshan Giant Buddha, there is a cement plant with rolling dust. The delegation from the State Council Environmental Protection Commission that went to Sichuan did not give notice and entered the plant for inspection. The director immediately said, "Solve the problem in one month." Problems like this can be solved if someone pushes a little, indicating that the main issue is poor management.

We must not take the path of neglecting environmental protection, allowing the water to become turbid and black, allowing the air to be filled with smoke and dust, and allowing acid rain to destroy the natural ecosystem.

The initial treatment of the Fuxi River sees the return of fishing boats, bringing the good news of environmental protection.

　　又见打鱼船
    ——从釜溪河的变化谈提高环保意识
    李仁臣
    “渔舟重现釜溪河”——这在“半城青山半城楼”的自贡，比起收藏陈列井盐传统生产工具的西秦会馆，比起堪称世界奇观的大山铺恐龙化石群，比起中侏罗纪遗下的硅化木，确实算不上什么令人注目的景观。但是，自贡市副市长姜仁初在向前来视察的国务院环保委员会一个小组汇报时，却俨然把它当作一条新闻。
    假如你对釜溪河的过去略知一二，就会认同这里再现“渔舟唱晚”景象的新闻价值。此水乃“盐都”之命脉，１５０万人饮用，１１２万亩农田灌溉，８５％以上的工业用水，盖取于斯。同时，大量盐业、化工、电镀等工业废水和生活污水又别无选择地倾入其中。“枯水期河水呈绿色，不能使用，当地肝炎病显著增多……”这就是十几年前国家环保部门一份文件描绘的景象。现在，鱼类曾濒临绝迹的城区河段又见打鱼船，怎不令人欣喜！
    假如你对祖国一条又一条江河水质日益恶化的现状深感忧虑，就一定会从这条河流正在净化中看到一点希望。在四川内江，也有一条河，名为“青龙”，实为“污龙”，五个小造纸厂日夜倾吐的黑液，扼杀了这条“青龙”。两相对照，反衬出釜溪河重现生机的可贵。
    同样是一条河，有的污染日甚，有的污染日轻，虽说原因比较复杂，苦衷不尽相同，但它毕竟从一个侧面反映着当地领导的环保意识。自贡市也有在发展乡镇企业中应运而生的小造纸厂，当他们看到一个小厂污染一条河流的严峻现实时，就毅然关掉小造纸厂，尽管基层有意见，人员须安置，他们却初衷不改。自贡市环保干部向来访者夸耀的，不光是位于檀木林大街上的环保大楼、健全的环保机构，还有他们的陆强市长撰写环保论文得奖的佳话。
    作为陆强、姜仁初这样的领导者，他们面对的是一条河流、一个工厂污染带来的烦恼。但是，环境问题不是个局部问题，而是全局问题。每一个局部重视与否，搞得好坏，都直接关系到保护环境这项基本国策的实施。“人类只有一个地球”，我们也只有神州大地这一块生存空间，保护自然环境不受破坏，是每个公民，首先是每个领导者的神圣义务和法律责任。提高全民族的环保意识，关键是提高各级领导者的环保意识。哪怕是一个乡镇企业的厂长、经理，一个乡长、镇长，一个县长、市长，在这个问题上也要想国家总理想的事情，没有宏观视野，缺乏危机意识，在环境问题上难免不造成积重难返的大错。
    有人说，明净的流水、清爽的空气是钱买来的。不错，治理污染需要钱，保护环境确实受到经济条件的制约。怎么办？摆在我们面前有两条路：一条是靠高投资高技术解决环境问题，像西方发达国家那样，只是我国经济发展水平还不具备走这条路的物质条件；另一条路，是主要依靠强化环境管理。不论是水污染，还是大气污染，有相当一部分是疏于管理造成的。在乐山大佛脚下，有一个水泥厂，粉尘滚滚，国务院环保委员会赴四川的视察组不打招呼，进厂检查，厂长当即表示：“一个月解决问题。”像这类问题有人逼一逼就能解决，说明主要是管理不善。
    我们千万不能走将环保置诸脑后那条路，听任流水变质发黑，听任大气弥漫烟雾粉尘，听任酸雨毁坏自然生态。
    初步治理的釜溪河上重现渔帆，传递的是保护环境的春讯。
