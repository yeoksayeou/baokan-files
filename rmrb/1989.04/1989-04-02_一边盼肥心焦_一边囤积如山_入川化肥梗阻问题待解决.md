Currently, within the jurisdiction of Guangyuan City, Sichuan, there are still piles of fertilizer resembling small mountains at the Chaotian and Ranhe stations under the jurisdiction of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau. These fertilizers are transported from Xi'an to Sichuan and unloaded here. Due to the inconvenient water and land transportation in this area, many fertilizers have been exposed to the elements for half a year, suffering from sun and rain, resulting in significant damage to the packaging, scattering, evaporation, and loss of fertilizers. Meanwhile, it is the critical period for top-dressing in Sichuan's small spring crops and sowing of large spring crops. We urgently request that the railway department address the farmers' concerns and promptly resolve the issue of fertilizer transportation in this section.

Chaotian and Ranhe stations are the boundary stations between the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau and the Chengdu Railway Bureau. Tens of thousands of tons of fertilizers entering Sichuan are unloaded here, requiring a large number of workers to carry them to the riverbank, use small wooden boats to cross the Jialing River, and then load them onto trucks to be transported to Guangyuan and further to various parts of Sichuan. This process consumes a tremendous amount of manpower, resources, and funds, severely delaying the agricultural season.

Since last winter and this spring, hundreds of trucks have been rushing to transport fertilizers here every day, but it has not been effective. Chaotian and Ranhe stations are only a few dozen kilometers away from Guangyuan Railway Station. Guangyuan Station has very convenient transportation, serving as a water and land transportation hub and a material distribution center in northwestern Sichuan. If the fertilizer cars unloaded at Chaotian or Ranhe could be extended to Guangyuan Station, it would reduce many intermediate transfer links, save a significant amount of funds, and timely serve the frontline of agricultural production. We hope that the relevant departments will coordinate quickly, prioritize the overall situation, and prioritize the people's interests to get this multi-benefit matter done properly.

### 一边盼肥心焦　一边囤积如山  入川化肥梗阻问题待解决

　　一边盼肥心焦　一边囤积如山
    入川化肥梗阻问题待解决
    目前，四川广元市境内郑州铁路局所辖的朝天车站和冉家河车站上，仍囤积着一堆堆山头似的化肥。这些化肥是由西安方向发往四川在此下车的。由于此地水陆运输都极不方便，许多化肥露天堆积达半年之久，日晒雨淋，致使包装破损，散落挥发和丢失的化肥数额惊人。而眼下正是四川小春追肥和大春播种的关键时期，我们恳请铁路部门急农民之所急，迅速解决这一地段的化肥运输问题。
    朝天、冉家河车站是郑州铁路局和成都铁路局的交界站，运进四川的数以千万吨计的化肥在此下车，要靠大量民工扛到河边，用小木船送过嘉陵江，才能装上汽车运往广元，发向四川各地，耗费了巨大的人力、物力、财力，严重耽误农时。
    去冬今春以来，每天都有数以百辆次计的卡车在这里抢运化肥，但仍无济于事。
    朝天、冉家河站距广元火车站不过几十公里地。广元站交通十分发达，是川西北的水陆交通枢纽和物资集散地。如果在朝天或冉家河卸化肥的车皮，能延长运到广元站，就可减少许多中转环节，节约大笔资金，还可以及时地为农业生产第一线服务。希望有关部门迅速协调，以大局为重，以人民利益为重，把这件一举几得的事办妥。
