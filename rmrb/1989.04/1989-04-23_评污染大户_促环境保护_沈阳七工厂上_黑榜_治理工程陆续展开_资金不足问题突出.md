In the assessment of "major polluters" conducted in Shenyang, seven enterprises have been listed on the "blacklist": Shenyang Smelting Plant, Shenyang Thermal Power Plant, Shenyang Steel Plant, Shenyang Casting Plant, Northeast Pharmaceutical Factory No. 6, Shenyang Wool Scouring Plant, and Xincheng Chemical Plant.

Shenyang's diverse industries have severely polluted the environment in various ways. According to a recent report by the United Nations, Shenyang is the second city in the world with the highest concentration of sulfur dioxide in the air, after Milan, Italy. The city's monthly dustfall is around 46 tons, also ranking among the highest in the world. Of the other 20-plus standards, only the heavy metal content is basically qualified; all others are not. The severe pollution has caused significant harm: the Hun River, which nourishes the people of Shenyang, has lost all its fish and shrimp; 29 sheep in Xinmin County died after eating grass from the river basin; in Yuhong District, a rice crop from an irrigation area has been banned from consumption due to excessive chromium in the soil and water...

Investigations have shown that the severe pollution in Shenyang is concentrated in a few enterprises. For example, the Shenyang Smelting Plant alone accounts for 40% of the total sulfur dioxide emissions in the city. During the month of assessing "major polluters," some of these enterprises have already taken measures: the Smelting Plant has invested 20 million yuan in the construction of a secondary purification station and improved the lead smelting dust collection system; Northeast Pharmaceutical Factory No. 6 has invested 7 million yuan in wastewater treatment, with initial results; the Thermal Power Plant has immediately launched technical renovations to utilize fly ash comprehensively, and so on.

However, some leaders of the "major polluters" have expressed their determination to address pollution while also raising a problem: they have the will but lack the means. There are many things that need to be renovated, but funds are insufficient. They hope that relevant departments will allocate some funds to the enterprises for environmental treatment.

### 评污染大户　促环境保护  沈阳七工厂上“黑榜”  治理工程陆续展开　资金不足问题突出

　　评污染大户　促环境保护
    沈阳七工厂上“黑榜”    
    治理工程陆续展开　资金不足问题突出
    本报讯  记者段心强报道：在沈阳市开展的评定“污染大户”活动中，有７个企业被列上“黑榜”：沈阳冶炼厂、沈阳热电厂、沈阳钢厂、沈阳铸造厂、东北第六制药厂、沈阳洗毛厂、新城化工厂。
    门类齐全的工业，使沈阳环境从各方面受到严重污染。据联合国不久前公布的一项报告表明，空气中含二氧化硫最高的１０个城市中，除了意大利的米兰外，第二名就是沈阳市。全市每月的降尘量４６吨上下，在世界上也名列前茅；其他２０多项标准，除重金属含量基本合格外，都不合格。严重的污染带来巨大危害：哺育沈阳人民的母亲河——浑河，鱼虾绝迹；新民县２９只羊吃了河套的草，全部死去；于洪区一个灌区，因为水土中含铬过多，所产大米已禁止食用……
    据调查，对沈阳环境污染严重的集中在为数不多的企业。如全市空中的二氧化硫总量中，仅沈阳冶炼厂排放的就占４０％。在评“污染大户”的一个月中，一些“污染大户”已主动采取了措施：冶炼厂已投入２０００万元搞二次净化总站工程，完善铅冶炼收尘系统；东北第六制药厂已投入７００万元搞污水处理工程，并且初见成效；热电厂立即开展技术改造，搞粉煤灰综合利用，等等。
    但“污染大户”的一些领导人在表示今后治理污染的决心同时，还提出一个问题：心有余而力不足。要改造的东西很多，但资金不够。希望有关部门给企业增留一点治理环境的资金。
