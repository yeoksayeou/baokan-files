Just as novels, poetry, music, ballet, and drama, French fashion and architecture hold a significant position in the world. Luxurious and elegant French fashion has become the spiritual benchmark of modern fashion, admired by many. Recently, the "Paris Fashion Night" held in Beijing showcased its elegant and transcendent charm, leaving the audience in awe. Although this was only a small bouquet in a fragrant sea of flowers.

French fashion's leading position in the world is due to the high artistic status of fashion in the minds of the French people. As a country that values both traditional and modern art, life and environment are highly artistic. Their demands and appreciation for fashion are imbued with artistic spirit. Fashion has long been integrated into the overall French modern culture, embodying its fundamental spirit. On one hand, there is an open-minded and innovative attitude, absorbing everything new and even completely "anti-traditional." France has a group of "creators" who specialize in ready-to-wear clothing, using the latest thinking and methods to give people in France and abroad the feeling of being "ahead of the times." On the other hand, France maintains the most traditional and rigorous style and elegance. Currently, France still produces high-end women's clothing, even inheriting the sartorial traditions of the royal era. These clothes are tailored to fit, completed by hand in the designer's studio. It is said that there are only about two thousand customers worldwide. However, it is precisely because of this that France can firmly grasp both ends of fashion art, adapt to all situations, and flow endlessly.

The stage setting, lighting, music, and fashion of the "Paris Fashion Night" complement each other, embodying the overall atmosphere that art pursues. Moreover, the colors are harmonious, and the rhythm is orderly. Different music, backgrounds, and lighting are used to highlight different styles of fashion, creating distinct moods that are worth savoring, much like appreciating an artistic performance. Unlike some of our fashion shows, which always have a uniform wooden backdrop, music that is limited to powerful vocals, and minimal lighting changes, it seems that the purpose is just to showcase the fashion and models to the audience, lacking an overall artistic feel, making it boring.

The most interesting part is that when we open the "program," the French side's greeting is from the Minister of Culture, while the Chinese side is from the Minister of the Textile Industry. This is perhaps not just a difference in titles, but also a reflection of two different mindsets: is fashion a form of culture? Or is it just a beautiful industrial product? I remember that at many fashion show events, what I often heard was, "This outfit can't be worn out," "How can you wear such clothes to take the bus?" "My mom would look good in this suit," and so on. At last year's Dalian Fashion Week, a high-ranking cultural official's only comment after watching a few fashion shows was: "Why are there no clothes for the middle-aged and elderly?" It can be seen that we have not yet elevated fashion to an art form and are used to viewing fashion shows in a very practical and utilitarian way. When fashion models appear on stage, we do not look at them with an artistic eye but limit our thinking to "wearing." Of course, fashion also has its commercial and practical aspects, but we need to appreciate the cultural way, aesthetic concepts, and artistic charm that fashion represents. This is the true appreciation of fashion.

　　“巴黎时装之夜”外谈
    顾土
    如同小说、诗歌、音乐、芭蕾、戏剧一样，法国的时装和建筑在世界上也具有举足轻重的地位。华贵、典雅的法国时装已成为现代时装的精神典范，受到人们的崇尚。最近在北京举行的“巴黎时装之夜”，其洒脱、超逸的耀人风采，终于展现在我们这些不大讲究服装的人们面前，撩拨得观众惊叹不已。虽然这只不过是芬芳花海中的小小一束。
    法国时装在世界的先导地位，得力于时装在法国人心目中的崇高的艺术形象。作为一个传统艺术与现代艺术并重的国家，人的生活、环境也高度艺术化，他们对时装的要求和审视，洋溢着艺术的气息。时装早已纳入了法兰西现代文化的整体，贯穿着其现代文化的基本精神。一方面是异想天开、标新立异的开放态度，吸收一切新奇的东西，甚至完全的“反传统”。法国有一批“创作人”，他们专事成衣，采用最新思维、最新方式，使法国内外的许许多多人享受“超前”快感。另一方面，法国又保持着最传统最严谨的格调和气派。目前法国还生产传统的高级女装，甚至承袭着王朝时代的服装传统。这些服装量体裁衣，在设计师的工作间里以手工完成。据说顾客在全世界也不过屈指可数的二千余人。然而，正因为如此，才使法国在时装艺术的无论哪一端，都能稳稳把握，左右逢源，长流不息。
    “巴黎时装之夜”的舞台布景、灯光、音乐、时装交相辉映，体现出艺术所追求的总体气氛。而且色调有致、节奏有序，用不同的音乐、布景、灯光，衬托不同风格的时装，共同创造出相异的意境，耐人回味，就如欣赏一台艺术表演一般。不像我们的一些时装表演，后面总是清一色的屏风式的大木板，音乐离不开烈性的歌喉，灯光极少变化，似乎只是为了向人们展示时装和模特，不太注重整体的艺术感，令人乏味。
    最有意思的是，当我们翻开“说明书”时，法国方面祝辞的是文化部长，而中国却是纺织工业部长。这恐怕不仅仅是职务的不同，从中透露的是两种观念的差异：时装是文化？或者仅仅是漂亮的工业品？记得在许多时装表演的场合，耳边听到的多是“这身衣服穿不出去”、“穿那样的衣服如何挤公共汽车”、“我妈穿这样的套装挺合适的”，等等。在去年的大连服装节中，一位高级文化官员看过几场时装表演后的唯一感叹竟是：怎么没有中老年服装？可见，我们仍没有将时装升华为一种艺术，习惯于太实太功利化地观赏时装表演。当时装模特出现在舞台上时，不是带着一种艺术的眼光去感受，而把思维囿于“穿”的里面。当然，时装也有其商业性、实用性的一面，但我们更需要从时装所表现的文化方式、审美观念、艺术情调中去体味时装的光彩。这才是真正和时装欣赏。
