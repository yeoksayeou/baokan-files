On the morning of February 22, a woman from our city went to the municipal hospital to request the insertion of an IUD. The doctor said, "Our hospital only has one type of IUD, and we don't know if it suits everyone. Go to another place to get it inserted."

This woman then went to the Women and Children's Health Center of the Xilingol League. She saw two doctors chatting and asked, "Excuse me, doctors, do you insert IUDs here?" They replied, "No, we don't." She asked again, "Why not?" They answered, "We don't have any disinfectants."

Our city has large, prominent banners everywhere saying, "Family planning is a fundamental national policy." But this woman was at a loss as to who would implement this policy.

### 要想节育真困难  无处给上避孕环

　　要想节育真困难  无处给上避孕环
    二月二十二日上午，我市一妇女来到市医院要求上避孕环，大夫说：“本院只有一种型号的环，不知适合于什么人，你到别处去上环吧！”
    这位妇女又来到锡林郭勒盟妇幼保健所，见两位大夫在闲聊，便问：“请问大夫，这里给上避孕环吗？”答曰：“不给上！”再问：“为什么？”再答曰：“没有消毒用品。”
    我市到处悬挂着醒目的大幅标语：“计划生育是一项基本国策。”但这位妇女茫然不知这项国策谁来执行。
