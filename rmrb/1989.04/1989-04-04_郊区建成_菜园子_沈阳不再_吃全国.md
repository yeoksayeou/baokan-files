	Formerly, during every festive season, people from Shenyang would travel far and wide to purchase food supplies. Now, they no longer need to display that "tiger-like" determination. In just five years since 1984, they have established a large "vegetable garden" in two counties and four districts that can basically meet local needs.

	In 1978, each person in Shenyang could only consume 4.5 kilograms of locally produced meat, eggs, and milk, with the rest having to be imported from other provinces. For many years, Shenyang residents have "eaten" their way across the nation. Starting from 1984, Shenyang City has made great efforts to build a base for subsidiary food products. Now, a family of three in Shenyang can enjoy over 120 kilograms of meat, eggs, and other products from this large "vegetable garden" each year, with a basic supply of vegetables ensuring "greens" throughout the four seasons. Currently, except for a slight shortage of pork, other subsidiary food products have basically achieved self-sufficiency.

　　郊区建成“菜园子”  沈阳不再“吃全国”
    据新华社沈阳４月３日电  （记者牟丰京）昔日每逢年节走京闯关抢购食品的沈阳人，如今再也不必显那份“虎”相了。１９８４年后短短的５年里，他们已在二县四区建起了能基本自给的大“菜园子”。
    １９７８年，每个沈阳人只能吃到４．５公斤当地产的肉蛋奶，其余的要靠从外省调进。多年来，沈阳人“吃”遍了全国。从１９８４年开始，沈阳市下大力气建设副食品基地。现在，沈阳市一个三口之家，每年可从这个大“菜园子”里享受到肉、蛋等１２０多公斤，蔬菜供应基本做到四季有“绿”。目前，除猪肉稍缺外，其余副食品基本实现自给。
