A couple who collects and sells discarded items have, over sixteen years, rescued and raised more than twenty abandoned infants. Their warm-hearted deeds have touched the hearts of millions.

However, their noble actions have been tarnished by certain officials who have labeled them as "disruptive." These officials believe that when others take on responsibilities that should be theirs, it reflects poorly on them, and that maintaining their own reputation is more important than saving lives. This is absurd. Does ignoring abandoned infants and refusing to help when someone is in danger truly bring glory to socialism?

A lack of emotion does not make one a true hero. Lenin once said: Without human emotions, there has never been and can never be a pursuit of truth. Comrades should care for, love, and help each other, and practice revolutionary humanitarianism towards all people. This aligns with the teachings of Marx and Lenin and is also a traditional virtue of the Chinese nation.

From ancient times, the Chinese people have valued benevolence. Life's journey cannot be without love. Loving others and being loved in return is one of life's greatest joys. Unfortunately, in recent years, some people have become indifferent to benevolence. Not only do they not help others in times of difficulty, but they even hesitate to offer a smile. Those who exploit others' misfortunes and refuse to help even when someone is in danger have their own theories: "Benevolence is an outdated tradition." In reality, it is the distortion of human nature, the sale of the soul, and the decline of morality that should be condemned. Tradition is not always outdated. We can confidently "adopt" good traditions without fearing that others will call us "uncivilized."

Those who are truly "uncivilized" are those who eat "public funds," sit in "high positions," and speak in "official jargon" while pursuing personal gain. Their moral standards are far below those of this uneducated, homeless couple who collect discarded items. For those who always claim to be "public servants" but make life difficult for the people, the urgent task is to receive some basic education on how to be a human being.

Society needs warm hearts, and the Four Modernizations need warm hearts. If everyone can warm each other and care for each other, then our society will be a harmonious and warm spring!

　　社会需要热心肠
　　舒瑜
    一对拣破烂的夫妇，十六年间拣回并养育了二十多个弃婴。他们的古道热肠感动了千千万万的人。
    然而，他们高尚的行为却被某些长官强加上“抹黑”的罪名。因为这些长官觉得，别人将自家负责的事管起来，是扫了自家的颜面，而顾及自家的颜面倒比挽救别人的生命更重要。这当然是荒唐的。难道对弃婴不管不问、见死不救，才叫为社会主义增光添彩么？
    无情未必真英豪。列宁说过：没有人的感情，就从来没有也不可能有对于真理的追求。同志之间互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助，对一切人实行革命的人道主义，既符合马列的教导，也是中华民族的传统美德。
    自古以来，华夏子孙最重视仁爱。人生之旅不能没有爱。爱人而又被人所爱，乃人生一大乐趣。遗憾的是，这些年某些人对仁爱淡漠了。别说解人之难，扶人之困，就连笑容也吝啬得不给他人。见死不救、乘人之危下手的人还有一套理论：“仁爱，陈腐的传统。”其实，人性的扭曲，灵魂的拍卖，道德的沦丧，才应该受到斥责。传统并不都是陈腐的。对优良传统，我们尽可以理直气壮地“拿来”，不要怕别人在背后议论我们“不开化”。
    真正“不开化”者，是那些吃“皇粮”、坐“高堂”、打“官腔”的谋私者。他们的道德水准，远远不及这对无文化、无户口的拣破烂的夫妻。对那些言必称“公仆”而又处处为难百姓的人说来，当务之急是接受一点怎样做人的启蒙教育。
    社会需要热心肠，四化需要热心肠。如果大家都相互送暖，彼此关心，那么我们的社会就会是一个亲切融洽、和谐温馨的春天！
