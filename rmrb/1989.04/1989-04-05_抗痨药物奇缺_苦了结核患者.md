Title: The Shortage of Anti-Tuberculosis Drugs Causes Suffering for Tuberculosis Patients

The shortage of anti-tuberculosis drugs has caused great suffering for tuberculosis patients. My county is one of the counties in China with a high incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis. Currently, there are approximately 25,000 pulmonary tuberculosis patients in the county. Since last October, there has been a severe shortage of anti-tuberculosis drugs in my county, failing to meet the needs of the numerous patients seeking treatment. It is understood that there are few domestic manufacturers producing anti-tuberculosis drugs, and due to the high production costs and low profits, most manufacturers are unwilling to produce them.

I appeal to the relevant departments to consider the plight of tuberculosis patients and to plan the production of more effective anti-tuberculosis drugs.

　　抗痨药物奇缺  苦了结核患者
    我县是全国肺结核病高发县之一。目前，全县有肺结核患者约２．５万人。去年１０月以来，我县抗痨药物奇缺，满足不了众多患者治病的需要。据了解，国内生产抗痨药的厂家不多，加上抗痨药生产成本高，利润微薄，多数厂家不愿意生产。
    呼吁有关部门为结核病患者着想，有计划地多生产一些有效的抗痨药物。
