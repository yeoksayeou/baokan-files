The news reported that the Industrial and Commercial Bureau of Xuchang City in Henan Province investigated a case of official profiteering. A certain leader in the city blamed the bureau for having a "weak commodity consciousness" and dismissed the bureau chief.

Upon hearing this, everyone knew what was going on. The so-called "weak commodity consciousness" was either because the bureau had offended the leader or his relatives, or because the leader was protecting his own people and did not want the scandal to be exposed. Therefore, the bureau chief was dismissed to vent private grievances and prevent future trouble.

After a few years of commodity economy, the term "commodity consciousness" has become quite fashionable, even to the point of being overused. Friends borrowing money with interest is called "commodity consciousness"; eating, drinking, and giving gifts to build relationships is called "commodity consciousness"; enterprises doing things with pomp and circumstance, putting on a show, is said to be for expanding brand awareness, which is also "commodity economic awareness." Even young people getting married and accumulating debt are praised as "leveraged operations" in the commodity economy, and so on.

When "commodity consciousness" becomes a common phrase, its meaning is bound to change. For ordinary people, this is not a big problem. Whether an old lady selling ice cream knows the scientific meaning of "commodity consciousness" is not important; she will still sell ice cream for a fair price. However, for a cadre working in the economy, understanding the accurate meaning of this term is crucial. If the leader misinterprets the scripture, how can the followers not go astray?

Now, when investigating official profiteering and various administrative companies, it is said that they use privileges to buy low and sell high to obtain "high profits," which does not conform to the principle of equal competition in the commodity economy. But weren't they the ones who, under the name of "commodity economic consciousness," hung out their shingle? For example, controlling the scale of investment, some cadres cannot understand: how can you build a factory without investment? How can you develop a commodity economy without a factory? A county magistrate talked about how he values the commodity economy, and his entire basis was that over the past few years, the county invested two billion yuan to set up hundreds of township enterprises. But when a reporter investigated, 80% of them were in a state of loss and semi-suspension. The county magistrate thought that having a factory meant having a commodity economy, but he probably did not understand the difference between products and commodities. Now, emphasizing the separation of government and enterprise, allowing enterprises to become independent commodity operators, does every cadre understand this commodity consciousness? Not necessarily. The examples of enterprises losing money due to administrative intervention are proof of this. As for the "commodity consciousness" mentioned by a certain leader in Xuchang City, Henan Province, it is even further from the original meaning of the term.

Therefore, cadres working in the economy should have a scientific understanding of commodity consciousness. Half-baked knowledge or not seeking to understand thoroughly, or even misinterpreting and mislabeling, will inevitably bring trouble to the rectification and order.

In a time when everyone talks about "commodity consciousness," it is not redundant for people, especially leaders, to have a scientific re-understanding of it.

### “商品意识”之乱弹

　　“商品意识”之乱弹
　　王清宪
    报载，河南许昌市工商局查处一起官倒，市某领导责怪工商局“商品意识淡薄”，免去了工商局局长职务。
    一听这事儿，大家心里就有了数。所谓“商品意识淡薄”，恐怕不是触犯了某领导本人或其亲属利益，就是作领导的护短，不愿外扬家丑。于是，撤工商局长之职，一泄私愤，二防后患。
    商品经济搞了几年，“商品意识”一词，不仅颇为时髦，甚至有些用滥了的味道。朋友间借钱还本付息，叫“商品意识”；吃喝送礼拉关系，称“商品意识”；企业办事讲排场，打肿脸充胖子，说是为扩大知名度，也是“商品经济观念”。就连小青年结婚，债台高筑，也有人誉称为商品经济中的“负债经营”，等等。
    “商品意识”变成一句俗语，其内涵不免要变味。这对老百姓来讲，本无大妨。卖冰棍的老太太知不知道“商品意识”的科学含义不要紧，卖冰棍一分也少收不了。可作为一个从事经济工作的干部，懂不懂这个词的准确含义，问题就大不一样了。领诵的和尚念歪了经，下面怎能不乱套？
    现在，查官倒，查各种行政性公司，说他们靠特权低价进、高价出获取“高额利润”，不符合商品经济平等竞争原则。可当初，他们还不是在所谓“商品经济意识”名义下挂起的牌子？又譬如，控制投资规模，有的干部就想不通，不投资怎么建工厂？没有工厂怎么发展商品经济？某县长谈自己如何重视商品经济，其全部依据是，过去几年里，全县投资两个亿，办起了数百家乡镇企业。可记者一调查，有８０％处在亏损半停产状态。该县长以为有了工厂就有了商品经济，至于产品和商品之间有什么不同，恐怕就不大清楚了。现在强调政企分开，让企业成为独立的商品经营者，这种商品意识，是不是每个干部都认识到了？未必。不少企业因行政干预而亏损的例子就是证明。至于河南许昌市某领导所说的“商品意识”，就和这词的原意差得更远了。
    所以，作为从事经济工作的干部，对商品意识应该有个科学的认识，一知半解或不求甚解，甚至错误地理解，滥贴标签，必然给治理整顿带来麻烦。
    在人人皆谈“商品意识”的今天，人们，尤其是领导干部对它来一次科学的再认识，决非多此一举。
