Superstitious Activities Influence Many Young People

Currently, feudal superstitious activities are on the rise in rural areas and have already affected many young people.

On February 28, farmers in Gangwuang Village, Taiping Township, Pengze County, Jiangxi Province, organized a large-scale superstitious activity to parade statues of Bodhisattvas. Most of the participants were young farmers in their 20s. Along the way, they beat drums and blew horns, set off firecrackers, and carried 100 colorful triangular flags, along with three statues of Bodhisattvas, parading through villages and streets, creating a lively scene. One participant in the parade told me, "The purpose of parading the Bodhisattvas is to ensure peace for the Year of the Snake." Some local officials witnessed the event but did not intervene to stop it.

　　封建迷信活动影响许多青年
    目前，封建迷信活动在农村有所抬头，而且已经影响到许多年轻人。
    ２月２８日，江西彭泽县太平乡港屋王村农民组织了一次游菩萨的大型迷信活动。参加者大多数是２０多岁的青年农民。一路上，他们敲锣吹号，鸣鞭放炮，举着１００面五颜六色的三角旗，抬着３尊菩萨，走乡串村，穿街过巷，热闹非凡。一位游菩萨的参加者告诉我：“游菩萨是为了蛇年太平。”农村一些干部见了，也不出面劝阻。
