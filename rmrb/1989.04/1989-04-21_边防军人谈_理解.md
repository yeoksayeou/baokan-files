I am a border defense soldier. I would like to share my thoughts with you and discuss the issue of "understanding."

In 1979 and 1984, the Sino-Vietnamese border conflicts were intense. Many soldiers sacrificed their blood and lives to defend every inch of our country's territory. The soldiers received understanding and support from society. Several years have passed, and especially in the past two years, there have been no major conflicts on the border. The sentiment of "Long Live Understanding" has faded. This year, during the Spring Festival Gala on television, there wasn't even a single word of greeting for the border soldiers. Dear families, do you know that on this night, the cat-ear caves along the Sino-Vietnamese border were filled with firecrackers? The soldiers held their radios, hoping to hear even just one word of greeting for the soldiers. They would then shout "Long Live Understanding" and light the firecrackers. But the soldiers were disappointed. Here, I quote a segment from a report by a leader stationed at the border to his superiors about combat experiences: "We should not be confused because scientists contribute wisdom, workers contribute products, farmers contribute grain; while soldiers contribute blood and lives!"

Why should we be confused? Because we consciously or unconsciously set an "understanding" expectation for ourselves. Of course, we do not fight for understanding, just as teachers do not stand on the podium for understanding, and sanitation workers do not sweep the streets for understanding. We also do not deny society's understanding of soldiers just because some specific problems have not been resolved. If we insist on getting as much as we give, then the pure battlefield will become a place of transaction. We rise from our confusion because the bloody battlefield does not allow us to solve every person's difficulties before going into battle. It does not allow us to fight only after receiving understanding.

However, in real life, there are indeed many things that contemporary soldiers cannot tolerate, making them feel confused. Look at the experience of a certain platoon leader: When he learned that his young son was run over and killed by a private entrepreneur's car, he hurriedly requested a few days of leave to handle the matter. Unexpectedly, that private entrepreneur was very powerful and settled the matter with a few dollars. At this time, the leave period was approaching, so he had to wipe away his tears and hurriedly rush to Chengdu Railway Station. The tickets for that day had been sold out, so he urgently pleaded with the ticket seller: "I urgently need to return to Laoshan, please help me out." The ticket seller replied with a stern voice: "What Laoshan? We only recognize money, not people."

Moreover, many military cadres find it difficult to get jobs after being transferred back to civilian life, and many problems in the homes of cadres and soldiers that should be solved are not solved. We understand that the country has difficulties and cannot solve all problems at once, but the various injustices that exist in society have hurt the hearts of many cadres and soldiers! Here, I appeal to society: In peacetime, soldiers still need understanding!

### 边防军人谈“理解”

专栏：心里话

　　边防军人谈“理解”
    我是一名边防军人，向你们说说心里话，并顺便谈谈“理解”的问题。
    １９７９年和１９８４年，是中越边界交战激烈的两年，许多战士奉献出鲜血和生命，才保住了祖国的每一寸土地，战士们得到了社会的理解和帮助。几年过去了，特别是近两年来，边境没有大的冲突，当时的“理解万岁”便随之淡漠了。今年电视台的春节联欢晚会上，连一句向边防将士问候的话也没有。亲人们，你们知道吗？这天晚上，中越边界的猫耳洞里，堆满了鞭炮，战士们手不离耳话筒，期望着听到哪怕只有一句问候军人的话，他们便要高呼“理解万岁”，然后点燃爆竹。可是，战士们失望了。这里，我引用一段驻守边防某领导给上级领导汇报作战体会的话，“我们本不应该困惑，因为科学家贡献智慧，工人贡献产品，农民贡献粮食；而军人，就是贡献鲜血和生命！”
    我们为什么要困惑呢？因为我们有意或无意地给自己定了一个“理解”的期望值。当然，我们不是为理解而战，就像教师不是为理解而站讲台，清洁工不是为理解而扫马路一样。我们也不是为某些具体的问题没有解决好就否认社会对军人的理解，如果强求付出多少就要得到多少的话，那纯洁的焦土就会变成交易的场所。我们从困惑中站起，因为流血的战场不允许我们把每个人的任何困难都解决了才去交火，不允许我们在得到理解后才去冲杀。
    然而，在现实生活中，确有不少令当代军人不能容忍的事，使他们感到迷惑。请看某连长的遭遇吧：当他得知幼小的儿子被一个体户驾车违章碾死，急忙请几天假回去处理时。没想到，那个个体户神通广大，赔偿几个钱了事。此时，假期迫近，他只得抹干泪水，匆匆赶往成都火车站。当日的车票已售完，他急切地央求售票员：“我急需返回老山，请照顾一下。”售票员甩出一句硬梆梆的话：“啥子老山嫩山，我们认钱不认人。”
    还有，不少部队干部转业回去工作难安排，不少干部战士家中的问题本应解决却得不到解决。我们理解，国家有难处，不可能一下子解决所有问题，但社会上存在的这样或那样的不平之事，不知伤了多少干部战士的心啊！在此，我要向社会呼吁：和平时期，军人仍需理解！
