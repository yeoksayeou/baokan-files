If, at the first session of the Seventh National People's Congress, representatives focused heavily on the election of new national leaders, then at the second session, the representatives discussed more about how to avoid mistakes in guidance.

The reporter attended some discussions among representatives from various provinces and cities and found a common opinion: to avoid mistakes in guidance, decision-making must be democratized and scientific.

What are the main causes of these mistakes? Representatives analyzed this while reviewing the government work report. Met Ming, a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and deputy director of the Law Committee, spoke at the joint meeting of the Henan delegation and said that the mistakes were due to an impatience for quick results, an insufficient understanding of the arduous and complex process of transitioning from a product economy to a socialist commodity economy. In the process of decentralization and activation, management and supervision were not strengthened in a timely manner, and the macro-control system was not promptly established. More representatives believed that the fundamental cause of mistakes was "the lack of democratic and scientific decision-making on major issues."

At the joint discussion meeting of the Liaoning delegation, Representative Li Jun said, "Why do we always rush for quick results? The root of this 'rush' lies in the lack of scientific analysis of the national conditions and reforms, and the lack of democratization in decision-making. If we can seriously summarize experiences and lessons, and improve the scientific and democratic level of decision-making, we can reduce mistakes."

Zhejiang Representative Han Zhengxiang expressed concern about the imperfections in our current decision-making mechanism. He said, "In recent years, the decision-making on some major issues has been undemocratic and unscientific, leading to some avoidable mistakes. For such a large country, it is not acceptable to make major decisions without thorough consideration."

How to achieve democratic and scientific decision-making? Many representatives expressed the view that a scientific and democratic decision-making mechanism needs to be established.

Representative Luo Zhen Dong from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region said, "When formulating policies related to the national economy and people's livelihood, there should be a correct guiding ideology, as well as a scientific and democratic mechanism."

Zhejiang Representative Zhang Zhenqi said, "The problems in recent years are due to the lack of proper balance between democracy and centralization, leading to work chaos. Policy-making should emphasize democracy and collective wisdom; the implementation of laws and policies should be strict. For example, on the issue of prices, which should be liberalized and which should not, and the potential problems that may arise after liberalization, should be discussed with the public before making decisions."

At the Guangdong delegation's Hong Kong and Macao group, the reporter met with legal expert and member of the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee, Liao Yaozhu. When discussing how to achieve democratic and scientific decision-making, she told the reporter, "To avoid mistakes in decision-making, more experts should be involved in the decision-making process, and the transparency of decision-making should be enhanced, allowing the people to participate in the discussion of decisions."

The degree of democratization and scientific decision-making in China will determine the progress of the Four Modernizations...

　　避免失误：决策的民主化与科学化
    ——七届人大二次会议分组讨论侧记
    本报记者  王谨
    如果说，在七届人大一次会议上，代表们对选举产生国家新的领导人给予极大关注的话，那么，在七届人大二次会议上，代表们议论较多的，则是如何避免指导上的失误问题。
    记者旁听一些省市代表的讨论，几乎获得这样一种普遍的意见：要避免指导上的失误，需要实行决策的民主化与科学化。
    失误的主要原因在哪里？代表们结合审议政府工作报告作了分析。全国人大常委会委员、法律委员会副主任顾明在河南代表团的联组会上发言认为，失误的原因是由于存在急于求成的倾向，对产品经济向社会主义商品经济转变过程的艰巨性和复杂性认识不足。在坚持放权搞活的过程中，未能及时加强管理监督和抓紧建立宏观调控体系。更多的代表则认为，失误的根本原因是“由于对重大问题的决策不民主、不科学造成的”。
    在辽宁代表团的联组讨论会上，李军代表发言说：“我们为什么老是急于求成？‘急’的根子在于对国情和改革缺乏科学的分析，决策缺乏民主化。如能认真总结经验教训，提高决策的科学化与民主化程度，就会减少失误。”
    浙江代表韩祯祥对我国现行的决策机制的不完善表示忧虑。他说：“这几年对一些重大问题的决策不民主不科学，造成了一些本来可以避免的失误。这么大的国家，在作重大决策时，胸中无数是不行的。”
    怎样实现决策的民主化与科学化？不少代表表示这样一种见解：需要建立一种科学、民主的决策机制。
    内蒙古自治区代表罗振东说：“制定有关国计民生的政策，既应有正确的指导思想，又应有科学的、民主的机制。”
    浙江代表张贞契说：“近些年的问题，是民主和集中的关系没有理顺，以致发生了工作上的混乱。制订政策要强调民主，集思广益；执行法律政策，要令行禁止。比如物价问题，到底哪些实行放开，哪些不可以放开，以至放开后，可能会出现的问题，应先听群众的意见，然后再作决策。”
    在广东代表团的港澳组，记者见到法律专家、香港基本法起草委员会委员廖瑶珠。在谈到如何实现决策的民主化、科学化问题时，她对记者说：“决策要避免失误，需要多吸收懂行的人参与决策，同时要增强决策的透明度，让人民参与决策的讨论。”
    中国决策民主化、科学化的程度，决定着四化大业的进程……
