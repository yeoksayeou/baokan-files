Western European Green Party Congress Passes Resolution Calling for Israeli Recognition of Palestine

	PARIS, April 10 (Xinhua) — The Western European Green Party has expressed full support for the establishment of a Palestinian state and the principle of mutual recognition between Palestine and Israel.

	This was announced in a resolution passed at the 5th Congress of the Western European Green Party, held in Paris from April 7 to 9. The congress was attended by over 1,000 representatives from ecological movement organizations in 20 countries, including Western Europe, the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, North America, South America, and Africa.

	The resolution calls on Israel to respond to the Palestinian proposal for substantive dialogue, recognizing the equal rights of the Palestinian and Israeli peoples to achieve national self-determination. It also urges the peace forces in Israel to work towards this goal.

	The resolution further demands that all member states of the European Community recognize the Palestinian state and hold meetings with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. It also believes that the United States should do the same.

    本报巴黎４月１０日电　记者张启华报道：西欧绿党表示完全赞同成立巴勒斯坦国，以及巴以相互承认的原则。
    这是本月７日至９日在巴黎召开的西欧第５届绿党代表大会发表的一项决议宣布的。参加这次大会的有西欧以及应邀前来的苏联、东欧、北美、南美、非洲共２０个国家的１０００多名生态运动组织代表。
    决议呼吁以色列根据巴勒斯坦的建议作出反应，与巴勒斯坦国进行实质性的对话，承认巴以人民在实现民族自治方面享有同样的权利，并要求以色列的和平力量为此进行斗争。
    决议还要求欧洲共同体所有成员国承认巴勒斯坦国，与巴勒斯坦国元首阿拉法特举行会晤，并认为美国方面也应该这样做。
