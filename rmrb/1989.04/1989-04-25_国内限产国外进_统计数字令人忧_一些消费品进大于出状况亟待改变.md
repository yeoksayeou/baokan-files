Due to departmental fragmentation and the lack of effective macro-control measures, some durable consumer goods that have been controlled and limited in domestic production are still being imported in large quantities. The import of processing machinery, whose introduction capacity has already been excessive, also continues despite repeated bans.

Products such as mechanical watches, electronic watches, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, and air conditioners have production capacities that exceed market demand. Last year, the foreign exchange used for importing these products amounted to $14.32 million, while the foreign exchange earned from exporting them was only $1.488 million. This year, mechanical watches, vacuum cleaners, and air conditioners have been listed by the State Council as products subject to strict production restrictions. The domestic sales trend for refrigerators has also significantly slowed, but imports remain unchanged. According to statistics from relevant departments for January of this year, the import of vacuum cleaners is 75 times the export, and the import of refrigerators is 54 times the export.

Leather machinery and food processing machinery, which are part of light industrial machinery, had already been flagged in 1987 by relevant departments as having excessive introduction capacities. However, in 1988, the foreign exchange used for importing these two types of machinery still amounted to $25.564 million, and in January of this year, $2.15 million was spent on imports.

Strictly controlling imports, doing a good job of managing imports, and actively finding ways to expand exports have become important issues in the current efforts to rectify the economic environment.

　　国内限产国外进  统计数字令人忧   
    一些消费品进大于出状况亟待改变
    本报讯  记者刘桂莲报道：由于部门分割，缺乏有力的宏观控制手段，一些国内已控制和限产的耐用消费品却仍然大量进口，引进能力已过剩的加工机械的进口也屡禁不止。
    机械手表、电子表、电冰箱、吸尘器、空调器等产品，我国的生产能力已超过市场需求，去年进口这些产品用汇却高达一万四千三百二十万美元，出口收汇只有一千四百八十八万美元。今年，机械手表、吸尘器、空调器已被国务院列为严格限制生产的产品，电冰箱国内销售趋势已明显趋缓，但进口仍不减。据今年一月份有关部门的统计，吸尘器进口是出口的七十五倍，电冰箱进口是出口的五十四倍。
    制革机械、食品加工机械等轻工机械，一九八七年有关部门已发出引进能力过剩的信号，但一九八八年这两项机械的进口用汇仍高达二万五千五百六十四万美元，今年一月份进口又花去外汇二千一百五十万美元。
    严格把关，搞好进口，积极想办法扩大出口，已成为当前治理经济环境中的一个重要问题。
