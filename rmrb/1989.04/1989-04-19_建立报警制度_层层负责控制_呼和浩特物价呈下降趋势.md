The Hohhot Municipal Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has taken effective measures to stabilize market prices, resulting in a monthly decline in the commodity retail price index since the fourth quarter of last year. The people of all ethnic groups have praised the government for doing a good deed for the common people.

In the latter half of last year, the commodity retail price index in Hohhot rose higher than the national average, causing strong reactions from the public. The Municipal Government held several executive meetings to address the issue and implemented a series of measures to stabilize prices. A price control leading group, composed of the mayor and leaders from relevant departments, meets monthly to study changes in the price index. The group established a price index alert system and broke down the price control index layer by layer, assigning responsibility to individuals. The Municipal Government signed "price management responsibility letters" with 32 departments and units across the city, making the control of the price index an important part of evaluating the performance of leaders at all levels.

In addition, the Municipal Government mobilized the entire society to supervise prices, establishing a nearly 1,000-person price supervision team composed of retired cadres, members of democratic parties, neighborhood committees, and workers. Currently, a price supervision network has been initially formed across the city. The government also published the retail prices of 22 essential daily goods to the public, making the procedures transparent and open to public supervision.

　　建立报警制度　层层负责控制
　　呼和浩特物价呈下降趋势
    新华社呼和浩特４月１９日电　（记者魏友林）内蒙古自治区呼和浩特市人民政府采取有力措施稳定市场物价，使这座城市从去年第四季度以来，商品零售价格指数呈逐月下降趋势。各族群众称赞政府为老百姓办了一件好事。
    去年下半年，呼和浩特市商品零售价格指数上升幅度高于全国平均水平，市民反应强烈。市人民政府为此多次召开常务会议，采取了一系列措施稳定物价。由市长和有关部门领导组成的控制物价领导小组，每月研究一次物价指数变动情况，建立了物价指数报警制度，并把物价控制指数层层分解，责任到人。市政府与全市３２个部门和单位签订了“物价管理责任状”，把控制物价指数情况作为考核各级领导政绩的重要内容。
    除此以外，市政府动员全社会共同监督物价，建立了由离退休老干部、民主党派、街道办事处和职工组成的近千人的物价监督队伍。目前，全市已初步形成了物价监督网络。政府还向全市居民公布了２２种生活必需品的零售价格，做到办事制度公开化，接受市民监督。
