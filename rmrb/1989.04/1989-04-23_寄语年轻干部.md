	Words of Encouragement for Young Cadres
	Secretary of the Jiangxi Yichun Municipal Party Committee, Yè Xuélíng

	In recent years, with the advancement of political system reform, a large number of outstanding young cadres have been selected for leadership positions. They bear the weight of history, embody the hopes of the times, and strive to work hard, achieving results in economic construction and ideological and political work, living up to the trust of the Party and the people.

	However, in the practice of reform, opening up, and economic construction, some young leaders have exposed certain weaknesses, mainly manifested in "three lacks and three shortcomings."

	First, there is a lack of social practice training. Some young leaders, due to their limited social experience, have relatively weak problem-solving abilities compared to older leaders. Especially some "three-door" cadres, lacking the training to handle problems independently, have not experienced any hardships or adversities, and are easily intoxicated by a sense of superiority, viewing work and life as overly simple.

	Second, there is a lack of party training. Some young leaders, due to their short time in the Party, know little about the Party's basic theories and knowledge, have weak political firmness and principles, and have a vague sense of serving the people. Some feel that becoming an "official" makes them superior to others, while some even use their power for personal gain, damaging the image of young leaders.

	Third, there is a lack of leadership artistry. Previously, in the selection of cadres, too much emphasis was placed on professional qualifications and degrees, pushing some young people, especially some technical cadres, into leadership positions, some of whom were promoted out of turn. Their organizational and command abilities do not match their work, making it difficult for some young cadres to oversee the entire situation. Some are only proficient in one field of work but are not good at overall management, often putting them in a passive position.

	Young leaders are the backbone of the youth and the pillars of the country's future. Therefore, actively creating conditions to help young leaders overcome their inherent shortcomings is an important part of leadership team building and a long-term plan for Party building.

	First, we must insist on theoretical study to improve the political quality of young cadres. The change in the positions of young cadres does not mean that their level has also improved. Especially in this great historical turning point, young cadres should learn to use Marxist principles, views, and methods to study and solve new situations and problems that arise during reform and opening up. At the same time, they should pay attention to learning economic theories and professional knowledge to improve their ability to organize and lead the masses in developing socialist commodity economy. They should make time to read more books and think about major issues. Leaders at all levels should also create conditions for young cadres to study, such as through party schools or various training classes, to train young cadres in a systematic and planned manner, improving their theoretical level from all aspects.

	Second, we must insist on party training to improve the self-discipline of young cadres. Young cadres are highly malleable, so it is necessary to strengthen party training, insisting on using party principles, party discipline, and party spirit to regulate and standardize their behavior, establishing a life philosophy and value system of more giving and less taking. Young cadres, regardless of their position or status, should pay attention to whether their behavior is beneficial to maintaining the interests of the Party and the people. When their personal interests conflict with the interests of the Party and the people, they should unconditionally serve the interests of the Party and the state, always adhering to the principle of wholeheartedly serving the people. Especially in the era of reform and opening up, young leaders must prevent the commodification of power, maintain personal integrity, and uphold and carry forward the Party's fine traditions. Those who seek personal gain and benefits in their work, who do not seek real results and benefits, who do not seek contributions but seek high salaries, and who engage in corruption such as using power for personal gain and accepting bribes should be despised by young cadres.

	Third, we must insist on practical training for young cadres to improve their practical work abilities. Any outstanding leader is not born that way but is forged through the hardships of practice. Young cadres will inevitably go through a process of development from immaturity to maturity. "Knowledge gained from books is shallow, true knowledge comes from practice." Young leaders should dare to throw themselves into practice, constantly improving their leadership art. In the past two years, to improve the quality of young cadres, we have insisted on selecting a large number of politically qualified and promising but practically inexperienced middle-aged and young cadres from municipal and county organs and sending them to counties and towns to serve as county and municipal assistants and township and town assistants. At the same time, we encourage young cadres to go to the grassroots level to start and manage township enterprises, allowing a batch of young cadres to be trained, gain experience, and improve their practical work abilities and leadership level.

	"Each generation has its heroes, each leading the fashion for hundreds of years." Young cadres are active in thought and have up-to-date knowledge. Many of them have shown strong pioneering spirit and high standards after taking up leadership positions and have quickly opened up the situation. I am only talking about a few people here. Their inherent shortcomings are inevitable, but it is completely possible to make up for them later. I wish the young cadres of today to brave the waves of reform and opening up, forge ahead, and grow healthily.

　　寄语年轻干部
    中共江西宜春地委书记  叶学龄
    近几年来，随着政治体制改革的推进，一大批优秀年轻干部被选拔到领导岗位上来。他们肩负着历史的重任，寄托着时代的希望，奋发有为，努力工作，在经济建设和思想政治领域的工作中做出了成绩，无愧于党和群众的信赖。
    但是，在改革、开放和经济建设的实践中，一些年轻领导干部也暴露了一些弱点。集中表现为“三短三缺”。
    一是缺少社会实践的锻炼。一部分年轻领导干部由于社会阅历较浅，相对于老的领导干部来说，解决问题的能力较差。特别是一些“三门”干部，缺乏独立处理问题的锻炼，更没有经受过什么艰难困苦或逆境的考验，因而容易陶醉在优越感中，把工作、生活看得过于简单。
    二是缺少党性锻炼。少数年轻领导干部由于入党时间短，对党的基本理论、基本知识知之不多，政治上的坚定性和原则性较差，为人民服务的观念比较淡漠，有些人觉得当上个“官”儿便高人一等，有些人甚至以权谋私，损害了年轻领导干部的形象。
    三是缺少领导艺术。前些时，由于在选拔干部中过分强调专业和学历，把一些从政时间较短的青年，特别是一些专业技术干部推上了领导岗位，有的还是越级提拔上来的，组织指挥能力与工作不适应。一些年轻干部难以总揽全局，有的只懂某一门业务而不善于全面管理，工作往往处于被动地位。
    年轻领导干部是青年的骨干，是国家未来的栋梁，因此，积极创造条件，帮助年轻领导干部补其先天不足，这是领导班子建设的重要内容，也是党的建设的百年大计。
    第一，要坚持理论学习，提高年轻领导干部的政治素质。年轻干部职务的变化，不等于水平也随之提高。特别是处在伟大的历史转折时期，年轻干部更应学会用马克思主义的立场、观点、方法去研究和解决改革开放中出现的新情况、新问题。同时要注重学习经济理论和业务知识，提高组织领导群众发展社会主义有计划的商品经济的本领。挤时间多读点书，思考一些重大问题。各级领导也要为年轻领导干部的学习创造条件，如通过上党校或举办各类培训班，分层次、有计划地培训青年干部，从各个方面提高他们的理论素养。
    第二，要坚持党性锻炼，提高年轻领导干部的自我约束能力。年轻干部可塑性大，因此，必须加强党性的锻炼，坚持用党性、党的原则、党的纪律来约束和规范自己的行为，树立起多奉献少索取的人生观、价值观。年轻干部不管在什么岗位，处在何种地位，都要注意自己的行为是否有利于维护党和人民的利益。当自身利益与党和人民的利益发生矛盾时，要无条件地服从党和国家的利益，始终如一地坚持全心全意为人民服务的宗旨。特别是在改革开放的今天，年轻领导干部一定要防止权力商品化，保持自身的廉洁，保持和发扬党的优良传统。那种在工作中不求实效谋实惠、不求贡献谋优俸的思想行为和以权谋私、贪污受贿等腐败现象，应为年轻领导干部所不齿。
    第三，要坚持让年轻领导干部经受实践锻炼，提高他们的实际工作能力。任何一个卓越的领导干部都不是天生的，而是在实践的艰苦磨练中成长起来的。年轻干部也必然要经历一个从不成熟到成熟的发展过程。“纸上谈来终觉浅，绝知此事要躬行”，年轻领导干部要勇于投身实践中去，不断提高领导艺术。近两年来，我们为了提高青年干部的素质，坚持从地县机关中选拔一大批政治素质好、有培养前途，但缺乏实践锻炼的中青年干部派到县、乡，担任县、市长助理和乡、镇长助理，同时，鼓励青年干部下基层创办、领办乡镇企业，使一批青年干部得到了锻炼，增长了才干，提高了实际工作能力和领导水平。
    “江山代有才人出，各领风骚数百年”。年轻干部思想活跃，知识新鲜。许多人走上领导岗位后表现出极强的开拓精神和很高的水平，很快打开局面。我这里只是针对少数人而言的，他们的先天不足也是难免的，后天补上是完全可能的。愿当代年轻干部在改革开放的大潮中搏击风浪，勇往直前，健康成长。
