Comrade Hu Yaobang loved reading. Comrade Hu Yaobang came from a poor farming family and did not finish middle school. At the age of 14, he joined the Red Army. In the first half of his life, he was always on the move, but he was good at self-study and loved reading. Even on horseback, in trenches, and amidst the sound of gunfire, he could read without putting down his book. In September 1937, when Chairman Mao was in Wayaobao in northern Shaanxi, he praised him for his diligence in reading. When people visited his home, they found that he was either deeply engrossed in reading, thinking about problems, or reading newspapers and magazines, or writing something. When he read classical poetry, famous quotes, and other excellent works, he often memorized and recited them. He could almost recite the entire "Report to Ren An" by Sima Qian.

Comrade Hu Yaobang had a wide range of reading materials, from the classics of Marxism-Leninism to the Four Books and Five Classics, "Zizhi Tongjian," from famous works of Chinese and foreign literature to books by Bernstein, Hitler, Sukarno, and even some small booklets on scientific and technological knowledge, all were within his reading scope. Once, he spent three days reading Nehru's magnum opus "The Discovery of India," excitedly telling his guests, "Nehru is amazing. He had a strong sense of mission even in his youth."

Comrade Hu Yaobang had a lot to say about how to read. He could read extensively and also deeply read some books. He could absorb the nutrients from books and not be constrained by the books, striving to apply what he had learned to his work.

Once, Comrade Hu Yaobang said: "One should read the complete works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, read the Four Books and Five Classics, read all the literary classics of ancient and modern times, and read the Twenty-Four Histories. These books total 50 million words. Even if one reads 10,000 words a day, it would take at least 14 years to finish reading these books. Cadres in their 20s who strive in this direction can become scholars by the time they are around 40."

　　耀邦同志爱读书
    耀邦同志出身于贫寒的农家，初中还没念完，１４岁就参加了红军。前半生戎马倥偬，他善于自修，酷爱读书。他在马背上、战壕里，在枪炮声中，也能手不释卷地读书。１９３７年９月毛主席在陕北瓦窑堡时，曾表扬他能刻苦读书。人们到他家中去时发现，他不是在潜心读书、思考问题，就是在阅读报刊或写些什么。他读书时遇到古典诗文、名人名言等佳作警句，常要强记、背诵一番。司马迁的《报任安书》，他几乎能把全文背下来哩。
    耀邦同志读书的范围很宽，从马列主义经典著作到四书五经，《资治通鉴》，从中外古今名著到伯恩斯坦、希特勒、苏加诺的书，以至一些科学技术知识的小册子，都在他的阅读之列。有一次，他用三天的时间，读完了尼赫鲁的巨著《印度的发现》，兴奋地对客人说：“尼赫鲁这个人了不起，年轻时期就很有事业心。”
    怎样读书，学问不少。耀邦同志既能博览群书，又能精读一些书。既能汲收书中的营养，又不死抠书本，极力把学来的东西，运用到工作中去。
    有一次耀邦同志说：“要读马、恩、列、斯的全集，要读四书五经，要读完古今的文学名著，要读完二十四史。这些书一共有５０００万字，即使一个人一天能读１万字，要读完这些书，至少也得要１４年。２０多岁的干部按照这个方向去努力，到了４０岁左右，可以成为一个学者了”。
