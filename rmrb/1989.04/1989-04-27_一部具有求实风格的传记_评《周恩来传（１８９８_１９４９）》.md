Writing a biography of a historical figure is perhaps the most difficult and important task, as it requires shedding the constraints of reality and emotion to view a person's life trajectory with a more rational and profound historical perspective. The recently published "Zhou Enlai (1898-1949)" edited by Jin Chongji from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's Literature Research Office, breaks away from the common flaws of political biographies, adheres to historical facts, and presents a fair and just evaluation. It is refreshing to read.

Zhou Enlai is one of the long-tested leaders of the Communist Party of China and one of the few individuals who left a significant historical imprint in modern history. His life is closely intertwined with the fate of the entire Chinese nation over an entire era, touching upon all major historical events in the Party's history, and significantly influencing the progress and direction of modern Chinese history. How to present the arduous and tortuous journey of the Chinese revolution and give an objective and fair evaluation of Zhou Enlai's merits and demerits in major issues is both the focus of people's attention and the key to the success or failure of this biography.

It can be said that this biography is successful in its overall grasp of this issue. On the one hand, it fully affirms Zhou Enlai's irreplaceable historical contributions to the Chinese revolution, breaking away from the long-standing "line struggle centralism" thinking and expression in Party history, and striving to give a more appropriate and fair evaluation of Zhou Enlai's historical role in some major issues of the Chinese revolution. On the other hand, it does not shy away from his weaknesses, mistakes, and certain immaturities in specific historical periods, honestly reflecting his thought development process and the tortuous path he took in exploring the Chinese revolution. This realistic spirit permeates the book's commentary on various issues and constitutes the overall style of the entire book.

How to choose one's life path is perhaps the most important choice one makes in life, especially for a revolutionary who seeks truth and is determined to save the country. The book uses a large amount of detailed and vivid historical materials to showcase Zhou Enlai's thought development process. While roughly sketching the era's backdrop of national crisis and national peril, it also closely follows Zhou Enlai's unique experiences from childhood, deeply excavating the various factors influencing his thought evolution, revealing the process of his developing a rebellious psychology of disgust and hatred towards feudal society under the hardships and pressures of life, and gradually fostering a strong sense of crisis. It is this sense of mission to save the nation that drove him to seek the truth to save the country. The book honestly records how, like many patriotic youth at the time, he sought the path to save the country amidst the various prevailing ideologies of the time. He once believed in "industrial salvation," "educational salvation," "moral salvation," and even "sage politics," militarism, anarchism, and during his lonely and desolate journey to Japan, he once turned to Buddhism's "non-birth thought" to seek relief from his inner turmoil. The book does not hide Zhou Enlai's tortuous process of seeking the truth to save the country but uses a passionate pen to write about both the excitement and joy of climbing a thought stage and the confusion and bewilderment of temporarily losing sight of the goal. Behind all this, what people feel more is the young Zhou Enlai's sincere and unremitting pursuit and exploration, and the continuous elevation of his thought realm.

On the scholarly debate about when Zhou Enlai accepted Marxism and established his communist faith, the book, based on solid historical evidence, convincingly answers this question, refuting the "Japanese acceptance theory" and the "May Fourth Movement acceptance theory," and pointing out that even at the beginning of his stay in Europe, he had not yet made a final decision but went through a process of repeated comparison and examination of various ideologies. This highlights Zhou Enlai's cautious character in handling affairs. He was not the kind of person who would make important choices lightly based on momentary emotional impulses. In choosing his faith, as he himself said, he was "full of fear and doubt," with a "nature rich in harmony" and an "extremely strong desire for truth." Under this mental state, when he compared and examined various ideologies, he always saw the duality of problems, repeatedly weighing the pros and cons, and thinking about how to apply them to his nation ("while thinking about how to apply them to our nation," Zhou Enlai's words). His thoughts on Russian-style violent revolution and British-style gradual reform are examples. This comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of "impulsive" and "cautious" once troubled him considerably. Only after he investigated the social reality of Europe and personally experienced the harsh reality of post-war Europe's social misery and crisis did he finally establish his communist faith, and once established, he remained steadfast for life. These thoughts in the process of choosing one's life path, whether "industrial salvation," "educational salvation," or even "cautious" ideas, although ultimately discarded as episodes in the thought development process, were not meaningless but were retained in a sublated form, constituting certain deep structures in Zhou Enlai's thoughts. These were repeatedly manifested in his later political career in various forms.

Evaluating Zhou Enlai's merits and demerits is most difficult and best reflects the author's courage to face historical truth, perhaps in the period of the Second Civil War. During this period, the Communist Party of China led the Chinese revolution through its most arduous and tortuous journey, due to its own theoretical immaturity, experiencing three major "leftist" errors and once falling into a desperate situation. This period was also the early years of Zhou Enlai's nearly fifty years of participation in the core leadership of the CPC Central Committee, and he once served as the actual leader of the CPC Central Committee's work. The Party's immature characteristics during this period were also reflected in Zhou Enlai. He personally experienced the Party's tortuous journey full of setbacks and failures.

The biography neither avoids Zhou Enlai's mistakes during this historical period nor is it objectively recording every event. Instead, it reflects this aspect from the perspective of the Chinese revolution's arduous exploration, incorporating it into the process of the character's gradually deepening understanding and ultimately maturing. The book honestly records Zhou Enlai's drafting of certain instructions, resolutions, and notices for the CPC Central Committee during this period, which contained "leftist" errors, as well as some "leftist" actions. For example, in the Central Committee's No. 70 Notice, he overestimated the revolutionary situation at the time and proposed the current central strategy of four slogans: organizing political strikes, organizing local uprisings, organizing mutinies, and concentrating the Red Army to attack fortified positions. Again, to commemorate the May 30th Movement, he once personally directed a demonstration march with "leftist" adventurism. In the Central Soviet Area, in the absence of effective appeals, he executed the temporary Central Committee's offensive line, attacking Ganzhou, etc. When reflecting on these issues, the book also pays attention to analyzing the historical background and objective and subjective reasons for the formation of errors.

At the same time, the biography devotes more space to detailing Zhou Enlai's significant historical contributions during this period in leading the Chinese revolution. To truly achieve this is not an easy task and also requires the courage to face historical truth, breaking through the shackles of certain traditional concepts. For a long time, under the influence of "leftist" ideology, people seemed to have formed a deeply rooted cognitive inertia: Party history equals the history of line struggles, and if the line is wrong, everything is wrong. Under this extreme logic, the original face of history was distorted, and the Party's arduous efforts before it matured were wiped out. To restore the original face of history, the book cites a large amount of documentary evidence, detailing the work Zhou Enlai did in various aspects in guiding the Chinese revolution's practice after the Sixth Congress, especially with great effort, guiding rural guerrilla warfare in various places, leading the establishment of six major revolutionary base areas and the Red Army, and doing a lot of work in political guidance, organizational training, cadre dispatching, and material support. He helped the Red Army and the Soviet Area overcome the severe difficulties of the initial stage, grow and develop, and become the main symbol of the revolution's revival. He himself gradually formed the recognition of "first having rural Red Army, then having urban power, which is the characteristic of the Chinese revolution" in this practice, contributing his own understanding to the exploration of the Chinese revolution's path.

The book also pays attention to reasonably clarifying historical facts and restoring the original face of history for some issues that have long been misunderstood about Zhou Enlai. For example, the Ningdu Conference issue is a problem that Zhou Enlai has always been severely criticized politically throughout his life and has always been self-reflective. The book cites a large amount of original historical archives, honestly recording the causes and consequences that led to the conference, reflecting that Zhou Enlai, in the debate over the Red Army's operational guidelines, was consistent with Mao Zedong's proposals and strongly advocated that Mao Zedong continue to command the frontline operations. Again, regarding the issue of the Rongming sectarian faction taking power, the traditional view has long been that it was the result of "some comrades who made empiricist errors at the time compromising and supporting them." The book reflects the basic historical process of this issue and also records Zhou Enlai's severe criticism of Rongming and others' unorganized activities in the face of difficult circumstances at the time, and within the possible range, resisted the historical fact of the Communist International supporting Rongming's rise to power. Later, it was only due to the direct intervention of the Communist International and to avoid the Party's split in the white terror environment that Zhou Enlai was forced to accept this painful fact. Although he was filled with inner turmoil, he still made every effort to maintain the Party's unity, persuading Party members with different opinions to avoid a major split in the Party. The book fully affirms Zhou Enlai's great efforts in "considering the overall situation and tolerating for the Party" to maintain the Party's unity and points out: The history of the Communist Party of China has experienced many great storms internally, with serious disagreements and disputes, but the Party has never split and has always corrected errors within the Party. This has important significance for the Party's development and the achievement of democratic revolution victory. It should be said that Zhou Enlai's contributions in this aspect are invaluable.

The biography also uses thick ink to reflect on some major historical events in which Zhou Enlai played an important role and some issues that have long been overlooked by Party history but indeed reflect Zhou Enlai's characteristics and achievements. The former includes the Nanchang Uprising, the Xi'an Incident, and the negotiations between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, while the latter includes the white area work during the Second Civil War, correcting the expansion of the rectification campaign in the Central Soviet Area, the united front work during the War of Resistance, the struggle of the second front during the War of Liberation, and the strategic decisive battle between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang.

Overall, while striving to be faithful to history and give an objective and fair evaluation of Zhou Enlai, the book also has some shortcomings. For example, during the period of Rongming's "leftist" dogmatism, although the book uses a lot of ink to describe the basic historical process, it lacks an overall commentary like the evaluation of the Yangtze River Bureau's work, making people still somewhat unclear about the relationship between the protagonist and the event and the responsibilities that should be borne. Again, on the issue of the Yan'an Rectification Movement, the book, from the perspective of summarizing historical experience, while fully reflecting Zhou Enlai's sincere and profound self-reflection and self-criticism (some of which are excessive), does not point out that during the rectification period, the Party also had some excessive practices in carrying out this correct ideological struggle, often raising the level too high and hurting a part of the Party members. It is precisely because of this practice's later malignant development that history ultimately punished us, and together with other factors, led to the great tragedy of the entire nation. Although the book has these regrets, since history is "an endless dialogue between the present and the past," trying to exhaust all knowledge of it in one go is itself a delusion, and for the author, it is also a demand.

　　一部具有求实风格的传记    
    ——评《周恩来传（１８９８—１９４９）》
    高文谦
    为历史人物写传，最困难然而也是最重要的，或许莫过于摆脱现实和情感的种种羁绊，以更理智、深沉的历史眼光，审视人物一生所走过的轨迹，对其中的功过是非做出客观、公正的评价。新近出版的由中共中央文献研究室金冲及主编的《周恩来传（１８９８—１９４９）》一书，一反以往这类政治传记常有的通病，忠于史实，立论公道，读来令人耳目一新。
    周恩来是中国共产党久经考验的领袖之一，同时也是现代史上在众多方面留下巨大历史印记的少数人物之一。他的一生，与整整一个时代的中华民族的历史命运紧密相关，几乎涉及到了党史上的所有重大历史事件，并在相当程度上影响着整个中国现代史的进程和历史前进的方向。如何在展现中国革命所走过的艰难曲折的历程中，对周恩来在其中一些重大问题上的功过是非，做出客观公正的评价，这既是人们最为关注的焦点，也是这部传记成败的关键。
    应该说，这部传记对这个问题在总体的把握上是成功的。书中一方面充分肯定了周恩来为中国革命所做出的不可磨灭的历史功绩，突破了党史上长期习用的“路线斗争中心论”的思维模式和表达方式，力求对周恩来在中国革命一些重大问题上的历史作用，重新给以更恰当的公正的评价。另一方面，也不回避他的某些弱点、失误乃至一定历史阶段上的若干不成熟之处，如实地反映其思想发展的过程和为探索中国革命所走过的曲折道路。这种求实精神贯穿于书中对各种问题的评述之中，并构成了全书的整体风格。
    如何选择人生道路，这是每个人一生中面临无数次选择中最重要的一次，对于一个追求真理、矢志救国的革命者来说，尤其如此。书中运用大量翔实、生动的史料，展示了周恩来思想发展的历程。在粗笔勾勒当时国难深重、民族危亡的时代大背景的同时，又紧紧围绕周恩来从童年时起的独特经历，深入挖掘影响其思想演变的各种因素，揭示了周恩来在生活的磨难和重压下，对封建社会产生厌恶和憎恨的叛逆心理，并且逐步萌生强烈忧患意识的过程。正是这种拯救民族危亡的使命感促使他走上寻求救国真理的道路。书中如实地记述了他同当时许多热血青年一样，为了寻找救国的道路，在当时流行的各种思潮中卷来卷去。他曾经相信过“实业救国”、“教育救国”、“道德救国”乃至“贤人政治”、军国主义、无政府主义，甚至在东渡日本的孤苦寂寞中一度转向佛教的“无生思想”，以求得到内心苦闷的解脱。书中没有讳言周恩来在寻求救国真理中的这些曲折过程，而是用饱含激情的笔，既写出了当攀登上某一思想台阶后的兴奋和欣喜，也写出了暂时失落目标后的彷徨和迷惘，而在这些背后，使人们更多感受到的则是年轻的周恩来所进行的真诚不懈的追求和探索，是他思想境界的不断升华。
    在周恩来何时接受马克思主义、确立共产主义信仰这一学术界看法不一的问题上，书中根据确凿的史料，令人信服地回答了这一问题，否认了“日本接受说”和“五四运动接受说”，同时指出，就是在旅欧之初，也并未最后下定决心，又经过了对各种主义反复推求比较的过程。在这一点上，突出地表现了周恩来的临事审慎的思想性格特色。他不是那种单凭一时的情绪冲动，就会轻率做出重大选择的人。在选择信仰的问题上，用他自己的话说是“多畏多虑”，“天性富于调和”，“求真的心又极盛”。正是在这种心态的支配下，所以当他对各种主义进行推求比较的时候，总是看到问题的两重性，反复比较权衡其中的利弊得失，“而思所以应用之于吾民族间者”（周恩来语）。他对俄国式的暴力革命和英国式的渐进改革的思考，就是例证。这一“躁进”之说与“稳健”之说优劣的比较，曾一度相当困扰过他。只是当他考察了欧洲的社会实况，亲身感受到当时战后欧洲社会饥寒交迫、危机四伏的严酷现实，从而对西方文明尚存的一丝幻想破灭之后，才最终确立了共产主义的信仰，并且一经认定，终生不渝。这些在选择人生道路过程中的思考，“实业救国”也罢，“教育救国”也罢，甚而至于“稳健”之说，尽管作为思想发展过程中的一个个插曲，最终被抛弃了，但也决不是毫无意义的，而是以扬弃的方式，保留了其中的合理成分，构成了周恩来思想中某些深层结构的东西，并且在其日后的政治生涯中一再以这样或那样的形式顽强地表现出来。
    评价周恩来的功过是非，难度最大同时也最能看出作者面对历史真实的勇气的，恐怕要算第二次国内革命战争时期这一段。这期间，中国共产党领导中国革命走过了最艰难曲折的一段路程，由于自身思想上理论上的不成熟性，连续发生了三次全局性的“左”倾错误，并曾一度陷入绝境。而这段时间也是周恩来一生近五十年参与中共中央核心领导的最初的几个年头，并曾一度是中共中央实际工作的主持者。党在这一时期尚未成熟的特点，同样也在周恩来身上表现出来。他亲身经历了党这一段充满挫折和失败的曲折历程。
    对此，传记中既没有讳言周恩来在这一历史时期的某些失误，也并非客观主义地有事必录，而是从对中国革命艰辛探索的角度，纳入人物思想认识逐步深化，并且最终走向成熟的过程中来反映这方面的内容。书中如实地记述了周恩来在此期间为中共中央起草的某些指示、决议、通告中带有“左”倾错误的内容，以及一些“左”的行动。如他起草的中央七十号通告中，过高地估计了当时的革命形势，提出目前中心策略的四大口号：组织政治罢工、组织地方暴动、组织兵变、集中红军攻坚。再如，为纪念五卅运动，他曾亲自指挥过带有“左”倾冒险行动的示威游行。又如，在中央苏区，在申诉无效的情况下，执行了临时中央的进攻路线，攻打过赣州，等等。书中在反映这类问题时，也注意了分析形成错误的历史背景和主客观原因。
    与此同时，传记以更大的篇幅，详述了周恩来在此期间参与领导中国革命所做出的重大历史功绩。要真正做到这一点并非一件易事，同样需要面对历史真实的勇气，冲破某些传统观念束缚的樊篱。长期以来，在“左”的思想影响下，人们似乎形成了这样一个根深蒂固的思维定势：党史等于路线斗争史，而路线错了，一切皆错。在这种极端的逻辑下，历史的本来面目被歪曲了，党在走向成熟之前所进行的艰苦卓绝的努力被一笔抹杀了。为了恢复历史的本来面貌，书中引用了大量的文献史料，详细评述了党的六大后，作为中共中央工作实际主持者的周恩来，在指导中国革命的实践中所做的各方面工作，特别是以极大的努力，指导各地农村游击战争，领导创建了六大区域的革命根据地和工农红军，在政治指导、组织培训、干部输送和物资支援等方面，做了大量的工作，帮助红军和苏区战胜了初创阶段的严重困难，并壮大发展起来，成为革命开始复兴的主要标志。他自己则在这一实践中，逐渐形成了“先有农村红军，后有城市政权，这是中国革命特征”的认识，为探索中国革命的道路问题，贡献了自己的一份认识。
    对于周恩来的一些长期以来被误解的问题，书中也注意有分寸地澄清史实，恢复历史的本来面貌。如宁都会议问题，这是周恩来一生中始终在政治上受到严重指责，自己也总是检讨不已的问题。书中引用大量原始的历史档案，如实地记述了导致会议发生的前因后果，反映了周恩来在那场围绕红军行动方针的争论中，和毛泽东的主张是一致的，并力主毛泽东继续留在前方指挥作战。又如王明教条宗派上台的问题，长期以来传统的看法是由于“当时中央一部分犯经验主义错误的同志对于他们实行妥协和支持”的结果。对此，书中既反映了这一问题的基本历史过程，也记述了当时处境困难的周恩来对王明等人非组织活动的严厉批评，并在尽可能的范围内抵制了共产国际扶持王明上台的历史事实。后来只是由于共产国际的直接干预，同时为了避免在白色恐怖环境下党的分裂，周恩来才被迫接受了这一痛苦的事实。其后尽管他内心充满着苦闷，但仍竭力维护党的团结，说服党内不同意见的同志，避免了党的一次重大分裂。书中充分肯定了周恩来这种“顾全大局，相忍为党”，为了维护党的团结所做出的巨大努力，并且指出：中国共产党历史上在内部曾经历过多次巨大的风波，出现过严重的分歧和纠纷，但党始终没有分裂，总是在党的内部纠正错误。这对党的发展和民主革命胜利的取得，有着重要的意义。应该说，周恩来在这一方面是功不可没的。
    传记中对于一些周恩来在其中扮演重要角色的重大历史事件，和一些长期以来被党史所忽略而又确实体现周恩来特色并且卓有建树的问题，也运用浓墨重笔加以反映。前者如南昌起义、西安事变、国共谈判等，后者如第二次国内革命战争时期的白区工作、纠正中央苏区的肃反扩大化、抗战时期的统战工作、解放战争时期的第二条战线的斗争、国共两党的战略决战等。
    总观全书，在力求忠实于历史、客观公正评价周恩来的同时，也存在着某些不足。如在王明“左”倾教条主义统治时期，书中虽然用了不少笔墨叙述了基本历史过程，但缺少一种像评价长江局工作那样的整体性评述，使人们读后仍对传主与其中的关系究竟如何，对此应负哪些责任，多少有些若明若暗之感。再如在延安整风问题上，书中从总结历史经验的角度，在充分反映周恩来作出的诚恳、深刻的反省和自我批评（其中有些是过头的）的同时，没有点出整风期间党内在开展这种正确的思想斗争的过程中，也存在某些过火的做法，往往上纲过高，伤害了党内一部分同志。而正是由于这种做法在以后的恶性发展，历史最终地惩罚了我们，在和其他因素的共同作用下，导致了那场整个民族的大悲剧。书中虽然存在着这些遗憾，但是历史既然是作为“现在和过去之间无终止的对话”，那么，试图一次就穷尽对它的全部认识，这种想法本身就是一种奢望，对作者来说，也是一种苛求。
