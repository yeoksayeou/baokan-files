After Two Rounds of the Fujitsu Cup, Ma Xiaochun and Liu Xiaoguang Advance to the Top Eight

    The second round of the second Fujitsu Cup Go Championship saw three top-tier players from Japan—Nie Weiping, Kobayashi Koichi, and Kato Masao—suffer defeats, losing their chances to advance to the top eight. This news caused a stir at the Japanese Go Association today. Chinese players Ma Xiaochun and Liu Xiaoguang both won their matches and advanced to the third round.

    Today's results were as follows: Nie Weiping lost to Wang Mingyuan of Taiwan by half a point, Kobayashi Koichi lost to Cho Hunhyun of South Korea by seven and a half points, Kato Masao lost to Seo Bongsoo of South Korea by four and a half points, Ma Xiaochun defeated Japanese player Tanroku Shuzo by half a point, Liu Xiaoguang defeated Japanese player Cho Chikun in the middle of the game, Japanese player Takei Jōhachi defeated Chinese player Qian Yuping in the middle of the game, and Japanese player Rin Kaiho defeated Chinese player Liang Weitang in the middle of the game. Nie Weiping's loss to Wang Mingyuan was surprising to experts. In the first half, Wang Mingyuan had a slight advantage. Entering the middle game, Wang Mingyuan played a questionable move, and Nie Weiping made a mistake in handling a crucial stone, ultimately losing by half a point.
