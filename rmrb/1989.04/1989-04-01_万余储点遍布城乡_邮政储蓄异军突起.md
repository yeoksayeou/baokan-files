Over 10,000 savings points spread across urban and rural areas: Postal savings emerges as a strong contender

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 31st: Reporters Zhang Guo Rong and Yao Xiao Min report: The postal savings system, which has been in operation for three years, has developed rapidly. The current savings balance has reached 7.3 billion yuan, with nearly 14,000 service points spread across urban and rural areas. In terms of the number of service points, it ranks only behind the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China. The funds accumulated by postal savings have been incorporated into the national credit plan and are beginning to play a role in stabilizing the economy and the financial system.

	The postal savings system was established on April 1, 1986, expanding the channels for absorbing social funds.
