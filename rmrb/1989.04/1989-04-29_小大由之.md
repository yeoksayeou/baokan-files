"When the door is open, the atmosphere is tense, but when the door is closed, it feels quite comfortable." This is a comment from some workers about their satisfaction with their unit. The statement is quite thought-provoking.

The macro environment constrains the micro environment of an enterprise. But can the micro climate of an enterprise influence the macro environment? The answers to this question are quite varied.

One viewpoint is: "One hand cannot turn the tide." Everything can only wait or observe until the macro environment is rectified, and then proceed to rectify the micro environment. Some even think that since the macro environment has certain disorders, I should "follow the prescription." A worker in a factory in Tianjin, who is deaf and mute, gestured to his superiors to complain about problems by mimicking drinking, staggering, and throwing and wiping actions. His meaning was: The factory director drinks and eats extravagantly every day, and the workers casually throw away the silk tubes, wasting them. The factory director that the deaf-mute worker exposed is usually full of discontent and complaints. In fact, that was just a cover for his own reckless behavior. This kind of behavior, which complains about the macro environment on one hand and takes advantage of the chaos on the other, is naturally inferior to those who are merely pessimistic and do nothing.

Another viewpoint is that although an enterprise cannot control or change the negative factors in the macro environment such as price increases, unfair distribution, and improper practices, it can at least practice self-restraint to reduce and avoid adding to the chaos in the macro environment; at the same time, it should strive to create a micro climate that is conducive to the development of the enterprise and makes the workers united and harmonious. The ancient saying goes: "Cultivate oneself, regulate the family, govern the state, and pacify the world." Governing the state and pacifying the world is difficult, but cultivating oneself and regulating the family should be achievable, right?

The micro climate of an enterprise is composed of various factors, involving economic conditions, political environment, ideological emotions, cultural atmosphere, and so on. But the main factor is still people. There is a famous saying in Tianjin: "Take the masses' emotions as the first signal for work." Zhang Shilou, the creator of the collective management method, did just that. He used every means to guide the masses to establish a community of shared interests and hardships, fully tap into the potential of each individual, and quickly turn around a long-loss-making enterprise. Tianjin City has promoted his experience to all enterprises in the city. People feel that although large, medium, and small enterprises each have their own characteristics, the idea of establishing a community of shared interests can benefit all, and has already produced results in a number of enterprises.

Who says the micro environment has no influence on the macro environment?

　　小大由之
    肖荻
    “开开门气不打一处来，关上门心里还挺痛快。”这是一些职工对本单位尚称满意的一句评语。这话很有滋味可咂。
    大环境制约着企业的小环境。那么，一个企业的小气候是否对大环境有所影响呢？对此答案颇为不一。
    一种观点：“只手难挽狂澜”，一切只好等待或观望大环境治理好了，再来治理小环境。有的甚至认为，大环境既然存在某些混乱，那我也“照方抓药”。天津市一家企业有位聋哑职工，找上级反映问题时作饮酒状、脚步踉跄状和抛物、擦屁股状。其意思是说：厂长成天大吃大喝，职工们把纱管随便乱扔，浪费掉了。聋哑人所揭发的这位厂长，平时愤世嫉俗，牢骚满腹。其实那正是掩盖自己的放浪形骸。这种一边抱怨大环境，一边混水摸鱼的行为，比之仅仅悲观失望无所作为，自然又等而下之了。
    另外一种观点，认为作为一个企业虽然无力左右或改变大环境中物价上涨、分配不公、风气不正等消极因素，但本身起码可作到自我约束，以减少和避免为大环境“添乱”；同时，应尽可能创造一个有利于企业发展、让职工心齐气顺的小气候。古语不是说：修身、齐家、治国、平天下吗？治国、平天下难，修身、齐家总该可以作到吧？
    一个企业的小气候是由多种因素汇成，涉及经济条件、政治环境、思想情绪、文化气氛等等。但主体还是人。天津有句名言：把群众情绪作为工作的第一信号。群体经营工作法的创造者张世纶就是这样作的，他千方百计引导群众建立有福同享、有难同当的利益共同体，充分发挥每个人的内在潜力，迅速使多年亏损的企业有了起色。天津市已把他的经验推向全市各企业。人们感到虽然大中小企业各有特色，但建立利益共同体的思路都能有所收益，并已经在一批企业里产生实效。
    谁说小环境对大环境没有影响呢？
