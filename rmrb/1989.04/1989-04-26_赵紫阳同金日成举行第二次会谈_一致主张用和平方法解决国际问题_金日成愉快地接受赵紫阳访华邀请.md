Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 26th.

General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, Zhao Ziyang, and General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, Kim Il-sung, held their second talks this morning at the Baekhwawon State Guesthouse. Both sides expressed satisfaction with the results of the talks.

Kim Il-sung highly praised China's adherence to reform and opening up, and the four cardinal principles, and the significant achievements made in socialist construction. He also commended China's insistence on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, saying, "This principle is very good."

Zhao Ziyang emphasized that Kim Il-sung's proposal to achieve Korean reunification through a federal system is a realistic path to national reunification. He noted that the United States is a party to the Korean issue and, to ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula and create conditions for Korea's independent and peaceful reunification, he hoped that the United States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea would engage in serious dialogue and elevate the level of dialogue.

At the beginning of the talks, Kim Il-sung thanked Zhao Ziyang for the detailed introduction of China's situation and views on the international situation during their first meeting the previous day. Kim Il-sung then introduced the efforts of the Korean people, under the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea, to carry out the three revolutions of ideology, technology, and culture, and to strive for the realization of the Third Seven-Year Plan. He also discussed the situation on the Korean Peninsula and the North-South dialogue, and expounded on the Workers' Party of Korea and the government's stance on the North-South dialogue and the efforts made for national reunification.

Kim Il-sung stressed that the federal system is the best solution for Korea's independent and peaceful reunification. He reiterated the demand for the United States to gradually withdraw its troops from South Korea to facilitate Korean reunification and expressed gratitude to the Chinese Party and government for their consistent support and sympathy in Korea's struggle for national reunification.

In discussing the international situation, Kim Il-sung said, "Our views are consistent. We believe that dialogue is better than confrontation, and relaxation is better than tension. We need a peaceful and stable environment to carry out socialist construction. In the current international situation, we advocate solving problems through peaceful means."

Zhao Ziyang praised the Korean people's spirit of struggle under the leadership of Chairman Kim Il-sung and the Workers' Party of Korea for achieving the grand goal of industrial, agricultural, and technological modernization. He expressed sincere joy and congratulations on the achievements made by the Korean people in socialist construction. He said that achieving Korea's independent and peaceful reunification is the common aspiration of all Koreans. He reiterated that the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people will always support the Korean people's struggle for national reunification.

Zhao Ziyang said that since last year, the Workers' Party of Korea and the government have proposed a comprehensive peace plan and various reasonable initiatives for national reunification, all of which we firmly support. We hope that three-party talks between North Korea, South Korea, and the United States can be realized.

Regarding the arrest of Mun Ik-hwan by the South Korean authorities, Zhao Ziyang said that to create a good atmosphere for North-South dialogue, the South Korean authorities should release Mun Ik-hwan.

Finally, Zhao Ziyang sincerely invited Kim Il-sung to visit China at his convenience. Kim Il-sung happily accepted the invitation.
