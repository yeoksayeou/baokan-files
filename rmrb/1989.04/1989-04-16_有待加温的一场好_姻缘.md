A Promising Match Awaiting Warmth

Reporter Xiao Di

The reduction of arable land and the urgency of grain fields have brought new challenges to the ancient brick-making industry.

Should we develop new building materials?

The investment is high, and the consumption of cement and steel is also high, so the land consumption is large. Therefore, the traditional bricks and tiles that consume a lot of land still account for 90% of wall materials. Every year, 40 billion bricks are produced, consuming 800 million cubic meters of land. If this continues, how can we sustain it?

Tianjin City and its suburbs have more than 380 brick factories, producing about 6 billion bricks annually, consuming approximately 12 million cubic meters of land, severely depleting the land. Meanwhile, as the city at the confluence of nine rivers, Tianjin faces annual silting due to upstream water changes, resulting in severe river silting. Between the three sluices of the Haihe River, 10 million cubic meters of silt need to be dredged annually. The Yongding New River has over 15 million cubic meters of silt. River silting reduces the flood discharge capacity by 59%, requiring huge sums of money to dredge every flood season. Utilizing river silt for brick-making is an inexhaustible resource.

Tianjin Mayor Li Ruihuan has repeatedly raised this issue. The Tianjin Building Materials Bureau has conducted two special investigations and written feasibility reports, proposing to build a brick factory on each side of the industrial zone downstream of the Haihe River.

The Dongfeng Brick Factory, which has exhausted its soil resources, began using Haihe River silt to make bricks as early as 1964. After production, the product quality quickly reached the national standard, with good physical and chemical properties. By last year, it had consumed 2.34 million cubic meters of Haihe silt, producing 7.2 billion clay bricks, with a product qualification rate of 94%, and the supply is insufficient. This has saved 1,170 acres of farmland.

Following this, several other state-owned brick factories in Tianjin have also begun studying the use of silt from the Duliqiao River, Yongding New River, and Ziya River for brick-making.

However, these plans have encountered various obstacles and have been difficult to implement.

The main difficulty is that, taking the Haihe River as an example, known as "nine dragons managing water," it is administratively divided among six or seven bureaus under central and local governments, managing water conservancy, port affairs, navigation, transportation, public utilities, etc. Dredging and blowing silt, occupying land, each cubic meter of soil requires one bureau to pay another 10 yuan, and another bureau to pass through the sluice and release water, requiring another payment to a third bureau. Many riverbed silts have been cultivated for farming, and using the silt requires corresponding compensation. The multi-faceted interests, the segmented accounts, like a basket of crabs, mutually restrain each other, making it difficult to move. The brick and tile industry is known as the "candle" industry with minimal profits, with each brick selling for only 8 fen, not enough to buy an ice cream stick, and it is impossible to afford the large amount of blowing silt water required to purchase silt.

However, one thing is clear. Utilizing river silt for brick-making is a great thing that relates to the rational use of national land resources, benefits navigation, flood discharge, water storage, and the treatment of three wastes. Saving farmland is an urgent issue. With the support of relevant central departments, coordinated by the Tianjin Municipal Government to facilitate this matter, it seems inevitable. It calls for consensus, coordination, and synergy among all parties, and its experience will benefit the whole situation.

### 有待加温的一场好“姻缘”

　　有待加温的一场好“姻缘”
    本报记者　肖荻
    耕地锐减，粮田告急。这给取土烧砖这一古老行业带来了新的困窘。
    发展新型建材吗？
    投资大、水泥钢材消耗高，因此耗土量大的秦砖汉瓦迄今仍占墙体材料的９０％，全国每年要为烧制４０００亿块砖而吞掉８亿立方米土地，如此下去，何以为继？
    天津市区及郊县共有砖厂３８０多座，年产约６０亿块砖，耗土约１２００多万方，对土地构成一种严重蚕食，一些砖厂已土源枯竭。与此同时，作为九河下稍的天津，由于上游水情变化而形成年年淤、河河淤，仅海河的三闸之间每年要清淤１００万方土。永定新河淤泥达１５００多万方。河道淤塞使泄洪能力下降５９％，每年汛期不得不花费巨资清淤。利用淤泥烧砖，可谓取之不尽，用之不竭。
    天津市长李瑞环多次提出这个问题。天津建材局两次组织专题考察，写出可行性调研报告，建议在海河下游工业区两岸各建砖厂一座。
    土源已经枯竭的东风砖厂早在１９６４年即试用海河淤泥烧砖，投产后产品质量很快达到部颁标准，物理、化学性能良好。截至去年累计已吃掉海河泥２３４万立方米，生产出７．２亿块粘土砖，产品合格率达９４％，供不应求。此举累计节约农田１１７０多亩。
    继之，天津市其它五六个国营砖厂也都纷纷着手研究利用独流碱河、永定新河、子牙河等河道淤泥烧砖的问题。
    可是，这些计划遇到种种碰撞，竟难以落实。
    突出的困难是，以海河而论，号称“九龙治水”，在体制上分属中央、地方的六七个局，分管水利、港务、航道、交通、公用……清淤吹泥、占地，每方土要由甲局付乙局１０元之多，乙局过闸放水又要付费给丙局。许多河床淤泥上已被开垦种地，动用淤泥势须付出相应赔偿……利益主体的多元化，条块分割的罗圈帐，如同一篓螃蟹，相互钳制，动弹不得。砖瓦行业又是号称“蜡烛”的微利行业，一块砖迄今仅卖８分钱，买不了一根冰棍，根本无力承担购买淤泥所需的大量吹泥水钱。
    但，有一点是清楚的。利用河道淤泥烧砖是关系到国土资源合理利用，有利于航运、泄洪、排蓄水和治理三废的大好事。节约农田是一个刻不容缓的大问题。在中央有关部门支持下，由天津市政府协调各方玉成此事，看来是势在必行。它呼唤有关各方共识、配套、同步，其经验将惠及全局。
