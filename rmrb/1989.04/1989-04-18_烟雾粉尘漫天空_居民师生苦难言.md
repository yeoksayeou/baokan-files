The Nanjing Tire Factory is located in a residential area. The tall chimneys of the factory emit foul-smelling smoke and dust, and the black carbon dust that spreads from the factory is highly toxic, filling the sky. Residents cannot prevent it from entering their homes even with doors and windows closed. Many teachers and students in our school feel nauseous and want to vomit when they smell this odor, making it impossible for them to attend classes.

In 1984, Nanjing No. 50 Middle School, Matai Street Primary School, Matai Street Residential Committee, and our institute successively reported the pollution situation of the Nanjing Tire Factory to the relevant departments, attracting the attention of provincial and municipal leaders. After discussion, the relevant departments decided to start relocating the Nanjing Tire Factory to another place in 1988. However, up to now, there has been no movement in the relocation work of this factory, and the surrounding residents are still surrounded by black smoke.

　　烟雾粉尘漫天空　居民师生苦难言
    南京轮胎厂位于居民区，厂里高大烟囱放出的烟尘气味难闻，厂里飘散出来的黑碳粉尘毒性大，弥漫上空，居民们关闭门窗也无法阻止侵入室内。我校不少师生嗅到这股气味，就恶心欲吐，无法上课。
    一九八四年，南京市第五十中学、马台街小学、马台街居委会和我院等单位先后向有关部门反映南京轮胎厂的污染情况，引起了省市有关领导同志的重视。经研究，有关部门决定于一九八八年开始，将南京轮胎厂迁往别处。但是直到现在，这家工厂的搬迁工作仍无动静，周围群众依然处于乌烟包围之中。
