The grain situation in Yuanping County is urgent and needs to be transported out.

In recent years, our county has had consecutive bumper harvests. Relevant departments, in order to solve the problem of farmers finding it difficult to sell their grain, have actively purchased grain. However, since 1987, due to transportation issues that have not been resolved, the purchased grain cannot be sold or transported out, resulting in a backlog of 6.5 million kilograms, with a total value of 7 million yuan. Some of the grain has been stored for over a year.

Currently, many farmers want to sell their surplus grain to exchange for spring plowing essentials such as fertilizers and production materials. However, since the county has a large amount of grain that cannot be transported out, relevant departments dare not purchase more grain.

　　原平县粮食亟待外运
    近几年来，我县农业连续丰收，有关部门为了解决农民卖粮难的问题，虽然积极收购粮食，但是，一九八七年以来，由于运输问题一直得不到解决，致使收购的粮食推销、调运不出去，现积压已达六百五十万公斤，总值七百万元。部分粮食存放时间已逾一年。
    现在，许多农民要求出售余粮，以便及时换回春耕急需的化肥和生产资料，可县里积压的大量粮食运不出去，有关部门又怎敢收购呢？
