Since Gorbachev's Vladivostok speech, the Soviet Union has adjusted its policy towards the Asia-Pacific region, presenting a much more flexible new attitude in the vast area stretching from the Asian continent in the north to the South Pacific in the south. During this period, the frequency of the Soviet Union's diplomatic and economic activities in the Asia-Pacific region has been unprecedented.

Regarding Japan, the Soviet Union has resumed the periodic consultations between the two countries' foreign ministers, which had been suspended for many years. It no longer insists on the stance that "there is no territorial issue between the Soviet Union and Japan," thereby promoting dialogue between the two countries. In December of last year, when Shevardnadze visited Japan, the two sides discussed the matter of Gorbachev's early visit to Japan and began preparations. Progress has also been made in establishing joint ventures and developing the economies of Siberia and the Far East between the Soviet Union and Japan. In the past, the Soviet foreign minister had always refused to visit Japan, but now they are discussing holding a summit meeting, which is a significant change.

Regarding ASEAN countries and Southeast Asian nations, Soviet diplomatic exchanges have been particularly frequent. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Rozhdestvensky has almost continuously visited ASEAN countries. Leaders of the CPSU Central Committee, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the Soviet government's deputy prime ministers, and foreign ministers have also visited Southeast Asia one after another. Leaders from Thailand, Malaysia, and other countries have also visited the Soviet Union. These diplomatic exchanges focus on discussing the Cambodian issue, expressing the Soviet Union's willingness to improve relations with Southeast Asian countries, and pursuing economic cooperation. Regarding the economic difficulties faced by ASEAN countries, the Soviet Union has also expressed its willingness to provide assistance. Recently, an agreement has been reached to help the Philippines repair its railways.

The Soviet Union has frequently engaged in exchanges with South Korea in a civilian or semi-official capacity to develop economic cooperation. The business communities of both sides have already achieved initial results in negotiations on some development projects and have established offices in each other's countries.

In Sino-Soviet relations, the two sides have conducted multiple rounds of negotiations and consultations to remove obstacles to the normalization of relations, achieving substantial progress. This year, through mutual visits by the two countries' foreign ministers, an agreement has been reached to hold a high-level meeting in May.

The Soviet Union's new attitude in conducting Asia-Pacific diplomacy seems to have two considerations: First, it recognizes that the economy of the Asia-Pacific region is on the rise and has the potential to rival Europe in the world economic landscape by the early 21st century. The Soviet Union has previously focused only on expansion in this region, leading to strained relations with Asia-Pacific countries and making it a weak point in the Soviet Union's foreign relations in both political and economic terms. This needs to be urgently addressed. Second, to promote reforms and develop the eastern economy, a peaceful and stable external environment is necessary to obtain funds, technology, and markets from neighboring countries like Japan, thereby securing a place in the Asia-Pacific economic division of labor.

Compared to the past, the Soviet Union's Asia-Pacific policy has indeed become more flexible. However, its series of carefully planned diplomatic activities seem not to have achieved the expected results. In relations with Japan, the Soviet Union still insists on not changing the post-war established borders, attempting to bypass the territorial issue to develop economic cooperation. Japan, however, insists on resolving the Northern Territories issue before further improving bilateral relations. Due to this deadlock, the two sides have not yet reached an agreement on the date of Gorbachev's visit to Japan. The obstacles to the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations have not yet been completely removed, especially regarding the Cambodian issue. Recently, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Rozhdestvensky stated in Bangkok, "Do not expect the Sino-Soviet high-level meeting to achieve a breakthrough on the Cambodian issue." Does this indicate that the Soviet Union has not yet made a firm decision to push for a quick resolution to this issue? Due to its ambiguous attitude, it is difficult to dispel the suspicions and doubts of ASEAN countries towards it. This will inevitably continue to constrain the development of its relations with ASEAN countries.

Good intentions must be realized through practical actions that align with reality. It seems that the long-term policy the Soviet Union has pursued in the Asia-Pacific region has created a rift between it and the Asia-Pacific countries, which will not be easily resolved. Relying solely on a flexible attitude and persuasive words may not fundamentally improve its relations with Asia-Pacific countries, let alone achieve the "mutually dependent" relationship it claims to establish.

### 苏联亚太外交的新姿态

　　苏联亚太外交的新姿态
    自戈尔巴乔夫发表海参崴讲话以来，苏联调整了对亚太地区的政策，以比过去灵活得多的新姿态，出现在北起亚洲大陆、南至南太平洋的广大地区。这期间，苏联在亚太地区外交经贸活动之频繁，为过去所少见。
    对日本，苏联恢复了中断多年的两国外长定期磋商；不再坚持“苏日之间不存在领土问题”的立场，推动了苏日之间的对话。去年１２月谢瓦尔德纳泽访日时，双方还商讨有关早日实现戈尔巴乔夫访日事项，并着手进行准备。苏日之间在创办合资企业和开发西伯利亚和远东经济方面也取得了一些进展。过去苏联外长一直拒不访日，现在却商量要进行最高级会晤，其转变不能说不大。
    对东盟国家和东南亚各国，苏联外交的穿梭往来，更令人眼花缭乱。苏联副外长罗高寿几乎马不停蹄遍访东盟各国。苏共中央领导人、最高苏维埃主席团副主席、苏联政府副总理、外长等人也接二连三出访东南亚。泰国、马来西亚等领导人也去苏联访问。这些外交往来一是讨论柬埔寨问题，二是表示苏联愿同东南亚国家修好，三是搞经济合作。对东盟国家面临的经济困难，苏联还表示愿意提供帮助。最近，已就帮助菲律宾修复铁路达成协议。
    苏联以民间的或半官半民的形式同南朝鲜频繁交往，以发展经济合作。双方实业界就一些开发项目的会谈已经取得了初步成果，并互设了办事机构。
    在中苏关系方面，双方已就消除两国关系正常化的障碍进行了多次谈判和协商，取得了实质性的进展。今年通过两国外长互访，双方就今年５月举行高级会晤达成协议。
    苏联以新的姿态开展亚太外交，看来有两点考虑：一是看到亚太地区经济正在崛起，有可能在下个世纪初在世界经济格局中与欧洲并驾齐驱，而这一地区过去苏联只注重扩张，引起同亚太各国关系紧张，在政治经济上一直是苏联对外关系的薄弱环节，现在亟需加以弥补；二是为了推行改革和开发东部经济，必须有一个和平稳定的外部环境，才能从日本等邻近国家获得资金、技术和市场，才有可能在亚太经济分工中谋得一席之地。
    苏联的亚太政策较之过去确实有了一些灵活性，但是它的这一系列精心筹划的外交活动似乎没有取得预想的结果。在对日关系上，苏联仍然坚持不能改变战后确定的国界，试图绕开领土问题来发展经济合作。日本则坚持必须先解决北方领土问题然后才能进一步改善两国关系。由于这个死结解不开，双方就戈尔巴乔夫访日的日期至今未能达成协议。中苏关系正常化的障碍至今还没有完全消除，尤其在有关柬埔寨问题上，苏联副外长罗高寿最近在曼谷声称，“不要指望中苏高级会晤能就柬埔寨问题取得突破”。这是不是表明苏联还没有下大决心来促使这个问题尽快合理解决？由于它的这种若暗若明的态度也无法消除东盟国家对它的戒心和疑虑。这势必继续制约着它同东盟国家关系的发展。
    美好的愿望要以符合实际的切实行动来实现。看来，苏联长期在亚太地区推行的政策而形成的它同亚太各国的隔阂，一时还很难消除。只靠灵活的姿态和动听的言词，恐怕也无法从根本上改善它同亚太国家的关系，至于要达到它所宣称的建立的那种“相互依赖”关系，就相差更远了。
