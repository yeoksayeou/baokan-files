	China's population growth rate has shown a serious upward trend in recent years. Since 1986, the natural population growth rate has risen significantly, reaching over 14‰, an increase of 2-3‰ compared to the 1983-1985 period. In terms of absolute natural increase, 1988 saw an addition of over 15 million people, equivalent to the population of Australia.

	Based on the 1988 sample survey of population changes conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics in 614 counties (cities, districts), 2,933 village and residential committees, and 505,800 people, it is estimated that in 1988, the birth rate in mainland China was 20.78‰, the death rate was 6.58‰, and the natural growth rate was 14.2‰. The total population at the end of the year was 1,096,140,000 people. This means that mainland China's population is just 38.6 million short of reaching 1.1 billion. Based on the proportion of births in the first half of the year accounting for 43% of the annual total, it is estimated that the population increases by approximately 37,000 people per day (about 26 people per minute). It is estimated that by around April 14, the mainland population will reach 1.1 billion people. To further raise awareness among all ethnic groups in the country about China's population problem, the State Council approved designating April 14, 1989, as China's "1.1 Billion Population Day" and organizing activities for this day.

	Everyone remembers that the United Nations designated July 11, 1987, as the world's "5 Billion Population Day," holding activities worldwide to remind everyone of the importance of the population issue. Last year, the Asian Parliamentarians Population and Development Forum designated July 1, 1988, as Asia's "3 Billion Population Day," simultaneously holding activities for this day to sound the alarm about rapid population growth in Asia. China is the most populous country in the world, accounting for approximately 22% of the world's population and 36% of Asia's population. China's initiation of the "1.1 Billion Population Day" activities not only raises awareness among the Chinese people about the population issue but also has significant implications for the stability of Asia's and the world's population. As Premier Li Peng pointed out in the government work report of the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress: "All levels of government must fully recognize the necessity and urgency of controlling population growth and combine controlling social total demand with controlling population growth."

	From the perspective of population growth rate, on April 14, 1989, the total population of mainland China reached 1.1 billion (including Taiwan Province and Hong Kong and Macao regions, 1.126 billion people). Compared to the 540 million at the end of 1949, in nearly 40 years since the founding of the nation, China's population has increased by 560 million, a growth of 1.04 times. More notably, with the increase in the population base, the population growth rate will continue to accelerate. From 1840 to 1949, over a period of more than 100 years, China's population only increased by over 100 million. At the current population growth rate, China's population increases by 100 million every six or seven years.

	Rapid population growth has already put immense pressure on China's economic development and improvement of people's living standards. From 1952 to 1988, over 37 years, China's national income increased by 10 times, but per capita income only increased by 4.8 times. The total grain production doubled, but per capita grain availability only increased by 26%. In the past two years, per capita grain availability has slightly decreased, from 394 kilograms in 1984 to 362 kilograms in 1988. Although China's total natural resources rank among the world's highest, per capita resources are below the world average. China's per capita arable land has decreased from 2.8 mu at the founding of the nation to 1.4 mu. The contradiction between population and resources is becoming increasingly prominent.

	Due to the inertia of population growth, in the next 10 years, China will still be in a period of high fertility, with the number of women of childbearing age increasing each year. In 1988, there were 300 million women of childbearing age, which may exceed 330 million by 1995 and reach 340 million by 2000. If population growth is not strictly controlled, rapid population growth will not only affect China's economic prosperity by the end of the century but may also lead to another new fertility peak between 2010 and 2020, placing even greater pressure on future generations. Therefore, the next 10 years are a crucial period for population development, and the task of controlling population growth is extremely arduous.

　　我国人口增长率出现回升趋势
    国家统计局人口司　沈益民　胡英
    近几年来，我国人口增长率出现了严重的回升趋势。自１９８６年以来，人口自然增长率明显回升，达到１４‰以上，比１９８３年至１９８５年的人口自然增长率增加２—３个千分点。从自然增加绝对数看，１９８８年达到１５００多万人，相当于增加一个澳大利亚的人口。
    根据国家统计局１９８８年对全国６１４个县（市、区）２９３３个村民小组和居民小组５０５８００人的人口变动抽样调查结果推算，１９８８年我国大陆人口出生率为２０．７８‰，死亡率为６．５８‰，自然增长率为１４．２‰。年末总人口为１０９６１４万人。也就是说，我国大陆人口差３８６万人就达到１１亿。按上半年出生人数占全年的４３％的比例推算，平均每天大约净增３．７万人（约每分钟增加２６人），估计到４月１４日前后，我国大陆人口将达到１１亿人。为了进一步引起全国各族人民对我国人口问题的高度重视，经国务院批准，将今年４月１４日定为我国“１１亿人口日”，并举办“１１亿人口日”活动。
    大家记得联合国曾将１９８７年７月１１日定为世界“５０亿人口日”，在世界范围内举办了“５０亿人口日”活动，提醒全世界对人口问题的重视。去年，亚洲议员人口和发展论坛曾将１９８８年７月１日定为亚洲“３０亿人口日”，同时举办了亚洲“３０亿人口日”活动，向亚洲各国敲响了人口增长过快的警钟。我国是世界上人口最多的国家，约占世界人口的２２％，亚洲人口的３６％。我国发起“１１亿人口日”活动，不仅能引起全国人民对人口问题的高度重视，而且对亚洲和世界人口的稳定也有着重要意义。正如李鹏总理在七届二次人代会政府工作报告中指出的：“各级政府必须充分认识控制人口增长的必要性和紧迫性，把控制社会总需求和控制人口增长结合起来”。
    从人口增长幅度看，１９８９年４月１４日，我国大陆人口总数达到１１亿（包括台湾省和港澳地区为１１．２６亿人）。同１９４９年底的５．４亿人相比，建国近４０年来，我国人口增加了５．６亿，增长了１．０４倍。更值得注意的是随着人口基数的加大，今后人口数量增长也会不断地加快。自１８４０年到１９４９年的１００多年间，我国人口只增加了１亿多，按目前人口增长速度，我国人口每六、七年就增加１亿。
    人口迅速增长已经对我国的经济发展和人民生活水平提高产生了巨大压力。从１９５２年到１９８８年的３７年，我国国民收入虽然增长了１０倍，但人均收入只增加了４．８倍，粮食总产量虽然翻了一番，但人均占有量仅提高了２６％。近两年人均粮食占有量还有所下降，由１９８４年的３９４公斤下降到１９８８年的３６２公斤。我国自然资源总量虽居世界前列，但人均资源低于世界水平，我国人均耕地由建国初期的２．８亩下降到１．４亩。人口与资源的矛盾愈来愈突出。
    由于人口增长的惯性影响，今后１０年内我国仍处于人口生育高峰期，育龄妇女逐年增多。１９８８年有育龄妇女３亿人，到１９９５年将有可能超过３．３亿人，２０００年可能达到３．４亿人。如果对人口增长不严加控制，人口增长过快，不仅影响本世纪末我国经济繁荣，而且在２０１０—２０２０年之间会导致又一新的生育高峰，给我们的后代造成更大压力。因此，未来１０年是人口发展的重要时期，控制人口增长的任务十分艰巨。
