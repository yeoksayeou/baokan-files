How to Change the Situation of Weak Supervision?

Over the past year, how has the National People's Congress Standing Committee performed in supervising the work of the government and the implementation of laws? How can this supervisory role be strengthened in the future? These were hot topics at the People's Congress. Recently, a reporter from our newspaper, carrying these questions, interviewed Li Guiying, a member of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, the Chairperson of the Yunnan Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, and a female official of the Yi ethnic group.

Q: How do you evaluate the supervisory role of the Standing Committee over the past year?

A: Over the past year, the Standing Committee has focused more on legislative work, and the achievements are quite notable. However, in comparison, the supervisory function has indeed not been fully utilized. In the past year, seven sessions of the Standing Committee were held, and I attended five of them. Basically, all of them were discussions on legislative issues, and a total of 13 laws were determined. Currently, the public has strong opinions about economic overheating, price increases, inflation, and corruption within party and government agencies. If the Standing Committee, while accelerating legislative work, also strengthens supervision over the government, courts, and procuratorates, it would be possible to avoid or reduce mistakes. For example, after the People's Congress annually reviews the national economic plan, the Standing Committee should, according to the resolutions of the Congress, regularly check whether the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Finance, and other government departments have implemented the resolutions' guidelines, rather than waiting for a year to do a comprehensive review. For major decisions like price reforms and issuing more currency, the Standing Committee has the responsibility to discuss and review them in a timely manner.

Many committee members have also realized this issue. Many comrades say that the main problem in the past was the lack of laws to rely on, but now it is the lack of strict enforcement and weak supervision.

I believe that supervision is not only support and promotion for the government but also a constraint. Deepening reforms and rectification both need the legal supervision and work supervision of the Standing Committee as a guarantee. This is a long-term task that needs to be continuously improved and gradually perfected in practice.

Q: Where should we start to strengthen supervision?

A: First, we need to strengthen investigations and research. Only by having a clearer understanding of the actual situations of various ministries, provinces, and grassroots levels can effective supervision be implemented. To this end, we need to change the randomness and general nature of committee inspections. We should organize committee members to conduct targeted and focused investigations based on the resolutions of the People's Congress and the major issues of each period, analyze the problems, and propose solutions. Solving two or three problems within a year would be quite good.

The Standing Committee has 74% of its members belonging to various specialized committees. The role of these specialized committees is to play the role of the Standing Committee. The role of these committees has been strengthened in recent years, but they still need to do more in assisting the Standing Committee to understand the situation and supervise work.

Q: Some representatives suggest transferring the Supervision Bureau and the Audit Office from the government series to the People's Congress series. What do you think?

A: The People's Congress cannot handle the vast and complex specific audit work. The nature of the People's Congress determines that its supervision should be macro and comprehensive, rather than getting bogged down in specific matters that should be managed by the government. Of course, for major projects like the Three Gorges Project that are of great significance, the People's Congress should still be involved.

According to the powers granted by the Constitution to the People's Congress, the People's Congress itself is a supervisory body, and it is not reasonable to set up a specialized supervisory body under it. The role of the People's Congress is supervision, and the Supervision Bureau and the Audit Office should perform their functions and assist the Standing Committee in implementing supervision through various specialized committees.

Q: Some representatives believe that the age structure of the Standing Committee is no longer suitable for supervisory work. What do you think?

A: The Standing Committee needs to both legislate and supervise, and it is not possible without a group of highly respected, high-thinking, and experienced older comrades. At the same time, it also needs a group of young and energetic cadres. The age of the Standing Committee should be a stepped structure. From the current situation, it can be said that the age is somewhat high.

　　如何改变监督不力状况？
    本报记者  朱维群
    过去的一年中，全国人大常委会对政府工作和法律实施方面的监督作用发挥得怎样？今后如何强化这一作用？这是人代会上的一个热门话题。近日记者带着这些问题采访了全国人大常委会委员、云南省人大常委会主任、彝族女干部李桂英。
    问：您怎样评价这一年中人大常委会的监督作用？
    答：这一年来人大常委会抓立法工作比较多，成绩也比较显著，但是相比之下，监督职能的确发挥不够。一年中，共召开７次常委会，我参加了５次，基本上都是讨论立法问题，共确定了１３项法律。目前群众对经济过热、物价上涨、通货膨胀以及党政机关中的腐败现象意见很大。如果人大常委会在加紧立法工作的同时，也加强对政府和法院检察院的监督，就有可能避免或减少失误。比如，在人代会一年一度审议国民经济年度计划之后，常委会应当根据大会决议，经常性检查计委、财政部等政府部门是否按决议的方针办了，而不要等一年后再来个总回顾。像物价改革、增发票子这样的重大决策，人大常委会有责任及时进行讨论、审议。
    对这个问题，常委们也意识到了。很多同志讲，过去的主要问题是无法可依，现在是执法不严，监督不力。
    我认为，监督既是对政府的支持、促进，无疑也是制约。深化改革和治理整顿，都需要人大常委会法律监督和工作监督的保障。这是一项长期任务，需要在实践中不断改进、逐步完善。
    问：加强监督应当从何入手？
    答：首先要加强调查研究。只有对各部委、各省以及基层的实际情况比较清楚了，才可能实行有效的监督。为此，要改变委员视察的随意性和泛泛视察的状况。应当根据人代会的决议和每个时期突出的重大问题，组织委员有目标、有重点地集中调查，对问题进行分析，提出解决的办法。一年内能解决两、三个问题就算不错了。
    人大常委会有７４％的委员分属各专门委员会。发挥各专门委员会的作用，也就是发挥常委会的作用。各委员会作用近年有所加强，但是在协助常委会了解情况、监督工作方面做得还不够。
    问：有些代表建议将监察部和审计署从政府系列划归人大系列，您怎样看？
    答：人大不可能去应付庞大、繁杂的具体审计工作。人大的性质决定它的监督应当是宏观的、总体性的，而不宜陷于本应由政府管理的具体事务中。当然，像三峡工程这样事关大局的建设项目，人大还是应当管的。
    根据宪法赋予人大的权力，人大本身就是监督机构，下面再设专门监督机构于理说不通。人大的作用是监督，监察部、审计署发挥职能，同时通过各专门委员会协助常委会实施监督。
    问：有些代表认为人大常委会的年龄结构已不适应监督工作，您怎样看？
    答：人大常委会又要立法，又要监督，没有一批德高望重、思想水平高、经验丰富的老同志是不行的。同时也要有一批年富力强、精力充沛的干部。常委会的年龄应当是梯形结构。从目前情况看，应当说年龄是偏高了一些。
