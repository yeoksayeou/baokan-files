Yunnan resolutely punishes "official speculators"

Over 600 major and significant cases have been handled

Some "official speculators" are still protected and investigations are obstructed

According to Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, April 25 (Reporter Li Yuanda) Yunnan Province has identified 818 major and significant cases during the rectification and cleanup of companies. Of these, 661 cases have been handled. The province has helped units recover 132 million yuan in goods payments, assisted banks in recovering 305.2 million yuan in loans, and imposed 70.3 million yuan in fines. A total of 1,100 individuals involved in these cases have been dealt with accordingly.

In the process of rectifying and improving the economic environment, the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have focused on rectifying and improving the circulation environment and establishing a new circulation order. They have strengthened the investigation and punishment of both large and small speculators. In particular, during the cleanup and rectification of companies, Yunnan Province has targeted "official speculators" as key objects for investigation and punishment. Currently, the province has investigated and punished 79 cases of illegal profiteering exceeding 100,000 yuan. Among these, 19 cases involved illegal profits of 100,000 to 500,000 yuan or more. In addition to confiscating the illegal gains, the relevant personnel have been handed over to judicial authorities for criminal prosecution.

From 1985 to September of last year, the Yunnan Building Materials Supply Company converted 10,123 tons of planned, subsidized steel into negotiated-priced steel and "allocated" it to lower-level units within the system, resulting in illegal and disciplinary violations amounting to 57.4 million yuan and illegal profits of 12 million yuan. The Yunnan Smelting Plant, under the pretext of exchanging production raw materials, obtained 98.5 tons of planned, subsidized aluminum ingots from the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Corporation and sold them at a markup to the Kunming Materials Trading Center Operations Department, earning 137,600 yuan in illegal profits. Later, this batch of aluminum ingots was resold three times without being moved from the warehouse, yet the price per ton increased by 309.5 yuan. During this cleanup, their illegal income was completely confiscated.

However, some "official speculators" and "big speculators" are still protected by local governments and officials, with some cases being investigated but not punished, and others not being investigated at all. In a certain region in southern Yunnan, some counties' departments have been bulk-selling timber and white sugar. After the industrial and commercial administrative department investigated and verified the facts, the local government, for the sake of local interests, did not allow the industrial and commercial administrative department to issue a handling document. In a certain county in northeastern Yunnan, a responsible person from a grassroots supply and marketing cooperative made 6 million yuan in profits from selling cigarettes. However, the local government evaluated this supply and marketing cooperative responsible person as an "excellent entrepreneur" and did not allow the industrial and commercial administrative department to investigate and punish them. Some local government leaders have "money in their eyes but no law," believing that as long as money is made for the locality, it is considered legal.

### 云南坚决惩处“官倒”  六百多起大案要案已作出处理  有些“官倒”至今受到庇护查处受阻

　　云南坚决惩处“官倒”    
    六百多起大案要案已作出处理    
    有些“官倒”至今受到庇护查处受阻
    据新华社昆明４月２５日电（记者刘远达）云南省在整顿清理公司中查出大案要案８１８起，已有６６１件作了处理。帮助单位追回货款１３２０多万元，协助银行追回贷款３０５２万元，罚款７０３万元。这些案件涉及到的１１００多人，已分别作了处理。
    在整顿治理经济环境中，云南省委、省政府把整顿治理流通环境、建立新的流通秩序作为重点，加强了对大小倒爷的查处。特别是在清理、整顿公司中，云南省对“官倒”作为重点对象组织力量查处。目前，全省查处了非法牟利万元以上的７９起。其中，牟利１０万元至５０万元以上的１９起，除没收非法所得外，有关当事人员已移交司法机关追究刑事责任。
    云南省建材供应公司从１９８５年至去年９月，将计划内平价钢材１０１２３吨转为议价，“调拨”给本系统内基层单位，违法违纪金额达５７４万元，非法牟利１２０万元。云南冶炼厂以串换生产原料为理由，向中国有色金属工业总公司要到计划内平价铝锭９８．５吨，加价转卖给昆明物资贸易中心经营部，从中牟利１３．７６万元。以后这批铝锭又被３次加价转卖，而铝锭在库房并未挪动一步，每吨价格却涨了３０９．５元。在这次清理中，他们的非法收入被全部没收。
    然而至今仍有一些“官倒”、“大倒”由于当地地方政府和“父母官”的庇护，有的查而不处，有的则不让查。滇南某地区一些县有的部门大量倒卖木材、白糖，工商行政管理部门查清后，当地政府为了本地利益，不让工商行政管理部门下达处理文件。滇东北某县一个基层供销社负责人倒卖卷烟牟利６０万元，当地政府却把这个供销社负责人评为“优秀企业家”，不让工商行政管理部门查处。有的地方政府领导人眼里有“钱”无“法”，只要给当地赚了钱就认为合法。
