The news that "Huangmei Opera is facing a crisis" was revealed in this newspaper in early March, causing a stir in Anhui.

Vice Governor Shao An told readers: To address the urgent needs of the Anhui Huangmei Opera Theater, the provincial government has decided to allocate an additional 1 million yuan to complete the construction of the rehearsal rooms and to purchase some urgently needed equipment. Previously, Vice Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee Yang Yongliang and Standing Committee Member and Propaganda Department Director Niu Xiaomei visited the theater, witnessed its current state, felt deeply remorseful, and wrote a long letter to the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government. They proposed three measures: First, suggest that leaders at all levels truly regard the revival of Huangmei Opera as an urgent matter; second, suggest accelerating the theater's reforms, introducing a competitive mechanism, and ending the practice of everyone eating from the same big pot; third, give a little "heart stimulant" (referring to the additional funding), then seek cooperation between the theater and factories, and strive for social support. This letter has attracted attention from all sides. However, to fundamentally solve the crisis, it seems there will still be some pain to endure.

　　安徽挽救黄梅戏
　　省府追加拨款一百万元
    本报合肥电　记者张振国报道：“黄梅戏面临危机”的消息于３月初在本报披露之后，在安徽引起震动。
    副省长邵明日前告诉读者：为解决省黄梅剧院燃眉之急，省府决定追加拨款一百万元，解决练功房的续建和一些急需设备的的添置等。在此之前，省委副书记杨永良，常委、宣传部长牛小梅曾到该院作了调查，目睹剧院现状，深感内疚，并向省委、省府写了一份长信，提出三条措施：一是建议各级领导真正把振兴黄梅戏作为一件刻不容缓的要事来抓；二是建议加快剧院体改，引入竞争机制，绑在一起吃“大锅饭”的现状再也不能继续下去了；三是先打一点“强心针”（指追加拨款），再寻找院厂挂钩，争取社会支持。这封信已引起各方关注。但要根本解决危机，看来还有一番阵痛。
