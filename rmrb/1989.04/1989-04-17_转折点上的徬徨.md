Title: Hesitation at the Turning Point

U.S. domestic and international public opinion has been increasingly critical of the Bush administration's failure to produce a comprehensive foreign policy. Now, the U.S. government has finally put forward three principles for its diplomacy, but it still lacks a comprehensive foreign policy.

On April 14, U.S. Secretary of State Baker announced that the three principles guiding U.S. foreign policy would be: maintaining U.S. leadership, realism, and bipartisan cooperation. Using three principles of diplomacy to replace a comprehensive explanation of foreign policy is likely to disappoint those with high expectations.

Foreign policy is a country's overall policy on international politics and relations, formulated by its government based on strategic goals in global affairs and a thorough analysis of the international situation. Diplomacy is just one of the means to implement this overall policy. Therefore, Baker's three diplomatic principles cannot be said to equate to U.S. foreign policy. The well-informed *U.S. News & World Report* in its April 17 issue, which was published early, referred to the upcoming Bush administration's foreign policy as the "Bush method of handling foreign policy," which seems quite appropriate.

It is understandable that the Bush administration finds it difficult to produce a comprehensive foreign policy. The world situation is now at a major turning point. Old concepts in international politics and relations are gradually being replaced by new ones, old power configurations are giving way to new ones, and the importance of economic factors is increasingly surpassing military might. Under these circumstances, many factors have emerged that the U.S. finds hard to fathom, making it difficult to make quick decisions and resulting in a state of hesitation at the turning point.

For the U.S., the biggest question is how the internal and external policies of the other superpower, the Soviet Union, will develop. However, what troubles the U.S. even more is the growing divergence within the Western alliance in assessing the situation and policy changes in the new context. This is the real threat to U.S. "leadership." Now, whether it is in short-range missile modernization in Western Europe, conventional arms reduction in Europe, resolving regional conflicts, or trade issues, the U.S. can no longer reach complete consensus with its allies. This greatly weakens the position of this "leader" in negotiating with the Soviet Union. No wonder a close aide to President Bush said: "The problem we now face is not one of East-West relations, but of West-West relations." Therefore, even if the first principle of Baker's three principles, which embodies national goals, is to be realized on the surface, the U.S. will probably need to seek compromise with its allies based on considering the interests of all parties, although this is not an easy or pleasant task.

However, the author believes that the Bush administration's intention to pursue pragmatic diplomacy both domestically and internationally is worthy of recognition. Cautious and pragmatic diplomacy can avoid major failures and prevent international tensions. The drawback, as *U.S. News & World Report* magazine points out, is the lack of direction. "The car has been bought, and the engine has been tuned. But where is the map?" A map with the correct direction will be available, but it will probably take some time after the U.S. conducts a comprehensive review of its post-war foreign policy.

### 转折点上的徬徨

　　转折点上的徬徨
    美国国内外舆论对于布什政府一直未能拿出一个全面的对外政策，近来颇有烦言。现在美国政府终于拿出来一个外交政策三原则，但是仍然没有一个全面的对外政策。
    美国国务卿贝克４月１４日宣布，今后美国外交政策的三点原则是：继续保持美国的领导地位、现实主义和美国两党的通力合作。用外交政策三原则来代替关于对外政策的全面阐述，恐怕不免要使那些期望甚高的人感到失望。
    对外政策是一国政府根据本国在世界事务中的战略目标和对国际形势的周密分析而制订的关于国际政治和国际关系的总政策，外交只是推行这一总政策的手段之一。因此，贝克宣布的外交三原则，很难说等于美国的对外政策。消息灵通的《美国新闻与世界报道》在提前出版的４月１７日一期中把将要推出的布什政府的对外政策称为“处理对外政策的布什工作方法”，这倒是颇为恰当的。
    布什政府难以拿出一个全面的对外政策，是可以理解的。世界形势现在正处在重大的转折关头，国际政治和国际关系中旧的观念正在逐渐被新的观念所取代，旧的力量组合正在让位于新的力量组合，经济因素的重要性正日益显示出其超越军事实力的重要性。在这种情况下，出现了许多使美国捉摸不定的因素，因而难以迅速作出决策，形成了在转折点上徬徨不定的局面。
    对于美国来说，另一个超级大国苏联内外政策将如何发展，固然是一个最大的问题，但是更使美国头痛的是新形势下西方盟国内部在形势估计和政策演变上分歧的日益扩大。因为这才是威胁美国“领导地位”的真正问题所在。现在，无论是在西欧短程导弹现代化、裁减欧洲常规军备、解决地区冲突还是贸易问题等方面，美国已经不可能同盟国取得完全一致意见，这就大大削弱了这位“盟主”同苏联讨价还价的地位。无怪乎布什总统的一位亲信说：“我们现在面临的问题不是东西方关系问题，而是西方关系问题。”所以，贝克三原则的体现国家目标的第一条原则即使要在表面上得到体现，美国恐怕也需要善于和盟国在照顾各方利益基础上谋求妥协，虽然这样做并不轻松愉快。
    但是笔者认为，布什政府打算按照国内国外的实际推行务实主义的外交，这是应该给予评价的。谨慎的务实的外交，既可以避免重大的失败，也可以防止引起国际形势的紧张。缺点是正如《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志所说的：缺乏方向感。“汽车已经买了，发动机已进行了调整。可是地图在哪儿呢？”方向正确的地图会有的，不过恐怕得在美国对战后的对外政策进行全面反思以后。
