Recently, we went to the Bozhou Bus Station to take a public bus to Guantang District. To our surprise, this route had already been discontinued. With no other choice, we had to take a motorized tricycle. Two fellow passengers, who were farmers, told us that in the past two years, it has been very difficult for public buses to enter Guantang. Either the bus windows were smashed, or the tires were punctured. After the public buses stopped running, some people who drive motorized tricycles began to charge exorbitant prices. Each passenger going into the city and returning costs six to seven yuan, which is two to three times more expensive than taking a public bus.

　　路霸垄断客运阻拦客车
    最近，我们来到亳州市汽车站，乘公共汽车去观堂区。没想到，这趟车早就停开了。无奈，我们只好坐上一辆机动三轮车。同车的两位农民告诉我们：这两年公共汽车进观堂可难了，不是车窗玻璃被砸，就是轮胎被人扎破。公共汽车停开后，一些开机动三轮的人便漫天要价，每个乘客进一趟城，往返要花六七元，比乘公共汽车要多花两三倍的钱。
