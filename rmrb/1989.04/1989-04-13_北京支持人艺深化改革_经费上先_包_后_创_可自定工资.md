Recently, the sixth regular meeting of the Beijing Municipal Government discussed the issue of deepening reforms at the Beijing People's Art Theatre. Mayor Chen Xitong said, "The Beijing People's Art Theatre is China's top-tier drama art theatre, with a large number of talented individuals and a very high reputation. All sectors of the city should support the work of the People's Art Theatre, so that the reforms currently underway at the theatre can be deepened and the theatre's work can continue to develop."

Starting from the second half of last year, the Beijing People's Art Theatre, in accordance with the reform pilot plan approved by the municipal government, has taken steps towards reform. First, it implemented the system of director responsibility and the operational contract responsibility system. The theatre has gained a certain degree of autonomy in areas such as performance scheduling, personnel arrangement, ticket price adjustments, wage rewards, and fund utilization. The staff's wages have been restructured into three parts: basic wages, floating wages, and bonuses, which better reflect the principle of paying according to work done and gradually achieve quantitative remuneration and clear rewards and punishments. The actor team divides the annual floating bonus into twelve levels, with the highest being 520 yuan and the lowest 60 yuan. Work quality is reflected in wages with noticeable differences. Additionally, a system of rotating performances between retained plays and newly produced plays has been implemented, and ticket sales methods have been improved.

Chen Xitong fully affirmed the reforms at the Beijing People's Art Theatre, saying, "Reform has made the People's Art Theatre youthful again, and we must continue to reform to ensure it remains youthful forever." Chen Xitong pointed out that for units like the People's Art Theatre, the state should provide key support; in terms of funding, the priority is 'subsidizing' first and then 'creating.' The state must allocate some capital and set up funds to allow them to support themselves, as this is currently not feasible.

When discussing wages and labor remuneration systems, Chen Xitong said that the People's Art Theatre can set its own wage standards. The theatre can decide how to break away from the 'iron rice bowl' system, and the government will not interfere. The government only needs to control it at the macro level. He also proposed expanding the Capital Theatre and building exhibition halls, small theatres, and other facilities.

Shortly after this regular meeting ended, leaders from the Municipal Urban Management Committee, Municipal Construction Commission, Municipal Finance Bureau, Personnel Bureau, and Municipal Planning Institute, along with relevant personnel, went to the People's Art Theatre to discuss and implement solutions for issues such as housing, installation of refrigeration equipment, funding, macro-control of wages, vehicle procurement, and expansion planning, in accordance with the meeting's spirit.

    北京支持人艺深化改革
    经费上先“包”后“创”可自定工资
    本报讯　最近召开的北京市政府第六次常务会议，讨论了北京人民艺术剧院深化改革的问题。陈希同市长说，北京人艺是中国第一流的话剧艺术剧院，有一大批人才，有很高的声望，我们全市各行各业都要支持人艺的工作，使人艺正在进行的改革不断深化，事业不断发展。
    从去年下半年起，北京人艺按照市政府原则通过的改革试点方案迈出改革的步子。首先实行了院长负责制和经营承包责任制，剧院在演出安排、人员组合、调整票价、工资奖励、经费运用等各方面有了一定的自主权。职工工资实行了由基本工资、浮动工资和奖金三部分组成的结构工资制，较好地体现了按劳付酬的原则，并逐步作到量化计酬，奖罚分明。演员队把年终浮动奖金分为十二个档次，最高者520元，最低60元。工作质量体现在工资上有了明显差距。此外还实行了保留剧目与新排剧目的轮换上演制，改进了售票办法。
    陈希同充分肯定了北京人艺的改革，他说：“改革使人艺焕发了青春，还要通过改革使人艺永葆青春”。陈希同指出，对人艺这样的单位，国家要重点扶持；在经费上，首先是“包”，然后才是“创”。国家必须拿出点资本，还要搞一点基金，要他们自己养自己目前是办不到的。
    说到工资和劳动报酬制度时，陈希同说，人艺可以自定工资标准，剧院认为怎样有利于打破大锅饭就怎么定，政府不干涉。政府只在宏观上有个控制就行了。他还倡议扩建首都剧场，并搞陈列馆、小剧场等设施。
    这次常务会议刚结束，市政管理委员会、市建委、市财政局、人事局、市规划院等单位的领导，都按照会议精神亲自带领有关人员到人艺与剧院领导研究落实解决住房问题、冷冻设备安装问题、经费问题、工资宏观控制问题、车辆添置，以及扩建规划等等。
