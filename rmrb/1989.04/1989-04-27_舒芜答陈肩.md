Dear Comrade Chen Jian,

On the evening of February 27th, when my short piece "Listen to Their Words and Observe Their Actions" was published in the *People's Daily*, I received a phone call from you, someone I had never met before. You pointed out that in the poem by Wang Jingwei that I quoted from memory, the third line "柂楼欹侧风正恶" had two incorrect characters and should be "柂楼欹仄风仍恶." I immediately remembered that your correction was entirely accurate. Initially, I thought you were around my age, which is why you would pay attention to and memorize this poem. However, when you told me that you graduated from junior high school in 1986 and are currently working as a doorkeeper and cleaner at the Chinese Culture Academy, and that you love poetry and are diligently self-studying, I was quite surprised. You mentioned that you wanted to write me a letter and send me some of your own classical poetry to read, and I was, of course, very happy. Now, I have received your letter with five poems, which I have read. You asked about "the way of writing poetry and studying," and I am ashamed to say that I have nothing profound to offer, so I can only talk casually.

Your five poems, especially the three elegies for Liang Shuming, are quite mature for someone your age. Lines like "岂知立马燕山日，竟是沉桴沧海时" and "胸有万言书未上，诸君何以答升平" are deeply meaningful and effectively capture Liang Shuming's unique qualities. In my opinion, you have already found your path in poetry. Just continue on this path. Although there are still some aspects that are not fully mature, with enough practice, you will naturally improve. So, what else can I say? I had initially thought that perhaps I could advise you not to stick strictly to the "orthodox" path, but then I remembered that during our phone conversation, you mentioned that you had noticed my articles discussing Nie Gannu's classical poetry and that you had also looked for Nie Gannu's wife, Zhou Ying. This shows that you are interested in Nie's poetry, which is a high point of "heretical" poetry. Therefore, there is no need for me to offer such advice. I just don't fully understand the meaning of "old learning" in your letter. If it is just a casual remark, then it is fine. But if we are being precise, this term might be problematic. Because no matter what subject we study, including classical poetry or even parallel prose, we should approach it with a "new" perspective, using new methods, new references, and new materials. In other words, our approach, methods, references, and materials should all be new, completely new. I have often said that Nie Gannu's poetry is "entering poetry through miscellaneous essays," meaning that he used the lifetime of work of a great miscellaneous essayist to write classical poetry, which is why he achieved such high levels of success. To learn from Nie's poetry, you should start from its source, learn the spirit of the May Fourth Movement, learn the tradition of Lu Xun, learn new poetry (Nie Gannu wrote many new poems in the 1930s), learn the miscellaneous essays of Lu Xun and others including Nie Gannu, and learn Nie Gannu's innovative research on classical literature, among other things, rather than just learning poetry from Nie's poetry. The few poems you sent me give me a slight impression that there is a bit less innovation. Of course, it is easier said than done. I myself can write a few lines of classical poetry, but I have not written for many years because the quality is low, and more importantly, it does not break out of the "orthodox" boundaries, making it uninteresting to me. In a word by Ye Shengtao for *Qinggai Ji* (倾盖集), it says: “Who would want to write in vain, for thousands of years, poetry has been chaotic.” I often take this as a warning. If my poetry has no new ideas, then after thousands of years of poetry, what is the point of adding a few more of mine? However, I am not advising you not to write poetry. My decision to stop writing might just be a passive attitude. I just hope that you do not approach poetry with an "old learning" mindset but rather with a "new learning" approach. Perhaps you used the term "old learning" without much thought, and what I said is already known to you, so let's just consider this a casual conversation!

Sincerely,
Shū Wú

　　舒芜答陈肩

    陈肩同志：
    我的小文《听其言而观其行》在《人民日报》２月２７日发表的当天晚上，我就接到素不相识的您的电话，指出我凭记忆引录的汪精卫那首诗第三句“柂楼欹侧风正恶”有两个字不对，应是“柂楼欹仄风仍恶”。我立刻回忆起来，您的指教是完全对的。起初我以为您的年纪大约同我差不多，才会注意并且记牢这首诗，及至您告诉我，您是１９８６年初中毕业生，现在在中国文化书院做看门扫地的工作，酷爱诗词，努力自学，我不禁大吃一惊。您说要写信给我，寄您自己作的旧体诗给我看，我当然非常高兴。现在，您的信附诗五首，我已经拜读了，承问“作诗及为学之道”，惭愧说不出什么来，只好随便谈谈。
    您的五首诗，特别是挽梁漱溟先生三首，以您的年龄而论，是相当成熟的。诗中如“岂知立马燕山日，竟是沉桴沧海时”，“胸有万言书未上，诸君何以答升平”等句，寄兴深微，足以表现梁漱溟先生的卓特，确是佳句。依我看，您作诗已经上了路，今后这样走下去就行了，现在虽然也还有未全成熟之处，功夫到了自然成了。那么我还有什么可说呢？本来我还想，或者可以劝您不要专走“正统”一路，但是又想起您电话中告诉我说，您曾注意到我谈聂绀弩的旧体诗的几篇文章，而且您也找过聂绀弩夫人周颖大姐，足见您对聂诗是有兴趣的，而聂诗乃是“异端”诗的高峰，那么我要奉劝的话也是不必说的了。我只不太了解您信中所说您“现在既习西文，亦研旧学”的意思，不知所谓“旧学”是在什么意义上说的。如果一般随便说说，固无不可。但如果抠字眼起来，则这个词恐有语病。因为我们现在，不管做任何学问，包括做旧体诗，甚至哪怕是做骈体文，都应该是“新学”，不应该是“旧学”。就是说，我们的眼光，方法，取经，取材，……都应该是新的，完全新的。我多次说过聂绀弩是“以杂文入诗”，就是说，他是以大杂文家毕生的功夫来做旧体诗，所以才达到那样高的成就。要学聂诗，就要从它的源头写起，学“五四”精神，学鲁迅传统，学新诗（聂绀弩３０年代写过不少新诗），学鲁迅以下包括聂绀弩在内的诸大家的杂文，学聂绀弩对古典文学的处处有新意的研究，等等，而不是只就聂诗学聂诗。您寄来的几首诗，我微微感到，创新的成份稍稍少一些。当然这话说来容易，做起来不容易。我自己也会做几句旧诗，但已多年搁笔，就因为做出来的东西水平固然很低，尤其是一点没有越出“正统”的藩篱，自己看了也没有意思。叶圣陶先生题《倾盖集》的词中有云：“谁愿操觚妄作，几千载，诗已纷纭。”我常常当作警钟来听。我作诗若毫无新意，则几千年那么多的诗之后，又何需多出我的几首来呢？但是话说回来，我决不是劝您不作诗。我之搁笔也许只是消极的态度，我只是希望您不要以“旧学”去学作诗，而要从“新学”的道路去学罢了。也许您用“旧学”二字全无深意，我说的全是您已经知道的，那就作为随便谈谈吧！
