Title: Deng Weizhi on: Who is the First Stratum?

Deng Weizhi argues that today's first stratum in China is the intellectuals.

He believes that a class or stratum that represents advanced social productive forces is an advanced class or stratum. Using this criterion to measure intellectuals, who have a unique mode of labor, one can see that in every period of technological history, it is intellectuals who have blazed the trail. This is especially true in today's era of accelerating technological development. Intellectuals are the carriers of advanced technology and advanced management methods, and are undoubtedly the representatives of advanced productive forces. Science and technology are the primary productive forces, and scientific workers are the representatives of the primary productive forces. In this sense, intellectuals are the first stratum.

From the perspective of class attributes and class characteristics, the class that is most selfless is the class that best represents socialist public ownership and can become the most advanced class. In the primary stage of socialism, selflessness cannot be universally practiced among all members of society, but selflessness remains the highest moral standard in the primary stage of socialism. In a sense, intellectuals are "bare." What intellectuals possess is knowledge. The difference between knowledge and other material resources is that material resources are tangible and can be moved from one place to another, resulting in more here and less there, or none there. However, knowledge is intangible and does not decrease with dissemination and exchange. This is called the shared nature of knowledge. The shared nature of knowledge fundamentally determines the selflessness of the intellectual stratum, whose profession is to possess and create knowledge. Therefore, from this point of view, the intellectual stratum should undoubtedly be the advanced stratum that is compatible with socialist public ownership, the first stratum.

### 邓伟志谈：谁是第一阶层？

　　邓伟志谈：谁是第一阶层？
    邓伟志撰文提出，今日中国的第一阶层是知识分子。
    他认为，某一个阶级、阶层代表了先进的社会生产力，就是先进的阶级、阶层。用这把尺子量一量具有独特劳动方式的知识分子，可以看到在技术史的每个时期，都是知识分子开的先河。在科技加速度发展的今天尤其是如此。知识分子是先进技术、先进管理方法的载体，无疑地是先进生产力的代表者。科技是第一生产力，科学工作者也就是第一生产力的代表者。从这个意义上说，知识分子就是第一阶层。
    从阶层属性、阶级特征看，哪个阶级最无私，哪个阶级才最能代表社会主义公有制，才能成为最先进的阶级。在社会主义初级阶段，无私固然不能在全体社会成员中普及，但是，无私依然是社会主义初级阶段的最高道德规范。从某种角度上讲，知识分子是“赤条条”的。知识分子所富有的是知识。知识同其他物质资料的不同之处在于：物质资料是有形的，会因空间的移动而出现此多彼少，此无彼有。可是知识是无形的，不会因传播、交流而减少。这就叫知识的共享性。知识的这种共享性，从根本上说，决定了以占有和创造知识为职业的知识分子阶层的无私性。因此，从这一点上看，知识分子阶层无疑地应该是同社会主义公有制相适应的先进阶层、第一阶层。
