Recently, foreign media reported that the coastal open city of Yantai's reform experiment allowing private home purchases has been temporarily suspended due to economic tightening. This statement is not accurate. Du Shicheng, the deputy mayor overseeing government work in Yantai, recently told a reporter from this newspaper that since Yantai's housing reform entered the "real conversion" phase last November 1, progress has been smooth. As of now, the city has sold 1,707 new and old homes to individuals, totaling 102,000 square meters, with a sales revenue of 17.49 million yuan. The public's enthusiasm for purchasing homes continues to grow. Statistics show that over 4,000 households want to buy new homes, and more than 10,000 households want to buy old homes. The city has also established three levels of housing funds: city, unit, and individual, accumulating nearly 1.2 billion yuan.

It is understood that Yantai's policy allowing private home purchases remains unchanged. The current difficulty is the shortage of housing supply. To solve the problem of housing construction funding, while implementing "real conversion," housing funds for cities, units, and individuals have been established. Unit and individual housing funds are all stored in the housing savings bank. By the end of March, corporate deposits had reached 105.83 million yuan, savings deposits 12.34 million yuan, and construction loans 126 million yuan, with deposits and loans basically balanced.

This year, Yantai's housing reform will accelerate and fully expand. The "real conversion" scope will expand from 4 cities, counties, and districts to 11 cities, counties, and districts. Housing subsidies will gradually be included in wages, completing the adjustment of cost rent, making housing construction tend towards a virtuous cycle, and actively creating conditions for the transition to housing commercialization. Relevant officials in Yantai believe that to achieve this goal, it is inseparable from the supporting reforms of the financial system, credit structure, and wage system, and it is impossible to "achieve it all at once."

### 烟台市房改步伐加快  群众购房势头有增无减

　　烟台市房改步伐加快
    群众购房势头有增无减
    本报烟台４月２３日电  记者王锦鹄报道：最近，有外电报道海滨开放城市烟台实行允许私人买房的改革试验因经济紧缩而暂时中断。这一说法并不确切。烟台市主持政府工作的副市长杜世成日前在接受本报记者采访时说，烟台房改自去年１１月１日全面进入“实转”阶段后，进展顺利。截至目前，全市已向个人售出新旧住房１７０７套，计１０．２万平方米，售房金额达１７４９万元。群众要求购房的势头仍有增无减。据统计，需购新房的有４０００余户，需购旧房的达１万多户。全市还建立了城市、单位、个人三级住房基金，已集聚资金近１．２亿元。
    据了解，烟台市允许私人购房政策不变。目前困难主要是房源不足。为了解决住房建设资金来源，在“实转”的同时，设立了城市、单位、个人住房基金。单位和个人住房基金一律在住房储蓄银行存储。到３月底，企业存款已达１０５８３万元，储蓄存款达１２３４万元，建房贷款１２６００万元，存贷基本平衡。
    今年烟台房改将加快步伐，全面推开。“实转”范围从４个市、县、区扩大到１１个市、县、区，住房补贴将逐步进入工资，完成成本租金调整，使住宅建设趋向良性循环，积极创造条件向住宅商品化过渡。烟台市有关人士认为，要实现这一目标，离不开财政体制、信贷结构和工资制度的配套改革，不可能“一步到位”。
