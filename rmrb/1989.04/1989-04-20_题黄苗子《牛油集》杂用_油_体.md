	On the Use of "Oil" in Huang Miaozi's "Cow Oil Collection"
	Chen Di Dong

	Do you recall the days when "索伊" was sought after?
	Bowing down to the great calligraphy of Mo Qing.
	I have seen his poetic style with little "oil,"
	When I first came to "芳家园."

	Recently, he has been playing with rhymes, deceiving two Cao Caos,
	Writing poems with cunning, observing resentment as well.
	With杂文 and yellow cartoons, do not mistake them for "打油诗."
	Yu Jia Bo and Yu Ji are like poets,
	Attracting the Prince of Xiangshan.
	Painting the beautiful sentences of Fuchun River,
	Miao Gong is indeed a good match.
	Sometimes laughing, sometimes crying without reason,
	One, two, initial, three, nine, all safe and sound.
	At night, the sound of commerce precedes the cicadas,
	The autumn rain on the ginkgo trees is always lingering.

　　题黄苗子《牛油集》杂用“油”体
    陈迩冬
    昔年记得“索伊”①无？拜倒墨卿大
    　隶书。
    曾见诗风油味少，“芳家园”②里我
    　来初。
    近来逗韵两曹瞒，狡狯为诗怨亦观③。
    聂以杂文黄漫画，诸君莫作打油看。
    郁家伯季拟诗王④，招得香山驸马郎。
    点染富春江句美，苗公不愧好东床。
    时而啼笑两无端，一二初三九平安⑤。
    夜月商声先蟋蟀，梧桐秋雨总绵缠。
    注：①苗子向余索伊秉绶（墨卿）书白鹤山石刻拓片。②苗子旧居。③孔子论诗有兴、观、群、怨之说。④谓郁曼陀、达夫兄弟。⑤苗子有句：“一二平安九”。
