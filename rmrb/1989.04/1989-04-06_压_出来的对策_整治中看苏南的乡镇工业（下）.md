The industrial townships of Suzhou are facing a severe test and also have the opportunity to improve.

The "Hot" Trend of Spreading Out Cools Down

In the spring of 1986, when banks were tightening credit and reducing the scale of construction projects, the most striking impression Suzhou left on me was a widely circulated whisper: "They can suppress others, but they can't suppress us. When they go down, we go up." Under this mindset, the fixed asset investment of Suzhou's township enterprises did not slow down at all. Now, people have tasted the bitterness and admit that there is indeed a problem of "overheating" in spreading out.

In the past four years, Suzhou and Wuxi have each invested an average of 100 million yuan annually to spread out and carry out technological transformations, while their annual profits are only about 500 million yuan. Even if the depreciation of original assets is added, it still does not reach 100 million yuan. The excessive investment in fixed assets, on the one hand, increases the burden of loan and borrowing interest for enterprises, and on the other hand, makes the already tight working capital even more insufficient.

This time, the tightening has made enterprises reluctant to complain. Some villages that started late are even more snowed under. For example, in Xinzhen Town, Yixing City, 10 new projects were launched last year with a total investment of over 40 million yuan. Now, the debt is piling up, with loans and borrowings totaling 63 million yuan, while the self-owned working capital is only 4 million yuan. Six completed enterprises cannot operate normally, and four that are not yet completed cannot be finished.

Reality has made people sober up. The reporter has heard many times that this time we cannot take chances and must solidly strengthen our "internal skills."

Warnings from Mistakes

Suzhou has over 20 years of experience in developing township enterprises, and major mistakes in project selection are rare. However, the "hot" trend of latex gloves last year has given people a new warning.

Due to the need to prevent AIDS, the international market saw a surge in demand for latex gloves starting from the second half of the previous year. Some foreign merchants and domestic trading departments, with orders in hand, sought purchases everywhere, claiming that they would accept any grade, even substandard products. Several enterprises producing similar products immediately switched production and quickly made a lot of money. Thus, the trend of "large-scale production" suddenly emerged. Zhangjiagang City launched 80 production lines, and a town in Kunshan County even launched 22 lines.

Facing this "hot wave," the Suzhou Municipal Bureau of Township Enterprises quickly surveyed the international market situation and issued a warning in March of last year. However, some places were in the midst of excitement and were unwilling to brake suddenly. In just over a year, Suzhou's townships and towns suddenly had 180 latex glove production lines. Just a few months later, the market situation changed drastically. Some production lines had not even been installed when the buyer's market turned into a seller's market. The main consuming country, the United States, on the one hand, invested in factories in Southeast Asia, the source of raw materials, and on the other hand, raised the import standards for products. The merchants who had previously pledged to accept all products disappeared, and a large number of gloves were piled up in warehouses and ports, unable to be sold.

It is reported that currently, these 180 production lines have only about one-third that have recovered their investment, while the rest can only operate intermittently, and some cannot operate at all.

A farmer entrepreneur said: This mistake was made because we did not study the international market well. For an export-oriented economy, relying on our previous experience of dealing with changes in the domestic market is far from enough.

Strategies Born Out of Pressure

Implementing shareholding system. To solve the problem of insufficient working capital and to mobilize all employees to work together to overcome difficulties, Suzhou City started to promote the shareholding system with a fundraising nature in township enterprises at the end of last year (only new funds raised for shares pay dividends and interest), and carried out pilot work on a more complete shareholding system (original assets are also converted into shares, participating in dividends together with new shares).

Mergers and decentralization. Suzhou also has some loss-making or marginally profitable enterprises. However, because "both sides of the hand are flesh," no one can bear to close or merge them. Now, the crisis forces people to make choices, guiding each township and village to carry out mergers, auctions, and decentralization, promoting enterprises to move towards those with better benefits, and products to move towards low-energy, low-material, high-added-value, and marketable products. "Seeking life from death" is a good way to optimize the structure of enterprises and products. In Changshu City alone, over 130 unprofitable factories have been merged by factories with product or financial advantages. The collective has shed the burden of making up for losses, and advantageous products have quickly expanded their production capacity. This city has also decentralized as many projects as possible to households. Mo City, Xushi, Wangshi, and Biqiu Townships have decentralized over 7,000 sewing machines, and most of the wool sweaters are produced by farmers' households.

The single-component Suzhou model is beginning to move towards the coexistence of multiple economic components.

Resolutely "reducing swelling." After the rectification work began, many keen observers first noticed this point: We must not give up the advantage of "light equipment" of township enterprises and quickly "reduce swelling"!

The best farmer entrepreneur in the country, Xiao Shui Gen, the general manager of Dasheng Shoe Factory in Wujiang County, started from himself: First, the general factory department took the lead in reducing personnel from the original 28 to 8. The three janitors in the office building were all dismissed. Cleaning and receiving guests, from the general manager to the typist, everyone did it themselves. Second, the general manager's fund was halved. Third, the car expenses of the general department were reduced by 60%. He led the way, and layer by layer took action. The four branch factories simultaneously reduced management cadres and strengthened the production front line. The entire factory reduced 53 cadres at the level of workshop director and above, and this alone can save 150,000 yuan in expenses this year...

Striving to "break out." In the face of a deteriorating environment, people found that enterprises producing export products generally have a better time, and "three-in-one" enterprises are even more obvious. In Xizhang Town, Zhangjiagang City, there are 20 latex glove production lines. However, when most places are in a dilemma, they are not worried about funds, raw materials, and sales channels. Their products are continuously exported, and profits are rolling in. Last year, the export volume reached 40 million yuan, and the profit rate was over 10%. What is the reason? In addition to their possession of production equipment and technical foundations for medical gloves, the most important thing is that their production lines are all joint ventures with foreign investors or joint operations with foreign trade. That is, "both ends are outside" is real.

Finding opportunities to "break out" and creating conditions to "break out" have become the important development strategies of many townships. Suzhou City, which had only 11 "three-in-one" enterprises at the beginning of last year, had increased to 63 by the end of the year.

Suzhou, facing the sea and the river, has the natural conditions to "break out," but how much can be "broken out" does not entirely depend on the subjective wishes of farmer entrepreneurs. How the relevant departments cooperate and how the foreign trade departments deepen reforms to adapt to this situation are urgent issues.

Old Strategies Revisited

For the difficulty of insufficient funds, Suzhou's basic strategies are three: to strive for more from above, to cooperate more horizontally, and to dig deep internally. But most comrades know that it would be good if the bank loan quota does not continue to be suppressed, and there is little room for relaxation. Horizontal borrowing is also not as easy as in previous years because the overall situation is tight, and no one is relaxed. More than one comrade told me: Although it is called, the main work is still done below.

For the other two major difficulties: tight raw materials and energy, what are their responses?

The answers from each county (city), township (town), and village are almost the same: only continue to carry forward the tradition of "four thousand and four million" (thousands of ways, thousands of mountains, thousands of hardships, thousands of words), and there is no other way.

A very shrewd entrepreneur frankly said: We rely on the contradiction between the planned and non-planned economy to buy some high-priced raw materials. If everything is "unified," township enterprises will have a hard time surviving. There is no way, we still have to continue to "find loopholes."

Since there is no food for them in the big pot of the national plan, they have to rely on their flexible mechanism and flexible operating methods, most of which are based on cooperation and joint ventures, and do not violate national policies. However, the situation has changed drastically, and many materials have deepened macro-control. Some are monopolized, and some are restricted from operating, cutting off many supply channels for township enterprises. The designated channels are not smooth, objectively exacerbating the supply and demand contradiction.

For example, coal. In the second half of last year, only the fuel company was allowed to operate. The coal source is not only tighter, but the price is also rising uncontrollably. The shortage of coal also affects electricity. Many township leaders anxiously told the reporter: Stopping electricity for one day reduces tens of thousands of yuan in pure profit! However, recently, power outages have become a common occurrence. For example, steel. The higher authorities stipulate that only the supply and marketing cooperatives can operate, but Suzhou's supply and marketing cooperatives have hardly ever engaged in this business. From personnel to business relationships, everything has to start from scratch, while the needs of production cannot be interrupted for a day.

It seems that how to handle the control of soaring prices and continue to activate the economy is still a far-from-solved issue.

### “压”出来的对策——整治中看苏南的乡镇工业（下）

　　“压”出来的对策
    ——整治中看苏南的乡镇工业（下）
    本报记者  吴长生
    苏南的乡镇工业经受着严峻的考验，也面临着提高的机遇。
    铺摊“热”降温
    １９８６年春，也是银行紧抽银根、压缩基建规模时，可苏南给我印象最深的却是另一句流传颇广的悄悄话：“压得了别处，压不住我们，他们下，我们正好上。”正是在这种思想指导下，苏南乡镇企业固定资产投入增加的步伐一点也没放慢。如今，人们尝到了苦味，承认的确有铺摊子“过热”的问题。
    苏州、无锡两市，近４年，都分别以平均每年１０亿元的投资铺新摊子、搞技术改造，而他们每年的利润不过５亿来元，就是加上原资产折旧资金，也到不了１０亿。过猛的固定资产投入，一方面加重了企业的贷、借款利息负担，一方面使原本已很紧张的流动资金越发不足。
    这次紧缩，企业不叫苦的极少。一些起步晚的乡村更是雪上加霜。例如宜兴市新建乡，去年一下子上了１０个新项目，总投资４０００多万元。现在债台高筑，贷、借款共达６３００万元，而自有流动资金只有４００万元，６个竣工的企业无法正常生产，４个尚未完工的无力收尾。
    现实使人们清醒了。记者不止一次听到这样的说法：这次可不能再侥幸钻空子，得扎扎实实练“内功”了。
    失误的警示
    苏南已有了２０多年兴办乡镇企业的经验，在项目选择上的大失误是极少的。但去年的乳胶手套“热”，给了人们一次新的警示。
    由于防治艾滋病的需要，从前年下半年起，国际市场上出现了乳胶手套需求“热”。一些外商和国内经营部门，拿着订单到处求购，并声称不管什么等级，连等外品也包销。几个生产类似产品的企业当即转产，很快赚了大钱。于是，“大上”之风骤然而起。张家港一市上了８０条生产线，昆山县一个镇竟上了２２条。
    面对这股“热浪”，苏州市乡镇企业局赶紧摸国际市场行情，并于去年３月就发出了警报。但一些地方正在兴头，岂肯紧急刹车。短短一年多时间，苏州市各乡镇竟冒出了１８０条乳胶手套生产线。仅仅几个月，行情果真大变，一些生产线还没安装完，买方市场便变成了卖方市场。主要消费国美国一面在出产原料的东南亚投资办厂，一面提高了产品进口标准。当初拍胸脯包销一切产品的商人们没了去向，大量手套压在仓库、压在口岸销不出去。
    据介绍，目前这１８０条生产线，只有１／３左右赚回了投资，而其余大部只能开开停停，还有些干脆无法运转。
    一位农民企业家说：这次失误，吃亏在没好好研究国际市场。搞外向型经济，光靠我们前几年那点应付国内市场变化的经验是远远不够的。
    “压”出来的对策
    试行股份制。为了解决流动资金困难，也为了动员全体职工协力渡难关，苏州市从去年末开始，在乡镇企业全面推行带有集资性质的增量股份制（仅新吸收资金投股付息、分红），并广泛开展较完善的存量股份制（原有资产也折成股份，与新增股份一样参与分红）试点工作。
    兼并与下放并举。苏南也有一部分亏损或微利企业。但因“手心手背都是肉”，谁也下不了狠心关并它们。如今，危机逼迫人们作出选择，引导各乡、村开展兼并、拍卖和下放，推动企业向效益好的靠拢，产品向低能耗、低物耗、附加值高的适销产品靠拢。“死中求活”，正好优化企业结构和产品结构。仅常熟市，就有１３０多个不景气的厂子被具有产品或财力优势的厂家兼并。集体卸掉了补亏包袱，优势产品迅速扩大了生产能力。这个市还把能由家庭搞的项目尽量下放到家庭。莫城、徐市、王市、碧溪等乡镇已下放横机７０００多台，羊毛衫基本都由农民家庭生产。
    单一成份的苏南模式，开始向多经济成份并存迈进。
    锐意“消肿”。整治工作开始后，许多明眼人先看到这一点：不能丢掉乡镇企业“轻装”的优势，得赶快“消肿”！
    全国最佳农民企业家、吴江县达胜皮鞋总厂厂长肖水根，先从自己“消”起：一、总厂厂部率先精简人员，由原来的２８人减为８人。办公楼原来的３名勤杂工，一个不留。清扫、待客，从厂长到打字员，全自己干。二、厂长基金砍掉一半。三、厂部小车费用压缩６０％。他一带头，层层行动。４个分厂一起压缩管理干部，充实生产一线。全厂共裁减车间主任以上干部５３人，仅此，今年就可节约１５万元开支……
    奋力“往外冲”。在环境恶化的情况下，人们发现，生产出口产品的企业日子普遍比较好过，而“三资”企业更为明显。张家港市西张乡双龙村，有２０条乳胶手套生产线，可在多数地方一筹莫展的时候，他们却资金、原料、销路“三不愁”，产品源源出口，利润滚滚而来，去年出口额达４０００万元，利润率在１０％以上。什么原因？除去他们具有生产医用手套的设备、技术基础而外，更重要的是他们的生产线都是与外商合资或与外贸联营的。也就是“两头在外”是实的。
    寻找“往外冲”的机会，创造“向外冲”的条件，成为众多乡镇的重要发展战略。苏州市，去年初“三资”企业仅１１家，年底已增至６３家。
    苏南，临海、靠江，“往外冲”的条件得天独厚，但能“冲”出去多少，并不完全取决于农民企业家们的主观愿望。各有关部门如何配合，应当研究。外贸部门如何深化改革，以适应这种形势，也迫在眉睫。
    老对策重提
    对资金紧缺困难，苏南基本是三条对策：向上多争取、横向多联合、向内狠挖掘。但绝大多数同志心中有数，银行贷款指标不继续压就不错，松动的余地极小，而横向拆借也不像前几年那么容易，因为全局收紧，哪儿也不松。不止一位同志向我说：叫归叫，可主要的文章还是做在下边。
    对另外两大难题：原材料、能源紧张，他们又作出怎样的反应呢？
    各县（市）、乡（镇）、村的回答几乎是一致的，只有继续发扬“四千四万”的传统（千方百计、千山万水、千辛万苦、千言万语），别无良策。
    一位颇精明的企业家直率地说：我们就是靠计划内外的矛盾，才能买到点高价的原材料。全“统”起来，乡镇企业就很难活命了。没办法，我们还得继续“钻空子”。
    既然国家计划的大锅里没有它的饭。他们就得靠自己的灵活机制、灵活经营手段，其中绝大多数是建立在合作、联营基础上的，并不违犯国家政策。可是如今，形势骤变，多种物资加深了宏观调控，有的专营、有的限制经营，切断了许多乡镇企业原来的供应渠道，而指定的渠道又不通畅，客观上加剧了供需矛盾。
    例如，煤炭，去年下半年只允许燃料公司一家经营。煤源不仅更紧，而且价格暴涨不止。煤缺，也影响到电。许多乡镇领导焦急地对记者说：停一天电就减少几万元纯利啊！可是近来拉闸停电却成了家常便饭。再如钢材，上头指定只许供销社代营，可苏南的供销社几乎从来没搞过这项业务。从人员到业务关系全得从头来，而生产的需要却是一天也不能断。
    看来，如何处理控制物价暴涨与继续搞活经济的关系，还是一个远未解决的课题。
