	Capital business and theoretical circles propose that business culture studies are worth researching and should explore socialist commodity economy from new perspectives.

	People's Daily, Beijing, April 2 — Reporters Dai Yuqing and Pan Gang report: When "Transformers" flooded the domestic toy market, most parents only saw it as an impact wave of imported goods. However, "Transformers" injected a new way of thinking into children's minds — geometric shapes can be combined into various images, giants can suddenly turn into cars, and then instantly into airplanes. "This shows that commodities are carriers of culture. Commodity exchange is a cultural exchange."

	Yesterday, at an academic discussion meeting, Minister of Commerce Hu Ping proposed that experts and business workers seriously study "business culture studies."

	This "business culture studies" discussion meeting, organized by the China Business Daily, attracted many people. Hu Ping expressed his regret about some shortcomings in the capital's business sector. He said, "Marx compared the peasant economy to a bag of unrelated potatoes. Many shops, savings banks, subway stations, and toilets in Beijing are almost all separate. In fact, they can be more convenient for customers if connected. For example, the entrance of a subway station is a good place to set up a shop, and public toilets should be built near shopping malls." This phenomenon shows that the commodity economy in the primary stage of socialism is not developed, and business culture also bears traces of backwardness. He believes that the study of business culture should aim to promote reform and develop the commodity economy.

	Philosopher Li Zehou's views on "business culture" are both humorous and profound. He said, "The emotions of 30 million business workers affect our emotions. Service quality reflects the level of business culture." He believes that in the process of modernization, business culture must take off. Doing commodity economy means making money, but we should also maintain human touch. We need to talk about profits and also about ethics. This is a very worthy theoretical topic to study, a test of China's modernization.

	General Manager Liu Zhenchang of Beijing Longfu Mall and a group of entrepreneurs also believe that traditional Chinese business ethics, such as "no cheating the young and the elderly" and "if the deal is not done, friendship remains," are worth inheriting and promoting as business culture.

	At the meeting, experts also discussed the definition, scope, and objects of "business culture studies" from multiple angles such as cultural studies, folklore, and psychology.

### 首都商业界理论界人士提出  商业文化学值得研究  应从新视角探索社会主义商品经济

　　首都商业界理论界人士提出
    商业文化学值得研究
    应从新视角探索社会主义商品经济
    本报北京４月２日讯  记者戴玉庆、潘岗报道：当“变形金刚”涌入国内玩具市场时，家长们大多只把它看作是一种进口商品的冲击波，而“变形金刚”却在孩子们的头脑中注入了一种新的思维方式——几何图形可以组合成各种形象，巨人倏而变作汽车，转瞬又成了飞机……“这表明，商品是一种文化的载体。商品交换是一种文化的交换。”
    昨天，商业部部长胡平在一次学术讨论会上，倡议专家学者和商业工作者认真研究“商业文化学”。
    这次由中国商报举办的“商业文化学”讨论会吸引了许多人。胡平表示了他对首都商业的某些缺憾之感。他说，马克思把小农经济比作一口袋互不关联的马铃薯。北京的许多商店、储蓄所、地铁站、厕所几乎都各自分离。其实它们联系起来更能方便顾客。例如，地铁站口是办商店的好地方，商场附近则最应修建公厕。这种现象说明，社会主义初级阶段商品经济不发达，商业文化也就带有落后的痕迹。他认为，研究商业文化应该以促进改革，发展商品经济为宗旨。
    哲学家李泽厚对于“商业文化”的看法既富有幽默感，又颇为深刻。他说：“３０００万商业职工的情绪影响着我们的情绪。服务质量反映了商业文化的水准。”他认为，在现代化的进程中，商业文化必然要起步。搞商品经济就要赚钱，但我们又应保持人情味。又要言利，又要言义，这是一个很值得研究的理论课题，是对中国走向现代化的考验。
    北京隆福大厦总经理刘振昌等一批企业家也认为，中国传统的商业道德，如“童叟无欺”、“买卖不成仁义在”等等，都是值得继承和发扬的商业文化。
    会上，专家们还从文化学、民俗学、心理学等多视角，“商业文化学”的定义、研究范围、研究对象展开了讨论。
