Premier Li Peng of the State Council said that China's determination to achieve the Four Modernizations and to carry out reform and opening up is unwavering; the current rectification and readjustment we are undertaking is aimed at better developing the economy and ensuring the smooth progress of reform and opening up.

Premier Li Peng made these remarks this afternoon at the Great Hall of the People while meeting with a Japanese food development delegation led by the chairman of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations, Eishirou Saito.

He said that China is a developing country with a large population and relatively scarce commodities. If the state does not exercise macro-control, it will inevitably lead to chaos.

Li Peng also said that in the future economic development, agriculture is both the most important and the most difficult area. Developing agriculture requires the government and the people to make great efforts.

He said that Japan has good experience in developing agriculture and the food industry, and the two sides can strengthen exchanges and cooperation. We welcome the Japan International Cooperation Agency, established to promote investment, to play an active role in strengthening agricultural cooperation between China and Japan.

Vice Premier Tian Jiyun also met with the delegation led by Eishirou Saito today.

　　李鹏会见日本客人
    据新华社北京３月３１日电  （记者朱云龙）国务院总理李鹏说，中国实现四化目标和进行改革开放的决心是坚定不移的；我们当前进行的治理整顿就是为了更好地发展经济，保证改革开放的顺利进行。
    李鹏总理是今天下午在人民大会堂会见由日本经济团体联合会会长斋藤英四郎率领的日本食品开发访华团时说这番话的。
    他说，中国是一个人口众多的发展中国家，商品相对短缺，如果国家不进行宏观控制，就势必造成混乱。
    李鹏还说，在未来的经济发展中，农业是一个最重要也是最困难的领域。发展农业要求政府和人民付出巨大的努力。
    他说，日本在发展农业和食品工业方面有很好的经验，中日双方可以加强交流和合作。我们欢迎为了促进投资而成立的日本国际协力机构在加强中日农业合作方面发挥积极作用。
    国务院副总理田纪云今天也会见了斋藤英四郎一行。
