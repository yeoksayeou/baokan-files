The Rev. Wen Yi-Huan, an advisor to the "National Alliance for Democracy and Unification" in South Korea, became the first opposition leader in 40 years to visit Pyongyang without official permission from March 25 to April 3. Upon his return to Gimpo Airport in Seoul on April 13, he was arrested by the security authorities for allegedly violating the National Security Law and was taken to the "Agency for National Security Planning" for investigation. On the same day, over 1,500 members from more than 40 opposition groups in South Korea held a rally to condemn the authorities for arresting Rev. Wen Yi-Huan.

Why did Rev. Wen Yi-Huan's visit to Pyongyang cause such a stir in Seoul's political landscape?

At 71 years old, Rev. Wen Yi-Huan has been a prominent figure in South Korea's democratization movement since he began participating in opposition activities in 1976. His long experience as a pastor and a professor of theology has instilled in him a steadfast spirit to practice his beliefs. His frankness and integrity have also earned him respect in society. His frequent speeches advocating for his views on reunification and calling for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea have garnered him public support but have also irritated the authorities. In March 1976, he was first arrested and imprisoned for drafting the "March 1st Declaration for National Salvation" opposing Park Chung-hee's Yushin Constitution. Over the next 13 years, he was arrested four times, spending a total of seven years in prison. This experience only strengthened his resolve to pursue democracy and shaped his unique vision of reunification: unification is democracy, and democracy is unification. He advocates for a three-stage process to achieve a federal reunification. He points out that the current division has become a breeding ground for anti-democratic, anti-national, and anti-people forces.

According to people close to Rev. Wen Yi-Huan, his visit to Pyongyang was a manifestation of his beliefs in action. During his visit, he met with Chairman Kim Il-sung twice to discuss reunification issues and signed a joint statement with Chairman Kim Il-sung and the Chairman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, Ri Jong-ok, outlining nine principles for self-reliant and peaceful reunification. At press conferences in Pyongyang, Beijing, and Tokyo, he repeatedly stated, "The gains were greater than expected," and expressed his hope for "possible high-level talks between the South and the North."

Rev. Wen Yi-Huan's visit to Pyongyang sparked diverse and even diametrically opposed reactions in Seoul. The Minister of Justice, Heo Hyeong-gu, stated, "Wen clearly violated Article 6, Section 1, and Article 8, Section 1 of the National Security Law." The ruling New Democratic Republican Party considered Wen's visit to Pyongyang a criminal act and demanded his arrest and investigation, fearing the emergence of a "second or third Wen Yi-Huan incident." The People's Party "regretted that Wen did not consult with the government before his visit to the North." The Democratic Party took a two-pronged approach, severely criticizing Wen's visit to the North while also "opposing the government's dual standards in enforcement" and exposing the "Roh Tae-woo administration's attempt to use the incident to strengthen the suppression of legitimate progressive forces." The Republican Party believed that while the government should handle the matter according to the law, "the government's lack of coherence in its policy towards the North also needs to be reviewed." The "National Alliance for Democracy and Unification" and other opposition groups issued statements condemning the authorities for suppressing Rev. Wen Yi-Huan. Before returning to Seoul, Wen heard the news and repeatedly stated, "I have been imprisoned many times and am not afraid of being imprisoned, but this time I do not want to be imprisoned because I have many things to do." However, the opposite of his wishes occurred.

The storm triggered by Wen Yi-Huan's visit to Pyongyang will not only affect South Korea's future direction but also impact the relationship between North and South Korea. According to reports, the South Korean authorities will implement a "single window policy" for exchanges with the North and will proceed more cautiously with their approach to the North. The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland in North Korea issued a statement strongly condemning the South Korean authorities for arresting Rev. Wen Yi-Huan and demanding that the South Korean authorities take full responsibility for all consequences arising from this incident. The situation is currently developing.

　　文益焕风波

    南朝鲜“全国民族民主运动联合会”顾问文益焕牧师，作为４０年来第一位在野团体领导人，于３月２５日至４月３日在未经当局允许的情况下访问了平壤。４月１３日回到汉城的金浦机场时，即被治安当局以触犯《国家保安法》为由逮捕，并押送到“安全企划部”，开始对他进行“调查”。同一天，南朝鲜４０多个在野团体的１５００多人举行集会，谴责当局逮捕文益焕牧师。
    文益焕牧师访问平壤何以会在汉城政局中掀起一场风波？
    今年７１岁的文益焕牧师自从１９７６年开始投入在野民主化运动以来，一直是南朝鲜民主化运动的著名人物之一。教会牧师和神学院教授的长期经历使他养成了为实践自己信念而坚韧不拔的精神，而为人坦率等品格也同样使他饮誉社会。由于他经常在讲话中提出自己关于统一问题的见解，并且要求撤走驻南朝鲜美军，从而受到群众的支持，但同时也刺痛了当局的神经。１９７６年３月１日他因反对朴正熙维新体制起草“三一救国宣言”第一次被捕入狱以来，１３年中先后四次被捕，总计度过长达７年的铁窗生活。这一经历反倒磨砺了他矢志追求民主的意志，并且形成了自己独特的统一观：统一即民主，民主即统一。他主张分三阶段实现联邦制统一。他指出，分裂的现实成了反民主、反民族、反民众势力的温床。
    据文益焕牧师身边的人员说，他这次访问平壤，可以说就是他把自己的信念付诸行动。访问期间，他两次会见金日成主席，商谈统一问题，并同祖国和平统一委员会委员长许锬共同就自主和平统一的原则问题签署了包括９项条款的《联合声明》。他在平壤、北京、东京举行的记者招待会上，几乎都说：“收获比预期的还要大”，并表示期待“可能实现南北高峰会谈”。
    围绕文益焕牧师的平壤之行，在汉城引起各不相同甚至截然相反的巨大反应。“法务部长官”许亨九说：“文氏分明违反国家保安法第６条第１款、第８条第１款”，“政府的方针是详细调查其动机、目的、经过及在北韩的活动，依法严处”。执政的民正党认为文益焕访问平壤是犯法行为，应该拘捕调查，并且担心由此出现“第二乃至第三个文牧师事件”。平民党“对文牧师北访前未同政府协商感到遗憾”。民主党则左右开弓，一方面严厉批评文牧师的北访行动，另方面也“反对（政府）在执法上的二元化”，并揭露“卢泰愚政权企图利用入北事件以加强镇压合理的进步势力”。共和党则认为在依法论处的同时，“政府诱发此类行动的缺乏连贯性的对北政策本身也需再作检查”。“全国民族民主运动联合会”等在野团体，则发表声明谴责当局对文益焕牧师采取镇压手段。文益焕牧师在回汉城前听到这个消息时曾一再表示：“我多次坐牢，也不怕坐牢，但这次不想坐牢，因为我有许多事情要做。”但是，同他意愿相反的事终于发生了。
    由文益焕访问平壤掀起的风波，不仅将影响到南朝鲜今后的走向，也将会影响朝鲜北南双方的关系。据报道，南朝鲜当局今后将实行“对北交流窗口单一化”，“将更谨慎地推进对北接近的政策”。而朝鲜祖国和平统一委员会发表的声明则严厉谴责南朝鲜当局逮捕文益焕牧师，要求南朝鲜当局对由此造成的一切后果承担全部责任。事态目前在发展中。
