During my 10-day visit to Mongolia, I stayed in four different hotels, ranging from a top-tier hotel in the capital to hotels in provinces and counties, as well as a guesthouse in a resort area. Whether it was the room service staff or the restaurant servers, none of them accepted tips. In other public places like theater coat check rooms, the staff provided enthusiastic service without expecting tips. My companion, Adiya, is a professional diplomat who has visited several countries and is well aware of the relationship between tips and service quality abroad. However, he said that providing good service is the duty of service staff, for which they already receive a salary, and there is no reason not to serve attentively. This is how Mongolians understand their work, so they do not have the habit of giving tips.

In Ulaanbaatar, I attended three performances: a ballet, a folk song and dance show, and a circus. These were three performances with different artistic forms and audiences. The ballet audience had a higher level of artistic appreciation, while the folk song and dance show was enjoyed by both the elite and the common people. The circus audience was mostly young people. The three performances left me with an impression of the audience's civilized behavior: before entering the theater, they voluntarily left their coats, jackets, and hats in the coat check room; after entering, they maintained a clean and quiet environment inside, with no smoking, eating snacks, or drinking beverages, no loud talking, and certainly no whistling, stomping, or booing; during the performance, the audience was fully focused on the stage, with very few people moving around, and at the end of a piece, the audience expressed their appreciation or requested an encore with sustained, rhythmic applause. The performers also conducted themselves with dignity, without any frivolous or provocative actions. The behavior on stage and in the audience reflected the Mongolian society's emphasis on civilized conduct.

In Ulaanbaatar, I did not have the opportunity to ride public buses or trolleybuses. However, from the window of my hotel, I often observed the operation of cars and trolleybuses on the square in front of the building. What caught my eye was the orderly movement of the vehicles, the clean bodies of the cars, and the bright windows. Although there were more people waiting at the stops during rush hours, they did not form lines, but when the vehicle arrived, they would get off first and then board in an orderly manner, without pushing or shoving. Everyone voluntarily followed the rules and maintained public morality.

　　讲文明　守秩序
　  ——访问蒙古散记
　　丹林
    在蒙古１０天访问中，我相继住过４个旅馆，从首都的一流旅馆到省、县的旅馆、疗养区的宾馆。无论是客房服务员或餐厅服务员，都不收小费。其它公共场所如剧场衣帽间，服务员热情服务也不收小费。我的陪同阿地亚是位职业外交官，到过一些国家，深知在国外小费与服务殷勤的关系。但他说，搞好服务是服务员的本份职责，为此已经领取了工资，没有理由不认真服务。蒙古人就是这样理解自己工作的，所以没有使用小费的习惯。
    在乌兰巴托，我看过３次文艺演出：芭蕾舞、民族歌舞和马戏。这是３场艺术形式与观众群均不相同的演出。芭蕾舞的观众有较高的艺术修养，民族歌舞则雅俗共赏，而观马戏的数青少年最多。３场演出给我留下的印象是观众的文明举止：进入剧场前，自觉地把大衣、外套、帽子留存在衣帽间；入场后保持场内整洁与宁静，没有抽烟、吃零食、喝饮料的，没有高声说笑的，更没有吹口哨、跺脚、怪吹的；演出时，观众全神贯注于舞台，场内很少有人走动，一曲终了，观众以持续的有节奏的掌声表示谢意或请求加演。演员也端庄自重，绝无轻浮挑逗的动作。舞台上下的表现反映出蒙古人讲究文明的社会风气。
    在乌兰巴托，我没有机会乘坐公共汽车或无轨电车。但在旅馆的窗前，我多次地观察过楼前广场上的汽车和电车的运行。印入眼帘的总是款款而行的车辆，整洁的车身，明亮的车窗，站台上候车的人们（上下班时还是比较多的）虽未见排列成队，但车来时总是先下后上，鱼贯而行，没见过拥挤，没见过推搡，人人自觉地遵守秩序，讲究公共道德。
