On the morning of April 20, five villagers from Beifeng Village in Anfeng Township, Anyang County, Henan Province, including Zhang Shuiqu, were digging for sand on the banks of the Zhang River, which borders Henan and Hebei provinces. To their surprise, they discovered a wooden cylinder about one meter long. Upon opening it, they found 19 silver ingots covered in black rust, each weighing approximately 1850 grams. The total value of the ingots was over 20,000 yuan. The ingots were inscribed with "Qianjiang County," "Xiangyang County," and "the fifth month of the fifth year of the Guangxu reign," among other characters. Experts from the bank confirmed that these were indeed silver ingots. The villagers then traveled to the Anyang Public Security Bureau to present the recovered treasure to the state.
