Xinhua News Agency, Islamabad, April 24th.

In recent years, the global "social cancer" of drug abuse and trafficking has spread rapidly in Pakistan. From cultivating poppies to refining drugs, from domestic sales to international smuggling, all have become organized activities. The tragedies, social unrest, and criminal activities triggered by drugs are countless. For this reason, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has called out to the nation: "We must strike this devil before it strikes us."

The harm to youth is shocking. In Lahore, a 21-year-old university student, after trying a friend's "miracle drug," became addicted, dropped out of school, and joined a drug ring, turning a handsome young man into a skeletal figure; a 19-year-old high school student stole from neighbors to buy drugs, eventually turning to pickpocketing foreign tourists, and has been arrested three times; a 17-year-old scion of a wealthy family became an addict, and his father forcibly sent him to a detoxification clinic, ruining his studies and future.

People say that the incidents and figures revealed in the newspapers are only "the tip of the iceberg." The newly appointed anti-drug minister admits that there are about 1.9 million drug users nationwide, with the youth drug problem being particularly severe. The direct reason is their weak resistance, lack of knowledge about the harm of drugs, and easy susceptibility to traps. Drug traffickers use every trick to lure them in and then exploit them.

Where do the drugs come from? The border regions of Pakistan's Northwest Frontier Province and Afghanistan have a tradition of poppy cultivation. In the late 1970s, drug abuse became prevalent in Western countries, and the international drug market demand increased, stimulating drug production here. Especially after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the southern part of Afghanistan became a "no-man's-land," where refugees gathered with no means of livelihood. Many became laborers for poppy cultivation and drug refining, making this region's drug production exceed that of Southeast Asia's "Golden Triangle," becoming the main source of the international drug market.

Articles have revealed that huge profits have turned some people into reckless poppy cultivators and drug traffickers. In the eyes of drug smugglers, drugs are money. Many drug trafficking organizations possess modern weapons and communication equipment, hiring various people to serve them at exorbitant prices. Drug gangs often fight over business or territory.

The government's resolve. After the People's Party came to power, it made drug eradication and prohibition a "major policy goal," upgrading the original Drug Control Bureau to a ministerial-level agency. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has repeatedly emphasized the need to eliminate drugs, the "great enemy of Muslims." In late March, Pakistan, taking the opportunity of the international anti-drug conference held in Karachi, launched a nationwide anti-drug propaganda campaign.

The newly appointed anti-drug minister recently announced that the legislative body will issue orders to severely punish the "big fish" in drug trafficking, strengthen anti-drug operations, and severely punish drug traffickers who harm youth. Additionally, the government will, with the assistance of the United Nations, allocate large funds to improve soil conditions in border areas, provide various preferential conditions to farmers, and encourage them to abandon poppies and cultivate grains and other economic crops. Because only by eliminating the "source of poison" can anti-drug work truly be effective.

Anti-drug and prohibition are not the responsibility of a single country; international cooperation is crucial. The fourth South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) summit has designated 1989 as the "South Asian Anti-Drug Year." With the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and the improvement of relations among South Asian countries, there is reason to believe that South Asian countries will achieve success in anti-drug efforts.

### 巴基斯坦的反毒运动  “在被魔鬼击倒前把它击倒”

　　巴基斯坦的反毒运动     
    “在被魔鬼击倒前把它击倒”
    本报记者  任毓骏
    近年来，举世为之头痛的“社会癌症”——吸毒和贩毒在巴基斯坦蔓延。从种植罂粟到提炼毒品，从国内销售到走私海外，都已形成有组织的活动。因毒品诱发的家庭悲剧，社会动乱和犯罪活动数不胜数。为此，贝·布托总理向全国疾呼：“我们一定要在被这个魔鬼击倒前把它击倒”。
    青少年受害怵目惊心。拉合尔一名年仅２１岁的大学生，尝了朋友给的“灵丹妙药”后不能自拔，辍学加入了吸毒团伙，一个英俊的小伙子变得骨瘦如柴；一名１９岁的中学生偷盗邻居的钱财换取毒品，后发展到在外国游客中行窃，已被三次拘捕；一位上等人家的１７岁的公子，成了瘾君子，他父亲强行把他送进了戒毒诊所，他的学业和前程无疑都耽误了。
    人们说，报纸上披露的事件和数字只不过是“冰山浮出水面的一角”。新上任的反毒品国务部长承认，全国约有１９０万吸毒者，而青少年的吸毒问题尤为严重，其直接的原因是他们的抵制能力差，不知道毒品为害之深，容易上钩，毒品贩子施尽一切伎俩拖他们下水，然后再榨油。
    源源毒品从何而来。巴基斯坦西北边境省和阿富汗接壤一带地区，有种植罂粟的传统。７０年代末，西方国家吸毒成风，国际毒品市场需求量日大，刺激了这里的毒品生产。特别是苏联入侵阿富汗以后，阿富汗南部成了“三不管”地带，云集在那里的难民无以为生，许多人成为种植罂粟、提炼毒品的劳动力，使得这一地区的毒品产量超过了东南亚的“金三角”，成为国际毒品市场的主要货源。
    有文章披露，巨额的利润使一些人成为种植罂粟和贩毒的亡命之徒。在毒品走私犯的眼中，毒品就是金钱。许多贩毒组织拥有现代化的武器、通讯设备，出巨资雇佣各种人为其服务。贩毒团伙之间经常为生意或地盘而发生械斗。
    政府的决心。人民党执政后，把扫毒、禁毒当作“重大的政策目标”，把原来的毒品控制局升格为部级机构，贝·布托总理多次强调，一定要清除毒品这一“穆斯林的大敌”。３月下旬，巴基斯坦借国际反毒品会议在卡拉奇召开之机，掀起一场全国性的反毒品宣传运动。
    新任命的反毒品国务部长日前宣布，立法机构将颁布法令，严惩贩毒的“大鱼”，加强缉毒工作，对毒害青少年的毒品贩子将严惩不贷。另外，政府将在联合国的协助下，拨巨款在边境地带改良土壤，向农民提供种种优惠条件，鼓励他们摒弃罂粟，改种粮食和其他经济作物。因为只有消除了“毒源”，反毒工作才能真正奏效。
    反毒、禁毒不是一个国家的事情，国际间的配合至关重要。第四届南亚区域合作会议已把１９８９年定为“南亚禁毒年”。随着苏联从阿富汗撤军以及南亚各国关系的改善，人们有理由相信，南亚各国将在反毒方面取得成就。
