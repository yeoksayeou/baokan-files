    Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Gansu, and Jiangxi provinces and municipalities have emphasized technological progress and improving the quality of the workforce to develop the economy and increase efficiency during the rectification period. They have requested that the State Education Commission allocate more university graduates to them this year and have taken measures to actively accept these graduates.

    Tianjin's industrial system currently has 56,000 engineering and technical personnel, accounting for only 5.6% of the total workforce. The municipal government has decided to increase the proportion of technical personnel in the workforce and has requested that the State Education Commission, in addition to the 1,378 university graduates already planned for this year, allocate an additional 2,622 graduates. Together with 6,000 graduates from local institutions, the city will accept a total of 10,000 graduates this year, the highest number in history. Hebei Province, based on talent forecasts, predicts a need for 425,000 specialized personnel with associate degrees or higher by the year 2000 (excluding those needed in the education system). However, the province is expected to produce only 300,000 graduates and postgraduates during this period, leaving a shortage of 125,000. The provincial government has urged all departments to have a strategic vision and to plan annually to accept university graduates, aiming to achieve the strategic goal of "Revitalizing Hebei through Science and Technology."

    The Gansu Provincial Government has decided to seize the opportunity presented by the control of graduate admissions in some inland provinces and municipalities to accept more university graduates, particularly not allowing graduates sent by institutions from other provinces to be returned. The province welcomes all graduates who wish to work in Gansu and will not turn them away. The Shandong Provincial Government, based on actual needs, has proposed a requirement for 70,000 graduates. However, provincial and central institutions can only provide 30,000 this year. The provincial government has requested that the State Education Commission allocate as many graduates as possible.

　　津冀鲁甘赣注重科技进步  采取措施接收高校毕业生
    本报讯  记者毕全忠报道：国家教委学生司近日向记者透露：天津、河北、山东、甘肃、江西等省、市在治理整顿中注意依靠科技进步和提高劳动者素质来发展经济、提高效益，并要求国家教委今年多给它们分配高校毕业生，采取措施积极接收高校毕业生。
    天津市工业系统现有工程技术人员５．６万名，仅占职工总数的５．６％，市政府决定提高科技人员在职工中的比例，要求国家教委在今年计划分配给它的１３７８名高校毕业生之外再增派２６２２名，加上本市院校毕业生６０００名，全市今年共接收１００００名，是接收大学生最多的一年。河北省根据人才预测，到２０００年需补充专科以上专门人才４２．５万名（不包括教育系统所需人才），而预计本省这期间培养的本、专科毕业生和研究生仅３０万名，尚缺１２．５万名。省政府要求各部门有战略眼光，每年都要有计划地接收高校毕业生，以实现“科技兴冀”的战略方针。甘肃省政府决定抓住内地一些省、市控制接收毕业生的良机多接收高校毕业生，尤其不许把外省院校派来的毕业生退回去；凡愿来甘肃工作的毕业生都要欢迎，不能拒之门外。山东省政府根据实际需求，提出需要７００００名毕业生，但省属院校和中央各部所属院校今年能提供的仅３００００名。省政府要求国家教委尽量多分派一些。
