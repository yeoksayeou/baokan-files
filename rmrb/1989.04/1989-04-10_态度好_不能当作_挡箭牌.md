"Good Attitude" Should Not Be Used as a Shield

	Shi Zhanqi

	Often in the newspapers, one can see responses to readers' exposures of malpractices: regarding a certain comrade's abuse of power for personal gain, it is basically true, but since the person has made a deep self-examination, no further action will be taken; regarding a certain person's extravagant use of public funds, we have ordered them to make a deep self-examination, and further action will be decided based on their attitude. A certain deputy bureau-level cadre committed dereliction of duty, causing the state a loss of over 200 million yuan, but the relevant department, considering his "relatively good attitude," decided to drop the charges, demoting him from deputy bureau level to deputy section level.

	Originally, the facts and errors were clear, the problem was serious, but still no action was taken, and it all depended on the "attitude"; originally there was a crime, but because of the few words "relatively good attitude," it could be turned into no crime, and one could still hold office. In this case, the "attitude" issue seems to have become the main basis for handling the responsible parties, while serious errors and criminal facts have become trivial matters.

	Indeed, a deep self-examination and a good attitude towards admitting mistakes or guilt are commendable and should be considered in handling the case. However, no matter how good the attitude or how deep the self-examination, it cannot offset the errors or crimes.

	Moreover, some people engage in malpractices and abuse of power, and once exposed, to obtain "lenient" treatment and to downplay the issue, they will show a very "good" attitude. When making self-examinations, they will be very "deep" and "sincere," even shedding a few tears. Only a fool would have a bad attitude or an insincere self-examination. In fact, some people's so-called "good attitude" is just an act. Their goal is to achieve the three-step process of "abuse of power—deep self-examination—no trouble." Some people can receive disciplinary actions and still maintain a "good attitude," repeatedly abusing power, making self-examinations for a while, and living comfortably for a lifetime, really taking advantage of the situation.

	In reality, what constitutes a good attitude, is it genuine or fake? What constitutes a deep self-examination, is it genuine or fake? The conclusion is whether it is recognized by the masses or just the opinion of a leader? There are many tricks involved. For example, you say his self-examination is not deep, I say his self-examination is very deep; you say his attitude is bad, I say his attitude is very good. Because of his deep self-examination, no action is taken, and because of his relatively good attitude, charges are dropped, and so on, these are just excuses to exonerate the responsible parties.

	Therefore, to eliminate the phenomenon of using a "good attitude" to escape disciplinary action or legal consequences, the key is to address whether the relevant departments have the correct attitude towards anti-corruption. If they are merely going through the motions, punishing lightly, it shows a lack of responsibility towards the party's cause and discipline, or it may be a case of officials protecting each other and colluding. What attitude should we take towards these "relevant departments" and these law enforcement and disciplinary personnel?

### “态度好”不能当作“挡箭牌”

　　“态度好”不能当作“挡箭牌”
    史占旗
    经常从报上看到一种对读者揭露的不正之风的“答复”：某某同志以权谋私基本属实，但由于本人已做了深刻检查，就不再处理了；对于某某挥霍公款的问题，我们已令其作出深刻检查，将视检查态度再作处理。有一位正局级干部犯了渎职罪，给国家造成２００多万元的损失，有关部门就是“鉴于他态度较好”，决定免于起诉，由正局级降为正处级了事。
    本来错误事实俱在，问题严重，然而仍不处理，还要看一看“态度”；本来有罪，只因“态度较好”几个字，就可以变为无罪，而且照样为官。在这里，“态度”问题似乎成了对有关责任者进行处理的主要依据，而严重错误和犯罪事实却成了无关紧要的东西。
    诚然，检查深刻，认错或认罪态度较好，是应该欢迎的，在处理上也要有所考虑。然而，态度再好，检查再深刻，也不能抵消错误或罪行。
    再说，有些人搞了不正之风和以权谋私，一旦败露，为了使自己得到“从宽”处理，大事化小，小事化了，是会表现得“态度”很好的。做起检查来，也会“深刻”得很，“诚恳”得很，甚至还会挤出几滴眼泪。只有傻瓜才会态度不好，或检查不“深刻”。事实上，有些人所谓的“态度好”不过是演戏而已。其目的是为了实现“以权谋私——深刻检查——平安无事”的三部曲。有些人每受处分都能做到“态度好”就一而再以权谋私，检查一阵子，舒服一辈子，实在占尽便宜。
    其实，什么是态度好，是真好还是假好？什么是检查深刻，是真深刻还是假深刻？其结论是群众的公认，还是领导个人的意见？这里面有不少名堂。比如，你说他检查不深刻，我说他检查深刻得很；你说他态度不好，我说他态度好得很哩。因本人检查深刻就不处理，以及因态度较好免于起诉云云，不过是对责任者进行开脱的一种遁词。
    可见，要杜绝以“态度好”逃脱处分、法办的现象，关键是要解决“有关部门”对反腐败态度是否端正。敷衍了事，罚不当罪，有的是对党的事业和法纪的不负责任的态度，有的则可能是官官相护、沆瀣一气。对这些“有关部门”，对执法、执纪的这些人员，我们应采取什么态度呢？
