    Recently, the atmosphere at the Chicago Board of Trade has been unusual. On the surface, it remains bustling, but brokers are all on edge, as if they might be dismissed at any moment. Outsiders truly have no idea what is happening here.

    According to insiders, the story goes back two and a half years. A large soybean processing company in Illinois is a regular at the exchange, but it often falls victim to fraud during transactions. In a fit of anger, the company filed a complaint with the prosecutor's office. It was a stroke of luck that in 1985, Anton Valukas took over as the prosecutor and was already planning to take on these unscrupulous elements. The company's complaint solidified his resolve to go after these "white-collar criminals." He reached an agreement with the company to train a few "brokers" for the FBI and send them into the exchange to investigate the illegal activities thoroughly.

    Thus, FBI agent Carlson and his colleagues took on the mission and arrived at the exchange. They donned bright jackets and played the part of "brokers" convincingly. To truly infiltrate the circle, they mimicked the exchange's "yuppies," moving into luxurious apartments, driving fancy Mercedes-Benzes, hosting dinners, and putting on a grand show, eventually winning the trust of others. Some people actually began to share their "secrets to making money." In this way, they gradually uncovered some "money-making schemes" during their investigation and recorded them on audio and video, gathering evidence.

    After more than two years of hard work, on the evening of January 18 this year, the FBI issued summonses to dozens of suspects at the exchange. Subsequently, over two hundred more were summoned for questioning. When the brokers finally realized that the "brokers" they had been mixing with every day were actually FBI agents, they were stunned. The atmosphere at the exchange suddenly became tense. Nervous brokers sought help from lawyers, and some even sold their assets to hire defense attorneys. Now, at the exchange, people tread carefully, speaking cautiously for fear of incriminating themselves. They eye every stranger suspiciously. One broker aptly described the situation: "It's like seeing a police car in the rearview mirror, feeling uneasy." Some jokingly bolster their courage: "Don't be afraid, at most you'll get five years in jail..."

    Currently, the FBI is still conducting investigations, and everyone is waiting to see the final outcome: whether there are only a few fraudsters or an organized fraud syndicate. It is hard to tell at this point. However, for this exchange, this incident is like an earthquake.

　　特工人员入虎穴　交易所里闹地震
    近来，美国芝加哥农产品交易所的大厅里气氛异常，表面上依旧那么热闹，但经纪人个个忐忑不安，好像马上会被发落。局外人真不知道这里发生了什么？
    据了解内情者透露，事情要从两年半前说起。伊利诺斯州的一家大豆加工公司是该所的常客，但在交易过程中常常受骗，于是一气之下向检察部门提出了控告。真是无巧不成书，一九八五年出任检察官的安东·瓦卢科斯对交易所经纪人施展的伎俩略有所知，早就打算与这伙不法分子较量一番。这家公司的告发坚定了他向这些“白领罪犯”开战的决心。他和该公司达成默契，请公司为联邦调查局培养几名“经纪人”，再把他们派入交易所，以便把不法活动调查个水落石出。
    就这样，联邦调查局的卡尔森和他的伙伴接受任务，来到了交易所。他们穿上鲜艳的外套，活灵活现地当起“经纪人”来了。为了真正打入这个圈子，他们模仿着交易所的“雅皮士”，住进了豪华的公寓，坐上了漂亮的奔驰牌汽车，请客吃饭，大讲排场，终于赢得了人们的信任。有人真的开始向他们传授赚钱的“真谛”。就这样，他们在调查中逐渐发现了一些“生财之道”，并且录音、录相，掌握了罪证。
    经两年多的辛勤工作，今年一月十八日晚，联邦调查局向交易所几十名涉嫌者发出了传票。接着，又有二百多人先后被传讯。当经纪人最终发现那几个和他们天天混在一起的“经纪人”原来是联邦调查局的人员时，简直是傻了眼。交易所里的气氛骤然紧张起来，心神不定的经纪人纷纷求助于律师，有人甚至不惜变卖家产去聘请辩护人。如今在交易所里，人们如履薄冰，说话小心多了，生怕失言，招来麻烦。都用怀疑的目光注视着每个陌生人。一位经纪人形象地说：“好象是在后视镜里发现了警察，心里忐忑不安”。有的半开玩笑地为自己壮胆：“别怕，顶多坐牢五年……”
    眼下，联邦调查局还在继续调查，人们都在关注着最后的结局：是仅仅有少数几个诈骗犯还是存在一个有组织的诈骗集团，一时很难分晓。不过对这个交易所来说，这件事犹如一场地震。
