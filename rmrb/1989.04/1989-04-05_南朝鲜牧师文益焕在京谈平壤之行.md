	South Korean Pastor Mun Ik-hwan, on his way back to Seoul from a visit to Pyongyang, held a press conference today at the Beijing International Club. He discussed his trip from March 25 to April 3.

	He said that this visit to discuss national reunification with Chairman Kim Il-sung and other leaders yielded more than expected.

	He introduced, "I have always believed that North and South, for happiness and prosperity, as a single ethnic community, should firmly establish the foundation of this community. I hope that compatriots at home and abroad, and more people, will visit and engage in South-North exchanges. This is also the spirit of President Roh Tae-woo's '7.7 Declaration.'"

	He said that the division of South and North has been nearly 50 years, which is a shame for the nation. To overcome difficulties and achieve reunification, the people of the South and North should do their best. He also called on the whole world to care about the issue of Korean reunification.

　　南朝鲜牧师文益焕在京谈平壤之行
    本报北京４月４日讯  记者周必忠报道：南朝鲜牧师文益焕在访问平壤回汉城途中，今天在北京国际俱乐部举行记者招待会，介绍他３月２５日至４月３日的此行。
    他说，这次同金日成主席和其他领导共商祖国统一问题，收获比预期的还大。
    他介绍说：“我一向认为，北方和南方，为了幸福和繁荣，作为一个民族共同体，应牢固打好这个共同体的基础，愿国内外的同胞、更多的人士进行访问和南北交流。这也是卢泰愚总统‘７·７宣言’的精神。”
    他说，南北分裂将近５０年，这是民族的耻辱。为了克服困难，得到统一，南方和北方的民众应该全力以赴。他还呼吁全世界都来关心朝鲜的统一问题。
