Residents' Savings: Smart Arrangement

Q: On February 1, banks adjusted interest rates again. Some readers have written in to ask which of the fixed-term deposits for three years, five years, or eight years offers the highest returns?

A: The annual interest rate for an eight-year term is 17.64%. If calculated using the February announced value-preservation supplement rate of 12.71%, 100 yuan of principal stored for eight years, then converting the principal, interest, and value-preservation supplement into a two-year term, over ten years you can get 426.52 yuan. However, the term is quite long, and there are many variables, so you need to consider it carefully when depositing. If you store 100 yuan of principal for five years and then convert it into another five-year term, due to two value-preservation supplements, over ten years you can get 567.29 yuan. If you store 100 yuan of principal for three years, then convert the principal, interest, and value-preservation supplement into two consecutive three-year terms, and then convert it into a one-year term, over ten years you can get 621.60 yuan. It is clear that choosing a three-year fixed-term deposit offers the highest returns.

If the depositor feels that ten years is too long, they can first store 100 yuan of principal in a three-year term, then after maturity, convert the principal, interest, and value-preservation supplement into a one-year term. In four years, you can get 197.62 yuan, almost doubling the principal.

Q: Besides these, which other types of savings offer higher returns?

A: In this interest rate adjustment, the interest rates for fixed-term deposits with interest payments, fixed-term deposits for overseas Chinese, fixed-term deposits with regular savings, and combined savings and current accounts have also been increased. Among these, the fixed-term deposits for overseas Chinese have the highest interest rate and thus the highest returns. If convenience is a priority, depositors can choose combined savings and current accounts, which allow for withdrawals at any time and offer preferential interest rates. Fixed-term deposits with interest payments not only enjoy value-preservation supplements but also provide a certain amount of interest income every month (every quarter).

If you combine fixed-term deposits with interest payments and regular savings for a five-year term, the returns may be even more significant. For example, if you deposit 1000 yuan in a five-year fixed-term deposit with interest payments, agreeing to withdraw interest once a month, and then deposit the interest into a five-year regular savings account each month, after five years, the interest will be: the interest for a five-year fixed-term deposit with interest payments is 657 yuan, with 10.95 yuan withdrawn each month; each month, 10.95 yuan (which can be rounded to 11 yuan) is deposited, and after five years, the interest is 219 yuan; the total interest from both is 876 yuan. Compared to the interest of 747 yuan obtained from a similar amount in a five-year fixed-term deposit, the former earns 129 yuan more in interest (value-preservation supplements are not included).

Q: Among the three fixed-term deposits of six months, one year, and two years that do not have value-preservation supplements, which term is the most cost-effective?

A: If a depositor stores 100 yuan in a six-month term, then converts it three times, in two years you can get 119.22 yuan; if stored in a one-year term and then converted once, in two years you can get 123.93 yuan; if stored in a two-year term, after maturity you can get 124.48 yuan. It is not difficult to see that the two-year term is the most cost-effective.

　　居民储蓄巧安排
    问：今年２月１日银行再度调整利率，一些读者来信询问，在整存整取三年、五年、八年的定期存款中，哪种收益最高？
    答：八年期存款年息为１７．６４％，若按２月份公布的保值贴补率１２．７１％计算，１００元本金存足八年后再将本息及保值补贴转存两年，前后十年可得４２６．５２元。但其期限较长，变化因素多，故存款时要考虑周全。若将１００元本金存足五年后再转存一个五年期，由于有两次保值补贴，前后十年可得５６７．２９元。若将１００元本金存足三年后，用本息及保值补贴连续两次转存三年定期，然后再转存一年期，前后十年可得６２１．６０元，可见，定期整存整取选择三年期收益最高。
    如果储户觉得十年时间过长，可先将１００元本金存入三年期，到期后把本息及保值补贴再转存一年期，四年可得１９７．６２元，本金接近翻了一番。
    问：除此之外，其他储蓄种类中哪些收益较高？
    答：在此次利率调整中，定期存本取息、定期华侨整存整取、定期零存整取、定活两便的利率也有所提高。其中华侨整存整取利率最高收益相应也最高。如为了存取方便，储户可选择定活两便，不但随时可取，利息也较优惠。存定期存本取息，既享受保值补贴，又可以每月（每季）获得一定利息收入。
    若将存本取息和零存整取五年期储蓄结合起来，收益恐怕更为可观。例如，将１０００元存入存本取息五年期，约定每月取息一次，然后将利息每月再转存零存整取五年期，五年后利息为：存本取息五年期利息为６５７元，每月取息１０．９５元；每月存入１０．９５元（可凑整为１１元），五年后利息为２１９元；两项利息相加为８７６元。与同样金额整存整取五年期得到的利息７４７元相比，前者比后者多得利１２９元（保值补贴未包括在内）。
    问：在半年、一年、两年这三种没有保值补贴的定期存款中，选择哪个档次存储合算？
    答：储户若将１００元存入半年期，到期后再转存三次，两年可得１１９．２２元；若存入一年期，再转存一年，两年可得１２３．９３元；若存入两年期，到期后可得１２４．４８元。不难看出，两年期是比较合算的。
