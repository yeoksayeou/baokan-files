"The Story of 'Red Star Over China' and Me" Essay Contest Results Announced

New China News Agency, Beijing (Trainee Wen Min) To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the publication of the Chinese version of "Red Star Over China" by the famous journalist Edgar Snow, a joint essay contest titled "The Story of 'Red Star Over China' and Me" was held by People's Daily, China Construction Magazine, and six other publications. The results were announced on April 25 in Beijing. Fifteen articles by 15 authors, including Hua Junwu and Margaret Stuart (USA), were selected as the best entries.

More than 50 years ago, Snow, as the first Western journalist to enter the revolutionary base in northern Shaanxi, completed "Red Star Over China" (also known as "The Story of 'Red Star Over China'") after a difficult interview process. This book, which first introduced the true situation of the Chinese revolution to the world, caused a huge sensation upon its release. Today, the book has been translated into 20 languages and is widely circulated around the world.

It is reported that the winning articles and related commentaries and essays of "The Story of 'Red Star Over China' and Me" will be compiled into a book by the International Cultural Publishing Company and distributed both domestically and internationally.
