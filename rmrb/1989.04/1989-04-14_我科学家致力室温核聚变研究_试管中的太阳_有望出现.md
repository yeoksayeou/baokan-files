Chinese scientists from several research institutions are currently dedicated to researching nuclear fusion at room temperature, attempting to replicate the "sun in a test tube" claimed by Professor Martin Fleischmann of the University of Southampton in the UK and Professor Stanley Pons of the University of Utah in the US in late March.

Fleischmann and Pons' experiment is said to have achieved nuclear fusion reactions of hydrogen atoms at room temperature. This reaction is the main source of solar energy and usually occurs under extremely high temperatures of several million degrees Celsius. If the experiment conducted through electrochemical methods at room temperature is verified, it could potentially solve the energy crisis humanity faces, providing an inexhaustible energy source.

It is understood that the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Physics and the Department of Technical Physics at Beijing University are currently conducting experiments. So far, no neutron radiation, which indicates the occurrence of nuclear fusion, has been detected. A technical staff member told the reporter that it is said this experiment requires more than 100 hours to yield results, and currently, their experiment has only been conducted for over 40 hours, so no conclusion can be drawn. The Isotope Laboratory of Peking University's Department of Chemistry has designed another device, and their experiment began today.

　　我科学家致力室温核聚变研究
　　“试管中的太阳”有望出现
    本报北京４月１３日讯　记者叶紫报道：中国数家研究机构的科学家目前正致力于在室温条件下实现核聚变的研究，试图重现英国南安普敦大学马丁·弗莱希曼教授和美国犹他大学斯坦利·庞斯教授在上下旬宣称获得的“试管中的太阳”。
    弗莱希曼和庞斯的实验据称实现了氢原子在室温下的核聚变反应，这种反应是太阳能量的主要来源，通常发生在几百万摄氏度的高温条件下。如果在室温条件下通过电化学方法进行的实验被证实的话，那么有可能彻底解决人类面临的能源危机，获得取之不竭的能源。
    据悉，中科院物理所、北京在学技术物理系的实验正在进行之中，目前还没有探测到标志着核聚变确已发生的中子辐射。一位科技人员告诉记者，据说这种实验要进行１００个小时以上才能有结果，而目前他们的实验才进行了４０多个小时，还不能下定论。北大化学系同位素室设计了另一装置，其实验已于今天开始。
