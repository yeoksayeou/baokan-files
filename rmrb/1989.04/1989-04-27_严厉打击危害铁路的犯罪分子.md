Today, this newspaper exposed the facts of some lawless elements harassing passenger trains and endangering railway transportation. It also reported on some railway public security departments' efforts to address this issue by rectifying the chaotic railway public order (see page 5, "Facing the Thugs Who Endanger Passenger Trains"). Severely cracking down on lawless elements who commit crimes on trains is the voice of the people and should be given high attention.

In recent times, some thugs not only commit theft and robbery on trains but also loot railway transportation materials and sabotage railway facilities, threatening the personal safety of passengers and causing serious losses to state property. The main reasons for this situation are that lawless elements trample on the law, act brazenly, and seize opportunities to commit crimes. Some people regard "eating off the railways" as a way to make money and earn a living. On the other hand, it is also related to the fact that law enforcement departments and relevant personnel have not been strong enough in striking and punishing these lawless elements. Experience has shown that any behavior that disrupts and damages state property and personal safety is illegal and unpopular. We should firmly believe in this truth: in a society where the people are masters, it should be the criminals who fear the people, not the people who fear the criminals. Therefore, all destructive forces, no matter how rampant they are, will be effectively curbed if they are severely punished. Currently, the broad masses of public security officers and other law enforcement personnel on the railways should have more confidence and a clearer understanding of this.

Of course, the security on trains is part of the overall social security and is constrained by the overall social security situation. To truly change the security situation on trains and give passengers a sense of security, in addition to strengthening the railway's own security work, comprehensive management is also needed. Fundamentally, it is necessary to implement the Party Central Committee's policy of simultaneously promoting material civilization and spiritual civilization, so that cadres and the masses in all sectors can develop the habit of consciously observing laws and regulations. This is a fundamental measure to improve railway safety.

To achieve the goal of fundamental improvement, on the one hand, the railway security departments need to strengthen their work, and on the other hand, Party and government organizations at all levels, as well as mass organizations, should also cooperate and coordinate. In particular, the leaders of Party committees and governments at all levels should put this major issue, which relates to national and people's livelihoods, on the agenda and work together to improve social order and manage railway transportation.

The rectification of the railway environment and the maintenance of railway order, as well as the crackdown on criminal activities, are also the responsibility of the broad masses of passengers. From the perspective of the railway department, it is undoubtedly necessary to provide a safe environment for passengers. From the perspective of passengers, they should also actively cooperate and have the right and duty to stop those who affect passenger safety. The railway security departments, security departments along the railway routes, judicial organs, and the broad masses of passengers should all work together to block the opportunities for criminals to cause trouble, reduce unsafe factors, and create a truly safe environment for railway transportation.

　　严厉打击危害铁路的犯罪分子
    本报评论员
    今天，本报披露了一些不法之徒骚扰旅客列车、危害铁路运输的事实，报道了一些铁路公安部门，为解决这个问题，对铁路治安秩序混乱进行的整治（见五版《面对危害旅客列车的歹徒》）。严厉打击在列车上为非作歹的不法分子，是人民群众的呼声，应引起高度的重视。
    一个时期以来，一些歹徒不仅在列车上进行盗窃抢劫，而且哄抢铁路运输物资，破坏铁路设施，使旅客的人身安全受到威胁，也使国家财产受到严重损失。造成这种情况的原因，主要是不法之徒践踏法律，大胆妄为，伺机作案，一些人把所谓“吃”铁路当成了发财、谋生的途径；另一方面也与执法部门和有关人员对这些不法之徒打击不力、制裁不严有关。事实证明，任何对国家财产和人身安全的骚扰破坏行为，都是违法的、不得人心的。我们应该坚信这样一条真理：在人民当家作主的社会里，只能是犯罪分子怕人民，不应该是人民怕犯罪分子。因此各种破坏势力，不管它们多么猖獗，只要严惩不贷，就会收到立竿见影的效果。铁路上的广大公安干警和其他执法人员，目前要更加坚定地树立这种信心，明确这种认识。
    当然，列车上的治安是整个社会治安的一个部分，是受整个社会治安制约的。要真正改变列车治安状况，让旅客有充分的安全感，除了加强铁路自身治安工作之外，还要进行综合治理。从根本上来说，就是要贯彻执行党中央关于一手抓物质文明建设，一手抓精神文明建设的方针，使各行各业的干部与群众，养成自觉遵纪守法的习惯。这是提高铁路安全的治本措施。
    为了达到治本的目的，一方面铁路治安部门要加强工作，另一方面各级党政组织，群众团体也要协同配合，尤其是各级党委和政府的负责人，更应把这项关系国计民生的大事摆到议事日程上来，齐心协力把社会治安秩序整顿好，把铁路运输管理好。
    治理铁路环境，整顿铁路秩序，打击犯罪分子的破坏行为，同样也是广大旅客自己的事。从铁路部门来说，无疑要为旅客提供安全的环境，从旅客来说，也要积极配合，对于那些影响旅客安全的人和事，广大旅客都有权利有义务进行制止。铁路治安部门、铁路沿途治安部门、司法机关、广大旅客大家同心协力，就可以堵塞坏人作乱的可乘之机，减少不安全的因素，使铁路运输真正有一个安全的环境。
