Title: Concerns About Awarding Excellence

Recently, the author attended a product excellence award ceremony. The ceremony was held at the Great Hall of the People, quite grand indeed. What surprised the author was that out of the hundreds of enterprises participating in the evaluation, almost all of them won awards. There were so many winners that they couldn't all come up on stage to receive their awards, so they had to go to the hall afterwards to collect their prizes. Wow! In the hall, travel bags filled with trophies were lined up one after another, densely packed in a large area. Hundreds of people swarmed in, each looking for their own prize, bustling and chaotic, like they were rushing to buy some bargain in a market.

Nowadays, there are indeed too many and too many product excellence awards. National, regional, industry-specific, departmental... government departments, associations, academic societies, and media organizations... the list goes on, varied and numerous. Regardless of whether the enterprise is relevant or not, and regardless of whether it has authority, it seems that anyone can gather a group of people, raise a banner, and order enterprises to participate in the evaluation. With so many awards, it's inevitable that the word "excellent" loses its value. Many awards are given to everyone, with everyone receiving a trophy. Personal favors, connections, and money awards are mixed together, and many products are named excellent but do not live up to their names. Once a product wins an award, it's like sitting in an iron chair, regardless of its quality in the future, the trophy is good for life. Haven't you seen that some product advertisements state that the product has won the National Economic Commission's Excellent New Product Golden Dragon Award? In fact, this Golden Dragon Award was given in 1983, and it has been five or six years since then. The new product has long become an old product, but the Golden Dragon is still dancing for what?

Awarding has become a way for some people to make money. Some people are enthusiastic about organizing exhibitions and competitions. In addition to providing a few samples, participating enterprises also have to pay a few thousand yuan, with money flowing into the organizers' hands. No one knows where the money goes, and naturally, there is some shady business involved. Enterprises pay the money, and the trophies are just lined up and distributed. To put it bluntly, this kind of excellence award is no different from a few people colluding to deceive consumers.

Many award activities are organized by government departments. The intention to encourage enterprises to produce high-quality products is good, but too many awards inevitably cause trouble for enterprises. This administrative evaluation does not necessarily have a good effect. In a market economy, who is excellent is decided by the market, and consumers are the final judges. The government should manage less of what the market can handle and more of what the market cannot handle. Currently, many products are in a seller's market, and the circulation order is chaotic. Counterfeit and substandard products are rampant, and consumers are complaining. Government departments should focus more on punishing substandard products to protect consumers' legal rights. The State Bureau of Technical Supervision inspecting product quality and publishing the names of substandard product manufacturers is a good approach.

Excellence awards should be fewer and better. In addition to a few nationwide product quality awards organized by national authoritative departments, layer-upon-layer and multi-party evaluations should be restricted. The title of excellent product should not be a lifetime appointment.

　　评优之忧
　　皮子
    不久前，笔者参加了一个产品评优发奖大会。大会在人民大会堂举行，够气派的。令笔者吃惊的是参评的几百家企业几乎家家获奖，以致于奖者太多，不能一一上台领奖，只好会后到大厅里去拿奖。嗬！大厅里，装着奖杯的旅行包一个挨着一个，密密麻麻摆了一大片，几百人蜂拥而上，寻找着属于自己的那份奖品，熙熙攘攘，好不热闹，就像是在市场上抢购什么便宜货。　　
    如今，各种产品评优着实太多、太滥。全国的、地方的、行业的、部门的……，政府部门办的，协会学会办的，新闻单位办的……，名目繁多，五花八门。不管与企业搭不搭界，也不管是否具有权威性，好像什么人都可以拉起一拨人马，打出一个旗号，号令企业参评。评奖一多，难免优字贬值。不少评奖是人人有份、家家捧杯，人情奖、关系奖、金钱奖混杂其间，许多产品优名难副。产品一旦得了奖，也就坐上了铁交椅，不管日后质量如何，奖牌终身受用。君不见，一些产品广告都标明该产品曾获国家经委优秀新产品金龙奖，其实，这金龙奖是１９８３年颁发的，时已过去五六年了，新产品早已成了老产品，金龙还舞个什么劲呢？
    评奖成了一些人的生财之道。有人热衷于组织什么博览、什么大赛，除了提供若干样品，参加的企业还要交个万儿八千的，钱源源流进组织者手中，到底花在何处，没人弄得清楚，当中自然少不了猫腻。企业花了钱，奖杯也就只能排排坐、分果果了。这种评优，说句难听的话，无异少数人合伙哄骗广大消费者。
    评奖活动由政府部门组织的不少。鼓励企业多生产优质产品的初衷不错，然而，评奖太多，难免给企业添乱，这种行政性评奖，效果也不见得好。须知，商品经济条件下，产品谁优，市场就是竞赛场，消费者是最终的裁判者，用不着总是由上边儿发个优质称号。该由市场来管的事，政府部门就应少管，而应多管市场管不了的事。当前，许多产品是卖方市场，流通秩序混乱，假冒商品、劣质商品泛滥，消费者叫苦不迭，政府部门更应在罚劣上多下功夫，以保护消费者的合法权益。国家技术监督局抽查产品质量，公布劣质产品生产厂家名单，就是一个好办法。
    评优要少而精，除了国家权威部门主办的少数全国性产品质量评奖，应限制层层评奖、多方评奖。优质产品称号也不能搞终身制。
