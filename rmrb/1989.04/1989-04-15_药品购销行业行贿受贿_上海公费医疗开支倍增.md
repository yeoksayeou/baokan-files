Bribery and corruption in the drug procurement industry have become severe, contributing to the rise in public medical expenditures in Shanghai. In 1986, the city's public medical spending was 54 million yuan, but it surged to 102 million yuan last year, nearly doubling.

From late February to early April this year, the Shanghai Procuratorate investigated and solved 38 cases of bribery and 5 cases of bribe-giving in the drug procurement industry. Sixteen individuals were found to have accepted bribes exceeding 100,000 yuan, with some receiving as much as 70,000 yuan.

In recent years, as the national drug market opened up and allowed hospitals and pharmacies to purchase drugs independently, some drug manufacturers and procurement personnel engaged in bribery and collusion. They pushed and procured large quantities of slow-moving, low-quality, high-priced, and even near-expired drugs.

A business representative from a medical supply station in Guangxi province was sold thousands of bottles of slow-moving leaf-preserved penicillin when purchasing scarce drugs in Shanghai. Using the tactic of offering high rebates, he resold this batch of slow-moving drugs back to Shanghai. Two procurement personnel, after receiving 18,000 yuan in rebates, purchased 1,800 bottles in one go. A procurement employee at Nanxiang Hospital in Jiading County, after accepting a bribe, bought over 1,000 boxes of glucose saline from a pharmaceutical factory in Jiangxi. Upon testing, the mold rate was found to be between 10% and 15%. According to three drug sales representatives from outside provinces and cities, they had bribed Shanghai drug procurement personnel with over 200,000 yuan in the past one or two years.

　　药品购销行业行贿受贿
　　上海公费医疗开支倍增
    据新华社上海４月１４日电　（记者陈毛弟）上海药品购销行业中行贿受贿现象严重，成为公费医疗费用上升的原因之一。１９８６年全市公费医疗开支为５４００万元，去年竟增至１．０２亿元，上升了近一倍。
    从今年２月下旬至４月上旬，上海市检察机关共侦破药品购销中的受贿案３８起、行贿案５起，受贿万元以上的１６人，有的受贿金额达７万余元。
    近几年全国药品市场开放，允许各医院、药店自行进药后，少数药厂推销人员与药品采购人员行贿受贿，相互勾结，大量推销和收购滞销的、质低价高的、甚至接近过期的药品。
    广西一家医药站的业务员从上海收购一批紧俏药品时，被“搭售”数千瓶滞销的叶保西林。他采取给高额回扣的手段，又把这批滞销药返销上海。两名采购员在收受１８０００元回扣后，一次购入了１８００瓶。嘉定县南翔医院一名采购员受贿后，买进江西一家药厂生产的１０００多箱葡萄糖盐水，经化验，霉变率达１０％至１５％。据三名外省、市的药品推销人员交待，近一两年内，他们共向上海市药品采购人员行贿２０余万元。
