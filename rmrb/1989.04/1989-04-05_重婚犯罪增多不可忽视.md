In recent years, bigamy crimes have been on the rise in some areas. According to statistics from 8 counties and 1 city in Shangqiu region of our province, the procuratorial organs have handled 85 bigamy cases from 1985 to July 1988, with 42 cases involving 61 people. In 1985, 5 cases were filed, in 1986, 6 cases were filed, in 1987, the number of cases filed increased to 15, and from January to July 1988, 16 cases were filed.

The reasons for the increase in bigamy cases are varied. They include social roots, as well as factors such as criminals seeking comfort and pleasure; they include both illiterates and those ignorant of the law; some abandon their wives to take concubines for fun, while others take concubines for the sake of having heirs; some are arranged by parents, while others are due to "changing partners"; some are due to marital discord and divorce not being allowed, while others take advantage of lax scrutiny by registration authorities. There are many reasons.

This trend of increasing bigamy crimes cannot be ignored and should be of concern to the whole society. Relevant departments should seriously carry out legal education to improve citizens' legal awareness. Marriage registration authorities should strictly examine and plug loopholes. Judicial organs should punish bigamy crimes according to law.

### 重婚犯罪增多不可忽视

　　重婚犯罪增多不可忽视
    近几年来，一些地方重婚犯罪案件呈现上升趋势。据我省商丘地区８县１市的统计，检察机关从１９８５年至１９８８年７月底共受理重婚犯罪案件８５起，立案４２起６１人。１９８５年立案５起，１９８６年立案６起，１９８７年立案数上升到１５起，１９８８年１月至７月立案１６起。
    重婚案件上升的原因是多种多样的。既有社会根源，也有犯罪者贪图安逸、追求享乐等因素；既有文盲，也有法盲；既有弃妻纳妾图快活的，也有为传宗接代而纳妾的；既有父母包办的，也有“转亲”造成的；既有感情不和，离婚不准的，也有登记机关审查不严钻空子的，等等。
    这种重婚犯罪案件逐年上升的趋势不容忽视，应引起全社会的重视。有关部门要认真抓好普法教育，切实提高公民的法制观念。婚姻登记机关要认真审查，堵塞漏洞。司法机关对于重婚犯罪要依法惩处。
