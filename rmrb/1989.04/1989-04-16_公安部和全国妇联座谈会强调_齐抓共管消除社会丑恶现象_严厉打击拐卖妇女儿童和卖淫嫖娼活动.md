The Public Security Ministry and the All-China Women's Federation held a joint meeting emphasizing the need for joint efforts to eliminate social evils. The meeting stressed the severe punishment of the trafficking of women and children and prostitution activities.

	The People's Daily, Beijing, April 15—Xú Rújùn, People's Daily reporter, and Zhāng Chūn, Xinhua News Agency intern, report: In New China, the crimes of trafficking women and children, as well as the evil practices of prostitution, had already been eradicated for many years. However, in recent years, these phenomena have reemerged in some regions of our country. Yán Míngfù, a member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, recently at a joint meeting held by the Public Security Ministry and the All-China Women's Federation, demanded that these regions mobilize the entire society to jointly address and manage these issues, take practical measures, enhance the legal awareness of the entire population, and resolutely eliminate these social evils.

	Vice Minister of Public Security Yú Léi reported on the situation and opinions regarding the Public Security Bureau's crackdown on the trafficking of women and children, as well as the prohibition and elimination of prostitution activities.

	According to the reflections of the 15 provincial, municipal, and autonomous region political and legal, public security, and women's federation department heads who attended the meeting, the trafficking of women and children has increased in some places, bringing misfortune to many families. Some women, after being trafficked, have suffered various forms of abuse.

	The attendees believed that prostitution activities have also shown a worsening trend in some regions in recent years. If these social evils are not strictly prohibited and eliminated, they will inevitably corrupt social morals, disrupt social order, and endanger the physical and mental health of the broad masses and future generations.

	State Councilor and Minister of Public Security Wáng Fāng pointed out at the meeting that the reemergence of the trafficking of women and children and prostitution activities is mainly due to some comrades, including some leading comrades, not fully recognizing the severity and harm of these social evils and criminal activities, not paying enough attention, and not taking effective measures to prohibit, eliminate, and crack down on them. The comprehensive management measures are not being implemented. He pointed out that to stop and ultimately eliminate the trafficking of women and children and prostitution activities, we must rely on the strength of the entire society, implement comprehensive management, and focus on improving the quality of citizens.

	Wáng Fāng demanded that all departments strictly implement various specific measures for comprehensive management. The Public Security Bureau and various political and legal departments should work closely together, fully leverage the functions of specialized agencies, continue to implement the policy of severe punishment and swift trials, severely crack down on the trafficking of women and children, resolutely prohibit and eliminate prostitution activities, and decisively stop these two evil trends.

　　公安部和全国妇联座谈会强调
　　齐抓共管消除社会丑恶现象
　　严厉打击拐卖妇女儿童和卖淫嫖娼活动
    本报北京４月１５日讯　本报记者徐如俊、新华社实习生张春报道：在新中国已经绝迹多年的拐卖妇女儿童犯罪活动和卖淫嫖娼的丑恶现象，近几年又在我国一些地区重新滋生。中共中央书记处书记阎明复日前在公安部和全国妇联举行的座谈会上，要求这些地区动员全社会力量齐抓共管，采取切实措施，增强全民的法制观念，坚决消除这些社会丑恶现象。
    公安部副部长俞雷在会上通报了公安机关打击拐卖妇女儿童犯罪，查禁取缔卖淫嫖娼活动的情况和工作意见。
    据参加座谈会的１５省、市、自治区政法、公安和妇联等部门负责同志反映，一些地方拐卖妇女儿童犯罪活动增多，给许多家庭带来了不幸。一些妇女被拐卖后遭到各种迫害。
    与会者认为，卖淫嫖娼活动近几年在一些地区，也有日趋严重的势头，如果不对这种社会丑恶现象严加查禁、取缔，势必败坏社会风气，扰乱社会治安，危及广大群众和子孙后代的身心健康。
    国务委员、公安部长王芳在座谈会上指出，拐卖妇女儿童犯罪和卖淫嫖娼活动重新滋生，主要是我们有些同志，包括一些领导同志，对这类社会丑恶现象和犯罪活动的严重性、危害性认识不足，重视不够，组织查禁取缔和打击措施不力，综合治理措施不落实。他指出，要制止并最终消除拐卖妇女儿童犯罪和卖淫嫖娼活动必须依靠全社会的力量，实行综合治理，并着眼于提高公民的素质。
    王芳要求各部门狠抓综合治理各项具体措施的落实。公安机关和政法各部门要密切配合，充分发挥专门机关的职能作用，要继续贯彻依法从重从快的方针，严厉打击拐卖妇女儿童的犯罪行为，坚决查禁取缔卖淫嫖娼活动，务必刹住这两股恶风。
