Vietnam Refuses UN Supervision of Troop Withdrawal, Opposes International Conference on Cambodian Issue

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 8 - The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry today rejected UN supervision of its withdrawal from Cambodia and indirectly opposed Prince Sihanouk's proposal to hold an international conference on the Cambodian issue.

Vietnam announced on April 5 that it would withdraw all its troops from Cambodia by September this year and proposed that India, Poland, Canada, Indonesia, and the UN Secretary-General's personal representative supervise the withdrawal. Prince Sihanouk and some countries believe that the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia should be supervised by the UN rather than by the countries chosen by Vietnam.

In response, the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesman reiterated Vietnam's stance on the April 5 withdrawal statement and accused the UN of taking an unjust position against Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia in the past.

The spokesman claimed, "In the past 10 years, the UN has taken a position in the Cambodian issue that is against one side and in favor of the other. Therefore, the UN cannot play a fair role."

In response to a question about Prince Sihanouk's proposal on April 6 to hold an international peace conference in Paris on the Cambodian issue, the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesman said, "Vietnam hopes that all Cambodian parties, first and foremost Hun Sen and Prince Sihanouk, will meet as soon as possible and reach a consensus on Cambodia's domestic issues, so as to resume the second round of informal meetings in Jakarta and discuss the organization of an international conference on the Cambodian issue."

　　越越南拒绝联合国监督撤军  反对召开柬问题国际会议
    新华社河内４月８日电越南外交部今天拒绝接受由联合国监督其从柬撤军，同时间接地拒绝了西哈努克亲王提出举行柬问题国际会议的建议。
    越南于４月５日宣布在今年９月前从柬全部撤军并提出由印度、波兰、加拿大、印尼和联合国秘书长私人代表来监督。西哈努克亲王和一些国家认为，越从柬撤军应由联合国而不应由越南选择的几个国家来监督。
    对此，越南外交部发言人重申了越南４月５日关于撤军声明的立场，并且指责联合国过去采取反对越南侵柬的立场是不公正的。
    发言人声称：“在过去１０年里，联合国在柬埔寨问题上是站在一方反对另一方。因此，联合国不能起公正的作用。”
    在回答关于西哈努克亲王４月６日提出在巴黎举行关于柬埔寨问题的国际和平会议的建议时，这位越南外交部发言人说，越南希望“所有柬埔寨各方，首先是洪森和西哈努克亲王尽快将举行会晤并就柬埔寨的国内问题达成一致意见，以便恢复第二轮雅加达非正式会晤和讨论关于柬埔寨问题国际会议的组织事宜”。
