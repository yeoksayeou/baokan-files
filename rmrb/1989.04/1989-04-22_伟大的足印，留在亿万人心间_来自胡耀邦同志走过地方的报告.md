The mountains stand in silence, the rivers sing a mournful song. The news of Comrade Hu Yaobang's passing has shaken the vast expanse of our motherland—the mountains and rivers he traversed. His great footsteps are forever etched in the hearts of millions. Our reporters, on the lands where Comrade Hu Yaobang walked, have gathered these bouquets of white flowers in remembrance...

On April 18th, when the people of Hebei were eagerly awaiting Comrade Hu Yaobang's fourth visit to the Taihang Mountains, the tragic news came...

On April 18th, the people of the Taihang Mountains will never forget this "April 18th."

Seven years ago on this day, Comrade Hu Yaobang visited the Yixian mountainous area in Hebei to discuss with local officials and the masses the path to prosperity for the old revolutionary base. As he departed, he said with deep emotion: "In the future, I will try to come to the Taihang Mountains every April 18th."

Comrade Hu Yaobang was indeed very busy, but in 1984 and 1986, he kept his promise and came on this day.

The spring breeze blew gently, and the willows swayed softly. Another "April 18th" has come, but Comrade Hu Yaobang is not here. The news of his passing struck like a thunderbolt, shocking the Taihang Mountains.

The officials and people of Tang County have not forgotten: In the spring of 1984, during Comrade Hu Yaobang's second visit to the Taihang Mountains, he brought with him oil pine and other tree seeds he had bought, and together with everyone, he planted nearly a thousand saplings on the barren hills of Miaogou. During a rest, he also chatted with the farmers who had contracted the barren hills, talking about afforestation and the path to prosperity for the mountain people...

Hu Yaobang visited farmers' homes three times during the Spring Festival, and today, an elderly Zhuang farmer from Guangxi sighs deeply, "What a good person!"

Upon hearing the news of Comrade Hu Yaobang's passing, the elderly Zhuang farmer Yu Zhengxuan took out a photo of himself with Hu Yaobang, remained silent for a long time, and sighed deeply: "What a good person!"

Comrade Hu Yaobang had visited Guangxi six times during his lifetime and spent three Spring Festivals there, including his last Spring Festival.

The elderly farmer Yu Zhengxuan, who had worked with the yellow earth for over half a century, never dreamed on the eve of the Lunar New Year in 1983 that the General Secretary of the Party would suddenly come to his home.

Yu Zhengxuan told the reporter: That night, after Comrade Hu Yaobang arrived at their home, he asked about their warmth, health, and livelihood, inspected their housing, beds, clothes, and even looked at their rice bins, cow sheds, and chicken coops, learning about the difficulties in water supply and the scarcity of forests on the barren hills...

To the surprise of this farming family, Comrade Hu Yaobang never forgot them. On the eve of the Spring Festival this year, Comrade Hu Yaobang visited Nanning again and specially invited Yu Zhengxuan to Nanning for a talk, asking if the barren hills behind their house had been planted with trees and if the problem of drinking water for humans and animals had been solved...

The waters of Xiang River flow endlessly, and the sorrow lingers on. The people of Hu Yaobang's hometown are deeply grieved by the loss of an outstanding son...

The passing of Comrade Hu Yaobang has cast a shadow of sorrow over the Xiangtan region of Hunan. The people of his hometown are deeply grieved by the loss of an outstanding son.

Vice Chairman Zhao Chuqi of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has been immersed in sorrow these days. In the early 1960s, Comrade Hu Yaobang served as the First Secretary of the Xiangtan Regional Committee, and Zhao Chuqi was the Deputy Secretary.

Zhao Chuqi recalled that Comrade Hu Yaobang worked in the Xiangtan Regional Committee from 1962 to 1964. His spirit of seeking truth from facts is unforgettable. During the "Great Leap Forward," we in the Regional Committee did many things that exceeded the people's capacity to bear. About 200,000 people suffered from "edema." We in the Regional Committee felt that we had not done our jobs well and were under great pressure. After Comrade Hu Yaobang arrived, he conducted investigations and research and evaluated our work and the comrades in the Regional Committee in a truthful manner. He said: The comrades in the Regional Committee are all good comrades, all wanting to do good things, but some things exceeded the objective possibilities. After hearing Comrade Hu's words, we felt warm in our hearts, put down our mental burdens, seriously summarized our lessons, corrected our mistakes in work, and the situation quickly improved.

In Shaanxi, where Comrade Hu Yaobang had long fought and worked, the "old leader's" spirit of seeking truth from facts and daring to speak out is highly praised...

Shaanxi is where Comrade Hu Yaobang had long worked. After the Long March reached Shaanbei, he fought and lived here for a full 10 years. From 1964 to 1965, he served as the First Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee for less than a year, but his achievements are numerous and widely praised.

Zhang Zehe, the Chairman of the Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and Chen Yuanfang, the Vice Chairman, recalled the days they worked with Comrade Hu. They believe that this "old leader" is most respected for his honesty and courage to speak the truth, "daring to seek truth from facts and daring to speak out."

Wu Guixian, who grew from a party branch secretary of the Zhao Mengtao group in the former Northwest Cotton Mill No. 1 into an advanced figure, was particularly saddened by Comrade Hu Yaobang's passing. She said with tears, "She will never forget Comrade Hu's concern and guidance."

The news of the tragedy brought tears to the eyes of the National Committee member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the former Chairman of the People's Congress of Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Tian Enbo, as his thoughts returned to the spring of five years ago.

The busy General Secretary remembered that there was still one region in Hubei he had not visited, and in April 1984, he specially came to Enshi to visit the Tujia and Miao people.

The former county magistrate of Enshi County, now the Chairman of the People's Congress, Yu Dafan, clearly remembers that Comrade Hu Yaobang and the local Han and Tujia people called each other "old brother." He and the accompanying Qiao Shi and the Tujia relatives gathered together, raising their cups to toast: "Toasting the old brother!" The word "old brother" made our Tujia people's hearts stick to yours...

The people of Enshi will forever remember the Hu Yaobang who called them "old brother"!

　　伟大的足印，留在亿万人心间    
    ——来自胡耀邦同志走过地方的报告
    本报记者
    千山肃立，万水悲歌。胡耀邦同志逝世的噩耗，震撼着广袤的祖国大地——耀邦同志走过的千山万水。伟大的足印，已铭刻在亿万人的心上。本报记者在耀邦同志走过的土地上，采下这束束悼念的白花……
    “四·一八”，当河北人民盼着耀邦同志四上太行时，却传来了噩耗……
    “四·一八”，太行山区人民难以忘怀的“四·一八”。
    ７年前的这天早晨，胡耀邦同志到河北易县山区考察，同这里的干部群众一起共商老区致富大业。临别时，他深情地说：以后我争取每年４月１８日来太行山看看。
    耀邦同志实在太忙了，但１９８４年和１９８６年这个日子，他都来了。
    春风习习，杨柳依依。又是一个“四·一八”，却不见耀邦同志来。噩耗，晴天霹雳一样地震惊了太行山。
    唐县的干部群众没有忘记：１９８４年春耀邦同志第二次上太行时，带着自己买的油松等树种，在庙儿沟的荒山上和大家一起挥镐种下了近千穴种子。休息时他还和承包荒山的农民说家常，谈绿化，话题不离山区人民的富裕道路……

    耀邦三次春节访农家，壮乡老农今日一声长叹见真情：“好人哪！”……
    听到胡耀邦同志逝世的消息，广西壮族老农玉正萱翻出和胡耀邦合影的照片，沉默良久，一声长叹：好人哪！
    胡耀邦同志生前曾６次到广西，在广西过了３个春节，包括他生命中的最后一个春节。
    那位与黄土地打了半个多世纪交道的老农玉正萱，１９８３年农历大年除夕夜，做梦也想不到，党的总书记会突然来到他家里。
    玉正萱对记者说：那晚耀邦同志来到他们家后，问暖问寒问温饱，察看了住房、床铺、衣服，甚至看了米缸、牛栏、鸡舍，了解到这里饮水困难，荒山少林……
    使这户农家大出意料的是，耀邦同志一直没有忘记他们。今年春节前夕，耀邦同志再次来到南宁，又特地约请玉正萱到南宁叙谈，问屋后的荒山种上树没有，人畜饮水困难解决没有……

    湘水渺渺，哀思悠悠。耀邦同志家乡人民为失去一个优秀儿子悲恸不已……
    耀邦同志逝世，使湖南湘潭地区笼罩着哀愁。家乡人民为自己失去一个优秀儿子而悲恸。
    湖南省顾委副主任赵处琪这几天一直沉浸在悲痛之中。６０年代初期胡耀邦同志担任湘潭地委第一书记时，赵处琪任地委副书记。
    赵处琪回忆说，耀邦同志１９６２年至１９６４年在湘潭地委工作过。他的实事求是的精神，令人难已忘怀。“大跃进”那几年，我们地委办了许多超出群众承受能力的事情。约有２０万人得了“水肿病”。我们地委的同志感到工作没做好，压力很大。耀邦同志来了后，经过调查研究，实事求是地评价了我们的工作和地委的同志，他说：地委的同志都是好同志，都是想办好事，只是有些事超过了客观实际的可能。听了耀邦的话，我们心里热呼呼的，放下了思想包袱，认真总结教训，纠正工作中的错误，形势很快好转。　　　　　　　　（吴兴华）
    在耀邦同志长期战斗、工作过的陕西，“老领导”实事求是、敢于直言的风范有口皆碑……
    陕西是胡耀邦同志长期工作过的地方。长征到达陕北后，他在这里战斗生活了整１０年。１９６４年至１９６５年，他在陕西担任省委第一书记，时间不到一年，建树甚丰，有口皆碑。
    省顾委主任章泽和副主任陈元方回忆和耀邦同志在一块工作的日子。他们认为耀邦这位“老领导”最令人崇敬的是，心里怎么想嘴上就怎么说，“敢于实事求是，敢于直言”。
    吴桂贤，这位昔日由西北国棉一厂赵梦桃小组党小组长成长起来的先进人物，对耀邦同志逝世格外悲痛。她流着泪水说，她永远也忘不了耀邦对她的关怀和教诲。

    当年一声“老大哥”，给土家儿女留下了永久的怀念……
    噩耗传来，泪眼模糊的全国政协委员、鄂西土家族苗族自治州原州人大主任田恩波，思绪回到了五年前的春天。
    日理万机的总书记，惦记着湖北还有一个地区没有去过，１９８４年４月专程来到鄂西看望这里的土家族、苗族儿女。
    当年的来凤县县长、如今的县人大主任虞大远清楚地记得，耀邦同志和当地汉族、土家族人民互称“老大哥”。他和随行的乔石同志和土家族乡亲欢聚一堂，举杯祝酒：“给老大哥敬酒！”一声“老大哥”，使我们土家儿女的心跟您贴到一起……
    鄂西儿女永远怀念着与他们以“老大哥”相称的耀邦！
