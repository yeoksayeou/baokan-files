The Soviet people enjoy reading Chinese publications. The number of residential areas in the Soviet Union subscribing to Chinese publications has increased to over 1,000, and the circulation continues to grow.

The open subscription to Chinese publications began in early 1987. At that time, only two newspapers and five magazines were available for subscription. By 1988, the number of Chinese newspapers and magazines available for subscription had increased to 10 and 95 respectively, with a single issue circulation reaching 28,000. The content of the magazines ranges from politics and economics to stamp collecting and fashion, covering various aspects of social life, providing Soviet readers with a comprehensive opportunity to understand China.

Tass reported that the most popular among readers is the Russian-language monthly magazine "China," which sells over 10,000 copies each month. The circulation of the People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China, in the Soviet Union this year is nearly double that of 1987.
