Over the past few years, the number of private houses in the urban areas of our county has increased significantly.

In 1982, the entire county had fewer than 30 private houses in urban areas, with only a few in the county seat. In the past three years, nearly a thousand private houses have been added each year. In this small county with a population of less than 40,000, 500 private houses are added each year. The large-scale construction of private houses has exposed many problems.

First, public funds are used to acquire land for private housing. Some units, under the guise of minor construction projects, use public funds to acquire land, which is then used by individuals to build private houses. This practice is often initiated by officials.

Second, public housing projects are used as a cover for private occupation. Some township and village enterprises, while building collective housing in the county seat, also construct private houses. The cost of building private houses is also borne by the collective.

Third, houses are built haphazardly in narrow streets and alleys, making some streets narrower. This not only affects traffic and the urban environment but also encroaches on collective interests and evades taxes and fees.

Fourth, there is rampant occupation of arable land for housing construction. Although some people have been fined, this trend persists despite repeated prohibitions.

　　梁平县私房建设管理混乱
    近几年来，我县城镇私房增多。
    １９８２年，全县城镇私房不足３０户，县城只有几家。近３年来，每年却增加近千户私房，不到４万人口的小县城，每年竟增加５００户私房。大规模兴建私房存在着许多问题。
    一、公款征地建私房。有些单位以零星基建为名，用公款征用土地，再由个人集资建私房，此举多是干部所为。
    二、名曰建公房，实为私人占。有的乡村企业在县城征用土地搞集体建房的同时兼造私房。建私房的费用也由集体负担。
    三、在小街小巷乱修建，致使一些街道越来越窄，既影响交通和城市环境，又侵占集体利益，偷漏税费。
    四、滥占耕地建房比比皆是。有的人虽然受到了罚款处理，但这种倾向却屡禁不止。
