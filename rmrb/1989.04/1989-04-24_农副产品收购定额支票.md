**Consultation Window**

Farmers often receive a type of negotiable instrument instead of cash when they sell agricultural and sideline products to procurement units. Can you explain what kind of voucher this is and how it differs from bank drafts, IOUs, and promissory notes?

This voucher is called an Agricultural and Sideline Product Procurement Fixed-Value Voucher. Procurement units deposit the payment for the goods into a bank, and the bank issues these vouchers to the procurement units. These vouchers are used to pay farmers for their agricultural and sideline products, with a settlement period of ten days.

Fixed-value vouchers differ from general bank drafts in that they are non-nominal, non-replaceable, and can be cashed during the settlement period. Bank drafts, on the other hand, have the amount filled in by the payer, specify the payee and the bank, can be replaced if lost, but cannot be cashed.

Fixed-value vouchers also differ from IOUs and promissory notes. They are legal negotiable instruments. Farmers can use these vouchers to withdraw cash from banks or credit unions, repay loans, or transfer to time deposits. Within the settlement period, they can also be used to pay agricultural taxes, settlement fees, and purchase goods from local commercial or supply and marketing cooperatives. If the vouchers are not cashed within the settlement period, the bank will start calculating interest from the issuance date according to the savings interest rate, which is 90% of the time deposit rate for periods over six months and the savings interest rate for periods within six months.

What are the benefits of using Agricultural and Sideline Product Procurement Fixed-Value Vouchers?

For the state, promoting this settlement method can reduce the amount of currency in circulation, helping to alleviate the tight cash supply during the peak procurement season for agricultural and sideline products. For farmers, carrying fixed-value vouchers is safer and more convenient than carrying cash. If they do not need cash urgently and choose to cash the vouchers later, they can also earn interest.

What should be noted when using Agricultural and Sideline Product Procurement Fixed-Value Vouchers?

When using fixed-value vouchers, one should check if the issuing bank's seal and the issuance date are complete. Commercial and supply and marketing cooperatives should stamp their seal on the back of the vouchers when receiving them for goods and promptly submit them to the bank for settlement. Banks do not cash vouchers received from commercial and supply and marketing cooperatives and do not calculate interest if the settlement period is exceeded. Fixed-value vouchers are negotiable instruments and should be kept securely. If they are stolen or lost, causing financial loss, the holder is responsible.

Procurement units can choose to pay farmers in cash or use fixed-value vouchers when settling the price of agricultural and sideline products. From the perspective of developing a commodity economy, using vouchers for settlement has more advantages than using cash.

　　农副产品收购定额支票
    问：农民交售农副产品时，许多收购单位往往用一种有价证券来代替现金支付货款，能否谈谈这是一种什么样的票据，它与转帐支票、白条、欠条有何不同？
    答：这种票据叫做农副产品收购定额支票，是收购单位将货款交存银行，由银行交给收购单位，用于向农户支付农副产品货款、结算期为十天的票据。
    定额支票不同于一般转帐支票，不记名，不挂失，可在结算期兑付现金。转帐支票票面金额由付款人填写，指定收款人和委托开户银行办理，它可以挂失，但不能兑付现金。
    定额支票也不同于白条、欠条，是具有法律效用的有价证券。农户可凭定额支票向银行或信用社兑付现金、归还贷款、转存定期储蓄；在结算期内可用于交纳农业税、支付承包金和向当地商业、供销部门一次购买商品。超过结算期的，银行从鉴发日开始按照定活两便储蓄计息，即半年以内兑付现金的，按活期储蓄付息；超过半年的，按定期利率的九折付息。
    问：使用农副产品收购定额支票有哪些好处？
    答：就国家而言，推行这种结算办法，可以减少货币投放量，有助于缓解农副产品收购旺季现金供应紧张的状况。对农户来说，携带定额支票显然比携带现金安全、方便。在不急需现金，延期兑付的情况下，还可得到利息。
    问：使用农副产品收购定额支票应注意什么？
    答：在使用定额支票时，要审查签发银行的印章和签发日期是否齐全。商业供销部门销售商品收取的定额支票，应在背面加盖印章，及时送交开户银行办理进帐。银行对商业、供销部门送交的定额支票不兑付现金，超过结算期也不计付利息。定额支票属有价证券，要妥善保管。如因被盗、丢失造成资金损失，由持票人自行负责。
    收购单位在结算农副产品价款时，可由农户自愿选择是支付现金，还是使用定额支票。从发展商品经济的观点看，使用支票结算比现金结算优越性多。
