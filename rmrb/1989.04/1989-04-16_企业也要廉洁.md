Title: Enterprises Must Also Be Clean

On March 24 of this year, the fifth page of People's Daily featured an article by three Xinhua News Agency reporters titled "Anti-corruption Should Not Leave 'Special Zones' Out." The article discussed the achievements of the anti-corruption campaign in the enterprises of Liaocheng, Shandong. This raises an important question: Can enterprises become zones where clean governance is not practiced?

Over the past two years, the Central Committee of the Party has clearly stated: The economy must prosper, and government agencies must be clean. This call has received strong support and endorsement from both Party members and the general public. Party and government officials, who hold various important positions and wield different kinds of power, must strictly adhere to discipline and maintain integrity. This is indeed a major issue that affects the prestige of the Party and government, the hearts of the people, and the success or failure of reform and construction, as well as the smooth implementation of rectification.

The author believes that this alone is not enough. The issue of integrity among enterprise cadres must not be overlooked. Especially in the current situation where the market mechanism is not yet fully developed, administrative intervention still plays a role, and enterprises are still subject to various "bosses," this aspect should not be ignored. As pointed out by the managers of enterprises in Liaocheng: If enterprises become zones where anti-corruption campaigns are not conducted, those who manage people, money, materials, and enterprises will use this as an excuse to impose burdens on us. Other places have also reported that some Party and government officials demand "eating, drinking, taking, and asking" from enterprises; some enterprises have even become their "piggy banks" for arbitrary spending. The annual entertainment expenses can be as little as a few hundred thousand yuan or as much as several million or even tens of millions of yuan, with shocking waste and extravagance.

With the development of socialist commodity economy and the implementation of the manager responsibility system in enterprises, managers are in the position of legal representatives, taking full responsibility for the enterprises, and holding power over personnel, finances, materials, and production, supply, and sales. It is a necessity of the objective situation to demand that they maintain integrity, and it is also a form of protection for them. In recent years, some managers have failed to resist the temptation of money, engaging in embezzlement, bribery, speculation, fraud, and illegal trading, which have become quite common. From this, it can be seen that it is necessary to clearly demand that enterprise cadres maintain integrity.

The author feels that Comrade Qiao Shi's speech at the national discipline inspection work conference held at the beginning of this year is very appropriate: "Maintaining integrity is first and foremost a requirement for Party and government agencies, but it is not just a requirement for Party members in Party and government agencies. It is a common requirement for all Party members on all fronts and at all work posts. As long as one is a Communist Party member, one must maintain integrity. If one cannot do this, one has no right to be a Communist Party member."

### 企业也要廉洁

　　企业也要廉洁
　　寿春
    今年３月２４日，人民日报第五版刊登了新华社三位记者采写的《廉政不能留“特区”》的一篇报道，介绍了山东聊城地区企业进行廉政建设所取得的成效。这里提出了一个重要的问题：企业能不能成为不讲廉洁的“空白区”？
    近两年来，党中央明确提出：经济要繁荣，党政机关要廉洁。这个号召深得党内外群众的支持和拥护。党和国家机关党员干部，身处各种重要岗位，手中握有这样那样的权力。他们是否严守法纪，公正廉洁，这确实是关系到党和政府的威信，关系到人心的向背，关系到改革和建设的成败和治理整顿能否顺利进行的大问题。搞廉政建设，把党政机关作为重点，首先抓住，这就牵住了“牛鼻子”。
    笔者认为，仅此一招还不够。企业干部的廉洁问题也决不能忽视。特别是在当前市场机制发育还不健全，行政干预还在起作用，企业还受制于大大小小“婆婆”的情况下，更不应忽视企业这一层。正如聊城地区厂长、经理们指出的那样：如果企业成了不搞廉政建设的“特区”，那些管人、管钱、管物、管企业的党政干部会以此为借口吃到我们头上，把负担转嫁到企业身上。其他地方也反映，有些党政干部对企业“吃、喝、拿、要”；有的企业甚至成了他们随意开支的“小钱柜”，一年的招待费，少则几万元，多则几十万元、上百万元，挥霍浪费十分惊人。
    随着社会主义商品经济的发展和企业实行厂长、经理负责制，厂长、经理处于法人代表地位，对企业全面负责，手中掌握着人、财、物和产、供、销权力。对他们提出保持廉洁的要求，是客观形势发展的需要，也是对他们的一种爱护。近几年来，有的厂长、经理由于经受不住金钱的诱惑，贪污受贿，投机诈骗，倒买倒卖，已屡见不鲜。由此看来，对企业干部明确提出保持廉洁的要求是必要的。
    笔者觉得，乔石同志在今年初召开的全国纪检工作会议上的讲话说得好：“保持廉洁，首先是对党政机关的要求，但决不仅仅是对党政机关中党员干部的要求，而是对各条战线、各个工作岗位上的所有共产党员的共同要求。只要是共产党员，都必须做到廉洁奉公。如果做不到这一点，就没有资格当共产党员。”
