Over 10,000 Killed in Battle for Jalalabad

		Our correspondent in Islamabad reports: According to the *Pakistan Times* today, since the battle for Jalalabad in Afghanistan began on March 6, over 8,000 fighters have been killed on the mujahideen side, and 2,000 government troops have been killed in Kabul. The battle for Jalalabad has become the deadliest conflict of 1989, with the highest number of direct casualties from fighting.

		The newspaper revealed these figures while quoting comments from diplomatic circles in Kabul on this civil war. The newspaper also reported that the Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman claimed that on April 23 alone, at least 265 people were killed and 123 were seriously injured in Jalalabad, Herat, and Khost. On the same day, the mujahideen fired three rockets at Kabul, resulting in 12 deaths and 21 injuries.

		According to the *Border Mail*, the mujahideen besieging Jalalabad launched an attack from four directions today, marking a significant action taken by the mujahideen since the start of Ramadan. The Kabul-Jalalabad highway remains a contested area. Reports indicate that the mujahideen have repelled 32 attempts by the Kabul government forces to seize this highway. By April 20, the mujahideen had regained control of the highway.

　　贾城之战死者逾万
    本报伊斯兰堡４月２５日电  记者任毓骏报道：据《巴基斯坦时报》今天消息，自３月６日阿富汗贾拉拉巴德之战爆发以来，游击队方面已有８０００多人阵亡，喀布尔守军也有２０００人战死。贾拉拉巴德之战成为１９８９年以来直接死于战火人数最多的战祸。
    这家报纸是在援引驻喀布尔外交界人士对这场内战的评论时披露上述数字的。这家报纸还报道说，阿富汗外交部发言人声称，仅４月２３日一天，在贾拉拉巴德、赫拉特和霍斯特，至少有２６５人阵亡，１２３人受重伤。同一天，游击队向喀布尔市发射了３枚火箭，造成１２人死亡，２１人受伤。
    另据《边境邮报》报道，围攻贾拉拉巴德的游击队今天从四个方面对该城发起进攻，这是进入斋月以来游击队再次采取的一次重要行动。喀布尔—贾拉拉巴德公路仍是双方争夺的目标。据报道，游击队击退了喀布尔政府军抢占这条公路的３２次进攻，到４月２０日，这条公路又被游击队控制。
