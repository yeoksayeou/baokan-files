The U.S. House of Representatives Ethics Committee today accused House Speaker Jim Wright of 69 violations of House regulations in his personal income and other financial activities. The Washington Post reported that this is the first time in U.S. history that a House Speaker has faced such formal charges.

The committee chairman, California Democrat Dickson, read out the committee's statement. He said that Wright had inappropriately received gifts worth $145,000 from a businessman, including paying his wife's salary, providing free or discounted housing, and using a car. Wright also sold a large number of copies of a book he wrote, attempting to evade House limits on outside income. This statement, signed by the committee's 12 members last Thursday, is equivalent to an indictment in legal terms, listing five charges of Wright's violations. It will now proceed to an evidence investigation phase similar to a trial. If his violations are confirmed, Wright will face penalties ranging from fines to expulsion from Congress.

The charges against Wright were first brought last year by Representative Newt Gingrich, a Republican from Georgia, and immediately received support from outside lobbying groups. The House Ethics Committee then hired a special prosecutor, Chicago lawyer William F. Lee, to conduct a preliminary investigation. Lee, with the assistance of eight aides, spent over $1 million over six and a half months, taking testimony from 73 witnesses, and completed a detailed 279-page report in February.

Wright has consistently denied the allegations. He said, "I know in my heart that I have not violated any regulations." Over the weekend, he vowed to "fight to the end" to defend his and his wife's honor.

　　美众议院道德委员会认定
　　赖特议长违反国会法规
    本报华盛顿４月１７日电　记者仓立德报道：美国国会众议院道德委员会今天指控众院议长吉姆·赖特在个人收入及其他经济活动中，有６９处违反了众议院的规定。《华盛顿邮报》说，这是美国历史上首位众院议长受到这样的正式指控。
    道德委员会主席、加利福尼亚州民主党人狄克逊宣读了该委员会声明。他说，赖特以支付其妻薪金、免费或减价居住房屋、使用轿车的形式，从一位商人那里不恰当地接受了价值１４．５万美元的礼物；并大量销售他写的一本书，图谋逃避众院对院外收入的限制。这项声明是上周四由道德委员会的１２名成员签署的，在立法上等同于一项起诉书，列举了赖特违犯规定的５条罪名，此后将转入类似于审判程序的证据调查阶段。如果他的违法行为被确定，赖特将轻则受罚款，重则被议会开除。
    对赖特的控告是去年由众议员、佐治亚州共和党人金格里奇提出的，并立即得到院外活动集团的支持。众院道德委员会随后聘请特别检察官、芝加哥律师费兰展开初步调查。费兰在８名助手协助下花费１００多万美元，历时６个半月，从７３名见证人那里得到证词，于今年２月完成了长达２７９页的详细报告。
    赖特一直否认对他的指责。他说，“我从心眼里知道我不曾违反过任何规定”。他在上周末曾发誓要“奋战到底”，以维护他和他妻子的名誉。
