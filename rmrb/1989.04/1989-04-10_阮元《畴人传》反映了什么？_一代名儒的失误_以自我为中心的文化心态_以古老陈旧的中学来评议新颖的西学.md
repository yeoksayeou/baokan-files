During the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods of the Qing Dynasty, Han learning flourished, with notable scholars from the Wu and Huai regions. In Yangzhou, there were scholars such as Wang Zhong, Jiao Xun, Yuan Mei, Wang Yanshou, Wang Yinzhi, Ren Dachun, and Liu Baonan. These scholars were erudite and discerning, primarily focusing their research on traditional Confucian classics. To understand the classics, they also studied phonetics, etymology, and the meanings of ancient texts to elucidate history. They expanded their research to include geography, astronomy, and calendrical studies. This group of scholars formed a branch of the Qianlong and Jiaqing School known as the Yangzhou School. However, they were conducting their studies in a long-sealed feudal era, and traditional thinking made it difficult for them to break free from the shackles of feudal academia. They inevitably had limitations in their thinking when facing the impact of Western culture. Yuan Mei's compilation of "Biographies of Mathematicians" is a case in point.

Yuan Mei (1764-1849), a native of Yizheng, Jiangsu, held important positions as a governor and was appointed to the Hall of Imperial Counsellors. He served in office for fifty years, maintaining a reputation for integrity and diligence. More importantly, he did not neglect his studies while in office. He was both a prominent official of the Qing Dynasty and a scholar of profound learning. He advocated for the study of classics, emphasizing the importance of phonetics and etymology in understanding ancient texts, and further pursuing the "meaning and principles." He said, "The way of the sages is in the classics, and the classics cannot be understood without interpretation." He also said, "The way of the sages is like a palace, and phonetics and etymology are the pathways. If the pathways are wrong, every step will be astray, how can one enter the hall and chambers?" Throughout his life, he traveled extensively and tirelessly compiled and edited books. He also paid attention to teaching classics to scholars, cultivating talent. In Hangzhou, he established the Institute for the Study of Classics at the foot of Lone Hill by West Lake, and in Guangzhou, he founded the Sea of Learning Hall at the foot of Yuexiu Mountain. He also purchased books and established libraries such as the Lingyin Book Collection and the Jiao Mountain Book Collection to facilitate scholars' reading. His academic achievements and contributions to traditional culture are commendable. The "History of the Qing Dynasty" praises him, saying, "He experienced the prosperity of literature and art in the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras, presiding over the academic world for several decades, and scholars across the country regarded him as a leader," which is not an exaggeration.

In the second year of the Jiaqing reign (1795), Yuan Mei, along with his cousin-in-law Jiao Xun, began compiling "Biographies of Mathematicians," which took thirteen years to complete and resulted in a forty-six-volume work. This book, written in biographical form, records the lives and academic achievements of astronomers, calendrical scholars, and mathematicians from ancient times to the mid-Qing Dynasty, totaling 243 individuals, including 37 Westerners. Yuan Mei claimed that the purpose of compiling this book was to "trace the origins of ancient and modern changes and explore the differences and similarities between the East and West," and to "network ancient and modern, and integrate the East and West." Indeed, this is a pioneering work in the history of Chinese science and technology. However, due to Yuan Mei and Jiao Xun's lack of understanding of the development of Western science and technology, their views were like viewing flowers through mist, not necessarily accurate. Moreover, Yuan Mei followed the prevailing academic view since the early Qing Dynasty that "Western learning originates from Chinese learning," eagerly seeking the origins of Western learning in ancient Chinese texts, using outdated Chinese learning to criticize novel Western learning. In reality, this was a passive resistance to the infiltration of foreign culture with the barriers of traditional culture, inevitably leading to many mistakes.

In the late Ming and early Qing Dynasties, although China's science and technology were developing slowly, they were undoubtedly behind the scientific achievements of contemporaries in Europe such as Copernicus, Galileo, and Newton. Some Chinese scholars acquired limited Western scientific knowledge from Western missionaries and, through their own research, became renowned. From Xu Guangqi and Li Zhizao to Fang Yizhi, Wang Xizhen, and Mei Wending, they were all such individuals. This was commendable. As the main force of thought and culture in the mid-Qing Dynasty, the Qianlong and Jiaqing scholars could have used this as an opportunity to broaden their horizons and actively explore, to enlighten and innovate. However, Yuan Mei exaggerated the achievements of ancient Chinese science and technology. His so-called "exploring the differences and similarities between the East and West" was the saying of some Qing Dynasty scholars who were eager to "integrate the East and West," hoping to prove through the study of Eastern and Western astronomy and calendrical studies that Chinese traditional culture was superior to any "barbarians." This was a cover-up and distortion with traditional beliefs and illusory self-satisfaction, to suppress others and elevate oneself, to comfort oneself.

Yuan Mei's biased views are evident throughout "Biographies of Mathematicians." For example, he believed that "the science of celestial calculations in the Middle Kingdom, from the Han to the Tang, Song, and Yuan Dynasties, generally progressed from shallow to deep, from sparse to dense," praising ancient Chinese astronomy and mathematics as the most precise and complete. He even said, "Since the beginning of civilization, there has been no dynasty like ours that has been blessed by heaven." He belittled the modern natural science knowledge of astronomy, mathematics, and geography brought by Western missionaries such as Matteo Ricci, Adam Schall von Bell, and Ferdinand Verbiest. In his evaluation of Adam Schall von Bell, Yuan Mei fully displayed the arrogant and self-satisfied attitude of a great scholar of the Celestial Empire. He said that Europe was "a small country in the far west," and Adam Schall von Bell was "a minister of a small country." Because "his methods are indeed verified in heaven," he was employed by the "sacred and wise" Qing Dynasty, which was the "heavenly measure" of the court. Adam Schall von Bell once listed forty-two items such as "the earth is actually round," "day and night are not equal," and "leap months are different" to "show the differences in Western methods and prove the inadequacies of Chinese methods." Yuan Mei was not convinced. He found some records in ancient Chinese texts to compare with Western learning, writing:

"Yuan has extensively read historical records and reviewed the words of astronomers and mathematicians, and thus knows that the new methods also collect the strengths of ancient and modern times to form them, not something that foreigners can create alone. The earth is like a sphere, which has already been mentioned in the Ten Chapters of Zengzi. The height of the sun, with the theory of the four movements of the celestial bodies, matches. The difference in the atmosphere is the theory of the movement of the earth's gas. The celestial bodies are different from the sky, which is the theory that the celestial bodies do not attach to the sky. All of these, how do we know they are not from China?... If it must be said that Western learning is beyond the reach of Chinese scholars, then must our great Qing Dynasty's billion-year-old calendar system be asked of Europe?"

Yuan Mei picked out some vague and unscientifically verified thoughts from the ancient Chinese classics to compete with Western scientific knowledge that had been verified by modern science. He used the saying of "the earth has four movements" from the "Book of Changes" in the Eastern Han Dynasty to prove that Western advanced scientific achievements were already present in ancient China. He also looked down on Chinese scholars who "specialize in Western learning and even advocate for it," ridiculing Xu Guangqi and Li Zhizao for accepting Western learning as being deceived by missionaries, saying that Xu and Li were deceived by Adam Schall von Bell and his followers who "exaggerated Western learning to deceive China, and Xu and Li were deceived and did not realize it." He proudly said, "Our country values literature and respects the Dao, and the six arts are flourishing," but Xu Guangqi "did not read ancient books and mistakenly said that Western methods are superior to Chinese methods, knowing only Western methods, how could he know the so-called ancient methods?" Yuan Mei did not realize that following this "ancient path," the ancient China, which was already in a state of decline, would face a crisis under the impact of Western culture. His deep affection for traditional cultural concepts and shallow understanding of Western learning blinded the vision of a great scholar.

In "Biographies of Mathematicians," Yuan Mei's complete denial of Copernicus' heliocentric theory reflects his resistance to the emerging natural science in the West. The Polish astronomer Copernicus (1473-1543) published the theory that the Earth revolves around the Sun and that the Earth rotates on its axis once every day and night, a great discovery that shook the religious and theological view of the universe. Engels called it the declaration of independence of natural science and a challenge to church superstition. Since then, natural science has been liberated from religious shackles and begun to advance rapidly. As early as the Qianlong reign, the Frenchman Jean-Denis Attiret came to China and introduced Copernicus' heliocentric theory and Kepler's three laws of planetary motion. Yuan Mei, at the end of the "Biography of Jean-Denis Attiret" in "Biographies of Mathematicians," denounced it as "his theory, to the extent of reversing positions and reversing movements, is heretical and cannot be used as a model." In the academic world of the feudal era, "heresy" was "treason and lawlessness." Yuan Mei's comments revealed his conservative attitude of cultural exclusion, and his errors were obvious.

There are also some affirmations of Western arts in "Biographies of Mathematicians." For example, Yuan Mei praised Western-made instruments, saying, "Westerners are proficient in geometry, so the instruments they make are extremely precise. The precision of the instruments leads to accurate measurements, and accurate measurements lead to precise calculations. The verification of Western methods in heaven is indeed due to the instruments." He admired Westerners for their "pursuit of ingenuity" and "exhausting their wisdom on this." Although he acknowledged that Western "arts" were good, he still had a rational analytical attitude. Yuan Mei represented the cultural psychology and outdated thinking of Chinese orthodox scholars who centered on themselves and could not adapt to the historical trend, welcoming the dawn of natural science development in the world. At this time, the Han learning that was popular in the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras, like the fate of the Qing Dynasty, was declining from its peak of prosperity and gradually being replaced by the new progressive trend represented by Gong Zizhen and Wei Yuan. This is the inevitable law of history. We cannot demand too much from the ancients, but through this example, it can be said: the acceptance of foreign culture will inevitably be constrained by traditional thoughts; preference for tradition will bring heavy burdens and pay a greater price.

　　阮元《畴人传》反映了什么？
    一代名儒的失误
    以自我为中心的文化心态　以古老陈旧的中学来评议新颖的西学
    左步青
    清代乾嘉时期，汉学鼎盛，著名的有吴皖两派。在扬州地区，则有汪中、焦循、阮元、王念孙、王引之、任大椿、刘宝楠等一批学者。他们学问渊博，识断精审，研究的对象以传统的儒家经学为主。由于要通经，也精通文字音韵、名物训诂，以求解经治史。他们还把研究范围扩大到地理金石、天算乐历等方面。这批学者形成乾嘉学派的分支扬州学派。但是，他们毕竟是在封闭已久的封建时代做学问，传统的思维方式使他们难以冲破封建学术的桎梏，正确对待西方文化的冲击，在思想上不可避免地存在着局限性。阮元编撰的《畴人传》便是一个例证。（畴人指古代专门研究天文、历法、数学的人。）
    阮元（１７６４—１８４９），江苏仪征人，历任督抚要职，拜体仁阁大学士，兼任经筵讲官。他为官五十年，清慎持躬，颇著政声。更可贵的是他在官不废学问，既是有清一代身居显要的名宦，又是造诣精深的一代名儒。他提倡经学，主张通过音韵训诂弄清古代典籍的内容，并进一步讲求“义理”。他说：“圣贤之道存于经，经非诂不明”；又说：“圣人之道，譬若宫墙，文字训诂，其门径也。门径苟误，跬步皆歧，安能升堂入室乎？”他一生宦游，同时孜孜不倦于整理典籍，刊刻图书。他也很注意以经学课士，培养人才，在杭州西湖孤山之麓创办诂经精舍，在广州越秀山麓创立学海堂，自己还购置图书，设立灵隐书藏（图书馆）、焦山书藏，以便利士人阅读。他的治学成绩和对传统文化的贡献是应当肯定的。《清史稿》称他“身历乾嘉文物鼎盛之时，主持风会数十年，海内学者奉为山斗焉”，诚非虚语。
    嘉庆二年（１７９５），阮元约了他的族姐夫焦循开始编撰《畴人传》，历时十三年，成书四十六卷。这是一部用传记体记叙我国从上古到清代中叶天文、历法、数学家生平事略及其学术上成就的著作，共辑录二百四十三人，另有西洋人三十七人。阮元自称编撰这部书的目的在于“溯古今沿革之原，究中西异同之数”，“网络古今，融会中西”。的确，这是我国科技发展史的开山之作。但由于阮元、焦循等人对西方科学技术的发展并不了然，犹如雾中观花，未必真切。而且阮元沿袭清初以来学术界盛行的观点“西学源于中学”，极力从中国古代的载籍中去探求西学的源流，以古老陈旧的中学来评议新颖的西学，实际上是以封闭的传统文化的壁垒消极抵制外来文化的渗入，必然造成许多失误。
    明末清初，我国的科学技术虽然也在缓慢地发展，但与同时期欧洲的哥白尼、伽利略、牛顿等取得的科学成就相比，无疑是落后的。一些中国学者从西方传教士手中接受了有限的西方科学知识，通过自己的钻研，卓然成家，从徐光启、李之藻到方以智、王锡阐、梅文鼎等都是如此。这是难能可贵的。作为清代中叶思想文化主力的乾嘉学者，对待西学东渐的严峻局面，本可以以此为契机，开阔视野，积极探索，以启蒙图新。但阮元却极力夸大中国古代科学技术的成就。他所谓“究中西异同之数”，即是清代一些学者热衷的“会通中西”的说法，希望通过对中西天文历算等两方面的研究，证明中国的传统文化比任何“外夷”要高明。这是用传统的信念，虚幻的自满文饰曲解，以抑彼扬我，自解自慰。
    阮元这些偏颇的看法在《畴人传》一书中随处可见。例如，他认为“中土推步之学（即推算天文历法之学），自汉而唐而宋而元，大抵由浅入深，由疏渐密”，推崇中国古代天文数学最为精审、完备，甚至“自生民以来，未有如本朝之得天者”；“吾中土之法之精微深妙，有非西人所能及者”。他贬低利玛窦、汤若望、南怀仁等西方传教士传入的天文、数学、地理等近代自然科学知识。在评论汤若望时，阮元充分表现了天朝大国名儒大师虚骄自大的态度。他说，欧罗巴是“极西之小国”，汤若望是“小国之陪臣”，以“其术诚验于天”，为“圣圣相传”的大清朝录用，是朝廷“如天之度量”。汤若望曾列举“地形实圆”、“昼夜不等”、“置闰不同”等四十二事“表西法之异，证中术之疏”，阮元很不服气。他从中国古籍中找出一些记载与西学逐一比附，写道：
　　“元尝博观史志，综览天文算学家言，而知新法亦集合古今之长而为之，非彼中人所能独创也。地如圆体，则曾子十篇中已言之。太阳高卑，与考灵曜地有四游之说合。蒙气有差，即姜岌地有游气之论。诸曜异天，即郄萌不附天体之说。凡此之等，安知非出于中国？……使必曰西学非中士所能及，则我大清亿万年颁朔之法，必当问之于欧罗巴乎？”
    阮元从故纸堆中采撷中国古代诸子百家中一些朦胧的、未经科学实证的思想，来和西方经过近代科学检验的科技知识争高低，以一千多年前东汉时《尚书纬·考灵曜》中“地有四游”之说证明西方先进的科学成果都是中国古已有之。他还以尊古崇圣的心情藐视“专力西学，推崇甚至”的中国学者，讥笑徐光启、李之藻等人接受西学是受传教士的蒙蔽，是汤若望辈对西学“夸大其词以眩吾中国，而徐、李诸公受其欺而不之悟也”。他津津乐道“我国家右文尊道，六艺昌明”，而徐光启“不读古书，谬云西法胜于中法，是但知西法而已，安知所谓古法哉？”阮元丝毫没有察觉到循着这条“古道”继续走下去，在西方文化的冲击下，沉疴在身的古老中国即将面临危机。对传统的文化观念一往情深和对西学的肤浅认识，锢蔽了一代名儒的视野。
    在《畴人传》中，阮元对于哥白尼日心说的全面否定，反映了他对西方新兴的自然科学格格不入。波兰天文学家哥白尼（１４７３—１５４３）发表了关于地球围绕太阳运行，地球每昼夜绕地轴自转一周的日心说，这一伟大的发现震撼了宗教神学的宇宙观，恩格斯称之为自然科学发布的独立宣言，是向教会迷信提出的挑战。从此以后，自然科学从宗教的禁锢下解放出来，开始大步前进。早在乾隆年间，法国人蒋友仁来到中国，就已经介绍了哥白尼的日心说和开普勒的行星运动三定律。阮元在《畴人传》的“蒋友仁传”的结尾斥之为“其为说，至于上下易位，动静倒置，则离经叛道，不可为训”。在封建时代的学术界，“离经叛道”就是“悖逆不法”，阮元的评论显露出他在文化上排斥异己的保守心态，其谬误是显而易见的。
    《畴人传》中也有一些对西艺的肯定。如阮元赞赏西方制造的仪器，认为“西人熟于几何，故所制仪象极为精审。盖仪象精审则测量真确，测量真确则推步密合。西法之有验于天，实仪象有以先之”。他佩服西人为了“机巧相尚”而“殚精毕虑于此”。承认西方“器艺”是好的，总算还有一点理性的分析态度。阮元代表了中国正统的士大夫以自我为中心的文化心理和陈旧的思想模式，不能顺应历史的潮流，迎接世界范围自然科学发展的曙光。这时候，风靡乾嘉的汉学也和清王朝的命运一样，正从盛极的顶峰走向没落，逐渐为龚自珍、魏源等为代表的新的进步思潮所代替。这是历史的必然。我们不能苛求于古人，但通过这一事例说明：对外来文化的接受，必然要受到传统思想的制约；偏好于传统，将会带来沉重的负担，付出更大的代价。
