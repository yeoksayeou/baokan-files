**Discussing the Basics of Reporting**

**Q:** Last August, the Supreme People's Procuratorate established a reporting hotline, which has played an active role in effectively investigating illegal and disorderly cases, improving the economic environment, and rectifying economic order. However, currently, many people do not know how to report. Some only know the hotline number but are unaware of the principles, scope, and precautions for reporting. Filing a lawsuit can result in legal responsibility, as stipulated by our country's laws. So, does reporting count as filing a lawsuit? What responsibility does one bear if a report is incorrect?

**A:** To rely on the masses to fight against illegal and criminal activities, eliminate corruption, and maintain the cleanliness of party and government organs, the People's Procuratorate has carried out reporting work. Currently, procuratorial organs mainly use three forms of reporting: telephone reporting, in-person reporting, and letter reporting. The Supreme People's Procuratorate established a Reporting Center on January 10 this year, with the telephone number 541850.

According to the Criminal Procedure Law, the scope of cases accepted by the People's Procuratorate includes: cases of embezzlement, bribery, infringement of citizens' democratic rights, dereliction of duty, and other cases that the People's Procuratorate deems necessary to handle directly, with a focus on embezzlement and bribery cases.

After receiving reports from the masses, the People's Procuratorate, upon review, will directly handle cases where it is deemed that the relevant personnel have committed crimes. If it is deemed that no crime has been committed, cases involving violations of party discipline will be transferred to the disciplinary inspection department for handling, and cases involving violations of administrative discipline will be transferred to the supervisory department for handling. Cases transferred to the disciplinary inspection and supervisory departments, upon review, if deemed to have constituted a crime, will be handled by the procuratorial organs according to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law regarding case jurisdiction.

The People's Procuratorate's reporting work adheres to the following principles: First, rely on the masses, be convenient for the masses, be responsible to the people, and gain the trust of the people. Second, base on facts and follow the law, with everyone equal before the law. Third, for reported cases, "handle through the proper channels, with levels of responsibility," each doing their own job and taking responsibility. Fourth, strictly implement confidentiality, protect reporters according to the law, and pursue legal responsibility for false accusations and framing. Fifth, reporting work accepts social supervision.

The principal leader of the Supreme People's Procuratorate emphasized that the key to reporting work is to grasp the investigation and handling of cases. He personally reviews reporting materials and organizes procuratorial personnel to investigate and handle relevant reporting leads and conduct supervisory inspections.

From the reporting situation in various places, it can be seen that the handling of some reported cases is slow. The main reasons are: First, there are many anonymous reports, with vague content, making verification difficult. Second, economic crimes are often private transactions conducted in secret, with high concealment, making it time-consuming to clarify the facts of the crime. Third, there are many relationships and networks, with significant interference and resistance. Fourth, there are many leads for reported cases, but procuratorial organs lack manpower and funds, resulting in some cases not being handled in a timely manner.

To speed up case handling, procuratorial organs should focus on investigation and handling, strictly act according to the law, and advocate for named reporting, providing as detailed reporting materials as possible.

The People's Procuratorate clearly stipulates the protection of reporters, strictly prohibiting the transfer of reporting materials to the reported units or individuals, and strictly prohibiting the disclosure of the reported case and the reporter's name to the reported units, individuals, and other persons unrelated to the case. For violations of this regulation that result in serious consequences, legal responsibility will be pursued. For retaliation and framing of reporters, once discovered, the severity will be strictly pursued; for those with relatively minor circumstances that do not constitute a crime, they will be transferred to the relevant competent departments for serious handling; for those that constitute a crime, criminal responsibility will be pursued. Local procuratorates have handled some cases of retaliation against reporters, with some being held criminally responsible.

To protect the legitimate rights and interests of the reported individuals, the People's Procuratorate also stipulates that for those who use reporting to fabricate facts, create false evidence, and frame others, the procuratorial organs will investigate and clarify the facts once discovered. If a crime is constituted, criminal responsibility will be pursued. Of course, due to inaccurate understanding of the situation, erroneous or mistaken reporting that results in false accusations is not included in this category.

To encourage the masses to fight against criminals, the procuratorial organs can reward reporters who have made significant contributions. Those with major contributions will be heavily rewarded. Since the reporting work began, some procuratorial organs have rewarded reporters who have made significant contributions, ranging from a few dozen yuan to a few thousand yuan. According to the wishes of the awardees, rewards are generally given in a non-public manner.

The procuratorial organs also stipulate that for each report, except for anonymous or pseudonym reports that cannot be responded to, a response will be given to the reporter. Responses can take the form of telephone, written, or face-to-face communication, handled by the Reporting Center. For reports that do not fall under the jurisdiction of the procuratorial organs and should be transferred to relevant departments for handling, if the report is made by telephone or in person, an immediate response can be given. If the report is made by letter, the procuratorial organs should respond within 7 days of receiving the reporting letter, stating the reasons for transfer, the transferred department, and the time. For reported cases under the jurisdiction of the procuratorial organs, if the procuratorial organs decide not to file a case, the reasons for not filing a case will be notified to the reporter. If the reporter has objections, they can request a review. The procuratorial organs should seriously handle the reporter's request for review; for already concluded reported cases, the handling results should be promptly notified to the reporter.

　　谈谈举报常识
    问：去年８月，最高人民检察院设立了举报电话，这对有效地查处违法乱纪案件，治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序起了积极作用。但是，目前有不少人不知道怎么举报，有的人只知道举报电话号码，不了解举报原则、范围和注意事项等。告状要负法律责任，这是我国法律明文规定的。那么，举报算不算告状，举报错了应负什么责任？请你报作一详细介绍。

    答：为了依靠人民群众同违法犯罪行为作斗争，清除腐败现象，维护党政机关廉洁，人民检察院开展了举报工作。目前，检察机关主要采用电话举报、当面举报和信函举报３种形式。最高人民检察院已于今年１月１０日成立举报中心，电话号码是５４１８５０。
    根据刑事诉讼法的规定：人民检察院受理举报案件的范围是：贪污罪案、受贿罪案、侵犯公民民主权利罪案、渎职罪案以及人民检察院认为需要自己直接受理的其他案件，重点是贪污、受贿罪案。
    人民检察院接到群众举报线索后，经审查认为有关人员构成犯罪的，就直接查处；认为不构成犯罪的，属于违反党纪的转纪检部门处理，属于违反政纪的转监察部门处理。纪检、监察部门受理的案件线索，经审查后认为已构成犯罪的，按刑事诉讼法关于案件管辖的规定，转检察机关处理。
    人民检察院举报工作遵循下列原则：一、依靠群众，方便群众，对人民负责，取信于民。二、以事实为根据，以法律为准绳，公民在法律面前人人平等。三、对举报案件，“归口办理，分级负责”，各司其职，各负其责。四、严格保密制度，依法保护举报人，依法追究诬告陷害行为。五、举报工作接受社会监督。
    最高人民检察院主要负责人强调把查处工作作为举报工作的关键环节来抓，并亲自阅批举报材料，组织检察人员查处有关举报线索，进行督促检查。
    从各地的举报情况看，现在有些地方的举报案件查处进展慢，其主要原因是：一、匿名举报多，举报内容不具体，查证相当困难。二、经济犯罪大多是私下交易，暗地进行，隐蔽性大，查明犯罪事实颇费时间。三、关系网多，干扰、阻力比较大。四、举报案件线索多，检察机关人力不足，经费缺乏，致使一些案件未能得到及时查处。
    为加快办案速度，检察机关要抓紧查处，严格依法办事，同时要提倡署名举报，尽可能提供详尽的举报材料。
    人民检察院明确规定保护举报人，严禁将举报材料转给被举报单位或被举报人，严禁将举报案情、举报人姓名，向被举报单位、被举报人及其他与办案无关的人员泄露。对违反这一规定，造成严重后果的，要依法追究其刑事责任。对举报人进行报复陷害的，一经查实，视情节轻重，严格追究；其中情节较轻，尚不构成犯罪的，转请有关主管部门严肃处理；构成犯罪的，追究其刑事责任。各地检察院已处理了一些打击报复举报人的案件，有的依法追究了刑事责任。
    为了保护被举报人的合法利益，人民检察院还规定，对利用举报，捏造事实，制造伪证，陷害他人的，检察机关一经发现，就要查明事实。构成犯罪的，即追究其刑事责任。当然，由于了解情况不准确，发生错告、误告而检举失实的，不在此例。
    为了鼓励群众同犯罪分子作斗争，检察机关可酌情奖励举报有功人员。有重大贡献的，要给予重奖。开展举报工作以来，一些检察机关奖励了举报有功人员，少则几十元，多则一二千元。根据受奖人员的要求，一般采用不公开奖励的形式。
    检察机关还规定：对于每件举报，除匿名或化名的无法答复外，都要答复举报人。答复可以采用电话、书面或面谈等形式，由举报中心负责。对不属于检察机关管辖，而应转请有关部门处理的举报，如果是电话或当面举报的，可以当即给予答复，如是信函举报的，检察机关应在收到举报信函后７天内给予答复，并说明转办的理由，转往的部门和时间。属于检察机关管辖的举报案件，检察机关决定不立案的，要将不立案的理由通知举报人。举报人如有异议，可要求复议。检察机关对举报人的复议要求，应认真对待；对已结的举报案件，应将查处结果及时通知举报人。
