In recent years, feudal clan organizations have been increasingly active in the rural areas of Yueyang City, Hunan Province. According to investigations, nearly one-third of the villages in the city have established clan organizations. In some counties, more than 65% of the villages have elected clan leaders and family leaders. This has led to a growing phenomenon where clan power replaces administrative power and clan rules replace legal regulations.

These clan organizations issue orders to outsiders and practice self-governance among clan members, establishing their own "clan rules" to replace legal regulations. For example, some clan rules stipulate that internal disputes must be resolved by the clan leader, coercing the government to act through the clan leader, with clan members rallying support. Some rules even dictate that if theft, rape, or violence occurs within the clan, only the clan leader can be approached, not the judicial officials. Others stipulate that family inheritances are passed down to sons, not daughters. Some couples, without proper marriage registration, are recognized as married by the clan leader and proceed with a traditional wedding ceremony.

As clan power continues to expand and strengthen, issues such as honoring ancestors, raising clan banners, disparaging outsiders, and resisting the government have become more frequent. Since 1988, the city has seen over 600 clan-related disputes and fights, accounting for 58% of all rural disputes. These incidents have resulted in over 500 injuries and direct economic losses exceeding 400 million yuan. Such disputes are often large-scale, involving many people; they are difficult to mediate, with frequent incidents of defiance against the law; and they are highly destructive, often escalating into serious fights.

It is particularly noteworthy that some clan leaders have used legal democratic means to gain administrative power in villages and production teams. For example, in the second half of last year, eight villages in Linxiang County, which were piloting "village laws," had four clan leaders replace village heads during elections.

Some clan organizations, in order to protect their own interests, resist the law. Some shield criminals, obstruct law enforcement, and attack police officers; some refuse legal judgments and harass judicial organs; some even gather crowds to storm and vandalize public security agencies, demanding the release of criminals. In October of last year, the court in Meixian District of Pingjiang County held a trial for a gang of hooligans, during which over 100 family members of the defendants, led by the clan leader, stormed the detention room attempting to take the defendants away. Last year, the city saw over 30 incidents of clan resistance against the law, injuring more than 100 police officers, including three serious incidents of storming and vandalizing judicial agencies, causing a very bad social impact.

### 农村宗族势力抬头　严重冲击法制建设

　　农村宗族势力抬头　严重冲击法制建设
    近年来，湖南省岳阳市农村的封建性宗族组织不断增多。据调查，目前全市有近１／３的村成立了宗族组织，有的县群众自选族长、门长的村达到６５％以上，造成农村族权代替政权、族规代替法规的现象日益突出。
    这些宗族组织对外族长施政，发号施令；对内实行族人自治，自立“族规”，以族规代替法规。如有的族规规定：族内纠纷一律族长定处，要挟政府由族长出面，族人揭竿助威；有的还规定，族内出现盗窃、强奸、行凶等恶事，一律实行族罚，只许找族长，不许找庭长（法庭干部）；有的规定“家庭遗产传男不传女”；有的未办理结婚登记手续，经族长认婚，便成亲“拜堂”，等等。
    宗族势力不断扩大和强化，认祖宗、拉族旗、斥异族、抗政府等宗派纠纷、械斗日趋增多。１９８８年以来，全市农村共发生各类宗派纠纷、械斗６００多起，占农村纠纷总数的５８％。造成人员伤亡５００多人，直接经济损失４００万元以上。这类纠纷一般规模大，参与人数多；调处难度大，拒“法”事件多；破坏性大，恶性械斗多。
    特别值得注意的是一些宗族头人，利用合法的民主手段，取得了村、组行政领导权。如临湘县去年下半年以来，有８个“村民法”试点村，在选举中，有４个族长取代了村主任。
    一些宗族组织为了维护本族利益，对抗法律。有的包庇罪犯，有的阻挠执法，围攻殴打干警；有的不服法律裁决，骚扰司法机关；有的甚至聚众冲砸公安机关，索抢罪犯。去年１０月，平江县法院在梅仙区就地宣判一流氓团伙案，被告人家族１００多人，在族长带领下，闯进关押室，企图将被告带走。去年市农村共发生以族抗法事件３０多起，打伤干警百余人，其中冲砸司法机关的恶性事件３起，给社会造成极坏影响。
