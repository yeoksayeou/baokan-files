On April 7, three Chinese young players, Ma Wen Ge, Yu Shen Tong, and Xie Chao Jie, who participated in the World Table Tennis Championships for the first time, successively defeated strong opponents and advanced to the men's singles top 16. Each round they played was not easy. Several matches of the three young players were turned around from a losing position to a winning one.

Compared to their opponents, these three young players from the Chinese team did not have an advantage in terms of technique and playing style. The situation in the matches was also unfavorable, so what did they rely on to win? Firstly, it was courage and fighting spirit. After the match, Yu Shen Tong told us, "During the team competition, I was always afraid of losing and felt that I was not good enough as soon as I stepped onto the court. In the singles match, once I opened my mind, things got much better. Even when the score was 20-20, I didn't feel like I was going to lose." Winning a match, of course, requires technical strength and correct tactics as a guarantee, but courage and confidence are also indispensable. The battles of the three young players show that in close matches where the levels are similar, morale and tenacious will often play a decisive role.

Secondly, to win a match, one must fully utilize their strengths and not always focus on their weaknesses. If Xie Chao Jie kept thinking that his positive rubber was not good at handling chopping, he would surely lack the confidence to defeat his opponent. After watching the matches over the past few days, Secretary-General Cheng Jia Yan of the Chinese Table Tennis Association said a sentence worth pondering. He said, "Recently, we have been talking too much about how our playing style is lagging behind, to the point where we have lost confidence in ourselves."

In today's world of table tennis, techniques are constantly developing, and there is no perfect playing style. Similarly, every athlete has their strengths and weaknesses. Through mutual competition and confrontation, each side is further developing their strengths, making their characteristics more prominent, while at the same time compensating for their weaknesses, making their shortcomings less obvious. Whichever playing style or athlete does this better will take the lead. In the history of world table tennis, there has never been a playing style that has disappeared, nor has there been a playing style that has been dominant for over 60 years.

### 靠什么闯入前１６名——小将闯关的启迪

　　靠什么闯入前１６名
    ——小将闯关的启迪
    ４月７日，第一次参加世乒赛的中国小将马文革、于沈潼、谢超杰先后力克劲敌，打入男子单打前１６名，他们每打一轮都不容易。三员小将的好几盘比赛都是在落后情况下，反败为胜的。
    同对手相比，中国队这三员小将技术和打法上并不占优势，比赛中局面又很不利，他们取胜靠的是什么呢？首先是靠勇气和拚劲。于沈潼下场后对我们说：“团体赛时一上场总怕输，也总觉得自己不行。单打时思想一放开，就好多了，比分落后到２０，我都没觉得会输。”打比赛，取胜当然要靠技术实力和正确战术作保证，但勇气和信心也是不可少的。三名小将的战例说明，在水平相差不大的激战中，士气和顽强的意志往往起着决定性的作用。
    其次，在比赛中要战胜对方，必须充分发挥自己特长，不能老想着自己短处。谢超杰如果老想着正胶不好打削球，肯定就没信心去打败对手了。中国乒协秘书长程嘉炎看了这几天比赛后，讲了一句值得令人深思的话。他说：“这一段我们讲自己打法落后太多，搞得自己都没信心了。”
    当今世界乒坛，技术在不断发展，没有一种打法是十全十美的，同样，每个运动员都有自己的长处和短处。通过相互竞争较量，各自都在进一步发展特长，使自己的特点更突出，与此同时弥补短处，使弱点不那么突出。哪种打法，哪个运动员这方面做得好些，就能取得领先地位。世界乒乓球运动有史以来，还没有哪一种打法消亡，也没有哪种打法６０多年来始终占上风。
