Our city decided to rebuild the Children's Palace in 1982. To raise funds, the municipal government mobilized several large enterprises stationed in Luzhou to sponsor the project, residential committees encouraged every household to donate, and the municipal government also allocated part of the funds. In 1983, the new Children's Palace was completed, and parents and children were overjoyed.

However, the good times did not last long. The relevant authorities first leased the palace to set up an exhibition hall, an adult cultural guidance station, and primary school classrooms. By the end of last year, the municipal committee in charge of the Children's Palace collaborated with Luzhou Distilled Liquor Factory. The factory invested tens of millions of yuan to renovate the 200-plus-square-meter activity room on the ground floor of the palace into a luxurious dance hall, which was then leased to laid-off workers for operation. Although both the lessee and the lessor made money, the children lost their activity space.

　　儿童文化宫成了跳舞厅
    我市１９８２年决定重建少年儿童文化宫。为了筹措资金，市政府动员驻泸州市的一些大型企业赞助，居委会动员各家各户捐资，市政府也拨了部分资金。１９８３年新的少年儿童文化宫落成，家长、孩子为此而欢欣。
    然而好景不长，有关人员先是将这座文化宫出租办展厅、作成人文化辅导站和小学教室。去年年底，市少年儿童文化宫的主管单位市团委又与泸州曲酒厂合作，由泸州曲酒厂投资数１０万元，将文化宫底楼２００多平方米的活动室装修为豪华舞厅，然后租赁给停薪留职者经营。虽然租赁双方赚钱了，而少年儿童却失去了活动场所。
