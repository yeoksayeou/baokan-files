Mauritania Implements Curfew in Two Cities
	Xinhua News Agency, Nouakchott, April 25

The Chairman of the National Salvation Military Committee and Head of State of Mauritania, Taya, issued a curfew order today.

The order stipulates that from 8 PM to 6 AM the next morning, a curfew will be enforced in the capital Nouakchott and the city of Nouadhibou.

In recent days, clashes have occurred between local residents and Senegalese expatriates in Nouakchott, resulting in some casualties. This is an emergency measure taken by the authorities to stabilize social order and prevent the situation from escalating.

Since the border conflict between the two countries at the beginning of this month, relations have become increasingly tense. Recently, there have been incidents of assaults on expatriates from the other country within each country's borders.
