Title: Why Not Change Tune After a Failed Venture?

The new U.S. administration's foreign policy has not yet been fully unveiled, but recently, President Bush has reached an agreement with leaders of both parties in Congress on Central American issues, expressing support for the peace and democratization process in Central America. This agreement indicates a clear shift in U.S. policy towards Central America, from relying heavily on military means to using more diplomatic efforts to seek political solutions to Central American problems. The Washington Post commented that Bush's diplomatic stance on Central American issues "stands in sharp contrast to the Reagan era."

Bush's Central American policy differs from that of the Reagan administration, according to Secretary of State Baker, because the Reagan era's Central American policy was "basically a failure." Baker attributes this failure to what he calls "U.S. disunity," meaning that the executive branch was moving in one direction while the legislative branch was moving in another, referring to the fact that many congressional members have long opposed Reagan's provision of military aid to the anti-government forces in Nicaragua, ultimately vetoing the military aid plan last year.

Baker's complaint seems to have some superficial validity, but it is far from the truth. Because it has long been pointed out that the Reagan administration's attempt to support anti-government forces in another country to overthrow a legitimate government by force is fundamentally in violation of international law standards and is bound to be condemned by public opinion in various countries, it is doomed to fail. Today, the U.S. Secretary of State himself publicly admits defeat, which is undoubtedly a wise recognition of reality.

The U.S. legislative branch's opposition to the White House's decisions is precisely because it saw that this policy would not succeed and was not in the interest of the American people. Former Speaker of the House of Representatives O'Neill said at the time of vetoing Reagan's military aid proposal: "We can no longer send our children to Central America like we did in the Vietnam War." The two houses of Congress and both parties' investigation into the "Iran-Contra affair" was also due to the fear that the U.S. government would secretly bypass Congress to provide military support to the anti-government forces in Nicaragua. The Reagan administration's Central American policy was so unpopular both domestically and internationally, how could it not fail?

Since it is acknowledged that this policy is a failure, the White House should change its tune. The Bush administration's proposal to solve problems through diplomatic means is, after all, a positive step. But Secretary of State Baker also said that if the Nicaraguan government does not fulfill its democratic commitments, such as holding early elections, the United States will work to keep the anti-government forces "intact" and maintain the "freedom of choice" to provide them with military aid. It seems that the White House is still not completely willing to abandon its predecessor's interventionism in Central American affairs, still wanting to leave a tail to implement the so-called "carrot and stick" policy. This is really a useless threat. Even U.S. officials privately admit that the White House's "threats have little deterrent force behind them"; "military aid is a matter of name only." The anti-government forces in Nicaragua scattered throughout Honduras have been disbanded according to the agreement of the five Central American heads of state and are now just scattered soldiers, a lost cause.

The crux of the Central American problem is that the United States insists on interfering in the internal affairs of Central America. If the major power abandons any form of interference and allows the local countries to solve their own problems, this will be the true way out for the Central American problem, and the new U.S. government can also get rid of the "biggest problem in U.S. foreign policy" in this way. What does the White House think?

　　既为“败举”何不改弦更张
    景宪法
    美国新政府的外交政策尚未全部出台，可最近布什总统已就中美洲问题同国会两党领袖达成协议，表示支持中美洲和平与民主化的进程。该协议表明美国的中美洲政策发生了明显变化，即从过去倚重军事手段转向更多地运用外交手段，寻找中美洲问题的政治解决。《华盛顿邮报》发表评论说，布什在中美洲问题上的外交姿态“与里根时代形成鲜明对照”。
    布什的中美洲政策之所以不同于里根政府，按国务卿贝克的说法是：里根时代的中美洲政策“基本上是败举”。贝克把这种失败的原因归咎于所谓美国的“不团结”，即“行政部门走的是一个方向，而立法机构走的是另一个方向”，意指国会众多议员一直反对里根向尼加拉瓜反政府武装力量提供军事援助，乃至去年最终否决军援计划。
    贝克的这种抱怨从表面看来，也许有一点道理，但决非事情的实质。因为，人们早就一再指出，里根政府那种企图支持别国反政府武装以武力颠覆一个合法政府的做法是根本违反国际法准则，必然受到各国公众舆论的谴责，是注定要失败的。今天美国国务卿自己也公开承认失败了，这无疑是认清现实的明智之举。
    美国立法机构之所以对白宫的决策投反对票，也正是看到了这一政策不会成功的，不符合美国国民的利益。前国会众议院议长奥尼尔当年在否决里根军援提案时说：“我们再也不能像打越南战争那样把我们的孩子送到中美洲去。”国会两院两党对“伊朗门事件”进行追究，其中一个原因，也就是害怕美国政府从暗中绕过国会以军事支援尼加拉瓜的反政府武装力量。里根政府的中美洲政策如此内外不得人心，焉有不失败之理。
    既然承认这种政策是败举，白宫理应改弦更张。布什政府提出以外交途径解决问题，应该说有其积极的一面。但国务卿贝克又说，如果尼加拉瓜政府不履行提前大选等民主承诺，美国就要设法使反政府武装“保持完整无损”，并保持对其进行军事援助的“选择自由”。看来，白宫在中美洲事务中显然还不肯完全放弃其前任的干涉主义，总还想留那么个尾巴，以实行所谓“胡萝卜加大棒”的政策。这实在是一种毫无用处的吓唬。就连美国官员也在私下承认：白宫“恐吓的背后没有多大威慑力”；“军事援助是个名存实亡的问题。”散落在洪都拉斯各处的尼加拉瓜反政府武装力量已经中美洲五国首脑协议将其遣散，现在也是散兵游勇而已，扶不起的阿斗。
    中美洲问题的症结，是美国执意干涉中美洲内部的事务。大国放弃任何形式的干涉，让当地国家自己解决自已的问题，这才是中美洲问题的真正出路，这样，美国新政府也能就此摆脱“美国对外政策中的最大难题”。不知白宫以为如何？
