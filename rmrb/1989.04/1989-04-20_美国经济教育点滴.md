	The United States Economic Education Association recently conducted a survey on the economic knowledge of middle school students to promote economic education. The survey found that three out of four students could not correctly answer the question: "Profit equals: A. Sales revenue minus taxes and depreciation; B. Sales revenue minus wages and salaries; C. Assets minus liabilities; D. Revenue minus cost." Only one-third of the students chose the correct answer (D), and the rest were labeled "economically illiterate."

	The survey also revealed that 75% of the students could not explain the consequences of inflation (price increases), 55% did not know what constitutes a government budget deficit (government spending exceeding tax revenue), and 61% did not understand the meaning of Gross National Product. The survey further found that if the social studies courses taken by students did not include economics, nearly two-thirds of the test questions were answered incorrectly. Students who had taken a basic economics course still only answered half of the questions correctly.

	The report concluded that the main reasons for these issues are that most middle schools do not prioritize economic education. Out of the 50 states in the country, only 15 require students to study economics for one semester to graduate. Additionally, the lack of well-trained teachers also contributes to students' lack of economic knowledge.

　　美国经济教育点滴
    利润等于：Ａ．销售额减去税收和折旧
    　　　　　Ｂ．销售额减掉工资和薪水
    　　　　　Ｃ．资产减负债
    　　　　　Ｄ．收益减成本
    这是不久前，美国八千名中学生被考问的试题之一，其中三分之二的人没有选出正确的答案（Ｄ），而被划入“经济文盲”之列。
    美国经济教育联合会在为促进经济教育而做的中学生经济知识调查中还发现百分之七十五的学生说不出通货膨胀的后果（物价上涨），百分之五十五的人不知道是什么构成政府的预算赤字（政府支出超过税收），百分之六十一的人不懂得国民生产总值的含义。调查还发现，中学生所修的社会课程如不包括经济学，考生答错的题目近三分之二。上过一门基本经济学的学生，也只答对了一半的试题。
    调查报告认为，产生上述情况的原因，首先是大部分中学不重视经济教育。全国五十个州里，只有十五个州规定，中学生要学习一个学期的经济学才予以毕业。其次，缺少训练有素的教师，也造成学生对经济的无知的原因。
