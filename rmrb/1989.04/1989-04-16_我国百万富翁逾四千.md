China's private enterprises are developing rapidly, with over 400,000 currently in operation. Both the scale of employment and the asset scale of these enterprises are increasing in tandem. By the end of 1987, the number of private enterprises with assets exceeding 10 million yuan had reached 4,000.

Experts point out that the rapid enrichment of private enterprise owners can be attributed to three factors: business acumen, surplus labor of employees, and loopholes in national policies. Currently, many private enterprises maintain and expand production through methods such as "bribing for raw materials and using kickbacks for sales," which has drawn serious attention from relevant authorities.

　　我国百万富翁逾四千
    中国私人企业迅速发展，目前已逾４０万家。其雇工规模和资产规模也在同步增加。至１９８７年底，资产超过百万元以上的私人企业数已达４０００个。
    有关专家指出，私人企业主较快致富的原因有三：经营才干，雇工的剩余劳动，以及国家的政策漏洞。目前，许多私人企业用“一靠行贿进原料，二靠回扣搞推销”的方式维持和扩大生产，已引起有关部门的严重关注。
