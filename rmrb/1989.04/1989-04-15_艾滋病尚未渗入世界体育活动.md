	Recently, at a conference held in Geneva by the World Health Organization and the World Sports Medicine Association, experts unanimously confirmed that no cases of AIDS infection due to participation in international sports activities have been found so far. Medical experts believe that the main risk of contracting AIDS through sports activities is when a healthy athlete's skin abrasion or mucous membrane comes into contact with the wound of an infected athlete, especially in contact sports like wrestling and rugby. Therefore, injured athletes should be treated to stop bleeding before continuing the competition.

　　艾滋病尚未渗入世界体育活动
    最近在日内瓦举行的世界卫生组织和世界运动医学协会研讨会上，专家们一致确认目前尚未发现由于共同参加国际体育活动而被感染艾滋病的病例。医学家认为，健康运动员皮肤擦伤或皮肤粘膜同得病运动员的伤口接触，是体育活动中传染艾滋病的主要危险，尤其是像摔跤和橄榄球这类身体接触的项目。为此，应让受伤运动员止血后再继续比赛。
