The foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq held their second direct meeting today in Geneva as part of the latest round of peace talks, but no progress was made.

After the talks concluded, both foreign ministers spoke to reporters, reaffirming their respective positions on key issues and blaming the other side for the failure of the negotiations.

Iran insists on implementing the four-point peace plan proposed by UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar point by point. It first demands that Iraq withdraw its troops to the internationally recognized border. Iraq, on the other hand, insists on discussing the peace plan as a whole and demands that Iran ensure free navigation in the Persian Gulf.

UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar chaired the meeting between the two foreign ministers.

After the meeting, he told reporters that it is normal for the two foreign ministers to reaffirm their positions, and it will take time for them to understand each other's positions. He hopes that the two foreign ministers will realize that "compromise is necessary."

The latest round of peace talks between the two foreign ministers began on April 20 and is scheduled to end on April 24. They have agreed to meet again tomorrow.

　　两伊外长会谈陷入僵局  德奎利亚尔望双方妥协
    新华社日内瓦４月２２日电  伊朗外长韦拉亚提和伊拉克外长阿齐兹今天在这里举行了最近一轮和平谈判的第二次直接会晤，但未取得任何进展。
    两伊外长在会谈结束后分别对记者发表谈话，重申了各自在一些主要问题上的立场，并指责对方使谈判失败。
    伊朗主张，要逐点实行联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔提出的解决两伊冲突的４点和平计划，它首先要求伊拉克将其部队撤回到国际承认的边界线之内。而伊拉克则针锋相对，要求双方把这一和平计划作为一个整体来讨论，并坚持要求伊朗实现海湾的自由通航。
    联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔主持了两伊外长的这次会晤。
    他在会晤结束后对记者说，两伊外长重申各自的立场是正常的，要使他们相互理解对方的立场还需要时间。他希望两伊外长能够意识到，“妥协是需要的”。
    两伊外长的最近一轮和平谈判是本月２０日开始的，定于２４日结束。他们已同意于明天再次会晤。
