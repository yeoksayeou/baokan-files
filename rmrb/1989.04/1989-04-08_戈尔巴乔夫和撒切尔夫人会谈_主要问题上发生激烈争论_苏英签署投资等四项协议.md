	Gorbachev and Thatcher Hold Talks
	Heated Debates on Major Issues
	Soviet-British Sign Four Agreements on Investment

	New York Times, London, April 6 - Soviet leader Gorbachev and British Prime Minister Thatcher held a four-hour "frank" meeting today. Although the two sides failed to resolve differences on major issues, including arms control, they both expressed satisfaction with the talks.

	The two leaders held a brief press conference after the meeting. Thatcher said that the meeting, which lasted an hour and a half longer than originally scheduled, was "very profound, extensive, and the atmosphere was very good." Gorbachev described the meeting as "high-level and substantial."

	British officials said that some progress was made on issues such as achieving peace in the Middle East and implementing United Nations resolutions on Namibia. However, according to informed sources, heated debates occurred on some major issues.

	Thatcher accused the Soviet Union of concealing the actual number of its chemical weapons. She pointed out that the Soviet Union possesses 300,000 tons of chemical weapons, not the 50,000 tons that the Soviet Union itself admits to. Gorbachev denied the accusation but said that further talks could be held on the matter. On the issue of European short-range missiles, Gorbachev criticized Britain's position, but Thatcher said she would continue to support NATO's short-range missile modernization plan. She said Britain firmly opposes the Soviet proposal for a "nuclear-free Europe." The Prime Minister also expressed concern over reports that the Soviet Union had sold advanced bombers to Libya.

	During the meeting, Gorbachev briefed Thatcher on the situation of Soviet reforms. Thatcher praised the Soviet reforms as "a peaceful revolution."

	Despite many differences, the British leader believes that current British-Soviet relations are "better than at any time since the Second World War."

	People's Daily, London, April 6 - Our reporter Chen Te'an reports: Today, the two countries signed a new memorandum aimed at increasing trade between the two countries. British Minister of Trade and Industry Young and Soviet Deputy Prime Minister Kamensky signed the agreement on behalf of their respective governments at Lancaster House.

	At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze signed three agreements on investment, new visa rules, and gifts to Armenian schools on behalf of their respective governments at 10 Downing Street. Chairman Gorbachev and Prime Minister Thatcher attended the signing ceremony.
