	The Life of Comrade Hu Juewen
	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 26th

	Comrade Hu Juewen, a loyal patriot, renowned political activist, outstanding industrialist, founder and outstanding leader of the China Democratic National Construction Association, close friend of the Communist Party of China, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Sixth National People's Congress, Honorary Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, and Chairman of the Chinese Vocational Education Society, passed away in Beijing on April 16, 1989, due to illness. He was 94 years old.

	Comrade Hu Juewen was born on October 7, 1895, in Jiading County, Jiangsu Province (now part of Shanghai). During his youth, influenced by patriotic and democratic ideas, he was deeply concerned about the country's weakness and poverty, and the frequent foreign invasions. He resolved to dedicate his life to industrial development to revitalize the nation. For this reason, in 1914, he enrolled in the Beijing Higher Industrial School to study mechanical engineering. After graduating, he volunteered to work at the Hanyang Iron Works and later served as the head of the practical workshop at the Tongji Medical and Engineering School in Shanghai. In 1921, he sold his ancestral land and, with the help of friends, established the Xinmin Machinery Factory. Subsequently, he founded several other enterprises, including the Cooperation Hardware Factory, Huangdu Electric Light Company, Changcheng Machine-Made Brick and Tile Company, and Shicheng Kiln Factory, serving as the manager or general manager of these companies. He worked diligently, researched and imitated new machinery, and produced many products with lower costs than imported goods but comparable quality, contributing significantly to the development of national industries. In 1927, he was elected as the chairman of the Shanghai Machinery Industry Association and served for ten consecutive years. To resist Japanese goods, he organized the China Machinery United Company and served as the chairman of the Shanghai Cotton Market.

	On January 28, 1932, Japanese imperialist forces invaded Shanghai. General Cai Tingyi led the 19th Route Army to resist the enemy. Comrade Hu Juewen, together with Huang Yanpei, organized the Shanghai business community to support the war effort through the Chinese Vocational Education Society and other organizations. He worked tirelessly, mobilizing and organizing the business community to relocate machinery to the southern part of Shanghai to establish factories, and dispatching skilled workers to support the munitions factories. In a short period, he grew a beard to demonstrate his firm resolve to resist imperialism and save the nation, showing his lofty national spirit and loyal patriotism.

	On August 13, 1937, Japanese invaders landed in Jinshan, Shanghai. To preserve national industries and support the war effort, Comrade Hu Juewen, with great patriotic enthusiasm, organized over a hundred private enterprises in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, and Nanjing to relocate inland. During this period, he established the Dazhong Machinery Factory and Xinmin Machinery Factory in Guilin and Qiyang, respectively. He served as the chairman of the Central South Industrial Association and the chairman of the renowned Chuanjiang Factory United Association. These organizations played important roles in the production of military and civilian supplies, uniting industrialists and businessmen to raise patriotic awareness, and engaging in anti-Japanese democratic movements in the rear areas.

	After the victory in 1945, American goods flooded the domestic market. The Kuomintang government, however, canceled all contracts between the government and private enterprises, pushing national industries to the brink of collapse. The harsh social reality made Comrade Hu Juewen and other progressive business leaders realize that merely running businesses could not save the nation. Industrialists needed their own political organizations. During this time, they met with Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, Wang Ruofei, Deng Yingchao, and Mao Zedong, among other Communist Party leaders. After several discussions, he and Huang Yanpei, Zhang Naiji, and others initiated the founding of the China Democratic National Construction Association, uniting patriotic industrialists and businessmen, as well as intellectuals, to actively participate in the democratic revolution. He opposed the civil war, advocated for peace, opposed dictatorship, and advocated for democracy. In 1946, he was elected as a member of the delegation to Nanjing to petition for the cessation of the civil war and the realization of peace. Despite the extremely adverse political environment, he persisted in leading the activities of the China Democratic National Construction Association, fearlessly facing dangers. In 1948, due to the persecution by the Kuomintang reactionaries, the China Democratic National Construction Association was forced to go underground. Comrade Hu Juewen established the "China Industrial Monthly Magazine" in Shanghai to cover the continued activities of the China Democratic National Construction Association. Before the liberation of Shanghai, other key leaders of the China Democratic National Construction Association went to Hong Kong and the liberated areas to work. Comrade Hu Juewen, on behalf of the organization, remained in Shanghai to lead the underground work of the China Democratic National Construction Association. In the difficult old China, Comrade Hu Juewen persisted in his anti-imperialist, patriotic, and democratic stance, fighting tirelessly for the development of national industries and making significant contributions to national liberation and the new democratic revolution. In September 1949, Comrade Hu Juewen, as a representative of the China Democratic National Construction Association, attended the first plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, contributing to the founding of the People's Republic of China.

	After the founding of New China, Comrade Hu Juewen was overjoyed by the rebirth of the country and sincerely believed in the truth that without the Communist Party, there would be no New China. He was determined to support the leadership of the Communist Party of China and dedicate himself to the construction of New China. During the three-year recovery period, he actively promoted the Shanghai business community to work hard to restore production and develop the economy, leading the way in purchasing Victory Real Bonds. During the Korean War, he donated all his savings to the country for the war effort and supported his son to join the army and go to Korea. In 1952, he served as the deputy leader of the delegation to Korea to visit the front lines and personally comfort our most beloved soldiers. During the transitional period of the state, he actively promoted and implemented the policies of the Communist Party of China and the people's government, taking the lead in implementing public-private partnerships in his own enterprises, and encouraging business community members to actively cooperate with the state's socialist transformation. In the following years, he set an example and, together with fellow members of the China Democratic National Construction Association, did a great deal of work in uniting and educating the business community, making outstanding contributions to the construction of socialism. In 1957, Comrade Hu Juewen led a delegation from the China Democratic National Construction Association to attend the National Congress of the Liberal Democratic Party of the German Democratic Republic, making significant contributions to enhancing the friendship between the peoples and organizations of China and Germany. During the ten years of turmoil, despite being persecuted by the Gang of Four, he firmly believed in the victory of the Communist Party of China and the people, demonstrating the noble character of a patriotic democrat.

	In the new era, although Comrade Hu Juewen was advanced in age, his resolve to serve the modernization of socialism in China remained unwavering. He firmly supported the line, principles, and policies of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, actively participated in the decision-making and management of state affairs, and led fellow members of the China Democratic National Construction Association to work closely with the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, adhering to the principle of "firmly following the Party and dedicating oneself to the Four Modernizations," making active contributions to the Four Modernizations and the reform and opening-up. He often said that this was a golden age for the business community to serve socialist construction, and one should put in all their effort. He himself did just that. He frequently conducted investigations and research in various places, providing many valuable suggestions on the management and maintenance of machinery and equipment, urban industry, and vocational education in China, which were highly regarded by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council and adopted by relevant departments. His actions greatly inspired and set an example for fellow business community members, earning the praise and admiration of the broad masses of the people and people from all walks of life.

	Since the founding of the nation, Comrade Hu Juewen has been elected to serve as the vice chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, vice mayor; representative of the First National People's Congress, member of the Standing Committee of the Second and Third National People's Congress, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth National People's Congress; member of the First, Second, Third, and Fourth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and member of the Standing Committee of the Fifth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

	Comrade Hu Juewen is one of the founders and outstanding leaders of the China Democratic National Construction Association, making significant contributions to its establishment and development. At the beginning of the China Democratic National Construction Association, he served as a standing committee member. In the first and second national congresses of the China Democratic National Construction Association, he was elected as the vice chairman of the Central Committee. Since 1979, he has served as the chairman of the Third Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the chairman of the Fourth Central Committee, leading the China Democratic National Construction Association to shift its work focus and creating the best period in the history of the China Democratic National Construction Association. At the end of 1987, he voluntarily resigned from the chairmanship to further promote the new-old exchange of the central leadership of the China Democratic National Construction Association, actively recommending new people, and having a significant political impact both inside and outside the China Democratic National Construction Association. He was consecutively elected as the honorary chairman by the Fourth and Fifth Central Committees of the China Democratic National Construction Association. Since 1965, Comrade Hu Juewen has successively served as the acting chairman and chairman of the Chinese Vocational Education Society, making new contributions to the development of vocational education in China. He also served as a standing committee member of the First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth National Committees of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce.

	Comrade Hu Juewen's life was dedicated to the nation, the people, and the cause of patriotism. He "firmly followed the Party and dedicated himself to the Four Modernizations," making outstanding contributions and setting an example. In his final moments, he still cared about the country's reform, opening-up, and the great cause of national reunification, instructing fellow members of the China Democratic National Construction Association, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and the Chinese Vocational Education Society to seriously study and implement the basic line of the primary stage of socialism proposed by the Thirteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, fully utilizing their own characteristics and roles, actively contributing to the tasks of rectification and deepening reform proposed by the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and to the development of political, economic, and cultural affairs. Respected Comrade Hu Juewen has left us forever. We mourn him by learning from his pursuit of truth, belief in truth, and unyielding revolutionary spirit, striving to build our country into a prosperous, democratic, civilized, and modern socialist nation.

　　胡厥文同志生平
    新华社北京４月２６日电  忠诚的爱国主义者、著名的政治活动家、杰出的实业家、中国民主建国会创建人和卓越的领导人、中国共产党的亲密朋友，第六届全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长、中国民主建国会中央委员会名誉主席、中华职业教育社理事长胡厥文同志，因病医治无效，于１９８９年４月１６日在北京逝世，享年９４岁。
    胡厥文同志１８９５年１０月７日生于江苏省嘉定县（现属上海市）。青少年时期，他受爱国主义和民主主义思想的影响，痛心于国弱民贫，外侮日亟，立志一生办工业以振兴民族。为此，他在１９１４年报考了北京高等工业专门学校学习机械。毕业后，志愿到汉阳铁工厂当工人，后任上海同济医工专门学校实习工场主任。１９２１年他变卖了祖传的土地，在亲友资助下创办了新民机器厂。以后，又陆续创办合作五金厂、黄渡电灯公司、长城机制砖瓦公司、石城窑厂等企业，任厂长、总经理职务。他勤奋从业，悉心研究和仿制新的机器，不少产品成本比外国货低，而质量可与舶来品媲美，为促进民族工业发展作出了贡献。１９２７年，他被同业推为上海机器业同业公会主任委员，并连选连任达十年之久。为抵制日货，组织中华机器联合公司，并担任上海市棉布市场理事长职务。
    １９３２年１月２８日，日本帝国主义的军队进犯上海，蔡廷锴将军率十九路军奋起抗敌，胡厥文同志与黄炎培合作，通过中华职教社等组织，发动全市工商界支援抗战。他日夜奔走，联络、组织工商界拆迁机器到沪南建立工场，抽调技术工人支援兵工厂，为我守军赶制武器弹药。几十天时间里，须髯盈颊，遂蓄髯以示反帝救国的坚定意志，表现了崇高的民族气节和忠贞的爱国主义精神。
    １９３７年８月１３日，日本侵略军在上海金山登陆。为了保存民族工业，支援抗战，胡厥文同志又以高度的爱国热忱呼号奔走，组织江浙沪宁的百余家民营工厂内迁。在此期间，他在桂林、祁阳等地创办了大中机器厂、新民机器厂湘厂等企业。他分别担任了中南区工业协会理事长、知名的迁川工厂联合会常务理事、理事长。这两个组织在抗日的大后方，在军需民用的生产、团结民族工商业家提高爱国主义觉悟、从事抗日民主运动等方面，均发挥了重要作用。
    １９４５年抗战胜利后，美国货充斥国内市场。而国民党政府却下令取消政府同民营工厂的一切合同，使民族工业陷于绝境。严酷的社会现实使胡厥文同志和其他进步工商界人士认识到，单单办实业是不能救国的，民族工业家必须有自己的政治团体。就在这些日子里，他们在重庆先后接触到周恩来、董必武、王若飞、邓颖超和毛泽东等中共领导同志。经过多次酝酿，他与黄炎培、章乃器等人发起成立了民主建国会，团结爱国民族工商业家及有联系的知识界人士，积极投身到民主革命的火热斗争中。他反对内战，坚持和平，反对独裁，坚持民主。１９４６年他被推举为上海各界人民团体组织的赴南京请愿停止内战、实现和平的代表团成员。在当时异常恶劣的政治环境里，他坚持参与领导民建活动，不避艰险。１９４８年由于国民党反动派的迫害，民建被迫转入地下。胡厥文同志在上海创办“中国工业月刊社”，掩护民建继续活动。上海解放前夕，民建其他几位主要负责人分别到香港和解放区工作，胡厥文同志受组织委托，坚持在上海领导民建的地下工作。在苦难深重的旧中国，胡厥文同志坚持反帝爱国、民主立场，为民族工业的发展进行了不懈的斗争，为民族解放和新民主主义革命事业作出了重要贡献。１９４９年９月，胡厥文同志以民主建国会代表的身份出席制订《共同纲领》和选举产生新中国中央人民政府的中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议，为中华人民共和国的诞生立下了功绩。
    新中国成立后，胡厥文同志为多灾多难的祖国得到新生感到兴奋不已，由衷地信服没有共产党就没有新中国的真理，矢志拥护中国共产党的领导，献身于新中国的建设事业。三年恢复时期，他积极推动上海工商界为恢复生产发展经济努力工作，带头认购胜利折实公债。抗美援朝时期，他将自己的积蓄尽数捐献国家作抗敌之用，并支持自己的儿子参军入朝。１９５２年他担任赴朝慰问团总团副团长，亲自到战火纷飞的前线看望我们最可爱的人民子弟兵。在国家的过渡时期，他以极大的积极性宣传、推行中国共产党和人民政府的方针政策，率先在自己的企业实行公私合营，带动工商界同仁积极配合国家的社会主义改造事业。在尔后的岁月里，他又以身作则，和民建同志一道在工商界中做了大量的团结、教育工作，为国家的社会主义建设作出了受人称道的成绩。１９５７年，胡厥文同志率中国民主建国会代表团，应邀参加了德意志民主共和国自由民主党全国代表大会，为增进中德两国人民和两个组织的友谊做了很有意义的工作。在十年动乱中，尽管受到林彪、“四人帮”一伙的迫害，但他坚信中国共产党和人民一定会胜利，表现了一位爱国民主人士的高尚情操。
    进入新时期以来，胡厥文同志已届高龄，但为国家社会主义现代化建设服务的志向弥坚。他坚决拥护中共十一届三中全会路线、方针、政策，积极参与国家事务的决策和管理，并领导中国民主建国会的同志与中华全国工商业联合会密切协作，以“坚定不移跟党走，尽心竭力为四化”为行动纲领，为四化建设和改革开放献计献策，作出了积极贡献。他常说，现在是工商界为社会主义建设服务千载难逢的黄金时代，要把吃奶的力气拿出来。他自己就是这样做的。他多次到地方进行调查研究，就我国的机械设备管理维修、城市工业和职业教育工作提出过许多宝贵意见，受到中共中央和国务院的重视，被有关部门采纳。他的言行，对工商界同志起了很大的鼓舞和示范作用，博得了广大人民群众和各界爱国人士的赞扬。
    建国以来，胡厥文同志先后被选举担任上海市政协副主席，副市长；第一届全国人大代表，第二、三届全国人大常委会委员，第四、五、六届全国人大常委会副委员长；第一、二、三、四届全国政协委员，第五届全国政协常务委员。
    胡厥文同志是中国民主建国会的创建人和卓越的领导人之一，为民建的创建和发展作出了重要贡献。民建创建之初，他任常务理事，在民建第一、二次全国代表大会上都被选为中央委员会副主任委员，１９７９年以来，他担任民建第三届中央委员会主任委员和第四届中央委员会主席，领导民建实现工作重点转移，开创了民建历史上最好时期。１９８７年底，他为进一步推进民建中央领导班子的新老交替，坚决辞去主席职务，并积极推荐新人，在民建内外产生了令人瞩目的政治影响。他连续被民建第四届、第五届中央委员会推举为名誉主席。１９６５年以后，胡厥文同志先后担任中华职业教育社的代理事长、理事长，为发展我国的职业教育事业作出了新的贡献。他还担任中华全国工商业联合会第一、二、三、四、五届的常务委员。
    胡厥文同志一生热爱祖国、追求进步。他热爱祖国、热爱民族之心不仅从未改变和动摇，而且在新旧中国鲜明对比和中国共产党的启发影响下，逐渐地由爱国主义向社会主义的思想境界发展，深刻领悟到只有社会主义能够救中国。他一直强调，如果没有共产党的领导，社会主义的胜利实现是不可能的。在四十多年的岁月里，他始终坚定不移地站在中国共产党的一边，与中国共产党长期合作，患难与共，并肩战斗，是共产党信赖的战友和诤友之一。在１９８２年和１９８３年，他分别对中国共产党的统战工作和整党工作，提出过批评和建议，受到中共中央的高度评价。１９８６年，针对“一国两制”方针的实施和爱国统一战线出现的新格局，他与胡子昂同志联名提出了“关于中国共产党对统一战线的领导的意见”。几十年来，他认真学习马列主义、毛泽东思想，努力进行自我教育，不遗余力地为建设新中国而努力工作。即在近几年患病期间，他还是念念不忘要为祖国的社会主义现代化建设奉献力量。他为爱国统一战线的巩固和扩大，为坚持和完善中国共产党领导的多党合作制度和政治协商制度，作出了卓越的贡献，受到了中国民主建国会、中华职业教育社广大成员和所联系群众的尊敬和爱戴。
    胡厥文同志光明磊落、作风正派，是非爱憎泾渭分明，处事注重大事大节。他待人宽、对己严，善于团结同志。他有知人之明，又有用人之量，对同志披肝沥胆、关怀备至，自己从不患得患失。同他接触过的人，都为他的正直、坦诚所感动。他又是书法家和诗人，他的书法高古、洒脱，他的诗词豪放、热情，也是他正直、豪爽性格的体现。他的道德风范永远值得我们学习。
    胡厥文同志的一生是为民族、为祖国、为人民不倦奋斗的一生。他“坚定不移跟党走，尽心竭力为四化”，卓著勋劳，堪称典范。在他病危之际仍关心着国家的改革、开放和祖国统一大业，嘱咐民建、工商联和职教社的同志们，要认真学习和贯彻执行中共十三大提出的社会主义初级阶段的基本路线，充分发挥各自的特点和作用，为实现中共十三届三中全会提出的治理整顿和深化改革的任务，为政治、经济、文教事业的发展积极贡献力量。敬爱的胡厥老和我们永别了，我们悼念他，就是要学习他追求真理、笃信真理的高尚品质和生命不息、奋斗不止的革命精神，为把我国建设成为富强、民主、文明的现代化社会主义国家而努力奋斗。
