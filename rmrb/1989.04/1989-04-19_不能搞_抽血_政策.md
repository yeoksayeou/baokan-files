	Do Not Implement a "Bloodletting" Policy
	Li Daqiang, Director of Shenyang Railway Bureau
	Hu Guoming, Former Chief Accountant

	During the initial stages of economic development in various industrialized nations around the world, almost all of them went through a phase of concentrated investment and prioritized the construction of railways.

	Japan, the Soviet Union, and Germany invested 55% to 70% of their total national investments in railways. By the early 20th century, the United States had 300,000 kilometers of railways, yet railway investments still accounted for 50% of the national total. At the same time, developed countries levied only symbolic taxes on railways and adopted policies of substantial fiscal subsidies. The United Kingdom levied a 0.01% business tax on railways, the Federal Republic of Germany 0.4%, Japan 1.1%, and the highest, the United States, only 3.2%. According to calculations by the International Railway Union in 1986, out of 43 countries that submitted statistical data, 33 countries had railways operating at a loss. In 1983, countries like the United Kingdom, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Italy subsidized their railways by 41% to 81%. The state's "blood transfusion" and "blood replenishment" policies for railways fully conform to the laws of railway development and national economic growth.

	The direct cause of the severe lag in China's railway development is the serious shortage of investment. At the same time, China has adopted a "bloodletting" policy towards railways in terms of fiscal and tax revenue. Before the economic responsibility system, 15% of business tax had to be paid, and after the system was implemented, it was reduced to 5%. The accumulation rate for railways is as high as around 80%.

	From now until the year 2000, there are only 11 years left. We must, within the range of our national strength, prioritize the development of railways as a key area of national construction.

### 不能搞“抽血”政策

　　不能搞“抽血”政策
    沈阳铁路局局长　李大强　原总会计师　胡国明
    世界各工业发达国家在其经济发展的初期，几乎无一例外地都经过一个密集投资、优先建设铁路的阶段。
    日本、苏联、德国对铁路的投资，分别占当时国家总投资的５５％至７０％。２０世纪初期，美国已拥有铁路３０万公里，然其投资仍占全国投资总额的５０％。同时，发达国家对铁路只象征性地征收微税并采取了巨额财政补贴政策。英国只对铁路征收０．０１％的营业税，联邦德国征收０．４％，日本征收１．１％，最高的美国也只征收３．２％。据１９８６年国际铁路联盟计算，在４３个报送统计资料的国家中，有３３个国家铁路是经营性亏损。１９８３年，英国、法国、联邦德国和意大利等国对铁路的补贴分别是４１％到８１％。国家对铁路的这种“输血”、“补血”政策，完全符合铁路与国民经济发展的规律。
    造成我国铁路发展严重滞后的直接原因，是投资严重不足。同时，我国对铁路在财政税收上采取了“抽血”的政策。经济承包前要交１５％的营业税，承包后降为５％，铁路积累率高达８０％左右。
    从现在起到２０００年只有１１个年头了，我们必须在国力可以承受的范围内，将铁路列为国家建设的重点，优先发展。
