Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 10th.

The Soviet Union has preliminarily determined the cause of the sinking of a Soviet nuclear submarine on April 7th in the North Sea off the coast of Norway. According to a report by the Soviet newspaper *Izvestia* this evening, the submarine experienced a short circuit in its electrical system during its return voyage, which led to a fire. After more than two hours, several explosions were heard from the submarine. It is speculated that these explosions were caused by seven special devices on board the submarine under high pressure. However, the report did not specify what these special devices were. After the accident, the submarine quickly surfaced, but the cracks that appeared in the hull after the explosion caused it to sink. There were 69 people on board. 42 people died, and only 27 survived.

　　苏潜艇沉没缘电路短路
    42人丧生　27人生还
    新华社莫斯科4月10日电　苏联已初步查明苏联核潜艇7日在挪威北部公海沉没的原因。据苏联《消息报》今晚报道，这艘潜艇返航途中电路发生短路，引起火灾。两个多小时后，艇上传出几响爆炸声。据推测，可能是艇上装载的7个特殊装置在高压下发生爆炸。但特殊装置究竟为何物，报道未予说明。事故发生后，潜艇就迅速上浮，但爆炸后船体出现的裂缝，导致下沉。艇上共69人。42人丧生，只有27人生还。
