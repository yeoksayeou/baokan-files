The State Press and Publication Administration decided today to reissue press cards nationwide, aiming to cancel at least 100,000 press cards to stop the current practices of excessive issuance, illicit sale, and forgery of press cards, as well as the use of fake press cards for fraudulent activities.

Lin Fengsheng, director of the Newspaper Bureau of the Press and Publication Administration, told reporters that in recent years, many places across the country have held various types of journalism correspondence courses. Upon completion, certificates were issued to the students, amounting to approximately 10,000 press cards.

The problem of excessive issuance of press cards also exists in many newspaper offices. Lin Fengsheng said that a small newspaper office in Sichuan Province, with only about a dozen editorial staff, issued as many as 200 press cards. Many non-news periodicals issued even more press cards. Preliminary estimates indicate that currently, there are over 300,000 people holding press cards nationwide.

Lin Fengsheng said that the Press and Publication Administration has decided that during this reissuance of press cards, non-editorial staff of newspaper and periodical offices, and non-official staff of newspapers and periodicals will not be issued press cards. If a newspaper or periodical office has a need, a limited number of special correspondent cards can be issued. Each press card or special correspondent card must be stamped with the "Press Card Issuance Special Seal" and the official seal of the newspaper office to be valid.

　　制止滥发变相出卖等现象
　　记者证将重新核发
    新华社北京４月１０日电　（记者黄晓南）国家新闻出版署今天决定在全国范围内重新核发记者证，至少要卡掉１０万多个记者证，以制止目前滥发记者证、变相出卖记者证以及不法分子伪造和冒名使用记者证招摇撞骗的现象。
    新闻出版署报纸局局长林凤生对记者说，近年来全国许多地方纷纷举办各种类型的新闻函授班，结业后，给学员滥发记者证。据初步统计，这类记者证大约发放了１万多个。
    滥发记者证的情况也存在于许多报社。林凤生说，四川省的一家只有十几个采编人员的小报社，居然发放了２００多个记者证。许多非新闻性期刊发放的记者证更是不计其数。据粗略统计，目前，全国持有记者证者已多达３０多万人。
    林凤生说，新闻出版署决定，在这次重新核发记者证中，对报、刊社的非采编人员，非报刊的正式工作人员，一律不许发给记者证。若报刊社确有需要，可发给少量特约记者证。每个记者证或特约记者证须印有“记者证核发专用章”和盖有报社公章，方为有效。
