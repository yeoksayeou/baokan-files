Insurance companies are set to bolster the confidence of enterprise leaders by introducing a new insurance scheme. The China People's Insurance Company has announced that it will soon launch a nationwide personal accident insurance program for factory directors and managers. The aim is to provide economic compensation to these leaders in the event of accidental injuries, thereby encouraging them to push forward with reforms.

According to the newly drafted "Factory Director and Manager Personal Accident Insurance Clauses," this insurance will cover factory directors, managers, and senior technical personnel as the primary insured individuals. Spouses, children, and parents who live with these enterprise leaders can also be included as additional insured individuals. The maximum insurance amount for each enterprise leader is 50,000 yuan, while each additional insured individual can be covered for 20% of the primary insured's amount, with a maximum of five additional insured individuals per enterprise leader.

It is understood that once enterprise leaders participate in this insurance program, if they suffer intentional harm from others while lawfully exercising their duties, resulting in death or permanent loss of all labor capacity for themselves or their additional insured family members, the insurance company will provide economic compensation to the insured individuals and their additional insured family members.

　　保险公司为企业负责人撑腰壮胆
    厂长经理意外伤害保险将开办
    据新华社北京４月２日电  （记者丁坚铭、实习生徐伟）记者从中国人民保险公司了解到，保险公司近期将在全国范围内开办厂长、经理人身意外伤害保险。开办这种保险，旨在给厂长、经理搞改革撑腰壮胆，使其在一旦遭受意外伤害后，能得到一定的经济补偿。
    据了解，按照新近制订的《厂长、经理人身意外伤害保险条款》规定，这一险种将以厂长、经理和高级技术人员等为被保险人，与企业领导住在一起的配偶、子女、父母可作为连带被保险人一起参加保险。参加保险的企业领导最高保险金额为５万元，每位连带被保险人的保险金额是被保险人保险金额的２０％，每位企业领导的连带被保险人不能超过５位。
    据悉，企业领导参加这项保险后，如在依法行使职权过程中遭他人故意伤害，致使自己或连带被保险亲属死亡或永久丧失全部劳动能力，保险公司将对被保险人和连带被保险人给予一定金额的经济补偿。
