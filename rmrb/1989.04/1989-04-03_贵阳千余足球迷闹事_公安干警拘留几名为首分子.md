Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, April 2nd

	Today afternoon, after the final match of the Second Spring City Beauty Cup Football Invitational Tournament ended at the Six Broad Gate Stadium in Guiyang, a disturbance occurred among the football fans. Several ringleaders were detained on the spot by police officers on duty.

	The cause of the disturbance was that many fans believed that the Liaoning Dongyao team and the Dalian Star Sea team, both from the same province, did not play actively, suspecting that there was an unspoken agreement between them. Although the Liaoning team won 2-1 against the Dalian team, many spectators were still dissatisfied.

	After the match ended, fans started throwing fruit pits, drink boxes, and other items onto the field. Around 4 PM, some fans on the south stand set fire to the advertisement board frames below. Subsequently, over a thousand fans rushed into the field, smashing more than a dozen glass windows and destroying the chairs and tables on the stage.

	Later, the fans rushed to the Eight-Corner Rock Hotel where the teams were staying, smashing the windows of the vans that transported the athletes, and blocking the entrance to the hotel, attempting to enter and confront the athletes and coaches.

	Around 5 PM, police officers detained several ringleaders on the spot. After propaganda and guidance, by 6 PM, over a thousand fans had dispersed.

　　贵阳千余足球迷闹事
    公安干警拘留几名为首分子
    据新华社贵阳４月２日电  （记者房方、王念）今天下午，在贵阳市六广门体育场进行的第二春城竞美杯足球邀请赛决赛结束后，发生了球迷闹事事件。几名带头闹事者当场被公安执勤人员拘留。
    这次闹事的起因是，许多球迷认为参加决赛的辽宁东药队和大连星海队踢得不积极，猜测同属一省的这两支球队互相之间有君子协定。虽然辽宁队以２∶１胜大连队，但许多观众仍不满意。
    比赛结束，球迷们纷纷向场内扔果核、饮料盒等物。４时许，南看台一些球迷点燃了看台下的广告牌架。接着，上千名球迷涌进场内，砸毁十几扇玻璃窗，捣毁主席台桌椅。
    随后，球迷们冲到运动队下榻的八角岩宾馆，砸毁了接送运动员的面包车玻璃，堵在宾馆的楼前，要冲进去找运动员和教练“算账”。
    ５时许，公安干警当场拘留了几名带头闹事者。经过宣传和疏导，６时许，千余名球迷已经散去。
