	Also on the Uniformity of Architecture
    Gù Mèngcháo

    “Uniformity” seems to have become a settled conclusion, an accusation from which contemporary Chinese architecture cannot escape. In recent years, people's dissatisfaction with the appearance of our cities and the level of architectural design has often been summed up with the phrase “uniformity.” This has led to widespread discussions, criticisms, and calls for change within and outside the architectural community. In fact, the forms of architecture and the appearance of our cities have indeed become quite varied. However, despite the tremendous changes over the past decade, they are still criticized as “uniform.” Why is this? It is indeed worth pondering for both the speaker and the listener.

    Modern urban residences are the most frequently criticized for being “uniform,” all being “square boxes.” In fact, this is a very scientific matter. China has the traditional saying “heaven is round, earth is square.” The “square box” is a great creation of human civilization and a symbol of the industrial age. Precisely because it is a square box, it can be constructed on a large scale and at high speed, thus more timely solving the pain and troubles of tens of millions of people who lack their own independent living space, bringing them a sense of happiness and a feeling of modernity. Therefore, there are two completely different attitudes towards the square box: those who have a house often coldly comment on how ugly these square boxes are; while those without a house, when they finally get a modern square box residence, cannot help but shed tears of joy. They have longed for their own “square box” day and night. Facing the reality of tens of millions of people without housing in our domestic cities, it seems that square boxes are unavoidable. This is true throughout history and across different countries. In foreign developed countries and regions, the most numerous type of housing is still affordable housing, which belongs to the category of owner-occupied housing with medium and low standards, and is basically uniform.

    From this, we can see that “uniformity” itself has its own regularity and cannot be artificially and subjectively avoided at any time or in any issue. In the initial stage of socialism, the uniformity of housing is inevitable. When the pattern of housing commercialization and privatization is formed, the situation of housing diversification will also appear simultaneously.

    Therefore, I believe that, to some extent, our country, as an industrially underdeveloped nation, is not too “uniform” at present, but rather not “uniform” enough. In foreign developed countries, the process of housing commercialization, privatization, and socialization that housing construction has gone through is a universal law. If we do not follow this law, we will not have a multi-tiered, high-level “uniformity,” but only a uniform “uniformity” like a communal pot, which cannot mobilize the enthusiasm of the state, collective, and individual, and promote the emergence of a diversified and modern housing situation. Therefore, it is not appropriate to blindly reject “uniformity” without analysis. We should appropriately study why “uniformity” appears, which level and aspect of “uniformity” it belongs to, whether it is all a negative phenomenon, or whether there is some law behind it...

    In summary, the current “uniformity” argument itself is also too “uniform,” lacking much novelty, and we do not hear much in-depth insight. Therefore, I dare to be bold and express my surprise here.

　　也谈建筑的千篇一律
    顾孟潮
    “千篇一律”，似已定论，成为中国当代建筑无法开脱的罪名。近年来，人们对我国城市面貌、建筑设计水平的不满常常用“千篇一律”一言以蔽之。因此也引起建筑界内外毫不疑义地共讨之、共诛之、共变之。其实，我国的建筑形式、城市面貌确实已千变万化起来，然而何曾想到，尽管近十年发生巨大变化，仍被评为“千篇一律”。这是为什么？确实值得论者和听者都认真地思索一下。
    现代城市住宅是遭“千篇一律”的谴责声最高的，都是“方盒子”。其实这是很科学的事。中国有“天圆地方”的传统说法。“方盒子”正是人类文明的伟大创造，是工业化时代的标志。正因为是方盒子，才能够大规模、高速度地进行建设，才能更及时地解决千百万没有自己独立生活空间的人的痛苦和烦恼，给他们带来一点幸福感和现代化的感受。所以，对方盒子有两种截然不同的感情：“有其屋者”往往冷眼旁观地评论这些方盒子如何面目可憎；而无房户则当有了一套现代化的方盒子住宅时，会禁不住热泪盈眶，他们曾两眼圆睁，朝思暮想着有自己的“方盒子”。面对国内城市有几千万无房户的现状，看来方盒子是非建不可的。古今中外概莫能外。国外发达国家和地区，住宅中同样数量最多的是廉租屋，属居者有其屋层次、中低标准的住宅，基本上也是千篇一律。由此可见“千篇一律”本身有其规律性，不能人为地、主观地想在什么时候、什么问题上都摆脱“千篇一律”。在社会主义初级阶段的经济背景下，住宅的千篇一律是难以避免的，当住宅商品化、私有化的格局形成之时，住宅多样化局面便同时出现。
    因此我认为，从某种意义上讲，我国作为工业尚不发达的国家，现在不是“千篇一律”得太过分，而恰恰是尚不够“千篇一律”。在国外发达国家，住宅建设所走过的住宅商品化、私有化和社会化是普遍规律。我们如不按这条规律办事便没有多层次的、高水平的“千篇一律”，而只有大锅饭式的“千篇一律”，不能调动国家、集体、个人三方面的积极性，促成住宅多样化、现代化局面的出现。因而，不能不加分析地盲目排斥“千篇一律”，适当去研究为什么会出现“千篇一律”？属于哪个层次、哪个方面的“千篇一律”？是否均属不良的现象，还是背后有什么规律使然……。总之，目前“千篇一律”的论调本身也太“千篇一律”了，没有多少新意，听不到多少深入的见解，所以不揣冒昧地在这里大惊小怪了一番。
