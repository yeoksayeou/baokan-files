Zhao Ziyang Meets Martinez

Beijing, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Zhao Ziyang, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, met with Victor Martinez, Vice President and Senate President of Argentina, this afternoon at Zhongnanhai.

Zhao said that although China and Argentina are far apart and have different social systems, the two countries have more in common than differences. Both are major developing countries that have faced similar historical experiences and now confront common tasks. The two sides can cooperate well. As exchanges between leaders and people from various sectors of the two countries increase, mutual understanding will deepen, and bilateral relations will develop in both depth and breadth.

Speaking on the international situation, Zhao said that the current international situation shows a trend of easing, although there may still be twists and turns. This trend will continue. Developing countries should seize this opportunity to solve their own problems. Generally speaking, developing countries need certain conditions to develop: politically, they should establish a new international political order based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence; economically, they should establish a fair and reasonable new international economic order. While promoting South-South cooperation, developing countries should also coordinate well to push developed countries to adopt more open-minded and far-sighted policies in improving North-South relations.

Martinez briefed Zhao on the domestic situation in Argentina and expressed his willingness to work towards promoting Latin American integration, which he said is of special importance. Latin American integration, he said, can bring development to Latin American countries and promote the cause of peace in the region; it is beneficial to regional development and to the development of the world.

　　赵紫阳会见马丁内斯
    本报北京３月３１日讯  记者顾玉清报道：赵紫阳总书记今天下午在中南海会见了阿根廷副总统兼参议长维克托·马丁内斯。
    赵总书记说，中阿两国相距遥远，社会制度不同，但两国的共同点大大超过两国间的差异。中阿两国都属发展中国家的大国，历史上有过相似的遭遇，今天又面临共同的任务，双方可以进行很好的合作。随着两国领导人和各方面人士互访的增多，两国相互了解的加深，将使两国关系更好地向深度和广度发展。
    在谈到国际形势时，赵总书记说，现在的国际形势出现了缓和的趋势，虽然可能还会遇到曲折，但这种趋势会继续下去。发展中国家应该利用这个机会，解决自己的问题。总的说来，发展中国家为了发展自己，需要一定的条件：政治上，应该建立以和平共处五项原则为基础的国际政治新秩序；经济上，要建立公平合理的国际经济新秩序。发展中国家在促进南南合作的同时，还要很好地协调，推动发达国家在改善南北关系上采取更开明更富有远见的政策。
    马丁内斯副总统向赵总书记介绍了阿根廷国内的情况，并表示，阿根廷愿在推动拉丁美洲一体化方面作出努力，因为这具有特殊的重要意义。拉美一体化，既可以给拉美国家带来发展，也可以推动拉美的和平事业；既有利于地区的发展，也有利于世界的发展。
