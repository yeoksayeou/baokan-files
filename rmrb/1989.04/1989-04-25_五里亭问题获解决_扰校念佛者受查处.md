The Five Li Pavilion Issue Resolved: Disturbers of School Prayer Activities Face Investigation

    The People's Daily published a photo on March 15, 4th edition, criticizing the transformation of Yangqiao Primary School in Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, into a Buddhist temple. Recently, the Party Committee and government of Guangyi Township in the suburban area of Wuxi decided to give an administrative demerit to the direct responsible person for the disturbance, the farm manager Zhou Zhiliang, and impose a fine on him. The seriously derelict school principal Long Tingquan has been removed from his position.

    The People's Daily published an article titled "The Tale of Five Li Pavilion" on April 12, 4th edition, revealing the hardships faced by Zhang Hongbin and his wife, who make a living by scavenging, after they lovingly adopted more than 20 abandoned infants. Recently, the government of Jinhua City, Zhejiang Province, announced: allowing Zhang Hongbin and his wife to register as residents in a suburban township and settle locally; appropriately improving their living conditions, with part of the funds provided by the municipal and district civil affairs departments.
