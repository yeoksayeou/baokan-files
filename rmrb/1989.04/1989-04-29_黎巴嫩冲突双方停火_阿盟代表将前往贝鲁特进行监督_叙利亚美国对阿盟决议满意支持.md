Lebanese conflict parties cease fire

Arab League representatives to go to Beirut for supervision

Syria and the U.S. satisfied and supportive of the Arab League resolution

BEIRUT, April 28 (Xinhua) — The warring parties in Lebanon—the Lebanese Christian government forces and the Syrian military along with their Muslim militia supporters—ceased fire today at noon in Beirut in response to the call from the Arab League Council of Ministers to end the seven-week-long bloody conflict.

The Arab League Council of Ministers concluded a two-day emergency meeting in Tunis last night. The resolution called for all parties in the Lebanese conflict to cease fire starting from noon local time on April 28, to open all ports and passages, and to dispatch an Arab peacekeeping force to monitor the ceasefire.

Christian interim Prime Minister Michel Aoun today welcomed the Syrian military's lifting of the blockade on the "legitimate ports," but added that Muslim ships must follow the instructions of the maritime authorities to enter the government-controlled legitimate ports.

This implies that Aoun does not intend to end the blockade on the illegal Muslim ports. It was the decision to close the illegal ports that triggered this seven-week-long fierce battle.

TUNIS, April 28 (Xinhua) — According to a report by the Tunisian African News Agency today, Arab League Deputy Secretary-General Rahdar Ibrahim and Kuwaiti Ambassador to Syria Jassim will go to Beirut in the coming days to supervise the ceasefire in Lebanon, which was decided by the Arab League Council to take effect from noon on April 28.

DAMASCUS, April 28 (Xinhua) — The Syrian government today expressed satisfaction with the resolution passed by the Arab League Council of Ministers on April 27 regarding the Lebanese crisis.

A semi-official Syrian newspaper today stated that Syria opposes the internationalization of the Lebanese issue, supports the resolution of the Lebanese crisis through negotiations, and regards the aforementioned Arab League resolution as the correct path to ease the tense situation in Lebanon.

WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) — U.S. State Department spokesperson Margaret Tutwiler today issued a statement expressing support for the proposal by the Arab League foreign ministers to implement a ceasefire in Lebanon and to send observers to monitor the ceasefire.

Tutwiler said, "The U.S. welcomes the Arab League's persistent efforts to restore security and stability in Lebanon." She urged the Arab League to continue its efforts "to help Lebanon resolve its political stalemate."

Tutwiler once again emphasized that the U.S. demands the withdrawal of foreign troops from Lebanon, the disbanding of militia groups, and the restoration of Lebanon's sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity.

    阿盟代表将前往贝鲁特进行监督    
    叙利亚美国对阿盟决议满意支持
    新华社贝鲁特４月２８日电  黎巴嫩交战双方——黎巴嫩基督教政府军和叙利亚军队及其支持的穆斯林民兵今天中午在贝鲁特停火，以响应阿拉伯联盟部长理事会的呼吁，结束这场历时７周的流血冲突。
    阿盟部长理事会２７日晚在突尼斯结束了两天的紧急会议。会议决议要求黎巴嫩冲突各方从当地时间２８日１２时起停火，开放一切港口、通道，并派一支阿拉伯维持和平部队赴现场监督停火。
    基督教临时政府总理奥恩今天对叙军解除对“合法港口”的封锁表示欢迎，但又说，穆斯林的船只需按照海事机构指挥，进入政府军控制的合法港口。
    这意味着，奥恩并不打算结束对穆斯林非法港口的封锁。正是关闭非法港口的决定，引发了这场７周之久的恶战。
    新华社突尼斯４月２８日电　据突尼斯非洲通讯社今天报道，阿拉伯联盟副秘书长拉赫达尔·易卜拉希米和科威特驻叙利亚大使贾西姆几天内将前往贝鲁特，监督由阿盟理事会决定的从２８日中午起生效的黎巴嫩停火。
    新华社大马士革４月２８日电　叙利亚政府今天对阿拉伯联盟部长理事会２７日就黎巴嫩危机通过的决议表示满意。
    叙利亚一家半官方报纸今天说，叙利亚反对把黎巴嫩问题国际化，支持通过谈判解决黎巴嫩危机，并把阿盟上述决议作为缓和黎巴嫩紧张局势的正确途径。
    新华社华盛顿４月２８日电　美国国务院发言人塔特怀勒今天在一份声明中表示，美国支持阿拉伯联盟国家外长关于在黎巴嫩实行停火和派遣观察员以监督停火的建议。
    塔特怀勒说，“美国对阿盟在黎巴嫩恢复安全和稳定所作的坚持不懈的努力表示欢迎。”她要求阿盟继续努力“以帮助黎巴嫩解决他们的政治僵局”。
    塔特怀勒再次强调，美国要求外国军队撤出黎巴嫩，解散民兵组织，在黎巴嫩恢复主权、团结和领土完整。
