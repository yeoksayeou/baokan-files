The articles in the "ant nest"

On a spring night several years ago, Lin Xingsheng, the secretary of the Shantou Municipal Party Committee, and Mayor Chen Yanfa stood on the intersection of the Tropic of Cancer and the South China Sea coast, gazing at the early night's dark blue sea dotted with fishing lights and the lights on the opposite island. Behind them lay the renowned commercial port of Shantou, which has a history of over a century. The waves crashed against the shore. A water pipe, the second longest in the world, and a sea-crossing bridge, the longest in China, would stretch from their feet across the sea. A quasi-highway (a fully enclosed first-class dedicated road) would connect here to Shenzhen and then to Hong Kong's Kowloon. A 300,000-kilowatt power plant would be built on the newly developed island area at the other end of the sea-crossing bridge. The terminal of the Guangzhou-Meizhou-Shantou railway and a deep-water port capable of docking 30,000-ton ships would be completed behind them. In the last 11 years of this century, this series of transportation and energy facilities would create a new Shantou and bring a glorious hue to the nearly 10,000 square kilometers of land under its jurisdiction—the magical Hanjiang Delta. The sea breeze rustled Lin Xingsheng's clothes and Chen Yanfa's hair. The waves crashed against the shore. Silence. A meteor brightly streaked across the night sky and then faded into oblivion. The universe silently created and destroyed.

"Shantou should have become China's Los Angeles," Lin Xingsheng said.

Indeed, Shantou was not without such an opportunity. In 1861, Shantou became one of the treaty ports for direct trade between China and foreign countries. Seventy years later, by the 1930s, Shantou was at its peak, becoming China's third-largest port in terms of cargo throughput, second only to Shanghai and Guangzhou. At that time, its scale was comparable to that of Los Angeles in the United States. Passenger and quasi-passenger transport were also quite developed. In the last three decades of the 19th century alone, 1.5 million Chinese laborers were shipped from Shantou Port to overseas destinations. At the beginning of the 20th century, Shantou Port had direct navigation with major ports in Europe and America. In 1858, Engels mentioned Shantou in his article "Russia's Success in the Far East," saying: "Shantou, the only port with some commercial significance, is not one of the five open ports." At that time, Shantou had not yet been opened, but Engels paid special attention to it, which shows its commercial significance.

However, after more than half a century of human history, the annual cargo throughput of the Port of Los Angeles had become 25 times that of the 1950s, while Shantou's cargo throughput remained the same. By 1983, when the city-county integration system was implemented, Shantou, as the capital of the eight counties and one city of Chaozhou and Shantou, with a population of 9.04 million people, had already fallen from being the second-largest city in Guangdong to being behind Foshan and Shenzhen.

That year, at the beginning of the city-county integration system, Secretary Lin Xingsheng and the former mayor also stood on this coast, gazing at the sea and planning the development concept for this corner of the Chaozhou Plain to bid farewell to stagnation and shake off backwardness. It was a macro concept and also a heavy burden like lead.

The Chaozhou Plain is located in the east of Guangdong, south of Fujian, at the southern end of the Nanling Mountains, and on the northern edge of the South China Sea. It is surrounded by mountains on three sides and the sea on one side, with rivers and fertile fields in between. The rivers are clear, and the fields are lush; ancient towns and old villages reflect the new city; the mountains are lush, and the sea is vast, with the wind blowing the trees low to reveal white sails; the climate is mild, and the environment is beautiful. Compared to the savage scenery described by Han Yu, a famous scholar of a thousand years ago, who was exiled here for opposing the Buddha's bones, "the southern border of the prefecture, the sea rises to the sky; poisonous mist and malaria, often at dusk, 'evil crocodiles devour livestock, fierce tigers eat people,'" it is a completely different world. Perhaps because the heavens were too generous, whenever there was war or famine in the north, northerners would migrate here in batches; the local people also reproduced quickly, making it one of the most populous regions in the world's most populous country—it feeds nearly 1% of the country's population on 1/1000 of China's territory! The population density is 8 times the national average and 27 times the world average.

It can be said to be a densely populated "ant nest."

That year (1983), the Chaozhou Plain handed over to the new party and government leadership of the merged Shantou City a test paper: how to feed and feed well a population of nearly 10 million with an average cultivated land area of only 0.33 mu and an average monthly income of 27.4 yuan for farmers?

Six years later, Shantou had changed. The total industrial and agricultural output value was 2.8 times that of six years ago, and the average annual income of farmers was 750 yuan. It can be said that the people in this "ant nest" are now living quite well, with high-rise buildings, bustling streets, wide roads, and ancient towns adjacent to new villages. Lin Xingsheng and Chen Yanfa stood under the starry sky, facing this coastal port city and its eight counties and one special zone (the original Shantou jurisdiction's Chaozhou City was listed as a provincial city on January 1, 1989), the same land and the same people, just by looking at the changes in these six years, they had reason to feel pleased.

The Mystery of Prosperity

The "ant nest's" grain strategy

Chaozhou agriculture is known as "embroidery agriculture." Chaozhou people use their hoes as embroidery needles, embroidering high-yield rice fields on this fertile land, creating a "golden field of plenty." Chenghai County, the first county in China to achieve a double-crop rice yield of 1,000 jin per mu in 1987, is one of Shantou's counties.

For five thousand years, Chinese people have almost entirely relied on the land for their livelihood. The hoe is the lifeline of the Chinese people.

The land of Chaozhou has been groaning under the pressure of the population. Therefore, Chaozhou people have had to expand outward to find a way out. Since the first red-headed ship carrying Chaozhou laborers set sail from the port of Zhanglin in Chenghai in the early 18th century, the footprints of Chaozhou people have spread almost all over the world. According to the "International Chao Association," there are more than 13 million Chaozhou people and their descendants living in various parts of the world.

The closed-door policy at the beginning of the founding of New China suppressed the outflow of population, and the "grain-first" slogan led to the model of "agriculture = grain; grain = rice," which tied hundreds of thousands of hardworking and intelligent Chaozhou people to that small piece of land for a long time. Therefore, Chaozhou people tried to migrate to other regions of the mainland.

Close-up lens one: In Chenghai County, next to the county seat, there is a production brigade called Xinning. Faced with overpopulation, in 1969, 300 young men and women were selected to form an "expeditionary force," led by the brigade's party branch secretary Guo Jinmian, to go to the Liumu Mountain area in Hainan Island to open up and build a village. The Pearl River Film Studio made a documentary about them called "Creating a New Business on the Treasure Island," which made the expeditionary force famous. However, the situation was not ideal. In 1979, the "expeditionary force" returned to their hometown from Hainan Island, not bringing back wealth, but only a few urns of ashes, the first of which was the party branch secretary—the face of that old Chaozhou farmer, with lines etched by decades of hardship.

No one could feed millions of Chaozhou people. The homeland was not without a way out, the key was to break free from the "grain-first" shackles.

Thus, under the new system, the Shantou municipal party and government authorities proposed a new "Chaozhou grain strategy," attempting to solve the historical problem of "high yield but shortage, surplus labor," in short, to make farmers jump out of the narrow channel of relying solely on grain for a living, freeing up some land to plant high-yield, high-value fruit and vegetable crops (farmers call it "growing money"), and then use the "grown" money to buy 3/10 of the deficit grain. This strategy is abbreviated as the "73 grain strategy."

From then on, farmers reopened the door to the forbidden land of high-value crop cultivation outside of rice, creating endless wonders and depth on the limited land: in addition to rice, they select the best crops to plant, whatever the land is most suitable for and whatever has the highest value, they plant that, making the daily labor value of each person on the land no longer equal to the price of an egg laid by a hen; the surplus labor force can leave the land and engage in the secondary and tertiary industries. The former mud-legged farmers are now washing their feet and going to the fields, leaving the land to become entrepreneurs, businessmen, and even financiers. The agricultural county will thus advance towards an industrial county, becoming one of the earliest regions in our disaster-prone republic to bid farewell to poverty and join the ranks of industrialization.

Close-up lens two: It is still the aforementioned Xinning Village that went to Hainan Island: The son-in-law of the old party branch secretary who left his flesh and blood on the reclamation site in Hainan Island, a shrewd man with the spirit of his predecessors and a keen eye for business, Chen Mingzhao, took over as the party branch secretary. The returning expeditionary members and the local elders and fellow villagers, under the new policy of reform and opening up, no longer relied on a single hoe to dig out a meager life, but used their wisdom to start township and village industries, including a wool spinning mill with equipment of international advanced level in 1980, worth 40 million Hong Kong dollars. Although the land was reduced by more than 100 mu compared to 20 years ago, the population increased by more than 1,000, the per capita annual income was nearly 10 times that of 1969, and private villas lined the village, and household appliances and even high-end audio equipment entered ordinary homes. The local labor force was not enough, and they recruited a batch of contract workers from Jiangxi and Fujian.

The same piece of land not only fed the original local population (and lived quite well), but also fed people from other provinces. The land and people did not change, only two words changed: policy. The change of these two words is profound.

The quartet of the fields and the 800-mile factory

The "73 grain strategy" first broke the "grain-first, all-encompassing" policy of poverty, stupidity, and backwardness, squeezing out more value from the limited land.

In February 1984, Hu Yaobang inspected Shantou and summarized Shantou's high-value agriculture as "three major bases": fruits and vegetables, aquatic products, and processing industry. In February 1986, Zhao Ziyang visited Shantou and again affirmed this approach. Later, a fourth base was added: animal husbandry.

In 1988, the fruit output exceeded 10 million dan, vegetables 360 million dan, live pigs nearly 200 million, and agricultural and sideline products earned 1.5 billion US dollars in foreign exchange.

The "73 grain strategy" liberated the surplus labor force in rural areas. Farmers washed the yellow mud off their feet and entered factories at home or near home, becoming producers of industrial products that are sold domestically and even exported overseas, creating in one month or even half a month the value that was created in a year of facing the yellow earth and the sky.

Close-up lens three:

How many township and individual enterprises are there in Chaozhou?

—Wherever there are villages, there are, and wherever there are no villages, there are, totaling more than 100,000. These enterprises are no longer the general concept of ironworks, brick kilns, and hand-sewing, 80s computer-controlled equipment can be seen everywhere, and their products are highly regarded.

A small town in Chaozhou produces high-end clothing products that are seized in Nantong City as smuggled goods from Hong Kong. The clothing and high-end toys recommended to customers in Beijing markets as "Hong Kong goods" are actually the works of Chaozhou farmers. The giant three-layer flower vase presented by Chairman Deng Xiaoping to Chairman Kim Il-sung during his visit to North Korea in 1979 is a product of Lingnan Porcelain in Fengxi. The farmers of Hua'er Village in Chaozhou, once famous as the "begging village," stepped onto the stage of the Great Hall of the People and received the "Qinglong Award for Export Earnings by Township Enterprises" in the dazzling flash of cameras. The former smuggling hub of Xiaoshan Town has completed the tough stage of industrial development, and a new city suddenly emerged in the fields.

In various lenses, the light of the second and third waves of China's mainland, delayed from the eastern coast of the Pacific, first shone on this segment of the golden coastline from Shanghai to Shenzhen, dyeing a colorful dawn.

The flowing river of gold and the "Gypsies of the East"

Overseas Chaozhou people are known as the "Gypsies of the East" for their global presence, tenacious vitality, and strong sense of community. Domestically, Chaozhou's experts and scholars are active in major cities across the country. After the implementation of the open-door policy, the outward-looking economic tradition of Chaozhou people made the three armies of Chaozhou farmers—construction workers, peddlers, and purchasing agents—active across the mainland.

Chaozhou's purchasing agents are the tentacles, straws, and channels of the more than 100,000 enterprises of various types in the homeland. They combine purchasing, sales, and information into one, brave and agile, venturing out alone with only a few not-so-fluent Mandarin phrases. The town of Jiucun in the mountainous area of Raoan County, with 600 purchasing agents accounting for 1/10 of the total labor force, pushed Raoan's daily-use ceramics from the banks of the Huangpu River to the foot of the city of Qin Shi Huang's capital and the hometown of Genghis Khan, making Raoan's daily-use ceramics the largest in sales volume in the country, becoming a powerful enterprise force.

Chaozhou, with 140,000 to 200,000 construction workers, set out from the "basin" of the Hanjiang Delta in the corner of Lingnan, marching towards 20 provinces and cities, from the 53-story China Trade Building in Shenzhen, the tallest building in China, to the Potala Palace in Lhasa. They built high-rise buildings, pavilions, and towers on the scaffolding, even as far as the southern end of the Pacific. The so-called "three floors in three days" speed of Shenzhen is actually the speed of Chaozhou people (created by the Guangdong Second Construction Company of Shantou).

What makes many people ponder is the army of Chaozhou peddlers. The big and small bosses of the fruit and vegetable markets in Shenzhen and Zhuhai almost all speak Chaozhou dialect. A fruit and vegetable aquaculture circulation network created by the people broke the 30-year monopoly of the supply and marketing cooperative system, injecting unlimited vitality into the circulation of Chaozhou's folk economy, thus forming many characteristic professional markets: the citrus market, herbal market, and clothing market in Pengcheng, Jieyang, the scrap metal market in Xianqiao, the several new commercial streets and an "International Commercial Center" with 1,100 shops in Xiaoshan, all magnificent. The gold price fluctuations in the Hong Kong market are known to Xiaoshan merchants every hour... The army of peddlers makes Chaozhou's commodity economy flow with Hong Kong and the mainland, accumulating a new "delta" of wealth in the unceasing flow.

A scholar with a high nose studied the formation of termite mounds and proposed the famous proposition of "from disorder to order" "dissipative structure." We discovered a new solution to how limited land can feed an ever-increasing population from this densely populated "ant nest" by the South China Sea, as well as the historical enlightenment of farmers bidding farewell to the land.

Jesus, rope, gold chain, golden coast

Jesus' birthday

When the wave of industrialization swept over Chaozhou, people naturally should not forget the Jesus of Shantou's modern industry—Lin Xizhi. Because of him, Shantou had his successors, who created so many firsts for the photochemical industry of New China: the first domestically produced photographic paper and software; the first printing plate film; the first news facsimile film; the first satellite cloud map receiving paper; the first peelable film; the first photographic typesetting film and paper; the first printing circuit plate film; the first laser photographic typesetting film.

In 1948, Lin Xizhi, who had just graduated from Shanghai University, began his struggle in the simple laboratory in Shantou, which he did not realize at the time but which had epoch-making contributions to the history of China's photochemical industry. One year later, in June 1949, the first primitive chlorinated paper was finally developed. And in that year, Shantou's industrial output value was negligible.

This negligible figure was accompanied by a monument. History thus combined the joy and sorrow to form the cornerstone of Shantou's modern industry: the glory of single-item championship and the weakness of the overall situation.

About historical reflection

An event that occurred in the past and only affected a few people at the time is discovered by people decades later to have a necessary connection with history, and it is found that it had deeply guided and changed the future course of history. Perhaps Lin Xizhi's original wish did not include this historical feeling, he was only practicing the patriotism of a Chinese intellectual, perhaps it was just some accidental thing that prompted his invention. However, this event has special value in our historical reflection today. It is precisely the tradition of sensitivity and openness to the outside world that Shantou has formed since its opening in 1861 that created the environment and opportunity for Lin Xizhi's success. Close, die; open, live. Although this sentence is not new, for Shantou, which has always been in an open posture in history and closed its door to the world immediately after liberation, the feeling between death and life is strong.

Chen Houshi, the deputy secretary of the Shantou Municipal Party Committee, is a historian. He believes that Shantou's cultural tradition has always been outward-looking, and as long as it insists on openness, there is nothing that Shantou cannot do.

The historical opportunity given to Lin Xizhi made him able to take the American Kodak "Hawlocks" paper as the main target of attack as early as 1948. This determined the level of his inventions and their spiritual influence.

Shantou is poor in industrial resources, so the path to developing heavy industry is blocked. However, it faces a vast overseas market and the demand for industrial products from the ant-like population at home. In modern society, what restricts decision-making is no longer resources; what decides what resources are needed is precisely decision-making.

Three ropes and three gold chains

The Chaozhou Chronicle says: Shantou is the "gateway to the East of Guangdong and the key to the South China Sea." The geographical advantage of being a gateway and a key point in the atmosphere of preparedness for war and strategic layout, however, becomes a disadvantage for industrial development. For a period of time, the state not only could not invest industrial construction funds here but also moved many factories inland. This rope, along with the other two ropes of "grain-first" and "closed-door policy," tied Shantou's industry so that it could not move for a long time.

After the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee, it should have been the time for Shantou's industry to be reborn from the brink of death. However, the Chaozhou people, who had been disappointed for too long, were too hungry to be choosy. Thus, two scenes appeared:

—On the long coastline, smuggling boats and the anti-smuggling team of the Public Security Bureau played a game of hide-and-seek, and low-quality industrial products from abroad radiated inland from the sea, disrupting Shantou's industrial order.

—Many factories were still struggling, hoping for state grants but not daring to use loans to seek development. The leather and plastic industry saw the joke of advanced production lines from abroad being sent to the door but no factory daring to accept them.

However, for decision-makers who are good at summarizing experience, once Shantou is listed as a special economic zone and an open city, they will discover the detours they have taken and quickly get back on track, and thus, new scenes appear:

—Secretary Lin Xingsheng stood on the podium and clearly proposed that Shantou should enter the world economic stage with "a more courageous posture," and the focus of the special zone's work should be on "taking big steps in accelerating development and promoting real industry!"

This is a historical turning point after mature reflection.

Most enterprises opened their arms to welcome transformation, obtaining 1.7 billion yuan in investment. The famous Shantou Photochemical Factory, which created many firsts for New China, introduced and built a color photochemical material production line and established the Shantou Photochemical Group. Together with the ultrasonic instrument industry and the emerging marine audio-visual industry, it formed the three pillars of Shantou's modern industry.

These three pillars are like three gold chains hanging around the necks of the people of Shantou, replacing the three ropes.

Those who wear the gold chains

Whoever truly understands the essence of the three gold chains—the essence of openness—will become their master.

—Six years ago, Zheng Yanhong, the deputy director of the Shantou Materials Bureau, led seven people to establish the "Shantou International Trust Service Company." This company had only three small rooms, three approval documents for establishment, bank account opening, and loans. In a few short years, the company developed into a group company with several hundred million yuan in funds, an annual turnover of 2.2 billion yuan, and the largest hotel in the East Guangdong region. What did it rely on to get rich? Shantou is a hometown of overseas Chinese, and the string of hometown dialect, whether at home or abroad, resonates. Zheng Yanhong and the other eight executives played on the "overseas Chinese" string. From handling the purchase of 10 tons of cement and collecting dozens of yuan in agency fees to major investments of millions of US dollars in hotels. They actually created a path from nowhere.

—Liu Shaozhong, the director of the Shantou Pharmaceutical Factory and a provincial first-class labor model, faced competition from hundreds of pharmaceutical factories across the country and always took innovation as the lifeline of the factory. He did not hesitate to spend a large sum of money to purchase new drug patents. He learned that a foreign heart medicine was very popular in China but was made with pig bile instead of bear bile. If he produced the genuine heart medicine, it would definitely be in demand, so he insisted on buying the patent for 100,000 yuan first. This was the first time in the country. Sure enough, after the drug was put into production, it made hundreds of millions of yuan in profit in just over a year. From 1984 to 1987, the enterprise made a profit of 29.5 million yuan, exceeding the total of 30 years of factory operation. In 1984, the State Council issued a decision to give enterprises more power, and the basic spirit was that factories could operate independently. In the past, drug sales had a three-level distribution model. This model restricted the expansion of drug sales. He found that Guangzhou, a city with a large drug market, did not see the factory's famous product "Yixin Pill," so he decided to break this model and manage the sales of most of the factory's products himself. Someone advised him not to take this risk. But the stubbornness that is difficult to turn back is his entrepreneurial and professional character. He led a small team to promote and sell new drugs across the country, surveying the drug market, and the result was not only Guangzhou but also Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin. Now he is also operating the factory's products in Singapore and Hong Kong, and he swears to make the new and good drugs produced by the factory available all over the world.

—Li Kesheng, the manager of Dahan Plastic Company, is one of the few people who gave up their public jobs to start a factory. In 1971, he gave up his public job of more than 20 years, led five or six people, raised more than 2,000 yuan, and started a small plastic factory. At that time, this was equivalent to being considered a mental patient. He never imagined that in September 1987, 16 years later, he would receive national awards in the Great Hall of the People and personally accept the certificate of "Excellent Farmer Entrepreneur in Contemporary China." Nearly 20 years of running the factory, he has experienced many hardships and suffered from policy changes. Fate determined that he was a person who survived for the future. When he was labeled a capitalist and imprisoned, he never dreamed of the future developments. It was the party's reform and opening-up policy and the advantages of the coastal open policy that saved him. Yes, the law of new life is extremely cruel. The first person to eat crabs is unfortunate and fortunate at the same time. He can be proud of his foresight 20 years ago. As a true person who dares to struggle with life, he has come through.

The golden coast

The Shantou Special Economic Zone is the least funded by the state, with a total investment of 500 million yuan by 1987. To develop this 1.6 square kilometer wasteland and generate high returns with this little investment is a very awkward mission for anyone.

The result? The Shantou Special Economic Zone has been operating for six years, and its economic benefits are the best among the four major special zones in the country. The income is about 50% of the investment. 98% of the foreign investors made money, which is the attraction.

The people of Chaozhou say: "The sun is too far away from us, so we have to bring it closer." "The end of the province, the corner of the country," if "God" does not come, then the Chaozhou people who are good at welcoming "gods" will optimize the investment environment. The beautiful Shantou will not be afraid of the big gods not coming! Now, the area of the special zone has expanded from the original 1.6 square kilometers to 52.6 square kilometers, which is the most eye-catching piece of golden land in the Chaozhou region. The people of Chaozhou have created their own sun.

The light of China

The prosperity of America is soaked with the blood and tears of African slaves in its original accumulation. The development of the American West is also the merit of immigrants. The black writer who traced his roots to the black forests of Africa in the book "Roots" shed tears for America's bloody prosperity when he stepped onto the iron ship that sold black slaves. But history is so ruthless and self-willed.

The first red-headed ship sailed from the port of Zhanglin in Chenghai on which day and at what hour has been forgotten by history, but "helplessly cooking sweet rice cakes" and "carrying a bag over Siam" are the first words of the history of Chaozhou overseas Chinese. As for the Chinese laborers who were sold as "piglets" abroad, their tragic fate added humiliation and bloodshed to these words. After several centuries of struggle, Chaozhou people, with their tenacious and outstanding will and wisdom, have left their footprints all over the world and become an indispensable force in global economic activities. The homeland tugs at the hearts of the wanderers, and the investment of the "three-resource" enterprises in the whole city has reached more than 300 million US dollars.

It was a chilly spring morning in 1968 when the author saw more than a hundred dispirited urban youths being escorted by local militia onto the beach in Guangao. They were handcuffed in groups of four. They boarded a large cement ship to escape to Hong Kong, and as soon as they entered the bay, the ship capsized. They were rescued and captured by the militia. Some of them later went to the Hainan Production and Construction Corps, some crossed the ocean again, and some of them, after several years, returned rich and invested in factories and donated to education...

A history of overseas Chinese is intertwined with the history of Chaozhou's social development. The economic takeoff of Chaozhou cannot be separated from this connection.

The couplet on the Yishan Pavilion of the Chaozhou Association in Thailand reads: "Crossing the black water, drinking bitter water, pouring all my worries into the flowing water; wanting to be a mountain, not returning to Tangshan, ending my old bones in Yishan." The Chaozhou people have a strong sense of hometown. "Walking all over the world, nothing is better than reaching the eastern end of the pier," their psychological support point is always fixed in Chaozhou. This psychological trend makes them regard the prosperity and decline of their hometown as a personal mission that they will not hesitate to undertake. In recent years, the development of education in Chaozhou has always been at the forefront of the province, and the college entrance examination has maintained the champion position for six consecutive years. The moral education experience of primary and secondary schools in Chaozhou City was reported in a special session in the Great Hall of the People on the eve of New Year's Day in 1989, with a shocking effect. This is rare in regions with rapid economic development.

From 1978 to 1987, over a decade, overseas Chinese and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao donated more than 500 million yuan to public welfare projects. Just for primary and secondary schools, 996 schools were built. In addition, Mr. Li Ka-shing alone donated 350 million Hong Kong dollars to establish Shantou University. The school has a complete system of departments and advanced equipment, cultivating talents for the East of Guangdong.

The tide of overseas Chinese donating to education is surging in Chaozhou.

This is a business of burying gold, burying gold for the next century.

On the map of South China, there are two large triangular regions. One is the large triangle formed by Ganzhou, Minnan, and Chaozhou; the other is the large triangle formed by Shantou, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, and these two large triangles radiate inward and outward. Their geographical advantages are waiting to be explored.

And Shantou is located at the third angle of the isosceles triangle connecting Hong Kong and Taiwan. The land of Chaozhou will be gilded with the rising sun of the new century.

　　黄金海岸锦绣文章
  　——潮汕写意
    雷铎　郭小东　晓剑
    “蚂蚁窝”里的文章
    今年的一个初春之夜，管辖粤东八县一特区的汕头市市委书记林兴胜和市长陈燕发，并立在北回归线与南中国海海岸的交叉点上，望着早夜墨蓝色的海面上点点渔火与对岸岛上的灯光，他们的身后，是久负盛名的百载商埠汕头市。海浪哗哗拍击着海岸。一条长度居世界第二的过海输水管和一座长度在国内居首位的跨海大桥将从他们脚下跨越大海，一条准高速公路（全封闭一级专用公路）将从这里到达深圳通往香港九龙，一座二台３０万千瓦的大火力发电站将在过海大桥那端的海岛新开发区上投建，广（州）——梅（州）——汕（头）铁路的终端以及一座三万吨级货轮可以靠岸的深水港码头将在他们身后落成。在这个世纪的最后１１个年头里，这一系列交通能源设施将造就一个新的汕头，并给它辖下的近一万平方公里的土地——神奇的韩江三角洲，抹上一层辉煌的颜色。海风吹动着林兴胜的衣衫和陈燕发的头发，海浪哗哗拍击着海岸。无言。一颗流星明亮地划过夜空，又归于寂灭，宇宙默默地生生灭灭着。
    “汕头本应成为中国的洛杉矶”，林兴胜说。
    是的，汕头不是没有过这种机遇。１８６１年，汕头开埠为中国与“外夷”直接贸易的通商口岸之一。７０年后，至本世纪３０年代，汕头盛极一时，成为货物吞吐量高于天津一倍多、仅逊于上海、广州的中国第三大港口。其时，规模与美国的洛杉矶不相上下。客运和变相客运也相当发达，仅１９世纪最后三个十年，从汕头港运往海外的华工苦力达１５０万人。本世纪初，汕头港已与欧美各主要港口直接通航。１８５８年，恩格斯在《俄国在远东的成功》一文中谈到《南京条约》订立后中国被迫开放的几个口岸时，特别提到汕头，他说：“汕头这个唯一有一点商业意义的口岸，又不属于那五个开放的口岸”，其时汕头尚未开放，恩格斯便格外注意到它，足见它的商业意义。
    然而，当人类社会的发展史册又翻过了半个多世纪之后，洛杉矶港口的年吞吐量已是５０年代的２５倍，而汕头港的吞吐量依然故我，到１９８３年实行市带县新体制，汕头作为潮汕八县一市一万平方公里国土９０４万人口的首府之时，它已经由广东的第二大城市退到佛山、深圳之后了。
    那一年，市带县新体制确立之初，林兴胜书记和前任老市长也曾在这角海岸上瞭望大海，规划着潮汕平原这一角国土告别停滞摆脱落后的发展构想。那是一个宏观的构想，也是一副铅一样沉重的担子。
    潮汕平原地处粤之东，闽之南，南岭南端，南海北缘。三面有山，一面有海，中有江流沃野；江流练，野铺茵，古镇老村映新城；山苍苍，海茫茫，风吹树低见白帆；气候温和，环境优美。与一千多年前“文起八代之衰”的韩愈谏迎佛骨谪贬到这里时的“州之南境，涨海连天；毒雾瘴气，日夕多作”，“恶鳄吞畜，猛虎食人”的蛮荒景象，已是两番天地。或许因为天公过于厚爱，每逢北方战乱或灾荒，北民便成批迁移到这里；这里的子民们又繁殖得快，以至成为当今地球上人口最多的国度里人口密度最大的地区之一——它在占中国版图千分之一的地盘上，养活着全国近１％的人口！人口密度是中国平均密度的８倍、世界平均密度的２７倍。
    堪称一个人满为患的大“蚂蚁窝”。
    那一年（１９８３），潮汕大地交给地市合并后汕头新的党政领导班子的，是这样一张答卷：如何养活和养好人均耕地面积只有０．３３亩，农民人均月收入２７．４元的近千万人口？
    ６年之后，汕头市变样了。工农业总产值是六年前的２．８倍，农民人均年收入７５０元。可以说，如今这个“蚂蚁窝”里的人们已经生活得很不错，高厦林立，车水马龙，通衢如阡陌，古镇接新村。林兴胜和陈燕发站在星空下，面对这座海滨港城和它辖下的八县一特区（原属汕头辖下的潮州市１９８９年元月一日已列入省辖市），同样的天地同样的人，只要看看这６年间的变化，他们有理由感到欣慰。
    繁荣之谜
    “大蚂蚁窝”的粮食战略
    潮汕农业被称为“绣花农业”，潮汕人用锄头做绣花针，在这片膏腴的土地上一锄锄绣出高产水稻的“黄金沃野图”，中国１９８７年第一个双季水稻双千斤县澄海县便是汕头的一个属县。
    五千年来中国人几乎完全靠土地为生，锄头是中国人的命根子。
    潮汕的土地已经在人口的重压下辗转呻吟。于是，潮汕人只有向外扩展寻求出路。自从１８世纪初叶第一条贩运潮汕华工出海的红头船从澄海的樟林港起锚扬帆之后，潮汕人的足迹几乎遍布全世界。据“国际潮团联谊会”统计，旅居世界各地的潮汕籍侨民和华裔已达１３００万之多。
    新中国成立之初的闭关锁国政策扼制了人口的出洋，由“以粮为纲”口号推导出来的“农业＝粮食；粮食＝水稻”的模式把数百万勤劳又聪明的潮汕人长期捆绑在那一小块可怜的土地上。于是潮汕人又试图向大陆别的地区移民。
    特写镜头之一：双千斤水稻故乡的澄海县县城旁边有个信宁生产大队，迫于人口过剩，１９６９年抽出３００余名青壮男女组成一支“远征队”，由大队党支部书记郭锦绵率领，到海南岛黎母山区开荒创村。珠江电影制片厂为他们拍过一部《志在宝岛创新业》的专题纪录片，使远征队声名远播。但是，景况并不美妙，１９７９年，“远征队”从海南岛撤回故土，没有带回财富，只捧回几个骨灰盒，头一个便是党支书——那个脸上刻着几十年人世甘苦的纹路的潮汕老农民的。向内移民失败了。
    没有人能养活数百万潮汕人。本土绝非没有出路，关键在于冲破“以粮为纲”的束缚。
    于是，新体制下的汕头市党政当局提出了一个新的“潮汕粮食战略”，试图解开这道“高产缺粮，劳力过剩”的历史难题，要而言之，便是使农民跳出仅仅以粮为生的狭窄通道，腾出部分土地来，种植高产高值的果蔬作物（农民谓之“种人民币”），再用这“种”出来的人民币，去购买３／１０的缺额粮食。这个战略，简称“七三开粮食战略”。
    从此，农民又重新打开水稻以外的高值作物种植的禁苑之门，在有限的土地上做起无限美妙又无限深刻的文章来：除水稻而外，择优种植，土地最宜于种什么、什么价值高，便种什么，使每个人在土地上每日的劳动价值不再仅仅等于一只母鸡所下一个蛋的价钱；剩余的劳动力，可以离开土地，经营第二产业和第三产业。昔日的泥腿子要洗脚上田，离开土地，成为企业家、贸易家乃至金融家了。农业之乡从此将向工业之乡迈进，成为我们多灾多难的共和国最早告别贫穷，步入工业化行列的地区之一。
    特写镜头之二：还是上述远征海南岛的信宁村：当年将自己血肉之躯留在海南岛垦荒场上的老支书的女婿，一个有着前辈百折不挠精神又有商品眼光的精明汉子陈明昭继任党支部书记。回乡的远征队员和本土的父老乡亲在国家改革开放的新政策之下，不再只靠一把锄头去挖掘拮据的日子，而以其聪明才智办起乡镇工商业，包括投资４０００万港元、具有国际１９８０年先进水平的设备的毛纺厂，虽然土地比２０年前又缩小了１００余亩，人口又增加了１０００多，但人均年收入却是１９６９年的近１０倍，村里私人小楼鳞次栉比，四大家用电器乃至高级音响设备走入寻常百姓家。本地劳动力已经不够使用，他们又从江西、福建招聘了一批合同工。
    同样那块土地，不仅养活了原先养不活的本地人口（并且活得很不错），还养活着从外省他乡来的人们。人和土地不变，只变了两个字：政策。二字之变，意味无穷。
    田野四重奏与八百里大车间
    “七三开粮食战略”首先打破了“以粮为纲、一网打尽”的穷民穷国笨鸟政策，从有限的土地上榨取出更多的价值来。
    １９８４年２月，胡耀邦视察汕头，将汕头的高值农业概括为“三大基地”：果蔬、水产和加工工业。１９８６年２月，赵紫阳莅汕，再次肯定了这套办法。其后，又增加了第四个基地：畜牧。
    １９８８年，水果产量超过一千万担，蔬菜３６０万担，生猪近２００万头，农副产品创汇１．５亿美元。
    “七三开粮食战略”解放了农村富余劳动力，农民洗干净了脚上的黄泥，走进家庭或家门口的工厂，成为行销内地乃至远销外洋工业品的生产者，用一个月乃至半个月创造着过去一年面朝黄土背朝天所创造的价值。
    特写镜头之三：
    潮汕有多少乡镇企业和个体企业？
    ——凡是有村落的地方都有，没有村落的地方也有，总计有１０万之多。这些企业不再是人们一般概念中的铁工厂、土砖窑、手工缝纫，８０年代的电脑集控设备已经到处可见，其产品被人刮目相看。
    潮阳一个小镇生产的高级服装产品在南通市被当做走私的港货查扣。北京市场上小商小贩向顾客们作为“港货”推荐的服装、高级玩具，其实许多是潮汕农民的杰作。１９７９年邓小平主席访朝送给金日成主席的巨型三层通花瓶，是岭南瓷通枫溪的产品。曾以“乞食村”而闻名的潮州华二村农民步上人民大会堂主席台，在耀眼的闪光灯中领取“乡镇企业出口创汇青龙奖”奖杯。当年海上走私品集散地的峡山镇，已完成大办实业的攻坚阶段，一座新城突然诞生于田野之上。
    在各种镜头中，中国大陆迟到的第二、第三浪潮之光从太平洋东岸照射过来，首先在上海到深圳——其间经过潮汕海岸——这段黄金海岸线上，染出一脉七彩的晨曦来。
    流动的黄金河与“东方吉普赛人”
    海外潮汕人因其流布全球、顽强生命力和强烈的社团意识素有“东方吉普赛人”之称。在国内，潮汕的专家学者活跃在全国各大城市。实行开放政策后，外向型的经济传统又使潮汕人的三支农民大军——建筑、商贩和购销员大军活跃在大陆各处。
    潮汕的购销员是本土上十万各类型企业的触须、吸管和通道。他们集采购、推销、信息三种功能于一身，勇敢、灵巧，仅凭几句不很熟练的普通话而只身外闯。地处饶平县山区的九村镇，占总劳动力１／１０的６００多名供销员，将饶平的日用瓷从黄浦江边推至秦始皇帝都的城下和成吉思汗的故乡，使饶平日用瓷产件的销量跃居全国第一，成为一支举足轻重的企业力量。
    潮汕，１４至２０万建筑大军从岭南一隅的韩江三角洲“盆地”祭旗开拔，浩浩荡荡向２０个省市挺进，从中国最高层建筑的深圳５３层国贸大厦到布达拉宫下的拉萨，他们在脚手架上造就一座一座高楼大厦、屋宇台阁，乃至远征到太平洋南端。所谓“三天一层楼”的深圳速度，其实便是潮汕人的速度（由汕头的省二建公司所创造）。
    令许多人击节而沉思的是潮汕的商贩大军。深圳、珠海的果蔬市场的大小老板们几乎一色操潮汕话。一张由民间自发生成的果蔬水产流通网络，打破了３０余年供销社系统一统天下的沉郁局面，为潮汕民间经济血脉的流通注入无限活力，由此而形成了许多各具特色的专业市场：普宁县流沙的柑桔市场、药材市场、揭阳榕城成衣市场、仙桥的废旧钢铁市场、峡山的几条新兴的十里商业街和一座有１１００家店面的“峡山国际商场”，气派非凡。香港市场的黄金价格涨落，峡山商人每小时都了如指掌……商贩大军使潮汕的商品经济与香港和内地交相流汇，在不停顿的流动中冲积出一片新的财富的“三角洲”来。
    有一位高鼻子学者从白蚁窝的形成研究出“从无序到有序”的“耗散结构”著名命题，我们则从南海之滨的这座压力沉重的人的蚂蚁窝里，发现了一点有限的土地如何养活永远是在增长的人口的新解，以及农民告别土地的历史启示。　
    耶稣·绳索·金项链·黄金海岸
    耶稣诞生日
    当工业化浪潮席卷潮汕的时候，人们自然不应淡忘汕头当代工业的耶稣——林希之。因为有了他，汕头才有了他的后继者们，为新中国感光材料工业创立下那么多的第一：第一张国产照相纸和软件；第一张印刷制版胶片；第一张新闻传真胶片；第一张卫星云图接受纸；第一张可剥离胶片；第一张照相排字胶片和第一张照相排字纸；第一张印刷电路制版胶片；第一张激光照相排字胶片。
    １９４８年，从上海大学毕业归来的林希之，在汕头简陋的实验室里，开始了他当时并未意识到而在中国感光材料工业史上却具有划时代贡献的奋斗。一年之后的１９４９年６月１日，第一张原始性氯素纸终于研制成功。而在这一年，汕头的工业总产值微乎其微。
    这个微乎其微的数字旁边，耸立着一块丰碑。历史这样哭笑着组合起汕头当代工业的基石：单项夺标的辉煌和总体格局上的贫弱。
    关于历史的反思
    一个发生在过去的、在它发生时只对少数人产生影响的事件，在若干年后人们才发现它与历史的必然联系，发现它原来曾经那么深刻地导向着、改变着未来的历史进程。也许林希之当初的夙愿中并没有包含着这种历史感受，他只不过实践着一个中国知识分子的报国之志，也许促使他发明的仅仅是某种很偶然的东西。但是，这个事件在我们今天的历史反思中具有特别的价值。正是汕头自１８６１年开埠以来就形成的对外部世界的敏感开放的传统风气，为林希之的成功造就了环境与契机。关则死，放则活，这句话虽然已不新鲜，但对历史上一直呈开放姿态而一解放国门随之关闭的汕头来说，死与活之间的感受是强烈的。
    汕头市委副书记陈厚实是学历史的，他认定汕头的文化传统从来都是外向型的，只要坚持开放，汕头的事情没有办不好的。
    历史赋予林希之的开放机缘，使他在１９４８年就已经能够把美国柯达“淮洛克司”纸作为主攻的目标。这就决定了他创造发明的品位及其精神影响。
    汕头工业资源贫乏，于是发展重工业的来路被堵死了。但是，它却面临着一个广阔的海外市场和本土蚁群般人群的工业品需求。在现代社会，限制决策的，已不再是资源；决定要什么资源的，恰恰是决策。
    三大绳索与三条金项链
    潮汕志云：汕头为“粤东之门户，南海之要冲”。地理上门户要冲之优势在备战气氛与战略格局中，却成为工业发展的劣势。有一段时间，国家不仅不能往此地投入工业建设资金，还往内地搬迁不少工厂，此绳索与“以粮为纲”、“闭关锁国”另两条绳索长期把汕头工业捆绑得不能动弹。
    十一届三中全会之后，应该是汕头工业绝处逢生之时，但是，失望太久的潮汕人过于饥不择食了。于是出现了两种景观：
    ——漫长的海岸线上，走私的渔船与公安局的缉私队在玩捉迷藏的把戏，国外劣质工业品从海上向内陆辐射，扰乱了汕头工业秩序。
    ——许多工厂仍举步维艰，幻想国家拨款而不敢用贷款谋取发展。皮革塑料业就出现外国先进生产线送上门，竟没有一家厂家敢要的笑话。
    但是，对于善于总结经验的决策者来说，汕头一旦被列入经济特区、开放城市，他们便发现了所走的弯路，并迅速步入正轨，于是，新的景观出现了：
    ——市委书记林兴胜站到了讲台上，明确提出汕头应以“更加勇敢的姿态进入世界经济舞台”，“特区的工作重点应在加快开发和兴办实业上迈开大步！”
    这是一个经过成熟反思之后的历史转折。
    大部分企业敞开怀抱，迎接改造，得到１７亿人民币投资。久负盛名、为新中国创造了许多个第一的汕头感光化学厂引进建成彩色感光材料生产线，成立汕头感光集团公司。它与超声仪器工业、新兴的海洋音象工业一起构成了汕头现代工业三大支柱。
    这三大支柱正如同三条金项链一样挂在了汕头人民的颈项上，取代了那三条绳索。
    套上金项链的人
    谁真正懂得三条金项链的精髓——开放的本质意义，谁就会成为它的主人。
    ——６年前，汕头物资局副局长郑延高带领７个人，成立了“汕头国际信托服务公司”。这个公司只有３间平房，三封批准成立、允许银行开户和贷款的文书。短短几年间，公司发展成为拥有几千万元资金，年购销额达２．２亿元，并拥有粤东地区首屈一指大酒店的集团性公司。它靠什么发家？汕头是侨乡，乡音这根弦不管在海内海外，一拨就通。郑延高等８大员在“侨”字上做文章。小至代办１０吨水泥，收取几十元的代买代运费，大至上千万美元的酒店投资。硬是从没有路的地方走出路来。
    ——汕头制药厂厂长、省特等劳动模范刘绍忠，面临全国众多药厂的竞争，始终以创优创新为本厂的生命线。不惜花重金购买新药专利权。他获知国外有一种救心丹在中国极畅销，但却以猪胆充熊胆，如果自己来生产地道的心药一定很抢手，便力主抢先用１０万元购买了这项专利，这在全国是第一遭。果然，此药投产后仅年余就获利数百万元。从１９８４年至１９８７年，企业创利２９５０万元，超过建厂３０年的总和。１９８４年，国务院颁发了给企业扩权的１０条决定，其基本精神就是工厂可以自主经营。过去药品销售有三级批发的模式。这个模式限制了药厂销售的扩展。他发觉销药量极大的广州市居然看不到本厂名牌产品“益心丸”，便决心突破这个模式，自己来经营销售本厂的大部分产品。有人劝他别冒这个险。可是九牛难回的脾气是他的创业与敬业性格。他带领小分队到全国各地宣传推销新药，考察药品市场，结果是不只广州，连上海、北京、天津都打了进去。现在他又与新加坡、香港联合经营本厂产品，他发誓要将本厂生产的新药好药遍及世界各地。
    ——达濠民生塑料公司经理李科生，是全国最早辞去公职自办工厂的少数人之一。１９７１年，他辞去工作了２０来年的公职，带领五六个人，自筹２０００多元资金，办起了小塑料厂，这在当时无异于让人认为是神经病患者。他绝对没有想到，１６年后的１９８７年９月，他会在人民大会堂接受国家的嘉奖，亲手接过“当代中国优秀农民企业家”证书。办厂近２０年，他屡经劫难，饱受政策变动之苦。命运注定他是为着未来而生存的人。当他被戴上资本主义分子的帽子关进监狱时，做梦也没有想到后来的形势发展。是党的改革开放政策和沿海地区的开放优势拯救了他。是的，新生活的规律是极其严酷的。第一个吃螃蟹的人，不幸与有幸的机缘是同等的。他可以为２０年前自己那份超前的胆识欣慰。作为真正的敢于向生活搏击的人，他闯过来了。
    黄金海岸
    汕头特区是国家资金投入最少的，至１９８７年共投资了５亿。用这点投资去开发这１．６平方公里的荒滩而且要产生高效益，这对谁都是一种很窘迫的使命。
    结果呢？汕头特区办了６年，它的经济效益在全国四大特区中是最好的。收入约占投入的五成。来投资的外商９８％赚到钱，这就是吸引力。
    潮汕人说：“太阳离我们太远，我们只好把它拉近。”“省尾国角”、“上帝”不来，那好，善于迎“神”的潮汕人就去优化投资环境。如花似玉的汕头，就不怕大神不来！现在，特区的面积从最初的１．６平方公里扩大到了５２．６平方公里，这是潮汕地区最受世人瞩目的一方黄金宝地。潮汕人创造出了自己的太阳。
    中国之光
    美洲的繁荣，其原始积累中浸着非洲黑奴的血泪。美国西部的开发也是移民的功劳。寻根寻到黑非洲丛林中去的《根》的黑人作家在踏进贩卖黑奴的铁皮船时，他是为美国后来的血腥繁荣流泪的。可是历史这样无情地我行我素。
    第一只红头船在哪一天、哪个时辰漂出澄海樟林港，已为历史淡忘，但“无可奈何炊甜粿”，“背个包裹过暹罗”，却是潮汕华侨史最初的一行字。至于被作为“猪仔”贩到国外的华工，他们悲惨的命运则为这行字涂上屈辱与血腥。经过几个世纪的挣扎，潮汕人以其坚韧卓著的毅力与智慧，足迹遍及全世界，成为世界经济活动中不可忽视的力量。故土牵动游子之心，全市“三资企业”投资达３亿多美元。
    那是１９６８年一个春寒袭人的早晨，笔者在广澳的海滩上，看到当地民兵押送上来上百名失魂落魄的城市青年，４人一排铐着三只手铐。他们乘着大型水泥船逃港，一进妈屿湾船便翻沉，经民兵抢救捕获。他们中有的人后来到海南生产建设兵团去，有的再次远涉重洋出国，其中有的若干年后发财归来，投资办厂，捐资兴学……
    一部华侨史是与潮汕的社会发展史渗透胶合在一起的。潮汕的经济腾飞无法割裂这种联系。
    泰国潮州会馆义山亭有对联：“渡过黑水，吃过苦水，满怀心事付流水；想做座山，无归唐山，终老骨头归义山”。潮汕人的乡土观念极重。“天下行到透，不如达埠东鞍头”，他们心理的支撑点永远固定在潮汕。这种心理趋势使得他们把故乡的兴衰当作个人义无反顾的事业。近年来潮汕教育事业，其发展一直置于全省前列，高考连续６年保持冠军地位，潮州市的中小学德育经验１９８９年元旦前夕在人民大会堂做专场报告，效果轰动。这在经济发展较为迅猛的地区是罕见的。
    １９７８至１９８７年１０年间，华侨港澳同胞捐赠兴办公益事业的款项超过人民币５亿元。光中小学就建了９９６座。此外李嘉诚先生独力捐资３．５亿港元办起了汕头大学。该校系科齐全，设备上流，为粤东培养栋梁之材。
    华侨捐资兴学的热潮在潮汕方兴未艾。
    这是一项埋藏黄金的事业，为下一个世纪埋藏黄金。
    在南中国的版图上，有两个大三角区域。一是赣南、闽南、潮汕连成的大三角；一个是汕头、港澳、台湾连成的大三角区，这两个大三角各向内陆和海外辐射。其经济地理上的优势正待发掘。
    而汕头，正处在连结香港与台湾等腰三角形的第三个角上，潮汕大地将在新世纪太阳升起时镀上黄金的颜色。
