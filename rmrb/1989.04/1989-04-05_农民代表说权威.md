Farmers' Representatives Speak on Authority

    People's Daily reporter ZHU WeiQun

    In the current efforts to rectify and deepen reforms, how party and government organs and leading cadres can establish authority is a topic that representatives frequently discuss. BRU Renbao, the Party Secretary of Huaxi Village in Jiangsu Province, shared his views with a reporter.

    "The first condition for establishing authority is to be clean," said BRU Renbao. "Whether it's the 'big officials' at the central level, the 'small officials' at the local level, or us at the grassroots level, if you are not clean, you definitely won't have any authority!"

    He said, "I have worked at the grassroots level for a long time. Just taking the villages in southern Jiangsu that I am most familiar with, some poor villages have officials who are not poor, and some are even richer than officials in wealthy villages. There was a village where the Party Secretary, who had been in power for only three years, built three stories of a house. Where did the money come from? It's all from embezzlement and corruption! In Huaxi Village, we have had a per capita distribution of over 1,000 yuan for six or seven years, but I, as the Party Secretary, haven't built a three-story house. If you are not clean, the people will point at your back and curse you. How can you have any influence?"

    BRU Renbao believes that the second condition for establishing authority is to know how to lead the people in production and life in the tide of a commodity economy. "Cadres must be knowledgeable, both in their own duties and as versatile hands. If you lead others but don't understand production or accounting, you make a mistake in everything you do, then there is no 'authority'." In Huaxi Village, the Party Committee and village committee cadres all hold actual positions such as factory directors, managers, and accountants in the village's more than 20 enterprises, and all bear economic responsibilities. There are no 'hands-off' cadres. Over the past decade of reform, the village's production has been thriving. Last year, it became the first village in Jiangyin City to reach a billion yuan. The people gain real benefits and are willing to follow the cadres' leadership. "Whether or not you have authority also depends on whether you can stand at the forefront of the people and lead them to overcome difficulties and create new situations when the situation is not good and the people's morale is not high." He said, "In the first and second months of this year, 18 out of the 26 villages in Huashi Town, where we are located, saw a decline in township enterprise production compared to the same period last year, and the total output value of the entire town also declined. Rapid growth is certainly not good, but decline and stagnation are also not acceptable. However, Huaxi Village saw growth compared to the same period last year, which is related to the cadres' spirit."

　　农民代表说权威
    本报记者  朱维群
    在当前治理整顿和深化改革中，党政机关及领导干部怎样才能建立权威，是代表们谈得较多的一个问题。江苏省华西村党总支书记吴仁宝代表，对记者发表了一番见解。
    “建立权威的第一条，是要廉洁。”吴仁宝说：“无论是中央的‘大官’、地方的‘小官’，还是我们这样的乡村基层干部，不廉洁肯定就没有权威！”
    他说：“我长期在基层工作，就拿我最熟悉的苏南农村说，有些穷村的干部却不穷，甚至比富村的干部还富。有个村仅仅当政三年的支部书记，就造了三间楼房。哪里来的钱？还不是损公肥私、浑水摸鱼！我们华西村已有六七年人均分配超千元，我这个党总支书记也没钱去造三上三下的楼房。你不廉洁，老百姓指着脊梁骨骂你，你还有什么号召力？”
    吴仁宝认为，建立权威的第二条，要看会不会在商品经济大潮中把大家的生产、生活搞上去。“干部要懂行，既是自己职责上的内行，同时又是多面手。如果你领导人家，自己却不懂生产、不懂核算，办一件事错一件事，‘威’也就没有了。”在华西村，党总支、村委的干部都分别在全村２０多个企业中担任厂长、经理、会计等实职，都要承担经济责任，没有‘甩手干部’。改革十年来，全村生产蒸蒸日上，去年成为江阴市第一个亿元村。群众获得实际利益，就愿意服从干部指挥。“有没有权威，还要看你在形势不太好、群众劲头不太足的时候，能不能站在群众前面，带领大家克服困难，开创新局面。”他说：“今年一、二月份，我们所在的华士镇２６个村，有１８个村乡镇企业生产比去年同期下降，全镇总产值也下降。增长速度过快固然不好，但是下降萎缩终究也不行。我们华西村却比去年同期增长，这就与干部的精神状态有关。”
