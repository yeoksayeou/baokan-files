Lechang Addresses Traffic Difficulties on the Road; Huguang Highway to Become Smoother

    The Shaoguan to Xiaotang (Xiaotang, Yizhang County, Hunan) highway in Lechang County, Guangdong Province, particularly the section from Lechang to Pingshi, is being urgently repaired. The traffic difficulties at the "Northern Gate of Guangdong" are expected to be resolved in the near future.

    The road from Lechang to Pingshi is a major artery connecting the provinces of Guangdong and Hunan. The section through the Jiufeng Mountain area is particularly challenging, with steep slopes, sharp turns, and narrow roads. In recent years, with the increase in traffic, the road surface has deteriorated significantly, and some sections have collapsed, leading to frequent accidents such as rollovers and traffic jams. Last December, a reporter's letter published in this newspaper criticized the "traffic difficulties at the Northern Gate of Guangdong," which drew the attention of provincial, municipal, and county leaders. Relevant departments quickly dispatched a working group for an on-site investigation and allocated 3 million yuan for the repairs.

　　乐昌治理行车难　湖广公路将顺畅
    本报讯　广东省乐昌县抓紧治理韶（关）小（湖南宜章县小塘）公路乐昌至坪石路段，“广东北大门”行车难的问题可望在近期得到解决。
    乐昌至坪石公路是联接湖广两省的主要通道，其中九峰山一带山高坡陡，弯多路窄。近年来，由于过往车辆剧增，路面磨损严重，部分路段崩塌，翻车、堵车事故时有发生。去年底，本报刊登记者来信，批评“广东北大门行车难”，引起省、市、县领导的重视，有关部门迅速派出工作组实地调查，并拨出专款３００万元。
