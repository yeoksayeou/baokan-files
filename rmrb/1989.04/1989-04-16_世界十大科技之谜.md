The World's Ten Greatest Technological Mysteries

What Obstacles Stand in the Way of Practical Nuclear Fusion?

Nuclear fusion, which uses the inexhaustible hydrogen and helium in the sea as fuel, has long been touted as the "dream energy" that will free humanity from the shackles of energy scarcity. Japan, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the European Community are all conducting research in this area and are indeed steadily approaching the goal, but the final breakthrough has not yet been achieved.

Nuclear fusion research faces three major problems:
1. **Extreme High-Temperature Problem**: It requires temperatures of 100 million to 200 million degrees Celsius. How can materials be developed that can withstand temperatures similar to the surface of the sun?
2. **Magnetic Confinement Problem**: To prevent the plasma heated to 100 million to 200 million degrees from dispersing, it must be confined by a magnetic field; otherwise, nuclear fusion will not occur. This requires the use of a strong magnetic field from superconducting magnets. However, such a strong magnetic field also requires the development of non-magnetic materials.
3. **Material Deterioration Due to Neutron Impact**: Nuclear fusion using hydrogen and helium as fuel releases a large number of high-speed neutrons. These neutrons, upon contact with the atomic components of materials, completely alter their composition. No matter how thick the material surrounding it is, it will eventually be destroyed. Currently, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union have achieved nuclear fusion at room temperature, attracting global attention.

The Intelligent Computer

Artificial intelligence is essentially "making machines mimic human thinking." To achieve this, it is first necessary to understand how human thinking operates. If the attempt to develop artificial intelligence computers falls under the category of "engineering artificial intelligence," then "scientific artificial intelligence" aims to delve deeper into the mechanisms of reasoning. This is an attempt to uncover the general principles behind human cognitive functions such as perception, thinking, memory, learning, and language. This field of study is known as cognitive science.

Current artificial intelligence research is an attempt to understand the workings of the human brain.

The Possibility of Photonic Computers

The photonic computers envisioned today can be roughly divided into two types: one is the "spatial parallel processing type photonic computer" that excels in image processing; the other is the "temporal sequential processing type photonic computer," which has the same structure as conventional computers but uses light instead of electrons.

Room-Temperature Superconductivity Has Not Been Thoroughly Researched

So far, no theory has been able to answer the question of whether "room-temperature superconductivity is possible." Although the United States has announced the discovery of two room-temperature superconducting materials and has applied for patents, these are entirely new substances, and their reliability is questionable. In short, the world is eagerly awaiting the advent of room-temperature superconductivity.

The Method of Making Stainless Iron

As long as the Earth remains a habitable environment for humans, iron will inevitably rust. In the 19th century, British scientist Michael Faraday dedicated himself to the study of stainless iron, ultimately failing, but his research promoted the development of alloy steel and stainless steel across Europe. However, the mechanism by which a non-crystalline alloy state rust forms on such corrosion-resistant steel has not been theoretically explained.

Plastic Cans

Transparent cans made of plastic allow you to see if the contents are fresh and do not have the "tinny" smell of metal cans. However, the biggest drawback of plastic cans is that plastic is a high-molecular material, and the gaps between its molecules absorb odor molecules, causing the food to lose its flavor. There are also other drawbacks. Plastic cans are currently in the stage of identifying and addressing these issues one by one. If these drawbacks can be overcome, a new packaging revolution may be on the horizon.

　　世界十大科技之谜
    核聚变实用化的障碍何在？
    把海中无穷尽的氢氦作为燃料的核聚变，早就有人说它是把人类从能源桎梏中解放出来的“梦想的能源”。日、美、苏、欧洲共同体都在进行这方面的开发，并且确实在稳步地接近于目标，但现在还没有最后突破。
    核聚变的研究面临３个问题：①超高温问题。它需要１亿到２亿度这样的超高温。怎么才能研制出能耐过与太阳表面温度相同的超高温的材料？②磁力封闭问题。要想使加热到１亿到２亿度的等离子体不致飞散，必须用磁场封闭，否则核聚变不会开始。这就需要使用超导磁石的强大磁场。谈到那样强大磁场又必须找出不磁化的材料。③材料因中子的作用而劣化问题。以氢氦为燃料的核聚变，有大量高速中子被释放。这种中子线一接触材料的原子成分就会完全改变。无论使用多么厚的材料围住，但最后都会遭到破坏。眼下，美、英、苏等国在室温下实现了核聚变，引起了世界关注。
    　　　　进行智能活动的电算机
    所谓人工智能就是“让机器模仿人的思维”。为此，首先必须探明人的思维是如何活动的。如果说研制人工智能电算机的尝试属于“作为工程技术的人工智能”领域，那么，“作为科学的人工智能”就是试图更深入地探明推理机制。这就是想探明人所具有的知觉、思维、记忆、学习、语言等认识功能的一般原理的一种尝试。称这种学问为认知科学。
    现在的人工智能是试图探明人脑的一个科学领域。
    　　　　实现光电算机的可能性
    现在设想的光电算机大致分为两种，一种是在图象处理方面发挥威力的“空间并行处理型光电算机”；另一种是“时系列处理型光电算机”，其结构与普通电算机相同，但使用光代替电子。
    　　　　室温超导未作高级研究
    到目前为止，任何理论都还回答不了“实现室温超导是否可能”的问题。虽然美国已宣布确认了两种室温超导物质并已申请专利。但都是崭新物质，据认为可靠性不大。总之，全世界都在期待着室温超导的出现。
    　　　　不锈铁的制造法
    只要地球是人容易生活的环境，铁就必然生锈。１９世纪，英国科学家法拉第埋头研究过不锈铁，最后以失败告终，但他的研究却促进了整个欧洲的合金钢发展，不锈钢，接着耐侵蚀性钢终于问世。但是在这种耐侵蚀性钢上形成无结晶合金状锈的机制，还没有从理论上解释清楚。
    　　　　塑料制的罐头
    用塑料制的透明罐装成的罐头，一看就可以知道里边的东西是否新鲜，而且不会有金属罐那种“罐臭味”。但是，塑料制的罐头最大的缺点是由于塑料是高分子材料，分子的间隙吸收味分子，食品会失掉香味。还有其它一些缺点。塑料罐头现在正处于要一一查清其缺点的阶段。如果克服了各种缺点，很可能引起新的包装革命。（下）
