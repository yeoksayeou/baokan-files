Xinhua News Agency, Washington, April 26th.

Despite repeated assurances from the U.S. government that the sudden resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru will not affect U.S.-Japan relations, local opinion holds that the sudden change in the Japanese government may cause temporary instability in these relations.

White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater has stated that the U.S. government will "continue to maintain close cooperation with the new prime minister and new government." However, opinion suggests that future troubles between the U.S. and Japan will focus on issues such as Japan's $50 billion trade surplus with the U.S., U.S. demands for Japan to take on more defense responsibilities, and criticism of Japan's high trade deficit with the U.S.

Democratic leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, Tom Foley, believes that unless Japan forms a new, strong government, it will be "extremely difficult" for the U.S. to gain more trade concessions from Japan.

Dr. Ellis Joffe, a Japan expert at the University of California, speculates that the new government may be weak and unable to take bold actions. Therefore, he believes it will be difficult to make Japan change its trade, defense, and economic policies in accordance with U.S. wishes.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, April 26th.

Today's issue of the Wall Street Journal reports that U.S. trade officials expect that the resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru may make it more difficult to resolve trade disputes between the U.S. and Japan.

The report states that during Takeshita's tenure, Japan has made significant concessions to the U.S. on trade issues. Currently, there are still many conflicts between the U.S. and Japan on trade. Some in the U.S. Congress have already called for Japan to be listed as a country conducting unfair trade with the U.S., and for trade sanctions to be imposed on Japan. The report believes that given the current situation in the Japanese government, which is plagued by corruption scandals, it is impossible for Japan to make comprehensive concessions on trade issues.

　　美国舆论认为    
    竹下辞职将影响美日关系
    新华社华盛顿４月２６日电  尽管美国政府一再表示日本首相竹下登的突然辞职不会影响美日关系，但此间舆论普遍认为日本政府的突然更替可能给美日关系造成短暂的动荡不定。
    白宫发言人菲茨沃特已表示，美国政府将“继续同新首相和新政府保持密切合作”。不过，舆论认为美日间今后的麻烦将集中表现在日本对美国的５００亿美元贸易顺差，美国会要求日本更多地承担防务义务和日本对美居高不下的赤字的批评等问题上。
    美众议院民主党领袖弗利认为，除非日本组成一个新的强有力的政府，否则美国想从日本那里赢得更多的贸易上的让步是“极为困难”的。
    加利福尼亚大学亚洲研究所的日本问题专家斯埃伦皮诺则推测说，新政府可能是一个软弱的政府而无法采取大胆的行动。因此，他认为要想使日本在贸易、防务、经济政策方面依照美国所希望的那样有所变化是困难的。
    新华社华盛顿４月２６日电　今天《华尔街日报》的一则消息说，美国贸易官员预期，日本首相竹下登的辞职可能会使美国和日本之间的贸易争端更加难以解决。
    消息说，在竹下登任职期间，日本已在贸易问题上对美国作了不少重要的让步。目前，美日之间在贸易问题上仍然存在不少冲突。在美国议会已有人要求把日本列为对美国进行不公平贸易的国家，对日本采取贸易制裁措施。消息认为，在日本政府当前为贪污丑闻困扰的情况下，不可能在贸易问题上再作出一揽子的让步。
