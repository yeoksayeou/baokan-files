Title: One Can Only Do One Thing in a Lifetime

“One can only do one thing in a lifetime.” This phrase, though not a profound truth or a famous saying, is attributed to whom?

It is me.

One day, while chatting with several guests, we discussed how many writers had abandoned their pens to pursue more lucrative business ventures. They asked, “What about you? What do you think?”

I responded with that sentence.

Yes, everyone has their own aspirations. One can only do one thing in a lifetime. Writers who have abandoned their pens may be enviable, but I believe they are also pitiful, for they have acknowledged that they lack the strength to complete the literary endeavor. A person who abandons their original intent, amidst the endless changes and movements of the world, may have the freedom to choose, but their inner self might be in chaos. Of course, there are also those who, from the moment they entered the world, never had any original intent, and only wanted to join the excitement. Now that the excitement is over, they should go elsewhere to find new excitement. Society will never be lively in just one place.

Such people, throughout their lives, never intended to do any one thing well, but only sought to gain from all the things that excited them, without ever considering what they could contribute.

All of this happened “after literature lost its sensational impact.” Without the sensation, it is no longer the focal point of society's excitement. Thus, those who once eagerly discussed *One Hundred Years of Solitude* could not endure even ten years of solitude. The trend has passed, and it is truly “nowhere to express sorrow.” However, those who remain are not the eliminated ones. Just as Marshal Zhu and Marshal Chen experienced after the Nanchang Uprising, those steadfast, true writers who hold fast to their original intentions are like calm snow-capped peaks, calmly overlooking the world. They watch as the snowmelt flows away in the spring without feeling sorrow or loneliness. Instead, they feel lightness and joy.

The snowmelt has its place to go. The snow-capped peaks will not become “impoverished snow.”

There is a snow-capped peak named Bogeda not far from me, and I enjoy gazing at it from afar. It is blue, a hard and textured blue. This unique blue distinguishes it from the blue of the sky, allowing my eyes to clearly see its majestic silhouette towering above the sky. Under the intense and scorching sunlight, it exudes power and radiance, silently breathing, like a great and all-knowing deity.

If you gaze at it with a tranquil mind for a long time, perhaps you will hear its voice, understand its words!

“The clamor of the times has passed, the era of cherishing creation has arrived.”

This voice resonates and permeates deeply within me, seeping into my blood and bones. I am moved, grateful. I say in my heart, “My god, you have seen through me.”

For many years, all the things I have done were actually preparations for doing one thing, so all those things do not count.

For many years, I have rushed east and west, fought battles, seemingly achieving some results, but in reality, I have not even touched the edge of that one thing.

For many years, I have been in the midst of the clamor of the city, with various hawking noises and the deafening sounds of bargaining and shouting. The voice of sincerity is weak; it has not left the lips before being drowned out by the terrifying waves of noise.

I have also been disturbed and had doubts. At such times, I go to a place with an open view, stand alone, and gaze at the Bogeda deity. It seems to be able to heal my soul, for I trust it. Gradually, I calm down. Under its stern and lofty gaze, I reflect on myself, and the turmoil of material desires subsides. I think, Bogeda, how many things have you done in your lifetime? You seem to have done nothing, not even moved a step. The thing you have done in your lifetime is just standing firmly, never collapsing. You overlook people, coldly watching them struggle, live, and die; the gains and losses, wisdom and foolishness of one generation are buried with their bodies, and the next generation begins anew. They are busy and anxious, seemingly having endless things to do, and when they die, when they finally rest, they realize they have done nothing.

?—The flute sounds, time is up.

So people often think: “If only one could live again…”

If you could live again, what would you do?

“Literature!” I say, “If I had the talent.”

But if heaven does not grant me the talent for literature?

“Then I would only be… an honest citizen of China.”

### “一个人一生只能做一件事”

　　“一个人一生只能做一件事”
　　周涛
    “一个人一生只能做一件事。”这句虽非至理也不出名的话是谁说的？
    是我。
    有一天我和几位客人聊天，谈起了不少的作家已经弃了笔，去做能赚钱的生意。他们说，你呢？你怎么看？
    我就回答了这句话。
    是的，人各有志，人一辈子只能做一件事。弃了笔的作家，也许值得羡慕，但我以为未尝不值得怜悯，因为他这样做就已经承认他一生没有力量完成文学这件事。一个放弃了初衷的人，在茫茫人世间，在每日每时的变化和运动中，他有选择的自由，但他的内心说不定是凌乱的。当然还有一些人，他们当初来到世上，就不曾抱有初衷，而只想凑热闹。现在热闹凑完了也就该到别的地方凑新的热闹去了，社会永远不会只在一个地方热闹。
    这种人一生在世，就压根儿没打算去做好任何一件事，而只想在所有能引起他兴奋的事中捞好处，压根儿不想能奉献什么。
    这一切都发生在“文学失去了轰动效应之后”。失去了轰动，它已不再是社会热闹的焦点，于是，热衷于谈论《百年孤独》的人们，忍受不了哪怕只有十年的寂寞，大势已去，真是“无处话凄凉”。但是，剩下的，并非淘汰的。恰似朱老总、陈老总在南昌起义之后带队伍所经历的情状。那些坚韧的、抱业守志初衷不改的真作家们却像冷静的雪峰那样，清醒地俯瞰着世上的一切，他们看着雪水在春天纷纷离去而并不感到忧伤或孤独，相反，他们感到轻松和欢愉。
    雪水自有它该去的地方。雪峰们却并不会因此“贫雪”。
    有一座名叫博格达的雪峰就座落在离我不远的位置，我喜欢远远地凝望它。它是蓝的，一种坚硬有质感的蓝。这种独特的蓝使它和天空的蓝区分开来，使我的肉眼能够看清它高耸于天空傲岸的轮廓。在阳光炽热而强烈的溅射中，它蒸腾着力量和光芒，默然无语，缓缓呼吸，有如一位无所不知的伟大神灵。
    你如果心态宁静地久久凝视着它，兴许会听见它的声音，听懂它的话语呢！
    “喧嚣的大势已去，崇尚创造的时候已经来了。”
    这声音在我心里久久回荡、深深弥漫，一直渗入血液和骨髓。我感动、感激。我心里说，“我的神，你算看透了我了。”
    多年来，我做的所有的事其实都在为做一件事做准备，所以，那些所有的事都不算事。
    多年来，我东突西进、杀伐征战，仿佛有点儿战果，而实际上是我始终没有摸到那件事的边缘。
    多年来，我居于喧嚣的闹市，各种叫卖声嘈杂，起哄和讨价还价的叫声震耳欲聋；真诚的声音是微弱的，它还没有离开口唇就被可怕的声浪淹没得无声无息。
    我也受到过扰乱，产生过疑问。这时候我就来到一个视野空旷的地方，独自凝视那座博格达神。它仿佛能够医治我的灵魂，因为我信任它。渐渐地我就平静下来，在它的那种严峻崇高目光的俯视下，反省自己，物欲的骚动又会平息下去。我想，博格达呀，你一生中究竟做了多少事呢？你仿佛什么也没做，连一步也没挪动过，你一生所做的事不过就是屹立着，永远也不垮下去。你俯视着人们，冷冷地看人们争来斗去，生老病死；一代人的利害智愚随着他们的肉体埋进土里，下一代人又重新开始那老一套。他们忙忙碌碌，终生忧烦，似乎有永远做不完的事，临死，到彻底休息的时候一想，原来什么也没做。
    ?——笛声响了，时间到了。
    所以人们老是想着：“要是能够重活一回多好……”
    重活一回的话，你愿意干什么？
    “干文学！”我说，“假如我有这才能。”
    如果苍天不赋予我文学才能呢？
    “那我只好……当一个问心无愧的中国公民。”
