	“First, rely on policy; second, rely on technology; third, rely on increased investment.” This is a scientific summary of China's agricultural development experience over the past few decades. These three aspects are like the three wheels that drive agricultural development, complementing and supporting each other, none of which can be missing.

	However, relatively speaking, over a considerable period, people have paid more attention to and desired policy and investment more than technology. The application and promotion of agricultural technology have become the weakest link in the “three relies” chain for agricultural development. This imbalance has constrained the healthy development of China's agriculture.

	Countless practices at home and abroad have proven that, under the correct policy environment and with corresponding investment guarantees, technology is a crucial factor in agricultural development. In developed countries like the United States and Japan, 60% to 80% of agricultural growth is attributed to the application of advanced science and technology. Over the past decade, the role of agricultural technology in China's agricultural growth value has increased from 27% to about 40%. Just by promoting the high-yield hybrid rice bred by the famous agricultural expert Yuan Longping, 600 billion kilograms of grain were produced in 12 years, equivalent to the annual food supply for 150 million people. Technology is crucial for the development and progress of modern agriculture; and as the level of agricultural production continues to improve, this role will become increasingly evident.

	Due to reasons such as ideological understanding and material matching, the application and promotion of agricultural technology in China are not ideal. Although research and promotion departments have done a lot of work and achieved significant results, there are still a considerable number of technological achievements that have not been truly promoted, or the promotion speed is slow, making many advanced technological achievements that could and should be converted into productive forces not timely converted. Taking hybrid rice as an example, using this variety, the yield per mu can be increased by at least 50 kilograms, but after 10 years of promotion, the current annual planting area in China is still less than 2 billion mu, less than half of the annual total rice planting area of 4.8 billion mu. Hybrid corn is similar; although it can increase yield by more than 100 kilograms per mu, 80 million mu out of the national 2.8 billion mu of corn are still using ordinary varieties. Another example is the formula fertilization technology, which does not require additional money; changing the traditional fertilization method can reduce the use of chemical fertilizers by 20% to 30% while achieving the same yield. However, the actual promotion area is still not large. These facts indicate that the potential for increased production in agricultural technology is enormous. Technology-driven agriculture is not only a long-term strategy for agricultural development but also an urgent task to break through the current stagnation. As long as we seriously tackle this issue, many advanced technologies with low investment and high returns can quickly play a significant role in agricultural growth.

	China's agriculture is in a transitional period from a product economy to a commodity economy, and agricultural technology promotion work must adapt to this new situation and implement corresponding reforms. Based on existing experiences, the following measures can be referenced by various regions: First, appoint science and technology deputy county and township magistrates. Currently, 730 counties nationwide have appointed science and technology deputy county magistrates, who are specifically responsible for agricultural technology promotion, and the results have been good. Second, on the basis of individual technology contracts, implement large-scale group contracts. Last year, Hebei organized more than 40,000 science and technology personnel to contract 39% of the province's crop area and 52% of the fruit tree area, promoting a total of 2,590 research achievements, with economic benefits reaching 1.19 billion yuan. Third, on the basis of family farming, establish different levels, forms, and specialties of farmer technology organizations centered around rural elites, such as chicken-raising associations, vegetable research societies, and duck cooperative bodies, etc. Through this method, widely mobilize civilian forces to carry out pre-production, in-production, and post-production services, closely linking farmers with the market, production with technology, and promoting the improvement of agricultural technology levels. Fourth, transform rural science and technology promotion stations into service-oriented operating organizations, implementing paid services and combining technology with materials. Relevant departments should, in accordance with the State Council's decision on the specialized operation of agricultural production materials, timely provide the necessary materials for science and technology promotion.

	It can be believed that as long as everyone from top to bottom pays attention to the application and promotion of agricultural technology, technology will definitely make a special contribution to the revitalization of agriculture.

　　科技可以兴农

    “一靠政策，二靠科技，三靠增加投入”。这是对我国几十年农业发展经验的科学概括。三个方面，就像推动农业发展的三只轮子，互补互济，缺一不可。
    但相比之下，在相当一段时间里，人们对政策、投入的重视与渴求程度超过了科技。农业科技的应用与推广工作，成了农业发展“三靠”链条中最薄弱的一环。这种不协调，制约着我国农业的健康发展。
    中外无数实践已经证明，在正确的政策环境中，有相应的投入保证，科技是兴农的重要因素。美、日等发达国家农业增长值中，６０％—８０％得力于先进科学技术的应用。近１０年来，我国农业科技在农业增长值中的作用，也由２７％上升到４０％左右。仅推广著名农业专家袁隆平培育的高产杂交水稻一项，１２年就增产粮食６００多亿公斤，相当于１．５亿人一年的口粮。科技，对现代农业的发展与进步至关重要；而随着农业生产水平的不断提高，这种作用会愈益明显。
    由于思想认识、物资配套等方面的原因，我国农业科技应用与推广状况不够理想。尽管科研、推广部门做了大量工作，也取得了很大成绩，目前仍有相当数量的科技成果没有真正得到推广，或是推广速度缓慢，使很多应当也可能转化为生产力的先进科技成果没能及时得到转化。仍以杂交水稻为例，使用这一品种，水稻亩产至少可增加５０公斤，而推广１０年，我国目前的年种植面积还不到２亿亩，不及年水稻种植总面积４．８亿亩的一半。杂交玉米也是如此，尽管它可使每亩增产上百公斤，但全国２．８亿亩玉米中，仍有８０００万亩用的是一般品种。又如配方施肥技术，不用多花钱，只要改变传统的施肥办法，就可以少用２０％—３０％的化肥而同样增产。但实际推广面也还不大。种种事实表明，农业科技方面的增产潜力非常之大。科技兴农不仅是农业发展的长期战略，而且是突破徘徊的当务之急。只要认真去抓，许多投资少、效益高的先进技术，很快就能在农业增长方面发挥出巨大威力。
    我国农业正处于由产品经济向商品经济转换时期，农业科技推广工作要适应这种新形势，实行相应的改革。从已有的经验看，以下措施可资各地借鉴：一、配备科技副县长、副乡长。现在全国已有７３０个县配备了科技副县长，专门负责农技推广，效果很好。二、在个人单项技术承包的基础上，实行大规模集团承包。去年河北组织４万多名科技人员承包了全省３９％的农作物面积和５２％的果树面积，累计推广科研成果２５９０项，经济效益达１１．９亿元。三、在家庭经营的基础上，以农村能人为核心，建立不同层次、不同形式、不同专业的农民技术组织，像养鸡协会、蔬菜研究会、板鸭联合体，等等。通过这种方式，广泛动员民间力量，开展产前、产中、产后服务，把农户与市场、生产与技术紧密联合起来，促进农业科技水平提高。四、把农村科技推广站办成服务性经营组织，实行有偿服务、技物结合。有关部门应当按照国务院关于农业生产资料专营的决定，为科技推广及时提供必要的物资。
    可以相信，只要从上到下都来重视农业科技的应用与推广工作，科技就一定可以为农业的振兴作出特殊的贡献。
