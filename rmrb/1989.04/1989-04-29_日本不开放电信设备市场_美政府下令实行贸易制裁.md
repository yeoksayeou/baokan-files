Japan Refuses to Open Telecommunications Equipment Market, U.S. Government Orders Trade Sanctions

    Our reporter, Cang Lide, reports from Washington, D.C., April 28: The Bush administration today ordered trade sanctions against Japan for failing to open its domestic telecommunications equipment market to the United States.

    This decision was made by the White House-level Economic Policy Committee and announced by U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills. This is the first time since the Reagan administration imposed retaliatory measures on certain Japanese telecommunications products exported to the U.S. in 1987 that the U.S. has taken trade sanctions against Japan. The U.S. will impose punitive tariffs on similar products such as telephones and radios that Japan refuses to purchase.

    According to a new U.S. trade law, countries that violate telecommunications equipment trade agreements will face "automatic retaliation." Currently, only the U.S. and Japan have such an agreement. Local opinion believes that this sanctions action shows the Bush administration's attempt to continue to pressure Japan.

    Hills' 214-page report released today also lists many "U.S. trade barriers." The report states that if trading partners refuse to stop "unfair" practices against U.S. exporters, the U.S. will take "retaliatory" measures next month. It is believed that some Asian countries and regions will be the first to be affected.

### 日本不开放电信设备市场  美政府下令实行贸易制裁

　　日本不开放电信设备市场  美政府下令实行贸易制裁
    本报华盛顿４月２８日电  记者仓立德报道：布什政府今天以日本未遵守向美国开放本国电信设备市场为由，下令对日本实行贸易制裁。
    这一决定是白宫内阁级经济政策委员会作出的，由美国贸易代表卡拉·希尔斯宣布。这是自１９８７年里根政府下令对日本某些出口美国的电信商品实行报复措施以来，美国首次对日本采取贸易制裁措施。美国将对日本拒绝购买的电话、无线电等类似产品征收惩罚性关税。
    根据美国一项新贸易法，违反有关电信设备贸易协定的国家将遭到“自动报复”，目前只有美日之间达成这种协定。此间舆论认为，这一制裁行动显示布什政府企图对日本继续保持压力。
    希尔斯今天发表的一份２１４页报告还列举了许多美国“外贸障碍”。该报告表示，如有关贸易伙伴拒绝停止对美国出口商的“不公平”作法，美国下月将采取“报复”措施。据认为，亚洲一些国家和地区将首当其冲。
