Our dormitories are located in the heart of Beijing. The newly constructed Wangfu Hotel is right next to our residence, separated only by a wall. For the past three or four months since the hotel opened, various machines have been running non-stop 24 hours a day, producing a great deal of noise. This noise makes it impossible for us to work during the day or sleep at night. Many elderly residents and those suffering from chronic illnesses find it unbearable. Despite being located in the city center, the Wangfu Hotel does not comply with national and Beijing municipal regulations on environmental protection and noise control, disregarding the interests of the residents. We urge the relevant departments of Beijing Municipality to address this issue.

　　饭店噪声严重　居民怎得安宁
    我们的宿舍地处北京市区中心地带，新建的王府饭店与我们的住所仅一墙之隔，饭店营业三四个月来，各种机器２４小时不停地运转，发出很大的噪声，吵得我们白天无法工作，夜间不能休息，一些年纪大和患有慢性病的人不堪其苦。王府饭店建在市中心，竟不遵守国家和北京市有关保护环境、限制噪声标准的规定，置居民利益于不顾。请北京市有关部门过问此事。
