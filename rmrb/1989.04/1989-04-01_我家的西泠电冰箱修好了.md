Your newspaper published my letter titled “‘Warranty’ Should Not Be an Empty Promise” on the sixth page on February 25th. On February 27th, two technicians from the Xiling Refrigerator warranty service center in our city came to my home to repair the refrigerator. In less than an hour, they fixed my refrigerator, which had been broken for over seven months.
