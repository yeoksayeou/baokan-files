Through measures such as limiting the number of visitors, the problem of destructive openings at the Palace Museum is being addressed. However, areas that general visitors cannot see still hide a little-known concern: a complete imperial palace has been divided into 10 separate units, rendering it fragmented. Out of the total building area of 150,000 square meters in the imperial palace, 35,000 square meters are occupied by external units; out of more than 9,000 ancient buildings, 480 are occupied by external units. These units operate independently, turning the former imperial forbidden area into a large courtyard today, with various hidden dangers threatening the safety of the Palace Museum.

The Wuying Hall and Wenhua Hall, two famous large palaces in the Forbidden City located on either side of the Taihe Gate, are now used as offices by the China International Exhibition Company and the China International Friendship Publishing Company, respectively. The left and right side halls and the two side gates of the latter are occupied by the China International Exhibition Company. The world-renowned Yanchi Tower of the Meridian Gate is used as a warehouse by the China National Cultural Relics Import and Export Corporation. Under the right side gate of the Meridian Gate, there are several rusty cannons covered in dust, stored by the Beijing Museum of History. Additionally, the Nanxun Hall, which was once used to enshrine portraits of past emperors, the Baoyun Building, China's first large-scale specialized cultural relics warehouse built in 1914, the western wing of the Cining Palace where the empress dowagers resided, and the southern hall of the Taihe Gate are all used as warehouses by the Chinese Revolution Museum, the Cultural Relics Publishing House, the China National Cultural Relics Import and Export Corporation, and the Xu Beihong Memorial Hall, respectively.

The greatest and most dangerous enemy of the Forbidden City is fire. However, the reporter saw that near the Xihua Gate, there are cables and wooden materials scattered around, with cars entering and exiting; inside the western wall of the Forbidden City, a large amount of wooden materials are piled up; outside the wall, there are boiler rooms, workshops, and storage sheds, with oil drums and gas cylinders stored in the open, and the chimneys of the kitchen are higher than the city wall, constantly spewing out thick smoke and sparks!

This "feudal warlord" situation directly affects the general survey, management, protection, and repair of ancient buildings. For the safety of the Forbidden City and the image and reputation of our ancient civilization, changing this situation is urgent.

### 紫禁城的“诸侯割据”

　　紫禁城的“诸侯割据”
    通过限制参观人数等措施，故宫博物院破坏性开放的问题正在得到解决。然而，一般参观者所见不到的地方，还隐藏着一个鲜为人知的忧患：一个完整的皇家宫院，已被１０个单位分割得支离破碎，总建筑面积１５万平方米的皇宫，被外单位占据着３．５万平方米；９０００余间古建筑，外单位占据着４８０余间。这些单位各自为政，昔日的宫廷禁地，今日已经成了一个大杂院，各种隐患威胁着故宫的安全。
    分踞太和门左右的武英殿和文华殿，是故宫里两座著名的大型宫殿。如今前者是出国文物展览公司的办公处，后者的左右配殿和两侧门洞被国际友谊馆占用。举世闻名的午门燕翅楼，是文物总店的库房，午门下右掖门锁着历史博物馆存放的几只尘土覆盖着的破炮筒子。此外，曾用来供奉历代帝王画像的南熏殿，建于１９１４年的我国第一座专用大型文物库房宝蕴楼，皇太后们起居的慈宁宫西府，太和门南朝房等处，分别被革命博物馆、文物出版社、文物总店、徐悲鸿纪念馆等辟为仓库。
    故宫，最大的、也是最危险的敌人，莫过于火。可是记者看到：西华门附近电缆环绕，木料杂陈，汽车出入；故宫西墙内，堆放着大量的木料；墙外，是锅炉房、车间、料库，露天存放着油桶、气罐，伙房的烟囱高过城墙，时时喷吐着浓烟和火星！
    这种“诸侯割据”的状况直接影响着古建筑的普查、管理、保护和维修。为了紫禁城的安全，为了我文明古国的形象与声誉，改变这种状况已是刻不容缓了。
