A recent report indicates that the owner of a hotel and casino in Las Vegas, USA, has been fined $1.5 million. The reason for this penalty is that he organized a celebration for Hitler's birthday.

The decision was made by the Nevada Gaming Control Board. This body typically imposes fines only on gambling-related fraudulent activities. This time, however, the casino and hotel owner, Ralph Ingersoll, was penalized for praising Hitler and the Third Reich at his Royal Inn Hotel and Casino. The board deemed this behavior detrimental to Nevada's reputation.

Last year, local newspapers in Las Vegas reported that Ingersoll had a secret room containing wall paintings of Hitler and a portrait of Ingersoll in a Nazi uniform. He also held parties to celebrate Hitler's birthday in 1986 and 1988. Additionally, he owned cars that were used by German and Japanese fascist leaders during World War II.

Ingersoll denied sympathizing with the Nazis but accepted the fine and promised not to hold such events in the future.

Nevada is the site of U.S. nuclear weapons testing and is known for legalized gambling and prostitution. The federal government is considering building a nuclear waste disposal site in the state. One columnist noted that the state's reputation is not very good. However, even in such a place, there is no room for fascism.

### 公然颂扬希特勒  赌场老板被罚款

　　公然颂扬希特勒  赌场老板被罚款
    本报讯  据报道，最近美国赌城拉斯维加斯一家饭店和赌场的老板被课以１５０万美元的罚款，罪名是他举办了庆祝希特勒生日的聚会。
    作出这一决定的是内华达州的赌博管制委员会。这个机构通常只对与赌博有关的舞弊行为课以罚款，而这回却是因为赌场和饭店的老板拉尔夫·英格尔斯塔德在他的皇宫饭店和赌场里颂扬希特勒和第三帝国，该机构认为这有损于内华达州的声誉。
    去年，拉斯维加斯的地方报纸曾报道，英格尔斯塔德有间密室，内藏希特勒的壁画和英格尔斯塔德身穿纳粹军服的油画。他并为庆祝希特勒的生日在１９８６年和１９８８年举行过聚会，他还拥有二次大战期间德国和日本法西斯头子用过的轿车。
    英格尔斯塔德否认他同情纳粹，但表示接受罚款的决定并保证不再举行此类的聚会。
    内华达州是美国核武器试验地，赌博和卖淫是合法的。联邦政府正在考虑要在该州修建核废料埋藏地。有位专栏作者指出，这个州的声誉本来就不怎么好。不过，在这么一个地方，法西斯也无藏身之地。
