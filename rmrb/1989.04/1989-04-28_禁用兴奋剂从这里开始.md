The use of performance-enhancing drugs in sports originated in Europe, but it was also in Europe where the first efforts to combat these substances began. In 1963, the European Parliament's Committee on Education and Culture conducted a special investigation into students' drug abuse, which included the issue of using performance-enhancing drugs in sports. This drew the attention of the International Olympic Committee, which studied the issue at its 1964 Tokyo conference.

France was the first to take action against performance-enhancing drugs. On June 1, 1965, France's Law No. 65-412 declared that athletes found to have used banned substances would face penalties, including imprisonment for one month to one year and fines ranging from 500 to 5,000 francs. The law also stipulated that drug tests must be conducted by doctors appointed or approved by the National Youth and Sports Department. The following year, France specified the types of banned substances. Almost every year, new types of drugs were added to the list of banned substances, and penalties became increasingly severe. The maximum prison sentence was increased to five years, and offenders could be banned from competing for life.

Other Western European countries followed suit in the late 1960s and early 1970s, enacting relevant laws and regulations. Among them, Italy was recognized as a model in the fight against performance-enhancing drugs. In 1971, Italy issued an order prohibiting the use of drugs to enhance athletic performance. Subsequently, a performance-enhancing drug laboratory was established at a sports medicine research institute in Rome to assist with drug testing.

　　禁用兴奋剂从这里开始
    体育比赛中使用兴奋剂源于欧洲，然而，最先同兴奋剂作斗争的也是欧洲。１９６３年，欧洲议会所属的课外教育委员会专门组织对学生吸毒现象的调查，涉及在体育比赛中使用兴奋剂的问题，引起国际奥委会重视，并在第二年东京代表大会上研究这一问题。
    法国同兴奋剂的斗争开始得最早。１９６５年６月１日，法国６５—４１２号法令宣布，对违禁服用药物的运动员予以制裁，监禁一个月至一年，罚款５００至５０００法郎。法令还规定药检必须有国家青年和体育部委派或认可的医生参加。转年，法国规定了禁服药物的种类。以后几乎每年都有新的药物种类被列入禁用范围。惩罚措施也越来越严厉。监禁期增至最多五年，可判罚服禁药者终生不得参加比赛。
    西欧其它国家在六十年代末七十年代初也相继制定了有关法律条文。其中，意大利被公认为同兴奋剂作斗争的典范。１９７１年，意大利公布了禁止借用药物力量提高运动成绩的法令。随后，又在罗马一家体育医学研究所建立起兴奋剂实验室，对药检工作提供帮助。
