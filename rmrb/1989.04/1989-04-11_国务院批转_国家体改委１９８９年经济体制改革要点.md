Edition: 5

The State Council recently endorsed the State Commission for Economic System Reform's "1989 Economic System Reform Points," requiring all regions and departments to earnestly implement the policies and guidelines of the Thirteenth Party Congress and the Third Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee. They must closely integrate deepening reforms with rectifying the economic environment and order, timely summarize experiences, study new situations and problems arising from reforms and development, and push forward various supporting reforms in an orderly manner.

The State Commission for Economic System Reform reviewed the progress of economic system reforms in 1988, analyzed existing problems, and made arrangements for 1989. The guiding principles for 1989 economic system reforms proposed by the State Commission for Economic System Reform are: closely centering on rectifying the economic environment and order, focusing on developing and perfecting the various reform measures that have been introduced, and utilizing the favorable opportunities of rectification and order to actively and steadily conduct deep-layered reform experiments and explorations. Each reform must be beneficial to controlling investment and consumption demands, eliminating economic overheating, and suppressing inflation; beneficial to the rational adjustment of industrial structures, improving economic efficiency, and increasing effective supply; and beneficial to promoting the transformation of economic mechanisms and gradually establishing a new order for socialist commodity economy.

The main contents of the 1989 reforms are: further perfecting and developing the enterprise contract responsibility system, emphasizing the strengthening of enterprise competition mechanisms, risk mechanisms, and self-discipline mechanisms; actively exploring new ways and means of macro-control during the transition period of the system, emphasizing structural adjustment while implementing total quantity control; establishing market rules, strengthening supervision and management, and promoting market development; and conscientiously doing the basic work of reforms.

All levels of economic system reform departments must closely cooperate with relevant departments to ensure the implementation of a series of reform measures issued by the Party Central Committee and the State Council. They must focus on a few major special reforms, conduct pilot projects in a few cities or enterprises, and achieve tangible results.

The specific arrangements for the 1989 economic system reforms are as follows:

I. Deepening Enterprise Reforms and Improving Economic Efficiency as the Primary Task

1. Perfecting and Developing the Enterprise Contract Responsibility System. Strictly implement the "Law of the People's Republic of China on Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People," the "Provisional Regulations on the Bankruptcy Law of the People's Republic of China" (trial), and the "Provisional Regulations on the Contract Responsibility System for Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People." Newly contracted enterprises and those that need to re-sign contracts must introduce competition mechanisms and implement public bidding to select the best operators and contract plans. Actively promote full-staff risk mortgage contracting, where the mortgage money is used to compensate for enterprise losses. Break through regional, departmental, and ownership boundaries to promote enterprise contracting of enterprises.

The enterprise contract should include requirements for technological progress. A set of indicators for evaluating enterprise technological progress should be researched and developed and included in the contract.

2. Deepening Internal Supporting Reforms of Enterprises. Enterprises have the right to decide on their organizational structure based on their own characteristics. Internal management personnel at all levels should implement competitive selection and appointment. Gradually promote the optimization of labor combinations, and the placement of surplus personnel should currently be mainly resolved within the enterprise.

Establish and improve labor quotas, clearly define powers and responsibilities at all levels. The form of internal wages and bonus distribution methods should be determined by the enterprise itself under the premise of implementing national income distribution policies.

Strengthen economic accounting, strictly enforce financial discipline and supervision. Enterprises with conditions should establish internal banks, strictly implement cost regulations, and vigorously reduce business expenses and collective purchasing power. Strictly control bonuses and the issuance of goods.

3. Actively Promote Enterprise Mergers. Mergers should be carried out in the process of competition, adhering to the principle of paid transfer of property rights, and the assets of the merged enterprise must be carefully evaluated. Cities with conditions should establish specialized organizations for asset evaluation and actively develop the property rights transfer market. Enterprise mergers must focus on results, with the optimization of industrial structure, product structure, and enterprise organizational structure as the criteria.

4. Focus on Cultivating and Developing a Number of Large Enterprise Groups. According to the requirements of industrial policies, select a number of key enterprise groups, implement comprehensive contracting, and list them separately in the national plan, allowing them to operate freely and become the backbone of economic development and foreign trade.

5. Gradually Implement the Shareholding System with Public Ownership as the Mainstay. In 1989, the main focus will be on implementing the shareholding system within enterprises and among enterprises. Select a few large and medium-sized enterprises that meet the requirements of industrial policies, have good operating conditions, and have relatively sound internal management to conduct pilot projects for public issuance of shares. Newly built and expanded enterprises, enterprises formed by mergers, and enterprise groups can implement the shareholding system. All shareholding enterprises must adhere to the principles of equal shareholding, equal profits, shared benefits, and shared risks, and strictly prohibit the erosion of state-owned assets and the expansion of personal distribution. Quickly promulgate the interim measures and relevant regulations for the trial implementation of the shareholding system in state-owned enterprises, and gradually improve and perfect the existing shareholding enterprises based on this.

Actively prepare for the sale of part of the assets of large state-owned enterprises and the implementation of debt-to-equity swaps to promote the deepening of enterprise reforms. Formulate relevant regulations, select a batch of enterprises for preliminary asset evaluation, and prepare for the issuance of shares, striving to implement them in 1990.

6. Plan and Gradually Auction Small Enterprises. In principle, all state-owned small enterprises can be auctioned. In 1989, priority will be given to auctioning those enterprises that have been operating at a loss or with minimal profits for many years due to poor management, or those that should be auctioned according to the requirements of optimization. Establish auction organizations with representatives from all relevant parties, carefully conduct asset verification, reasonably determine the reserve price, and implement public auctions. Auction proceeds, after allocating a portion to the social insurance fund, will be transferred to the same-level state-owned asset management department. The use of this portion of the income should also be regulated, and it is strictly prohibited to convert it into consumption funds.

II. Gradually Establishing a Macro-Control System Favorable to Total Quantity Balance and Structural Optimization

7. Adhere to the System of Balancing the Total Quantity of the National Economy. The arrangement of production and construction plans should cover all economic activities in society. Based on the actual financial and material capabilities, determine the growth of investment and consumption funds, and strive to achieve a balance in fiscal revenue and expenditure, credit revenue and expenditure, international balance of payments, and the scale of important investment goods and investment, and the supply of goods and social purchasing power, gradually forming a comprehensive balance mechanism for the total quantity of the macro-economy.

Improve the investment management system. Both budgetary and extra-budgetary investments should be included in the plans at all levels for comprehensive balancing, and adjusted according to industrial policies using taxation, credit, and necessary administrative measures. Different management methods should be adopted for the investment activities of all economic components, including state-owned, collective, individual, and other economic entities. Expand the scope of bidding for construction projects and strictly implement contracts.

The existing state professional investment companies should truly achieve separation of government and enterprise and gradually develop towards state holding companies. In terms of fund use, the proportion of equity participation and interest subsidies should be increased to fully play the role of guiding investment.

8. According to the requirements of gradually reducing the number of indicative plan indicators and establishing a commodity classification management system, adjust the scope and authority of unified allocation and distribution of commodities and materials, and expand the market for production materials. In 1989, the number of commodities managed by the State Planning Commission and the indicative plan materials balanced by various departments will be reduced.

For the exclusive operation of a few commodities determined by the State Council, follow-up monitoring should be strengthened, problems should be solved in a timely manner, and their smooth implementation should be ensured. Local governments at all levels are not allowed to increase the number of exclusive commodities.

9. Strengthen the independent implementation of monetary policy and credit policy by the central bank, and quickly establish a system for the separate management of commercial loans and policy loans. The central bank implements vertical leadership.

Gradually transfer the special loans currently undertaken by the central bank to specialized banks. Appropriately raise the rediscount rate of the central bank and the loan interest rate of specialized banks. Improve the deposit reserve system, and regulate different reserve ratios based on different sources of deposits. At an appropriate time, raise the deposit reserve ratio. Before raising the reserve ratio, the deposit reserve ratio can be adjusted by raising the deposit reserve ratio. At the same time, increase the special deposits of non-bank institutions in the central bank and include their loans in the credit balance plan. Establish a settlement center to handle the settlement business between financial institutions.

Specialized banks gradually implement enterprise management. In 1989, the Agricultural Bank of China will continue to improve the contract system based on summarizing experiences. Other specialized banks should establish and improve various management responsibility systems and do a good job in the basic work of enterprise management.

10. Further Improve the Financial and Tax Management System. Both the central and local governments should try to compile consolidated budgets. Provincial tax authorities should be under the dual leadership of the central and local governments, with the central government as the main leader; the main leaders should be nominated by the State Taxation Administration and appointed by the Ministry of Personnel after review. Tax authorities below the provincial level should be under the vertical leadership of the province. Revise and improve the tax collection and administration regulations, and strengthen tax collection and administration work.

Start researching the gradual transition from pre-tax debt repayment to post-tax debt repayment, and do a good job in the pilot work. Continue to do a good job in the pilot work of reducing income tax, tax and profit separation, post-tax debt repayment, and post-tax contracting in cities such as Chongqing and Shanghai.

11. Implement a differentiated credit policy and tax policy to support the strong and restrict the weak, and promote the rational adjustment of industrial structures. For enterprises that need support, continue to give appropriate tax and loan concessions. If they are temporarily unable to pay interest due to the increase in loan interest rates, after strict examination and approval by the bank and the planning department, they can adopt the form of "transitional loans," that is, the increased interest rate part is not repaid for the time being and is transferred to the principal of the next period's loan. For general processing industries, try to reduce tax exemptions and concessions as much as possible and impose necessary restrictions on loans.

Gradually change the construction tax to an investment tax, levied based on the investment amount of the construction project, and implement differentiated tax rates according to industrial policies, with the highest rate reaching 100%.

III. Suppressing and Guiding Consumption, Alleviating Income Inequality, and Promoting the Transformation of the Distribution Mechanism

12. Further Improve the Existing Method of Linking Enterprise Wage Bills with Performance. Adhere to the principle that the actual income growth of employees should be lower than the growth of labor productivity. Most enterprises should increase a labor productivity index calculated at constant prices when linking wage bills with performance. Enterprises with conditions should actively promote the linkage of wage bills with physical quantities. Research should be conducted on methods such as linking enterprise wage bills with the capital profit rate and wage profit rate of the industry, and pilot work can be conducted in one or two cities.

13. Use tax measures to adjust personal income distribution. For various types of income outside of wages, adopt the methods of classified taxation, one-time collection, and tax withholding. All regulations for reducing or exempting bonus taxes and wage adjustment taxes that have not been approved by the State Council or the Ministry of Finance will be stopped. In 1989, pilot work will be conducted in a few large and medium-sized cities to establish a personal income declaration system in party and government organs and some high-income industries. To strengthen the tax collection and administration of individual industrial and commercial households and private enterprises, the "reward ticket" method can be piloted in a few cities.

14. Adjust the consumption structure and guide the diversion of purchasing power. Raise the interest rate on savings deposits and increase the withdrawal of currency. For this purpose, a new price index needs to be established, which will start from December 1989 and be compared month-on-month as a basis for adjusting interest rates and savings preservation.

Encourage residents to purchase bonds and stocks. Vigorously promote the commercialization of housing, and sell public housing in batches. Strictly prohibit lowering the price of public housing and privatizing it in disguise. Develop housing savings business. Impose a special consumption tax on some high-end consumer goods. Strictly follow the State Council's regulations to control and reduce social collective purchasing power.

15. Accelerate the reform of the social insurance system. While continuing to improve the unified old-age insurance system for employees of state-owned enterprises, select a few cities to conduct pilot reforms of the old-age insurance system where employees and individual and agricultural households mainly pay insurance fees themselves; conduct pilot reforms of the medical insurance system in cities such as Dandong, Siping, Huangshi, and Zhuzhou; select a few cities to conduct pilot work on establishing an unemployment insurance system. Conduct comprehensive pilot reforms of the social security system in Shenzhen and Hainan.

Establish a national leading group for the reform of the social insurance system to plan, coordinate, and promote this major reform.

IV. Rectifying Market Order and Promoting Market Development

16. Continue to focus on the work of cleaning up and rectifying companies. Except for a very few companies authorized by the State Council, all other companies must be decoupled from government departments and must not have the power to allocate materials, approve investment projects, and engage in foreign economic and trade activities. They should no longer bear administrative management responsibilities and should become true enterprises. Strictly implement the central government's regulations that party and government officials at all levels and retired cadres should not hold concurrent positions in companies or serve in companies managed by their original units. All types of companies must strictly implement the state's income distribution and adjustment policies.

Quickly promulgate the company regulations. All companies must re-register and strictly implement the approval system for company establishment. All types of companies must operate within the scope of business approved by the state, pay taxes according to regulations, and strictly prohibit speculation and profiteering.

17. Rectify various wholesale enterprises and improve market organizations. All wholesale enterprises must be re-examined and registered, and their business scope must be determined.

In cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin, pilot cross-regional wholesale enterprise groups or comprehensive trading companies. In cities such as Zhengzhou, Wuhan, and Jilin, pilot agricultural futures markets. Select a few regions to pilot regional common markets. In several central cities, pilot auction markets and carry out various public property auction businesses. Quickly revise the public property disposal management regulations, and all types of public property that need to be disposed of must be sold by auction and not sold at a low price in private.

18. Vigorously promote the openness and voucherization of transactions. Except for the part managed by contracts, all self-sold production materials by enterprises should enter the transaction market, and off-market transactions are prohibited. Universal commercial credit voucherization should be implemented to change the practice of enterprises owing each other. The tax and industrial and commercial administration departments should strictly examine the accounting situation of operators, and those who do not establish accounts or establish accounts that do not meet the standards should be required to establish qualified business accounts within a limited time, otherwise, they will be fined or have their business licenses revoked.

19. Strictly control price increases and gradually establish a classified price management system. No place, department, or enterprise is allowed to arbitrarily raise the prices of production materials and consumer goods directly managed by the state, as well as service charges. For production materials and important consumer goods outside the plan, those with the highest price limit set by the state must be strictly enforced. For commodities that have been liberalized, market prices continue to be implemented, but for a very few commodities whose prices need to be adjusted, an application system must be implemented, and the specific scope will be determined by the price department. Imported goods sold domestically must also comply with relevant price management regulations. Rectify the charging methods and standards of the medical and educational sectors.

20. Establish and improve a market supervision system jointly composed of relevant government departments, publicity units, and civic organizations. Relevant government departments should clearly define responsibilities, coordinate and cooperate, strengthen market supervision, combat illegal transactions, and solve the problem of supervisors being supervised. Pay attention to the role of consumer associations and other civic organizations in participating in market supervision and management. Continue to implement the reporting system, strictly enforce the various market regulations that have been promulgated, and quickly formulate relevant regulations such as the Anti-Monopoly Law and the Anti-Unfair Trade Practices Law.

V. Strengthening the Research and Formulation of Mid-Term Reform Plans, and Continuing to Focus on Comprehensive Reform Pilots

21. In conjunction with the formulation of the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" for national economic and social development, the State Commission for Economic System Reform will organize social forces to, based on summarizing ten years of reform experience and conducting in-depth investigations into major issues in the system, jointly research and formulate the economic system reform plan for the "Eighth Five-Year Plan," striving to concretize the goals, tasks, and steps of the reform to play its guiding role in deepening the reform. All regions and relevant departments should also, in conjunction with the actual situation and the "Eighth Five-Year Plan," research and formulate mid-term reform plans for their respective regions and departments.

Local economic system reform departments should enter the government sequence, strengthen their forces, improve the quality of their cadres, and improve their work style. The comrades in the economic system reform departments must strengthen their learning, go deep into practice, conduct investigations and research, and closely cooperate with the State Planning Commission and other economic management departments, strengthen horizontal and vertical information exchange, timely study new problems arising from the reform, and propose specific and feasible countermeasures and suggestions.

22. Continue to focus on comprehensive and special reform pilot work. Summarize the experiences of the reform and opening-up experimental zones in Guangdong, Fujian, and Hainan, and a few representative comprehensive reform pilot cities, study new situations and problems, and propose new requirements for further improving the pilots. Actively promote special reform pilots in areas such as property rights system, tax and profit separation, market organization, government institutions, housing commercialization, and the establishment of a social security system, and do a good job in preparing for promotion on a larger scale.

    国务院最近批转了国家体改委提出的《１９８９年经济体制改革要点》，要求各地区、各部门要认真贯彻执行党的十三大和十三届三中全会的方针、政策，把深化改革和治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序紧密结合起来，及时总结经验，研究改革和发展中出现的新情况、新问题，有领导、有秩序地推进各项配套改革。
    国家体改委在《１９８９年经济体制改革要点》中回顾了１９８８年经济体制改革的进展情况，分析了存在的问题，对１９８９年的经济体制改革作了安排。国家体改委提出的１９８９年经济体制改革的指导原则是：紧紧围绕治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序这个中心，把深化改革的重点放在发展、完善已经出台的各项改革措施上，同时要利用治理整顿的有利时机，积极稳妥地进行深层改革的试验和探索。每项改革都要有利于控制投资需求和消费需求，消除经济过热，抑制通货膨胀；有利于产业结构的合理调整，提高经济效益、增加有效供给；有利于促进经济机制的转换，逐步建立社会主义商品经济新秩序。
    １９８９年改革的主要内容是：进一步完善和发展企业承包经营责任制，着重强化企业的竞争机制、风险机制和自我约束机制；积极探索体制转换时期宏观调控的新方式、新手段，在实行总量控制的同时，突出结构调整；建立市场规则，加强监督管理，促进市场发育；认真做好改革的各项基础性工作。
    各级体改部门要同各有关部门密切配合，抓好党中央、国务院已发布的一系列改革措施的贯彻落实。深入下去抓住几项重大的专项改革，在少数城市或企业进行试点，切实抓出成效。
    １９８９年经济体制改革的具体安排是：
　一、把深化企业改革、提高经济效益作为首要任务。
    １、完善和发展企业承包经营责任制。认真贯彻实施《中华人民共和国全民所有制工业企业法》、《中华人民共和国企业破产法》（试行）和《全民所有制工业企业承包经营责任制暂行条例》，坚决履行承包合同。新承包的企业和需要重新签订承包合同的企业，都要引入竞争机制，实行公开招标，优选经营者和承包方案。积极推行全员风险抵押承包，企业亏损时，应用抵押金补偿。打破地区、部门和所有制界限，推进企业承包企业。
    企业承包合同中应包含科技进步的要求。要研究制定一套考核企业科技进步的指标，纳入承包合同。
    ２、深化企业内部配套改革。企业有权根据自己的特点决定机构设置。厂内各级管理人员应实行竞争上岗、择优选任。稳步推行优化劳动组合，富余人员的安置，目前主要靠厂内消化。
    建立健全劳动定额，层层明确权力和责任。企业内部工资形式和奖金分配办法，在执行国家收入分配政策的前提下，由企业自主确定。
    加强经济核算，严肃财务纪律和财务监督。有条件的企业都要建立厂内银行，严格执行成本条例，大力压缩营业外开支和集团购买力，从严控制奖金和实物发放。
    ３、积极推进企业兼并。兼并应在竞争过程中进行，坚持产权有偿转让原则，对被兼并企业的资产必须认真评估。有条件的城市，要筹建专门从事资产评估的组织，并积极开拓产权转让市场。企业兼并必须注重实效，以优化产业结构、产品结构和企业组织结构作为衡量标准。
    ４、重点扶植和培育若干大型企业集团。根据产业政策的要求，选定若干重点企业集团，实行总承包，在国家计划中单列，放开经营，使其成为发展经济和对外贸易的骨干力量。
    ５、稳步试行以公有制为主的股份制。１９８９年主要试行由企业内部职工购买股票和企业之间相互参股的股份制。选择少数符合产业政策要求、经营状况较好、内部管理较为健全的大中型企业进行公开发行股票的试点。有条件的新建扩建企业、由兼并组成的企业和企业集团，可实行股份制的组织形式。所有股份制企业必须坚持股权平等、同股同利、利益分享、风险共担的原则，严禁侵蚀国有资产和变相扩大个人分配。尽快颁行国有企业试行股份制的暂行办法和有关法规，并据此对现有股份制企业逐步进行改造和完善。
    积极做好出售部分国有大企业资产、实行债务股票化的准备，促进企业改革的深化。制定有关法规，选定一批企业先行评估资产并做好股票发行的准备工作，争取１９９０年得以实施。
    ６、有计划、有步骤地拍卖小企业。国有小企业原则上都可以拍卖。１９８９年优先拍卖那些因经营不善连年亏损或微利的企业、按优化结构要求应该拍卖的企业。要建立各有关方面的代表参加的拍卖组织，认真清产核资，合理确定底价，实行公开拍卖。拍卖收入除部分划为社会保险基金外，其余归同级国有资产管理部门，对这部分收入的使用也应作出必要的规定，严禁将其转化为消费基金。
　二、逐步建立有利于总量平衡和结构优化的宏观调控体系。
    ７、坚持国民经济总量平衡制度。生产和建设计划的安排应覆盖全社会的经济活动。要按照财力、物力的实际可能，确定投资和消费基金的增长，力争实现财政收支、信贷收支、国际收支以及重要投资品与投资规模、商品可供量与社会购买力的平衡，逐步形成宏观经济总量的综合平衡机制。
    改进投资管理制度。预算内、预算外投资都要纳入各级计划，进行综合平衡，并依据产业政策，以税收、信贷及必要的行政手段进行调控。对全民、集体、个体和其他经济成分的投资主体的投资活动，采取不同的管理方式。扩大基建项目招标的范围，严格履行合同。
    现有的国家专业投资公司要真正实现政企分离，逐步向国家控股公司的方向发展。在资金使用上，应增加参股和贴息的比重，充分发挥引导投资的作用。
    ８、按照逐步减少指令性计划指标，建立商品分类管理体制的要求，调整商品和物资统一分配调拨的范围与权限，扩大生产资料市场。１９８９年，国家计委管理的商品和负责平衡的统配物资，以及各部门管理的指令性计划物资品种，都将有所减少。
    对国务院确定的几种商品的专营，要加强跟踪监测，及时解决发生的问题，保证其顺利实施。各级地方政府均无权增加专营商品的品种。
    ９、加强中央银行独立执行货币政策和信贷政策的职能，尽快建立商业性贷款与政策性贷款分别管理的制度。中央银行实行垂直领导。
    将目前中央银行所承担的专项贷款逐步转给专业银行。适当提高中央银行的再贷款利率和专业银行的贷款利率。改进存款准备金制度，按不同存款来源规定不同的准备金率，并选择适当时机提高存款准备金率。在提高准备金率以前，可用提高存款备付金率的办法进行调控。同时，增加非银行机构在中央银行的特种存款，并将其贷款纳入信贷平衡计划。建立清算中心，承担金融机构之间的清算业务。
    专业银行逐步实行企业化经营。１９８９年，农业银行要在总结经验的基础上，继续完善承包制。其他专业银行要建立和完善各种经营责任制，做好企业化经营的各项基础工作。
    １０、进一步改进财税管理体制。中央和地方都要试编复式预算。省级税务机构，实行中央与地方政府双重领导，以中央领导为主；主要负责人，由国家税务局提名，人事部审核任命。省以下的税务机构由省垂直领导。修改和完善税收征管条例，强化税收征管工作。
    着手研究逐步将企业税前还贷改为税后还贷的办法，并抓好试点。在重庆、上海等城市继续搞好降低所得税、税利分流、税后还贷、税后承包的试点。
    １１、实行区别对待、扶优限劣的信贷政策与财税政策，促进产业结构的合理调整。对需要扶植的企业，在税收、贷款上继续给予适当优惠。如因提高贷款利率而暂时无力付息，经银行和计划部门严格审定，可采取“过渡贷款”的形式，即提高利率部分暂不归还，将其转入下期贷款本金。对一般加工工业，尽量减少减免税照顾，并在贷款上予以必要的限制。
    逐步将建筑税改为投资税，按建设项目投资额征收，并根据产业政策实行差别税率，最高档可达１００％。
　三、抑制和引导消费，缓解分配不公，促进分配机制转换。
    １２、进一步完善现有的企业工资总额与效益挂钩的办法。坚持职工实际收入的增长低于劳动生产率增长的原则。多数企业工资总额与效益挂钩应增加一个按不变价格计算的劳动生产率指标。有条件的企业，积极推广工资总额与实物量挂钩。要着手研究企业工资总额与行业的资金利润率和工资利润率挂钩等办法，并可选择一、两个城市进行试点。
    １３、运用税收手段，调节个人收入分配。对工资外各类收入采取分类设税、一次征收和实行税款代扣的办法。未经国务院或财政部批准，各地区、各部门自行减免奖金税、工资调节税的各种规定一律停止执行。１９８９年在少数大中城市的党政机关和部分高收入的行业，进行建立个人收入申报制度的试点。为加强对个体工商户、私人企业的税收征管，可选择几个城市试行“有奖发票”办法。
    １４、调整消费结构，引导购买力分流。提高储蓄存款利率，增加货币回笼。为此需要增设一种新的物价指数，即从１９８９年１２月份开始，按月环比，作为调整利率和储蓄保值的依据。
    鼓励居民购买债券、股票。大力推进住房商品化，分期分批出售公房。严禁压低公房售价，变相化公为私。开展住房储蓄业务。对某些高档消费品开征特别消费税。坚决按照国务院的规定，压缩和控制社会集团购买力。
    １５、加快社会保险制度的改革。在继续完善全民所有制单位职工养老保险统筹办法的同时，选择少数城市进行职工交纳部分保险费、个体户和农民主要由个人交纳保险费的养老保险制度改革试点；在丹东、四平、黄石、株洲进行医疗保险制度改革试点；选择少数城市开展建立失业保险制度的试点。在深圳、海南进行社会保障制度综合改革试点。
    成立全国社会保险制度改革的领导机构，负责规划、协调和推动这项重大改革。
　四、整顿市场秩序，促进市场发育。
    １６、继续抓紧抓好清理整顿公司的工作。除国务院授权的极少数公司外，其他所有公司都必须同政府部门脱钩，不得兼有调拨物资、审批投资项目和外经外贸等方面的权力，也不再承担行政管理职责，要办成真正的企业。坚决贯彻执行中央关于党政军机关工作人员不得在公司兼职、离退休干部不得在其原单位管理的公司任职的规定。各类公司必须严格执行国家的收入分配和调节政策。
    尽快颁布公司条例。所有公司都要重新登记注册，严格公司成立的审批制度。各类公司必须按照规定的经营范围依法经营、照章纳税，严禁倒买倒卖，牟取暴利。
    １７、整顿各类批发企业，改进市场组织。所有批发企业必须重新审查登记，核定经营范围。
    在上海、天津等地试办跨地区的批发企业集团或综合商社。在郑州、武汉、吉林等地试办农产品期货市场。选择少数地区试办区域性共同市场。在若干中心城市试办拍卖市场，开展各类公物的拍卖业务。抓紧修订公物处置管理条例，各类需要处理的公物，必须拍卖出售，不得私下贱价处理。
    １８、大力推行交易的公开化、票据化。企业自销的生产资料，除纳入合同管理的部分外，都应进入交易市场，禁止场外交易。普遍实行商业信用票据化，改变企业之间拖欠挂帐的做法。税务、工商管理部门要严格审查经营者的建帐状况，对不建帐或建帐不合标准者，限期建立合格的营业帐簿，否则处以罚款或吊销其营业执照。
    １９、严格控制物价上涨，逐步建立分类价格管理制度。任何地方、部门和企业都不得擅自提高国家直接管理的生产资料、消费品价格及劳务收费。计划外生产资料和重要消费品凡国家规定最高限价的，必须严格执行。凡已放开的商品，继续实行市场价格，但其中极少数商品调价，须实行申报制度，具体范围由物价部门确定。进口商品在国内销售，也要遵守有关的物价管理规定。整顿医疗、教育部门的收费办法、收费标准。
    ２０、建立健全由政府有关部门、舆论宣传单位、民间组织共同组成的市场监督体系。政府有关部门要划清职责，协调配合，加强市场监督，打击违法交易，并要解决监督者接受监督的问题。注意发挥消费者协会等民间组织参与市场监督管理的作用。继续实行举报制度，严肃已颁布的各项市场法规，并抓紧制定反垄断法、反不正当交易法等有关法规。
　五、加强改革中期规划的研究制订工作，继续抓好综合改革试点。
    ２１、结合编制国民经济和社会发展的“八五”计划，由国家体改委组织社会力量，在总结十年改革经验和对体制中的重大问题进行深入调查研究的基础上，共同研究制订“八五”期间经济体制改革规划，力求将改革的目标、任务和步骤具体化，以发挥其对深化改革的指导作用。各地区及有关部门也要结合实际和“八五”计划，研究制定本地区、本部门的中期改革规划。
    地方体改部门应进入政府序列，充实力量，提高干部素质，改进工作作风。体改部门的同志必须加强学习，深入实际，调查研究，并要和计委等经济管理部门紧密配合，加强横向、纵向的信息交流，及时研究改革中出现的新问题，提出具体可行的对策建议。
    ２２、继续抓好综合、专项改革试点工作。总结广东、福建、海南改革开放试验区和若干有代表性的综合改革试点城市的经验，研究新情况、新问题，提出进一步搞好试点的新要求。积极推进产权制度、税利分流、市场组织、政府机构、住房商品化以及建立社会保障体系等方面的专项改革试点，及时总结经验，做好在面上推广的准备。
