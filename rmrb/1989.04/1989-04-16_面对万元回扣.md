With the development of the commodity economy, in a time when "kickbacks" are commonplace, the Communist Party members of the 101 Research Office at the Second Artillery Engineering Academy still adhere to an unwritten rule: although we lack the power to eradicate societal ills, we strive to maintain our personal integrity and absolutely do not accept even a single cent of unjust wealth. Over the past two years, the faculty members of this office have turned over 20,724 yuan in kickback cash and a 18-inch Hitachi brand color television, which they received from external procurement, to the authorities. In early March, the office was commended as an exemplary unit for integrity and honesty by the Political Department and the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Second Artillery.

The 101 Research Office bears the heavy burden of scientific research tasks, requiring the procurement of a large amount of experimental equipment each year. How should "kickbacks" be handled in economic transactions? The office party branch insists on positive education, guiding and encouraging faculty members to consciously uphold the sacred title and glorious image of Communist Party members. They maintain the noble character of intellectuals who are indifferent to fame and wealth, and conduct research in a clean and honest manner. The office director and party branch secretary, Zhao Baosheng, has led teams to the Ninth Institute of the Nuclear Industry and a certain factory in Beijing to purchase geophysical microwave instruments. He received kickbacks totaling 11,400 yuan on several occasions, each time turning over every cent to the organization. Once, the deputy director and deputy party branch secretary, Wang Shuren, purchased computers for the research office. The factory paid him 3,000 yuan in "goodwill money." Upon returning to the academy, he immediately deposited this amount into the financial office. The leaders' exemplary conduct and upright demeanor set a good example for the other colleagues in the office.

Last March, teacher Zhao Hongtai went to the Xi'an Long-Distance Telecommunications Equipment Sales Department to purchase television sets. After the transaction, the seller gave Zhao 804 yuan in cash as a token of appreciation. Zhao requested a written proof of the kickback amount, but the seller refused and repeatedly said that the kickback cash would not appear on the accounts of your unit, and why are you soldiers so honest? Zhao Hongtai politely told the seller that precisely because they are soldiers and party members, they must act with transparency and impartiality, and execute regulations without any compromise. His words deeply moved the sales clerks, who had no choice but to issue the proof.

　　面对万元回扣
    随着商品经济的发展，在“回扣”现象司空见惯的今天，二炮工程学院１０１教研室的共产党员们仍恪守着这样一条不成文的规矩：我们虽无治理社会弊病的回天之力，但务求自身廉洁清正，绝不贪占一分不义之财。两年来，该室教员将外出采购共得的２０７２４元回扣现金和一台１８英寸日立牌彩电，主动如数交公。３月初，该室作为清正廉洁先进单位受到二炮政治部和二炮纪委通报表彰。
    １０１教研室担负着繁重的科研任务，每年需添置大量实验器材。在经济交往中如何处置“回扣”？教研室党支部坚持从正面教育入手，引导鼓励教员自觉保持共产党员的神圣称号和光荣本色。维护知识分子淡泊明志的高贵品质，经济交往中不见利忘义，清清白白搞科研。室主任、支部书记赵保生几次带人到核工业部九院和北京某工厂购买地测微波仪，先后获回扣１１４００元，每次一文不少地上交组织。一次，副主任、支部副书记王树仁给教研室购买微机，厂方付给了他３０００元“好处费”。他回院后，立即到财务处将这笔钱入了帐。领导率先垂范，一身正气，为教研室其他同志做出了好样子。
    去年３月，教员赵洪太到西安长途电讯器材经销部购买电视机套件，成交后卖方送给赵８０４元现金作酬谢。赵教员要求写一张回扣数额证明，对方怎么也不肯，并再三说回扣现金在你们单位账面上保证显示不出来，你们当兵的怎么这般老实？赵洪太委婉地告诉对方，正因为我们是军人、党员，办事才要坦白无私，执行纪律和规定不能打半点折扣。一席话使经销部的营业员们深受感动，只得给他出具了证明。
