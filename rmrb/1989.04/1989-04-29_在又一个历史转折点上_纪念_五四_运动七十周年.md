In another historical turning point

— Commemorating the 70th Anniversary of the May Fourth Movement

Jì Yánzhì

On the afternoon of May 4, 1919, when more than 3,000 students in Beijing took to the streets shouting "Fight for sovereignty abroad, eliminate traitors at home," perhaps no one realized that this would mark the beginning of modern Chinese history.

Seventy years later, as Chinese Communists and the Chinese people sprint on the track of modernization, looking back at the past and forward to the future, people may sense that history is turning a new page in front of us.

Salvation—

The motive and main theme of the May Fourth Enlightenment Movement

Just as the French Revolution 200 years ago, the storming of the Bastille was just one of its climactic scenes; its source was a great Enlightenment movement that had been raging for decades. The student demonstrations of May 4, 1919, in China were an act of patriotism, and behind it was a great Eastern Enlightenment movement that shook the world.

Since 1840, when China was forced open by Western gunboats, the overriding contradiction was national peril. It can be said that the four characters "salvation and survival" run through the entire modern history of China.

Facing "a situation unprecedented in three thousand years," the awakened Chinese people opened their eyes and sought the way to save the nation from all over the world. First, they introduced Western technology and equipment, then they learned from Western political reforms, and thus one after another, the Self-Strengthening Movement, the Hundred Days' Reform, and the Xinhai Revolution were staged. But they all failed to change China's fate of decline.

At this time, a group of advanced intellectuals noticed that every major social change in the West was preceded by a revolution in thought, and thus began China's Enlightenment movement.

From the September 1915 issue of _Youth Magazine_ (renamed _New Youth_ a year later), in just a few years, a wave of Enlightenment surged around it, affecting the whole country.

The so-called Enlightenment movement, in Europe, was a cultural transformation from the Middle Ages to modern society; the banner of reason and humanism it raised, in essence, reflected the requirements of thought liberation and human liberation under the impulse of modern commodity economy.

In China, Enlightenment thinkers represented by Chen Duxiu, Li Dazhao, Lu Xun, and Hu Shi put forward the slogans of "cultural revolution" and "social revolution." On the one hand, they "single-handedly toppled the Confucian shop," settling accounts with old culture; on the other hand, they raised high the banner of "democracy" and "science," calling for new culture; and tried to use new culture to transform traditional national character.

Perhaps this new cultural movement full of modern colors can be seen as a new starting point for China's transition from traditional society to modern society. However, at that time, any modern impulse of Chinese society was first strangled by external enemies. The overriding task was still to save the nation from peril. The direct motive of the Chinese Enlightenment movement was to seek the truth of saving the country and the people.

The May Fourth era was the second era of a hundred schools of thought contending since the Spring and Autumn period in Chinese history, and the freedom of scholarship and the openness of thought were unprecedented. At that time, almost all the world's trends of thought, from ancient Greek Plato to Chinese Confucius, from the Enlightenment thinker Voltaire to the anarchist Kropotkin, from Saint-Simon to Marx, were all laid out before the Chinese people.

Why did the advanced Chinese youth at that time choose Marxism? The reason was simple: it could guide us to save the country and the people.

It is somewhat ironic that the First World War broke out in the homeland of "democracy and science," and the war chariot of imperialism trampled on reason. The Paris Peace Conference saw the triumph of might over right, and the robbers divided the spoils, even to the head of China, which was nominally a victorious country. All this could not but arouse the disgust and disappointment of many Chinese people with Western capitalism. It was at this time that the news of the success of the Russian October Revolution came, immediately becoming an inspiring example for us. People suddenly discovered that Marxism was the true essence of Western civilization. This is why at that time a large number of the most learned and most liberated thinkers chose to abandon pragmatism, anarchism, and social Darwinism and other various trends of thought, and accept Marxism-Leninism. This is the historical truth.

The fact that the great powers continued to encroach on China's sovereignty at the Paris Peace Conference forced Chinese students to take to the streets. From May 4 of that year, the May Fourth New Culture Movement turned into the May Fourth Patriotic Movement. The urgent task of salvation had to be given the highest priority. Various Enlightenment thoughts also had to first show their mettle in the action of salvation and accept the test of practice.

The urgent task of salvation shaped the history of China for the next 30 years after the May Fourth Movement.

The Chinese Communist Party, which completed the ideological and organizational preparations in the May Fourth Movement and suddenly appeared on the Chinese political stage, was from the beginning the most powerful promoter of the May Fourth cause and spirit. The main stronghold of the Enlightenment movement, _New Youth_, became the theoretical journal of the CCP after 1921. The early leaders of the Party were almost all leaders or heroes of the May Fourth Movement.

However, the severe situation did not leave the Chinese Communists with the leisure to engage in pure cultural enlightenment. The 28-year political and military struggle, whether against domestic feudal, comprador, and bureaucratic capitalist forces or against foreign invaders, was directly or indirectly engaged in salvation. And the enlightenment work led by the Chinese Communist Party, including the resolute anti-feudal and the renewal of the people's spiritual outlook, could only be carried out in political and military struggles.

The Chinese nation has suffered from internal and external troubles for more than a hundred years. On the political stage of modern China, various political forces have appeared, why was it that in 1949 it was the political force led by the Chinese Communist Party that won the national power? The reason is that only it brought true independence to the nation and dignity to the people, and brought hope for unity and strength.

This is the people's choice. This is the verdict of history. This is also the inevitable result of the Enlightenment movement and patriotic movement originating from the May Fourth Movement continuing to develop along the historical path prescribed by history.

Reform—

The historical response to the May Fourth call

If we regard the May Fourth Movement as an important attempt for China to transform from a traditional society to a modern society, then it has left us with rich fruits, but it has also left us with unfinished tasks.

The realization of modernization or modern society is the dream of several generations of Chinese people. However, the dream of enriching the country and strengthening the army in the style of Li Hongzhang sank into the sea with the destruction of the Beiyang Fleet; the dream of constitutional monarchy in the style of Kang Youwei quickly collapsed with the beheading of the "Six Gentlemen of Wuxu"; Sun Yat-sen's republican revolution overthrew the imperial system, but only left a republican shell. The traditional society of China was only superficially cut off a queue, and in essence, it remained almost unchanged.

The fighters of _New Youth_ also once called for the establishment of a "new society and new country" and specifically proposed to use democracy and science to "treat the darkness of China's politics, morality, academia, and thought." This attempt to push China into modern society through cultural enlightenment also hit a wall in reality. As for the May Fourth cultural enlightenment movement itself, it almost only caused excitement among a part of the intellectuals at that time and did not touch the foundation of society.

The traditional society of China has a foundation of two thousand years, deeply rooted in the thick soil of natural economy and feudal politics. The requirement of China's modernization is a forced adaptation in the face of foreign invasion, not like the West, which is the natural result of the internal economic and social development. Therefore, if the economic and political foundations of this society are not touched, changing political banners is certainly ineffective, and pushing cultural changes alone is also bound to be at a loss.

Why did the new democratic revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party succeed? An important reason is that it carried out a fairly thorough land revolution, struck at the feudal landlord forces, shook the political and economic foundations of traditional society, and followed the historical trend of social change.

It is particularly worth mentioning that when the Chinese Communists carried out political revolution and military struggle, they combined it with large-scale popular enlightenment work. "Awakening hundreds of millions of workers and peasants," who says it is not a certain form of continuation of the May Fourth Enlightenment movement?

Almost every substantial change in Chinese society since modern times has been the result of the interaction of political, economic, and cultural changes. Efforts in any single aspect often have little effect.

However, we have encountered a difficulty from the beginning to the end, that is, the low level of productivity. Even when New China was founded, the modern industrial component accounted for only a few percent of the entire economy. A vast expanse of natural economy and semi-natural economy could not support a modern society, nor could it support a modern civilization.

The victory of the people's revolution led by the Chinese Communist Party cleared the political obstacles for China to move towards modernization, but there were still many difficulties in economy and culture on the road to modernization.

After the founding of New China, the Party led the people of the whole country to vigorously promote industrialization and achieved remarkable results that attracted worldwide attention. This was essentially a foundation-laying work for future modernization.

In the 1950s, we chose the product economy system and the corresponding political system, which became the target of today's reform. Some young people find it hard to understand: if we knew today, why did we do it then? The depth of the problem lies in the fact that our initial choice was not a sudden impulse. On the one hand, the Western world imposed an economic blockade on us, and on the other hand, the socialist neighbors in the north achieved rapid economic growth through high centralization. China, following the example of the latter, also rapidly promoted large-scale industrialization.

The shortcomings of the product economy system of socialist countries are gradually exposed as time goes by. Moreover, our product economy system was established on a land where productivity and culture were both relatively backward, which made its shortcomings enlarged under the shadow of the backwardness of the traditional society that had not yet passed away. It developed all the way to the farce of the "Cultural Revolution," which was a return to traditional society under the banner of anti-traditionalism and a reaction against the spirit of the May Fourth Movement under the banner of "cultural revolution."

In late 1978, the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party finally proposed reform and emancipation of the mind, re-emphasized the mission of modernization, and re-advocated democracy and science. From a certain angle, this is a historical response to the May Fourth Movement after 60 years. It was the Chinese Communist Party that initiated a new Enlightenment movement.

This new Enlightenment has been going on for 10 years. It is both a continuation of the May Fourth Enlightenment movement and a comprehensive transcendence of the May Fourth.

A most striking sign of transcending the May Fourth is that China's reform is beginning to move towards socialist commodity economy with planning.

So far, the modern society of all nations in the world has been established on the foundation of commodity economy. China can only move towards the modernization of tomorrow through the ladder of commodity economy.

This tomorrow of modernization, of course, needs modern industry, agriculture, and science and technology as its foundation, but it is by no means limited to the field of economy and technology. Modernization is a progression of civilization and a transformation of society, that is, a transition from traditional society to modern society. It should include economic modernization, political modernization, cultural modernization, social modernization, and the modernization of the individual.

Our reform today is such an all-round reform. It wants to turn the dream of national rejuvenation over the past 150 years into reality, and it wants to make the call of the modern enlightenment 70 years ago fully realized on this land.

Commodity economy—

The soil for the growth of democracy and science

Democracy and science are the core of the May Fourth spirit. When we today's reform continues to call for democracy and science, people cannot help but ask: why do the two gentlemen "Democracy" and "Science" have such a difficult fate in China?

It should be pointed out that the democracy and science discussed since the May Fourth are the democratic spirit and scientific spirit of modern times, which were born in the process of Western modernization. Their source can be traced back to the cultural tradition that began with ancient Greece. But their formation was after the passage of the medieval despotism and superstition, after the Italian Renaissance and the French Enlightenment. This cultural spirit combined with the then developing capitalist commodity economy, nurtured the modern democratic system of the West.

China has a cultural and economic background completely different from the West, and democratic spirit and scientific rationality are difficult to break out of the shell under the two-thousand-year-old feudal rule. The closed natural economy did not put forward a strong demand for democracy and science. Especially, China has always lacked the course of fully developed commodity economy, so when the May Fourth enlightenment thinkers invited the two gentlemen "Democracy" and "Science" from the West, it was difficult to find a foothold.

At that time, China was not without attempts at parliamentary democracy. In 1923, the warlord Cao Kun bought 590 members of the National Assembly for 5,000 silver dollars each to be elected as the President, known as the "bribe-selected President." History only left a laughing stock for the parliamentary democracy of the old China.

In such a social and political environment, the Chinese Communists took another road to seek democracy. The banner the Party raised was called "New Democratic Revolution." It uncompromisingly struck at the feudal landlord forces and their political representatives. On the other hand, the Party mobilized the masses and relied on the masses to carry out the revolution, creating a situation of extensive mass participation in politics that even Western democrats were surprised at. The democratic centralism practiced within the revolutionary ranks, as a form of democracy, also made the revolutionary base areas a genuine democratic base area. It can be said that the Chinese Communist Party started with democracy and won with democracy.

As for science, in the eyes of the May Fourth enlightenment thinkers, it was more of a spirit of reason. Chen Duxiu clearly stated in the preface to _New Youth_: "What is science? It is the concept of things that we have about things, the synthesis of objective phenomena, and the appeal to subjective reason without contradiction." This is quite different from our narrow understanding of science as natural science and technology. As a scientific rationality, for the Chinese people who shouldered the heavy responsibility of national rejuvenation and salvation, the most important thing was to scientifically grasp the direction of society and the times. The Chinese Communists called the doctrine they followed "scientific socialism," and our cause is a cause guided by scientific rationality.

Reviewing the road our Party has traveled, including the course after the founding of the nation, whenever we were correct and victorious, it was the time when the spirit of democracy and science was respected and practiced; whenever we made mistakes and suffered setbacks, it was the time when we abandoned the spirit of democracy and science.

Our profound lesson is precisely: why democracy and science were sometimes picked up and sometimes discarded? It lacks institutional construction and often falls into the arbitrariness of personal rule.

Modern democracy, as a political system, needs legal protection, but it is by no means realized by a few legal provisions. Democracy is also a cultural spirit that needs to cultivate democratic consciousness throughout the nation. This enlightenment work is certainly not effective in the short term. In the absence of democratic consciousness, any legal provision will be null and void.

Democracy needs the wide participation of the masses, and in essence, it is the self-reflection of the collective and individual interests of the people. The traditional mass movement also had a strong factor of mass participation in its healthy development period, but under the product economy system, everyone eats a "big pot of rice," and the citizen consciousness is drowned by egalitarianism, so it is difficult to develop modern socialist democratic politics under the old system.

Modern socialist democratic politics needs socialist commodity economy as its basis for development, needs to generate the concept of equal citizen rights and obligations in the equal exchange of socialist market, and cultivate modern socialist democratic consciousness.

Today, it is still our Party that correctly grasps the historical trend of society and clearly proposes the two major goals of developing socialist commodity economy and building socialist democratic politics when determining the reform program of China. These two major goals are like two wings, complementary to each other. With the strong booster of socialist spiritual civilization construction, it is possible to take off the Chinese nation and fly directly to the modernization of tomorrow.

However, the construction of commodity economy and democratic politics is a historical process. They are not problems that can be solved by someone making a decision or issuing a document from above. The economic system reform of these years, we have fully experienced the difficulty of market development. It is difficult to imagine that democratic politics can be completed alone in one morning, separating from the process of commodity economy. The lesson of the May Fourth democratic call detached from the economic base is worth our attention.

We must firmly carry out the construction of democratic politics. Since it is a construction, it can only be built brick by brick as the foundation of commodity economy is solidified. This may be the fastest way.

National self-confidence—

The hope to get through the difficulties

The Chinese nation has come to another historical turning point. We are bidding farewell to the traditional society and walking towards the modern society; we are bidding farewell to poverty, backwardness, and ignorance, and walking towards prosperity, democracy, and civilization. The historical turning point is reform.

China's reform has entered its eleventh year. The early days of power delegation and benefit sharing that pleased everyone have quickly passed, and the difficult period of the old and new systems holding each other has come.

This is a true period of reform difficulties. The foundation of the old system has already been shaken, although it is reluctant to withdraw from the fields of economy, politics, and culture, but it is no longer able to maintain the old order. The framework of the new system is being constructed, but it does not yet have enough strength to establish a new order. This forms a state of social disorder to a certain extent. Inflation, moral chaos, corruption, and the uselessness of studying are all derived from this.

In such a period of new and old replacement, social trends also present a complicated situation. With the rise of cultural studies in recent years, almost all the new and old cultural and social trends since modern times have surged in. This situation has a bit of the flavor of the May Fourth period. The collision and confrontation of various trends of thought are not necessarily a bad thing. If the great debate of the May Fourth period promoted the spread of Marxism in China, then in the great cultural debate of the late 20th century, there is also every reason to hope for the new development of Marxism in China.

However, it is worth noting that with the difficulties encountered by the reform in recent years, pessimistic and impatient emotions have alternately appeared in society, especially among some young people.

The alarm that China may be "expelled from the game" has not been lifted, and maintaining a sense of crisis, worrying about the country and the people, is a precious awakening of patriotic youth. However, a sense of crisis does not mean pessimism and despair; China's backwardness in some aspects does not mean that there is no way out. Over the past century and a half, we have encountered many national crises and have all gotten through them. Now, we are about to take the road to true national rejuvenation through reform. The difficulties ahead can be said to be a squat before the jump, which is fundamentally different from many crises in history. Pessimism and despair are completely unreasonable.

We must establish national self-confidence and reconstruct and rebuild a new national culture. This is a task that the May Fourth Movement did not have time to complete.

The economic modernization and political democratization of Western countries have gone through a journey of two or three hundred years. History has not left so much time for today's China, and we cannot repeat the path that Western capitalism took in its early years. The Chinese people are advancing towards a modern society under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. This is a firm and unshakable goal, but it is by no means a fruit that can be picked up with a stretch of the hand. As the greatest social transformation in the history of China over thousands of years, it is bound to be accompanied by intense pains and may also encounter twists and turns. To expect the road of reform to be smooth and straight is only a fantasy. Young people who are determined to devote themselves to the great cause of China's reform must learn to work with perseverance and practicality, avoid impatience and irrational behavior. Because whether it is economic construction or democratic construction, detaching from actual possibilities and rushing ahead with one's own wishes often leads to failure.

We must, under the guidance of a common ideal, form a strong national cohesion. Relying on socialist commodity economy and socialist democratic politics, we will achieve the unity of individual vitality and collective strength. China is no longer the China of 70 years ago, the old semi-feudal and semi-colonial China has long given way to the new China under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and we have already taken decisive steps on the road of reform. We will advance towards the common goal of revitalizing China.

This is the enlightenment and expectation of the modern history of China since the May Fourth Movement to today's generation of Chinese people.

　　在又一个历史转折点上   
    ——纪念“五四”运动七十周年
    季言志
    １９１９年５月４日下午，当北京３０００多名学生走上街头高喊“外争主权，内除国贼”之时，恐怕没有人意识到：这会成为中国现代史的开端。
    ７０年后，中国共产党人和中国人民在现代化的跑道上冲刺，回首往事，展望未来，人们也许能够觉察到：历史正在我们身边翻开新的一页。
    救亡——
    “五四”启蒙运动的动因与主旋律
    正如２００年前的法国大革命，攻占巴士底狱只是它高潮的一幕；它的源头，是一场激荡了数十年的伟大启蒙运动。中国７０年前５月４日的学生示威，则是一次爱国行动，它的背后也是一场震古烁今的东方启蒙运动。
    中国自从１８４０年被西方的炮舰轰开大门，压倒一切的矛盾是民族危亡。可以说，“救亡图存”四个字贯穿于整整一部中国近代史。
    “面对三千年未有之变局”，早醒的中国人睁开眼睛，向全世界寻觅救国之道。先是引进西方的器物和技术，接着是学习西方的政制变革，于是一幕接一幕地演出洋务运动、戊戌变法和辛亥革命。但它们都未能改变中国衰败的命运。
    就在这时，一批先进的知识分子注意到西方的每一次社会大变革都有思想革命作前奏，由此开始了中国的启蒙运动。
    从１９１５年９月《青年杂志》创刊起（一年后更名为《新青年》），短短数年间，在它的周围激荡起波及全国的启蒙思潮。
    所谓启蒙运动，在欧洲，它是走出中世纪走向现代社会时的一次文化转型；它所高举的理性和人道主义的旗帜，实质反映了现代商品经济冲动下思想解放和人的解放的要求。
    在中国，以陈独秀、李大钊、鲁迅、胡适等为代表的启蒙思想家提出了“文化革命”和“社会革命”的口号。他们一面“只手打倒孔家店”，清算旧文化；一面高扬“民主”与“科学”，呼唤新文化；并试图以新文化去改造传统的国民性。
    或许可以把这场充满现代色彩的新文化运动看作中国从传统社会向现代社会转轨的一个新起点。但是，当时的中国社会任何现代化的冲动，都首先遭到外敌的扼杀。压倒一切的依然是挽救民族之危亡。中国启蒙运动的直接动因，是寻求救国救民的真理。
    “五四”时代是中国历史上春秋战国以来第二次百家争鸣时代，学术的自由与思想的开放是前所未有的。当时几乎全世界的思潮，从古希腊的柏拉图到中国的孔夫子，从启蒙思想家伏尔泰到无政府主义者克鲁泡特金，从圣西门到马克思，统统摆在中国人面前。
    当时先进的中国青年为什么会选择马克思主义？理由很简单：它能指导我们救国救民。
    不无讽刺意味的是，第一次世界大战发生在“民主与科学”的故乡，帝国主义的战车践踏了理性。巴黎和会上强权战胜公理，强盗分赃竟分到名为战胜国的中国头上。这一切，不得不引起许多中国人对西方资本主义的厌恶和失望。就在这时，传来了俄国十月革命成功的消息，立即成为鼓舞我们的榜样。人们突然发现，马克思主义才是西方文明的真正精华。这就是为什么当时一大批最有学问、思想最解放的知识分子，会不约而同地抛弃实用主义、无政府主义和社会达尔文主义等形形色色的思潮，接受马克思列宁主义的历史真实原因。
    巴黎和会上列强继续侵夺中国主权的事实，逼得中国学生走上街头。从５月４日这天起，“五四”新文化运动转入“五四”爱国运动。不得不把救亡行动放到最优先的位置上。各种启蒙思想也不得不先在救亡行动中一显身手，接受实践的检验。
    救亡的急迫任务塑造了“五四”以后整整３０年的中国历史。
    在“五四”运动中完成了思想准备和组织准备、在中国政治舞台上突然现身的中国共产党，一开始就是“五四”事业和“五四”精神最有力的继续推进者。启蒙运动的主要阵地《新青年》在１９２１年后成为中共的理论刊物。党的早期领导人几乎都是“五四”运动的领导者或勇士。
    但是，严峻的时局再也没有留给中国共产党人进行单纯的文化启蒙的从容机会。延续２８年的政治斗争和军事斗争，无论是反对国内的封建、买办和官僚资本势力还是抗击外国侵略者，都是直接或间接从事救亡。而中国共产党领导的启蒙工作，包括坚决的反封建和更新人民的精神面貌，只能在政治和军事斗争中展开。
    中华民族１００多年来内忧外患交织。在近代以来的中国政治舞台上出现过种种政治力量，为什么到１９４９年偏偏中国共产党领导下的这支政治力量赢得了全国政权？原因就是唯有它才给灾难深重的中国带来国家的真正独立和人民的尊严，带来统一与强大的希望。
    这是人民的选择。这是历史的裁决。这也是发端于“五四”的启蒙运动和爱国运动沿着历史规定的通道继续发展的必然结果。
    改革——“五四”呼喊的历史应答
    如果把“五四”运动看作中国从传统社会向现代社会转型的一次重要尝试，那么，它留下了丰硕的成果，也留下了未完成的课题。
    实现近代化或现代化，是几代中国人的梦想。但是，李鸿章式的富国强兵梦随着北洋舰队的覆没沉入海底；康有为式的君主立宪梦随着“戊戌六君子”的断头迅速破灭；孙中山的共和革命推翻了帝制，却只剩下一个共和的躯壳。中国的传统社会只是在表面上剪掉一根辫子，实质上几乎原封未动。
    《新青年》的斗士们也曾经呼喊要建立一个“新社会新国家”，并具体提出要用民主和科学来“救治中国政治上、道德上、学术上、思想上一切的黑暗”。这种企图以文化启蒙推动中国进入现代社会的美好愿望也在现实面前碰了壁。就“五四”的文化启蒙运动本身而言，它在当时几乎只是在一部分知识分子中产生了激动，并没有触动社会的基础。
    中国的传统社会有两千年的根基，它深深地扎根在自然经济和宗法政治的厚土之中。中国的现代化要求，是在外敌入侵面前的被迫应变，并非像西方那样是内部经济社会发展的自然结果。所以，如果不触动这个社会的经济和政治基础，变换政治旗帜固然无济于事，单独推进文化变革也难免无路可走。
    中国共产党领导的新民主主义革命为什么能取得成功？一个重要原因是进行了相当彻底的土地革命，打击了封建地主势力，撼动了传统社会的政治和经济的基石，顺应了社会变迁的历史走向。
    尤其值得一提的是，中国共产党人在进行政治革命和军事斗争时，配合以大规模的民众启蒙工作。“唤起工农千百万”，谁说不是“五四”启蒙运动的某种形式的继续？
    近代以来中国社会的每一个实质性变化，几乎都是政治、经济、文化变革交互作用的结果。任何单一方面的努力往往收效甚微。
    然而，我们自始至终遇到的一个困难是生产力水平低下。直到新中国成立时，现代工业成分只占全部经济的百分之十几。一片自然经济和半自然经济的汪洋大海，无法托起一个现代社会，也无法托起一个现代文明。
    中国共产党领导的人民革命胜利，为中国通向现代化扫清了政治障碍，但走上现代化之路，还有经济与文化的重重难关。
    新中国成立后，党领导全国人民全力推进工业化，并取得了举世瞩目的成就。这实质上是为日后的现代化做一项打基础工作。
    我们在５０年代选择了产品经济体制和相应的政治体制，成为今天改革的对象。一些青年人觉得不可理解：早知今日，何必当初？问题的深刻性在于我们当初的选择并非一时心血来潮。一面是西方世界对我们经济封锁，一面是北方的社会主义友邻用高度集权的计划实现了经济高速增长。中国仿照后者的榜样同样迅速推进了大规模的工业化。
    社会主义国家的产品经济体制缺乏活力的弊端是随着时间的推移逐步暴露出来的。再加上我们的产品经济体制是建立在生产力和文化都相当落后的国土上，又使它的弊端在传统社会尚未逝去的落后阴影下得到放大。一直发展到“文化大革命”的闹剧，就是在反传统的口号下向传统社会的回归，在“文化革命”的旗帜下对“五四”精神的反动。
    １９７８年尾，党的十一届三中全会终于提出改革和思想解放，重新强调现代化的使命，重新倡导民主与科学。从一定角度看，这是对“五四”运动隔着６０年的一次历史呼应。正是中国共产党，发起了一场新的启蒙运动。
    这场新启蒙已经进行了１０年。它同“五四”启蒙运动一脉相承，又全面地超越了“五四”。
    超越“五四”的一个最鲜明的标志，是中国的改革开始向社会主义有计划的商品经济进发。
    迄今为止，全世界各民族的现代社会，都是在商品经济的地基上建立起来的。中国也只有通过商品经济的阶梯，才能走向现代化的明天。
    这个现代化的明天，当然需要现代化的工业、农业、科技为基础，但它决不局限于经济科技领域。现代化是一种文明的演进和社会的转型，也就是从传统社会向现代社会转变。它应当包括经济现代化、政治现代化、文化现代化、社会现代化和人的现代化。
    我们今天的改革，就是这样的全方位改革。它要把１５０年来的民族复兴之梦变为现实，它要让７０年前现代启蒙者的呼喊全面落实在这片国土上。
    商品经济——民主与科学生长的土壤
    民主与科学，是“五四”精神的核心。当我们今天的改革继续呼唤民主与科学时，人们不免要问：为什么“德”、“赛”两先生在中国有这般困难的遭遇？
    应当指出，从“五四”开始讨论的民主与科学是指近代的民主精神与科学精神，它们是在西方近代化的过程中生长起来的。它们的源头，可以一直追溯到从古希腊开始的文化传统。但它们的成形，却是在渡过了中世纪的专制与迷信之后，在意大利文艺复兴和法国启蒙运动之后。这种文化精神同当时正在发展着的资本主义商品经济相结合，孕育了西方近代的民主制度。
    中国有着与西方完全不同的文化和经济背景，民主精神与科学理性很难在两千多年的封建统治下破壳而出，封闭的自然经济也没有对民主与科学提出自身的强烈需要。尤其是中国始终缺少商品经济充分发展这一课，所以当“五四”的启蒙者从西方请来“德”、“赛”两先生时，很难找到立足之地。
    当时的中国，并不是没有尝试过议会民主。１９２３年，北洋军阀曹锟以５０００银元一票的价格收买国会议员５９０人，被选为大总统，史称“贿选总统”。历史只给旧中国的议会民主留下笑柄。
    在这样的社会政治环境下，中国共产党人走上了另一条寻求民主之路。党高举的旗帜就叫“新民主主义革命”。它不妥协地打击封建地主势力及其政治代表。另一方面，党发动群众和依靠群众进行革命，造成了连西方民主主义者都惊讶的民众广泛参与政治的局面。在革命队伍内部实行的民主集中制，作为民主的一种形式，也使革命根据地成为名副其实的民主根据地。可以说，中国共产党是搞民主起家并靠民主取得胜利的。
    至于科学，在“五四”启蒙者那里，更多的是指一种理性精神。陈独秀在《新青年》发刊词中明确说：“科学者何？吾人对于事物之概念，综合客观之现象，诉之主观理性而不矛盾之谓也。”这同我们一度把科学狭窄地理解为自然科学与技术是有很大不同的。作为一种科学理性，对于肩负民族复兴和救亡重任的中国人来说，最要紧的是科学地把握社会和时代的走向。中国共产党人把自己所遵循的学说叫做“科学社会主义”，我们的事业正是一种科学理性指导下的事业。
    回顾我们党走过的道路，包括建国以后的历程，凡是正确的时候、胜利的时候，都是民主和科学精神得到尊重和实行的时候；凡是犯错误的时候、受挫折的时候，都是丢掉了民主和科学精神的时候。
    我们深刻的教训恰恰在于：为什么民主与科学会被时而拿起时而丢掉？它缺少一种制度建设，而往往落入人治的随意性之中。
    现代民主作为一种政治制度，需要法律的保障，但它又决不是有了若干法律条文就能实现的。民主又是一种文化精神，需要在全民族上上下下培养民主意识。这种启蒙工作决不是短期内能奏效的。在缺乏民主意识的人那里，任何法律条文都将形同虚设。
    民主需要广泛的大众参与，它在本质上是人民大众集体和各自利益的自主反映。传统的群众运动在其健康发展的时期，也有大众参与的强烈因素，然而在产品经济体制下，大家都吃一锅“大锅饭”，公民意识被平均主义淹没了，因此在旧体制下，很难发展现代化的社会主义民主政治。
    现代化的社会主义民主政治需要社会主义的商品经济作为它发展的基础，需要在社会主义的市场平等交换中产生平等的公民权利与义务观念，培养出现代化的社会主义民主意识。
    今天，仍然是我们党正确地把握了社会的历史走向，在确定中国的改革纲领时明确地提出了发展社会主义商品经济和建设社会主义民主政治这两大目标。这两大目标有如双翼，相辅相成，再加上社会主义精神文明建设这一强有力的助推器，就有可能载着中华民族起飞，直抵现代化的明天。
    但是，商品经济和民主政治的建设都是一种历史的过程。它们决不是谁下个决心或者上面发个文件就能解决问题的。这几年的经济体制改革，我们充分体验了市场发育的艰难。很难设想，民主政治可以甩开商品经济的进程独自在一个早晨完成。“五四”以来脱离经济基础的民主呼喊屡屡落空的教训值得我们记取。
    我们要坚定地进行民主政治的建设。既然是一种建设，就只能随着商品经济地基的打实，一砖一瓦地垒筑。这也许倒是最快捷的办法。
    民族自信——渡过难关的希望
    中华民族来到了又一个历史转折点上。我们正在告别传统社会，走向现代社会；我们正在告别贫穷、落后、愚昧，走向富强、民主、文明。这个历史大转轨的契机，就是改革。
    中国的改革进入第十一个年头。早期放权让利式的皆大欢喜迅即过去，新旧体制相持的困难时期来到了。
    这是一个真正的改革困难时期。旧体制的基石早已动摇，虽然它迟迟不肯退出经济、政治、文化等领域，但已无力再维持旧的秩序。新体制的框架正在构建，它还没有足够的力量建立新的秩序。这就形成了在一定程度上的社会失序状态。通货膨胀、道德混乱、腐败现象、读书无用等等，都是由此而起。
    在这样一个新旧交替时期，社会思潮也出现了错综复杂的情形。随着这几年文化学研讨热的兴起，几乎近代以来新旧各种文化社会思潮都涌了进来。这种状况很有几分像“五四”时期。各种思潮的碰撞和交锋并不是什么坏事。如果说，“五四”时期的大论战促进了马克思主义在中国的传播，那么，在二十世纪末叶的文化大讨论中，也完全有理由希望获得马克思主义在中国的新发展。
    然而值得注意的是，随着近年来改革遇到困难，社会上、尤其是部分青年中交替出现悲观情绪和急躁情绪。
    中国有可能被“开除球籍”的警报并未解除，保持忧患意识，忧国忧民，正是爱国青年的可贵觉悟。但是，忧患意识决不等于悲观失望；中国在某些方面的落后也决不等于永无出头之日。一个半世纪以来，我们遇到过许多次民族危机，都闯过来了。如今，我们就要通过改革走上真正的民族复兴之路了，眼前的困难，可说是起跳前的一蹲，同历史上的许多次危机有本质的不同，悲观失望是完全没有理由的。
    我们要树立民族自信心，要改造和重建新的民族文化。这是“五四”没有来得及完成的事业。
    西方各国的经济现代化和政治民主化，曾经走过了二三百年的路程。历史没有给今天的中国留下这么多时间，我们也不可能重复西方资本主义早年走过的路。中国人民正在中国共产党领导下朝着现代社会迈进。这是一个坚定不移的目标，但又决不是一个伸手就可以拿到的果子。作为中国几千年历史上最伟大的一次社会转型，势必伴随着剧烈的阵痛，也可能出现曲折。要求改革的道路平坦又笔直，只能是一种空想。有志于投身中国改革伟大事业的青年，一定要学会韧性而踏实的工作精神，避免急躁情绪和不冷静的行为。因为无论经济建设还是民主建设，脱离实际可能性，一厢情愿地急躁冒进，往往欲速则不达。
    我们必须在一个共同理想的引导下，形成一种坚强的民族凝聚力。依靠社会主义商品经济和社会主义民主政治，造成个体的活力与集体的合力相统一。中国毕竟早已不是７０年前的中国了，半封建半殖民地的旧中国早已让位于中国共产党领导下的社会主义的新中国，而且已经在改革的道路上迈出决定性的步伐。我们将朝着振兴中华的共同目标一往无前。
    这就是“五四”以来的一部中国现代史对今天一代中国人的启迪和瞩望。（附图片）
