Recently, two incidents of villagers gathering to cause trouble have occurred within the North China Oilfield in Hebei Province, seriously affecting the normal production of the oilfield.

On April 4, after the power line stolen by Nan Dong Village in Xian County was cut off by the Third Oil Extraction Plant, several hundred villagers from the village, armed with sticks, rushed into the Second Brigade of the Third Oil Extraction Plant. They smashed one worker's dormitory, injured three workers, and damaged workers' living supplies.

From April 2 to 3, after the power line stolen by Cheng Nei Village in Cheng Guan Town, Shenze County was cut off by the power inspection personnel of the Fourth Exploration Company, more than a hundred villagers caused trouble at the company every day. They removed the covers from five transformers, blocked the company's main gate with tractors, preventing vehicles from entering or exiting, and seized a camera worth 130,000 yuan, beating the camera operator.

It is hoped that relevant departments will take measures to effectively protect the production and living order of the oilfield and ensure the safety of oilfield workers.

　　村民聚众滋事  骚扰华北油田
    最近，河北省境内的华北油田连续发生两起村民聚众滋扰事件，严重影响了油田的正常生产。
    ４月４日，河间县南冬村盗窃油田电力的线路被采油三厂掐断后，这个村数百名村民手持木棍等冲入采油三厂二大队，砸坏１间职工宿舍，打伤３名工人，损坏职工生活用品等。
    深泽县城关镇城内村盗窃油田电力的线路被勘探四公司查电人员掐断后，从４月２日到３日，每天百余村民到公司闹事。他们将公司的５个变压器的１５个铃壳卸掉，开来拖拉机堵死公司机关大门，不让车辆出入，抢走价值１３万元的摄像机并追打摄像人员。
    呼吁有关部门采取措施，切实保护油田生产、生活秩序，保障油田职工安全。
