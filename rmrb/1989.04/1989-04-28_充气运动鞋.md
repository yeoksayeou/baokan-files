Air-cushioned sports shoes designed and manufactured by the American Nike company have become trusted partners and indispensable "weapons" for some big stars to achieve outstanding results. Therefore, Nike shoes are also favored by many sports enthusiasts who admire these stars. Last year, Nike introduced a new product—air-cushioned shoes with an air-cushioned sole. When wearing these shoes for exercise, air flows smoothly under the feet, preventing foot injuries and reducing the burden and fatigue on the feet. They are particularly suitable for hiking, walking, and jogging.

　　充气运动鞋
    美国耐克公司设计生产的各种田径运动鞋，已成为当今一些大明星创造优异成绩信得过的伙伴和必不可少的“武器”。耐克鞋因此也受到不少崇拜明星的体育爱好者青睐。去年，耐克公司又推出了新产品——充气鞋，使用充气夹层底。穿上这种鞋运动时，脚下有气体滚滚流过，避免了脚底受伤，减轻了脚部的负担和疲劳，特别适合于郊游、散步及慢跑。
