Haitian rebel soldiers surrender to the government

	New York, April 12 - Port-au-Prince: 370 soldiers and 40 officers from the Haitian "Desalines" regiment, who participated in last week's armed rebellion, surrendered to the headquarters of the armed forces today.

	It is believed that if the number of surrendered and deceased (about 40) rebels is accurate, some rebels have gone underground.

	The Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, has returned to calm today, although sporadic gunshots could still be heard last night. Shops have been open for the second consecutive day, but schools remain closed.
