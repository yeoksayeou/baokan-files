	As a football player, he achieved little success in his home country but gained immense fame abroad. His name is Hugo Sanchez.

	Sanchez is a Mexican, and he has been playing football in Spain for nearly eight years. On the eve of the 1986 World Cup, the Mexican fans regarded him as a "savior," hoping he could lead the Mexican team to achieve excellent results. However, this star did not perform well, not even up to his usual standard, causing the Mexican team to be eliminated early. The image of the "savior" in the eyes of his compatriots plummeted.

	After the World Cup, Sanchez returned to Spain somewhat dejected.

	Perhaps because he was far from his homeland, he felt less burdened and regained his vigor on the field. In the 1986-1987 season, he scored 34 goals, becoming the best scorer in Spain for the third consecutive year. In the 1987-1988 season, he once again won the title of best scorer, setting a record for the Spanish first division league.

	Sanchez arrived in Spain in 1981 and first played for the Atletico Madrid team. In 1985, he transferred to Real Madrid. Spanish top star Emilio Butragueño, Argentine star Jorge Valdano, and last year's addition of West German player Uli Stielike all played in this team. In front of Sanchez, these stars all seemed to fade.

	Currently, the 1988-1989 season is nearing its end, and Real Madrid is in the final sprint to win the Spanish first division championship for the 24th time. If Sanchez can once again become the best scorer, he will become the most outstanding scorer in Spanish football history. Previously, only Alfredo Di Stéfano had won this honor five times, but he did not achieve consecutive wins.

　　一个墨西哥人在西班牙
    作为一名足球运动员，在自己的祖国没有取得什么成就，在国外却获得了巨大成功。他的名字叫乌戈·桑切斯。
    桑切斯是墨西哥人，在西班牙踢球已近八年。１９８６年世界杯足球赛前夕，东道主墨西哥的球迷把他看作一颗“救星”，盼望他能够率领墨西哥队获得优异成绩。可是，这位球星却表现不佳，甚至没有发挥出一般水平，致使墨西哥队过早地被淘汰出局。“救星”在同胞心目中的形象一落千丈。
    世界杯大赛之后，桑切斯颇有些灰溜溜地回到了西班牙。
    也许是因为远离故土，反而不背什么包袱，他重又生龙活虎地驰骋绿茵场。在１９８６至１９８７年赛季里，他一共踢进３４个球，连续第三年成为西班牙最佳射手。１９８７至１９８８年赛季，他再次荣膺最佳射手，创下了西班牙甲级联赛有史以来的蝉联纪录。
    桑切斯１９８１年到西班牙后，先在马德里竞技队效力，１９８５年转至皇家马德里队。西班牙头号球星布特拉格诺、阿根廷名将巴尔达诺都在这个队效力，去年又有西德的舒斯特加盟。在桑切斯面前，这些名将都变得黯然失色。
    目前，１９８８至１９８９年赛季已近尾声，皇家马德里队在为第２４次夺取西班牙甲级联赛冠军进行最后冲刺。桑切斯如能再度荣膺最佳射手，就会成为西班牙足球史上的最优秀得分手。以往，只有斯特法诺五次获此殊荣，但并没有蝉联。
