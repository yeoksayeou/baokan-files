Tonight, the nightingales sing. The birds chirp endlessly on the hillside forest strip in front of the village.

"Wasteland—wasteland—" The four directions are silent, and the call echoes far and wide.

Is it singing about the desolate beauty of the hills? Is it lamenting the vastness of the north? I am not sure about its mournful and beautiful call, nor am I sure about its melancholic and cool melody. I just listen quietly.

The summer night sky is clear and high, and the tranquil dome of the sky is adorned with mysterious blue brilliance. The countryside appears peaceful, satisfied, and serene. The moonlight is beautiful, and the soft moonlight gently illuminates the distant mountains and flows into the nearby forest. The forest strip, which appears in various shades of green during the day—dark green, yellow-green, deep green, light green—still has distinct layers. The fragrant grass is lush, and the mountain peonies in the wild at night exude a wild fragrance...

The barren beauty of the hills, the gentle tones. I do not know how I left my old home, nor do I know how I walked up the hill along this milky white path. Tonight, I want to find the nightingale. Will I find it?

"Wasteland—wasteland—" The nightingale calls, and it sounds very beautiful. I lie on my back on the grass, listening to the nightingale's clear and mournful cries. If I were to pitch a white tent on this green hillside and listen, I think it would be more elegant. But now, seeking it like this makes one more intoxicated.

Suddenly, I remember my father's mysterious voice: "That bird, it sings most at night..." Unable to resist our group of children's persistent questions, he sat down on the edge of the kang, "That bird, it often stays in the bushes, and it is very agile, making it hard to spot. At that time, there were only young trees here. That day, the sky was very gloomy, and the forest was dark. I was herding sheep, and that thing started calling in the bushes, perhaps thinking it was night. I followed the sound and went quietly, shh, the thing had a reddish-brown upper body and a light brown lower body. Before I could see it clearly, it flew away with a 'tier' sound..."

With a "tier" sound, it flew away. I, with my long childhood romantic yearning, left the mountains and then, with the longing of a traveler, returned from afar. I have carefully and seriously flipped through zoology books and have sincerely discussed with a northern migratory bird expert about this bird that is widespread in Central Asia and active in northern China during the summer. I know it is the nightingale, and that is the call of the nightingale.

A pleasant breeze blows over the hillside, the leaves rustle gently, and the long-awaited nightingale's call is deep and prolonged. Now, the long-awaited milky white mist is slowly rising, and the dense and sparse forest gradually becomes hazy and indistinct, like a faint watercolor painting. The countryside appears even more cool and wonderful. I quietly tread lightly, approaching that tall old apricot tree. I am sure it is on some branch of that old apricot tree. Is it hanging upside down, with blood dripping from its nostrils, as people say?!

The call suddenly stopped. I looked at it with admiration and envy. You, this cunning and agile little bird, I will soon find you in your beautiful posture singing under the moonlight. Suddenly, there was a rustling sound in the dense green leaves, followed by a "tier" sound, and a vague and faint little thing, like a thread, instantly disappeared into the dim and dark distance! I was confused and felt a sense of loss. The beautiful, gentle night, the nightingale's clear and mournful cries in the night, is this just a fragment of a picture I have longed for and yearned for for many years? Is this just an alluring illusion I have sought for many years? I felt my childlike sincerity suddenly vanish. It seemed as if everything was spinning...

I sadly sang the song "The Nightingale" arranged by Tchaikovsky: "My little nightingale, little nightingale, with a clear voice, little nightingale! Where do you fly? Where do you sing all night?"

The countryside began to fill with dark shadows. Only the melody of my song lingered slowly. Little nightingale, where will you sing tomorrow night?!

　　月夜，夜莺声声
　　史小溪
    今夜，夜莺声声。那鸟儿无休止地在村前那片山坡林带婉啭鸣唱。
    “荒岗——荒岗——”四野寂然，叫声传得很远。
    它是歌唱荒芜美丽的山岗么？是咏叹北方的辽阔空旷么？我拿不准它那凄婉优美的鸣叫，拿不准它那忧伤清凉的韵音。只是静静谛听着。
    初夏的夜空，明朗高远，静谧苍穹点缀着幽蓝奇妙的辉煌。山野显得安宁、满足和坦然。月色很美，皎洁的月光柔和地耀出远山的轮廓，流进眼前的林子。那林带白天看上去的墨绿、黄绿、浓绿、浅绿，依然层次各异。芳草青青，山丹丹在夜间的野地上放肆地喷吐着芳香……
    荒美的山岗，温柔的色调。我不知是怎样离开故居的，不知是怎样沿着这乳白色的小路走上山坡的。今夜，我要寻找夜莺，我会寻到它么？
    “荒岗——荒岗——”夜莺叫着，很好听。我仰卧在草地上，听夜莺一声一声清婉的啼诉。如果在这碧绿的山坡上搭起白色的帐篷谛听，我想，也许更优雅些。但现在这样去寻觅，更使人沉醉。
    我忽然想起父亲那神秘的声音：“那鸟儿，多鸣叫于月夜……”父亲经不住我们一群孩子的缠问，往炕沿一盘腿，“那鸟儿，常在林丛间，动作又极灵活，不易窥见。那时，这里尽是梢林，那日天阴沉得厉害，林子很暗，我放羊，那东西竟在林丛叫起来，许是以为天黑了呢。我寻声悄悄而去，嘘，那东西上体赤褐，下体淡棕色，还未看清楚，它‘忒儿’一声就飞了……”
    “忒儿”一声飞了。我带着童年长长的浪漫的憧憬，从大山走了出去又带着游子长长的亲切的思念从远方走了回来。我曾仔细而认真地翻阅过动物学，曾虔诚地和一位北方候鸟专家探讨过这种遍布于中亚细亚，夏季活动于我国北方的鸟儿。我知道它就是夜莺，那是夜莺的叫声。
    山坡吹过愉快的和风，树叶轻轻摇着，久违了的夜莺声深切而悠长。现在，等待已久的乳白色的雾霭轻悠悠地升起来，浓淡疏密的林子渐次迷离朦胧，宛若一幅淡泊的水墨画。山野更显得清凉，美妙。我悄悄踏着轻步，向那棵高大的老杏树靠近。我肯定它就在那老杏树的什么树丫上，是像人说的倒悬着、鼻孔滴着血的叫么？！
    叫声戛然停了。我喜爱地欣羡地望着，你这狡黠机灵的小鸟，我会很快寻觅见你在这月光下鸣叫的优美姿态的。突然，蓊郁的绿叶间一阵簌簌的响动，接着“忒儿”一声，一个模糊而隐微的小东西，像一道线儿似的顿时消失在混沌昏暗的远方！我惶惑了，茫然若有所失。美丽的、温柔夜色中清婉啼啭的小夜莺，难道我多少年眷恋思念的只是这样一幅残缺的画么？难道我多少年追求寻觅的只是这样一幅诱惑人的虚无的幻影？我觉得我的童心一样的赤诚一下消失殆尽。仿佛，一切在旋转……
    我忧郁地唱起奥勃彼尔改编的《夜莺》：“我的小夜莺，小夜莺，歌声嘹亮的小夜莺！你向哪儿飞翔？整夜你在哪儿歌唱？”
    山野开始弥漫上黛黑色的阴影。只有我的歌声的旋律在徐缓地延宕。小夜莺啊，明晚你又会在哪儿歌唱？！
