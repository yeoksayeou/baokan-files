According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong on April 1st, Taipei news: Elderly Taiwanese citizen Wu Wenhai, who suffers from hemiplegia, with a gastric tube inserted and seated in a wheelchair, set off on March 31st to return to Jiangxi to visit his wife, who he has not seen in 42 years and is blind.

This year, 72-year-old Wu Wenhai went to Taiwan alone 42 years ago, leaving his wife and daughter in his father-in-law's home in Yiyang, Jiangxi. It was only two years ago that he received news of his wife and daughter. His wife, due to missing her husband and crying too much, lost her sight a few years ago. Wu Wenhai also suffered a stroke and is paralyzed, unable to speak. Fellow Hebei natives and friends saw him off. Wu Wenhai was so moved that he wept bitterly. He used his index finger to write down his thoughts: "I am grateful to my wife for her hard work over the past 42 years in raising our daughter to adulthood," "I love her, I miss her, and I am grateful to her."

　　半身不遂老台胞　启程返乡探盲妻
    据新华社香港４月１日电  台北消息：身患半身不遂的老台胞吴文海插着胃管，坐上轮椅，３月３１日启程返江西探望４２年未见面、双目失明的妻子。
    今年７２岁的吴文海４２年前只身赴台，留下妻子和女儿在江西弋阳岳丈家中，直到两年前才得知妻女的音讯。他妻子因思念丈夫流泪过多，数年前双目失明。吴文海也中风偏瘫，不能言语。河北同乡会及朋友们为他送行，吴文海激动得痛哭流涕，他用食指写下了心里话：“我感谢太太辛苦４２年，将女儿抚养成人”，“我爱她，思念她，感谢她”。
