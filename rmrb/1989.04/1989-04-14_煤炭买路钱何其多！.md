Title: The High Cost of Coal Transportation Fees

In recent years, coal prices have been rising repeatedly, causing enterprises to complain bitterly. Not long ago, reporters in the "coal capital" of Shanxi learned that the reason coal prices are so high is not just due to the "coal broker" markup, but also because the transportation fees during the process are approximately 2.5 times the price of coal itself, while the price in Shanghai, the destination, is 6.5 times higher.

According to relevant departments, the pithead price of coal in Shanxi Province was only about 10 yuan per ton in the past, but it was raised to around 20 yuan per ton by August of last year. After being transported and loaded onto trains, the price is 33.8 yuan per ton. Whether it is within the plan or outside the plan, the price remains the same. Why, then, does the market price of out-of-plan coal in some destination areas reach hundreds of yuan per ton?

Last October, a joint investigation by the Shanxi Provincial Coal Bureau, Shanxi Provincial Finance Bureau, and other units shed some light on the issue. Taking the example of ordinary coal transported from Jinsha Beach Station in Shanxi's Yanbei Region to Shanghai via Qinhuangdao, the price at Jinsha Beach Station when loaded onto the train was 33.8 yuan per ton. However, upon arrival in Shanghai, the selling price reached 170 yuan, more than four times the loading price. A ton of coal transported from Shanxi to Shanghai incurs various "transportation fees" along the way, totaling 20 identifiable items. Within Shanxi Province, fees include loading fees, dedicated line maintenance fees, water resource fees, insurance fees, service fees, miscellaneous fees, energy base construction funds, and others, totaling 8 items and 23.18 yuan. The railway system collects fees such as railway transportation fees, vehicle pickup and delivery fees, railway measures fees, management fees, and others, totaling 4 items and 29.54 yuan. Qinhuangdao Port collects water transportation fees and port fees, totaling 2 items and 11.20 yuan. Shanghai collects port fees, loading and unloading fees, storage fees, port construction fees, short-distance transportation fees, electronic weighing fees, and others, totaling 6 items and 7.25 yuan. Additionally, there is a loss fee of 3.77 yuan. These identifiable "transportation fees" total 71.34 yuan.

Relevant personnel pointed out that while these numerous transportation fees have some reasonable components, the transportation costs of coal being much higher than the price of coal itself is unreasonable. Producers have no profit to be made, and even incur losses. If this continues, how can China's coal industry develop?

However, the coal price plus transportation fees is only 105.14 yuan. Compared to the selling price of 170 yuan, there is a difference of 64.86 yuan. The investigation did not yield results, and when Shanghai Municipal Fuel Company was asked for an explanation, the response was: "We cannot disclose that. Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to buy high-priced coal!" Not answering is also a clear answer, indicating that the difference is used for undisclosed "transportation fees."

### 煤炭买路钱何其多！

　　煤炭买路钱何其多！
    近年来，煤炭价格一涨再涨，企业叫苦不迭。前不久，记者在“煤都”山西了解到，煤炭价格所以昂贵，除“煤倒”加价外，在运输过程中的买路钱大约高于煤价本身２．５倍，而销地上海的价格则高出６．５倍。
    据有关方面介绍，山西省的煤炭坑口价格过去每吨仅有１０多元，到去年８月之后才提高到２０元左右，经过集运，上火车的价格也才３３．８元１吨，不论是计划内的，还是计划外的均是这个价。为什么运到一些销地后计划外煤炭的市场价格竟能卖到１００好几到２００元呢？
    去年１０月，山西省煤炭厅、山西省财政厅等单位进行的一次联合调查很能说明问题。以从山西省雁北地区金沙滩发站经由秦皇岛运往上海的计划外普通煤炭为例，在金沙滩发煤站上火车的价格为每吨３３．８元，而到上海后的销售价竟高达１７０元，比上火车的价格高出了４倍多。一吨煤炭从山西运到上海，一路上不断以各种名目收取“买路钱”，数得上来的就有２０项。山西省境内收的费用有装车费、专用线维修费、水资源费、保险费、服务费、运杂费、能源基地建设资金等８项共计２３．１８元；铁路系统收的费用有铁路运输费、取送车费、铁路措施费、管理费等４项共计２９．５４元；秦皇岛港收的费用有水运费、港口费等两项共计１１．２０元；上海收取的费用有上港费、装卸船费、堆存费、建港费、短途运费、电子衡费等６项共计７．２５元；此外还有损耗费３．７７元。这一项一项可算明的“买路钱”共计７１．３４元。
    有关人士指出，这些名目繁多的买路钱，不乏其合理部分，但是，煤炭的运输费用大大高于煤炭的本身价格是不合理的。生产者无利可图，甚至亏损，如此下去，我国的煤炭事业怎么能发展。
    然而，煤价加运输费也只有１０５．１４元，这同１７０元的售价相比，还有６４．８６元的差价到哪儿去了。调查没有着落，请上海市燃料公司作点介绍，得到的回答是：“无可奉告。要不我们连高价煤也买不到了！”没有回答，也等于是明确回答了，差价是用在不敢公开名目的“买路钱”上了。
