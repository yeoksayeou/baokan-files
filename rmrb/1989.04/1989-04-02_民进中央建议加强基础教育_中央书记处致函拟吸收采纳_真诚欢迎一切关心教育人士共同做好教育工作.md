The Central Secretariat of the Communist Party of China sent a letter on March 29 to the Central Committee of the China Democratic League of China, praising their proposal titled "Several Suggestions on Effectively Implementing the 'Compulsory Education Law' and Strengthening Basic Education." The proposal offers many valuable insights on educational work.

In the letter, the Central Secretariat of the Communist Party of China stated that the Central Committee will soon convene a meeting to discuss educational issues. Some important suggestions from the Central Committee of the China Democratic League will be adopted in the draft documents of the Central Committee. Some suggestions will be forwarded to the State Council to instruct the State Education Commission to study them carefully during the implementation of the "Compulsory Education Law."

The Central Secretariat expressed in the letter that it sincerely welcomes the China Democratic League and other democratic parties, as well as all individuals who care about education, to work together with the Communist Party to improve educational work.

The suggestions from the Central Committee of the China Democratic League were submitted to the Central Secretariat of the Communist Party of China on March 8. They suggested that all levels of leadership, especially the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council, should further implement the strategic decision of "education is the foundation of a hundred-year plan" and adhere to the principle of "economic development must be preceded by education development, and education development must be preceded by basic education development." They emphasized that it is not acceptable to pursue only short-term economic benefits while neglecting the long-term benefits of education.

The suggestions emphasized that all levels of government should administer education according to law, and all levels of judicial departments should fulfill their legal responsibilities as stipulated in the "Compulsory Education Law." They should impose penalties on illegal behaviors such as employing school-age children and adolescents, refusing to send children to school on time, and forcing children to drop out of school midway.

The suggestions also proposed that the state should prioritize investment in basic education, rather than treating it as a residual matter. They suggested improving teachers' remuneration to stabilize the teaching staff, taking effective measures to strengthen moral education, deepening educational reforms, and striving to improve educational quality.

The suggestions from the Central Committee of the China Democratic League were proposed under the initiative of Lei Jieqiong, the chairperson of the China Democratic League. Lei Jieqiong discovered through multiple investigations that since the "Compulsory Education Law" was promulgated more than two years ago, many important provisions have not been effectively implemented, and many regions have not seriously executed them. Improving the social status of teachers and their material benefits still lacks effective specific measures. The situation of students dropping out of school to work has become increasingly serious, and the legal rights of many children and adolescents to receive compulsory education have not been effectively guaranteed. At the beginning of last year, the Central Committee of the China Democratic League issued a notice, requiring all levels of the China Democratic League and its members to conduct a serious investigation into the issue of basic education. In less than half a year, the Central Committee of the China Democratic League received more than 60 investigation reports from various places. After more than a year of extensive investigation and in-depth research, the suggestions from the Central Committee of the China Democratic League were formed.

In the reply letter, the Central Secretariat of the Communist Party of China hoped that all democratic parties would continue to play an active role in political participation and democratic supervision, jointly improve the system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party and the system of political consultation, and strive to maintain China's stable and united political situation, and to do a good job in various tasks of rectification and deepening reform.

    民进中央建议加强基础教育  中央书记处致函拟吸收采纳
　　真诚欢迎一切关心教育人士共同做好教育工作
    新华社北京４月１日电  （记者池茂花、邹爱国）中共中央书记处３月２９日致函中国民主促进会中央，赞扬他们提出的《关于切实贯彻〈义务教育法〉，加强基础教育的几点建议》，对教育工作提出了许多好的意见。
    中共中央书记处在致函中说，中共中央不久将召开会议讨论教育问题，民进中央在建议中的一些重要意见在中共中央拟议的文件中将予以吸收、采纳；有些意见将转请国务院责成国家教委在贯彻《义务教育法》中认真研究。
    中央书记处在致函中表示，真诚欢迎民进及其他民主党派和一切关心教育的人士，同中共一道把教育工作做好。
    民进中央的建议是３月８日向中共中央书记处提出的。他们建议，各级领导特别是中共中央和国务院要进一步把“百年大计，教育为本”的战略决策认真落实到行动上，坚持“经济要发展，教育要先行；教育要发展，基础教育要先行”的原则，决不能只追求经济的近期效益，而忽视教育的长远效益。
    建议强调，各级政府要依法治教，各级司法部门要负起对《义务教育法》所承担的执法职责，对招用适龄儿童、少年就业和拒送子女按时入学、强迫子女中途辍学等违法行为给予制裁。
    建议还提出，国家对基础教育的投入必须实行“优先原则”，而不是“剩余原则”；要提高教师待遇，稳定师资队伍；要采取有力措施，加强德育工作；要深化教育改革，努力提高教育质量。
    民进中央的建议，是在民进中央主席雷洁琼的倡导下提出的。雷洁琼在多次调查中发现，《义务教育法》颁行两年多来，许多重要规定尚未得到切实贯彻，有相当多的地区并未认真执行；提高教师的社会地位，改善教师的物质待遇，仍缺乏有效的具体措施；中小学生弃学就业情况越来越严重，许多儿童、少年接受义务教育的权利没有得到法律的切实保障。去年年初，民进中央发出通知，要求民进各级组织和民进会员就基础教育问题开展一次认真调查。在不到半年的时间里，民进中央收到各地的调查报告６０多份。经过一年多的广泛调查和深入研究，民进中央的这份建议才得以形成。
    中共中央书记处在复函中希望各民主党派继续在参政议政和民主监督方面积极发挥作用，共同完善共产党领导的多党合作制度和政治协商制度，为维护我国安定团结的政治局面，搞好治理整顿和深化改革的各项工作而努力。
