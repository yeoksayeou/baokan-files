The relationship between economic forms and culture is multifaceted.

A commodity economy is a high-culture economy. This is fundamentally different from a natural economy or a semi-natural economy. A natural economy is a low-level, closed economic system that relies on experience rather than cultural science. It even rejects cultural science. A commodity economy, on the other hand, is competitive and open. Ultimately, commodity competition is a contest of cultural science. The quality of commodities and the level of business management can both be seen as manifestations of culture. Therefore, the rapid development of a commodity economy necessarily requires a corresponding surge in cultural science, and a commodity economy can also become a powerful driving force for the development of cultural science, creating conditions for its advancement.

Some people believe that the commodity economy has led to the resurgence of a "new theory of the uselessness of reading." However, just as some people in our country are abandoning education to engage in commerce and abandoning school to engage in commerce, some developed countries are experiencing a boom in enterprises establishing schools and conducting research. It is not difficult to discern which phenomenon reflects the essential requirements of a commodity economy.

The "new theory of the uselessness of reading" has no necessary connection with the development of a commodity economy. It is precisely the product of an underdeveloped commodity economy where competition has not yet formed, and it is the product of low-culture management that does not adapt to the development of a commodity economy.

For example, in conducting business, developed countries require applicants to pass examinations in economics, law, and related technologies before they can be granted permission to operate. In our country, however, the issuance of business licenses still has no cultural requirements. In some places, enterprises are contracted out to whoever offers the highest profit target, resulting in the bold often winning out over the knowledgeable.

Another example is the optimization of labor combinations, where there are no specific cultural qualifications for "optimization." Some units simply contract the total number of positions, and reducing a few people means sealing the door, even preventing college graduates from being assigned.

All of these can be called low-culture management. They vividly illustrate that knowledge is "useless." The "new theory of the uselessness of reading" is merely a reflection of these social phenomena. The trend of disdain for learning spreads in schools, but the source of the problem lies outside the schools. Overcoming the "new theory of the uselessness of reading" is not just the responsibility of the educational sector; it is a matter for the entire society, especially for leaders and management personnel at all levels. Those who manage the economy must expand their vision beyond the economy, learn to manage the commodity economy according to the laws of the commodity economy, and adapt high-culture management to the development of a high-culture economy. We are confident: culture is the economy of tomorrow; only by mastering culture can one truly master the economy.

### 高文化经济与低文化管理

　　高文化经济与低文化管理
　　周之良
    经济形态同文化的关系是多样的。
    商品经济是高文化经济。这是与自然经济、半自然经济根本不同的。自然经济是低水平的、封闭式的经济，它依靠的是经验，而不是文化科学，它甚至是排斥文化科学的。商品经济是竞争的、开放式的经济。商品竞争归根结底是文化科学之争。商品的质量、经营管理的水平，都可以说是文化的显现。因此，商品经济的大发展必然要求文化科学与之相应地同步高涨，而且商品经济也必然能够成为文化科学发展的强大动力，并为文化科学的发展创造条件。
    有人以为是商品经济导致了“新的读书无用论”泛起。然而正当我国不断有人弃教从商、弃学从商之时，一些发达国家兴起企业办学、办科研的热潮。人们不难分辨，哪一种现象反映着商品经济的本质要求？
    “新的读书无用论”与发展商品经济并无必然联系。它恰恰是商品经济不发达、竞争尚未形成的产物，是不适应商品经济发展的低文化管理的产物。
    例如经商，在发达国家要对申请经商者进行经济、法律和有关技术的考试，考试合格者才有可能获准经营。而我国审批执照至今无文化方面的要求。有些地方承包企业，也是谁包的利润指标高就由谁来包，结果往往是胆大者取胜，外行挤掉了内行。
    又如优化劳动组合，对“优化”并无文化素质方面的具体要求，有的单位只是包了编制总额，裁减几个人就把大门封死，连大学生也分配不进去。
    凡此种种，都可以叫做低文化管理。它形象地表明知识是“无用”的。“新的读书无用论”不过是这种社会现象的折射。厌学风蔓延在学校，风源却在校外。克服“新的读书无用论”决不仅仅是教育界的事，它是全社会的事，尤其是各级领导和管理工作者的事。管理经济的，要把视野扩展到经济之外，学会按照商品经济的规律管理商品经济，以高文化的管理适应高文化的经济发展。我们确信：文化是明天的经济；掌握了文化才算真正掌握了经济。
