Morning Light

For many years, a sleepless lamp has accompanied me through the long nights. Because I go to bed late, the morning light often disappoints me.

A vibrant mood wanders in the morning light, but that is a very late occurrence.

A friend advised me that a day of hard work and fatigue will quickly disappoint life. Thus, a shiny silver sword, carrying the deep affection of my life, leaps in the moonlight. The moon in the morning is distant yet close, the sky in the morning is profound and mysterious. Gazing at the moonlight, it is meaningful, clear and bright, like the purity of my heart. The gentle morning breeze is calm and joyful, soft and uplifting, like the tenderness of my heart. Joining the group of life in the morning light is undoubtedly a deep call. Fathers and mothers in their forties, fifties, and sixties come from the morning light, drawing their swords with a "swish" and "swish." Thus, a moment of life shines brightly.

"Begin the posture—" he shouted loudly. Instantly, dozens of weary, gaunt, dim, and aged eyes shone brightly like the beauty of spring. Do not ask about their age, for life is moving at this moment. The vigorous and powerful swordplay in the morning light, the graceful and elegant movements under the stars and moon, are all efforts to keep life from fading away. At this moment, you only feel that the morning light is like a comfortable and flowing river, surging with the call of life. The full waves of light are overflowing, and you can immerse yourself in it, swim in it. The secrets of youth and life are all within it.

Leading the group is a woman. She shouts loudly and leads the group. She is 55 years old, originally a textile worker, spending 40 years weaving in colorful warp and weft. Her youth turned into the fibers of countless bolts of fabric, flowing like an ocean of colors in her life. She has aged in this colorful ocean. Now, she has retired, and this soft morning light belongs to her...

Tai Chi sword, three-section sword, stage sword, Emei sword... The silver sword dances in the moonlight. The morning light turns into the liveliness and vitality of her life. Only at this moment does she do what she wants to do, and she is as elegant as she should be. I know that when the morning light fades, she will go home to take care of her 90-year-old mother and look after her two-year-old and three-year-old grandchildren...

The winter without leaves is deep and vast. In the morning light, the orange streetlights gradually fade. The first bus starts, the first person finishing the night shift walks out of the factory gate, the first child going to school early, with a book bag, sets off... The silver swords on the open ground in the woods are still shining.

"We women, even in old age, do not get to rest..." said the mother who came from Wudang Mountain. "Only the morning light understands our years." She is the wife of an old political commissar who has fought in the south and north. She has aged loving and youth for her husband and children. Now, she has aged white hair for her twin grandchildren who were just born. She said that she has to be back home by 7:30 AM to take care of the children so that her daughter and son-in-law can go to work on time. However, at this moment, she is fully enjoying the morning light, making her life vigorous and spirited...

Yes, when the morning light fades and the morning stars dim and fall, this group—those masters full of vitality, the retired female teacher who sincerely and kindly makes sword tassels for others by unraveling nylon curtain strings, the plump aunt who brings a tape recorder every day to play music so that people can dance to disco aerobics... How will they welcome the troubles and burdens of life with such passion? To buy vegetables? To cook? To take care of children? To take care of a paralyzed husband or a bedridden wife? Fate is not easy for them, and time is like a book, thickly bound with their misfortune and hardship. Thus, they use the life force from the depths of their hearts to silence the outside world's various opinions, using the morning light without complaints and regrets to overcome the suffering of the soul, to overcome the fatigue of life, to show the beauty and longing of life, and to soothe the soul in the morning light.

"Turn back to look at the moon—" the master calls out loudly. Thus, dozens of silver swords "swish" and slash behind their backs, lifting their legs and crawling, like "a phoenix spreading its wings," like "a swallow taking flight." Like poetry and painting, like a dream and the ethereal morning light, what great motivation and inspiration it gives to fathers and mothers, tranquility and peace.

Ah, may the everlasting morning light, the morning light without troubles and disturbances, forever belong to the hearts of fathers and mothers, to the sincere existence of life, to the heavy and noble life.

　　晨光
　　梅洁
    多少年了，不眠的灯，伴我渡过长夜。因为睡得晚，晨光便每每地辜负。
    勃勃的心境潇潇于晨光之中，那是很晚很晚的事了。
    朋友忠告我，终日的伏案，终日的疲惫，会很快辜负生活。于是，一把闪闪亮亮的银剑，携带我生命的挚情，跃动在晨月下。晨的月亮遥远又很近，晨的天空深邃而神秘。仰首月光，意味深长，明净而莹白，似我心的纯稚。缕缕的晨风，安然愉悦，温柔而轻托，似我心的缠绵。挚着地加入晨光中生命的一群，那自是一种深沉的召唤。四十岁、五十岁、六十岁的父亲母亲们从晨光中走来，“嗖”“嗖”地拔剑出鞘，于是，生命的一刹那闪闪耀耀。
    “起势——”他嘹亮地喊。于是，几十双疲惫的、憔悴的、昏花的、衰老的眸光一瞬间闪灼如春的美丽。不要问他们的年龄，生命在这一刻是动人的青春。那晨光中舞剑的磅礴激健，那星月下的潇洒妩媚，都是生命不肯消逝的努力。此时此刻，你只感这晨光似一条适意而流动的河，涌动着生命的召唤，那满满的波光流溢，你尽可以没入其中，泅于其中，青春和生命的秘密尽在其中。
    领头的是一位妇女，她嘹亮地喊，嘹亮地做“首领”。她５５岁，原是一位纺织女工，４０年都在彩色经纬里穿梭，青春化做经纬里的根根纤维，千匹万匹的花色布海洋般在她生命的过程里流淌，她也在彩色海洋里老去。如今，她退休了，这溶溶晨光才属于她……太极剑、三合剑、舞台剑、峨嵋剑……银色剑旋舞在莹莹的月下，晨光化做她生命的生动与活泼。只有在此刻，她做着她想做的一切，她潇洒着她应该有的潇洒。我知道，晨光褪去，她就回家照顾９０高龄的老母，看护两岁三岁的孙子……
    落了叶的冬很深很坦荡，晨光里，桔色路灯渐渐淡去。第一辆公共汽车起程了，第一个干完夜班的人走出厂门，第一个上早学的孩子背着书包，上路了……林间空地上的银剑还在闪耀。
    “我们做女人的，到老也不得消闲……”武当山下走来的那位母亲说，“只有晨光懂得我们的岁月。”她是南征北战的老政委的妻子，一生为丈夫、为儿女操老了爱和青春。如今，她又为两个刚刚生下的一对孪生外孙操白了一头灰发。她说，她每日要在７时３０分赶回家看孩子，好让女儿女婿准时上班。然而此刻，她却尽意地在晨光里让生命意气风发……
    是的，当晨光褪去，晨星淡了落了，他们这一群——那蓬蓬生机的男的女的师傅，那虔诚而充满善意的拆了尼龙绳门帘为他人制做剑穗的退休女教师，那每日里提来收录机放音乐好让人们跳迪斯科健美舞的胖嫂……他们将以怎样的豪情去迎接生活的烦恼和沉重？去买菜？去做饭？去看护孩子？去伺候瘫痪的丈夫或病卧的妻子？命运对于他们并不轻松，岁月如一本书，厚厚地装订着他们的不幸和劳苦。于是，他们以发自内心的生命力量使外界的众说纷纭平息下去，用无怨无悔的晨光去战胜心灵的苦难，战胜生活的疲惫，去昭示人生的美和向往，灵魂在晨光里得到平衡和抚慰。
    “回头望月——”师傅在嘹亮地召唤。于是，几十把银色剑“嗖”地劈向身的后方，抬腿匍匐，如“大鹏展翅”，如“紫燕起飞”。如诗如画，如梦幻如飘渺的晨光赋予父亲母亲们何等伟大的冲动和感召，宁静与和平。
    啊，愿生生不息的晨光，无苦事无纷扰的晨光，永远属于父亲母亲们的心灵、属于生活真诚的存在，属于沉重而崇高的人生。
