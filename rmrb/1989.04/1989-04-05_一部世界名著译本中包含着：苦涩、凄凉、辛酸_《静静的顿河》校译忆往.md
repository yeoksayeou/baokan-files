A classic translation contains bitterness, desolation, and heartache. Memories of editing "And Quiet Flows the Don"

In the early 1960s, the renowned translator of the older generation, Jin Ren, directly translated Maxim Gorky's historical epic "The Life of Klim Samgin" from Russian into Chinese. The first three volumes were published consecutively. At that time, I was undergoing "supervised labor" in a factory. In the evenings, to pass the time and learn, I bought these three volumes and read them carefully, comparing them with the original text. Over approximately a year, I finished proofreading them. I learned a lot, but I also discovered many issues in the translation that were worth discussing. I made notes on these issues, categorized them, and sent my suggestions for revisions to the People's Literature Publishing House to be forwarded to Jin Ren.

Soon, I received his reply. He humbly said that my questions and suggestions for revisions were very pertinent, and he had obtained the publisher's approval to withdraw the manuscript of the fourth volume, which was in the process of being typeset, and intended to ask me to proofread it before it was printed again. I replied that I was willing to assist. After that, the personnel departments of both parties began negotiations for a temporary transfer. However, despite the fact that I had already "returned to the ranks of the people," I was still considered a "controlled object," so the negotiations continued until the "unprecedented" Cultural Revolution, and the matter was dropped.

This was my "literary exchange" with Jin Ren. We exchanged many letters, and we both lived in Beijing, but neither of us ever suggested meeting in person. From this, I already sensed that his political situation was probably also quite dire. During the Cultural Revolution, I indeed saw articles criticizing and exposing him in the "reports" from the publishing house's "rebels," knowing that he had been demoted to another category and was a "key figure." Later, I heard that he unfortunately passed away during the turmoil.

In the spring of 1984, I was unexpectedly tasked with proofreading Jin Ren's translation of "And Quiet Flows the Don," giving me the opportunity to search for materials related to "And Quiet Flows the Don" from books and publications that had survived the Cultural Revolution. The original text and the translation had long been taken by the Red Guards, leaving only the cards made from old calendars at that time. Reflecting on the past, I was filled with emotion.

Mikhail Sholokhov's Major Revisions to "And Quiet Flows the Don"

Mikhail Sholokhov wrote "And Quiet Flows the Don" between 1926 and 1940 and made three major revisions to it, in 1953, 1964, and 1980. The 1953 version was entirely a product of the Stalin phenomenon. The author, in order to appease Stalin and his official critics, reluctantly made extensive revisions to the original version, adding, deleting, and changing over three hundred places, and even inserting Stalin's name into the book, placing him alongside Lenin.

After the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the political situation in the Soviet Union changed abruptly, and the literary world saw a "thaw." Thus, Sholokhov made extensive revisions to the 1953 version, removing Stalin's name and almost all the reluctant changes, basically restoring the original appearance of the first edition. This is the 1964 version. The 1980 version is the author's final revision of "And Quiet Flows the Don" before his death, making only a few minor changes to the 1964 version.

About the Old and New Translations

Jin Ren's translation from the 1940s was based on the first edition. Due to the Anti-Japanese War, the White Terror, and the lack of necessary reference books and materials, translating such a long epic inevitably had various shortcomings. This translation was published continuously until 1951, with a total of eight editions.

In 1956, the People's Literature Publishing House published a new version of "And Quiet Flows the Don," which was Jin Ren's revised translation based on the 1953 Russian new edition. Soviet expert on Sholokhov, Konstantin Preobrazhensky, considered the 1953 version to be the "dark age" or "stain" in the entire creative and publishing history of "And Quiet Flows the Don." The author himself also detested it, but this version was the only one in China for 30 years. Most of the older generation of readers and researchers in China used this version.

This time, I proofread based on the 1964 edition published by Izvestia Publishing House and referred to the 1953 edition by the Soviet State Literature Publishing House, the 1980 selection edition by Pravda Publishing House, and the English translation by Stephen Garry published by the Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House.

The new version's translations of character names are all based on the "Handbook of Russian Name Transliteration" (Commercial Press edition). However, considering some main characters, such as Grigory, Aksinya, Stepan, Natalia, Mokhov, and the father and son Listnitsky, whose names are already very familiar and commonly used among Chinese readers and in many monographs on "And Quiet Flows the Don," I retained the original names for these families, only changing a few rare characters, such as "婀."

Unfortunately, Jin Ren could not see the new version that he had long hoped to publish one day.

　　一部世界名著译本中包含着：苦涩、凄凉、辛酸
    《静静的顿河》校译忆往
    贾刚
    我与金人    
    ６０年代初，著名的老一代翻译家金人直接从俄文译的高尔基的长篇历史巨著《克里姆·萨姆金的一生》一、二、三部，相继出版。那时我正在工厂接受“监督劳动”。晚上，为了消磨时间和学习，就买来这三部，对照原文，仔细阅读起来。在约一年的时间里校读完。我学到了很多东西，但也发现译文中存在的不少值得商榷的问题。我把它们制成卡片，分类整理出来并提出了修改意见，寄给人民文学出版社转金人。
    很快就收到他的回信。他很谦虚地说，我提出的问题及修改意见都很中肯，他已征得出版社的同意，把正在排印的第四部原稿抽回，拟请我校订后再排印。我回信表示愿意效劳。此后，便是双方单位人事部门办借调交涉了。哪里知道，我尽管已经“回到人民的队伍”，但仍属“控制使用对象”，所以一直交涉到“史无前例”的“文化大革命”，也就不了了之了。
    这就是我与金人的一场“文字之交”。我们通过很多信，而且都住在北京，但是谁都不曾提出过见面的愿望。由此我已经感觉到，他的政治处境大概也很不妙。“文革”中，我从出版社“造反派”的“战报”中果然看到批判揭发他的文章，知他已被打入另册，而且是“重点人物”。后又听说，他在动乱中不幸逝世。
    １９８４年春４月，我偶然受命校订金人译的《静静的顿河》，有机会从“文革”查抄幸存下来的书刊中寻觅与《静静的顿河》有关的资料。原文和译本当然早被红卫兵抄去，只剩下了当时用旧台历做的卡片。抚今思昔，不胜感慨。
    肖洛霍夫对《静静的顿河》的几次重大修改
    米哈伊尔·肖洛霍夫于１９２６—１９４０年间写成《静静的顿河》后，共进行过三次修改，即１９５３年、１９６４年和１９８０年版。其中１９５３年版完全是斯大林现象的产物。作家为了迎合斯大林及御用评论家的批评，取悦斯大林，违心地对初版进行了大规模的修改，增删改动多达三百余处，还把斯大林的名字硬塞进书中，与列宁并列。
    苏共“二十大”后，苏联的政治形势骤变，文坛出现了“解冻”现象。于是肖洛霍夫又对１９５３年版大加修改，删去了斯大林的名字和几乎全部违心的修改，基本上又恢复了初版的原貌，这就是１９６４年版。１９８０年版是作家生前对《静静的顿河》的最后一次修订，只对１９６４年版作了极个别的、细微的改动。
    关于旧译本和新译本
    金人的４０年代初的译本是根据初版译出的。由于抗日战争、白色恐怖和缺乏必要的工具书、参考资料，因而翻译这样的长篇巨著，译文中难免有这样或那样的缺点。这个译本一直刊行到１９５１年，先后出过八版。
    １９５６年人民文学出版社出版了新版的《静静的顿河》，这是金人根据１９５３年俄文新版改译的。苏联研究肖洛霍夫的专家康·普列玛认为１９５３年版是《静静的顿河》整个创作出版史上的“黑暗时代”或“污点”。作家本人对之也深恶痛绝，可是这个版本却在中国“独领风骚”达３０年之久。我国老一代的读者和研究者绝大部分用的都是这个版本。
    我这次校译根据的是１９６４年《消息报》出版社出版的本子，并参考了苏联国家文学出版社１９５３年版、《真理报》出版社１９８０年出版的选集本和莫斯科外文出版局出版的司蒂芬·加里的英译本。
    新版人物姓名的翻译均按《俄语姓名译名手册》（商务版）译出，但考虑到一些主要人物，如葛利高里、阿克西妮亚、司捷潘、娜塔莉亚、莫霍夫和利斯特尼茨基父子等的译名在我国读者与研究《静静的顿河》的诸多专著中，已非常熟悉和通用，所以这几个家族的成员都保留了原来的译名，只对个别罕见的字，如“婀”作了改动。
    遗憾的是金人已经不能看到他曾盼望“有朝一日”出版的新版本了。
