    Illegal and disciplinary violations in foreign trade links have been increasing. The customs authorities should strengthen macro-control.

    Xiamen, April 20 (Reported by Dai Yuqing and Liu Luyan) — Today, Dai Jie, Director of the General Administration of Customs, said at a meeting of customs directors from coastal regions held here: "Customs should further play its role in macro-control, in accordance with the national industrial policy, supporting the industries that the state emphasizes, and restricting the industries that the state needs to control."

    It is understood that since the rectification and adjustment last year, various illegal and disciplinary violations in import and export links have increased significantly. In the first quarter of this year, there were 346 cases of violations of permit management nationwide, and customs authorities have identified and rectified underreported prices totaling over 100 million yuan. This has made the task of strengthening macro-control by customs increasingly heavy.

    The customs directors attending the meeting reported that in recent months, some state-owned and private companies have evaded permit management and customs supervision through various channels, engaging in import and export trade that goes against macro-control. For example, although the state has implemented a permit system to restrict the export of whole corn and soybeans, some companies have ground corn and soybeans into "corn grits" and "soybean grits" for export.

    Dai Jie said that such phenomena are the main reasons for the macro-control failure of certain commodities in import and export.

    According to the directors, since this year, there has been an increase in the use of processing trade channels and non-trade channels to indirectly import and export products that the state prohibits or restricts. For this reason, the General Administration of Customs has formulated some new measures.

    In addition, strengthening anti-smuggling is also a major task for customs this year.

### 外贸环节违法违纪增多  海关应加强宏观监控

　　外贸环节违法违纪增多    
    海关应加强宏观监控
    本报厦门４月２０日电  记者戴玉庆、刘鲁燕报道：海关总署署长戴杰今天在此间召开的全国沿海海关关长汇报会上说：“海关要进一步发挥宏观监控职能，按照国家产业政策的要求，支持国家重点发展的行业，限制国家需要控制的行业。”
    据了解，自去年治理整顿以来，进出口环节中的各种违法、违纪行为明显增多。今年第一季度，全国违反许可证管理的案件达３４６起，海关查出低报价格补征税款１亿多元。这使海关加强宏观监控的任务日益加重。
    参加这次会议的海关关长介绍说：近几个月来，国内一些官办、民办公司通过多种渠道逃避许可证管理和海关监管，搞有悖于宏观控制的进出口贸易。例如，国家采取许可证制度限制出口整粒玉米、大豆，一些公司就把玉米、大豆碾碎，当作“玉米碎”、“大豆碎”出口。
    戴杰说，此类现象是造成某些商品进出口宏观失控的主要原因。
    据关长们分析，今年以来利用加工贸易渠道和非贸易渠道，变相进出口国家禁止或限制进出口产品的现象也有所上升。为此，海关总署已制订了一些新的措施。
    此外，加强缉私也是今年海关的一项主要任务。
