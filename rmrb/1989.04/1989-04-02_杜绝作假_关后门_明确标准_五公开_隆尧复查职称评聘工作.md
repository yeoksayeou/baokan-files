    Eliminate Fake Practices and "Backdoor" Connections: Clarify Standards with "Five Opens"
    Longyao Re-examines Professional Title Evaluations

    Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, April 1 - After a thorough re-examination, Longyao County in Hebei Province recently announced the cancellation of professional titles for 156 individuals. Among them, 3 held senior titles, 37 held intermediate titles, and 17 were county or bureau-level cadres. All issued appointment letters, contracts, and professional title salaries have been recalled. The general public has said: the irregularities in professional title demotions and reforms should have been addressed long ago.

    Due to the prevalence of falsifying certificates, fabricating academic credentials, and using connections to gain unfair advantages during the professional title reform, widespread dissatisfaction has arisen across various sectors of society. The Longyao County Party Committee and government have decided to overcome resistance and conduct a comprehensive re-examination of the county's professional title reform work. They established a powerful re-examination body, based on national regulations, and made 11 specific and clear provisions as the basis for the re-examination. At the same time, they changed the previous closed approach by implementing "five opens": open policy regulations, standards, individual application materials, public opinion surveys, and evaluation results. In the 32 county-level units with re-examination tasks, they set up suggestion boxes to allow the public to comment and supervise.

    Administrative leaders violating regulations to evaluate and appoint professional titles was a key focus of the re-examination. The county Party Committee and government also strictly followed the regulations, prompting 17 county and bureau-level cadres to voluntarily return their appointment letters, contracts, and salaries. Five transferred cadres have terminated their contracts with their original units.

　　杜绝作假“关后门”　明确标准“五公开”
    隆尧复查职称评聘工作
    本报石家庄４月１日电  河北省隆尧县经过认真复查，最近宣布取消１５６人的专业技术职称。其中，高级职称３人，中级职称３７人，县和局级领导干部１７人。发出的聘书、聘约和职称工资已全部收回。广大群众说：职称贬职和职改中的混乱现象早该抓抓了。
    由于职称改革中开假证明、弄假学历、拉关系、走后门等状况比较严重，引起社会各界的不满。隆尧县委、县政府下决心冲破阻力，对全县的职改工作进行一次全面复查。他们组成强有力的复查机构，根据国家有关规定，具体地作出１１条明确规定，作为复查的依据。同时一改过去的封闭状态，实行政策规定、标准、个人申报材料、民意测验、考评结果“五公开”。在县直３２个有复查任务的单位设立举报箱，让群众评议、监督。
    行政领导干部违犯规定评聘职称，是该县复查的一个重点。县委、县政府也严格按规定办事，促使１７名县和局级领导干部主动退回了聘书、聘约和工资，５名调动工作的领导干部与原单位解除了聘约。（陈国琦　赵贵生　范文俭）
