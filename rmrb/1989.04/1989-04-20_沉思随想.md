The back of a person often seems more appealing than the front, which is why good actors also have presence in their back. This is especially true for young women standing by a railing, gazing into the distance, poised and elegant. However, it is best not to have that “sudden turnaround”—lest the artistic imagination be lost.

In the 1950s, Guo Xiaochuan once advised young literary enthusiasts that some people pursue goals like a tile, others like a bowl, and still others like a large jar. Small vessels fill quickly, but your aspirations should be grand, and your knowledge and cultivation should be vast. This is indeed true.

But I think this is speaking of “universal rain.” If the “rainwater” in the “bowl” can overflow, but in the “jar” it is only a light drizzle and gradually stops?

Ah! The words warrior, lofty, and great.

However, warriors are vastly different from one another. The warriors in a victorious army advancing like a tide and those crawling forward under a hail of bullets are almost two different kinds of people.

True warriors, lofty and great warriors, often have a fate intertwined with “dying in battle.”

The happiness and suffering of intellectuals are dual. I think that during the Cultural Revolution, scholars, professors, writers, and other cultural professionals who could not bear the humiliation and committed suicide must have been more numerous and more tragic than those with purely political crimes.

Revolutionaries like Tian Jianying are, at their core, intellectuals, especially possessing the nature, character, and backbone of intellectuals.

“…My longing for tranquility has vanished. Now I know what I want to do, what I should do, and what I must do.” These are a few sentences from the passionate welcome speech by the German poet Heinrich Heine upon hearing of the outbreak of the July Revolution in France in 1830. Today’s essays should also not shirk the responsibility of enlightening people to ponder the mission of the times: what is “to do,” “should do,” and “must do.”

　　沉思随想
    人的背面似乎比人的正面更好看，所以好演员背部亦有戏。尤其是青年女子凭栏远眺、亭亭玉立。然而，最好不要那“蓦然回首”——以免使艺术想象失落。
    五十年代，郭小川曾对弄文学的青年讲，对追求，有的人是片瓦，有的人是只碗，有的人则是一口缸。器小益盈，你们的追求要远大，知识修养要恢宏。此言极是。
    但我以为，这是就“普天同雨”而言的。倘若“碗”之地的“雨水”可下到漫溢，而“缸”之地仅是“毛毛雨”，且“渐断”呢？
    啊！战士，多少崇高伟大的字眼。
    然而，战士与战士是大不相同的。那攻城略地之后潮水般前进的队伍中的战士和那冒着枪林弹雨匍匐前进的战士，几乎乃是两种人。
    真的战士，崇高伟大的战士，常常与“战死”的命运结缘。
    知识分子的幸福和痛苦，是双重的幸福和痛苦的。我想：“文革”中，因不堪凌辱而自杀的学者、教授、作家以及其他职业的文化人，一定要比较纯粹的其他罪名者为多，更为悲壮。
    田家英这类革命者，骨子里还是知识分子，尤其具有知识分子的秉性、性格和骨气。
    “……我对安静的渴望已经消逝。现在我又知道，我要做什么，应该做什么，必须做什么”。这是德国诗人海涅闻知一八三○年法国七月革命爆发后，所致热情洋溢的欢迎词中的几句话。今日之杂文，亦应不可推卸担当起启迪人们去思索这何为“要做”、“该做”、“必做”的时代使命的一部分。　　　　余英杰
