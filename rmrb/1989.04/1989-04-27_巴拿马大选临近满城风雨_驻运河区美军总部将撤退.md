The upcoming Panama elections are stirring up a storm. The government accuses the opposition of relying on U.S. funding for their campaigns; it is rumored that the U.S. will take more stringent measures against Panama. Meanwhile, the U.S. Southern Command headquarters in the Panama Canal Zone is preparing to withdraw.

According to reports from various newspapers in Mexico City, Panama is set to hold national elections on May 7. Various political factions are gearing up for a showdown. The presidential candidate supported by General Manuel Noriega, the military, and the government is Carlos Duque. The opposition Democratic Alliance for Civic Renewal has put forward Guillermo Endara as their presidential candidate. The Panamanian government accuses the opposition of receiving $10 million in campaign funding from the U.S. government. Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge Rittler called this "a disgrace for the Panamanian opposition." However, Guillermo Endara vehemently denied these allegations. Reports indicate that in recent days, rumors have been circulating in Panama City that if Noriega's candidate Duque wins the election, the U.S. will impose more severe sanctions on Panama. These sanctions could include a complete trade embargo, orchestrating a coup, or kidnapping Noriega. These rumors are not only spread by Panamanian media but also by some influential newspapers in the U.S. *U.S. News & World Report* stated that the Bush administration has instructed the CIA to allocate $10 million to prevent Duque from winning the election. *The New York Times* revealed that the Senate Intelligence Committee had previously blocked the Reagan administration's plan to stage a military coup in Panama. *The Washington Post* reported that the Reagan administration had allocated $1 million to establish an underground radio station in Panama.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Southern Command recently announced that as part of a "withdrawal operation," the headquarters will be relocated from Panama to a base within U.S. territory. The U.S. Southern Command has been stationed in the Panama Canal Zone since 1963, with jurisdiction extending from the southern border of Mexico to Tierra del Fuego.

　　巴拿马大选临近满城风雨  驻运河区美军总部将撤退
    本报墨西哥城４月２６日电  记者郭伟成报道：巴拿马大选临近满城风雨。政府指责反对派依靠美国资助参加竞选；据传美将对巴拿马采取更严厉措施。与此同时，驻巴拿马运河区的美国南方军总部部署撤退。
    据墨西哥城各报报道：巴拿马将于５月７日举行全国大选。各派政治力量准备进行一场较量。受到诺列加将军、国防军和政府当局支持的总统候选人是卡洛斯·杜克。反对派公民运动民主联盟推出吉列尔莫·恩达拉为总统候选人。巴拿马政府指责反对派接受了美国政府１０００万美元的竞选资助。巴拿马外长豪尔赫·里特尔说，这是“巴拿马反对派的耻辱。”但是，吉列尔莫·恩达拉断然否认了这一指责。据报道，近日来巴拿马城盛传，如果诺列加支持的杜克大选获胜，美国将对巴拿马采取更严厉的制裁措施。包括实行全面的贸易禁运；策动政变或者绑架诺列加。加入这些传言的不但有巴拿马的新闻媒介，还包括一些在美国有影响的报刊。《美国新闻与世界报道》说，布什政府指示中央情报局拨出１０００万美元，阻止杜克在大选中获胜。《纽约时报》披露说，美国参院情报委员会去年就曾阻止里根政府在巴拿马策划军事政变的计划。《华盛顿邮报》说，里根政府曾拨款１００万美元在巴拿马建立一个地下电台。
    与此同时，美国南方军总部日前宣布，作为“撤退行动”的一部分，该总部将从巴拿马撤到美国领土上的基地内。美国南方军总部１９６３年进驻巴拿马运河区，统帅范围北起墨西哥南部边界，南至火地岛。
