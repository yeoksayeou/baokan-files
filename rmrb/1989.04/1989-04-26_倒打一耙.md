A restaurant in Yancheng City, Jiangsu Province, experienced a food poisoning incident involving nineteen people. After a joint investigation and verification by the city's epidemic prevention station and relevant departments, the restaurant was penalized. However, the restaurant's management did not comply with the penalty decision and instead filed an appeal with the people's court.

A private entrepreneur started operating without obtaining a food hygiene permit in the local area. The epidemic prevention station's supervisory personnel discovered this and instructed the entrepreneur to obtain the permit before continuing operations. Unexpectedly, the entrepreneur sued the epidemic prevention station for interfering with their normal business operations. This is truly a case of striking back.

Similar incidents have occurred in various places, causing supervisory departments to lament. The Food Hygiene Law has been in effect for over five years, but lawbreakers act with impunity. Supervisors who enforce the law face numerous obstacles, and many comrades propose that "the villain strikes first" should be severely punished. Otherwise, if left unchecked, more people will imitate this behavior, making it impossible for supervisory departments to manage, and ultimately, consumers will suffer.

　　倒打一耙
    胡度仁
    江苏盐城市有一家饭店，发生一起十九人食物中毒事件，经市卫生防疫站和有关部门联合调查核实后给予处罚。可饭店领导人不执行处罚决定，反向人民法院提起上诉。
    一个体户，在当地没领取食品卫生许可证就开始营业。市卫生防疫站监督人员发现后，让其补领卫生许可证后再经营。不料这个个体户向法院控告市卫生防疫站干预其正常经营。这真是倒打一耙。
    类似的事件在各地相继发生后，监督部门叫苦不迭。食品卫生法颁布五年多了，违法者无法无天，按法办事的监督者倍受刁难，许多同志提出：对“恶人先告状”要加重惩处，否则，任其下去，仿效者越来越多，监督部门无法去管，反倒显出“倒打一耙”的灵验，最后吃苦头的还是消费者。
