Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 18th.

Sun Junhong, a female Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery at the Changhai Hospital of the Second Military Medical University, has achieved two significant breakthroughs in liver transplantation research under the guidance of her mentor, renowned hepatobiliary surgeon Wu Mengchao.

Operative techniques, suppression of rejection reactions, and prolongation of survival periods have long been critical areas of study for organ transplantation experts. Sun Junhong chose to conduct liver transplantation experiments on rats, which present significant technical challenges. Over three years, she performed over 300 orthotopic liver transplants on rats, achieving a surgical success rate of 92.7%. Not only did she improve the operative techniques for orthotopic liver transplantation in five aspects, thereby increasing the success rate, but she also established a stable and reliable experimental model. This model provides a dependable, economical, and unique method for liver transplantation research, including organ preservation, anti-rejection drugs, and the immunological basis of transplantation, offering substantial practical value. Building on this foundation, Sun Junhong delved into methods for achieving long-term survival of transplanted livers. She successfully induced a specific "immune non-response," effectively protecting the transplanted liver from rejection. As a result, more than half of the 300 orthotopic liver transplants achieved long-term survival. Additionally, she verified the crucial role of T suppressor cells in anti-rejection processes, uniquely revealing the essence of rejection reactions in organ transplantation.

Prominent surgical experts Qiu Fazhu and Wu Zhaoguang highly praised these two achievements, deeming them to have reached international advanced levels.

　　潜心探索肝移植长期存活　孙君泓获得两项突出成果
    新华社上海４月１８日电　第二军医大学长海医院肝胆外科女博士生孙君泓，在导师、著名肝胆外科教授吴孟超指导下，在肝移植实验研究中获得两项突出成果。
    肝移植操作技术、抑制排异反应、提高存活期一直是器官移植专家研究的重要课题。孙君泓选择操作技术难度较大的大鼠进行肝移植实验研究，在３年内施行大鼠原位肝移植３００多例，手术成功率达到９２．７％，不仅有５处改进了原位肝移植的操作技术，提高了手术成功率，而且建立了稳定可靠的实验模型，为肝移植的实验研究（包括器官保存、抗排斥药物、移植免疫学基础研究等）提供了一种可靠、经济、独特的手段，具有较大的实用价值。在此基础上，孙君泓潜心探索移植肝长期存活的方法，成功地诱导出特异性“免疫无反应”，有效地保护了移植肝不受排斥，使３００例原位肝移植中半数以上得以长期存活，同时还验证了Ｔ抑制细胞在抗排斥中的重要作用，独到地揭示出器官移植中排异反应的本质。
    著名外科专家裘法祖、吴肇光高度评价了这两项成果，认为达到了国际先进水平。
