Yuecheng Reservoir, located in Hebei's Shì County, is separated by water from Anyang, Henan, and is one of China's key dangerous reservoirs. In 1987, the state invested 90 million yuan to reinforce and rebuild the reservoir. The Thirteenth Bureau of the Ministry of Water Resources won the bid to undertake the reconstruction project, which began on November 15 of the same year. Over the course of more than a year of construction, continuous interference from local villagers has caused the project to start and stop repeatedly, affecting the progress and quality of the work.

Last March, a group of local people blocked the construction road and stopped the work, causing more than 60 major production equipment to halt for several days. In one month, they only completed two days' worth of work. On December 12 of the same year, people from Shì County and Anyang mobbed and seized building materials for the dam, forcing the Thirteenth Bureau's drivers to transport the materials for them. When the Thirteenth Bureau's production scheduling department tried to stop them, they were injured.

This year, from March 5 to 15, the construction of the Yuecheng Reservoir reinforcement project was disrupted again. Villagers from nearby, numbering from a few dozen to over 400 people each day, gathered at the stone material collection site, forcibly moving large stones. Some even used stones to smash construction machinery and equipment, breaking the windshields of vehicles. Local relevant personnel went to the scene to persuade them, but the problem remained unresolved.

　　岳城水库加固工程施工受干扰
    岳城水库位于河北磁县，与河南安阳一水相隔，是我国重点危险水库之一。１９８７年国家投资９０００万元，对这个水库加固改建，水电部十三局中标承包了改建工程，于同年１１月１５日开工。施工一年多来，来自当地村民的干扰不断，工程施工干干停停，影响了工程进度和质量。
    去年３月，当地一些人成群结队在施工道路上拦车阻止施工，６０多台主要生产设备停产数天，一个月只完成两天的工作量。去年１２月１２日，磁县、安阳两伙人哄抢筑坝石料，强迫十三局司机驾车为他们运料。十三局生产调度阻止时被打伤。
    今年３月５日至１５日，岳城水库加固工程施工又一次受阻。附近村民每天少则几十人，多则４００多人，聚在石料采集场，强行搬运大块石料，有些人还用石块砸施工机械设备，打碎车辆挡风玻璃。当地有关人员到现场劝阻，仍然解决不了问题。
