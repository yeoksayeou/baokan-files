The international situation is undergoing profound changes. The world is moving towards multipolarity, and the trend of peace and development is becoming increasingly prominent. However, the international situation remains complex and volatile. The contradictions and conflicts between different countries and regions are becoming increasingly prominent, and the struggle between different ideologies and political forces is intensifying. In this context, each country and each political force has its own position and stance, and each holds to their own words.

The United States, as the world's sole superpower, has been actively promoting its own values and interests. It has been intervening in the internal affairs of other countries, imposing its will on others, and seeking to maintain its hegemony. The Soviet Union, although it has been undergoing reforms and opening up, still maintains a strong military presence and seeks to expand its influence. The European countries, although they have been promoting regional integration, still have their own national interests and differences. The developing countries, although they have been advocating for a new international order, still face many challenges and difficulties.

In this complex and volatile international situation, each country and each political force must adhere to their own principles and positions. They must defend their own interests and rights, and at the same time, seek common ground and cooperation with others. They must oppose hegemony and power politics, and promote peace and development. They must adhere to the principles of equality and mutual benefit, and oppose interference and coercion. They must adhere to the principles of independence and self-reliance, and oppose dependence and subordination.

In this context, China, as a developing country, must adhere to its own principles and positions. It must defend its own interests and rights, and at the same time, seek common ground and cooperation with other countries. It must oppose hegemony and power politics, and promote peace and development. It must adhere to the principles of equality and mutual benefit, and oppose interference and coercion. It must adhere to the principles of independence and self-reliance, and oppose dependence and subordination.
