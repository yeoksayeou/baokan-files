Intentional murderer Ma Yingu and thief Rao Yunhe were sentenced to death, with deprivation of political rights for life; thief Zhang Daixue was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve, with deprivation of political rights for life.

Last December 23rd in the afternoon, 20-year-old Ma Yingu, a farmer from Kaiyang County, Guizhou Province, lay down on the tracks in front of a moving freight train at the county's central town station after getting drunk. Station worker Zhang Weiming approached to persuade him to leave, but Ma got up and stabbed Zhang in the left chest with a butcher knife he had with him. Zhang unfortunately died.
