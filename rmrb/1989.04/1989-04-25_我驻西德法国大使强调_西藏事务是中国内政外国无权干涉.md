Our Ambassador to West Germany, Mei Zao-rong, on April 24 held a press conference at the embassy, issuing a statement on the so-called "Tibet and Human Rights" international hearing held by West German parliamentarians. He expressed strong indignation and regret over the hearing's blatant interference in China's internal affairs.

Our Ambassador to France, Zhou Jue, on April 25 held a press conference in Paris regarding some French individuals with official backgrounds meeting with the Dalai Lama and the Dalai Lama's proposal to send a so-called "international investigation team" to Tibet.

Ambassador Zhou pointed out that the Dalai Lama's proposal is absurd, and the Chinese government firmly opposes it. The actions of some French individuals have hurt the feelings of the Chinese people, for which he expressed regret.

Both ambassadors solemnly pointed out that Tibet affairs are purely China's internal matters, and no foreign government, organization, or individual has the right to interfere. (Detailed report on page three)
