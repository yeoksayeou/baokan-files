The Japan Meteorological Agency, based on observational data from approximately 260 locations worldwide, released a report titled "The Current State and Prospects of Recent Global Abnormal Weather and Climate Change" on April 5.

The report concludes that while natural factors such as the atmosphere and oceans were previously the primary causes of abnormal weather, human activities have now become the most significant factor. This includes the increase of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere, as well as the destruction of forests.

The report predicts that by the year 2030, the global average temperature will rise by 1.5 to 3.5 degrees Celsius. Global warming will lead to increased areas of dead forests in mid-latitude regions, further aggravated droughts affecting crop growth, and a rise in sea levels by 20 to 100 centimeters due to thermal expansion of seawater. The Earth will experience unprecedented rapid climate change, significantly impacting society, the economy, and the ecosystem.

　　日本气象厅调查报告认为
　　人类活动是异常气候形成的主因
    本报东京电  记者于青报道：日本气象厅根据世界各地约２６０处观测资料，４月５日发表了题为《近年世界异常气象和气候变化的现状及展望》的调查报告。
    报告认为，过去异常气象形成的原因是大气和海洋等自然因素。近年，大气中二氧化碳、氯氟烃类物质等形成温室效应的气体增加，以及森林遭受破坏，人类活动已成为异常气象形成的最主要因素。
    报告预测：４０年后的２０３０年，地球平均温度将上升１．５至３．５度。全球性气候变暖会导致：中纬度地带森林枯死面积增加；干旱进一步加剧，影响农作物生长；海水热膨胀引起海平面上升２０厘米至１００厘米。地球将发生人类从未经历过的急剧气候变化，对社会、经济、生态造成很大的影响。
