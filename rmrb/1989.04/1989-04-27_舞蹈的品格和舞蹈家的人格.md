The topics of "the character of dance" and "the personality of dancers" have become fashionable.

Reading a history of Chinese dance, I often feel puzzled: the Han dynasty's Zhao Feiyan could be a dancer, and the Tang dynasty's Yang Guifei could also be a dancer; but why aren't the Tang dynasty's Li Bai and the Ming dynasty's Tang Xianzu considered dancers? Although we know about Li Bai's sword dance and Tang Xianzu's song and dance, their dance skills and even their style are not low. Certainly, Li Bai and Tang Xianzu's main contributions are as poets and playwrights, but can this alone disqualify them from being dancers?

Setting aside the ritual dances for ancestral temples and the folk dances of the common people, Chinese ancient dancers at least have two types: one represented by Zhao Feiyan, known as "bending the slender waist to dance on the palm"; the other represented by Li Bai, known as "playing with the clear shadow and dancing under the moon." Dancing on the palm with a slender waist inevitably means bowing to others' commands; dancing under the moon with a clear shadow naturally means being free and unrestrained. Obviously, the "dance of the slender waist on the palm" and the "dance of the clear shadow under the moon" represent two different "dance styles" and two different "personalities": the former uses the "slender waist" to serve others, meaning submitting one's personality to others; the latter uses the "clear shadow" to admire oneself, meaning maintaining the autonomy of one's personality and avoiding a society that is not in harmony with it. For a long time, in our minds, it seems that only banquets and flamboyant colors are dance, and dance can only be flirting in brothels. In fact, Li Bai's dance of joy and swordplay, as a social phenomenon, has not been transcendent from society, but rather calls for a more autonomous life attitude and a more sublime life realm within society. As a free dancer, Li Bai is not inferior to the pioneer of "free dance," Isadora Duncan.

Dance always has its own character. But I do not think that only classical ballet and opera dance are the highest in "character." Certainly, as a cultural heritage of human dance, classical ballet and opera dance have their own aesthetic value. But as a dance cultural phenomenon, I am more interested in the currently very popular "disco" for the elderly and "breakdance" for middle school students. They are not called "dancers," but their dance reveals their personality; this is more precious than those dancers who are proficient in dance skills but do not show their personality. Chinese ancient scholars originally "danced together" in social activities; later, they only used qin (guqin), chess, calligraphy, and painting to cultivate their character, "ashamed to imitate the skills of musicians and artists, and no longer danced like the ancients" (Qing Dynasty, Lang Tingji, "Victory Drinking Chapter"). The root cause of "shaming musicians and no longer dancing" lies in the degradation of the character of dance itself, which is precisely caused by the loss of the dancer's personality.

That was just dance smeared with feudal colors. What we expect today is, first, more spontaneous and free dancers in society, who regard dance as a noble culture in which they participate and cultivate their character; second, dancers should establish their autonomous personality in the overall pattern of social development and use this to shape the independent character of dance. Whether we can shape the independent character of dance through the autonomous personality of dancers directly relates to the social image of dance as a culture. The level of dance character and the realm of dancer personality, in essence, cannot be determined by our own beautification but must be evaluated by society. What we can do is only to seek an autonomous personality and an independent character.

### 舞蹈的品格和舞蹈家的人格

　　舞蹈的品格和舞蹈家的人格
    于平
    “舞蹈的品格”和“舞蹈家的人格”之类的话题变得时髦起来了。
    读一部中国舞蹈史，我时常感到困惑：汉人赵飞燕可以是舞蹈家，唐人杨玉环也可以是舞蹈家；但唐人李白、明人汤显祖为什么不算舞蹈家？尽管我们都知道李白的舞剑、汤显祖的踏歌，其舞蹈水平乃至格调都不低。固然，李白、汤显祖的主导方面是诗家、剧作家，但仅仅因此就可以剥夺其舞籍吗？
    撇开宗庙社稷的祭祀舞蹈和桑间濮上的民众舞蹈，中国古代的舞蹈家至少有两大类型：一类以赵飞燕为代表，所谓“折纤腰舞于掌上”；一类以李白为代表，所谓“弄清影蹈于月下”。掌上折纤腰，难免俯首听命；月下弄清影，自然得意忘形。显然，“掌上纤腰”之舞与“月下清影”之舞两种“舞格”体现出两种不同的“人格”：前者以“纤腰”而事人，也就是说将自己的人格屈从于他人的人格；后者以“清影”而自赏，也就是说为保持自己人格的自主性而避开那个与之不相谐的社会。多年来，在我们的观念中，仿佛只有华筵炫色才是舞蹈，舞蹈也只能青楼调笑。而事实上，李白那种畅欢酣醉而舞剑作歌的舞蹈，作为一种社会现象，实质上也没有超然于社会之外，而是在社会中呼唤一种更为自主的人生品格，一种更为崇高的人生境界。作为一个自由舞蹈家，李白并不比“自由舞蹈”的先驱者伊莎多拉·邓肯逊色。
    舞蹈总是有自己的品格的。但我并不以为只是古典芭蕾和戏曲舞蹈才是“格”之高者。固然，作为人类的舞蹈文化遗产，古典芭蕾和戏曲舞蹈自有其审美价值。但作为一种舞蹈文化现象，我对目前极为普泛的老年人“迪斯科”和中学生“霹雳舞”有着更为浓厚的兴趣。他们不是被称为“舞蹈家”的人，但他们的舞蹈中却可见其人格；这比那种精通舞艺却不见其人格的舞蹈家更为可贵。中国古代的文化人，原本也在社交活动中“以舞相属”；后来只以琴、棋、书、画陶冶品性，“耻效乐工艺益，不复如古人常舞矣”（清·郎廷极《胜饮篇》）。“耻笑乐工，不复常舞”的根源在于舞蹈自身品格的堕落，而这恰恰是由舞蹈家自身人格的失落所导致的。
    那只是涂抹着封建色彩的舞蹈了。我们今天期待的，一是社会中有更多的自发的、自由的舞蹈者，把舞蹈视为一种自身参与其中而陶冶情操的高尚文化；二是舞蹈家要在社会发展的总格局中确立自己的自主人格，并借此塑造舞蹈的独立品格。能不能通过舞蹈家的自主人格去塑造舞蹈的独立品格，直接关系到舞蹈作为一种文化的社会形象。舞蹈品格的层次如何，舞蹈家人格的境界如何，在根本上是不能由我们自美其美而必须由社会评头品足的。我们所能做的，只是求索自主的人格与独立的品格。
