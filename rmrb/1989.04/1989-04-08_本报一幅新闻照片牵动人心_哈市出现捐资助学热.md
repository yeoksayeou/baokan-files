A news photo published in our newspaper on March 27 titled "Elementary School Collapsed Nearly Two Years Ago..." has stirred the hearts of many, including National People's Congress representatives, and has deeply moved the city of Harbin. This has sparked a new wave of donations for education in the city. In a short period, Hulun County has received donations totaling 13 million yuan from various sectors.

It is understood that participants in the donation drive include leaders from Hulun County, as well as factories, individual entrepreneurs, and farmer entrepreneurs. Some units have also proactively donated large quantities of building materials. By the end of April this year, the fundraising work in Hulun County is expected to be completed, and the renovation of school dilapidated buildings will begin in full swing.

The Harbin Municipal Government has decided to ensure that all school dilapidated buildings in the city are eliminated within one year.
