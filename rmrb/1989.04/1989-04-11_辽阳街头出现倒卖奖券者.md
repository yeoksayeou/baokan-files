Recently, a group of people have been openly buying and selling lottery tickets on the streets of Liaoyang City, Liaoning Province.

On the morning of April 4, a reporter saw at the Agricultural Bank of China in Liaoyang City that among the crowd gathered around the prize-winning box, there were about a dozen people openly buying lottery tickets. These individuals held the lottery tickets and money in one hand and the prize numbers in the other. After someone bought a ticket, they would immediately follow and help check the numbers, then demand that the person sell them the winning ticket. Strangely, while the bank staff were selling the tickets, the speculators were openly buying them, and both sides seemed to coexist peacefully. Sometimes, they would even chat warmly with each other.

The reporter asked a bank employee why no one was stopping these people from buying and selling the tickets. The employee replied, "We don't have the authority to stop them. The Public Security Bureau says there are no regulations prohibiting the private buying and selling of lottery tickets."

　　辽阳街头出现倒卖奖券者
    新华社沈阳四月十日电　近日来，辽宁省辽阳市街头出现了一批公开倒卖奖券者。
    四月四日上午，记者在辽阳市农业银行门前看到，在围着摸奖箱摸奖的人群中，有十几个人在公开收购对奖券。这些人一手攥着奖券和钱，一手拿着对奖号码。有人买了奖券后，他们马上跟过去，帮助对号码，然后就要求对方把对奖券卖给他们。奇怪的是，一边是银行工作人员卖奖券，一边是倒爷们公开收购奖券，彼此相安无事。有时，双方还亲热地聊一会儿。
    记者问银行一位同志，这些人倒卖奖券怎么没人制止？他说，我们自己没有力量制止。公安局认为没有什么明文规定奖券不许私人买卖。
