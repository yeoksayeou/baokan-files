According to statistics from the Ministry of Finance's financial bulletin, although the production value of budgeted industrial enterprises nationwide grew in the first quarter of this year, profits saw a significant decline.

From January to March, the cumulative production value of budgeted industrial enterprises nationwide was 150.853 billion yuan, a 3.8% increase compared to the same period last year. Among these, local industrial production grew by 4.1%, and central industrial production grew by 2.8%. Sales revenue amounted to 198.273 billion yuan, a 17.4% increase compared to the same period last year. Local industrial enterprises saw a 20.3% increase, while central industrial enterprises saw a 10% increase.

However, enterprise profits saw a significant decline compared to the same period last year. In the first three months, budgeted industrial enterprises realized profits of 12.145 billion yuan, a 14% decrease compared to the same period last year. Profits declined in the regions of Tianjin, Hebei, Liaoning, Jilin, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Henan, Hubei, and Hunan. Among the 24 central industrial production departments, 13 saw a decline in profits. Notably, the petrochemical industry saw a 25.7% decline, the power industry saw a 58% decline, and the automotive industry saw a 41.9% decline. The profit realized from every 100 yuan of sales revenue by budgeted industrial enterprises was only 6.13 yuan, a 26.7% decrease compared to the same period last year.

According to analysis, the main reasons for the decline in profits are the significant overspending on comparable product costs and the doubling of loss amounts. By the end of March, the cumulative overspending on comparable product costs by budgeted industrial enterprises was 15.8%, amounting to 13.6 billion yuan, a rare occurrence in recent years. By the end of March, there were 8,260 loss-making enterprises among budgeted industrial enterprises, accounting for 22% of all enterprises, with losses amounting to 3.663 billion yuan. Central industrial enterprises with significant increased losses include the Petroleum and Natural Gas Corporation (increased by 4.96 times), central coal enterprises (increased by 1.27 times), and tobacco company production enterprises (increased by 4.3 times).

Preliminary investigations indicate that the overspending on costs and the doubling of losses this year are mainly due to financial tightness, energy shortages, transportation bottlenecks, and rising raw material prices.

Due to the decline in enterprise profits, the amount of profits remitted to the state budget (including income tax and regulatory tax) has been significantly affected. From January to March, the profits remitted by budgeted industrial enterprises decreased by 18.47 billion yuan compared to the same period last year, a 48.5% decrease.

### 首季预算内企业利润大幅度下降  上交利润比去年同期减少１８．４７亿元

　　首季预算内企业利润大幅度下降    
    上交利润比去年同期减少１８．４７亿元
    新华社北京４月２５日电  据财政部财务快报统计，今年第一季度全国预算内工业企业虽然产值增长，利润却大幅度下降。
    １—３月，全国预算内工业企业累计完成产值１５０８．５３亿元，比去年同期增长３．８％，其中地方工业生产增长４．１％，中央工业生产增长２．８％；完成销售收入１９８２．７３亿元，比去年同期增长１７．４％，其中地方工业企业增长２０．３％，中央工业企业增长１０％。
    企业实现利润比去年同期大幅度下降。前３个月，预算内工业企业实现利润１２１．４５亿元，比去年同期下降１４％。实现利润下降的地区有天津、河北、辽宁、吉林、上海、江苏、浙江、河南、湖北、湖南十个省市；中央２４个工业生产部门中有１３个部门实现利润是下降的，其中石化工业下降２５．７％、电力工业下降５８％、汽车工业下降４１．９％。预算内工业企业百元销售收入实现的利润只有６．１３元，比去年同期下降２６．７％。
    据分析，利润下降的主要原因是，可比产品成本大幅度超支，亏损额成倍增加。到３月末，预算内工业企业可比产品成本累计超支１５．８％，超支额为１３６亿元，这是近年来少见的。到３月末预算内工业企业亏损户数为８２６０户，占全部企业户数的２２％，亏损额３６．６３亿元。中央工业增亏大的是：石油天然气公司增亏４．９６倍、中央煤炭企业增亏１．２７倍、烟草公司生产企业增亏４．３倍。
    据初步了解，今年以来成本超支，亏损成倍增加，主要同资金紧张、能源短缺、交通运输不畅和原材料涨价有关。
    由于企业实现利润下降，企业上交财政利润（含所得税、调节税）受到很大影响。１—３月，预算内工业企业上交利润比去年同期减少了１８．４７亿元，下降４８．５％。
