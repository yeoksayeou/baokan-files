On January 16, a resident of Xincheng County, Chen Baogang, invested over 500,000 yuan to purchase raw materials from Lianyang County, Hunan, and hired 34 temporary workers to start producing fireworks. Three days later, a loud explosion turned Chen Baogang's workshop into a pile of rubble. In this tragedy, 27 people died, 21 were injured, 45 nearby houses collapsed, and 176 houses were damaged.

After the accident, investigations by relevant departments revealed that Chen Baogang's fireworks workshop had no approval or registration procedures and lacked any safety measures. Notably, a deputy director of the county public security bureau's public security division, who was responsible for approving fireworks production, was Chen Baogang's relative. Despite knowing that Chen Baogang was producing fireworks at home, he did not intervene. Additionally, the introduction letter Chen Baogang used to purchase materials in Hunan was issued by the county procuratorate.

Social demand has driven the abnormal development of the fireworks industry. Many individual entrepreneurs, lacking production conditions and technology, prioritize profit over safety, leading to illegal production. As a result, disasters strike before the fireworks even leave the door. Statistics show that last year, Xincheng County had over 2,000 individual fireworks producers, most of whom had not been approved by relevant departments. In recent years, over 95% of fireworks explosion accidents in this county occurred in illegal individual workshops.

Currently, all fireworks producers in Xincheng County have ceased operations. However, if managers and producers do not fundamentally change their mindset and take measures, tragedies may repeat after the bloodshed fades!

### 一场惨剧之后的沉思

　　一场惨剧之后的沉思
    １月１６日，我市郾城县西街居民陈宝刚投资５万多元，从湖南浏阳县购进原料，雇用３４名临时工，干起了生产烟花爆竹的行当。３天之后，随着一声巨响，陈宝刚的作坊顿时成为一片瓦砾。在这场惨剧中，有２７人死亡，２１人受伤，附近４５间民房倒塌，１７６间房屋受损。
    事故发生后，经有关部门查证，陈宝刚的烟花爆竹生产作坊既没有申报审批手续，也没有注册登记，更无安全生产措施。值得指出的是，负责审批烟花爆竹生产的县公安局治安股一位副股长恰恰是陈宝刚的亲戚，他得知陈宝刚在家里生产烟花爆竹后，竟没有过问。另外，陈宝刚非法生产烟花爆竹，到湖南购买原料的介绍信竟是县检察院给开的。
    社会的需求刺激着烟花爆竹生产行业的畸形发展。许多个体户在不具备生产条件和技术的情况下，为了赚钱，将安全置于脑后，大肆进行非法生产。结果鞭炮未出门，横祸先降。据统计，去年郾城县生产烟花爆竹的个体户就有２０００多家，大多数未经有关部门审批。近几年这个县发生的烟花爆竹爆炸事故中，９５％以上的都发生在非法生产的个体户家里。
    目前，郾城县生产烟花爆竹的个体户都已歇业。但是，如果管理者和生产者不能从根本上改变认识，采取措施，血腥飘散以后，悲剧还可能重演！
