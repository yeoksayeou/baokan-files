The Economic Department of this newspaper invited relevant experts to discuss how to quickly change the backward situation of transportation (Part 2)

Summary:
From the perspective of the passenger and freight volume handled by China's railways, the railway will remain the backbone of transportation for the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" and even longer. The idea of rushing for quick results in railway construction is not feasible. Some propose several five-year plans of investment tilt and support; others propose that the state provides policies to establish the enterprise status of railways and manages them with the enterprise operation mechanism.

Relieving the Tight Transportation Situation, Developing Railways Is the Key to the Key

Teng Zongxing (Deputy Director of the Long-Term Planning Department, State Planning Commission): Due to the long-term severe shortage of railway transportation capacity and the recent rapid growth of industrial production, the tight situation of railway transportation has not only not been alleviated but has further intensified.

Given China's energy characteristics, the structure of primary energy, with coal as the main component, will remain unchanged for a long time. The transportation of coal from the north to the south and from the west to the east has become a certainty. Therefore, for a considerable period, it is necessary to accelerate railway construction; otherwise, the development of China's energy industry and even the entire national economy will be seriously threatened.

From the perspective of the passenger and freight volume handled by China's railways, the railway will remain the backbone of transportation for the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" and even longer. Therefore, during the "Eighth Five-Year Plan," it is necessary to further strengthen railway construction. From a macro perspective, railway construction should focus on solving the transportation channels for coal from Shanxi, the north-south main channel, strengthening the exit channel, the northwest channel, and the southwest channel. The comprehensive solution to these problems requires efforts over several five-year plans. The "Eighth Five-Year Plan" should focus on these five major channels and accelerate construction.

Shen Zhijie (Director of the Planning and Statistics Bureau, Ministry of Railways): Currently, all modes of transportation in China do not meet the needs of national economic development and must undergo significant development, but they should follow their objective laws. If the relationship between various transportation structures is artificially distorted, the ultimate cost will be very high. Some comrades believe that comprehensive transportation is a panacea for solving the problem of transportation capacity shortages, and as long as comprehensive transportation is well-managed, the contradictions can be resolved. It should be admitted that there are irrational elements in the current transportation structure, and appropriate adjustments can be made through policies and regulations to guide and reduce irrational transportation, thereby increasing effective transportation volume. However, since the entire transportation system has the problem of insufficient capacity, relying solely on the development of comprehensive transportation cannot fundamentally solve the problem of severe shortage of transportation capacity.

Li Peixi (Deputy Director and Researcher, Economic and Technological Social Development Research Center, State Council): In recent years, the additional freight turnover volume of railways each year has been mainly completed by "digging potential" within the transportation system. The current extremely tight transportation situation shows that this overloaded transportation has reached its limit. Since the increase in transportation capacity is not a short-term solvable issue, if strong measures are not taken, the overall economic growth will be affected for a considerable period.

According to the impact of various departments' production capacity on the entire national economy, industries can be divided into four types. The first type is basic infrastructure that cannot be imported or is difficult to import, mainly referring to electricity, railways, and transportation and postal services; the second type is tradable basic products and mineral products; the third type is processing industries that require rapid development in the industrialization process; the fourth type is consumer goods industries. Railways are basic infrastructure, and the current inverted pyramid structure seriously affects the stability of the entire economy. This is mainly reflected in:

1. Causing economic fluctuations and restricting economic growth. In recent years, the amplitude of China's economic fluctuations has already exceeded the cyclical economic fluctuations of capitalist countries.

2. Affecting the flow of factors. For China's economy to become an efficient economy, it must play the role of the market and make factors flow through the market, and transportation is an indispensable condition.

3. Due to natural and developmental characteristics, the long-term formed transportation structure is dominated by railway transportation. From a medium- to long-term perspective, the proportion of highways, waterways, and aviation will increase, and the level of diversification will improve, but the railway-dominated pattern will not change in this century. Therefore, relieving China's transportation tension, developing railways is the key to the key.

4. Railways require a lot of investment and have a long construction period. Once problems arise, they are difficult to solve in the short term.

5. Railways not only affect production but also affect people's lives and social stability. The tension in railway transportation has already caused some social problems to be on the verge of explosion.

Li Zhongfan (Senior Economist, Theory and Propaganda Department, State Commission for Economic Restructuring): For China's economy to have stable development, energy and transportation problems must be solved. Transportation, including railways, highways, aviation, waterways, and pipelines, must be developed. This is undeniable, but it should be based on China's national conditions. In terms of sequence, railways are in a dominant position and will not change for at least ten years. Developing aviation does not have that much money, and developing highways does not have that many cars. Therefore, based on China's reality, it is necessary to develop railways as the main channel and backbone of transportation.

Distorted Prices Lead to Distorted Structures

Li Peixi: I believe the main reasons for the current railway transportation tension are:

1. Distorted prices lead to distorted structures. For a long time, the prices of raw materials, energy, electricity, and transportation, especially railways, in China have been low, while the prices of finished products have been high. In recent years, although a series of reforms have been carried out, they have mostly been limited to the price fields of agricultural and sideline products and consumer industrial products. The prices of production materials, especially energy and transportation, have remained low for a long time.

2. Macroeconomic control measures are weak. Expanding investment in short-legged industries is a direct and effective way to adjust the industrial structure. Due to the need for reform and development, the financial sector has always been tight. Although the state has invested a large portion of the budget in energy and transportation, these short-legged investments still account for a decreasing share compared to the overall fixed asset investment of the entire society.

Tan Hecun (Director of the Audit Bureau, Ministry of Railways): To accelerate the development of railways, with the approval of the State Council, the "input-output, road-building" economic responsibility system was implemented during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan." This full-industry contract essentially changes the railways from state-owned and state-operated to state-owned and road-operated, reflecting the separation of ownership and management rights, and enhancing the vitality of railways. Over the past three years of contracting, transportation production has continued to grow, with an average annual increase of 7.6% in passenger and freight turnover volume, and transportation revenue reaching a historical high. Economic benefits and transportation labor productivity have improved year by year, and construction funds have had a stable source. The progress of key construction projects has accelerated. The practice of the past three years has proven that the direction of the railway contract responsibility system is correct. However, with the change of objective conditions and the deepening of reform, the railway contract responsibility system has encountered new problems. One is that after the contract, due to the failure to adjust the freight rates as planned, the large increase in prices has made the railways face the severe situation of low freight rates against high prices and dead freight rates against living prices, making it difficult for the railways to continue self-development. The second is that the railway contract responsibility system stipulates that during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan," railways, except for paying 5% of the business tax, will not pay other taxes and fees. In fact, the state has levied new taxes on railways every year, plus various local levies, making the burden on railways increasingly heavy. These two reasons make it difficult for the railway contract responsibility system to continue. Therefore, for railways to develop, it is necessary to formulate a long-term and stable policy that is conducive to the development of railways. It is necessary to implement tilted investment according to the characteristics of railways' high investment and long construction period; the freight rates of railways should be gradually adjusted in a planned manner; in terms of finance, it is necessary to provide support and reduce the tax burden on railways.

One Proposal: Tilted Investment Arrangement;
One Proposal: The State Provides Policies, Allowing Railways to Develop Fully

Teng Zongxing: Domestic and international practices have proven that if the infrastructure lags behind economic growth, forming a "top-heavy" economic structure, it is very difficult to adjust, and it requires long-term persistent efforts to fundamentally reverse it. Therefore, we must put this problem at the height of economic development strategy and implement tilted investment arrangements.

Solving the transportation problem is a systematic project, and it is not possible to discuss railways in isolation; it must be comprehensively planned and comprehensively treated.

1. Develop a comprehensive transportation network. Currently, transportation in China is generally tight, and it is necessary to develop in a coordinated manner. Various modes of transportation should be planned comprehensively and reasonably allocated to give full play to their respective advantages.

2. Effectively balance the national economy and strive to achieve sustained, stable, and coordinated development. The development speed of industrial and agricultural production must fully consider the bearing capacity of "bottleneck" industries. Such macro-decisions and major comprehensive balances must be based on scientific foundations and strive to avoid arbitrariness and blindness.

3. Strive to improve the quality of goods and increase effective transportation, limiting irrational transportation.

4. Adjust the layout of productive forces. In the future, the layout of new productive forces and the selection of major projects should fully consider the needs of the comprehensive transportation network. For some products and industries that use a lot of coal and energy, they should be built in areas rich in energy.

5. Formulate policies conducive to promoting the development of the railway and other transportation industries. During the "Seventh Five-Year Plan," the state implemented a contract responsibility system for railways, which had good results. What should be done during the "Eighth Five-Year Plan"? It is necessary to conduct research as soon as possible and come up with an implementation plan for the State Council to decide.

Shen Zhijie: The current problems facing railways are many, and the most fundamental problem is that development is seriously lagging behind. The specific manifestation is that the quantity of equipment is seriously insufficient, whether it is fixed facilities or mobile facilities, and this is the crux of the problem. The solution is only one, that is, to quickly increase the quantity and quality (technology) of railway transportation facilities from two aspects, and gradually improve the current tight situation. The current urgent task is to focus on expanding the transportation of coal from Shanxi, north-south transportation, and the main channels to various regions, and arrange the construction of several new trunk lines. If work is started now, these new lines can form capacity during the "Ninth Five-Year Plan." In addition, according to calculations, 90% of the additional transportation volume needed for the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" economic development must be borne by the existing lines. Therefore, technical transformation and equipment with new technologies to improve the capacity of the existing lines is still an issue that cannot be ignored in the network construction.

Li Zhongfan: The current important issue is to clarify our strategic thinking on the development of railways. In a sense, this is more important than the strategic position. Is it to rely on state investment, or to be self-reliant under the premise of developing commodity economy, which needs to be discussed and studied. One opinion is that since railways are a strategic focus, they are also a focus of investment, and the state should support railway construction. This is logically reasonable, but in reality, it may be like drawing a cake to fill one's stomach. One is that the state provides policies, truly deepens the reform, and establishes railways as state-owned, state-operated, and monopolistic large enterprises, using the operation and management of enterprises. I think it is difficult to solve the railway problem in the near future without this. But to achieve this, it is necessary for the state to provide policies and allow full development, and the targets you propose must be attractive to the central decision-making. On this premise, you can ask for policies. There are two points that can be analyzed. First, clearly understand the demand of the national economy for railways; second, clearly understand that the transportation volume of railways must have a significant increase. Compare several plans and propose an attractive, operable, and contract responsibility-based plan. Another strategic idea is that in addition to introducing foreign capital, railway construction should also mobilize the enthusiasm of local governments, and there should be a mechanism for the whole society to raise funds to build railways. The funds of railways should also be able to operate efficiently, and the funds should not be idle in the hands, and there should be a flexible mechanism.

Sun Hongguang (Deputy Director of the Industrial Policy Department, State Planning Commission): In the past period, the problem of tight transportation was relatively prominent, and now coal, electricity, and other problems are gradually emerging. This is a structural problem, and basic industries are far behind processing industries. Last year, the growth rate of the national industrial output value was 17%, while the growth rate of railway freight volume was only 2.6%. Railways supported such a high-speed growth with a speed equivalent to 1/8 of industrial growth, which is obviously not feasible. The capacity of railways has been overloaded, and the safety factor has also been eaten up. The current key is to open up several coal transportation channels, to transport by water where it should be transported by water, and to transport by truck where it should be transported by truck, to have a reasonable division of labor, and to ensure that coal is transported out.

    加快铁路建设已到关键时刻
    本报经济部邀请有关方面人士座谈如何尽快改变交通运输滞后局面（下）
    提要：
    从我国铁路承担的客货运量来看，“八五”乃至更长时期内，以铁路为运输骨干的局面将不会改变。加快铁路建设，急功近利的想法是不行的。有的主张经过几个五年计划的投资倾斜和扶持；有的主张国家给政策，确立铁路的企业地位，用企业的经营机制来管理。
    缓解交通运输紧张局面，发展铁路是关键中的关键
    滕宗兴（国家计委长期规划司副司长）：由于长期以来铁路运输能力严重不足，加上近几年工业生产超高速增长，铁路运输的紧张状况不仅没有得到缓和，而且进一步加剧了。
    根据我国能源特点，一次能源结构中以煤炭为主体的格局将长期不会改变，北煤南调、西煤东运已成定局，因此，在一个相当长的时期内，必须加快铁路建设，否则，我国的能源工业以致整个国民经济的发展都将受到严重威胁。
    从我国铁路承担的客、货运量来看，“八 五”乃至更长时期内，以铁路为运输骨干的局面将不会改变。因此，“八五”期间必须进一步加强铁路的建设。从全局看，铁路建设要重点解决山西煤炭外运通道、南北大通道、强化出关通道、西北通道和西南通道。这些问题的全面解决，需要经过几个五年计划的努力，“八五”就应该在这五大通道上下功夫，加快建设。
    沈之介（铁道部计划统计局局长）：当前，我国各种运输方式都不适应国民经济发展的需要，都必须有一个大的发展，但应遵循其客观规律。如果人为地扭曲各种运输结构的关系，最终是要付出很大代价的。现在有一些同志认为，综合运输是解决运输能力紧张的一剂良药，只要搞好综合运输，矛盾就可迎刃而解了。应该承认当前运输结构中存在着不合理的地方，进行适当调整，从政策、法规上加以引导，是可以减少不合理运输的成分，从而增加有效运输量。但是由于整个运输系统都存在着能力不足的问题，因此仅仅发展综合运输是不可能从根本上解决运能严重不足这个根本问题的。
    李泊溪（国务院经济技术社会发展研究中心常务干事、研究员）：近些年来，铁路每年所增加的货物周转量，绝大部分是依靠对运输系统内部的“挖潜”来完成的。而当前出现的交通运输空前紧张的局面，说明这种超负荷运输已达极限。由于新增运输能力不是短期能够解决的事情，所以，若不采取强有力措施，整个经济的增长必将在相当长的时间内受到全面的影响。
    按照各部门生产能力对整个国民经济的影响程度，可以将产业分成四种类型。第一种是不可进口或难以进口的基础结构，主要指电力、铁路及交通邮电；第二种是可贸易的基础产品及矿产品；第三种是工业化进程中要求高速度发展的加工工业；第四种是消费品工业。铁路是基础设施，目前这种倒金字塔形结构，严重影响了整个经济的稳定。主要表现在：
    一、引起经济波动，制约经济增长。最近几年，我国经济波动的幅度，已经超过资本主义国家周期性经济波动的震幅。
    二、影响了要素的流动。中国的经济要变成有效率的经济，就要发挥市场的作用，通过市场使要素流动，而交通运输是必不可少的条件。
    三、由于自然特点和发展特点，长期形成的交通结构是以铁路运输为主。从中长期看公路、水路、航空的比例会有所增长，多样化水平会提高，但在本世纪内以铁路为主体的格局不会改变，因此缓解中国的交通运输的紧张局面，发展铁路是关键中的关键。
    四、铁路需要的投资多，建设周期长，一旦出现问题，难以在短期内解决。
    五、铁路不仅影响生产，而且影响人民生活和社会的安定，铁路运输的紧张对一些社会问题已经造成了一触即发之势。
    李中凡（国家体改委理论宣传司高级经济师）：中国的经济要有稳定的发展，能源、交通运输问题不解决，日子非常难过。交通运输，包括铁路、公路、航空、水运、管道都要发展，这是没有问题的，但要从中国的国情出发，次序上铁路是主导地位，至少十年不变。发展航空没有那么多钱，发展高速公路我们居民没有那么多小汽车。所以，从中国的实际出发，要发展铁路这个运输的主渠道和骨干。
    扭曲的价格导致了扭曲的结构。铁路三年大包干，方向是正确的。但由于低运价对高物价，死运价对活物价，难以继续自我发展
    李泊溪：我认为造成当前铁路运输紧张的主要原因是：
    一、扭曲的价格导致了扭曲的结构。长期以来，我国的原材料、能源、电力、交通运输特别是铁路等基础产业的价格偏低，制成品价格偏高。近几年来虽然进行了一系列改革，但大多局限在农副产品与消费工业品的价格领域，生产资料价格，尤其是能源和交通运输的价格一直偏低。
    二、宏观调控手段乏力。扩大对短腿产业投资是调整产业结构的一种直接和有效的手段，由于改革和发展都需要财政的支持，所以财政一直绷得很紧。尽管国家将预算内投资的绝大部分投向了能源及交通运输等短腿产业，但与全社会膨胀的固定资产投资相比，这些短腿投资的比重仍呈下降趋势。
    檀鹤铨（铁道部审计局局长）：为了加速铁路发展，经国务院批准，在“七五”期间实行“投入产出，以路建路”经济承包责任制。这种全行业承包，实质是把铁路由国有国营改为国有路营，体现了所有权和经营权的分离，增强了铁路的活力。承包三年来，运输生产持续增长，客、货周转量平均每年增长7.6％，运输收入增长创历史最高水平，经济效益和运输劳动生产率逐年提高，建设资金有了稳定的来源。重点建设工程进度加快。三年来的实践证明，铁路大包干的方向是正确的。但是随着客观条件的变化和改革的深入发展，铁路大包干又遇到了新问题。一是承包后由于运价未按计划调整，物价上涨幅度过大，铁路面临低运价对高物价、死运价对活物价的严峻形势，使铁路成本上升，积累下降，难以继续自我发展。二是铁路大包干方案中规定，“七五”期间铁路除上交5％的营业税外，不再上交其他税费。但实际上国家每年都向铁路开征新的税费，再加上地方种种摊派，使铁路负担不断加重。这两个原因使铁路大包干难以为继。因此，铁路要发展，必须要制定一个有利于铁路发展的长期稳定的政策。要针对铁路投资密集、建设周期长的特点实行倾斜投资；对铁路的运价，要有计划逐步进行调整；在财政上要进行扶持，减轻铁路的税赋负担。
    一种主张：投资安排上重点倾斜；
    一种主张：国家给政策，让铁路充分发展
    滕宗兴：国内外实践都已证明，如果基础设施落后于经济增长，形成了“头重脚轻”的经济结构，调整起来非常困难，需要长期坚持不懈的努力，才能从根本上扭转过来。因此，我们一定要把这个问题摆到经济发展战略的高度上去认识，在投资安排上实行重点倾斜。
    解决交通运输问题是一个系统工程，不能就铁路论铁路，而必须通盘规划，实行综合治理。
    一是要发展综合运输网。目前我国交通运输是全面紧张，应该全面协调发展，各种运输方式要统筹规划，合理配置，发挥各自的优势。
    二是切实搞好国民经济的综合平衡，努力作到持续、稳定、协调地发展。工农业生产的发展速度必须充分考虑到“瓶颈”产业的承受能力，这种宏观决策和重大的综合平衡，必须建立在科学的基础上，力求避免随意性和盲目性。
    三是努力提高货物品质，增加有效运输，限制不合理运输。
    四是调整生产力布局。今后新的生产力布局和重大项目的布点的选择，要充分考虑综合运输网的需要。对一些用煤、用能源大的产品和产业，要建在能源丰富的地区。
    五是制定有利于促进铁路等交通运输行业发展的政策。“七五”期间，国家对铁路实行了包干政策，收到了较好效果。“八五”怎么办，应尽快研究，拿出实施方案，供国务院决策。
    沈之介：铁路当前存在的问题很多，最根本的问题是发展严重滞后。具体的表现形式是设备数量严重不足，无论是固定设施还是移动设施，都严重不足，这是问题的症结所在。解决的出路只有一条，就是从数量和质量（技术）两个方面尽快增加铁路运输设施，逐步改善目前的紧张状况。目前当务之急是围绕扩大晋煤外运、南北运输和通向各大区的主要通道，安排几条新干线建设。如果现在动手，这些新线可在“九五”期间形成能力。另外，据测算，“八五”经济发展需要增加的运量中，90％要靠既有线路承担，因此，对既有线进行技术改造，装备新技术，提高既有线的能力仍然是路网建设中不容忽视的问题。
    李中凡：现在重要的问题是，要明确我们发展铁路的战略思想是什么？这个问题在某种意义上比战略地位更重要。是依靠国家投资，还是在发展商品经济的前提下自力更生，需要着重讨论研究。一种意见是铁路既然是战略重点，那就是投资重点，国家要保铁路建设。这从逻辑上是说得通的，实际上可能是画饼充饥。一种是国家给我政策，真正深化改革，确立铁路是国有的、国营的、垄断性的大企业，用企业的经营、企业的机制来运用和管理。我看舍此在近期内很难解决铁路问题。但要做到这一点，就是国家给你政策，让你充分发展，那你提出的目标必须对中央的决策有吸引力。在这个前提下要点政策，有两点可以作些分析。第一要看清国民经济发展对铁路的需求；第二要看清铁路的运量肯定还要有一个大幅度的增加。几个方案比较，提出一个有吸引力的、可操作的、大包干基础上的方案。另一个战略思想是铁路建设除引进外资以外，还要调动地方的积极性，要有一个动员全社会集资办铁路的机制。铁路的资金，也要能够高效运转，资金不要闲置在手上，要有一个灵活的机制。
    孙鸿光（国家计委产业政策司副司长）：前一段，交通运输紧张的问题比较突出，现在煤炭、电力等慢慢地表现出来了。这是一个结构性的问题，基础产业远远落后于加工工业。去年全国工业产值增长17％，而铁路的货运量只增长了2.6％，铁路用相当于工业增长1／8左右的速度，支撑着这样的高速度，显然是不行的。铁路的能力已经超饱和，安全系数也被吃掉。现在关键是要拉通运煤的几个通道，该下水的下水，该汽车运的汽车运，要有一个合理的分工，保证把煤运出来。
