In the third month of spring, we investigated over 100 households in Chang'an County who had built new houses. Among them, more than 80 households had borrowed money to build their houses, and the utilization rate of these new houses was only about half. Why do these farmers insist on building houses with debt?

The constraints of traditional concepts. Building a new house and marrying off a daughter are still considered two major responsibilities of elderly farmers for their younger generations. In the 100-plus households we surveyed, over 95% built new houses for their younger generations, and most of these were two-story buildings. Each building costs more than 8,000 yuan. The debt of most households is around 5,000 yuan. In one village in Fan Village Township, a farmer's child is only 3 years old, but the family lives in a spacious and bright two-room house. However, to prepare for their son, the family demolished the old house and borrowed 6,000 yuan to build a two-story new house.

The influence of the comparison trend. Villages compete with villages, and households compete with households. If one builds a single-story house, another builds a two-story house. Most people, regardless of their family's economic conditions, engage in a competition to build the tallest and most impressive new houses. In one household with three people in Xi Liu Township, they borrowed over 4,000 yuan last year to build a two-story new house. The reason was: "If we don't build a new house, people will laugh at us." Some young women in rural areas consider new houses as a major condition for marrying into a family, further exacerbating this comparison trend.

One-size-fits-all planning. Some townships and villages do not consider the farmers' economic capacity and emphasize uniformity, requiring new houses to be tall, large, and modern. If a farmer builds a single-story house, they will not be allocated a plot of land, forcing some farmers to build two-story houses with debt.

### 长安县农民负债建新房

　　长安县农民负债建新房
    阳春三月，我们调查了长安县１００多户建房农民。其中，借钱建房的竟达８０多户，新房的利用率仅占一半。这些农民为什么要负债建房呢？
    传统观念的束缚。盖新房，娶媳妇，仍是年长农民对晚辈承担的两项义务。在调查的１００多家农户中，９５％以上的农户都是为晚辈建房，而且多数建的是二层楼房。每栋楼房需花费８０００元以上。多数建房户的债务在５０００元左右。樊村乡一农民的孩子才３岁，住的两房间也宽敞明亮。但是，为了儿子，这家农户硬是拆掉旧房，借６０００元盖了一栋二层楼的新房。
    攀比风的影响。村比村，户比户，你盖一层，我盖两层。大多数人不顾家庭经济条件，在建房上互相攀比，比新房的高大、气派。细柳乡一户３口之家，去年借了４０００多元盖了一栋两层楼的新房。为的是：“不盖楼房人家笑话咱”。一些农村女青年把新房作为与男方结婚的主要条件，更加剧了这种攀比风。
    规划上的一刀切。一些乡村不考虑农民的经济承受能力，强调整齐划一，新建房一律要高、大、洋。若建平房，就不给庄基地，迫使部分农民负债盖楼房。
