Today, the representatives of the Beijing delegation to the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress sent a letter to the Beijing Military Region, expressing their gratitude for the military region's cultivation of the soldier Li Wensmin, who sacrificed himself to save a drowning child.

On the afternoon of March 31, Li Wensmin of the First Communication Headquarters of the Beijing Military Region was passing by the Shunlin Lock near the west side of the Deshengmen Arrow Tower when he saw a child floating up and down in the river. Without hesitation, Li Wensmin jumped into the water, grabbed the child, and swam towards the shore. However, due to the deep water and the steep, slippery slope of the shore, he lost his strength and sank into the river along with the child, tragically sacrificing his life.

    ３月３１日下午，北京军区第一通信总站李文敏途经德胜门箭楼以西护城河松林闸时，发现一名儿童在河水中上下起浮。李文敏毫不犹豫地跳入水中，抓住他向岸边游去。但因河水深，加上岸陡坡滑，体力不支，和儿童一起沉入河中，不幸牺牲。
