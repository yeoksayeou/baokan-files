The Bank of China has established resident foreign currency savings services in response to the increasing number of residents who remit foreign exchange from abroad or hold foreign currency. Many readers have inquired about the procedures for opening foreign currency deposits. Here are the details:

To open a foreign currency savings account, residents need to fill out a Type C deposit account application form, provide a signature specimen or agree in writing on the withdrawal method, and the bank will issue a named passbook. According to current regulations, deposits can be made directly in U.S. dollars, British pounds, German marks, Japanese yen, French francs, and Hong Kong dollars. Other freely convertible currencies, such as Australian dollars and Canadian dollars, can be converted into one of the above currencies at the exchange rate on the day of deposit (foreign exchange certificates cannot be deposited). Foreign exchange remitted from abroad, brought in, or held by residents can be deposited into a foreign exchange account; foreign currency cash held by residents can be deposited into a foreign cash account. The main difference between the two is that funds in a foreign exchange account can be freely remitted out, while funds in a foreign cash account can be freely withdrawn in cash.

When residents open a foreign currency deposit account, the bank does not inquire about the source of the funds, and depositors do not need to provide any proof of the source. The bank is responsible for keeping the depositor's information confidential.

The minimum deposit amount for demand deposits is not less than the equivalent of twenty yuan in foreign exchange. This type of deposit can be withdrawn at any time, but the interest rate is relatively low. For example, the annual interest rate for U.S. dollars is 2.5%, meaning that a deposit of one hundred U.S. dollars would earn 2.5 U.S. dollars in interest per year.

Time deposits have terms of three months, six months, one year, and two years. The minimum deposit amount is not less than the equivalent of fifty yuan in foreign exchange. The interest rates for time deposits are higher, and recently, with the fluctuations in international exchange rates, the interest rates for various currencies have increased significantly, especially for the British pound and the U.S. dollar.

If the interest rate is adjusted before the maturity of a time deposit, the interest will still be calculated based on the original rate on the day of deposit. For example, the U.S. dollar time deposit rate for three months was 8.8125% on February 18, 1989, and it increased to 9.1875% on March 1, 1989. If a depositor deposited U.S. dollars on February 18 for a three-month term, the interest will still be calculated at 8.8125%. Some customers believe that it is not cost-effective to deposit at a lower interest rate, especially if the interest rate is adjusted within a short period. They may choose to withdraw the funds and redeposit at a higher interest rate. This is possible, but the bank has regulations: time deposits can be withdrawn early only once before maturity, and the interest rate for the withdrawn amount will be calculated based on the demand deposit rate.

　　居民外币储蓄

    问：中国银行为了适应近年来国内居民从境外汇入外汇，或手持外钞者日益增多的情况，增设了居民外币储蓄业务。很多群众来信询问，办理外币存款需要哪些手续？
    答：国内居民办理外币储蓄首先要填写丙种存款开户申请书，预留印鉴或书面约定支取方式，由银行开给一个记名式存折。根据现行规定，美元、英镑、联邦德国马克、日元、法国法郎、港元六种货币可直接办理存款，其他可自由兑换的外币，如澳元、加元等，由存款人自由选择上述币种之一按存入日的外汇牌价折算入帐（外汇券不能存入）。由境外汇入、携入或国内居民自己持有的可自由兑换的外汇可存入外汇帐户；国内居民所持有的外币现钞可存入外钞帐户。两者的主要区别是外汇帐户可以自由汇出，外钞帐户可自由支取外钞。
    居民在办理外币存款开户手续时，银行不问资金来源，储户不必提交任何有关来源的证明，银行负责为储户保密。
    问：外币起存金额是多少？利率分几个档次？
    答：活期存款，起存金额为不低于二十元人民币的等值外汇。这种存款可以随用随取，但利率较低。如美元的活期利率年息为百分之二点五，即存一百美元，一年所得利息为二点五美元。
    定期存款期限分为三个月、六个月、一年、二年。起存金额为不低于五十元人民币的等值外汇。定期存款的利率较高，最近随国际外汇市场汇率的变动，各种货币的利率都有明显提高，特别是英镑和美元。
    问：如果遇到利率调整，定期外币存款利息怎样计算？
    答：定期外币存款未到期如遇利率调整，仍按存入日原订利率计息。例如，一九八九年二月十八日美元定期利率三个月为百分之八点八一二五，一九八九年三月一日升为百分之九点一八七五。如果储户在二月十八日存入一笔定期三个月的美元现钞，现在仍按百分之八点八一二五计息。有些客户认为，从二月十八日到三月一日仅十一天就遇利率调整，按低利率存款不合算，不如取出来再转存一个高利率的存款。这样做也可以。但银行对此有规定，即定期存款未到期提前支取仅限一次，而且取出这部分现钞的利率一律按活期存款计息。
