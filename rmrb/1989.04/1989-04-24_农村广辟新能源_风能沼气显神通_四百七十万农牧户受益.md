    Villages Expand New Energy Sources: Wind and Biogas Show Their Power

    4.78 Million Farming and Herding Households Benefit

    BEIJING, April 24 (Xinhua) — According to the Ministry of Agriculture, 4.78 million farming and herding households and over 18 million rural residents in China have already adopted wind and biogas as new energy sources.

    Among the over 200 million farming households in the country, about one-quarter still use kerosene lamps. In these areas, small wind turbines and biogas systems have rapidly developed to meet the needs of farmers and herders. From 1976 to 1986, China developed a total of 10,000 small wind turbines. In the past three years, the number of wind turbines has increased by 70,000. Chinese scientists have developed low-wind-speed small wind turbines that can generate electricity even at wind speeds of 3-4 meters per second or lower. This technological achievement has brought good news to farmers in plains and mountainous areas with low wind speeds and no electricity.

    Additionally, over 5,000 small and medium-sized towns across the country have established biogas purification tanks. Last year, in electricity-scarce rural areas of provinces like Jiangsu and Anhui, farmers built 210,000 biogas systems.

　　农村广辟新能源  风能沼气显神通    
    四百七十万农牧户受益
    本报北京４月２４日讯  据农业部今天透露：我国已有４７８万农牧户、１８００多万农村人口用上了风能和沼气新能源。
    在全国２亿多农户中，目前仍有１／４的农户使用着煤油灯。在这些地方，适应农牧民要求的小型风力发电机和沼气如雨后春笋迅速发展起来。从１９７６年—１９８６年，我国总共发展小型风力发电机１万台。最近３年，风力机猛增７万台。我国科研人员已研制出低风速小型风力发电机，在风速每秒３—４米甚至更低的风速下也能发电。这一科研成果，为风速低而无电的平原、山区农民带来了福音。
    此外，全国已有５０００多中小城镇建立了沼气净化池。去年，在江苏、安徽等省的缺电农村，农民一年就兴建２１万个。
