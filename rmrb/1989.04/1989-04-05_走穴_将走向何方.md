The Beijing Gymnasium, with its 18,000 seats, often displays advertisements for variety shows featuring popular singers. These shows have attractive names and content: popular songs, rock music, jazz dance, breakdancing, and cross-talk, among others, and they generate substantial box office revenues.

Such variety shows typically list one or more organizing units, but in reality, they are often organized by a few individuals. People refer to these performances as "performing on the side" and call the organizers "pit bosses."

The income is astonishingly high

Actors participating in "performing on the side" may belong to a performing arts troupe, or they may be individual cultural entrepreneurs, or even students, teachers, or broadcasters. However, as long as they can sing a song at such a show, they can earn more than the average person.

The amount of income depends on the actor's fame and their relationship with the "pit boss." The highest can earn thousands of yuan for singing one song, while the lowest might only get tens of yuan. However, the exact income figures are often known only to the parties involved.

"Performing on the side" is now widespread in many cities and towns across the country. Some actors perform continuously for several days, while others perform three or four shows in a single day. Thus, there are various rumors about actors' incomes, such as a certain singer earning 200,000 yuan in two months, or another singer demanding 2,000 yuan to perform. Many of these rumors have credible elements, as people often see singers with new motorcycles and luxury cars.

Unlike the actors, "pit bosses" often face financial risks. If a show is successful, a "pit boss" can earn more than ten thousand yuan; but if the show fails or if the stars refuse to perform, they might end up losing money.

The business cards of "pit bosses" often read "Performance Agent," but they can be actors from performing arts troupes, former arts workers, or even employees of enterprises or public institutions. As "pit bosses," they need to have considerable organizational skills and a network of relationships. In short, they are all "capable people."

The public wants to watch performances, and actors want to perform

The pros and cons of "performing on the side" are debated.

One "pit boss" believes that "performing on the side" satisfies the public's hunger for cultural entertainment, allowing people who have long been in remote areas to see their favorite stars. It also increases actors' income. This form of performance can bring together actors from different troupes, different genres, and different styles, creating a rich and colorful program that is very popular with the audience.

An actor who has performed on the side multiple times complains that an actor's artistic career is short, but due to the unique rules of the troupe and other reasons, the number of performances an actor can give in a year is limited. "Performing on the side" provides many actors with the long-awaited opportunity to perform.

At this time of transition between old and new arts management systems, "performing on the side" is inevitable. Over the past decade of reform, the economic income of urban and rural residents has increased significantly, and the demand for culture has also grown rapidly, with a particular preference for comprehensive arts performances. However, the old arts management system is powerless in the face of the rapidly expanding cultural market, and the new system has not yet been established, leading to a severe imbalance between supply and demand. There are more than 3,800 performing arts troupes in the country, with bloated organizations and redundant personnel. The "iron rice bowl" and "big pot" system have caused many performing arts troupes to become half-dead. The common people have nothing to watch, the actors have no money to spend, and those with talent are unwilling to be idle, so the phenomenon of "performing on the side" has emerged in this gap.

There is also an "inverted" situation within the arts community

Although Vice Minister of Culture Ying Ruocheng agrees that "performing on the side" can bring high-quality arts to the grassroots, he emphasizes that the current urgent task is to manage "performing on the side."

Poor management of "performing on the side" has disrupted the normal arts order. Those who hold this view, such as the former director of the Eastern Song and Dance Troupe, Wang Kun, have been calling for strengthened management for several years. Because "performing on the side" can earn several times or even tens of times the monthly salary, many actors are eager to "perform on the side," causing some troupes to be unable to maintain the necessary rehearsals and performances. Some members have even quit their troupes to become "individual performers on the side."

The famous conductor of the Central Orchestra, Li Delun, smiles bitterly and says that musicians can earn 150 to 200 yuan for recording a cassette tape, and if they "perform on the side" 10 times a month, they can earn thousands of yuan, which is several times their monthly salary. The rehearsal and performance fees for the Central Orchestra are only a few yuan, so naturally, some people prefer to "perform on the side."

The high income of "performers on the side" has become one of the hot topics in society. The director of the China Opera and Dance Drama Theater and lyricist, Qiao Yu, sighs deeply: We songwriters earn only tens of yuan for writing a song, but those who sing the songs I write can earn thousands of yuan. I have written songs all my life, but the royalties for these songs are not as much as what some actors earn in two years of "performing on the side." It seems that not only the scientific community, but also our arts community has an "inverted" problem!

A professor from Peking University says: A singer can earn thousands of yuan for singing a popular song, but we work hard for a month and only earn 200 yuan. The difference is too great.

A well-known writer also says: Writers spend years, even decades, writing a novel. The royalties are meager, and the income from a singer singing a few popular songs is equivalent to several novels. This is too unfair.

Carrying the "iron rice bowl" and "performing on the side"

The deputy director of the Central Experimental Drama Theater, Liu Binghuan, calculated an account that revealed the deep-seated problems of "performing on the side": "Performers on the side" generally receive state salaries, enjoy public medical care and low rent, and are carefully trained by the state for several years or even decades. But they often use their work time to go out and "perform on the side." Some actors even use the troupe's props, costumes, or instruments during their "on the side" performances, but most actors do not contribute any of their "on the side" income to the troupe. Some actors perform several shows a day, working very hard, and the "pit boss" tries to lower the standards for meals and accommodation. The actors eat and sleep poorly, and when they return, they need to rest for a while. If they get sick, the troupe still has to pay for their medical expenses. This is obviously unreasonable.

Because "performing on the side" involves cash transactions and lacks financial supervision, "pit bosses" and actors often engage in tax evasion and bribery. Most actors and "pit bosses" do not pay personal income adjustment taxes. A "pit boss" told the reporter that some businessmen directly give the sponsorship money to the "pit boss," who then distributes it. The "pit boss" then has a lot of leeway.

Pros and cons, the key is management

The initial positive significance of "performing on the side" is gradually disappearing. Because the actors are temporarily assembled, they often do not rehearse or rehearse very little, coming and going in a hurry, and with insufficient preparation, the performance quality has been affected, causing a bad impression among the audience. According to a witness from Lanzhou, last September, a few top actors went to Lanzhou to "perform on the side," with ticket prices of 10 yuan each. Due to insufficient preparation, the amplifier malfunctioned, and the audience swarmed onto the stage, questioning the actors. Seeing the situation was not good, the "pit boss" quietly slipped away. Later, with the protection of the public security personnel, the actors were safely withdrawn from the scene.

Currently, popular songs and variety shows are popular in "performing on the side," and other actors are racking their brains to put together some programs to cater to the audience. Some who are originally Peking opera actors insist on singing popular songs, making people laugh and cry. Some performances have low taste and vulgar content.

The "performing on the side" on the stage of arts is becoming more and more intense, but simply and rudely banning it is not a good strategy. If the government's cultural management departments and arts troupes can actively support and manage this new phenomenon in a timely manner, "performing on the side" may become more beneficial than harmful.

The China Acrobatics Troupe had a "performing on the side" craze a year ago, with 90% of the troupe's actors unwilling to rehearse and going out to make money. At the end of 1987, the troupe began reforms, strengthened management, and formulated specific management regulations. The situation improved rapidly. The troupe, on the one hand, stipulated that the income distribution ratio is slightly better than that of other actors. On the other hand, it stipulated that actors, when there is no work arrangement in the troupe, can "perform on the side" during their free time, but they must fill out an application form and obtain approval from the troupe before being issued a performance certificate. "Performing on the side" income is 30% for the troupe and 70% for the individual. If private performances and private distributions are found, the entire income will be confiscated at the lightest, and at the heaviest, the actor will be dismissed. The Acrobatics Troupe has enhanced its cohesion, shown vitality, and actors are rehearsing in an orderly manner.

After the performance troupes gradually implement the dual-track system, a large number of art academies and troupes will be run by society. Therefore, relying solely on performances in cities or waiting for audiences to come is not enough. One must go out to seek and develop the cultural market. At that time, most actors will become genuine freelancers, and thus, "cultural agents" will become an objective need. For the "underground" "pit bosses," they should be selectively invited out, and the government should issue them business licenses and strengthen organizational management. For famous actors who are also "pit bosses," they should also be registered and managed. If a complete set of "cultural agent" management regulations can be formulated, and at the same time, a perfect financial and tax system can be implemented, turning hidden accounts into transparent ones. The taxes collected can be used to support high-quality, serious arts creation and performance. In this way, many "pit bosses" will become the first batch of legal "cultural agents" on Chinese soil. They understand management, are good at capturing cultural market information, understand the internal relationships of troupes, can widely connect with various aspects of society, and are skilled in ticket sales. They are organizers, promoters, and operators of arts performances with a future.

Of course, it should also be emphasized that actors are disseminators of spiritual civilization and should have a certain level of ideological awareness and cultivation, rather than becoming money-worshipping materialists. The famous film director Xie Jin once praised the actors of the Beijing People's Art Theater: They should be said to have good conditions for "performing on the side," but some actors are very difficult to invite, because many actors of the Beijing People's Art Theater have a spirit of devotion to art and are not tempted by money. This sense of mission is very precious.

### “走穴”将走向何方

　　“走穴”将走向何方
    新华社记者  张宝瑞  王岳龙
    拥有１．８万个座位的首都体育馆门前常常竖起综合文艺晚会的广告牌，上面写满了当今走红的流行歌星的名字。这些晚会都有优美的名称和颇具吸引力的内容：通俗歌曲、摇滚乐、柔姿舞、霹雳舞、相声等，票房收入极为可观。
    这样的文艺晚会都对外标明一个或几个主办单位，实际上，晚会大多是由某几个人组织的。人们把这样的文艺演出称为“走穴”，把“走穴”的组织者称为“穴头”。
    收入之高令人咋舌
    参与“走穴”的演员有的属于某文艺团体，有的却是文化个体户，也有的甚至是学生、教师或播音员，但只要能在这样的晚会上高歌一曲，便可以获得高于常人的收入。
    收入的多寡既看演员的知名度，也看他和“穴头”的关系。多的，唱一首歌的报酬可达数千元；少的，才值几十元。但具体收入的数字，往往是“你知、我知、天地知”。
    “走穴”现在遍及全国许多城市乡镇。有的演员一连数日奔波演出，有的一天连赶三四场以上。于是，关于演员的收入有着种种传闻，例如：传说一名歌星两个月内便获得２０万元，××歌星，不给够２０００元就不出场……其中有不少可信的因素，因为人们常可见到歌星们新买的摩托车和豪华型轿车。
    与“走穴”演员不同，“穴头”们常常担着收入上的风险，倘若演出“爆棚”，“穴头”也可捞到万元以上；倘若经营不利或遇到明星们“撂场”，也可能“赔了夫人又折兵”。
    “穴头”们递来的名片上赫然标着“演出经纪人×××”，但他们有的是文艺团体的演员，有的是吃过文艺饭的闲散人员，也有的在企、事业单位供职。但作为“穴头”，就要有相当的活动能力，和演员们互相利用，四面八方关系“网络化”。总之，他们确实都是些“能人”。
    百姓要看戏，演员想演戏
    “走穴”的利弊之争，莫衷一是。
    “穴头”××认为，“走穴”满足了群众对文化娱乐饥渴般的要求，使长期避居山乡边城的人们一睹渴慕已久的名角的风采，同时使演员增加了收入。“走穴”这一形式，可以汇集不同剧团、不同行当、不同风格的演员于一台，组成丰富多彩的文艺节目，极受观众的欢迎。
    一位多次“走穴”的演员抱怨说，演员的艺术生涯很短，但由于剧团本身特殊的规律及其它原因，一年上台演出的时间很少。“走穴”给不少演员提供了朝思暮想的演出实践机会。
    在我国新旧文艺体制交替之际，“走穴”确实难以避免。改革１０年来，城乡人民的经济收入有了显著增长，人民群众的文化需求也随之大为增长，对综合性的文艺演出形式尤为喜爱。而旧的文艺体制在迅速扩大的文化市场面前显得苍白无力，同时新的文艺体制尚未确立，文艺供求严重不平衡。全国有３８００多个文艺团体，机构臃肿，人浮于事，“铁饭碗”和“大锅饭”使许多文艺团体出现半死不活的状况。老百姓没戏看，演员没钱花，有本事的不甘寂寞，于是在这个缝隙中，“走穴”的现象便应运而生。
    文艺界内部也有“倒挂”
    文化部主管文艺团体的副部长英若诚虽然同意“走穴”可以把高质量的文艺带到基层的说法，但他强调，目前急需解决的是对“走穴”的管理。
    “走穴”的管理不善，已冲击了正常的文艺秩序。持这一观点的原东方歌舞团团长王昆几年来一直疾呼要强化管理。由于“走穴”能获取比月工资高几倍或几十倍的收入，许多演员争相“走穴”，致使一些剧团已无法维持必需的排练和演出。有的团员甚至退团，成为“走穴个体户”。
    中央乐团著名指挥李德伦苦笑着说，乐手录一次盒式音乐带可获利１５０元至２００元，一个月“走穴”１０次便是上千元，比月工资高出几倍。中央乐团的排练演出费才几元，相比之下，当然有人愿意“走穴”。
    “走穴”者的高额收入已成为社会的热门话题之一。中国歌剧舞剧院院长、词作家乔羽感慨万千：我们写歌的一次只收入十几元钱，而唱我写的歌，却可以得到上千元。我写了一辈子歌，这些稿费加起来，也不如个别演员“走穴”两年得到的多。看来不光科技界，我们文艺界也有个倒挂问题呀！
    北京大学一位教授说：“一个歌星唱一首流行歌曲就能拿几千元，我们辛辛苦苦干一个月才有２００多元，相比之下，差距甚大。”
    一位知名作家也说：“作家呕心沥血写一部长篇小说，需要几年、十几年甚至几十年的辛勤积累。稿费的收入又较微薄，一个歌星唱几首流行歌曲所得的收入，就相当于几部长篇小说。这未免太不公平了。”
    端着“铁饭碗”“走穴”
    中央实验话剧院院长助理刘炳环算了一笔帐，揭示了“走穴”的深层弊端：“‘走穴’”演员一般拿着国家的工资，享受着公费医疗和低房租等待遇，受到国家几年或几十年的精心培养。但他们多是利用工作时间出外“走穴”，有的演员在“走穴”演出中还要用团里的道具、服装或乐器，可是多数演员的“走穴”收入一点也不交剧团。有的演员一天演好几场，累得够呛，“穴头”又尽量压低伙食、住宿标准，演员吃不好、睡不好，回来要休息一段时间，生了病，还得剧团报销医药费。这显然是不合理的。
    由于“走穴”是现款现分，没有财务制度监督，“穴头”和演员偷税漏税、行贿受贿严重。多数演员和“穴头”不交个人收入调节税。有个“穴头”告诉记者，有的企业家直接把赞助现款交给“穴头”，由“穴头”去分，那“穴头”的“猫腻”就大了。
    利弊消长，关键在管理
    “走穴”在初期显示的积极意义渐已开始消失。由于“走穴”演员是临时拼凑的，往往不排练或很少排练，来去匆匆，加上准备工作不足，已影响了演出质量，在群众中造成不良影响。据兰州来的一位目击者讲，去年９月，北京有几个尖子演员到兰州“走穴”，票价１０元一张，由于准备工作不足，扩音器出了毛病，观众蜂拥上台，质问演员。“穴头”见势不妙，悄悄溜走。后来在公安人员的保护下，演员才安全撤出现场。
    目前，流行歌曲、曲艺等在“走穴”中走红，其他行当的演员便绞尽脑汁拼凑一些节目，来迎合观众。有的本来是京剧演员，却偏偏要唱流行歌曲，使人啼笑皆非。有的表演格调不高，内容粗俗。
    文艺舞台上的“走穴”愈演愈烈，然而简单粗暴地取缔、禁止绝非上策。对于这样新出现的事，如果政府文化主管部门和文艺团体能够及时地积极扶持和管理，“走穴”就可能利大于弊。
    中国杂技团在一年前“走穴”成风，全团９０％的演员无心排练、外出挣钱。１９８７年底，这个团开始进行改革，加强了管理，制订了具体的管理条例，局面迅速改观。团里一方面规定，在收入分成比例上略优于其他演员。另一方面规定，演员在团里无工作安排的，空闲时间可以“走穴”，但必须填写申请表，经团部批准后发给演出证。“走穴”收入３０％归团里，７０％归个人。若发现私演私分，轻则没收其全部收入，重则解聘。杂技团增强了凝聚力，出现了生机，演员排演紧张有序。
    在表演团体逐步实行双轨制后，大量的艺术院、团将由社会来办。因此，仅靠在城市演出或坐等观众上门就不行了，只有走出去寻求和开拓文化市场。而那时，多数演员将成为名副其实的自由职业者，这样，“文化经纪人”就成为客观的需要。对于“地下”的“穴头”，要有选择地把他们请出来，政府发给他们营业证，并加强组织管理。对于名演员兼职的“穴头”，也要登记管理。能否制订出完备的“文化经纪人”管理条例，同时配合以完善的财务、税收制度，变暗帐为明帐。所征得的税利，可以用于扶植高质量的、严肃的文艺创作和演出。这样，许多“穴头”将成为中国大地上成长起来的第一批合法“文化经纪人”，他们懂得经营管理，善于捕捉文化市场信息，懂得剧团内部关系，能广泛联系社会各方，精于推销门票，是文艺演出的有前途的组织者、宣传者和经营者。
    当然还应强调的是，演员是精神文明的传播者，要有一定的思想觉悟和修养，而不能成为唯利是图的拜金者。著名电影导演谢晋曾盛赞北京人艺演员：应该说他们“走穴”的条件不错，有些演员却很难请得动，因为人艺的不少演员对艺术有一种献身精神，不为金钱所惑，这种事业心是非常可贵的。
