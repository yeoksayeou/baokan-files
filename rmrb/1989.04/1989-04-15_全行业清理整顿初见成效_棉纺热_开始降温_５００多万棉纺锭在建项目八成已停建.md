	The nationwide rectification and cleanup of construction projects in the textile industry have begun to show results, and the "cotton spinning fever" is starting to cool down. According to preliminary statistics from relevant departments, out of the 500 million cotton spindles in construction projects nationwide, over 400 million have been halted for review, while nearly 100 million are still under construction.

	In recent years, many regions have seen severe overbuilding of small and medium-sized cotton spinning mills outside of planned projects. By the end of 1988, the country already had over 31 million spindles, far exceeding the planned amount for the "Seventh Five-Year Plan." Of the 10 million spindles constructed in 1988, only 1.5 million were part of the planned projects; of the 5 million spindles that were completed and put into production that year, 4.6 million were outside of the planned projects. Most of the newly built small mills used equipment discarded by large mills or substandard equipment produced by non-designated factories, resulting in poor quality and high consumption. Due to the significant shortage of cotton for textile use nationwide, many local small textile mills have had an advantage, able to operate at full capacity; meanwhile, some large, technologically advanced key enterprises in coastal cities have been operating at half capacity, severely impacting the quality of textile products and overall economic efficiency nationwide.

	Since the end of last year, the State Council and relevant ministries have dispatched inspection teams to various provinces and cities twice, working with local departments to inspect construction projects. Following the principle of "halt first, clean up later, no new projects," a large number of projects have been halted, with the majority in provinces like Jiangsu, Shandong, and Hebei.

	Relevant departments have pointed out that currently, some local officials are still observing the rectification and cleanup of newly built cotton spinning mills, fearing that reducing projects will result in losses; some have difficulties and a lucky mindset regarding the reduction of funded projects; and some places even have projects that are halted on paper but continue in practice. These issues cannot be taken lightly. To thoroughly reduce the number of cotton spinning mill construction projects, significant effort and force are still needed.

### 全行业清理整顿初见成效　“棉纺热”开始降温　５００多万棉纺锭在建项目八成已停建

　　全行业清理整顿初见成效
　　“棉纺热”开始降温
　　５００多万棉纺锭在建项目八成已停建
    本报讯　记者李茜报道：全国纺织工业清理整顿基建项目初见成效，“棉纺热”开始降温。据有关部门初步统计，全国５００多万棉纺锭在建项目，已有４００多万锭停建等待清理，另有近１００万锭仍在建设。
    近两年，许多地区计划外中小棉纺厂重复建设情况严重。到１９８８年底，全国已拥有３１００多万纱锭，大大超过“七五”计划规定的数量。在１９８８年建设的１０００万纱锭中，计划内的只有１５０万纱锭；当年建成投产的５００万纱锭中，计划外的就有４６０万锭。多数新建小厂都是采用大厂淘汰下来的设备或非定点厂生产的不合格设备，质量差，消耗高。由于全国纺织用棉缺口较大，许多地方建的中小纺织厂“近水楼台先得月”，可以吃饱吃好；沿海城市一些技术水平高的大型骨干企业则处于半饥饿状态，严重影响了全国纺织工业的产品质量和宏观经济效益。
    去年年底以来，国务院和有关部委先后两次派检查组到各省市，会同当地有关部门检查基建项目，本着“先停后清，先死后活，不开口子”的精神，停建了一大批项目，其中以江苏、山东、河北等省居多。
    有关部门指出，目前有些地区的干部对清理整顿新建棉纺厂仍在观望，怕压缩冒尖了吃亏；有人对压缩集资项目有畏难情绪和侥幸心理；甚至有的地方有明停暗不停的情况。对上述问题不能掉以轻心，要彻底把棉纺厂的在建项目压缩下来，还需要花大功夫，下大力气。
