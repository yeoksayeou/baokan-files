Ten Theater Troupes Gather in Nanjing for the First Small Theater Drama Festival

	Nanjing, April 20 (This reporter, Yi Kai) — Just as large-scale theater is facing a serious challenge, a wave of small theater art has quietly risen in many major cities across China in recent years. This wave converged today at the opening of the "Nanjing Small Theater Drama Festival."

	The festival, which will run for 11 days, features 14 small theater plays from 10 leading theater troupes from across the country. These plays vividly record the brief history of the small theater movement in China. Among them, Beijing People's Art Theatre's "Absolute Signal" is hailed as the pioneering work of China's small theater; Qingyuan Art Theatre's "Fire God and Autumn Girl" and "Social Image" have both received positive reviews from the public. The Southern War Theater Troupe's "Life's Inequality" and "Building Blocks" from the South are unique; the Northern Forestry Art Troupe from Yichun, Heilongjiang, presents "The Journey of Desire," bringing news of the small theater movement at the grassroots level. Shanghai's four plays are more experimental: Shanghai People's Art Theatre's "Honest Deal" is a recent work directed by veteran director Huang Zuolin; Shanghai Youth Theatre's "The Owl in the House" openly proclaims itself as avant-garde theater. The four plays from the host city, Nanjing, also have their own characteristics. Nanjing Municipal Theatre and Jiangsu Provincial Theatre's collaborative production "Ducks Flying in the Sky" is full of contemporary charm.

	Concurrently with the Small Theater Drama Festival, the National Small Theater Art Theory Seminar will discuss and analyze the direction of this new style and trend of Chinese theater that emerged in the 1980s.

　　十支话剧劲旅会师南京     
    首届小剧场戏剧节开幕
    本报南京４月２０日讯  记者易凯报道：正当话剧大剧场艺术面临现实严峻挑战之际，一股小剧场艺术的涌流近年却在我国许多大城市悄悄兴起。这股涌流于今天在南京开幕的“南京小剧场戏剧节”上汇成一股新潮。
    参加为期１１天的“南京小剧场戏剧节”的有来自我国南北十支话剧劲旅，他们带来的１４台小剧场话剧，形象地记录了我国话剧小剧场运动发生发展的短暂历史。其中，北京人艺的《绝对信号》被誉为我国小剧场的“开山之作”；青艺的《火神与秋女》、《社会形象》均获社会好评；来自南国的战士话剧团的《人生不等式》、《搭积木》别有新意；北国林区伊春林业文工团话剧团演出的《欲望的旅程》则带来了小剧场运动在基层活动的信息。上海的４台戏更具实验性质：上海人艺的《童叟无欺》，是老导演黄佐临新近执导的力作；上海青年话剧团的《屋里的猫头鹰》则公开打出了先锋戏剧的旗号。来自东道主南京的４台戏也各有特点。南京市话剧团与江苏省话剧团合作的《天上飞的鸭子》充满了时代情趣。
    与小剧场戏剧节同时召开的全国小剧场艺术理论研讨会，将对这股８０年代兴起的我国话剧运动的新样式、新潮流的走向，在理论上予以探讨和把握。
