Gold is the most valuable thing; the troops searching for gold embody the most valuable spirit!

In the vast forests and endless snowfields, there is a special force far removed from modern material civilization and enjoyment. Few people know or understand this force. Yet it is they—the Third Gold Brigade of the People's Armed Police of China—who have been active in a high-altitude cold region spanning thousands of square kilometers for a decade! They have surveyed the distribution of gold mines in over 140 rivers, large and small, and have exceeded the national gold reserve exploration plan. At the 1987 National Gold Work Conference, they were commended. The Armed Police Gold Brigade, which makes up 1/10 of the national gold geological exploration force, completed 1/3 of the national exploration reserves during the Sixth Five-Year Plan.

The geological section chief of the brigade, Tian Lu, is a slim and agile old man. He has a special fondness for geological work and has even paid out of his own pocket to send several of his children to study geology and surveying. After graduation, most of them work in the Third Brigade and local geological teams. He often repeats, "I don't hope for promotions, I don't want to get rich, I just want to find more mines for the country."

Most of the brigade's technical personnel are graduates from geological schools in the 1970s. Yang Guojie is 30 years old this year and has drilled in the Great Khingan Mountains for 10 years. His wife works in a geological workers' hospital in Mudanjiang. They got married in 1985, but in the past three years, the young couple have been together for less than four months; their two-year-old son, Yang Shuai, still doesn't recognize his father!

Last March, the Third Brigade's First Company marched into the Xikouzi exploration area. Xikouzi is located northwest of Beiji Village and Mohe, in the middle reaches of the Ergun River. At that time, the temperature was below -30 degrees Celsius. A convoy carrying over 100 tons of equipment and supplies was moving across the frozen river. The convoy encountered double-layered ice, and suddenly, a tractor broke through the first layer of ice and got stuck more than a meter deep in the water under the second layer of ice. The only way to pull it out was to have someone dive into the water to attach a tow rope. Into the ice layer! Without a word, six soldiers removed their hats and stripped off their coats, cotton clothes, cotton pants, and boots, took a swig of alcohol, and took turns diving into the icy water. Once, twice, three times, until the twentieth time, they finally attached the tow rope. The tractor was pulled out, and our soldiers were frozen stiff.

In Xikouzi, they set up a camp, and the weather gradually warmed up, melting the ice on the river and cutting off all transportation with the outside world. The soldiers began a seven-month-long wilderness exploration and construction on this "island" isolated from the world. Here, there is no television, no newspapers to read, and not even a radio to pick up the central station's signal. All mail communication with family members was cut off. The only way to contact the brigade was through scheduled telegrams. After months of wilderness operations, the soldiers ate all the dried vegetables, ate wild vegetables, and often had a meal of pickled radishes. At night, they slept in damp, cold tents.

During the day, everyone worked tirelessly, and by night, under candlelight, they didn't know what to do. The books and magazines they brought were worn out, and the playing cards were broken. On this "island," besides wandering in the mountains, where else could they go? And once away from their comrades who shared life and death, they felt even more lonely. But this did not shake their resolve to find gold. The country is vast, and there are many things to do. The soldiers of the Third Brigade understand that all this must be achieved through labor and creation. They just hope that one day, the motherland will truly become rich and strong! And they are willing to be a gleaming grain of gold sand, laying down one small brick at a time.

　　十年黄金路
　　戴天
    黄金，最有价值的东西；寻找黄金的部队，体现了最有价值的精神！
    莽莽林海、茫茫雪原，有一支远离现代物质文明与享受的特种部队。很少有人知道、了解这支部队。然而正是他们——中国人民武装警察部队黄金第三支队，活跃在方圆上千平方公里的高寒区，奋斗了１０个年头！他们摸清了１４０多条大小河流内金矿的分布情况，超额完成了国家下达的黄金储量勘探计划。在１９８７年全国黄金工作会议上受到了通令表彰。武警黄金支队，占全国黄金地质勘探大军的１／１０，“六五”期间，却完成了全国１／３的勘探储量。
    支队地质股股长田录，是个瘦小精悍的老头。他对地质工作有一种特殊的偏爱，不惜自费把几个孩子送往地质和测量学校学习，毕业后，又大多在三支队和地方地质队工作。他时常重复着，我不盼升官，不想发财，只想为国家多找矿。
    支队的技术人员中，多是７０年代地质院校的毕业生。杨国杰今年３０岁，在大兴安岭钻了１０年林子。他爱人在牡丹江一所地质职工医院工作。１９８５年结婚至今，小夫妻俩３年在一起相伴不足４个月；两岁的儿子杨帅，至今还认不准自己的爸爸！
    去年３月，三支队一连进军西口子勘探区。西口子地处北极村漠河西北，额尔古纳河的中游。当时，气温在零下３０多摄氏度，拉着１００多吨装备给养的车队，行进在冰冻的江面上。车队遇上了二层冰，突然，一台拖拉机压碎了第一层冰，卡在了１米多深水下的第二层冰上。唯一的办法是用另一台拖拉机把它拉出来，但必须有人潜到水中去挂牵引绳。下冰层！６名战士二话没说，摘下皮帽脱了大衣、棉衣棉裤大头鞋，一仰脖，喝口酒，轮流扎进冰水中。一次，两次，三次，直到二十几次才挂上了牵引绳。拖拉机被拽上来了，我们的战士也冻僵了。
    在西口子扎下营寨，天也渐渐转暖，江上冰层融化，矿区与外界的一切交通中断了。战士们就在这与世隔绝的“孤岛”上，开始了长达七个月的野外勘探施工。这里看不到电视，读不到报纸，连收音机也收不到中央台的声音。与家人的书信往来全部中断。唯一能与支队联系的就是定时电报。几个月的野外作业，战士们吃完了干菜，吃野菜，常常盐水泡婆婆丁就是一顿午餐。晚上睡在潮湿、寒冷的帐篷中。
    白天，大家拚命地干活，到了晚上，在烛光下，不知干啥好。捎去的书刊翻烂了，带去的扑克也玩碎了。在这“孤岛”上，除了在山林中乱钻，能去哪儿呢？而且一离开生死与共的战友，就更加感到孤独。但这些没有动摇他们找矿的决心。国家大，事情多。三支队的指战员们理解，这一切，都要靠劳动、靠创造去争取。他们只是想，有一天，祖国能真正的富强起来！而他们则甘愿做一粒闪闪发光的金砂，铺下一块又一块小小的基石。
