The leadership's power struggles, frequent use of performance-enhancing drugs, and the proliferation of world-class tournaments have created a sad state of affairs in the world of professional boxing today.

The disunity among international boxing organizations is severe, and power is becoming increasingly fragmented. In addition to the original three major world organizations—the World Boxing Association, the World Boxing Council, and the International Boxing Federation—another entity, the World Boxing Organization, has recently split off. Although it has not yet gained international recognition, it has already begun organizing its world championship matches and setting up qualifying rounds. This devalues the world championship, with each weight class having four world champions, making it difficult for people to determine who the true world champion is.

　　职业拳坛紊乱不堪
    领导层的权力之争，服用兴奋剂屡屡发生，世界级大赛名目繁多，构成了当今世界拳击运动的可悲图像。
    世界性拳击组织严重不和，权力日益分散。职业拳击除原三大世界性组织——世界拳击协会、世界拳击理事会和国际拳击联合会外，新近又分裂出第四个机构——世界拳击组织。尽管它还没获得国际承认，但却已经开始组织它的世界冠军赛和配设升级赛。这使世界冠军逐渐贬值，每一级别都有四个世界冠军，人们无从判断谁是真正的世界冠军。
