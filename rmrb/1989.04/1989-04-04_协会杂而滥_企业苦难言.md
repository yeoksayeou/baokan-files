Title: Too Many Associations Burden Enterprises

A reporter recently visited the Changcheng Special Steel Company in Sichuan and learned that the company's management had complained about the numerous associations (including academic societies) that enterprises are required to join. The reporter found that there are two main issues with these associations:

First, there are too many of them. Changcheng alone is a member of 47 associations under the Metallurgical Ministry. Some of these associations perform partial government functions, making it necessary for enterprises to join. For example, the Quality Management Society must approve a company's high-quality products before they can be recognized.

Second, there is uncertainty about how to allocate funds for membership fees and who should set the fee standards. Last year, Changcheng paid 230,000 yuan in membership fees, which were deducted from the company's management expenses. However, higher authorities deemed this practice to be in violation of financial procedures, resulting in a 230,000 yuan fine for the company.

The company's management believes that associations play a significant role in fostering horizontal connections and enhancing information exchange. However, the sheer number of associations also places a heavy burden on enterprises. They suggest that relevant state departments should promptly formulate regulations to clarify which types of associations can be established and how membership fees should be allocated, providing enterprises with clear guidelines to follow.

### 协会杂而滥　企业苦难言

　　协会杂而滥　企业苦难言
    记者日前在四川长城特殊钢公司采访时，该公司负责人反映，目前各种协会（含学会）名目繁多，企业应接不暇。
    据了解，协会主要有两个问题：
    一是数量太多。长钢参加的仅冶金部系统的协会就有４７个，其中一些协会行使部分政府机关职能，因此不能不参加。比如，质量管理学会，公司创优质产品，不经这个学会认可就不行。
    二是会费不知从何列支、收费标准该由谁确定。长钢去年共交２３万元会费，从企业管理费用中列支，但上级有关部门认为这不合财务手续，因此被罚款２３万元。
    该公司负责人认为，协会在开展横向联系、加强信息交流等方面确实发挥了不少作用，但众多的协会也给企业增加了负担。他们建议国家有关部门尽快制订有关条文，明确规定什么样的协会可以成立，会费应从何列支，让企业有章可依。
