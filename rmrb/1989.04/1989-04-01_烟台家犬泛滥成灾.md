The number of household dogs in Yantai City, Shandong Province, has reached 500,000, which is half of the city's total pig population. This has brought two major problems to society: first, it consumes a large amount of grain. 500,000 dogs consume nearly 150 million kilograms of grain per year, which is almost equivalent to the amount of grain Yantai imports from other places each year. Second, it directly threatens public safety. In 1988, more than 6,400 people were bitten by vicious dogs in the city, and 24 people died from rabies.

The Yantai Municipal Government recently issued a notice on strengthening the management of dogs and preventing rabies. Starting from March, all household dogs in the city will be required to be registered, kept in cages, and tied up. Vaccinations for dogs will be carried out, and all dogs kept in violation of regulations will be captured and killed.

　　烟台家犬泛滥成灾
    本报烟台三月三十一日电  山东省烟台市家犬数量已经达到五十万只，是全市生猪存养量的一半。这给社会带来两大危害：一是消耗大量粮食，五十万只狗一年耗粮接近一点五亿公斤，基本相当于烟台每年从外地调进的粮食；二是直接威胁群众的安全。一九八八年，全市被恶犬咬伤六千四百多人，因狂犬病发作死亡二十四人。
    烟台市政府最近发布了关于加强犬只管理、防治狂犬病的通告，从三月起，对全市家犬实行挂牌圈养、拴养；搞好犬只免疫；违章养的犬全部捕杀。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（门世臣）
