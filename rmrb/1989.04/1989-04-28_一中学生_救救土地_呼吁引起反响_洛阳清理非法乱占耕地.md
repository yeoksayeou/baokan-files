Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, April 28th. (Reporters Chen Zhaozhong, Correspondent Kong Deyi) The appeal by a middle school student from the suburbs of Luoyang to "save the land" published in the newspapers has sparked a strong response in Luoyang, with relevant departments taking action to clean up illegally occupied arable land.

On April 13th, the Luoyang Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection held a teleconference, announcing the decision of the Municipal Committee to include the prevention of officials at all levels from illegally occupying arable land to build private houses as a major component of clean governance. This will also be an important criterion for the assessment and use of officials.

The Luoyang Municipal Land Management Office has also assigned specific personnel to form inspection teams to investigate the land occupation issues across the city's 9 counties and 6 districts. By April 10th, the first batch of 5 inspection teams had been dispatched to Luanchuan County, Song County, Xin'an County, Yiyang County, and the suburban district, respectively, to thoroughly investigate cases of officials illegally approving and occupying arable land, illegal land occupation for housing construction, and villages violating policies to approve residential plots. By mid-April, the village where the student resides, Liuhang Village, had verified the 121 residential plots approved since 1985. The results showed that 35 of these plots did not meet the approval conditions, and the inspection team immediately decided to reclaim these 35 illegal plots.

Inspired by the student's letter, the district committee and government of Luoyang's suburban district formulated measures to clean up dual-income households building private houses in urban areas within a set timeframe. The measures clearly stipulate: the construction of private houses must be halted immediately; those who have already built private houses must vacate public housing and are not allowed to rent out private houses; for those whose construction costs obviously exceed their personal income, the source of funds must be explained, and relevant departments must thoroughly clarify and handle the cases accordingly.

　　一中学生“救救土地”呼吁引起反响    
    洛阳清理非法乱占耕地
    新华社郑州４月２８日电（记者陈朝中、通讯员孔德义）洛阳市郊区一名中学生写给市委书记武振国呼吁“救救土地”的信见诸报端后，一石激起千层浪，在洛阳市引起强烈反响，有关部门正着手清理非法乱占耕地。
    ４月１３日，洛阳市纪律检查委员会召开电话会议，宣布市委决定，把反对各级干部乱占耕地建私房作为廉政建设的一项主要内容，并作为考核、使用干部的重要条件。
    洛阳市土地管理办公室还抽专人组成检查组，对全市９县６区的建房占地问题进行清查，４月１０日第一批５个检查组已分别奔赴栾川县、嵩县、新安县、宜阳县和郊区，分别对一些干部乱批乱占耕地、违法占地建房和各乡、村违犯政策乱批宅基地等一一进行认真清查。到４月中旬，这位中学生所在的柳行村对自１９８５年以来批给１２１户的宅基地进行了核实，结果，发现有３５户不符合审批条件，清查小组当即决定收回了这３５户的违法占地。
    洛阳市郊区区委、区政府从这位中学生的信受到启发，制定了限期清理双职工在城镇建造私人住宅的措施，明确规定：正在建造的私房一律停止；已经建有私房的要退出公房，不允许占公房出租私房；对建房费用明显超过本人收入的要交待清楚资金来源，有关部门要彻底澄清，分别处理。
