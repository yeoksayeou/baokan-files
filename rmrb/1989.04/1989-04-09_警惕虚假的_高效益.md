Title: Beware of False "High Efficiency"

At the end and beginning of the year, many enterprises reported "high efficiency" for 1988, with significant increases in realized profits, and were in high spirits. However, some economists pointed out that the economic environment in 1988 was quite special, and the high efficiency of some enterprises might be inflated. Currently, the statistical scope for output value is calculated based on 1980 prices, while taxes and profits are calculated based on current prices, making the two incomparable.

The economic efficiency of enterprises in 1988 needs to be analyzed specifically. Some enterprises' efficiency is false. Among them, one type is the "price increase efficiency type." These enterprises complain about the large increase in raw material prices, but their product price increases are even larger. At the same time, enterprise behavior has undergone new changes, shifting from individual enterprises raising prices to monopolistic price increases within the same industry, thus easily obtaining a large chunk of efficiency without much effort. Another type is the "speed efficiency type." After the buying spree in 1988, some factories took the opportunity to offload accumulated inventory and simultaneously ramped up production, causing an abnormally high speed.

Some enterprises, in the face of false "high efficiency," are complacent and have relaxed their efforts to seek efficiency through internal improvements. Instead, they focus on blindly expanding production and raising product prices, laying the groundwork for the next round of price increases. Currently, enterprise contracting and leasing generally only involve realizing profits, without considering the extent of product price increases or the tax rate per 100 yuan of capital. This objectively leads enterprises to pursue product price increases rather than genuinely seeking economic efficiency. The state should improve the performance indicators for enterprise contracting and leasing to guide enterprises towards a path of low input and high output.

### 警惕虚假的“高效益”

　　警惕虚假的“高效益”
    岁末年初，不少企业为１９８８年出现了“高效益”，实现利润大幅度增长而喜气洋洋。然而，一些经济研究部门的人士指出，１９８８年的经济环境具有很大的特殊性，有些企业的高效益水分可能很大。目前的统计口径，产值是以１９８０年的不变价计算的，而利税按现行价计算，两者之间没有可比性。
    对于１９８８年的企业经济效益要作具体分析。有些企业的效益是虚假的，其中，一类是“涨价效益型”。这类企业叫嚷原材料价格上涨幅度大，可是他们的产品涨价幅度更大。同时企业行为出现了新的变化，由过去个别企业涨价向同行业垄断性涨价发展，于是，不费力便得来一大块效益。另一类是“速度效益型”。１９８８年出现抢购风后，一些工厂乘机把积压产品“大泻肚”，同时又开足马力生产，造成速度非正常加快。
    有些企业在虚假的“高效益”面前沾沾自喜，放松了向内部挖潜求效益，而是把眼睛盯在盲目扩大再生产上，盯在产品提价上，为下一轮涨价埋下了种子。目前，企业承包、租赁，一般都是只包实现利润，不包产品提价幅度，不包百元资金利税率，这客观上造成企业追求产品涨价，不注重获取真正的经济效益。国家应当改进企业承包、租赁的考核指标，促使企业真正走低投入高产出的经营道路。
