	Book critics propose guiding readers to higher levels

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing (Reporter Li Guangru) Some people have defended the proliferation of mediocre publications, claiming that there is a large demand for them. However, book critics who gathered in Beijing on April 20th do not see it this way. They propose that the key lies in strengthening book review work to guide readers to continuously reach higher levels.

	Currently, there are 6,066 periodicals and 502 publishing houses nationwide, with over 60,000 books published last year. To help readers sift through the vast array of publications and select the best, the Publicity Department of the Central Committee, some newspapers, universities, and publishing houses have done a lot of work in recent years, promoting the development of book review activities nationwide.

	The development practices of various countries have shown that the development of the publishing industry often goes hand in hand with book review work. During discussions on the strengths and weaknesses of domestic book review work, book critics noted that the current state of book reviews is not entirely satisfactory, particularly lacking high-quality, lively, and engaging "introductory" articles.

	To enhance the guiding and supervisory roles of book reviews, after deliberation and approval, a nationwide academic organization—the Chinese Book Review Association—was established on April 20th. The attendees elected Wu Jie as the president and Liu Tao, Shen Changwen, and others as vice presidents.

　　图书评论家提出    
    要引导读者走向高层次
    新华社北京电（记者李光茹）有人曾为平庸书刊泛滥辩护：那是因为有大量需求。４月２０日在此间聚会的图书评论家们却不这样看。他们提出，关键之一在于加强书评工作，引导读者不断走向高层次。
    全国现有期刊６０６６种，出版社５０２家，去年出书达６万多种。为帮助读者在众多出版物中去芜取精，中宣部出版局、一些报刊、高校和出版社近几年做了不少工作，推动了全国图书评论活动的开展。
    各国的发展实践证明，出版业发展往往与书评工作相携而行。书评家们在畅谈国内书评工作得失时认为，书评现状不尽如人意，尤其缺乏高质量、生动活泼的“导读”文章。
    为发挥书评的引导和舆论监督作用，经过酝酿和批准，一个全国性的群众学术团体——中国图书评论学会４月２０日成立。与会代表推举伍杰为会长，刘杲、沈昌文等为副会长。
