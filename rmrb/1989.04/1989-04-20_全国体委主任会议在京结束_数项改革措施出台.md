The National Sports Commission Directors' Meeting concluded in Beijing today. Several reform measures were introduced.

The People's Daily, Beijing, April 20th — Reporter Wāng Dàzhāo reports: Wu Shaozu, who has been in office for only three months as the head of the State Sports Commission, expressed his satisfaction with the six-day meeting that concluded this afternoon. He believes that, in the context of the lively ideological atmosphere within and outside the sports community, the meeting did not shy away from contradictions. It discussed many issues of concern to the public in a comprehensive manner, exchanged information and ideas, and reached a consensus on many issues.

Wu Shaozu summarized the strategic slogan for China's sports community as: widely promote mass sports activities, improve competitive sports levels, improve sports facilities, strengthen education and research, and strive to achieve the goal of becoming a world sports power.

The evaluation of China's current sports situation and the performance of Chinese athletes at the Seoul Olympics, which has been a topic of much debate, was also clarified at this meeting. Wu Shaozu does not agree with the phrase "defeated in Seoul." He believes that the results achieved by Chinese athletes at the Seoul Olympics are consistent with their own strength. Some projects did not perform ideally and suffered defeats, which should be seen as common in military strategies and the mother of success. A fair evaluation should be made. In fact, the Chinese women's volleyball team and table tennis team are both working hard to regain their former glory. China's competitive sports system and development path have their own characteristics and experiences, and there is no reason to completely deny them. However, active reforms should be carried out to eliminate evils. The development direction of sports is to combine popularization with improvement, or in other words, to coordinate the development of mass sports and competitive sports.

The meeting decided that the 7th National Games in 1993 will include 33 Olympic events and 15 non-Olympic events. Each province, municipality, and autonomous region can participate in up to 30 events. The National Winter Games will be canceled, but speed skating and short-track speed skating will be retained and included in the 7th National Games. Medals won by Chinese athletes in the Olympics will also be counted in the National Games results. Starting from 1991, the National City Games and the National Youth Games will be merged and held every four years.

　　全国体委主任会议在京结束    
    数项改革措施出台
    本报北京４月２０日讯  记者汪大昭报道：上任只有３个月的国家体委主任伍绍祖对今天下午在这里结束的全国体委主任会议相当满意。他认为，在体育界内外思想十分活跃的形势下，为期６天的会议不回避矛盾，纵横交错地讨论了许多人们关心的问题，交流了情况和想法，在不少问题上取得了一致的认识。
    伍绍祖将我国体育界的战略性口号概括为：广泛开展群众性体育活动，提高竞技运动水平。改善体育设施，加强教育和科研工作，努力向实现世界体育强国的目标迈进。
    人们议论纷纭的对我国体育现状和汉城奥运会上中国选手表现的评估，也在这次会议上得到了明确的回答。伍绍祖不赞成“兵败汉城”的说法。他认为中国运动员在汉城奥运会上取得的成绩与自身实力基本相符，有些项目发挥不理想，打了败仗，应当看作兵家常事和成功之母，要公正评价。事实上，中国女排和乒乓球队都在卧薪尝胆，争取再振雄风。我国竞技运动体制和发展道路有自己的特色和经验，没有理由全盘否定，但是应当积极改革，兴利除弊。体育运动的发展方针是普及与提高相结合，或者说是群众体育与竞技体育协调发展。
    会议决定，１９９３年第七届全运会将设３３个奥运会项目和１５个非奥运项目，各省市自治区报名参加的比赛以３０项为限。全国冬季运动会取消，保留速度滑冰和短跑道速滑两项比赛，列入第七届全运会的比赛项目，我国选手在奥运会取得的奖牌也将计入全运会成绩。从１９９１年起，将全国城市运动会与全国青少年运动会合并，每４年举行一次。
