The siheyuan, a meticulously designed and symmetrical residential form, has been passed down in Beijing, this ancient Eastern city, for over a thousand years. Today, it has become a thing of the past, marking the end of an era.

Dongdan, Tuanjie Lake, Wuluju, Xianghe Garden, Shuangyu Tree, Zuojiazhuang, Jingsong—one batch after another of new residential complexes covering dozens of hectares have risen, becoming the symbol of the new era of Beijing's housing. While these complexes have introduced many new elements in terms of style, it is undeniable that they often appear crowded and monotonous, far from fully expressing the individuality of our nation or reflecting the new aspirations of the people.

What will the layout of Beijing's housing be like tomorrow?

Beijing's residents are discussing it. Beijing's leaders are studying it.

After much deliberation, a consensus has emerged, albeit not a definitive conclusion:

Buildings today must withstand the test of tomorrow;
They must be quiet, comfortable, beautiful, and convenient...

The prestigious design institutes of Tsinghua University, the Ministry of Machinery, the Beijing Institute of Architecture, the Beijing Urban Planning and Design Institute, and the Beijing Urban Construction Development Research and Design Institute, along with a group of accomplished design experts, have absorbed the essence of China's traditional architecture and drawn on the experiences of contemporary foreign architecture to present numerous design schemes. The municipal leadership and the Municipal Construction Commission convened a panel of renowned design experts from across the country for a nine-day review. Thus, a large-scale new residential area with a construction area of 2.66 million square meters and a total investment of over 3 billion yuan was finalized, to be located in Fangzhuang.

This construction scale surpasses that of five Dongdan complexes.

This is a major battle in Beijing's housing construction.

Fangzhuang is located in the southeastern part of Beijing's urban area, between the South Third Ring Road and the South Second Ring Road. To the northeast, it borders Longtan Lake, and to the northwest, it is close to the Temple of Heaven Park. It is only 7 kilometers from Tiananmen Square, and there are no noisy factories around. It has become the ideal location for the new residential area. In the near future, a dazzling array of residential buildings with different styles and landscapes will rise here.

People love gardens. Fangzhuang is a large Chinese-style garden. Running east to west is a wide living street, equipped with various commercial facilities for convenient living. Running north to south is a quiet street, flanked by 30-meter-wide green belts, interspersed with variously shaped and colorful flower beds, rich and inviting. As soon as one enters, a sense of tranquility and delight fills the heart. High-rise and low-rise buildings are interspersed, with tower buildings and flat-roofed buildings combined, distributed as sparsely as possible among the gardens.

The residential area is divided into four large districts: Fanggu Garden, Fangcheng Garden, Fangqun Garden, and Fangxing Garden. Each district has its unique style. Fangcheng Garden, by Longtan Lake, is designed with the image of two dragons playing with a pearl. To express the new consciousness of the 1980s, the designers added many walkways and platforms between the buildings in Fangxing Garden, allowing people to walk between buildings without crossing the road.

Schools, hospitals, shops, and other public facilities are reasonably arranged here. To meet the needs of families with different economic conditions, the interior facilities and decorations of the buildings are divided into three grades: A, B, and C. The entire heating system is centralized outside the residential area, ensuring that the living area is free of dust and smoke. The Stars of the Ancient City will present a new era of Beijing's housing to the people.

Currently, the state is tightening its control over construction projects, but here, it has made an exception, clearly stating: the construction scale will not change; the deadline for basic completion by 1990 will not change.

Sixteen construction brigades, totaling 20,000 personnel, have been working tirelessly since September 16, 1986, for over 30 months, and have already taken shape. Mayors from across the country and foreign architectural experts who have visited the site have all praised: The Stars of the Ancient City are indeed the enchanting stars of old Beijing.

In fact, the newest and most beautiful stars here are the builders of the new residences. It is they who, through the vast stage of Fangzhuang, showcase to people at home and abroad the combination of our nation's ancient culture and today's advanced architectural art. They are the true enchanting stars, the stars of hope for our era!

The Iron Commander

In the construction industry, Li Ruihuan was once a star. During the construction of the Great Hall of the People, he served as the leader of the Youth Shock Brigade and was known as the living Lu Ban.

Zhang Baifa was also once a star. In the construction industry, he was a model worker.

Liu Baoling was also a star. During the construction of the Great Hall of the People, he served as the technical director, and later, he played important roles in the construction of the Chairman Mao Memorial Hall, Dongdan, and many new residential areas in Beijing. His work achievements are outstanding.

Today, he can lead his troops into Fangzhuang as the manager of the Beijing Municipal First Urban Construction and Development Company to undertake the development task of the Stars of the Ancient City, relying on his experience, courage, and pursuit.

Before liberation, he was just a poor worker in the construction industry. After the Five-Star Red Flag was raised over Tiananmen, he relied on his own intelligence and took on increasingly heavy responsibilities in the construction team, playing an increasingly important role in one major project after another. But he was still not satisfied. He did not want to be a leader. But he longed for the day when he could command tens of thousands of troops to build a beautiful group of buildings, providing Beijing with the best new residences of the time.

Everything came true. He received the orders from the Construction Commission and the Urban Construction and Development Corporation, leading his troops into Fangzhuang. His face, which was already stern, became even more solemn. He summoned his deputy managers Huang Guomin, Liu Chaogun, Wu Shengxin, Fu Guozhen, Yang Bin, the office director Jin Di, and several section chiefs:

"I am prepared to be scolded by you."

Silence.

"I plan to perform major surgery on the company's system. Surgery requires cutting, and it hurts." He announced the specific plan to adjust the organization, reduce the number of department personnel, clarify responsibilities, and eliminate internal friction.

The office was in chaos for several days. Supporters, opponents, pleaders, and scolders were all present. Deputy managers could not handle it and had to call him for another meeting.

"I said, I am prepared to be scolded. But the plan will not change. If there are any problems, I will take responsibility." The meeting adjourned.

He is truly an iron commander.

"Here, you have to be tough," he said to himself.

This is the truth. The Stars of the Ancient City project involves over a hundred enterprises and institutions and thousands of relocated residents. Those being relocated all hope to get more money and better housing from the state, the best orientation, the best floors... Their desires are endless, and they demand more and more. Throughout the project, not a single Lei Feng emerged during the relocation. Every relocated household, through relatives and friends, sent notes and made phone calls to the iron commander, surrounding him tightly with a dense network of personal connections.

"I'm sorry." He put all these notes, including some with significant influence, at the bottom of the drawer and ignored them, insisting on handling the relocation according to the state's regulations.

"You can't meet the requirements, so I won't move. What can you do about it!"

The iron commander decisively requested judicial support to forcibly relocate those who were unreasonable.

The obstacles were finally cleared, and the project quickly moved forward.

At this moment, he sat in front of Zhang Baifa without any hesitation: "I want authority." "Speak." "The original plan was to complete the project by 1992, but now it needs to be advanced by two years, which is too tight." "This is the decision of the municipal government." "To complete it on time, I request permission to conduct bidding for construction units nationwide."

The policy is too strong. Beijing's housing has always been built by Beijing's construction workers. Using a new approach, what if Beijing's construction units cannot find work?

The case was taken to the municipal government. Mayor Chen Xitong decisively replied to the Beijing Municipal Construction Commission: It is acceptable not to guarantee the jobs of backward units. If Beijing's construction units cannot find work, they can go to other places.

Based on the spirit of the reply, "One Development" immediately began selecting from the more than 60 construction companies that came to bid from across the country. As soon as the news spread, there was much discussion from top to bottom: "Why don't Beijing people sit in Beijing." Many people had already started saying unpleasant things.

Let them go, he thought. In every project he had participated in, which one did not have difficulties? Which one did not face criticism? But in the face of every difficulty, he had never given up. Chinese people, whether standing or sitting, must act like Chinese people. Even a few unpleasant words cannot be endured, still calling oneself a Chinese person. Wanting others to say nice things about you before the job is done, ten out of ten will fail. To be honest, as long as you complete the job, all the unpleasant words will disappear like smoke.

Construction brigades from inside and outside Beijing, who had successfully bid, marched into Fangzhuang in a grand manner, and a fierce competition without a referee began on the boiling Fangzhuang construction site. The iron commander finally relaxed the muscles on his face and showed a rare smile.

The Honest Ox

Originally, it should be called Handan No. 2, the abbreviation for the Second Construction Company of Handan City, Hebei Province. However, in Fangzhuang, people call Handan No. 2 the Honest Ox. The people of Handan No. 2 are indeed as honest as oxen.

In the 1980s, the old yellow ox seemed to have depreciated and was not popular, but Handan No. 2 still willingly became the ox on the construction site.

The Honest Ox, with 2,000 personnel, together with the 100,000-strong construction army from Tangshan, fought for the construction of New Tangshan for nine consecutive years, winning battle after battle. They received five national-level awards. Leaders such as Zhao Ziyang visited their construction sites. The People's Daily gave them two front-page headlines to promote their Honest Ox spirit. They successfully bid to enter Beijing, and their peers estimated that they would lead the way in demanding a high price per square meter, so they came to investigate: "How much do you plan to set the price per square meter?" Manager Huang Jinxing smiled honestly: "Doesn't the state have regulations?" "Regulations also have upper and lower limits." "Let the client decide." How honest! "So honest, can your company make a profit?"

The answer is a story.

Huang Jinxing decided the construction deployment in Beijing on April 29, 1987. He returned to Tangshan on the 30th and set out for Beijing with his troops and machinery on the night of May 1st. Preparation for construction, which usually takes several months, was compressed into 10 days. They started construction on May 11th. No need to explain further, their profits are not in the high prices they demand from the client, but in their speed and quality.

"Enterprises make smart money, save effort, but it's not safe; make honest money, it's reliable. We prefer to work a little harder and still strive for reliability." Huang Jinxing's words.

The Honest Ox, in Fangzhuang, indeed works hard.

Their first project was to complete six 30,000-square-meter, five-story residential buildings in seven and a half months. "The time is too tight." Huang Jinxing told Liu Baoling honestly, this speed was unprecedented for Handan No. 2 and rare in Beijing.

"This is for the relocated residents, if we don't complete it on time, it will delay the entire project's schedule." Liu Baoling's words.

"Let's do it." Huang Jinxing accepted the heavy burden of the task, showing his determination to fight hard and create a new record.

But what about the workers? Among them, a large number had never been to Beijing before. Huang Jinxing went to the construction site and asked: "When will you go to Tiananmen Square?" "After completing the first phase of the project." "When will you visit the Great Wall?" "After the relocated residents happily move into the new residence, we will happily visit the Great Wall."

Huang Jinxing turned his back and extended his hand to the workers:

"Thank you, thank you!" He was moved to tears by the workers.

During the intense construction period, they encountered the rare heatwave of 1987. Sweat falling on the rebar would immediately turn into white smoke, but the workers did not dare to sit down to catch their breath. When it rained heavily, their clothes were soaked, and when the sun came out, they were dried, but the workers still stood firmly on the construction site.

On such occasions, Huang Jinxing could not express what he felt in his heart. If their wives and parents saw them, they would surely be heartbroken and pull them away. Huang Jinxing also wanted to reach out and pull them, but he did not want to. In fact, he could not pull them down. They were treating this hardship as joy, they wanted to forge the Honest Ox spirit of their company, and the indomitable will, into the thousand-year-old cause of Beijing.

Seven and a half months later, the initial wasteland finally stood six five-story new buildings, and after inspection, the quality was excellent. At this time, Zhang Baifa requested the Construction Commission to convene a meeting of the leaders of Beijing's construction units here. Liu Baoling, on behalf of the client, commended the Honest Ox spirit of Handan No. 2, Huang Jinxing, on behalf of the contractor, expressed gratitude to all parties, and Zhang Baifa, on behalf of the municipal leaders, delivered a congratulatory speech.

Zhang Baifa first seized the opportunity to sow the seeds of the Honest Ox spirit in Beijing.

The Honest Ox worked diligently, never slacking off. In 1988, they accepted the task of building a 30,000-square-meter, 25-story tower. The best construction method for such a building is slipforming, but they had never done it before. Facing new difficulties, Huang Jinxing decided without hesitation: send technical personnel to learn from advanced units in other cities, and seek guidance from the Inner Mongolia First Construction Company, which had excellent slipforming technology in Fangzhuang. The Honest Ox, like a sponge, absorbed experiences from far and near, digested them, and turned them into their own precious blood. After a hard fight, they finally broke through the difficulty and completed the main structure in just three months. The magnificent building became another highlight of the Honest Ox spirit.

The "Rural Emperor" of the Peasant Construction Team

This is a team of peasants from the foothills of Langya Mountain in Yi County, Hebei Province, with 800 people, none of whom eat commercial grain. Before entering Beijing, their leader announced: "All men, no women allowed." "Are you afraid that women's physical strength is not up to the task?" "I want my 800 brothers to focus their energy." "It's too monotonous." "If you find it monotonous, you can hug your wife all day at home."

What leader, he is simply a "rural emperor."

This construction team's "emperor" was not appointed by superiors but was fought for and supported by the people. He himself said: "To reach this position, without some ability, no matter who appoints you, you won't be able to stand."

His surname is Wang, and his full name is Xuewen. He is 40 years old.

In 1977, inspired by Li Ruihuan's book "Simple Calculation Methods for Woodwork," he also wrote a manuscript "Calculation of Spiral Staircases," and went to Beijing three times to seek Li Ruihuan's guidance. Because Li Ruihuan was on an overseas visit and later became the mayor of Tianjin, he did not find him, and although the book was not published, his talent was not buried. In 1980, he led a dozen peasants to build flat-roofed houses in Shanxi and then to build high-rise buildings. The team quickly expanded to several hundred people. He became the "emperor" of this peasant army. Due to his strict requirements, the construction quality surpassed many professional teams, and in 1986, he finally won the bid in Beijing. He led his troops into Beijing City in a grand manner.

The people have entered Beijing, but apart from the strength given by their parents and the skills they have fought for, they have nothing else. They are not like state-owned enterprises, where if they lose money, they can still receive wages and enjoy free medical care. If they lose money, they will have no way out. If they fall ill, they will not be able to support their wives, and their wives will have to take care of them.

Why only one gender is allowed is already clear. Here, they need to cherish their energy more than any other unit and cherish their reputation in the capital.

The building they accepted is unique in shape and structure. The 16 floors above ground are connected by a long corridor every two floors, practical, quiet, and beautiful, but the construction is much more difficult than ordinary flat-roofed buildings. Facing the thick stack of drawings, Wang Xuewen and his peasant brothers did not show a smile for several days. They were studying and deploying the best construction plan.

The news spread, and the relevant departments of Beijing Municipality decided to examine their foremen, issuing certificates to those who passed. "Those who can pass should go." The "rural emperor" slammed the table, "Whoever passes the exam, I will reward them."

The spacious classroom, a desk every 1.5 meters, several examiners simultaneously examining, the atmosphere was even tenser than university entrance exams.

Structural mechanics, drawing interpretation, machinery, materials, construction measurement, construction technology, safety management, water, electricity, budgeting... 13 subjects, examined until people's heads were spinning.

Strong hands holding fine pens, writing stroke by stroke, every stroke and every dot are related to the fate of this peasant team. Fortunately, their learning did not start today. Many people, from the moment they stepped onto the construction site, treated knowledge and technology as their second life, and everyone studied more seriously than primary school students. A few seeds sown, a few harvests reaped. The exam results, eight teams of Jingyi Company, only obtained 14 qualified certificates in total, as the eighth team, they snatched 6 certificates at once, Wang Xuewen and his deputy team leader Wang Xueliang also obtained the title of regional peasant engineer. "Who says peasants have no knowledge, look!" Wang Xuewen wanted to hold up the people who obtained the certificates and throw them into the air. In his eyes, the foremen who obtained the certificates are the top scholars of the construction team.

Wang Xuewen and his brothers, relying on their diligence in learning, the help of experienced workers on the construction site, and the support of the Beijing Municipal Construction Commission and the Beijing Municipal First Urban Construction and Development Company, completed three years' work in two and a half years, building 54,294 square meters of housing. The 16-story new building they built is exquisite in craftsmanship and excellent in quality, already a rare masterpiece, praised by all experts who came to visit, and the television station has introduced it to the audience several times.

Today, they are also stars. Whether it is today or tomorrow, they can proudly tell their relatives, this generation and the next, that in the scroll of the Stars of the Ancient City, there is our peasants' brilliant stroke!

The Green Team

It seems that a director had made careful arrangements, in Fangzhuang, in addition to workers and peasants, a green team also marched in, a group of soldiers who had just taken off their military uniforms.

No matter how they introduce themselves to the outside world as workers of the Beijing Municipal Urban Construction First Company, no matter how Yu Zhitan prints the eye-catching "Manager of Urban Construction First Company" on his name card, people can immediately recognize this team as former engineering troops by looking at their steps towards the construction site and listening to their labor chants.

Their actions are too orderly, and their energy is too vigorous.

The flame of youth on their bodies is mostly ignited by the magical wind from Yu Zhitan. It is said that whoever is with him can obtain an upward momentum.

Yu Zhitan joined the army from a local school in 1961, rising step by step from a soldier to the deputy commander of the Engineering Corps. Just as he wanted to do a few significant things, the state issued an order: a million troops to be demobilized! Overnight, he went from a soldier to a civilian. The organization arranged for him to take the position of deputy manager of the Urban Construction Corporation, but he felt this position was too comfortable and repeatedly requested: "Transfer me to the front line!"

Coming to the Urban Construction First Company, taking on today's role, it is like a fish returning to the sea, with a great opportunity to struggle with the winds and waves.

"Our first battle, we must win!" As soon as he stepped into Fangzhuang, he decided to use the image of the Engineering Corps, forged by the army, to overcome all difficulties, and to cast the orderly beauty of the army, which has become a habit, into the Stars of the Ancient City.

Their task ahead is to build a 7-li drainage ditch. In the few months before May 15, 1988, they had completed 20% of the entire project. The remaining 80% must be completed by June 15. If the time is delayed and the rainy season begins, encountering heavy rain, it will flood the 147-hectare construction site, and the loss will be incalculable.

Facing such a tough battle, Yu Zhitan brought his luggage and lived on the construction site. He brought a reform plan. He wanted to link everyone's labor with economic benefits, not only to eliminate the company's big pot of food but also to eliminate the big pot of food for the work teams. No matter who it is, as long as they can lay one more brick, they can get one more point. He also brought a propaganda car, he wanted to carry out on-site propaganda and mobilization, making the political atmosphere on the construction site thick.

Someone said, in the army, this can be done, but now they have taken off their uniforms, should they still do this? He said, changing uniforms does not change the soul, as long as I am in charge, wherever I go, I will also grasp ideological and political work. He also made a regulation: office staff, on Sundays, as long as they are physically able, all go to work, and as long as they really work hard, all will be paid according to their labor.

Material and spiritual, two weapons, double-pronged attack, he wanted to inject a combustible agent into every cell of the workers.

The ditch passes through farmland and encounters rain and sand. The project entered the most difficult stage, and after a day's work, people were already exhausted. But there was not much time left.

"The critical moment has arrived!" Yu Zhitan told his workers the true situation in one sentence.

Silence. But there was sound. Everyone's hearts were asking: what to do?

"Follow me!" This is military language. Yu Zhitan, wearing high boots, jumped into the muddy ground. "Charge!" Again, military language. But no one shouted it out. The workers all shouted with their actions.

In the vast darkness, rows of lights were pulled up, the construction site became a battlefield, no, an examination ground. Examining the workers, examining Yu Zhitan, examining Yu Zhitan's reform plan and that propaganda car, examining the entire green team.

No change, still like wearing green military uniforms. But also changed, no need for green restraints, no need for green calls, the hoarse voice, shouting out, is already the strongest voice of our nation.

The drainage ditch was completed on June 13, two days ahead of schedule.

Such things, such moving songs, on the construction site are really too many, too many. The romantic people of Beijing, especially the more than 70,000 people who will have the fortune to move into the new residence, when they set a banquet for their moving-in celebration, they will surely look up and count the beautiful stars that have risen in Fangzhuang, and for the people who have shed sweat here, created miracles here, they will surely raise a cup, and then another cup!

　　古城群星    
    （报告文学）
    李琦　凯法
    四合院，精巧、对称的住宅形式，在北京这个东方古老的城市，流传上千年之后，到了今天已成为历史，划上了句号。
    前三门、团结湖、五路居、香河园、双榆树、左家庄、劲松，一批批占地几十公顷的新型建筑群，相继矗立起来，成为古城住宅的新时期的象征，它们在风格上有了许多新意，但无庸讳言，这些建筑群体又显得过于拥挤，过于单调，远远没能表达我们这个民族的个性，没能充分反映人们新的追求。
    明天，首都住宅该有什么样的新格局呢？
    北京的市民在议论。北京的领导在研究。
    上上下下，经过反反复复的酝酿，终于形成了一个不是结论的结论：
    能叫今天的建筑，经得起明天的检验；
    要安静、舒适、美观、方便……
    清华大学建筑设计院、机械部设计研究总院、北京建筑设计院、北京城建设计院、北京城建开发科研设计所，一个个赫赫有名的设计单位，一批批有成就的设计专家，吸收我国传统建筑之精粹，借鉴当今国外建筑的经验，拿出了许多设计方案。市领导和市建委，又召集全国知名设计权威，进行了长达９天的论证。一个定点于方庄，建筑面积２６６万平方米，总投资达３０多亿元的大型新住宅区的建设规划就这样敲定了。
    这个建筑规模，超过了５个前三门。
    这是北京住宅建设上的一个大战役。
    方庄，地处北京城区东南，介于南三环路南二环路之间，东北依着龙潭湖，西北靠近天坛公园，到天安门仅７公里，四周没有喧闹的工厂，它，成了新住宅区的最佳地址。用不了多长时间，这里将升起一片具有不同风格、不同景观的住宅楼的灿烂群星。
    人们都喜爱花园。方庄住宅区就是一个中国式的大花园。横贯东西，是宽阔的生活街，这里有为人们生活提供种种方便的商业设施。贯穿南北的为静街，街道两旁，是３０多米宽的绿化林带，其间还有形状各异、花色品种繁多，富有诱惑力的各种大花坛。它让人们一进这里，就能感到心旷神怡。高层多层相间，塔楼板楼结合，分布尽可能稀疏的楼群，建于花园之中。
    住宅区分成４个大区：芳古园、芳城园、芳群园、芳星园。每个大区，都有各自的独特风格。龙潭湖畔的芳城园，投影为双龙戏珠。为了表现８０年代的新意识，设计者又在芳星园楼群之间添了许多走廊和平台，人们可以在楼与楼之间穿行，无需横穿马路。
    这里学校、医院、商店和其他各种公共设施安排合理。为了满足不同经济状况的家庭的需要，楼内的设施和装潢，分出甲、乙、丙三等，整个供热设备，集中到住宅区以外，在生活区内，不仅无土，而且无烟。古城群星，将向人们展现一个首都住宅的新世纪。
    目前，国家对基建工程一压再压，却在这里高抬贵手，明确宣布：建筑规模不变；１９９０年基本完工的时限不变。
    １６支建筑大军，２万人马，从１９８６年９月１６日破土动工，经过了３０多个月的奋战，已把古城群星雕出了一个雏形。来自全国的２４名市长和来自国外的一批批建筑专家，参观之后都称赞：古城群星，确实是古老北京的迷人之星。
    其实，在这里，最新最美的星还是新住宅的建设者。是他们，通过方庄这个广阔的舞台，向国内外的人们展示我们这个民族的古老文化，和当今高超的建筑艺术的结合。他们才是真正的迷人之星，我们时代的希望之星！
    铁“司令”
    在建筑业上，李瑞环曾是明星，当年建设人民大会堂，他当青年突击队长，号称活鲁班。
    张百发也曾是明星，当年，在建筑行业里，他是劳模。
    他，刘宝岭也是明星。当年，建设人民大会堂，他是技术主任，以后建设毛主席纪念堂和前三门，还有北京的许多新住宅，他都在其中担任过重要角色，工作成绩显著。
    今天，他能以北京市第一城市建设开发公司经理的身份，率军开进方庄，承担古城群星的开发任务，靠的是他的经验、勇气和追求。
    解放前，他不过是一个建筑行业中的穷工人，共和国的五星红旗在天安门升起之后，他凭着自己的聪明才智，在建筑队伍中挑起越来越重的担子，在一项项大工程中起着越来越重要的作用，但他还是不满足。他不想当什么长。但他盼望有一天自己能指挥万千人马，盖一片漂亮的大楼，为人民提供当今北京第一流的新住宅。
    一切都如愿了。他奉建委和城市建设开发总公司之命，带着他的人马，开进方庄，他那张本来就很少有笑容的脸，显得更严肃了。他把副经理黄国民、刘朝群、邬圣鑫、付国珍、杨斌，办公室主任金悌和几位科长召集起来：
    “我准备挨你们一次骂。”
    无声。
    “我要在公司的体制上动个大手术。做手术就得动刀，就得挨疼。”他宣布了调整机构，减少科室人员，明确职责、消除内耗的具体方案。
    大吵几天。办公室像开了的锅。支持者、反对者、求情者、叫骂者均有之。副经理招架不住，只得又找他开会。
    “说了，我准备挨骂。但方案不改。出了问题我负责。”散会。
    真是个铁“司令”。
    “在这里，你不硬不行。”他自己说。
    这是真话。古城群星工程，有上百家企事业单位和数千家居民搬迁。是拆迁的，都希望向国家多要一点钱，多要一点房，要最好的朝向，最佳的层次……欲望无穷尽，得寸进尺，整个工程里，拆迁中没涌现出半个雷锋。一家家拆迁户，通过亲戚朋友，给铁“司令”递条子，打电话，密密麻麻的“人情网”，把他围得紧紧的。
    “对不起。”他把这些条子，包括一些来头很大的条子统统压在抽屉底下不理睬，坚持照国家规定的拆迁法办事。
    “我达不到要求就不搬，你能怎么着！”
    铁“司令”，果断地请司法机关支援，对不讲理的采取依法强制拆迁。
    障碍终于扫清了，工程迅速向前推进。
    这会儿，他坐在张百发面前，也没有半点拘谨：“我要权。”“说。”“工程原计划是１９９２年完工，现在要提前两年，太紧了。”“这是市政府定的。”“要如期完成，我请求允许我们在全国范围内对施工单位进行招标。”
    政策性太强了，北京市的房，历来是北京的建筑工人干，采用新招，北京的建筑单位落榜吃不上饭怎么办？
    官司直打到市政府。陈希同市长果断批复北京市建委：可以不包落后单位的饭碗，北京的建筑单位没有饭吃，可以到外地去找。
    根据批复精神，“一开发”开始就在全国前来投标的６０多家建筑公司中选择。消息刚刚传开，上上下下就议论纷纷：“北京人为什么屁股不坐在北京。”不少人已经说起了难听的脏话。
    说去吧，他过去参加的一项项工程，哪项没有困难，哪项没叫人说，但他在哪个困难面前服过输？中国人，站着、坐着，都得像个中国人，连几句难听的话都顶不住，还叫中国人。事没成就想叫人家给你说好听的，十个有十个要垮台。老实说，只要你把事干成了，什么难听的话也都烟消云散了。
    北京内外，投标中榜的各路建筑大军，雄赳赳开进方庄，在沸腾的方庄工地，展开了没有裁判的大竞赛。铁“司令”这才牵动他脸上绷紧的肌肉，露出一丝难得的微笑。
    憨牛子
    本来，该叫邯二，河北省邯郸市第二建筑公司的简称嘛。可是在方庄，人们称邯二为憨牛子。邯二的人们确实都憨厚得像牛。
    八十年代，老黄牛像是贬值了，不吃香了，可是邯二自己依然心甘情愿地当工地上的牛。
    憨牛子，２０００人马，和唐山１０万建设大军一起，为建设新唐山，足足拚搏了９年，胜仗接连不断，先后获得５次国家级奖励。赵紫阳等领导人，都先后到他们的工地视察过。人民日报先后拿出两个头版头条的位置，宣扬了他们的憨牛子精神。他们中榜进京，同行们估计他们在造价上会带头要个好价钱，就前来摸底：“你们一平方米的造价打算定多少？”经理黄金祥憨厚地一笑：“国家不是有规定吗？”“规定也有上下的浮动数呀！”“叫甲方定吧。”真憨呵！“这么憨，你们公司能有效益吗？”
    回答是告诉你一段经历。
    黄金祥在北京决定施工部署的时间是１９８７年４月２９日，他３０日返回唐山，５月１日晚上，就连人马带机械夜行军奔赴北京。开工准备，人家需几个月，他们压缩到１０天，５月１１日，就破土动工。不用再解释了，他们的效益，不是在向甲方要的高价里，而是从自己的速度和质量中去获得。
    “企业，挣聪明钱，省力，但不保险；挣憨钱，牢靠。我们宁可多出点力，也还是要求个牢靠。”黄金祥的话。
    憨牛子，在方庄，确实是舍得卖力气呵。
    他们的第一项工程是７个半月拿下６幢３万平方米的５层住宅楼。“时间太紧了”。黄金祥对刘宝岭说的是真话，这速度，邯二自己以前没有过，北京市至今也属少见。
    “这是给拆迁户用的，不及时把它们拿下来，会贻误整个工程的工期。”刘宝岭的话。
    “干。”黄金祥接下了山那么重的困难，亮出了准备硬打硬拚创个新纪录的决心。
    可工人怎样呢？他们当中，有一大批是头一次进京的。黄金祥到工地问：“你们什么时候上天安门？”“拿下第一期工程再去。”“什么时候逛长城？”“等拆迁户高高兴兴搬进新居，我们再痛痛快快上长城。”
    黄金祥背过脸，向工人伸出了手：
    “谢谢，谢谢！”他被工人感动得落泪了。
    进入紧张施工期，正遇１９８７年少有的酷暑，汗水落到钢筋上都会冒起白烟，可工人舍不得坐下来喘口气。遇上大雨，衣服被浇透，太阳出来，又被烤干，可工人还是一直坚守在工地上。
    每在这种场合，黄金祥说不出心里是什么滋味。如果是被工人的妻子父母看到，一定会心疼得上前把他们拉下来。黄金祥也想向前伸手，但又不愿拉。其实，也拉不下。他们正把这种苦当成快乐，他们要把自己公司的憨牛子精神，把坚毅不拔的意志，铸进北京的千秋大业里。
    ７个半月后，当初的那片杂草地，终于耸立起６幢５层的新楼，经过检验，质量优良。就在这时，张百发要求建委，召集北京建筑单位的领导，在这里开起了现场会。刘宝岭代表甲方表彰邯二的憨牛子精神，黄金祥代表乙方，向各方致谢，张百发代表市领导讲话祝贺。
    张百发先抓住了邯二这颗肥硕的种子，要在北京播种憨牛子精神的春天。
    憨牛子勤奋耕耘，从不松套。１９８８年，他们接受了建造一幢３万多平方米的２５层塔楼的任务，对这种楼的最佳施工方案是滑模，可这种工艺以前他们从来未干过。面对新的困难，黄金祥毫不犹豫地决定：派技术人员到其他城市的先进单位去取经，向正在方庄施工的滑模技术过得硬的内蒙古第一建筑公司请教。憨牛子，像海绵一样，把远远近近的经验经过消化，变成自己宝贵的血液，经过一番苦战，终于胜利突破难关，仅仅三个月，就拿下了主体工程，雄伟壮观的建筑，成了憨牛子精神的又一个亮点。
    农民建筑队的“土皇帝”
    这是一支农民的队伍，从河北省易县狼牙山脚下来，８００人，没有一个吃商品粮的。进京之前，他们的首领宣布：“统统去男的，不准有一个女人。”“怕女人体力不佳顶不下来吗？”
    “我要叫８００名弟兄精力集中。”“太枯燥了。”“嫌枯燥，可以成天在家抱媳妇。”
    什么首领，简直是“土皇帝”。
    这位建筑队的“皇帝”。不是上级封的，而是自己奋斗出来的，群众拥戴的。他自己就说：“到我这位置上来，没有点本事，甭管是谁封，都站不住脚。”
    他姓王，大号叫学文。现年４０。
    １９７７年，他受李瑞环的《木工简易计算法》一书的启发，也写了一本稿子《螺旋楼梯计算》，先后三次进京要找李瑞环指教。因为李瑞环出国访问，后来又到天津市当市长，他没能找着，书虽未出成，才华还是没被埋没。１９８０年，他带领十几个农民，到山西盖平房到造大楼，队伍一下子发展到几百人。他成了这支农民军的“皇帝”。由于他严格要求，建筑质量赛过许多专业队，１９８６年终于在北京中标。他率军威风凛凛进了北京城。
    人进京来了，可他们除了爹妈给他们的那点力气，和自己奋斗出来的手艺，就什么也没有了。他们不像全民所有制的公司，赔了还可以有工资照发，还可以享受公费医疗。他们一旦赔了，就会上天无路，入地无门。一旦病倒了，养不了老婆，还得叫老婆侍候。
    为什么只能要一个性别，已经无需解释，在这里，他们比任何单位都更需珍惜自己的精力，珍惜自己在首都的声誉。
    他们接受的一幢楼，造型别致，结构独特，地面上的１６层，每２层有一个长条走廊连结，实用方便，安静美观，可施工就比普通板楼困难得多，面对厚厚的图纸，王学文和他的农民兄弟，好几天没有露一丝笑容。他们在研究，在部署最佳施工方案。
    消息传来，北京市有关部门，要对他们的工长进行考试，及格者发给上岗证书。“能考的都去。”“土皇帝”一拍桌子，“谁考得好我奖谁。”
    宽敞的大教室，隔１．５米一张桌子，几名监考员同时监考，气氛比大学招生还紧张。
    结构力学、识图、机械、材料、施工测量、施工技术、安全管理、水、电、预算……１３门课程，考得人们头昏脑胀。
    粗壮的手，握着细细的笔，一笔一划地书写着，每一笔每一划，都关连着这支农民队伍的命运。好在他们的学习并非今日开始，许多人从一踏上工地那天起，就把知识和技术看成自己的第二生命，个个学得比小学生上学还认真。几分播种，就有几分收获。考试结果，京易公司的八个队，一共只获得１４张合格证书，作为第八队的一个队，就一下子夺得了６张，王学文和他的副队长王学良，还获得了地区农民工程师职称。“谁说农民没有知识，看看吧！”王学文恨不得把获得证书的人都举到手里，抛到空中。在他的眼里，获得证书的工长，就是建筑队伍中的状元郎。
    王学文和他的弟兄们，靠自己的勤奋治学，靠工地富有经验的工人老大哥帮助，靠北京市建委和北京市第一城市建筑开发公司的支持，他们在两年半的时间里，完成了３年的工作量，建成住宅５４２９４平方米，他们盖得那幢１６层新楼，工艺精细，质量优良，已经成了一幅难得的佳作，博得了所有前来参观的专家的好评，电视台曾多次向观众作了介绍。
    今天，他们也是明星了，不管是今天还是明天，他们已经可以理直气壮地向他们的亲人，这一代的，下一代的说，古城群星的画卷里，有我们农民的精采的一笔！
    绿色的队伍
    好像是有导演作过精心安排，方庄，除了工人、农民，还开进来一支绿色的队伍，一批刚刚脱去军装的兵。
    不管他们对外怎么说自己是北京市城建一公司的工人，不管郁志桐在给别人的名片上印着醒目的“城建一公司经理”的字样，但人们一看他们走向工地的脚步，一听他们呼出来的劳动号子，马上可以认出这支队伍原先当过工程兵。
    他们的行动太整齐了，精力太旺盛了。
    他们身上那股青春的火焰一大部分是郁志桐身上那股神奇的风吹起来的。都说谁跟他在一起，就可以得到一种向上的推力。
    郁志桐１９６１年从地方学校入伍，由战士一个台阶一个台阶升到了工程兵的副团长，正当他想干几件像样的大事的时候，国家下了一道命令：百万大裁军！一夜之间，他由军人变成了老百姓。组织上给他安排到城市建设总公司经理助理的岗位上，他自己觉得这个位置太安逸，就一次又一次要求：“把我调到第一线去！”
    来到城建一公司，担任今天的角色，像鱼回到了大海，有了和风浪搏击的大好机会。
    “第一仗，我们必须打赢！”一踏进方庄，他就决心要用军队给他们塑造起来的勇往直前的形象，用在部属中深深蕴藏着的力量和勇气，去制服一切困难，把已经成为习惯的军队的整齐划一美，铸进古城群星。
    他们面前的任务是修建一条７华里排水方沟，１９８８年５月１５日前的几个月，已拿下整个工程的２０％，其余的８０％，必须在６月１５日前攻下来，一旦贻误了时间，进入汛期，遇上大雨，淹掉１４７公顷的工地，损失不可估计。
    面对这样的硬仗，郁志桐带着行李亲自住到工地来了。他带来了一个改革方案。他要叫每个人的劳动都和经济效益挂起钩来，不仅要打掉公司的大锅饭，而且还要端掉班组的大锅饭，不管是谁，只要能多砌一块砖，就能多得一分利。他还带来一辆宣传车，他要开展现场宣传鼓动，把工地的政治空气搞得浓浓的。有人说，在部队，这么搞可以，现在都脱军装了，还搞这个吗？他说，换装不能换魂，只要叫我抓，走到哪，我也要抓思想政治工作。他又作了一条规定：机关人员，星期天，只要身体行的，统统下去劳动，只要是扑下身子真干的，统统按劳付酬。
    物质的，精神的，两套武器，双管齐下，他要给工人的每个细胞都注入能燃烧的动力剂。
    方沟穿过农田，又遇上阴雨、流沙。工程进入了最困难的阶段，一天干下来，人们已经精疲力尽。可偏偏时间剩下不多了。
    “关键的时候到了！”郁志桐把真实的情况用一句话，告诉自己的工人。
    无声。其实有声。大家的心里在问：怎么办？
    “跟我来！”这是军语，郁志桐脚穿高筒雨靴，跳进了泥泞地里。“冲啊！”又是军语。但都没喊出来。工人们都是用行动呼喊的。
    茫茫黑夜，拉起了一排排灯，工地成了战场，不，是考场。考工人，考郁志桐，考郁志桐的改革方案和那辆宣传车，考整个绿色的队伍。
    没有变，还像穿着绿色的军装。还是变了，无需绿色约束，无需绿色召唤，沙哑的嗓子，呼吼出来的，已经是我们这个民族的最强音。
    排水沟在６月１３日通水。比计划提前两天。
    这样的事，这样动听的歌，在工地实在太多，太多。多情的北京人民，特别是将来有幸搬入新居的２万多户的７万多人，在他们为乔迁之喜设宴的时候，一定会抬头数一数，在方庄升起来的一颗颗美丽的星，一定会为在这里洒下汗水的人们，创造奇迹的人们，干一杯，再干一杯！
