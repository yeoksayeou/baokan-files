Doudou is a second-grade student. This 8-year-old boy has to take the bus to school every day. Because of his painful experiences, he particularly likes watching the TV show "Don't Crowd!"

Does he have population awareness?

"Exactly, China has too many people, we need family planning. My grandmother is always busy with it, but it's so hard!"

Doudou's grandmother is Peng Peiyun, the director of the State Family Planning Commission. The day before yesterday afternoon, in Peng Peiyun's 12-square-meter office, she spoke to me in detail.

"As one of the seven major issues of greatest concern to the entire nation, controlling the population has been included in the resolution of the National People's Congress this time. Various levels of party and government leaders are increasingly recognizing that this major task cannot rely solely on the Family Planning Commission; it is time for the top party and government leaders to take a firm grip on it. The State Council has made regulations that from now on, the main population figures of each province will be published annually. During the NPC session, Henan Province Governor Cheng Weigao specially took four days off to return to Zhengzhou to sign a population target management responsibility book. Now, the majority of provincial, municipal, and autonomous region leaders across the country have taken action. I think that once the public's population awareness is raised, our working environment will improve."

This person in charge of "family planning," who works more than 10 hours a day and rarely rests on Sundays, indeed has a difficult job. She said: "The population situation we face is indeed very severe, but I do not agree with using terms like 'explosion' or 'crisis' to describe it. We should neither be blindly optimistic nor pessimistic about the population situation. In fact, since the early 1970s when we started implementing family planning, China has reduced its population by approximately 200 million. This remarkable achievement is the result of the concerted efforts of the entire Party, the nation, and the people. After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, we have had a clear and firm guiding ideology on the population issue and have accumulated relatively rich experience. We should be able to and can do a good job in family planning. As a professional family planning management worker, I hope that more people will strengthen their confidence and voluntarily practice family planning, which will make it possible to achieve the population target by the end of this century."

"With only a few years left until the end of this century, is it better to take some 'decisive' measures?" the reporter asked.

"The current family planning policy is formulated by the central government and must be strictly implemented. It should neither be relaxed nor tightened further. I firmly believe that as long as this policy is implemented steadily, the trend of rapid population growth in China can be controlled. The key now is that the policy has not been fully implemented. The focus and difficulty of China's family planning work are mainly in rural areas. Only by fully understanding the special conditions of China's rural areas at this stage and dedicating oneself to this cause with a strong sense of mission can the policy be effectively implemented. It is not feasible to seek quick results or simplify the process."

"What do you think is the most important work to control the rural population at present?" the reporter asked.

"First, propaganda and education should reach every village and household. In recent years, in the vast majority of urban areas, this propaganda has been able to reach every household, but in remote and impoverished areas, people do not hear any enlightening propaganda and education. Those who are having one child after another do not know how to raise a healthy and intelligent child. This has led to a vicious cycle of the more ignorant the more they give birth, the more they give birth the poorer they become.

"Second, there should be a series of supporting policies. For example, family planning should be included as a component of poverty alleviation, deployed simultaneously with other projects, inspected, evaluated, and completed in the same way. In this way, while achieving poverty alleviation, the goal of controlling the population can be achieved simultaneously."

"These tasks are more difficult to accomplish the lower you go in the hierarchy, aren't they?" the reporter knew that Peng Peiyun had traveled tens of thousands of miles in less than a year to understand the situation on the ground.

"Yes. Just imagine, from the moment a baby is born, each woman's subsequent contraception and family planning need to be cared for for 20 to 30 years! Currently, there are about 160,000 full-time family planning workers nationwide. Although the work is difficult, they can still endure hardship and work diligently and responsibly. In comparison, our government departments have not done enough to care for their lives, improve policy and technical levels. Especially since their work is often misunderstood, individuals often have to pay a high price, and society as a whole lacks understanding."

Family planning also involves very detailed technical work that needs to be implemented. Peng Peiyun said: "In fact, the more than 20 contraceptive and family planning methods currently used in our country are very effective. As long as they are used correctly, they can achieve the goal of family planning. Especially male sterilization technology, which is recognized as world-leading, the problem is that it is not promoted enough."

When saying goodbye, Peng Peiyun smiled and told me that the legislative work is proceeding at a faster pace, and the "Family Planning Regulations" are expected to be issued by the end of this year.

　　愿民众都自觉实行计划生育
　　——访国家计生委主任彭珮云
    本报记者　艾笑
    豆豆是２年级学生。这位８岁的小男孩每天上学必得挤公共汽车，因为他有痛苦“搏斗”的经历，特别爱看电视片《别挤了！》
    他也有人口意识？
    “就是嘛，中国人口太多，要计划生育。我奶奶整天在搞，可难了！”
    豆豆的奶奶是国家计生委主任彭珮云。前天下午，在彭珮云那间１２平方米的办公室里，我听她娓娓道来。
    “作为全国人民最关切的７大问题之一，控制人口这次已由全国人大会议写进决议了。各级党政领导也越来越认识到这件大事不能都依赖计生委，已到了党政一把手非大抓狠抓不可的时候了。国务院已做出规定，今后每年要公布各省主要人口数字。河南省省长程维高在人代会议期间还专门请了４天假回郑州签订人口目标管理责任书。现在全国多数省、市、自治区的主要领导都动起来了。我想，全民的人口意识一旦有所提高，我们的工作环境就会好转。”
    这位每日工作１０多个小时，周日都绝少休息的专管“计划生育”的第一把手，工作的确不易。她说：“我们面临的人口形势确实很严峻，可我不赞成用‘大爆炸’、‘大危机’等词来形容。对人口形势我们既不能盲目乐观，也不必悲观失望。事实上从７０年代初我们抓计划生育到现在，中国少生了大约２亿人。这一举世瞩目的成就，是我们全党、全国、全民齐心协力的结果，党的十一届三中全会以后，我们在人口问题上，已经有了明确而坚定的指导思想，积累了比较丰富的经验。我们应该，也可能把计划生育工作做好。作为一个计划生育管理专业工作者，我愿更多民众增强信心，自觉实行计划生育，这才有可能在本世纪末实现人口目标。”
    “到本世纪末已经没几年了，是不是采取些‘斩钉截铁’的措施好些？”记者问。
    “现行的计划生育政策是中央制定的，必须严格执行，既不能放宽，也不宜再收紧。我坚信只要稳定地执行这一政策，中国人口增长过快的势头是可以控制的。现在问题的关键是政策没能落实，中国的计划生育工作的重点和难点主要在农村，只有充分理解中国现阶段农村的特殊条件，怀着强烈的使命感献身这项事业，才能有效地落实政策。急于求成和简单化是不成的。”
    “您看当前控制农村人口最需要做的工作是什么？”
    “一是宣传教育要进村入户。这些年，在绝大部分城镇，这一宣传能做到家喻户晓，而穷乡僻壤，则听不到能使脑筋开窍的宣传教育，那些正在一个接一个生孩子的农民，不知道应当怎样生养一个健康聪明的孩子。出现了愈愚愈生、愈生愈穷的恶性循环。
    “二是应有一系列的配套政策。例如，计划生育应当作为扶贫的一项内容，与其它项目同时部署、同样检查、同样评比、同样完成。这样，脱贫的同时，可以同步达到控制人口的目的。”
    “这些工作，愈到基层愈难做吧？”记者知道，彭珮云用不到一年的功夫，南北东西行程几万里地，去了解下面的实情。
    “是啊。试想一下，自一个婴儿呱呱落地之后，对每个妇女身后的避孕节育，要负责关注二三十年哪！现在全国约有计划生育专职干部１６万左右，尽管工作难度大，他们仍能吃苦耐劳、认真负责地干下去。相比之下，我们政府部门对他们生活的关心、政策水平和技术水平的提高，做得却很不够。特别是由于他们的工作常常遭到误解，个人往往要付出很大代价，全社会还缺乏理解。”
    计划生育还有很细致的技术工作需要落实，彭珮云说：“其实，我国目前常用的２０多种避孕节育方法都是很有效的。只要正确使用，都能达到计划生育目的，尤其男性节育技术，被公认是世界领先的，问题是现在推广得很不够。”
    告别的时候，彭珮云笑眯眯地告诉我，立法工作正加快步伐进行，《计划生育条例》今年年底以前可望出台。
