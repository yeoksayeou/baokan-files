	Li Zhao Comrade:

	It is with great sorrow that I learned of Comrade Hu Yaobang's passing. I am deeply grieved. I am already old and infirm, and often place my hopes on the younger generations. Now that Comrade Hu Yaobang has passed away, I am truly saddened. Upon learning of his illness, I was very worried. I knew the severity of heart disease, so I frequently contacted Comrade Yang Dezhong or the hospital to inquire about his condition. Unfortunately, the bad news eventually arrived.

	The Central Committee's obituary has already praised Comrade Hu Yaobang highly. I will only add a few words about his role during the War of Liberation in North China, where he served as the political commissar of the column and the commander of the corps. He was very skilled at political work, often going deep into the grassroots, covering all of North China, explaining the situation and tasks, and promoting and encouraging, making the troops very active and morale high. Those who have worked with or interacted with Comrade Hu Yaobang have nothing but praise for him. Comrade Hu Yaobang participated in the entire process of the North China Liberation War, experiencing all the major battles, until the final victory of the war, making great contributions to the liberation of the people of North China.

	Now that the deceased cannot be brought back to life, the living can only cherish the memory. Remembering the deceased to inspire oneself, recalling the past to promote the new. Therefore, I hope you will definitely grieve and take care of your health, educate your descendants to inherit the unfinished work of their ancestors, and continue to strive for the rejuvenation of China!

　　致胡耀邦同志夫人信
    聂荣臻
    李昭同志：
    耀邦同志不幸先我而去，令我非常痛心！我已年迈老残，常寄希望于年轻或较年轻的一代，今耀邦同志逝世，确使我痛惜。当得知耀邦病情后，我是很担心。因我知道这心脏病的厉害，故不断与杨德中同志或医院联系，了解情况，怎奈噩耗终于传来。
    对耀邦同志的评价，中央讣告已讲的很好，我只讲几句，关于他在解放战争时期，在华北部队先后担任纵队政委、兵团主任时的情况。他很善于抓政治工作，经常深入基层，足迹遍及华北，讲形势说任务，宣传鼓动，使部队很活跃，士气高昂。与耀邦共事或接触过的干部和群众没有不称道的。耀邦同志参加了华北解放战争的全过程，历经了各个主要战役，直到战争的最后胜利，为华北人民的解放立了大功。
    现在死者不能复生，生者只有留念心中。思亲以激志，忆旧以促新。所以，望你一定要节哀保重，注意身体，教育子孙继承父祖未竟之业，为振兴中华继续奋斗！
