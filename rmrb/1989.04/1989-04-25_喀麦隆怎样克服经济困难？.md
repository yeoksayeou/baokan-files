	Cameroon, once known for its abundant resources, is now facing tough times. In this country, tightening administrative spending, strengthening financial discipline, and promoting official integrity and frugality have become the governing principles of all levels of government.

	For many years, Cameroon's economic situation has been relatively good. In the early 1980s, the annual budget doubled, reaching 80 billion CFA francs. With the influx of money, administrative budgets expanded, and financial regulations became lax. According to official sources, the phenomenon of public funds being lost without investigation and extravagant spending without oversight was widespread.

	In recent years, the prices of primary commodities on the international market have plummeted, and the exchange rate of the dollar has depreciated, severely impacting Cameroon's economy. The annual loss has reached 250 billion CFA francs. With declining revenues and over 30 billion dollars in internal and external debts, the national economy is in dire straits. This has forced the Cameroonian government to significantly cut the budget. Despite this, when Cameroonian President Biya announced the arrival of the "economic crisis" on June 20, 1987, many officials and the public found it hard to believe and were reluctant to accept the government's austerity measures. However, soon after, the officials and the public changed their minds, uniting to fight against the economic crisis. This year, Cameroon's economy has begun to recover, prices have stabilized, and bank funds have increased, indicating that their efforts have yielded results.

	The Cameroonian government has mainly taken the following measures:

	Inform the nation of the true state of the "crisis." The government not only let the people understand the real situation and impact of the economic difficulties but also made them aware of the government's determination and plans to overcome the challenges, thereby gaining the people's understanding and support. When the government took measures such as reducing the budget, increasing consumer tax, cutting or eliminating welfare subsidies, and closing some loss-making state-owned enterprises, it did not cause social unrest.

	Promote frugal governance and oppose wastefulness. Originally, every official in Cameroon's government departments, from ministers to directors, had a dedicated car. The use of official cars for private purposes was a common practice. Additionally, officials could freely use administrative funds to set up private phones, with the phone bills paid by the government. After the economic difficulties arose, the Cameroonian government conducted a cleanup, and only ministers and provincial governors were allocated dedicated cars. All vehicles exceeding the specified number in each department were publicly auctioned. Cameroon's Finance Minister Ayatu said that during the 1987-1988 fiscal year, the government departments did not purchase any new cars, and the use of official phones for private purposes had been basically eliminated. These two measures saved over 20 billion CFA francs each year. Now, even if a customer wastes a form in the bank, the clerk will admonish them.

	Severely crack down on corrupt officials. The Cameroonian government has established planning and financial inspection and supervision committees in various departments, which have the power to impose penalties, and higher-level leaders cannot interfere with their work. Corrupt officials at all levels of government, once exposed and investigated, are handed over to the criminal court for prosecution. In the past year and a half, several high-ranking officials who were exposed have been removed from their positions and are currently under investigation along with relevant suspects. A Cameroonian official said that people now treat state property much more seriously than before.

	Require government officials to be models of labor discipline. Since the end of 1987, according to the new system issued by the government, ministers and employees must register their work hours, and those who are late will be reported by the security guards to the relevant units. Without a leave note, security guards will not allow anyone to leave during work hours. Those who violate the rules will be given warnings, deductions in salary, or even dismissed from their jobs, depending on the number of offenses. The past phenomenon of empty offices is now a thing of the past.

　　喀麦隆怎样克服经济困难？
    孙星文
    昔日“财源充裕”的喀麦隆，目前正在艰苦度日。在这个国家，紧缩行政开支，强化财经纪律，为官廉洁俭朴等已成为各级政府的秉政原则。
    多年来，喀麦隆的经济状况一直较好。８０年代初几年中，年度预算翻一番，上升到８０００亿非洲法郎。钱多以后，行政预算膨胀，财务制度松弛。据喀官方透露，公款“丢失”无人追查，挥霍铺张无人过问的现象普遍存在。
    近几年，国际市场上初级产品价格暴跌，兑换货币美元相继贬值，喀麦隆经济因此受到严重影响。年度损失高达２５００亿非洲法郎。收入下降，加之３０多亿美元的内外债务，国家经济异常困难。这迫使喀政府大幅削减预算。尽管如此，当喀麦隆总统比亚１９８７年６月２０日在议会宣布“经济危机来临”的时候，该国许多干部群众都不敢相信，对政府提出的紧缩措施表示难以接受。但此后不久，喀麦隆干部群众就转变了认识，他们团结起来，同经济危机展开斗争。今年，喀经济开始回升，物价稳定，银行资金增加，这说明他们的努力已获得成果。
    喀麦隆政府主要采取了以下措施：
    把“危机”真象告诉全国人民。政府不但让人民了解经济困难的真实情况和影响，还让他们知道政府克服困难的决心和计划，从而得到人民的谅解和支持。当政府采取措施，如压缩预算、提高消费品税收、减少或取消福利补贴、关闭部分亏损国营企业时，没有引起社会波动。
    提倡俭朴办公，反对铺张浪费。原来喀麦隆政府部门从部长到处长每人都有专车。公车私用可谓普遍现象。另外，干部随意动用行政经费设私人电话，电话费公家支付。经济困难发生后，喀政府进行整顿，只有部长和省长配专车，各部门超出规定数的专车一律交付指定单位当众出售。喀财政部长阿亚图说，１９８７至１９８８财政年度，喀政府部门没有添置一辆新车，公设私用家庭电话已基本取消。每年这两项就节省２００多亿非洲法郎。现在，顾客在银行浪费一张填单都会受到营业员的告诫。
    严厉打击贪污分子。喀政府各部门设立计划财会检查监督委员会，它拥有制裁权，各级领导不得干预他们的工作。对各级政府工作人员中的贪污犯，一经检举、查出，均交刑事法庭处置。近一年多中，被揭发出来的几位高级官员已调离政府，正和有关嫌疑犯一同接受审查。一位喀官员说，人们现在对待国家财产比过去大为严肃了。
    要求政府官员成为遵守劳动纪律的模范。自１９８７年底以来，按照政府颁布的新制度，部长和职工都要登记上下班时间，迟到者由门卫上报有关单位。上班时间外出，没有假条门卫不放行。对违禁者，将根据次数多少，分别给予警告、扣工资或开除公职等处罚。办公室过去那种常唱“空城计”的现象现在已经没有了。
