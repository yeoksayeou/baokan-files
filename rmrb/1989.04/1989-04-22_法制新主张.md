    New proposals for legal reform have emerged in Britain, suggesting that parents who condone their children's criminal activities should face severe penalties in court.

    The strongest advocate for this measure is John Patten, a Minister of State for the Home Department. He argues that parents who are aware of their children's criminal activities but fail to intervene should be "touched" by the law. When their children are brought to trial, these parents should be compelled to appear in court and be held responsible for paying fines, legal fees, or compensation. He proposes expanding the court's authority to "restrain the parents of criminal children."

    In recent years, Britain has seen a persistent high crime rate, with a significant portion of crimes committed by juveniles under the age of 17. Statistics show that one in every four criminals is a juvenile. Authorities blame some families for not teaching their children right from wrong, and even for failing to stop their children when they know they are committing crimes. The authorities have been racking their brains over this issue. Now, Patten has come up with what he calls his "last resort" to try to turn the situation around, reportedly aiming to strengthen parents' sense of responsibility.

    Patten's proposal has naturally sparked different reactions. A spokesperson for the opposition Labour Party said that Patten's proposal is "an attempt by the government to divert public attention from the fact that the crime rate has increased by 50%." The British Probation Officers Association called the proposal "unimplementable" and "ineffective," among other criticisms. An editorial in The Times, after a detailed analysis of the proposal, pointed out that irresponsible parents do need to be subject to legal sanctions, and Patten's intentions are commendable. The current issue, however, is how to clearly define when parents "knew in advance" about their children's criminal activities and failed to stop them. It is unreasonable to expect parents to know everything their children do, especially since many juvenile crimes are impulsive. Requiring parents to constantly monitor their children's activities is impractical.

　　法制新主张
    “纵容子女犯罪的父母应受到法庭的严厉制裁”，英国国内最近出现了这种新主张。
    极力主张这样做的是英国内政部国务大臣约翰·帕坦先生。他说，对那些明知自己的子女在犯罪而不加制止的父母有必要“触动”一下，犯罪子女受审，“应强迫其父母出庭”，并责令他们为其子女支付罚款、诉讼费或赔偿费。他建议扩大法院“约束犯罪子女父母”的权力。
    近年，英国的犯罪率居高不下，而其中不足１７岁的青少年犯罪所占比例不小。据统计，每四名罪犯中就有一名是少年犯。当局指责一些家庭不教导其子女辨别是非曲直，甚至明知孩子在犯罪却不去制止。当局为此煞费苦心。现在，帕坦先生拿出了他称之为的“最后一招”，力图扭转局面，据说其目的是为了加强父母的“责任感”。
    帕坦先生的建议自然引起了不同的反响，反对党工党的发言人说，帕坦先生的建议“是政府试图转移公众对犯罪率增加５０％这一事实的注意力”。英国监督缓刑犯官员联合会称此项建议“无法实施”，“不会产生效果”，等等。《泰晤士报》一篇社论在对此建议作了较详细的分析后指出，不负责任的父母有必要接受法律制裁，帕坦先生的用心没有问题。现在的问题是，如何明确父母“预先知道”子女的犯罪行动而没有制止？孩子出外做什么父母不可能“事先知道”，因为很多青少年犯罪是一时的冲动，要求父母们长时间监管孩子的行动是没有道理的。
