China has made significant progress in synchrotron radiation technology. The first dedicated synchrotron radiation device has been completed and successfully emitted light. This technology is now at the world's forefront and will be open to domestic and international users.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Hefei on April 26th, reporters learned today at midnight that China's first dedicated synchrotron radiation device was officially completed and successfully emitted light at 1:08 AM Beijing Summer Time. From the first injection of the electron beam into the storage ring to the acquisition of the stored beam flow and the production of strong synchrotron radiation light, it took only 23 hours. Experts believe that this light emission speed is rare among similar devices worldwide.

This achievement follows the successful collision of the Beijing Electron-Positron Collider and is another major breakthrough in China's high-tech field. It signifies that China's technology for building synchrotron radiation accelerators has entered the world's advanced ranks.

The National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, which began construction in 1984, is located in the new campus area of the University of Science and Technology of China in the southern suburbs of Hefei. It was independently designed, manufactured, installed, and debugged by Chinese scientists. The construction of this project has received high attention from the Party and state leaders. Deng Xiaoping has always been concerned about this project and provided strong support; Zhao Ziyang, the General Secretary, once visited the site. Many central leaders have shown concern for the project's progress and helped solve construction difficulties. Many famous foreign scientists, such as Yang Zhenning, Li Zhengdao, Wu Jianxiong, Yuan Jiaqiu, Ding Zhaozhong, and domestic scientific pioneers like Wang Ganchang and Zhang Wenyu, have supported and assisted the project and given it high praise.

Vice President of the University of Science and Technology of China, Bao Zhongmou, told reporters that as a national shared laboratory, this synchrotron radiation device will be open to all domestic units and the world after completion. Currently, five beamlines will be opened, leading to five experimental stations: soft X-ray lithography, X-ray microscopy, photoelectron spectroscopy, time-resolved spectroscopy, and photochemical experiments. Additional beamlines and experimental stations will be gradually built as the number of synchrotron radiation users increases.

　　我国同步辐射技术重大进步    
    首台专用装置建成出光    
    技术居世界前列　将向国内外开放
    据新华社合肥４月２６日电（记者宣奉华、田文喜）记者今日凌晨从中国科技大学获悉：我国第一个专用同步辐射装置于今天北京夏令时１时０８分正式建成并调试出光。从第一次向储存环注入电子束流到获得储存束流，产生很强的同步辐射光，仅用了２３小时。专家们认为，这种调试出光速度在世界同类装置中是罕见的。
    这是继北京正负电子对撞机对撞成功之后，我国高科技领域的又一重大成就，标志着我国建造同步辐射加速器的技术已跨入世界先进行列。
    １９８４年动工兴建的这个国家同步辐射实验室，坐落在合肥市南郊中国科技大学新区校园内，完全是由我国科技人员独立设计、制造、安装和调试成功的。它的建设受到党和国家领导人的高度重视。邓小平同志一直关心这项工程，并给予大力支持；赵紫阳总书记曾亲临视察。中央许多领导同志都关心工程进展，并帮助解决建设中的困难。国外许多著名科学家如杨振宁、李政道、吴健雄、袁家骝、丁肇中等以及国内科学界前辈如王淦昌、张文裕等都对该工程给予支持帮助，并作了高度的评价和赞赏。
    中国科技大学副校长包忠谋对记者说，作为国家级的共用实验室，这个同步辐射装置建成后，将向国内一切单位和全世界开放；目前，先开辟５个窗口，引出５条光束线，建立５个实验站，即软Ｘ射线光刻、Ｘ射线显微术、光电子能谱、分时光谱和光化学实验站。其余光束线和实验站将随着同步辐射用户的增加而逐步增建。
