People often say that education is difficult to manage these days, and being a principal is even harder, especially for middle school principals. Recently, I visited several middle school principals and have summarized their difficulties as follows:

First, the emphasis on high admission rates has increased the pressure on many middle school principals. Currently, people and higher-level leadership departments often evaluate a principal's work based on the admission rate rather than social benefits. The number of key middle school slots is overly saturated, with an average of over 60 students per class. Teachers do not have the energy to teach according to individual abilities or needs, making it difficult to improve teaching quality. Ordinary middle schools have weaker teaching resources, so their admission rates are relatively low. Now, teachers are unhappy about being assigned to ordinary middle schools, and students lack confidence in ordinary middle schools, putting a lot of pressure on principals.

Second, middle school education funding is insufficient, funding sources are unstable, and administrative interference is excessive. Currently, schools are managed at different levels, with the entire city conducting unified enrollment, but management is handled by the local street office. Some schools' facilities do not meet the needs of educational development. For example, the key middle school, City No. 1 Middle School, still does not have a laboratory building; City No. 5 Middle School was originally a primary school and, according to requirements, should have 18 classes, but currently, the school only has 9 classrooms. The school's area and facilities are limited to the scale of a primary school in the early 1970s. Many principals have complained that they have no autonomy in the placement of teaching staff, cannot manage personnel, and cannot hire or fire as needed.

Third, some teachers have poor professional skills and lack a strong sense of duty. Some principals have reported that a significant number of teachers are unqualified. Many young teachers, especially those recently assigned from colleges, lack the spirit of hard work and are not dedicated to their jobs.

Fourth, principals work hard but have low incomes. As the head of a school, a principal must attend various mandatory meetings, participate in various social activities, and handle school affairs. To avoid being detached from teaching, the principal also teaches a subject. They often have no weekends or holidays, yet their income is similar to that of ordinary teachers. Class advisors receive allowances, but principals do not.

Education is a matter that affects the prosperity and development of the entire Chinese nation. The plight of middle school principals should be given high attention by relevant departments and leaders.

### 中学校长的苦衷

　　中学校长的苦衷
    人们都说现在教育难搞，校长难当，尤其是中学校长更难当。最近，我访问了几个中学校长，现将他们的苦衷归纳如下：
    一、片面追求升学率，给不少中学校长增加了压力。现在，人们及上级领导部门，往往以升学率的高低来评价一个校长的工作，而不是看社会效益。重点中学名额过于饱和，每班平均在６０人以上，教师没有精力因材施教，因人施教，很难提高教学质量。普通中学师资力量弱，因此升学率偏低。现在，老师进了普通中学闹情绪，学生进了普通中学没信心，校长的工作压力很大。
    二、中学教育经费不足，资金来源不稳定，行政干预过多。现在，实行分级办校、分级管理，全市统一招生，管理却归所在街道办事处。一些学校的办学条不适应教育发展的需要。我市重点中学市一中至今没有实验楼；市五中原是一所小学，按要求应发展到１８个教学班，而目前学校只有９间教室，学校面积及办学条件仅限于７０年代初的小学规模。不少校长反映，我们对教职员工的安置没有自主权，用人管不了人，想用的调不进，不想用的又调不出。
    三、部分教师业务素质差，事业心不强。一些校长反映，有相当一部分教师不合格，一些青年教师，特别是近年毕业分配来的大专学生，不少人缺乏埋头苦干的精神，不安心教育工作。
    四、校长工作辛苦，经济收入低。作为一校之长，要出席各种必到的会议，参加各种社会活动，处理学校内大小事务。为了不脱离教学，校长还要兼一门课，常常没有星期天，没有节假日，而收入却和普通教师差不多，班主任有津贴，校长却没有。
    教育是关系到整个中华民族兴旺发达的大事，中学校长的苦衷，应引起有关部门和领导的高度重视。
