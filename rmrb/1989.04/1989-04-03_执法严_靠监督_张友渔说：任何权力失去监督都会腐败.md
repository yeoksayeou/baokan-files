		Strict Law Enforcement Depends on Supervision
		Zhang Youyu: Any Power Without Supervision Will Corrupt

		According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 2 (Reporter Yang Huiming) Zhang Youyu, honorary president of the China Law Society, recently accepted an interview with a reporter and said that the key to solving the prominent problem of lax law enforcement at present is to strengthen the supervision of the People's Congress and public opinion supervision.

		When talking about many deputies to the People's Congress calling for lax law enforcement as a prominent problem, 91-year-old Zhang said that recognizing this problem and paying attention to it is a good thing. In recent years, although the People's Congress has enacted many laws, the work of supervising law enforcement has not been done well. The problem of having laws but not enforcing them, and lax law enforcement, is prominent. If laws lose their seriousness and authority, the problem of weak rule of law will be more prominent.

		Zhang Youyu said that apart from the lack of supervision by the People's Congress, administrative and judicial organs also have responsibilities for lax law enforcement. There are many cases where administrative organs do not act according to legal procedures. There are also many cases where higher-level administrative organs shield lower-level administrative organs and interfere with specific judicial work. Some cases are judged by the court but cannot be executed. For this reason, the "Administrative Litigation Law" was formulated. Of course, the problem is not solved just because this law is enacted. There is also the issue of supervising law enforcement.

		Regarding the question of whether the news media criticizing judicial organs will affect the authority of judicial organs, Zhang Youyu's view is: lax law enforcement or bias is the most damaging to the authority of judicial organs. The more powerful an institution is, the more it should accept public opinion supervision. He said, any power without supervision will produce corruption.

### 执法严　靠监督  张友渔说：任何权力失去监督都会腐败

　　执法严　靠监督
    张友渔说：任何权力失去监督都会腐败
    据新华社北京４月２日电  （记者羊慧明）中国法学会名誉会长张友渔日前接受记者采访时说，解决当前执法不严突出的问题，最重要的是加强人大的监督和舆论监督。
    谈到许多人大代表呼吁执法不严已成为一个突出问题时，９１岁高龄的张老说，意识到了这个问题，引起重视，是件好事。这几年人大虽然制定了不少法律，但监督执法的工作做得不够，有法不依，执法不严的问题突出。法律失去严肃性、权威性，法制观念淡薄的问题就会更突出。
    张友渔说，执法不严，除了人大监督不力的原因外，行政、司法机关也有责任。行政机关本身不按法律程序办事的事情就不少。上级行政机关包庇下级行政机关，干预具体审判工作的也不少。有的案子法院判了，也执行不了。正因为这样，制定了个《行政诉讼法》。当然，不是这个法出台了，问题就解决了，这本身也有个监督执法的问题。
    新闻媒介批评司法机构会不会影响司法机构的威信？对这个有争论的问题，张友渔的看法是：执法不严或有偏差才是最损害司法机关威信的。越是有权力的机构，越要接受舆论的监督。他说，任何权力失去监督都会产生腐败。
