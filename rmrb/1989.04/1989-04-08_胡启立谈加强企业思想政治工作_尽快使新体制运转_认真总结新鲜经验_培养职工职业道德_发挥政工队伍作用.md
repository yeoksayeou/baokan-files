	Hu Qili on Strengthening Enterprise Ideological and Political Work
	Quickly Implement New Systems, Summarize Fresh Experiences, Foster Workers' Professional Ethics, and Utilize the Political Work Team

	People's Daily reports: The April 8 issue of the magazine "Ideological and Political Work Research" published a speech by Hu Qili, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, on strengthening enterprise ideological and political work. He pointed out that at present, we must quickly establish and improve the new system of ideological and political work. Both factory directors and party secretaries must adapt to the new system and quickly take their positions.

	First, we must firmly implement the CPC Central Committee's notice on strengthening and improving enterprise ideological and political work. We must treat the study and implementation of the spirit of the notice and the strengthening and improvement of enterprise ideological and political work as a major task. For those who have established new systems, we must quickly put them into operation. Only through operation can the new system be firmly established and gradually improved.

	Second, we must seriously summarize the new experiences in enterprise ideological and political work. The key now is to take the work to the grassroots level. We should not just talk about it or stop at discussing the system. Instead, we should seriously summarize a batch of typical experiences in various fields of ideological and political work, including schools, enterprises, and rural areas, and provide classified guidance.

	Third, we must strive to create an enterprise spirit and strengthen the construction of professional ethics. Comrades engaged in enterprise ideological and political work must, in combination with the characteristics of their enterprises, cultivate through their strong ideological and political work a group consciousness that has both social commonality and its own characteristics. At the same time, we must vigorously foster professional ethics such as being responsible to society, cooperating and respecting each other, being loyal to one's duties, and studying professional skills.

	Fourth, we must strengthen the construction of the ideological and political work team. In the process of establishing and operating the new system of enterprise ideological and political work, the team of full-time political workers remains an indispensable important force and should further play their leading role. All ideological and political workers should strive to study Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, a little educational science, psychology, and research human behavioral psychology. They should learn to "use one key to open one lock" and maximize the initiative and enthusiasm of the people.

　　胡启立谈加强企业思想政治工作
    尽快使新体制运转　认真总结新鲜经验  培养职工职业道德　发挥政工队伍作用
    本报讯  ４月８日出版的《思想政治工作研究》杂志发表了中共中央政治局常委胡启立关于加强企业思想政治工作的讲话。他指出，当前要抓紧建立和完善思想政治工作的新体制，厂长和书记都要适应新体制，尽快到位。
    一要坚定地贯彻落实中共中央关于加强和改进企业思想政治工作的通知。把学习、贯彻《通知》精神，加强和改进企业思想政治工作当成一件大事来抓。建立了新体制的，就要尽快地运转起来，也只有在运转中间才能把新体制稳固地建立起来，并且逐步地加以完善。
    二要认真总结企业思想政治工作的新鲜经验。现在的关键在于把工作做到基层去，不要坐而论道，不要停留在体制格局的讨论上，而要在思想政治工作的各个领域，包括学校、企业、农村，都来认真下功夫总结一批典型经验，分类进行指导。
    三要努力创建企业精神，加强职业道德建设。我们从事企业思想政治工作的同志，要结合所在企业的特点，通过自己强有力的思想政治工作，培育出既有社会共性，又有自己特色的群体意识。与此同时，要大力培养对社会负责、团结协作、互相尊重、忠于职守、钻研业务等职业道德。
    四要加强思想政治工作队伍的建设。在企业思想政治工作新体制建立和运行的过程中，专职政工干部队伍仍然是一支不可缺少的重要力量，应当进一步发挥他们的骨干作用。广大思想政治工作者都要努力学习马列主义、毛泽东思想，学一点教育学、心理学，研究人的行为心理，学会“一把钥匙开一把锁”，最大限度地调动人的积极性和主动性。
