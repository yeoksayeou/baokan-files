	China's current economic life still faces numerous challenges. Prices, fiscal expenditures, and consumption demand remain high, while industrial structure and investment structure are irrational.

	According to the spokesperson of the National Bureau of Statistics, Zhang Zhongji, today, the main issues in China's current economic life are three persistent highs and two irrationalities.

	The three persistent highs are:

	— The overall price level remains high. The national retail price index, which rose by 18.5% last year, increased by 6.8% in February compared to December of the previous year. The upward trend slowed in March, remaining basically the same as the previous month.

	— Fiscal expenditures are growing at a high rate, far outpacing the growth of fiscal revenue. In the first quarter, domestic fiscal expenditures increased by 16.3% compared to the same period last year, significantly higher than the 4.9% growth rate of fiscal revenue.

	— Consumption demand is growing at a high rate, with excessive issuance of money and goods still occurring.

	The two irrationalities are:

	— The industrial internal structure is becoming more irrational, leading to a decline in economic efficiency and affecting the improvement of social effective supply. First, industrial development continues to lean towards non-state-owned industries with low economic efficiency and weak effective supply. In the first quarter, the output value of state-owned industry grew by 5.2%; the output value of collective industry grew by 18%, with township and village enterprises growing by 27.7%. Second, industrial development continues to lean towards investment-type products and high-end durable consumer goods in processing industries, while the growth of energy, raw materials, agricultural support products, and daily necessities for the people is slow or negative.

	The irrational structure and disorderly circulation and financial order have led to a decline in efficiency. In the first quarter, the state-owned industrial enterprises within the budget realized a tax profit of 3.539 billion yuan, an increase of only 4.3% compared to the same period last year (with profits decreasing by 14%), comparable product costs exceeding the budget by 15.8%, and the loss amount of loss-making enterprises expanding.

	— The investment structure is irrational. First, central projects are slow to start, while local projects are fast to start. In the first quarter, the investment in basic construction projects was 7.32 billion yuan for central projects, a decrease of 8.3% compared to the same period last year; 5.76 billion yuan for local projects, an increase of 14.8%. Second, investments in electricity, raw materials, transportation, and postal services have decreased. In the first quarter, basic construction investment in electricity decreased by 6.5%, investment in raw material industries decreased by 9.7%, and investment in transportation and postal services decreased by 2%.

　　当前我国经济生活难题仍多    
    物价、财政支出、消费需求居高不下工业内部结构和投资结构不合理
    本报北京４月２１日讯  记者张国荣报道：国家统计局新闻发言人章钟基今天说，当前我国经济生活中依然存在诸多难题，主要表现在三个居高不下和两个不合理。
    三个居高不下是：
    ——物价总水平居高不下。全国零售物价总水平在去年上升１８．５％的基础上，今年２月份比去年１２月又上升６．８％，３月份涨势趋缓，与上月基本持平。
    ——财政支出增幅居高不下，大大快于财政收入增长。一季度，国内财政支出比去年同期增长１６．３％，高于财政收入增长４．９％的速度。
    ——消费需求增长居高不下，滥发钱物现象仍不少。
    两个不合理是：
    ——工业内部结构更加不合理，经济效益下降，影响社会有效供给改善。一是工业发展继续向经济效益低、增加有效供给较弱的非全民工业倾斜。一季度，全民工业产值增长５．２％；集体工业产值增长１８％，其中乡办工业产值增长２７．７％。二是工业发展继续向加工工业中的投资类产品和高档耐用消费品倾斜，能源、原材料、支农产品和群众必需的日用消费品增长缓慢或负增长。
    结构的不合理和流通、金融秩序混乱带来了效益的下降。一季度预算内国营工业实现税利３５３．９亿元，仅比去年同期增长４．３％（其中实现利润下降１４％），可比产品成本超支１５．８％，亏损企业亏损额扩大。
    ——投资结构不合理。一是中央项目上得慢，地方项目上得快。一季度基本建设投资额中，中央项目７３．２亿元，比去年同期下降８．３％；地方项目５７．６亿元，增长１４．８％。二是电力、原材料、运输、邮电投资下降。一季度，基本建设电力投资下降６．５％，原材料工业投资下降９．７％，运输邮电投资下降２％。
