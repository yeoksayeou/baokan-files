The Ministry of Chemical Industry is mobilizing efforts to ensure the production of fertilizers and pesticides. Zhou Jiahua stated: Those who cause delays will be held accountable.

	Reported by Jiang Shaogao from Beijing, April 20th: State Councilor Zhou Jiahua said today that agricultural production is seasonal, and amidst various contradictions and difficulties, we must prioritize agriculture. Increasing material inputs for agriculture is crucial, and this involves ensuring the production and supply of fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural films. No link in the chain should create obstacles for any reason; otherwise, those who cause delays will be held accountable.

	The first quarter of this year saw a less than satisfactory chemical production situation nationwide. Out of 16 major chemical products, 7 did not meet the planned targets, particularly fertilizers and pesticides, which fell short of production targets and directly affected agricultural production. In response, the Ministry of Chemical Industry held a teleconference to mobilize local chemical departments and enterprises to focus on rectification and production, striving to complete the production tasks of 43 million tons of fertilizers and 100,000 tons of pesticides in the first half of the year.

	Zhou Jiahua emphasized that all pesticide enterprises must find ways to increase production. Departments and enterprises supplying raw materials for pesticide production must actively provide these materials. The coordination of pesticide raw materials and the allocation of finished pesticides should follow a "national unified chessboard" approach, adhering to the state's unified allocation.

　　化工部动员抓好化肥农药生产    
    邹家华说：谁误事追究谁的责任
    本报北京４月２０日讯  记者江绍高报道：国务委员邹家华今天说，农业增产具有季节性，在各种矛盾和困难中，要为农业让路。增加对农业的物资投入，关键是抓好化肥、农药、农膜的生产和供应。任何环节都不得以任何理由设置障碍，否则，谁误事追究谁的责任。
    今年第一季度，全国化工生产形势不容乐观，１６种主要化工产品，有７种没有完成计划，尤其是化肥、农药欠产，直接影响农业生产。为此，化工部召开电话会议，动员各地化工部门和企业一心一意进行治理整顿，全力以赴搞好当前生产，力争上半年完成化肥４３００万吨、农药１０万吨的生产任务。
    邹家华强调，所有的农药企业要想方设法增加生产，供应农药生产原料的部门和企业，要积极为农药部门提供原料。农药原料的配套和农药成药的调配，要有“全国一盘棋”思想，服从国家统一调拨。
