	Workers have unions, women have the Women's Federation, individual business owners have the Individual Laborers' Association, and farmers should also have an organization to speak for themselves, such as a Farmers' Association. This was the suggestion made by several farmer representatives during a provincial people's congress meeting.

	In recent years, farmers' interests in some places have often been infringed upon. Heavy taxes are constantly demanded, and the prices of pesticides and fertilizers keep rising, leaving farmers with little motivation to produce. What angers farmers the most is that when cotton and tobacco are in low demand and cannot be sold, they have to wait in lines several kilometers long for relevant departments to purchase them. At this time, no one regulates the prices or the purchasing process. Once cotton and tobacco become scarce, and someone is willing to pay for them, then regulations come into play: prices cannot be raised arbitrarily, and hoarding or bulk purchasing is not allowed. The market principle of "selling to the highest bidder" is no longer applicable. Some people say that these products are not subject to market regulation but are included in planned procurement and sales. However, why are they not included in the plan when farmers cannot sell them? Apart from selling tobacco leaves and cotton, farmers also face similar issues when selling chestnuts, sweet potatoes, silkworm cocoons, and silk floss. Farmers' hearts have been repeatedly hurt, so they hope to establish a "Farmers' Association" to protect their interests.

	I believe that protecting farmers' legitimate interests must be the foundation of our rural work and should not be taken lightly. We must continue to deepen the reform and improve the market regulation mechanism, making the prices and value ratios of industrial and agricultural products more reasonable. If farmers' low-priced cotton, tobacco, grains, oilseeds, and silkworm cocoons are taken, then farmers should be provided with low-priced fertilizers, pesticides, diesel, and agricultural film, so they have both losses and gains. In summary, a Farmers' Association is not necessarily required, but someone should definitely protect farmers' immediate interests.

### 说说“农民协会”

　　说说“农民协会”
　　河南郑州市　陈贞权
    “工人有工会，妇女有妇联，个体户有个体劳动者协会，农民也该有个为自己说话的团体，比如农民协会。”这是某省人代会讨论时，几个农民代表的建议。
    这几年，一些地方农民的利益经常受到侵害。苛捐杂税一个劲要，农药、化肥价格一个劲涨，弄得农民几乎没了生产积极性。最令农民生气的是，棉花、烟叶贱了，卖不出去，农民排几公里长队等着有关部门收购。这时，既没有人管价格，也没有人管收购。一旦棉花、烟叶成了紧俏货，有人愿掏钱买了，于是便有人管了：不准擅自提价、加价，不准套购、抢购。“哪里价高卖哪里，谁出高价卖给谁”的市场规律到这时就不讲了。有人说，这些产品本就不属于市场调节而是纳入计划购销的，可在农民卖不出去时，为何不纳入计划呢？农民除了出售烟叶、棉花存在这种情况外，出售板栗、山芋、蚕茧、丝绵等农产品也遇到这样的问题。农民的心一再被伤害，于是便希望成立“农民协会”，以便维护自己的利益。
    我认为，必须保护农民的正当利益，这一点要作为我们农村工作的基石，切不可掉以轻心。要继续深化改革，完善市场调节机制，使工农业产品的价格、比值更趋合理。拿了农民的低价棉花、烟叶、粮食、油料、蚕茧，就要给农民低价的化肥、农药、柴油、农膜，使他们有失有得。总而言之，农民协会不一定非有不可，但农民的切身利益却应该有人来维护。
