Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, April 29th - (Reporter Chen Guangjun) Jilin City has carried out an activity where workers evaluate enterprise contractors from the bottom up. Recently, more than 2,380 contractors who have a strong democratic consciousness and are supported by the workers have been awarded material rewards, salary increases, and promotions. More than 840 contractors who performed poorly have been demoted, dismissed, or received administrative penalties. Economists believe that this measure effectively upholds the democratic rights of workers and further improves the self-constraint mechanism of enterprises.

It is understood that since last year, most enterprises in Jilin City have implemented a bidding and mortgage contracting system. To give full play to the supervisory role of the workers, and to ensure that workers truly exercise their democratic rights, various levels of workers' congresses in enterprises carried out activities to evaluate factory directors (managers), workshop directors, and section chiefs in early January. Contractors at various levels first gave work reports to the workers, introducing their work situation to the masses, and then the representatives of the workers' congress voted to evaluate the contractors. The evaluation results show that among the 13,547 contractors in the city, more than 90% pay attention to the exercise of workers' democratic rights, and the workers are relatively satisfied. Among them, 17.6% of the contractors performed exceptionally well, while 6% performed poorly.

　　维护民主权利　完善约束机制    
    吉林市职工评议承包人
    据新华社长春４月２９日电（记者陈广俊）吉林市通过开展职工自下而上的评议企业承包人活动，最近对２３８０多名民主意识较强、受到职工拥护的企业承包人分别给予了物质奖励和晋升工资并提拔重用；８４０多名表现较差的企业承包人受到撤职、免职，或行政处分。经济界人士认为，这一措施有效地维护了职工的民主权利，进一步完善了企业的自我约束机制。
    据了解，去年以来，吉林市的大多数企业实行了招标抵押承包。为了发挥职工群众对企业领导的监督作用，保证职工真正行使民主权利，今年元旦前后，企业的各级职工代表大会开展了职工评议厂长（经理）、车间主任、科长的活动。各级承包人先向职工做述职报告，向群众介绍自己的工作情况，然后由职代会代表对承包人投票评议。评议结果表明，全市的１３５４７名承包人当中，９０％以上重视职工民主权利的发挥，职工比较满意，其中１７．６％的承包人表现突出，而表现差的占６％。
