Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, April 6th. (Hebei Daily reporter Zhang Xijie, Xinhua News Agency reporter Yang Shuxun) Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Li Xiannian this afternoon visited Wudu Village in Hengshui City.

Hengshui Region is located in the Black Dragon River basin, with relatively poor agricultural production conditions. Historically, it has been a well-known impoverished area. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Hengshui Region has undergone significant changes. In May 1988, the regional committee and administrative office had written to Li Xiannian, reporting the region's development and changes.

Li Xiannian is very concerned about the living and production conditions of the farmers in Hengshui Region. The day after the closing of the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress, he came to Hebei. Li Xiannian encouraged the cadres and the masses to definitely focus on grain production, increase agricultural investment, pay attention to the use of farm manure, and develop water conservancy facilities to achieve better agricultural harvests.

　　李先念在河北农村视察
    新华社石家庄４月６日电  （河北日报记者张锡杰、新华社记者杨树勋）全国政协主席李先念今天下午到衡水市吴杜村视察。
    衡水地区地处黑龙港流域，农业生产条件较差，历史上是有名的贫困地区。党的十一届三中全会以来，衡水地区农村发生了很大变化，１９８８年５月，地委、行署曾经给李先念同志写信，汇报了全区的发展变化情况。
    李先念对衡水地区农民的生活生产情况十分关心，七届全国人大二次会议闭幕的第二天就来到河北。李先念勉励干部群众一定要抓好粮食生产，增加农业投入，注意多施农家肥，兴修水利设施，夺取农业的更好收成。
