	Wei Mingsheng took advantage of a transfer opportunity to eat his way through more than 50 units, displaying such shameless behavior that it truly shocked many people. Many upright comrades have resisted him, and once this was exposed to public opinion, it inevitably aroused public outrage.

	Our newspaper revealed this scandal on March 26. Party rules and discipline are in place, so what has happened to this "eating and drinking specialist" now?

	From the report, it seems that Wei Mingsheng has calmly gone to the provincial capital to take up his post as deputy director of the Provincial Economic Commission. Then what about the criticism? What is Wei Mingsheng's understanding of the situation? How have the relevant departments handled it? If there has been a handling, there should be some response, right? Many readers are paying attention to this, and without an explanation, it seems hard to justify.

　　何时有回音？
    杜若
    魏明生借调动之机，一张大嘴吃遍５０多家单位，如此不顾廉耻，着实令人吃惊，许多正派的同志予以抵制，一旦诉诸舆论激起公愤，也是在所难免。
    本报３月２６日已向全国披露了这一丑闻。党规党纪俱在，这位“吃喝专员”现在究竟怎样了呢？
    从报道看，魏明生好像安然赴省城任省经委副主任去了。那么，批评呢？魏明生有何认识？有关部门又是如何处理的？如果作了处理，总该有个回音吧？许多读者关注着，不作个交待，恐怕是说不过去的。
