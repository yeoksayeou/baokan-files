In recent days, the people of the capital have mourned the passing of the great proletarian revolutionary and statesman Hu Yaobang in various ways.

Many Beijing residents were shocked by the news of Comrade Hu Yaobang's untimely death and deeply regret the loss of this outstanding leader. A young female cadre from the Communist Youth League told a reporter, "Comrade Hu Yaobang was full of ideas, worked hard, and always demanded much of himself. He respected intellectuals and did a lot of work for the Party. The people will forever remember him."

Scientist Qian Sanqiang, who has known Comrade Hu Yaobang since the 1950s, sighed "What a pity, what a pity!" upon hearing the news of Hu Yaobang's death. He said, "Comrade Hu Yaobang respected knowledge and respected scientists, and he devoted a great deal of effort to the development of science in China."

Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Rong Yiren told a reporter, "Comrade Hu Yaobang was upright, had a strong sense of justice, and was willing to take on responsibilities. The China International Trust and Investment Corporation received his care and support during its establishment and development."

Delegates attending the second session of the seventh Beijing Municipal Political Consultative Conference expressed their sorrow over Comrade Hu Yaobang's passing. Delegate Zhao Zhizhen said, "On the morning of the 15th, someone told us that Comrade Yaobang had passed away. I was too shocked to eat. Former Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau Liu Hanjie said, "The obituary from the Central Committee gave a very high evaluation of Comrade Yaobang's life, which is in line with reality and the wishes of the broad masses of the people."

Many members of the Beijing Municipal Political Consultative Conference highly praised Comrade Hu Yaobang's character and his efficient working style. Former head of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Parks Li Li said, "Comrade Yaobang, when he served as the first secretary of the Communist Youth League Central Committee, paid great attention to the park construction in Beijing and led the youth league cadres to plant trees in Yongding River, Chaobai River, and Xishan. His noble character of being strict with himself and setting an example for others is forever worth learning from."

On the morning of the 16th, workers at the Beijing People's Machinery Factory started discussing the news of Comrade Hu Yaobang's passing as soon as they arrived at work. The workers praised Comrade Hu Yaobang for his approachable manner and his deep involvement with the masses. Technician Deng Shulan said, "Comrade Yaobang is a model in this regard."

An elderly Communist Party member stood in silence for a long time upon hearing the news of Comrade Yaobang's passing and expressed his mourning. He said, "Comrade Hu Yaobang, with his extraordinary courage and wisdom, made bold reforms, corrected wrong cases, and rehabilitated many senior cadres. He had the people in his heart, and the people will forever remember him."

Students from Peking University and other institutions of higher learning have been holding memorial activities in recent days to mourn the passing of Comrade Hu Yaobang. White flowers, wreaths, and banners express their sorrow.

Students from the China Youth University of Politics and Law canceled their planned dance and movie nights upon hearing the news of Comrade Hu Yaobang's passing to mourn their former principal. Party Committee Secretary Zhao Ximing said, "Comrade Hu Yaobang was deeply involved with the masses and cared for the country and its people. No matter how difficult the conditions were, he always insisted on going to the grassroots to understand the true situation of the people's lives. This excellent style of being close to the masses and serving the people wholeheartedly is forever worth learning from for our younger generation."
