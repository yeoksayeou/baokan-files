Guangxi has established agricultural wealth-creation technical schools to train farmers. The "100-day large pig micro-element additive" developed by these schools has shown significant economic benefits.

The school has conducted training classes on the "100-day rapid pig raising method," training over 30,000 people. Additionally, it has provided free training for 1,800 farmers from 13 impoverished counties in Guangxi. People from provinces such as Hunan, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Shaanxi have also come to learn. According to a survey, over 80% of the trainees have achieved economic results.
