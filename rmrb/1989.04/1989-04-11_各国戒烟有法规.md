Various countries have regulations on quitting smoking.

Initially, only a few countries legislated against smoking after discovering its harmful effects. However, since the first World No-Tobacco Day was observed on April 7 last year, the number of countries with anti-smoking legislation has significantly increased. According to materials published by the World Health Organization, before 1982, only 31 countries had laws restricting smoking in public places. By last year, this number had risen to 68 countries, with 47 of them implementing laws to restrict smoking in public spaces.

The United Nations has advocated for smoking bans and set a good example.

To commemorate the first World No-Tobacco Day, the World Health Organization headquarters decided that "all staff members are not allowed to smoke in the headquarters building."

The United States is one of the countries that initiated the anti-smoking movement. Out of its 50 states, 45 have enacted laws restricting smoking in public places. Of these, 34 states prohibit smoking in hospitals, schools, carriages, elevators, and other public spaces. Additionally, 32 cities and counties have passed and issued orders restricting smoking. According to official statistics from the United States, the number of smokers has decreased by nearly half compared to two years ago.

On New Year's Day last year, the Canadian federal government decided to ban smoking in all government offices. On July 7, the parliament passed the "Tobacco Products Control Order," which, in addition to banning cigarette advertisements, imposes heavy taxes on tobacco products.

Australia, Ireland, and other countries have issued regulations prohibiting individuals under the age of 16 from smoking and explicitly stating that it is illegal to sell cigarettes to minors, with fines imposed for violations. Portugal prohibits smoking in all places where young people are active, with severe penalties for violations.

Sweden has the strictest penalties, with the law stipulating that serious offenders will be dismissed from public office.

On September 1, 1987, Belgium and other countries implemented regulations prohibiting smoking in public buildings, including hospitals, schools, and post offices. Violators face a fine of 18,000 francs. To enforce the anti-smoking law, "smoking inspectors" have been appointed. They are strict and impartial in their enforcement, ensuring that violators are punished.

In 1986, the Argentine government enacted a law prohibiting advertisements on cigarette packaging and tobacco products, and banning the sale of cigarettes to individuals under the age of 18. The Norwegian government also stipulates that 12 health hazard warnings must be printed on cigarette packaging in rotation; otherwise, the cigarettes cannot be manufactured.

Finland prohibits smoking in all public places and strictly manages it from a business perspective. The country requires that private restaurants, bars, and other establishments must designate non-smoking areas; otherwise, they are not allowed to operate.

The British government has a new approach to banning smoking. According to the British "Financial Times," in addition to regular measures, the government is drafting a law to isolate smokers from non-smokers.

　　各国戒烟有法规
　　柯宝成
    最初发现烟害后立法戒烟的国家仅是凤毛麟角。但自去年４月７日，全世界举行第一个无烟日以来，立法戒烟之国一下多了起来。据世界卫生组织公布的材料，在１９８２年以前，世界上仅有３１个国家立法限制在公共场所吸烟。而去年就增加到６８个国家立法戒烟，其中有４７个国家限制在公共场所吸烟。
    联合国倡导禁烟，并作出了好的表率。
    为纪念第一个世界无烟日，世界卫生组织总部作出决定：“总部工作人员一律不准在总部办公楼内吸烟。”
    美国是当代禁烟运动发起国之一。它的５０个州中已有４５个州颁布了限制在公共场所吸烟的法律，其中３４个州规定禁止在医院、学校、车厢、电梯等公共场所吸烟，还有３２个市、县通过并发布了限制吸烟的法令。据美国官方统计，现在吸烟者比两年前减少了近一半。
    去年元旦，加拿大联邦政府曾作出决定，禁止在政府所有办公场所吸烟。７月７日，议会通过了《烟草产品控制法令》，除禁止香烟广告外，还对烟草产品课以重税。
    澳大利亚、爱尔兰等国颁布法令，禁止１６岁以下的人吸烟，还明文规定不得向未成年人出售香烟，否则罚款。葡萄牙禁止在青少年活动的一切场所吸烟，不然要重罚。
    处罚最重的是瑞典，该国法令对违法情节严重的，要开除公职。
    １９８７年９月１日，比利时等国规定禁止在包括医院，学校，邮局等在内的公共建筑物里吸烟，违者一次罚款１．８万法郎。为执行禁烟法，特设了“禁烟监督员”。他们个个铁面无私，执法认真，违者必究。
    阿根廷政府１９８６年颁布过一项法律，禁止在香烟包装上和烟草产品上做广告，并不准向１８岁以下的未成年人出售香烟。挪威政府还规定１２种危害健康内容的标语必须轮流印在香烟包装上面，否则香烟不得出厂。
    芬兰禁止在所有公共场所吸烟，并从营业上严加管理。该国规定，包括私营饭店、酒吧等必须开辟禁烟区，不然不准营业。
    英国政府禁烟有新招，据英国《金融时报》报道，除常规外，政府正在制定一项把吸烟者与非吸烟者隔离的法令。
