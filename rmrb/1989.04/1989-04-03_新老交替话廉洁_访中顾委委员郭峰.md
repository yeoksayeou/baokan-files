New and Old Leaders Discuss Integrity
— An Interview with Guo Feng, Member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference

By Yīn Pǐnduān, Reporter for The People's Daily

After stepping down from his leadership position, Guo Feng, who modestly describes himself as mainly "facing the past and avoiding the present (busy with writing memoirs)," actually remains attentive to the construction of the Party and the work and growth of the new leadership and new cadres.

During a break in a meeting, the reporter interviewed Guo Feng. When asked how senior comrades, after stepping down from their leadership positions, can help the new leadership and new cadres maintain integrity in governance, Guo Feng said: The 13th Party Congress proposed to strengthen Party discipline, to cleanse the Party of corrupt elements, and to deal with unqualified Party members. This is undoubtedly correct. However, if the integrity of the leadership and cadres is not well-managed, even if eight million unqualified grassroots Party members are expelled, it will not solve the fundamental problem of Party construction. The key is leadership. Whether the new leadership and new cadres are clean or not is a major issue related to the success or failure of the Party. Currently, the members of the new leadership are quite good in terms of youth, knowledge, and professionalism, and they can open up the work. However, they are relatively weak in terms of revolutionary spirit. This is mainly reflected in their low political and ideological qualities, poor theoretical level of Marxism-Leninism, lack of basic Party knowledge, and insufficient Party spirit. For example, some new cadres, after taking up a new post in a new place, do not first consider how to do a good job, but rush to "build a nest," arranging their own "four pillars and eight beams," bringing in classmates and friends into the leadership team, believing that only in this way can they "stand firm." Some people call this "forming a cabinet," but in fact, this kind of camaraderie and cabinet formation are two different things. Some seek enjoyment, extravagance, and waste, indulge in eating, drinking, and gift-giving, choose the best cars, and also pursue high-end housing and furniture. Some are keen on going abroad to grab foreign goods, and some even engage in corruption and bribery.

These phenomena, though not numerous, exist to some extent in various levels of leadership. For these phenomena, we retired senior comrades have the responsibility to do a good job in passing down, helping, and guiding. Passing down: teaching and imparting both positive and negative experiences; helping: helping to solve problems and offer advice; guiding: guiding a good style.

During the two major adjustments of the leadership in the Liaoning Provincial Committee and the Shenyang Municipal Committee, Guo Feng, during his participation in the democratic life meeting of the new provincial committee and in his daily life, always paid attention to leading by example. He encouraged the new leadership to pass through the "checkpoints" of power, money, flattery, family, and children. He said: New cadres, due to their change in status, have more people offering advice, more people visiting and saying nice words, more people flattering, and more people giving gifts.

Guo Feng said that to handle these relationships, relying solely on personal cultivation is not enough. It is more important to place oneself under the supervision of the Party and the people.

　　新老交替话廉洁
    ——访中顾委委员郭峰
    本报记者  尹品端
    从领导岗位退下来后，谦称自己主要是“面向过去，回避现实（忙于整理回忆录）的郭峰同志，其实随时都在关注党的建设，关注新班子、新干部的工作和成长。
    在一次会议的间隙，记者访问了郭峰同志。当问到老同志从领导岗位退下来后，如何帮助新班子、新干部为政清廉时，郭峰同志说：党的十三大提出要从严治党，要清除党内的腐败分子和处置不合格党员，这无疑是正确的。但是，如果领导班子、领导干部的廉政建设搞得不好，即使开除八百万不合格的基层党员，也不能解决我们党的建设的根本问题。关键是领导。新班子、新干部清廉与否，是关系到党的成败的一个大问题。现在新班子的成员，年轻化、知识化、专业化方面是不错的，工作也能打开局面，但革命化相对显得差一些。主要表现在政治思想素质不高、马列主义理论水平低、党的基本知识少、党性锻炼不够。比如，有的新干部到一个新地方上任后，不是先考虑如何把工作搞好，而是急于“搭窝”，安排自己的“四梁八柱”，把同学、哥们拉进领导班子，认为只有这样才能“站得住脚”。有人将此名曰“组阁”，其实，这种哥们义气与组阁完全是两回事。有的追求享受，铺张浪费，吃喝送礼，坐车挑最好的，盖房、家具也都讲究“高档”，还有一些人热衷于出国捞洋货，甚至还有贪污受贿的。
    这些现象，数量虽然不多，但在各级领导班子中或多或少都有一些。对这些现象，我们退下来的老同志有责任搞好传、帮、带。传：传道授业，介绍正反两方面的经验；帮：帮助排忧解难，献计献策；带：带出一个好的作风来。
    郭峰同志在辽宁省委和沈阳市委两次班子大调整时，在参加省委新班子民主生活会期间，在平时的生活中，无不注意言传身教。他勉励新班子的同志要过好权力、金钱、捧场、家庭、子女等“关卡”。他说：新干部由于地位的变化，“出谋划策”的多了，串门说好话的多了，捧场的人多了，送礼的人多了。
    郭峰同志说，要想处理好这些关系，光靠个人修养不够，更重要的是把自己置于党和人民的监督之下。
