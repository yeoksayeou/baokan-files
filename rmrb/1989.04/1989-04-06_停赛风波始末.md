The long-lasting suspension of the men's team final match between the champions and runners-up of the 40th World Table Tennis Championships last night cast a shadow over the entire event. This rare incident immediately stirred up the table tennis world, with various parties discussing it heatedly.

The sequence of events is as follows: During the fourth game, the Chinese team had already lost the first three. In the third set, when the score was 5-8 in favor of Waldner, Jiang Jialiang started to serve. The ball brushed the net and went over. The referee judged that Jiang's serve was below the table surface, violating the rules, and awarded a point to Waldner. Jiang Jialiang immediately stopped the game. The reporter saw from the stands that he first went to the referee to appeal, apparently without success, then returned to the Chinese team's seats to say a few words. From a distance, it was clear that the Chinese team sympathized with Jiang Jialiang. Li Furen stood up and left his seat to talk to someone outside the court. Jiang Jialiang also went to the Swedish team's coach, Oster, and gestured with his hands. Then he returned to the Chinese team's seats, crossed his arms, and leaned against the barrier, waiting for the decision. The reporter learned that he believed the referee was unfair and demanded a change of referee, otherwise he would not continue to participate. Li Furen believed that the Chinese athletes had received unfair treatment from the referee. He requested that the International Table Tennis Federation intervene.

The atmosphere on the court suddenly became tense. The technical committee immediately gathered in a corner of the barrier for an emergency discussion. The audience was in an uproar, emotions running high, and boos echoed through the arena, clearly expressing dissatisfaction with Jiang Jialiang. The originally calm and neutral West German audience suddenly sided with the Swedish team. After a while, in the midst of the chaotic arena, the loudspeaker announced the decision of the technical committee: "The International Table Tennis Federation Technical Committee and the chief referee decided: to uphold the referee's decision, but to replace the referee for this match to ensure the game proceeds smoothly." The West German referee, Egler, stood up and left his seat, and another West German referee, Braun, took over. The game resumed. The audience's emotions were even more heated, and they applauded loudly for every good shot by the Swedish team.

Regarding this unexpected event, the chairman of the International Table Tennis Federation Technical Committee, Malaysia's Yap Yew Hock, said: "I didn't see the ball clearly, but I think we should respect the referee's opinion. Changing the referee was just to ensure the game could continue." The Swedish team's coach, Oster, said at the post-match press conference: "Jiang Jialiang's attitude is unacceptable. His intention was clearly to disrupt Waldner's good competitive state, as Waldner was playing very well at that time. The referee should not have been changed."

　　停赛风波始末
    昨天晚上的第４０届世乒赛男子团体冠亚军决赛中发生的长达十几分钟的比赛中断事件，给这次世乒赛罩上一层阴影。这件罕见的事情立即引起乒乓球界轰动，各方人士议论纷纷。
    事情经过如下：比赛进行到第四盘，中国队已输掉前３盘。第３局打到５∶８，形势有利于瓦尔德内尔。江嘉良开始发球，球擦网而过，裁判认为江这个球发出时低于台面违例，判给瓦尔德内尔１分。江嘉良随即停止了比赛。记者从看台上看见他先到裁判面前申诉，显然交涉未成，又回到中国队坐处讲了几句。从远处看，中国队方面显然同情江嘉良，李富荣起身离座，走到场外与人交谈。江嘉良还走到瑞典队教练奥斯特面前，比着手势。然后他回到中国队坐处，抱着双臂，倚在档板上等候裁决。记者了解到，原来是他认为裁判不公，要求更换裁判，否则就不再参赛。李富荣认为，中国运动员受到了裁判的不公正待遇。他要求国际乒联进行干涉。
    场上气氛陡然紧张起来，技术委员会立即聚在档板的一角紧急磋商。观众大哗，情绪激动，嘘声震耳，明显对江嘉良表示不满。本来是冷静、中立的西德观众一下子倒向瑞典队。过了一会儿，在一片喧嚣的赛场中，扩音器传出技术委员会的裁决：“国际乒联技术委员会和总裁判决定：维持裁判员的裁决，但是为了使比赛不受影响，决定更换本场裁判。”西德裁判埃格勒起身离座，另一西德裁判布劳恩接任，比赛重新开始。观众这时情绪更加激动，对瑞典队的每一个好球都报以雷鸣般的掌声。
    对这次意外事件，国际乒联技术委员会主席、马来西亚的叶荣誉说：“我没有看清这个球，但我认为要尊重裁判意见。更换裁判只是为了使比赛继续下去。”瑞典队教练奥斯特在赛后的记者招待会上说：“江嘉良的态度是不能原谅的。他的目的无非是干扰瓦尔德内尔的良好竞技状态，因为瓦尔德内尔当时正打得非常出色。裁判员不应当更换。”
