On March 4th, your newspaper published a letter from a reader titled "Military Camp Turned into a Market" along with a photograph, which drew the attention of the Shangqiu Prefecture. The leaders of the prefecture, along with relevant departments in the city, visited the military units. It was decided that the Shangqiu City Government would take the lead, and the City Commerce Bureau, City Planning Bureau, Public Security Bureau, and other relevant departments would quickly clean up this market to ensure the safety of the camp area. Currently, the order at the entrance of our camp is well-maintained, and we no longer hear the vendors' cries. The Shangqiu Prefecture also studied and resolved more than ten specific issues related to the security, supply of materials, and arrangements for family members of the stationed troops.

　　商丘行署解决商贩扰军营问题
    ３月４日你报刊登了《军营竟成市场》的读者来信及照片后，引起了商丘地区行署的重视。行署领导同志带领地市有关单位走访了部队，决定由商丘市政府牵头，责成市工商局、城建局、公安局等有关部门迅速清理这个市场，保证营区安全。目前，我部营区门口秩序井然，再也听不到商贩的吆喝声了。商丘行署还研究解决了驻军营区治安、物资供应、家属随军安排等方面的１０多个具体问题。
