Li Fuhong, the deputy leader of the Chinese table tennis team, met with part of the Chinese media this afternoon at 3 PM to discuss the suspension that occurred during the men's team final between China and Sweden.

Li Fuhong said that disputes in any sporting event are inevitable and often occur, including disagreements over the fairness of referees. Thirty years ago, Uchikawa Ichiro was in Dortmund and there was an incident where the game was suspended for 40 minutes because of doubts about the referee's attitude. According to general international sports competition practices, the party that feels harmed by the referee's unfair attitude has the right to negotiate and protest, and the right to request relevant authorities to correct the referee's unfair attitude. Therefore, when Jiang Jialiang discovered that the West German referee was biased towards the Swedish team, raising this issue was in accordance with the regulations.

He said: "I believe the referee's attitude was unfair. There are three reasons. First, when Jiang Jialiang was playing against Appelgren in the first set and the score was 6-8, Appelgren served a ball that touched the net. Jiang Jialiang raised his hand to indicate this, but the referee did not react. According to the rules, if the referee insists on his own judgment, the match should continue; if the athlete continues to raise his hand, the outcome of the match is the athlete's responsibility. However, when Appelgren also indicated that the ball touched the net, and the referee still did not correct it, this was clear evidence of bias towards the Swedish team. Appelgren then intentionally hit the ball out of bounds in his next serve to show that the previous point was incorrect. In this regard, Appelgren's style was quite good. Second, the issue of wiping sweat. According to the convention, both sides can wipe sweat when changing serves, and after a tie at 20-20, they can wipe sweat in the event of a tie. However, the Swedish player wiped sweat when it was not a tie, and the referee allowed it; but when Jiang Jialiang wiped sweat, the referee drove him back. Third, the issue of whether the serve was a violation. Saying that Jiang Jialiang's serving hand was below the table is difficult to have a clear standard, and such a judgment is rarely seen in major international competitions. Therefore, I believe that the referee, when Jiang Jialiang and the Chinese team were already in a very difficult situation, made this decision in the fourth set and third game, clearly 'adding insult to injury.'"

He added, "The three referees for the men's team final between China and Sweden were all from West Germany, which is abnormal. 'Why not invite referees from other nationalities and other continents, but all from Europe?'"

He said, "In any sporting event, disputes are inevitable and often occur, including disagreements over the fairness of referees. Thirty years ago, Uchikawa Ichiro was in Dortmund and there was an incident where the game was suspended for 40 minutes because of doubts about the referee's attitude. According to general international sports competition practices, the party that feels harmed by the referee's unfair attitude has the right to negotiate and protest, and the right to request relevant authorities to correct the referee's unfair attitude. Therefore, when Jiang Jialiang discovered that the West German referee was biased towards the Swedish team, raising this issue was in accordance with the regulations."

### 李富荣谈江嘉良停赛原委

　　李富荣谈江嘉良停赛原委
    本报多特蒙德４月６日电  记者江建国、刘小明报道：中国乒乓球代表团副团长李富荣今天下午１５时约见部分中国记者，就中瑞两队在男子团体决赛中出现的停赛发表谈话。
    李富荣说，在任何体育比赛中出现纠纷是不可避免的，也是经常发生的，包括对裁判的态度是否公正无私的争议。３０年前荻村伊智朗也是在多特蒙德，曾发生过停赛长达４０分钟的事件，当时也是因为对裁判态度有怀疑。按照国际体育比赛一般惯例，感觉到受到裁判不公正态度损害的一方有权利提出交涉和抗议，有权利要求有关负责人纠正裁判的不公正态度。因此，当江嘉良发现西德籍裁判态度偏袒瑞典队时，提出这一问题，是符合规定的。
    他说：“我认为裁判态度是不公正的。理由有３条。第一，江嘉良在第一盘对阿佩伊伦的第一局比分为６∶８的时候，阿佩伊伦发了一个擦网球，江嘉良举手示意，裁判没有反应。按照规定，如裁判坚持己见，比赛应当继续进行；如运动员继续举手，比赛结局由运动员自负。但是，当阿佩伊伦也表示这个球擦网时，而裁判依然不作纠正，这是偏袒瑞典队的明显证据。阿佩伊伦于是在下一次发球时，故意将球击出界外，以示刚才因此得分不对。这一点上，阿佩伊伦的风格是不错的。第二擦汗问题。按惯例，换发球时双方可以擦汗，打到２０平以后，出现平局可以擦汗。但是，瑞典队员在非平局去擦汗，裁判听之任之；而江嘉良擦汗，裁判就把他轰回去。第三发球是否违例问题。说江嘉良发球手低于台面，很难有明确标准，在国际重大比赛中这样判很少见。因此，我认为裁判在江嘉良及中国队比赛已经十分困难时，在第４盘第３局作这个判决，明显是‘落井下石’。”
    他又说，中瑞男子团体决赛３个裁判都是西德人，这是不正常的。“为什么不请其他国籍、其他大洲的裁判，而是清一色欧洲裁判呢？”
