After taking office, what have I done for the people? On April 24, at the Beijing Municipal People's Congress press conference, Zhang Ming, a reporter from the *Beijing Evening News*, asked an unexpected question to several mayors attending the press conference.

"A year ago, during the election, several deputy mayors took the stage to speak, including their plans after taking office," the female reporter recalled vividly. "A year later, today, I would like to ask the deputy mayors present to list one thing each that they have done for the citizens without regret, and they can also share their governance experiences. I also hope that Mayor Chen Xitong can meet our request."

The venue immediately became lively.

Chen Xitong and the other deputy mayors smiled.

"This is indeed an interesting topic," Chen Xitong said, pushing the microphone to Zhang Jianmin on his right. "Yes, what about the promises? You go first!" Zhang Jianmin passed the microphone back to Chen Xitong. "Who should go first?"

After a round of laughter and applause, Chen Xitong said, "I am not newly elected, comrades can ask me too. I have been the mayor for 6 years, and I can say that I have just started to figure things out. My knowledge is limited, and being a mayor is not an easy job. I speak from the heart, my shoulders are really burdened, and I am sincerely afraid of not being able to fulfill my duties as the mayor.

"This is indeed a serious issue. After working for a few years in Beijing, what changes have occurred? If Beijing is not well-governed, I will not be able to account for my actions as the mayor.

"How has this year been? Overall, I have seriously implemented the central government's policies, and also seriously tried to implement the resolutions made by the People's Congress. I have also listened to many demands and voices from the public. However, upon review, there are still many flaws and a large gap. Especially, I feel that many problems in the reform have not been resolved, and in our economically weak situation, there are still many things that cannot meet the public's wishes. I want to do more, but I always feel powerless, and this power is financial power."

The mayor spoke from traffic to old city reconstruction. He said, "I received a letter from a citizen saying, 'Mayor Chen, you have done a good job in building the northern part of the city, and everyone has seen it. You should also pay attention to the southern part of the city. You are the mayor of the entire city.' I read the letter and felt very sad. Indeed, if you go to some tall buildings in Chongwen and Xuanwu districts and look down, you will see a mess. Can you say these people have high demands? At least they need a place to live. But these can only be ultimately solved after the reform."

Zhang Jianmin took the microphone and said, "I have been a deputy mayor since 1984. Summarizing these years of work, I am conscientious and have not let down the people's trust. Of course, there are still many shortcomings and mistakes in the work, but I believe I can resolutely overcome them. The current government will change in 1992, and by then I will also reach the age limit. If there are any thoughts for the next step, it is to work hard in this period and try to leave as few difficulties as possible for the successor.

"What are my achievements in these 5 years? I feel that I have made the problems of Beijing clearer. Beijing faces ten major problems: population explosion, lack of funds, housing shortage, price increases, frequent power outages, municipal debts, environmental issues, poor services, increased subsidies, and lack of water sources." He believed that this government could not solve so many problems and could only strive within its capabilities.

Zhang Baifu's response was, as usual, full of humor: "I did what I said in the last election speech, and I feel that I have worked hard but with poor results. I wanted to do more, but I couldn't because there was no money. The few things I promised originally had good plans, but due to the reduction in construction scale, it seems that they cannot be realized. My promises also need to be adjusted. I am now focusing on making the Asian Games a success." He also talked about the difficulties of old city reconstruction due to lack of funds. But he was full of confidence and hoped for more supervision.

Wu Yi, who came from the enterprise to the position of managing the city's industry and foreign trade, had a lot to say: "This year has been tough for me. How to quickly get into the role on such a big stage? After a year of effort, I don't know if I have really gotten into the role, I just feel that I have taken a step forward. The burden on me is very heavy. The work has not been done well, but there is one thing I can say without regret, just like I said in the last expression, I am working with all my heart.......

"The last point is that I have had a preliminary taste of the bitterness, sweetness, and spiciness of local officials. Even so, I will continue to work as before."

Lu Yucheng did not evaluate his work, but his statement was thought-provoking: "I am in charge of science and technology and education, both of which are strategically important. It is precisely because of this status that it is more difficult to implement. In this year, I have used 80% of my energy to focus on education, which is worthwhile."

He Luli's experience was unique: "I came from the grassroots. This year, I can say that I have gone from swimming in a small stream to initially learning to swim in a relatively large river, feeling that the responsibility is greater than when I first took office. This year, I have not dared to relax or be lazy in the work I am in charge of, and I always feel like I am sitting on a volcano. Moreover, every time a piece of work is done, I have this feeling: without experience, it is difficult. However, working in this united and fighting collective, my body and mind are happy. Especially as a non-Communist Party member deputy mayor, I particularly feel that the Beijing Municipal Government is very good in implementing cooperation between the Party and non-Party members. If I talk about the work I should focus on in the next few years, I think I should focus on doing a good job in Beijing's family planning and population work. If you ask about my feelings in this year, I say that I feel tired in both physical and mental aspects, but I am full of confidence."

After hearing the impromptu responses from these mayors, the reporters gave them a warm round of applause!

### 我在这一年……

　　我在这一年……
    本报记者  颜世贵
    执政后，我为人民做了什么？４月２４日在北京市人代会的记者招待会上，《北京晚报》记者张明非，向出席记者招待会的几位市长提了一个意想不到的问题。
    “一年前换届选举时，诸位副市长曾登台发表演说，内容包括执政以后的打算。”这位女记者记忆犹新，“一年后的今天，我想请在座的副市长，列举一下，每个人所做的一件无愧于良心和职责的为市民的事，讲执政感受也可以。另外，我也要求陈希同市长也能满足我们这个要求。”
    会场上一下活跃起来。
    陈希同和其他几位副市长笑了。
    “这可是个有意思的话题。”陈希同将话筒推给坐在他右边的张健民，“是啊，许诺了怎么样？你先讲吧！”张健民将话筒又送回到陈希同面前：“你们说谁先讲？”
    一阵笑声和掌声过后，陈希同说：“我不是新当选的，同志们要我说也可以。当了６年市长，可以说我刚刚摸出点门道。我的知识有限，当市长啊，也不是那么轻松的一件事。我说点心里话，我的肩膀实在是压得够沉的，怀着诚惶诚恐的心情来当这个市长的。
    “这确实是个严肃问题，干了几年北京市有些什么变化？北京搞不好，我这个市长不好交待。
    “今年干得怎么样？总的说，我还是认真的贯彻了中央的方针，同时也认真的努力去贯彻人民代表大会所作出的决议，也听取了许多群众提出的要求和呼声。但是，检查起来，毛病还不少，差距还很大。特别是，我感觉到在改革中遇到的许多问题未理顺，在我们的经济实力薄弱的情况下，还有很多事情不能满足群众的愿望，想多干点事，总觉得力不从心，这个力就是财力。”
    这位市长从交通讲到了旧城改造，他说：“我接到一封群众来信，说陈市长你把北城建设得好，大家都已看到，应该关心关心我们南城了，你是全城的市长。我看了来信，心里很难受。确实，你们到崇文、宣武区一些高楼上去看看，下面一片破烂。你能说这些人要求高吗？起码的条件，有个窝。但这些只有靠改革以后，才能最终解决。”
    张健民接过话筒说：“我从１９８４年担任副市长工作，总结这几年的工作，我问心无愧，没有辜负人民的信任，在勤勤恳恳工作。当然工作当中缺点和失误还是不少的，但我相信我能够坚决的来加以克服的。本届政府１９９２年就换届了，那时我年龄也到了。如果说下一步有什么想法，那就是这一段要努力工作，尽量少给接任人遗留困难。
    “这５年我的政绩何在？我觉得是把北京市的问题撕罗得比较清楚了。北京市面临的问题是十大方面：人口膨胀，资金短缺，住房紧张，物价上涨，经常停电，市政欠帐，环境待治，服务较差，补贴剧增，水无来源。”他认为，这届政府解决不了这么多问题，只能在力所能及的范围内，尽量去奋斗。
    张百发的回答，照例富有幽默感：“我是按上届选举演讲时说的那么干的，自我感觉辛辛苦苦，效益不佳。欲干不能，因为没有钱。我原来保证的那几件事，规划挺好，由于压缩基建规模，看来都实现不了了。我的保证也需要调整。我现在集中精力把亚运会搞好。”他也讲到了旧城改造，财力不济的难处。但他充满信心，希望大家多多监督。
    吴仪是从企业走上主管全市工业和外经外贸岗位的，她的感受颇多：“这一年来，工作对我来讲是艰辛的。站在这么一个大舞台，怎么尽快地进入角色？经过这一年的努力，我不知道我是否真正进入，我只是感到我迈进了门槛。我身上的担子是很重的。工作未做好，但是有一点我问心无愧，就像我在上次表态时讲的，我是在全身心地工作。……
    “最后一点，使我初步品尝到地方官员的酸、甜、苦、辣。即使如此，我还将一如既往地工作。”
    陆宇澄没有评价自己的工作，他的表白却耐人寻味：“我分管科技和教育，都是具有战略地位的工作。正是由于有这种地位，落实时就比较困难。我在这一年当中，用了８０％的精力去抓教育，是值得的。”
    何鲁丽的体会是独特的：“我是从基层来的，这一年可以说，从在小溪里游泳到初步学会在一个比较大的江河里游泳，感到比刚上任时的责任更大。这一年，我对自己分管的工作丝毫不敢放松，也不敢怠慢，时时觉得坐在一个火山口上。而且，每办成一件事，都有这样感觉：是非经过不知难。但是，在这个团结战斗的集体里工作，身心是愉快的。尤其作为一个非共产党员的副市长，我特别体会到北京市政府在实行党与非党合作方面是非常好的。如果讲今后几年我在任上应该抓的工作，我想重点把北京市的计划生育人口工作做好。要问我在这一年的感受，我说在体力上脑力上都感到辛苦，但是我充满信心。”
    听了这几位市长的即席回答，记者们报以热烈的掌声！
