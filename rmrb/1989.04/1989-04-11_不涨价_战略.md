The "No Price Increase" Strategy

Xinhua News Agency reporters Zhao Derun and Guo Xianwen

In September 1988, the Zhenping Flavor Factory in Henan, whose products won the gold medal at the first National Food Expo and the 12th Paris International Food Expo, publicly declared: Regardless of market changes, the factory's Lotus Brand MSG will not increase in price in 1989!

What does the Zhenping Flavor Factory intend to do? Is it a momentary impulse? Some competitors were puzzled.

However, factory director Li Huaiqing had his own plans:

Last August and September, the Zhenping Flavor Factory, based on market trends, conducted a forecast of the company's costs for 1989. The results showed that due to the rise in raw material and auxiliary material prices, increased bank interest rates, and other factors, the factory, which had already absorbed 73 million yuan in additional expenses in 1988, would face 120 million yuan in new technical renovation costs and cost expenditures in 1989.

120 million yuan is indeed a frightening figure. Li Huaiqing calculated several "potential" accounts at a mid-level cadre and worker representative meeting: In 1989, the existing production scale and matching equipment can increase production by 3,000 tons, adding 90 million yuan in profits; utilizing existing research results to improve process levels, promoting acid production rates, glucose conversion rates, and MSG yield rates, can add up to 50 million yuan in profits; extracting yeast from wastewater that was previously wasted and polluted the environment, which will start production in the second half of the year, can add 20 million yuan in benefits; for the technical renovation projects originally planned to be launched, changing from new construction projects to utilizing old factory buildings and old equipment, only adding key equipment, can save another 30 million yuan in expenses. Just these few items not only absorb the 120 million yuan in additional expenses but also increase value by more than 500 million yuan. There are various ways to calculate accounts. "Water rises, the boat rises" is a "small calculation," utilizing the "opportunity" of price increases to improve the enterprise's internal digestion capacity, using high quality and low prices to enhance reputation and increase competitiveness, is Li Huaiqing's "big account."

The potential has been found, but turning this potential into tangible benefits is not an easy task.

For this reason, at the beginning of the new year, the entire factory mobilized around the already formulated comprehensive potential-excavation and efficiency-increasing total target. The factory department, through scientific calculations and optimization plans, broke down the overall potential-excavation target into 6 specific guaranteed and contested indicators, which were layered down to each department, unit, and individual along 5 main lines of production, supply, sales, technical renovation, and ideological work. Each indicator was linked to the wages and bonuses of units and individuals based on the best benefit value.

Through efforts, by the end of February, the entire factory had completed a production volume of 1,430 tons, realized a profit and tax of 42.9 million yuan, and various indicators such as economic benefits, material consumption, product quality, and safe production were significantly better than the same period last year.

Li Huaiqing confidently introduced that if the current development momentum is maintained, by the end of this year, the entire factory, after absorbing the additional expenses, the economic benefits may be able to break through 300 million yuan, an increase of 20% over the same period last year.

The "No Price Increase" strategy has led the Zhenping Flavor Factory from a state of "mountains and waters covering" to "willows dark and flowers bright"; while some factories in the same industry with low technology, backward management, and relying on price increases to make a living have lost their competitiveness in the tightening market and begun to give up raw materials and withdraw from the market. For Li Huaiqing, this is exactly what he expected.

"Challenge is what all MSG factories face," Li Huaiqing said. "Whoever has stronger adaptability and digestion capacity, whoever has price advantages, will have raw materials and markets; otherwise, they will be squeezed out. Competition can promote the rational flow of raw materials, funds, and other resources, achieving optimal allocation, and thus creating favorable conditions for the state to adjust the industrial structure and product structure."

The "No Price Increase" strategy has greatly improved the factory's benefits. In the national MSG industry, generally speaking, for every additional ton of production, the average investment is 1 million yuan, while the Zhenping Flavor Factory's production scale has expanded from an annual output of 400 tons to 10,000 tons, using only 29 million yuan, which is 30% of the normal investment.

In the face of challenges and opportunities today, what lessons can many Chinese entrepreneurs learn from the Zhenping Flavor Factory's "No Price Increase" strategy?

### “不涨价”战略

　　“不涨价”战略
    新华社记者　赵德润　郭献文
    １９８８年９月，产品获全国首届食品博览会金奖和第１２届巴黎国际食品博览会金奖的河南周口味精厂，公开宣称：不管市场环境发生什么变化，当年到１９８９年内，该厂生产的莲花牌味精决不涨价！
    周口味精厂想干什么，一时头脑发热？一些同行对此迷惑不解。
    然而，味精厂厂长李怀清自有打算：
    去年８、９月间，周口味精厂根据市场变化的趋势，对１９８９年企业成本进行了一次预测。预测结果，由于原辅材料价格上涨，银行利率提高等因素，该厂在１９８８年消化７３０万元增支因素的基础上，１９８９年新增技术改造费用和成本支出将达到１２００万元。
    １２００万，确实是个吓人的数字，李怀清在中层干部和职工代表大会上算了几笔“潜力”帐：１９８９年，已有的生产规模配套，可以增加产量３０００吨，增利９００万元；运用现有科研成果提高工艺水平，促使产酸率、米糖转化率和味精收得率提高，加起来可增利５００万元；从白白流掉又污染环境的废水中提取酵母，下半年投产后可增加效益２００万元；为技术改造原定上马的新基建项目，改为利用旧厂房、老旧设备，只添置关键设备，一下子又可以节省开支３００万元。仅此几项，不仅把１２００万元增支因素消化掉，还将增值５００万元以上。账有各种算法。“水涨船高”是打的“小算盘”，利用涨价“机会”，提高企业内部消化能力，以优质低价提高信誉，增加竞争力，是李怀清的“大账”。
    潜力找出来了，但真要把潜力变成实实在在的效益，并不是件轻而易举的事。
    为此，新年伊始，全厂就围绕已经制定的全面挖潜增效总目标进行了动员。厂部经过科学的测算和优化方案，把总的挖潜目标化解为６项具体的保证和争取指标，按生产、供应、销售、技术改造、思想工作５条主线层层下达落实到每个部门、单位和个人。每项指标都按最佳效益值含量与单位和个人的工资奖金挂钩。
    经过努力，截至２月底，全厂已完成产量１４３０吨，实现利税４２９万元，经济效益、物质消耗、产品质量和安全生产等各项指标都明显好于去年同期。
    李怀清充满信心地介绍说，如果保持目前这样的发展势头，到今年底，全厂在消化增支因素之后，经济效益将有可能突破３０００万元，比去年同期增长２０％。
    “不涨价”战略，使周口味精厂从山重水覆走向柳暗花明；而同行业中一些技术低下、管理落后、靠涨价度日的厂家却在紧缩中丧失竞争能力，开始让出原料，退出市场。对李怀清来说，这正是意料之中的事。
    “挑战是所有味精厂家共同面临的。”李怀清说：“谁的应变能力和消化能力强，谁有价格优势，谁就有原料和市场，否则就将被挤出去。竞争，才能促使原料、资金等合理流动，达到优化配置，进而为国家调整产业结构和产品结构创造有利条件。”
    “不涨价”战略使该厂效益大为提高。在全国味精行业，一般说来产量每上１吨，平均投资１万元，而周口味精厂生产规模从年产４００吨扩大到１万吨却只用２９００万元，占正常投资的３０％。
    在挑战与机遇同时存在的今天，众多的中国企业家们，该从周口味精厂的“不涨价”战略中得到什么启示呢？
