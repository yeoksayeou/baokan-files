The White Head Plateau stretches across the two provinces of Chagang and Ryanggang in North Korea. It begins at the Yalu and Tumen Rivers on the China-North Korea border in the north and extends south to Chollima Ridge. To the east, it connects with the Maesan Mountain Range, and to the west, it borders the Kaehwa Plateau, covering an area of over 10,000 square kilometers, which is about 6% of North Korea's total land area. Upon our arrival, we witnessed a bustling scene of construction and development.

Before liberation, this region was one of the poorest and most backward in North Korea, with not a single high school in the entire area. After liberation, the rich mineral resources of the plateau transformed it into one of the country's major bases for non-ferrous metal production. There are six state-level copper mines alone, with an annual output accounting for about half of the country's total production, leading all provinces. The vast forests provide the state with 10 million cubic meters of high-quality timber annually. The provincial capital, Hyesan, has replaced its former low-rise huts with towering buildings. The province has established over 700 schools of all levels, including nine colleges and universities. Every county has its own hospital and cultural center. Tall television relay towers broadcast Pyongyang's television programs to the remote mountain villages.

Driving north along the winding mountain road on the North Korean side of the Yalu River, we saw forests stretching as far as the eye could see. The forest coverage rate is about two-thirds of the entire plateau. To protect and develop this valuable resource, the forestry departments have adopted the "cyclic logging" method and launched a mass campaign of "planting ten trees for every one cut down." In the area near Daehongdan County, on land that was logged 30 years ago, the artificially planted pine forests are now beginning to mature. In terms of comprehensive timber utilization, Ryanggang Province can produce dozens of products, including alcohol, fragrances, composite boards, and paper.

In Hyesan, Samhung Valley, and Onchun, our enthusiastic hosts treated us to a refreshing, tangy-sweet, purple-red fruit juice. Upon inquiring, we learned that it was a newly developed product—black bean fruit juice. The black bean fruit, scientifically known as "dragon lily," is a fast-growing wild plant. Its ripe fruits are purple-black in color. Every autumn, they can be seen growing in clusters along the edges of fields and on wild hillsides. For many years, only children would occasionally pick a few to eat. In recent years, researchers have discovered through repeated studies that it can not only be made into high-grade beverages but also has anti-cancer properties. Thus, fruit juice and fruit wine made from black bean fruit have been produced and have already entered the market in the capital, Pyongyang.

We drove through the vast forest to the heart of the plateau—the No. 5 State Farm. The average elevation here is around 1,000 meters, with soil mostly composed of volcanic ash. The average annual temperature is only 2.7°C, and the frost-free period is 100 days. In 1952, during the Korean War, a reclamation team from the interior established the first state farm in North Korea. After over 30 years of hard work, the farm has become a model of agricultural mechanization nationwide, with each agricultural worker cultivating an average of 30 jeongbo (one jeongbo is equivalent to 15 mu) of land. To combat the cold and wind, they have planted a total of 2,500 li of windbreaks. The farm manager, Pak Kun-su, told us that last year's total output value was 40 million won. The yield per jeongbo was 2.5 tons for barley, 3.1 tons for wheat, and 20 tons for potatoes. The income of farm workers is linked to the harvest. Last year, the farm exceeded its production plan by 120%, and the average monthly income of farm workers increased from over 90 won to over 130 won.

The farm has also established furniture factories, leather factories, paper mills, pharmaceutical plants, food processing plants, and brick factories, with their income accounting for one-third of the farm's total revenue. People told the reporter that the best Yongseong beer in North Korea is made from barley provided by them, and the potato starch used in cold noodle restaurants across the country, including the famous Okryu Pavilion in Pyongyang, is also produced by them. This is what they are most proud of.

　　白头高原行
    本报记者　徐宝康
    白头高原纵贯朝鲜两江道，北起中朝边界的鸭绿江、图们江，南至千回岭，东连茂山山脉，西接盖马高原，方圆１万余平方公里，约占朝鲜国土面积的６％左右。我们来这里，看到的是一派热气腾腾的建设景象。
    据介绍，解放前，这里是朝鲜最贫穷落后的地区之一，全境连１所中学都没有，解放后，高原丰富的矿藏资源使这里成为全国有色金属生产基地之一，仅国家一级的铜矿就有６座，开采量约占全国产量的一半，居各道之首；大片的森林每年向国家提供１００万立方米的优质木材；作为道首府的惠山，林立的高楼取代了昔日低矮的草房；全道创办了７００多所各级学校，其中仅高等院校就有９所；每个郡都有了医院、文化会馆；高耸的电视转播塔把平壤的电视节目传送到边远的山乡。
    沿着鸭绿江朝鲜一侧的盘山公路向北行，森林一片连着一片。森林覆盖率约占整个高原的２／３。为保护开发这一宝贵资源，各林产事业所采取“巡环采伐”法，同时发群众开展“伐１棵，种１０棵”的植树造林运动。在大红丹郡附近，在３０年前被采伐过的大片土地上，人工种植的松树林如今已开始成材。在木材的综合利用上，两江道已经能够生产酒精、香料、合成板、纸张等几十种产品。
    在惠山、三池渊、温水坪等地，盛情的主人还请我们品尝了一种又酸又甜、清爽可口的紫红色的果汁。一打听，原来是最近开发的新产品——黑豆果汁。黑豆果，学名“龙葵”，是一种速生的野生植物，成熟的果子呈紫黑色。一到秋天，庄稼地旁、野山坡上，到处都能看到它成团成簇地生长着、多少年来，只有孩子们偶尔摘下几颗吃着玩。近年，科研人员经过反复研究，发现它不仅可以制成高级饮料，而且还具有防癌的功效。于是，以黑豆果为原料的果汁和果酒生产出来了，并且已打入首都平壤的市场。
    我们乘汽车穿过茫茫的林海，来到高原的腹地——５号国营农场。这里海拔平均１０００米左右，土质多是火山爆发后的山灰，年平均气温只有２．７℃，无霜期１００天。在朝鲜卫国战争未结束的１９５２年，来自内地的垦荒队伍在这里建了当时朝鲜的第一座国营农场。经过３０多年的艰苦创业，该农场已成为全国农业机械化的标兵，农业工人平均每人耕种３０町步（一町步相当于１５亩）土地。为战胜严寒和风沙，他们种植了总长为２５００里的防风林。总场场长朴根洙对我们说，去年总产值为朝币４０００万元，大麦每町步产２．５吨，小麦每町步产３．１吨，土喜每町步产２０吨。收成的好坏与个人收入挂钩，去年农场超额完成生产计划１２０％，农工的平均月收入由原来的９０多元增加到１３０多元。
    农场还兴办了家具厂、皮革厂、造纸厂、制药厂、食品厂、砖瓦厂等，其收入占全场总收入的１／３。人们告诉记者，朝鲜最好的龙城牌啤酒的原料大麦是由他们提供的，全国各地的冷面馆，包括平壤最有名的玉流馆，都是他们精制的土豆淀粉作原料。这是他们最引为自豪的事情。
