A typical case of law enforcement officials abusing their power and extorting money has been exposed in Anxi County, Fujian Province. During the process of handling exit procedures, Chen Zhaowang, the county's political and legal affairs secretary, and Huang Lianjie and Wang Zhenmao, both deputy directors of the county's Public Security Bureau, were expelled from the Party and arrested by law.

From 1982 to 1987, a farmer in Anxi County repeatedly applied for his family to settle in Hong Kong. To gain approval, he gave "red envelopes" containing hundreds of yuan to Chen Zhaowang, who was then the director of the county's Public Security Bureau. Chen accepted the money but said it was "difficult to handle." It was not until the "red envelope" reached 1,000 yuan that Chen, after accepting two "four-digit" red envelopes, agreed to "study and resolve" the issue. Huang Lianjie, the deputy director of the Public Security Bureau, remained silent when receiving "three-digit" red envelopes, only agreeing to "help resolve" the issue after the amount doubled to "four digits." By the time the six members of the farmer's family had completed their procedures to go to Hong Kong in four batches, Chen Zhaowang and others had extorted over 20,000 yuan.

In this money-for-power transaction, a deputy prosecutor from the Anxi County Procuratorate acted as a "go-between," while a township judicial officer and a women's federation director ran errands, seeking small favors in return. They were given disciplinary actions of being placed on probation within the Party for two years, one year, and a serious warning within the Party, respectively.

The exposure of this case was due to public reports.

### 弄权勒索　执法犯法　福建３名公安干部被捕

　　弄权勒索　执法犯法
　　福建３名公安干部被捕
    本报福州４月１６日电　记者张铭清报道：一起典型的执法干部弄权勒索的案件，在福建省安溪县被揭露出来。在办理出境手续过程中，接受贿赂的安溪县委政法书记陈朝旺、县公安局副局长黄连捷、王振茂等被开除出党，依法逮捕。
    从１９８２年至１９８７年，安溪县一位农民多次申请一家人赴香港定居。为了获准，多次向当时身为县公安局长的陈朝旺送数百元一个的“红包”，陈一边接受，一边表示“难办”。直到一个“红包”金额达到１０００元的标准，陈在接受了二次“四位数”的“红包”后才表示“研究解决”。县公安局副局长黄连捷则在接受“三位数”标准的“红包”时不动声色，直到“红包”金额翻番为“四位数”时才表态“帮助解决”。当这个农民家的６个人分４批办妥赴港手续时，陈朝旺等人受贿累计已达２万多元。
    在这笔钱权交易中，安溪县检察院一个副检察长竟为当事人“穿针引线”，一个乡司法干部和妇联主任为之上下奔波，以从中捞取小惠。他们也分别受到留党察看两年、一年和党内严重警告处分。
    此案的揭露得力于群众举报。
