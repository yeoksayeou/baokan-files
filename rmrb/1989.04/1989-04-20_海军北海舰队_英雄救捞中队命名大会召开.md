The naming ceremony for the Central Military Commission's conferral of the "Heroic Salvage Unit" honorific title to the North Sea Fleet's Firefighting and Salvage Unit was held here. Admiral Li Yaowen, the political commissar of the Navy, presented the flag to the unit.

The North Sea Fleet's Firefighting and Salvage Unit is a maritime rescue team that, over the past thirty years, has ensured the safety of military operations, national defense research, and supported local construction and the rescue of people's lives. They have excellently completed various tasks and are the first unit in the North Sea Fleet to be awarded an honorific title by the Central Military Commission.

Since 1980, this unit has rescued and salvaged 49 domestic and foreign ships in distress and executed over 100 rescue missions. They braved the rapid currents of the Tuojiang River to salvage China's scientific experimental satellite data capsule, risking being swept away by the torrent. They extinguished a raging fire on the "Xiangyanghong 09" scientific research vessel, facing the danger of exploding fuel tanks. They ventured into a pitch-black coal mine, risking asphyxiation and being buried, to rescue trapped miners. In critical moments, they often put the hope of survival in the hands of others.

　　海军北海舰队　英雄救捞中队    
    命名大会召开
    本报青岛四月二十日电  记者张砚报道：中央军委授予北海舰队防火机动救捞中队“英雄救捞中队”荣誉称号命名大会在这里举行，海军政委李耀文上将向这个中队授旗。
    北海舰队防火机动救捞中队是一支海上救生部队，三十多年来为保证部队作战训练、国防科研和支援地方建设、抢救人民群众的生命安全，出色完成了各项任务。它是北海舰队第一个被中央军委授予荣誉称号的先进集体。
    一九八○年来，这支中队救援打捞国内外遇险船只四十九艘，执行各项救生任务一百多次。他们在水流湍急的沱江冒着被急流卷走的危险，打捞我国科学试验卫星数据舱；他们在大火熊熊的“向阳红零九”号科学考察船上冒着燃油柜随时爆炸的危险，扑灭烈火；他们在漆黑一团的煤井，冒着被窒息和被埋的危险，救援遇难矿工。在生死关头，他们常把生的希望让给别人。
