Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, April 3rd.

	The West Lake of Guilin, which had been lost for nearly a century, has now been partially restored and opened to the public. During the Tang and Song dynasties, there was a saying that "there are sixty West Lakes in the world," with Guilin's West Lake being one of the largest, covering approximately 700 mu (about 46.7 hectares). However, since the Yuan Dynasty, local landlords destroyed the lake and sold the land, causing Guilin's West Lake to exist in name only. In 1987, the Guilin Municipal Government allocated over 10 million yuan to rebuild the West Lake. The restored West Lake now has a surface area of 72 mu (about 4.8 hectares), with clear water. The lake features curved bridges and arched bridges connecting Yinshan and Xishan.

　　消失百年　胜景重现
    桂林西湖修复开放
    新华社南宁４月３日电  （通讯员陆仁基、李灼）消失了数百年的桂林西湖现已初步修复，向游人开放。唐宋时期曾有“天下西湖达六十”的说法，桂林西湖是当时其中最大的一个，湖面约有７００亩。但从元朝以来，当地豪绅毁湖卖田，使桂林西湖名存实亡。１９８７年，桂林市人民政府拨款１００多万元，重建桂林西湖。目前重现的桂林西湖有７２亩湖面，湖水清澈。湖中筑有曲桥、跳桥，连接着隐山和西山。
