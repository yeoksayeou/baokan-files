The noisy crowd has dispersed, and the smashed cars have been towed away, but the ten or so shops and stalls that were looted remain in a state of desolation and ruin. The night of April 22nd left a deep wound in the hearts of Changsha's people.

During this weekend, a total of 38 shops and stalls were ravaged, with preliminary estimates of economic losses exceeding 800,000 yuan.

This is the most serious incident since Changsha's peaceful liberation. Reporters rushed to the scene to witness the entire process of this disaster.

On the morning of April 22nd, over 4,000 students from Changsha's universities, carrying banners that read "Mourn the Passing of Comrade Hu Yaobang" and holding wreaths, marched through the city streets, chanting slogans. By evening, most of the students had left, but tens of thousands of people still gathered on the wide Five-One Avenue. Some were discussing the day's events, most were out for the weekend or to watch the spectacle, and a few were looking to cause trouble. Reporters squeezed through the crowd and saw some stylishly dressed young men with trendy haircuts strutting down the street, shouting and making a ruckus. Some kicked closed shop doors, while others punched and kicked onlookers, who quickly moved away. However, some people still followed along, cheering them on.

Near the center of Five-One Square, thousands of people had gathered. Some started jeering as cars passed by, shouting "Hoo, hoo" and swarming towards them. Individual minibus drivers were forced to kneel and beg for mercy, while others sped away. Seeing a police officer on duty in the traffic booth at the center of the square, the crowd attacked him. Some pulled at his clothes, others snatched his hat, and still, others smashed the booth's windows.

Soon, reporters saw near Five-One Square that five or six young men blocked a small car and jumped onto its roof, stomping wildly. The onlookers immediately joined in, shouting "One, two, three, go!" Reporters pushed through the crowd to see these individuals jumping wildly on the car, shouting and screaming. One burly man suddenly jumped off the car, picked up a long, thick tree branch from the ground, and swung it wildly at the onlookers. People quickly backed away, the branch nearly hitting the reporter. Someone shouted, "The police are coming!" The group scattered, but after a while, seeing no police, they regrouped and continued their chaos. Another group surrounded a large truck, jumping on and off, screaming wildly; they also chased after tricycles. Later, a black Volga sedan was finally overturned and smashed, and two cars were stolen.

The New Hua Lou noodle shop on Five-One Road, which had been awarded multiple times for its service quality, was the first to be attacked. A mob rushed in, smashing tables, chairs, and counters on the first floor, shouting, "Advanced shop, must be smashed!" They stole three wooden boxes of money, but a female employee fought back and retrieved one, her arm injured in the struggle.

After the attack on New Hua Lou, the crowd shouted, "Smash everything!" and rushed to the opposite New Yan Carpet Store. From 9 PM to 10 PM, this store was looted twice.

Meanwhile, a nearby optical shop suffered even greater damage. Reporters saw a group of people rush into the store, shouting and smashing doors, windows, and counters, looting items. Some grabbed packs of high-end lenses, stuffing them into their pockets, and when they couldn't fit more, they threw them into the crowd like flyers.

Around 9:30 PM, in front of the Butterfly Building on Five-One Road, a large crowd had gathered, with women's screams of "Help!" occasionally heard. Pushing through the crowd, reporters saw a young woman fallen to the ground, with three or four men surrounding her, making lewd remarks and assaulting her. The woman struggled to stand but was pushed down repeatedly. Just as she was in dire straits, the tightly packed crowd suddenly parted, and three sturdy men pushed through, helping the woman up and carrying her over the iron railing to safety in the Butterfly Building. Reporters later learned that the woman was a student from the Foreign Languages Department of Hunan Normal University, and her rescuers were police officers Zhang Mingfang, Peng Jianlong, and Zhang Ning from the Changsha Public Security Bureau.

Looting also occurred on the bustling commercial street of Huangxing Road. This street, less than 2 kilometers long, had four shops looted, including the Swan Store of Changsha Rubber Shoe Factory, and the rest were individual shops.

At midnight, Changsha Railway Station was also looted by criminals.

In the early hours of April 23rd, teams of public security officers and armed police were dispatched to the scene. Near the bank entrance at Five-One Square, a criminal attempting to commit a crime was caught by two police officers. A surging crowd quickly gathered, with some taking advantage of the chaos. A few other police officers quickly stepped forward, shouting, "Who dares to come!" The instigators retreated in fear but followed the police to the Public Security Bureau's entrance on Huangxing Road, attempting to break in. Several public security personnel shouted warnings and fired shots, causing the crowd to retreat.

On the crowded streets, we heard various comments. Some citizens said, "These hooligans and bandits are taking advantage of the chaos to make illicit gains. How can they not be severely punished!" Many people said that such incidents had never occurred since the founding of the nation, and that those who commit crimes should be severely punished. Several students from the Foreign Languages Department of Hunan Normal University told reporters that after the looting incident, students were very angry and there are lessons to be learned. Our actions should avoid being used by those with ulterior motives in society. Students from Central South Industrial University, Hunan University, and other schools also demanded that the government crack down on social disorder and criminal activities.

After two days and nights of hard work, public security officers have initially identified among the nearly 100 arrested criminals, there are released prisoners, gang members, roaming criminals, and idle individuals from society. Among them, 58 were involved in looting, 24 in vandalism, and 16 took advantage of the chaos to steal. Currently, 52 have been detained, 5 administratively detained, 33 released after education, and 8 awaiting further investigation.

　　长沙街头打砸抢目击记
    新华社记者  曹光晖  张勇  刘春贤  刘非小
    喧闹的人群已经疏散，砸烂的汽车早已运走，可是十来个被洗劫一空的商店和柜台依旧是那副空空如也、破败不堪的惨状。２２日这个夜晚，给长沙人民心中留下一道深深的伤痕。
    就在这个周末，全市共有３８家商店、售货摊惨遭劫难，初步估算，造成经济损失８０万元以上。
    这是长沙和平解放以来没有发生过的严重事件。记者赶赴现场采访，目睹了这场劫难的全过程。
    ２２日上午，长沙市高校的４０００多名学生，打着“沉痛悼念胡耀邦同志”的横幅，抬着花圈，高呼口号，到市区游行。傍晚，游行的学生基本离去，宽阔的五一大道上，仍然聚集着成千上万的人。有的在议论白天游行的情况，多数是出来度周末和看热闹的人，少数人想趁机捣乱。记者在人缝中挤来挤去，只见一些衣着时髦、烫着流行发式的小青年，在街道上耀武扬威，大喊大叫，有的乱踢已经关闭大门的商店，有的对围观的群众挥拳踢脚，人们纷纷避开，但仍有一些人尾随起哄助威。
    在市中心五一广场附近，聚集着数千人。有些人见到汽车开过来就起哄，“嗬、嗬”地直喊，围上去就掀汽车，有的个体“中巴”司机被逼得下跪求饶，有的则驾车夺路而逃。这些人见广场中心的交通岗亭有一名警察在执勤，就围攻上去，有的扯他的衣服，有的抢他的帽子，有的砸烂岗亭的玻璃。
    不久，记者在五一广场附近见到，五六个小青年拦住一辆小轿车，并跳到车顶上使劲地跺脚。围观的人群马上起哄，连声高喊“一二三”，“加——油！”记者挤进人群细看，这几个人正发疯似地在车上狂跳，大喊大叫，其中一个体形粗壮的家伙，猛地从车上跳下来，捡起地上一根很长的碗口般粗的树枝，对着围观的人群乱扫。人们连连后退，枝条差一点扫着记者。这时有人高喊：“警察来啦！”这伙人马上一哄而散，过一会儿见没有警察，又围上去闹腾起来。另一群人则围住一辆大卡车，跳上跳下，狂呼乱叫；见到三轮车也追打不休。后来，有一辆黑色伏尔加轿车终于被掀翻砸烂，两辆汽车被抢劫开走。
    位于五一路的新华楼削面馆，曾多次被评为全国和省市服务质量先进企业，“店学新华楼”的口号在长沙广为人知。晚上８时半，这里首当其冲受到歹徒抢砸。一群人发疯似的冲进去，把一楼的桌椅、柜台砸烂，还叫嚣：“先进店子，就是要砸！”歹徒们抢走了３个装钱的木箱子，一名女职工奋力搏斗夺回来一个，她的手臂却被歹徒打伤。
    新华楼遭劫后，这群人高喊：“打地毯！”又冲向对面的新燕地毯商场。从晚上９点多到１０点多，这家商场先后两次被冲抢。
    与此同时，邻近的一家眼镜店遭受更大的劫难。记者目睹一伙人冲进店内，一边叫喊，一边大砸门窗、柜台，哄抢店内物品。有的人抓起一包包高级镜片，使劲往口袋里塞，塞不下就像撒传单一样，往围观的人群里扔。
    ９时半左右蝴蝶大厦前的五一路上，密匝匝地围着一大圈人，人群里不时传来女子呼喊“救命”的声音。挤进人群，只见一年轻女子跌倒在地，有三四个男子紧挨其身，口吐秽言，并动手动脚。这位女子几次挣扎起来，都被这伙人推倒。正在危难之际，围紧的人群突然松动，３位壮实的汉子排开人群冲进去，扶起那位女子，抱着她越过铁栏杆，跑到蝴蝶大厦保护起来。记者事后了解到，这女子是湖南师范大学外语系的学生，奋勇救她的是长沙市公安局的藏明芳、彭建龙、张宁３位干警。
    抢劫，也袭击了最繁华的老商业街黄兴路。这条不足２公里长的街道，有４家店子被抢空，其中除长沙橡胶皮鞋厂的天鹅商场外，都是个体商店。
    深夜１２时，长沙火车站也遭到不法分子的抢劫。
    ２３日凌晨，一队队公安干警和武警战士奉命出动，直奔出事现场。五一广场附近的银行门口，一名企图作案的不法分子，被两名警察当场抓获。潮水般的人群马上涌过来，少数人趁机起哄并围上去。另外几名警察赶忙站出来，大吼一声：“哪个敢来！”起哄的人吓得连连后退，但一直尾随到黄兴路上的公安局门口，有人试图冲进去。几名公安人员连声喝斥并鸣枪警告，这群人才退走。
    在人流如潮的街头，我们不断听到种种议论。有的市民说：“这伙流氓土匪趁火打劫，发不义之财，不严惩怎么得了！”很多人都说，这样的事件是建国以来未出现过的，对为非作歹的犯罪分子应予以严厉打击。湖南师范大学外语系几名学生对记者说，不法分子砸抢商店事件发生后，我们学生很气愤，也是有教训可以吸取的。我们的行动要避免为社会上那些别有用心的人所利用。中南工业大学、湖南大学等院校的学生还要求政府整顿社会治安，打击流氓犯罪。
    公安干警经过两天两夜的艰苦奋战，在已经抓获的近百名不法分子中，已初步查明，有劳改释放人员，有流氓团伙成员，有流窜犯罪分子，有社会上闲散人员等，其中进行抢劫的５８人，打砸东西的２４人，趁机捞一把的１６人。现已收审５２人，治安拘留５人，教育释放３３人，待审查的８人。
