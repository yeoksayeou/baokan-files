	Western experts have recently conducted important research on the issue of only children, proving that only children have many advantages. Compared to children from families with multiple children, only children receive better education, have higher IQs, and stronger social skills.

	For a long time, people have generally believed that the lack of siblings will make children overly self-centered. Western experts believe that this view has no scientific basis. Tony Falbo, a psychologist from the University of Texas, conducted hundreds of comparative studies and concluded that "only children have two notable characteristics: strong self-esteem and a strong drive for achievement." The simplest explanation for the advantages of only children is that they receive more parental love and better material conditions compared to children from families with multiple children. Additionally, since only children do not have companions at home, they have to go out and find friends, thereby developing their "diplomatic skills" from a young age.

	Only children spend more time alone, which also has its benefits. Pediatrician Kaplan, author of "Raising an Only Child," says: "Generally, only children are not good at blending in with groups, but once accepted by a group, they often exhibit leadership abilities."

	Because only children do not have fixed playmates, they have to rely on their imagination to enrich their world, thus igniting the spark of creativity. The author of "The Only Child Handbook," Slon, says: "Only children are better at exploring their own realms compared to other children."

### 西方专家谈  独生子女的好处

　　西方专家谈
    独生子女的好处
    最近美国一项关于独生子女问题的重要研究证明，独生子女有许多好处。与多子女家庭的孩子相比，独生子女受到的教育更好，智商更高，社交能力更强。
    长期以来，人们普遍认为，没有兄弟姐妹会使孩子过分以自我为中心。西方专家认为，这种观点毫无科学根据。美国得克萨斯州大学心理学家托尼·福尔波进行了数百项比较研究，认为“独生子女有两个显著特点，即自重和进取精神强”。独生子女的好处，最简单的解释，就是他们比多子女家庭的孩子能得到更多的父母之爱，物质条件也更好。此外，由于独生子女在家中没有伴，所以不得不外出找小朋友，为此从小就锻炼了他们的“外交才能”。
    独生子女更多的时间是独处，这亦有好处。著有《独生子女的养育》一书的儿科医师卡帕尔曼说：“一般情况下，独生子女不容易合群，但一旦被一团体所接受，往往能表现出领袖才能。”
    独生子女由于没有固定玩伴，只好靠想象来丰富自己的世界，从而点燃了创造之火。《独生子女手册》的作者斯朗说：“独生子女比其他孩子更善于开拓自己的天地。”
