The State Council's 39th Executive Meeting discussed and approved the "Interim Regulations on the Management of Foreign Chambers of Commerce," which aims to promote international trade and economic and technological exchanges, strengthen the management of foreign chambers of commerce, and safeguard their legal rights and interests. The meeting was presided over by Premier Li Peng and Vice Premier Yao Yilin.

The "Interim Regulations" consist of 14 articles, covering the nature and definition of foreign chambers of commerce; the conditions for establishing foreign chambers of commerce and their members; the procedures for reviewing and registering the establishment of foreign chambers of commerce; the activities and management of foreign chambers of commerce; the procedures for changing and dissolving foreign chambers of commerce; and penalties.

The "Interim Regulations" stipulate that foreign chambers of commerce are non-profit organizations established by foreign commercial entities and individuals in China, which do not engage in any commercial activities. Their activities should aim to promote trade and economic and technological cooperation between their members and China, providing convenience for their members in researching and discussing trade and economic and technological cooperation with China.

The regulations specify that foreign chambers of commerce should be established by country and can have both organizational and individual members. To establish a foreign chamber of commerce, an application must be submitted in writing through the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, which will then be reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade. The Ministry of Civil Affairs will handle the registration in accordance with relevant laws and regulations. If a foreign chamber of commerce violates the "Interim Regulations," the registration authority has the right to issue warnings, impose fines, order a temporary suspension of activities, revoke registration, or order the dissolution of the chamber.

Nine people attended today's executive meeting, and five were absent.
