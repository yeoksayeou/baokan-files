A large-scale horse meat processing plant, the largest of its kind in China, has recently begun construction in Dong Ujimqin Banner, Inner Mongolia.

Dong Ujimqin Banner is located deep within the Xilingol Grassland, known not only for its cattle and sheep but also as a major breeding ground for Mongolian horses and Ujimqin horses. To fully utilize the economic value of the grassland horse industry, the banner government has collaborated with relevant units within the autonomous region and beyond to raise 3.4 million yuan in funds. The construction of the large-scale horse meat processing plant has now commenced. Upon completion, the plant will be able to process over 6,000 fattened horses annually, producing approximately 1,000 tons of horse meat.

　　我兴建大型马肉加工厂
    据新华社呼和浩特４月１９日电　（记者石圭平）我国最大的一个马肉加工厂，最近在内蒙古东乌珠穆沁旗境内开始动工兴建。
    东乌珠穆沁旗位于锡林郭勒草原深处，不仅盛产牛羊，也是蒙古马和乌珠穆沁马的集中产地。为使草原养马业充分发挥其经济价值，旗政府同自治区内外有关单位进行横向联合，筹集资金３４０万元，开始兴建大型马肉加工厂。正式投产后，年加工育肥马６０００多匹，生产马肉１０００吨左右。
