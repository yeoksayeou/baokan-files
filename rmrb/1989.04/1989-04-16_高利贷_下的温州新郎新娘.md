In recent years, the extravagance of Wenzhou weddings has surpassed the imagination of ordinary people. When a young man gets engaged, he needs to give the girl's family gold necklaces, earrings, bracelets, and at least two gold rings, totaling at least 15,000 yuan. He also needs to give leather coats, wool sweaters, and wool yarn worth thousands of yuan. When getting married, besides giving the girl at least 5,000 yuan in cash, preparing a house, and a full set of furniture, he also needs to prepare another 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.

Currently, the trend of extravagance is escalating because the standards for home decoration are getting higher. In Wenzhou, young couples who want to decorate a decent home need at least 10,000 yuan.

The bride also has no easy task; she needs to be responsible for buying a full set of household appliances, such as color TVs, refrigerators, VCRs, and high-end stereo systems. She also needs to buy high-end bedding, cosmetics, various small decorations, and so on. Without 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, she cannot leave the house.

The enormous expenses for the bride and groom are basically the responsibility of their parents. Although Wenzhou people have money, they cannot afford such extravagance. Some young men from less affluent families have to bear the burden of usury. One young man borrowed 3,000 yuan at a monthly interest rate of 3% for his wedding, needing to pay 90 yuan in interest per month, while his basic salary is only 70 yuan.

The trend of competing in wedding extravagance is getting worse, and everyone feels helpless. Borrowing usury to get married is not an isolated phenomenon. As for how to repay the debt and how to live in the future, the young man who borrowed the money told me he hasn't thought about it yet.

　　“高利贷”下的
　　温州新郎新娘
    这些年，温州人结婚大操大办之风超出了常人的想象。小伙子订婚需给女方送金项链、金耳环、金手镯和至少两个金戒指，起码要１５０００元；还要送皮大衣、羊毛衫、毛线等，价值数千元。结婚时，小伙子除了要送给女方至少５０００元现金、准备房子及全套家具外，还得准备上两三万元。
    目前，操办之风又有进展，因为住房的装修标准越来越高。在温州，结婚青年要装修一套象样住房，最少要１万元。
    姑娘在结婚时同样没有轻松和超脱，要负责置办全套的室内设备，如彩电、冰箱、录相机及高级组合音响，全套床上用品、高级化妆品、各种小摆设等等。没有两三万元，走不出家门。
    新郎新娘的巨额开支，基本上是由家长负责的。虽然温州人有钱，但也经不起如此折腾。一些家庭条件不太好的小伙子，不得不背上高利贷的重负。有一位小伙子为结婚借了３０００元月利３分的高利贷，每月需付利息９０元，可他的基本工资只７０元。
    结婚攀比之风越演越烈，人人感到身不由己，借高利贷结婚，不是个别现象。至于今后如何还债，怎么生活，借贷的小伙子告诉我，还没细想过。
