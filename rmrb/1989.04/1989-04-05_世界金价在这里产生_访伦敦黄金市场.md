The London Gold Market is the world's largest gold market. However, you won't find it on any map of London. This is because, unlike a stock exchange with a specific trading floor and bustling crowds, the "London Gold Market" is a virtual market where five major gold dealers connect with clients around the world through an electronic network. Recently, a reporter visited the historic Mocatta Company, one of the five major gold dealers, located in the financial district of Curson Street.

The Gold Pyramid Trading Network

The "London Gold Market Association" was established in December 1987. The Bank of China's London branch is one of the founding members of this association. The five major gold dealers—Mocatta Company, Pixley Company, Rothschild Company, Mocatta Company, and Montague Company—are the decision-making members. Each of these firms has a history of over a hundred years. According to Mr. Peter Hambro, the managing director and chairman of the public affairs committee of the London Gold Market Association, the five major gold dealers hold a "pricing" meeting every working day. Rothschild chairs these meetings and oversets the gold trading. Company representatives connect with clients through the electronic network. These clients could be banks, large corporations, or other gold dealers, who in turn connect with numerous other small and medium-sized gold dealers, forming a pyramid-shaped trading network.

How Gold Prices Are Determined

"How does the trading take place? How is the gold price determined?" These are the questions I wanted to answer. Mr. Hambro, sensing my curiosity, showed me a recording of the pricing process.

At 10:30 AM (and again at 3:00 PM), representatives from the five major gold dealers gather in the elegant office of Rothschild in the financial district. The chairman, Rothschild, sits at one end of the polished conference table, while the other four representatives sit at desks on either side, each with a small Union Jack flag in front of them.

The meeting begins with Rothschild's representative, as chairman, announcing a gold price. The representatives immediately relay this price back to their respective trading rooms. The trading rooms then respond to customer inquiries about the price. Based on the received instructions, they notify their representatives whether to buy or sell and specify the quantity.

If, after the initial price announcement, there are no buyers or sellers, or if the quantities of buy and sell orders are imbalanced, the same procedure is repeated. Rothschild, as the chairman, adjusts the original price based on the supply and demand situation from all parties. The companies then react anew, until the buy and sell orders are balanced, and all five flags are lowered. The chairman then announces "pricing achieved." This price becomes the gold price for the day and is immediately sent out to the world.

The Standard Price for the World

When asked if the pricing by the five major gold dealers accurately reflects the supply and demand of the global gold market, Mr. Hambro proudly affirmed the process. According to him, the pricing procedure is simple and easy to understand. During the pricing period, both buyers and sellers can cancel their transactions at any time without incurring any obligations. Only the buyers pay a commission, while the sellers can negotiate to obtain a 0.055% profit, which is attractive to both investors and customers. Moreover, each company, through the trading network, extends its reach to almost every corner of the world.

In fact, since the first gold pricing held by the elder Rothschild on September 12, 1919, in London, the gold price of the London Gold Market has always been considered the standard price in the global gold market.

　　世界金价在这里产生
    ——访伦敦黄金市场
    本报记者  陈特安
    伦敦黄金市场是世界最大的黄金市场。但是，在伦敦地图上怎么也找不到它的地点，这是怎么回事呢？原来，它同有特定交易场地人群熙来攘往的“股票交易所”不同，“伦敦黄金市场”是由五家大金商通过电子网络与世界各地的客户联系在一起的一个隐形市场。不久前，记者前往金融城克鲁斯比广场访问了五大金商中历史最为悠久的莫卡塔公司。公司常务副董事、伦敦黄金市场协会公共事务委员会主席彼特·汉布罗热情地接待了记者。
    金字塔形的交易网
    “伦敦黄金市场协会”于１９８７年１２月成立，中国银行伦敦分行也是该协会的发起成员之一。五大金商莫卡塔公司、皮克斯利公司、罗斯柴尔德公司、马西公司和蒙塔古公司都是这个协会的决策成员。它们都是有百年以上历史的商号。据汉布罗先生介绍，五大金商每个工作日都举行“定价”会议。由罗斯柴尔德当主席，主持黄金交易。公司代表通过电子网络联系着客户，他们可能是某国银行、某大公司或其他金商，而这些银行、公司、金商又各自联系着许许多多的大中小金商，形成金字塔状的交易网络。
    黄金价格的产生
    “交易如何进行？金价如何定出？”这是我想解开的谜。主人汉布罗先生察觉出我的心思，给我放定价现场录相。
    上午１０点３０分（下午３点也有一次），五大金商的五位代表聚集在金融城罗斯柴尔德雅致的办公室。会议主席罗斯柴尔德坐在锃亮的会议桌的一端，其他四大金商的代表分坐在左右两旁的四张写字台前，桌前还树着一面小米字旗。
    会议开始时，通常由罗斯柴尔德公司的代表以主席身份先报一个金价，各代表立刻把开价报回各交易室。交易室依次回答顾客关于价格的询问。然后根据收到的指令，通知它们的代表宣布是买还是卖，并说明买多少或卖多少。
    如果开价后既没买的，也没卖的，或者买与卖的数额不平衡，同样的程序又开始，罗斯柴尔德以会议主席的身份，根据各方买卖的供需情况，对原报价适当调整，然后，各公司又有了新的反应，直到买与卖平衡了，五面小旗都放倒了，主席就宣布“达成定价”。它就成为当天的金价，并马上被发往世界各地。
    世界金价的标准价
    当记者问及五大金商定价能否准确反映世界黄金市场的供求关系时，汉布罗先生以自豪的口吻作了肯定的回答。据他分析，这样定价程序简单易懂，定价期间买卖双方又可随时取消业务而不负任何义务，只由买者付佣金而卖者通过讨价还价还可得到０．０５５％的利润，这对于投资者和顾客都有吸引力。同时，每个公司通过交易网络，把它们的触角几乎延伸到世界的各个角落。
    其实，自老罗斯柴尔德１９１９年９月１２日在伦敦举行第一次黄金定价以来，伦敦黄金市场的金价一直被公认为世界黄金市场上的标准价。（附图片）
