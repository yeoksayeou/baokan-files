	To welcome and successfully host the 11th Asian Games to be held in Beijing next year, 36 cultural and news organizations, including the Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Chinese Journalists Association, People's Daily, and Xinhua News Agency, have decided to launch an excellence awards program for outstanding artistic and news works related to the Asian Games.

	The awards program covers two main categories: artistic works, including reportage, essays, poetry, and folk art performances; and news reports, including news briefs, feature stories, columns, radio and television special programs, and commentaries. Works published, performed, or broadcast between April 1, 1989, and January 31, 1991, will be eligible for nomination in two phases: the first phase, ending on September 20, 1990, will focus on works that reflect the preparations for the Asian Games; the second phase, from September 20, 1990, to January 31, 1991, will cover works that reflect the actual Games.

	The Excellence Awards Committee for Artistic Works and the Excellence Awards Committee for News Works will be chaired by Cao Yu and Mu Qing, respectively. In February 1991, "Preparation Awards" and "Competition Awards" (each with first, second, and third prizes) will be announced. An awards ceremony will be held in March 1991. Daily operations for the awards program will be managed by the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Beijing Journalists Association. All cultural and news organizations are welcome to actively participate in this activity.

	This initiative has already received sponsorship and support from organizations such as the Beijing Light Industry Group and the Beijing Television Factory.
