Edition: 4

Recently, there has been a noticeable increase in the publication of materials related to sex. Currently, several issues exist in the publication of these books, mainly:

There are many repetitive titles. For example, in the field of sex education, there are books such as "Sex Education," "Sexual Enlightenment Education," "Casual Talks on Sex Education," "Comprehensive Guide to Two-Sex Education," "Middle School Students and Sex Education," "Guidelines for Youth Sex Education," and "Sex Education and Eugenics." In the field of sex psychology, there are books like "Sex Psychology," "Human Sexual Psychology," "Explorations in Sex Psychology," "Sex and Sexual Psychology," "Psychology of Love and Sex," and "Youth Sexual Psychology and Sexual Crimes."

Some books have low literary standards. For instance, a recent book titled "Sexual Customs" from a certain region has a table of contents that includes: "Women are your fields, cultivate them freely," "Training Prostitutes," "Brothel—The Temple of Love," and so on. The book is described as "a rare gem in the history of publishing."

This is the end of the article.

　　性知识出版物过多过滥
    本报讯  近几个月来，有关性的读物出版明显增多。目前在这类书的出版中存在一些问题，主要是：
    重复品种多。如性教育方面就有《性的教育》、《性的启蒙教育》、《性教育漫谈》、《两性教育大全》、《中学生与性教育》、《青少年性教育指南》和《性教育与优生》等；性心理方面的有《性心理学》、《人类性心理》、《性心理学探索》、《性与性的心理》、《爱与性的心理》和《青少年性心理与性犯罪》等。
    有些书的内容格调不高。如最近某地征订的《性风俗》一书，订单上该书的目录有：“女人是你的耕地，任意耕耘吧”、“训练妓女”、“娼妓会馆——爱神中心”等等。并称此书为“历年来出版史上不可多得的好书”。
