The China Youth Art Theatre is currently staging "Old Windflow Town," which tells the audience a story full of blood and tears: Two years ago, the Governor-General of Lianghuai and the Commander-in-Chief of the Southeast Coast, Fan Wuchen, was poor and destitute in his early years. During his journey to take the imperial examination, he encountered a flood and was fortunately rescued by Zheng Niangzi. Fifteen years later, when he returned to Old Windflow Town to enforce the maritime prohibition, he discovered that the mastermind behind the treason was none other than Zheng Niangzi, who had fallen into the red-light district. Thus, between the two of them, or between two different cultural personalities, a series of astonishing and moving historical dramas unfolded, a series of futile struggles for survival that led to destruction.

This is a "non-historical" historical play. It is called "non-historical" because it lacks a certain definiteness of historical time and space, and does not use traditional moral judgments or historical evaluations as a measure: Fan Wuchen is not a hero who fought against the Japanese pirates, and Zheng Niangzi is not a savior who relieved the people's suffering; brothels can all hang plaques, and prostitutes are all chaste women; Liu Yuan, the general who betrayed the country, is a hero who died without regret. It is called a historical play because it still conveys a sense of great history, but it is not obscured by short-term political interests, nor does it explain history through the virtues and vices of a few individuals. Instead, it uses a long-term, comprehensive cultural spirit to examine the historical process.

Fan Wuchen and Zheng Niangzi are both individuals with rich existential foundations, and they also represent two distinctly different cultural personalities. The former is loyal to the emperor and loves his country, enforces the law strictly, fights enemies and destroys families, and does not hesitate to work hard. All external, inhuman shackles are internalized into self-discipline, representing the ideal personality of orthodox culture. The latter observes the world with a cold eye, is unrestrained and enlightened, free and open, full of vitality, and is always driven by the impulse to seek complete freedom and satisfaction of life, representing a secular personality of non-scholarly culture. Their karmic connections, entanglements, and conflicts, although stripped of the heavy shell of history, still summon people to reflect on history and provoke people to think about the seemingly predestined fate of the nation, time and time again, in the sensory presentation of individual souls.

The director is calm, almost ruthlessly so. Wildness and debauchery, grandeur and decay, ferocity and dissipation, sharpness and cruelty, are almost two sides of the same coin. The two different cultural personalities face the same thick fog that covers the sky and the earth, and both head towards a decaying outcome, showing no signs of labor and sacrifice. It is filled with the pessimism of a lost paradise, but it is not a tragedy in the traditional sense.

We can criticize the conclusion for being too pessimistic, but we cannot deny the director's sincerity. Under the scorching sun, with corpses lying everywhere, the lonely Zheng Niangzi standing on the vast, desolate land is a state of nirvanic tranquility or a state of annihilation? Is the progress of history a necessity, a possibility, or an illusion? The director transforms his understanding of existence and history into a lively, multifaceted stage presentation, and also openly shares his puzzlement with the audience, inviting them to ponder the mysteries of history and the meaning of existence together.

　　文化的迷雾
　　——写在《老风流镇》公演的时候
　　林克欢
    中国青年艺术剧院正在演出的《老风流镇》，向观众叙述一个血泪斑斑的故事：两淮总督兼东南沿海总兵范无尘早年家境贫寒，穷困潦倒，赶考途中遭洪水之灾，幸为贞娘子所救。十五年后，当他重返老风流镇查海禁时，发现通敌的祸首恰恰是已沦落风尘的贞娘子。于是在他们两人之间，或者说在两种不同的文化人格之间，展开了一幕幕令人惊诧又令人击节的历史活剧，一次次为生存所驱同趋灭亡的徒劳挣扎。
    这是一出“非历史”的历史剧。说它是“非历史”的，因为它既缺少某种确定性的历史时空，也不以传统的道德评判与历史评判为尺度：范无尘不是抗击倭寇的功臣，贞娘子也不是解民倒悬的救星；花楼皆可挂匾，娼妇悉是贞女；通敌的刘元将军是死而无悔的英雄。说它是历史剧，因为这里仍然传达一种大历史观念，只不过它不为短期的政治功利所掩蔽，不以少数人的贤愚善恶去解释历史，而是以一种长远的、大而化之的文化精神去审视历史进程。
    范无尘与贞娘子，既是两个包容了无限丰富的生存底蕴的活生生的个体生命，又代表了两种迥然不同的文化人格。前者忠君爱国，执法如山，杀敌破家，不辞劳瘁，所有外在非人性的桎梏均内化为自律的苛求，代表一种正统文化的理想人格。后者冷眼烛世，恣肆醒豁，自由开放，生机勃勃，时时躁动着追求完全自由满足的生命冲动，代表一种非文人文化的世俗人格。他们之间的因缘、纠葛与对抗，虽已脱去历史沉重的外壳，却仍在个体心灵的感性呈现中，一次次地召唤人们反顾历史，引发人们思索几成宿命的民族运数。
    编导者是冷静的，冷静到近乎严酷。野艳与放荡，堂皇与萎靡，蛮赫与散漫，凌厉与残忍，几乎同是一体二面。两种不同的文化人格，同样面对遮天盖地的浓雾，同样趋向衰颓的结局，全然看不出劳顿与牺牲的意义。其中充盈着失乐园的悲观，却又不是传统意义的悲剧。
    我们可以责难结局未免过分悲观，却不能不相信编导者的真诚。日头当空，尸横遍野，孤零零地伫立在空茫大地上的贞娘子，是一种涅槃的宁静，还是灭绝的死寂？历史的进步，是一种必然，一种可能，一种幻想？编导者将自己对生存、对历史的感悟化作鲜活、多义的舞台呈现，也将自己的困惑坦然诉诸观众，与观众一道思索历史的奥秘与生存的意义。
