Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the courtyard economy, which uses the courtyard and surrounding non-contracted land of farmers' homes as a base, relies mainly on family labor, and aims to develop commodity economy, has made remarkable progress in China's vast rural areas. For example, in Sichuan Province's Stone City Tujia Autonomous County, 90% of the households actively develop courtyard economy centered on livestock farming. In recent years, more than 8,200 impoverished households have relied on it to get out of poverty, accounting for more than 90% of the total number of households that have escaped poverty. In Liaoning Province, more than 1.1 million households developing courtyard economy created a production value of 3.5 billion yuan in 1986, with an average net income of more than 600 yuan per household. A sample survey of 700 households in Henan Province showed that the per capita income from courtyard economy was 240 yuan in 1980, 545 yuan in 1983, and 957 yuan in 1986, doubling in seven years. In addition, there is a trend that the number of households with courtyard economy income accounting for 10-30% of the total household income is gradually decreasing, while the number of households with courtyard economy income accounting for more than 50% of the total household income is increasing year by year.

The reason why the development of the courtyard economy is so encouraging is mainly due to the following factors: First, China's rural resources are scarce and there are national customs. On the one hand, although the absolute amount of agricultural resources in China is large, the per capita amount is small. The per capita arable land in the country is less than 1.5 mu, which is not only far lower than that of countries with vast land and fewer people, but also lower than that of some densely populated countries and the world average (Australia 45.8 mu per capita, Canada 28 mu, the United States 12.7 mu, the Soviet Union 12.9 mu, India 3.7 mu; the world average is 5.2 mu). Land resources are extremely scarce, and the reserve quantity is insufficient. To fully utilize every inch of land to create social wealth, it is necessary to develop the courtyard economy. On the other hand, the residential houses of villagers and townspeople are relatively scattered, and there is a large area of courtyards and gaps (although one household is not much, but the total number in the country is a very large number), and most of them have the conditions to develop various characteristic courtyard economies such as planting, breeding, and processing. Second, the development of the courtyard economy can make use of the idle labor force and idle time of farmers (especially the elderly, weak, women, and children) to create wealth for the country and the family. At present, there are more than 100 million surplus labor force in China's rural areas every year, and it is estimated that there will be about 250 million by the end of this century. In addition, due to the seasonality of agriculture and the improvement of farmers' labor efficiency, the current agricultural labor force has about 1/5 to 1/3 of the surplus time every year. The courtyard economy, which takes the front and back of the house as the base, has played a certain role in solving this problem in the past few years. Third, the courtyard economy can provide the market with a rich variety of commodities, and farmers can obtain considerable income from this. At present, the commercial meat and eggs in China are mainly provided by farmers' courtyard breeding. Taking Henan Province as an example, at present, the commercial pigs raised by farmers account for 96% of the total market supply, sheep account for 96%, and poultry account for more than 99%. Fourth, the courtyard economy can optimize the family environment. The green plants in the courtyard, especially the fruit trees and flowers, are beautiful and fragrant; the animals in the courtyard, especially some small animals, are lively and lovely, which is particularly pleasing. Farmers living in such an environment have endless fun, not only can they obtain considerable economic benefits, but also can cultivate their minds and live a healthy life. Fifth, the courtyard economy can achieve highly intensive operation. According to a survey of 250 households in 5 counties and districts in Henan Province, the current intensive operation of the courtyard economy is mainly reflected in four aspects: first, diversified operation, wide range of projects; second, reasonable layout, high utilization rate; third, comprehensive utilization, benign cycle; fourth, emphasis on science, willing to invest. The intensive operation of the courtyard economy, especially the continuous improvement of the degree of technological intensification, has brought about "three highs": first, high land return rate, second, high labor productivity, and third, high input-output ratio.

Although China has made great achievements in the development of the courtyard economy in recent years, there are still many urgent problems to be solved in some places. The main problems are: outdated ideas and insufficient attention to the courtyard economy; some old systems and policies have become "roadblocks" to the development of the courtyard economy; the series of services are far from keeping up with the development trend; the quality of grassroots cadres and farmers is low, etc. To solve these problems, we should start from the top to the bottom, first of all, solve the problem of understanding the development of the courtyard economy within the leadership. It should not be regarded as a temporary measure, but should be regarded as an important means to develop the productive forces in the countryside in the entire primary stage of socialism and should be adhered to for a long time; secondly, we should further relax the tax, credit, industrial and commercial management, and courtyard development policies to create a relaxed environment for the courtyard economy to have a big development; thirdly, we should properly handle the relationship between the courtyard economy and the collective economy and cooperative economy, and should not rush to transition, reform, or abolish; fourthly, we should make every effort to remove obstacles and provide a series of services for the development of the courtyard economy; fifthly, we should make full use of technological progress to improve the quality of farmers; sixthly, we should treat differently and guide differently, and adopt different development measures for different regions and types of courtyard economy.

### 积极发展庭院经济

　　积极发展庭院经济
　　梁金玉
    党的十一届三中全会以来，我国广大农村以农民自家庭院及其四周非承包隙地为依托，以家庭成员为主要劳动力，以发展商品经济为宗旨的庭院经济有了可喜发展。如四川石柱土家族自治县有９０％的农户积极发展以畜牧业为主的庭院经济，近几年有８２００多个贫困户依靠它脱贫，占脱贫户总数的９０％以上。辽宁省１１０多万个发展庭院经济的农户，１９８６年创产值３５亿元，户均纯收入达６００元以上。河南省７００户抽样调查，１９８０年庭院经济人均收入仅２４０元，１９８３年上升为５４５元，１９８６年高达９５７元，７年间翻了两番。此外还有一个迹象，就是庭院经济收入占家庭各业总收入１０—３０％的户数逐步减少，而占总收入５０％以上的户数逐年增多。
    庭院经济的发展之所以如此喜人，主要是因为：第一，我国农村资源短缺及民族习惯。一方面我国农业自然资源虽然绝对量大，但人均量小。全国人均耕地不足１．５亩，不仅远远低于世界上土地辽阔、人口较少的国家，而且低于某些人口稠密的国家和世界平均数（澳大利亚人均４５．８亩，加拿大２８亩，美国１２．７亩，苏联１２．９亩，印度３．７亩；世界各国平均为５．２亩，）。土地资源奇缺，且后备数量不足，为充分利用每一寸国土创造社会财富，发展庭院经济显得十分必要。另一方面，村镇农民住宅大都相对分散，庭院空坪隙地较大（一家一户虽说不多，但全国合起来就是一个很大的数字），大多数都有条件发展种植、养殖和加工等各具特色的庭院经济。第二，发展庭院经济可以利用农家的闲散劳力及闲散时间（特别是老弱妇幼），为国为家创造财富。目前我国农村常年性剩余劳力有１亿以上，今后每年大约新增１０００万，预测本世纪末将达到２．５亿左右。此外，由于农业的季节性和农民劳动效率的提高，目前的农业劳动力，每年大约有１／５—１／３的剩余时间。而以房前屋后为基地的庭院经济，几年来在解决这个问题上起到了一定作用。第三，庭院经济可以为市场提供丰富的商品，农民可以由此获得可观的收入。目前我国的商品肉、蛋采取的是两条腿走路，而主要是靠农民庭院饲养提供。以河南省为例，目前农民饲养的商品猪占总上市量的９６％，羊占９６％，家禽占９９％以上。第四，庭院经济可以优化家庭环境。庭院中的绿色植物，特别是果木花卉等，景色优美，芳香宜人；庭院中的畜禽动物，特别是一些小动物，活泼可爱，尤其喜人。农民生活在这样的环境中乐趣无穷，不但可以取得可观的经济效益，而且还可以陶冶身心，健康长寿。第五，庭院经济可以实行高度集约化经营。据河南省对５个县区２５０户农民的调查，目前庭院经济的集约化主要表现在四个方面：一是多业经营，项目广泛；二是布局合理，利用率高；三是综合利用，良性循环；四是重视科学，舍得投入。庭院经济的集约化，特别是技术集约化程度的不断提高，带来了“三高”：一是土地报酬率高，二是劳动生产率高，三是投入产出率高。
    虽然近几年我国发展庭院经济已取得很大成绩，但在一些地方仍存在不少亟待解决的问题。主要表现在思想观念陈旧，对庭院经济重视不够；一些旧体制和老政策已经成了发展庭院经济的“拦路虎”；系列化服务远远跟不上发展形势；基层干部和农民素质低等等。针对这些问题，我们应当从上到下，首先在领导层内解决好对发展庭院经济的认识。不应把它看成是权宜之计，在整个社会主义初级阶段都应把庭院经济作为发展农村生产力的重要手段长期坚持下去；其次，应进一步放宽税收、信贷、工商管理以及庭院开发政策，为庭院经济有一个大发展创造宽松环境；其三，要摆正庭院经济与集体经济、合作经济的关系，不要急于过渡，改造、取缔；其四，多方努力，清除障碍，为庭院经济的发展提供系列服务；其五，充分利用科技进步，努力提高农民素质；其六，区别对待，分类指导，对不同地区、不同类型的庭院经济采取不同的发展措施。
