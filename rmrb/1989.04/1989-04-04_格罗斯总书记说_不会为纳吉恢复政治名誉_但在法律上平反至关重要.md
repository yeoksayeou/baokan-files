	Gross, the General Secretary of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, said today on the radio in response to questions from the public that it is not politically wise to publicly disclose evaluations of the 1956 Hungarian event that are not yet mature. He said that describing this event as a people's uprising is an oversimplification. A more accurate assessment is that it began as a student movement, an uprising, which later evolved into a counter-revolution. He added that every politician has the right to express their own views.

	Gross said that whether before or after the reburial of Nagy Imre, there will be no restoration of his political reputation, but legal rehabilitation is crucial. He pointed out that the party should evaluate Nagy Imre's political role, and therefore, is consciously and firmly excavating new materials related to this. He believes that Nagy Imre made political mistakes during those days, so there is no reason to restore his political reputation. If new materials are found, the party will re-examine the current stance. In order to better understand the situation at the time, Hungary has requested assistance from the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.

　　格罗斯总书记说
    不会为纳吉恢复政治名誉  但在法律上平反至关重要
    新华社布达佩斯４月２日电  匈牙利社会主义工人党总书记格罗斯今天在电台回答人们提出的问题时说，把与匈牙利１９５６年事件有关的、尚不成熟的评价公开出来在政治上是不明智的。把这一事件说成人民起义是简单化。比较准确的评价是，开始是学生运动，是一次起义，后来演变成反革命。他补充说，每个政治家都有权谈自己的看法。
    格罗斯说，无论是在重新安葬纳吉·伊姆雷之前或之后，都不会为他恢复政治名誉，但在法律上平反至关重要。他指出，党应该对纳吉·伊姆雷的政治作用作出评价，因此，正在有意识地和坚定地发掘有关这方面的新材料。他认为，纳吉·伊姆雷在那些日子里有政治性错误，所以没有理由为他恢复政治名誉。如果发现新的材料，党将重新研究现在的立场。为了更好地了解当时的情况，匈牙利已请求苏联和南斯拉夫给予帮助。
