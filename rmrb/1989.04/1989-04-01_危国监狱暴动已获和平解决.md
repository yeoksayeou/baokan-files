Guatemala prison riot resolved peacefully

	BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Guatemalan authorities and the inmates who had taken over the "Quetzal" prison reached an agreement yesterday to improve prison conditions, and the rioters laid down their weapons and released the hostages. The four-day riot was thus peacefully resolved.

	Last Sunday (March 26), inmates at the "Quetzal" prison, located 35 kilometers east of Guatemala City, suddenly revolted. They seized some weapons from the armory, took over the prison, and held 500 visitors hostage. In the exchange of fire between the rioters and the police, seven people were killed and more than 20 were injured. The inmates demanded amnesty, reduced sentences, the replacement of prison officials, and improved prison conditions. After the incident, the Guatemalan authorities strengthened the blockade and siege of the prison while sending representatives to negotiate with the inmates. President Cerezo ordered the police not to storm the prison and to avoid bloodshed as much as possible.

	In the agreement reached yesterday, the government agreed to replace the prison leadership and the guard force, guarantee the safety of the inmates, and improve prison conditions. The inmates agreed to have the government request the judicial authorities not to prosecute the rioters and to propose reduced sentences to the Congress.

    本报加拉加斯３月３１日电  记者朱满庭报道：危地马拉当局和占领“孔雀”监狱的犯人昨天就改善狱中条件达成协议，暴动者放下武器，释放了人质，持续４天的暴动事件得到和平解决。
    上星期日（２６日），危地马拉首都东部３５公里处的“孔雀”监狱的犯人，突然起事。他们从枪械库弄到部分枪支，武装占领了监狱，并把５００名前来探监的人扣作人质。在暴动犯人与警察的交火中，有７人死亡、２０多人受伤。犯人提出了大赦、减刑、撤换监狱负责人、改善狱中条件等要求。事件发生后，危地马拉当局一方面加强对监狱的封锁包围，一方面派出代表与犯人进行谈判。塞雷索总统要求警方不要强夺监狱，尽量避免流血。
    在昨天达成的协议中，政府方面同意更换监狱领导人和警戒部队，保证犯人的人身安全、改善狱中条件，犯人同意由政府向司法部门提出对这些暴动分子不加追究，向国会提出减刑。
