Since 1987, China has started to levy the personal income adjustment tax to regulate the excessive income gap. What problems exist in the collection of this tax? Listen to the following:

A Model "Tax Officer's" Grievances

New China News Agency reporters Zhou Baohua, New China News Agency correspondent Meng Huàn

Fang Shuo, 45 years old this year, was transferred back to Shenyang from Guangxi three years ago, switching from a conductor to a "tax officer." Although he is a newcomer, his work is meticulous and his achievements are significant: In 1988, the He Ping District Tax Bureau of Shenyang City assigned a personal adjustment tax collection task of 450,000 yuan. Fang Shuo, as the team leader, led four tax collectors and completed 777,800 yuan. Therefore, he was rated as an outstanding tax collector in the entire bureau. However, when the reporter talked to him about the personal adjustment tax collection work, this open-minded man seemed to have been struck by a jar of mixed emotions, and he began to vent his grievances about the collection work:

Last April, they discovered that the manager of the Shenyang New Electrical Appliance Store had tax evasion issues. After verification, the tax bureau decided to order the manager to make up the tax of 5,828 yuan within a limited time, and because of the malicious tax evasion methods, an additional penalty equal to the tax amount was imposed. However, when notifying the manager, the latter said: "The matter is clear, you handle it as you see fit. I have connections in the district and the city." and refused to pay the tax. One day, a deputy district head suddenly summoned Fang Shuo and the section chief, instructing them not to collect the tax from that person. Fang Shuo argued according to the law for a few sentences, but this deputy district head became very angry, pounding the table and saying: "You have only worn the tax uniform for a few days, do you understand the tax law? Who do you think you are, go back to your music conducting!" He even threatened, "Being transferred out is letting you off easy!"

Talking about these things, Fang Shuo had deep feelings: "The personal income adjustment tax is a new tax in our country. Although the collection business is relatively simple, the management difficulties exceed any other tax."

He believed that the most difficult part is that the collection of this tax lacks necessary legal guarantees. In Japan, paying taxes according to the law, along with labor and education, are listed as the three major obligations of citizens; for those who delay or evade taxes, the tax authorities have the right to audit, and if necessary, with the approval of the prosecution department, they can conduct compulsory searches or report to the prosecution authorities for prosecution, and if found, the penalty amount will be retroactively applied for 7 years. We often hear about such things: In foreign countries, some celebrities run away to avoid taxes, but as soon as they return to the country, they are immediately arrested by the police. Here, it's the opposite: a deputy district head just slams the table, and the tax authorities can only stare blankly. Tax collection is a matter of law enforcement, it is compulsory, but where is our compulsion? Last year, when we checked the accounts of a company, we found that the company had forged the employee roster and used the method of false reporting to evade the personal income adjustment tax in installments. However, this company not only did not pay the tax according to the regulations, but the accountant also scolded me to the point of exhaustion, and even threatened to fight with me, making it impossible for me to perform my duties. Afterwards, although it went through many twists and turns, the 3,000-plus yuan of personal income adjustment tax that the company evaded was still not collected.

Fang Shuo said: Because our tax law is not rigid enough, and the propaganda is also poor, it leads to the current poor tax awareness of the people. Last year, out of the 777,800 yuan of personal income adjustment tax we collected, less than 5% was voluntarily reported, and more than 95% was collected by us going door-to-door, turning tax collection into tax recovery. One day in August last year, someone came to the tax bureau to expose that the Liaoning Science and Technology Newspaper and a certain person from Xianyang City, Shaanxi Province, jointly held a "Bilirubin Extraction Study Class," with a three-day session, already held seven sessions, and each student was charged 360 yuan without issuing a formal receipt. That afternoon, the last session was about to end. I rushed to the lecture site by bicycle. After several twists and turns, I finally recovered 130,000 yuan in taxes. Afterwards, I thought, if the action had been delayed by half a step, the tax would have been lost once the lecturer left. If we think about it from another angle, if the taxpayer does not voluntarily report and no one exposes it, who knows how much tax is lost in the vast sea of people. What's even more annoying is that some units actually collude with taxpayers, using "flexible" methods to evade the adjustment tax. Take the performing arts troupe as an example, we rely on daily newspapers and radio broadcasts to know which theater has a performance, and then go door-to-door to collect taxes. However, the theater and the tax department have two different minds, and they do not let them withhold taxes, because once the tax is withheld, the famous performers will not come. We go to collect taxes, and the theater and the performing troupe cooperate tacitly, nominally only receiving subsidies during their stay in Shenyang, but actually distributing large sums of money after leaving Shenyang. With this little trick, those who should pay the personal income adjustment tax escape.

Fang Shuo said, my father initially named me Fang Shuo, and my brother Fang Bo, he hoped that our family could produce a scholar or a doctor. Who would have thought that I became a "tax"? Since I have become a "tax," I will do my best in this field. However, the various interferences mentioned above make the personal income adjustment tax, which is inherently highly concealed, even more difficult to collect. To be honest, our five people worked to the fullest last year and only collected 770,000 yuan, which is only a small part of the taxable amount, and a large amount of personal income adjustment tax has "leaked, spilled, dripped, and escaped."

Fang Shuo believes that the state should formulate the "Tax Litigation Law," starting from legislation, strengthen the legal construction of taxation. The departments of industry and commerce, public security, auditing, etc., should closely cooperate with the tax department, and deal with those who evade personal income adjustment tax seriously, and reflect the dignity of the law. Currently, Beijing is starting the personal income reporting system, which is an important measure, but if it is hidden and not reported truthfully, it is necessary to have a rigid measure.

### 一位模范“税官”的苦衷

    从一九八七年起，我国开始征收个人收入调节税，以调节收入差距的过分悬殊。那么，目前在征收这一税种中存在哪些问题呢？请听——
　　一位模范“税官”的苦衷
    新华社记者　周保华　新华社通讯员　孟唤
    今年４５岁的傅硕，三年前从广西调回沈阳，由乐队指挥改行当了“税官”。别看他半路出家是个新手，但工作认真，成绩不小：１９８８年沈阳市和平区税务分局下达个人调节税征收任务４５万元，作为组长的傅硕带领４名税管员，竟完成了７７．７８万元。因此，他被评为全局优秀税管员。然而，当记者和他谈起个人调节税征收工作时，这位开朗的汉子似乎被撞倒了心中的五味瓶，开场就倾诉起征收工作中的苦衷——
    去年４月，他们发现沈阳市新兴机电产品商店承包人有偷漏个人调节税问题，经查实后，税务分局决定令其限期补税５８２８元，由于其偷漏税手段恶劣并处以一倍的罚款。但是通知承包人时，对方却说：“事情明摆着，你看着办，我在区里、市里可都有人。”拒不补税。一天，一位副区长突然把傅硕和科长找去，指示不准收那个人的税款。傅硕依法申辩了几句，这位副区长竟然大动肝火，拍着桌子说：“你穿税服才几天，懂税法吗？你算什么东西，搞你的音乐指挥去吧！”还威胁说：“调出去算便宜了你！”
    谈起这些事，傅硕深有感触：“个人收入调节税是我国的一个新税种，虽然征收业务较为简单，可征管方面的困难却超过任何一个税种”。
    他认为最难之处在于征收这个税种缺乏必要的法律保障。在日本，依法纳税与劳动、受教育并列为国民的三大义务；对迟交或偷漏税者，税务部门有权稽查，必要时经检察部门批准可进行强制性搜查或报检察机关起诉，查出后罚款额要上追７年。我们常听到这样的事：在外国有的名人为了逃税跑到国外，可回国后立即被警方抓了起来。我们这儿倒好，某个副区长一拍桌子，税务部门只好干瞪眼。征税是依法办事，是有强制性的，可我们的强制性在哪里呢？去年我们在检查一家公司的帐目时，发现该公司伪造职工花名册，通过虚报冒领的手段化整为零偷漏个人收入调节税。可是这家公司不但不照章纳税，公司会计还把我骂个狗血喷头，甚至扬言要与我玩命，使我无法执行公务。事后，虽几经周折，这家公司偷漏的３０００多元个人收入调节税还是没有收上来。”
    傅硕说：由于我们税法的刚性不够，舆论宣传也差，导致了目前人们的纳税意识太差。去年我们征收的７７．７８万元个人收入调节税中，主动申报的不到５％，其余９５％以上是靠我们登门要的，征税变成了查收。去年８月的一天，有人来税务分局揭发辽宁科技报社与陕西咸阳市某人联合举办“胆红素提取学习班”，三天一期，已开了七期，每个学员收费３６０元，不给开正式收据。这天下午最后一期将结束。蹬车赶到讲课地点。经过几番周折，最后查补税款１．３万元。事后我想，如果这次动作慢了半拍，讲课者一走，这笔税款就流失了。若换个角度去想，纳税人不主动申报又没有人检举的，在茫茫人海中谁知有多少。更可恼的是，一些单位竟与纳税人合伙，采取“变通”手段逃避调节税。就拿演出团体来说，我们是靠每天看报、听广播才知道哪个剧场有演出活动，然后登门征税的。然而，剧场同税务部门两条心，让他们代扣，不成。因为一扣税，名演员不来了。我们去查收，剧场与演出队配合默契，名义上在沈阳期间只拿补助费，其实大笔收入离沈后再分肥。这么一小招，应交纳个人收入调节税者就逃之夭夭了。
    傅硕说，我爹当初给我起名叫傅硕，给我哥起名叫傅博，他希望家里能出个硕士、博士什么的。谁想我竟成为“赋税”了。既然成了“赋税”就要干好这行。可上述的种种干扰，使本身就具有很大隐蔽性的个人收入调节税，征收起来难上加难。说实在的，我们５个人一年尽全力才征收７７万多元，只占应征税款的一小部分，大量的个人收入调节税“跑、冒、滴、漏”了。
    傅硕认为，国家有必要制定《税务诉讼法》，从立法上着手，加强税收的法制建设。工商、公安、审计等部门应当同税务部门密切配合，对逃避个人收入调节税者，处理要严肃，要体现法的威严。目前北京开始搞个人收入申报制度，这是一个重要措施，但硬是隐瞒不如实申报，就需要有刚性手段。
