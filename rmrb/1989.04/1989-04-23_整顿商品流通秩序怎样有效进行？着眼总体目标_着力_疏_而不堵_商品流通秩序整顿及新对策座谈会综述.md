Recently, at a symposium on the rectification of the order of commodity circulation and new strategies convened by the Minister of Commerce, Hu Ping, the following ideas were discussed.

First, focus on the goal and choose measures. Rectifying the economic environment and the order of commodity circulation is not a retreat from reform, nor should it lay obstacles for future reforms. Instead, it is a process of buffering, coordinating, and perfecting the conditions for the next step of comprehensive deepening of reforms, thereby steadily realizing the overall goal of a new socialist commodity economy system. Only by first clarifying the big goal and big picture can one then choose the appropriate measures. If people determine to adhere to a system with a planned economy as the mainstay, they will inevitably restore the authority of mandatory planning. If people determine to gradually transition to a new economic system based on market regulation, then more economic and legislative measures should be adopted, and administrative measures should be used as little as possible or for a short period, mainly for illegal and disorderly activities. If goals conflict with each other, measures conflict with each other, or measures conflict with goals, it will inevitably lead to short-term behavior, making it difficult to effectively rectify the economic environment and the order of commodity circulation.

Second, "dredge" rather than "block," "control" but not "over-control." Rectifying the economic environment and the order of commodity circulation requires a comprehensive approach using economic, legislative, and administrative measures. Overusing and rushing administrative measures can only gain a brief respite but cannot fundamentally rectify the order of commodity circulation, making the market stable and active in the long term. The current rectification should be like Yu the Great controlling floods, mainly adopting a dredging policy, "dredging" rather than "blocking." "Dredging" brings activity, "blocking" brings stagnation, this is the principle of rectification. The primary job of commerce is to engage in the circulation of commodities, and every effort should be made to activate it and promote smooth circulation. Of course, necessary regulation is needed, but "control" should not be excessive or too harsh. Otherwise, not only will it not cure the chaos, but it will also cause the old system to return, the market to degrade, and greater chaos to ensue. Therefore, as the best strategy for rectification and rectification, efforts should be made to achieve "dredging" rather than "blocking," and "controlling" but not "over-controlling."

Third, control the "head" and activate the "flow." In the process of rectification, it is still necessary to steadily cultivate and improve the market mechanism and promote the construction of a market system with organizational, open, and competitive characteristics. It is necessary to adhere to the development of a unified socialist market, break down administrative barriers, break through blockades and regionalism, and resolutely prevent the use of administrative means to obstruct commodity circulation. In the process of improving the market mechanism, it is necessary to control the "head" of the market and activate the "flow" of the market, that is: control wholesale and activate retail. The so-called control of wholesale does not mean, as in traditional practices, to control all wholesale commerce, but rather to achieve standardized management through the establishment of market rules. For example, who can operate wholesale commerce and who cannot; who can enter the market and who cannot; which prices should be adjusted and which should be released, etc. In addition, the development of wholesale markets should be continued, and a few futures markets can be tried, gradually improving and perfecting the market system composed of primary, intermediate, and high-level markets.

Fourth, maintain a reasonable proportion between production and circulation. To establish a normal order of commodity circulation, it is necessary to create the premise of a reasonable proportion between production and circulation. Although China's circulation is still underdeveloped and needs to be developed, the degree of circulation expansion should be adapted to the scale of production development. Although China is currently a seller's market and needs to develop various retail businesses, it should maintain a generally appropriate proportion with wholesale businesses. Although in the reform, it is necessary to break through the single state-owned commercial component and develop individual, collective, and private commerce, various commercial components also need to have a general proportion. Finally, it is necessary to increase the circulation channels according to the development of production and the needs of the reform process, and to maintain a reasonable proportion between the main channels and multiple channels. If these related reasonable proportions can be created and maintained, then the order of circulation can be ensured to move from "chaos" to "order" and from disorder to order.

　　整顿商品流通秩序怎样有效进行？    
    着眼总体目标　着力“疏”而不堵    
    ——商品流通秩序整顿及新对策座谈会综述
    不久前，在商业部长胡平召开的商品流通秩序整顿及新对策座谈会上，发言者谈了以下思想。
    第一，着眼目标，选择措施。治理经济环境、整顿流通秩序不是改革的倒退，也不可为未来的改革埋下障碍，而是经过缓冲、协调和完善为下一步全面深化改革创造条件，进而稳步实现社会主义商品经济新体制的总体目标。只有先明确大目标、大格局，然后才能择其适应措施。如果人们确定坚持以计划经济为主的体制，就势必恢复指令性计划的权威；如果人们确定逐步向以市场调节为基础的新经济体制过渡，那么应当多采取经济和立法措施，尽可能少运用或短期运用行政手段，且后者应主要用于违法乱纪方面。假若目标与目标、措施与措施、措施与目标相互打架，必然导致短期行为，很难有效地治理好经济环境和整顿好流通秩序。
    第二，“疏”而不“堵”，“控”而不“过”。治理经济环境，整顿流通秩序，需要“多管齐下”采取经济、立法和行政等措施。过多、过急采取行政措施，只能够获得一个喘息的机会，而不能从根本上整顿好流通秩序，使市场走上长期稳定而活跃的道路。目前的治理和整顿，要像夏禹治水那样，主要采取疏导的方针，“疏”而不“堵”。“疏”则活，“堵”则死，这是治理之道。商业的本职是从事商品流通的，应千方百计搞活，促进货畅其流。当然，必要的调控是需要的，但“控”不能过头，不能过猛。否则，不仅不能根治乱，反而会使旧体制复归，市场退化，造成更大混乱。因此，作为治理和整顿的上策，应努力做到“疏”而不“堵”，“控”而不“过”。
    第三，把住“龙头”，放活“水流”。在治理和整顿过程中，仍然需要稳步地培育和完善市场机制，推进具有组织性、公开性、竞争性特点的市场体系的建设。要坚持发展社会主义统一市场，打破行政壁垒，冲开封锁割据，力戒用行政化手段去阻碍商品流通。在完善市场机制的过程中，要把住市场的“龙头”，放活市场的“水流”，即：管住批发，放活零售。所谓管住批发，并不意味着像传统的做法那样抓住所有的批发商业，而是要通过建立市场规则实现管理规范化。例如，规定谁能经营，谁不能经营批发商业；谁能进入市场，谁不能进入市场；哪些价格该调，哪些价格该放，等等。此外，应该继续发展批发市场，还可试办少数期货市场，逐步健全和完善由初级、中级和高级市场组成的市场体系。
    第四，保持生产与流通的合理比例。欲建立商品流通的正常秩序，需要创造生产和流通之间合理比例的前提。固然，中国的流通还很不发达，需要发展，但流通扩展的程度应与生产发展的规模保持相适应的比例。固然，我国现在还是卖方市场，需要发展多种零售商业，但应与批发商业保持大体恰当的比例。固然，在改革中必须突破单一国营商业成份，发展个体、集体和私营商业，然而，各种成份的商业也需要有一个大体比例。最后，还要根据生产的发展和改革进程的需要，增加流通渠道，并使主渠道与多渠道保持合理比例。如果能创造和保持与此有关的种种合理比例关系，那么，就能从结构上保证流通秩序由“乱”走向“治”，由无序走向有序。
