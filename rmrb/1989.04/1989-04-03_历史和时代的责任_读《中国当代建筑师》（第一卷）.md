In a hurry, I tore open a package from Beijing containing a heavy, large 16-op hardcover book titled "Contemporary Chinese Architects" Volume 1.

Late at night, under the lamplight, I picked up the book again, feeling excited. The uniquely designed Hangzhou Huanglong Hotel, the Beijing "Duyiju" with its strong maritime flavor, the Snake Mouth Hotel in Shenzhen that rises like a giant wave, and the Beijing Olympic Sports Center for the 11th Asian Games... Accompanied by the voices and smiles of the architects, they entered my study, came to my desk, so familiar and lovable. There are a few architects I have not met in person, but their representative works have long been archived in my memory—such as the Beijing International Exhibition Center, Lhasa Hotel, White Swan Hotel, Tianjin Youth Activity Center, Guilin Ludi Rock Pavilion, and Shenzhen's Silver Lake Tourist Village, Science Museum, and Jincheng Building... Those new images, bold colors, beautiful lines, and exquisite small items have already conversed with me, exchanged hearts, and once made me shocked and unforgettable.

What shocked me even more was that from this book, I could see that these 50 architects, all around 50 years old, who were trained in New China, had once been discriminated against like bricklayers, tailors, and carpenters, expelled, sent down to the countryside, and endured unbearable hardships. However, they all endured and survived, like the withered lotus showing fresh roots, like an ancient tree blooming new flowers, dedicating themselves selflessly and sincerely to the happiness of their motherland and nation!

What they dedicated was not just architectural works, but also their architectural philosophy, aesthetic thoughts, and creative views expressed in writing, like declarations, torches, and banners, walking from the countryside and factories to the cities and the world, letting the world see their hearts beating and burning, unwilling to sink!

They want to establish their own "school" and "ism," no longer following others to pick up scraps. Dazzling independent personalities, tenacious self-consciousness, combined with fiery creative passion and lofty national spirit, penetrate the paper, making the reader admire them.

Can our people, our government, give our architects the corresponding honor and status for this? Can they provide them with good creative conditions and environment for this?

It can be asserted that if no one builds monuments for architects like they do for actors and singers, introducing them to society and to today and tomorrow, then for architects and architectural works, at most, they can only be like the Tiananmen Gate, which is carried onto the national emblem, but no one knows who designed it. No one knows how important architecture and architects are to our era, history, nation, and motherland. How regrettable that would be!

Fortunately, this is a new society and a new era. Things that previous generations did not consider, someone is considering them. Things that previous generations did not do, someone is doing them. This book, "Contemporary Chinese Architects" (Volume 1), with rich data and beautiful illustrations, is the first book in Chinese history to specially compile and introduce our own architects. First of all, we should thank Mr. Zeng Shaoquan, the editor-in-chief of "World Architecture" at Tsinghua University in Beijing, who, in the gaps of his busy work, dragged his long-suffering wife to devote himself to this great cause; and Zhang Zaiyuan, the deputy director of the Architecture Department at Wuhan University, this young associate professor, who, despite the scorching heat of the "Furnace," shed a lot of sweat for this book. Of course, we should not forget the Tianjin Science and Technology Press, which, in the abnormal state of the publishing industry today, is willing to spare no effort to present this good book to readers. I think this is because they know that this is the responsibility of history and the era. Let us welcome Volume 2 and Volume 3 with confidence... and see them published soon.

　　历史和时代的责任
    ——读《中国当代建筑师》（第一卷）
    洪铁城
    匆忙拆封，是北京寄来的一本沉沉的大１６开红色硬壳新书——《中国当代建筑师》第一卷。
    夜阑人静，欠身灯下，再次捧读，兴奋不已。别具一格的杭州黄龙饭店，带有浓浓海味的北京“独一居”，像巨浪一样卷起的蛇口南海饭店，还有十一届亚运会北京奥林匹克体育中心……伴着建筑师的声音笑貌，闯进我的书房，来到我的案前，好亲切，好可爱。有几位建筑师还未曾见过面，但他们的代表作，早在我的记忆库中归档——如北京国际展览中心、拉萨饭店、白天鹅宾馆、天津青少年活动中心、桂林芦笛岩水榭以及深圳的银湖旅游村、科学馆、金城大厦……那些崭新的形象、大胆的色彩、优美的线条、精巧的小品，早和我对过话、谈过心，曾使我为之震惊，久久不敢忘却。
    使我震惊的，还有从这本书字里行间可以看出这５０位５０岁左右的新中国自己培养的建筑师，曾像泥水木匠裁缝师一样受歧视，扫地出门，上山下乡，经受过不堪回首的艰辛磨难。然而他们都熬过来了，坚强地活下来了，像容颜憔悴的秋荷呈出鲜藕，像古树老丫绽开新花，为自己的祖国和民族的幸福，作出了无私而虔诚的奉献！
    奉献的不仅仅是建筑作品，还有他们用文字表达的建筑哲学、美学思想、创作观点，像宣言、像火炬、像旗号，从农村工矿走向城市走向世界，让世人看到他们那一颗颗不甘沉沦的心在跳动在燃烧！
    他们要建立自己的“流派”，自己的“主义”，再也不跟在人家身后捡破烂。夺目的独立人格，顽强的自主意识，合着火热的创作激情，高扬的民族魂灵，力透纸背，令读者为之倾倒。
    我们的人民、我们的政府，能不能因此给自己的建筑师以相应的荣誉、地位，能不能因此为他们提供良好的创作条件和创作环境呢？
    可以断言，如果没有人为建筑师像为演员、歌唱家一样“树碑立传”，介绍给社会，介绍给今天、明天，那末对于建筑师和建筑作品，最多只能像天安门那样，只有人把它搬上国徽，却无人知道出于哪位建筑师之手；不知道建筑和建筑师对于我们时代、历史、民族和祖国，有多大的作用和意义。这该有多么遗憾！
    如今毕竟是新社会新时代，前人不曾考虑的事情有人考虑了，前人没有做的事情有人做了。这本资料翔实、图文并茂的《中国当代建筑师》（第一卷），就是中国历史上第一本专门结集介绍自己建筑师的书。这首先要感谢北京清华大学《世界建筑》主编曾绍奋先生，在繁忙工作的缝隙，拖着久病的夫人，投身到这件大事上来；还有武汉大学建筑系副主任张在元，这位年轻的副教授，不顾“大火炉”的酷热，为此书淌下大量的汗水。当然，不能遗忘的还有天津科技出版社，在当今出版事业很不正常的情况下，愿意不惜工本为读者推出这本好书。我想，这是因为他们知道，这是历史和时代的责任。让我们满怀信心地迎接第二卷第三卷……早日问世。
