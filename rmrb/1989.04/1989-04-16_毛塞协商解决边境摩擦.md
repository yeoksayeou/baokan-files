Mauritania and Senegal are negotiating to resolve recent border frictions.

Xinhua News Agency, Nouakchott, April 13 (Reporter Wang Tianrui) - Residents of Mauritania and Senegal have recently had several altercations along the border, drawing the attention of both governments. They are now actively consulting to seek a peaceful resolution and prevent the situation from escalating.

It is reported that on April 8 and 9, Senegalese farmers and Mauritanian herders had disputes over farming and grazing in the border area, resulting in fights and casualties. The day after the incident, Mauritania's head of state, Taya, summoned the Senegalese ambassador to Mauritania. On April 12, Senegal's presidential envoy and Minister of the Interior, Andre Sonko, arrived in Mauritania to deliver a letter from Diouf to Taya.

Sonko revealed to the media that Diouf expressed his hope for strengthening the sincere brotherly relationship between Senegal and Mauritania in the letter.

The two countries, separated by the Senegal River, share a 600-kilometer border. Historically, residents on both sides of the river have had close interactions. In the early 1960s, after both countries gained independence, residents on both sides continued to graze and farm in each other's territories. Disputes over farmland and grazing areas have occasionally occurred. From the end of last year to the beginning of this year, due to border resident conflicts, cross-border travel and commercial exchanges between the two countries were disrupted.

　　毛塞协商解决边境摩擦
    新华社努瓦克肖特４月１３日电　（记者王天瑞）毛里塔尼亚和塞内加尔两国居民近日在边境多次发生摩擦，引起两国政府的关注，现正在积极磋商，争取合理解决，防止事态的扩大。
    据悉，４月８日和９日，塞内加尔农民和毛里塔尼亚牧民由于耕种和放牧问题在边境地区发生纠纷，双方斗殴，造成人员伤亡。事发后第二天，毛里塔尼亚国家元首塔亚召见了塞内加尔驻毛大使。１２日，塞总统特使、内政部长安德烈·松科专程抵毛，向塔亚转交了迪乌夫的信件。
    松科向新闻界透露，迪乌夫在信中表示了希望加强塞毛两国间真诚兄弟关系的愿望。
    以塞内加尔河为界的毛塞两国有６００多公里的边界线。在历史上，塞河两岸的居民来往密切。６０年代初，两国分别获得独立后，两岸居民迄今仍在对方境内放牧和耕种。两国居民间的耕地和牧场纠葛时有发生。去年底到今年初，因边境居民发生摩擦，两国间的边境往来和商业交易中断。
