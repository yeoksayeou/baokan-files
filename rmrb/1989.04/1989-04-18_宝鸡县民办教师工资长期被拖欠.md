Since January, many private teachers in Baoji County have not received the state-subsidized living allowance of over thirty yuan per month. Many villages and groups have also delayed the payment of private teachers' salaries, with some teachers not receiving their salaries for several years. Currently, more than 2,000 private teachers in the county are facing difficulties in their livelihoods.

　　宝鸡县民办教师工资长期被拖欠
    元月以来，宝鸡县许多地方的民办教师领不到国家负担的每月三十多元生活补贴费。不少村组也对民办教师的工资一拖再拖，有的老师已长达数年领不到工资。目前，全县有二千多名民办教师生活无着落。
