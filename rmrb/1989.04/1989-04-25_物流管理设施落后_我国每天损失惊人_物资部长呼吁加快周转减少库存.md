Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 25th.

The backward state of logistics management and facilities is causing China to suffer enormous daily losses. Minister of the State Planning Commission Liu Suinian revealed today to domestic and foreign experts that currently, hundreds of millions of tons of materials are in transit on railways every day. If we calculate an average of 800 yuan per ton, tens of billions of yuan in working capital are tied up in railway transit. If the transportation speed is increased and the in-transit materials are reduced by 10,000 tons, nearly 10 million yuan in working capital can be saved daily.

The 8th International Logistics Conference opened today in Beijing. More than 300 experts and scholars from 19 countries and regions gathered to discuss and exchange research findings and practical experiences in logistics science. The conference's theme is: "Logistics Innovation and Socio-Economic Development."

Liu Suinian assessed the current state of China's logistics work: "Transportation remains a weak link in China's national economy, with a relatively low comprehensive level of logistics, and many irrational logistics practices are prevalent."

He said that due to the outdated notion that means of production are not commodities, China has long implemented a single national planning allocation system, leading to segmented management, multiple transfer links, slow circulation, and many important materials being both in short supply and excessively stockpiled. Over the past decade, China's steel inventory has consistently been between 2,000 and 3,000 million tons, equivalent to five or six months of national consumption, resulting in a large amount of steel and capital being tied up and wasted. Therefore, it is an urgent task in China's economic work to activate circulation, speed up turnover, and reduce inventory.

### 物流管理设施落后  我国每天损失惊人  物资部长呼吁加快周转减少库存

　　物流管理设施落后    
    我国每天损失惊人    
    物资部长呼吁加快周转减少库存
    本报北京４月２５日讯  物流管理和物流设施方面的落后，使我国每日都在蒙受巨大的损失。物资部长柳随年今天向中外专家透露，目前我国每天有数百万吨物资处于铁路运输途中，若以每吨平均８００元计算，就有数十亿元流动资金滞留在铁路运输途中。如果加快运输速度，使在途物资减少１万吨，每天就可节约近千万元流动资金。
    第８届国际物流会议今天在北京召开，来自世界１９个国家和地区的３００多名专家、学者欢聚一堂，共同探讨、交流物流科学的研究成果和实践经验。大会讨论的主题是：物流革新与社会、经济发展。
    柳随年对我国物流工作现况作了估价：运输在中国国民经济中仍是一个薄弱环节，物流的综合水平比较低，物流不合理的现象相当普遍。
    他说，由于受生产资料不是商品这一陈旧观念的束缚，中国过去长期实行单一的国家计划分配调拨制度，造成条块分割，中转环节多，流通缓慢，许多重要物资一方面供应短缺，另一方面又超储积压。近十年来，中国钢材库存一直保持在２０００—３０００万吨之间，相当于全国五六个月的消费量，造成钢材、资金的大量积压浪费。由此可见，搞活流通，加快周转，降低库存，是中国经济工作中一项紧迫的任务。
