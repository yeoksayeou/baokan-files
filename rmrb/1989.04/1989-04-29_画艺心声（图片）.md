The ancient city of Warsaw, situated by the Vistula River, is uniquely charming. The red-walled, golden-roofed palace stands majestically; the old streets paved with cobblestones are quaint and elegant. Strolling through the streets, the melodious strains of Chopin's nocturnes wafting from old shops enchant the visitors, making them linger and reluctant to leave.

The Polish printmaker Felicja Pautsch's work "A Street in Old Warsaw" (see illustration) vividly depicts the enchanting scenery of old Warsaw. The composition is ingeniously crafted, with bold and powerful lines. The harmonious blend of orange-red tones and large blocks of black and white contrasts creates a captivating and rhythmically musical visual experience, rich in artistic charm.

Felicja Pautsch is an octogenarian female printmaker. Many of her works have been exhibited abroad. Although Pautsch has never been to China, she holds deep respect for China's ancient and splendid culture.

    画艺心声
    位于维斯瓦河畔的华沙古城，别具风采。红墙金顶的皇宫，巍峨壮观；用鹅卵石铺成的老街，古朴典雅。漫步在街头，从老店里飘出悦耳的肖邦小夜曲，陶醉游人，留连忘返。
    波兰版画家费莉恰·波蒂尼斯卡创作的《古城华沙一条街》（见图）生动地表现了华沙古城的迷人景色。作品构图独具匠心，线条粗犷有力，桔红色的调子和大块的黑白对比，协调和谐，画面引人入胜，富有音乐的节奏感和艺术韵味。
    费莉恰·波蒂尼斯卡是一位年已古稀的女版画家。她的许多作品曾在国外展出。波蒂尼斯卡虽然没有到过中国，但对中国古老灿烂的文化怀有深深的敬意。
