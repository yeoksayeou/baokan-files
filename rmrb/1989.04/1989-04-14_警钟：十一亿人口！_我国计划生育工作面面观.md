Since July 11, 1987, the "World 50 Billion Population Day," the global population has been increasing by 150 people every minute. The entire Earth has sounded the alarm for population control, especially in China, the most populous country, where the pressure from population growth has already affected national development and the survival of the nation.

In cities, residential buildings are springing up one after another, and in rural areas, new houses are lined up in rows. Yet, people still complain about being too crowded. Cars, buses, and trains have already congested many transportation routes, yet people still say it's difficult to find a seat.

People, people, people! Population pressure has become one of the root causes of many social problems in contemporary China today.

The Maximum Population Capacity Worth Noting

What is the maximum population capacity of the Earth? How much population can the Chinese land support?

Some experts believe that the global population should not exceed 10 billion. The current population has already seriously disrupted the ecological balance, and the consequences are unimaginable.

Most scholars believe that 11 billion is the upper limit for the world to maintain a reasonable and healthy, albeit not luxurious, lifestyle. At the current rate of population growth, the world population will reach this critical point in no more than 50 to 60 years.

The population situation in China is even more severe. The two peaks of high fertility in the 1950s and 1962-1975 have formed a significant population doubling stage. What will be the highest value of the total population growth in the coming decades? The key lies in the condition of family planning work. Experts analyze that if our work is solid, the total fertility rate can be maintained at the replacement level, and the peak of the total population can be controlled at 1.5 billion. If the current fertility level (the total fertility rate of women of childbearing age is 2.3-2.4) continues, by the middle of the next century, the population will reach 1.7-1.8 billion. If the work is flawed, the peak of population growth may exceed 2 billion, possibly bringing disastrous consequences to the entire nation.

This is not the end of the problem. Accompanying the peak of total population growth are the peaks of the elderly population and the labor-age population. According to experts' predictions using purposeful methods, China's aging process has begun to accelerate, and it will enter a period of rapid aging in the 1990s. By the year 2000, the population of elderly people aged 60 and above will increase to 129-135 million. Some estimate that the peak of the elderly population will exceed 300 million. Regarding the labor-age population, the employment problem in rural areas is quite prominent. According to a sample survey, from 1987 to 2000, the average annual number of rural people exiting the labor-age population in China was less than 7 million, while the number entering the labor-age population exceeded 18 million. By 2000, the cumulative increase will be more than 100 million, and the total number of agricultural laborers will exceed 350 million. However, only 160 million are needed for farming, and 190 million surplus laborers need to be transferred to non-agricultural sectors.

The research team of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' National Conditions Analysis Project pointed out that the three population peaks will come one after another and overlap, exacerbating the already tense contradictions between population, food, resources, environment, and energy.

Food is the foundation of people's livelihood. The amount of food is constrained by the quantity of arable land. Although China's land output rate has increased rapidly, the yield per unit area in 1985 was 274.8% higher than in 1961, far exceeding the world average, but due to the large total demand for population, it can only maintain a subsistence level. Whether this level can be maintained until the end of the century depends on China's agricultural investment, population control, and prevention of encroachment on arable land. The situation is very severe.

Some experts analyze that the three population peaks will exert enormous pressure on the ecology and resources, leaving us and future generations with very little room to maneuver. Some estimate that the maximum population critical point that China's economy can supply and resources can bear is 1.5 billion. At that time, if the death rate and birth rate cannot be gradually balanced, the prospects for the Chinese nation are not optimistic.

Factors Constraining Population Control

How did this severe situation come about?

Some experts, analyzing the tortuous process of family planning work, believe that involving the population issue in political struggles was a major mistake. In the early days of the founding of the People's Republic, in response to the U.S. Secretary of State Acheson's claim that China's population problem could not be solved regardless of who ruled, we proposed that "more people are a good thing." If this was used as a political struggle need to boost morale, it can be understood; but if under this slogan, family planning work was neglected, problems would arise. In 1957, during the Anti-Rightist Movement, scholars like Ma Yinchu, who advocated population control, were criticized, and the good momentum of the just-started family planning work was suppressed. During the Cultural Revolution, family planning work was severely impacted, and the organization was paralyzed. It was not until the early 1970s that Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai emphasized the need to control the population again, and the work was freed from the political whirlpool. But this mistake had already formed two unprecedented peaks of high fertility in the world, and the population increased by 300 million in 20 years.

In analyzing the causes of the population doubling stage, some experts believe that this was formed in a very short period under special conditions and a special environment. Everyone, including decision-makers, had a process of recognizing this sudden impact.

After the founding of New China, the socialist system determined that the government must take measures to improve the long-term backward medical and health conditions. In a few years, the death rate of 20‰ in 1949 was reduced to 10.8‰ in 1957. Since 1973, it has been maintained below 7.5‰, entering the ranks of countries with low death rates in the world; the natural population growth rate increased from 16‰ in 1949 to 24‰ in 1954, reaching a peak of 33.33‰ in 1963. The population growth of the whole country changed from the pre-liberation "high birth rate, high death rate, low growth rate" to "high birth rate, low death rate, high growth rate," the speed of which was unprecedented in history.

Experts believe that population growth has its own laws of motion. For example, the state repeatedly emphasized the prohibition of the third child, but the results of the 1988 sample survey showed that the rate of three children and more was controlled below 10% in 9 provinces and cities; it exceeded 20% in 10 provinces and autonomous regions, with the highest province reaching 45.15%; the national natural population growth rate rose from 10.81‰ in 1984 to 16.16‰. Why, after implementing the family planning policy for a decade or two, did the natural growth rate still rise? Why did the rate of multiple births in some regions not decrease? And why did many economically developed countries in the West achieve a balance between death rate and birth rate without government intervention in childbirth?

Some statistical data show that economic development and population growth seem to have an interesting relationship. Countries with a per capita GDP of less than $750 experience rapid population growth with economic development, while countries exceeding $750 may experience a decrease in population growth. Domestically, a per capita GDP of around 1,400 yuan is a dividing line. For example, in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, where the per capita GDP is over 2,000 yuan, the average birth rate increased from 13.9‰ in 1985 to 16.48‰ in 1987, and the total fertility rate of women of childbearing age was maintained below 2.1, with a strong ability to withstand the impact of population growth waves; in Qinghai, Yunnan, and Henan, where the per capita GDP is below 700 yuan, the average birth rate in 1985 was 14.17‰, and the birth rate surged to 25.19‰ in 1987 after a slight relaxation in family planning work, with an average total fertility rate of 2.99.

Culture and education, especially the cultural level of women, are closely related to the birth rate. A sample survey of 50-year-old women in China illustrates this problem: illiterate women have an average of 5.86 children, those with primary school education have an average of 4.80, those with junior high school education have 3.74, those with senior high school education have 2.85, and those with college education have 2.05. Women with education have a higher employment rate, receive more education, are more likely to master scientific knowledge of childbirth and contraception, are more likely to break free from clan and traditional concepts, and can more consciously practice late marriage and family planning.

The Survival and Development of the Entire Nation

Can the population be controlled? Whether the survival space and conditions of the Chinese nation can be protected depends on the efforts of the present and the next few decades.

This is the upward trend of the number of women of childbearing age in China: in 1985, the number of women of childbearing age (15-49 years old) was 276.7 million, in 1990 it was 310.4 million, in 1995 it was 329.5 million, and in 2000 it reached 339.4 million. Looking at the most fertile age group, in 1985 it was 93.899 million, in 1988 it exceeded 100 million, in 1992 it reached a peak of 124 million, and it will remain above 100 million until the end of the century.

The Party Central Committee, the National People's Congress, and the State Council took decisive measures before the third peak of childbirth arrived. In March 1978, the state included family planning as a basic right and obligation of every citizen in the Constitution; in September 1982, the Party Central Committee made implementing family planning a basic state policy; the government, according to different situations in cities, rural areas, and ethnic minorities, improved the family planning policy.

Under this situation, a large number of couples of childbearing age responded to the call, shared the worries of the state, and solved the difficulties of the nation. According to the 1988 survey and estimation, there are 28 million couples nationwide with only one child certificate, and the contraception rate of married women of childbearing age has reached 71.2%. Among the current 206 million married women nationwide, 147 million couples have taken various contraceptive measures.

There are 10 million enthusiastic people from all walks of life nationwide who participate in the grassroots organizations of the Family Planning Association. They, through activities such as "member contact households" and "member homes," propagate and educate the masses, and carry out services such as helping the masses to get rich. The grassroots cadre team dedicated to family planning work is growing.

Some local governments have taken positive and effective measures to address the problems in family planning work. Some counties in Sichuan Province have combined poverty alleviation work with family planning to change the situation of "the poorer, the more children, the more children, the poorer." Wenzhou City in Zhejiang Province has established the "Daughter's House Fund," and Anfu County in Jiangxi Province has fully implemented the "two-daughter household" sterilization and old-age insurance to eliminate the worries of the masses...

However, there are indeed many people who, at the critical moment when the state and nation are overcoming the population growth crisis, forget that they are Communist Party members, state cadres, and forget the responsibilities and obligations that every citizen should fulfill.

The assistant to the township head of Beihai Township, Dalian City, fearing that his property would have no one to inherit, took his wife and fled to have a third child; a brigade leader in a certain county in Anhui Province used backdoor deals and falsified documents to claim that his son, who was physically and mentally healthy, was "disabled," and then had another child; a district leader in a certain city in Henan Province, at the age of 53, had a sixth child...

In Henan's Huaxian County, although the regulations for selecting advanced individuals and promoting cadres clearly stipulate the "one-veto power" for family planning, two farmers in Laodian Township, one with 7 children and the other with 9, were elected as village heads due to their skills and became rich. Some were even awarded the title of "Farmer Entrepreneur" and elected as county political consultants. Who would have thought that these two farmers who became cadres gave birth to the 8th and 10th children last year, which had a very bad influence.

Fining supernumerary births is a means of implementing contraceptive policies, but in some places, this is treated as an end. The rich buy birth permits with money, the poor go out to "stealthily give birth," and some people treat birth permits as currency, selling them for thousands of yuan each...

Some local cadres yield to backward traditional forces. They dare not ask about early marriage and childbirth, and they turn a blind eye to those who insist on having multiple children until they have a son. The proportion of women under 20 years old who got married in 1987 was 19.9%, an increase of 4.5 percentage points from the 15.4% in the 1982 census; the number of multiple births nationwide is about 3 million each year.

Our country and nation can no longer afford the chaos of population control mistakes. The editorial department of this newspaper receives at least dozens of letters from the masses every day, reflecting problems and making suggestions. People demand the legal management of the "supernumerary guerrilla troops" among the floating population; suggest the speedy formulation of family planning regulations; ask why those who cannot even implement the family planning policy are still in the cadre team and in the Party; demand the severe punishment of those who use family planning work for personal gain and profit; suggest strengthening the management of fines; demand the adoption of effective measures to eliminate the worries of "single-child households" and "five-guarantee households"; suggest strengthening the education of contraceptive knowledge in rural areas and the research of contraceptive measures; demand the improvement of the distribution of contraceptive tools; call for the elimination of fraud in childbirth work; demand the cleanup of "black children" who dare not register their households due to supernumerary births; suggest the formulation of specific policies corresponding to the new situations that have emerged in the reform and opening up...

We are in the most significant period of change in Chinese history. At this critical moment, the population issue has put us in an unprecedented predicament. At the time when the 1.1 billion population alarm is sounded nationwide, we end this article with a quote from an expert: "Inform the people of the truth, enlighten the masses with great principles, and thereby arouse the people's sense of crisis in survival, the nation's sense of crisis, the urgency of reform, and the historical responsibility. The deepest source of China's modernization power lies in the understanding and practice of the people."

　　警钟：十一亿人口！
　　——我国计划生育工作面面观
    本报记者　谢联辉
    自从１９８７年７月１１日“世界５０亿人口日”之后，时间每向前推进一分钟，地球上的人口净增１５０人。
    整个地球敲响了控制人口的警钟，特别是人口最多的我国，来自人口的压力已影响到国家的发展、民族的生存。
    城市一座座住宅楼拔地而起，乡村一幢幢新房鳞次栉比，人们还在叫：住得太挤；
    汽车、电车、火车，已经堵塞了许多交通线路，人们还是说坐车难。
    …………
    人，人，人！人口压力已成为当今中国许多社会问题的根源之一。
　值得注意的人口承载极限
    地球最大人口容量是多少？中华大地对人口有多大的承载能力？
    有的专家认为：全球人口不应该超过１０亿，现在人口已经使生态环境严重失去平衡，后果不堪设想。
    多数学者认为：１１０亿左右是世界维持合理健康而不算奢侈生活的人口限度。按目前的人口增长速度，世界人口达到人类生存的这个临界线，至多五六十年。
    我国的人口形势比世界其它地区更严峻。５０年代和１９６２—１９７５年两次生育高峰形成了倍增特大人口台阶，今后几十年总人口增长最高值将是多少？关键要看计划生育工作的状况。专家分析，如果我们的工作做得扎实，总和生育率保持在更替水平上，总人口最高峰可以控制在１５亿；假定按目前生育水平（育龄妇女总和生育率为２．３—２．４）趋势发展，到下世纪中叶将达到１７—１８亿；要是工作有失误，总人口增长最高峰将超过２０亿，可能给整个民族带来灾难性恶果。
    这还不是问题的全部，伴随总人口增长高峰出现的还有老年人口增长高峰、劳动年龄人口增长高峰。据专家们用目的方法预测，现在我国老龄化开始加快，下世纪２０年代会高速老化。在２０００年，６０岁以上的老年人口将增加到１．２９——１．３５亿。有人估计老年人口高峰将突破３亿的大关。关于劳动年龄人口，农村就业问题相当突出。据抽样调查，１９８７年到２０００年的１４年间，全国平均每年退出劳动年龄的农村人口不足７００万人，而进入劳动年龄的却超过１８００万人，累计到２０００年将净增１亿人以上，务农劳动力总数将超过３．５亿人，而种植业仅需１．６亿人，１．９亿剩余劳动力需向非农业转移。
    中国科学院国情分析研究课题小组的专家研究指出，人口三大高峰相继来临并叠加，将加剧已经日益紧张的人口、粮食、资源、环境、能源之间的矛盾。
    民以食为天。粮食的多少受到耕地面积数量制约。虽然我国土地产出率增加较快，１９８５年比１９６１年单产提高２７４．８％，远高于世界的平均水平，但因人口需求总量大，只能维持在温饱水平。这个水平能否保持到本世纪末，还得看我国农业投入、控制人口增长和防止乱占耕地面积的情况，其形势十分严峻。
    有些专家分析，三大人口高峰对生态、资源等的巨大压力，留给我们及后代的回旋余地相当狭小。我国经济供给、资源承载的最大人口临界点有人估计在１５亿，其时如果不能逐步实现死亡率与出生率相对持平，中华民族的前景不容乐观。
　制约人口控制的种种因素
    这种严峻的局面是怎样形成的？
    有些专家从计划生育工作经历的曲折过程分析，过去把人口问题卷入政治斗争是一大失误。建国初期，针对美国的艾奇逊所谓中国人口问题不管是谁统治也解决不了，我们提出“人多是好事”。如果把这作为一种政治斗争的需要，鼓舞人们士气，这可以理解；倘若在这个口号下，忽视节育工作，就会出问题。１９５７年反右时，批判了主张控制人口的马寅初等学者，把刚开始的计划生育工作好势头压了下去。“文革”造反时期，计划生育工作受到冲击，机构瘫痪。直到７０年代初，毛泽东、周恩来再次强调要控制人口，才从政治漩涡摆脱出来。但这种失误已在全国形成两次世界罕见的生育高峰，２０多年中人口增加３亿。
    在分析人口倍增特大台阶成因时，有的专家认为这是在特殊条件、特殊环境下极短时间内形成的，每个人包括决策者在内，对这个突如其来的冲击，都有个认识过程。
    新中国一成立，社会主义制度决定了政府必须采取措施，改善长期落后的医疗卫生条件。几年功夫，使１９４９年的死亡率２０‰，降到１９５７年的１０．８‰，自１９７３年起，一直维持在７．５‰以下，进入世界低死亡率行列；人口自然增长率由１９４９年的１６‰上升到１９５４年的２４‰，最高的１９６３年竟达３３．３３‰。全国人口增长由建国前的“高出生率、高死亡率、低增长率”变为“高出生率、低死亡率、高增长率”，来势之快，史无前例。
    专家认为，人口增长有它自身的运动规律。比如国家一再强调杜绝第三胎，但１９８８年抽样调查结果却表明，三胎和三胎以上的多孩率，控制在１０％以下的有９个省市；超过２０％的有１０个省、自治区，最高省区达４５．１５％；全国人口自然增长率由１９８４年的１０．８１‰，回升到１６．１６‰。为什么我国实行计划生育政策一二十年，自然增长率还会回升？一些地区的多胎率为什么降不下来？而许多西方经济发达国家，政府并没有对生育进行干预，就实现了死亡率与出生率持平？
    有些统计资料表明，经济发展与人口增长好象有一种有趣的关系。人均国民收入在７５０美元以下的国家，在经济发展的同时，人口增长很快，而超过７５０美元的国家，经济增长人口可能降低。国内，人均国民收入１４００元左右，是一条界限。比如京津沪，人均国民收入在２０００元以上，平均出生率由第三次生育高峰期到来前１９８５年的１３．９‰，上升到进入高峰期１９８７年的１６．４８‰，平均育龄妇女总和生育率保持在２．１以下，耐受人口增长浪潮冲击能力较强；青海、云南、河南，人均国民收入在７００元以下，１９８５年平均出生率为１４．１７‰，节育工作稍一放松，１９８７年猛增到２５．１９‰，平均育龄妇女总和生育率达２．９９。
    文化教育特别是女性的文化水平，与生育率有密切关系。我国对５０岁妇女的一次抽样调查比较说明这个问题：文盲妇女平均生育５．８６个孩子，小学文化程度的平均生育４．８０个，初中文化水平的生育３．７４个，高中文化水平的生育２．８５个，大学文化水平的生育２．０５个。有文化的妇女就业比例高，受教育多，容易掌握生育科学知识、避孕方法，容易摆脱宗族、传统观念的束缚，能较自觉地晚婚、节育。
　事关全民族的生存与发展
    人口能不能控制，中华民族的生存空间、生存条件能否得到保护，就决定于现在和今后几十年的努力。
    这是我国育龄妇女人数上升趋势：１９８５年，我国１５—４９岁育龄妇女人数为２．７６７亿，１９９０年为３．１０４亿，１９９５年为３．２９５亿，２０００年达３．３９４亿。再看生育最旺盛的年龄段，１９８５年为９３８９．９万人，１９８８年超过１亿，１９９２年达高峰１．２４亿，直到本世纪末都在１亿人以上。
    党中央、全国人大、国务院在人口第三次生育高峰来到之前，就采取了坚决的措施。１９７８年３月，国家把计划生育作为每个公民的一项基本权利和义务，载入宪法；１９８２年９月，党中央把实行计划生育作为一项基本国策；政府根据城市、农村、民族等不同情况，完善了计划生育政策。
    就在这种形势下，一大批育龄夫妇响应号召，为国家分忧，为民族解难。据１９８８年调查推算，全国共有２８００万对夫妇领有独生子女证，已婚育龄妇女的节育率达７１．２％，在当前全国２．０６亿已婚妇女中，有１．４７亿对夫妇采取了各种避孕措施。
    全国有１０００万名热心计划生育工作的各界人士，参加计划生育协会基层组织。他们通过“会员联系户”、“会员之家”等活动，向群众进行宣传教育，开展帮助群众脱贫致富等服务。献身于计划生育工作的基层干部队伍在增长。
    一些地方政府针对当地计划生育工作的问题，采取了积极有效措施。四川省一些县把扶贫工作同计划生育结合起来，改变“越穷越生，越生越穷”的状况；浙江省温州市创办“女儿户基金会”，江西省安远县全面推行“二女户”结扎养老保险，以解除群众的后顾之忧……
    然而，也确实有不少人，在国家、民族度过人口增长危机的关键时刻，忘记了自己是共产党员、是国家干部，忘记了每个公民应尽的责任和义务。
    大连市旅顺口区北海乡有位乡长助理怕自己的财产没有儿子继承，携妻出走超生第３胎；安徽省某县一位场长，走后门弄虚作假，把自己智力、身体发育健全的儿子说成“残废”，再生一个；河南省某市一位区领导，５３岁又生第６胎……
    河南滑县对于评选先进、提拔干部明明制定“计划生育一票否决权”规定，可老店乡两位农民，一个生了７胎、一个生了９胎，却因一技之长致富当上了正副村长，有的还授予“农民企业家”、选为县政协委员。哪晓得这两位当上干部的农民，去年一个生第８胎、一个生第１０胎，影响极坏。
    对超生者处以罚款本是实行节育政策的一种手段，可是有些地区把这当作目的，有钱者用钱买生育指标，无钱者外出“偷生”，还有的人把准生证当作货币，每张出价千元……
    有些地方干部屈服于落后的传统势力。对于早婚早育者不敢过问，对于“不生儿子不罢休”的多生者，睁只眼闭只眼。全国不满２０周岁妇女结婚人数，占当年结婚总人数的比例，１９８７年为１９．９％，比１９８２年人口普查的１５．４竟上升了４．５个百分点；全国近几年每年出生多孩人数约３００万。
    我们国家、我们民族再也经不起控制人口失误的折腾了。本报编辑部每天至少收到几十封群众来信，反映问题，提出建议。人们要求依法管理流动人口中“超生游击队”；建议尽快制定计划生育法规；提出为什么还要把那些连计划生育政策都不能实行的人留在干部队伍里、留在党内；要求严惩利用计划生育工作营私舞弊、牟取暴利的人；建议加强罚款办法的管理；要求采取有效办法解除“独女户”、“五保户”的后顾之忧；建议加强农村避孕知识教育，加强避孕措施的科研工作；要求改善避孕工具的发放工作；呼吁杜绝生育工作中的弄虚作假；要求清理超生不敢报户口的“黑孩子”；要求针对改革开放中出现的新情况制定相应的具体政策……人们对各级政府、计划生育部门提出了越来越高的要求。
    我们正处在中国历史上最伟大的变革时期。在这关键时刻，人口问题把我们置于一种前所未有的困境之中。在全国敲响１１亿人口警钟之际，这里引用专家的一段话作本文的结束语：“告民以实情，晓众喻大义，由此唤起民众生存的危机感、民族的忧患感、改革的紧迫感和历史的责任感。中国现代化伟力之最深厚的根源存在于民众的理解和实践之中。”（附图片）
