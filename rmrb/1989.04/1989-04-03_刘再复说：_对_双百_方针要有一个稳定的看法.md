Today, when we implement the "Hundred Flowers, Hundred Schools" policy, we must respect the independent spirit and independent mind of individuals. What does it mean to respect intellectuals? Respecting their knowledge and scholarship is correct; but the most fundamental aspect is respecting their independent minds. Only by respecting their independent minds can they engage in creative work. Intellectuals' sense of responsibility to society and their historical mission first manifest as their having independent views on society. They dare to express their scientific views, believing that their views can be considered by society, the nation, and humanity, and are beneficial to social progress.

Society respects the independent minds of intellectuals, and intellectuals use their independent minds to care about society, taking a responsible attitude towards society. Therefore, I feel that after discussing the "Hundred Flowers, Hundred Schools" policy for so long, through several ups and downs, the key is still to learn from past experiences and lessons. We should approach the "Hundred Flowers, Hundred Schools" policy with a mature, healthy mindset and broad-mindedness, rather than with a pathological mentality. We should think about the "Hundred Flowers, Hundred Schools" policy in a mature and healthy way, and we should have a stable view. This stable view, in my opinion, should at least include two points: first, respecting the independent minds of intellectuals; second, acknowledging that "Hundred Flowers, Hundred Schools" is pluralistic, acknowledging the pluralism of cultural structures and literary research structures, etc. It is not one or two, but "hundred." We should not have a single dominant view. The pursuit of truth is for the better progress of humanity. In the face of truth, everyone is equal, and individuals should have a transcendent character.

### 刘再复说：  对“双百”方针要有一个稳定的看法

　　刘再复说：
    对“双百”方针要有一个稳定的看法
    我们今天贯彻“双百”方针，就是要尊重人独立的精神、独立的心灵。所谓对知识分子的尊重，尊重什么呢？尊重他的知识，尊重他的学问，这都没错；但最根本的是尊重他独立的心灵。只有尊重他独立的心灵，他才有可能进行创造性的劳动。知识分子对社会的责任感、对历史的使命感，首先表现为他对社会有自己独立的见解。他敢于把自己科学的见解发表出来，相信他的见解可供社会、民族和人类思考，有利于社会进步。
    社会尊重知识分子独立的心灵，知识分子用独立的心灵来关心社会，很负责任地对待社会。所以我觉得今天对“双百”方针谈了这么多，这么久，经过几沉几浮、几兴几衰，关键还是应该吸取过去的经验教训，应该以一种成熟健康的心态和博大的胸襟，而不是用病态思维来对待“双百”方针，对“双百”方针要进行成熟、健康的思考，而且应该有一个稳定的看法。这种稳定的看法，我认为至少包括两点：一、尊重知识分子独立的心灵；二、必须承认“双百”是多元的，承认文化结构、文学研究结构等的多元性。不是一，也不是二，而是“百”。不能搞一言独尊。探索真理是为了人类更好地进步，在真理面前人人平等，个人在真理面前应该有一种超拔的品格。
