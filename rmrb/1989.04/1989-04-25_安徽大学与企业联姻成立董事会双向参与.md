Anhui University and enterprises have formed a joint board for mutual participation, creating a new mechanism where both the school and the enterprises actively engage.

The board, composed of 22 enterprises, actively supports the school's operations. In return, the school proactively serves the enterprises' production needs. This new mechanism is taking shape.

The Anhui University Board of Directors was established at the end of last year. According to the board's charter, the member enterprises will participate in formulating the school's development plans, review major school matters, and evaluate the school's work. They will also provide funding and materials to support the school's development. The school's main responsibilities include: prioritizing the placement of graduates in member enterprises, training specialized personnel according to the enterprises' needs, conducting scientific research, and prioritizing the transfer of technological achievements to the enterprises.

Since its establishment four months ago, the board has achieved initial success.

Currently, the 22 member enterprises have provided the school with 700,000 yuan in educational funds and a batch of materials needed for school construction. The school, in turn, has provided high-quality scientific and technological services.
