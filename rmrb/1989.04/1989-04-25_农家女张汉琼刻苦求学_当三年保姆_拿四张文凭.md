A young woman from a farming family in Wuhan County, Ninggang Township, Zhang Hanqiong, worked as a domestic helper for three years and obtained four diplomas.

In recent years, the young farmer Zhang Hanqiong's family has managed 70 mu of orange groves, becoming a well-known "ten-thousand-yuan household" in the area. However, she has always wanted to learn high-yield orange cultivation techniques. Coincidentally, the Wuhan County Science and Technology Commission was looking for a domestic helper for Professor Zhang Wenchai, a renowned citrus expert from Huazhong Agricultural University. Zhang Hanqiong saw this as a good opportunity to learn and successfully applied to be the domestic helper for Professor Zhang Wenchai. In Professor Zhang's home, she efficiently completed her chores and seized every opportunity to ask Professor Zhang for advice. After three years, Zhang Hanqiong completed courses from the provincial fruit tree correspondence middle school and the Chinese Association for Science and Technology's correspondence university program in fruit tree cultivation. She also participated in the Jinling Alumni Science and Technology Training Class and the training class on nutrient diagnosis and formula fertilization for agricultural and sideline products, all with excellent results.

　　农家女张汉琼刻苦求学    
    当三年保姆　拿四张文凭
    本报讯  湖北省武昌县宁港乡女青年张汉琼当３年保姆之后，拿回了四张“文凭”。
    这些年，青年农民张汉琼家里经营了７０亩柑桔园，成为远近闻名的“万元户”，但她一心想学习柑桔高产技术。正巧武昌县科委在为华中农业大学教授、全国著名柑桔专家章文才物色保姆，张汉琼觉得这是一个求学的好机会。她终于应聘当上章文才家的保姆。在章教授家里，她麻利地干完活，抓紧机会向章教授请教。三年过去，张汉琼先后学完了省果树函校中专和中国科协致富技术函校大学果树栽培专业的课程，还参加了金陵校友科技培训班、农副产品营养诊断与配方施肥培训班的学习，均取得良好成绩。　　　　　　　　　　　　（兰鲍）
