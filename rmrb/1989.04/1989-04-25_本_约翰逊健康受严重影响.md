Ben Johnson's Health Severely Affected

People's Daily, Ottawa, April 24th - Correspondent Guo Wenfu reports: The renowned sports physician Scott, who once treated Ben Johnson, revealed that due to the use of steroids and similar stimulants, Ben Johnson's health has been severely affected. This "world's fastest man" may not have fully paid the price for his title.

Scott responded to a reporter's question yesterday, stating that last May, when he was treating Ben Johnson, he discovered that the athlete was already suffering from severe side effects caused by steroids. "Sometimes you see him as a very polite and good person, which I think is his inherent nature, but at other times, you can see that a large amount of testosterone makes him very aggressive." Observing Ben Johnson's performance after winning at the Seoul Olympic Stadium: "He hardly showed any joy for the record he created."

Scott said that the steroids Ben Johnson took to enhance his muscles may lead to cancer, infertility, and heart disease. Doctors usually monitor the patient's blood pressure, kidney, and liver function after prescribing such drugs to ensure no side effects occur. However, Ben Johnson's personal physician, Astefan, admitted that he never performed such observations, "especially for Ben Johnson."

Additionally, Scott strongly criticized Astefan as one of the most intimate people around Ben Johnson, describing him as "greedy, reckless, and jealous." Even if they eventually admit to giving Ben Johnson various stimulants, they will not admit to making any mistakes in Seoul.

　　本·约翰逊健康受严重影响
    本报渥太华４月２４日电  记者郭文福报道：曾经为本·约翰逊治过病的著名体育医生斯考特透露，由于服用类固醇之类的兴奋剂，本·约翰逊的健康已受到严重影响，而这位“世界第一飞人”为了这个尊称的最终代价可能尚未付出。
    斯考特昨天在回答记者提问时说，去年５月他在为本·约翰逊治疗时发现，这位运动员已经遭受着严重的类固醇产生的副作用。“有时你看到他是一个很有礼貌很好的人，我想这是他本来的特性，但另外的时候你却能看到大量的睾丸激素使他变得十分粗暴”。再观察本·约翰逊在汉城奥运会体育场获胜后的表现：“他几乎没有为自己所创造的成绩感到高兴”。
    斯考特说，本·约翰逊服用的增强肌肉的类固醇可能导致癌、不育症和心脏病。医生开这种药以后，通常要观察病人的血压、肾和肝的功能，以保证不出现副作用，但本·约翰逊的私人医生阿斯特凡承认他从不作这种观察，“特别是对本·约翰逊”。
    另外，斯考特强烈批评阿斯特凡是本·约翰逊周围最亲近的几个人“贪婪、不顾后果和妒忌”，纵然他们最终会承认给了本·约翰逊各种兴奋剂，也不会承认他们在汉城犯过什么错误。
