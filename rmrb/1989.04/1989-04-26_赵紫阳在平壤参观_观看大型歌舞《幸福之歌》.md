Zhao Ziyang Visits Pyongyang and Watches the Large-Scale Song and Dance "Song of Happiness"

BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Zhao Ziyang, and his delegation braved the rain this afternoon to visit the newly constructed Kwangbok Street, Chongnyu Street, and Rungrado May Day Stadium in Pyongyang. They expressed their congratulations on the achievements made by the Korean people in their construction efforts.

Li Chong-yom, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and Vice President of the State, who had just returned from an overseas visit, specially accompanied Zhao Ziyang and his delegation on the entire tour.

Kwangbok Street, Chongnyu Street, and Rungrado May Day Stadium are the largest urban construction projects undertaken by Korea since its founding. The investment amounts to 2.7 billion US dollars, with a total of 260 major facilities.

At 3:30 PM, Zhao Ziyang and his delegation first visited the circus and youth palace on Kwangbok Street. Zhao Ziyang inquired in detail about the scale of Kwangbok Street. When the chief engineer, Kim Pyong-ho, introduced that the main street of Kwangbok Street is 6 kilometers long, 100 meters wide, and the total building area on both sides is over 5.5 million square meters, Zhao Ziyang exclaimed, "That's quite a scale!"

The Chongnyu Street, located on the east side of Kwangbok Street, has 9 gymnasiums and a football field, hence it is also known as the Anku Sports Village.

During the visit to the table tennis hall, the Korean national table tennis team was in intense training. Zhao Ziyang waved to the athletes and wished them hard training and good results.

The Rungrado May Day Stadium, located on the Yodok Island in the Taedong River, was the last stop of the delegation's visit today. The Rungrado May Day Stadium has a unique design and a grand scale, covering an area of 400,000 square meters and can accommodate 150,000 spectators.

The stadium looks like a parachute dropped into the Taedong River from a distance, and it also resembles a large lotus flower. After the host introduced that the stadium was completed in just two and a half years, Zhao Ziyang praised, "That's fast!"

After the visit, Zhao Ziyang wrote in the guest book: "The flower blooming on the banks of the Taedong River, the pride of the Korean people."

Along the way today, Zhao Ziyang and his delegation were warmly welcomed by thousands of people and passersby.

At the farewell, Zhao Ziyang, holding Li Chong-yom's hand, said, "You just got off the plane and haven't rested yet, but you specially accompanied me. Thank you!"

Today, those who accompanied Zhao Ziyang and his delegation on the visit also included Xu Zhen, Choi Kwang, Kim Yong-sun, Cha Bong-chul, and Zhu Changjun.

　　赵紫阳在平壤参观    
    观看大型歌舞《幸福之歌》
    本报平壤４月２６日电  记者徐宝康周必忠报道：中共中央总书记赵紫阳一行今天下午冒雨兴致勃勃地来到平壤新建的光复大街、青春大街和绫罗岛体育场，对朝鲜人民在建设中取得的成就表示祝贺。
    刚刚出国访问归来的朝鲜劳动党中央政治局委员、国家副主席李钟玉特意陪同赵紫阳一行全程参观。
    平壤光复大街、青春大街、绫罗岛体育场等新建筑，是朝鲜建国以来实施的一项最大市政建设工程。投资２７亿美元，主要建筑设施达２６０项。
    下午３时３０分，赵紫阳一行先后来到光复大街的杂技馆和少年宫。赵紫阳详细询问了光复大街的规模等情况。当工程建设总指挥金奉浩介绍说，光复大街主要街道长６公里，宽１００米，两侧建筑总面积为５５０多万平方米，赵紫阳感叹道：“规模不小啊！”。
    位于光复大街东侧的青春大街有９个体育馆、一座足球场，因此人们又称这里为安谷体育村。
    赵紫阳一行在参观乒乓球馆时，朝鲜国家乒乓球队正在紧张训练。赵紫阳向运动员挥手，祝愿他们刻苦训练，取得好成绩。
    座落在大同江绫罗岛上的绫罗岛体育场是赵紫阳一行今天参观的最后一个项目。绫罗岛体育场造型独特，规模宏大，占地４０万平方米，可容纳１５万观众。
    这座体育场远看像一顶落在大同江中的降落伞，又酷似一朵大莲花。当主人介绍这座体育场只用两年半就建设起来之后，赵紫阳称赞说：“很快啊”。
    参观后，赵紫阳在留言簿上题词：“大同江畔盛开的花朵，朝鲜人民的骄傲。”
    在今天的参观沿途，赵紫阳一行受到数千群众和过路行人的热烈欢迎。
    告别时，赵紫阳握着李钟玉的手说，“你刚下飞机还没有休息，就专程陪我，谢谢！”
    今天陪同赵紫阳一行参观的还有许锬、崔光、金勇舜、车凤柱和朱昌骏。
    据新华社平壤４月２５日电　（记者朱克川）赵紫阳总书记今天晚上在金日成主席的陪同下观看了朝鲜大型歌舞《幸福之歌》。
    今天的演出是在平壤市内最大的剧场“二·八文化会馆”举行的，《幸福之歌》是目前朝鲜规模最大的舞台艺术，参加演出的演员有５０００人。演员们出色的表演，博得了中国客人和全场观众一阵阵的掌声。
