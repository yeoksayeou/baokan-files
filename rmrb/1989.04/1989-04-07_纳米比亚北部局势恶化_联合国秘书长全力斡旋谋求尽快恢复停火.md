The situation in northern Namibia has deteriorated. The United Nations Secretary-General is making every effort to mediate and seek an early restoration of the ceasefire.

BEIJING, April 5 (Xinhua) — The United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar is making every effort to mediate and seek an early restoration of the ceasefire in Namibia to prevent the independence process from being obstructed.

United Nations spokesman Giulio Maria Napolitano said today that Pérez de Cuéllar has offered "some opinions" to his special representative in Namibia, Martti Ahtisaari, and the United Nations Under-Secretary-General in Angola, Brian Urquhart, regarding the restoration of the ceasefire in northern Namibia.

Pérez de Cuéllar has also maintained close contact with the President of the Security Council, representatives of the Frontline States, and the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) to discuss the restoration of the ceasefire in Namibia.

Napolitano said that Pérez de Cuéllar is also trying to quickly dispatch 3,700 more United Nations peacekeeping troops to Namibia, where only 900 have arrived so far.

Since April 1, South African forces and SWAPO guerrillas have been engaged in armed clashes in northern Namibia, resulting in approximately 200 deaths. Napolitano said that the formal ceasefire, which was supposed to begin at dawn on April 1, has been violated, but he refused to specify which side is responsible for the incident.

South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha sent a letter to Pérez de Cuéllar yesterday, accusing SWAPO of sending more than 1,000 armed personnel across the Namibia-Angola border since April 1, attempting to establish a base within Namibia. He also threatened that if the Secretary-General does not take "active and effective measures to stop the rapid deterioration of the situation," the entire peace process in Namibia will face collapse.

The United Nations African Group issued a statement yesterday, saying that SWAPO fighters did not infiltrate from Angola into Namibia, but were already in northern Namibia and were attacked by South African forces, leading to the conflict. The African Group also criticized Ahtisaari for agreeing to allow South African forces to leave their base to continue "slaughtering" Namibians.

The Angolan permanent representative to the United Nations also accused South Africa of one-sided statements at a press conference today and suggested the formation of a joint investigation team consisting of Angola, Cuba, the United States, and the Soviet Union to investigate and clarify the facts.

　　纳米比亚北部局势恶化
    联合国秘书长全力斡旋谋求尽快恢复停火
    本报联合国４月５日电  记者刘开宸报道：联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔正在全力斡旋，争取纳米比亚尽快恢复停火，以免纳米比亚独立进程受阻。
    联合国发言人朱利亚尼今天在这里对新闻界说，德奎利亚尔已向他在纳米比亚的特别代表阿赫蒂萨里和在安哥拉的联合国副秘书长戈尔丁提出了关于在纳米比亚北部恢复停火的“一些意见”。
    德奎利亚尔还与安理会主席、非洲前线国家和西南非洲人民组织代表保持密切的接触，商谈在纳米比亚恢复停火之事。
    朱利亚尼说，德奎利亚尔还在设法尽快地再派３７００名联合国维持和平部队到纳米比亚，目前只有９００名到达那里。
    ４月１日起，南非军队与西南非洲人民组织游击队在纳米比亚北部发生武装冲突，迄未停止，死亡约２００人。朱利亚尼说，双方同意于４月１日清晨开始的正式停火遭到破坏，但他拒绝说明哪一方应对此事件负责。
    南非外交部长皮克·博塔昨天致函德奎利亚尔，指责西南非洲人民组织１０００多名武装人员自４月１日起越过纳米比亚-安哥拉边界，企图在纳米比亚境内建立基地。他还威胁说，如秘书长“不采取积极有效的措施制止局势迅速恶化，纳米比亚的整个和平进程将面临崩溃”。
    联合国非洲国家集团昨天发表公报称，西南非洲人民组织战士并未从安哥拉渗透到纳米比亚，而是他们已经在纳米比亚北部，是遭到南非军队袭击、被迫自卫而引起冲突的。非洲国家集团还批评阿赫蒂萨里同意南非军队离开基地去继续“屠杀”纳米比亚人。
    安哥拉常驻联合国代表今天还在这里的记者招待会上指责南非的一面之词，并建议成立安哥拉、古巴、美国和苏联的联合调查团去调查，以明真相。
