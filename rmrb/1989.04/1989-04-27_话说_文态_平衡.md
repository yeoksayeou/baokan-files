Title: On the Balance of "Literary Attitudes"
Author: Lei Shuyan

I received a complimentary book, and upon seeing the title, it was a popular novel. The author's name was unfamiliar to me. Who was it? Upon flipping to the dedication page and carefully examining the signature, I realized it was a well-known writer friend from the contemporary literary scene.

Writers either do not wish to, or are reluctant to, or dare not write popular novels. If they do write them, they use a pseudonym. Why is this? In recent years, writers' thoughts have been greatly liberated, and various schools of thought have raised their banners and formed their own factions. Flipping through various magazines and books, one can see that the literary scene is quite lively. The only regret is that it is difficult to publish books, due to low sales. Publishers have endured many criticisms for this; magazine publishers, due to low sales and large losses, are also lamenting. Outsiders reflect a cold attitude, saying that nowadays, only poets and aspiring poets read poetry; those who read novels are mostly friends in the literary circle and critics.

Literature has, in reality, built a fortress and a Great Wall for itself within the literary circle. Imagine, in such a vast country, printing a few thousand copies of a book or magazine, who will it reach?

But this is only one aspect of the problem. On the other hand, there is a vast book market and a hungry readership for popular literature. This group of readers is the darling of the commodity economy. They travel by train and ship for business, and the long hours of boredom on the journey need stimulating and interesting reading material to fill the time. A large number of individual business owners, as well as farmers who have moved from the countryside to work in cities, also need to find some interesting reading material to pass their leisure time. This group of readers is a formidable group. They have plenty of time, are willing to spend money, and have a very good appetite for consumption, but unfortunately, their cultural level is relatively low. (I have not yet counted those readers with a higher cultural level who also need recreational reading material.) In recent years, the waves of popularity in popular literature, such as martial arts, social news, and some erotic literature, have mostly been stirred up by them; martial arts, social news, and some erotic literature are very popular among them.

Supply and demand have created a contradiction.

"Serious" writers, holding onto "serious" literature, seriously complain about and observe the serious decline of "serious" literature.

Hungry readers are becoming increasingly desperate.

Thus, "illegal publications" first seized the opportunity and filled the void; then, bestsellers from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and abroad confidently entered the market. Society was filled with criticism, blaming publishers, blaming bestsellers, and blaming small bookstalls. The criticism is justified! But upon closer inspection, these readers with low cultural levels, who have no intention of reading serious books or cannot understand serious books, but who are also wealthy, have plenty of time and energy, how will they spend their surplus time? Fighting and causing trouble? Wouldn't that be more harmful to society?

After the ecological balance is disrupted, revenge is well-known. Now, using this phrase, it is called "literary attitude" imbalance.

It is obviously not feasible to not provide reading material for readers who like to read popular works or can only read popular works. Without steamed buns and not liking high-end pastries, customers can only look for "steamed bread rolls." Eating too many nutritionally deficient foods, and high-end pastries appear in surplus.

I have always believed that "serious" writers might as well put down their pretensions and write some healthy, interesting, and reader-friendly popular works, naturally driving out and replacing the vulgar reading materials from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and abroad. Just putting down pretensions is not enough; one must also practice genuinely. Not everyone can write good popular works. If you are not convinced, give it a try!

Previously, when popular songs emerged, there was a lot of criticism of "decadent music, leading to the downfall of the party and the country." Previously, there was also criticism of disco, and now what has happened? Literary historians always say that "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Journey to the West," and "Dream of the Red Chamber," these works that have made us proud in the world and will continue to make our descendants proud, are all popular reading materials. I have some doubts. According to some "serious" writers, the writers of popular reading materials cannot enter the annals of literary history. I wonder who is more reasonable?

After saying all this, it is only half of the problem. Let's talk about the publishers. After publishers changed from "enterprises" to "businesses," they are economically self-sufficient. Publishers have to become publishing merchants. Contemporary literary creations published by publishers are nine out of ten losing money. Publishers cannot afford to lose money, so they have to use books to "feed" books. Books that can "feed" books are few (good popular reading materials by Chinese writers are hard to find, and foreign ones are considered problematic), so fewer books are published;

"Serious" writers complain about the difficulty of publishing, but are reluctant to write "popular" works, so they write fewer books;

Popular readers cannot understand "serious" literature, cannot see "popular" literature, so they do not read books;

After the "literary attitude" balance is disrupted, who will face the consequences?

### 话说“文态”平衡

　　话说“文态”平衡
    雷抒雁
    收到一本赠书，一看书名，是本通俗小说。再看作者名字十分陌生，谁呢？待翻开扉页细看签名，始知是当代文坛一位知名的作家朋友。
    作家不愿、不屑或不敢写通俗小说，写了就化个假名署在书上，不知为何？近年来，作家们思想大大解放，各种流派都插起旗帜，拉起山头。细翻各种杂志书籍，便知文坛还是很热闹的。唯一遗憾的是出书难，难在销量小。出版家为此忍受了不少指责；杂志社则因销量小，亏损大，叫苦不迭。局外人反映冷漠，说如今读诗的只是诗人和准诗人；读小说的也多是小说界的朋友和文评家。
    文学，实实在在地在文学界为自己筑起了一座城堡和长城。试想，偌大中国，印一本几千册的书与杂志，能到谁手中？
    但这只是问题的一个方面。另一方面则是广大的图书市场和嗷嗷待哺的通俗读物的读者。这一部分读者是商品经济的宠儿。他们为生意而奔波在火车上、轮船上，旅途中漫长的寂寞需要富有刺激的、有趣味的读物去填充。大量的个体经营者，以及从乡村流动到城镇来工作的农工也需要寻找一些有趣的读物打发他们无聊的工余。这一批读者是一批可怕的读者，他们时间多，舍得起花钱，消费胃口又极佳，可惜的是文化层次较低。（我还没有计算那些文化层次较高，同样需要消遣读物的读者。）近年来通俗文学中一浪一浪的“这个热那个热”，多是他们掀起来的；武打、社会新闻，以及一些含有色情描写的“市井文学”，在他们中极有销路。
    供求发生了矛盾。
    “严肃”作家抱着“严肃”文学严肃地埋怨和观望着“严肃”文学严肃地萧条。
    饥渴的读者则饥渴得有些饥不择食。
    于是，“非法出版物”先钻了空子，乘虚而入；接着，港台和外国的畅销书昂然步入市场。社会一片指责声，骂出版社，骂畅销书，骂小书摊。骂得有理！但细一想，这些文化层次低下，无意于读严肃书籍或读不懂严肃书籍，却又腰缠万贯，时间和精力十分充裕的读者，将用什么打发他们多余的时间？打架斗殴？胡作非为？那不更有害于社会吗？
    生态平衡被破坏之后，报复是人人皆知的。现在套用一下这句话，叫做“文态”失去平衡。
    不给喜欢读通俗作品或只能读通俗作品的读者以读物，显然是不行的。没有馒头，又不爱吃高档点心的食客，只好去找“窝窝头”了。吃多了营养不良，“高档点心”却又出现过剩。
    我始终认为“严肃”作家不妨放下架子，写一点健康的、有趣味性的、读者喜闻乐见的通俗作品，自然而然地挤走和替代港台与外国的庸俗读物或所谓格调不高的读物。光放下架子还不行，还得练一练真的。并非人人都写得了好通俗作品，如不服气，写个试试！
    先前出现通俗歌曲时，很是骂过一阵子“靡靡之音，亡党亡国”的，先前也骂过迪斯科，如今又如何了呢？文学史家们总说《三国演义》、《西游记》、《红楼梦》，这些曾经让我们在世界无限骄傲，我们的子孙还要继续骄傲下去的作品，都是通俗读物，我颇有点怀疑。按某些“严肃”作家说的，通俗读物的作家是上不了文学史的。不知谁更有道理？
    说了这些，也只说了问题的一半。再说说出版社。出版社改“事业”为“企业”之后，经济自负盈亏。出版家又不得不当起出版商来。出版社出版的当代文学创作，十有八九赔钱。出版社亏损不起，只好以书“养”书，能“养”书的书少（中国作家写的好通俗读物难找，外国的又被认为有问题），就少出点被养的；
    “严肃”作家骂出书难，又不屑“通”俗，只好少写书；
    通俗读者读不懂“严肃”，看不到“通俗”，只好不读书；
    “文态”平衡破坏之后，谁受报复？
