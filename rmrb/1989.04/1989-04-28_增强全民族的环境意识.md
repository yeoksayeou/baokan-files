The lush green mountains, clear blue skies, and fertile lands of this 9.6 million square kilometer territory are the ancestral home of the Chinese people. If someone were to tell you that our homeland is facing increasingly severe environmental pollution, would you not feel a sense of urgency and concern?

China is still a developing country, and our most pressing task is to develop an economy centered on industrialization. Every country in the world has faced environmental pollution issues as they industrialized. The "public nuisance" problems that plagued Western developed countries in the 1950s and 1960s are now unavoidably confronting us.

According to statistics, China currently discharges over 300 billion tons of wastewater, more than 10 million tons of dust, and more than 10 million tons of sulfur dioxide annually. Each year, we generate over 800 million tons of solid waste, with a cumulative total of over 60 billion tons, occupying more than 500 million square meters of land. Additionally, large areas of vegetation have been destroyed, with forest coverage dropping from 13% at the time of liberation to the current 8.9%. Approximately one-third of our grasslands have severely degraded. On one hand, we face environmental pollution; on the other, ecological destruction. This has led to a decline in the environmental quality of both urban and rural areas, an increase in natural disasters, a reduction in renewable resources, and adverse effects on human health. This situation must be reversed decisively; otherwise, if left unchecked, it will directly affect the quality of life of our people and even threaten our nation's survival.

However, we are a socialist country. The Party and the government, starting from the fundamental interests of the people, proposed several years ago that protecting the environment is a fundamental national policy. Over the past few years, the state has successively promulgated laws such as the "Water Pollution Prevention and Control Law," the "Air Pollution Prevention and Control Law," and the "Forest Law," gradually bringing environmental protection under the rule of law. Despite economic difficulties, the state's investment in environmental protection has increased from 3 billion yuan in 1983 to 7 billion yuan in 1988. Due to our correct policies and effective measures, we have played an important role in avoiding the situation where "economic growth doubles, environmental pollution also doubles."

However, due to the significant backlog in China's environmental and ecological construction, the imbalances in economic development leading to the coexistence of environmental problems at various stages of development (especially the rapid development of township enterprises bringing new environmental problems), and the weak environmental awareness of the entire population, overall, environmental and ecological construction has not kept pace with the environmental and ecological destruction caused by economic development.

The urgent task at hand is to make the fundamental national policy of environmental protection deeply ingrained in people's minds and effectively implemented. We must establish a modern environmental consciousness among the entire nation, especially among decision-makers at all levels. We must unite the entire nation to protect our clean homeland. In recent years, some places have seen overheated economies that have severely damaged the ecological environment. Some places focus only on production without considering pollution; others adopt a policy of killing the hen for the eggs and draining the pond to catch the fish. This approach not only directly hinders the sustainable growth of the economy but also destroys our own home and leaves a legacy of harm for future generations. This situation must not be allowed to continue.

The current rectification and adjustment provide a favorable opportunity to strengthen environmental protection. When reviewing construction projects, special attention should be paid to stopping or delaying those projects with severe pollution. When adjusting the industrial structure, attention should be paid to limiting the development of industries and products with high pollution. As long as the leadership pays attention and effective measures are taken, it is entirely possible to simultaneously rectify the economic environment and the ecological environment. We are full of expectations and confidence for this.

　　增强全民族的环境意识

    青山绿水，蓝天沃野，这９６０万平方公里的国土是中华民族世代生息的家园。如果有人告诉你，我们的家园正在遭到日益严重的环境污染的威胁，你能不陡增忧患意识？
    中国还是个发展中国家，以工业化为主的经济发展是我们最急迫的任务。世界各国伴随着工业化的进程都出现过环境污染的问题。五六十年代搅得西方发达国家上下不安的“公害”难题如今也不可避免地摆到了我们面前。
    据统计，目前我国每年要排放３００多亿吨废水、１０００多万吨烟尘、１０００多万吨二氧化硫，每年的固体废弃物达８０００多万吨，历年堆存总量６０多亿吨，占地５亿多平方米。再加上植被大面积破坏，森林覆盖率由解放初的１３％下降到目前的８．９％，约有１／３的草原严重退化。一面是环境污染，一面是生态破坏，使城乡的环境质量下降，自然灾害增加，可再生资源减少，人体健康受到影响。这种状况必须坚决扭转，否则，如果听任其发展下去，将直接影响我们民族的生活质量，甚至威胁我们民族的生存。
    然而，毕竟我们是社会主义国家，党和政府从人民群众的根本利益出发，几年前就提出：保护环境是我国的一项基本国策。几年来，国家陆续颁布了《水污染防治法》、《大气污染防治法》、《森林法》等一系列法规，使环境保护逐步走上法治的轨道。尽管这些年经济困难，国家用于环境保护的投资由１９８３年的３０亿元增加到１９８８年的７０亿元。由于我们采取了正确的方针和有效的措施，对避免出现“经济翻番环境污染也翻番”的局面起了重要作用。
    但是，由于我国环境生态建设欠账太多，经济发展的不平衡性所带来的各发展阶段的环境问题同时并存（尤其是乡镇企业的迅猛发展带来的新的环境问题），也由于全民的环境意识薄弱，从总体上看，环境生态建设还赶不上由于经济发展造成的环境生态破坏。
    当务之急，是要使保护环境的基本国策深入人心，切实实施，要使全民族（尤其是各级决策者）确立现代环境意识。我们要举国上下齐心保护我们自己清洁的家园。这几年，一些地方的经济过热严重地毁坏了生态环境。有的只顾产量不管污染；有的对自然资源奉行一种杀鸡取卵、竭泽而渔的政策。这样做，不但直接妨碍了下一步经济的持续增长，并且是“吃祖宗饭，造子孙孽”，自毁家园，遗害后代。这种状况决不允许再继续下去。
    当前的治理整顿，是加强环境保护的有利时机。清理基建项目，特别要注意停建缓建那些污染严重的项目；调整产业结构，要注意限制那些污染大的产业和产品的发展。只要领导重视、措施得力，治理经济环境也完全可以同时治理生态环境。对此，我们充满期待也充满信心。
