Over 50 members of the Central Advisory Commission (CAC) in Beijing participated in the annual nationwide voluntary tree-planting activity this morning.

At around 9 a.m., Liu Lantao, Xiao Ke, Chen Xiilian, Duan Junyi, and other CAC standing committee members, along with over 40 CAC members, arrived at the tree-planting site at Banbi Shop Forest Park in the southeastern part of Daxing County. These elderly comrades, all over 70 years old, were full of energy and enthusiasm as they wielded shovels to fill soil around the saplings and carried buckets to water the newly planted trees. In a short time, they planted nearly 100 pine and locust trees.

Banbi Shop Forest Park is the largest man-made forest park in the plains of the suburbs of Beijing, with a greening area of over 18 million mu (approximately 1.2 million hectares). More than 20 species of trees form a continuous forest, presenting different landscapes throughout the year.

After the tree-planting activity, the elderly comrades, at the invitation of the hosts, strolled through the forest and took photos, full of enthusiasm.

　　五十多中顾委同志在京参加义务植树
    新华社北京４月６日电  ５０多位在京的中顾委常委、委员今天上午参加一年一度的全民义务植树活动。
    上午９时许，刘澜涛、肖克、陈锡联、段君毅等中顾委常委和４０多名中顾委委员，来到位于大兴县东南的半壁店森林公园植树现场。这些年逾古稀的老同志，个个精神焕发，兴致勃勃地挥动铁锨为树苗培土，拎起水桶为新栽的树苗浇水，时间不长，就栽种了近百株松柏、槐树。
    半壁店森林公园是京郊平原县最大的人造森林公园，绿化面积为１８００多万亩，２０余种树木连成一片，一年四季呈现出不同景观。
    植树结束后，老同志们应主人之邀兴致盎然地在林间漫步、留影。
