Shanghai's Huangpu District has been making strides in its anti-corruption efforts, focusing on establishing a comprehensive system to combat the "hot-and-cold syndrome" where policies and practices fluctuate unpredictably. This approach aims to ensure consistent and fair governance.

In the past, residents like Mr. Fan from Jinling East Road faced difficulties when trying to transfer his grandson's household registration to Shanghai. Despite attempts to bribe the police with a gold ring, he was refused. The police station had clearly posted a notice stating, "Gifts will not be accepted for any services." Over a month, the Guangdong Road police station rejected gifts worth over 1,000 yuan, demonstrating their strict adherence to the rules. Now, residents of Huangpu District have a positive view of government departments, summarizing their experiences with four phrases: "Applying for services doesn't require money, changing housing doesn't require connections, opening a business doesn't require invitations, and solving problems doesn't require detours."

Public transparency has exposed the flaws of the old system. For instance, displaying policies, procedures, and deadlines on the walls helps residents understand the process, but the sheer volume of regulations can be overwhelming. Simplifying these procedures has made services more accessible. What once took half a month to complete now takes only two days. The Beijing East Road Housing Management Office condensed the revised procedures into a 16-page booklet, clearly outlining the timeframes for different services and the consequences for staff who violate the rules.

While the changes have been well-received, a survey of 1,000 residents revealed lingering concerns:

"Things are good now, but will they last?"
"We've seen good times followed by bad times before!"
"The hot-and-cold syndrome is hard to cure!"

These concerns are not unfounded. The Huangpu District Anti-Corruption Leadership Group has anticipated these issues and proposed a solution: establishing a comprehensive system to regulate officials' behavior and improve their qualifications.

The district has 87 grassroots offices and stations, and relying solely on higher-level supervision is insufficient. They have organized a team of 1,315 volunteer supervisors, including representatives from various levels of the People's Congress, retired cadres, and prominent figures from different sectors. The Traffic Police Squad issues "Supervision Certificates" to these volunteers, allowing them to inspect the discipline of police officers. "Supervision Mailboxes" are managed and opened by the public. Leaders at all levels regularly visit supervisors to gather feedback and share the results of investigations.

Additionally, each grassroots official has signed a responsibility book, with evaluations conducted at each level. A special assessment committee has been established. Each official has a record book documenting their work, including the nature of the task, time taken, and results. Evaluations are categorized as excellent, qualified, basically qualified, and unqualified, with corresponding rewards and punishments.

Currently, Huangpu District is introducing a competitive mechanism for officials, implementing a system of gradual appointments. Those not appointed will either be reassigned, undergo training, retire early, return home for employment, or seek their own paths.

　　防治冷热病要靠制度配套
　　——上海黄浦区廉政建设初探
    本报记者　章世鸿
    金陵东路范某年老独身，他要把外地孙子的户口迁入上海。范某到派出所找民警，送上一个纸包，打开一看，是闪光的金戒指，民警拒收。范某不信，改明送为暗送，结果不但不灵，而且耽误了正事。他没有看到墙上贴着条子：“凡送礼者一概不予办理。”广东路派出所一个月内拒收的礼物价值１０００多元，确实过硬。现在，黄浦区居民对政府部门有四句评语：“申请办事不用送票子，翻改房子不用通路子，开业典礼不用递帖子，遇到难题不用转弯子。”
    公开化把旧体制的弊端暴露了。比如，要把办事政策、程序、日期写在墙上，让居民心中有数，但条文实在太多，太烦琐，如要写，得帖满一墙，谁有耐心看？比如，生一个孩子报户口，也要“过五关、斩六将”，谁受得了？于是大家动手改，把条文简化了，手续也简化了，过去要半个月办成一件事，现在两天就办完。北京东路房管所把修订后的办事制度“浓缩”成一本１６页的小册子，哪些事一天办成，哪些事两天办成，如工作人员违反规定如何处分，都写得一清二楚。
    办事公开半年来，这里的变化确实很大。但１０００份民意调查表明，群众在满意之余，仍有种种担心：
    “好是好，目前是在风头上，是否长得了？”
    “好一阵，坏一阵，我们都领教过了！”
    “热得快，冷得也快，冷热病难治！”
    这些意见也并非没有根据。黄浦区廉政领导小组倒有些预见性，他们医治冷热病的药方是：制度配套，规范干部的行为，提高干部的素质。
    这个区有８７个基层所、站，光靠上级监督是不够的。他们现已组织了一支１３１５人的义务监督员队伍，其中包括各级人大代表、离退休干部及各界知名人士。公安交通队给监督员发“监督证”，持此证有权对民警风纪进行检查。“监督信箱”由群众管理，由群众开启。各级领导定期走访监督员，听取意见，并把查处结果通知监督员。
    另外，该区各基层干部都签订了责任书，一级考一级，还专门成立考核委员会。每个干部都有一个考核记事本，记载办事情况、时间、结果。他们把考核分为优秀、称职、基本称职、不称职，分别给予奖惩。
    现在，黄浦区为引进竞争机制，对干部实行逐级聘任。未聘者要转业，或离职培训，或提早退休，或返家待业，或自谋出路。
