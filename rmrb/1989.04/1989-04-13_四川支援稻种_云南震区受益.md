Sichuan has promptly organized the transportation of 120,000 kilograms of hybrid rice seeds to support the spring farming in the earthquake-stricken areas of Yunnan. Recently, the main leaders of the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government wrote a letter on behalf of the people in the disaster areas to express their gratitude.

On February 14 this year, the front page of this newspaper published an urgent appeal for hybrid rice seeds needed by the earthquake-stricken areas of Yunnan. The leaders of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government paid great attention to this and instructed relevant departments and regions to actively provide support. After more than half a month of work, a total of 128,000 kilograms of hybrid rice seeds were organized and transported.
