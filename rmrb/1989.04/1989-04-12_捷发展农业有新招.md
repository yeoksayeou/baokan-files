Czechoslovakia, located in the heart of Europe, has fertile land and abundant rainfall, providing excellent conditions for agricultural development. However, for a period, the country prioritized industry over agriculture, leading to an annual import of over 200 million tons of grain. In 1973, the Czechoslovak Communist Party set a goal of achieving grain self-sufficiency. After more than a decade of effort, grain production increased from 720 million tons in 1970 to 1,179 million tons in 1988. Currently, the per capita grain supply in Czechoslovakia is approximately 800 kilograms, achieving basic grain self-sufficiency. Meanwhile, livestock production has also seen rapid development. In 1988, the per capita consumption of meat was 86 kilograms, and dairy products were 250 kilograms.

Czechoslovakia's agricultural production has achieved such success primarily due to the continuous increase in investment in agriculture. During the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" (1981-1985), the state invested a total of 103.3 billion koruna (approximately 10 billion dollars) in agriculture, averaging over 20 billion koruna per year. In 1986, the state's investment in agriculture reached nearly 25 billion koruna, accounting for about 14% of the total investment that year. Currently, agricultural and livestock production across the country have basically achieved mechanization. Due to the implementation of a one-stop service for crop harvesting, threshing, storage, and processing, grain losses have been significantly reduced.

In developing agricultural production, Czechoslovakia emphasizes the role of science and technology, promoting and adopting superior varieties. Both the Czech and Slovak Republics have established specialized seed companies responsible for the planting, procurement, and supply of seeds, implementing a monopoly. Due to the use of high-quality seeds, the current grain yield per hectare nationwide is 4.7 tons.

The Czechoslovak Party and government particularly value the development of agricultural education. Currently, a complete agricultural education system with different levels and rational allocation has been formed. In addition to three higher agricultural colleges that specifically train senior agricultural personnel, secondary and tertiary agricultural colleges also utilize the off-season to hold various technical training classes or seminars, improving the professional and cultural knowledge of community members. Now, almost all members of agricultural cooperatives in Czechoslovakia have received specialized technical training. Nationwide, for every 1,000 community members, 27 have received higher education, and nearly 200 have received secondary professional and technical education. The main leaders and chief agronomists of the cooperatives have all received college education.

Implementing comprehensive insurance for agricultural production is an important measure for Czechoslovakia's agricultural development. Starting in 1986, the country implemented comprehensive agricultural insurance, where the state insurance company provides full coverage for grain, economic crops, fruits, vegetables, and livestock production for agricultural units. In 1986 and 1987, the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic Insurance Company alone provided insurance payments of 5.9 billion koruna to affected agricultural units in the Czech region, playing a significant role in restoring agricultural production and stabilizing the lives of rural community members.

The development of Czechoslovakia's agricultural production is also the result of the state's continuous adjustment of agricultural policies and the mobilization of the enthusiasm of agricultural cooperative community members. In 1982, Czechoslovakia relaxed agricultural policies and implemented a new agricultural management system, canceling the numerous mandatory indicators issued by the state, and only issuing grain and meat production indicators to agricultural units. It allowed agricultural units to adjust crop structures and planting plans based on local conditions, encouraging and supporting individuals to engage in agricultural and sideline production in their spare time. Starting from January 1 of this year, the county and state-level agricultural management bureaus were also abolished, and the Federal Ministry of Agriculture directly led agricultural production cooperatives and other agricultural production units. Agricultural production units were also allowed to develop secondary and sideline production after completing grain and meat procurement tasks. Agricultural production units can also establish foreign exchange funds to develop cooperative relationships with foreign agricultural enterprises or production units.

With the development of agricultural production, the living standards of rural community members in Czechoslovakia have also continuously improved. Community members work five days a week, with an average monthly wage of over 3,100 koruna, enjoying free medical care, one month of annual leave, and the ability to travel and recuperate domestically and abroad. Today, in this country with a population of only 15.5 million, the gap between urban and rural areas is disappearing.

　　捷发展农业有新招

    位于欧洲心脏地区的捷克斯洛伐克，土地肥沃、雨量充沛，具有发展农业的良好条件。然而，一段时间由于偏重工业，忽视农业生产，国家每年要进口200多万吨粮食。1973年，捷共提出了粮食自给的目标。经过十几个春秋的努力，粮食产量从1970年的720万吨增加到1988年的1179万吨。目前，捷人均占有粮食约800公斤，基本上实现了粮食自给。与此同时，畜牧业生产也得到迅速发展。1988年人均消费肉类86公斤、牛奶和奶制品250公斤。
    捷克斯洛伐克的农业生产能取得如此成就，首先在于不断增加对农业的投资。“七·五”期间（1981—1985年），国家用于农业的总投资1033亿克朗（约合100多亿美元），平均每年达200多亿克朗。1986年，国家用于农业的投资近250亿克朗，约占当年投资总额的14％。目前，全国农业和畜牧业生产基本上实现了机械化。由于实现了农作物收割、脱粒、储存、加工一条龙作业，大大减少了粮食的损失。
    在发展农业生产中，捷重视科学技术的作用，大力培育和采用优良品种。捷克和斯洛伐克两个共和国都成立了专门的种子公司，负责种子的种植、收购和供应，实行专营。由于采用良种，目前全国每公顷粮食产量达4.7吨。
    捷克斯洛伐克党和政府特别重视发展农业教育。目前已形成了层次不同、配置合理的完整的农业教育体系。除3所高等农业院校专门培养高级农业人材外，高中级农业院校还利用农闲季节举办各种技术讲习班或培训班，提高社员的专业和文化知识。现在，捷克斯洛伐克的所有农业合作社社员几乎都受过专门的技术培训。全国每1000个社员中有27人受过高等教育，近200人受过中等专业技术教育。合作社的主要领导人、总农艺师都受过大专教育。
    对农业生产实行综合保险是捷发展农业的一项重要措施。从1 986年起，捷全国实行农业收成综合保险，即由国家保险公司对农业单位的粮食、经济作物、水果、蔬菜生产、畜牧业生产等实行全面保险。1986、1987两年，仅捷克社会主义共和国保险公司就为捷克地区受灾农业单位提供保险金59亿克朗，对恢复农业生产，稳定农村社员生活起了很大作用。
    捷克斯洛伐克农业生产的发展也是国家不断调整农业政策、调动农业生产合作社社员积极性的结果。1 982年，捷放宽农业政策，实行新的农业管理体制，取消了国家下达的繁多的指令性指标，只向农业单位下达粮食和肉类生产两项指标，允许农业单位根据本地的实际情况调整农作物结构和种植计划，鼓励和支持个人利用业余时间从事农副业生产。从今年1月1日起还取消了县、州两级农业管理局，由联邦农业部对农业生产合作社和其他农业生产单位实行直接领导，允许农业生产单位在完成粮食和肉类征购任务后，发展工、副业生产。农业生产单位还可建立外汇基金，同外国农业企业或生产单位发展合作关系。
    随着农业生产的发展，捷克斯洛伐克农村社员的生活水平也不断提高。社员实行每周五日工作制，月平均工资达3100多克朗，享受公费医疗，每年休假一个月，可以到国内外旅游和疗养。如今在这个人口只有1550万的国家里，城乡差别正在消失。（附图片）
