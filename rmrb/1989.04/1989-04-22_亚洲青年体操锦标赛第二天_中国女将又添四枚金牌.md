The second day of the Asian Youth Gymnastics Championships saw China's female gymnasts dominate, securing four more gold medals in their respective events. The only event in which China did not participate was the rhythmic gymnastics team event, where Japan won the first gold medal of the championships. The Chinese Taipei team also made a mark, securing second place and stepping onto the podium for the first time.

In the women's team and individual all-around gymnastics competitions, the scores were closely contested among several teams. However, as opponents made mistakes, China's Zhang Xia, Li Yan, Wu Lei, and Li Yifang performed even better. Zhang Xia scored the highest mark of the day, 9.875, on the uneven bars. The Chinese youngsters ultimately pulled away from their competitors, winning the team title by a significant margin. The teams from North Korea and Japan took second and third places, respectively. Zhang Xia also won the individual all-around title with a score of 39.025.

The rhythmic gymnastics competition, which was included in the Asian Youth Gymnastics Championships for the first time, concluded today. The teams from China, North Korea, and Japan finished in the top three. China's Bai Mei and Liu Yu took the gold and silver medals in the individual all-around, while North Korea's Han Liangyue secured the bronze.
