Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, April 12th.

A Thai military official confirmed today in Bangkok that Thailand and Laos have agreed to form joint patrol teams to patrol along the Mekong River, aiming to reduce conflicts in the area.

The official stated that Laos has requested the end of the current practice of each country patrolling separately, as this often leads to unnecessary conflicts between the two sides.

This request was made during a meeting held on April 11th in Vientiane between a Thai delegation of 80 people, led by the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Army, General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, and a Lao delegation headed by the Chief of the General Staff of the Lao People's Army, General Sisavath Keobounphanh.

　　为减少湄公河两岸冲突
　　泰老将组成联合巡逻队
    新华社曼谷4月12日电　泰国一位军方人士今天在这里证实，泰国和老挝已同意组成联合巡逻队沿湄公河两岸巡逻，以减少这里的冲突。
    这位人士说，老挝方面要求结束目前两国各自的单独巡逻，因为这样会引起双方不必要的冲突。
    老挝的这一要求是泰国的一个由80人组成的代表团和老挝的一个小组11日在万象会谈时提出来的。泰国代表团由陆军总司令差瓦立·永猜裕率领，老挝小组的负责人是人民军总参谋长西沙瓦·乔本潘。
