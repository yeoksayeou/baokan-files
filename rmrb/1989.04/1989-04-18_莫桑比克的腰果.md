While traveling in Mozambique, one often encounters vast stretches of large trees. These trees have thick trunks, lush foliage, and wide canopies. These are cashew trees.

Cashews are native to the tropical regions of the Americas and are a type of woody oilseed crop. The nuts are fragrant, crisp, and delicious, with high nutritional value, making them a popular international food item. The cashew shells have a high oil content and can be refined into high-grade industrial oil, which is a scarce commodity in high demand worldwide.

Mozambique is one of the world's largest cashew producers, with production once accounting for about 45% of the global total. Cashew exports are a significant source of foreign exchange for Mozambique.

In recent years, due to the increasing global demand for cashews, countries like India and Brazil have significantly expanded their cashew cultivation areas, rapidly surpassing Mozambique in production. Currently, Mozambique is also making efforts to catch up, striving to increase cashew production and exports.

　　莫桑比克的腰果
    在莫桑比克旅行，常看到一种连绵成片的大树。树干粗壮，枝叶繁茂，覆盖面宽大。这就是腰果树。
    腰果原产美洲热带地区，是木本油料作物。果仁香脆味美，营养价值很高，是国际上的畅销食品。腰果壳含油量高，可提炼高级工业用油，是世界上供不应求的紧俏商品。
    莫桑比克是世界上最大腰果生产国之一，产量曾占世界总产量４５％左右。腰果出口是莫桑比克重要外汇来源。
    近年来，由于国际市场对腰果的需求日增，印度、巴西等国大力扩大腰果种植面积，产量迅速超过莫桑比克。而目前，莫桑比克也在急起直追，努力扩大腰果生产和出口。
