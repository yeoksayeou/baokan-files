China will implement a film rating system starting May 1, with four categories of films designated as "not suitable for minors."

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Beijing on April 12, the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television has clarified the regulations for films "not suitable for minors," which will come into effect on May 1 this year.

The Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television has identified the following four types of films as unsuitable for children under 16 (including 16-year-olds): films containing scenes of rape, theft, drug use, drug trafficking, prostitution, and other similar content; films with violent, murderous, or fighting scenes that may induce fear in minors; films that depict sexual behavior as the main plot; and films that portray social deformities. Imported and domestic films approved by the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television and its subordinate film bureaus as "not suitable for minors" will have the phrase "not suitable for minors" printed at the beginning of the film.

The Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television has also stipulated that for films "not suitable for minors," all levels of film distribution and screening companies and all screening units must not organize screenings for minors. They should use various forms such as movie posters, film, and television advertisements to display the phrase "not suitable for minors" to the audience. The head of the Film Bureau emphasized that the implementation of the film rating system does not mean a change in the film censorship standards.
