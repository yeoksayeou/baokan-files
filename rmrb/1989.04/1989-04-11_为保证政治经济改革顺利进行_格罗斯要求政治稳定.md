Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, April 10th.

To ensure the smooth progress of political and economic reforms, Gross calls for political stability. According to today's report by the local "People's Freedom Newspaper," Gross, the General Secretary of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, recently responded to a question from a Soviet television reporter, saying that only by maintaining political stability and ensuring that all new initiatives are constructive can Hungary's political and economic reforms proceed smoothly.

Gross also pointed out that during the process of taking major reform steps, some phenomena that people do not hope for and that are inconsistent with the party's wishes and actions are inevitable. He believes that these phenomena will disappear over time, certain doubts will be dispelled, and political harmony will be restored. He emphasized that in Hungary, very few people believe that negative phenomena are in their interests.

This General Secretary stressed the need to accelerate economic development. He believes that it is unacceptable for the national economy to remain in a state of zero growth for a long time. Hungary's economy needs to grow by an average of 3-4% per year to ensure the repayment of foreign debts, to create the funds needed for reform, and to improve the living standards of the people. He believes that Hungary's current difficulties are temporary and transitional. He is confident that in 2-3 years, Hungary will begin to develop gradually and in a coordinated manner.

　　为保证政治经济改革顺利进行
　　格罗斯要求政治稳定
    新华社布达佩斯４月１０日电　据此间《人民自由报》今天报道，匈牙利社会主义工人党总书记格罗斯最近在答苏联电视台记者问说，只有保持政治体制稳定，只有所有新的倡议都是建设性的，匈牙利的政治改革和经济改革才能顺利地进行。
    格罗斯还指出，在迈出重大改革步伐的过程中，出现一些人们所不希望的以及与党的愿望和做法不一致的现象是不可避免的。他认为，这些现象过一段时间将会消失，某些怀疑将会消除，政治和谐将会恢复，因为在匈牙利只有很少人认为，不良现象是符合他们的利益的。
    这位总书记强调要加快经济发展。他认为，国民经济长期处于零增长状态是不行的。匈牙利经济平均每年增加３—４％，才能保证外债的偿还，才能创造改革所需要的资金，才能提高人民的生活水平。他认为，匈牙利当前的困难是暂时的，过渡性的。他深信，在２、３年内匈将开始逐步地、协调地发展。
