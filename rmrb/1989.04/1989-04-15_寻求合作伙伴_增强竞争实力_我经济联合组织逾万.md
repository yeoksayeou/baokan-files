Industrial enterprises in China, which have been developing horizontally for many years, are now moving towards forming alliances with leading products, core enterprises, and joint investments. According to incomplete statistics, the number of economic alliances in China in 1988 increased by more than half compared to the previous year. Currently, there are more than 10,000 economic alliances registered with the industrial and commercial administration departments.

According to the National Bureau of Statistics, these industrial enterprise alliances are mainly distributed in coastal regions such as Tianjin, Shanghai, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, and Guangdong. The main forms of these economic alliances include leading with famous and high-quality products, core enterprises, specialized division of labor, joint investments, product dissemination, technical services, and industrial and commercial alliances. These organizations generally achieve good operating results. Last year, the total industrial output value of economic alliances increased by 38.3% compared to the previous year, and the realized profit increased by 42.5%.

Economic experts here believe that the rapid development of economic alliances is mainly due to the increased dependence of enterprises on the market. About 70% of the energy and raw materials needed by enterprises depend on the market. Therefore, many enterprises seek cooperation partners and invest in the construction of raw material bases to enhance their competitive strength. However, the current level of horizontal alliances is still relatively low, with only about 40% being tightly integrated alliances. There is an urgent need to accelerate the development and establishment of enterprise groups. Experts suggest that management regulations for economic alliances should be formulated as soon as possible to coordinate the relationships between economic alliances and other aspects, and to regulate and standardize enterprise behavior.

### 寻求合作伙伴　增强竞争实力　我经济联合组织逾万

　　寻求合作伙伴　增强竞争实力
　　我经济联合组织逾万
    新华社北京４月１４日电　（通讯员魏晓霞）崛起多年的我国工业企业横向联合目前正朝着以名优产品为龙头、骨干企业为核心和联合各方投资等联合形式方向发展。据不完全统计，１９８８年全国经济联合组织比上年增加一半以上，目前经工商行政管理部门注册的经济联合组织已超过１万个。
    据国家统计局介绍，这些工业企业联合体主要分布在天津、上海、辽宁、江苏、浙江、福建、山东、广东等沿海地区。经济联合组织的主要形式除以名优产品为龙头或以骨干企业为核心外，还有专业化分工、联合各方投资组建、产品扩散、技术服务以及工商工贸联合等。这种组织普遍获得较好的经营效果。去年经济联合组织工业总产值比上年增长３８．３％，实现利润增长４２．５％。
    此间经济专家分析认为，经济联合组织发展迅速的主要原因是，企业对市场的依赖程度加大，所需能源、燃材料七成左右依赖市场，因此许多企业只好寻求合作伙伴，投资建设原料基地，以增强竞争实力。但目前横向联合组织的联合层次仍较低，紧密型的联合组织只占４０％左右，亟需加快发展和建立企业集团。专家们建议尽快制定经济联合组织的管理法规，以利于协调经济联合组织与其它各方面关系，并约束和规范企业行为。
