Beijing, Great Hall of the People, the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress is being held here. On this day, dressed in olive green coats, the three lawyers from Liaoning Province who had been wrongfully imprisoned for four years and had just been exonerated, with solemn smiles on their faces, presented a banner embroidered with "Long Live the People" here, expressing their deep respect for the legal supervision exercised by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

An Unnecessary Mistake

In 1984, the calendar had turned to its last few pages.

Wang Bairen, the director of the Legal Consultation Office in Tai'an County, Anshan City, was working at his desk. A police car suddenly stopped in front of the Legal Consultation Office. The case handler from the Anshan City Procuratorate, Ni Xizhi, along with armed police and judicial police, rushed into the Legal Consultation Office and threw an arrest warrant accusing Wang Bairen of "concealment" on his desk. They then bound Wang Bairen with ropes and led him through the bustling streets of the county. When Wang Bairen passed by the county guesthouse, a sudden explosion of firecrackers echoed from the county procuratorate across the street. Wang Bairen bitterly smiled, "There are still people sending me off!"

Two months earlier, Wang Bairen's subordinates, lawyers Wang Licheng and Wang Zhishuang, had also been arrested by the procuratorate on charges of "concealment."

Lawyers defending the accused were accused of "concealment"! This was incomprehensible to anyone with a basic understanding of the law. However, such an absurd incident had indeed occurred.

On November 20, 1983, a female worker named Zhao Yanfeng from the Rolling Mill Division of the Tai'an County Machinery Factory died by poisoning. Three days later, the victim's uncle, then 30-year-old factory director Xu Jun, was detained and subsequently arrested on charges of "rape resulting in death."

On May 21, 1984, the Anshan Intermediate People's Court held a trial for Xu Jun's case.

The Tai'an County Legal Consultation Office accepted the commission and assigned lawyers Wang Licheng and Wang Zhishuang to defend the accused. After reviewing the case files, the lawyers concluded that there was substantial evidence of adultery in Xu Jun's "rape" case. After a collective discussion, the two lawyers defended Xu Jun's innocence. Unfortunately, the Anshan Intermediate People's Court still sentenced Xu Jun to death for rape and stripped him of his political rights for life.

After the first trial, the defendant shouted his innocence. Lawyers Wang Licheng and Wang Zhishuang accepted the defendant's request to write an appeal, which was sent to the Higher People's Court of Liaoning Province, requesting a careful decision. However, the appellate court rejected the appeal and upheld the original verdict. Xu Jun was executed on July 28.

More than ten days after Xu Jun's execution, Wang Changchang, who had been imprisoned with Xu Jun on another case, submitted a written report to the county procuratorate accusing lawyer Wang Licheng of "concealment."

The detainee Wang Changchang was arrested in late January 1984 for allegedly raping a female worker. Lawyer Wang Licheng was the civil representative of the young woman, who had recently married and whose husband was working out of town. Wang Changchang held a deep grudge against Wang Licheng for providing legal assistance to the woman in her complaint against him.

This detainee's report aroused great interest from the Anshan City Procuratorate. On October 13, the Anshan City Procuratorate initiated an investigation and determined that Wang Changchang's report was "basically true." Thus, the three lawyers were arrested and imprisoned one after another, and it was decided to pursue criminal responsibility for Wang Licheng, Wang Bairen, and others for "concealment."

Defending the Law or Desecrating the Law?

The news of the three lawyers' arrests spread quickly, shocking the legal community nationwide and attracting the attention of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

Almost simultaneously with the lawyers' prosecution, the National People's Congress Standing Committee's Letters and Visits Office sent investigators to look into the case. On May 8, 1985, the Liaoning Provincial Political and Legal Committee decided to release Wang Licheng and Wang Bairen on bail pending trial. Immediately afterward, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and the Ministry of Justice dispatched a joint investigation team. With the cooperation of the Liaoning Provincial People's Congress and the Provincial Political and Legal Committee, they conducted a comprehensive review for 20 days and confirmed that this was a wrongful case that needed to be corrected.

On July 4, 1985, the Anshan City Procuratorate dropped the charges against the two lawyers and released them; lawyer Wang Zhishuang had a good attitude towards admitting guilt, and it was decided to drop the charges against him.

Four months after the three lawyers were released, the superior procuratorate submitted a review report to the Central Political and Legal Committee at that time, asserting: "This concealment case is generally valid."

Two years later, in February 1987, a team of four from the Supreme People's Procuratorate went to Anshan and reviewed the case of the three lawyers from Tai'an County again.

On May 12, 1987, based on the review opinions of the superior procuratorate, the Anshan City Procuratorate once again determined that the lawyers' actions constituted the crime of concealment and arrested Wang Licheng and the others for the second time.

People could not help but ask, after the Anshan City Procuratorate dropped the case two years ago, without obtaining any new evidence or discovering new criminal facts, why did they repeatedly accuse the lawyers of "concealment"? Was this upholding the dignity of the law or desecrating the sacred law?

The Wrongful Case Moved Hearts

After the three lawyers were arrested and imprisoned, from the national leaders to the common people, everyone closely followed the developments. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress had been seriously concerned about this case since its occurrence and had dispatched investigation teams multiple times to do a lot of meticulous work for effective legal supervision.

Peng Zhen, Wan Li, Hab Com, Chen Pishan, Peng Chong, Huang Hua, Liao Hansheng, Wang Hanbin, and other leading comrades of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress had repeatedly inquired about this case.

Zhang Youyu, the vice chairman of the Legal Committee of the Sixth National People's Congress and a famous jurist, carefully reviewed and analyzed the case files and wrote two written opinions, believing that "the Xu Jun case is indeed a suspicious case" and "the case of the three lawyers is indeed a wrongful case."

Wang Gong, a famous lawyer and a member of the National People's Congress, appealed to the newly appointed procurator-general Liu Fuzhi during the deliberation of the Supreme People's Procuratorate's work report at the first session of the Seventh National People's Congress to quickly correct this wrongful case.

On September 12, 1986, more than ten criminal law and criminal procedure law experts in Beijing conducted a comprehensive argumentation on the case of the three lawyers, unanimously believing that the arrest of the three lawyers was a serious illegal wrongful case.

In November 1987, the Ministry of Justice selected three lawyers proficient in law from Beijing, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang to form a legal team and conducted on-site investigations in Anshan, confirming that the lawyers had defended Xu Jun's case reasonably.

In 1988, shortly after Liu Fuzhi took office as the procurator-general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, he ordered the Liaoning Provincial Procuratorate to clarify the situation and quickly correct this wrongful case.

Under the supervision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, on December 17, 1988, Zhang Xifu, the deputy procurator-general of the Anshan City Procuratorate, went to Tai'an County to read the "Decision to Withdraw the Prosecution" to Wang Licheng and apologized to the three lawyers and other parties at the exoneration meeting.

This year, before the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress, the Supreme People's Procuratorate reported to the Internal and Judicial Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress on the situation regarding the correction of the case of Wang Licheng and others in Tai'an County by the Anshan City Procuratorate.

Thus, this wrongful case, which lasted for four years and went through many twists and turns, was finally exonerated. At this moment, people smiled, a smile of relief, a heavy smile, and a smile of hope and victory.

It's Not Just Reflection on This Case

Although this tragedy ended in such a difficult and tortuous way, the value of the tragedy may lie in its ability to make people reflect in heart-wrenching pain.

Reflection One: About Power. Those who believe they have special privileges fear most that someone will challenge these privileges.

Power, like a wild horse, once unbridled, will run amok and trample everything. What about the constitution, the law, the highest power organ? In their eyes, it seems worthless. Listen to a small procuratorate official's reprimand to the families of the three lawyers: "Don't keep appealing. Didn't your letter to Peng Zhen end up with me? What good is that? I still have the final say!"

This obvious wrongful case, under the supervision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, still took several years and went through many twists and turns before it could be corrected. This does not show how intense the struggle between supervision and anti-supervision is! For this, wise people at the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress called for the rapid formulation of the People's Congress Supervision Law and the establishment of a special power supervision committee to effectively supervise power.

Reflection Two: About Rights. Extreme admiration for power is inevitably accompanied by brutal trampling of rights.

In litigation activities, the defendant's right to seek defense is a right granted by law. Protecting the legitimate rights and interests of the parties is the sacred duty of lawyers. However, those who only care about personal power and ignore citizens' rights often observe lawyers' work with colored glasses. During the three lawyers' wrongful imprisonment, a leader of the Anshan City Committee said in public several times: "There are a few lawyers who always cause trouble and help criminals get away with it. They should be dealt with!"

Reflection Three: About Authority. In the eyes of some judicial personnel, judicial organs represent the state and are sacred. Even if mistakes are made, they cannot easily admit them, otherwise, it will damage their authority. If this organ is an advanced unit established by the superior, it is even more unacceptable for the masses to comment. Even if mistakes are made, they must not be corrected publicly.

Look: A responsible person from the once-advanced unit, the Anshan City Procuratorate, told Xu Jun's father: "Your son's case has been reviewed, it's ironclad. We made no mistakes in the cases we handled in 1984."

The reason why the correction of the three lawyers' case took so long and went through many twists and turns is related to the fact that some people in the Anshan City Procuratorate only cared about maintaining the face of the advanced unit and one-sidedly maintained their own "authority."

However, authority is not self-proclaimed, nor is it granted by a superior organ, nor can it be maintained by insisting on errors. It comes from one's own integrity, from loyalty to the law and the people, and from the people's heartfelt trust and support.

　　一次很有价值的较量    
    ——全国人大常委会监督检察机关纠正三律师错案纪实
    新华社记者周长新本报记者  吴恒权
    北京，人民大会堂，七届全国人大二次会议正在这里举行大会。这一天，身着橄榄绿风衣，蒙冤４年刚刚获平反的辽宁三律师，面带凝重的笑意，将一面绣着“人民万岁”的锦旗送到这里，对全国人大常委会行使的法律监督表示深深的敬意。
    不该发生的错案
    １９８４年，日历已翻到最后几页。
    鞍山市台安县法律顾问处主任王百义正伏案工作。一辆警车在法律顾问处门前戛然而止。鞍山市检察院的办案人倪喜志带着武警和法警直奔法律顾问处，将一张指控有“包庇罪”的逮捕证扔在王百义的写字台上。接着将王百义五花大绑绑起来，押着他穿过县城的闹市区。当王百义途经县招待所时，对面的县检察院内忽然响起“二踢脚”的爆炸声。王百义苦笑道：“还有人为我壮行！”
    早在两个月前，王百义手下的律师王力成、王志双也被检察机关指控为“包庇罪”被捕。
    律师为被告人辩护，竟被指控为“包庇罪”！这对稍有法律常识的人来说，是难以理解的。然而，这种违背常识的事却偏偏发生了。
    １９８３年１１月２０日，台安县机械厂轧钢分厂女工赵艳凤服毒身亡。３天后，死者的姨父，时年３０岁的轧钢分厂厂长徐军被拘留，旋即以“强奸致死人命罪”被捕。
    １９８４年５月２１日，鞍山市中级人民法院，开庭审理徐军一案。
    台安县法律顾问处接受委托，指派律师王力成、王志双为被告人辩护。律师阅卷后认为，在徐军“强奸”案中，存在大量无法排除的通奸证据。经法律顾问处集体研究，两律师为被告徐军作了无罪辩护。遗憾的是，鞍山市中级人民法院仍以强奸罪判处徐军死刑，剥夺政治权利终身。
    一审判决后，被告大喊冤枉。律师王力成、王志双接受被告的请求，为其代写上诉状，寄到辽宁省高级人民法院，请求慎重决断。可是，二审法院驳回上诉，维持原判，徐军于７月２８日被处决。
    徐军被执行死刑１０多天，因另案与徐军同监关押的王长长向县检察院递交了检举律师王力成犯“包庇罪”的书面材料。
    在押犯王长长，于１９８４年１月底，因一女工控告他犯有强奸罪而被捕，律师王力成是那个刚刚结婚不久，丈夫在外地的弱女子的民事代理人，为那个女工控告王长长提供了法律帮助。为此，王长长对王力成恨之入骨。
    这个在押犯的“检举”，却引起鞍山市人民检察院的极大兴趣。１０月１３日，鞍山市检察院立案侦查，并认定王长长检举的情况“基本存在”。于是，三律师先后被捕入狱，并决定以包庇罪追究王力成、王百义等人的刑事责任。
    是维护法律还是亵渎法律？
    三律师被捕的消息不胫而走，全国律师界为之震惊，也引起全国人大常委会的关注。
    几乎在律师被起诉的同时，全国人大常委信访局派人调查了此案。１９８５年５月８日，辽宁省政法委员会决定对王力成、王百义取保候审。紧接着，全国人大常委会，最高人民法院，最高人民检察院和司法部派出联合调查组，在辽宁省人大，省委政法委联合调查组的配合下，进行了为期２０天的全面复查，确认这是一起错案，应予纠正。
    １９８５年７月４日，鞍山市检察院对两律师撤诉，宣告释放；律师王志双认罪态度较好，决定免予起诉。
    在三名律师获释后４个月，上级检察机关向当时的中央政法委员会提交了一份复查报告断言：“此包庇案从总体看是成立的”。
    事隔两年，１９８７年２月，最高人民检察院一行４人到鞍山，对台安县三律师案又一次进行复查。
    １９８７年５月１２日，鞍山市检察院以上级检察机关的复查意见为据，再次认定律师的行为构成包庇罪，第二次将律师王力成等人逮捕。
    人们又不禁要问，鞍山市检察院在撤销案件两年之后，在没有获取任何新的证据，没有发现有新的犯罪事实的情况下，反反复复地指控律师犯有“包庇罪”，这是维护法律尊严还是亵渎神圣的法律？
    错案牵动众人心
    三律师被捕入狱后，上至国家领导人，下到平民百姓，都密切关注着事态的发展，全国人大常委会从案发之初，就对此案表示严重关切，并多次派出调查组，为实施有效的法律监督做了许多细致的工作。
    彭真、万里、习仲勋、陈丕显、彭冲、黄华、廖汉生、王汉斌等全国人大常委会的领导同志多次过问此案。
    六届全国人大法律委员会副主任委员，著名法学家张友渔仔细阅看并分析案卷，两次写出书面意见，认为“徐军案确实是疑案”“三律师案确实是错案”。
    全国人大代表，著名律师王工在七届人大一次会议上审议最高人民检察院工作报告时，吁请新任检察长刘复之尽快纠正这起错案。
    １９８６年９月１２日，１０多名在北京的刑法、刑诉法专家对三律师案进行了全面论证，一致认为逮捕三律师，是一起严重的违法错案。
    １９８７年１１月，司法部从北京、辽宁、黑龙江选调了三位精通法律的律师组成律师团，赴鞍山进行实地调查后，确认律师对徐军案辩得有理。
    １９８８年，刘复之就任最高检察长不久，责成辽宁省检察院查清情况，迅速纠正这一错案。
    在全国人大常委会和最高人民检察院的监督下，１９８８年１２月１７日，鞍山市检察院副检察长张喜文来到台安县向王力成宣读鞍山市检察院“撤销免予起诉决定书”，并在平反大会上向三位律师和其他当事人表示道歉。
    今年，七届全国人大二次会议前夕，最高人民检察院向全国人大内务司法委员会转报了鞍山市检察院《关于纠正台安县王力成等人包庇一案的情况报告》。
    至此，这起历时４年，几经反复的错案终获平反。此时，人们笑了，这是欣慰的笑，是沉重的笑，也是希望和胜利的笑。
    不仅是对本案的思索
    这一幕悲剧尽管结束得那样艰难、曲折。悲剧的价值，也许就在于它能使人们在刻骨铭心的痛楚中思索。
    思索之一：关于权力。自恃特权在握的人，最怕有人向这种特权挑战。
    权力这匹野马，一旦失去羁绊，就会横冲直撞，践踏一切。什么宪法、法律，什么最高权力机关，在他们看来似乎一钱不值。请听一位小小检察员对三律师的家属训话：“别老往上告了，你们写给彭真的信不还是转给我了吗？那算啥？还得我说了算！”
    这起明显的错案，在全国人大常委会的监督下，还历时数年，几经反复才得以纠正，不正说明监督与反监督的较量是多么激烈！对此，有识之士在七届全国人民代表大会二次会议上呼吁，要尽快制定人民代表大会监督法，成立专门的权力监督委员会，对权力实行有效的监督。
    思索之二：关于权利。对权力的极端推崇，必然伴随着对权利的粗暴践踏。
    在诉讼活动中，被告人寻求辩护是法律赋予的权利。维护当事人的合法权益，是律师的神圣职责。然而，只顾及个人权力而无视公民权利的人，往往总是带有色眼镜观察律师工作。三律师蒙冤期间，鞍山市委有位领导就几次在公开场合说：“有那么几个律师成天瞎搅和，替罪犯开脱，该好好整整了！”
    思索之三：关于权威。在一些司法人员看来，司法机关代表国家，神圣无比，即使出了差错，也不能轻易认帐，否则，有损他们的权威。如果这个机关是上级树立的先进单位，更是不容群众评头品足。即便出了错，也决不能公开纠正。
    请看：曾是先进单位的鞍山市检察院一位负责人对徐军的父亲说：“你儿子的案子复查了，铁板一块，我们１９８４年办的案子一件也没错。”
    三律师案的纠正为何旷日持久、反反复复，这与鞍山市检察院一些人只顾保全先进单位面子，片面地维护自身的“权威”不无关系。
    然而，权威不是自封，也不是上级机关赐给的，更不是靠坚持错误不改能维持的，它来自自身的廉洁，来自对法律和人民的忠诚，来自人民群众出自内心的信任和拥护。
