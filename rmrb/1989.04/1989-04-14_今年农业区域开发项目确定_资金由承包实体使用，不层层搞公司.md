This year's agricultural regional development projects have been determined. The funds will be used by the contracting entities and will not be allocated through multiple layers of companies.

The People's Daily, Beijing, April 13th - Recently, Minister of Agriculture He Kang revealed that the state's arrangements for this year's regional comprehensive development projects have been confirmed. The State Council and relevant departments and provinces have established teams to organize and implement these projects.

This year, the state has arranged two batches of regional development projects. The first batch includes eight major areas: Hunan, central Sichuan, the core of the Jianghan Plain and the northern hills of Hubei, Poyang Lake and southwestern Jiangxi, eastern Inner Mongolia, the Yinchuan Plain, the Shandong Yellow River Delta, and Hainan. The second batch includes projects such as the development of the northern Shaanxi drylands and the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai. Through these developments, the goal is to open up 4 million mu of land, with the majority used for grain, cotton, oil, and sugar production; to rehabilitate 6 million mu of saline-alkali and waterlogged land; to increase the area of land protected from flooding by 4 million mu; to increase the area of irrigated farmland by 4 million mu; to develop 10 million mu of winter fallow land in the south; and to focus on improving dryland farming in the north.

To ensure that this year's development work is solid and effective, the State Council emphasizes that agricultural development is a government responsibility. It must ensure the unity of economic, social, and ecological benefits. The use of development funds is strictly for the economic entities within the development zone that are contracted to carry out the development, and it is not allowed to be distributed through multiple layers of companies.

The comprehensive development of agricultural regions is an initiative that the State Council began organizing last year. Last year, the Sanjiang Plain, the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, and the cotton and sugar bases in Xinjiang and Guangxi were included in the national key development plan.

　　今年农业区域开发项目确定
　　资金由承包实体使用，不层层搞公司
    本报北京４月１３日讯　农业部部长何康最近透露：国家安排的今年区域综合开发项目已经确定，国务院及有关部门和有关省区已成立班子，负责组织实施。
    今年国家安排的区域开发项目分为两批，第一批安排八大片，包括湖南、川中、江汉平原腹地和鄂北岗地、鄱阳湖和赣西南、内蒙古东部、银南河套、山东黄河三角洲，以及海南地区。第二批包括渭北旱原开发、青海柴达木盆地开发等项目。通过以上开发，争取开荒４００万亩，其中大部分用于粮棉油糖生产；改造盐碱渍害地６００万亩；增加除涝面积４００万亩；增加农田灌溉面积４００万亩；开发南方冬闲田１０００万亩；重点抓好北方旱作农业。
    为使今年的开发工作扎扎实实进行，国务院强调农业开发是政府行为，要保证经济效益、社会效益、生态效益三者统一。开发资金的使用只能给开发区内承包开发的经济实体，不能层层搞公司。
    农业区域的综合开发，是国务院去年开始组织的。去年，三江平原、黄淮海平原和新疆、广西棉糖基地建设被列入国家重点开发计划。
