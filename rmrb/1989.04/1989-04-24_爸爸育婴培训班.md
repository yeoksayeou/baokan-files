Fatherhood Training Class

In the city of Cluj, Romania, renowned pediatrician Dorin Ropea has organized a "Fatherhood Training Class" for first-time fathers. The class aims to guide them in quickly learning how to care for their children when their wives are busy.

The training class is personally taught by Dr. Ropea, with experienced pediatricians invited to give regular lectures. The courses include topics such as "How to feed and what to feed infants?" "How to bathe infants?" "How to help infants exercise?" and many other essential child-rearing knowledge points.

The training class regularly holds "final exams" in a local auditorium, during which distinguished commentators are invited to "proctor" the exams, and some audience members are invited to observe, to emphasize the importance and practical value of holding this training class.

Recently, the first batch of 33 young fathers who participated in the training class successfully passed the "final exam."
