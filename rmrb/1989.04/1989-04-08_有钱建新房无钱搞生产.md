Ten years ago, the annual per capita income of farmers in Dongshan County, Fujian, was less than fifty-four yuan. In 1988, this figure rose to 1,204 yuan. However, in 1988, the total savings of urban and rural residents in the county decreased by nearly four percentage points compared to 1987. Where did all the money go?

It turns out that many farmers in Dongshan County have spent a significant portion of their money on building new houses, some of which are quite luxurious. Now, the per capita living space for farmers in Dongshan County has increased from 7.5 square meters in 1981 to 24 square meters in 1988. In these seven years, farmers have invested an average of 5,000 yuan per person in building houses. Some farmers, after building new houses, find themselves unable to develop their production further. How to guide farmers' consumption is indeed a problem that relevant departments should pay attention to.

　　有钱建新房无钱搞生产
    十年前人均年收入不到五十四元的福建东山县农民，一九八八年的人均收入增到一千二百零四元。可是，一九八八年全县城乡居民的储蓄额比一九八七年下降了近四个百分点。钱都到哪儿去了？
    原来，东山县不少农民把相当部分的钱用于建新房，有的住宅建得十分豪华。现在，东山县农民的人均住房面积已从一九八一年的七点五平方米增加到一九八八年的二十四平方米。在这七年里，农民人均投入的建房资金约五千元。一些农民建了新房，便无力发展生产了。如何引导农民消费，倒是值得有关部门重视的问题。
