Chinese readers may be familiar with the term "new journalism" (New Journalism). In recent years, many reportage works have worn this "hat," and there have been numerous articles discussing this genre, but most of them focus on the literary aspects. In fact, the origins of this genre are closely tied to the efforts of American journalists.

On an autumn day in 1962, Tom Wolfe, a reporter for the *New York Herald Tribune*, read a piece by Talese in *Esquire* magazine. The article was a character sketch of a sports star's private life, with a style that was neither fish nor fowl, and dialogues and plots as vivid and concrete as in a novel. Wolfe was completely taken aback by the possibility of writing news in this way. Years later, he said, "Interestingly, when New Journalism gained prominence in the following 10 years, many writers and journalists reacted the same way I did initially: 'These guys are making it up!' ... The truly fashionable way of reporting became something no one knew how to grasp, because no one was accustomed to measuring news reports with aesthetic standards."

Wolfe began to experiment with this style of writing. These works, which he called "New Journalism," were full of literary colors, with some passages even resembling the works of Western stream-of-consciousness master Joyce. Wolfe's masterpieces, once published, disturbed the previously peaceful realms of news and literature. Supporters said, "It perfectly combines the imagination and insight of writers with the sensitivity of journalists"; critics said, "It blurs the boundaries between literature and news, reality and fiction." Regardless, Wolfe became famous overnight with just a few articles, which could not help but make those hardworking but obscure journalists envious. Thus, imitators emerged, and many excellent long-form works were born. The most famous include Capote's *In Cold Blood*, Norman Mailer's *The Armies of the Night*, and Talese's *The Wife of His Youth*. These works are also known as "non-fiction novels" (Non-fiction).

In his book *Fact and Fiction*, American critic Harold Hayes provides a comprehensive summary of the six characteristics of New Journalism. These six characteristics are: 1. Dramatic scenes; 2. Complete dialogue records; 3. Detailed descriptions of the social status of characters; 4. In-depth psychological and background analysis; 5. Interior monologues; 6. Composite characters. The last two characteristics often draw criticism, but Talese insists, "Although the masterpieces of New Journalism often read like novels, they are not novels. They are, or should be, as reliable as the most trustworthy news reports."

The New Journalism genre emerged in the tumultuous 1960s. Faced with an unpredictable reality, Americans, with their individualistic traditions, first sought to determine the meaning of individual existence. The general characteristic of the cultural trends at the time was a focus on the relationship between individuals and society, and the thoughts reflected in the New Journalism genre also embodied this characteristic. Hayes clearly points out, "The most striking difference between New Journalism and traditional news reporting is that the relationship between the author and the people and events they report on has changed." Traditional news reporting has a sacred principle: report only facts, not opinions. By the 1960s, relying solely on this reporting principle was no longer enough to meet the needs of readers. Faced with a complex society, readers not only wanted to know what happened but also why it happened. Mailer said, "The crux of all news genres is that reporters pretend to be objective while actually lying." Wolfe called the newspapers of the 1950s "totems." He emphasized that this seemingly objective news only reflected the words and deeds of officials and the strange and unusual, and was disconnected from the changing social reality, completely unable to reflect the voices of ordinary people.

New Journalism emphasizes the expression of the author's personal subjective feelings, stressing the infiltration of personal emotions and views, precisely to not only tell a good story but also "help readers evaluate this experience" (Mailer's words). It can be seen that the author's position here has undergone an important change—from an outsider to a participant. This pursuit is called by scholars "moving towards a higher level of objectivity."

The works of New Journalism have some fundamental similarities with what we call reportage, such as both having news value and literary value. In terms of style, it reflects the literary tendencies in news writing and the journalistic tendencies in literary writing. These two tendencies have had an important impact on contemporary American news and literature. It has elevated the significance of news and the professional value of journalists. The current president of the American Writers Association, Salisbury, is first a journalist and then a writer—an author of non-fiction works. In 1985, an American with a similar dual identity came to Beijing to participate in the Sino-American Writers Conference and said something meaningful: "The word 'news' itself makes us think that it deals with daily life, but what news seeks is to have the power to shock the heart like a great work of imagination and to achieve an enduring status."

　　追求震撼人心的力量    
    ——美国的新新闻主义
    丁刚
    中国读者对新新闻主义（ＮｅｗＪｏｕｒｎlｉｓｍ）这个名词可能并不陌生。近几年有许多报告文学作品都戴着这个“帽子”，探讨这种流派的文章也不少，但大多是从文学的角度着眼。其实，这个流派的发轫与美国记者的努力是分不开的。
    １９６２年的一个秋日，美国《纽约先驱论坛报》记者汤姆·沃尔夫在《老爷》杂志里读到了一篇塔利斯写的人物特写，描写一个体育明星的私生活，文体不伦不类，对话和情节像小说一样生动具体。沃尔夫万万没有料到新闻可以这么写。数年后，他说：“有趣的是，当新新闻主义在以后的１０年里兴起时，许多作家和记者的反应都和我当初一样：‘这些混蛋在胡编乱造！’……真正时髦的报道方式成了谁也不知道怎么去把握的东西，因为从未有人习惯于用美学的尺度去衡量新闻报道。”
    沃尔夫开始尝试着用这种笔法写作。这些被他称为“新新闻主义”的作品充满了文学色彩，有些段落甚至就像是出自西方意识流大师乔依斯之手。沃尔夫的大作一经问世就扰动了本来相安无事的新闻和文学两个领域。褒者曰：“将作家的想象力、洞察力与记者的感觉完美地结合在一起”；贬者说：“它混淆了文学与新闻、真实与虚构的界限。”不管怎么说，沃尔夫靠几篇文章就名扬四方，却不能不叫那些辛辛苦苦而默默无闻的记者妒羡。于是，效仿者不断，亦有不少长篇佳作问世。最出名的有卡波特的《冷血》、诺曼·梅勒的《夜之军》、塔利斯的《你邻居的妻子》等，这些作品亦被称为“非虚构小说”（Ｎｏｎ-ｆｉｃｔｉｏｎ）。
    美国著名评论家哈罗维尔在《事实与虚构》一书中比较全面地总结了新新闻主义的６个特点。这６个特点是：１、戏剧化场景；２、完整的对话记录；３、人物社会身分的细致描写；４、深入透彻的心理和背景分析；５、内心独白；６、角色的拼合。最后两个特点常常招致非议，但塔利斯却坚持认为：“新新闻主义的佳作尽管常常读起来像小说，但却不是小说。它就像，或者说应该像最可靠的新闻报道一样可靠。”
    新新闻主义流派是在充满危机的６０年代兴起的。面对捉摸不定的现实，具有个人主义传统的美国人首先要确定的是个人存在的意义。当时文化思潮的普遍特征就是注重个人与社会的关系，新新闻主义流派所反映的思想也体现了这一特征。哈罗维尔明确指出：“新新闻主义与传统的新闻报道的最显著的差别在于，作者与他所报道的人和事之间的关系发生了变化。”传统的新闻报道有一个被奉若神明的信条：只报道事实，不报道意见。到了６０年代，仅仅依靠这种报道信条已很难满足读者的需要。面对纷繁复杂的社会，读者不仅需要知道发生了什么，更需要知道为什么会发生。梅勒说，“所有新闻体裁的作品的症结就在于，报道者装得客观，而实际上是在说谎。”沃尔夫则把５０年代的报纸称为“图腾”。他强调，这种貌似客观的新闻只注意反映达官贵人的言行和稀奇古怪的见闻，与激变的社会现实脱节，根本不能反映普通老百姓的呼声。
    新新闻主义注重表现作者个人的主观感受，强调个人感情与观点的渗透，就是为了不仅要讲好故事，“而且也帮助读者评价这一经历”（梅勒语）。可以看出，作者的位置在这里发生了重要变化——从局外人变成了参与者。这种追求被学者们称为“向更高层次的客观迈进”。
    新新闻主义的作品与我们所说的报告文学作品有一些基本的相通之处，例如都是既有新闻性又有文学性，就文体而言，它反映的是新闻写作中的文学化倾向和文学写作中的新闻化倾向。这两种倾向对美国当代新闻和文学产生了重要的影响。它提高了新闻的意义和记者的职业价值。现任全美作家协会主席的索尔兹伯里就首先是一位记者，然后才是一位作家——非虚构作品的作家。１９８５年，一位与索尔兹伯里同样具有双重身分的美国人来北京参加中美作家会议，他说了这样一段意味深长的话：“新闻这个词本身就使我们想到那是和日常生活打交道的，然而新闻所追求的也是要像想象力丰富的伟大作品那样具有震撼人心的力量而达到经久不衰的境地。”
