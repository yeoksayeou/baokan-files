Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, April 7th.

The shortage of labor has become a serious problem hindering Hong Kong's economic development. Therefore, the Hong Kong business community hopes that the Hong Kong government will relax restrictions and allow the import of foreign workers, including those from mainland China, to alleviate the labor shortage in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government has expressed its consideration to relax restrictions on the entry of foreign technical workers.

Recently, nine major business associations in Hong Kong jointly organized a group to investigate the labor shortage problem in Hong Kong. Yesterday, this group released a research report. The report stated that the current labor shortage in Hong Kong is approximately 200,000, reaching a level that various industries find difficult to accept. The labor shortage is most severe in the construction, garment, hotel, and retail sectors. The labor shortage has affected Hong Kong's economic growth, increased inflationary pressures, and led to a decline in the quality of Hong Kong's products and services.

The labor shortage problem in Hong Kong has persisted for some time, and the business community's demand to import foreign workers, including those from mainland China, is not new.

Only recently, the Hong Kong government has expressed its consideration to adopt a more flexible policy and relax restrictions on the import of technical workers, but it reiterated that it has no intention to change its past policy of not allowing the import of a large number of non-technical workers. As for the specific measures to relax the restrictions on the import of technical workers, the Hong Kong government stated that it will announce them in the coming weeks.

　　港工商界要求引进外地劳工
    新华社香港４月７日电  （记者陈晓彬）劳工短缺现已成为困扰香港经济发展的一个严重问题，因此香港工商界希望香港政府能放宽限制，引进包括内地在内的外地劳工来港工作，以缓解香港的劳工短缺问题。香港政府则表示考虑放宽对外地技术劳工来港的限制。
    前些时候，香港的９个主要工商团体联合组织了一个小组，调查香港的劳工短缺问题。昨天这个小组发表了一份研究报告。报告认为，目前香港欠缺劳工的数目大约为２０万，已达到各行业难以接受的程度，其中建筑、成衣、酒店及零售业劳工短缺问题最为严重。劳工短缺，影响了香港的经济增长，增强了通货膨胀压力，并造成香港的产品和服务质量下降。
    香港的劳工短缺问题已持续了一个时期，工商界要求引进包括内地劳工在内的外地劳工的呼声也并非自今日始。
    直至近日，香港政府才表示考虑采取更有弹性的政策，放宽输入技术劳工的限制，但重申无意改变既往不准输入大量非技术劳工的政策。至于如何放宽输入技术劳工限制的具体办法，香港政府表示将在日后数周内公布。
