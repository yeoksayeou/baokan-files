India's Ministry of External Affairs announced today that it has decided to withdraw a large number of Indian troops from Sri Lanka in the coming weeks.

A spokesperson for the Ministry told reporters that this decision was made in light of the improved situation in the Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka.

Indian troops were deployed to Sri Lanka under the 1987 Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord to quell the ethnic conflicts that had been raging in the northeastern regions for four years. By the end of March this year, there were approximately 50,000 Indian soldiers stationed in Sri Lanka.

　　印度外交部宣市
　　将从斯撤出大批部队
    新华社新德里4月11日电　印度外交部的一位发言人今天在这里正式宣布，印度决定今后几周从斯里兰卡撤出大批印度部队。
    这位发言人告诉记者，印度作出这一决定，是考虑到斯里兰卡北方——东方省的形势已有所改善。
    印度部队是根据印斯1987年签订的和平协议进驻斯里兰卡的，以平息该国东北地区长达4年之久的种族冲突。到今年3月底，有大约5万印军驻在斯里兰卡。
