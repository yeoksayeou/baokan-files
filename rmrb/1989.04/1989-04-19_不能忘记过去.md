April 20th marks the 100th anniversary of the birth of Adolf Hitler, the chief war criminal of Nazi Germany. Many neo-Nazi and neo-Fascist elements in various European countries have planned to engage in disruptive activities on this day. Police and security personnel in the Federal Republic of Germany are closely monitoring the activities of 25,000 extreme right-wing individuals in the country, particularly the 1,500 hardcore neo-Nazis, to prevent them from engaging in illegal propaganda and violent actions.

Legally, the Federal Republic of Germany has inherited the Third Reich of Hitler and bears the heavy historical responsibility of compensating for the losses caused by Hitler's war and persecution. Since 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany has paid 80 billion marks (approximately $43 billion) in compensation over 40 years, and it is estimated that by the end of the century, another 20 billion marks in compensation and pensions will be paid. By 1987, the courts of the Federal Republic of Germany had tried and imprisoned 6,500 Nazi war criminals, of whom 160 were sentenced to life imprisonment.

Leaders of the Federal Republic of Germany have repeatedly emphasized the importance of not forgetting the past. The first president of the Federal Republic of Germany after World War II, Theodor Heuss, once said that the Nazi invasions were not collective crimes but collective shame. In 1977, then-President Walter Scheel criticized the teaching of history in German schools, saying, "We are facing the danger of becoming a country without history." Current President Richard von Weizsäcker stressed, "If a country does not know how to view the past, it is easy to make mistakes in the present." In 1985, Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl said at the Bergen-Belsen Nazi concentration camp memorial for the victims, "A country that betrays history is doomed."

However, educating the younger generation to remember the tragic and horrifying past is not an easy task. Although many books about Hitler's Nazi rule have been published, and in the 1970s, numerous films and television programs took this as their theme, the atrocities of Nazi Germany, such as the massacre of 30 to 50 million people and the physical annihilation of 6 million Jews, remain unfamiliar to the younger generation of Germans. When the documentary "Holocaust" was shown, many German youth were shocked and found it hard to believe. In 1976, the Federal Republic of Germany conducted a nationwide survey of students to see if they knew about Hitler. The results showed that many students did not know who Hitler was. Some thought he was a fictional character, and a few even believed that the "Führer" was a philanthropist.

However, Nazism has not disappeared. In the early 1950s, during the Cold War, some of Hitler's supporters infiltrated the newly formed political parties in the Federal Republic of Germany. After lying low for nearly 20 years, the extreme right-wing elements resurfaced in the 1960s under the guise of the "National Democratic Party," entering seven local parliaments in 11 local elections, and nearly entering the national parliament in 1969. Extreme right-wing forces are expanding their influence, leveraging political, economic, and social factors within the Federal Republic of Germany.

The laws of the Federal Republic of Germany stipulate that more than 5% of the votes are required to enter any local parliament. In 1987, in Bremen, and in early 1988, in Frankfurt, the votes obtained by radical right-wing elements had already exceeded 5%. Recently, in the local elections in Frankfurt, they reached 6.6%. It is estimated that these extreme right-wing elements may engage in a major struggle with democratic progressive forces in the 1990 national elections.

According to information held by intelligence personnel of the Federal Republic of Germany, the number of organized extreme right-wing elements has increased from 17,000 to the current 25,000 over the past 10 years. The increase in their publications is even faster. From 1986 to 1987 alone, the number increased by 14%, now reaching 90 million copies.

Although extreme right-wing elements have not yet become an influential force in politics or society, the lingering specter of Hitler is a matter of concern.

　　不能忘记过去
　　梁丽娟
    ４月２０日是纳粹德国头号战争罪犯希特勒诞生１００周年。许多欧洲国家的新纳粹分子和新法西斯分子已纷纷计划在４月２０日这天进行滋事生非的纪念活动。联邦德国的警察和保安人员正密切注视着本国的２．５万名极右分子，特别是其中１５００名铁杆新纳粹分子的活动，防止他们进行非法的宣传和暴力行动。
    从法律上说，联邦德国继承了希特勒的第三帝国，也承担了沉重的历史责任，要赔偿因希特勒发动战争及进行迫害造成的损失和审讯战争罪犯。从１９４９年以来４０年内联邦德国政府已支付８００亿马克（约合４３０亿美元）的赔偿费，预计到本世纪末还要支付２００亿马克的赔偿费和养老金等。截至１９８７年，联邦德国法庭已审讯并监禁了６５００名纳粹战犯，其中１６０人被判处终生监禁。
    联邦德国政府领导人多次强调不能忘记过去。二次大战后的联邦德国第一任总统豪斯就曾说过纳粹的侵略暴行不是集体的罪行，而是集体的耻辱。１９７７年，当时的总统谢尔批评联邦德国学校里教授历史课时不提邪恶的希特勒年代，他说，“我们正面临着成为一个没有历史的国家这种危险。”现任总统魏茨泽克强调说，“如果一个国家不知道如何看待过去，就很容易在当前犯错误。”联邦德国总理科尔１９８５年在伯根—比尔森纳粹死亡营悼念受害者时说，“一个背叛历史的国家只能完蛋。”
    然而，教育后人不忘悲惨可怕的过去并不是容易的事。虽然关于希特勒纳粹统治的书籍出版了不少，７０年代，好些电影、电视也纷纷以此为主题，但是关于纳粹德国曾经屠杀了３０００万到５０００万人、从肉体上消灭了６００万犹太人这些暴行，对年轻一代的德国人仍然是陌生的。纪录片《大屠杀》上映时，许多德国青年感到震惊、难以置信。１９７６年联邦德国曾在全国范围调查学生是否知道希特勒。调查的结果是，好些学生不知道希特勒为何许人。有的以为是个虚构人物，少数人甚至还以为“元首”是一位慈善家。
    但是纳粹主义并未灰飞烟灭。５０年代初的冷战时期，联邦德国的一些希特勒的拥护者混进新成立的政党。此后，极右翼分子在销声匿迹了近２０年后，于６０年代以“国家民主党”的面目东山再起，在１１个地方议会的选举中进入了７个地方议会，１９６９年还差一点进入了国家议会。极右翼的力量正借助联邦德国国内的政治、经济、社会因素在日益扩大。
    联邦德国法律规定要获得超过５％的选票才能进入任何地方议会。１９８７年在不列曼市、１９８８年初在法兰克福市，激进右翼分子得到的选票都已经突破了５％。最近在法兰克福市地方选举中达到６．6％。据估计，这些极端右翼分子可能会在１９９０年的全国大选中同民主进步势力作一番大的较量。
    据联邦德国情报人员掌握的情况，过去１０年内有组织的极右翼分子从１．７万人增加到目前的２．５万人。他们的出版物增加速度更快。仅从１９８６年到１９８７年就增加了１４％，现在已发行９００万份。
    虽然极右翼分子目前还未能在政局或社会上成为有影响的力量，但是，希特勒阴魂未散，却是值得引起重视的。
