Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 20th.

Yesterday evening until this morning, nearly 300 students gathered in front of Zhongnanhai Gate and attempted to storm the compound. Some gave inflammatory speeches, others shouted reactionary slogans, and still others threw bricks and bottles at police maintaining order.

According to comrades from the Beijing Public Security Bureau, four police officers were injured by bricks and bottles thrown from the crowd.

During the day yesterday, some people, under the pretense of mourning Hu Yaobang, caused trouble at Tiananmen Square. They laughed and joked, shouted, and created a chaotic atmosphere. There was no sense of mourning or sadness. Some even climbed onto the Monument to the People's Heroes and defaced the marble sculptures. Others gave inflammatory speeches. The wreaths mourning Hu Yaobang were trampled and disarrayed. Some people in the crowd said, "This isn't mourning Hu Yaobang; this is using the opportunity to cause trouble."

At 9 PM, many people crowded in front of Zhongnanhai Gate to sit in protest. At that time, more onlookers and people of unknown identity were present than students, with the number reaching several thousand at its peak, causing traffic disruptions. Some of the "protesters" repeatedly attempted to storm Zhongnanhai, but were stopped by the guards. Some students gave speeches and shouted slogans. Some even shouted the reactionary slogan, "Down with the Communist Party."

At 1:40 AM today, a few workers finishing their night shift passed by Zhongnanhai Gate. They asked the "protesters," "What good will come from this?" "This isn't mourning; this is causing trouble."

At 3:45 AM, the scene began broadcasting a notice from the Beijing Municipal People's Government. The notice stated that a few people with ulterior motives had stormed Zhongnanhai Gate and injured police officers maintaining order, which was a serious illegal act. It hoped that onlookers would be vigilant, maintain stability and unity, and leave the scene. The notice warned the few people intent on causing trouble that if they continued to act recklessly, they would bear all consequences.

After hearing the notice and the police's persuasion, some people left. Among those who remained, some students asked, "Should we withdraw?" Someone incited, "We can't withdraw! We are the pillars of society; we must persist to the end." Some students stood up to leave, but someone next to them threatened, "Those who leave are traitors!"

After the public security and armed police officers' repeated persuasion and guidance, these people gradually left. By around 5 AM, order in front of Zhongnanhai Gate had been restored.

　　数百人围聚新华门前制造事端     
    北京市发布通告警告蓄意闹事者
    新华社北京４月２０日电  昨晚至今晨有近３００名学生围聚在新华门前并冲击中南海。他们有的发表煽动性演说，有的呼喊反动口号，有的向维持秩序的警察投掷砖块和汽水瓶。
    据北京市公安局的同志介绍，有４名警察被人群中掷来的砖块、瓶子打伤。
    昨天白天就有一些人假借悼念胡耀邦同志在天安门广场制造事端。他们嬉笑打闹，起哄喊叫，无悲痛、哀悼的气氛。有的人还登上纪念碑的栏杆，爬上碑基，在汉白玉的浮雕上乱涂乱画。有的发表煽动性演说。悼念胡耀邦同志的花圈被他们踩得乱七八糟。群众中有人说，这哪里是悼念胡耀邦，这是在借机煽动闹事。
    晚９时，许多人拥到新华门前静坐。当时围观的和身份不明的人比学生更多，最多时达数千人，交通一度中断。“静坐”的人中，有的多次试图冲进中南海，被守卫在那里的警卫战士拦住。一些学生发表演讲，呼喊口号。有人甚至还喊出“打倒共产党”的反动口号。
    今天凌晨１时４０分，几个下夜班的工人路过新华门。他们问“静坐”的人：“你们这样闹究竟有什么好处！”“你们这不是悼念，是在闹事”。
    ３点４５分以后，现场开始广播北京市人民政府通告。《通告》指出，少数别有用心的人冲击新华门，击伤维护秩序的民警，是严重的违法行为。希望围观的人提高警惕，维护安定团结的大局，离开现场。《通告》警告蓄意肇事的少数人，如果继续一意孤行，一切后果由他们自负。
    听了通告和警察的劝说，一些人走了。在剩下的人中，有的学生提出“是不是撤走？”有人挑拨说：“不能撤！我们是社会的栋梁，要坚持到底。”有的学生站起来想走，旁边就有人以胁迫的口吻说“走的是叛徒！”
    经过公安、武警战士多方劝告、疏导，这些人陆续离去。凌晨５时许，新华门前的秩序已恢复正常。
