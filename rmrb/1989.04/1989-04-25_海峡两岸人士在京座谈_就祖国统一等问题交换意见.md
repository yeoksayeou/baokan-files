People from both sides of the Taiwan Strait held a discussion in Beijing today, exchanging views on the reunification of the motherland and other issues.

Representatives from the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference's Committee for the Promotion of National Reunification, the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, and the China Association for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification, among other departments, met with members of the "Chinese Democratic Peaceful Unification Visiting Delegation," led by Taiwan "Legislative Yuan" member Fei Xiping, at the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Hall.

Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Cheng Siyuan, spoke first, saying that through the efforts of the people of Taiwan and the rest of the nation, a harmonious atmosphere has emerged across the Taiwan Strait, and cultural and economic exchanges between the two sides have increased. However, he noted that the Taiwan authorities are still setting up obstacles, resisting negotiations, and pushing for "flexible diplomacy," with some even advocating for the "two governments under one country" slogan, attempting to maintain a long-term divided status.

He stated that we advocate for peaceful reunification and "one country, two systems," and oppose all forms of separatism and any speech or actions that could lead to separation. We sincerely hope that the Taiwan authorities will follow the trend and the will of the people, remove obstacles, and expand exchanges between the two sides. We are willing to meet with people from all walks of life in Taiwan, regardless of their political affiliations or beliefs, to have candid discussions, jointly deliberate on national affairs, and accelerate the process of national reunification.

Fei Xiping shared his views during the discussion. He said that the purpose of their visit to the mainland is to hope that China can be reunified as soon as possible. The delegation includes professors and writers who are very enthusiastic about China's reunification because it is a shared aspiration of all Chinese people. Fei Xiping believes that China's reunification is not an easy task and will require a transitional period. The two sides of the Taiwan Strait need to strengthen exchanges and mutual understanding. He said that only through extensive exchanges can the "Taiwan independence" consciousness be resolved.

Other members of the visiting delegation also expressed that while China's reunification will be a process, they hope that through contact and understanding, this process can be shortened.

In the evening, Cheng Siyuan hosted a banquet for the visiting delegation at the Great Hall of the People.

　　海峡两岸人士在京座谈    
    就祖国统一等问题交换意见
    新华社北京４月２５日电（记者李择红）全国政协祖国统一联谊委员会、国务院台湾事务办公室、中国和平统一促进会等部门有关人士，今天在全国政协礼堂与以台湾“立法委员”费希平为团长的“中国民主和平统一访问团”成员座谈，就祖国统一等问题交换了意见。
    全国政协副主席程思远首先发言说，经过包括台湾人民在内的全国人民的努力，海峡两岸已出现祥和气氛，两岸的文化、经济交流日益增多。但是，我们也看到台湾当局仍在设置障碍，抗拒和谈，并且加紧推行“弹性外交”，甚至有人提出“一国两府”的口号，力图维持长期分裂的局面。
    他说，我们主张和平统一、“一国两制”，反对一切分裂及一切可能造成分裂的言论和行动。我们真诚希望台湾当局顺应潮流，顺乎民心，消除障碍，扩大两岸间交流。我们愿意同台湾各界人士，不分党派信仰，坦诚相见，共商国是，加速祖国统一的进程。
    费希平在座谈会上畅谈了自己的看法。他说，我们这次组团来大陆访问，主要希望中国能早日统一。我们这个团有教授、有作家，对中国统一抱有很大热情，因为统一是全中国人民所共同期望的。费希平认为，中国的统一不是一件很容易的事情，还有一个过渡的时期。海峡两岸要加强交流，加强彼此间的了解。他说，只有广泛交流，才能化解“台独”意识。
    访问团的其他成员也表示，中国统一虽然有一个过程，但希望通过接触了解，把这个过程缩短。
    晚上，程思远在人民大会堂宴请了访问团一行。
