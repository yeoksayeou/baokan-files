Ye Zishan to Fan Quan:

Dear Comrade Fan Quan,

The "Complete Works" has selected three short stories by my father. I have reviewed them. At the end of 1913, my father began writing novels using classical Chinese (which was commonly used in newspapers and magazines at the time). By the end of 1915, he had published about 20 pieces. According to the order of publication, "Poverty and Hardship" should be placed before "Illusory Reflection." After a three-year gap, by the end of 1918, my father started writing novels in vernacular Chinese, with three published before the May Fourth Movement. "A Life" was the second of these.

"A Life" was published in the newly launched "New Tide," originally titled "Is This Also a Person?" In 1922, it was included in the collection "Isolation," where the title was changed to "A Life." Subsequent editions have followed this title. This time, for the "Ye Shengtao Collection," we have changed it back to "Is This Also a Person," removing the question mark. There are two reasons for this: ① The novel does not complete the life of the female protagonist, so the title "A Life" seems inconsistent with the content (of course, it can also be interpreted that after reading the first half of the protagonist's life, one can infer the second half); ② The title "A Life" seems more objective, whereas "Is This Also a Person" better reflects the author's attitude. As for the question mark, since the sentence can be either a question or an exclamation, and my father generally disapproved of using both a question mark and an exclamation mark together, we decided to remove it for clarity. If you agree with our reasoning, please follow the "Ye Shengtao Collection," Volume 1, pages 99-102 for typesetting. There are a few characters and punctuation marks that need correction, which I have noted on another sheet of paper.

My father's classical Chinese novels were written when he was around 20 years old, truly deserving the term "early works." After more than 70 years, I have finally collected and read them carefully a few times. It seems that my father was both imitating and experimenting. From the structure and style, there are imitations of "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio," translations of Lin Qinnan's short stories, Su Manshu's "Broken Swans and Lonely Geese" (which my father had copied and bound into a book when it was serialized), and contemporary essays from newspapers and magazines. The content is also diverse, including realistic works like "Poverty and Hardship," purely fictional works like "Illusory Reflection," reflections of the miserable plight of the working class, expressions of patriotic sentiments, depictions of friendships and maternal love, and works aimed at conveying certain thoughts or beliefs. There are also supernatural tales, romantic stories, and critiques of social issues. It is strange that after two years of imitation and experimentation, my father suddenly stopped. Perhaps he felt bored because he couldn't break free from the mold, a feeling he often had. At that time, he might have also been dissatisfied with continuing to deal with publications like "Saturday" for a living. Another possibility is that his interest shifted to basic education. After a three-year gap, on the eve of the May Fourth Movement, influenced by new ideas, my father resumed writing novels, of course, no longer in classical Chinese but in vernacular Chinese.

Volume 8 of the "Ye Shengtao Collection" is poetry, and we have included my father's "early works" as well. There are about 50 poems and lyrics, all written before he was 20. The proofs have been reviewed, and the book is expected to be published in early next year. If the "Complete Works" selects from the "Poetry Collection," please notify us.

	Sincerely,

	Ye Zishan

    叶圣陶的“少作”范泉同志：
    “大系”的《小说集》选了我父亲的三个短篇，我看够了。１９１３年底，父亲开始学写小说，用的文言（当时的报刊通用文言），到１９１５年底，共发表了２０来篇；按发表先后，《穷愁》应该放在《灵台艳影》前头。隔了三年，到１９１８年底，父亲又用白话写起小说来，有三篇是“五四”前发表的，《一生》是第二篇。
    《一生》发表在才创刊不久的《新潮》上，篇名本来是《这也是一个人？》１９２２年编进作品集《隔膜》，改成了《一生》，以后各种选本都袭用这个篇名。这一回编《叶圣陶集》，我们改了回来，仍旧用《这也是一个人》，而删去了问号。理由有两个：①小说没把女主人公的一生写完，用《一生》作篇名似乎跟内容不符（当然也可以这样理会，看了女主人公的前半生，她的后半生就可想而知了）；②《一生》这个篇名似乎客观了些，不如《这也是一个人》能表明作者所持的态度。至于那个问号，因为这句话可以是提问，也可以是诧叹；父亲一向不赞成问号和叹号并用，考虑的结果，不如删去了干净。如果同意我们的想法，请照《叶圣陶集》第一卷９９—１０２页发排；有几个字几个标点得改正，我写在另一张纸上。
    父亲的文言小说是２０岁前后写的，真称得上“少作”。隔了７０多年，我才把收集到的认真读了几遍，好像看到父亲一边在摹仿，一边在试探。从结构和笔调看，有摹仿《聊斋志异》的，有摹仿林琴南译述的短篇的，有摹仿苏曼殊的《断鸿零雁记》（连载发表时，父亲曾逐段抄录，装订成册），有摹仿报刊上的时文的。内容也很杂，有《穷愁》那样写实的；有《灵台艳影》那样纯属虚构的，有的反映劳苦群众的悲惨遭遇，有的抒发弱国人民的爱国情绪，有的描摹朋友之情母子之情，有的则为了表达某种思想某种信念，还有志异的，言情的，揭露时弊的。奇怪的是这样摹仿试探了整整两年，父亲突然中止了。因跳不出窠臼而感到无聊，这种不满意自己的想法，父亲是经常有的，那时也可能有。也可能不愿意再跟《礼拜六》一类的刊物打交道，讨生活。还有个可能是兴趣转移到了基础教育方面。隔了三年，在“五四”前夕受到了新思潮的冲击，父亲才重新写起小说来，当然不再用文言而改用白话了。
    《叶圣陶集》第八卷是诗歌，我们把父亲的“少作”也编了进去，诗词共五十来首，是２０岁以前写的。校样已经看到，估计年初可以见书。“大系”的《诗歌集》如果选用，也请通知一声。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　祝
    工作顺利，
    新年愉快。
