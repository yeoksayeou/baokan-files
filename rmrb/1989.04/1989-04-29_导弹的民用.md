Japan successfully launched the world's first "steel-making missile" in 1980. Inside the missile's warhead compartment, there are two electric furnaces. The temperature of these furnaces can be remotely controlled between 1000-1500°C. Each furnace can produce a batch of nickel-molybdenum alloy every 7 minutes, and the alloy can be recovered after 4 hours. The alloy produced by the missile has a strength 2.5 times higher, a hardness 1.85-1.90 times greater, and an extremely high purity, free from pores and impurities compared to alloys produced on the ground.

The Soviet Union once experimented with "missile drilling," which involved connecting the rocket segments of a missile launch. The high-temperature flames from the rocket melt the rocks, allowing for deep drilling into the earth's layers. The average drilling speed can reach 7 meters per hour, with a daily progress of 160-170 meters, far surpassing the capabilities of any other drilling equipment.

The United Kingdom has also seen the emergence of "missile mail." The warhead compartment of the missile is used as a mail package. When the missile is launched to the target area, the "missile mail package" descends to the ground using a parachute. Mail that would take 1 day to deliver by air can be delivered in just 1 hour using missile mail, making it the fastest mail delivery method in the world.

The United States has developed "missile television," which involves launching a 20-centimeter-long, 10-centimeter-diameter, 3.5-kilogram micro television transmitter to the target area using a missile. This allows for the monitoring of various situations within the area. This "missile television" can be used for marine rescue, monitoring volcanic activity, landslides, and avalanches.

　　导弹的民用
    日本于１９８０年发射成功了世界上第一枚“炼钢导弹”。在该导弹的弹头舱内装有两只电炉，炉温可在１０００—１５００℃之间遥控调节，每７分钟可炼１炉镍钼合金，４小时后即可回收。导弹冶炼的合金，其强度比在地面上冶炼的要高２．５倍，硬度高１．８５—１．９０倍，且纯度极好，不带气孔和杂质。
    苏联曾试验“导弹钻探”，即把发射导弹的火箭一节节接起来，用火箭喷出的高温火焰熔化岩石，从而向地层深处钻探，其钻探速度平均可达每小时７米，日钻进１６０—１７０米，远远超过了任何其他钻探设备的钻探能力。
    英国则出现过“导弹邮递”。将导弹的弹头舱作为邮包，当导弹发射至目的地上空时，“导弹邮包”借助降落伞降落到地面上。航空邮寄需１天时间的邮件，用导弹邮寄只需要１小时，是目前世界上最快的邮寄方法。
    美国的“导弹电视”，是用导弹将长２０厘米、直径１０厘米、重３．５公斤的微型电视发射台发射到目标区，就能将该区域内的各种情况尽收“眼”底。这种“导弹电视”可用于海上救护、监测火山、泥石流和雪崩等险情。
