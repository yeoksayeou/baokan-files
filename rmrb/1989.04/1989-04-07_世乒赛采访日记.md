April 4, cloudy turning to overcast
I watched the men's team final, and I felt very depressed. Emotionally, I found it hard to accept China's defeat.
After the match, I tried to enter the inner court for an interview with the coach, but I encountered a small problem. The staff's attitude suddenly became harsh. I think this was related to Jiang Jialiang's argument with the West German referee.
This incident caused a sensation in the arena, with various opinions. In fact, this incident did not happen by chance; it had a background. A few days ago, I heard the Chinese team's coaches and players complain that European referees had obvious biases, being lenient with Europeans but very strict with Asians, especially the Chinese team. I felt that the Chinese team's dissatisfaction with the referees obviously carried over into the final, but they neglected the psychological preparation needed to control their emotions and handle difficulties. When they were at a disadvantage during the match and encountered a referee issue, they reacted a bit too sensitively and emotionally.
In my personal opinion, when Jiang Jialiang served, his hand was already above the table as the ball left his hand, so it should not have been ruled a foul. Moreover, the rules state that a verbal warning should be given first before a point is deducted. The referee did not issue any warning. This was also one of the reasons for the escalation of the conflict.

　　世乒赛采访日记
    ４月４日多云转阴
    看了男子团体决赛，心里很压抑，对中国队的失败感情上难以接受。
    赛后我想进入内场采访教练，遇到小麻烦，工作人员态度突然变得生硬。我想是与江嘉良与西德裁判争执有关。
    这件事在赛场引起轰动，众说不一。其实此事的发生并非偶然，有其发生的背景。前几天我就听到中国队教练、队员反映，欧洲裁判有明显的倾向性，对欧洲人判得松，而对亚洲人特别是中国队挑剔得很。我感到中国队对裁判不满的情绪显然带到决赛中，同时却忽视了自我控制情绪应付困难的心理准备。当比赛中处于下风之际，又遇到裁判问题，表现得有点过于敏感和激动。
    我个人认为江嘉良发球时，球抛离手的一刹那，手掌已在台面之上，不应判犯规。再说规则上讲，应先提口头警告再判失分，裁判并没有提出过警告。这也是导致矛盾激化的原因之一。
