People's Daily, Harbin, March 31st - Reporter Wǔ Péi Zhēn reports: 3,200 forest police in Heilongjiang are braving the cold, entering the deep forests of various forest areas a week earlier than usual to protect the forests and prevent fires, starting their arduous tent life.

This spring, the leaders of the Heilongjiang Forest Police Corps analyzed the situation in various forest areas, noting that the snowfall last winter was less than usual, spring came earlier, and the temperature was higher than average. They believed the situation was similar to that before the 1987 Great Khingan Forest Fire. They ordered all units to strengthen fire source management, improve firefighting capabilities, and dispatched 3,200 forest police a week earlier to various posts deep in the forests. The headquarters in Harbin sent double the number of work teams to various forest areas compared to previous years, with two-thirds of the division-level cadres entering the front lines.

Now, various firefighting tools and vehicles have arrived at the duty points, and all wireless communication equipment has been activated. The entire forest police force is currently executing patrol duties and is ready to rush to any fire outbreak points at any time.

　　黑龙江森林警察进林防火
    本报哈尔滨３月３１日电  记者武培真报道：黑龙江省３２００名森林警察冒着严寒，比往年提前一周进入各林区的深山老林，护林防火，开始了艰苦的帐篷生活。
    今春伊始，黑龙江森林警察总队负责人分析了各林区去冬降雪较少、春来较早、气温偏高的情况，认为与１９８７年大兴安岭森林大火发生前的形势类似。他们指令各支队加强火源管理，提高扑救能力，并将３２００名森林警察提前一周派进森林腹地各个岗位。位于哈尔滨的总队机关派往各林区的工作组比往年增加一倍，２／３的师级干部都进入第一线。
    现在，各种扑火工具和车辆都抵达值勤点，无线电通讯设备已全部开通。整个森警部队正在紧张地执行巡护任务，并随时准备扑向林火发生点。
