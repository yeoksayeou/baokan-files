	Building Bridges of Friendship

	By Jiao Qingchao

	Mr. Sun Huishuang is a renowned opera translator and an associate professor at the Beijing Language Institute. This high-achieving graduate of the 1960s, now with silvering temples, lights up with extraordinary enthusiasm when discussing opera: "During my university days, I resolved to combine French and music as my lifelong career."

	Over the past 20 years, he has systematically introduced to Chinese readers the famous operas and translation theories of the French-speaking world. He has translated 12 outstanding works, including "Carmen," "The Merry Widow," and "Helen of Troy," totaling approximately two million words, filling a gap in China's opera industry and translation theory.

	Worthy of special mention is his lecture series on opera translation theory, which has had a significant impact both domestically and internationally. He has been invited to lecture in Paris, Canada, and other places, receiving enthusiastic welcomes and bringing honor to our motherland.

	Sun Huishuang is fully dedicated to his opera translation and research. Take "Carmen" for example; it took nearly ten years of his heart and soul. To avoid disturbing his wife and children, in winter, he moved his chair to the bathroom; in summer, he worked on a table in the kitchen. Through hardship and perseverance, he presented the famous French opera "Carmen" to Chinese readers in beautiful verse. After the Central Opera Theater's performance of "Carmen," it received the International Grand Prize from the most authoritative record selection organization in France, the Charles Colas Society; Sun Huishuang, as the translator, was awarded the "Knight of Arts and Letters" medal in the name of the President of France.

	Sun Huishuang is also a skilled cook. He says, "Translating an opera is like cooking a meal; it requires technique and careful consideration of the flavor."

　　架设友谊的桥梁
    焦青超
    孙慧双先生是歌剧翻译家，北京语言学院副教授。这位６０年代初外语学院毕业的高材生，如今两鬓染霜，谈起歌剧却立即显出非凡的热情：“我在大学时，就立志把法文和音乐结合起来，作为我终身的事业。”
    ２０多年来，他有计划地向中国读者全面介绍西方法语地区的著名歌剧和翻译理论，共翻译了《卡门》、《快乐寡妇》、《美人海伦》等１２部优秀作品，约二百多万字，填补了我国歌剧事业和翻译理论的空白。
    特别值得一提的是，他开设的歌剧翻译理论专题讲座，在国内外产生了一定影响。他曾应邀赴巴黎、加拿大等地讲学，受到热烈欢迎，为我们祖国赢得了荣誉。
    孙慧双全心全意搞他的歌剧翻译和研究。就拿《卡门》来说，几乎耗了近十年的心血。为了不影响妻儿休息，冬天，他把椅子挪到厕所里去；夏天，他改在厨房的一张案板上工作。茹苦含辛，终于使法国的著名歌剧《卡门》以优美的韵文出现在中国读者面前。《卡门》由中央歌剧院演出后，获得了法国最权威的唱片评选机构——夏尔·科罗学会颁发的国际大奖；孙慧双作为译者，获得了以法兰西总统名义颁授的“艺术与文学骑士”勋章。
    孙慧双会烧一手好菜。他说：“翻译一部歌剧如同做饭菜，得讲技巧并仔细琢磨味道。”
