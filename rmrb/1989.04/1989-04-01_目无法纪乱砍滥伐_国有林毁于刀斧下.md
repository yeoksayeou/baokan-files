Since May 1988, some villagers from Zhuquan Township in Zhouzhi County in our province have been recklessly felling trees in the Tangyu Forestry Station in Meixian County. The number of illegal loggers ranges from several dozen to as many as two or three hundred per day. Some use tractors, while others use carts. Currently, 80% of the mature trees in the 33,000 mu of state-owned forest in the Dazhen Working Area of this forestry station have been felled. The 500-plus mu of oil pines, 300-plus mu of locust trees, 200-plus mu of economic forests, and 100-plus mu of bamboo forests in Fengchi Village Forestry Station have been completely stripped bare.

The Meixian County Public Security Bureau has dispatched more than 20 police officers to investigate and handle the relevant lawbreakers, but this rampant looting has not subsided. According to investigations, the "four-side" trees in Angou, Zuikou, and Xizhai Villages in Qinghua Township, Meixian County, are also being or have already been destroyed.

　　目无法纪乱砍滥伐　国有林毁于刀斧下
    １９８８年５月以来，我省周至县竹峪乡一些村民肆意砍伐眉县汤峪林场的林木，盗伐者每天少则几十人，多则二三百人。有的人开着拖拉机，有的拉着架子车。目前，这个林场代镇工区３．３万亩国有林，８０％以上的成材树木被砍伐，枫池村林场的５００多亩油松、３００多亩刺槐、２００多亩经济林、１００多亩竹林被洗劫一空。
    眉县公安局曾出动２０多名干警查处有关不法分子，但是，这场哄抢风仍未平息。据调查，眉县青化乡安沟、嘴头、西寨等村的“四旁”树木，也正在或已经遭到破坏。　　　　　陕西宝鸡日报　王振文　陕西眉县广播站　赵怀生
