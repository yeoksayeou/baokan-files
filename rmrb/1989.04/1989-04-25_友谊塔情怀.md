On a hillside north of Mount Taedong in the center of Pyongyang, stands a magnificent and imposing structure. At the top of the tower, a gold star symbolizing victory and glory, with a diameter of 1.5 meters, shines brilliantly. On the front of the tower, three large gold-colored Korean characters spell out "Friendship Tower."

The towering Friendship Tower records the glorious achievements of the Chinese People's Volunteers in "resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending the motherland." It is a symbol of the friendship forged in blood between the peoples of China and Korea.

At 3:30 PM on April 25, General Secretary Zhao Ziyang and his entourage arrived at the Friendship Tower. With a heart full of remembrance for the volunteer martyrs, he laid a wreath and observed a moment of silence to the sound of mournful music. He then ascended the steps to view the inscription on the front of the base of the tower and a stone relief on the left side depicting the joint struggle of the peoples of China and Korea and their participation in the post-war reconstruction of Korea.

As Zhao Ziyang watched the intricately carved relief, he listened attentively to the guide's explanation. The guide told Zhao Ziyang that the memorial tower was built on October 25, 1959, to commemorate the Chinese People's Volunteers' entry into the Korean War. After the expansion began on November 4, 1983, the tower now stands at 30 meters high, covering an area of 120,000 square meters. The entire tower is constructed from 1,025 blocks of granite and marble, symbolizing October 25, the day the Chinese People's Volunteers entered the Korean War.

Pushing open the one-ton bronze door on the back of the tower, Zhao Ziyang entered a circular stone chamber made of exquisite marble. In the center of the chamber, a black marble chest contains the register of the volunteer martyrs. Zhao Ziyang flipped through the two thick, red-bound volumes of the martyrs' register, seeing one unforgettable name after another. They were Li Xiang, Mao Anying, Huang Jiguang, Luo Shengjiao, Qiu Shaoyun... As Zhao Ziyang solemnly flipped through the register, he said to Comrade Wu Xueqian, "Many people from Shandong and Hebei sacrificed their lives."

After viewing the register of martyrs, Zhao Ziyang and his entourage looked at the three murals on the walls of the chamber. These are vivid and realistic historical scenes: the first part, "The Chapter of Participation," reflects the Chinese people sending their finest sons to the Korean front, raising the banner of "resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending the motherland," and crossing the Yalu River; the second part, "The Chapter of Battle," depicts heroes like Huang Jiguang fighting side by side with the Korean people, defeating the American aggressors and achieving glorious feats; the third part, "The Chapter of Reconstruction," records the Chinese volunteers helping the Korean people restore peace and rebuild their homes after the war, depicting moving scenes.

Zhao Ziyang walked out of the chamber, looked up at the sky, and wrote in the guestbook, "The friendship forged in blood will last forever."

As he bid farewell, Zhao Ziyang's eyes were slightly red, deeply moving everyone present. At the solemn and reverent Friendship Tower, people will never forget the inscription on the base of the tower: "Chinese People's Volunteer Martyrs! You raised the banner of resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending the motherland, and fought side by side with us on this land, defeating our common enemy. Your immortal achievements and the internationalist friendship forged in blood between the peoples of China and Korea will shine forever on this prosperous and flourishing land."

　　友谊塔情怀
    本报记者  徐宝康
    平壤市中心牡丹峰北侧的山岗上，高耸着一座宏伟壮观的建筑。高高的塔顶上一颗象征胜利和光荣的直径为１．５米的金星光彩夺目。塔身正面嵌着三个朝文镏金大字“友谊塔”。
    巍巍友谊塔，记载着中国人民志愿军“抗美援朝、保家为国”的丰功伟绩，是中朝两国人民用鲜血凝成的友谊象征。
    ４月２５日下午３时３０分，赵紫阳总书记一行来到友谊塔前。他以缅怀志愿军烈士的心情，在哀乐声中，献花圈、默哀。接着，走上台阶观看了塔座正面的碑文和左侧一幅反映中朝两国人民并肩战斗和投入朝鲜战后恢复建设的石雕壁画。
    赵紫阳一面看着雕刻精细的壁画，一面仔细听着讲解员的介绍。讲解员告诉赵紫阳，这座纪念塔是１９５９年１０月２５日为纪念中国人民志愿军赴朝参战而建的。１９８３年１１月４日动工扩建后，目前塔高３０米，占地面积１２万平方米。全塔用１０２５块花岗石和大理石砌成，象征着１０月２５日中国人民志愿军赴朝参战。
    推开塔背面一吨重的青铜大门，赵紫阳走进一座用大理石精致筑成的圆型石室。室中央一块黑色大理石石函里保存着志愿军烈士的名册。赵紫阳翻阅着两卷红皮精装的厚厚烈士名册，看到了一串串令人难忘的名字。他们是李湘、毛岸英、黄继光、罗盛教、邱少云……赵紫阳一面心情沉重地翻着名册，一面对吴学谦同志说：“山东、河北人牺牲的多。”
    看完烈士名册，赵紫阳一行又看了一下石室内墙壁上的三幅壁画。这是一组生动逼真的历史画卷：第一部分“参战篇”，反映了中国人民把自己最优秀的儿女派往朝鲜前线，高举“抗美援朝，保家卫国”的旗帜，渡过鸭绿江的动人情景；第二部分“战斗篇”，描绘了黄继光等战斗英雄同朝鲜人民并肩作战，打败美国侵略者的光辉业绩；第三部分“恢复建设篇”，记述了中国志愿军战后帮助朝鲜人民恢复和平建设，重建家园的感人事迹。
    赵紫阳走出石室，望了一下天空，挥笔在留言簿上写下了“用鲜血凝成的友谊万古长青”的题词。
    告别时，赵紫阳的眼圈微微有些发红，使在场的人无不深受感染。在庄严肃穆的友谊塔前，人们永远不会忘记塔座上镌刻的碑文：中国人民志愿军烈士们！你们高举抗美援朝保家卫国的旗帜，和我们并肩战斗在这块国土上，打败了共同的敌人。你们留下的不朽业绩，朝中人民用鲜血凝成的国际主义友谊，将在这块繁荣昌盛的土地上永放光辉。
