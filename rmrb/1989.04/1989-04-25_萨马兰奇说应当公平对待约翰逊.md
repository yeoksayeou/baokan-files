Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 24th.

International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Juan Antonio Samaranch said on April 23 in Barcelona, Spain, that Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson should be treated fairly and expressed his welcome for Johnson to participate in the 1992 Olympics to be held in Barcelona.

Samaranch was in Barcelona to attend the upcoming IOC Executive Committee meeting. When discussing Johnson's disqualification from the Seoul Olympics for using banned substances and the subsequent two-year suspension, Samaranch said, "When we decided to ban him from competing, we treated him the same as other athletes. Now we should also treat him the same way. It is not fair to impose more penalties on him just because he is Johnson."

When asked if he would welcome Johnson to compete in the Olympics again, Samaranch said, "Why not?"

One of the agenda items for this IOC Executive Committee meeting is to expedite the implementation of drug testing.

　　萨马兰奇说应当公平对待约翰逊
    新华社北京四月二十四日电  据外电报道，国际奥委会主席胡·萨马兰奇四月二十三日在西班牙巴塞罗那市说，应当公平对待加拿大短跑运动员本·约翰逊，并表示欢迎他参加一九九二年在巴塞罗那举行的奥运会。
    萨马兰奇是到巴塞罗那市参加即将举行的国际奥委会执委会会议的。在谈到约翰逊在汉城奥运会上因被查出服用禁用药物而被剥夺金牌和停赛两年一事时，萨马兰奇说：“我们当时决定禁止他参赛时，是把他和其他运动员同等对待的。现在我们也要这样对待他，不能因为他是约翰逊就要让他受到更多的处罚，那是不公平的。”
    有记者问萨马兰奇是否欢迎约翰逊重新参加奥运会比赛。萨马兰奇说：“为什么不欢迎呢？”
    这次国际奥委会执委会会议的议题之一就是加紧推行兴奋剂检查的问题。
