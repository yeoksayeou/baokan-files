South Africa and SWAPO Hold First Meeting
South Africa Releases SWAPO Prisoners

	New York, April 27 (Xinhua) — According to news from Windhoek today, South African officials and representatives of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) held their first meeting on Namibian territory on the 25th to discuss the issue of SWAPO guerrillas withdrawing to Angola.

	The South African Foreign Ministry spokesman confirmed this meeting yesterday, but as early as the 24th, South Africa denied reports of the meeting, saying the reports were "lies and malicious."

	Observers believe South Africa tried to block the news to prevent SWAPO's status in Namibia and the international community from being elevated due to this meeting.

	New York, April 16 (Xinhua) — South Africa today handed over 31 SWAPO guerrillas it had captured to the United Nations Transition Assistance Group in Namibia in the northern Namibian town of Oshakati.

	These SWAPO guerrillas were recently captured in armed clashes with South African forces in northern Namibia.

	A spokesman for the South African administrator in Namibia said that the South African security forces had captured a total of 35 SWAPO guerrillas, and the other 4 SWAPO guerrillas would be released soon.

　　南非与人组首次会晤    
    南非释放人组战俘
    新华社哈拉雷４月２７日电  据今天来自温得和克的消息，南非官员和西南非洲人民组织（“人组”）代表２５日首次在纳米比亚领土进行了会晤，讨论“人组”游击队撤回安哥拉的问题。
    南非外交部发言人昨天证实了这次会晤，但早在２４日，南非否认了关于将举行这次会晤的报道，并说这一报道是“谎言和别有用心的”。
    观察家认为南非试图封锁消息，以免由于这次会晤而提高“人组”在纳米比亚和国际社会的地位。
    新华社奥沙卡蒂（纳米比亚）４月１６日电　南非今天在纳米比亚北部城镇奥沙卡蒂将它俘虏的３１名西南非洲人民组织（人组）战士交给联合国纳米比亚过渡时期援助团。
    这些人组战士是最近在纳米比亚北部同南非部队的武装冲突中被俘的。
    南非驻纳米比亚行政长官的一位发言人说，南非治安部队总共俘获了３５名人组战士，另４名人组战士将很快被释放。
