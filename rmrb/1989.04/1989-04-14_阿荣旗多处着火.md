　　阿荣旗多处着火
    本报呼和浩特４月１３日电　记者傲腾报道：内蒙古防火指挥部今天２１点３０分报告：目前呼伦贝尔盟阿荣旗境内４个地方有火情。松树沟火场（东经１２３度１６分、北纬４８度５０分）和下间房火场（东经１２３度７分、北纬４８度７分）两个火场已连在一起，过火总面积达到２１平方公里。其中１５％的面积有次生林。现有１５４５人在扑打。
    温布棋预子火场（东经１２３度１５分、北纬４８度４１分）３个火线火势很大。过火面积为８平方公里，其中１０％的面积有次生林。第４个火场为温布棋沟（东经１２３度１１分、北纬４８度３４分）。这里的火势基本得到控制，过火面积约１５００亩。有林面积约占２０％。这几处火是１０日同一天因农田里焚烧麦茬子的火引起的。
