People in Europe are accustomed to calling organizations that advocate for ecological protection "Green Parties." The 5th Congress of the Green Parties of Western Europe was held from April 7th to 9th in Paris. Over 1,000 representatives from 20 countries attended, discussing major issues related to environmental protection in Europe and the world. The Green Parties of Western Europe, as a new political force, have gained significant attention with their large-scale activities and resolute actions.

Occupying seats in the European Parliament is a major goal for the Green Parties of Western Europe in the near future. The representatives at the congress have studied and determined a unified list of candidates for the Green Parties to participate in the European Parliament elections. Their goal is to secure 15 to 18 seats in the European Parliament (currently holding 9 seats) and strive to form a Green Party caucus within the European Parliament.

The Green Parties of Western Europe are preparing to expand their activities into the political arena. The four main topics discussed at this congress were: Europe in 1993, environmental protection, European citizens, and Europe's position in the world. A joint statement issued by the conference pointed out, "The future Europe should be an independent and autonomous region, without military alliances, and it should not be built into an economic and military 'new superpower.'" Analysts here believe that this proposal does not align with the European Community's plan to establish a unified market. Therefore, the role that the Green Parties will play in Europe's political and economic development remains to be seen.

The scale of this Green Party congress is unprecedented. Representatives from ecological organizations in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, North America, South America, and Africa were also invited to attend. The congress emphasized breaking down the barriers between Eastern and Western Europe, advocating for environmental protection as a global common task. A representative stated in his speech that the right to human survival is the primary right, and the world should strive for disarmament, peace, environmental protection, and reducing the wealth gap between the South and the North.

The first congress of the Green Parties of Western Europe was held in Belgium in 1984. Over the past five years, the ecological movement in Western Europe has been on the rise. Currently, 10 countries in Western Europe have Green Parties represented in their national parliaments. In the March municipal elections in France, out of the 3,000 candidates fielded by the Green Party, 1,800 were elected to municipal councils.

In just a few years, the Green Party's strength has rapidly increased, mainly due to two reasons: First, the Green Party has responded to the challenge of ecological imbalance faced by humanity. Europe is a region with advanced industry, and the technological revolution has brought both progress and prosperity, as well as disastrous environmental destruction. The Green Party's emergence in the Western European political arena is because, compared to traditional parties, it places more emphasis on environmental issues and takes on the responsibility of solving environmental problems. Second, from the perspective of democratic political processes in various Western European countries, the competition between left-wing and right-wing parties is gradually losing its appeal to voters. The unique political views and independent political slogans proposed by the Green Party, however, are quite attractive to voters. Voters feel that the Green Party might be able to do something for them through its environmental protection platform.

As a newcomer to the Western European political arena, the Green Party's strength and influence are still limited. The electoral laws of some countries are also unfavorable to new and small parties, so the development of the Green Party will not be smooth sailing. However, there is reason to believe that as environmental issues become increasingly important, the strength of the Green Parties in Western Europe will continue to grow.

### 生态运动与西欧绿党兴起

　　生态运动与西欧绿党兴起
　　本报记者　张启华
    欧洲人习惯于把保护生态运动的组织称为绿党。西欧第5届绿党代表大会于本月7日至9日在巴黎召开，与会的有20个国家的1000多名代表，他们讨论了欧洲及世界保护环境的有关重大问题。西欧绿党作为一股新的政治力量，以其浩大的声势和行动决心，令人刮目相看。
    占领欧洲议会讲坛是西欧绿党近期斗争的主要目标。与会代表已研究并确定了参加欧洲议会选举的绿党的统一竞选名单，他们的目标是夺取15至18个欧洲议会席位（现有9个席位），争取在欧洲议会中组成绿党议员小组。
    西欧绿党准备将其活动范围扩大到政治领域。这次大会的四项主要议题是：1993年的欧洲、环境保护、欧洲公民以及欧洲在世界的地位。会议发表的一项共同声明中指出，
  “未来的欧洲应该成为一个独立自主的地区，不要军事联盟，也不能把欧洲建成为一个经济、军事上的“新的超级大国”。此间分析家认为，这个提法与欧共体关于建立统一大市场的纲领不合拍，因此，绿党在欧洲政治、经济发展中究竟将扮演什么角色，还有待观察。
    这次绿党代表大会的声势是前所未有的。应邀参加这次大会的还有苏联、东欧、北美、南美、非洲一些国家的生态组织代表。大会强调要打破东西欧的界限，要求把环境保护作为一个全球性的共同任务。一位代表在发言中指出，人类生存的权利是首要的权利，全世界都应为裁军、和平、环保、缩小南北之间贫富差距而努力奋斗。
    第一届西欧绿党大会是1984年在比利时召开的。5年来，西欧生态运动一直处在上升状态。目前，西欧已有10个国家的绿党进入本国的议会。在3月举行的法国市镇选举中，绿党推出的3000名候选人中，竟有1800名进入市镇议会。
    短短几年内，绿党的力量迅速上升，主要有两个原因：一是绿党回答了人类面临的生态不平衡的挑战。欧洲是世界工业发达的地区，科技革命给欧洲带来了进步和繁荣，也带来了灾难性的环境破坏。绿党在西欧政坛上异军突起，是因为比起传统的政党，它更加重视环保问题，把解决环保问题作为己任。二是从西欧各国的民主政治进程看，左、右翼的党派之争，对选举逐渐失去吸引力，绿党提出的独特政见和独立自主的政治口号，却颇能吸引选民。选民从绿党的环保纲领中，感到绿党也许能为他们办点实事。
    作为西欧政坛上的新秀，绿党的力量和影响还是有限的。一些国家的选举法对新兴的小党也很不利，所以绿党的发展并不会一帆风顺。但人们有理由相信，在环保问题越来越被重视的今天，西欧绿党的力量将进一步壮大。
