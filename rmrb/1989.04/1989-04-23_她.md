	She
	Li Peizhi

	At that time, I was very young and full of joy, always wanting to sing.
	My mother-in-law lived on the other side of the building, and I lived on this side, so I wasn't afraid she would hear me. But in the summer evenings, the courtyard below was filled with people cooling off, and I would still sing loudly in my room. My mother-in-law must have heard me.
	Because I was young, I didn't know that others might gossip, or perhaps I simply didn't realize that there were so many people around me, so many different voices. What made me happiest was that across the building, there was another singing enthusiast, just like me, hiding behind the delicate curtains of a glass window, singing freely.
	I didn't know who she was. I imagined she was very young and beautiful, because her voice was clear and resonant, very pleasant to hear. It seemed as if we had an unspoken agreement: whenever I started singing, she would join in; whenever she began, I would sing along. So, day after day, we sang together, one from the south and one from the north, one high and one low, one restrained and one exuberant, one soft and one strong... like harmonizing... Our voices would fly through the corridors, collide in the air and among the treetops. Communicating with an unseen friend, someone I had never met, through song, was quite enjoyable for me.
	Until one period, I no longer heard her singing, and I asked the neighbors about her. It turned out she was a lab technician at the factory, and because of a divorce, she had moved away.
	"She was so reckless, so irresponsible..." I heard such comments by the public washing area.
	Was it because she sang that she was talked about like this? Was it because she sang that she got divorced? I was quite shocked.
	Singing alone felt lonely. After hearing those comments, I also felt a bit uncomfortable. Later, a television was set up downstairs, and in the evenings, it would attract a full crowd of people. I also didn't dare sing upstairs anymore.
	Sometimes I think of her and regret that I never saw what she was like. I had never gone to that building. Living there for over a decade, I had never crossed this courtyard... You say the world is vast, and you can't visit every place; you say life is fleeting, and you can't understand everyone, but this courtyard, not even fifteen meters wide, separating neighbors, is something you can never cross in your lifetime?
	Unknowingly, I also stopped singing. But sometimes, when I think of her, I still believe she is singing. Every evening, behind the delicate curtains, she is singing...

　　她
    李佩芝
    那时我很年轻，很快活，总想唱歌。
    婆婆在楼那头，我住楼这头，不怕她听见。但在夏天的黄昏，楼下坐满了乘凉的人，我依旧在房里快活地唱，婆婆是一定听见了。
    因为年轻，不知道别人会议论，也许根本就没有意识到身边还有众多的人，还有许许多多异样的声音。最使我高兴的是对面楼上也有个歌迷，和我一样，躲在玻璃窗淡雅的帘儿后面，飞飞扬扬地唱。
    我不知道那是谁。我猜想她很年轻，并且很漂亮，因为她的歌声清丽，有穿透力，很好听。仿佛有种默契似的，每到黄昏，我这边一开口，她那边便扬声；她那一放嗓，我这便唱歌。于是，天天一南一北地唱，一高一低地唱，一抑一扬地唱，一柔一刚地唱……如同和声般……歌声在楼道间旋飞，在空气树梢间碰撞，与一位不曾露面的朋友，素不相识的朋友用歌声交谈，于我很有点滋味。
    直到一个时期，听不见她的歌声了，我才向邻居打问。原来她是这个工厂的化验员，因为闹离婚，搬走了。
    “照她那样子，轻狂得很，不正经……”洗衣洗菜的公共水池边，听到这种议论。
    莫非因为唱歌才这样被人谈么？莫非因为唱歌才离婚么？我有些吃惊。
    一个人唱，有些寂寥。听过那评议，也有些不自在。后来楼下又设了电视，黄昏时便吸引了满满一片人，我也不好意思在楼上唱了。
    有时想起她，难免遗憾，她是什么样的呢？我从没有到那座楼上去过。住了十几年，没有越过这楼前的空地……你说世界茫茫，你无从一一涉足；你说人生匆匆，你无法个个理解，但这邻居之间不足十五米宽的空地竟是毕生不能逾越的么？
    我在不知不觉中也忘记歌唱了。不过，有时想起她，却总认为她还在歌唱。天天黄昏，在淡雅的窗帘后面歌唱……
