The town of Erlang in Guanyin County, Sichuan, is nestled among towering mountains and steep cliffs, adjacent to the Red Water River. It faces the town of Langmiao in Huichuan District, Guizhou, across the river. Due to the deep and swift currents of the Red Water River, crossing by boat is extremely dangerous. In October 1987, relevant departments in our province invested 1.2 million yuan to start building a bridge. In just one year, the Erlang Highway Bridge was completed over the Red Water River. Now, the roads in Sichuan have been connected to the Erlang Bridge, but the roads in Guizhou are still 430 meters away from being connected to the bridge. Therefore, the bridge's full potential has not been realized. Currently, the Lang Wine Factory in Guanyin is willing to cover the entire cost of building this section of the road. However, due to certain reasons, this section of the road has not been completed yet.

We appeal to the relevant departments in Sichuan and Guizhou provinces to promptly address this matter and ensure smooth road transportation between the two provinces.

　　不忘兄弟情　断路快接通
    四川古蔺县二郎镇位于崇山峻岭之中，紧靠赤水河，与贵州习水县回龙区郎庙乡隔河相望。由于赤水河水深流急，渡船过河十分危险。1987年10月，我省有关部门集资120万元，动工修桥。仅用一年时间，赤水河上就建起了二郎公路大桥。如今，四川境内的公路已经与二郎大桥连接在一起，可是贵州境内的公路距二郎大桥还差430米未修通，因此未能很好地发挥大桥的效益。目前，古蔺郎酒厂愿意承担修建这段公路的全部费用。但由于一些原因，这段公路至今未能建成。
    呼吁四川、贵州两省有关部门尽快过问这件事情，使两省之间的这条公路运输畅通无阻。
