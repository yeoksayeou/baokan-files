People's Daily, Tokyo, April 13th - Correspondent Yu Qing reports: Today in the afternoon, Premier Li Peng and his delegation arrived by helicopter at Japan's largest steel mill, the Kisarazu Steel Works in Chiba Prefecture, for a visit. They were warmly welcomed by President Yuji Saito of the Nippon Steel Corporation and the workers of the factory.

The hosts and guests boarded a large car and drove into the factory. President Saito delivered a welcome speech inside the car. Then, the factory's responsible officials introduced the factory's situation to Li Peng. The Kisarazu Steel Works covers an area of over 10 million square meters, with more than 6,800 employees, and produces nearly 6 million tons of crude steel annually. Li Peng asked about the proportion of land reclaimed from the sea within the factory's total area. The reply was 100%. Li Peng then inquired about the factory's energy consumption. The factory officials explained that energy consumption accounts for about 1% of Japan's total energy consumption. Li Peng asked about the proportion of green areas within the factory. The reply was 16%.

Li Peng and his wife first visited the No. 4 blast furnace. The director of the iron-making plant gave an introduction. The No. 4 blast furnace is the largest in the factory, with a volume of 5,151 cubic meters and a height of 124 meters, producing 11,000 tons of iron per day. It is the third-largest blast furnace in the world, with all operations controlled by electronic computers. Premier Li Peng asked technical questions about the carbon content in iron and learned about the relationship between automation and worker quality.

Subsequently, Li Peng and his delegation visited the hot rolling mill and the cold rolling mill. Along the way, Li Peng inquired in detail about production and technical issues, personally touching the steel plates used for car bodies and the rolled steel coils, expressing admiration for the achievements of modernized production. Vice President Yamamoto of Nippon Steel Corporation told the reporter that the questions raised by Premier Li Peng were highly specialized, far beyond our expectations. He is indeed a rare statesman in the world who is familiar with the steel industry.

After the visit, Li Peng inscribed a message for the factory: "Enhance cooperation and exchange between China and Japan in the steel industry."
