Observation Post:

According to a recent survey by our province's statistics bureau of 75 village groups in 15 counties and cities, the shortage of draft cattle in some rural areas is an urgent problem that needs to be addressed as spring plowing approaches. The 75 village groups need 736 head of cattle for spring production, but only 594 head are currently available for use. By the end of 1988, Xiangtan County had 11.6% fewer cattle than the same period the previous year, and the number of usable cattle was half of what was needed.

The main reasons for the cattle shortage are as follows: after the implementation of the responsibility system, cattle were distributed to farmers for joint feeding and use. Some households only used the cattle without taking good care of them, resulting in frequent non-natural deaths. Additionally, since winter, the market price of beef has risen repeatedly, and some farmers, focusing on immediate gains, have slaughtered and sold usable cattle. According to a survey in Jizhou Village, Lixian County, 11 head of cattle were slaughtered and sold since winter, accounting for 12.2% of the usable cattle. The agricultural market in Chengguan Town, Xinning County, sees 6 head of cattle slaughtered and sold daily. It is urgent to address the cattle shortage.

I work as a statistician in the bureau. The final totals on the statistical tables on my desk cause me concern: currently, one-third of the households in Yusheng Village do not have cattle, leading to a severe shortage of draft power and manure for spring production.

The main reasons for this situation are as follows: first, policy errors have led to a focus on industry and commerce while neglecting agriculture and animal husbandry, making it difficult for the cattle industry to develop; second, our area has suffered from consecutive disasters, leading to reduced agricultural output, and some households have had to sell their cattle to buy grain to survive; third, the freezing temperatures and diseases since last winter have resulted in the death of some cattle.

Households without cattle and some long-serving rural officials have called on relevant departments to take immediate measures to address the urgent need for spring production in our county.

### 农村养牛少　春耕畜力缺

　　农村养牛少　春耕畜力缺
    （一）
    据我省统计局最近对１５个县市的７５个村民小组的耕牛情况的调查，春耕在即，部分农村耕牛紧缺问题急待解决。７５个村民小组今年春耕生产需要耕牛７３６头，而现有能使用的只有５９４头，湘潭县１９８８年末全县实有耕牛比上年同期减少１１．６％，能使用的５头，与需要量相差一半。
    造成耕牛紧缺的原因主要是，实行责任制后，耕牛分给农民联合饲养、使用。一些农户只使用，不好好饲养，致使耕牛非正常死亡屡屡出现。另外，入冬以来市场牛肉价格一涨再涨，部分农民只顾眼前利益，将能使用的耕牛宰杀出售。据澧县九垸乡集中村调查，入冬以来宰杀出售耕牛１１头，占使用耕牛的１２．２％。新宁县城关镇农贸市场每天上市宰杀耕牛６头。及时解决耕牛紧缺的问题已迫在眉睫。

    我在局里任统计员。眼前办公桌上统计表的最终合计，令我忧虑：玉屏农村现在有１／３的农户没有养牛，春耕生产的畜力和厩肥严重短缺。
    据了解，导致这一状况的主要原因，一是政策失误，近几年从上到下重工商轻农牧，使得养牛业的发展举步维艰；二是我们这里连年遭灾，农业减产，一些农户只好忍痛卖掉耕牛买粮度荒；三是去年入冬以来的凌冻和疫病，造成一些耕牛倒冬或病死。
    无牛户和一些多年从事农村工作的干部，呼吁有关部门尽快采取措施，解决我县春耕生产的燃眉之急。
