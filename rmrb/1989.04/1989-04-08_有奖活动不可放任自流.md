Prize Activities Should Not Be Left Unregulated

Currently, prize savings and prize sales activities are widespread. Reasonable and well-organized prize savings activities have played a positive role in circulating currency, effectively utilizing idle social funds, and curbing inflation. However, some problems in these activities cannot be ignored. In the past week, our newspaper has received over 20 letters from readers in Liaoning, Henan, Hebei, Shaanxi, Gansu, Shandong, Shanxi, Beijing, Fujian, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Hunan, reflecting issues in prize savings and prize sales activities.

Excessive Tickets and Poor Management

In Shaanxi's Zhouzhi County, Zhouzhi Town's Wang Tongmou reported that within just one month, banks and credit unions in the county held hundreds of "instant" prize savings events. Some events were held every market day, three times a week; others were even held at rural temple fairs. Some wholesale departments and stores also jumped on the bandwagon, using prize activities to sell stagnant goods.

In Liaoning's Jinzhou City, Wang Weiguo reported that at the end of February, the Jinzhou Construction Bank held a prize savings event. During the lottery draw, management was lax, and the lottery machine produced a ball without a number, which was discovered by the crowd present. This incident led thousands of people to petition the city government, resulting in a loss of 270,000 yuan for the state.

In Fujian's Shaowu City, Shao Min and Wu Zhong reported that due to poor management, the urban branch of the Agricultural Bank of China in Shaowu City rushed into the prize savings event, with sloppy work and negligent staff, leading to the cancellation of the lottery draw, refunds, and prize withdrawals. This eventually angered the public.

Some readers' letters pointed out that since some prize savings activities are organized by collective or individual units, it is difficult to ensure supervision, certification, and confidentiality, providing opportunities for those who seek to profit from it. Investigations show that many prize savings activities lack strict management, leading to an excess of tickets. This not only brings difficulties to normal prize savings activities but also damages the government's image and the interests of consumers, creating a negative social impact.

Fraud and Deception of the Public

In a certain county in Liaoning, Peng Deyu and Peng Yajuan from the Industrial and Commercial Bureau reported that on March 15, the Agricultural Bank of that county engaged in fraud, with almost all the prize tickets sold but a large pile of prizes left on the ground. In the end, an individual merchant bought the remaining 23 prize tickets for 690 yuan, but none of them won. The 500-plus crowd present erupted in anger, strongly demanding a refund of the prize tickets. In a certain city in Shanxi, Feng Zhihui from the Science and Technology Association reported that on March 1, the urban branch of the Insurance Company held a prize family property insurance event. With almost all the prize tickets sold, the large prizes remained untouched. In the end, one person bought the remaining 60 prize tickets in one go, but none of them won. The crowd present was outraged by this blatant deception.

In a certain city in Hebei, Ding Yi, an employee of the Department Store, reported that the staff selling charity prize tickets from the Civil Affairs Bureau colluded with relatives and friends to provide winning tickets and share the prize money.

Corrupting Minds and Harmful Trends

In Henan's Gushi County, Duan Kai from the Labor Service Company reported that currently, the trend of lottery draws is rampant, with various banks competing to hold events, and prizes escalating from bicycles, tape recorders, and spring mattresses to color TVs and houses. In an instant, the city was abuzz, and the scene was magnificent. Many people spent their days and nights participating in lottery draws, with lines stretching hundreds of meters. Winners were overjoyed, while losers accepted their bad luck. Some children even spent their red envelope money on lottery draws. This form of gambling has seriously harmed social order, children's psychology, and family life.

In Gansu's Pingliang City, Li Yong reported that the lottery draw activities popular in many places have fueled and catered to people's gambling mentality. A couple, on the eve of their wedding, had the groom spend a thousand yuan in one go to try to win a color TV. In the end, he didn't win the TV, and the couple parted ways unhappily. Some people, to obtain prizes, burned incense and paper, praying to the gods for blessings. Some people, blinded by greed, altered ticket numbers to claim large prizes. Additionally, lottery draw points were crowded, with unsightly scenes and obstructed traffic; some hooligans and thieves took the opportunity to cause trouble.

In Hunan's Zhijiang Dong Autonomous County, Wu Xue reported that in Zhijiang, a street less than 1,000 meters long had five or six lottery draw points, making the street chaotic. Winners didn't stop, and losers wanted to recoup their losses. One person exchanged 400 yuan worth of unwinning savings prize tickets for 200 yuan in cash to buy more tickets, but still didn't win. He then exchanged 200 yuan worth of savings prize tickets for 100 yuan to buy more tickets, until he left empty-handed. Some farmers stopped spring plowing and rushed to the city to participate in lottery draws.

In Shaanxi's Xi'an Machine Tool Factory, Zhao Huaiqian appealed, "Don't let gambling consciousness infect children." He said that on March 11, his two daughters came home from school and asked for 20 yuan, saying they were participating in a prize savings travel event organized by the Municipal Committee and the Municipal Federation of Youth. They were intoxicated by the illusory allure, constantly planning their grand schemes after winning, and had no heart for their homework. He believed it was inappropriate to involve primary school students in such activities.

Ineffective Results and Need for Cooling Down

In Hebei's Huai'an County, Wang Xiaolin from the Industrial and Commercial Bank reported that financial institutions in Huai'an County competed to hold "incentive savings" to attract deposits. This is essentially a disguised increase in savings deposit interest rates, which will inevitably increase bank costs and reduce state fiscal revenue. This destructive competition among financial institutions to raise prize money has brought disorder to the financial order, causing savings deposits to move around. Some financial personnel also used large amounts of public funds to participate in prize savings, embezzling for personal gain.

Some letters reported that some banks and credit unions were busy all day preparing for prize savings, while their business halls remained closed, affecting daily deposit and withdrawal services. This frustrated people who needed to deposit or withdraw money, further intensifying the public's panic over inflation and price increases. Some people with spare money didn't want to save it anymore.

### 有奖活动不可放任自流

专栏：来信综述

　　有奖活动不可放任自流
    目前，有奖储蓄、有奖销售的活动开展十分普遍，合理的、组织得当的有奖储蓄活动对回笼货币，有效利用社会闲散资金，抑制通货膨胀起到了积极作用。但是，这类活动中的一些问题也不容忽视。最近一周内，本报收到了辽宁、河南、河北、陕西、甘肃、山东、山西、北京、福建、广东、浙江、湖南等地的读者来信２０多封，反映有奖储蓄、有奖销售活动中的问题。
    奖券泛滥　管理失控
    陕西周至县哑柏镇王同谋说，周至县在短短一个月内，银行、信用社等单位举办各类“即开型”有奖储蓄上百次。有的逢集就搞，三天一次；有的还在农村庙会上搞。一些商业批发部和商店也红了眼，利用有奖活动推销滞销商品。
    辽宁锦州市王维国说，２月底，锦州市建设银行搞有奖储蓄，在摇奖中疏于管理，摇奖机竟出现了无号码球，被在场群众发现。致使数千名群众到市政府上访。此事使国家损失了２７万元。
    福建邵武市邵民、武众说，由于管理混乱，邵武市农业银行城关储蓄所的有奖储蓄仓促上阵，工作搞得很不严密，工作人员失职，导致此次摸奖作废，退单、退款、退奖。最后，引起了群众的愤怒。
    一些读者来信说，由于有些有奖储蓄活动是一些集体、个体单位主办，故监督、公证、保密的工作很难做好，给从中渔利者留下了可乘之机。据调查，不少有奖储蓄活动缺乏严格管理，造成奖券泛滥，不但给正常的有奖储蓄带来困难，还损害了政府的形象和消费者的利益，造成恶劣的社会影响。
    营私舞弊　欺骗群众
    辽宁某县工商局庞德余、庞亚娟来信说，３月１５日，这个县农业银行弄虚作假，奖券快卖完了，地上摆的奖品还剩一大堆。最后，一名个体户花６９０元买下剩下的２３张奖券，但没有１张中奖。在场的５００多群众炸雷般地轰动起来，强烈要求退奖券。山西某市科协冯智慧说，３月１日，市城区保险公司搞有奖家庭财产保险，几万张奖券快卖完了，大件奖品仍岿然不动。最后一人一次买下剩余的６０张奖券，却无一中奖。在场的群众对这种明目张胆的欺骗行为十分愤慨。
    河北某市百货大楼职工丁一说，市民政局发售募捐奖券人员，竟与亲朋好友内外勾结，提供中奖券，分拿奖金。
    毒化心灵　有害风气
    河南固始县劳动服务公司段凯说，眼下，摸奖之风盛行，各银行竞相举办，奖品随之升级，从自行车、录音机、席梦思床到彩电、住宅。一时间，满城轰动，场面壮观。不少人白天晚上忙着摸奖，摸奖的长龙达百米。中奖者乐昏头脑，“手臭”者自认倒霉。一些孩子也把压岁钱全拿来摸奖。这种变相赌博，给社会治安、少儿心理、家庭生活以严重损害。
    甘肃平凉市李永说，风靡许多地方的摸奖活动，助长和迎合了人们的侥幸心理。一对恋人在喜结良缘前夕，小伙子为捞彩电，一次抛出千元。结果彩电没捞到，倒使恋人不欢而散。有的人为了得到奖品，燃香烧纸，祈求神灵保佑。有的人财迷心窍，涂改奖券号码，冒领大奖。另外，摸奖点人满为患、丑态百出，阻塞交通；一些流氓小偷乘机寻衅滋事。
    湖南芷江侗族自治县伍晰说，芷江一条不足１０００米的街上，摸奖点达五六个，搞得街上乌烟瘴气。中了奖的不罢手，未中奖的想捞本。有一人将未中奖的４００元储蓄奖券换成２００元现金再去买奖券，可仍未中奖，他又将２００元储蓄奖券换成１００元钱买奖券，直至空手而回。一些农民停止春耕，拥进城来摸奖。
    陕西西安机床厂赵怀憎呼吁：“不要让赌博意识染指儿童。”他说，３月１１日，两个女儿放学回来向他要了２０元钱，说是参加团市委和市青联组织的有奖储蓄旅游。她们被虚幻的诱惑所陶醉，一个劲地规划中奖后的宏图，无心做家庭作业。他认为，让小学生介入这类活动很不妥当。
    效果不佳　应该降温
    河北怀安县工商银行王小林来信谈到：怀安县金融机构为吸引存款，竞相搞“奖励储蓄”。这实质上是变相提高储蓄存款利率，必将导致银行成本加大，国家财政收入减少。而这种金融机构竞相抬高奖金的破坏性竞争，带来了金融秩序的混乱，造成储蓄存款搬家。少数财会人员还以巨额公款参加有奖储蓄，中饱私囊。
    有的来信反映，有的银行、信用社为筹办有奖储蓄成天忙碌，营业所反而不开门，影响日常存取业务，急得要存取款的人怨气冲冲，更加剧了群众对通货膨胀、物价上涨的恐慌心理。有些人有余钱想存款也不存了。
