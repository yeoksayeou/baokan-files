Column: Literary Scene

The old poet Yan Zhen, who grew up and learned poetry amidst the smoke of the War of Resistance, gained fame in the early 1950s. To date, he has published 22 poetry collections, three novels, and one essay collection. His epic poem "Mountain Vows," which underwent five revisions and spans nearly 20,000 lines, and his novel "Emotional Thief" are both scheduled to be published as tribute works for the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation. Last year, he and poets such as Zhang Zhimin were invited to participate in the 10th "World Poets Conference" held in Bangkok, Thailand.

On a chilly spring afternoon, I visited Yan Zhen's modest study. The scholarly Yan Zhen spoke slowly and deliberately, his thick Laiyang accent from Shandong Province sounding particularly warm and familiar. Although he only attended school for six years, decades of literary practice and life experience have given him unique insights and perceptions on many issues.

In a sense, Yan Zhen is a poet who sings his songs for the farmers. His famous works from the early 1950s, such as "Old Zhang's Hands" and "Golden Phoenix," passionately praised the farmers' joy of liberation and reflected their complex psychological changes during the agricultural collectivization movement. These works sang of their love for the new life and their desire to build a new life.

From the late 1950s to the early 1960s, the poet, whose thoughts flowed like a spring, published several poetry collections. Among them, collections like "Jiangnan Melodies" and "Bamboo and Thatched Roofs" used vivid, colorful, and emotional brushstrokes to delicately depict the diverse scenery of Jiangnan, providing readers with a beautiful artistic experience.

In recent years, China's new poetry creation has flourished, with various styles and schools of poetry emerging in large quantities. Particularly, a batch of young explorers with abundant talent have emerged, enriching the poetic garden with their profound thoughts and weighty poems, while also challenging poetic traditions.

Facing this colorful poetic spring, Yan Zhen, who once moved countless young people with his poetic lines, was deeply moved. He did not remain indifferent to the young friends who disagreed with his creative proposals; instead, he enthusiastically encouraged exploration, nurtured young talent, and loudly called for a broader free space for the younger generation in every possible forum. In his self-edited "Poetry Newspaper" and other publications, he consecutively published articles such as "The Yangtze River Calls for Brave Drifters," "All-Directional Writing and Stirring of Modern Poetry," and "Defending Young Poets," which are filled with philosophical and emotional colors, winning the understanding of the young people.

### 老诗人严阵与青年

　　老诗人严阵与青年
    张少中
    在抗战的硝烟中成长、学诗，５０年代初成名的诗人严阵，迄今已有２２本诗集和三本小说及一本散文集面世。五易其稿的近两万行的诗体长篇小说《山盟》和长篇小说《情贼》作为建国４０周年的献礼作品也即将出版。去年，他和张志民等几位诗人应邀首次参加了在泰国曼谷举行的第１０届“世界诗人大会”。
    在一个春寒料峭的午后，我来到了严阵那间不甚宽敞的书房。儒雅的严阵说话慢条斯理，浓重的山东莱阳乡音听起来倍感亲切。他虽然仅读过６年书，但几十年的文学实践和人生阅历使他在许多问题上都有自己的独到见解和感悟。
    从某种意义上说，严阵是把自己的歌唱给农民的诗人。５０年代初期的成名作《老张的手》和《金色的凤凰》等，满腔热情地颂扬了农民的翻身喜悦，反映了他们在农业合作化运动中复杂的心理变化，唱出了他们热爱新生活、建设新生活的心声。
    ５０年代末至６０年代初，思若泉涌的诗人接连出版了数本诗集。其中的《江南曲》、《竹茅》等诗集以有声、有色、有情的笔触，细腻地展现出多姿多彩的江南风物，给读者以美的艺术享受。
    近年来，我国的新诗创作出现了繁荣局面，各种风格和流派的诗作大量涌现，尤其是崭露出一批又一批才情横溢的年轻探索者，他们以自己深刻的思索和厚重的诗篇为诗的园地添彩增异，同时也向诗的传统提出了挑战。
    面对着这色彩缤纷的诗的春天，曾以自己的诗行感动过万千青年的严阵深深地感动了。他不因青年朋友有悖于自己的创作主张而冷漠，相反，他在一切能讲话的场合都曾热情的鼓励探索，奖掖后生，大声疾呼要给青年一代更广阔的自由天地。他在自己主编的《诗歌报》和其他报刊上，接连发表了诸如《诗长江呼唤着勇敢的漂流者》、《现代诗全方位的写法和骚动》、《为青年诗人辩护》等充满着思辨色彩和情感色彩的文章，赢得了年轻人的理解。
