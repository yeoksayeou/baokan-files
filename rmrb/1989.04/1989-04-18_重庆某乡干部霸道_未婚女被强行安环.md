The recent incident in Dazhu County, Chongqing, where local officials forcibly implanted an IUD in an unmarried young woman, has been severely dealt with. The relevant personnel have received disciplinary actions according to party, administrative, and legal regulations.

The incident occurred on December 19, 1988. A young woman from Dazhu County, Wu, returned happily from Jiangxi. She was on vacation from her job outside the village. The county's family planning propaganda team saw Wu return and insisted that she had "illegally married" outside. Wu repeatedly declared that she was unmarried, but the local officials still ordered her to the county government for examination.

At the county government courtyard, the family planning census taker examined Wu and confirmed that she was indeed unmarried and not pregnant. However, some local officials absurdly reasoned, "After being out for so long, how could she not be pregnant?" They insisted on implanting an IUD in Wu. The next day, she was taken to the county health clinic, where the gynecologist examined her again, concluding that she was still unmarried. However, Deputy County Head Fu insisted, "Whether married or not, if she's not pregnant, she must have an IUD implanted!" The doctor said, "She is menstruating, and according to regulations, an IUD cannot be implanted. Besides, she is still a girl." Fu flew into a rage: "Whether it can be implanted or not, it must be done!" Wu cried uncontrollably. The propaganda team leader shouted, "Why are you crying? Getting an IUD is nothing special! We'll implant the IUD now, and when you reach childbearing age, we'll remove it for you!" As a result, Wu was forcibly implanted with an IUD.

It is understood that the members of the "propaganda team" were mostly temporary farmers drafted for the task. To meet their "completion targets," they violated laws and regulations, causing physical and mental harm to the victim. Under strong public demand, the relevant departments of Dazhu County promptly handled this incident.

　　重庆某乡干部霸道　未婚女被强行安环
    本报讯　重庆市大足县发生的乡干部强行给未婚女青年安环一事，最近受到严肃处理，有关人员分别受到党纪政纪法纪的处分。
    事情发生在１９８８年１２月１９日。大足县农村女青年伍某，高高兴兴从江西返回本乡，她是外出做工回村休假的。乡计划生育宣传队见伍某回来，一口咬定她在外地“非法结婚”。伍某再三申辩“未婚”，但乡干部仍强令她到乡政府接受检查。
    在乡政府大院，计划生育普查员对伍某作了检查，证实她果真未婚，更没有怀孕。但某些乡干部却荒唐地推理说：“外出这么久，哪有不怀孕的？”坚持要给伍某安环。第二天，她被带到乡卫生院，由妇产科医生再次进行检查，其结论仍是“未婚”。然而副乡长傅某却不顾事实，公然下令：“不管结婚没结婚，没怀娃儿就马上安环！”医生说：“她正来月经，按规定不能安环。何况人家还是个姑娘。”傅某大发雷霆：“管它安得安不得，都要给我安上去！”伍某哭泣不已。乡宣传队负责人吼道：“你哭啥子？给你安个环有啥稀罕？把环安起，等你到了生育年龄，再给你取了就是嘛！”结果，伍某被强行安上了“节育环”。
    据了解，这个“宣传队”的队员，大多数是临时抽调的农民。他们为了硬凑“完成指标”，竟违法乱纪，致使受害人身心遭到损害。在群众的强烈要求下，大足县有关部门及时查处了这起事件。
