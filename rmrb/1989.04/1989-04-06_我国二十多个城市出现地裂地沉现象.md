	China has experienced ground fissures or land subsidence in more than 20 cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Xi'an. In a recent article in "China Geology News," Nong Kaicheng, deputy director of the Geological Environment Management Bureau of the Ministry of Geology, pointed out that ground fissures and subsidence are closely related to active faults, and excessive extraction of groundwater is one of the main causes. To prevent and control ground fissures and land subsidence, the first step is to rationally exploit groundwater, reduce the amount of groundwater extraction, and form a benign cycle; the second step is to strengthen groundwater management; the third step is to adopt the method of replenishment to "treat" the "affected areas" of ground fissures and land subsidence. Shanghai currently injects about 2,000 million tons of water into the ground each year, and land subsidence has been basically controlled. At present, cities such as Tianjin and Changzhou have also implemented replenishment measures.

　　我国二十多个城市出现地裂地沉现象
    本报讯  中国已有包括北京、上海、天津、西安在内的２０多个城市发生地裂或地面沉降。地质部地质环境管理司副司长农开清就这一现象，近日在《中国地质报》上撰文指出，地裂地沉与活动断裂有密切关系，过量开采地下水也是主要原因之一。防治地裂、地面沉降，首先是要合理开采地下水，减少地下水的提取量，形成良性循环；第二是要加强地下水管理；第三是采取回灌方式“治疗”地裂和地面沉降“患部”。上海现在每年向地下回灌约２０００万吨水，地面沉降基本上控制住了。目前，天津、常州等城市也搞了回灌。
