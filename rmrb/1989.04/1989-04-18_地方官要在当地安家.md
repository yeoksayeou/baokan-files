According to a report in People's Daily: A batch of section and bureau-level cadres from the provincial organs of Hubei, along with their families, have gone to prefectures, cities, and counties to take up leading positions. Reading this news, I was deeply moved.

Hubei's measure is beneficial in two ways. First, it helps to overcome temporary thinking and short-term behavior. Once the cadres go down to the prefectures, cities, and counties to take up leading positions, if their families do not go with them, they will inevitably have divided loyalties, worrying about both family and the people. During festivals and holidays, they might take care of the family but neglect the people, or take care of the people but neglect the family. Some people might only view their assignment as a way to "gain experience," intending to stay for a couple of years and then return to the provincial capital to secure a better position. With such a mindset, they cannot achieve much in their work. Bringing the family down and transferring the household registration helps the cadres to focus all their energy on their work. Second, it helps to strengthen the relationship between cadres and the masses. In the past, some cadres, being alone, lived in hotels, ate at restaurants, and incurred significant housing expenses. Moreover, the common people felt that there was a barrier between them and the leaders. Now that the leading cadres have settled their families in the official dormitories, they can listen more to the voices from the grassroots and the masses. Cadres who are dedicated to working together with the local cadres and the masses will have a place to showcase their talents.

　　地方官要在当地安家
　　连时
    据人民日报报道：湖北省直机关一批处科级干部携家带口，到地市县担任领导职务。读了这条新闻，很有感触。
    湖北的这项措施一是有利于克服临时观点和短期行为。人下去了，到地市县担任领导工作了，家属不同时去，就免不了心挂两头，逢年过节顾了家顾不了“民”，顾了“民”顾不了家。有的人只不过是把下去当成“镀金”，想熬个二三年，再回省城谋个好位子。有了这种精神状态，工作上也就不可能有所建树。把家属带下去，户口转下去，有利于下去的同志把全部心思都扑在工作上。二是有利于密切干群关系。过去由于某些干部孤身一人，住的是宾馆，吃的是客饭，房租开支不少，而且老百姓觉得与领导者“隔了一层”。如今领导干部把家安在机关宿舍里，就可以比较多地倾听到来自基层和群众的声音。一心同当地干部群众打成一片的干部也就有了用武之地。
