	Xinhua News Agency issued a commentary titled "Maintaining Social Stability is the Current Priority," pointing out that in recent days, the capital has seen some abnormal situations that warrant attention. "There are some people who, under the pretext of mourning Hu Yaobang, have deliberately directed their attacks at the Party and the government. They have delivered inflammatory speeches, shouted reactionary slogans like 'down with the Communist Party,' defaced the Monument to the People's Heroes, and even stormed Zhongnanhai, injuring police officers maintaining order. Their actions are clearly not about mourning Hu Yaobang but about disrupting the normal mourning activities. Their behavior has already exceeded the bounds of the law. It is entirely necessary to take decisive measures to stop such illegal activities immediately."

	The commentary emphasized, "All patriotic citizens must maintain a stable and united political situation, which is the current priority. However, there are indeed a few people, either openly or covertly, inciting trouble. They do not genuinely care about the country's strength or the people's happiness; instead, they are eager for chaos. All those who are passionate and kind-hearted, and all those who genuinely support reform and opening up and hope for the country's prosperity, must stay calm, discern right from wrong, be vigilant against these people, and never fall for their tricks."

	Xinhua's commentary concluded: "In the process of reform and opening up, maintaining a stable and united political situation and achieving new results in rectification and adjustment is the best way to commemorate Hu Yaobang."

   《维护社会稳定是当前大局》
    本报讯  新华社４月２０日播发题为《维护社会稳定是当前大局》的评论，指出首都这几天出现了一些值得注意的不正常情况。“有那么一些人，借口悼念胡耀邦同志，蓄意把矛头指向党和政府。他们发表煽动性讲演，呼喊打倒共产党的反动口号，污损人民英雄纪念碑，甚至冲击新华门，打伤维持秩序的武警战士。他们明明白白地不是在悼念胡耀邦同志，而是在干扰正常的悼念活动。他们的行动已经越出了法律允许的范围。对这样的违法活动，采取坚决措施及时加以制止是完全必要的。”
    评论强调，“一切爱国的公民都要维护安定团结的政治局面，这是当前的大局。但是，现在确有极少数人在幕前或幕后煽动闹事。他们并不是真正关心国家的富强、人民的幸福，而是唯恐天下不乱。一切热情而善良的人，一切真心支持改革开放、希望祖国繁荣富强的人，都要冷静思考，明辨是非，提高对这些人的警惕，千万不要上了他们的当。”
    新华社评论最后写道：“在改革开放中维护安定团结的政治局面，创造治理整顿的新成绩，就是对胡耀邦同志的最好纪念。”
