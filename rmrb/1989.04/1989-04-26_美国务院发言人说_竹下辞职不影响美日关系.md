	The U.S. State Department spokesperson, Richard Boucher, said today that the resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru will not affect U.S.-Japan relations.

	Boucher said, "The United States' relationship with the Japanese government remains unchanged. Japan is an ally of the United States."

	Takeshita Noboru was forced to announce his resignation as Prime Minister late on the 24th due to the heavy pressure from the Recruit scandal. Boucher said that Secretary of State James Baker was "very sorry" that things had developed to this point.

	However, the spokesperson said that the change in the Japanese government would have some impact on the ongoing negotiations for the joint production of the F-16X fighter jet.

	The U.S. government is currently demanding to revise the agreement signed during the Reagan administration for the joint production of the F-16X fighter jet with Japan, to ensure that Japan's civilian aviation industry does not utilize U.S. high technology and that the U.S. can share new technology with Japan.

　　美国务院发言人说    
    竹下辞职不影响美日关系
    新华社华盛顿４月２５日电  美国国务院发言人塔特怀勒今天表示，日本首相竹下登的辞职不会影响美日之间的关系。
    塔特怀勒说，“美国同日本政府的关系保持不变。日本是美国的盟国。”
    竹下登在利库路特案的重重压力下被迫于２４日晚宣布将辞去首相职务。塔特怀勒说，贝克国务卿对“事情发展到如此地步感到非常遗憾”。
    但是这位发言人表示，日本政府的更替会对目前正在进行美日合作生产ＦＳＸ战斗机的谈判“有所影响”。
    美国政府目前要求重新修订里根政府时期同日本签订的合作生产ＦＳＸ战斗机的协议，以确保美国的高技术不被日本的民航工业所利用以及美国能同日本分享新技术。
