The Chengdu Railway Central Hospital, located near the train station, has a particularly busy obstetrics and gynecology department. Women coming for abortions, induced labor, and out-of-wedlock births make the department seem especially hectic and tense.

Of course, there are also cases of unplanned births and births from out-of-province women without certificates. The hospital's obstetrics and gynecology staff have a hard time dealing with these situations: once a woman with a pregnant belly comes in, what can they do but let her give birth?

A pregnant woman from Zigong City timed it perfectly, arriving in Chengdu just as her labor pains started. The train conductor, noticing her discomfort, gave her special attention. Upon arriving in Chengdu, the conductor immediately called the hospital to send a car. The medical staff, of course, welcomed her with smiles. However, the woman had no money, so the hospital had to cover the medical and nutritional expenses and even arrange for her return ticket. When she left with her baby, she left her name and address, but when the hospital contacted her hometown, they replied, "No such person exists." Similar incidents have occurred several times in the past two years at this hospital.

Abandonment of newborns also happens occasionally. Women from out of town who give birth without certificates often want boys. If they give birth to a girl, or if the baby is sick, the mother will leave the baby and slip away, leaving the hospital with the "burden."

According to the hospital, a couple of years ago, when the hospital had less experience, there were many out-of-province women coming to give birth without certificates. At its peak, there were more than 10 such cases per month, putting a lot of pressure on the hospital. After learning from these experiences, the hospital implemented a rule: women giving birth without certificates must pay a fine of 200 yuan in addition to medical expenses. If they can provide a birth permit later, the fine will be refunded. Since implementing this measure, the situation has improved, but there are still occasional cases of women giving birth without certificates.

The reporter looked through the fine records at the hospital's obstetrics and gynecology department. From January to March this year, there were 14 cases, with only 4 of them providing certificates and getting refunds.

A doctor told the reporter that birth permits come in all forms, some genuine and some fake. Some women obviously use borrowed or photocopied birth permits, and there are many loopholes in this area.

How to effectively stop unplanned births? From the perspective of Chengdu Railway Central Hospital's troubles, the key is for each locality and unit to educate and manage childbearing couples properly. "When the melon is ripe, it falls off the vine." Once the melon is ripe, it will inevitably fall. Only by taking early measures can one be proactive.

　　产院的烦恼
　　——访成都铁路中心医院
    本报记者　罗茂城
    成都铁路中心医院，地处火车站附近，该院的妇产科，显得格外繁忙，前来刮宫的、引产的、婚外生育的，颇有点应接不暇，显出一种特殊的紧张。
    自然，这中间也有计划外生育者、外省来的无证生育者。对此，医院妇产科的同志有苦难言：既然人家腆着肚子进来了，不让生又能怎么办呢？
    一位来自自贡市的孕妇，她算好时间，在将生未生时挤上到成都的火车。列车员发现她肚子痛，还给以重点照顾。车到成都，立即打电话叫医院派车来接，医护人员自然得笑脸相迎。谁知产妇身无分文，医院不仅得贴上医药费、营养费，还得筹措其返程车票。产妇抱着婴儿走时虽然留下了姓名、地址，可医院去函联系，当地却回答“查无此人”。类似这种情况，这所医院近两年发生过好几起。
    产妇弃婴事件也时有发生。外地来的无证生育的妇女，大多想要男孩，若生的是女孩，或者婴儿有病，产妇便扔下婴儿悄然而去，把“包袱”甩给了医院。
    据医院介绍，前两年医院没经验，外地外省前来医院无证生育的产妇特别多，高峰时一个月达１０多个，给医院造成很大的压力。后来吸取教训，医院规定，凡无证生育者，除收取医药费外，需先罚款２００元；若事后能补交准生证者，罚款如数退还。采取这一措施以来，情况大有好转，但无证生育者仍时有发生。
    记者在该院妇产科翻阅了一下罚款单，今年１—３月，就有１４个，其中补证退款的仅４个。
    一位医生告诉记者，准生证也五花八门，有真有假。有的产妇显然是借来的或复印的准生证，这方面漏洞不少。
    如何有效制止计划外生育？从成都铁路中心医院的烦恼来看，关键是各地、各单位要教育和管理好育龄夫妇。“瓜熟蒂落”，一旦瓜已熟了，总是要落下来的。只有及早采取措施，方为上策。
