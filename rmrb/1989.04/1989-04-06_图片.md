Recently, the Lebanese government army and Druze Muslim militias engaged in fierce armed clashes. The eastern and western districts of Beirut were shrouded in artillery fire, which spread to the Beirut port, the international airport, and the eastern city of Shatoura. Large numbers of Beirut residents fled to southern Lebanon. The image shows thousands of refugees in Bayada, Lebanon, following the guidance of a soldier as they head towards the southern region. In southern Lebanon, there are already 25,000 refugees from Beirut.
