The Coordination Bureau of the Non-Aligned Movement unanimously agreed to admit Venezuela as a formal member state and recommended that the September summit of the Non-Aligned Movement approve this decision. This decision was passed at a meeting held yesterday at the United Nations headquarters.

Venezuela currently participates in the Non-Aligned Movement as an observer. In 1982, it applied for formal membership, but due to a territorial dispute between Guyana and Venezuela over the Essequibo region, Guyana had reservations about Venezuela's application. Venezuela had to withdraw its application.

After Venezuela joins the Non-Aligned Movement, the number of formal member states in the organization will reach 102, with 18 in Latin America and the Caribbean region.

　　不结盟运动协调局同意    
    接纳委内瑞拉为成员国
    本报加拉加斯四月二十八日电  记者朱满庭报道：不结盟运动协调局一致同意接纳委内瑞拉为不结盟运动正式成员国，并建议九月份的不结盟首脑会议予以批准，这一决定是协调局昨天在联合国总部举行的会议上通过的。
    委内瑞拉目前以观察员身份参加不结盟运动。一九八二年曾提出正式加入不结盟的申请，但由于圭亚那与委内瑞拉在埃塞奎博地区有领土争端，圭亚那对委内瑞拉的申请有保留。委内瑞拉不得不撤回其申请。
    委内瑞拉加入不结盟运动后，该组织的正式成员国将达到一百零二个，其中拉美和加勒比地区为十八个。
