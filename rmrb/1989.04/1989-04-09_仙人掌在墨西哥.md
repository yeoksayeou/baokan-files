Mexico truly deserves the title of the "Cactus Country." Out of the more than 1,000 known cactus species in the world, it possesses more than half.

Cacti have strong practical value in Mexico. Whether in supermarkets, mobile stalls, or various vegetable and fruit supply centers, cacti leaves and fruits can be found for sale everywhere. Tests have shown that cacti contain abundant amounts of vitamin B, vitamin C, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, sulfate, and oxalate, all of which are essential nutrients for the human body. Mexicans peel and remove the spines from the tender cactus leaves to make a refreshing salad, which is crisp and delicious. The fruits of the cactus, once peeled, are juicy and sweet, invigorating the mind and body. Beverages, candied fruits, and other products made from cacti are excellent for cooling down in the summer. Additionally, cacti can be used to make alcohol, sugar, or as animal feed.

Cacti are also a great help to farmers. Mexico is a mountainous highland country with little rainfall and high temperatures, with arid regions accounting for about half of the national land area. However, cacti have long and numerous roots and thick leaves that can absorb large amounts of water during the rainy season. Mexican farmers utilize the growth habits of cacti by planting them along the edges of fields, which helps to retain water and moisture. They not only prevent soil erosion but also promote soil loosening and fertility through their root fungi.

Moreover, local residents use some special methods to utilize cacti for water storage, solving the problem of water scarcity during the dry season. It is estimated that one kilogram of fresh cactus can release enough water for one person to use in a day, and the water is pure and uncontaminated.

Since a type of alkaloid extracted from cacti was found to have the effect of inhibiting cancer cells, the medicinal value of cacti has been increasingly recognized. It is particularly effective in treating digestive system diseases.

People admire various flowers for their diverse shapes and vibrant colors. However, Mexicans particularly love cacti because of their tenacious nature and strong life force, silently contributing to people's lives.

　　仙人掌在墨西哥
    张旭平
    墨西哥不愧为“仙人掌之国”，在目前全世界已知的１０００多个仙人掌品种中，它拥有一半以上。
    仙人掌在墨西哥有很强的实用价值。不论是超级市场、流动网点或其他形形色色的蔬菜、水果供应中心，到处可以看到出售仙人掌的嫩叶片和果实。据测定，仙人掌内含有丰富的维生素Ｂ、维生素Ｃ、钾盐、钙、磷、硫酸盐、草酸盐等，这都是人体内不可缺少的营养。墨西哥人将仙人掌的嫩叶片刮皮去刺后拌凉菜吃，清脆可口。仙人掌的果实剥皮后食之，汁多味美，沁人心脾。用仙人掌制成的汽水、蜜饯等更是消暑佳品。此外，仙人掌还可酿酒、制糖或用作饲料。
    仙人掌还是农民的好帮手呢。墨西哥是个多山的高原之国，雨量少，气温高，干旱地区占全国土地面积的一半左右。然而仙人掌的根须又长又多；叶片肥厚，在雨季能大量吸收水份。墨西哥农民利用仙人掌的这种生长习性，把它扦插在田埂上，起到了蓄水保墒作用。它不仅可以防止水土流失，它的根菌还能促使土地松软、土质变肥。
    此外，当地居民还采用一些特殊的方式利用仙人掌蓄水，以解决旱季饮水难的问题。据测算，一公斤新鲜仙人掌一天蒸发出的水足可供一人食用，且水质纯净，不受污染。
    自从仙人掌中提取的一种生物碱被证明具有抑制癌细胞作用以来，仙人掌药用价值越来越被人们重视。它对消化系统疾病疗效特别显著。
    人们喜爱各类鲜花千姿百态，争芳斗艳。然而墨西哥人却偏爱仙人掌，因为它性格坚韧，生命顽强，为人们默默地贡献着自身。
