Title: "Coal Speculation" and "Bad Luck"

It is reported that the price of coal in Shanxi is only 30 to 40 yuan per ton, but when it is "speculated" to Zhejiang, the price increases by more than five times, reaching around 200 yuan per ton. Today, in Qinhuangdao Port, there are more than 140 companies involved in coal trading (see page 3 of this newspaper on March 29).

Those who speculate in coal are doing brisk business across the country, and their wealth is abundant. But who is having "bad luck"? Coal shortages affect several major power grids, leading to insufficient power supply for many factories; buying expensive coal increases production costs, which will inevitably affect prices and be passed on to consumers; original coal production enterprises are severely losing money, along with other energy shortages, dragging down the development of the national economy... In the end, it is the state, the people, and the entire construction cause that are having "bad luck."

To put it strongly, the "coal speculators" are lining their pockets by stripping the sweat and blood of coal miners!

Last summer, a natural scientist with outstanding contributions told me that when he returned to his hometown, he found that the coal mines there were not doing well, and workers were reluctant to work underground: one reason is that the ratio of surface personnel to underground workers has reached 1:1; another reason is that the meal provided to underground workers has been reduced from a relatively good portion to dry steamed buns.

This latter point is certainly also related to issues like catering services, but I think the main reason is that the entire industry of state-allocated mines is in deficit. Even if the grassroots leaders care about the people's livelihood, they are also helpless in the face of "no rice to cook"!

Unless the "coal speculators" are eliminated and the "intermediate links" are rectified, even if the state appropriately raises coal prices, the real benefits may not fall into the hands of coal production enterprises, and the income and welfare of coal miners will not improve much.

On the same day's newspaper, some deputies to the National People's Congress discussed that China's current way out lies in mobilizing the enthusiasm of hundreds of millions of people. Taking coal production as an example, millions of miners and grassroots cadres, under quite harsh conditions, guard their posts and produce raw coal for the country. This spirit and achievement move everyone whose conscience has not been extinguished and make those who only talk about mobilizing others' enthusiasm feel ashamed. If the "coal speculators" are eliminated, so that the miners' labor results directly contribute to the modernization cause and are not used as a means for "coal speculators" to profit, and if appropriate economic policies are implemented to ensure that the broad masses of miners, especially underground workers, reasonably increase their income, their enthusiasm will be further unleashed.

"Why, knowing there are so many 'coal speculators,' are they not decisively eliminated? Why, with so many 'coal speculators' rampant, are they not eliminated?" Many deputies to the National People's Congress asked. The rectification of the circulation sector is an important part of the current efforts to improve the economic environment and rectify the economic order. As reported above, the deputies pointed out that the "external speculation" of Shanxi coal, whether in Zhejiang or Qinhuangdao, is not a "foreign land"; in the very vicinity, there are such rampant "coal speculators" existing, is this not a challenge to the government's authority?

I have not conducted research on whether these "coal speculators" are "official speculators" or "private speculators," but I believe that the government and the people know the answer. Such corrupt phenomena spreading in the economic and even political domains not only make the state have "bad luck," make honest and law-abiding laborers have "bad luck," but also make the ruling party and the government have "bad luck," because it greatly weakens and damages the authority and credibility that the party and the government should have. If "official speculators" and other corrupt practices are allowed to run rampant, then there will be no authority for the party and the government. Therefore, the broad masses of the people firmly support the Party Central Committee and the State Council in strengthening authority, improving the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and through the effectiveness of rectification, promoting reform and construction, and establishing a true leadership authority.

### “倒煤”与“倒霉”

　　“倒煤”与“倒霉”
　　唐棠
    据透露，如今山西煤在当地吨价只有三四十元，而“倒”到浙江，吨价就提高五倍以上，达２００元左右。在今日的秦皇岛港，插手煤炭经营的公司就有１４０多个（见本报３月２９日三版）。
    “倒煤”的，生意兴隆通四海，财源茂盛达三江，那么谁“倒霉”呢？煤炭短缺，影响几大电网供电，许多工厂因缺电开工不足；买高价煤，增加了生产成本，势必影响价格，又转嫁到用户身上；原煤生产企业严重亏损，同其他能源不足的问题一起拖着国民经济发展的后腿……归根结蒂，“倒霉”的还是国家、人民和整个建设事业。
    说得重些，“煤倒”们中饱私囊的剥皮，剥掉的正是煤矿工人的血汗！
    去年夏天一位有突出贡献的自然科学家告诉我，他回乡探亲，发现那里的煤矿生产很不景气，工人不愿下井作业：一是井上人员比例过高，与井下工人已经达到１比１；一是对井下工人供应的一餐，已经从原来质量较好的份饭降为干馒头了。
    这后一点，固然也有炊事服务一类问题，但我想主要的原因是统配矿全行业亏损，基层领导再关心群众生活，也难为“无米之炊”呀！
    “煤倒”不除，“中间环节”不加整顿，即使国家适当上调煤炭价格，真正的实惠也未必落到煤炭生产企业手中，煤矿工人的收入和福利还是不能得到多少改善。
    在同一天报上，一些人大代表在讨论中，都谈到中国当前的“出路就在于调动起亿万人的积极性”。拿煤炭生产来说，千百万矿工和基层干部在相当艰苦的条件下，坚守岗位，为国家生产原煤，这种精神和实绩使一切良心未泯者感动，使一切空谈“调动”别人的积极性者惭愧。如果取缔了“煤倒”，使矿工的劳动成果直接贡献于现代化的事业，而不成为“煤倒”渔利的筹码，再加上适当的经济政策措施，使广大矿工特别是井下工理所当然地提高收入，他们的积极性必将更大地发挥出来。
    “明知有那么多‘煤倒’，为何不坚决取缔？有那么多‘煤倒’盛行于世为何取缔不了？”许多人大代表提出质询。对流通领域的整顿，是当前治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序的重要一环。如上面所报道，代表们指出的晋煤“外倒”，浙江也好，秦皇岛也好，都非“化外之地”；在肘腋之间，竟有这样猖狂的“煤倒”存在，这不是对政府权威的挑战吗？
    这些“煤倒”是“官倒”还是“私倒”，我没有调查研究，但我相信政府和老百姓心中是有数的。诸如此类的腐败现象在经济领域以至政治领域蔓延肆虐，不仅使国家“倒霉”，使正直守法的劳动者“倒霉”，也使执政党和政府“倒霉”，因为它极大地削弱和损害了党和政府应有的权威和信誉。如果一任“官倒”等腐败盛行，则断无党和政府的权威可言。因此，广大人民群众是坚决支持党中央和国务院加强权威，治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序，并通过整治的实效，推进改革和建设，来树立真正的领导权威的。
