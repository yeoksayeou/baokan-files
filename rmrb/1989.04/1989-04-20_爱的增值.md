The love between parents and children is a universal emotion, and the love passed down through generations is always greater than the generation gap. One common sentiment is that parents always want to leave something for their children. From ancient times to the present, whether it is a prestigious throne, vast wealth, or a lock of hair, a few coins, all bear the glow of love. Due to changes in ethics, the complexity of emotions, and the evolution of laws, countless touching stories have been passed down in this river of love. The American television series "Our Family" depicts such harmonious love. In three generations, the youngest 9-year-old girl Molly sells lemonade to buy birthday gifts for her family, and the 12-year-old boy David paints house numbers to earn pocket money so he doesn't have to ask his mother for it. This makes me think of a question I have been pondering for a long time: Can love appreciate? Is "passed-down love" contradictory to "self-reliance"?

Respecting the elderly and caring for the young is a traditional virtue of the Chinese nation, and stories of four or even five generations living together in harmony are often praised. While affirming and promoting this, we should pay attention to a phenomenon: from an economic perspective, in this "passed-down love," the property of many families has not been properly appreciated but has been consumed too much and too early. The main reason is that some parents overindulge their children, and children overly depend on their parents. For example, some young people have already started working (including college graduates) and still receive "subsidies" from their parents, and they compare with each other, taking pride in receiving more. Again, when young people get married, according to a survey in a southern city, the general cost is between 3,000 to 7,000 yuan, with over 50% paid by parents; according to a survey in a northern city, the average cost of young people getting married is 9,035 yuan, with the highest reaching 31,000 yuan, of which 51.5% comes from parents' "sponsorship"; even after getting married, many people still eat and live with their parents... Of course, this subsidy or sponsorship, whether given or taken, is a manifestation of love. However, this is different from inheriting property after parents pass away; it is an "early consumption" of parents' property. The drawback of this "time difference" is that it weakens the children's spirit of self-struggle, making the parents' love unable to appreciate. Here, let's do a hypothetical calculation: a couple of parents originally could leave 100 units of property to their children, but due to giving it to their children too early and too much (excluding normal upbringing costs), they can only leave 60 units; after the children grow up, if they struggle on their own, they could originally accumulate 80 units of property before their parents pass away, but due to their strong dependence and lack of initiative, they only have 40 units at that time; thus, the children ultimately get 100 units of inherited property plus their own property, reducing from the original 180 units to 100 units. More importantly, the children did not get the training of self-struggle, and society also lost 80 units of property that could have been regenerated. If this continues from generation to generation, how much wealth does the entire society lose? This is not a mere imaginary and meaningless number.

Calculating the economic account does not exclude love, because money represents love, but love is not all about money. Parents raising their children to adulthood is love, cultivating children's self-reliance is a deeper love; children's self-reliance is a return of love to their parents, and it is also a high sense of responsibility to the family and society, and a manifestation of self-respect, self-confidence, and honor. In terms of individual self-reliance, we also have many admirable examples, but overall, we should admit that we are not as good as some economically developed countries. For example, former US President Reagan had four children, who, after growing up, found jobs like everyone else and were completely independent economically; Reagan's eldest son, Michael, even lined up to receive relief money when he was unemployed. The late President Tito's son, Misha, left home at 19 to struggle on his own, becoming a manager of an oil company from an ordinary worker. Great figures are like this, and ordinary people should be no different. We should not just sneer at the phenomenon in some Western countries where parents and children pay for their own meals at the same table, but should consider if there is anything worth learning. After all, they also have "passed-down love," and parents will not take their property to God after they pass away.

Although the national conditions and systems are different, as a person living in the world, we should have love and a spirit of self-reliance, which should be the same. This love should be able to appreciate, strengthen the spirit of self-reliance, and this spirit of self-reliance should increase love. "Can love appreciate? Parents of today should think; young people should not be angry, for you will also have old age; self-reliance and mutual love, passing down a prosperous era."

### 爱的增值

　　爱的增值
    朱焘
    舐犊之情人皆有之，“代爱”总是高于“代沟”。常情之一，就是父母总想给子女留下点什么。古往今来，大到显赫王位、万贯家产，小至头上一缕青丝，手中几枚铜钱，无不闪耀着爱的光环。由于伦理变异、情感交杂、法规更迭，在这爱的长河里，流传着无数无尽的动人故事。美国电视系列剧《我们的家》，表现了如许和谐相爱。三代中，最小的９岁女孩莫莉为了给家人买生日礼品而去卖柠檬水，１２岁的男孩大卫为了少向母亲要零花钱而去给别人油刷门牌号码，使我想起思索已久的一个问题：爱能否增值，“代爱”与“自立”是矛盾的吗？
    尊老扶幼是中华民族的传统美德，四世乃至五世同堂的互爱常传为佳话。在肯定并弘扬这一点的同时，应注意这样一种现象：从经济的角度看，在这种“代爱”的承继中，我们许多家庭的财产没有得到应有的增值，而过多过早地消耗掉了。其因主要是一些父母对子女的溺爱和子女对父母的过分依赖。比如有些青年已经走上工作岗位（包括大学毕业生），自己有了工资收入，还要从父母那里领取“补贴”，并互相攀比，以多为荣。又如青年人结婚，据南方某市调查，一般花费在３０００元到七八千元，有５０％以上须由父母掏腰包；另据北方某市调查，青年结婚平均费用为９０３５元，最高达３．１万元，其中５１．５％来自父母的“赞助”；即使结了婚，许多人仍然在父母身边吃饭、住房……当然，这种补贴或赞助无论是给予的还是索取的，都是爱的一种表现。但是，这不同于父母辞世后遗产的继承，它是父母财产的“早耗”，这种“时间差”的弊端在于削弱了子女的自我奋斗精神，使父母之爱不能增值。这里不妨算一笔假设的账：某对父母本来可留给子女的遗产为１００，因过早、过多地转给子女消耗（正常的抚育费等除外），最终只能留下６０；子女成人后，如果独自奋斗，本来在父母辞世前可积蓄财产为８０，因依赖性强，懒于进取，彼时财产只为４０；这样子女最终得到的遗产加上自己的财产，就从本应有的１８０而减为１００了。更重要的是，子女没得到自我奋斗的锻炼，社会上还减少了８０分财产再生新值的机会。如此代代相传，整个社会减少多少财富，并不是一个虚幻和没有意义的数字。
    算经济账并不排斥爱，因为钱表现了爱，但爱并不是都表现在钱上。父母养育子女成人是爱，培养子女自立是更深的爱；子女自立是对父母之爱的回报，更是对家庭、对社会有高度责任感，对自己具有自尊、自信和荣誉感的表现。在个人自立方面，我们虽也有许多可歌可敬的事例，在整体上应承认还不如一些经济发达国家。比如美国前总统里根有４个子女，成年后不但像其他人一样自己找职业，而且经济上完全独立，长子迈克尔失业时还排队领过救济金；已故铁托总统的儿子米沙１９岁离家自己奋斗，从普通工人成为一家石油公司负责人。大人物如此，小人物当更无特殊。我们对西方一些国家父子同桌吃饭各自付费的现象不应只是嗤之以鼻，而应思之有无可取之处。须知他们也是有“代爱”的，父母辞世后也不会把财产带到上帝那里去的。
    尽管国情不同，制度有异，但我们作为一个人生活在世界上应当有爱、有自立精神则应是相同的。这种爱要能增值，要能加强自立精神，而这种自立精神要能增加爱。“爱能增值否，当今父母思；青年勿恼怒，君亦有老时；自立复互爱，代代传盛世”。
