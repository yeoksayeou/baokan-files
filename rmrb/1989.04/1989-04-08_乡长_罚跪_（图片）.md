    The Township Head "Makes Them Kneel"
    — Why are they all kneeling?
    — The township head took the benches for a family celebration.

    This incident occurred in a small village in the province of Henan. The township head, in preparation for a family celebration, ordered the village school to provide benches. The school, lacking sufficient benches, had to borrow some from the students' homes. Consequently, during class, the students had no choice but to kneel on the ground to study.

    The situation came to light when a reporter visited the village. The reporter found the students kneeling on the ground, their textbooks open in front of them. The students explained that the benches had been taken by the township head for his family's celebration.

    The reporter then visited the township head's home and saw the benches neatly arranged for the celebration. The township head admitted to taking the benches but justified his actions by saying that the celebration was important and that the students could study just as well while kneeling.

    This incident sparked widespread outrage among the villagers. They criticized the township head for his disregard for the students' education and well-being. The local education authorities were also criticized for their failure to intervene and protect the students' rights.

    In response to the public outcry, the township head was eventually removed from his position, and the benches were returned to the school. The incident served as a reminder of the importance of upholding educational standards and the rights of students.
