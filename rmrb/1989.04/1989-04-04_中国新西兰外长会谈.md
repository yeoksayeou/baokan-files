China and New Zealand Foreign Ministers Hold Talks

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 3, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen held talks today with New Zealand Minister of Foreign Affairs Russell Marshall on major international issues and Sino-New Zealand bilateral relations and reached broad consensus.

	In discussing the Cambodian issue, Qian Qichen pointed out that the key to a political solution to the Cambodian problem is the genuine and complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops. Regarding Vietnam, he said, "We should listen to what they say and observe what they do." Qian Qichen said that China will further consolidate and strengthen the existing friendly cooperative relations with ASEAN countries. China supports the efforts of the South Pacific countries to maintain regional peace and stability, supports these countries' advocacy for strengthening regional cooperation, and advocates strengthening economic and technological cooperation and exchanges among Asia-Pacific countries.

	After the two-and-a-half-hour talks, Qian Qichen hosted a luncheon for Marshall. Both sides expressed satisfaction with the development of friendly cooperative relations between the two countries over the 17 years since the establishment of diplomatic ties and believed that there is still great potential for further development.

	Marshall pointed out that New Zealand's relations with China are "sincere and mature." In discussing the Cambodian issue, he stressed that Vietnam must withdraw its troops. He believed that establishing a four-party provisional coalition government led by Prince Sihanouk is the most feasible way to resolve the Cambodian issue and restore peace to this war-torn country.

　　中国新西兰外长会谈
    据新华社北京４月３日电  外交部长钱其琛今天上午在此间同新西兰外交部长拉塞尔·马歇尔就当前重大国际问题和中新双边关系举行会谈，并取得了广泛的一致。
    在谈到柬埔寨问题时，钱其琛指出，政治解决柬埔寨问题的关键是越南真正全部撤军。对越南要听其言，观其行。钱其琛说，中国要进一步巩固并加强同东盟国家之间业已存在的友好合作关系。中国支持南太平洋各国为维护区域和平与稳定的努力，支持这些国家加强区域合作的主张，并主张加强亚太各国的经济技术合作与交流。
    两个半小时的会谈结束后，钱其琛为马歇尔举行了午宴。双方在祝酒时对两国建交１７年来友好合作关系不断发展表示满意，并认为这种关系还有很大的发展潜力。
    马歇尔指出，新西兰同中国的关系是“真诚的、成熟的。”他在谈到柬埔寨问题时强调，越南必须撤军。他认为，建立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府是解决柬埔寨问题、在这个饱经战乱的国家恢复和平的最可行办法。
