	Short Pieces Four

	Opening Speech
	The opening speech by former U.S. President Reagan at the Olympics consisted of only 16 English words. Translated into Chinese, it is: “I declare the opening of the 23rd modern Olympic Games in Los Angeles!”

	Juvenile Fiction
	The American newspaper *Christian Science Monitor* once organized a contest titled “Fairy Tales for Adults.” The first-place winner was “A Burning Cigarette,” which consisted of only 34 characters: “A cigarette emitting wispy smoke pointed to itself and said, ‘I am the best visual aid to show that smoking shortens life.’” The newspaper’s comment was: The use of personification in writing is a model for fairy tales, and the promotion of quitting smoking is vivid and profound.

	Letter
	In 1963, during the renovation of the City Hospital in Chengguan, Zoucheng County, Shandong Province, a letter was sent to Comrade Guo Moruo requesting him to write the hospital’s name. Soon after, a reply from Guo Moruo was received. Upon opening it, the envelope was found to be empty. The hospital’s name had been written on the envelope. This letter, without any content, is the shortest letter in the world.

	Novel
	During the Jin Dynasty, Tao Yuanming wrote a short story titled “The Fallen Thief,” which consisted of only 25 characters: “Cai Yi was very brave, his voice like thunder. Once, two thieves entered his room, and Yi slapped the bed and shouted, causing both thieves to fall to the ground.” Although the text is short, it includes characters, events, and the plot is quite interesting.

　　短文四则
    开幕词美国前总统里根在奥运会上的致词，仅用了１６个英文单词，译成中文是：“我宣布进入现代化的第二十三届奥运会，在洛杉矶正式开幕！”
    童话　美国《基督教科学箴言报》曾组织过一次题为《写给成年人看的童话》的征文，获得第一名的是《一支燃着的烟》，全文仅３４个字：“一支冒着袅袅青烟的香烟，指着自己说：‘我是最好的直观教具，说明抽烟会缩短生命。’”报社的评语是：用拟人手法写作，堪称童话，宣传戒烟，生动、深刻。
    书信　１９６３年，山东省诸城县城关医院改建时，给郭沫若同志去信，请他题写院名。不久，接到了郭老的回信。拆开一看，信封内竟空空如也。原来，院名已写在信封上。这封无字信，是世界上最短的信。
    小说　晋代的陶渊明写过一篇题为《陨盗》的文言小说，只有２５个字：“蔡裔有勇气，声若雷震。尝有二偷儿入室，裔拊床一呼，二盗俱陨。”文字虽短，却有人物、事件，情节也很有趣。　　　（３月１６日《文学报》顾盛杉文）
