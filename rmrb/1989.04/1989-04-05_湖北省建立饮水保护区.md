Hubei Province Establishes Drinking Water Protection Zones

    According to Xinhua News Agency in Wuhan on April 4, (Xinhua News Agency reporter Chen Xinzhou, China Environmental News reporter Li Yuanbo) Hubei Province has established drinking water protection zones in recent years. Twenty-five cities have effectively controlled drinking water pollution, and diseases caused by drinking contaminated water among residents have significantly decreased. Starting from 1987, Hubei Province established drinking water protection zones in cities such as Wuhan, Xiangfan, Ezhou, and Jingmen. Twenty cities have issued "Regulations for the Management of Drinking Water Source Protection Zones." Each city generally designates a one-kilometer upstream and one-hundred-meter downstream area from the water intake point as the drinking water protection zone, strictly prohibiting the direct discharge of sewage within the protection zone.

　　湖北省建立饮水保护区
    据新华社武汉四月四日电  （新华社记者陈新洲、中国环境报记者李远柏）湖北省近年来建立饮水保护区，已有二十五个城市有效地控制了饮水污染，居民因饮水不洁而造成的疾病已明显减少。从一九八七年开始，湖北省在武汉、襄樊、鄂州、荆门等城市建立饮水保护区，并有二十个城市颁发了《饮用水源保护区管理办法》。各城市一般以取水点为中心，划定其上游一千米至下游一百米水域为饮水保护区，保护区内严禁直接排放污水。
