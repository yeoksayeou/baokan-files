Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 19th — China will establish a large-scale information database known as the Fixed Asset Investment Project Management Information System. Initial results have been achieved through pilot projects in Shanghai and five other provinces and municipalities, and the system will be further promoted nationwide.

This system, which is part of the national key scientific and technological research projects for the Seventh Five-Year Plan, is led by the Shanghai Municipal Economic Information Center and co-designed with information centers in Dalian, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu. It is built with the investment planning departments as the main body and primarily collects investment project information through the planning management channels, establishing corresponding databases at the central, provincial, municipal, and county administrative levels.

After the completion and operation of the national Fixed Asset Investment Project Management Information System, it will be able to collect information on all investment projects above 300,000 yuan, including both budgetary and non-budgetary, central and local, public and collective, and domestic and foreign loan-funded projects, using a unified information standard. This will cover all information from the project initiation to completion, allowing relevant national departments to accurately grasp the total investment and its input-output structure, thereby effectively conducting macroeconomic management.

Additionally, the system can analyze dynamic information from different stages of the project, such as planning, construction, and investment. It can also improve decision-making levels and optimize investment benefits through comparative studies.

Although the system still needs further improvement, it has already shown its effectiveness. During the investment project cleanup in Shanghai, the entire city took less than a week to clean up over 13,000 investment projects and approximately 600,000 data points, timely clarifying the current situation of Shanghai's investment activities. This has received unanimous praise from various sectors in China.

　　为国家宏观管理提供依据
　　我将建固定资产投资信息系统
　　汇集各类３０万元以上基建技改项目全部信息
    新华社上海４月１９日电　（记者余曦、通讯员许沛）我国将建立一个大型信息库——固定资产投资项目管理信息系统。通过在上海等６省３市试点，已取得初步成效，将进一步在全国范围推广实施。
    这项被列入国家七五重点科技攻关项目的系统，由上海市经济信息中心牵头，会同大连、浙江、江苏的信息中心联合设计。它以投资计划部门为建设主体，主要通过计划管理渠道采集投资项目信息，在中央、省、地、县４级行政层次建立相应的数据库。
    国家固定资产投资项目管理信息系统建成投入运行后，将能对全社会预算内和预算外、中央和地方安排、全民和集体等不同所有制投资主体、国内外贷款和自筹集资等不同资金渠道等各类投资３０万元以上的基建和技改项目，以统一的信息标准，汇集从立项到竣工的所有信息，使国家有关部门较为准确地掌握投资的总量及其投入产出结构，从而有效地进行宏观管理。
    同时，这一系统能分析分别来自项目筹划、在建、投资等阶段的动态信息。还可通过比较研究，提高决策水平，优化投资效益。
    这一信息系统目前虽还有待进一步完善，但已显示效益。在上海投资项目清理过程中，全市仅用了不到一周的时间，即清理投资项目１．３万多个，约６００万个数据，及时清理了上海投资活动现状，受到国内各界的一致好评。
