The Socialist Party has won 21 cities in the provinces, Chirac has triumphed in Paris, and the three reformist candidates from the Socialist Party, Communist Party, and the Rally for the Republic have all won their seats… This is the scene from the recently concluded French municipal elections. After the European Parliament elections in June, France's political landscape will enter a relatively calm period. Through this year-long whirlwind of elections, one can see a new trend emerging: renewal and openness.

Due to the economic prosperity of the post-war decades and the emergence of a broad middle class, France has seen two new phenomena in its politics and society: a weakening of religious influence and a fading of ideological fervor. Before the 1960s and 1970s, bosses and Catholics were sure to support the right, low-income workers and youth were mostly left-leaning, and workers definitely supported the Communist Party. Now, this political pattern is becoming history. In the 1980s, French voters' actual criteria for choosing candidates often had little to do with political labels or past performance. Their main judgment criteria were the candidate's abilities and the resulting trust. A French friend explained that the French chose Mitterrand as president, not for any other reason, but simply because he could handle the job of president. This was even more evident in the recent municipal elections: despite his advanced age, the Communist Party member Duromea was re-elected as the mayor of Le Havre, while the new mayor of Strasbourg, Socialist Party member Rothman, is an outstanding middle-aged woman. In Lyon, despite his past achievements, Colomb was defeated.

In France, where religious faith is weakening and ideology is fading, candidates' attitudes towards traditional social norms remain an important factor for voters in making their choices. For example, in last year's general election, the extreme right-wing National Front, which was once prominent, ultimately failed to find allies in the right-wing camp because its proposals were incompatible with deeply ingrained values such as liberty, equality, and fraternity.

The most fashionable word in French politics today is "openness," meaning that major parties all claim not to monopolize power but to absorb like-minded individuals from other parties into the cabinet. After Mitterrand's re-election as president, he did not choose a prime minister from the "core" of the Socialist Party but appointed Rogard, who had previously had significant disagreements with him, setting a precedent for appointing the right person for the job. Subsequently, Rogard, in forming his cabinet, also included several "open ministers" from non-ruling parties. Similar phenomena exist in the opposition. In this year's municipal elections, the Rally for the Republic suffered losses in the provinces, but its newly elected mayors in Lyon, Grenoble, and Epinal, Noal, Gallinon, and Seguin, respectively, won the trust of the residents with their innovative style of emphasizing the common interests of all parties, not being bound by factions, and not speaking in party jargon. Additionally, the "open ministers" who participated in the election were all successful. This clearly reflects the direction of French public opinion in the 1980s.

French television broadcasts live coverage of each election. On March 12, a reporter from Channel 1, while reporting on the live situation of the Marseille municipal election, opened by saying: "The reporter is reporting from 'New York'..." As soon as the words were spoken, the program host immediately explained that the reporter's "New York" referred to the "New York Café" in Marseille, not New York City in the United States. He then solemnly pointed out: "France's elections do not need to listen to New York's opinions." This small incident is thought-provoking. French political figures, from left to right, are most sensitive to being accused of having foreign backgrounds. In France, no matter how high a person's reputation, once they have a foreign power background, they are not only legally unacceptable but will also be immediately abandoned by public opinion and the masses. The deeply rooted idea that France's affairs should be handled by French people is the foundation of the French state and a principle unanimously followed by political figures.

With renewal and openness comes a change in the style of political figures. Leaders from various factions, during their campaigns, strive to get closer to the people. Former Prime Minister and current National Assembly Speaker Fabius, while campaigning for a seat in the assembly, once personally held a megaphone and called out to residents on the streets to engage in dialogue. This also reflects the widespread concern among French political figures: the high rate of voter abstention in each election and the low political enthusiasm of the masses are another aspect of French political life that cannot be ignored.

　　更新和开放
　　——法国政坛新风
　　吴子陵
    社会党在外省连克21城，希拉克在巴黎大获全胜，社会党、共产党、保卫共和联盟3党的3位革新派候选人无一落选……这就是刚刚结束的法国市镇选举的场景。待到6月欧洲议会选举之后，法国的政坛将出现一段相对平静的时期。透过这一年多令人眼花缭乱的选举周期，人们可见到一股新风正起于青萍之末，它有两个特点：一曰更新，二曰开放。
    由于战后几十年的经济繁荣以及广大中产阶层的出现，法国在政治和社会方面出现了两种新现象：一是宗教信仰的感召力减弱，二是意识形态淡化。60—70年代前，老板和天主教徒肯定赞成右派，收入低的职工和青年大都左倾，工人一定拥护共产党，如今，这种政治格式正在成为历史。80年代的法国选民的实际选择标准往往与政治标签、昔日政绩关系不大。他们主要的判断依据是候选人的能力，以及由此而产生的信任感。一位法国朋友解释说，法国人选举密特朗为总统，不为别的，只是由于他能胜任总统职务。在最近的市镇选举中更是如此：共产党人杜罗梅阿尽管年事已高仍连选连任勒哈佛尔市市长，斯特拉斯堡市新任市长社会党人托特曼则是一位杰出的中年妇女，而在里昂市的科伦布，虽以往政绩不错，却仍遭败北。
    在宗教信仰减弱、意识形态淡化的法国，候选人对传统社会准则的态度仍是选民决定取舍的重要因素，例如，在去年大选中嚣张一时的极右派国民阵线，终因它的主张与自由、平等、博爱这样一些深入人心的价值观水火不容，以致在右派阵营中也难于找到同盟。
    法国政坛上目前最时髦的字眼叫作“开放”，即各主要政党都声称不搞一党掌权，而要吸收别党中与自己志同道合者入阁。密特朗总统再次当选之后，并没有从社会党“嫡系”中选择总理，却任命了过去与自己歧见颇深的罗加尔组阁，开了量才用人的先河。随后罗加尔在组阁时，又吸收了好几位非执政党人的“开放部长”。反对党中也存在着类似的现象。今年市镇选举中，保卫共和联盟在外省失利，但它在里昂、格勒诺布尔和埃比纳尔三市新当选的市长诺阿尔、加利农和塞甘均以注重各界共同利益、不拘门户之见、不说派话的革新风格赢得了居民的信任。此外，参加竞选的“开放部长”无一落选。这明确地反映了80年代法国民心所向。
    法国电视台对各次选举均作直播报道。3月12日，电视1台记者报道马赛市镇选举实况时开口便说：“记者自‘纽约’报道……”，话音一落，节目主持人立即解释道：记者说的“纽约”是指马赛“纽约咖啡馆”，并不是美国的纽约市。他接着郑重指出：“法国的选举用不着听纽约的意见。”这个小插曲耐人寻味。法国政界人士从左到右最忌讳的是被人指控有外国背景。在法国，名望再高的人物，一旦有了外国势力背景，不仅为法律所不容，而且立即会被舆论界和群众抛弃。法国的事情由法国人办，这一根深蒂固的观念，正是法国的立国之本，也是政界人士一致遵守的信条。
    随着更新与开放而来的是政界人士作风的改变。各派政要在竞选中，力求接近群众。前总理、现任国民议会议长的法比尤斯在竞选议员时，曾亲自拿着扬声话筒，在街道呼唤居民来对话。这也反映了法国政界人士普遍的忧虑：历次选举中选民弃权率过高，民众政治热情低落，这是法国政治生活的另一个不可忽视的侧面。
