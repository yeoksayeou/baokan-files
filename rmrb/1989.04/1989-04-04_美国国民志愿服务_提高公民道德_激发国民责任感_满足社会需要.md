The United States is currently attempting to implement a national volunteer service program, reportedly to enhance citizens' morals, reignite the national sense of responsibility, and meet social needs.

Recently, South Carolina conducted a survey among high school students in the state regarding their life goals. From 1976 to 1986, the number of students who wanted to "make a lot of money" significantly increased, while the number of those seeking "meaning and purpose in life" sharply decreased. Concerned individuals, upon seeing these results, worried about the spiritual decay of American citizens, particularly the younger generation's obsession with material enjoyment. Some educators have even exclaimed, "This is the crisis we are facing."

Currently, the United States urgently needs guidance teachers, nursing staff, medical assistants, as well as workers for forests, farms, parks, and communities. However, many people consider these jobs to be low-paying and have little interest in them. Due to budget constraints, the government struggles to meet basic social needs such as childcare, elderly care, relief for the poor, homeless, and disabled. Enthusiastic individuals have considered solutions by recalling the early days of the nation's founding, when citizens united to contribute to public welfare, and the establishment of the Civilian Conservation Corps during Roosevelt's New Deal era, the largest national labor service organization in American history.

Over the past decade, several states in the United States have been experimenting with volunteer services. California established the Conservation Corps in 1976, with approximately 40,000 young people participating. They have worked diligently in extinguishing forest fires, rescuing flood victims, eradicating Mediterranean fruit flies, assisting local communities in building parks, cleaning and maintaining government office buildings, and installing heating systems, among other tasks. These efforts have saved the nation a significant amount of money. The young volunteers have also been tempered and grown healthily through their service.

In 1981, New York established the Life Volunteer Corps, with many students and citizens volunteering to repair Central Park over four years. This not only solved the city government's financial difficulties but also elevated the idea that "serving others is serving oneself." Recently, New York has also recruited 100 part-time and 300 full-time "volunteers" to engage in tasks such as painting houses, cleaning parks, assisting the elderly, and tutoring elementary and middle school students.

Some volunteers have also taken the initiative to help alcoholics and drug addicts reform, while others visit prisons to befriend inmates, hoping they will return to the right path after their release. Organizations like the "Anti-Smoking Association" and the "International Visitors Center" are also quite common in the United States. Society places great importance on volunteer services, and some institutions prioritize applicants who have participated in volunteer work over those with high academic achievements. During political campaigns, volunteer service is particularly crucial, and it is rare for a candidate who has not engaged in volunteer work to be elected.

In recent years, some states have mandated that students participate in community labor services. In Atlanta, high school students must provide 75 hours of volunteer labor to hospitals, daycare centers, or other non-profit organizations to graduate.

Last October, during his election campaign, the current U.S. President Bush cited the California Conservation Corps as an example, expressing his administration's hope to assist local communities in establishing similar public welfare organizations and promoting volunteer services. It is reported that to strengthen the universality of volunteer services, the White House is drafting a national plan to establish a youth service corps.

### 美国国民志愿服务  提高公民道德　激发国民责任感　满足社会需要

　　美国国民志愿服务
    提高公民道德　激发国民责任感　满足社会需要
    本报记者  刘开宸
    美国，时下正试图推行国民志愿服务，据说是为了提高公民道德、重新激发国民的责任感和满足社会的需要。
    不久前，美国南卡罗莱纳州曾就人生目标对本州高中学生作了一次调查，从１９７６年到１９８６年，想“赚大钱”的人数大大增加，而“寻求人生目标与意义”的人数又大幅度减少了。有识之士在惊叹之余，担心美国国民精神腐化，尤其是对青年一代热衷于物质享受的现象深表忧虑。一些教育界人士惊呼，这是“我们所面临的危机”。
    目前，美国迫切需要辅导教师、护理人员、医疗助理，以及森林、农场、公园、社区工人等，但许多人认为这些工作赚钱不多，对其没有兴趣。由于预算紧缩，政府对托儿、抚养老人、救济贫民、游民和残疾人等基本社会需要，难以满足。热心人士考虑解决的办法，就想到美国早期立国时，国民联合起来，为公益贡献力量的情况，也想到罗斯福总统在新政时期成立的美国历史上最大的国民劳动服务组织——平民保育团的情况。
    １０多年来，美国已有几个州在试行志愿服务。加利福尼亚州早在１９７６年就成立了保育工作团，先后约有４万青年参加，他们在扑灭森林火灾，救援水灾，消灭地中海果蝇、协助地方社区兴建公园、为政府办公大楼清理照明设备、装设暖气系统等方面努力工作，替国家节省了大笔费用。青年们在志愿服务中也受到锻炼，健康地成长。
    纽约在１９８１年成立了生活义工团，许多学生、市民志愿参加，用４年时间修复了中央公园。既解决了市政府财政短缺的困难，又提高了人们“服务别人，也是服务自己”的思想。近来，纽约还招募了１００名兼职和３００名专职“义工”，从事粉刷房屋、打扫公园、协助老人、指导中、小学生作业等工作。
    有的志愿服务者还主动参加帮助酗酒者或吸毒者改过自新的工作，有的则到监狱去同囚犯交朋友，希望他们在刑满释放后走上正路。至于“戒烟协会”、“国际访问者中心”之类的义务服务组织，在美国就更多了。社会对义务服务十分重视，有些院校招收学生不是完全看成绩，而是优先考虑参加过义务服务的青年。在竞选公职时，义务服务显得尤为重要，当选前未做过义务服务的代表是很少的。
    近几年，有些州还硬性规定学生要参加社区的劳动服务。在亚特兰大城，高中生必须为医院、日间托儿所或其它非盈利机构提供７５小时的义务劳动，才能毕业。
    现任美国总统布什去年１０月在竞选中，曾以加利福尼亚州保育工作团为例，表示他的政府希望协助各地成立类似的地方公益团体，鼓励义务服务工作。据透露，为加强志愿服务的普及性，白宫正在制订一项关于建立青年服务团的全国性计划。
