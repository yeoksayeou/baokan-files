Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 31st - (Reporters Fang Zhengjun, Correspondent Pan Feng) The Wuhan Public Security Bureau today issued a warning through the media to young people across the country: the so-called "Chinese Young Literary and Artistic Workers Association" is a scam created by criminal element Huang Ge Xin. Young people who are preparing to send money or manuscripts should immediately stop sending money or manuscripts to it.

According to the Qiaokou District Public Security Bureau of Wuhan, since mid-December 1988, Huang Ge Xin, a 19-year-old junior high school dropout from Huang Zhai Village, Huangpi County, Hubei Province, has privately carved official seals and forged documents. He rented a hotel in Wuhan and privately printed and mailed over 17,000 copies of the "Chinese Young Literary and Artistic Workers Association" charter. He used the names of famous writers Wang Meng, Bai Hua, Qin Mu, Xu Chi, and 15 others to form the so-called "Chinese Young Literary and Artistic Workers Association" advisory committee and recruited members, demanding membership fees.

Currently, Huang Ge Xin has been detained for investigation by the public security authorities.

　　武汉公安局提醒各地青年
    中国青年文学艺术者协会纯属骗局
    据新华社武汉３月３１日电  （记者方政军、通讯员潘峰）武汉市公安局今天通过新闻界提醒全国青年朋友注意：所谓“中国青年文学艺术者协会”是犯罪分子黄革新制造的骗局，准备汇款和寄稿的青年马上停止给它汇款、寄稿。
    据武汉市公安局硚口分局介绍，１９８８年１２月中旬以来，湖北省黄陂县黄寨村１９岁的初中毕业的农民黄革新先后私刻公章，伪造批文，在武汉租借旅馆，私自印刷邮寄了１７０００多份“中国青年文学艺术者协会会章”。他盗用著名作家王蒙、白桦、秦牧、徐迟等１８人的名义，组成所谓“中国青年文学艺术者协会”的顾问委员会，并发展会员，索要会费。
    现在，黄革新已由公安机关收容审查。
