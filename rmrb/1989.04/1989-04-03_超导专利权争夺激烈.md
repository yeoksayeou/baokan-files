The competition in superconductivity research has sparked a fierce battle among the United States, Japan, and Europe over patents in this field. The number of patent applications in this area is particularly high among Japanese applicants. Since 1986, Japanese companies and universities have submitted over 2,000 superconductivity patent applications, overwhelming the Japanese Patent Office. This trend of applications continues to grow. Sumitomo Electric Industries alone has submitted over 700 applications. Japanese interests have also extended to Europe and the United States. The professional journal in the superconductivity field, *Cambridge Communications*, surveyed the first 76 superconductivity patent applications in Europe, finding that 59 of them were submitted by Japanese applicants, accounting for nearly 80%, while Europe and the United States had only about 10.

The competition for superconductivity patents is aimed at securing future profits. Some research institutions have already begun to benefit even before their patents are approved. The University of Houston in the United States developed a new superconductive material with broad application prospects. Although the relevant patent has not yet been approved, the university has already received $4.3 million in licensing fees from DuPont Company. The University of Houston's patent management personnel said this is the largest patent income the university has ever received. Companies or research institutions that own superconductivity patents can use them to fend off potential competitors or charge licensing fees to users of the technology. This has created a strong incentive for superconductivity research institutions and companies. The manager in charge of superconductivity commercial development at DuPont, Mr. Mead, said, "The urge to participate is so strong, everyone wants to try to gain a dominant position." His words reflect the mindset of various superconductivity patent competitors.

The patent application process is lengthy. The United States keeps the contents of applications confidential, while in Japan and European countries, patent applications are published 18 months after submission. Currently, patent lawyers are just beginning to review superconductivity patent applications submitted at the beginning of 1987. The United States has recognized the beneficial impact of accelerating the review process for superconductivity patent applications on industry. Former President Reagan requested last year that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office expedite the review of superconductivity patent applications through a special fast-track channel. However, to date, no country has published a patent for superconductive materials or superconductivity research.

The competition for superconductivity patents has raised concerns in the scientific and patent communities. Scientists worry that the spread of superconductivity patent competition will hinder the progress of superconductivity research itself, as research institutions and inventors fear that if a competitor obtains a patent that restricts others' use, their years of effort will be wasted. This will also affect investors' enthusiasm. The U.S. patent authorities are more concerned that Japan will monopolize the Japanese market, making it difficult for U.S. superconductivity products to enter. Patent agent Tanster put it vividly: "I think they have laid a patent minefield in Japan, making it very difficult to enter." Patent experts are also worried that this "minefield" will expand to Europe.

### 超导专利权争夺激烈

　　超导专利权争夺激烈
　　韩淦如
    超导研究的角逐已引起美、日、欧对超导研究专利的争夺。这方面的专利申请尤数日本人的数量为多。自１９８６年以来，日本公司和各大学提出的超导专利申请已有２０００多项，大有淹没日本专利局之势。这种申请的热潮至今仍呈增长之势。仅住友电子工业公司独自提出的申请就已超过７００件。日本人的触角还伸向了欧、美。超导领域的专业杂志《剑桥通讯》对欧洲最早的７６项超导专利申请作过调查，其中５９项是日本人提出的，占了近８０％，欧美只有１０来项。美国专利局负责超导专利的戈得伯格透露，至１９８８年１１月底，美国已接受６５０项超导专利申请，其中外国申请２２５项，而有１５０项来自日本。
    现在争夺超导专利权，是为了不久的将来获得更多的利润。有的研究机构甚至在专利尚未批准之前就已开始受益。美国休斯敦大学研制出一种应用前途广泛的超导新材料，尽管有关的专利还未获批准，但该校因此已从杜邦公司获得４３０万美元的使用许可费。休斯敦大学的专利管理人员说，这是该校获得的最大的一笔专利权收入。拥有超导专利权的公司或实验机构可以据此来防范潜在对手，或向使用该项技术的用户收取许可证费用。这对超导研究机构或公司产生了巨大的诱惑力。杜邦公司负责超导商业开发的经理米德说：“想参与其中的冲动竞是如此的强烈，总想试试看能否取得统治地位”。他的这番话，很能反映各类超导专利竞争者的心态。
    专利申请是个漫长的过程。美国对所申请的内容是保密的，而在日本和欧洲各国，专利申请要在提出１８个月以后才能公布。眼下，专利专家律师们才开始审查１９８７年初上报的超导专利申请。美国已经认识到加快超导专利申请审理的程序对工业的有利影响。前总统里根在去年就要求美国专利及商标局按一个特殊的快速渠道审批超导专利申请。不过，到目前为止，还没有一个国家公布过一项超导材料或超导研究的专利。
    各国对超导专利权的争夺已在科技界和专利界引起一些忧虑。科学家们担心，超导专利权争夺的蔓延，势必妨碍超导研究工作本身的进展，因为研究机构和发明人担心，一旦竞争对手获得一项可限制他人使用的专利，自己多年的努力就白白浪费，而这也会影响投资者的投资热情。
    而美国的专利机构则更担心日本会垄断日本市场，使得美国超导产品难以打入。专利代理商坦斯特说得很形象：“我认为，他们在日本布下了一个专利地雷区，打入日本将很困难。”专利专家们还忧虑，这种“地雷区”会扩展到欧洲。
