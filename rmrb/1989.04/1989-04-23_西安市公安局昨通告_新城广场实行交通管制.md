The Xian Public Security Bureau issued a notice this morning: Traffic control will be implemented 24 hours a day at the New City Square, the location of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, and its three main intersections.

This morning, orderly columns of armed police were on duty at the main streets around the square. There were many people on the streets, and the order around the square had basically been restored.

The New City Square is littered with bricks, stones, and broken glass left by the hooligans. Most of the trees have been destroyed, the lawns trampled beyond recognition, and a burned-down warehouse still smoldering. The provincial government's burned cars are strewn haphazardly in the courtyard. Many passersby, witnessing this scene, felt indignant. A middle-aged woman said, "The country has been founded for nearly 40 years, and Xian has never seen such a thing. They dare to burn civilian houses in broad daylight; their hearts are too black." The director of the provincial communications office, Ma Shouyun, said, "These rioters must be severely punished by law."

　　西安市公安局昨通告    
    新城广场实行交通管制
    新华社西安４月２３日电  西安市公安局今天早晨发出通告：对陕西省政府所在地的新城广场及其３个主要路口实行２４小时交通管制。
    今天上午，一队队武警战士秩序井然地在广场周围主要街道上执勤。街上的人很多，广场周围的秩序基本恢复平静。
    新城广场到处可见歹徒们留下的砖头、石块和玻璃碎片。大多数树木已被毁坏，草坪被踏得不像样子，一间被烧毁的库房还冒着余烟。省政府被烧毁的汽车横七竖八地倒在院内。许多过往行人目睹这一景象，感到愤慨。一位中年妇女说：“建国快４０年了，西安还从来没有发生过这样的事，大白天连民房都敢烧，心也太黑了。”省交通厅办公室主任马世猷说：“对这伙暴徒必须依法严惩。”
