Reclaiming Lake Land and Restoring the Lake: Birds Fly and Fish Thrive as Life Returns to Lake West of Huoqiu City

Only a year and a half after reclaimed land was returned to the lake, the West Lake of Huoqiu County in Anhui Province has once again become a vast expanse of water teeming with fish and crabs, and filled with the sounds of birds. Zhang Honghai, a 58-year-old local resident, has taken out his fishing boat and nets, which had been idle for over 20 years, and happily returned to the lake to fish.

The West Lake of Huoqiu City is one of the larger natural lakes and flood storage areas in the middle reaches of the Huai River, with a water storage area of 140 square kilometers. Twenty-three years ago, a certain unit reclaimed land from the lake bed, reducing the water storage area to 30 square kilometers, which could no longer serve its flood storage function. Farmers abandoned fishing for farming, and had no choice but to endure the hardship.

In 1986, central leaders listened to the people's opinions and decided to reclaim the land and restore the lake. Huoqiu County promptly implemented this decision.

After several years of effort, the West Lake has regained its vitality.

　　退田还湖　禽飞鱼肥
　　霍丘城西湖生机重现
    本报合肥４月１５日电　退垦还湖才一年多的安徽省霍丘县城西湖，如今已是烟波浩淼、鱼蟹竞游、飞鸟成群了。当地５８岁的张宏海老汉收拾好闲置了２０多年的小船、网具，高高兴兴地重返大湖去打鱼。
    霍丘城西湖是淮河中游较大的天然湖泊和蓄洪区之一，常年蓄水面积为１４０平方公里。２３年前，某单位在湖底围垦造田，使蓄水面积缩减到３０平方公里，不能发挥蓄洪作用，农民弃渔种田，有苦难言。
    １９８６年，中央领导同志听取群众意见，作了退垦还湖的决定，霍丘县抓紧实施。
　　经过几年努力，城西湖出现了勃勃生机。	　　　　　　（张传宣　沙明）
