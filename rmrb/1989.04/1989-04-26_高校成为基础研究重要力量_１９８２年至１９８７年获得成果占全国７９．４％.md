Universities Become a Major Force in Basic Research

From 1982 to 1987, Achievements Accounted for 79.4% of the Nation's Total

Beijing, April 25 (Xinhua) — A recent report indicates that universities have become a significant force in basic research in China.

The National Natural Science Foundation of China's "Grant Overview" states that since the establishment of the foundation, over 200 universities have received funding for basic research, accounting for approximately 60% of the total funds. The number of projects funded in universities also constitutes around 60% of the total projects funded by the foundation. Some universities receive up to 60% of their research funds from the foundation, which has significantly alleviated the previous shortage of funds for basic research in universities and enabled the advancement of teaching standards.

Universities have undertaken a number of high-level basic research projects. In recent years, the National Natural Science Foundation has funded several major projects with significant scientific and academic value, with over 50% of these projects being undertaken by universities. Additionally, over 60% of the high-tech and exploratory projects funded by the foundation are carried out by universities.

According to the "Grant Overview," universities have made substantial achievements in basic research in recent years. From 1982 to 1987, universities contributed 78.9% of the nation's total basic research publications and achieved 79.4% of the nation's total basic research results. In terms of the amount of funding received and the number of papers published internationally, Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Nanjing University are at the forefront of all universities.

　　高校成为基础研究重要力量    
    １９８２年至１９８７年获得成果占全国７９．４％
    本报北京４月２５日讯  记者陈祖甲报道：最近公布的一份统计表明，高等院校已经成为我国基础研究中的一支重要力量。
    国家自然科学基金会编印的《资助概览》说，自国家科学基金会成立以来，全国有２００多所高校的基础研究得到资助，金额占基金总额的６０％左右，获得资助的项目占国家基金资助总量的６０％左右。有的高校的３／５的科研经费来自科学基金的资助。这就初步扭转了过去高校基础研究经费不足，有些项目不能开展的状况。这也为提高高校的教学水平创造了条件。
    高等院校承担了一批高水平的基础科研任务。近两年，国家自然科学基金会资助了一批科学意义重大，学术思想先进的重大项目，其中５０％以上由高等院校承担。在基金资助的高技术、探索性项目中，６０％以上由高校承担。
    据《资助概览》统计，这几年，高等院校在基础研究方面取得了较大的成绩。从１９８２年到１９８７年，高等院校写出的基础研究论著占全国的７８．９％，获得的基础研究成果占全国７９．４％。其中，无论在获得基金资助金额和在国际上发表论文数量，北京大学、清华大学、南京大学列各高校榜首。
