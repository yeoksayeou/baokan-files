    Low-Fat Diets and Heavy Beer Drinking Pose Cancer Risks

    According to a recent report in a British medical journal, low-fat diets may increase the risk of cancer.

    A survey of 15,000 people in Scotland revealed that those with low cholesterol levels in their blood had a lower risk of heart disease but a higher incidence of cancer.

    Researchers at two hospitals in Glasgow found that only those with high cholesterol levels should switch to a low-fat diet.

    According to a recent report by the British Royal Cancer Research Fund, people who drink more than four liters of beer per week have twice the risk of developing pancreatic cancer compared to those who do not drink beer or drink only small amounts.

    The report states that researchers found that heavy beer drinkers are more likely to develop pancreatic cancer, but no such link was found with white wine, red wine, or other spirits. Experts point out that beer contains substances similar to the carcinogens produced by burning tobacco. Therefore, frequent heavy drinking of beer can lead to cancer.

    低脂肪饮食和嗜饮啤酒
　　有患癌症的危险
    本报伦敦电　据英国一家医学杂志最近报道，低脂肪饮食可增加患癌症的危险。
    在苏格兰15000人当中进行的一项调查证实，那些血液中含胆固醇低的人发生心脏病的危险也是低的，然而，却有更高的癌症发病率。
    研究人员在格拉斯哥两家医院进行的研究表明，只有那些高胆固醇者才应改为低脂肪饮食食谱。（文英）
    新华社北京4月8日电　英国皇家癌症研究基金会最近发表的一份报告说，每周饮用4升以上啤酒的人，比不饮啤酒或只饮微量啤酒的人患胰腺癌的可能性大两倍。
    报告说，研究人员发现嗜饮啤酒的人易患胰腺癌，但是，并未发现这种癌症与饮白酒、色酒及其他烈性酒有联系。专家们指出，啤酒与其他酒类饮料不同，它含有与香烟点燃后产生的致癌物质相同的物质。因此，经常暴饮啤酒会致癌。
