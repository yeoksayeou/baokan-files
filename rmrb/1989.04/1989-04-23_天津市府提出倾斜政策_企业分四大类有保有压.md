The mayor of Tianjin, Li Ruihuan, stated at the recent opening of the municipal people's congress that Tianjin will comprehensively utilize investment, credit, fiscal, tax, and price economic measures to adopt inclined policies. This will ensure the priority development of the automotive, electronics, and petrochemical industries, as well as 10 key industries such as mechanical equipment, textiles, and durable consumer goods, and 60 key products.

To implement the "Decision on Key Points of Industrial Policy" by the State Council, Tianjin will actively expand the production of key or flagship products such as submersible pumps, engineering machinery, cotton textiles, and motorcycles. It will also increase the production of basic raw materials such as pig iron, high-quality short-process steel, soda ash, and caustic soda. Efforts will be made to develop high-tech products such as fiber optic communication equipment, numerical control machine tools, and program-controlled exchanges. The city is determined to reduce or eliminate 35 products that lack vitality.

It is understood that Tianjin has classified 1,261 enterprises into four types and will optimize policy allocation to differentiate treatment. In terms of tax policy, enterprises producing and operating products such as tobacco, alcohol, watches, and air conditioners (a total of 30 types) will not be exempted from product tax or value-added tax. Small enterprises such as small breweries, small cotton mills, and small rolling mills (a total of 8 types) will not be exempted from product tax, value-added tax, or income tax. Micro-profit enterprises will no longer receive tax exemptions. Various companies that originally enjoyed tax concessions will be taxed according to the law.
