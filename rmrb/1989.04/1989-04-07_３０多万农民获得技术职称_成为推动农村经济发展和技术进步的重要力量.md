Over 300,000 Farmers Obtain Technical Titles
Become a Key Force in Promoting Rural Economic Development and Technological Progress
People's Daily, Beijing, April 6th

Reporter He Huangbiao reports: Farmers in China, who traditionally did not have a technical title system, have now started to obtain their own technical titles. Currently, 22 provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, and directly-administered municipalities have completed the first round of farmer technical title evaluations. Over 300,000 people have been evaluated as farmer assistant technicians, farmer technicians, farmer assistant technicians, and farmer technicians. These farmers with technical titles are becoming an important force in promoting rural economic development and technological progress.

This news was obtained by the reporter today from the China Association for Science and Technology.

In recent years, with the deepening of rural reforms and the development of commodity production, over 100 million farmers have participated in various practical technology training sessions. They have become science and technology demonstration households or technical backbones in various professional technology research associations and societies. Timely evaluation of technical titles is not only their strong desire but also an affirmation of the results of mass training activities in rural areas and the technical level of farmers. For this reason, a year ago, the China Association for Science and Technology, the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries, the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, and the Ministry of Forestry jointly formulated and issued the "Provisional Regulations on the Evaluation and Promotion of Farmer Technical Personnel Titles," which have been implemented in rural areas nationwide.

Farmers who have been evaluated for technical titles are not included in the national staffing system, do not require national funds, and do not increase the burden on the people. However, they have established a team of local scientific and technological talents in rural areas who can be supported, retained, and utilized.

Farmers' technical titles are evaluated based on the scientific knowledge, technical level, and contributions of each individual. Generally, they must undergo assessment and examination, which includes both professional basic knowledge and practical business skills, with a focus on practical abilities. During the evaluation, no numerical quotas are allocated, and everyone participates in fair competition, thereby stimulating farmers' enthusiasm for learning science, mastering technology, striving for progress, and competing for excellence.

　　３０多万农民获得技术职称
    成为推动农村经济发展和技术进步的重要力量
    本报北京４月６日讯  记者何黄彪报道：历来没有技术职务序列的中国农民，开始有了自己的技术职称。目前，已有２２个省、市、自治区、直辖市完成了第一次农民技术职称评定工作，３０多万人被评定为农民助理技术员、农民技术员、农民助理技师、农民技师。已取得技术职称的一代新型农民，正在成为推动农村经济发展和技术进步的重要力量。
    这一消息，是记者今日从中国科协获悉的。
    近年来，随着农村改革的深入和商品生产的发展，已有１亿多农民参加了各类实用技术培训，他们已成为科技示范户或各类专业技术研究会、协会中的技术骨干，适时评定技术职称，既是他们的强烈愿望，也是对农村群众性培训活动成果和农民技术水平的肯定。为此，一年前由中国科协、农牧渔业部、水电部、林业部联合制订颁发了《农民技术人员职称评定和晋升试行通则》，在广大农村贯彻试行。
    被评为农民技术职务的农民技术人员，不列入国家职工的编制，不要国家费用，不增加群众负担，但为农村建立起了一支养得起、留得住、用得上的乡土科技人才队伍。
    农民技术职称是按照每个人所掌握的科学知识、技术水平和贡献大小来评定的。一般都要经过考核和考试，既考试专业基础知识又考核实际业务能力，以实际能力为主。评定时不分配数量指标，人人参加公平竞争，从而调动了农民学科学、钻技术、求上进、争成才的积极性。
