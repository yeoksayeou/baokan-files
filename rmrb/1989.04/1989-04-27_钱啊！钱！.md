	Money! Money!

	Zhai Naizeng

	Some people say that in today's society, there are three things that are abundant: big hats (referring to high-ranking officials), old head tickets (referring to currency), and deputy section-level researchers. It is obvious that there are many people with big hats and deputy section-level researchers. However, saying that "old head tickets" are abundant seems inaccurate. The most popular topic of conversation among people when they meet and chat is money, and it is about the lack of money. Do you think "old head tickets" are abundant or scarce?

	If one says that currency is abundant, it is probably because some people have a lot of money, and indeed, they have a lot. Who are these people? Those who stand in the market or by the roadside, big and small "speculators," certain individuals who use their power for personal gain, and those who dance and sing on stage... They have a lot of money in their pockets, so their consumption level is naturally high.

	If one says that currency is scarce, it is indeed correct. Take my classmates, for example; most of them started working at the age of fifteen; in terms of education, the lowest is a "middle technical" degree; in terms of savings, despite working outside for ten years, each had only about a thousand yuan when they got married, which is considered a new start. However, when they think about it, look at it, and compare it with others, it seems a bit pitiful. To say they are not working hard is really a misunderstanding. Although everyone is engaged in some coal mining work that others do not want to do, their conscience is good, but their pockets are empty. It is already a struggle to afford a set of furniture, let alone modern appliances.

	However, today, whether one has a lot of money or a little, everyone seems to have set their sights on one goal: "old head tickets." A colleague said, "They say that those who stand by the roadside have full pockets but empty heads, but we have full heads but empty pockets. We should think about balancing this out." It is time to balance it out. Not only are we thinking about this, but those engineers, graduate students, and college students who have quit their jobs or dropped out of school, the reason for their quitting or dropping out is probably related to this as well. However, one should not jump to conclusions; perhaps one day, some people will see through it and be able to let it go. Isn't it said that money is a mad beast in a cage? This mad beast in a cage will surely breed another large group of mad beasts. I really don't know if "old head tickets" are abundant or scarce, and I don't know if it is good to have a lot or a little.

　　钱啊！钱！
    翟乃增
    有人说，现今社会有三多：大盖帽、老头票、副处调。说大盖帽、副处调（指处级调研员）多，那是显而易见，说“老头票”（指人民币）多，似乎不太准确。人们见面闲谈最热门的话题是钱，并且是缺钱，您说“老头票”是多还是少？
    说钞票多，大概是因为有人票子多，而且实在是多。什么人呢？站市场的、站路旁的，大小“倒爷”，某些以权谋私者，以及在舞台上扭来扭去扯着嗓子喊的……他们口袋里钱多，消费水平自然就不用说了。
    说钞票少，确实也正确。就说我同学吧，大多是从十五岁起便离家走上社会了；论学历，最低也是个“中技”；说积蓄，尽管在外闯荡十年，结婚时每个只有千元左右，可谓新事新办了，只是想起来、看起来、和别人比起来，有点可怜兮兮。说他们不努力，实在冤枉。虽然大家都从事一些人不愿干的煤矿工作，可他们的良心好，只是口袋里钞票少。能置办一套组合家具已甚感吃力，更不用说电器化了。
    然而，在今天，无论是钱多的还是钱少的，大家似乎都看准了一个目标：“老头票”。一位同事说：“人家说站马路边的是口袋里满满的，脑袋里空空的，可咱们是脑袋里满满的，口袋里空空的，应该想法平衡平衡。”是该平衡了，考虑这个问题的何止是我们，那些辞职或退学的工程师、研究生、大学生们，究其辞职或退学的原因，恐怕也与此有关吧。不过也不能枉下结论，或许有一天有些人会看破，能想开。不是有人说，钱是疯狂的困兽吗？这头疯狂的困兽，想来也会孳生出另一大批疯狂的困兽。真不知老头票是多还是少，更不知是多好还是少好！（作者单位：山东枣庄市峄城区经贸委）
