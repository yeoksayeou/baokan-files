	Experts Emphasize Pros and Cons; Authorities Act Swiftly
	Xinjiang Cancels Plan to Build Power Station in Swan Lake

	XINHUA, Urumqi, April 1 -- Recently, relevant departments in Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, heeded expert advice and abandoned a plan to build a reservoir and power station in the Swan Lake Nature Reserve.

	The Swan Lake Nature Reserve, located in the Yurdus Basin in the central Tian Shan Mountains, is a famous gathering and breeding ground for swans worldwide. It is also China's only national-level nature reserve primarily dedicated to the protection of swans. To promote local agricultural and industrial development, relevant departments in the autonomous prefecture planned to build a reservoir with a capacity of approximately 600 million cubic meters to develop the water resources of the Kedu River. This would also ensure that the 12-tiered hydropower stations in the area could operate normally during the dry winter season.

	Yuan Guoming, deputy researcher at the Xinjiang Environmental Protection Research Institute, led an evaluation team. After more than half a year of on-site investigations and deliberations, the team concluded that building the reservoir would submerge most of the swan breeding and activity areas in the reserve, causing devastating damage to the Swan Lake Nature Reserve. At a recent review meeting, attending experts unanimously endorsed the above conclusion.

    新疆取消在天鹅湖内建电站计划
    新华社乌鲁木齐４月１日电  （中国环境报记者郑世福、新华社记者姜志武）最近，新疆维吾尔自治区巴音郭楞蒙古自治州有关部门听从专家意见，放弃了一项在天鹅湖自然保护区内修水库、建电站的计划。
    位于天山中部尤尔都斯盆地的巴音布鲁克天鹅湖保护区，是世界著名的大天鹅集中繁殖地，也是我国唯一以保护天鹅为主的国家级自然保护区。为了促进当地工农业生产的发展，自治州有关部门计划在这里修建一个库容量约６亿立方米的调节水库，以开发开都河水利资源，并保证这里的１２级梯级水电站在冬季枯水期也能正常运转。
    新疆环境保护研究所副研究员袁国映率评价组，经半年多实地考察论证，认为在这里建水库将会淹没这个保护区的绝大部分天鹅繁殖地和活动区，使天鹅湖保护区受到毁灭性破坏。在最近召开的评审会上，与会专家一致赞同上述结论。
