　　全国男子举重赛又破三项全国纪录
    新华社铜陵４月１２日电　（记者郭庆华）在安徽省铜陵市举行的全国男子举重锦标赛捷报频传。今天又有３项全国纪录被改写。
    在今天下午的８２．５公斤级比赛中，解放军队蔡炎书出手不凡，他在挺举的第三次试举中，把２００公斤的杠铃稳稳举在头顶，使他自己保持的这项１９８公斤的全国纪录成为昨天的历史。他的抓举成绩是１６０公斤，因而以３６０公斤的总成绩同时打破了由他保持的３５７．５公斤的全国纪录。这个级别的３项冠军也由他一人囊括。
    ９０公斤级的比赛在晚上进行。辽宁选手朱明武在挺举的第三次试举中，以１９７．５公斤的成绩刷新了山东马文广于１９８７年创造的１９６．５公斤的全国纪录，并获得这个项目的冠军。接着，山东李炳军、吉林邬子健在第四次试举中都要了１９８公斤的重量，试图刷新刚刚产生的新的全国纪录，但没能如愿。
    获得９０公斤级抓举第一名的是山东李炳军，成绩为１５７．５公斤；这个级别总成绩的冠军也为朱明武所获，成绩是３５２．５公斤。
