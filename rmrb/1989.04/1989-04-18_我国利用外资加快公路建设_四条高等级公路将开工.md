China will continue to utilize foreign investment to accelerate highway construction. This year, four high-grade highways funded by World Bank loans will commence.

According to officials from the Ministry of Communications, since 1985, when China began using World Bank loans to build rural roads and the Beijing-Tianjin-Tanggu Expressway, this year will see the continued use of World Bank loans for the construction of national trunk lines.

It is understood that the four high-grade highways to be constructed this year are all part of China's national trunk lines. These four projects are the Chengdu-Chongqing First- and Second-Class Highway, the Nanchang-Jiujiang First-Class Highway, the Shaanxi San Yuan-Chengdu First-Class Highway, and the Jinan-Qingdao First-Class Highway, totaling 692 kilometers. The World Bank will provide $350 million in loans for these projects.

It is understood that these projects will all be bid out according to international conventions to select the best construction units, and the construction will fully implement the engineer supervision system. Currently, these projects have been or are being bid out. Recently, a World Bank delegation visited China to inspect these projects and expressed satisfaction with the bidding and evaluation process.

It is revealed that these projects will all commence construction in the second half of this year.
