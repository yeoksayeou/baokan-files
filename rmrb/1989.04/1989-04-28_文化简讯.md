The exhibition of artifacts unearthed from the ancient capital of the State of Qi in Linzi, jointly organized by the Palace Museum and the People's Government of Linzi District, Zibo City, Shandong Province, opened on April 25 in the East Wing of the Qianqing Palace of the Palace Museum. Linzi was the capital of the State of Qi during the Zhou Dynasty and is renowned for its rich cultural relics, often referred to as an "underground museum." In recent years, tens of thousands of artifacts have been unearthed, many of which are national treasures. Among the 186 precious artifacts on display are bronze, pottery, porcelain, gold and silver, jade, stone, and iron items. The "Dragon Pattern Giant Bronze Mirror" is particularly captivating. It measures 115 centimeters in length, with a dragon pattern on the back, arc patterns on the edges, and a button base with a persimmon pattern. It is the largest bronze mirror ever unearthed in China.

The exhibition of works by Spanish artist Antoni Tàpies began on April 25 at the National Art Museum of China. The works include lithographs, etchings, aquatints, copperplate prints with ink and watercolor, resin, varnish, and collage.

The first comprehensive reference work on Manchu studies, "The Great Dictionary of the Manchu People," is set to be published. To achieve the goals of comprehensive coverage, innovative entries, and accurate explanations, the publisher, Liaoning University Press, held an expert review meeting on April 25. More than ten renowned experts in ethnic history, Manchu history, and Qing history, including Pu Jie, attended the meeting.

The first national commercial workers' song competition, with over 10,000 participants, concluded in Beijing after eight months of competition. The winners of the first, second, and third prizes in the categories of folk singing, bel canto, and popular singing are Wang Qinzhen from Hubei, Zhang Chunmei from Henan, and Wang Qiang from Guangdong, respectively.
