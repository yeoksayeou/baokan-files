Who could believe that the "Water Planet" Earth, with an average water depth of 2,800 meters, would face a water crisis?

However, this is a fact. Industrial pollution makes it difficult for billions of people around the world to find clean water to drink. Every year, over 500 million people fall ill due to using unclean water, and more than 10 million people die from it.

Who could believe that Sichuan, known as the "Land of Abundance" with over 1,000 rivers and a flow equivalent to eight Yellow Rivers, would have nearly 10,000 people writing letters and visiting annually due to water disputes?

However, this is a fact. Industrial "three wastes" have polluted 80% of Sichuan's water bodies to varying degrees, causing significant issues for the lives and economies of many counties and towns.

"Dragon and Snake" Dance of Confusion

This is what the reporter saw and heard during the inspection of Chengdu, Neijiang, Zigong, Leshan, and other regions by the State Council's Environmental Protection Committee:

The Chengdu Dujiangyan Paper Mill discharges over 3,000 tons of wastewater daily, turning the Jiang'an River black for dozens of kilometers. The downstream fields of five or six counties use this water for irrigation, and many people wash vegetables and clothes by the river. Some water-scarce areas even drink this black water. According to Sichuan officials, this situation is not unique to the Jiang'an River. The province has over 800 paper mills, both state-owned and village/neighborhood-operated, discharging 470 million cubic meters of wastewater annually. Out of 1,400 large and small rivers, most are polluted.

In Weiyuan County's coal mine and Tongzi Township in Peng County, there are dozens of miles of traditional coke ovens. The area is filled with thick smoke, and the sky is gray. It is said that in places like Longchang, Guangyuan, Luzhou, Yongchang, and Rongchang, similar scenes can be seen. The province produces over 150,000 tons of traditional coke annually. Each ton of coke produced releases one ton of wastewater containing harmful substances like phenol, cyanide, and sulfur compounds into the rivers.

Tests show that during the dry season, some river sections have phenol concentrations exceeding the national standard by 1,249 times and cyanide concentrations exceeding the standard by 7 times.

Sichuan, with an industrial output value of 5.3% of the national total, accounts for about 10% of the national sulfur dioxide and wastewater emissions. If the 600 million tons of silt Sichuan discharges annually from the Wuxia Gorge were transported to the estuary using trucks with a 4-ton capacity, lined up at 5 meters per truck, a "yellow dragon" would appear along the river every day. If the same method were used to transport Sichuan's 330 million tons of annual wastewater, five or six "poisonous snakes" filled with polluted water would pass through every day. Undoubtedly, the dancing "dragons and snakes" cause severe harm to the Yangtze River basin, and Sichuan is the first to suffer the consequences.

This is a report from Chuyong County's Jiangmen River: Before 1984, the river was rich in aquatic life, with over 10,000 jin of fish caught annually. After the Xingwen County Dongyang Paper Mill started operations, the catch dropped to 150 jin, precious fish species disappeared, and over 6,000 people along the river faced water shortages.

This is an appeal from seven townships in Ziyang County's Baohu District: The once-clear and beautiful Yanghua River, with lush green banks, was famous as the "Flower River." After the Ziyang Zhonghe Paper Mill and a chemical plant discharged wastewater into the river, it turned into a foul-smelling ditch. At dusk, even river crabs and shrimp had to crawl onto the riverbank to spend the night, let alone the more than 10,000 villagers who rely on this water for irrigation and drinking.

This is data from Zigong City's Daan District Environmental Protection Department: The four paper mills in the upper Yangtze River's Neijiang region discharge large amounts of wastewater daily, turning the Changtan River into a black, foul-smelling river. Students and teachers at a middle school that uses this river water have suffered 3,860 cases of skin diseases, 1,700 cases of frequent diarrhea, 210 cases of chronic diarrhea, and over 200 cases of hepatitis, nephritis, and enteritis in recent years.

Water Equals Money

Sichuan's environmental problems are severe and have become a reality. Faced with this grim situation, people show different attitudes.

The confession of a traditional coke producer, Mr. Liu: I am a millionaire, and I learned to produce traditional coke during my 8 years in prison. After my release, I started these traditional coke kilns with money from friends and relatives. The local small coal mines used to be on the verge of closure, but now many people learn from me to produce traditional coke, saving the small coal mines and increasing coal prices. In the past, villagers were so poor they couldn't afford oil for their noodles, but now they can work temporarily at the kilns, earning over 10 yuan a day, and they are much richer. You say traditional coke production is polluting, and I've heard about it, but I've been producing it for 8 years, and my health is fine. These few years of operating the kilns haven't caused any pollution-related deaths here.

A fruitless conversation: A city-level leader said, small paper mills are a tough problem, and there are no good treatment technologies yet. Shutting them down would harm local finances and leave the workers unemployed. Not shutting them down would harm the people along the river. It's tough! For now, we can only ask these mills to manage better and pollute less, waiting for good treatment methods to completely solve the problem. A scientist took over the topic, saying small paper mills' pollution treatment is impossible, and even if a treatment method is found, it would be like "tofu priced as meat." Someone asked if pollution should continue. The scientist fell silent.

A mayor's worry: Thank you to the upstream regions for building water reservoirs with us on a mutually beneficial basis, allowing the entire city's residents to drink first-class sweet water. But the few small coal mines and traditional coke plants in the water source protection area make me uneasy. Although the province and sister cities have made efforts, and they have taken good management measures, the coal mine's waste and coke plant's slag are continuously silting up the riverbed, especially during the flood season, many harmful substances flow into the reservoir. If this area were under our jurisdiction, we would have relocated these small coke plants long ago, but this is a sister city's area, and we can't do much.

Several elderly women from the city area with no one to complain to: They covered their noses with handkerchiefs and pointed to the foul-smelling steam from the neighboring bristle factory, saying, "This smell is worse than feces, making it hard to live. The factory's wastewater flows into the opposite river, making it filthy. Recently, we heard they were going to relocate, but they can't bear to give up this dirty money, so they started operating again. We've talked about this until we're hoarse, but no one listens."

An unregulated factory: Look, this factory's garbage truck dumped waste at the picturesque Dujiangyan Bottle Mouth. Besides ruining the scenery, if this continues, won't it ruin the 2,000-year-old world-class engineering masterpiece? Inquiring with the relevant departments, it turns out this factory, relying on its provincial government jurisdiction, does stupid things for convenience, and the county's "small officials" can do nothing about it.

Survival requires a good environment, but in the environment, people and nature are so out of harmony, especially today with the rapid development of industrial production. Water has become an indispensable condition for industrial and mining enterprises' production. According to experts' estimates, producing 1,000 degrees of electricity requires 100-500 cubic meters of water, smelting 1 ton of iron and processing it into steel requires 300 cubic meters of water, smelting 1 ton of aluminum requires 1,500 cubic meters of water, producing 1 ton of synthetic fiber requires 1,200-1,800 cubic meters of water, and producing 1 ton of paper requires 200-500 cubic meters of water... Water is money. With water, there are ways to make money. The downstream can set up enterprises, so why can't the upstream? You use water, he uses water, why should I save water? You discharge pollutants, he discharges pollutants, why should I treat them? You suffer, he suffers, why shouldn't I suffer?

This mindset traps many people in a vicious cycle, and no one can escape the punishment caused by their own disharmonious behavior.

Difficult Steps in Treatment

Faced with the severe situation of industrial pollution, is there a way to treat it? People are thinking and exploring.

The Sichuan Provincial Government took decisive measures, issuing the "Order to Stop Traditional Sulfur Production Polluting and Destroying the Environment," determined to treat the resource-wasting and severely polluting traditional sulfur production sites.

Chengdu City is accelerating the construction of a centralized pulp mill for paper mills to treat pollution. This can concentrate and treat 90% of the black liquor equivalent to five or six paper mills, reducing pollution, and recover 75% of the caustic soda, increasing economic benefits.

Neijiang City included sewage treatment in its urban construction plan, investing over 4.6 million yuan to build over 1,000 biogas septic tanks, achieving harmless sewage discharge for part of the urban residents.

The Buxi River section in Zigong City was black and foul-smelling 15 years ago, with no fish or shrimp, and the health of residents along the river was affected. After long-term efforts, it has been initially treated, and the water is gradually clearing up, with fish and shrimp beginning to return.

However, the steps are difficult.

The population is large, the foundation is weak, and environmental protection debts are high. The province's pollution load is more than three times the national average and seven times the world average, while the funds used for pollution treatment only account for 0.3% of the national income, less than one-third of the needed amount, and 50% lower than the national average.

Sichuan Province has over 100 million people, but there is no bureau-level institution to manage the province's environmental work. Under the provincial environmental protection committee's signboard, there is only one person handling daily work.

Although significant achievements have been made in treating industrial pollution in recent years, environmental protection regulations have been formulated, and some regions have adopted rotation training and other methods to strengthen enterprise leaders' environmental protection awareness, the traditional concept of prioritizing the economy over environmental protection has not been completely reversed across the province. After the environmental protection committee's inspection, a factory director promised to treat the pollution within a month, but why couldn't it be treated before? A large sewage pipe was damaged by the river water, why wasn't it repaired during the dry season last year, but only after the inspection team's check did they promise to repair it during the dry season this year? Out of 4,000 petitions and 4,000 letters of appeal annually due to environmental pollution, how many are properly handled according to environmental protection regulations? The centralized pulp mill with good social benefits can achieve over 7 million yuan in taxes and profits annually, fully capable of repaying the investment, but why can't 500 million yuan in loans be found to fill the gap caused by price factors, allowing it to be completed earlier? It is known that replacing traditional coke production with mechanical coke can save energy and reduce pollution, but why can't appropriate policies and effective measures be formulated to support it? Many wastewater treatment technologies are available, but why are they directly discharged into rivers, harming the downstream...

People's living environment needs the care and protection of the entire society. If you are a leader, what have you done for environmental treatment?

If you are an ordinary citizen, is your behavior in harmony with the environment?

　　面对生命之泉的污染
    ——随国务院环委会考察组赴川采访札记
    本报记者  谢联辉
    谁能相信，全球平均水深达２８００米的“水星”——地球，会出现水的危机？
    然而，这是事实。工业污染使世界上十几亿人难以找到干净的水饮用，每年有５亿多人因使用不洁水而致病，其中１０００多万人丧生。
    谁能相信，拥有１０００多条河流、其流量相当于８条黄河的“天府”——四川，每年会因水的纠纷，有近万人次来信来访？
    然而，这是事实。工业“三废”使四川８０％的水域遭受不同程度的污染，在许多县镇已经困扰着人们的生活和经济。
    “龙蛇”群舞的困惑
    这是随国务院环委会赴四川考察组沿途考察成都、内江、自贡、乐山等地区看到的、听到的：
    成都市都江造纸厂每天哗哗排放的３０００多吨废水，把江安河几十公里的河水染黑，沿岸五六个县的大田用这里的水灌溉，有不少人在河边洗菜、洗衣，有些缺水的地方还得饮用这种黑水。据四川省同志讲，这种状况非江安河所独有，全省有国营、乡村、街道纸厂８００多个，年排污水达４．７亿立方米，１４００多条大小河流中大部受到污染。
    在威远县一个煤矿，在彭县的通济乡，有连绵十几里地的土法炼焦群。这里浓烟滚滚，连天都是灰蒙蒙的。听说隆昌、广元、泸县、永川、荣昌等十几个县，都可以看到如此场面。全省用这种办法生产土焦炭１５０多万吨。烟尘污染不说，每炼土焦１吨，就要向河里排放１吨含有酚、氰、硫化物等有毒有害污水。
    抽测表明，有的河段在枯水季节，酚的含量超过国家标准１２４９倍，氰化物含量超过７倍。
    工业总产值占全国５．３％的四川，主要污染物二氧化硫和废水的排放量，均占全国总排放量的１０％左右。若把四川每年从巫峡输出的６亿吨泥沙用４吨装载量的卡车运到入海处，按５米一辆车沿江拉开，几乎每天会出现这样一条“黄龙”。要是用同样的方法运输四川每年排放的３３亿吨废水，则几乎每天都有五六条装着污水的“花蛇”串过。无疑，群舞的“龙蛇”给长江流域带来严重的侵害，而四川则首先自食其果。
    这是来自叙永县江门河的报告：１９８４年前，河里水产丰富，每年可捕捞万余斤河鱼。自从兴文县东阳造纸厂投产后，捕鱼量下降到１５０公斤，名贵鱼类绝迹，沿江６０００多人生活用水困难。
    这是资阳县保和区７个乡镇政府联名的呼吁：昔日的阳化河，清澈见底，两岸碧绿成荫，是有名的“花溪河”。自资阳中和纸厂和一个化工厂向河内排污水后，这里变成了臭水沟，黄昏时，连河虾、螃蟹都得成群结队爬上河滩度夜，更不要说靠这水灌溉、饮用的万余名村民。
    这是自贡市大安区环保部门提供的数据：地处长江上游的内江地区４个造纸厂，每天排放大量废水使长滩河变成黑色的臭水河。饮用该河水的一所中学师生，近几年来患皮肤病的有３８６０人次，经常腹泻的１７００多人次，慢性腹泻的２１０人次，肝炎、肾炎、肠炎患者２００多人次。
    水等于钱的世界
    四川的环境问题严峻，已经成为事实。面对严峻的形势，人们表现出不同的心态。
    炼土焦个体户刘老板的自白：我是万元户，曾在监狱里蹲了８年，学会了炼土焦。劳改出来后，由亲朋凑点钱办起这几眼土焦窑。这一带小煤窑的煤原来卖不出去，濒于关闭，现在许多人学我用煤烧土焦，小煤窑救活，煤炭还涨价了。过去村民穷得吃面没油，现在可以到土窑做临时工，一天１０多元，富多了。你说炼土焦有污染，我都听说过，可我炼了８年，身体不是好好的？开土窑这几年，这里也没见污染死了人。
    一次没有结果的对话：一位市级领导干部说，小造纸厂污染严重是老大难，目前还没有很好的治理技术。关掉吧，地方财政受损失不算，厂里这些人怎么安排？不关吧，沿江群众怎么办？难啊！现在只好要求这些厂管理好点，少污染点，等有了好的治理办法再彻底治理。一位科学工作者接过话题说，小纸厂污染治理不可能，即使研究出治理办法，也是“豆腐花成肉价钱”。有人问，是否就让污染继续下去？后者默然。
    一位市长的忧虑：感谢上游地区在互利基础上同我们合建水库，使全市居民喝上了一级质量的甜水。但饮用水源保护区内的几个小煤窑、土炼焦场，总使人心里不踏实。尽管省里、兄弟市为此做了努力，他们也采取了较好的管理措施，可是煤矿的矸石、炼焦的土渣在不断淤塞河床，特别是洪水季节，场内许多有害物质冲入水库。倘若这里属我们市管辖，早就把这几个小焦场搬迁了，可这是兄弟市的地方，鞭长莫及。
    几位告状无门的市区老太婆：她们一只手拿手帕捂着鼻子，另一手指着隔壁猪鬃厂冒出的熏人蒸气说，这气味比大便还臭，叫人真没法活。还有厂里的臭水，流到对面河里，肮脏死了。前不久听说要搬迁，可总舍不得不挣这缺德的钱，又开工了。为这事说破了嘴皮，就是没有人听。
    一个不受管束的工厂：你看，这个工厂的垃圾车来到风景如画的都江堰宝瓶口上哗啦一下倒下来了。且不说破坏了景致，这样长期下去，岂不是把２０００多年前精心设计的世界第一流工程糟踏了？询问有关部门，原来这个厂仗自己是省府所辖，为图方便干蠢事，县里的“小官”奈何不得。
    生存需要良好的环境，然而在环境中人与人、人与自然又是如此不协调，特别是工业生产迅速发展的今天，水已经成为工矿企业生产中不可或缺的条件。据专家们估算，每生产１０００度电需水１００—５００立方米，炼１吨铁并加工成钢材需水３００立方米，炼１吨铝需水１５００立方米，生产１吨人造纤维需水１２００—１８００立方米，生产１吨纸需水２００—５００立方米……水就是钱，有了水，就有了来钱的门路。下游能办企业，上游为什么不可以办企业？你耗水，他耗水，我为什么要节约？你排污，他排污，我为什么要治理？你受害，他受害，我又何尝不受害？
    这种思想使许多人坠入了怪圈，谁也逃脱不了自己不协调行为导致的惩罚。
    步履艰难的治理
    面对工业污染严峻的形势，有没有办法治理？人们在思考、在探索。
    四川省政府采取果断措施，发布《关于制止土法生产硫磺污染破坏环境的指令》，下决心治理浪费资源大、污染严重的土法炼磺场。
    成都市为治理造纸厂污染，正在加紧建设造纸公司集中制浆厂，既可以把相当于五六个造纸厂９０％的黑液集中处理，减少污染，又可以回收７５％的烧碱，增加经济效益。
    内江市把粪便处理列入城建规划，投资４６０多万元，建设沼气化粪池１０００多处，已使城镇部分居民的粪便实现了无害排放。
    自贡市的釜溪河段，１５年前河水发黑发臭，鱼虾绝迹，沿岸市民健康受到危害。经过长期的努力，已初步得到治理，现在水渐渐变清，鱼虾开始复生了。
    可是，步履是艰难的。
    人口多，底子薄，环境保护欠帐多。全省污染负荷高于全国平均水平的３倍以上，高于世界的７倍，而用于治理污染的资金，只占国民收入的０．３％，不足需要数的１／３，比全国平均水平低５０％。
    四川省１亿多人口，连管理全省环境工作的局级机构都没有，在省环委会牌子下，也只有一个人处理日常工作。
    纵然近几年在治理工业污染方面取得了不小成绩，制订了环保法规，部分地区采取轮训等办法强化企业领导环保意识，但从全省来看，并没有完全扭转人们重经济、轻环保的传统观念。一个厂长在环委会考察组抽查后，表示在一个月内保证治好污染，为什么就不能在这之前治理呢？一条大排污管道被江水冲坏，为什么不在去年枯水季节修好，而要在考察组检查后才表示等到今年枯水期修复？全省每年因环境污染有４０００多人次上访，４０００多封上诉信，有多少是依环保法规妥善处理的？社会效益好的集中制浆厂，投产后每年税利可实现７００多万元，完全有能力偿还投资，为什么找不到５００万元贷款弥补物价等原因造成的缺口，以早日竣工？明知道用机焦取代土法炼焦，既节约能源，又减少污染，为什么不能制订适当的政策，采取有效的措施加以扶持？许多明明有技术可以治理的废水，为什么也要直接排到江河贻害下游……
    人们生存的环境需要全社会关心、爱护。如果你是一位领导者，你为治理环境做了些什么？
    如果你是一位普通公民，你的行为是否与环境相协调？
