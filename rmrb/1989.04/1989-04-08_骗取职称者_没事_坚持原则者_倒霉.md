	Those who fraudulently obtain professional titles face no consequences, while those who uphold principles face trouble. The former deputy principal of WuGang Secondary School in Shaoyang, Su Changyuan, fabricated three years of elementary school teaching experience, one year of middle school teaching experience, over one year as a temporary elementary school administrator, and ten years as a class advisor to ensure his wife was promoted to a first-level middle school teacher.

	WuGang Secondary School principal and Shaoyang People's Congress representative Wang Yaochu reported this issue to the relevant departments. After an investigation by the county professional title reform office, the county education commission, and WuGang Secondary School, it was confirmed that Wang Yaochu's allegations were entirely accurate. However, before the relevant departments could take action, Su Changyuan and his wife used their connections to take the forged professional title materials to LuCheng Secondary School in LuXi County. On November 7 of last year, with the approval of the county education commission's professional title reform office and the WuGang Secondary School party branch, Wang Yaochu sent the investigation materials to the Huaihua region. Upon learning this, Su Changyuan sent three telegrams: one to the municipal education commission stating, "Wang Yaochu is causing trouble in Huaihua and obstructing public duties. Please handle this seriously." Another to the WuGang county education commission stating, "Wang Yaochu is stirring up trouble in Huaihua, which has a bad influence. Please handle this seriously." The third to the WuGang county committee stating, "Please have the county committee remove Wang Yaochu from his post and investigate him." Strangely, after sending the three telegrams, the situation changed. The person who fraudulently obtained the professional title not only faced no consequences but also received sympathy from several leading agencies, while Wang Yaochu, who upheld principles, encountered trouble. Recently, some people have been saying that Wang Yaochu's position as principal should be revoked. How strange!

　　骗取职称者——没事  坚持原则者——倒霉
    原邵阳市武冈二中副校长粟长元为了他的妻子能破格评为中学一级教师，竟然为她伪造了３年小学教龄、１年中学教龄，以及１年多小学临时负责人、１０年班主任的资历。
    邵阳市人大代表、武冈二中校长王耀楚向有关部门反映了这一问题。经县职改办、县教委、武冈二中联合调查组查证，王耀楚检举揭发的情况完全属实。但是，在有关部门还没有处理前，粟长元夫妇便通过关系，携带伪造的职称材料到溆浦县一中任教去了。去年１１月７日，王耀楚征得县教委职改办和武冈二中党支部的同意，将联合调查组的调查材料送给了怀化地区。粟长元得知后，一连拍了３封电报，一封拍给市教委：“王耀楚在怀化闹事，妨害公务，请严肃处理。”一封拍给武冈县教委：“王耀楚窜到怀化制造事端，影响极坏，请严肃处理。”一封拍给武冈县委：“请县委将王耀楚撤职查办。”奇怪的是，３封电报拍出后，情况发生了变化，骗取职称者不但没受到处理，还深受几家领导机关同情，而坚持原则的王耀楚却遇到了麻烦。最近，一些人传出话来，说要撤销王耀楚的校长职务，岂不怪哉！
