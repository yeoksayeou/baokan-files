The Ministry of Machinery and Electronics periodically recommends new energy-saving products and phases out high-energy, low-performance products.

People's Daily, Beijing, March 31st. Reporter Pí Shùyì reports: Currently, China has announced 10 batches of 437 mechanical and electrical products that are high in energy consumption and low in performance and need to be phased out. Vice Minister of the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics, Táng Zhòngwén, said that these outdated products must be phased out. This year, the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics will work with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce and other departments to inspect the phasing-out of these products and periodically announce new energy-saving products.

Mechanical and electrical products are widespread and consume a lot of energy. Just 20 categories of products, such as fans, pumps, and compressors, consume 70% of the country's annual electricity. Since 1982, the mechanical and electrical industry has been updating and replacing these 20 categories of products. By the end of 1988, more than 2,000 energy-saving products had been developed. The work of phasing out outdated products has also made progress. Currently, all series of old small and medium-sized transformers have been phased out on schedule, and many industrial furnaces, industrial boilers, compressors, and internal combustion engines with poor performance have also been basically phased out on schedule.

Today, the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics recommended 20 new energy-saving products to users in Beijing, including welding machine safety energy-saving devices, resin dry-type transformers, new speed control devices, industrial boiler microcomputer automatic control optimization systems, and new electric meters.

　　机电部定期推荐节能新产品
    能耗高性能差的及时淘汰
    本报北京３月３１日讯  记者皮树义报道：目前，我国已公布１０批４３７项能耗高、性能落后的淘汰的机电产品。机电部副部长唐仲文说该淘汰的产品必须淘汰。今年，机电部将会同国家工商局等部门检查这些产品的淘汰情况，并定期公布节能新产品。
    机电产品量大面广，消耗能源多。仅风机、水泵、压缩机等２０类产品年耗电量就占全国发电量的７０％。从１９８２年开始，机电工业对这２０类产品进行更新换代，到１９８８年底已开发出２０００多种节能产品。淘汰落后产品工作也取得进展。目前，中小型变压器老产品已全系列按期淘汰，工业电炉、工业锅炉、压缩机、内燃机等不少性能落后的产品也基本按期淘汰。
    今天，机电部在京向用户推荐了２０种节能新产品，其中有电焊机安全节电装置、树脂烧法干式变压器、新型调速装置、工业锅炉微机自控优化系统、新型电度表等。
