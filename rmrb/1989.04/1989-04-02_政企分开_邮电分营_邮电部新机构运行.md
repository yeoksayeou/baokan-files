Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 31st.

The new structure of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, organized according to the "three-definition" plan, will officially begin operations on April 1. It will gradually move towards the separation of government and enterprise, and the split of telecommunications and postal services.

Since October of last year, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has implemented this plan in three steps. The first step was to completely separate government and enterprise functions for the postal and telecommunications industry, materials, and stamp issuance agencies. These agencies removed the "bureau" sign and revoked their administrative functions. The second step was to implement internal accounting for postal and telecommunications management agencies. The General Post Office and the General Telecommunications Bureau strengthened their operational functions, and the Communications Bureau was established to exercise administrative functions, creating conditions for the future separation of government and enterprise, and the split of telecommunications and postal services. The third step is to achieve "two separations" from top to bottom based on these foundations. Now, the tasks required by the plan have been basically completed.

　　政企分开　邮电分营
    邮电部新机构运行
    据新华社北京３月３１日电  （记者杨理科、实习生姜歆远）按“三定”方案组建的邮电部新机构４月１日正式投入运行，它将逐步走上政企分开、邮电分营的道路。
    自去年１０月始，邮电部分三个步骤落实这个方案。第一步对邮电工业、物资和邮票发行机构，完全实行政企分开，摘掉局的牌子、撤销其行政职能，第二步对邮电通信管理机构试行内部核算，邮政、电信总局加强经营职能，设立通信司行使行政职能，为以后政企分开邮电分营创造条件；第三步是在此基础上，自上而下实现“两分”。现在方案要求的各项任务已基本完成。
