Since April 1987, the fertilizer quality inspection personnel of our county, in conjunction with the county standards and metrology bureau and the county industrial and commercial administration bureau, have conducted inspections on fertilizers sold in five districts and towns. A total of 17 samples and 494 tons of fertilizer were inspected. Out of these, only 7 varieties and 276 tons of fertilizer were found to be of qualified quality, while the rest were unqualified. The relevant production and sales departments should strengthen the supervision and inspection of fertilizer quality.

　　化肥质量太差如何种庄稼
    一九八七年四月以来，我县化肥质量监测人员会同县标准计量局和县工商管理部门，先后对五个区、镇经营的化肥作了检查，共抽查了十七个样品、四百九十四吨化肥，除七个品种、二百七十六吨化肥质量合格外，其余均不合格。有关生产和销售部门应切实加强化肥质量的监督检查。
