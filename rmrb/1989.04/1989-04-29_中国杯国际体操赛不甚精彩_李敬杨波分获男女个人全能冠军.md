The China Cup (Samsung) International Gymnastics Competition, after two rounds of competition, produced the men's and women's all-around champions. Chinese athletes Li Jing and Yang Bo won the gold medals in these two events with a significant advantage.

The more than 50 male and female athletes participating in this year's China Cup competition lacked internationally renowned strong contenders. The host country's Chinese team's athletes were clearly superior to their opponents but only performed at an average level. The East German athlete, who finished fourth in the men's all-around at the Olympics, Tippelt, made a mistake on the parallel bars, falling to the ground, and only scored 56.100 points, placing third in the all-around. Li Jing from Hunan and Li Ge from Sichuan scored 57.550 and 57.250 points respectively, winning the gold and silver medals for the Chinese team. Two other Chinese athletes, Zhang Wei and Qiao Liang, scored third and fourth respectively. According to the rules, only two athletes from the same country can be counted, which allowed Tippelt, who was originally in fifth place, to step onto the podium to receive the bronze medal.

In the women's all-around competition, due to the significant difference in skill levels among the athletes, and the frequent mistakes made by the Chinese girls who were clearly stronger, the competition became tense at times. In the end, the young Chinese athlete Yang Bo won the gold medal with a score of 38.800. The Hungarian athlete, Giselle Valeria, won the silver medal with a score of 38.450. Another Chinese athlete, Fan Di, was leading for most of the competition but made a mistake on the balance beam, causing her all-around ranking to drop to third. Chen Cuiting, who was widely expected to perform well, did not secure an all-around ranking.

　　中国杯国际体操赛不甚精彩    
    李敬杨波分获男女个人全能冠军
    本报北京４月２９日讯  记者汪大昭、吴骅报道：１９８９年中国杯（三星）国际体操赛经过两场角逐，先后产生了男女个人全能名次。中国选手李敬和杨波以较大优势，分别夺得这两项比赛的金牌。
    参加今年中国杯赛的５０多名男女选手中，缺乏在国际体坛颇具名气的强手。东道主中国队的运动员水平明显在对手之上，但也只发挥出一般水平。奥运会男子全能第四名、民主德国的梯佩尔特在双杠上空翻转体失误，跌落在地，仅以５６．１００分排在个人全能第三位。来自湖南的李敬和四川的李舸分别以５７．５５０分和５７．２５０分，为中国队赢得冠、亚军。中国队另两名选手张伟和乔良积分分别排第三、四位，按规定同一国家只能取两名选手的成绩，使本来位居第五的梯佩尔特有幸登台领取铜牌。
    女子个人全能比赛，由于运动员之间水平相差悬殊，而实力高出一截的中国姑娘多次出现失误，使得竞争一度紧张起来。最后，中国小将杨波以３８．８００分获得冠军。匈牙利的吉斯·瓦莉娅以３８．４５０分获银牌。中国队樊迪曾一路领先，但在平衡木上的失误，致使全能名次退居第三。被普遍看好的陈翠婷未能取得全能名次。
