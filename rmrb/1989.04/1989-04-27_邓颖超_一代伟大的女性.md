To commemorate Comrade Deng Yingchao's 70 years of revolutionary activities, at the request of the editors of the book "Deng Yingchao - A Great Woman of the Generation," I wrote a short article as the preface to this book.

Comrade Deng Yingchao is a highly influential elder in our Party and one of the few outstanding women in modern Chinese history. Our contemporaries respect her, the broad masses of the people love her, and even some foreign friends and politicians admire her. Everyone affectionately calls her "Deng Da Jie" (Deng Big Sister).

Our Deng Da Jie, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, has struggled tenaciously for several decades for the liberation of the Chinese people and the cause of socialist construction, for the realization of the communist ideal, and has made important contributions to the country and the people. In the year of the May Fourth Movement, she was only 15 years old but with great enthusiasm, she joined the revolutionary tide against imperialism and feudalism. In Tianjin, she organized the Women's Patriotic Association and the Students' United Association, and together with Comrade Zhou Enlai and others, she organized the Awakening Society. She took an oath: "I am willing to dedicate my life to the cause of the revival of the Chinese nation." During the first period of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, she worked in the Women's Department of the Kuomintang Central Committee as a Communist Party member and was elected as a candidate member of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee, working tirelessly to fight for the freedom and liberation of women. In the years of white terror under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, she risked her life to carry out the Party's secret work and made special contributions; during the arduous Long March of 25,000 li, she, despite being seriously ill, with unyielding will, climbed snow-capped mountains, crossed grasslands, and persevered to reach Shaanxi. During the second period of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, under the direct leadership of Comrade Zhou Enlai, she actively promoted the formation and development of the United Front against Japanese aggression, establishing close relationships with prominent figures in various circles in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, and mobilizing women and children to participate in the anti-Japanese and national salvation movement in various ways. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, to strive for domestic peace and oppose Chiang Kai-shek's launch of a civil war, she successively served as a member of the Communist Party delegation in Chongqing and Nanjing, using various opportunities to expose the Kuomintang reactionaries' tricks and expound the Communist Party's proposal for peaceful construction. After the liberation of the whole country, she participated in the work of establishing the All-China Women's Federation and became one of the leaders of women in New China, working tirelessly to achieve true gender equality and the liberation of women. After the overthrow of the Jiang Qing counter-revolutionary clique, she held important leadership positions in the Party and the state, doing a great deal of work. Especially in the work of the domestic and international united front and promoting the unity of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to achieve reunification as soon as possible, she played an important role and had a significant impact. She supports the correct policies of reform and opening up of the Party and the state, and in her exchanges with domestic and foreign people, she widely propagates them. Although she is now advanced in age, she is not the least bit lazy, and even if she does not hold a leadership position, she is still diligent and actively engaged in work within her abilities. From Deng Da Jie's extraordinary 70-year revolutionary career, we are enlightened, see an example, and revolutionaries should all strive like her for the nation and the country.

Our Deng Da Jie not only has a tenacious fighting spirit but also has many excellent qualities and styles worth learning from. She is practical and does not seek empty fame; she is strong and optimistic, never discouraged by difficulties; she is warm-hearted, open, approachable, always thinking of the broad masses, and always leaving warmth and care for the comrades around her; she is frugal and simple, has high moral character, strict style, considers problems thoroughly, and everyone who has come into contact with her feels that she is not only an outstanding revolutionary but also a very approachable "big sister."

When we talk about Deng Da Jie, we naturally think of Comrade Zhou Enlai. She is Comrade Zhou Enlai's intimate companion and a capable assistant. For more than half a century, she has weathered storms with Comrade Zhou Enlai, walked hand in hand, shared hardships, and struggled together in the most difficult, dangerous, and trying times. On the long road of revolutionary life, she and Comrade Zhou Enlai have known and loved each other, completely and thoroughly merging their personal and family happiness into the great cause of struggling for communism. People all praise them as a model couple.

Our Deng Da Jie is now 85 years old. As she herself says, "The body ages, the heart is red, the will does not wane," "As long as there is life, there is struggle." She is continuing to work hard for the country and the people with this spirit. Her name, along with her achievements, will be recorded in the glorious annals of the Chinese nation.

　　邓颖超——一代伟大的女性
    李先念
    为纪念邓颖超同志从事革命活动七十周年，应《邓颖超——一代伟大的女性》一书编者的要求，我写了一篇短文，作为这部书的前言。
    邓颖超同志是我们党内很有影响的一位老同志，也是中国现代史上为数不多的杰出女性之一。我们同辈人尊敬她，广大人民群众爱戴她，就是一些外国友人和政治家也敬仰她。大家都亲切地称她为“邓大姐”。
    我们的邓大姐，在党中央和毛泽东同志的领导下，为中国人民的解放事业和社会主义建设事业，为共产主义理想的实现，英勇顽强地奋斗了几十年，对国家和人民作出了重要贡献。“五四”运动那年，她刚刚１５岁，就以极大的热情投入到反帝反封建的革命洪流中，在天津组织妇女爱国同志会、学生联合会，并和周恩来等同志一起组织觉悟社。她立下誓言：“愿将一生献给中华民族奋起复兴的事业”。在第一次国共合作时期，她曾以共产党员身份参加国民党中央妇女部的工作，并被选为国民党中央候补执行委员，为妇女的自由和解放而辛劳奔波。在蒋介石统治下的白色恐怖的年代，她冒着生命危险坚持党的秘密工作，有特殊的功绩；在艰苦卓绝的二万五千里长征中，她虽身患重病，仍以顽强不屈的意志，爬雪山、过草地，坚持跋涉到达陕北。第二次国共合作时期，在周恩来同志的直接领导下，她积极推动抗日民族统一战线的形成和发展，在国统区和各界知名人士建立了密切的关系，广泛发动妇女、儿童以各种方式参加抗日救亡运动。抗日战争胜利后，为争取国内和平，反对蒋介石发动内战，她先后在重庆、南京任中共代表团团员，利用各种机会揭露国民党反动派的骗局，阐述共产党的和平建国主张。全国解放后，她参加了创建全国妇联的工作，成为新中国妇女的领袖之一，为争取真正实现男女平等和妇女解放而呕心沥血。粉碎江青反革命集团以后，她担任党和国家的重要领导职务，做了大量工作。尤其在国内国际统一战线工作和促进海峡两岸团结，早日实现统一的工作中，发挥了重要作用，产生了重大影响。她拥护党和国家改革开放的正确政策，在与国内外人士交往中广为宣传。她现在虽年事已高，但毫不怠倦，即使不担任领导职务，也仍然勤勤恳恳，积极从事自己力所能及的工作。从邓大姐不平凡的７０年革命生涯中，使我们受到启迪，看到榜样，革命者都应当像她那样为民族为国家而奋斗不息。
    我们的邓大姐不仅有顽强的奋斗精神，还有许多值得我们学习的优良品德和作风。她讲求实际，不图虚名；坚强、乐观，遇到困难从不沮丧；她热情、开朗、平易近人，心里装着广大的群众，总把温暖和关怀留给周围的同志；她艰苦朴素，情操高尚，作风严谨，考虑问题周到，同她接触过的每个人都感到，她不仅是一位杰出的革命家，而且是一位十分令人亲近的“大姐”。
    我们讲到邓大姐，就很自然地想到周恩来同志。她是恩来同志的亲密伴侣，又是得力的助手。半个多世纪以来，她与恩来同志风雨同舟，携手并进，患难与共，在最艰苦，最危险，最困难的年代共同奋斗。在多年的革命生活道路上，她与恩来同志相知相爱，把个人的、家庭的幸福，完全彻底地融入了为共产主义而奋斗的伟大事业中。人们都称赞他们是一对模范夫妻。
    我们的邓大姐，而今已步入８５岁高龄，正如她自己说的“人老，心红，志不衰”，“生命不息，战斗不止”。她正以这种精神继续为国家和人民而努力地工作着。她的名字，将同她的业绩一起，载入中华民族光荣的史册。
    邓颖超——一代伟大的女性！
