Title: To Hold a Meeting or to Tour the River?
Author: Shū Xīn
Date: 1989-04-15
Edition: 6

Recently, I saw an invitation letter for the "Long River Journey" book ordering meeting and book distribution seminar. This event is organized by 15 publishing units: China Friendship Publishing Company, China Federation of Literary and Art Circles Publishing Company, Writers Publishing House, Beijing People's Fine Arts Publishing House, Sanlian Bookstore, Workers Publishing House, New China Publishing House, Huaxia Publishing House, Masses Publishing House, Cultural Art Publishing House, China Folk Literature Publishing House, China Foreign Translation and Publishing Corporation, Rural Reading Materials Publishing House, Sichuan People's Publishing House, and Yunnan People's Publishing House, along with the China Book Corporation. The event is hosted by the Business Weekly Newspaper ("Invitation letter attached").

Anyone with a keen eye can see that this is an event disguised as a meeting but actually a publicly funded tour. At a time when the central authorities have repeatedly banned publicly funded tours and called for a few years of austerity, is this appropriate? Why can't other more frugal methods be used to conduct business activities? I hope the relevant departments will look into this.

　　开会乎？游江乎？
    最近，我看到一封“长江之行”图书订货会暨图书发行研讨会的“邀请信”，这项活动由中国友谊出版公司　中国文联出版公司　作家出版社　北京人民美术出版社　生活、读书、新知三联书店　工人出版社
　新华出版社　华夏出版社　群众出版社　文化艺术出版社　中国民间文艺出版社　中国对外翻译出版公司　农村读物出版社　四川人民出版社　云南人民出版社１５家出版单位和中国图书联合公司发起，经贸周刊报社承办（“邀请信”文附后）。
    明眼人一看便知，这是一次以开会为名，实搞公费旅游的活动。在中央三令五申禁止公费旅游，提出过几年紧日子之际，这样做对吗？为什么不能用其它节俭的方式开展业务活动呢？希望有关部门过问一下。
