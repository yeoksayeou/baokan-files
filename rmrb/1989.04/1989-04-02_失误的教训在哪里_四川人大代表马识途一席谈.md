    Where Are the Lessons from the Mistakes?
    —A Speech by Sichuan People's Congress Representative Ma Zitui

    Reporter Gao Xinqing

    “Last year at the People's Congress, I published a short article in the People's Daily titled ‘I Am Still Thinking.’ Over the past year, I have continued to think.” Sichuan Federation of Literature and Art Circles Chairman, Sichuan Writers' Association Chairman, and renowned senior writer Ma Zitui spoke slowly. “The first thing I think about is that it seems China cannot avoid reform, even if we encounter various difficulties, we still need to reform. Retreating is not an option, and the people will not agree. The current difficulties can only be solved through reform.”

    “The second thing I think about is that without a stable political and social environment, rectification and reform cannot be carried out, let alone reform. The third point is that without the leadership of the Communist Party, without the unified command of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, there will only be chaos. No matter what traditional remedies or Western medicines are used, they will not work, and they cannot cure China's problems.” He also pointed out that perhaps someone might mock it as a “Song of Righteousness,” but in the current difficult situation, singing such a “Song of Righteousness” might make some people clear-headed.

    “You ask what else I think about? I think about where the root cause of last year's events lies? Or where the fundamental mistake lies?”

    “Comrade Xiaoping and Comrade Li Peng's report frankly admitted that they are correct. I wonder why every few years our minds become heated, leading to certain decision-making mistakes? It all comes down to two points. The first point is that when we carried out economic system reforms, we did not seriously and appropriately carry out political system reforms, we did not strive to build democracy and the rule of law, we did not establish decision-making on a more democratic and scientific basis, and we did not establish an effective supervision mechanism.” Ma Zitui believes that the most fundamental aspect of political system reform is to strive to improve the National People's Congress, this fundamental national system, and to institutionalize and legalize the political consultation and democratic supervision of the CPPCC. He said, if the people have full rights and normal channels to express their will, the power organs can effectively supervise the government in terms of law and work, and not just stop at the form of “meeting representatives” and raising hands to agree; if the CPPCC members with various knowledge and political experience can participate in democratic consultation during decision-making and democratic supervision during execution, and not just stop at the level of “if you don't say it, it's white, if you say it, it's also white” consultation, making the power organs truly powerful and the consultative organs truly consultative, plus public opinion supervision, increasing transparency, many mistakes can be avoided. At last spring's People's Congress and CPPCC session, everyone criticized the overheating and over-fast development of the economy, demanding that the development speed be pressed to within 10%, and not allowing double-digit inflation. To stabilize the economy, the most sensitive and difficult price and wage reforms must be particularly cautious, all of which were written into the resolution of the conference. Why did the speakers speak earnestly, and the listeners listen lightly? After the “August Storm,” there was a regret of “seeing things late in spring,” was it “seeing things late,” or simply not listening to the representatives and members' opinions at all?

    “The second point, I think that when carrying out material civilization construction, we did not simultaneously grasp spiritual civilization construction, leading to a big slide in spiritual civilization. Improper party style leads to corruption, and the spread of ugly phenomena such as seeking profit, mutual betrayal, and deceit. Social behavior norms and moral standards suitable for the development of socialist commodity economy have not been well formed.” He believes that it is not that the central authorities have not grasped it, but that there are not many effective methods and effective results.

    At the end of the conversation, Ma Zitui said: “There are still some things I have not thought through, and I need to continue thinking.”

### 失误的教训在哪里——四川人大代表马识途一席谈

　　失误的教训在哪里
    ——四川人大代表马识途一席谈
    本报记者  高新庆
    “去年人大，我在《人民日报》上发了一篇短文叫《我正在想》。这一年来，我还在想。”四川文联主席、作协主席、著名老作家马识途以缓缓的语气谈着。“我想的第一点，看来中国不搞改革不行，即使遇到这样那样的困难还得改革，后退是没有出路的，人民也不会答应。当前的困难，也只有改革才能解决。”“我想的第二点是，没有稳定的政治社会环境，治理整顿无法进行，改革更谈不上。第三点，中国的事没有共产党的领导，没有党中央和国务院的统一号令，只会天下大乱。不管用其他什么祖传秘方、西洋妙药都不管用，治不了中国的毛病。”他还指出，可能有人讥之为“正气歌”，但在目前困难的情况下，唱唱这样的“正气歌”可能令某些人头脑清醒。
    “你问我还想什么？我想去年发生的事，根子在哪里？或者说最根本的失误在哪里？”
    “小平同志讲的，李鹏同志报告里坦率承认的都是对的。我想为什么过几年我们头脑就要发热一次，出现某些决策失误呢？无非来源于两条，第一条是我们进行经济体制改革的时候，没有配套地认真进行适度的政治体制改革，没有努力进行民主法制建设，没有把决策建立在更民主和更科学的基础上，没有建立有效的监督机制。”马识途认为，目前政治体制改革中最根本的是努力完善人民代表大会这个国家根本制度和使政协的政治协商和民主监督制度化、法律化。他说，如果人民有表达自己意志的充分权利和正常途径，权力机关能对政府从法律上和工作上进行有效地监督，而不停留在“开会代表”、举手同意的形式上；如果拥有各方面知识和从政经验的政协委员们能参与决策时的民主协商和执行中的民主监督，而不停留在“不说白不说，说了也白说”的咨询水平上，使权力机关真当权，协商机关真协商，再加上舆论监督，增加透明度，许多失误可能避免。去年春的人大、政协会上，大家对经济过热、发展过快提出批评，要求把发展速度压到１０％以内，不许出现两位数的通货膨胀。要稳定经济，对最敏感的、难度最大的物价和工资改革出台要特别慎重，这都写进了大会的决议中。为什么言者谆谆，听者藐藐呢？“八月风潮”以后，有“春天见事迟”的悔悟，是“见事迟”，还是根本没有听进代表和委员的意见呢？
    “第二条，我认为在进行物质文明建设的时候，没有同时抓紧进行精神文明建设，出现了精神文明大滑坡。党风不正带来腐败，唯利是图、尔虞我诈、丑恶现象滋生。适合社会主义商品经济发展的社会行为准则、道德规范未很好形成。”他认为，不是中央未抓，而是没有多少有效办法，没有多少有效成果。
    谈话结束时，马识途说：“有些事我还没想透，还要继续想。”
