Tang Bao, born in 1913. Researcher at the Institute of Literature, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Expert in modern Chinese literature and Lu Xun studies, essayist. Author of "History of Modern Chinese Literature," "Creative Talks," "Tang Bao's Book Reviews," and "Shadow Collection," among others.

Tan: The main forms of literature in the new era—novels, poetry, and reportage—have received attention from literary researchers and critics, and have been given adequate evaluation. However, essays and miscellaneous writings seem to have not received much attention. I think this does not match their creative achievements. As the chairman of this national excellent essay (collection) and miscellaneous writing (collection) award committee, can you talk about your overall evaluation of essays and miscellaneous writings in the new era?

Tang: This national excellent essay (collection) and miscellaneous writing (collection) award is indeed very meaningful. There have been several national awards for novels, poetry, and reportage, but this is perhaps the first time for essays and miscellaneous writings since the May Fourth Movement. It is time for us to give them a fair evaluation.

Tan: You have written many essays and miscellaneous writings in the past, especially miscellaneous writings, some of which have reached the level of Lu Xun. You should have the authority to speak on the performance of these two genres in the new era.

Tang: I have always been attentive to these two genres. This time, participating in the award selection and reading more than 60 collections of essays and miscellaneous writings, I feel that the essays and miscellaneous writings of the new era have indeed reached a very high level. It can be said that compared to the era of Lu Xun, and compared to the period from the founding of the nation to 1978, the essays and miscellaneous writings of the new era have made breakthroughs. I personally think that miscellaneous writings have made even more breakthroughs than essays.

Tan: The second comparison is easy to understand, but saying that there have been breakthroughs compared to the era of Lu Xun, how do you understand that?

Tang: Of course, Mr. Lu Xun, as the founder of Chinese miscellaneous writings and as an individual creator, has reached a level of thought and artistic achievement that is hard for anyone today to match. However, if we consider it as a literary phenomenon, as a whole, and place it in the context of literary development history, I still think there has been development and breakthrough. Taking miscellaneous writings as an example, it has returned to the main theme of Lu Xun's era of intervening in life. I say "returned," not simply repeated. Since it is a return, there is a deeper layer to it, that is, the intervention in life by miscellaneous writings today is no longer just a few rebellious individuals throwing daggers and spears, but a large number of awakened individuals are devoting their loyalty to eliminating the old and creating the new. This is the trend of diversification in miscellaneous writings in the new era.

Tan: The diversification trend you mentioned, is it not just about the diversification of the miscellaneous writing team, but also includes other aspects of diversification?

Tang: Yes, the diversification I mentioned includes three aspects: First, the diversification of the author team. Miscellaneous writing authors are no longer just a few people in small rooms in the 1930s, but now include poets, novelists, reportage writers, scholars, natural scientists, those with high status, and those with humble backgrounds. This can be seen from the "Youthful Splendor" miscellaneous writing contest in the People's Daily; second, the diversification of thought content. As long as there are irrational phenomena in social life, they are all subjects for miscellaneous writings. This is different from Lu Xun's focus on political and cultural debates at that time; third, the diversification of literary styles. There are free-writing styles, story-like styles, those that focus on argumentation, satire, interpretation, criticism, and a variety of styles, not confined to one format, very interesting to read.

Tan: There was once a popular view that Lu Xun's style is a product of a high-pressure society, and now that the times have changed, Lu Xun's style should also become outdated. As the saying goes, "When the musician is gone, the music stops." What is your attitude towards this view?

Tang: This view has been around for a long time and is not just proposed now. During the 1939-1940 Shanghai period, there was a debate on whether the "Lu Xun style" was still needed. A Ying thought that the Lu Xun style had become outdated, while Ba Ren thought that the Lu Xun style had not become outdated because there were still traitors. A Ying was then editing the magazine "Literary Documents," mainly reprinting articles from liberated areas, and may have been influenced by the liberated areas.

Tan: In the early days of liberation, Feng Xuefeng published an article "Talking About Miscellaneous Writings," criticizing Huang Zhang's view on reviving miscellaneous writings and declaring that Lu Xun's style had become outdated.

Tang: Looking back now—whether from the perspective of social development or literary development—the view that Lu Xun's style should be abolished is quite naive and unrealistic. Can't there be satire and criticism within the people? I think it will still be needed even in a communist society. Moreover, our country has a long history of feudalism and directly jumped from a feudal society to a socialist society, skipping a stage of commercial economic development, so it is even more necessary to carry out criticism.

Tan: I think an author in the "Youthful Splendor" miscellaneous writing contest said something very interesting about this issue. Someone requires that the miscellaneous writings of the new society should differentiate themselves from Lu Xun's daggers and spears, and he asked: What is the difference between corrupt officials in the old and new societies?

Tang: I also noticed that. Setting this aside, I think abolishing Lu Xun's style does not make sense logically. In a capitalist society, newspapers can criticize the president. A socialist society is much superior to a capitalist society and should logically enjoy political democracy and creative freedom. Even in a feudal society, the emperor had special officials for remonstrance! I think that a society can tolerate the existence of miscellaneous writings, which itself is a sign of a clean society.

### 我观新时期散文和杂文——访唐弢

专栏：

　　我观新时期散文和杂文
    ——访唐弢
　　谭健　文　苗地　画
    唐弢，1913年生。中国社会科学院文学研究所研究员。中国现代文学专家，鲁迅研究专家，杂文家。著有《中国现代文学史》、研究文集《创作漫谈》、《晦庵书话》、杂文集《投影集》等。
    谭：新时期文学的主要形式——小说、诗歌、报告文学，得到了文学研究者和评论家的注目，给予了充分估价，但对于散文和杂文似乎未曾引起重视，我认为这与散文和杂文的创作实绩是不相符的。您作为这次全国优秀散文（集）、杂文（集）评奖委员会主任，能否谈一谈您对新时期散文和杂文的总体评价？
    唐：这次全国优秀散文（集）、杂文（集）评奖的确很有意义。小说、诗歌、报告文学，全国性的评奖有过好几次，但散文和杂文评奖恐怕是自“五四”以来第一次。现在到了我们应给它公正评价的时候了。
    谭：您早期写过不少散文和杂文，尤其是杂文，有一些曾经达到了与鲁迅乱真的程度。你对这两种文体在新时期的表现应该最有发言权。
    唐：我平素对这两种文体比较关注，这次参与评奖又阅读了包括散文和杂文的６０多本集子，我觉得新时期的散文和杂文确实达到了非常高的水准。可以这样说：比起鲁迅时代，比起建国后至１９７８年这一时期，新时期的散文和杂文都有突破。我个人认为杂文又比散文突破得更多一些。
    谭：您说的第二个比较容易理解，但说比鲁迅时代还有突破，怎样理解？
    唐：当然，鲁迅先生作为中国杂文的开山祖师，作为一个创作个体，他所达到的思想和艺术造诣，今人难以与之侔比。但是，如果作为一种文学现象，作为一个整体，将它放到文学发展史的大背景中去考察，我仍认为是有发展和突破的。以杂文为例，它又复归到鲁迅时代干预生活的主旨上来了。我说的是复归，不是简单的重复，既是复归，就有更深一层的东西，那就是现在杂文的干预生活已经不是过去仅仅靠那么几个反骨人物去扔匕首和投枪了，而是具有那么一大批觉醒者在掬尽忠贞，去腐生新，这就是新时期杂文有突破的多元化趋势。
    谭：您所说的多元化趋势是否还不仅仅指杂文队伍的多元化，还包括其它方面的多元化？
    唐：是的，我所说的多元化包括三个方面：一是作者队伍的多元化，杂文作者不像３０年代只是亭子间里那几个人，而今有诗人、小说家、报告文学作家、学者、自然科学工作者，有峨冠，也有布衣，这从人民日报“风华”杂文征文可见；二是思想内容的多元化，只要是社会生活中不合理的现象，都是杂文的题材，这与鲁迅当年集中在政治文化的论战方面不同；第三是文体样式的多元化，随笔式的，故事化的，以议论为主，讽刺的，阐释的，鞭挞的，异彩纷呈，不拘一格，煞是好看。
    谭：曾经流行过一种论调，认为鲁迅笔法是高压下的社会产物，现在时代变了，鲁迅笔法也随之过时了。所谓嵇康去了，广陵散就应该绝响。不知您对这种观点持什么态度？
    唐：这种观点由来已久，不是现在才提出来的，１９３９年—１９４０年孤岛文学时期就有过关于是否还需要“鲁迅风”的讨论。阿英认为鲁迅风已经过时了，巴人则认为鲁迅风并未过时，因为还有汉奸存在。阿英当时主办刊物《文献》，主要摘登解放区报刊的一些文章，有可能受解放区影响。
    谭：解放初期，冯雪峰发表《谈谈杂文》一文，批评黄裳复兴杂文的观点，宣布鲁迅笔法已经过时。
    唐：现在看来——不论是从社会发展的角度还是文学发展的角度——要取消鲁迅的笔法的观点是比较幼稚的，也是做不到的。人民内部就不可以讽刺批评了？我看到了共产主义社会也还需要它。何况我们国家封建历史很长，又是直接从封建社会跳入社会主义社会的，中间断裂了一个商品经济的发展阶段，就更有必要展开批评。
    谭：我觉得“风华”杂文征文的一位作者对这个问题说得很精采，有人要求新社会的杂文要同鲁迅的匕首和投枪划清界限，他问：新旧社会的贪官污吏有何区别？
    唐：我也注意到了。撇开这一点不论，我认为取消鲁迅笔法于逻辑常识上也讲不通，资本主义社会，报纸可以指责总统，社会主义比资本主义优越得多，是理应享有的政治民主和创作自由。封建社会皇帝还专门设有谏议大夫哩！我想，社会能容忍杂文存在，这本身就是社会清明的表现。
