According to the Hunan Provincial High People's Court, from 1987 to 1988, Yueyang City experienced 38 incidents of surrounding, insulting, and assaulting court officers during law enforcement. A total of 138 court officers were insulted, surrounded, and assaulted, and 3 cars, 4 bicycles, and some office furniture were damaged. In the first half of last year, Huaihua Region saw 19 incidents of surrounding, insulting, and assaulting court officers, involving 362 people. A total of 83 court officers were insulted, and 2 were assaulted.

Why do court officers frequently face such attacks?

There are multiple reasons:

Some cadres and the masses do not know the law, do not understand the law, and do not fear the law. Some hold the erroneous belief that "if you don't make trouble, you will be at a disadvantage." On December 21 last year, when Xiangyin County Court publicly tried a case of intentional injury, after the court announced a 5-year prison sentence for the defendant, more than 200 relatives and fellow villagers of the defendant caused a commotion in the courtroom, surrounding more than 10 court officers and 5 procuratorial officers for over an hour.

Some cadres and the masses have severe feudal clan consciousness, do not distinguish right from wrong, disregard the law, and oppose any judgment that is not in favor of their clan. Most rural incidents of obstructing law enforcement are related to feudal clan consciousness. On June 24 last year, when Xiangyin County People's Court handled a divorce property dispute case in Saidou Township's Yongcheng Village, at the instigation of a relative of the male party, more than 100 people surrounded and insulted the court officers, obstructing the officers' use of the vehicle for over two hours.

In some places, party and government leaders or judicial organs have local protectionism, encouraging and exacerbating the trend of obstructing court officers' law enforcement. On March 10, 1987, when Yueyang City South District Court executed an economic dispute case in Shengli County, Hubei Province, more than 100 local villagers caused a commotion and fought with the execution personnel of Yueyang City South District Court, injuring 2 people. However, the regional and township leaders remained indifferent, tolerating and protecting the troublemakers.

To maintain the seriousness and authority of the law, the people's courts at various levels in Hunan Province, while doing a good job of educating officers to handle cases impartially and promptly investigating and dealing with incidents of insulting, surrounding, and assaulting court officers, appeal to party and government departments at all levels and all sectors of society to support the people's courts in independently exercising judicial power and to provide a good social environment for the people's courts to strictly enforce the law.

　　请支持法院干警执法
    本报记者  吴兴华
    据湖南省高级人民法院反映，１９８７年至１９８８年两年间，岳阳市共发生围攻、辱骂、殴打执法的法院干警事件３８起，１３８名法院干警遭到辱骂、围攻、殴打，并损坏３辆汽车、４辆自行车及部分办公桌椅。去年上半年，怀化地区发生围攻、辱骂、殴打法院干警的事件１９起，参与围攻的达３６２人，法院干警遭到辱骂的有８３人，遭到殴打的有２人。
    为什么法院干警屡遭围攻殴打？
    原因是多方面的：
    部分干部、群众不知法、不懂法、不畏法，有的存在“不闹就要吃亏”等错误思想。去年１２月２１日，湘阴县法院公开审判一故意伤害案，当法院宣布对被告判处５年有期徒刑后，参与旁听的２００余名被告的亲属及同乡哄闹法庭，将在场的１０多名法院干警和５名检察干警围攻１个多小时。
    部分干部、群众封建宗族观念严重，不分是非，抛开法律，凡是不利于我这一姓、我这一族的判决，就反对、闹事。农村发生的阻挠执法事件大多与封建宗族观念有关。去年６月２４日，湘阴县人民法院在赛头乡永成村处理一起离婚财产纠纷案时，在男方一亲戚的鼓动下，１００多名群众围攻、谩骂法院干警，阻挠干警用车２个多小时。
    有的地方党政领导或司法机关存在地方保护主义思想，放纵和助长了阻挠法院干警执法的歪风。１９８７年３月１０日，岳阳市南区法院在湖北省监利县执行一起经济纠纷案时，当地１００多名村民起哄、扭打岳阳市南区法院的执行人员，打伤２人，但地区、乡领导“事不关己、高高挂起”，纵容、袒护闹事者。
    为了维护法律的严肃性和权威性，湖南省各级人民法院在做好教育干警秉公办案和及时查处辱骂、围攻、殴打法院干警事件的同时，呼吁各级党政部门和社会各界支持人民法院独立行使审判权，为人民法院严格执法提供一个良好的社会环境。
