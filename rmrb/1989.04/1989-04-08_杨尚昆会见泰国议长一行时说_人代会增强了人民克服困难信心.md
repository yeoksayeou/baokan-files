State Chairman Yang Shangkun said this morning during a meeting with Thai guests, "Our country's overall situation is good, but there are also many difficulties. If we can mobilize the enthusiasm of the entire nation, these difficulties can be overcome. We have such confidence."

Yang Shangkun briefed the delegation led by Speaker of the Thai House of Representatives Bancha Kaewsangkhom on the recently concluded Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress. He said, "Premier Li Peng's report to the session both affirmed achievements and honestly informed the people of the current difficulties, including some errors in our decision-making. 'The report was well received.'"

He said, "The goal of this session is to 'mobilize all levels, with the entire nation working together to overcome current difficulties.' He added, 'After this session, it seems that there are ways to overcome difficulties, and the confidence of the people across the country has been strengthened.'

Yang Shangkun listed the current difficulties, such as agriculture, family planning, education, inflation, and price increases. He provided a more detailed explanation of the two issues of agriculture and family planning.

Yang Shangkun said, "We are now in a period of adjustment. Not only industry needs adjustment, but also agriculture, and all aspects of the relationship need adjustment." The NPC proposed to spend a few years living "tightly," not living "poorly," but rather everyone should save as much as possible, and some excessive consumption should be appropriately restricted.

Speaker Bancha congratulated the achievements of the Second Session of the Seventh NPC. He believed that Chinese leaders have the ability to lead the entire nation to overcome difficulties.

Yang Shangkun and Bancha also discussed the "very close" relationship between China and Thailand and between the peoples of the two countries.

Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the NPC Ye Fei participated in the meeting.

    据新华社北京４月７日电  （记者周慈朴）国家主席杨尚昆今天上午在会见泰国客人时说，“我国总的形势不错，但是困难也不少。如果把全国人民的积极性调动起来，困难能够克服。我们有这样的信心。”
