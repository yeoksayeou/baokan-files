United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat held talks today in Geneva. The two sides exchanged views on convening an international peace conference for the Middle East and Israel's recent proposal to hold elections in the occupied territories.

The talks were held at Arafat's request. Local sources believe this is part of the PLO and the Palestinian state's efforts to gain broader international support.

The talks lasted one and a half hours. After the meeting, Arafat told reporters that an international peace conference for the Middle East could possibly be held this year.

Arafat reiterated his rejection of Israeli Prime Minister Shamir's proposal earlier this month in Washington to hold elections in the occupied territories. He emphasized that democracy must be linked with freedom, and that the proposal to hold elections under Israeli occupation is unacceptable. He pointed out that only after Israel withdraws from the occupied territories will the PLO agree to hold elections under United Nations supervision.

Regarding the Palestinian state's demand to join the World Health Organization, Arafat said that despite strong opposition from the United States, he will continue to make unremitting efforts to make the Palestinian state a formal member of the World Health Organization.

He said, "We hope that the PLO and the Palestinian state will participate in all activities of the United Nations, and we absolutely have this right."

　　德奎利亚尔　阿拉法特举行会谈  讨论中东和平进程
    新华社日内瓦４月２０日电（记者李锐锋）联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔与巴勒斯坦国总统阿拉法特今天下午在这里举行了会谈，双方就召开中东国际和平会议和以色列最近提出的在被占领土举行选举的新建议等问题交换了意见。
    这次会谈是应阿拉法特的要求举行的。此间人士认为，这是巴解组织和巴勒斯坦国为争取更广泛的国际支持所作努力的一部分。
    今天的会谈共进行了一个半小时。会谈后，阿拉法特对记者们表示，中东和平会议有可能在今年内举行。
    阿拉法特重申拒绝以色列总理沙米尔本月早些时候在华盛顿提出的在被占领土举行选举的建议。他强调，民主必须与自由相联系，在以色列占领下进行选举的建议是不能接受的。他指出，只有在以色列撤出被占领土后，巴解组织才会同意举行由联合国监督的选举。
    阿拉法特在谈到巴勒斯坦国要求加入世界卫生组织问题时说，尽管美国强烈反对，他仍将进行不懈的努力，力争使巴勒斯坦国成为世界卫生组织的正式成员国。
    他说：“我们希望巴解组织和巴勒斯坦国参与联合国的一切活动，我们绝对拥有这一权利。”（附图片）
