Title: Asking Half-Slope Site

Yes, only fifty thousand square meters
A small village
Clouds and rain crowd together
The man's brutality
The woman's tenderness
Is this a world?
Only fifty thousand square meters
But it can hold a nation's blood
It can contain so much shame and glory
Did the ancient times have wars?
Did the ancestors often pray for peace?
Warriors who grew up on meat
Did not become bestial
Stone spears and bamboo arrows are the ancestors of weapons
They are also the stars of survival wisdom
From which bloody day to start
To kill the clever with cleverness?
Those meticulously carved on the edge of pottery
Simple repetitive and yet regular patterns
Are they symbols of records?
The earliest human writing
Is it recording a slogan?
Is it recording a profound debate?
Perhaps it is a struggle with nature?
Perhaps it is a sincere sacrifice to the gods?
Maybe it is a lesson carved for future generations?
Step by step
An ancient tribe
Carries too heavy a burden
Struggles and struggles
Finally stops at "Half-Slope"
A lamp of the ages
Hangs obliquely in the middle of history
Is it to illuminate the later generations?
Or is it to adorn its own glory?
Ah! Those who come with nostalgia for the past
Can you hear
That six-thousand-year-old voice?

　　问半坡遗址
　　高深
    是的，只有五万平方米
    一个小小的村落
    云和雨拥挤在一起
    男人的蛮横
    女人的多情
    这就是一个世界吗？
    只有五万平方米了
    可铺得下一个民族的血迹
    可容得下那么多耻辱和光荣
    远古有没有战争
    祖先也常常祈祷和平？
    食兽肉长大的勇士
    并没有染上兽性
    石矛竹箭是武器的祖宗
    也是生存的智慧之星
    从哪一个流血的日子算起
    以聪明枪杀聪明？
    那些精心刻在陶器边沿的
    单纯重复而又有规律的花纹
    是不是记事的符号
    人类最初的文字
    记载的是一个口号吗？
    记载的是一次意义深远的辩论？
    或许是一场同大自然的搏斗？
    或许是一次虔诚的祭神？
    也许是为子孙后代刻下的
    教训？！
    一步一步
    一个太古老的民族
    背负也太沉重
    艰难地跋涉跋涉
    终于停留在“半坡”
    一盏岁月的灯
    斜挂在历史的中途
    是照耀后来者
    还是给自己镶嵌的光荣
    啊！带着怀古幽思而来的人们
    你可听见了
    那个六千年的声音？……
