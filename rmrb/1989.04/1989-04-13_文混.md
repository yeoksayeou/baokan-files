Title: The Literary Charlatan

The novel "The Scholars" (《儒林外史》) portrays many ancient "literary charlatans": the bachelors Jing Lanjiang and Zhi Jianfeng, the con artists Yang Zhizhong, Quan Wuyong, Zhao Xuezhai, and Niu Yupu, and the "princeling" Qi Gongsun, among others. Literary charlatans of ancient and modern times share many similarities. Among literary figures, there are inevitably "literary charlatans," just as in a market where officialdom is deformed, there are "official speculators."

The "literary charlatan" has a weak pen but a strong mouth, few works but many "brothers," and his main skill is to mix. He mixes fame, profit, official positions, male or female friends... Some "literary charlatans" actually mix quite well. Fake scholars have more fame than real scholars. Their mixing techniques include:

Mutual flattery—As long as one has been exposed a few times, shown his face a few times, and has a few lines of printed text, he is called a "new star," "elite," "unprecedented," "epoch-making," "master." Superlative descriptions, lively advertisements, one after another, writers without works, artists unrelated to art, are born in the mutual flattery. If someone doesn't understand the situation and says a word of truth: "That's not a dragon, it's a snake!" This is unacceptable. A group of snakes form a "dragon" and bite back, and the person telling the truth becomes a "snake."

Clinging to dragons and phoenixes—Whether real or fake, "X Old," "X Sister," "X Chief," it seems like they are old friends from his parents' generation, occasionally revealing some "inside information," passing on some "internal spirit," appearing mysterious and divine, as if the author and the work have a great background, even using so-called "instructions" to order newspapers and magazines to publish, as if there is a powerful background.

Blind fabrication—"Maotai" bottles filled with "Erguotou," magnets under the weighing scale, these tricks of the "speculators," the "literary charlatans" are also proficient in. Exposing the privacy of famous men, spreading rumors about famous women, treating vulgar and sentimental things as interesting, doing what decent people disdain to do, doing what the law does not allow, creating a sensation, shocking the universe, making money in any way possible. Among the "literary charlatans," there are not a few who have some talent. If they could calm down, take the right path, perhaps they could gain a place in the literary world. Unfortunately, that bit of talent, once mixed with vulgarity, officialdom, and thuggery, becomes foulness. Greatness produces excellent works. Foulness cannot produce good articles.

Being a "literary charlatan" is also a fashion. During the "Anti-Rightist" and "Cultural Revolution" periods, no one wanted to be associated with the word "literary." Now, some people are approaching "literary," which indicates that the literary world is moving from being unlucky to being respected. Just as the "literary thugs" in past political movements, "literary charlatans" are ultimately not literary figures. Literary people, beware of being used by "literary charlatans," so that the literary world will not be polluted by "literary charlatans."

### “文混”

　　“文混”
    《儒林外史》展出了许多古代的“文混”：光棍景兰江、支剑峰，骗子杨执中、权勿用、赵雪斋、牛玉圃，还有“高干子弟”蘧公孙，等等。古今文混一脉相承，文人中难免有“文混”，就像有官场发育畸形的市场就有“官倒”一样。
      “文混”笔头不硬嘴巴硬，作品不多“哥们”多，看家本事就是混。混名、混利、混官、混男朋友或女朋友……。有些“文混”还真混得不错，假牛布衣比真牛布衣名气还大。其混术有：
    互相吹捧——只要曝过几次光，露过几次脸，有那么几行印成铅字的文字，就是“新星”、“精英”、“空前”、“划时代”、“大师”。超级形容，热闹广告，一个个没有作品的“作家”、与艺术不沾边的“艺术家”，在你吹我捧中诞生了。如果哪位不识趣，要说句老实话：“那不是神龙是长虫！”这可不得了，一条条虫组成“龙”就咬了上来，说大实话的人反倒成“虫”了。
    攀龙附凤——“×老”、“×大姐”、“××首长”，不管真的假的，好像都是他父辈几十年的老交情，不时透点“小道消息”，传点
  “内部精神”，显得莫测高深，神乎其神，好像作者、作品很有来头，甚至拿着所谓“批示”，命令报刊刊登，似乎大有背景。
    瞎编滥造——“茅台”瓶子装“二锅头”，秤盘底下加吸铁石，这些“倒爷”的伎俩，“文混”也样样精通。揭名男士隐私，造名女人谣言，拿庸俗肉麻当有趣，正派人不屑为的他干，法律不准干的他干，爆破成名，轰动宇宙，怎么赚钱就怎么来。“文混”中不乏颇有点才气的，如果静下心来，路子走正，也许可以在文坛争得一席之地。可惜，那点才气一搅和进市侩气、官场气、棍棒气，也就成了秽气。浩气出佳构。秽气是出不了好文章的。
      “文混”也是一种时髦。“反右”、“文革”时期，没有谁愿意沾上那个“文”字，现在有人向“文”靠拢，这倒表明，文坛在由倒霉变得受尊重。如同过去政治运动中的“文痞”，“文混”终究不是文人。文人们，警惕被“文混”利用，这样文坛才不至于被“文混”所玷污。
