In a 6.5-hour match, Nie Weiping, who inhaled oxygen three times, was unable to defeat Cho Hunhyun, who smoked three packs of cigarettes, losing the first game of the first Applause Cup final by 3 points. The match began at 10 AM today and was held at the Shangri-La Hotel in Hangzhou, with a total of 255 moves. By the end of the game, both players had entered the reading time.

This was a closely contested match. Cho Hunhyun, known for his aggressive and sharp playing style, played with great confidence, unlike his slightly nervous demeanor when he first entered the competition hall. Cho Hunhyun chose to play white, leaving the burden of the eight-point compensation for black, as per the Applause Cup rules, to his opponent. Nie Weiping, playing black, tried to secure territory under this burden, but Cho Hunhyun did not yield an inch, responding accurately and not giving Nie any chance to win. According to the rules of mainland China and Japan, Nie Weiping lost by 1/4 of a point or half a point today.

Both sides started with a diagonal star formation. Nie Weiping, when his opponent did not respond to his low-hanging star position, adopted the ancient "double swallow" formation with some variations. Go master Wu Qingyuan praised Nie Weiping's use of this variation. When black played the 33rd move, extending it, and mistaking it for a preemptive move to test his opponent's response, Cho Hunhyun decisively broke away, seizing the crucial corner territory that determined the fate of both sides' pieces. Black had to start escaping the lonely piece and, under the burden of his own unsecured large piece, could not effectively break the large space formed by white. Most experts believe that black's 33rd move was the main cause of the unfavorable situation, but in this game, both sides did not make any significant mistakes. Cho Hunhyun, facing the renowned Nie Weiping, performed exceptionally well, proving with his outstanding performance that he has entered the world's top echelon.

During the match, black had an opportunity to create a ko fight and kill a large white piece, but Nie Weiping did not choose this move. Instead, on the 101st move, he stabbed to gain some territory. Similarly, white also had the opportunity to ko kill one corner of the opponent but did not take the risk. Instead, on the 88th move, he reluctantly attached. This may indicate that both sides were quite cautious in the first round of the final.

The second game between Nie and Cho will be held on the 28th, with Nie Weiping playing white.

　　应氏杯围棋决赛双方谨慎对弈    
    聂卫平第一盘棋告负
    本报杭州４月２５日电  记者温子建报道：在６个半小时的比赛中，吸了三次氧的聂卫平，未能战胜在此期间吸了三包烟的曹薰铉，以３点之差输掉了首届应氏杯决赛的第一盘棋。这盘棋今天上午１０点开始，在杭州香格里拉饭店举行，共行２５５手，结束时双方均已进入读秒。
    这是一盘势均力敌的比赛，素以棋艺刚硬、锐利著称的曹薰铉行棋显得信心十足，与他刚进入比赛大厅时略显紧张的情形截然不同。曹薰铉猜棋后选择了白棋，把按应氏规则黑棋需贴还八点的沉重负担留给了对手。执黑的聂卫平在这个负担下竭力捞取实地，但曹薰铉在左搜右刮的聂卫平面前一毛不拔，应对无误，未给聂以取胜的机会。按照中国大陆的规则和日本围棋规则，聂卫平今天输了１／４子或半目。
    双方以对角星位形势开局，聂卫平在对手没有应自己的星位低挂时，采取了“双飞燕”的古老定式并予以一定变化。观棋的围棋大师吴清源称赞了聂卫平对这一定式的变化运用。当黑棋第３３手长出，将之误以为先手试图观对手的应对时，曹薰铉果断脱先，抢占了事关双方两块棋安危的角地。黑棋不得不开始逃孤棋，并在自己这块未活净的大棋牵累下无法有效破除白棋借机形成的大空。多数行家认为，黑３３手棋是造成了己方不利局面的主要原因，但这盘棋双方都未出现大的失误，曹薰铉面对誉满棋坛的聂棋圣发挥得相当出色，以出色的表现证明了自己已进入世界超一流行列。
    对弈中，黑棋曾经有一个制造劫争劫杀大块白棋的机会，但聂卫平未选择这种走法，而是在１０１手点刺，获取了部分实地；同样，白棋也在可以劫杀对方一角的情况下，未去履险，反而委屈地于８８手粘上。这也许表明双方在决赛的第一个回合中都较为谨慎。
    聂、曹二人的第二盘棋将于２８日进行，聂卫平执白。
