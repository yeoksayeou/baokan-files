Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 25th.

	The CPSU Central Committee today held a plenary session, promoting 24 alternate members to full members of the Central Committee. At the same time, it approved the resignation requests of 110 retired Central Committee members, alternate members, and members of the Central Auditing Commission.

	According to TASS, CPSU General Secretary Gorbachev, in his report to the meeting, thanked the 110 Central Committee members, alternate members, and Central Auditing Commission members who had retired due to age or health reasons. He revealed that before the 19th Party Conference last year, there were calls to address this issue, but at that time, the focus was on solving the problem of deepening reforms. He said that now, the situation within the party and state organs has changed. Out of 301 Central Committee members, 83 have retired; out of 157 alternate members, 27 have retired; and out of 82 members of the Central Auditing Commission, 12 have reached retirement age. This means that out of the 540 members of the central organs, 122 have retired.

	Gorbachev emphasized that reforms often involve changes in personnel and the reconfiguration of forces within the party and society, especially when these individuals themselves request to retire.

	Among those who requested to retire from the Central Committee were former Politburo member and former Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet Gromyko, former alternate member of the Politburo Demichev, former Secretary of the Central Committee Dolgikh, former Commander-in-Chief of the Warsaw Pact Armed Forces Kulikov, and former Chief of the General Staff of the Soviet Army Ogarkov.

	Among the 24 who were promoted to full members of the Central Committee, notable figures include Farion, head of the International Department of the CPSU Central Committee, Velikhov and Koptyug, vice-presidents of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and Ivashko, second secretary of the Ukrainian Party Central Committee.

	Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 25th. CPSU Politburo member Medvedev said that today's plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee shows that the party is realistically and self-critically addressing its work and is determined to continue reforms more actively and effectively.

	At a press conference held after the plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee today, he pointed out that CPSU General Secretary Gorbachev's speech at the plenary session seriously, sharply, and frankly discussed the urgent political and practical problems facing the CPSU.

	Medvedev believes that the vast majority of Soviet people enthusiastically support reforms, but are dissatisfied with the process, methods, and especially the results of reforms in the economic and social welfare sectors.

	He revealed that speakers at the Central Committee plenary session frankly analyzed the economic situation of the Soviet Union, criticized the backwardness in meeting the urgent needs of the people, and believed that it is particularly necessary for the leadership to engage in dialogue with the masses to solve problems. At the same time, it was pointed out that the party's ideological work is in a backward and conservative situation.

	In response to questions about multi-partyism, he pointed out that socialism is not incompatible with the existence of several parties. At the same time, the one-party system under socialism will not limit democracy. The CPSU believes that multi-partyism is not suitable at present, but does not oppose discussing the issue of multi-partyism in the press.

　　苏共中央委员会大幅调整    
    百余名中委候补中委中检委退休辞职    
    梅德韦杰夫要求积极有效地进行改革
    新华社莫斯科４月２５日电  苏共中央今天举行全会，将２４名中央候补委员升为中央委员，同时还满足了１１０名已退休的中央委员、候补中委和中央检查委员会委员提出的辞职请求。
    据塔斯社报道，苏共中央总书记戈尔巴乔夫在会上作报告时，对上述１１０名由于年龄或健康原因退休的中央委员、候补中委和中央检委请求辞职表示感谢。他透露，去年召开党的第１９次代表会议前，就有人提出要解决此问题，但当时没这样做，而是让代表会议全力以赴地解决深化改革的问题。他说，现在，党内和国家机关内的形势发生了变化，３０１名中央委员中，８３人业已退休；１５７名候补中委中，退休者有２７人；８２名中央检委当中，也有１２人到了退休年龄，也就是说，在中央机构的５４０名成员中，１２２人已经退休。
    戈尔巴乔夫强调，改革往往伴随着干部的变动及党内和社会上力量的重新组合，更何况这些人是自己请求辞职的。
    在请求辞职的中央委员中，有前中央政治局委员、前最高苏维埃主席团主席葛罗米柯，前中央政治局候补委员杰米契夫，前中央书记多尔基赫，前华约武装部队总司令库利科夫和前苏军总参谋长奥加尔科夫等。
    在提升为中央委员的２４人中，较为著名的有苏共中央国际部长法林、苏联科学院副院长弗罗洛夫、韦利霍夫和科普秋格、乌克兰党中央第二书记伊瓦什科等。
    新华社莫斯科４月２５日电　苏共中央政治局委员梅德韦杰夫说，今天的苏共中央全会表明党现实而自我批评地对待自己的工作，决心更积极而有成效地继续进行改革。
    他在今天苏共中央全会结束后举行的记者招待会上指出，苏共中央总书记戈尔巴乔夫在全会上的讲话认真、尖锐而坦率地谈到苏共迫切的政治和实践问题。
    梅德韦杰夫认为，绝大多数苏联人热烈拥护改革，但对改革过程、方式方法，尤其是在经济和社会福利领域的改革结果感到不满。
    他透露，在中央全会上发言的人坦率地分析了苏联经济状况，批评在满足人民迫切需求方面的落后状况，认为，当前特别需要领导同群众对话切实解决问题。同时指出，党的思想工作处于落后、保守的局面。
    他在答复有关多党制的问题时指出，社会主义同几个党并存不矛盾，同时，社会主义制度下的一党制并不会限制民主。苏共认为目前多党制不宜，但并不反对在报刊上讨论多党制问题。
