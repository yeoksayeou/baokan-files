Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 24th.

The ninth "Feitian Award" for television series was announced in Beijing today.

The grand and meticulously produced "The Last Emperor" won the special award for television series. This series had the highest viewership among television programs last year. "Teacher's Soul" (Shi Hun), which has recently sparked significant discussion among viewers, won the first prize for television series. It sharply addresses educational issues, a hot topic that has stirred national thought and emotion. As television series are the "key projects" of various television stations, the competition was intense. In addition to "Pants Alley" (Kukou Xiang Fengliu Ji) and "Family Education" (Jia Jia) winning the second prize, and "Fence, Women, and Dogs" (Li Ba, Nuren He Gou) and "Green Shade" (Lv Ying) winning the third prize, this year's awards also included a nomination prize. Nominees for this year's awards include "Madame Plum Blossom" (Ping Mei Nushi), "Collision at the Century Gate" (Zhuang Ji Shiji Men), "The Five," "Yuan Chonghuan," "People of the Great Northwest" (Da Xibeiren), "Family, Spring, Autumn" (Jia Chun Qiu), and "Courtyard with a Backyard" (Dai Houyuan De Sihaiyuan).

In contrast, the creation of single-episode dramas last year was less impressive, with the first prize remaining vacant. "White Fence" (Bai Zhalan) and "White Mountain Ridge" (Bai Shigang) won the second prize, while "Pigeon" (Hua Gezi), "Mr. Wang's Marriage" (Wang Laoshi De Hunshi), "Tower" (Ta Pu), and "Han Family Daughter" (Han Jia Nv) won the third prize. "Good Father, Bad Father" (Hao Baba, Huai Baba), which is popular among children, won the first prize for children's television series with its charming innocence. Additionally, "Virus Gold Sunday" (Bingdu Jinpai Xingqiri) won the first prize for children's single-episode drama, and "Seventeen Moments of Spring" (Chuntian De 17 Ge Shunjian) won the first prize for dubbed films. However, the first prize for short dramas, sketches, and opera films remained vacant.

Today, the individual awards for the "Feitian Award" were also announced. The screenwriters of "Teacher's Soul" and "Good Father, Bad Father," Zhu Ge Yi, and the screenwriter of "The Last Emperor," Wang Shuyuan, won the outstanding screenwriter award. The outstanding director award was won by Feng Xiaoning, the director of "Virus Gold Sunday." The outstanding male lead, outstanding supporting male actor, and outstanding supporting female actress were awarded to Chen Daoming, Niu Xingli, and Gu Yan, respectively. The outstanding female lead award remained vacant. The outstanding cinematography, lighting, and art direction awards went to Xie Ping, Hu Ping, and the crew of "The Last Emperor," respectively.

The "Feitian Award" is authorized by the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television and organized by the China Television Art Committee and the China Radio and Television Society. Its purpose is to select the outstanding television series of each year. It is reported that the award ceremony will be held soon in another city.

　　电视剧“飞天奖”评选揭晓    
    《末代皇帝》获连续剧特别奖
    优秀男主角陈道明优秀女主角出现空缺
    新华社北京４月２４日电（记者秦杰）第九届全国电视剧“飞天奖”评选今天在京揭晓。
    规模宏大、制作精细的《末代皇帝》荣膺连续剧特别奖。这部连续剧在去年的电视剧目中收视率最高。近来在观众中引起较大反响的《师魂》获连续剧一等奖，它敏锐地触及到教育问题这一引起民族思考和情感波动的热点。由于连续剧是各电视台的“重点项目”，因而竞争较为激烈。除《裤裆巷风流记》、《家教》获二等奖、《篱笆、女人和狗》、《绿荫》获三等奖外，这届评选还增设了提名奖，获本届评选提名的有《评梅女士》、《撞击世纪之门》、《那五》、《袁崇焕》、《大西北人》、《家·春·秋》、《带后院的四合院》。
    相形之下，去年的单本剧的创作显得逊色，一等奖出现空缺。《白栅栏》、《白色山岗》获二等奖，《花鸽子》、《汪老师的婚事》、《塔铺》、《汉家女》获三等奖。颇受少年儿童喜爱的《好爸爸、坏爸爸》以其盎然天趣获儿童连续剧一等奖。此外，《病毒金牌星期天》获儿童单本剧一等奖，《春天的１７个瞬间》获译制片一等奖，而短剧小品，戏曲片一等奖则出现空缺。
    今天，“飞天奖”的各项单项奖也同时公布。《师魂》、《好爸爸、坏爸爸》的编剧诸葛怡，《末代皇帝》的编剧王树元获优秀编剧奖，优秀导演奖则被《病毒金牌星期天》的导演冯小宁摘取。优秀男主角、优秀男配角、优秀女配角得主分别为陈道明、牛星丽、顾艳，优秀女主角奖出现空缺。优秀摄像、优秀照明、优秀美术获奖者为谢平、胡平和《末代皇帝》剧组。
    “飞天奖”由广播电影电视部授权中国电视艺术委员会和中国广播电视学会主办，旨在评选每一年度的优秀电视剧作品。据悉，颁奖仪式不久将在外地举行。
