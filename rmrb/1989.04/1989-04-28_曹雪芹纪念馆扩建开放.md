The Cao Xueqin Memorial Hall has officially reopened after an expansion.

The memorial hall is located at the foot of the Western Hills in Beijing, next to the Wofosi Temple, in the village of Qingbaiqi. Originally, it consisted of only a row of twelve rooms in the Qing dynasty style, primarily displaying artifacts to recreate the typical environment where the great writer spent his later years writing in Huangli Village. However, due to its small scale and limited content, it was not commensurate with Cao Xueqin's status as a world literary giant. In 1988, the Beijing Botanical Garden invested again, adding a 363-square-meter exhibition hall in the rear courtyard. Experts from the Capital Museum skillfully decorated it, using photographs and charts to outline the history of the Cao family's rise in Liaoyang, prosperity in the south, and decline in Beijing, as well as the era in which "Dream of the Red Chamber" was written.

Since the founding of the People's Republic, "Dream of the Red Chamber" has been published in millions of copies, making it one of the best-selling literary works. The Cao Xueqin Memorial Hall was officially completed in April 1984 in response to the strong demand from scholars of the novel. Since its opening, it has attracted a steady stream of visitors and has been highly praised by all sectors of society. Relevant parties are planning to combine its reopening with the Beijing Peach Blossom Festival, creating another new tourist attraction.

　　曹雪芹纪念馆扩建开放
    本报讯  记者刘霄报道：曹雪芹纪念馆经过扩建已经正式开放。
    纪念馆坐落在北京西山脚下，卧佛寺旁，正白旗村。原来只有一排十二间清代制式的房屋，以实物为主，再现了伟大作家晚年著书黄叶村的典型环境。因其规模小，内容单薄，与曹雪芹世界文学巨匠的地位和身份极不相称。一九八八年，北京市植物园再度投资，在后院加建三百六十三平方米的展室，由首都博物馆的专家巧加整饰，以照片、图表为主，勾勒出曹氏三代兴于辽阳，盛于江南，衰于北京的家族史以及《红楼梦》成书的时代景象。
    建国以来，《红楼梦》出版了几百万册，是发行量最多的文学作品之一。曹雪芹纪念馆是应红学家们的强烈要求于一九八四年四月正式落成的。开展以来，观众络绎不绝，深受各界好评。有关方面准备把它的扩建开放与北京桃花节赏花会相配对，形成又一个新的旅游点。
