West German Foreign Minister Genscher tonight emphasized that Western allies must discuss the issue of holding negotiations on short-range missiles to find a "common position" on this matter.

Genscher expressed this view during an interview with West German Television Channel 2.

In his remarks, Genscher also firmly denied that West Germany's stance on short-range missile negotiations deviates from the NATO position. He said, "On the issue of short-range missiles, West Germany's position is the same as the 'decisions made by the allies in Reykjavik in 1987 and in Brussels in 1988.' He also pointed out that the European allies share the same stance as West Germany, all advocating negotiations to reduce short-range missiles.

Officials here believe that, on the eve of Genscher's and Defense Minister Stoltenberg's visit to the United States to report West Germany's position and proposals on short-range missiles, Genscher's remarks are clearly related to U.S. Secretary of Defense Cheney's statements today in Washington on the issue of short-range missiles. According to reports, Cheney expressed his refusal to hold negotiations on reducing European short-range missiles. He believes that since the Soviet Union has always advocated for the denuclearization of Europe, if negotiations on reducing short-range missiles are held now, there would be a "real danger."

It is believed that Genscher and Stoltenberg's negotiations in Washington will be challenging and difficult.

### 西德外长根舍要求  西方盟国讨论短导谈判问题

　　西德外长根舍要求    
    西方盟国讨论短导谈判问题
    新华社波恩４月２３日电（记者戴履斌）西德外交部长根舍今晚在这里发表谈话强调，西方盟国必须就举行短导问题谈判一事进行讨论，以便找到关于这一问题的“共同立场”。
    根舍是在接受西德电视二台记者采访时表示这一看法的。
    在谈话时，根舍还坚决否认西德关于短导问题谈判的主张与北约立场背离。他说，在短导问题上，西德的主张同“盟国１９８７年在雷克雅未克和１９８８年在布鲁塞尔作出的决定并无不同”。他还指出，欧洲盟国同西德主张是一样的，都赞成就削减短导进行谈判。
    这里的人士认为，在根舍即将同国防部长施托尔滕贝格赴美通报西德关于短导问题立场和主张的前夕，根舍发表上述讲话显然是同美国国防部长切尼今天在华盛顿所作的关于短导问题的谈话有关。据报道，切尼表示拒绝就削减欧洲短导问题进行谈判。他认为，由于苏联一直希望欧洲非核化，所以，如果现在就削减短导举行谈判，就会存在“一种真正的危险”。
    人们认为，根舍和施托尔滕贝格在华盛顿的谈判将是不轻松和十分艰难的。
