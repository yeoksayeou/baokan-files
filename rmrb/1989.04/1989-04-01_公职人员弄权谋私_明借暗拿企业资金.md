Recently, the credit and cash inspection team of our city investigated 35 enterprises in our city and found that 12 officials from the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, the Municipal Bureau of Building Materials, the Municipal People's Congress, the Municipal Archives, the Municipal Court, the Municipal Construction Commission, the Municipal Labor Bureau, the Municipal Price Bureau, and the Municipal Taxation Bureau forcibly borrowed 220,000 yuan in production funds from 8 enterprises. According to the enterprises' account books, the purposes of these loans were: 10 people buying houses, 1 person buying a color television, and 1 person using it for travel expenses. For example, the Municipal Construction Commission had an official who borrowed 10,000 yuan from the First Construction Company of Baocheng County in August 1986 to buy a house, without issuing a receipt, and had the enterprise list it as city construction management fees for settlement. An official from the Municipal Archives borrowed 25,671 yuan from the First Construction Company of our city in November 1987 to buy a house, and later had the enterprise list it as material fees for cost settlement. An official from the Organization Department of Yonghong District borrowed 5,000 yuan from the Second Construction Company of Jiamusi City in May 1988, and later the enterprise settled this amount under the entertainment expenses.

As of the time of writing this letter, except for two officials from the Municipal Price Bureau and the Municipal Taxation Bureau who have repaid the relevant units, the others have not yet repaid the loans.

　　公职人员弄权谋私  明借暗拿企业资金
    最近，我市信贷现金检查组调查了我市３５家企业，发现市工商局、市建材局、市人大、市档案馆、市法院、市建委、市劳动局、市物价局、市税务局等单位的１２名干部强行从８家企业借走生产资金２２万元。从企业的帐目记载看，这些人的借款用途是：１０人买房，１人买彩电，１人用作旅差费。如市建委，１名干部于１９８６年８月在宝清县第一建筑公司借款１万元用于买房，没有打借据，让企业以城建管理费列支核销。市档案馆１名干部于１９８７年１１月在市第一建筑公司借款２５６７１元用于买房，事后让企业以材料费名义列入成本核销。我市永红区组织部１名干部于１９８８年５月在佳木斯市永红第二建筑公司借款５０００元，事后企业将这笔钱在招待费中核销了。
    直到我写信时，除市物价局、市税务局两名干部已向有关单位还款外，其他人仍未退款。
