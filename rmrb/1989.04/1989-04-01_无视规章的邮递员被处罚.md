Edition: 6

Your newspaper published a letter from a reader on February 11th on the fifth page titled "Newspapers and Magazines Left on the Road, Compensation Still Required for Missed Issues," which accurately reflects the situation. Some mail carriers at the Yangping Post Office in our bureau do not adhere to regulations and are irresponsible with users' newspapers, magazines, and letters, often misdelivering or mishandling them. Our bureau has decided to stop issuing floating wages and bonuses to the relevant mail carriers starting from this year and to deduct their field allowances. Additionally, economic penalties will be imposed on the relevant responsible individuals and the director of the Yangping Post Office.

　　无视规章的邮递员被处罚
    你报２月１１日第五版刊登了《报刊搁置半道，缺期还要酬劳》的读者来信，情况基本属实。我局阳平邮电所个别投递员不遵守规章制度，对用户的报刊、信件不负责任，常常错分、乱投。我局决定从今年１月起，停发有关投递员的浮动工资和奖金，并扣减外勤津贴。同时，对有关负责人和阳平邮电所主任也给予一定的经济处罚。
