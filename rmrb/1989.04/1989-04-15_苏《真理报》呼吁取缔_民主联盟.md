Pravda today published an article exposing the illegal activities of the unofficial organization "Democratic Union," stating that such extremist organizations that seriously harm reform should be banned.

The "Democratic Union" was established in Moscow a year ago and has since spread to major cities like Leningrad. The organization claims to be a "political opponent of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union" and a "party against the authoritarian system." According to the content of its platform revealed in the newspaper, it holds a negative attitude towards Leninism, the October Revolution, and the socialist system.

In light of the increasing activities that endanger national security, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR recently issued an order to amend and supplement the criminal law on state crimes. According to this order, the ringleaders of the "Democratic Union" may face corresponding punishment.

　　苏《真理报》呼吁取缔“民主联盟”
    新华社莫斯科４月１４日电　《真理报》今天发表文章，揭露非正式组织“民主联盟”的不法活动，认为应取缔“民主联盟”这类严重危害改革的极端主义组织。
    “民主联盟”一年前成立于莫斯科，现在已发展到列宁格勒等大城市。该组织自称为“苏联共产党的政治对手”和“反对极权制度的党”。从报纸披露的该组织纲领的内容来看，它对列宁主义、十月革命和社会主义制度持否定态度。
    鉴于危害国家安全的活动日益增多，苏联最高苏维埃主席团日前颁布了修改和补充追究国事罪刑事责任的法令。根据该法令，“民主联盟”为首分子可能受到相应的惩处。
