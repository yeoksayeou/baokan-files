Some people in Beijing say: "Now it's easy to build a family, and it's also easy to break one up." Indeed, people's attitudes toward family are changing.

In the Sanlitun area of Beijing's Chaoyang District, a private entrepreneur had a grand wedding ceremony, but soon after, he divorced his wife hastily. From their first meeting to their divorce, less than half a year had passed.

The reporter learned that last year, Beijing courts handled 2,507 divorce cases, of which approximately two-thirds resulted in divorce, and nearly one-third were not granted divorce. Of the 5,585 divorce disputes mediated last year, 4,782 resulted in divorce, and 803 did not. From a formal perspective, the proportion of divorces by mutual agreement is higher than those decided by the court.

Professor Wu Changzhen of the Marriage Law Department at China University of Political Science and Law analyzed the reasons for divorce:

- According to a survey in Beijing, about 60% of divorce cases are initiated on the grounds of marital discord. Other reasons include:
- The spouse's inability to manage business and make money, leading to divorce;
- Divorce due to the spouse's bad habits such as drinking and gambling;
- Divorce initiated because the spouse is unfaithful, with money often serving as a condition for divorce;
- Divorce due to one spouse going abroad.

It is said that in the past, the main point of contention in divorce cases was property, but now it is mainly children and housing. Some even use children as a weapon to retaliate against the other party, depriving them of the right to visit or see the children.

Some insightful individuals believe that the increase in divorce cases reflects the pursuit of more genuine marital freedom, gender equality, and individual autonomy by the parties involved. However, the phenomenon of third-party intervention has shifted from being hidden to being more open, with cases even occurring where a third party assists in the divorce proceedings at the court.

　　一些北京人家庭观念发生变化
　　离婚原因趋于复杂　第三者插足公开化
    本报讯　记者毛磊报道：北京有人说：“现在建个家容易，拆个家也很容易。”的确，人们的家庭观念在发生变化。
    北京朝阳区三里屯一个体户，结婚时大讲排场，隆重非凡，没过多久又草率离婚，两人从认识、结婚到离婚还不满半年时间。
    记者了解到，北京市去年法院判决离婚案件有２５０７件，其中约有２／３的判决离婚，有近１／３的判决不准予离婚；去年调解的５５８５件离婚纠纷中，有４７８２件调解离婚，有８０３件调解不离；从形式上看，协议离婚的比例高于判决离婚。
    中国政法大学婚姻法学教授巫昌祯分析了离婚原因：
    ——据北京市调查，以夫妻感情不和为理由而提出离婚的约占全部离婚案件的６０％左右。其他为：
    ——对方经营无能，致富无门而提出离婚；
    ——因对方有酗酒、赌博等不良嗜好而提出离婚；
    ——因对方玩弄女性而提出离婚的，并以金钱作为是否离婚的附加条件；
    ——因出国而离婚。
    据说，过去离婚双方争议大的是财产，现在则主要是孩子、房子。有的甚至把孩子当成报复对方的一种武器，剥夺对方探视、看望的权利。
    有识之士认为，离婚案件突出表现了当事人追求更实在的婚姻自由和男女平等以及独立人格。但是，第三者插足现象已由以往的隐蔽转向公开，甚至出现第三者到法院帮助当事人离婚的事例。
