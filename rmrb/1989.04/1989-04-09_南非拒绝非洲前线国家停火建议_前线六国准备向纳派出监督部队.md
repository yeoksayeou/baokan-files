Xinhua News Agency, Windhoek, April 7th.

South Africa's Foreign Minister Pik Botha on the 7th rejected the proposal by frontline states for an immediate ceasefire in the northern combat zones of Namibia.

Pik Botha arrived in Windhoek on the same day to attend a meeting of the Joint Monitoring Commission on the peace plan for Southwest Africa and the independence of Namibia. It is expected that this meeting will formulate a peace plan to end the conflict in northern Namibia.

Botha insisted at a press conference that night that the fighters of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) must return to Angola and lay down their arms. Then they should enter Namibia through three checkpoints and proceed with the elections according to the procedures stipulated in the peace agreement signed by Angola, Cuba, and South Africa in December of last year.

The spokesperson for the Administrator of Namibia announced at the press conference that a curfew would be imposed in northern Namibia.

Xinhua News Agency, Dar es Salaam, April 7th.

Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere said on the 7th that, given the current emergency situation in Namibia, Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe—the six frontline states—are prepared to each send a battalion to Namibia to fill the vacuum created by the delay in the arrival of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group.

Nyerere, in a statement issued upon his return from a summit of frontline state leaders held in Luanda, said that if the United Nations Secretary-General accepts the frontline states' proposal, the frontline states are prepared to bear the full cost of these troops. He said the frontline states are awaiting the Secretary-General's response to this request. He stated, "We cannot guarantee that the Secretary-General will accept our request, but we are prepared to fill the vacuum."

He said the troops sent by the frontline states will operate under the leadership of the United Nations. Once the United Nations peacekeeping forces take control of the situation, these troops will withdraw from Namibia.

　　南非拒绝非洲前线国家停火建议  前线六国准备向纳派出监督部队
    新华社温得和克４月７日电  南非外长皮克·博塔７日拒绝了前线国家提出的在纳米比亚北部交战地区立即实现停火的建议。
    皮克·博塔是当天到达温得和克参加关于西南部非洲和平计划和纳米比亚独立的联合监督委员会会议的。预计这次会议将制定一项结束纳米比亚北部冲突的和平计划。
    博塔在当天晚上举行的记者招待会上坚持认为，西南非洲人民组织战士必须返回安哥拉和放下武器。然后他们应该在３个检查站进入纳米比亚，按照安哥拉、古巴和南非去年１２月签署的和平协议所规定的程序进行选举。
    纳米比亚行政长官的发言人在记者招待会上宣布，纳米比亚北部将实行宵禁。
    新华社达累斯萨拉姆４月７日电　坦桑尼亚总统姆维尼７日在这里说，根据纳米比亚目前的紧急形势，安哥拉、博茨瓦纳、莫桑比克、坦桑尼亚、赞比亚和津巴布韦６个前线国家准备各派一个营到纳米比亚，填补联合国过渡时期援助团不能及时到达造成的真空。
    姆维尼在出席了在罗安达举行的前线国家首脑会议回国后在这里发表的一项声明中说，如果联合国秘书长接受前线国家提出的上述要求，前线国家准备承担这些部队的全部费用。他说，前线国家正等待联合国秘书长对这一要求作出答复。他说：“我们不能保证秘书长将接受我们的要求，但是我们做好了填补真空的准备。”
    他说，前线国家派出的部队将在联合国的领导之下，联合国维持和平部队一旦到位控制了局势，这些部队就撤离纳米比亚。
