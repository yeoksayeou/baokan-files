Tianjin residents' savings have shown a significant rebound. Stable prices and improved services have contributed to a steady increase in savings over the past two months. As of the beginning of April, the total savings deposits in urban areas of Tianjin reached 53.99 billion yuan, an 8.4% increase from the beginning of the year.

Assisting the blind in filling out forms, prioritizing savings for mothers with children, patiently counting and depositing 4,500 yuan in small change over four hours, spending days to find a winning saver to present a gold ring, a vice mayor's radio broadcast to address doubts and mobilize savings, organizing youth savings campaigns inspired by Lei Feng's spirit of patriotism... These efforts have significantly boosted Tianjin residents' enthusiasm for saving.

　　天津居民储蓄回升
    本报天津四月十九日电　物价趋平和改进服务，使天津市两个月来一直保持良好的储蓄势头。截至四月上旬，全市城镇存款余额达五十三点九九亿元，比年初增长百分之八点四。
    帮盲人填单据，为孩子妈妈先存取，耐心花四小时点存四千五百元的角票，用几天时间寻到中奖储户送上金戒指，副市长作释疑解惑的储蓄动员广播谈话，举办青少年学雷锋爱国储蓄……这些，都使天津居民储蓄的积极性显著提高。
