    A Cry to Society
    In early March, I witnessed a scene on the streets of Xinghua County, Jiangsu Province, that left me deeply moved. During the Spring Festival, these children received some lucky money. After playing with firecrackers, they might have secretly imitated adults shouting "four, five, six," and over time, they became addicted, to the point where they now shamelessly squat on the side of the road, throwing "one, two, three," with the stakes getting higher and higher. If you don't believe it, look at the 10-yuan bills under the children's feet.

    I appeal to parents and adults: during the Spring Festival, it is not advisable to give children too much lucky money. In daily life, you should also control their pocket money, so as not to let children fall into the quagmire of gambling from a young age. Adults should also be mindful and not indulge in gambling activities during their leisure time, even if it is just a small game of "little come and go." We must set a good example for the children. I hereby publish this photo as a cry to society!

    向社会呐喊
    3月上旬，我在江苏省响水县街头见此情景，感慨万端。春节期间，这些孩子得到一些压岁钱，在玩炮仗之余，也许曾偷偷模仿大人吆喝“四五六”，久之上瘾，以至发展到现在这样毫无顾忌地蹲在路边掷起“幺二三”来，赌注也越下越大。不信，请看孩子们脚下踩着的都是10元大钞。
    有望于家长、大人们，春节不宜给孩子们过多的压岁钱，平时给他们零星花费也应有所节制，不要让孩子从小就堕入赌博的泥潭里。大人也应检点，闲暇时不要沉溺于一赌输赢的活动之中，哪怕是所谓的“小来来”。要为孩子们树一个良好的榜样。谨以此照片，向社会呐喊！
