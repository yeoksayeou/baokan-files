    Beijing Hosts Bird-Loving Week Consultation Activity
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 2nd

    What if the forests were all cut down, and the wild animals were all hunted? What if all freshwater resources were polluted? The Earth cannot be left with only humans! In conjunction with the implementation of the "Wildlife Protection Law" starting March 1st, a "Bird-Loving Week" publicity and consultation activity aimed at raising public awareness of wildlife protection began today in Beijing. Eleven publicity points were set up in Zhongshan Park, Tuanjiehu Park, Huairou, and other locations, using consultation, distribution of materials, illustrations, and prize-winning quizzes to promote wildlife protection knowledge. This activity is organized by the Chinese Wildlife Conservation Association, Beijing Middle School Biology Enthusiasts Association, and the Biology Department of Beijing Normal University.
