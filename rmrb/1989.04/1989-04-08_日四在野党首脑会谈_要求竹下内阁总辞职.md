People's Daily, Tokyo, April 7th. Reporter Yu Qing reports: The leaders of the four opposition parties in Japan—the Japan Socialist Party, Komeito, Democratic Socialist Party, and the Social Democratic Federation—held a meeting in Kyoto today to discuss the current political situation. They unanimously demanded that the Bunsho Cabinet resign, dissolve the House of Representatives, and hold a general election. They also reached a consensus on forming a "United Government Council."

The background to the joint action by the opposition parties is the widespread public dissatisfaction with the Recruit stock scandal and the implementation of the consumption tax, which has caused the cabinet's support rate to drop to an all-time low. On the issue of whether to question former Prime Minister Nakasone, the opposition parties and the Liberal Democratic Party have differing opinions, leading to a stalemate in the Diet, and the budget for this year has not been passed. In recent days, it has been revealed that Bunsho, while serving as the Minister of Finance and the Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party, also had connections with Recruit Company. The focus of public opinion has shifted to the cabinet members in power. Major factions within the Liberal Democratic Party have shown signs of disintegration, and the "mainstream system" has cracks. Local organizations of the Liberal Democratic Party have also called for the resignation of the cabinet. The political situation in Japan has become even more turbulent.

　　日四在野党首脑会谈  要求竹下内阁总辞职
    本报东京４月７日电  记者于青报道：日本社会党、公明党、民社党和社民联四个在野党首脑，今天在京都就当前政局举行会谈。一致要求竹下内阁总辞职、解散众院、实行总选举，并就组成“联合政权协议会”取得一致看法。
    在野党联合行动的背景是，利库路特股票丑闻和实行消费税引起国民普遍不满，内阁支持率下降到历史最低点。在是否传问前首相中曾根的问题上，在野党和自民党意见相左，国会陷入停滞状态，本年度预算案迟迟不得通过。近日来，接连发现竹下在任藏相和自民党干事长期间，也与利库路特公司有瓜葛，舆论焦点已转向内阁当权者。自民党内主要派阀也有离心倾向，“总主流体制”出现龟裂。自民党地方组织也出现要求内阁总辞职的呼声。日本政局更加动荡。
