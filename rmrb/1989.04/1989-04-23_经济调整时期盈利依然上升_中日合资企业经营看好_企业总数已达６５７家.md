    The continuous improvement of China's investment environment has created favorable external conditions for the operation of Sino-foreign joint ventures. Among them, Sino-Japanese joint ventures have shown a clear trend of improvement in their operations, with increasing profits and growing foreign exchange earnings.

    The director of the Beijing Liaison Office of the Japan External Trade Organization, Imai Rizō, introduced a recent survey, stating that the survey of 176 Sino-Japanese joint ventures showed that despite the economic adjustment period in China, with shortages of raw materials and energy, 79.4% of the enterprises reported better operating conditions compared to the previous year. Enterprises that are profitable or breaking even reached 73.8%. In the fields of machinery and precision machinery, the number of profitable enterprises is on the rise. Additionally, the work of foreign exchange balance has achieved remarkable results, with enterprises that export all their products accounting for over 30% of the surveyed enterprises, and enterprises with an export product ratio of over 71% accounting for nearly half.

    The survey also revealed some concerns, such as difficulties in procuring raw materials, ensuring quality, frequent power outages, high electricity costs, some Chinese management personnel having outdated ideas and not being good at cooperating in operations, and some places having outdated telephone and fax equipment, making it difficult to normally transmit relevant information and data.

    Sino-Japanese joint ventures have developed rapidly in recent years, reaching a cumulative total of 657 enterprises by the end of last year. Last year alone, 238 new ventures were signed, with an investment of $515 million, making it the fastest year of development since China's opening up.

　　经济调整时期盈利依然上升    
    中日合资企业经营看好    
    企业总数已达６５７家
    本报讯  记者陆振华、冯霄报道：中国投资环境的不断改善，已为投产的中外合资企业创造了良好的外部条件。其中中日合资企业经营明显趋于好转，盈利增加，出口创汇能力日益扩大。
    日本贸易振兴会北京联络员事务所所长今井理之介绍最近的一次调查时说，对１７６家中日合资企业调查说明，尽管在中国经济调整时期，原材料、能源短缺，但７９．４％的企业经营情况比一年前好，盈利和收支平衡的企业达７３．８％，在机械、精密机械等中高技术领域，盈利企业已呈上升趋势。此外，外汇平衡工作成绩突出，产品全部出口企业占调查企业的３０％以上，出口产品比率占７１％以上的企业近一半。
    调查的企业喜中也有忧，如筹措原材料较困难，质量得不到保证；停电次数过多，电费偏高；有些中方管理人员思想观念较陈旧，在经营上不善于合作；一些地方电话传真设备较落后，难于正常传递有关资料和信息。
    中日合资企业近年来发展迅速，到去年底累计已达６５７家。仅去年签约的就有２３８家，投入资金５．１５亿美元，是我国开放以来发展最快的一年。
