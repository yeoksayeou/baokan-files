The family farms of over 100,000 workers in the Heilongjiang Reclamation Area have raised 214 million yuan for spring plowing. By April 15, the area had planted 8.67 million mu of spring wheat, completing 75% of the plan.

The Heilongjiang Reclamation Area, with 30 million mu of arable land, is one of China's major commercial grain bases. Due to the state's tightening of credit, the area's spring plowing loan quota this year is 60% less than last year. Additionally, the delayed return of grain sales and soybean export funds has made the situation even more dire. Under these circumstances, workers from various farms in the area have taken various measures to raise funds, striving for a bumper harvest this year. Many family farms have not only contributed their funds for compensating for poor harvests and part of their annual distribution, but have also withdrawn a large amount of personal savings from banks. Many families have postponed building new houses or buying household appliances, using the money originally intended for consumption to purchase production materials. According to incomplete statistics from early April, the self-raised production funds of family farms in the entire reclamation area account for 28.5% of the funds needed for the spring plowing stage.

　　黑龙江垦区家庭农场
　　自筹二亿元投入春耕
    据新华社哈尔滨４月１８日电　（记者王来喜）黑龙江垦区１０万多个职工家庭农场自筹资金２．１４亿元投入春耕生产。到４月１５日，垦区春小麦已播种８６７万亩，完成计划的７５％。
    拥有３０００万亩耕地的黑龙江垦区是我国重要的商品粮基地之一。由于国家紧缩银根，垦区今年春耕生产的贷款指标比去年减少６０％，加上卖粮款和出口大豆款迟迟返不回来，资金十分紧张。在这种形势下垦区各农场的职工们采取各种措施筹集资金，争取今年的农业丰收。许多职工家庭农场不仅拿出了以丰补歉基金和当年分配的一部分，还取出大量个人在银行的存款。不少家庭农场推迟盖新房、买家用电器，把原来准备用于消费的钱用来购买生产资料。据４月初不完全统计，全垦区家庭农场自筹的生产费约占春耕阶段所需资金的２８．５％。
