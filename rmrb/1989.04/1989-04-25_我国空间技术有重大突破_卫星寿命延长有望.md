China has made significant breakthroughs in space technology, with the prospect of extending the lifespan of satellites. According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Beijing on April 25 (reporter Xu Zhimin), it is learned from the China Academy of Space Technology that China has made new progress in extending the lifespan of satellites. The design lifespan of new-type communication satellites to be launched in the early 1990s is expected to reach 8 years. This plan has entered the design and development stage.

In recent years, China has made significant breakthroughs in the design and development of extending satellite lifespans and improving reliability. In areas such as communication relay, high-precision control, unified microwave telemetry and tracking, high-efficiency satellite power, satellite thermal design, electronic compatibility, and tolerance design, a number of new achievements have been made, some of which have reached international standards.

It is reported that the design lifespans of the first communication satellites launched by the United States and the Soviet Union were 1.5 years and 2 years, respectively. China's first communication satellite had a design lifespan of 3 years, but it actually worked for 4 years and 4 months. China's second communication satellite, launched in February 1986, has exceeded its design lifespan and is still continuing to transmit broadcast programs.

　　我国空间技术有重大突破    
    卫星寿命延长有望
    据新华社北京４月２５日电（记者许志敏）记者从中国空间技术研究院获悉：我国延长卫星寿命技术取得新的进展，将于９０年代初期发射的新型通信卫星设计寿命可望提高到８年。这项计划已进入设计研制阶段。
    我国近年在提高卫星寿命和可靠性的设计研制方面有较大突破，在通信转发、高精度控制、统一微波测控、高效卫星能源和卫星热设计、电子兼容性、容差设计等方面取得了一批新成果，有的已达到国际水平。
    据介绍，美国和苏联第一颗通信卫星的设计寿命分别为１年半和２年，我国第一颗通信卫星设计寿命为３年，实际工作了４年零４个月。我国１９８６年２月发射的第２颗通信卫星，已超过设计寿命，至今仍在继续担负广播节目的传输任务。
