Yan Mingfu's Message to Young Friends:
Commit to Reform and Become Entrepreneurs

	BEIJING, April 28 (Xinhua) — Yan Mingfu, a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, said today at a symposium marking the 40th anniversary of the All-China Youth Federation that in this new historical period, the broad masses of young people should correctly understand the responsibilities bestowed by history, take up the torch of revolution, and strive for the future of the motherland.

	Yan Mingfu said in his speech that over the past 40 years, the All-China Youth Federation has played a significant role in uniting young people from all ethnic groups and sectors to advance socialist construction and has made positive contributions. He said, "Our generation of young people is destined not to be a generation of enjoyment but a generation of hardship, not a generation of joy but a generation of hard work and entrepreneurship. We must carry on the traditions of patriotism, democracy, and science from the May Fourth Movement and throw ourselves into the reform and opening-up."

	Liu Yandong, president of the All-China Youth Federation, said after introducing the 40-year history of the federation that the federation should continue to inspire the patriotic spirit among the broad masses of young people, making them aware of the patriotic sense of crisis, the sense of building the country, and the sense of striving for the country. She said the federation should guide young people, under the leadership of the Party, to take the task of revitalizing the country and enriching the people as their own, and become steadfast patriots, pragmatic reformers, hardworking entrepreneurs, and builders of socialist modern civilization.

	Former presidents of the federation, including Li Chang, Liu Daosheng, Wang Wei, Qian Liren, Wu Shaozu, and Shi Guangnan, also spoke at the meeting.
