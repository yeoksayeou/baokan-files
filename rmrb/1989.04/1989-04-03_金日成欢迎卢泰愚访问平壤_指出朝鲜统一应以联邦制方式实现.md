Kim Il-sung Welcomes Roh Tae-woo's Visit to Pyongyang,
Suggests Korean Unification Should Be Achieved Through a Federal System

	New China News Agency, Pyongyang, April 2 — Chairman Kim Il-sung of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea expressed his welcome for South Korean President Roh Tae-woo's visit to Pyongyang on April 1.

	This statement was made by Chairman Kim Il-sung during his visit to the residence of South Korean pastor Mun Ik-hwan, who was visiting Pyongyang. Chairman Kim Il-sung referred to Roh Tae-woo as "President," which is the first time he has done so.

	Chairman Kim Il-sung said that his suggestion in this year's New Year's address, inviting Roh Tae-woo, Chairman Kim Dae-jung of the Peace Democratic Party, Chairman Kim Young-sam of the Reunification Democratic Party, Chairman Kim Jong-pil of the Republican Party, and some democratic figures to visit Pyongyang to participate in a political consultation conference, remains valid. He said that they can come together or individually, and he welcomes them all.

	Chairman Kim Il-sung pointed out that the unification of Korea should be achieved through a federal system, and the federal state will become a completely independent, neutral, and non-aligned unified country.

	Kim Il-sung said that while easing the political and military confrontation and tension between the North and the South, issues such as family reunions for separated families, connecting railways between the North and the South, and jointly developing Mount Kumgang should also be addressed. Chairman Kim Il-sung had met with Mun Ik-hwan on March 27.

　　金日成欢迎卢泰愚访问平壤
    指出朝鲜统一应以联邦制方式实现
    新华社平壤４月２日电  朝鲜民主主义人民共和国主席金日成１日表示，欢迎南朝鲜总统卢泰愚访问平壤。
    这是金日成主席昨天到正在平壤访问的南朝鲜牧师文益焕住所回访时说这番话的。金日成主席称卢泰愚为“总统”，这还是首次。
    金日成主席说，他在今年新年贺词中邀请卢泰愚和平民党总裁金大中、统一民主党总裁金泳三、共和党总裁金钟泌以及一些民主人士访问平壤参加政治协商会议的建议，仍然有效。他说，他们可以一起来访，也可以单独来访，他都表示欢迎。
    金日成主席指出，朝鲜的统一应该以联邦制方式实现，联邦制国家将成为完全自主、中立和不结盟的统一国家。
    金日成说，在缓和北南政治、军事对峙和紧张状态的同时，也要解决离散家属互访、北南之间连接铁路、共同开发金刚山等经济、文化和人道主义的问题。金日成主席曾于３月２７日接见文益焕。
