Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, April 28th.

Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Chairman of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK), said today in Bangkok, “The Phnom Penh puppet regime is an illegal government that has not been recognized by the United Nations, and therefore it must be dissolved. After the dissolution of the Phnom Penh regime, elections should be held in Cambodia under the supervision of the United Nations, allowing the Cambodian people to choose their own government.” This statement was made in response to Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach’s remarks that “everything can be discussed, except for the dissolution of the People’s Republic of Kampuchea.”

Prince Sihanouk arrived in Bangkok this evening by plane from Beijing to begin his official visit to Thailand. Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila and Deputy Foreign Minister Bopit Amornvivat welcomed the delegation at the airport.

Also present at the airport to greet the delegation were Son Sann, Khieu Samphan, Son Sen, Prince Norodom Chakrapong, Prince Norodom Sirivudh, and Chinese Ambassador to Thailand Li Shizhun.

　　西哈努克说柬伪政权必须解散
    本报曼谷４月２８日电  记者刘爱成报道：民柬主席西哈努克亲王今天在这里说，“金边伪政权是没有得到联合国承认的非法政权，因此必须解散。金边政权解散之后，在联合国监督下在柬埔寨举行大选，由柬人民来选择自己的政府。”这是西哈努克对记者评论越南外长阮基石的讲话——“什么都可以谈，唯独解散柬埔寨人民共和国不可以”时说这番话的。
    西哈努克亲王是今晚由北京乘飞机抵达这里开始对泰国进行正式访问的。泰国外长西提、副外长巴博前来机场欢迎西哈努克一行。
    到机场迎接的还有宋双、乔森潘、宋成、拉那列王子、夏卡朋王子以及中国驻泰国大使李世淳等。
