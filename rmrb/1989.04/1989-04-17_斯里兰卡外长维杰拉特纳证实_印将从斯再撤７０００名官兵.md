Vijeratna said that these Indian troops are expected to complete their withdrawal by June.

After Sri Lankan President Premadasa was elected in November last year, he immediately demanded that India withdraw its troops from Sri Lanka. From January to February this year, India withdrew 3 battalions, approximately 5,000 personnel.

According to an agreement signed between India and Sri Lanka in July 1987, India had dispatched troops to Sri Lanka. Currently, there are over 50,000 Indian troops stationed in Sri Lanka.
