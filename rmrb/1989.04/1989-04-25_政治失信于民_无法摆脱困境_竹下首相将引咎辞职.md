Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 25th.  Reporter Yu Qing reports: Japanese Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru met with reporters at the Prime Minister's Official Residence this morning and said that the distrust of politics among the people, which began with the Recruit scandal, is still spreading. He deeply feels responsible for this and, as the highest official of the government and the president of the Liberal Democratic Party, expresses his deepest apologies to the people. He has decided to resign. He stated that after the National Diet passes the budget for this fiscal year, the cabinet will resign en masse. The scheduled visit to Southeast Asian countries on the 29th will proceed as planned.

Since the beginning of this year, the political situation in Japan has become increasingly unstable. It was within people's expectations that Takeshita would not be able to govern until the end of his term. However, his decision to resign so soon was indeed unexpected. Starting from mid-February, the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office successively arrested people suspected of involvement in the "Recruit case," including former high-ranking government officials. On April 1st, the consumption tax was implemented, causing dissatisfaction among the majority of people. The Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition parties in the National Diet have differing opinions on whether to summon former Prime Minister Nakasone, causing the budget for this fiscal year to be stuck in a stalemate. Recently, it was discovered that Takeshita himself had political funds related to Recruit Company, totaling approximately 200 million yen, making his situation even more difficult. Public opinion polls show that Takeshita's cabinet support rate has dropped to nearly 3%, the lowest in history.

Public opinion believes that Takeshita's decision to resign has at least two considerations. First, it aims to break the stalemate in the National Diet and pass the budget as soon as possible. Second, it aims to change the image of the Liberal Democratic Party's government being unclean, so as not to suffer a crushing defeat in the House of Councillors election.

After Takeshita announced his resignation, the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office stated that the investigation of the "Recruit case" will continue as usual and will not be affected by the prime minister's resignation. The opposition parties believe that Takeshita's resignation does not mean that the investigation of the "Recruit case" can be concluded, and they continue to demand that the National Diet summon former Prime Minister Nakasone. What attracts attention is that the focus of the political situation will now shift to who will take over from Takeshita and organize the transitional government until the end of autumn.

　　政治失信于民　无法摆脱困境    
    竹下首相将引咎辞职
    本报东京４月２５日电  记者于青报道：日本首相竹下登今天上午在首相官邸会见记者时说，以利库路特事件为发端，招致国民对政治的不信任仍在扩展，对此痛感负有责任，作为政府的最高负责人和自民党总裁，向国民深表歉意，并决意引退。他表示在国会通过本年度预算案后，内阁将总辞职。预定的２９日开始出访东南亚国家，仍如期进行。
    进入今年以来，日本政局愈趋动荡。竹下难以执政到任期届满，已在人们意料之中。但这样快地表示引退之意，确实出乎预想。２月中旬开始，东京地方检察当局接连逮捕涉嫌“利案”的人，其中包括前政府高官。４月１日开始实行消费税，引起大多数人不满。自民党和在野党在国会对是否传唤前首相中曾根的问题意见相左，使国会审议本年度预算陷入僵局。近期又不断发现竹下本人政治资金与利库路特公司有瓜葛，总数约２亿日元，使竹下处境更加难堪。舆论调查表明，竹下内阁支持率下降到近３％的历史最低点。
    舆论认为，竹下表示辞职至少有两个方面的考虑，其一是着眼于打开国会僵局，使预算案早日通过。其二是着眼于改变自民党政权不廉洁的形象，以便在参院选举中不至惨败。
    竹下表示辞职后，东京地方检察当局表示，追查“利案”将一如既往，不受首相辞职影响。在野党认为，竹下辞职并不意味追查“利案”可以告一段落，仍然继续要求国会传唤前首相中曾根。引人注目的是，政局焦点从此将转向由谁出马接替竹下，组织过渡到秋末的临时政权。
