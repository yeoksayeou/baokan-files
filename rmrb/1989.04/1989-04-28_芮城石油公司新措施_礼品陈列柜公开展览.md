Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, April 28th.

The business department of Ruicheng County Petroleum Company in Shanxi Province recently established a "gift display cabinet." Inside the cabinet are cash, premium cigarettes, premium liquor, and canned goods, with the names of the givers and their units clearly marked beneath each item. This is one of the measures taken by company manager Ma Sihua in the campaign for clean governance.

Ruicheng County Petroleum Company manages two major resources: oil and coal. Cigarettes, liquor, and "red envelopes" constantly surround manager Ma Sihua. To curb the endless stream of gift-giving and bribery, on April 17th, Ma Sihua issued a public announcement on the county radio station, explicitly stating that the company would stop all supplies to any unit that sends gifts and would publicly display the gifts in a "gift display cabinet," clearly marking the names of the givers and their units.

    新华社太原４月２８日电（通讯员任平军、姚研研）山西省芮城县石油公司业务室日前设立了“礼品陈列柜”，柜里摆着现金、名烟、名酒以及罐头等礼品，礼品下面都注明送礼者的单位和姓名。这是公司经理马思娃在廉政建设中采取的一条措施。
    芮城县石油公司管着石油、煤炭两大物资。烟酒、“红包”整天包围着经理马思娃。为了刹住这股无休无止的送礼行贿风，今年４月１７日马思娃在县广播电台发出拒礼公告，明确表示，对送礼者公司停止一切供应，并在单位设立“礼品陈列柜”公开展览，注明送礼者的单位和个人姓名。
