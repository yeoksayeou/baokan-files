Title: Opportunity

The coexistence and competition of the world order provide a great opportunity for China to accelerate economic development; China's ten years of reform and opening up have also provided a great opportunity for a generation of young people to showcase their talents.

Facing these opportunities, some young friends say, "Why not take advantage of this to make a quick profit!"

So, some take unpaid leave, go to Guangzhou, run to Shenzhen, and bring back T-shirts and jeans, truly making a quick profit. Some quit their jobs to go into business, hang up gold signboards on the street, and print business cards with "Global Company General Manager" on them, which is truly frightening. There are also those who start paper companies, buying and selling nothing, making money out of thin air. When someone reminds him to be careful about "getting caught," he just blows a smoke ring and says, "If they catch me, it's their bad luck; if they don't, it's my good luck!"

Some other young friends say, "Why not go abroad to make a quick profit!" Thus, the tide of going abroad surges, and people work hard to pass the TOEFL. Among them, there are indeed scholars who hope to return to the country after studying abroad, but in reality, it cannot be ruled out that there are some who go abroad to wash dishes and earn foreign money, hoping to earn back refrigerators, color TVs, and other big-ticket items as soon as possible, or even stay abroad and not return.

There is also a group of young friends who say, "The times are unclear, it's safest to be honest and steadfast!" They also know that seizing the opportunity to compete might make a big difference, but they worry about what will happen if they don't succeed. They hesitate, think too much, dare not compete, and let the opportunity slip away, content to remain mediocre.

More young friends, however, have built a stage according to their abilities and are rolling up their sleeves to give it their all.

I have a friend who lives in a remote village. He has no capital to start a business and lacks technology and raw materials to open a factory. But he does not give up. He scientifically cultivates vegetables on his two mu of contracted land, and as a result, he has become rich himself and has also developed a "vegetable specialty village," becoming a famous "vegetable champion"!

We should not only seize the opportunity but also, in the opportunities given by this era, use all our abilities and wisdom for the progress of society and the prosperity of the motherland, dare to pioneer, and be willing to contribute.

Although everyone's objective environment is different, as long as we have the spirit of the "vegetable champion," we can flip as high as the bed we have, contribute as much as our abilities allow, neither be content with mediocrity nor indulge in empty talk and unrealistic ambitions. Our youth will surely shine!

In this way, in a new century, ten or twenty years later, we will be able to say without shame: "We did not miss the opportunity! We did not let down the opportunity!"

　　机会
    侯明铎
    共存与竞争的世界格局，为我国加速经济发展提供了大好机会；我国十年开放改革，又为一代青年人一展才智提供了大好机会。
    面对机会，有些青年朋友说：“何不趁机捞一把！”
    于是，有的停薪留职，下广州，跑深圳，贩来Ｔ恤衫、牛仔裤，果真肥肥地捞了一把；有的弃工经商，临街挂起金字招牌，名片印着“环球公司总经理”，真是吓死人；也有的开起了皮包公司，买空卖空，无本生利，有人提醒他小心“进去”时，他却吐着烟圈说：“逮着了算他凶，逮不着算我凶！”
    又一些青年朋友说：“何不出去捞一把！”于是，出国潮滚滚涌动，考“托福”刻苦攻关。其中不乏求学者希望学成之后以报国门，但事实上也并不排除有那么一些人是到国外去端盘子赚洋钱，以早日挣回电冰箱、彩电几大件，或者干脆留在国外不回来了。
    也有一批青年朋友说：“现在的世道说不清，老老实实最安稳！”他们也知道在机会面前奋力一搏或许会成“大气候”，又担心成不了“气候”怎么办？而瞻前顾后，犹犹豫豫，左思右虑，不敢竞争，拱手把机会白白让出，甘愿流于平庸。
    更多的青年朋友，却是有多大的本事就搭出了多大的台子，甩开膀子干一场了。
    我有一个朋友，身居穷乡僻壤，经商没有本钱，开工厂缺技术和原料。但他不气馁，就在自己家的二亩责任田上科学种植蔬菜，结果自己发了财，还带出一个“蔬菜专业村”，成为一名闻名遐迩的“菜状元”！
    我们不仅要抓住机会，更要在这时代赋予的机会中，为社会的进步，祖国的昌盛，施展自己的全部才能和智慧，勇于开拓，乐于奉献。
    尽管各人所处的客观环境不同，但只要有“菜状元”的精神，有多大的垫子翻多大的跟头，有多大的才能作多大的贡献，既不甘愿沉沦，又不流于清谈、好高骛远，我们的青春又何愁不会放出光彩来？
    这样，十几二十年之后，在新的一个世纪里，我们就能够毫无愧色地说：“我们没有错过机会！我们没有愧对机会！”
