The New Industrial Structure of the Asia-Pacific Region
Shimin

Summary: Factors such as the appreciation of the yen have accelerated the adjustment of the industrial structure in the Asia-Pacific region, shifting the international division of labor from a predominantly vertical division to a horizontal one, forming a multi-tiered, dynamic, and catching-up type of international division of labor.

The Asia-Pacific region is currently the most economically vibrant and fastest-growing region in the world. In recent years, due to factors such as the significant depreciation of the U.S. dollar and the sharp appreciation of the yen, the industrial structure of this region has undergone rapid adjustments, leading to the formation of a new pattern of international division of labor.

Changes in Comparative Advantages Promote Industrial Structural Adjustments

In recent years, the significant depreciation of the U.S. dollar and the sharp appreciation of the yen have led to noticeable changes in the comparative advantages of different industries in various countries and regions. For instance, since 1985, the yen has appreciated by more than 85% against the U.S. dollar, causing a substantial increase in the price of Japanese exports and labor costs when calculated in U.S. dollars. The wage level, which was previously less than 60% of the U.S. level, has now risen to 92.2% of the U.S. level. Japan has largely lost its advantage of lower labor costs compared to the U.S. Currently, Japan's general labor-intensive and standardized technology products not only lack comparative advantages but also face threats from countries and regions with lower labor costs, such as the "Four Little Dragons" (South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong), in the international competition for the production of durable consumer goods (such as automobiles and household appliances) and technology-intensive products (computers, communication equipment, etc.) and their components and parts. As for the "Four Little Dragons," South Korea, due to currency appreciation and labor disputes, has seen a significant weakening of its comparative advantages in the production of textiles and footwear, and its competitive products are mainly capital-intensive. The ASEAN countries, on the other hand, have clear comparative advantages in textiles, footwear, and other products. With the changes in industrial comparative advantages, countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific are actively adjusting their industrial structures based on their own conditions. For example, Japan is now focusing on the development of knowledge-intensive industries and high-value-added capital and technology-intensive industries, gradually transferring lower-value-added capital and technology-intensive industries to the "Four Little Dragons" and ASEAN countries. The "Four Little Dragons" are focusing on the development of capital and technology-intensive products, gradually transferring general labor-intensive products to ASEAN countries. ASEAN countries, in addition to vigorously developing labor-intensive industries transferred from Japan and the "Four Little Dragons," are also accelerating the development of local resource-based capital-intensive industries to increase the proportion of industrial manufactured goods in exports.

Rapid Growth of Investment and Trade in the Asia-Pacific Region

The important prerequisite for the adjustment of the industrial structure and changes in the international division of labor in the Asia-Pacific region is the reorganization of input factors. Among the input factors of capital, technology, and labor, the most important is the transfer and rational allocation of capital. Japan has achieved the transfer of its industrial sectors by increasing direct investment in other countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific. Developing countries in the Asia-Pacific have also relied on large-scale foreign investment to establish new industrial sectors and upgrade their industrial structures. For example, in the fiscal year 1986, Japan's direct investment in the "Four Little Dragons" was $1.53 billion, an increase of 113% over the previous year, and in the fiscal year 1987, direct investment was $2.6 billion, an increase of 94% over 1986. Japan's investment in ASEAN countries in the first nine months of 1987 reached $817 million, nearly three times the amount of the same period in the previous year.

The "Four Little Dragons" have increased their foreign investment from Japan and the United States while also increasing their investment in ASEAN countries. For example, South Korea attracted $1.06 billion in foreign investment in 1987, nearly double the amount of the previous year, and invested $397 million overseas in the same year, an increase of 130% over the previous year.

In the past two years, due to the large trade surpluses of the "Four Little Dragons" with the United States, the United States has pressured the "Four Little Dragons" to appreciate their currencies, resulting in a reduction of the "Four Little Dragons'" trade surplus with the United States to approximately $31.7 billion in 1988. The slowdown in the growth of the "Four Little Dragons'" exports to the United States was mainly compensated by expanding exports to Japan, Western Europe, and other countries. Exports to Japan, which originally accounted for only 10% to 15% of the "Four Little Dragons'" total exports, were far lower than the proportion of exports to the United States (about 40%). In recent years, with the appreciation of the yen and the expansion of domestic demand, Japan's imports have rapidly increased. In 1988, the exports of the "Four Little Dragons" and ASEAN countries to Japan increased by more than 50%. The trade volume between the "Four Little Dragons" and ASEAN countries has also significantly increased. This reflects that the countries and regions in the Western Pacific have formed new international division of labor relationships through the expansion of foreign investment and trade.

Transition from Traditional Vertical Division of Labor to Horizontal Division of Labor

Since 1985, the production and exports of durable consumer goods such as household appliances and automobiles in the "Four Little Dragons" have significantly increased, and their international competitiveness has either caught up with or is catching up with Japan. Although their competitiveness in the production of machinery, electronic equipment, and precision instruments is still significantly behind Japan, it has improved compared to the past. In ASEAN countries, the competitiveness of light textiles and non-durable consumer goods and labor-intensive intermediate products (such as leather and wood products) has significantly strengthened, and in many aspects, it has caught up with and surpassed the "Four Little Dragons," and has also entered the production of certain high-tech products. This has led to the emergence of a dynamic, catching-up type of international division of labor in the Western Pacific region, with Japan as the first tier, the "Four Little Dragons" as the second tier, and ASEAN countries as the third tier.

Currently, the traditional vertical type of international division of labor still holds an important position in the Asia-Pacific region. However, between developed countries and developing countries and regions, especially between Japan and the "Four Little Dragons," there has already been a part of the horizontal division of labor within the same industry at the same technological level for different products. In many cases, Japan and the "Four Little Dragons" and ASEAN countries are engaged in the division of labor within the same industry sector at different technological levels, and even the same product at different technological requirements, in the front and back processes (such as design, processing, assembly, inspection, etc.). This division of labor has formally departed from the traditional vertical division of labor and is actually a new type of intra-sector (or enterprise) vertical division of labor. It can be said that the international division of labor in the Asia-Pacific region is gradually transitioning from a pattern dominated by traditional vertical division of labor to one dominated by horizontal division of labor.

　　亚太地区产业结构的新格局
　　史敏
    内容提要：日元升值等因素加速了亚太地区产业结构的调整，使这一地区的国际分工正由过去的以垂直分工为主向以水平分工为主转化，形成了一种多层次的追赶型的动态国际分工。
    亚太地区是当前世界上经济最活跃、增长速度最快的地区。近几年，由于日元升值等因素，这一地区产业结构加速调整，并在此基础上形成了国际分工的新格局。
    比较优势的变化促进产业结构的调整
    近年来，美元大幅度贬值，日元急剧升值，使各国（地区）不同产业的比较优势发生了明显变化。如日本，１９８５年以来日元对美元已升值８５％以上，使按美元计算的日本出口商品的价格和劳动力成本大幅上升，工资水平由原先相当于美国的不到６０％上升为目前相当于美国的９２．２％。日本已在很大程度上丧失了对美国的劳动力成本低廉的优势。现在日本一般劳动密集型和技术标准化的产品不仅没有比较优势，甚至连一些耐用消费品（如小汽车、家用电器）和技术密集型产品（计算机、通讯设备等）的零部件的元器件生产在国际竞争中也面临亚洲“四小”（南朝鲜、新加坡、我国台湾和香港地区）等劳动力成本较低的国家和地区的威胁。就亚洲“四小”来说，如南朝鲜由于货币升值及劳资纠纷的影响，现在生产纺织品和鞋类等一般劳动密集型产品的比较优势已明显削弱，有竞争力的主要是资本密集型产品。而东盟国家具有明显比较优势的主要是纺织品、鞋类等产品，随着产业比较优势的变化，亚太地区各国和地区都根据各自的条件积极调整产业结构。如日本现在着重发展知识密集型产业及高附加价值的资本和技术密集型产业，而将附加价值较低的资本和技术密集型产业逐步转移到亚洲“四小”及东盟国家。亚洲“四小”侧重发展资本和技术密集型产品，而将一般劳动密集型产品逐步向东盟国家转移。东盟国家除大力发展日本和“四小”转移出来的劳动密集型产业以外，亦将加速发展当地具有资源的资本密集产业，以提高工业制成品在出口中的比重。
    亚太地区间投资和贸易迅速增长
    亚太地区产业结构调整和国际分工变化的重要前提条件是投入要素的重新组合，而在资金、技术、人力诸投入要素中最重要的是资金的转移和合理配置。日本就是通过增加对亚太其他国家（地区）的直接投资来实现其产业部门的转移的，而亚太发展中国家也正是依靠大量引进外资，建立新的产业部门，实现其产业结构的升级的。如日本在１９８６年度对“四小”直接投资１５．３亿美元，比上年增加１．１３倍，１９８７年度直接投资２６亿美元，又比１９８６年度增加９４％。日本对东盟国家的投资在１９８７年头９个月达到８．１７亿美元，几乎是上年同期的３倍。
    亚洲“四小”在增加从日、美发达国家引进外资的同时，也增加了对东盟国家的投资。如南朝鲜在１９８７年吸收外资１０．６亿美元，比上年增加将近２倍，而同年在海外投资３．９７亿美元比上年增加１３０％。
    近两年，由于“四小”对美国的贸易出现大量顺差，美国便压“四小”的货币升值，这样，１９８８年“四小”对美贸易顺差降到大约３１７亿美元。“四小”对美出口增长的放慢主要靠扩大对日本、西欧等国的出口弥补。对日出口原来仅占“四小”全部出口的１０％—１５％，远远低于对美国的出口的比重（４０％左右）。近几年，随着日元的升值和内需的扩大，日本的进口迅速增长，１９８８年“四小”和东盟国家的对日出口以５０％以上的比率迅速增长。“四小”相互间及“四小”和东盟国家之间的贸易额也大为增加。这反映了西太平洋各国和地区之间通过扩大对外投资和贸易已经形成了新的国际分工关系。
    由传统的垂直分工向水平分工过渡
    １９８５年以来，亚洲“四小”的家用电器、汽车等耐用消费品的生产和出口大幅增长，其国际竞争力已经或正在赶上日本，生产机械和电子设备、精密仪器的竞争能力虽仍明显落后于日本，但也比过去增强了。而在东盟国家，轻纺类的非耐用消费品和劳动密集的中间产品（如皮革和木材制品）的竞争能力明显加强，在许多方面已赶上和超过“四小”，并已涉足某些高技术产品的制造，从而在西太平洋地区出现了以发达国家日本为第一层次，亚洲“四小”为第二层次和以东盟国家为第三层次的追赶型的动态国际分工。
    目前亚太地区传统的垂直型国际分工仍占有重要地位，但在发达国家与发展中国家和地区之间，尤其是日本与“四小”之间已出现一部分在相同产业中按同一技术层次的不同产品进行水平分工。在许多情况下，日本与“四小”及东盟国家之间是同一产业部门按不同的技术层次，甚至是同一产品按不同技术要求，在前后工序（如设计、加工、组装、检验等）之间进行分工。这种分工在形式上已脱离了传统的垂直分工，实际则属于新型的部门（或企业）内的垂直分工。可以说，目前亚太地区的国际分工正在由以传统的垂直分工为主向以水平分工为主的格局逐渐过渡。
