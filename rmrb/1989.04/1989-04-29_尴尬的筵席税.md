The Awkward Banquet Tax

	● In five months, only 750,000 yuan was collected
	● Common phenomenon: The tax collector and the taxpayer collude to evade taxes
	● Relevant officials propose: First, improve the collection method; second, strengthen inspections, and seriously investigate and handle public reports

	Liu Donghua, Xu Baojian

	In China, no one can accurately determine how much money is spent daily on dining in restaurants. Therefore, when we asked the relevant officials at the State Taxation Administration how much banquet tax should have been collected since its implementation, the official replied that among the various taxes currently being levied, only the banquet tax cannot be estimated. However, relevant departments estimate that from the implementation of the provisional regulations on the banquet tax on September 22, 1988, to the end of February 1989, the 750,000 yuan collected is likely much less than the actual amount that should have been collected.

	It is understood that in the fourth quarter of 1988, 11 provinces and cities across the country successively began levying the banquet tax, with a total tax revenue of 300,000 yuan. In the first quarter of this year, 8 more provinces and cities began levying the tax. In January, 19 provinces and cities collected a total of 170,000 yuan, and in February, 280,000 yuan. Wuhan, one of the earliest cities to levy the banquet tax, had estimated before the tax was implemented that the city could collect about 3 million yuan in tax revenue annually.

	Of course, the purpose of the state levying the banquet tax is not to increase fiscal revenue, but to "guide rational consumption and promote a frugal and thrifty social atmosphere." Therefore, if the 750,000 yuan in tax revenue indicates that the trend of extravagant banquets has been somewhat curbed, that would indeed be a piece of good news. However, as long as you visit restaurants, hotels, and banquet halls that act as agents for collecting the banquet tax, you will find that the reality is not as simple as that.

	Thus, various discussions about the banquet tax have emerged. Some say that the provisional regulations on the banquet tax still need to be improved and that complementary measures need to be implemented; others say that the hope of curbing extravagant banquets should not be placed solely on the banquet tax, but requires comprehensive social governance; some even believe that even if the banquet tax is collected in full, it will have no effect on curbing excessive consumption, because most of the expenses are covered by public funds, and individuals do not bear any personal cost; there are even those who doubt the necessity of this tax category.

	The banquet tax is in an awkward situation.

	The provisional regulations on the banquet tax have a total of 12 articles. The places implementing this regulation have also formulated implementation rules based on local conditions, and some have made additional regulations. For example, the regulation stipulates that the banquet tax is levied on a per-event basis at a rate of 15-20%, with a tax threshold of 200 to 500 yuan for a single banquet. The tax rate and threshold set by various places are: Shenyang, 400 yuan, 15%; Jiangsu, 400 yuan, 20%; Zhejiang, 500 yuan, 15%; Henan, 350 yuan, 15%. Since the tax collection does not consider the number of tables or people, some places have additional regulations that tax collection is required only if the per capita expenditure exceeds 50 yuan; some places also stipulate that funeral banquet taxes are exempt.

	Tax collection, of course, cannot be separated from tax authorities and taxpayers. However, in the process of collecting the banquet tax, an additional link has been added, which is "restaurants, hotels, guesthouses, reception halls, and other units and individuals engaged in the catering industry that handle banquets." They are the agents for collecting and remitting the banquet tax, that is, the agents. Perhaps, the relationship between the three is the crux of the problem.

	Undoubtedly, as agents, restaurants, hotels, etc., first consider their business revenue. The simplest logic is that without customers, there is no income; without extravagant banquets, there is no high income.

	The manager of the catering department of a hotel in Jiangxi complained to a reporter who went to interview him that the banquet tax had been levied for less than a month, and the catering department's business revenue had significantly decreased. Customers had all flowed to restaurants and hotels that did not levy the banquet tax.

	A restaurant in Wuhan, to attract customers, came up with a unique sign: "This restaurant bears 5% of the banquet tax."

	The most common practice is for the agent and the taxpayer to collude to evade taxes, such as using methods like splitting large amounts into smaller ones and issuing multiple invoices to deceive the tax authorities.

	As taxpayers, customers, in addition to colluding with the agents, also have legal loopholes to exploit, such as bringing their own cigarettes, alcohol, and fruits or purchasing them separately from the dishes, thus making the banquet payment amount not reach the taxable threshold and evading taxes.

	The banquet tax is collected by the catering service industry, but currently, it is very difficult to inspect the agents, and there are few regulations on rewards and punishments for the agents. In addition, the banquet tax is a tax with high difficulty and wide coverage, so many tax authorities also neglect inspections and supervision.

	It is understood that some provinces and cities that have not yet levied the banquet tax will also successively begin levying it in the near future. How to quickly plug the loopholes and ensure the implementation of the provisional regulations? Relevant officials at the State Taxation Administration believe that first, the banquet tax collection method should be improved, and each locality should formulate feasible implementation rules based on local conditions. For example, the implementation rules for the banquet tax in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region stipulate: "Agents should accept the management and supervision of the tax authorities. If the agent does not fulfill the collection obligation or engages in fraud and does not collect or undercollects the taxable amount, after verification, the agent is responsible for making up the payment, and the tax authorities will impose a fine of up to five times the taxable amount on the agent." To encourage agents to fulfill their collection obligations, it is also stipulated: "The tax authorities can deduct 10% of the collected banquet tax as collection management fees, which will be used to pay the agents' collection handling fees." If each locality can formulate corresponding measures and implement them in earnest, then the collection amount may increase significantly.

	Next, tax authorities should strengthen inspections and public reporting. Local tax departments should take this seriously, formulate measures, strengthen inspections, and crack down on tax evasion behaviors; at the same time, public reports should be seriously investigated and handled. The official from the State Taxation Administration introduced that a large restaurant in Wuhan had not collected a single yuan of banquet tax for more than three months since the tax was levied. The tax authorities, based on public reports, conducted a thorough inspection of the restaurant and found that the restaurant had 46 dining expenses that reached and exceeded the standard, with a total dining amount of over 100,000 yuan, and should have paid more than 10,000 yuan in taxes.

	Can the banquet tax get out of its awkward situation? People are watching.

　　尴尬的筵席税
    ●五个月只征收７５万元
    ●普遍现象：代征人与纳税人合伙逃税
    ●有关人士提出：一要完善征收办法；二要加强检查，认真调查和处理群众的举报
    刘东华　许宝健
    在中国，谁也难以说清每天用于在饭馆里吃喝的钱到底有多少，因此，当我们向国家税务局有关负责人询问，筵席税开征以来应该征收多少时，这位负责人回答，在目前开征的各类税种中，唯有筵席税预测不出。不过，有关部门估计，从去年９月２２日开始实施筵席税暂行条例到今年２月底为止，７５万元这个数字可能大大小于实际应该征收的数字。
    据了解，去年第４季度全国有１１个省、市相继开征了筵席税，税收总额为３０万元。今年第一季度又有８个省、市开征。１９个省、市１月份征收总额是１７万元，２月份２８万元。而最早开征筵席税的武汉市在开征前曾做过预测，该市一年能征收税款３００万元左右。
    当然，国家开征筵席税的目的不是为了增加财政收入，而是“为引导合理消费、提倡勤俭节约社会风尚。”因此，如果７５万元税款表明大吃大喝风已有所收敛的话，那可真是一个令人欣喜的信息。然而，只要到作为筵席税代征人的饭店、宾馆、酒楼等走一遭，你就会发现，事实并非如此。
    由此，产生了对筵席税的种种议论。有的说筵席税暂行条例还有待完善，要有配套措施跟上；有的说不能把抑制大吃大喝的希望寄托在筵席税上，而需要社会综合治理；还有的认为，即使筵席税能如实征收上来，也不会对遏制过度消费有任何作用，因为大多数是用公款吃喝，再用公款交税，个人不损毫毛；甚至也有人怀疑这个税种有无存在的必要。
    筵席税处于尴尬的境地。
    筵席税暂行条例一共１２条，实施这个条例的地方又结合本地实际制订了实施细则，有的还做了附加规定。如条例规定，筵席税按次从价计征，税率为１５—２０％，征税起点为，一次筵席支付金额人民币２００至５００元。沈阳各地制定的税率和起征点为４００元，税率１５％；江苏４００元，税率２０％；浙江５００元，税率１５％；河南３５０元，税率１５％。由于征收不论桌数和人数，因此有的地方附加规定要人均超过５０元才征收；还有的地方规定免交丧事筵席税。
    税收的执行当然离不开税务机构和纳税人，然而在筵席税的征收过程中却多了一道环节，这就是“承办筵席的饭店、酒店、宾馆、招待所以及其它经营饮食业的单位和个人”，他们为筵席税的代征代缴义务人，也就是代征人。也许，三者的关系正是问题的症结所在。
    无疑，作为代征人的酒家、宾馆等首先考虑的是自己的营业额。再简单不过的道理是，没有顾客就没有收入；没有大吃大喝，就没有高收入。
    江西宾馆餐饮部经理向前去采访的记者抱怨说，筵席税开征不到一个月，餐饮部营业额明显下降。顾客都流向不收筵席税的酒家、宾馆去了。
    武汉一家饭店为招徕顾客，别出心裁地挂出了这样的牌子：“本饭店承担筵席税５％。”
    最普遍的还是代征人与纳税人合伙逃税，如采用化整为零、多开发票等手段来欺骗税务机关。
    作为纳税人的顾客，除与代征人的默契之外，还有合法逃税的空子可钻，如烟酒、水果自带或与菜肴分买，从而使筵席支付金额达不到纳税起征点而逃避纳税。
    筵席税是由饮食服务业代征的，但目前对代征者的检查却非常困难，对代征者的奖罚也少有规定。再加上筵席税是一种难度大、涉及面广的税种，因而许多税务机关也疏于检查和监督。
    据了解，一些未开征筵席税的省、市也将在近期内陆续开征。如何尽快堵住漏洞，保证暂行条例的实施？国家税务局有关人士认为，首先应该完善筵席税征收办法，各地都要根据本地的实际情况制订切实可行的实施细则。如宁夏回族自治区的筵席税实施细则规定：“代征人应接受税务机关的管理和监督。由于代征人不履行代征义务或弄虚作假而不收或少收的应纳税款，经核实后，由代征人负责补缴，并由税务机关对代征人处以应纳税款５倍以下的罚款。”为鼓励代征人履行代征义务，还规定：“税务机关对代征的筵席税款，可按入库金额提取１０％的征收管理费，用于支付代征人的代征手续费”。如果各地都能制订相应措施并切实实行起来，那么征收金额也许会有大幅度提高。
    其次，要加强税务机关的检查和群众举报。各地税务部门应切实重视起来，制定措施，加强检查，打击偷漏税行为；同时，对群众的举报线索要认真调查和处理。国家税务局这位人士介绍说，武汉市有一家大饭店，筵席税开征３个多月分文未代征，税务部门根据群众举报，对该饭店进行了认真检查，发现这家饭店有４６笔就餐费用达到和超过标准，就餐金额１０万余元，应纳税１万多元。
    筵席税能否走出尴尬境地？人们拭目以待。
