Recently, I noticed that in front of several grain stores in our city, such as those on Changzheng Road, Shangdu Street, and Beihu, there were many grain speculators lurking. On the morning of March 6, I observed for about an hour at the grain store on Shangdu Street. I saw grain speculators purchasing rice from residents seven times, totaling over 200 kilograms. The transaction method was that residents bought rice from the store at 0.284 yuan per kilogram and then sold it to the speculators at 1.3 yuan per kilogram. This situation also occasionally occurs in some workers' dormitories. On the afternoon of March 6, I saw two grain speculators buying rice in the courtyard of a certain unit's workers' dormitory. Some speculators revealed that they buy and sell about 250 kilograms of residents' rations each day. These speculators then sell the purchased rice at a high price outside.

I appeal to the relevant departments to take measures to stop grain speculators from buying residents' rations.

　　粮贩子出新招　倒卖居民口粮
    日前，我发现我市长征路、上渡街、北湖等粮店门前，守候着不少粮贩子。3月6日上午，我在上渡街粮店观察了约1小时，粮贩子向居民套购大米竟有7起，成交200多公斤。双方交易的方式是，居民以每公斤0.284元的价格从粮店里买出大米，然后以每公斤1.3元的价格卖给粮贩子。这种情况在一些职工宿舍也时有发生。3月6日中午，我在某单位职工宿舍楼下，看见两个粮贩子在收购大米。有的粮贩子透露：他们每天每人购进卖出的居民口粮约250公斤。这些粮贩子将套购来的大米高价外销。
    呼吁有关部门采取措施，制止粮贩子套购居民口粮。
