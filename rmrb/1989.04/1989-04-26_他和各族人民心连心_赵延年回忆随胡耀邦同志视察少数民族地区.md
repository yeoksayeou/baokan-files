He is United in Heart with the People of All Ethnic Groups
— Zhao Yanni Remembers Accompanying Comrade Hu Yaobang on Inspection Tours of Minority Areas

Reporters: Shěn Chún, Yuán Jiàn Dá

After Comrade Yaobang passed away, on the third evening, CCTV broadcasted a documentary of his inspection tour in the Qinghai minority areas. Comrade Yaobang's image of tirelessly working among the people deeply moved the hearts of millions. As the former deputy director of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, Zhao Yanni, who accompanied Comrade Yaobang on multiple inspection tours of minority areas, still has vivid memories of those times.

Zhao Yanni said: "Comrade Yaobang paid great attention to the construction of minority areas and impoverished regions. In 1983, he went to Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai, and in 1986, he went to Qinghai. I was one of the accompanying personnel. On the trip to Qinghai, he was already 70 years old but did not spare himself from hardship. He consecutively inspected the Hai Bei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and revisited the Hai Dong region, Hai Xi Mongolian-Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and Hai Nan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. He visited Tibetan, Hui, Salar, and Tu ethnic groups' cadres and masses. At that time, the inland was in the midst of a scorching summer, but where Comrade Yaobang went, in the depths of the Qilian Mountains, was covered with snow. Like young people, he crossed the snow line at the Bingda Pass and entered the tents of minority groups, sitting knee-to-knee with the masses to understand their production and living conditions. In 1983, when he went to Qinghai, he first visited the Hai Nan Prefecture to see the Tibetan people and visited the workers building the Longyangxia Hydropower Station. On both trips to Qinghai, he insisted on going to the Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, which are over 4,000 meters above sea level, have inconvenient transportation, and face many difficulties. Despite the strong opposition from the accompanying comrades, he regretted not being able to realize this plan. Later, he invited the leaders of these two prefectures to Xining to listen to their detailed reports."

In the spring of 1986, Zhao Yanni also accompanied Comrade Yaobang on an inspection tour of the minority areas in Guizhou and Guangxi, spending the Spring Festival with the people. On these three trips with Comrade Yaobang, Zhao Yanni felt that he had met a good opportunity and a good teacher, and benefited greatly. He said: "The places we went to, Comrade Yaobang went to; some places we didn't go to, Comrade Yaobang also went to. He visited all 30 ethnic autonomous prefectures in the country, except for Yushu and Guoluo. In 1987, when we arrived in the valley between the Gaoligong Mountain and the Biluo Snow Mountain in Yunnan, the Lisu and Jingpo ethnic cadres and masses in the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture first told us, 'Comrade Hu Yaobang visited us during the Spring Festival in 1985!' In 1985 and 1986, Comrade Yaobang spent the Spring Festival in Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guizhou. During the Spring Festival of 1986, after arriving in Guizhou, he caught a cold and fever, but on New Year's Eve, he still insisted on visiting the homes of minority people and, despite his illness, visited the workers and foreign experts at the Tiancheng Bridge Hydropower Station under construction. He often said that leaders should go to the grassroots to spend the New Year with the people, especially in old, remote, poor, and border areas with the people. He himself took the lead in practicing what he preached!"

During the inspection tours in minority areas, Comrade Yaobang saw that the lives of some people were still difficult and their production methods were still backward, and his mood was very heavy. Zhao Yanni said: "He was genuinely moved. During the inspection, he often went straight into the homes and tents of the common people, or sat by the roadside, attracting a large group of locals to chat freely with them. The places he wanted to go were mostly not the 'model' places prepared in advance by others, but after listening to the local responsible persons' comprehensive introduction, he chose the places himself for on-the-spot investigations. When going to Qinghai, even young train attendants could not eat due to altitude sickness. Comrade Yaobang's altitude sickness was even more severe. Despite this, he still did not give up on investigation and research. His important speeches in Xining and Geermu were drafted under these conditions."

Zhao Yanni was deeply impressed by Comrade Yaobang's democratic style. He recalled: "During the inspection, Comrade Yaobang usually did not use manuscripts for his speeches. For important speeches, he would always discuss with the accompanying comrades, and after organizing them into a document, he would still send it to the staff for comments. Comrade Yaobang listened to others' opinions not just for show, but sincerely." Zhao Yanni recalled that Comrade Yaobang once said that the Guangxi and Ningxia Autonomous Regions could catch up with the national average development level ahead of time. Some comrades thought that Guangxi had a population of 40 million and a weak economic foundation, making it difficult to reach the middle level. Comrade Yaobang seriously listened to and considered this opinion. Later, at a meeting attended by the responsible comrades of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi, he said that to develop the economy, one must leverage advantages, but changing the sequence in the country is not an easy task. Comrade Yaobang once advocated the "Increase by 100" activity in Hebei and Yunnan. When others raised objections, he explained and supplemented, saying that if 100 yuan cannot be increased in one year, it can be done in two or three years, and one should set a current goal based on their own reality.

Comrade Yaobang highly respected and cared for the representatives of minority ethnic groups. Every time he arrived at a place, he would invite influential figures from all walks of life to come and have a friendly chat with them. Some people, for various reasons, no longer held leadership positions, but he would still inquire about their situations in detail. He said that representatives of minority ethnic groups who have made contributions, as long as they do not make serious mistakes, should be appropriately arranged.

Zhao Yanni was deeply moved by Comrade Yaobang's self-discipline and frugal style during the inspections. He said: "When going to provinces, autonomous regions, and prefectures, the matter of dining and reception has become a 'leader's headache.' Comrade Yaobang's requirements for himself in this regard are strict. He emphasized eating only local and ordinary food, not eating delicacies. Facing enthusiastic hospitality, especially in minority areas, Comrade Yaobang would persuade those who could be persuaded to be frugal, and for those who could not be persuaded, he would adopt the method of intentional avoidance. Sometimes, he would return to the train to eat a meal, and more often, he would eat a simple meal alone, not attending banquets or receptions."

Zhao Yanni said with emotion: "Comrade Yaobang devoted all his energy to work, and that spirit is moving. During the 1986 inspection of Qinghai, following the advice of Comrade Sima Yi Aimaidi and other members of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission Party Group, I wrote a report on the work of the new State Ethnic Affairs Commission team and the guiding ideology of ethnic work, and sent it to Comrade Yaobang. On the plane back to Beijing, Comrade Yaobang told me that he had read the report and had made important instructions on ethnic work. He repeatedly emphasized the need to prioritize economic work in ethnic work, strive for the common prosperity of all ethnic groups; emphasize starting from the reality of minority areas, and effectively implement reform and opening up; emphasize that the Han nationality cannot do without minority nationalities, and minority nationalities cannot do without the Han nationality, and Han and minority cadres should learn from each other, support each other, and seriously implement regional ethnic autonomy, consolidating and developing a new type of ethnic relationship of equality, mutual assistance, unity, and friendship; emphasize that handling ethnic issues is a major issue related to the fate of the Party and the country; ethnic cadres should play the role of advisors and assistants for the Party and the government in handling ethnic issues. All of the above have received the unanimous support of the Party Central Committee and the State Council leaders, pointing the way for doing a good job in ethnic work in the new era."

Comrade Yaobang was united in heart with the people of all ethnic groups, and the people of all ethnic groups will forever remember this sincere, honest, and great-hearted comrade!

　　他和各族人民心连心   
    ——赵延年回忆随胡耀邦同志视察少数民族地区
    本报记者  沈纯  袁建达
    耀邦同志逝世后，第三天的晚上，中央电视台播放了他视察青海少数民族地区的纪录片。耀邦同志不辞辛苦、深入群众的形象，打动了亿万观众的心。作为多次随耀邦同志视察少数民族地区的国家民委副主任赵延年，对当时情景更是记忆犹新。
    赵延年说：“耀邦同志非常关心少数民族地区和贫困地区的建设。他１９８３年去陕甘青、１９８６年去青海视察，我是随行人员之一。去青海那次，他已７０高龄，却不顾辛劳，连续视察了海北藏族自治州、黄南藏族自治州，并再次视察了海东地区和海西蒙古族藏族自治州、海南藏族自治州，看望了藏族、回族、撒拉族、土族等民族的干部和群众。当时，内地正值酷暑，而耀邦同志所到的祁连山深处却是冰雪铺地。他同年轻人一样，翻越位于雪线以上的冰达坂，走进少数民族的帐房，同群众促膝长谈，了解他们的生产生活情况。１９８３年去青海，他先到海南州访问藏族群众，看望正在修建龙羊峡水电站的职工。两次去青海，他都坚持要去海拔在４０００米以上、交通不便而又困难较多的果洛藏族自治州、玉树藏族自治州。在随行同志多方劝阻下，他才深感遗憾地没能实现这个计划。随后，他把这两州的领导干部请到西宁来，详细地听取了他们的汇报。”
    １９８６年春节前后，赵延年还随耀邦同志到贵州、广西少数民族地区视察，与群众一起过节。这三次与耀邦同志同行，赵延年深感得良机、遇良师，深受教益。他说：“我们去过的地方，耀邦同志去了；有些地方我们没去过，耀邦同志也去了，全国３０个民族自治州，除所说的玉树、果洛外，他都去过。１９８７年，我们来到云南高黎贡山和碧罗雪山之间的怒江峡谷时，怒江傈僳族自治州的傈僳族、景颇族的干部和群众首先告诉我们的是，‘胡耀邦同志１９８５年春节期间来看望过我们！’１９８５年和１９８６年春节，耀邦同志分别在云南、广西和贵州度过。１９８６年春节期间，他到贵州后就感冒发烧，但除夕还是坚持到少数民族的家中去过，还带病看望了正在建设中的天生桥水电站的职工和外国专家。他几次讲，领导干部应到基层与群众一起过年，尤其是到老少边穷地区与群众一起过节。他自己就率先身体力行！”
    在少数民族地区视察期间，耀邦同志看到一部分群众的生活还很苦，生产方式还很落后，心情十分沉重。赵延年说：“他确实动了感情。在视察期间，他往往自己一头钻进老百姓的房子和帐房里，或往路边一坐，招来一大群乡亲，无拘无束地与他们交谈。他要去看的地方，大多不是别人预先准备好的‘样板’，而是先听当地负责人全面介绍情况，然后自己选择地方作实地调查。去青海时，连年轻的列车员都多因高原反应吃不下饭。耀邦同志高原反应更大。尽管如此，他仍不肯放弃调查研究。他在西宁和格尔木的重要讲话，就是在这种情况下研究起草的。”
    赵延年对耀邦同志的民主作风印象很深。他回忆道：“耀邦同志在视察期间，平时讲话不用讲稿。重要的讲话总要与随行的同志商量，整理成文后，还总要再发给随员征求意见。耀邦同志听取别人的意见，绝不是摆样子，而是真心实意。”赵延年回忆，耀邦同志曾讲过广西、宁夏两个自治区可以提前赶上全国的平均发展水平。有的同志认为广西有４０００万人口，经济基础薄弱，要达到中等水平不容易。耀邦同志认真听取和考虑了这个意见。后来，他在云、贵、桂三省区负责同志参加的会议上说，要发挥优势，发展经济，但要改变在全国的序列可不是一件容易的事。耀邦同志曾在河北和云南等地提倡过“增百”活动，当别人提出意见时，他便作了解释和补充，说一年增不了百元，可以二年、三年，应从各自的实际出发，定个当前的奋斗目标。
    耀邦同志十分尊重和关心少数民族的代表人物。每到一个地方，他都要把那些在当地有影响的各界人士请来，与他们亲切交谈。有些人因种种原因不再担任领导职务了，他都要详细询问他们的情况。他说，少数民族中有贡献的代表人物，只要不犯大错误，都要适当安排。
    赵延年对耀邦同志在视察中严于律己、艰苦朴素的作风感触颇深。他说：“到省区和地州去，吃饭招待方面的事，已成为一种，‘首长的烦恼’。耀邦同志在这方面对自己的要求是严格的，强调只吃当地出产的平常的东西，不吃山珍海味。面对盛情接待，尤其是少数民族地区的盛情，耀邦同志能说服节俭的尽量说服，实在说服不了的，就采取有意回避的办法。有时，他返回火车上吃份饭，更多的时候是自己单独吃简便的饭，不出席会餐或宴请。”
    赵延年动情地说：“耀邦同志把全部精力都用到了工作上，那种精神令人感动。１９８６年视察青海期间，我遵照司马义·艾买提等民委党组同志的意见，把国家民委新班子的工作情况和民族工作的指导思想写成一篇报告，送给耀邦同志。在返回北京的飞机上，耀邦同志对我说，他已看了这份报告，并就民族工作作了重要指示。他多次强调要把经济工作放在民族工作的首位，致力于各民族的共同繁荣；强调要从少数民族地区的实际出发，切实抓好改革开放；强调汉族离不开少数民族，少数民族离不开汉族，汉族干部和少数民族干部要互相学习、互相支持，认真实行民族区域自治，巩固和发展平等、互助、团结、友爱的新型民族关系；强调处理好民族问题是关系到党和国家命运的重大问题；民族干部要发挥党和政府处理好民族问题的参谋和助手作用。以上这些，得到了党中央和国务院领导同志的一致支持，为做好新时期的民族工作指明了方向。”
    耀邦同志和各族人民心连心，各族人民将永远怀念这位热忱、坦诚、伟大的贴心人！
