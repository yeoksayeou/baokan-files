	Let Us Meet Again in Chiba
	Just moments ago, this place was like a volcano, erupting with passion and cheers. Now, it is eerily quiet. The grandest table tennis festival in history—the 40th World Table Tennis Championships—has concluded after 12 days of intense competition.

	Looking back at this tournament, one sees the vibrant development of table tennis. After the sport made its debut at last year's Olympics, a new wave of table tennis enthusiasm is rising. The number of athletes participating in this event broke the Gothenburg record, and even the German fans, who were previously only interested in football, began to pay attention to table tennis. Even the president of the International Olympic Committee, Juan Antonio Samaranch, was surprised, saying, "I have never seen table tennis being played in such a heated atmosphere." A batch of "small" table tennis nations is transitioning into "major" ones. The Soviet Union's Mazunov brothers are impressive, and the Federal Republic of Germany won a championship for the first time. The Soviet men's team defeated the South Korean team, and unknown newcomers defeating world-class players in the first round has become common. The International Table Tennis Federation has decided for the first time to hold the World Table Tennis Championships in Latin America...

	A more evident sign is the "complete collapse" of the Chinese men's team, which has won the world championship 10 times since 1961. The Swedish team coach, Oster, said, "The Great Wall of China has been breached." This "Great Wall" has indeed been "breached." Not to mention that the Swedish team has long since mastered the Chinese team, with Persson defeating four strong Chinese players, South Korea is no different. If the Soviet team had not defeated South Korea, China might have had to engage in a fierce battle with South Korea. China is the target of everyone's arrows, and the others are united as one, making the breach inevitable. Of course, we hope the Chinese team wins, and wins forever. However, when we think that the Chinese team's loss signifies the progress of table tennis, we should also feel happy. Without the Chinese team replacing the Japanese team in the 1960s, and without new forces coming to defeat the Chinese team, if it were always the case that near-table fast attacks dominated, table tennis would only decline.

	People will not forget the hospitality of the citizens of Dortmund. Among the volunteer service personnel, there were both middle school students and elderly people with white hair. They only received one meal a day, but who knows how many miles they ran each day and how much they talked; yet their smiles were always on their faces.

	People will also not forget the audience here. They cheered and sang for several minutes when the Federal Republic of Germany won the doubles championship, but they did not mock the losing teams. When playing the national anthems of other countries, they stood up straight, just like when playing their own national anthem. After the closing ceremony, athletes, reporters, and staff bid each other farewell with reluctance, looking forward to meeting again. Hands of different colors tightly clasped together. Let us meet again in Chiba, Japan, in two years!

### 让我们在千叶重逢

　　让我们在千叶重逢
    这里刚才还像火山一般喷发着热情和欢呼，此刻空旷得有些寂寥，有史以来最盛大的乒乓节日——第40届世乒赛在经过12天紧张激烈的竞赛之后降下了帷幕。
    回顾这次比赛，人们看到的是乒乓运动的蓬勃发展。去年奥运会首次设立乒乓项目以后，一股新的乒乓热潮在兴起。参加这次盛会的运动员之多打破哥德堡纪录，从来只迷足球的联邦德国观众也开始注意乒乓球了。连国际奥委会主席萨马兰奇都觉得吃惊，他说：“我还从来没有看见过乒乓球在这种热烈的气氛中比赛。”一批乒乓“小国”正向“大国”过渡，苏联的马祖诺夫兄弟等都令人刮目相看，联邦德国头一次捧走一项冠军，苏联男队击败了南朝鲜队，不见经传的新秀第一轮就打败世界名手屡见不鲜，国际乒联还第一次决定世乒赛在拉丁美洲举行……
    一个更为明显的证据是自1961年以来当过10次世界冠军的中国男队的“全军覆没”。瑞典队教练奥斯特说，“中国长城被突破了”。这道“长城”确实是被“突破”的，且不说瑞典队早就吃透了中国队，佩尔森一个人打败了4名中国强手，南朝鲜又何尝不是如此？如果不是苏联队打败南朝鲜队，中国很可能还要和南朝鲜队恶战一场。中国是众矢之的，人家是众志成城，突破有其必然性。我们当然希望中国队赢，永远赢下去，但是当我们想到，中国队的失利标志着乒乓球运动的进步时，也应该感到高兴。没有中国队在60年代取代日本队，没有新的力量再来战胜中国队，永远是近台快攻称雄，乒乓球只会衰落。
    人们不会忘记多特蒙德市民的照顾和接待。义务服务人员中既有中学生，也有白发苍苍的老人，他们每天只领一顿饭钱，可不晓得每天跑多少腿，费多少口舌；然而他们的微笑永远留在脸上。
    人们也不会忘记这里的观众，他们对联邦德国夺得双打冠军兴奋得欢呼歌唱长达好几分钟，但他们并不因此对失败的队伍加以嘲讽。演奏别国国歌他们同样全体起立，站得笔直，同演奏本国国歌没有什么不同。闭幕式结束后，运动员、记者和工作人员依依惜别，期待重逢。一双双肤色不同的手紧紧握在一起。让我们后年在日本千叶重逢！
