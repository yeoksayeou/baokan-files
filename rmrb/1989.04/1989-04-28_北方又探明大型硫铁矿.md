A large sulfur iron mine has been discovered in northern China. The Xinhua News Agency reported from Hohhot on April 28 that the Dongshengmiao sulfur iron mine in Inner Mongolia, the largest in northern China, has completed its exploration work, with a proven reserve of 2.89 billion tons.

The Dongshengmiao sulfur iron mine is located at the western end of the Yinshan Mountains and the southern side of the Wulate Grassland. Its total reserve is comparable to the current largest sulfur iron mine in China, the Dajiangping mine in Guangdong, and it also contains significant amounts of zinc, lead, copper, silver, gold, cobalt, and cadmium.
