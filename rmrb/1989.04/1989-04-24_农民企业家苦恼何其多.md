We conducted a survey of 48 outstanding farmer entrepreneurs in Hunan and found that these individuals, who have made significant contributions to the development of rural enterprises and agricultural products, still face immense difficulties in their entrepreneurial journey. Their hearts are filled with unspoken grievances, which have severely dampened their enthusiasm.

	•	Too many "mothers-in-law," making it hard for the factory director to be autonomous. These farmer entrepreneurs universally complain that when their enterprises face difficulties and production is sluggish, no one from above or below pays any attention. Once the factory revives and becomes profitable, "mothers-in-law" flock to it. Each sings a different tune, and there is no coordination among them. Those who should manage do not, and those who should not manage do. As a result, the enterprise is subject to too many interferences, and the factory director has no autonomy. One entrepreneur wrote: First, there is no personal authority; second, there is no financial authority; third, there is no property authority. Everything, big or small, must be approved by the township government leaders. Some township governments, without the enterprise's consent, force most of the retired village party branch secretaries to become deputy factory directors, turning the factory into a rest home. On the contrary, the factory has no authority to hire, recruit, or dismiss workers.

	•	Too many fees, making it hard for the enterprise to bear. Almost all the entrepreneurs surveyed have this complaint. In recent years, as enterprises have developed, various levies have increased rather than decreased. Requests for sponsorship, demands for support, and creative ways of collecting fees are endless. A company manager from Yueyang reflected that his company, which has not asked the state or higher authorities for a single cent in three years, has paid a total of 100,000 yuan in levies imposed from above in the past three years. Additionally, there are too many people coming to the company to ask for money and discounted goods, and to eat and drink.

	•	Policies not implemented, rights difficult to guarantee. The central government has long stipulated that newly established enterprises can be exempt from taxes for 1 to 3 years, but policies are policies, and executing departments do as they please. Some even mandate that employees with monthly wages exceeding 67.5 yuan must pay income tax.

	•	Everything requires asking for help, every day needs to burn incense. Financial tightness, shortage of raw materials, and energy scarcity are problems that constantly plague all the entrepreneurs surveyed. They reflect that township enterprises are like orphans, begging for food every day and facing cold shoulders. You go to borrow money, and the bank does not lend; you go to ask for electricity, and the power department does not approve; you want coal and steel, and there is no one to ask.

### 农民企业家苦恼何其多

　　农民企业家苦恼何其多
    我们对湖南的４８位优秀农民企业家进行了一次通讯调查，发现这些在兴办企业、发展农村商品中作出很大成绩的优秀农民企业家，仍然创业艰难，心中有难言苦衷，严重地挫伤了他们的积极性。
    ——“婆婆姥姥”多，厂长难自主。这些农民企业家普遍反映，在企业发展困难，生产搞不好时，上上下下无人过问。工厂一旦起死回生，效益好了，“婆婆姥姥”趋之若鹜。他们各唱各的调，彼此不协调，该管的不管，不该管的要管。结果，企业受干扰太多，厂长没有自主权。一位企业家写道：一是没有人权，二是没有财权，三是没有物权，事无巨细都得由乡政府领导恩准。有的乡政府不经企业同意，将大部分退下来的村党支部书记硬塞到厂里当副厂长，把工厂变成了休养所。相反，工厂要招工、聘人、辞退却没权。
    ——雁过拔毛多，企业难承受。几乎所有被调查的企业家都有此感。近年来，随着企业的发展，各种摊派有增无减，请求赞助，要求支持，巧立名目收费等等应接不暇。岳阳一位公司经理反映，他创办的公司三年没有向国家和上级要过一分钱，但三年来，共支付上面摊派款达１０万元。另外，到公司来要钱，要优惠价商品，来吃、来喝的人太多了。
    ——政策不落实，权益难保障。对新开办的企业中央早有规定可以免税１至３年，但政策归政策，执行部门各行其事，有的还硬性规定职工月工资超过６７．５元的要交所得税。
    ——事事得求人，天天要烧香。资金紧张，原材料告急，能源紧缺，这些问题经常困扰着所有被调查的企业家们。他们反映，乡镇企业像是个“孤儿”，天天讨饭度日遭白眼。你去要钱，银行不贷款；你去要电，电力部门不点头；你想要煤和钢材，更是求人无门。
