Chinese table tennis team leader and deputy director of the State Sports Commission, Xu Yinsheng, met today with Taiwanese sports figure and International Olympic Committee member, Wu Jingguo, in Dortmund. Upon seeing Wu, Xu immediately shook his hand and said, "Welcome to Beijing. If you can't make it to the Asian Youth Gymnastics Championships in April, you must come to the Asian Cup Table Tennis Championships in May!"

Wu replied, "Thank you very much. This time, sports exchanges across the Taiwan Strait are leading the way, and cultural exchanges will gradually increase. I really want to go to Beijing, but the specific time is not yet determined."

Xu said, "I have the deepest affection for table tennis. Originally, I thought that sports exchanges across the Taiwan Strait should start with table tennis, but it seems that your gymnastics team will be the first to come, which is also good."

During the sincere and friendly conversation, Xu also introduced the preparations for the 1990 Beijing Asian Games to Wu. Wu asked Xu to convey his greetings to He Zhenliang and other relevant figures in the mainland sports community.

　　徐寅生吴经国谈海峡两岸体育交往
    本报多特蒙德４月９日电记者刘小明、江建国报道：中国乒乓球代表团团长、国家体委副主任徐寅生今天在这里会见了我国台湾体育界知名人士、国际奥委会委员吴经国。徐寅生一见到吴经国的面就握着手说：“欢迎你到北京来，４月份的亚洲青年体操赛如果来不了，５月的亚洲杯乒乓球赛你一定要来啊！”
    吴经国说：“非常感谢，这回海峡两岸交往体育带了头，慢慢文化交流会更多起来。我很想去北京看看，具体时间一时还定不下来。”
    徐寅生说：“我对乒乓球最有感情，原来设想海峡两岸体育交往最好从乒乓球先突破，现在看来可能是你们的体操队第一个来，这也很好。”
    在诚恳友好的交谈中，徐寅生还向吴经国介绍了１９９０年北京亚运会的准备情况。吴经国请徐寅生代他向何振梁以及大陆体育界有关人士问候。
