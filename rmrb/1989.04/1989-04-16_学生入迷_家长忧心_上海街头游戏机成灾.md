Students are becoming obsessed, and parents are worried. Shanghai's streets are flooded with countless electronic game machines.

The reporter found on Fangbang East Road in the Nanshi District: within less than 200 meters on the eastern section of Shui Guo Street, there are 3 individual vendors operating game machines. Students crowd around, taking turns to play. The most crowded spot has 10 people. A cultural official from the Nanshi District Cultural Center told the reporter that there are no fewer than 200 such street game stalls in the Nanshi District.

Many students are addicted to these street game machines, which affects their studies and physical and mental health. A student from the 16th Primary School told the reporter: "All the boys in our class have played electronic game machines. Sometimes during class, we keep thinking about them. Some students even skip classes or cut school because of this." A student from the Zhabei District spent 150 yuan of his New Year's money in one go just to play the games.

Some parents and teachers are deeply concerned about this issue and have written letters to the municipal government and relevant departments, calling for stronger management. However, Shanghai City does not have a single effective supervising agency.

　　上海街头游戏机成灾
    据新华社上海４月１５日电　（实习生朱丹）上海街头涌现难以数计的电子游戏机。
    笔者在南市区方浜东路上发现：不到２００米的东段水果街上就有３家个体户经营的游戏机。小学生围在这里轮流“上机”，最多一处有１０人。南市区文化馆的同志告诉记者，像这种街头游戏机摊，南市区不下２００处。
    不少小学生迷恋于街头游戏机，影响了学业和身心健康。十六小学一个学生对记者说：“我们班上所有的男同学都玩过电子游戏机，有时候上课也老想着，还有的同学为这个旷课、逃学。”闸北区有一名学生为了玩过瘾，一次就掏出１５０元压岁钱。
    对此，有些家长、教师忧心忡忡，写信给市政府和有关部门，呼吁加强管理，而上海市竟无一个得力的主管单位。
