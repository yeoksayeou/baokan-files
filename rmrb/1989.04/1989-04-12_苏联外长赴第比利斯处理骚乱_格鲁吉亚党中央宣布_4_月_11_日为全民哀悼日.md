Soviet Foreign Minister Travels to Tbilisi to Handle Riots
Georgian Party Central Committee Declares April 11 as National Mourning Day

	Newspaper: Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 10

	Late on the night of the 8th, after serious riots broke out in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union dispatched Eduard Shevardnadze, a member of the Politburo and the Foreign Minister, who had served as the First Secretary of the Georgian Party Central Committee for 13 years, to Tbilisi to handle the incident. His scheduled visit to the German Democratic Republic from the 12th to the 13th has been postponed.

	This was announced today by Gennady Gerasimov, the Director of the Press Department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, at a press conference. He said that from 11 PM to 6 AM, a curfew is in effect in Tbilisi. The situation there is still tense but generally calm. Most enterprises in the city are operating as usual.

	On the night of the 8th and the early morning of the 9th, a conflict occurred between the crowd demonstrating in front of the government building of the republic and the police and soldiers, resulting in 16 deaths on the spot, including 10 women; 175 injuries, including 75 soldiers and police; and among the seriously injured sent to the hospital, two more women died later.

	Gerasimov revealed that the Georgian Party Central Committee held meetings on the 9th and 10th, attended by Shevardnadze and Alexander Yakovlev, a candidate member of the Politburo and Secretary of the Central Committee, who accompanied him to Tbilisi. The meeting decided to establish an investigation group led by Giorgi Chkheidze, the Chairman of the Georgian Council of Ministers. The meeting also decided to establish a funeral committee for the deceased and declared April 11 as a national mourning day in Georgia. Gerasimov said that Shevardnadze also met with representatives of the Georgian intelligentsia and leaders of public opinion organs.

	The spokesperson for the Soviet Foreign Ministry described the organizers of the demonstration as "extreme nationalists and political adventurists."

　　苏联外长赴第比利斯处理骚乱
　　格鲁吉亚党中央宣布4月11日为全民哀悼日
    新华社莫斯科4月10日电　8日深夜，格鲁吉亚首都第比利斯发生严重骚乱之后，苏共中央政治局9日派遣曾在格鲁吉亚任党中央第一书记达13年之久的苏共中央政治局委员、外交部长谢瓦尔德纳泽前往第比利斯，处理这一事件。他原定于12日至13日对民主德国的访问将推迟。
    这是苏联外交部新闻局局长格拉西莫夫今天在新闻发布会上宣布的。他说，每天晚上23时至次日凌晨6时第比利斯实行宵禁。目前那里的局势仍然紧张，但总的来说是平静的。该市的大多数企业照常开工。
    8日深夜和9日凌晨，在共和国政府大楼前举行示威的群众同民警和军人发生冲突，当场死16人，其中有10名妇女；伤175人，其中军人和民警75人；在送进医院的重伤员中，后来又有两名妇女死亡。
    格拉西莫夫透露，格鲁吉亚党中央9日和10日召开会议，谢瓦尔德纳泽和同他一起前往第比利斯的苏共中央政治局候补委员、中央书记拉祖莫夫斯基参加了会议。会上决定成立以格鲁吉亚部长会议主席奇赫伊泽为首的调查小组。会议还决定成立死难者治丧委员会，宣布4月11日为格鲁吉亚全民哀悼日。格拉西莫夫说，谢瓦尔德纳泽还会见了格鲁吉亚知识界的代表和舆论机关领导人。
    苏联外交部发言人称示威的组织者是“极端的民族主义分子和政治上的冒险主义分子”。
