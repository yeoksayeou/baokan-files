	When Wei Mingsheng was transferred and used the opportunity to indulge in feasting and taking gifts, some Party members and cadres firmly resisted him in various ways.

	When Wei Mingsheng was about to leave, some leaders of certain units actively invited this soon-to-be deputy director of the provincial Economic Commission to "bid farewell." However, after receiving the notice that Wei Mingsheng was coming to "say goodbye," the regional procuratorate, intermediate court, and land management bureau did not set up banquets or prepare snacks, but simply offered him a cup of tea. The deputy secretary of the regional disciplinary inspection commission and two deputy directors of the People's Bank of China's Ankang branch immediately refused to participate after receiving the notice to attend a "farewell meeting" for Wei Mingsheng. They angrily said, "The Communist Party does not follow such rules!" Regional committee advisor Zhang Rugan and vice chairman of the Ankang Municipal People's Congress Standing Committee Yang Yunting, after learning about Wei Mingsheng's actions, indignantly wrote to higher authorities to report Wei Mingsheng's disciplinary violations and a series of issues of abusing power for personal gain, requesting that higher authorities send someone to investigate and handle the matter.

	As the long "farewell tour" was coming to an end, Wei Mingsheng proposed to bid farewell to the heads of various departments in the regional government compound. The relevant department notified about eighty people to attend the "farewell meeting," but only half showed up. Moreover, the entire meeting was in a cold atmosphere, with no one except the host and Wei Mingsheng making any statements. In the end, the meeting dispersed unhappily. Those who attended the meeting commented, "Wei Mingsheng, taking advantage of his job transfer, eats from one place today and takes from another place tomorrow, which is really unacceptable!"

	Regarding some of the issues Wei Mingsheng had during his "farewell" process and before, the Ankang regional disciplinary inspection commission, despite pressure, insisted on sending someone to investigate and report to higher authorities truthfully.

　　魏明生借调动挥霍时有人说——
　　共产党不兴这一套
　　安康一些干部曾顶过这个“吃喝专员”
    新华社西安四月十九日电　（记者万武义、通讯员张运德）陕西安康原行署专员魏明生借调动之机四处吃喝拿要时，一些党员干部通过各种形式对其坚决抵制。
    在魏明生调离时，虽有一些单位的领导主动邀请这位即将赴任的省经委副主任前去“话别”，但地区检察分院、中级法院、土地管理局等单位在接到魏明生要来“告别”的电话通知以后，既没有设宴席，也没有备糖果，均以一杯清茶待客。地区纪律检查委员会书记和中国人民银行安康分行两位副行长在接到欢送魏明生“座谈会”的通知后，当即表示拒绝参加，他们气愤地说：共产党不兴这一套规矩！安康地委顾问张如乾、安康市人大常委会副主任杨云亭在了解到魏明生的所作所为后，愤然提笔向上反映魏明生的违纪行为和在此以前的一系列弄权谋私问题，请求上面派人查处。
    在漫长的“辞行”接近尾声的时候，魏明生提出要和行署机关大院各部门负责人“告别”。有关方面通知约八十人参加“欢送会”，结果到会者只有一半。而且整个会议始终处于冷场状态，除主持人和魏明生外，无一人表态发言，最后不欢而散。参加会的人议论说：魏明生借工作调动之机今天吃东家，明天拿西家，实在不象话！
    对于魏明生在“告别”过程中和以前的一些问题，安康地区纪检委顶住压力，坚持派专人进行调查并向上级如实反映。
