The national economy urgently needs electricity, but a batch of key mechanical enterprises that provide equipment for power construction are facing difficulties due to a shortage of funds. Today, representatives of these enterprises in Beijing appealed to the state to take measures to address the urgent needs of the enterprises.

The production cycle for power equipment is long, it consumes a lot of materials, and it occupies a lot of working capital. Currently, many key mechanical enterprises producing power equipment cannot purchase raw materials due to a shortage of funds, which affects normal production. Some factories even have difficulty paying wages. The Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory partially suspended production in some workshops in October last year. Recently, it solved some of the working capital issues and resumed production. The factory director, Rǔ Wèi, said that this money can only last until April 20.

The largest transformer factory in the country, the Shenyang Transformer Factory, saw a significant drop in production in the first quarter, and some transformers needed for key national power station projects could not be delivered on time. The factory director, Zuǒ Chánglín, said that this is a rare occurrence in many years, and all the employees are very sad and anxious.

According to the factory directors, the main reasons for the shortage of funds are: first, the prices of raw materials have risen significantly, and enterprises need to increase their working capital accordingly, but enterprises have very little self-owned working capital, and loans are difficult to obtain; second, there are serious arrears of payments between enterprises. Materials cannot be paid for upon delivery, and products cannot be collected upon shipment, mutual constraints, and the cycle is blocked, and no one can move.

### 流动资金短缺　货款拖欠严重　一批电力设备企业告急

　　流动资金短缺　货款拖欠严重
　　一批电力设备企业告急
    本报北京4月11日讯　记者皮树义报道：国民经济急需电力，为电力建设提供装备的一批骨干机械企业，却正因资金短缺面临困境。今天，这些企业的代表在京呼吁国家采取措施，解企业燃眉之急。
    电力设备生产周期长，耗用材料多，占用流动资金也多。目前，许多生产电力设备的骨干机械企业因资金短缺，买不进原材料，影响了正常生产，有的厂甚至发工资都难。太原重型机器厂去年10月部分车间被迫停产，最近解决了一部分流动资金，才恢复了生产。厂长汝慰曾说这些钱也只能维持到4月20日。
    全国最大的变压器厂——沈阳变压器厂，一季度生产大幅度滑坡，一些国家重点电站建设需要的变压器没能按期交货。厂长左长林说，这是多年来罕见的事情，我们全体职工非常痛心和不安。
    据厂长们反映，造成资金短缺的主要原因：一是原材料价格大幅度上涨，企业需要相应地增加流动资金，而企业自有流动资金很少，贷款又贷不到；二是企业间相互拖欠货款严重，材料到货付不出款，产品发出收不回款，互相制约，循环受阻，谁也活动不了。
