Over the past two years, Wanzhou County in Sichuan Province has experienced 13 incidents of primary and secondary school buildings collapsing, resulting in 62 injuries and deaths. Meanwhile, the county's education bureau has been busy constructing new buildings and purchasing imported tour buses, sparking strong public outcry.

Wanzhou currently has 1,458 primary and secondary schools with a total building area of over 610,000 square meters. Among these, 307 schools have severe structural issues, accounting for 21.1% of the total number of schools. The area of these dangerous buildings amounts to over 80,000 square meters, making up 13.1% of the total building area. This makes Wanzhou one of the counties with the most severe school building issues in the region. Due to the lack of timely repairs, three deaths have occurred in the series of school building collapses. Particularly severe incidents include two deaths that occurred just before and after Teachers' Day. On the night of Teachers' Day in 1987, a teacher's dormitory in Taiji Village, Longju Town, collapsed, killing an elderly teacher who was sleeping. On the day before Teachers' Day in 1988, a classroom in Muxi Village, Houshan Township, collapsed, killing one student and injuring 26 others. As a result, teachers and students in some schools live in constant fear, affecting normal teaching activities.

However, the county education bureau, which oversees these schools, has been constructing buildings and purchasing imported cars over the past three years, investing over 800,000 yuan. The total construction area amounts to over 5,100 square meters. In March 1986, under the guise of building a "research office building" and relocating a "dangerous building" for the county teachers' training school, 1.5 million yuan was invested to build a staff dormitory covering over 1,300 square meters. In early 1987, 800,000 yuan was spent to purchase a Japanese-imported tour bus. In April of the same year, under the pretext of building a "staff activity center," 2.3 million yuan was invested to build a guesthouse and a staff dormitory, for which the bureau was criticized by higher authorities and had to submit a written self-criticism. In July 1988, under the name of "staff collective investment," 2.3 million yuan (with only 950,000 yuan actually collected) was invested to build another staff dormitory. Before the original project was completed, a new project was started at the beginning of this year, with an investment of tens of millions of yuan.

On one hand, there are continuous incidents of school building collapses in primary and secondary schools at the grassroots level, while on the other hand, the county bureau is constantly building new buildings. Why has no one taken action against these abnormal phenomena?

　　万县学校危房两年垮塌十三起  教育局盖楼房三年投资数十万
    近两年多来，四川省万县发生中小学危房垮塌事故１３起，死伤６２人。与此同时，主管教育的县教育局却在大兴土木盖楼房、购置进口旅游车，群众反映十分强烈。
    万县现有中小学１４５８所，校舍总面积６１万多平方米，其中有严重危房的学校３０７所，占学校总数的２１．１％，危房面积达８万多平方米，占总面积的１３．１％，成为全地区学校危房严重县之一。由于危房改造不及时，在先后发生的校舍垮塌事故中死亡３人。情节严重的是，有两起死亡事故均发生在教师节前后。１９８７年教师节的晚上，该县龙驹镇太吉村小学教师宿舍倒塌，压死一位熟睡的老教师。１９８８年教师节的前一天，该县后山乡沐河村小学教室垮塌，当场压死学生１人，伤２６人。对此，有的学校的师生整天惶恐不安，提心吊胆，严重地影响了正常教学。
    但作为学校上级的县教育局，近３年来却以各种名义修房造屋、购置进口汽车，共投资８０余万元，建房面积５１００多平方米。其中，１９８６年３月用建“教研室办公楼”的名义，以县教师进修学校“危房搬迁”为借口，投资１５万元，修建了一幢面积达１３００多平方米的职工宿舍。１９８７年初花费８万元购置了一辆日本进口旅游车。４月，又用建“教工之家”的名义，投资２３万元，建了一幢招待所和一幢职工宿舍，为此受到上级批评，并作了书面检查。１９８８年７月又以“职工集资”的名义，投资２３万元（其中集资仅９．５万元），建职工宿舍一幢，原工程未完，今年初又新开工了一个项目，投资又是一、二十万元。
    一方面是基层中小学危房垮塌事故连续不断，而另一方面县局接二连三盖新房，这些不正常现象为什么没人管呢？
