According to a report from the China Urban News on March 16, data provided by the Ministry of Construction indicates that currently, over 200 cities in China are facing water shortages, which accounts for more than half of the total number of cities. Among these, 40 to 50 cities are severely affected.

The data shows that the tap water coverage rate in Chinese cities has reached 86%, with approximately 100 million urban residents. The average daily water consumption per person is over 160 liters. The 200-plus cities currently facing water shortages collectively lack about 1,200 million tons of water daily. Of this, industrial water shortages amount to about 800 million tons per day, affecting an annual industrial output value of approximately 20 billion yuan.

The primary causes of urban water shortages include the following three factors: First, some cities have insufficient water sources. In these cities, some have exhausted their water resources, while a significant number have had their original water sources polluted. Second, the existing water supply facilities in some cities are severely inadequate. Some water supply pipelines have long exceeded their service life, while others have pipe diameters that cannot meet the growing water supply demands, and some pipelines are of poor quality. Third, low water prices have led to a lack of self-development capabilities for water supply enterprises. Just the recent increase in electricity prices has resulted in a 20% increase in water price costs, coupled with other factors, the current water prices have formed a serious "inverted" situation, causing newly built water plants to operate at a loss upon commissioning.

### 我国二百多城市缺水

　　我国二百多城市缺水
    ３月１６日《中国城市导报》报道：据建设部提供的资料，目前我国缺水城市有２００多个，超过城市总数一半以上，其中严重缺水城市４０至５０个。
    这份资料表明，我国城市自来水普及率已达８６％，城市用水人口约一亿人，平均生活用水量为每人每天１６０多升。全国２００多个缺水城市目前每日共缺水１２００多万吨，其中工业缺水量每日８００万吨左右，每年影响工业产值约２００多亿元。
    造成城市缺水的原因，主要有以下三点：一是部分城市水源不足。在这部分城市中，有的属水源枯竭，另有相当一部分城市是由于原有水源被污染。二是部分城市现有供水设备能力严重不足。有的供水管道早已超过了使用年限，有的管道口径已无法适应日益膨胀的供水需求，还有一部分管道质量太差。三是水价低，致使供水企业失去自我发展能力。仅近年电力加价一项，就造成水价成本费提高２０％左右，加上其它诸多因素，目前水价已形成严重的“倒挂”局面，新水厂一投产就亏损。
