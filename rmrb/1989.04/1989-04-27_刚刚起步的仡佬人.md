In 1978, the Combing people numbered approximately 26,000, mainly scattered across western and northern Guizhou Province. Early this year, when we visited the Combing people in the Zunyi region of Guizhou Province, we learned that after Doutian and Wuchuan counties in this region were approved as "Combing and Miao Autonomous Counties," the Combing population suddenly increased to 180,000.

The director of the Zunyi regional ethnic affairs commission, Ha Wen, explained to us the reasons behind the change in the Combing population.

The Combing people, anciently known as "Liao," have been living a settled agricultural life in Guizhou for about two thousand years and can be considered one of the ancient indigenous ethnic groups of Guizhou. Many places in Guizhou still retain names like "Combing Village," "Combing Stream," "Combing Well," and "Combing Bridge."

So, did the Combing people disappear or migrate? Ha Wen explained that most Combing people live interspersed with the Han people, and their culture, lifestyle, production, and customs have all been influenced by the Han people. Therefore, from appearance and language, one cannot distinguish between Han and Combing people. Only in some households' fireplaces can one still see a faint trace of the ancient "Liao" people.

Have the Combing people's ethnic characteristics completely vanished? Ha Wen believes that this ethnic group still retains its ethnic characteristics in terms of psychological qualities and ethnic consciousness. It is based on these characteristics, as well as historical records and traditional customs, that after the "Gang of Four" was overthrown and the party's ethnic policies were implemented, the 180,000 people previously classified as Han were restored to the Combing ethnic group. The former old secretary of Pingzheng Combing Village in Zunyi County, now vice-chairman of the county political consultative conference, Tian Xingcai, recited a rhyme for us: "High mountains for the Miao, water for the Han, the Combing live in the rocky nooks." He then explained that the Combing people mostly live and survive in areas with many rocks and stones. Take Pingzheng Village for example; the entire village is situated on a large rocky mountain, and the narrow road leading to the village is also paved with stone blocks. Perhaps because of this, this ethnic group mostly uses "Tian" (field), "Shan" (mountain), and "Gang" (ridge) as surnames.

In Pingzheng Village, it had just rained, and the hard, dry soil had softened, making it a good time for plowing. We saw many fields being plowed. However, previously, this area did not engage in agricultural activities or plant winter crops during the winter.

The reality created by traditional concepts is quite severe. Old Secretary Tian Xingcai gave an example. Two neighboring villages—Shanbatree and Longjing—one is a Han village, and the other is a Combing village. The two villages have similar climates and soil conditions, and the number of households and amount of land are also roughly the same. However, in terms of economic development, Longjing is obviously lower than Shanbatree. For example, in 1986, the per capita income in Longjing Village was 280 yuan, while in Shanbatree Village, it was 544 yuan; per capita grain ownership in Longjing Village was 285 kilograms, while in Shanbatree Village, it was 499 kilograms; tobacco yield per unit area in Longjing Village was 90 kilograms, while in Shanbatree Village, it reached 131 kilograms.

At a meeting held in the region, we unexpectedly met with Zhou Shutang, the county magistrate of Wuchuan Combing Autonomous County, which was established in 1982. This Combing intellectual county magistrate, whose name is the same as the word for "study hall," proudly told me: Wuchuan is one of the counties in northern Guizhou with the most flourishing literary culture. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, it produced over 80 jinshi (the highest degree in the imperial examination system), and an ancient academy is still preserved in the county seat. Nowadays, the county's enthusiasm for education does not wane, with a school enrollment rate of over 80%, basic elimination of illiteracy, and the county middle school being a key middle school in the province.

The Combing people are an ethnic group that is breaking free from traditional constraints and moving towards advanced culture and technology, a group full of confidence.

### 刚刚起步的仡佬人

　　刚刚起步的仡佬人
    本报记者  邹大毅
    一九七八年时，仡佬族大约有二万六千人，主要散居在贵州省西部和北部。今年初，当我们来到仡佬族较集中的贵州省遵义地区采访时，才知道当这个地区的道真、务川两县被批准为“仡佬族苗族自治县”后，仡佬族人口一下子就增加到了十八万。
    遵义地区民委主任哈文向我们介绍了仡佬族人数变迁的个中缘由。
    仡佬，古称“僚”，大约两千年前就在贵州过着定居的农业生活，可说是贵州古老的土著民族了。现在贵州很多地方还保留着“仡佬寨”、“仡佬冲”、“仡佬井”、“仡佬桥”的称谓。
    那么仡佬族是消失了，还是迁徙了？哈文解释说，仡佬族大多与汉族杂居，文化、生活、生产、习俗，都受到汉族影响，所以从外观、语言你分不出汉族或是仡佬族了，只有一些人家中的火塘，似乎还透射出一星古“僚”人的余光。
    仡佬族的民族特征果真荡然无存了吗？哈文认为，这个民族在心理素质上和民族意识上，还保留着民族的特征。正是根据这些特征，加之历史资料、传统习俗为依据，在打倒“四人帮”以后落实党的民族政策时，将过去划为汉族的十八万人，恢复了仡佬族族别。遵义县平正仡佬族乡原任的老书记、现县政协副主席田兴才给我们念了一句顺口溜：“高山苗，水汉家，仡佬住在石旮旮。”他接着解释说，仡佬族多在山石较多的地方居住和生存。就拿平正乡来说，整个坐落在一个大石头山上，通往乡镇的窄小的公路，也全是用石块铺砌的。大概正因为如此，这个民族大多以“田”、“山”、“岗”等为姓。
    在平正乡。刚刚下过一场雨，久旱硬结的土地松软了，正是犁地的好时候，只见许多田地里，犁翻土浪。可是以前，这里冬季是不事农活、不种小春作物的。
    传统观念造成的现实是十分严峻的。老书记田兴才举了个例子。两个相邻的村子——杉巴树和龙井，前者为汉族聚居村，后者为仡佬族聚居村。两村气候、土质等自然条件基本相同，就是农户数也相同，田土数量也相当。但在经济发展水平上，龙井显然低于杉巴树。以一九八六年为例，人均收入，龙井村为二百八十元，而杉巴树村是五百四十四元；人均占有粮食，龙井村二百八十五公斤，杉巴树村却是四百九十九公斤；烤烟，龙井村单产是九十公斤，杉巴树村却达一百三十一公斤。
    在地区召开的一个会上，我们与一九八二年才成立的务川仡佬族自治县县长邹书堂不期而遇。这个和他的名字一样进过“书堂”的仡佬族知识分子县长，不无自豪地告诉我：务川是黔北文风最盛的县之一。明清时就出过八十多位进士，至今县城中还保存着一个古老的书院。如今，这个县就学之风不衰，全县入学率在百分之八十以上，基本扫除了文盲，县中学还是省里的重点中学呢。
    仡佬族，是一个正在摆脱传统的束缚，向先进文化、先进技术靠拢的民族，一个满怀信心的民族。
