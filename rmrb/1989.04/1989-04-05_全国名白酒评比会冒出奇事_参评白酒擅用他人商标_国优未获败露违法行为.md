The National Famous White Wine Evaluation Conference has revealed an unusual incident. Some wines participating in the evaluation have improperly used other people's trademarks. The illegal behavior of wines labeled as "National Quality" has been exposed.

The People's Daily, Beijing, April 4th - Today, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce and the China Consumers' Association reported that at the beginning of the year, during the Fifth National Famous White Wine Evaluation Conference, out of the 374 wines participating in the evaluation, 28 wines improperly used other people's registered trademarks or used other people's registered trademarks as product names or packaging. This accounts for 7.4% of the total wines evaluated. Additionally, 23 wines had trademark usage that violated relevant regulations for wine trademark management. More than 20 wines falsely used the titles "Chinese Famous Wine" and "Chinese Quality Wine."

The State Administration for Industry and Commerce's Trademark Bureau recently issued a notice requiring local authorities to investigate and punish the 27 enterprises that infringed upon other people's registered trademark exclusive rights. They also ordered the 23 enterprises that violated wine trademark management regulations to make timely corrections. The National Famous White Wine Evaluation Leading Group decided to cancel the evaluation qualifications for wines that constitute trademark infringement and falsely use the titles "Chinese Famous Wine" and "Chinese Quality Wine."

This National Famous Wine Evaluation Conference was held in January in Hefei, Anhui. All participating wines had previously received departmental or provincial-level awards. Relevant personnel expressed surprise at the number of issues that arose during this national wine evaluation conference. They stated that this indicates that Chinese enterprises' trademark awareness and legal consciousness urgently need improvement.

　　全国名白酒评比会冒出奇事
    ——参评白酒擅用他人商标　国优未获败露违法行为
    本报北京４月４日讯  记者潘岗今天从国家工商局和中国消费者协会获悉：在年初举行的第五届全国名白酒评比会上，参加评比的３７４种酒中，有２８种擅自使用他人注册商标，或把他人注册商标作为商品名称、装潢使用，占参评酒总数的７．４％，另有２３种白酒的商标使用违反了酒类商标管理的有关规定。还有２０多种白酒冒用“中国名酒”、“中国优质酒”称号。
    国家工商局商标局日前发出通知，要求各地对侵犯他人注册商标专用权的２７家企业依法查处；责令违反酒类商标管理规定的２３家企业，及时更改。全国名白酒评优领导小组决定，对构成商标侵权和冒用“中国名酒”、“中国优质酒”称号的白酒，取消参评资格。
    这次全国名酒评比会是１月份在安徽合肥市举行的。参加评比的白酒都获得过部、省优称号。有关人士对在全国性的酒类评比会上出现这么多问题表示惊讶，他说，这说明我国企业的商标意识和法律观念亟待提高。
