Britain to Strengthen Implementation of Fan Identification Card System

	Xinhua News Agency, London, April 17th — The British government announced today that, in light of the tragedy that occurred at the Sheffield football stadium on the 15th, the government will strengthen the implementation of the fan identification card system. This tragedy resulted in the deaths of 108 spectators in the chaos.

	British Home Secretary Douglas Hurd said in the House of Commons today that the government's January proposal to issue fan identification cards must continue to be implemented. According to this plan, troublesome fans will not be issued the necessary fan cards to enter football match venues, and courts have the authority to prevent them from traveling abroad. However, football industry figures have opposed the government's implementation of this plan due to economic reasons.

	Currently, there are still over forty injured individuals receiving treatment in hospitals, with five critically injured patients in life-threatening conditions. Prince Charles and Princess Diana of the United Kingdom visited some of the injured.

	The management of Liverpool Football Club has requested the cancellation of the match, but British Football Association Chairman Graham Kelly announced today that the semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest will be rescheduled for May 7th in Manchester.

　　英国将加强推行球迷身份卡制度
    新华社伦敦四月十七日电　英国政府今天宣布，鉴于十五日设菲尔德足球场发生的惨案，政府将加强推行球迷身份卡制度。这一惨案使一百零八名观众在混乱中丧生。
    英国内政大臣道格拉斯·赫德今天在下院说，政府一月份提出的颁发球迷身份卡的计划有必要继续实行下去。根据这个计划，闹事球迷将得不到进入足球比赛场地所必需的球迷卡，而且法院有权阻止他们出国旅行。但足球界人士出于经济原因，曾表示反对政府实施这一计划。
    在受伤的人中目前还有四十多人正在医院接受治疗，其中五名重伤者生命垂危。英国查尔斯王子和王妃戴安娜公主探望了一些受伤者。
    利物浦足球俱乐部的负责人已要求取消比赛，但英国足球联合会主席凯利今天宣布说，利物浦队和诺丁汉队之间的半决赛将于五月七日在曼彻斯特重新举行。
