Title: Bush Administration's Decision

After recent discussions, the Bush administration has made plans for the modernization of U.S. strategic weapons. On April 23, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney announced on a television program that President Bush had decided to simultaneously develop two types of mobile land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles. According to this plan, the United States will remove the existing 50 MX missiles from their silos and place them on rail cars, while continuing to develop another type of missile carried on large trucks.

Currently, the Bush administration's review of the entire strategic policy is not yet complete, but the decision on strategic weapons was made first, which is obviously closely related to the upcoming congressional debate on defense spending. A brief analysis of this decision shows that it is the result of President Bush's weighing of some real factors and his compromise on two different domestic opinions regarding land-based missiles. It also shows some policy changes different from the Reagan era.

Firstly, there is the relationship between reducing the budget deficit and modernizing strategic weapons. Regarding the modernization of strategic weapons, the most debated issue has always been how to increase the mobility and concealment of land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, thereby enhancing their survivability in a nuclear strike crisis. Over the past decade, various factions have compared dozens of plans, generally accepting two types of missiles: the MX missile and the Midgetman missile. However, each of these missiles has its pros and cons, and the debate has not ended. After Bush took office, the reality forced a re-examination. Recently, to reduce the massive budget deficit, the government and Congress reached an agreement that included further cuts in defense spending. In the context of relatively reduced military spending compared to the Reagan era, how to allocate and use the military budget, and how much money can be spent on strategic weapons and strategic defense, has become the focus of the issue.

Since Cheney took office as Secretary of Defense, he has been troubled by this, proposing a plan to first achieve the mobility of the MX missile with relatively less funding. According to estimates from the Pentagon, a total of $5.4 billion would be enough to complete the plan to place 50 MX missiles on rail cars by 1992. Cheney also advocated, given the budget constraints, abandoning the Midgetman missile, which is too expensive (it is estimated that developing 500 single-warhead Midgetman missiles would require $25 billion). However, this plan was criticized in the Democrat-controlled Congress, and there were also differing opinions within the government. The chairmen of the military committees in both the House and Senate even said that this plan would be difficult to pass in Congress, and they advocated the development of the Midgetman missile, believing it to be more mobile than the MX missile. From this, it can be seen that Bush's decision to develop both types of missiles is clearly aimed at achieving the mobility of intercontinental ballistic missiles while also considering the sentiments of Congress. It is reported that in the few years after 1990, the focus will be on making the MX missile mobile, while allocating $200-300 million annually to develop the Midgetman missile, and then deciding on whether to deploy it. However, to what extent Congress will accept this decision remains to be seen, and further changes cannot be ruled out.

The modernization of land-based missiles is also related to U.S.-Soviet nuclear negotiations. During the Reagan era, since the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI, or "Star Wars" program) was proposed in 1983, the focus has been on establishing an anti-ballistic missile defense system to protect U.S. intercontinental ballistic missiles, with less emphasis on mobility. However, the SDI program is too large in scale, and over the past few years, it has been found that there are many technical problems to be solved, and there has been ongoing debate domestically about whether it can be realized. Moreover, in nuclear negotiations, the U.S. and the Soviet Union have been at odds over whether the SDI program violates the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, making it the biggest obstacle to negotiations. The Bush administration is currently discussing reducing the SDI budget and changing its scale, while focusing on researching and developing a more cost-effective "Brilliant Pebbles" anti-ballistic missile system. It is against this background that the mobility of intercontinental ballistic missiles has been brought back to a prominent position, because according to the current state of U.S.-Soviet nuclear forces, the Soviet Union already has the SS-24 and SS-25 mobile missiles, and the United States cannot fall behind. It is said that the State Department supports Bush's decision to develop two types of mobile missiles, believing that this can improve the strategic position, increase negotiating leverage, and also keep the government and Congress in line, making it easier to reach a new nuclear treaty that can be approved by Congress. Undoubtedly, the U.S. decision will have an impact on future U.S.-Soviet nuclear negotiations.

### 布什政府的抉择

　　布什政府的抉择
    本报记者  张启昕
    经过最近几天的讨论，布什政府对美国战略武器现代化作出了计划。国防部长切尼４月２３日在电视节目中宣布，布什总统已决定同时发展两种机动的陆基洲际导弹。根据这项计划，美国将把现有的５０枚ＭＸ导弹从发射井移出，并把它们放置在铁道的车厢上，同时将继续发展另一种装载在大型卡车上的侏儒式导弹。
    目前，布什新政府对整个战略政策的回顾尚未全部完成，但对战略武器先行作出决定，显然是同国会即将辩论国防开支密切相关。对这项抉择略加分析，可以看到这是布什总统在权衡一些现实因素之后，对国内在陆基导弹问题上的两种不同意见进行调和妥协的结果，同时也可以看到，其中有一些不同于里根时代的政策变化。
    首先是缩减预算赤字与战略武器现代化的关系。关于战略武器现代化，历来争论最多的是如何增加陆基洲际导弹的机动性、隐蔽性，从而提高它在核打击危机时的生存能力。十几年来，争论的各方对几十种方案进行比较，大致能为接受的两种导弹就是ＭＸ导弹和侏儒导弹，然而这两种导弹各有利弊，争论并未终止。布什执政后，现实情况又促使它不得不重新审议。前不久，为了缩减庞大的预算赤字，政府与国会达成了一项协议，其中包括要对国防开支进一步缩减。在军费相对比里根年代减少的情况下，如何分配使用军费，能有多少钱花在战略武器和战略防御上，就成了问题的焦点。
    切尼出任国防部长后，一直为此伤神，曾经提出一种设想，即先花较少的经费实现ＭＸ导弹的机动性。据五角大楼估计总共花５４亿美元，就可以在１９９２年完成把５０枚ＭＸ导弹放置在铁道车厢上的计划。切尼还主张，鉴于预算拮据，放弃耗资过大的侏儒导弹（据估计发展５００枚单弹头的侏儒导弹需要２５０亿美元）。但这一方案在民主党控制的国会里遭到非议，政府内也有不同意见。众、参两院的军事委员会主席甚至说，这种方案难以在国会通过，他们力主发展侏儒导弹，认为这种导弹要比ＭＸ导弹更为机动。由此可见，布什作出两种导弹都发展的抉择，明显地是为了既实现洲际导弹的机动性，又考虑到国会的情绪。据透露，在１９９０年以后的几年内，重点是使ＭＸ导弹机动化，同时每年拨出２至３亿美元发展侏儒导弹，然后决定是否部署的问题。然而国会在何种程度上接受这种决策，还将有场辩论，尚不能排斥进一步变动的可能。
    陆基导弹的现代化还关系到美苏之间的核谈判。在里根年代，自从１９８３年提出战略防御计划（即星球大战计划）之后，重点放在建立一个反导弹防御系统，以保护美国洲际导弹的生存，而对机动性一度强调较少。但星球大战计划规模过大，几年来的情况表明，有许多技术问题有待解决，国内对它能否实现一直存在争论。而且，在核谈判中，美苏对星球大战计划是否违反反导弹条约的规定也争执不下，成了谈判的最大障碍之一。布什政府目前也在讨论削减星球大战计划的经费，改变其规模，而把重点放在研究和发展一种比较省钱的“灿烂卵石”的反导弹系统上。正是在这种背景下，实现洲际导弹的机动性又被提到重要地位，因为根据美苏核力量的现状，苏联已经有了ＳＳ—２４和ＳＳ—２５两种机动导弹，美国也不能落后。据说，国务院支持布什发展两种机动导弹抉择，认为这样可以改善战略地位，增加谈判筹码，同时可以使政府与国会保持一致，便于今后达成新的核条约容易得到国会批准。无疑，美国的抉择将会对今后的美苏核谈判产生影响。
