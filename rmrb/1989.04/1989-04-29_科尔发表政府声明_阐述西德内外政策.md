West German Chancellor Kohl today delivered the first government statement after a major cabinet reshuffle, detailing the government's domestic and foreign policies.

Kohl praised the reform policies of Soviet leader Gorbachev in his statement. He expressed hope that the West could contribute to the success of Soviet reforms through a forward-looking dialogue and cooperation policy.

Regarding relations with Eastern European countries, Kohl said that relations with Hungary are developing well. West Germany also intends to develop friendly relations with Poland, and he hopes to visit Poland "in the near future." In relations with East Germany, many areas have also improved.

Kohl outlined the West German government's position on issues to be discussed by NATO. He emphasized the following points: first, the West German government, like the alliance, believes that a deterrence strategy based on effective nuclear and conventional forces is irreplaceable; second, the development of the "Lance" short-range missile follow-on system is a U.S. decision; third, in the alliance's overall plan for arms control and disarmament, rapid negotiations on nuclear short-range missiles should be proposed to achieve the low-level common upper limits proposed by the alliance in 1987 and 1988; fourth, negotiations on artillery and atomic artillery shells should also be included in the overall plan to achieve significant reductions to common upper limits; fifth, the 1992 alliance decision on whether to adopt the "Lance" follow-on system in 1996, including the production and deployment of such a system.

Kohl emphasized that it is crucial whether greater security can be sought at low levels of nuclear and conventional forces, whether binding agreements can be reached with the Warsaw Pact to eliminate the capability for sudden and large-scale attacks, and whether greater mutual trust can be established through corresponding agreements.

In domestic affairs, Kohl outlined the government's plans and visions for environmental and energy policies, economics, finance, social policies, as well as family and internal security.

　　科尔发表政府声明  阐述西德内外政策
    新华社波恩４月２７日电（记者戴履斌）西德总理科尔今天在联邦议院发表内阁大改组后的第一个政府声明，详细阐述了政府的内政外交政策。
    科尔在声明中称赞苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫推行的改革政策。他希望西方“通过面向未来的对话与合作政策”为苏联改革取得成功作出贡献。
    在同东欧国家关系方面，科尔说，同匈牙利关系发展很好。西德也打算同波兰发展睦邻关系，他希望能在“不久的将来”访问波兰。在同民德关系中，很多领域也有改善。
    科尔就北大西洋联盟将讨论的问题阐述了西德政府的立场。他强调，第一、西德政府同联盟一样认为，建立在有效的核力量和常规力量基础上的威慑战略方案是无法取代的；第二、发展“长矛”短导后续系统是美国的决定；第三、在联盟军备控制和裁军总体方案中应提出迅速举行核短导谈判，以达到１９８７年和１９８８年联盟提出的低水平共同上限目标；第四、火炮、原子炮弹谈判也要包括在总体方案中，以通过大量削减达到共同上限；第五、１９９２年联盟决定，是否在１９９６年采用“长矛”后续系统，包括生产和部署这种系统。
    科尔强调指出，能否在核力量和常规力量低水平上谋求更大的安全，能否同华约达成消除突然和大规模进攻能力的约束性协议，以及能否通过相应的协议建立更大程度的相互信任，是具有决定性意义的。
    在内政方面，科尔就环保能源政策、经济、财政和社会政策以及家庭和内部安全等问题阐述了政府的打算和设想。
