The Haitian government announced on the evening of April 2 that a military coup attempt that occurred at 4:50 AM on April 2 had been thwarted, and President Avril continued to be in power. The situation has now returned to normal.

At 4:50 AM on April 2, President Avril was detained by a group of coup plotters and held in a military facility for several hours. During this time, the coup plotters planned to form a new government and intended to exile Avril to the Dominican Republic. Around noon, when the coup plotters took Avril to an airport outside Port-au-Prince, the presidential guard rescued him and brought him back to the National Palace. In the afternoon, the U.S. ambassador met with Avril. The Haitian government's statement only mentioned that some officers attempted to overthrow the government and surrounded the presidential palace, but it did not specify how the loyalist forces foiled the coup. The statement said: "General Avril is in control of the situation, ensuring social stability and the safety of life and property."

It is reported that the coup was planned by several former high-ranking officers who had been dismissed for involvement in drug trafficking. The army commander also participated in the coup.

　　海地政变流产　局势恢复正常
    政变策划者为参与贩毒的前高级军官
    综合本报华盛顿和加拉加斯４月３日电  记者张启昕、朱满庭报道：海地政府４月２日晚间宣布，２日凌晨发生的一起军事政变已被粉碎，总统阿夫里尔将军继续执政。目前局势已恢复正常。
    ２日凌晨４点５０分，阿夫里尔总统被一批政变官兵拘留，关押在一座军事设施中达数小时。其间，政变军官酝酿成立新政府，并准备把阿夫里尔放逐到多米尼加共和国。中午时分，当政变官兵把阿夫里尔带到太子港郊外机场时，总统府卫队将他营救了出来，送回国民宫。当天下午，美国大使会见了阿夫里尔。海地政府发表的公告只是说一些军官企图推翻政府，包围了总统府，但未说明忠于政府的部队是怎样粉碎这起政变的。公报说：“阿夫里尔将军控制着局势，保障着社会平静和生命财产安全”。
    据称，政变是几名因参与贩毒而被撤换的军官策划的。陆军司令也参与了政变。
