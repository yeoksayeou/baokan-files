Room Temperature Nuclear Fusion – A Major Breakthrough in Nuclear Fusion Research

On March 23, the University of Utah announced at a press conference that Professor Stanley Pons, head of the chemistry department, and Professor Martin Fleischmann of the University of Southampton in Britain had successfully achieved nuclear fusion at room temperature using ordinary experimental methods. The news shocked the global scientific community.

Nuclear fusion is a reaction in which atomic nuclei combine and release enormous amounts of energy. The fuel used in this process is light nuclei, commonly the isotopes of hydrogen—deuterium and tritium, which can be extracted from seawater. The sun and many other stars shine brightly due to the fusion of light nuclei. The explosion of a hydrogen bomb is also a result of nuclear fusion, but it is uncontrolled, and once it starts, it cannot be stopped, making it unsuitable as a civilian energy source. For many years, scientists have been racing to study controlled nuclear fusion. Now, the discovery by Fleischmann and Pons undoubtedly brings good news to nuclear fusion research.

The 61-year-old Fleischmann is a Czech-born British citizen. In the 1960s, he noticed some "strange" reactions during the concentration of deuterium. Pons, who went to Britain in 1975 to pursue a graduate degree, also discovered similar phenomena while researching the separation of isotopes using electrodes. Five years ago, during a hike in the Milky Creek Canyon outside Salt Lake City, the two electrochemists formed some novel ideas. They then decided, in Pons' kitchen in Salt Lake City, to "play around" and self-fund $100,000 to conduct an experiment that no one had ever done before. Despite the success rate being only one in a billion, to their surprise, this "one in a billion" success became a reality.

The experimental setup used by Fleischmann and Pons is extremely ordinary. Their method was as follows: in a 15-centimeter-high test tube, they filled it with heavy water containing the hydrogen isotope deuterium, at a temperature of 27 degrees Celsius, with insulation outside the test tube; they inserted two electrodes into the heavy water, one being a palladium cathode and the other a platinum anode, and added a small amount of metallic lithium; when an electric current was passed between the two electrodes, a miracle occurred in the test tube, releasing a large amount of energy, which was four times the input energy, and has since been increased to 100 times, and an increase in tritium and neutron quantities was observed. During the experiment, most of the palladium metal in 1 cubic centimeter was melted, and part of the experimental setup was destroyed. Pons and Professor Fleischmann are convinced that their experiment achieved a nuclear fusion reaction, not a common chemical reaction, because this reaction released a large amount of heat over a long period, and a detector was used to check for the escape of neutrons—a decisive indicator of a nuclear fusion reaction.

Currently, more than 20 research institutions and universities in the United States are attempting to replicate this experiment. The Texas Agricultural and Mechanical College and the Georgia Institute of Technology have confirmed the possibility of nuclear fusion at room temperature and measured the released heat and neutrons. The experiment at Washington State University also confirmed that heavy water can produce nuclear fusion. Fleischmann confirmed that he and Pons have applied for a patent for their discovery. However, some people hold negative or skeptical attitudes. Leonard Pake, director of the Nuclear Fusion Plasma Research Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that the scale of this experiment is too small to prove it is nuclear fusion. Some chemists believe that this is a special phenomenon that is currently difficult to explain.

Today, the scientific community's attention to room temperature nuclear fusion is similar to the excitement surrounding "high-temperature superconductivity" two years ago. Although, as Fleischmann said, much work needs to be done to apply this discovery, one thing is certain: this experiment at least provides a new approach to nuclear fusion research. Humanity's exploration of safe and affordable new energy sources may thus "turn a corner."

　　室温下实现核聚变    
    ——核聚变研究的重大突破
    曹聪
    ３月２３日，美国犹他大学在一次新闻发布会上宣布：该校化学系主任斯坦·庞斯教授与英国南安普顿大学马丁·弗莱希曼教授合作，采用普通的实验手段，成功地实现了室温核聚变。消息传出，世界科学界为之震惊。
    核聚变是原子核融合并释放出巨大能量的反应，它所用的燃料是轻核，常见的轻核是氢的同位素——氘和氚，可以从海水中提取。太阳和其他许多恒星光芒四射，就是轻核聚变的结果。氢弹爆炸就是核聚变，可是氢弹的核聚变是不可控制的，一发而不可收，不能充当民用能源。多年来，科学家竞相研究受控核聚变。如今，弗莱希曼和庞斯的发现，无疑给核聚变研究带来了“福音”。
    现年６１岁的弗莱希曼是英国籍的捷克斯洛伐克人。６０年代，他在浓缩氘的过程中，注意到一些他称为“奇异”的反应。庞斯于１９７５年到英国攻读研究生，从师弗莱希曼。他在研究用电极分离同位素时也发现了类似的怪现象。５年前，两位电化学家前往美国盐湖城郊外米尔克里克峡谷远足时，形成了一些新颖的设想。接着，他们在盐湖城庞斯家厨房里决定，“为闹着玩”而自筹１０万美元，去做一个前人从未做过的实验。尽管实验成功的可能性只有１０亿分之一，谁料，这“十亿分之一”的成功竟成了现实。
    弗莱希曼和庞斯所用的实验装置普通至极。他们的做法是：在１５厘米高的试管里装满含有氢的同位素氘的重水，温度为２７摄氏度，试管外面绝缘；在重水里插上两根电极，一根是钯阴极，另一个是铂阳极，并加入少量金属锂；当两个电极间通上电流时，试管内奇迹般地释放出大量能量，其释放的能量为输入能量的４倍，目前已提高到１００倍，并发现氚和中子数量增加。试验中，１立方厘米的钯金属大部分被熔化，一部分实验装置被毁坏。庞斯和弗莱希曼教授确信，他们的试验实现了核聚变反应，而不是普通的化学反应，因为这个反应长时间地释放出大量热量，使用探测器检查出了逸出的中子——核聚变反应的决定性标志。
    目前，美国已有２０多个研究机构和大学在仿效这一试验。得克萨斯农业机械学院和乔治亚理工学院的试验证实了室温下核聚变的可能，并测到了释放出来的热量和中子。华盛顿州立大学的试验也证实了重水可以产生核聚变。弗莱希曼证实，他和庞斯已为他们的发现申请了专利。但也有人对此持否定的或怀疑的态度。麻省理工学院核聚变等离子研究中心主任伦纳德·派克说，这一试验的规模太小，不足以说明是核聚变。有的化学家认为，这是一种特殊现象，目前尚难解释。
    今天科学界对室温核聚变的关注，如同两年前“超导热”方兴之时。尽管像弗莱希曼所说，要应用这一发现还需要做许多工作，但是，有一点是可以肯定的，这一实验至少为核聚变研究提供了一种新的思路。人类对既安全又廉价的新能源的探索可能由此而“柳暗花明”。
