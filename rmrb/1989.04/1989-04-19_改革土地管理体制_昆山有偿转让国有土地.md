The first county-level paid transfer of industrial land use rights in China was signed today in Kunshan County, Jiangsu Province. This marks the beginning of the land management system reform in Jiangsu Province.

The land transferred in this signing is a plot of 10,000 square meters in the Kunshan Economic and Technological Development Zone. The transfer period is 50 years, with a transfer fee of 1 million yuan. Representatives from the Kunshan County Land Management Bureau and Shanghai Shendai Company signed the agreement on behalf of the transferor and the transferee, respectively. The transferee will use this land to build standard factories.

The success of this land transfer has increased the attractiveness of the Kunshan Economic and Technological Development Zone to foreign investors. According to the county's regulations, any land use rights obtained through paid transfer are considered approved projects and can proceed with enterprise approval procedures. The industrial and commercial administration can then handle the registration formalities. Currently, more than 10 companies from the United States, Canada, France, Hong Kong, and Taiwan have sent representatives or written inquiries, all expressing interest in acquiring land.

　　昆山有偿转让国有土地
    本报昆山４月１９日电　国内首次县级土地工业用地使用权有偿转让，今天在江苏昆山县签约，这标志着江苏省土地管理体制改革开始起步。
    这次签约出让的是昆山县经济技术开发区一块面积为１万平方米的土地，出让年限为５０年，出让金额１００万元。该县土地管理局和上海申大公司负责人分别代表出让方和受让方在协议书上签字。受让方将用这块地建筑标准厂房。
    这项土地转让成功，增加了昆山经济技术开发区对外商的吸引力。据该县规定，凡采取有偿出让方式取得土地使用权，即视同立项，并可办理企业批准书手续，工商部门据此可办理登记手续。目前，已有美国、加拿大、法国、香港、台湾等国家和地区１０多家客商派员或来函联系，均有受让意向。　　（沈石声）
