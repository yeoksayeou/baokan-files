	Zimbabwe and the United Kingdom have differing views on the current situation in Southern Africa.

	Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said last night at a banquet welcoming British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher that many in Africa and the Non-Aligned Movement still have doubts about the true intentions of the South African authorities regarding peace in Angola and independence for Namibia.

	He said, "Zimbabwe does not believe that South Africa will allow free and fair elections to be held in Namibia."

	Mrs. Thatcher said in her speech that the prospects for peace and stability in Southern Africa are becoming increasingly promising. She added, "In other countries in Southern Africa, there is a growing sincerity in resolving conflicts through negotiations, as we have seen in the cases of Namibia and Angola."

	Mrs. Thatcher also said at a press conference held the same day that the best way to resolve the South African issue is through negotiations. She opposed imposing sanctions on South Africa.

	During her visit, Mrs. Thatcher announced that Britain would provide 10 million pounds in aid to Zimbabwe.

	Mrs. Thatcher arrived in Zimbabwe on March 28 for her first official visit and will leave later today to go to Malawi.

　　津总统对南非当局意图有怀疑  英首相称南部非洲和平希望大
    新华社哈拉雷３月３０日电  英国和津巴布韦对目前南部非洲局势的看法存在分歧。
    津巴布韦总统穆加贝昨天晚上在欢迎英国首相撒切尔夫人的宴会上说，非洲和不结盟运动中许多人迄今对南非当局在安哥拉和平和纳米比亚独立问题上的真正意图仍有怀疑。
    他说，津巴布韦不相信南非会允许在纳米比亚举行自由和公正的大选。
    撒切尔夫人在讲话中说，目前，实现南部非洲和平与稳定的希望已越来越大。她又说：“在南部非洲其他国家，对通过谈判解决冲突的诚意越来越大，我们在纳米比亚和安哥拉例子中已看到了这一点。”
    撒切尔夫人还在当天举行的记者招待会上说，解决南非问题的最佳方法是通过谈判。她不同意对南非实行制裁。
    在访问期间，撒切尔夫人宣布，英国向津巴布韦提供１千万英镑的援助。
    撒切尔夫人是２８日到达津巴布韦进行首次正式访问的，她今天晚些时候将离开这里去马拉维。
