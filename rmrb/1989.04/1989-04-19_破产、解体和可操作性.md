The Nanjing Transportation Electrical Appliance Factory, which had liabilities exceeding assets, was dissolved. A total of 197 employees and 84 retired workers were taken in by 36 factories under the light industry system. Some people have raised the question: The Bankruptcy Law has already been implemented, so why not let it go bankrupt? For this reason, the reporter visited Mr. Dai Xijia, Director of the Nanjing Light Industry Bureau.

Reporter: Please talk about the process of dissolving the Transportation Electrical Appliance Factory.

Dai: The factory was established in 1956 and mainly produced ballasts and marine electrical equipment. In the past, during the planned economy, raw materials were supplied and products were sold through the state, and the factory was quite prosperous for a few years. However, since 1983, when the market was opened up, the underlying issues of poor management and low efficiency were gradually exposed, leading to consecutive years of losses. The net value of the factory's fixed assets was only 180,000 yuan, while its debts amounted to 560,000 yuan. Last July, the bank froze the factory's funds, and the employees had to take an extended leave, returning home and receiving 60% of their wages from the bureau. We had published an advertisement in the newspaper seeking mergers and acquisitions, and more than 30 enterprises came to investigate, but no agreement was reached. In the end, we had to adopt the method of self-digestion within the system, which was a last resort.

Reporter: What has been the reaction from various parties?

Dai: The reactions from various parties have been generally positive. At least, there have been no complaints. When the news was first announced, some older workers were heartbroken, and some even shed tears: "Who would have thought that the factory, which was built with mud and water, would collapse like this." But when they saw that they had new places to go, they felt relieved: "At least before dying, there is a place to fall back on." Some younger people were quite indifferent, especially those who had found second jobs outside, and they were even hoping for this outcome. By the time the dissolution was announced, two workers were still missing. It turned out they had gone to do business in another province.

The reactions from outside were also good. Responsible persons from the Light Industry Bureau, Machinery Bureau, and Packaging Company called me to say: "This is better, a quick solution to a messy situation. Otherwise, dragging it on would be endless!" Some expressed that they would also handle the mess within their system in this way.

Reporter: Which departments did you consult before the dissolution?

Dai: This time, I did not consult beforehand nor did I report afterward. I think this is within the scope of responsibilities of the supervising bureau. Once it is resolved, it is resolved. If you formally consult, how would they respond? It would still be vague language like "be cautious." I understand the procedures in the government compound!

Reporter: Some people think that the dissolution goes against the Bankruptcy Law. What is your view?

Dai: In a situation where the social security system is not perfect, it is not feasible to strictly enforce enterprise bankruptcy. I thought of a problem, which is the "operability" of various decisions. Some decisions sound good in theory but are difficult to implement in practice, mainly because they lack operability. I often say I am the general manager of the main factory. Whenever an enterprise lacks raw materials, funds, electricity, etc., they all come to the bureau for help. These are specific problems that cannot be pushed aside or avoided; we must come up with specific solutions. This time, dissolving the Transportation Electrical Appliance Factory went smoothly, but the workload was enormous. I have made it clear to the factory directors: this is a one-time thing, and it will not happen again.

### 破产、解体和可操作性

　　破产、解体和可操作性
    本报记者　龚永泉
    南京交通电器厂资不抵债，被解体了，一百九十七名职工和八十四名退休工人被二轻系统三十六家工厂接收。一些人士提出：《破产法》已经实施，为什么不让它倒闭？为此，记者走访了南京市二轻局局长戴锡嘉。
    记者：请谈谈交通电器厂解体的经过。
    戴：这个厂成立于一九五六年，主要生产镇流器和船用电器。前些年，在产品经济情况下，原料包供，产品包销，厂里也红火过几年，但从一九八三年，市场一放开，原先掩盖着的管理差、效益低的矛盾也逐步暴露出来，连年亏损，工厂固定资产净值只有十八万元，而负债却达五十六万元。去年七月，银行冻结了该厂资金，职工只好放长假回家，由局里发百分之六十的工资。我们曾在报纸上登了招标兼并的启事，先后有三十多家企业前来探查，但都没有谈成，最后只好采取在本系统内自我消化的解体，这是没有办法的办法。
    记者：各方面反映如何？
    戴：各方面反映还可以，起码骂声还没有听到。刚宣布消息，一些老工人痛心疾首，有的甚至老泪纵横：“想不到，当年一把泥、一把水创办起来的工厂，就这么垮了”；但见分到新单位又宽了心：“临死前总算有了个落脚的窝”；一些年轻人则满不在乎，特别是有的在外面找了第二职业的，巴不得这样下去。到宣布解体时，还有两个工人找不到，原来是到外地做生意去了。
    外界的反映也不错，一轻局、机械局、包装公司也有负责人给我打电话说：“还是这样好，快刀斩乱麻，否则，拖下去哪里是个头？！”有的表示对本系统的烂摊子也要这样做。
    记者：解体前请示了哪些部门？
    戴：这次我既没事前请示，也未事后汇报，我认为这是主管局职责范围内的事，解决了也就解决了。你如果正而八经地请示，他上面如何作答？还不是“要慎重”一类的模糊语言？机关大院子里的那一套程序我懂！
    记者：有人认为解体之举同《破产法》相悖，您如何看？
    戴：在社会保障体系不健全的情况下，不能硬性强调让企业破产。我想到一个问题，就是各种决策的“可操作性”，一些决策推论起来是很好的，在实践中却很难执行，主要原因就是缺乏可操作性。我常说我是总厂厂长，哪个企业缺了原材料、资金、电等，都来局里叫，这些都是具体问题，推不了，躲不掉，都要拿出具体的办法。这次我们解体交通电器厂还顺当，不过，工作量太大。我向厂长们表了态：偶一为之，下不为例。
