Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 29th.

Hu Qili, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, met with a delegation from the Friedrich Ebert Foundation of the Federal Republic of Germany, headed by its President, Holger Börner, this morning in Zhongnanhai.

Hu Qili said to the guests, "In the past few years, the Foundation has helped to promote friendly relations between some provinces and cities in China and some states in the Federal Republic of Germany. The development of relations between the Communist Party of China and the Social Democratic Party of Germany has been very good, and this is inseparable from the work of the Foundation."

Börner said, "The Foundation is willing to continue to provide assistance for China's reform and opening up, including providing professional consultations and scholarships."

Hu Qili, at the guests' request, introduced the situation of China's reform and opening up. He said, "In the past 10 years, China has achieved great success in this regard, but it has also encountered some difficulties. China's goal of reform and opening up will not change, but the steps taken must be suitable for China's national conditions."

The Friedrich Ebert Foundation is a public welfare institution and one of the oldest political foundations in the Federal Republic of Germany.

　　胡启立会见联邦德国客人
    据新华社北京４月２９日电  中共中央政治局常委胡启立今天上午在中南海会见了联邦德国艾伯特基金会会长霍尔格·伯尔纳一行。
    胡启立对客人说，在过去几年中，基金会协助推动中国一些省市同联邦德国一些州建立了友好关系。中国共产党同德国社会民主党的关系发展很好，这同基金会的工作是分不开的。
    伯尔纳说，基金会愿意继续为中国的改革开放提供援助，包括提供专业咨询和发放奖学金。
    胡启立应客人要求介绍了中国的改革开放情况。他说，１０年来中国在这方面取得了很大成绩，但也遇到了一些困难。中国改革开放的目标不会变，但采取的步骤要适合中国国情。
    艾伯特基金会是社会公益性机构，也是联邦德国历史最悠久的政治基金会之一。
