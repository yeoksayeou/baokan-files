Late at night, the display windows of Parisian shops still shine brightly, leading one to wonder if the French value energy conservation. Recently, the reporter visited the Energy Control Agency and found that France places great importance on energy conservation and has implemented many effective measures.

In the office, Mr. Bouysse, who is in charge of training and public relations for the agency, first showed the reporter a chart. He said that from 1973 to 1986, France's GDP increased by 32%, while energy consumption only increased by 6.5%, saving 3,400 tons of oil equivalent annually, which is about 1/5 of the total annual energy consumption. This figure convincingly proves that France has achieved significant results in improving energy efficiency.

Over the past decade, the French government has allocated investment funds for energy conservation (approximately 500 million francs per year, sometimes reaching over 1 billion francs), enacted energy conservation laws, and improved energy conservation institutions, all of which are measures taken to implement the energy conservation strategy.

Organizationally, establishing a functional agency is also very important. The French Energy Control Agency was established in 1982. It is not a government department but a public institution that receives guidance and assistance from the government. The Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Science and Technology allocate activity funds to it each year. It continuously provides policy suggestions and research results to the government and society. People particularly mention that this 400-person agency has also established 26 branch offices nationwide, forming a large network with energy conservation as its goal.

When discussing energy conservation methods, he cited many examples, such as extensive propaganda and legislation. However, looking at the main responsibilities of the agency, more emphasis is placed on finding scientific methods to achieve energy conservation goals. Residential buildings and the tertiary sector in France consume the most energy, accounting for about 44%, and have the greatest potential for energy conservation. In recent years, the agency has collaborated with enterprise research departments to continuously experiment and improve wall insulation layers, expand lighting, and improve centralized heating equipment. Mr. Bouysse also mentioned the issue of car fuel consumption. Statistics show that most of the oil imported by France is used for transportation, with cars alone consuming 40 million tons of oil per year. The agency supported Renault's development of the "Mesta" model small car two years ago, which consumes only 2.8 liters of fuel per 100 kilometers (ordinary cars need 8 liters). It is imaginable that when this achievement is commercialized, it will make a significant contribution to energy conservation.

### 法国节能战略的显著成果

　　法国节能战略的显著成果
　　本报记者　张启华
    深夜，巴黎商店的橱窗依然灯火辉煌，人们不禁会问，法国人爱惜能源吗？近日记者走访了能源控制总署，所得的印象是，法国非常重视节能，并采取了许多行之有效的办法。
    在办公室里，负责总署培训和公共关系的布依舒先生，首先拿出一份图表给记者看。他说，从1973年至1986年，法国国内生产总值增加32％，而能耗只增加6.5％，每年节能达3400吨当量的石油，等于一年耗能总量的1／5。这个数字令人信服地证明，法国在提高能源效益方面取得了十分显著的效果。
    10多年来，法国政府为节能拨出投资款项（每年5亿法郎左右，多时达10多亿法郎），制订节能法、以及改善节能机构，都是为了实现节能战略而采取的措施。
    从组织上说，建立一个职能机关也是很重要的。法国能源控制总署于1982年建立，它不是政府的一个部门，而是接受政府指导和援助的公共机构，政府的工业部、科研部每年拨给活动经费。它不断地向政府、社会提政策建议和研究成果。人们特别提到，这个400人的机构，还在全国26个地方成立分署，从而形成了一个以节能为目标的大网络。
    在谈到节能的办法时，他列举了许多例子，比如广泛的宣传立法等。但从总署主要职责来看，更多的则是寻找科学的办法，达到节能的目的。法国居民住宅和第三产业耗能最多，约占44％，节能的潜力也最大，近几年来，总署联合企业研究部门，不断试验、改进墙板隔热层。扩大光照，改善统一供热设备等。布依舒先生还提到汽车耗油的问题。据统计，法国进口的石油，大部分用于交通，仅汽车一年就耗油4000万吨，总署前年支持雷诺汽车公司研制“梅斯塔”型小汽车，100公里耗油量只需2.8升（普通汽车则需要8升）。可以想象，当这项成果实现商业化，一定能为节能作出巨大贡献。
