In the winter of 1989, the World University Games had just concluded, and Guo Hongzhu, who had won three gold medals, set her sights on the upcoming World Championships. She said, "Only by winning gold in the world's top-level competitions can one truly be called a world champion." Today, her wish has finally come true.

She stood on the high podium as the gold medal winner of the women's 3000 meters in the World Short Track Speed Skating Championships, her face adorned with a sweet smile.

On the ice, Guo Hongzhu was full of vigor and spirit. Off the ice, she was straightforward and simple, speaking without any surprises. She said, "After arriving in the UK, due to jet lag and poor diet, I felt my strength was not good in the first two days of competition, and I did not achieve the expected results. Today's 3000-meter race is the last event for women, and if China does not win a medal, we will return empty-handed."

"I feel my strength is good today," she said calmly. "I thought I should give it my all and strive for a championship."

She thought and did, finally winning the first world championship in China's ice and snow events since 1963!

This World Championships gathered almost all the top athletes from various countries. Canadian athletes even gave up the opportunity to participate in the University Games in Sofia to show off in this competition. Compared to the world's top athletes, Guo Hongzhu, who was only in her second international competition, how could it be easy to win a gold medal?

After the starting gun for the 3000 meters, the eight girls raced fiercely, none yielding. With only two laps left, the Dutch athlete Koetsveld collided with China's Zhang Yanmei and Canada's Perreault, and she herself crashed into the barrier. At this moment, Guo Hongzhu, who was closely following behind, seized the opportunity and sprinted to the finish line first.

"You are now a 'true world champion.' What are your next plans?"

Guo Hongzhu paused for a moment and said, "After returning to the country, the first thing I will do is go home to visit my mother. Then, next year, I will train hard to achieve even better results."

　　在冰上拚搏的巾帼
    ——记速滑世界冠军郭洪茹
    今年3月的冬季世界大学生运动会刚结束，夺得3枚金牌的郭洪茹就盯上了这次世界锦标赛。她说，只有在世界最高水平的比赛中拿到金牌，才算是真正的世界冠军。今天，她的愿望终于变成了现实。
    她作为世界短跑道速滑锦标赛女子3000米比赛金牌获得者，站在了高高的领奖台上，脸上挂着甜甜的微笑。
    滑冰场上英姿勃发的郭洪茹，场下是一副直爽朴实的样子，说话也毫无惊人之语。她说，来到英国之后，由于时差关系和伙食不适，在前两天的比赛中她感到体力不好，没取得预想的成绩。今天的3000米比赛是女子最后一项比赛，中国再拿不到奖牌，就要空手而归了。
      “我今天感觉体力不错，想着还是要拚一下，争取拚出个冠军来。”她淡淡地说。
    她想到做到，终于拚出了自1963年以来我国在冰雪项目中的第一个世界冠军！
    这次世界锦标赛几乎集中了各国所有强手，加拿大的好手还放弃了去索非亚参加大学生运动会的机会，专等着在这次比赛中大出风头。同各国高手相比，仅是第二次出国比赛的郭洪茹要拿金牌谈何容易？
    3000米比赛枪响以后，八位姑娘风驰电掣，互不相让。离终点只剩两圈时，滑在前面的荷兰选手科茨韦尔德撞到了我国另一位女将张艳梅和加拿大选手佩雷奥特，她自己也冲向挡板。这时，紧紧跟在后面的郭洪茹看准机会奋力冲刺，率先冲过了终点线。
      “你现在已经成了‘真正的世界冠军’，下一步有什么打算？”
    郭洪茹想了片刻，说：“回国后，我的第一件事就是回家看望妈妈。然后，明年抓紧训练，争取创造更好的成绩。”
