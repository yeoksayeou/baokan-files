People's Daily reports: The head of the Chinese delegation, Li Daoyi, spoke at the 45th annual meeting of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (APESC) on the 28th. He said that APESC is the most important intergovernmental economic and social cooperation organization in the region, and has long played an active role in promoting Asia-Pacific cooperation. Facing the challenges of the 1990s, we hope that APESC will play an even greater role in promoting regional cooperation.

He pointed out: "To achieve sustained and stable economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region, it is necessary for the countries of the region to work together, improve the external economic environment, and promote the development and prosperity of the countries in the region."

He expressed the hope that the major developed countries, while carrying out their own structural adjustments, should fully consider the interests of developing countries and take effective measures to open their markets to the latter, increase the transfer of funds, and accelerate the transfer of technology.

Li Daoyi introduced the remarkable achievements China has made in its 10-year economic system reform.

He said: "Ten years of practice have proven that economic system reform is a very arduous and complex process. In the transition from the old to the new economic system, it is inevitable that some new problems will arise. Currently, the Chinese government is working to improve the economic environment and rectify the economic order to create a good environment and conditions for the comprehensive deepening of reforms."

He emphasized: "Rectification and rectification do not mean a halt to reform, but rather the continuation of reform."

He said that the Chinese government especially values protecting Sino-foreign joint ventures from being affected, honoring various trade contracts signed with foreign businesses, and continuing to adhere to the policy of comprehensive opening up.

　　我代表团长在亚太经社会年会发言指出
    亚太经济繁荣需各国合作
    本报讯  出席联合国亚太经社委员会第４５届年会的中国代表团团长李道豫２８日在会上发言时说，亚太经社会是本区域最重要的政府间经社合作组织，长期以来为推动亚太合作发挥了积极的作用。面对９０年代的挑战，我们希望亚太经社会在推动区域合作方面发挥更大的作用。
    他指出：“要取得亚太经济的持续稳定增长，需要亚太各国协力合作，改善外部经济环境，促进本地区各国的发展与繁荣。”
    他表示希望，主要发达国家在进行自身结构调整时，应充分顾及发展中国家的利益，采取有效措施向后者开放市场、增加资金转移、加快技术转让。
    李道豫介绍了中国在１０年经济体制改革中所取得的举世瞩目的成就。
    他说：“１０年的实践证明，经济体制的改革是一个非常艰巨复杂的过程。在新、旧经济体制交替过程中不可避免要出现一些新的问题。当前，中国政府正在从事治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序，为全面深化改革创造良好的环境和条件。”
    他强调说：“治理和整顿绝不意味着改革的停顿，而是改革的继续推进。”
    他说，中国政府特别注重保护中外合资企业不受影响，信守与外商签订的各种经贸合同，继续坚持全面开放的政策。
