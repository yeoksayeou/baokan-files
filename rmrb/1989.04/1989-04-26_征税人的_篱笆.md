The Tax Collector's "Fence"

    Ou Liang

    Listening to the radio, a certain individual entrepreneur who had been in business for many years had never paid taxes. This person, with a conscience not yet extinguished, had several times gone to the tax office to handle the matter. Unfortunately, the tax officials cursed him, calling him a "fool" and a "dumbass." The reasoning was, "You should pay the state a thousand yuan in taxes, but if you give me a hundred yuan, you can get by, saving most of it. Don't you get it?"

    It is said that among a considerable number of individual entrepreneurs, tax evasion is a common occurrence. Previously, it was thought that the responsibility lay entirely with the individual entrepreneurs. After hearing this broadcast, it became clear that this was not the case. Taxpayers hiding and not paying taxes are indeed wrong, but tax collectors not collecting taxes in order to seek personal gain are even more despicable.

    Analyzing the situation, tax collectors not collecting taxes have various manifestations. Some are passive, as in the saying, "He who takes your hand is soft, and he who eats your mouth is short"; others are active, using their "authority" to transform the power to collect taxes for the state into a personal privilege to extract "grease," which is very easy to do, and if you don't take it, you're missing out! There are also those who just go with the flow, or are even dragged into dereliction of duty, thinking, "If everyone else is drunk, why should I be the only one sober?" Moreover, some higher-ups are also "turning a blind eye," watching the tax money that should be in the treasury flow away and pretending not to know, so why should I act like a hero?

    Taxation is an important means of regulating personal income and an important channel for increasing state revenue. Currently, there is a shortage of tax personnel, and the vast majority work hard and do a lot of work. However, there are some tax personnel with low quality issues that need to be urgently addressed. Especially, their sense of responsibility and ideological awareness need to be improved. Whether the law enforcement personnel "tighten the fence" or "open the fence" has a great impact on the state of taxation in our country.

    Improving the ideological awareness of tax collectors is a very arduous task. However, precisely because it is arduous and important, it is necessary to make a decisive effort to grasp it. Because the power to deal with money is more easily corrupted than ordinary power. It is said that in ancient times, near Guangzhou's Stone Gate, there was a clear spring called the "Greed Spring," which once intoxicated many clean officials, turning them into corrupt officials and bureaucrats. Of course, there were also those who did not go with the flow, such as Jin Dynasty's Wu Yin Zhong, who drank from this spring and became even more clean, which is an example. Although the legend cannot be taken as true, its meaning is still enlightening to people today. The tax collectors face a spring of money with countless eyes, is it not just such a "clear spring"? To become a Wu Yin Zhong of today, on the one hand, it is necessary to strictly enforce the law, and on the other hand, it is necessary to have the awareness to remain unmoved by ten thousand ounces of gold. Tax collectors who are not moved by money are also not few in the tax team, and they should be listed as models, so that their colleagues can learn from examples and know shame and honor.

### 征税人的“篱笆”

　　征税人的“篱笆”
    瓯亮
    听电台广播，某个体工商户经营多年，从未交纳过税款。此人良心未泯，曾几次登门办税。无奈税务人员骂他“傻冒，二百五”，道理是，“你向国家应缴的千元税款中，只要孝敬我百元就可搪塞过去了，可省下大头，这还不懂么？”
    据说，在相当一部分个体户中，偷税漏税是司空见惯的现象。以前，只以为责任尽在个体户一方。听了这段广播，始知不然，纳税人隐匿不纳，固然不该，征税人不征税，以图私利，其行为更是可恶。
    分析起来，征税人不去征税，其表现也有种种的不同。有的是被动的，所谓“拿人家的手软，吃人家的嘴短”；有的是主动的，“权”是可以变化用场的，将为国家征税的职权变成为个人捞“油水”的特权，容易得很，不捞白不捞！还有的则是“随大流”，甚至是被襄挟着渎职的，人家不管，何必“世人皆醉我独醒”呢？更何况一些比“我”大的“头头”都“睁一只眼闭一只眼”，看着本可入库的税金哗哗流走而故作不知，我又何必充英雄好汉呢。
    税收，是调节个人收入的重要手段，是增加国家财源的重要渠道。目前，税务人员不足，绝大多数辛辛苦苦做了许多工作，但是有一些税务人员素质不高的问题亟待解决。特别是要提高他们的责任感和思想觉悟。执法的人是“扎紧篱笆”，还是“打开篱笆”，对我国征税的状况影响很大。
    提高税收人员的思想觉悟，是件很艰巨的工作。但是唯其艰巨，唯其重要，就非下决心狠抓不可。因为，与金钱打交道的权力，比一般的权力更容易被腐蚀。相传古代的广州近郊石门，有一清泉，名曰“贪泉”，曾经醉倒许多清廉之士，乃至一个个都变成了贪官污吏。当然，也有不同流合污的，晋人吴隐之饮此泉而更加清廉，即一例。传说虽不可当真，但其寓意对今人亦有启发。税收人员面对的千眼万眼金钱之泉，不就是这样的“清泉”么？要成为当今的吴隐之，一方面是要严肃法纪，一方面是要有面对万金不为所动的觉悟。不为金钱所动的税务员，在税务队伍中也是不少的，应该把他们列为标兵，使同行们学有榜样，知荣知耻。
