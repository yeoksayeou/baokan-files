The newly appointed Governor of Anhui, Fu Xishou, said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency, "Integrity, diligence, and democracy are crucial aspects of improving and strengthening government work."

This straightforward new governor said, "Currently, the reform is at a critical juncture with many contradictions and problems. The success of reform and opening up largely depends on whether the political climate remains clean. We must treat maintaining integrity and preventing corruption as a major task. The provincial government and its subordinate departments' principal leaders must not only be personally upright but also organize and lead their departments to be upright and dedicated, setting a good example and truly becoming a role model for the entire province."

He criticized past negative practices. He said, "Last year, the provincial government set a bad example in some areas, such as the incident of renovating houses beyond the standard, although corrections were made, the impact was bad. In some government agencies, there are indeed phenomena of using power for personal gain, bribery, and corruption. Some illegal and disciplinary violations still occur, and there are still instances of defying orders and prohibitions, which have tarnished the image of state organs in the eyes of the people."

This new governor, who is known for his bold and straightforward work style, revealed to the reporter that the provincial government plans to seriously discuss the opinions raised by the deputies after the People's Congress, check and rectify past issues, and supplement or amend the regulations on integrity. "Lead by example," he said, "What we demand of others, we must first do ourselves. Starting from the provincial government agencies, we will set an example for the entire province."

Fu Xishou said, "While advocating for integrity, it is also urgent to emphasize diligence. Currently, the people are not only dissatisfied with those who are corrupt but also have many complaints about those who are not diligent. Many good decisions that are beneficial to reform and construction have not been implemented for a long time. One important reason is that the officials lack the spirit of public service and are not diligent. Therefore, in the future, the most important thing for the provincial government is to emphasize 'substance,' start from reality, do more practical things, seek practical results, and focus on implementation."

He said, "Improving and strengthening government work must also be democratic. Democracy is the foundation for preventing and overcoming bureaucratism and for genuinely serving the people well. Therefore, government departments this year will focus on institutionalization, legalization, democratization, scientification, and improving work efficiency and effectiveness. There should be a group of people working on the front lines, and there should also be a group of people with both theoretical knowledge and practical experience, who are detached from daily affairs, to engage in research and consulting. At the same time, we should often communicate with the people and grassroots cadres; for major issues of concern to the people, we should timely and specifically report the situation to the people through various forms such as press conferences, symposiums, and reports, to ensure that information flows from top to bottom and from bottom to top, and to avoid major decision-making mistakes."

　　安徽新任省长傅锡寿谈改善政府工作    
    廉洁勤政民主维系改革成败    
    政府必须“正人先正己”　省直机关要做全省表率
    新华社合肥４月２７日电（记者王正忠）刚刚当选为安徽省省长的傅锡寿，在接受新华社记者采访时说：“廉洁、勤政、民主是改善和加强政府工作的重要环节。”
    这位性情直爽的新省长说：“当前，改革正处在关键时期，矛盾和问题很多。改革开放的成功与否，很大程度上取决于政风是否清廉。我们必须把保持廉洁、防止腐败作为一项重要任务来抓。省政府和所属各部门的主要领导人，不仅要自身廉洁，还要组织、带动自己主管的部门廉洁奉公，带出一个好的风气，真正成为全省的表率。”
    他批评了过去的不好现象。他说：“去年，省政府在有的问题上带了不好的头，比如发生过超标准维修住房的情况，虽然做了纠正，但影响很坏。在一些政府机关中，也确实存在着以权谋私、贪污受贿等腐败现象，某些违法违纪时有发生，有令不行、有禁不止的现象仍然存在，玷污了国家机关在人民群众中的形象。”
    这位工作大胆泼辣的新省长向记者透露，省政府准备在人代会后，认真讨论代表们提出的意见，按照过几年紧日子的要求，对照检查，并对过去制订的廉政方面的规定作一些补充或修改。“正人先正己”，要求下面做到的自己先做到，从省直机关抓起，一级抓一级，给全省做出榜样和表率。
    傅锡寿说：“在提倡廉政的同时，亟需强调勤政。目前，人民群众不但对为政不廉者极为不满，对为政不勤者也颇多怨言。现在有许多有利于改革和建设的好决策，之所以迟迟贯彻不下去，其中一个重要原因就是为政者缺乏公仆精神，为政不勤。因此，今后在这点上，省政府最重要的是抓‘实’字，从实际出发，多办实事，讲求实效，狠抓落实。”
    他说：“改善和加强政府工作还必须民主。民主是防止和克服官僚主义，扎扎实实地为群众办好事、办实事的基础。所以，政府部门今年着重在制度化、法制化、民主化、科学化和提高工作效率、效能上下功夫，既要有一大批人在第一线工作，也要有一批既有理论知识，又有实践经验，超脱日常事务的人员从事调研和咨询研究。同时，还要经常同人民群众和基层干部对话；对人民群众关心的重大问题，要适时地有针对性地通过新闻发布会、座谈会、报告会等多种形式，向人民群众通报情况，做到上情下达，下情上达，避免重大决策失误。”
