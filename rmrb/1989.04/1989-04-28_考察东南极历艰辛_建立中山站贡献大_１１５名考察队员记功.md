The summary and commendation meeting for China's first East Antarctic expedition was held in Beijing today.

The Chinese Antarctic Expedition Committee awarded 115 expedition members who made significant contributions during the East Antarctic expedition with commendations and awards. Chen Dehong, Guo Kun, Wei Wenliang, Gao Zhensheng, Xin Zhaojian, and Xu Jinghong received first-class merit citations; Gao Qinquan, Xu Shaojun, Zhang Jimin, Gao Dengyi, and 52 other comrades received second-class merit citations; Hu Xikun, Jiang Dezhong, Fu Jinping, Qiao Gang, and 57 other comrades received third-class merit citations. At the same time, the first Chinese East Antarctic expedition team was awarded a collective first-class merit citation, and the Chinese Polar Research Vessel "Jidi" was also awarded a collective first-class merit citation.

According to reports, from November 20, 1988, to April 10, 1989, the first Chinese East Antarctic expedition team fought together for 142 days. They braved the roaring winds and fierce waves of the Westerlies, navigated through the ice floe zone, advanced into the Antarctic Circle, broke through the obstacles of the ice shelf, overcame the dangers caused by ice avalanches, sailed 17,876 nautical miles, and successfully established the "Chinese Antarctic Zhongshan Station" on the Larsemann Hills of East Antarctica. They achieved the goal of building the station and overwintering in the same year, making new contributions to the development of China's polar and marine sciences.

During this expedition, in addition to the main task of building the station, the scientific research team also conducted surveys in areas such as mapping, geological structure, terrain, marine environment, and climate impact, laying a foundation for future Antarctic scientific expeditions.

    据介绍，１９８８年１１月２０日至１９８９年４月１０日，中国首次东南极考察队团结奋战１４２天，穿越西风带狂风恶浪，闯过浮冰区，挺进南极圈，冲破陆缘冰阻挡，战胜冰崩造成的危险，航行１７８７６海里，在东南极大陆拉斯曼丘陵上成功建立了“中国南极中山站”，实现了当年建站当年越冬的奋斗目标，为发展我国极地科学事业和海洋事业做出了新的贡献。
    这次考察活动在建站为主的前提下，科研考察人员还进行了测绘和地质结构、地形地貌、海洋环境、气候影响等方面的科学考察，为今后的南极科学考察奠定了基础。
