Title: "Forced Learning" and "Superficial Compliance"

Recently, I attended a meeting of factory directors and managers. The creator of the "full-load operation method," Zhang Xingrang, the director of the First Plastic Factory in Shijiazhuang, made a remark that was quite thought-provoking. He said, "Factory directors seeking advice should consider whether it can bring benefits to the enterprise. If the experience is not suitable for the enterprise, forcing it to learn will either fail or result in superficial compliance!"

It is appropriate for supervisory departments to promote certain enterprise experiences, providing information and encouragement. However, when these experiences reach the enterprises, the actual situation must be considered. If the enterprise itself is not interested, and the supervisory department insists on them learning it, they will only engage in superficial compliance. Not long ago, I visited a city and encountered a similar case. A factory in this city had some notable management practices and good economic performance. Thus, the municipal government decided to promote these practices throughout the city's industrial and commercial system. Later, the provincial government decided to implement them across the entire province's industrial and commercial system. However, many enterprises were not convinced.

Promoting an experience solely through administrative means often leads to the opposite of the intended result. For example, the experiences of Daqing and Dazhai originally had some merits, but later, they were exaggerated and turned into universal experiences. Industries were told to learn from Daqing, and agriculture from Dazhai, leading to many difficulties. This method of promotion easily leads to "campaigns," formalism, and ultimately, failure. These lessons are too profound to ignore.

Different industries and types of enterprises have varying scales, technologies, equipment, and workforce qualities. The depth of reform in different regions and industries also varies, each with its own characteristics. Therefore, enterprises should strengthen management by addressing their specific problems. Whether an enterprise can learn from others' experiences and what to learn should be determined by whether it fits their situation. There is no one-size-fits-all "cure."

Relying on decisions to promote an experience reflects some supervisory departments' habit of using old methods to manage enterprises. Sometimes, they even know that certain experiences may not be effective in their region, but they still issue documents and make decisions. This is truly unacceptable! Today, enterprises are gradually breaking free from the old system's constraints, becoming independent economic entities. Good experiences that are related to the economic performance of enterprises will not only be learned by them but will also be secretly adopted, even without publicity. This is far better than that superficial compliance.

　　“逼着学”与“虚应付”
　　墨村
    最近，参加一个厂长、经理座谈会，“满负荷工作法”创造者——石家庄第一塑料厂厂长张兴让的一段话，对人很有启发。他说：“厂长‘取经’，要看它是否能给企业带来效益，不适合本企业的经验，逼着学，也学不了，要么就是虚应付！”
    主管部门重视一些企业的经验，给大家提供信息，加强提倡，是应该的。但是这些经验到了企业，就要看实际情况了，如果企业本身没有兴趣，主管部门硬要他们学，就只好“虚应付”。不久前，记者到一个市采访就碰到一例。这个市有家企业在管理上有些名堂，企业效益不错。于是，先是市政府作出决定，在全市工交系统推广；稍后，省政府又决定在全省工交系统推行。但是一些企业对此并不以为然。
    一味用行政手段推广一种经验，往往事与愿违。比如，大庆、大寨，原来的经验确有可取之处，可后来，不仅夸大，变成全面的经验，而且工业就学一个大庆，农业就学一个大寨，吃了不少苦头。这种推广方式，很容易“刮风”，搞形式，落实祸，这样的教训太深了。
    不同行业、不同类型的企业，规模、工艺、技术装备、职工素质都不相同，各地区、各行业改革的进程深度也不完全一样，各有各的特点。所以，企业加强管理，应该从解决自己的具体问题着手，别人的经验能否学得来，学什么？要看对不对号，没有包治百病的“药方”。
    靠作决定来推广某个经验，反映了一些主管部门仍习惯于过去管理企业的老办法。有时甚至也知道一些经验在本地区不一定能发挥效力，也照样发个文件，做个决定，这实在不可取！今天，企业正在逐渐摆脱旧体制的桎梏，成为独立的经济实体，与企业经济效益有着利害关系的好经验，他们不仅要学，甚至没有声张的，也会偷偷去学。这比那种“虚应付”不知强多少倍。
