If we say that this generation of young people has experienced the "diploma craze," "political career craze," "business craze," and "study abroad craze," then now, amidst these waves of enthusiasm, there is another trend of "mixing it up." In the conversations of young people, "mixing" is a word frequently used. Friends who happen to meet might ask, "Where are you mixing it up these days?" Classmates exchanging greetings might say, "How are you mixing it up?" To express feeling unappreciated, one might say, "Just mixing it up." If things are going well, one might say, "Getting by, mixing it up." When reaching the age of 30, one might sigh, "Still haven't mixed it up to become someone!"

Among those who frequently use the word "mixing," some are just using it casually, but there are also quite a few who are genuinely "mixing it up." The ways of "mixing" are varied, but they can be broadly categorized into two types: the apathetic type and the hedonistic type.

The apathetic type finds everything uninteresting. Studying, pursuing a master's or doctoral degree, is uninteresting; making money, with all the deceit and trickery, is uninteresting; holding office, having to deal with superiors and subordinates, is uninteresting; going abroad, though the pay is good, it's too tiring, also uninteresting; quitting the job to start a business, the risk is high, and it's undignified, still uninteresting.

The hedonistic type is even more skilled. They enjoy the moment, drinking today's wine today.

Someone might say, it's unfair to just blame those who "mix it up," why not look into the social roots of the "mixing craze." Finding social causes for problems is understandable, but it shouldn't be used as an excuse to shirk personal responsibility. Even if it's society's various factors that drive one to do it, the head is still on one's own shoulders. Can one not take responsibility for the consequences of one's own actions? A region or a department's work mistakes can be adjusted in time, but life is irreversible. If one misses the good opportunities, it will be too late to regret!

### 说“混”

　　说“混”
    北京机械工业管理干部学院  韩铁林
    如果说这一代青年人经历了“文凭热”、“从政热”、“经商热”、“出国热”的话，那么如今在这阵阵热风中又夹杂了一股“混热”。在青年人的言谈话语中，“混”算得上使用率很高的字了。朋友偶尔相遇：“在哪混呢？”同学互致问候：“混得怎么样？”表示怀才不遇：“混呗！”还算春风得意：“凑和着混。”到了而立之年，感叹“还没混出个人样哪！”
    在言必称“混”的人当中，有的不过是嘴上过过瘾而已，可也确有为数不少的人在那里实实在在地“混”。“混”的方式虽然多种多样，但归纳起来不外乎两大类：没劲派和享乐派。
    没劲派，干啥都没兴趣。念书，当研究生做博士，没劲；赚钱，坑蒙拐骗，满身铜臭，没劲；当官，要应付上下级实在不易，没劲；出国，挣钱虽多可太辛苦，也没劲；辞职单干吧，风险大，还失了体面，还是没劲。
    享乐派却比没劲派“技高一筹”。他们及时行乐，今朝有酒今朝醉。
    有人会说，仅仅怪罪“混世者”太不公平，为何不去挖挖“混热”的社会根源。遇事找社会原因固然无可非议，但却不能成为开脱个人责任的理由。纵使是社会的诸多因素逼得去做的，但脑袋毕竟长在自己身上，难道个人就不要对自己行为的后果负责？一个地区、一个部门工作中的失误可以及时调整，而人生具有一去不复返性，混过了大好时机，则追悔莫及矣！
