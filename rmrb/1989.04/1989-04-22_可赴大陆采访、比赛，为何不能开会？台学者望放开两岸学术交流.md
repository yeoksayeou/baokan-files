		Why Can They Go for Interviews and Competitions but Not for Meetings?
		Taiwan Scholars Hope for Open Academic Exchange Across the Strait

		According to a report by the New China News Agency in Hong Kong on April 21, the Taiwan "Ministry of Education" recently required a Taiwanese snake venom research expert, Li Zhenyuan, who was invited to attend the Beijing International Toxin Symposium, to go to the mainland under the pretext of "visiting relatives." Li Zhenyuan, who has no relatives to visit on the mainland, refused.

		Li Zhenyuan stated that since he was invited to attend an international conference on the mainland, why should he have to go under the pretext of "visiting relatives"? The president of the "Academia Sinica," Wu Da-you, expressed his "great sorrow" over the government's deceptive tactics, saying, "It's clearly a meeting, but they say it's visiting relatives, it's simply forcing people to lie. Now reporters can go to the mainland for interviews, athletes can go for competitions, but scholars can only go for visiting relatives and not for meetings. I wonder what the government's standards are?"

		The China Times reported that last year, scholars from the "Academia Sinica" already attended the International Science Union annual meeting on the mainland. Now, academic exchanges across the strait are still "blocked," for what reason? Currently, many Taiwanese scholars hope to be able to attend relevant academic conferences on the mainland to which they have been invited.

　　可赴大陆采访、比赛，为何不能开会？    
    台学者望放开两岸学术交流
    据新华社香港４月２１日电  据台湾《中国时报》报道，台湾“教育部”日前要求受邀出席北京国际毒素研讨会的台湾蛇毒研究专家李镇源以“探亲”名义前往大陆，在大陆并无亲可探的李镇源予以拒绝。
    李镇源表示，既是受邀到大陆出席国际会议，何必假借“探亲”名义前往。台湾“中央研究院”院长吴大猷对当局的掩耳盗铃作法表示“十分痛心”，他说，“明明是开会，却要说探亲，简直是逼人说谎。现在记者可以去大陆采访，运动员可以去比赛，学者却只能探亲不能去开会，不知当局的标准何在？”
    《中国时报》报道指出，去年已有“中研院”的学者到大陆参加国际科学总会年会，如今两岸学术交流却仍然“此路不通”，理由安在？目前许多台湾学者都希望能够出席受邀参加的大陆有关学术会议。
