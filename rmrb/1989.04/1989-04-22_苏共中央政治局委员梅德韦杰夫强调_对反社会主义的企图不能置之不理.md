	Soviet Politburo Member, Central Committee Secretary Medvedev emphasized on the 21st that “opposition and extremism cannot solve any problems,” and that “attempts to use democracy and openness to oppose reform, and even socialism and the constitution, cannot be ignored.”

	Medvedev made these remarks at a meeting held in the Kremlin to commemorate the 119th anniversary of Lenin's birth. Speaking about political reforms in the Soviet Union, he said that in some regions, street demonstrations and gatherings increasingly involved the use of violence and presented ultimatums. He pointed out, “Irresponsible actions will push the country towards a dangerous situation of social and political instability, posing a serious threat to reform.” He said, “The people's government is incompatible with lawlessness and arbitrary actions. Without ensuring the necessary order and a solid legal mechanism, a law-based state is unthinkable.”

	Medvedev discussed the ethnic conflicts that have occurred in the Soviet Union in recent years, noting that it is impossible to solve complex ethnic relations outside of reform, and that without the unity of all the peoples of the Soviet Union, reform cannot be achieved.

	Medvedev said that the Soviet Union's economic reforms have encountered many difficulties and obstacles. He believes that a rapid reform of the economic mechanism cannot avoid touching upon ownership relations and that various forms of ownership should have equal rights. He said that reform will increase income disparities, but without overcoming egalitarian sentiments, the Soviet Union will remain stagnant.

	Medvedev emphasized that commodity-monetary relations should be actively utilized, and that management and use of the market should be learned.

	Medvedev said that the peaceful competition will promote the development of socialism. The various forms, models, and methods of socialism enrich socialism and demonstrate its vitality. At the same time, the experience of non-socialist countries should not be overlooked.

	Gorbachev, Ryzhkov, and other Soviet leaders attended the commemorative meeting.

　　苏共中央政治局委员梅德韦杰夫强调    
    对反社会主义的企图不能置之不理
    新华社莫斯科４月２１日电（记者唐修哲）苏共中央政治局委员、中央书记梅德韦杰夫２１日强调指出，“对抗和极端主义不能解决任何问题”，“对利用民主和公开性来达到反对改革，甚至反对社会主义，反对宪法目的的企图不能置之不理”。
    梅德韦杰夫在克里姆林宫举行的纪念列宁诞辰１１９周年大会上作了报告。他在谈到苏联的政治体制改革时说，在某些地区的街头民主和集会中越来越频繁地出现了使用暴力的做法，提出最后通牒式的要求。他指出，“不负责任的行动会把国家推向社会和政治不稳定的危险境地，对改革会造成严重的威胁。”他说，人民政权同无法无天和一意孤行是水火不相容的。保证不了应有的秩序和牢固的法律机制，法制国家是不可思议的。
    梅德韦杰夫谈到苏联近年来发生的民族纠纷时指出，不可能在改革之外来解决复杂的民族关系问题，没有苏联各族人民的团结一致，就不能实现改革。
    梅德韦杰夫说，苏联的经济改革遇到了不少困难和阻力。他认为，急剧改革经济机制不能不触及所有制关系，应该让各种所有制的形式具有相同的权利。他说，改革会使收入的悬殊加大，但不克服平均主义的情绪，苏联就会在原地踏步不前。
    梅德韦杰夫强调，应积极利用商品货币关系，学会管理和利用市场。
    梅德韦杰夫说，和平竞赛会促进社会主义的发展。社会主义的多种形式、多种模式和方法丰富了社会主义，展示了社会主义的生命力。与此同时，也不能忽视非社会主义国家的经验。
    戈尔巴乔夫、雷日科夫等苏联领导人出席了纪念大会。
