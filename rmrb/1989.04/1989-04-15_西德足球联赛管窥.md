Europe's football fans are world-renowned. The UK is well-known, and fans in West Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, and other countries are equally passionate. During my coverage of the World Table Tennis Championships, I found some spare time to experience a West German first-division football match. The match took place on a Sunday afternoon at 4:30 PM at the Westfalen Stadium, adjacent to the World Table Tennis Championships venue. The match featured the home team, Dortmund, against Bremen from the north. Since both teams were in the middle to lower part of the league standings, a loss for either could mean relegation, making this match crucial.

Dortmund is an industrial city with many workers who are football fans. Around 2 PM, fans from all directions rushed to the stadium. The usually empty subways and light rail trains were packed with fans. I was squeezed between tall Germans and could barely breathe. After getting off the train, I saw a parking lot next to the stadium, filled with cars. The cheering from the stands could be heard from far away.

I noticed many people wearing yellow and black striped scarves, and some young people even carried yellow and black flags. I later learned that these were the colors of the Dortmund team. During the match, fans of the two teams sat in different sections of the stands. One side was yellow and black, the other green and white, neatly divided. Naturally, the home team's fans outnumbered the visitors.

The stadium, which can hold over 40,000 people, quickly filled up. Although the match hadn't started yet, the fans were already shouting and singing, though I couldn't understand a word. I noticed that the flagpoles in the fans' hands had been shortened. It turned out that any flagpole over two meters long was cut in half by the police at the entrance. There were many police both inside and outside the stadium, and mounted police patrolled the area. Cans and glass bottles of beer were not allowed inside.

From the moment I entered the stadium, my ears were assaulted by high-decibel noise. All around were those horn-like noisemakers that make a loud sound when squeezed, and handheld whistles that made a rattling noise when shaken. I was the only Chinese person in the stands, and the fans were too engrossed in cheering to notice me.

The match began, and although neither team had world-class stars, both sides played with great effort. Every player gave their all, running and fighting for the ball, and shooting with power and precision. In the end, Dortmund truly lived up to their fans' enthusiastic support, winning 3-1.

After the fans cheered for a while, they dispersed calmly, with no excessive behavior. However, on the subway back to my accommodation, two fans seemed to have had too much to drink and were loudly discussing the match, arguing until their faces were red.

　　西德足球联赛管窥
    本报记者　刘小明
    欧洲的足球迷世界出名。英国不必说了，西德、荷兰、意大利等国的球迷也步其后尘，迷得疯狂。采访世界乒乓球锦标赛期间，我忙里抽闲，花８马克领略了一场西德甲级足球赛的场面。这场球正逢周末，下午四点半开赛，地点就在世乒赛赛场威斯特法伦体育馆旁边的同名体育场。比赛双方是东道主多特蒙德队迎战北部的布来梅队。由于两队在联赛中积分均列中间偏后，谁输了都可能降级，这一仗至关重要。
    多特蒙德是一个工业城市，工人中球迷特多。下午两点来钟，球迷们从四面八方奔赴体育场。平时空荡荡的地铁和轻轨电车里挤满了球迷。我被个子高大的德国人夹在中间透不过气。下了车，见道边一个比足球场大一倍的停车场上，小汽车停得满满的。场外老远已能听到场内拉拉队的歌声。
    我见许多人披着黄底黑条纹的围巾，有的青年人还打着黄黑两色旗帜。一问方知这就是多特蒙德队的标志。看比赛时，两队球迷集中在不同的看台，这边一片黄黑，那边一片绿白，整整齐齐，阵营分明。这天当然是主队球迷人多势众。
    能容纳四万多人的体育场很快挤满了观众，离球赛开始尚有一段时间，可球迷们忘乎所以地喊呀、唱呀，一句我也听不懂。我发现球迷手中的旗杆忽然短了不少，原来凡超过两米的旗杆，在看台入口均被警察一掰两截。场内场外警察来看可是不少，还有骑警巡逻。易拉罐和玻璃瓶装啤酒不准带入场内。
    从我入场的那一刻起，耳边始终被高分贝的噪音侵扰。四周尽是那种不用费力吹，一捏就大叫起来的气喇叭，还有拿在手里一摇哗哗作响的风轮。看台上只有我一个中国人，球迷们只顾加油，顾不上注意还有个东方人看球。
    比赛开始了，两队中虽然都没有知名的世界级明星，但双方小伙子踢得确实够意思。没有一名队员不尽全力，拚命地跑，拚命地抢，射门又硬又狠。最后，多特蒙德队还真对得起本地球迷卖力的助威，以３∶１夺得胜利。
    球迷们欢呼了一阵后，散场时还算平静，没有什么过分之举。不过在我回住地的地铁上，有两位球迷似乎喝多了，还在大声议论着球赛，争得脸红脖子粗。
