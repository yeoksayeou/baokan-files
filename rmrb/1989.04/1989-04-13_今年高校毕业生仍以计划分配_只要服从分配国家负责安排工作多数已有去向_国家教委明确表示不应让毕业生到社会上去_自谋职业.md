This year's university graduates will still be allocated through the planned system. As long as they comply with the allocation, the state will be responsible for arranging their jobs. Most graduates have already found their destinations.

The State Education Commission today stated that graduates should not be allowed to seek jobs on their own in society.

The People's Daily reported from Beijing on April 12: Correspondent Bi Quan Zhong reports that a spokesperson from the State Education Commission this afternoon discussed the progress and existing problems of this year's university graduate allocation work. The spokesperson said: This year's nationwide university graduate allocation work started early and has progressed smoothly. For students who are currently studying, as long as they qualify for graduation and comply with the allocation, the state will still be responsible for arranging their jobs. By April, many provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, and relevant ministries and commissions have organized large-scale recruitment and recommendation meetings with the participation of schools and employers. Most graduates have found their destinations. The graduates from schools under the State Education Commission have mostly had their allocation plans confirmed, with about 70% of engineering school graduates, 60% of comprehensive university graduates, and the vast majority of foreign language school graduates having found specific employers.

Regarding the problems in this year's university graduate allocation work, the spokesperson said there are mainly three issues. First, some graduates have unrealistically high expectations for job allocation. The sectors that need graduates the most are factories, mines, and small to medium-sized cities and grassroots units, which conflicts with the intentions of many graduates. Second, some places have a mismatch between the supply and demand of graduates, requiring nationwide adjustments. Third, some schools let graduates seek jobs on their own in society, which has had some negative effects. The spokesperson emphasized: Currently, the state still mainly uses the planned allocation method for university graduates. It is acceptable for some graduates to go to society to understand demand information, but not to let them seek jobs on their own. In the absence of a mechanism for seeking jobs on one's own in society, graduates will encounter many difficulties and problems, leading to misunderstandings and unease among students, parents, and society.

Addressing the above issues, the spokesperson of the State Education Commission pointed out: It is necessary to seriously implement the state's policies and principles regarding allocation work, increase the transparency of allocation work, and strengthen social supervision. Local authorities and employers should adopt a long-term perspective to view the temporary difficulties brought by economic adjustments and the lack of coordination in allocation work, personnel, and labor system reforms, and actively absorb graduates with a responsible attitude and properly arrange their jobs. Schools, students, and employers should not interpret the principle of "matching education with employment" too narrowly but should expand the allocation destinations based on the actual needs of society. Efforts should be made to mobilize a batch of science and liberal arts graduates to teach in middle schools, and the state will take corresponding measures to encourage this.

    今年高校毕业生仍以计划分配
　　只要服从分配国家负责安排工作多数已有去向
　　国家教委明确表示不应让毕业生到社会上去“自谋职业”
    本报北京4月12日讯　记者毕全忠报道：国家教委发言人今天下午就今年高校毕业生分配工作的进展情况和存在问题发表谈话。发言人说：今年全国高校毕业生分配工作开展得早，工作进展顺利。对已在校学习的学生，凡是取得毕业资格的，只要他们服从分配，国家还是负责安排工作的。截至4月份，全国不少省、自治区、直辖市和有关部委都组织了大规模的有学校和用人单位参加的招聘、推荐会，大部分毕业生有了去向。国家教委所属学校的毕业生多数已落实了分配方案，其中工科学校70％左右、综合大学60％左右、外语学校的绝大部分毕业生都找到了具体用人单位。
    谈到今年高校毕业生分配工作中的问题时，发言人说，主要有三个问题。首先是一些毕业生对工作分配的期望过高，不切实际。需要毕业生较多的是厂矿和中小城市、基层单位，这与不少毕业生的意向发生矛盾。其次是一些地方生源与需求不符合，需要在全国范围内调剂。第三是有些学校让毕业生到社会上去“自谋职业”，产生了一些不好影响。这位发言人强调指出：目前国家对高校毕业生仍然实行计划分配为主的办法，部分毕业生到社会上去了解需求信息是可以的，但不是让他们去“自谋职业”。在社会上“自谋职业”的机制尚未建立的情况下，毕业生去“自谋职业”会遇到很多困难和问题，会造成学生、家长和社会的误解和不安。
    针对上述问题，国家教委发言人指出：一定要认真贯彻国家有关分配工作的方针政策，增加分配工作的透明度，加强社会监督；各地和用人单位要用长远观点看待由于经济整顿以及分配工作和人事、劳动制度改革不配套而带来的暂时困难，以负责的态度积极吸收毕业生，并妥善安排他们的工作。学校、学生和用人单位都不应把“学用一致”的原则理解过窄，应根据社会的实际需要拓宽分配去向。要动员一批理科和文史等科类毕业生到中学任教，国家将采取相应的措施予以鼓励。
