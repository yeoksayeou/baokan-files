In recent years, the growth rate of per capita expenditure on books and magazines has been significantly lower than the growth rate of other living expenses, and its proportion has been continuously decreasing. According to a survey: In 1988, the per capita expenditure on books and magazines in Xi'an was only 9.23 yuan, and the proportion of living expenses decreased from 1.7% in 1980 to 0.9% in 1987. In 1988, the per capita expenditure on books and magazines in Panzhihua, Liaoning Province, was only 2.08 yuan, a decrease of 6.3% compared to 1987.

The main reasons for this phenomenon are:

1. The prices of books and magazines have increased.
2. There is a bias in residents' consumption choices. In recent years, the focus of consumption for most residents has been on purchasing large durable consumer goods and high-nutrition foods such as meat, milk, eggs, and poultry.
3. Influenced by the unhealthy trends in society, some high-income individuals flaunt their wealth and status in material life but have a spiritually impoverished life.
4. The income of mental labor is lower than that of physical labor. The main consumers with high income do not necessarily have high cultural and technical qualifications, and they may not have an urgent need for books and magazines.

Experts are deeply concerned about the decrease or relative reduction in book and magazine expenditure. This is related to the current resurgence of the theory that reading is useless.

### 书报杂志消费支出减少堪忧

　　书报杂志消费支出减少堪忧
    近几年来，人均用于购买书报杂志支出的增长速度明显低于生活费其它支出的增长，所占比重不断下降。据调查：西安市１９８８年人均书报杂志支出仅为９．２３元，占生活费支出的比重由１９８０年的１．７％降至１９８７年的０．９％；辽宁省盘锦市１９８８年人均用于书报杂志的支出仅为２．０８元，比１９８７年下降６．３％。
    造成这种现象的原因主要是：
    １、书报杂志价格上涨。
    ２、居民消费选择偏差。近几年来，大多数居民消费选择的热点集中在购买大件耐用消费品和肉奶蛋禽等高营养食品。
    ３、受社会上的不正之风的影响，某些收入高的人在物质生活上摆阔气、讲排场，在精神生活方面却空虚贫乏。
    ４、脑力劳动和体力劳动收入倒挂，高收入的消费主体，并不一定具有较高文化技术素质，对书报杂志也不一定有迫切的需求。
    有关专家对书报杂志费用支出减少或相对降低深表忧虑。这与当前新的读书无用论不无联系。
