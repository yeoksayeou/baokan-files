Title: How Strict Control Turned into Uncontrolled

Strict control of private cars is in place, with the purchase of a car requiring approval through planned allocation, purchase control, registration, and financial review. However, how did the 451 cars purchased illegally in Guizhou manage to bypass all these controls, turning strict control into uncontrolled?

In theory, there is strict control, but in practice, the control is not strict. Those in charge of planned allocation leave a significant amount of leeway; the purchase control departments do not enforce the controls, and cars purchased outside the plan are approved without issue; vehicle management units register cars regardless of whether they have purchase control approval; and financial management departments turn a blind eye to the misuse of special funds, loans, and credit. Each checkpoint fails to do its job.

Why is the control not strict? It turns out that those who want cars are so eager to have them that they lose their judgment; those who sell cars profit from the illegal trade, so they seize the opportunity; those who want cars and those who sell them use both soft and hard tactics, threats and inducements, to attack those in charge of the checkpoints from all sides. It is difficult for the checkpoints to hold. Of course, the checkpoints also fail because those in charge are not firm. As a result, despite all the "strict control" regulations, it remains uncontrolled.

The lack of strict control reflects a broader issue of poor party discipline and social ethics. Addressing this problem requires a multi-faceted approach. Guizhou Province is currently investigating the issue of illegal car purchases. How they "investigate" and "handle" the issue is not mentioned. The fear is that the violators will still be happy with the outcome.

People repeatedly call for strict enforcement of laws and regulations, as the failure to do so has become a serious problem. If punishments and penalties are not "serious" and "strict" enough to deter others, then no matter how many regulations there are, they will not be effective.

### 严控如何又失控

　　严控如何又失控
　　杜若
    小汽车是严控商品，买一辆车，要经过计划分配、控购、上户、购买资金审查等一道道严关，那么，贵州查出的那451辆违纪购买的小汽车，又是如何斩将过关，使严控变成失控的呢？
    说是严控，实际是控而不严。搞计划分配的留出了数量可观的机动数；控购部门不控购，计划外购车照批不误；车辆管理单位，不管有无控购批准手续，照上车牌；而财经管理部门，对挪用专款、借款和贷款也是眼睁眼闭地放行。一关一关都把丢了。
    为什么控而不严呢？原来，先是那些想坐车的头头脑脑们，想车想迷了；那些倒车的，本来靠“倒来倒去”吃饭，于是有机可乘；想坐车的、倒车的，软硬兼施，威诱并用，里里外外一起去攻那些“把关的”，这关便难把难守。当然，丢了关，也是“把关的”自身不硬气。结果，纵有“严控”种种规定，依旧是个“失控”。
    严控不严，是党风、社会风气不正的综合反映，治理也要多方设法。贵州省对违纪购买小汽车问题正在查处，怎样“查”，怎样“处”，消息没有说。怕只怕，违纪者依然皆大欢喜。
    人们屡屡呼吁：有法有规不依已成为严重问题，治理整顿需要动真格的。如果惩罚、处理得“认真”、“严肃”仍不足以儆效尤，那么规定再多也是不能起到作用的。
