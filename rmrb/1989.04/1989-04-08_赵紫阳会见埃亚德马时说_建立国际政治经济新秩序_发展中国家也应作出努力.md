Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 7th.

Zhao Ziyang, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, exchanged views with Eyadema, the founder and chairman of the People's Union of Togo and the President of the Republic of Togo, this afternoon at Zhongnanhai on the establishment of a new international political and economic order.

Zhao Ziyang said that currently, the general trend in international affairs is towards easing tensions. The changes in the international situation provide opportunities and possibilities for the development of developing countries. However, problems will not be solved automatically, and significant efforts are still needed. Developing countries should cherish these opportunities and study how to use them to solve the development issues of developing countries. Domestically, they should maintain a stable and united political situation, and economically, they need flexible and practical policies.

He further elaborated that developing countries must have a favorable external environment to develop themselves, which means they need a favorable international environment. Currently, we need to establish a new international political order based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Historical practice has proven that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are the most vital. The easing of international relations will not automatically produce a new international political order. Only through the joint efforts of the Third World and all justice-seeking countries can a new order be established.

He said that while establishing a new international political order, we must also establish a new international economic order. Developed countries have a responsibility to help developing countries and change the situation where the poor become poorer and the rich become richer. We developing countries should also make our own efforts to establish a new international economic order.

Zhao Ziyang expressed his appreciation for President Eyadema's domestic and foreign policies since taking office and stated that the Communist Party of China and the people highly value the friendship between the two countries.

President Eyadema reported on some of the methods and achievements of Togo in actively mediating conflicts and disputes among African countries. Togo calls on the international community to take appropriate measures to solve this crucial issue. He expressed satisfaction with the smooth development of bilateral relations between Togo and China.

　　赵紫阳会见埃亚德马时说
    建立国际政治经济新秩序  发展中国家也应作出努力
    本报北京四月七日讯  记者温宪报道：中共中央总书记赵紫阳今天下午在中南海就建立国际政治、经济新秩序等问题同多哥人民联盟创始人、主席、共和国总统埃亚德马交换了看法。
    赵紫阳说，当前，国际局势总的趋势是走向缓和。国际局势的变化为我们发展中国家的发展提供了机会与可能。但问题不可能自动解决，还要做出很大努力。发展中国家应珍视这种机会，研究如何利用这个机会解决发展中国家的发展问题。在国内应保持安定团结的政治局面，经济上则需要有灵活和符合实际的政策。
    他进一步阐述说，发展中国家要发展自己必须要有一个有利的外部条件，也就是要有一个有利的国际环境。当前，我们需要在和平共处五项原则基础上建立国际政治新秩序。历史的实践证明，和平共处五项原则最富有生命力。国际关系的缓和不会使国际政治新秩序自动产生，第三世界和一切主持正义的国家共同努力，新秩序才能建立起来。
    他说，在建立国际政治新秩序的同时，还要建立国际经济新秩序。发达国家有责任帮助发展中国家，要改变穷国愈穷、富国愈富的状况。我们发展中国家也应为建立国际经济新秩序做出自己的努力。
    赵紫阳对埃亚德马总统执政以来的内外政策表示赞赏，并表示中国共产党和人民十分珍视两国友谊。
    埃亚德马总统通报了多哥积极调解非洲国家间矛盾和争端中的一些作法及取得的成果。多哥呼吁国际社会采取妥善办法解决这一至关重要的问题。他对多中双边关系的顺利发展表示满意。
