The six frontline states of Africa held a meeting today in Luanda to discuss ways to resolve the increasingly tense situation in northern Namibia. The meeting called for South Africa and the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) to immediately cease military hostilities in northern Namibia. It also urged the United Nations Security Council to pay serious attention to the armed conflicts there and take effective measures promptly.

The presidents of Angola, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, and Tanzania held a secret meeting at the presidential palace at 2 p.m. The chairman of SWAPO, Nujoma, and the chairman of the African National Congress of South Africa, Tambo, also attended the meeting.

After the meeting, the six frontline state leaders held a joint press conference. Angolan President Dos Santos pointed out at the meeting that Angola condemns the military conflict between South Africa and SWAPO because this incident seriously threatens Namibia's independence process and the New York agreements signed by the relevant parties. He emphasized that the most important thing now is not to determine who fired the first shot, but to immediately stop military hostilities. He called on the United Nations and the frontline states to exert influence on South Africa and SWAPO to achieve an immediate ceasefire. Dos Santos said that after the ceasefire, SWAPO's forces in Namibia should hand over their weapons to the assistance team and stay in their camps.

　　探讨解决纳米比亚北部局势办法
    非洲前线六国首脑紧急磋商
    要求立即停止武装冲突　呼吁联合国采取有力措施
    据新华社罗安达４月６日电  （记者赵晓钟）６个非洲前线国家的首脑今天在罗安达举行了会议，讨论解决日益紧张的纳米比亚北部局势的办法。会议要求南非和西南非洲人民组织（西南非人组）立即停止纳米比亚北部的军事敌对行动，同时呼吁联合国安理会认真关注那里的武装冲突事件，及时采取有力措施。
    安哥拉总统多斯桑托斯、莫桑比克总统希萨诺、津巴布韦总统穆加贝、赞比亚总统卡翁达、博茨瓦纳总统马西雷和坦桑尼亚总统姆维尼下午两点在总统府举行秘密会议。西南非人组主席努乔马和南非非洲人国民大会主席坦博也出席了会议。
    会议结束后，６个前线国家的元首联合举行了记者招待会。安哥拉总统多斯桑托斯在会议上指出，安哥拉谴责南非与西南非人组的军事冲突，因为这一事件严重威胁纳米比亚的独立进程和有关各方签署的纽约协议。他强调，目前最重要的不是弄清谁开第一枪，而是立即停止军事敌对行动。他要求联合国和前线国家向南非和西南非人组施加影响，使它们立即实现停火。多斯桑托斯说，停火后，西南非人组在纳米比亚境内的部队应向援助团交出武器，并呆在营地内。
