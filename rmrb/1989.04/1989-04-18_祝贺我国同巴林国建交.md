Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 18th.

In order to strengthen and develop friendly cooperation between the two countries, the People's Republic of China and the State of Bahrain have decided to establish diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial level starting from April 18, 1989. This will open up new prospects for the development of relations between the two countries, and we extend our warm congratulations on this occasion.

Bahrain, located on the eastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula, is a jewel in the center of the Gulf. Since gaining independence in 1971, the Bahraini government has pursued a policy of economic diversification, actively developing agriculture, tourism, and the financial sector in addition to the oil industry. With its advantageous geographical location and advanced transportation and communication facilities, Bahrain has become a financial hub in the Middle East. In its foreign relations, Bahrain adheres to a policy of neutrality and non-alignment, paying attention to maintaining the unity of the Arab world and good neighborly relations among the Gulf countries, and insisting on the principles of respecting national sovereignty, non-interference in internal affairs, non-use of force, and resolving disputes between countries through peaceful means. Bahrain's foreign policy and principles have been widely praised by the international community.

China has always advocated that all countries, big or small, should be equal, respect each other, and cooperate in friendship. In 1971, Premier Zhou Enlai sent a telegram to the Emir of Bahrain to congratulate Bahrain on its independence. In recent years, trade and friendly exchanges between the two countries have been increasing. We sincerely hope that the two countries will further develop friendly relations on the basis of mutual respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and in accordance with the principles of peaceful coexistence, equality, and non-interference in internal affairs.

　　祝贺我国同巴林国建交
    从巩固和发展两国友好合作关系的愿望出发，中华人民共和国和巴林国决定自１９８９年４月１８日起建立大使级外交关系。这将为两国关系的发展开辟新的前景，我们对此表示热烈祝贺。
    位于阿拉伯半岛东岸的巴林国是海湾中部的一颗明珠。１９７１年独立以来，巴林政府在经济发展中奉行多样化政策，除石油工业外，还积极发展农业、旅游业和金融业。目前，有着优越地理位置和先进交通、通讯设施的巴林已成为中东地区的金融中心。在对外关系中，巴林奉行中立、不结盟的外交政策，注意维护阿拉伯世界的团结和海湾各国间的睦邻关系，坚持尊重国家主权、不干涉内政、不诉诸武力和以和平方式解决国与国之间争端的原则。巴林的对外政策和主张受到了国际社会普遍赞赏。
    中国一贯主张大小国家应一律平等，互相尊重，友好合作。１９７１年，周恩来总理曾致电巴林埃米尔，祝贺巴林独立。近年来，两国间贸易和友好往来不断增加。我们衷心祝愿两国在互相尊重国家主权和领土完整的基础上，按照和平共处、平等和不干涉内政等原则进一步发展友好关系。
