Some units and individuals have embezzled public funds and refused to pay road maintenance fees and vehicle purchase surcharges. Hubei Province has failed to collect over 100 million yuan.

	New China News Agency, Wuhan, April 19 — According to statistics from the Hubei Provincial Road Maintenance Fee Collection Bureau, Hubei Province failed to collect 54 million yuan in road maintenance fees and 50 million yuan in vehicle purchase surcharges last year, totaling 1.04 billion yuan in uncollected fees. Most of this money ended up in the pockets of individual and contracted transportation operators, while some went to certain units.

	The main reason for the uncollected fees is severe tax evasion and resistance to payment. Some units and individuals with vehicles use various methods and tactics to evade and resist paying road maintenance fees: those who pay road maintenance fees based on operating income hide or underreport their income, maintain two sets of accounts, one for internal use and another to pass inspections; some alter or borrow road maintenance fee certificates, falsely using someone else's name; some units change the original use of their vehicles, and vehicles used for business do not go through the payment process; some vehicles are reported as "stopped" but continue to operate, or reported as "scrapped" but are not actually scrapped, thus evading road maintenance fees.

	Traffic fee collection personnel face numerous difficulties in on-road inspections, which is another important factor affecting the collection of road maintenance fees. The traffic fee collection department is burdened with the heavy task of collecting road maintenance fees, but lacks the authority to inspect vehicles on the road or detain vehicles that evade fees. This allows some fee evasion behaviors, although discovered, to go unchecked and unpunished. Some drivers, when found without road maintenance fee and surcharge payment certificates, not only do not admit their mistakes or pay the fees, but also use foul language, fists, and feet to insult, surround, and assault the collection personnel, ultimately driving the vehicles away by force.

### 一些单位个人损公肥私　抗缴养路费购车附加费　湖北漏征上亿元

　　湖北漏征上亿元
    新华社武汉４月１９日电　（记者李桂生）据湖北省公路养路费征稽局统计，去年湖北省公路养路费漏征５４００多万元，车辆购置附加费漏征５０００多万元，“两费”共计漏征１．０４亿元。这些钱大部分装入了运输个体户和承包经营户的腰包，一部分“肥”了某些单位。
    漏征“两费”的原因是偷漏抗费严重。一些有车单位和个人，采取多种形式和手法，偷漏、抗缴养路费：按营运收入缴纳养路费的，有的隐瞒和少报营运收入，搞两套帐，对内一套帐，对外应付检查一套帐；有的涂改、转借养路费凭证，“张冠李戴”冒名顶替；有的有车单位改变原来使用性质，参加经营的车辆不办缴费手续；有的车辆报“停”不停，报“废”不废，逃缴养路费。
    交通征费人员上路稽查困难重重，也是影响养路费堵漏增收的一个重要原因。交通征费部门担任繁重的公路养路费征稽任务，但却无权上路查车和无权扣留抗费车辆，使一些偷漏养路费行为虽然被发现，却得不到及时和有效地制止。还有的驾驶员被检查出无养路费和附加费交纳凭证，不但不承认错误，补交费用，甚至恶语相加，拳脚并使，辱骂、围攻、殴打征稽人员，最后强行把车开走。
