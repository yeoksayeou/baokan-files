Xinhua News Agency, March 24th. The housing reform scheme of "mortgaging and leasing, using interest to cover rent" at the Taoyuan Aluminum Factory, reported by this newspaper on March 24th, is simple and practical, attracting the attention and interest of readers from various places. More than 30 housing reform departments from 11 provinces and municipalities, including Inner Mongolia, Hunan, and Sichuan, have written letters or sent people to Taoyuan Aluminum Factory to inquire about the details.

Housing reform departments and industrial and mining enterprises in various places believe that the scheme of Taoyuan Aluminum Factory is a new attempt. It is simple and practical, and workers can afford it. For specific problems encountered in adopting this housing reform scheme, different places can adopt different methods to solve them. Factory director Yang Wenfu said: When determining the mortgage amount, consideration should be given to the geographical location of the housing, the level of the housing, the newness, and the internal facilities. The mortgage amount must be deposited in the bank as a time deposit, otherwise, it will lead to a "vicious cycle." Mortgaging and leasing do not exclude selling houses. Yang Wenfu said: "When the income of the majority of workers has significantly increased, then it is possible to appropriately charge for selling the ownership of the houses in stages, gradually realizing private ownership of housing."

　　良性循环　简便易行    
    太原铝材厂房改引起关注
    本报讯  本报３月２４日报道的太原铝材厂“抵押出租，以息代租”的房改方案简便易行，引起各地读者的关注和兴趣。内蒙古、湖南、四川等１１个省、区（市）的３０多家房改部门致函或派人到太原铝材厂询问详情。
    各地的房改部门、工矿企事业单位，认为太原铝材厂这套方案是一个新尝试。简便易行，职工可以承受。采用这套房改方案中遇到的具体问题，各地可以采取不同方法去解决。太原铝材厂厂长杨文福说：在确定抵押金时，要考虑到住宅的地理位置、住宅的等级、新旧程度及内部设施等。抵押金必须作为定期存款存入银行，否则就会造成“恶性循环”。抵押出租不排斥卖房。杨文福说：“等到大多数职工的收入确有较大增长，那时，可以适当收费出卖住房所有权，分步实现住房私有。”
