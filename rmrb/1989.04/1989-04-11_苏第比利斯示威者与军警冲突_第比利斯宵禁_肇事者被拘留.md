On the night of April 8, protesters in Tbilisi, the capital of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, clashed with police and military personnel maintaining order. A curfew was imposed in Tbilisi.

According to TASS, among the protesters in front of the Georgian government building, some shouted slogans calling for the overthrow of the Soviet government, the establishment of a provisional government, and secession from the Soviet Union. After efforts by Georgian leaders, religious figures, and prominent individuals to dissuade them failed, the Georgian leadership decided to forcibly disperse the gathering and clear the crowd in front of the building.

TASS reported that the police and military personnel executing the task did not use weapons, but a few extremists resisted with stones and clubs. In the chaos, 16 people died, dozens were injured, and 75 police and military personnel were injured. Georgia has established a government committee to investigate the causes of the tragedy. The square is now under military control, and some rioters have been detained.

At the end of last month, thousands of people gathered in the Abkhaz Autonomous Republic within Georgia, demanding that Abkhazia become a union republic and secede from Georgia. This was opposed by the Georgian leadership, and the First Secretary of the Abkhaz Party Committee was dismissed for mishandling the ethnic dispute. In recent days, Tbilisi has seen continuous gatherings and marches demanding punishment for those who instigated the ethnic conflict in Abkhazia at the end of last month.

Georgia is one of the three union republics in the South Caucasus of the Soviet Union. The other two union republics, Armenia and Azerbaijan, had their social unrest caused by ethnic disputes only recently quelled.

　　苏第比利斯示威者与军警冲突
　　第比利斯宵禁　肇事者被拘留
    新华社莫斯科４月９日电　４月８日深夜，苏联格鲁吉亚首都第比利斯的示威者同维持秩序的民警和军人发生冲突，第比利斯实行宵禁。
    据塔斯社报道，在格鲁吉亚政府大楼前示威的人中，有人呼喊推翻苏维埃政权和建立临时政府、脱离苏联的口号。共和国领导、教会首领和知名人士劝阻无效后，格鲁吉亚领导决定强行制止集会，驱散楼前广场上的人群。
    塔斯社说，执行任务的民警和军人没有使用武器，但少数极端分子用石块和棍棒反抗，在拥挤中死１６人，伤几十人，军人和民警有７５人受伤。格鲁吉亚已成立政府委员会调查惨案原因。广场由军人控制，少数肇事者被拘留。
    上月底，格鲁吉亚境内的阿布哈兹自治共和国数千人集会，要求阿布哈兹成为加盟共和国，脱离格鲁吉亚、遭到格鲁吉亚领导反对，阿布哈兹党委第一书记因处理民族纠纷不力被撤职。近几天，第比利斯不断集会和游行，要求惩办上月底在阿布哈兹挑起民族纠纷的人。
    格鲁吉亚是苏联南高加索３个加盟共和国之一。另两个加盟共和国亚美尼亚和阿塞拜疆去年由民族纠纷引起的社会动乱不久前才被平息。
