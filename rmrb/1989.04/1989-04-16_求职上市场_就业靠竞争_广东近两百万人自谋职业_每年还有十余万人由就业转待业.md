Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 16th — After a decade of reform, Guangdong Province's labor employment system has begun to take shape, with a labor market mechanism gradually forming. People's awareness of job competition and unemployment risks is steadily increasing.

Statistics show that since the establishment of Guangdong Province's Labor Service Company in 1979, 3.9 million urban unemployed individuals have been placed in jobs, accounting for 96.5% of the total urban unemployed population in the province. Among these, 1.97 million people have found jobs independently without relying on state recruitment or allocation, making up 50.5% of the total employed population. In the more economically developed Pearl River Delta region, this figure exceeds 60%.

These individuals who have found jobs independently are facilitated through labor market intermediaries. In recent years, Guangdong has established 2,699 labor service companies and 194 labor intermediaries. They have organized 45 labor exchange fairs, with over 1,500 employers and more than 300,000 job seekers participating. Additionally, social organizations have set up various job introduction agencies such as "Household Labor Service Companies," "Youth Labor Information Service Centers," and "Worker Technical Cooperation and Exchange Centers." As a result, the rational flow of labor between different job positions has become more common. Each year, the number of people transitioning from employment to unemployment reaches over 100,000, accounting for about one-quarter to one-third of the annual employment placements.

The gradual formation of the labor market mechanism has enhanced people's awareness of job competition, prompting them to actively participate in pre-employment vocational training to strengthen their competitiveness. Over the past decade, 1.36 million people in the province have undergone pre-employment technical training.

　　求职上市场　就业靠竞争
　　广东近两百万人自谋职业
　　每年还有十余万人由就业转待业
    新华社广州４月１6日电　（记者翁作祥、通讯员曾碧忠）广东省劳动就业制度经过１０年改革，已初步形成了劳动就业市场机制，人们的职业竞争观念和失业风险观念正在日益增强。
    据统计，广东省劳动服务公司自１９７９年成立以来，已安排城镇待业人员就业３９０万人，占全省城镇待业总人数的９６．５％，其中不靠国家招工和分配自谋职业的达１９７万人，占安置就业总人数的５０．５％，经济较发达的珠江三角洲高达６０％以上。
    这些不靠国家招工就业的待业人员，是通过劳务市场中介实现的。近年来，广东相继成立２６９９个劳动服务公司，１９４个劳务中介机构。他们先后开办４５次劳务交流会，有１５００多个用人单位和３０多万劳动者参加交流。此外，还有社会团体开办的“家务劳动服务公司”、“青年劳务信息服务中心”、“工人技术协作和交流中心”等职业介绍机构。因而，劳动力在不同就业岗位之间合理流动日趋普遍。全省每年由就业转待业的人数达１０万人以上，约占当年安置就业人数的１／４到１／３。
    劳动就业市场机制的逐步形成，提高了人们的就业竞争观念，促使人们积极参加就业前的职业技术培训，以增强就业竞争力。１０年来，全省经过就业前技术培训的人数达１３６万人。
