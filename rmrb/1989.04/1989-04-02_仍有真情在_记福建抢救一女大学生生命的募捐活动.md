There Is Still Genuine Affection
—Recording the Fundraising Campaign to Save a Female College Student in Fujian

On March 6, the student union of Xiamen University received a letter seeking help. The letter was written by a peasant from Hebei. His daughter, Xu Shuyan, was a student in the Foreign Languages Department of the university and was being treated for kidney disease in a hospital in Beijing. She needed a kidney transplant, which would cost over 70,000 yuan.

On March 8, the student union and the Foreign Languages Department of Xiamen University issued a "Call for Donations for Xu Shuyan." The fundraising campaign first took place within the campus and the city of Xiamen, and then expanded to the entire province of Fujian through news media. On the day of the fundraising, over 3,500 yuan was collected within the campus of Xiamen University alone. The donation boxes contained not only various denominations of cash but also grain coupons, meal tickets, manuscript fees, dormitory electricity-saving rewards, and even books, cassette tapes, and thermos bottles...

Students from the Department of Electronic Engineering repaired electrical appliances for the fundraising, students from the Department of History sold books and newspapers at the book exchange center, and students from the Journalism Department took charge of the publicity and reporting of the fundraising activities.

Two young people from Taiwan donated 200 New Taiwan dollars and 100 yuan respectively, and then donated a delivery voucher for a Yamaha 125 motorcycle worth around 10,000 yuan. The Xiamen Auction House provided free auction services for them, and the *Xiamen Daily* and Xiamen Television Station provided free auction advertisements.

Comrades attending the Party Building Conference in Yong'an City saw the report in the *Fujian Daily* and made a special resolution to launch a city-wide fundraising campaign. Recently, the city sent a telegram to Xiamen University: the first batch of 11,350 yuan in donations will be remitted soon.

On the morning of March 27, the reporter called to inquire about the total amount of donations collected by the Foreign Languages Department of Xiamen University. The information received was: the total amount had exceeded 55,000 yuan.

Of course, it is not necessary to hide the other side of society's attitude. "Isn't the treatment of college students covered by the state? Why are they still asking us for money?" someone asked with puzzled eyes. When a small hand took out warm money from a pocket and approached the donation box, another hand was pulled back by parents, followed by a scolding, "Fool!" There were also such sneering laughs, "Hey! Look at these decent beggars!"

　　仍有真情在
    ——记福建抢救一女大学生生命的募捐活动
    本报记者  张铭清
    ３月６日，厦门大学学生会收到了一封求援信。信，出自一位河北农民之手。他的女儿许淑燕是该校外文系学生，因患肾病在北京一家医院治疗。她要作肾脏移植手术，需７万多元费用。
    ３月８日，厦大学生会、外文系学生会向全校发出“为许淑燕同学募捐倡议书”。募捐活动先是在厦大校园内、厦门市，继而通过新闻媒介在福建全省展开。募捐当天，就在厦大校内收到３５００多元。捐款箱里，不但有各种票额的现金，还有粮票、饭菜票、稿费单、宿舍节电奖励单，甚至有书、磁带和热水瓶……
    电子工程系的学生为募捐义修电器，历史系学生图书交流中心义卖书报，新闻系同学则承包了募捐活动的宣传报道。
    两位台湾青年，一位捐了２００元新台币，一位捐了１００元人民币后，又捐了一台价值万把元的雅马哈１２５型摩托车的提货单。厦门拍卖行免费为他们拍卖，《厦门日报》、厦门电视台免费作拍卖广告。
    正在参加永安市委党建会议的同志看到《福建日报》报道，作特别决议发动全市募捐。近日，该市给厦大发去电报：第一批１１３５０元捐款随后汇到。
    ３月２７日上午，记者打电话询问厦大外文系募捐款数，得到的信息是：总数已超过５．５万元。
    当然，没有必要掩饰社会另一面的心态。“大学生治病，不是国家包了吗？干嘛还来向我们要钱？”有人瞪着疑惑的眼睛。当一只小手从口袋里摸出带体温的钱走近募捐箱时，另一只手却被父母拖回，接着是“傻瓜”一声呵斥。“嘿！看看这些体面乞丐！”也有这样睥睨的冷笑。
