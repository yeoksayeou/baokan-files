Tense, Intense, and Beautiful
—A Report on the Swedish Table Tennis Team's Battle Against the South Korean Team

Yesterday afternoon, the most captivating match in the men's team event at the World Table Tennis Championships was between the Swedish team, which had won the world runner-up title for three consecutive times, and the strong South Korean team.

The Swedish team used Appelgren for the 1st, 5th, and 9th matches, Waldner for the 2nd, 4th, and 7th matches, and Lindh for the remaining three matches. Appelgren first defeated Kim Kyu-Jae with a score of 2:0. Waldner then defeated Kim Jae-Hyun with a score of 2:1, giving the Swedish team a 2:0 lead right from the start and establishing a psychological advantage over the South Korean team. The South Korean team, known for their strong table tennis skills, fought back fiercely. In the 3rd match, Ryu Seung-Min performed exceptionally well, with almost flawless reactions, judgments, and actions, winning 2:1 to narrow the gap to 1:2. In the 4th match, Kim Kyu-Jae won 2:1, bringing the score to 2:2. The atmosphere became tense. In the 5th match, Ryu Seung-Min seemed too eager to win, lacking patience, and made several mistakes in judging the ball's trajectory in the 3rd set, ultimately losing 1:2 to Appelgren of Sweden. In the 6th match, Lindh lost 1:2 to Kim Jae-Hyun, tying the score again. In the 7th match, Waldner won 2:1 against Ryu Seung-Min. In the 8th match, Kim Kyu-Jae won 2:0 against Lindh, not only avenging the 1st match but also tying the score at 4:4, putting immense pressure on Appelgren and Kim Jae-Hyun, who were to play the decisive 9th match. Appelgren, bearing the heavy responsibility of the Swedish team, took the court. In the first set, Appelgren did not adapt well and lost 15:21. Remarkably, Appelgren remained calm and collected, taking the lead in the second set by scoring three consecutive points, keeping Kim Jae-Hyun from taking the lead, and ultimately winning 21:12. In the decisive third set, Appelgren capitalized on his momentum, winning 21:17 against Kim Jae-Hyun. The Swedish team excitedly jumped up to embrace Appelgren, who had achieved a great victory.

　　紧张激烈漂亮
    ——瑞典乒乓球队激战南朝鲜队纪实
    本报多特蒙德４月１日电  昨天下午世乒赛男子团体赛最吸引人的是蝉联三届世界亚军的瑞典队和劲旅南朝鲜队之战。
    瑞典队用阿佩伊伦打第１、第５、第９盘，瓦尔德内尔第２、第４、第７盘，林德打余下的３盘。阿佩伊伦先以２∶０战胜金琦泽。瓦尔德内尔又以２∶１胜金泽洙，场上形成２∶０的瑞典优势，一开始就为瑞典队打下心理上压倒对方的基础。南朝鲜不愧为乒乓劲旅，猛起直追，第３盘刘南奎表现不凡，从反应、判断直到行动几乎无懈可击，以２∶１扳回１分，第４盘金琦泽以２∶１再为南朝鲜立了一功。场上出现２∶２平局。气氛顿时紧张起来。第５盘刘南奎显得急于求成，耐心不够，到了第３局判断球路时连连失误，终以１∶２败于瑞典的阿佩伊伦。第６盘林德以１∶２又败于金泽洙，场上再次出现平局。第７盘瓦尔德内尔以２∶１胜刘南奎，到了第８盘金琦泽以２∶０胜林德，不仅复了第１盘的一箭之仇，而且把场上比分打成４∶４，直接给定江山第９盘出场的阿佩伊伦和金泽洙形成巨大压力。阿佩伊伦肩负瑞典队重托出场。第１局开始阿佩伊伦不太适应，以１５∶２１输了第１局。难能可贵的是阿佩伊伦竟能不慌不乱，第２局上来就连拿３分压住阵脚，金泽洙始终没能领先，以１２∶２１负于阿佩伊伦。在决战的第３局，阿佩伊伦乘胜追击，以２１∶１７胜金泽洙。瑞典队激动地跳起来拥抱立下赫赫战功的阿佩伊伦。
