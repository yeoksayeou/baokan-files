Tan: From the current state of miscellaneous writings, it seems that miscellaneous writings, especially those in the style of Lu Xun, are increasingly popular. Authors are willing to write, and readers are willing to read. Especially in newspapers and magazines, miscellaneous writings have become an indispensable and important genre for invigorating the mind. This does not seem to be something that can be controlled by an individual. What do you think are the main reasons for this?

Tang: This phenomenon is not accidental. On one hand, there are indeed bad phenomena in society such as corruption and improper tendencies, and we lack sufficient democratic channels and mechanisms, so we can only rely on the form of miscellaneous writings to express ourselves. Because miscellaneous writings have a critical and combative nature, they were originally separated from essays and became an independent genre, not just the subjective wish of an individual—such as Lu Xun's advocacy—but rather the objective need of the struggle. Sharp or hidden struggles exist, and merely expressing emotions or narrating events is not enough. What is needed is to comment on life in an artistic way. Thus, miscellaneous writings emerged.

Tan: In fact, now miscellaneous writings have far exceeded their capacity: justice, conscience, supervision, enlightenment, personality... all are included. This indeed puts a lot of pressure on miscellaneous writings.

Tang: This is precisely a characteristic of miscellaneous writings in the new period. This is also a manifestation of the strengthening of the subjectivity of Chinese intellectuals. In the past, intellectuals were treated as appendages, as the saying goes, "When the skin is gone, the hair will scatter." Now, as part of the working class, they begin to think independently. They write miscellaneous writings because they have something to say and opinions to express. Therefore, they dare to assert their individuality and dare to speak out in times of prosperity. As a result, they achieve self-realization. Readers naturally want to hear the truth and also appreciate the display of their humanity and personality.

Tan: China is a country with a long tradition of essays. From ancient times to the present, famous essays are countless. What do you think are the characteristics of new period essays in this sequence?

Tang: The prominent feature of new period essays is that they write from the heart, which actually solves the problem that has been repeatedly mentioned in ancient Chinese literary criticism: whether to create literature for emotions or to create emotions for literature. This is evident when comparing works from before the Cultural Revolution. A considerable part of them are reflections on the past ten years, and none of them are not genuine expressions of emotion. Therefore, I agree with Wang Ruoshui's point: the highest standard of literature is truth.

Tan: You mentioned earlier that new period essays have made breakthroughs, but not as prominent as miscellaneous writings. Please talk specifically about this issue.

Tang: The achievements of new period essays are remarkable and evident to all; but there are still some shortcomings, that is, in the diversification of forms, it seems to be insufficient. We have mostly inherited and carried forward the tradition of Lu Xun's essays, while we have studied and researched the essays of Zhou Zuoren, Zhu Ziqing, and Feng Zikai less. Therefore, it is difficult to see the influence of these several essay masters in the works of contemporary people. Only in Huang Shang's works can we see a bit of Zhou Zuoren's shadow, and in Yang Rong's works, a bit of Feng Zikai's shadow. Apart from this, it is basically one path, which needs to be explored.

Tan: The elderly Ms. Bing Xin and you, as committee members, did not participate in the selection of your own works. People admire the noble character of the committee members.

Tang: It is only natural. I firmly advocate that committee members do not evaluate their own works and do not mutually recommend each other. In the selection, we try our best to be fair; but I have to say, there are inevitably some pearls lost in the sea. As one of the leaders of the committee, I feel regretful about this.

### 我观新时期散文和杂文——访唐弢

　　我观新时期散文和杂文    
    ——访唐弢
    谭健
    谭：从当前杂文的现状来看，杂文，尤其是鲁迅笔法的杂文，越来越受到人们的欢迎，作者愿意写读者愿意看，尤其是报刊，杂文成了提神醒脑不可或缺的重要品种之一。这似乎不是某个人所能左右的，您认为其中的主要原因是什么？
    唐：这种现象不是偶然的。一方面是因为社会上的确存在诸如贪污腐败、不正之风等坏现象，而我们又缺少充分的民主渠道和机制，也就只好借助杂文这种形式来发言了。因为杂文具有批判性和战斗性，它最早从散文中分离出来，而作为一种独立的文体，不是某个人——比如鲁迅的倡导——的主观愿望，而是客观斗争的需要，尖锐或隐蔽的斗争存在着，光是抒抒情，叙叙事，已经不够了，需要的是针对生活，艺术性地发议论，杂文便应运而生。
    谭：实际上，现在的杂文，其负荷已远远超过了它的载体：正义、良知、监督、启蒙、人格……都包容其中了，这也着实难为了杂文。
    唐：这正是新时期杂文的一个特点，这也是中国知识分子主体意识增强的表现，过去把知识分子当附属物，所谓“皮之不存，毛将焉附？”现在作为工人阶级，他们开始独立思考了，他们写杂文是因为有话要讲，有意见要发表，因此，敢于张扬个性，敢于发表盛世危言，由此，实现自我。读者自然愿意听真话，也赏识他们的人性和人格力量的展示。
    谭：中国是一个具有悠久传统的散文国度，自古及今，脍炙人口的散文可谓汗牛充栋，您认为新时期散文在这个序列中具有什么特点？
    唐：新时期散文的突出特点是写心，实际上是解决了中国古代文论中曾反复提到的为情造文，还是为文造情的问题，这只要比较一下文革以前的作品就很清楚了。其中有相当一部分是反思十年的作品，无一不是真情的流露。因此，我同意王若水同志的一个观点：文学的最高标准就是真实。
    谭：你在前面提到新时期散文有突破，但不如杂文突出，请你具体谈谈这个问题。
    唐：新时期散文成绩斐然，有目共睹；但也还有不足的地方，那就是在形式的多元化方面似乎还不够，我们大都是继承发扬了鲁迅散文的传统，而对周作人、朱自清、丰子恺的散文学习研究得较少，因此，我们很难从今人的作品中看到这几位散文大家的影响，只有在黄裳的作品中看到一点周作人的影子，从杨绛的作品中看到一点丰子恺的影子。舍此便大体是一个路子，这有待开拓。
    谭：冰心老人和您因担任评委而自己的作品未参加评选，人们对评委们这种高尚的情操表示敬佩。
    唐：理所应当。我坚持主张：评委不评自己的作品和互相推举。评选中，我们尽量做到公正；但我要说，沧海遗珠，在所难免，作为评委的牵头者之一，我对此颇感遗憾。
