The statue of "Lone Hero" Yuan Long, a martyr, was recently unveiled in his hometown of Jinghong County, Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province. In the past few days, over 4,000 locals and border defense soldiers have come to pay their respects to this Dai hero.

Yuan Long was a soldier in a unit stationed in Yunnan. Ten years ago, during a battle against invading Vietnamese troops, he fought alone for over four hours, killing more than 20 enemy soldiers, and sacrificed his young life for the victory. The Central Military Commission conferred upon him the honorary title of "Lone Hero." Yuan Long has become a source of pride for the Dai people.

　　孤胆英雄岩龙雕像落成
    新华社昆明电　（通讯员李通斌、记者段建勋）“孤胆英雄”岩龙烈士的雕像近日在他的家乡云南省西双版纳傣族自治州景洪县的烈士陵园落成。连日来，4000多名群众和边防战士前来瞻仰这位傣族战斗英雄的风采。
    岩龙生前是驻滇某部战士。10年前在一次反击入侵越军的战斗中，他孤军奋战4个多小时，歼敌20余名，为夺取战斗胜利献出了年轻的生命。中央军委授予他“孤胆英雄”的荣誉称号。岩龙成了傣族人民的骄傲。
