Title: "Disdain for Learning" Also Shakes Up Old Teaching Materials and Methods

When it comes to high school and middle school students not studying hard, my wife, who teaches high school, advised me not to waste my energy. She said, "Let the trend of disdain for learning and teaching die out on its own." From her perspective, she shouldn't be so dismissive about this issue. I tried to find some words to refute her, but I lacked the conviction.

The trend of "disdain for learning and teaching" is actually not uncommon. Looking back, we know that Edison skipped school, and Hu Shi, Lu Xun, and Mao Zedong criticized the eight-legged essay. Recently, outdated teaching materials and methods, poor conditions, and low status of intellectual workers have contributed to the resurgence of the "studying is useless" ideology. Using this trend to shake up rigid teaching concepts and outdated educational systems, to discard the old and welcome the new, might not be a bad thing. Of course, not all books are useless. The rational and scientific parts, after being tested or challenged by the "disdain for learning" trend, might become even more precise and popular. Those parts that are indeed useless or have little use will naturally be eliminated. Society advances through the cycles of birth and death, rise and fall, and education and its ideology are no exception. On the other hand, those who have not been blinded by this trend are still the majority. I believe that in this civilized ancient country, with the addition of the inspiring reform and modernization blueprint, we will not be foolish enough to let the "disdain for learning" trend blow unchecked. From the central government to the local levels, information about rectifying education is frequently transmitted. Although seeing significant results will take time, clear-sighted citizens know that merely worrying, looking around, or cursing will not ultimately solve the problem. Instead, through personal action and working with the state, we will eventually drive away the "studying is useless" demon.

　　“厌学”也冲击旧的教材教法
    中国化学工程总公司第七建设公司  刘志俭
    谈到大、中学生不好好读书，现在高中任教的爱人劝我不要去瞎费心思。用她的话来说，“厌学厌教这股风，就让它自生自灭吧。”按理，从她那角度，对此事是不该如此轻描淡写的。我本想找点词驳她，却中气不足。
    “厌学厌教”，其实并不稀奇。从过去看，爱迪生逃学，胡适、鲁迅、毛泽东讨伐八股，人所共知。从近来看，教材教法陈旧，条件简陋，校内外脑力劳动者待遇低下，“读书无用”思潮不“自生”或再生，才是怪事。用它冲击一下僵化的教学观念和落后的教育体制，去旧迎新，未尝不是好事。当然，并非所有的书都读来无用。其中，合理、科学的部分，经受一下“厌学”风的考验或挑战，说不定还会更加精当，受人欢迎；而那些确实无用或用处不大的部分，则自然会被淘汰。社会总是在生与灭、兴与衰的交替中前进，其中的教育及其思想自然也不会例外。另一方面，未被这股风吹昏头脑的，仍是大多数人。相信这么个文明古国，既然如今增添了振奋人心的改革大业和四化蓝图，就不至于愚蠢到任“厌学”风久刮下去的。从中央到地方，整治教育的信息频频传来，尽管见大效还有一个过程，但明眼的国人，恐怕也知道光焦虑、顾盼或怒骂并不能最终解决问题，而是通过身体力行，和国家一道，最终送走“读书无用”这个瘟神。
