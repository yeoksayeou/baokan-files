	From Academia to the Market

	The bustling streets of Beijing's Zhongguancun are lined with science and technology enterprises, each one a star in its own right. By the end of 1988, more than a thousand companies had set up shop on this bustling F-shaped street.

	Haihua Company is one of the prominent firms in Zhongguancun, though its prominence is not due to its assets, scale, or sales volume. Instead, it stands out because it is the only privately-run tech enterprise in Zhongguancun, and indeed the largest in the country, to have emerged from a prestigious university. Its presence on the street, alongside peers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is a testament to its confidence and vitality. However, it also feels isolated and small, as the transition from teacher to entrepreneur seems more challenging than from a tech specialist to a businessperson.

	Haihua's journey began in 1984, slightly later than Fourtune. Haihua's general manager, Ni Zhenwei, and Fourtune's founder, Wan Runnan, started their ventures around the same time. Ni, a deputy professor at Tsinghua University's Thermal Engineering Department, had been teaching at the university since the age of 22. He had published over 40 papers and won numerous scientific and technological awards. Within the competitive environment of Tsinghua, he was a well-known figure. Wan, a graduate of Tsinghua in the 1970s, was technically Ni's junior. While Wan seemed to navigate the business world with ease, Ni found the path more arduous.

	In its first three years, Haihua's economic performance was lackluster, not due to a lack of technology or talent, but because it lacked a commercial mindset and market orientation. Once they broke free from outdated notions and directed all their activities towards the market, the results began to show. In 1988, Haihua's revenue reached 27 million yuan, with profits of 19 million yuan, marking a 389% and 301% increase from 1987. They had traversed a winding road and emerged as one of the most promising and potent companies on Zhongguancun Street.

	Outdated Notion 1: "Old Nine" Disdains Money

	In the spring of 1987, a reporter visited Fourtune, where the annual sales had already exceeded 100 million yuan. The Fourtune team enthusiastically introduced their annual flagship products, discussing commodities, markets, and competition.

	Meanwhile, what was Haihua doing?

	The reporter wandered around Tsinghua University, finally locating the renowned Haihua Company in the basement of a residential building. Here, a group of teachers and students were engaged in a heated discussion: "Should we set up a retail store on Zhongguancun Street?" For a problem that colleagues from the Chinese Academy of Sciences had been tackling for three years and had already made progress on, Haihua was still debating.

	"Setting up a store on Zhongguancun Street? I won't do it. If you insist on setting it up, I'll withdraw from Haihua and have nothing to do with you anymore," a teacher vehemently opposed the idea of a retail store.

	"We're here to develop technology, not to engage in commerce!" Indeed, "Old Nine" never concerned themselves with money. They were undoubtedly a group of outstanding talents, but it was also undeniable that their mindset, ideas, and spirit were still shackled by outdated traditional notions. They despised the smell of money and looked down on commerce, which hindered their progress.

	Haihua was initially established as the "Haihua New Technology Development Center," with the goal of technological development. However, the ultimate purpose of development was to turn the results into commodities and gain market recognition, thereby generating benefits. To understand and expand the market, a retail store on Zhongguancun was essential.

	In 1985, Wan Runnan repeatedly invited Ni Zhenwei to set up a Haihua store next to Fourtune, where the rent was quite affordable. Ni was tempted and wanted to join Wan in creating something. However, he encountered resistance on this very issue. His colleagues strongly opposed it, and Ni himself couldn't make up his mind because he wasn't sure if "setting up a store was the right direction." Later, as people's ideas changed and the company's business required it, the store had to be set up. In the latter half of 1987, Haihua finally opened its first store on Zhongguancun, though no one opposed it anymore. However, the two-year delay cost Haihua hundreds of millions of yuan. Later, Ni reflected, "Isn't this a loss caused by outdated notions?"

	Outdated Notion 2: The Comfort of a "Mother's" Embrace

	Fourtune Company cut off its ties with the Chinese Academy of Sciences from the start, consciously breaking away from the iron rice bowl and embracing the clay rice bowl. They lost stability and security but gained the most crucial resource: the enterprise's autonomy.

	Haihua, however, remained in the embrace of Tsinghua, enjoying its "motherly" love. Wan's actions also stirred Ni, who was constantly grappling with his thoughts. But it was too difficult. Since the age of 18, he had stepped into the Tsinghua campus. Tsinghua nurtured him, and he studied, worked, married, started a family, and lived there for 34 years. If he were to leave Tsinghua, it would mean no more promotions, no more housing. Job titles and housing were the lifeblood of Chinese intellectuals. Ni's thoughts represented those of a group of people at Haihua, and for years, Haihua was often torn between conflicting ideas.

	In 1987, the situation on Zhongguancun Street was increasingly favorable, and public opinion was becoming more unified.

	At this point, Haihua no longer wanted to stay in the basement. It wanted to come out into the open, to test its strength on Zhongguancun Street. In July 1987, it formally severed ties with Tsinghua University, appearing on the market as tech entrepreneurs. In 1987, its income was 66.94 million yuan, with profits reaching 6.3 million yuan. In 1986, it had been in the red for the entire year.

	Ni said, "In the historical transition from a planned economy to a commodity economy, allowing a group of intellectuals to achieve life and psychological weaning under market competition pressure, breaking the survival inertia of holding an iron rice bowl, turning scientific and technological achievements into real material forces, and realizing their value through social recognition, Haihua took the right path but started a bit late. If we had done this two years earlier, Haihua would have thrived even more."

	After the Change in Notion: From Technology-Oriented to Market-Oriented

	In its first three years, Haihua achieved over 40 results, won numerous awards, and had relatively high standards. However, the economic benefits were not significant. Strictly speaking, it still had not produced a single product that could be mass-produced. Many teachers from prestigious universities were experts in their fields, focusing on technology rather than the market. Their technology could be described as perfect and advanced, but turning advanced technology into a commodity was much more challenging than inventing it. Because teachers were too unfamiliar with the intangible market.

	The high-resolution color graphics control board, after the appraisal meeting in May 1987, was initially thought to be quickly turned into a product and exported to the United States, with each board selling for $3,000. However, it was not until this year that it could be turned into a commodity, and the price had dropped from $3,000 to $1,400 per board. Time is money, and Haihua's colleagues understood this deeply.

	When Haihua launched these two boards, some Tsinghua teachers said, "Haihua is going to make a fortune this time!" Ni heard this and could only smile bitterly. If it had been two years earlier, he would have said the same thing, believing that a technology appraisal meeting would lead to market recognition. Years of setbacks had made him abandon his original notions. He said, "In engineering universities, specialties are divided very finely, and teachers focus on the advanced nature of technology within their professional domains. However, commodities require overall, comprehensive performance. Your technology may be comprehensive, but it is only comprehensive in terms of software or hardware. Additionally, there are issues of software-hardware integration. Even if your software-hardware integration performance is optimal, as a commodity, it still requires reliability, practicality, durability, compatibility, aesthetics, packaging, price... If you meet all these conditions, you still need to secure investment, organize production, and so on. Everyone understands that technology needs development. The market also needs development, requiring more effort and more funds, but few teachers understand this. Tsinghua imparted knowledge to me and taught me technology, but Tsinghua did not endow me with the knowledge of commodity production or the market. If I were to return to teaching now, in addition to teaching professional courses, I would definitely teach students about the importance of the commodity economy."

	After shifting from a technology-oriented to a market-oriented approach, Haihua directly faced the international market for product development, producing export-oriented, foreign exchange-earning products. Haihua found the market and established a flexible mechanism, and the benefits followed. Meanwhile, Ni and his partners were also undergoing a transformation, establishing their positions in modern commodity relations. They were no longer just professors but also engineers, managers, salespeople, and entrepreneurs.

	Haihua has changed, Ni has changed, and the managers on Zhongguancun Street are delighted to see Haihua catching up from behind. They truly have not had it easy!

　　从学府走向市场
    清华大学的一批教师走出学苑，在中关村大街上创办科技企业海华公司，他们曾经历了困惑、挫折，最终在现代商品经济活动中寻找到自己的位置。
    本报记者  蒋涵箴
    北京中关村科技企业林立，群星灿烂。这条Ｆ型大街上，到１９８８年底已经开办了上千家公司。
    海华公司也数得上是中关村几大公司之一，然而说它大，并非因为资产大、规模大、销售额大，更主要的是它太有代表性了，它是中关村大街上唯一的一家、也是全国最大的一家从高等学府脱颖而出的民办科技企业。它跻身于这条大街，与出自中国科学院大门的同行们在一起，显得充满信心、充满活力，然而它也觉得自己太孤单，太渺小了，从教师到企业家这个转型似乎比从科技人员到企业家更为艰难。
    它的起步并不晚，１９８４年稍迟于四通成立。海华总经理倪振伟与四通的万润南几乎是同时起家。倪振伟是清华大学热能工程系的副教授，他２２岁就登上清华的讲台，发表过４０余篇论文，得过多项科技成果奖。在人才“挤挤”的清华园内也是知名度颇高的人物。万润南是清华７０年代毕业生，论资排辈，倪振伟应该是万润南的老师。要论办公司，万润南是那么得心应手，倪振伟却是步履艰难。
    海华在开办的头三年经济效益并不高，并非是缺技术、缺人才，而是缺少商品经济观念，缺乏市场导向观念，一旦他们冲破旧观念的束缚，把一切活动都导向市场，效益就出来了。１９８８年它的营业额是２７００万元，利润达到了１９０万元，为１９８７年的３８９％和３０１％。他们走过了一条曲折的道路，一跃成为中关村大街上最有希望、最有潜力的公司之一。
    观念落后之一：“老九”不问孔方兄
    １９８７年春天，记者来到四通，当时他们的年销售额已超过１亿，四通人神采飞扬地向你介绍公司一年一个拳头产品，满口说的是商品、市场、竞争。
    此时此刻海华又是如何呢？
    记者在清华大学转了几大圈，好不容易在一个居民楼的地下室里找到了大名鼎鼎的海华公司。这里聚集着一批教师和大学生，此刻他们正在讨论一个至关重要的问题：“要不要到中关村大街上去设立一个门市部。”对于这么一个科学院的同仁们已经干了三年，而且已经干出了成绩的问题，他们尚在争论不休。
    “要到中关村去设门市部，我不干，你们真的要去设，那我退出海华，以后再也不和你们发生任何关系。”一位老师对门市部如此反感。
    “我们是搞科技开发的，从商我不干！”是啊！“老九”从不过问孔方兄。他们无疑都是经过层层筛选的优秀人才，可也不得不承认他们的心态、观念、精神还被牢牢地锁在落后的传统意识之中。鄙视铜臭，轻视商业的观念捆住了他们的手脚。
    海华公司创办之初为“海华新技术开发中心”，它的宗旨是搞技术开发。可是开发成果的最终目的是为了变成商品，求得市场的承认，唯有如此才能产生效益，要了解市场和开拓市场，必须要在中关村开设门市部。
    １９８５年万润南多次邀请倪振伟在四通公司的旁边开设一个海华门市部，当时房租很便宜，倪振伟心动了，也想和四通一起干一番事业。可是恰恰在这个问题上他碰了钉子，同仁们激烈反对，连倪振伟自己也下不了决心，因为他不清楚“设门市部大方向对不对”。后来随着人们观念的变化，公司业务的需要，门市部非开不可了，１９８７年下半年海华才在中关村开设了第一个门市部，尽管此时已经没有人反对了，可两年的时间差使海华白白损失了好几百万元，事后倪振伟说：“这难道不是观念落后带来的损失吗？”
    观念落后之二：“慈母”的怀抱多温暖
    四通公司从一开始就给自己切断了后路，与中国科学院脱钩，他们自觉地打破了铁饭碗，端上了泥饭碗，它失去了稳定感、安全感，但得到了一个最重要的资源，这就是企业的自主决策权。
    海华一直躺在清华这个“慈母”的怀抱里，享受着她的“母爱”。万润南的行动也震动了倪振伟，他一直在进行思想斗争。可是太难了，他从１８岁起迈进了清华园，清华哺育他成长，他在清华学习、工作、结婚、成家、生儿育女，生活了３４年。如果要脱离清华，意味着今后升职称无望，分房子无望。职称、住房，这可是中国知识分子的命根子。倪振伟的想法代表了海华一批人的思想，为此，几年来海华常常处在矛盾之中。
    １９８７年，中关村一条街的形势已经越来越好，社会舆论也日渐趋向一致。
    这时，海华再也不愿意憋在地下室里了，它要走到地面上来，它要到中关村大街上去试试自己的实力。１９８７年７月，它正式与清华大学脱离关系，以科技企业家的面貌出现在市场上，１９８７年收入６６９．４万元，利润达６３万元。而１９８６年它是全年亏损。
    倪振伟说：“在由计划经济向商品经济转轨的历史变革中，让一部分知识分子在市场竞争的压力下实现生活和心理的断乳，打破捧铁饭碗的生存惰性，把科技成果转化为现实的物质力量，使自身的价值得到社会承认，海华这条路走对了，但走得晚了点，如果我们早两年这样干了，海华就会兴旺得多。”
    观念转变之后：从技术导向到市场导向
    海华成立的头三年取得了４０多项成果，获奖不少，水平也较高，但经济效益不大，严格说来，至今还没有一个产品能形成规模生产。名牌大学的教师不少人专业拔尖，他们着眼于技术而不求市场。论技术可以说是完美的、先进的，但先进的技术要成为商品比发明这项技术难得多。因为教师对这一看不见、摸不着的市场太陌生了。
    高分辨率彩色图形控制板，１９８７年５月开完鉴定会，当时以为很快就能搞出产品，出口到美国，每块能卖３０００美元，可是到今年才能形成商品，而价格已从每片３０００美元跌到１４００美元。时间就是金钱，对此海华的同志体会最深。
    当海华推出这两块板时，清华有些老师说：“海华这下可要发大财了！”倪振伟听了只是苦笑，如果在两年之前，他也会如此说的，以为某一项技术开完鉴定会就能被市场承认。几年的挫折使他否定了原先的想法。他说：“理工科大学专业分得很细，教师们注重本专业领域里技术的先进性，而商品是要求有整体的、全面的性能。你的技术是全面的，也只是软件或硬件的全面，此外还有软硬件结合的问题，即使你软硬件结合的性能是最佳的，作为商品还要求可靠性、实用性、耐久性、兼容性、美观、包装、价格……假如你这一切条件都具备了，你还得争取到投资，组织生产等等。技术需要开发，这大家都懂。市场也需要开发，需要花更大的力气，更多的资金，但懂得这一点的教师太少了。清华给我传授了知识，教会了我技术，可是清华没有赋于我商品生产的知识、市场的知识。如果现在再让我回去教书，我除了讲专业课外，一定要对学生讲商品经济的重要性。”
    海华从技术导向转到市场导向后，直接面对国际市场进行产品开发，生产出口创汇产品。海华找到了市场，具备了一个灵活的机制，效益就产生了。与此同时倪振伟和他的伙伴们也正在实现自身的转型，在现代商品关系中确立了自己的地位，他们已不仅仅是教授，而且也是工程师、管理家、推销员、企业家。
    海华变了，倪振伟变了，中关村大街上的经理们欣喜地看着海华从后面赶上来，他们真不容易啊！
