The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) recently held its annual meeting in San Francisco, where a revised "Athlete Scholarship Regulation" was narrowly approved. This new regulation imposes stricter requirements on athletes with poor academic performance.

According to the new rules, outstanding high school football or basketball players seeking scholarships must have an average grade of "C" or higher in their core subjects. Additionally, they must score at least 700 out of 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). Those who do not meet these criteria will not only be ineligible for scholarships but will also be suspended from play for a year to focus on their studies.

Many university athletic departments strongly oppose this new regulation, with the most vocal being John Thompson, the basketball coach at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., and the head coach of the U.S. men's basketball team at the Seoul Olympics. Thompson, who is African American, argues that the new regulation discriminates against students from disadvantaged backgrounds, depriving many young athletes of the chance to showcase their talents. If these "prospective athletes" are forced to take a year off to improve their SAT scores, approximately 600 of them will be affected each year, with 90% of them being African American.

The NCAA's decision to revise the regulations comes amid intense competition among schools to recruit high school stars, with many students becoming professional athletes even before graduating from high school.

　　美国学生体育尖子面临抉择：读书？还是打球
    美国大学生体育联合会日前在旧金山举行的年会上，以微弱多数通过了修改的“运动员奖学金规定”。这对许多成绩欠佳的运动员要求更为苛刻。
    根据新的规定，美国橄榄球或篮球队中优秀的高中选手在进入大学并申请奖学金时，其高中的主要课目成绩应平均在“Ｃ”以上，在满分为１６００分的“学力测试”（统一高考）中，至少应取得７００分。如不符合这些条件，非但不能申请奖学金，还要停赛一年来补课。
    许多大学的体育部门对此新规定坚决反对，其中最有代表性的是华盛顿的乔治敦大学篮球队教练约翰·汤普森。这位黑人教练也是汉城奥运会美国男篮的教头。他认为新规定对学习条件较差的穷人家孩子是一种歧视，剥夺了许多青少年运动员施展才能的机会。如果为了提高高考成绩而停赛一年，这些“候补运动员”每年将多达６００人，其中９０％是黑人。美国大学生体联之所以要修改规定，是因为如今各队互挖高中明星的争夺愈演愈烈，许多高中生在毕业前便成为职业运动员。
