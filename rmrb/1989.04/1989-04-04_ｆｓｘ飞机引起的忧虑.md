		Concerns Raised by the FSX Aircraft

		Recently, officials from the political, financial, and military sectors in the United States have engaged in an unusual debate regarding the joint development of the FSX new-generation fighter aircraft by the U.S. and Japan.

		According to the agreement reached by both the U.S. and Japan, Japan will utilize American technology to develop the FSX fighter aircraft. However, the FSX aircraft is a new version of the F-16 fighter, involving many of America's top-secret advanced technologies. Therefore, many key figures in the American financial sector and Congress are firmly opposed to this agreement. They believe that if the agreement is implemented, it will undoubtedly pose a threat to America's future advanced technologies, particularly in the field of aviation. Currently, the U.S. still leads the world in aviation technology. However, the "Airbus" produced in Europe has already posed a significant threat and caused substantial losses to the U.S. aviation industry. If Japan obtains the technology for manufacturing the F-16 fighter aircraft, it is highly likely that Japan will use this technology to develop new civilian aircraft, thereby making the U.S. face another strong competitor in the international aviation market. It seems that America's concerns are not without reason.

		In recent years, trade frictions between the U.S. and Japan have been frequent, from the "car war," "computer war," "semiconductor war," to the "beef war," and so on, indicating that economic relations between the two countries are becoming increasingly tense. In addition, the Japanese have taken advantage of the appreciation of the yen to purchase large amounts of land, establish factories, and buy companies in the U.S., making Americans increasingly uneasy. In February of this year, the Washington Post and the American Broadcasting Company conducted a nationwide sample opinion poll, and the results showed that 44% of the respondents believed that Japan's strong economic power poses a greater threat to U.S. security than Soviet missiles. As Japan's competitiveness continues to strengthen, Americans' concerns will only increase.

　　ＦＳＸ飞机引起的忧虑
    美国政、财、军界人士最近就美日联合研制ＦＳＸ新型战斗机一事展开了异乎寻常的争论。
    根据美日双方达成的协议，日本将利用美国的技术研制ＦＳＸ战斗机。可是，ＦＳＸ战斗机是一种新型Ｆ—１６战斗机，涉及美国许多机密尖端技术。因此，美国财界和国会中的不少要员坚决要求取消这项协议。他们认为，协议一旦实施，无疑会对美国未来尖端技术，特别是航空技术带来威胁。目前，美国在世界航空技术方面仍居领先地位。但是，欧洲生产的“空中客车”已给美国航空工业造成了巨大威胁和不小损失，如果日本获得美国制造Ｆ—１６战斗机的技术，很有可能利用这种技术研制新型民用飞机，从而使美国在国际航空市场上又面临一位强劲的竞争对手。看来，美国的担心不无道理。
    近年来，美日之间的贸易摩擦频仍，从“汽车战”、“电脑战”、“半导体战”到“牛肉战”等等，表明美日经济关系日趋紧张。除此之外，日本人利用日元升值之机，在美国大举购地皮、开工厂、买公司，使美国人日益不安。今年２月，美国《华盛顿邮报》和美国广播公司进行了一次全国范围抽样民意测验，结果发现其中４４％的人认为，对于美国安全来说，日本强大的经济实力比之苏联的导弹更具危险性。随着日本竞争力不断加强，美国人的忧虑会有增无已。
