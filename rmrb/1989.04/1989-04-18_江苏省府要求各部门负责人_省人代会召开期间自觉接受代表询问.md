Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, April 18th — The Jiangsu Provincial Committee and Provincial Government recently required that the heads of various government departments should not leave during the Provincial People's Congress, should not schedule other meetings, and should be prepared to answer questions from representatives directly in the representative groups.

It is understood that in the past, during the Provincial People's Congress, some government department heads often found excuses not to attend and answer questions from the People's Congress representatives, which caused dissatisfaction among the representatives. A responsible person from the preparatory committee for the Second Session of the Seventh Jiangsu Provincial People's Congress told reporters that in the past few days, several bureaus and departments have called to express that they have made preparations.

　　江苏省府要求各部门负责人
　　省人代会召开期间自觉接受代表询问
    新华社南京４月１８日电　（记者张伟弟、殷学成）江苏省委、省政府日前要求政府各部门主要负责人在召开省人代会期间，不要外出，不要另外安排会议，要服从人代会的需要，到各代表团直接回答代表提出的询问。
    据悉，过去在省人大会议期间，有的政府部门负责人常借故不到会回答人大代表提出的询问，对此，人大代表很不满意。将于４月２０日召开的江苏省七届人大二次会议筹备处负责人告诉记者，这两天已有几个厅局来电话表示已做好准备。
