Leading by Example and Facilitating Supervision

Hebei Publishes Integrity Guidelines to Regulate Provincial-Level Leaders' Behavior

Our reporter Chen Guoqing reports from Shijiazhuang: Yesterday, Hebei publicly released the integrity guidelines for provincial-level party and government officials to regulate and standardize the behavior and work style of leading officials, thereby accepting supervision from a broader range of party members and the masses.

The integrity guidelines cover political, organizational, ideological, living, and overseas aspects, among others. The main contents are as follows: Provincial-level officials must not violate regulations by issuing unauthorized directives or making unauthorized decisions, and must not plead or cover up for lawbreakers or violators, including relatives and friends. They must not use public funds or public property for gifts, and must not accept gifts from subordinates. They must not engage in any form of business or gain personal benefits. When visiting the countryside, they must adhere to simple and unassuming travel, avoid elaborate receptions, and have "four dishes and one soup" for meals. They must not accept invitations to dine and must pay according to regulations. When traveling within the province or abroad for visits and inspections, they must not violate regulations to purchase items or use public funds for tourism. Housing and various benefits must be implemented according to regulations, and special treatment must not be sought. When resting outside the province, if family members and children accompany, the expenses must be borne by themselves. For issues related to the education, employment, party membership, promotion, housing, and overseas travel of family members, children, relatives, and staff, they must not intervene or interfere. They must voluntarily abide by organizational and personnel discipline, and use cadres strictly according to the party's standards.
