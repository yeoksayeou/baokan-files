How to ensure that party building in minority nationalities regions, along with the rest of the country, follows a new path of reform and institutional construction—combining national characteristics to strengthen party work

Vice Secretary of the Communist Party of China, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee, Āmùdōng·Níyǎzī

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, our party has shouldered the historical responsibility of leading the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics. At the same time, it faces the dual tests of governance and reform and opening up. This new leadership responsibility and historical test urgently require us to strengthen party building and strive to enhance the combat effectiveness of party organizations.

For us in minority nationalities regions, how to shoulder this glorious historical mission from the actual situation of our locality, and to accept the dual tests, so that our party building in minority nationalities regions, along with the rest of the country, follows a new path of reform and institutional construction without resorting to political campaigns, requires us to pay high attention to and study and explore. Based on my understanding and experience, several issues need to be addressed at present.

Firstly, we must fully recognize the commonality and specificity of party work in minority nationalities regions, and proceed from the actual situation of minority nationalities regions. The fundamental principle of party's ideological and theoretical construction is to combine theory with practice, seek truth from facts, and proceed from reality. Only by rooting the party's ideological and theoretical construction in minority nationalities regions in the reality of minority nationalities regions, can we achieve the desired effect. Otherwise, it will become empty preaching detached from reality, and it will be difficult to achieve the expected goals. The reality of Xinjiang is that the development of various undertakings such as economy and culture still lags far behind the developed regions in the interior. Its characteristics are: (1) Located in a remote area, transportation is inconvenient, and information is blocked; (2) The economic foundation is weak, the level of productive forces is low, and the commodity economy is not developed; (3) Culture, education, and science and technology are relatively backward compared to the advanced provinces and regions in the interior; the cultural quality is relatively low, farmers and herdsmen are constrained by traditional concepts, lack commodity economy concepts, and have weak reform consciousness; (4) There are many ethnic groups, with 13 major ethnic groups, and minority nationalities account for 60% of the total population of the region. Except for a few who believe in Buddhism, Lamaism, and Christianity, the vast majority of minority nationalities believe in Islam. In terms of cultural traditions, customs, religious beliefs, languages, and scripts, there are significant differences from the provinces, municipalities, and districts in the interior. Faced with such objective realities, we must implement the line of the Thirteenth National Congress of the Party, lead the broad masses of party members and people of all ethnic groups to carry out reform and opening up, and engage in the great cause of modernization, to achieve common progress and prosperity of all ethnic groups, and to consolidate and develop a stable and united political situation. The tasks are more arduous, more onerous, and the difficulties are also greater. Party's ideological and theoretical construction must proceed from this reality. It is not feasible to seek quick results, nor is it feasible to take slow steps.

Secondly, we must conduct education on the party's national policies for party organizations and the broad masses of party members in minority nationalities regions, and further enhance the great unity of all ethnic groups.

The national question is a long-standing historical phenomenon. Throughout the entire socialist historical stage, especially the primary stage of socialism, we must attach great importance to the national question. First, in carrying out various work in minority nationalities regions, we must reflect the national characteristics and correctly reflect the national psychological quality. Only in this way can we win the hearts of the people, conform to the wishes of the people, and gain the sincere support and support of the people of all ethnic groups, and enhance the cohesion of the party among the minority nationalities. Second, we must persistently and extensively carry out the education of Marxist national view, the party's national policies, and national unity. This is an important part of the party's ideological and theoretical construction in minority nationalities regions in the new period. Whether it is rectification, reform and opening up, or modernization, we need a good social and political environment, and national unity and social stability are necessary conditions for creating such a social and political environment. This is the common wish and fundamental interest of the people of all ethnic groups. It is beneficial to the development of social productive forces in minority nationalities regions, beneficial to the prosperity and prosperity of minority nationalities, and beneficial to the prosperity and strength of the country. This is the starting point of our strengthening the party building in minority nationalities regions, and it is also the standard for us to measure the good or bad of a party organization's work.

In the education of party members on Marxist national view, various levels of party organizations should focus on educating party members of all ethnic groups to distinguish between Marxist national view and bourgeois national view, to firmly establish the idea that "the Han nationality cannot do without the minority nationalities, and the minority nationalities cannot do without the Han nationality," to adhere to opposing and correcting various erroneous tendencies and national prejudices in the national question, and to be a model in executing the party's national policies and maintaining national unity. No matter who damages national unity and splits national unity, we must firmly and resolutely fight against them and never indulge or tolerate them. At the same time, we should take whether to execute national policies and maintain national unity as an important condition for developing party members, selecting cadres, and selecting advanced party branches and outstanding party members.

Thirdly, correctly handle the religious beliefs of party members and help party members to firmly establish a communist worldview.

Correctly handling the religious beliefs of party members is an important part of strengthening party building in minority nationalities regions in the new period. Due to social and historical reasons, the vast majority of minority nationalities in our region believe in religion.

Minority nationality party members account for 38.4% of the total number of party members, and a considerable part of them believe in religion. Such problems cannot be dealt with simply and rashly, and must be guided correctly. If not handled properly, it will be a great factor of instability.

The party organizations at various levels in our region have, on the basis of educating party members on the basic knowledge of the party and the standards of party members, concentrated on educating party members on Marxist religious views. They have taken atheist education and the party's religious policies as important contents of party lessons and party member training, explaining the reasons why Marxists are materialists and atheists, and party members should not believe in religion and are not allowed to participate in religious activities. In addition, they have made the broad masses of party members truly understand the essence and social function of religion in their minds; distinguish between citizens' freedom of belief and party members' ideals and beliefs, and consciously adhere to materialism and oppose idealism at all times and in all places; break away from superstition, get rid of spiritual shackles, innovate, and strive to do a good job in the construction of socialist spiritual civilization in minority nationalities regions. Strengthening the ideological and theoretical construction of the party in minority nationalities regions is a long-term and arduous task, but it is also a great cause. As long as we proceed from the actual situation of the locality and reflect the national characteristics, we will definitely be able to do this work well and achieve remarkable results.

　　如何使少数民族地区党的建设同全国一道，走出一条靠改革和制度建设的新路子——    
    结合民族特点做好党的工作
    中共新疆维吾尔自治区委副书记  阿木冬·尼牙孜
    党的十一届三中全会以来，我们党肩负着领导建设有中国特色的社会主义的历史重任，同时也面临着执政和改革开放的双重考验，这种新的领导责任和新的历史考验都迫切要求我们加强党的建设，努力提高党组织的战斗力。
    这对我们少数民族地区党的组织和党员干部来说，如何从本地的实际情况出发，很好地去承担这一光荣的历史重任，接受双重考验，从而使我们少数民族地区党的建设同全国一道，走出一条不搞政治运动，而靠改革和制度建设的新路子，需要我们高度重视和研究探讨。根据我的认识和体会，目前需要解决好几个问题。
    首先，要充分认识少数民族地区党的工作的共同性和特殊性，要从少数民族地区的实际出发。党的思想理论建设的根本方针，是理论联系实际，实事求是，一切从实际出发。只有把党在少数民族地区的思想理论建设，扎根于少数民族地区的现实之中，才能做到有的放矢，收到好的效果。否则，就会走向脱离实际的空洞说教，难以达到预期的目的。新疆的现实就是经济文化等各项事业的发展比起内地发达地区还有很大的差距。其特点是：（一）地处偏远，交通不便，信息闭塞；（二）经济基础薄弱，生产力水平低，商品经济不发达；（三）文化、教育、科学技术比起内地先进省区还比较落后；文化素质比较低，农牧民受传统观念的束缚，缺乏商品经济观念，改革意识薄弱；（四）民族成份较多，主要民族就有１３个，少数民族人口占全区总人口的６０％，除少数人信仰佛教、喇嘛教、基督教外，绝大多数少数民族信奉伊斯兰教。在文化传统、风俗习惯、宗教信仰、语言文字等方面，同内地省、市、区有很大不同。面对这样的客观实际，我们要贯彻党的十三大路线，带领广大党员和各族人民群众进行改革开放，投身四化建设的伟大事业，实现各民族的共同进步和繁荣，巩固和发展安定团结的政治局面，任务更艰巨，更繁重，难度也更大。党的思想理论建设，必须从这个现实情况出发，急于求成不行，步子慢了也不行。
    其次，要对少数民族地区的党组织和广大党员普遍进行党的民族政策的教育，进一步增强各民族的大团结。
    民族问题是一个长期存在的历史现象，整个社会主义历史阶段，尤其是社会主义初级阶段，必须高度重视民族问题。一是在少数民族地区开展各项工作，都要体现民族特点，正确地反映民族心理素质。只有这样，才能顺乎民心，符合民意，得到各族人民的衷心拥护和支持，增强各少数民族对党的凝聚力。二是要坚持不懈地、广泛深入地开展马克思主义民族观、党的民族政策和民族团结的教育，这是新时期少数民族地区党的思想理论建设的重要内容之一。无论是治理整顿，还是改革开放和四化建设，都需要一个良好的社会环境和政治环境，而民族团结、社会安定正是创造这样一种社会环境和政治环境的必要条件。这是各族人民的共同愿望和根本利益之所在。有利于少数民族地区社会生产力的发展，有利于少数民族的繁荣昌盛和国家富强，是我们加强少数民族地区党的建设的出发点，也是我们衡量一个党组织工作的好坏的标准。
    在对党员进行马克思主义民族观的教育中，各级党组织应着重教育各族党员划清马克思主义民族观与资产阶级民族观的界限，牢固树立“汉族离不开少数民族，少数民族离不开汉族”的思想，坚持反对和纠正在民族问题上的各种错误倾向和民族偏见，做执行党的民族政策，维护民族团结的模范。无论是谁破坏民族团结，分裂祖国统一，我们都要旗帜鲜明的与之进行坚决的斗争，决不姑息迁就。同时，把是否执行民族政策，维护民族团结作为发展党员、选拔干部、评选先进党支部和优秀党员的重要条件。
    第三，正确处理党员的宗教信仰问题，帮助党员牢固树立共产主义世界观。
    正确处理党员的宗教信仰问题，是新时期加强少数民族地区党的建设的一个重要内容。由于社会和历史的原因，我区的少数民族，绝大多数信仰宗教。
    少数民族党员占党员总数的３８．４％，其中有相当一部分人信仰宗教，这样的问题，绝不能简单从事，草率处理，必须循循善诱，正确疏导。如处理不好，就是一个很大的不安定因素。
    我区各级党组织在对党员进行党的基本知识和党员标准教育的基础上，比较集中地对党员进行了马克思主义宗教观教育。他们把无神论教育和党的宗教政策教育作为党课和党员培训的重要内容，讲清马克思主义者是唯物论者、无神论者、共产党员不应该信仰宗教，不允许参加宗教活动的道理。另外还使广大党员从思想上真正明确宗教的本质和社会作用；分清公民的信教自由和党员的理想信念的界限，自觉地做到时时处处坚持唯物主义，反对唯心主义；破除迷信，丢掉精神枷锁，开拓创新，努力搞好少数民族地区的社会主义精神文明建设。加强少数民族地区党的思想理论建设是一个长期而艰巨的任务，又是一项伟大的事业。只要我们从当地实际情况出发，体现民族特点，就一定能够把这项工作做好，并取得显著成效。
