The silkworm cocoon procurement season is approaching, and leaders from 15 counties in Henan Province, a major silkworm cocoon production area, gathered in Zhengzhou to discuss strategies to prevent a "big battle" over silkworm cocoons this year. When talking about the growth of silkworms, all attendees showed satisfaction, but when it came to procurement, they all looked worried.

Henan is an important silkworm cocoon base in China. Last year's "big battle" over silkworm cocoons caused a loss of over 5 million yuan to the state. Although measures have been taken early this year, the manager of the Henan branch of the China Silk Import and Export Company, Fan Songkui, told reporters that the hidden dangers that led to the "big battle" have not been eliminated: first, the supply-demand contradiction has not been eased. Especially for mulberry silk, the production is only one-tenth of the demand; second, many of those who profited from last year's "big battle" have not been dealt with. This year, with the market silk price rising, they will likely rush in again; third, currently, the procurement of silkworm cocoons for agricultural use is handled by the agricultural department, while commercial cocoons are handled by foreign trade. Multiple procurement channels can easily lead to price hikes and competition for resources; fourth, some places, for local interests, set their own border prices and purchase silkworm cocoons from neighboring counties, making a "big battle" imminent. Additionally, it is difficult to prevent high-price purchases by coastal merchants.

Rushan County was commended by higher authorities for strictly implementing national policies and curbing the "big battle" last year. However, Deputy County Magistrate Wen Deshun said, "Our efforts to stop the 'big battle' were not popular among the people." Last year, we issued a strict order not to raise prices, but as soon as neighboring counties raised their prices, a large amount of silkworm cocoons flowed out. Not only did we fall far short of the quota, but even the county's reeling factory was about to shut down. In the end, we had to raise the price slightly. This year, we can guarantee that we will not "fire the first shot" in our county.

Nanchong County was the main site of last year's "big battle" and has become the target of criticism this year. The leaders of Nanchong County also have their difficulties: handmade silk carpet processing has spread throughout Nanchong, requiring 300 tons of silk each year, most of which is purchased from neighboring counties. This year, if we ask them to follow the rules and not raise prices or compete for purchases, it will undoubtedly cut off the supply of raw materials for many silk carpets, will the people listen to the county leaders?

The general view of the Henan silkworm cocoon production area officials is that from the central government to local authorities, various notices and documents to prevent the "big battle" over silkworm cocoons are not lacking and are quite specific. The key is how to implement them. The attendees said that if there are policies, there should be people to supervise and enforce them. If there are laws, they should be strictly followed. Only then can a new "big battle" be avoided.

　　“大战”隐患未消除　收购季节又将至
　　河南干部忧心忡忡话蚕桑
    本报记者　李而亮
    蚕茧收购季节将至，河南省蚕茧产地１５个地县的领导干部汇集郑州，为防止今年“蚕茧大战”共商对策。谈到蚕桑长势，与会者无不面露喜色，一说到收购，却又都忧心忡忡。
    河南是我国重要蚕茧基地。去年一场“蚕茧大战”，使国家损失了５００多万元。今年虽然早订措施早安排，但中国丝绸进出口公司河南分公司的经理樊松奎向记者说，引起“大战”的隐患未根除：一是供需矛盾没有缓解。尤其是桑蚕丝，产量仅为需求量的１／１０；二是去年“大战”中渔利者，许多没有处理。今年市场丝价见涨，这些人还会一哄而上；三是目前种茧收购归农业部门，商品茧归外贸。多头收购，很容易抬价抢货源；四是一些地方为了本地利益，自定边境价格，抢购邻县蚕丝，“大战”一触即发。另外，沿海商贩的高价抢购也很难防范。
    鲁山县由于去年执行国家政策坚决，抑制大战下力而受到上级表扬。但副县长文德顺说，我们制止“大战”在群众中却“不得人心”。去年，我们开始下死令不准抬价，但邻县价钱一提，大量蚕茧就流走了。不仅上交任务差得远，连县里的缫丝厂也要断“炊”，最后也被迫往上提提。今年，我们能保证做到的就是，不在我们县“打第一枪”。
    南召县是去年“大战”主要燃发地，今年成了众矢之的。南召县的领导也有难言之苦：手工丝毯加工已在南召遍地开花，每年需要用丝３００吨，绝大部分靠到邻县购买。今年要让他们规规矩矩，不去抬价抢购，无疑会断了许多丝织毯的原材供应，群众能听县领导的吗？
    河南蚕茧产地干部的普遍看法是，从中央到地方，为防止蚕茧大战，各种通知、文件不谓不多，不谓不具体，关键的是怎样落到实处。与会者说，有政策就该有人去监督执行，有法令就该动真格的。这样新的“大战”才能避免。
