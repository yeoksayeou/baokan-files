Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 28th.

The Supreme Court of the Soviet Union has decided to reverse the convictions of 150 wrongful cases from the 1930s and 1940s and the early 1950s.

According to today's report in *Pravda*, the Supreme Court held a full meeting on April 27th to review 169 historical cases, determining that 150 of them were wrongful convictions and should be reversed.

The meeting noted that among those who were exonerated, 101 were victims of alleged "anti-Soviet propaganda" and were suppressed, 17 were accused of plotting "terrorist actions" against "party and state leaders" and were tried, and some cases were purely fabricated with false evidence.

Prior to this, the Soviet Union had already reversed the convictions of famous figures such as Bukharin.

    新华社莫斯科４月２８日电  苏联最高法院作出决定，为３０至４０年代和５０年代初期的１５０个冤假错案平反。
    据《真理报》今天报道，苏联最高法院２７日举行全体会议，审理了１６９个历史案件，认定其中１５０个系冤假错案，予以平反昭雪。
    会议指出，获平反者中有１０１人是由于进行所谓“反苏宣传”而遭镇压的，另有１７人是被指控要对“党和国家领导人”采取“恐怖行动”遭审判的，还有些案件则纯属制造伪证。
    在这之前，苏联已为布哈林等著名活动家平了反。
