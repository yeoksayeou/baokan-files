Gorbachev Delivers Speech in London
Calls for Building a Peaceful Era, Announces Soviet Union to Halt Uranium Production This Year

	People's Daily, London, April 7 (Reported by Chen Te'an): Mikhail Gorbachev, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, delivered a lengthy speech today at London's Guildhall, calling for the establishment of a peaceful era. He announced that the Soviet Union will halt the production of uranium used for manufacturing nuclear weapons this year and emphasized the Soviet Union's obligations in eliminating chemical weapons.

	In discussing arms control, Gorbachev pointed out that relying on military force is dangerous, and it is time to end nuclear deterrence. He said that the Soviet Union and Britain have the potential to contribute to this process. He reminded NATO not to modernize weapons, stating that this would threaten the recently signed Geneva agreements. He stressed that the Soviet Union opposes any plans to modernize nuclear weapons. He said, "We ourselves are not modernizing weapons and do not intend to modernize them unless we are forced to." He also emphasized that the Soviet Union is prepared to participate in a broad and in-depth process of demilitarizing Europe.

	In discussing Soviet reforms, Gorbachev emphasized that the Soviet Union's reforms will not reverse course. He said that the path to comprehensive democratization is the choice of the Soviet people. He expressed his belief that the democratization of the Soviet Union will open the way for some countries to get out of their predicaments in the world economy.

	Gorbachev and his wife left Heathrow Airport at 3:30 PM today, ending their two-day visit to Britain and returning home.
