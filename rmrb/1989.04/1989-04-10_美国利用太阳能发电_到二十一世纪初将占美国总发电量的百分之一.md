	Solar power generation in the United States is expected to account for one percent of the total electricity by the early 21st century. Initially, many experts believed that the efficiency of solar cells could not exceed 30 percent (the efficiency of solar cells in pocket calculators is less than 3 percent). So far, solar cells have been mainly used in spacecraft and other applications where cost is not a concern, as well as in communication networks, navigation equipment, recreational vehicles, and households far from power lines. Now, due to technological advancements, reduced production costs, and other factors, several solar power plants supplying electricity to public utilities are under construction.

	The Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico, has established an experimental device called a "mechanically stacked multi-junction solar cell." This device converts 31 percent of light energy into electrical energy. Scientists at Sandia believe that this device, due to its ability to use series-connected cells, can achieve an efficiency of 35 percent in the next few years, making solar power generation comparable to conventional power generation in terms of efficiency (the average efficiency of coal and oil-fired power plants is 34 percent). With further improvements, this new series-connected cell and other new technologies will achieve an efficiency of 38 percent.

	Dr. Dan E. Arizmendi, the head of the solar cell project at Sandia, believes that recent developments indicate that electricity generated from solar energy will account for one percent of the total electricity in the United States by the early 21st century. Currently, the United States generates about 600 billion watts of electricity, and one percent of this would be 60 billion watts, which can meet the needs of over 300 million people.

	Experts say that in the next 10 to 20 years, solar power plants will make significant contributions to the electricity supply in advanced countries, especially during peak usage periods when conventional power generation capacity is overloaded, causing dimming or even blackouts. Significant advances in solar cells will accelerate the transition away from mineral fuels, helping to combat the greenhouse effect caused by increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

　　美国利用太阳能发电
    到二十一世纪初将占美国总发电量的百分之一
    早先许多专家认为，光电池的效率达不到百分之三十（袖珍计算器上光电池的效率低于百分之三）。迄今为止，太阳能电池主要用于宇宙飞船等不计较费用的用途，以及与电力隔绝的通信网络、导航设备、旅游车船和远离电源线的家庭等。现在由于技术的进步、生产成本的下降和其它因素，一些向公用事业供电的太阳能发电厂正在建设中。
    新墨西哥州阿尔伯克基的桑迪亚国家实验室建立了一个称为“机械堆积式多接点太阳能电池”的实验性装置，它把百分之三十一的光能转化成电能。桑迪亚的科学家们认为，这种装置由于具有应用串联电池的能力，其效率在今后几年内可达百分之三十五，从而使太阳能发电第一次能在效率上和常规发电相比拟（燃煤和燃油电厂的平均效率为百分之三十四）。经进一步完善，这种新型串联电池和其它新技术将使效率达到百分之三十八。
    桑迪亚的光电池计划主持人丹·Ｅ·阿维祖博士认为，最近的进展表明由太阳能转换成的电能在二十一世纪初将占美国总发电量的百分之一。目前，美国发电量约六千亿瓦，百分之一将是六十亿瓦，它能满足三百多万人的需求。
    专家们说，再过十至二十年，太阳能发电厂就能对先进国家的供电作出重大贡献，特别是在常规发电能力的过量负荷导致灯火变暗甚至熄灭的用电高峰期间。太阳能电池的重要进展将会加速摆脱矿物燃料的过渡，从而有助于与大气中二氧化碳增加所引起的温室效应作斗争。
