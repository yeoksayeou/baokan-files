Local officials have varying views on the current agricultural situation and propose methods to break through the stagnation. Recently, during the "Modern Rural Economy Seminar" held at the National Rural Economy Talent Training Center, reporters invited several county and municipal agricultural officials to discuss. They came from China's economic "first," "second," and "third" worlds, and their ideas and methods are worth reading.

Local Officials Discuss Stagnation

Reporters Jiang Xia and Wu Changsheng

Big Concept: Stagnation is mainly in grain and cotton, rural economy is developing

The difficulty in agriculture lies in grain production, and the difficulty in grain production lies in completing the state's contract procurement.

Ding Shiyin, Director of the Agricultural Economy Commission of Jiaxing, a major grain-producing area in Zhejiang, said that from Jiaxing's perspective, the rural economy has not stagnated. The difficulty lies in grain production, and the greatest difficulty is in the state's contract procurement. The national grain contract procurement quantity has been reduced year by year, but Jiaxing not only has not reduced it, but because wheat is not included in the task, the actual procurement quantity of rice has increased. The grain price is low, the procurement task is heavy, and the price of production materials has soared. Farmers are squeezed from both ends, so how can they be happy to grow grain?

Even a season of total crop failure won't cause a grain shortage; exporting grain is a loss, and the people are lying in wait.

Luonan County in Shaanxi Province was once a poor county. In the past, tens of trucks had to be sent to Guanzhong to bring back beggars from outside. Now, grain is not only enough to eat but can also be exported. On average, every year 1,000 households of farmers' homes change from mud and wood structures to brick and wood structures, and the per capita savings increase rate has also increased by two digits. County Magistrate Jia Shimao introduced these situations with great pleasure: "From the speed of farmers' living standards improvement, the rural economic situation is good, and we have not felt tense about grain." When talking about the fact that Luonan's grain production in the past two years has not recovered to the highest production of 139 million kilograms in a year, Jia Shimao calculated: To ensure the grain for the entire county's people, contract procurement grain, feed for 600,000 pigs, and 200,000 chickens, and raw materials for liquor and starch factories, 1.4 billion kilograms of grain is needed. However, the actual situation is that in the past two years, not only has it been running normally, but even if a season does not produce grain, there will be no grain shortage. In 1986, due to disasters, a season was basically a total failure, but it passed smoothly. When asked about the county's view on the people reporting reduced production and lying in wait, County Magistrate Jia frankly said, "In the Shanzhou region's 7 counties, only our county did not enjoy the preferential treatment of poor counties. The region's 300 million kilograms of contract procurement tasks were undertaken by us with 108.75 million kilograms. Now our per capita income is only 276 yuan, and the county's financial income is very small. Exporting grain is a loss, and if we are to be advanced in exporting more grain, who will bear the pain of the people?"

Behind the continuous growth, there is indeed a hidden crisis of stagnation.

Anxi County in the western end of the Hexi Corridor in Gansu Province is an agricultural county with crop cultivation as the main industry. It has superior natural conditions for drought and flood resistance, and grain production has been stable and increasing for nearly 10 years, with an increase of 3.9% last year compared to the previous year. However, Deputy Secretary of the County Committee Lu Quanzhong is not very optimistic: "We cannot just look at the increase in grain production, but also look at how the grain is increased. After 1986, we adopted many non-economic measures commonly used before the household contract responsibility system, one is ideological education, and the other is administrative allocation. Which block of land to plant what and how much, is implemented step by step and block by block. In this way, meetings are held, stakes are driven into the ground, and signatures are made on paper. Last year, grain, cotton, and oil did not complete the planting plan. Work is becoming more and more difficult, and with the support policies for agriculture becoming more and more difficult to implement, the momentum of agriculture has obviously weakened, and the trend of falling into stagnation is not obvious?"

The root of the problem: the need to thoroughly rectify prices; the current situation: only transitional measures can be taken.

The hard work put into grain production has resulted in reduced yields, while the effortless management has resulted in bumper harvests.

Lake County in Zhejiang Province is a high-yield area for grain, oil, silkworm cocoons, bamboo, and freshwater fish, among other agricultural products. Therefore, farmers have many ways to get rich. Vice Secretary of the Municipal Government Xu Zezheng sighed, "We have put the most effort into grain, but grain production has been decreasing in recent years, with reduced area, decreased multiple cropping index, degraded high-yield fields, and farmers are 'unable to not plant, unwilling to plant more, and unwilling to plant carefully.' However, the production of silkworm cocoons and freshwater fish has set new records every year, and we have not put in much effort. In fact, the amount of fertilizer used in mulberry fields is not small, and digging fish ponds is also very expensive, but farmers are willing to invest, and the supporting service system has also developed."

Li Zhaosheng, Deputy Commissioner of Wuzhou Region in Guangxi, provided a set of survey data: planting rice yields a net income of 256 yuan per mu, planting sugarcane yields 316 yuan, and planting seedless watermelon yields 628 yuan... He believes that from a long-term perspective, the situation of significant differences in comparative benefits will not change, and no matter what administrative orders are used, it will be difficult to make grain production get out of stagnation.

Of course, everyone knows that the price problem is very complicated, involving all aspects, and it is not something that can be rectified in a short time. However, can we take some transitional measures to slightly adjust the relationships of all parties?

Keep the price of agricultural materials and grain at a reasonable ratio.

Lu Quanzhong proposed that if the state finds it difficult to raise grain prices in the short term, can it find a way to keep agricultural production materials and grain at a stable and reasonable price ratio, limit the price increase of agricultural production materials, and make it not exceed the grain price increase. Now the price of agricultural production materials is rising too fast. According to the survey, one mu of land needs an investment of 70-90 yuan, and only when the grain yield per mu reaches more than 300 kilograms will there be a surplus. In this way, who will invest in grain fields?

Special policies should be given to key grain-exporting areas.

Ding Shiyin said that Jiaxing exports grain to the province, accounting for more than half of the province's total export, oil accounting for 60%, and silkworm cocoons accounting for 70%. Every year, these products contribute 200 million yuan in the form of price differences. In addition, purchasing more grain will also occupy more funds and bear more interest. If the state can adopt some special policies for the supply areas of basic agricultural products, especially key grain-exporting areas, such as giving appropriate consideration in financial contracts, or allowing them to exchange with grain-needing areas at equal prices, it can create a relatively relaxed environment for these areas in economic development and, to a certain extent, mobilize the enthusiasm of farmers.

Use credit and tax levers to adjust income differences.

Li Zhaosheng suggested that the Agricultural Bank of China should issue agricultural loans, and there should be a difference between those used for low-yield grain production and high-yield economic crops, and the interest rate should be differentiated. At the same time, it is necessary to levy an agricultural product income adjustment tax to adjust the significant income differences between planting different crops, so as to protect the enthusiasm of grain farmers.

The national situation is diverse and cannot be uniformly advanced; different regions can break through in their own ways.

Zhao Bugeng of the Agricultural and Industrial Department of Yancheng City, Jiangsu Province, believes that the so-called "stagnation" problem is a comprehensive symptom and cannot be expected to achieve a breakthrough in the overall situation with the proposal of a single measure.

In fact, appeals are appeals, and suggestions are suggestions. People have not been waiting for policies and money from above. Each place is looking for its own way to get out of or avoid stagnation. Even for the most difficult grain production, each place has its own strategies.

Use livestock to supplement grain, making the economic structure change from single to circular.

Li Fangxu, Secretary of the Municipal Committee of Zhaodong City, Heilongjiang Province, is betting on this: compared to 1983, the prices of three major agricultural production materials have increased by 75%, but during the same period, the prices of pork, eggs, and wool have increased by 108.7%. Developing animal husbandry can offset the price increase of the latter with the price increase of the former. According to calculations, the input-output ratio of grain is 1:1.93, and that of animal husbandry is 1:3.7. Using grain to raise livestock is equivalent to raising grain prices, and it can form a virtuous cycle of more livestock, more fertilizer, and more grain. It can also enrich agriculture, develop industry, and enrich the people, enhancing the ability of self-accumulation. A township has increased its sheep by 1.4 times and pigs by 46% in 10 years due to the development of animal husbandry, improved soil organic matter content, and increased grain by 2.5 times.

One is to relax, and the other is to support, using grain to supplement grain.

My method is simple, said County Magistrate Jia Shimao of Luonan. By "relax," I mean not to block, as long as the contract procurement task is completed, we support the liquor and starch factories to purchase, encourage farmers to transport grain out of the county, and sell it to Guanzhong or even Hubei and Henan to earn more money. Let farmers find back part of the loss when they sell the contract procurement grain through market transactions. By "support," I mainly mean to support the implementation of various grain-increasing measures. Farmers buy plastic film to plant grain, and a ton less requires 3,000 yuan, with loans and half-year interest subsidies; for agricultural land construction, one mu of land is built, and one yuan is given; the hybrid corn seeds produced by the county are sold to farmers at 10%-15% below the market price. This money must be spent.

Those who eat agricultural food must work hard, and all parties must supplement grain.

Among the 141 townships in Lake County, Zhejiang Province, 76 have established agricultural development funds. At the same time, funds are also raised from the supply and marketing cooperatives, grain departments, and migrant workers in the city. In addition, one yuan is taken from every 100 catties of cocoons and every 10,000 bricks, and then concentrated to solve the problem of aging water conservancy facilities, reward large grain sellers, and promote high-yield grain technology. The neighboring Jiaxing City also specially proposed that enterprises using agricultural products as raw materials and other units that eat agricultural food must contribute.

"Reverse the lute" to focus on tobacco, accumulate strength to support agriculture.

Bijie Region in Guizhou Province is an old, poor, and remote mountainous area with steep slopes, thin soil, and frequent disasters. 60% of the people have not solved the problem of food and clothing. Deputy Commissioner Chen Shengyuan said that in the past, we here had been practicing "grain first" for more than 30 years, opening up land from the foot of the mountain to the top of the mountain, but the result was still not enough grain and no money, and the area of water and soil loss increased to 53%. Bijie's grain production is greatly affected by natural disasters, but it has a climate and soil suitable for the growth of various economic crops, especially tobacco, with high yield and quality. In addition, there are more than 70 million mu of grasslands that are green all year round, and there is coal in every county. In recent years, we have reversed the lute, freeing up some grain fields to plant tobacco. Last year, 80% of the region's financial revenue came from the series of tobacco production. Now our poor region can allocate more than 10 million yuan to subsidize farmers to promote plastic film covering technology, develop hybrid corn, and build small reservoirs to improve irrigation conditions. Grain production requires strength.

No matter how stagnant, we cannot go back to the old road before the reform. Only by adhering to the direction of reform can we break through stagnation—this is the unanimous conclusion.

    “地方官”是怎么看待当前农业形势的？又有哪些突破徘徊的办法？前不久，在全国农村经济人才培训中心举办的“现代农村经济研讨会”期间，记者约请部分地、县管农业的干部座谈。他们分别来自我国经济的第一、二、三“世界”，谈的想法、办法值得一读。
　　“地方官”谈徘徊
    本报记者  江夏  吴长生
    大概念：徘徊主要是粮、棉，农村经济在发展
    农业难在粮食上，粮食又难在完成国家合同定购上
    浙江粮食主产区嘉兴市农经委主任丁师尹说，从嘉兴的实际看，农村经济并没有徘徊，难点集中在粮食生产上，难度最大的是国家合同定购部分。全国粮食合同定购数量连年调减，可是嘉兴不但没减，还因为大麦不算任务，实际上增加了稻谷的定购量。粮价低，定购任务重，生产资料又猛涨价，两头挤农民，他能高兴种粮吗？
    一季绝收也闹不了粮荒，调出粮吃亏，群众打埋伏
    陕西省洛南县过去是个穷县，过去年年都得几十卡车地从关中往回拉外出要饭的人。现在粮食不但够吃，还能调出，平均每年有１０００户农民的住房由土木结构变成砖木结构，人均储蓄的递增速度也上了两位数。县长贾仕淼介绍这些情况时显得很高兴：“从农民生活改善的速度看，农村经济形势不错，粮食上我们也没感到紧张。”说到这两年洛南粮食产量还没恢复到最高年产１．３９亿公斤的数时，贾仕淼算了一笔帐：要保证全县人的口粮、合同定购粮、６０万头猪、２０万只鸡的饲料和酒厂、淀粉厂的原料，没有１．４亿公斤粮食是不行的。而实际情况是，这两年不仅正常转着，而且就是一季不打粮，也不会闹粮荒，１９８６年因灾一季基本绝收，但顺顺当当过来了。问及县里怎么看群众报产量打埋伏，贾县长直率地说，商洛地区７个县，只有我们县没享受贫困县的优惠，全地区的３０００万公斤合同定购任务，我们扛了１０８７．５万公斤。现在我们人均收入还只有２７６元，县财政收入少得很，调出粮吃亏，要是在多调粮上当先进，吃苦的还不是老百姓？！
    持续增长的背后，的确隐藏着徘徊的危机
    地处河西走廊西端的甘肃省安西县是以种植业为主的农业县，有着旱涝保收的优越自然条件，近１０年粮食持续稳定增长，去年还比前年增长了３．９％。可是县委副书记卢全中并不怎么乐观：“不能光看粮食增产，还得看看粮食是怎么增的产。１９８６年以后，我们采取了许多大包干以前常用的非经济措施，一是思想教育，二是行政分派，哪块地种啥，种多少，逐级逐块落实。就这样大会小会地开着，地上钉桩，纸上画押，去年粮、棉、油还是没有完成种植计划。工作一年比一年难做，再加上支持农业的政策越来越难落实，农业的后劲已经明显不足，陷入徘徊境地的趋势不是明摆着吗？”
    根子上说：需要彻底理顺价格，近期状况：只能采取过渡措施
    下大功夫抓的却减产没费力气管的却丰收
    浙江湖州市是粮、油、蚕茧、毛竹、淡水鱼等多种农产品的高产区，因此农民致富的门路也多。市政府副秘书长徐泽政感叹道，我们下功夫最大的是粮食，可是粮食近几年还是在减产，面积减少，复种指数降低，高产田退化，农民是“不能不种，不想多种，不愿精种”。可是蚕茧、淡水鱼产量年年刷新纪录，我们并没费什么劲。其实桑地用肥不少，挖鱼塘也很花钱，但农民愿意投资，而且配套的服务体系也都发展起来了。
    广西梧州地区副专员李兆生提供了一组调查数字：种稻每亩年纯收入为２５６元，种甘蔗为３１６元，种无籽西瓜为６２８元……他认为，从长远看，比较利益悬殊的状况不改变，无论用什么行政命令，也难以使粮食生产走出徘徊。
    当然谁都知道，价格问题异常复杂，牵涉到方方面面，非短时间能够理顺。但是可不可以采取某些过渡性措施，对各方面的关系进行些微调呢？
    使农用物资与粮食保持合理比价
    卢全中提出，如果国家调高粮价一时有困难，能否想办法使农用生产资料与粮食保持稳定、合理的比价，限制农用生产资料的涨价幅度，使其不超过粮食涨价的幅度。现在农业生产资料价格涨得太猛，根据调查，一亩地需投入７０—９０元，粮食亩产达到３００公斤以上才有盈余，照这样，谁还往粮田投入呢？
    应给重点粮食调出区以特殊政策
    丁师尹说，嘉兴上调省里的粮食占全省调出总量的一半以上，油料占到６０％，蚕茧占７０％，每年这些产品以差价的形式贡献２亿元。此外，多购粮还要多占资金，多背利息。如果国家能够对基础农产品的供应地，特别是重点粮食调出区采取一些特殊政策，如在财政包干方面给以适当照顾，或允许他们与需要粮食的地区进行等价交换，就能使这些地区在经济发展上获得较为宽松的环境，在一定程度上调动农民积极性。
    运用信贷、税收杠杆调节收入差别
    李兆生建议，农业银行发放农业贷款，对用于收益较低的粮食生产和收益较高的经济作物应该有所区别，在利率上拉开档次。同时有必要征收农产品收入调节税，调节种植不同作物之间的悬殊收入，以保护粮农的积极性。
    全国情况千差万别难以齐头并进不同区域分头突破可以有所作为
    江苏盐城市农工部的赵步生认为，所谓“徘徊”的问题是综合症，不能指望某项措施的提出会带来全局性的突破。
    其实，呼吁归呼吁，建议归建议，人们并没有坐等上面给政策、给钱，各个地方都在寻找自己走出或避免徘徊的途径。就拿最难办的粮食生产来说，各地也都多少有自己的一点对策。
    以畜补粮，使经济结构由单一变环形
    黑龙江省肇东市委书记李方旭打的是这个算盘：与１９８３年相比，三项重要农用生产资料涨价７５％，可是同期，猪肉、鸡蛋、羊毛涨价１０８．７％，发展畜牧业，可以用后一个价格上涨抵消前一个价格上涨。据匡算，粮食的投入产出比为１∶１．９３，畜牧业为１∶３．７，以粮养畜等于粮食提价，并且能形成畜多、肥多、粮多的良性循环，还可以畜养农、兴工、富民，增强自我积累的能力。有一个乡由于发展畜牧业，１０年间羊增长１．４倍，猪增长４６％，土壤有机质含量提高，粮食也增加了２．５倍。
    一是放，二是扶，以粮补粮
    我的办法很简单，洛南的贾仕淼县长边说边解释，所谓“放”，就是不搞封锁，只要完成了合同定购任务，我们支持酒厂、淀粉厂收购，鼓励农民把粮食运出县境，贩到关中甚至湖北、河南去多赚些钱，让农民交售合同定购粮时损失的，通过市场交易找回一部分。所谓“扶”，主要是扶持各项粮食增产措施实施。农民买地膜种粮食，一吨少要３０００元，贷款还贴息半年；搞农田基建，修一亩田，给一元钱；县里自己搞的杂交玉米种，低于市场价１０％—１５％卖给农民。这个钱得舍得花。
    吃农业饭的都得出力，各方补粮
    浙江湖州市１４１个乡镇中已有７６个设立了农业发展基金，同时还向供销部门、粮食部门、进城劳动力等各方面筹集资金，另外还从每担茧和每万块砖中各提一元钱，然后集中起来，解决水利设施老化问题，奖励商品粮出售大户，推广粮食高产技术措施。与他们邻近的嘉兴市还特别提出，以农产品为原料的企业及其他吃农业饭的单位都要作贡献。
    “反弹琵琶”抓烟草，积蓄实力补农业
    贵州省毕节地区是老、少、边、穷山区，坡陡土薄，灾害频繁，６０％的人还没有解决温饱问题。副专员陈胜元说，过去我们这里搞了３０多年的“以粮为纲”，开荒从山脚开到山顶，结果还是粮不够、钱没有，水土流失面积反而增加到５３％。毕节种粮受自然灾害影响很大，可是有适合多种经济作物生长的气候、土壤，特别是烟草，产量高、质量也高。另外还有７００多万亩终年长草的草场，而且县县都有煤。近几年，我们来了个“反弹琵琶”，腾出部分粮田种烟草，去年全地区财政收入的８０％是来自种、烤、卷的烟草系列生产。现在我们这个穷地区一年能拿出上千万元补贴农民推广地膜覆盖技术，发展杂交玉米，建小水窖改善灌溉条件。抓粮食，得有实力。
    不管怎么徘徊，也不能走改革前的老路，只有坚持改革方向，才能突破徘徊——这是大家一致的结论。
