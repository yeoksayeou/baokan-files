Edition: 6

The banks of the Guantianping River in our town stretch for over twenty kilometers. For more than thirty years, the relevant departments and the town government have not organized the masses to plant a single tree along the riverbanks, nor have they repaired the river embankments. The 1,500 mu of land on both sides have been severely eroded by heavy rain and floods over the years, resulting in significant soil loss. Currently, the riverbed has expanded from its original width of over thirty meters to more than one hundred and fifty meters. If this situation continues, more arable land will be lost.

　　官田坪河两岸何时能变样
    我镇官田坪河长二十多公里。三十多年来，有关部门和镇政府没有组织群众在沿河两岸植一棵树，也从未修缮河坎。两岸的一千五百亩土地因长期受大雨和洪水冲蚀，土壤流失严重。现在，这条河的河床已由原来的三十多米扩展到一百五十多米。长此下去，良田还会减少。
