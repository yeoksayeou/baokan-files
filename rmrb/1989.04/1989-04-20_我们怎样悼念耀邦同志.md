The sudden passing of Comrade Hu Yaobang has left the nation in mourning. The vast majority of Communist Party members and the people, including intellectuals and student youth, are deeply shocked and grieved by the loss of an outstanding leader of the Party and the country, and a beloved mentor and friend. In recent days, people from all walks of life have organized or spontaneously held various mourning activities to express their sorrow.

The Central Committee of the Party has given a high evaluation of Comrade Hu Yaobang's brilliant life and decided to hold a solemn memorial service and farewell ceremony for his remains in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on April 22. The people of the entire nation will participate in this solemn mourning activity through radio and television, expressing their deepest condolences.

In mourning Comrade Hu Yaobang, the most important thing is to learn from his noble character, carry on his wishes, and complete the unfinished tasks he left behind.

Comrade Hu Yaobang dedicated his life to the cause of "modernizing the four areas and revitalizing China," always putting the overall situation of reform and modernization construction first.

In mourning Comrade Hu Yaobang, we should, like him, always put the overall situation first and do nothing that is detrimental to reform and modernization construction.

Comrade Hu Yaobang worked hard to advocate for socialist democracy and socialist legal system, and to maintain a stable and united political situation.

In mourning Comrade Hu Yaobang, we should, like him, do more beneficial work for the construction of socialist democracy and socialist legal system, and for maintaining a stable and united political situation, and do nothing that is detrimental to stability and unity.

Comrade Hu Yaobang has long been engaged in youth work, hoping that the youth will be full of vigor, disciplined, and become the backbone of socialist modernization construction. Our young comrades, in mourning Comrade Hu Yaobang, should strive to become the reliable talents he hoped for in the construction of the four modernizations, and do nothing that would cause pain to loved ones and joy to enemies.

However, a few individuals have used the pretext of mourning to engage in illegal activities directed against the Party and the government, even openly storming the Zhongnanhai gate. This is absolutely unacceptable. Maintaining a stable and united political situation is the highest interest of the people of the entire nation. Anyone who, for any reason, attempts to disrupt this, will be subject to legal punishment. Anyone who uses the mourning activities for Comrade Hu Yaobang to storm, smash, loot, and burn government offices will become a criminal of history. So far, the government has adopted a restrained attitude towards these few individuals' illegal activities. If someone takes the government's tolerance as a sign of weakness and persists in their actions, they will surely reap what they sow.

The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is the lifelong goal of Comrade Hu Yaobang. Anyone who, under the pretext of mourning Comrade Hu Yaobang, engages in activities detrimental to the realization of this goal, will not be able to rest in peace if Comrade Hu Yaobang knew. Let us turn our grief into strength and, on our respective posts, contribute with redoubled efforts to truly mourn Comrade Hu Yaobang!

　　我们怎样悼念耀邦同志
    本报评论员
    耀邦同志不幸与世长辞，举国哀悼。广大共产党员和人民群众，包括知识分子和青年学生，为党和国家失去了一位杰出的领导人，自己失去了一位良师益友，感到无比的震惊和悲痛。连日来，各界群众纷纷有组织地或自发地举行各种悼念活动，表达自己悲痛的心情。
    党中央对耀邦同志光辉的一生给予高度评价，并决定４月２２日在北京人民大会堂举行隆重的追悼大会和遗体告别仪式。全国人民将通过广播和电视的媒介身历其境地参与这一隆重的悼念活动，寄托自己的哀思。
    我们悼念耀邦同志，最重要的就是要学习耀邦同志的高尚品德，继承耀邦同志的遗愿，完成耀邦同志未竟的事业。
    耀邦同志为“实现四化，振兴中华”奉献了毕生的精力，处处以改革和四化建设的大局为重。
    我们悼念耀邦同志，就要像他那样处处以大局为重，不做任何不利于改革和四化建设的事。
    耀邦同志努力倡导社会主义民主和社会主义法制，维护安定团结的政治局面。
    我们悼念耀邦同志，就要像他那样为建设社会主义民主和社会主义法制，为维护安定团结的政治局面多做有益的工作，绝不做任何不利于安定团结的事。
    耀邦同志长期做青年工作，希望青年朝气蓬勃，遵守纪律，成为社会主义现代化建设的生力军。我们的青年同志悼念耀邦同志，就要努力把自己造就成他所希望的四化建设的可靠人才，绝不做使亲者痛、仇者快的事。
    但是，有少数人以悼念为名进行把矛头指向党和政府的违法活动，甚至公然冲击新华门，这是绝对不能允许的。维护安定团结的政治局面是全国人民的最高利益，任何人以任何借口企图加以破坏，都要受到法律的制裁。谁若是利用悼念耀邦同志的活动对党政机关进行冲、砸、抢、烧，他就将成为历史的罪人。迄今为止，政府对这极少数人的违法活动一直采取克制的态度。如果有人把政府的容忍看作是软弱的表现，一意孤行，必将自食其果。
    实现中华民族的伟大复兴，是胡耀邦同志毕生奋斗的目标，任何人假借悼念耀邦同志的名义做出不利于实现这一目标的行为，耀邦同志如果泉下有知，也是不能安息的。让我们化悲痛为力量，在各自的岗位上以加倍努力贡献的实际行动来悼念耀邦同志吧！
