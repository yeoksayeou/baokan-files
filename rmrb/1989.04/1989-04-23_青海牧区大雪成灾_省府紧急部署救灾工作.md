Since mid-February, heavy snow has been falling continuously in the pastoral areas of Qinghai Province. In some regions, the snow accumulation has reached over one foot, causing disruptions in transportation and resulting in the deaths of large numbers of lambs and adult livestock.

The Qinghai Provincial People's Government has urgently deployed disaster relief efforts. The directors of the provincial departments of animal husbandry and civil affairs have arrived at the scene to oversee the relief operations. A large quantity of fodder, bran, diesel, relief funds, and other supplies have been transported to the affected areas.
