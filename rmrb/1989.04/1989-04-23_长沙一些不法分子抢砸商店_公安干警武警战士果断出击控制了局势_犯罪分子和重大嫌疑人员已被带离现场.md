On the evening of April 22, from 7 PM to the early hours of April 23, a serious incident occurred in Changsha City where groups of criminals rampaged through Wuyi Road and Huangxing Road, assaulting police officers and civilians, smashing stores, and looting property.

In the evening of April 22, several thousand people gradually gathered at Wuyi Square in Changsha City, causing traffic congestion and disorder. In areas such as the Railway Station Square, in front of the Provincial Government, Butterfly Building, and Wuyi Square, large crowds gathered along Wuyi Road. Some criminals began to incite trouble. Around 7 PM, a group of criminals first shouted and smashed the windows of a car parked at Wuyi Square. They then broke into a newsstand on the square, scattering newspapers and magazines everywhere. Subsequently, this group of criminals smashed the windows and doors of a noodle shop on the east side of Wuyi Square, destroying the counters and tables, forcing the shop to close. Meanwhile, the doors and windows of some nearby stores were also damaged. Around 9 PM, the situation worsened. A group of criminals, while attacking and assaulting police officers, proceeded to smash and loot stores along Wuyi Road and Huangxing Road, overturning and stealing cars, creating chaos.

Following the orders from the Hunan Provincial Party Committee and Government, the Changsha Public Security Bureau, with the support of the Hunan Armed Police Corps, took decisive action. After intense efforts, 89 criminals and major suspects were taken away from the scene, quickly restoring order and normalcy.

According to preliminary statistics from the Changsha Public Security Bureau, during the serious incident of smashing, looting, and assaulting on April 22, a total of 38 state-owned, collective, and individual stores were damaged and looted. One car was overturned and damaged, two cars were hijacked and abandoned midway, and seven police officers were severely injured, resulting in property losses amounting to over 808,000 yuan.

Today, the Changsha Municipal Government issued a notice. The notice stated that criminals involved in smashing, looting, and arson must be firmly struck down. A small number of criminals involved in these activities must quickly surrender themselves. The notice calls on all citizens to focus on production, work, and study, jointly maintaining social order and a stable, united environment.

On the evening of April 22, in bustling areas such as Wuyi Square and the Railway Station in Changsha City, there were continuous incidents of criminals smashing and looting stores. Preliminary statistics show that 38 stores were damaged and looted, with some stores completely ransacked.
