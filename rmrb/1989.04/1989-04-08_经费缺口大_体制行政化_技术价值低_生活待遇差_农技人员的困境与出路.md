The phrase "From afar, they look like beggars; up close, they look like charcoal sellers; a closer look reveals they are from the agricultural technology promotion station" is a somewhat exaggerated description of grassroots agricultural technicians, but it does reflect some of their current circumstances. Recently, the authors conducted a survey of agricultural science and technology personnel in Shaanxi Province, where such personnel are relatively concentrated.

Funding is extremely tight. This was the first impression gained from the survey. In 1979, the province's fiscal revenue was 1.9 billion yuan, and the operational funds allocated to agricultural units were 350 million yuan; by 1985, the province's fiscal revenue had increased to 2.7 billion yuan, but the operational funds for agricultural units had decreased to 270 million yuan. Taking the Shaanxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences as an example, for many years, the per capita operational funds have been 1,800 yuan, and after deducting salaries and subsidies, there is very little left for research. Starting from the previous year, the province has added 10 million yuan annually to the academy, increasing the per capita operational funds to 2,500 yuan. However, due to the large amount of arrears from previous years, the gap remains significant. The conditions in local and county agricultural research institutes are even worse. Some have only 3 yuan per month for travel expenses, and some do not even have money to buy ink. Some technicians have to use their own money to buy supplies. Most agricultural research institutes lack basic instruments and equipment, and even if they have some, they are outdated and highly inaccurate. Without instruments, agricultural technicians cannot fully utilize their skills.

The administrative nature of the scientific research system severely restricts the hands and feet of agricultural technicians. Although various research and technical units have implemented many internal reforms and made some progress in certain areas, the new system has not yet been fully established, and the old system is still in effect, essentially maintaining a "big pot" system. Due to restrictions from factors such as personnel quotas, material conditions, and public opinion, it is difficult to optimize personnel allocation and rationalize talent flow. Those who are needed cannot come in, and those who are not suitable do not want to leave, lacking the ability for self-regulation and the internal drive to serve economic construction. Job promotions still largely depend on seniority, with everyone advancing at the same pace. In evaluations, there is a bias towards research over management and publications over practical work, leading many science and technology personnel to be unwilling to go to the grassroots level or engage in management and leadership.

The irrational price system for agricultural products leads to a mismatch between agricultural technology investment and returns, lacking the driving force for technological progress. Due to the influence of various factors such as seasons and climate, the research cycle for agricultural science and technology achievements is long, the investment is large, and it embodies more labor from science and technology personnel, which should yield relatively high technical returns. However, in reality, although agricultural science and technology achievements have significant economic benefits at the macro level, the economic benefits at the micro level are not significant, so farmers do not urgently need these technologies. If the service is provided free of charge, farmers are relatively welcoming, but if the service is charged, except for a few economic crops, technical services for major crops are not feasible. County and township governments urgently need agricultural technology, but due to economic constraints, paid service contracts often cannot be fulfilled, causing the fledgling technology market to shrink, and many agricultural science and technology personnel have to change careers, resulting in a waste of talent.

The working conditions for agricultural technicians are harsh, leading to a series of social problems. Agricultural research and technology promotion departments are generally located in suburban or township areas. The most prominent problem is that young science and technology personnel have difficulty finding partners, and even if they find someone from outside, due to the difficulty of transferring jobs, they have to change careers and leave. The lack of employment opportunities for children is the most significant factor affecting mid-career and young science and technology personnel. For example, the Shaanxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences alone has over 200 unemployed youth, some families have two or three unemployed members, and some have been unemployed for three to five years, becoming a heavy burden for science and technology personnel. This causes the social status of agricultural science and technology personnel to continuously decline, reflected in higher agricultural colleges as a sharp decrease in the number of students applying to agricultural majors. According to statistics from a certain agricultural college, in 1982, 80% of students chose this college as their first or second choice, but by 1986, this number had dropped to 12%.

Experts believe that to solve these problems, we should start from the "big picture" and formulate corresponding policies and regulations to truly respect knowledge and talent through compensation. In terms of agriculture, which is a "small picture," we should quickly increase investment in agricultural science and technology. Currently, almost all countries in the world conduct agricultural research through the state, and even the United States, which has the most developed agriculture, does so. Due to national conditions, the commercialization of agricultural science and technology in China will not be rapid, so the main investment in agricultural science and technology should come from the state. In the future, the development of agriculture will depend to a certain extent on the state's investment in agricultural science and technology. Next, we should consider formulating a series of regulations and corresponding supporting policies for agricultural technology units, deepening reforms, fully tapping into talent potential, supporting the initiation of research topics, and optimizing the combination of principal investigators and participants through mutual selection. The key is to have leaders who dare to take the lead in reforms and provide them with necessary legal protection. On this basis, we should encourage and support agricultural technicians to engage in self-employment and generate income while completing state tasks and not affecting normal research. We should allow agricultural technology units to operate some production materials that match their technology, continuously developing and strengthening their scientific and technological capabilities, forming a virtuous cycle, and better serving agricultural production.

　　经费缺口大　体制行政化　技术价值低　生活待遇差
    农技人员的困境与出路
    蒋建科　王玉堂
    “远看像要饭的，近看像卖炭的，仔细看是农技推广站的”。这是时下对基层农技人员的一种夸张描述，却也在一定程度上反映了目前农技人员的一些境况。最近，笔者在我国农业科技人员较集中的陕西省对农技人员进行了一次调查。
    经费太紧。这是调查获得的第一个印象。１９７９年，该省财政收入是１９亿元，给农业单位的事业费是３．５亿元；１９８５年，省财政收入增加到２７亿元，给农业单位的事业费却减少到２．７亿元。以省农科院为例，多年来人均事业费一直是１８００元，除去工资和补贴外，没有多少钱用来搞科研。从前年起，省里每年给该院追加１００万元，人均事业费达到２５００元，但因以前欠账过多，缺口仍较大。各地、县农科所条件更差，有的每月出差费只有３元钱，甚至连买墨水的钱都没有，个别技术人员只得自己掏腰包去买。大部分农科所缺少基本的仪器设备，即使有，也已陈旧，精确性极差。可离开仪器，农技人员便无法施展本领。
    科研体制行政化的局面严重束缚了农技人员的手脚。虽然各科研、技术单位都在内部搞了不少改革，某些方面有了进步，但新的体制尚未完全建立，旧体制仍在起作用，基本上还是“大锅饭”。由于受编制、物质条件、社会舆论诸多因素限制，人员优化组合、人才合理流动无法搞起来，想要的人进不来，不合适的人不想走，缺乏自我调节能力和为经济建设服务的内在动力。晋升职称仍旧看年限，齐步走，在评审中还存在重科研轻管理、重论文轻实践的偏向，导致许多科技人员不愿下基层，不愿搞管理当领导。
    农产品价格体系不合理，导致农业科技投入与收益失衡，对技术进步缺乏推动力。由于受季节、气候等多种因素影响，农业科技成果的研制周期长，投资大，凝结着科技人员更多的劳动，理应得到较高的技术报酬。但实际上，尽管农业科技成果在宏观上有非常显著的经济效益，可在微观上的经济效益不显著，因而农户对这些技术的需求并不迫切。如果搞无偿服务，农户还比较欢迎，若搞有偿服务，除个别经济作物外，大宗作物的技术服务根本行不通。县、乡两级政府虽然急需农业技术，但限于经济条件，有偿服务合同往往不能兑现，使得刚刚兴起的一点技术市场又萎缩下去，许多农业科技人员不得不改行，造成人才浪费。
    农技人员工作条件艰苦，引出一系列社会问题。农业科研、技术推广部门一般都在城郊、乡镇，青年科技人员找对象难是最突出的问题，即使在外地找到，因不好调动工作，也只好改行调走。子女就业机会少则是影响中青年科技人员的最主要因素，仅省农科院就有待业青年２００多人，有的一家有两、三个待业的，有的已待业三、五年，成为科技人员沉重的包袱。这使农业科技人员的社会地位不断下降，反映到高等农业院校，表现在报考农学类院校的学生数量在锐减。据某农学院统计，１９８２年，第一、二志愿报考该院的考生高达８０％，到１９８６年已降到１２％。
    有关专家认为，要解决这些问题，首先应从“大气候”上着手，制定相应政策法规，真正从报酬上尊重知识、尊重人才。从农业这个“小气候”上讲，应尽快增加对农业科技的投资。目前世界各国几乎都是国家办农业科研，连农业最发达的美国也是如此。限于国情，我国农业科技商品化的速度不会很快，因此，农业的科技投资主要由国家承担，今后农业的发展在一定程度上取决于国家给农业科技的投入。其次应考虑给农技单位制定一系列法规和相应的配套政策，深化改革，充分挖掘人才潜力，支持课题主持人开题论证，主持人与参与人要实行优化组合，双向自由选择。这中间，关键是要有敢于带头改革的领导者并对其进行必要的法律保护。在此基础上，应鼓励支持农技人员在完成国家任务、不影响正常科研的同时，利用自己的优势自营创收；允许农技单位经营一些与技术配套的生产资料，不断发展、壮大科技力量，形成良性循环，更好地为农业生产提供服务。
