The Nanjing municipal government recently announced that 10 state-owned enterprises, including the Nanjing Second Machine Tool Factory, will serve as pilot programs for open management.

The 10 state-owned enterprises undergoing this reform will have expanded personnel, financial, and operational management powers compared to the past. The aspects that most interest the factory directors and managers include: enterprises have the right to decide on organizational structures and staffing according to the principle of "lean and efficient" management; under the premise of adhering to macro-industrial policies and economic plans, enterprises have the right to independently use post-tax profits for technological upgrades; enterprises have the right to adjust or even reject mandatory plans that lack material, energy guarantees, or demand-side assurances; enterprises have the right to independently decide whether to participate in various evaluations, inspections, and other activities.

While announcing this reform, the Nanjing municipal government emphasized that open management is not about giving these enterprises special treatment or neglecting them. Instead, it aims to push enterprises to the forefront of the market, allowing them to strengthen internal management and adjust their product structures directly under the pressures and risks of the market.

　　建立放开经营试点  南京十国营企业扩权
    新华社南京４月３日电  （记者费强）日前南京市政府宣布，南京第二机床厂等１０家国营企业作为试点实行放开经营。
    进行这项改革的１０家国营企业，人权、财权和生产经营权都比过去有所扩大。其中最令厂长、经理们感兴趣的是：企业有权根据“精干高效”的原则自行决定机构设置和人员编制；在符合宏观产业政策和经济规划的前提下，企业有权自主使用税后留利进行技术改造；企业有权调整直至拒绝没有物资、能源保证或没有需方的指令性计划；企业有权自主决定是否参与各类评比检查及其它活动等。
    南京市政府负责人在宣布这项改革的同时，强调放开经营不是在政策上给这些企业“吃小灶”，更不是对它们不管，而是为了把企业推到市场第一线，让企业直接在风险和压力下加强内部管理，调整自身的产品结构。
