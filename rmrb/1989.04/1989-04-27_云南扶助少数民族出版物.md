The Standing Committee of the Yunnan Provincial People's Congress recently approved the "Yunnan Province Publishing Management Regulations," which will come into effect on May 1, 1989. The regulations provide support for the publication of materials by minority nationalities. The regulations stipulate the following special policies: priority arrangement for the publication and printing of works by authors from minority nationalities; units engaged in the publishing, printing, and distribution of books and periodicals in minority nationalities' scripts can apply for tax reductions or exemptions; publishing houses and periodical publishers that primarily publish books and periodicals in minority nationalities' scripts can have their subject matter slightly relaxed.
