A veteran revolutionary and steadfast communist, an outstanding leader of the nation and the military, a distinguished revolutionary and military strategist of the proletariat, an exceptional military commander of our army, and a principal founder of the People's Navy, Xiao Jinguang, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Fifth National People's Congress, passed away in Beijing on March 29, 1989, at 18:25, due to illness. He was 86 years old.

Comrade Xiao Jinguang spent nearly 70 years in the revolutionary cause, enduring hardships and setbacks, daring to innovate, and dedicating himself wholeheartedly. He made outstanding contributions to the liberation of the Chinese people and the construction of socialism. His passing is a significant loss for our Party and our military. Xiao Jinguang was born on January 4, 1903, in Zhao Zhou Port, Changsha, Hunan Province, into a poor family of small craftsmen. In his youth, he read progressive publications and sought truth. During the May Fourth Movement, he actively participated in the anti-imperialist student movement at Changsha Changyuan Middle School and was inspired by revolutionary ideas. He admired the Russian October Socialist Revolution and in 1920 joined the Hunan Russian Research Society founded by Comrade Mao Zedong and others. In August of the same year, he entered the "Foreign Language Society" established by the Shanghai Communist Group to study, and that year joined the Socialist Youth League. In the spring of 1921, he and Comrades Liu Shaoqi and Ren Bishi, among others, endured countless hardships and traveled to the Soviet Union, entering the Communist University of the Toilers of the East in Moscow. During his studies, he expressed his desire to engage in military work and was sent to a military school for a year of training. In January 1922, he attended the First Congress of Far Eastern Communist and National Revolutionary Organizations. In late 1922, he transferred from the Youth League to the Party. In January 1924, as a representative of the Eastern peoples, he stood guard over Comrade Lenin's coffin. In the autumn of the same year, Comrade Xiao Jinguang returned to China from the Soviet Union and worked in the Anshan coal mine, organizing the workers' movement. In the winter of 1925, he served as the Party representative of the 6th Division of the 2nd Army of the National Revolutionary Army, dedicating himself to the revolutionary transformation of the old army. During the Northern Expedition's campaigns in Jiangxi, Minbei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Xihu, he was on the front lines, leading by example, and made active contributions to the victory of the Northern Expedition and the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. After the failure of the Revolution in 1927, Comrade Xiao Jinguang returned to the Soviet Union and studied at the Leningrad Military Political Academy. In the autumn of 1930, he returned to China and served as the Chief of Staff and Political Commissar of the Fujian-Jiangxi-Gan Military Region, and concurrently as the Principal of the Pengyang Military Academy in Minxi. He applied the military knowledge he had learned to the actual construction of the Red Army, learning from war to explore strategies and tactics suitable for China, and participated in the command of the anti-"encirclement" campaigns in Minxi. In the winter of 1931, he served as the Principal of the Central Military Political Academy. During this period, he translated the "Field Regulations" of the Soviet Red Army. In 1932, Comrade Xiao Jinguang served as the Political Commissar of the 5th Red Army Corps, successfully transforming the Nationalist troops that participated in the "Ningdu Uprising" into a combat-ready force for the people's army through outstanding political work. He led his troops in the campaigns of Ganzhou and Shuikou, and later moved north to establish the bases of Jianning, Lichuan, and Taiping. From 1933 onwards, he successively served as the Commander of the Jianli Tai Defense Area and Political Commissar of the 11th Red Army, and the Commander of the Fujian-Jiangxi Military Region and Political Commissar of the 7th Red Army Corps. He did a great deal of effective work in creating and developing revolutionary bases. In 1934, under the influence of the "Left" adventurism within the Party, Comrade Xiao Jinguang was falsely accused of being a representative of the "Lu Ming line" in the military and was wrongly expelled from the Party and sentenced to five years in prison. In adversity, he believed in the Party and remained steadfast in his convictions, enduring humiliation and hardship for the revolutionary cause. After being released from detention, he first taught military science at the Red Army University and later served as the Director of the Political Department. During the Long March, he served as the Commander of the Senior Cadres Regiment of the Military Commission's Cadres Regiment. After the Zunyi Conference, the Central Committee rectified the wrong treatment of Comrade Xiao Jinguang. In June 1935, he was appointed Chief of Staff of the 3rd Red Army Corps.

During the War of Resistance against Japan, Comrade Xiao Jinguang successively served as the Director of the Eighth Route Army Rear Guard Headquarters, Commander of the Guard Corps, and Deputy Commander of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-Jin-Sui Border Defense Army. During this period, he, in accordance with the spirit of the Gutian Conference resolution, organized the Guard Corps, led the troops to successfully complete the anti-bandit task in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, and stabilized the order in the border region; he repelled dozens of attacks by the Japanese invaders and defended the thousand-mile river defense. Under the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, he handled many sharp and complex issues in the anti-friction struggle in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. He repeatedly did the work of General Deng Baoshan and other high-ranking Kuomintang officers, effectively winning over the intermediate forces. He also, together with Comrade Wang Ruofei, negotiated with Yan Xishan to resolve the "Jinxi Incident" and promote the signing of the peace agreement. To break the Kuomintang's blockade of the border region, he led by example, leading the troops to be self-reliant, well-clothed, and well-fed, and launched a vigorous mass production movement. He also paid attention to the study of military theory and was committed to the regularization of the army. In the Guard Corps, he advocated separating tactics from technology in military training methods, opening various military and political training classes and research classes to cultivate cadres. He published many articles in the "Eighth Route Army Military and Political Magazine" and other publications. His "Close Combat Tactics" was published as a military textbook. Some basic views in his "Guidelines for Guerrilla Warfare" were adopted by Comrade Mao Zedong. He made important contributions to the defense of the Party Central Committee, the defense of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Base Area, and the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan. In 1945, Comrade Xiao Jinguang participated in the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China and was elected as an alternate member of the Central Committee.

During the War of Liberation, Comrade Xiao Jinguang served as the Deputy Commander-in-Chief and Chief of Staff of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army. In October 1946, he concurrently served as the Commander of the South Manchuria Military Region. He resolutely implemented the strategic guidelines and various policies formulated by the Central Committee and the Military Commission, and together with Comrade Chen Yun, led the struggle to defend the South Manchuria Base Area. He used flexible and mobile strategies and tactics to command the famous "Four Defenses of Lianjiang" campaign, making important contributions to changing the strategic situation in the Northeast. In 1947, he commanded the troops to participate in the summer and autumn offensives. In May 1948, he concurrently served as the Commander of the First Line Siege Command of the Northeast Field Army (later the First Army Group), and together with Comrade Xiao Hua, led the troops to besiege Changchun, using military encirclement, economic blockade, and political subversion to win the surrender of the 60th Army of the Kuomintang and force the remaining garrison troops to surrender completely. After the Liaoshen Campaign ended, he led five columns of the Northeast Field Army into the pass, successfully completing the task of cutting off the Beijing-Tianjin corridor and cooperating with neighboring troops to besiege Beijing. After the Pingjin Campaign, Comrade Xiao Jinguang served as the Commander and Political Commissar of the 12th Army Group of the Fourth Field Army. In March 1949, he led the Fourth Field Army's advance guard to the south to participate in the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign, effectively pinning down the forces of Bai Chongxi, and securing the victory of the Second and Third Field Armies from the flank. Later, he participated in the work of promoting and encouraging the surrender of Peng Xuan and Chen Mingren. After the peaceful liberation of Changsha, he concurrently served as the Commander of the Hunan Military Region. In the famous Hengyang-Baoding Campaign, he commanded six armies and 19 divisions to undertake the main attack mission, annihilating four main force divisions of Bai Chongxi, making important contributions to the advance into Guangxi and the liberation of South China.

At the end of 1949, Comrade Xiao Jinguang was ordered to establish the leadership of the People's Liberation Army Navy. In January 1950, he served as the Commander of the Navy. In 1954, he served as the Deputy Minister of National Defense. In 1955, he was awarded the rank of Admiral of the Navy and the First Class August First Medal, First Class Independence and Freedom Medal, and First Class Liberation Medal. He was a member of the First, Second, and Third National Defense Committees, a member of the Standing Committee of the Third and Fourth National People's Congress, a Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Fifth National People's Congress, a member of the Eighth to Eleventh Central Committees of the Communist Party of China, and in 1982, he was elected as a Standing Committee member of the Central Advisory Commission. In 1988, he was awarded the First Class Red Star Medal of Honor.

During his tenure as the Commander of the Navy, Comrade Xiao Jinguang presided over the formulation of a series of principles and guidelines for the construction of the Navy, dedicating himself wholeheartedly to the construction of the People's Navy. In the early stages of the establishment of the Navy, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission, he and other leaders overcame the difficulties of funding, lack of talent, and lack of experience, and completed the establishment of the Navy in a short period, initially forming a coastal defense system. He paid attention to learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, referring to the development status of navies around the world, and based on the first-hand materials from extensive field surveys of China's coasts, he presided over the formulation of a development plan for the People's Navy based on China's national conditions. He respected knowledge and gathered talents, presiding over the determination of the organizational principle of "under the absolute leadership of the Communist Party, with workers and peasants as the backbone, with the PLA as the foundation, absorbing a large number of revolutionary young intellectuals and scientific and technical personnel, and striving to unite and reform the original naval personnel to jointly build the people's navy," and proposed to build a strong political thought, organization, and technology "pillar." He started from the reality of the high technology and multi-service nature of the Navy, attaching importance to the construction of academies, personally serving as the Principal of the First Naval Academy, leading the naval officers and soldiers to advance towards culture and science and technology, quickly completing the transformation from the army to the navy, and in the process of establishing and fighting, cooperating with the army and air force, recovered all the coastal islands except Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Matsu. He worked hard to study and explore the development strategy of the People's Navy. In the 1950s, he proposed the construction policy of "focusing on air, submarine, and fast, with submarines as the key point" and "building a modern, powerful, near-sea, light-type naval combat force" based on the actual situation of our army, and the idea of carrying out naval guerrilla warfare. At the end of the 1950s, he aimed at the new developments in world navies, leading the determination of the guiding principles of "the operational sea area from near-sea to mid-sea, to far-sea and ocean; the construction of ships from medium and small to large," and "implementing the combination of advanced technology and conventional equipment," which had long-term guiding significance, and made unremitting efforts to promote the improvement of the Navy's equipment and weapons to a higher level. Facing the severe difficulties brought by the three years of economic difficulties in China, the withdrawal of Soviet experts, and the tearing up of contracts, as well as the interference and destruction of the Cultural Revolution, he did not slack off, focusing on the construction of the Navy, and promoting the research and development of new weapons and equipment for the Navy. In the 1970s, he proposed to the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission several times, based on the current international situation and the development of China's science and technology and the need for marine development, that "the construction of the Navy should, while strengthening near-sea defense capabilities, actively and timely develop mid-sea and far-sea combat forces." He paid great attention to improving the combat effectiveness of the troops, repeatedly emphasizing that "building naval combat forces should be the focus of all our work." He went to the Naval System of the Military Academy of the Liberation Army to conduct in-depth learning, seriously studying and researching Comrade Mao Zedong's strategic and tactical thoughts, drawing on the historical experience of domestic and foreign naval wars, and going to the ship and coastal defense front lines to investigate and research, further improving the naval operational guidance thoughts. He made indelible contributions to the growth of the People's Navy from nothing to a considerable scale of naval combat force.

From 1962 onwards, Comrade Xiao Jinguang was attacked by Lin Biao and was falsely accused of "not making the four firsts the first, but the four seconds," "pure military viewpoint," and "opposing the prominence of politics." During the Cultural Revolution, under the persecution of Lin Biao and his accomplice Li Zuopeng and others, he was wrongly criticized and deprived of his power to lead the Navy's work. After the "September 13th Incident" in 1971, he resumed his leadership of the Navy's work, actively released cadres who were persecuted during the Cultural Revolution, and was committed to the revitalization and development of various work in the Navy. However, he was again attacked and persecuted by the Jiang Qing counter-revolutionary clique, being falsely accused of "getting on the boat of Lin Biao," causing severe damage to his body and mind. In 1979, under the care of Comrades Deng Xiaoping, Ye Jianying, and Chen Yun, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China completely rectified the political frame-up against Comrade Xiao Jinguang.

Throughout his life, Comrade Xiao Jinguang experienced countless dangers, but he remained loyal to the Party and the people, with a firm communist faith and an unyielding spirit of struggle, with an iron will and a loyal heart. During the Cultural Revolution, he always cared about the future and fate of the Party and the country, and fought resolutely against the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counter-revolutionary cliques. At the time of the election of the Central Political Bureau at the Ninth Plenary Session of the Ninth Central Committee, he resolutely did not vote for Jiang Qing, Ye Qun, Li Zuopeng, Qiu Huizuo, Wu Faxian, Wang Hongwen, Zhang Chunqiao, and Yao Wenyuan. In September and October 1976, he twice met with Comrade Ye Jianying, discussing important suggestions for the overthrow of the "Gang of Four." He firmly advocated the rectification of the "Tiananmen Incident" and advocated that respected old comrades return to work. He wholeheartedly supported the line, policies, and guidelines of the Party's Eleventh Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee. Even in his illness, he was always concerned about the country's efforts to improve the economic environment and rectify the economic order, and about the construction of the People's Navy.

Throughout his life, Comrade Xiao Jinguang engaged in many pioneering works and made significant contributions to the revolutionary cause. However, he was modest and prudent, seeking truth from facts, considering the overall situation, strictly observing discipline, and possessing the noble character and moral cultivation of a proletarian revolutionary. He approached his work with a high sense of responsibility and dedication to the revolutionary cause, was selfless, had a rigorous style, united with comrades, and was upright and unyielding. He started from reality, was diligent in learning, daring to explore, attached importance to investigation and research, was good at summarizing experience, and creatively completed various major tasks entrusted by the Party. In his later years, he worked tirelessly on the writing of his memoirs, leaving a precious spiritual legacy for the Party. He devoted his life to the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people and to the construction of the People's Navy, and practiced the oath to struggle for communism all his life. His lofty character and outstanding achievements will forever be recorded in history.

Comrade Xiao Jinguang will be forever remembered!

    肖劲光同志一生从事了许多开创性的工作，为革命事业做出了重大贡献。但他有功不居功，一贯谦虚谨慎，实事求是，顾全大局，严守纪律，具有高尚的无产阶级革命家的风范和品德修养。他以高度的革命事业心和责任感对待工作，大公无私，作风严谨，团结同志，刚正不阿。他一切从实际出发，勤于学习，勇于探索，注重调查研究，善于总结经验，创造性地完成了党所交付的各项重大任务。晚年他孜孜不倦地从事于回忆录的写作，为党留下了一笔宝贵的精神财富。他把毕生的精力献给了中国人民的革命事业，献给了人民海军的建设事业，身体力行地实践了为共产主义事业奋斗终生的誓言。他的崇高品德和卓著功勋，将永远彪炳史册。
