After 30 years of effort, China's isotope and nuclear radiation industry has formed a complete system. Currently, China can produce over 800 types of isotopes, and the application of isotopes and radiation technology has spread across various fields of national economic and social development.

Currently, there are over 100 units nationwide engaged in isotope and radiation research and production. If major production, service, and application units are included, the number exceeds 2,000. There are 4 nuclear reactors and 4 accelerators nationwide used for isotope production; over 50 types of nuclear instruments are in use, among which the annual production of ion smoke fire alarms reaches over 80,000 units.

Radiation processing has developed rapidly in recent years and has become a promising industry. There are over 150 cobalt-60 irradiation facilities nationwide, with over 20 of them having industrial production scale. There are 25 accelerators for irradiation purposes. These facilities are mainly used in radiation chemistry, radiation sterilization, pest control, food preservation, and other fields. The state has approved health standards for 8 types of irradiated foods.

A relatively complete nuclear agriculture network has been established nationwide. A total of 285 new varieties have been cultivated using radiation technology, ranking at the forefront globally. There are over 1,000 medical units nationwide applying nuclear technology, treating over 10 million patients annually.

　　我能生产八百多种同位素  辐射技术广泛应用各领域
    据新华社北京４月７日电  经过３０年的努力，我国的同位素和核辐射行业已经形成体系。目前我国已能生产８００多种同位素，同位素和辐射技术的应用已遍及国家经济社会发展的各个领域。
    目前，全国从事同位素与辐射研究开发生产的单位有１００多家，如包括主要生产性服务和应用单位，则有２０００多家。全国已有用于生产同位素的反应堆４座，加速器４台；应用核仪器５０多种，其中离子感烟式火灾报警器的年产量已达到８万多个。
    辐射加工近年来发展迅速，成为一个很有前景的产业。全国已建有各种类型钴—６０辐照装置１５０余座，其中具有工业生产规模的２０多个。辐照用加速器已建成２５台。它们主要用于辐射化工、辐照消毒、杀虫灭菌、食品保鲜等。国家已批准８种辐照食品的卫生标准。
    全国建立了比较完善的核农业网络。采用辐射技术培育出的新品种有２８５个，居世界领先地位。应用核技术的医疗单位全国已有１０００多个。每年接受病人１０００万人次。
