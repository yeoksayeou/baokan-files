There are currently about 1,800 artificial satellites orbiting in space, and 150 countries are using space communications. The "International Space Station," which can accommodate people and conduct scientific experiments, is expected to be completed by the end of this century. The prospects for the peaceful use of outer space are bright.

With the rapid development of aerospace technology, how to use space technology to serve humanity has become a concern for all countries. The United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space's Scientific and Technical Subcommittee discussed this issue a month ago and designated 1992 as the "International Space Year." So, what is the current state and future prospects of humanity's development of space?

Inspiring Achievements

In recent months, humanity has made inspiring achievements in the field of aerospace:

On March 18, the U.S. space shuttle "Discovery," carrying five astronauts, returned safely. This was the second time "Discovery" had ventured into space since September of last year. The successful resumption of space flights by the U.S. after a two-and-a-half-year hiatus indicates that the quality and safety of its space shuttles have significantly improved.

On November 15 of last year, the Soviet Union launched its first large, practical-type space shuttle, "Buran," unmanned, using a fully automatic control system for flight and landing. The "Energia" rocket that launched it is the most powerful booster rocket in the world. Following this, on December 22, two Soviet astronauts returned safely after spending 336 days in space. This is unprecedented. It shows that humans can live and work in space for extended periods.

Additionally, Western European countries successfully launched the Ariane-4 LP rocket and simultaneously placed three satellites into orbit; China successfully launched the Long March-4 rocket. All of these developments have attracted the attention of the global aerospace community.

Exploring Outer Space

The space industry has two main aspects: exploring outer space to develop it, and observing the Earth to protect and utilize it. Both will benefit humanity.

The Sun has a direct impact on the existence of the Earth and human life, so to explore the mysteries of the universe, it is natural to first observe the Sun and the solar system and study whether the solar system will be suitable for human survival in the future. The Soviet Union launched the "Phobos" spacecraft to observe the Sun in July of last year. Currently, it is flying normally.

In addition to Earth, of the other eight planets in the solar system, six have been visited or flown by by unmanned spacecraft. The Soviet Union's "Phobos" spacecraft has begun observing the orbit around Mars.

Scientists are also using spacecraft to conduct astronomical observations in all regions of the electromagnetic spectrum above the atmosphere, increasing our understanding of the universe.

In addition to conducting scientific experiments using instruments on satellites, people have established "space stations" in Earth orbit and "space laboratories" on space shuttles to conduct various space science experiments.

Observing the Earth

Currently, polar-orbiting satellites and geostationary satellites complement each other, forming a system for observing the entire Earth.

From photographs of the Earth taken from space and satellite data obtained, we see that our Earth is a unified, interdependent network of biological, geological, and chemical cycles. The oceans, atmosphere, land, and living organisms influence each other in very subtle and complex ways. This has laid a good foundation for a comprehensive examination of the Earth, protecting the ecological balance, and the lives on Earth.

Currently, there are about 1,800 artificial satellites orbiting in space. By function, they are roughly divided into three categories: communications, meteorology, and remote sensing.

Using satellites for communication and television broadcasting has become quite common. Approximately 150 countries use space communications; 54 countries provide communication services to more than 7,500 ships and other marine facilities through eight geostationary satellites. Satellite communications between the ground and aircraft in flight have recently begun, and trials are underway to use satellite communications to contact vehicles in motion.

Some meteorological satellites observe the entire Earth once or twice a day, and the data obtained can be provided free of charge to all countries.

Remote sensing satellites use electromagnetic radiation or microwaves to collect various data about the Earth's biology, land, and oceans from a distance. This can provide a comprehensive understanding of Earth's resources and can distinguish different forest areas, monitor deserts, and locust habitats, among other things, aiding in construction and disaster relief.

The U.S. has launched five Earth observation satellites, which can photograph images of almost any place on Earth every 18 days. To date, more than 2 million images have been taken, which can be provided to various countries through commercial channels.

Developing the Solar System

Humanity is expected to land on Mars in the next century. The U.S. and the Soviet Union plan to conduct detailed explorations of Venus and Mars, the Moon and Jupiter's atmosphere, and the surface of comets in the 1990s, and to study the Saturn system.

The U.S., Canada, Japan, and Western European countries plan to build an "International Space Station" in space orbit in about 10 years, establishing a permanent base for human activities in space with living quarters and scientific laboratories.

Scientists plan to strengthen the space research of life sciences and medicine through space activities.

The U.S. also plans to launch two polar platforms and a series of geostationary satellites in the 1990s to collect a set of coherent global environmental data over 15 years, in order to study global environmental changes caused by the greenhouse effect and ozone layer variations, and to protect the Earth's environment.

The prospects for the peaceful use of space are bright, and a new space age awaits us!

　　开发外空　服务人类
    本报记者  刘开宸
    内容提要：现在，约有１８００颗人造卫星在太空运转，１５０个国家使用空间通讯。能供人居住和作科学实验的“国际外空站”可望在本世纪末建成。和平利用外空前景美好。
    随着航天技术的迅速发展，如何利用空间技术服务于人类，成为世界各国普遍关心的问题。联合国外空委科技小组委员会一个月前就此进行了讨论，并规定１９９２年为“国际空间年”。那么，人类开发空间的现状和前景如何呢？
    振奋人的成果
    数月来，人类在航天事业上取得的成果令人振奋：
    ３月１８日，载有５名宇航员的美国航天飞机“发现”号安全返回。这是继去年９月后“发现”号第二次遨游太空。美国在中断两年半后成功地恢复了航天飞行，表明其航天飞机的质量和安全度明显提高。
    去年１１月１５日，苏联首次发射的大型实用型航天飞机“暴风雪”号无人驾驶，运用全自动控制系统飞行和降落。发射它的“能源”号运载火箭，是世界上功率最大的助推火箭。接着，１２月２２日，苏联两名宇航员在外空逗留３３６天后安全返回。这是史无前例的。它说明人可以在外空长期生活和工作。
    此外，西欧国家成功地发射了阿丽亚娜—４型ＬＰ运载火箭，同时把３颗卫星送入轨道；中国成功地发射了长征—４号运载火箭。这一切都引起了世界航天界的重视。
    探索外空
    空间事业有两大方面：探索外空，以开发外空；观测地球，以保护和利用地球。两者都将造福人类。
    太阳对地球存在和人类生活有直接影响，所以要探索宇宙空间的奥秘，自然应当首先观测太阳和太阳系，并研究太阳系将来是否适合人类生存。苏联去年７月发射了Ｐｈｏｂｏｓ太空船观测太阳。目前，它飞行正常。
    除地球外，在太阳系其余８颗行星中，有６颗已经有无人驾驶的航天器到达过或飞近过。苏联的Ｐｈｏｂｏｓ太空船已开始观测火星周围的轨道。
    科学家们还在大气层之上电磁波谱的所有区域内利用航天器进行天文观测，增加了人们对宇宙的认识。
    除了通过卫星上的仪器进行科学实验外，人们还在地球轨道上空设立“空间站”，在航天飞机上设立“空间实验室”，进行各种太空科学实验。
    观测地球
    现在，地极轨道卫星和地球静止卫星相互补充，已形成了一个观测整个地球的系统。
    从外空拍摄的地球照片和获得的卫星数据看，我们的地球是一个统一的、互相依存的生物、地质、化学循环网络。海洋、大气、大地和生命机体以非常微妙和复杂的方式互相影响。这对于全面考察地球、保护生态平衡和地球上的生命打下了良好的基础。
    现在约有１８００颗人造卫星在太空运转，按功能分，大致有通讯、气象和遥感三类。
    利用卫星进行通讯和电视播转，已相当普遍。约有１５０个国家使用空间通讯；５４个国家通过８颗静止卫星向７５００多艘船舶和其它海上设施提供通讯服务。地面与航行中的飞机进行卫星通讯联系于最近开始，目前正在试验用卫星通讯跟运行中的车辆联络。
    一些气象卫星每天对整个地球进行一次或两次观测，所得数据可免费向各国提供。
    遥感卫星利用电磁辐射或微波从远处搜集地球生物、陆地和海洋的各种资料，据此可以全面了解地球资源，还可以区分不同的森林区、监测沙漠、蝗虫栖息地等等，有助于建设和救灾。
    美国已发射５颗大地遥感卫星，它们每１８天可对地球上几乎任何地方拍摄一次图像。现在共拍摄了２００多万张图像，可以通过商业途径向各国提供。
    开发太阳系
    人类可望在下个世纪登上火星。美国和苏联等国计划在９０年代详细探测金星和火星、月亮和木星大气层以及彗星表面，并研究土星系。
    美国、加拿大、日本和西欧国家计划在１０年后先在外空轨道上建立一个“国际外空站”，在上面建起人的居住区、科学实验室，作为人们在空间活动的一个永久性基地。
    科学家们计划通过空间活动，加强生命科学和医学的空间研究。
    美国还计划在９０年代内发射两个极地平台和一系列地球静止卫星，以收集为期１５年的一套连贯的全球环境数据，以便研究由于温室效应和臭氧层的变化所引起的全球性环境变化，以设法保护地球环境。
    和平利用空间的前景美好，新的空间时代在等待着我们！
