A couple of disabled farmers have raised two college students. This couple is Chen Jinfeng and Shang Liying, who live in Yonghe Village, Huangjian Township, Sheyang County, Jiangsu Province.

Chen Jinfeng, now 62, participated in the Korean War in 1950. During the transportation of ammunition to the front line, he became completely deaf and suffered a concussion after a truck accident, and then returned home. His wife, Shang Liying, is nearly 60 years old. She lost her left eye at the age of 13.

In the spring of 1976, during a difficult time when food was scarce, most families in the village had to take their children out of school. However, the Chen family remained steadfast. They sold their laying hens to gather tuition fees for their two children and also borrowed old books from the scrap collection market of the supply and marketing cooperative to help their children study.

The parents endured hardships, and the sons studied diligently. Both sons received "Three Good Student" awards from primary school to university. After entering university, they continued to wear patched clothes and worked part-time during vacations to earn tuition fees. In 1986, the elder son, Wenpin, obtained a master's degree from Nanjing Agricultural University and recently was admitted to a doctoral program. The younger son, Wenhua, graduated from university and was assigned to work at the Sheyang Cement Factory. He is currently preparing to apply for a master's program.

　　一对残疾夫妇家出两大学生
    本报讯　一对残疾夫妇组成的农民家庭里出了一个大学生、一个博士研究生。这对夫妇叫陈锦峰和商立英，家住江苏省射阳县黄尖镇永和村。
    陈老爹今年６２岁，１９５０年参加抗美援朝，在向前方运送军火的途中因翻车跌成两耳全聋和脑震荡后，退伍回乡。老伴商立英年近６０，１３岁时左眼失明。
    １９７６年春，青黄不接，村里大多数人家的孩子都退了学，陈家却丝毫没动摇。他们将家里正生蛋的母鸡卖了，为两个孩子凑学费；还到供销社废品收购门市部把人家卖掉的旧书借回来，让孩子学习。
    父母含辛茹苦，儿子刻苦攻读。两个儿子，从小学到大学年年都拿到三好生的奖状。考上大学后，依旧穿着补丁衣服，放假做临时工挣学费。１９８６年，大儿子文品在南京农业大学获得了硕士学位，最近又考上博士研究生。小儿子文华大学毕业后，分配在射阳县水泥厂工作，目前正报考硕士研究生。
