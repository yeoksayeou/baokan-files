Xinhua News Agency, Windhoek, April 1st.

As the United Nations Security Council's Resolution 435 on Namibia's independence officially began implementation, armed clashes erupted between Namibian police and unidentified armed individuals in northern Namibia on April 1st.

According to reports, two Namibian police officers and 38 individuals, reportedly from Angola, were killed in the conflict. Additionally, 14 police officers were injured.

South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha, who is currently in Windhoek, accused the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) of crossing the Angola-Namibia border, thereby violating the agreement signed by South Africa, Cuba, and Angola. He demanded that the United Nations representatives investigate the incident and threatened to expel them from Namibia if they did not comply.

As of now, SWAPO has not responded to this incident.

According to reports, the spokesperson for the United Nations Special Representative for Namibia, Martti Ahtisaari, described the incident as a "very serious development." He promised to send a United Nations team to investigate the situation in northern Namibia and report back to Ahtisaari and the commander of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group, Prem Chand.

Xinhua News Agency, United Nations, April 1st.

United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar today expressed serious concern over the armed conflict in northern Namibia. The United Nations has dispatched an investigation team to the region to probe the incident. The conflict occurred as the United Nations forces overseeing Namibia's transition to independence began their duties. Observers here believe that the conflict indicates that Namibia's transition to independence will not be smooth.

　　纳米比亚独立进程伊始  北部地区发生武装冲突
    德奎利亚尔深表关切
    新华社温得和克４月１日电  在安理会关于纳米比亚独立的４３５号决议正式开始实施之时，纳米比亚警察与一些身份不明的武装人员１日在纳米比亚北部发生了武装冲突。
    据报道，在冲突中，２名纳米比亚警察和３８名据说是来自安哥拉的人死亡，另有１４名警察受伤。
    正在温得和克的南非外长皮克·博塔指控西南非洲人民组织越过安、纳边界，从而破坏了南非、古巴和安哥拉签订的协议。他要求联合国代表调查此事，并威胁说，否则要他们撤离纳米比亚。
    到目前为止，西南非洲人民组织尚未对此事件作出反应。
    据报道，联合国负责纳米比亚问题的特别代表马尔蒂·阿赫蒂萨里的发言人认为，这次事件是“非常严重的事态发展”。他答应派遣一个联合国小组去纳米比亚北部进行调查，并向阿赫蒂萨里以及联合国过渡时期援助团司令普雷姆·昌德报告。
    据新华社联合国４月１日电　联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔今天对纳米比亚北部发生的冲突表示严重关切。联合国已派遣调查小组前往该地区调查这一事件。这次冲突事件发生在联合国监督纳米比亚独立进程部队正式开始值勤之际。此间观察家认为，冲突表明纳米比亚向独立过渡的进程将不会顺利。
