A child's heart is pure and honest, as white as snowflakes and as clear as pond water. It is a beautiful memory that forever lingers in our dreams.

People cherish their childhood, cherishing a heart that is without blemish. A child went into a small shop selling goldfish, eagerly selecting the most precious goldfish and the most exquisite fishbowl. From his pocket, he took out a handful of colorful pebbles and placed them in the shopkeeper's hand. The shopkeeper hesitated briefly, then accepted the child's pebbles and said, "You've given too much; I should give you another goldfish." The child left joyfully.

This is a beautiful story. The shopkeeper's generosity protected a heart that was without blemish.

I also have a story, but it's not about buying goldfish. When I was almost ten years old, I was in elementary school, excelling in my studies and serving as both the class monitor and a member of the Young Pioneers' Brigade. One day, the teacher told us that the Cultural Revolution had begun, and the school was establishing a Red Guards organization. The school office issued student IDs, asking each student to fill out their family background. On the first day, I did not go to get my student ID. A classmate went and filled in "capitalist" for the family background, and was scolded by another classmate as a "capitalist's brat." He cried alone. The one who scolded him was a mischievous student with poor academic performance (possibly a child of a cadre).

I went home and asked my parents what our family background was (those were the first two strange words I had ever encountered). My father said, "We are workers" (later I found out that my father had gone south with the army in 1948 and was a cadre, but because he was not a party member, he was called a worker). I said, "The teacher asked about my father's family background." My father, with great difficulty, said two words: "rich peasant." Those two words were like a thunderbolt on a clear day; I felt a sense of fear and unease for the first time.

I waited until the last day to get my student ID. As I walked into the school office, the principal, Mr. Yang Shiying, and the party branch secretary, Mr. Wang, were on duty issuing student IDs. Mr. Yang took out a student ID, asked for my name and age, and filled it out. Then he asked about my family background. My face turned red to my ears, as if I were lying, and I replied, "Worker." Mr. Yang was obviously not satisfied with this answer and said, "This background is too vague; what is your father's family background?"

I lowered my head and, almost through gritted teeth, said two words: "rich peasant." I did not dare to look up again until Mr. Yang had filled out the student ID, stamped it, and handed it to me, saying softly, "It's filled out; here you go." I took the student ID and put it in my pocket, running out of the office in shame.

I ran to the small grove by the school's Star Pavilion, trembling as I took out the newly issued student ID. I opened the cover and found that Mr. Yang had written the neat characters "worker" in the "family background" column.

My heart was suddenly filled with gratitude and relief. I remember crying then, crying with joy...

Later, as I grew up and experienced more, I could not escape the shadow of those two words, "rich peasant." In those days, joining the Communist Youth League required a background check, so did entering high school. After going to the countryside, the background became the foundation of one's fate. Whether it was joining the army, being recruited for work, or being recommended for university, almost everything put the background in the first place. As for joining the Communist Party, there was no need to say more. I remember that in 1977 when I took the college entrance exam and in 1982 when I went abroad, my family and I were always most anxious about the "political review."

More than 20 years have passed (I was not yet ten years old then), and Mr. Yang has also passed away from liver cancer during the ten years of turmoil. He was an independent democratic person, and the people in the county still remember him as a good person.

I miss him very much, especially this small childhood story.

　　童年故事
　　李晓林
    童心是纯真的，诚实的，像雪花一样洁白，像池水一样清澈见底，它是一种美好的回忆，永远留在梦中。
    人们珍爱自己的童年，珍爱的，原是一颗无瑕的童心。一个孩子到一个卖金鱼的小店里，兴致勃勃地挑出最名贵的金鱼和最精致的鱼缸，从口袋里掏出一把五颜六色的小石头，放到老板的手上，老板短暂地犹豫了一下，收下孩子的石子，说：你给的太多了，我应该再给你一条金鱼。孩子兴高采烈地走了。
    这是一个美丽的故事。金鱼店老板的慷慨，保护了一颗无瑕的童心。
    我也有一个故事，却不是买金鱼。我快十岁那年，上小学的时候，在班上学习成绩优秀，又是班主席和少先队大队委。有一天，老师告诉我们，文化大革命了，学校要成立红小兵组织，传达室发学生证，让每个同学回家填写家庭成份，第一天我没有去领学生证，有一个同学去领了，家庭出身一栏填写的是“资本家”，被班上另一个同学骂了“资本家的小崽子”，他偷偷地一个人哭了。骂人的是一个调皮、学习成绩也不好的孩子（可能是干部子弟）。
    我回到家里，问爸爸妈妈，家里是什么成份（那是我一生中第一次接触这两个陌生的字眼）？爸爸说：是职工（后来知道，父亲１９４８年随军南下，是干部，但因为不是党员，所以称职工）。我说：老师问父亲的家庭出身。父亲极艰难地说出了“富农”两个字。这两个字像晴天霹雳，我第一次感到一种可怕和不安。
    我一直等到最后一天才去领学生证。走进传达室，这天值班发学生证的是校长杨世英先生和党支部书记王老师。杨校长拿出一张学生证，问了姓名和年龄，填写着，又问到家庭出身，我的脸一下红到了耳根，似乎觉得自己在撒谎，回答道：“职工。”杨校长显然不满意这样的回答，说，“这个成份太糊涂，你父亲的家庭成份是什么？”
    我低着头，几乎是从牙缝里说出了两个字：富农。我再也没有敢抬起头来，直到杨校长填好了学生证，盖好章，塞到我的手里，轻轻地说了声：“填好了，给你吧。”我接过学生证放进口袋，羞愧地跑出了传达室。
    我带着怨恨、失望和害怕跑到学校魁星亭旁的小树丛里，颤抖地掏出新发的学生证，打开封面，却发现杨校长清秀的“职工”二字工整地躺在“家庭出身”一栏里。
    我心里顿时有一种说不出的感激和庆幸，记得当时我哭了，高兴地哭了……
    后来我长大了，经历的也多了，我终于没有能逃出那“富农”二字的阴影。那年月，入团要成份，升高中要成份，下农村后，成份更成了命运的奠基石，当兵，招工，推荐上大学几乎无一不是把成份放在第一位，至于入共产党，就更不用说了。记得１９７７年考大学和１９８２年出国，家里和自己无不是把“政审”当作最提心吊胆的一关。
    一晃２０多年过去了（当年我还不到十岁），杨校长也在十年动乱中因肝癌去世了，他是一位无党派民主人士，县里的人都还记得他是一个好人。
    我很怀念他，特别怀念这小小的童年故事。
