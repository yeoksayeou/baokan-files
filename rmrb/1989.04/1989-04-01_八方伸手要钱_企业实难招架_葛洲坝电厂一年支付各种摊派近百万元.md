In 1988, Gezhouba Power Plant paid nearly one million yuan in various assessments. Among these, 280,000 yuan was used to support middle school students' tuition fees, 200,000 yuan was paid to the Yichang Municipal Education Commission for the repair of dilapidated buildings, 79,000 yuan was paid to the local People's Armed Police detachment for vehicles, over 110,000 yuan was contributed to various academic societies, and several hundred thousand yuan was used to support various competitions. Some news organizations in Yichang also took the opportunity to seek "support" from Gezhouba Power Plant. In 1985, Yichang Television Station borrowed 500,000 yuan from Gezhouba Power Plant, promising to repay it within three years. However, when Gezhouba Power Plant requested repayment last year, the borrower claimed, "We are unable to repay; please consider this as support." The plant director had no choice but to agree. The Yichang Radio Station's "Voice of Enterprises" program also requested 8,000 yuan in support from this plant.

This is only a partial account of the assessments paid by Gezhouba Power Plant. Similar phenomena are also very serious in other parts of Hubei Province.

　　八方伸手要钱　企业实难招架
    葛洲坝电厂一年支付各种摊派近百万元
    １９８８年葛洲坝电厂支付各种摊派款近百万元。其中资助中学生学费２８万元，支付宜昌市教委危楼修建款２０万元，支付驻葛洲坝武警部队汽车款７．９万元，各种学会资助款１１万多元，各类竞赛资助款数万元，等等。宜昌市一些新闻单位也借机向葛洲坝电厂寻求“资助”。１９８５年，宜昌市电视台向葛洲坝电厂借款５万元，申明３年内归还。可是，去年葛洲坝电厂要求宜昌电视台还款时，借方却称“无力偿还，请予资助。”厂长只好同意了。宜昌市广播电台举办“企业之声”节目，也要求这家电厂资助８０００元。
    这仅仅是葛洲坝电厂支付摊派的部分情况，这种现象在湖北其它地区也十分严重。
