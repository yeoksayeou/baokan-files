Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, April 23rd.

Sri Lankan President Premadasa once again called for national peace and unity to prevent foreign intervention in Sri Lanka's internal affairs.

Premadasa made this appeal at a meeting of the Central Executive Committee of the ruling United National Party. He pointed out: "If the various parties cannot unite now, external forces will intervene, which will pose a threat to our sovereignty and independence. We do not want any external forces to interfere in our internal affairs. We can solve our own problems through consultation, reaching a consensus, and achieving reconciliation."

Premadasa reiterated that he is ready to meet with representatives of anti-government organizations such as the Tamil Eelam Liberation Tigers and the People's Liberation Front at any time to discuss their grievances with the government.

According to reports, the Tigers organization has accepted the president's request and selected negotiation representatives. It is expected that talks between the two sides will take place in the near future. The People's Liberation Front, however, has not responded positively.

　　斯总统呼吁全国团结  以防止外国干涉内政
    新华社科伦坡４月２３日电  斯里兰卡总统普雷马达萨４月２２日再次呼吁全国实现和平与团结，以防外国干涉斯里兰卡内政。
    普雷马达萨在执政的统一国民党中央执行委员会会议上发出了这一呼吁。他指出：“如果各政党现在不能团结一致，外部力量就会来干涉，那将会对我们的主权和独立构成威胁。我们不希望任何外部力量来干涉我们的内政。我们能够通过协商，统一意见，达成和解来解决我们自己的问题。”
    普雷马达萨重申，他随时准备在任何地方会见泰米尔伊拉姆猛虎解放组织和人民解放阵线等反政府组织的代表，来讨论他们对政府不满的方面。
    据报道，猛虎组织已接受总统的要求，并选出谈判代表。预计双方的谈判将在近日内举行。人民解放阵线则未予积极响应。
