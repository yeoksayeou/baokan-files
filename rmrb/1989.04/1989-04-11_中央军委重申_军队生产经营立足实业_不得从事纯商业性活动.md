The Central Military Commission has reiterated that military production and operations should focus on real industries, primarily engaging in agriculture, animal husbandry, mining, technology development, and services, and should not engage in purely commercial activities.

The Central Military Commission recently approved and forwarded the General Logistics Department's "Overall Plan for Reforming Military Production and Operations." The document states that during the primary stage of socialism and in a period of peace when the country concentrates its efforts on economic construction, it is in line with China's national conditions, military situation, and is beneficial to the country, the people, and the military to engage in appropriate-scale production and operations. This is a long-term policy and task. Especially in the current situation where military funding is tight, it is even more important to improve production and operations and implement the "standard plus subsidy" approach. The document emphasizes that production and operations should start from the military's fundamental functions, better guarantee combat readiness and training tasks, and achieve a unity of economic and military benefits, promoting the improvement of the army's combat effectiveness.

The document forwarded by the Central Military Commission strictly regulates the scope of operations at various levels: factories, stud farms, and other units managed by the headquarters, military regions, and military branches should actively develop civilian and export products while ensuring the completion of mandatory military product production tasks; military-run factories, mines, service industries, and other military enterprises should develop marketable products based on market and social needs; warehouses, hospitals, technical colleges, scientific research, repair, and engineering institutions should, while ensuring the completion of internal military tasks, play multiple roles and provide paid services to society; agricultural and sideline production should mainly supplement the troops' lives in kind.

The document forwarded by the Central Military Commission requires the separation of military and enterprise management, with enterprise cadres gradually not occupying military quotas, not consuming military funds, and not wearing military uniforms. It also stipulates that various levels of departments, political, and educational institutions are not allowed to directly run enterprises. The income from production should be managed uniformly through financial channels, mainly used to guarantee the troops' lives, make up for the shortage of normal funds, and expand reproduction, and it is not allowed to misuse the funds.

The document forwarded by the Central Military Commission emphasizes that the military's production and operations must model the execution of national policies and laws, operate according to regulations, engage in lawful operations, and maintain integrity.

　　中央军委重申
　　军队生产经营立足实业
　　不得从事纯商业性活动
    新华社北京４月１０日电　中央军委重申，军队生产经营要立足于搞实业，主要从事种植业、养殖业、工矿业、技术开发和服务业等，不得从事纯商业性活动。
    中央军委最近批转的总后勤部《关于改革军队生产经营的总体方案》指出，在社会主义初级阶段，在国家集中力量进行经济建设的和平时期，军队坚持搞好适度规模的生产经营，符合我国的国情、军情、利国、利民、利军，是一项长期的方针和任务。特别是在当前军费紧缺的情况下，更应搞好生产经营，实行“标准加补助”。文件强调，要从军队的根本职能出发，使生产经营更好地保障战备、训练等任务的完成，做到经济效益和军事效益的统一，促进部队战斗力的提高。
    中央军委批转的文件对各级经营范围作了严格规定：总部、军区、军兵种领导管理的企业化工厂、马场等单位，要在确保完成指令性军品生产任务的前提下，积极发展民品和外贸产品；部队自办的厂矿、服务行业等军办企业，要根据市场和社会需要，发展适销对路的产品；仓库、医院、技术院校，科研、修理、工程等事业单位，要在确保完成军内任务的前提下，发挥多种功能，为社会提供有偿服务；农副业生产主要从实物上补助部队生活。
    中央军委批转的文件要求，实行军企分开，企业干部逐步做到不占军队编制定额，不吃军费，不穿军衣，并规定各级司、政、学机关不准直接办企业。生产收益要纳入财务渠道统一管理，主要用于保证部队生活，弥补正常经费不足，扩大再生产，不准乱支滥用。
    中央军委批转的文件强调，军队开展生产经营，一定要模范执行国家政策法令，照章办事，依法经营，保持廉洁。
