Enterprises Come Knocking, Commerce and Trade Should Be Enthusiastic

    Li Lanqing Requires More Service for "Three-R" Enterprises

    Beijing, April 24 (Xinhua) -- "Serving and managing 'three-R' enterprises is an important responsibility of the commerce and trade departments," said Li Lanqing, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Commerce and Trade, at the closing ceremony of the National Foreign Investment Work Conference today. "When enterprises come knocking and seek to resolve issues related to foreign investment, the commerce and trade departments should adopt an active and enthusiastic attitude. For issues that can be resolved, every effort should be made to resolve them. For issues that cannot be resolved, efforts should be made to contact relevant units to help clear the way for resolution. At the same time, attention should be paid to leveraging the role of foreign investment enterprise associations."

    Over the past two years, many places have experimented with various models for serving and managing "three-R" enterprises, exploring some effective methods. Li Lanqing believes that regardless of the model, as long as it is beneficial for macro-management, convenient for investors, and improves work efficiency, it is a good model. There is no need to insist on uniformity, nor is there a need for top-down alignment. Each locality should manage according to its own actual situation. The division of labor among local departments may vary greatly, but as the contract approval unit, the commerce and trade departments, which are responsible for fulfilling contracts externally and coordinating, have the responsibility to help enterprises fulfill contracts smoothly and actively serve enterprises.

    Li Lanqing said, "Improving the investment environment is not as important or effective as managing the existing foreign-invested enterprises well. Currently, there are approximately 10,000 foreign-invested enterprises that have opened or are under construction nationwide. The number is large, and it is not easy to solve problems collectively. However, when distributed to a province, city, or county, except for a few coastal areas, it is only a few hundred, a few dozen, or even a few enterprises. Taking care of them and providing some protection is not impossible. In this way, your region will be more attractive."

　　企业找上门  经贸要热情    
    李岚清要求多为“三资”企业服务
    本报北京４月２４日讯  记者计泓赓、冯霄报道：“为‘三资’企业服务和加强管理，是经贸部门的重要职责。”经贸部副部长李岚清在今天闭幕的全国外商投资工作会议上强调：“企业找上门，要求解决与外商投资有关的问题，经贸部门都要采取积极热情的态度，能帮助解决的，尽力解决，解决不了的，也应积极联系有关单位，帮助疏通解决。同时也要注意发挥外商投资企业协会的作用。”
    近两年来，不少地方尝试了各种为“三资”企业服务和管理模式，摸索了一些做法。李岚清认为，不管是哪种模式，只要既能有利于宏观管理，又能方便投资者和提高工作效率，就是好模式，不必强求一律，更不必上下对口。各地方怎么管，由地方根据自己的实际情况自己来定。各地部门之间的分工可能千差万别，但作为合同审批单位，对外履行合同的归口管理和协调单位的经贸部门，有责任帮助企业顺利履行合同，积极为企业服务。
    李岚清说，完善投资环境，没有比办好现有外商投资企业更重要、更有效的了。现在全国开业和在建的外商投资企业约１万家，数字很大，集中解决问题很不容易，但分散到一个省、地、市、县，除个别沿海地区外，也仅是几百家、几十家，甚至几家，照顾一下，保一保，不是不可能做到的。这样，你这个地区就会更有吸引力。
