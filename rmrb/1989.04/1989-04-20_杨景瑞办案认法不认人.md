A manager of a collective factory in Daqing was investigated for selling waste oil. He tried to bribe the investigating officer, Yang Jingrui, with 1.5 million yuan. However, Yang Jingrui refused the bribe and sternly said, "Take your money back. Don't soil my uniform!"

Yang Jingrui is the director of the Daqing Oilfield Security Office. This veteran police officer has been in his position since September 1986. In just over two years, he has refused bribes totaling 2.75 million yuan. Although he did not become a "millionaire," he has been recognized as an outstanding worker and has been awarded a third-class merit citation.

The Daqing Oilfield is very valuable. Some people always try to take a bite out of this "fat piece of meat." Thus, there are those who steal materials and those who sell oilfield products illegally. Yang Jingrui leads a team of more than ten officers to combat economic crimes such as theft, protecting the oilfield.

Last May, a village-run asphalt factory in Daqing sold over a thousand tons of waste oil illegally. After the case was discovered, Yang Jingrui arrested the two leaders of the factory. "As soon as the case came in, the backdoor lobbying began." Relatives, fellow soldiers, friends, and even those carrying thick wads of money came to plead for leniency. Yang Jingrui responded, "If you're thirsty, I'll boil some water; if you're hungry, I'll cook some food. If you want to talk about the case, then you might as well keep your mouth shut!" In this way, he turned away wave after wave of petitioners, ultimately uncovering six criminals from this case and recovering over 100,000 yuan for the state.

A farmer who illegally purchased waste oil turned himself in, and Yang Jingrui decided to handle the case leniently according to the law. The farmer was grateful and, nearing the New Year, came to Yang Jingrui's home one evening, offering 3,000 yuan. Yang Jingrui refused to accept it, and the farmer knelt down, refusing to leave. Yang Jingrui persuaded him for a long time before finally convincing him to go back.

Yang Jingrui protects the oilfield and also has to guard against attempts to corrupt him. A small refinery wanted to find a patron and actively sought to partner with the Oilfield Security Office. The representative told Yang Jingrui, "You don't need to contribute anything. At the end of the year, each of your subordinates will get 1,000 yuan, and you will get 100,000 yuan." As a result, the representative not only failed to establish the partnership but also received a stern rebuke from Yang Jingrui.

Money cannot sway Yang Jingrui, so some people use their tongues to slander him. They say he is "unfriendly" and "unapproachable," and even sent him threatening letters, vowing to make him "stand at attention." No matter what tactics they use, Yang Jingrui always says, "I will uphold the law and fear nothing!"

Yang Jingrui strictly demands of himself and his subordinates. In over two years, he and his colleagues have handled more than 120 economic cases, apprehended over 250 criminals, and recovered 1.82 million yuan in fines and confiscated property for the state.

During this period, they refused 300 invitations to dine, averaging one refusal every three days; they rejected over 1,000 pleas for leniency and refused 44,000 yuan in bribes.

Yang Jingrui is also known as a good officer who does not handle cases involving money, personal connections, or privileges.

　　杨景瑞办案认法不认人
    张福宽　张联生
    大庆市一个集体厂的“头儿”，因倒卖渣油被立了案，他托人“甩”给办案人杨景瑞１．５万元。没想到，这一手不但没“捅”开法网，反而激起了杨景瑞的倔脾气，他骂道：“把钱给我收回去，别脏了我的警服！”
    杨景瑞，大庆市保卫油田办公室主任。这位公安战线上的老干警，自从１９８６年９月接任这个被人称为“肥差”的岗位后，两年多点的时间里，光拒贿的钱就达２．７５万元。他没当上“万元户”，却连年当上了先进工作者，还立了三等功。
    大庆油田很“肥”。有人总想在这块肥肉上叨一口。于是，有偷窃物资的，有倒卖油田产品的。杨景瑞领着１０多名干警，打击偷窃等经济犯罪，保卫着油田。
    去年５月，大庆有一个村办沥青厂倒卖渣油上千吨。案发后，杨景瑞把这个厂的两个“头头”都给逮了起来。“案子刚进门，后门就托人”。前来说情的，有老乡，有战友，有朋友，有人还腰里别着大把的钱。对上门说情的，杨景瑞说：“渴了，我去烧水；饿了，我去做饭。要谈案子，那就免开尊口！”就这样，他挡住了一批批说情人，结果从这个案子中挖出６名犯罪分子，为国家收回１０万多元的资金。
    一个非法收购渣油的农民，因能主动投案，杨景瑞决定依法从宽处理。对方感激不尽，快过年了，一天晚上他到杨景瑞家，递上３０００元钱。杨景瑞拒收，他跪地不起，杨景瑞跟他磨了好一阵子嘴皮子，才算把他劝回去了。
    杨景瑞保卫着油田，还得拿出一定的精力“保卫”自己。有个小炼油厂，想找靠山，主动找上门来要与油田保卫办公室联营。来人对杨景瑞说：“你们啥也不用出。年末，你手下每人１０００元，给你１万元。”结果，来人不但没“联上”，还挨了杨景瑞一顿克。
    金钱买不动杨景瑞，有人就用舌头猛劲埋汰他。什么“不讲交情，不近人情”等等，甚至有人还给他写恐吓信，声言要让他“立正”。不管用什么招式，杨景瑞总是说：“依法办案，我啥也不怕！”
    杨景瑞严格要求自己和他的部下。两年多来，他和他的同事们共办各种经济案件１２０多起，抓获犯罪分子２５０多名，为国家收缴罚没款１８２万元。
    这期间，他们拒吃请３００多人次，平均每３天就一次；拒说情上千人次，拒收贿赂４．４万多元。
    杨景瑞也被人称为不办金钱案、人情案、特权案的好干警。
