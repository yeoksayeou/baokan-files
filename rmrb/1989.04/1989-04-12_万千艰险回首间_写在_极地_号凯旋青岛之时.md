On April 10th, the "Jidip" distant ocean scientific expedition ship, bearing 115 expedition members who had endured countless hardships, slowly docked at the Qingdao port. The ship, covered in scars and rust, had completed a journey of 142 days and 33,000 kilometers, reaching as far south as 69°22′34″. It had spent 29 days in the ice zone, unloaded 2,300 tons of supplies, and established the 1,654 square meter Chinese Antarctic Zhongshan Station. How could outsiders understand the hardships hidden behind these seemingly dry statistics and the proud achievements recorded within them?

"Now, all of this can be told," said the expedition's chief commander, Chen Dehong.

The "Jidip" set sail from Qingdao on November 20th of the previous year, heading south. On December 18th, it entered the Antarctic ice sea, navigating through densely packed floating ice. Three days later, the thick steel plate on the left side of the bow of this 15,000-ton icebreaker was pierced by a hole over a foot in diameter by the solid ice. Thanks to the protection of the sealed compartments, the expedition ship continued to force its way through the ice fields, finding a path to the Antarctic Prydz Bay.

On December 23rd, the "Jidip" reached a point just 20 kilometers from the Antarctic continent, blocked by ice shelves several meters thick. The ship attempted to find a way through the ice, entering and exiting the ice sea multiple times in search of a fissure. Helicopters scouted the path, and crew members manually broke the ice with large hammers, using explosives and steel drills. For 22 days, all efforts seemed futile.

When the expedition ship finally managed to find a route and reached a point near the Soviet Progress Station, the true face of the Antarctic revealed itself. Starting on January 14th, the massive ice sheets surrounding the area experienced a series of unprecedented ice collapses in the history of Antarctic exploration. The terrifying sound of ice breaking echoed across the white night sky of Prydz Bay, and ice mountains rolled and crashed, filling a five-square-kilometer area. The "Jidip" was in imminent danger of being destroyed.

In this life-or-death situation, all crew members took their positions, forming emergency rescue and ice observation teams. Some expedition members moved valuable instruments to the upper decks, others sealed important documents in waterproof bags, and still others risked their lives to capture footage of the ice collapse.

At the same time, a top-secret urgent telegram was sent to the State Antarctic Expedition Committee and the State Council in Beijing. The "Jidip" began evacuating personnel. Twenty-two members, tears in their eyes, climbed down the ropes, carrying the most essential supplies for building the station, and stepped onto the floating ice to reach the shore.

Fortunately, on January 21st, the "Jidip" managed to escape the encirclement of two drifting ice mountains under the guidance of a helicopter.

The expedition team then focused on scientific operations, working day and night to unload cargo and build the station. Thanks to thorough preparations and advanced construction techniques, a Chinese Antarctic Zhongshan Scientific Expedition Station named after Mr. Sun Yat-sen was completed in just 36 days, standing proudly on the Larsemann Hills.

The determination and indomitable spirit of the Chinese people to rise and strive were once again demonstrated in this land of challenges and risks at the end of the earth.

　　万千艰险回首间
　　——写在“极地”号凯旋青岛之时
　　本报记者　杨良化
    4月10日，带着满身伤痕和斑斑锈蚀，“极地”号远洋科学考察船载着115名历尽艰险的考察队员缓缓靠上青岛港码头。
    142天，33000公里，远抵南纬69°22′34″，冰区停留29天，卸运物资2300吨，建起1654平方米的中国南极中山站……局外人怎能知道，在这一系列看似枯燥的数字背后，隐藏着什么样的艰辛，记载着多么值得骄傲的业绩？！
      “现在，这一切都可以说了。”考察总指挥陈德鸿如此说。
      “极地”号自去年11月20日从青岛启航，一路南下，12月18日驶入南极冰海，在密布连营的浮冰群里左突右冲。3天后，这艘15000吨级的抗冰船船首左舷厚厚的钢板即被坚冰撞开了一个直径逾尺的洞。靠着密封舱的保护，考察船继续在冰山群中挤开一条缝，迂回驶向南极普里兹湾。
    12月23日，“极地”号到达距南极大陆仅20公里的海域，被厚达数米的陆缘冰阻碍。船在冰海中几进几出，试图搜寻裂隙“钻空子”。直升机巡回引路，大铁锤人工破冰，点炸药、打钢钎……22天里，就是无可奈何。
    当考察船终于绕道驶抵离苏联进步考察站不远的岸旁时，南极真正露出了狰狞面目。今年1月14日起，周围巨大的冰盖连续发生世界南极考察史上罕见的大冰崩。恐怖的冰盖断裂声，响彻普里兹湾白夜的上空，泥石流般的冰山翻滚着横冲直撞，布满了前后左右五平方公里的海域。“极地”号随时可能船毁人亡。
    生死关头，全船人员各就各位，抢险救生组、冰情观察组自动组成。考察队员有的把贵重仪器搬往上层船舱，有的将公文要件装进密封包里，有的则不顾危险抢拍冰崩资料镜头。
    就在一封注明
  “绝密、特急”的电报发往北京国家南极考察委员会和国务院的同时，“极地”号开始了人员转移疏散工作。22名队员含泪爬下软梯，携带着建站最需要的物资，踩着连成片的浮冰徒步登岸……
    天公开眼，直到1月21日，“极地”号才在直升机的引导下，从两座漂流的冰山间挤出重围。
    考察队抓紧后半段时间科学作业，日夜卸货、建站。由于准备工作充分，施工技术先进，仅用36天，一座以孙中山先生名字命名的中国南极中山科学考察站，就卓然矗立于拉斯曼丘陵。
    中华民族发奋崛起的决心和顽强拚搏的精神，再一次在遍布困难和风险的地球之端，得到了集中的体现。
