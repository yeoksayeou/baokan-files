Xinhua News Agency, Windhoek, April 14th.

The office of the South African Administrator in Namibia and the office of the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General issued a joint statement on April 14th, announcing the extension of the deadline for SWAPO (South West Africa People's Organization) fighters to withdraw from Namibia to April 21st, from the original date of April 15th.

According to an agreement signed by Angola, Cuba, and South Africa, SWAPO fighters who crossed the border into Namibia from Angola on April 1st must report to collection points set up by the UN Assistance Mission by a specified date, and then be escorted back to Angola by the mission.

However, by April 13th, only five SWAPO fighters, including two wounded, had reported to the collection points. Reports indicated that approximately 350 SWAPO fighters had already returned to Angola without going through the collection points.

According to the Namibian police, SWAPO guerrillas engaged in firefights with Namibian security forces on April 11th and 13th in northern Namibia, resulting in the deaths of five SWAPO fighters.

    据纳米比亚警方说，人组游击队同纳米比亚治安部队４月１１日和１３日又在纳米比亚北部交火，有５名人组战士被打死。

    除此之外，其他居住在纳的南非人将失去南非国籍。
