In economic rectification, the focus is on curbing excessive demand and increasing effective supply. The contract system plays a crucial role in both aspects. This is not only because a refined contract system can establish an initial self-discipline mechanism for enterprises, thereby effectively curbing demand inflation, but more importantly, it can enhance enterprise vitality through refinement and development, thereby increasing effective supply.

Currently, the main reasons for economic issues such as inflation, price increases, and disorderly circulation are that after the state implemented the power-decentralization and profit-sharing reforms, enterprises failed to establish a corresponding self-discipline mechanism. This led to blind borrowing, competing investments, and project launches, exacerbating investment inflation. Additionally, uncontrolled distribution and excessive bonuses and rewards have caused workers' income growth to outpace labor productivity, further inflating consumption demand. Therefore, during economic rectification, it is essential to focus on deepening enterprise reforms. By refining and developing the contract system, we can initially establish a self-discipline mechanism for enterprise investments, curbing investment inflation caused by blindly expanding production. We can also establish a distribution mechanism with some self-discipline, curbing the inflation of consumption demand caused by the indiscriminate issuance of bonuses and goods. To achieve this, from the enterprise perspective, several issues need urgent research and resolution.

First, we should quickly implement post-tax contracting, post-tax repayment, and profit-sharing.

Currently, most enterprises practice pre-tax contracting, where enterprises commit to the state the corporate income tax and the adjustment tax determined by the finance department as the main indicators, and enterprises conduct technical transformation with pre-tax repayment. This contracting system not only fails to curb but even stimulates investment demand inflation to some extent. Pre-tax repayment essentially converts the profits that enterprises should remit into interest. This risk-free, quasi-free investment mechanism for enterprises often triggers the impulse for enterprise investment expansion. Moreover, the current policy stipulates that enterprises' self-owned funds in monetary form belong to the enterprise, but once converted into fixed assets, they belong to the state. This ownership relationship further prompts enterprises to prefer distributing self-owned funds as bonuses rather than expanding reproduction, ultimately stimulating consumption demand inflation.

An effective solution is to change from pre-tax contracting to post-tax contracting, implement profit-sharing, reduce the current 55% corporate income tax rate, change the adjustment tax to remitted profits, and use it as the main indicator for enterprises to commit to the state. Simultaneously, change from pre-tax repayment to post-tax repayment, transfer the enterprise's investment subject, enhance the enterprise's sense of responsibility for its investment behavior, and gradually establish and strengthen the enterprise's self-discipline mechanism. This ensures the stable growth of state fiscal revenue while curbing the overall scale of social investment.

Second, we should transition from sole manager (director) contracting to a combination of contractor and group guarantee.

Currently, in many contracted enterprises, there is still the issue of only being responsible for profits and not losses. Apart from external environmental factors, the main reason is the lack of a self-discipline mechanism within the enterprise for bearing profits and losses. Although the contract signed between the manager (director) and the higher authorities is serious, it is only between the manager (director) or a few individuals and the higher authorities. The workers, as the main body of enterprise production and operation, not only lack a sense of pressure and risk but may also have a sense of employment and opposition.

Therefore, within the enterprise, promoting full-employee risk mortgage, and transitioning from sole manager (director) contracting to a combination of contractor and worker group guarantee is a relatively effective way to resolve this contradiction. Workers contribute a certain amount of risk funds as a guarantee, linking the common interests of managers and producers with the enterprise's prosperity and decline through economic means. Risk, pressure, interest, and motivation are combined, fully mobilizing the workers' enthusiasm, and effectively implementing the enterprise's self-discipline mechanism for bearing profits and losses. Additionally, the state's tight monetary policy inevitably creates new contradictions of capital shortage for enterprises. Workers contributing risk guarantee funds for contracting can, to some extent, alleviate the enterprise's temporary capital difficulties and convert some consumption funds into production development funds, reducing market pressure. At the same time, the combination of contractor and worker group guarantee essentially establishes the enterprise's community of interests. This not only enhances enterprise vitality and increases effective social supply but also strengthens the enterprise's ability to resist various external interferences such as intermediary exploitation and levies, which is beneficial for the progress of economic rectification.

Third, we should gradually clarify property rights based on the refinement of the contract system.

Practice over the past few years has shown that the overall effect of the contract system is good, but it is also undeniable that it has certain limitations. It has basically solved the problem of enterprise operational rights but cannot solve the problem of enterprise property rights. Precisely because property rights are unclear, base contracting cannot achieve asset-based self-discipline for bearing profits and losses, nor can it ensure effective self-discipline of the enterprise, resulting in uneven enterprise gains and losses, unfair distribution, short-term production and operation behavior, and investment inflation. Therefore, based on the refinement of the contract system, we should gradually clarify property rights. Enterprises with conditions can trial stockholding systems, making enterprises truly independent commodity producers and operators who are self-managing, self-disciplining, self-developing, and self-reforming.

　　在治理整顿中完善和发展承包制
　　张大印
    治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序，一靠抑制过分膨胀的需求，二靠增加社会的有效供给。承包制对于这两个方面的实现都有重要的作用。这不仅在于通过完善承包制可以建立起初步的企业自我约束机制，从而有效地抑制需求膨胀，更重要的是，通过完善和发展承包制可以进一步增强企业活力，从而实现增加有效供给。
    当前经济生活中出现通货膨胀、物价上涨、流通秩序混乱等现象的一个主要的原因，是国家实行放权让利改革以后，企业没有建立起相应的自我约束机制，以致于盲目抢贷款、争投资、上项目，加剧了投资膨胀；分配失控，工资奖金发放过多，职工收入的增长速度高于劳动生产率的增长速度，加剧了消费需求的膨胀。因此，在治理整顿中，应该紧紧抓住深化企业改革这一关键环节，通过完善和发展承包制，初步建立起企业投资的自我约束机制，抑制盲目扩大生产而导致的投资膨胀；初步建立起具有一定自我约束力的分配机制，抑制乱发奖金实物而产生的消费需求的膨胀。要做到这一点，从企业的角度看，目前有几个问题亟需研究解决。
    一是应尽快实行税后承包，税后还贷，税利分流。
    现在，绝大多数企业实行的是税前承包，即企业将第二步利改税所规定的所得税和财政部门核定的调节税作为主要指标向国家承包，同时，企业进行技术改造实行税前还贷。这种承包体制不仅不利于抑制甚至在一定意义上还刺激了投资需求的膨胀。税前还贷实际上是将企业应上缴的利润转化为利息。这种企业不担风险、变相无偿占用的投资机制，往往诱发企业投资的扩张冲动。况且现行政策规定企业的自有资金作为货币形态为企业所有，而一旦转化为固定资产就为国家所有，这种占有关系又促使企业宁可把自有资金作为奖金分配掉，也不肯扩大再生产，结果刺激了消费需求的膨胀。
    解决这一问题的有效办法是改税前承包为税后承包，实行税利分流，降低现行的５５％的所得税率，改调节税为上缴利润，并作为企业向国家承包的主要指标；同时，改税前还贷为税后还贷，转移企业的投资主体，增强企业对自己投资行为的责任心，逐步建立并强化企业的自我约束机制，在搞活企业的前提下，保证国家财政收入的稳定增长，从这个方面抑制社会投资总规模的膨胀。
    二是变单纯的厂长（经理）一人承包为承包人与群体担保相结合。
    如今，在不少承包企业还存有只负盈不负亏的问题，这除了外部环境方面的原因外，主要的还是企业内部缺乏自负盈亏、自我约束的机制。厂长（经理）对国家承包的合同虽然严肃，但只是厂长（经理）一人或少数几个人与上级签定的，而作为企业生产经营主体的职工不仅没有压力感和风险感，甚至还有雇佣心理和对立情绪。
    因此，在企业内部推行全员风险抵押，变厂长（经理）一人承包为承包人与职工群体担保相结合是解决这一矛盾的比较有效的途径。职工交纳一定的风险基金作担保，把经营者和生产者的共同利益与企业兴衰通过经济手段紧密地联系起来。风险、压力、利益、动力相互结合，职工的积极性能得以充分调动，企业自负盈亏，自我约束机制也能得以有效的实施。另外，国家实行紧缩银根的措施难免使企业出现资金紧缺的新矛盾。职工交纳承包的风险担保基金，不仅可以从一定程度上缓解企业暂时的资金困难，而且还可以把一部分消费基金转化为生产发展基金，减轻对市场的压力。同时，承包人与职工群体担保相结合，实际上也确立起了企业的利益共同体。这不仅能增强企业活力，增加社会的有效供给，而且能增强企业抵制诸如中间盘剥、摊派等各种外来干扰的能力，有利于治理整顿的进行。
    三是在完善承包制的基础上逐步明确产权关系。
    几年来的实践说明，承包制总的效应是好的，但也不可否认，它也还有一定的局限性。它虽然基本上解决了企业的经营权的问题，但还不能解决企业的产权问题。正是由于产权关系不明确，使得基数承包不能实现资产上的自负盈亏，也难以保证企业确有成效的自我约束，以致造成企业苦乐不均，分配不公，生产经营的短期行为，投资膨胀等。因此，应在完善承包制的基础上，逐步明确产权关系，有条件的可以试行股份制，使企业真正成为自主经营、自负盈亏、自我约束、自我发展、自我改造的独立的商品生产者和经营者。
