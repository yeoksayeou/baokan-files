The latest sampling survey by the National Bureau of Statistics indicates that despite natural disasters and price increases in production materials in some regions, farmers' income in China still grew last year. Non-agricultural industry income grew faster, increasing its share, but price increases resulted in more losses than gains for farmers.

According to the survey, the per capita net income of farmers last year was 545 yuan, an increase of 82 yuan, or 17.8% compared to the previous year. After accounting for price increases, farmers' actual income grew by 6.3% compared to the previous year.

Last year, the state raised the procurement prices for agricultural products, but the growth rate of agricultural income was still slower than that of non-agricultural income. In the per capita net income of farmers, the pure income from the primary, secondary, and tertiary industries was 493 yuan, an increase of 18.1% compared to the previous year. Among this, the pure income from the primary industry increased by 14.8% compared to the previous year, and its share of the income from the three industries decreased from 72.1% the previous year to 70.1%. The pure income from the secondary and tertiary industries increased by 26.6% compared to the previous year, and their share increased from 37.9% the previous year to 39.9%.

Another notable feature of the changes in farmers' income last year was the simultaneous growth of household operational income and collective distribution income. Last year, farmers' household operational income and income from collective distribution were 453 yuan and 50 yuan, respectively, both with a growth rate of 18.1% compared to the previous year. In the increase of household operational income, livestock income increased the most; the increase in collective distribution income mainly came from township enterprises.

The survey shows that with the development of the rural commodity economy, income is objectively linked to farmers' quality and operational level, gradually widening the income gap among farmers. From the perspective of the eastern, central, and western economic regions nationwide, the income imbalance between regions is becoming increasingly apparent, with eastern farmers seeing the most significant increase in income. In 1988, the per capita net income in the east was 683 yuan, decreasing sequentially in the central and western regions.

The survey also shows that due to price increases last year, farmers' living consumption and the purchase of production materials resulted in an additional expenditure of 72 yuan per capita; while farmers gained 68 yuan per capita from price increases in agricultural and sideline products and the rise in rural labor prices. After offsetting the gains and losses, price increases resulted in more losses than gains for farmers.

　　国家统计局最新抽样调查表明
　　农民年收入继续增长
　　去年人均纯收入达５４５元
　　物价上涨结果失多得少
    本报讯　国家统计局农调总队的一份最新抽样调查表明，在部分地区遭受自然灾害和生产资料涨价的情况下，去年我国农民收入比上年仍有增长。其中，非农产业收入增长较快，所占比重上升，但物价上涨使农民失多得少。
    据调查，去年农民人均纯收入为５４５元，比上年增加８２元，增长１７．８％；扣除物价上涨因素，农民实际收入比上年增长６．３％。
    去年国家提高了农产品收购价格，但农业收入增长速度仍比非农产业收入增长速度慢。在农民人均纯收入中，来自一、二、三产业的纯收入为４９３元，比上年增长１８．１％。其中，第一产业纯收入比上年增长１４．８％，占一、二、三产业的收入比重由上年的７２．１％下降到７０．１％。二、三产业纯收入比上年增长２６．６％，所占比重由上年的３７．９％上升到３９．９％。
    家庭经营纯收入与集体分配收入同步增长，是去年农民收入变化的又一明显特点。去年农民家庭经营纯收入和从集体分配中得到的收入，分别为４５３元和５０元，与上年相比，增长率均为１８．１％。在家庭经营纯收入增加额中，牧业收入增加最多；集体分配收入增长额则主要来自乡村企业。
    调查表明，随着农村商品经济的发展，客观上把收入与农民的素质、经营水平紧密联系起来，使农民之间收入差距逐步拉大。从全国东、中、西三个经济区看，地区间收入的不平衡也日益明显，其中东部农民收入增加最多，１９８８年人均纯收入为６８３元，中、西部则依次递减。
    调查还表明，由于去年物价上涨，农民生活消费与购买生产资料人均多支出７２元；而农民从农副产品提价和农村劳务价格上涨中，人均多得６８元，收支相抵，价格上涨使农民失多得少。
