Chairman Yang Meets and Hosts Dinner for President Eyadema
Both Sides Stress Development of Friendly Relations Between China and Togo

BEIJING, April 6 (Xinhua) — Chairman Yang Shangkun met with Togolese President Gnassingbé Eyadema this evening at the Great Hall of the People.

During the meeting, Chairman Yang expressed his admiration for President Eyadema's unremitting efforts in developing Togo's economy and improving the living standards of its people. He also praised Eyadema's active role in mediating conflicts and promoting unity among African nations.

When discussing bilateral relations, Chairman Yang noted that the development of relations between the two countries has been smooth, and cooperation has been fruitful. He believed that this visit would further advance the relationship between the two countries.

President Eyadema stated that the primary task for African countries at present is to achieve economic independence following political independence. He emphasized that China's effective cooperation and selfless aid to African countries can help them gain more leverage in the imbalanced global economy.

Before the meeting, Chairman Yang held a ceremony at the East Gate Plaza of the Great Hall of the People to welcome President Eyadema.

After the meeting, Chairman Yang hosted a dinner for the Togolese guests.

In his speech at the dinner, Chairman Yang, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, extended sincere congratulations to the Togolese government and people for their achievements.

He said that the unreasonable international economic relations, especially the increasingly heavy debt burden, seriously hinder the economic development of African countries. The Chinese government is willing to work with the broad African countries to strive for a new international economic order that is fair and just.

Chairman Yang said that due to the efforts of all parties concerned, especially the long-term unyielding struggle of African countries and peoples, United Nations Security Council Resolution 435 has been implemented since April 1. We hope that all parties will seriously fulfill the agreements reached, so that the Namibian elections can be conducted freely and fairly under the effective supervision of the United Nations, and that Namibia can declare independence as scheduled. The Chinese government and people will, as always, firmly support the just struggle of the southern African countries and peoples against the apartheid system, and to safeguard national sovereignty and security.

In his reply, President Eyadema first praised the construction achievements of the Chinese people.

He said that in today's world, rich countries are selfish and unjust phenomena and contempt for poor countries are rampant everywhere, while poor countries are facing poverty, hunger, and various disasters. The global economic crisis has made these disasters even more severe. For developing countries, it manifests as deteriorating trade conditions, continuously falling commodity prices, and increasing debt burdens. He said that in today's environment full of various difficulties, very few countries understand the various thorny problems faced by us countries and, on the basis of fairness and mutual benefit, strengthen cooperation with the African continent in a selfless manner; and China is one of these few countries. Therefore, Togo is pleased to maintain cooperative relations with China.

When discussing the issue of Southern Africa, he expressed the hope that all Namibians would seek common ground while reserving differences, focus their efforts on the development of the country, and build their own country in an atmosphere of peace and harmony.

Those present at the banquet included Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress Yan Jici, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, and the head of the Chinese escort team and Minister of Radio, Film, and Television, Ai Zisheng.

　　杨主席会见并宴请埃亚德马总统
    双方强调发展中国多哥两国友好关系
    本报北京４月６日讯  记者温宪报道：国家主席杨尚昆今天晚上在人民大会堂会见了多哥总统纳辛贝·埃亚德马。
    会见中，杨主席对埃亚德马总统在发展多哥经济、改善人民生活方面所做的不懈努力表示赞赏，对他积极调解非洲国家之间的矛盾和争端、促进非洲团结方面所做的工作表示钦佩。
    在谈到两国关系时，杨主席说，我们两国关系的发展是顺利的，两国的合作很有成效。他相信通过这次访问，两国关系还将得到进一步发展。
    埃亚德马总统说，非洲国家当前最主要的任务是继政治独立后，争取经济独立。而在这方面，中国同非洲国家的有效合作和无私援助，能使非洲国家在世界经济不平衡的天平上增加自己的砝码。
    会见前，杨主席在人民大会堂东门外广场举行仪式欢迎埃亚德马总统。
    会见后，杨主席设宴款待多哥贵宾。
    杨主席在宴会讲话中代表中国政府和人民对多哥政府和人民取得的成就表示衷心祝贺。
    他说，不合理的国际经济关系，特别是日益沉重的债务负担，严重地阻碍着非洲国家经济的发展。中国政府愿和广大非洲国家一道为建立公正的国际经济新秩序共同奋斗。
    杨主席说，由于有关各方的努力，特别是非洲国家和人民长期不屈不挠的斗争，联合国安理会４３５号决议已从４月１日开始付诸实施。我们希望有关各方认真履行达成的协议，使纳米比亚大选能在联合国的有效监督下自由、公正地进行，使纳米比亚能如期宣告独立。中国政府和人民将一如既往，坚决支持南部非洲国家和人民反对种族隔离制度，维护国家主权和安全的正义斗争。
    埃亚德马总统在答辞中首先赞扬了中国人民所取得的建设成就。
    他说，在当今世界上，富国自私自利，到处充斥着不公正现象和对穷国的蔑视，而穷国面临着贫困、饥饿和各种灾难。世界经济危机使这些灾难更加深重。就发展中国家而言，它表现为贸易条件恶化、原料价格不断下跌和外债负担加重。他说，在当今这个充满种种困难的环境中，极少数国家能理解我们这些国家面临的各类棘手问题，并在公平和互通有无的基础上，无私地加强同非洲大陆的合作；而中国就是这少数国家中的一员。因此，多哥对与中国保持合作关系感到高兴。
    在谈到南部非洲问题时，他表示希望所有纳米比亚人求同存异，朝着同一个方向，集中力量于国家的发展，以便在和平与和谐的气氛中建设自己的国家。
    参加宴会的有全国人大副委员长严济慈，外交部长钱其琛，我国陪同团团长、广播电影电视部部长艾知生等。
