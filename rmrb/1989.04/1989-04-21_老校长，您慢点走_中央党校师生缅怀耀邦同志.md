Farewell, Old Principal...

— Central Party School Faculty and Students Mourn Hu Yaobang

Reporters Meng Xian and Liang Xiaqin

“Our old principal, Comrade Hu Yaobang, have you really left us?”

In recent days, the faculty and students of the Central Party School have been immersed in deep remembrance. They seem to see Hu Yaobang, the principal, still working under the unceasing light, still giving lectures to the students in the auditorium, still chatting with teachers in the research rooms…

The unforgettable year was 1977, March. After the first thunder of spring, Comrade Hu Yaobang entered the just-thawed campus, taking on the role of the vice principal of the Central Party School, overseeing daily operations. “During those days, you worked day and night without rest,” colleagues from the *Theoretical Trends* editorial department recalled with deep emotion as they silently made wreaths. They remembered how Hu Yaobang, with the boldness of a selfless revolutionary, personally revised and decided to publish the article “Practice is the Sole Criterion for Testing Truth,” igniting the torch of rectifying wrongs in the ideological and theoretical front…

Former vice principal of the Central Party School, Chen Weiren, who once served as Hu Yaobang’s secretary, gazed at a photo with Hu Yaobang and displayed the poem “Ten years of hard work, not a little, planting peaches and plums to the ends of the earth” that Hu Yaobang gave him. With tears, he said, “Under the personal leadership of Principal Hu, the Central Party School was the first to rectify the cases of 99 ‘rightists’ nationwide, and to clear the names of all members of the ‘Red Combat Group’ who were labeled as a counter-revolutionary organization by Kang Sheng…”

Yes, Principal Hu has not left. His voice, with a thick Hunan accent, still resonates clearly in the ears of the students:

“The Party School must become a stronghold of upholding Marxism-Leninism, a model for inheriting and carrying forward the Party’s fine traditions!”

“In the Party School, we should practice ‘not pulling hair, not beating with sticks, not wearing hats,’ and I will add one more: ‘not putting in bags’!”

In May 1982, he left the Party School for Zhongnanhai, and for field investigations across the country. The faculty and students of the Party School believed he would return, and they patiently waited and hoped…

“Principal, you left too quickly.” That’s what everyone said. Yes, Hu’s right leg was often numb, but he still walked so fast. He was already old, and he had to hurry. Party School student, Vice Director of the Yichun Prefecture of Jiangxi, Jian Mugen, recalled with excitement Hu Yaobang’s visit to the revolutionary old areas of Jiangxi in October 1983, where he inspected six counties in three days. He said, “Comrade Hu Yaobang personally inspected the hydropower station, helping to solve the financial difficulties, and the construction is now in full swing. It is expected to be completed next year. You have the old areas’ people in your heart, and the old areas’ people miss you!”

Party School student Li Yongshou, from September 27 to 30, 1985, accompanied Comrade Hu Yaobang to inspect the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan. He excitedly recalled, “In Ganzi, he often murmured, ‘There are still 18 regions I haven’t visited’; when he arrived in Danba, he said, ‘There are still 17 regions I haven’t visited…’”

“Last year, Comrade Hu Yaobang told me: Originally, I planned to visit every county in the country, but it seems difficult to achieve. There are more than 400 regions in the country, and I still have 10 that I haven’t visited, a few in your hometown Yunnan, and a few in Tibet. I plan to visit them all.” Chen Weiren wiped the tears from the corners of his eyes and choked out, “But he…”

“Old Principal, you walked too tired,” Shaanxi student Teng Yun recalled Principal Hu’s struggle against the “leftist” line when he served as the first secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee, almost covering the entire Shaanxi region in a year, and his two visits to Shaanxi in the past two years. With deep emotion, he said, “You should rest. The roads you didn’t finish, we will continue to walk…”

“Once a person leaves, the heart goes far, with a heart full of affection, who can I tell?” The faculty and students wove a basket of remembrance with bunches of fresh flowers and strands of affection, with couplets written on it:

“The heart of the Party, the heart of the people, the heart of the army, the heart of conscience, all hearts are with the good secretary
	The old and the young, the new and the old, all generations miss the old principal”

The colleagues of the Central Party School carefully made wreaths, mourning the passing of Comrade Hu Yaobang.

　　老校长，您慢点走……   
    ——中央党校师生缅怀耀邦同志
    本报记者  孟西安  梁小琴
    “我们的老校长——耀邦同志，您真的走了吗？”
    近日来，中央党校的师生们沉浸在无限的怀念之中。他们似乎看到：耀邦校长还在不熄的灯光下办公，还在礼堂里给学员讲话，还在教研室内与教师攀谈……
    难忘那１９７７年３月。春雷乍响之后，耀邦同志走进了刚刚解冻的校园，担任中央党校副校长，主持日常工作。“在那些日子里，您没日没夜、没钟没点地干”，《理论动态》编辑部的同志们一边默默地扎着花圈，一边深情地回忆耀邦同志创办《理论动态》刊物的往事。他们没有忘，是耀邦同志以无私无畏的革命家胆略，亲自修改并决定登载《实践是检验真理的唯一标准》的文章，点燃了思想理论战线拨乱反正的火炬……
    曾任耀邦同志秘书的原中央党校副校长陈维仁凝视着与耀邦同志的合影，展示耀邦同志赠给他的“十载辛耘莫嗟少，栽得桃李到瀛蓬”的诗句，含泪说：“在耀邦校长的亲自主持下，率先在全国为党校９９名‘右派’分子全部平了反，为被康生打成反动组织的‘红战团’的全体同志洗了冤……”
    是的，耀邦校长还没有走。他那带着浓厚湖南口音的声音，还响亮地回荡在学员的耳畔：
    “党校要成为坚持马列主义的坚强阵地，成为继承发扬党的优良传统的模范！”
    “在党校，要实行‘不抓辫子，不打棍子，不戴帽子’，我还要加一个：‘不装袋子’！”
    １９８２年５月，他离开党校到中南海去了，到全国各地调查研究去了。党校的师生们相信他还会回来的，他们耐心地盼着，等着……
    “校长，您走得太快了。”大家这么说。是的，耀邦的右腿虽然时常麻木，但他走路仍然那么快。他年事已高，不能不加快步伐。党校学员、江西宜春行署副专员简木根每每回忆起耀邦同志１９８３年１０月到江西革命老区、３天考察６个县的往事，激动不已。他说：“耀邦同志亲自实地考察、并帮助解决资金困难的水电站，正在加紧施工，明年可望竣工。您心里装着老区人民，老区人民念叨着您呀！”
    党校学员李永寿１９８５年９月２７日至３０日曾陪同耀邦同志考察四川甘孜藏族自治州，他激动地回忆道：“他在甘孜，多次喃喃自语‘还有１８个地区没去看看’；来到丹巴，又说‘还有１７个地区没有去看’……”
    “耀邦同志去年年底对我说：原来打算把全国所有的县走一遍，看来难实现了。全国４００多个地区，我还有１０个没顾上去，有几个在你老家云南，有几个在西藏。我打算把它们都跑完。”陈维仁拭擦着眼角的泪花，哽咽地说：“可是，他却……”
    “老校长，您走得太累了，”陕西学员滕云回忆耀邦校长在陕西担任省委第一书记时同“左”的路线作斗争，一年中几乎跑遍三秦大地，前两年又二次到陕西视察的往事，深情地说，“您该歇息了，你没走完的路，我们继续走……”
    “斯人一去天涯远，满腹衷肠诉与谁？”师生们用一束束鲜花和一缕缕情思，编织成追思的花篮，挽联上面写着：
    “党心民心军心良心心心向着好书记
    　先生后生老生新生生生怀念老校长”（附图片）
    中央党校的同志们精心制作花圈，沉痛悼念胡耀邦同志逝世。
