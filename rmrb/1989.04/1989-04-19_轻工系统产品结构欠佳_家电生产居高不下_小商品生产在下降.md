Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 19th.

The reporter Liu Guilian learned from the Ministry of Light Industry that in the first quarter of this year, the national light industry production situation was as follows: the production of home appliances remained high, the production of daily necessities was guaranteed with the support of local governments, and the production of small commodities declined across the board.

In the first quarter, the total industrial output value of the national light industry, supported by home appliance products, reached 54.272 billion yuan (including tobacco), an increase of 10.4% over the same period last year. Compared to the first quarter of last year, the growth rate has slowed down, maintaining an appropriate speed. However, there is regional imbalance. Among them, Guangdong had the highest growth rate of 22.7%, while Hainan Province saw a decrease of 7.1%. Shanghai, Tianjin, Jiangsu, Liaoning, and 16 other provinces and cities had growth rates below the national average.

According to statistics from 19 provinces and cities on 36 major light industry products, in the first quarter compared to the same period last year, the production of refrigerators increased by 49.1%, electric fans by 30.8%, washing machines by 31.9%, vacuum cleaners by 248%, and air conditioners by 222.8%. In the 5 billion yuan increase in light industry output value in the first quarter, home appliances accounted for 2.5 billion yuan. Paper, sugar, salt, matches, soap, and detergent, which are daily necessities, were listed as essential products in various places and received active support in terms of funds and raw materials, as well as financial subsidies, thereby maintaining a certain growth rate. Other daily necessities, especially small commodities such as thermos bottles, light bulbs, daily ceramics, daily enameled products, daily glass products, daily aluminum products, leather, pencils, locks, scissors, cast iron pots, sewing needles, and dry cell batteries, have declined due to rising raw material prices and severe enterprise losses.

Relevant officials from the Ministry of Light Industry pointed out that the production situation in the first quarter shows that according to the industrial policy and preferential policy requirements, the light industry production still has problems with the structure, where products that should be increased have not been increased, and those that should be reduced have not been reduced. The structural issues have not been completely resolved.

　　轻工系统产品结构欠佳
　　家电生产居高不下
　　小商品生产在下降
    本报讯　记者刘桂莲从轻工部获悉：今年一季度全国轻工业生产的状况是：家电生产热度不减，居高不下，群众生活必需品生产在各地政府扶持下得以保证，小商品生产则全面下降。
    今年一季度，全国轻工总产值在家电产品的支撑下，完成５４２．７２亿元（含烟草），比去年同期增长１０．４％，与去年一季度比，增长减缓，保持了适当速度。但地区之间不平衡，其中广东增长速度最高达２２．７％，海南省下降７．１％，上海、天津、江苏、辽宁等１９个省市，低于全国平均增长水平。
    据１９个省市对轻工３６种主要产品的统计，今年一季度与去年同期比，电冰箱增长４９．１％，电风扇增长３０．８％，洗衣机增长３１．９％，吸尘器增长２４８％，空调器增长２２２．８％。在一季度轻工净增的５０亿元产值中，家电占２５亿。纸、糖、盐、火柴、肥皂、洗衣粉等群众生活必需品，各地普遍列入必保产品，在资金、原材料上给予积极支持，财政上给以补贴，从而保持了一定的增长速度。其余一些生活必需品特别是小商品，如保温瓶、灯泡、日用陶瓷、日用搪瓷、日用玻璃、日用精铝制品、皮革、铅笔、锁、剪刀、铸铁锅、缝衣针、干电池等，则因原材料涨价，企业亏损严重，均呈下降之势。
    轻工部有关同志指出，一季度生产状况表明，按照产业政策和倾斜政策的要求，轻工生产仍存在该上的产品没有上去，该压的没压下来，没有完全解决好结构问题。
