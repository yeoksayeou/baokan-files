Selling public housing and realizing housing privatization is a very complex matter, inevitably encountering a series of contradictions and problems. Only by properly handling these relationships can housing privatization proceed smoothly.

"Promoting sales through rentals" is feasible; "promoting sales through sales" is not necessarily optimistic.

This mainly refers to the relationship between selling and renting houses. To implement housing privatization, public housing needs to be sold to individuals. Due to various reasons, only a part of the houses can be sold, while another part (more or less) still needs to be operated in the form of leasing, thus producing the relationship between renting and selling. If the house price is too high, people will not buy houses but prefer to rent. If the rent is not reformed and remains at a few cents per square meter under the welfare system, it will be difficult to promote the sale of houses. In recent years, our housing system reform has mainly focused on the idea of "promoting sales through rentals," that is, raising rents to make people feel that renting is not as good as buying. The various rent-increase and coupon-issuing schemes in Yantai, Tangshan, and other places are basically following the path of promoting sales through rentals. It seems that to implement housing privatization, it is still necessary to coordinate with rent reforms. The idea of "promoting sales through sales," that is, using favorable conditions for selling public housing to attract people to buy public housing, or using nearly administrative means to encourage people to buy public housing, may work in some small towns, but it is difficult to achieve in large and medium-sized cities. Some places think that there is a shortcut to housing privatization, completely ignoring the reform of the rent aspect, which I think is not necessarily optimistic. In recent years, many cities have conducted a large number of surveys, investigations, calculations, and plan formulations for rent increases, coupon issuance, and other schemes to promote sales through rentals. Some have already simulated operations, and this achievement should not be overlooked. I believe that to promote housing privatization, it is still necessary to consider the sale of housing in conjunction with the increase in rent, and promoting sales through rentals is very necessary.

Selling new houses is relatively easy, while selling old houses is relatively difficult.

Currently, some places are selling new houses smoothly, and some people are optimistic about housing privatization. In fact, it is easy to sell newly built public housing, and it is welcomed, which does not mean that old public housing is also easy to sell. There are three reasons for this: First, those who buy new houses are mostly people without housing who urgently need a place to live and need to solve the problem of having a place to stand, so they will buy even if it is more expensive. Those who buy old houses are mostly existing residents who already have a place to live and are beneficiaries, so their desire to buy a house is not as urgent as the former. Second, the number of people buying new houses is ultimately small, and in terms of fund-raising, the state can give some subsidies, and enterprises can provide some subsidies, which is relatively easy to solve. However, the sale of old houses involves a large number of people, a wide range of influences, and great pressure. Whether it is the state, enterprises, or individuals, it is difficult to solve comprehensively. Third, old houses are generally in worse condition than new houses, with poorer supporting facilities, and the design is not as perfect and reasonable as new houses. Therefore, there is a big psychological gap between people buying new and old houses, while the price gap is relatively small, forming a preference for new houses and a dislike for old ones. However, housing privatization mainly promotes a large number of old house residents to be willing and able to buy old houses, to raise housing funds, and to form a virtuous cycle of housing construction. This is a contradiction. To solve this contradiction, first, it is necessary to use the increase in rent and additional rent (above standard) to promote sales through rentals; second, it is necessary to implement certain preferential policies to widen the price gap between new and old houses; third, it is necessary to accelerate the establishment and improvement of the real estate market, allowing the buying and selling of private houses and appreciation, and using people's value-preservation psychology to guide consumption to old housing.

Reasonably determining the house price, too high or too low is not acceptable.

Whether housing privatization can proceed smoothly depends on the reasonable determination of house prices. Currently, there are two trends worth noting: one is that the house price is too high, with some commercial housing prices reaching over 1,000 yuan per square meter, which obviously does not match China's low-income national conditions. The other is that the house price is too low. According to reports, some places sell public old housing to individuals at a price of 10 to 30 yuan per square meter, which is actually giving away state assets. How to make the house price reasonable, both in line with the affordability of the majority of the people and without damaging state assets? For this, the state has set two prices: the new house price is the construction cost plus the land demolition fee, and the old house price is the replacement price. This is undoubtedly a guarantee measure to prevent the loss of state assets. In fact, from the implementation of various places, due to different calculation methods and the purpose of speeding up the sale, they are generally lower than these two prices. I think the determination of housing sales prices must not be done carelessly, neither can it ignore the people's affordability and purchasing power, nor can it treat old public housing as a burden and sell it off. The appropriate housing sales price should be based on the housing expenses in the average income of workers over a certain number of years. In some foreign countries, workers' total income for three to five years can buy a set of housing, while in others, it takes ten to twenty years of total income. How many years China needs is a major issue related to the national economic development strategy, which needs to be considered and decided by the state. Under the current situation where the housing consumption fund has not yet fully entered the salary, the housing price cannot be determined based on the original value of the house, otherwise, workers will not have such strong purchasing power, nor can it be determined based on the price for quick sales. If public housing can be sold quickly and the majority of people can pay off the price at once, this is definitely an overly low and unreasonable price. The correct housing price must be such that part of the people can buy, and among the buyers, only a few can pay off the price at once, while the majority need to rely on bank loans.

The determination of a reasonable housing price must distinguish between different types of housing. For large, well-equipped, and well-conditioned housing, the price should be high, even higher than the value; for small, poorly equipped housing, the price can be lower than the value. Because housing is different from general commodities, it is a necessity of life for people, with the nature of survival resources, enjoyment resources, and development resources. Housing consumption also reflects people's social status and can be passed down to future generations. Moreover, purchasing it is not easy, so people will try to make the housing as high-level as possible if they have the opportunity. For this, it is necessary to adopt appropriate price policies to suppress and widen the price difference.

Catering to the value-preservation psychology of buying houses and preventing speculative behavior in buying houses.

The most attractive aspect of selling public housing is that buying a house can preserve value, and it is not affected by price fluctuations. To make buying a house a means for currency holders to preserve value, it is necessary to allow private houses to enter the market so that buyers can obtain the benefits of housing appreciation. However, it cannot be denied that some people buy houses not purely for consumption needs but for speculation. To both satisfy the people's psychology of buying houses to preserve value and prevent speculative behavior in buying houses, it is necessary to analyze two different situations of housing appreciation. One is the phenomenon of housing price increase due to price increases leading to increased construction costs, which, strictly speaking, can only be called housing price increase and does not belong to the category of appreciation. The other is the price increase of housing due to changes in the surrounding environment, urban development, improvement of transportation conditions, and perfection of infrastructure, which is a real appreciation. For the increased income of the latter, it is caused by the increase in differential income due to national investment, which should be collected in the form of value-added tax and returned to the state, while for the increased income of the former, it should all belong to the owner of the housing.

Improving maintenance services to eliminate after-sales concerns.

China still lacks a well-equipped, complete network, good service, and reasonably priced social housing maintenance service system. After public housing is sold to individuals, the maintenance of the housing will be a problem. Therefore, when implementing housing privatization, it is necessary to strengthen after-sales service. The original property management department and housing maintenance department of the property unit cannot be hastily dissolved or disbanded. Only by strengthening after-sales service and ensuring that housing can be effectively maintained and managed can people buy housing with peace of mind. In the long run, it is necessary to further establish and improve the housing maintenance service system, set up professional and reasonably priced housing maintenance teams to eliminate the after-sales concerns of housing buyers.

　　城市住宅私有化怎样顺利推行？
    以租促售　引导买旧　合理定价　服务售后
    李肇文
    出售公有住宅，实现住宅私有化，是一件非常复杂的事情，必然遇到一系列矛盾和问题。理顺和处理好这些关系，才能使住宅私有化顺利开展。
    “以租促售”，切实可行；“以售促售”，未必乐观。
    这里主要指卖房与租房的关系。要实行住宅私有化，就要把公有住宅卖给私人。由于种种原因，卖的房总是一部分，另一部分（或多或少）还要用租赁形式经营，这就产生租售之间关系。房价太高，人们就不会去买房而宁愿租房。房租不改革，仍然是几分钱一平方米的福利制，卖房也难以推开。这几年，我们搞住宅体制改革，主要思路是“以租促售”，即提高租金，促使人们觉得租房不如买房。烟台、唐山等地的各种提租发券方案基本是以租促售的路子。现在看来，实行住房私有化，仍然要配合房租的改革，想“以售促售”，即用售公房的优惠条件去吸引人们购买公房，或者用近乎行政手段来鼓励人们购公房，这在一些小县镇或许行得通，但在大、中城市恐难实现。有些地方以为住宅私有化有捷径可走，完全抛开房租方面的改革，我看未必乐观。近年来，许多城市对提租发券等，以租促售的方案，作了大量调查、摸底、测算、制定方案等工作，有的已经模拟运转，这个成果不容忽视。我认为推行住宅私有化，还是得把住宅出售与提高租金联系起来考虑，以租促售是很必要的。
    卖新房较易，卖旧房较难。
    目前一些地方出售新房很顺当，有人便对住宅私有化很乐观。其实新建公有住宅出售容易，受欢迎，并不意味着旧公房也容易出售。原因有三：其一，买新房的人大多是无房户，急需房住，要解决立身之地，再贵一些也要买。而买旧房的人大多是自住户，是已有房住的既得利益者，对买房的欲望没有前者那样迫切。其二，买新房的人终究少，在资金筹集上，国家优惠一点，企业补助一点，比较容易解决。而旧房出售，人数多，牵涉面广，压力大，无论国家、企业、个人都难以全面解决。其三，旧房相对讲，总比新房条件差，配套设施差，设计不像新房那样完善和合理，因而人们购买新旧房的心理差距大，而价格差距相对小，形成买房中的喜新嫌旧。但是住宅私有化，主要还是促使广大旧房住户愿意和能够买旧房，以筹集住宅基金，形成住宅建设的良性循环。这就是个矛盾。要解决这个矛盾，一是要利用提高租金，加租（超标）来以租促售；二是实行一定的优惠，拉开新旧房价的差距；三是加速建立和完善房地产市场，允许私房买卖和增值，利用人们保值心理来引导消费力投向旧住宅。
    合理确定房价，太高太低都不可取。
    住宅私有化能否顺利开展，重要关键在于房价的合理制定。目前有两种倾向值得注意：一是房价太高，商品房价格有的高达每平方米１０００多元，这显然不符合我国低收入的国情。二是房价太低。据报载，有的地方将公有旧住宅以每平方米１０至３０元的价格出售给私人，这实际上是把国家财产送人。如何使房价合理，既符合广大群众的承受力，又使国家财产不受损失？对此，国家规定了两个价，新房价是建筑成本加土地拆迁费，旧房价是重置价。这无疑是使国家财产不受损失的保证措施。实际上，从各地施行的情况看，由于测算方法的不同和出于加快出售的目的，一般都低于这两个价格。我认为对住宅售价的确定决不能马虎从事，既不能不考虑人民的承受力、购买力，也不能将旧公房视为包袱，卖出了事。住宅的合适售价应以职工平均一定年数的工资中的住宅费用为基础。国外有的国家只要三五年职工工资总额就可购一套住宅，有的要十几年二十年的工资总额。我国到底要多少，这是关系到国民经济发展战略的大事，须由国家考虑决策。在当前住房消费基金尚未完全进入工资的情况下，房价的制定不能以房屋本来价值为准，不然职工不会有这样大的购买力，也不能为尽快出售而压低的价格为准。如果公房能很快地全卖出去，且大多数人都能一次将价款结清，这肯定是过低的、不合理的价格。正确的房价一定是部分人能够买，而且购买者中只有少数人能一次将价款付清，大多数人要靠银行贷款。
    制定合理的房价，必须区别于住宅类型。对于面积大，设施齐，条件好的住宅，价格应高，甚至高于价值；对于面积小，设施差的住宅，价格可以低于价值。因为住宅毕竟不同于一般商品，它是人们的生活必需品，兼有生存资料、享受资料、发展资料三种性质，住宅消费又反映人们的社会地位，又可传之子孙后代，加之购置一次不易，所以人们只要有可能会尽量把住房搞得高级一些，对此必须采取适当价格政策以抑制、拉开差价。
    照顾买房保值心理，防止买房投机行为。
    出售公有住宅的最诱惑人之处，还在于买房可以保值，它不受物价波动的影响。要使买房成为货币持有者保值的一种手段，就必须让私房进入市场，使买主获得房屋增值的收益。但是也不能否认有些人买房不纯粹是消费性需求，而是为了投机。为了能既满足人民买房保值的心理，又防止购房投机的行为，要分析两种不同的房屋增值情况。一种是住宅价格因物价上涨，导致建筑成本的增加而提高的现象，这种现象严格地说只能称住宅涨价，而不属于增值范畴。另一种是住宅因周围环境的变化，城市的发展，交通条件的改善，基础设施的完备，而引起的价格上涨，这种是真正的增值。对于后者所增加的收入，是因为国家投资而引起的级差收入增加带来的，应该用征收增值税的形式收归国家，而对于前者所增加的收入，则应全部归于住宅的所有者。
    完善维修服务，解除后顾之忧。
    我国还缺乏设施完备、网络齐全、服务良好、收费合理的社会房屋维修服务体系，公有住宅出售给私人后，房屋的维修将是一个问题。因此，实行住宅私有化，一定要加强售后服务，原来产权单位的房管部门、房修部门，不能贸然撤销、解散。只有加强售后服务，保证住宅能得到经常的有效的维修和管理，人们才会放心地去购买住宅。从长远看，要进一步建立健全房屋维修服务体系，成立专业的收费合理的房屋维修队，以解除买房者的后顾之忧。
