The premature arrival of civilization lacks guarantees of public morality: Shenyang street phone booths in ruins

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, April 19th — (Reporters Lí Xiāndōng of the Shenyang Daily and Zhou Bǎohuá of Xinhua News Agency) The unattended public phone booths, which add a modern touch to the city, have become an eyesore in many parts of Shenyang.

In recent years, Shenyang City has invested 650,000 yuan to install 91 coin-operated public phones along busy streets, of which 53 are high-end phone booths with aluminum frames and glass panels. Recently, reporters observed while riding bicycles along the streets that there were very few phone booths with intact glass panels. The coin slots of most phones were filled with matches, metal sheets, and hard paper. Many earphones were missing, and some entire phone sets had vanished. Despite the telecommunications department's efforts to strengthen maintenance and ensure two inspections per day, they still cannot keep up with the damage caused by those lacking social morality.

Public opinions on the vandalism of phone booths vary. Some believe that setting up unattended phone booths on the streets is a premature move, and that during this stage, more effort should be put into developing proxy public phone services. Others believe that unattended phone booths are still necessary, and the key lies in strengthening education and management. The "disheveled" and "disarrayed" coin-operated phone booths standing on the streets of Shenyang seem to pose a big question: Is this a premature civilization, or a delayed public morality?

　　早来的文明缺乏公德教育保证
　　沈阳街头电话亭破败不堪
    据新华社沈阳４月１９日电　（《沈阳日报》记者黎先东、新华社记者周保华）为城市增添现代化色彩的无人看守电话亭，许多在沈阳已成为有碍市容观瞻的摆设。
    沈阳市近几年耗资６５万元，在繁华街道旁安装了９１个投币式公用电话，其中有５３个是铝型材框架、镶嵌玻璃的高档电话亭。最近记者骑自行车沿街观察，所见电话亭四壁玻璃完好无损的已寥寥无几，绝大多数电话的投币通道被火柴、铁皮和硬纸等异物塞满；耳机丢失的为数不少，有的连整部话机也不翼而飞。尽管电信部门花了很大力量加强维修，保证每日巡修两次，但仍跟不上缺少社会公德的人的破坏。
    对电话亭的遭劫现象，此间公众的看法也不一致。有人认为在街头设置无人看守话亭属超前现象，现阶段还应多发展代办公用电话业务，也有人认为无人看守电话亭还需设立，关键是加强教育和管理。伫立在沈阳市街头的一个个“丢盔卸甲”、狼狈不堪的投币式电话亭，本身似乎就是一个大问号：这是早来的文明，还是迟到的公德？
