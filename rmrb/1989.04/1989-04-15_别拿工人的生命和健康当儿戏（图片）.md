On March 18th, we visited several privately-owned glass fiber processing factories that had set up in vacant military barracks. The young rural girls employed there work in dimly lit, dusty, and air-polluted operation rooms with tangled electrical wiring. The equipment is extremely rudimentary, and the environment is appalling. It is astonishing how such factories could obtain business licenses and be approved to operate. Shouldn't the relevant departments inspect and rectify these factories? For heaven's sake, don't toy with the workers' lives and health!

　　别拿工人的生命和健康当儿戏
    3月18日，我们参观了几家个体户利用部队空闲营房开办的玻璃纤维加工厂。被雇用的农村小姑娘，工作在光线昏暗，粉尘飞扬，空气污浊，电器线路乱如蛛网的操作间里，其设备之简陋，环境之恶劣，实在令人吃惊。真不知这样的加工厂是怎样取得营业执照被批准开业的？有关部门难道不应该对这些厂子进行审查和整顿？千万别拿工人的生命和健康当儿戏！
