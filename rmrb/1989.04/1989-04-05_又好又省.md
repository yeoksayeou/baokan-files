The offices of Hunan, Jiangxi, Shandong, Fujian, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Jilin provinces in Beijing have adhered to the principle of thrift in hosting representatives from Jiangsu, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Jilin.

The seven provincial offices have designated specific individuals for purchasing supplies, and the cooks and servers have been meticulous in managing the use of grains and vegetables. The Hunan office's canteen operates on a cafeteria-style system with a point-based menu, offering high, medium, and low-priced meals with a variety of options. This approach not only caters to the convenience of diners but also minimizes waste. Li Fuxing, the director of the canteen, wears his work uniform and leads four frontline servers to provide enthusiastic service. The Zhejiang office's canteen also ensures the efficient use of grains and vegetables, avoiding waste. The service company of the seven provincial offices strives to conserve water, electricity, and coal while maintaining service quality. They implement a 24-hour duty system, rationally scheduling evening bathing water usage, and have saved 15 tons of coal over 20 days. For the three main gates, they have assigned specific personnel to manage the lighting, starting with small savings.
