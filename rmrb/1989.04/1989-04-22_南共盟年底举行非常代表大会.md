The 22nd Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia reconvened this morning at the Sava Center. After a heated discussion involving 34 members of the Central Committee, a decision was passed by a majority vote, based on a proposal from the Presidium of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in response to requests from the League of Communists of Vojvodina, Serbia, and Montenegro. The decision states that the League of Communists of Yugoslavia will convene its 14th Extraordinary Congress in December this year. This congress will have all the functions and characteristics of a regular congress, with the agenda being "Social Reform and League Reform." The venue will be determined through consultations among the League organizations of the republics, autonomous provinces, and the People's Army.

During today's session, the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia passed decisions on the convocation of the congress, the standards and procedures for electing representatives, the composition of the preparatory committee for the extraordinary congress, and the establishment of a committee responsible for revising the League's charter and preparing the work report of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. The Central Committee also decided that each republic and autonomous province should hold their own regional congresses before the extraordinary congress. The Central Committee, in accordance with the principles of cadre renewal and separation of party and government, accepted the resignations of five comrades from their positions as members of the Central Committee, including J. Vrhovec and A. Marković, members of the Federal Presidency and the Federal Government, respectively. Due to health reasons, former Prime Minister M. Planić also resigned from his position as a member of the Central Committee.
