The Kingdom of Bahrain is located in the central part of the Gulf, consisting of 33 islands, with a total area of 662 square kilometers. The main island, Bahrain Island, is the largest, and the capital, Manama, is located at the northern end of this island.

In the 7th century AD, Bahrain became part of the Arab Empire's Basra Province. In 1820, Britain invaded Bahrain, forcing it to sign the "General Treaty of Peace in the Persian Gulf." After 1880, it effectively became a British protectorate. On August 14, 1971, Bahrain gained full independence.

Bahrain has a population of 427,000, of which over 200,000 are Bahrainis, with the rest being foreigners. The official language is Arabic, but due to its history as a British colony, English is also widely spoken. Islam is the state religion.

Oil and natural gas are the lifeblood of Bahrain's economy. Oil revenue accounts for half of the fiscal income. The island is home to large refineries, the Middle East's largest aluminum smelter, and the world-renowned Bahrain Dry Dock. Major agricultural products include dates, citrus fruits, and alfalfa. Bahrain's coastal waters are rich in pearls, making it the center of the Gulf's pearl industry.

Since its independence, Bahrain has pursued a policy of economic diversification, developing basic industries while actively promoting the financial and tourism sectors. Currently, there are over 170 banks operating in Bahrain, with deposits totaling approximately $63 billion, making it one of the international financial centers. Bahrain's terrain is flat, with lush trees, beautiful scenery, and convenient transportation and communication. The government implements more open and free policies compared to other Gulf countries. Since the Saudi-Bahrain Causeway opened at the end of 1986, it has further boosted Bahrain's tourism industry, which in turn has promoted commercial prosperity. The policy of economic diversification has enabled Bahrain to join the ranks of the wealthy Gulf nations.

Bahrain implements a fully funded education system and free medical care.

Bahrain has close trade relations with China. In its import trade, China ranks fourth.

　　海湾岛国——巴林
    巴林国位于海湾的中部，是由３３个岛屿组成的群岛之国，面积６６２平方公里。它的主岛巴林岛最大，首都麦纳麦位于该岛的北端。
    公元７世纪，巴林成为阿拉伯帝国巴士拉省的一部分。１８２０年英国入侵巴林，迫其签订了《波斯湾总和平条约》。１８８０年以后实际上成为英国的保护国。１９７１年８月１４日巴林获得完全独立。
    巴林全国人口４２．７万，其中巴林人２０多万，其余为外籍人。官方语言为阿拉伯语，因原为英国殖民地，所以英语也很流行。巴林以伊斯兰教为国教。
    石油和天然气是巴林的经济命脉。石油收入占财政收入１／２。岛上设有大型炼油厂、中东最大的炼铝厂和驰名世界的巴林干船坞。主要农产品有椰枣、柑桔、苜蓿等。巴林沿海产珍珠，是海湾珍珠采集业中心。
    巴林自独立以来就奉行经济多样化的政策，在发展基础工业的同时积极发展金融业和旅游业。目前，在巴林开业的银行有１７０多家，存款约６３０亿美元，使它成为国际金融中心之一。巴林全境地势低平，树木茂盛，风景优美，交通和通讯都很便利。政府实行比其它海湾国家更为开放和自由的政策，沙特—巴林跨海大桥自１９８６年底通车以来，更推动了巴林旅游业的发展，旅游又促进了商业的繁荣。经济多样化的政策使巴林跻身海湾富裕国家行列。
    巴林实行全公费的教育制度和免费医疗制度。
    巴林与我国贸易往来较密切。在其进口贸易中，我国居第４位。
