Some enterprises and institutions have been involved in criminal activities, leading to an increase in the value of smuggling cases in Guangdong. The number of cases has decreased, but the value of the cases has increased. Last year, various anti-smuggling departments in the province investigated a total of 14,000 smuggling cases, a 23% decrease from the previous year. However, the total value of fines and confiscations amounted to 470 million yuan, a 92% increase from the previous year.

Notably, some enterprises and institutions have participated in smuggling and private trading. In some places, local party and government leaders have encouraged and tolerated these activities, exacerbating the situation. Recently, it was discovered that the Nan'ao County Deep Bay Town Litchi City Development Company and the Aquaculture Development Company had smuggled in a large quantity of cigarettes. This deal was approved by the town's party secretary and the town's mayor and deputy mayors. In Rao Ping County, Hai Shan Town's Hai Shan Industrial Products Trading Company smuggled 5,000 boxes of cigarettes in nine separate instances last May, with an estimated value of over 10 million yuan. The town's party secretary, Huang Dezhi, even said, "If caught, it's just a violation, not a crime. You can go ahead and do it, and if anything happens, the collective will take responsibility."

It is reported that the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have made a decision to quickly organize forces to launch a special campaign to crack down on smuggling. They will focus on rectifying the grassroots level and internal units as a fundamental measure.

　　一些企事业单位参与犯罪
　　广东走私案值增加
    本报广州４月１９日电　记者梁兆明报道：“案件减少，案值增加”，是广东走私活动的新动向。去年，全省各缉私部门共查获走私案件１．４万多宗，比前年减少２３％；罚没总值４．７亿多元，比前年增加９２％。
    值得注意的是，一些企事业单位参与走私贩私，有些地方党政领导的怂恿放纵，对走私活动起了推波助澜作用。前不久查获的南澳县深澳镇榴城开发公司、水产养殖发展公司大量走私进口烟，就是由该镇镇委书记和镇长、副镇长等人拍板成交的。饶平县海山镇的海山工业品贸易公司去年５月开办以来，先后走私香烟９次共５０００多箱，估值１０００多万元。该镇镇委书记黄德志竟说：“一旦被发现，只属犯规，不是犯罪。你们大胆去干，将来有了事由集体承担。”
    据悉，广东省委、省政府已作出决定，迅速组织力量，开展一次打击走私的专项斗争。把切实整顿基层，整顿内部单位作为一项治本工作。
