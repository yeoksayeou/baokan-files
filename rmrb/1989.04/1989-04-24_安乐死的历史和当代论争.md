Euthanasia involves various aspects such as medicine, law, and ethics, as well as relationships between doctors, patients, families, and society, raising many new issues and sparking widespread and intense debates. This article provides a brief overview of the history and development of euthanasia, as well as the basic viewpoints of both sides of the debate. As modern medical science advances, people's understanding of euthanasia is also changing.

Currently, the issue of euthanasia has garnered the attention of the global public. It not only touches on theoretical concepts in medicine, law, and ethics but also directly affects the lives of millions of people.

The term euthanasia (euthanasia) originates from Greek, composed of the words "eu" (ease) and "thanatos" (death). Its original meaning was to die painlessly and mercifully, later extended to mean dying painlessly and peacefully. In ancient Sparta, it was customary to kill infants born with disabilities. Ancient Greek philosophers and politicians like Plato and Pythagoras either advocated suicide as a means of escape when suffering from incurable diseases or believed that it was reasonable to euthanize the elderly and the weak voluntarily.

In the Middle Ages, religions such as Christianity, Judaism, and Islam preached that life and death are gifts from God, thus prohibiting suicide and euthanasia. After the Renaissance, humanism emerged, emphasizing the dignity of life, and did not advocate for euthanasia. Some thinkers like Bacon proposed that in his utopia, citizens could voluntarily practice euthanasia. To this day, many countries' written laws do not allow the practice of euthanasia. However, in real life, people and courts generally take a tolerant attitude towards doctors helping patients to voluntarily practice euthanasia. In 1935, in Britain, and later in the United States, the Federal Republic of Germany, Northern Europe, Japan, and many other countries, social groups advocating for voluntary euthanasia emerged. However, their activities have never led to legislation.

In the past two to three decades, the issue of euthanasia has been raised again. One important reason is that medical advancements allow patients with no hope of recovery to prolong their lives, even becoming "vegetative" with only the most basic life functions and no consciousness. This practice consumes enormous resources. It is estimated that the United States spends over $1.5 billion annually on this. Sometimes, this approach actually increases the patient's suffering and puts doctors in a dilemma between prolonging life and relieving pain. In such circumstances, more and more medical professionals and other scholars are calling for the legalization of euthanasia.

Euthanasia is a complex issue. It can be divided into passive (negative) and active (positive); voluntary and non-voluntary; terminal and non-terminal.

Generally, passive terminal euthanasia is more acceptable to people. It involves not providing any treatment other than painkillers and sedatives to patients who are inevitably going to die and are suffering greatly, and removing all life-support measures, allowing them to die peacefully. This is close to natural death. If this is done voluntarily by the patient, it is less likely to be criticized legally or ethically. However, the first implementation of this method also sparked legal debates. For example, in 1977, the Quillan couple in New Jersey insisted on removing the ventilator maintaining their daughter's life, allowing her to "die with dignity and respect," but were refused by the doctor. After appealing, the state's high court ruled, and their request was finally granted. This ruling has since been widely cited.

People who choose voluntary euthanasia can also write a "living will" in advance, authorizing doctors not to use artificial means to prolong their lives when they are terminally ill. Starting in 1977, 38 states in the United States passed the "Death with Dignity Act," requiring doctors to respect patients' wishes.

The issue of whether passive euthanasia can be applied to "vegetative" patients is a difficult one. These patients only have their lives sustained by passive feeding and high-tech equipment, completely losing consciousness. At this point, simply removing life-support measures can lead to death. However, this action often encounters obstacles.

In 1983, a firefighter in Massachusetts underwent brain surgery and never regained consciousness, completely dependent on a feeding tube for survival. After 2 years and 7 months, the court still ruled to prohibit the removal of the feeding tube. The issue of passive euthanasia for infants with congenital disabilities is also a challenge. Every year, millions of infants worldwide are born with severe intellectual disabilities or physical deformities. Most of these infants cannot survive or grow up, but a significant number are kept alive through medical technology, posing a heavy burden on families and society. In the 1960s, in the Federal Republic of Germany, the use of a drug to treat pregnancy reactions resulted in the birth of thousands of infants with short-limb deformities, resembling seals, known as "seal babies." Some were abandoned and died, while others were raised and, through the use of prosthetics, gained some ability to live.

The debate over active euthanasia is even greater. This type of euthanasia involves using artificial means to cause the death of patients suffering greatly or those who have lost the meaning of life. While this can relieve the patient's suffering and the burden on the family and society, it is essentially a deliberate act of killing, which is considered murder in legal terms and is often widely opposed. Currently, except for Uruguay, where the law does not prosecute active euthanasia, almost all countries consider it a special form of murder.

In the spring of 1988, the Netherlands sentenced four nurses who performed euthanasia on severely comatose patients to murder. In January 1988, the American Medical Association Journal published an anonymous short article by a young doctor describing how he, at the request of a terminally ill cancer patient in extreme pain, administered a morphine injection to end her life. This was the first case of active euthanasia published in an American medical journal, sparking intense debate.

Opponents of active euthanasia emphasize that one of the foundations of contemporary society's laws and ethics is the affirmation of the right to life, which cannot be arbitrarily taken away; medical advancements have turned many previously incurable diseases into treatable ones, and if euthanasia is widely practiced, it may affect medical researchers' efforts to further develop life-saving technologies, and even lead to the loss of life for some patients who could be saved due to misjudgment; it could also provide an opportunity for those with malicious intentions to commit murder. Many doctors believe that this would damage the doctor's image as a protector of life and lose the trust of the people.

Supporters, however, argue that the potential dangers mentioned can be prevented through strict legal measures. In 1962, the Nagoya High Court in Japan ruled in a case where a man killed his disabled father that legitimate active euthanasia should meet the following conditions: the patient has an incurable disease and is about to die; the patient is suffering unbearable pain; the sole purpose of causing the patient's death is to relieve their suffering; the patient, while conscious, genuinely and earnestly requests or agrees to euthanasia; the method of killing must be ethically acceptable and must be carried out by a doctor (or, in special circumstances, by another appropriate person).

In 1988, a committee appointed by the Dutch government also proposed similar guidelines, which may be accepted by legislation.

People's understanding of euthanasia is constantly changing. According to a survey by the National Opinion Research Center in the United States, the percentage of people supporting euthanasia was 37% in 1947, 51% in 1973, and 63% in 1983.

Since 1987, public opinion polls in Britain and France have shown that supporters account for 72% and 76%, respectively. It seems that a universal understanding of euthanasia and its implementation under strict legal supervision may not be far off.

　　安乐死的历史和当代论争
    廖有谋
    编者按安乐死涉及到医学、法律、道德等各个方面和医生、病人、家庭、社会等多种关系，提出了许多新问题，引起了广泛而激烈的争论。本文概要介绍了安乐死的历史和发展以及争论双方的基本观点。随着现代医学科学的发展，人们对安乐死的认识也在发生变化。
    当前，安乐死问题已经引起世界公众的关注。它不仅牵涉到医学、法律、伦理等的理论概念，而且直接关系到千万人的实际生活。
    安乐死这个名词（ｅｕｔｈａｎａsｉａ）源自希腊文，由安逸（ｅｕ）和死（ｔｈａｎａｔｏｓ）两个词素构成。其原意是无痛地仁慈地处死，后来被扩大应用为无痛地安乐地死去。在古希腊的斯巴达城邦，对生下的病废婴儿习惯上加以处死。古希腊柏拉图、毕达哥拉斯等思想家与政治家们，或则赞成当病痛无法治疗时用自杀作为解脱的手段，或则认为，对于老人与衰弱者，经自愿使之安乐死是合理的。
    进入中世纪后，基督教、犹太教、伊斯兰教等宣扬人的生死是神的赐予，因而禁止自杀与安乐死。文艺复兴以后，人文主义兴起，赋予人以生的尊严，也不提倡安乐死。有的思想家如培根则主张，在他的乌托邦中，公民可以自愿地实行安乐死。直到现在，许多国家的成文法都不允许实施安乐死。不过，在实际生活中，人民和法庭对医生帮助病人自愿实行安乐死，大都采取宽容的态度。１９３５年在英国，后来在美国以及联邦德国、北欧、日本等许多国家，相继出现争取自愿安乐死的社会团体。但他们的活动始终未能导致立法。
    近二三十年来，安乐死问题又被重新提起。一个重要原因是医学的发展使无希望治愈的病人能长时间地拖延生命，甚至成为只能维持最低生命活动而毫无意识的“植物人”。这样做耗费巨大。据估计，美国每年为此耗资１５亿美元以上。这样做有时反而增加病人的痛苦，同时也使医生在延长生命和消除痛苦两项天职之间陷入矛盾境地。在这种情况下，越来越多的医学家和其他学者呼吁使安乐死合法化。
    安乐死是一个复杂的问题。细分起来，安乐死有消极（被动）的，有积极（主动）的；有自愿的，有非自愿的；有临终的，有非临终的。
    一般来说，施行消极的临终的安乐死较易为人们所接受。它是对于遭受巨大痛苦的不可避免要死亡的病人，除了止痛、镇静药物外不再给予其他治疗，并撤去一切生命支持措施，让其平静地死去。这接近于自然死亡。如果这又出于病人自愿，则在法律上、伦理上都不大会遭到非议。但在首次实施这种方法时也引起过法律论争。例如，１９７７年，美国新泽西州昆兰夫妇坚持要求将维持他们女儿生命的人工呼吸器撤除，让她“体面而尊严”地死去，遭到医生拒绝。最后经过上诉，该州高级法院裁决后，他们的要求才得以实现。此后，这个判例被广泛援用。
    志愿安乐死的人还可以预先立下书面文件，称为“预嘱”，授权医生在他们临终时不采用人工手段延长生命。１９７７年起，美国有３８个州通过了《死亡权力法案》，要求医生尊重病人的这种愿望。
    对“植物人”能不能采用消极安乐死，是一个难题。这些病人只由被动喂饲及高技术仪器支持着“人工生命”，完全丧失意识。这时，只要撤去生命支持手段，即可导致死亡。但是这样做也常常遇到障碍。
    １９８３年，美国马萨诸塞州一名消防队员在作颅内手术后，一直未恢复意识，完全靠胃管喂饲维持，在２年７个月后，法院仍判决禁止撤除胃管。对先天病废婴儿的消极安乐死，也是一个难题。全世界每年要出生以百万计的智力极度低下或身体严重残缺的婴儿。这种婴儿通常半数以上不能成活或长大，但仍有相当一部分靠医学技术而长期生存，这对家庭和社会都是很大的负担。６０年代在德意志联邦共和国曾由于使用一种治疗妊娠反应的药物而导致生下几千名短肢畸形的婴儿，他们形同海豹，称为“海豹怪胎”。其中一部分被舍弃死去，另有相当一部分被抚养长大，并通过安装假肢，获得一定的生活能力。
    对待积极的安乐死，争论则更大。这种安乐死，是用人工方法促使遭受巨大痛苦的病人或失去生存意义的人死亡。这样做虽然可以解除病人的痛苦和家庭、社会的负担，但实际上是一种有目的的杀人行为，在法律上可以认为是谋杀，因此经常遭到普遍的反对。目前世界各国，除了乌拉圭的法律对积极安乐死不予追究外，几乎所有国家都把它作为一种特殊的杀人罪。
    １９８８年春，荷兰还把４名给严重昏迷病人施行安乐死的护士以谋杀罪而判刑。１９８８年１月，美国医学会杂志刊载了一名年轻医生的不署名短文，描述自己怎样应一位极度痛苦的临终癌症病人的口头要求，为她注射吗啡，结束生命。这是美国医学杂志上首次发表积极安乐死的病例，结果引起激烈的争论。
    反对积极安乐死的人强调：当代社会法律和伦理的基石之一是肯定人有生命的权利，这个权利不能被任意剥夺；医学的发展使许多过去的不治之症成为可治，如果广泛实行安乐死，有可能影响医学家以最大努力进一步研究挽救生命的技术，甚至可能因判断失误而使一些尚能救治的病人失去生命；它还可能给一些图谋不轨、阴谋杀人者以可乘之机。许多医生认为这样会有损于医生作为生命保护者的崇高形象，失去人们的信赖。
    支持者则认为，上述潜在危险可以应用严格的法律手段来加以防止。１９６２年日本名古屋高级法院在一名男子杀害病废父亲的判例中规定，正当的积极安乐死应符合下列条件：病人患有现代医学无法治疗的疾病且即将死亡；病人受到不可忍受的痛苦折磨；使病人死亡的唯一目的是解除其痛苦；病人在神志清醒时确实恳切要求或同意实施安乐死；处死的方式必须是伦理上可接受的处死必须由医生（特殊情况下由其他适当的人）来执行。
    １９８８年荷兰政府指定的一个委员会也提出了类似的准则，并有可能被接受立法。
    人们对安乐死的认识在不断变化。据美国全国民意研究所调查，赞成安乐死者１９４７年为３７％，１９７３年为５１％，１９８３年为６３％。
    １９８７年以来英国和法国的民意测验表明，赞成者分别为７２％和７６％。看来，在世界范围内对安乐死达到普遍理解，并在严格的法律监督下将其推广施行，可能为期不远了。
