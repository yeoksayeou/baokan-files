Kei Xingwen on Current Enterprise Ideological and Political Work: Focus on Situation Education to Create a Stable Social Environment

Reporters Li Qi and Gong Yongquan report: Kei Xingwen, a member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, today at the Fifth Annual Meeting of the Chinese Workers' Ideological and Political Work Research Association, spoke on how to further strengthen enterprise ideological and political work.

He pointed out that the current focus of enterprise ideological and political work is to, through situation education, unite all workers, boost spirits, build confidence, work hard, and provide a strong ideological and political guarantee for the completion of rectification, adjustment, and deepening of reforms.

He said that in situation education and ideological and political work, it is essential to remind the broad masses of the people, including Communist Party members, to maintain the tradition of hard work and self-reliance.

He emphasized that in situation education, it is crucial to raise awareness of the importance of maintaining stability and unity and creating a stable social environment. Economic development and systemic reforms require a stable political situation. Without a stable environment, everything will be in vain, and the achievements already made will be lost. The democracy we aim to build is socialist democracy that suits China's national conditions. This will be a process that must be led, step-by-step, and carried out in a solid manner.

Kei Xingwen also called for enterprises to further implement the "Enterprise Law" and the "Notice from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Strengthening and Improving Enterprise Ideological and Political Work," and to quickly establish a new system for enterprise ideological and political work under the full responsibility of the factory director.

He also pointed out that the initiative and creativity of the workers are the source of vitality for enterprises. Implementing the factory director responsibility system must strengthen enterprise democratic management, enhance workers' participation awareness, and fully leverage the role of the broad masses of workers as masters. One cannot use the full responsibility of the factory director to exclude the status of workers as masters, nor can one use the maintenance of workers' status as masters to negate the factory director responsibility system. The relationship between the two is not one of opposition but of mutual support and interdependence.

Kei Xingwen finally hoped that various places would seriously summarize and promote the experience of the new system for enterprise ideological and political work, further understand, adapt, and familiarize themselves with the new system, and that factory directors and secretaries would quickly take their positions. He said that solving this problem requires the courage to practice, to gain experience through practice, and to create experiences. One should not just talk about it.

　　芮杏文谈当前企业思想政治工作
    重点抓好形势教育  创造稳定社会环境
    本报南京４月２日电  记者李茜、龚永泉报道：中共中央书记处书记芮杏文，今天在中国职工思想政治工作研究会第五届年会上就当前如何进一步做好企业思想政治工作发表讲话。
    他指出，当前，企业思想政治工作的重点，仍然是通过形势教育，团结全体职工，振奋精神，增强信心，艰苦奋斗，为完成治理、整顿和深化改革提供强有力的思想政治保证。
    他说，在形势教育和思想政治工作中，一定要告诫包括共产党员在内的广大人民群众，保持艰苦奋斗的传统。
    他强调指出，在形势教育中，提高对维护安定团结和创造一个稳定的社会环境的重要性的认识，是企业思想政治工作所要把握的大局。经济要发展，体制要改革，首先要有一个稳定的政治局面。没有稳定的环境，什么都吹了，已经取得的成果也会失掉。我们所要建设的民主，是符合我国国情的社会主义民主。这要有一个过程，必须有领导、有步骤、扎扎实实地进行。
    芮杏文在讲话中还要求各企业进一步贯彻《企业法》和《中共中央关于加强和改进企业思想政治工作的通知》，尽快建立厂长全面负责下的企业思想政治工作新体制。
    他还指出，职工的积极性和创造性，是企业活力的源泉。实行厂长负责制，必须加强企业的民主管理，增强职工的参与意识，充分发挥广大职工的主人翁作用。不能以厂长全面负责为理由排斥职工的主人翁地位，也不能以维护职工的主人翁地位来否定厂长负责制。两者的关系不是对立排斥，而是相辅相成、相互依赖的关系。
    芮杏文最后希望各地认真总结、推广企业思想政治工作新体制的经验，进一步理解、适应、熟悉新体制，厂长、书记要尽快到位。他说，解决这个问题，关键是要勇于实践，在实践中增长才干，创造经验，不要坐而论道。
