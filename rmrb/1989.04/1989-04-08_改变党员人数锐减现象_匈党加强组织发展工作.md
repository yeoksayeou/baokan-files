Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, April 6th.

The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party's leader in charge of organizational development, Biro Jeno, told the Hungarian News Agency that the party will actively strengthen its organizational development work in the future, particularly focusing on recruiting more young party members.

Biro said that the primary condition for admitting new members in the future will be their acceptance of the party's reform policies and innovative goals. At the same time, the party constitution will be amended to eliminate the practice of requiring new members to be approved by the next higher-level party organization after being approved by the primary party organization. The practice of requiring two sponsors for joining the party will also be changed.
