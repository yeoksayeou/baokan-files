Title: The Most Precious Thing in the World is True Emotion

I love reading biographies of famous people, especially their letters. Reading the *Selected Letters of Famous Chinese and Foreign Figures* published by Gansu People's Publishing House at night, I couldn't sleep, closing the book and reflecting, what stirred the heart was nothing but emotion.

These letters have various styles; some are stern, some are humorous; some have grand momentum, some have minute details; some are fresh and elegant, some are humorous and implicit; some are rich in philosophy, some are witty and eloquent, reading them is quite interesting. Some of these letters can be considered masterpieces in the literary world. Like Washington's letter to his wife Martha, Franklin's letter to his niece Heba, Lincoln's letter to his half-brother Johnstden, Curie's letter to her niece Zalai, Zheng Banqiao's letter to his cousin Zheng Mo, etc., each one is exquisite, both inspiring oneself and worthy of giving to others.

Excellent letters are an alloy of "emotion" and "reason." No matter how intense, deep, or subtle the emotions are, once they are separated from reason, they will appear pale and powerless. I particularly pay attention to the letters that discuss the principle of "educating children to become talents."

The desire for sons to become dragons and daughters to become phoenixes has become a common psychology among parents. If in social and economic life there is a trend of excessive consumption demand, then in social and cultural life there is a corresponding trend of overly high expectations for children. Wu Yuxia from Qinghai Province beat her nine-year-old son Xia Fei to death because he scored less than 90 in two subjects. Afterward, Wu Yuxia committed suicide in despair. Just as this tragedy ended, Li Liancheng from Dalian City beat his 14-year-old middle school student son Li Guobin to death because the child's grades dropped and lost confidence, leading to truancy. Are there still more children being suppressed and coerced by various invisible pressures from the family? Therefore, I suggest that parents read Lao She's letter written during the War of Resistance from Chongqing to his wife Hu Qing in Beijing: "Children's intelligence is not uniform, and they should not be forced, which may harm their body and mind. I think that if they can roughly recognize a few characters, know a bit of addition and subtraction, and know a little history, it is enough. As long as they are physically strong, they can learn a trade in the future to make a living, and it is not necessary to enter university. If I see my daughter dancing and speaking, with the hope of becoming a star, and my son is as healthy as an ox, can endure hardship and toil, I will be very happy!" Forcing children to do what they cannot do often has the opposite effect! I see many famous people's troubles in educating their children, but their wisdom lies in: not forcing their children, being good at inspiring, being good at guiding, and being good at discovering the best or relatively best point of growth in children's abilities, this is what truly loves children.

Why are letters worth more than ten thousand pieces of gold? The most precious thing in the world is true emotion.

### 人间最贵是真情

　　人间最贵是真情
    王通讯
    我爱读名人传记，尤爱读名人书信。夜读甘肃人民出版社出版的《中外名人家书选粹》，不能成寐，掩卷沉思，撩动人心者，莫外乎情也。
    这些家书风格多样，有的严正，有的诙谐；有的气势宏大，有的取材细小；有的清新秀丽，有的幽默含蓄；有的富于哲理，有的妙语连珠，读来饶有趣味。其中一些家书堪称文学之林的上乘之作。像华盛顿写给妻子玛莎的信，富兰克林写给侄女赫巴的信，林肯写给异母兄弟约翰斯登的信，居里夫人写给外甥女扎拉伊的信，郑板桥写给堂弟郑墨的信等等，无不篇篇锦绣，既可用以自励，又可用以赠人。
    上乘的家书，乃是“情”与“理”的合金。无论多么热辣深沉细腻的情感，一旦离开了理，便会显得苍白无力。信札中涉及“教子成才”之理的，我尤为留意。
    望子成龙，盼女成凤，已经成为家长们的普遍心理。如果说在社会经济生活中存在着一种消费需求过旺的趋势的话，那么在社会文化生活中则存在着一种与之相对立的对子女期望值过高的趋势。青海省的吴玉霞将她的亲生儿子、９岁的夏斐活活打死，起因是两门功课成绩低于９０分。事后吴玉霞饮恨自杀。此起悲剧刚刚结束，大连市的李连盛又将其儿子、１４岁的中学生李国斌毒打致死，起因是孩子学习成绩下降，失去信心而逃学。是不是还有更多孩子正在被各种无形的来自家庭的压力抑制着、逼迫着呢？为此，我建议家长们都来读一读老舍先生抗战期间从重庆写给在北京的妻子胡絜青的信：老舍“儿女聪明不齐，不可勉强，致有损身心。我想，他们能粗识几个字，会点加减法，知道一点历史，便已够了。只要身体强壮，将来能学一份手艺，即可谋生，不必非入大学不可。假若看到我的女儿会跳舞演讲，有作明星的希望，我的男孩能体健如牛，吃得苦，受得累，我必非常欢喜！”强儿所难，往往适得其反！我看到许多名人在教育子女方面的苦恼，但他们的聪明之处在于：不勉强子女，善于启发，善于诱导，善于发现孩子最佳或较佳才能的生长点，这才称得上真正的爱子之心。
    家书何以抵万金，人间最贵是真情。
