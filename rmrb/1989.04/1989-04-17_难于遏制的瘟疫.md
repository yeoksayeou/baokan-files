Title: An Uncontrollable Plague

The American media has likened drug abuse and trafficking to a plague. This plague is currently spreading rapidly in the United States. The number of drug users is increasing daily, the scope of its harm is extensive, and even drug-related murders and incidents frequently occur right under the noses of the U.S. Congress and the White House, making it difficult for the authorities to manage.

The spread of drugs is a product of the pathological psychology and economic ailments of Western society. Drug abuse is closely linked to the remaining poverty in Western society. Some people, having hit rock bottom, turn to drugs to ease their troubles, only to end up deeper in debt. As a result, drug abuse becomes a catalyst for evil phenomena such as murder, robbery, and prostitution. These phenomena intertwine and mutually reinforce each other, creating a vicious cycle.

To be fair, the American public is not indifferent to the spread of drugs; the U.S. government's efforts to combat drugs cannot be said to be lacking in effort. On April 10, the newly appointed U.S. anti-drug czar Bennett announced an $80 million anti-drug plan, aiming to start with Washington. The measures include increasing funding, building new prisons, utilizing the intelligence capabilities of the Department of Defense, and deploying experts from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. However, the results are disappointing. Even federal government officials do not fully believe that nearly $100 million can cure a major affliction of American society, because the root cause of drug proliferation in the United States is not a lack of government anti-drug funding. Treating the symptoms without addressing the root cause can at best only alleviate the condition slightly and is far from eradicating it.

　　难于遏制的瘟疫
　　张允文
    美国舆论把吸毒、贩毒比之为瘟疫。这场瘟疫目前在美国呈蔓延之势。吸毒人数日增，流毒范围广泛，与毒品交易和毒品有关的凶杀事件甚至频频发生于美国国会和白宫的鼻子底下，令当局很难收拾。
    毒品泛滥是西方社会病态心理和经济病症的混合产物。吸毒与西方社会尚有的贫困现象密不可分，一些人穷途潦倒，借毒解愁，结果越吸越穷。因此，吸毒成为凶杀、抢劫、卖淫等邪恶现象的一个诱因。这些现象交织在一起，又相互作用，形成恶性循环。
    平心而论，美国公众对毒品泛滥不可谓不深恶痛绝，美国政府为反毒也不能说不竭尽全力。４月１０日，新上任的美国扫毒总管贝内特又宣布了一项拨款８０００万美元的扫毒计划，要拿华盛顿开第一刀。办法不外乎增加经费，修建新的监狱，动用国防部的情报力量和联邦调查局的专家。但收效呢，又不能不令人失望。连联邦政府的官员也不大相信，近亿美元能治愈美国社会的一大痼疾，因为毒品在美国泛滥的根源并非政府反毒经费不足。治标不治本，充其量只能缓解一下病情，实难断根。
