The annual selection of the "Flying Apsaras Award" for outstanding TV dramas is about to begin. As people reflect on the TV dramas created in the past year, they noticeably feel that TV dramas are getting longer. There are many excellent serial dramas that can be listed, but excellent single-episode dramas are almost as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, with only a few highly acclaimed works like "White Mountain Ridge," "Paper Boat," and "Cloud and Mist."

However, audiences are eagerly awaiting more excellent single-episode dramas. It is undeniable that serial dramas have their own advantages. Excellent serial dramas leave a deep and unforgettable impression on viewers. But for many viewers, due to busy work schedules and the fast pace of life, they cannot watch every episode without missing any, which is also a pity. Therefore, enjoying a concise and powerful excellent TV drama in a relatively concentrated time is indeed a unique aesthetic experience.

Now, the question is: Why are TV dramas getting longer? Why are there fewer excellent single-episode dramas?

I think there are many reasons for this. But there are two that can and should be improved immediately. The first is the current TV drama script compensation system. Paying by the episode means the more episodes, the more money. Thus, what could have been wrapped up in two episodes is stretched to four, doubling the compensation. This is how the trend of making dramas longer and more drawn-out starts. This is what we call the stench of money corrupting art! Why can't we change from paying by the episode to paying by quality? The compensation for a two-episode or even a one-episode excellent single-episode drama, such as "The Death of Qiu Bai" and "The Hippocratic Oath," why can't it be higher than that of those mediocre and rough serial dramas of four or even eight episodes? Related to this is the filming investment, which should not be calculated by the number of episodes. According to current practices, each episode gets about 40,000 yuan in filming fees, two episodes double that, and the more episodes, the more investment, which also objectively encourages the trend of making dramas longer. The second is that the "Flying Apsaras Award" and various other awards should focus on encouraging excellent single-episode dramas. Why are there particularly few excellent single-episode dramas in the past year? This is probably related to the previous "Flying Apsaras Award" selection's oversight in discovering and encouraging excellent single-episode dramas. For example, "We Swear" and "Big Street, Small Alley," which have innovations in single-episode formats and TV drama language and are widely acclaimed by audiences, did not make the list. Has this, to some extent, dampened the enthusiasm of those TV artists who are dedicated to single-episode drama creation? And in the "Top Ten TV Directors" selection organized by the "China Radio and Television" magazine, which has a significant impact nationwide, not a single outstanding TV director specializing in single-episode drama creation made it to the list. The impact of this unfair selection on single-episode drama creation is likely to be far from optimistic.

　　电视剧何以越拍越长  单本剧佳作何以越来越少
    呼唤电视单本剧的佳作
    仲呈祥
    一年一度的全国优秀电视剧“飞天奖”评选又要开始了。人们在回顾近一年来屏幕上的电视剧创作时，突出地感到：电视剧越拍越长。电视连续剧的佳作还可以举出一长串，而电视单本剧的佳作几乎凤毛麟角，呼声较高的只有《白色山岗》、《纸船》、《云雾》等屈指可数的几部。
    然而，观众却在期待着更多的优秀单本剧问世。毋庸否认，电视连续剧自有其优势。连续剧佳作给观众留下的印象是深刻的、难忘的。但对不少观众说来，由于公务的繁忙和生活节奏的加快，使他们不能一集不漏地坐在屏幕前欣赏，这又不能不是憾事。因此，在一个相对集中的时间里欣赏完一个短小精悍的电视剧佳作，实在是别有一番滋味的审美享受。
    现在要问：电视剧何以越拍越长？单本剧佳作何以越来越少？
    我想，其间的缘由很多。但有两条，是应当而且可以从眼前就开始着手切实改进的。其一，是现行的电视剧稿酬制度。按集付酬，集数越多钱越多。于是，本来两集打住正好的，设法渗入水分，变成四集，稿酬也就翻了一倍。长风，拖风，就是这么刮起来的。这叫做铜臭锈蚀了艺术！为什么就不能改按集付酬为按质付酬呢？两集甚至一集的优秀单本剧，如《秋白之死》、《希波克拉底誓言》，其稿酬为何不可以比那些四集乃至八集的平庸粗糙的连续剧稿酬更高呢？与此相关的是拍摄投资，也不宜按集论数。按时下行情，一集给拍摄费四万左右，两集就翻倍，集数越多投资费越多，这也客观上刺激了长风。其二，是“飞天奖”和各种评奖应注重鼓励单本剧佳作。为什么近一年的优秀单本剧尤其少？这恐怕与上一届“飞天奖”在评选中对单本剧佳作的发现、鼓励有所失误有关。譬如，在单本剧样式和电视剧语言方面都确有创新的《我们起誓》，在喜剧上确有探索而广大观众又拍手叫好的《大马路小胡同》等佳作，都未能榜上有名。这是否在某种程度上挫伤了那些矢志于单本剧创作的电视艺术家们的积极性？而由《中国广播影视》杂志主办的在全国范围影响颇大的“十佳影视导演”评选中，竟无一名从事单本剧创作的电视剧优秀导演荣登金榜，这种失之公允的评选对单本剧创作产生的影响，恐怕也不会令人乐观。
