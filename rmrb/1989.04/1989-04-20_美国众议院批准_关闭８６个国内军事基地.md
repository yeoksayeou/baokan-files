The U.S. House of Representatives today approved the closure of 86 domestic military bases and the reduction in size of 5 other bases by a vote of 381 to 43. The aim is to cut military expenditure.

The plan to close the bases was proposed by a special committee appointed by the Secretary of Defense. Both former Secretary of Defense Carlucci and the current Secretary of Defense Cheney have endorsed this plan. The committee estimates that closing these bases will save $693 million annually. The closure process will begin on January 1, 1990, and is scheduled to be completed by September 30, 1995.

　　美国众议院批准    
    关闭８６个国内军事基地
    本报华盛顿４月１８日电  记者张启昕报道：美国众议院今天以３８１票对４３票批准关闭８６个美国国内军事基地，并缩小５个基地的规模。目的是削减军费开支。
    关闭基地的计划是由国防部长指定的一个专门委员会提出的。前任国防部长卡卢奇和现任国防部长切尼先后同意了此项计划。委员会估计，关闭这些基地每年可以节省开支６．９３亿美元。关闭工作从１９９０年１月１日开始，到１９９５年９月３０日完成。
