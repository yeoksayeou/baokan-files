　　世界旅游热
    近年来世界旅游业蓬勃发展，到国外旅游的人越来越多。
    据统计，一九八八年全世界旅游人数达三点九亿人次，比一九八七年增长百分之八点七，旅游支出达一千九百五十亿美元。在世界各地区中，欧洲的旅游事业最发达，到欧洲共同体等国家的旅游者达二点四五亿人次，占全世界旅游人数的百分之六十三，比上年增长百分之七，收入达一千三百九十亿美元，占全世界旅游业总收入的百分之七十一。
    世界上旅游业最发达的国家仍然是号称“旅游王国”的西班牙，近年来它的旅游收入一直居世界首位。去年共接待外国旅游者五千四百一十七万人次，相当于本国人口的百分之一百三十多，外汇收入一百六十七点八亿美元，比上年增长百分之十三点七。
    一九八八年到美国旅游的约达三千三百五十万人次，仅次于西班牙和意大利，旅游收入达二百四十八亿美元，居世界第一位。　　亚洲地区的日本、泰国、香港、新加坡等旅游业发展也很快。尤其是泰国的外国游客每年都以百分之二十的速度递增。
    相反，一些老的旅游国近年来很不景气。到瑞士、英国的旅游者连年减少。
