Harbin Cracks Down on Four Gold Smuggling Cases; Some Banks Support Illegal Activities

	The People's Daily, Harbin, April 15—Reporter Wu Peizhen learned from the Economic Investigation Department of the Harbin Public Security Bureau that since this spring, the department has cracked down on four major cases of illegal gold trading, seizing 170.8 kilograms of illegally traded gold, valued at over 20 million yuan.

	Last winter and this spring, banks tightened credit, and many places experienced a shortage of funds. How did some enterprises manage to have such large sums of money to engage in illegal activities? The Economic Investigation Department of the Public Security Bureau told the reporter that there are 14 banks and branches, including the Heilongjiang Provincial Construction Bank, the Harbin Industrial and Commercial Bank, and the Hulan County Industrial and Commercial Bank, that have supported or participated in these illegal and disorderly activities.

	Relevant personnel pointed out that if the illegal and disorderly activities within the banking system are not seriously rectified and necessary supervision is not implemented, the task of rectifying economic order and improving the economic environment will be difficult to accomplish.

　　哈尔滨侦破四起倒卖黄金案
　　银行一些单位竟支持参与违法活动
    本报哈尔滨４月１５日电　记者武培真从哈尔滨市公安局经侦处获悉：今春以来，该局共侦破四起非法倒卖黄金大案，发现非法经营黄金量达１７０．８公斤，价值达２０００多万元。
    去冬今春，银行紧缩银根，各地大多感到资金短缺，一些企业为何却有巨额资金从事非法活动呢？市公安局经侦处告诉记者，有黑龙江省建设银行、哈市工商银行、呼兰县工商银行等１４家银行和办事处，支持或参与了这些违法乱纪活动。
    有关人士指出，对于银行系统的违法乱纪活动，如不进行认真的整顿并进行必要的监督，整顿经济秩序、治理经济环境的任务很难顺利完成。
