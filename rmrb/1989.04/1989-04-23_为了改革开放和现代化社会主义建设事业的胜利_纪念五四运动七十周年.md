The 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement is approaching. Commemorating this event at this moment has special significance.

The May Fourth Movement of 70 years ago was, directly speaking, a movement to resist imperialism's attempt to annihilate China. However, it raised slogans that had a profound and long-lasting impact on the progress of Chinese history: democracy, science, and new culture. The May Fourth Movement was an enlightenment movement for the Chinese nation. The reason why Chinese youth, the Chinese intellectual community, and people from all walks of life in China have long commemorated the May Fourth Movement is that its impact on Chinese history has been so profound, making people feel strongly at any time that commemorating it will provide them with significant education and inspiration, encouraging them to press forward bravely.

In the process of historical progress, there are various kinds of contradictions. People's views on social and political issues in the process of progress will not be completely consistent. Whether the slogans of democracy, science, and new culture are still applicable today, and whether they still need to be emphasized, are issues with different views. As for why they are still applicable, how much they should be emphasized, and which specific contents should be emphasized in combination with reality, different people have different opinions, which is a very natural thing. Therefore, discussions should be carried out to deepen people's understanding. The slogans raised by the May Fourth Movement 70 years ago were gradually internalized by people through long-term, uninterrupted work. Today, when we commemorate the May Fourth Movement, of course, it is not limited to holding meetings and publishing articles on the anniversary. The academic and news communities in China began preparing for the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement in 1989 a year ago. I believe that the commemoration of the May Fourth Movement should "come early" and "go late." After May 4, 1989, we should continue to delve deeper into the issues raised in today's commemoration of the May Fourth Movement.

The slogans of democracy, science, and new culture raised by the May Fourth Movement should be further developed and widely propagated today.

I firmly believe that the slogans of democracy, science, new culture, and enlightenment are not only applicable today but should also be deeply developed and widely propagated in combination with China's current reality. I have two reasons for this view:

First, transforming China from a politically dark, economically poor, and culturally backward semi-colonial, semi-feudal old society to a politically democratic, economically prosperous, and culturally advanced socialist new society is a very arduous task. Seventy years is too short a time to achieve this transformation. Many people (including myself) have underestimated the difficulty of this journey. With the experience of these 70 years, it is now clear: if after the May Fourth Movement we used only 30 years to achieve the victory of the Chinese people in seizing power, this was unexpectedly smooth; then, after the founding of the People's Republic of China, facing the political, economic, and cultural legacies of old China, the time needed to complete the aforementioned transformation will be unexpectedly long. The view that the task of social reform proposed 70 years ago has been thoroughly or largely completed does not conform to China's reality.

Second, the content of the slogans of democracy, science, and new culture is constantly developing, and 70 years later, these slogans have new content.

Regarding democracy. The democracy advocated by the pioneers and active participants of the May Fourth Movement included the old-style democracy practiced in capitalist countries at that time and the proletarian democracy (proletarian dictatorship) established after the October Revolution in Russia. Later, they gradually recognized that in China, a dictatorship of the united front of all revolutionary classes under the leadership of the proletariat should be implemented. Today, it has developed to the democracy enjoyed by socialist members in a socialist society. It is not a class dictatorship because, although class struggle has not been extinguished, there is no political system that excludes certain classes or some classes from enjoying democratic rights as socialist members. As for the deprivation of democratic rights for a certain period or for life due to criminal offenses, this does not fall under the category of class dictatorship. Socialist democracy is the core of China's basic political system. It can be said that such an understanding of democracy is something unknown to the participants of the May Fourth Movement 70 years ago.

Regarding science. I divide science into general science and Marxist science. For general science that can be applied under capitalist systems and also under socialist systems, there has been tremendous progress in these 70 years. The breadth and depth it has reached are unimaginable 70 years ago. For our reform, it is necessary to emphasize the mastery and application of contemporary science and technology to a high degree. The May Fourth Movement promoted the spread of Marxism in China, which is a great achievement of the May Fourth Movement that played a decisive role in China's destiny. Marxism needs to be developed, and this is particularly important for contemporary China. The development of Marxism and the emergence of a group of high-level Marxist theorists are of great significance for China's future. However, today, the development of Marxism in China is insufficient, and within and outside the Party, not only among the youth but also among the middle-aged and the elderly, there is a situation where Marxism is not valued. Today, commemorating the May Fourth Movement, emphasizing the slogan of "science" including Marxist science, should be acknowledged as having new content.

Regarding new culture. Regardless of which definition of culture is used—whether it refers to the sum of all material and spiritual wealth created by humanity, or specifically to spiritual wealth, or it is understood as social ideology and the various activities and organizations that adapt to it, culture always changes with the overall changes in society's economy, politics, and other social factors. China's inherent culture cannot but be influenced by the cultures of other countries in the world, and the relationship between a country's original culture and the imported culture is also complex. The two cultures can merge, conflict, or produce new cultural trends after merging. The past 70 years have been a time of great social change in China. The "new culture" advocated by the May Fourth Movement has already brought about great changes in China's culture. In the past decade, although the slogan of new culture has not been strongly advocated during the reform and opening up, China's cultural life has undergone a series of changes. These changes, when viewed individually or in the short term, may seem to be only minor changes, as if only some shifts have occurred. However, when accumulated together, they can be seen to be producing a major change in the entire cultural system. Today, the development of new culture has become a powerful objective trend, especially in regions where the commodity economy has developed. The current problem is the lack of scientific analysis of the ongoing cultural changes, so there is no true scientific guidance; at the same time, there is also a phenomenon of some cultures that hinder social progress and are unwilling to exit the historical stage. Therefore, overcoming cultural conservatism and developing a new culture suitable for China's modernization of socialist construction has become an important issue. The new culture mentioned here involves a very broad field. In terms of cultural content, it includes science, art, technology, and skills; in terms of tools and institutions for the dissemination of new culture, it includes education, news, publishing, broadcasting, television, various forms of art dissemination, libraries, museums, etc. All of these need to be vigorously developed.

From the above two aspects, it can be said that the slogans of democracy, science, and new culture are completely applicable today.

Here, it is necessary to specifically discuss the issue of enlightenment.

The May Fourth Movement 70 years ago, as an enlightenment movement, had the following two characteristics. First, the Xinhai Revolution, which overthrew the Qing Dynasty, had only been eight years, and the power of feudal warlords and bureaucrats and feudal ethics was strong. The degree of ignorance and backwardness among the people was, of course, much more serious than it is today. The May Fourth Movement was an enlightenment movement aimed at this situation. Second, the failure of the old democratic revolution had already become apparent, and China's progress required a transition from a democratic revolution to a new democratic revolution. The October Revolution in Russia achieved victory, and Li Dazhao and others introduced Marxism to China, expanding a new horizon for China's intellectual community. Advanced intellectuals spread Marxism to advanced workers, giving birth to the Communist Party of China. This was another significant enlightenment of the May Fourth Movement.

Seventy years have passed. Now China has entered the primary stage of socialism. Our goal is to build China into a modernized socialist power. To complete this great historical task, we need new knowledge that matches this task. However, in this regard, we are still lacking. As pointed out in the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 12th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held in October 1984 on economic system reform: "In the face of the new tasks of the new era, whether old, middle-aged, or young cadres, in general, all lack the new knowledge and experience needed for modernization construction, and all need to re-recognize themselves and re-learn." We not only need new knowledge that meets the requirements of modernization but, more importantly, we need new ideas and concepts that meet the requirements of modernization. Therefore, we now need a new enlightenment. We have every reason to expect that after this commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, a new enlightenment aimed at promoting the modernization of socialist construction will emerge.

The slogans of democracy, science, and new culture should serve the reform, opening up, and modernization of socialist construction today.

Democracy, science, and new culture are the fundamental slogans of the May Fourth Movement 70 years ago. Now, our country is carrying out reform, opening up, and modernization of socialist construction. Regarding the relationship between democracy, science, new culture, and reform, opening up, and modernization of socialist construction, I would like to say two sentences: democracy, science, and new culture are the political, ideological, and cultural foundations of reform and opening up and modernization of socialist construction, while reform and opening up and modernization of socialist construction are the objects that contemporary Chinese democracy, science, and new culture should serve.

Commemorating the past is always for better solving current problems, so when commemorating the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, we must, of course, understand what are the main problems that need to be solved in China today. I believe that what China needs to emphasize today is to adhere to reform, adhere to opening up, and adhere to the spirit of actively advancing the modernization of socialist construction. Among these, adhering to reform is particularly important because reform is the only way to revitalize China and ensure the success of the modernization of socialist construction. If we do not continue to carry out reforms and carry out this reform to the end, China's economy and culture will not be able to develop smoothly. This is not an imagined doctrine; it is a scientific conclusion drawn from the experience of the more than 30 years since China entered the primary stage of socialism in 1956. Assuming that the reform has really stopped or even regressed, then the vitality brought by the reform will be lost, and China's socialism will long remain in the state of a "poor society." As a result, China's position in the world will be reduced, and as Deng Xiaoping said, China will then have the danger of being expelled from the game.

Adhering to reform, adhering to opening up, and adhering to the spirit of actively advancing the modernization of socialist construction requires democracy. Reform requires democracy because only the combination of top-down and bottom-up can achieve the desired results of reform. Without top-down support (political support) and theoretical guidance for reform, reform will be suppressed or lose direction. Without strong bottom-up demands and proactive, creative actions, reform will lack momentum and the main force to promote reform. Opening up requires democracy because it is unimaginable that opening up can be smooth sailing. It is necessary to guarantee socialist democratic rights so that the opening-up policy can be understood, and the broad masses of the people can realize that this policy will bring great benefits to our country, and reform can be strongly implemented. As for the cause of modernizing socialist construction, it is even more inseparable from the broad socialist members' democracy because only when they feel that they are indeed enjoying democratic rights can they fully exert their initiative. We can and should achieve the highest possible level of democracy. The democracy of the primary stage of socialism may be somewhat lower due to economic and cultural reasons compared to the higher stage of socialism, but it should be a high level of democracy compared to the little people's democracy in capitalist society. This should be clear in the guiding ideology. At the same time, various strata (temporarily using the term "strata") of socialist members should strive for the highest possible democratic goals, in addition to the commonalities among the strata, should also consider the characteristics of their own strata, and the goals and methods should be as clear and specific as possible to achieve the best results.

Adhering to reform, adhering to opening up, and adhering to the spirit of actively advancing the modernization of socialist construction requires science. Here, science includes both scientific knowledge and scientific spirit. It should be admitted that although we have emphasized the importance of scientific knowledge to a high degree in documents, we have not yet achieved this in actual life. I believe that the current problem is not to find language that gives a higher evaluation of the position and role of scientific knowledge but to have practical and effective measures, such as giving those who have more scientific knowledge a higher position and material treatment. However, the current situation in China is not completely like this. The occurrence of this situation has some that the state cannot control, which is not discussed here. But in terms of the policies and measures stipulated by the state itself, it has not yet been able to show sufficient attention to scientific knowledge and those who have more scientific knowledge. This is the reason why the scientific community and even the intellectual community have expressed strong dissatisfaction in various occasions.

Commemorating the May Fourth Movement should especially emphasize the advocacy of the scientific spirit, which is the spirit of seeking truth from facts.

As for the scientific spirit, it has been rarely mentioned in recent years, and this matter that should be especially emphasized has been neglected. I believe that this should also be especially emphasized when commemorating the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement today.

People can cite many facts about the lack of emphasis on the scientific spirit in China today. In summary, I believe the following points should be noted. First, in propaganda and education, there are more articles in newspapers and publications that emphasize the importance of scientific knowledge, but there are few articles that highlight the scientific spirit. In schools, the education of the scientific spirit is also not emphasized, and in practice, it is only the work of imparting knowledge. Second, in the scientific decision-making process, although it has begun to be emphasized, the requirement for all our work to be firmly based on science is not high, and the system is not perfect. There are successful experiences in this regard, but there are also many lessons. Third, it should be pointed out that in scientific research work (I mainly refer to social science research), there is often a lack of necessary rigorous scientific spirit. Some views, even those that have a significant impact on actual work, cannot withstand the test of whether they conform to the scientific spirit. The confusion of some concepts used by the scientific community is also a problem that deserves attention. Fourth, some anti-scientific spirit propaganda that fundamentally opposes the scientific spirit has reached an unbearable degree. In short, whether from a principled point of view or in view of China's current situation, when commemorating the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, we should emphasize the advocacy of the scientific spirit, in order to start strengthening the education and propaganda of the scientific spirit from now on.

To advocate the scientific spirit, there is a prerequisite, that is, at least subjectively require oneself to be correct when looking at and handling problems, and have the desire to seek truth. If there is not even such a desire, of course, there is no basis for advocating the scientific spirit. However, subjectively requiring correctness does not mean being able to correctly look at problems. The proposal of the scientific spirit is to achieve correct cognition. To advocate the scientific spirit, of course, one must understand what the scientific spirit is. I believe that the scientific spirit, after all, is the spirit of materialism, that is, the spirit of seeking truth from facts that the Party Central Committee and Deng Xiaoping have repeatedly emphasized. However, to advocate the scientific spirit, we must make our cognition concrete, and we must discuss and depict the specific manifestations of the scientific spirit, so as to concretely solve problems.

The work of concretizing the scientific spirit should be carried out in combination with China's current reality. Violating the scientific spirit and adhering to the scientific spirit have general epistemological reasons unrelated to social factors, as well as social reasons. Specifically studying this problem should also consider these two aspects. Blindness and the scientific spirit are opposed, and blindness has many forms, such as blindly following authority, blindly following popular and fashionable views, or believing in the philosophy of "power is truth." Here, social factors play an important role. Self-interest considerations often obscure the truth or even violate the scientific spirit to fabricate arguments for one's own interests. To adhere to the scientific spirit, one should strive to eliminate these social factors that hinder the recognition of truth. As for the lack of recognition of objective laws that do not change with human will, making oneself unable to completely eliminate subjective idealism (voluntarism is a manifestation of subjective idealism), or not doing detailed investigations, making judgments without sufficient objective basis, not being willing to seriously analyze specific things concretely, and abstractly understanding problems, etc., it is mainly due to the lack of deep understanding and training of the spirit of materialism and the scientific spirit. Of course, there is also a problem of laziness in thinking. Science is honest learning. Dealing with things according to the scientific spirit, when it is necessary to work hard and exert effort, one must work hard and exert effort. Otherwise, one will not get scientific results. There are still many manifestations of the lack of scientific spirit, which are not listed here one by one. Exposing the manifestations of the lack of scientific spirit and conducting discussions is itself an important task in commemorating the May Fourth Movement.

Reform, opening up, and modernization of socialist construction are comprehensive, and the new culture and new concepts they need are also comprehensive.

Adhering to reform, adhering to opening up, and adhering to the spirit of actively advancing the modernization of socialist construction requires new culture and cultural enlightenment.

An important content of reform, opening up, and modernization of socialist construction is to eliminate the old and establish the new, which naturally requires new concepts and new culture to serve it. Since reform, opening up, and modernization of socialist construction are things that need to be done in various fields, they are comprehensive, so the new concepts and new culture they need are also comprehensive. It involves fields from daily material life to economy, politics, and various social relations and social life. They require new culture, which, in terms of content, includes science, art, technology, skills, etc.; in terms of dissemination tools, it includes education, news, publishing, television, radio, libraries, museums, and various forms of art, etc. At the same time, since there will inevitably be various different views in the process of reform, opening up, and modernization of socialist construction, there will inevitably be various kinds of contradictions and struggles in the issue of updating concepts and cultural enlightenment. The significance of updating concepts and cultural enlightenment for reform, opening up, and modernization of socialist construction is precisely here. The 18th-century French enlightenment scholars proposed that the encyclopedia they edited, which is world-famous and has historical significance, is "not a warehouse but an arsenal," indicating that their cause is combative.

The new culture and new enlightenment we are talking about here not only have a clear purpose—to serve the cause of reform, opening up, and modernization of socialist construction—but also their nature is socialist. Of course, this culture must also be democratic and scientific. The new culture we need is a democratic culture because it requires socialist members to discuss themselves, recognize themselves in the discussion, and gain further development. This culture is a scientific culture, of course, not saying that this new culture only includes this form of scientific culture. It also includes art and other cultural forms. Here, it only means that this new culture is formed and developed under the guidance of science, especially under the guidance of Marxist science. Of course, new culture must inherit the cultural heritage created by predecessors that still has positive significance today and develop it in practice.

　　为了改革开放和现代化社会主义建设事业的胜利    
    ——纪念五四运动七十周年
    于光远
    五四运动七十周年纪念日即将来临。在今天这样的时刻进行这个纪念，有特别重要的意义。
    七十年前的“五四”，直接地说，是反对帝国主义企图灭亡中国的救亡运动。然而它提出了对于推动中国历史前进的、长期发生作用的带根本性的口号：民主、科学与新文化。五四运动对于我们中华民族来说，是一个启蒙运动。中国青年、中国知识界乃至中国各界人士之所以长期纪念“五四”，就是因为它对中国历史发生的作用是如此深远，使得人们在任何时候都会强烈地感到，对它的纪念会给自己以重大的教育和启发，激励着自己奋勇前进。
    在历史前进的过程中，充满着各色各样的矛盾。人们对前进中社会政治问题的看法也是不会完全一致的。民主、科学、新文化的口号，在今天是否仍然适用、是否仍然需要强调，就是有不同看法的问题之一。至于为什么仍然适用，应该强调到什么程度，结合实际应该强调哪一些内容，不同的人有不同的说法更是很自然的事情。因此就应该展开讨论，使人们的认识逐渐深刻起来。当年五四运动提出的口号，就是经过长期不断的工作一步一步地深入人心的。今天我们纪念“五四”，当然也不限于在纪念日开一些会议、发表一些文章。我国学术界和新闻界在一年前就已经着手准备１９８９年的五四运动七十周年纪念。我认为，纪念“五四”应该“来得早”，也“去得迟”，在１９８９年５月４日过去之后，还要把今天纪念“五四”中提出的问题深入下去。
    “五四”提出的民主、科学和新文化的口号，今天还应该深入发展和普遍宣传。
    我是坚决认为，民主、科学、新文化和启蒙的口号，在今天不但适用，而且应该结合中国当前实际作深入的发展和普遍的宣传。我这样主张有两点理由：
    一、从政治黑暗、经济贫困、文化落后的殖民地半殖民地半封建的旧中国，到政治民主、经济繁荣、文化发达的社会主义的新中国，是一个十分艰巨的任务。七十年的时间，对于实现这个转变是太短了。过去不少人（我自己也在内）把走完这个历程看得太容易了。有了这七十年的历史，现在看得很清楚：如果“五四”之后我们只用了三十年的时间就取得了中国人民夺取政权的胜利，是出乎许多人意料之外的顺利的话；那么，在中华人民共和国诞生之后，面对着旧中国的政治、经济和文化遗产，要完成上述那个转变所需要的时间就会出乎许多人意料之外地长；认为七十年前提出的社会改革的任务已经彻底或者已经相当彻底地完成的看法，是不符合中国现实的。
    二、民主、科学和新文化这些口号的内容是不断发展的，七十年后这些口号已经有了崭新的内容。
    关于民主。五四运动的先驱者以及积极参加者们讲的民主，有的是当时资本主义国家中实行的旧式的民主，有的是俄国十月革命后建立起来的无产阶级民主（即无产阶级专政），以后又逐渐认识到在中国要实行无产阶级领导下各革命阶级的联合专政，到今天则发展到社会主义成员享受民主权利的社会主义民主。它不是阶级专政，因为阶级斗争虽然尚未熄灭，但是不再存在需要将某个或某些阶级排除在能够享受民主权利的社会主义成员之外的政治制度。至于因为犯罪依法定期剥夺或终身剥夺其民主权利，不属于阶级专政的范畴。社会主义民主是我国社会主义基本政治制度的核心。应该说，这样理解的民主，是七十年前的五四运动参加者所不知道的。
    关于科学。我把科学分为一般科学和马克思主义的科学。对于在资本主义制度下可以运用、在社会主义制度下也可以运用的一般科学，在这七十年中突飞猛进。它所达到的广度和深度，是七十年前的人想象不出来的。为了我们的改革，有高度强调掌握和运用当代科学技术的必要。五四运动促使马克思主义在中国得到有力的传播，这是五四运动的一个伟大的、对于中国之命运起了决定性作用的成果。马克思主义需要发展，这一点对于当代中国尤其重要。发展马克思主义，出现一批高水平的马克思主义理论家，对今后中国之命运关系极大。但是，当今我国马克思主义发展不足，而在党内外，不仅在青年中，而且在中年和老年中，都存在一种不重视马克思主义的情况。今天纪念“五四”，强调包括马克思主义科学在内的“科学”这个口号，应该承认是有新的内容的。
    关于新文化。不论对文化采用哪一种定义——泛指人类创造的物质财富和精神财富的总和或特指精神财富，或理解为社会意识形态以及与此相适应的种种活动和组织，文化总是随着整个社会经济政治和其他社会因素的变化而变化的。中国的固有的文化也不能不受到世界上其他国家文化的影响，而且一国原来的文化与传入的文化之间的关系也是复杂的，两种文化之间汇合后可以产生融合、对抗或者产生新的文化趋向等情况。以往七十年是中国社会巨大变革的时代。五四运动号召的“新文化”，已经使中国在文化上发生了很大的变化。近十年来实行改革开放，虽然没有强调提出新文化的口号，但是中国的文化生活已经发生了一系列的变化。这些变化单独地看或者短期来看也许可以看作只是小变化，似乎只是发生某种飘移，但是积累在一起就可以看出正在产生整个文化系统的大变化。在今天，新文化的发展已经成为一个强有力的客观趋势。这在商品经济发展起来的地区尤其如此。现在的问题是对正在发生的文化变化趋势缺少科学分析，因此也谈不到真正科学的引导；同时，也有一种阻碍社会进步的文化不肯退出历史舞台的现象。因此，克服文化保守主义，发展适合于我国现代化社会主义建设事业的新文化，就成为当前一个重要课题。这里说的新文化涉及的领域是很广泛的。就文化的内容来说是科学、艺术、技术与技巧，就新文化传播工具和机构来说则有教育、新闻、出版、广播、电视、各种艺术形式的传播工具、图书馆、博物馆……它们都需要大力发展。
    从以上两个方面来说，在今天，民主、科学和新文化的口号，应该说是完全适用的。
    在这里还有必要专门讲一下启蒙的问题。
    七十年前的“五四”作为启蒙运动，具有这样两个特点。第一，那时推翻满清政府的辛亥革命才只有八年，封建军阀官僚和封建礼教的势力很强，居民中愚昧和落后的程度当然比现在要严重得多，“五四”就是针对这种情况而言的启蒙。第二，那时旧民主主义革命的失败已经显现出来，中国的进步要求从民主主义革命转向新民主主义革命，而俄国十月革命取得了胜利，李大钊等把马克思主义介绍到中国，为中国思想界扩展了一个新的视野。先进的知识分子向先进的工人传播马克思主义，产生了中国共产党。这是五四运动另一个意义的启蒙。
    七十年的时间过去了。现在中国进入了社会主义的初级阶段。我们的目标是把我国建设成为现代化的社会主义强国。为了完成这个伟大的历史任务，需要有能够和这个任务相适应的新知识。但是在这方面还很欠缺。正如１９８４年１０月举行的中国共产党十二届三中全会关于经济体制改革的决定中指出的那样：“在新时期的崭新任务面前，不论老中青干部，总的来说都缺乏现代化建设所需要的新知识新经验，都要重新认识自己，都要重新学习。”我们不仅要有适合现代化要求的新知识，更为重要的是还要有适合于现代化要求的新思想、新观念。因此，现在我们需要一个新的启蒙。我们完全有理由期待在这次纪念“五四”七十周年后，兴起一个旨在促进现代化社会主义建设的新启蒙。
    民主、科学和新文化的口号，在今天要为改革开放和现代化社会主义建设服务。
    民主、科学和新文化是七十年前五四运动的根本口号。现在我国正在进行的是改革、开放和现代化社会主义建设。对民主、科学、新文化和改革、开放、现代化社会主义建设之间的关系，我想说这样两句话：民主、科学、新文化是改革开放和现代化社会主义建设的政治的、思想的和文化的基础，而改革开放和现代化社会主义建设，则是在当代中国民主、科学、新文化要为之服务的对象。
    纪念过去总是为了更好地解决当前的问题，因此在纪念五四运动七十周年的时候，当然必须了解当前我国需要解决的主要问题是什么。我认为，当前我国需要特别强调的是坚持改革，坚持开放，坚持以积极进取的精神来进行现代化的社会主义建设。其中尤其以坚持改革这一条更是重要，因为改革是振兴中华，使现代化社会主义建设得以成功的唯一出路。如果不继续进行改革，不把这一场改革进行到底，我国的经济文化是不可能顺利地向前发展的。而这一点并不是什么臆想出来的道理，它是总结了１９５６年我国进入社会主义初级阶段以来三十多年的经验得出的科学结论。假定真的改革停止了甚至倒退了，那么由于改革而带来的那些活力就会丧失，我国的社会主义将长期处在“贫穷的社会”的境地，结果我国在世界各国中的地位还会降低，用邓小平的话来说，那时中国有被开除球籍的危险。
    坚持改革、坚持开放、坚持以积极进取的精神进行现代化的社会主义建设需要民主。改革需要民主，这是因为只有从上而下和从下而上的结合，改革才能取得应有的成果。没有从上而下地为改革开绿灯（即政治上的支持）和理论上的指导，改革就会受压抑或者迷失方向。没有自下而上的强烈要求和主动的创造性的行动，改革就没有动力，缺少推进改革的主体力量。开放需要民主是因为不能设想实行开放能够一帆风顺，一定要保障社会主义民主权利，开放政策才能得到理解，广大人民认识到这个政策会给我们国家带来重大利益，改革才能够有力地贯彻。至于现代化社会主义建设事业更离不开广大社会主义社会成员的民主，因为只有当他们自己感觉到自己是的确在享有民主权利的时候，他们才能充分地发扬自己的积极性。我们可以做到也应该做到尽可能高度的民主。社会主义初级阶段的民主比起社会主义的更高的阶段的民主，可能会因为经济的与文化的原因要低一些，但是比起资本主义社会中的那一点人民民主来说应该是高度的。这一点在指导思想上应该明确。同时社会主义成员中各个阶层（姑且用阶层这个名称）争取尽可能高的民主目标，除了各阶层有共同之处外，还应该考虑本阶层的特点，目标和方法、手段要尽可能明确具体，这样才能收到最好的效果。
    坚持改革、坚持开放、坚持以积极进取精神进行现代化社会主义建设需要科学。这里说的科学，既包括科学知识也包括科学精神。应该承认，现在我们在文件上虽然把科学知识的重要性提到很高的程度，但是在实际生活中还没有做到这一点。我认为，现在的问题不是去寻找什么对科学知识的地位和作用作出更高评价的语言，而是要有切实有效的措施，如让掌握有比较多的科学知识的人获得应有的比较高的地位和物质待遇。但是今天我国的事实还不完全是这样。这种情况的发生，有的不是国家所能控制的，对此姑且不论。但就以国家本身规定的政策和措施而言，也还没有能表现出对科学知识和具有较多科学知识的人的足够重视。这就是科学界乃至知识界在各种场合表示出强烈不满的原因。
    纪念“五四”要特别强调提倡科学精神，也就是实事求是的精神。
    至于科学精神，几年来几乎很少讲到，对这个本来应该特别强调的事情，很不重视。这一点在今天纪念“五四”七十周年的时候，我认为也是应该特别重视的。
    关于今天我国对科学精神重视不够，人们可以举出许多事实来。概括起来，我认为应该指出这样几个方面。首先是在宣传和教育方面，在报刊及出版物中讲要重视科学知识的比较多，突出宣传科学精神的文章很少。在学校中也不重视科学精神的教育，实践中表现为只做传授知识的工作。其次在决策科学化方面，虽然已经开始重视了，但对我们的各项工作都应该牢固地建立在科学的基础上的要求不高，制度也不完备，在这方面有成功的经验，也还有不少教训。第三，应该指出在科学研究工作中（我主要指的是在社会科学研究中），本身也常常缺乏必要的严格的科学精神。有一些见解，甚至对实际工作发生重大影响的见解，就经不起是否符合科学精神的检验。科学界使用的有些概念混乱也是值得重视的一个问题。第四，对某些从根本上反对科学精神的伪科学宣传，有的达到令人难以忍受的程度。总之，不论从原则上或是针对我国目前情况来说，在纪念“五四”七十周年的时候，我们应该大讲特讲提倡科学精神这一条，以期从此开始加强科学精神的教育和宣传。
    讲求科学精神有一个前提，就是至少在主观上要求自己在看问题和处理问题时是正确的，要有寻求真理的愿望。如果连这样的愿望都没有，当然就没有讲求科学精神的基础。然而主观上要求正确并不等于能够做到正确地看问题。科学精神问题的提出，就是要达到正确的认识。要讲求科学精神，当然要理解什么是科学精神。我认为，科学精神说到底就是唯物主义精神，也就是党中央和邓小平反复强调的实事求是的精神。但是要讲求科学精神，就要使我们的认识具体化，要对科学精神的具体表现有所论述和描绘，这样才能具体地解决问题。
    对科学精神如何具体化的工作，应该结合中国当前的实际来进行。违反科学精神和坚持科学精神，有与社会因素无关的一般的认识论上的原因，同时又有社会的原因，具体研究这个问题，也要从这两个方面来考虑。盲从与科学精神是对立的，而盲从就有盲从权威、盲从流行观点、时髦观点，或者信奉“权力即真理”的哲学等许多形式。这里，社会的原因就起着重要的作用。私利的考虑，也常常是遮住真理之所在，甚至违反科学精神去臆造为自己利益辩护的道理。为了坚持科学精神，就应该努力排除这些妨碍自己认识真理的社会因素。至于对存在着不以人的意志为转移的客观规律缺乏认识，使自己不能完全排除主观唯心主义的思想方法（唯意志论是主观唯心主义的一种表现），或者不去做细致的调查研究，随随便便作出缺乏充分客观根据的判断，不愿意认真对具体事物做具体分析，而笼统地抽象地认识问题等等，则主要是对唯物主义精神缺乏深切的认识和缺乏科学精神的锻炼。当然在这里还有一个思想懒惰的问题。科学是老实学。按照科学精神办事，该下功夫该花力气的时候就得下功夫，花力气。否则是得不到合乎科学的结果的成果的。缺乏科学精神的表现还有不少，不在这里一一列举。揭示缺乏科学精神的表现，并且进行讨论，本身就是纪念“五四”的一项重要工作。
    改革开放和现代化社会主义建设是全方位的，它所需要的新文化、新观念也是全方位的。
    坚持改革、坚持开放、坚持以积极进取精神来从事现代化社会主义建设，需要新文化和文化启蒙。
    改革开放和现代化社会主义建设的一个重要内容是除旧布新，理所当然地要求新观念、新文化为自己服务。由于改革、开放和现代化社会主义建设都是在各个领域中要做的事情，它们是全方位的，因此它所需要的新观念、新文化也是全方位的。它涉及的领域从日常的物质生活到经济、政治以及各种社会关系和社会生活。它们要求新文化，从内容方面说，包括科学、艺术、技术、技巧等；从传播工具方面说，包括教育、新闻、出版、电视、广播，图书馆、博物馆以及各种艺术形式等。同时由于在改革、开放和现代化社会主义建设中必然存在各种不同的看法，因此在观念更新和文化启蒙这个问题上也就必然存在着各式各样的矛盾和斗争。观念更新、文化启蒙为改革开放和现代化社会主义建设开路的意义也正在这里。十八世纪法国启蒙学者就对自己编辑的那部世界闻名的、具有历史意义的百科全书，提出“不是仓库而是兵工厂”的要求，说明他们从事的事业是战斗性的。
    我们这里说的新文化和新启蒙不但目的明确——为了改革、开放和现代化社会主义建设事业，而且它的性质也是社会主义的。当然这种文化也必然是民主的和科学的。我们需要的新文化是民主的文化，是因为它要求社会主义成员讨论自己，在讨论中认可自己，使自己获得进一步发展。这种文化是科学的文化，当然不是说这种新文化只包括科学这一种文化形态，它还包括艺术及其它文化形态，这里只是指这种新文化是在科学的指导下，特别是在马克思主义科学的指导下形成和发展起来的。当然，新文化必然要继承前人创造的至今还有积极意义的文化遗产，并在实践中使之发扬光大。
