For a period of time, criminals have been roaming and causing trouble on passenger trains, frequently committing knife-wielding robberies and pickpocketing incidents. Facing criminals who endanger the safety of passengers and their property, the railway public security authorities have increased patrols and severely cracked down on lawless elements, eliminating harm for the people.

Trains Running with Injuries

Among those traveling, the number of passengers taking trains is far greater than those taking other means of transportation. While people complain about the overloaded passenger trains, they also frequently voice complaints about railway security.

On January 13th, the 152nd passenger train from Guangdong's Zhanjiang to Hubei's Wuhan, when it reached Lengshuitan Station, more than 20 criminals swarmed aboard. They were armed with daggers and other weapons, forcibly searching passengers and robbing 8 of them, totaling over 10,000 yuan. Five passengers who resisted were injured. The police on the train immediately caught the criminals upon hearing the news.

On February 15th, on the 381st passenger train from Guiyang to Chongqing, 6 armed criminals robbed a passenger of 170 yuan in cash, then smashed the car window and threw the passenger off the moving train, causing severe injuries.

According to statistics from the Ministry of Railways Public Security Bureau, in the first quarter of this year, the national railway system reported 4,908 criminal cases, an increase of 87.4% compared to the same period last year; among them, 1,605 were major and serious cases, an increase of 152.2% compared to the same period last year.

The primary criminal intent of lawless elements is to steal large sums of money from some passengers. On the night of January 21st, on the 208th passenger train from Heilongjiang's Sanjiazi Station to Liaoning's Dalian, when it was about to reach Dashiqiao Station, businessmen Chui Shengjun and Qi Dongfeng from Harbin's Huachang Motorcycle Shop were awakened by the sound of their luggage being moved. They found that a suitcase containing 80,000 yuan had been stolen. They immediately reported it to the police on the train. After an investigation, the police quickly caught two suspects. One of the suspects was Yang Feng, a stoker from the Changchun Railway Bureau's Changchun Locomotive Section, and the other, Zhao Bing, was an unemployed person from Changchun City.

According to statistics, last year, there were 7,909 cases of passenger property theft on national railways, accounting for 41.5% of all cases. Among them, 68 major cases involved Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan compatriots, and foreign passengers, seriously affecting China's railway reputation.

It is worth noting that some theft suspects often bribe train crew members to facilitate their criminal activities. Some even collude with individual train crew members. Some robbery and theft gangs are composed of railway workers' children and relatives.

Hoping for Railway Guards

Currently, passenger trains are severely overloaded, and both inside and outside the stations, as well as on and off the trains, are extremely crowded. It is said that Beijing Railway Station handles 240,000 to 250,000 passengers daily, plus an additional 300,000 people for transfers, sending off, and picking up passengers.

Among the 50 million mobile population nationwide, the vast majority rely on trains for travel.

After the Spring Festival, on the Jingguang and Xiangui lines, some farmers and rice merchants carried large quantities of rice onto the trains. Some carried tens of thousands of pounds of rice at a time. They hired people to carry the rice onto the trains, and once the train arrived at the station, they would rush aboard, blocking the doors and passages. When the police and train crew members tried to stop them, they ignored them, and some even caused trouble, seriously disrupting the normal order of the trains.

Last year, the national railway public security authorities arrested more than 20,000 criminals, including 10,600 who were either roaming criminals or repeat offenders. In the first quarter of this year, the Beijing Railway Public Security Bureau dealt with 361 criminals, 50% of whom were roaming criminals.

A hard-seat car designed for 128 people often crams in 250 to 260, with trains overloaded by 100% being quite common. The crowded carriages provide more opportunities for thieves.

Previously, each passenger train had 10 to 12 carriages, but now it often adds to 18 to 20. A passenger train increases by a few thousand people, but the number of police on the train does not increase much. It often takes police two to three hours to patrol from the front to the back of the train.

In the fight against criminals endangering passenger trains, the police on the trains have shown the noble qualities and heroic spirit of people's guards by maintaining the safety of passengers' lives and property.

On the night of March 20th, at 12 o'clock, on the 258th train from Changsha to Zhengzhou, when it stopped at Xiaogan Station, police officer Wu Jianxin discovered 12 suspicious individuals with Northeastern accents in Car 10. He went to check their tickets with the train conductor and another police officer.

When checking the first person's ticket, he found that the person had a dagger tucked in their waist. After confiscating the weapon and taking the person to the dining car for questioning, the other 11 accomplices drew their daggers and attacked the police. Seeing that the police could not shoot inside the car, the criminals madly stabbed the police officer.

Facing the threat to the safety of passenger trains, there are countless heroic deeds of police fighting against criminals and cracking down on crimes.

On the morning of February 1st at 5 o'clock, on the 507th train, near Xinxiang Station, a group of criminals stole a farmer's wallet and were discovered. They used a dagger to stab the victim. Police officer Niu Guangyu blocked two criminals in Car 12 and immediately subdued one. When the police were about to subdue the other criminal, four accomplices rushed from the rear of the train, one of whom held a spring knife to Niu Guangyu's neck.

Niu Guangyu immediately fired a warning shot at the ceiling, causing the criminals to withdraw their knives. Another criminal attempted to seize the gun, but failed against the brave and calm police officer. Niu Guangyu used his gun to block the six criminals in the windshield of Car 10. When the train arrived at Xinxiang Station, he cleverly broke the door glass and fired a warning shot.

At this time, the criminals opened another door attempting to jump off the train to escape. The station police heard the gunshot and arrived in time, catching two criminals on the spot.

According to statistics from the Ministry of Railways Public Security Bureau, last year, 5 police officers died and 343 were injured in the fight against criminals. In the first quarter of this year, two more police officers died on the front lines of cracking down on crimes. They contributed their precious lives to railway security and the safety of the people.

Relevant officials believe that with the implementation of the responsibility system, the railway security issue faces the transition from the old to the new system, requiring the cooperation of local governments along the line and various railway departments. In addition, the public security authorities lack manpower. The more than 50,000 railway public security officers are distributed along the 100,000-li railway lines, making it difficult to adapt to the increasing railway transportation tasks and the new situations and changes in security.

Cracking Down on Crimes is Urgent

Facing the severe railway security situation, Minister of Public Security of the Ministry of Railways, Yue Fangzhen, told reporters excitedly, "As a public security organ, maintaining order is our duty. Now we are taking measures to rectify the situation."

Recently, the Shenyang Railway Public Security Bureau has selected 275 high-quality, capable officers to form 46 passenger train security patrol teams. On April 6th, they fully armed and boarded 42 passenger trains under their jurisdiction to conduct inspections and rectifications. In just 5 days, they have solved 9 criminal cases, handled 34 public security cases, and dealt with 157 lawless elements.

In early April, the Shanghai Railway Public Security Bureau, in a unified action to rectify train security, mobilized 300 patrol police, all of whom boarded the trains for patrols. They caught 26 criminals and 111 other lawless elements.

The Urumqi Railway Public Security Bureau, Zhengzhou Railway Public Security Bureau, and other places have also organized forces to form open and undercover teams to enter stations and board trains, concentrating on cracking down on various illegal and criminal activities that disrupt railway security and endanger transportation safety.

The director of the office of the Beijing Railway Public Security Bureau, Sun Baolin, told reporters that the 6 public security bureaus under Beijing have dispatched more than 300 officers to board trains to crack down on roaming criminals and stop illegal and criminal activities.

On the night of April 11th at 10 o'clock, detective Feng Jiling of the Tianjin Railway Bureau found 7 young men with suspicious behavior at Changli Station and approached them for questioning. Seeing the situation, the 7 men drew their daggers and surrounded Feng Jiling, attempting to attack. The detective fired a warning shot, and other officers rushed to the scene, immediately catching all 7 criminals and seizing the weapons.

Minister of Public Security of the Ministry of Railways, Yue Fangzhen, revealed to reporters that the Ministry of Railways Public Security Bureau has deployed various levels of railway public security organs to take strong measures to severely crack down on roaming gang crimes, rectify and manage key sections of railway security, and strive to curb the upward trend of criminal cases in a short period.

It is understood that the Guangzhou Railway Bureau has explored a set of methods to mobilize the masses and implement community-based security measures. Whenever the train enters the Chengyu section where pickpocketing and robbery are rampant, the train conductor would call on the public security, armed police, and PLA officers on the train to take the lead in maintaining order, and the majority of passengers would also actively respond, strongly deterring lawless elements.

Railway security is a systematic project, and people are looking forward to the "engineers" designing effective countermeasures and hoping that the security along the railway lines will improve.

　　面对危害旅客列车的歹徒
    本报记者  毛磊
    一个时期以来，在旅客列车上不法之徒流窜滋扰，持刀抢劫、扒窃财物的事件时有发生。面对危害旅客列车的歹徒，铁路公安机关增派巡警，严厉打击危害旅客生命财产安全的不法分子，为民除害。
    带伤奔驰的旅客列车
    外出者中，乘坐火车的旅客远远多于乘坐其它交通工具的人。人们在抱怨旅客列车超负荷运行的同时，还不时对铁路治安也发出种种抱怨。
    今年１月１３日，由广东湛江开往湖北武昌的１５２次旅客列车行至冷水滩站，２０余名歹徒蜂拥而上，他们手持匕首等凶器，对旅客强行搜身，先后抢劫８名旅客，共计人民币１万多元。其中５名旅客奋起搏斗时，被歹徒打伤，闻讯赶到的乘警当即抓获歹徒。
    ２月１５日，由贵阳开往重庆的３８１次客车上，６名持械歹徒抢去一名旅客所带的１７０元现金，然后打碎车箱玻璃，将那名旅客抛下飞奔的列车，使其摔成重伤。
    据铁道部公安局统计，今年一季度，全国铁路系统发生刑事案件４９０８件，比去年同期上升８７．４％；其中重大、特大案件１６０５件，比去年同期上升１５２．２％。
    丧心病狂地扒窃部分旅客携带的巨款，是不法分子的主要犯罪目的。今年１月２１日深夜，由黑龙江三棵树站开往辽宁大连的２０８次客车快到大石桥站时，睡在硬卧车厢的哈尔滨华昌摩托车商店业务员崔胜军、祁东风被搬动箱子声惊醒，发现随身携带人民币８万元的一只密码箱被盗，他们当即报告乘警。经调查，警察很快抓获了两名案犯。案犯中一人是长春铁路分局长春机务段的司炉工杨枫，另一名赵兵系长春市无业人员。
    据统计，去年全国铁路发生旅客财物被盗案件７９０９起，占全部案件的４１．５％，其中，港澳、台湾同胞和外国旅客被盗的重大案件６８起，严重影响我国铁路声誉。
    值得注意的是，有些盗窃罪犯往往对列车乘务员施以小恩小惠，以便为其犯罪活动打开方便之门。有的还拉个别列车员合伙作案。也有些抢劫、盗窃团伙是由铁路职工子女、亲属组成的。
    寄希望于铁道卫士
    目前，列车上旅客严重超载，站内站外、车上车下拥挤不堪。据说，北京火车站每天上下列车二十四五万人，再加上中转签字、送客接站的多达３０余万人。
    全国５０００万流动人员，绝大多数靠乘火车流动。
    春节后，京广、湘桂线一些农民和米贩子携带大量大米强行上车。有的一次带大米多达几万斤。他们雇人送米上车，列车进站后，他们一拥而上，将车门、通道堵死，乘警和列车员出面制止，他们却置之不理，有的甚至无理取闹，严重影响到列车的正常秩序。
    全国铁路公安机关去年抓获犯罪分子两万多人，其中有１．０６万人属于流窜犯和惯犯。北京铁路公安局今年第一季度打击处理的３６１名犯罪分子中，５０％是流窜犯。
    定员为１２８人的硬座车厢，常常拥进二百五六十人，超员１００％的客车相当普遍。拥挤的车厢，使盗窃犯更是有机可乘。
    过去每辆客车挂载车厢１０至１２节，目前经常加挂到１８至２０节。一列旅客列车增加一两千人，而随车乘警增加无几。乘警从拥挤的车头巡视到车尾常常需要花上二三个钟头。
    在同危害旅客列车的歹徒斗争中，列车乘警为维护乘客的生命和财产安全，表现出人民卫士的高尚品质和英勇的献身精神。
    今年３月２０日深夜１２时，由长沙开往郑州的２５８次列车在孝感站停车时，乘警吴建新发现１０号车厢有１２名操东北口音的可疑人，便同车长和另一乘警前去查票。
    当查验第一人车票时，发现那人腰别匕首。乘警收缴凶器后将他带往餐车审查时，其他１１名同伙纷纷拔出匕首，一拥而上、围攻乘警。歹徒见警察在车厢内无法开枪，竟疯狂地用匕首刺伤了乘警。
    面对危害旅客列车的安全，人民警察勇斗歹徒、打击犯罪的英雄事迹也数不胜数。
    今年２月１日早晨５点，５０７次客车快到信阳车站时，一伙歹徒偷一农民的钱包被发现后，用匕首刺伤失主，乘警牛广宇在１２号车厢堵住两名犯罪分子，当即制服一人，正当民警对另一犯罪分子采取制服措施时，从列车尾部又窜过来４名同伙，其中一人用弹簧刀顶住牛广宇的脖子。
    牛广宇当即向车顶鸣枪警告，歹徒慌忙把刀缩回去。另一歹徒企图夺枪，面对勇敢、沉着的乘警未能得逞。乘警牛广宇持枪将６名歹徒堵在１０号车厢风挡处，车到信阳站后，他机智地打破车门玻璃，鸣枪警告。
    此时，歹徒打开另一侧门企图跳车逃跑。车站派出所警察听到枪声，及时赶到，当场抓获两名歹徒。
    据铁道部公安局统计，去年全国铁路公安机关干警在与犯罪分子作斗争中，５人光荣牺牲，３４３人负伤。今年１季度又有两名警察在打击犯罪的第一线英勇倒下。他们为铁路治安、为人民安危贡献出了可贵的生命。
    有关人士认为，铁路实行大包干，面临新旧体制转换，铁路治安问题需要沿线地方政府和铁路各部门共同配合。此外，公安机关警力不足，全国５万余名铁路公安干警，分布于１０万里铁路线上，难以适应日益增长的铁路运输任务和治安中出现的新情况、新变化。
    打击犯罪乃当务之急
    面对严峻的铁路治安，铁道部公安局局长岳方准接受记者采访时，激动地说：“作为公安机关，维护治安责无旁贷，现在采取措施进行治理。”
    最近，沈阳铁路公安局抽调２７５名素质好、业务能力强的干警，组建了４６个旅客列车治安巡警队，于４月６日全副武装地登上本局４２对旅客列车，进行巡查整顿。短短５天，已破获刑事案件９起，查处治安案件３４起，打击处理违法犯罪分子１５７名。
    上海铁路公安局４月初在整顿客车治安统一行动中，调集了３００名巡警队员，全部登车执巡，共抓获犯罪分子２６名及其他违法犯罪分子１１１名。
    乌鲁木齐铁路公安处、郑州铁路公安局等地也组织力量，组建公开和便衣小分队进站上车，集中打击扰乱铁路治安、危害运输安全的各种违法犯罪活动。
    北京铁路公安局办公室主任孙宝林告诉记者，北京下设的６个公安分局已抽调３００余干警，登车打击流窜犯，制止违法犯罪活动。
    ４月１１日晚１０点，天津铁路分局侦察员冯继纲，在昌黎站发现７名男青年行迹可疑，即上前盘问。７人见势不妙掏出刺刀将冯继纲围住企图行凶，侦察员鸣枪示警，其他干警闻讯赶到，当即将７名歹徒全部抓获，缴获了凶器。
    铁道部公安局局长岳方准向记者透露，铁道部公安局部署各级铁路公安机关，采取强有力措施，严厉打击流窜团伙犯罪，整顿治理重点区段铁路治安，争取在短时间内遏制刑事犯罪上升的势头。
    据了解，广州铁路局在实践中摸索出一套发动群众，群防群治的办法。每当列车进入一度扒窃、抢劫风盛行的成渝区间时，列车长就通过有线广播号召车上的公安、武装警察和解放军官兵，带头维护车内治安秩序，广大旅客也积极响应，不法分子受到了强烈的震慑。
    铁路治安是个系统工程，人们期待着“工程师”们能设计出切实有效的对策来，更期待着铁路沿线治安出现良好的秩序。
