Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 27th

According to the Shanghai *Liberation Daily*, the Shanghai Municipal Committee has decided to rectify the *World Economic Herald*. The committee has stopped Qin Benli from his position as the editor-in-chief and a member of the party group of the *World Economic Herald*. The committee has also dispatched a rectification leading group to the newspaper.

It is understood that the newspaper, which was scheduled to be published on April 24th, used several pages to report on a memorial meeting for Hu Yaobang. Some of the content, if published openly, would be detrimental to the current stability, causing confusion and affecting unity and stability. Moreover, these contents were not reviewed by the relevant individuals. Therefore, on the evening of April 22nd, the responsible officials of the Municipal Committee and the honorary chairman of the newspaper met with Qin Benli to patiently point out that all newspapers in Shanghai had expressed their condolences for Hu Yaobang, propagated his excellent qualities, and inspired the people's enthusiasm for building socialism and revitalizing China, which is the responsibility of newspapers. However, some of the content in the *Herald*'s report should be selected and edited; otherwise, it would exacerbate certain factors of unrest. As a mass media tool, newspapers must consider social impact. This suggestion is also a form of care for the *Herald*. Qin Benli agreed and called to stop the publication of this issue, awaiting re-editing before printing and distributing. However, it was later found that the newspaper had already been printed, and some copies had been distributed in advance. Moreover, on the morning of the next day, some overseas newspapers reported that the *Herald* had been "seized" and "closed down," and similar news was also broadcast by foreign radio stations. On the afternoon of April 23rd, the Municipal Committee again requested the *Herald* to immediately submit its handling plan for the publication. Qin Benli and others decided to publish after re-editing, but by the afternoon of the 25th, the re-edited proofs were still in the hands of the *Herald*'s responsible person, who delayed signing off. Multiple phone calls to urge action were met with various excuses. Due to the *Herald*'s deliberate delay, it took three days, and in the end, the newspaper was still not published. Therefore, the responsibility for this issue not being published lies entirely with the *Herald*'s responsible person. On the evening of the 25th, the *Herald*'s responsible person sent an "Urgent Report" to the Municipal Committee, insisting on publishing the originally printed newspaper.

The responsible comrade of the Municipal Committee commented on this matter, pointing out that some people are attempting to use overseas public opinion to pressure us, which is completely futile and cannot shake our determination to maintain stability and unity. The *World Economic Herald* is a newspaper with a certain influence both domestically and internationally, and it has published many good articles on reform and opening up. Many comrades of the *Herald* have made great efforts to run this newspaper well. The problem this time was entirely caused by the *Herald*'s responsible person. To ensure that the *Herald* correctly upholds the Four Cardinal Principles and implements the policy of reform and opening up, promoting stability, unity, and economic prosperity, the Municipal Committee has made this decision. We hope that the *Herald* will adhere to the correct editorial direction, strengthen communication and cooperation with all parties, and strive to make the newspaper even better.

　　上海市委决定整顿世界经济导报    
    停止钦本立总编辑职务　派驻整顿领导小组
    新华社上海４月２７日电  据上海《解放日报》报道：鉴于《世界经济导报》总编辑钦本立同志严重违反纪律，中共上海市委决定，停止他的《世界经济导报》总编辑、党组成员的职务，并向该报社派驻整顿领导小组。
    据了解，该报定于４月２４日出版的一期报纸上，在用几个版的篇幅报道悼念胡耀邦同志逝世的座谈会内容中，有些如公开发表，对稳定当前局势十分不利，将会造成思想混乱，影响安定团结，并且这些内容又未分别经本人审核。因此，４月２２日晚上，市委负责人和该报名誉理事长约请钦本立同志谈话，耐心地向他指出，上海各报都表达了对胡耀邦同志的悼念之情，宣传了胡耀邦同志的优秀品质，激发人民建设四化、振兴中华的激情，这本是报纸应尽的责任。而《导报》这篇报道中的某些内容，则宜加以节选，否则，将会加剧某些动乱因素。作为大众传播工具的报纸，当然要考虑社会效果。这一建议也是对《导报》的爱护。钦本立同志表示同意。并打电话通知停发这期报纸，待重新编排后再印发。但是，后来了解到，原来报纸已经印好，有些报纸已经提前发出去了。而且，第二天早晨，海外某些报纸就刊出了所谓《导报》被“没收”、“查封”的消息，甚至外国电台也相继播出了类似的消息。４月２３日下午，市委再次要求《导报》立即提出版面处理意见。钦本立等当时决定改排后发行，直到２５日下午，改排后的清样还压在《导报》负责人手里，迟迟不签发。多次去电话催促，都借种种理由推托。由于《导报》故意拖延，用了三天时间，最后还是不出报。因此这期报纸至今未出的责任完全在《导报》负责人。２５日晚上，《导报》负责人给市委写来了一份《紧急报告》，仍要坚持发行原已印好的那张报纸。
    市委负责同志就此事发表谈话时指出，现在有些人企图利用海外舆论对我们施加压力，这完全是徒劳的，是动摇不了我们维护安定团结的决心的。《世界经济导报》是一份在国内外都有一定影响的报纸，曾在改革开放方面发表过不少好文章，《导报》的许多同志为办好这份报纸做了许多努力，这次问题的出现完全是《导报》负责人造成的。为了使《导报》正确地坚持四项基本原则和贯彻改革开放的方针，促进安定团结和经济繁荣，市委作出了这一决定。希望《导报》按照正确的办报宗旨，加强与各方面的联系和合作，努力把报纸办得更好。
