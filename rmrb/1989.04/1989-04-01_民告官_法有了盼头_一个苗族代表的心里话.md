As soon as he sat down with the reporter, a stream of words with a strong Hubei accent poured out of his mouth.

His name is Yao Shaobin. He has thick eyebrows, a broad face, and is 33 years old. He led the villagers of Baifeng Village, E'cheng County, to prosperity and was awarded the title of Special Labor Model of Hubei twice. This year, he was elected as a member of the county committee. He is representing the more than ten million Miao people of western Hubei at the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress in Beijing.

“In recent years, as the legal awareness of the people has increased, before the Administrative Litigation Law (Draft) was produced, there were cases of 'citizens suing officials' below. However, due to the long-term lack of democratic and legal traditions in our country, power can be greater than law, and coupled with the lack of specialized regulations in administrative litigation, the result is that there are very few cases where 'citizens win against officials.'”

“Just before I came to Beijing for the meeting on a rainy day, a farmer in his 50s came to the village committee office where I work. As soon as he saw me, he kowtowed and cried, 'Representative Yao, please speak for me in Beijing...' It turned out that he was a farmer from Wuli Village, Wuli District of our county, named Li Xueru. Before 1985, he was a well-known impoverished household in Wuli Village. In 1985, he signed a 10-year contract with the village committee to lease a tea garden, and from the second year, his life improved, with an annual income of several thousand yuan, beginning to shake off poverty and embark on the road to prosperity. However, the good times did not last long. In November 1987, the village committee, citing 'public opinion,' did not seriously consult with the lessee and unilaterally terminated the contract, reclaiming the tea garden and distributing it to other villagers. Li Xueru was dissatisfied and sued in the district and county courts, but lost both times. Later, Li Xueru continued to appeal to the prefecture court. Although the prefecture court's final judgment stated that 'Wuli Village Committee's unilateral termination of the contract without reaching a consensus through consultation is incorrect,' it also determined that 'Li Xueru's request to continue performing the original lease contract is not supported by this court based on the change in lease conditions, the tea garden being distributed to three people, and the fact that a year has passed. Considering the maintenance of stability and unity, and the stability of the production order, etc., this court does not support it.' As a result, Li Xueru appeared to win the lawsuit but actually lost. The 10-year contract received a 'termination of performance' judgment. Currently, Li Xueru, after suing several times, is in debt and has fallen back into poverty. Although the provincial and municipal media have also reported on this case, the problem has not been solved to this day.”

“This case shows that 'citizens suing officials' is not so easy. Although there was no Administrative Litigation Law at that time, as early as April 14, 1986, the Supreme People's Court issued the 'Opinions on Several Issues Concerning the Trial of Rural Contract Dispute Cases.' In the sixth item of this document, it is stipulated: 'Some rural contract disputes are caused by the lessor's arbitrary breach of contract or the illegal intervention of relevant administrative departments, resulting in breach of contract. In the trial of such cases, the original contract's effectiveness should be protected in accordance with the law. The lessee's request to continue performing the contract should be supported.' However, when encountering specific cases, these black-and-white regulations are often difficult to implement, it seems that 'the sky is high and the emperor is far away'! Therefore, farmers are looking forward to the early promulgation of the 'suing officials' law. The NPC is deliberating the Administrative Litigation Law, which gives the common people a glimpse of the light of the rule of law.”

### “民告官”法有了盼头——一个苗族代表的心里话

　　“民告官”法有了盼头
      ——一个苗族代表的心里话
    本报记者  王谨
    “把‘民可以告官’用法律形式规定下来，这是我国立法进程迈出的一大步。我希望行政诉讼法通过后，尽快付诸实施。”
    他刚和记者坐定，一串串带着鄂西口音的话语就从话匣子中跳出来。
    他叫姚绍斌，浓眉，阔脸，今年３３岁。他因带领鹤峰县八峰村的乡亲们致富有功，两次荣获湖北特等劳动模范，并在今年当选为县委委员。他是代表着鄂西十多万苗族群众来北京出席七届人大二次会议的。
    “近些年，随着人民群众法律意识的增强，在行政诉讼法（草案）产生之前，下面也曾有‘民’告‘官’的案例，但是由于我国长期以来缺乏民主与法制的传统，权可以大于法，加之没有行政诉讼方面的专门法规的约束，结果很少有‘民’告赢‘官’的。”
    “就在我来北京开会之前的一个风雨天，我所在的村委会办公室来了一个５０岁上下的农民，他一见我?头就拜，哭着说：‘姚代表，替我到北京说说话吧……’原来，他是本县五里区五里村的农民，名叫李学儒。１９８５年前，他是五里村有名的贫困户，１９８５年他与村委会签订了一份为期１０年的承包茶园的合同，从第二年起生活有了好转，年收入几千元，开始摆脱贫困，走上富裕之路。可是好景不长，１９８７年１１月村委会以‘群众有意见’为由，未经与承包人认真协商，单方面解除合同，收回茶园，分给其他村民。李学儒不服，先后到区、县法院告状，结果均告输了。后来李学儒继续上诉到州法院，尽管州法院在终审判决中认为‘五里村委会在协商没有取得一致意见时，单方解除合同的行为是错误的’，但又认定，对‘李学儒要求继续履行原承包合同的诉讼请求，本院基于承包条件已发生变化，茶园分到３人，且时间已经一年，从维护安定团结，稳定生产秩序等方面综合考虑，不予支持。’结果，李学儒看起来告赢了，实际上还是告输了，为期１０年的合同受到‘终止履行’的判决。目前，李学儒几经告状，已负债累累，几年前的脱贫户而今又陷入贫困的境地。尽管省、地新闻界对此案也作过报道，但是问题至今仍没有解决。”
    “这个案例说明，‘民’告‘官’并不那么容易。尽管那时还没有产生行政诉讼法，但是早在１９８６年４月１４日最高人民法院就颁发了‘关于审理农村承包合同纠纷案件若干问题的意见’。在这份文件的第六款中规定：‘有些农村承包合同纠纷是因为发包方任意毁约或有关行政部门违法干预造成毁约而引起的。审理这类案件应当依法维护原合同的效力。承包人要求继续履行合同，应予支持。’但是，下面遇到具体案例时，这些白纸黑字的规定往往难以得到贯彻执行，看来还是‘天高皇帝远’啰！所以，农民盼望‘告官’的法律早日出台。人大正在审议行政诉讼法，这就使平民百姓看到了法治之光。”
