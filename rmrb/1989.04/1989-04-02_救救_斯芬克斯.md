On the banks of the Nile River in Egypt, near the pyramids, stands a massive statue known as the "Sphinx," a lion-bodied, human-headed figure. Except for the lion's paws, which are made of stone, the entire statue is carved from a single, natural rock. It has long been a testament to the wisdom and skill of ancient Egyptian stonemasons and, by the late 20th century, had become one of the few remaining world-famous statues, attracting visitors from far and wide.

However, over the course of 4,600 years, the "Sphinx" has weathered the elements, losing its nose and much of its beard. In recent years, the rock has been eroded or damaged by wind, rain, and sand, with pieces frequently falling off.

For the past year, Egyptian geologists have been analyzing rock samples from the "Sphinx" to determine how to repair it. Meteorologists are monitoring desert storms that could cause further damage to the statue, while environmental experts are studying the impact of polluted air on its deterioration. Despite these efforts, there is no guarantee that the "Sphinx" will be saved from collapse. Archaeologists believe that the "Sphinx" is like an elderly person with numerous ailments, requiring surgery to continue existing. But what kind of surgery is needed? The world watches with bated breath.

　　救救“斯芬克斯”
　　曹聪
    在埃及尼罗河畔的金字塔旁，有一座硕大的称为“斯芬克斯”的狮身人面像。整座雕像除了狮爪用石头砌成之外，是在一块天然的大岩石上凿成的。它一直是古埃及石匠智慧的结晶和象征，到２０世纪后期，更成了尚存不多的举世闻名的雕像之一，为远近旅游者心驰神往。
    然而，４６００多年来，“斯芬克斯”栉风沐雨，已经缺鼻子、少胡须。近几年，岩石因风、雨、沙侵蚀或损坏，时有脱落。
    一年来，埃及的地质学家忙于分析“斯芬克斯”的岩石样品，从而对它进行修补；气象专家在监视有可能给“斯芬克斯”造成新的灾难的沙漠风暴；环境保护专家则研究龌龊空气是否对“斯芬克斯”有侵蚀作用。尽管采取了种种措施，并不能从根本上使“斯芬克斯”免于崩溃。考古学家们认为，“‘斯芬克斯’就像一个全身是病的老人，要继续存在下去就得动手术。”但究竟是怎样一种手术呢？人们正热切地关注着。
