After-school Reading

I am a bit puzzled as to why, when discussing whether to read or not, the focus is on whether it is "useful" or "useless." Is this not treating reading as a means of livelihood? If so, the answer seems clear: as a means of livelihood, "reading" has never been the best choice, both in ancient times and today, both in China and abroad.

Then, apart from its usefulness, what significance does reading have?

The British essayist Logan Pearsall Smith wrote in an essay titled "Consolation":
"Recently, one day I sat in the subway feeling depressed. To cheer myself up, I thought about the various pleasures of the world. However, none of them seemed to matter to me—wine, friendship, eating, love, or a sense of morality. Since there is only such mediocrity in this world, why bother to take the elevator back up?"

"Then I thought of reading—that beautiful and subtle pleasure of reading. This is enough, a pleasure that does not fade with age, an elegant and unpunished vice, a selfish, quiet, lifelong intoxication."

For this gentleman, reading is purely a consolation in life, and the only consolation. The Song Dynasty poet Qin Guan has a six-word poem titled "Ningpu Book Affairs": "Sweating while reading without stopping, everyone wonders what I seek. I do not seek further honor and success, just to pass the long days with reading." This scholar from Huaihai was so diligent, but only to relieve his worries through reading. Lu Benzhong's poem "Reading" says: "In old age, there is still a lot of work to do, but reading is in vain. At night, the insects chirp, and every noon, the rooster crows. Long quiet can forget the disease, and because of walking, I should go out and invite. Why suffer so much, burning oil and tormenting oneself." However, he not only seeks pleasure in hardship but also has grievances stuck in his throat. Donglai Master seems to sigh about his life's failures, and in old age, he can only pass the time with reading. However, since he says "self-torment," reading must still be the best consolation. The Qing Dynasty painter Huang Shiling carved a seal: "Regret not reading for ten years!" Such urgency is probably out of a deep love for books. The neighbor to the east, Japan's Kamo no Chomei, wrote in his essay collection "Tsurezuregusa": "Sitting alone under a lamp, flipping through books, it is like making friends with ancient people, what a joy!" This monk living in the 14th century used books to relieve his loneliness. Such joy is truly immersed in a peaceful and leisurely state.

The one who speaks most truthfully about a lifetime of reading is perhaps Ouyang Xiu's "Reading" poem in thirty-six lines. He said, in his youth, he first read the classics and saw their sharp debates, attacks and defenses, bold decisions, and could not help but be curious, thus taking reading as the greatest joy. As he grew older, he studied under a teacher, and reading had a clear purpose, that is, "to study hard for an official career, only to escape poverty and low status," so not only did he read painstakingly, but the previous joys also turned into bitterness. Therefore, he could not wait to succeed and burn his brush and inkstone. However, books still sent him onto the official path, and he was indeed successful for a while. But after half his life, recalling the years like flowing water, he still thought of his old friends—"the past joyful events, closing his eyes, he did not want to see," "buying books and returning by boat, building a house by the Yi River," "only then did he know that reading diligently, its joy is indeed boundless." From this, it can be seen that when books have no "use," or rather, when reading is not for "use," one can truly enjoy the joy of reading.

In this way, reading is just a personal hobby (sometimes it is even a hobby out of helplessness), and even as a personal hobby, it is not necessarily a wise choice. The British dramatist John Vanbrugh's comedy "The Relapse" has Lord Foplington saying: "To spend one's mind on reading is just to find some pleasure from the results of others' hard work and deep thought. In fact, I think a person with ability and education can have wonderful ideas popping up, which is enough for him to enjoy." In this gentleman's eyes, reading is really not a refined hobby. In other words, it is a choice made by those without "ability" and "education." Compared to chess enthusiasts, sports fans, and the like, it is probably less impressive.

In short, for the means of livelihood, "reading" is definitely not a shortcut. As a hobby, it is not necessarily "elegant." Because clever people do not read. Have you not heard of the poet Su Shi, after drinking a cup of good tea, suddenly enlightenment: "No need to stuff your stomach with five thousand volumes of text, just wish for a cup of tea and sleep until the sun is high!"

　　谁解书中味
　　晓丽
    我有点不明白，为什么在讨论“读书”与否的时候，要着眼于“有用”与“无用”。这里，是不是将读书视作一种谋生手段？果然如此的话，答案似乎早就有了：作为谋生之术，“读书”从来也不是一种最佳选择，古今中外皆然。
    那么，舍“用”之外，读书还有什么意义呢？
    英国散文家洛根·皮尔索尔·史密斯在题为《安慰》的一则随笔中写道：
    “前些日子有一天，我情绪低落地坐在地铁里，为了振奋一下精神，我默想人世间的各种乐趣。但是他们中间没有一种我似乎是在乎的——美酒、友谊、吃喝、恋爱，或者道德感。既然在这个世界里只能找到这样平庸的东西，那又何必坐上电梯回到那里去呢？
    “然后我想到了读书——那美好而微妙的读书的乐趣。这就够了，这种不会因年老而减色的乐趣，这种优雅的、不受惩罚的恶癖，这种自私的、宁静的、毕生的陶醉”。
    读书之于此君，纯粹是一种人生安慰，而且是唯一的安慰。宋代词人秦观有《宁浦书事》六言诗一首：“挥汗读书不已，人皆怪我何求。我岂更求荣达，日长聊以销忧。”这位淮海居士刻苦如斯，却不过借书解愁罢了。而吕本中《读书》诗则曰：“老去有余业，读书空作劳。时间夜虫响，每伴午鸡号。久静能忘病，因行当出邀。胡为良自苦，膏火自煎熬。”却又不惟苦中求乐，且不乏牢骚哽噎在喉。东莱先生似叹平生不得意，老来只得以读书打发时光。不过既曰“自苦”，读书想必还是一种最好的安慰。清代书画家黄士陵刻闲章一方：“恨不十年读书”！如此迫切，多半是出自一片爱书之情吧。东邻日本的吉田兼好在其随笔集《徒然草》中写道：“一灯之下独坐翻书，如与古人为友，乐何如之！”这位生活于14世纪前后的兼好法师是以书来解寂寞的。此一番乐趣，倒真是化入一片清静自在的悠闲之中。
    对一生读书经历道得最为真切者，或属欧阳修的《读书》诗三十六韵。他说，少时初读古人书，见其唇枪舌剑，是非相攻，去取勇断，不免生出一片好奇之心，因以读书为至乐。稍长，受业于师，读书有了明确的目的，即“力学希仕宦，惟期脱贫贱”，故非仅读得苦，而且原先的种种乐趣，也全作了苦味。因而恨不得一朝得志，焚却笔砚。不过，书到底还是将他送上仕途，也着实春风得意一阵。然而，人生过半之后，追忆似水年华，他却不觉仍思故友——“前时可喜事，闭眼不欲见”，“买书载舟归，筑室颍水岸”，“乃知读书勤，其乐固无限”。由是可知，书到无“用”之时、或曰读书不求“用”时，方可获读书真趣。
    如此说来，读书不过是一种个人爱好（有时甚至是无可奈何时的一种爱好），而即便作为个人爱好，它也仍然说不上是一种聪明的选择。英国戏剧家约翰·凡布卢所作喜剧《旧病复发》中的福平顿爵士言道：“把心思用在读书上，不过是想从别人绞尽脑汁、苦思冥想的结果中找点乐趣。其实，我想，一个有本领、有教养的人，灵机一动，自有奇思妙想联翩而来，这也就尽够他自己受用的了。”就此公眼中看来，读书实在不是什么雅好。换句话说，那是没“本领”、没“教养”的人才会作出的选择。若与棋迷、球迷等等相较，怕更要略输风采呢。
    总之，求谋生之术，“读书”决非捷径。作为业余爱好，它也未见得如何“高雅”。因为，聪明人原是不读书的。岂不闻诗书满腹的东坡居士佳茗啜罢，顿然悟道：“不用撑肠拄腹文字五千卷，但愿一瓯常及睡足日高时”！
