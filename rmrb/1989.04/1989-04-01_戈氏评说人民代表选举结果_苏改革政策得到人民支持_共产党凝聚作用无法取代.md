Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 30th

Gorbachev, the leader of the Soviet Union, stated that the results of the Soviet People's Representative election on March 26th demonstrate that the reform policies of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) have received "strong support from the people." He emphasized that during a historical turning point for the country, the party's role as a political vanguard is "irreplaceable."

According to TASS today, Gorbachev made these remarks during a meeting with news media leaders on March 29th.

Gorbachev said, "Those who failed in the election are those who have been slow in reform and have not closely connected with the working masses." He believes that through the election, the process of reform and democratization has further advanced. Although there were diverse opinions during the election campaign, people did not doubt the reform but firmly advocated for it. Moreover, "voters supported the party's reform policies in a complex domestic situation, where some external forces have been slandering the Soviet Union's economic conditions, ethnic relations, and other issues."

After criticizing those who advocate abstract theories such as multi-party systems, Gorbachev stressed, "The democratic system does not depend on the number of parties but on the role of the people in society."

He said that during the election campaign, the working people sharply raised the issue of defending the reform from the attacks of those who bewitch people's minds and anti-Soviet elements, which must be taken seriously. Efforts must be made to ensure that the reform is not influenced by those who "want to impose unsuitable slogans on us."

He also criticized those who doubt the necessity of the party's activities. He emphasized, "In the reform stage, the party is a creative political force in social development," and "it is the guarantee of the democratic process and profound changes taking place in Soviet society." He said that the party does not shirk its responsibility for the past distortions of socialism, and it maintains a critical attitude toward its own activities. The party will continue to expel from its ranks those who have done nothing for the reform and sometimes even defamed the reputation of the reform and sabotaged it.

Gorbachev, in his speech, called on the news media to continue to promote the reform.

　　戈氏评说人民代表选举结果
    苏改革政策得到人民支持  共产党凝聚作用无法取代
    新华社莫斯科３月３０日电  苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫说，３月２６日进行的苏联人民代表选举结果表明，苏共的改革政策得到人民“强有力的支持”；当国家处在历史转折阶段之际，党作为政治先锋队的凝聚作用是“无法取代的”。
    据塔斯社今天报道，戈尔巴乔夫是在２９日会见新闻界领导人时讲这番话的。
    戈尔巴乔夫说，“在选举中的落榜者，是在改革中行动迟缓和不密切联系劳动群众的人。”他认为，通过选举，改革和民主化进程进一步向前发展了。尽管在竞选过程中意见多种多样，但人们并未对改革提出怀疑，而是坚决主张改革，而且，“选民们是在复杂的国内形势下，在外部有人对苏联的经济状况、民族关系等进行种种诽谤的情况下支持党的改革方针的”。
    戈尔巴乔夫在批评有些人鼓吹诸如多党制等形形色色的抽象学说后强调，“民主制度不取决于党的数量，而取决于人民在社会中起什么作用”。
    他说，在竞选活动中，劳动人民尖锐地提出了捍卫改革不受蛊感人心者和反苏分子攻击的问题，对此必须认真对待。要使改革不受那些“想把不合适的口号塞给我们的人”的影响。
    他还批评有人对党的活动是否必要表示怀疑的想法。他强调，“在改革阶段，党是社会发展中一支富有首创精神的政治力量”，“是苏联社会正在发生的民主进程和深刻变革的保证”。他说，党并不推卸它对过去使社会主义变形的东西所负的责任，它对自己的活动持批评态度，党今后仍将把那些“未为改革做任何事情，有时甚至诋毁改革声誉和破坏改革的人”，从自己的队伍中清除出去。
    戈尔巴乔夫在讲话中要求新闻界继续为改革鼓风张帆。
