	Chemical fertilizers, you're so popular, your prices are rising every year, yet you're still in short supply. It's really enviable!
	Chemical fertilizers: Sigh, don't just look at how popular we are. We have our own troubles too.
	Organic fertilizers: I can't think of any reason for you to sigh. Oh, right, lately I've been hearing people say that chemical fertilizers are overused. The newspapers even say that China applies an average of 13.9 kilograms of chemical fertilizer per mu of cultivated land, more than double the world average. Is that true?
	Chemical fertilizers: Well, if you mention that, it really makes me feel wronged. The numbers aren't wrong, but the way the accounts are calculated is problematic. First, our country's land can't be directly compared with that of other countries. In the United States, 15% to 25% of cultivated land is rotated for rest each year, conserving energy for the next year, but in our country, land is scarce, and we emphasize high utilization rates, intercropping, and sequential cropping, using one mu of land like one and a half. If we consider the multiple cropping index, China's average fertilizer application per mu of sown area is only about 7 kilograms, which, although 20% higher than the world average, still results in an average yield per mu that is 50% higher than the world average. If we add the more than 100 million mu of uncultivated land that isn't accounted for, our fertilizer application rate is actually lower than the world average. Moreover, comparing just the application rate is one-sided.
	Organic fertilizers: Why is that?
	Chemical fertilizers: Even the same type of fertilizer can vary greatly in quality. The average effective component content of fertilizers produced in our country is only 24.5%, meaning that 1 kilogram is equivalent to only half a kilogram in developed countries. Even worse, because most places don't apply fertilizers according to scientific standards and don't pay attention to the timing, they just scatter them randomly into the soil. As a result, out of 100 kilograms of fertilizer applied, only 35 kilograms are effective, and the loss rate of nitrogen fertilizers is over 30%.
	Organic fertilizers: Looking at it this way, it seems that our country's actual fertilizer application rate is still on the low side. But speaking of which, if we don't decide to change the old fertilization methods, no matter how hard we try to increase fertilizer production, it won't withstand such waste.
	Chemical fertilizers: That's right. Someone calculated that if the national fertilizer utilization rate could be increased by 5%, it would be equivalent to increasing the current fertilizer production by 15%, which is equal to the amount of fertilizer imported by the country each year. As long as we can apply fertilizers scientifically, this goal is not difficult to achieve.
	Organic fertilizers: But you should take it easy. People say that using too much chemical fertilizer will make the soil yellow, thin, and hard.
	Chemical fertilizers: Do you also view us this way? We've been blamed for "hardening the soil and destroying fertility" for so many years, and it's really unfair. In fact, we chemical fertilizers are a big family, and there are many types of nitrogen fertilizers alone. The main nitrogen fertilizers used in our country are ammonium bicarbonate and urea, which generally do not harm the soil. The only type that might cause slight soil compaction is ammonium sulfate, which we use very little of and poses no significant threat. But it's this little guy who has caused all of us to suffer unjustly. Using more fertilizer increases grain production, and more straw and stubble increase the source of organic matter, making the soil even more fertile, loose, and soft.
	Organic fertilizers: But the degradation of soil fertility in many regions is a fact. Northeast China is famous for its fertile land, with the soil originally containing 5-8% organic matter, now reduced to 1-2%.
	Chemical fertilizers: This situation is not due to the overuse of chemical fertilizers but to the underuse of organic fertilizers. It's like making steamed buns with yeast, if you don't add baking soda or add too little, you can't blame the sugar for the sourness of the buns. Recently, Heilongjiang Province conducted a sampling survey and found that more than half of the households in the province do not apply farmyard manure. How can the land become more fertile with such practices?
	Organic fertilizers: That's fair. It's not that we love to complain, but in the past, we were the main meal for crops, now we've become a side dish. Although you are very capable, we play an irreplaceable role in soil improvement. You can promote crop growth with a burst of energy, but determining the "quality" of the land, enhancing the stress resistance of crops, and improving the quality of agricultural products mainly rely on us. To put it bluntly, although you are so confident, without our cooperation, you won't be able to unleash your strength.
	Chemical fertilizers: That's absolutely true. According to calculations, when nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers are applied in certain proportions, the fertilizer effect is optimal, but our country's soil is mostly deficient in phosphorus and partially deficient in potassium. Currently, the chemical fertilizers produced are mainly nitrogen fertilizers, with 62% of phosphorus and 95% of potassium relying on organic fertilizers for a considerable period. Moreover, soil rich in organic matter has excellent physiological functions for automatically regulating water, fertilizer, air, and heat conditions. Chemical fertilizers can only fully exert their effects under such soil conditions. In some southern regions of our country, the application of chemical fertilizers has been increasing year by year, but the production effect shows a decreasing trend, all because organic fertilizers have been neglected.
	Organic fertilizers: Without boasting, we organic fertilizers can provide all the nutrients needed for crop growth, including trace and ultra-trace elements, although the effect is slow, the aftereffect is strong. Speaking of which, we have been serving humanity in China for thousands of years, and there was no chemical fertilizer at that time.
	Chemical fertilizers: Don't bring up old history. When you organic fertilizers were working alone, for over 2,000 years, the grain yield was only about 100 kilograms. It was only in the past few decades, with the large-scale use of chemical fertilizers, that grain yields increased exponentially. Now our country adds thousands of new mouths to feed every year, if we still rely on you slowpokes, can we manage?
	Organic fertilizers: I'm ashamed, I'm ashamed! In the end, we each have our strengths and weaknesses, and we can't do without each other. In the future, we still need to work together, complementing each other, to make more contributions to humanity.

　　化肥与有机肥的对话
    本报记者　江夏
    有机肥：喂，化肥，你那么受宠，身价年年涨，可还是供不应求，真羡慕你们哪！
    化肥：唉，别只看我们走红，我们也有一肚子苦水呀。
    有机肥：真想不出你有什么可唉声叹气的。噢，对了，这一阵子总听人说，化肥施多了；报上还说我们中国平均每亩耕地施化肥１３．９公斤，超过了世界平均水平一倍多，真是这么回事吗？
    化肥：嗨，一提这事，就觉得特别委屈。数字倒是没错，可是帐的算法大有问题。第一，咱们国家的地就不好和国外的直接比。美国的耕地每年有１５％—２５％轮流休闲，养精蓄锐待来年，可咱们国家耕地少，讲究提高利用率，间作套种、茬口相接，一亩地要当一亩半用。如果把复种指数考虑进来，我国每亩播种面积施用化肥才７公斤多，虽然比起世界平均用量多了２０％，可是我们平均每亩产出的粮食比世界平均亩产高５０％呢。要是再加上没有统计进来的上亿亩耕地，我们施用化肥量就比世界平均水平低了。再说，光从施用量上比，也有片面性。
    有机肥：这又为什么呢？
    化肥：同样是化肥，质量差别可大着哩。我们国家生产的化肥，平均有效成分的含量只有２４．５％，也就是说１公斤只相当于发达国家的半公斤。更糟糕的是，由于大部分地方没按科学的要求施肥，不讲究施肥时机，就只随便往地里一撒，结果施１００公斤化肥，只有３５公斤发挥了作用，光是氮肥的损失率就在３０％以上。
    有机肥：这么一算，好像咱们国家的化肥实际施用量还偏低呢。可是话说回来，如果不下决心改掉老施肥办法，就是费再大的劲增产化肥，也经不住这么浪费呀。
    化肥：是呵，有人算过一笔帐，如果全国的化肥利用率能够提高５％，就等于把现在的化肥产量提高１５％，这相当于全国每年进口化肥的数量。只要能够科学施肥，这个目标不难达到。
    有机肥：不过，你们可得悠着点儿。人家都说，化肥用多了，土壤就会变黄、变瘦、变硬哩。
    化肥：你也是这样看待我们的吗？“板结土壤，破坏地力”的黑锅我们背了这么多年，实在太冤枉了。其实我们化肥是个大家族，光是氮素化肥就有好多种。我国施用的氮素化肥主要是碳酸氢氨和尿素，这两种肥对土壤一般没有害处。可能引起土壤轻度板结的只有硫酸铵，这种肥咱们国家用量极少，构不成多大威胁。可偏偏就是这个小家伙连累我们大家蒙受不白之冤。多施化肥，粮食增产，秸秆、根茬多了，增加了有机质来源，地只会更肥、更松、更软。
    有机肥：可是许多地区地力下降也是事实啊。东北以土地肥沃著称，原来土壤中含有机质５—８％，现在已经下降到１—２％了。
    化肥：出现这种情况，不是因为化肥施多了，而是有机肥用少了。就好像用发面蒸糖馒头，你没放碱或少放了碱，总不能把馒头酸的罪过记在糖身上吧。不久前，黑龙江省作过一次抽样调查，发现全省有一半以上农户不施农家肥。这样地哪能越种越肥呢？
    有机肥：这是公道话。不是我们爱诉苦，想当初我们是庄稼的主餐，如今却成了副食。尽管你们很能干，可是我们在培肥地力方面的作用不是你们能够替代的。你们可以一股猛劲地促使农作物增产，可是决定土地的“体质”，增强作物的抗逆性能，改善农产品的品质主要还得靠我们。说句不客气的话，别看你们那么神气，要是没有我们的配合，你们有劲儿也使不出来。
    化肥：这倒是千真万确。根据测算，氮、磷、钾肥按一定比例施用时，肥效最佳，但我国土壤大部分缺磷，部分缺钾，目前生产的化肥又主要是氮肥，磷的６２％、钾的９５％在相当一段时间内要靠有机肥提供。再说，有机质含量丰富的土壤具有自动调节水、肥、气、热条件的优良生理机能，化肥只有在这种土壤条件下才能充分发挥肥效。我国南方一些地区化肥施用量年年增长，增产效果却出现递减趋势就是因为冷落了有机肥。
    有机肥：不是吹牛，我们有机肥能供给农作物生长需要的全部养分，就连微量和极微量元素也不缺，肥效是慢了点儿，可是后劲大呀。说起来，我们在中国已经为人类干了几千年了，那会儿还没有化肥呢。
    化肥：快别翻老黄历了。你们有机肥单干的那会儿，有２０００多年粮食产量是１００多公斤。直到近几十年，化肥用量大增，粮食产量才成倍增长。现在我们国家每年都新添上千万张嘴要粮吃，要是还靠你这个慢性子当家，能行吗？
    有机肥：惭愧，惭愧！说来说去，咱俩各有短长，谁也离不了谁，今后还得搭伙干，互相配合，互相补充，才能为人类多作贡献。
