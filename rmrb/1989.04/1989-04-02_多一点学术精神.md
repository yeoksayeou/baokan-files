Today's Talk

	Browsing through bookstores these days, one is overwhelmed by the sheer number of new books. Academic works, in particular, are dazzling. “×× Studies,” “×× History,” “×× Theories”—series after series, like a grand procession, are truly impressive.

	However, if you pay a bit more attention and compare books of the same genre, you will find that many of them have similar content and are often plagiarized. One copies from another, and sometimes from foreign sources. Some “copiers” add “edited and translated” after their names, which is somewhat modest (though this is also inappropriate; if it is a translation, the original author's name should be listed first). Even more confusing is that some “scholars” do not mention the original author's name on the cover or in the preface, and instead boast about their own work. Uninformed readers might think that the voluminous works are the result of their own diligent research and writing! Naturally, these “scholars” do not list references or sources in their works.

	As scholars, one should uphold an honest academic spirit. First and foremost, one must respect the labor of others, whether they are domestic or foreign. If it is a translation, it should be clearly labeled as such; if it is an edited work, it should be labeled as such. One should not reap benefits without doing the work and deceive the public. As publishers, they should not only focus on quantity but also on quality, providing readers with more original works.

　　多一点学术精神
    王清宪
    如今逛书店，新书真是目不暇接。时髦的学术著作尤其让人眼花缭乱。“××学”、“××史”、“××论”，丛书一套又一套，像古戏似的，拉出来便是一队“人马”，蔚为壮观。
    但是，如果你稍加留心，把属于同类的著作拿来作一对照，便会发现，不少内容雷同，互相抄袭。你抄他，他抄我，也有抄外国的。有的“抄者”在自己的名字后面注上“编译”二字，还算是“谦虚”的（实际这也不妥当，既是编译别人的东西，就应署上原作者的名字，且应放在自己的名字前）。更令人迷惑的是，有不少“学者”的著作，虽系从外国抄来，但在封面的署名和前言中，根本不提原作者的名字，且颇为自得地在前言中自我卖弄一番。不知情的读者还以为，洋洋数十万言的巨著全是他潜心研究，勤奋笔耕所得呢！自然，这些“学者”的著述之后，从不列参考书目和材料出处。
    作为学者，应有诚实的学术精神。首先就是要尊重别人的劳动，不管这个人是国内的还是国外的。是译就是译，是编就是编，切不可坐收渔利，欺世盗名。作为出版者，不仅要图数量，更要讲质量，把更多有独创的著作献给读者。
