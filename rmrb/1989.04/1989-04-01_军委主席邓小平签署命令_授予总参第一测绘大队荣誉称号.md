The Central Military Commission recently issued an order, conferring the honorific title of "Hero Surveying and Mapping Brigade" on the First Surveying and Mapping Brigade of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army.

The order, signed by Chairman Deng Xiaoping, states that since its establishment in 1954, the First Surveying and Mapping Brigade of the General Staff has been responsible for laying out and measuring the national astronomical and geodetic control network, as well as conducting precise measurements for major national defense scientific research projects and key national engineering projects.

Over the past 35 years, with a strong sense of responsibility to "dedicate to the motherland, benefit the people, and bring glory to the army," they have traversed countless mountains and rivers, endured hardships, and successfully completed measurements in the Great Khingan Mountains, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and the deserts of western China. Together with other units, they have filled the gaps in China's astronomical and geodetic control network and land gravity measurement, providing accurate surveying and mapping support for the successful launches of China's man-made satellites and missiles, atomic bombs, and other tests. They have also completed important surveying and mapping tasks such as border demarcation, foreign aid surveys, and international joint surveys.

The Central Military Commission's order calls on all military personnel to learn from the First Surveying and Mapping Brigade's noble qualities of cherishing the motherland and benefiting the people, their tenacious will to fear no hardships and sacrifices, and their revolutionary spirit of selfless work and hard struggle. It urges them to be highly responsible for their work, pursue excellence in technology, and take them as examples to strive for the country's defense.
