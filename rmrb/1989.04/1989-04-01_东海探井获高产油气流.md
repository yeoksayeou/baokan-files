The rich oil and gas resources in the Pinghu structural belt of the East China Sea have been confirmed. The fourth well in the Pinghu area, drilled by the Marine Geological Survey Bureau of the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, has recently completed final testing and yielded a higher production rate of industrial oil and gas flow compared to the previously drilled Pinghu 1, 2, and 3 wells.

The cumulative daily production of high-quality crude oil from a single well is 1,892.85 cubic meters, and the natural gas production is 148.6 million cubic meters.

The Pinghu 4 well is located approximately 440 kilometers southeast of Shanghai, at the top of the Fangheting high point in the Pinghu structural belt of the East China Sea.
