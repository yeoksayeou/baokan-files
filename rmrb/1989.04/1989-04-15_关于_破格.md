On "Breaking the Mold"

Han Xuedong
Central State Organs Youth League Committee

Breaking the mold, breaking the mold in promotion, breaking the mold in employment, breaking the mold in evaluation and appointment, breaking the mold in admission, breaking the mold... It has brought young people both hope and pursuit, as well as confusion and disappointment.

The "mold" that is usually referred to as being broken is generally a marker of a person's natural attributes, such as length of service, age, seniority, military service, etc. These are the hard indicators of the "mold." It is based on this meaning that a certain famous social science institution in China has, over the past few years, promoted more than 10 young people under the age of 35 to the positions of senior and associate researchers. A certain large bank system in China, during the evaluation of senior titles throughout the system, promoted 2 young people aged 37 to senior accountants. This is indeed an absolutely joyful number. But when looking at the proportion of these "mold-breakers" among the total number of people with the same title, people cannot help but feel greatly disappointed: 1/100 and 1/1500. Breaking this "mold" is indeed not easy.

On the other hand, for some national-level research institutions, the promised titles for "foreign PhDs" before they return to the country cannot be fulfilled. Because "you have to count the years you have been in the unit and your seniority." A young economist with significant contributions was promoted to the rank of associate researcher by his colleagues several years ago, while he is still an assistant researcher because he is too different from others and not good at interpersonal relationships. These are the soft indicators of the "mold." When power, personal will, the mood of the person handling the matter, habits, and even thinking methods become the shadow of "years," the probability of being broken out of the mold is probably difficult to increase.

For young people, "breaking the mold" should be added with a "being" character. Breaking the mold requires a comprehensive effect of heaven, earth, and man, both to catch the policy fluctuation opportunity and to catch the clear small environment of the unit, and also to obtain universal tolerance. The process of breaking the mold has no legal procedure, and even no rules, mainly still a man-made process. As a result, the "mold" has obvious uncertainty.

For breaking the mold, many young people's hearts are filled with a sense of general despair: anyway, after five years of graduating from university, everyone is an engineer, everyone is a section chief, working five years, mixing five years are the same; anyway, joining the party considers more old comrades, promotion is more about balance, no matter how hard you work, it's the same; anyway, salary, bonus are fixed numbers, working more or less are the same... Of course, we should also thank the "breaking the mold" under the current national conditions, because it has indeed taken a small step of "not the same." I want to say that if in ten years the ratio of young high-level intellectuals is still the same as today, this result of always taking the elderly as the main body will bring hope to the country's culture and science?

The limitations of the breaking the mold formula come from three aspects. First, it is influenced by the traditional concept of seniority over thousands of years. In a certain sense, breaking the mold is a relaxation of this traditional concept, but in its basic line, it still continues the inertia of this concept, which of course also reflects the dilemma and incompleteness of the reform. Due to this outdated concept, it suppresses the formation of an equal competition mechanism, squeezing people's creativity and initiative into a gap. Second, it is influenced by China's respect for the elderly culture (non-moral meaning). In the production mode of small peasant natural economy, it forms a thinking pattern of "everything is better with the old" from people to things, from experience to theory. "Old ginger is spicier," this psychology is always quietly restraining people's minds. Third, it is influenced by the talent management system of "appraising horses." Since the "horse" is always appraised, and it is always appraised in the "herd of horses" in front of the appraiser, and the result of appraising horses is often certified with "breaking the mold." However, "thousand-mile horses" are run out, "whether it is a donkey or a horse, it has to be run out for a test." Since everyone can "run," and not just let a few horses "run," then how to "break the mold" is worth further discussion.

### 关于“破格”

　　关于“破格”
    中央国家机关团委　韩旭东
    破格堤拔、破格晋升、破格使用、破格评聘、破格录取、破格……，它给青年带来了多少期望与追求，也带来了多少困惑与失望。
    通常所说要破的“格”，一般都是某种人的自然属性的标志，如工龄、年龄、资历、军龄等，这是“格”的硬指标。正是根据这种含义，中国某著名的社科机构几年来共“破格”晋升了１０多位３５周岁以下的青年人为正、副研究员；中国某大银行系统在全系统高级职称评定时，破格晋升了２位３７周岁的青年人为高级会计师。这本是一个让人喜悦的绝对数。但再看这些破格者在同级职称总人数中所占比例时，人们却不禁大为失望：１／１００和１／１５００。破这个“格”，确实太不易了。
    另一方面，同是一个“格”，某些国家级的科研单位中的“洋博士”们回国前许愿的职称却不能兑现。因为“总要算一算你来单位的年头和资历呀”。一位很有贡献的青年经济学家，被他带领的同伴们早在几年前就进入了副研究员的行列，而他还仍是助理研究员，因为他过多的与众不同，太不善人际关系。这些，又正是“格”的软指标。当权力、个人意志、办事人情绪、习惯乃至思维方法成为“年头”的背影时，被破格的概率大概很难大起来。
    对青年人来说，破格应该加上一个“被”字。破格必须要有天时、地利、人和的综合效应，既要赶上政策波动的机遇点，又要赶上本单位晴朗的小环境，还要得到普遍的宽容。破格的过程没有一个法定的程序，甚至也没有一个规矩，主要地还是一个人为的过程。结果，又使“格”具有明显的不确立性。
    对破格，不少青年人心头弥漫着一种普遍的消沉：反正大学毕业五年后都是工程师，都是主任科员，干五年、混五年都一样；反正入党多考虑老同志、提干多是搞平衡，再怎么努力都一样；反正工资、奖金都是定数，干多干少都一样……当然，我们还应感谢现有国情下的“破格”，因为它毕竟曾迈出了“不一样”的一小步。我是想说，倘若十年后青年高级知识分子的比数仍是今天这样，这种总是以老人为主体的循环结果，会给国家的文化、科学带来希望吗？
    破格定式的局限性，渊源于三个方面的影响。一是几千年论资排辈观念的影响，从一定意义上说，破格已是对这种传统观念的松动，但从其基本线索上依然是延续了这种观念的惯性，这当然也体现了改革的两难状态和不彻底性。由于这种陈腐观念，遏抑了平等竞争机制的形成，把人的创造性和积极性压缩在夹缝中。二是受中国敬老文化（非道德意义的）的影响，在小农自然经济的生产方式上。形成了从人到事、从经验到理论“都是老的好”的思维定式。“生姜还是老的辣”，这种心理总是在悄悄地束缚着人的头脑。三是受到“相马论”的人才管理体制的影响。由于“马”总是相出来的，并且总是在相“马”者眼前晃来晃去的“马群”中相中，而相马的结果，往往又冠以“破格”加以认定。然而，“千里马”是跑出来的，“是骡子是马得拉出来溜溜”。既然大家都可以“跑”，而不是只让几匹马去“跑”，那么如何“破格”就值得进一步研讨了。
