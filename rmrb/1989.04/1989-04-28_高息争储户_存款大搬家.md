Title: High Interest Rates Lure Depositors, Leading to a Mass Transfer of Savings

In early March, various specialized banks in Nanchang County, Hubei, competed to attract depositors by raising interest rates on savings. Some banks offered an annual fixed-term deposit interest rate of 38%, more than three times the rate set by the state. As a result, depositors began transferring their savings between different banks. Some depositors carried cash from bank to bank, inquiring about interest rates, visiting more than 10 savings institutions in a single day. Others, who had deposited money just the day before, were already demanding to withdraw it to chase higher interest rates.

I believe that this practice of competing to raise interest rates seriously damages the good reputation of national financial institutions among the public and is far removed from the current requirements for rectifying the economic environment and order.

　　高息争储户  存款大搬家
    ３月初，湖北南漳县各专业银行为争取储户，争相提高存款利率，有的银行一年定期存款利率为３８％，相当于国家规定利率的３倍多。于是，储户的存款便在几家银行之间“大搬家”。有的储户拿着现金，逐家银行探问利率高低，一连走了１０多个储蓄所；有的储户昨天刚存款，今天闹着取款，为了获得高息。
    我认为，这种争相抬高利率的做法，严重损害了国家金融机构在群众中的良好信誉，与当前治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序的要求相距甚远。
