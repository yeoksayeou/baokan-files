Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 25th - The director of the State Council's Office for the Examination of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Imports, Ding Xiaorong, pointed out today that over the past five years, China's imports of mechanical and electrical equipment have amounted to over $8 billion.

The State Council's Office for the Examination of Mechanical and Electrical Equipment Imports was established last year as a temporary agency responsible for coordinating, supervising, and executing the management and examination of mechanical and electrical equipment imports. Ding Xiaorong emphasized at a national conference on the management of mechanical and electrical equipment import examinations that all import examination agencies must strictly enforce unified directives.

Ding Xiaorong proposed several specific measures:

- Strictly enforce the centralized approval plan for mechanical and electrical products that are restricted by the state, as approved by the State Council, and approve according to the foreign exchange quotas determined by the State Planning Commission. Import control indicators must not be exceeded and efforts should be made to reduce them.

- Strengthen the examination and management of imported project equipment, and promote the bidding system. In the approval and bidding process, efforts should be made to use more domestic products and reduce the amount of imports.

- Strictly control the import of single machines. For large-scale equipment and precision instruments with significant foreign exchange expenditures, promote cooperation and shared use to improve utilization efficiency and reduce unnecessary repeated introductions.

- The management of equipment imports for foreign-funded projects should be incorporated into a unified management channel, determine the proportion of domestic manufacturing; for those that must use loans, international bidding methods should be used as much as possible to promote more domestic equipment winning bids.

　　国家要求严控机电设备进口
    据新华社北京四月二十五日电（记者徐克洪、实习生徐伟）国务院机电设备进口审查办公室主任丁孝浓今天指出，近五年来，我国机电设备进口用汇达八百多亿美元。
    国务院机电设备进口审查办公室是去年成立的非常设机构，负责机电设备进口管理和审查工作的协调、监督、执行。丁孝浓在此间召开的全国机电设备进口审查管理工作会议上强调，各进口审查机构要坚决执行统一的政令。
    丁孝浓提出的几条具体措施是：
    ——国家限制进口的机电产品要严格执行国务院批准的集中报批方案，按国家计委确定的用汇配额审批，进口控制指标不得突破，力争有所压缩。
    ——引进项目设备要加强审查和管理，推行招标制。在审批和招标工作中，要争取多用国内产品，减少进口量。
    ——从严控制单机进口。对用汇额较大的大型设备和精密仪器要推广协作共用，提高使用效率，减少不必要重复引进。
    ——利用外资项目的设备进口管理，要纳入统一的管理渠道，确定国内制造比例；规定必须使用贷款的，应尽量采用国际招标方式，促进国内设备多中标。
