	The People's Daily reporter Xie Lianhui

	Hou Xueyu, academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, researcher at the Institute of Botany, is a renowned ecologist in China, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, chairman of the Economic Committee's Environmental Group, and an advisor to the State Council's Environmental Protection Commission. He has recently published books such as "Chinese Vegetation Geography and Advantageous Plant Chemical Components," "Ecology and Large-Scale Agriculture Development," and "Chinese Natural Ecological Zoning and Large-Scale Agriculture Development Strategy."

	Reporter: Agriculture is currently a prominent weak link in the national economy. In the process of implementing the policy of rectification and deepening reform, the state emphasizes stabilizing rural policies, actively promoting and developing advanced agricultural science and technology, and increasing agricultural investment to strengthen the momentum of agricultural development.

	Hou Xueyu: Agriculture is a very complex issue. In addition to relying on policies, investment, and scientific technology, strengthening the protection of the rural ecological environment should be given an important position. Over the past 10 years, the rapidly developing township enterprises have played an important role in revitalizing the rural economy, but they have also brought relatively serious pollution to the rural environment. I once conducted a survey in Suzhou, and the locals described the pollution of the Suzhou River as follows: "In the morning it is the 'Black Dragon River,' at noon it is the 'Red River,' and in the evening it is the blue 'Danube River.'" They also said, "In the 1950s, you could wash rice and vegetables, in the 1960s the water quality deteriorated, in the 1970s fish and shrimp disappeared, and in the 1980s it became a public hazard." During my surveys in Shandong, Guangxi, Sichuan, and other provinces, I also found similar situations.

	Reporter: It is said that 82% of the country's rivers, lakes, and reservoirs have been polluted to varying degrees by industrial wastewater.

	Hou Xueyu: Water is an indispensable input for agricultural production. How can you irrigate with water containing so many harmful and toxic substances? Crops and vegetables irrigated with wastewater have an unusual smell, and fish and shrimp in the wastewater accumulate toxic substances. Who dares to eat them?

	Reporter: During rural visits, I saw that some township enterprises have poor or even no dust control equipment, and the surrounding sky is hazy.

	Hou Xueyu: In some counties in southern Sichuan, they use traditional methods to smelt sulfur with an efficiency of only 20%. Producing one ton of sulfur releases about 2 tons of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere. The sky is covered with sulfur smoke, with acid mist on clear days and acid rain on rainy days, resulting in barren land where nothing grows, arable land that cannot be cultivated, and economic trees that have disappeared. It is said that there are over 30,000 acres of farmland directly polluted in the sulfur smelting area, and over 4 million acres of farmland have been affected to varying degrees. Last year, Sichuan Province began to rectify the traditional sulfur smelting methods.

	Reporter: However, farmland directly polluted may not recover its ecological environment in 10 to 20 years and cannot be cultivated.

	Hou Xueyu: The industrial waste and domestic garbage accumulated over the years in Sichuan Province have reached over 300 million tons, covering an area of over 30,000 acres. The farmland polluted by industrial waste is in the tens of thousands of acres and has not been included in the calculation.

	Reporter: Many reports reflect that township enterprises and industrial waste not only pollute the environment but also occupy arable land.

	Hou Xueyu: According to the report by State Councilor Chen Junsheng (People's Daily, March 26), from 1957 to 1987, over 30 years, China's total arable land area has decreased by 250 million acres, approaching the total arable land area of Liaoning, Sichuan, and Hebei provinces combined, with an average annual decrease of 800,000 acres. According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, in just 1985 and 1986, 24 million acres were lost, equivalent to the arable land area of 36 medium-sized counties.

	Of course, the reasons for the decrease in arable land are multifaceted, including water and soil erosion, land desertification, secondary salinization, urban expansion, construction of rural houses, digging fish ponds, open-pit mining, and restoring topsoil, as well as brick and tile kilns. However, the pollution and destruction of arable land by the "three wastes" from township enterprises are also significant.

	Reporter: According to data from relevant departments, in 1957, the per capita arable land was 3.59 acres, in 1980 it was 1.52 acres, and in 1987 it was calculated to be 1.33 acres based on population growth and arable land data from various places. Some experts predict that by the year 2000, per capita arable land will be only about 1 acre.

	Hou Xueyu: The population is increasing, and the arable land is decreasing. How can this be sustained?! Everyone is trying every means to increase the grain yield per unit area of arable land, which is correct. However, we should not neglect the rational use of mountains, lakes, rivers, and grasslands. There is also a worrying trend of blindly pursuing the "chemicalization" of agriculture.

	Reporter: "Chemicalization"?

	Hou Xueyu: By "chemicalization," I mean neglecting organic fertilizers such as farmyard manure and green manure, as well as biological measures for pest control, and emphasizing the use of large doses of chemical fertilizers and pesticides to achieve high grain yields. I must clarify that I am not denying the role and necessity of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in increasing production. I am against "chemicalization." In the past, whenever we emphasized "chemicalization," we often went to extremes, leading to waste of manpower, financial resources, and materials, as well as mistakes in work.

	Reporter: Indeed. Currently, in rural areas, people do not cultivate green manure, do not use human and animal waste, do not use coarse organic fertilizers, do not dredge river and pond mud, and only want white chemical fertilizers. Everyone's eyes are fixed on chemical fertilizers.

	Hou Xueyu: Chemical fertilizers are indispensable. When used appropriately, they can significantly increase yields. However, if one is afraid of dirt and trouble for convenience, neglects organic fertilizers, and only uses chemical fertilizers, over time, the arable land will lack organic matter, become compacted, and lose fertility, and the fertilizer efficiency will decrease.

	Reporter: I heard that the use of chemical fertilizers in rural areas is very wasteful, with more than 60% of the fertilizers not effectively utilized in the soil.

	Hou Xueyu: The application of chemical fertilizers is a science. First, it is important to note that inorganic and organic fertilizers should be used in combination to maintain good soil structure and fully utilize the quick-acting advantages of chemical fertilizers, as well as to provide trace elements from organic fertilizers during the growth of crops. Second, attention should be paid to the type of chemical fertilizer, that is, the ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, soil properties, crop types, and their growth and development stages, as well as fertilization methods and application rates. Otherwise, if fertilization is not appropriate, it will not only cause waste but sometimes may have negative effects. In some southern acidic soils, an appropriate amount of lime should be added, and in some northern saline soils, desalination is needed, etc. Only then can chemical fertilizers play a role in increasing yields.

	Reporter: The protection of the rural ecological environment has not been given sufficient attention in many places.

	Hou Xueyu: This issue must be loudly advocated. Not long ago, I visited a province and found that they were still using banned organochlorine pesticides such as DDT and BHC, causing pollution to farmland and crops. This pollution can affect human health through the food chain. When we prevent and control diseases, pests, and rodents in crops, it is very important to use low-toxicity, high-efficiency pesticides while protecting natural enemies.

	Reporter: To develop the economy, to rectify and improve the economic environment, and to enhance the momentum of agriculture, it seems that we also need to rectify and improve the agricultural ecological environment.

	Hou Xueyu: Without rectifying the rural ecological environment, strengthening the foundational role of agriculture in the national economy is just empty talk. Arable land is being eroded, farmland is being polluted, soil fertility is decreasing, and irrigation water contains harmful and toxic substances. What should we do? All levels of leadership and the masses must raise awareness of the hazards of pollution. For the development of township enterprises, we should start from the local resources and advantages, engage in pollution-free or low-pollution production projects such as planting, breeding, and processing, plan and layout reasonably from a macro perspective, and decisively improve the backward equipment and technology of township enterprises. Enterprises with severe pollution should be shut down and transformed, and cities should be prevented from transferring polluting industries to townships. The land management system should be improved to prevent the reduction of arable land. Protecting the agricultural ecological environment is protecting our living conditions and protecting ourselves.

　　发展农业勿忘保护生态环境
    本报记者  谢联辉
    侯学煜，中国科学院学部委员、植物所研究员，是我国著名的生态学家，全国政协常委、政协经济委员会环境组组长，国务院环境保护委员会顾问。近著有《中国植被地理及优势植物化学成分》、《生态学与大农业发展》、《中国自然生态区划与大农业发展战略》等书。
    记者：农业是当前国民经济中突出的薄弱环节，国家在贯彻治理整顿和深化改革方针过程中，强调稳定农村政策，积极推广和发展先进的农业科学技术，增加农业投入，以加强农业发展后劲。
    侯学煜：农业是个很复杂的问题，除了靠政策、投入、科学技术外，加强农村的生态环境保护，应放在重要位置上。近１０年来，迅速发展的乡镇企业对振兴农村经济起了重要作用，但也给农村环境带来了较严重的污染。我曾到苏南调查，群众是这样形容苏州河污染的：“早上是‘黑龙江’，中午是‘红河’，晚上是蓝色的‘多瑙河’。”又说“５０年代可以掏米洗菜，６０年代水质变坏，７０年代鱼虾绝代，８０年代变成公害”。我在山东、广西、四川等省调查时，也发现这种情况。
    记者：据说全国的江河湖泊有８２％受到不同程度的工业废水污染。
    侯学煜：水是农业生产不可缺乏的投入。水里有害有毒物质那么多，怎么灌溉？用污水浇灌生产的粮食、蔬菜有异味，废水中的鱼虾富积有毒物质，谁敢吃？
    记者：到农村采访，看见有的乡镇企业防治烟尘设备差，甚至根本没有，周围的天都是灰蒙蒙的。
    侯学煜：四川南部有些县，利用土办法炼硫磺，利用率仅２０％。生产一吨硫磺，排入大气的二氧化硫竟有２吨左右，上空磺烟笼罩，晴天是酸雾，雨天是酸雨，以致附近寸草不生，耕地不能种植，经济树木也绝迹了。据说那里炼磺区有３万多亩农田被直接污染，４００万亩农田受到不同程度的影响。去年，四川省对土法炼磺开始作了整顿。
    记者：不过，受到直接污染的农田，十年八年生态环境恢复不了，种不了庄稼。
    侯学煜：“三废”中的废渣也不要小看。重庆的嘉陵江段沿岸堆积了各种废渣６０余堆，冲入江里危害很大。四川省历年堆积的工业废渣和生活垃圾已有３亿多吨，占地３万余亩。受废渣污染的农田若干万亩，还未算在内。
    记者：许多情况反映，乡镇企业和工业废渣，一是污染环境，二是占用耕地。
    侯学煜：根据国务委员陈俊生的报告（人民日报，３月２６日），１９５７—１９８７年的３０年间，我国耕地总面积累计净减少２．５亿亩耕地，接近于目前辽宁、四川、河北三省耕地面积之总和，平均每年减少８００万亩。又据农业部统计，仅１９８５年和１９８６年两年中就减少２４００万亩，相当于３６个中等县的耕地面积。
    当然，耕地面积减少的原因是多方面的，与水土流失、土地沙漠化、次生盐渍化、城区扩建、兴建农宅、挖鱼塘、露天开矿恢复表土、烧砖瓦等都有关，但乡镇企业的“三废”对耕地的污染、破坏，也相当可观。
    记者：据有关部门资料，１９５７年全国人均耕地３．５９亩，１９８０年为１．５２亩，１９８７年根据人口增长数和各地耕地数计算为１．３３亩，有的专家预测，到２０００年，人均耕地仅１亩左右。
    侯学煜：人口越来越多，耕地越来越少，怎么得了？！现在大家都在千方百计提高耕地的粮食单位面积的产量，这是正确的，但也不可忽视山地、湖河、草地的合理利用。另有一种值得警惕的倾向，就是盲目追求农业“化学化”。
    记者：“化学化”？
    侯学煜：所谓“化学化”，就是忽视农家肥和绿肥等有机肥料及生物措施防治病虫鼠害，片面强调施放大剂量化肥、化学药剂，以获得粮食高产的办法。这里要说明，我不是否定化肥、化学药剂对增产的作用和必要性，而是反对“化”。我们过去一强调“化”，往往就要走向极端，导致人力、财力、物力的浪费，工作的失误。
    记者：的确。目前农村对肥料的使用是“绿的（绿肥）不种，黄的（人粪尿）不要，粗的（土杂肥）不挑，湿的（河塘泥）不捞，专要白的（化肥）”。大家的眼睛都盯着化肥。
    侯学煜：化肥是不可缺少的，施得适当，确实能大幅度增产。倘若怕脏怕累图方便，忽视有机肥，专施化肥，时间长了，耕地土壤由于缺乏有机质，还会变板结，地力衰退，肥效也愈来愈低。
    记者：听说农村施用化肥浪费很大，有６０％以上的化肥在地里没有发挥肥效。
    侯学煜：施化肥大有学问。首先要注意，无机肥和有机肥配合施用，既可以保持土壤的良好结构，又可以充分发挥化肥肥效来得快的优势，还能使农作物在生长过程中，获得有机肥中的微量元素。其次，要注意化肥品种，即氮、磷、钾的比例和土壤性质，作物种类及其生长发育时机和施肥方法、施用量，等等。否则，如果施肥不当，不仅造成浪费，有时还会起负作用。南方有些酸性土壤还要增加适量的石灰，北方有些盐渍土还需要洗盐，等等，这样化肥才能起到丰产的作用。
    记者：保护农村生态环境在许多地方还没有引起足够的重视。
    侯学煜：这个问题一定要大声疾呼。前不久我到一个省考察，发现那里还在施用国家已禁止的六六六、滴滴涕等有机氯农药，致农田和作物都受污染。这种污染会通过食物链影响人体健康。我们防治农作物的病、虫、鼠害，在施用轻毒高效农药的同时，加强自然界中天敌的保护是十分重要的。
    记者：发展经济，要治理整顿经济环境，增强农业后劲，看来同样需要治理整顿农业生态环境。
    侯学煜：不整治农村生态环境，加强农业在国民经济中的基础地位就是一句空话。耕地被蚕食、农田被污染、土壤肥力在减弱、灌溉的水含有害有毒物质，怎么办？各级领导和广大群众一定要提高对污染危害的认识，对于乡镇企业的发展应从本地区资源和优势出发，搞种植、养殖、加工业等无污染或少污染的生产项目，要从宏观上统筹规划，合理布局，下决心改进乡镇企业设备、技术落后状况，污染严重的企业要关停并转，禁止城市把污染行业搬到乡镇，完善土地管理制度，防止耕地面积减少。保护农业生态环境，就是保护我们的生存条件，保护每个人自己。
