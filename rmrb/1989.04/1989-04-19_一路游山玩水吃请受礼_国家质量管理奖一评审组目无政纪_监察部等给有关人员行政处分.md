The review group for the National Quality Management Award in the commercial, tourism, and service sectors spent nearly a month in 1988 indulging in sightseeing, feasting, and accepting gifts while conducting their evaluations. They spent 42,900 yuan, paid for by the companies being evaluated, with each member receiving gifts worth 1,100 yuan. Recently, the State Supervision Bureau, along with the supervision bureaus of the Ministry of Commerce and the State Tourism Administration, and the State Bureau of Technical Supervision, conducted a serious investigation into this case.

The review group for the 1988 National Quality Management Award in the commercial, tourism, and service sectors was organized by the State Bureau of Technical Supervision and the China Quality Management Association. Despite the group's six members studying relevant regulations and review disciplines before departure, they paid no heed to them in practice. From August 6 to September 4, 1988, the group visited Longchuan, Harbin, Beijing, Shanghai, Wuxi, and other places, staying in high-end hotels. For example, in Shanghai, they stayed in rooms costing around 200 yuan per person per day. The total accommodation cost for a month was over 12,500 yuan. They visited scenic spots wherever they went, such as Black Dragon Pool and White Dragon Pool in Beijing, and Dianshan Lake and the Grand View Garden in Shanghai. The travel expenses were all paid for by the companies being evaluated using public funds.

The group's members also indulged in extravagant dining. They accepted 15 high-standard banquets, with the banquet fees alone totaling over 11,700 yuan. Additionally, their daily meals far exceeded the standard and were often held in foreign guest dining halls.

All six members of the review group accepted gifts. The gifts were diverse, including transistor radios, high-end wool sweaters, pearl necklaces, gold pens, printed silk fabrics, high-end food, famous cigarettes, and famous liquors—everything from food to clothing and accessories.

Despite the fact that their accommodation, transportation, and other expenses were all paid for by the companies being evaluated, they also accepted cash under the names of "accommodation allowance" and "consulting fee," with each person receiving 220 yuan.

The review group's serious disciplinary violations had a very bad impact.

The China Quality Management Association, which is responsible for organizing and managing the "National Quality Management Award," recently reviewed this incident, examined their mistakes, and discussed measures to improve the review quality. The State Bureau of Technical Supervision and the China Quality Management Association held the direct leaders involved in this case accountable and decided to remove them from their positions as chairmen of the "National Quality Management Award" review committee. The State Supervision Bureau decided to give administrative penalties to the members of the review group, giving the group leader Ye Zhenghua a demerit and removing him from his position as vice-secretary of the Tianjin Quality Association; giving the members Chen Siyong and Shao Dasen demerits; and giving the members Xu Zhizheng and Wang Huicheng warnings. One member, whose errors were relatively minor and whose attitude was good, was exempted from punishment. At the same time, the review group members were ordered to return the gifts they received in violation of regulations, valued at 1,173.54 yuan, and the unreasonable allowance of 220 yuan, within a specified timeframe, and hand them over to the national financial authorities.

　　一路游山玩水吃请受礼
　　国家质量管理奖一评审组目无政纪
　　监察部等给有关人员行政处分
    本报北京４月１９日讯　记者舒瑜报道：国家质量管理奖商业、旅游、服务业评审组，在１９８８年度的近一个月的评审中，一路检验评审，一路游山玩水，一路吃请受礼，共花费受检企业支付的费用达４２９００多元，仅每人收受礼品的价值就达１１００元。近日，国家监察部及派驻商业部、国家旅游局监察局会同国家技术监督局对此案进行了严肃查处。
    １９８８年度国家质量管理奖商业、旅游、服务业评审组，是国家技术监督局及中国质量管理协会组织的。尽管评审组６名成员在出发前都集中学习了有关法规和评审纪律，但实际上置若罔闻。去年８月６日至９月４日，评审组先后到长春、哈尔滨、北京、上海、无锡等地，住的是高级宾馆。如在上海，住的是每人每天２００元左右的高级房间。一月住宿费共达１２５００多元。他们每到一处，游的是风景名胜，如北京的黑龙潭、白龙潭，上海的淀山湖、大观园，而且游览费用全由受检企业用公款支付。
    评审组成员大吃大喝更是十分突出。他们先后接受高规格的宴请１５次，宴席费用高达１１７００多元。此外，日常用餐也严重超标准，而且多在外宾餐厅就餐。
    ６名评审组成员都收受了礼品。礼品种类繁多，有半导体单放机、高级羊绒衫、珍珠项链、金笔、印花丝绸衣料、高级食品、名烟名酒，吃的喝的穿的戴的都有。
    尽管他们食宿、交通等费用均由受检企业支付，还以“住勤补贴费”、“咨询费”等名义，每人接受现款２２０元。
    评审组这一严重违纪行为，造成了很坏的影响。
    具体组织、管理“国家质量管理奖”的中国质量管理协会，近日就此事举一反三，检查了错误，并研讨了改进评审质量的措施。国家技术监督局、中国质量管理协会追究了涉及此案的直接领导者的责任，决定撤销其“国家质量管理奖”评委会主任职务。监察部决定分别给予评审组成员以行政处分，给予评审组组长叶正华记大过处分并免去其天津市质量协会副秘书长职务；给予组员陈思榕、邵大森记过处分；给予组员许之正、王惠卿警告处分。有一位成员，犯错误的情节较轻、态度较好，免予处分。同时，责令评审组每个成员将违反规定收受的礼品折价１１７３．５４元和不合理补贴费２２０元，限期退出并上交国家财政部门。
