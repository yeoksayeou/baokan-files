Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, April 15th.

The Nepalese government today stated that it is willing to engage in direct and in-depth discussions with the Indian government on the comprehensive relations between the two countries, including trade and transit issues.

This statement from the Nepalese government is a response to the statement made by the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson on April 14th.

The Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said that the existing disagreements between the two countries are not limited to trade and transit issues, and India hopes to negotiate with Nepal on various aspects of the bilateral relationship. Recently, Nepal and India have had disputes over trade and transit issues. India accused Nepal of violating several provisions of the 1950 Treaty of Peace and Friendship between the two countries, while Nepal believes that its actions have not exceeded its sovereign rights. India proposed signing a comprehensive agreement with Nepal that includes trade and transit, but Nepal insists on signing two separate agreements for trade and transit.

　　尼泊尔外交部发言人表示愿同印讨论两国全面关系
    新华社加德满都４月１５日电　尼泊尔政府今天表示，它随时愿意同印度政府就两国的全面关系，包括贸易和过境问题，进行直接的、深入的会谈。
    尼泊尔政府这一表示是对印度外交部发言人１４日发表的声明所作出的反应。
    印度外交部发言人说，两国现存的分歧不仅与贸易和过境问题有关，印度希望与尼就两国的各个方面关系开展谈判。最近，尼印两国在贸易和过境问题上发生争执。印度指责尼泊尔在许多事情上违反了两国于１９５０年签订的友好条约，而尼泊尔则认为，它所作的一切并未超越自己的主权范围；印度要求与尼方签署一项包括贸易和过境在内的一揽子条约，尼泊尔则坚持要将贸易和过境问题分签两个条约。
