New Hua Xun She, Macau, April 15th.

Zhou Ding, the Director of the New China News Agency Macau Branch, recently stated in an interview that since the signing of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration two years ago, Macau has maintained social stability and economic development. From various aspects, the momentum of Macau's economic development will continue. We have reason to be optimistic about Macau's future.

He said, we are pleased to see that the Macau government has done effective work in the past period to implement the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration. For example, the Macau government has stipulated that all future legal documents must be published in both Chinese and Portuguese, providing conditions to solve Macau's language problem during the transitional period.

Zhou Ding pointed out that the current situation in Macau is developing in a positive direction. The Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group has moved into Macau; the Basic Law Drafting Committee for Macau is proceeding according to plan and in a step-by-step manner; the Basic Law Consultative Committee for Macau will be established in late May; and large-scale construction plans for Macau are gradually being implemented.

　　周鼎对澳门前途表示乐观
    据新华社澳门四月十五日电　新华社澳门分社社长周鼎日前在接受记者采访时指出，中葡联合声明签署两年来，澳门社会稳定，经济发展。从各方面的情况看，澳门经济这种发展的势头还将继续保持下去。对于澳门的前途，我们有理由保持乐观的态度。
    他说，我们高兴地看到，澳门政府在过去的一段时间里，为贯彻执行中葡联合声明做了有成效的工作。比如，澳门政府作出今后所有法律文件均应用中文和葡文同时公布的规定，为过渡时期解决澳门的语言问题提供了条件。
    周鼎指出，目前，澳门的形势是朝着好的方面发展的。中葡联合联络小组已进驻澳门；澳门基本法起草委员会正在按计划、有步骤地进行工作；澳门基本法咨询委员会将于五月下旬成立；澳门大型建设计划逐步得以实施。
