Recently, the Shanxi Provincial Pesticide Inspection Institute conducted an investigation into 38 pesticide products from 18 production points in Xia County, Yongji, and Linyi. It was discovered that 34 of these products were unregistered and illegal. Most of these pesticides are fake and inferior. It is hoped that all levels of government will strictly prohibit their production and prevent farmers from being deceived.

According to the Shanxi Daily, the unregistered pesticide products include: "Anti-Wiltin" produced by the Linyi County Science and Technology Commission Hormone Promotion Company, "Anti-Toxin" and "Vegetable Spirit" produced by the Linyi County Science and Technology Commission Hormone Chemical Factory, "Wiltin" produced by the Xia County Chengguan Hormone Chemical Factory, "Anti-Wiltin," "Drought Resistant Agent," "Growth Promoter," "Anti-Toxin," "Cold Resistant Agent," "Antibiotic," and "Watermelon Hormone" produced by the Xia County Post and Telecommunications Bureau, and "Grain Strengthener" and "Wilt Killer" produced by the Yongji 575 Factory Workshop 10.
