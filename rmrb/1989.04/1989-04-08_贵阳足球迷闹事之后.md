This disturbance by football fans was completely unexpected. This is the third time Guiyang has hosted a similar football invitational tournament. Before this, every match had received enthusiastic support from the fans, and there had never been any unpleasant incidents. The reason this match ended in a disturbance was, of course, because the two teams did not play well enough, making some fans feel unsatisfied. However, the more important reason was the low moral standards and poor understanding of the game by a few fans, coupled with the instigation by some lawless elements. Of course, our organizational work was not detailed enough, and we underestimated and failed to prevent potential issues, which was also a contributing factor. The above remarks were made by a responsible person from the Guiyang Municipal Sports Commission when interviewed by a reporter the day after the disturbance on April 2.

The coach of the Liaoning Dongyao team said to the responsible person from the Guiyang Municipal Sports Commission when leaving Guiyang after the match: "Our team did not play well in this match, leaving a bad impression on the Guiyang audience, and we are very sorry to the Guiyang audience."

The news of the football fans' disturbance attracted widespread attention from various sectors of Guiyang society. Responsible officials from relevant departments of Guizhou Province and Guiyang City promptly went to the scene to help with the dispersal and persuasion work, quickly bringing the situation under control. On April 3, the reporter visited the responsible person from the Guiyang Public Security Bureau Command Center. The responsible person said that this disturbance by football fans had its reasons, although it was a very small number of people, the impact was bad. They disrupted the order of the stadium, affected social security, and damaged public property, all of which violated the social security regulations. Nevertheless, we adhere to the principle of dispersing but not gathering, and persuading but not provoking, always insisting on doing patient and detailed dispersal and persuasion work. In the end, only 10 of the ringleaders were detained. After interrogation and investigation, except for one person who was administratively detained, the other nine wrote self-criticisms and admitted their mistakes.

How did the disturbing fans feel? "I lost my head in the stadium, shouting and causing disorder, which was not the behavior of a true football fan. I violated the national law and am willing to accept punishment."

　　贵阳足球迷闹事之后
    本报记者  潘帝都
    “这次足球迷闹事，完全出乎意料。贵阳举办类似的足球邀请赛，这是第三次了。在此之前，每场比赛都得到足球迷们的热烈支持，从未发生过不愉快的事。这场比赛之所以会发生球迷闹事，原因固然是两支球队踢得不够精采，使有些球迷觉得不过瘾，但更重要的还是由于少数球迷的道德水准低，看球的水平不高，加之个别不法分子从中挑动所致。当然，我们的组织工作不够细致和对可能发生的事情估计不足、防范不够等，也是原因之一。”以上这番话是４月２日贵阳足球迷闹事的第二天，贵阳市体委负责人接受记者采访时说的。
    辽宁东药队教练在赛后离开贵阳时对贵阳市体委负责人说：“这场球我们队员没有踢好，给贵阳观众留下不好印象，很对不起贵阳观众。”
    足球迷闹事消息传出，引起贵阳社会各界的普遍关注。贵州省和贵阳市有关部门的负责人，都及时到了现场，帮助做疏导劝说工作，使事态很快得以平息。４月３日，记者走访了贵阳市公安局指挥中心负责人。该负责人说，这次足球迷闹事，事出有因，虽说是极少数人，但影响恶劣。他们破坏了球场秩序，影响了社会治安，损坏了公共财物，已触犯了社会治安条例。尽管如此，我们仍然恪守一条原则：可散不可聚，可顺不可激，始终坚持做耐心细致的疏导劝说工作，最后仅收审了其中１０个带头闹事的人。经审问调查，除一人被处以行政拘留外，其余９人写了检查，承认了错误。
    闹事的球迷心情如何呢？“我在场中头脑发热，狂喊乱叫，扰乱了秩序，不是一名真正球迷的表现。我违犯国家法律，愿受处罚。”
