Currently, in most regions of our country, oxen are still in use, and they remain the backbone of farmers' agricultural production. Just in the Guizhou Province's Qianxinan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, there are nearly a million oxen. During the spring planting and autumn harvest seasons, salt for livestock feed is indispensable for oxen. In the past, relevant state departments allocated a certain amount of salt for livestock feed to grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives and provided price concessions. In recent years, the special supply of salt for livestock feed has been canceled in some places. Especially last year, after the implementation of rationed supply of edible salt for urban and rural residents, the shortage of salt for livestock feed has become even more severe. It is suggested that relevant departments consider the overall development of agriculture and restore the special supply of salt for livestock feed.

专栏：建议与要求

　　请恢复耕牛饲料盐专项供应
    目前，我国大部分地区仍需使用耕牛，它迄今仍是农民进行农业生产的顶梁柱，仅贵州黔西南布依族苗族自治州就有耕牛近百万头。春耕秋种时节，饲料盐又是耕牛不可缺少的。过去，国家有关部门每年给基层供销部门下拨一定数量的饲料盐，并在价格上给予优惠。近年来，耕牛饲料盐的专项供应，在一些地方被取消了，特别是去年一些地方城乡居民的食用盐定量供应后，耕牛的饲料盐更为短缺。建议有关部门从发展农业的全局考虑，恢复耕牛饲料盐的专项供应。
