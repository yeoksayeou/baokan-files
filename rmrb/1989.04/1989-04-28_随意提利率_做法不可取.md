Street Talk

Recently, various specialized banks in Shaoyang City have been competing to raise savings deposit interest rates to attract depositors. First, the Shaoyang Branch of the Bank of China announced that starting from February 1, the interest rates for time deposits of 3 months to 5 years would be increased by an additional 5% on top of the new rates. Following this, the Shaoyang Central Branch of the Agricultural Bank of China and the Construction Bank of China announced that starting from March 1, the interest rates for time deposits of 500 yuan and above for terms within two years would be increased by 10%. Soon after, the Shaoyang Branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China also announced that starting from March 4, the interest rates for time deposits within two years would be increased by 10%. I believe that this practice of banks undercutting each other is disrupting the financial order and violating the state's interest rate policy.

I suggest that all specialized banks in our city should uniformly implement the interest rate standards set by the state and avoid arbitrarily raising interest rates. To compete in savings, efforts should be focused on improving service attitudes and enhancing service quality.

　　随意提利率  做法不可取
    近来，邵阳市各家专业银行竞相提高储蓄存款利率，以招徕储户。先是中国银行邵阳市支行宣布，从２月１日起，３个月至５年的定期储蓄存款，在新利率的基础上再提高５％；随之农业银行和建设银行邵阳市中心支行宣布，从３月１日起，５００元以上两年内的定期存款，利率上浮１０％；紧接着工商银行邵阳市支行从３月４日起，也将两年内的定期存款利率上浮１０％。我认为，这种各专业银行间互挖墙脚的做法，搞乱了金融秩序，违反国家的利率政策。
    建议我市各家专业银行统一执行国家规定的利率标准，不要随意提高利率。开展储蓄竞争，应在改善服务态度，提高服务质量上下功夫。
