In March, Europe screened a new film titled "The Wind."

When "The Wind" won the Golden Lion Award at the Venice Film Festival last year, the audience stood up to applaud the film's director, Joris Ivens. In February this year, during a preview in Ivens' home country of the Netherlands, Queen Beatrix attended the event. It is worth noting that 43 years ago, Ivens was accused of treason and had his Dutch passport revoked for using a documentary to condemn the Dutch suppression of Indonesia in 1946. Indeed, the winds of change have blown.

"The Wind" is a new work by the 90-year-old Joris Ivens. At the beginning of the film, viewers see the film crew laying cables in the Gobi Desert. The white-haired Ivens sits patiently on a chair atop a sand dune, waiting with everyone else for the wind to arrive. At the end of the film, there is a five-minute sequence of the wind and sand storm. The powerful wind sweeps across the desert, and millions of sand grains dance on the sand dunes. This powerful and moving scene brings a sense of triumph: the wind has finally arrived, and it has shown its strength.

The wind is closely related to human life, but how can one capture the wind on film? The wind has no shape, and it is impossible to grasp its thoughts, values, quality, or purpose. How can one capture the wind in a frame? According to Ivens' wife, Helen van Dongen, "The Wind" is Ivens' reassessment of his own life. She said, "It is extremely rare and admirable for someone of Joris' age to engage in such radical introspection, and it is impossible not to admire him." The protagonist of "The Wind" is played by Ivens himself. The main character in the film is a film producer who ventures out on an adventure, traversing space and the labyrinth of memory to find the strongest wind on Earth and capture it on film. The wind in the film represents the core spirit of all things. Ivens said, "To film what cannot be filmed is the most beautiful pursuit in one's life."

Ivens chose to shoot this deeply emotional and poetic autobiographical documentary in China because he is familiar with this distant country. He has visited and filmed in China multiple times, a country with strong contrasts and that has experienced numerous upheavals in the 20th century. China has a rich, ancient tradition that is difficult for Westerners to understand. While shooting "The Wind," the elderly and frail Ivens had to rely on a cane with a rubber tip to walk. He has a decades-long history of bronchitis and breathes with only one lung. Yet, he traveled extensively in search of the perfect shot, sometimes flying over the Great Wall, sometimes trekking through the Gobi Desert, and even visiting places that are difficult for ordinary people to reach.

For an elderly and frail man, the hardships of this filming work are unimaginable. Famous insurance companies like Lloyd's of London and others refused to insure Ivens. Ivens is not an old man who seeks only safety and tradition. He is still full of the pioneering spirit of youth, eager to explore and reveal the mysteries of life through film. In the film, he captures Chinese people practicing Tai Chi in the streets. Ivens believes that Tai Chi is not just a combination of physical exercises and breathing movements derived from Taoism; it also harmonizes one's breath with the wind and the universe. Ivens' work revolves around the themes of spirit, breath, and wind. During the filming process, once in a remote area of China, Ivens suddenly fell seriously ill and was close to death, forcing him to be rushed back to France for treatment. After recovering, Ivens returned to China to continue filming.

"The Wind" has a relatively loose structure, giving the audience ample room for reflection. This photographer, who has experienced the pain, longing, and illusions of the 20th century's revolutions and wars, finally captures the spirit that permeates the heavens and the earth—the wind—with an uncompromising spirit of adventure and a poetic documentary language full of poetry.

　　伊文思和《风》
　　梁丽娟
    ３月，欧洲放映了一部新电影《风》。
    《风》在去年威尼斯电影节上夺得金狮奖时，人们纷纷起立向影片制作人伊文思鼓掌致意。今年２月它在伊文思的故国荷兰预演时，女王比阿特丽斯出席了预演式。要知道在４３年前，由于伊文思用纪录片谴责了荷兰在１９４６年对印尼的镇压，他曾被指控为卖国贼并被吊销了荷兰护照。真的是风向变了。
    《风》是约里斯·伊文思９０高龄的新作。影片开初，人们看到摄制组在中国戈壁沙漠铺设电缆。白发苍苍的伊文思静坐在一个沙丘顶的椅子上，和大家一起耐心等候风的来临。影片结束时，是长达５分钟的风沙大作画面。劲风咆哮着横扫过沙漠，沙丘上飞舞着千百万颗沙粒。这强烈感人的画面给人以胜利的喜悦：风终于盼到了，风显示了自己的力量。
    风与人类生活关系密切，但怎么能把风摄入影片？风没有形状，也捉摸不到它的思想、价值、质量和目的，如何把风捕入镜头？按伊文思妻子罗丽丹的说法，《风》这部影片是伊文思对自己一生的重新估价。她说，“在约里斯这样的年纪进行这样激进反思是极为难能可贵的，不能不令人钦佩。”《风》中的主人翁由伊文思扮演。剧中主角是个外出冒险的制片人，他穿越空间以及记忆中的迷宫想寻找地球上最强大的风并把它摄入影片。风是伊文思漫长一生以及他从事电影事业的主旨。他在片中要捕捉的风指的是一切事物最核心的精神。伊文思说，“要拍摄无法拍下的才是人一生中最美好的追求。”
    伊文思所以选择在中国拍摄他这部充满深情和诗意的自传体纪录片，因为他熟悉这个遥远的国家。他曾多次访问并拍摄过有着强烈对比、经受了本世纪一再动乱的中国。中国有着丰富的、为西方人难以理解的古老传统。拍摄《风》时，高龄体弱的伊文思已经要依靠带橡皮头的手杖行走了。他有几十年的气管炎病史，只用一叶肺呼吸。但他却为寻找镜头四处奔波，时而飞越长城、时而跋涉戈壁沙漠，还去一些一般人难以到达的地方。
    对于一个年迈体弱的老人，这个摄制工作的艰辛是难以想象的。著名的伦敦劳合保险公司和别的保险公司都不愿替伊文思保险。伊文思不是个只求稳妥、按传统办事的老人。他仍然充满年青人的进取激情，极力要通过影片来探索和揭示生命的奥秘。他在片中拍摄了在街头打太极拳的中国人。伊文思认为太极拳不仅是体操动作与源于道教的呼吸运动二者的结合，它还使人的呼吸与风、与宇宙相协调。伊文思这部作品就是围绕着精神、呼吸和风的主题展开的。拍摄过程中，有一次在中国的边远地区，伊文思突然患了重病濒于死亡，不得不赶紧用飞机运回法国治疗。伊文思恢复健康后，又继续回到中国拍片了。
    《风》的结构比较松散，使观众有广阔的思索余地。这位历经了本世纪革命和战争的痛苦、渴望和幻觉的摄影艺术家用毫不妥协的冒险精神和充满诗意的纪录片语言终于捕捉到了充斥天地之气——风。
