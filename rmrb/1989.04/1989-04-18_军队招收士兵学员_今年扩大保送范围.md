The General Staff Department and the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army have recently decided to expand the scope of recommendations for the recruitment of soldier-students in military academies this year, providing more opportunities for outstanding talents who excel in both military and political aspects to further their studies.

The practice of recommending soldier-students for admission to military academies began in 1986. This year, the proportion of recommended admissions has been increased. According to the regulations, those who have been recognized as advanced individuals by military region-level units or have been awarded second-class merits or higher, and who meet the admission requirements in terms of education, age, and physical condition, can be admitted without taking the entrance examination. Excellent squad leaders and deputy squad leaders in combat squads, who meet the admission requirements in terms of education, age, and physical condition, can be admitted with additional points after participating in the unified national military and cultural subject examinations.

This year, military academies have significantly increased the proportion of military subject scores in the total admission score. Those whose military performance does not meet the required standards will not be admitted. At the same time, the scope of directed recruitment and directed allocation has been expanded to address the issue of the disconnect between admission and post-graduation allocation.

　　军队招收士兵学员
　　今年扩大保送范围
    新华社北京４月１８日电　（通讯员李玉良）解放军总参谋部、总政治部新近决定，军队院校今年招收士兵学员将扩大保送范围，为军政兼优的优秀人才提供更多的深造机会。
    军队院校招收士兵学员１９８６年开始实行保送入学制度，今年增加了保送的比例。按规定，曾被大军区级单位树立为先进人物或荣立二等功以上者，在文化程度、年龄、身体等方面符合招生条件的，可免试入学；战斗班的优秀班长、副班长在文化程度、年龄、身体等方面符合招生条件者，在参加全军文化科目统一考试后，可加分按分配名额录取。
    今年军校招生大幅度提高了军事科目考核成绩在录取总分中的比例。军事成绩达不到一定标准的不能录取。同时，还扩大了定向招生、定向分配的范围，以解决录取与毕业分配脱节的问题。
