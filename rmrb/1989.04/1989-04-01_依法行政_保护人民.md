Administrative Law and Protecting the People

	By Meng Xiaoyun, Reporter for this newspaper

	While the National People's Congress was reviewing the draft of the Administrative Litigation Law, Professor Li Jingxi told our reporter, "No matter how you evaluate this matter, it is not an overstatement."

	He told the reporter that China already has two types of litigation laws: the Civil Procedure Law is for citizen vs. citizen cases, and the Criminal Procedure Law, in a sense, is for government vs. citizen cases. What we lack is a law for citizens to sue the government. The drafting of the Administrative Litigation Law fills this gap.

	Li Jingxi evaluated the necessity of the Administrative Litigation Law from three aspects. First, the exercise of administrative power in a modernized state must be based on the law and under the supervision of the people. The administrative work of administrative organs must be conducted in accordance with the law because from the central government to the local governments, administration itself is a large system. If leaders at all levels do not act in accordance with the law, administration will be chaotic, and this system will be in disorder. Both the Civil Procedure Law and the Criminal Procedure Law stipulate that the plaintiff bears the burden of proof, while the Administrative Litigation Law reverses this, stipulating that the defendant—the administrative organ—bears the burden of proof for its specific administrative actions. If you harm the people, the people can sue you. Second, the administrative power of a modernized state must be constrained by judicial power. Our country's administrative power is very extensive. If power is not constrained, it will lead to the abuse of power. For this reason, this administrative power must be constrained by another power, which is judicial power. This is an inevitable rule in the operation of a state system, and no country can escape it. The administrative actions of administrative organs and administrative personnel that are illegal or inappropriate will be judged by the people's courts; otherwise, these people can do whatever they want. Third, the drafting of the Administrative Litigation Law further ensures that the legal rights of the people are more effectively protected. Officials who commit crimes will also have to sit in the defendant's seat, which undoubtedly embodies the principle that the law is equal for all.

	How to ensure that the law is strictly followed? Professor Li Jingxi offered the following opinions: First, party and government leaders must attach importance to legal system building and not treat the law as dispensable. They should not act according to their own will but be loyal to the law, which means being loyal to the people. Second, due to the constraints of the unreasonable personnel system, courts often cannot fully independently exercise their judicial power. It is suggested that the personnel system of the courts be improved accordingly. Third, legal awareness should be universalized, so that the people understand the law and use it to protect themselves. Fourth, the issue of rule by man versus rule by law. Previously, legal education was about making the common people obey the law, with little emphasis on making leaders at all levels obey the law. Now, officials who violate the law will also be subject to sanctions.

　　依法行政　保护人民
    本报记者  孟晓云
    人大审议行政诉讼法草案之际，李景禧教授对记者说：“无论怎样评价这件事的意义都不过分。”
    他告诉记者，我国已经有两种诉讼法：民事诉讼法是民告民的法，刑事诉讼法在某种意义上是官告民的法。我们缺少的是民告官的法，行政诉讼法的制定则填补了这个空白。
    李景禧从三个方面评价了行政诉讼法的必要性。一、现代化的国家行政权的行使要有法必依，要在人民的监督之下。行政机关的行政工作必须依法行政，因为从中央到地方行政本身就是一个大的系统工程，各级领导如不依法办事，行政就无章可循，这个系统就会出乱子。民诉法和刑诉法都规定原告负举证责任，行政诉讼法则倒置过来，规定被告——行政机关要对其具体行政行为负举证责任，如果你伤害了人民，人民则可告你。二、现代化国家行政权必须受到司法权的约束，我们国家的行政权是非常广泛的，如果权力不受制约便会导致权力的滥用。正因为如此，这种行政权力必须受到另一种权力的制约，此权力便是司法权。这是国家制度运行中的必然规律，任何国家都不能逃脱。行政机关和行政工作人员的行政行为违法或不当，将受到人民法院的审判，否则这些人就可以为所欲为。三、行政诉讼法的制定进一步使人民的合法权利得到更有效的保护。做官的犯了罪同样要坐到被告席上，这无疑体现了法律面前人人平等。
    怎样做到有法必依？李景禧教授发表了如下见解：一是党政领导要重视法制，不要把法看成可有可无，不能按照自己的意志办事，忠于法就是忠于人民；二是鉴于受不尽合理的人事制度的制约，法院往往不能完全独立行使审判权，建议法院的人事制度做出相应的改进；三是法律意识要全民化，让人民懂法、用法，学会用法律武器保护自己；四是人治和法治的问题，以前普法教育是让老百姓守法，很少讲让各级领导者守法。如今“官”违反了法也要受到制裁。
