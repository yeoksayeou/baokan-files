Beijing Issues Regulations to Prohibit Illegal Hunting of Wildlife

	BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Citizens have the obligation to protect wildlife resources and the right to report or accuse those who occupy or destroy wildlife resources. Parks, forests, and scenic areas should hang nest boxes, set up bird feeders, and bathing areas to artificially attract and protect wild birds.

	The above provisions were adopted at the 10th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Ninth Beijing Municipal People's Congress, which was held today. The meeting passed the draft of the Measures for the Protection of Wildlife.

	The draft prohibits any unit or individual from destroying the living environment of wildlife; prohibits any unit or individual from illegally hunting, killing, or capturing state-protected and Beijing-protected wildlife; and prohibits the sale or purchase of state-protected and Beijing-protected wildlife or their products.
