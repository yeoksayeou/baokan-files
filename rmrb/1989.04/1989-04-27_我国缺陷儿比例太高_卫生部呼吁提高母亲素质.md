The People's Daily, Beijing, April 26th - Reporter Ài Xiào reports: At today's inaugural meeting of the China Association for Maternal and Child Health, Minister of Health Chen Minzhang pointed out: Currently, in China, one out of every 20 people is a disabled person, with the majority being deaf-mute, mentally retarded, multiple disabilities, and mental illness patients. The national birth defect rate is 13.07‰, with the highest province reaching 20‰. Based on this calculation, during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period, out of 100 million newborns, at least 2 million will have birth defects; among the 330 million children in the country, at least 3.5 million will have intellectual disabilities, with 1.2 million being severely intellectually disabled. Eugenics and optimal childbirth are crucial for the rejuvenation of China and must receive high attention from the entire society.

Chen Minzhang said: "The factors leading to defective births are multifaceted, with the mother's quality being a significant factor. Currently, among China's 200 million illiterates, 80% are women. Among the 40 million dropouts, the majority are girls. The role and importance of mothers in early intelligence development are irreplaceable by anyone. Educators must first be educated. We must place greater emphasis on improving the quality of mothers."

　　我国缺陷儿比例太高     
    卫生部呼吁提高母亲素质
    本报北京４月２６日讯  记者艾笑报道：卫生部部长陈敏章在今天召开的中国优生优育协会成立大会上指出：当今中国，每２０个人中就有一个残疾人，其中聋哑痴呆、综合残疾和精神病患者占绝大多数。全国出生缺陷总发生率为１３．０７‰，最高省份达２０‰。以此推算，“七五”期间１亿新生儿中出生缺陷至少要有２００万；在全国３．３亿儿童中，智力低下的患儿至少３５０万，其中严重智下者１２０万。优生优育是振兴中华的大事，必须引起全社会的高度重视。
    陈敏章说：“造成劣生的因素是多方面的，其中母亲素质是一个重要原因。目前，我国２亿多文盲中妇女占８０％，４０００万辍学儿童中，女孩占多数。母亲在早期智力开发中的地位和作用，是任何人难以取代的。教育者必须先受教育，必须把提高母亲的素质，放在一个更加重要的位置上加以重视。”
