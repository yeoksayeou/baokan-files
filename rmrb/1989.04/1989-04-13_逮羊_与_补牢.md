Title: Catching the Sheep and Repairing the Pen

Since 1981, the State Council has organized six major financial, tax, and price inspections. Each inspection has recovered tens of billions of yuan of lost funds for the national treasury, which is not exactly overflowing. The results are significant, and the inspections are indeed important.

However, while acknowledging the achievements, people cannot help but feel a sense of worry: why do violations of financial discipline persist year after year, becoming more severe with each inspection?

The ancient saying "After the sheep are lost, repairing the pen is not too late" seems to offer some enlightenment. An annual major inspection is a measure to "repair the pen." Simply recovering the funds from violations without paying attention to drawing lessons and improving financial systems in a timely manner is like "catching" the escaped "sheep" but not truly repairing the "pen."

It must be said that we have not done enough in "repairing the pen." In recent years, many violations of financial discipline have exploited loopholes in lax management and weak systems. For example, the number of individual industrial and commercial households has increased rapidly, but many of these households do not keep accounts, making it difficult for supervisory departments to conduct inspections. The accounting management of many state-owned and collective enterprises and institutions is also chaotic, with some having incomplete ledgers and others maintaining two sets of books—one real and one fake. This provides convenience for behaviors such as arbitrarily allocating costs, falsely reporting losses, embezzling profits, using public funds for entertaining and gift-giving, purchasing restricted or banned goods, and distributing money and goods indiscriminately.

Another example is the management of invoices, which also has many problems. Invoices are vouchers for financial receipts and expenditures, and the basis for tax audits. There should be a strict set of regulations for the printing, issuance, use, and storage of invoices. However, current management is lax, and many units violate regulations, even altering or forging invoices or using blank receipts instead of invoices for accounting. Last year, relevant departments inspected 7.59 million taxpayers and found that 1.13 million of them were using invoices to evade taxes.

For many serious violations, simply recovering the funds economically is not enough. Various regulations and systems should be established and improved in a timely manner, and those who should be penalized should be penalized, and those who should be held accountable should be held accountable. Although we have initially established financial systems, due to lax management and lenient handling of discovered problems, many places and departments treat regulations and systems as mere "decorations," always doing as they please, leading to widespread violations of financial discipline. It seems that if the "pen" is not repaired or is repaired poorly, even if the "sheep" are caught, they will still escape.

How to combine major inspections with daily financial management work to prevent problems before they arise seems to warrant attention from all parties. If various loopholes can be plugged, the current widespread violations of financial discipline can be corrected. As the number of "lost sheep" decreases, the burden of major inspections will lighten, until the need for "campaign-style" major inspections is completely eliminated. This is the result we hope to achieve.

### “逮羊”与“补牢”

　　“逮羊”与“补牢”
　　钊拓
    自1981年以来，国务院已组织了六次财税物价大检查。每次大检查，都为并不充盈的国库追回几十亿流失资金，成果不可谓不大，大检查不可谓不重要。
    可是，在看到成绩的同时，人们也不免生出一丝隐忧：年年搞大检查，为什么年年违反财经纪律的行为却禁而不止，越查越严重呢？
      “亡羊而补牢，未为迟也”。这句古语似乎可以给人启发。一年一次的大检查，属于“补牢”之举。仅仅追回违纪金额，而不注意认真吸取教训，及时完善财经制度，那就像是“逮”回了逃走的“羊”，并没有真正把“牢”补好。
    应当说，“补牢”的事我们做得很不够。这几年许多违反财经纪律的行为，正是钻了制度不严、管理疏松的空子。譬如，近年个体工商户发展很快，但由于不少个体户不建帐，使监督部门无帐可查。一些国营、集体企业和事业单位帐务管理也十分混乱，有的帐册不全，有的搞真假两本帐。这就给乱摊成本、虚报亏损、截留利润以及动用公款请客送礼、擅购专控禁购商品、滥发钱物等违纪行为提供了方便。
    又如发票管理，现在问题也很多。发票是财务收支、会计核算的凭证，税务稽查的依据，应该有一套严格的印、领、用、存发票的管理制度。但现在管理不严，许多单位违反规定，甚至涂改伪造发票，或用白条代替发票入帐。去年有关部门对759万纳税户进行了检查，发现利用发票偷漏税的竟达113万户。
    有许多严重违纪问题，仅仅从经济上追回违纪金额是不够的，应该及时建立、健全各种规章制度，并按规定，该处罚的处罚、该追究责任的追究责任。现在，我们虽然初步建立了财经制度，但由于管理不严，发现问题后处理失之过宽，致使不少地方、不少部门视规章制度为“摆设”，总是我行我素，发生大面积违反财经纪律的现象。看来，“亡羊”而不补“牢”，或者“牢”补得不结实，即使把“羊”逮回来，仍然会跑掉。
    如何把大检查与日常的财经管理工作结合起来，防患于未然，似应引起各方面的重视。如果能堵住各种漏洞，目前存在的普遍违反财经纪律的现象就可以得到纠正。随着“亡羊”越来越少，大检查的负担就会越来越轻，直至搞“运动”式的大检查完全废止，这才是我们希望的结果。
