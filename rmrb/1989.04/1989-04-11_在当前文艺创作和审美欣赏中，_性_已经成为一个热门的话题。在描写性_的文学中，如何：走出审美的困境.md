In contemporary literary creation and aesthetic appreciation, "sex" has become a hot topic. In literature that describes sex, how can one:

Break Free from Aesthetic Dilemmas

Presenting "sex" through aesthetics is no easy task. Moreover, for a long time in our country, "sex" has been considered a taboo subject in scientific research, making the challenge even greater. In recent years, with the trend of exploration and the influence of Western culture, sexology and sex education have begun to take root and flourish. Literary creation has also seized the opportunity to produce a batch of works that touch on the subject of sex. Uncultivated land always has an infinite allure, to the extent that some people have suddenly discovered that Chinese literature has seen a "sex expression boom." In fact, such attempts in literary creation can be said to have fallen into a dilemma from the very beginning. The reasons are manifold. On one hand, it is related to the authors' lack of thorough understanding and insufficient creative practice. On the other hand, it is because sexology has been neglected for too long, and when "sex" is presented to people through aesthetics, it inevitably creates a sense of strangeness and mystery, appearing as a state of bewilderment that is hard to bear, thus giving rise to various doubts and criticisms. From the current situation, it can be seen that works that touch on sex have indeed become a hot topic. Regardless of whether "sex" is presented through aesthetics at a time of conflict between old and new ideas, or whether sexology itself is a sensitive issue, it will undoubtedly attract a great deal of attention. Whether it is those who worry about "sexual chaos" in China or those who have deep reflections on feudal asceticism, they will all pay close attention to this issue. Because "sex" involves many complex elements, and people's understanding of it varies greatly, it will inevitably bring many difficult-to-handle problems to the study and evaluation of works that touch on sex.

When presenting "sex," one should pay attention to moderation. Because humans have viewed sex as a hidden behavior that is not willing to be publicly displayed for at least two to three thousand years. Attempting to change customs and habits with a solid cultural and psychological foundation requires a lot of work. Relying solely on a batch of groundbreaking works is not realistic, and if not handled properly, it may even lead to the suppression of such works. Therefore, the presentation of sex in art should pay attention to a certain degree of moderation and consider the customs and habits that are still widely prevalent today. Undoubtedly, such considerations include a certain degree of accommodation to some false mentalities, but this accommodation is not without precedent. When dealing with similar issues, Engels once expressed a negative attitude towards the hypocritical shyness of German citizens on sex issues and held a positive attitude towards the natural and healthy depiction of flesh and desire by the proletarian poet Weitling. However, considering the habits of German workers at the time, he had to make temporary accommodations and suggested that the party's organ should not reprint the poet's works of this kind.

It is necessary to properly manage the contradiction between allowing works that touch on sex to exist and maintaining the physical and mental health of young people. Currently, the conflict between the two sides is quite sharp. When analyzing the causes of young people's sexual misconduct, in addition to severely criticizing the large-scale translation and publication of foreign pornographic novels, people often also direct their criticism towards some serious domestic works that touch on sex. Of course, the criticism of the latter is also not without grounds. Due to differences in physiological development stages, life experience, and interests, the actual impact of works that touch on sex on people of different levels is not the same. Some works that are considered completely normal by adults may have a stimulating effect on young people who are in the stage of sexual awakening and have a mysterious fascination with the opposite sex. This constitutes a contradiction between the demand for works that touch on sex by a considerable portion of adult readers and the potential sexual stimulation that such works may have on young people.

How to resolve this contradiction requires careful study. We can learn from the experience of Western countries, but many of their practices currently lack the necessary material foundation and spiritual preparation in our country. Western countries, on the one hand, advocate individual freedom, and on the other hand, are also concerned about the education and physical and mental health of young people. Therefore, they have adopted some compromising measures that take both sides into account, such as classifying films and restricting the screening of certain films to specific audiences, venues, and times, as well as restricting the sale of books and magazines that touch on sex, allowing only adults to purchase them. Even if we adopt these measures, there will still be some problems. There is no perfect solution in the world; there are advantages and disadvantages. As long as works that touch on sex have become a social demand, it is impossible to ban them. We can only strive to maximize the benefits and minimize the harm.

It is necessary to further explore and formulate standards for identifying obscene materials. In recent years, relevant departments have proposed general regulations on what constitutes obscene materials and formed rough identification standards. The academic community has also conducted some scholarly discussions, but further research and improvement are still needed.

The main difference between artworks and obscene materials lies in the fact that the former is about aesthetics, while the latter is about concrete descriptions of sexual behavior or blatant promotion of lascivious images. The former belongs to the creative achievements of human beings, aiming to create a new world and recreate human beings; the latter is a repetitive mentality and behavior, emphasizing and displaying sexual functions and sexual organs in great detail, with the main purpose of arousing people's sexual desires, and often with the intention of making a profit.

　　在当前文艺创作和审美欣赏中，“性”已经成为一个热门的话题。在描写性　的文学中，如何：
　　走出审美的困境
　　魏天祥
    “性”诉诸于审美，本非易事，加之我国很长一段时间视“性”为科学研究禁区，也就更其艰难。近年来随着探索之风盛行和西学东渐，性科学和性教育开始拓荒而耕，文艺创作也不失时机地推出了一批涉性作品。未开垦的土地，总是有着无穷的吸引力，以至一时间有人忽然发现中国文学出现了“性表现热”。事实上，文学创作所作的这种尝试，可以说一开始就陷入了困境。究其原因，一方面固然与作者的观念未至缜密且创作实践短缺有关，另一方面却因性科学被搁置得太久，荒废得太久，“性”诉诸于审美一旦呈现于人们面前，难免会产生一种陌生感、神秘感，表现出一种不大能承受的惶惑之状，以至生出种种疑虑和责难。从目前的情况来看，涉性作品确乎已成为时下一个热门话题。且不说“性”诉诸于审美，处在新旧观念冲突之际，单是性科学本身也就足以成为一个敏感问题。无论是担心中国会出现“性混乱”的人，还是对封建禁欲主义反思颇深的人，都会对此十分关注。由于“性”所涉及的东西极为复杂，人们的认识又甚为悬殊，势必给涉性作品的研究和评价带来许多不易把握的问题。
    在表现“性”时，应讲究一点分寸。因为人类把性视为一种隐蔽的、不愿公开展示的行为，少说已有二三千年的历史。企图改变有着雄厚文化心理基础的风俗习惯，要做许许多多的工作，光靠搞一批突破性的作品是不现实的，弄得不好，反而会招致这类作品的剪灭。所以，艺术中的性表现，应当讲究一定的分寸，虑及现时仍然广泛发生作用的风俗习惯。毫无疑问，这种考虑包涵着对某些虚假心态的迁就，但这种迁就并非是无例可循的。恩格斯当年在处理类似问题时，就曾一方面对德国市民在性问题上的虚伪的羞怯心表示否定态度而对无产阶级诗人维尔特表现自然、健康的肉感和肉欲的作品持肯定态度，但考虑到德国工人当时的习惯，又不得不作暂时迁就，并建议党的机关报不要转载诗人的这一类作品。
    须调控好允许涉性作品存在与维护青少年身心健康之间的矛盾。现在，两方面形成的冲突颇为尖锐。人们在分析青少年性罪错的原因时，除了严厉指责大量翻译出版外国色情小说外，往往也把矛头指向了国内的一些严肃的涉性作品。当然，对后者的指责也是不无根据的，由于生理发展阶段、生活经验、生活情趣的不同，涉性作品对不同层次的人产生的实际影响是不尽相同的。一些在成年人看来完全是正常的涉性作品，对处于性萌动和对异性怀有神秘感的青少年来说，却可能产生某种刺激作用。这就构成了成年读者中相当一部分人对涉性作品的需求与这类作品对青少年可能产生的性刺激二者之间的矛盾。
    如何调节这个矛盾，需要很好地研究。西方国家的经验我们可以借鉴，但他们的许多作法，目前在我国还缺乏必要的物质基础和精神准备。西方国家一方面要讲求个性自由，一方面也要为青少年的教育和身心健康担忧，于是他们采取了一些折衷的、两方面都兼顾的办法，如对影片实行分级，限定有些影片的放映对象、场所和时间，对涉性书刊实行限制销售，只准成年人购买等。我们即使采取这些办法，也仍然还会出现一些问题。世界上绝无万全之策，有利便有弊，只要涉性作品已构成一种社会需求，想禁是禁不住的。我们只能竭力使之利求其大而害求其小。
    须进一步探讨和制定淫秽物品的判别标准。这些年，有关部门对什么是淫秽物品已提出了一般性的规定，形成了大致的判别标准。评论界也作过一些学术性探讨，但仍然有待于进一步研究和完善。
    艺术品与淫秽物品的主要区别在于：前者是审美，后者则是具体描写性行为或露骨地宣传色情淫荡形象。前者属于人类的创造性劳动成果，为着创造新的世界和重新铸造人类自身；后者则是不断重复性的心态和行为，不厌其详地强调和展示性机能和性器官，目的主要是引起人们的性欲反映，而且制作者常以营利为目的。
