The New China News Agency reported from Montevideo on April 16th that the results of Uruguay's citizens' vote held on the 16th have been announced. The majority of votes were in favor of amnesty for military personnel who had committed human rights violations during the period of military rule.

    新华社蒙得维的亚４月１６日电　乌拉圭１６日举行的公民投票结果已经揭晓，多数票赞成赦免在军人统治时期曾经侵犯过人权的军人，据认为，这一结果有利于维护政府与军方之间的团结和政局的稳定。
    在１９７３至１９８５年军人执政期间，乌拉圭有１６４人因政治原因“失踪”，约５０００人被投入监狱。在此期间，涉嫌侵犯人权的军官约有２００人。
