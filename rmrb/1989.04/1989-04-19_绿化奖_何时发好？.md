To encourage afforestation, many places have established "Greening Awards." Establishing such awards is certainly acceptable, but if the timing of the awards is not handled properly, it may backfire. So, when is the best time to issue the "Greening Award"?

Based on past experience, some units often issue the awards right after tree planting is completed. This can result in those who should receive the award not getting it, while those who shouldn't receive it do. This is because assessing greening achievements involves not only looking at the quantity of trees planted but, more importantly, the survival rate. The survival rate of newly planted saplings cannot be determined in the same year. If awards are given based solely on the number of trees planted, it can easily lead to formalism in the work. Planting without proper management turns tree planting into merely planting "numbers."

Based on this, the author believes that the "Greening Award" can be issued a bit later, waiting until the following spring when the weather is warm and flowers are blooming, and then determining the award based on the survival rate of the saplings. This way, units or individuals who plant more trees, have better quality, and manage them effectively will have a better chance of becoming the recipients of the "Greening Award."

### “绿化奖”何时发好？

　　“绿化奖”何时发好？
　　汪贵林
    为鼓励植树造林，不少地方设立了“绿化奖”。设奖当然是可以的，但掌握不好发奖时机，也可能事与愿违。那么，“绿化奖”何时发好？
    按以往经验，一些单位往往把奖设在植树刚刚结束时，这就可能使该得奖的未得奖，不该得奖的却得了奖。因为考察绿化成绩，不但要看植树的数量，更重要的是看成活多少，而当年新栽的小树是无法统计成活率的。如果只按栽种数量发奖，就很容易促成工作中的形式主义。只种不管，植树就成了植“数”了。
    据此，笔者认为，“绿化奖”不妨晚一点发，等到第二年春暖花开时，视小树存活量而定。这样，栽得多、质量好而且管理得力的单位或个人，才更有可能成为“绿化奖”的得主。
