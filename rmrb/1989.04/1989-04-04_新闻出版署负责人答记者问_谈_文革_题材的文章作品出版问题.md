News and Publishing Bureau Chief Answers Reporters' Questions on the Publication of Articles and Works on the Cultural Revolution

New China News Agency, Beijing, April 3 — The News and Publishing Bureau Chief answered reporters' questions regarding the publication of articles and works on the Cultural Revolution.

Q: On December 23, 1988, the Shanghai *Lianhe Bao* published an article titled "The More Trials, the Deeper the Love — Wang Li Answers Questions While Ill" by Ye Yonglie, which sparked strong reactions. What is your view on this matter?

A: The disasters brought by the Cultural Revolution are still fresh in people's minds. Wang Li's attempt to glorify himself in his answers is wrong and unacceptable to the people. The readers' indignation is completely understandable. The *Lianhe Bao*'s publication of this article was inappropriate.

Q: Some articles, while criticizing "Wang Li Answers Questions While Ill," have raised the question of whether the history of the Cultural Revolution can be studied. What is your view on this?

A: The Cultural Revolution was a great disaster for the Chinese people. This period of history should be studied, and lessons should be scientifically summarized to avoid repeating past mistakes. In fact, research on this period has never stopped over the past decade. Important materials related to the Cultural Revolution should be carefully collected and organized. High-quality, valuable research articles and monographs that help people correctly draw lessons from history can be published. The current problem is that some works on the Cultural Revolution are eager to write about anecdotes, secrets, and inside stories of Lin Biao, Jiang Qing, and others, trivializing a serious political struggle. Some lack sufficient and accurate factual basis, are far-fetched, and easily draw incorrect conclusions. Such practices have negative social effects.

Q: What attitude should be taken towards the publication of articles and works related to the Cultural Revolution?

A: The "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China" has already provided a clear and principled conclusion on this period of history. Articles and works on this period should be based on the "Resolution," respect facts, and adopt a serious and cautious attitude. The publication of such articles and works should comply with relevant regulations. This approach ensures the necessary quality of articles and works and maintains political stability and unity.

　　新闻出版署负责人答记者问
    谈“文革”题材的文章作品出版问题
    新华社北京４月３日电  新闻出版署负责人就有关“文革”题材的文章、作品出版答记者问
    问：１９８８年１２月２３日，上海《联合时报》发表了由叶永烈所撰写的《越是多磨情越长——王力病中答客问》一文，引起强烈反应，你对此事怎么看？
    答：“文革”带来的灾难，人们记忆犹新。王力在答客问中美化自己，是错误的，是不能为人们所接受的。读者表示义愤是完全可以理解的。《联合时报》发表此文，是很不妥当的。
    问：有的文章在批评《王力病中答客问》一文时，曾提出“文革”这段历史能不能研究你是怎么看的？
    答：“文革”对我国人民来说是一场大灾难。这段历史应该研究，科学地总结教训，不忘前车之鉴。事实上十多年来对这段历史的研究从来没有中断过。对“文革”的重要资料要认真搜集整理，质量高、有价值、能帮助人们正确吸取历史经验的研究文章、专著可以发表和出版。现在的问题是，有些涉及“文革”的作品热衷于写林彪、江青等人的“轶事”、“秘闻”、“内幕”，将一场严肃的政治斗争庸俗化；有的则缺乏充分、准确的事实根据，牵强附会，轻易做出一些不正确的结论。这种做法，社会效果是不好的。
    问：你认为对有关“文革”的文章、著作的发表、出版，应持什么态度？
    答：《关于建国以来党的若干历史问题的决议》中，对“文革”这段历史已有原则性的明确结论。写这段历史的文章、作品，要以《决议》为依据，要尊重事实，持严肃慎重的态度。这类文章、著作的发表要遵守有关规定。这样做，是着眼于保证文章、著作的必要水平和保持政治上的安定团结。
