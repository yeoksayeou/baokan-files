Title: The Last Song of the Spring: The Release of a Collection of Shaman Ritual Songs
Author: Feng Wenchang
Date: 1989-04-11
Edition: 4

A collection of songs recording the ancient Manchu folk ancestral worship rituals, titled "Shamanic Spirit Songs Collection," has recently been released in Tieling, Liaoning Province. This collection was compiled by Mr. Wang Guoxing, who conducted extensive fieldwork in rural areas, and performed by Mr. Chen Junqing, a traditional singer of Shamanic ritual songs.

Shamanic spirit songs, with their primitive oral art form, have a long history in Northeast China and are the most representative of ancient folk ritual songs. Because they are oral art, they have not been documented in writing. This collection fills a gap in Chinese folk art.

The collection is a significant contribution to the preservation of Manchu cultural heritage and provides valuable insights into the rituals and beliefs of the Manchu people. The songs, with their unique melodies and lyrics, offer a glimpse into the rich cultural tapestry of Northeast China.

　　萨满崇先阳春绝唱
　　萨满教仪式歌专辑问世
    本报讯　一部记录满族古代民间祭祖仪式歌——《萨满神歌专辑》最近在辽宁省铁岭问世。该集是由王国兴先生深入农村搜集整理、萨满教仪式歌传人陈俊清老先生演唱的。
    萨满神歌以其原始口头艺术形式在我国东北地区源远流长，成为民间文艺古仪式歌中最有代表性的一种绝唱。正因其是口头艺术形式，所以一直没有文字。这本专辑，为我国民间文艺填补了空白。
