Syria announced on the 20th that Syrian troops will not withdraw from Lebanon until all issues in Lebanon are resolved.

Syrian Minister of Information Salman said, "When political reforms are achieved, a president is elected, and Israel withdraws from all Lebanese territory, there will be no need for Syrian troops to remain in Lebanon."

According to reports, Salman also said that Lebanon's Muslims demand equality and want Lebanon to be "part of the Arab world." "Only when these conditions are met," Salman said, "will Lebanon's problems be resolved."

　　叙宣布叙军不撤出黎巴嫩
    新华社北京４月２１日电  叙利亚２０日宣布，在黎巴嫩的所有问题得到解决之前，叙利亚军队决不撤出黎巴嫩。
    叙利亚新闻部长萨勒曼说，“当实现了政治改革，选出了总统，以色列撤出全部黎巴嫩领土的时候，叙利亚军队就没有必要呆在黎巴嫩了。”
    据报道，萨勒曼还说，黎巴嫩的穆斯林要求平等，要求黎巴嫩成为“阿拉伯的一部分”。“只有在这些条件实现之后”，萨勒曼说，“黎巴嫩的问题才能解决。”
    目前黎巴嫩约有４万叙利亚军队。他们支持黎巴嫩穆斯林在国家权力再分配中争取更大的份额的要求。
