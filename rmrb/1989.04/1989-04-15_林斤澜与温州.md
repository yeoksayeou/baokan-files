Last summer, during an evening, we heard that Lin Jinlian had returned to his hometown and was staying at the Leqing Leqian Hotel. Several of us young people immediately rushed over.

"Come in, come in," Lin Jinlian stood at the door, speaking in a thick Wenzhou accent, warmly welcoming us. His hearty laughter and easy-going manner made us feel completely at ease.

Just like his works, Lin Jinlian is full of vitality. He is enthusiastic and cheerful, witty in his speech. He blends so well with young people, so harmonious and intimate, without any pretension of a senior figure. When he learned that there were still some young people in Wenzhou diligently writing and studying, he was overjoyed, his enthusiasm unbridled. Forgetting the fatigue of his long journey, he spent the whole night talking with the young people. He talked about life, about his works, about the local customs and habits of his hometown, about the local dialect and idioms... It was already past 11 p.m., but he showed no sign of tiredness.

Lin Jinlian is very concerned about the development of his hometown. In the winter of 1983, he had come to Wenzhou with his wife. Originally, he planned to stay in Wenzhou for half a month and then return to Beijing. However, the unique and earthy atmosphere of Wenzhou, the charming shops, stalls, and carts, the husband-and-wife factories, father-and-son companies, the privately built houses, and the distinctive "model" all made him reluctant to leave.

Half a month passed, but he was still wandering the streets and alleys of Wenzhou, visiting both urban and rural areas, for more than two months. Only when his blood pressure rose and the doctor advised him to be hospitalized for a check-up did he reluctantly stop his interviews and "searches." But driven by his professional responsibilities and strong homesickness, he soon bounced back. Thus, "The Eel," "The Girl's Mother," "The Peddlers," "The Small Boat," "The Short-Bench Bridge's Female Mayor Li Dijing" ... one article after another emerged. In one year, he wrote more than 20 articles in the Wenzhou series.

Lin Jinlian has never stopped pursuing his writing. He often says, "I like to walk my own path, and I often look back at the path I have walked to choose the next step..."

This time, his trip to Wenzhou was as enthusiastic as ever. Besides giving lectures to literary enthusiasts, he spent every day with us, climbing mountains and crossing rivers, visiting revolutionary old areas to inquire about the hardships, and visiting prosperous towns to learn about the secrets of wealth. The land of his hometown was once again filled with his tireless footsteps. Soon, we will read his series of novels reflecting life in Wenzhou, won't we?

　　林斤澜与温州
　　刘瑞坤
    去年盛夏的一个黄昏，听说林斤澜又回到了家乡，住在乐清乐申宾馆，我们几个后生就立即跑去了。
    “请进来坐，我刚到你们就来看我，真难为你们了。”林斤澜站在门口，操着浓重的温州乡音热情地欢迎我们。他爽朗的笑声和随和的态度，使我们一点也不感到拘谨。
    就像他的作品一样，林斤澜浑身充满着勃勃生机。他热情爽朗，谈吐风趣。他和年轻人在一起，那么默契和谐，亲密无间，没有一点师长的架子。当他得知温州还有一帮后生在埋头“爬格子”，在坚忍地钻学问时，高兴得激情难抑，忘记了长途跋涉的疲劳，整夜地和年轻人交谈。他谈人生，谈作品，谈家乡民情风俗，谈疙里疙瘩的方言土语……深夜１１点多钟了，仍然没有一点倦意。
    林斤澜十分关心家乡建设。１９８３年初冬时节，他曾偕夫人来过温州。那次，他原打算在温州小住半个月就回北京，可后来，温州那种奇特而又充满乡土味的氛围，那迷人的店、摊、担，那夫妻厂、父子公司，那拔地而起的私人住宅，那别具一格的“模式”，竟使他流连忘返。
    半个多月过去了，他依然在温州串街走巷，跑了城里跑乡下，足足跑了两个多月，直到血压升高，医生要他住院“检查”时，他才依依不舍地停止了采访和“搜索”。但出于职业的繁感和强烈的思乡之情，回北京没多久，他又顽强地冲刺起来。于是，《溪鳗》、《丫头她妈》、《小贩们》、《舴艋船》、《矮凳桥的女镇长李地惊》……一篇篇地蹦出来了。一年来，他竟一发而不可收，一口气写了２０多篇温州系列。
    林斤澜从来没有停止过对创作的追求。他常对人说：“我喜欢走自己的路，我也经常回过着来看看自己走过的路，然后选择自己下一步该走的路……
    他这次温州之行，热情不减当年，除了给文学青年讲学之外，天天和我们一起，翻山越岭，四处奔波，到革命老区访贫问苦，到富裕集镇了解致富秘诀。故乡的土地上，又印满了他那奔波的足迹。不久的将来，我们又会读到他反映温州生活的系列小说了吧。
