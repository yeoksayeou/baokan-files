Title: Unwise Moves

On April 6, U.S. President Bush announced the extension of economic sanctions against Panama, a measure first imposed a year ago by President Reagan. The wisdom of this move is highly questionable.

Last April, the White House, in an effort to protect its strategic interests in Panama, tried to force the ouster of Manuel Noriega, the Panamanian Defense Forces commander who took a hard line on the canal zone issue. At the time, the U.S. sent troops to the canal zone for military exercises, continued to recognize Eric Delvalle, the deposed president, as the "legitimate head of state," and threatened economic sanctions. These interventions exacerbated Panama's political instability and strained U.S.-Panamanian relations. However, Panama stood firm against U.S. pressure, and Noriega remains in control of the situation.

President Bush has proclaimed the principle of "democratic self-determination" for Central America. What does "self-determination" mean? It means that the people of Central America should decide their own affairs, and that the problems of Panama should be resolved by the Panamanian people in their own way, without external interference. The U.S. now seeks to continue the failed policies of the previous administration to pressure Panama, which clearly contradicts the principles it has proclaimed.

Facing the U.S. decision to extend economic sanctions, the Panamanian government has stated that it will not change its stance. This move by the U.S. seems to be of no help to Panama's democratization process and instead hinders the improvement of U.S.-Panamanian relations, which is not beneficial to the U.S. either.

### 不高明的举动

　　不高明的举动
    美国总统布什４月６日，宣布延长一年前由里根总统采取的对巴拿马的经济制裁措施，这一举动是否高明大可怀疑。
    去年４月，白宫为了维护它在巴拿马的战略利益，竭力要把在运河区问题上持强硬态度的巴拿马国防军司令诺列加撵下台。一时间，又是往运河区调兵遣将搞军事演习，又是继续承认被巴拿马议会废黜的原总统德尔瓦列为“合法国家元首”，还挥舞起“经济制裁”的大棒。美国的干涉行动加剧了巴拿马政局的动荡，也使美巴关系十分紧张。但是，巴拿马顶住了美国的高压政策，至今诺列加仍然控制着巴拿马局势。
    布什总统曾经宣布要在中美洲实行“民主自决”的原则。何谓“自决”？那就是中美洲的事情由中美洲人民自己决定，巴拿马的问题应由巴拿马人民在没有外来干涉的情况下用自己的方式去解决。美国现在要继续上届政府的失败的政策来对巴拿马施加压力，显然是不符合美国自己宣布的原则的。
    面对美国延长经济制裁的决定，巴拿马政府已经表示不会因此改变自己的立场。美国这一举动看来不仅丝毫无助于巴拿马的民主化进程，还阻碍了美巴关系的改善，对美国也并不有利。
