China's microsurgery has reached a new international level with the successful completion of the first "free double latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap free fibula composite bridge cross transplantation" in Shanghai.

An 11-year-old boy from Heilongjiang, Nan Shifeng, had his left lower leg crushed by a train in October 1986, resulting in a large defect in the tibia and extensive skin loss. For more than two years, little Shifeng was bedridden, and his left leg faced the risk of amputation.

On March 21 of this year, orthopedic experts from Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital, including Director of Orthopedics Yu Zhongjia, Deputy Director He Huhao, and attending physician Tang Yisheng, along with four other medical professionals, performed a microsurgical transplant on Nan Shifeng. They removed the latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flaps with blood vessels from both of Shifeng's shoulders and transplanted them to the skin defect on his left lower leg. They also removed the fibula with blood vessels from his right leg and transplanted it to the tibia on his left lower leg. Additionally, they took a portion of the blood vessels from his right lower leg and grafted them onto his left lower leg, combining them with the blood vessels of the double latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap and the fibula into an independent vascular pedicle. The surgery lasted a total of 13 hours.

This surgery, designated as "free double latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap free fibula composite bridge cross transplantation," is unprecedented in the history of international microsurgery. Its success once again demonstrates that China's microsurgical technology is at the forefront of the world's advanced level. Prior to this, only a few countries had individual cases of "composite surgery with two free tissues."

　　首例高难移植术  上海医生已攻克    
    我显微外科超国际水平
    新华社上海４月２８日电（记者赵兰英、实习生朱丹）我国显微外科手术又创国际新水平，首例“游离双背阔肌肌皮瓣游离腓骨组合桥式交叉移植术”最近在上海成功。
    １１岁的黑龙江男孩南世峰，左小腿不幸于１９８６年１０月被火车碾轧，致使胫骨大块缺损、皮肤大面积缺损。两年多来，小世峰卧床不起，左腿面临截肢的危险。
    今年３月２１日，骨科专家、上海市第六人民医院骨科主任于仲嘉和副主任何鹤嗥、主治医生唐一声等６人为南世峰施行了显微移植手术。他们取下小世峰左右肩背部带血管的阔肌肌皮瓣，移植到左小腿皮肤缺损处；又取下右腿带血管的腓骨，移植到左小腿胫骨上，再将他的右小腿血管取出一部分，架接在左小腿，使其与双背阔肌肌皮血管和腓骨血管组合成一个独立的血管蒂。手术整整进行了１３个小时。
    这次被定为“游离双背阔肌肌皮瓣游离腓骨组合桥式交叉移植”的手术，在国际显外科史上绝无仅有。它的成功，再一次表明，我国显微外科技术领先世界先进水平。在此之前，只有几个国家有个别“两块游离组织的组合手术”病例。
