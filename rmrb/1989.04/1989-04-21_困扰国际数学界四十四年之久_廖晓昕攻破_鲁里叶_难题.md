A problem that has puzzled the international mathematical community for 44 years has recently been solved by Professor Xiao-Xin Liao of the Mathematics Department at Huazhong Normal University.

Lyapunov was a famous Soviet control theorist. In 1944, while researching the automatic pilot system for airplanes, he proposed the concept of absolute stability in system mathematics but was unable to solve the necessary and sufficient conditions for absolute stability. Due to the significant theoretical and practical value of solving this problem, it became known as the "Lyapunov problem" and attracted the attention of many mathematicians, mechanists, control theorists, and engineers from around the world.

This year, 51-year-old Professor Liao began his research in this area in 1978. In June 1985, he presented a paper titled "On the Absolute Stability of Lyapunov-Type Direct Control Systems" at the Seventh International Conference on the Mathematical Theory of Networks and Systems in Sweden, which aroused great interest and attention from the attendees.

Based on a series of research achievements in mathematical theory and applications of stability, Liao used various ingenious transformation methods to simplify the original complex variables and unseparated systems into simple variable-separated systems, forming a new concept of partial variable absolute stability. Recently, in his research, he successively obtained the necessary and sufficient conditions for the absolute stability of Lyapunov direct control systems, indirect control systems, discrete control systems, and time-delay control systems. Thus, he has theoretically solved the famous mathematical problem that has remained unresolved for over 40 years—the "Lyapunov problem."

　　困扰国际数学界四十四年之久    
    廖晓昕攻破“鲁里叶”难题
    新华社武汉４月２１日电（实习生方明、记者罗辉）困扰国际数学界４４年之久的“鲁里叶”难题最近被华中师范大学数学系廖晓昕教授攻破。
    鲁里叶是苏联著名控制论专家。１９４４年，他在对飞机自动驾驶仪的研究中提出了系统数学中有关绝对稳定性概念，但他却无法破解其绝对稳定的充要条件。由于解决这个问题具有重大理论意义和实际价值，因此被称为“鲁里叶问题”，而且吸引了全世界许多数学家、力学家、控制论专家和工程师的注意。
    今年５１岁的廖晓昕教授，于１９７８年开始这方面的研究。１９８５年６月，他在瑞典第七届国际网络与系统的数学理论会议上，宣读了题为《论鲁里叶型直接控制系统的绝对稳定性》的论文，引起了与会者的很大兴趣和关注。
    在已取得的稳定性数学理论与应用方面一系列研究成果的基础上，廖晓昕采取诸多巧妙的变换方式，将原复杂的变量和未分离的系统化为简单的变量分离系统后，形成了关于部分变元绝对稳定的新概念。最近，他在研究中先后欣喜地得到了鲁里叶直接控制系统、间接控制系统、离散控制系统、时滞控制系统绝对稳定的充要条件，从而在理论上彻底解决了４０多年来悬而未决的著名数学难题——“鲁里叶问题”。
