Concentrating on economic rectification and structural adjustment is the first part of the content of the government work report delivered by Premier Li Peng at the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress. It is a requirement put forward by the State Council for all levels of government and departments to stabilize the economy and deepen reforms.

The phrase "concentrating on" means not being distracted or half-hearted, and certainly not insincere. To truly concentrate, the most important thing is for the entire nation to be united in recognizing the severity of the situation we face. Only with a unified understanding can we proceed in a coordinated manner. Why has progress been less than ideal in the past half year in areas such as reducing investment scale, controlling consumption demand, adjusting economic structure, and rectifying circulation order? Why have some places and departments been slow to implement the rectification measures, and why have some even taken various steps to protect local interests? The key issue is that some comrades do not fully recognize the severity of the current economic situation and do not deeply understand why rectification and adjustment are necessary.

Some comrades harbor a sense of complacency, believing that from 1985 to 1987, there were several calls for tightening, but since no tightening occurred, we managed to get through it. These comrades fail to see that the situation this time is significantly different from previous years, with the most crucial difference being the degree of inflation. In previous years, although prices rose, the increase was only 6-8%, which was bearable for the people, enterprises, and the state. Last year, the price increase reached 18.5%, far exceeding the tolerance of the people, enterprises, and the state. Additionally, the country's foreign exchange reserves and important material and commodity inventories have significantly decreased, and the supply-demand gap continues to widen. The state's debt burden is becoming heavier, and the peak repayment period for both domestic and foreign debts is approaching. If some contradictions could be temporarily postponed and endured in previous years, now there is little room to delay, and no matter how we endure, we cannot get through it. If this round of rectification and adjustment fails, inflation will worsen, leading to more serious economic and political consequences. Successfully implementing the rectification and adjustment is the only viable path for China's economy to overcome the current difficulties. This point has been increasingly recognized by more people.

Of course, the rectification and adjustment will encounter many difficulties and new problems. Slowing down economic growth, reducing construction scale, and increasing unemployment will all have certain costs. Projects that have already started will suffer some losses, and the living standards of some urban and rural residents will decline. These costs must be paid. If we are not willing to pay them now and still hope to endure, the difficulties will only increase, and the costs will be even higher.

There is a sentiment that the success of the rectification and adjustment depends entirely on the Central Committee and the State Council. This view, if not wrong, is at least incomplete. If the Central Committee and the State Council had not made timely and correct decisions based on the national situation, the responsibility would indeed lie with them. However, the current situation is that the policy of rectification and adjustment and deepening reforms was decided at the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, and the specific measures for rectification and adjustment were proposed by the State Council long ago. Practice has proven their correctness, and they have been approved by this session of the National People's Congress. Therefore, whether the rectification and adjustment can achieve the expected results mainly depends on whether the comrades at all levels of government and departments are concentrating on and strictly implementing the policies and measures of the Central Committee and the State Council.

　　一心一意进行治理整顿
　　本报评论员
    一心一意进行治理整顿，是李鹏总理在七届人大二次会议上的政府工作报告第一部分的内容，是国务院为稳定经济、深化改革对各级政府、各部门的负责人提出的要求。
    所谓一心一意，就是不能三心二意，更不能虚情假意。要做到一心一意，最重要的是全国一条心，对我们面临的严峻形势有一致的认识。认识统一才能步调一致。为什么半年来在压缩投资规模、控制消费需求、调整经济结构和整顿流通秩序等方面，进展不大理想？为什么有些地方、部门对治理整顿的措施贯彻不力，有的甚至采取种种对策保护局部利益？关键是有些同志对当前经济形势的严峻认识不够，对为什么非要治理整顿不可的理解不深。
    有的同志存在一种侥幸心理，认为从1985年到1987年曾几次提出要紧缩，结果没有紧缩，不是也挺过来了吗？这些同志没有看到，这次调整面临的情况和前几年的有很大不同，最主要的是通货膨胀的程度不同。前几年物价虽然上涨，但幅度只有6—8％，群众、企业、国家都能够承受。去年物价上涨幅度达到18.5％，远远超过了群众、企业和国家的承受能力。还有现在国家外汇结存和重要物资及商品库存明显减少，供需差额不断扩大；国家债务负担越来越重，很快将进入偿还内外债高峰期。如果说前几年有些矛盾还勉强可以往后拖一拖，挺一挺还可以过来的话，那么现在拖的余地已经不大了，怎么样挺也挺不过来了。这次治理整顿搞不好，通货膨胀继续加剧，经济上、政治上都将出现更为严重的后果。搞好治理整顿，是我国经济走出目前困境的唯一可以选择的出路。这一点，已经为越来越多的人看清了。
    当然，治理整顿会遇到不少困难，会出现许多新问题。降低经济发展速度，压缩基建规模，失业人口会增加，已经开工的基建项目停下来会受一点损失，一部分城乡居民的生活水平要降低，等等。这一定的代价是要付的。现在不愿付，还想挺一挺，只能是越挺困难越大，要付的代价越大。
    现在有这么一种情绪，认为治理整顿能否贯彻下去，全看中央、国务院。这种看法如果不说是错的话，那至少是不全面的。如果党中央、国务院没有根据全国的情况及时作出正确的决策，责任当然在党中央、国务院。现在的情况是，治理整顿、深化改革的方针，党的十三届三中全会就决定了，治理整顿的政策、措施，国务院早就提出来了，实践证明是正确的，又经过了这次人大批准。因此，治理整顿能否取得预期效果，主要就看各级政府、各个部门的同志是否一心一意地、不折不扣地贯彻执行党中央、国务院的方针、政策和措施了。
