On March 23, this newspaper published Liu Zhenbang's article "Questioning the 'Grain is the Foundation of the Foundation'" which raised doubts about the idea that "grain is the foundation of the foundation." The following article presents a different view. Lu Liangshu and others believe: grain is the foundation for improving the food structure of the Chinese people, and it is also the foundation for increasing animal-based food; fluctuations in grain production are the fundamental constraints on the fluctuations in agriculture and the entire national economy; the national conditions of China determine that the development of animal husbandry mainly relies on grain production, and we cannot simply follow the practices of Western Europe.

The Foundation Position of Grain is Unshakable

Lu Liangshu Liu Zhicheng Jiang Jianping Mei Fangquan

Treating agriculture as the foundation of the national economy, and placing grain in the first position of the foundation industry, this industrial policy has been proven by the long-term economic and social development of China, and will not undergo fundamental changes in the relatively long historical period in the future. Stabilizing grain production means stabilizing agriculture, and thus stabilizing the overall development of the national economy.

Grain is the foundation of the foundation, determined by China's national conditions

Grain is the foundation for improving the food structure of the Chinese people, and it is also the foundation for increasing animal-based food. Most of China's animal-based food comes from agricultural areas, and it basically relies on the growth of feed grain. Currently, 95% of meat comes from agricultural areas, with only 5% from pastoral areas. In 1986, 84% of freshwater products came from aquaculture, and to a large extent, these are products converted from feed grain. In the dietary structure of the Chinese people, the heat energy provided by cereal grains accounts for 75% of the total heat energy, while animal-based food provides only 8% of the heat energy, and animal-based protein accounts for only 12%. From the historical development process, grain has always been the material foundation for the growth of China's animal husbandry, promoting or constraining the development of China's agriculture. From 1957 to 1978, over a period of 21 years, China's per capita grain remained around 300 kilograms, with almost no capacity to provide dedicated feed grain. Per capita meat production increased from 6.3 kilograms to 9 kilograms, an average annual increase of only 0.13 kilograms, with little change in the dietary structure. From 1978 to 1986, per capita grain availability quickly rose to 391 kilograms, and per capita consumption of meat, poultry, eggs, and aquatic products increased from 14.4 kilograms to 28.4 kilograms. Statistically, feed grain increased from over 30 billion kilograms to 74.3 billion kilograms, with both increasing by about 100%. During the same period, the proportion of feed grain in the total grain output increased from 12% to nearly 20%. According to predictions, by the end of the century, China's per capita grain availability will reach 400-425 kilograms, and the proportion of feed grain will rise to nearly 30%. In terms of per capita animal-based food availability, meat will reach 25 kilograms, with the pastoral areas still only accounting for 5% of the total meat supply. Eggs will be 12 kilograms, milk 15 kilograms, and aquatic products 15 kilograms. The food structure of the people will be significantly improved, basically reaching a moderately prosperous level. All of this requires a significant increase in grain production.

Fluctuations in grain production are the fundamental constraints on the fluctuations in China's agriculture and the entire national economy. Over the past nearly 40 years since the founding of the nation, the multiple fluctuations in China's grain production have shown its foundational role. Whenever grain production declines and stagnates, the period of declining agricultural growth rates is generally when adjustment or austerity policies are forced to be implemented. Conversely, whenever grain production increases significantly, it is generally a period of rapid growth in agriculture and the entire national economy. Thus, two very regular cycles have repeatedly occurred: one is the cycle of "grain shortage—adjustment—growth—investment bias towards non-agricultural industries and price distortions—grain shortage"; the other is the cycle of "agricultural stagnation—economic adjustment—agricultural rise—heavy industry bias development—agricultural stagnation." History and reality both remind us that the foundational role of grain cannot be ignored.

Placing the dairy industry in the first position of agriculture is not practical

China's national conditions determine that the development of animal husbandry mainly relies on grain production. Animal husbandry will have a relatively rapid development, and the proportion of feed crops will also have a corresponding increase for a period of time. However, in a relatively long historical period, it is not possible to take the path of animal husbandry as the main industry, nor can we mechanically copy the practices of Western Europe, using 2/3 of the agricultural land to grow grass and raise dairy cows to replace the foundational position of grain.

China's grasslands total 4.8 billion mu, with 3.4 billion mu available for use. However, most of them are located in arid, semi-arid, and short frost-free periods, with only 600 million mu of grassland in the semi-humid region with an annual rainfall of 400-800 millimeters. Currently, overgrazed grasslands still account for 1/3. The unit area yield of grass is only 1/10 of that in Western Europe. Developing and utilizing the grassy mountains and slopes in the south is difficult, requiring a large amount of capital and material-technical investment, which the national strength cannot bear for the time being. According to predictions, by the end of the century, even with efforts, the meat production in pastoral areas can only double the current level, with the national per capita increase of 1 kilogram of meat, still only accounting for 5% of the total meat production at that time. Therefore, by the end of the century, the increase in animal-based food will still be mainly in agricultural areas, and agricultural areas will still mainly rely on grain and some feed crops.

Western Europe's developed animal husbandry is based on a per capita grain production of over 750 kilograms. Western Europe has unique agricultural natural resources and strong economic strength. Its grasslands are located in temperate, humid, and rainy regions. Taking France as an example, in 1985, France had 4.9 mu of arable land per capita and 3.5 mu of pastureland; China had 1.4 mu of arable land per capita and 3.1 mu of grassland that needs to be developed and improved, and most of the grassland is distributed in sparsely populated arid and semi-arid regions. France produced 1,030 kilograms of grain per capita (excluding beans and tubers), with a grain yield of 380 kilograms per mu; China produced 363 kilograms of grain per capita, with a grain yield of 232 kilograms per mu. France's grain yield is 64% higher than China's, and more importantly, the per capita availability is nearly double. If France did not have 1,000 kilograms of grain per capita, it would not have the corresponding animal-based food. From the perspective of improving the food structure of different types of countries in the world, it is generally based on the growth of grain production. Generally, low-income developing countries have a per capita grain availability of less than 350 kilograms, with the proportion of feed grain being less than 20%. Middle-income countries have a per capita grain availability of 400-700 kilograms, with the proportion of feed grain being around 30%. Developed countries in Europe and America have a per capita grain consumption of over 750 kilograms, with the proportion of feed grain being around 60%. All of this shows that the development of animal husbandry is based on grain.

A per capita grain availability of 400 kilograms is an unshakable strategic goal. By the end of the century, to ensure the necessary supply of grain, we must continue to implement the policy of not relaxing grain production and actively developing diversified operations. While ensuring the continuous and stable growth of grain, we will adjust the crop structure, gradually shifting from a binary structure of grain and economic crops to a ternary structure of grain-feed-economic crops in coordination, and the integration of agriculture and animal husbandry. While fully playing the foundational role of grain, we will face the entire territory, actively develop and utilize all available food resources, vigorously develop the vast hilly, mountainous, grassland, and water areas, and thus adjust the production and consumption structure of food, achieving the goal of moderately prosperous development.

### 粮食的基础地位不可动摇

专栏：怎样突破徘徊？——农业发展问题讨论

    ３月２３日本版刊登的刘振邦《粮食基础说质疑》一文，对“粮食是基础的基础”提出疑义。这里发表的是不同意刘文观点的文章。卢良恕等同志认为：粮食是我国食物结构改善的基础，也是增加动物性食品的基础；粮食波动是农业乃至整个国民经济波动的基本制约因素；我国国情决定了畜牧业的发展主要依赖于粮食生产，不能照搬西欧的做法。
　　粮食的基础地位不可动摇
　　卢良恕　刘志澄　蒋建平　梅方权
    把农业作为国民经济的基础产业，把粮食摆在基础产业的第一位，这一产业政策的科学性已为我国经济、社会长期发展的实践所证实，而且在今后较长的历史时期内也不会出现根本性变化。稳住了粮食，就能稳住农业，也就能稳住国民经济发展的全局。
    　　　　粮食是基础的基础是我国国情决定的
    粮食是我国人民食物结构改善的基础，也是增加动物性食品的基础。我国主要动物性食品大部分来自农区，基本上依靠饲料粮食的增长。目前，肉食结构中９５％来自农区，牧区仅占５％。１９８６年淡水产品中，８４％来自人工养殖，在相当大程度上，这些都是饲料粮转化的产物。我国人民膳食结构中，仅谷类粮食所提供的热能就占到总热能的７５％，动物性食品所提供的热能仅占８％，动物性蛋白质比重仅占１２％。从发展的历史过程考察，粮食始终是我国畜牧业增长的物质基础，促进或制约着我国农业的发展。１９５７年到１９７８年的２１年间，我国人均粮食长期徘徊在３００公斤左右，基本上没有能力提供专用饲料粮，人均肉类产量由６．３公斤缓慢地上升到９公斤，每年平均仅增加０．１３公斤，人民膳食结构变化很小。１９７８年到１９８６年，人均粮食占有量迅速上升到３９１公斤，人均肉、禽、蛋和水产品消费量由１４．４公斤迅速上升到２８．４公斤，可统计的饲料粮则由３００多亿公斤上升到７４３亿公斤，两者同步增加了１倍。同期饲料粮占粮食总产量的比重由１２％上升到近２０％。根据预测到本世纪末，我国人均粮食占有量将达到４００—４２５公斤，饲料粮所占比重将上升到接近３０％。按人平均的动物性食品占有量，肉类将达到２５公斤，而草原牧区仍然只能占肉类供给总量的５％，蛋类１２公斤、奶类１５公斤，水产品１５公斤。人民的食物结构将有明显的改善，基本达到小康水平。这都需要大力增加粮食生产。
    粮食的波动是我国农业乃至整个国民经济波动的基本制约因素。建国近４０年来，我国粮食生产出现的多次波动已经显示出它的基础作用。凡是粮食生产下降徘徊的时期，农业增长率下降的阶段，一般就是被迫开始采取调整或紧缩政策的时期。反之，凡是粮食大幅度增长之后的年份，一般都是农业和整个国民经济迅速增长的时期。以致两个很有规律的循环多次出现：一是“粮食短缺——调整——增长——投资向非农产业偏斜和价格扭曲——粮食短缺”的循环；二是“农业停滞徘徊——经济调整——农业上升——重工业偏斜发展——农业停滞徘徊”的循环；历史和现实都告诫我们，粮食的这一基础作用不容忽视。
    　　　　把奶牛业放在农业的首位不切合实际
    我国的国情决定了畜牧业的发展主要依赖于粮食生产。畜牧业将有一个较快的发展，饲料作物的比重，也将有一段相应的增长，但在相当长的历史时期内不可能走上以畜牧业为主的道路，也不能生搬硬套西欧的道路，以２／３的农用地种草养奶牛来替代粮食的基础地位。
    我国的草原虽有４８亿亩，可利用的有３４亿亩。但大部分处于干旱、半干旱、无霜期短的地带，只有６亿多亩草地处于年降水量４００—８００毫米的半湿润地带。目前超载过牧的草地仍然占１／３。单位面积产草量仅及西欧的１／１０。开发、利用南方草山草坡难度很大，需要大量的资金和物质技术投入，国力一时难以承受。据预测分析，到本世纪末，即使作出努力，牧区肉产量也只能比现在增加２倍，全国人均增加１公斤肉，仍然只能占当时全国肉类总产量的５％。因此，到本世纪末增产动物性食品仍然基本在农区，农区仍然主要依靠粮食和部分饲料作物。
    西欧发达的畜牧业是以人均７５０公斤以上的粮食为基础的。西欧有得天独厚的农业自然资源和雄厚的经济实力。其草地位于气候温和湿润、终年有雨的地带。以法国作为比较，１９８５年，法国人均耕地４．９亩，牧草地３．５亩；中国人均耕地１．４亩，可开发利用有待大力改良的草地３．１亩，而且草地大多分布在人烟稀少的干旱、半干旱地带。法国人均生产谷物１０３０公斤（不包括豆类和薯类），谷物亩产量３８０公斤；我国人均粮食３６３公斤，粮食亩产量２３２公斤。法国粮食不仅亩产量高出我国６４％，更重要的是人均占有量多出近两倍。如果法国没有人均１０００公斤谷物，就不会有相应的动物性食品。从世界不同类型国家食物结构的改善来看，大都是以粮食生产的增长为基础的。一般低收入的发展中国家，人均粮食占有量都在３５０公斤以下，饲料粮所占比重在２０％以下。中等收入国家人均粮食占有量为４００—７００公斤，饲料粮比重为３０％左右。欧美发达国家人均粮食消费总量达到７５０公斤以上，饲料粮比重６０％左右。这些都说明，畜牧业的发展是以粮食为基础的。
    人均４００公斤粮食必不可少是不可动摇的战略目标。到本世纪末，为了保证粮食必需的供给能力，要继续实行决不放松粮食生产，积极发展多种经营的方针。在保证粮食持续稳定增长的同时，调整种植业结构，逐步由粮食和经济作物为主的二元结构向粮食——饲料——经济作物协调发展、农牧业相结合的三元结构转变。在充分发挥粮食基础作用的同时，面向整个国土，积极开发利用一切可以利用的食物资源，大力开发广阔的丘陵、山地、草地和水域，进而调整食物的生产结构和消费结构，实现小康水平的发展目标。
