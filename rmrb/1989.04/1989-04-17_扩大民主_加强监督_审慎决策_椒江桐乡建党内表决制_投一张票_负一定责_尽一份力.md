	Expanding Democracy, Strengthening Supervision, and Making Prudent Decisions
	Jianjiang and Tongxiang Establish Party Internal Voting System
	One Vote, One Responsibility, One Effort

	The People's Daily reports: In response to the Thirteenth National Congress's call to "establish and improve relevant rules of procedure and voting systems," the Jianjiang Municipal Party Committee and Tongxiang County Party Committee in Zhejiang Province have successively established a voting system for discussing important issues at Party Committee meetings.

	These two Party Committees have stipulated that the following matters must undergo voting: specific implementation plans for major decisions of the Central Committee and higher-level Party organizations; principles for ensuring the implementation of State Council and higher-level government directives in the city (county); medium- and long-term development plans, annual plans, and major reform plans; major decisions on Party building, political and legal affairs, united front work, and mass organizations in the region; appointments, dismissals, rewards, and punishments of cadres, and recommendations for appointments.

	Voting can be conducted through oral, show of hands, named voting, and anonymous voting, with a majority of more than half of those present required for a motion to pass.

	Tongxiang County Party Committee has further specified: for major decisions on political, economic, cultural, and social development of the entire county, major deployments for reform, and major issues concerning the Party's own construction, named voting should be conducted; for Party elections and important personnel arrangements, anonymous voting should be conducted; for other issues, a show of hands should be used.

	If there is a dispute over an important issue during the discussion and the numbers are roughly equal, the Jianjiang Municipal Party Committee and Tongxiang County Party Committee, in accordance with the amendments to certain articles of the Thirteenth National Congress Party Constitution, will, except in emergency situations, postpone the vote, conduct further investigation and research, and then vote again, or in special circumstances, report to higher-level Party organizations for adjudication. Unlike other places, Tongxiang County Party Committee stipulates that if the Standing Committee cannot reach a consensus, it can be submitted to the full Committee for voting; Jianjiang Municipal Party Committee stipulates that if the full Committee cannot reach a consensus, it can be submitted to the Party Congress for voting, fully embodying the principle of Party democracy where the Standing Committee is responsible to the full Committee, and the full Committee is responsible to the Party Congress.

	The implementation of the Party internal voting system in Jianjiang and Tongxiang County has only been in place for four to five months, but it has already played a certain role in expanding Party democracy, strengthening Party supervision, and improving the level of decision-making. In February this year, during the discussion of the 1989 work arrangements, the Tongxiang County Party Committee's full Committee conducted named voting in accordance with the voting rules. The committee members cherished their votes, discussed seriously, actively proposed amendments, and demanded that the Standing Committee respond to the committee members' opinions before voting. This situation was unprecedented. Some county committee members reflected that in the past, they only saw the county committee as the secretary and the standing committee, and although they were members of the county committee, they often complained about and criticized the county committee's work. Now, by signing their names to vote in favor of the county committee's work arrangements, they must indeed take responsibility.

　　扩大民主　加强监督　审慎决策
　　椒江桐乡建党内表决制
　　投一张票　负一定责　尽一份力
    本报讯　浙江省椒江市委、桐乡县委根据十三大提出的“建立和完善有关的议事规则、表决制度”的要求，相继建立党委会讨论重要问题时的表决制度。
    这两个党委规定，在讨论决定以下内容时必须进行表决：贯彻中央和上级党组织重大决议的具体实施方案；保证国务院和上级政府指示在本市（县）实施的原则意见；中长期发展规划、年度计划和重大改革方案；本地区党的建设、政法、统战、群团工作中的重大决定；干部的任免、奖惩和推荐建议。表决采用口头、举手、记名投票和无记名投票四种形式，以超过应到人数的半数赞同为通过。
    桐乡县委还具体规定：对有关全县政治、经济、文化、社会发展的重大决策，改革的重大部署，党的自身建设的重大问题，进行记名投票；对党内选举和重要人事安排的推荐提名，进行无记名投票；对其他问题，举手表决。
    如果在讨论中对重要问题发生争论，且双方人数接近，椒江市委、桐乡县委根据十三大党章部分条文修正案的规定，除紧急情况外暂缓表决，进一步调查研究后复议表决，或在特殊情况下报请上级党组织裁决。与其他地方不同的是，桐乡县委规定，如常委会争执不下，可提请全委会表决；椒江市委规定，如全委会争执不下，可提请党代会表决，以充分体现常委会向全委会负责、全委会向党代会负责的党内民主原则。
    椒江和桐乡县实行党内表决制度只有四五个月时间，但在扩大党内民主、加强党内监督、提高决策水平方面已发挥一定作用。今年２月，桐乡县委全委会讨论１９８９年工作安排时，按照表决规则实行了记名投票。委员们十分珍惜自己的一票，认真讨论，积极提出修改意见，并要求常委对委员提出的意见答复后再投票表决。这种情况是过去所没有的。一些县委委员反映，过去把县委只看作是书记、常委，自己虽是县委成员，还常常抱怨、指责县委工作。现在自己署名投票赞成县委工作安排，就要确实负起责任。　　　　（黄海）
