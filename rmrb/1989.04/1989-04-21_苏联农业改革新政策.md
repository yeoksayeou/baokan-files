Soviet agriculture can be described as a long-standing "difficult problem." The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) held a plenary session in March this year to specifically discuss agricultural issues, summarize historical lessons, and formulate a fundamental policy to overhaul agriculture. The core of this policy is to change rural economic relations, expand the production and management autonomy of agricultural workers, and make them the masters of the land again. The goal is to alleviate the tension in food supply within the next two years and solve the food supply problem by 1995.

Reforming Agricultural Production Relations

Over the 70-plus years since the founding of the Soviet Union, the grain problem has not been fundamentally solved. Last year's grain production was only 194 million tons, regressing to the level of 10 years ago. The market supply of meat and other foodstuffs is tight, necessitating large-scale imports of grains, meat, vegetables, sugar, and vegetable oil from abroad. Gorbachev recently stated that if the food problem cannot be solved, "it could undermine the reforms and cause social unrest." This shows the urgency of solving the agricultural problem.

In the past 20 years, Soviet agricultural investment has accounted for more than 27% of the total national economic investment, a significant amount, but the returns have been minimal. In recent years, through reflection on the path taken, Soviet leaders have realized that the main reason for agricultural backwardness is the irrational rural economic relations, neglect of farmers' interests, and failure to mobilize their enthusiasm for management and operation, leading to a "disconnection between people and land, and production materials." Therefore, it is proposed that the way out for solving the agricultural problem lies in "fundamentally reforming rural economic relations," expanding farmers' production and management autonomy, and liberating agricultural productivity.

Promoting Leasehold System Widely

The CPSU proposed that the concept of ownership must be changed, recognizing that various forms of socialist ownership of production materials have equal rights, and allowing farmers to cooperate closely in various forms of operation. The widespread implementation of the leasehold system is the main way to change rural economic relations. Gorbachev emphasized at the Central Committee plenary session that developing rural leasehold relations is one of the most important and decisive ways to reform socialist ownership relations at this stage. Through leasing, the enthusiasm and creativity of workers can be fully mobilized.

For a long time, the Soviet Union has focused on strengthening agriculture through material and technological means, without considering the necessity of improving production relations, thus turning farmers "from masters of the land into day laborers." This plenary session seeks problems and solutions within economic relations. The meeting believes that the leasehold contract form can solve the phenomenon of farmers being disconnected from land and other production materials, combining workers with production materials, making them true masters, and thus making the most effective use of land and production materials. The lease term can be up to 50 years, which can make farmers confidently increase their investment in land.

Currently, more than 10,000 state farms in the Soviet Union have adopted the leasehold contract form, accounting for about 1/5 of the total number of state farms in the Soviet Union. The truly contracted collectives have achieved high efficiency, where the grain yield per hectare is 1,000 to 1,500 kilograms higher than that of ordinary state farms, and the milk yield per cow is at least 500 to 600 kilograms higher.

The new Soviet agricultural policy also includes reforming the agricultural management system, further expanding operational autonomy, and reorganizing agricultural and industrial leadership at all levels from top to bottom. The general starting point of the institutional reform is to achieve democratic management, with producers being completely autonomous, with no fixed forms, and adapting to local conditions. In addition, efforts are being made from multiple angles to accelerate the social transformation of rural areas, improve production and living conditions, and reverse the trend of large-scale personnel outflow, so that farmers can stay on the land.

This time, the Soviet Union formulated a new agricultural reform policy after reviewing the history of agricultural development. Soviet theorists believe that Lenin attached great importance to the alliance between workers and peasants. After the October Revolution, the Soviet government immediately promulgated the land law, allowing the vast majority of peasants to obtain the land they relied on for survival. During the period of implementing the New Economic Policy, the grain tax was implemented to replace the surplus grain collection system, limiting the amount of products collected from peasant households, allowing free buying and selling of land, allowing land leasing, and using a certain amount of hired labor, and widely developing the cooperative movement. This policy mobilized the enthusiasm of the peasants, and by 1925, many agricultural production indicators had already recovered to the level before World War I. However, due to the implementation of comprehensive collectivization, in the late 1920s and 1930s, collective farms were forcibly organized, making the production relations surpass the level of productive forces development, violating Lenin's principles, and causing great damage to agriculture. In 1954, the CPSU Central Committee took a series of major measures to strengthen agriculture, especially the reclamation of wasteland, which increased agricultural production. By the early 1960s, about 42 million hectares of wasteland had been reclaimed, increasing the total cultivated land area in the Soviet Union by 1/5, and grain production also increased, but the grain problem was not fundamentally solved.

The CPSU Central Committee plenary session was prepared carefully and thoroughly, identifying the root cause of Soviet agricultural backwardness. This reform can be said to be the most profound among all agricultural reforms since the New Economic Policy.

There Are Obstacles to Implementing the New Policy

Firstly, the views of leaders at all levels are not entirely consistent. Soviet people believe that for a long time, agriculture has been plagued by bureaucratic systems, and the leaders of state farms and collective farms can no longer enjoy their privileges, and in the future, only those with achievements will be rewarded. Secondly, currently, backward and even some medium-sized collective farm peasants are not very concerned about the new system, and some peasants are willing to continue with egalitarianism and eat from the "big pot." The conservative thinking of some leading cadres also seriously affects the widespread promotion of the leasehold contract form in agriculture.

Gorbachev recently emphasized that "for the first time in many years, the plenary session has placed the fundamental change in ownership relations, rural production relations, the transition to new forms of operation, and the fundamental change in management methods in an important position in the decision on economic issues." This has "exceeded the scope of agricultural issues and has extremely important theoretical, political, and economic significance." In short, the major turning point in Soviet agricultural policy has begun, and the success or failure of agricultural reform is related to the success or failure of the entire economic reform in the Soviet Union.

　　苏联农业改革新政策
    方荣萱
    苏联的农业可说是一个“老大难”的问题了。苏共中央在今年３月召开全会，专门讨论农业问题，总结历史教训，并制定出一项根本改造农业的政策，其核心是改变农村经济关系，扩大农业劳动者的生产经营自主权，使他们重新成为土地的主人，以便在最近两年内缓解食品问题的紧张状况，在１９９５年前解决食品供应问题。
    改革农业生产关系
    苏联建国７０多年来，粮食问题迄今未能从根本上解决。去年粮食产量仅有１．９４亿吨，倒退到１０年前的水平，市场上肉类、副食供应紧张，不得不从国外大量购买谷物、肉类、蔬菜、食糖、植物油等食品。戈尔巴乔夫最近提出，要是不能解决食品问题，“就有可能搞垮改革，就会使社会动荡不安”。从此可以看出解决农业问题的紧迫性。
    过去２０年里，苏联的农业投资约占国民经济总投资的２７％以上，数量不算小，但收效甚微。近几年来，通过对走过的道路的反思，苏联领导认识到农业落后的主要原因在于农村经济关系不合理，忽视了农民的利益，没有调动他们经营管理的积极性，导致“人与土地、与生产资料的脱离”。因此，提出解决农业问题的出路在于“根本改革农村经济关系”，扩大农民生产经营自主权，解放农业生产力。
    广泛实行租赁制
    苏共提出必须改变关于所有制的观念，承认生产资料社会主义所有制的各种形式具有平等权利，允许农民以各种经营形式进行密切协作。而广泛实行租赁制是改变农村经济关系的主要途径。戈尔巴乔夫在中央全会上强调指出：发展农村租赁关系是改革社会主义所有制关系的最重要的，也是现阶段具有决定性的途径之一。通过租赁，可以充分调动劳动者的积极性和创造性。
    长期以来，苏联都偏重从物质、技术上加强农业，没有考虑到完善生产关系的必要性，因而使农民“从土地的主人变成了打短工的人”。这次全会从经济关系中找问题、解决问题。会议认为，租赁承包形式就可以解决农民与土地和其他生产资料相脱离的现象，使劳动者和生产资料相结合，成为真正的主人，从而使土地和生产资料得到最有效的利用。租赁的期限可达５０年，这可以使农民安心地增加对土地的投入。
    目前，苏联已有一万多个农庄农场采用了租赁承包形式，约占全苏农庄农场总数的１／５。真正的承包集体收到了高效益，那里每公顷谷物产量要比一般农庄农场高１０００公斤至１５００公斤，每头牛挤奶量至少高５００公斤至６００公斤。
    苏联农业新政策还包括改革农业管理体制，进一步扩大经营自主权，自上而下地改组各级农工领导机构。机构改革总的出发点是实现管理民主化，生产者完全自主，形式不拘一格，因地制宜。此外，从多方面入手加速农村的社会改造，改善生产生活条件，以扭转人员大量外流的现象，使农民留在土地上。
    这次苏联制定改革农业的新政策是对农业的发展史进行了回顾后作出的结论。苏联理论家们认为，列宁对工农联盟十分重视，在十月革命后，苏维埃政权立即公布了土地法，使广大农民获得了赖以生存的土地。在推行新经济政策年代，实行以粮食税代替余粮收集制，限制了征收农户产品的数量，允许自由买卖土地，允许土地出租和使用一定数量的雇佣劳动，广泛发展合作运动。这一政策调动了农民的积极性，在１９２５年许多农业生产指标就已恢复到第一次世界大战前的水平。然而由于推行全盘集体化，在２０年代末至３０年代强行组织集体农庄，使生产关系超越了生产力发展的水平，违背了列宁的准则，农业遭到很大破坏。１９５４年苏共中央采取一系列加强农业的重大措施，特别是开垦荒地，使农业产量上升。至６０年代初约垦荒４２００万公顷，使全苏耕地面积扩大１／５，粮食产量也有所增长，但并没有根本解决粮食问题。
    苏共中央这次全会经过周密认真的准备，抓住了苏联农业落后的症结所在。这次改革可以说是自新经济政策以来历次农业改革中最深刻的一次。
    推行新政策还有阻力
    首先各级领导的看法并不完全一致。苏联人士认为，长期以来农业存在官僚体制，农场农庄的领导再不能坐享其成，今后只有有实绩的人才能得到好报酬。其次，目前落后的、甚至某些中等农庄的农民不大关心新体制，一部分农民愿意继续搞平均主义，吃“大锅饭”。某些领导干部的思想因循守旧也严重影响租赁承包形式在农业中的广泛推行。
    戈尔巴乔夫最近强调指出，“多年来全会第一次把根本改变所有制关系、农村的生产关系、向新的经营形式过渡及根本改变管理方法提到经济问题决定的重要位置”，这已“超出农业问题的范围，具有极重要的理论、政治和经济意义”。总之，苏联农业政策的重大转折已开始，农业改革的成败关系到苏联整个经济改革的成败。
