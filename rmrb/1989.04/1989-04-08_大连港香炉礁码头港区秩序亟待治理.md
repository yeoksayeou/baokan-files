    The trade at Dalian Port is becoming increasingly prosperous. Vehicles entering and exiting Dalian Port's Xiangluojiao Wharf are in a constant stream day and night. Some unlicensed vendors take advantage of the fact that this area is far from the city center and has a high volume of transient people. They gather at the three-way intersection between the 1st gate of the wharf and the customs gate, setting up stalls and hawking their wares along the public roads and railways. This obstructs traffic in the port area and affects the security environment. Although the Dalian Port Public Security Bureau and other relevant departments have repeatedly advised them, the effect has not been significant. Since the beginning of this year, materials within the port have often not been able to be timely dispersed, and materials outside the port have not been able to be timely loaded onto ships. The speedy dispatch of foreign vessels is often delayed.

    The order at Xiangluojiao Wharf urgently needs comprehensive management!

    大连港香炉礁码头港区秩序亟待治理
    大连口岸贸易日趋繁荣。进出大连港香炉礁码头的车辆日夜川流不息。一些无证商贩利用这里离市区较远，流动人员多的机会，集结在码头1号门外与海关门之间的公路、铁路交汇的三岔路口处摆摊设点叫卖，有碍港区交通和影响治安环境。大连港公安局等有关部门虽曾多次劝导，效果并不明显。今年开春以来，港内物资经常不能及时疏散出港，港外物资不能及时进港装船，外轮速遣工作往往被迫推迟。
    香炉礁码头港区的秩序亟待综合治理！
