	After a night of cold, the sky, which had been gloomy for several days, finally showed signs of clearing. I pushed open the door to the corridor, and the wind outside the railing was no longer so biting. The mountains stretched out in a winding manner towards the horizon. Thus, I stood still.

	I seemed to be waiting for something. Winter on Mount Lu is tranquil and lonely. In the morning, all one can hear is the sound of frost cracking on the branches. This is the sound of ice crystals carefully wrapping around the golden bell flowers, the winter jasmine, the Chinese juniper, and the gardenia. Suddenly, a string of amber-like ornaments shine brightly by the stream, on the path, and on the slopes, like the crystal-clear eyes of children.

	I wish I could experience the pain and joy of the lingering and affectionate frost as it solidifies in an instant, but I would rather have a mysterious force gently dispel the loneliness of Mount Lu in winter.

	It started to snow, a heavy snowfall. The flying snowflakes made the whole world seem to be breathing happily. The indistinct sky and earth are so close to people that you hardly have time to distinguish the various wonders of the green mountains losing their color and the frozen river shining brightly. So, open your heart and pour out your pent-up feelings and love. Standing amidst the high mountains and valleys, you are fortunate to see a world that is pure and beautiful.

	The snowflakes quietly accumulate into a snow blanket, covering the red and green villas in Donggu. The ice on Lake Ruoqin is dressed in a snowy white, vainly trying to distinguish itself from the lake and the sky. The pine trees shake off the excess snow to become sculptures of jade trees and silver flowers, while the small wooden bridge happily groans under the snow...

	After the snow, Mount Lu looks like a transparent glass case. The sunlight dances freely inside, and bright golden spots roll playfully down the snowy slopes. Children rush out from the courtyard, slide down the steps, and jump out from the windows, throwing snowballs, building snowmen, and rolling snowballs. In an instant, red, dark green, and orange clothing weave and crisscross, standing out vividly and lively against the silver and crystal-clear background.

	The pebbles wear snow caps, like clumsy mushrooms. The stream still sings among them. A cluster of wild berries stubbornly stretches out its arms from the snow pile. The frozen branches and twigs are more elegant than coral trees. The stone pine still hangs on the cliff, and the long icicles cascade down like a waterfall, slowing down slightly as they pass through its white, fluffy canopy, before plunging into the abyss...

	It turns out that winter on Mount Lu is not lonely: the wind still rushes, the clouds still float, the spring water still flows and tumbles, and the sunlight is exceptionally brilliant; and there is the pure and dignified white snow.

	I wonder why more and more domestic and foreign tourists choose to visit Mount Lu in winter? Perhaps it is because the winter of Mount Lu is the true winter of Jiangnan—it embodies the purity of life and showcases the profoundness of nature.

　　庐山印象
　　崔龙弟
    一夜清冷，阴沉了数日的天空终于有了亮色。推开过道的门，栏杆外的风已不再那么凉冽剔骨，群山逶迤着拥向远方。于是，我伫立。
    我似乎在期待着什么。冬天的庐山，娴静而寂寞。清晨只听见雾淞在枝丫间劈啪作响，那是冰颗粒正细心地包裹着金樱、腊梅、扁柏、栀子；但见一串串仪态万方的琥珀忽然在溪畔、路旁、斜坡上闪亮，宛如孩子们水晶般的明眸。
    我多么希望体验缠绵多情的雾淞在凝固一刹那的痛苦和欢悦，但我更愿意有一种神秘的力量轻轻拂去庐山冬日的寂寞。
    下雪了，纷纷扬扬的大雪。漫天飞舞的银絮让人觉得整个世界都在快乐地呼吸。混沌一色的天地与人是这样的贴近，以至你简直无暇分辨寒山失翠，冻浦生辉的种种奇观。那么，敞开心扉倾吐你的积郁与爱恋吧，置身于这高山和峡谷间，你有幸看到了一个一尘不染的美妙纯净的世界。
    雪花幽幽地积成雪褥，覆盖了东谷中红红绿绿的别墅群。如琴湖的浮冰披上了皑皑的雪装，徒劳地要把自己与湖光、天色区别开来。松林为雕塑玉树银花而抖落多余的雪块，小木桥却在雪下快活地呻吟……
    雪后的庐山像个透明的玻璃匣子，阳光在匣中任情撒欢，一片片耀眼的金斑顺着雪坡活泼地滚转。孩子们喧闹着从院子里冲出来，从台阶上滑下来，从窗口里蹦出来，打雪仗，堆雪人，滚雪球。一时间，猩红的、墨绿的、桔黄的衣装交织穿梭，在银色的晶莹的背景映衬下，显得分外鲜艳生动。
    卵石戴起雪帽，仿佛一只只笨拙的大蘑菇，溪水依然在它们中间淙淙歌唱。一簇野浆果从雪堆里顽强地探出手臂，冻僵了的枝枝条条比珊瑚树更具风致。石松还挂在悬崖上，颀长的冰棱如水帘一般泻下来，经过它的白绒绒的伞盖时，不经意地缓一缓，便又向深渊坠去……
    原来冬天的庐山并不寂寞：风犹在奔腾，云还是沉浮，泉水哗哗跌宕，阳光别样灿烂；还有洁白的雪和它那无比洁白的庄严。
    我在想，为什么越来越多的中外游客宁愿选择冬天遨游匡庐？也许庐山的冬天才是江南真正的冬天——它体现了生命的纯洁，也展示着大自然的深沉。
