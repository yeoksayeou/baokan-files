Zhao Ziyang Meets with Yugoslav Guests, Says Reform Will Eventually Find a Way
Without Political System Reform, Stability Cannot Be Achieved; Too Fast or Too Early Steps Will Cause Instability

BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) — General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, Zhao Ziyang, met with Ivan Brgich, a member of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, in the Zhongnanhai this afternoon.

Zhao Ziyang, while introducing China's reform situation to the guest, emphasized that economic system reform must be combined with political system reform. He said that a country's development and reform cannot proceed without a stable situation, and without political system reform, stability cannot be achieved. However, if the steps of political system reform are too fast or too early, it will bring about instability.

Zhao Ziyang said that China has always valued the experience of Yugoslavia's reform, whether successful or not, it is very important to us and other socialist countries. He believes that whether conducting economic system reform or political system reform, it must be carried out according to the specific situation and national conditions of each country, and a uniform model cannot be adopted.

When talking about the difficulties in reform, Zhao Ziyang said that socialist countries, including China, have encountered some difficulties in reform, which is not surprising. Because transforming from the old model to a new system is a very difficult, arduous, and complex matter. In order to insist on reform, we even have to bear certain risks. He emphasized that socialism has no way out without reform, so we must insist on reform and firmly carry it out, and eventually, a way will be found.

Brgich reported to Zhao Ziyang on the comprehensive reform carried out by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, introduced the new ideas of Yugoslavia on political system reform and the current situation in Yugoslavia. He conveyed the greetings and invitation from the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and Chairman Shuvar to General Secretary Zhao Ziyang to visit Yugoslavia again at an appropriate time. Zhao Ziyang happily accepted the invitation.

During their stay in China, Brgich and his delegation had a meeting with Bao Tong, deputy director of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System, and were treated to a banquet by Jiang Zemin, member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of China and secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, during their visit to Shanghai.

　　赵紫阳会见南斯拉夫客人时说
    改革总会走出一条路来
    不搞政治体制改革稳定不了  步子过急或超前也会不安定
    本报北京４月１日讯  记者周象光报道：中共中央总书记赵紫阳今天下午在中南海会见了南共联盟中央主席团委员伊万·布里吉奇。
    赵紫阳在向客人介绍中国的改革情况时强调指出，经济体制改革要同政治体制改革结合进行。他说，一个国家的发展和改革，没有稳定的局势是不行的，而要形成稳定的局势，没有政治体制改革也是达不到的。但是，如果政治体制改革的步骤过急或超前，就会带来不安定。
    赵紫阳说，中国一向重视南斯拉夫改革的经验，不管是成功的或不那么成功的经验，对我们和其他社会主义国家都是很重要的。他认为，不论进行经济体制改革或政治体制改革，都要根据各国的具体情况和国情来进行，不能采取一样的模式。
    赵紫阳在谈到改革中的困难时说，社会主义国家包括中国，在改革中都遇到了一些困难，这是不奇怪的。因为从过去那种模式转变为新的一种制度，是相当困难、相当艰巨、相当复杂的事情。为了坚持改革，我们甚至还要承担一定的风险。他强调指出，社会主义不改革是没有出路的，所以要坚持改革，坚定地把改革进行下去，终究会走出一条路子来的。
    布里吉奇向赵紫阳通报了南共联盟进行全面改革的情况，介绍了南斯拉夫关于政治体制改革的新设想和南斯拉夫当前的局势。他转达了南共联盟中央主席团和舒瓦尔主席对赵紫阳总书记的问候和邀请赵紫阳总书记在合适的时候再次访南。赵紫阳愉快地接受了邀请。
    布里吉奇一行在华期间曾同国家体改委副主任鲍彤进行座谈，在上海访问时，中共中央政治局委员、中共上海市委书记江泽民曾设宴款待。
