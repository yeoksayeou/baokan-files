The Path to the World – Recording the Jiangxi Marine Model Team's "Three-Peat" at the World Championships

On the northern bank of the Ganjiang River lies Shazi Ling, a barren landscape with no scenic views, no tourists, and no roads. However, the Jiangxi Marine Model Team has forged a path of success and a road to the world through thorns and tribulations.

“China's Unique Achievement”

Marine models have a 500-year history along the Rhine River, where the "Golden Anchor Heroes" compete. In 1985, the Jiangxi Marine Model Team arrived at the Rhine River and emerged victorious. Under the guidance of Coach Xiong Jisheng, team member Li Jie crafted a 1:350 scale model ship that won the gold medal. This 26.8-centimeter model faithfully replicates the proportions of a real ship. Every component on the model, such as the radar, life rings, lifeboats, oars, anchors, and chains, adheres to the 1:350 scale. The 300-plus threads on the mast, as thin as spider webs, pass through tiny pulleys the size of sesame seeds, appearing lifelike under a high-powered microscope. Even foreigners exclaimed, “China's unique achievement!”

Innovative Miniature Ship

The "Xiangyang Hong 10" carried the Chinese expedition team to conquer the South Pole, making this ship even more notable. Under the meticulous guidance of Coach Xiong, team member Xu Rong spent two years crafting a 19.5-centimeter miniature model of the "Xiangyang Hong 10" at a 1:800 scale. The exterior is exquisite and intricate, with over 200 windows on the less-than-10-centimeter bridge. The giant crane's hydraulic arm, as thin as a needle, can extend, retract, and rotate to lift objects. Remarkably, the waterline below the model is exposed, revealing the intricate machinery inside the hull that is barely visible to the naked eye. The miniature model of the "Xiangyang Hong 10" secured the championship, further boosting the team's confidence to scale new heights.

Marching Towards New Goals

Li Jie's "Japanese Maru" four-masted sailboat won the championship at the fifth World Marine Model Championship, achieving a three-peat for the Jiangxi Marine Model Team. The team members gazed at the pristine sails and handled the delicate ropes, marching towards new goals. They observed various sailboats on the Ganjiang River to study their wind-catching capabilities. Upon returning, they created 31 sail models of different shapes and sizes, treated them with adhesive and pressure, and mounted them on the masts. The model seemed to catch the wind and swiftly sailed on the river.

　　走向世界之路    
    ——记获世界锦标赛“三连冠”的江西海模队
    赣江北岸的沙子岭，满目斑斑剥剥，没有风景，没有游人，也没有路。但是，江西航海模型队历经荆棘坎坷，从那里走出一条成功之路，一条通往世界之路。
    　　　　“中国一绝”
    航海模型在莱茵河两畔，具有５００多年的悠久传统，这里是“金锚英雄”角逐之地。
    江西海模队１９８５年第一次来到莱茵河畔就旗开得胜。熊吉生教练指导队员李杰制作的１∶３５０船荣获金牌。这艘２６．８厘米的模型在整体上符合真船的比例，而且模型上每个零部件诸如雷达、救生圈、救生艇和艇上的一柄柄桨、铁锚和锚链也都符合１∶３５０的比例，桅杆上那３００多根细如蛛丝的绳索，根根穿过比芝麻粒还小的滑轮，在高倍放大镜下显得维妙维肖，使那些蓝眼睛看了都惊呼：“中国一绝！”
    新颖的袖珍船
    “向阳红——１０号”载着中国考察队征服了南极，因而这艘船也更为世人瞩目。队员徐荣在熊教练的精心指导下，整整用了两年功夫，按１∶８００的比例，将“向阳红——１０号”制成１９．５厘米的袖珍模型。外观珑玲剔透，巧夺天工，在不到１０厘米的船桥上敞开着２００多个窗户，那只有大头针粗细的大吊车的巨臂的液压杆能伸能缩、自转起吊；而且破天荒地把模型的水线以下敞开，露出船舱内用肉眼看不清的机器装备。“向阳红——１０号”袖珍模型夺魁，更使全队充满攀登高峰的信心。
    向新目标进军
    李杰的“日本丸”四桅帆船在第五届世界外观航海模型锦标赛中夺冠，江西海模队实现了三连冠。全队队员凝视着那洁白的帆，摆弄着那纤纤的帆，向新的目标进军。他们来到赣江边观看各式各样的帆受风的状态，回来做了３１个横的、三角的，大小不一形状各异的风帆压模，经过涂胶加压处理，挂上桅杆，嗬，那模型像是借了东风，疾驶在江上。
