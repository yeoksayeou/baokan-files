Two forestry pioneers in the Xinzhou region of Shanxi Province have vastly different lives in their later years: Zhang Houla of Xintan Village, Huashutai Township, Baode County, passed away in poverty and despair, while Gao Fu of Bajiao Village, Shenqi County, is well taken care of and lives comfortably.

Zhang Houla, known as the "Wild Man," was 87 years old when he passed away. He was a national labor model. He dedicated his life to afforestation and greening, often living in the deep mountains year-round. He planted 1 million trees, of which 300,000 were donated to the state, and received numerous awards. Gao Fu, 85 years old, is a provincial labor model. He led the "Old Qufu" afforestation team in Bajiao Village, working tirelessly for 20 years to plant 8,000 mu of trees and 700,000 scattered trees, with a total value of 4.1 million yuan.

These two renowned labor models have vastly different fates in their later years. Zhang Houla lived in a dark and dilapidated cave dwelling. After becoming paralyzed in 1987, the county rarely paid attention to him. The county forestry bureau only provided 15 yuan in monthly living allowance. The old man's unpaid living expenses of over 600 yuan and medical bills of 600 yuan went unaddressed despite his pleas. On April 11, he died in poverty and despair. In contrast, the people's government of Shenqi County, Bajiao Township, and the village committee where Gao Fu lives have taken meticulous care of him. The Bajiao Village Committee bought an old man a television, providing him with an annual living allowance of 400 yuan and 360 jin of fine grain. The Bajiao Township People's Government is responsible for all medical expenses, and the county has accumulated rewards and subsidies of over 3,000 yuan in recent years. On Gao Fu's 80th birthday, the county party committee and government erected a "Forestry Pioneer" memorial for him. Whenever he falls ill, the county sends a car to pick him up, and the county leaders personally arrange for his hospitalization. Now, Gao Fu is in good health, with clear eyesight and hearing. He greets visitors warmly, always wearing his favorite suit and eight medals when receiving guests.

　　两名造林功臣　晚年境遇不同    
    保德县张侯拉在穷困悲愤中去世    
    神池县高富受多方照顾丰衣足食
    新华社太原４月２３日电（通讯员胡有恒、杨俊峰）山西省忻州地区两名“造林功臣”晚年生活截然不同：保德县化树塔乡新畦村张侯拉骨瘦如柴在困境中去世，神池县八角村高富红光满面，丰衣足食。
    被称为“野人”的张侯拉今年去世时８７岁，是全国劳动模范。他为植树造林搞绿化，常年吃住在深山，植树１００万株，其中３０万株献给国家，多次受到表彰。高富今年８５岁，是省劳动模范，曾带领八角村“老愚公”造林专业队，苦战２０年，造林８０００多亩，零星植树７万余株，总价值达４１０万元。
    这两位名声赫赫的劳动模范，晚年境遇相去甚远。张侯拉住的是一孔又黑又破的窑洞，１９８７年瘫痪后，县里很少过问，县林业局每月只发给１５元生活补助费，老人欠下的６００余元生活费和６００元医药费四处求情无着落。今年４月１１日他在穷困悲愤中撒手人间。而神池县人民政府、八角镇政府和高富所在的村民委员会对高富的照顾无微不至，八角村民委员会给老人买了一台电视机，每年给生活补助４００元、细粮３６０斤，八角镇人民政府负责全部医疗保健开支，县里近年累计给的奖励、补助费３０００余元。高富８０寿辰时，县委、县政府还给他立了“造林功臣”纪念碑。每当他生病时都是县里派车接送，县里的领导亲自安排住院。现在高富老人耳不聋，眼不花，见人喜哈哈，凡有外人来访，他总要穿上自己喜欢的礼服，戴上８枚奖章热情接待。
