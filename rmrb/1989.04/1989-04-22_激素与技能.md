    Scientists generally believe that human gender and proficiency in certain skills are "interrelated." For example, women are usually better at learning languages and manual skills, while men excel in spatial thinking (such as reading maps) and logical reasoning. Recently, a series of studies conducted by Japanese-Canadian psychologist Kiyoshi Kimura further confirmed that the "fluctuations" in the amount of estrogen secreted by women each month also have a "direct impact" on certain skills. According to his survey of 150 adult women, during the period just before ovulation when estrogen levels are at their highest, language abilities are particularly strong: repeating a tongue twister five times in a row, which usually takes an average of 17 seconds, now takes only 11 seconds; memorizing 50 obscure words, which usually takes an average of 35 minutes, now takes only 21 minutes. However, during the menstrual period (when estrogen levels are at their lowest), women's spatial thinking abilities are noticeably stronger than at other times.

　　激素与技能
    科学家们普遍认为，人类的性别与擅长何种技能“息息相关”，如女性一般善学语言和手工技巧，而男性则善空间思维（如看地图）和逻辑推理。最近加拿大的日裔心理学家木村进行的一系列研究又证实，妇女每月雌性激素分泌量的“波动”也会对某些技能产生明显的“直接影响”。据他对１５０名成年妇女的调查，在被调查者每月排卵前雌性激素分泌量最高时，语言能力表现得特强：连续５遍说一句绕口令平时平均需１７秒钟，但此时平均只需１１秒钟；熟记５０个生僻单词平时平均需３５分钟，但此时仅需２１分钟。而当被调查者月经期（即雌性激素分泌量处于低潮）时，她们的空间思维能力又比其他时候明显增强。
