		Whether this year's price increase can be significantly lower than last year's is a topic of much debate. Economist Zhang Zhuoyuan, when discussing the realization of this goal, believes: there are difficulties, there are ways, and there is hope.

		Realizing that this year's price increase will be significantly lower than last year's is a major concern for leaders at all levels of government and a matter of great concern to millions of people. Recently, in a small office where bookshelves and desks occupy most of the space, the reporter met with Zhang Zhuoyuan, Director of the Institute of Financial and Trade Economics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, to discuss the contentious issue of prices.

		He candidly said, "This year's price situation is indeed quite severe. First, the rapid price increases in the second half of last year have made this year's price base high, which will become a 'carryover factor' causing the price level in the first half of this year to be significantly higher than the same period last year. Second, the structural distortions of 'long lines getting longer and short lines getting shorter' have led to price distortions, with the prices of basic products such as grain contract procurement, coal, and mineral products being too low, a situation that has become increasingly severe in the past one or two years, creating enormous pressure for price adjustments. Third, the impulse and behavior of units and individuals to maximize income are becoming more prevalent, and the expansion of various incomes will exacerbate the shortage of consumer goods. Additionally, efforts to reduce fixed asset investments and control the purchasing power of social groups have not been very effective, so the supply-demand gap cannot be ignored and may create strong pressure for price increases. However, there is one fundamental difference this year compared to last year: last year, an expansionary macroeconomic policy was implemented for a long time, while this year, under the policy of rectification and adjustment, a moderately tight economic policy is being implemented. It is this policy shift that provides the possibility for the price increase this year to be lower than last year."

		He said, "Recently, a series of rectification and adjustment measures have been introduced, which have eased people's anxiety about inflation. Bank savings and currency circulation have increased significantly, and the prices of some products that were driven up by panic buying have started to fall. According to market feedback from Guangdong and other places, the price of 'Wanbao' brand refrigerators has dropped from around 3,000 yuan during the peak buying period to 2,400 yuan."

		However, despite the fact that the rectification of inflation has shown some results, to achieve a significant reduction in the annual price increase, further efforts are needed. Zhang Zhuoyuan proposed that efforts should be focused on developing agricultural production, accelerating financial reforms, controlling consumption funds, and stopping illegal reselling:

		Develop agriculture and stabilize grain prices. This is the foundation for stabilizing prices. Currently, residents spend more than 50% of their total expenditure on food. If grain production increases and the contract procurement price of grain is appropriately raised and stabilized, then meat, vegetables, and other food prices will also be guaranteed, and the pressure to raise prices in the 'basket of goods' can be greatly alleviated, thereby stabilizing about half of the retail prices. Moreover, agriculture provides a large amount of raw materials for the consumer goods industry. If the prices of agricultural products can be stabilized, it will create conditions for controlling the prices of consumer goods. A good agricultural harvest and the stabilization of the prices of grain and other major agricultural products can have a significant impact on reducing the price increase.

		Accelerate financial reforms. First, the central bank should be empowered to independently implement monetary and credit policies, so that it can strictly issue currency according to economic development needs and strictly issue loans based on the benefits of construction and production projects, which is beneficial for eliminating the subjectivity and arbitrariness in the 'total valve' of currency issuance. Second, improve the interest rate reform and appropriately raise the deposit and loan interest rates, thereby encouraging savings and curbing unreasonable investments. Some enterprise managers in Shenzhen used to lose sleep over borrowing foreign exchange, and they would only dare to borrow if they had a clear guarantee of economic benefits significantly higher than the repayment amount. However, many enterprises in the inland regions borrow loans so casually, which is obviously not conducive to the most effective allocation of the most precious resource—capital.

		Strengthen the constraint mechanism on workers' income. This requires, in conjunction with the establishment of a necessary social security system, raising loan interest rates, strengthening market competition, and resolutely eliminating a batch of backward enterprises, creating a certain pressure of enterprise bankruptcy and worker unemployment. Only by doing so can we stop enterprises from using almost all the money they earn to give bonuses.

		Stop illegal reselling. The widespread existence of illegal reselling is actually adding fuel to the fire of price increases. In some places now, violating price discipline has become the norm, while adhering to price discipline has become news, which shows that the rule of law is very weak and very lax, and it is urgent to strengthen and correct it.

		The rectification of inflation requires efforts from multiple aspects and the understanding and support of the masses. Although there are difficulties in achieving the goal of controlling prices this year, as long as the rectification and adjustment policies are persistently and effectively implemented, there are ways and hope."

　　今年物价上涨幅度能否明显低于去年，众说纷纭。经济学家张卓元谈实现这一目标时认为：
    有困难　有办法　有希望
    本报记者  董焕亮
    实现今年物价的上涨幅度明显低于去年，是当前萦绕在各级政府领导脑际，牵挂着千万人心的大问题。最近，在一间书橱、书桌占据大半空间的狭小办公室里，记者见到了中国社会科学院财贸经济研究所所长张卓元，请他透视一下众说纷纭的物价问题。
    他坦率地说：“今年的物价形势确实比较严峻，一是去年下半年物价急遽上升，致使今年物价起点就高，将成为今年上半年物价水平显著高于去年同期的‘翘尾巴因素’。二是长线越来越长、短线越来越短的结构性扭曲的同时，价格结构扭曲，基础产品中如粮食合同收购价、煤价、矿产品价偏低状况，近一两年来愈益严重，将形成物价调整的巨大压力。三是单位和个人追求收入最大化的冲动和行为愈来愈盛，各种收入的膨胀将会加剧消费品的供不应求。此外，压缩固定资产投资、控制社会集团购买力等，效果尚不明显，因此供求缺口不能忽视，可能形成物价上涨的强大压力。但是，今年有一个情况根本不同于去年，即去年很长一段时间实行的是扩张的宏观经济政策，而今年则是在治理、整顿方针下实行适度紧缩的经济政策。正是这一政策的转变，为物价增长幅度低于去年提供了可能性。”
    他说，最近一系列治理、整顿措施的出台，使人们对通货膨胀的紧张心理有所缓和，银行储蓄和货币回笼明显增加，市场上因抢购抬高的部分产品的价格已出现回跌。据广东等地市场反映，“万宝”牌电冰箱已从抢购高峰期的每台３０００元左右，降到２４００元。
    然而，尽管目前治理通货膨胀已经见到了一点成效，但要实现全年物价涨幅的明显回落，还需进一步有所作为。张卓元提出，要着重在发展农业生产，加快金融改革，控制消费基金，制止非法倒卖等方面下功夫：
    抓好农业，稳定粮价。这是稳定物价的基础。目前，居民平均用于食品的支出仍占总支出的５０％以上。粮食增产了，粮食合同收购价适当提高后大体稳定了，肉、蔬菜等副食品也就有了保证，“菜篮子”里的涨价压力就可以较大地缓解，就能大体稳住零售物价的约半数。而且，农业为消费品工业提供大量原料。农产品价格如能大体稳住了，就为控制消费品价格创造了条件。农业收成好，大体稳住以粮食为主的农产品价格，可以对降低物价涨幅产生大面积的影响。
    加快金融改革。一是要赋予中央银行独立行使货币政策、信贷政策的权力，致使它能够严格按照经济发展需要发票子，严格根据建设项目和生产项目的效益发放贷款，有利于消除在货币发行这一“总闸门”开关上的主观随意性。二是搞好利率改革，适当提高存款、贷款利率，从而鼓励储蓄，抑制不合理的投资。蛇口的一些企业经理，借外汇以前往往睡不着觉，须有经济效益有明显高于还本付息额的把握才敢借。而内地许多企业贷款那样随便，显然不利于最宝贵的资源——资金的最有效配置。
    增强对职工收入的约束机制。这就要在建立必要的社会保障体系的配合下，通过提高贷款利率，加强市场竞争，下决心淘汰一批经营落后的企业，造成适度的企业破产和职工失业的压力。这样做，才能制止企业把赚到的钱几乎都用来发奖金。
    制止非法倒卖。倒买倒卖的大量存在，实际是为物价上涨火上浇油。现在有些地方，违犯物价纪律成了“常态”，遵守物价纪律倒成了“新闻”，这说明法制很不健全，很不严肃，亟需加强和纠正。
    治理通货膨胀要从多方面努力，还要取得群众的理解和支持。尽管实现今年控制物价目标有困难，但只要持之以恒地切实落实治理、整顿的方针，还是有办法，有希望的。”
