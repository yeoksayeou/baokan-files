    Population experts have proposed establishing a new mechanism to make having more children unprofitable.

    Our country's severe population development situation has drawn significant attention from the scientific community. Three years ago, the National Commission of Science and Technology issued a major soft science project titled "China's Population Control and Strategies," which, through thorough research, demonstrated that the country is currently experiencing its third baby boom. The next decade will be the most challenging period for family planning, but also a historical opportunity to change the population predicament.

    Chinese people, especially farmers, are willing to have more children. Experts participating in the project's research conducted an in-depth discussion on this issue. They analyzed that the key to why people are willing to have more children lies in the value they place on children and the principle of "investment" and "output" in family reproductive behavior. For a long time, the direct and indirect costs of raising children in China have been very low, so low that even the poorest farmers can afford to raise several children. Once children grow into laborers, they immediately become a family's human capital for wealth creation. In other words, the "investment" is small, while the "output" is large.

    Experts believe that this distorted value system, which does not consider the quality of the population or the overall interests of the nation, inevitably leads families to pursue the expected "output" benefits. Additionally, there is no pension system in rural areas, and farmers have no hope of relying on society for old-age care, so they must find their own solutions—raising children to support them in old age. Experts believe that the solution lies in establishing a mechanism where families that have fewer children can gain the maximum positive benefits, while those who have more children do not gain positive benefits but instead incur negative benefits.

### 人口专家提出建立新机制　让多生孩子者无利可图

　　人口专家提出建立新机制
　　让多生孩子者无利可图
    本报讯　记者谢联辉报道：我国严峻的人口发展形势，引起了科学界极大的重视。３年前国家科委下达的重大软科学课题《中国人口控制与对策》，以翔实的论证表明：现在全国正处于第三次人口出生高峰，今后１０多年是我国计划生育工作最困难的时期，也是改变人口困境的一次历史机遇。
    中国人特别是农民为何愿意多生孩子？参加课题研究的专家们作了深入探讨。他们分析，人们之所以愿意多生孩子，关键在于对孩子的价值观和家庭生育行为中“投入”与“产出”的利益选择原则。长期以来，我国农民家庭养育孩子的直接、间接费用都很低，低到连最穷的农户也能养育几个孩子，而孩子一旦成长为劳动力，却立即成为家庭致富的人力资本。也即“投入”小，“产出”大。
    专家认为，这种不考虑人口素质高低、不考虑整个国家民族利益的扭曲的价值观，必然导向家庭对企望“产出”效益的追求。加上农村没有养老保险，农民养老靠社会无望，只好自谋出路——养儿防老。专家们认为，解决问题的办法，在于建立一种机制，使少生孩子的家庭可获最大的正利益，而多生者则得不到正利益，反而带来负利益。
