Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 5th.

The round table conference in Poland, which lasted two months, concluded tonight with the signing of a joint communiqué and three agreements on political, economic, social reforms, and the pluralism of trade unions.

Today, at the final plenary session of the round table conference held at the Council of Ministers, Polish Interior Minister Kiszczak delivered a concluding speech. He said, "Here, who gained what, who lost what, this question is not substantial, because the only winner is our motherland." He pointed out that the round table conference has proven a truth: when the motherland needs it, the Polish people can rise above their differences. However, the standard for measuring the results of the round table conference is work, is the persistent implementation of the agreements that have been reached, and is the facts that will appear in the future.

Subsequently, the opposition representative led by Solidarity, former Solidarity chairman Lech Wałęsa, delivered a written speech. He said that they came to the round table conference with three demands: to legalize Solidarity, the Rural Solidarity, and the Independent Students' Union. Now, these demands have all been accepted, thus creating the necessary prerequisites for embarking on the path of democratic reform. He believes that the round table conference may become the beginning of the road to a democratic and free Poland.

During the conference, Kiszczak and Wałęsa signed a brief joint communiqué on behalf of the government and the opposition, respectively. The communiqué mentioned that the parties participating in the round table conference decided to establish a consultative committee tasked with evaluating the implementation of the round table conference resolutions.

In addition, the three thematic subgroups under the conference signed the following documents: "Agreement on Political Reforms," "Position on Social and Economic Policies and Systemic Reforms," and "Position on the Pluralism of Trade Unions."

This round table conference was proposed by the Polish authorities in August last year and opened on February 6th.

The round table conference was convened at a time when Poland was carrying out extensive political and economic reforms and seeking to overcome the persistent economic and social crises. Many representatives pointed out in their speeches that this conference is a "historic event of great significance" for Poland.

　　波“圆桌会议”取得积极成果
    双方签署一项《公报》和三个协议
    新华社华沙四月五日电  （记者马云亮）历时两个月的波兰“圆桌会议”，在今晚签署了一项《公报》和三个关于政治、经济、社会改革和工会多元化问题的协议之后隆重闭幕。
    今天在部长会议宫举行的“圆桌会议”最后一次全体会议上，波兰政府内务部长基什查克发表了总结性讲话。他说，“在这里，谁赢得了多少，谁失去了多少，这个问题不是实质性的，因为胜利者只有一个--我们的祖国”。他指出，“圆桌会议”证明一个真理：当祖国需要的时候，波兰人民能够高踞于分歧之上。然而，衡量“圆桌会议”所取得结果的标准是工作，是坚持不懈地实施业经达成的协议，是未来将出现的事实。
    随后，以团结工会为主的反对派代表、前团结工会主席瓦文萨发表了书面讲话。他说，他们是带着三项要求前来参加“圆桌会议”的，这就是让团结工会、团结农会和独立大学生联合会合法化。如今，这些要求都已被接受，从而为走上民主改革之路创造了必不可少的前提条件。他认为，“圆桌会议”可能将成为通向民主和自由的波兰之路的开端。
    会议期间，基什查克和瓦文萨分别代表政府和反对派签署了一项简短的《公报》，其中提到，参加“圆桌会议”的各方决定建立一个协商委员会，任务是评价“圆桌会议”决议的实施情况。
    此外，会议下设的三个专题小组还分别签署了以下几个文件：《关于政治改革问题的协议》、《关于社会和经济政策以及体制改革问题的立场》和《关于工会多元化问题的立场》。
    这次“圆桌会议”是由波兰当局去年八月提议，于今年二月六日开幕的。
    “圆桌会议”是在波兰进行广泛政治、经济改革、谋求摆脱持续的经济和社会危机的时刻召开的。许多代表在会议发言中指出，这次会议对波兰是一次“具有历史意义的重大事件”。
