Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 21st.

In the midst of a broad youth movement, the theme of today's discussion meeting to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, held in Beijing, was to vigorously promote the glorious traditions of the May Fourth Movement and to invigorate the national spirit. This discussion meeting was jointly organized by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Students' Federation, and the Chinese Youth Thought Education Research Center.

Before the discussion meeting began, all participants stood in solemn silence to mourn the passing of the great Marxist-Leninist, mentor and friend of Chinese youth, and former Secretary-General of the Communist Youth League of China, Hu Yaobang.

Liu Yandong, a member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, said at the meeting that during his illustrious revolutionary career, Hu Yaobang had long served as the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. He initiated the most active period of the Party's youth work after the founding of the nation, enriched the theory and practice of the youth movement in the socialist period, and made indelible historical contributions to the development of the Chinese youth movement and the healthy growth of the Chinese youth generation.

She said that the May Fourth Movement not only left a precious spiritual heritage for the Chinese youth movement but also made us clear about the historical responsibility of contemporary youth. This is, contemporary youth should have a strong sense of crisis, be loyal and steadfast patriots; have a strong sense of construction, be steadfast reformers; have a strong sense of creation, be hardworking entrepreneurs; have a strong sense of progress, be pursuers of modern civilization.

Huang Zhijian, a deputy professor at the Chinese Youth Political College, said that Hu Yaobang had devoted his heart and soul to the growth of one generation after another. He laid the foundation for a new situation in youth work in the socialist period. He cared for, trusted, understood, and was close to the hearts of the youth, and he will always be worthy of our learning.

Yang Guangmin and Cao Fang, youth league cadres from Kunming, Yunnan Province, and Jiangxi Province, respectively, deeply recalled Hu Yaobang's multiple inspections of these two provinces, and their emotions were very stirred. They said that Hu Yaobang's style of deepening practice and being close to the masses is worth learning from by youth league cadres.

Liu Dajun, director of the Marxism-Leninism Research Office of the Fourth Military Medical University in Xi'an, summarized Hu Yaobang's excellent style in eight words. He said, "Hu Yaobang has always been 'sincere, sincere, truthful, and genuine' to the youth." Today, we should seriously learn from Hu Yaobang's lofty virtues and carry on his unfinished work, which is the best way to commemorate the May Fourth Movement.

Wu Xiaoshui, a cadre of the Hunan Provincial Youth League Committee, Jiang Yugu, secretary of the Party Committee of the Beijing Youth Political College, and Chen Taisheng, a cadre of the Youth Movement History Research Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, all spoke highly of Hu Yaobang as a respected and beloved mentor of Chinese youth. They expressed their determination to uphold the banner of democracy and science advocated by the May Fourth Movement and to make due contributions to the modernization construction of our country.
