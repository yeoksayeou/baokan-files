China's "International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction" Committee Established
Vice Premier Tian Jiyun Appointed as Chairman

BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- With the approval of the State Council, the China "International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction" Committee was established here today. Vice Premier Tian Jiyun was appointed as the chairman of the committee.

According to a resolution adopted by the 42nd session of the United Nations General Assembly, the "International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction" activities in China will start in 1990 and end in 2000. The main objective is to respond to the United Nations' initiative, actively carry out disaster reduction activities, enhance the awareness of disaster prevention among the entire population and society, improve the level of disaster prevention, resistance, and relief work in China, and reduce the losses caused by natural disasters.

Cui Naifu, Minister of Civil Affairs and Vice Chairman of the China "International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction" Committee, introduced China's natural disaster situation and the work to be done after the establishment of the committee at the inaugural meeting.

Tian Jiyun pointed out at the meeting that disaster reduction work should be regarded as a major task for promoting the development of social and economic production, included in the important agenda of governments at all levels, and incorporated into the national economic development plan. All economic activities should consider the factors of disaster reduction. Whether in the design or construction of cities, reservoirs, houses, bridges, and roads, the issue of disaster resistance and prevention should be considered; for common disasters that occur every year, effective countermeasures for disaster reduction should be sought; for areas prone to disasters, comprehensive long-term plans should be formulated.

　　中国“国际减灾十年”委员会成立    
    田纪云副总理任主任
    本报北京４月２１日讯  记者李德金报道：经国务院批准，中国“国际减灾十年”委员会今天在这里成立。国务院副总理田纪云任委员会主任。
    根据第四十二届联大通过的一项决议案，中国“国际减灾十年”活动从１９９０年开始，到２０００年结束。它的宗旨是：响应联合国倡议，积极开展减灾活动，增强全民、全社会的防灾意识，提高我国防灾、抗灾、救灾工作的水平，减轻自然灾害带来的损失。
    民政部部长、中国“国际减灾十年”委员会副主任崔乃夫在成立大会上介绍了中国的自然灾害情况，以及委员会成立后要做的工作。
    田纪云在会上指出，应把减灾工作作为推进社会经济生产发展的一件大事，列入各级政府的重要议事日程，纳入国民经济发展规划。各项经济活动都要考虑减灾因素。不论是设计或建造城市、水库、房屋、桥梁和道路，都要考虑抗灾设防的问题；对年年发生的常见灾害，要寻找减灾的有效对策；对灾害多发区，要制定综合治理的长远规划。
