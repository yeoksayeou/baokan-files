High-Interest Bonds Should Not Be Promoted

Guan Yunze, National Energy Investment Corporation

Currently, high-interest bonds are showing a trend of further development, and several concerning issues have emerged:

First, high-interest bonds are not conducive to controlling inflation. Interest is a portion of surplus value transferred from industrial capital to monetary capital. Generally, loan interest rates should be lower than the average profit rate of social capital. In China, the profit rate of state-owned industrial enterprises was only 23.1% in 1988, so our interest rates should not be too high. Currently, the annual interest rate for high-interest bonds is over 25%, with some reaching as high as 100%. Such a large increase in interest rates will inevitably affect the income of the state and enterprises, with some enterprises hoping to raise product prices. However, interest rates should not be lower than the inflation rate; otherwise, savings will not be profitable, affecting credit relationships. In an inflationary environment, when the inflation rate approaches or exceeds the average profit rate of social capital, bank deposit and loan interest rates should not be lower than the average profit rate of social capital to combat excessive currency circulation and reduce total social demand. Once the situation of excessive currency circulation is corrected and the inflation rate returns to normal, interest rates should be promptly restored to below the average profit rate of social capital. However, the annual interest rate for high-interest bonds is fixed and does not change, and the issuance period is generally quite long, sometimes lasting three to five years. This goes against the intention of using high-interest rates to quickly reverse the inflationary situation.

Second, high-interest bonds are not conducive to adjusting the industrial structure. Bonds do not increase the total amount of social capital but only adjust the flow of some capital. High-interest bonds must be repaid upon maturity, and the interest is high, making them suitable for industries with quick returns and high profits, such as general processing industries. This will inevitably cause the already rapidly developing processing industries to further expand. Can the state use high-interest bonds to direct funds towards energy, key raw materials, transportation, postal and telecommunications, and agriculture, which are "bottleneck" industries? Most of these industries face issues of low prices and poor profitability, making it difficult to repay even preferential interest rates from state budget-invested funds. Using high-interest bonds, which must be repaid upon maturity, would be even less appropriate.

In light of the above reasons, I believe that adjusting the flow of funds should not be done through high-interest bonds.

### 高息债券不宜提倡

　　高息债券不宜提倡
    国家能源投资公司  关云泽
    目前，社会上高息债券有进一步发展的趋势，出现了一些值得忧虑的问题：
    一是高息债券不利于抑制通货膨胀。利息是产业资本让渡给货币资本的一部分剩余价值，贷款利率一般应低于社会平均资金利润率。我国的资金利税率水平不高，全民所有制工业企业１９８８年才２３．１％，因此我国的利率也不宜过高。目前，高息债券的年利率在２５％以上，有的高达１００％。利息上升幅度过大，必然要影响国家和企业的收入，有的企业则寄希望于提高产品价格。但是，利率也不能低于物价上涨率，否则存款无利可图，就会影响信贷关系。在通货膨胀情况下，当物价上涨率接近甚至高于社会平均资金利税率时，银行存、贷款利率就不能低于社会平均资金利税率，以便起到对付货币过量、压缩社会总需求的作用。随着货币相对过量状况得到扭转，物价上涨率恢复正常以后，利率也要及时恢复到社会平均资金利税率以下。但是高息债券的年利率却固定不变，而且发行期一般比较长，有的需要三五年，这就违背了用高息办法尽快扭转通货膨胀局面的初衷。
    二是高息债券不利于调整产业结构。债券并不增加社会资金总量，只是调整了部分资金的流向。高息债券到期必须归还，并且利息很高，比较适用于发展见效快、盈利多的一般加工工业。这样，必然使目前发展已经过速的加工工业更加膨胀。国家能不能通过发行高息债券，把资金引向能源、重点原材料、交通运输、邮电通讯、农业等“瓶颈”产业呢？由于这些产业多数存在价格偏低、盈利水平差的情况，连按期归还优惠利率的国家预算内投资都有困难，使用到期必须归还的高息债券就更不适宜了。
    鉴于以上理由，我认为调节资金流向不宜采用高息债券办法。
