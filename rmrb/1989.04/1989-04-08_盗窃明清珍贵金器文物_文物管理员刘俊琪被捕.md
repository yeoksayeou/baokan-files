The thief Liu Junqi, who stole six precious gold artifacts from the Ming and Qing dynasties, was arrested yesterday in Beijing.

According to a report from our Beijing bureau on April 7, Liu Junqi, an administrator of bronze artifacts at the Capital Museum, took advantage of a moment when he was called to answer a phone call to steal six artifacts from a table in the gold artifact storage room on one morning in April 1987. In September 1988, Liu cut two rings off an eleven-ring gold bracelet and had one ring sold for 2,500 yuan. The other ring was made into three rings and a necklace. After giving one ring to his wife, he sold the remaining rings and necklace for 2,000 yuan.

In December 1988, upon hearing that relevant authorities were investigating the case, Liu destroyed the evidence by smashing and cutting the six stolen artifacts and throwing them into the moat of Tucheng.

After receiving a report from the Capital Museum on December 26 of last year about the loss of precious artifacts, the Beijing Public Security Bureau immediately formed a task force to solve the case. After 70 days of effort, they obtained a large amount of evidence.

　　盗窃明清珍贵金器文物  文物管理员刘俊琪被捕
    本报北京４月７日讯  盗窃６件明清时期珍贵金器文物的罪犯刘俊琪昨天在此间被捕。
    １９８７年４月的一天上午，首都博物馆铜器文物管理员刘俊琪利用去金器库叫人接电话之机，将放在条桌上的６件文物拿走窃为己有。１９８８年９月，刘犯从十一环金蟠镯上剪下两圈金镯，托人将其中一圈金镯卖出获赃款２５００元，另一圈则加工成三枚戒指和一条项链，除留给妻子一枚戒指外，其余戒指、项链均卖出获２０００元。
    １９８８年１２月，刘犯闻知有关部门正在追查此案的消息后，为销毁罪证，便将６件窃取的珍贵文物分别砸坏剪碎，一起扔在土城护城河内。
    去年１２月２６日，北京市公安局接到首都博物馆丢失珍贵文物的报案后，立即组成侦破组全力破案。经过７０天的努力，取获了大量罪证。
