Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, April 3rd.

West German Chancellor Kohl made a statement tonight in Bonn on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of NATO, emphasizing West Germany's "key role" in the Western alliance, and stating that U.S. troops should continue to remain in Western Europe.

April 4th marks the 40th anniversary of NATO's founding.

Kohl said that due to West Germany's important geographical and strategic position, as well as the strength of the West German Federal Armed Forces, West Germany plays a "key role" in the Western alliance.

He pointed out that just as NATO needs West Germany, West Germany also needs NATO. He said that only by firmly linking with NATO can West Germany play an "influential" role in East-West relations, as well as in arms reduction and arms control.

Kohl said that the continued presence of U.S. conventional and nuclear forces in Western Europe is a necessity for NATO's defense.

He believes that the task for Europeans is to "strengthen the European pillar."

West German Foreign Minister Genscher and the Free Democratic Party and Social Democratic Party also made statements today, praising the role of NATO. Genscher called in his statement for NATO and the European Community to develop a common political strategy and promote East-West cooperation.

　　科尔就北约４０周年发表声明
    认为美军仍应留驻西欧
    新华社波恩４月３日电  西德总理科尔今晚在波恩就北约成立４０周年发表声明，强调西德在西方联盟中所起的“关键作用”，同时认为美国部队应继续留在西欧。
    今年４月４日是北约成立４０周年纪念日。
    科尔说，由于西德所处的地理及战略位置重要，再加上西德联邦国防军力量强大，因而西德在西方联盟中起着“关键作用”。
    他指出，正如北约需要西德一样，西德也需要北约。他说，只有同北约牢固地联系在一起，西德才能够在东西方关系以及裁军和军备控制方面发挥“影响”作用。
    科尔说，美国的常规部队和核部队继续留在西欧，是北约防御的需要。
    他认为，欧洲人的任务是要“加强欧洲支柱”。
    西德外长根舍、自民党和社民党今天也都发表声明，赞扬北约所起的作用。根舍在声明中呼吁北约和欧共体发展共同的政治战略，促进东西方合作。
