Over ten million Communist Party members from Fushun's party and government agencies and various fronts participated in the "Communist Party Member Volunteer Day" activities today, foregoing their rest.

Today, in every street and corner of Fushun, there were Party members at work, with red party flags flying everywhere. Party members were engaged in convenience services and poverty alleviation activities in urban streets and impoverished villages.

In the Xinfu District's Wugong Street, more than 500 Party member cadres from the Fushun Municipal Party Committee cleaned the residential areas and both sides of the roads thoroughly. Municipal Party Secretary Liu Zhenhua and others arrived early in the morning to work alongside everyone.

In the Wanghua District, a convenience service street stretching three to four kilometers was formed by Party members from over a hundred units. Here, services such as repairing household appliances, tailoring clothes, and legal consultations were provided one after another.

The "Coal Capital Road" in the Luting District is dusty on sunny days and muddy on rainy days. More than 2,000 Party members from the Fushun Mining Bureau system cleaned up 700 cubic meters of debris and garbage here in just one morning. Many Party miner workers, who had just finished their night shifts and hadn't even changed out of their work clothes, joined the volunteer labor force. Passersby, seeing the transformed "Coal Capital Road," all smiled with joy.

Party members from the Fushun County Committee donated 860 yuan, 2,792 jin of grain tickets, and 1,362 pieces of clothing to several impoverished households in Jiu Bing Township. They also helped more than ten households lacking labor force to plow and sow seeds with seeds and fertilizers donated by Party members.

Fushun's Party Member Volunteer Day activities were initiated by the Fushun Mining Bureau system and have been ongoing for over a year. Some grassroots units have already established this as a regular practice.

　　抚顺十多万共产党员参加奉献日义务劳动
    新华社沈阳４月１６日电　抚顺市党政机关和各条战线的１０多万共产党员今天放弃休息，参加“共产党员奉献日”活动。
    今天，在抚顺市每条街道、每个角落都有共产党员的身影，鲜红的党旗在各处飘扬。党员们分别在城市街道、贫困山村，开展便民服务、扶贫问暖活动。
    在新抚区武工街，中共抚顺市委机关的５００多名党员干部将居民住宅区和马路两旁的残土清理得干干净净。市委书记刘振华等一大早就赶到这里和大家一起劳动。
    在望花区，由上百家单位共产党员组成的便民服务一条街绵延三四公里。这里修理家用电器、剪裁衣服、法律咨询等各种服务点一个连着一个。
    露天区“煤都路”晴天一路尘，雨天一脚泥。抚顺矿务局系统的２０００多名党员在这里一上午就清除残土、垃圾７００多立方米。许多党员矿工下夜班后，工作服还没来得及换，就加入了义务劳动的行列。过路行人看到面貌一新的“煤都路”，都高兴地笑了。
    抚顺县委机关的共产党员，把他们捐献的８６０多元钱、２７９２斤粮票和１３６２件衣物送到救兵乡几个困难户手中。他们还和当地党员一起，用党员资助捐献的种籽、化肥，帮助１０多家缺少劳动力的农户耕田播种。
    抚顺市的党员奉献日活动，是由抚顺矿务局系统首先发起的，迄今已有一年多时间，一些基层单位已形成制度。
