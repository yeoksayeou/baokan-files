The Path of Solitude and the Heart of a Child
—An Interview with Sun Li
By Liu Menglan, Reporter for This Paper

The veteran writer Sun Li, after the turmoil, has seen his creativity reach new heights.

Sun Li, in his later years, rarely leaves home, quietly writing, and has already presented readers with several collections of essays and critiques.

Sun Li values the art of writing, especially the path of writing; he values the character of an article, especially the character of the author. He is sincere and upright, his writing is simple and genuine, criticizing social ills, expressing love and hate, and fearlessly "breaking taboos."

Some people call him an "eccentric old man," perhaps they do not truly understand him or his writing.

Reporter: You once said that to become a true artist, one must maintain a pure heart, a "child's heart." What exactly is a "child's heart"?

Sun Li: A "child's heart" is a heart content with solitude. Writing is the path of solitude. To engage in writing, one must be willing to endure solitude, not be tempted or disturbed by external fame and fortune. Only when the heart is calm can one, like a child, see the world in a peaceful and realistic way, reflecting reality. If one is always thinking about becoming an official or getting rich, the heart cannot be pure. How can one truly feel and reflect reality?

Reporter: In Chinese history, there have been many who have achieved greatness by writing in a state of solitude, right?

Sun Li: This situation is common in Chinese history and can be seen as a rule. In "Report to Ren An," Sima Qian points out that Confucius, Qu Yuan, Zuo Qiuming, and Sunzi all had "grievances in their hearts, unable to express their ideas," and thus "narrated past events and considered future ones," engaging in writing. The meaning is: writing is the path of solitude. Bai Juyi, Su Dongpo, Lu You, Liu Zongyuan, and others also engaged in writing because they were not successful. The "Dream of the Red Chamber" describes many scenes of prosperity and bustle, but was Cao Xueqin's heart not solitary?

Reporter: "Since ancient times, all sages have been solitary, only the drinkers leave their names," it seems that the great poet Li Bai was right.

Sun Li: The great scholar and thinker of the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, Wang Fuzhi, had numerous works, vast as smoke and clouds, wasn't it because he often hid in the deep mountains of Hunan, calmed his heart, and devoted himself to writing? For example, he read Sima Guang's "Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government," and wrote such a thick book "Comments on the Comprehensive Mirror," and the words are very beautiful, very emotional. I mention this example not to advocate that people hide in the mountains and avoid reality, but to illustrate that to engage in writing, one must have a calm heart, even in the midst of worldly noise.

Reporter: It seems that "content with solitude" not only allows writers to truly feel and reflect reality but also allows them to create beautiful language and art.

Sun Li: Yes. Only by calming the heart can one, as said in "Dream of the Red Chamber," have a heart like a clear mirror, hear the sounds of heaven and earth, and create beautiful language, achieving beautiful effects. If a writer is busy with fame and fortune, busy attending various gatherings and awards, busy going in and out of grand hotels, can they maintain a good creative state of mind? Can they have so much time to ponder and create beautiful language? Not only writers, but also painters, musicians, and other artists are the same. Of course, this is just from my personal thoughts and experiences, and cannot be generalized to others.

Reporter: There are also such people among modern writers, right?

Sun Li: Mr. Lu Xun is one. In his poem "Gift to Wu Qishan," he said: "Twenty years in Shanghai, every day seeing China, sick and not seeking medicine, bored and only reading books." Although this is a tone of satire, in my opinion, it also expresses Mr. Lu Xun's inner feelings of solitude at that time. It was in solitude that he read and wrote.

Reporter: If Mr. Lu Xun had also mingled in officialdom and pursued fame and fortune, perhaps China would not have had the great writer Lu Xun. Contemporary scholar Qian Zhongshu is also the most content with solitude. He did not want to be famous, but his "On the Art of Poetry" and "Guanzhui Edition" have become classics.

Sun Li: Therefore, I sometimes joke: "Writers are writers, don't become officials, and end up with both sides suffering." I used to be a small leader, but I couldn't do it, so I eventually didn't do anything. When I could go out, I tried to contact society as much as possible; when I was old, I sat at home reading and writing. I feel that this is very peaceful. Being a writer requires endurance of poverty and solitude, and cannot be about wealth and glory. Of course, people have different aspirations, some writers want to and can become officials, and I can also understand and forgive them.

Reporter: But in today's commercial economy, various fame and fortune, especially "money," have a great temptation, and it is not easy to be content with poverty and solitude.

Sun Li: Since ancient times, writing for "rice and clothing" is also normal, but one cannot write purely for "profit." Writers are indeed individual special spiritual labor, a bit like a small workshop producing goods, but cannot be like doing business, buying and selling empty goods. Social customs cannot but influence writers, especially some young people. A few people, for the sake of money, write some low-level vulgar, even decadent works, temporarily get applause and cheers, gain fame and fortune, but no matter what these literatures are called, what school they belong to, in the long run, they are worthless and have no future. Reform is progress. It is not that once reformed, decadent and decadent things must come out. The works of the European Renaissance period are also healthy and uplifting, inspiring people. No matter how the commodity economy develops, our literature should be to promote human progress.

### “寂寞之道”与“赤子之心”——访孙犁

　　“寂寞之道”与“赤子之心”
    ——访孙犁
    本报记者  刘梦岚
    老作家孙犁，浩劫过后，创作再现高峰。
    孙犁晚年足不出户，默默笔耕，已向读者奉献出散文、论文集十几种。
    孙犁重为文之法，尤重为文之道；重文章品格，尤重作者人格。其人诚挚、耿介，其文质朴、情真，针砭时弊，直言爱憎，不惮于“犯忌”。
    有人称之为“古怪的老头儿”，恐未能真正理解其人其文。
    记者：您曾说过，要想成为一个真正的艺术家，必须保持一种单纯的心，即“赤子之心”。究竟什么是“赤子之心”？
    孙犁：“赤子之心”，即安于寂寞之心。文章是寂寞之道，要从事写作，就要甘于寂寞，不受外界名利的诱惑和干扰。人心安静下来，才能像小孩子看这个世界，平静而真实地反映现实。倘若总想着做官、发财，心就不能纯净，怎么可能真实地感受和反映现实？
    记者：在中国历史上，安于寂寞状态从事写作而有所成就的，恐怕不乏其人吧。
    孙犁：这种情况在中国历史上很多，也可说是一条规律。司马迁在《报任安书》中指出，仲尼、屈原、左丘、孙子等人皆因“意有所郁结，不得通其道”，才“述往事，思来者”，从事写作的。其意思就是：文章是寂寞之道。白居易、苏东坡、陆游、柳宗元等，也都是因不得意而从事写作的。曹雪芹的《红楼梦》描写了诸多繁华热闹，但他的心境不寂寞？
    记者：“古来圣贤皆寂寞，唯有饮者留其名”，看来，大诗人李白说得不错。
    孙犁：明末清初的大学者、大思想家王船山，著作等身，浩如烟海，还不是因为他常年藏在湖南的深山里，静下心来，埋头从事著述吗？比如，他读司马光的《通鉴》，写了那么厚的一本《读通鉴论》，而且文字非常漂亮，非常有感情。我举这个例子，决不是提倡人们躲进深山，逃避现实，而是为了说明，要从事写作，必须心静，哪怕是在尘世喧嚣之中。
    记者：可见，“安于寂寞”不仅可以使作家真实地感受和反映现实，而且可以使作家创造出美的语言、美的艺术。
    孙犁：是的。只有安下心来，才能像《红楼梦》里说的那样，心像明镜一样，听到天籁地籁的声音，才能创造出美的语言，达到美的效果。一个作家，如果忙于利禄、声色，忙于参加各种聚会、评奖，忙于出入各大饭店，还能保持良好的创作心境？还能有那么多时间去推敲和创造美好的语言？不仅作家如此，画家、音乐家及其他艺术家也是如此。当然，这只是从我个人的思想和体验来说的，不能概括别人。
    记者：现代作家中也有这样的人吧？
    孙犁：鲁迅先生就是。他在《赠邬其山》一诗中说：“廿年居上海，每日见中华，有病不求药，无聊才读书。”这虽是一种讽刺的笔调，但依我看也道出了鲁迅先生当时内心的寂寞之情。他是在寂寞之中才读书、写作的。
    记者：如果鲁迅先生也去混迹官场、追名逐利，恐怕中国就没有伟大的文学家鲁迅了。当代大学者钱钟书也是最甘寂寞的。他不想出名，但他的《谈艺录》、《管锥编》却成了传世之作。
    孙犁：所以我有时开玩笑说：“作家就是作家，不要去做官，弄得两耽误。”我过去也当过小头头，可我干不了，后来干脆什么都不当了，能出去下去时，尽量多接触社会；老了就坐在家里读书、写文章。我觉得这样很心静。当作家就要耐得往清贫、寂寞，就不能荣华富贵。当然，人各有志，有的作家愿意并能够当官，我也能理解、原谅。
    记者：可是，在当今商品经济社会里，各种名利、特别是“金钱”，诱惑力确实不小，要做到安于清贫、安于寂寞，也不那么容易。
    孙犁：自古以来，文章为“稻粱谋”也是正常的，但不能单纯为了“谋利”而写文章。作家固然是个体的特殊精神劳动，有点像小作坊那样出产品，但不能像做买卖似的，买空卖空。社会风气不能不影响作家，特别是一些青年。少数人为了赚钱，写了一些低级庸俗、甚至没落颓废的作品，一时得到鼓掌喝彩，名利兼收，但不管这些文学叫什么名目、什么流派，从长远看，总是没有价值、没有前途的。改革是进步。不是一改革就得出没落、颓废的东西。欧洲文艺复兴时期的作品也是健康向上、鼓舞人心的。无论商品经济如何发展，我们的文学都应该是促使人类进步的。（上）
