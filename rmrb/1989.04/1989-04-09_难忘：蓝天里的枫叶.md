The maple leaf is a symbol of Canada. Therefore, Air Canada also uses the maple leaf as its logo.

The first time I dealt with Air Canada, I was working in Toronto and was preparing to go to Harvard University for a short-term training program. I heard that booking tickets in advance could save a lot of money, so I contacted Air Canada's ticket office two months ahead of time. The service representative was a courteous gentleman. He patiently answered all my questions: How many flights are there daily to Boston? What are the departure and arrival times for each flight? What is the price for a one-way ticket? What is the price for a round-trip ticket? When I decided to book a ticket, he told me to prepare 234 Canadian dollars and reminded me to pick up the ticket before the specified date.

A few days later, I went to Air Canada's ticket office and explained my purpose to a female service representative, handing her the money. She went to the computer and typed for a while, then apologetically said to me, "I'm sorry, your ticket should be 260 Canadian dollars."

Perhaps I looked surprised, because she immediately typed some more and, with a frown, said, "I'm very sorry, the lowest price for your ticket is 260 Canadian dollars."

I made a helpless expression and took out an additional 26 Canadian dollars to give to her. She filled out my ticket while saying, "I'll take this 26 dollars from you first, and you can explain the situation to our company's public relations department." Then she neatly wrote down the address and phone number on a slip of paper and handed it to me.

I had no interest in writing a letter to get money back, but a Canadian friend of mine encouraged me to try my luck and helped me write a short letter, which I sent out.

When I finished my training and returned from Boston, I saw a pile of mail on my table, including one envelope with a prominent Air Canada maple leaf logo. Opening it, I found a short letter from Air Canada's public relations department and a check for 26 Canadian dollars. The letter read: "Ms. Chen, we are very sorry. Due to our mistake in quoting a price that was 26 dollars lower, we have caused you trouble. This is our fault, and for that, we return the 26 dollars to you. Please forgive us and welcome you to fly with Air Canada again."

Seeing this letter and the check, I indeed thought a lot. I don't know Air Canada's reputation in the international aviation industry, but as a passenger, whenever possible, I will choose to fly with Air Canada.

The service quality of an airline is not only reflected in daily service but also in how it handles unexpected events. Coincidentally, on my last flight back to China with Air Canada, I encountered trouble. The flight from Toronto to Los Angeles was fully booked, and I and more than 10 other passengers were "abandoned." This phenomenon is not uncommon abroad because airlines, to reduce empty seats, often sell a few extra tickets in case some passengers cancel at the last minute.

Just as we were at a loss, an Air Canada representative came over. She apologized to everyone and said, "Our company will refund everyone's full fare and arrange for everyone to fly to Los Angeles via Calgary. This way, everyone will arrive in Los Angeles at 5 PM. If any passengers need to notify someone to pick them up, please give me the name and phone number of your contact, and we will take care of it." Then, she used the computer to inform us of the flight numbers and departure times for our connecting flights to our final destinations after arriving in Los Angeles.

I was amazed by the meticulous and efficient work of the Air Canada staff. When I boarded the plane, I found that all the passengers who were "abandoned" were arranged in the first-class cabin. During the more than 3-hour flight, the apologetic flight attendants took special care of us.

The plane landed at Los Angeles Airport, and I reluctantly walked off the Air Canada plane. Since then, I have not had the chance to fly with Air Canada again, but the good memories this airline left me with are still unforgettable.

　　难忘：蓝天里的枫叶
　　陈莉
    枫叶，是加拿大的象征。所以加拿大航空公司也用枫叶做标志。
    第一次与加拿大航空公司打交道，我还在多伦多工作，正准备去哈佛大学参加短期培训。听说提前订机票可以便宜不少，我便在两个多月前就同加航订票处联系。服务员是一位彬彬有礼的男士。他不厌其烦地回答我提的每一个问题：每天有几班飞机飞往波士顿？每班的起飞时间？到港时间？单程票价？往返票价？当我决定航班订一张机票时，他告诉我准备２３４加元，并提醒我一定要在规定日期前去取票。
    几天后我到加航取票处，向一位服务员小姐说明来意，并递过钱去。她走到微机前敲打了一阵，面带歉意地对我说：“对不起，你的机票应该是２６０加元。”
    也许是我脸上露出了惊愕之色，她随即又一番敲打，紧锁着双眉对我说：“非常抱歉，你机票的最低价格只能是２６０加元。”
    我做出无可奈何的表情，又掏出２６加元递了过去。她一边为我填写机票，一边说：“我先收你这２６块钱，你可以向我们公司的公共关系部说明这一情况。”接着她又把地址和电话号码工整地写在一张附条上交给我。
    我对写信要钱毫无兴趣，可我的一位加拿大朋友却劝我碰碰运气，并帮我写了一封短信寄了出去。
    当我结束短训从波士顿归来，一进门便看到桌上一堆信中有一封带有醒目的加航枫叶标志。拆开一看，是加航公关部的短信和一张２６块钱的支票。信中写道：“陈小姐，非常抱歉。由于我们报价时低报了２６元，给你带来了麻烦。这是我们工作上疏忽造成的，为此，我们退还你２６元。请原谅，并欢迎你再次乘坐加航。”
    看着这信和支票，我的确想了很多很多。我不知道加航在国际航空界的信誉如何，但作为一名乘客，此后只要有可能，我都选坐加航的班机。
    一家航空公司的服务质量，不仅体现在日常服务中，更反映在处理意外事件中。说来也巧，在我回国最后一次乘坐加航时，却遇上了麻烦。原来我乘坐的那班由多伦多飞往洛杉矶的客机已满员，我和１０余名乘客被“抛弃”了。这种现象在国外并不奇怪，因为航空公司为了减少空座，总要多卖出几张票，以防有些旅客临时退票。
    正当我们不知所措之时，一位加航小姐走了过来，她向大家道歉后表示：“我们公司退回各位的全程机票，并安排大家经卡尔加里飞往洛杉矶。这样各位到洛杉矶的时间是下午５点，有哪位旅客需通知对方接机的，请把亲友的电话和姓名告诉我，我们负责通知。”接着，她又通过微机将我们到洛杉矶后转乘其他飞机去目的地的航班和起飞时间都通告我们。
    我为加航职员办事的慎密细致和高效率惊叹不已。当我登上飞机，我发现我们这批被“抛弃”的旅客全都被安排在头等舱内，在３个多小时的飞行途中，面带歉意的空中小姐对我们格外照顾。
    飞机降落在洛杉矶机场，我怀着依依不舍的心情走下加航的飞机。从此之后，我没有机会再坐加航的客机，但是这家航空公司留给我的美好回忆却至今难忘。
