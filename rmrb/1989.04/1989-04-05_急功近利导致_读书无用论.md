Title: Short-term Gain Seeking Leads to the "Reading is Useless" Theory

Since the founding of the nation, there have been three instances of the "reading is useless" theory. The first was during the late 1950s when the "education revolution" was launched. At that time, authorities were criticized, and white flags were pulled down, with the reasoning that "education is detached from reality." Although the slogan "reading is useless" was not explicitly raised, this idea did exist. The second instance was during the Cultural Revolution, when "old schools" were smashed, with the reasoning that "education is detached from politics." This is the third instance, where education is again being neglected under the guise of "detaching from the needs of economic construction." In summary, each time the "reading is useless" theory arises, it has its "rationality," and the blame is always placed on education itself. To change this situation, one must adapt to certain needs. Therefore, during the late 1950s, the education revolution drastically cut back on foundational courses; during the Cultural Revolution, everything was cut; now, whatever does not bring in money is cut— but the main reason is not that someone tells you to cut, but that it cannot be sustained. It is said that this is in accordance with the value laws of a commodity economy.

The "rational" view emphasizes that education must meet societal needs, which is correct. The question is, what kind of needs should it meet? This is a question of educational guiding ideology. Education has multiple functions, and we cannot simplify education's functions with a short-term, gain-seeking perspective. We have previously stated that "education must serve proletarian politics" and "education must serve the Four Modernizations," which are both based on the tasks of a particular period to view and conduct education, without grasping the essence and fundamental task of education, which is to cultivate people and raise the overall quality of the nation. If we grasp this fundamental point and change our perspective, the question of whether education meets societal needs will yield new conclusions. Take the current situation, for example: why is there a situation where education is neglected? It is because some people emphasize that education must serve certain needs. For example, at a time when people's appetites are excessive and the trend of feasting is prevalent, those who can cater to banquets are more in need than those who engage in theoretical physics. Studying logic is also not as practical as learning Shaolin martial arts for self-defense. If education is viewed in this way, then education as a whole will lose its true purpose.

### 急功近利导致“读书无用论”

　　急功近利导致“读书无用论”
    四川教育学院  潘登榆
    建国以后，出现过３次“读书无用论”。第一次是５０年代末搞“教育革命”时。当时批“权威”，拔“白旗”，理由是“教育脱离实际”。当时虽然没有提出“读书无用”的口号，但这种思想是存在的。第二次是“文化革命”，砸烂了“旧学校”，理由是“教育脱离政治”。这是第三次，教育又在“脱离经济建设需要”的名义下受到冷遇。总之，每一次“读书无用论”的兴起都有其“合理性”，而责任都在教育本身，要改变这种状况么，就只有适应某种需要，因而５０年代末的教育革命大砍基础课，“文革”期间是全部砍，现在是看什么不来钱砍什么——但主要不是有人让你砍，而是办不下去才砍，据说这是按商品经济的价值规律办事。
    “合理论”强调教育要符合社会需要没有错，问题是符合什么样的需要，这是关于教育的指导思想问题。教育有多种职能，我们不能以急功近利的观点把教育的职能简单化。我们曾提过“教育要为无产阶级政治服务”、“教育要为四化建设服务”，这都是从一个时期的任务出发来看教育办教育，而没有抓住教育的本质和根本任务是培养人，是提高全民族的素质。如果抓住这个根本点，转换一下我们的视角，教育符合不符合社会需要的问题就会得出新的结论。就拿时下来说，为什么会产生教育受冷落的情况？就是因为有些人片面强调教育要服务于某种需要，例如在国人食欲亢进、吃喝风盛行的时刻，上红白案的就比搞理论物理的更符合需要，学逻辑学也不如学少林拳可以自卫防身。如果这样看教育，教育就整个的变了味。
