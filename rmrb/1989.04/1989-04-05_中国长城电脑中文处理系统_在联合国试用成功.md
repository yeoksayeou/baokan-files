The Chinese-designed and manufactured Great Wall computer Chinese processing system has recently been successfully trialed in relevant departments of the United Nations, with all indicators and functions meeting the design standards.

This computer Chinese processing system was jointly designed and manufactured by the Chinese Great Wall Computer Group and the Shanghai Printing Technology Research Institute. Because the system is compatible with the features of IBM computers from the United States, it can connect with IBM mainframes to form a communication network.

According to feedback from United Nations staff who used the system, the Great Wall computer Chinese processing system has the advantage of fast input speed. In addition to being able to input new characters and new vocabulary, the system also has a vocabulary storage function. A vocabulary of up to 17 characters can be input by pressing just 4 keys on the keyboard, thus increasing the input speed. Using this system, an average of 100 to 150 characters can be input per minute, which is 3 to 4 times faster than using a manual typewriter.

Relevant departments of the United Nations have decided to further test the communication functions of this system and will prepare to formally order 36 to 40 Great Wall computers and corresponding equipment, so that they can be put into official use after the opening of the United Nations General Assembly in September this year.

　　中国长城电脑中文处理系统
    在联合国试用成功
    新华社联合国４月４日电  （记者雷力利）由中国自行设计、制造的长城电脑中文处理系统最近在联合国有关部门试用成功，各项指标及功能均达到设计标准。
    这套电脑中文处理系统是由中国长城计算机集团和上海印刷技术研究所联合设计制造的。由于该系统兼容了美国ＩＢＭ公司计算机的特点，因此它可以与ＩＢＭ计算机主机连接形成通讯网络。
    据试用这套系统的联合国中文处工作人员反映，长城电脑中文处理系统的特点是输入速度较快。该系统除了可以输入新字、新词汇外，还具有词汇储备功能。一个字数长达１７个字的词汇，至多只需在字盘上打４个键即可，因此提高了输入速度。使用这套系统，平均每分钟可输入１００至１５０个字，比使用手动打字机快３至４倍。
    联合国有关部门已决定进一步试验这套系统的通讯功能，并将准备正式订购３６台至４０台长城计算机及相应设备，以便在今年９月份联合国大会开幕后正式投入使用。
