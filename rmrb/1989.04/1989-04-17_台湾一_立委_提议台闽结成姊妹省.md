Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, April 17th.

A Taiwanese "legislator" proposed that Taiwan and Fujian form a sister province relationship.

Taipei news: Taiwanese "Legislator" Shen Shixiong yesterday issued a written inquiry, proposing that the Taiwan "Executive Yuan" establish a sister province relationship with Fujian Province before the implementation of the Cross-Strait Relations Law. He suggested signing a free trade agreement to proactively safeguard the rights of Taiwanese investors.

In his inquiry, Shen Shixiong emphasized that the amount of Taiwanese investment in the mainland has significantly increased. The authorities should not ignore the existence of cross-strait economic and trade relations but should seize the opportunity to establish a free trade agreement with Fujian Province based on the current situation.

He also proposed several suggestions for free trade between the two provinces, including the free flow of goods, labor, capital, and mutual tax benefits.

　　台湾一“立委”提议台闽结成姊妹省
    新华社香港４月１７日电　台北消息：台湾“立法委员”沈世雄昨天发表书面质询，提议台湾“行政院”在海峡两岸关系法未实施之前，先行与福建省结为“姊妹省”，签订自由贸易协定，以主动积极的政策保障前往投资的台胞之权益。
    沈世雄在质询中强调，台湾民众在大陆的投资额大幅增加，当局不应无视两岸经贸关系的存在，而应把握时机与福建省基于现实状况订立自由贸易协定。
    他还提出了一些两省自由贸易的建议，包括货物流通、人力流通、资金流通、税捐互惠等。
