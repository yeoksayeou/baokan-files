International Amateur Boxing Association president Choduri recently announced in Vienna that the current judging method should be abandoned. This is because, under the current system, the audience and athletes do not know who has scored how many points before the referee raises the winning athlete's arm. Starting from 1989, the Boxing Association will trial computer scoring. When a referee confirms a hit, they press a button, and if most referees press the button, the scoreboard will display the athlete's score. The winner is then determined by the total score.

　　拳击比赛电脑计分
    国际业余拳联主席乔杜里不久前在维也纳宣布，应当放弃现行的裁判法。因为目前在裁判员举起优胜者手臂之前，观众和运动员都不知道谁得了多少分。从一九八九年起拳联将试验计算机计分，当裁判确认击中目标时，按一下电钮即可。如大多数裁判员按了电钮，计分牌上就显示出运动员得分。统计得分便可产生优胜者。
