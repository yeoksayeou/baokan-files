Do you know that in China, there is a county where the number of tourists visiting each year exceeds four times the local population?

That place is Tonglu County in Zhejiang Province.

“Rich and beautiful scenery of Fuchun River, unparalleled in the world.” This county is located by the Fuchun River. Here, the mountains are adorned with brocade, the river water is clear and blue, the rocks are steep and the caves are unique. The Song Dynasty scholar Fan Zhongyan once praised it with the words: “The scenery of Tonglu County is elegant and beautiful.”

In the past, Tonglu, which is only 90 kilometers away from Hangzhou, had a low profile. Few tourists who came to West Lake would come here to visit. However, with the development of the tourism industry, Tonglu has become famous. More than 60 countries and regions have left their footprints here. In 1987, Tonglu County, with a population of over 300,000, received more than 1.4 million domestic and foreign tourists, winning the title of the best county-level tourism destination in China for two consecutive years. Tonglu County has become a hot spot on the western Zhejiang Golden Tourism Line.

When asked about this change, Deputy County Magistrate Gao Deren said, “It is the reform and opening-up policy that has made Tonglu people change their old ideas, broaden their horizons, and find a new breakthrough for revitalizing the local economy: making full use of the unique natural scenery to vigorously develop the ‘smokeless industry.’”

Nature has been generous here. The cave “Yao Lin Fairyland” is known as the “best cave in the country”; the Eastern Han Dynasty site of Yan Zi Ling’s Fishing Platform combines the beauty of the Li River and the danger of the Three Gorges. The human landscape here is also unique. It is said that Tong Jun, the ancestor of Chinese medicine, picked herbs here during the time of the Yellow Emperor. The place where he built his hut to refine elixirs, Tong Jun Mountain, is also here. This is probably the origin of the name Tonglu County.

To develop the tourism industry, Tonglu County has made a firm decision to raise funds to build a number of hotels, restaurants, and other tourism facilities, to equip tourism vehicles, and to set up special tourism lines to Hangzhou, Thousand Island Lake, and Huangshan. On the Fuchun River, there are comfortable boats for sightseeing...

The development of the tourism industry has connected the secluded county of Tonglu with the outside world and has also promoted the development of the county's economy. Here, not only do tens of thousands of tourists come every year, but also capital and talent. Enterprises and hotels from Shanghai and other places have been established in Tonglu, and foreign businessmen have come here to discuss joint ventures. Traditional textile and silk industries have seen new developments in recent years, and the tertiary industry has also flourished. The honest and simple people of Tonglu have embarked on the road to prosperity, and the per capita income of the county has exceeded 1,000 yuan.

Now, they are considering how to better combine the development of tourism with the promotion of excellent national culture. Since this is the ancestral land of Tong Jun, the ancestor of Chinese medicine, and since some precious Chinese herbs are produced here, why not turn them into important tourism content? When tourists, especially foreign visitors, come here, they can not only learn about the development history of traditional Chinese medicine and increase their cultural knowledge, but they can also buy famous Chinese patent medicines. How wonderful that would be! Deputy County Magistrate Gao told the reporter that it is out of this consideration that they have decided to hold the “First National Chinese Medicine Festival” in Tonglu County from May 2 to 8 this year. At that time, their tourism industry will reach a new level.

　　桐庐——县级旅游之冠
　　·这里将举办首届华夏中药节·
　　本报记者　王锦鹄
    你知道吗，我国有一个县，每年去那里旅游的人数超过本县人口的4倍？
    那就是浙江省桐庐县。
    “富春山水、天下独绝”。此县就在富春江畔。这里锦峰绣岭，江水碧澄，岩石奇峭，溶洞奇绝。宋朝范仲淹曾有诗赞曰：“潇洒桐庐郡、江山景物妍”。
    昔日，距杭州只有90公里的桐庐，知名度却很低，慕名西子湖的游客，很少顺便到这里观光。而今天，随着旅游业的发展，桐庐声名在外，曾有60多个国家和地区的朋友们在这里留下足迹。1987年，30多万人口的桐庐县，接待了中外游客140多万人次，在旅游效益上，连续两年夺取了全国县级之冠。桐庐县已成为浙西黄金旅游线上的热点。
    谈起这一变化，副县长高德仁说，这是改革开放的大气候使桐庐人改变了旧观念，打开了思路，开阔了眼界，他们才找到了振兴地方经济的一个新的突破口：充分利用得天独厚的自然景观优势，大力发展“无烟工业”。
    自然界的赐予是慷慨的，这里的溶洞“瑶琳仙境”被誉为“全国诸洞冠”；这里的东汉古迹严子陵钓台兼有“漓江之美、三峡之险”。而这里的人文景观也独具一格。相传是华夏中药鼻祖的桐君，在黄帝时代曾在此采药，他结庐炼丹之处的桐君山也在这里。这恐怕是桐庐县县名的由来。
    为了发展旅游业，桐庐县下了决心，自筹资金，建设了一批宾馆、饭店等旅游设施，配置了旅游车，专设了去杭州、千岛湖、黄山的旅游专线。在富春江上，有舒适的泛江游览船队……
    旅游业的发展，使闭塞的桐庐小县与外界联系起来了，也带动了全县经济的发展。这里，不仅每年招徕了众多的游客，也招徕了资金和人才。上海等地的单位在桐庐办起了企业、饭店，外商到这里洽谈合资经营项目。传统的纺织、丝绸业近年有了新的发展，第三产业也兴旺起来了。淳厚朴实的桐庐人走上了富裕之路，全县人均收入已超过千元。
    现在，他们又在考虑如何把发展旅游业同弘扬优秀的民族文化更好地结合起来。这里既然是华夏药祖桐君的故地，又盛产一些名贵的中草药，为什么不把它们变成重要的旅游内容呢？当游客，特别是国外观光者来到这里，他们既可以了解中医中药的发展历史，增加文化知识，又可以买到中国著名的中草成药，将是一件多么惬意的事情啊！高副县长告诉记者，正是出于这样的设想，他们已经决定，今年5月2日至8日，在桐庐县举办“首届华夏中药节”，那时，他们的旅游业将提高到一个新的层次。
