The Soviet Union spans both Europe and Asia, with its political, economic, and social life centered around its European part. The Far East region, which borders the Pacific Ocean, has long been considered its remote frontier, with extremely slow economic development. The labor productivity there is 15 to 20 percent lower than in the western regions. The share of industrial production in the national economy was 2.8 percent in 1958 and only 3 percent in 1986. The total industrial output of the Far East accounts for only 0.7 percent of the Asia-Pacific region, which is one-fifteenth of the total output of the U.S. states along the Pacific coast and only one-thirtieth of Japan's. How to change this sluggish situation has become a major issue for the Soviet Union.

In July 1986, Gorbachev visited the Far East and proposed a development plan for Siberia and the Far East, shifting from the long-standing inward-looking development strategy to a more open approach. This indicated the Soviet Union's urgent desire to join the "international division of labor in the Asia-Pacific region." In 1987, the Soviet Union formulated a long-term development plan for the Far East, with an estimated investment of approximately 200 billion rubles. The plan aims to double the growth rate of commodity production by the year 2000, increase electricity generation by 1.6 times, and increase natural gas extraction by six to eight times. The plan also aims to double the volume of foreign economic trade and reform the export structure, shifting from traditional exports like timber, coal, and seafood to primarily exporting finished and semi-finished products. The focus of foreign economic relations is to shift from simple trade to a combination of trade and economic cooperation.

To achieve these goals, the Soviet Union has decided to establish free economic zones in the Far East, offering tax incentives and preferential policies on tariffs and profit taxes, and providing natural and labor resources at low prices. Internally, it will expand the autonomy of local governments and enterprises, allowing enterprises, groups, and production cooperatives to enter the international market directly with the approval of the border or regional executive committees. Local governments and enterprises can retain and independently manage a portion of their foreign exchange earnings. The Soviet Maritime Territory is no longer a restricted area, and the Soviet Union plans to develop the military stronghold of Vladivostok into an international economic and cultural exchange center.

To make up for the shortage of funds, technology, and labor, the Soviet Union is opening its doors to Japan and other neighboring countries. It has already begun to accept labor services from China and North Korea and plans to cooperate with China in agricultural and civilian construction projects. Gorbachev hopes that the tripartite cooperation plan involving the Soviet Union, Japan, and China can be quickly implemented. Economic relations between the Soviet Union and Japan are expanding, with the two countries achieving a record-high trade volume last year. They have established several joint ventures. Japan, in collaboration with some American companies, is building a large-scale chemical base in Western Siberia. Additionally, since last year, the Soviet Union's economic contacts with South Korea have been noteworthy. The three major South Korean conglomerates, "Daewoo," "Samsung," and "Lucky-Goldstar," have decided to participate in the development of Siberia. In early this year, the leader of the South Korean "Hyundai" group visited Moscow and reached an agreement with the Soviet Chamber of Commerce on joint development of Siberia and the Far East. Subsequently, he visited Pyongyang. According to the Korean Central News Agency, the two sides reached an agreement to jointly participate in the Soviet development project. This will be the first economic cooperation between North and South Korea abroad. The Soviet Union has also established the "International Tender Company" with the United States, covering operations from the Maritime Territory to the western regions. It is also actively engaging in economic exchanges with ASEAN and countries like Australia and New Zealand.

It is evident that the Soviet Union is taking advantage of the current easing of international tensions and the rise of the Asia-Pacific economy to actively develop the Far East and seek a place in the international division of labor in the Asia-Pacific region. Additionally, leveraging its strong maritime transport capabilities and two east-west transcontinental railways, it aims to serve as a bridge connecting the economies of Europe and Asia.

### 苏联正向亚太开放

　　苏联正向亚太开放
　　周象光
    苏联国土横跨欧亚两洲，政治、经济和社会生活以欧洲部分为中心，濒临太平洋的远东地区，一直被视为它的遥远边陲，经济开发极为缓慢，其劳动生产率比西部地区低百分之十五到百分之二十，工业生产在全国所占比重，一九五八年为百分之二点八，一九八六年只达到百分之三。远东工业生产总值只占亚太地区的百分之零点七，相当于美国太平洋沿岸各州的十五分之一，只及日本的三十分之一。如何改变这种滞缓状况，成为苏联面临的一大课题。
    一九八六年七月，戈尔巴乔夫视察远东时，提出西伯利亚和远东地区的发展构想，改变了苏联长期奉行的封闭式内向型的地区发展战略，表露苏联要加入“亚太地区国际分工体系”的迫切希望。一九八七年，苏联制订了远东地区长期发展纲要，计划投资总额约二千亿卢布，使商品生产增长速度到二○○○年提高一倍半，发电量增长一点六倍，天然气开采量增长六至八倍，对外经济贸易额增长二倍；并且改革出口结构，除传统的木材、煤炭和海产品外，增加石油、天然气出口，逐步过渡到以成品和半成品出口为主；对外经济联系拟由单纯贸易方式转向贸易与经济合作并重。
    为实现上述目标，苏联决定在远东设立自由经济特区，将对关税、利润所得税等实行优惠，低价提供自然资源和劳动力资源。对内则扩大地方政府和企业自主权，企业、团体、生产合作社经边疆区或州执委会批准可直接进入国际市场，地方政府和企业可从外汇收入中提取留成，自行支配。苏联滨海边疆区已不再是禁区，苏联还将把军事要塞海参威发展成为国际经济文化交流中心。
    为弥补资金、技术和劳力的不足，苏联正将大门向日本和其它邻近国家打开。它已开始从中、朝两国接受劳务，将同中国在农业和民用项目建设上进行合作。戈尔巴乔夫希望，有关日、中、苏三方合作开发的设想能尽快从研究“转入实际方面”。苏日之间的经济关系不断扩大，去年两国贸易额创历史最高纪录。两国已建立了一批合资企业。日本还联合美国的一些公司在西西伯利亚兴建大型化工基地。此外，从去年起，苏联同南朝鲜经济界的接触令人瞩目。南朝鲜“大宇”、“三星”、“乐喜金星”三大财团已决定参加开发西伯利亚。今年年初，南朝鲜“现代”集团领导人访问莫斯科，同苏联工商会就联合开发西伯利亚和远东达成协议，接着，他又访问了平壤。据朝中社报道，双方就共同参加苏联开发事业达成了协议。这将是朝鲜北南双方首次在国外进行的经济合作。苏联还同美国组建了“国际投标公司”，其经营范围从滨海边疆直到西部地区。它同东盟和澳、新等国的经济往来也在积极进行。
    看得出来，苏联正在利用当前世界形势缓和以及亚太经济崛起为它提供的良好国际环境，积极开发远东，谋求在亚太经济国际分工体系中占有一席之地；并且借助于自己雄厚的海运实力和两条横贯东西的铁路干线，试图充当连结欧亚经济的桥梁。
