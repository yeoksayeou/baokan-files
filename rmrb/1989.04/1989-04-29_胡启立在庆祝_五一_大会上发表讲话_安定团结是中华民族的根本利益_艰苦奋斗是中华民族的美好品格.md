Comrades and friends,

On the occasion of the International Labor Day, we gather here to celebrate the glorious holiday of the working class and laboring people around the world. On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, I extend warm greetings and festive wishes to all workers, peasants, intellectuals, soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, and all laborers of all ethnic groups in our country, to our compatriots in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, and to our overseas compatriots who love our country. I also extend a warm welcome to the foreign guests attending today's meeting.

Over the past decade of reform and opening up, our country has undergone tremendous changes and achieved remarkable results. Although we face many difficulties and problems on our way forward, history has proven that the policies and guidelines of reform and opening up are correct, and our cause is full of hope. The Chinese working class, together with the people of the entire nation, has worked diligently, bravely reformed, and made significant contributions to the revitalization of the nation and the progress of society, writing a glorious chapter. Practice has shown that the Chinese working class is indeed the leading class of our country and the main force of reform and construction!

Over the past decade, we have been able to achieve such great results primarily because we have resolutely implemented the line, principles, and policies of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, adhered to the Four Cardinal Principles as the foundation of the state, and maintained a stable and united political situation. In the historical process of socialist modernization construction, maintaining a stable political and social environment by relying on the people is a major issue that concerns the overall situation. The Chinese people, who have suffered from the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution for a decade, deeply understand that stability and unity are the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation. Small matters must yield to big matters. Maintaining stability and preventing turmoil is a big matter. Without social stability, reform, opening up, and construction will not succeed, and the achievements we have already made will be lost. The working class and all laborers are the mainstay and backbone of our society, playing a very important role in economic prosperity and social stability. The Party and the government deeply appreciate you! The people deeply appreciate you! On this occasion, I, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Party and the State Council, extend cordial greetings to the broad masses of workers and all laborers who are steadfast in their posts and work selflessly! We believe that in the future practice of reform and construction, the broad masses of laborers will continue to adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, adhere to reform and opening up, put the overall situation first, take the lead in observing laws and regulations, consciously safeguard the authority of the Party and the government, maintain good production, learning, and living order, and consolidate and develop the hard-won situation of stability and unity.

Comrades, building a prosperous, democratic, and civilized socialist modernized country is our goal. Without democracy and the rule of law, there is no socialism. We emphasize stability and unity, but this does not mean we do not advocate democracy. Stability and unity are the prerequisites for promoting democratic political construction, while advocating democracy and improving the legal system are powerful guarantees for stability and unity. While actively promoting economic system reform, we will continue to firmly and practically promote democratic political construction, gradually institutionalizing and legalizing socialist democracy and politics. Enhancing the sense of participation among the broad masses of workers, strengthening democratic management in enterprises and institutions, is an important part of building socialist democratic politics, and is also a specific manifestation of the status of the broad masses of workers as masters of the country. We must fully respect the democratic rights of the masses of workers, improve the system of workers' congresses, establish and improve various channels for democratic dialogue, and consciously accept the criticism and supervision of the masses of workers. The masses of workers should correctly exercise their democratic rights, offer suggestions for running enterprises well, and display the creative spirit of masters in reform, opening up, and modernization construction.

Hard work has always been a fine tradition of the Chinese nation, a fine tradition of our Party, and the political character of the Chinese working class. Today, the reform and construction we are engaged in is a great cause that is both arduous and complex, requiring the efforts of several generations. Therefore, maintaining and carrying forward the spirit of hard work should become a good tradition and spiritual state of the entire nation. We should form a strong public opinion of hard work throughout society. Party and government organs and leading cadres at all levels should take the lead in boosting spirits and working hard, which has a great influence and exemplary role on the whole society. Party and government cadres should first strictly discipline themselves, be honest and upright, advocate frugality, and work diligently. At the same time, we should advocate a good style of thrift, simplicity, and careful calculation among all the people, and oppose the outdated customs of showing off, comparing wealth, and extravagant waste. The more the economy develops and the more life improves, the more we should pay attention to boosting spirits and working hard. Each enterprise, especially large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, should focus on internal management during the rectification and deepening of reform, further tap potential, and contribute more to the country. On the eve of National Day this year, the State Council will hold a national conference to commend labor models and advanced workers. The Central Committee of the Party and the State Council hope that workers, peasants, intellectuals, soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, and other laborers across the country will make contributions to the rectification and deepening of reform, build socialism, and create more heroes and models.

May 1st is the holiday of laborers. The honorable Chinese working class will certainly add new luster to the banner of "Revitalizing China and Realizing the Four Modernizations" with even better labor achievements!

Thank you all!

　　胡启立在庆祝“五一”大会上发表讲话   
    安定团结是中华民族的根本利益    
    艰苦奋斗是中华民族的美好品格
    同志们、朋友们：
    在“五一”国际劳动节到来的时候，我们在这里欢聚一堂，共同庆祝全世界工人阶级和劳动人民的光辉节日。我代表中共中央和国务院，向全国各族工人、农民、知识分子、解放军指战员和全体劳动者，向台湾、港澳同胞和侨居国外的爱国同胞，向光临今天大会的外国来宾，致以亲切的问候和节日的祝贺！
    我国实行改革开放十年来，国家面貌发生了巨大的变化，取得了显著的成就。尽管我们在前进的道路上面临着不少困难和问题，但历史已经证明，改革、开放的方针和路线是正确的，我们的事业充满着希望。中国工人阶级同全国人民一起，勤奋劳动，勇于改革，为民族振兴和社会进步作出了重大贡献，谱写了光辉的篇章。实践表明，中国工人阶级不愧为我国的领导阶级，不愧为改革和建设的主力军！
    十年来，我们所以能够取得巨大的成就，从根本上讲是由于坚决地贯彻了党的十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针和政策，坚持了四项基本原则这个立国之本，保持了安定团结的政治局面。在社会主义现代化建设的历史进程中，紧紧地依靠人民群众维护稳定的政治和社会环境，始终是一个事关全局的重大问题。饱受十年文革动乱之苦的我国人民深知，安定团结是中华民族的根本利益之所在。小道理要服从大道理。保持稳定，防止动乱，就是一条大道理。离开了社会稳定，改革、开放、建设，什么都搞不成，已经取得的成果也会丧失掉。工人阶级和全体劳动者是我们社会的主体和中坚，在经济繁荣和社会稳定中起了十分重要的作用，党和政府深切地感谢你们！人民深切地感谢你们！借此机会，我代表党中央和国务院，向坚守岗位、忘我工作的广大职工和全体劳动者表示亲切地慰问！我们相信，在今后的改革和建设的实践中，广大劳动群众一定能够继续坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，以大局为重，带头遵纪守法，自觉维护党和政府的领导权威，维护良好的生产、学习和生活秩序，巩固和发展来之不易的安定团结局面。
    同志们，建设富强、民主、文明的社会主义现代化国家，是我们的奋斗目标。没有民主法制，就没有社会主义。我们强调安定团结，并不是不要发扬民主。安定团结是推进民主政治建设的前提，而发扬民主、健全法制，又是安定团结的有力保证。我们要在积极推进经济体制改革的同时，继续坚定不移地、扎扎实实地推进民主政治建设，使社会主义民主政治逐步制度化、法律化。增强广大职工的参与意识，加强企业事业单位的民主管理，是建设社会主义民主政治的重要组成部分，也是广大职工群众主人翁地位的具体体现。要充分尊重职工群众的民主权利，健全职工代表大会制度，建立和健全多种民主对话渠道，自觉接受职工群众的批评和监督。职工群众要正确行使自己的民主权利，为办好企业献计献策，在改革开放和现代化建设中发挥主人翁的创造精神。
    艰苦奋斗历来是中华民族的美好品格，是我们党的优良传统，也是中国工人阶级的政治本色。今天，我们从事的改革和建设，是一项十分艰巨而复杂的伟大事业，要靠几代人的努力。因此，保持和发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，应当成为我们全民族的一种良好风尚和精神状态。要在全社会范围形成艰苦奋斗的强大舆论。党政机关和各级领导干部带头振奋精神、艰苦奋斗，对全社会有着极大的影响和示范作用。党政干部首先要严于律己，廉洁奉公，反奢崇俭，勤奋工作。同时也要在全体人民中倡导节俭、朴素、精打细算的良好风气，反对讲排场、比阔气、铺张浪费的陈俗陋习。越是经济发展，越是生活改善，越要注意振奋精神、艰苦奋斗。各个企业特别是国营大中型企业，在整顿治理、深化改革中，要狠抓内部管理，进一步挖掘潜力，为国家多做贡献。今年国庆前夕，国务院将召开全国劳动模范和先进工作者表彰大会。党中央和国务院希望全国工人、农民、知识分子、解放军指战员和其他劳动者，为治理整顿、深化改革作出贡献，为社会主义现代化建功立业，涌现更多的英雄模范人物。
    “五一”是劳动者的节日，具有光荣传统的中国工人阶级，必将以更加优异的劳动成果，为“振兴中华，实现四化”的旗帜增添新的光彩！
　　　谢谢大家！
