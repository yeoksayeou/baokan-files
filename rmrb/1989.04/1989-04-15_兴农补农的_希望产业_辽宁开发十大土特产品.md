Liaoning Province is systematically developing ten major local specialties, including black fungus and apples, as "hope industries" to open up a path for revitalizing and supplementing agriculture.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Shenyang on April 14, Liaoning Province has a per capita arable land of only 1.37 mu (approximately 0.23 acres), which is below the national average. The limited arable land is decreasing year by year, while the agricultural labor force is increasing at an average rate of 150,000 people per year. How to reduce the burden on the "one and a half mu of land"? Since 1988, the Liaoning Provincial Government has gathered wisdom and selected hawthorn, sea buckthorn, black fungus, apples, ginseng deep processing, and marine product cultivation as ten development projects with rich resources, relatively low investment, and significant benefits. These projects are organized to be implemented in various places as "hope industries" to revitalize and supplement agriculture.

According to the plan, the output value of these ten industries will exceed 100 million yuan or 1 billion yuan respectively after 3 to 5 years of development. The new special product taxes generated by the ten major "hope industries" will be used as local agricultural development funds. Agricultural experts say that the development of the ten major "hope industries" not only provides considerable funds for agriculture but also opens up employment opportunities for the surplus labor force in rural areas.

　　辽宁开发十大土特产品
    据新华社沈阳４月１４日电　（记者张民华）辽宁省正在有计划地开发当地特产黑木耳、苹果等１０大“希望产业”，力求开辟一条兴农补农之路。
    辽宁省人均耕地仅１．３７亩，低于全国平均水平；有限的耕地逐年减少而农业劳动力却以年均１５万人的速度激增。怎样减少“一亩半地”负荷？从１９８８年起，辽宁省政府集思广益，选定山楂、沙棘、黑木耳、苹果、人参深加工、海珍品养殖等１０个资源丰富、投资较少、效益显著的开发项目作为兴农补农的“希望产业”，组织各地具体实施。
    根据规划，这１０项产业经过３至５年的开发，其产值将分别超过１０００万元或１亿元。１０大“希望产业”新增的特产税将作为地方农业发展基金。农业专家们说，１０大“希望产业”的开发不仅能提供可观的补农资金，还能为农村剩余劳动力开辟就业门路。
