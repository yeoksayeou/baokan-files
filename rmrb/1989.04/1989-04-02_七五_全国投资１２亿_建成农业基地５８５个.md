During the first three years of the "Seventh Five-Year Plan," the country invested 120 million yuan to establish 585 agricultural commodity production bases (counties or projects). This information was obtained by reporters from the national agricultural commodity production base work conference currently being held in Kunming.

By the end of 1988, the construction of agricultural commodity production bases, which were funded by both the state and local governments, had been basically completed during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan."

The established agricultural bases can be divided into four types: First, 111 commercial grain production base counties were established. Second, 74 high-quality cotton production base counties were established. In addition, 113 high-quality fruit and other agricultural and sideline product production bases were established, and 287 special and unique product production projects were established.

Currently, the national agricultural department is already studying the construction of the second batch of agricultural commodity production bases. It has been preliminarily decided that the construction of the second batch of agricultural commodity production bases will focus on the northwestern dryland farming regions, southern rice production regions, and provinces and autonomous regions that import a large amount of grain.

　　“七五”全国投资１２亿　建成农业基地５８５个
    据新华社昆明４月１日电  （记者谭亚原、严文斌）“七五”期间前三年，全国投资１２亿元，建设起农业商品生产基地５８５个县（或项目）。这是记者从正在昆明召开的全国农业商品生产基地工作会上了解到的。
    “七五”期间，国家投资、地方配套的农业商品生产基地建设，到１９８８年底已初步完成。
    已建成的农业基地可分为四种类型：一是建成１１１个商品粮生产基地县。二是建成了７４个优质棉花生产基地县。此外，还建成优质水果等农副产品生产基地１１３个；各种名特产品生产项目２８７个。
    目前，国家农业部门已着手研究建设第二批农业商品生产基地。初步决定，第二批农业商品生产基地的建设，将侧重放在西北旱作农业地区、南方水稻生产地区和粮食调入较多省区。
