My daughter is in the fourth grade at a certain school. In her class, most of the students' rest and activity time is used to complete homework. After the teacher finishes each class, it is almost time for the next class. The teacher does not leave much time for homework in class, so students have to complete it during breaks. The weekly schedule includes five extracurricular activities, but it is already good if one or two of these activities are actually implemented. During lunch, apart from the time for eating, there is about an hour of rest and activity time. Various subject teachers compete to take this time, often with Chinese, mathematics, and science all happening at once, bombarding the students. The students are afraid of not completing their homework and being criticized, so they rush to finish it before and after meals. Sometimes, they don't get any rest during the entire lunch break. On weekends, the time students can manage on their own is very limited. Due to the heavy workload, by the time the homework is completed, there is very little time left. Sometimes, it is even more hectic than during school hours.

The school and teachers' task is to cultivate students' comprehensive development in morality, intelligence, and physical fitness. Think about it, if students do not have a clear learning purpose, a healthy body, a strong interest in learning, and abundant energy, how can we talk about intelligence? Please return the rest and activity time that has been occupied by the school and teachers to the students!

　　请归还学生休息活动时间
    女儿在某校四年级一班就读。该班将学生的休息、活动时间，大部分用来做作业。老师讲完每节课后，已到或接近下课，课堂上不留或少留作业时间，让学生课间完成。课程表上每周有五节课外活动，而真正能落实一二节就很不错了。中午除吃饭时间外，尚有一小时左右的休息活动时间。各课任老师争着瓜分，常常是语文、数学、自然三管齐下，轮番“轰炸”。学生怕完不成作业受批评，抓紧饭前饭后做。有时整个中午不休息也难以完成。星期天和星期六，由学生自己支配的时间甚少。由于作业压的太多，等作业完成后，所剩时间寥寥无几。有时竟比上课还紧张。
    学校和老师的任务是培养学生德、智、体全面发展，试想，如果学生没有明确的学习目的，健康的体魄，浓厚的学习兴趣和充沛的精力，智又从何谈起。请学校和老师把占用的休息活动时间归还学生吧！
