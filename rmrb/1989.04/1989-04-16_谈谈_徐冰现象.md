Column: Hundred Artists' Talk

Xu Bing's printmaking work "Analysis of the World—End of the Century Volume" has been exhibited, drawing the attention of readers and eliciting varied responses to its novel form and content. I believe that the appearance of "Analysis of the World" is significant. At the very least, it shows that young people who are diligent in thinking and brave in exploring are no longer satisfied with merely imitating and transplanting Western modern art, nor are they satisfied with the superficial effects of artistic creation. They delve into the depths of Western modern art, understand its essence, explore its mysteries, but do not idolize or blindly follow. They also seriously reflect on their own national culture, researching why there is such a large gap between it and the West, and what paths can be taken to modernize it. They understand that art is a part of social culture, but it also has its own characteristics. While we critically reflect on traditional culture, we cannot arbitrarily discard the essence of traditional art. Traditional art, after our transformation and imbuing it with modern concepts and consciousness, will gain new vitality. Especially when "conceptual art" from the West is being fervently pursued by some young people, Xu Bing's mind remains very clear. Conceptual art, which aims to explore the essence of art, is not about not designing, not about craftsmanship, not about skill, and certainly not about doing whatever one wants and however one wants. At any time, artistic creation and artistic activities include both concepts and skills. Artists are craftsmen with thoughts. Xu Bing has undergone rigorous academic training, but by nature, he is a rebel against the academy. Because he is not satisfied with just following the crowd, he always asks "why" during his creation. Usually, when you listen to him speak, it's like listening to a philosopher narrating his thought process, full of dialectics, pros and cons. Xu Bing is also a hands-on person. He is passionate about all kinds of manual labor and craftsmanship, finding endless joy in it. His printmaking work "Analysis of the World—End of the Century Volume" is entirely composed of printed text symbols. The more than 2,000 fake movable type characters he invented were all carved out by him one by one. What a laborious manual task! No wonder someone calls him "Crazy Xu." He then randomly combines these forged characters and repeatedly prints them, forming twelve large-scale images, hanging from the ceiling and occupying three walls. The space formed by these images gives people a sense of solemnity and mystery, with a strong visual psychological effect. People in this vast space, in front of these "heavenly books" that they cannot understand, will feel the power and pressure of traditional culture. People in front of these characters with special structural beauty will also realize the dignity and charm of Chinese characters. Yes, he is criticizing Chinese traditional culture, but within the criticism, there is also praise. He created an absurd artistic entity, leading people into a "labyrinth," but also hinting at how to get out of this confusing world. In the process of studying this work that cannot be read or understood, people will naturally enter a state of contemplation, naturally receive artistic cultivation, and even experience the joy of recreating.

Xu Bing's work has gained many appreciators, but it has also received criticism from two sides. Those who do not want to study avant-garde art say that Xu Bing has deviated from tradition; those with nihilistic views and who advocate completely learning from the West say that he is too traditional. Personally, I am deeply impressed by Xu Bing's wisdom, courage, and skill, and I admire how he seamlessly integrates Western rational analysis, absurd consciousness, and the essence of traditional art. Where will Xu Bing go from here?

I believe he will continue to advance and create new realms, because I see in him a rare tenacity and self-control that young people possess.

　　谈谈“徐冰现象”
　　邵大箴
    徐冰的版画作品《析世鉴——世纪末卷》展出之后，引起了读者的重视，且对其新奇的形式和内容反映不一。我认为，《析世鉴》的出现是有意义的。它至少说明，勤于思考、勇于探索的青年人已经不满足于对西方现代文艺的模仿和移植，不满足于艺术创作的表面效果。他们深入到西方现代美术的深处，理解其精髓，探索其奥秘，但不迷信，不盲从；他们更深入地对本民族的文化作着认真的思考，研究本民族文化何以与西方有如此大的差距，用何种途径才能使其现代化。他们懂得，艺术是社会文化的一部分，但它自身又有其特点。在我们对传统文化进行批判性反思的同时，不能随心所欲地抛弃传统艺术中的精华。传统艺术经过我们的改造，经过我们赋予现代的观念和意识，会获得新的生命力。尤其当西方的“观念艺术”正在为部分青年人狂热地迷恋时，徐冰的头脑却非常冷静。旨在探索艺术实质的“观念艺术”，并非不要设计，不要匠心，不要技艺，更不是想干什么就干什么，想怎样干就怎样干。任何时候，艺术创作和艺术活动包含着观念和技艺。艺术家是有思想的手艺人。徐冰经过严格的学院训练，但从本性上他是学院派的叛逆儿。因为他不满足于人云亦云，他在从事创作时总要不断地问“为什么”。平常你听他说话，就像听一位哲人在叙述自己思考的过程，正正反反，反反正正，充满辩证法。徐冰又是爱动手的人，他醉心于一切手艺劳动和手艺操作，从中得到无穷的乐趣。他创作的版画作品《析世鉴——世纪末卷》，全部由板刻的文字符号铺排印制而成。由他杜撰的二千多个活版伪字，全是由他一个个地刻出来的。多艰巨的手工劳动！难怪有人说他是“徐疯子”。他又把这些伪造的字随意组合，重复印刷，组成十二个巨幅画面，悬垂于屋顶和占据三个壁面。由这些画面组成的空间，给人庄严和神秘的感觉，有强烈的视觉心理效果。人们在这巨大的空间里，在这些读不懂的“天书”前面，会感受到传统文化的威力和压力。人们在这些具有特殊结构美的文字前面，又意识到中国文字的尊严和魅力。是的，他是在批判中国传统文化，但在批判中又有赞美。他创造了一个荒谬的艺术实体，把人引入“迷宫”，但又暗示人们走出这迷离的世界。人们在研读这部读不懂和读不通的作品过程中，会自然而然地进入思考的境地，自然而然地受到艺术的熏陶，甚至会领受到重新创造的喜悦。
    徐冰的作品得到了众多的知音，也受到了来自两方面的批评。对新潮艺术不愿作任何研究的人，说徐冰背离了传统；有虚无主义和主张彻头彻尾学西方的人则说他太传统。我个人既深为徐冰的智慧、胆识和技巧所折服，更赞叹他能如此地把西方的理性分析、荒谬意识和传统艺术的精华如此天衣无缝地融为一体。今后徐冰往何处去？
    我相信他还会继续前进创造出新的天地，因为我在他身上看到一种青年人难得的执著劲和自控意识。
