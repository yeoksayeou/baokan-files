Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 8th.

According to a broadcast by the Democratic Kampuchea radio station today, Democratic Kampuchea Vice Chairman Chea Sim issued a statement on April 6th saying that Vietnam's unilateral announcement on April 5th of a complete withdrawal from Cambodia by September this year is "deceptive propaganda," aimed at continuing the occupation of Cambodia.

Chea Sim said that if Vietnam's withdrawal is not carried out under effective international supervision, then it is not a genuine withdrawal.

Therefore, the coalition government of Democratic Kampuchea, the Cambodian people, and all resistance forces do not recognize this so-called unilateral withdrawal.

Chea Sim said that Vietnam is attempting to evade international supervision in order to retain troops in Cambodia under the guise of withdrawal, continue the occupation of Cambodia, and try to deceive the world by saying, "This is a civil war."

Chea Sim called on the international community to continue supporting Prince Sihanouk's five-point peace plan for a political solution to the Cambodian problem. He said that only by resolving the Cambodian issue according to this peace plan can Cambodia truly achieve national reconciliation and truly restore peace.

The reporter received a statement from Son Sann, Prime Minister of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, on the 8th, welcoming Vietnam's recent announcement of withdrawing from Cambodia by September 1989, while demanding that Vietnam withdraw under international supervision.

In his statement, Son Sann proposed that the Hanoi authorities should notify the United Nations Secretary-General of their plans to withdraw from Cambodia, so that he can consult with the Security Council on the issue of dispatching United Nations peacekeeping forces or international monitoring agencies to Cambodia.

Son Sann also demanded that the Hanoi authorities abandon their attempts to confuse the nature of the Cambodian war and their plans to separate the domestic and international aspects of the Cambodian issue.

Currently in Paris, Son Sann signed this statement on April 5th in his capacity as Prime Minister of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea and Chairman of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front.

Democratic Kampuchea's Ambassador to the United Nations, Thun Sarath, said today that Vietnam's announcement of withdrawal from Cambodia is "conditional" and not "unconditional" as Hanoi claims.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 8th.

Singapore News: A spokesperson for the Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on the 7th that Vietnam's announcement of a complete withdrawal from Cambodia by the end of September this year should be carried out under effective United Nations supervision.

The spokesperson said that Vietnam's withdrawal cannot be subject to its own conditions. Objective recognition of Vietnam's withdrawal is very important.

He said that Singapore agrees with Prince Sihanouk's proposal that Vietnam cannot unilaterally decide the composition and role of the international monitoring agency.

He emphasized that the international monitoring agency should verify Vietnam's current troop strength in Cambodia and monitor the withdrawal process to prevent Vietnamese troops from remaining in Cambodia in disguise.

He said that only under effective international supervision can hostilities in Cambodia be stopped, prevent any one faction from seizing power, and organize fair elections in Cambodia.

The spokesperson also reiterated Singapore's stance that the future government of Cambodia should be composed of the three factions of Democratic Kampuchea and the Phnom Penh regime.

　　乔森潘说越撤军是欺骗性宣传  宋双要求越在国际监督下撤军
    新加坡强调对越从柬撤军的客观认可十分重要
    新华社北京４月８日电  据民主柬埔寨电台今天广播，民主柬埔寨副主席乔森潘４月６日发表声明说，越南４月５日单方面宣布今年９月从柬埔寨全部撤军是“欺骗性宣传”，其目的是要继续侵占柬埔寨。
    乔森潘说，越南宣布的撤军，如果不在有效的国际监督下进行的话，那就不是真撤军。
    因此，民柬联合政府、柬埔寨人民和全部抵抗力量不承认这种所谓的单方面撤军。
    乔森潘说，越南企图逃避国际监督，是为了在撤军的幌子下继续在柬埔寨保留军队，继续侵占柬埔寨，并试图欺骗世界说，“这是一场内战。”
    乔森潘呼吁国际社会继续支持西哈努克亲王提出的政治解决柬埔寨问题的５点和平计划。他说，只有根据这个和平计划解决柬埔寨问题，柬埔寨才能真正实现民族和解，才能真正恢复和平。
    新华社巴黎４月８日电　（记者沈孝泉）本社记者８日收到民柬联合政府总理宋双的一份声明，对越南最近宣布的在１９８９年９月之前从柬埔寨撤军的决定表示欢迎，同时要求越南在国际监督之下撤军。
    宋双在声明中提出，河内当局应该把从柬埔寨撤军的计划通知联合国秘书长，使之就开始向柬埔寨派遣联合国维持和平部队或国际监督机构问题同安理会进行磋商。
    宋双还要求河内当局放弃混淆侵柬战争性质的企图，以及准备把柬埔寨问题的国内方面和国际方面隔裂开来的打算。
    目前正在巴黎的宋双是４月５日以民柬联合政府总理和高棉人民民族解放阵线主席的身份签署这项声明的。
    新华社联合国４月７日电　民主柬埔寨驻联合国大使秀蒲拉西今天说，越南宣布从柬埔寨撤军是“有条件的”而不是像河内所说的那样是“无条件的”。
    新华社北京４月８日电　新加坡消息：新加坡外交部发言人７日说，越南宣布在今年９月底之前从柬埔寨全部撤军应该在联合国的有效监督下进行。
    这位发言人说，越南撤军不能由它自己提出条件。对越南撤军的客观认可是十分重要的。
    他说，新加坡同意西哈努克亲王的主张，越南不能单方面决定国际监督机构的组成和它的作用。
    他强调说，国际监督机构应该核查越南目前在柬埔寨的兵力和监督其撤军进程，以防止越南军队在伪装形式下继续留在柬埔寨。
    他说，只有在有效的国际监督下才能停止在柬埔寨的敌对行动，防止任何一派单独掌权，在柬埔寨组织公正的选举。
    这位发言人还重申了新加坡的主张，未来柬埔寨的政府应由民柬三方和金边政权组成。
