This is indeed a surprising phenomenon.

In the so-called land of fish and rice, Suzhou, some farmers who have traditionally made a living from farming and fishing in the suburban areas have suddenly started spending their entire days around the city's garbage dumps picking up trash. Once the garbage trucks arrive, people bring baskets and rakes, rushing forward in a swarm, picking and choosing, creating quite a lively scene.

What causes these farmers and fishermen to take up this line of work? Let's hear what they have to say: Living in a place like Suzhou, where industry and commerce are developed, farming and fishing are the least profitable occupations. Picking up trash for a day can earn each of us at least four or five yuan in cash; if lucky, and if one has sharp eyes and quick hands, one can pick up trash worth ten yuan from factory dumps. This is much better than farming and fishing, as it brings in some cash every day.

Facing this phenomenon and these thoughts, people should consider: Is the gain greater, or the loss?

### 得与失——辍耕捡破烂现象（图片）

    得与失
    ——辍耕捡破烂现象
    这确实是能令人惊诧的事。
    在号称鱼米之乡的苏州，一些素来以种田、养鱼为生的郊区农民，骤然间整天围着市郊一些垃圾堆捡破烂（上图）。垃圾车一到，只见人们携筐带耙，争先恐后，蜂拥而上，挑挑拣拣，好不热闹（下图）。
    是什么原因使这些务农、养鱼的人爱上这个行当呢？不妨听听这些人的议论：生活在像苏州这样工业、商业发达的城市郊区，种田、养鱼是最不合算的营生。捡破烂一天下来，我们每人至少也能换回四五元现钱；运气好，遇到工厂倒垃圾，眼尖手快的人，保管能捡回值10元大钞的“破烂”。这远比种田、养鱼强，天天都能有点现钱收益。
    面对这种现象和想法，人们该想一想，是得大，还是失大？
