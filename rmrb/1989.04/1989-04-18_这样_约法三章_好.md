Having power as an official means that people will come seeking favors. This is only natural. Therefore, the use of this power is quite an art. As officials of the people, they should use their power to do things that benefit the country and the people, which goes without saying. The problem is that it is not easy to truly practice this. Now, many officials treat the people's interests as a joke, arbitrarily using their power. When they encounter connections, they issue "notes," when they meet acquaintances, they open "back doors," and even use their power for personal gain, making "mutual convenience." This is very displeasing to the common people.

The leaders of Huaiyuan County publicly displayed over 500 "notes" for fertilizer issued through back doors, expressing their determination to eliminate the "note wind" of using power for personal gain. This determination is well-made.

From top to bottom, this has always been the case. If the county officials are not clean, how can the township and village officials not be influenced? The county committee secretary and county magistrate of Huaiyuan County took the lead in signing, along with the majority of cadres, to jointly agree on three points, and the "note wind" will not be difficult to stop. Furthermore, if those with more power than the county committee secretary and county magistrate also come to make such "three-point agreements," won't the unhealthy trends within the party definitely shrink their market!

　　这样“约法三章”好
    三保
    当官有权，有权就有人求。顺理成章。于是这权的利用便很有讲究。人民的官，有了权就要一心办些于国于民有利的事，自不待言。问题是，真要这样身体力行很不容易。现在不少做官的，视人民利益为儿戏，随意支配权力，遇上关系户批“条子”，碰上熟人开“后门”，甚至借权谋私，“两下方便”，很叫老百姓看不顺眼。怀远县领导当众把“走后门”批化肥的５００多张“条子”亮相，表达了杜绝以权谋私的“条子风”的决心，这决心下得好。
    上行下效，自古皆然。你县官不清廉，乡官、村官岂能不受影响？怀远县县委书记、县长带头签名，与广大干部共同约法三章，“条子风”便不愁刹不住。进而言之，比县委书记、县长更有权的同志，假如都来这样“约法三章”，党内不正之风不是肯定要大大缩小它的市场么！
