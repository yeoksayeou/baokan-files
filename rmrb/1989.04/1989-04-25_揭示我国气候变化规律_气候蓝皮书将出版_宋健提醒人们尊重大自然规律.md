Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 25th. Reporter Xie Lianhui reports: Just like the global situation, the development and progress of the Chinese nation are facing severe challenges from three major issues: population explosion, resource scarcity, and environmental degradation. Solving these three problems is all related to meteorological conditions. State Councilor and Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission Song Jian, at today's second plenary meeting (expanded) of the National Climate Committee, urged disciplines such as climatology, meteorology, and oceanography to contribute to the study and elucidation of the laws governing climate change in China and even the world.

Song Jian revealed that in recent years, under the leadership of the National Climate Committee, scientists from various related fields have made significant efforts and achieved a large number of results in the fields of ancient climate, historical climate, modern climate changes, and future climate development trends in China. These results are compiled in the "Climate Blue Book," which will be officially published after being reviewed and revised at this meeting. This is an important contribution of climate science to social development.

He said that the basic views and trends stated in the Blue Book are estimated to have a certain scientific basis and should not be ignored. They should be made known to more people, which will help people, especially those in decision-making positions, to make more correct judgments, reduce reckless actions, and eliminate erroneous and foolish behaviors that go against the laws of nature.

　　揭示我国气候变化规律    
    气候蓝皮书将出版     
    宋健提醒人们尊重大自然规律
    本报北京４月２５日讯  记者谢联辉报道：和全世界的形势一样，中华民族的发展和进步面临着人口膨胀、资源短缺和环境恶化三大问题的严重挑战。解决这三大问题，都与气象条件有关。国务委员、国家科委主任宋健在今天召开的国家气候委员会第二次全体委员（扩大）会议上，要求气候学、气象学、海洋学等许多学科为研究和阐明中国以至世界气候变化规律作贡献。
    宋健透露，最近几年，在国家气候委员会领导下，经过各有关专业的科学家们共同努力，在中国的古气候、历史气候、现代气候变迁，未来气候发展趋势等方面取得大批成果。这些成果汇集在“气候蓝皮书”中，将经过这次会议审议修订后正式出版发行。这是气候科学对社会发展的一个重要贡献。
    他说，蓝皮书中所陈述的基本观点和趋势估计是有一定科学根据的，不能忽视，应该让更多的人了解，这会帮助人们特别是处于决策地位的人们，做出比较正确的判断，减少“蛮干”，杜绝“与大自然规律对着干”那类错误和愚蠢行为。
