The Fishing Platform of Yan Ziling, located in the north bank of the Fuchun River in Fuchun Mountain, 18 kilometers west of the county seat of Tonglu County, Zhejiang Province, is famous because Yan Ziling once farmed and fished here during the Eastern Han Dynasty.

According to the "Book of the Later Han," Yan Ziling, whose courtesy name was Ziling, was from Yuyao, Willow County. He was renowned from a young age and had studied with Emperor Guangwu of the Han Dynasty, Liu Xiu. After Liu Xiu ascended the throne, Yan Ziling changed his name and hid himself, refusing to come out. Emperor Guangwu missed his talent and sent people to find him. Later, someone reported that a man wearing a sheepskin coat was fishing in the marshes. The emperor knew it was Yan Ziling and sent a carriage to invite him. After repeated invitations, Yan Ziling finally went to Luoyang to see the emperor. Emperor Guangwu asked him to help govern the country and personally appointed him as the Grand Counselor, but he declined and returned to Fuchun Mountain to live a life of farming and fishing. The Tang Dynasty poet Wang Zhenbo wrote in his poem "On the Fishing Platform of Yan Ziling":

    "Mountains are green in all four seasons,
    The stream's sound is clear for seven miles.
    Yan Ziling loves this scenery,
    Looking down on the Han Dynasty officials."

This poem describes how Yan Ziling loved the scenery of Fuchun Mountain so much that he regarded official positions and wealth as worthless, wishing only to "spend his life in this painted world," farming and fishing until the end of his days.

As early as the Tang Dynasty, people admired Yan Ziling's integrity and high moral character and built a temple in his honor. The temple has been rebuilt and destroyed many times since then. In recent years, the local government has raised funds to renovate the Fishing Platform of Yan Ziling. Inside the newly rebuilt temple of Mr. Yan, the newly sculpted statue of Yan Ziling is elegant and ancient, embodying the demeanor of a noble scholar. On both sides of the temple, steles, guest star pavilions, Qingfeng Xuan, the Nineteenth Spring of the World, and Gaofeng Pavilion have been restored and newly built, providing places for tourists to appreciate and rest.

The East Platform and the West Platform are the symbols and characteristics of the Fishing Platform of Yan Ziling. It is said that the West Platform is where the Song Dynasty scholar Xie Yi mourned and sacrificed to Wen Tianxiang, and the East Platform is where Yan Ziling lived in seclusion and fished. The two large stone platforms stand about 100 meters high, facing each other, overlooking the river, and are the essence of Fuchun Mountain and water. On the west side of the East Platform, there is a large stone platform where more than a hundred people can sit, hanging over the riverbank. Tourists who climb here to enjoy the scenery feel a sense of awe and excitement. After visiting, the famous Tang Dynasty poet Meng Haoran wrote a poem expressing his regret: "The fishing platform is flat and can be sat on, but it is a pity that I came late."

### 严子陵钓台

　　严子陵钓台
    柳雪权
    严子陵钓台，坐落在浙江省桐庐县城以西十八公里的富春江北岸富春山上。她因东汉时严光曾耕钓于此而闻名。
    据《后汉书》记载，严光，字子陵，会稽余姚人，少有高名，曾与光武帝刘秀同学。至光武即位乃变名姓，隐居不出。光武帝思其贤，令人寻访。后有人奏报，有一男子披羊裘钓泽中。帝知是严光，乃备车遣使，再三召请，严光才至洛阳见帝。光武帝请他相助治理国家，并当面授予谏议大夫的高官，他不接受，仍回富春山隐居，过着耕钓生涯。唐人王贞白《题严陵钓台》诗云：“山色四时碧，溪声七里清，严陵爱此景，下视汉公卿。”说严光因酷爱富春山水，所以视爵禄如敝屣，只愿“此身长住画图中”，耕田钓鱼，终老林泉。
    早在唐朝，人们仰慕严光的亮节高风，曾建有严陵祠。以后，祠宇屡经兴废。近些年，严子陵钓台由当地政府筹款，已修葺一新。在重建的严先生祠堂内，新塑的严光坐像清雅古朴，高士风度。在祠堂两侧还恢复和新建了碑廊、客星亭、清风轩、天下第十九泉、高风阁等，供游人观赏、小憩。
    东台和西台是严子陵钓台的标志和特色。相传西台为宋代处士谢翱哭祭文天祥处，东台为严子陵隐居垂钓处。两大石台高约百米，耸立对峙，俯瞰江流，为富春山水的精华所在。东台西侧有一巨石平台，可坐百余人，悬挂江岸。游人登此赏景，奇险、惊心的感觉油然而生。唐代著名诗人孟浩然游览后，曾赋诗感叹“钓矶平可坐，观其恨来晚。”
