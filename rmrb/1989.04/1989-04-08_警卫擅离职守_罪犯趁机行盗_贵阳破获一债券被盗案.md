Security Guard Abandons Post; Criminals Seize Opportunity to Steal
Guangxi Police Solve Major Bond Theft Case

On the morning of April 5 at 2:00 AM, the public security department of Guiyang City solved a major case of financial bond theft from a bank. The unemployed woman Zhou Linshui and the young worker Wang Lin were apprehended, and 18.68 million yuan in stolen financial bonds and 6,500 yuan in cash were seized.

On the afternoon of January 5 around 6:00 PM, the security personnel of the Guiyang City Industrial and Commercial Bank Guixi Branch office abandoned their post while receiving the cash packages from various savings offices back to the vault. As a result, a brown special-use briefcase containing 1.359 million yuan in cash, 18.68 million yuan in financial bonds, and 10 business seals was stolen.

This financial bond theft case attracted the attention of the State Council and relevant leaders of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. Guiyang City immediately formed a joint task force to investigate and solve the case, ultimately arresting the thieves Zhou Linshui and Wang Lin.
