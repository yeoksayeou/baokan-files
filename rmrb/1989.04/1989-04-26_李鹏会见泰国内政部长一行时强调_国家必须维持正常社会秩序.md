    Premier Li Peng today afternoon met with a delegation from Thailand in Zhongnanhai and emphasized that any country must maintain a "normal social order."

    Li Peng said: "No matter what kind of social system a country has, if it cannot maintain a normal social order, it will not only fail to develop but may not even be able to survive."

    He made these remarks during a meeting with General Bamrung Suphapong, Minister of the Interior of Thailand, and his wife. General Bamrung, at the invitation of Wang Fang, State Councilor and Minister of Public Security, came to China for a visit and arrived in Beijing yesterday.

    During the meeting, Li Peng said that the Interior Ministry of Thailand and the Public Security Bureau of China are very important departments. He praised the good cooperation between the two departments.

    Li Peng told the Thai guests: "China's political situation is stable, and the policy of reform and opening up will not change."

    The two sides also exchanged views on the Cambodian issue. Li Peng said that China and Thailand have cooperated well in supporting the Cambodian resistance forces against Vietnamese aggression. China hopes to continue this cooperation to the end.

    He said that the major issue facing the international community now is to urge Vietnam to withdraw all its troops from Cambodia by the end of September this year under international supervision and to establish a temporary joint government led by Prince Sihanouk. China will continue to work for this goal. Li Peng pointed out that the obstacles to national reconciliation in Cambodia are not from the three factions of the Khmer resistance but from Vietnam and the Heng Samrin-Hun Sen regime it supports.

    General Bamrung told Premier Li Peng that his morning talks with Wang Fang went very well. He said that Thailand and China have a traditional friendship, and the relations between the two countries have always been good.

　　李鹏会见泰国内政部长一行时强调    
    国家必须维持正常社会秩序
    新华社北京４月２６日电（记者周慈朴）国务院总理李鹏今天下午在中南海会见泰国客人时强调，任何国家必须维持一个“正常的社会秩序”。
    李鹏说：“任何一个国家，不管其社会制度如何，如果不能维持一个正常的社会秩序，不要说发展，就连生存也不可能。”
    他是在会见泰国内政部长巴曼上将和夫人一行时说这番话的。巴曼上将应国务委员兼公安部长王芳的邀请前来中国进行访问，于昨天抵达北京。
    会见时，李鹏说，泰国的内政部和中国的公安部是十分重要的部门。他称赞这两个部门合作得很好。
    李鹏对泰国客人说：“中国政局是稳定的，改革开放的政策不会变。”
    宾主还就柬埔寨问题交换了意见。李鹏说，中泰双方在支持柬埔寨抵抗力量反对越南侵略方面进行了很好的合作。中国希望把这一合作坚持到底。
    他说，现在国际社会面临的重大问题仍然是，要促使越南在今年９月底之前在国际监督下全部真正地从柬埔寨撤军，建立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府。中国将一如既往为此作出努力。李鹏指出，柬埔寨实现民族和解的阻力不是来自民柬三方，而是来自越南及其扶植的韩桑林—洪森政权。
    巴曼上将对李鹏总理说，今天上午，他同王芳的会谈进行得很好，泰中两国有着传统的友谊，两国关系一直很好。
