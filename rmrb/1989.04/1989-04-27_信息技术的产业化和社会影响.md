Information technology is developing into a fundamental factor in the economy. The transformation of information technology into productive forces relies on its industrialization.

Microelectronics, computers, fiber optics communication, sensors, software engineering, artificial intelligence, and other information technologies are developing into fundamental factors in the economy. The power they exhibit in promoting the development of productive forces is profound, not only for the current industrial economy but also for the future information economy, which is based on knowledge.

Information technology has strong penetrability, and its applications span all fields. It is rapidly changing the structure of social production and the appearance of people's lives. Information technology has significantly increased the service industry and has greatly enhanced the dependence of the manufacturing industry on the service industry. Following the third industry, the so-called "fourth industry" (based on intellectual labor) and "fifth industry" (based on emotional labor) have emerged. People's activities are more centered around the family than ever before. Information services are ubiquitous in society, like air and sunlight, they are indispensable elements for people.

The digitalization and globalization of information technology are trends. Digital technology has the advantages of clarity and speed. The Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is crucial for the future development of remote communication and information services. With the globalization of information technology, traditional national markets will be broken through, and a new global market structure will be nurtured. As markets become increasingly globalized, the connections of the global economy will change in ways beyond people's imagination.

Information technology becomes a real productive force through its industrialization. The information industry is an industry that serves other industries and is characterized by high technology and knowledge intensity.

The industrialization of information technology requires solving three problems: research and development, industrial development, and market formation. Research and development should not only stay at the prototype and sample stage but should achieve commercialization, promoting the application development of the medium and short term with the basic research of the medium and long term. Industrial development requires a combination of domestic and imported technologies to improve competitiveness and increase the rate of reproduction. Market formation includes both domestic and foreign markets, paying attention to changes in demand and purchasing power, and mastering the law of continuously decreasing prices of information technology products.

To develop the information industry, it is necessary to determine priority sectors, concentrate efforts, and make rapid progress. It is better to do a few things well. The determination of priority sectors is a dynamic rolling process, which should comprehensively consider technological foundations, social and economic benefits, market development prospects, and the impact on other sectors.

The scale of the information industry should be coordinated with non-information industries, and there should also be coordinated development within the information industry. It is necessary to balance consumer-oriented information technology products with investment-oriented information technology products. The market opportunities for the information industry are changing rapidly, and technological innovation in the information industry is active. It is important to timely adjust the structure of the information industry. To this end, efforts should be made to improve the compatibility of information technology products.

Information enterprises can be large or small, and the scale should be reasonable. Developing product series and application systems with competitive advantages, and establishing a closely linked group of enterprises in research, development, manufacturing, application, sales, training, and services, is an important issue in the development of the information industry.

Strengthening the industrialization of information technology services is an important part of the overall industrialization of information technology. The information industry should include the information technology service industry, and the information technology service industry will develop faster than the information technology product manufacturing industry.

Information technology and the information industry are areas of intense international competition. Economically developed countries are using the advanced information technology they have mastered to strengthen their economic and political positions in the world. Many developing countries are also striving to develop their own information technology and apply it to traditional industries to narrow the technological and economic gaps with developed countries.

Information technology and the information industry have both competitive and cooperative aspects between countries. This is similar to the international flow of information, where on the one hand, governments of various countries, to safeguard sovereignty and their own interests, restrict cross-border data transmission and take security and confidentiality measures; on the other hand, to promote economic and social development, they participate in and encourage such cross-border data transmission. The development of information technology and its industrialization worldwide is a process of advancing through the contradictions of competition and cooperation among different countries. Strengthening information technology cooperation among countries and regions will undoubtedly further promote mutual economic development and prosperity. As a developing socialist country, China should attach great importance to exploring and promoting information technology cooperation with other countries.

The development of information technology has a huge impact on almost all aspects of human activity. The more widespread the dissemination and application of information technology, the faster this impact will grow. How to benefit from the development of information technology is a question that every country must consider.

For developing countries, information and its transmission capabilities are more important than traditional infrastructure such as railways, electricity, and education. If land, labor, and capital are the basic resources of the industrial age, then information is the new basic resource of the information age. Effectively accessing information from information networks supported by information technology can accelerate economic growth, wealth creation, market expansion, and improved quality of life. Of the 67 million computers installed worldwide, developed countries account for 90%, while developing countries, which make up 70% of the world's population, own only 7% of the world's total telephone lines. Ensuring the smooth flow of information through advanced technologies such as remote communication and cross-border data transmission can help narrow the gaps between developing and developed countries in various aspects.

Information technology has a potential significant impact on education and training. Many countries are currently developing distance education to develop human resources, which is particularly suitable for geographically dispersed countries. China has a large population but low quality, and the development of national education is related to the fate of the country. Traditional school education cannot fully meet the needs of improving the population's quality, and the development of information technology will bring revolutionary changes to education and training. Distance education methods have been put on the agenda for developing countries to develop human resources, which is particularly important for countries with vast territories. From radio distance education to distance education based on computers and satellite communications, it will fundamentally change the scientific and cultural backwardness of rural areas. China should pay attention to the issue of developing distance education methods using information technology in continuing education and adult education.

Information technology is a bonding agent and catalyst that miraculously connects the global economy more closely, making information a new "currency" used worldwide. Information technology was once considered a "result" of economic development, but now more and more people realize that it is a "seed" of economic development. One reason why the U.S. economy is still so developed is that it has always been at the forefront of information technology. Of the 3,000 databases in the world, the U.S. accounts for more than half. 80% of the world's telephone or data transmissions either originate in the U.S. or terminate there. The process of industrialization in the "Four Asian Tigers" (Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan) is a process in which information technology plays a role. Developing countries should study the significant role of information technology in the development of new industrial economies to formulate their own development strategies.

The development of remote communication and information technology services is a need for the economic development of all countries. The infrastructure and various services of remote communication should be developed simultaneously. Transnational corporations play an important role in the development of remote communication networks and may become important partners for developing countries in the formation of the information technology industry. The development of information technology in various regions of the world shows a clear trend of liberalization. The privatization and decentralization of remote communication and its services are manifestations of this trend. It promotes the economic development and liberalization of economic systems in various regions of the world. Economic liberalization produces efficiency but also raises the issue of mutual dialogue among countries.

Information technology is the core of high technology. China attaches great importance to the research and development of information technology and the information industry and has formulated corresponding development policies, achieving certain results in practical work. However, in the development of information technology and its supporting and key areas, there is still room for further research and improvement.

　　信息技术的产业化和社会影响
    乌家培
    信息技术正在发展成为决定经济的基本因素。信息技术成为生产力，要依靠信息技术的产业化。
    微电子、计算机、光纤通信、传感器、软件工程、人工智能等信息技术，正在发展成为决定经济的基本因素。这些因素在促进生产力发展上显示出来的威力，不仅对当前的工业化经济，而且对今后的信息化经济，即以知识为基础的经济，都有深刻的影响。
    信息技术具有很强的渗透性，它的应用遍及各个领域。信息技术正在迅速改变社会生产的格局和人们生活的面貌。信息技术使服务业大幅度增长，并使制造业对服务业的依赖程度空前加强，继第三产业之后又分化出所谓“第四产业”（以脑力劳动为基础的产业）、“第五产业”（以情感性劳动为基础的产业），人们活动比以往任何时候都更加以家庭为中心。信息服务遍及社会的各个角落，它好像空气和阳光一样，是人们须臾不可缺少的要素。
    信息技术的数字化与全球化是发展的趋势。数字技术具有清晰、快速的优点。综合服务数字网络（ＩＳＤＮ）对未来远程通信和信息服务的发展至关重要。随着信息技术全球化的发展，将突破传统的国家市场，孕育出崭新的全球市场结构。由于市场变得越来越全球化，全球经济一体化的联系将以人们意想不到的方式日新月异地变化。
    信息技术成为现实的生产力，要依靠信息技术的产业化。信息产业是为产业服务的产业，有技术密集和知识密集的特点。
    信息技术产业化要求解决研究开发、产业发展、市场形成三个问题。研究开发不只是停留在样品、样机上，而应实现商品化，使中短期的应用开发与中长期的基础研究相互促进。产业发展要求国产与引进相结合，提高竞争力和增殖率。市场形成包括国内和国外，要注意需求变化和用户购买力，掌握信息技术产品的价格不断降低的规律。
    发展信息产业，首先要确定优先部门，集中力量，快速推进。要宁少务好。优先部门的确定，是一个动态的滚动过程，应综合考虑技术基础、社会经济效益、市场发展前景、对其它部门的影响等因素。
    信息产业的规模应与非信息产业相协调，信息产业内部也应当协调发展。要兼顾消费类信息技术产品与投资类信息技术产品。信息产业的市场机会多变，信息产业的技术创新活跃，及时调整信息产业结构甚为重要。为此，需要努力提高信息技术产品的兼容性。
    信息企业可大可小，规模要合理。发展有竞争优势的产品系列和应用系统，建立科研、开发、制造、应用、销售、培训、服务等紧密联系的企业群体，是发展信息产业不可忽视的问题。
    加强信息技术服务的产业化，是整个信息技术产业化的一个重要组成部分。信息产业应当包括信息技术服务业，信息技术服务业比信息技术产品制造会有更快的发展。
    信息技术和信息产业是国际竞争十分激烈的一个领域。经济发达国家正在利用已经掌握的先进的信息技术，来加强他们在世界上的经济和政治地位。好些发展中国家也在努力发展自己的信息技术，并应用于传统产业，以缩小他们与发达国家相比的技术差距和经济差距。
    信息技术与信息产业在国家与国家之间，既有竞争与保密的一面，又有合作与交流的一面。这与国际信息流动相类似，一方面各国政府为保障主权与自身利益，要对跨国数据传输进行限制和采取安全保密措施；另一方面为推进经济和社会的发展，又要参与和鼓励这种跨国数据传输。全世界的信息技术及其产业化，是在不同国家之间相互竞争又相互合作的矛盾过程中发展前进的。加强各个国家和地区之间的信息技术合作，必然会进一步促进相互间的经济发展和繁荣。我国是一个发展中的社会主义国家，应该十分重视探索和促进与其他国家的信息技术合作。
    信息技术的发展几乎对人类活动的一切方面都有巨大的影响。信息技术的传播与应用越广泛，这种影响就会以更快的速度增大。如何从信息技术的发展中受益，是每个国家必须考虑的问题。
    信息及其传输能力对发展中国家来说，比铁路、电力、教育等传统的基础设施更重要。如果说土地、劳动和资本是工业时代的基本资源，那么信息则是信息时代的新的基本资源。从信息技术支撑的信息网络中有效地存取信息，能加速经济增长、财富创造、市场扩大、生活质量提高。全世界安装的６７００万台计算机，发达国家就占了９０％，而占世界人口７０％的发展中国家只拥有世界电话总数的７％。通过远程通信、跨国数据传输等先进技术来保证信息流的畅通，有助于缩短发展中国家与发达国家间各方面的差距。
    信息技术对教育、培训具有潜在的重大作用。目前许多国家正发展远程教学以开发人力资源，这对地理上分散的国家尤为适用。我国人口多但素质不高，国民教育的发展关系到国家的命运，传统的学校教育不可能完全满足提高人口素质的需要，而信息技术的发展将给教育与培训带来革命性的变化。远程教学方式已提到发展中国家开发人力资源的日程上，这对国土辽阔的国家尤为重要。从无线电收音机的远程教学到以计算机与卫星通信为基础的远程教学，将使农村科学和文化落后的状态根本改观。我国应重视在继续教育与成人教育中利用信息技术发展远程教学方式的问题。
    信息技术是一种粘合剂与催化剂，它神奇般地将全球经济更紧密地连接在一起，从而使信息成为世界通用的新“通货”。信息技术曾经被认为是经济发展的“结果”，而现在越来越多的人明白，它是经济发展的“种子”。美国经济为什么还这样发达，原因之一是它始终在信息技术方面占居领先地位。世界上有３０００个数据库，美国就占了一半以上。全世界８０％的电话或数据传输，不是起始于美国就是终止于美国。亚洲“四小”（新加坡、南朝鲜、香港、台湾）工业化经济的发展过程，就是信息技术起作用的过程。发展中国家应研究信息技术在新兴工业化经济发展中的重大作用，以制定自己的发展战略。
    发展远程通信和信息技术服务是各国经济发展的需要，远程通信的基础设施与各种服务要同时发展。跨国公司在远程通信网络的发展中有重要作用，它可能成为发展中国家形成信息技术产业的重要伙伴。世界各个地区信息技术的发展，出现了明显的自由化趋势，远程通信及其服务的私人化与分散化是这种趋势的表现。它促进了世界各个地区的经济发展与经济制度的自由化。经济自由化产生了效率，但也提出了各国间相互对话的问题。
    信息技术是高技术的核心。我国十分重视信息技术和信息产业的研究与开发，已制订出相应的发展政策，并在实际工作中取得了一定的成绩。但在发展信息技术的配套和重点上，还有待进一步研究和改进。
