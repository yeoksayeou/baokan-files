Yu Feiyan, a renowned Beijing painter of meticulous flower-and-bird paintings, would have been 100 years old this year. To commemorate this pioneer of the meticulous double-outline heavy-color painting style, the Beijing Academy of Fine Arts and the Palace Museum recently jointly held an exhibition of "Yu Feiyan's Posthumous Works" at the Palace Museum's painting exhibition hall.

Yu Feiyan was a highly educated and versatile artist, not only a painter but also a calligrapher, seal carver, writer, and art educator. Interestingly, he was also an enthusiast. He enjoyed flowers, birds, pigeons, and more. Naturally, his interests were not purely recreational but were for the sake of sketching and creating art. In his time, Yu Feiyan supported a large family, with elderly parents and young children, all relying on him for sustenance. To make a living, he taught at various institutions such as the "Beiping Art Academy," "Beiping Normal School," "Huabei University Art Department," and "Jinghua Art College" during the day, and worked as an editor at the Beiping Morning Post in the evenings. In his spare time, he sold his writings, calligraphy, seals, and paintings. This arduous life led to his comprehensive development in the arts.

In his youth, Yu Feiyan studied meticulous grass insect painting from folk artist Wang Runxuan and learned about pigment preparation. In his middle years, he turned to painting landscapes and the freehand flower-and-bird style of Chen Baiyang from the Ming Dynasty. In the 1930s, the Beijing flower-and-bird painting scene was dominated by freehand and boneless styles, with many renowned artists. Yu Feiyan, who was part of this group, was almost overshadowed. Later, with the guidance of his old friend Zhang Daqian, he decided to change his approach, forging a new path by abandoning small freehand styles and adopting the meticulous double-outline heavy-color technique. He started with Chen Hongshou, traced back to the Five Dynasties and Song Dynasty, and even studied the works of Zhao Ji and Zhao Ji.

Yu Feiyan truly began his study of meticulous flower-and-bird painting in 1935, at the age of 46. From the 1930s until the mid-1950s, he gained fame and established his own school in the Beijing art scene.

The mid-to-late 1950s was the mature period of Yu Feiyan's meticulous flower-and-bird paintings. His works from this period represent the pinnacle of Beijing's meticulous flower-and-bird paintings of the 1950s and 1960s. Notable works include "Auspicious Clouds and Flock of Pigeons," "Magnolia and Yellow Oriole," "Long Live Peace," and "Red Plum and Mountain Partridge." Particularly, his final masterpiece, "Four Seasons of Peony," captures the essence of peonies in all four seasons: the flowers of spring, the leaves of summer, and the old stems of autumn. Yu Feiyan's meticulous flower-and-bird paintings emphasize both form and spirit, with a refined taste. In composition, he did not adhere to old conventions but drew inspiration from sister arts, creating fresh and serene scenes. In brushwork, he balanced strength and softness, paying attention to momentum. In color usage, he achieved vibrancy without vulgarity, subtlety without dullness. In the history of modern Chinese painting, Yu Feiyan's style holds an important position.

　　于非闇和他的画
    包立民
    今年是北京工笔花鸟画家于非闇先生的百年诞辰，为了纪念北京画坛上的这位工笔双勾重彩画派的继往开来者，北京画院、故宫博物院最近在故宫绘画陈列室，联合举办了“于非闇遗作展”。
    于非闇是一位知识渊博、文艺修养比较全面的“写家”，不仅是一位画家，而且是一个书家、印家、作家，是一个艺术教育家。更有趣的是他还是一个玩家。他能玩花、玩鸟、玩鸽子，玩……自然，他的玩不是纯粹的玩，而是为了写生和创作。当年的于非闇，家庭人口众多，上有老、下有小，全靠他一人养家糊口，为了谋生，他白天先后到“北平艺专”、“北平师范学校”、“华北大学艺术系”、“京华美专”等院校兼课，晚上到北平《晨报》当编辑，业余时间鬻文、鬻书、鬻印、鬻画，艰苦的生活，促成了于非闇在艺术上的全面发展。
    于非闇在少年时代向民间画家王润轩学过工笔草虫，学过研制颜料；中青年时代转学画山水和明代陈白阳的写意花卉点缀草虫。三十年代的北京花鸟画坛上，写意和没骨法居多，名家也较多，跻身于写意、没骨法花鸟画家行列中，于非闇几乎被淹没了。后来经老友张大千的点拨，他才下决心改弦易辙，另辟蹊径，弃小写意，改工笔双勾重彩，从陈老莲入手，上溯五代两宋，直追赵子固、赵佶；从继承传统工笔双勾重彩和宋刻艺术中寻找新路。
    于非闇真正开始学习工笔花鸟画是在１９３５年，时年４６岁。从三十年代始，直到五十年代中期才成名成家，在北京画坛上自成一派。
    五十年代中后期，是于非闇工笔花鸟画的成熟期，而于非闇这段时期的作品，也代表了五六十年代北京工笔花鸟的高峰。其代表作品有《祥云群鸽》、《玉兰黄鹂》、《和平万岁》、《红杏山鹧》……尤其是生前创作的绝笔《四季牡丹图》，将牡丹在四季的精华：春天之花，伏天之叶，秋后之老干集于一身。于非闇的工笔花鸟讲究形神兼备，格调高雅。在构图上，不墨守陈规，能汲收姐妹艺术的营养，意境清新；在用笔上，刚柔相济，注意气势，在用色上，艳而不俗，淡而不薄不灰。在中国现代画史上，于派艺术具有重要的地位。
