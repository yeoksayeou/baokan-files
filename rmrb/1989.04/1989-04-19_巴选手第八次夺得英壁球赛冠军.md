In the fourth set, he was completely dominated by his opponent (0:9), but he managed to pull through in the decisive set, ending the match with a score of 9:2. After the match, he said that the referee's decisions surprised him a few times, but he was not affected by them and instead played faster and more aggressively. He admitted that this year's competition was more challenging, with every player performing well, and he felt a lot of pressure.

The women's singles champion was New Zealand's Susan Devoy. She defeated Britain's Moyna 3:1 to successfully defend her title.

　　巴选手第八次夺得英壁球赛冠军
    新华社伦敦４月１７日电　（记者张明德）世界冠军贾·汉今天在这里经受住了澳大利亚选手马丁的挑战，第八次获得英国壁球公开赛男子单打冠军。
    这位闻名世界的巴基斯坦球星取得的这一新成绩，平了澳大利亚选手亨特在英国壁球公开赛男单比赛中的夺魁纪录。
    贾·汉今天苦战５局才获胜，第四局竟被对手剃了个光头（０∶９），好在决胜局打得不错，以９∶２结束了比赛。他赛后说，裁判有几次判决使他感到意外，但他没有因此受影响，而是打得更快、进攻更猛烈了。他承认，今年的比赛对他来说难度加大，每个选手打得都不错，他感到有许多压力。
    获得女子单打冠军的是新西兰的德沃伊。她以３∶１战胜英国的莫伊娜，卫冕成功。
