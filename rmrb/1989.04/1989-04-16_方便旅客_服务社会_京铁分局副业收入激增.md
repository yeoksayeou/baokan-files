Passengers do not need to leave Beijing Station to buy Beijing's local specialties; consignors within the jurisdiction do not need to come to the station to consign goods. The Beijing Railway Bureau, which operates multiple businesses and provides integrated services, has now established 452 service outlets, which have been convenient for the public and have also opened up new sources of income. Last year, the bureau's auxiliary income reached 169 million yuan, and in the first quarter of this year, it has increased significantly compared to the same period last year.

Providing convenience for passengers is the starting point for the bureau's development of multiple businesses. Currently, major passenger stations such as Beijing Station, Beijing South Station, and Beijing North Station have set up 13 sales service outlets, with an annual sales volume of nearly 53.87 million yuan.

Packaging and consignment, pickup and delivery extension services are important projects for the bureau's auxiliary production. In 1987, Beijing Station established the Red Hat Small Item Moving Team, which annually moves luggage for more than 200,000 domestic and foreign passengers, plugging the loophole of illegal moving of items and overcharging.

　　方便旅客　服务社会
　　京铁分局副业收入激增
    本报讯　旅客不出北京站，就能买到北京的土特产；所辖范围内货主不用到车站，就能托运货物。开展多种经营、实行一体服务的北京铁路分局，目前已开办四百五十二个服务网点，方便了群众，也开辟了新的财源。去年全分局副业收入达一点六九亿元，今年第一季度比去年同期又有较大幅度增长。
    为旅客提供方便，是这个分局开办多种经营的出发点。现在，北京站、北京南站、北京北站等几个主要客运站，已设立十三个售货服务网点，年销售额近五千三百八十七万元。
    包装托运、接取送达延伸服务，是这个分局副业生产的重要项目。一九八七年北京站成立了红帽子小件搬运队，每年为国内外旅客搬运行李二十多万件，堵塞了不法分子搬运物品乱要价的漏洞。
