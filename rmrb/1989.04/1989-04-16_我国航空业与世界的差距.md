Over the past 30 years, the transportation structures of various countries around the world have undergone significant changes. From 1950 to 1980, the share of air passenger traffic in the United States increased from 2% to 13%, while in the Soviet Union, it rose from 1.2% to 18%. In contrast, the share of rail passenger traffic in the United States decreased from 16% in 1929 to 0.7% in 1980, and in the Soviet Union, it fell from 89% in 1950 to 37% in 1980. In China, the share of rail passenger traffic was roughly equal to that of the Soviet Union in 1950, but by 1980, it remained at 60.7%, while the share of air passenger traffic was only 1.3%.

China's air passenger traffic lags significantly behind the world average and even behind that of developing countries. China's population accounts for 22.6% of the world's total, its land area is approximately 6.4% of the world's total, and its GDP in 1980 was about 2.4% of the world's total. However, China's civil aviation passenger traffic accounts for only 1/190 of the world's total, and the number of aircraft in its civil aviation fleet is about 1/100 of the world's total, with the number of passenger seats being about 1/130.

In the early 1980s, the average distance traveled by air per person per year worldwide was 227 kilometers. In 1981, the average distance traveled by air per person in China was 5 kilometers, which is 1/44 of the world average. Therefore, American aviation experts have said, "China is the world's last and largest untapped aviation market."

　　我国航空业与世界的差距
    ３０年来，世界各国交通运输结构发生很大变化。１９５０—１９８０年，美国航空旅客周转量所占比重由２％增至１３％；苏联由１．２％增至１８％。而铁路旅客周转量的比重，美国由１９２９年的１６％降至１９８０年的０．７％；苏联由１９５０年的８９％降至１９８０年的３７％。我国铁路旅客周转量所占比重，１９５０年与苏联基本相等，但至１９８０年仍维持在６０．７％，而航空旅客周转量比重只达１．３％。
    我国航空客运量与世界平均水平，甚至与发展中国家的水平相比，都有很大的差距。我国人口占世界人口的２２．６％，陆地面积约占世界的６．４％，国民生产总值１９８０年约占２．４％，而民航客运周转量仅占世界的１／１９０，民航机队飞机架数约占世界的１／１００，客座座位数约占１／１３０。
    八十年代初，世界每人每年乘坐民航的平均里程为２２７公里，而我国１９８１年人均航空客运里程为５公里，为世界人均里程的１／４４。因此，美国航空界人士曾说过：“中国是世界上最后的一个最大的航空市场。”
