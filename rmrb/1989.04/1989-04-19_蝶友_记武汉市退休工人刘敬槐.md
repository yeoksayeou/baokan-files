Before and after the Spring Festival, the butterfly exhibition at Wuhan's Turtle Mountain attracted numerous tourists. The butterfly specimens were lifelike, and the butterfly paintings were vibrant and enchanting. The exhibition was organized by retired worker Liu Jingkai.

Friends call him a butterfly enthusiast; Liu Jingkai calls himself a butterfly friend.

In the summer of 1981, he was reading "Reference News" as usual when a piece of news from "Asahi Shimbun" caught his eye.

The report said that a Japanese mountaineering team from Hokkaido had failed in their attempt to climb Mount Gongga in Sichuan, resulting in the deaths of eight people. However, they had made a "significant discovery": they had captured several Yunnan striped swallowtails. The newspaper then introduced that this was the oldest species of butterfly in the world. Half a century ago, a British person had captured one in Yunnan, which is still preserved in the British Museum.

Liu Jingkai felt as if he had been humiliated. Our country's precious butterfly resources had not been developed or even discovered by ourselves. In half a century, they had been discovered twice by foreigners, who treasured them as rare gems. As a Chinese citizen, didn't he have a responsibility?

Liu Jingkai then became obsessed with studying butterflies. He sought advice from experts, learned from professionals, and discovered that China is rich in butterflies, with over 1,300 of the world's 14,000 species found here. With his monthly retirement income of over 70 yuan, he funded his own research on China's butterfly resources and collected butterfly specimens. Year after year, he traveled through the western part of Hubei's Shennongjia, Yunnan's Cangshan, Sichuan's Daxiangling Mountains, and the Yao villages of Guangxi, enduring hardships and enjoying the beauty of nature.

Every time he captured a rare butterfly, he would rejoice like a child. Over the years, he captured tens of thousands of butterflies, with over 300 different species. Golden-winged swallowtails, jewel-winged swallowtails, skippers, three-tailed skippers, and golden-striped swallowtails all became his specimens. He also had many unique experiences, such as discovering the golden-striped swallowtail for the first time in the Daxiangling Mountains and capturing the Chinese tiger swallowtail for the first time in the suburbs of Wuhan.

Butterfly specimens filled his ten-square-meter room layer by layer. After making the specimens, he had a large number of colorful butterfly wings left over. He had a sudden idea to use the wings to paint. His deep foundation in painting techniques came in handy. After cutting, piecing together, and pasting the incomplete butterfly wings, they became vibrant butterfly paintings: migrating geese in autumn, drinking wine on an island, hiding behind a pipa, and dancing lightly, all of which were dazzling.

Liu Jingkai's pursuit has no end. Over the years, he has written dozens of articles on butterfly catching experiences and research on butterflies and butterfly paintings. His wish is to co-author "A Comprehensive Guide to Chinese Butterflies" with friends from Taiwan, filling a gap in China's butterfly research.

　　蝶友
　　——记武汉市退休工人刘敬槐
    本报记者　龚达发
    春节前后，武汉龟山的蝴蝶画展吸引了众多的游客。蝴蝶标本栩栩如生，蝶画流光溢彩，妩媚动人。展览是由退休工人刘敬槐主办的。
    朋友称他为蝶痴、蝶迷；刘敬槐自称蝶友。
    １９８１年夏天，他像往常一样捧读《参考消息》，一条《朝日新闻》的电讯跳入眼帘。
    报道说，日本北海道登山队在中国四川贡嘎山登山受挫，八人牺牲，但却有“重大收获”：捕到几只云南斑纹凤蝶。报纸接着介绍，这是世界上最古老的蝶种。半个世纪前英国人曾在云南捕过一只，至今还珍藏在大英博物馆。
    刘敬槐好像受到了羞辱。我们国家的珍贵蝴蝶资源，自己没有开发，甚至没有发现，在半个世纪之内被外国人两次发现，视为珍宝，作为一个中国公民难道没有责任吗？
    刘敬槐从此如痴如醉地钻研蝴蝶。他向专家求教，向内行学习，知道中国盛产蝴蝶，全世界１．４万种蝴蝶，中国就有１３００多种。他拿着每月７０多元的退休金，自费调查我国的蝴蝶资源，采集蝴蝶标本。年复一年，他走遍了鄂西神农架、云南苍山、川西大凉山、广西瑶寨，餐风饮露，青山作伴。
    每当他捕到一只珍贵蝴蝶，就像小孩一样欢呼雀跃。几年间捕到的蝴蝶数以万计，品种达３００多种。金裳凤蝶，宝镜凤蝶，扑喙蝶，三尾蛱蝶，金斑喙凤蝶等等都成了他的标本。他还有不少奇缘，在大凉山第一次发现金斑喙凤蝶，在武汉郊区第一次捕到中华虎凤蝶。
    蝴蝶标本层层叠叠地塞满了十几平方米的斗室。做标本剩下大量五光十色的蝴蝶残翅。他顿生奇想，用蝶翅作画。他功底很深的绘画技巧派上了用场。一片片残缺不全的蝶翅经过剪裁、拼凑、粘贴，就成了绚丽多彩的蝶画：秋雁排空，岛中对酒，琵琶遮面，轻歌曼舞，无不光彩夺目。
    刘敬槐的追求没有止境。几年来，他写了几十篇捕蝶心得和蝴蝶、蝶画研究文章。与台湾朋友共同编写《中华蝴蝶图鉴》，填补我国蝴蝶研究中的这项空白，是他的心愿。
