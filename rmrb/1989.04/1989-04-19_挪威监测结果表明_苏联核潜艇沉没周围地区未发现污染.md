The Norwegian government research institute today announced that monitoring results around the area where the Soviet nuclear submarine sank indicate no signs of nuclear contamination.

A Soviet nuclear submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April 8th. Norway established a special committee and dispatched experts and reconnaissance aircraft to monitor potential nuclear contamination. The Norwegian government research institute announced that Norwegian scientists monitored the seawater in the area where the submarine sank and found no abnormal increases in nuclear radiation.

To alleviate Norwegian citizens' fears of potential contamination from the Soviet nuclear submarine, the Norwegian government also released the conclusion of a 1986 secret research report from the Norwegian Defense Research Institute. The report stated that if a nuclear submarine were to sink near the Norwegian coast, the possibility of nuclear leakage is almost non-existent due to the protective layers of the nuclear reactor.

According to reports, in the days following the accident, Japan was concerned about potential nuclear contamination in the Norwegian Sea and significantly reduced its imports of salmon from Norway. After Norwegian officials assured Japan that no signs of nuclear contamination were found, Japan's import volume returned to normal.

According to local newspaper reports, after the accident, the Soviet Union had expressed that it would not rule out the possibility of salvaging the submarine. Recently, the Soviet Union informed Norway that, based on current technology, it is not possible to salvage the submarine.

### 挪威监测结果表明　苏联核潜艇沉没周围地区未发现污染

　　挪威监测结果表明
　　苏联核潜艇沉没周围地区未发现污染
    本报斯德哥尔摩４月１８日电　记者顾耀铭报道：据挪威国家政府研究所今天公布的消息，挪威对苏联沉没核潜艇周围地区监测结果表明，未发现有核污染现象。
    苏联一艘核潜艇４月８日在挪威海沉没后，挪威成立了特别委员会，派出专家和侦察机对可能发生的核污染进行监测。挪威国家政府研究所宣布，挪威科学家监测了核潜艇沉没地区的海水，未发现有核辐射增加的异常现象。
    为了平息挪威公民对苏联核潜艇可能造成污染的恐惧，挪威政府还公布了挪威国防部研究所１９８６年的一份秘密科研报告的结论部分，说明如果核潜艇在靠近挪海岸的海上沉没，由于受核反应堆防护层的阻挡，核泄漏的可能几乎没有。
    据报道，事故发生后的头几天，日本方面担心挪威海有可能出现核污染，大量减少了从挪威进口的沙门鱼量。挪威官方向日本方面保证未发现有任何核污染迹象后，日本的进口量已恢复正常。
    据这里的报纸报道，在事故发生后，苏联曾表示不排除打捞这艘潜艇的可能。最近苏联已向挪威表示，根据目前已掌握的技术，无法将这艘潜艇打捞上来。
