Jordan's King Hussein today accepted the resignation of the cabinet led by Rifai, and is preparing to appoint a new government to address the recent unrest in the southern region and the acute economic issues.

Since last Tuesday, the southern region of Ma'an in Jordan has seen unrest due to a 15% to 50% increase in the prices of basic necessities and food. Clashes between the military police and civilians have resulted in eight deaths and numerous injuries and arrests.

The situation in the south is now stabilizing. It is reported that the new cabinet may be formed within 48 hours.

    本报开罗４月２４日电  记者林皎明报道：约旦国王侯赛因今天接受以里法依为首的内阁辞呈，筹备任命新政府，以便妥善解决约旦近来的南部骚乱及尖锐的经济问题。
    上星期二以来，约旦南部马安地区由于基本生活用品、食品涨价１５％至５０％爆发骚乱。军警与民众发生冲突，８人死亡，多人受伤被捕。
