Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 25th.

In the activities mourning the passing of Comrade Hu Yaobang, the vast majority of Communist Party members, workers, peasants, intellectuals, cadres, the People's Liberation Army, and young students have expressed their grief in various ways and vowed to turn their sorrow into strength, contributing to the Four Modernizations and the revitalization of China.

During the mourning activities, however, some abnormal situations arose. A tiny number of people took the opportunity to spread rumors, attacking Party and state leaders by name; inciting the masses to storm the Zhongnanhai, the location of the Party Central Committee and the State Council; and even shouting reactionary slogans like "overthrow the Communist Party." In Xi'an and Changsha, some lawless elements carried out serious acts of beating, smashing, looting, and burning.

Considering the broad masses' grief, the Party and government adopted a tolerant and restrained attitude towards the inappropriate words and actions of some emotionally agitated young students. Before the memorial service for Comrade Hu Yaobang on April 22nd, the students who had arrived at Tiananmen Square earlier were not cleared out as usual, but were instead asked to maintain discipline and jointly mourn Hu Yaobang. Thanks to everyone's efforts, the memorial service was successfully held in a solemn and dignified atmosphere.

However, after the memorial service, a tiny number of people with ulterior motives continued to exploit the students' grief over Hu Yaobang, spreading various rumors, misleading people, and using big and small-character posters to slander, insult, and attack Party and state leaders. They openly violated the constitution, inciting opposition to the Communist Party's leadership and the socialist system. In some universities, illegal organizations were established, and attempts were made to seize power from the student unions. Some even occupied the school's broadcasting station. In some universities, students were incited to boycott classes and teachers to boycott teaching, and some even forcibly prevented classmates from attending classes. Workers' organizations were falsely used to distribute reactionary leaflets. They also coordinated efforts across the country, attempting to create greater disturbances.

These facts show that a tiny number of people are not engaged in mourning Hu Yaobang, nor are they pushing for socialist democratic politics in China. They are not merely venting some grievances. Under the guise of democracy, they are undermining democratic legality. Their goal is to sow discord, create chaos nationwide, and disrupt the stable and united political situation. This is a planned conspiracy, a turmoil, whose essence is to fundamentally deny the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system. This is a serious political struggle facing the entire Party and the people of all ethnic groups in the country.

If this turmoil is tolerated and allowed to continue, serious chaos will ensue. The hopes of the entire nation, including the broad masses of young students, for reform and opening up, rectification and development, controlling prices, improving living standards, combating corruption, and building democracy and the rule of law, will all be in vain. Even the tremendous achievements of the past decade of reform could be lost, and the great national aspiration to revitalize China would be difficult to realize. A China full of hope and promise would turn into a chaotic and hopeless China.

The entire Party and the people of the country must fully recognize the seriousness of this struggle, unite, and clearly oppose the turmoil. We must resolutely safeguard the hard-won stable and united political situation, uphold the constitution, and uphold socialist democracy and the rule of law. We must not allow any illegal organizations to form. Any actions that infringe on the legitimate rights of student organizations under any pretext must be firmly stopped. Those who maliciously spread rumors and slander must be held criminally liable. Illegal parades and demonstrations must be prohibited, as well as coordination efforts in factories, rural areas, and schools. Those who engage in beating, smashing, looting, and burning must be punished by law. We must protect students' legitimate right to study. The broad student body sincerely hopes to eliminate corruption and promote democracy, which is also the demand of the Party and the government. These demands can only be realized under the leadership of the Party, by strengthening rectification and development, actively promoting reform, and improving socialist democracy and the rule of law.

All Party members, the people of the entire country must clearly recognize that if this turmoil is not resolutely stopped, the country will have no peace. This struggle concerns the success or failure of reform and opening up and the Four Modernizations, and the future of the state and the nation. The Communist Party of China at all levels, the vast number of Communist Party members, Young Pioneers, democratic parties, patriotic democrats, and the people of the entire country must distinguish right from wrong, take action, and fight to resolutely and swiftly stop this turmoil!

### 必须旗帜鲜明地反对动乱

　　必须旗帜鲜明地反对动乱
    在悼念胡耀邦同志逝世的活动中，广大共产党员、工人、农民、知识分子、干部、解放军和青年学生，以各种形式表达自己的哀思，并表示要化悲痛为力量，为实现四化、振兴中华贡献力量。
    在悼念活动期间，也出现了一些不正常情况。极少数人借机制造谣言，指名攻击党和国家领导人；蛊惑群众冲击党中央、国务院所在地中南海新华门；甚至还有人喊出了打倒共产党等反动口号；在西安、长沙发生了一些不法分子打、砸、抢、烧的严重事件。
    考虑到广大群众的悲痛心情，对于青年学生感情激动时某些不妥当的言行，党和政府采取了容忍和克制态度。在２２日胡耀邦同志追悼大会召开前，对于先期到达天安门广场的一些学生并没有按照惯例清场，而是要求他们遵守纪律，共同追悼胡耀邦同志。由于大家的共同努力，保证了追悼大会在庄严肃穆的气氛中顺利进行。
    但是，在追悼大会后，极少数别有用心的人继续利用青年学生悼念胡耀邦同志的心情，制造种种谣言，蛊惑人心，利用大小字报污蔑、谩骂、攻击党和国家领导人；公然违反宪法，鼓动反对共产党的领导和社会主义制度；在一部分高等学校中成立非法组织，向学生会“夺权”，有的甚至抢占学校广播室；在有的高等学校中鼓动学生罢课、教师罢教，甚至强行阻止同学上课；盗用工人组织的名义，散发反动传单；并且四处串联，企图制造更大的事端。
    这些事实表明，极少数人不是在进行悼念胡耀邦同志的活动，不是为了在中国推进社会主义民主政治的进程，也不是有些不满发发牢骚。他们打着民主的旗号破坏民主法制，其目的是要搞散人心，搞乱全国，破坏安定团结的政治局面。这是一场有计划的阴谋，是一次动乱，其实质是要从根本上否定中国共产党的领导，否定社会主义制度。这是摆在全党和全国各族人民面前的一场严重的政治斗争。
    如果对这场动乱姑息纵容，听之任之，将会出现严重的混乱局面，全国人民，包括广大青年学生所希望的改革开放，治理整顿，建设发展，控制物价，改善生活，反对腐败现象，建设民主与法制，都将化为泡影；甚至十年改革取得的巨大成果都可能丧失殆尽，全民族振兴中华的宏伟愿望也难以实现。一个很有希望很有前途的中国，将变为一个动乱不安的没有前途的中国。
    全党和全国人民都要充分认识这场斗争的严重性，团结起来，旗帜鲜明地反对动乱，坚决维护得来不易的安定团结的政治局面，维护宪法，维护社会主义民主和法制。决不允许成立任何非法组织；对以任何借口侵犯合法学生组织权益的行为要坚决制止；对蓄意造谣进行诬陷者，要依法追究刑事责任；禁止非法游行示威，禁止到工厂、农村、学校进行串联；对于搞打、砸、抢、烧的人要依法制裁；要保护学生上课学习的正当权利。广大同学真诚地希望消除腐败，推进民主，这也是党和政府的要求，这些要求只能在党的领导下，加强治理整顿，积极推进改革，健全社会主义民主和法制来实现。
    全党同志、全国人民必须清醒地认识到，不坚决地制止这场动乱，将国无宁日。这场斗争事关改革开放和四化建设的成败，事关国家民族的前途。中国共产党各级组织、广大共产党员、共青团员、各民主党派、爱国民主人士和全国人民要明辨是非，积极行动起来，为坚决、迅速地制止这场动乱而斗争！
