Since dogmatism lost its dominant position in the domestic academic circles, the division of scholarly pursuits has led to intense debates. Ten years have passed, and from economics to literary criticism, the younger generation has risen, claiming that the scholars of the "truth criteria debate" era have completed their respectable historical mission and are not shy about "taking over" the academic stage. Naturally, there are also young scholars challenging the originators of the "accumulation theory" and "subjective practice philosophy," causing a sensation but ultimately finding that the position of this "aesthetic deity" is not so easily shaken. This "deity" is Li Zehou, a 58-year-old researcher at the Institute of Philosophy, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

As early as the 1950s, Li Zehou, a top student in the Department of Philosophy at Peking University, showed a rebellious tendency towards the "acceptance model" in his studies on the thoughts of Kang Youwei and Tan Sitong. Three years ago, he conducted a solo in-depth re-examination of Chinese thought and literary history since the May Fourth Movement, winning over countless students with a dual variation of enlightenment and salvation. His works were displayed on street bookstalls, with vendors shouting, "Li Zehou, Toffler, Freud..." in a grand display, although old-school scholars might shake their heads.

However, his "Chinese Ancient Thought History" disappointed some young people. Focusing on "exploring something for the future of all humanity and the world," he highly valued the nation's ethical and aesthetic heritage, but was suspected of being a fellow traveler of "New Confucianism," "betraying himself." He had to solemnly write to clarify his stance and distance himself from the "New Confucians."

"My disagreements with young friends revolve around two issues: one is about irrationality, and the other is about completely rejecting tradition," Li Zehou said. A doctoral student, with a "strong impulse of sensory life," engaged in a dialogue with Li Zehou in a best-selling book, criticizing Li Zehou for "lacking the 'doubt everything' critical perspective and the rebellious spirit of completely breaking away from traditional concepts," reflecting the "personality weakness of Chinese intellectuals." Li Zehou delayed his response, explaining that he found only "an emotional outburst" in such criticisms, without a "real theoretical challenge." "The author vented the young people's dissatisfaction, anger, and frustration, wanting to destroy everything. I highly respect this emotion of young people, but why use theory to confront or resolve this legitimate emotion?"

But he couldn't help but add, "Currently, there is a phenomenon among young people of completely rejecting tradition, which is somewhat similar to the Red Guards. The Red Guards were so fervent in 'smashing the Four Olds' and rejecting tradition, believing that to create a new culture, the old culture must be completely eradicated. This intense, irrational emotional response has a strong momentum and great motivational power, but it cannot solve any problems and may be a destructive force. China needs construction, not destruction. Previously, everyone talked about 'breaking first and establishing later,' but nothing substantial was actually established. It's easy to just criticize, but constructive academic work is not that simple. What China lacks is constructive rationality, not irrationality."

As a scholar, Li Zehou said he doesn't like many emotionally charged words, deeming them "unscientific language," and doesn't approve of the attitude of "only I am right, and everyone else is wrong." He hopes to promote a bit of Karl Popper's spirit of "you may be right, I may be wrong, let's work together to approach the truth." "What China needs most now is to establish this kind of modern, tolerant, and pluralistic attitude."

In recent years, Li Zehou has been advocating for pluralism and opposing the idea of a single dominant thought or culture. He firmly advocates for rationality but also introduced irrationalism from abroad early on. Regarding the diverse trends among young people, such as entering politics, business, "playing literature," "Trotskyism" (taking the TOEFL to go abroad), and "Mahjongism" (playing mahjong), he believes it is a normal phenomenon. He emphasizes that in modern society, people can choose to participate in national and social affairs, focus on doing their own job well, or just want to take care of themselves and their small family. Affirming pluralism itself is a way to promote pluralism. Of course, he also hopes for economic and political pluralism, and through legal systems to make pluralism irreversible. On the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, Li Zehou sums up eight words: "pluralism, tolerance, rationality, rule of law," aiming to implement the May Fourth tradition in various aspects of real life.

Li Zehou's own academic pursuits seem to be pluralistic as well. He started with aesthetics but delved into Kantian philosophy for a while. However, the domestic philosophy community does not recognize him as one of their own, until a few months ago when he was elected as a member of the Paris International Academy of Philosophy, seemingly officially confirming his philosopher status. As for the three volumes of thought history that scan 2000 years, it shows that he is not "emotionally committed" in his academic pursuits. He once lamented his lack of authority on modern natural sciences, otherwise his writings would be "a different world." He acknowledges his lack of the ability to write tens of thousands of words on just four characters, so he "never intended to become a specialist in one field for life."

Once, he sighed with a friend ten years younger, "We are in between two generations. One side thinks we have gone too far, while the other thinks we are too conservative."

Overseas, some say that among Chinese scholars, only Li Zehou can truly enter the world stage, while domestic students are eager to surpass him. As for himself, although he is aware that "hope belongs to the next generation" and is willing to be a "vanguard for the king," he still declares, "I don't concede now."

### 中华民族需要建设性的理性——两代人中间的李泽厚

　　中华民族需要建设性的理性
    ——两代人中间的李泽厚
    本报记者  祝华新
    自从教条主义丧失在国内学界的统治地位，道术为天下裂，笔墨之争煞是好看。转眼１０年过去，从经济学到文学评论，年轻一代翼然而起，宣称真理标准讨论时期的老一辈学人已经完成可敬的历史使命，毫不谦虚地在学术讲坛上“抢班”。自然也有后生学子向“积淀说”和“主体性实践哲学”的始作俑者提出挑战，轰动一时后却发现这位“美学尊神”的地位远不是那么容易撼动。这位“尊神”就是５８岁的李泽厚，中国社会科学院哲学研究所研究员。
    早在５０年代关于康有为、谭嗣同思想的研究中，北大哲学系的高材生李泽厚就表现出对“接受模式”的叛逆倾向。３年前他对“五四”以来的中国思想史和文艺史作孤军深入的重新勘察，以一曲启蒙与救亡的双重变奏征服了莘莘学子。他的著作摆上了街头的个体书摊，摊主拉长嗓音叫着“李泽厚、托夫勒、弗洛伊德……”风光之至，虽然老派的学者听了不免摇头。
    可是，他的《中国古代思想史论》引起一些青年的失望。着眼于“为整个人类和世界的未来探索某些东西”，他较高估计了民族的伦理、审美遗产，却被疑为“新儒学”的同道，“背叛了自己”。他不得不郑重为文，与“新儒家”们划清界限。
    “我和青年朋友的分歧是两个问题，一个是关于非理性，一个是关于彻底反传统”，李泽厚说。一位博士生带着“感性生命的强烈冲动”，在一本畅销书中“与李泽厚对话”，抨击李泽厚“从来就缺少‘怀疑一切’的批判目光，缺少与传统观念实行彻底决裂的叛逆精神”，体现着“中国知识分子的人格弱点”。李泽厚迟迟未作回应，理由是从这类批评中他发现只是“一种情绪性的东西”，找不到“真正的理论挑战”。“作者发泄了年轻人对很多东西不满、愤怒、苦闷的反抗情绪，恨不得捣毁一切。我非常尊重年轻人的这种情绪，但何必用理论去面对或消解这种正当的情绪呢？”
    但他忍不住还要说些话：“目前年轻人中流行一种彻底反传统的现象，在某种程度上与红卫兵现象近似。当年的红卫兵那么狂热地‘砸四旧’、反传统，也是认为要产生一种新文化必须把旧文化彻底铲除掉。这种激烈的非理性的情绪反应冲力很足，有很大鼓动力量，但不能解决什么问题，很可能是一种破坏的力量。中国需要的是建设，而不是破坏。以前上上下下总讲‘破字当头，立在其中’，但并没有真正立起什么来。乱骂一通很容易，要正面作点学术建设却没有那么简单。中国缺乏的是建设性的理性，而不是非理性。”
    作为学者，李泽厚说自己不喜欢很多太富于情感的词，认定那些是“不科学的语言”，也不赞成那种“只有我对，你们都要不得”的心态。他希望提倡一点卡尔·波普的“你可能对，我可能错，让我们共同努力以接近真理”的精神。“中国现在最需要建立的，正是这样一种现代的宽容的、多元的心态。”
    这几年李泽厚一直在鼓吹多元化，反对思想文化定于一尊。他本人坚定地主张理性，却又较早地介绍过国外的非理性主义。对青年人中从政、经商、“玩文学”、“托派”（考“托福”出国）、“麻派”（搓麻将）等纷乱的趋向，他以为是一种正常的现象。他强调，在现代社会，人们可以选择忧国忧民的参与，也可以注重做好自己的本份工作，或者只想把自己和小家庭搞好。肯定多元化的本身就是推动多元化的一种方式。当然，他也寄希望于经济的多元化和政治的多元化，并通过法律制度把多元化确定下来，使之不可逆转。时值“五四”运动７０周年，李泽厚捻出８个字——“多元，宽容，理性，法制”，以期把“五四”传统“落实到现实生活各个领域中去”。
    李泽厚本人的治学似乎也是多元的。他以美学起家，却一度扎进康德哲学。不过国内哲学界多不认他为同道，直到几个月前他被大师荟萃的巴黎国际哲学院选为院士，好像才正式验明哲学家的身份。至于那扫描２０００年的３部思想史论，更显得他在学术上“用情不专”。他曾自恨对现代自然科学没有发言权，否则笔下将“另是一番天地”。他自认没有“就四个字写上数万言”的本领，所以“从来不想做一生治一经的专家”。
    有一次，他与小他１０岁的朋友刘再复同慨：“我们正处在两代人的中间，一方觉得我们走得太远，另一方则觉得我们太保守。”
    海外有人说中国学者中能真正走向世界的就数李泽厚，海内学子则耿耿于怀要超越他。他本人呢，虽然意识到“希望属于下一代”，愿“为王前驱”，但还是扬言“现在不认输”。
