Title: Pet Name

The kaleidoscope of life has a kind of affection that is irreplaceable. There is a tenderness that makes you eagerly set off on a long journey home. There is an invisible umbilical cord that crosses mountains and rivers, making the hearts of a child and mother beat as one. There is a warm call that is full of deep affection, yet it is so soft, so soft...

“Compliant child—” my first cry was accompanied by this pet name, accompanied by this eternal, unbreakable affection.

Compared to those resonant and bright names, this syllable is indeed not outstanding. Even because its homophone is similar to the name of a certain insect in the countryside, my childhood self was often teased by my playmates who wore split-pants as “spinning wife.” The budding self-respect of a child drove me to stand tall and proud with my given name on the land of my hometown, often leading to fights, until it attracted the attention of the elders in the village. One day, when I made an oral request to change my name, my grandfather, who had studied a few years of private school and done small business in Hankou, took off his old glasses and handed me a few red dates, solemnly explaining to my father how this pet name was appropriate both to ancient customs and to modern times. Half-understanding, half-not, I felt that what he said was as sweet as these red dates. After eating three dates, the matter of changing my name was dropped. Later, when nicknames like “Little Tiger,” “Black Skin,” and “Cow Boy” were called out loudly at the village entrance, I slowly realized that the pet name “Compliant Child” was indeed more meaningful and superior to them.

What I remember most is that not long after I started school, one day I returned home early from school. My father mistakenly thought I had skipped school, immediately canceling the reward for that night—a dish of leek and egg rice cakes—and leaving red marks on my small buttocks covered by blue cloth. When I woke up in a gentle caress, there was a soft voice calling my pet name, and there were drops of tears falling on my little face, “Compliant child, he wants you to become a person who lives up to your name!” Mother said, wiping the pet name along with her hopes for my success into every pore and every corner of my heart.

From then on, for every call filled with love, I responded with my heart. Although gradually I had a given name and even a pen name, from the family gate I entered the military academy gate, but in the deepest part of my heart, there was always a soft call accompanying me as I took up my pen and traveled south, north, west, and east. Friend Alan once laughed at my rustic pet name, but I laughed back at her for not having even a slightly rustic pet name, for not having a lifelong symbol to spread love.

Having been in the military for a long time, I couldn't often hear the call of my pet name, so cherishing the pet name became a unique sentiment among military personnel. It was the first Spring Festival after I entered the military academy. We were ordered to stay and celebrate the festival. To express our longing for our parents and to gain comfort for our hearts, my comrades-in-arms presented an unexpected finale at the celebration—an assembly of pet names. The unchanging hometown accents of the pet names made the young soldiers tearful and full of passion, and even the old general over sixty years old couldn't help but recall the past.

Yes, pet name, it has been a long time! You encouraged me to break free from the cradle, urged me to leave the cradle, tempted me to jump from the palm to the solid ground, urged me to leave the small village and walk towards the military camp, towards the city, towards expectation and maturity. But with the passage of time, you gradually faded away. But life is fleeting, while the pet name is everlasting. I wish you could turn into the highland wind of my childhood, soothing my weary forehead; I wish you were a gentle whip, lashing my sturdy shoulders when I am lazy.

　　乳名
　　刘礼大
    生活的万花筒里，有一种亲情无可替代，有一种柔情使你不禁兴冲冲踏上迢迢归路，有一根无形的脐带穿越关山万仞，让儿心和母心心心相印，有一声热切的呼唤饱含无限深情，却又是那样轻轻、轻轻……
    “仿贤儿——”，我的第一声啼哭就拥有了乳名，拥有了这永世化不开的深情。
    比起那些铿锵响亮的名字，这个音节确乎不算出众。甚至因为它的谐音与乡间某种昆虫名相近，童年的我时常被穿开裆裤的伙伴们戏谑为“纺线婆”。童蒙初开的自尊心驱使我要堂堂正正地用大名昂然挺立在故乡的大地上，少不了由此导致格斗，直至引起各方父老的重视。一日，面对我要求更名的口头申请，念过几年私塾、在大汉口做过小生意的祖父摘下老花镜，顺手递给我一把红枣，郑重其事地对父亲解释了这乳名怎样上合于古之典故，下适于今之时流。半懂不懂的我觉得他老人家所言，倒也如这红红的蜜枣一般津津有味。三把红枣落肚，更名之事告吹。后来，当“小虎子”、“黑皮”、“牛伢子”之类的乳名被村头地角粗声叫响的时候，我慢慢品味到“仿贤儿”这乳名真的比它们要高明和有意义些了。
    最使我难忘的是，刚上学不久，一次放学较早，父亲误以为我逃学，立即取消了当晚的犒赏——韭菜鸡蛋粑，并且在我的蓝细布掩盖下的小屁股上留下了红红的指痕。当我在一阵温柔的抚摸中醒来时，有切切之声轻唤着我的乳名，有滴滴泪珠款款跌落于我的小脸上，“仿贤儿，他是要你学做个名副其实的人哩！”母亲边说边用衣襟把这乳名连同望子成才的热望徐徐抹进了我的每一个毛孔，每一寸心田。
    从此，对每一声浸透了爱的呼唤，我都报以心声的回应。虽然渐渐地我有了学名乃至笔名，从家门进了军校门，但心殿一隅，总有声声轻唤伴我携笔从戎，辗转南北西东。朋友阿兰当年曾笑我乳名朴拙，我却反笑她没有一个哪怕是土气些的乳名，没能拥有赖以播撒情爱的永生的符号。
    久处军营，不能时时聆听到乳名的呼唤，于是珍视乳名成为军旅中人的独特情愫。那是初入军校的第一个春节，我们奉命就地度假，为了表达思亲之情，为了获得心灵的抚慰，战友们给联欢会献上了一个出人意料的压轴节目——乳名大汇串。乡音无改的声声乳名，使年轻的战友们热泪盈眶，豪情满怀，使年逾花甲的老将军不禁也回想起当年来。
    是啊，乳名，久违了！你怂恿我挣脱襁褓，煽动我告别摇篮，诱惑我从掌心跳到厚实的地面，催促我从小村走向军营，走向都市，走向期待与成熟。而随着物换星移，你渐渐隐去。可是，人生易老，而乳名常新。多想你化作儿时的高粱风，抚我困顿的额头；更愿你是温柔之鞭，懈怠时抽我这行将而立的敦实的肩。
