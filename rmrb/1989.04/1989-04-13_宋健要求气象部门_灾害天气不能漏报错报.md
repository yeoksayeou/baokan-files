The weather bureau must closely monitor the occurrence and development of droughts, disasters, and floods. It must uphold discipline, eliminate errors, and ensure that no disastrous weather is missed or misreported, thereby minimizing losses to agricultural production to the greatest extent possible. This was the demand made by State Councilor Song Jian at the national meteorological bureau chiefs' meeting held today.

The head of the National Meteorological Administration accepted an interview from a reporter during the meeting regarding how to strengthen support for agricultural production. He said that last winter and this spring, northern China, including Hebei, Beijing, Tianjin, Liaoning, and Jilin, experienced the warmest weather on record for the same period. Meanwhile, some southern regions had more rain, with more cloudy days and fewer sunny days, and slightly lower temperatures. The high temperatures in the north may lead to more severe pest infestations and increased soil evaporation. All regions should be vigilant against forest fires.

　　宋健要求气象部门
　　灾害天气不能漏报错报
    本报北京四月十二日讯　记者谢联辉报道：气象部门要密切监视旱情、灾情、汛情的发生与发展，严肃纪律，杜绝差错，确保不漏报、错报灾害天气的到来，最大限度地减少农业生产的损失。这是国务委员宋健在今天召开的全国气象局长会议上提出的要求。
    国家气象局负责人在会间就如何加强对农业生产的支持，接受了记者的采访。他说，去冬今春，我国北部的河北、北京、天津、辽宁、吉林等地，出现了建国以来同期最暖的天气，而部分南方地区雨水较多，阴天多，晴天少，温度略有偏低。北方温度较高，有可能导致病虫害较重，土壤蒸发量过大，各地需注意森林火灾的发生。
