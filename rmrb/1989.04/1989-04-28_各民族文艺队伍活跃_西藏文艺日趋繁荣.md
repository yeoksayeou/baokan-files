In recent years, the literary and artistic endeavors in the Tibet Autonomous Region have flourished, with a vibrant troupe of artists, primarily Tibetan, actively performing on the plateau.

The Tibet Autonomous Region established eight artistic organizations in 1981, including literature creation, fine arts, photography, music, dance, drama, storytelling, and folk art research. These organizations have focused on nurturing new talent and now boast over 500 professional members, some of whom are renowned writers, painters, photographers, composers, conductors, and singers both domestically and internationally. Some members have even been included in domestic and international dictionaries of artists and literature.

In recent years, Tibet has produced many excellent works that have won awards both within and outside the region, or have been introduced abroad. Tibetan photographer Wangqu's work "Spring at the Ancient Temple" won a gold medal at the Third International Photography Art Exhibition. Han Chinese artist Hanshuli's comic strip "Bangjing Meiduo" won a gold medal at the Sixth National Art Exhibition and subsequently won awards in England, France, and Switzerland. Tibetan writer Yixi Shanzeng's novel "The Survivor" won the National Minority Literature Excellent Award and was translated into Serbian-Croatian and Romanian, published in both countries. Han Chinese writer Qin Wenyu's novel "The Female Living Buddha" was adapted into a film after its publication, and recently, her essay collection "Green Snow" won the National Excellent Essay Award of the New Period.

　　各民族文艺队伍活跃    
    西藏文艺日趋繁荣
    新华社拉萨电（记者王浩）近几年来，西藏自治区文学艺术事业日趋繁荣，一支以藏族为主体的各民族文艺队伍正活跃在雪城高原上。
    西藏自治区于１９８１年成立了文学创作、美术、摄影、音乐、舞蹈、戏剧、曲艺和民间文艺研究８个文艺团体。这些团体重视培养文艺新人，现已拥有５００多名专业会员，其中一些是国内外知名的作家、画家、摄影家、作曲家、指挥家和歌唱家等。有些会员还被列入国内外出版的艺术家辞典和词林中。
    近几年，西藏有不少好作品陆续在区内外获奖，或被介绍到国外。藏族摄影家旺久拍摄的《古庙的春天》在第三届国际摄影艺术作品展览会上获金牌奖。汉族画家韩书力的连环画《邦锦美朵》在获得第六届全国美展金牌奖后，又在英、法、瑞士等国获奖。藏族作家益西单增的长篇小说《幸存的人》获全国少数民族文学优秀奖，并被译成塞尔维亚—克罗地亚文和罗马尼亚文在两国发行。汉族作家秦文玉的长篇小说《女活佛》出版后被改编拍成了电影，最近其散文集《绿雪》荣膺新时期全国优秀散文奖。
