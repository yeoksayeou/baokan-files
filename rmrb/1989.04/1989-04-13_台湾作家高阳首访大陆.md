Taiwanese writer Gao Yang is visiting the mainland for the first time. He was invited by the Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan Cultural Research Institute of Fudan University to participate in the fourth academic discussion on Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan literature, as well as overseas Chinese literature.

"One need not weep with tearful eyes at the sight of the mountains and rivers, for merely returning to one's homeland is a great blessing. I am Wu Zimu from the island of Penglai, and the dreams and shadows of Liang are now blurred." Gao Yang, whose ancestral home is in Hangzhou, returned to his homeland after being away for forty years to pay respects to his ancestors. He composed this poem on the plane to express his feelings.

Gao Yang's works, including "The Complete Biography of Empress Dowager Cixi," "The Affairs of Emperor Qianlong," and "Sunset at the Imperial Garden," totaling more than thirty volumes, have been published on the mainland. This time, during his visit to the mainland, he will discuss the publication and royalties of his other works with relevant publishers. As a practitioner of cultural exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, Gao Yang has facilitated the publication of works by mainland scholars in Taiwan. During his stay in Shanghai, he expressed his willingness to help mainland writers publish their works in Taiwan. As a historical novelist, Gao Yang believes that the phrase "division must lead to reunification" reflects the cyclical nature of history.

    台湾作家高阳首访大陆
    高阳是应复旦大学港台文化研究所之邀，来沪参加第四届港台文学暨海外华文文学学术讨论会的。
    “不须泪眼望山河，但得还乡福已多。我是瀛洲吴自牧，梦梁心影竟模糊。”祖籍杭州的高阳远离故土四十年后第一次回来祭祖省亲，他在飞机上口占此诗以吐心中感慨。
    高阳的《慈禧全传》、《乾隆韵事》和《瀛台落日》等三十多部作品已在大陆出版。这次来大陆，他还将其它作品在大陆的出版和版税问题与有关出版社面洽。作为海峡两岸文化交往的身体力行者，高阳曾为大陆学者的著述在台出版多方斡旋。此次在沪与上海作协座谈时，他表示，愿意为大陆作家的作品在台发表提供帮助。作为一个历史小说作家，高阳认为，“分久必合”这句话，反映了历史一定的周期性。
