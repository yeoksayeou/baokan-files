At the end of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California, there is a small town named Sausalito. This town, with a population of only seven thousand, has recently gained national attention by claiming to become the first "cholesterol-free town" in the United States.

Cholesterol is a type of fat found in the human body and also present in foods like eggs and beef. Excessive cholesterol in the body can disrupt blood circulation, block coronary arteries, and lead to heart disease. According to the organizers, the Sausalito Health Association, approximately one-quarter of American adults are at risk of heart disease due to high cholesterol levels. The town's initiative to become a "cholesterol-free town" aims to remind citizens to adopt low-cholesterol diets for better health.

Local businesses have enthusiastically responded to the call. Many ice cream shops have introduced new low-calorie, low-cholesterol products such as tofu ice cream and potato ice cream. A new type of pie without cheese has been baked in pie shops. Residents are eagerly purchasing fresh fruits and vegetables, replacing high-cholesterol pork with fresh fish. Cured meats and other high-cholesterol products are almost unheard of. Currently, other towns in the United States are reacting strongly, following suit and striving to become "cholesterol-free towns" as well.

　　无胆固醇镇
    美国加州旧金山市金门桥的彼端有个名曰萨赛利特的小镇。这个人口仅七千的默默无闻的镇子最近却由于声称要成为美国第一个“无胆固醇镇”而名扬全国。
    胆固醇是人体分解的脂肪物质中的一种，同时也存在于鸡蛋、牛肉之类食物中。人体内胆固醇含量过多会破坏血液循环，阻塞心脏动脉，从而引发心脏病。据主办者——萨镇健康协会称，美国成年人中约有高达四分之一的比例因体内胆固醇过高而正蒙受着心脏病的威胁。萨镇之所以力争成为“无胆固醇镇”，目的在于提醒公民们采用低胆固醇食谱以保护健康。
    该镇商人纷纷响应号召。许多冷饮店推出诸如豆腐冰淇淋、土豆冰淇淋等低热量、低胆固醇的新品种，馅饼店烘烤的一种新馅饼中没有乳酪……居民们竞相购买新鲜水果和蔬菜，以吃鲜鱼代替胆固醇含量较高的猪肉。肉类等腌制品几乎无人问津……眼下，美国其它城镇反应强烈，纷纷仿而效之，力争也成为“无胆固醇镇”。
