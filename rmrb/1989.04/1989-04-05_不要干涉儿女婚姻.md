Observation Platform

In early February, I went to the countryside and heard that in the same village, two young couples committed suicide because their parents opposed their free-choice marriages. One of the cases involved a young woman surnamed Liu and a young man surnamed Zhang from the same village who were in a free-choice relationship. When the girl's parents found out, they strongly opposed it and wanted to marry her off to a man who worked in the city, was more than 20 years older than her, and had been divorced. The daughter refused, so her parents locked her in the house and beat her with a whip, saying they would beat her to death if she didn't comply. The young woman, after much difficulty, ran to the young man's house for help. Unfortunately, the young man's parents also opposed their marriage. Unable to understand the situation, the two jumped into the river and ended their lives. Such incidents not only occur in rural areas but also in government agencies and factories. According to a survey, in one county, out of 560 couples who registered for marriage last year, 410 had unhappy marriages due to arranged marriages; 37 couples either committed suicide or became mentally ill due to parental opposition.

Here, I advise those "well-meaning" parents to learn and understand the law, and not to destroy their children's happiness and waste their youth.

### 不要干涉儿女婚姻

　　不要干涉儿女婚姻
    ２月初，我下乡听说，同一个村有两对男女青年因自由恋爱遭到父母反对而自杀。其中，有一个姓刘的女青年和本村一个姓张的男青年自由恋爱，女方父母知道后，坚决反对，要把她嫁给一个在城里工作，比她大２０多岁的离过婚的男人。女儿不从，父母就把她锁在屋里，用鞭子抽打，并说，再不同意就要将她活活打死。女青年费尽周折，跑到男青年家里求救。谁知，男青年的父母也不同意他俩的婚事，他俩想不通，双双跳河自尽。像这样的事，不仅在农村有，在机关厂矿也有。据调查，我县有一个镇去年以来，结婚登记５６０对，其中包办婚姻造成感情不和的４１０对；因父母反对而造成自杀或精神失常的３７对。
    在此，劝告那些“好心”的父母们，要学法懂法，切勿毁掉儿女们的幸福，葬送他们的青春。
