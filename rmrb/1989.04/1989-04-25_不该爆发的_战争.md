The Unnecessary "War"

By Li Zhongchun, People's Daily Reporter

In April, the plains of Hebei are green with wheat fields and fragrant with pear blossoms. However, in some rural areas of Hebei Province, particularly in the vicinity of one of China's major oil fields, the Hebei Oil Field, the stains left by oil thieves have marred the once pristine landscape.

Near villages, in courtyards, and across fields, the black smoke from countless makeshift oil refineries billows into the sky.

Even the asphalt roads have been tampered with. Power lines from the oil field's high-voltage grid are diverted over the roads and into the villages, used for irrigation, water pumping, electric stoves, and small-scale manufacturing.

What the reporter has seen and heard indicates that the Hebei Oil Field is embroiled in a peculiar "war" of looting, theft, and sabotage!

A Vast "Battlefield"

The Hebei Oil Field spans 26 counties and cities in Hebei Province. According to incomplete statistics, in 1988, oil theft affected 7 counties and cities: Xian, Suning, Xiong, Anxin, Yongqing, Xian, and Renqiu. Electricity theft affected 12 counties and cities, with severe cases in Xian, Suning, Xiong, Xian, and Renqiu. In March of this year, Oil Extraction Plant No. 1 had 8 wells with stolen oil, 54 wells with stolen electricity, and 26 wells damaged. Oil Extraction Plant No. 2 had 6 wells with stolen oil, 706 wells with stolen electricity, and 92 wells damaged. Oil Extraction Plant No. 3 had 40 wells with stolen oil, 256 wells with stolen electricity, and 60 wells damaged. Oil Exploration Plant No. 4 had 3 wells with stolen electricity and 3 wells damaged. Oil Extraction Plant No. 5 had 340 wells with stolen electricity. In Xiong County's Xiaobu Village, 128 people participated in the looting and theft of crude oil, with 48 of them facing penalties.

Diverse "Tactics"

In the Chahe Oil Collection Area of Oil Extraction Plant No. 2, some individuals have divided the "battle zone" for convenience, naming areas like "Yang's Well" and "Zhen's Well," and prohibiting others from encroaching.

"Guerrilla tactics" are employed with ease. As soon as anti-theft personnel leave, new power lines are connected. On April 8th, in Xiong County's Dao Yi Village, reporters saw some villagers burying power lines underground to connect to their homes.

Some resort to "frontal assaults." In early April, anti-theft personnel from Oil Extraction Plant No. 3 removed the stolen power lines from Nan Dong Village in Xian County. On the 4th, over 400 villagers from this village attacked the oil field workers, injuring 3, destroying the doors of worker dormitories, and damaging some personal belongings. The disturbance lasted for 6 hours.

"Human wave tactics." On February 22nd, during the relocation of the 6070 team of the Exploration Company No. 2, 16 women and 6 children from Beixi Township in Shen County arrived at the well site, taking whatever they could. On March 6th, nearly a thousand farmers and some local officials, carrying baskets and buckets, pushing small carts, drained 3 tons of diesel from the oil tank at the well site.

Astonishing "Achievements"

In 1988, the state's production plan for Oil Extraction Plant No. 2 was 870,000 tons of crude oil. However, due to looting, theft, and sabotage, 80,000 tons of production were affected, accounting for 1/10 of the planned production. Based on the situation in the first quarter of this year, it is estimated that 100,000 tons will be lost.

In 1988, villagers in the oil field stole 67 transformers, 99,300 meters of high and low-voltage wires, destroyed 3 35,000-volt towers, and set up 186 illegal transformers, stealing 12,410 kVA of electricity and 30 million kWh. Since 1989, electricity theft has escalated. In the first quarter, approximately 11.58 million kWh of electricity were stolen, resulting in a loss of over 3.6 million yuan in electricity fees. Due to theft, power outages lasted 301 hours, and low voltage caused partial shutdowns in the oil field, resulting in a loss of over 6.6 million yuan.

When Will the "War" End?

It is not that "the battle rages everywhere," as Wenan County has seen no such incidents. Wenan County is adjacent to Xiong County. The leadership of Oil Extraction Plant No. 2 told the reporter that Wenan County has had no incidents of looting or theft of oil and electricity in recent years and has actively assisted the oil field's work. In 1988, when the oil field's drilling team was drilling well No. 25 in Xinglong Palace Village during the rainy season, the roads were muddy, and vehicles could not pass. They found the village cadres, who immediately organized the villagers to repair the roads. The county also issued a special notice, requiring townships not to make excessive demands on the oil field. After the oil field's property was lost, the local government and public security departments actively assisted in the search. The local area also sent militia to help guard the wells. When outsiders came to commit oil theft, the county's public security department also assisted the oil field in solving the case. The reporter saw in this county's Jiewei Village that the oil field's high-voltage power lines pass by the village's textile factory on the east side. This factory has an annual output value of over 8 million yuan, but not a single kWh of electricity has been stolen from the oil field.

To maintain the normal production and living order of the oil field and ensure that state property is not damaged, local governments must provide strong support. Although the Hebei Provincial Government pays attention to this issue, in 1987, the Provincial Public Security Bureau issued a notice on "Effectively strengthening the security of oil field production facilities," strictly prohibiting makeshift oil refineries. However, the threats facing the oil field have not been fundamentally resolved. A manager of an oil extraction plant told the reporter that they spend 2/3 of their energy on anti-theft and anti-looting efforts. It seems that to fundamentally solve this problem, local governments need to take effective measures.

### 不该爆发的“战争”

　　不该爆发的“战争”
    本报记者  李仲春
    ４月的冀中平原，麦田泛绿，梨花溢香，然而，在我国大油田之一华北油田所在地——河北河间、雄县等县农村一些地方，偷油者留下的摊摊油污，给如锦似缎的大平原涂上了斑斑污点。
    村庄旁、庭院里、田野上，座座土炼油炉喷出的道道黑烟，在空中缓缓飘荡。
    柏油路也安上了“拉锁”。搭在油田高压线上拖下的电线越过公路、引向村庄，用于浇地、抽水、电炉子和加工业。
    ……
    记者所见所闻表明：华北油田，正陷入一场被哄抢、盗窃、破坏的特殊的“战争”中！
    广阔的“战场”
    华北油田，分布在河北省内２６个县、市。据不完全统计，１９８８年度偷油涉及７个县、市，即河间、肃宁、雄县、安新、永清、献县、任丘；盗电涉及１２个县、市，严重的有河间、肃宁、雄县、献县、任丘等县、市。今年３月份，采油一厂有８口井的油被盗，５４口井的电被窃，２６口井遭破坏。采油二厂有６口井的油被盗，７０６口井的电被窃，９２口井遭破坏。采油三厂有４０口井的油被盗，２５６口井的电被窃，６０口井遭破坏。采油四厂有３口井的电被窃，３口井遭破坏。采油五厂有３４０口井的电被窃。雄县小步村乡崔村，竟有１２８人参加哄抢、偷盗原油，够处罚的有４８人。
    多变的“战术”
    在采油二厂的岔河集油区，有人为方便偷油，进行了“战区”划分，自称“杨家井”、“甄家井”等，不许他人插足。
    “游击战术”运用得驾轻就熟。反盗电人员刚走，后面又有偷电的线头搭上。４月８日在雄县道一村，记者看到有些村民将电线埋入地下引入家中。
    有的干脆进行“攻坚战”。４月初，采油三厂反盗电人员将河间县南冬村盗电的电线带回。４日，这个村４００余村民到油田围攻职工，打伤３名工人，毁坏职工宿舍的门和一些生活用品，闹事前后持续６小时。
    “人海战术”。２月２２日，勘探二公司６０７０队搬迁时，深县北溪乡村１６名妇女、６个小孩来到井场，见什么拿什么。３月６日，近千名农民和当地部分干部背筐提桶，推着小板车等，到井场把井队油罐内３吨柴油放光。
    惊人的“战绩”
    １９８８年，国家给华北油田采油二厂下达的原油生产计划为８７万吨。而因哄抢、盗窃、破坏等，影响产量８万余吨，占下达原油生产计划的１／１０。今年按第一季度情况推算，要损失１０万吨左右。
    １９８８年，村民在油田偷变压器６７台、高低压导线９．９３万米，破坏３５千伏铁塔３座，私设窃电变压器１８６台，盗电力１２４１０千伏安，盗电量３０００万度。１９８９年以来，盗电活动愈演愈烈。第一季度盗电约１１５８万度，电费损失３６０多万元。由于窃电而使线路停电３０１小时和电压过低，致使部分油田停工，损失达６６０多万元。
    “战争”何时休
    并非“战火遍地燃”，文安县就无“战事”。文安县与雄县毗邻。采油二厂的领导对记者谈到，文安县近几年基本上未发生哄抢、盗窃油、电的事件，而且能主动协助油田工作。１９８８年油田采油队在兴隆宫村打２５井时正值雨季，道路泥泞，车辆无法通行，他们找到村干部，干部立即组织群众修整道路。县里还专门发文，要求乡镇不能向油田提过分要求。油田财物丢失后，当地政府、公安部门积极协助查找。地方还派民兵帮助护井。外县有人来这里偷油作案时，县公安部门也帮助油田破案。记者在这个县界位村看到，油田高压电线就从村地毯厂东边经过，这个厂年产值８００多万元，电力不足，但没偷油田１度电。
    维护油田正常的生产、生活秩序，保证国家财产不受损失，需地方政府大力协助。虽然河北省各级政府对此比较重视，１９８７年省公安厅下发了“关于切实加强油田生产设施安全保卫工作”的通知，明令禁止土炼油炉。但是，油田面临的威胁没有得到根本改观。一位采油厂厂长对记者说，他们２／３的精力要用在反偷盗、哄抢上。看来，根本上解决这一问题，还需要当地政府采取切实有效的措施。
