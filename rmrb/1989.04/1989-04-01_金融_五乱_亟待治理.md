The "five disorders" in the financial sector need to be rectified urgently. Currently, there are "five disorders" in the financial sector.

First, the disorder of setting up financial institutions. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently about 300 banking and non-banking financial institutions in Luoyang, Henan Province. Among these, there are more than 60 non-banking financial institutions such as trust and investment companies and urban credit cooperatives. Many financial institutions are not set up based on business needs but to seize territory. In an area less than 100 meters in diameter, there are three to five financial institutions. Some of these financial institutions belong to banks, some to enterprises, some to government agencies, and some are operated by private individuals.

Second, the disorder of indiscriminately attracting deposits. To attract deposits, some financial institutions arbitrarily raise interest rates.

Third, the disorder of lending funds indiscriminately. Some non-banking financial institutions directly borrow money from enterprises to issue loans. A branch of a bank borrowed over 20 million yuan from another province. This money was lent out and has not been recovered to this day, causing the bank to be unable to repay the borrowed funds.

Fourth, the disorder of setting up enterprise accounts indiscriminately. Some financial institutions, in order to compete for deposits and attract customers, arbitrarily set up accounts for enterprises. Now, some enterprises, to avoid banks recovering loans, have accounts in multiple financial institutions, which has become a common phenomenon. For example, a certain company in Luoyang has accounts in three banks and two credit cooperatives, borrowing a total of over 40 million yuan from different places. A certain unit originally had an account in the Industrial and Commercial Bank and borrowed over 10 million yuan. To avoid the bank recovering the loan, it opened accounts in the Agricultural Bank and a credit cooperative, depositing its income into the new accounts, making it impossible for the original lending bank to recover the loan.

Fifth, the disorder of arbitrary assignments. Some financial institutions, to complete their deposit targets, arbitrarily assign deposit quotas to account-opening units. Some government agencies forcibly stipulate that section-level cadres must deposit 200 yuan, bureau-level cadres 100 yuan, and ordinary cadres 50 yuan. Some enterprises deduct employees' salaries and force them to save.

The "five disorders" have brought about very serious harm:

They weaken the central bank's ability to conduct macroeconomic control. The disorderly establishment of financial institutions, multiple management bodies, and multiple sources of funds make it difficult for the central bank to manage, supervise, and coordinate.

They weaken the specialized banks' supervision and management of credit funds. Some enterprises use the method of opening multiple accounts and borrowing from multiple sources, making it impossible to repay the loans that should be repaid. How can financial institutions adjust the credit structure and optimize the allocation of funds if they cannot recover the loans?

They cover up the contradictions in the poor management of enterprises. Some enterprises with very poor performance, even on the verge of bankruptcy, are barely surviving with the support of multiple financial institutions.

The "five disorders" in the financial sector have seriously affected the normal operation of the economy and must be rectified.

### 金融“五乱”亟待治理

　　金融“五乱”亟待治理
    目前金融业有“五乱”。
    一、乱设金融机构。据不完全统计，当前河南洛阳市银行金融机构和非银行金融机构约有３００多家，其中非银行金融机构如信托投资公司、城市信用社等有６０多家。许多金融机构的设置，不是根据业务需要，而是为了抢占地盘。有一处方圆不到百米的地方，就设有三五家金融机构。这些金融机构，有些属银行，有些属企业，有些属政府机关，有些承包给私人经营。
    二、乱拉存款。为了吸收存款，有的金融机构随意抬高利率。
    三、乱借资金发放贷款。有的非银行金融机构直接从企业单位借钱发放贷款。有家银行办事处从外省借资金２０００多万元，这笔款贷出后，至今难以收回，致使这家银行无力偿还所借的资金。
    四、乱立企业帐户。有些金融机构为争夺存款，招徕客户，便随意为企业开立帐户。现在，一些企业为逃避银行收取贷款，在多家金融机构开立帐户已成普遍现象。如洛阳市某公司竟在３家银行和两家信用社开立帐户，分头贷款４００多万元。某单位原在工商银行开户贷款１０００多万元，为逃避银行回收贷款，竟又在农业银行和一家信用社开立帐户，将收入存进新开户银行，使原贷款银行无法收回贷款。
    五、乱摊派。有的金融机构为了完成存款任务，向开户单位摊派存款。有的政府机关强行规定，局级干部必须存款２００元，科级干部存款１００元，一般干部存款５０元。有的企业扣发职工的工资，强行储蓄。
    “五乱”带来了十分严重的危害：
    削弱了中央银行宏观调控能力。金融机构乱设乱建，多头管理，且资金来源渠道多，使中央银行难以管理、监督和协调。
    削弱了专业银行对信贷资金的监督、管理。一些企业采取多头开户，多头贷款的办法，致使该归还的贷款不归还。金融机构无法收回贷款，怎能调整信贷结构、优化资金投向呢？
    掩盖了企业经营不善的矛盾。一些效益极差，甚至濒临倒闭的企业，在多家金融机构的支持下，勉强支撑生存。
　　金融业的“五乱”已严重影响到经济的正常运行，必须加以整顿。
