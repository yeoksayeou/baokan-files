Ceausescu said Romania has the capability to produce nuclear weapons.

According to a report by *Scînteia* today, Ceausescu made the above statement during a speech at the full meeting of the National Council of the Socialist Unity and Democracy Front of Romania on April 14. He said in his speech, "We have a fully developed industry... We have the capability to produce all kinds of machinery and equipment and can compete in any field with the best products in the world. But there is one area—nuclear weapons—where Romania does not want to engage in production, although from a technical standpoint, we have this capability."

He said Romania is firmly opposed to nuclear weapons and calls for the destruction of all nuclear weapons to build a world without weapons and without war.

　　罗有能力但不制造核武器
    新华社布加勒斯特４月１５日电　齐奥塞斯库总统说，罗马尼亚有能力制造核武器。
    据《火花报》今天报道，齐奥塞斯库是在１４日召开的罗社会主义民主和团结阵线全国委员会全会上发表讲话时作上述表示的。他在讲话中说，“我们拥有全面发展的工业……有能力生产出各种机器设备，并能在任何领域同世界最好的产品竞争。但有一个领域——核武器，罗不想投入生产，尽管从技术角度上说，我们有这种能力。”
    他说，罗坚决反对核武器，呼吁销毁所有核武器，以建立一个没有武器，没有战争的世界。
