Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 31st.

Education was a key issue discussed at the recently concluded 13th Plenum of the Czechoslovak Communist Party (CPCz). CPCz Central Committee Presidium member and Central Committee Secretary Fojtík, in his report on the tasks of education in the context of reform, pointed out that developing and modernizing the education sector is a decisive condition for economic development and social progress. He emphasized that the current reforms in Czechoslovakia have posed extremely arduous tasks for education.

How to cultivate builders according to the needs of social development is a concern for the entire society. Since last year, Czechoslovakia has conducted a nationwide analysis and discussion on the current state of education, concluding that over the past 40-plus years, the country's education sector has made significant progress.

However, there are several pressing issues in Czechoslovakia's education development, such as inadequate education funding, which accounts for only 5.5% of national income, placing it in the middle to lower range among European countries. Teachers' salaries are 10% lower than those of individuals with the same level of education in the economic sector. In vocational and university education, there are also issues regarding the further improvement of the existing system. Fojtík believes that investment in education is the most profitable investment, and education funds should be increased and not diverted for other purposes.

In discussing the improvement of Czechoslovakia's university education, he proposed that to enable more young people to receive higher education, traditional practices should be broken, and two-tier universities should be established. Additionally, various methods should be used to vigorously cultivate graduate students and further improve the quality of specialized talents. To enhance universities' initiative in cultivating talents, they should be granted more autonomy.

This Central Committee Plenum passed a resolution on education, emphasizing the need to expand schools' authority in cultivating talents, strengthen the democratization of management, and improve teachers' status.

　　捷共中央全会重点讨论教育
    发展教育是经济社会进步决定性条件之一
    新华社布拉格３月３１日电  （记者刘天白）教育问题是今天闭幕的捷共１３中全会讨论的重要议题之一。捷共中央主席团委员、中央书记福伊季克在会上作关于教育在改革形势下的任务的报告时指出，发展教育事业，并使之现代化，是经济发展和社会进步的决定性条件之一。他强调，捷目前进行的改革，为教育提出极为艰巨的任务。
    如何根据社会发展的需要，培养建设人才，是全社会关心的问题。捷从去年起在全国范围内对教育的现状进行了分析和讨论，认为４０多年中，捷教育事业有了很大发展。
    但是，捷的教育发展存在一些急待解决的问题，如教育经费不足，只占国民收入的５．５％，在欧洲诸国中处于中下水平；教师工资比经济部门同等学历的人低１０％。在中等技工学校和大学教育中，也存在着如何进一步完善现行制度问题。对此，福伊季克认为，对教育的投资是最富有效益的投资，应增加教育经费，并且不得把这笔款项移作它用。
    他在谈到改进捷大学教育问题时提出，为了让更多的青年接受高等教育，要打破常规，开设两种层次的大学，并且通过各种方式大力培养研究生，进一步提高专门人才的素质。为了提高大学在培养人才方面的积极性，应给予大学更多的自主权。
    这次中央全会就教育问题通过了一项决议，强调要扩大学校在培养人才方面的权限，加强管理的民主化和提高教师的地位。
