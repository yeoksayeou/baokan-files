The first train enters Shaanbei

	The first train on the Baotou-Shenmu Railway, a key project during China's Seventh Five-Year Plan, has been successfully laid after two and a half years of intensive construction by the 19th, 17th, and 14th Engineering Bureaus of the Ministry of Railways.

	The Baotou-Shenmu Railway is a supporting project for the first phase of the Shenfu-Dongsheng coalfield, one of China's super-large coalfields. It starts from Wanshuiquan Station in Baotou, Inner Mongolia, crosses the numerous gullies of the Ordos Plateau, passes through the Kubuqi and Maowusu deserts, and ends in Daliuta, Shenmu County, Shaanxi Province, with a total length of 172 kilometers. The designed annual transportation capacity is 100 million tons. This local railway is jointly funded and constructed by the Huadian Precision Coal Company and the provinces of Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia. The completion of this line is of great significance in alleviating the tight supply of coal in China and changing the backward appearance of the old, poor, and border regions of Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia.

　　首列火车开进陕北
    本报内蒙古东胜４月１０日电　国家“七五”期间重点建设项目——包头神木铁路，经铁道部十九、十七、十四工程局两年半的紧张施工，于昨天全线胜利铺通。
    包神铁路是我国超大型煤田——神府东胜煤田首期工程的配套项目。它北起内蒙古包头市万水泉车站，跨过鄂尔多斯高原的千沟万壑，穿越库布其、毛乌素两大沙漠，南到陕北神木县大柳塔，全长１７２公里，设计年运输能力为１０００万吨。这条地方铁路由华能精煤公司和陕西、内蒙古两省区集资兴建。该线的建成，对于缓和我国煤炭供应紧张局面，改变陕西和内蒙古老、少、边、穷地区落后面貌具有十分重要的意义。
