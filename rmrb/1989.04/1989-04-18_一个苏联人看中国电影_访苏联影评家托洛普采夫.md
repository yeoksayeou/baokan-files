A Soviet Views Chinese Films — Interview with Soviet Film Critic Toloptsov
Lǐ Ěrbō

Soviet film critic Toloptsov is the only expert in the Soviet Union currently studying Chinese films and can speak fluent Chinese. In early March, Toloptsov came to China with the head of the Moscow Film Festival, Khadzayev, to select films for the Moscow International Film Festival.

Toloptsov told me: "Since 1967, I have specialized in studying Chinese films and translating a large number of Chinese plays. He said: "Last year, the Soviet Union held the Odessa Entertainment Film Festival, and you sent 'The Last Empress' to participate in the competition, which was not very appropriate. I think it is important to choose what type of film to participate in what kind of film festival. You should pay attention to the selection."

This time, the Soviet guests watched "The Evening Bell," "Arc Light," "The Republic Will Not Forget," "Heavenly Revenge," and "Invincible Couple" at the China Film Company and believed that except for "The Evening Bell" and "Arc Light," the rest were not suitable for participating in the Moscow International Film Festival.

Toloptsov believes that Zhang Junzhao's "Arc Light" is a true film. "Arc Light" looks at the world with human eyes and studies the world through the feelings of the characters, which is universal. "Zhang Junzhao's 'One and Eight,' 'The Lonely Murderer' are also good," Toloptsov said. "'One and Eight' has character close-ups similar to 'The Evening Bell.' They are not directly expressing ideas. 'The Lonely Murderer' is a breakthrough in martial arts films. It expresses more important content through the form of martial arts, so when I watched the film, I almost forgot it was a martial arts film. This film also has a bit of the atmosphere of Kurosawa's films."

Toloptsov has always been very concerned about new Chinese films. He likes Chen Kaige's "Yellow Earth" very much, thinking that there is little dialogue and the film is composed of images rather than dialogue.

"I don't know why 'King of the Children' did not win an award at Cannes," Toloptsov said. "Perhaps Western audiences do not understand the background of China's 'Cultural Revolution.' But some Soviet film critics think 'King of the Children' is very good. They disagree with some Western critics' views."

"I have seen Wu Ziniu's previous films, all of which are very good. 'The Evening Bell' is an excellent film. I also like Tian Zhuangzhuang very much. His 'Hunting Ground' has the characteristics of a documentary and is a very realistic film. 'The Horse Thief' is even better, but the audience cannot understand it. Tian Zhuangzhuang's 'The Drummer' is quite ordinary. I have read several articles written by Tian Zhuangzhuang and feel that he is not only a talented director but also has his own thoughts. His mother, Yu Lan, has a film 'Revolutionary Family' that participated in the Moscow Film Festival and won an award."

"'Red Sorghum' is the best Chinese film," Toloptsov said. "A Chinese critic said: 'Red Sorghum' symbolizes the end of the Fifth Generation, meaning that the Fifth Generation has reached its peak and can no longer explore. I disagree with this view. My opinion is that young directors should have a broader vision and be able to see the direction of future development. The development of past Chinese films has been staged, and they have not been able to inherit, connect, and develop well in each stage. 'Red Sorghum' overcame the episodic nature of Chinese classical literature and art, opening people's eyes. It is China's first world-class film, and this is its greatest achievement."

"Chinese films in the 1950s and 1960s were in the process of moving from the stage to real cinema," he said. "The stage is the past of Chinese cinema, and Chinese cinema began with the stage. At that time, many directors studied drama and made dramatic films. I really like the film 'White-Haired Girl' directed by Shu Hua. The actress Dan Hua's eyes are very expressive, and we understand the characteristics of the characters through her eyes."

Toloptsov expressed his liking for Guo Wei's "Capturing Mount Hua." "I really like the soldiers in the film. They do not know what their next action will be. The audience also does not know what the soldiers will do next."

"I admire Xie Jin's films. Zhu Dakai's criticism is a bit too much. I think Xie Jin is a genius, and his films are masterpieces in the history of Chinese cinema. I think we should respect Xie Jin's style. Although his style is not contemporary, it is rich in art. I think he also understands that the development of cinema requires a new style. The future of Chinese cinema is not Xie Jin's style, but the style of the Fifth Generation directors."

Regarding Chinese female directors, Toloptsov told me: "I really like Huang Shuqin. Her 'Eternal Spring' participated in the Tashkent Film Festival. Her 'Childhood Friends' is a breakthrough in historical theme films. It already has personal descriptions, and we can understand history through the protagonist. After watching her 'Love Between a Human and a Ghost,' I feel that she is no longer the Huang Shuqin of the past. Last time, we really wanted to select 'Love Between a Human and a Ghost' to participate in the Tashkent Film Festival, but you decided to send 'Logan.' 'Love Between a Human and a Ghost' is a film that truly cares about human nature."

Regarding the development of Chinese films, Toloptsov said: "If Chinese films only focus on art films and do not consider the general audience, it will be difficult to develop. Because art and the audience need to cultivate each other. More and more living people appear on the Chinese screen. Chinese films are becoming more international and are increasingly winning awards internationally. I feel that this is the direction in which Chinese films are heading towards the world."

### 一个苏联人看中国电影——访苏联影评家托洛普采夫

　　一个苏联人看中国电影
　　——访苏联影评家托洛普采夫
　　李尔葳
    苏联影评家托洛普采夫是苏联目前唯一的一位研究中国电影的专家，能说一口流利的汉语。３月初，托洛普采夫随莫斯科电影节负责人哈德扎耶夫来中国为莫斯科国际电影节选片。
    托洛普采夫告诉我：从１９６７年开始，他就专门研究中国电影，同时翻译大量的中国剧作。他说：“去年苏联举办敖德萨娱乐电影节，你们选送《末代皇后》去参赛，这不太合适。我想，选择什么类型的影片，参加什么性质的电影节，这一点很重要，你们应该注意选择。”
    这次来中国选片，苏联客人在中影公司看了《晚钟》、《弧光》、《共和国不会忘记》、《天国恩仇》、《无敌鸳鸯腿》等影片后认为，除了《晚钟》和《弧光》外，其余均不适合参加莫斯科国际电影节。
    托洛普采夫认为，张军钊的《弧光》是一部真正的电影。《弧光》用人的眼光看世界，通过研究人物的感觉看世界，这一点是世界性的。“张军钊的《一个和八个》、《孤独的谋杀者》都不错”，托洛普采夫说。“《一个和八个》的人物特写和《晚钟》有些相似，它们都不是直接表现意念的。《孤独的谋杀者》是对功夫片的突破，它是通过功夫的形式表现更重要的内容，所以我在看片时几乎忘了这是功夫片。此片还有点黑泽明影片的气氛。”
    托洛普采夫对中国新电影一直很关注，他很喜欢陈凯歌的《黄土地》，认为对话很少，不是通过对话而是通过画面构成电影的形象。
    “我不知道《孩子王》在戛纳为什么没有获奖。”托洛普采夫说：“也许是西方观众不了解中国‘文革’的背景。但苏联有些影评家认为《孩子王》很不错，他们不同意西方某些评论家的观点。”
    “我看过吴子牛以前导演的片子，都很好。《晚钟》是非常优秀的影片。我也很喜欢田壮壮。他的《猎场扎撒》有纪录片的特色，是很写实的电影。《盗马贼》更好，可惜观众不能理解。田壮壮的《鼓书艺人》则很一般。我看过几篇田壮壮写的文章，觉得他不只是位有才华的导演，而且有自己的思想。他的母亲于蓝有一部电影《革命家庭》参加过莫斯科电影节，还获过奖。”
    “《红高粱》是中国最好的电影”，托洛普采夫说：“中国有位评论家说：《红高粱》象征着第五代的结束，意思好像是说第五代已到顶峰，再也不能探索了。我不同意这种说法。我的看法是应该让年轻的导演目光再开阔一点，能看到将来的发展方向。过去的中国电影的发展是有阶段性的，它们没有能好好地在各阶段之间继承、联系和发展。《红高梁》克服了中国古典文学和艺术中的章回性，打开了人们的眼界。它是中国第一部世界性的电影，这就是它最大的成就。”
    “中国五六十年代电影处于从舞台走向真正电影的路途中。”他说，“舞台是中国电影的过去，中国电影是从舞台开始的。那时许多导演都学戏剧，拍戏剧电影。我非常喜欢水华执导的《白毛女》，演员田华的眼睛非常有表现力，我们通过她的眼睛了解了人物特色。”
    托洛普采夫表示很喜欢郭维的《智取华山》。“我很喜欢影片中的那些战士。他们不知道自己下一步的行动是什么。观众也不知道战士们下一步要干什么。”
    “我很欣赏谢晋的电影。朱大可的批评有些过分。我认为谢晋是个天才，他的影片是中国电影史上的杰作。我认为应该尊重谢晋的风格。虽然他的风格不是当代的，但却是富有艺术的。我想他也理解电影的发展要有新的风格。中国电影的将来不是谢晋的风格，而是第五代导演那样的风格。”
    谈到中国的女导演，托洛普采夫告诉我：“我非常喜欢黄蜀芹这个人。她的《青春万岁》参加过塔什干电影节。她的《童年的朋友》是对历史题材影片的突破。其中已有对个人的描写，我们可以通过主人公了解历史。看了她的《人·鬼·情》，觉得她已完全不是过去的黄蜀芹。上次，我们很想选《人·鬼·情》参加塔什干电影节，可是你们决定送珞加诺。《人·鬼·情》是一部真正关注人性的电影。”
    关于中国电影的发展问题，托洛普采夫说：“中国电影如果只讲艺术片，不考虑广大的观众，是很难发展的。因为艺术和观众要互相培养。中国银幕上越来越多地出现了活生生的人。中国电影越来越有国际性，也越来越频繁地在国际上获奖。我觉得这是中国电影走向世界的方向。”
