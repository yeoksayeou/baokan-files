	Both to curb inflation and to prevent economic recession,
	the Federal Reserve "walks a tightrope"

	According to insiders, the Federal Reserve has recently adopted a strategy of "wait and see," deciding whether to further tighten monetary policy based on the impact of previous interest rate hikes on inflation and the overall economy. In reality, the Federal Reserve is not so much "waiting and seeing" as it is "walking a tightrope."

	Since Alan Greenspan took the helm of the Federal Reserve, he has regarded inflation as the enemy and has used interest rate hikes and monetary tightening to curb it. Signs indicate that Greenspan's move has begun to show results. According to the Commerce Department's recent announcement, the U.S. gross national product for the first quarter of this year, after excluding the rapid recovery of agricultural production, grew by 3%, lower than the 3.5% growth rate in the fourth quarter of last year. The inflation rate (consumer price index) increased from last year's 4.4% to 6.1%, but it was not as severe as expected. Based on other economic indicators released recently, the economic growth rate in the coming quarters is expected to continue to slow down, such as the decline in housing starts, personal consumption expenditure, and durable goods orders, as well as sluggish car sales and production cuts. The economic "cooling down" helps to ease the pressure on inflation, so the economic community generally believes that the current U.S. bank interest rates have basically "peaked," and the recent positive outlook for the New York stock market is largely based on this view.

	However, in the view of the Federal Reserve, the current economic growth rate is still higher than its ideal level, so it is still "waiting and seeing," trying to both curb inflation and prevent economic recession. This puts it in a "tightrope" situation. Generally speaking, the U.S. government has two main methods to curb inflation: one is to cut government spending, and the other is to raise interest rates. For the former, the Bush administration has reached an agreement with Congress to reduce spending, but people doubt whether it can be truly implemented. As for the latter, the Federal Reserve is unlikely to act hastily, because further raising interest rates risks triggering an economic recession. Therefore, the Federal Reserve's room for maneuver in the future is very limited. Public opinion polls show that the American public is unwilling to take the risk of an economic recession, and with the "overheated" economy already "cooling down," it seems that the Federal Reserve, which "controls the pulse of the U.S. economy," will not hastily raise interest rates at least in the near term.

　　既要遏制通货膨胀　又要防止经济衰退    
    美联邦储备委员会“走钢丝”
    据圈内人士最近透露，美国联邦储备委员会一个时期以来采取的策略是“等着瞧”，即根据前几次提高利率对通货膨胀和整个经济产生的影响来决定是否进一步紧缩银根。其实，联邦储备委员会目前与其说是在“等着瞧”，倒不如说是在“走钢丝”。
    自格林斯潘执掌联邦储备委员会以来，他就把通货膨胀视为大敌，并采取提高利率、紧缩银根的手段来加以遏制。迹象表明，格林斯潘的这一招已初见成效。据商务部日前公布，今年第一季度美国的国民生产总值在去除农业生产快速恢复的因素之后增长３％，低于去年第四季度３．５％的增长水平。通货膨胀率（消费物价指数）虽由去年的４．４％上升到６．１％，但并不像人们预计的那样严重。根据最近一个时期公布的其他经济指标，今后几个季度经济增长速度将继续放慢，如住房开工率、个人消费支出和耐用品订货下降，汽车销售不旺并决定压缩生产规模等等。经济“降温”有助于减轻对通货膨胀的压力，因而经济界普遍认为美国目前的银行利率已基本“到顶”，纽约的股票市场行情最近看好在很大程度上就是基于这种看法。
    然而，在联邦储备委员会看来，目前的经济增长率仍高于它认为的理想水平，因此它还在“等着瞧”，既要遏制通货膨胀，又要防止经济衰退。这就使它处于一种“走钢丝”的境地。通常来说，联邦政府遏制通货膨胀不外乎两种手段：一是压缩政府开支，二是提高利率。对于前者，布什政府已与国会达成削减协议，但人们对它能否真正兑现表示怀疑。至于后者，看来联邦储备委员会也不会贸然行动，因为进一步提高利率有触发经济衰退的危险。因此，联邦储备委员会今后的回旋余地是非常有限的。民意调查显示，美国公众不愿冒发生经济衰退的风险，再加上“过热”经济已在“降温”，看来“掌握美国经济命脉”的联邦储备委员会至少在近期内不会贸然提高利率。
