Prime Minister Takeshita today, at a banquet held in honor of Premier Li Peng, delivered a speech. The detailed summary is as follows:

	On this evening when we are gathered here for this small banquet, I would like to extend, on behalf of the Japanese government and people, our sincere welcome to Premier Li Peng and his wife, as well as the entire delegation.

	Meeting and conversing with Premier and his wife again brings to mind the scenes from last year's visit to China, where I was warmly received by the Chinese leaders and people, headed by Premier. The grand and enthusiastic welcome I received in Beijing and various places, the profound emotion I felt when I visited the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang, which can be said to be the starting point of cultural exchange between the East and the West, and the majestic Terracotta Army and the imposing Bell Tower in Xi'an are all unforgettable memories.

	The good development of Sino-Japanese relations is a precious fruit of the diligent efforts of many predecessors of the two countries, and the result of the dedicated work of many people from both sides. Tonight, we have invited many people who have long been engaged in the cause of Sino-Japanese friendship to attend the banquet. Once again, I feel deeply that to make the good Sino-Japanese relations advance by leaps and bounds and truly pass them on to the next generation is our wish and our important responsibility and obligation.

	To this end, we must adhere to the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and China, and on the basis of historical lessons, expand exchanges in various fields such as politics, economy, and culture, and further deepen friendship among all sectors. I have met Premier on several occasions, and we have formed a personal trust relationship, becoming friends who share each other's joys and sorrows, which is a very happy thing.

	Premier's visit to Japan this time will make a great contribution to pushing Sino-Japanese relations to a new stage and will add a glorious page to the history of Sino-Japanese friendship. Just now, I had a frank exchange of views with Premier, who has just arrived, on issues of common concern to both sides, confirmed that the relations between the two countries have been strengthened, and discussed the ways to further develop Sino-Japanese economic relations, achieving fruitful results.

	I am convinced that both countries should keep in mind the overall situation of Sino-Japanese relations in the world, and from a long-term perspective, continue to make solid efforts to maintain and develop peaceful and friendly relations, and the 21st century, which is said to be the era of Asia and the Pacific, will become a century of peace and prosperity.

	Starting from tomorrow, Premier and his wife will visit Tokyo and its suburbs, and then go to Seto Inland Sea and Kyushu. New and old friends are eagerly awaiting Premier and his wife's arrival. Now is the best season in Japan. Although the schedule is tight, if Premier and his wife can fully enjoy the spring scenery of various places, it would be our great honor.

    竹下首相在欢迎李鹏总理的宴会上表示
　　接受历史教训促进日中友好
    本报东京4月12日电　竹下登首相今天在为欢迎李鹏总理举行的宴会上发表讲话，详细摘要如下：
    当今晚在这里举行这个小宴之际，首先让我谨代表日本政府和国民向李鹏总理阁下夫妇及其一行表示由衷的欢迎。
    同总理阁下夫妇再次见面交谈，使我想起去年访华时承蒙以阁下为首的贵国领导人和国民的热情款待时的那一个个令人怀念的镜头。我在北京和各地受到的盛大而热烈的欢迎，踏进可以说是东西方文化交流的原点的敦煌莫高窟时的感动，蕴藏着悠久历史的西安大雁塔和壮观的兵马俑令人终生难忘。
    日中关系能取得良好的发展，是两国不少前辈们勤恳努力的宝贵结晶，也是两国有关人士尽心竭力的结果。今晚邀请不少多年来从事日中友好事业的人士出席晚宴。再次痛感要使良好的日中关系大踏步前进，并确实传到下一代，是我们的心愿，也是我们应尽的重大责任和义务。
    为此，必须遵循日中联合声明和日中和平友好条约的精神，在历史的教训的基础上，在政治、经济、文化等各个领域扩大交流，进一步加深各阶层的友情。我同阁下已数次见面，形成个人之间的信赖关系，已成为肝胆相照的朋友，这是很令人高兴的事情。
    阁下此次访日将为把日中关系推向新的阶段作出巨大贡献，并将在日中友好的历史上增添辉煌的一页。我刚才同莅临不久的总理阁下就双方共同关心的问题坦率地交换意见，确认两国关系得到加强，并就进一步发展日中经济关系的途径进行交谈，获得了丰硕的成果。
  我确信，两国都要把世界中的日中关系这一大局放在心上，从长期展望出发，继续为维持和发展和平友好关系作出扎实的努力，被说成是亚洲和太平洋时代的21世纪就会成为和平、繁荣的世纪。
    从明天起，阁下夫妇在考察东京及其郊区后，还要到濑户内海和九州访问，所到之处新老朋友衷心等待着阁下夫妇的到来。现在是日本一年当中最好的季节。虽然日程很紧，但如果阁下夫妇能够尽情欣赏春意正浓的各地风光，将不胜欣幸。
