Child Laborers! Child Entrepreneurs!

There are many young girls of the age shown in the left picture working in seafood freezing plants along the coast of Wenling County. Most of them are only fifteen or sixteen years old. Some dropped out of school after just one year of junior high to work in the factories peeling shrimp. When asked why they stopped going to school, they said, "Girls only need to know how to read a few characters. It's so practical to earn 200 yuan a month like this! What's the use of studying so much?" Such thoughts from such young minds are truly worrying!

The little girl in the right picture is only seven years old. Last year, she came to Panzhihua City with her parents. Her father slaughters pigs and sells meat, her mother collects fish bait, and she sells their goods. From morning to night every day, she can earn several hundred yuan a month. When asked, the girl said, "What's the use of studying? It's better to help dad and mom with their small business." The innocent words of a young girl certainly give one pause for thought!

    童工！童商！
    像左图中这么大年龄的小女工，在温岭县沿海的一些水产品冷冻厂里为数不少。她们大多不过十五六岁，有的读了一年初中便退学进厂剥虾仁。问她们为什么不上学了，她们说：“女孩子家会识几个字就行了，像现在这样，月收入二百元，该多实惠！读那么多书有什么用？”小小年纪，这样想事，岂不令人忧虑！

    右图中这个小女孩才七岁，去年随父母来到攀枝花市。父亲宰猪卖肉，母亲捞鱼虫，由她叫卖，每日从早到晚，一月也能挣几百元钱。问到这女孩，她说：“读书有啥用，还不如帮爸爸妈妈做小生意划得来。”幼女稚言，能不引人深思！
