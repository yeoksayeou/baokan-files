A Tight Fence Keeps Thieves Out
Public Security and Construction Departments Issue Notice Requiring
Improvement in Residential Security

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 17 (Reporter Zhou Lixian) In light of the recent increase in residential burglaries, especially those targeting civilian homes, the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of Construction recently issued a notice requiring improvements and enhancements to the overall security of residential buildings.

The notice points out that in recent years, the construction of urban residential buildings has developed rapidly, significantly improving the living conditions of the people. However, due to the lack of consideration for security factors in the design and basic facilities of some new buildings, criminals have found opportunities to exploit. They use methods such as breaking down doors, climbing through windows, and digging holes in doors to repeatedly commit burglaries.

Statistics show that in 1988, the number of residential burglaries nationwide increased by 46.8% compared to 1987, accounting for nearly 60% of all burglary cases, with the majority of these being burglaries of civilian homes.

To improve and enhance the overall security of new residential buildings, the notice requires local construction authorities and public security organs to strengthen coordination and cooperation. They should conduct a comprehensive investigation and research on the security of urban residential buildings, identify weak links, and propose practical improvement measures.

The notice also requires planning and design departments to further study residential security measures, strive to improve planning and design; research and production departments should strengthen the research and production of security materials.

　　“篱笆”扎得紧　窃贼钻不进
　　公安建设两部通知要求
    提高民宅安全防范能力
    新华社北京４月１７日电　（记者周立宪）鉴于近年来入室盗窃案特别是盗窃居民住宅案件增多，公安部、建设部近日发出通知，要求改善和提高居民住宅整体安全防范能力。
    通知指出，近几年来，全国城镇居民住宅建设发展很快，人民群众的居住条件得到改善。但是，由于一些新建住宅在单体设计与基本设施等方面未能充分考虑安全防卫因素，使犯罪分子有隙可乘，采用撞门、翻窗、挖门洞等手段连续入室作案。
    据统计，１９８８年全国入室盗窃案件数比１９８７年上升４６．８％，占全部盗窃案件总数近６０％，而其中盗窃居民住宅的又占多数。
    为了改善和提高新建住宅整体安全防范能力，通知要求各地建设主管部门和公安机关加强联系和协作，对城镇居民住宅的安全防范能力进行一次全面的调查研究，找出薄弱环节，提出切实可行的改进措施。
    通知要求规划设计部门进一步开展住宅安全防范措施的研究，努力改进规划和设计；科研、生产部门要加强安全防范材料的研究和生产。
