Sanmao, a Taiwanese writer who left the mainland 40 years ago, returned to Zhoushan Island in Zhejiang at the behest of her father and out of her longing for her hometown to trace her roots.

On the afternoon of April 20, as the ferry she was on slowly approached the shore, the welcoming crowd on the shore shouted "Sanmao, Sanmao" and rushed to the edge of the pier. Sanmao waved frantically from the deck, her eyes filled with tears. She said, "I once went to Jinmen and used binoculars to look at the mainland. I couldn't stop crying because it felt like I was seeing my mother. After coming to the mainland, I didn't want to wear high heels. I wanted to step firmly on the soil of my hometown." Now, she is walking on Zhoushan in flat shoes and a red jacket with jeans, firmly and genuinely.

Sanmao, filled with deep hometown affection, will visit relatives in Dinghai and Shenjiamen in Zhoushan City, and will go to Xiaosha to pay respects to her ancestors and trace her roots.

　　三毛回舟山寻根
    本报舟山２３日电  ４０年前离开大陆的台湾作家三毛，受父亲重托和出于对故乡的眷恋之情，回到浙江舟山岛寻根。
    ４月２０日下午，当她乘坐的渡轮徐徐靠岸时，岸上欢迎的人们喊着“三毛、三毛”涌向码头边。三毛在甲板上拚命挥手，满眼泪水。她说：“我曾到过金门，用望远镜眺望大陆，放不下来，因为我一直在流泪，好像看见了妈妈，不能自已。到大陆后我不愿穿高跟鞋，要平平实实地踏在故乡土地上。”现在，她就是穿着平底鞋和红外套牛仔裙平平实实地走上舟山的。
    三毛怀着浓重的乡情，将在舟山市的定海和沈家门探亲，并到小沙祭祖、寻根。
