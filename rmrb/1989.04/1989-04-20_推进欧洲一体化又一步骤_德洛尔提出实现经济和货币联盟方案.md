A step forward in European integration

    Delors proposes plan for economic and monetary union

    Our reporter Wei Wei reports from Brussels, April 18: On April 17, Jacques Delors, the President of the European Commission, submitted a report to the Economic and Financial Council of the European Community, which was in session in Luxembourg, outlining a plan for achieving a European economic and monetary union.

    To realize a "Europe of currency," the plan outlines three developmental stages. Starting from next July, when the capital of the 12 EC countries begins to flow freely, this will mark the first stage. The task of this stage is to further coordinate the economic and monetary policies of the member countries. Although there will be no rigid restrictions on the exchange rates between the currencies, all currencies should participate in the European Monetary System. This means that the currencies of Greece, Spain, Portugal, and the United Kingdom should also be included in the system. Furthermore, obstacles to the private use of the European Currency Unit will be gradually removed.

    The report believes that after the realization of a single market, the EC will have effective, structural policy tools, and after the governments of the member countries have signed a "new treaty" through negotiations, this will mark the beginning of the second stage. In this stage, a "European Central Bank System" will be established through legal procedures, gradually creating conditions to move towards the third stage: the creation and implementation of a common monetary policy.

    The report does not specify a timetable for the three stages.

    Delors' report will be submitted for discussion at the Madrid Summit in June. At that time, the 12 heads of state will make a decision on it.

　　推进欧洲一体化又一步骤    
    德洛尔提出实现经济和货币联盟方案
    本报布鲁塞尔４月１８日电  记者魏崴报道：欧共体委员会主席雅克·德洛尔４月１７日在卢森堡向正在举行的欧共体经济和财政部长理事会提交的一份报告中提出了实现欧洲经济和货币联盟的方案。
    为实现一个“货币的欧洲”，方案规划出３个发展阶段。从明年７月起，即欧共体１２国资本开始完全自由流通后，为其第一阶段。这一阶段的任务是进一步协调各成员国经济、货币政策。为此，对各国货币之间的汇率虽不作硬性限制，但各种货币都应参加欧洲货币体系。就是说，希腊、西班牙、葡萄牙和英国四种货币，也得纳入该体系。再者，欧洲货币单位的私人应用方面的障碍，将逐步扫除。
    报告认为，待单一市场实现后，欧共体已具备有效的、结构性政策手段之时，而且各成员国政府通过谈判签署了“一个新的条约”后，即标志进入第２个发展阶段。在这一阶段里，将按照法律手续，建立起“欧洲中央银行体系”，逐步创造条件向第３阶段冲刺：创设和实施一个共同的货币政策。
    对于３个阶段所要经历的时间，报告没有安排出一个具体日程。
    德洛尔提出的这份报告将提交６月间举行的马德里首脑会议讨论。届时，１２国首脑将就此作出决定。
