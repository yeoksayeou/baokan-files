The Fourth Showdown
— Prospects for the China-Sweden Men's Team Final

It's no coincidence that the two strongest men's teams in the world of table tennis, China and Sweden, have met again in the final. As predicted by most experts in the international table tennis community, China and Sweden defeated the Soviet Union and North Korea, respectively, in the semifinals with scores of 5:1 and 5:0, and now face each other in the final.

Will the results of the previous three World Table Tennis Championships between China and Sweden be repeated? Will the Swedish team, which has vowed to turn the tables, achieve its goal?

These questions have piqued the interest of fans. China has won the previous three finals against Sweden, once with a score of 5:1 and twice with a score of 5:0. It seems that the two sides have a significant gap, but that is not the case. In the past, the Swedish team often made mistakes at crucial moments, either by misusing their players or by having key players fall ill one after another, losing half of their hopes before the final even started.

The current Swedish team is different from before. Although the personnel, techniques, and playing styles have not changed much, they have long since understood the characteristics of the Chinese style of play. They have also gained mature experience in using their players and are eager to taste the flavor of being the champion, making their momentum quite aggressive. The Swedish team has a large number of players and more flexibility in their lineup. It is estimated that in the final, Waldner and Appelgren will likely both play, and the third player will be either Persson or Lindh, which is a bit unpredictable. Persson has performed better than Lindh since the start of the tournament, but he is more effective against European players and less so against Asians. Left-handed Lindh has a good record against Chinese players, but his emotions are easily affected. If he can control his emotions, the coach is more likely to use him.

The Chinese team seems to have no choice but to use the same three veterans from the previous tournament, as new players are not yet ready. The first three matches are crucial for China. If they can arrange their lineup effectively and start the matches well, as they have done in previous tournaments, their morale will immediately rise.

In short, this final showdown is unlikely to end quickly with a one-sided result.

　　第四次较量
    ——中瑞男团决战展望
    不是“冤家”不碰头。正如国际乒乓球界多数专家预料的那样，中国、瑞典这两支乒坛最强的男队，分别以５∶１、５∶０在半决赛中打败苏联队和朝鲜队，又在决赛中相逢了。
    前三届世乒赛男团中瑞决战的结果会不会重演？发誓要打个翻身仗的瑞典队能实现愿望吗？
    这些悬念吸引着球迷们的兴趣。中国队以往决战三次战胜瑞典队，一次５∶１，两次５∶０。看起来双方相差悬殊，其实不然。当年瑞典队总在关键时刻出点差错，不是用兵不当就是主力接二连三病倒，决赛没开球先输掉一半希望。
    现在的瑞典队和以前不同了，虽然人员、技术打法并没有多大变化，但对中国式打法的特点早已摸得一清二楚，用兵经验上也已成熟起来，加上憋着劲想尝尝当冠军队的滋味，气势上咄咄逼人。瑞典队兵多将广，布阵余地较大。估计决赛时瓦尔德内尔和阿佩伊伦两人多半会上，第三个人是出佩尔森还是林德，有点令人摸不透。佩尔森开赛以来成绩好于林德，但他打欧洲选手在行，对付亚洲人则不如林德。左手握拍的林德与中国选手交战成绩一直良好，然而他情绪容易波动。如果他能控制自己情绪，教练用他的可能性大。
    中国队用人看来无可选择，新手顶不上，只得用上届的三员老将打。前三盘对中国队十分关键，如能像前几届一样布阵对路，打好开头的比赛，士气马上就会上升。
    总之，这一次决战恐怕不会出现一边倒、很快结束较量的局面。
