Currently, 420 million residents nationwide have received their resident ID cards, accounting for 54.2% of the total issuance. It is estimated that by this year's National Day, 500 million people will have received their ID cards, and the system for using and verifying resident ID cards will be implemented nationwide by then. These details were provided at the National Resident ID Card Work Conference held in Beijing today.

Vice Minister of Public Security Yu Lei reported at the meeting that the majority of provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, capital cities, and some areas that have completed concentrated issuance of ID cards have released notices on the use and verification of resident ID cards.

Yu Lei pointed out that according to several sample surveys conducted in cities such as Shanghai, Chongqing, and Jinan, the highest percentage of citizens carrying their resident ID cards is 60%, while the lowest is only 10%. This indicates that a significant number of people still lack the necessary understanding of using ID cards. He urged all levels of public security organs to collaborate with relevant departments to strengthen propaganda efforts, enhance the awareness of checking resident ID cards in matters involving citizens' rights and interests, strictly enforce the law, and establish and improve the resident ID card verification system. He also revealed that the Ministry of Public Security is studying the issuance of a unified People's Police ID card to gradually improve the verification system.

　　查验居民身份证制度预计在国庆节前实施
    全国４．２亿居民已领到身份证
    据新华社北京４月２日电  （记者周立宪）目前全国已有４．２亿居民领到了居民身份证，占应发数的５４．２％。预计今年国庆节前可完成５亿人发证任务，并将在此节前在全国实施使用、查验居民身份证制度。上述情况是今天在京召开的全国居民身份证工作会议提供的。
    公安部副部长俞雷今天在会上介绍，绝大部分已完成集中发证任务的省、市、自治区、省会城市和部分地区发布了使用、查验居民身份证的通告。
    俞雷指出，从上海、重庆、济南等市组织的几次抽样调查情况看，现在公民随身携带居民身份证的比例最高的仅６０％，最低的才１０％。这说明相当多的群众对使用身份证还缺乏应有认识。他要求各级公安机关要与各有关部门配合，作为宣传工作，增强在办理涉及公民权益事务中核查居民身份证意识，严格依法办事，建立健全居民身份证查验制度。他还透露，公安部正研究适时制发统一的人民警察工作证，以逐步完善查验制度。
