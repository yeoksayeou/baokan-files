Some Western international giants have been flocking to invest and set up factories in Shenzhen. The relevant departments in Shenzhen have disclosed to reporters that they are planning to seize this opportunity to upgrade the industrial level and shift the industrial structure of the Special Economic Zone towards high technology.

It is understood that these international companies are planning to set up factories in Shenzhen with large investment scales, advanced technology, and most of them belong to the "two ends outside" projects. For example, the U.S. DEC Company will invest $3 million in the first phase to produce computer equipment; the French Thomson Company will invest HK$60 million in the first phase to set up a large factory, and one production line has already started production; the U.S. DuPont Company plans to invest more than $37 million in Shenzhen to produce rice herbicides, circuit board dry films, and paper, among other products. It is learned that famous companies such as IBM, General Electric of the United States, and Lancashire of the United Kingdom have also expressed their intention to invest and build factories in Shenzhen. In addition to these Western giants, some Eastern European countries have also come to Shenzhen to explore the possibilities of investment, joint ventures, and cooperation.

A responsible person from the Shenzhen Municipal Foreign Investment Office said that the enthusiasm of foreign investors shows that they have recognized the good investment environment in Shenzhen. Shenzhen is ready to seize this opportunity to develop high-tech industries, upgrade the industrial structure of the Special Economic Zone, and restrict the development of labor-intensive primary industries. He said that recently, Shenzhen has stopped some projects with outdated technology, unsecured funds, and products mainly for domestic sales.

　　西方一些国际大公司纷纷来深圳投资办厂
    新华社深圳４月１０日电　（记者姜军、向虎）深圳市有关方面向记者透露，近来西方一些国际性大公司纷纷在深圳投资办厂，深圳市准备借此机会提高产业层次，使特区的产业结构向高科技倾斜。
    据悉，这些国际性公司在深圳拟办的工厂投资规模大，技术先进，而且绝大部分属于“两头在外”项目。如美国ＤＥＣ公司首期投资３００万美元，生产计算机设备；法国的汤姆逊公司首期投资６０００万港币兴办一家大厂，目前已有一条生产线投产；美国杜邦公司计划在深圳投资３７００多万美元，生产水稻除草剂、电路板干膜和纸张等。据了解，著名的美国ＩＢＭ公司、通用电气公司、英国兰开夏公司等也都表示准备在深圳投资建厂。除这些西方大公司之外，东欧一些国家也接踵来到深圳探索投资办厂或合资、合作的可能性。
    深圳市政府引进外资办公室一位负责人说，外商投资如此活跃，说明他们看中了深圳良好的投资环境。深圳市准备就势发展高科技产业，对特区产业进行更新换代，并限制发展劳动密集型的初级产业。他说，近来深圳已卡住了一些技术不先进、资金不落实、产品大部分内销的项目。
