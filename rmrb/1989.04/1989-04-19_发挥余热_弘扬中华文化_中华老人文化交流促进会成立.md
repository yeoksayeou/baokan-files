The aim is to use culture as a medium to attract a wide range of elderly people to participate in various research, teaching, consulting, and cultural exchange activities, so that they can contribute their knowledge, experience, and wisdom to the "Four Modernizations" and the construction of a spiritually and materially civilized society. The Chinese Elderly Cultural Exchange Promotion Association was established in Beijing on the morning of April 15.

According to the third national census, by the end of this century, the number of elderly people aged 60 and above in China will approach 200 million. How to organize the elderly to make full use of their remaining energy and continue to participate in social activities within their capabilities is an urgent social issue and a new topic that needs to be studied and solved. The Chinese Elderly Cultural Exchange Promotion Association is a privately-run social organization with national legal person status. Its establishment is undoubtedly a good thing for organizing the elderly to contribute to the "Four Modernizations," to promote exchanges between Chinese people at home and abroad, and to promote Chinese culture. The association will carry out various activities beneficial to the physical and mental health of the elderly within the scope of the Constitution and laws, such as music, chess, calligraphy, painting, opera, film and television, art and craft, fitness and beauty, games and entertainment, cultural and technical consulting, editing, exhibitions, and tourism.

Liu Lantao, Fang Yi, Cheng Siyuan, and prominent figures from various circles in the capital attended the meeting. Ba Yi and others inscribed for the association. Zhang Youyu, the president of the Chinese Elderly Cultural Exchange Promotion Association, spoke at the founding ceremony. The meeting also received congratulatory letters and telegrams from home and abroad.

　　发挥余热　弘扬中华文化
　　中华老人文化交流促进会成立
    本报北京讯　记者赖仁琼报道：旨在以文化为媒介，广泛吸引老年人参加各种研究、讲授、咨询等社会和各项文化交流活动，使之把知识、经验、智慧献给“四化”和“两个文明”建设的中华老人文化交流促进会４月１５日上午在京成立。
    按第三次人口普查推算，本世纪末我国６０岁以上的老年人将接近两亿。如何组织老年人发挥余热，继续参加力所能及的社会活动，是个亟待研究解决的社会问题和新课题。中华老人文化交流促进会是“具备全国性社会团体法人资格”的民办社团组织，它的成立，对组织老年人为“四化”献力，联谊海内外炎黄子孙，弘扬中华文化，无疑是件好事。该会将在我国宪法和法律范围内开展有益于老人身心健康的各种联谊、交流活动，如琴棋书画、戏曲影视、美术工艺、健身健美、游艺娱乐、文化技术咨询及编辑、展览、旅游等。
    刘澜涛、方毅、程思远和首都各界知名人士出席大会。薄一波等为该会题词。中华老人文化交流促进会会长张友渔在成立大会上讲了话。大会还收到了海内外贺信、贺电。
