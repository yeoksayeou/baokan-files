On the morning of March 17th and 18th, the Yueyang City Committee of Hunan Province publicly held a selection and answering session for female division-level officials. News spread quickly, and nearly a thousand people braved the rain to attend, filling both venues to capacity.

167 people signed up, with 20 advancing to the answering session.

In December of last year, the Yueyang City Committee decided to publicly select division-level officials from female officials at the deputy section-level and above. A total of 167 people signed up. After the evaluation committee reviewed the papers and conducted a knowledge test, 20 individuals advanced to the paper defense stage.

This paper defense session lasted 40 minutes, with evaluations based on oral expression, responsiveness, comprehensive analytical ability, innovation, feasibility, and demeanor. The topics were selected by the defenders through a draw.

Niu Huijun's fluent responses earned enthusiastic applause.

The defense began, with each defender taking the stage to present their papers and answer questions. The examiners were composed of directors from various bureaus.

During the defense for the deputy director of the Labor Bureau, in addition to the mandatory questions posed by the host and the committee, the same question was intentionally asked to each defender to compare their on-the-spot adaptability and comprehensive analytical skills.

"Suppose you are selected as the deputy director of the Labor Bureau, how would you coordinate internal relationships?" This question posed by the examiner was answered by four individuals, with the most comprehensive response coming from 31-year-old Niu Huijun, the deputy section chief of the Women's Federation's Propaganda Department.

Niu stood up after noting down the host's question and calmly said, "To handle internal relationships, one must first clarify what kind of relationships exist. The relationship between the director and deputy director is one of leadership and being led; work-wise, one must be responsible to the director and actively perform assigned tasks. The relationship between deputy directors is one of peers; they must work together harmoniously. The relationship with subordinates is one of leadership and service; work-wise, one must trust and support, and in life, one must care and be considerate." After Niu finished, the audience erupted in enthusiastic applause.

Li Xiaoling demonstrated a strong competitive spirit.

On the defense stage for the deputy director of the Second Commerce Bureau, Li Xiaoling, the manager of the City Daily Necessities Company and an economist, performed exceptionally calmly and composedly. Her paper, "Discussing the Management Model of the Second Commerce Bureau," offered unique insights. She answered the committee's questions logically and convincingly. It was learned that this defender had already participated in "competition" twice. Previously, Li Xiaoling was the deputy manager of the Daily Necessities Company and was appointed manager through a recruitment process two years ago. Everyone praised her strong competitive spirit.

Wang Fengying's self-study achievements shone.

The defenses continued one after another. Among the female candidates for the deputy principal of the Municipal Vocational School, Wang Fengying's paper defense was particularly impressive and moving, earning continuous enthusiastic applause from the audience.

Wang Fengying, a self-taught individual, has spent 19 years on the educational front. During the defense, her paper "How to Do a Good Job in Students' Political Thought Work" was logical, concise, vivid, and inspiring. She answered five questions with clear focus, logical structure, and feasible suggestions.

"Your speech reflects your deep understanding of how to do a good job in students' political thought work. During your time as the secretary of the Communist Youth League at Yueyang County No. 1 Middle School, how was the work of the league?" an examiner asked.

Wang smiled and said, "To be modest, our school's league work was at the forefront in the entire county and city."

"Why, since you were doing well at Yueyang County No. 1 Middle School and the leadership trusted you, did you still choose to work at the vocational school?" the host asked.

At this moment, Wang Fengying, undisturbed by the noisy atmosphere, calmly adjusted her hair and said, "I aspire to develop myself and advance my career in a new environment. If I am appointed as the deputy principal of the vocational school, I will work with the school's leadership and faculty to run the vocational school well and cultivate talents."

At this point, the defense stage erupted in prolonged applause.

　　答辩场上
　　——湖南岳阳市公开招选女处级干部侧记
    蒋益祥
    ３月１７日和１８日上午，湖南岳阳市委公开举办招选女处级干部的答辩会。消息传开，近千群众冒雨亲临观看，两个会场座无虚席。
　１６７人报名，其中２０人进入答辩
    去年１２月，岳阳市委决定从副科级以上女干部中公开招选处级干部后，全市有１６７人报名，通过评委会评选论文，知识面测试，进入论文答辩的有２０名。
    此次论文答辩共４０分钟，按口头表达能力、灵敏性、综合分析能力、创新能力、可行性、气质风度等方面评分。题目由答辩人抽签选定。
　倪慧君对答如流赢得热烈掌声
    答辩开始了，答辩者一个个登上讲台，演讲论文，回答问题。主考官由各个局的局长担任。
    招选劳动局副局长的答辩席上主持人和评委除提出必答的题目外，还特意提出同一问题让答辩者分别回答，从比较中判断每个人的临场应变能力和综合分析能力。
    “假如你被招选为劳动局副局长，你怎样协调好内部关系？”主考官提出的这道题，４人都作了回答，答得较全面的要算３１岁的市妇联组宣科副科长倪慧君。
    小倪记下了主持人提出的问题站了起来，从容地说，要处理好内部关系，首先要明确是什么关系。局长和副局长，是领导与被领导的关系，工作上要对局长负责，积极做好分管工作；副局长之间是同级关系，要和衷共济，团结共事；对下级是领导和服务的关系，工作上要信任支持，生活上要关心体贴。小倪答完，场上响起了热烈的掌声。
　李小玲具有强烈竞争意识
    在招选二商局副局长的答辩台上，市日杂公司经理、经济师李小玲表现得格外沉着冷静。她演讲的《谈谈二商经营管理模式》的论文，具有独到的见解；她回答评委的问题，说得入情入理。经了解，这位答辩者已是第二次参与“竞争”了。以前，李小玲是日杂公司副经理，前年应招聘出任经理。人们对她具有的强烈竞争意识无不交口称赞。
　王凤英自学成才露锋芒
    答辩一个接着一个。应招市卫校副校长的几位女将中，王凤央的论文答辩精彩、动人，场上不断响起热烈掌声。
    王凤英，自学成才，在教育战线度过了１９个春秋。答辩中，她演讲的《怎样做好学生政治思想工作》的论文，条理清楚，言简意明，形象生动，富有鼓动性；她回答的５个问题，重点突出，层次清晰，设想可行。
    “你的演讲反映出你对如何做好学生的思想政治工作颇有研究，那么，你在岳阳县一中担任团委书记期间，你校团的工作抓的又怎么样呢？”一个评委这样问道。
    小王笑着说：“说句不谦虚的话，我们学校团的工作在全县和全市都是名列前茅的。”
    “你本来在岳阳县一中工作不错，领导又信任你，你为什么还要来卫校工作？”主持人问道。
    这时，王凤英没有被喧哗地场面所影响，用手理了一下头发，不慌不忙地说：“我立志在新的环境中求得自我发展和事业进步，如果我能出任卫校副校长，将和卫校的领导与师生员工一道，办好卫校，培养人才”。
    此时答辩场上响起长时间掌声……
