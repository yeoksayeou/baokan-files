Title: Analyzing "Resenting the Rich"

	“Why get angry?” This is the title of a short article recently published by the writer Qian Rong (see March 23, *Wen Hui Bao*). In this article, the author vividly analyzes the mindset of those who get angry when they see others earning more than themselves, and offers gentle advice to those who suffer from this resentment. I think those who suffer from this resentment will be grateful to the author, because the author understands their plight due to unequal opportunities and does not hastily label them with "envy."

	"Envy" is a term that has been frequently used in recent years. Although the "hat factory" has been closed for many years, seeing this term is like seeing a hat hovering in the air, making one wary of it falling on one's head. If "envy" is considered a hat, then this hat is likely to be placed on the heads of ordinary citizens. Because those who are not as successful, those without opportunities, and those without privileges are mostly law-abiding common people.

	Of course, if the hat fits, it cannot be considered as arbitrarily placing a hat on someone. At least it cannot be considered as arbitrarily placing a hat on someone. The hat of "envy" is undoubtedly fitting for those who are infatuated with the iron rice bowl and are eager to promote egalitarianism. However, there is an exceptional situation. For example, people are understandably resentful when they see others getting rich through "official profiteering," corruption, using power for personal gain, lawlessness, and exploiting loopholes in the reforms. But some people intentionally or unintentionally, to a certain extent, and without proper analysis, confuse this with "envy."

	It is certainly not right to simply "resent the rich," but one must also consider how they became rich. If someone is more capable than me, more knowledgeable than me, I accept that they have more. If someone works harder than me, is more resourceful than me, I accept that they have more. But if someone only has a bit of power or a good father or a good backer, can allocate scarce goods, can obtain loans... if they just have more crooked ways, can exploit policy loopholes and disregard the law, why should I accept that? If I don't get angry, wouldn't that make me too numb, too lacking in a sense of justice? In this situation, if you don't let me get angry, is that fair?

	Once angry, it is inevitable to complain and curse. A phrase that has been widely circulated in society in recent years is: "Pick up the bowl to eat meat, put down the chopsticks to curse." Regarding this phrase, the famous economist Li Yinning has three points of view, the second of which states: "When eating meat, he not only looks at the meat in his own bowl but also looks at how much meat is in other people's bowls. If his labor is not less than others', but the meat in his bowl is less than others', he will complain about the unfairness of income distribution." This is an explanation for the social and economic roots of "resenting the rich." It should be added that those who curse also look at how the extra meat in other people's bowls came about, where it came from, and besides unfair distribution, what other "tricks" there are. He sees it, he curses, and you cannot say that his cursing is entirely unreasonable, purely picking a fight.

	Getting angry and cursing is certainly not good, and it is not conducive to social stability and unity. To maintain stability and unity, we often say that we need the masses to understand the difficulties of reform, which is very correct. However, it is also necessary to supplement that, in order to achieve this goal, we must first understand the masses, understand why those who get angry and curse are angry and cursing. Listen to their voices, improve our work, and only in this way can we truly be understood by the masses, and the voices of anger and cursing will gradually decrease.

	For those who "suffer from this resentment," it is best to listen to Qian Rong's advice: "Why get angry?" Just getting angry is useless; one should turn the anger into enthusiasm for reform, promote the deepening of reform, eliminate evil, and promote the early elimination of social ills and the early takeoff of the economy. In this way, everyone will have more, and one will not "resent the rich" anymore.

### 析“气人有”

　　析“气人有”
　　焦加
    “干吗生气呀？”这是作家谌容最近发表的一篇短文的题目（见3月23日《文汇报》）。在这篇短文中，作者对诸如见别人比自己挣得多就生气的那种“气人有”的心态，作了生动的剖析，并给“患此气者”以委婉的劝说。我想，“患此气者”读了此文，是会感激作者的，因为作者理解他们因机会不均等而产生的苦衷，没有轻率地给他们扣一顶“红眼病”的帽子。
      “红眼病”是近年来使用频率颇高的一个词。虽说“帽子工厂”关闭多年了，可看到这个词，就仿佛看到一顶帽子在半空里晃悠，老得提防它掉在自己脑袋上。如果说
  “红眼病”也算一顶帽子，那么这顶帽子是极可能扣到普通百姓头上的。因为不如人者、无机遇者和无特权者，大量的还是守法的平民百姓。
    当然，帽子合适，是不能算扣帽子的，至少不能算乱扣帽子。“红眼病”的帽子扣给那些迷恋大锅饭、热衷于搞平均主义的人，无疑是合适的。然而，也有一种情况例外。比如，人们对因“官倒”、贪污受贿、以权谋私、违法乱纪和钻改革的空子发了财的，心里有气，本来是可以理解的。但有的人却有意无意地、或多或少地、未加分析地将此混同于“红眼病”。
    一味地“气人有”当然是不应该的，可也得看他是怎么有的。他能耐比我大，知识比我多，他有，我服气。他干得比我多，心眼比我活，他有，我服气。可是，如果他不过是掌点权或有个好爸爸、好靠山，能批出或调拨紧俏商品，能搞到贷款……不过是歪门邪道多一点，能钻政策的空子并置法律于不顾，我凭什么服他？我不气，不就太麻木、太缺乏正义感了吗？在这种情况下，你不让我生气，这公平吗？
    一生气，就难免发牢骚、骂娘。近几年社会上广为流传的一句话，叫做“端起碗来吃肉，放下筷子骂娘”，对于这句话，著名经济学家厉以宁谈了三点看法，其中第二点讲道：“同样是吃肉，他不仅看看自己碗里的肉，还要看别人碗里的肉有多少。如果自己的劳动不比别人少，而自己碗里的肉却比别人少，他就会埋怨收入分配不公。”这算是为“气人有”找到了一点社会经济根源。需要补充的是，骂娘的人还要看看别人碗里多出来的肉是怎么来的，从哪里来的，除了分配不公还有什么“猫儿腻”。他看到了，他骂娘，你就不能说他骂得毫无道理，纯属无理取闹。
    生气骂娘当然不好，不利于社会的安定团结。为了维护安定团结，我们常说的是要让群众理解改革中的困难，这是非常正确的。只是还需要补充一点，那就是为了达到这个目的，我们首先就要理解群众，理解那些生气骂娘的人为什么生气为什么骂娘。倾听他们的呼声，改进我们的工作，这样做才能真正为群众所理解，群众的气骂之声才能愈来愈少。
    对“患此气者”来说，最好听听谌容的劝告：“干吗生气呀？”光生气是没用的，应该把气化作改革的积极性，通过深化改革，兴利除弊，促使社会弊端早日得以革除，经济早日腾飞。这样，大家有了，自己也有了，便不会再“气人有”了。
