Recently, some law enforcement agencies and management departments in Xiangtan City have been creatively inventing reasons to arbitrarily impose fees, levies, and fines on individual businesses, causing great distress. Statistics show that these departments and units have imposed 48 different types of fees on individual businesses, of which only 16 are reasonable. The rest are largely unreasonable. For example, there are public security fees, meeting fees, health permit deposits, stamp fees, and front-door maintenance fees. Some health and epidemic prevention departments, in addition to charging individual businesses for health permits and health checks, also demand a health permit deposit of 50 yuan, a training fee of 5 yuan, and an on-site supervision and inspection fee of 30 yuan.

Duplicate charges are also common. For instance, health fees are collected by city management staff, urban management teams, and sanitation departments, ranging from a few tens of yuan to a few jiao. Meanwhile, some law enforcement departments and management agencies abuse their authority to arbitrarily impose levies and fines on individual businesses, with countless requests for sponsorships and donations. The Xiangtan North Road Market has over 700 individual businesses, and this year alone, they were forced to contribute over 50,000 yuan when renewing their licenses.

Due to the heavy burdens imposed by arbitrary fees, levies, and fines, over 3,300 individual businesses in the city have been forced to close. We urge relevant departments to manage the market according to the law and resolutely stop the practices of arbitrary fees, levies, and fines.

　　乱收费乱摊派乱罚款负担沉重
    湘潭市三千多个体户被迫歇业
    最近一个时期，湘潭市一些执法机关和管理部门巧立名目，自定标准乱收费、乱摊派、乱罚款，个体工商户叫苦不迭。据统计，这些部门和单位向个体户征收的费用有４８种，其中除１６种属于合理收费外，其余大多是不合理的。如治安费、会议费、卫生许可证押金、盖章费、门前三包费、治安押金，等等。有的卫生防疫部门除向办理卫生许可证的个体户收体检费、卫生许可证费外，还要收卫生许可证押金５０元，培训费５元，应邀现场监督监察费３０元。
    重复收费的现象也屡见不鲜。如征收卫生费，市管员收，城管队收，环卫处收，多则几十元，少则几角钱。同时，少数执法部门和管理机构还利用职权对个体户乱摊派、乱罚款，各种赞助、捐款数不胜数。市建设北路商场有７００多家个体工商户，今年更换执照时就被强行摊派了５万多元。
    由于乱收费、乱摊派、乱罚款给个体工商户带来了沉重负担，全市有３３００多家个体工商户因此而歇业。呼吁有关部门依法管理市场，坚决制止乱收费、乱摊派、乱罚款的现象。
