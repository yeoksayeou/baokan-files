Xinhua News Agency, Washington, April 12th.

President Bush today announced a comprehensive legislative plan to raise the ethical standards for U.S. government officials (including the executive, judicial, and legislative branches) and proposed reforms to campaign finance laws.

In discussing this plan with the American Society of Newspaper Editors, Bush said the aim is to elevate ethical standards in politics, prevent conflicts of interest between public service and private gain, and ensure that the law is respected both in fact and appearance.

The comprehensive plan includes a provision regarding the compensation and additional income of public officials. Bush proposed a 25% salary increase for judges and a pay raise for some executive branch officials, while simultaneously capping the amount judges can earn from additional income at 15% of their annual salary. The current regulation limiting additional income for executive officials to 15% of their annual salary will also apply to members of Congress and their senior aides.

Bush's proposed ethical standards for public officials also include the following main points: all public officials in the three branches of government must declare and have their financial sources reviewed in a uniform manner; the existing conflict of interest law will apply to officials and senior staff in Congress and the judiciary; further restrictions will be placed on lobbying activities by former officials; measures will be taken to prevent current officials from leaking official information; and public officials in the three branches of government will be prohibited from accepting personal gifts.

Regarding campaign finance reform, Bush advocates for the prohibition of all donations from political action committees, opposes federal funding for congressional elections, and seeks to repeal the provision allowing members of Congress elected before 1980 to convert remaining campaign funds for personal use upon retirement.

　　布什总统向国会提交
　　政府官员新道德标准法案
    本报华盛顿４月１２日电　记者张启昕报道：布什总统今天宣布美国政府（包括行政机关、法院和国会三大部门）从政道德标准的一揽子立法计划，并提出也要对竞选经费法进行改革。
    他在对美国报纸编辑协会谈到这项计划时说，计划的目的是提高从政道德标准，防止（公务与私利之间的）“利益冲突”，并保证法律在事实上和外表上都得到尊重。
    一揽子计划有一条规定涉及公职人员收取酬金或额外收入。布什提出给法官提高２５％年薪并给部分行政机关官员加薪，但同时限制法官收取酬金的数额不得超过年薪的１５％。对行政官员的额外收入不超过年薪１５％的现行规定，也将适用于国会议员及其高级助手。
    布什提出的从政道德标准还包括以下主要内容：即政府三大部门的公职人员都要以统一方式申报财源并加以审查；现行“利益冲突”法同样适用于国会和法院的官员及高级职员；进一步限制离职人员进行游说话动；防止在职人员泄漏公务情报；禁止政府三大部门的公职人员接受私人礼物。
    关于竞选经费改革，布什主张禁止政治行动委员会的一切捐赠，反对联邦为国会竞选提供经费，撤销１９８０年以前当选的议员在退休时把竞选经费余款转为私用的规定。
