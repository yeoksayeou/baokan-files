As an important aspect of modern politics, the issue of clean governance is a concern for governments worldwide. In the realm of building a clean government, some foreign countries have had relatively successful experiences worth learning from:

1. Establishing specialized anti-corruption and anti-bribery agencies. During periods when corruption was rampant, many countries and regions established specialized anti-corruption agencies, some of which are still effectively functioning today. In Asia, Singapore established the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau to specifically oversee government officials, emphasizing the separation of public and private interests and the separation of money and power, and strictly prohibiting any corrupt behavior.

2. Strict legal restrictions on officials engaging in business or holding additional jobs. Swedish law clearly stipulates that government officials are not allowed to engage in business. Citizens who were originally involved in commercial activities must completely sever ties with the business world before they can hold government positions. The French government prohibits civil servants from engaging in any profitable activities in their official capacity, from holding other paid public positions, and from taking on profitable private jobs.

3. Establishing property registration systems. To prevent public officials from using their power for personal gain and engaging in corruption, many countries require public officials to declare their assets and any changes to them before, during, and after their tenure. If a public official's standard of living exceeds what is appropriate for their official income and they cannot explain the source, they will face administrative penalties or legal sanctions. This is currently the most commonly used method abroad to combat corruption. In the United States, the "Ethics in Government Act" passed by Congress in 1978 applies to all officials in the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Mexico's Property Registration Law stipulates that federal officials must truthfully declare their personal property to the Federal Audit Department within 60 days of taking office, within 30 days of leaving office, and every May during their tenure.

4. Establishing a civil service system. The civil service system has a long history. In the 19th century, Britain significantly reduced corruption through measures such as competitive examinations for civil service positions and promotions based on performance. To this day, a sound civil service system continues to effectively ensure the integrity of Britain's civil service. In the West, Swiss civil servants are renowned for their law-abiding and honest conduct, which is directly related to the relatively sound civil service system in Switzerland.

　　国外有关廉政的若干做法
    作为现代政治的重要内容，廉政问题为各国政府所普遍关注。国外在廉政建设方面，有一些比较成功的经验值得借鉴：
    一、设立专门的反贪污反贿赂的廉政机构。一些国家和地区在贪污腐败现象最猖獗的时候，都曾设立了专门的廉政机构，有的至今仍在有效地行使职能。在亚洲，新加坡建立了反贪污调查局，专门用以监督政府官员，强调“公私分开”、“钱权分开”，不允许有任何贪污受贿行为。
    二、对官员经商或兼职活动有严格的法制限制。瑞典法律明确规定，政府官员不得经商。凡原从事商业活动的公民，必须与商界彻底脱钩后，方能在官府任职。法国政府禁止公务员以职业身份从事任何一项有利可图的活动，禁止公务员兼任有报酬的其他公职，也禁止他们兼任营利性的私人职务。
    三、建立财产登记制度。不少国家为杜绝公职人员以权谋私、贪污腐化，规定公职人员在任职前后和任职期间，必须向有关单位申报自己的财产及其变化情况。凡公职人员享有的生活高于官职收入相应的水平，而又无法解释其原因，都将受到行政处分或法律制裁。这是迄今为止国外对付贪污腐败现象最常用的手段。在美国，１９７８年国会通过的“申报财产真实情况法”，适用于立法、行政、司法三个部门的所有官员。墨西哥财产登记法规定，联邦官员应于上任后的６０天内，离任后的３０天内，以及在任期间的每年五月向联邦总审计部如实地申报个人财产。
    四、建立公务员制度。公务员制度由来已久。在１９世纪，英国曾用考试竞争公务员职务和按政绩提拔等措施大幅度减少了腐败现象。时至今日，健全的公务员制度仍然有效地保证英国文官队伍的清正廉洁。在西方，瑞士的公务员以遵纪守法、廉洁奉公而享有声誉，这同瑞士的公务员制度比较健全有着直接的关系。
