Xinhua News Agency, Paris, April 1st.

On March 31, the Eiffel Tower celebrated its 100th anniversary. This iron structure, affectionately known as the "Iron Lady" by the French, has indisputably become a symbol of France and a common language of world tourism. Over the past century, hundreds of millions of people have climbed the tower, a fact that the French take great pride in.

Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, under the supervision of the Paris Tower Management Company, a reenactment of the original event took place: a man dressed in a black suit, wearing a wide-brimmed hat, and holding a national flag, along with 30 other "notable figures" and "construction workers," ascended the tower in a grand procession. They climbed from the base to the first, second, and third levels, and finally to the fourth level where the television tower is located. They then hoisted the tricolor flag at the top. At this moment, 21 cannons roared, doves circled the tower, and colorful balloons floated into the sky. The words "100 years" illuminated by lights on the tower's body shone brightly and clearly. Countless tourists looked up to witness this scene. Perhaps this was even more magnificent than the ceremony a hundred years ago.

According to records, on March 31, 1889, at 1:00 PM, Gustave Eiffel, who led 250 workers to complete the tower in 27 months, also climbed the 1,710 steps to the third level during the inauguration ceremony. Amidst the roar of cannons, he proudly declared, "The French flag is finally flying on the world's tallest structure."

Time has passed, and the stars have shifted. This once-derided "monster" and "ugly iron framework" has proven that France "has not only entertainers who delight the masses but also excellent engineers and architects." It has been sung by countless novelists and poets, praised by singers, and depicted by painters. This "unprecedented iron tower" is undoubtedly a glory to Eiffel, a proud moment for Paris, and a monument to France's industrial revolution.

Over the past century, the Eiffel Tower has grown taller and heavier. Originally, it stood at 300.65 meters, but now, with the addition of radio and television antennas at the top, it has grown to 320.75 meters. Due to the installation of meteorological instruments, aviation navigation beacons, and three elevators at the top, its weight has increased from 7,300 tons to 9,000 tons.

The Eiffel Tower was built by the people of Paris to welcome the 1889 World's Fair and to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. In its first year, over 1.8 million people climbed to the top. In the past 30 years, the number of visitors has risen sharply, reaching over 4.7 million last year. On its 100th birthday, people wrote "Celebrating the Eiffel Tower's 100th Anniversary" in various languages (including Chinese) and hung them on the railings of the second-level platform to express their admiration. The Eiffel Tower has made significant contributions to France in both spirit and substance.

The reenactment on March 31 was just one of the activities for the 100th anniversary. According to reports, on June 17, during the 100th-anniversary celebrations, the Paris City Government will specially make a 25-meter-high, 20-meter-wide cake to celebrate the tower's 100th birthday. At that time, 800,000 people will gather around the tower and along the banks of the Seine River to enjoy the view and possibly share a piece of the cake. On that day, 300 invited singers from various countries will sing together for peace. One of the themes of the artistic performances will be to imagine how Parisians will celebrate the Eiffel Tower's 200th anniversary in 2089!

    在精神与物质上为法国作出贡献
    埃菲尔铁塔一百岁
    本报记者　张启华
    3月31日，埃菲尔铁塔整整100岁。这座被法国人爱称为“铁娘子”的钢铁建筑无可非议地成了“法国的象征”，“世界旅游的共同语言”。百年来，几亿人登塔的记录被法国人引为骄傲。
    昨天下午一时，在巴黎铁塔管理公司主持下，当年，埃菲尔率众登顶的“历史重现”了：身着黑色礼服、头戴宽边礼帽、手持国旗的“埃菲尔”和30名“知名人士”、“建筑工人”，在隆重的鼓乐声中，从塔底拾级而上，一层、二层、三层，直至电视塔上的第四层，然后把三色旗插上塔顶。这时，21响礼炮齐鸣，群鸽绕塔竞飞，彩色气球飘上蓝天。塔身上用灯管组成的“百年”大字更显得亮丽、晶莹。翘首的无数游客目睹了这一场面。也许这比百年前的典礼更为壮观。
    据记录，1889年3月31日下午1时，率领250名工人奋战27个月完成铁塔壮举的埃菲尔，也曾在竣工典礼上扛着国旗攀登1710个台阶到达三层平台。他在轰鸣的礼炮声中，自豪地说，法国国旗终于飘扬在世界最高的建筑物上。
    日月沧桑，斗转星移。正是这昔日被一些人斥为“无用”的“怪物”、“难看不起眼的铁架子”，证明了法国“不仅有娱悦大众的艺人，也有许多出色的工程师和建筑师”。它为无数的小说家、诗人所讴歌，为歌唱家所颂扬，为画家所描绘。这座“史无前例的铁塔”无疑是埃菲尔的光荣、巴黎誉满世界的盛景、法国工业革命的纪念碑。
    百年变化，埃菲尔铁塔既长高了，也增重了。当年落成时只有300.65米，如今因在顶上装上电台、电视台的天线而增高到320.75米，又因塔顶增设的气象仪器、航空导航航标、三架电梯等附属建筑，体重也从7300吨增加到9000吨。
    埃菲尔铁塔是巴黎人为迎接当年的国际博览会，也为法国国庆100周年而建的。建成的当年，就有180多万人登上塔顶。近30年来，参观人数直线上升，去年已达470多万人。在它百岁寿诞的昨天，人们用世界各国的文字（也包括中文）书写的“庆祝铁塔一百岁”的彩幅，张挂在二层平台的围栏上表示了世界各国观众对她的赞扬。埃菲尔铁塔在精神上、物质上给法国带来很大贡献。
    3月31日的“历史重现”只是百岁活动中的一项内容。据报道，今年6月17日百岁庆典时，巴黎市政府将特制一个高25米、边长20米的大蛋糕为百岁的铁塔祝寿。届时将有80万人站在铁塔周围、塞纳河两岸观光，并可能分享到一份蛋糕。这一天，应邀来自各国的300名歌唱家将一起歌唱和平。文艺表演的主题之一是试想巴黎人在2089年如何庆祝埃菲尔铁塔200岁！
