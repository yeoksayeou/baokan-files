Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 14th.

Three major leaders of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, where ethnic unrest has occurred, have all been relieved of their party positions. Givi Gombaridze, who has been the head of the republic's KGB for only two months and is 44 years old, has been nominated to replace Patiashvili as the first secretary of the republic's party central committee.

The Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, Grashimov, announced on the 14th at a press briefing: The Georgian party central committee plenary session held in Tbilisi agreed to Patiashvili's request to be relieved of his position as the first secretary of the Georgian party central committee. The plenary session also relieved Chairman of the Council of Ministers Chikheize and Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Cherkezishvili of their positions as members of the Georgian party central committee. They have also requested to be relieved of their positions in the government and the Supreme Soviet, and it is estimated that this request will be granted.

Grashimov said at a press conference held on the 13th that it was the republic's leaders who ordered the dispersal of the gathering in front of the Georgian government building on the night of the 8th, and "the responsibility lies with the republic's leaders."

Shevardnadze, a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union who was specially dispatched to Georgia to handle the ethnic unrest, attended today's plenary session and spoke.

　　格鲁吉亚三名主要领导人
　　被解除党内职务
    新华社莫斯科４月１４日电　据塔斯社报道，发生民族骚乱的苏联格鲁吉亚加盟共和国的３名主要领导人全部被解除了党内职务。担任共和国克格勃主席才两个月、４４岁的吉维·贡巴里泽被提名接替帕季阿什维利担任共和国党中央第一书记。
    苏联外交部新闻发言人格拉西莫夫１４日在吹风会上宣布：在第比利斯举行的格鲁吉亚党中央全会满足了帕季阿什维利关于解除他的格鲁吉亚党中央第一书记的请求。全会还解除了部长会议主席奇赫伊泽和最高苏维埃主席切尔克济亚的格鲁吉亚党中央常委职务。他们也请求解除在政府和最高苏维埃担任的职务，估计这一要求将会得到满足。
    格拉西莫夫曾在１３日举行的记者招待会上说，是共和国领导人下令驱散８日晚在格鲁吉亚政府大厦前的集会的，“责任在共和国领导人”。
    专程前往格鲁吉亚处理这次民族骚乱的苏共中央政治局委员谢瓦尔德纳泽出席了今天的全会，并讲了话。
