Stars from both sides of the Taiwan Strait will perform together from April 25 to 28 at the Exhibition Hall Theater in Beijing. The proceeds from the "Modern Stars" concert will be used to fund the travel expenses for Taiwan veterans residing on the mainland to return home to visit their families.

Xu Zhaolin, president of the Taiwan Veterans' Homecoming Promotion Association, said that there are still over a thousand Taiwan veterans on the mainland who have not been able to return to their hometowns to reunite with their families for over 40 years. Although the Taiwanese authorities now allow these veterans to apply to return home, they still face financial difficulties in covering the travel costs.

The concert is jointly organized by the All-China Taiwan Compatriots Association, China Central Television, and the China Daily. The aim is to raise funds for the veterans' travel expenses through the performances.

The Taiwanese stars participating in the concert include Pan Anbang, Bao Li, Gu Qihua, Tu Peizhen, and Lan Liting. The mainland stars include Hang Tianqi, Zhang Qiang, Fan Linlin, Wang Lan, Xie Jin, Wang Qiang, and Xing Lin.

　　两岸歌星今起为台籍老兵返乡义演
    新华社北京电（记者李大川）海峡两岸歌星从４月２５日起至２８日在北京展览馆剧场同台演出《现代之星》音乐会，其收入将用于居住在大陆的台湾省籍老兵回台探亲的旅费。
    台湾省籍老兵返乡探亲协进会会长徐兆麟说，目前在大陆的台籍老兵尚有一千多人，４０多年来未能回故乡与亲人团聚。目前台湾当局允许台籍老兵申请返台，但他们在返台经费上仍有一定困难。
    全国台联、中央电视台和《中国日报》联合举办《现代之星》音乐会，意在通过演出，为台籍老兵筹集旅费。
    据悉，参加这次演出的台湾歌星有：潘安邦、鲍立、顾其华、涂佩岑、兰丽婷；大陆歌星有杭天琪、张强、范琳琳、王兰、谢津、王强、邢林等。
