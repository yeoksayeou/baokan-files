Young gymnasts from both sides of the Taiwan Strait competed together today in the 1989 Asian Youth Gymnastics Championships. The Chinese men's team quickly secured two championships.

The People's Daily, Beijing, April 21st - Reporter Wang Dazhao reports: In today's afternoon session of the 1989 Asian Youth Gymnastics Championships, Chinese athletes demonstrated a significant advantage. They not only won the men's team championship and the top three spots in the men's all-around competition but also led in the first round of the rhythmic gymnastics team event and the all-around preliminary.

The top three teams in the men's team event were the Chinese team, the South Korean team, and the North Korean team. The top three individuals in the all-around competition were Chinese athletes Ma Jun, Nong Qiang, and Huang Huadong.

Although there were not many spectators in the Capital Gymnasium, the crowd was very interested in the Chinese Taipei gymnastics team, which was making its first appearance here. Cheerleaders frequently cheered for the athletes from both sides of the Taiwan Strait. Experts noticed that this new force in Asian sports had considerable strength, with almost everyone able to complete high-difficulty movements like the iron cross on the rings. However, their stability was not sufficient, and they lost to the North Korean team by a mere 0.15 points, failing to make it onto the men's team championship podium.

The athletes participating in this competition are all under 18 years old, and the outstanding ones among them are likely to be the new stars of the gymnastics competition in the next Olympic Games. Chinese athlete Guo Linyue's double backflip on the parallel bars and Ma Jun's front double flip to catch the high bar were both executed beautifully.

　　海峡两岸体操小将同场竞技    
    中国男队先夺两项冠军
    本报北京４月２１日讯  记者汪大昭报道：在今天下午开始的１９８９年亚洲青年体操锦标赛上，中国选手显示出很大优势，不仅获得了体操比赛男子团体冠军和个人全能前三名，在艺术体操第一轮团体赛和个人全能预赛中也遥遥领先。
    体操男子团体前三名依次为中国队、南朝鲜队和朝鲜队，个人全能前三名依次为中国选手马俊、农强和黄华东。
    尽管首都体育馆内观众不多，但对首次出现在这里的中国台北体操队仍然很感兴趣，拉拉队不时为海峡两岸选手同台角逐高声助威。行家们发现这支亚洲体坛新军有一定实力，几乎个个都能完成像吊环直角十字支撑这样的高难动作，只是稳定性不够，才以０．１５分的微小分差输给朝鲜队，没能登上男子团体赛的领奖台。
    参加这次比赛的都是１８岁以下的年轻运动员，其中的佼佼者很可能是下届奥运会体操比赛的生力军。中国选手国林跃的双杠空翻两周挂臂、马俊的单杠前空翻一周半越杠抓杠都做得很漂亮。
