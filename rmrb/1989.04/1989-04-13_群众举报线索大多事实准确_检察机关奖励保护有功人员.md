The Procuratorial Information Center of the Supreme People's Procuratorate has provided materials indicating that most of the tips reported by the public to procuratorial organs about crimes of embezzlement and bribery are factually accurate.

The Supreme People's Procuratorate has required all levels of procuratorial organs to improve their systems and continue to encourage the public to report, investigating and handling cases of officials violating the law and major cases.

It is reported that in the past year, among the more than 2,900 major cases of embezzlement and bribery investigated by procuratorial organs, more than half were initiated through reporting channels. Preliminary investigations have shown that among the 241 bureau-level and department-level cadres involved in reports, only 9.5% were found to have inaccurate tips or false reports. In the public reports, no cases of deliberate false accusations were found.

The head of the Procuratorial Information Center introduced that to protect the enthusiasm of the public for reporting, the Supreme People's Procuratorate has formulated several regulations for reporting work. Various levels of procuratorial organs have taken certain measures to reward informants who have made significant contributions.

Regarding incidents of retaliation against informants, procuratorial organs at various levels have conducted investigations and prosecutions in accordance with the law. It is known that in the past period, 11 provinces and municipalities, including Henan, Zhejiang, and Beijing, had more than 50 incidents of retaliation against informants. Procuratorial organs have seriously investigated and prosecuted cases that constitute crimes, arresting 7 people and releasing 1 person on bail. For other incidents of retaliation that do not constitute crimes, procuratorial organs have worked with relevant departments to handle them appropriately. This official emphasized that procuratorial organs will continue to improve certain systems to protect informants.

    新华社北京4月12日电  （实习生杨兴国）最高人民检察院举报中心提供的材料表明，群众向检察机关举报的贪污、受贿犯罪活动线索，大部分事实准确。
    最高人民检察院要求各级检察机关从健全制度入手，继续鼓励群众举报，查处干部违法案件和各种大案要案。
    据介绍，近一年来，检察机关立案侦查的2900多起贪污、受贿大案中，有半数以上是通过举报渠道立案的。经初步查明，在涉及到241名司局级干部的举报中，属于线索不准、举报不实的仅占9.5％。在群众举报中，没有发现有故意诬陷的。
    举报中心负责人介绍说，为保护群众举报积极性，最高人民检察院已制定举报工作若干规定，各级检察机关已采取一定措施奖励举报有功人员。
    对于打击报复举报人的事件，各级检察机关依法进行了查处。据悉，河南、浙江、北京等11个省市前一段发生打击报复举报人事件50多起。检察机关对构成犯罪的案件进行了认真查处，已逮捕7人，取保候审1人。对其他未构成犯罪的打击报复事件，检察机关也会同有关部门进行了妥善处理。这位负责人强调，检察机关还将完善一些制度，保护举报人员。
