The Third Repair Shop of the Beijing Capital Automobile Company has a suggestion book where customers leave their praise, as well as requests for "kickbacks" and "add-ons." Next to these requests, the shop manager has written: "Handle according to regulations, do not accept bribes."

The "regulations" mentioned in the manager's note are the rules established by Qin Youhai, the shop manager and Party Committee Secretary: rely on service and quality to win the trust of customers, and resolutely do not give gifts or kickbacks.

The shop was established in November 1984 by expanding a loss-making internal workshop. Qin Youhai was appointed as the manager. Everything was difficult at the beginning, especially attracting customers. By the spring of 1985, after the Chinese New Year, the shop was still empty and idle. Fierce competition lay ahead. There were more than 2,400 automobile repair units in Beijing, large and small. Many of these units, to attract business, gave drivers various benefits, such as commissions, kickbacks, and gifts. The gifts ranged from small items like sunglasses and lighters to large items like refrigerators and color TVs. This had become an open "secret" in the automobile repair industry.

Some people gave Qin Youhai similar advice. Qin Youhai said, "I am a Communist Party member and absolutely cannot go with the flow." He explained to the employees, "Giving gifts and kickbacks harms the country by putting state money into private pockets, harming the public and enriching the few. It also harms the customers because the quality of the repairs is not guaranteed; the car might break down again soon after being repaired. It corrupts the minds of the employees, who focus on crooked ways rather than service and quality. In the short term, this might attract customers, but it cannot last."

In a full-staff meeting, Qin Youhai announced, "I would rather starve than be corrupt!" Qin Youhai hung a large banner in the shop's courtyard that read, "Civilized, high-quality, timely service, sincerely serve the customers, and be fully responsible." He promoted this as the enterprise's spirit and culture. He required employees to establish correct business ideas and good business practices. He proposed four competitive strategies: first, prices should be low, earning only a small profit; second, quality should be superior; third, service attitudes should be good; fourth, repairs should be quick. He also formulated corresponding systems and measures.

Right prevails over wrong. Because Qin Youhai led the employees to resist corrupt business ideas, the entire shop maintained a spirit of hard work and progress. Although Qin Youhai was nearly sixty, often sick, and the shop had many cars, he always rode a bicycle to work. The employees also did not use customers' cars for personal matters. Many of the shop's equipment were built by the employees themselves, saving a lot of money.

The shop's employees not only do not give gifts or kickbacks to customers but also do not accept gifts from customers. Because of their enthusiastic service, some customers, out of gratitude, offered them money or gifts, which they all refused. A vehicle from a certain factory in Tianjin that could not be repaired in many places was repaired by them. The factory manager offered 150 yuan to the business employee, who refused. A vehicle from a certain unit of the Navy's aluminum products factory in Hebei's Huanghua County had a major traffic accident and was repaired by this shop. The shop immediately sent two workers, who repaired the car all night. The customer wanted to give each worker 20 yuan for their hard work, but the workers firmly refused. Last year alone, they sent workers to provide services dozens of times, as far as Shanxi and Inner Mongolia. They received dozens of letters of praise and more than ten banners of commendation.

This shop did not engage in corruption, and as a result, it did not suffer. Now it has signed repair contracts with more than 160 units nationwide. Previously, it was "desolate with few cars and horses," but now it is "cars flowing like water and horses like dragons." Some units originally signed repair contracts with this shop, but because they did not give gifts or kickbacks, the drivers took their cars to other places for repairs. After a period of comparison, they came back to sign contracts. They said, "Only here is the repair reliable." The shop's reputation is getting higher and higher, the business is getting more and more prosperous, and the economic benefits are getting better and better. In 1985, it made a pure profit of 1.59 million yuan, and in 1988, it was 3.2 million yuan. The shop was rated as a "double excellent" unit for "excellent repair and excellent management" by the Beijing Municipal Automobile Repair Management Office and was also rated as an advanced unit by the National Automobile Repair Industry Association. Shop manager Qin Youhai was named an outstanding Communist Party member by the Beijing Municipal Tourism Bureau for two consecutive years.

　　“宁饿不邪”   
    ——记共产党员秦友海
    李庆宇　史丽
    北京的首都汽车公司第三修理厂有个意见簿，上面有用户的表扬，也有“回扣”、“附加品”之类的要求。这些要求旁边是厂长批语：“按规定办，不可索物。”
    批语里的“规定”，就是这个厂的厂长兼党委书记秦友海给立的制度：靠服务、靠质量赢得用户的信任，坚决不送礼物、不给回扣。
    这个厂是１９８４年１１月由亏本的内部车间扩建起来的，秦友海出任厂长。万事开头难，最难的是没人来修车。１９８５年春节过了，厂子里仍然空空荡荡，闲得慌。激烈的竞争，摆在他们面前。仅北京就有大大小小的汽车修理单位２４００多家，不少单位为了招揽生意，给司机各种好处，让提成，给回扣，送礼物，小到墨镜、打火机，大到冰箱、彩电，花样迭出。这已是经营汽车修理行业公开的“秘密”了。
    于是，也有不少人给秦友海出这样的主意。秦友海说：“我是共产党员，绝不能随波逐流。”他掰着指头向职工讲解：“送礼、给回扣这一套，一害国家，使国家的钱入了私人的腰包，损公肥私；二害用户，修车质量没有保证，没准儿刚修完没几天就又坏了；三腐蚀人心，厂里的职工不在服务和质量上下功夫，净去搞歪门邪道了。从短时期看，也许能招徕用户，但肯定长不了。”他在全厂职工大会上宣布：“我是宁饿不邪！”
    秦友海在厂院里挂了一幅大标语，写着：“文明、优质、及时，真心为用户服务，竭尽全力负责到底。”秦友海把这作为企业精神、企业风气。他要求职工树立正确的经营思想和良好的经营作风。他提出四条竞争手段，第一是价格要廉，只赚薄利；第二是质量要优；第三是服务态度要好；第四是修车要快。同时制定了相应的制度和措施。
    正必压邪。由于秦友海带领职工从思想上抵制了腐朽的经营思想，使全厂职工精神面貌保持着一种艰苦创业、积极向上的劲头。秦友海虽年近花甲，多病，厂里汽车又比较多，但他长期都是骑车上班。厂里职工也没人擅自开用户的车办私事。这个厂很多设备都是职工自己因陋就简建起来的，节省了大量资金。
    这个厂的职工不仅不向用户送礼、给回扣，而且，也不接受用户的礼物。由于他们服务热情，有的用户出于感激之情，给他们送钱、送礼物，他们都拒绝。天津市某厂的一辆汽车在好多地方都修不好，他们给修好了，厂长送１５０元钱给业务员，业务员拒绝了。海军某部的铝制品厂的汽车在河北黄骅县发生了重大交通事故，找到了这个厂，厂里马上派了两名工人去，整整修了一夜，把车修好了。用户要给每人送２０元辛苦费，工人们坚决拒绝了。仅去年，他们就派人外出服务几十次，远至山西、内蒙古等地，收到用户表扬信几十封，锦旗十几面。
    这个厂没有“邪”，结果也没有“饿”。现在已经和全国１６０多个单位签订修车合同，昔日是“门前冷落车马稀”，如今是“车如流水马如龙”。有的单位本来是同这个厂签订了修车合同的，因为他们不送礼，不给回扣，司机就把车开到别的地方修理，经过一段时间比较，又来签订合同了。他们说：“还是这里修车可靠。”这个厂声誉越来越高，业务越来越红火，经济效益也越来越好。１９８５年获纯利１５９万元，１９８８年已经是３２０万元。厂子被北京市汽车修理管理处评为“优质修车、优质管理”的“双优”单位，还被评为全国汽车修理行业联合会的先进单位。厂长秦友海连续两年被北京市旅游局命名为优秀共产党员。
