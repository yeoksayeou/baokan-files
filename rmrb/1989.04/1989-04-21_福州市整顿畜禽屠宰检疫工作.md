	On September 17th of last year, your newspaper's fifth edition published a reader's letter titled "Fuzhou's Private Slaughterhouses Have Serious Meat Inspection Problems." After investigation, the situation was found to be true. In response, the municipal health department organized health supervision personnel to conduct inspections in various agricultural markets; established meat inspection points in 10 large and medium-sized markets; held training classes for meat inspection personnel; set up a hotline for reporting, formulated inspection work procedures, and required that pigs not be watered, dead pigs not be slaughtered indiscriminately, pig meat not be allowed to touch the ground, and uninspected meat not be allowed to leave the premises without a stamp of approval.

　　福州市整顿畜禽屠宰检疫工作
    去年９月１７日你报第五版刊登了《福州个体屠宰场肉检严重失控》的读者来信。经查，情况属实。为此，市卫生部门组织卫生监督人员深入各农贸市场检查；在１０个大中型市场设肉品检验点；举办肉检人员培训班；设举报电话，制订检验工作规程，并要求做到宰猪不灌水，不乱宰死猪，不准猪肉落地，不准未经检验盖章出场。
