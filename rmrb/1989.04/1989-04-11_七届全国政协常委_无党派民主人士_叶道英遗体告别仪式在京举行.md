Leaf Dao Ying was born in Meixian, Guangdong. He studied at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou and Shanghai University of Law and Politics. He served in various positions, including Commissioner of the Xiamen Salt Administration, Tax Commissioner of the Guangdong Provincial Finance Department, and Director of the General Affairs Department of the Shaoguan Match Monopoly Company. After the founding of the People's Republic, he served as a consultant to the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government, Deputy Director of the Guangdong Provincial Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission's Overseas Chinese Investment Guidance Office, and Consultant to the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. He was also the Deputy Manager of the Beijing Overseas Chinese Service Center, a State Council Consultant, and a member of the Standing Committee of the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh National Committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

Influenced by his elder brother, Leaf Jianying, Leaf Dao Ying pursued progress and sympathized with the revolution, making contributions within his capacity. During the Second Revolutionary Civil War, he risked his life to protect underground Communist Party members and used his position in the salt administration to mobilize salt merchants to transport large quantities of salt to the Soviet area, supporting the Red Army. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he actively worked for the resistance and national salvation, assisting in the rescue and protection of underground party members, helping the Eighth Route Army purchase weapons, and following the instructions of the Eighth Route Army to help patriotic youth from Nanyang and Guangdong to join the Communist Party in Yan'an. Before the liberation of the country, he accepted the instructions of Leaf Jianying and worked with the comrades of the South China Bureau of the Communist Party in Hong Kong. In the early days of liberation, he followed the party's instructions to establish the "Dadao Trading Company" in Guangzhou and Hong Kong, protecting underground party members and responsible for purchasing and transporting military supplies.

Leaf Dao Ying has always supported the Communist Party of China and the party's correct line and policies in various periods. During the Cultural Revolution, Leaf Dao Ying always stood on the side of the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries, opposing the wrongdoings of the Lin Biao and the Gang of Four. He cared about national affairs, actively participated in the activities of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and made many beneficial suggestions for the revitalization of China and the reunification of the motherland.
