People's Daily, Tokyo, April 11th - Correspondent Sun Dongmin reports: On the eve of Premier Li Peng's visit to Japan, the Japanese House of Representatives held a meeting today and unanimously passed the "Japan-China Investment Protection Agreement," which aims to promote Japanese corporate investment in China.

The China-Japan Investment Protection Agreement is an important agreement signed by the two governments after long-term negotiations. It was signed by Prime Minister Takeshita and Premier Li Peng during Takeshita's visit to China last year, representing the two governments.

This agreement stipulates that convenient and preferential treatment will be provided to Japanese enterprises investing in China, which is conducive to expanding investment in China. The agreement is valid for 10 years.

After the agreement was passed by the Japanese House of Representatives, it will be submitted to the House of Councillors for approval on the 12th and will come into effect one month later.
