Helplessly Watching the Flowers Fall
— South African President Botha Forced to Resign

	The 73-year-old South African President P.W. Botha, after ruling South Africa for a decade, suddenly suffered a stroke in January, leaving him partially paralyzed. After his condition improved, he attempted to return to his position, but faced a political storm demanding his graceful resignation. After a struggle, he was forced to announce on March 23 that he would step down from the presidency in October, handing over the position to the current chairman of the ruling National Party, F.W. de Klerk. The French newspaper Le Monde commented: "For this figure, plagued by illness and desperately clinging to his seat, this is a rather inglorious outcome. Whether he likes it or not, he has been forced out."

	On February 2, shortly after Botha's stroke left him incapacitated, National Education Minister de Klerk was elected chairman of the ruling National Party. On March 13, the National Party's decision-making committee held an emergency meeting, unanimously supporting de Klerk to take over Botha's presidential duties.

	Botha did not anticipate that his illness would lead to such serious political complications. When he sensed the situation was becoming dire, he announced, while still ill, that he would fully resume his presidential duties after Easter. This announcement failed to quell the strong opposition within and outside the party, leading him to announce on March 9 that he would advance his return to duty by two weeks, claiming he would complete his term as president according to the constitution.

	However, Botha's attempt to return to power backfired, with calls for his resignation growing louder. Senior National Party members and legislators expressed their support for de Klerk, urging Botha to step down gracefully. Former legislator Malan said, "Opposition to Botha has been brewing for years." A cabinet member stated, "We have given him the chance to step down gracefully, but if necessary, we can remove him within 48 hours. He must realize that his time has passed."

	Seeing the inevitable, Botha had no choice but to announce his resignation. An expert on South African affairs said, "Botha's stroke was an accident, but his resignation was inevitable."

	Botha took office in 1978. Over the past decade, he pushed South Africa's apartheid policy to its extreme. His forced resignation marks the beginning of the collapse of this policy. It indicates:

	— Botha has become an obstacle to South Africa's political reform. Botha has long been the supreme ruler of South Africa. Many legislators say he is a dictator within the party. Enlightened whites and the broader black population view Botha as the defender of apartheid and an obstacle to social change. His illness provided an opportunity for people to remove this political obstacle.

	— South Africa is in a state of internal and external turmoil. For a long time, Botha has implemented apartheid policies domestically and repeatedly invaded neighboring countries with military force, causing unrest in southern Africa. This has aroused widespread anger and international sanctions. South Africa's political situation is in turmoil, and its economy is deteriorating. Some forward-thinking members of the National Party have long wanted to change the president to resolve domestic racial conflicts and escape international isolation.

	— The rise of de Klerk and the fall of Botha reflect the will of the people. Soon after de Klerk was elected chairman of the National Party, the party's domestic policies began to show signs of change. It adopted a flexible attitude towards the hunger strike of imprisoned black freedom fighters, acknowledging that several major apartheid laws are obstacles to negotiations with blacks. In his parliamentary speech, de Klerk clearly stated: White rule must end, and a new South Africa without one race ruling another must be built; a new constitution should be drafted to allow all races to fully participate in governance, and the "Constitutional Development Plan" (achieving power-sharing through consultation) should be implemented.

	Botha's forced resignation means that the pillar of the apartheid system has collapsed. Regardless of who comes to power in the future, and no matter how much the extreme right resists, people will see that the struggle to completely change South Africa's apartheid system will continue to develop, and the eradication of this evil system is irreversible.

　　无可奈何花落去
　　——南非总统博塔被迫退位
　　关云秋
    现年七十三岁的南非总统博塔在统治南非十年之后，今年一月突然中风病倒偏瘫。病情好转之后，他力图重登宝座，不料却面临着要求他体面下台的政治冲击波。他经过一阵挣扎之后，于三月二十三日被迫宣布，将于今年十月把总统职位让给现任执政党国民党主席德克勒克。法国《世界报》评论道：“对于这位病魔缠身……悲怆地死死抓住自己的宝座不放的人物来说，这是不大光彩的结果，不管他愿意与否，他是被赶下台的。”
    博塔中风偏瘫退居二线后的二月二日，国民教育部长德克勒克当选执政党国民党主席，三月十三日，国民党的决策委员会召开紧急会议，一致支持德克勒克接替博塔的总统职务。
    博塔没有料到他的卧病会引来如此严重的政治并发症。当他预感到形势有些不妙时，曾抱病宣布，他将在四月复活节后全面恢复总统职务。他的这一宣布没能压住党内外的强烈反对，遂于三月九日宣布将复职日期提前两周，声称他将按宪法规定干完本届总统任期。
    可是，博塔的“回马枪”却适得其反，要求他引退的声浪日益高涨。国民党元老、议员们纷纷表态支持德克勒克，要求博塔体面引退，前议员马兰说：“反对博塔的情绪已经存在多年了。”一位内阁人士说：“我们给了他以体面下台的机会，但是，如果必要的话，我们可以在四十八小时之内把他打发走。他必须认识到，他的时代已经过去了。”
    眼见大势已去，博塔只好宣布让位。一位研究南非问题的专家说：“博塔中风是偶然的，博塔下台是必然的。”
    博塔是一九七八年上台的。十年来，他把南非的种族隔离政策推向了顶峰。他的被迫退位标志着这一政策开始破产。它说明：
    ——博塔已成为南非政治变革的障碍。博塔一直是南非至高无上的统治者。许多议员说，他是党内的独裁者。开明的白人和广大黑人都认为博塔是种族隔离政策的维护者和社会变革的绊脚石。博塔卧病不起为人们扔掉这具政治僵尸提供了机会。
    ——南非内外交困。博塔长期以来对内实行种族隔离政策，对外不断武装侵略邻国，使南部非洲不得安宁。这激起了天怒人怨和国际社会的制裁。南非政局动荡不已，经济每况愈下。国民党中一些有识之士早就想更换总统，以解决国内种族矛盾，摆脱国际上的孤立处境。
    ——德克勒克上台，博塔下野，反映了人心向背。德克勒克当选国民党主席伊始，该党的对内政策即有了变化的迹象。它在处理被关押黑人自由战士绝食斗争的问题上态度灵活，承认几个主要种族隔离法是同黑人谈判的障碍。德克勒克在议会的讲话中明确表示：白人统治必须结束，要建立没有一个种族统治另一个种族的新南非；制定新宪法，让各种族充分参加管理，实施“大英达巴计划”（通过协商实现各种族分享权力）。
    博塔被迫退位意味着种族隔离制度的支柱已经倾倒。未来不论谁上台，也不管极右分子如何负隅顽抗，人们都将看到，要求彻底改变南非种族隔离制度的斗争会进一步发展，根除这种丑恶的制度是不可逆转的。
