By the Yellow Sea, beside Shitou Port, there is a factory – the Shandong Province Rizhao City Five-Metal Machinery Factory. This collective enterprise with just over 600 employees is the designated factory for export products of the Shandong Province Machinery Import and Export Company and a major foreign exchange earner for Rizhao City.

Starting from 1958 during the "Great Leap Forward," Ma Chengxin has been in the factory for over 30 years. In this small factory that has changed names several times, he has served as a storage keeper, accountant, supply officer, and deputy director. In 1976, he was officially appointed as the director of the factory. However, until 1979, Ma Chengxin and all his workers were producing items like shovels, sickles, hoes, and pickaxes. The most advanced products were only small agricultural machinery parts.

This was not Ma Chengxin's intention.

Ma Chengxin was born into poverty but is a true Shandong man. Unfortunately, as the director, he was unlucky, and there was no place for a hero to show his prowess.

Ma Chengxin's aspiration was to run the factory in a way that would make it exemplary, to help the poor people in poor places become rich. In 1979, when the call for economic reform and opening up was made in China, Ma Chengxin seized the opportunity and led the Rizhao Five-Metal Machinery Factory onto the international market – they applied to produce and export American-style eight-sided hammers. The old factory buildings, primitive blacksmith furnaces, and outdated air hammers – could these really forge steel hammers to cross the sea? Several colleagues from the Shandong Province Machinery Import and Export Company came to inspect the factory and were convinced by the people but were greatly disappointed by the factory's equipment and technology. They wanted to see the samples as soon as possible. Ma Chengxin and his colleagues put in all their enthusiasm and wisdom and actually forged qualified samples, obtaining trial production qualifications. Over the years, they have produced eight types and more than 50 specifications of hammers, including eight-sided hammers and stonework hammers, which are sold to more than 30 countries and regions around the world.

Even small hammers for export have strict quality requirements, and there is no room for sentiment when dealing with foreigners. When they first produced export products, due to the key quenching technology not being up to standard, the product qualification rate was below 60% for a long time. The factory sent people to learn from other places, but no effective methods were found. Once, a regional engineer returned from an overseas inspection and talked about foreign quenching methods, which greatly inspired Ma Chengxin. He then focused his mind, repeatedly pondered, sketched diagrams, and experimented with everyone again and again, improving and developing a quenching machine that places hammers side by side horizontally and adjusts the quenching time through chains, spraying water from both ends – the "chain-type automatic water spray quenching machine." This invention increased the product qualification rate to over 98%, and two types of products obtained exemption from inspection qualifications.

Ma Chengxin is in his fifties, and his face always has a smile. Ma Chengxin knows that the road to truly freeing the Chinese people from poverty is still long.

　　锻得钢锤过海去
　　——记山东省日照市五金机械厂厂长马成训
　　本报记者　王黑均
    黄海之滨，石臼港侧，有家工厂——山东省日照市五金机械厂。这家职工不过600人的集体企业，却是山东省机械进出口公司出口产品定点厂，日照市的创汇大户。
    从1958年“大跃进”时入厂算起，马成训已有30多年厂龄了。在这个数易其名的小厂，他当过保管员、会计、司务长、副厂长。1976年被正式任命为该厂厂长。但是，直到1979年，马成训和他的全体工人们所干的活儿，就是生产些锨、镰、铲、锄之类，最尖端的产品也不过是些小农机配件而已。
    这可不是马成训的意愿。
    马成训出身贫寒，却是地道一条山东汉子。无奈当了厂长却时运不济，英雄无用武之地。
    马成训的意愿是办厂就办出个样儿，让穷地方穷人富起来。1979年中国经济改革开放的号角一响，马成训抓住机会，率先将日照五金机械厂领上了国际市场——他们申请生产出口产品美式八角锤。破旧的厂房，原始的铁匠炉，老掉牙的空气锤，就凭这些能锻得钢锤过海去？山东省机械进出口公司几位同志来厂考察，对人是信服的，对厂房设备技术却是大失所望。他们要尽快看样品。马成训和他的同事们用了全部的热情和才智，居然真地锻出了合格的样品，取得了试产资格。几年来，他们上了八角锤、石工锤等8个品种50多种规格的锤子，销往世界30多个国家和地区。
    小小锤子出口，质量要求苛刻，和外国人打交道，也没有情面可讲。他们生产出口产品之初，因关键的淬火技术不过关，产品合格率很长时间在60％以下。厂子曾派人去外地学习，也没找到有效方法。一次，地区一位工程师出国考察回来谈国外淬火方法，马成训大受启发。于是他潜下心来，反复琢磨，构思草图，和大家一次又一次试验，改进，研制出一种将锤子并排横放，通过链条移动调节淬火时间、两端同时喷水的淬火器——“链条式自动喷水淬火器”。这一发明使产品合格率提高到98％以上，还有两种产品获得免检资格。
    马成训50出头，脸上总是挂着微笑。马成训知道使中国老百姓真正摆脱贫困的路还长着呢！
