In mid-March, at the invitation of the Mongolian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the reporter visited the Mongolian People's Republic. Over the course of 10 days, interviews were conducted with leaders from various Mongolian departments and people from all walks of life. Factories, agricultural and pastoral cooperatives, schools, and other places were visited, providing a broad understanding of various aspects of the lives of the Mongolian people.

Mongolia's construction achievements left a deep impression on the visitors. After more than 60 years of effort, Mongolia has transformed from a backward nomadic region into a moderately developed country with a per capita national income exceeding $1,200. It has become a self-sufficient country in terms of food, a country with virtually no illiteracy, and a country where people value social ethics. According to the latest statistics, in 1989, the composition of national income was as follows: industry and mining accounted for 34.2%, agriculture and animal husbandry for 18.6%, and commerce and services for 27.5%. Over the past 20 years, Mongolia's industry and mining have developed rapidly, and the achievements in planting are obvious, but animal husbandry has stagnated, with the total number of livestock hovering around 23 million. Why has the traditional sector fallen behind? People believe that (1) the collectivization movement completed in the early 1960s and the long-term administrative command style in leadership work have harmed the enthusiasm of herdsmen for production; (2) the heavy export tasks often force cooperatives to slaughter livestock that do not meet standards, including breeding animals, affecting lamb production and reproduction.

The living standards of the Mongolian people are not low. In 1987, the per capita consumption of meat and meat products was 86.7 kilograms, and dairy products and dairy products were 113.6 kilograms. The monthly salary of state employees is 600 tugriks (Mongolian currency unit, 3 tugriks approximately equal to 1 US dollar). Urban residents mostly wear woolen coats, leather shoes, and fur hats, while the traditional long robes and felt boots of herdsmen are also of good quality; pure wool carpets and wall hangings are owned by many families. Of course, Mongolia's production of daily necessities is relatively backward, with 40% of daily necessities relying on imports, mainly from the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The long distance of transportation not only increases the price of goods but also makes it difficult to ensure normal supply. Deputy Mayor of Ulaanbaatar, Jadamba, said: Food and daily necessities are one of the difficulties faced by the municipal government. Chinese goods are rich and close at hand, and there has been a traditional connection in history, which is deeply desired by the Mongolian people. Rufsandorji, Director of the Economic Research Institute of the State Planning Commission, hopes that the next five-year plan can adjust the direction of export goods and expand commodity exchanges with China and Asian countries.

Reform is a hot topic in Mongolia. Last year was the first year Mongolia took steps towards reform. The Fifth Plenum of the 19th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party proposed reforms covering political, economic, social, and ideological aspects. In the political arena, emphasis is placed on the supremacy of the law, with party activities to be conducted within the framework of the state constitution; local people's congresses should truly enjoy their powers. The separation of party and government, and government and enterprises should be implemented, with party political leadership, and enterprises and mass organizations should independently carry out their work. Party democracy should be deepened, and the principle of democratic centralism should be implemented, with party elections adopting a system of competitive elections. The number of state ministries and bureaus has been reduced by approximately one-third.

In the economic sphere, a new planning system is being implemented, with the "State-Owned Enterprise Law" being enforced, requiring enterprises to implement full economic accounting, self-raising funds, and self-management; factory managers and directors are elected by workers through democratic elections, with workers' committees assisting the manager in managing the enterprise, and the manager being fully responsible for operational activities and final results. In agriculture and animal husbandry, the number of privately owned livestock is being expanded, and the lease and contract responsibility system is being promoted. Additionally, the state has promulgated the "Joint Venture Law" to encourage the inflow of foreign capital; the state has shifted from restricting to supporting individual labor and the development of labor cooperatives by citizens.

Of course, Mongolia's reforms have just begun, and many problems are still being explored. Mongolian comrades emphasize that reforms should be independently thought out and based on reality. People from all walks of life in Mongolia are very concerned about China's reforms and eager to directly understand China.

　　访问归来话蒙古
    本报记者  丹林
    ３月中旬，应蒙古外交部邀请，记者对蒙古人民共和国进行访问。１０天中专访了蒙古一些部门领导人和各界人士，参观了工厂、农牧合作社、学校等，广泛地接触了蒙古人民生活的各个方面。
    蒙古的建设成就给访问者留下深刻印象。经过６０多年的努力，蒙古由一个落后的游牧地区建设成一个人均国民收入超过１２００美元的中等发展中国家，成为一个粮食自给的国家，一个基本没有文盲、人民注重社会公德的国家。据最新的统计资料，１９８９年国民收入构成中，工矿业占３４．２％，农牧业占１８．６％，商业服务业占２７．５％。近２０多年来，蒙古工矿业发展迅速，种植业成绩明显，而畜牧业却停滞不前，存栏牲畜总在２３００万头左右徘徊。为什么传统部门落后呢？人们认为，（１）６０年代初完成的合作化运动及长期来领导工作中的行政命令方式伤害了牧民的生产积极性；（２）沉重的出口任务常迫使合作社宰杀未达标的牲畜、甚至母畜，影响了产羔与繁殖。
    蒙古人民的生活水平不低。１９８７年人均消费肉类及肉制品８６．７公斤，奶及奶制品１１３．６公斤。国家职工月工资６００图克里克（蒙古货币单位，官价３图约合１美元）。城镇居民大都穿着呢大衣、皮鞋、皮帽，牧民的传统长袍、毡靴质量也不错；纯毛地毯、壁毯为许多家庭所拥有。当然，蒙古日用消费品生产相对落后，４０％的生活必需品靠进口，主要来自苏联和东欧。遥远的运距，不仅提高了商品价格，也难以保证正常供应。乌兰巴托市副市长贾登巴说：食品与日用品是市政当局面临的难题之一。中国商品丰富，近在咫尺，历史上又有过传统的联系，深为蒙古群众所渴望。国家计委经济研究所所长鲁夫桑道尔吉希望下个五年计划能调整出口物资的流向，扩大与中国和亚洲国家的商品交换。
    改革，是蒙古当前的热门话题。去年，是蒙古迈出改革步伐的第一年。蒙党十九届五中全会提出的改革，涉及政治、经济、社会和意识形态等各个方面。在政治方面，强调法律的至高无上性，党的活动要置于国家宪法范围内；各级人民代表呼拉尔要真正享有权力。要使党政分开、政企分开，在党的政治领导下，政企单位、群众团体应独立地开展工作。要深化党内民主，贯彻民主集中制原则，党内选举要采取差额选举的办法。精简机构，国家部委局已减少约１／３。
    在经济方面，实行计划新体制，实行《国营企业法》，要求企业实行完全经济核算、自筹资金、自我管理；企业的厂长经理由职工民主选举产生，职工委员会协助厂长管理企业，厂长对经营活动及最后成果负全部责任。在农牧业中，扩大自留畜，推广租赁与承包方法。此外，国家还颁布《合营企业法》，鼓励外资流入；国家从限制转向支持公民从事个体劳动和发展劳动合作社。
    当然，蒙古的改革刚刚起步，许多问题尚在探索之中。蒙古同志强调，改革要独立思考，从实际出发。蒙古各界人士对中国的改革十分关注，渴望直接地了解中国。
