Reports from various newspapers in Mexico City today state that negotiations between Mexico and the international bank committee, composed of creditor banks, began on the 19th and have made initial progress by the evening of the 21st. The main agreements reached are as follows: the repayment of $1.175 billion in debt interest, which is due from July 1, 1989, to March 31, 1990 (the interest on loans Mexico took out from 1983 to 1984), will be postponed to the second quarter of 1990. This will alleviate Mexico's financial burden and reduce capital outflow for the current fiscal year. The validity period of the existing agreement with Mexico's external trade agency has been extended by half a year. In the coming months, credit support will continue to be provided for Mexico's foreign trade, particularly for essential imports.

　　国际银行同意墨延期偿还债利
    本报墨西哥城４月２２日电  记者郭伟成报道：墨西哥城各报今天报道说，墨西哥与债权银行组成的国际银行委员会进行的债务谈判从１９日开始，到２１日晚上已取得初步进展。双方达成的主要协议是，１９８９年７月１日到１９９０年３月３１日到期的债务利息１１．７５亿美元（即墨西哥１９８３年到１９８４年间借款利息）延期到１９９０年第二季度偿还，从而减轻了墨西哥本财政年度的付息压力与资金外流；同墨西哥银行外贸代理的原有协议有效期延长半年；在今后几个月中，继续对墨西哥的外贸、主要是必要的进口予以信贷支持。
