Title: The Three Joys of Life – A Sketch of Yu Junjian in 1988

His home is filled with books, paintings, and wine. He says that life has three joys: reading good books, making good friends, and drinking good wine. Therefore, he humorously refers to his humble abode as the "House of Three Joys."

In the "House of Three Joys," only the piano and a dozen cassette tapes with his portrait on them remind one that there is also singing here.

He says that his singing career was a "mistaken path." "By chance, I was selected by the Guilin Municipal Song and Dance Troupe, which changed my fate from going to the border of Guangxi to plant rubber trees and led me to where I am today."

He can write poetry, has excellent calligraphy, and paints beautiful large-scale freehand paintings. He has more friends in the literary and artistic circles than in the music world.

In 1981, he was transferred to the General Political Department Song and Dance Troupe. After analyzing the "giants" in the troupe (Li Shuangjiang, Kerimu, Cheng Zhi), he chose a path suitable for himself: combining the charm of ethnic music, the techniques of bel canto, and the expressive style of popular songs to create a new singing style. The facts have proven that he succeeded. Otherwise, how could he have recorded more than 20 cassette tapes and album collections, with a circulation of millions? How could he always be at the top of the list in every public evaluation activity? What is even more astonishing is that in his singing career, it is difficult to say which song he made popular, but he still has a large number of fans, and his popularity remains undiminished.

But it is this "unorthodox" path that has brought him many "disasters." Well-meaning people have summarized his journey as a "three-step process": when others ridicule him for only being able to sing on cassette tapes, he conquers one stage after another; when others mock him as a "vulgar singer," his name frequently appears on the list of "highbrow" events.

Facing the gains and losses of fame and fortune, if you ask him, he will surprisingly answer: "When I first stood in front of the Martyrs' Cemetery in Malipo, Yunnan, in 1982, I shed tears. A few years later, when I stood in front of this much more magnificent cemetery, I burst into tears. I will never forget that Mid-Autumn Night when I sent off the assault troops. Three young soldiers said to me, 'Brother Yu, when the war is over, we want to hear you sing in our hometown again.' But they never came back."

　　人生有三乐
　　——1988年金星郁钧剑素描
　　天足
    他家里书多，字画多，酒多。他说人生有三乐：读好书其一，交好友其二，喝好酒其三。因而戏称自己的陋室为“三乐居”。
    “三乐居”中只有那台钢琴和十几盒印有他头像的录音磁带，才使人恍然：这里还有歌声。
    他说他唱歌是“误入歧途”。“一个偶然的机会被桂林市文工团选中，从而改变了将去广西边境种橡胶的命运，并一直走到今天。”
    他能写诗，还能写一手好字，画颇有韵味的大写意。他在文学界、书画界的朋友比音乐界的多得多。
    1981年他调到总政歌舞团。分析了团里几座“大山”（李双江、克里木、程志）后，选择了一条适合于自己的路：把民族的韵味、美声的技巧和流行歌曲的表“情”方式结合起来，形成一种新的唱法。事实表明，他成功了。要不为什么他能录制20多个磁带和唱片专辑，发行数百万？要不为什么他能在每次群众评选活动中都名列前茅？尤其令人拍案叫绝的是，在他的演唱经历中，很难说清楚哪一首歌是他唱红的，但他照样拥有大量的歌迷，至今雄风不减当年。
    但也是这条“不正统”的路子，给他带来许多“灾难”。好心人为他总结出这样的“三步曲”：当别人讥笑他只能在磁带里唱歌时，他征服了一个个舞台；当别人嘲讽他是“下里巴人”时，他的名字却每每出现在“大雅之堂”的名单上。
    面对着名利得失，你问他，他会出人意料地回答：“当我1982年第一次站在云南麻栗坡烈士陵园前，我流泪了。数年后，当我再次站在这块比过去壮观多了的墓地时，我居然失声痛哭。我永远忘不了那个为突击部队送行的中秋之夜。三个小战士对我说，‘郁大哥，等将来打完仗了，我们想在家乡再听你唱歌。’可是他们却一去不回来了。”
