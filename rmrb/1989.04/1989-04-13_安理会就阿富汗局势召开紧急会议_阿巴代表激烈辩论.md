Xinhua News Agency, United Nations, April 11th.

The UN Security Council, at the request of the Kabul government, held an emergency meeting today. Representatives from the Kabul government and Pakistan engaged in heated debates over the current tense situation in Afghanistan.

Kabul government's Foreign Minister Wakil accused Pakistan of military aggression and interference in Afghanistan, seriously threatening Afghanistan's territorial integrity, independence, and security. He also demanded that the Security Council "take immediate action" to investigate Pakistan's actions.

Pakistan's Prime Minister's Advisor on Foreign Affairs and National Security, Agha Hu Shah, responded to Wakil's accusations point by point. He stated that the Kabul government's accusations against Pakistan were "groundless and fabricated."

The Security Council will continue its meeting tomorrow to hear statements from representatives of other countries.

    喀布尔政权外交部长瓦基勒指责巴基斯坦对阿富汗进行军事侵略和干涉，严重威胁阿富汗的领土完整、独立和安全。他并且要求安理会“迅速采取行动”，对巴基斯坦的行为进行核查。
