Premier Li Peng Visits Okayama and Fukuoka, Warmly Welcomed by Local People

Xinhua News Agency, Okayama, April 15 — (Reporter Zhang Keqi) Premier Li Peng arrived in Okayama Prefecture by plane this morning, leaving Tokyo. He visited the world-renowned Seto Ohashi Bridge and was warmly welcomed by people from various sectors of Okayama Prefecture.

Okayama Prefecture is located in the western part of Honshu Island, known as the "Chugoku region." It has had friendly exchanges with China since ancient times. Today, at noon, Okayama Prefecture, Okayama City, Kurashiki City, and the business community of Okayama held a grand banquet at the Jijima Hotel on the summit of Takashima Mountain, near the northern end of the Seto Ohashi Bridge, to welcome Premier Li Peng and his delegation.

Okayama Governor Nagano Shiro, on behalf of various sectors of Okayama, delivered a welcome speech at the banquet. He introduced the friendly exchanges that Okayama Prefecture has had with several Chinese cities, including Xi'an, Luoyang, and Nanchang, in recent years. He wished Premier Li Peng a successful visit to Japan.

Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, on behalf of Premier Li Peng, delivered a reply speech. He said, "Today, upon arriving at Okayama Airport, Premier Li Peng and his delegation immediately drove to visit the Seto Ohashi Bridge. This magnificent project has left a deep impression on us. Through their hard work, the diligent and wise people of Japan have built a bridge across the sea, connecting Shikoku with Honshu, finally turning a dream that has lasted for thousands of years into reality. This fully demonstrates that advanced science and technology, when used for peaceful construction, can create miracles and benefit humanity." He hoped that the friends from Okayama Prefecture would continue their efforts to build a bridge of friendship between China and Japan, as strong as the Seto Ohashi Bridge.

Both hosts and guests mentioned in their speeches the ancient figure Kibi no Makibi, who was born in Okayama Prefecture 1,200 years ago. He had traveled to the Tang Dynasty twice to study, making significant contributions to promoting friendly exchanges between ancient China and Japan and to the development of Japan. He is an outstanding figure in the 1,000-year history of Sino-Japanese friendship. Both hosts and guests expressed that this historical figure would inspire people to open up a more beautiful future for the relationship between the two countries.

More than 200 local people from various sectors, including Mayor Matsumoto Kazuyoshi of Okayama City, Mayor Takazawa Yoshio of Kurashiki City, and Chairman Ihara Kazuo of the Okayama Chamber of Commerce and Industry, attended the luncheon.

Mr. Okazaki Kabeita, a friend from Okayama Prefecture, also specially accompanied Premier Li Peng on the same flight to Okayama.

After the banquet, Premier Li Peng took a group photo with Chinese students and trainees in Okayama Prefecture.

Xinhua News Agency, Fukuoka, April 15 — (Reporter Zhang Keqi) Tonight, people from various sectors of Fukuoka Prefecture held a banquet to warmly welcome the friendly envoy from the neighboring country — Premier Li Peng and his delegation.

The banquet was held at the Hakata Shintani Hotel, where Li Peng and his delegation were staying. At around 7 p.m., the "Flying Hall" was brightly lit, with the national flags of China and Japan and a large Chinese banner reading "Warmly Welcome Premier Li Peng of the People's Republic of China and His Wife" hanging on the wall.

Fukuoka, formerly known as Hakata, is now the largest city and economic center in the Kyushu region. It is separated from the Chinese mainland by only a sea, and it has been a gateway for Japan's foreign exchanges since ancient times. The history of friendly exchanges between Fukuoka and China can be traced back to the Eastern Han Dynasty 2,000 years ago.

Fukuoka Governor Ota Hachiji, on behalf of various sectors, delivered a speech at the dinner. He said, "Kyushu is very close to China. In the more than 2,000-year history of exchanges between Japan and China, Kyushu, as a window, has played an important role in Japanese history. Now, many places in Fukuoka Prefecture and the Kyushu region have established sister city relationships with China, and exchanges in economics, academia, and culture have become increasingly frequent. The foundation for exchanges between China and Fukuoka Prefecture has been laid, which is a very joyful thing for the people of Fukuoka Prefecture who eagerly hope to expand and develop friendly relations with China."

Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, on behalf of Premier Li Peng, delivered a speech at the banquet. He said, "Kyushu is separated from China by only a sea. In the long history of friendly exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan, Fukuoka and the Kyushu region occupy a very important position. After the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan, the friendly exchanges between Fukuoka and the Kyushu region with China have continued to develop, and economic and trade exchanges have become increasingly active."

Foreign Minister Qian also introduced to the host the activities of Li Peng and his delegation in Tokyo. He said, "The content of this visit is rich, and the progress is smooth. It has enhanced mutual understanding and friendship between China and Japan, playing an important role in promoting the healthy development of relations between the two countries."

Ten organizations jointly hosted tonight's welcome banquet: Fukuoka Prefecture, Fukuoka City, Kitakyushu City, Omuta City, Kurume City, Kyushu-Yamaguchi Economic Federation, Fukuoka Economic Friendship Association, Fukuoka Chamber of Commerce and Industry Federation, Fukuoka Prefecture Japan-China Friendship Association, and West Japan Japan-China Trade Center.

Approximately 150 representatives from Nagasaki Prefecture, Saga Prefecture, and Oita Prefecture, as well as representatives from various sectors, attended the dinner.

China's Consul General Guo Zhu and Consul General Yan Wenyong from the Consulate General in Nagasaki were also invited to attend the banquet.

Premier Li Peng and his entourage arrived in Fukuoka this afternoon by Shinkansen high-speed train from Okayama. They were warmly welcomed by Fukuoka Governor Ota Hachiji and hundreds of local people at the station platform.
