　　社会活动所有领域都需改革
    新华社莫斯科４月１８日电　苏共中央总书记戈尔巴乔夫今天上午会见捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央总书记雅克什时，强调了变革的迫切性。他指出，在社会活动的所有领域都迫切需要变革。但也有许多人习惯于一定的秩序，不坚定地，有时甚至提心吊胆地对待变革。
    雅克什是在捷国内要求改革的呼声日益高涨的情况下前来苏联进行工作访问的。戈尔巴乔夫同他就改革问题交换了意见。会见中，戈尔巴乔夫强调，改革最困难的是克服原有思维的惰性和停滞时期产生的习惯。雅克什介绍了捷准备进行政治体制改革的计划，并且强调克服管理的行政命令形式并非易事。
    在谈到社会主义发展问题时，戈尔巴乔夫说，每个国家的特殊情况要求在变革速度方面有所差别。与此同时，戈尔巴乔夫还强调说，必须不断前进，不要落在社会需求和人民群众情绪的后面。
    雅克什已于今天结束了对苏联的访问。
