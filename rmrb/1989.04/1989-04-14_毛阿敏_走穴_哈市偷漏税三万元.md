Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, April 14th.

Singer Mao Aimin performed in Harbin during the Spring Festival, earning 600,000 yuan in five days but evading 300,000 yuan in personal income adjustment tax.

The Harbin *Life Daily* reported that to organize the Spring Festival Swan Dance Music Concert, the host, Harbin Black Swan Hotel, initially invited Mao Aimin to perform 15 shows for 350,000 yuan in cash in Beijing. The agreement was made without any receipts, following Mao's instructions. Later, they promoted the event in Harbin. When everything was ready for the performance, Mao's fiancé and agent, Zhang Yong, suddenly demanded an additional 250,000 yuan in performance fees on behalf of Mao Aimin, threatening to cancel the agreed "contract" if the demand was not met.

The Black Swan Hotel was caught off guard and, despite some negotiation, ultimately agreed to the additional fee due to the extensive advertising already done and the need to avoid disappointing the audience. Thus, Mao Aimin received another 250,000 yuan, again without any receipts. After much trouble, Mao Aimin finally performed in Harbin on the first day of the Lunar New Year. On the fifth day of the Lunar New Year, when the host proposed tax payment matters and informed the tax authorities of the upcoming tax collection, Mao and Zhang left Harbin in the middle of the night, claiming they had to rush to Dalian for another performance. They evaded paying 300,000 yuan in personal income adjustment tax after performing only 12 out of the agreed 15 shows.

The manager of the Black Swan Hotel said, "We spent months organizing this concert, inviting various singers, but we only received 800,000 yuan in box office revenue, and Mao Aimin alone took away 600,000 yuan. Some of her actions were akin to extortion, which is truly infuriating."

### 毛阿敏“走穴”哈市偷漏税三万元

　　毛阿敏“走穴”哈市偷漏税三万元
    据中新社哈尔滨电　歌星毛阿敏春节来哈“走穴”，五天获利六万元，却偷漏个人调节税三万多元。
    哈尔滨《生活报》报道说，为组织好春节天鹅展姿音乐会，主办单位哈尔滨黑天鹅大酒家先是在北京以现金３．５万元，演出１５场的价码将毛阿敏请出，并遵毛的意见未开任何收款字据；尔后又在哈市做广告。当一切就绪，只等演出时，毛的未婚夫兼代理人张勇突然代表毛阿敏，提出须再加２．５万元的演出费，否则将取消既定“协议”。
    黑天鹅大酒家一时措手不及，虽也讨价还价，但终因广告已做，如晚会泡汤不好向观众交待等原因而忍痛同意。这样，毛阿敏又拿到２．５万元，依然是未开任何收款字据。几经周折，毛阿敏终在大年初一与哈市观众见面。正月初五，当主办单位向毛阿敏提出缴税事宜，亦告知税务部门要来征税时，毛、张二人在只演完十二场的情况下，以急于赶赴大连演出为由漏夜启程离哈，偷漏个人收入调节税三万多元。
    黑天鹅大酒家经理说，为一台晚会，忙乎了几个月，费好大劲才请来各路歌星，可我们拿到的票房收入８万多元，毛阿敏一人就拿走６万元。有些做法近乎敲诈，实在令人气愤。
