Recently, there have been widespread rumors that Xie Jin is planning to film "The Biography of Jiang Qing." In response, Xie Jin has explicitly stated that this is not the case. Xie Jin said that it is impossible to film Jiang Qing's entire life into a movie. However, he had once considered the idea that if certain activities from a specific period of Jiang Qing's life were selected and brought to the screen, it could reflect the historical landscape of that era from a particular angle, providing some reflection for the audience. But it would definitely not be "The Biography of Jiang Qing." This was just a conceptual idea.

　　盛传谢晋将拍《江青传》
　　谢晋说并无此事
    本报讯　近日外界盛传谢晋将拍《江青传》，为此，谢晋明确表示并无此事。谢晋说，要把江青几十年来的生活拍成电影是不可能的。但他曾有过构想，如果摘取江青在某阶段的一些活动，搬上银幕，那也可以从一个侧面深刻地反映这一个时期的历史面貌，对人们会有一定的反思作用。但也绝不是《江青传》。这只是一种构想而已。
