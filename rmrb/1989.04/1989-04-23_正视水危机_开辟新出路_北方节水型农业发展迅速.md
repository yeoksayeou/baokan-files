Facing the Water Crisis and Paving New Paths
Northern China's Rapid Development of Water-Saving Agriculture

Reporters recently learned from a water-saving agriculture symposium held by the Ministry of Water Resources that in recent years, water-saving agriculture in northern China has developed rapidly. The application of water-saving technologies such as anti-seepage canals, pipeline water delivery, and sprinkler and drip irrigation has reached 55.5 million acres, accounting for more than one-third of the total irrigated area.

Since the 1980s, northern China has experienced consecutive droughts, reduced rainfall, and excessive groundwater extraction. The water crisis has seriously affected agricultural production. On the other hand, some areas have uneven land and use flood irrigation, resulting in significant water waste. It is understood that the water utilization rate in large irrigation areas is only 30% to 40%.

The adoption of water-saving technologies can save an average of 50 cubic meters of water per acre. Calculating that 1 cubic meter of water increases grain production by 0.75 kilograms, a total of 2.25 billion kilograms of grain can be increased.

Relevant officials from the Ministry of Water Resources stated that water-saving technologies should be promoted as an important part of agricultural modernization. They aim to achieve water-saving irrigation for 100 million acres by the year 2000.

　　正视水危机　开辟新出路    
    北方节水型农业发展迅速
    本报北京４月２３日讯  记者最近从水利部召开的节水型农业座谈会上了解到，近几年，我国北方节水型农业的发展迅速，采用防渗渠道、管道输水和喷滴灌等节水技术灌溉面积已达５５５０万亩，占总灌溉面积的１／３以上。
    进入８０年代以来，我国北方连续干旱，降雨量减少，地下水超量开采。水的危机已严重地影响到农业生产。但另一方面，农田灌溉时有的地方不平整土地，大水漫灌，浪费又十分严重。据了解，大型灌区水的利用率只有３０％—４０％。
    采用节水技术，平均每亩地可节水５０立方米，１立方米增粮０．７５公斤计算，总共可增产粮食２２．５亿公斤。
    水利部有关负责人表示，要把节水技术作为科技兴农的一项重要内容加紧推广，力争在２０００年以前，实现节水灌溉１亿亩。
