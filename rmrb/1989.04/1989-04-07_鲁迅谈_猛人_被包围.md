Lu Xun said that his essays are not easily understood by young people with limited experience. But he also placed China's hope in the youth—although "youth cannot be generalized." This discusses a political puzzle left by Lu Xun for patriotic heroes and young friends. Lu Xun said that if this problem is solved, "China would be saved by half." Now is the time to solve it—if reform cannot solve this problem, reform is not in vain, but at least it is half-wasted.

This problem was posed in 1927 in "Threading Needles." Lu Xun wrote: In China, no matter who the person is, once they become a hero (this was a common term in Guangzhou at the time, which could include celebrities, capable people, and wealthy people), regardless of the size of their "heroism," they will be surrounded by a group of people, surrounded tightly. The result is that, internally, it makes the hero gradually become foolish, tending towards being a puppet. Externally, it makes others see not the true face of the hero, but a distorted image presented by the surrounding people. If we have a chance to accidentally walk near a hero, we can see that the faces and actions of the surrounding people at this time are very different from when they deal with others. We see a hero's confidant, arrogant and unreasonable, and easily think that the hero likes such people. But in fact, it is completely wrong. The hero sees him as gentle and honest, very lovable, even stuttering when speaking and blushing when talking... He said, those who know a bit of Beijing history should still remember the time when Yuan Shikai became emperor. To read the newspaper, the surrounding people would even print special editions for him to read, with public opinion fully supporting and public opinion unanimously agreeing. It was not until Cai E's Yunnan uprising that he suddenly exclaimed and ate more than twenty steamed buns without knowing it. But this play also ended, and Yuan Shikai ascended to heaven. The surrounding people then left this fallen big tree and went to seek another new hero.

Therefore, Lu Xun once wanted to write an essay "New Theory on Surrounding," first describing the methods of surrounding, then discussing why China always takes the old road, the reason being that the hero, although there are rises and falls, the surrounding people are always the same group. Next, he further discussed that if the hero could break away from the surrounding, China would be saved by half. The conclusion is the method of breaking away from the surrounding.—But he finally did not come up with a good method, so this new theory has not been started. Lu Xun is not a saint, but a true seeker of truth, who does not write if he cannot think of a solution. Therefore, he sincerely requests that "patriotic heroes and revolutionary youth not consider me lazy in planning, only listing the contents without the article. I am thinking, and I have thought of two methods, but after repeated consideration, they are useless. One is for the hero to go out and see the situation outside, not to 'clear the way' first. However, even without 'clearing the way,' everyone encounters a hero and will generally change their natural state, and the true appearance can no longer be seen. Two is to widely accept various types of people, not to be surrounded by a certain group of people. However, after a long time, there will still be a group that prevails, and the surrounding power of the final winner is the strongest, and in the end, it is still the old fate: ascending to heaven."

Mao Zedong highly praised Lu Xun, and in "On New Democracy" he used seven "mosts" to describe Lu Xun. He wanted to use his practice and theory to write the article that Lu Xun could not complete. He said he finally found the method to solve this problem, which is the "Great Democracy" of the Cultural Revolution. But this "Great Democracy" is actually just a "revolution by decree," and the target of the revolution must first be found by his "keen insight," then indicated by his confidants, and the little generals will go and pull them out, otherwise, those who fired cannons at the "headquarters of the proletarian revolution" would commit a great crime. It can be seen that it is still the old tune, but it has been circled around a "Great Democracy," and the result is known to all.

The pendulum swings to the extreme, and China's reform began in the desperate situation after the Cultural Revolution. The painful lessons and reform have opened up new ideas and prospects for us to solve this problem. The solution to this problem cannot always be on the "hero," but to establish an effective democratic and scientific decision-making and supervision system. This requires a fundamental reform of the traditional social and political structure of "patriarchal rule" and "one-man rule," to recognize the basic democratic rights of the people, to establish and improve the people's representative system based on universal suffrage, to make democracy institutionalized and legalized. At the same time, to give full play to the increasingly important role of press freedom and academic democracy in modern society's democratic supervision and decision-making process, so as to gradually realize the transition from traditional personal charisma authority to social legal authority, so that the people truly gain democracy, and also make the "hero" get rid of the fate of being surrounded, making the clever people who are good at surrounding have no way to show their tricks. This is, of course, not necessarily a foolproof plan.

### 鲁迅谈“猛人”被包围

　　鲁迅谈“猛人”被包围
　　张琢
    鲁迅说，他的杂文，阅历尚浅的青年是不大容易读懂的。但他又将中国的希望寄托于青年——虽然“青年也不能一概而论”。这里谈的就是鲁迅留给爱国志士和青年朋友们的一道政治难题。鲁迅说这个问题解决了，“中国就有五成得救”。现在是到了索解的时候了——如果改革不能解决这个问题，改革不是白费，至少也是半废。
    这道题出在１９２７年写的《扣丝杂感》中。鲁迅写道：在中国，无论是何样人，一成为猛人（这是当时广州的常用话，其中可以包括名人、能人、阔人三种），则不问其“猛”之大小，他的身边便有几个包围的人们，围得水泄不透。那结果，在内，是使该猛人逐渐变成昏庸，有近乎傀儡的趋势。在外，是使别人所看见的并非该猛人的本相，而是经过了包围者的曲折而显现的幻形。假如我们能有一种机会，偶然走到一个猛人的近旁，便可以看见这时包围者的脸面和言动，和对付别的人们的时候有怎样地不同。我们在外面看见一个猛人的亲信，谬妄骄恣，很容易以为该猛人所爱的是这样的人物。殊不知其实是大谬不然的。猛人所看见的他娇嫩老实，非常可爱，简直说话会口吃，谈天要脸红……他说，凡知道一点北京掌故的，该还记得袁世凯做皇帝时候的事罢。要看日报，包围者连报纸都会特印了给他看，民意全部拥戴，舆论一致赞成。直要待到蔡松坡云南起义，这才阿呀一声，连一气吃了二十多个馒头自己都不知道。但这一出戏也就闭幕，袁公的龙驭上宾于天了。包围者便离开了这一株已倒的大树，去寻求别一个新猛人。
    因此，鲁迅曾想做一篇《包围新论》，先述包围之方法，次论中国之所以永是走老路，原因即在包围，因为猛人虽有起仆兴亡，而包围者永是这一伙。次更论猛人倘能脱离包围，中国就有五成得救。结末是包围脱离法。——然而终于想不出好的方法来，所以这新论也还没有敢动笔。鲁迅不是圣人，而是一位真正实事求是的思想家，想不出来就不硬写。所以他恳请“爱国志士和革命青年幸勿以我为懒于筹画，只开目录而没有文章。我思索是也在思索的，曾经想到了两样法子，但反复一想，都无用。一，是猛人自己出去看看外面的情形，不要先‘清道’。然而虽不‘清道’，大家一遇猛人，大抵也会先就改变了本然的情形，再也看不出真模样。二，是广接各样的人物，不为一定的若干人所包围。然而久而久之，也终于有一群制胜，而这最后胜利者的包围力则最强大，归根结蒂，也还是古已有之的运命：龙驭上宾于天。”（《鲁迅全集》第３卷，第４８６—４８８页）
    毛泽东是十分称道鲁迅的，他在《新民主主义论》中就一气用了七个“最”来形容鲁迅。他要用自己的实践和理论来写出鲁迅未能做出的文章。他说他终于找到了解决这一问题的方法，那就是“文化大革命”的“大民主”。但这“大民主”其实不过是“奉旨革命”，革的对象先得靠他“明察秋毫”察出来，然后通过亲信示意，由小将们去揪出来，否则，炮打了“无产阶级司令部”的人，便要闯下大祸。可见还是老谱，不过枉然绕了一个“大民主”的弯子，那结局是大家都看到了的。
    物反于极，中国的改革正是在“文化革命”后的绝境中开始的。痛苦的教训和改革为我们索解这道难题打开了新的思路和前景。这个问题的解决不能老是在“猛人”身上打主意，而要建立起有效的民主和科学的决策和监督制度。这就要根本改革“家长制”和“一言堂”的传统社会政治结构，确认人民的基本民主权利，建立和健全普选基础上的人民代表制度，使民主制度化、法制化。同时，发挥新闻自由和学术民主在现代社会民主监督和决策过程中所具有的越来越重要的作用，从而逐步实现从传统的个人感召权威向社会法理权威的过渡，使人民真正获得民主，也使“猛人”摆脱被包围的厄运，使善包围的乖角儿无以施其伎。这当然不一定就是万全之计。
