Gorbachev Delivers Speech in Cuba
Opposes Exporting Revolution and Counter-Revolution
Proposes Denuclearization in Latin America
Calls for Ending the Cold War Era

According to Xinhua News Agency in Havana on April 4, Soviet leader Gorbachev called for an end to the export of "revolution and counter-revolution" to Central America, stating that Soviet-Cuban relations are not affected by changes in the global landscape.

Gorbachev believes that there is a real possibility to resolve the conflicts in Central America. He demands a halt to the supply of weapons to all parties involved in the Central American conflict, regardless of the source. He expressed that the Soviet Union opposes the "export of revolution and counter-revolution" to this region.

Gorbachev made these remarks today in a speech at the National Assembly of People's Power in Cuba.

He pointed out that the Central American crisis "should be resolved by Latin American countries without external interference," and noted that the peace agreements reached by the five countries in the region have laid a good foundation for achieving peace. Gorbachev criticized the United States' tendency to adopt a "hegemonic attitude" on the Central American issue, and said that the realization of peace in Central America also depends on the attitudes of Nicaragua's neighboring countries.

In his speech, Gorbachev proposed denuclearization in Latin America and expressed his willingness to attend an international conference to discuss this issue. He also solemnly declared that the Soviet Union has no intention of introducing missiles, military bases, or weapons of mass destruction into Latin America.

The leaders of the two countries also signed a 25-year friendship treaty today.

Xinhua News Agency in Havana on April 4 reported that Soviet leader Gorbachev said at a press conference held today at the Conference Hall in Havana that the world today is tired of confrontation, and both the entire world and socialist countries are at a turning point in history.

He believes that the era of power politics is discredited, and therefore "we should end this Cold War era and usher in a new era." Gorbachev also emphasized the necessity of restructuring the overall system of international relations in his speech at the National Assembly of People's Power in Cuba on April 4.

　　戈尔巴乔夫在古巴发表演说
    反对输出革命和反革命
    建议在拉美实行非核化
    表示应该结束冷战时期
    据新华社哈瓦那４月４日电  苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫呼吁停止向中美洲输出“革命和反革命”，指出苏古关系不受世界格局变化的影响。
    戈尔巴乔夫认为当前出现了解决中美洲冲突的切实可能性。他要求停止向中美洲冲突的各方提供武器，无论这些武器来自何方。他表示苏反对向这个地区“输出革命和反革命”。
    戈尔巴乔夫是今天下午在古巴全国人民政权代表大会上发表演说时作上述表示的。
    他指出，中美洲危机“应在没有外来干涉的情况下由拉美国家来解决”，并指出，中美洲５国达成的和平协议为实现该地区和平“奠定了良好的基础”。戈尔巴乔夫指责美国在中美洲问题上倾向于采取“强权态度”，并说，能否在中美洲实现和平也取决于尼加拉瓜的邻国所采取的态度。
    戈尔巴乔夫在讲话中建议在拉美实行非核化，并表示他愿意出席为讨论这个问题而召开的国际性会议。他还郑重声明，苏联无意把火箭、军事基地或毁灭性杀人武器引进拉丁美洲。
    两国领导人今天还签署了一项有效期为２５年的古苏友好条约。
    新华社哈瓦那４月４日电 苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫今天在哈瓦那会议大厦举行的记者招待会上说，当今的世界已经对对抗感到厌倦，无论整个世界还是社会主义国家都正处于一个转折的时代。
    他认为强权政治已经名声扫地，为此“我们应结束这一冷战时期和开创一个新时代。”戈尔巴乔夫４日在古巴全国人民政权代表大会演讲中还特别强调了重新安排国际关系总体系的必要性。
