Over 30,000 excellent books gathered in Tianjin
Tianjin holds the second Sea River Spring Book Fair

According to a report, last winter and this spring, the domestic book market experienced a significant downturn due to various reasons, causing concern in the publishing and distribution industries. The publication of Jia Lusheng's reportage "The Second Channel" sparked different reactions among publishing and distribution professionals as well as readers. The nuances of right and wrong cannot be summarized in a few words. However, one thing is clear: the "vicious cycle" of difficulties in submitting manuscripts, publishing books, buying books, and selling books persists and shows signs of worsening.

Over the past few years, the Tianjin New China Bookstore has been exploring reforms in the main channel distribution system: In September 1986, it was the first in the national New China Bookstore system to establish a business development department, making information capture and processing systematic and effective; introducing a risk management mechanism to create new productive forces, adding vitality to the main channel's operating mechanism; to adapt to the increasingly fierce competition and changes in the book market, at the beginning of this year, the Tianjin New China Bookstore decided to establish the Tianjin Book Trade Company. The company integrates the business development department, business department, wholesale bookstore, audio-visual bookstore, reference bookstore, and Tianjin's largest sales bookstore—Dongbei Jiao Bookstore, forming a cohesive economic entity with coordinated internal forces. This is a bold attempt by the store itself to transition from a management-oriented to a service-oriented approach, and it is another pioneering reform step in the national bookstore system; at the same time, various district bookstores and specialized bookstores in Tianjin, due to the delegation of "three golds" and term-target management, have given the grassroots more autonomy, further mobilizing the enthusiasm of cadres and staff.

To verify the results of the reform, demonstrate the strength of the main channel, and play the role of the main channel, the Tianjin New China Bookstore, despite the fierce competition in the book market and severe lack of funds, resolutely decided to hold the second Sea River Spring Book Fair from mid-April to early May at the Tianjin Industrial Exhibition Hall. This fair prioritizes social benefits, providing a large number of excellent books to readers.

Over the past two months, the Tianjin New China Bookstore has dispatched a large number of business personnel to organize a large number of high-quality new books and key books from all over the country. Over 30,000 books from more than 400 publishers and over 1,500 audio-visual products make the book fair dazzling. "Today's New Books," famous painters and young writers signing and selling books, holding lectures, and launching new book releases have made the book fair rich and varied.

　　三万多种优秀读物荟萃津门    
    天津举行第二届海河之春书展
    本报讯  去冬今春，国内图书市场由于种种原因跌入“低谷”，出版发行界为此感到焦虑。贾鲁生同志的报告文学《第二渠道》发表后，引起了出版业、发行业人士乃至广大读者的不同反响，孰是孰非不是几句话可以概括的。但有一点十分明显，即投稿难、出书难、买书难、卖书难的“怪圈”依然存在，并且大有难上加难的趋势。
    天津市新华书店几年来一直在探索主渠道发行体制的改革：１９８６年９月，在全国新华书店系统内率先成立了业务开发部，使信息的捕捉与处理具有系列性，实效性；引进风险经营机制，产生了新的生产力，使主渠道的经营机制增加了活力；为了适应日趋激烈的竞争和图书市场的变化，今年年初，天津市新华书店决定筹建天津市图书贸易公司。公司把业务开发部、业务科、批发书店、音像书店、工具书店以及天津最大的销售书店——东北角书店融为一体，使分散经营的各个部门，形成一个内部能协调力量的集团性经济实体，这是市店本身由管理型转向经营服务型的大胆尝试，也是在全国书店系统又一次率先改革的步骤；与此同时，天津市的各区书店、专业书店，由于“三金”下放和任期目标管理，使基层有了更多的自主权，进一步调动起干部职工的积极性。
    为了检验改革取得的成果，显示主渠道的实力，发挥主渠道的作用，天津市新华书店在图书市场对手林立、资金严重不足的情况下，毅然于４月中旬至５月初在天津工业展览馆举办第二届海河之春图书展销会。这次展销会坚持把社会效益放在首位，向广大读者提供大批优秀读物。
    近两个月来，天津市新华书店派出大批业务人员从全国各地组织了众多的质量较高的新书和重点书，４００多家出版社的３００００多种图书、１５００余种录音录像制品，使书展琳琅满目。“今日新书”，著名画家、青年作家签名售书，举办讲座和举行新书首发式等活动使书展丰富多采。
