A Soviet nuclear-powered submarine sank yesterday in the public sea off northern Norway. Several crew members lost their lives, and the Norwegian government is organizing experts to assess potential nuclear pollution.

The Norwegian Ministry of Defense informed reporters that the Soviet government notified the Norwegian government 12 hours after the incident. The Norwegian government immediately established a special committee to assess potential nuclear pollution.

According to reports, the submarine is of the "Mike (MIKE) class," weighing 7,000 tons, 110 meters long, with a crew of 95, powered by two nuclear reactors, and possibly carrying nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union has two submarines of this class, which use some new technologies in weapons, propulsion, and remote sensing systems.

Norway has dispatched military reconnaissance aircraft to the incident area for monitoring. Some experts believe that due to the remote location of the submarine's incident from the Norwegian northern coast, the likelihood of nuclear radiation threatening Norway is very low.

　　苏一艘核潜艇在挪北部公海沉没
    挪威组织专家监视可能出现的核污染
    本报斯德哥尔摩４月８日电  记者顾耀铭报道：据此间电台报道，一艘苏联核动力潜艇昨天在挪威北部公海沉没，一些船员丧生，挪威政府正在组织专家对有可能出现的核污染作出估价。
    挪威国防部向记者介绍说，苏联政府在这艘核潜艇出事１２小时后通知了挪威政府。挪威政府立即成立了一个特别委员会对有可能出现的核污染作出估价。
    据报道，这艘核潜艇为“迈克（ＭＩＫＥ）级”，７０００吨重，１１０米长，载员９５人，用２个核反应堆作动力，船上可能载有核武器。苏联共有２艘这个等级的潜艇，在武器、推进、遥测系统方面使用了一些新技术。
    挪威已派出军事侦察机到出事海域监视。一些专家认为由于该艇出事地点远离挪威北部海岸，对挪威造成核放射威胁的可能很少。
