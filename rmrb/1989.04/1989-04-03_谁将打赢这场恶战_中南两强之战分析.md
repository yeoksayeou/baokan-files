A fierce battle between the Chinese men's team and the South Korean team seems inevitable. The Chinese team originally hoped to enter the top eight knockout stage and preferred that Sweden and South Korea would face off in the same half of the bracket, allowing them to reap the benefits. However, things did not go as planned. In the second stage, Sweden was drawn in the same group as South Korea and defeated them, pushing South Korea into the same half as China.

In previous World Table Tennis Championships, the South Korean team already had a certain level of strength, but their prominent weakness was that they were fierce but unstable. The three players who took the court had uneven skill levels, so they never made it to the top four. Now, several Chinese coaches unanimously say that the South Korean team has become as threatening as the Swedish team. What are the main changes? In my opinion, the main changes are: first, Liu Nan-gui and Kim Ki-tae have improved their technical skills, becoming both fierce and stable; second, and more importantly, the emergence of the third main player Kim Jae-seok has made the team's strength more balanced. Kim Jae-seok has a stronger attacking ability than the old player Kim Man. His right-handed penhold loop drive has a powerful forehand and is also a threat on the mid-table. For the Chinese team, the relatively unknown Kim Jae-seok is a key figure. If he scores two points, the match will be difficult.

The Chinese team's lineup is likely to include Chen Longcan and Teng Yi, with the third player possibly being Jiang Jialiang or a new player. It is still uncertain, but Jiang Jialiang has a higher chance. Chen Longcan's playing style is tricky, and he has some strategies against Liu Nan-gui. If he can take down Liu Nan-gui at the start, it will lay a good foundation for victory. For the Chinese players, Kim Ki-tae is not particularly intimidating. If our players perform normally, they should be able to take two points from him.

In summary, the Chinese team and the South Korean team will have a fierce battle. The winner will advance to the final, while the loser will only be able to compete for the men's team bronze medal.

　　谁将打赢这场恶战
    ——中南两强之战分析
    中国男队与南朝鲜队之间的一场恶战看来很难避免了。中国队原来希望进入前八名淘汰赛后，最好瑞典队和南朝鲜队在同一半区先火并，自己坐取渔翁之利。然而事与愿违，瑞典队第二阶段与南朝鲜队抽在同组，并击败了对手。这样就把南朝鲜队挤到中国队这半区。
    前几届世乒赛时，南朝鲜队已具有一定实力，但突出的弱点是凶而不稳，三个上场队员水平总有点不平均，因此始终没有打入过前四名。现在，中国队几名教练一致表示，南朝鲜队已变得和瑞典队一样有威胁。那么最主要的变化在哪儿呢？我认为主要在于：一、刘南奎、金琦泽技术水平又有新长进，既凶又稳；二、更主要的是第三主力金泽洙的出现，使这个队实力更为整齐。金泽洙比原来的老将金浣有更强的进攻能力，他右手直握拍弧圈快攻打法，正手杀伤力大，中台对拉也很有威胁。对中国队来说，不太摸底的金泽洙是一个关键人物，如果让他拿两分，这球就不好打了。
    中国队出场的人选估计陈龙灿、滕毅是肯定要打的，另一人是出江嘉良还是一位新手，现在还说不好，出江的可能性大。陈龙灿球路刁钻，打刘南奎有些办法，如果一开始他拿下刘南奎，就能为取胜打下良好基础。对中国选手说，金琦泽不大可怕。如我队员发挥正常，应能从他身上拿两分。
    总之，中国队同南朝鲜队必有一场龙虎斗。胜者进入决赛，负者将只能争夺男团铜牌。　　　　　　  　　本报记者　刘小明
