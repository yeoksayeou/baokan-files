Railways Deploy More Patrol Police to Strengthen Train Security; Investigators Should Thoroughly Probe Those Who Plead for the 277 Train Case Criminals

    The People's Daily, Beijing, April 14—“Once identified, those who plead for the criminals involved in the 277 train theft case will be exposed through the media,” said Yu Fangzhun, Director of the Public Security Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, in an interview today.

    Since the 277 train theft case occurred, public security departments at all levels of the railway system have attached great importance to it. They have sent personnel to the Taiyuan Train Police Brigade to help with rectification and have established a joint investigation team to conduct an in-depth investigation.

    Yu Fangzhun mentioned that currently, similar security incidents like the 277 train case are not isolated on the railways. Criminal activities have become a pressing issue in passenger transportation. Criminals take advantage of the weak defensive capabilities of trains and the convenience of fleeing, committing crimes brazenly. In the first quarter of this year, the number of robbery, murder, and assault cases on the railways has increased significantly and is developing into gang-related crimes, posing a serious threat.

    To maintain train security, the Public Security Bureau of the Ministry of Railways decided yesterday to adjust the current police force, selecting high-quality officers to form patrol police teams to patrol and guard key passenger trains. Today, more than 600 patrol police from Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan, and other bureaus have boarded approximately 70 pairs of passenger trains.

　　铁路增派巡警强化列车治安
　　二七七车案说情者应彻查
    本报北京４月１４日讯　“为２７７次列车盗窃案犯罪分子说情者一经查实，将通过新闻媒介公之于众。”铁道部公安局局长岳方准今天在接受采访时这样说。
    ２７７次列车盗窃案发生后，铁路各级公安部门都很重视，已派人到太原乘警队帮助整顿，并成立联合调查组深入调查。
    岳方准谈到，当前，类似２７７次列车的治安事件，在铁路上不止一件，刑事犯罪已成为客运中亟待解决的问题。犯罪分子利用列车防卫力量薄弱、流窜逃遁方便的条件，猖狂作案。今年第一季度，发生在铁路上的抢劫、杀人、伤害案件明显上升，并向团伙犯罪发展，危害性很大。
    为维护列车治安，铁道部公安局昨天作出决定，调整现有警力，调集素质较好的干警组成巡警队，对重点旅客列车实行巡逻执勤。今天，北京、上海、沈阳、武汉等局已有６００余名巡警分别登上约７０对旅客列车。
