In yesterday's concluding session of the third meeting of the 10th Xi'an Municipal People's Congress, the candidate for the position of Prosecutor General of the Municipal Procuratorate, Jiao Chongxiang, recommended by the Congress Presidium, and the candidate, Zhu Bin, nominated by some Congress representatives, both failed to secure the required half of the votes in two formal elections. Xi'an will once again have a Prosecutor General who was not elected through formal procedures.

It is understood that this is the third time the Xi'an Municipal People's Congress has failed to elect a Prosecutor General, and the same two candidates have participated in the competitive elections each time. Zhu Bin is the former acting Prosecutor General, while Jiao Chongxiang is the current acting Prosecutor General. Both have certain achievements, but they also have different degrees of shortcomings and errors in terms of clean governance.

　　候选人欠廉洁　代表们不投票    
    西安选检察长三次流产
    据新华社西安４月２２日电（记者杨延礼、王世焕）在昨天结束的西安市第十届人民代表大会第三次会议上，由大会主席团推荐的市检察院检察长候选人焦崇祥和由大会部分代表提名的候选人朱彬，经过大会两次正式选举，得票都未超过法定半数。西安市将又一次出现没有经过正式选举产生的检察长。
    据悉，西安市人代会选举检察长流产，这已是第三次，而且三次参加差额选举的都是这两位候选人。朱彬是前任市代理检察长，焦崇祥是现任市代理检察长。他们都有一定政绩，但在为政清廉问题上却都有程度不同的缺点和错误。
