From April 13th to 15th, the Dai Autonomous Prefecture of Xishuangbanna in Yunnan Province held celebrations for the 1351st Dai New Year Water-Splashing Festival in its capital, Jinghong.

Amidst the sounds of gongs and drums, the flying water droplets carried the blessings of the Dai people, falling on the hosts and foreign guests, immersing everyone in the rich ethnic culture.

After a bumper harvest last year, the Dai people were jubilant and in high spirits for the festival. During the day, apart from splashing water and exchanging blessings, they also organized cockfighting, dragon boat racing, and releasing sky lanterns, all activities full of pioneering spirit.

At night, bonfires burned brightly along the banks of the Lancang River on the outskirts of the city, with crowds of people gathered. The calm river surface was adorned with fireworks lighting up the night sky.

Three hundred guests from various countries specially came to Xishuangbanna to participate in the Water-Splashing Festival.
