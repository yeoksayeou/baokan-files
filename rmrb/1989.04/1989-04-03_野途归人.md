	The Traveler Returning Home
		Illustration by Xiaoyan Rock
		Poem by Wang Junbing

	A small house filled with the aroma of milk tea,
		Eyes blue with longing.
		A faint wait, waiting for a familiar figure.
		Is he a husband? Is he a lover?
		Maybe yes, maybe no,
		In any case, he is the star that the family longs for.

		Behind the small house, smoke rises with a song,
		The song depicts the joy of a wedding.
		Did he go to the market? Did he visit relatives?
		Maybe yes, maybe no,
		In any case, he must bring joy to the family.

		Gradually, the path beneath his feet grows shorter,
		Faintly, the rooster crows in the village.
		He has heard that enchanting call,
		His heart has already leaped into the sweet reunion.

　　野途归人
    峭岩画
    王钧兵诗
    溢满奶茶香的小屋盼蓝了眼睛，
    淡淡的等待，等待一个亲近的身影。
    他是丈夫？他是情人？
    也许是，也许不是，
    总之，他是家人企盼的星星。
    小屋后伴炊烟飞出了歌声，
    那歌声描绘着迎亲的喜庆。
    他去赶集？他去探亲？
    也许是，也许不是，
    总之，他一定为家人带来欢腾。
    渐渐，脚下的路途近了，
    隐隐，传来村寨的鸡鸣。
    他已听到了那一声醉人的呼唤，
    心儿早迭进甜蜜的相逢。（附图片）
