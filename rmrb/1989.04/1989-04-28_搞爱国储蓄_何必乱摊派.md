	This March was the month for promoting patriotic savings in our city. All banks and savings institutions across the city took action, mobilizing the masses to save through radio and television broadcasts, achieving certain results. However, some banks, taking advantage of their control over the distribution of salaries and bonuses for certain units' employees, implemented mandatory savings allocations. For instance, a branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China required our unit to deduct 20% of each employee's salary for savings, otherwise, they would not release the salaries. Our unit's financial staff pleaded desperately, and only then were they able to withdraw the March salaries for the employees.

	Promoting patriotic savings is a great cause that benefits both the country and the people, but it should not be enforced through mandatory allocations. Banks should start with quality service to attract more depositors.

### 搞爱国储蓄  何必乱摊派

　　搞爱国储蓄  何必乱摊派
    今年３月是我市爱国储蓄宣传活动月。全市各家银行、储蓄所纷纷行动起来，通过广播、电视动员群众储蓄，取得了一定的成绩。但有的银行利用掌握一些单位职工工资、奖金的发放权，搞硬性储蓄摊派。如工商银行某办事处要求我单位每月扣除每个职工２０％工资搞储蓄，否则，他们就不给工资。我单位财会人员苦苦哀求，才勉强取出了３月份的职工工资。
    搞爱国储蓄是一件利国利民的大好事，但不能强行摊派。各家银行应从优质服务入手，争取更多的储户。
