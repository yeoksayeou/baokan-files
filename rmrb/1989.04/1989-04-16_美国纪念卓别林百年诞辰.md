The United States is commemorating the 100th anniversary of the birth of the world-renowned film artist Charlie Chaplin. Tonight, Peter Jennings, the host of the American Broadcasting Company's news program, praised Chaplin's brilliant film career with the words: "No artist in the world has made so many audiences laugh uncontrollably or shed tears as he has."

April 16th of this year marks the 100th anniversary of the birth of the world-famous film artist Charlie Chaplin. The American cultural and artistic community will hold various activities to commemorate his extraordinary life.

Chaplin was born in the slums of London, England, in 1889. In 1910, he came to the United States, and over the next 40 years, he produced many classic films, most of which were silent. In his films, he portrayed a wide range of comedic characters, from kings and dictators to workers and office clerks, making an unparalleled contribution to world cinema. After the war, Chaplin faced political persecution and personal attacks in the United States. The U.S. authorities listed him as a "suspected communist" and revoked his re-entry visa in 1952. Thereafter, he and his wife, Una O'Neill, the daughter of the famous American writer Eugene O'Neill, settled in Switzerland until his death in 1977.

In 1972, Chaplin returned to the United States to receive the title of Oscar Film Artist; in 1975, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom.

　　美国纪念卓别林百年诞辰
    本报华盛顿４月１４日电　记者仓立德报道：“世界上没有哪位艺术家能像他那样让那么多观众忍俊不住或潸然泪下”——美国广播公司新闻节目主持人彼得·詹宁斯今晚在广播中用这样一句话赞扬了卓别林的辉煌电影生涯。
    今年４月１６日是世界驰名电影艺术大师查理·卓别林诞辰１００周年，美国文化艺术界将举办各种形式的活动纪念他不平凡的一生。
    卓别林１８８９年出生于英国伦敦的贫民区，１９１０年到美国，此后４０余年，他制作了多部脍炙人口的影片，其中大多数是无声片。他在片中塑造了上至国王、独裁者，下至工人、小职员等各种喜剧性角色，为世界电影艺术作出了无与伦比的贡献。战后，卓别林在美国屡遭政治迫害和人身攻击，美国当局将他列为“共产党嫌疑分子”，并于１９５２年吊销了返美签证。此后，他和妻子——美国著名作家尤金·奥尼尔之女乌娜·奥尼尔定居瑞士，直至１９７７年病逝。
    卓别林曾于１９７２年到美国接受奥斯卡电影艺术家称号；１９７５年被英国女王伊丽莎白二世授予爵士称号。
