Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 31st.

Task Jianxin suggested establishing a hotline with NPC representatives. It is possible to report directly to the president of the Supreme People's Court if judicial personnel are found to be corrupt.

People's Daily, Beijing, March 31st. Reporter Wang Jianrong from Shanxi Daily reports: Supreme People's Court President Task Jianxin proposed that a hotline should be established with all NPC representatives. He welcomes NPC representatives to report and expose corrupt judicial officials directly to him.

Task's proposal was made today at the full meeting of the Shanxi delegation.

When discussing the issue of building a clean and honest judicial team, he said, "I often hear reports of officials refusing bribes and gifts, but I am somewhat concerned about those who do not refuse bribes and gifts."

He said: This issue deserves attention. I hope and welcome strengthened supervision of the court's work, especially strict supervision of the judicial team. The focus should be on maintaining integrity and enforcing the law seriously. I suggest establishing a hotline with representatives from Shanxi. If any representative hears of or sees corrupt officials in the judicial team, they can write to me directly, and I will definitely respond. I also suggest establishing a hotline with all 2,900-plus NPC representatives to report and expose corrupt officials in the judicial team.

    本报北京３月３１日讯  山西日报记者王建荣报道：最高人民法院院长任建新提出建议，希望同全国人大代表建立热线联系，欢迎全国人大代表直接向他检举揭发法院队伍中的贪赃枉法者。
    任院长的建议是今天在山西代表团全体会议上讲的。
    他在讲到法院队伍廉政建设问题时说，我常听到干部拒贿拒礼的报告，但我有些担心，没有拒贿拒礼的有多少。
    他说：这个问题值得警惕。我希望并欢迎加强对法院工作进行监督，特别是对法院队伍进行严格监督。重点是清正廉洁，严肃执法。我建议同山西的代表建立热线联系，各位代表听到、看到法院队伍中有贪赃枉法者直接给我写信，我一定回信；也建议希望同全国２９００多名人大代表都建立热线联系，检举揭发法院队伍中的贪赃枉法者。
