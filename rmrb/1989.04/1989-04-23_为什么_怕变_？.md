Title: Why Are People Afraid of Change?

People often hear the following rhyme: The Party's policies are like the moon, different on the first and fifteenth day.

The moon is a celestial body in the vast universe, unrelated to "policies." People use this analogy not to conduct astrophysical research but to express their confusion about some "changing policies overnight."

Frequent policy changes affect the masses the most. Even the policies related to daily necessities like "firewood, rice, oil, soy sauce, vinegar, and tea" can sometimes change so rapidly that people feel dizzy. Chinese people seem to have been not afraid of change, even eager for it, and dissatisfied with the status quo. But at some point, for some reason, people started to fear change. During a certain period, the "fear of change" was heard everywhere, with strong calls for it. To be honest, this "fear of change" is because people are afraid of the changes.

In the world, there is nothing that does not change. "Renew daily, renew daily, and renew again daily." Formulating new policies based on changing situations is also a normal phenomenon. However, when leaders decide on major political and economic policies, they lack foresight and democratic procedures, treating symptoms rather than causes, which is really inappropriate.

In the past ten years of reform, major political and economic policies have been introduced more than once. It should be said that many major policies have been proven effective by practice. However, some reform measures, such as price reforms, ownership reforms, wage reforms, etc., are often discussed for a while, some have already begun to be implemented, but have not truly taken effect, and are then abandoned halfway. Ten years have passed, some say the reform has entered a critical period, others say it has fallen into a predicament, but the consensus is that the reform has not yet succeeded, has not yet won.

Policies are the action guidelines that a country or party formulates to achieve the line of a certain historical period. Especially for major policies, their seriousness is beyond doubt. The formulation, issuance, implementation, and modification of national policies are all related to the livelihood of the people. In such a large country, frequent policy changes reveal that some major policies lack scientific decision-making processes and serious implementation. The consequences, of course, are serious. Of course, decision-makers' understanding of objective things has a process, and mistakes are inevitable. However, people hope that the formulation and issuance of reform plans and policies should be both active and cautious, and not "flip-flop." The country, enterprises, and the people cannot afford endless turmoil.

### 为什么“怕变”？

　　为什么“怕变”？
    啸虎
    人们常常可以听到这样一句顺口溜：党的政策像月亮，初一十五不一样。
    月亮，乃浩瀚宇宙中一运行天体，与“政策”没有什么联系。人们如此谈论，不是为了进行天体物理研究，而是借比喻来表达对一些“朝令夕改”作法的不理解。
    政策多变，群众感触最深。就是日常生活中必不可少的“柴米油盐酱醋茶”的政策，有时也变得令人晕头转向。中国人本来似乎是不怕变的，甚至想变、盼变，不安于现状。但不知起于何时，出于何故，国人开始怕变了。一时期，“怕变”论随处可闻，呼声颇高。老实说，这种“怕变”是因为变怕了。
    在世界上，不变的事物是没有的。“苟日新，日日新，又日新”。根据形势变化而制定新的政策，也是正常现象。但领导人在决定一些重大政治、经济政策时，缺乏预见性和民主程序，头疼医头，脚疼医脚，实在欠妥。
    十年改革，重大政治经济政策出台已不止一次。应该说，有不少重大政策已被实践证明是行之有效的。但是，也有些改革措施，比如，价格改革、所有制改革、工资改革等等，往往是议论了一阵，有的已开始实施，但还没有真正发挥其效应，却又被半途遗弃。十年过去，说改革“进入关键时期”者有之，说“陷入困境”者也有之，但改革还没成功，还没胜利，这是一致的。
    政策是国家或政党为实现一定历史时期的路线而制定的行动准则。特别是一些重大政策，其严肃性不容置疑。国家政策的酝酿、出台、实施、变更，都与国民生计攸关。偌大国家，政令多变，暴露了一些重大政策在决策过程中缺乏科学性，实施中缺乏严肃性。群众无所适从，其后果当然严重。当然，决策者对客观事物的认识有个过程，失误恐怕在所难免。但是，人们希望：改革方案和政策的出台既要积极又要慎重，不能“翻烧饼”，国家、企业、群众经不起穷折腾。
