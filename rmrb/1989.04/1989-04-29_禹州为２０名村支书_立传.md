Recently, Yuzhou City in Henan Province conferred the title of Labor Model on 20 village party branch secretaries and compiled their stories into the book "Yuzhou: A Gathering of Heroes."

In recent years, some grassroots cadres in Yuzhou's rural areas have found it difficult to perform their duties, feeling that the position is hard to hold, and that good work goes unnoticed while mistakes invite criticism. Some have preferred to focus on personal wealth accumulation. As a result, some party branches have become weak and disorganized. To address this situation, the municipal committee has conducted ideological education on the party's principles among grassroots cadres and implemented a target responsibility system, rewarding excellence and punishing poor performance.

These measures have motivated rural party members and cadres, to some extent, changing the "soft," "scattered," and "paralyzed" state of rural party organizations and enhancing the cohesion of the party. The collective economy of the entire city has been increasing at an annual rate of 12%. Guo Hongzhang, the party branch secretary of Guozhuang Village in Wuliang Town, led the villagers to establish 29 collective enterprises in three years, with 60% of the households earning over 10,000 yuan annually. Jin Xue, a female secretary in Zhangzhuang Village, Huashi Township, is known for her village's challenges: "high mountains, steep slopes, lack of water, and lack of grain." She led the villagers to accomplish three major tasks: first, raising 200,000 yuan to build an electric irrigation station and completing all ancillary projects, turning 550 mu of land into drought-resistant and flood-resistant fields, thus changing the historical reliance on weather for food; second, building a bridge; and third, constructing a road. The villagers say: The secretary thinks of everything for us. To honor these village party branch secretaries and gain societal respect, the municipal committee decided to write their biographies.

　　禹州为２０名村支书“立传”
    日前，河南省禹州市授予２０名农村党支部书记劳动模范的称号，并将其事迹编入《禹州群英荟萃》一书。
    近几年，禹州市一些农村基层干部感到事难办，“官”难当，干好了不显眼，干不好挨骂，不如个人发家致富，个别党支部处于软弱涣散状态。针对这种状况，市委在对基层干部进行党的宗旨教育的同时，在他们中推行了目标责任制，根据考评成绩奖优罚劣。
    这些措施调动了农村党员干部的积极性，在一定程度上改变了农村党组织“软”、“散”、“瘫”的状况，增强了党组织的凝聚力，全市集体经济每年以１２％的速度递增。无梁镇郭庄村党支部书记郭鸿章，带领群众３年办起２９个集体企业，６０％的农户年收入超万元。女支书靳雪所在的花石乡张寨村，“山高坡陡，地缺水，人缺粮”，是全市有名的贫困村。她带领群众办了三件事：一是筹资２０万元建成电灌站，并完善全部配套工程，使５５０亩土地变成旱涝保收田，改变了自古以来靠天吃饭的历史；二是架了桥；三是修了路。群众说：支书办事处处都想到俺心里。为了让这些农村党支部书记受到社会的尊重，市委特意决定为其“立传”。
