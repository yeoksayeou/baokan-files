There are still many things in science that have not been fully explored, and many mysteries remain unsolved. If these mysteries are unraveled, it is possible to create new technologies. The following are ten topics considered to be unsolved mysteries, which will be introduced in two parts in this journal.

Photosynthesis Mechanism

Plants convert solar energy into electron energy during photosynthesis, using this energy to synthesize glucose from water and carbon dioxide.

However, the photosynthesis process is actually related to a complex array of substances, with over 90% of these substances already identified. But there is still about 10% of the substances that are difficult to determine. For example, why do electrons move towards a specific direction and can be transferred? The reason is still unclear. Currently, thousands of scholars worldwide are working to solve the mystery of photosynthesis. Once this mystery is solved, it can be said that a revolution in photosynthesis has been achieved.

Photosynthesis generally consists of two processes: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions. The light-dependent reactions have two types: photosystem I and photosystem II. If photosystem II is elucidated, the mechanism of water decomposition through light can be understood, making it possible to decompose seawater and obtain an endless supply of clean, inexpensive hydrogen energy.

The Cause of Alzheimer's Disease

Alzheimer's disease is a typical symptom of senile dementia.

As people age, particularly after middle age, they are more likely to develop this disease, and currently, there is no known cure. There are two known causes of this disease: one is related to genetic factors, and the other is due to poor metabolism of nerve cells. The cause of the latter is still not fully understood.

Recently, it has been discovered that the development of Alzheimer's disease occurs in several stages. If treatment methods for each stage of development can be found, the problem can be addressed. This issue is currently being explored.

Drugs to Treat AIDS

Some people say that it will be difficult to develop a vaccine that directly defeats the AIDS virus within this century.

It is believed that there are four methods to treat AIDS, depending on the progression of the disease. The first method is to act directly on the AIDS virus itself. The second method is to act on the T cells (lymphocyte antibodies) of AIDS-infected individuals. The third method is to prevent the decline of immune function in AIDS patients and restore their immune function. The fourth method is to treat various infections caused by the decline in immune function.

AZT (azidothymidine) is currently the only recognized drug in the world for treating AIDS. However, this drug has significant side effects and is ineffective against the virus that has already infected T cell DNA, posing a high risk to infected patients.

The second promising drug for treating AIDS is dextran sulfate. This polysaccharide binds to the amino cations on the surface of the AIDS virus upon encounter. As a result, the AIDS virus loses its infectivity. The reason for this is still unclear.

The Truth About Gravitational Waves

In 1960, Joseph Weber of Stanford University in the United States first attempted to detect gravitational waves as predicted by the theory of relativity. Weber announced in 1968 that he had detected gravitational waves. Since then, the world has been trying to detect gravitational waves. However, after multiple attempts, gravitational waves have never been detected. It is said that even Weber's own detection results were not caused by gravitational waves.

However, recent findings indicate that there are intense phenomena in the universe that produce a large number of gravitational waves. For example, in a supernova explosion, a large amount of mass is destroyed and swept away in less than a thousandth of a second. If this is the case, it may be possible to detect gravitational waves. But the precision of current detectors is still not sufficient.

　　世界十大科技之谜
    在科学中还有很多东西没有探索清楚，还有很多不解之谜，如果解开了这些谜，也就有可能产生出更新的技术。现介绍被认为是不解之谜的１０个题目，分两次在本刊发表。
    光合机制
    植物在进行光合的时候，把太阳能变成电子能，利用电子能把水和二氧化碳合成葡萄糖。
    但光合过程实际上与复杂多样的物质有关，其中有９０％以上的物质已弄清，但还有约１０％的物质很难探明。例如，为什么电子飞向某个特定方向并能进行交接？其原因还不清楚。现在，世界上有几千名学者正在最后解开光合之谜。这个谜解开了，就可以说是完成了光合的革命。
    光合一般分为明反应和暗反应两个过程。明反应过程又有两种，即光化学反应系Ⅰ和Ⅱ。如果探明了光合成反应系Ⅱ，就可以知道水通过光进行分解的机制，也就可能分解海水而得到无穷尽的清洁的廉价氢能源。
    阿尔察默病的发生原因
    阿尔察默病是老年痴呆的典型病症。
    人过中年，岁数越大越容易患这种病，现在还不知道如何治疗。引起这种病的情况有两种，一是与遗传基因有关，二是神经细胞的新陈代谢不良。发生后一种情况的原因还不完全清楚。
    最近已经查明，阿尔察默病的发展分若干阶段，只要找到针对其每一发展阶段的治疗方法就好办了。现在正探索这个问题。
    治疗艾滋病的药物
    有人说，在本世纪内难以研制出直接制服艾滋病毒的艾滋病疫苗。
    据认为，适应病情的进展可有４种治疗艾滋病的方法。第一是对艾滋病毒本身起作用的。第二是对感染艾滋病的人的免疫系Ｔ细胞（淋巴腺中的抗体细胞）发生作用的。第三是防止艾滋病患者的免疫机能下降并使其机能恢复的。第四是对免疫机能下降引起的各种感染症的治疗。
    ＡＺＴ（叠氮基脱氧胸腺嘧啶核苷）是当今世界上唯一公认的治疗艾滋病的药。但这种药副作用很大，对于进入已感染的Ｔ细胞ＤＮＡ（脱氧核糖核酸）中的病毒无能为力，对已感染的患者既无效，危险性又很大。
    第二种有希望的治疗艾滋病的药是右旋糖酐硫酸等硫酸多糖。这种硫酸多糖与艾滋病毒遭遇，其表面上的氨阳离子和离子结合。结果，艾滋病毒便失去感染力。是什么原因还不清楚。
    重力波的真相
    １９６０年美国斯坦福大学的约瑟夫·韦伯第一次进行了试图测出相对论中所预言的重力波。韦伯于１９６８年宣布他测出了重力波。从此，全世界便开始测定重力波。但经过多次尝试，却一次也没有测出重力波。就连韦伯自己测出的结果，据说也不是由于重力波引起的。
    可是，最近查明，在宇宙中存在着发生大量重力波的激烈现象。例如，在超新星爆发中不到千分之一秒就有大量的质量遭破坏，被刮跑。如果是这样，也许可能测出重力波。但现在的检测仪的精确度还不够。
