	Prize activities have become rampant across the country in recent years, including prize shopping, prize bonds, prize tickets, prize savings, and prize donations. Some of these activities have helped concentrate idle social funds, alleviating the shortage of funds for national construction and social welfare projects. However, others have led to issues such as competing with the state for social idle funds, falsification, and deceiving consumers.

	According to the China Social Welfare Prize Donation Committee, last year, the state raised 150 million yuan through the sale of social welfare tickets, which were used for the construction of social welfare facilities. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China increased savings by 7.9 billion yuan through prize savings. These two prize activities, approved by the state, are a viable solution to the shortage of national funds. However, other units and departments that have organized various prize activities without authorization have caused some worrying problems:

	First, they have caused "bank account transfers," exacerbating the shortage of funds for national key construction projects.

	Second, some units, in order to attract buyers, keep increasing the attractiveness of prize activities. The allure of big prizes has led some people to buy lottery tickets beyond their economic capacity, with some even seeking help from supernatural forces or resorting to crime.

	Third, these unauthorized prize activities lack legal certification. Some units use prize activities as a means to sell substandard products, while others force enterprises and individuals to buy lottery tickets. There are even instances where units set up fake numbers for prize draws, deceiving buyers.

	Some insightful individuals have called for a cleanup and rectification of the various prize activities. Prize activities that clearly harm the interests of buyers and have improper uses of funds should be firmly banned by relevant authorities. Strict controls should be implemented in areas such as qualification review, legal certification, and financial auditing for prize activities.

### “有奖”活动多而滥  清理整顿不宜迟

　　“有奖”活动多而滥  清理整顿不宜迟
    据新华社北京４月２日电  （记者刘浦泉）近年来，在全国各地刮起了一股“有奖”活动风，诸如有奖购物、有奖债券、有奖售票、有奖储蓄、有奖募捐等。这些活动，有的起到了集中社会闲散资金，缓解国家建设、社会福利事业资金短缺的作用，有的却产生了与国家争抢社会闲散资金、弄虚作假、欺骗消费者等问题。
    据中国社会福利有奖募捐委员会透露，去年国家通过发售社会福利券，募集到１．５亿元资金用于社会福利设施建设；中国工商银行去年通过有奖储蓄增加了７９亿元存款。这两项经过国家批准的“有奖”活动是缓解国家资金短缺问题的一条出路。但其它一些单位和部门擅自主办的各类“有奖”活动，却带来了一些令人忧虑的问题：
    一是造成银行“存款搬家”，加剧了国家重点建设资金的短缺。
    二是一些单位为了吸引购券人，不断增加“有奖”活动的刺激性。重奖的刺激导致了一些人超过自身经济承受能力去购买彩券，有人甚至求鬼神相助或走上犯罪道路。
    三是这些未经国家批准的“有奖”活动，大都没有法律公证。有的单位把“有奖”活动作为推销劣质产品的一种手段，有的单位强行向企业和个人摊派彩券，还有的单位甚至设空号码摇奖欺骗购券人。
    一些有识之士在此间呼吁：对于形形色色的“有奖”活动，现在已到了该清理、整顿一下的时候了。凡明显损害购券人利益和收益用途不正当的“有奖”活动，有关方面应坚决取缔，并在资格审查、法律公证和财务审计等方面对“有奖”活动严格把关。
