Premier Marković Discusses Economic Reform Policies and Measures
Making Enterprises Independent Economic Entities

Yugoslav Federal Government Premier Ante Marković emphasized on April 24th during a discussion with business leaders that the fundamental reform policy of the new Yugoslav government is to first reform the irrational economic structure, making enterprises as independent and autonomous economic entities to the greatest extent possible, and vigorously promoting openness to the outside world.

Marković recently inspected several regions. He pointed out last night in Radenci during a discussion with Slovenian economic figures and managers of large enterprises that Yugoslavia must establish a new type of socialist system that can improve labor productivity and economic efficiency and create new value.

When discussing the causes of Yugoslavia's severe inflation, Marković said there are reasons inherent in the system itself, as well as reasons related to the methods of implementing the system. Additionally, there are issues with supply and demand imbalances and the lack of expected benefits from economic exchanges with the world. He stressed that the main cause of inflation is the economic structure. Therefore, only by formulating a series of long-term policies and complementary measures, fundamentally reforming the economic system and structure, and implementing new development policies and effective anti-inflation strategies, can the continued growth of inflation be halted.

　　南总理谈经济改革方针措施    
    使企业成为独立经济实体
    新华社贝尔格莱德４月２５日电  南斯拉夫联邦政府总理安·马尔科维奇２４日在同企业家们座谈时强调指出，南新政府的基本改革方针是首先改造不合理的经济结构，使企业最大限度地成为独立自主的经济实体，大力对外开放。
    马尔科维奇最近对一些地区进行了视察。他昨晚在拉登齐同斯洛文尼亚的经济人士和大企业的经理们举行座谈时指出，南斯拉夫必须建立一种能提高劳动生产率和经济效益，并能创造新价值的新型社会主义制度。
    马尔科维奇在谈到南斯拉夫高度通货膨胀的原因时说，有制度本身的原因，也有推行制度的方式方面的原因。另外，还有供求关系失调、同世界的经济交往没有产生应有的效益等原因。他强调指出，通货膨胀的主要原因是经济结构问题。因此，只有制定一系列长期政策和配套措施，根本改革经济体制和经济结构，制定新的发展政策和强有力的反通货膨胀策略，才能制止通货膨胀继续增长。
