On April 14, as China's population surpassed 11 billion, reporters from this newspaper traversed the cities and countryside of the mainland, where the sound of alarms echoed. The scenes and sounds they witnessed were a mix of joy and worry...

**Tianjin Maternity Hospital: A Cry at Birth, Welcoming This Unusual Day...**

Coo, coo, coo—is it a celebration? A cry of pain? Or a call for help? The baby girl born to the Liu family in the early hours of April 14 was taken to the newborn ward and immediately joined in the deafening chorus.

"Have a few less children! The population has surpassed 11 billion!"

The nurses in the obstetrics ward of the Tianjin Central Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, known for their strict and orderly management, moved between the narrow gaps between the beds, almost in unison, shouting this heartfelt plea to the reporter. Gentle actions. Loving gazes. Fatigue, pallor, tension, and the occupational hazard of a hoarse voice. A nurse has to take care of 40 newborns' eating, drinking, urinating, defecating, and sleeping!

Have a few less children? How is that possible?

In the obstetrics office, the doctors opened the records from April 12. On the first page, out of 10 women in labor, 5 had their second child, and among them, two women from Wuqing County had their third child! Tianjin City has maintained a family planning rate of 96% to 98% for seven consecutive years, but the annual growth rate is still higher than the national average. The situation is severe! In this hospital, 30% to 50% of those coming for surgery are unmarried and pregnant; there are also "overpopulation strike teams"—some farmers, individual business owners, and floating populations who are "rich and unafraid of fines, poor and unafraid of being fined, and won't stop until they have a son." The doctors sighed, "If family planning is tightened for a while and then relaxed, the population will explode!"

**Zhengzhou Suburbs: If Every Village Were Like Gongzhuang, This Day Would Be Pushed Back...**

The walls here seem to remind everyone that today is China's 11 billion population day. The reporter came to Gongzhuang Village in Maozhuang Township, Mengshan District, Zhengzhou City, located by the Yellow River. The most eye-catching words on the village walls are about family planning.

Gongzhuang Village is beautiful in a pastoral way.

It is not only green but also quiet. There are no groups of children that are usually seen in villages...

Old Party Secretary Qiong Qiusun said, "In our village of over 3,700 people, the population has increased by less than 100 in the 10 years since 1979, and our income has more than doubled. Our village's prosperity comes from counting the population."

Farmer Li Genchun calculated his family's finances: "My parents had seven children, and we had nothing to eat or wear. When we grew up, we only grew beards, not height. Now I only have one daughter, and she is well-fed and healthy. It's better to have fewer children!"

Qiong Qiusun told the reporter, "This work is difficult. However, the masses look at the cadres, and the Party members look at the Party branch, so I will start with myself." Under his leadership, in the past 10 years, all 65 Party members, 9 village cadres, and 12 village committee heads, including their relatives and friends, have not had a single person violate the family planning policy and have an extra child.

The leaders of Mengshan District deeply felt that if every village and unit in family planning work were like Gongzhuang, this day would be pushed back...

**Guangzhou Streets: People Crowding, Colliding, Bumping, and Pressing...**

The streets and alleys of Guangzhou are filled with bustling crowds. This familiar scene of the city has been turned into a rhyme: "People crowding on the streets, people colliding in tea houses, people bumping in parks, people pressing in cars."

The reporter learned from relevant sources that Guangdong's per capita arable land has decreased from 1.5 mu 40 years ago to today's 0.65 mu. Although grain production increases every year, it is still tight. In 30 years, Guangzhou City has built over 20 million square meters of new residential buildings, but the population has increased by 720,000. In the 54.4 square kilometers of the urban center, 2.19 million people are living, and the road area per capita is only 2 square meters...

The leader of the Guangzhou Municipal Urban and Rural Construction Commission sighed, "Guangzhou's residential and traffic construction development speed is leading in major cities across the country, but it is all offset by population growth!"

The scattered households, individual business owners, unemployed, and backward regions' farmers in Guangzhou's urban and rural areas have a strong feudal traditional concept of preferring sons, believing that more children mean more blessings, and raising children to support old age. Last year alone, there were 12,000 people in the suburbs who gave birth outside the plan. In the northern mountainous area of Jiufo Town, a farmer had 12 children to "gamble" for a son. Although all of them were raised, the parents were "aged before their time" under the pressure of life, and the children could not receive a good education.

Relevant personnel pointed out: If the rapid population growth is not curbed in time, Guangdong's economic construction will be unbearable. People, have you ever thought about this in the crowd?

**Haikou Pier: Another Group of Job Seekers Comes Ashore, Bringing a "Guerrilla Team" for Overpopulation...**

Another ferry docked at Haikou Pier, and the passengers from the south, carrying bags and luggage, also brought hopes of finding a job. The development of the special economic zone has made Hainan, with only 6 million people, face an unusually severe population explosion.

Today, the reporter learned from the Hainan Provincial Health Department and the Provincial Population Bureau that in 1988, the province's over-planned births reached over 90,000.

In Hainan, "work sheds" have become "protected areas" for overpopulation. Inside the Haikou Airport Camp, you will see a row of work sheds. Here, 112 households of migrant workers live, totaling 566 people. This group of people, 95% of whom come from Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Hunan, are mostly in their mid-30s and are in the peak of their reproductive years; some people come here just to "have another child," and the work shed area has become a "protected area" for violating birth policies.

A vegetable farmer from Jieyang County, Guangdong, is only 35 years old this year but is already the father of five children. However, his desire to have children has not diminished.

**Sichuan Xinjin: Wang Sufang, This Busy Worker in Family Planning, Tastes the Bittersweet...**

There is a rhyme in rural Sichuan: "Agricultural technicians come to eat fermented egg soup, Party and government cadres have tea and rice, and family planning cadres get 'hit with a stick.'"

Today, the reporter met Wang Sufang, the deputy village head of Da'an Village, Fangxing Township, Xinjin County, who is participating in the "11 Billion Population Day" activity. This 56-year-old rural cadre has experienced the bittersweet of family planning work.

In November last year, she discovered that a 7-year-old girl in the village named Yang suddenly disappeared. After several visits, she found the door locked, and she became suspicious. Later, it was found that Yang was 4 months pregnant. Wang Sufang persuaded her to take remedial measures, but she fled the next day. Wang Sufang searched everywhere and finally found Yang at her maternal home. She made Yang admit her mistake and have an abortion.

However, for women who temporarily cannot have children due to physiological barriers, Wang Sufang is like the "Goddess of Childbirth." Wang Chunxiang from Baihe Village has been married for three or four years without getting pregnant, which made her very distressed. Wang Sufang heard about this and personally visited her, taking the couple to the hospital for examination and treatment, and finally, Wang Chunxiang had a chubby baby.

Under Wang Sufang's patient and meticulous work, all 203 couples of childbearing age in Da'an Village have taken contraceptive measures, and the village has had no over-planned births for 9 consecutive years.

**Beijing: On April 14, China's 11 billion population day, family planning workers in Beijing took to the streets to promote and consult.**

**Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 14.**

### “４·１４”，意味着什么？——“中国１１亿人口日”见闻

　　“４·１４”，意味着什么？
　　——“中国１１亿人口日”见闻
　　本报记者
    ４月１４日，在我国人口突破１１亿大关之际，本报记者在响彻警钟的大陆城乡走访，所见所闻，忧喜交织……
　天津产院：呱呱堕地，迎来这不平凡的一天……
    呱呱呱，是狂欢？是痛哭？还是呼号？４月１４日凌晨降生的刘姓女婴，被抱到新生儿室中，立刻参加了那震耳欲聋的大合唱。
    “少生一点儿吧！１１亿突破啦！”
    以管理正规、严格著称的天津中心妇产科医院产科护士们，穿行在狭窄的床隙，几乎异口同声地用高嗓门向记者呼出这一心声。轻柔的操作。母爱的眼神。疲惫、苍白、紧张，加上嗓音嘶哑的职业病。一个护士要管４０个新生儿的吃、喝、拉、撒、睡！
    少生一点？哪儿行呢？
    在产科办公室，大夫们打开４月１２日记录。第１页１０位产妇，就有５位生的是第２胎，其中武清县两位产妇中有一位生的还是第３胎！天津市连续７年计划生育率达９６％至９８％，但年平均增长率却高于全国增长速度。局面严峻！在这家医院，来做手术的有３０％到５０％是未婚先孕；还有“超生突击队”——农民、个体户、流动人口中一些人，“富的不怕罚，穷的罚不怕，不见小子不撒手”。大夫感叹：“计划生育再抓得紧一阵松一阵，人口更得爆炸！”

　郑州郊区：都像弓寨这样，今天这个日子就会往后推……
    这里的面面墙壁，似乎都在提醒人们，今天是我国１１亿人口日。记者来到位于黄河岸边的郑州市邙山区毛庄乡弓寨村，村头墙壁最醒目的字样就是计划生育。
    弓寨村的美是田园式的。
    这里不仅富有绿色，而且幽静。这里没有通常村庄可见的一群群孩童……老支书弓秋顺说：“我们这个３７００多人的村庄，从１９７９年以来的１０年里，人口增加不足１００，收入翻了一番多。我们村的富裕，靠的是算人口帐。”
    农民李根来算了他的家庭经济帐：“俺爹娘生俺兄妹７个，吃没吃的，穿没穿的，长大了也是只长胡子不长个。俺现在只有一个女孩，养得水灵灵的，还是孩子少了好！”
    弓秋顺对记者说：“这工作是难。不过，群众看干部，党员看支部，那就从我做起。”在他的带动下，１０年来，全村６５个党员、９个村干部和１２个村民小组组长，包括他们的子弟亲友，硬是没有１人违反计划生育政策超生孩子的。
    邙山区领导深有感触地对我们说，如果每个村子、每个单位在计划生育工作中都像弓寨这样，今天这个日子就会往后推……

　广州街头：人挤人，人撞人，人碰人，人压人……
    广州市的大街小巷，到处涌动着熙熙攘攘的人流。这司空见惯的羊城景观，早有人编了一个顺口溜：街上人挤人，茶楼人撞人，公园人碰人，汽车人压人。
    记者从有关方面了解到：广东的人均耕地已从４０年前的１．５亩降至今天的０．６５亩，尽管粮食年年增产，却年年吃紧。３０年间，广州市新建住宅２００多万平方米，但人口却净增７２万人，５４．４平方公里的市中心区，聚居着２１９万人口，道路的人均面积仅有２平方米……
    广州市城乡建设委员会领导慨叹：“广州市住宅建设和交通建设的发展速度，在全国各大城市是居领先地位的，但都给人口膨胀抵消了！”
    散落在广州城乡的空挂户、个体户、无业户和后进地区的农民，存在着浓厚的重男轻女、多子多福、养儿防老等封建传统观念。去年仅是郊县计划外的生育就有１．２万人。北郊山区九佛镇一个农民为“搏”一个男孩而生育了１２个小孩。虽然个个都养活了，但父母却在生活的重压下“未老先衰”，子女也无法受到良好的教育。
    有关人士指出：如果不尽快遏制人口的过快增长，广东的经济建设必将不堪重负，人们啊，在拥挤中你可曾想过这一点？　　　（梁兆明）
　海口码头：又一群谋业者涌上岸，也带来一支“超生游击队”……
    又一班轮渡靠上海口码头，南下的旅客肩负手提，带着行李，也怀着谋业的希望，涌上岸。特区开发，使只有６００多万人口的海南，面临着格外严峻的人口暴涨浪潮。
    记者今天在海南省卫生厅、省人口局了解到，１９８８年全省超计划生育就达到９万多人。
    在海南，“工棚”成了超生的“保护区”。在海南机场营区内，你会见到一片工棚，这里居住着１１２户民工，总人数为５６６人。这批人９５％来自广东、广西、四川、湖南等省区，平均年龄３５岁上下，大多数正处于生育高峰期；有的人就是为“再生”而来，工棚区成了违反生育政策的“保护区”。
    来自广东揭阳县的一个菜农，今年虽只３５岁，却已是５个孩子的爸爸，但生儿育女之心仍未泯灭。

　四川新津：王素芳，这个忙于计划生育工作的普通妇女，饱尝酸甜
    　　苦辣……
    四川农村有句顺口溜：“农技干部来了吃醪糟蛋，党政干部茶泡饭，计划生育干部‘挨扁担’”。
    记者今天在新津县见到了正在参加“１１亿人口日”活动的方兴乡大安村副村长王素芳。这位５６岁的农村干部饱尝了计划生育工作的酸甜苦辣。
    去年１１月，她发现本村已有一个７岁女孩的杨某突然不见了，几次上门，均见大门紧锁，她顿生疑窦。后来查实杨已怀孕４个月了。王素芳左说右劝，要她去作补救措施，没想到她第二天外逃躲起来了。王素芳东寻西找，直找到杨的娘家。终于使杨某认了错，引了产。
    但王素芳对因生理障碍暂时不能生育的妇女，又好像是“送子观音”。白鹤村的王春香结婚三四年一直没有怀孕，为此十分苦恼。王素芳闻知此事，亲自上门拜访，带他们夫妇到医院检查、治疗，终于使王春香得了个胖娃娃。
    在王素芳耐心细致的工作下，大安村２０３对育龄夫妇中，对对都采取了节育措施，全村连续９年没有计划外生育。　　　　（罗茂城）（附图片）
    4月14日，是中国11亿人口日。北京计划生育工作者纷纷上街宣传、咨询。		  本报记者王东摄
