Title: The Unwinnable War on Coca

American advisors and Bolivian police, aboard five "Cobra" armed helicopters, hovered over the Beni region of Bolivia. Suddenly, the police opened fire on the shadows and thatched huts in the jungle below. This is a recent scene from the National Geographic magazine depicting Bolivia's eradication of coca. The bushes on the hillside, resembling cabbage, are coca plants.

Coca is a small evergreen shrub, only a few feet tall, with long, oval, leathery leaves. For centuries, residents of the Andes Mountains in South America have had the habit of chewing coca leaves. They periodically stuff a handful of coca leaves into their mouths, chew them, and suck the juice. To this day, indigenous people in South American countries still maintain this custom. In 1862, an Austrian scientist brought back some coca leaves from Peru and extracted a biological alkaloid, naming it cocaine. People who inhale it feel invigorated and euphoric. Now, this substance has become one of the most widespread drugs globally. American satellite data shows that the global area of coca cultivation exceeds 400,000 acres, with 97% of the coca plants growing in a few South American countries. In Bolivia, with a population of only six million, about 500,000 farmers are engaged in the cultivation and processing of coca leaves, and at least 100,000 people are involved in the trafficking and trade of coca leaves. Due to the unique social and political environment in the United States, most of the cocaine from South American countries is smuggled there. Drugs made from cocaine come in various forms, and "crack cocaine," known as the "fast-food of drugs," takes effect within 15 seconds after being smoked and can cause addiction after just one or two uses.

In recent years, drug abuse has been rampant in the United States, with six million addicts. Drug abuse has led to various accidents and a large number of criminal cases, causing the United States to suffer an economic loss of 110 billion dollars annually. Drugs have become the number one problem in the United States, and the U.S. government blames coca, exhausting all efforts to wage a protracted war against the coca plant.

As early as 1985, the United States had reached an agreement with Bolivia: for every hectare of coca eradicated, the cultivators would receive approximately $2,000 in subsidies from the United States. However, the root system of coca is well-developed and highly resilient, making eradication difficult. Moreover, coca leaves can be harvested multiple times a year, and each kilogram of coca paste is worth $500. What attraction does $2,000 have for the cultivators?

Recently, representatives from 40 coca growers' associations in Bolivia accused the government of not implementing a plan to help farmers develop other economic crops as promised, forcing farmers to continue focusing on "mining green gold." The U.S.-assisted plan to eradicate coca in Bolivia has been implemented for several years, with few takers and minimal results. The coca forests have not decreased but have instead expanded.

When soft measures failed, the United States, with the Bolivian government's consent, took drastic actions. In 1986, the U.S. government sent troops into Bolivia to destroy a batch of coca leaf processing plants. However, four months later, cultivation, collection, and trafficking resumed as before.

Now, American advisors often take extreme actions with Bolivian police. However, destroying one area leads to the emergence of another; as one drug trafficker is imprisoned, another emerges. Some Americans suggest spraying rust remover on the coca forests. They believe that if stopping the boiling water is ineffective, why not remove the pot from the fire? However, this method is also unfeasible because the U.S. federal court has explicitly prohibited the spraying of chemicals on marijuana leaves within the United States. If this is done in another country, it will certainly cause many diplomatic disputes, not to mention that Bolivian law also does not allow such actions.

The coca cultivation industry thrives mainly because the demand for drugs in the U.S. market is too high. The U.S. government does not focus on eliminating the domestic scourge but instead wages war on the coca forests of poor small countries. This inverted approach, if not changed, will only lead to an endless and costly war on coca.

### 打不赢的古柯战

　　打不赢的古柯战
    美国顾问和玻利维亚警察，分乘五架“眼镜蛇”武装直升机，在玻利维亚贝尼山区上空盘旋，突然警察举枪向下面丛林里的人影及茅草房扫射……这是最近一期美国《全国地理杂志》描绘的玻利维亚扫荡古柯的情景。山坡上，那些花椰菜般的丛林就是古柯树。
    古柯树是一种只有几英尺高的常绿灌木，叶子呈长圆形，革质，有韧性。自古以来，南美安第斯山上的居民就有口嚼古柯叶的习惯。他们隔一阵子就要往嘴里塞一把古柯叶，嚼碎后吮吸其汁。至今，南美各国的印第安人仍然保留着这种习俗。一八六二年，一位奥地利科学探险家从秘鲁带回一些古柯叶，从中提炼出一种生物碱，取名可卡因。人们吸食它，会感到浑身畅快、飘飘欲仙。现在，此物已成为泛滥全球的主要毒品。美国卫星资料表明，全世界古柯种植面积超过四十万英亩，其中，百分之九十七的古柯树生长在南美几个国家。在只有六百万人口的玻利维亚，从事古柯叶种植和加工的农民约有五十万，从事古柯叶贩运和贸易的人不少于十万。由于美国具有特殊的社会政治环境，所以南美诸国的可卡因几乎全部被偷运到那里。用可卡因配制的毒品五花八门，被人们称为“毒品快餐”的“快乐客”，人吸后十五秒钟即产生效果，并且吸一、二次就上瘾。
    近几年，美国吸毒之风甚盛，“瘾君子”已达六百万人，吸毒导致各种事故和大量犯罪案件的发生，使美国每年经济损失达一千一百亿美元。毒品已成为美国国内头号问题，美国政府归咎于古柯，绞尽脑汁向古柯树发起了一场旷日持久的战争。
    早在一九八五年，美国就与玻利维亚达成过协议：种植者每拔掉一公顷古柯，便可从美国领到约二千美元的补助金。但古柯根系很发达，生命力特强，根除并非易事，且古柯叶每年可采摘数次，每公斤古柯浆就价值五百美元，二千美元对于种植者又有多大的吸引力呢？
    玻利维亚四十个种植者协会的代表最近指责政府没有像承诺的那样制订出一个帮助农民发展其它经济作物的计划，迫使农民不得不把主要精力继续放在“开采绿矿”上。美国协助玻利维亚根除古柯树的计划推行了数年，应者寥寥，收效甚微，古柯林不见减少，反而日趋扩大。
    软的不行，美国征得玻政府同意，就荷枪实弹地动真格的了，一九八六年，美国政府曾派兵进入玻利维亚摧毁了一批古柯叶加工厂。但四个月后，种植、收购、贩卖，一切又恢复原样。
    如今，美国顾问经常与玻利维亚警察一起采取极端行动。可东坡毁了西沟建，加工点层出不穷；一个毒品贩子刚被投入监狱，另一个亡命徒又冒出来……一些美国人建议向古柯林喷撒除锈剂。他们认为，既然扬汤止沸无济于事，何不来个釜底抽薪？但是，这个办法也行不通，因为美国联邦法院曾明文禁止向美国境内的大麻叶喷撒化合物，如果到别国去干此事，肯定会引出许多外交纠纷，更何况玻利维亚的法律也不允许这样做。
    古柯种植业兴旺不衰，主要原因是美国毒品市场需求过旺。美国政府不致力于清除国内沉疴，却向贫穷小国的古柯林大兴问罪之师。这种本末倒置的做法如不改变，劳师费财的古柯战只能无休止地进行下去。
