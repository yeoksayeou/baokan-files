Using a wedding to collect gifts worth 20,000 yuan, treating subordinates like servants

    Liu Enshang and Wang Shaoyan couple dismissed

    HARBIN, April 26 (Xinhua) — Liu Enshang and Wang Shaoyan, who caused a sensation in Tongjiang, Heilongjiang Province, by accepting 20,000 yuan in gifts for their son's wedding, have been disciplined.

    Liu Enshang, deputy director of the Tongjiang Municipal People's Congress Standing Committee, has been placed on probation for one year within the Party and dismissed from his post as deputy director. Wang Shaoyan, director of the municipal finance bureau, has been expelled from the Party and dismissed from his post as director. The public funds and electricity bureau's reimbursed accommodation fees totaling nearly 8,000 yuan have been confiscated. Liu Liyan, director of the municipal electricity bureau, and others who used public funds to curry favor and covered up for the Liu couple by issuing false certificates have been disciplined.

    On the day of the Liu couple's son's wedding, almost no one in the municipal finance bureau showed up for work, and few middle-level cadres in the municipal party committee and government were present. Of the 48 tables of guests at the wedding, there were 18 municipal-level cadres and 140 bureau-level cadres. During the wedding, 20,295 yuan in gifts were received, of which 6,797 yuan were public funds.

    The Liu couple's grand wedding for their son was carried out with the assistance of the municipal finance bureau and the municipal people's congress. During the wedding preparations, Liu and Wang invited 10 or more people to their home twice to discuss and arrange the details, deciding that two deputy bureau-level cadres would be the hosts and establishing reception, banquet arrangement, and service groups. At the same time, they instructed a deputy director and two ordinary cadres of the finance bureau to handle the wedding invitations. They also sent finance bureau cadres to purchase fresh fish and other food items hundreds of miles away and assigned specific people to set up tables to collect gifts.

　　借婚事收礼两万　视下级如同家仆    
    刘恩赏夫妇被撤职
    本报哈尔滨４月２６日电  记者武培真报道：为儿子办婚事收受２万多元礼钱，一时轰动黑龙江省同江市的刘恩赏、王少燕夫妇，近日受到党纪政纪处分。
    作为市人大常委会副主任的刘恩赏，被留党察看１年、撤销市人大副主任职务。作为市财政局长的王少燕，被开除党籍和撤销市财政局长职务。对其收受的公款及电业局核销的食宿费近８０００元，全部收缴。用公款送人情和以出假证、伪证包庇刘氏夫妇问题的市电业局长刘丽艳等，分别受到党纪政纪处分。
    刘氏夫妇的儿子结婚之日，市财政局机关几乎无人上班，市委、市政府机关的中层干部也所剩无几。参加婚礼的４８桌人中，有市级干部１８人，局级干部１４０人。婚礼期间，收受款２０２９５元，其中公款占６７９７元。
    刘氏夫妇为儿子的婚礼大操大办，是在市财政局和市人大协助下进行的。婚礼筹备期间刘、王２人先后２次邀请１０余人在家研究部署，确定由２名副局级干部为主持人，并成立了接待组、婚宴安排组和服务组；同时，责成财政局１名副局长和２名一般干部负责婚礼通知。还派财政局干部坐车到二三百里外采购鲜鱼等食品，派专人设帐桌收礼。
