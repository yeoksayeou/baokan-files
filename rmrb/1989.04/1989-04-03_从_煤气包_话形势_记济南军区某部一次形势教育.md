	Talking About the Situation from the "Gas Bags"
	—Recording a Situation Education Session in a Certain Unit of the Jinan Military Region

	Last year, the "gas bags" that the Iron Man Wang Jinxi swore to throw into the Pacific Ocean decades ago reappeared on public buses in Kaifeng, Henan.

	In an instant, this matter became a topic of discussion among the locals, and even within the military barracks, everyone was talking about it.

	Some said, "The Iron Man had already thrown away the hat of being backward in oil, but now it's back. How is the situation like this?" Others lamented, "It seems like the situation has regressed..."

	This matter quickly caught the attention of the military leadership. The Party Committee decided to start from the "gas bags" and conduct a situation education session for the entire unit. The Party Committee did not set the tone; instead, officers and soldiers were allowed to express their own views.

	The discussion quickly formed two main viewpoints: some believed that China's oil-powered equipment had developed, and the supply of crude oil was insufficient, so the appearance of "gas bags" was normal and a good thing; others believed that "gas bags" mounted on buses were unsightly and showed backwardness. Its reappearance indicated that the reform had led to a bad situation. Some even began to doubt the success of the reform. To help everyone understand more, the unit invited Zhang Jingxiang, the deputy mayor of Kaifeng, to introduce the local situation. Starting from the hot topic, from the local situation to the national situation, the officers and soldiers' horizons were broadened.

	Ten years of reform had rapidly developed Kaifeng's national economy and various social undertakings. In 1987, compared to 1978, the city's total industrial and agricultural output value increased by 1.53 times, grain production increased by 7.6 times, and the output value of township enterprises quadrupled.

	However, just like many other places, Kaifeng also faced many problems during the reform process: people's ideas were outdated, many cadres had serious bureaucratism; agriculture was backward, industrial output value was only equivalent to a county in southern provinces; there were shortages of electricity, water, and fuel. If these phenomena were not correctly analyzed and compared, and if one only focused on the problems, one would become increasingly discouraged.

	The unit also organized officers and soldiers to visit Kaifeng City Bus Company and Kaifeng Petroleum Company. The leaders of these two companies introduced that the gas bags on Kaifeng's streets were qualitatively different from those seen by the Iron Man in the past. Back then, the gas bags contained coal gas, but today's gas bags contain natural gas. At that time, China's crude oil production was only a few million tons, and there was indeed no oil to use. In 1987, China's crude oil production reached 134 million tons, ranking among the top five oil-producing countries in the world. With the development of China's economic construction and the continuous increase in oil-powered equipment, coupled with the limitations of oil extraction, refining, and transportation, the planned oil supply gap in various places was relatively large. Kaifeng City Bus Company currently has 142 buses, but the planned oil supply is still the standard for 70 buses in 1982. Currently, the company needs to add 600 tons of high-priced oil each year, and each ton of high-priced oil is nearly 600 yuan more expensive than the standard price. Including other factors of material price increases, the municipal finance's annual subsidy of 350,000 yuan is like a drop in the bucket. Therefore, to ensure that the public's travel is not affected, Kaifeng City found a way to replace oil with gas. Although these beautiful buses carry a large gas bag, "affecting the view," the effect of this move cannot be underestimated. The cost of public buses using gasoline per kilometer is 0.24 yuan, but after switching to natural gas, the cost is only 0.10 yuan. It not only reduces costs but also saves gasoline, easing the current situation of tight oil supply and transportation.

	The situation became clearer, and the understanding became consistent. The achievements of ten years of reform are enormous, but there are many difficulties at present, and many problems have been exposed. "Everyone's road should be paved by everyone." Now, the officers and soldiers of this unit are actively contributing their ideas for the development of the local area. At the same time, their enthusiasm for training has increased.

　　从“煤气包”话形势
    ——记济南军区某部一次形势教育
    去年底，几十年前铁人王进喜发誓要扔进太平洋的“煤气包”又在河南开封市的公共汽车上“露脸”了。
    一时间，此事进入街谈巷议，驻地军营内大家也议论起来。
    有人说：“王铁人早把石油落后的帽子扔到了太平洋，如今又捡了回来，这形势咋整的？”有人悲叹：“看来形势倒退了……！”
    这件事很快引起部队领导的重视。党委决定从“煤气包”谈起，在全部队开展形势教育。党委不定调子，由干部战士各抒己见。
    讨论很快形成两种主要观点：有些人认为，我国的用油机具发展了，原油产量供不应求，于是“煤气包”出现是正常的，是好事情；有些人认为，“煤气包”架在车上，有碍观瞻，也显得落后，它的重现是改革一定出现糟糕局面了。甚至有些人对改革成功产生了怀疑。为了帮助大家掌握更多的材料，部队请来了开封市副市长张景祥，请他介绍驻地形势。从热门话题讲起，由驻地看全国，拓宽干部战士的视野。
    十年改革，使开封市国民经济和各项社会事业得到迅速发展，１９８７年与１９７８年相比，全市工农业总产值增长１．５３倍，粮食总产量增长７．６倍，乡镇企业产值翻了四番。
    但是，正像许多地方一样，在改革的过程中，开封也存在着不少问题：人的思想观念陈旧，不少干部存在严重的官僚主义；农业落后，工业产值仅相当于南方省份的一个县；缺电、缺水、缺燃料等，对这些现象，如果不作正确的分析和比较，眼睛只盯住问题的确会越看越泄气。
    部队还组织官兵走访了开封市公交公司和开封石油公司。这两家公司领导介绍，开封市街头上的气包，已与昔日王铁人所看到的气包有着质的不同，那时气包里装的是煤气，今天的气包里装的是天然气。那时我国的原油产量仅有十几万吨，确实是无油可用。１９８７年我国的原油产量已达１．３４亿吨，产量跨入世界产油国前５名之列。随着我国经济建设的发展和用油机具的不断增加，加上受石油开采、炼制和运输的限制，各地计划内供油缺口较大。开封市公交公司现有客车１４２辆，但计划内用油仍是１９８２年７０辆车时的指标。目前，该公司每年要添６００吨高价油，而每吨高价油高出平价近６００元，加上其它材料涨价因素，市财政每年３５万元的补贴犹如杯水车薪。所以，为了保证群众乘车不受影响，开封市便寻找出了以气代油的办法。尽管这些漂亮的客车驮上个大气包，“有碍观瞻”，但此举的作用不可低估。公共汽车每公里用汽油的开支需０．２４元，改用天然气后，开支只需要０．１０元，它不仅降低了成本，也节约了汽油，缓解了当前石油供应紧张和交通运输紧张的状况。
    形势越看越清，认识趋向一致；改革十年成绩巨大，但目前的困难很多，暴露出的问题也不少。“大家的路要大家铺”。现在该部队的官兵为驻地发展纷纷献计献策。同时练兵的热情更高了。
