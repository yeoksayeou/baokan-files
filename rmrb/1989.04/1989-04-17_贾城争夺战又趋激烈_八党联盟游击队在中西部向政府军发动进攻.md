People's Daily, Islamabad, April 17th - According to local newspapers and foreign news agencies, the battle between the seven-party alliance guerrillas and the Kabul government forces for control of the Salang Pass and the Kabul-Jalalabad Road has intensified, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides.

The guerrillas launched the offensive to cut off Soviet aid to Kabul and government reinforcements to Jalalabad. In recent days, the guerrillas have repeatedly attacked the Kabul garrison along the Salang Pass and destroyed several military vehicles coming from the Soviet direction. The road has been damaged in multiple locations.

On the Kabul-Jalalabad Road, the guerrillas blew up several bridges and seized a number of convoys carrying military supplies and food from Kabul to Jalalabad. A guerrilla commander said that in recent days, not a single military vehicle has been able to pass through this road. The guerrillas have also cut off the supply line to the government's 31st Division stationed south of Jalalabad. According to the guerrillas, they have breached the outer defenses of Jalalabad, and the Kabul government has airlifted 1,600 soldiers to reinforce the city. Meanwhile, Radio Kabul claims that the Salang Pass and the Kabul-Jalalabad Road are still under government control.

Additionally, it is reported that Khalili, the leader of the eight-party alliance based in Iran, said at a recent press conference that the Shiite guerrillas operating in central and western Afghanistan have launched attacks on local Kabul government forces. They have completed a comprehensive plan to attack Kabul. Khalili also stated that the guerrillas oppose the Soviet and Kabul regime's demand to establish United Nations observation posts on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.

　　贾城争夺战又趋激烈
　　八党联盟游击队在中西部向政府军发动进攻
    本报伊斯兰堡４月１７日电　记者任毓骏报道：综合当地报纸及外电今天消息，阿富汗七党联盟游击队和喀布尔政府军之间争夺萨朗公路和喀布尔—贾拉拉巴德公路的战事日趋激烈，双方死伤惨重。
    据报道，游击队发起公路争夺战的目的是分别切断苏联对喀布尔的援助和喀布尔对贾拉拉巴德的增援。连日来，游击队在萨朗公路两侧多次发起对喀布尔守军的攻击，并炸毁一些来自苏联方向的军车。这条公路多处遭破坏。
    在喀布尔—贾拉拉巴德公路上，游击队炸毁了一些桥梁，缴获了数批喀布尔政府支援贾拉拉巴德的军火和食品的运输车队。一名游击队司令说，近日来，没有一辆军车能通过这条公路。游击队还切断了驻守在贾拉拉巴德市南的政府军第三十一旅的供应线。据游击队方面称，游击队已攻破贾拉拉巴德市的外围防线，喀布尔政府又空运１６００名士兵支援贾拉拉巴德。与此同时，喀布尔电台声称，萨朗公路和喀布尔—贾拉拉巴德公路都仍在政府军控制之下。
    另据报道，以伊朗为基地的阿富汗八党联盟负责人哈利利在最近的一次记者招待会上称，活动在阿富汗中西部的什叶派游击队已对当地的喀布尔政府军发起攻击。他们全面攻打喀布尔的作战计划已制订完毕，哈利利还说，游击队反对苏联和喀布尔政权关于在巴阿边界建立联合国部队观察点的要求。
