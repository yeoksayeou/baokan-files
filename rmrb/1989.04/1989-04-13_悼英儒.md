Title: In Memory of Yingru

That day, my wife and I went to the hospital to visit Comrade Yingru. He was already too weak to open his eyes, but it seemed he heard my voice and wanted to sit up. This was typical of Yingru, who was always polite to others. Our child helped him up, but he couldn't support himself and was immediately laid back down. That very night, Yingru passed away. I was deeply saddened, always thinking that he had expended his last bit of strength to receive us.

In the early 1960s, I worked with Yingru in the General Political Department's Creation Studio. He was a bit older, and we all respected him greatly. Whether in conduct or in writing, I often sought his advice. Yingru had been diligent in his studies since childhood and had excellent calligraphy. In traditional Chinese education, literature and history are inseparable. He had a solid foundation in literature and history from a young age and began publishing poems and essays under a pen name while in middle school. Several military writers in the Creation Studio often gathered at Yingru's home, discussing life, writing, playing chess, and painting. His wife, Zhang Shuwen, would make us congee and flatbread, laughing as she said, "I am your stronghold household." This was a specific term used in the anti-Japanese war in the Ji region. They had both worked underground in the Japanese-occupied area of Baoding. In Yingru's famous novels such as "Wild Fire, Spring Wind, and the Ancient City," one can see glimpses of the author and his family. Yingru was both a literary and a military figure. After the "July 7th Incident," he served as a reporter and editor in the Eighth Route Army, edited the "Star Fire News" published by the guerrilla army's political department, and even served as a battalion commander. Listening to him casually recount his battle experiences, I could fully imagine this tall man from Shandong and Hebei, carrying his double-barreled shotgun, moving in and out of the gunfire.

Such a strong man, steeped in literature and tempered by war, seemed to have all paths open to him. Ultimately, he chose literary writing. He left us a wealth of valuable literature. He wrote nine long novels, some of which were translated into more than ten languages and introduced to the world. Among them, the long novels "Female Guerrilla Commander" and "The Previous Generation" were written in prison under the persecution of the "Gang of Four." He asked his family to bring "Das Kapital" and "Selected Works of Lenin" during visits, and he would tear his hands to get iodine, using toothpaste tubes to make pens and writing with iodine. The pages, margins, and spaces between lines of "Das Kapital" were filled with neat, tiny characters. After his release, he made a few revisions and published the book. In his later years, Yingru often said a folk proverb, "At seventy, don't stay overnight; at eighty, don't stay for a meal," meaning that when one is old, one might leave at any time. However, at the age of seventy, he was bedridden for a long time but still wrote like a madman. Last summer, when he finished the last line of his novel "Souls Broken in Qincheng" on his sickbed, he secretly took a sip of beer behind the doctor's back, sighed deeply, and said, "No more writing! No more writing! Never again!" In truth, he couldn't write another word.

When we friends talk about Yingru, we always say, "A person who can shoot well, write well, play chess well, and paint well—what more could you ask for?" Even so, now that he is gone forever, I still feel a deep sense of loss for him and for our literary cause. Yingru could have done so much more!

　　悼英儒
　　徐怀中
    那天我们夫妇去医院探望英儒同志，他已经无力睁开眼睛，似乎是听到了我说话的声音，表示要坐起来。这就是英儒的为人，他习惯了礼貌待人。孩子扶他起来，不能支持，即刻又扶他躺下了。就在当天晚上，英儒离我们而去了。我说不出的难过，总想着他正是为了接待我们，耗费了他最后的一点气力。
    60年代初，我和英儒同在总政治部创作室。他年长一些，我们大家都很敬重他，无论作人和为文，我常常向他请教。英儒自幼读书用功，写得一笔好字。旧学文史不分家，他幼年便打下了相当厚实的文学和史学功底，考入中学便使用笔名发表诗文了。创作室几个部队作家常在英儒家里聚会，谈生活，谈写作，下棋作画。他的爱人张淑文大姐就为我们熬小米粥、烙大饼吃，她笑着说：“我是你们的堡垒户。”这是抗日战争时期冀中地区使用的特定语言，他们夫妇曾一同在保定日伪统治区做地下工作。从英儒的《野火春风斗古城》等著名小说中，随处都可以窥见作者自己和他的亲人的身影。英儒能文能武，“七·七事变”后即在八路军担任记者、编辑，
  主编过游击军政治部出版的
  《星火报》，又当过步兵团长。
  听他漫不经心地讲述自己亲历
  的战斗生活，我完全可以想象
  这位冀鲁大汉怎样拎着他的
  “二把匣子”，出入于枪林弹雨
  之中。
      英儒这样一个浸透了文墨
  和经受过战火锤炼的强者，似
  乎条条道路都为他开放着。
  终于他还是选择了文学写作。
  他为我们留下了大量的宝贵文
  字，仅长篇小说就有九部，有
  的被译为10多种外文，介绍到
  了世界各地。其中《女游击队长》、《上一代人》两部长篇，是受“四人帮”迫害，在狱中写出初稿的。他要家人探监时带了《资本论》和《列宁选集》等厚本头书，自己弄破了手，向看守要了紫药水，又用牙膏皮制成笔，蘸着紫药水写作。《资本论》的扉页、天头、地脚和行距间，密密麻麻写满了工整的蝇头小楷，出狱后稍加整理就出书了。英儒晚年爱讲一句俗话，“七十不留宿，八十不留饭”，意思是人年事高了，随时都有可能辞世而去。可是他在70高龄，久卧病床，还痴狂一般地写作。去年夏天，当他在病床上写完长篇小说《魂断秦城》的最后一行字时，背着医生呷了一口啤酒，长长舒一口气说：“不写了！不写了！再也不写了！”实在说，再多一行字他也写不动了。
    谈到英儒，我们几个朋友总说，一个人，枪打得好，字写得好，文章写得好，棋下得好，可以了，还要怎么样？！虽这么说，现在他永远去了，我还是为他痛感遗憾，为我们的文学事业痛感遗憾，英儒本来还可以做多少事啊！
