The Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee plenary session opened this morning in the Spanish Hall of the Prague Castle. General Secretary Jakub in his report emphasized the need for steady reform and reiterated the Party's unchanging stance on the 1968 events.

Jakub reviewed the measures taken in the reform since last December's 12th Plenum of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and stressed that "in reform, we must act in an organized and coordinated manner. Failure to resolutely implement decisions will complicate reform; similarly, ignoring real conditions and hastening development will also complicate reform; however, we must not adopt a wait-and-see attitude or be overly cautious in areas where obvious rapid progress can be made."

In discussing the activities of opposition groups in Czechoslovakia, Jakub said that it is necessary to firmly combat these "anti-socialist forces."

He believed that "we frankly and critically point out the problems and shortcomings that we must address, but this does not mean denigrating the achievements of our predecessors."

　　雅克什在捷共中央全会上强调
    要稳步进行改革
    新华社布拉格３月３０日电  捷共中央全会今天上午在布拉格宫西班牙大厅开幕。总书记雅克什在会上作报告，强调要稳步进行改革，并重申对１９６８年事件的立场不变。
    雅克什回顾了从去年１２月捷共１２中全会以来在改革方面所采取的措施后强调，在改革方面“必须有组织地协调行动。不坚决履行决议会使改革复杂化；同时不考虑现实条件加快发展的愿望也会使改革复杂化；然而决不允许在一切明显可以迅速前进的地方，采取观望和谨小慎微的做法”。
    雅克什在谈到反对派组织在捷的活动时说，必须与这些“反社会主义势力坚决斗争”。
    他认为，“我们坦率和批评性地指出我们必须解决的问题和缺点，但这决不意味着贬低前辈的业绩。”
