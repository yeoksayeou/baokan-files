Togo's economic revival shows initial success. According to Xinhua News Agency, Lome, April 5. After taking office in 1967, Togolese President Eyadema attached great importance to agricultural development. Togo has become one of the few African countries that have achieved self-sufficiency in grain production and have the highest economic growth rate.

In recent years, the Togolese government has taken a series of adjustment and reform measures, and the national economy has shown a good momentum that has been rare in the past 10 years. In 1988, the gross domestic product reached 398 billion CFA francs, an increase of 4% over 1987.

With the improvement of the national economic situation, the inflation rate has dropped from two digits in the early 1980s to 3.8% in 1988. The national fiscal deficit is also gradually decreasing.

Although Togo has made great efforts to revitalize its national economy, it still has a long way to go to achieve economic independence.

　　多哥振兴经济  初步取得成效
    据新华社洛美４月５日电  多哥总统埃亚德马１９６７年执政后十分重视农业发展。多哥已成为非洲国家中为数不多的几个粮食实现自给、经济增长率最高的国家之一。
    近几年来，多哥政府采取了一系列调整和改革措施，国民经济出现了１０年来少有的好势头。１９８８年国内生产总值达３９８０亿非洲法郎，比１９８７年增长４％。
    随着国家经济状况的改善，通货膨胀率由８０年代初的两个百分数下降到１９８８年的３．８％。国家财政赤字也在逐步减少。
    多哥虽然为振兴民族经济作出了很大努力，但要实现经济独立尚需走一段漫长的道路。
