A newspaper criticism has helped to ease the "difficulty in watching movies" for one million children in Tianjin.

On April 2, *Jinwan Evening News* published an article pointing out: Tianjin has 1,033,800 children aged 3 to 10, but among the city's 34 professional cinemas and 103 cinemas and theaters, there is only one professional children's cinema. If all the children in the city were to watch a movie, it would take 22 years and 9 months!

This fact is shocking. The Tianjin Film Company immediately studied and began to improve the situation. Starting from yesterday, 8 cinemas have begun showing children's special screenings, and the children are overjoyed.

　　一则报纸批评　少儿看电影有门
    本报天津４月１０日电　一则报纸批评，为天津百万儿童开始缓解了“观影难”。
    ４月２日《今晚报》刊文指出：天津３至１０岁少年儿童达１０３．３８万人，而全市３４家专业影院、１０３家影剧院中，只有一家专业儿童影院。全市儿童如全看一次电影，须用２２年零９个月！
    这个事实触目惊心。天津市电影公司迅即研究并着手改进，从昨天起已由８家影院放映儿童专场，孩子们对此雀跃不已。
