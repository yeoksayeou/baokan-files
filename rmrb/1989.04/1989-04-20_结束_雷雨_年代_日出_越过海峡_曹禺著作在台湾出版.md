The Taiwan-based *United Daily News* reported in February under the headline "Cao Yu's Plays Meet the Sunrise" that Cao Yu's works have ended their long "Thunderstorm" era in Taiwan.

The article states: The 78-year-old Cao Yu, who serves as the chairman of the "Chinese Theater" (a mistranslation for the chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association), was a renowned writer in the 1930s. He created works such as "Thunderstorm," "Sunrise," "Wild Field," "Peking Man," "Home," and "Transformation."

The report continues: During the martial law period, Cao Yu's works were banned due to his political status. However, after being reviewed by the Taiwan News and Publication Bureau according to the management guidelines for mainland publications, it was deemed that "the content poses no significant issues" and was approved for publication. A Taiwanese publishing house has obtained the authorization from Cao Yu to publish a collection of his works in five volumes.

Last year, a friend from the theater community who returned to the mainland from Taiwan mentioned that Cao Yu's scripts have been made available in Taiwan's libraries and are highly appreciated by theater professionals, especially university students studying the arts.

　　结束“雷雨”年代　“日出”越过海峡    
    曹禺著作在台湾出版
    本报讯  台湾《联合报》今年２月以《曹禺剧作逢日出》为题报道了一条消息，说曹禺剧作结束了在台湾多年遭“雷雨”的年代。
    文章写道：现年７８岁、担任大陆“中国剧场主席”（为中国戏剧家协会主席之误）的曹禺是三十年代负盛名的作家，创作了《雷雨》、《日出》、《原野》、《北京人》、《家》、《蜕变》等作品。
    继又报道：“戒严”时期，曹禺因其身份，著作被查禁，现经台湾新闻出版处按大陆出版品管理要点审核，认为“内容并无大碍，准予出版。”台湾一家出版社取得曹禺授权，出版其作品集五册。
    去年台湾回大陆探亲的戏剧界朋友曾谈起，曹禺剧本已在台图书馆开放，深得戏剧界同行特别是学文艺的大学生的喜爱。
