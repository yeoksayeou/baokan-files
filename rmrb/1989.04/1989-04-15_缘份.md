In the courtyard of Wanshou Temple in the western suburbs of Beijing, peach blossoms are in full bloom, their pale red petals vibrant and fresh, heralding neither spring nor foretelling joy. Indeed, at this time, the usually quiet China Modern Literature Museum became lively and bustling with the arrival of Master Sheng Yun from Taiwan and his entourage. Laughter and cheerful conversations filled the air, as if welcoming a distant relative returning home. He is both a high Buddhist monk and a fellow literary figure, no wonder during his meeting with a group of famous writers in Beijing, Buddhist teachings and literary elegance flowed so naturally and harmoniously. The author had the fortune to witness this grand event and was honored to be present, feeling overjoyed. In the midst of this joy, I recalled the beginning of last year when I had an unexpected encounter with Master Sheng Yun while visiting Xilai Temple in Los Angeles.

It was all thanks to Gao Guangbo, a friend I had just made there. He was extremely warm-hearted and sincere, with a soft and mellow voice. Later, I learned that he was a television announcer and also a member of the Los Angeles Symphony Chorus. Every time he invited us to dinner, he would order a large table of dishes, but he himself would only eat a small plate in front of him. After several times, I found out that he was a devout Buddhist and therefore only ate vegetarian food. He said, "If what I do can make others happy, I am very satisfied." He was a man in his thirties, but he had made this his life's philosophy. So, he was always busy, working for his job and for others' requests, but he always wore a charming smile. One day, he told me that his philosophy came from his teacher, Master Sheng Yun. It was then that I learned about this renowned monk from Taiwan, who had established the vast Buddhist holy land of Foguangshan in Kaohsiung, and founded numerous cultural, educational, medical, disaster relief, elderly care, and charitable organizations beneficial to society. Then, he came to the United States and built a magnificent Xilai Temple in the suburbs of Los Angeles, spreading Buddhism to the West and taking on the responsibility of educating and providing welfare for North American Chinese.

That day, Gao Guangbo drove for over an hour on the famous Los Angeles freeway before arriving at a secluded and desolate mountain. I was surprised to see such a magnificent Buddhist temple in the United States, built with the most advanced materials and techniques. Compared to many famous temples I had seen in China, its scale was much larger. As we walked down the mountain slope, we saw about twenty beautiful and exquisite villas scattered at the foot of the mountain, like a new village. These were all managed by Xilai Temple. It was in one of these villas that I met Master Sheng Yun. He was over sixty years old, robust and tall, with a humorous and witty way of speaking, soft voice, and a demeanor that was elegant and warm. He talked to me about literature, fate, intellectuals, and life. His thick northern accent had a charm, and although we had just met, it felt like we were old friends chatting freely and happily. He treated me to a vegetarian meal, which was the most exquisite vegetarian meal I had ever had. Beside us, eight monks and nuns were attending to us. The master pointed to a young nun and said that they were his translators during his lectures in North America, all of whom were master's degree graduates. After the meal, the master gave me two copies of his book "Star Cloud Zen Talk." He had written dozens of books on Buddhist studies, Zen talks, and essays, and his works were vast. He enthusiastically invited me to stay there, but I had other things to do and had to decline.

That night, back at my residence, I couldn't sleep and started reading his book. The writing was clear and straightforward, with each short piece telling a story and elaborating on it. He told people, "In dealing with others, one should first know oneself and be true to oneself..." "The best education is education through love." Because the language was concise and full of vivid metaphors, wisdom, love, and deep meaning, it had a strong enlightening effect, quite different from the usual stale preaching. This is how Master Sheng Yun gained more and more followers. I also felt the power of Master Sheng Yun from the sincere and kind Gao Guangbo.

However, I never imagined that just a year later, he would come to the mainland to visit, reunite with relatives, and spread the Dharma. I think it is fate. Nowadays, peace, dialogue, communication, and understanding have become a global trend. I am so happy to see him again. That day, at the Modern Literature Museum, because there were many guests and the time was short, I expressed my regret to Master Sheng Yun, saying, "This time we didn't have the chance to have a detailed conversation." Master Sheng Yun held my hand and said seriously, "I will come again."

　　缘份
　　丹晨
    北京西郊万寿寺院落里，桃花盛开，浅红鲜艳，不史报春，也还预喻喜事。果然，就在这时，台湾星云大师一行来访使寄寓在此一向寂静的中国现代文学馆热闹非凡。欢声笑语不绝，像是迎着远方归来的亲人。他既是佛门高僧，又是文学同行，怪不得，与北京这群著名作家会晤时，佛学禅理，文学灵韵，大家讲得那么亲切投机。笔者有幸躬逢其盛，叨陪末座，欣喜之余，想起去年初，在洛杉矶拜谒西来寺时与星云大师的一次意外会晤。
    那是因为高光渤君的引见。他是我到了那里新结识的友人，极为热情诚恳，讲话声音温和醇美。后来，我才知道他是电视台播音员，也是洛杉矶乐团合唱队员。他每次请我们吃饭，要了一大桌菜，自己却只吃面前一小碟。次数多了，才知道他是一位虔诚的佛教徒，所以只吃素食。他说：“我做的一切，如果能使别人快乐，我就很满足了”。他是一位３０岁左右的青年人，却把此人为人生信念。所以，他一天到晚忙忙碌碌，为了工作，为了别人的托付，却总是带着迷人的笑容。有一天，他告诉我，他这个信念来自他的师父星云大师。由此，我才知道台湾有这样一位驰名世界的高僧，开创了高雄佛光山规模宏大的佛教圣地，创办了有益于世道人心的文化出版、研究、教育、医疗救灾济贫、养老育幼、慈善福利等等大批事业。然后，他又飘然来到美国，在洛杉矶近郊哈西安达建造了一座宏伟的西来寺，把佛教推向西方，广为传播弘法的同时，还将对北美华人尽种种教育福利之责。
    那天高光渤君驾车在著名的洛杉矶高速公路上奔驰了一个多小时才来到一座幽静而孤寂的大山前。我竟然意外在美国看到这样一座金碧辉煌的佛教殿宇，完全是用现代化最先进的材料和工艺建成的。比起我在国内看到过的许多著名庙宇规模都要宏大。当我们沿着山坡漫步往下走时，又看见一、二十幢漂亮精致的别墅，像是一个新的村落一样散布在山脚下。这都是归西来寺管理的。就在那里的一座别墅，我见到了星云大师。他年过六旬，健硕魁梧，谈吐充满幽默机智，轻声细语，给人一种举止文雅、亲切温暖的感觉。他与我谈文学，谈缘份，谈知识分子，谈人生。他那浓重的苏北乡音中有一种魅力，虽然初识，却像是相知已久的故旧那样随意而快活。他设素斋款待我。这也是我从未吃过的一次极为精美的素斋。旁边有八位僧尼在招呼照顾我们。大师指着一位年轻的女尼说，她们是他在北美弘法布道演讲时的翻译，都是硕士毕业生。斋罢，大师又赠我他的著作《星云禅话》两册。他著有佛学研究、禅话、艺文数十种，可谓著作等身。他热情地邀我在那里留宿，我因有别的事，只好辞谢了。
    那晚，回到住所，夜不能寐，就翻他的著作。行文明白晓畅，每则短文讲一故事并作发挥。他告诉人：“为人处世，应先认识自己，忠于自己……”“最好的教育是爱的教育”。因为言简意赅，又多形象譬喻而洋溢着智慧、爱心和深意，因此阐释禅机富有启示性，迥然不同于一般陈腐的说教。这才使星云拥有愈来愈多的信徒。我从这位诚恳善良的高光渤君身上也感受到了星云的力量。
    但是，我无论如何没有想到，仅仅过了一年，他竟又飘然来到大陆访问探亲弘法。我想是一种缘份。如今世道，和平、对话、沟通、理解，已经成了一种世界性的潮流。我多么高兴再见到他。那天，在现代文学馆，因为客人多，时间短暂，我对星云大师表示遗憾说：“这次没有机会细叙了。”星云握着我的手，正色说：“我还要来的。”
