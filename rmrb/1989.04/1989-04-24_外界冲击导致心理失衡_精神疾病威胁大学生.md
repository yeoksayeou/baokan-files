External impacts leading to psychological imbalance
Mental illness threatening college students

According to Xinhua News Agency, a report from a recent conference at Zhejiang University, the second National College Health and Hygiene Symposium, revealed that mental illness has become a serious threat to the normal study and life of college students.

In recent years, cases of college students taking leave or dropping out due to illness have seen mental illness as the leading cause, far surpassing infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and hepatitis. Preventing and treating mental illness among college students has become an urgent task in college health and hygiene work.

An analysis by relevant departments in Beijing of the situation in 16 universities in the city showed that in recent years, the number of students taking leave due to mental illness accounted for 37.9% of the total number of students taking leave due to illness, and the number of students dropping out due to mental illness accounted for 64.4% of the total number of students dropping out due to illness, both ranking first among the causes of student leave and dropout. A sample survey of 1,332 students at a university in Tianjin showed that 24.92% of students fell within the range of mild to severe neurotic tendencies; 34.68% fell within the range of various types of autonomic nervous dysfunction.

Some scholars, in analyzing the high probability of mental illness among college students, pointed out that current social and campus life in China are undergoing major changes. The introduction of a competitive mechanism into colleges, difficulties in job placement after graduation, and the phenomenon of "inverted body and mind" in society have had a tremendous impact on the psychological state of college students. Moreover, college students are in a period of physiological, psychological, and ideological change, with relatively poor psychological endurance, making it highly likely that they will experience severe psychological imbalances, even leading to mental illness. They call on psychologists, sociologists, and educators to pay attention to this issue, and to work with the education and health departments to effectively prevent and treat it.

　　外界冲击导致心理失衡    
    精神疾病威胁大学生
    据新华社杭州４月２４日电（实习生汪中国）日前在浙江大学结束的第二届全国高校卫生保健研讨会上传出信息：精神疾病已构成对高校学生正常学习和生活的严重威胁。
    近几年大学生因病休、退学的病例中，精神疾病已占据第一位，远远超过肺结核、肝炎等传染病。预防与治疗大学生精神疾病已成为高校卫生保健工作的当务之急。
    北京有关部门对该市１６所高校本科生因精神疾病休学、退学情况进行的分析表明：近几年因精神疾病休学的人数占因病休学总人数的３７．９％，因精神疾病退学的人数占因病退学总人数的６４．４％，均占学生因病休、退学病种的首位。天津某高校对１３３２名学生抽样调查结果反映出：有２４．９２％的学生属于轻度和重度神经症倾向范围；有３４．６８％属于不同性质的植物神经失调。
    一些学者在分析高校学生精神疾病高概率发生的原因时指出：当前我国社会乃至校园生活正处于大变革时期，竞争机制引入高校，毕业分配困难以及社会上存在的“体脑倒挂”现象，对大学生的心理状态产生了巨大冲击，加之大学生正处于生理、心理以及思想变化时期，心理承受能力较差，因而极有可能发生严重的心理失衡，甚至导致精神疾病。他们呼吁心理、社会、教育学家对此予以关注，配合教育、卫生部门，加以有效地预防与治疗。
