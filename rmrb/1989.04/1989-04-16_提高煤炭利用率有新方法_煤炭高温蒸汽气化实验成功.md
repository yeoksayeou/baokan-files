Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 16th.

A recent successful experiment conducted by the Energy Research Institute under the joint leadership of the State Planning Commission and the Chinese Academy of Sciences has shown that using 1200 degrees Celsius high-temperature steam to gasify coal can produce "high-quality and cost-effective" coal gas.

Experts believe that this achievement opens up a new path for improving coal utilization rates and increasing the level of coal-to-oil substitution, which is of great significance for the development of China's economy, which relies mainly on coal as its primary energy source.

This high-tech technology has been applied for a patent with the State Patent Office. To expedite its application in production, the Energy Research Institute is preparing to conduct expanded trials and will select ideal domestic and international partners for cooperation.

　　提高煤炭利用率有新方法
　　煤炭高温蒸汽气化实验成功
    新华社北京４月１６日电　（记者赵明亮）国家计委和中国科学院共同领导的能源研究所最近进行的一次成功实验表明，利用１２００摄氏度高温蒸汽对煤炭进行气化，可获得“物美价廉”的煤气。
    专家认为，这项成果为提高煤炭利用率和提高以煤代油水平开辟了一条新途径，对于以煤为主要能源的我国经济的发展具有重要意义。
    这一高科技技术已向国家专利局申报了专利，为尽快使之应用于生产，能源研究所正准备进行扩大试验，并将在国内外选择理想的合作伙伴。
