	“Why pick up someone else’s burden? Optimizing the labor force, can good performance make the unit demote you?” A company manager, upon hearing that the unit would receive excess personnel from another unit to perform temporary labor, flew into a rage and reprimanded the labor and personnel department head without distinguishing right from wrong.

	In this manager’s mind, there seems to be a logic: excess personnel—poor quality—burden—elimination. In fact, this is not universally applicable. Among the more than 2,500 enterprises in Beijing currently implementing labor optimization, over 70,000 people have been listed as excess personnel. According to the authors' investigation, many of these individuals have good technical skills and a positive work attitude. How did these people end up being listed as excess personnel by their enterprises?

	Situation One: “Offend the stove, no hot tofu to eat.” On the “list of excess personnel” in the assembly workshop of a certain factory, many names have the word “troublemaker” written next to them. What does “troublemaker” mean? Simply put, the leadership thinks he likes to cause trouble or does not respect the leadership.

	A worker angrily told the authors: “Our boss is so concerned about face that he doesn’t allow anyone to say ‘no.’ Once, he was late by half an hour, and I gave him some advice. I didn’t expect to stir up a hornet’s nest. He criticized me in front of everyone for lowering the leader’s prestige and having bad intentions. This time, he made me an excess worker.”

	A worker named Zhu Shiping summed up the principle of the workshop director Zhang’s labor optimization: those who listen to him—optimized; those who don’t—excess. Little Zhu introduced that when the optimization work began, Director Zhang started thinking about the candidates. His cronies were all included, and he took the opportunity to build relationships with them. Little Zhu, known for his hard work, did not know how to read the leader’s mind, so during the workshop’s optimization meeting, Director Zhang first targeted him as an excess worker, creating public opinion by saying: “Little Zhu, although he has been selected as an advanced worker consecutively, he still has many shortcomings…”

	“Are you praising me or criticizing me?” Little Zhu, at the critical moment, still did not “know his place” and ran into the gunfire.

	“How? The tiger’s butt is untouchable, you are too arrogant, right? Can this workshop not accommodate you?” Director Zhang said, and in front of everyone, he marked an X next to Little Zhu’s name on the list of optimized personnel.

	The authors also heard a story in a certain company: The office director pushed a drawer full of meal tickets and a food canteen seal to Little Chen and said warmly: “Work hard, and don’t make any mistakes.”

	Little Chen, facing this mess, said helplessly: “I can’t accept these meal tickets without counting and processing them; otherwise, I’ll have trouble later.”

	“If you don’t want to do it, forget it. There are plenty of people who can sell meal tickets. You have one week to leave the canteen!”

	Little Chen could only laugh and cry, and he told the managing director about this incident, hoping to gain his sympathy and support. However, the managing director said: “Your director is someone I appointed. If you don’t follow his leadership, you are not following my leadership. Please don’t sow discord between our leaders, okay?”

	Naturally, Little Chen’s arm was no match for the thigh…

	Situation Two: “Relationship studies” deeply influence labor optimization. There is an example that can illustrate this. In a certain factory, a team of 7 workers needed to have 1 person listed as excess. The team leader, who held the power of life and death, began to calculate: among these 7 people, excluding himself, there was 1 who was a cousin of the factory leader and was naturally in the optimization list; there were 2 introduced by the deputy manager of the company, who could not be offended; there were 2 who were his cronies, and he had promised to protect them before the optimization. Sorry, it had to be Little Yang.

	Situation Three: “Yin decline, Yang rise.” Due to well-known reasons, female workers in some enterprises are the first to be targeted as excess personnel. A construction company’s first batch of optimization included 20 second- and third-line female workers. They were not convinced and went to the boss to reason with him. The boss asked in return: “Can you push bricks and mix cement? In the future, the second and third lines will need strong labor, and we don’t need embroidery girls.” The foreman of a lathe group in a certain factory had even more serious “male chauvinistic” thoughts, actually pushing out a female worker who was at the top of the production list and keeping a male worker who completed only two-thirds of the monthly quota of this female worker. The factory director asked the foreman for the reason. The foreman said: “She is 25 years old and will soon get married. After marriage, she will soon have children. With so many women, there will be a lot of trouble in the future. I am responsible for these 3 years. She is the heaviest burden. Who else should I get rid of if not her?”

	The authors reviewed the “list of excess personnel” gathered at the Western District Labor Market and found that many units had pushed out all-female personnel. If it is understandable that heavy labor units have more excess female workers, then it is puzzling that some enterprise departments’ typists and mail clerks also changed from female to male in the optimization process, which is inexplicable.

	Situation Four: Too many monks, not enough porridge. Little Liu from the Western District Repair Company Labor Market proudly introduced to the authors that the excess personnel included skilled workers in Chinese and English typing, home appliance repair, and lathe and milling machine operations, who had won praise from other units for their labor services. The authors were puzzled: why did so many talents become the abandoned children of the enterprise? “We don’t want them to wander and suffer,” they also do not want to “live separately,” but our temple can only accommodate 2,500 monks. Little Liu humorously revealed the secret of the excess personnel: “Due to the stoppage of ‘Yan’ brand bicycles, the bicycle parts factory established for matching was closed; the automobile assembly factory was not doing well and had to stop. The company was unable to convert production, and two teams of 500 workers were simultaneously pushed to the company’s labor market, waiting for the enterprise to find another way.”

	The authors’ impression: Labor optimization, as a reform of the employment system, is beneficial to stimulate workers’ competitive consciousness, maintain the vigor of the workforce, and thus improve the economic benefits of the enterprise. In this way, it is inevitable that some people will be separated from their positions. Many enterprises have a high degree of transparency in their optimization work, and most workers are satisfied. However, it is proven that “optimization” and “excess” can only be relative. At present, it is still difficult to avoid the obstacles of leadership quality, the influence of unhealthy tendencies, and the entanglement of interpersonal relationships. People should correctly treat excess personnel.

　　京都企业编余人员透视
　　王振良　赵剑平　颜世贵
    “干吗捡人家的包袱背？优化劳动组合，表现好能让单位拨拉下来吗？”某公司经理听说接收外单位编余人员从事临时性劳务，火冒三丈，不分青红皂白地把劳资科长撸了一顿。
    在这位经理的观念中，似乎有这样一个逻辑：编余——劣质——包袱——淘汰。
    其实，不能一概而论。在北京市目前开展优化劳动组合的２５００多个企业中，被列为编余人员的有７万多人。据笔者调查，他们当中有不少是技术不错、劳动态度端正的。那么，这些人又是怎样被企业列入另册的呢？
    情况之一：“得罪烧锅的，吃不着热豆腐”。在某厂组装车间的“编余人员花名册”上，不少人名的后面标有“闹号”的字样。何谓“闹号”？说穿了，领导认为他喜欢“闹”，或不尊重领导。
    一位工人气呼呼地告诉笔者：“我们的头死要面子，不许别人说个‘不’字。有一次他迟到了半小时，我给他提意见，没想到捅了蚂蜂窝，他当场指责我在群众面前降低领导威信，用心不良。这回，他把我编外了。”
    有个叫朱世萍的工人概括了他们车间张主任优化组合的原则：听他话的——组合；不顺他眼的——编余。小朱介绍说，优化工作刚开始，张主任就琢磨人选，他的哥们一个也不落，寻机建立感情的拉进来进一步培养。以实干闻名的朱世萍不会看领导眼色行事，所以在车间优化组合会上，张主任首先打了他“编余”的主意，造舆论说：“小朱虽然连续被评选为先进，但他缺点还是不少的……”
    “你是表扬我，还是批评我？”朱世萍关键时刻还“不识时务”地往枪口上撞。
    “怎么？老虎屁股摸不得，你也太趾高气扬啦！这个车间容不下你是不是？”张主任说着，当众在组合人员花名册上照准朱世萍的名字狠狠打了个×。
    笔者在某公司还听到这样一个故事：办公室主任将一抽屉饭票和一枚食堂专用章推到小陈跟前，亲切地说：“好好干，决不能出问题。”
    小陈面对这摊糊涂帐，为难地说：“这个饭票不清点办个手续我不能接，否则日后有麻烦。”
    “不愿干算啦，能卖饭票的人有的是，你一周内离开食堂！”
    小陈哭笑不得，把这一经过告诉主管经理，想求得他的同情和支持。可是主管经理竟说：“你们主任是我聘任的，你不服从他的领导就是不服从我的领导，请你不要挑拨我们领导之间的关系好不好？”
    自然，小陈的胳膊拧不过大腿……
    情况之二：“关系学”深入优化组合。有个事例很能说明问题。某厂有个小组７名工人，需要“编余”１个。掌握生杀大权的组长盘算开了：这７个人除了自己，有１个是厂领导的表亲，当然在优化组合之列；有２个是公司副经理介绍来的，得罪不起；有２个是自己的哥们，“优化”前就拍过胸脯。对不起，非小杨不行了。
    情况之三：“阴衰阳盛”。女工由于众所周知的原因，在某些企业里首当其冲成为“编余”的靶子。有个建筑公司优化组合第一批就“刷”下来２０个二三线的女工。她们不服气，找头头说理。头头反问：“你们能推砖拌灰吗？以后二三线要充实壮劳力，不需要绣花小姐。”某厂车床组组长“重男轻女”思想更严重，竟然将产量名列前茅的一个女工推出了优化圈，宁愿留下一个完成月定额不及这位女工２／３的男工。厂长问组长道理何在？组长说：“她２５岁了，马上就要结婚，婚后接着就该生孩子，婆婆妈妈的，往后罗嗦事多了，３年别想消停，我承包这３年，她是最重的包袱，不甩她甩谁？”
    笔者查看了西城区劳务市场汇集的《编余人员花名册》，发现许多单位推出来的是青一色的女性。如果说重体力单位多编余些女工还情有可原的话，那么令人费解的是，一些企业科室的打字员、收发员也在优化组合中由女变男，就莫明其妙了。
    情况之四：僧多粥少。西城区修理公司劳务市场小刘自豪地向笔者介绍说，编余人员中，中英文打字、家电维修、车钳铣刨专业的生产骨干应有尽有，在外单位从事劳务赢得了一片赞扬。笔者纳闷：这么多人才为何成了企业的弃儿？“我们不舍得他们流离颠沛”，他们也不乐意‘离群索居’，但我们这个庙只能容下２５００个僧”。小刘风趣地端出了编余人员的老底：“由于‘燕牌’自行车停产，当初配套成立的自行车零件厂随之倒闭；汽车装置厂经营不景气，也被迫下马。公司无能转产，齐刷刷的两支拥有５００名职工的队伍，只好同时被推到公司劳务市场，等待企业另辟生路。”
    笔者印象：劳动优化组合，作为用工制度的变革，有利于激发职工的竞争意识，保持职工队伍的旺盛活力，从而提高企业的经济效益。这样，必然有一部分人从岗位上剥离下来。许多企业在优化工作中，透明度较高，多数工人是满意的。但事实证明，“组合”与“编外”只能相对而言。在目前，还难以避开领导素质的阻碍、不正之风的影响和人际关系的困扰。人们应该正确对待编余人员。
