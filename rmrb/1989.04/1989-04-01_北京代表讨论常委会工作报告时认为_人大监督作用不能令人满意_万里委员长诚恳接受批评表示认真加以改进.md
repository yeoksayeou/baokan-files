Beijing delegates discussed the work report of the Standing Committee, believing that the supervisory role of the People's Congress is unsatisfactory. Chairman Wan Li sincerely accepts the criticism and expresses his intention to make improvements.

Beijing, March 31 (Xinhua) — Reporter Fei Weiwei: In the past year, the government made significant mistakes in decision-making. The National People's Congress Standing Committee, which is responsible for exercising supervisory powers, bears a heavy responsibility. However, the work report of the Standing Committee did not admit these mistakes as frankly as Premier Li Peng's report. Therefore, the work and report of the Standing Committee are unsatisfactory.

This morning, at a joint meeting of the Beijing delegation to the National People's Congress, which included Chairman Wan Li of the Standing Committee, some delegates made sharp criticisms of the Standing Committee during the discussion.

Deputy Liu Deqian said in his speech that it should be acknowledged that the Standing Committee has made significant improvements in supervising the government's work in recent years. However, compared to the powers granted by the state and the constitution, it still falls far short. He suggested strengthening the organization of the special committees. Currently, the focus should be on strengthening the economic, population, and education special committees. At the same time, the special committees should proactively review and supervise important policies issued by the government.

Deputy Cao Fengguo said that after the Beidaihe meeting last year, prices soared in various places. The People's Congress should have convened an emergency meeting to proactively supervise the government and urge it to take emergency measures to stabilize prices. He hopes that the Standing Committee will supervise in advance, identify problems, and make decisions in a timely manner, rather than discussing them afterward.

Delegates in their speeches acknowledged the achievements of the Standing Committee in legislative work, but generally felt that legislative work still lags behind the demands of the situation. Deputy Chen Dingmao believes that in recent years, the excessive issuance of currency and price increases are partly due to the fact that the People's Congress's legislative work has not kept up and has not timely formulated the "Banking Law."

Deputy Xiong Ming pointed out in his speech that the population growth rate has been rising again in recent years, seriously affecting the development of the country and the nation. He called for the prompt formulation of a more stringent family planning law.

Deputy Fu Lan demanded that the Standing Committee exercise its supervisory powers to urge the State Education Commission to respond to the dates for the issuance of the "Education Law" and the "Teacher Law," so as to supervise and inspect. Otherwise, every session of the People's Congress will call for it, year after year, with no results.

How can the supervisory role of the Standing Committee be strengthened? Delegates also made some constructive suggestions. Many delegates believe that deputies to the People's Congress need training, and members of the Standing Committee should also be trained. Some delegates suggested that the special committees of the People's Congress can, outside the scope of deputies to the People's Congress, hire some experienced personnel from retired government officials and other relevant personnel to enhance the authority of the special committees' supervision.

Chairman Wan Li listened to the delegates' opinions and frankly admitted that he had not supervised well, saying that he was "negligent." He welcomed and thanked the delegates for their criticisms, saying, "Criticism is a promotion for the work of the Standing Committee."

Wan Li said that he came today to seek advice from the delegates on how to exercise the supervisory role of the People's Congress under the unified leadership of the Party. He hopes that Beijing will practice this seriously, create experience, and solve this problem, both to exercise the supervisory role of the People's Congress and to handle the relationship with the Party and the government.

　　北京代表讨论常委会工作报告时认为
    人大监督作用不能令人满意
    万里委员长诚恳接受批评表示认真加以改进
    本报北京３月３１日讯  记者费伟伟报道：去年一年里政府在决策方面出现重大失误，行使监督职权的全国人大常委会负有重大责任，对此，常委会的工作报告未能像李鹏总理的报告一样坦率承认失误，因此，人大常委会工作和报告都不能令人满意。
    今天上午，在有全国人大常委会委员长万里参加的人大北京团的联组会上，部分代表在讨论中对人大常委会提出上述尖锐批评。
    刘德鉁代表在发言中说，应该肯定人大常委会近几年在对政府工作监督方面有很大改进，但是，与国家和宪法赋予人大的这种职权相比还差甚远。他建议，对专门委员会在组织上给予加强。当前首先重点加强经济、人口、教育三个专门委员会。同时对政府出台的重要政策，专门委员会应该主动进行论证，实行监督。
    曹凤国代表说，去年北戴河会议后，各地物价暴涨，人大应该召集紧急会议，对政府主动监督，促使政府采取紧急措施平抑物价。他希望人大常委会监督在前，发现问题，及时作出决议，不要事后再讨论。
    代表们在发言中肯定了人大常委会在立法工作方面的成绩，但普遍认为，立法工作仍然跟不上形势要求。陈丁茂代表认为，近几年货币发行过多。物价上涨，原因之一就是人大的立法工作没跟上，没有及时制订《银行法》。
    熊明代表在发言中指出，近几年人口增长率又在回升，严重影响了国家和民族的发展。他呼吁尽快制定更加严格的计划生育法。
    符兰代表要求人大常委会行使监督权力，促使国家教委表态答复《教育法》和《教师法》出台的日期，以便监督检查。否则，每次人代会都呼吁，年年喊，年年无影。
    如何才能增强人大常委会的议政能力，实行有效监督？代表们也提出了一些建设性建议。不少代表认为，人大代表需要培训，对人大常委会委员也应该进行培训。有的代表认为，人大各专门委员会可以在人大代表范围外，从离职的政府官员和其他有关人士中聘请部分有经验的工作人员，提高专门委员会监督的权威性。
    万里委员长听取了代表们的意见后坦率承认，自己没有监督好，可以说是“失职”。他对代表们的批评表示欢迎和感谢，“批评对人大常委会的工作是一个促进”，他说。
    万里表示，今天是带着怎样在党的统一领导下发挥人大的监督作用这个问题来向代表们请教的。他希望北京在这方面认真实践，创造经验，解决好这个问题，既发挥人大的监督作用，同时又能处理好与党、与政府的关系。
