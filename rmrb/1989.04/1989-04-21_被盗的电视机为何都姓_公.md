Title: Why Stolen Televisions All Have the Surname "Public"

From March 1 to 11, our city's public security bureau consecutively cracked several cases of television theft, recovering five color televisions and two black-and-white televisions, valued at over 16,000 yuan. It is worth pondering that none of these televisions were privately owned. The main reason is that everyone does not cherish televisions with the surname "public." Some units place televisions in cultural rooms or dining halls without supervision. For example, the Lianyuan City Phosphorus Fertilizer Factory in Lianyuan City, Loudi Region, had previously had one color television stolen, but this did not alert the factory's leaders. On the night of February 2, this factory had another color television stolen.

During the Spring Festival this year, a wave of television theft swept through our city, targeting various units. On January 20, the Loudi City Public Security Bureau issued an emergency notice, reminding various units to do a good job in security and protection. The security personnel of the Loudi Color Cement Factory specifically found the television manager in the factory, asking her to manage the color televisions well during the Spring Festival. However, that manager did not take it seriously, resulting in criminals climbing up to steal the television.

### 被盗的电视机为何都姓“公”

　　被盗的电视机为何都姓“公”
    今年３月１日至１１日，我市公安局接连破获几起盗窃彩电案，追缴回彩色电视机５台、黑白电视机２台，价值１６０００多元。值得深思的是，这些电视机没有１台是私人的。究其原因，主要是大家都不爱护姓“公”的电视机。有的单位将电视机放在文化室或餐厅里无人照看。例如，地处我市的娄底地区涟源市磷肥厂以前已被盗走了１台彩电，但没有引起厂领导人的警惕。今年２月２日夜，这个厂又被盗走了１台彩电。
    今年春节前后，我市刮起了一股偷彩电风，作案对象是各个单位。１月２０日，市公安局下达紧急通知，告诫各单位做好安全保卫工作。娄底彩色水泥厂的保卫人员专门找到厂里的电视机管理员，让她在春节期间管理好彩电。但是，那位管理员不以为然，结果不法分子爬上楼偷走了彩电。
