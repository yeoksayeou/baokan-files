Last winter, a peddler named Chen from Ma'anshan, Anhui, bought hundreds of substandard duck-down comforters from another province, with a down content of only 0.25%. After dressing them up as imported goods, they were transformed into high-end "Meida" brand products from Shanghai. In just three days, more than 100 consumers were deceived.

Such incidents of harming consumers are not uncommon. In recent years, the influx of substandard goods into the market has been increasingly severe, deceiving consumers. Fake liquor, fake pesticides, fake fertilizers, fake seeds, substandard electrical appliances, daily necessities, food, and other items are varied and highly harmful. Fake pesticides produced by some enterprises in Jintan County, Jiangsu, caused 46,000 mu of crops in Hebei and Shandong provinces to fail. Fake seeds sold by some supply and marketing cooperatives in Huayin County, Shaanxi, affected 200,000 households. Substandard fertilizers produced in Zhengzhou and other places caused 45,000 mu of wheat seedlings in Puyang City to wither, leading to crop failure and leaving farmers destitute and crying in despair...

Where do these substandard goods come from? Stores blame the wholesale departments, wholesale departments blame the factories, and factories blame the cooperating factories. In reality, substandard goods have producers and sellers. To protect consumers' interests, we must identify those involved in the production and sale of substandard goods.

To investigate substandard goods, strengthening the supervision and inspection of product quality is a crucial step. To achieve this, we must block the sources and cut off the distribution channels. First, we should start with substandard goods that have entered the market, trace them back to their manufacturing plants and workshops. Second, we should focus on the sales channels, identify the stores and stalls selling substandard goods, and force them to stop selling, destroy, or confiscate these goods. We should also strengthen the inspection of wholesale departments and other links to cut off the intermediate distribution channels for substandard goods.

However, relying on these two measures alone is not enough to eradicate the problem. We must also wield the sword of the law. As the ancients said, "The world does not lack laws, but it lacks laws that are strictly enforced." Currently, the penalties for producing and selling substandard goods are too light, and the deterrent effect is not strong. As a result, those who make mistakes find it difficult to establish a sense of law; those who break the law often do not know they are wrong and do not repent. Some people take risks, saying, "Commit big crimes to make big money, commit small crimes to make small money, and commit no crimes to make no money." This from another perspective illustrates the importance of strictly enforcing the law. We must strictly enforce the law, punish those who violate criminal laws according to the law, and show no leniency. For those who openly condone, support, and shelter illegal activities, regardless of who they are, we must hold them accountable and deal with them seriously.

　　不能让伪劣商品坑害人
    纪半华
    去年冬天，安徽马鞍山市商贩陈某从外省购进数百条劣质鸭绒被，含绒量仅０．２５％。但经他侨装打扮之后，摇身变成了上海“美达生”牌高级外销产品。仅３天时间，就使１００多位消费者受骗上当。
    这类坑害消费者的事例，并不鲜见。近年来伪劣商品流入市场，坑害消费者愈演愈烈。假名酒、假农药、假化肥、假种子，劣质电器、日用品、食品等，五花八门，危害甚烈。江苏金坛县一些企业生产的假农药使冀鲁二省４．６万亩绝产。陕西华阴县一些供销社出售假种子，使２０万户农户遭殃。郑州等地生产的劣质化肥，使濮阳市４．５万亩麦苗夭折，麦农绝收，生活无着，坐在地头抱头痛哭……
    伪劣商品从何而来？商店推批发部门，批发部门说找工厂去，工厂则推给协作厂。实际上，伪劣商品产有主，销有店。要保护消费者利益，就得把参与伪劣商品产、销的人查出来。
    要查伪劣商品，加强商品质量监督检查是重要的一着。要做到对伪劣商品道道设卡，关关堵截，我以为要一断其源，二断其流。首先从流入市场的伪劣商品下手，顺藤摸瓜，直捣它的制造厂和有关作坊；其二，从销售渠道下手，查出伪劣商品在各地的销售店、摊，强制停止出售，销毁或没收伪劣商品，并且加强对批发部门等环节的检查，切断销售伪劣商品的中间流通渠道。
    但光凭二断，仍不能根治，还应拿起法的宝剑。古人曰：“世不患无法，而患无必行之法。”目前，对生产和经销伪劣商品者，惩处偏轻，威慑不大。以致，有错者难于建立法的意识；犯法者，多不知罪悔改。有些人铤而走险，说：“犯大法赚大钱，犯小法赚小钱，不犯法不赚钱。”这从另一个侧面说明严肃法纪的重要意义。严肃法纪，对触犯刑律的要依法惩办，决不姑息；对那些公开纵容、支持和庇护违法活动的干部，不管是谁，都应追究责任，严肃处理。
