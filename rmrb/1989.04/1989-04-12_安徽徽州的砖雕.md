Brick carvings, as a form of architectural decoration, have a long history from ancient times to the present, and can be found from south to north, from official buildings to residential homes. However, the richness and variety, as well as the exquisite and lively nature of the brick carvings in the Huizhou region of Anhui, are truly rare. Every residential building in southern Anhui is adorned with vividly shaped and beautifully patterned brick carvings. On bricks that are only an inch thick, figures are carved with lifelike expressions and delicate details, as well as vivid birds, beasts, fish, and insects, magnificent landscapes, and competing flowers. Everything is arranged harmoniously.

The themes of Huizhou brick carvings are rich and varied, with a wide range of subjects. There are stories from operas, folk customs, myths and legends, natural scenery, religious ceremonies, and scenes from daily life, among many others. Brick carvings with themes of birds, beasts, flowers, and plants are commonly seen, such as the "Four Gentlemen" (plum, orchid, bamboo, and chrysanthemum). Among the beasts, the lion, known for its strength and majesty, is the most frequently depicted. These brick carving works not only have artistic research and appreciation value but also reflect the aesthetic tastes and folk customs of the Ming and Qing dynasties.

Comparing the numerous brick carvings in the She County area, we can clearly see the changes and development in their artistic style and expression methods. The brick carvings of the Ming Dynasty in Huizhou are rough and simple, with a natural and pure style. The carving techniques generally use single carving or shallow round carving, and rely on traditional line carving techniques. The compositions are strict and symmetrical, emphasizing the overall impression and not being overly concerned with detailed carving. They have high aesthetic value. In the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, the New Anhui School of painting emerged, followed by the flourishing of the printing industry. Huizhou woodblock prints in the fields of novels, songbooks, illustrations, ink gardens, painting albums, letter albums, and flower paper and New Year pictures shone brightly, greatly influencing architectural decorative art. At the same time, due to the increasing pursuit of luxurious and extravagant lifestyles by wealthy merchants, the style of brick carvings in the Qing Dynasty gradually became more complex, emphasizing plot and composition, neglecting the overall layout and atmosphere, and transitioning from romantic realism to pure realism. During this period, many finely carved works appeared, but some were overly meticulous and lacked artistic integrity, deviating from the logic of architecture and lowering the artistic quality of architectural decorative carvings, thus losing their unique folk art beauty.

　　安徽徽州的砖雕
　　陶原
    砖雕，作为建筑艺术的一种装饰手段，从古到今，源远流长，从南到北，从官式建筑到民居，并不鲜见。但如安徽徽州地区砖雕如此之丰富多采、精美生动的，实属罕见。皖南民居无一不镶嵌着造型生动、图案优美的砖雕，在厚度不过寸余的青砖上镂刻着神态逼真、细腻的人物，栩栩如生的鸟兽鱼虫，蔚为壮观的山水，争奇斗妍的花卉，安排有致。
    徽州砖雕表达的内容十分丰富，选材广泛，戏曲故事，民间风情，神话传说，自然风物，宗教仪式，生活场景，不胜枚举。以大量的飞禽走兽，花卉草木为题材的砖雕，常见的有“梅兰竹菊”四君子，走兽中犹以雄健威猛的狮子图案最多。这些砖雕作品，不仅具有艺术上的研究和欣赏价值，还能反映明、清民间审美情趣、民俗风情。
    比较歙县境内众多的砖雕，我们可以清楚地发现它的艺术风格和表现手法变化、发展的轨迹。明代徽州砖雕风格粗犷，稚拙朴实，淳厚自然，刀刻手法一般为单雕或浅圆雕，并借助于传统的线刻手法，构图严谨、对称，强调总体感受，不拘泥于细节刻画，有较高的美学价值。明末清初，新安画派兴起，稍后印刷业的兴盛，徽派木刻版画在小说、唱本、插图、墨苑、画谱、笺谱以及花纸和年画领域大放异彩，给建筑装饰艺术以极大的影响。同时，由于富商对奢华绮糜生活的愈加追求，清代砖雕的风格渐趋繁杂，注重情节和构图，忽视总体布局和意境的经营，从浪漫的写实逐渐过渡到纯粹的写实。这一时期出现了许多精雕细镂的作品，但有些未免匠气，繁琐，有违建筑逻辑，降低了建筑装饰雕刻的艺术品格，从而失掉了其特有的民间艺术的美。
