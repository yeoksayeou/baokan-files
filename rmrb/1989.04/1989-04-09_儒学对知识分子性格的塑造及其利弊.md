	Confucianism has significantly influenced the fundamental personality traits of Chinese intellectuals (including scholar-officials). The political integrity, moral cultivation, lifestyle habits, thinking patterns, and academic styles of Chinese intellectuals can all be seen as bearing the imprint of Confucianism.

	The political principle of "when the world is governed by the Way, one appears; when the world is not governed by the Way, one retreats" proposed by Confucianism, while having an aspect of adhering to principles and resisting despotic tyranny, is ultimately a passive resistance with a clear tendency to avoid evil and preserve oneself. This is the theoretical root of the weak personality and even political opportunism of Confucian intellectuals. The moral philosophy of Confucianism is essentially ethical absolutism, overly emphasizing personal social obligations while neglecting personal rights. This can easily be exploited by despotic rulers, becoming a moral shackle that suppresses the normal development and reasonable needs of human nature. It also has a distorting effect on the personality of intellectuals, making them tools of the despotic regime under the moral obligation to maintain the "Five Relationships" order. This is also an important reason why Chinese intellectuals lack a collective self-awareness of criticism.

	The epistemology of Confucianism, while emphasizing "extensive learning, careful inquiry, and prudent reflection," does not exclude the pursuit and mastery of natural scientific knowledge. However, it is essentially a moral rationality rather than a scientific rationality. The knowledge and learning it values are mainly humanities-related political and moral knowledge, with the primary purpose of learning being to "cultivate oneself and govern others," and to "bring order to the world." Therefore, it has created a tradition among intellectuals of valuing benevolence and righteousness over practical benefits, and humanities over science, resulting in a one-sided knowledge structure. This inevitably hinders the popularization and advancement of scientific knowledge and is one of the reasons why Chinese intellectuals struggle to form a scientific community, contributing to China's technological backwardness.

### 儒学对知识分子性格的塑造及其利弊

　　儒学对知识分子性格的塑造及其利弊
    吴光在《天津社会科学》１９８９年第１期上撰文指出，中国古代的士——知识分子创造了儒学，而儒学也对中国知识分子（包括士大夫）基本性格的形成起了巨大影响。中国知识分子的政治操守、道德修养、生活习俗、思维方式、学术风格等方面，可以说无不打上儒学的烙印。
    儒学提出的“天下有道则见，无道则隐”的政治去就原则，固然有守道不移、抵制专制淫威的一面，但毕竟是消极的抵制，有着明显的回避邪恶、明哲保身的倾向。这是造成儒家知识分子软弱性格甚至是政治投机主义的理论根源。儒学的道德哲学实质上是伦理本位主义，过分强调个人的社会义务而忽视个人的权利，这很容易被专制统治者所利用，而成为压制人性正常发展和合理需要的道德桎梏。其对知识分子的性格，也具有扭曲的作用，使知识分子在维持“五伦”秩序的道德义务下成为专制政权的工具。这也正是中国知识分子缺乏群体批判的自我意识的一个重要原因。儒家的知识论，尽管也强调“博学，审问，慎思”，并不排斥对自然科学知识的追求和掌握，但它从本质上说是一种道德知性而非科学知性，它所重视的知识和学问，主要是有关政治、道德的人文知识，其学习目的主要是为了“修己治人”、“平治天下”。因而在知识分子中造成了一种重仁义、轻功利，重人文、轻科学的传统性格及片面的知识结构。这势必妨碍科学知识的普及和提高，也是中国知识分子难以形成科学群体，造成中国科技落后的一个原因。
