Beijing flights to directly fly to Frankfurt

	According to a reporter from the People's Daily, Xu Jianzhong, from China International Airlines, it is learned that the three flights between Beijing and Frankfurt, West Germany, which operate on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, will change to direct flights starting from May 2. The 8,500-kilometer journey will take only 10 hours to reach the destination.

	The change to direct flights means that the aircraft will fly from Beijing, over the skies of the Soviet Union's Siberia, directly to Frankfurt without any intermediate stops for refueling. This will shorten the flight time by 5 hours.
