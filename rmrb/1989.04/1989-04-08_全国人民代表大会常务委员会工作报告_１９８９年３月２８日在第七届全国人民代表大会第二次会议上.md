Report on the Work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress
— March 28, 1989, at the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress

Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Peng Chong:

Comrades and Deputies,

I am reporting to the Congress on behalf of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress on the work of the Standing Committee since the First Session.

Over the past year, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, in accordance with the powers granted by the Constitution, has followed the requirements of the resolution on the work report of the Standing Committee adopted by the First Session of the Seventh National People's Congress. It has improved and strengthened its work in various aspects, achieving new progress in developing socialist democracy, improving socialist legal system, and promoting modernization construction and reform and opening up.

I. Improvements in the Work of the Standing Committee

The Standing Committee of this National People's Congress is performing its duties in an important period of socialist construction and reform and opening up in our country. To adapt to this overall situation, the Standing Committee has, based on the spirit of democracy, openness, and pragmatism, made several improvements in its work on the basis of the previous session. The main improvements are as follows:

(1) Formulation of the work guidelines for this Standing Committee. These "guidelines" further clarified the guiding ideology of the Standing Committee's work, which is to adhere to the Constitution and the spirit of the Thirteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, to be guided by the theory of the primary stage of socialism, to adhere to one central task and two basic points, to ensure and promote reform and opening up as the primary responsibility, to strengthen the construction of socialist democracy and legal system as the central task, to place the strengthening of its own construction in an important position, to closely combine with the actual situation, and to actively carry out work. This will create a stable, united, democratic, and harmonious environment for the smooth progress of socialist modernization construction and reform and opening up. The "guidelines" have made plans for legislative and supervisory work in the next five years, improved the planned nature of the Standing Committee's work, facilitated the institutionalization of the Standing Committee's work, and also made it easier for the National People's Congress deputies and the people of the whole country to understand and supervise the work of the Standing Committee.

(2) Further playing the role of specialized committees. The members of this Standing Committee are 74% members of specialized committees, which is an important measure to strengthen the work of the Standing Committee and specialized committees. Over the past year, various specialized committees have actively carried out investigations and research around the bills to be deliberated and the legislative and supervisory work of the Standing Committee, and have done a lot of work. The 94 bills assigned by the Presidium of the First Session of the Seventh National People's Congress to various specialized committees for deliberation have been deliberated one by one, and the reports on the results of the deliberations have been submitted to the Standing Committee for approval. Specialized committees have strengthened the drafting and deliberation of bills, actively contacted relevant departments, understood the drafting situation of laws, and prepared for the deliberation of draft laws; often listened to the work reports of relevant departments, and checked the implementation of some laws. Various specialized committees have played an important role in assisting the Standing Committee in legislation and supervision.

(3) Strengthening the connection with the National People's Congress deputies, local people's congresses, and the people. In order to make the laws formulated by the Standing Committee and the decisions made more in line with the actual situation and more in line with the wishes and requirements of the people, and also to make the Standing Committee better accept the supervision of deputies and the people, the Standing Committee pays attention to widely soliciting opinions and suggestions from all sides when deliberating and deciding on major issues. Over the past year, the members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress have gone to various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities to investigate and inspect, understand the actual situation, and listen to the opinions of the people. The Chairman, Vice Chairmen, and relevant committees have held several thematic seminars to listen to the opinions of experts and practical workers. The Standing Committee invites some National People's Congress deputies to attend the meetings and participate in the discussions whenever it holds a meeting, which is very helpful for the deliberation and decision-making of issues. The Standing Committee has set up a reception room for National People's Congress deputies. The Office of the Standing Committee and relevant departments have promptly handled and replied to the suggestions, criticisms, and opinions submitted by deputies through various channels. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress regards strengthening the connection with the Standing Committees of local people's congresses as an important work, in addition to continuing to insist on inviting the leaders of the Standing Committees of various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities to attend the meetings of the Standing Committee, it also exchanges situations and experiences with the Standing Committees of local people's congresses through various seminars and other means, especially the work of soliciting opinions on draft laws and contacting deputies, which are entrusted to them for assistance. Local people's congresses have done a lot of work in this regard, which is a great support to us. Doing a good job in handling letters and visits is an important channel for understanding and reflecting the will and demands of the people. Last year, nearly 120,000 letters from the people were received; from the end of October last year to February this year, more than 8,100 people were received. After serious handling, a number of problems that the masses urgently need to solve have been solved.

(4) Improving the openness of the Standing Committee's work. The Standing Committee has been exploring and gradually establishing some institutions and methods to improve openness. Since the second meeting of the Standing Committee, a press conference has been held before each meeting to introduce the draft agenda to be submitted to the meeting and the arrangements for the meeting to the domestic and foreign press, and to make the relevant contents of the meeting public through the media. When reporting on the situation of deputies deliberating bills, attention is paid to reflecting various opinions. The Standing Committee meeting has set up a spectator's seat and invited people from trade unions, women's federations, and the Communist Youth League and other mass organizations to listen to the meeting. Some important draft laws, such as the draft Administrative Litigation Law and the draft Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, have also been published in full in newspapers and widely solicited opinions throughout the country. This is conducive to carrying forward socialist democracy, concentrating the wisdom of the masses, and making the laws more perfect.

(5) Improving foreign affairs work. The foreign affairs work of the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee is an important part of China's overall diplomatic work. The Standing Committee has strengthened the unified planning of foreign affairs work, carried out parliamentary diplomacy in an organized manner, and, based on the principles of economy, simplicity, and courtesy, has made some reforms in the protocol work. In 1988, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, various specialized committees, and the office of the Standing Committee sent a total of 11 delegations to visit 18 countries and the European Parliament, participated in 4 international conferences, and received delegations from 30 countries and the European Parliament. Through exchanges, friendship and understanding between each other have been enhanced, friendly relations with the parliaments of these countries have been strengthened, and the development of state relations has been promoted. In response to the interference of the U.S. Senate and the European Parliament in China's internal affairs, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress issued a statement condemning it, expressing our solemn position, and winning the support and support of the people of the whole country.

(6) Establishing and improving work systems. In order to make the work of the Standing Committee procedural and institutionalized, the Standing Committee has placed the construction of work systems in an important position. The Chairman's Meeting, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Constitution and the Law on the Organization of the National People's Congress, has formulated the Rules of Procedure, which clearly stipulates the procedures for the Chairman's Meeting to discuss and decide on issues and the handling of documents. The work rules formulated by various specialized committees have made specific provisions on the responsibilities, organizational structure, meeting system, and work methods of the committee. The office of the Standing Committee has also further established and improved the work system, improving work efficiency.

II. Strengthening Legislative Work and Supervision of Law Implementation

In order to gradually establish a new order for socialist commodity economy and use legal means to ensure the smooth progress of modernization construction and reform and opening up, the Standing Committee has been working hard on the formulation of laws and the amendment of existing laws. Over the past year, the Standing Committee has adopted 13 laws and relevant decisions on laws. This is another batch of achievements in China's legislative work. The decision on amending the Land Management Law, in accordance with the provisions on land in the constitutional amendment adopted by the First Session of the Seventh National People's Congress, has amended and supplemented the provisions on the land use system in the Land Management Law. This is of great significance for improving the national land management system and fully and reasonably utilizing land. The Standardization Law and the Law on the Inspection of Import and Export Commodities will play a powerful role in promoting technological progress, improving product quality, and developing foreign trade and economic and technological cooperation. In accordance with the needs of national construction, the Law on the Protection of State Secrets, the Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, and the Law on the Protection of Wildlife have also been formulated. The Regulations on the Rank of Officers and the Regulations on the Service of Active Officers will be beneficial to strengthening the command, management, and modernization and regularization of the army.

The draft Administrative Litigation Law and the draft Rules of Procedure of the National People's Congress submitted to this Congress for deliberation are two important draft laws that the Standing Committee has been working on and repeatedly deliberating. The Administrative Litigation Law is a basic law of equal importance to the Criminal Procedure Law and the Civil Procedure Law. Its formulation and implementation will further protect the legal rights and interests of citizens and organizations, maintain and supervise the lawful exercise of administrative power, promote clean governance, and improve work efficiency. The Rules of Procedure of the National People's Congress is a procedural law for the highest state power organ to exercise its powers. Its formulation and implementation will be conducive to further carrying forward democracy and improving the efficiency of deliberations, marking a step forward in the institutionalization and legalization of the work of the National People's Congress.

After more than three years of efforts, the drafting of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has been completed. The Standing Committee has preliminarily deliberated and decided to publish it. After further soliciting opinions and amending it, it will be submitted to the Third Session of the Seventh National People's Congress for approval next year.

According to the work guidelines of this Standing Committee, specific arrangements have been made for legislative work. In the next two years, the focus will be on formulating laws related to rectification and deepening reform, such as the Price Management Law, Budget Law, Banking Law, Company Law, Private Enterprise Law, Anti-Unfair Competition Law, etc. Laws related to the protection of citizens' rights and the maintenance of public order, such as the Press Law, Publication Law, Association Law, Assembly, Procession, and Demonstration Law, etc., should also be formulated. Laws related to education and science and technology, such as the Education Law and the Teacher Law, should also be formulated. Some of the above arrangements can be completed in the next two years, while some will take a longer time and need to be started early and the investigation and drafting work should be carried out. Most of the draft laws are proposed by the State Council. In order to speed up the legislative process, the State Council has made arrangements, and various specialized committees are strengthening their contact with relevant departments. Experts from scientific research and teaching institutions will also be organized to participate in the drafting of laws. The formulation of relevant laws to regulate commodity economic relations can be combined with China's actual situation to learn from some foreign laws, and some can be formulated as administrative regulations or local regulations first. The legislative procedures should also be summarized and improved.

A prominent problem in the current rule of law construction is that some laws that have been formulated have not been well implemented. The reasons for this situation are multifaceted and comprehensive measures need to be taken to solve it. All levels of people's congresses, governments, courts, and procuratorates have the important responsibility to ensure the implementation of the Constitution and laws. An important power of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress is to supervise the implementation of the Constitution. Over the past year, the Standing Committee has done some work in supporting and supervising relevant local and departmental units to correct behaviors that violate the Constitution and laws, but it still needs to be further improved and strengthened. In addition to examining the local regulations filed with the Standing Committee, various specialized committees have also conducted investigations and research on the implementation of laws such as the Law on Regional Autonomy for National Minorities, the Law on Industrial Enterprises, the Compulsory Education Law, the Law on the Protection of Cultural Relics, the Law on the Protection of Grasslands, the Patent Law, the Drug Administration Law, and the Food Hygiene Law (Trial), listened to the reports of relevant departments, and put forward problems and opinions that need to be solved in law enforcement. It must be pointed out that in the rectification and rectification, how to fully use the relevant laws to combat serious economic crimes, and how to fully implement the Law on Industrial Enterprises, these problems have not been solved well. The Criminal Law and the Decision on Severely Punishing Serious Economic Criminals adopted by the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee, the two supplementary regulations on the punishment of smuggling crimes and the punishment of bribery and corruption crimes, and other laws provide powerful legal weapons for rectification and rectification, ensuring clean governance. However, these laws have not been seriously implemented in some departments and localities, and there are serious problems such as not enforcing the law, not strictly enforcing the law, weak investigation and punishment, replacing criminal punishment with administrative penalties, and replacing the law with words. The masses have strong opinions about this. Economic criminal activities must be severely punished in accordance with the law, and the situation of weak crackdown must be resolutely corrected. The Enterprise Law adopted by the Seventh National People's Congress is the basic law on China's state-owned industrial enterprises, but it is currently difficult to implement, mainly because the rights of enterprises as independent legal persons are not properly guaranteed; the mechanism to restrain the behavior of enterprises is also very imperfect. Deepening enterprise reform must focus on the implementation of the Enterprise Law and promptly formulate laws and regulations that match the Enterprise Law. This is an important link that cannot be ignored in promoting the overall reform of China's economic system. The Law on Regional Autonomy for National Minorities is the basic law for implementing the constitutional provisions on regional autonomy for national minorities. Each autonomous region should promptly formulate autonomous regulations. In the future, the Standing Committee will further strengthen the supervision of the implementation of the Constitution and laws: examine administrative regulations and local regulations; listen to the reports of the State Council and its relevant departments, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate on the implementation of laws; selectively inspect the implementation of some important laws; and urge relevant departments to seriously correct constitutional and legal violations.

In order to change the situation of not enforcing the law, not strictly enforcing the law, and not investigating violations of the law, it is also necessary to strengthen the legal awareness of cadres and the masses and learn to use legal weapons to fight against all behaviors that violate the Constitution and laws. To this end, it is necessary to continue to do a good job in popularizing legal knowledge. The Standing Committee has listened to the report of the Ministry of Justice on the situation of legal education again, affirmed the achievements of legal education, pointed out that this is a long-term and arduous task, and should be firmly grasped.

III. Strengthening Work Supervision and Supporting Rectification and Rectification

At the First Session of the Seventh National People's Congress, the deputies reflected the problems that the people generally care about in the aspects of prices, wages, agriculture, education, social order, and so on. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to this, and the State Council has established a special group to conduct investigations and research and brew solutions. The Third Session of the Standing Committee listened to the report of Vice Premier Yao Yilin on the preliminary plan for price and wage reform. The Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee analyzed the national situation and timely determined the guiding principles of rectifying the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and comprehensively deepening the reform. In order to support and promote the implementation of these guiding principles, the Fourth Session of the Standing Committee adopted the "Decision on Strengthening Democracy and Legal System, Maintaining Stability and Unity, and Ensuring the Smooth Progress of Reform and Construction," pointing out that socialist democracy should be further developed, socialist legal system should be strengthened, and the political situation of stability and unity should be consolidated and developed. The nation should be mobilized to closely unite around the Communist Party of China, work together, work hard, and actively participate in the work of rectification and rectification. The Fifth Session of the Standing Committee listened to the report of Vice Premier Yao Yilin on the current economic situation and the arrangement of the 1989 plan. The deputies believe that the State Council has done a lot of work for rectification and rectification, and has achieved initial results, but it is still necessary to continue to take effective measures to resolutely curb the phenomena of excessive demand, overheating economy, and rapid price increases, and strive to basically achieve the goal of rectification and rectification in two years or a longer period.

The Standing Committee also listened to the reports of relevant departments of the State Council on agriculture, education, social order, cultural relics protection, and work related to Taiwan. These reports not only talked about achievements but also reported the shortcomings and main problems in the work, and put forward measures for improvement in the future. The deputies expressed basic satisfaction. At the same time, everyone, in the spirit of being responsible to the people, affirmed what should be affirmed and criticized what should be criticized, and put forward some opinions and suggestions with pertinence. For example, many deputies pointed out that China's agriculture, especially grain production, although it reached a new level in 1984, has been stagnant for the next four years, which must be seriously noted. The strategic position of China's agriculture must be deeply understood, and efforts must be made to solve the problems of insufficient agricultural investment, high prices of agricultural production materials, and unreasonable prices of agricultural products, so as to improve the conditions for agricultural production, improve the scientific and technological level of agriculture, and promote the development of agricultural production. Many deputies emphasized that it is necessary to put the revitalization of education and the development of science and technology in a prominent and important position in modernization construction, and to solve the problems and difficulties existing in the aspects of cognition, system, and funds. The deputies also pointed out that the serious problems that have emerged in social order and social atmosphere must be highly valued, and comprehensive measures must be taken to govern them, further strengthen the construction of socialist spiritual civilization, and persistently fight against various ugly phenomena.

The goals of the people's congress and the administrative, judicial, and procuratorial organs are consistent, and the people's congress supervises them in accordance with the law, which is both support and promotion and necessary restraint. The people's congress must strictly exercise its supervisory power in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and laws. Summarizing the experience of several years of work and starting from the current actual situation, it is necessary to make some regulations on procedures and systems: (1) Examining and approving the reports on the national economic and social development plan and the implementation of the plan, and examining and approving the national budget and the implementation of the budget, are important contents of the people's congress supervising the government's work. These reports were often given to the deputies just before the meeting, but in the future, the draft reports should be sent to the deputies in advance. The plan and budget, once approved by the people's congress, the government must implement them. The implementation of the plan and budget is the power of the government. (2) The Standing Committee meeting held every two months can, according to the needs, listen to and deliberate on the work reports of the State Council and its departments, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, which is the basic form of the Standing Committee to carry out work supervision. The Standing Committee should seriously deliberate on the work reports, and generally does not need to make a decision. The inquiries and questions raised by the deputies should be answered by the relevant departments in a serious and responsible manner. (3) In the third quarter of each year, the State Council should report to the Standing Committee of the people's congress on the implementation of the plan and budget. (4) When the people's congress supervises the work of the courts and procuratorates, it does not directly handle specific cases. If there are opinions on the work of the courts and procuratorates, inquiries and questions can be raised. The correction of wrong cases should be handled by the courts and procuratorates in strict accordance with legal procedures. If the people's congress has opinions on the handling of particularly important cases by the courts and procuratorates, it can listen to the reports of the courts and procuratorates, and can also organize investigations in accordance with the law. If it is confirmed to be a wrong case, it can order the courts and procuratorates to correct or handle it in accordance with the law.

Since the First Session of the Seventh National People's Congress, the Standing Committee has achieved certain results in its work, but there is still a gap between the requirements of the Constitution and the expectations of the people, and there are still many shortcomings and problems in the work. The legislative work is not in line with the requirements of reform and construction, and it is necessary to further speed up the legislative process; how to further make the supervisory work procedural and institutionalized still needs to be summarized and improved in practice; the Standing Committee also needs to strengthen its contact with the National People's Congress deputies and the Standing Committees of local people's congresses.

Comrades and Deputies,

The people's congress system is the fundamental political system of our country and the basic form of the people being masters of the country and exercising the power to manage state affairs. Strengthening and improving the people's congress system is an important part of the political system reform of our country. In the new historical period of reform and opening up and construction, we should, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and under the supervision and support of the National People's Congress deputies and the people of the whole country, strive to do a good job. At present, the work of rectifying the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and comprehensively deepening the reform of our country has entered a critical moment. We believe that at this Congress, through the efforts of all the deputies, by jointly coming up with ideas and solutions, we will surely further promote the implementation of the guiding principles of rectification and rectification and deepening the reform, and will surely make the people of the whole country unite as one, cheer up, strengthen their confidence, and push forward the cause of reform and construction of our country!

The above report is for your consideration.

　　全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告
    ——１９８９年３月２８日在第七届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长兼秘书长  彭冲各位代表：
    我受全国人民代表大会常务委员会的委托，向大会报告七届全国人民代表大会第一次会议以来常委会的工作。
    一年来，全国人大常委会根据宪法赋予的职权，按照七届全国人大一次会议关于常委会工作报告决议的要求，改进和加强各方面的工作，在发展社会主义民主，健全社会主义法制，促进现代化建设和改革开放方面，取得了新的进展。
    一、常委会工作的若干改进
    本届全国人大常委会是在我国社会主义建设和改革开放的重要时期履行职责的。适应这个总形势，常委会工作本着民主、开放、求实的精神，在上届工作的基础上进行了若干改进。主要表现在：
    （１）制定本届常委会工作要点。这个“要点”进一步明确了常委会工作的指导思想，即遵循宪法和中国共产党十三大的精神，以社会主义初级阶段的理论为指导，坚持一个中心、两个基本点，把保证和促进改革开放作为首要职责，把加强社会主义民主和法制建设作为中心任务，把加强自身建设放在重要位置，紧密结合实际，积极开展工作，为社会主义现代化建设和改革开放的顺利进行，创造一个安定团结、民主和谐的良好环境。“要点”对今后五年的立法、监督等方面的工作作了规划，提高了常委会工作的计划性，有利于常委会工作的制度化，也便于全国人大代表和全国人民对常委会工作的了解和监督。
    （２）进一步发挥专门委员会的作用。本届常委会组成人员有７４％是专门委员会的成员，这是加强常委会和专门委员会工作的重要措施。一年来，各专门委员会围绕审议的议案和常委会的立法、监督工作，积极开展调查研究，做了许多工作。七届全国人大一次会议主席团交付各专门委员会审议的９４件议案，经过逐件审议，提出了审议结果的报告，已经常委会批准。专门委员会加强了对法律案的审议、拟订工作，主动与有关部门联系，了解法律的起草情况，做好法律草案审议的准备工作；经常听取有关部门的工作汇报，对一些法律实施情况进行检查。各专门委员会在协助常委会立法和监督方面发挥了重要作用。
    （３）加强同全国人大代表、地方人大和人民群众的联系。为了使常委会制定的法律和作出的决定，更加符合实际，更加符合人民的意愿和要求，也为了使常委会更好地接受代表和人民群众的监督，常委会审议决定重大问题时，注意广泛地征求各方面的意见和建议。一年来，全国人大常委会组成人员分别到各省、自治区、直辖市调查和视察，了解实际情况，倾听人民群众的意见。委员长、副委员长和有关委员会多次召开专题座谈会，听取专家和实际工作者的意见。常委会每次举行会议时，都邀请部分全国人大代表列席会议，参加讨论，对审议和决定问题很有帮助。常委会设立了全国人大代表接待室。对代表通过各种途径提出的建议、批评和意见，常委会办公厅和有关部门及时办理，并作了答复。全国人大常委会把加强同地方人大常委会的联系作为一项重要工作，除继续坚持请各省、自治区、直辖市人大常委会负责人列席常委会会议外，还通过召开各种座谈会等方式同地方人大常委会交流情况和经验，特别是将征求法律草案的意见和联系代表等工作，委托他们协助办理。地方人大常委会在这方面做了大量工作，对我们是很大的支持。做好信访工作，是了解和反映人民意愿和要求的一条重要渠道。去年一年收到人民来信近１２万件；从去年１０月底恢复接待来访到今年２月共接待来访８１００多人次。经过认真办理，解决了一批群众迫切要求解决的问题。
    （４）提高常委会工作的开放程度。常委会不断探索并逐步建立了一些提高开放程度的制度和办法。从常委会第二次会议起，开会前都举行新闻发布会，向中外记者介绍准备提交会议的议程草案以及会议安排的情况，通过新闻媒介向人民公开会议的有关内容。在报道委员审议议案的情况时，注意反映各种意见。常委会会议设置了旁听席，邀请工会、妇联和共青团等群众组织的人员旁听。有些重要法律草案，如行政诉讼法草案、香港特别行政区基本法草案，还在报纸上全文公布，在全国广泛征求意见。这样做，有利于发扬社会主义民主，集中群众的智慧，使法律制订得更加周到。
    （５）改进外事工作。全国人大及其常委会的外事工作是我国整个外交工作的一个重要组成部分。常委会加强了对外事工作的统一规划，有计划地开展议会外交，并本着节约从简、不失礼貌的原则，对礼宾工作作了一些改革。１９８８年，全国人大常委会、各专门委员会和常委会办事机构共派出１１个代表团，访问了１８个国家和欧洲议会，参加了４次国际会议，接待了３０个国家的代表团和欧洲议会代表团。通过交往，增进了相互之间的友谊和了解，加强了同这些国家议会的友好关系，促进了国家关系的发展。针对美国国会参议院和欧洲议会干涉我国内政的举动，我人大外事委员会发表声明予以谴责，表明我们的严正立场，得到了全国人民的支持和拥护。
    （６）建立和健全工作制度。为了使常委会工作走向程序化、制度化，常委会把工作制度建设放在重要位置上。委员长会议根据宪法和全国人民代表大会组织法的有关规定，制定了议事规则，对委员长会议讨论决定问题和文件处理等程序，作出了明确规定。各专门委员会制定的工作规则，对本委员会的职责、组织机构、会议制度、工作方法等作了具体规定。常委会办事机构也进一步建立健全了工作制度，提高了工作效率。
    二、加强立法工作和对法律实施的监督
    为了逐步建立社会主义商品经济新秩序，用法律手段保障现代化建设和改革开放的顺利进行，常委会抓紧了法律的制定和现行法律的修改工作。一年来，常委会通过了１３个法律和有关法律的决定。这是我国立法工作取得的又一批成果。关于修改土地管理法的决定，根据七届全国人大一次会议通过的宪法修正案中关于土地的规定，对土地管理法中土地使用制度的条款作了修改和补充。这对于完善国家土地管理制度，充分合理地利用土地，具有重要意义。标准化法和进出口商品检验法，对于促进技术进步，提高产品质量，发展对外贸易和经济技术合作，将起到有力的推动作用。根据国家建设需要，还制定了保守国家秘密法、传染病防治法和野生动物保护法。军官军衔条例和现役军官服役条例的制定和实施，有利于加强军队的指挥、管理和现代化、正规化建设。
    提请这次大会审议的行政诉讼法草案和全国人民代表大会议事规则草案，是常委会抓紧拟订并经反复审议的两个重要法律草案。行政诉讼法是同刑事诉讼法、民事诉讼法同等重要的基本法律。它的制定和实施，将进一步保障公民、组织的合法权益，维护和监督依法行使行政权，促进廉政建设，提高工作效能。全国人民代表大会议事规则，是最高国家权力机关行使职权的程序法。它的制定和实施，有利于进一步发扬民主和提高议事效率，标志着全国人大工作向制度化、法律化迈进了一步。
    经过三年多的努力，香港特别行政区基本法的起草工作已经完成，经常委会初步审议，决定予以公布，经再次征询意见并修改后，将于明年提请七届全国人大三次会议通过。
    根据本届常委会工作要点，对立法工作作了具体安排。今明两年要重点制定与治理整顿和深化改革有关的法律，如物价管理法、预算法、银行法、公司法、私营企业法、制止不正当竞争法等。还要制定保障公民权利和维护社会公共秩序方面的法律，如新闻法、出版法、社团法、集会游行示威法等。教育法、教师法等教育科技方面的法律，也要抓紧制定。上述安排，有些是今明两年可以完成的，有些要花较长时间，需提早动手，抓紧调查研究和起草工作。大部分法律案由国务院提出，为了加快立法步伐，国务院已作了部署，各专门委员会正在加强同有关部门的联系。还将组织科研、教学单位的专家参加法律草拟工作。制定有关调节商品经济关系的法律，可以结合我国实际借鉴国外的某些法律，有的可以先制定行政法规或地方性法规。立法程序也要总结经验，进一步完善。
    当前法制建设的一个突出问题是，有些已经制定的法律没有得到很好的实施。造成这种状况的原因是多方面的，需要采取有力措施综合治理，切实加以解决。各级人大、政府、法院、检察院都负有保证宪法和法律实施的重要职责。全国人大常委会的一项重要职权是监督宪法的实施。一年来，常委会在支持和督促有关地方和部门纠正违反宪法和法律的行为方面，做了一些工作，但还需要进一步改进和加强。各专门委员会除了审查向常委会备案的地方性法规外，还对民族区域自治法、工业企业法、义务教育法、文物保护法、草原法、专利法、药品管理法、食品卫生法（试行）等法律的实施情况，进行调查研究，听取有关部门的汇报，提出了执法中需要解决的问题和意见。必须指出，在治理整顿中，如何充分运用有关打击严重经济犯罪的法律，如何全面贯彻工业企业法的问题，还没有解决好。全国人大及其常委会通过的刑法和关于严惩严重破坏经济的罪犯的决定，关于惩治走私罪和惩治贪污罪、贿赂罪的两个补充规定等法律，为治理整顿、保障为政清廉，提供了有力的法律武器。但是，这些法律在有的部门和地方并没有得到认真的执行，有法不依、执法不严、查处不力、以罚代刑、以言代法的问题相当严重，人民群众对此意见很大。对经济犯罪活动，必须依法严惩，坚决纠正打击不力的状况。七届全国人大一次会议通过的企业法，是关于我国全民所有制工业企业的基本法律，但目前实施的难度较大，主要是企业作为独立法人的权利得不到应有的保障；对企业行为的约束机制也很不完善。深化企业改革，必须狠抓企业法的贯彻落实，抓紧制定同企业法配套的法律、法规，这是推动我国整个经济体制改革所不容忽视的重要环节。民族区域自治法是实施宪法规定的民族区域自治制度的基本法律，各自治地方要抓紧制定自治条例。今后常委会要进一步加强对宪法和法律实施的监督：审查行政法规、地方性法规；听取国务院及其有关部门、最高人民法院和最高人民检察院关于法律实施情况的报告；有选择地对一些重要法律的实施情况进行检查；对于违宪违法问题，要督促有关部门认真纠正。
    为了改变有法不依、执法不严、违法不究的状况，还必须增强干部和群众的法制观念，学会运用法律武器同一切违反宪法和法律的行为做斗争。为此，需要继续做好普及法律常识的工作。常委会再次听取了司法部关于普法工作的情况汇报，肯定了普法工作的成绩，指出这是一项长期的艰巨的任务，要扎扎实实地抓下去。
    三、加强工作监督支持治理整顿
    七届全国人大一次会议上，代表们反映了人民群众普遍关心的物价、工资、农业、教育、社会治安等方面的问题。中共中央十分重视，国务院为此成立了专题小组进行调查研究，酝酿解决的方案。常委会第三次会议听取了姚依林副总理关于物价、工资改革初步方案的汇报。党的十三届三中全会分析了全国形势，及时确定了治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革的指导方针。为了支持和促进这一方针的贯彻执行，常委会第四次会议作出了《关于加强民主法制维护安定团结保障改革和建设顺利进行的决定》，指出要进一步发展社会主义民主，加强社会主义法制，巩固和发展安定团结的政治局面，动员全国人民紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，同心同德，艰苦奋斗，积极投身到治理整顿的工作中去。常委会第五次会议听取了姚依林副总理关于当前经济形势和１９８９年计划安排的汇报。委员们认为，国务院为治理整顿做了很多工作，已初见成效，还必须继续采取有力措施，坚决抑制需求过旺、经济过热、物价上涨过猛的现象，争取在两年或更长一些时间基本实现治理整顿的目标。
    常委会还听取了国务院有关部委关于农业、教育、社会治安、文物保护和对台工作的汇报。这些汇报既谈了成绩，也报告了工作中的缺点和存在的主要问题，提出了今后改进的措施，委员们表示基本满意。同时，大家本着对人民负责的精神，该肯定的肯定，该批评的批评，有针对性地提出一些意见和建议。如许多委员提出，我国农业特别是粮食生产，虽然１９８４年登上一个新台阶，但以后连续４年徘徊，必须引起严重注意。要深刻认识我国农业的战略地位，努力解决农业投资不足、农用生产资料价格过高和农产品价格不合理等问题，切实改善农业生产条件，提高农业的科学技术水平，促进农业生产的发展。不少委员强调，要切实把振兴教育、发展科技放在现代化建设突出重要的地位，从认识上、体制上、资金上认真解决存在的问题和困难。委员们还提出，对当前社会治安和社会风气方面出现的严重问题，必须予以高度重视，要采取坚决措施进行综合治理，进一步加强社会主义精神文明建设，坚持不懈地同各种丑恶现象作斗争。
    人大和行政、审判、检察机关的总目标是一致的，人大依法进行监督，对它们的工作既是支持和促进，也是必要的制约。人大必须严格按照宪法和法律的规定行使监督权。总结几年来工作的经验，从目前实际情况出发，需要从程序上、制度上作出若干规定：（１）审查和批准国民经济和社会发展计划和计划执行情况的报告，审查和批准国家的预算和预算执行情况的报告，是人民代表大会对政府工作监督的重要内容。这些报告过去往往是临会发给代表，今后应提前把报告草案送交代表。计划和预算一经人民代表大会批准，政府必须遵照执行。执行计划和预算是政府的职权。（２）每两个月一次的常委会会议，可以根据需要听取和审议国务院及其部委、最高人民法院、最高人民检察院的工作汇报，这是常委会进行工作监督的基本形式。常委会对工作汇报要认真审议，一般不需要作出决议。委员提出的质询和询问，有关部门应认真负责地作出答复。（３）每年第三季度，由国务院向人大常委会分别作关于计划、预算执行情况的报告。（４）人大在监督法院和检察院的工作时，不直接处理具体案件。如对法院、检察院的工作有意见，可以提出质询和询问。纠正错案应由法院、检察院严格按照法律程序去办。人大如果对法院、检察院处理的特别重大案件有意见，可以听取法院、检察院的汇报，也可以依法组织调查，如确属错案，可以责成法院、检察院依法纠正或处理。
    七届全国人大一次会议以来，常委会的工作取得了一定的成绩，但是，离宪法的要求和人民的期望还有差距，工作中还存在不少缺点和问题。立法工作还不适应改革和建设的要求，需要进一步加快立法步伐；监督工作如何进一步做到程序化、制度化，还需要在实践中继续总结经验，加以改进；常委会在同全国人大代表和地方人大常委会联系方面，也还做得不够，需要进一步加强。
    各位代表：
    人民代表大会制度是我国的根本政治制度，是人民当家作主，行使管理国家事务权力的基本形式。加强和完善人民代表大会制度，是我国政治体制改革的重要内容。在改革开放和建设的新的历史时期，我们要在中国共产党的领导下，在全国人大代表和全国人民的监督和支持下，努力做好工作。当前，我国治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序和全面深化改革的工作，已进入一个关键时刻。我们相信，在这次大会上，经过全体代表的努力，共同出主意、想办法，一定会进一步推动治理整顿、深化改革方针的贯彻落实，一定会使全国人民同心同德，振奋精神，增强信心，把我国的改革和建设事业推向前进！
    以上报告，请予审议。
