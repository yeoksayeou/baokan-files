From space, Earth appears as a blue sphere because it is enveloped by a thick layer of water. The total global water resources amount to approximately 13.8 to 14 billion cubic kilometers. However, 96.5% of this is seawater, which is not directly usable. The remaining 3.5% of freshwater on land is mostly locked up in glaciers, snow-capped mountains, rocks, groundwater, and soil. Only 0.35% of the total freshwater reserves are available for human use, consisting of river and lake runoff and shallow groundwater. Water circulates in a closed system within the global water cycle, where ocean water and land water exchange through evaporation, precipitation, and runoff, maintaining a balance. The freshwater that humans can directly use comes from the stable runoff portion of this cyclical precipitation, amounting to approximately 9,000 cubic kilometers per year. Numerically, humans possess 9,000 cubic kilometers of freshwater resources, which should be sufficient to prevent water shortages. However, the water resource crisis is a global issue.

The distribution of global precipitation is uneven in both time and space, commonly referred to as "droughts and floods." According to statistics from 98 countries, more than half have an average annual per capita water resource of less than 5,000 cubic meters, classifying them as water-poor or semi-water-poor countries. Only about one-third have more than 10,000 cubic meters per capita, classifying them as water-rich countries. Among these, Canada, the richest in water resources, has an average annual per capita water resource of 122,000 cubic meters, and Panama has 66,000 cubic meters. The poorest countries, such as Oman, have only 540 cubic meters per capita per year, and Kenya has 720 cubic meters. Even in water-rich countries like the United States, Australia, and the Soviet Union, uneven temporal and spatial distribution often leads to water shortages in certain regions. If a country's annual water usage reaches or exceeds one-third of its available water supply, it is considered to have reached a critical stage of development and utilization. Currently, 19 countries are in this situation, particularly those around the Sahara and in the Middle East, which have been near their water resource development limits for over a decade.

Population growth and urban development have also contributed to water shortages in certain regions. At the beginning of the 20th century, the global population was approximately 1.6 billion. By the mid-20th century, it had grown to 2.5 billion, and by 1987, it had doubled to 5 billion. It is projected that by the year 2000, the global population will reach 6.35 billion, reducing the per capita water resource from 11,800 cubic meters in 1975 to 7,400 cubic meters. Currently, a city with a population of 1 million requires at least 500,000 cubic meters of water per day, which may increase to 1 million cubic meters in the future. The annual growth rate of urban living water usage has already far exceeded the growth rate of industrial and agricultural water usage.

The third factor contributing to water shortages is the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production and the economy. It is estimated that in the first 75 years of this century, the global industrial and agricultural water usage increased by an average of 2.7% per year. By the year 2000, it is projected to reach 600 million cubic meters, with an annual growth rate of 2.8%.

On one hand, freshwater consumption is rapidly increasing, while on the other hand, industrial wastewater is being discharged into rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, leading to severe pollution of surface and groundwater. The world's industrial and urban areas alone discharge 500 cubic kilometers of wastewater annually, which is expected to increase to 3,000 cubic kilometers by the year 2000. Wastewater not only poses a significant threat to the ecological environment but also severely damages usable water resources. If using the method of diluting one part of wastewater with ten parts of freshwater for purification, it would almost exhaust all the river runoff resources in the world.

To address the water shortage problem, various countries have their own approaches:

- Establishing water-saving cities and agriculture, reforming irrigation methods, adopting water-saving measures, and implementing automated water management.

- Increasing the recycling rate of industrial water and the utilization rate of treated wastewater, and artificially replenishing groundwater.

- Implementing economic policies, such as progressive pricing, charging water fees and water resource fees; in regions or cities with severe water resource crises, implementing high water fee policies to curb urban development and water-intensive industries.

- Establishing national water quality monitoring agencies, protecting water resources, and implementing water pollution control laws.

- Developing new water sources, including the construction of reservoirs to intercept runoff. In the past 30-50 years, over 10,000 large reservoirs have been built worldwide, with a total capacity exceeding 5,000 cubic kilometers. Many countries are also exploring the production of various seawater desalination and anti-evaporation measures in arid regions.

- Cross-basin water transfer to balance the geographical distribution of water resources. Countries like the United States, the Soviet Union, Japan, India, Peru, Pakistan, and China have built large-scale cross-basin water transfer projects.

- Legal water management. Currently, at least one-third of the countries in the world have enacted and issued water laws or water resource laws. Some international water resource organizations study and provide international guidelines for the allocation and utilization of water resources in river basins that cross multiple countries.

### 水、水、水，水的危机

　　水、水、水，水的危机
　　王衍
    从宇宙空间看，地球是个蓝色的球体。这是因为地球外层有一个厚厚的水圈环绕。全球的水资源总量约为１３．８—１４亿立方公里。但其中不能直接利用的海洋咸水约占９６．５％，剩下的３．５％陆地水，绝大部分又被冰川、雪山、岩石、地下水和土壤水所占去。可供人类采用的河湖径流水和浅层地下水，仅占淡水总储量的０．３５％。水在环球水圈中自成一个封闭的循环体系，海洋水与陆地水之间，通过蒸发、降水、水流等，形成循环平衡。人类真正能够直接采用的淡水，是来自这种循环平衡降水中那部分稳定径流，其总量约为每年９０００立方公里。仅从数字推算，人类拥有９０００立方公里的淡水资源量，应不致于缺水，但水资源的危机却是全球性的问题。
    全世界降水的时间和空间分布不均，俗称旱涝不均。据对９８个国家所作的统计分析，每人每年平均拥有水资源量在５０００立方米以下的贫水半贫水国家占一半以上，拥有１００００立方米以上的富水国家不足１／３。其中富水“首户”加拿大每人每年平均拥有水资源量高达１２．２万立方米，巴拿马为６．６万立方米；而最为贫水的国家，如阿曼每人每年仅有５４０立方米，肯尼亚７２０立方米。同时，即使在富水的大国，如美国、澳大利亚和苏联，也因时空分布不均往往造成一部分地区缺水。一个国家如果一年中的用水量达到或超过其可供水量的１／３，其开发利用程度便已达到临界状态。而现在世界已有１９个国家处于这种状况，特别是撒哈拉周围及中东地区的国家，早在十几年前已接近其水资源的可开发极限。
    人口膨胀和城市集中发展，在一定程度上也导致了局部地区严重缺水。本世纪初世界人口约１６亿，本世纪中叶已达２５亿，１９８７年又翻了一番达５０亿。预测到２０００年世界人口将增至６３．５亿，人均水资源的拥有量将从１９７５年的１１８００立方米跌减到７４００立方米。目前一个１００万人口的城市，每天至少需水５０万立方米，将来可能增至１００万立方米。目前世界城市里的生活用水年平均增长率已远远高于工农业用水增长速度。
    造成缺水的第三个因素，是工农业生产和社会经济的迅速发展。据推算，本世纪前７５年，世界工农业用水量年平均增长２．７％。预测到２０００年将达６亿立方米，年平均增长率２．８％。
    一方面是淡水消耗骤增，另一方面则是工业废水排入河流、湖泊和水库，导致地表水和地下水的严重污染。仅世界工业和城市每年排放的废水即达５００立方公里，到２０００年将增加到每年３０００立方公里。污水不仅对生态环境构成极大的威胁，并且严重破坏了可用水，如果按平均１０份淡水可以稀释１份污水的净化方法进行处理，几乎要耗尽世界全部河流的径流资源。
    如何解决缺水问题，世界各国各有尝试。
    ——建立节水型城市、节水型农业、改革灌溉方式，采取节水措施，实行自动化管水等。
    ——提高工业用水循环利用率和废水净化利用率，人工回灌地下水等。
    ——运用经济政策，实行累进收费制度，征收水费和水资源费；在水资源危机严重的地区或城市，实行高价水费政策，抑制城市和耗水量大的工业发展。
    ——成立国家的水质监测机构，保护水资源，颁布实施水质污染控制法等。
    ——增辟新的水源，包括先期实行的修建水库拦蓄径流。近３０—５０年来全世界共修建大型水库１万多座，总库容超过５０００立方公里。不少国家近期又在探索试制各种海水淡化和干旱地区防止水面蒸发措施。
    ——跨流域调水，调节水资源地理分布的不均衡。美国、苏联、日本、印度、秘鲁、巴基斯坦和我国都建有大规模的跨流域调水工程。
    ——依法管水。目前世界上至少有１／３的国家已制定颁发了水法或水资源法。一些国际水资源组织针对有国际争端的用水问题，对于跨几个国家领土的流域，在上下游之间水资源的分配利用问题上，进行国际指导规范的研究。
