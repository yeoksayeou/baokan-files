People's Daily, London, April 16th - Reporter Chen Te'an: Yesterday afternoon, the city of Sheffield in the UK saw a tragic event at Hillsborough Football Stadium. In what is considered one of the worst disasters in British football history, 93 people lost their lives and 170 were injured.

At 3 PM, the FA Cup semi-final match between two top British teams, Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, was underway. Just six minutes into the game, over 3,000 Liverpool fans, who did not have tickets, rushed towards the stands behind the Liverpool goal. The crowd surged forward, and the space was insufficient. Many people began climbing over an 8-foot-high metal fence to escape the extreme crowding. Some were pushed down the stands, others were trampled, and many were crushed to death.

Following the incident, both Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher expressed shock and offered condolences to the families of the victims. Thatcher visited the site today, and relevant authorities have begun investigating the accident. It is reported that the Home Secretary is expected to present a report to Parliament tomorrow. The Liverpool Football Club has announced a fund of £100,000 for the victims.

Regarding the causes of this disaster, various opinions have emerged in the media: some criticize the police for allowing ticketless Liverpool fans to enter, but the police argue that this was done to relieve congestion at the entrance; others point to design flaws in the stadium; and some blame the organizers for poor planning and execution of the event.

　　英足球场发生特大惨案
　　近百人死亡　百余人受伤
    本报伦敦４月１６日电　记者陈特安报道：昨天下午，英国设菲尔德市希尔斯堡足球场内人山人海，英国足球运动史上一场有９３人丧生、１７０人受伤的空前悲剧不幸发生了。
    下午３点，英国足协杯赛半决赛在英国的两支劲旅——利物浦队与诺丁汉森队之间开赛。开球之后６分钟，支持利物浦队的３０００多球迷们无票入场，拥向利物浦队球门后面的看台。人流如潮而空间过小，许多人开始翻越一堵８英尺高的金属栅栏以避开极度拥挤，许多人被挤下了看台台阶，有的人被挤倒，许多人被踩死或挤死。
    事故发生后，英国女王和玛·撒切尔首相均表示震惊，并对受难者亲属表示慰问。撒切尔夫人还于今天赶赴现场，有关部门已着手对事故进行调查。据报道，内政大臣预计明天将向议会提出有关报告。利物浦足球俱乐部已宣布为受难者们献出１０万英镑的基金。
    关于引起这场灾难的原因，此间舆论已有种种说法：有的抱怨警察不应放无票的利物浦队球迷们入场，但警察争辩说，此举正是为了缓解入口处的拥挤；有的埋怨体育场设计上有不妥之处；有的也抱怨这次比赛的组织工作考虑欠周。
