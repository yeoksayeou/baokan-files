Title: Has the U.S.-Israel Relationship Soured?

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, April 7th.

Egyptian President Mubarak had just left the White House when Israeli Prime Minister Shamir arrived in Washington. This time, it will be interesting to see what Shamir has to say to the U.S. President.

Israel has always been touted as an "extension of American civilization." However, in Western television news, Israel is now portrayed as soldiers aiming their guns at Palestinian children as young as four or five. To avoid suspicion, American officials have distanced themselves from Tel Aviv. Western public opinion has shifted. During this visit to the United States, Shamir will surely feel that the U.S.-Israel relationship has become a bit sour.

Mubarak and Bush held talks on April 3, creating a significant ripple effect that hit Shamir head-on. "At the appropriate time, a properly structured international conference can be effective," and "Israel should stop occupying the West Bank and Gaza," Bush's remarks carried weight. The PLO immediately gave a positive evaluation. It is said that the Israeli Foreign Ministry ordered no public comments on Bush's remarks, waiting for Shamir to personally go to Washington to get a clear answer.

In fact, it is not just Shamir who needs clarification. Before Shamir's trip to the U.S., Bush and Secretary of State Baker had already informed Israel to bring the "new Middle East plan" to Washington. According to current media reports, the plan Shamir brought includes approximately five points: 1) Conduct civic elections in the West Bank and Gaza, with the Israeli authorities negotiating with the elected representatives, and Israeli troops "can" withdraw from some occupied cities; 2) "It is possible" for Egypt and Jordan to "assist" in holding the elections; 3) Reopen schools, release detained Palestinians, and "create an atmosphere for negotiations"; 4) Implement the transitional period of Palestinian "autonomy"; 5) "Any issue can be negotiated," except for the principle of "land for peace" and direct negotiations with the PLO.

This will be interesting to watch. Regardless of whether Shamir's plan has any new content, the core remains the old prescription of "autonomy," and just from the surface, it is at odds with President Bush's views. The U.S. advocates for "land for peace," but Shamir firmly opposes it; the U.S. advocates for ending the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, but Shamir also opposes it; the U.S. agrees to convene an "appropriately structured" international conference, but Israel still disagrees. The Bush administration's basic idea for politically resolving the Middle East issue differs from Shamir's stance. Western news agencies have predicted that "sharp confrontation" between the U.S. and Israel in this round of talks is inevitable.

Of course, the strategic alliance between Israel and the U.S. has not changed, and "ensuring Israel's security" remains one of the three pillars of U.S. Middle East policy. In the short term, both the U.S. and Israel are trying, in different forms, to weaken or stop the uprising of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories, seeking a breathing space. Israel "will not allow a Palestinian state to emerge in the Middle East," and although the U.S. considers the issue from a different angle, it at least, so far, opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state. Therefore, the talks between Shamir and Bush will have both "sharp confrontation" and common ground.

Now, the U.S.-Israel relationship is at a sensitive and delicate moment: one side is stubbornly pursuing an unrealistic goal; the other side, aware of the changing situation, is wisely preparing to explore new paths. The Bush administration has learned from past failures and is cautiously taking small steps in the Middle East, trying to open a gap for direct dialogue between Israel and the PLO. Israel, however, firmly refuses to negotiate with the PLO. According to analysis, the "appropriate structure" of the international conference and who will represent the "Palestinians" in direct talks between Israel and the PLO will be the key issues in the talks between Bush and Shamir.

The leaders of Egypt, Israel, and Jordan will visit Washington to meet with President Bush in the near future, which is an important move in U.S. Middle East diplomacy. The 40-year history of turmoil in the Middle East has repeatedly proven that "peace opportunities are fleeting." At this critical moment, if the U.S. does not make a firm decision to force Israel to accept reality, causing the hope for peace on the Arab side to be dashed once again, in the end, it may be the U.S. that pays a greater price.

During the U.S.-Israel talks, a famous saying in Israeli newspapers is worth Bush's consideration: "Not all Israelis are Shamir."

　　美以关系变味了？
    本报记者  林皎明
    埃及总统穆巴拉克前脚走出白宫，以色列总理沙米尔后脚跟进华盛顿。这回，要看沙米尔对美国总统说些什么。
    以色列历来被标榜为“美国文明的延伸”。可现在，西方电视新闻中的以色列，却是这么个形象：手扣扳机的大兵朝仅有４、５岁的巴勒斯坦幼童射击。美国官员为避嫌，拉开了与特拉维夫的距离。西方公众的舆论倾向产生倒戈。沙米尔总理这次访问美国，不会没有感觉到美以关系有点变味了。
    穆巴拉克与布什４月３日会谈，造成一股不小的冲击波，朝沙米尔迎面击来。“在合适时机，召开适当结构的国际会议，能起有效作用”，“以色列应该停止对约旦河西岸和加沙地带的占领”，布什总统的这番讲话分量不轻。巴解组织立即予以积极评价。据说以色列外交部下令不许对布什讲话公开评论，待沙米尔亲自到华盛顿问个明白。
    实际上，要问个明白的不止沙米尔，布什总统和贝克国务卿在沙米尔启程访美前，早就通知以色列把“中东新方案”带到华盛顿来。据目前新闻界披露，沙米尔总理带去的方案大致包括５点内容：１、在西岸和加沙地带进行公民选举，以色列当局与选出代表举行谈判，以色列军队“可以”从被占领土部分城市撤出；２、“可以”由埃及、约旦出面“帮助”举行选举；３、学校复课、释放被拘禁的巴勒斯坦人，“创造和谈气氛”；４、实施巴勒斯坦“自治”过渡期；５、“什么问题都可以谈判”，唯独不能谈“以土地换取和平”的原则，不能与巴解组织面对面谈判。
    这就有戏看了。且不说沙米尔总理的方案有没有什么新内容，核心仍旧是“自治”的老药方，仅从字面上看，就与美国总统布什的意见对立。美国主张“以土地换取和平”，沙米尔坚决反对；美国主张结束对西岸和加沙地带的占领，沙米尔也反对；美国同意召开“结构适当”的国际会议，以色列还是不同意。布什政府对政治解决中东问题的基本设想与沙米尔坚持的立场产生分歧。西方通讯社纷纷预测，美以在这次会谈中“尖锐对立”已在所难免。
    当然，以色列与美国的战略结盟关系没有变，“确保以色列的安全”仍是美国中东政策的３大支柱之一。就近期目标来说，美国和以色列都在以不同形式力图减弱或制止被占领土巴勒斯坦人民起义，求得喘息之机。以色列“绝不容许在中东出现一个巴勒斯坦国”，美国虽然与以色列考虑角度不同，但至少到目前为止也反对成立巴勒斯坦国。因此，沙米尔与布什会谈既有“尖锐对立”，也还有共同语言。
    现在，美以两国关系处在敏感的微妙时刻：一方，缘木求鱼，一条路上走到黑；另一方，觉察大势在变，明智地与巴解组织对话，准备另辟蹊径。布什政府从过去多次碰壁中引出教训，在中东谨慎地迈小步，竭力打开以色列同巴勒斯坦直接对话的缺口。以色列却坚决不同巴解组织会谈。据分析，国际会议的“适当结构”究竟是个什么框架，巴以直接谈判中的“巴勒斯坦”究竟由谁来代表，将是布什与沙米尔会谈的要害。
    埃及、以色列、约旦３国领导人短期内分别到华盛顿与布什总统会谈，是美国中东外交的重要举动。中东４０年动乱历史多次证明“和平时机稍纵即失”。在关键时刻，美国如不痛下决心迫使以色列接受现实，而使阿拉伯一方的和平希望再次破灭，到头来恐怕要由美国付出更大的代价。
    美以会谈之际，以色列报刊的一句名言很值得布什总统思索：“以色列人并不都是沙米尔”。
