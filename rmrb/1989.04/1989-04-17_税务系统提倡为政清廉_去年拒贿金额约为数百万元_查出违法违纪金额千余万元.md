In the past year, the national taxation system has seen the emergence of a large number of advanced collectives and individuals. According to incomplete statistics from 24 provinces and municipalities including Beijing, Hebei, Shanxi, and Liaoning, the amount of bribes refused by tax officials last year reached 4.37 million yuan. Various local tax authorities have fully played their supervisory roles, seriously investigating and punishing a number of law-breaking and disciplinary-offending individuals, uncovering illegal and disciplinary offenses amounting to more than 100 million yuan. This was mentioned by Vice Minister of the State Taxation Administration, Niú Lìchéng, at the national tax system political work conference held in Wuhan on April 17th.

He said that in the face of the severe situation last year, where monetary policy was tightened, enterprises owed taxes, banks withheld tax revenues, and export tax refunds increased significantly, the broad masses of tax officials overcame numerous difficulties and achieved the remarkable feat of exceeding the tax collection target by 4.2 billion yuan. This achievement is closely linked to the taxation system's efforts in strengthening clean governance and ensuring the smooth implementation of tax policies.

In 1988, the taxation system explored a feasible path for clean governance: "First, rely on education; second, rely on systems; third, rely on discipline."

It is understood that currently, there are 500,000 tax officials nationwide.

　　税务系统提倡为政清廉
　　去年拒贿金额约为数百万元
　　查出违法违纪金额千余万元
    本报讯　记者刘霄报道：在过去的一年里，全国税务系统涌现出了一大批先进集体和个人。据对北京、河北、山西、辽宁等２４个省市的不完全统计，去年税务干部拒贿金额达４３７万余元。各地税务机关充分发挥监察作用，严肃查处了一批违法违纪人员，查出违法违纪金额１０００多万元。这是国家税务局副局长牛立成在４月１７日武汉召开的全国税务系统政治工作会议上提到的。
    他说，去年在抽紧银根、企业欠税、银行占压税款、出口退税大量增加的严峻形势下，广大税务干部克服重重困难，取得了超收４２亿元的可喜成绩，这和税务系统加强廉政建设，保持税令畅通是分不开的。
    １９８８年，税务系统摸索出了廉政建设“一靠教育，二靠制度，三靠纪律”的可行之路。
    据悉，目前全国税务干部已有５０万人。
