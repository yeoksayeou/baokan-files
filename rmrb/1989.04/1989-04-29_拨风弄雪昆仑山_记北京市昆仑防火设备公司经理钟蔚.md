It is not the towering Kunlun Mountains, nor is it windy and snowy, but the workers say this place is the "snowy Kunlun Mountains."

Indeed, once ordinary state-owned workers come to Beijing Kunlun Fire Protection Equipment Company, their "state-owned" status no longer counts. Everyone is on a contract system: contracts are signed annually, good performers stay, poor performers leave; monthly wages are changed to daily wages, paid by the day... For those accustomed to the "iron rice bowl," this does feel a bit like severe wind and snow.

Company manager Zhong Wei is the one who "parts the wind and snow" on this "Kunlun Mountain." He has a famous saying: "People have not yet reached communism, but food cannot be eaten communally." After all, labor is still a means of livelihood. Yet, people insist on giving out "iron rice bowls" and eating from the "big pot." How can people be diligent? Not to mention others, just look at Zhong Wei himself. A few years ago, he was a deputy director in a factory. This factory was far out in the suburbs, while Zhong Wei lived in the city. At that time, Zhong Wei preferred to attend meetings in the city, as it saved him the trouble of going to the suburbs.

However, Zhong Wei is not just an ordinary person. In 1984, at the age of 40, Zhong Wei was serving as the deputy manager of Beijing Construction Hardware and Sanitary Ware Industry Company. Although his position was not high, he had a secure job. Zhong Wei, however, found it boring and wanted to do something, to take some risks. He saw the potential in the fire protection equipment industry. In recent years, high-rise buildings have been springing up rapidly. Without fire protection equipment, a fire would be disastrous! Zhong Wei borrowed 500,000 yuan from the company and, with two retired workers, developed seven new types of fire protection equipment in a basement. In March 1985, he established Kunlun Company. Although it was called a company, it had no production plant and no market. Zhong Wei came up with a strategy: horizontal cooperation. The products were spread to a batch of enterprises, and Kunlun-brand steel fire doors, fireproof soundproof doors, and other products entered one high-rise building after another.

"Kunlun" hangs the sign of a collective enterprise, but the workers from all directions all have a "state-owned" identity, holding "iron rice bowls." Zhong Wei wanted to make "Kunlun" a highly efficient enterprise, but he always felt uncomfortable with these "iron rice bowls." In August 1987, Zhong Wei took a bold step: implementing a contract employment system. Two registration forms were distributed to the workers: one for leaving and finding another job, the other for staying and not holding an "iron rice bowl."

Where should one sign their name? The workers thought it over. Thinking about the company's history, "Kunlun" had risen from taking risks; looking at the prospects of reform, the "iron rice bowl" could not be held forever. Zhong Wei explained to everyone: Even the heavens will have wind and snow, and a commodity economy will have risks. It's better to bravely face risks than to fear them. Let's Kunlun people take the lead, not hold "iron rice bowls," and create our own destiny. Of the more than 60 workers, only 3 left, and later, more than 30 people joined. By the end of last year, "Kunlun" was recruiting new workers, and a large group of applicants came, all with bachelor's degrees.

Efficiency and risk go hand in hand, income and efficiency are linked. Kunlun workers created high efficiency: production value increased from 453,000 yuan in 1985 to more than 20 million yuan in 1988; "Kunlun" now has 28 branches nationwide. Workers' income also increased significantly, with an average income of more than 3,000 yuan in 1988.

Creating one's own destiny in the face of risk, realizing one's value in the face of risk. This is the attraction of the "snowy Kunlun Mountains."

Zhong Wei is tall and has fair skin, with a head of black hair, though that black hair is dyed. He has devoted his heart and soul to the development of "Kunlun"! Implementing the contract employment system, he has dismissed some workers, inevitably offending people. Someone called Zhong Wei, threatening to come in with a white knife and leave with a red one. Zhong Wei replied bluntly: If you are a man, come on! If you are afraid of this, then don't carry out reforms.

　　“拨风弄雪昆仑山”    
    ——记北京市昆仑防火设备公司经理钟蔚
    本报记者  皮树义
    不是那高大的昆仑山，也不刮风下雪，可职工却说这里是“风雪昆仑山”。
    也是的，好好的全民职工，来到北京市昆仑防火设备公司，那“全民”就不算数了，一律是聘用合同制：一年签一次合同，干好者留，干坏者走；月工资改日工资，来一天算一天……这对端惯了“铁饭碗”的人们来说，也真有点风雪严寒的味道。
    公司经理钟蔚就是这“昆仑山”上的“拨风弄雪”人。他有句名言：人没到共产主义，饭不能按共产主义吃。本来嘛，现在劳动还是谋生的手段，可偏要发个“铁饭碗”、吃“大锅饭”，人怎么能勤快？不说别人，就说钟蔚自己吧。前些年，他在一家工厂当副厂长，这工厂远在郊外，钟蔚家住城里，那时，钟蔚就愿意在市里开会，一开会，就省得往城外跑了。
    不过，钟蔚毕竟不是一条虫。１９８４年，４０岁的钟蔚正当着北京市建筑五金水暖器材工业公司经理助理。官虽不大，可是把“铁交椅”，钟蔚却觉着没劲，非要折腾点事，冒冒风险。他看准了防火设备这个行当。这些年，高楼大厦呼呼地起，高楼大厦没有防火设备，着了火就惨了！钟蔚从公司借来５万元钱，领着２名退休工人，在一间地下室里，鼓捣出７种新型防火设备。１９８５年３月，办起了昆仑公司。说是公司，没有生产厂，也没有市场。钟蔚想出一个招：横向联合。产品扩散到了一批企业，昆仑牌钢制防火门、防火隔音门……也走进了一座座高楼大厦。
    “昆仑”挂得是集体企业的牌子，来自四面八方的职工却都有个“全民”身份，端的是“铁饭碗”。钟蔚要把“昆仑”办成一家高效率的企业，总瞧着这“铁饭碗”别扭。１９８７年８月，钟蔚来了狠的：实行聘用合同制。两张登记表发到了职工手里：一张是走，另寻高枝；一张是留，不端“铁饭碗”。
    到底在哪一张留下自己的大名？职工们思来想去。想想公司的发家史，“昆仑”就是从风险中起来的；看看改革的前景，“铁饭碗”也不能永远捧下去。钟蔚向大家讲一个理：老天爷还要刮风下雪，搞商品经济还能没有风险。怕风险不如勇敢地迎接风险。咱昆仑人先走一步，不端“铁饭碗”，命运自己创。６０多位职工只有３人走了，以后又有３０多人上了“山”。去年底，“昆仑”招聘新职工，报名的呼拉来了一大群，还都有大专文凭。
    效率与风险结伴，收入与效率相连。昆仑职工创造了高效率：１９８５年产值４５．３万元，１９８８年增加到２０００多万元；“昆仑”在全国已有２８家分公司。职工收入也有较大增长，１９８８年人均收入３０００多元。
    在风险中创造自己的命运，在风险中实现自己的价值。这正是“风雪昆仑山”的吸引力。
    钟蔚身材高大，面皮儿白净，一头的黑发，其实那黑发是染的。他为“昆仑”的发展倾注了心血！实行聘用合同制，辞退过一些职工，难免得罪人。有人给钟蔚打电话，要白刀子进去，红刀子出来。钟蔚回答得干脆：你要是个男子汉就来吧！要怕这个，就不搞改革了。
