	88 photographers from China and abroad will simultaneously start shooting on April 15 — China to be exposed to the world.

	According to a report by our reporter Li Jianxing: On April 15, the lives of the Chinese people will be exposed to the world through the lenses of 88 photographers from China and abroad — this will form the basis for the large-scale photo album "A Day in China," a collaborative effort between China, the United States, and Australia.

	"A Day in China" is the ninth large-scale photo album in the international series "A Day in Life." This series has already published eight albums, including "A Day in the United States," "A Day in Canada," "A Day in Australia," and "A Day in Japan," capturing a day in the ordinary lives of people, reflecting the lives and work of the people in a particular country or region.

	On April 15, 88 renowned photographers from 12 countries, including China, the United States, Britain, France, Iran, and Brazil, will focus their lenses on the vibrant lives of the various ethnic groups of the Chinese people and the soldiers of the Chinese army. Each photographer will take 1,800 photos, and from the 158,400 photos taken, 300 will be selected for publication. The large-scale photo album "A Day in China" will be published in eight languages and distributed to various countries around the world on October 1.
