**Big Waves in the Sea**

Currently, there are over 200,000 CCP members engaged in the individual economy in China, averaging one for every 250 party members. Many have become models of law-abiding operations. By the end of 1988, the number of urban and rural individual industrial and commercial households nationwide had reached over 14 million, with over 23 million people, becoming an important part of China's economy.

The first "high-rise train" in China began trial operations on April 1 on the Shanghai-Nanjing line. The train, produced by the Nanjing Puzhen Vehicle Factory, features double-decker, air-conditioned carriages that are both aesthetically pleasing and comfortable, and can carry 59% more passengers than ordinary trains.

Mongolian youth Bai Yila and Nanjing Railway Medical College staff member Wu Shuli began riding horses around the edges of the country at the end of last year to collect ethnic customs and gather creative materials.

The Chongqing City Dwarfism Research Institute has seen over 6,000 patients in its first year of operation. The founder of the dwarfism specialty is Chen Taixing. It is understood that the institute uses its own patented traditional Chinese medicine for treatment, and some patients have shown significant improvement.
