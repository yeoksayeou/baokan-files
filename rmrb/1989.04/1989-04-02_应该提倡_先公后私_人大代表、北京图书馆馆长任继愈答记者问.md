	Should We Advocate "Public Before Private"
	— People's Congress Representative, Beijing Library Director Ren Jiyu Answers Journalist Questions

	Reporter: Why is there confusion in moral concepts today?

	Answer: One reason is that we are not adequately prepared for modernization, and another is that we are not adequately prepared for the collision and exchange between Eastern and Western cultures.

	When we talk about modernization, we often only discuss per capita income and when we will achieve a moderately prosperous society, while neglecting the inheritance and promotion of national spirit and culture. This is a mistake. The development of productive forces is an important standard, but it is not the only standard.

	Western culture has an active and progressive side, but it also has some decay and problems. Selecting the essence and discarding the dross is a good wish; but as a culture, its positive and negative aspects often coexist and are inseparable. There is a foreign joke that says someone built a three-story house and found the third floor most satisfying, but complained that the first and second floors were unnecessary and should not have been built. Are we somewhat like this now?

	Reporter: Doesn't our cultural tradition also have this coexistence?

	Answer: Yes. We have not criticized feudalism enough, and the harm of feudal ideology is still at work. For example, the patriarchal system is linked with the small peasant economy. The small peasant economy must have a patriarch, which is natural and reasonable in feudal society, but in democratic construction, the patriarchal system becomes an obstacle. The small peasant economy protected and supported the revolution during the war, but in developing socialized large-scale production, it is eager to pursue small-scale and comprehensive development. Other issues like egalitarianism, forming cliques, and nepotism are all related to feudal ideology. Therefore, we should learn more history. Let the people understand that achieving modernization is a historical mission of the entire nation, and thus strive together to complete this mission.

	There is another phenomenon that I am very worried about, which is the lag in theory. Our theoretical work has not done much forward-looking exploration. We do not cherish our theoretical workers enough and should allow them to make mistakes. How many mistakes have we made in economic decision-making? Who has seriously investigated them? Education and theory are our current weakest links.

	Reporter: What kind of moral standards do you think we should advocate?

	Answer: "Great public spirit, selflessness" is not achievable. A person cannot survive and develop without any private interests. "I for others, others for me" is a slogan from the cooperative period and still has a strong utilitarian color. I think since we are pursuing Chinese-style socialism, we should advocate "public before private" and "personal interests subordinate to collective interests."

　　应该提倡“先公后私”
    ——人大代表、北京图书馆馆长任继愈答记者问
    本报记者  莫新元
    记者问：为什么现在会出现道德观念上的混乱？
    答：一是对现代化的认识准备不足，一是对东西方文化的碰撞和交流准备不足。
    我们一谈现代化，往往只讲人均收入多少、何时达到小康，而忽视了民族精神、民族文化的继承和弘扬，这是一个失误。生产力的发展是一个重要标准，但不是唯一的标准。
    西方文化中有积极、进取的一面，同时也存在着一些腐朽和弊病。取其精华，弃其糟粕，是一种良好愿望；但作为一种文化，其积极的东西和消极的东西往往是共生的，不可分的。国外有一个笑话，说某人盖了一栋三层楼房，他发现第三层最合心意，就抱怨一二层是多余的，不该建。我们现在是不是有些类似呢？
    问：我们的文化传统中，也存在着这种共生性吧？
    答：是的。我们对封建主义批判得不够，封建思想的毒害仍在起作用。例如家长制是与小农经济联系在一起的。小农经济必须要有一个家长，这在封建社会是自然的、合理的，可是现在进行民主建设，家长制就成为一个障碍。小农经济在战争年代保护和支持过革命，可是在发展社会化大生产时，又热衷于搞小而全、大而全。其它如平均主义、拉帮结伙、任人唯亲等等，都同封建主义思想有关。所以，我们应该多学一些历史。使人民群众认识到实现现代化是全民族的历史使命，从而为完成这一使命而共同奋斗。
    还有一个现象我很担忧，就是理论落后。我们的理论工作，没有做多少超前探索。我们现在对理论工作者爱护不够，应该允许他们犯错误。我们在经济决策上出现那么多失误，谁认真追究过？一个教育，一个理论，是我们当前最薄弱的环节。
    问：您认为应该提倡什么样的道德标准？
    答：“大公无私”、“毫不利己，专门利人”是做不到的。一点儿私都没有，一个人无法生存和发展。“我为人人，人人为我”是合作化时期的口号，仍有较强的实利主义色彩。我觉得既然是搞中国式的社会主义，应该提倡“先公后私”、“个人利益服从集体利益”。
