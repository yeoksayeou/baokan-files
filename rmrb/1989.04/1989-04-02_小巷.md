This is an alleyway with a unique character. The path is paved with round, smooth pebbles of the same size, and in the middle, there are flat stones of uniform length and width, with the ends protruding and the middle sunken, resembling a flattened carrying pole. People call it "Flat Pole Alley." Although one end of the "pole" curves slightly outward, revealing the bustling streets, the alleyway is still hidden behind tall buildings and walls, unknown to outsiders.

This is a quiet alleyway. In the mornings, I run here; in the evenings, I take a stroll, enjoying the leisurely demeanor of those who lean out of their windows, chatting with neighbors while keeping an eye on passersby. On summer nights, I cool off here, watching groups of neighbors fan themselves while chatting about anything and everything. I often think that the people living in this alleyway, though they can't enjoy the sunrise and sunset like those in high-rise buildings, still have a natural, simple charm. This kind of charm is something that residents of bustling urban areas probably can't appreciate.

Every time I pass through the bustling streets, I feel an inexplicable worry. I fear that with the acceleration of reform, the tranquility of the alleyway might be disrupted. Soon, my worries came true.

Last spring, a small eatery suddenly appeared in the alleyway. The shop was small, with three bays, newly renovated. A signboard reading "Prosperous Restaurant" hung above the doorframe. The owner was a father and son duo; the father, De Wang, was a renowned chef who had just retired from a famous restaurant in the city, naturally taking charge of the kitchen. The son, a high school dropout, was in charge of serving customers. The opening of the shop attracted much attention. The father and son worked in perfect harmony, and business boomed. The dishes' colors, aromas, and tastes truly opened the eyes and appetites of many, who willingly became regular customers.

Not long after, a "Beauty Salon" opened for business. The owners were two sisters; the elder sister was 22, and the younger sister was 20. The elder sister had a charming oval face, while the younger sister had an adorable baby face. They both wore the same jeans and bat-wing shirts, but the elder sister had a youthful hairstyle, appearing carefree, while the younger sister's wavy perm was quite elegant. The sisters learned their craft from people in Guangzhou, and a sign reading "Guangzhou Perms" hung prominently at the shop's entrance. They creatively installed two speakers at the entrance, playing popular songs all day, attracting all the young women, daughters-in-law, and young men in the alleyway...

By now, the alleyway is filled with clothing, hardware, barber, photography, sewing, and general stores, all popping up like mushrooms after rain, amidst the sound of firecrackers. The exterior decorations are exquisite, with each shop displaying unique signs and playing catchy popular tunes to attract customers. The alleyway is filled with countless stalls, selling clothes and fabrics, various handicraft jewelry, and all kinds of specialty snacks. Even the narrowest alleyways can't resist the steps of opening up and activating the economy, and even the most crowded buildings can't hide the eyes of the peddlers. Every day, the sounds of peddling never cease. These sounds are either bright and melodious, or deep and resonant, or rich and clear, all very pleasant to the ear, not at all bothersome.

Flat Pole Alley, though I cherish the past tranquility and serenity, I am even more thrilled by today's bustling activity!

　　小巷
　　聂永清
    这是一条别具一格的小巷。巷道嵌着大小一样圆滚滚光溜溜的鹅卵石，中间铺着长短相同宽窄一致的青石，两头凸中间凹，形如一根压了斤两的扁担，人们称它“扁担巷”。尽管“扁担”的那一头略略拐出去，便可见繁华的街市，但小巷毕竟为高楼大墙所遮住，不为外人知晓。
    这是条幽静的小巷。清晨，我在这里跑步；傍晚，我在这里散步，领略那些俯在自家窗上，一面打量下面的行人，一面与邻居闲聊的人们的悠然情趣。夏夜，我在这里乘凉，观看三三两两的邻居们一边摇着蒲扇，一边天南地北闲扯的有趣情景……我常常想，居住在这条小巷里的人们，虽然不能像住在高楼大厦里的人们那样朝观日出，暮看晚霞，倒也有一点自然天真别趣。这中间的情趣，怕是那些住在闹市区的人们不能领略得到的吧？
    每每经过热闹繁华的街市，我总有一种莫名其妙的担忧。我怕，在改革的节奏加快以后，有可能打破小巷的静谥。不久，我的担忧应验了。
    去年春天，小巷里突然冒出了一家小吃店。店面不大，三开间。是修葺一新的。门框上搁着一块“兴旺饭店”横匾，开店的父子俩，父亲是刚从城里有名的“津津饭馆”退休的德旺大师傅，自然由他掌勺。儿子高考落榜生，当然让他跑堂。小店开业很引人注目，父子俩配合默契，生意暴旺，那菜肴的色香味，确是使很多人眼界大开食欲大增，心甘情愿地成了它的座上客。
    过不多久，一家“美容店”又开张营业了。店主人是姐妹俩，姐姐芳龄２２，妹妹２０。姐姐生就一张迷人的瓜子脸，妹妹天生一副可爱的娃娃脸。一样的牛仔裤，一样的蝙蝠衫，不同的是姐姐“青年式”发型，显得潇洒，妹妹的“波浪型”烫发，相当飘逸。姐妹俩师承广州人，店门口赫然挂出“广州烫发”的牌子。她们别出心裁地在店门口安装了两个音箱，一天到晚播放流行歌曲，把小巷的姑娘媳妇和青年小伙子全都吸引了去……
    嘿，到眼前，小巷里服装、五金、理发、照像、缝纫、百货，一家家店铺像雨后春笋般在鞭炮声中冒了出来。外部装潢考究，家家店铺挂起招牌，亮出了别具匠心的旗号，飘出了招徕顾客的悦耳的流行曲。巷道里流动着无数个货摊，卖衣服布料的，兜售各式工艺首饰的，叫卖各种山货的，应有尽有。再窄的巷道也禁不住开放搞活的脚步，再挤挨的楼房也遮不住小贩们的眼睛。每天，各种叫卖声不绝于耳。这声音或嘹亮、婉转，或雄浑、粗犷，或浑厚、清丽，听来韵味十足，一点也不噪耳。
    扁担巷，我虽留恋过去的幽静和宁谧，但更为今日的繁华热闹而欢呼！
