On the morning of March 12, around 5:30 AM, I went to Shanghai Railway Station to buy a ticket back to Kaifeng. After waiting in line at the ticket counter for less than ten minutes, eight ticket scalpers approached me one after another, asking if I needed a ticket. I asked them how much a ticket to Kaifeng would cost. The scalpers said a hard seat ticket was 30 yuan (13.6 yuan more than the official price), and a hard sleeper ticket was 120 yuan (93.5 yuan more than the official price). This blatant scalping of train tickets is outrageous! I immediately reported this to two station employees, who told me to find the security personnel. I looked for them twice but couldn't find anyone. At that moment, I saw someone selling platform tickets at a high price, 2 yuan each. I intentionally struck up a conversation with one of the scalpers, who quietly told me that he had a job and scalped tickets in his spare time to make extra money.

　　上海火车站有人倒车票
    三月十二日早上五点多钟，我到上海火车站买车票回开封，在售票处排队不到十分钟，就有八个票贩子先后问我要不要车票。我问他们，去开封多少钱一张票？票贩子说硬座票每张三十元（高出规定价格十三元六角），硬卧票一百二十元（高出规定价九十三元五角）。如此公开倒卖车票，太不像话了！我立即向两个车站工作人员反映，他们让我找治安人员，我找了两次都没找到。这时，我又看到有人在高价倒卖站台票，每张二元。我有意和一个票贩子搭话，他悄悄告诉我，他有工作，业余时间倒票搞外快。
