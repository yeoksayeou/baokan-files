The workers at the Boshan Cement Factory see the 52-year-old factory director, Fu Qingfu, as someone who genuinely cares for the employees. He bows three times to the families of his subordinates and celebrates the birthdays of older workers.

Fu Qingfu requires all middle-level cadres in the factory to arrive half an hour early to prepare for the day's work. The factory's production is tightly managed, and the cadres work longer hours than the workers, leaving less time for family. Feeling guilty, Fu makes it a point to invite the families of these cadres to the factory during holidays. He serves them fruit and tea, and bows three times. The first bow is to thank them for supporting the enterprise, the second is to apologize for the cadres' lack of time for family, and the third is to invite them to voice any complaints or grievances. These heartfelt words often move the families, who respond, "Director Fu, my husband doesn't listen to me, but I'll make sure he does!"

During the New Year's dialogue meeting a couple of years ago, an elderly worker asked Fu, "Director, the young people in our factory have everything they need, but do you ever think about us older workers?" This question deeply moved Fu, who immediately took action. First, the factory's trade union organized disco and fitness classes for middle-aged and elderly workers. Then, he established a rule to celebrate the birthdays of workers over 40. On these occasions, the factory director and secretary would raise a toast, wish everyone a happy birthday, and present a gift to the birthday celebrant.

Fu has been the factory director for four years, working in a modest office. He used the funds approved by higher authorities to build an office building to improve the living conditions of the workers and the production environment. He loves basketball (he is even a second-level basketball referee), calligraphy, dancing, and chess. He often says, "If it can help me connect with the workers, I'll do it."

In management terms, management should focus on behavioral science. In Fu's words, "The work of a factory director should have a human touch."

Of course, to motivate the enthusiasm of the workers, "human touch" is one aspect, but establishing rules and incentives is also crucial. Fu's "standardized work method" has been promoted nationwide.

In just three years, without increasing personnel or equipment, the Boshan Cement Factory increased its annual cement production from 280,000 tons to 450,000 tons. Profits and taxes rose from 6.38 million yuan to 15.51 million yuan. In 1988, Fu was named one of the top 20 outstanding entrepreneurs in the second national competition.

　　企业家的人情味
    本报记者　宋学春　王彦田
    给部下家属三鞠躬，给工人祝寿……，在博山水泥厂工人看来，５２岁的厂长傅庆馥心里装着职工呢！
    傅庆馥要求全厂中层干部，每天必须提前半小时上班，做好上班前的各项准备工作。厂里生产抓得紧，干部比工人工作时间长，顾家的时间少。老傅过意不去，逢年过节，他的第一件事就是把这些干部的家属请到厂里，摆上几盘水果，端上一杯清茶，恭恭正正地给大家鞠三个躬。一鞠躬，感谢贤内助对企业的支持；再鞠躬，给大家道歉：干部没有精力照顾家；三鞠躬，请有意见的提意见，有牢骚的发牢骚，出出气。几句真情话，家属们也动了感情：“老傅啊，俺那口子不听话，我来管他！”
    前年新春对话会，有个老工人问傅庆馥：咱厂年轻人吃的玩的都有，厂长惦记我们老职工没有？一句话，老傅感触深切，马上采取措施：先是由厂工会举办中老年迪斯科、健身操辅导班。然后定下规矩，为４０岁以上的老职工祝寿。届时，厂长、书记把盏，祝大家生日愉快，再赠上一个老寿星。
    傅庆馥出任厂长４年，在平房办公，把上级批准建办公大楼的资金全部用于改善职工生活、生产条件。他喜爱篮球（还是篮球二级裁判呢），书法、跳舞、棋类，他自己常说，能联系职工感情的事，能干就干。
    用管理学的术语讲，管理要注重行为科学。用傅庆馥的话说，厂长工作要有人情味。
    当然，调动职工积极性，“人情味”是一方面，制定规范的约束激励更是不可少。傅庆馥创造的“规范工作法”已在全国宣传推广。
    博山水泥厂３年内，在人员、设备不增加的情况下，水泥年产量由２８万吨增加到４５万吨，实现利税由６３８万元提高到１５５１万元，１９８８年，傅庆馥进入第二届２０名全国优秀企业家行列。
