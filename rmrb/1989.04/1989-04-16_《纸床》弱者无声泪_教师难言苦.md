To spark societal reflection on the issue of teachers' remuneration, the Liaoning Television Drama Production Center recently released the television drama "The Paper Bed."

The screen, stained with blood, gradually fades, and amidst the milky white, the cries of a newborn baby can be heard. A wordless lullaby begins from afar, and a figure walks alone from the distant green mountains. The bewildered eyes of the red-clothed girl Xia Qiu gaze at the scene of her parents making love. Everything is silent. A 7-square-meter low room cannot be divided further, and for 16 years, two generations have had to sleep on a single small bed. The doctor says that long-term use of a single sleeping posture and a certain psychological abnormality are the root causes of Xia Qiu's leukemia. Xia Qiu dies on the morning of the first day of the Lunar New Year. Her mother, Xia Mi, carefully folds the application for housing into a bed and places it in the river, which is reddened by the rising sun. The paper bed floats away and sinks. On the blood-red river surface, the echoes of Xia Qiu's dreams and calls for a bed resonate. The wordless lullaby begins again.

At the discussion meeting, someone said, "The Paper Bed" is a screen poem.

　　《纸床》弱者无声泪　教师难言苦
    本报讯　为了引发社会对教师待遇问题的思考，辽宁电视剧制作中心最近推出电视单本剧《纸床》。
    血染的屏幕逐渐淡化，乳白色中传来初生婴儿的啼哭，无字的儿歌声起自远方，有人影独自从黛青色的远山走近……红衣女孩小秋困惑的眼神凝视着父母作爱的场面。一切都是无言的。７平方米的矮房无法再行分割，１６年中，两代人只能睡在一张小床上。大夫讲，长期一种睡姿和某种心理变态是小秋白血病的根源。小秋在大年初一早晨死去，母亲向小米将住房申请细心地折叠成一张床，放在旭日染红的河流中。纸床漂走了，沉没了。如血的河面上回荡着小秋对床的梦幻与呼唤。无字的儿歌声再起。
　　研讨会上有人说，《纸床》是一首屏幕诗。　（王前海）
