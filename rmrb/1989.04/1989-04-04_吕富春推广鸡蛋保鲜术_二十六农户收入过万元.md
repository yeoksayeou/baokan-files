Lu Fuchun, a cadre from Dayue Township in Mi County, Henan Province, has promoted his own invention of an egg preservation technique. Last year, this technique helped 326 households become wealthy, with incomes reaching over 2,000 yuan, and 26 households earning over 10,000 yuan. Chickens lay eggs seasonally. The usual method of refrigeration requires storage rooms, electrical equipment, and a large amount of electricity. Each 100 eggs stored requires an investment of about 2 yuan. Zhengzhou City spends over 2 million yuan annually on subsidies for the city's egg supply. Refrigerated eggs start to "spoil" after six months. Lu Fuchun uses a sodium ion solution to soak the eggs, which costs only 2 fen per 100 eggs, ensuring that the eggs remain fresh for up to 10 months.

This way, a large number of eggs purchased during the peak season can be stored and sold during the off-season or on holidays, increasing the investment value by more than 70%. This technology is easy to promote.

　　吕富春推广鸡蛋保鲜术  二十六农户收入过万元
    本报讯  河南省密县大隗乡干部吕富春推广自己发明的鸡蛋保鲜技术，去年一年使３２６户农民致富，收入达２０００元以上，其中有万元户２６个。鸡产蛋季节性强。通常采用的冷藏法，需要库房、机电设备和大量电力。每贮存１００只鸡蛋，需投资约两元。郑州市一年用于市民鸡蛋供应的补贴超过２００万元。冷藏的鸡蛋，六个月后即开始“散黄”。吕富春采用钠离子溶液浸泡鸡蛋的保鲜法，每百只鸡蛋只需投资２分钱，即可保证贮存１０个月后仍新鲜如初。
    这样，在旺季大量购进的鸡蛋，就可以储存到淡季或节日出售，使投资增值７０％以上。这项技术容易推广。
