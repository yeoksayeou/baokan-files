    In the cotton bales sent from Shandong's Yanzhou to the Benxi Second Textile Mill, sand and other impurities accounted for about 1/3, and there were even 12,000 bricks. People are asking—

    When Will the Practice of Adulteration End?

    By Duan Xinqiang, Reporter for the People's Daily

    On April 18, a rare case of raw material adulteration was discovered in Benxi City, Liaoning Province.

    The Benxi Second Textile Mill, which was "waiting for the rice to cook," received three train cars of 120 tons of cotton in 1,233 bales from Shandong's Yanzhou Railway Station. They were overjoyed and immediately started pulling the cotton from the station to the factory at night. During the unloading process, a few whole bricks fell out of the bales, drawing attention. They immediately contacted the relevant departments for inspection and found 12,000 bricks mixed in the cotton bales. Additionally, there were many sand, old shoes, wood, and rotten cotton seeds, accounting for about 1/3 of the total weight. As a result, the factory suffered a loss of nearly 400,000 yuan.

    When the reporter arrived at the scene, personnel from the factory, railway, and police were present and breaking open the bales. The reporter saw that the outside of the cotton bales was a layer of substandard cotton, and inside were rows of red bricks or brick blanks, piles of sand, and bricks mixed with sand...

    It is reported that such cases of raw material adulteration have become quite common. Some people mix impurities into the cotton and also put in some canned goods to silence the workers. Enterprises have long had opinions about these phenomena, but for the sake of production, they sometimes have to swallow their anger and fear losing the source of raw materials.

    At meetings convened by the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Textile Industry, enterprises have expressed their grievances and raised objections. However, from top to bottom, there are more nods than actions; more circles drawn than actual work done. The problem is passed around like a ball. As a result, those who adulterate become bolder, and their methods become more malicious. People call for relevant departments to take coordinated action and adopt effective measures to stop this harmful behavior.

    山东兖州发给本溪第二纺织厂的棉花包中，沙土杂物约占１／３，甚至有砖１．２万块。人们质问——
    掺假之风何时了
    本报记者　段心强
    ４月１８日，辽宁省本溪市发现一起罕见的原料掺假事件。
    正“等米下锅”的本溪第二纺织厂接到从山东兖州火车站发来的三车皮１２０吨１２３３包棉花，欢喜不已，连夜从火车站往厂里拉。搬运中，突然从包里掉下几块整砖，引起注意。他们马上找有关部门检查，共在棉花包里发现掺砖１．２万来块。另外，掺有许多沙土、旧鞋、木头、烂棉籽，约占总重量的１／３。为此，工厂损失近４０万元。
    记者赶到现场时，工厂、铁路、警察三方人员正在破包。记者看到棉花包外边是一层等外棉，里边有的是一排排红砖或砖坯子，有的是一堆堆沙土，有的砖沙相杂……
    据悉，像这种原料掺假事件已经屡见不鲜。有的在往棉花掺杂物的同时，还放进一些罐头，目的是堵工人的嘴。对这些现象，企业早就意见很大，但为了生产，有时不得不忍气吞声，怕断了原料来源。
    在商业部、纺织工业部召开的会议上，企业对此发过牢骚，提过意见。但从上到下，点头的多，动手的少；画圈的多，办事的少。问题被当成皮球踢来踢去。结果是掺假的人胆子越来越大，掺假的手段越来越恶劣。人们呼吁，有关部门应协同行动，采取有效措施，制止这种损人利己的行为。
