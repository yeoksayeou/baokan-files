The People's Daily, Belgrade, April 5th - Reporter Yan Zheng reports: Today, the Kosovo Autonomous Province's Executive Council held a meeting to discuss the situation in Kosovo and the responsibilities of the Executive Council and its members. To take "objective and personal responsibility" for the situation in Kosovo, the Chairman of the Kosovo Executive Council, Rexhep Kollëgjeci, resigned during the meeting.

The meeting's communiqué pointed out: The implementation of the Federal Presidency's special measures has had and continues to have a clear promoting effect on the normalization of the political and security situation in the autonomous province. Currently, the economic and social activities in the autonomous province are increasingly returning to normal, and the production situation in all mining areas in Kosovo has also improved significantly compared to the previous period.

The communiqué also pointed out that although the political and security situation in the autonomous province has normalized to a certain extent, it remains extremely difficult and complex. It is necessary to continue to seriously implement the Federal Presidency's special measures and carry out political and ideological work.

The Kosovo Executive Council expressed its willingness to take partial responsibility for the extremely complex political and security situation in the autonomous province.
