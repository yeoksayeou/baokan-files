Hospitals Struggle with Deficits, Patients Complain About Fees
Medical System Reform Faces New Challenges: Seeking Effective Constraints
By Ai Xiao, People's Daily Reporter

Cai Renhua, Associate Professor of Health Economics, born in 1939, graduated from the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences in 1961. He previously served as the Deputy Director of the Health Management Department at the Second Military Medical University. For many years, he has been engaged in research and teaching in health economics and has authored books such as "Health Economics." He recently took up the position of Deputy Director of the Policy and Law Department at the Ministry of Health.

Reporter: From an economic perspective, many people believe that whether hospitals can thrive depends on whether medical services can be reasonably compensated. In recent years, reforms in hospital management have sparked considerable controversy in society. Whether it is the demand side or the supply side of medical services, both feel that "compensation is not reasonable." What is your opinion?

Cai Renhua: To discuss whether compensation is reasonable, we must first understand the methods of compensation. Currently, hospitals generally have three compensation models to choose from.

The first is the "budget compensation model," where the government allocates budget funds for hospitals to provide health services to society. Its main advantage is that the state can macroscopically control the amount of expenses and their growth rate, and can make basic medical and health services more equitable for low-income groups. The disadvantage is that hospitals lack the autonomy to operate and develop independently, relying on "state subsidies," and the supply-demand contradiction is prominent.

The second is the "market operation compensation model," where hospitals determine the cost and price of medical services based on actual labor consumption and market supply-demand conditions, and charge fees accordingly, with no government subsidies. Its biggest advantage is that hospitals can operate independently without relying on "blood transfusions," actively providing services to the market and alleviating supply-demand contradictions. The disadvantage is that hospitals and their staff often overlook social affordability when pursuing profits, leading to the provision of excessive services and wasting social resources.

The third is the "dual compound compensation model," where budget quotas and service operation income are combined and run on two tracks. In practice, the compound compensation model often shows obvious "interest bias" as compensation conditions change. When budget subsidies are the main compensation channel, hospitals' behavior tends to rely on "waiting, depending, and asking"; when service operation income becomes the main source of subsidies, it automatically shifts to utilizing the service market.

Reporter: It seems that the three compensation models each have their pros and cons. Only by compensating effectively can we achieve reasonableness.

Cai Renhua: Yes, currently, there is an interesting phenomenon internationally where two types of models are mutually complementary. Countries like the Soviet Union and Britain, which have long implemented the budget compensation model, are introducing market operation mechanisms to restore the vitality of hospitals; while countries like the United States, which have long adopted a single market operation compensation model, are gradually introducing "pre-control" budget measures. Now, both sides have seen initial results.

In China, health and epidemic prevention, preventive health care, medical education institutions, enterprises, and military hospitals that do not open to the public have traditionally adopted the budget compensation model; public hospitals have adopted a modified dual compound compensation model since the early 1950s (first, the state does not account for the depreciation of fixed assets, and there are special funds for house repairs and equipment updates; second, the state provides hospitals with tax-free sales of Chinese and Western medicines). In recent years, hospital management system reforms have generally not broken through the compound compensation model. Instead, after policy relaxation, market operation compensation has become more prominent in the dual compensation model, forming a "compound compensation, with market operation compensation as the main" pattern. This trend, coupled with the exposure of inherent flaws in the market operation compensation model after the partial introduction of "operational compensation" in the preventive health care sector, has led to confusion about medical reforms.

Reporter: From some phenomena, it can be seen that once compensation leans towards market operations, it is easy to trigger the "production for revenue" mechanism to accelerate. Currently, the strategies adopted by hospitals such as "medical losses compensated by drug sales," "drug sales controlled by examinations," and "main business in distress, auxiliary business compensates" are of what nature?

Cai Renhua: I believe this is an inevitable institutional phenomenon of the compound compensation model. Because currently in China, medical services provided to society are still operating at a loss, and the main channel for hospitals to "exchange production for revenue" is far from smooth. To break through the old rigid system, it is necessary to seek reasonable compensation through various auxiliary channels, which should be fully understood.

Reporter: However, due to the micro-level interests of units and individuals, some hospitals currently exhibit tendencies such as "emphasizing quantity over quality," "emphasizing drugs over medicine," "emphasizing auxiliary over main," and "emphasizing profit over virtue," as well as serious consequences, which should also be fully considered.

Cai Renhua: You are correct. In rectification and regulation, it is necessary to distinguish between different natures and strictly draw the line. Institutional phenomena can only be addressed through deepening reforms to eliminate shortcomings and gradually improve the new compensation mechanism; for irregularities such as selling drugs indiscriminately and conducting excessive examinations, serious criticism and strict regulation are necessary; for those who accept red envelopes, kickbacks, and sell non-medical items as medicines, economic, administrative, and legal measures should be comprehensively used for punishment. Our current urgent task is to establish a constraint mechanism from macro to micro levels.

Reporter: Where should we start?

Cai Renhua: Efforts should be made in three areas. First, from the micro-level activities. The current service charging method in hospitals, which is based on the number of visits, bed days, and projects, should gradually transition to charging based on "standard disease treatment cost plans." Under the constraint of the "disease charging amount," if the hospital can minimize waste during the treatment process, it can save costs and benefit; if it increases necessary examinations, it will incur additional costs. This makes the hospital actively provide effective services without increasing the patient's expenses beyond the disease quota. Second, in macro management. Currently, there is an overlapping relationship between hospitals and their supervising bureaus, which to some extent weakens the macro-management function of the supervising bureaus, and their constraints on hospitals can only be "soft" constraints. To make the constraints "hard," it is necessary to separate the owner and manager functions of the government supervising departments. Third, the demand side of medical services can also constrain the hospital's operations. Reforming the medical and health care system and establishing a new medical insurance and guarantee system where the government, collectives, and individuals share medical expenses reasonably should be put on the agenda as soon as possible.

　　医院愁亏损　患者怨收费
    医疗体制改革面临新课题——
    寻求有效约束机制
    本报记者  艾笑
    蔡仁华　卫生经济学副教授，１９３９年生，１９６１年毕业于上海社会科学院。曾任上海第二医科大学卫生管理系副主任。多年从事卫生经济学研究和教学，著有《卫生经济学》等书。最近调任卫生部政策法规司副司长。
    记者：从经济观点看，不少人认为医院能不能搞活，取决于医疗服务劳动是否能得到合理的补偿。近年来，为此进行的医院管理体制改革，在社会上引出不少争议，不管是医疗服务的需方，还是供方，都深感“补偿不合理”。您的看法怎样？
    蔡仁华：要谈补偿的合理与否，先要了解补偿的方式，现在可供医院选择的一般是３种补偿模式。
    第一种是“预算补偿模式”，即政府拨出预算经费，由医院对社会成员提供卫生服务。它的主要优点是，国家宏观上容易控制费用的数额及其增长速度，并能使低收入阶层较公平地获得基本的医疗卫生服务。缺点是医院没有自主经营、自我更新发展的能力，安于吃“皇粮”，供需矛盾突出。
    第二种是“市场经营补偿模式”，即医院按实际劳动消耗和市场的供需情况，确定医疗服务的成本和价格，计价收费，政府不给补偿性拨款。它的最大优点是医院可不依赖“输血”，主动面向市场提供服务，缓解供需矛盾。缺点是医院及其职工在追求利益时，往往忽视社会负担能力而提供过度的服务，导致社会资源浪费。
    第三种是“双重复合补偿模式”，即预算定额补贴加服务经营收入双向合流、双轨运转。在实践中，复合补偿模式经常随着补偿条件的转化发生明显的“利益倾斜”。当预算补贴作为补偿主渠道时，医院的行为取向就侧重“等、靠、要”；当服务经营收入成为主要补贴来源时，它则自动转向利用服务市场。
    记者：这样看来，３种补偿模式各有利弊，只有兴利除弊的补偿，才能做到合理喽。
    蔡仁华：是的，目前国际上正在出现两类模式互相取长补短的有趣现象。多年实行预算补偿模式的苏联、英国等，都在引进市场经营机制恢复医院的活力；而美国等长期采用单一市场经营补偿模式的国家，则正逐步引进“事前控制”的预算性办法。现在，双方都已初见成效。
    我国卫生防疫、预防保健、医学教育机构及企业、部队等不对外开放的医院，以往多采取预算补偿模式；公有制医院早在５０年代初就采取了经过“修补”（一是国家对医院不计固定资产消耗，房屋维修和设备更新都有专项拨款；二是国家给予医院免税经销中西药品的优惠）的双重复合补偿模式。
    近几年的医院管理体制改革，总的说来并没有突破复合补偿模式，只是政策放宽后，市场经营补偿在双重补偿中的地位突出了，形成“复合补偿、以市场经营补偿为主”的格局。这种趋势，加上预防保健部门局部引进“经营补偿”后市场经营补偿模式固有弊病显露，人们就产生了对医疗改革的困惑。
    记者：从一些现象分析，补偿一旦倾向于市场经营为主，便容易诱发“以产换收”的机制加快运转。当前医院所采取的“医务亏损卖药补”、“卖药受控检验补”、“主业窘困副业补”的对策，是属于什么性质呢？
    蔡仁华：我认为这是复合补偿模式不可避免的体制现象。因为当前在我国，为社会提供的医疗劳务仍是亏损经营，医院“以产换收”的主渠道远没畅通。要突破旧有的僵化体制，不得不通过多种辅助渠道来谋求合理补偿，对此应予充分理解。
    记者：可是，由于单位和个人微观利益的牵动，当前一些医院里出现的“重量轻质”、“重药轻医”、“重副轻主”、“重利轻德”的偏向及严重后果也应当充分重视。
    蔡仁华：你说得对。在治理和整顿中应当区分性质、严格划清界限。体制现象，只有通过深化改革来扬长避短，使新的补偿机制逐步完善；对乱卖药和滥检查等不正之风，必须严肃批评严加管束；对那些收红包、吃回扣、百货冒充药品卖等违法乱纪的，应当运用经济、行政、法律手段综合惩处。我们现在的当务之急是建立从宏观到微观的约束机制。
    记者：这应该从哪里下手？
    蔡仁华：宜从３方面努力。第一，从微观活动方面。医院现在这种以人次、床日、项目计量的服务收费方式，应逐步过渡到按“标准病种计划治疗成本”收费。医院在规定好的“病种收费额”制约下，治疗过程中如果能尽量减少浪费现象，就可节支得益，倘若增加必要的检查，就会增耗吃亏。这就使医院既积极提供有效服务，又不增加患者病种定额外的开支。第二，在宏观管理方面。目前医院与其主管局之间存在着利益交叉渗透的关系，这在一定程度上削弱了主管局的宏观管理职能，它对医院的约束只能是“软”约束。要使约束“硬化”，只有促使政府主管部门的所有者和管理者两个职能分离。第三，医疗服务的需方也可以对医院的经营活动加以约束。改革医疗保健制度，建立医疗费用由政府、集体、个人各方合理分担的新型医疗保险、保障体制，必须尽快提上日程。
