People's Daily, Beijing, April 14th - Reporter Bi Quan Zhong: The State Education Commission has decided to conduct a comprehensive inspection of primary and secondary education nationwide to quickly create a good environment for teaching and educating. The decision and inspection outline will be notified to all regions on April 15th.

In recent years, several important issues have emerged in primary and secondary education, attracting widespread attention from all sectors of society. These issues include: insufficient education funds, deteriorating school conditions, failure to implement policies to improve teachers' economic benefits in some places, student dropouts, relaxation of moral education, and schools charging excessive fees. The State Education Commission has decided to conduct a large-scale inspection and supervision of primary and secondary education nationwide, similar to the inspections of finance, taxation, and prices.

The State Education Commission has decided that the content and requirements of this inspection and supervision will focus on the following five aspects:

1. **Inspect the implementation of policies for increasing education funds and teachers' economic benefits.** Require local governments to allocate education funds according to the central government's "two increases" policy, and ensure that the per-student public funds actually available increase year over year. Public and private school teachers should receive their entitled salaries and benefits, and public school teachers should receive their entitled public medical benefits, all in accordance with national and local policies, without delays or arrears.

2. **Inspect the renovation of dangerous school buildings.** Require local governments to formulate plans to address dangerous buildings and implement them as soon as possible, aiming to eliminate severe dangerous buildings this year.

3. **Inspect the control of student dropouts.** Require the control of dropout phenomena, reducing the dropout rate of in-school students to the general level of previous years.

4. **Inspect the rectification of excessive fees.** Require provincial, autonomous region, and municipal governments to formulate specific regulations for reasonable fees and immediately stop the implementation of unreasonable fee items and standards set by schools, clearing up excessive fee phenomena.

5. **Inspect the implementation of the "Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Reforming and Strengthening Moral Education in Primary and Secondary Schools."** Require timely dissemination and organization of the study of the "Notice," formulate implementation measures, and begin daily behavioral training for primary and secondary school students according to the norms.

The State Education Commission's notice states: This inspection and supervision will primarily be organized by local governments conducting self-inspections according to the requirements of the State Education Commission. Higher-level governments can dispatch inspection and supervision teams composed of inspectors and relevant department personnel to conduct necessary inspections and supervision of the regions under their jurisdiction.

    本报北京四月十四日讯　记者毕全忠报道：国家教委决定对全国中小学教育事业开展大检查，以尽快造就良好教书育人环境。这项决定和检查的提纲将于四月十五日通知各地。
    近年来中小学教育事业中出现了一些重要问题，引起了社会各界的普遍关注，如：教育经费紧缺、办学条件恶化、一些地方提高教师经济待遇的政策措施未获落实、学生辍学、德育放松、一些学校乱收费等等。国家教委决定要像财务、税收、物价大检查那样，在全国范围内对中小学教育事业开展大规模检查、督导。
    国家教委决定这次检查、督导的内容和要求集中在以下五方面：一，查教育经费增长政策和教师经济待遇落实的情况。要求各地按中央规定的“两个增长”政策安排教育经费，并使学生人均实际占有的公用经费比前一年得到增长，公办、民办教师应享受的工资待遇和公办教师的公费医疗待遇等，都按国家和地方的政策规定兑现，不拖欠；二，查校舍中危房改造情况。要求各地制定解决危房的计划并尽早实现，今年消除严重危房；三，查学生流失的制止情况。要求流失现象得到控制，在校生流失率降到常年一般水平；四，查乱收费现象的纠正情况。要求省、自治区、直辖市人民政府制订合理收费的具体规定，并按规定立即停止执行学校自定的不合理收费项目和标准，清理乱收费现象；五，查《中共中央关于改革和加强中小学德育工作的通知》的贯彻情况。要求及时传达和组织学习《通知》，制订落实措施，并开始按中小学学生日常行为规范教育训练。
    国家教委的通知指出：这次检查、督导以各地人民政府按照国家教委的要求组织自检为主，上级政府可派督学人员和有关部门人员相结合的检查、督导小组，对所辖地区进行必要的检查、督导。
