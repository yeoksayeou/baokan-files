    An official from the State Administration for Industry and Commerce reiterated that grain not covered by the state plan will continue to be regulated by the market. Prices will be set by the market, fluctuating with supply and demand. This is what Vice Minister Liu Minxue of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce recently reaffirmed regarding grain market management policies.

    Reports indicate that since last winter and this spring, some urban and rural grain markets in China have seen a reduction in the variety and quantity of grain available, with prices being relatively high. Several factors contribute to this situation, including last year's poor harvest and price fluctuations. Additionally, overly strict grain market regulations have played a role. For instance, some places have closed grain markets, prohibiting farmers from selling surplus grain after fulfilling their state procurement quotas, and preventing grain-deficient households from purchasing grain. These new issues in the grain market have drawn the attention of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce. To implement the State Council's decision from September last year on strengthening grain management and stabilizing the grain market, and to ensure that the grain market is managed but not stifled, and is active but not chaotic, Liu Minxue recently clarified four points regarding grain market management:

    1. Grain (including rice) is not under a monopoly. Strengthening management applies only to planned grain, aiming to address issues such as multiple interventions and price gouging that disrupt the grain market, not to stifle circulation channels.

    2. Grain not covered by the plan will continue to be regulated by the market, with prices set by supply and demand. Farmers' markets should continue to operate as usual.

    3. In regions with contract obligations, before completing contract procurement and "negotiated conversion to planned" tasks, multiple channels of operation are not permitted. However, it is allowed for the public to make minor adjustments in the market, for farmers to exchange grain among themselves, and for individual households and catering businesses to purchase grain at local markets for self-use, but not to engage in price gouging, hoarding, or reselling.

    4. After completing the state contract procurement tasks at the county level, except for rice, multiple channels of operation are permitted.

### 国家工商局负责人重申  计划外粮食仍由市场调节

　　国家工商局负责人重申
    计划外粮食仍由市场调节
    新华社北京４月４日电  （实习生胡顺许）粮食没有实行专营；计划外的粮食仍由市场调节，价格放开，随行就市。这是国家工商行政管理局副局长刘敏学最近重申的粮食市场管理政策。
    据反映，去冬今春以来，我国有的城乡粮食市场粮食上市品种减少，数量下降，价格偏高。出现这种现象，除去年粮食歉收，物价波动等因素外，还与粮食市场管得过死有一定关系。如有的地方关闭了粮食市场，不允许农民完成国家粮食定购任务后上市出售余粮，不许缺粮户购买粮食等。粮食市场出现的这些新问题，已引起国家工商行政管理局的重视。为贯彻执行去年９月国务院《关于加强粮食管理稳定粮食市场的决定》，确保粮食市场管而不死，活而不乱。刘敏学上月初就粮食市场管理问题明确了四条：一、粮食（包括大米）没有实行专营。加强管理是管理计划内的，目的是解决多头插手、哄抬物价，把粮食市场搞乱等问题，不是要把流通渠道搞死。二、计划外的粮食，仍由市场调节，价格放开，随行就市。农贸市场还要像往常一样，继续开放。三、有合同任务的地区，在未完成合同订购和“议转平”任务前，不允许多渠道经营。但应允许群众在市场上进行少量的调剂余缺；允许农民之间交换粮食，允许个体户、饮食业户在当地集市采购粮食自用，但不允许抬价抢购或转手倒卖。四、以县为单位，完成国家合同订购任务后，除大米外，允许多渠道经营。
