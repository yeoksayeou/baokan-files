Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 15th.

The State Council and the Central Military Commission recently issued a notice, requiring all regions to properly address the work transfer and relocation issues of military officers' spouses.

In the notice approving the request from the Ministry of Personnel, the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, and other departments, the State Council and the Central Military Commission pointed out that the People's Liberation Army is responsible for defending the motherland. Military officers (including civilian cadres) and their spouses have made many sacrifices to support military construction. Properly addressing the work transfer and relocation issues of military officers' spouses who meet the conditions for relocation is necessary to alleviate the concerns of military officers, allowing them to focus on the revolutionary, modern, and regularized construction of the military. This is in line with the fundamental interests of the state and the people. All levels of people's governments should treat the proper resolution of military officers' spouses' work transfer and relocation issues as an important task in supporting military construction and strengthening national defense. They should make serious arrangements, supervise and inspect, and ensure implementation. All relevant departments and organizations, institutions, and enterprises should actively support and closely cooperate, while the military should actively coordinate, working together to resolve this issue.

The joint request from the Ministry of Personnel, the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Public Security, and the General Political Department stated that in recent years, military officers' spouses who meet the conditions for relocation and work in local areas have faced difficulties in transferring their jobs. Retired military officers' spouses have also faced difficulties in relocating, resulting in many military couples living apart for extended periods, causing inconveniences in their lives and having a certain impact on military construction. The six departments' joint request proposed five specific opinions on solving the work transfer and relocation issues of military officers' spouses (including retired military officers and civilian cadres' spouses) who meet the conditions for relocation.

　　国务院中央军委发出通知
　　军官配偶工作调动易地安置须妥善解决
    新华社北京４月１５日电　国务院、中央军委最近发出通知，要求各地妥善解决军官配偶工作调动和易地安置问题。
    国务院、中央军委在批转人事部、解放军总政治部等部门关于这个问题的请示的通知中指出，中国人民解放军担负着保卫祖国的重任，军官（含文职干部）配偶为支持军队建设作出了许多牺牲。妥善解决符合随军条件的军官配偶的工作调动和易地安置问题，是解除军官后顾之忧，使他们集中精力从事军队革命化、现代化、正规化建设的需要，是符合国家和人民根本利益的。各级人民政府要把妥善解决军官配偶工作调动和易地安置的问题，作为支持军队建设、巩固和加强国防的一项重要工作来抓，要认真部署，督促检查，保证落实。各有关部门和机关、事业、企业单位要积极支持、密切配合，各部队要主动联系，共同把这件事情办好。
    人事部、劳动部、民政部、财政部、公安部、总政治部的请示报告认为，近几年来，符合随军条件、在地方工作的军官配偶，调动工作比较困难，已经离退休的军官配偶，易地安置很难落实接收管理单位，致使一部分军官夫妻长期两地分居，给他们的生活带来诸多不便，对军队建设也产生了一定影响。六部门的请示报告对解决符合随军条件的军官配偶（含离退休军官和文职干部的配偶）工作调动和易地安置问题提出５条具体意见。
