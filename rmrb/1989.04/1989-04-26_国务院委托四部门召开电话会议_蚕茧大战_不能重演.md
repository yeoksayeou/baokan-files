Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 26th.

The State Council entrusted four ministries to hold a telephone conference to deploy this year's silkworm cocoon procurement work, further implementing the "Emergency Notice from the State Council on the Unified Management of Silk Cocoon and Silk Procurement and Export" and the "Supplementary Notice" issued on April 25th, to prevent the recurrence of the "Silkworm Cocoon War."

Minister He Qinlian of the State Council represented the State Council in delivering a speech at the meeting. He said that the spring silkworm production this year is very good, and farmers in various places are very enthusiastic about raising silkworms. Silkworm cocoon production is likely to be another good year. However, the procurement situation in various places is very severe, and there is still the possibility of a "Silkworm Cocoon War." Therefore, he emphasized:

First, all localities must implement the State Council's regulations, with the China Silk Import and Export Corporation and its provincial (municipal, autonomous region) branch companies responsible for the unified management of silkworm cocoon, silk, and raw silk procurement and export. No other non-entrusted units, departments, or individuals are allowed to interfere. Farmers should be mobilized to sell fresh cocoons to the state and not to dry them themselves. Factories are not allowed to sell raw silk and raw silk fabrics. In key silkworm cocoon production areas, provincial governments can organize relevant departments to establish silk cocoon and silk coordination groups to lead, coordinate, and supervise the procurement work of cocoons, silk, and silk fabrics.

Second, strictly implement the state's price policies. The prices of silkworm cocoons and factory silk are determined by the state, and local prices must not be violated. No additional subsidies or surcharges are allowed under any name.

Third, it is necessary to control the current over-expansion of the silk production scale. Localities are not allowed to expand production capacity or start new projects. Ongoing expansion and new construction projects should be immediately halted. Factories that consume a lot, have poor quality, and low efficiency should be closed, stopped, merged, or transformed.

Fourth, provincial, municipal, and autonomous regional governments must consider the overall situation and take responsibility at all levels. Especially the leaders of the production areas, who are on the front line of stopping the "Silkworm Cocoon War," must implement the State Council's regulations item by item and ensure that orders are carried out.

The State Council has dispatched a joint working group consisting of the Supervision Department, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, the State Price Bureau, and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce to conduct inspections in various places during the spring cocoon procurement period.

　　国务院委托四部门召开电话会议    
    “蚕茧大战”不能重演
    本报北京４月２６日讯  记者梅洪如报道：受国务院委托，经贸部、监察部、国家物价局、国家工商局今天联合召开电话会议，部署今年蚕茧收购工作，进一步贯彻《国务院关于茧丝收购和出口全部实行统一经营管理的紧急通知》及今年４月２５日《补充通知》，防止再度发生“蚕茧大战”。
    国务院副秘书长何椿霖代表国务院在会上讲话。他说，今年春蚕生产形势很好，各地农民养蚕积极性很高，蚕茧生产很可能又是一个好年景。但各地收购形势很严峻，“蚕茧大战”仍有发生的可能。为此，他强调：
    一、各地一定要执行国务院规定，由中国丝绸进出口总公司及其省（市、区）分公司统一经营管理蚕茧、丝类、坯绸的收购和出口，其他非受委托的任何单位、部门或个人一律不得插手。要动员农民把鲜茧交售给国家，不自行烘茧。工厂不得自销生丝、坯绸。蚕茧重点产区，可由省政府组织有关部门成立茧丝绸协调小组，领导、协调、监督茧、丝、绸收购工作。
    二、严格执行国家的价格政策。蚕茧和厂丝价格由国家确定，各地不得违反，不得以任何名义搞价外补贴或价外加价。
    三、必须控制目前过大的丝绸生产规模。各地不能再扩大生产能力，上新项目。正在扩建、新建的项目应立即下马。对消耗大、质量差、效益低的工厂要关、停、并、转。
    四、省、市、自治区各级政府，要顾全大局，层层负责。特别是产地县的领导，处于制止“蚕茧大战”的第一线，必须逐条落实国务院的规定，做到令行禁止。
    国务院已指派监察部、经贸部、国家物价局、国家工商局组成联合工作组，在春茧收购期间分赴各地巡回检查。
