	Stamp Tax

	Q: What is stamp tax? How do taxpayers pay it?

	A: Stamp tax is a tax levied on documents, vouchers, and certificates related to economic activities and property transfers. The taxable items include various economic contracts, business ledgers, property transfer documents, and permits. The tax is paid by the person who creates, uses, or receives these documents.

	Stamp tax was first introduced in 1624 in the Netherlands. Currently, most countries and regions around the world impose stamp tax. In some places, stamp tax revenue constitutes a significant portion of total tax revenue. For example, in Hong Kong, stamp tax revenue ranks fourth among all tax revenues.

	As early as October 1912, the Beiyang government in China first levied stamp tax. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the State Council issued the "Interim Regulations on Stamp Tax" on December 19, 1950, beginning the nationwide collection of stamp tax. In 1952, 329 million yuan was collected. In September 1958, stamp tax was merged with commodity circulation tax, commodity tax, and business tax into a unified industrial and commercial tax. On October 1, 1988, China resumed the collection of stamp tax. The new stamp tax has 13 tax items, using both proportional and fixed tax rates.

	Taxpayers are responsible for self-assessing and paying the stamp tax. They calculate the tax payable based on the tax items and rates, purchase the appropriate stamp tax tickets, and affix them to the documents. Currently, there are nine types of stamp tax tickets, with denominations of 1 jiao, 2 jiao, 5 jiao, 1 yuan, 2 yuan, 5 yuan, 10 yuan, 50 yuan, and 100 yuan.

　　印花税
    问：什么叫印花税？纳税人怎样完税？
    答：印花税是对从事经济活动、产权转让等行为书立、使用、领受的凭证所征收的税种。其征税对象是各类经济合同、营业账薄、产权转移书据、权利许可证照等。由书立、使用、领受人交纳。
    印花税于１６２４年首创于荷兰。目前世界上绝大多数国家和地区都征收印花税。有的国家和地区印花税的收入占相当比重。如香港地区印花税收入在各税种收入中居第四位。
    早在１９１２年１０月，我国北洋军阀政府就首次开征印花税。新中国成立后，政务院于１９５０年１２月１９日公布《印花税暂行条例》，开始在全国范围征收印花税，１９５２年曾征收３．２９亿元。１９５８年９月，印花税与商品流通税、货物税、营业税合并为工商统一税。１９８８年１０月１日，我国又恢复征收印花税。新印花税共分１３个税目，采用比例、定额两种税率。
    印花税由纳税人自行完税。根据税目、税率表自己计算应纳税额，购买并一次贴足印花税票。目前的印花税票共有９种，面额分别为１角、２角、５角、１元、２元、５元、１０元、５０元、１００元。
