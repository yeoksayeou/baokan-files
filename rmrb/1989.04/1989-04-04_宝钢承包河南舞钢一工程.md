Shanghai Baosteel Group Co., Ltd. has signed a contract to undertake the "9100 slab continuous casting project" for Henan Wugang Steel Company. The signing ceremony was held recently in Beijing.

This major technological equipment project will be based on the introduction of Baosteel's advanced continuous casting technology. Through digestion and absorption, it will be entirely completed by domestic technical forces.

This new type of contracting model breaks down departmental boundaries, making it easier to absorb the advantages of the user departments in terms of processes and other aspects. It also closely integrates the advantages of design and manufacturing to provide systematic and comprehensive services.
