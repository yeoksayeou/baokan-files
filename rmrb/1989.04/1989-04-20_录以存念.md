	In Memory
		Ling Kang

	Regarding differing opinions on theoretical and academic issues, whether one should adopt a more tolerant attitude has long been a subject of debate. Some people think it is only natural, while others believe that tolerance is a tenet of "liberalism." The late historian Li Huo once wrote a preface for one of my small books, in which he also discussed his views on this matter. His perspective transcends the aforementioned two viewpoints and can be considered a unique insight. I have transcribed it below:

		"The prosperity of academia is inseparable from political democracy. Currently, people seem to still be apprehensive, fearing criticism, and avoid speaking of democracy, instead using terms like 'relaxation' and 'tolerance.' In reality, this is debatable. 'Relaxation' is in contrast to 'tightening.' Tying a person up is bad, but one must let them live for a while, temporarily 'relax' them, this is a momentary act of mercy, not a democratic system. 'Tolerance' in Europe is in reference to heretics. Heretics are not tolerated by authoritarian rulers, but often prove to be correct. Thus, people consider 'tolerance' a virtue. However, virtue cannot replace institutions, and it often varies from person to person, providing no guarantee. What people need now is to establish the democratic rights of the people as stipulated in the constitution as an institution, not personal benevolence."

	My small book, due to certain reasons, was never published, and thus the preface was also set aside. Now that the sage has passed, but his words should not be forgotten, hence I have transcribed them in memory.

　　录以存念
    凌亢
    对于理论学术问题上的不同意见，是否应采取宽容一些的态度，历来有争议。有人认为理所应当，有人认为宽容乃“自由党”的主张。已故历史学家黎澍曾为我的一本小书作序，其中也提到他对这个问题的见解。这见解超越上述两种意见，可谓一家之言。兹抄录于下：
    “学术的繁荣与政治民主有不可分的关系。现在人们仿佛还是心有余悸，怕遭非议，讳言民主，改叫‘宽松’、‘宽容’等等。其实值得商榷。‘宽松’是同捆紧相对而言的。把人捆死了，不好，还得让他活几时，暂且‘宽松’一下，这是一时的留情，不是民主制度。‘宽容’在欧洲是对异端而言的。异端为专制主义的统治者所不容，但事实常常证明它是正确的。于是人皆以‘宽容’为美德。但美德不能代替制度，而且也往往因人而异，是无保障的。现在人们需要的是把载在宪法上的人民民主权利规定为制度，不是个人的仁慈。”
    我的小书因故未曾出版，这序也就搁下了。今哲人已逝，但其言不可没，故特抄录以存念。
