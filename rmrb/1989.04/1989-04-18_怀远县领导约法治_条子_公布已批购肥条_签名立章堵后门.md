Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, April 18th.

On April 12th in the afternoon, the party and government leaders of Huaiyuan County, Anhui Province, publicly displayed over 500 "tickets" issued by various leaders for the purchase of fertilizer since last autumn. They also signed a three-point agreement to stop the practice of issuing "tickets" for personal favors or connections, effectively blocking the backdoor.

At the "ticket" display meeting, attended by over 1,000 county-level and above officials, County Committee Secretary Pan Chenguo said: "By publicly displaying these 500-plus fertilizer purchase 'tickets,' we aim to show the county leadership's resolve to combat the 'ticket' culture." Pan Chenguo read out a pre-prepared three-point agreement: After this meeting, if anyone issues another fertilizer purchase ticket, the following penalties will apply: first, the content of the ticket will be broadcast on the county radio station; second, the issuer's monthly salary and bonuses will be deducted; third, the issuer will face disciplinary action from the organization. He and County Magistrate Zhang Lianhua were the first to sign the agreement, followed by other leaders from the County Committee, County Government, and the County People's Congress Standing Committee.

The over 500 "tickets" displayed at the meeting authorized the purchase of more than 10,000 tons of "favor fertilizer," most of which went to office workers. Farmers expressed strong dissatisfaction with this practice.

The leaders' three-point agreement has caused a stir throughout the county. In recent days, nearly a thousand leaders from relevant county departments and townships have also signed responsibility statements, pledging not to issue or purchase "ticket fertilizer." Farmers who heard about this have all expressed their approval.

　　怀远县领导约法治“条子”
　　公布已批购肥条
　　签名立章堵后门
    新华社合肥４月１８日电　（通讯员姚和、记者沈祖润）４月１２日下午，安徽省怀远县党政领导成员，当着全县１０００多名乡以上干部的面，让去年秋天以来各位领导批的５００多张购肥“条子”亮相，并当场在不批“人情肥”、“关系肥”、杜绝“开后门”的约法三章上签名。
    县委书记潘成国在这次“条子”亮相会上说：让这５００多张购化肥的“后门条子”当众亮相，是为了显示县领导机关反“条子风”的决心。潘成国宣读了事先拟好的约法三章：这次会后，如再批一张购肥条子，一是到县广播站公开广播条子内容，二是扣除当月的工资、奖金，三是接受组织上的纪律处分。他和县长张连华带头在上面签上自己的名字，接着县委、县政府其他领导成员和县人大常委会的领导也一个接一个签名。
    这次会上亮相的５００多张“条子”，共批出“人情肥”１万多吨，得到“条子肥”的大多是机关工作人员，农民对此强烈不满。
    县领导者们约法三章，在全县引起震动，连日来，近千名县有关部门和区、乡领导干部也纷纷立下责任状，保证不批、不买“条子肥”。闻知这事的农民都连连称好。
