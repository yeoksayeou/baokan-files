A few years ago, a military writer vividly compared the army's simple and rigid ideological and political work to a "straight line plus square." Today, when the topic of ideological and political work comes up, many cadres still shake their heads and sigh, "Today's soldiers are hard to manage, and it's difficult to do ideological work with them!" Recently, the reporter conducted interviews in some companies in Suzhou, and what was seen and heard tells us: breaking free from the "straight line plus square" model is an old problem that the army's ideological and political work urgently needs to address in the new situation.

Walls and Prohibitions Fail—
Reflection One: The practice of closing doors and building barriers in ideological and political work has lost its effectiveness.

A certain company is stationed near a cotton mill with over 200 young female workers. During their free time, many soldiers voluntarily go to "connect" with them. The company's leaders panicked, leading the entire company to build a wall around the camp and issuing a clear regulation: anyone who crosses the line will be punished. However, the wall and the prohibition did not seal the soldiers' hearts. The song "Love's Eternal Flame" was sung more and more widely, and violations continued to occur.

Among the soldiers, there are those who ask, "Now, many enterprises are joint ventures with foreign countries, and many Chinese people are marrying foreigners. Why can't soldiers have a chance to meet someone from afar?" Facing such a reality, issuing a few "not allowed" rules and building a wall may seem decisive and firm on the surface, but in reality, it avoids the conflict and does not address the soldiers' actual thoughts, failing to solve the problem fundamentally. On the contrary, only by allowing them to widely interact with society and using social forces to guide them can we achieve results.

The practice of the Eighth Company stationed on Gulangyu Island in Xiamen illustrates this problem. A few years ago, when the country first opened up, people of various skin colors flowed towards Gulangyu Island, and the company's leaders worried that the soldiers might have problems, so they issued several "not allowed" regulations, even patrolling the streets and pushing people back. The result was that for every one person brought back, three went out. Later, the party branch, based on the soldiers' thoughts, reformed the ideological and political work, turning resistance into compliance and blockage into guidance. The soldiers were curious and mysterious about the seaside beach and wanted to find out, so the company organized swimming there. The soldiers were interested in dancing, so the company invited teachers from local departments to teach, and then organized activities with local youth... The soldiers' curiosity was satisfied, and their interests broadened. Because the military camp life was rich and colorful, the soldiers in the Eighth Company were stable in their thoughts, and there have been no violations in recent years.

"Visit home for a month, return to cause trouble."—
Reflection Two: The practice of ideological and political work being detached from reality and not daring to face reality urgently needs to change.

"Visit home for a month, return to cause trouble." This is a popular saying in the military camp. It means that cadres and soldiers receive education in the army and serve diligently, but after visiting their hometowns, walking around, and returning after a month, their thoughts go astray, causing trouble about demobilization and transfer. A certain unit once surveyed 61 people who had visited their homes, and the result was that 37 people did not serve diligently after returning, accounting for 60.7%.

The ideological and political work at the grassroots level cannot withstand the impact of "visiting home for a month," showing such fragility. What is the reason? The practice of ideological and political work being detached from reality and not daring to face the situation can be said to be the main reason.

Due to the influence of the traditional ideological and political work model, the army's approach to this work is often to emphasize the "great situation," "great achievements," and "superiority." Some political instructors, whether giving political education classes or talking to soldiers, rarely touch on the hot issues in real life. Many soldiers are very concerned about party discipline, prices, and unfair distribution, but their questions and confusions usually do not get timely and convincing answers. Additionally, there is a method of doing ideological and political work that emphasizes the beauty of enlightenment and the goodness of teaching, but neglects the truth of revelation. The result is that it sounds moving and inspiring, but when faced with the chaotic reality of society, it becomes weak and powerless. A soldier said, "The political instructor talks about how good the place is for soldiers, but when I go home, I can't even get the basic preferential treatment, it's better to retire early and go home to make money."

Tell the truth, speak the facts, and improve the soldiers' psychological endurance. This is an urgent task for improving the army's ideological and political work.

Three Applications for Party Membership Should Not Be Declared Invalid—
Reflection Three: Ideological and political work should abandon the old formula of "ideological problems equal political problems." In normal social life, most of a person's thoughts are non-political.

In a certain unit's Second Company, three soldiers who had completed their service period filled out party membership application forms and then received letters from home. One soldier's father took over a breeding farm and needed more labor; the other two soldiers' families had economic disputes with the units that signed contracts with them. The letters from home respectively requested them to retire. These three soldiers felt that they had completed their service period according to the Military Service Law, and their families had real difficulties, so they requested the company to retire at the end of the year. The soldiers' willingness to discuss their ideological problems with the organization should be seen as trust in the organization. Unfortunately, the company's leaders treated this as a political problem, saying that they were not politically firm, immature, and did not meet the conditions for being a Communist Party member, and declared their party membership application forms invalid.

Understanding people, respecting people, caring for people, and protecting people should become the new thinking of every ideological and political worker; changing the old thinking of always focusing on political stance is a new task facing every ideological and political worker.

### 从“直线加方块”的模式中走出——关于改进部队思想政治工作的思考

　　从“直线加方块”的模式中走出
    ——关于改进部队思想政治工作的思考
    几年前，一位部队作家曾把军队简单、生硬的思想政治工作形象地比喻为“直线加方块”。今天提起思想政治工作，许多干部仍会不由地摇头、叹气：“现在的兵真难带，战士的思想工作难做呀！”记者近日在苏南一些连队采访，所见所闻告诉我们：从“直线加方块”的模式中走出来，是部队思想政治工作在新形势下迫切需要解决的一个老问题。
    围墙加禁令失效——
    思考之一：思想政治工作关门筑垒、消极防范的做法失灵了。
    某连驻地有家麻纺厂，厂里有二百多青年女工。业余时间，不少战士主动登门与之“挂钩”。连队干部着了急，领着全连战士绕营区砌起一道围墙，并且明文规定：谁越雷池一步，就处分谁。但是，大墙、禁令都未能封住士兵的心，《爱情的烈火永不灭》这首歌越唱越广，违纪现象不断发生。
    战士中不乏这般发问者：“现在，许多企业都与国外联营，不少中国人同外国人联姻，当兵的为何不能有缘千里来相会？”针对这样的思想实际，规定几个“不准”，砌上一道围墙，表面上果断、坚决，实际上回避了矛盾，未能触及战士的思想实际，不能从根本上解决问题。相反，只有让他们广泛接触社会，借助社会力量，因势利导，才能收到成效。
    驻厦门鼓浪屿八连的实践说明了这个问题。几年前，国门初开，各种肤色的人流向鼓浪屿时，连队干部担心战士出问题，也曾规定了几“不准”，甚至上街纠察，往回撵人。结果，追回一个出去仨。后来，党支部根据战士思想特点，改革思想政治工作，变逆为顺，变堵为疏。战士对海滨浴场感到神秘好奇，想探个究竟，连队就组织去那里游泳，战士对跳舞有兴趣，连队就请地方部门的老师来教，然后有组织地与地方青年开展联谊……战士们的求知欲得到了满足，兴趣也广泛了。由于军营生活丰富、多彩，八连战士思想稳定，近年来没有发生过违纪现象。
    “探家个把月，回来闹转业。”——
    思考之二：思想政治工作脱离现实、不敢正视现实的状况亟待改变。
    “探家个把月，回来闹转业。”这是军营里流传的一则顺口溜。意思是说，干部、战士在部队接受教育，安心服役，可探亲回乡，走走看看，个把月归来，思想就离了谱，闹复员、闹转业。某单位曾对探过亲的六十一人进行调查，结果，三十七人归队后不安心服役，占百分之六十点七。
    基层思想政治工作经不起“探家个把月”的冲击，显得如此脆弱，原因何在？眼下思想政治工作脱离现实、不敢正视现状的做法，可以说是主要原因。
    由于受传统的思想政治工作模式的影响，部队抓这项工作的基调往往是讲“大好形势”、“巨大成就”和“优越性”。一些指导员无论是上政治教育课，还是找战士谈心，很少能触及现实生活中存在的热点问题。许多战士对党风、物价、分配不公等问题十分关心，然而，他们的疑问和困惑通常得不到及时、有说服力的解答。另外，有一种做思想政治工作的方法是偏重美的启迪和善的说教，但却忽略对真的揭示。结果是听起来动情，催人奋进，但一遇纷然杂陈的社会现实就变得软弱无力。一位战士说，指导员讲课说地方对当兵的怎么怎么好，可回家一看，连起码的优抚金都不能兑现，真不如早点退伍回家挣钱。
    讲真话，道实情，提高战士的心理承受力，这是改进部队思想政治工作的当务之急。
    三份入党志愿书该不该宣布作废——
    思考之三：思想政治工作要摒弃“思想问题等于政治问题”的旧公式，在正常的社会生活中，人的绝大部分思想属于非政治性的。
    某部二连有三名服役期满的战士填写入党志愿书后，先后接到家信。一个是战士的父亲承包了养殖场，劳力不够；另两个是战士的家庭与签订合同的单位闹经济纠纷。家里来信分别要求他们退伍。这三名战士觉得自己已按兵役法服役期满，家中有实际困难，便向连队提出年底退伍的要求。战士能把自己的思想问题主动谈出来，应当说是对组织的信任。遗憾的是，连队干部把这件事当政治问题来看，说他们政治上不坚定，不成熟，不符合共产党员条件，宣布他们的入党志愿书作废。
    理解人、尊重人、关心人、爱护人应成为每个思想政治工作者的新思路；改变动辄从政治立场着眼的旧思维，是摆在每个思想政治工作者面前的新课题。
