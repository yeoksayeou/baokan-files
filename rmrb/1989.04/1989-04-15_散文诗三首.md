	Three Prose Poems
	Kē Lán

	The Post Station
	Green Lake, with your tranquil waters and faint green hills. Today, you have become a small post station in my journey of life.

	It was the wind that held me back, the rain that detained me, or perhaps it was my heart, riding the winds and rains, that brought me to you. Is this a revisit, or do I have new confessions to make?

	Whether I am a weary wanderer or a lost traveler, you, the passionate Green Lake, have provided fodder for the horses and light for the lamps. Yet, you cannot tell me where my next post station in life will be.

		The Past
		In the midst of so many smiles and gazes of affection, all words of longing will fade with the wind, seeming powerless.

		Let everything be frozen in this moment of longing. As long as memory endures, longing will never fade.

		Do not ask about the winds that have blown over the mountains, do not ask about the streams that have flowed away, do not ask about the fleeting time, nor seek the vanished affections. As long as we have met, known, and loved each other, even death cannot erase this record of history.

		All that is sincere will have its place in the heart of history.

		Farewell
		At the time of farewell, the flowers' eyes are red with tears. The leaves stare with shocked eyes, and the ever-cheerful little grass bows its head. The rocks wear a stern and solemn expression, showing their inner sorrow and longing.

		Yet on the path of parting, people use empty blessings to comfort each other, and use hollow promises of joy to look forward to reunions. They also use empty noise to cover up the pain of separation.

		People, do you deceive even yourselves when you need to deceive?

　　散文诗三首
    柯蓝
    驿站
    绿色的翠湖呵，静静的湖水，淡淡的青山。你今天竟成了我人生逗留的一个小小驿站。
    是风留住了我，是雨留住了我，或者是我乘着心灵的风风雨雨的奔马，朝你而来。是重温，还是又有新的倾诉？
    不管是疲惫的流浪者，还是迷失路途的旅人。热情的翠湖呵，你为马匹增添了草料，你为车灯增添了光明。而你却不能告诉我，我人生下一个驿站，该在何处？
    　　　　过往
    在这么多依恋的微笑，依恋的眼光中，一切依恋的语言都会随风飘去，而显得无力。
    让一切定格在这依恋的一瞬，只要记忆不死，依恋就不会消亡。
    不必去追问吹过的山风，不必去追问流去的小河，不必去追问飞逝的时光，也不必去寻觅消失的情意，只要我们曾经相逢、相识、相亲，连死亡也泯灭不了这历史的记载。
    凡是属于真诚的，在历史的心灵的一角，都留有它有位置。
    　　　　告别
    在告别的时候，花儿的睛眶早哭红了。树叶也瞪着惊呆的目光，一直欢乐的小草也低下了头。岩石板着严肃深沉的面孔，以示它内心的悲痛和依恋。
    然而在分手的小路上，人们却用空幻的祝福，互相安慰，也用欢乐空泛的许诺，期待相逢。更用空洞的喧闹，来掩饰内心别离的痛苦。
    人呵，在需要欺骗的时候，连自己也欺骗吗？
