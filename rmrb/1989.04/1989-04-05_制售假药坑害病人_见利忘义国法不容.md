In November 1988, authorities in Siyang County of our city uncovered a group of lawbreakers manufacturing fake drugs. Some of these individuals dealt in raw materials, others were involved in production, some printed fake labels, others collected drug packaging, and a few specialized in wholesale distribution. A bottle of distilled water mixed with glucose powder was fraudulently sold as "Jiemicisin" injection solution, instantly increasing its price manifold. Relevant departments at the city and county levels investigated eight towns, including Jiaji, Geji, Zhongyang, Chengguan, and Lincai, and found a large quantity of fake drugs in five health clinics and eleven village health stations. They confiscated 13 types of drug-making tools and 11 types of raw materials. In Huaiyin and Siyang counties, some rural areas have become hotspots for the manufacture and sale of fake drugs, turning many households into drug-making workshops.

The harm that fake drugs inflict on public health is immeasurable. We appeal to relevant departments to seriously investigate and punish those involved in the manufacture and sale of fake drugs, preventing them from continuing to harm the people.

　　制售假药坑害病人  见利忘义国法不容
    １９８８年１１月，我市泗阳县查获一批制造假药的不法分子。他们中有的人经营原料，有的从事生产，有的印制假商标，有的回收药盒，有的专搞批发。一瓶蒸馏水加葡萄糖粉配制的溶液，竟变成了“洁霉素”注射液，顿时价格倍增。市县有关部门调查了八集、葛集、中扬、城厢、林柴场等乡的５个卫生院和１１个村卫生室，查出了大批假药，查收制药工具１３种，制药原料１１种。在淮阴、泗阳县的一些乡村，制售假药已成为一些不法分子发家致富的门路，许多农户家成了制药作坊。
    假药给人民健康带来的危害是不可低估的。呼吁有关部门严肃查处制售假药者，不能让他们继续坑害群众。
