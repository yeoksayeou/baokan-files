	Illegal marriages in Anhui are on the rise. According to statistics and surveys from more than 3,400 marriage registration offices in Anhui Province, illegal marriages accounted for 21.5% of the total number of registered and unregistered marriages in 1988. In counties like Feixi and Fengtai, this figure exceeded 50%, with some counties reaching as high as 70%.

	Among the nearly 90,000 couples who got married without proper registration, over 43,000 people were under the legal marriage age, making it an early marriage. Over 11,000 people were involved in arranged marriages or marriages between close relatives. Over 14,000 women from other provinces, such as Sichuan, entered Anhui through irregular channels and got married illegally. Additionally, over 50,000 couples, totaling more than 110,000 people, although they reached the legal marriage age, still followed the traditional "wedding ceremony" without completing the registration procedures.

	The Anhui Provincial Civil Affairs Department believes that the reasons for the large number of illegal marriages are complex. However, emphasizing and strengthening marriage registration work is an effective measure to reduce illegal marriages.

　　安徽违法婚姻增多
　  登记工作不可忽视
    本报讯　据安徽省３４００多个婚姻登记机关统计和普查，该省１９８８年违法婚姻占当年登记和非登记结婚总数的２１．５％，肥西、凤台等县超过５０％，有的县高达７０％。
    在实际结婚未登记的９万多对、１８万多人中，属于不到法定婚龄的早婚就有4．3万多人；属于换亲和近亲结婚的有１．１万多人；属于非正常流进、非法成婚的四川等外省妇女多达１．４万多人；属于虽到法定婚龄，仍按“拜堂”成婚不办登记手续的有５万多对、１１万多人。
    安徽省民政部门认为，出现大量违法婚姻原因复杂，但是，重视和加强婚姻登记工作，是减少违法婚姻的一个有效措施。（赵其阳）
