The "Savings Cup" football tournament, recently concluded in Foshan by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's Foshan branch, emphasized fair play and discipline, resulting in a well-ordered competition. This stood in stark contrast to the incidents involving Guizhou fans. Officials from the State Sports Commission who attended the event expressed their approval.

The four strong teams from Shanghai, Tianjin, Shandong, Guangdong, along with the Chinese Youth Team and the host team from Foshan, not only gained practical experience but also improved their moral standards. Relevant officials stated that future football tournaments should follow the example of the "Savings Cup" by emphasizing fair play.

    参加这次比赛的上海、天津、山东、广东４支劲旅和中国青年队、东道主佛山队既得到实战锻炼，又在思想上有提高。有关人士说，今后举行足球赛应像“储蓄杯”赛一样重视抓赛风。
