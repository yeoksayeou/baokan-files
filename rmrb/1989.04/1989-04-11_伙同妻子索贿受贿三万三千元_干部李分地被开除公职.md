Original synthetic fiber bureau official Li Fendi, taking advantage of his position and work opportunities, colluded with his wife Li Shirong to extort and accept bribes totaling 33,000 yuan. He was recently dismissed from public office.

Li Fendi, during his tenure at the planning department of the original synthetic fiber bureau of the Ministry of Textile Industry, was in charge of reviewing the establishment of construction projects for synthetic fiber factories and assisted in the arrangement of annual production plans. Since November 1986, Li Fendi, using methods such as writing letters and face-to-face discussions, successively extorted synthetic fiber from factories in Zhengzhou, Shaoyang, Baoding, and Dandong, totaling 27 tons, which he gave to township enterprises, and in the process, extorted and accepted bribes.

In the latter half of 1986, the Yuhang County Linping Dyeing Factory in Zhejiang Province sought Li Fendi's help for fiber. Li, at home, told the deputy factory director that he had already obtained fiber from the Shaoyang Synthetic Fiber Factory, and told him to take his wife to pick up the goods. He then took the opportunity to mention that his wife frequently traveled on business, incurring large expenses, and demanded a bribe from the visitor. After reaching an agreement, Li Shirong went to the Shaoyang Synthetic Fiber Factory and obtained 5 tons of synthetic fiber. After receiving the fiber, the dyeing factory sent someone to deliver 10,000 yuan to Li Fendi's home.

In June 1987, the secretary of the Linping Dyeing Factory came to Li Fendi's home and took the letters Li had written to the leaders of the Baoding and Dandong Synthetic Fiber Factories, falsely claiming that "the factory is a joint venture unit of the Labor Service Company of the Ministry of Textile Industry and is currently out of production due to lack of raw materials, and urgently requests assistance." The two synthetic fiber factories, according to Li Fendi's prior request in Beijing, provided 2 tons of synthetic fiber. Three months later, the secretary of the Linping Dyeing Factory personally delivered 3,000 yuan to Li Fendi.

In November 1987, Li Shirong, with Li Fendi's encouragement, carried a letter of introduction from the Labor Service Company of the Ministry of Textile Industry to the Xinxiang Synthetic Fiber Factory in Henan Province, and obtained another 3 tons of synthetic fiber for the Linping Dyeing Factory, extorting 14,000 yuan from the factory. In March 1988, Li Shirong went to the Shaoyang Synthetic Fiber Factory again to obtain 5 tons of fiber for the Linping Dyeing Factory, receiving 3,000 yuan in bribes.

Li Fendi and his wife's illegal activities were discovered by the Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Textile Industry based on public reports. During the investigation, Li Fendi and his wife were forced to hand over the bribes but then tried to cover up their serious problems by making various efforts.

　　伙同妻子索贿受贿三万三千元
　　干部李分地被开除公职
    新华社北京４月１０日电　原纺织工业部化纤局干部李分地利用职务和工作便利，伙同其妻李世荣索贿受贿３．３万元，近日被开除公职。
    李分地在纺织部原化纤局计划处工作期间，主管化纤厂基建项目的立项审查，协助年度生产计划的安排。１９８６年１１月以来，李分地利用写条子、当面谈的方式，先后向郑州、邵阳、保定和丹东等化纤厂索要化纤丝２７吨，给了乡镇企业，从中索贿受贿。
    １９８６年下半年，浙江省余杭县临平色织厂向李分地求援要丝。李在家中对该厂副厂长说，他已向邵阳化纤厂要丝，让他妻子一起去提货，并趁机借口他妻子经常出差，花销大，向来人索取贿赂。谈妥后，李世荣等到邵阳化纤厂要了５吨人造丝。色织厂拿到丝后，派人将１万元送到李分地家里。
    １９８７年６月，临平色织厂书记来到李分地家，取走李分地给保定、丹东两家化纤厂领导写的条子，假称“该厂是纺织部劳动服务公司的联营单位，目前因无原料已经停产，恳请给予帮助”。两个化纤厂根据李分地事先在京的要求，给了人造丝２吨。三个月后，临平色织厂书记亲自将３０００元送给李分地。
    １９８７年１１月，李世荣在李分地的纵容下，持纺织部劳动服务公司介绍信，到河南新乡化纤厂，为临平色织厂又要了３吨人造丝，并向该厂索贿１．４万元；１９８８年３月，李世荣又到邵阳化纤厂给临平色织厂再次要了５吨丝，收赃款３０００元。
    李分地夫妇的违法活动，是监察部驻纺织部监察局根据群众举报查出的。在调查中，李分地夫妇被迫交出赃款，但又四处活动，企图掩盖其严重问题。
