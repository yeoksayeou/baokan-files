Thai Foreign Minister Siti believes that military aid to Cambodian resistance forces can only stop after the Vietnamese withdrawal.

Our reporter Liu Aicheng reports from Bangkok on April 20: Thai Foreign Minister Siti pointed out yesterday in Bangkok that only after the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops can foreign military aid to Cambodian resistance forces be stopped.

Siti, the foreign minister, made the above remarks to reporters after returning to Bangkok from a visit to Singapore regarding the recent French military aid to the forces of Prince Sihanouk.

Siti, the foreign minister, added, "If Vietnam completely withdraws its troops from Cambodia, we agree to stop military aid to the Cambodian resistance forces. However, the Vietnamese troops have not yet withdrawn, and no one can tell me when or how they will withdraw."
