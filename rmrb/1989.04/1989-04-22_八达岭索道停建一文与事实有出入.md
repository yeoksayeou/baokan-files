Regarding the construction of the cable car at the Badaling section of the Great Wall, we have consistently held differing opinions based on our considerations for protecting world cultural heritage, national scenic areas, and national-level cultural relics. On March 2, we wrote a letter to Comrade Chen Xitong, hoping to have a dialogue with the mayor regarding this matter.

Mayor Chen Xitong took the time amidst his busy schedule to invite Luo Zhewen, Shan Shiyuan, Zheng Xiaoxie, Xie Ninggao, and relevant department and project management officials to discuss the Badaling cable car issue on March 8. Vice Mayors Zhang Baifu and He Luli, and Mayor's Assistant Huang Jicheng, participated in the discussion.

During the meeting, we presented our views on the necessity of halting the cable car construction from the perspectives of its impact on the scenic beauty of the Great Wall and its non-compliance with relevant national laws, and requested the mayor to consider these points.

Mayor Chen Xitong stated at the meeting: The four experts' dedication to cultural relic protection is commendable. We will convey this to the relevant departments and ask them to give it serious consideration. This contract was signed between the Badaling Cable Car Company and the Hong Kong Golden Light Company. Whether to halt construction is not decided by the municipal government but should be resolved through legal procedures by the two companies. Mayor Chen Xitong's respect for experts and his serious consideration of their opinions in a democratic manner deeply moved us.

On March 17, the second page of the People's Daily published an article by Xiaozhang titled "Beijing Mayor Accepts Experts' Advice, Halts Construction of Badaling Cable Car," which was also broadcast on the radio. The statement in this news item that "the Beijing Municipal Government has decided to halt the construction of the Badaling Great Wall cable car project" is inaccurate. As the parties involved, we feel it necessary to provide supplementary and corrective information.

### 八达岭索道停建一文与事实有出入

　　八达岭索道停建一文与事实有出入
    对于八达岭长城修建缆车索道问题，我们出于保护世界文化遗产、国家风景名胜区、国家级文物保护单位的考虑，一直有不同意见。３月２日，我们给陈希同同志写信，希望和市长就这个问题对话。
    陈希同市长在百忙中抽出时间，于３月８日邀请罗哲文、单士元、郑孝燮、谢凝高和有关部门及筹建单位负责同志，就八达岭索道问题进行了座谈对话。张百发、何鲁丽副市长，黄纪诚市长助理参加了座谈。
    会上，我们从这一索道破坏长城景观、不符合国家有关法律规定等方面，陈述了停建索道的必要性，请市长考虑。
    陈希同市长在会上说：４位专家热心文物保护的精神是可贵的，我们将转告有关部门，请他们认真考虑。这项合同是八达岭索道公司和香港金辉公司签订的，是否停建不由市政府决定，应由两家公司按照法律程序协商解决。陈希同市长尊重专家，认真听取意见的民主作风，使我们很受感动。
    ３月１７日《人民日报》二版发表晓章写的《北京市长接受专家意见，八达岭索道停建》，电台也作了广播。这则消息中所称“北京市政府决定停建八达岭长城索道工程”一说与事实有出入，我们是当事者，有必要予以补充和更正。
