A seasoned and loyal Communist warrior, a great proletarian revolutionary and statesman, an outstanding political worker of our army, and an excellent leader who has long held important leadership positions in the Party, Comrade Hu Yaobang has passed away. In his 60 years of revolutionary career, he worked diligently and unceasingly, dedicating his entire life to the cause of liberation and socialist construction for the Chinese people, and establishing immortal achievements. His historical merits and excellent qualities will be recorded in history.

Comrade Hu Yaobang was born on November 20, 1915, in a poor peasant family in Liuyang County, Hunan Province. From a young age, he cared about the future and destiny of the country, studied diligently, and excelled in his studies. Under the influence of the Autumn Harvest Uprising, he joined the tide of the land revolution. In the winter of 1929, he secretly joined the Communist Youth League in his hometown. In May 1930, the Central Red Army liberated Liuyang County, and Hu Yaobang, who was then studying in a county middle school, was sent by the Party to return to his hometown to serve as the secretary of the township branch and a member of the district committee. Soon, he was transferred to the Special Committee of the Communist Youth League in Xiangdongnan to serve as the technical secretary. In May 1932, he was transferred to the Hunan-Jiangxi Provincial Committee to work on children's affairs. In January 1933, he went to Ruijin and was dispatched by the Central Bureau of the Communist Youth League to inspect work in Ninghua County and Qingliu County in Fujian Province. In May, he worked in the Children's Bureau of the Central Soviet Area, and in August, he served as the director of the propaganda department and the youth department of the Anti-Imperialist Pro-Soviet Alliance. In September, he became a member of the Communist Party. After joining the Party, he was transferred to the Central Bureau of the Communist Youth League to serve as the secretary-general. Comrade Hu Yaobang studied Marxism-Leninism seriously during his work in the Soviet Area, underwent tempering and testing, established a firm communist belief, and did a lot of work for the construction of the Communist Youth League in the Central Soviet Area.

In October 1934, Comrade Hu Yaobang began the Long March with the Central Red Army, which shocked the world. Despite suffering from serious illness and being injured by enemy aircraft, he maintained a firm revolutionary will. He worked on mass movements and youth affairs in the Political Department of the Third Army Corps. After arriving in Shaanbei, he served as the secretary-general of the Central Bureau of the Communist Youth League. In January 1936, he participated in the Eastward Expedition of the Red Army. In June, he served as the deputy director and director of the Organization Department and the director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Bureau of the Communist Youth League, making achievements in youth work in the Shaanbei revolutionary base area.

In May 1937, Comrade Hu Yaobang went to Yan'an to study at the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University and successively served as the deputy director of the Political Department and the political commissar of the First Brigade of Wayaogou. In 1939, he served as the deputy director and director of the Organization Department of the General Political Department of the Central Military Commission, and in extremely difficult conditions, he persisted in the war of resistance and made important contributions to strengthening the political and organizational construction of our army.

After the victory of the War of Resistance, in January 1946, Comrade Hu Yaobang went to work in the Jireliao Military Region and served as the acting director of the Political Department. In July, he served as the political commissar of the Fourth Column of Jinchaoji. In August 1947, he served as the political commissar of the Third Column of Jinchaoji. He led the battles of Datong, Zhangjiakou, and Shijiazhuang. In August 1948, he served as the director of the Political Department of the Eighteenth Army Corps and participated in leading the battles of Taiyuan and Baoji. In the winter of 1949, he led his troops to participate in the march to liberate the southwest. In the decisive battle with the Kuomintang reactionaries, he insisted on arming the broad masses of soldiers and officers with Mao Zedong's strategic thought, strengthening the ideological construction of the troops, and giving full play to the great power of the political work of our army, fighting bravely, and playing an important role in winning the victory of the War of Liberation.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Hu Yaobang served as the secretary of the CPC Chuanbei Area Committee, the head of the administrative office, and the political commissar of the military region. He led the people of Chuanbei to carry out land reform, suppress bandits and local tyrants, stabilize social order, and quickly restore and develop industrial and agricultural production. After 1952, he served as the secretary and first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. During his tenure at the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, he educated the broad masses of league members and young people with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, carried out rich and colorful activities according to the characteristics of young people, advocated a style of "vigor and realism," united the broad masses of league members and young people around the Party, actively participated in socialist construction, and made the work of the league develop greatly, fully playing the role of the Party's assistant. In 1962, he was sent down with his job to serve as the secretary of the CPC Hunan Provincial Committee and the first secretary of the Xiangtan District Committee. At the end of 1964, he served as the first secretary of the CPC Shaanxi Provincial Committee and the second secretary of the Central Northwest Bureau. He went deep into reality, conducted investigations and research, shared weal and woe with the broad masses of cadres and the people, and strove to develop industrial and agricultural production, promoting the socialist construction of the region.

After the start of the "Cultural Revolution" in 1966, the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counter-revolutionary clique, in order to seize power, completely negated the work of the league, fabricated charges, and brutally suppressed and persecuted Comrade Hu Yaobang. He paid no heed to personal honor and danger and fought unremittingly against the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counter-revolutionary clique. In 1975, when he was in charge of the leadership of the Party organization of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, he seriously implemented the policy of comprehensive rectification, drafted the outline of the report on "Several Problems in Scientific and Technological Work," correctly reflected the actual situation of the scientific and technological front, and was once again subjected to erroneous criticism in the so-called "counterattack against the rightist reversal of verdicts."

During this period, he organized and promoted the discussion on the criterion of truth, making theoretical preparations for the Party to re-establish its Marxist ideological line. He insisted on the principles of seeking truth from facts and correcting mistakes, proposing that all false words, all incorrect conclusions and handling, regardless of when, where, and how they were made, regardless of which level and who approved them, should be corrected. He resolutely organized and led the work of rectifying wrong cases and implementing policies for cadres, enabling a large number of old revolutionaries, cadres, intellectuals, and the people who had suffered injustice and persecution to be rectified and restored their reputation, showing extraordinary revolutionary courage and bravery, and establishing immortal merits. He attached importance to theoretical propaganda work, further clarifying the guiding ideology of theoretical propaganda work in the new period, which is the combination of Marxism and the modernization of Chinese socialism. In order to fully restore and carry forward the Party's fine traditions and style, maintain the Party's centralized and unified leadership, strictly enforce Party discipline, and improve the Party's fighting capacity, he presided over the formulation of the "Several Provisions on Party Political Life."

In February 1980, at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, he was elected as a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and the general secretary of the Central Committee. In June 1981, at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, he was elected as the chairman of the Central Committee. In September 1982, at the Twelfth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, he reported on behalf of the Central Committee on "Comprehensively Opening Up a New Situation in the Construction of Socialist Modernization." At the First Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee, he was elected as a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, a member of the Standing Committee, and the general secretary of the Central Committee. In October 1983, he concurrently served as the director of the Central Commission for Party Rectification. After Comrade Hu Yaobang took up the main leadership positions of the Party, he made significant contributions in many aspects to adhere to the line since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, adhere to the four cardinal principles, adhere to reform and opening up, and build socialism with Chinese characteristics.

He attached importance to and promoted the reform of the economic system with cities as the center, participated in the formulation of the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Economic System Reform." He attached importance to and promoted the opening up of coastal areas and the development of socialist commodity economy. He paid great attention to the construction of border and impoverished areas, personally visiting many such areas.

Comrade Hu Yaobang respected knowledge and talents, attached importance to the Party's scientific work, educational work, literary and artistic work, and news work, and paid attention to giving full play to the important role of intellectuals in the Four Modernizations. In his speech to young intellectuals on their growth path, he enthusiastically encouraged young intellectuals to go to the grassroots, to the masses, and to the practice of the Four Modernizations, to temper themselves and grow healthily. He successively presided over the formulation of the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Reform of the Educational System" and the "Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Guiding Principles for the Construction of Socialist Spiritual Civilization." He insisted on the "Four Modernizations" policy for the cadre team and vigorously promoted the reform of the cadre system.

Comrade Hu Yaobang made unremitting efforts to strengthen the Party's self-construction and improve and strengthen the Party's leadership. At the 100th anniversary of Marx's death, he delivered a speech titled "The Great Truth of Marxism Illuminates Our Way Forward," inspiring the broad masses of Party members and cadres to better master Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. He presided over the formulation of the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Party Rectification." He called on leading cadres at all levels to set an example in observing Party discipline and style, and the central organs should set an example for the whole country.

Comrade Hu Yaobang always paid attention to the Party's united front work, ethnic work, and religious work, and devoted his heart to strengthening the cooperation between our Party and various democratic parties and non-partisan patriotic democrats, establishing a relationship of mutual trust and sharing weal and woe.

Comrade Hu Yaobang visited many countries and often received foreign state leaders and party leaders on visits, making efforts to restore and develop the relationship between our Party and other countries' communist parties, workers' parties, and to develop the relationship between our Party and foreign social democratic parties, nationalist parties, and other parties, to increase mutual understanding and friendship between the Chinese people and the governments and peoples of various countries, and to make important adjustments to our country's foreign policy in the new period.

He was also a representative of the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China, a member of the Eighth, Eleventh, Twelfth, and Thirteenth Central Committees, and a member of the Standing Committee of the First, Second, and Fifth National People's Congress.

Comrade Hu Yaobang, as a Marxist, had a brilliant life. He dedicated his entire life to the great cause of the Party and the people. Whether in the revolutionary war years or in the peaceful construction period, he always unswervingly studied and researched Marxism seriously, devoted himself to the combination of Marxist basic principles with the reality of our revolution and construction. He considered the overall situation, acted according to Party principles, and resolutely safeguarded the interests of the Party and the people. He maintained close ties with the masses, had an open mind, democratic style, did not hide his political views, dared to insist on the truth, and was brave in self-criticism.
