    How to prioritize the treatment of water pollution? Chinese experts, through comprehensive investigations and research, have proposed a "blacklist" of pollutants that need to be prioritized for treatment and controlled in China's water environment.

    Among the 12 most prominent categories of 48 pollutants that experts have identified for priority treatment, all possess carcinogenic, teratogenic, and mutagenic toxicities. For example, halogenated hydrocarbons and benzene compounds can cause chromosomal changes, leading to abnormal development of muscles and the gastrointestinal system, and induce leukemia. Phenols, chlorinated benzenes, nitrobenzenes, and other compounds can cause cellular mutations, fetal poisoning, and skin cancer. Additionally, there are many highly toxic pesticides such as DDT, BHC, parathion, and others, as well as cyanides, heavy metals, and their compounds.

    These priority water pollutants for environmental treatment were selected from an initial list of 2,347 pollutants, based on the principle of prioritizing the severity and urgency of their harmful effects in China.

　　水污染物“黑名单”排出    
    专家建议优先治理
    据新华社北京４月２７日电（实习生包安隽）治理水污染怎样区别轻重缓急？我国专家通过较为全面的调查和研究论证，提出了我国水环境优先治理和重点控制的污染物“黑名单”。
    在专家们提出的需要优先治理的污染物“黑名单”中，最突出的１２类４８种污染物都具有致癌、致畸形、致突变的毒性。如能造成姐妹染色体变化，导致肌肉、肠胃系统发育异常，诱发白血病的卤代烃类、苯类化合物；有导致细胞突变、胎儿中毒、皮肤癌的酚类、氯代苯类、硝基苯类化合物，还有许多用量大、毒害大的农药如六六六、滴滴涕、敌敌畏、乐果、除草醚、敌百虫以及氰化物、重金属及其化合物等。
    这些优先治理水环境污染物，是专家们从汇集到的２３４７种污染物的初始名单中，按照在我国危害程度轻重缓急的原则逐步筛选出来的。
