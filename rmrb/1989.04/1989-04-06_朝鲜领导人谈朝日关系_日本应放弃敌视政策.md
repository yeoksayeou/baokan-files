North Korean Leader on Japan-North Korea Relations: Japan Should Abandon Hostile Policies

	Peking, April 5 (Xinhua) - Xú Bǎokāng reports: A member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and Secretary, Hŏ Chŏng, spoke publicly on April 4 in Pyongyang regarding Japan-North Korea relations, stating that the Japanese government should not just stop at verbal improvements in Japan-North Korea relations, but should abandon its hostile policy towards North Korea. At the very least, it should take concrete actions to stop creating the "two Koreas."

	Hŏ Chŏng made these remarks at a banquet held in honor of the Japanese Socialist Party delegation. On the same day, Chairman Kim Il-sung met with the Japanese Socialist Party delegation led by Tanabe Seiichi and exchanged views on Japan-North Korea relations, but specific details were not reported.

	At the banquet, Tanabe Seiichi expressed the hope that Japan-North Korea relations could be adjusted anew, emphasizing that such relations should involve Japan's reflection on past history and assistance to North Korea in easing tensions on the Korean Peninsula and achieving Korean reunification. He believed that in the matter of normalizing Japan-North Korea relations, the Japanese government still has much to do.

　　朝鲜领导人谈朝日关系
    日本应放弃敌视政策
    本报平壤４月５日电  记者徐宝康报道：朝鲜劳动党中央政治局委员、书记许锬４日在平壤就朝日关系问题公开表态说，日本政府不要只把改善日朝关系停留在口头上，而应当放弃敌视朝鲜的政策，起码要拿出停止制造“两个朝鲜”的实际行动。
    许锬是在日本社会党代表团举行答谢宴会上讲这番话的。４日金日成主席会见了日本社会党田边成一行，并就朝日关系问题交换了意见，但没有报道具体细节。
    在当天的答谢宴会上，田边成希望，朝日关系能够得到新的调整，并强调，这种关系应当是，日本对过去历史的反省，以及在缓和朝鲜半岛紧张局势和实现朝鲜统一问题上对朝鲜的协助。他认为，在日朝关系正常化问题上，日本政府还有许多事情要做。
