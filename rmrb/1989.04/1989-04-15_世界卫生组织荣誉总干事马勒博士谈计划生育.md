The Honorary Director-General of the World Health Organization and Secretary-General of the International Planned Parenthood Federation, Halfdan Mahler, once again sounded the "population alarm" at a press conference held in London yesterday: "The bell that rings must be the one to unring it." The current global development and environmental crises need to be fundamentally resolved by controlling the rapid growth of the world's population.

Dr. Mahler believes that to achieve this, we must start with family planning. Statistics show that currently, only one-third of women of childbearing age worldwide practice family planning. With the increase in population, by the year 2000, there will be 950 million couples of childbearing age in the world. If family planning is not promoted in a timely manner, population growth will be like a runaway horse. Dr. Mahler believes that giving birth too early or too late, too many or too frequently, is harmful to the health of both infants and mothers. On the other hand, family planning has only benefits and no drawbacks. Reliable scientific evidence shows that family planning creates good conditions for eugenics, which can save approximately 5 million infants from dying during childbirth each year; prevent 500,000 women from dying from pregnancy-related diseases; and more importantly, family planning helps maintain the balance between natural resources and population, which is crucial for national development and resource protection. This balance is a necessary condition for humanity to achieve peace, prosperity, and happiness.

In fact, family planning is already a global trend. In the European region, although low birth rates are a characteristic of this region, with a total fertility rate of about two children, some countries have birth rates lower than the population replacement level; however, family planning services and information are widely accepted in most countries. Since 1987, relevant laws in some countries have changed, such as the legalization of sterilization in Turkey and Hungary, and the implementation of compulsory education in Poland. Some countries have high contraceptive rates, such as Belgium, Hungary, Austria, and Yugoslavia, which are 81%, 73%, 71%, and 55% respectively. In the Asian region, the proportion of couples practicing family planning through contraception is also high, such as Singapore, Japan, Malaysia, and the Philippines, which are 74%, 64%, 51%, and 31% respectively. In the Western Hemisphere of America, the contraceptive rate is also high, such as the United States, Trinidad and Tobago, Paraguay, and Ecuador, which are 68%, 52%, 36%, and 44% respectively. In Africa, the Arab region, and the Indian Ocean region, except for Mauritius, Egypt, and Sri Lanka, where the contraceptive rates are 75%, 30%, and 55% respectively, the rates in other countries are generally still quite low. However, overall, family planning is increasingly becoming a global reality.

Of course, controlling the world's population is still a long way off. Mr. Mahler sincerely hopes that the population alarm will continue to ring, paving the way for environmental and development efforts. The world's largest family planning organization he leads has the "Global Goal for the Year 2000," by which time the International Planned Parenthood Federation and its regional branches aim to achieve the goal of at least 450 million couples practicing family planning. More encouragingly, currently, United Nations agencies, governments of various countries, and some non-governmental organizations are working together to achieve this "Global Goal for the Year 2000."

　　世界卫生组织荣誉总干事马勒博士谈计划生育
    本报记者　陈特安
    世界卫生组织荣誉总干事、国际计划生育联合会秘书长哈夫丹·马勒昨天在伦敦举行的记者招待会上又一次敲响了“人口警钟”：解铃还需系铃人，目前世界发展与环境危机，需要从控制世界人口过速增长本身去求得根本解决。
    马勒博士认为，要做到这一点就得从计划生育入手。据统计，目前世界育龄妇女中只有１／３的人实行计划生育，随着人口的增加，到２０００年世界育龄夫妇将达９．５亿对。如不及时推广计划生育，人口膨胀将如脱缰之马。马勒博士认为，生育过早或过晚，过多或过密，对婴儿和母亲的健康都有害。而计划生育则有百利而无一害。有可靠科学证据表明，计划生育为优生优育创造良好条件，这可以使每年约５００万婴儿免于在分娩中丧生；使５０万名妇女免于因孕期疾病而死亡；更重要的是，计划生育有助于保持自然资源与人口之间的平衡，这个平衡对国家发展和资源保护具有重要意义，是人类赢得和平、繁荣和幸福的必要条件。
    其实，计划生育在目前世界上已是大势所趋。在欧洲地区，尽管低生育率是这个地区的特点，总和生育率大约为两个小孩子，有些国家的生育率还低于人口更替水平；但家庭计划生育的有关服务和信息在大部分国家还是被广泛接受。１９８７年以来，在某些国家有关法规已有变化，如绝育在土耳其、匈牙利已合法化，在波兰已实行义务性教育。一些国家的避孕率相当高，如比利时、匈牙利、奥地利、南斯拉夫分别达到８１％、７３％、７１％和５５％。在亚洲地区，采用避孕方式实行计划生育的比例也较高，如新加坡、日本、马来西亚、菲律宾分别达到７４％、６４％、５１％和３１％，在西半球的美洲地区，避孕率也较高，如美国、特立尼达和多巴哥、巴拉圭、厄瓜多尔等分别为６８％、５２％、３６％和４４％。在非洲、阿拉伯以及印度洋地区，除毛里求斯、埃及和斯里兰卡的避孕率分别达到７５％、３０％和５５％外，其它国家普遍都还比较低。但总的说，计划生育已越来越成为一种世界性的现实。
    当然，要控制世界人口，前面的路还很长。马勒先生深情地希望能让人口警钟长鸣，为环境与发展开道。他所领导的世界最大的计划生育组织已有“２０００年的全球目标”，届时国际计划生育联合会和地区，更令人欣慰的是，目前联合国机构、各国政府以及一些民间组织都在齐心协力，为至少使４．５亿对夫妇实行家庭计划生育这一“２０００年全球目标”而辛勤工作着。
