In Memory of a Great Man

    His natural talents were sharp, his studies arduous,
    His outstanding abilities surpassed all others.
    He bravely resisted the current, charging against the waves,
    Shouldering the weight of five mountains, forgetting himself.
    He was straightforward and honest, without deceit,
    His heart was open, his words sincere.
    Just as he was needed to support the great hall,
    It is painful to see him pass away, tears fill my robe!

　　悼伟人
    莫文骅
    天资聪敏学艰辛，卓绝才华冠群英。
    勇拒逆流冲恶浪，肩挑五岳自忘身。
    直率诚实无韬晦，胸怀豁达语贴心。
    正需鼎力撑大厦，痛君长逝泪盈衿！
    　　　　　１９８９年４月２０日
