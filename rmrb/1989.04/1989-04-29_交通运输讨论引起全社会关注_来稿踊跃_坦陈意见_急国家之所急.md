How to Quickly Change the Backward Situation of Transportation? Discussion on Transportation Issues

The discussion on transportation has sparked nationwide attention. Since March 9th, this newspaper started the discussion on transportation issues with the article "Railways Are Struggling and Crying Out." Various sectors of society have actively contributed articles, with over 400 submissions received so far. Many of these articles contain valuable insights and opinions, but due to space limitations, they could not all be published in full. Below is a summary of the main points.

Society Widely Participates in the Discussion on Transportation Issues

The backward development of railways, difficulties in buying tickets, riding, and transporting goods, affects every household and every industry. Participants in the discussion include railway departments, transportation departments, and other industries, as well as cadres, workers, and farmers. Leaders from central government departments, experts, and scholars from research institutions and universities have also contributed. Many comrades have emphasized that discussing transportation issues, especially railway issues, is crucial for understanding the strategic importance of transportation and finding solutions to its backwardness. Some contributions have also offered suggestions for the discussion. Chen Wen, a teacher from Huaihua No. 1 Middle School in Hunan, hopes that the newspaper will uphold the spirit of democracy, allowing everyone to speak the truth and express their opinions freely, which is essential for a successful discussion. Wang Shubao from Tuzhou Newspaper in Anhui suggests that the central government needs to make decisive decisions, as merely calling for development without concrete actions will not be effective.

Recognizing the Strategic Role of Railways in National Economic Development

Developing railways requires a correct understanding of their role in national economic development, placing them in a priority position. Otherwise, economic laws will impose penalties. This is a common viewpoint in the contributions. Yang Maozheng from the Industrial and Transportation Bureau of the National Bureau of Statistics believes that it is necessary to address fundamental cognitive issues, such as recognizing that the transportation sector, although not producing tangible goods, is a material guarantee for normal production. It is essential not to overlook the importance of transportation while focusing on product production. The necessity of railway development should be acknowledged. Chen Yuguang from the Party School of Chengdu Railway Bureau analyzes the severe consequences of railway backwardness on the entire national economy. Firstly, the shortage of transportation capacity leads to the accumulation of large amounts of materials, preventing the release of potential efficiency. Secondly, railway backwardness turns major arteries into short lines, constraining the short supply economy and causing severe distortions in supply-demand relationships. Poor transportation not only disrupts the commercial order but also distorts economic proportions and causes commodity prices to deviate from their value. Sun Qiyuan, a deputy professor from the same school, estimates that the untransported volume of railways accounts for more than 20% of the national total turnover. If industrial and agricultural production is stuck on the railways, it will be both labor-intensive and costly.

Why is Railway Development Severely Backward?

The severe backwardness of railway development is a historical issue and not a recent problem. The Institute of Transportation and Economic Research of the Railway Science Academy analyzes the main causes of the railway crisis: Firstly, long-term underinvestment in railways. The proportion of railway construction investment in national construction investment was around 10% from the First Five-Year Plan to the Fourth Five-Year Plan, but it dropped to 6.4% in the Fifth Five-Year Plan and further to 5.4% in 1986. Secondly, fiscal policies are not favorable for railway development. The state treats railways as a significant source of fiscal revenue, setting the lowest depreciation rates and the highest tax rates. By 1980, the railway depreciation rate was significantly lower than other industries, while the business tax rate was the highest among all industries until 1985. Additionally, China often requires railways to complete urgent emergency transportation tasks at prices lower than transportation costs, which objectively increases the burden on railways. Liu Yuehua from the Statistics Bureau of the Ministry of Railways analyzes that railway construction lacks a long-term plan that can be implemented. Often, planned railways are not built, while unplanned ones are hastily started, leading to decision-making errors and operational losses. Alternatively, construction does not follow procedures, leading to repeated design changes and rework, causing waste. For example, the construction of the Tong-Huo and Yi-Min lines has such issues. Additionally, the difficulties in land acquisition and demolition have delayed construction timelines and increased railway costs. Xu Jiaguang from the Policy Research Office of the Ministry of Railways believes that railway tension and poor management are also important factors. Macroeconomic control is out of balance, material flow is irrational, and railways often engage in detour, head-to-head, and reverse transportation, exacerbating railway transportation tension.

Suggestions for Railway Development

Many contributions express their views and suggestions on developing China's railways: 1. The state should decide early to increase investment in railways and implement preferential investment policies for a certain period. 2. Improve and strengthen the main transportation capacity and flexibility of the railway network, such as focusing on the development of coal transportation from Shanxi to the outside and the north-south trunk lines. 3. Adjust the tax rates and loan interest rates for railways. 4. Railway construction funds should be raised through multiple channels, relying solely on national financial investment is not enough. 5. Adjust the depreciation rate and quickly repay the railway's overdue accounts for updates and major repairs. Some contributions suggest that to develop railways, it is necessary to formulate a long-term and stable policy conducive to railway development. The state should have specialized institutions and personnel to formulate such long-term policies and plans based on the needs of national economic development. Additionally, some contributions have offered suggestions on railway diversion, the development of electrified railways, and railway investment methods.

There are many discussions in the contributions about price reforms. Since the adjustment of freight and ticket prices affects railways, various industries, and the interests of millions of passengers, whether to adjust prices and how to adjust them are hot topics. He Shiyuan from the Price Bureau of Hubei Province says that "one-time adjustment" may cause a significant initial shock but can stabilize for a longer period. "Gradual adjustment" may give the public the impression of frequent price increases, increasing psychological pressure. Some people think it should be done cautiously. Wang Fushan from Shouyu Copper Mine in Chengde says that adjusting railway freight prices involves the production costs of daily necessities such as grain, cotton, oil, salt, and production materials like steel and energy. It cannot be taken lightly. Peng Wei from the Coal Bureau of Luxi County in Hunan believes that railway freight prices should not be significantly increased in the short term, as a small increase can be more acceptable to the public.

专栏：如何尽快改变滞后局面？交通运输问题讨论

　　交通运输讨论引起全社会关注   
    来稿踊跃　坦陈意见　急国家之所急
    本报记者  王彦田
    如何尽快改变交通滞后局面？本报自３月９日以《铁路在拚搏中呼喊》一文开篇，展开交通运输问题讨论以来，社会各界纷纷来稿，到目前已收到稿件４００多篇，其中有许多好的看法和意见，因为版面有限未能成篇见报，现综述如下。
    社会各界关注交通运输问题讨论
    铁路发展滞后，买票难，乘车难，货运难，涉及到千家万户，关系到各行各业。来稿参加讨论的有铁路部门、交通部门和其它行业，有干部、工人、农民，中央主管部门的领导，研究机构和大专院校的专家、学者，许多同志谈到，就交通运输问题展开讨论，无疑对认识交通、尤其是铁路的战略地位，寻找解决滞后的对策，有重要作用。也有来稿对讨论提出建议。湖南怀化一中教师陈文在来稿中希望报纸发挥民主精神让大家讲真话，有啥说啥，这场讨论才能搞好。安徽涂州报社王书保认为，发展铁路，中央提过，专家学者建议过，这么多年过去了，铁路的悲歌不但没沉寂，反而越唱越高。中央不拿出果断决策，喊得再高也没用。
    认识铁路在发展国民经济中的战略地位
    发展铁路，首要的是正确认识铁路在发展国民经济中的地位，即把它放在优先地位，否则就会受到经济规律的惩罚。这是来稿中较一致的观点。国家统计局工交司杨茂桢认为，要从思想上解决一些基本认识问题，如运输部门虽然不生产有形的物质产品，但它却是使生产正常进行的物质保证，不能只重产品生产，而忽视交通的作用，要看到铁路超前发展的必要性；又如，不能把交通运输和一般企业等同看待，在政策上一刀切。成都铁路局党校陈雨光，从铁路严重滞后给整个国民经济带来严重后果，分析了铁路的地位和作用。其一，运力严重短缺，致使大量的物资滞运仓储，效能无法释放。其二，铁路滞后，大动脉成了大短线，大短线制约了短缺经济，以致供求关系严重扭曲。运输不畅，不仅打乱了商品经济秩序，破坏了经济比例关系，也使商品价格与价值背离。该校孙其远副教授估算，铁路欠运量达国家总周转量的２０％以上。工农业生产的东西在铁路上卡住了，不是劳民伤财吗？
    铁路发展严重滞后原因何在？
    铁路发展严重滞后，是历史形成的，并非始于今日。铁道科学研究院运输与经济研究所分析：形成铁路危机的主要原因：一是对铁路长期投资不足。铁路基建投资占全国基建投资比重，“一五”到“四五”在１０％左右，“五五”以后下降到６．４％，到１９８６年只有５．４％。二是财政政策不利于铁路发展。国家把铁路作为财政收入的一大来源，规定最低的折旧率和最高的税率，到１９８０年，铁路折旧率一直大大低于其它行业，而营业税率在１９８５年以前一直是各行业中最高的。此外，我国经常要求铁路以低于运输成本的价格优先完成一些紧急抢运任务，这在客观上也加重了铁路的负担。铁道部计统局刘悦华分析：铁路建设缺乏能够兑现的长远规划，往往是有规划的铁路没去建，没规划的又仓促上马，形成决策失误，运营后亏损；或不能按基建程序办，施工中反复变更设计，返工，造成浪费。如通霍和伊敏两条新线的建设就存在这类问题。另外，征地、拆迁难度越来越大，也拖延了建设工期和提高了铁路造价。铁道部政策研究室徐家全认为，铁路紧张，管理不善也是个重要因素，宏观控制失调，物资流向不合理，铁路迂回运输，相向运输，倒流运输，屡见不鲜，加剧了铁路运输紧张。
    为发展铁路献计献策
    许多来稿都陈述对发展我国铁路的看法和建议：１、国家应早下决心，增加对铁路的投入，在一定时期对铁路实行倾斜投资。２、改善和加强铁路主要方向运力和铁路网的机动性。如重点发展晋煤外运、南北大动脉等。３、调整铁路的税率和贷款利率。４、铁路筹集建设资金要多种渠道，单靠国家财政投资不行。５、调整折旧率，尽快补还铁路更新和大修理欠帐。有的来稿提出，铁路要发展，必须要制定一个有利于铁路发展的长期稳定的政策，国家应有专门机构和人员，根据国民经济发展的需要，制订这种长远政策和长远规划。另外，还有来稿对铁路分流、发展电气化铁路、铁路投资办法等问题提了建议。
    来稿中，对运价改革的议论不少。因为运费、车票上调价格，关系到铁路和各行各业，关系到千万乘客的切身利益。该不该调价？如何调法？都是热门话题。湖北省物价局郝诗渊说，“一次到位”，虽当时的震动比较大，但能稳定较长的时间。“分步到位”容易给群众造成频繁涨价的印象，加大心理上的压力。有的觉得要慎重，承德寿玉村铜矿王甫山说，铁路运价调整涉及到粮棉油盐等日常生活用品和钢铁、能源等生产资料的生产成本。不可大意。湖南溆浦县煤炭局彭卫则认为近期运价不宜大幅度上涨，小幅度，老百姓尚能承受。
