On January 10th, the merciless handcuffs were placed on the wrists of Wu Yucai and Li Qiuxia, who had preferred sons over daughters and harmed their own daughter.

The criminal Wu Yucai was a boiler operator at the middle school of the Yakeshi Forestry Bureau in Inner Mongolia. His wife, Li Qiuxia, was a worker at the same forestry bureau. In 1980, they had a daughter. Wu Yucai believed that without a son, he could not continue the family line, so he secretly had a second child. To avoid punishment under the family planning policy, Li Qiuxia returned to her hometown in Hebei Province's Gucheng before giving birth. Unfortunately, this second child was also a girl. Li Qiuxia left their 28-day-old second daughter, Wu Yan, with her grandmother and returned to Yakeshi.

In 1986, when little Wu Yan was three years old, her father finally brought her back. Unexpectedly, from that point on, Wu Yan became the punching bag for her parents. Wu Yucai blamed the lack of a son on his daughter, Wu Yan, and often beat and abused her. He hated Wu Yan for taking away his chance to have a son. He believed that only by getting rid of this "nuisance" would he have the chance to have a son. One day, the five-year-old Wu Yan screamed in agony for the last time and died under her father's feet, only to be thrown away.

Wu Yucai's criminal activities of harming his own daughter were discovered by the public security authorities. On January 10th, officers from the Yakeshi Forestry Public Security Bureau pulled the body from the snowy mountains. After a medical examination, the small body was found to have 51 injuries. Immediately, handcuffs were placed on the criminals Wu Yucai and Li Qiuxia. For such lawbreakers, they must be severely punished according to the law. At the same time, we hope that people will learn from this case: what serious consequences the preference for sons over daughters can bring!

　　重男轻女的恶果
    今年１月１０日，无情的手铐紧扣住重男轻女、残害亲生女儿的杀人犯武玉才、李秋霞夫妇。
    罪犯武玉才是内蒙古牙克石市乌努耳林业局中学的司炉工。他的妻子李秋霞是这个林业局的工人。１９８０年他们生下一个女孩，武玉才认为无儿无法传宗接代，便偷偷地要了第二胎。为躲避计划生育政策的处罚，李秋霞临产前回到了河北省固城老家。可这偷要的第二胎偏偏又是个女孩。李秋霞将仅２８天的二女儿武艳扔给奶奶，自己返回了乌努耳。
    １９８６年小武艳３岁，其父才把她接回。没想到从此武艳成了父母的出气筒。武玉才把没有儿子看成女儿武艳的过错，动不动就拳打脚踢，百般虐待。他恨武艳占去了他生儿子的机会。只有除掉这个“孽障”，才有生儿子的希望。一天，年仅５岁的小武艳最后一次撕心裂肺地喊叫后，死于其父的脚下，被扔了出去。
    武玉才残害亲生女儿的罪恶活动被公安机关察觉。１月１０日，乌努耳林业公安局的干警从山上雪地里把尸体拉了回来。经法医检查，这个小小的尸体竟有５１处伤痕。当即，无情的手铐铐在了罪犯武玉才、李秋霞的手上。对于这样以身试法的人，当然要依法严惩。同时，我们也希望人们从这个案件中得到启示：重男轻女思想会产生什么样的严重恶果！　　　　　　　　　　　　　王玉民
