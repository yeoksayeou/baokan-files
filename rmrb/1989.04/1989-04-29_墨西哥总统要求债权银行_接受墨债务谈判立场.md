Mexican President Urges Creditor Banks to Accept Mexico's Debt Negotiation Stance

Our reporter Guo Weicheng reports from Ixtapa, Mexico, April 28: Mexican President Carlos Salinas today urged international creditor banks to accept Mexico's stance on debt negotiations, reduce the net outflow of capital from debtor countries, and decrease the total amount of historical debt and interest.

Salinas made these remarks at a joint meeting of the Mexican and U.S. legislatures discussing debt and cooperation against drug trafficking. He pointed out that the Brady Plan, by recognizing the development rights of debtor countries, acknowledges the need to reduce debt and interest, aligning with Mexico's views and opening new prospects for solving the debt problems of developing countries. However, the urgent task is to reach an agreement through dialogue and implement it.

In today's plenary session, Salinas stated that the four fundamental issues facing Mexico-U.S. relations are external debt, trade, immigration, and anti-drug efforts. He noted that Mexico has unilaterally implemented an economic opening policy and demands that the United States correspondingly remove protectionist barriers against Mexican exports. He also called for the United States to respect the human and labor rights of illegal Mexican immigrants entering the U.S. Salinas added that since drug trafficking is an international phenomenon, relevant countries should effectively cooperate internationally to eradicate it at all stages from production to consumption.

The chairman of the U.S. congressional delegation, Representative Ron Dellums of Texas, expressed that the U.S. Congress will cooperate with Mexico on debt and anti-drug actions.

　　墨西哥总统要求债权银行    
    接受墨债务谈判立场
    本报伊斯塔巴（墨西哥）４月２８日电  记者郭伟成报道，墨西哥总统萨利纳斯今天要求国际债权银行接受墨西哥的债务谈判立场，减少债务国的纯资金外流，减少历史旧债总额及债务利息。
    萨利纳斯总统是在墨西哥与美国两国议会讨论债务与反贩毒合作的联席会议上提出上述要求的。他指出，布雷迪计划由于承认了债务国的发展权力，认为有必要减少债务与债务利息，与墨西哥的主张不谋而合，为解决发展中国家的债务问题开辟了新的前景。但是，当务之急是通过对话达成协议、付诸实施。
    萨利纳斯总统在今天的全体会议上说，墨美两国关系面临的四个基本问题是外债、贸易、移民与反贩毒。他指出，墨西哥已经单方面实行的经济开放政策，要求美国相应地消除对墨西哥出口产品的保护主义壁垒。他并要求美国尊重墨西哥进入美国非法移民的人权与劳动权。萨利纳斯还说，由于贩毒是一个国际现象，要求有关国家进行有效的国际合作，从生产、流通、消费的各个环节予以杜绝。
    美国议会代表团主席、德克萨斯州众议员德拉加萨表示美国国会将在债务与反贩毒行动上与墨西哥合作。
