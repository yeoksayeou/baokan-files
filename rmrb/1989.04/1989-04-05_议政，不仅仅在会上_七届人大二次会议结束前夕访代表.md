Deliberating on Politics is Not Just During the Meeting
—Interviewing Representatives on the Eve of the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress

By Reporters Xiao Du and Yuan Jianda

As the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress is about to conclude, what will the representatives do after they return? We interviewed representatives from Gansu and Henan provinces on this matter.

The representatives' thoughts varied, but they all had one common point: the meeting may end, but the work does not become any easier. Nian Anmin, a middle-aged female medical doctor and representative from Gansu, said, "How to strengthen the supervision mechanism of the People's Congress was a topic discussed extensively this time. There were fewer empty words and clichés, and I felt that this meeting was not in vain. Several representatives from Gansu Province told us that now, when the provincial or departmental leaders discuss certain work decisions, they often invite national representatives involved in that work to participate and listen to their opinions. Therefore, deliberating on politics is not just a matter for the meeting period. If we wait until the annual meeting to discuss opinions and suggestions, it will be too late."

Wang Ruozhen, the mayor of Sanmenxia City and a representative from Henan, deeply felt that deliberating on politics after the meeting is her duty. She said, "Next year, I will put in some effort to timely collect the opinions of the masses, invite everyone to discuss solutions to problems together, and let everyone focus on considering constructive opinions and suggestions."

Representatives from both Gansu and Henan provinces have a common understanding: to deliberate on politics, one must conduct in-depth investigations and research. They all oppose the method of "mass inspection" where representatives only meet with leaders, do not see the masses, only listen to reports, and do not delve into the actual situation, thus unable to propose insightful suggestions. Dr. Nian Anmin quoted an ancient saying: "'The roof leaks from above, but it is known from below.' To deliberate on politics, one must conduct on-site investigations, from sensory perception to rational understanding, to draw correct conclusions." He Zemin, the general manager of the First Tractor Factory in Luoyang, said, "After the meeting, I will go to the grassroots level, connect with the actual production of my factory, understand the needs of the farmers, and conduct some practical research. This way, when deliberating on politics, I will not just talk empty words."

Some representatives are concerned about becoming "representatives for 15 days, then having no effect afterward." Zuo Mingsheng, a professor and representative from Henan, said, "As a people's representative, I feel the responsibility on my shoulders is heavy. Currently, the supervision mechanism and procedures have not been established, and it is not easy to carry out regular deliberations on politics." Ju Xianren, a representative from Gansu and the head of the Gansu Provincial Democratic Alliance, also said, "Now the authority of the People's Congress has increased. Some people visit representatives before the meeting, hoping that their opinions will be brought to the meeting. Therefore, we always feel the pressure of being a representative." Some grassroots representatives have a deeper understanding of this "pressure." On one hand, they feel "insignificant and powerless," and sometimes the opinions and suggestions they propose are not taken seriously by grassroots cadres. On the other hand, there is also the issue of enhancing the representatives' awareness and ability to deliberate on politics. A party branch secretary from a village in Gansu said, "We need to participate in politics and deliberation, understand policies and laws, and definitely change the impression in some people's minds that 'farmers' representatives speak irresponsibly and talk nonsense.'"

The representatives' heartfelt words have increased people's confidence in the democratic construction process: in the future, the role of people's representatives will be further played out.

### 议政，不仅仅在会上——七届人大二次会议结束前夕访代表

　　议政，不仅仅在会上
    ——七届人大二次会议结束前夕访代表
    本报记者  晓渡  袁建达
    七届全国人大二次会议结束前夕，代表们回去后将怎么办？我们就此访问了甘肃和河南代表团。
    代表们的想法不尽相同，但都有一个共同点：会将结束，并不轻松。甘肃代表、中年女医学博士倪安民说，如何加强人大的监督机制，在这次会上大家提了不少意见，空话套话少了些，感到这次会没有白开。几位甘肃省的代表都告诉我们，现在甘肃省有了个好现象，就是在省级领导或部委领导讨论某一工作决策时，常邀请从事这项工作的全国人大代表参加，听取他们的意见。所以，议政决不仅是大会期间的事，对许多事的意见、建议，如果等到一年一度的会议再来讲，就会误事了。河南代表、三门峡市市长王如珍，深感会后议政是她义不容辞的责任。她说，她明年要下些功夫，及时将群众意见集中起来，请大家一起商议解决问题的办法，让大家能把精力用在多考虑建设性的意见和建议上去。
    甘肃、河南两省代表都有一个共同的认识：要议政，就要作些深入调查研究。他们都反对那种“大呼隆”地下去视察的办法，到那里只见领导，不见群众，只听汇报，不深入实际，不能提出有见地的建议。女博士倪安民引了一句古语说：“‘屋漏在上，知之在下’，要议政，就要实地调查，从感性上升到理性，才能得出正确的结论。”洛阳第一拖拉机制造厂厂长何泽民说，会议结束后，我要到基层去，联系自己工厂的生产实际，了解农民的需求，作些切实的研究，这样议政时才不致说空话。
    还有些代表，担心“当１５天代表，回去以后就不起作用了”。河南代表、九三学社河南省主委左明生教授说，作为人民代表，感到肩上的担子很重。目前，监督机制和程序都没有建立起来，要开展经常性的议政并不容易。甘肃代表、甘肃省民盟主委朱宣人也说，现在人大的威信提高了，有的群众开会前登门访代表，希望把他们的意见带到会上来。所以，我们总感到当代表有压力啊。一些基层代表，对“压力”更深有感触。一方面是自己“身微言轻”，有时提出的意见和建议，基层干部不爱听，不当回事；另一方面，也有一个增强代表议政意识和议政能力的问题。甘肃一位农村党支部书记说，“我们要参政议政，就要懂政策，懂法律，一定要改变有些人心目中认为‘农民代表说话不上道、信口开河’的印象。”代表们的肺腑之言，使人们增强了对民主建设进程的信心：今后，人民代表的作用将得到进一步发挥。
