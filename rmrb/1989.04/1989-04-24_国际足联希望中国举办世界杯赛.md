Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 23rd.

FIFA President João Havelange has stated that FIFA hopes China will become the first Asian country to host the World Cup.

Havelange made this statement during an interview with a reporter from the Swiss newspaper *Journal de Genève* at the FIFA headquarters in Zurich. The Swiss newspaper reported on the 22nd that Havelange said, "After the United States hosted the World Cup in 1994, it is now Asia's turn. I hope that we can propose China to host the World Cup in 2002."

According to FIFA's regulations for rotating the hosting of the World Cup among different continents, the 1998 World Cup will be held in Europe. Currently, France and Switzerland have expressed their interest in hosting this tournament.

Havelange also mentioned that both China and the United States are vying for the undeveloped football markets. Football needs a market, but the markets of the major European countries are already nearly saturated. Recently, all 50 states in the United States have indicated that they will prioritize opening the football market from the next century onwards. Given this, why not develop it?

Havelange further expressed his urgent demand to include the indoor 5-a-side football tournament in the Olympic Games.

　　国际足联希望中国举办世界杯赛
    新华社北京４月２３日电  据外电报道，国际足联主席阿维兰热表示，国际足联希望中国成为第一个举办世界杯足球赛的亚洲国家。
    阿维兰热是在苏黎世国际足联总部接受瑞士《日内瓦论坛报》记者采访时作出上述表示的。瑞士的这家报纸２２日援引阿维兰热的话说，美国到１９９４年成为第一个在欧洲和拉美以外举办世界杯足球赛的国家后，该轮到亚洲举办了。“我希望，我们能提请中国在２００２年举办世界杯足球赛。”
    根据国际足联在不同洲轮流举办世界杯赛的规定，１９９８年世界杯赛将在欧洲举行。目前，法国、瑞士已表示要争办这届杯赛。
    阿维兰热还说，中国和美国都在争取世界未开发的足球市场，足球需要市场，但欧洲大国的市场已接近饱和。近来，美国的５０个州都表示从下个世纪起要优先开放足球市场，既然如此，为什么不去开发呢？
    阿维兰热还表示，他将继续迫切要求将室内５人足球赛列入奥运会。
