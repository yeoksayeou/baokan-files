Title: Random Thoughts on "Deep"

There is a saying: "The heavier you are, the deeper the footprint you leave."

I disagree. So, I jumped, kicked, and stomped with all my might, only to end up twisting my ankle.

	—— Can deep things be naked?
	—— It would be best if they could. True depth is simple and genuine; it doesn't need much adornment. You might try peeking at those who claim to be "deep," stripping away their trendy or outdated layers of decoration, and you might find only pallor and bony frames.

	—— Scholars today are all following the footsteps of ancient sages, does this mean that modern people are shallower than the ancients?
	—— The ancients indeed had profound wisdom, waiting for modern people to delve into. However, there are also those who use the ancients to boast of their own "depth."

	—— If we replace the word "ancients" with "foreigners," would that be acceptable?
	—— It would be.

	—— A simple truth, after being isolated for a while, is praised as "deep" when it reappears, which is rather sad.
	—— This is not new. In an era of lost reason, common sense and ordinary views can only endure humiliation and submit to ignorance and absurdity. When reason returns, common sense will be seen as "deep" because it has been "absent" for so long. It's like a mathematician who falls seriously ill, with an empty mind, and then has to struggle to understand a simple mathematical formula.

	—— Wouldn't the same idea seem deeper if said first rather than later?
	—— Not necessarily. If a commoner says it first, it might be considered taboo; but if someone in a position of authority says it later, it might be praised as "extremely deep" or a "groundbreaking insight."

### “深刻”乱弹

　　“深刻”乱弹
　　伊人
    见有箴言曰：“你有多大体重，在此留有多深的脚印。”
    我不以为然。于是使劲猛跳，猛踹，猛跺，不料竟扭歪了脚脖。
    ——深刻的东西可以光裸身子？
    ——最好是这样。真正的深刻是质朴的、本色的，它无须多着装。你不妨试着窥探有些自诩“深刻”者，褪去其新潮或古臭的重重装饰，看到的很可能是苍白和瘦骨棱棱。
    ——今世学者纷纷步趋古圣古贤的堂臭，难道今人果然比古人浅薄吗？
    ——古人确有深刻的智慧，须待今人去深掘。不过，也有挟古人以自炫“深刻”者。
    ——假如把这段话换掉“古人”二字，代之以“洋人”二字，是否可以呢？
    ——也可以。
    ——本来是浅显的真理，在一度隔绝之后，复被人誉为“深刻”，总有点可悲。
    ——这并不新鲜。在丧失了理性的时代，常识和庸见也只能忍辱屈从于无知和荒谬；当理性复苏时，常识会因其“久违”而被视为“深刻”。如同一个数学家患了一场大病，脑子里空空如也，再要他领会一个最简单的数学公式，恐怕也须费神思索一番。
    ——相同的见解，先说总要比后说显得深刻吧？
    ——未必。一介布衣先说它，可能是犯忌；而在上者后说它，却可能会被人赞为“极其深刻”、“划时代的创见”云云。
