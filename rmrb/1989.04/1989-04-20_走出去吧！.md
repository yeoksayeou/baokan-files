	Step Out!
	Shangguan Jie
	Graduate Student, History Department, Nankai University

	Currently, finding a job as a graduate student is difficult for many. This is especially true for those in the history field.

	As a graduate student studying history, I really want to find a job in the Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Zone.

	It takes nearly two hours to travel from Tianjin city to the development zone by car. The landscape of the development zone is quite desolate, with only a few patches of green. A few newly built small buildings seem to be full of inferiority complex on this vast and desolate land, almost wanting to shrink into the ground. But the people in the development zone are enthusiastic, and we talked for about an hour. Later, they also had me accompany a reporter from a newspaper to tour around, to increase my understanding.

	We both showed interest in each other.

	Originally, the situation was clear: the specialty did not match. They needed economists, while I was studying the "ancient" discipline. But in this vast world, there are all kinds of possibilities, various crossroads. It is precisely in the patient negotiation that we found common ground.

	If I had been too insistent on the "mismatch" and did not go out to try; if I had blindly followed others' advice, feared rejection, and thus lost heart; if I had put on airs as a graduate student and did not pay attention to the strategy of conversation... what would happen? Nothing would be achieved. The world is full of infinite opportunities, but also infinite disappointments. For those who are self-satisfied and timid, the world will always be narrow. The key is whether we go out to seek and how we seek.

	Life is full of crossroads and choices. We are in the talent market for life, and those who enter this market have no reason to feel inferior and no right to be arrogant. Here, there is only choice and being chosen.

	If there is no bold and active choice, how can there be being chosen? Only with choice, can there be being chosen.

	Put down all burdens, step out of the ivory tower, and the world is boundlessly vast.

	For many years, graduate students and university students after graduation have been assigned jobs by the state. We, the "elite," have only been waiting for "heaven-sent opportunities." The development of the commodity economy has provided a broad competitive arena, and we should also adapt to this environment. Step out, that is a more vast world!

### 走出去吧！

　　走出去吧！
    南开大学历史系研究生  上官节
    现在研究生找工作，不少人都叫难。对历史专业来说，尤其如此。
    我这个学历史的研究生，很想到天津经济技术开发区找个工作。
    从天津市内乘车到开发区，用了将近两个小时。开发点的地貌够荒凉的，难得有几点绿色点缀。几幢新盖的小楼，仿佛在这片广阔而荒凉的大地上充满了自卑感，几乎要缩进地里。但开发区的人热情，一谈就是一个小时。后来又要我随一位报社的记者参观了一番，以增加了解。
    我们彼此都有了兴趣。
    本来事情明摆着：专业不对口。人家要经济人，而我做的是“古老的”学问。但在这广阔的世界里，充满了各种各样的可能性，有各种各样的交叉路口。我们正是在耐心的协商中找到了共同之处。
    如果我太执著“不对口”，而不去走一走；如果盲从旁人的劝告，怕吃闭门羹，因而自己先气馁了；如果摆出研究生的架子，不讲究谈话的策略……那将怎么样？一事无成。世界有无穷的机遇，也有无穷的失望。对固步自封、畏首畏尾的人来说，世界永远是狭小的。关键在我们是否去寻找，怎样去寻找。
    人生处处有叉路口，处处有选择。我们终生都在人才市场里，进入这个市场的人，没有理由自卑，也没有权利高傲。这里只有选择与被选择。
    如果没有大胆积极的选择，又哪来的被选择呢？有选择、才有被选择。
    放下一切包袱，走出象牙塔，天地无限广阔。
    多少年来，研究生、大学生毕业后，都由国家统一分配，我们这些“天之骄子”，只是坐等“天赐良机”。商品经济的发展，提供了广泛的竞争天地，我们亦应适应这个环境走出去吧，那是一个更加广阔的天地！
