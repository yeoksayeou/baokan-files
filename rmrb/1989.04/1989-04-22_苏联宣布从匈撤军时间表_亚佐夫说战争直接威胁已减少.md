Soviet Union Announces Timeline for Withdrawal from Hungary

Yazov Says Direct Threat of War Has Decreased

BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) — The commander of the Soviet Southern Group of Forces, Burakov, held a press conference in Budapest today and announced that the Soviet Union will begin partial withdrawal of its troops from Hungary starting April 25.

According to the previously announced withdrawal plan, the Soviet Union will withdraw 22 units from Hungary, including 1 tank division, 1 tank training regiment, 1 airborne assault battalion, 1 fighter aviation regiment, 1 chemical defense battalion, and 1 military academy, totaling 10,000 personnel, 450 tanks, 200 artillery pieces, and over 3,000 various military vehicles. This amounts to one-quarter of the Soviet troops stationed in Hungary.

Burakov announced the withdrawal timeline as follows: starting April 25, the withdrawal of armored vehicles and missile equipment of the 13th Tank Division will begin; starting May 15, the withdrawal of personnel and special equipment of the 13th Tank Division and the chemical defense battalion will begin; starting June 5, the withdrawal of personnel and equipment of the tank training regiment will begin; starting June 20, the withdrawal of personnel and equipment of the anti-aircraft missile regiment will begin; by December 1, the fighter aviation regiment will be completely withdrawn; and by May 1 of next year, the airborne assault battalion and the military academy will be completely withdrawn.

Burakov also announced that, to achieve the defensive goals of the Warsaw Pact, the Soviet Union will retain only anti-aircraft units within 100 kilometers of the Austro-Hungarian border. Therefore, the focus of this withdrawal will be on units stationed in some border cities in western Hungary.

MOSCOW, April 21 (Xinhua) — Soviet Defense Minister Yazov said in an interview with a reporter from the Soviet newspaper Izvestia today that the existence of NATO and the Warsaw Pact itself hides the danger of war. However, the direct threat of war has decreased.

Yazov said that both NATO and the Warsaw Pact military-political alliances have powerful armed forces and enormous nuclear potential, and these forces are used to counter each other. Due to the signing of the Soviet-American intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty and the agreements reached in Europe on certain confidence-building measures, as well as the progress made in resolving a series of international conflicts, the direct threat of war has decreased.

When discussing the progress of Soviet troop reductions, Yazov said that from March 10 to 20, 1989, the Soviet Union withdrew 1 airborne assault battalion each from the German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia. The Soviet Union has begun to reduce the number of tanks in the combined arms divisions stationed in allied countries, and by April 25, more than 700 tanks will be withdrawn back to the Soviet Union.

　　苏联宣布从匈撤军时间表    
    亚佐夫说战争直接威胁已减少
    新华社布达佩斯４月２１日电（记者侯凤菁）苏军南部集群司令布尔拉科夫今天在这里举行记者招待会宣布，苏联将从４月２５日起开始部分地撤出驻在匈牙利的苏军。
    根据早些时候宣布的撤军计划，苏军将从匈牙利撤出２２个建制单位，其中包括１个坦克师、１个坦克训练团、１个伞兵突击营、１个歼击机团、１个防化营和１所军校等，总兵力为１万人、坦克４５０辆、火炮２００门和各种军车３０００余辆。这相当于苏联在匈驻军的１／４。
    布尔拉科夫宣布的撤军时间表是：从４月２５日起开始撤出第１３坦克师的装甲车辆和导弹装置，从５月１５日起开始撤出第１３坦克师和防化营的人员及特殊装备，从６月５日起撤出坦克训练团的人员和装备，从６月２０日起撤出防空导弹团的人员和装备，到１２月１日完全撤出歼击机团，明年５月１日之前完全撤出伞兵突击营和军校。
    布尔拉科夫还宣布，为了实现华约的防御目的，苏联在距奥匈边界１００公里内的地带将只保留防空部队，因此这次重点是撤出驻扎在匈西部一些边境城市的部队。
    新华社莫斯科４月２１日电　苏联国防部长亚佐夫２１日对苏联《消息报》记者说，北约和华约的存在本身就隐藏着战争危险。但战争的直接威胁已经减少。
    亚佐夫说，北约和华约两个军事政治联盟都有着强大的武装力量和巨大的核武器潜力，而这些武装都是用来相互对抗的。由于苏美中导条约的签订以及在欧洲就某些信任措施达成了协议，加上一系列国际冲突调解工作取得的进展，因此战争的直接威胁已经减少。
    在谈到苏军裁军进度时，亚佐夫说，１９８９年３月１０日至２０日苏联从民主德国和捷克斯洛伐克分别撤出了１个空降强击营。苏联已开始减少驻扎在盟国领土上的诸兵种合成师的坦克数量，到本月２５日将有７００多辆坦克撤回苏联。
