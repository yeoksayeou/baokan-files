Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 7th.

The industrial production quick report released by the State Statistics Bureau today indicates that the total industrial output value in March was 11.04 billion yuan, an increase of 14.8% compared to the same period last year, which is significantly faster than the first two months. The production of state-owned enterprises has rebounded, but the growth of energy and raw materials is slow, while some obsolete and electromechanical products have increased significantly.

From January to March, the cumulative industrial output value was 29.22 billion yuan, an increase of 10.4% compared to the same period last year. In the total new output value, state-owned industry accounts for 33.04%, collective-owned industry accounts for 51.7%, of which township and village enterprises account for 30.6%.

According to statistics from 136 major industrial products nationwide, 70 types have seen varying degrees of growth compared to the same period last year. The total energy production increased by 4%, mainly due to the acceleration in March. Electricity generation increased by 3.2%, with hydropower and thermal power increasing by 5.2% and 2.9%, respectively; crude oil decreased by 0.7%, and fertilizer production decreased by 8.6%. The growth of electromechanical products is still out of control, and obsolete products such as sewing machines and tape recorders are still being produced in large quantities.

Experts analyze that from the development situation in the first three months of this year, the overly fast production growth rate in the first two months has been somewhat controlled, but March has seen a surge again. On this, it should be noted that after taking emergency measures, the development of energy and raw materials industries in large and medium-sized enterprises has been promoted; it should also be noted that the factors behind the resurgence are many and unreasonable. In particular, the large-scale production of obsolete products and electromechanical products has led to an even higher growth rate in collective industry, especially in township and village enterprises. The fundamental contradiction between the growth of processing industries and energy, raw materials, and other basic industries has not been alleviated. Most energy and raw material products are significantly short of the planned output, and the industrial production environment in the next step will remain very severe. The growth momentum in March should not be sustained. In organizing production, various regions and departments should focus on adjusting the product and industrial structures and avoid comparing growth rates again.

　　我国三月份工业增长速度偏高
    工业结构性矛盾突出
    多数能源原材料产品欠产　机电和滞销产品大幅增长
    本报北京４月７日讯  国家统计局今天发布的工业生产快报表明，３月份全国工业总产值１１０４亿元，比去年同期增长１４．８％，明显快于头两个月。全民所有制企业生产有所回升，但产品结构中能源、原材料增长缓慢，一些滞销和机电产品却大幅度增长。
    １至３月累计工业总产值２９２２亿元，比去年同期增长１０．４％。在全部新增产值中，全民所有制工业占３３．０４％，集体所有制工业占５１．７％，其中乡办工业占３０．６％。
    据全国１３６种主要工业产品统计，今年一季度有７０种比去年同期有不同程度增长。能源生产总量增长４％，主要是３月份增长加快。发电量增长３．２％，其中水电、火电各增长５．２％和２．９％；原油下降０．７％，化肥减产８．６％。机电产品增长仍未受到控制，缝纫机、录音机等滞销产品还在大量增产。
    有关专家分析认为，从今年头３个月的发展情况来看，前两个月过快的生产增长速度有所控制，但３月份又出现突进。对此，应看到采取应急措施后，对大中型企业，能源和原材料工业发展有促进的一面；也应看到再度加快的构成中存在许多不合理因素。特别是一些滞销产品和机电产品大量增产，带来了集体工业，特别是乡办工业更高的增长。加工工业与能源、原材料等基础工业增长不适应的根本矛盾并未缓解。多数能源、原材料产品比计划欠产较多，下一步工业生产环境仍将十分严峻，３月份的增长势头不宜持续下去。各地区、各部门在组织生产中，应在产品结构、产业结构调整上下功夫，切忌再度攀比增长速度。
