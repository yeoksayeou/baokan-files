The reporter listened to the discussions of the CPPCC members on education. Last year, they mainly talked about the importance of education, the insufficiency of educational funds, and the low salaries of teachers. This year, they paid more attention to exploring the issue of how to handle education in the context of a commodity economy.

On the opening day of the CPPCC, our newspaper published a lengthy report titled "Welcoming the Baptism of the Commodity Economy—The Confusions, Reflections, and Choices of China's Higher Education Reform," which sparked considerable discussion among the CPPCC members. Some education experts mentioned this article during their group discussions, while more members shared their views with the reporter. Some fully agreed with the article, others disagreed with certain points, and some pointed out its shortcomings while affirming its content. The most common opinion was that although the article mentioned the mission of education is to improve people's quality, it did not emphasize it enough, especially failing to address the core issue of moral decline under the impact of the commodity economy, to re-examine the function of education.

Quality Decline Cannot Be Ignored

One CPPCC member said, "Nowadays, the economy is developing, living standards are improving, but morality is declining." He recounted a recent experience. Once, while riding a public bus, he saw a woman holding a baby standing nearby without a seat, so he stood up and invited her to sit. However, as soon as he stood up, two young men rushed to take his seat. The member said to the one who had taken the seat, "I was letting the woman with the child sit, how can you snatch the seat?" The young man remained seated. "The two young men who snatched the seat, one in a suit and tie, the other in a coat and sunglasses, looked much more 'civilized' than this old man," the member said. "Beijing has already achieved universal education up to junior high school, and they must have at least completed junior high school, but their morality is so low, and their behavior so vulgar, their quality is worrying."

Qián Wěicháng, a member, said, "Many of our citizens are not qualified in terms of moral quality. They do not know how to respect others, do not know how to handle relationships between people, and do not know how to be a person. What we call quality, first of all, is moral quality, followed by cultural quality, physical quality, and finally professional quality. In the past, political and ideological education was used to replace moral education for interpersonal relationships, emphasizing class struggle. Landlords were generally considered bad, and the rest were poor and lower-middle peasants, but they still fought among themselves. Within the same class, there are also issues of personal relationships and character. Political and ideological education has some commonalities with moral education, but also differences. Strictly speaking, they are not the same thing and cannot replace each other. In today's new era of developing socialist commodity economy, it is even more important to improve the quality of the entire nation. National quality is a big issue, not only related to the success or failure of modernization, social stability, and the rise or fall of the nation, but also to whether we can stand on our own among the world's nations."

Huò Màizhēng, a member, specifically discussed the urgency of improving women's quality. She said, "Currently, there are 220 million illiterates in the country, 70% of whom are women. Among the 700,000 students who dropped out of middle and primary schools last year, 80% were girls. The low quality of women has a serious impact on the quality of the entire nation. Women's quality affects the nation in two ways: the lower the culture, the more out-of-plan births; the lower the quality, the worse the family education. Improving women's quality is an urgent task in China's educational cause."

Education Inside and Outside Schools Must Be Coordinated

The members believe that the decline in people's quality is due to various factors. Zhāng Guāngdòu, a member, said, "This is not just the responsibility of school education, but also involves party discipline, social customs, so we need to promote integrity and rectification, and leaders, especially central leaders, must take the lead. Additionally, it is related to the commodity economy." He made a statistic: one evening, there were more than 20 advertisements on TV promoting foreign goods, and some domestic goods advertisements also said, "Our factory has introduced advanced production lines from abroad..." He believed that such advertising would create a worship of foreign things and promote the pursuit of high consumption. Some members, however, believed that since it is a commodity economy, commercial activities such as advertising, including advertising for foreign businesses, are unavoidable. The negative effects brought by the commodity economy can only be offset through educational means, and more should be done to find the causes and solutions in education.

Huò Màizhēng, a member, said, "Today, when we educate young people on how to be a person, some of our nation's fine traditions must still be upheld, such as filial piety, respecting the elderly and loving the young, having love for others, etc. These traditional cultures are still deeply rooted in the psychology of those who grew up in the 1950s and the mid-1960s, so society was relatively stable at that time. During the Cultural Revolution, these were criticized, and after the Cultural Revolution, they were not restored. Developing a commodity economy, in school education, whether to restore these traditions is not clear, so people's minds are empty, how can their quality not decline?"

Reconsider Our Educational Policies

Some members have more in-depth thoughts. They consider the function of education, educational decision-making, and other aspects to improve the quality of the entire nation. Dīng Shísūn, a member, told the reporter, "There is a discussion that 'the development of the commodity economy has destroyed education.' This cannot be said. The development of socialist commodity economy is a necessity for China's social development. Education indeed needs to adapt to the development of the commodity economy. Your published article on this issue is correct. Your shortcoming is that you did not mention the mistakes in educational decision-making." He believed that a major mistake in China's educational decision-making is that it did not establish improving the quality of the entire nation as an educational policy. He said, "In the past, 'education serves proletarian politics, education combines with productive labor' was established as the educational policy. After the Cultural Revolution, the educational policy became unclear, with some saying 'education serves socialist construction,' I do not agree with these statements. I believe that the fundamental task and main function of education is to improve the quality of the entire nation." He believed that the mistake in establishing the educational policy is the main reason for the general decline in people's quality. Therefore, at present, it is necessary to launch a nationwide discussion on issues such as the function and policy of education.

Qián Wěicháng, representing the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, made a more comprehensive statement in his speech at the CPPCC meeting, clearly proposing the policy of "improving national quality and cultivating qualified citizens." When the reporter interviewed him, he also made some specific explanations. He said, "School education is mainly to improve people's quality. I have always been against 'talent education.' Professional talents cannot be solely educated in schools. In school, only some general basic cultural knowledge and professional basic knowledge are taught, the purpose is still to improve quality, and only when the quality is improved, can we talk about cultivating talents for the construction of socialist modernization. Of course, the improvement of students' quality primarily depends on the improvement of teachers' quality."

### 急迫任务是提高人的素质——政协委员谈商品经济冲击下的教育

　　急迫任务是提高人的素质
    ——政协委员谈商品经济冲击下的教育
    本报记者  毕全忠
    记者听政协委员谈教育，去年着重谈教育的重要、教育经费的不足和教师工资低。今年他们更注意从商品经济的背景下深入探究教育怎么办的问题。
    在政协开幕的那一天，本报正好发表了题为《迎接商品经济的洗礼——中国高等教育改革的困惑、思考与选择》的长篇报道，在政协委员中引起不小的反响。一些教育界的委员在小组发言时就提到了这篇报道，更多的委员在同记者交谈时发表了对此文的看法，有的表示完全赞同，有的不同意文中的某个观点，也有的是在肯定此文的同时指出了某些不足之处。意见最多的是认为该文虽提到了教育的使命是提高人的素质，但强调得不够，尤其未能抓住商品经济冲击下道德滑坡这一要害，来重新认识教育的功能。
    素质下降不容忽视
    一位政协委员说：“现在是经济发展、生活上坡、道德滑坡。”他谈了不久前的经历。一次他乘坐公共汽车，看到离他座位稍远一些有个妇女抱着幼儿没座位，他便站起来招呼那位妇女来坐。谁知他一站起来便有两个青年来抢这个座位。这位委员对那个抢着了座位的青年说：“我是让给抱孩子的坐的，你怎么好意思抢呢？”那个青年却安坐不动。“抢坐的两位青年一个是西服革履，一个是风衣墨镜，派头比我这老头子‘文明’得多”，这位委员说，“北京市早已普及初中，他们至少也上过初中吧，可是道德如此低下，行为如此粗鄙，这样的素质令人忧虑。”
    钱伟长委员说：“我们很多公民从品德素质上讲是不合格的，不懂得要尊重人，不善于处理人与人的关系，不知道如何做一个人。所谓素质，首先是品德素质，其次是文化素质、身体素质，最后是专业素质。以前用政治思想教育代替为人处世的品德教育，强调阶级斗争。地主一概都是坏的，剩下的都是贫下中农，但照样打架。在本阶级内部也有个人与人的关系问题、品质问题。政治思想教育与品德教育有共同的一面，也有不相同的方面，严格说起来不是一回事，不能代替。在今天发展社会主义商品经济的新时期，更要提高全民族的素质。民族素质是个大问题，不仅关系到现代化建设的成败、社会的安定、民族的兴衰，还将关系到我们能不能自立于世界民族之林。”
    霍懋征委员则特别谈到提高妇女素质的紧迫性。她说：“现在全国有２．２亿文盲，７０％是妇女，去年７００多万辍学的中、小学生中８０％是女孩子。妇女素质差对全民族素质的影响非常严重。妇女的素质在两个环节上对全民族的影响最大：一是文化越低，超计划生育越多；二是素质越低，家庭教育越差。提高妇女素质，是我国教育事业中紧迫的课题。”
    校内外教育必须配合
    委员们认为人的素质下降原因是多方面的。张光斗委员说：“这不光是学校教育的责任，还有党风、社会风气方面的问题，所以要廉政，要治理整顿，而且领导尤其是中央领导要带头。此外，跟商品经济也有关系。”他作了个统计，有一个晚上电视广告中宣传外国商品的就有２０多次，有些国内商品广告也说“本厂引进国外先进生产线……”他认为这种广告宣传会造成崇洋思想，促使人们追求高消费。有的委员则认为既然是商品经济，像广告包括为外商做广告这样的商业活动是不能避免的，商品经济带来的副作用只能通过教育手段来抵消，应更多的从教育方面找原因、找出路。
    霍懋征委员说：“今天我们教育青少年如何做人，我们民族的一些优良传统仍然是要坚持的。如孝顺父母、尊老爱幼、对人要有爱心等等。这些传统文化在５０年代和６０年代中期成长起来的人的心理上还是根深蒂固的，所以那时社会比较安定。‘文革’中，这些都被批判了，‘文革’以后又没有恢复。发展商品经济，在学校教育中要不要恢复这些传统，并不明确，因此人们的头脑中是空的，素质能不下降吗？”
    重新考虑我们的教育方针
    有的委员思考更为深入，他们从教育的功能、教育决策等方面来考虑提高全民族的素质。丁石孙委员对记者说：“现在有一种议论，认为‘商品经济的发展破坏了教育’。不能这么说。发展社会主义商品经济是中国社会发展的必然，教育确实要适应商品经济的发展，你们发表的那篇报道对这个问题的分析是对的。你们的不足之处是没有讲到教育决策的失误。”他认为我国教育决策中一个大的失误是没有把提高全民族的素质确定为教育方针。他说：“以前把‘教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合’作为教育方针。‘文革’以后教育方针就不明确了，有的说是‘教育为社会主义建设事业服务’，这些提法我都不赞成。我认为教育的根本任务和主要功能是提高全民族的素质。”他认为在确定教育方针上的失误是造成人的素质普遍下降的主要原因。因此，目前需要开展一个围绕着教育功能、教育方针等问题的全民大讨论。
    钱伟长委员代表民盟中央在政协大会发言中作了更全面的阐述，明确提出确定“提高民族素质、培养合格公民”为教育方针的主张。记者采访他时，他还作了一些具体的解释。他说：“学校教育主要是提高人的素质。我是一直不赞成‘人才教育’的。专业人才不能只依靠学校里教育出来。在校内只是教一些一般的基础文化知识和专业基础知识，目的还是在于提高素质，素质提高了，才谈得上培养社会主义现代化事业的建设人才。当然，学生素质的提高，首先有赖于教师素质的提高。”
