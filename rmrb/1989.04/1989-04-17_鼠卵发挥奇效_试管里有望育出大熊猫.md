Title: Mouse Eggs Show Remarkable Effect: Giant Pandas May Be Born in Test Tubes

No one would compare China's giant pandas with mice, but Chinese scientists have made giant panda sperm combine with mouse eggs, successfully conducting giant panda in vitro fertilization research for the first time.

Chen Dayuan, an associate researcher at the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and his colleagues conducted this experiment. The purpose was not to breed a new species that is neither panda nor mouse, but to explore new avenues for test-tube pandas.

In their recent research, they found that after the male pronucleus of the giant panda sperm combined with the female pronucleus of the mouse egg, the mouse egg released a second polar body—a prominent feature of the fertilization of higher animal eggs.

Pan Xingguang, an associate researcher of the research group, said, "The success of this experiment shows that the birth of test-tube pandas is no longer a mere fantasy."

Known as the "national treasure," giant pandas are distributed in the mountainous areas of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces in western China. Due to their increasingly narrow living environment, inbreeding has begun to cause degeneration of the species. Additionally, over the past 40 years, more than a thousand giant pandas have died due to hunting and diseases.

The reason they chose mouse eggs to replace panda eggs for the experiment is that mouse eggs have a small animal difference—they are like a low threshold that generally accepts fertilized sperm from other animals.

### 鼠卵发挥奇效　试管里有望育出大熊猫

　　鼠卵发挥奇效
　　试管里有望育出大熊猫
    据新华社北京４月１７日电　（实习生朱成沛）没有人会将中国的大熊猫和老鼠相提并论，但中国科学家却使大熊猫精子与一种鼠卵结合，首次成功地进行了大熊猫体外受精研究。
    中国科学院动物所副研究员陈大元和他的同事们从事的这项试验，不是为了培养一种非熊猫非鼠的新物种，而是为研究试管大熊猫探索新途径。
    他们在最近的研究中发现，大熊猫精子的雄性原核与地鼠卵雌原核结合后，地鼠卵释放出第二个级体——这一卵胞的突出部分是高等动物卵受精的突出标志。
    研究小组的潘星光副研究员说，“这一试验的成功，表明试管大熊猫的出现已不再是空想。”
    被称为“国宝”的大熊猫分布于中国西部的四川、陕西、甘肃三省相邻的局部山区，由于其生活环境渐趋狭窄，导致近亲交配，种系已开始退化。另外，在过去４０年中，由于捕猎和疾患，大熊猫死亡逾千只。
    他们之所以选择地鼠卵代替熊猫卵进行试验，是因为地鼠卵的动物差异性较小——有如低门槛一样，一般动物的获能精子都能接受。
