Xinhua News Agency, Washington, April 23rd.

The U.S. Secretary of Defense, Dick Cheney, said today that in the face of budget cuts, the funding for the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), proposed during the Reagan administration, will also be reduced.

Cheney, in an interview with the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), discussed the $299.2 billion defense budget for the fiscal year 1990, which will be submitted to Congress for approval on April 25. He said that the SDI, known as the "Star Wars" program, will continue to exist but will need to be adjusted to fit the reduced budget.

This plan, aimed at establishing a space-based anti-missile system, has been a contentious issue in the strategic arms reduction talks between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Over the next five years, the plan will receive $33 billion in funding, down from the originally planned $40 billion.

Cheney said that over the next one or two years, a series of cost-saving measures will be implemented, including delaying the production of stealth aircraft, reducing the military personnel by 8,000, suspending the deployment of the 15th aircraft carrier battle group, and cutting back on some weapon systems.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, April 22nd.

According to foreign news reports, U.S. President George H.W. Bush has decided to deploy the rail-mobile MX intercontinental ballistic missile and the road-mobile Midgetman missile to enhance the survivability of these two weapons.

The U.S. government and Congress have been debating the mobility of the MX missile for over a decade, with the potential federal budget deficit being a key point of contention.

The newly appointed Secretary of Defense, Dick Cheney, has proposed abandoning the development of the Midgetman missile to reduce the defense budget. However, Congress attaches great importance to the Midgetman missile. If President Bush adopts Cheney's suggestion, it would likely lead to a conflict with Congress. Therefore, he has adopted a compromise plan, making the MX missile mobile while also deploying the mobile Midgetman missile.

It is estimated that deploying a single-warhead Midgetman nuclear missile costs $500 million, while making all the silo-based MX missiles, each capable of carrying 10 warheads, mobile would cost only $5 billion.

　　美将削减星战计划拨款    
    布什决定部署两种导弹
    新华社华盛顿４月２３日电  美国国防部长切尼今天说，在国防预算面临削减的情况下，对在前总统里根任内提出的“战略防御计划”的拨款也难逃裁减的利斧。
    切尼在接受美国全国广播公司的电视采访时谈了将于本月２５日提交国会批准的总额２９９２亿美元的１９９０年度国防预算计划。他说，人们称之为“星球大战”计划的战略防御计划依然存在，但必须作出调整，以适应削减后的预算。
    这一旨在建立天基反导弹系统、因此成为美苏两国战略武器裁军谈判过程中一个争论不休的问题的计划，在今后５年中将接受３３０亿美元的拨款，而不是原定的４００亿美元。
    切尼说，在今后一、二年中将试行一系列节省措施，其中包括推迟生产隐形飞机、裁减８０００名兵员、暂停海军第１５个航空母舰战斗群的服役计划、削减部分武器系统。
    新华社华盛顿４月２２日电　据外电报道，美国总统布什决定部署铁路机动的ＭＸ远程导弹和公路机动的侏儒式导弹，以提高这两种武器的生存能力。
    美国政府官员和国会在ＭＸ导弹机动化问题上进行了长达１０年之久的辩论，导弹机动化可能造成的联邦预算赤字是辩论的焦点。
    美国新任国防部长迪克·切尼建议放弃发展侏儒式导弹计划，以削减国防预算。但国会却十分看重侏儒式导弹。布什总统若采纳切尼的建议，势必与国会发生冲突。因此，他采取了一种折衷方案，在使ＭＸ导弹机动化的同时，部署机动的侏儒式导弹。
    据估算，部署单弹头的侏儒式核导弹每枚需花费５亿美元，而将发射井中所有的可携带１０枚核弹头的ＭＸ导弹机动化仅需５０亿美元。
