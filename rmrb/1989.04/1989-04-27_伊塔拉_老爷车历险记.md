The "Itala" classic car, which departed from Beijing, has completed a 5,500-kilometer journey and arrived in Kashgar, the westernmost border city of China, on the 24th. The expedition team will leave China on schedule on May 1st and continue their advance towards Paris. In recent days, while the expedition team members have been busy repairing vehicles and sightseeing, they often discuss some unforgettable adventures they encountered within the Xinjiang region...

Fighting the "Yellow Wind"
The lowest depression in China—Turpan Basin, known as the "wind reservoir." Every April and May, this is the peak wind season here. On the night of April 18th, a fierce wind, carrying sand from the Gobi Desert, suddenly struck Turpan, waking the expedition team from their sleep. They were all worried about the next day's journey to Urumqi.

After dawn, the wind showed no signs of abating, and the sky was dark. The "Itala" classic car and its auxiliary vehicles, parked in the hotel courtyard, were all covered with a thick layer of yellow sand. The locals call this wind the "yellow wind."

At around 10 a.m., the expedition team set off.

On the 180-kilometer route from Turpan to Urumqi, the convoy had to pass through three major wind corridors, with the strongest winds reaching over 8 on the Beaufort scale. The winding and rugged roads, combined with the unpredictable wind directions, made the "Itala" seem like a small boat floating on turbulent waves, as if it could be overturned at any moment. Three Italian drivers, wearing large masks and goggles and dressed in winter clothing, took turns driving the "old car," carefully and slowly navigating the journey.

As the convoy approached the Tian Shan pass, the temperature had dropped to around zero degrees Celsius. At this point, a Chinese support van broke down on the road, unable to move and impossible to repair due to the strong winds. To protect the "Itala" with a cover, driver Manolo Marziollo slowly stopped the car. But as soon as he jumped down from his seat, the strong wind blew away his goggles and scarf. Manolo Marziollo quickly chased after them, fortunately, the goggles and scarf were stopped by a large rock on the Gobi Desert, and he managed to retrieve them. Meanwhile, a Chinese team member's hat was blown away into the distance.

When the expedition team finally safely exited the windy area and arrived in Urumqi, the dust-covered team members all breathed a sigh of relief, hugging each other in joy.

Crossing Gan Gou
On April 21st, the "Itala" departed from Toksun, crossed the Tian Shan Mountains, and headed towards Korla. Passing through the Gan Gou section was a particularly severe test for the "old car."

The 100-kilometer-long Gan Gou is a deep valley in the eastern section of the Tian Shan Mountains and a necessary route on the ancient Silk Road. It is said that the famous Tang Dynasty monk Xuanzang passed through Gan Gou on his way west to seek scriptures. The valley is dry and barren, with no vegetation. Although a highway connecting the Junggar Basin and the Tarim Basin now passes through here, there are still over 40 kilometers of unpaved roads. This section of the dirt road is covered with large stones, and the surface is covered with thick loose soil. The valley is flanked by steep cliffs, creating a "one-line sky" landscape.

Due to the extremely dry air and the scorching sun, the "Itala's" radiator quickly "boiled over." However, because of the large amount of dust, the protective cover could not be removed to cool it down. Therefore, the driver had to stop the car every now and then to cool the radiator. The "Itala" was moving slower and slower.

In the middle of Gan Gou, the right decorative light bracket on the "Itala's" front was broken off. The driver had to use a leather strap to tie the light in place, but the strap soon broke, and the driver simply removed the light...

The "Itala's" arduous journey through Gan Gou provided a spectacular scene for the accompanying Italian television crew. To capture these unforgettable moments, they had the busiest day.

### “伊塔拉”老爷车历险记

　　“伊塔拉”老爷车历险记
    从北京出发的意大利伊塔拉老式汽车，已走完了５５００公里的征途，于２４日来到中国最西部的边境城市喀什。远征队将于５月１日如期离开中国，继续向巴黎挺进。近日来，远征队员们在加紧检修车辆和参观游览之余，还常常议论起他们在新疆境内一些难忘的历险场面……
    战“黄风”
    中国最低凹的地方——吐鲁番盆地，素有“风库”之称。每年四、五月份，正是这里的大风季节。４月１８日深夜，一场来势凶猛的大风，挟卷着戈壁滩上的沙尘，突然袭击吐鲁番，把正在梦乡的远征队员们吵醒了。他们都为第二天驶往乌鲁木齐的行程担忧。
    天亮之后，风势有增无减，天空一片昏暗。只见停放在宾馆大院里的伊塔拉老爷车及其辅助车辆上都蒙着一层厚厚的黄沙。这种风当地人称之为“黄风”。
    上午１０点过后，远征队上路了。
    从吐鲁番到乌鲁木齐的１８０公里路途中，车队要经过３个大风口，风力最大的地方达８级以上。加之道路蜿蜒崎岖，风向变幻莫测，“伊塔拉”竟像汹涌波涛上飘浮的一叶小舟，似乎随时都有被掀翻的危险。三名面戴大口罩和防风镜，身着防寒服的伊塔拉车手都上阵了。他们轮流驾驶着“老爷车”，小心翼翼地缓缓行驶。
    当车队即将来到天山山口时，气温已降至零摄氏度左右。这时，中方一辆随同的面包车坏在了路上，既开不动，又因风大无法修理。为了给“伊塔拉”套上防护罩，车手万诺兹·马力奥慢慢停下车。可他刚跳下座位，强劲的大风就把他佩戴的防风镜和围巾吹跑了。万诺兹·马力奥赶紧去追，幸亏防风镜和围巾被戈壁滩上的一块大石头挡住，才追了回来。而几乎同时被吹走的一位中方随行人员的太阳帽，却消失在远方。
    当远征队终于平安地驶出大风区，抵达乌鲁木齐时，风尘仆仆的队员们都深深地松了口气，高兴得互相拥抱起来。
    过甘沟
    ４月２１日，“伊塔拉”由托克逊出发，翻越天山山脉，向库尔勒行进。途经甘沟一段，对“老爷车”也是一次十分严峻的考验。
    １００公里长的甘沟，是天山山脉东段一条深深的峡谷，也是古丝绸之路的必经要道。据说中国唐朝著名高僧玄奘，就是经过甘沟西去取经的。这条峡谷干燥少雨，寸草不生。尽管现在连接准噶尔盆地和塔里木盆地的一条公路干线从这里通过，但至今这里还有４０多公里路段未铺柏油。这段土路砾石累累，路面上覆盖着厚厚的浮土。峡谷两边则是陡峭山峰，呈现出“一线天”的景观。
    由于空气异常干燥，加上太阳的蒸烤，“伊塔拉”的水箱一会儿就“开锅”了；但因为灰尘太大，又不能取下防护罩降温，所以车手开一会儿就要停车，凉一下水箱。伊塔拉越走越慢。
    在甘沟的中段，“伊塔拉”车头右装饰灯支架又被颠断了。司机只好用牛皮绳捆住装饰灯，可车行不远，牛皮绳也断了，司机干脆把灯卸了下来……
    “伊塔拉”艰辛的甘沟之行，却为随行的意大利电视一台记者们提供了精彩画面。为摄下这些难忘的场面，他们度过了最忙碌的一天。
