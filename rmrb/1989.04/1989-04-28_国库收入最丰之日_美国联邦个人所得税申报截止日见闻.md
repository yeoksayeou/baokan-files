The deadline for filing 1988 federal individual income tax returns in the United States was extended by two days to April 17 (Monday) because it fell on a weekend. This day, many residents of Washington, D.C., rushed to nearby post offices and banks to pick up tax forms, and some even had to stand in line. However, the busiest place was the Internal Revenue Service building on E Street in the city center. When the reporter arrived, before he could even speak, the guard said, "Go to the eighth floor to get the forms!" – he obviously mistook the reporter for a taxpayer.

Three elevators were constantly moving up and down, but many people were still patiently waiting. The reporter casually asked an elderly black woman who was walking unsteadily, "Why do you need to pay taxes?" Apparently taken aback by the question, she hesitated for a moment before countering, "If we don't pay, who will support the police?" – she seemed to have been conditioned to think this way.

Upon reaching the eighth floor, the reporter saw a large room with two rows of shelves filled with various forms and booklets. Filing federal individual income tax requires filling out Form 1040, and all relevant tax regulations, explanations, and changes can be found in a 200-plus-page book called "Publication 17." If there are still questions, two friendly tax officials are available for consultation. On the ninth floor, there is another busy room with a computer and several employees ready to answer any questions related to tax filing.

The United States has two main types of income tax. One is corporate income tax, which is paid quarterly; the other is individual income tax, which must be paid by April 15 of the following year. There are approximately 107 million people nationwide who have income and need to pay income tax. The Treasury Department sets the tax rates and other details each year.

If a person earns $30,000 a year (a middle-income level), after deducting the personal exemption of $3,000, mortgage interest of $8,000, and property taxes of $1,000, the actual taxable income is $18,000. According to the 1988 tax rate of 28%, the actual tax paid is $5,040. If the taxable income exceeds $35,950, the amount above $25,300 is taxed at 33%; if it is below $17,850, it is taxed at 15%; if it exceeds $89,560, the personal exemption is not applicable; and income at the poverty line is tax-exempt. Additionally, the amount of tax paid depends on the number of dependents, marital status, and sources of income. There are over 60 blanks on Form 1040 that need to be filled out.

"Is there any tax evasion?" the reporter asked a tax expert. "There is, but very little, about two million cases a year," he said. On one hand, people have a strong sense of tax obligation, knowing that a significant portion of the federal government's defense, education, and social welfare spending comes from income tax; on the other hand, the tax authorities have a relatively comprehensive management system, making it difficult for individuals to evade taxes. For example, employers deduct income tax from any compensation given to employees and report it to the tax authorities. This also benefits employers because the more they pay out, the higher their labor costs, meaning less income, and thus the government collects less corporate income tax. As for cash income from illegal sources, there are only two ways to deal with it: either deposit it in a bank to earn interest or spend it on cars, jewelry, houses, etc. According to regulations, banks and commercial sectors must report to the tax authorities any account with a deposit of $10,000 or more and any sale of goods valued at $10,000 or more. Tax officials have the right to investigate the income sources of depositors or buyers. The federal tax authorities also audit 1.2% of taxpayers each year. If tax evasion is found, an additional 25% penalty and 6% to 12% interest will be imposed, and in serious cases, imprisonment may be required.

A consultant in his forties told the reporter that the federal government's tax-exempt items also guide consumption. For example, the government encourages private home purchases, so the interest on installment payments can be tax-exempt, which in turn supports the housing and building materials industries.

The evening rush hour arrived, and some post offices in the city center set up large mailboxes on the side of the road. Taxpayers only need to throw their tax forms out of the car window to complete their task. The New York Times reported that day, "Today is the day the federal government receives the most revenue – the total amount of personal income tax paid plus corporate quarterly income tax is approximately $900 billion, accounting for 9% of the national treasury's annual revenue. At least for the next month, the federal government will not have to worry about the budget deficit!"

　　国库收入最丰之日   
    ——美国联邦个人所得税申报截止日见闻
    本报记者  仓立德
    因为正赶上周末，美国申报一九八八年度联邦个人所得税的最后期限被顺延了两天，挪到四月十七日（星期一）。
    这天，华盛顿市不少居民都赶到附近的邮局、银行领取申报单，有些地方还排起了队。不过更热闹的地方是位于市中心Ｅ街的联邦财政部国内税务局大楼。记者来到这里时，未及张口，守门人便说“领单请上八楼！”——他显然将记者当成了纳税人。
    三部电梯上下穿梭，仍有许多人在耐心等候。记者顺便问一位走路颤巍巍的黑人老媪：“你为什么要交税呢？”大约是习惯成自然，她对这个问题大感突然，愣了半晌才反问一句：“要是不交，谁来养活那些治安警察呢？”
    来到八楼，只见一个大房间里摆着两排木架，放满各种表格和小册子。申报联邦个人所得税可填一千零四十号表格，有关税收的各种规定、解释、新变化，可拿一本厚达二百余页、被称为“第十七号印刷品”的书。若仍有问题，可询问两位态度和蔼的税务官。九楼还有一个人来人往的房间，里面的一部电脑和几名雇员随时乐于解答有关申报的各种疑难。
    美国的所得税主要有两种。一种是企业所得税，每季度交一次；另一种即个人所得税，当年税于次年四月十五日前交清。全国有收入、需交所得税的人约一点零七亿。财政部每年规定税率等细则。
    如果一个人年收入三万美元（属中等水平），扣除个人免税部分三千美元，再扣除购买房屋的分期贷款利息八千美元及房产税一千美元，实际纳税收入为一点八万美元。按一九八八年百分之二十八的税率计算，实交五千零四十美元。如应纳税收入超过三万五千九百五十美元，则超过二万五千三百美元以上的收入按百分之三十三交税；低于一万七千八百五十美元按百分之十五交；超过八万九千五百六十美元不能享受个人免税额；处于贫困线的收入则免税。同时，纳税多寡还要视赡养人口、婚姻状况、收入来源等而定，仅一千零四十号表格便有六十余处空白需要填报。
    “有没有漏税情形呢？”记者向一位税务专家请教。“有是有，但很少，每年约二百万例。”他说。一方面，人们的纳税意识很强，知道联邦政府的国防、教育和社会福利等公共开支大部分来自所得税；另一方面，税务机构有一套比较周密的管理方法，使个人逃税很难。比方说，雇主给雇员的任何报酬都扣除了所得税，并上报税务机构。这样做对雇主也有利，因为支出愈多，劳动成本愈大，意味着收入愈少，这样政府可少收企业的所得税。至于从非法途径获得的现金收入，无非有两种出路，要么存银行吃利息，要么购买汽车、珠宝、房屋等挥霍享受。按照规定，银行和商业部门对存款一万美元以上的帐户及价值一万美元以上的商品销售都必须上报税务机构。税务官有权调查储户或买者的收入来源。联邦税务局每年还抽查百分之一点二的纳税人，如发现逃税，可另加百分之二十五的罚金，还要付百分之六到百分之十二的利息，情节严重者甚至要蹲监狱。
    一位年约四十岁的咨询公司经理对记者说，联邦政府规定的免税项目还有引导消费的作用。比如政府鼓励私人买房，所以分期付款中的利息可以免税，这样实际上也扶植了建房及建材业。
    车如流水的下班交通高峰期来临了。市中心一些邮局在路旁特设了一些大邮筒，寄税单的人只须在座车里向窗外一投，便算了却了一桩心事。当天的《纽约时报》说，今天是联邦政府收入最丰之日——个人补交的所得税加上企业的季度所得税总额约达九百亿美元，占国库岁入的百分之九，至少在一个月内联邦政府可以不必为预算赤字犯愁了！
