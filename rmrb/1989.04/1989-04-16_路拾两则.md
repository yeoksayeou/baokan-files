		Two Incidents on the Road
		Liú Xīn

		(1)
		In a certain place, the tax bureau discovered that some tax collectors had stayed in one area for too long, becoming familiar with the locals, and had begun to demand various things from individual business owners. The bureau decided to implement a policy of rotating tax collectors to different locations every year. In the blink of an eye, a year had passed, and the bureau leaders went on an incognito visit, asking the individual business owners, "How do you feel about the policy of rotating locations?" One business owner said, "The root of the problem is whether or not one upholds professional ethics, not whether or not locations are rotated." The bureau leaders fell silent.

		At a banquet, a newcomer asked a friend who had been running a private enterprise for a few years about the "secrets of tax evasion." The manager proudly said, "Let me give you a real-life example. For instance, how do you account for this banquet? If everyone pays out of their own pockets, it's a loss. I find a friend who does transportation, ask him to write me a cargo shipping receipt, and then I can include it in my costs and offset my profits. That way, I don't have to pay income tax, at least I save half the money."

    某地，税务局发现有的税收员在一个地方呆长了，人熟了，有向个体户要这要那的问题，决定采取税收员一年一换属地的办法。转眼间一年过去，局领导微服私访，问个体户：“你们觉得换地的办法怎么样？”一个体户说：“根本问题是讲不讲职业道德，不在于换不换地。”局领导默然。

    酒桌上，一位新手向干了几年私营企业经理的哥们请教“逃税经营的秘诀”。经理十分得意地说：“哥们儿给你现身说法。比如说这桌席怎么报销？全让个人掏腰包就亏了。我找一位搞运输的哥们儿，请他给我开张运货的发货票，然后就可以计入成本，冲了利润，我这所得税就不用交了，起码省一半钱。”
