	Peasant Paintings
	Liu Gaogui

	The eternal moon is full,
	Illuminating the small boat as it gently sways, reflecting a few lines of clear green waves.
	A mountain path flows like slow water,
	The ending is often a few stalks of sorghum.
	There are red roosters coming,
	There are fish swimming.
	See a yellow brass suona,
	Gently knocking on the small window.
	Year after year, always letting the phoenix
	Fly over all the skies,
	Greening the fields,
	Fattening the cattle and sheep.
	There will never be a trace of tears,
	There will never be patched clothes.
	Always big red, big green, big green, big red,
	Red and green, slightly colored.
	Between the roads and the roads,
	There are bridges...

	I cried over the painting,
	I am looking
	For my painter brother,
	Where are you in the painting?

　　农民画
    刘高贵
    亘古的月亮满着
    照小船荡几线清绿的波光
    一条山道敲流水慢板
    尾声往往是几株高粱
    有红公鸡走来
    有鱼儿游来
    望一支黄铜唢呐
    轻叩小窗
    岁岁年年，总让凤凰
    飞过所有的天空
    绿了山野
    肥了牛羊
    从来不会有一抹泪痕
    从来不会有打补丁的衣裳
    总是大红大绿、大绿大红
    红红绿绿地稍作点染
    道路和道路之间
    就有了桥梁……　
    对画，我流泪了
    我在找
    我的画家兄弟
    你在哪幅画上
