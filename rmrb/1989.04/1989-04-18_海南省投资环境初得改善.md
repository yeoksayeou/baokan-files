Hainan Province's investment environment has shown initial improvement in the year since its establishment. The province has completed fixed asset investments totaling 149.99 million yuan. Priority and infrastructure projects have been ensured, significantly improving the previously backward conditions in transportation, energy, and communications.

In response to investors' most pressing concerns about energy, the Haikou gas turbine power plant and the first phase of the thermal power plant were completed and put into operation last year, initially alleviating the tight electricity supply. Consequently, more and more foreign investors, who initially approached with caution, have signed contracts with the provincial government. To date, 463 contracts have been signed with foreign investors, with a total agreed investment of $380 million, of which $114 million has already been utilized.

　　海南省投资环境初得改善
    本报北京４月１８日讯　海南建省一年来，已经完成固定资产投资１４．９９亿元。重点、基础设施项目建设得到了保证，使交通、能源、通讯落后的状况得到显著改变。改善投资环境初见成效。
    在投资者反映最强烈的能源的问题上，去年海口燃汽轮机发电厂和火电厂第一期工程建成投产，电力供应紧张状况得到初步缓解。因此，越来越多起初只是抱着试探心理的外商与省政府签订了合同。到目前为止，共与外商签订合同４６３项，协议合同规定客商投资额为３．８亿美元，实际已利用１．１４亿美元。
