According to statistics, between 1950 and 1976, the proportion of elementary school teachers in the United States who had received higher education increased from 50% to 99%, and the proportion of secondary school teachers who had received higher education reached over 95%. Almost every state requires elementary and secondary school teachers to obtain a bachelor's degree. Approximately one-third of public elementary school teachers and 40% of secondary school teachers hold a bachelor's degree.

Entering the 1980s, the quality of elementary and secondary school teachers became an even more important issue. Currently, in the United States, almost all secondary school teachers have completed four years of university study, obtained a bachelor's degree, and then received a teaching certificate to engage in teaching work. In the first five years of teaching after graduating from university, they need to take an additional 6 credits of relevant courses to become a permanent teacher. If they earn an additional 30-36 credits, they can obtain a master's degree. Currently, some states in the United States require secondary school teachers to have a master's degree. In Vermont, 70% of secondary school teachers hold a master's degree.

　　美国中小学教师的学历
    据统计，１９５０年—１９７６年间，美国曾受过高等教育的小学教师由５０％上升到９９％，受过高等教育的中学教师也达９５％以上，几乎每个州都要求中小学教师取得学士学位，约有１／３的公立小学的教师和４０％的中学教师，都获学士学位。
    进入８０年代后，中小学教师的质量问题更被摆到了重要位置。目前在美国，几乎所有的中学教师都是经过大学４年学习，获得学士学位，然后得到教师证书，担任教学工作的。在大学毕业参加教学工作的头５年里，他还需再学６学分相应课程，才能成为终身教师。如果再获３０—３６个学分，他就可以获得一张硕士文凭。目前，美国有些州已要求中学教师具有硕士文凭。在佛蒙特州，７０％的中学教师都具有硕士文凭。
