The State Forest Fire Command today issued an urgent notice on the massive wildfire that occurred on March 30 in the Snake Gully Forest in the Khorchin Right Front Banner of the Xing'an League in Inner Mongolia. The notice requires all regions to firmly implement various fire prevention measures during the current spring forest fire prevention period.

After the Snake Gully massive wildfire, leading comrades of the State Council paid great attention and repeatedly made clear demands. Yesterday, Premier Li Peng pointed out that it is now the dry season in spring with strong winds, making it easy for forest fires to occur. Leaders of all regions and relevant departments must pay high attention to preventing forest fires. Vice Premier Tian Jiyun pointed out that the climate conditions this spring are unfavorable for forest fire prevention. The northeastern and Inner Mongolian forest areas should enter the critical fire prevention period in advance. Efforts should be made to strengthen mountain clearing, blocking, and inspections, reinforce fire source management, and effectively carry out prevention.

The notice from the State Forest Fire Command said that all regions have paid great attention to the spring fire prevention work and have done a lot of work. However, this fire also exposed the fact that in some regions, the spring fire prevention deployment has not been implemented at the grassroots level, especially the management of people entering the forest areas and outdoor fire use is not strict enough. The Command requires that the leaders of forest fire commands and relevant departments at all levels in the localities must pay sufficient attention to the severe situation of this spring's fire prevention work, which is demanding, heavy in tasks, and difficult. There must be no slightest negligence in thought and no slightest laxity in work.

　　国家森林防火总指挥部就蛤蟆沟荒火发出通报
    春季森林防火切不可麻痹
    本报北京４月５日讯  国家森林防火总指挥部今天就３月３０日在内蒙古兴安盟科右前旗蛤蟆沟林场发生的特大荒火发出紧急通报，要求各地在当前春季森林防火期切实抓好防火各项工作的落实。
    蛤蟆沟特大荒火发生后，国务院领导同志十分重视，多次提出明确要求。昨天，李鹏总理指出，现在正值春天干旱季节，风势较大，容易发生森林火灾。各地各有关部门领导同志，对防止森林火灾要高度重视。田纪云副总理指出，今春气候条件对森林防火不利。东北、内蒙古林区要提前进入防火紧要期。要加强清山、堵卡和检查，强化火源管理，切实搞好预防。
    国家森林防火总指挥部的通报说，各地对今年春防工作很重视，做了大量工作，但这场火也暴露了春防部署在一些地区尚未落实到基层，特别是对进入林区的人员和野外用火管理不够严格。总指挥部要求地方各级森林防火指挥部和林业部门的有关领导同志，对今年春防工作要求高、任务重、难度大的严峻形势引起足够重视。思想上不能有丝毫麻痹，工作上不能有丝毫疏忽。
