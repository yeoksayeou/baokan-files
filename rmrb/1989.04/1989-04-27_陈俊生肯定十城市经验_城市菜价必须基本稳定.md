State Councilor Chen Junsheng emphasized today in Nanjing that urban vegetable prices must remain basically stable. Chen Junsheng made these remarks at the national conference on the exchange of experiences in vegetable system reform held in ten cities.

In recent years, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Wuhan, Harbin, Chongqing, Xi'an, and Nanjing have, to varying degrees, carried out reforms in the vegetable system. Chen Junsheng affirmed in today's meeting the above-mentioned cities' adoption of the policy of "near suburbs as the main source, far suburbs as a supplement, and external adjustments"; the establishment of different levels of commodity production bases according to their own conditions; the implementation of a combination of control and relaxation for vegetable production and circulation; and the various methods used by local authorities to improve the vegetable production and sales service system to resolve the contradiction between small-scale production and a large market, as well as the establishment of a vegetable production risk fund to ensure vegetable production and supply.

In discussing the issues that need further study in vegetable supply work, Chen Junsheng said that the first is the price issue. Vegetable prices must remain basically stable. Seasonal staple vegetables should implement planned prices, and prices of vegetables that have been liberalized should be subject to necessary and appropriate management. For a few staple vegetables in the market, prices can be controlled when necessary.

　　陈俊生肯定十城市经验    
    城市菜价必须基本稳定
    据新华社南京４月２６日电（中央人民广播电台记者沈渭渔、新华社记者孙参）国务委员陈俊生今天在南京强调，城市蔬菜价格一定要保持基本稳定。陈俊生是在此间召开的全国十城市蔬菜体制改革经验交流会上说这番话的。
    近几年，北京、天津、上海、广州、沈阳、武汉、哈尔滨、重庆、西安、南京１０个城市不同程度地进行了蔬菜体制改革，陈俊生在今天的大会上对上述城市蔬菜生产采取“近郊为主、远郊为辅、外埠调剂”的方针；根据各自条件建立不同层次的商品生产基地，并且对蔬菜生产和流通实行管、放结合的办法，以及各地通过完善蔬菜产销服务体系，来解决小生产和大市场矛盾，通过建立蔬菜生产风险基金来确保蔬菜生产和供应的办法给予了肯定。
    在谈到蔬菜供应工作需要继续研究的问题时，陈俊生说，首先是价格问题，蔬菜价格一定要保持基本稳定，当季大路菜要实行计划价格，已放开的菜价要实行必要的适度管理。对集市上少数大路菜必要时可以限价。
