At a gathering held in Tibet today, citizen representative Dawa said: Thirty years of democratic reform have brought a new look to the old urban area of Lhasa's Barkhor Street.

Barkhor Street is a bustling market and trading center in Lhasa, and it is also a must-visit place for religious followers to circumambulate and pray. Therefore, there is a saying: "If you come to Tibet and do not go to Barkhor Street, it is as if you have not been to Tibet."

Before 1959, Barkhor Street had only 115 small shops and stalls. By the end of 1988, Barkhor Street had 716 state-owned, collective, and individual shops and stalls of various sizes, with a daily turnover of over 120,000 yuan.

Dawa enthusiastically introduced: 80% of the households on Barkhor Street own gold and silver jewelry, 40% have televisions, 80% have cassette players, and two households own private cars.

In the past, there was not a single school on Barkhor Street. Now there is a public primary school with 662 students enrolled.

The representatives of various ethnic groups attending the meeting applauded Dawa's speech enthusiastically.

　　拉萨八廓街而今容颜变
    本报拉萨四月二十二日电  在西藏今天举行的集会上，市民代表达瓦讲话说：实行民主改革三十年，拉萨老城区八廓街变新颜。
    八廓街是拉萨繁华的集市贸易中心，也是信教群众朝佛转经祈祷的必经之地，因而有“到西藏不去八廓街，等于没有到西藏”的说法。
    一九五九年以前，八廓街只有小商店和地摊一百一十五家。到一九八八年底，八廓街的国营、集体、个体大小商店、商摊达七百一十六个，日成交十二万多元。
    达瓦兴致勃勃地介绍说：八廓街居民家庭百分之八十拥有金银首饰，百分之四十有了电视机，百分之八十有收录机，两户人家拥有私人汽车。
    过去，八廓街没有一所学校，现在有一所公办小学，在校生六百六十二名。
    参加大会的各族代表，对达瓦的发言报以热烈掌声。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（刘伟　卢小飞）
