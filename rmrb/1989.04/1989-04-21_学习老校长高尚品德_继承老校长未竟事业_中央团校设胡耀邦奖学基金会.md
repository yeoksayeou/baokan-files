Learning from the Old Principal's Noble Virtues and Carrying on the Old Principal's Unfinished Work

The Central Party School Party Committee has decided to establish the Hu Yaobang Scholarship Fund in memory of the old principal's great achievements. This was announced by the school's Party Committee Secretary, Zhao Ximing, at a recent memorial service attended by a thousand people.

From 1952 to 1965, Hu Yaobang served as the Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and concurrently as the Principal of the Central Party School for 14 years, making tremendous contributions to the school's construction and the training of young cadres.

The Central Party School and the Chinese Youth Political College Party Committee's decisions to commemorate the old principal also include: holding an exhibition on the life of Principal Hu Yaobang; compiling and publishing a book titled "Hu Yaobang on Youth and Youth Work"; and erecting a statue of Hu Yaobang on the campus.

During the memorial service, it rained outside, and inside, many people wept uncontrollably. Zhao Ximing, who had worked with Yaobang, recalled that Yaobang had always stood by the truth and was unyielding. During the Cultural Revolution, at a struggle session, the rebels wanted him to admit that he was a capitalist-roader implementing the revisionist line. He firmly replied, "I am not!" Some comrades who were being struggled against said a few words against their will under high pressure, and Yaobang turned back and said, "You shouldn't say such things." As a result, he was beaten.

Huang Gang, a student, could not hold back his tears. He met Yaobang in his remote hometown. Some students from Zhejiang, Shaanxi, and Yunnan also had similar fortunate encounters. Teachers and students expressed their determination to carry on the old principal's unfinished work and strive for progress.

　　学习老校长高尚品德　继承老校长未竟事业    
    中央团校设胡耀邦奖学基金会
    本报北京４月２１日讯  记者何伟报道：胡耀邦生前工作过的中央团校党委决定：为纪念老校长的丰功伟绩，特设立胡耀邦奖学基金会。这是该校党委书记赵喜明在日前举行的千人追悼大会上宣布的。
    胡耀邦１９５２年至１９６５年任团中央书记时，兼任中央团校校长１４年，为团校建设和培养青年干部做出了巨大贡献。
    中央团校、中国青年政治学院党委纪念老校长的决定还包括：举办胡耀邦校长生平事迹展览；编辑出版胡耀邦同志论青年和青年工作一书；在校园建立胡耀邦塑像。
    追悼会举行时，室外天公垂泪，室内众人泣不成声。曾与耀邦一起工作过的赵喜明追忆说，耀邦同志一生坚持真理，宁折不弯。“文革”期间，在一次批判会上，造反派要他承认自己是执行修正主义路线的走资派，他坚决回答：我不是！有的被批斗的同志在高压下说了一句违心的话，耀邦回头说，你可不能瞎说呀。结果，招来拳打脚踢。
    黄岗同学抑制不住，泪流满面。他是在偏僻的家乡遇见耀邦的。来自浙江、陕西、云南的一些同学也有相似的幸运。师生表示，要继承老校长未竟事业，开拓进取。
