During this year's national key first-class men's volleyball winter training, a three-dimensional volleyball net was set up. This net consists of two standard volleyball nets placed parallel to each other at a distance of 60 centimeters on either side of the center line of the court. The upper ends are connected by a strip net, with the top of the net slightly arched, forming a three-dimensional shape. The inventor of this net, young teacher Zhong Qianjuan from Guangzhou Institute of Physical Education, was formerly a player on the Guangdong men's volleyball team. Former Chinese men's volleyball coach Dai Tingbin and experts and coaches such as Zhou Zhihua believe that the three-dimensional net is more suitable for promoting volleyball among youth and the general public.

　　立体排球网
    今年全国重点甲级男排冬训练习场上，竖起了一种立体排球网。它是将两张相距６０厘米的标准排球网并列于场地中线两旁，上端用条型网连接，网顶略有弧度，形成立体状网。发明这种网子的广州体院青年教师钟前涓曾是广东男排运动员。原中国男排教练戴廷斌和邹志华等专家、教练认为，立体网更适宜在青少年和群众中开展排球运动。
