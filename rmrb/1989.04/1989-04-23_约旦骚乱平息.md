    Riots in Jordan have subsided, Crown Prince Hassan said at a press conference in Amman on the 22nd. He reported that eight people died in the riots.

    Hassan said the disturbances, which spread from the southern city of Ma'an to the northern town of Salt, affected many towns in Jordan. In the clashes between police and citizens, 89 people were injured.

    He said King Hussein would return to the country within 48 hours after his visit to the United States and then decide on the measures the country would take.

    According to reports, the Jordanian government recently reached an agreement with the International Monetary Fund on a five-year plan to raise the prices of some goods and service charges in Jordan as a measure to reduce the budget deficit, which accounts for 22% of this year's gross national product. The current riots occurred in this context.

    The riots began on the 18th. The government imposed a curfew in the three cities where the riots occurred.

　　约旦骚乱平息
    新华社安曼４月２２日电  约旦王储哈桑２２日下午在这里举行的记者招待会上说，约旦几天来的骚乱目前已平息，有８人在骚乱中丧生。
    哈桑说，这场骚乱从南部城市马安到北部城镇萨勒特蔓延到了约旦许多城镇，在警察和市民的冲突中，有８９人受伤。
    他说，侯赛因国王将在４８小时内结束访问美国回国，然后决定国家将采取的措施。
    据报道，约旦政府同国际货币基金组织最近通过一项５年计划，决定提高约旦一些商品的价格和服务收费，作为减少占今年国民生产总值２２％的预算赤字的措施。目前的这场骚乱就是在这种背景下发生的。
    骚乱从１８日开始。政府在发生骚乱的三个城市里实行了宵禁。
