	Zhao Ziyang, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, delivered a speech at a banquet hosted by Kim Il-sung, General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea. The detailed summary is as follows:

	In this season of spring and renewal, at the invitation of Comrade Kim Il-sung, the great leader of the Korean people and a close friend of the Chinese people, I and my comrades have come to your beautiful country for an official friendly visit, feeling particularly happy. As soon as we set foot on your beautiful land, we were warmly welcomed by the Workers' Party of Korea, the government, and the people, and we were immersed in the ocean of friendly feelings. Tonight, we are able to gather with the leaders of Korea to share our friendship, for which I express my heartfelt thanks.

	Please allow me to take this opportunity to convey the cordial greetings from Comrade Deng Xiaoping, Comrade Yang Shangkun, Comrade Li Peng, and other leaders of the Communist Party of China to Comrade Kim Il-sung, General Secretary, and the leaders of Korea, and to express the good wishes of the entire Chinese people to the fraternal Korean people through you.

	In 1981, I led a party and government delegation to your country for an official friendly visit. That visit is unforgettable to me. The long history and culture of Korea, the revolutionary spirit of the Korean people in defending national independence and building socialism, and the achievements you have made have left a deep impression on me. I have long been looking forward to visiting your country again. After I became the General Secretary of our party, I have repeatedly expressed that if I were to visit abroad, I would first visit the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, our close neighbor, to meet with Comrade Kim Il-sung and exchange views on issues of common concern, deepen mutual understanding, strengthen Sino-Korean friendship, and see with my own eyes the great achievements made by the Korean people in socialist construction under the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea. Now my wish has finally come true.

	It has been more than seven years since my last visit to your country. During these seven years, the Korean people, closely united around the Workers' Party of Korea and Comrade Kim Il-sung, have carried forward the spirit of independence, self-reliance, and hard struggle, and have achieved new and great successes in socialist construction. Your achievements once again prove that the Korean people are a hardworking, brave, and wise people, and the Workers' Party of Korea is a wise party. At present, the Korean people are actively responding to the call of Comrade Kim Il-sung and the Central Committee of the Workers' Party to strive to complete the third seven-year plan ahead of schedule, accelerate socialist economic construction, and achieve national reunification as soon as possible. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people deeply admire this and extend warm congratulations.

	The two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Korea have forged a great friendship in the common struggle against imperialism; today, in their respective socialist constructions, they support, rely on, and understand each other. This friendship was personally created and cultivated by Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Zhou Enlai, and Comrade Kim Il-sung, fully in line with the fundamental interests and wishes of the peoples of the two countries, and conducive to peace and stability in Asia and the world. We cherish this friendship very much and will make positive efforts with the Workers' Party of Korea and the Korean people to push this friendship to a new stage.

	Comrades, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government have always firmly supported the Korean people's struggle for self-determination and peaceful reunification. We closely follow the easing and stabilization of the situation on the Korean Peninsula. Since last year, the Workers' Party of Korea and the Korean government have put forward a comprehensive peace plan and various reasonable proposals for national reunification, making great efforts to ease the situation on the Korean Peninsula and create a favorable atmosphere and conditions for peaceful reunification. We firmly support this. We have always advocated that the United States should withdraw all its troops and military facilities from South Korea and stop joint military exercises that could exacerbate regional tensions, as this is contrary to the current trend of easing world tensions and is not conducive to the stabilization of the situation on the Korean Peninsula. We believe that the Korean people should solve the problem of peaceful reunification on their own without external interference. We believe that through the unyielding efforts of all the Korean people, the peaceful reunification of Korea will one day succeed.

	At present, the international situation is undergoing a turning point, shifting from confrontation to dialogue, from tension to easing, and this has formed a strong trend worldwide. Although various factors that cause international tension and turmoil have not been eliminated, through the persistent efforts of the people of the world, the goal of achieving a relatively long period of international peace can be realized. Facing this favorable international situation, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government will more firmly adhere to the line proposed by our party's Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee in 1978, which focuses on economic construction, adheres to the four cardinal principles, and persists in reform and opening up. Because of adhering to this line, China has made great achievements in all aspects over the past 10 years. We have achieved the goal of doubling the national gross domestic product two years ahead of schedule. People's living standards have improved significantly, and science, technology, education, culture, and other undertakings have also made great progress. Practice has proven that the line we have taken is correct. At present, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people are full of confidence, striving forward along the line formulated by the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, overcoming all difficulties, and striving to build our country into a prosperous, democratic, and civilized socialist country as soon as possible.

    中国支持朝鲜和平统一大业
    本报平壤４月２４日电  中共中央总书记赵紫阳在朝鲜劳动党中央总书记金日成举行的欢迎宴会上发表讲话。详细摘要如下：
    在这春光明媚、万象更新的季节，应中国人民的亲密朋友、朝鲜人民的伟大领袖金日成同志的邀请，我和我的同志们满怀着对朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜人民的深厚情谊，来到贵国进行正式友好访问，感到格外高兴。
    我们一踏上你们美丽的国土，就受到了朝鲜劳动党、政府和人民的热情欢迎，沉浸在友好情谊的海洋之中。今晚又能同朝鲜的各位领导同志欢聚一堂、共叙友情，对此我表示衷心的感谢。
    请允许我借此机会，转达邓小平同志、杨尚昆同志、李鹏同志以及中国共产党的其他领导同志对尊敬的金日成总书记同志和朝鲜的各位领导同志的亲切问候，并通过你们转达全体中国人民对兄弟的朝鲜人民的良好祝愿。
    １９８１年我曾率党政代表团来贵国进行正式友好访问。那次访问，使我难以忘怀，朝鲜的悠久的历史文明、朝鲜人民在捍卫国家独立、建设社会主义斗争中的革命精神以及你们取得的成就，给我留下了深刻的印象。我早就期待着再次访问贵国，我担任我们党的总书记以后，多次表示，如果出访，我将首先访问我们的亲密邻邦朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，同金日成同志会晤，就共同关心的问题交换意见，加深相互了解，增进中朝友谊，并亲眼看看朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党的领导下，在社会主义建设中取得的巨大成就。现在我的愿望终于实现了。
    自从我上次访问贵国已有７年多了，这７年间，朝鲜人民紧密地团结在朝鲜劳动党和金日成同志的周围，发扬独立自主、艰苦奋斗的精神，在社会主义建设中取得了新的、巨大的成就。你们的成就再一次证明，朝鲜人民是勤劳、勇敢、智慧的人民，朝鲜劳动党是英明的党。目前，朝鲜人民正积极响应金日成同志和劳动党中央的号召，为提前完成第三个七年计划，加速社会主义经济建设，早日实现祖国统一而奋斗。中国共产党和中国人民对此深表敬佩并致以热烈的祝贺。
    中朝两党、两国和两国人民在共同反对帝国主义的斗争中用鲜血凝成了伟大友谊；今天，在各自的社会主义建设中又互相支持、互相信赖和互相理解。这种友谊是毛泽东同志、周恩来同志和金日成同志亲自缔造和培育的，完全符合我们两国人民的根本利益和愿望，并且有利于亚洲及世界的和平与稳定，我们十分珍惜这种友谊，并将和朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜人民一道为把这种友谊推向一个新阶段而作出积极的努力。
    同志们，中国共产党和中国政府始终不渝地支持朝鲜人民争取自主和平统一的正义事业。我们密切关注朝鲜半岛局势的缓和与稳定。去年以来，朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜政府提出了关于祖国统一的一揽子和平方案以及各项合理倡议，为缓和朝鲜半岛局势、创造有利于朝鲜和平统一的气氛和条件作出了巨大努力，我们表示坚决支持。我们历来主张，美国应从南朝鲜撤走其全部驻军和军事设施，应该停止有可能加剧本地区紧张局势的联合军事演习，因为这与当前世界局势转向缓和的趋势是背道而驰的，是不利于朝鲜半岛局势的稳定的。我们认为，应该在没有外来干涉的情况下，由朝鲜人民自己解决和平统一问题。我们相信，经过全体朝鲜人民不屈不挠的努力，朝鲜的和平统一终有一天能够成功。
    当前，国际形势正在发生着转折性的变化，从对抗转向对话，由紧张转向缓和，这已经在全世界形成强大的潮流，尽管导致国际形势紧张、动荡的各种因素仍未消除，但经过世界人民坚持不懈的努力，争取较长时间的国际和平环境的目标是可以实现的。面对这一有利的国际形势，中国共产党和中国政府将更加坚定不移地坚持１９７８年我党十一届三中全会提出的以经济建设为中心、坚持四项基本原则、坚持改革开放的路线。由于坚持这条路线，这１０年来，中国在各个方面都取得了巨大成就，我们已提前两年实现了国民生产总值翻一番的目标：人民生活有了较大的改善，科技、教育、文化等各项事业也有了很大发展。实践证明，我们实行的路线是正确的。目前，中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，正满怀信心地沿着十一届三中全会制定的路线奋勇前进，克服一切困难，为早日把我国建成富强、民主、文明的社会主义国家而奋斗。
