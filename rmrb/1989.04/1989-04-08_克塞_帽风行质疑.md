After the Spring Festival, the streets of Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi Province, suddenly saw tens of thousands of children wearing red, yellow, blue, and green helmets similar in shape to those worn by motorcyclists. This trend quickly spread, threatening to overshadow all other children's toys.

What kind of trend is this? How did it start?

With these questions in mind, the reporter visited several of Taiyuan's largest department stores.

This children's helmet is also known as the "Kexue" cap, named after the Japanese science fiction TV series "Dino Express Kexue No. 50" that Shanxi Television began broadcasting during the Spring Festival. The series features a character named "Kexue" who wears a helmet and wields a laser gun, often saving the day by defeating alien monsters that threaten Earth.

Merchants are often more perceptive than ordinary people. They had factories produce batch after batch of these children's helmets, timing the market perfectly and flooding Taiyuan with them. According to salespeople, the main suppliers of these helmets are factories in Ba County, Hebei, and Yongjia County, Zhejiang. There are also individual vendors producing counterfeit versions. Often, within a single store, multiple departments such as toys, footwear, and hardware would all be selling these helmets. One counter might sell Hebei products, another Zhejiang products, and the competition was fierce. Sales representatives from the factories would actively deliver goods to the stores. Initially, the stores were concerned about sales, but the persuasive sales representatives claimed that a nearby major city had regulations requiring children to wear helmets when going out, making it seem like a genuine regulation. Coupled with the subtle influence of the TV series "Dino Express Kexue No. 50," sales quickly took off and couldn't be stopped. By late March, more than a month had passed, and the situation began to stabilize, but the helmets were still not selling out.

In the newly opened Tianlong Department Store in Taiyuan, the reporter chatted with a young man: "Is this for your child?" I asked, pointing to the red helmet in his hand.

"No choice, the kid is making a fuss, and I just happened to be in Taiyuan on business, so I bought one to take back."

"Where do you work?"

"Taigu County Agricultural Machinery and Hardware Factory."

"Ten yuan for one helmet, is it expensive?"

"Expensive or not, there's no choice. My child is only three years old, but every night after watching 'Dino Express Kexue No. 50,' he becomes the 'emperor' of the house, and no one dares to make a sound. During the day, when he goes to the kindergarten and sees other children wearing 'Kexue' helmets, he insists on having one too. In our county's government kindergarten, half of the several hundred children have this helmet."

"Isn't there a store in the county selling these?"

"There is, but it's more expensive than in Taiyuan."

At the Shaanxi Light Industry Department Store, the reporter asked a salesperson: "Do these helmets have any harmful effects on children's health?"

"How could they not? The TV said these helmets are made of polyethylene plastic, which contains toxic substances. Children hold and wear them every day, how could it not affect their health?" The salesperson seemed to have a point. "Besides, as the weather gets warmer, wearing the helmet all day doesn't allow for ventilation."

One salesperson told the reporter that they heard about a child in Taiyuan who, while wearing the helmet, imitated the "Kexue" character and jumped from the fourth-floor balcony, resulting in a tragic fall. At Shanxi University, a young teacher mentioned that in their office, a teacher's son imitated "Kexue" and jumped from a chair to the ground, injuring his face. No matter where you go, as soon as you mention the "Kexue" hat, people are very familiar with the term and often have stories to tell, giving you a glimpse of its impact.

According to relevant experts, the market for "Kexue" hats in Taiyuan is nearing saturation, and the peak sales season has passed. However, this trend is now spreading to various counties across the province. If it is not affected by the weather warming up and public opinion guidance, it is estimated that there will still be a significant market. I thought to myself, hoping not to hear any more stories of children imitating heroes by jumping from buildings or tables.

### “克塞”帽风行质疑

　　“克塞”帽风行质疑
    谢宝东
    春节过后，山西省城太原街头，成千上万的儿童头上陡然戴出一顶顶红、黄、蓝、绿的头盔来，形状与骑摩托者所戴的头盔相似。一时间，此风弥漫，大有压倒一切儿童玩具之势。
    这是一种什么风气？起始缘何？
    带着这些疑问，记者走访了太原市几家最大的百货商场。
    这种儿童头盔又叫“克塞”帽，名出山西电视台春节期间开始播放的５０多集日本科幻电视连续剧《恐龙特急“克塞”号》。该剧中有一个威力超常的人物“克塞”，戴头盔，握激光枪，威武俊猛，常常在危急的时刻由人操纵出击，将侵犯地球的外星怪魔杀得大败。
    商人的灵敏度往往超过常人，他们让工厂赶制出一批又一批儿童头盔，瞅准时机，大量投放到了太原市场。据商场的售货员透露，这种儿童头盔的货源主要来自河北霸县和浙江永嘉县两个厂家，也有个体商贩粗制滥造的“赝品”。往往在一个商场内，竟有玩具部、鞋帽部、五金部等几个柜台同时销售。这个柜台卖河北货，那个柜台卖浙江货，此消彼长，竞争激烈。厂家的推销员都是主动送货上门，开始商场似有忧虑，担心销路问题，但巧舌如簧的推销员竟声称邻近北京的某一个大城市有明文规定，儿童不戴头盔不准上街，似乎真有其事。加之有电视剧《恐龙特急“克塞”号》潜移默化的影响，销路很快打开，竟自收不住了手脚。直到３月下旬，一个多月时间过去了，形势才有所趋缓，但头盔仍然没有滞销。
    在太原新开的大商场天龙商场内，记者跟一位年轻人聊了起来：“给孩子买的吗？”我指指他手中的一顶红头盔问道。
    “没办法，孩子闹得不行，我正好来太原出差，顺便买一个回去。”
    “您在哪里工作？”
    “太谷县农机五金厂。”
    “一个头盔１０元钱，贵不贵？”
    “贵也没办法，我的孩子才３岁，可每晚一看《恐龙特急“克塞”号》，就成了家里的“皇帝”，谁也不准出声。白天到了幼儿园，见到别的孩子戴了“克塞”头盔，回家就闹着也要。我们县机关幼儿园几百个孩子，有一半都有这种头盔。”
    “县城里没有卖的吗？”
    “有，但比太原贵些。”
    在省二轻商场，记者问一位售货员：“这种头盔对儿童身体有没有坏的影响？”
    “怎么没有？电视上都说了，头盔是聚乙稀塑料制品，属含毒物质，孩子们每天手握头戴，能不影响身体？”售货员说得似乎很有道理，“再说天气转热，天天捂着头盔，也不通风。”
    有位售货员告诉记者，听说太原有个孩子戴着头盔，模仿电视台中“克塞”的模样，竟从四楼阳台上往下跳，结果坠楼身亡，造成一出惨剧。在山西大学，一个年轻教师说，他们办公室里一个教师的儿子，学着“克塞”的样子，从椅子上“飞”到了地面，脸部被擦伤一大块皮。任凭你走到哪里，只要一与人谈起“克塞”帽，人们不但非常熟悉这个新名词，而且往往都有故事讲给你听，其影响可从中略窥一斑。
    据有关人士分析，目前“克塞”帽在太原的市场已趋近饱和，销售旺季已过。但是，这股势头却正向全省各县城铺开，如果不受天气转暖和舆论引导的影响，估计还会大有市场。我听后则暗里寻思，但愿不要再听到孩子们为表现英雄气概而从楼上、桌子上往下“飞”的惊险故事了。
