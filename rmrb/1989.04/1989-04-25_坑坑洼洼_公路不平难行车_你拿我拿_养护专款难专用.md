	Potholes and Muddy Roads Make Travel Difficult, Maintenance Funds Misused

	Early this spring, after a rain and snowstorm, I visited the Baiyang and Xianlian roads managed by the Xiantao City Road Section. I saw that some sections of the road were filled with potholes, while others were completely muddy, with deep tire tracks over a foot deep. Several trucks were struggling in the mud, and pedestrians had to wear long rubber boots to move through the mud with difficulty. The responsible person from the city road section said that after a snowstorm in January, the Du Xi and Baiyang lines were cut off for 7 days; after a rain and snowstorm in February, the Du Xi, Baiyang, Xianlian, and Chengshi lines were cut off for 10 days, and the public was full of complaints, while the road maintenance workers were also very frustrated.

	Where did the road maintenance funds allocated by the state go? According to relevant personnel, the road maintenance funds allocated by the state are already very limited, but some departments treat the road department as a piece of fat meat, all wanting to take a bite, resulting in very little money left for the roads. Taking 1988 as an example, the small repair and maintenance material fees for these road sections were 517,000 yuan, but that year, various levies and fundraising expenditures reached over 100,000 yuan. The road section with the worst conditions, Zhongbang Road Section, manages 13 kilometers of gravel roads, with only 14.3 cubic meters of standard stone per kilometer, which is only 35.8% of the standard stone required for maintenance per kilometer. The road maintenance workers said that this amount of stone is not even enough to sprinkle like pepper.

	We appeal to the whole society to cherish and protect the roads, support the road department in using funds for their designated purposes, and ensure the smooth flow of traffic.

### 坑坑洼洼　公路不平难行车  你拿我拿　养护专款难专用

　　坑坑洼洼　公路不平难行车    
    你拿我拿　养护专款难专用
    今年早春时节，一场雨雪过后，我来到仙桃市公路段所属的白杨、仙联公路，看到有的路段坑坑洼洼，有的路段全是稀泥，车辙深达尺余，几辆货车在泥潭中挣扎，行人不得不穿着长统胶鞋在泥沼中艰难地移步。市公路段负责同志说，今年１月的一场雪雨过后，杜西、白杨两条线路断绝交通７天；２月的一场雨雪后，杜西、白杨、仙联、城石４条线路断绝交通１０天，群众怨声载道，道班工人叫苦不迭。
    国家下拨的公路养护费哪里去了？据有关人员说，国家下拨的公路养护费本来就很少，可一些部门却把公路部门当成一块肥肉，都想啃一口，结果能用到公路上的费用所剩无几。以１９８８年为例，这些路段的小修保养材料费为５１．７万元，而这一年各种摊派、集资支出达１０多万元。路况最差的中邦道班，管养１３公里砂石路，每公里路段保养的标准石料只有１４．３立方米，仅占每公里养护石料定额的３５．８％。道班工人说，这点石料撒胡椒面都不够。
    呼吁全社会都来爱路护路，支持公路部门专款专用，保证公路畅通无阻。
