Two Historical Breakthroughs

From the May Fourth New Culture Movement to the Modern Cultural Consciousness of the New Era

Liu Zaifu

Summary: During the May Fourth New Culture Movement, Chinese intellectuals, while playing the role of historical enlightenment, not only enlightened others but also defined themselves. The literary spirit of the May Fourth era was a manifestation of modern cultural consciousness such as science, democracy, and individual liberation. In the 1920s, due to the dark reality of society and the urgent task of national salvation, the focus of society shifted to political revolution, and the attention of history shifted to the peasants who formed the main force of the political movement. On the other hand, the split cultural character of intellectuals lacked a strong subjectivity and individuality, making it difficult for them to play a firm historical role. In the past decade, intellectuals have undergone a significant transformation, moving from a stage where their value position was negated by external forces to a stage of affirmation. After the modern cultural value scale of intellectuals was established, the spirit of enlightenment shifted from loss to return, and literature entered an era of multi-competitive based on individuality.

In the 20th century, Chinese intellectuals achieved two historical breakthroughs in the literary field: the first occurred in the first half of the century. Chinese intellectuals finally broke free from the shackles of feudal scholar-official spirit, began to accept various humanistic spirits that advocate democracy and science from the West, including scientific socialism, and completed the literary revolution of replacing the classical Chinese system with the vernacular system. Thus, the first page of Chinese new literature was turned, and the great project of new literature with modern significance was initiated. The second breakthrough occurred in the past decade. In this decade, Chinese intellectuals broke free from the rigid ideological constraints of uniformity, broke through the single-patterned creation model and theoretical framework, and completed the transformation from a single literary structure to a pluralistic literary structure.

Phenomenon: The Exchange of Historical Roles and the Loss of Enlightenment Spirit

Chinese intellectuals, as the main body of the May Fourth New Culture Movement, played the role of enlightenment in the movement, as well as the role of social reformers and national character reformers. Their enlightenment was not mainly the transmission of knowledge, but the enlightenment of people's inner spirit and inner dignity, the refutation of feudal patriarchal ideas, and the advocacy of modern cultural consciousness such as science, democracy, and individual liberation.

In the literary field, representatives such as Chen Duxiu, Lu Xun, Hu Shi, and Zhou Zuoren raised the banner of literary revolution, broke through the traditional literary models and human models, advocated "enlightenment," and opened the first page of modern Chinese new literature. Over the past 70 years, the enlightenment spirit they advocated has not developed in a straight line; it has undergone a process of loss and return. Today, reviewing this process is not meaningless.

In the May Fourth New Literature Movement, while intellectuals played the role of historical enlightenment, they not only enlightened others but also defined themselves. This self-definition meant defining themselves as the self of a new century, as an independent personality with modern cultural significance. This self-definition enabled them to break free from the cultural character of feudal scholar-officials, abandon the basic idea of "speaking on behalf of the sages," and establish a position of spiritual subjectivity.

The writers of the May Fourth era and the intellectuals of the same era, as the first recipients of Western humanistic spirit, indeed played a vanguard role in various aspects. However, this vanguard position and enlightenment role were soon gradually weakened, diluted, and even negated, leading to an exchange of historical roles. That is, intellectuals, as the enlightened and enlighteners, became the objects of enlightenment and transformation, while the peasants, who were previously pitied for their misfortune and angered for their lack of struggle, became the subjects of transformation and the subjects of re-education for intellectuals. In this process of historical role exchange, the enlightenment spirit and self-consciousness represented by intellectuals were gradually lost.

After the 1940s, works like "The True Story of Ah Q" that used a modern perspective to view the ignorance and backwardness of peasants with strong enlightenment power almost disappeared. In their place were works like Zhao Shuli's that sang the praises of peasant revolution. Attempts to maintain the basic ideas of May Fourth works and continue the subjectivity of intellectuals in life became increasingly difficult. In 1942, Ding Ling's novel "In the Hospital" was criticized, which was a typical example. This criticism marked an important turning point, indicating that the literary era dominated by intellectuals had ended in a historical stage. Afterward, not only did works like "In the Hospital" disappear in the liberated areas, but works that directly depicted the image of intellectuals also vanished. Even if a few characters with intellectual features appeared, their identity was that of cadres or cadres sent to the countryside. For example, in Wei Junyi's "Three Friends," the intellectuals were already half cadres and half intellectuals, and their thinking had undergone a qualitative change from the May Fourth era, beginning to self-deprecate.

After liberation, this trend became the legal trend in literary works under new social conditions. Literary works could only sing the praises of workers and peasants; otherwise, they would be defaming the working people. They could only criticize intellectuals; otherwise, they would be beautifying intellectuals. Post-liberation literary works rarely featured intellectuals as the protagonists. In works with workers, peasants, and soldiers as the protagonists, intellectuals were inevitably depicted as objects of transformation. In these works, the subjectivity of intellectuals as enlighteners had been completely lost. And these works were precisely written by intellectuals. Intellectuals, in order to prove their value, had to write, but what they wrote had to self-deprecate—to prove their worthlessness in order to be published (to be recognized as valuable by external forces). At that time, writers were trapped in this tragic vicious circle.

The reason intellectuals produced various abnormal phenomena and negated their own image through their own pen was that they could not help but accept the concept of intellectuals that had been universally established in society. This concept defined intellectuals within the category of the "petty bourgeoisie"; it pointed out that the petty bourgeoisie intellectuals had a spiritual kingdom deep in their souls that needed to be transformed. After liberation, intellectuals were further defined within the category of the bourgeoisie, and due to the slogan of "eliminating the bourgeoisie to promote the proletariat," the transformation of intellectuals gradually shifted from a voluntary nature to a compulsory nature through political criticism movements. After the political movements to criticize Yu Pingbo, the Hu Feng group, and the "rightists" were launched, the political sense of guilt of intellectuals was further strengthened. In the eyes of society, intellectuals had already lost their positive image. During the Cultural Revolution, when the statement that "schools are controlled by the bourgeoisie" was put forward, intellectuals became an alien force to the working class. With the great reversal of the concept of intellectuals in society, intellectuals lost more and more confidence, lost more and more independent spirit and independent personality. They not only "kept their tails between their legs" but also constantly criticized, denied, and enslaved themselves. Under the name of "sincerity," they emptied their souls and purified all "horizontal" relationships, believing that the meaning of life lay in self-transformation. The more thorough the transformation, the more thorough the self-deprecation, the more secure they felt, the more gratified they felt. The pathological recognition of intellectuals by society and the pathological psychology of intellectuals themselves made the value of intellectuals drop to zero, and even to a negative number—not as human beings, but as "monsters and demons." At this point, even a great writer like Ba Jin shouted the slogan "Down with Ba Jin." In short, intellectuals completely lost their sense of self-existence and self-determination. In this social and psychological atmosphere, the "enlightenment" of writers had long become a nightmare of the past.

Reason: The Shift of Social Movement Focus and Insufficient Real Conditions

Why did Chinese intellectuals soon begin to negate themselves after the May Fourth era? Why did they lose the spirit of enlightenment and exchange historical roles with peasants?

In the mid-1920s, when some Chinese intellectuals began to abandon themselves, they were not facing the pressure of tyranny, but rather their own internal demands. That era was a very special era. After the Xinhai Revolution, Sun Yat-sen no longer served as the president, Yuan Shikai had died, and there were disputes between Li Yuanhong and Duan Qirui. The era lacked authority, and correspondingly, the entire country was "out of control." In this situation of dispersed central power, intellectuals had more freedom of choice. They could have developed their individuality to the extreme. However, at that time, intellectuals faced another pressure, that is, the survival crisis of the national group. After the May Fourth era, the demand for individual development and the anxiety of national survival crisis were intertwined, making intellectuals with strong patriotic enthusiasm face a dilemma. However, the survival crisis of the national group ultimately constituted the strongest stimulus.

Intellectuals in the May Fourth era were in an unquestionable position of enlightenment, which was inseparable from the fact that the focus of the May Fourth movement was initially cultural revolution rather than political revolution. The May Fourth New Culture Movement in China was first a result of the reflection after the failure of the Xinhai Revolution. After the Xinhai Revolution, phenomena such as Yuan Shikai's usurpation of power, Zhang Xun's restoration, and the warlord strife appeared. The Xinhai Revolution, which was full of hope, except for cutting off a queue, China remained the same. This could not but give intellectuals a great stimulus. They realized at this time that to save the nation, political revolution with a salvational nature was not enough; cultural revolution with an enlightening nature was also needed. Therefore, the pioneers of the May Fourth era founded the "New Youth" magazine, starting from literature, launched a thought revolution and cultural revolution. In the cultural revolution with an enlightening nature, intellectuals who mastered culture were naturally the main body of the cultural revolution, and naturally took the initiative in the role of enlightenment.

However, due to the extreme darkness of social reality and the extreme urgency of the national salvation task, these intellectuals engaged in cultural revolution found that pure cultural revolution was not enough. Therefore, the focus of social movement shifted to political revolution. After the May Fourth era, the Chinese Communist Party and the mass movements led by it appeared, and the May Fourth movement and the Northern Expedition were signs of the shift of social movement focus to political revolution. In political revolution, complex thought enlightenment was not needed. Political revolution simplified people, and political revolution itself needed simplification. Political revolution was a large-scale mass movement that needed simple incitement and slogans that could immediately ignite revolutionary flames, rather than transcendental abstract enlightenment principles. Political revolution did not need to be as complex as cultural movements, and this special requirement naturally weakened the role of intellectuals. On the other hand, the focus of history had to shift to the main force of the political movement, and peasants were precisely the main force of the Chinese democratic revolution. Thus, the exchange of historical protagonists became possible.

After the mid-1920s, political revolution intensified, and on the one hand, intellectuals felt powerless and denied the enlightenment literature of the May Fourth era. On the other hand, when affirming the political role of peasants, they overestimated the cultural awareness of peasants.

The most typical article reflecting this trend was Qian Xingcun's "The Dead Era of Ah Q." Qian Xingcun said in this article: "The peasants now are not the peasants of the Xinhai Revolution era. The interests of the peasants now have shifted from individualism to the path of political revolution!" Based on the above view, Qian Xingcun announced: "The era of Ah Q is long dead! The era of Ah Q is dead and far away!" (Selected Materials on Literary Movement, Volume 2, Shanghai Education Press, 1979 edition) Qian Xingcun's article is an important coordinate, reflecting the basic change in the recognition of peasants by a large part of intellectuals at that time.

In this process, the discussion on the popularization of literature in the 1930s more fiercely criticized the May Fourth literary movement and even the revolutionary literary movement, and for the first time defined the May Fourth new literature writers as "petty bourgeoisie writers," and severely criticized the writers for not "learning from the masses" but "teaching the masses," clearly criticizing the May Fourth new literature writers for playing a wrong historical role. The result of the discussion on the popularization of literature in the 1930s was to further cause the loss of the enlightenment spirit of the May Fourth era. However, it should be noted that the advocates of "literary popularization" believed that the main problem of literary popularization was the language problem and the problem of using old forms (which was also the problem of vulgarization and alienation from the masses), and did not think that the main problem was the problem of stance and emotional attitude. Naturally, they did not think that it was necessary to thoroughly transform their own stance and emotional attitude. The proposition of "transformation" was formally put forward in the 1940s.

However, the above political reasons (the need for national salvation and the shift of the focus of social movement) still could not explain a phenomenon, that is, after the May Fourth literary revolution retreated in the mid-1920s, writers generally fell into a great spiritual crisis and a state of great distress. At that time, Lu Xun declared in the "Preface" of "Graves" that he wanted to "bury" the past things. This sentiment of breaking with the past had universality. Lu Xun once described that at that time, some people retired, some fled, some were depressed, and some betrayed. Therefore, he felt extremely lonely, "Two rooms left with one soldier, holding a spear and wandering alone." At that time, a general sense of distress, wandering, and loneliness, and a mood of seeking a new path indeed appeared. If we saw in the May Fourth era the passionate and imaginative shouting of Guo Moruo and the pure, enthusiastic, and dream-filled love of the Lake Poets (Ying Si, Pan Mojie, etc.), then in this period, we saw Lu Xun's loneliness and wandering, and the disappearance of the pure and beautiful love and dreams of the Lake Poets.

We must raise a question from this major phenomenon, that is, during the period of the occurrence and development of the May Fourth New Culture Movement (approximately from 1915 to 1923), the survival crisis of the nation was equally tragic, but in this environment, why was the attitude of writers so active, enthusiastic, and righteous in advocating individuality, while in the mid-1920s, a general sense of distress appeared? Was there another more internal and important reason for the general distress of writers in the mid-1920s?

Here, we must affirmatively answer that the survival crisis of the national group was not the absolute reason for intellectuals to abandon the spirit of individuality and enlightenment. In the survival crisis of the national group, individuality could also be developed. However, the key issue is: after the May Fourth Movement, there was no real soil for the individuality of intellectuals to continue to grow and develop. The May Fourth Movement, as a turning point in Chinese history, marked a great transformation of Chinese society. However, this transformation was not entirely normal. It directly transformed from a feudal society to a modern society, but did not create a strong class of free professionals and the corresponding modern political, economic, and cultural foundations. The final outcome of the May Fourth New Culture Movement was entirely based on the superstructure, that is, it was based on political struggles to seize power and change the political structure. The task of social revolution included economic revolution, and it was necessary to change the economic form through seizing power. However, after the May Fourth era, the small peasant economy, which was the basis for the survival of traditional culture, remained unchanged, and the order of free competition in commodity economy did not form. Ah Q's hometown, Weizhuang, was still a place where small producers and their small-scale natural economy and small-scale ideas dominated. The economic structure of Weizhuang type naturally rejected the spirit of science and democracy, and naturally rejected individualism and the independent spirit of intellectuals.

From the formation of social consciousness, without the corresponding material relations, it is impossible to have a strong individuality and a strong independence of intellectuals. Our new intellectuals' modern souls lack a fully developed and grown soil and lack a natural growth process. Therefore, they are very fragile. The reason why our modern intellectuals stood up in the May Fourth era and formed a literary and ideological force was mainly due to the influence of Western cultural trends. But due to the lack of a strong economic foundation, cultural foundation, and group foundation, they soon found themselves trapped in a cultural chasm of the times. Their enlightenment thoughts and individuality-filled songs found no resonance, and their love and calls were distorted and out of tune after echoing on the walls of the hearts of Ah Q and his ilk. Thus, they became lonely, wandering, and desolate. This could not but lead to despair. The process of the development of modern souls and modern individuality in the West was a long, slow process, a process of natural growth and development over several centuries, which obtained the coordination of various external conditions such as politics, economy, culture, and thought. However, our May Fourth New Literature Movement developed abnormally rapidly, and individualism and the independent spirit of intellectuals suddenly erupted. It lacked the corresponding external conditions. Therefore, new literature writers were very easy to become sentimental and disillusioned, and could not help but wander in search of a new path and a spiritual support, and even doubt the enlightenment principles they had recently advocated to society.

In addition to the real reasons, the acceptance of the exchange of historical roles by intellectuals also had deep traditional reasons. Chinese intellectuals, especially the May Fourth generation of intellectuals, although they had begun to come into contact with Western culture, were originally grown in the soil of Eastern culture (mainly traditional Chinese culture). It can be said that they were the regenerated and sedimented products of Eastern culture. When we use ready-made concepts to divide the May Fourth era into two eras, we realize that in real life, it is impossible to create a complete new cultural character in a new era that has just begun, but only to produce some sprouts of new cultural character. And in these sprouts, there are always sediments and inclusions of the heavy, inertia-filled past. This "past force" always tries to pull the new cultural character back to the old starting point, so the intellectuals of the May Fourth era, although they had a very radical attitude towards tradition, in a sense, they were actually split people: their bodies embodied some cultural characters of the new era, but they also stored the cultural genes of the old era; they mastered two cultures, but were also mastered and torn by two cultures; they identified with Western culture in terms of values, but conformed to traditional culture in terms of behavior patterns and ethical attitudes; their hearts were full of conflicts between ideals and reality, individualism and humanism, historicism and ethicism; they shaped the new era while being shaped by the old era, they tried to regulate others with the new cultural spirit, but were also regulated by others with the old cultural spirit. Because their souls were occupied and collided by two incompatible cultures, they appeared particularly distressed and anxious, often swinging between two extremes. This split person and split cultural character naturally lacked a strong subjectivity and individuality, making it difficult to play a strong and firm historical role.

Return: The Establishment of Modern Cultural Value Scale and the Regeneration of Artistic Individuality

The above-mentioned loss of the enlightenment spirit of the May Fourth era and the loss of the subjectivity of intellectuals as enlighteners have gradually returned since the beginning of the new era.

In the past decade, Chinese intellectuals have undergone a significant transformation. The first transformation is that the value position of intellectuals has shifted from being negated by external forces to being affirmed by external forces, that is, from being regarded as an alien force to the working class to becoming a part of the working class. This affirmation is of great significance, meaning that intellectuals have ended their history as objects of transformation and have begun their history as part of the laborers. Recognizing that intellectuals and the working class are in a politically equal position and that intellectuals are part of the working class has created conditions for intellectuals to restore their subjectivity as enlighteners in the modernization process of our country.

Intellectuals who have restored their subjectivity do not try to play the role of saviors, nor do they conduct enlightenment in a non-personal equality position in a pity-the-sky-and-the-people manner. Instead, they reflect on the past history more calmly and rationally, reflect on the reasons for the exchange of historical roles, and let intellectuals and peasants find their reasonable positions. In this reflection, we found that for intellectuals to restore their due historical position, it is important to re-establish the value scale of "modern cultural consciousness." From the late 1920s, Qian Xingcun's high evaluation of peasants and Mao Zedong's later evaluation of peasants and intellectuals, if measured by the "political utilitarian" scale, are not without reason. Mao Zedong said in his speech at the National Propaganda Work Conference in 1957: "Some people are very arrogant. After reading a few sentences, they think they are great, and their tails are raised to the sky. But once they encounter storms, their positions are very different from those of workers and the majority of laboring peasants. The former waver, the latter are firm, the former are ambiguous, the latter are clear." This is generally a fact. But here, the political utilitarian scale is used. According to this scale, it should be admitted that in political struggles, workers and peasants indeed showed more firm will and more thorough positions than intellectuals. Using this scale, which is used in fierce class struggles, to measure intellectuals, it is natural to feel the wavering nature of intellectuals. However, if not using the political utilitarian scale, but using the value scale of "modern cultural consciousness," we will find that this wavering nature precisely reflects a precious modern cultural character of intellectuals, that is, they question everything, maintain a spirit of doubt and rational criticism towards any historical action, and a cultural character of rational criticism. When the political utilitarian value scale completely replaces the modern cultural consciousness scale, this modern spiritual and cultural character of intellectuals becomes an object that must be transformed. The independent thinking spirit of intellectuals was almost completely lost, which is the result of not distinguishing these two value scales.

In fact, the enlightenment theme of the May Fourth era intellectuals was twofold: one was to awaken national consciousness; the other was to awaken modern cultural spirit, to shape modern people and modern cultural character. Politically, it was the former; culturally, it was the latter. The reason why Ah Q became the object of Lu Xun's criticism was that Ah Q was not a modern person and lacked modern cultural consciousness. Therefore, he could not establish himself or others; he could not face his own weaknesses or rationally criticize his tragic environment and his tragic character. Lu Xun's affirmation of Ah Q's revolutionary nature in politics did not hinder him from criticizing Ah Q's absurdity in culture. But we later always covered up Ah Q's absurdity of non-modern consciousness with some revolutionary nature of Ah Q, and condemned intellectuals for this absurdity, which naturally made intellectuals not only give up the initiative to transform this absurdity but also doubt the modern cultural character in themselves. This is precisely the aftereffect of the intensified class struggle era.

After this modern cultural value scale was established, the enlightenment spirit of intellectuals shifted from loss to return. This return was first the return of the self of intellectuals. The subject consciousness of writers was reawakened. Writers discovered that the rational doubt spirit and rational criticism spirit, which were originally criticized as "wavering," were very precious. Thus, they rediscovered themselves, rediscovered the individual spirit, independent consciousness, and concern for the ultimate value of human society that had already burned in themselves in the May Fourth era. Therefore, they were no longer satisfied with being affirmed by external forces but actively affirmed themselves—they defined themselves and were masters of themselves. They realized that their essence was the result of their own choice, not the result of others' definition.

After the return of the self of intellectuals, the enlightenment spirit produced in the May Fourth era began to return. At the beginning of the new era, writers showed an enlightenment spirit. Some new peasant novels re-exposed the huge projection of traditional culture in the hearts of peasants and the distortion of new cultural concepts in the hearts of peasants. It was not a simple singing of the revolutionary nature of peasants, nor a simple exposure of the backwardness of peasants, but a modern cultural perspective to observe the heavy cultural psychological process of contemporary peasants. Thus, they saw the great contrast between the cultural psychology of peasants and the new era spirit, and saw the seriousness of transforming peasants in China. Therefore, in fact, they restored the position of enlighteners. The modernization process of China still needs intellectuals to enlighten peasants with modern consciousness and popularize modern knowledge. Without this enlightenment and popularization, modernization cannot be realized. Without the initiative of intellectuals to engage in this enlightenment and popularization, modernization will be a utopia. And intellectuals can only affirm their value and prove the value of modern culture by linking their destiny with the destiny of modernization, in the cause of popularizing modern knowledge and enlightening modern consciousness, and in the construction of modernization.

With the return of the enlightenment spirit, the creative individuality and artistic style of writers also regained life. The literary creation of our country entered an era of multi-competitive based on individuality.

After intellectuals lost their independent spirit, they produced the disaster of the singularization and conceptualization of literature and art, leading to intellectuals only being able to repeat the thinking of the May Fourth era that had already been criticized, that is, to write "command literature" in the same way, that is, literature that serves politics and provides image annotations for policies. The later "three highlights" concept in the literary and artistic circles pushed the "command literature" to the extreme and deformed position, and finally buried the modern cultural consciousness of personality equality and individualized artistic style. With the return of the self-consciousness of intellectuals, writers finally walked out of this thinking. When old writers recovered their individuality, a large group of young and middle-aged writers were constantly breaking through the existing creation models and walking out of the thinking paths set by others. They had successes and failures, but they were all pursuing something and advocating something, which was to advocate individuality and subjectivity. Although some completely negated the social function of literature (and thus there was no enlightenment of thought), they pursued the independent value of literature and the self-value of individual writers. In this period, the works of writers indeed showed a new appearance.

When we review the 70-year journey of intellectuals in the literary field, we do not want to pursue the responsibility of anyone, but only to look at the past with understanding and sympathy. This understanding and sympathy make us deeply feel that 70 years ago, our motherland began to pursue the goal of modernization, which was indeed a very arduous process. This process proves that without the initiative of intellectuals, modernization is inconceivable. Only by correctly positioning the historical position of intellectuals and peasants, respecting their respective subjectivity and historical initiative, can modernization have hope. At the same time, it also makes us feel that a purely political revolution like the Xinhai Revolution is difficult to succeed, and a purely cultural revolution like the May Fourth era is also difficult to succeed. The modernization steps of our motherland can only have a bright future when they are carried out simultaneously in the fields of politics, economy, and culture. Intellectuals have a place to play, and only in this way can there be a mature Chinese modern literature.

### 两次历史性的突破——从“五四”新文化运动到新时期的“现代文化意识”

　　两次历史性的突破    
    ——从“五四”新文化运动到新时期的“现代文化意识”
    刘再复
    提要：“五四”新文化运动中，中国知识分子在充当历史启蒙者的角色时，一方面启蒙他人，一方面确定自身。“五四”文学精神是对科学、民主、个性解放等现代文化意识的张扬。２０年代以后，由于社会现实的黑暗，民族救亡任务的迫切，社会重心转入政治革命，历史的注意力转移到构成政治运动的主力军农民方面；另一方面，知识分子分裂的文化性格缺乏强大的主体力量和个性，难以担任坚定的历史角色。最近十年，知识分子发生了巨大的转折，价值地位由被外在力量否定的阶段，进入肯定阶段。知识分子现代文化价值尺度确立之后，启蒙精神便从失落转为回归，文学进入一个以个性为基础的多元竞赛的时代。
    在本世纪中，中国知识分子在文学领域中实现了两次历史性的突破：第一次发生在上半世纪。中国知识分子终于摆脱了封建士大夫精神的束缚，开始接受包括科学社会主义学说在内的来自西方的各种张扬民主、科学的人文精神，并完成了以白话文系统代替文言文系统的文体革命，从而翻开了中国新文学的第一页，草创了具有现代意义的新文学的伟大工程。第二次突破发生在最近十年。在这十年中，中国知识分子摆脱了呆板划一的意识形态的限制，打破了单一化的创作模式和理论构架，完成了从一元文学结构向多元文学结构的转变。
    现象：历史角色的互换和启蒙精神的失落
    中国知识分子，作为“五四”新文化运动的主体，他们在运动中担任启蒙者的角色，同时，也担任社会改造者和国民性改造者的角色。他们的启蒙，主要不是知识的传授，而是对于人的内在精神、内在尊严的启迪，是对封建宗法观念的证伪，是对科学、民主、个性解放等现代文化意识的张扬。
    在文学领域中，陈独秀、鲁迅、胡适、周作人等代表人物，揭起文学革命的旗帜，突破传统的文的模式与人的模式，奉行“启蒙主义”，打开了中国现代新文学的第一页。７０年来，他们所张扬的启蒙精神，并不是笔直地发展，它有一个失落与回归的过程。今天，回顾这个过程，不是没有意义的。
    在“五四”新文学运动中，知识分子在充当历史启蒙者的角色时，一方面启蒙他人，一方面确定自身。所谓确定自身，就是确定自己乃是新世纪的自我，是具有现代文化意义的独立人格。这种确定，使他们开始摆脱封建士大夫的文化性格，抛弃“代圣贤立言”的基本思路，而建立起精神主体性的地位。
    “五四”作家和同一时代的知识分子，作为西方人文精神最先的接受者，在各个方面确实发挥了先锋作用。但是，这种先锋地位和启蒙作用，不久就逐步地被淡化、削弱乃至否定，以致发生历史角色的互换，即作为先觉者和启蒙者的知识分子，反而变成被启蒙、被改造的对象，而原来被“哀其不幸”和“怒其不争”的农民则变成改造主体和对知识分子进行“再教育”的主体。在这种历史互换的过程中，知识分子所代表的启蒙精神、自我意识也一步一步地丧失。
    ４０年代之后，类似《阿Ｑ正传》那种用现代人的眼光去看待农民的愚昧、落后的具有强大启蒙力量的作品几乎消声匿迹。代之而起的是赵树理那种讴歌农民革命的作品。试图保持“五四”作品的基本思路，继续让知识分子在生活中维持主体性地位的作品，处境越来越困难了。１９４２年丁玲的小说《在医院中》受到批判就是典型的一例。这一批判是一次重要的转折。它标志着以知识分子为主导地位的文学时代在一个历史阶段上已经终结。之后，不仅《在医院中》这种作品在解放区已经消声匿迹，直接描写知识分子形象的作品也不见了，即使出现几个带知识分子特点的人物，其身份也是干部或下乡干部。例如韦君宜的《三个朋友》，其中的知识分子也已半是干部半是知识分子了，而且思路与“五四”已有质的变化，知识分子开始自我贬抑了。
    解放之后，这种思路在新的社会条件下，成了文学作品中法定的思路。文学作品只能歌颂工农，否则就是丑化劳动人民；只能批判知识分子，否则就是美化知识分子。解放后的文学作品，很少以知识分子为主人公。而在以工农兵为主人公的作品中，知识分子也必然是一个被改造者的形象。在作品中，知识分子的启蒙主体性地位已经完全失落。而这些作品恰恰是出自知识分子之手。知识分子为了证明自己的价值，必须写作，而写出来的东西又必须自我丑化——证明自己无价值才能发表（才能被外在力量确认为价值）。当时的作家就陷入这种悲剧性的怪圈中。
    知识分子所以产生种种异常现象和通过自己的笔否定自我的形象，就因为在他们已经不能不接受在社会中普遍地确立起来的知识分子的观念了。这种观念把知识分子界定于“小资产阶级”的范畴；指出小资产阶级知识分子灵魂深处有一个精神王国，必须加以改造。解放以后，知识分子进一步被界定为资产阶级范畴，而且由于“兴无灭资”口号的提出，对知识分子的改造逐步从号召性质转化为通过政治批判运动加以解决的强制性质，在批判俞平伯、胡风集团、“右派”等政治运动展开之后，知识分子的政治负罪感进一步加强。而在社会的心目中，知识分子也已经失去他们的正面形象，到了“文化大革命”，当“学校被资产阶级知识分子所统治”的论断提出以后，知识分子便成为工人阶级的异己力量了。而随着社会的知识分子观念的巨大逆转，知识分子愈来愈失去自信，愈来愈失去独立的精神与独立的人格，他们不仅“夹着尾巴做人”，而且不断地批判自己，否定自己，奴役自己，践踏自己。在“交心”的名义下，他们掏空了自己的灵魂，而且净化掉“横向”的一切关系，以为人生的意义就在于改造自己，改造得愈彻底，把自己践踏得愈彻底，就愈有安全感，就愈痛快。社会对知识分子的病态认识与知识分子自身的这种病态心理，使知识分子的价值降低到等于零，甚至等于负数——不是人，而是“牛鬼蛇神”。到了此时，连巴金这样的伟大作家也喊出“打倒巴金”的口号。总之，知识分子完全丧失自我存在感和自我确定性，在这种社会与心理的气氛中，作家的“启蒙主义”，早已成为往日的恶梦。
    原因：社会运动重心的转移及现实条件的不足
    “五四”后不久，中国知识分子为什么会不断地否定自我？为什么会丧失启蒙精神并发生和农民互换历史角色的现象呢？
    ２０年代中期，一部分中国知识分子开始放弃自我时，面临着的不是强权的压力，倒是自身的内在要求。那个时代，是一个非常特殊的时代，辛亥革命后，孙中山不再担任总统，袁世凯已经死亡，黎元洪与段祺瑞之间又发生纷争，时代失去权威，相应的是整个国家已经“失控”。在这种中央权力涣散的局面下，使得知识分子具有更多选择的自由，他们本可以把个性发展到极致。但是，当时知识分子却面临着另一种压力，即民族群体的生存困境。“五四”之后，个性的发展要求和民族生存困境的焦虑胶着在一起，使具有强烈爱国主义热情的知识分子处于两难的境地。但是，民族群体的生存困境终于构成最强大的刺激。
    知识分子在“五四”时期处于无可争议的启蒙地位，是与“五四”运动开始时真正的重心是文化革命而不是政治革命分不开的。中国发生“五四”新文化运动首先是辛亥革命失败后的反省的结果。辛亥革命之后出现了袁世凯称帝、张勋复辟和军阀纷争等重大现象。人们寄以巨大希望的辛亥革命除了剪掉一条辫子，中国依然如故，这不能不给知识分子以极大的刺激。他们此时认识到一点，就是拯救民族，光有带救亡性的政治革命不行，还需要带启蒙性的文化革命。因此，“五四”的先驱者便创办《新青年》杂志，从文学入手，发动一场思想革命和文化革命。在启蒙性的文化革命中，掌握文化的知识分子自然是文化革命的主体，而且也自然处于启蒙者的主动地位。
    但是，由于社会现实的极端黑暗，民族救亡任务的极端迫切，这些从事文化革命的知识分子又发现单纯的文化革命不行，因此，社会运动的重心又转入政治革命。“五四”之后出现了中国共产党及其领导下的工农群众运动，“五四”运动、北伐战争，这都是社会运动的重心转向政治革命的标志。而在政治革命中，并不需要复杂的思想启蒙，政治革命使人简单化，政治革命本身就需要简单化。政治革命是大规模的群众运动，它需要简单的鼓动性，需要即刻可以唤起革命烈火的口号，而不是超越性的抽象的启蒙原则。政治革命不需要像文化运动那样复杂，这种特殊的要求自然就削弱知识分子的作用；另一方面，历史的注意力就不能不转移到构成政治运动的主力军方面，而农民正是中国民主革命的主力，于是，历史的主角发生互换便成为可能。
    ２０年代中期政治革命激化之后，一方面是知识分子产生无力感，并否认“五四”的启蒙文学；另一方面在肯定农民的政治作用时，过高地估计农民的文化觉悟。
    反映这种思潮的最典型的文章是钱杏邨的《死去了的阿Ｑ时代》。钱杏邨在这篇文章中说：“现在的农民不是辛亥革命时代的农民，现在的农民的趣味已经从个人的走上政治革命的一条路了！”基于上述见解，钱杏邨宣布：“阿Ｑ时代是早已死去了！阿Ｑ时代是死得已经很遥远了！”（《文学运动史料选》第二册，上海教育出版社，１９７９年版）钱杏邨的文章又是一个重要坐标，它反映了当时一大部分知识分子对农民的基本认识发生了质的变化。
    在这个过程中，３０年代的文艺大众化问题的讨论，更加激烈地批评“五四”的文学运动甚至批评革命文学运动，而且第一次对“五·四”新文学作家作出“小资产阶级作家”的阶级界定，并严厉地批评作家们不“向大众去学习”，反而“教训大众”，鲜明地批评“五四”新文学作家扮演了一个错误的历史角色。３０年代文艺大众化的讨论的结果，是进一步地造成“五四”启蒙精神的失落。但是，应当说明的是，“文艺大众化”的倡导者们，他们认为文艺大众化的主要问题还是语言问题，和利用旧形式的问题（这也是通俗化的问题，脱离群众的问题），而没想到主要问题是立场和思想感情的问题。自然也就没有想到必须对自己的立场和思想感情要来一番彻底的改造。“改造”的命题是４０年代中才正式提出来的。
    但是，上述的政治原因（民族救亡的需要和社会运动重心的转移）仍然无法解释一个现象，即“五四”文学革命退潮后的２０年代中期，作家普遍陷入精神危机的大苦闷现象。当时鲁迅在《坟》的“题记”中就声明自己要把过去的东西“埋在坟里”。这种与过去诀别的情绪带有普遍性，鲁迅曾描述过，当时是有人退伍，有人落荒，有人颓唐，有人叛变。因此，他感到异常寂寞，“两间余一卒，荷戟独徬徨”。当时确实出现一种普遍的苦闷徬徨、重新寻找道路的心境。如果我们在“五四”高潮期看到的是郭沫若式的狂飙式的呼喊和湖畔诗人（应修人、潘漠华等）的天真、热情、充满幻想，那么，到了这个时期，我们见到的则是鲁迅的寂寞与徬徨，是湖畔诗人天真美丽的爱与梦的消失。
    我们要从这一重大现象中提出一个问题，即“五四”新文化运动发生、发展期间（大约从１９１５年到１９２３年），民族的生存困境同样是悲惨的，但在这种环境中为什么作家的心态是那么积极、热情，理直气壮地张扬个性，而到了２０年代中期却产生了普遍性的苦闷？发生在２０年代中期作家的普遍性苦闷是不是还有别的更内在更重要的原因呢？
    在这里，应当肯定地回答，民族群体的生存困境并不是知识分子放弃个性精神和启蒙精神的绝对理由。在民族生存困境中，本来个性也是可以发展的，然而——这里问题的关键是：“五四”运动之后，并没有提供知识分子个性继续生长发展的现实土壤。“五四”运动，作为中国历史的变质点，它标志着中国社会的巨大转型，但是，这一转型并不是十分正常的，它由封建社会直接向现代社会转型时，并没有造成强大的自由职业者的阶层和相应的现代的政治、经济、文化基础。“五四”新文化运动的最后落脚点，完全落到上层建筑之上，即落到为夺取政权，改变政治结构的政治斗争之上。社会革命的任务是包括经济革命在内的，而且要通过夺取政权来改变经济形态，但是，“五四”之后，传统文化赖以生存的小农经济基础依然没有任何改变，自由竞争的商品经济秩序并没有形成，阿Ｑ的故乡未庄，还是小生产者及其小生产自然经济与小生产观念盘踞的未庄。未庄型的经济结构天然地排拒科学民主精神，也天然地排拒个性主义和知识分子的独立精神。
    从社会意识的形成来说，没有相应的物的关系，就不可能有强大的个性，不可能有强大的知识分子的独立性。我国新的知识分子的现代心灵正是缺乏一个充分发育成长的土壤，缺少自然壮大的过程。因此，它是很脆弱的。我国现代知识分子之所以在“五四”时站立出来，并形成一种文学的思想的力量，主要是依靠西方的文化思潮。但由于缺少强大的经济基础、文化基础和群体的基础，他们很快就发现自己陷入时代性的文化大隔膜中，他们的启蒙思想和充满个性的歌唱找不到知音，他们的爱与呼唤，在阿Ｑ一类的小生产心壁上回响之后总是发生变形和变调，于是，他们孤独、彷徨、寂寞。这就不能不陷入绝望。现代心灵、现代个性的发育过程，在西方，是一个漫长的、缓慢的过程，是几个世纪的自然生长、发展的过程，它的生长得到政治的、经济的、文化的、思想等各种外在条件的配合。而我们“五四”新文学运动则发展得异常迅猛，个性主义，知识分子的独立精神突然迸发，它没有相应的外在条件。因此，新文学作家就很容易产生伤感，容易幻灭，就不能不带着彷徨之情重新寻找道路、寻找精神的支点，甚至怀疑起自己在不久以前向社会宣扬的那些启蒙的原则。
    除了现实的原因之外，知识分子接受历史角色的互换还有很深远的传统原因。中国知识分子，特别是“五四”这一代知识分子，尽管已开始接触了西方文化，但它原本是在东方文化（主要是中华传统文化）的土壤中生长起来的。可以说，他们是东方文化的再生物和积淀物。当我们用现成的概念把“五四”前后划分为两个时代时，我们认识到，在现实生活中，不可能在一个新的刚刚开始的时代里就创造出一种完整意义的新的文化性格，而只能产生新的文化性格的某些萌芽。而在这种萌芽中又总是积淀和包含着沉重的、充满惰性力的过去。这种“过去的力量”总是想竭力把新的文化性格拉回到旧的基点上去，因此，“五四”时代的知识分子，尽管他们对传统的态度相当激烈，但在某种意义上，他们其实都是分裂的人：他们的身上既体现某种新时代的文化性格，又积存着旧时代的文化基因；他们掌握着两种文化，同时又被两种文化掌握着和撕裂着；他们在价值观念上与西方文化认同，但在行为模式与伦理态度上又就范传统文化；他们的内心充满着理想和现实的矛盾，个人主义与人道主义的矛盾，历史主义与伦理主义的矛盾；他们既塑造着新的时代，又同时被旧的时代所塑造，他们企图用新的文化精神去规范别人，又同时被别人用旧的文化精神所规范。由于他们的灵魂中被两种互不相容的文化所占据，所撞击，因此，他们显得格外苦闷、焦虑，常常在两个极端上摇摆。这种分裂的人和分裂的文化性格，自然就缺乏强大的主体力量和个性力量，就很难担任强大的、坚定的历史角色。
    回归：现代文化价值尺度的确立与艺术个性的再生
    上述种种“五四”启蒙精神的失落以及知识分子启蒙者主体性地位的失落现象，直到进入新时期以来才逐步得到回归。
    在最近十年中，中国知识分子发生了巨大的转折。第一个转折是知识分子价值地位由被外在力量所否定的阶段，进入被外在力量所肯定的阶段，即从被视为工人阶级的异己力量转变为工人阶级的一部分。这一肯定的意义十分重大，意味着知识分子已经结束作为被改造对象的历史，而开始了作为劳动者的一部分的历史。确认知识分子与工人阶级处于政治平等的地位，并确认知识分子是工人阶级的一部分，就为知识分子在我国现代化过程中恢复启蒙者的主体性地位创造了条件。
    恢复主体性地位的知识分子并不试图去充当救世主的角色，也不是在非人格平等的地位上去进行悲天悯人式的启蒙，而是更加冷静，更加理性地反省过去的历史，反省历史角色互换的原因，让知识分子和工农各自找到自己合理的位置。在反省中，我们发现，知识分子要恢复应有的历史地位，重要的是应当重新确立“现代文化意识”这一价值尺度。从２０年代后期，钱杏邨对农民的高度评价和后来毛泽东对农民以及对知识分子的评价，如果从“政治功利”尺度来“衡量”，并不是没有道理的。毛泽东在１９５７年全国宣传工作会议上的讲话中说：“有一些人很骄傲，读了几句书，自以为了不起，尾巴翘到天上去了，可是一遇风浪，他们的立场，比起工人和大多数劳动农民来，就显得大不相同。前者动摇，后者坚定，前者暧昧，后者明朗。”这大体上是一个事实。但这里使用的是政治功利尺度。按照这一尺度，应当承认，在政治斗争中，工人农民确实表现出比知识分子更坚定的意志，更彻底的立场。用这种在激烈的阶级斗争中使用的尺度来衡量知识分子，自然会感到知识分子的摇摆性。然而，如果不是用政治功利尺度，而是使用“现代文化意识”的价值尺度，我们就会发现，这种摇摆性恰恰地反映出知识分子身上一种可贵的现代文化品格，即他们凡事都要问一个为什么，对任何历史行动都要保持一种怀疑精神，和理性批判精神的文化品格。当政治功利价值尺度完全取代现代文化意识尺度的时候，知识分子这种具有现代意义的精神和品格便成为必须改造的对象。知识分子的独立思考精神最后几乎完全丧失，就是没有区分这两种价值尺度的结果。
    事实上，“五四”时代知识分子的启蒙主题，一是启发民族主义的觉悟；二是在于启发现代文化精神，以塑造现代人和现代文化性格。从政治上说是前者，从文化上说是后一种。阿Ｑ所以成为鲁迅批判的对象，关键就在于阿Ｑ不是现代人，没有现代的文化意识，因此，他既不能确立自我，也不能确立他人；既不能正视自己的弱点，也不能对自己所处的悲剧性环境和自己的悲剧性性格进行理性批判。鲁迅在政治上肯定阿Ｑ的革命性并不妨碍他从文化上批判阿Ｑ的荒诞性。而我们后来却总是以阿Ｑ的某种革命性来掩盖阿Ｑ身上非现代意识的荒诞性，并对知识分子鞭鞑这种荒诞性加以谴责，这自然使知识分子不仅放弃对这种荒诞性进行改造的积极性，而且进而怀疑自己身上的现代文化品格。这正是阶级斗争激化年代留下的后遗症。
    这种现代文化价值尺度确立之后，知识分子的启蒙精神便从失落转为回归。这种回归首先是知识分子自我的回归。作家的主体意识重新觉醒。作家们发现，原来被指责为“摇摆性”的理性怀疑精神和理性批判精神是十分宝贵的。于是，他们重新发现自己，重新发现自己身上那些在“五四”时代就已经燃烧起来的个性精神、独立意识和对人类社会终极价值的关怀精神。因此，他们再也不满足被外在力量所肯定，而积极地进行自我肯定——自己确定自己，自己做自己的主人。他们意识到，自己的本质是自己选择的结果，而不是他人规定的结果。
    知识分子的自我回归之后，相应地，“五四”时代产生的那种启蒙精神也开始回归。新时期文学一开始，作家就表现出一种启蒙精神。一些新的农民小说，重新揭示传统文化在农民心灵中的巨大投影和新文化观念在农民心灵的变形。它不是简单地讴歌农民的革命性，也不是简单地暴露农民的落后性，而是用现代的文化眼光来透视当代农民的沉重的文化心理历程。从而看到农民文化心理与新时代文化精神的巨大反差，从而看到中国改造农民的严重性，于是，在实际上，他们又恢复了一个启蒙者的地位。中国的现代化过程还需要知识分子去对农民进行现代意识的思想启蒙和现代知识的普及。离开这种启蒙和普及，现代化是不可能实现的，离开知识分子从事这种启蒙与普及的积极性，现代化将是一种乌托邦。而知识分子也只有把自己的命运和现代化的命运联系在一起，在普及现代知识和启蒙现代意识的事业中，在现代化的建设中，才能肯定自我的价值和证明现代文化的价值。
    随着启蒙精神的回归，作家的创作个性和艺术风格也获得再生。我国的文学创作又进入以个性为基础的多元竞赛的时代。
    知识分子丧失独立精神之后，便产生了文学艺术的单一化和概念化的灾难，并导致知识分子只能重复“五四”时代早已批判过的“代圣贤立言”的思路去作千篇一律的“遵命文学”，即为政治服务和为政策作形象注释的文学。后来在文艺界提出的“三突出”的观念，把“代圣贤立言”的遵命文学推到极端的畸形的位置上，最后埋葬了人格平等等现代文化意识和个性化的艺术风格。随着知识分子自我意识的回归，作家终于从这种思路中走出来。在老作家恢复个性之时，大群中青年作家也在不断地超越已有的创作模式，从他人设定的思路上走出来。他们有的成功，有的失败，但都在追求一种东西，张扬一种东西，这就是张扬个性，张扬主体性。尽管有的完全否定文学的社会功能（也就无所谓思想启蒙了），但他们所追求的还是文学的独立价值和作家个人的自我价值。这个时期，作家的作品确实展开新的风貌。
    当我们回顾文学领域中知识分子所走过的七十年的道路时，我们不愿意去追究任何人的责任，而只是用理解和同情的眼光去看待过去。这种理解与同情，使我们更深切地体会到，七十年前我们的祖国开始追求的现代化目标，确实是一个很艰辛的过程，这个过程证明，离开知识分子的积极性，现代化是不可思议的。只有摆正知识分子和工农的历史位置，尊重他们各自的主体性和历史主动性，现代化才有希望。同时，也使我们体会到，像辛亥革命那样单纯的政治革命难以成功，像“五四”那样单纯的文化革命也难以成功，我们祖国的现代化步伐只有在政治、经济、文化等各个领域同时进行才能有光辉的前途，知识分子才有用武之地，也只有这样，才有成熟的中国现代文学。
