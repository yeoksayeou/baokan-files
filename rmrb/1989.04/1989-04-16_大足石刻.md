Dazhu County in Sichuan Province is adjacent to the ancient Changzhou and Yongchuan. The Baoding and Beishan rock carvings are famous worldwide. There are thousands of reclining Buddha statues and figures carved from folk legends.

From Yongchuan to Dazhu
Retracing a long journey
The car moves like a gecko on a steep cliff
With the "dry people" of Bashan
In the mist of history, they sway and float
(I recognize them as the descendants of the Red Army)
Women with large breasts nurse their children with open chests
Yellow and barren lands nurture tender lives
For a long-cherished wish
They go: to worship the Buddha
A thousand-year-old giant Buddha hides his legs in
Purple rock layers and dark green vegetation
Lying on his side, he indulges in the piety of the worshippers
Why don't you stand up
With just a pair of big feet
You can't walk out of the threshold
That the faithful have built for you
The faithful can't walk out of
Your cracked palm lines

　　大足石刻
　　刘斌夫
    四川省大足县毗邻古昌州永川，宝鼎、北山石刻驰名中外。计有卧佛及取材于民间传说故事的摩崖造像数千尊。
    从永川到大足
    回溯一个久远的历程
    车如壁虎在陡崖上爬行
    和巴山的“干人”们
    在历史的浪雾中颠簸沉浮
    （我认出他们是红军的子孙）
    乳房硕大的女人敞胸奶着孩子
    苍黄和瘠贫哺育出娇嫩的生灵
    为着一个宿愿
    他们去：拜佛
    千年巨佛把双腿裹藏在
    紫色的岩层和暗绿的植被里
    侧卧着恣意玩味祈祷者的虔诚
    你怎不站起来
    徒有一双大足
    你走不出善男信女
    为你修造的门槛
    善男信女走不出
    你龟裂的掌纹
