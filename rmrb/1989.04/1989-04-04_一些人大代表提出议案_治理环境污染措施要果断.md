Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 3rd.

Some representatives attending the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress have submitted proposals, urging the state to take decisive and effective measures to address environmental governance and protection.

The Jiangsu delegation, including 33 representatives led by Qu Qinyue, stated: With the rapid economic development, environmental pollution has become a prominent issue in China. Water pollution is particularly severe, and by the end of this century, 70% of freshwater resources will be contaminated. The rapid development of township enterprises has led to self-pollution of the rural environment. Natural resources are being exploited and misused, leading to or potentially causing serious ecological degradation.

The Shanghai delegation, including 30 representatives led by Zhang Zhili, pointed out that the Environmental Protection Law and the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Law have not been effectively implemented. They suggested the following measures:

1. The establishment or expansion of factories, especially township enterprises, should undergo thorough investigations into energy consumption and environmental impacts. Relevant departments should review and approve these projects based on national legislation before construction begins.
2. Further improvement of environmental regulations. Currently, regulations regarding energy consumption structure, especially in large cities, and specific emission standards for pollutants are too general and need to be refined and improved.
3. Energy development projects must have scientific assessment reports. Projects that significantly impact the national economy or involve major social issues should be submitted to the National People's Congress and the State Council for review.

　　一些人大代表提出议案
    治理环境污染措施要果断
    据新华社北京四月三日电  出席七届全国人大二次会议的一些代表，提出议案，要求国家采取果断有力的措施，进行环境的治理与保护。
    江苏代表团的曲钦岳等三十三名代表提出：随着经济高速度地发展，环境污染已成为我国的突出问题。水污染十分严重，到本世纪末，百分之七十的淡水资源将遭受污染；乡镇工业的迅速发展已造成对农村环境的自身污染；自然资源被掠夺性开发、滥用，已经发生或潜伏着生态环境恶化的严重危机。
    上海代表团的张仲礼等三十名代表提出，环境保护法、大气污染防治法未能得到很好贯彻执行。他们建议：一、兴建工厂，特别是乡镇企业的建立或扩大，应对耗能数量和对周围环境进行充分调查，作出有关保护环境的措施，由有关部门根据国家立法审查批准后施工。二、进一步完善环保法规。目前，对能源消费结构，特别是大城市中的能源消费结构，以及污染物排放量的具体数字标准等，规定比较原则，有待完善和改进。三、能源发展项目必须有科学的评估报告。一些关系到国民经济全局或涉及重大社会问题的能源发展项目，提交全国人大和国务院审查。
