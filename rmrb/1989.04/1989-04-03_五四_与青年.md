The May Fourth Movement, which took place seventy years ago, was the greatest thought liberation movement in modern Chinese history. It promoted the spread of Marxism in China and led to the founding of the Communist Party of China. However, we refer to it as a youth movement and designate May 4th as "Youth Day." What does this signify?

Historically, whether it was the patriotic and salvational movement on May 4, 1919, or the cultural enlightenment wave before it, both were led by young intellectuals. In other words, the great achievements of the May Fourth Movement primarily belong to that generation of youth. Moreover, even after the May Fourth Movement, as China gradually embarked on the path of socialism, it was primarily due to the efforts of young intellectuals. Mao Zedong said, "Since the May Fourth Movement, the youth of China have played a certain vanguard role." He also said, "In the democratic revolutionary movement in China, intellectuals were the first to become aware" (as seen in "The May Fourth Movement" and "The Direction of the Youth Movement").

When Chen Duxiu started the "New Youth" magazine, he was 35 years old. When Li Dazhao participated in leading the May Fourth Movement, he was 30 years old. When the Communist Party of China was founded, Mao Zedong was 28 years old, Li Da was 31 years old, and when the Nanchang Uprising took place, Zhou Enlai was 29 years old. Extending this, the "Communist Manifesto" was published when Marx was 30 years old and Engels was 28 years old. Lenin organized the Marxist group when he was only 20 years old, and he started the "Iskra" newspaper when he was 30 years old. These examples show that not only in China and Russia, but also globally, the socialist movement was initiated and spread by the youth.

Marxism and socialism were initially started by the youth and were a cause that attracted many young people, full of youthful vigor. So, one hundred years later, seventy years later, forty years later, what is the relationship between contemporary Marxism and socialism with the youth? Do the youth still possess the vanguard and pioneering value in it?

Undoubtedly, in any era, the unique value of youth is irreplaceable. The question is whether they can fully manifest it. History has repeatedly proven that any cause closely related to the youth will inevitably flourish like the vitality of young people, unstoppable; any cause that does not need the youth or even opposes the youth will inevitably decline, powerless. The same applies to a nation. Li Dazhao once said: "The formation of a nation and a state by humanity also has its life. There are nations in their youth, and there are nations in their old age... The aged China is the embryo of youthful China. The youthful China is the rejuvenation of aged China. The aged China is the declining China. The youthful China is the flourishing China" ("Youth").

Today's reform and opening up are closely related to the youth of the contemporary era. Although there are many difficulties and obstacles, in the long run, it will definitely flourish. The youth of the Chinese nation is tied to this cause.

The value of youth, which cannot be despised or defeated, does not lie in the natural law of youth eventually replacing the elderly, but in the fact that only youth possesses many precious spirits in the river of life that cannot be regained. Only during youth does one exhibit the vigorous vitality of life. In his essay "A Message to Youth," Chen Duxiu summarized six characteristics of youth: "Independent and not servile, progressive and not conservative, enterprising and not retreating, global and not isolationist, practical and not superficial, scientific and not imaginative." These words are not exaggerated.

Youth is an eternal word, but for individuals, it is fleeting; everyone must transition from youth to old age, leaving only memories of youth. Youth also has a changing essence; the youth of the previous generation is the old age of this generation, and the youth of this generation will be the old age of the next generation; the innovative achievements of the previous generation full of youthful vigor become historical relics for this generation; the radical speeches of this generation will become commonplace for the next generation. Therefore, youth, along with its precious spirit, will not permanently belong to anyone. After we pass through our youthful years, we should not be intoxicated by the past glory; instead, we should face the new generation of youth and value the youthful qualities they possess. The youth of the past is no longer youth today, the progress of the past is no longer progress today, and the innovation of the past is no longer innovation today. Only in this way can youth always have an enchanting charm, progress can be continuously achieved, innovation can always be a motivating cause, and human society will not stagnate.

Of course, youth has its weaknesses: lack of experience, tendency to be radical, and not considering things thoroughly... Fortunately, youth still has the opportunity to gradually eliminate these weaknesses: they have time, and one day they will have the opportunity to point out the aforementioned weaknesses of the next generation of youth. However, the weaknesses of the elderly are not easily overcome, which is quite unfair. Of course, wise elders will use youth to compensate for their own weaknesses, just as intelligent youth will seize the necessary wisdom and experience from the elderly before they grow old.

The weaknesses of youth are not absolute weaknesses; they are linked to their strengths. Similarly, the weaknesses and strengths of the elderly are complementary. Just as the elderly are generally the stabilizing factor in society, youth generally imparts vitality to society. During the May Fourth period, Chen Duxiu pointed out: "Youth in society is like the fresh and lively cells in the body. The body follows the law of metabolism and remains healthy; if decayed and rotting cells fill the body, the body dies; society follows the law of metabolism and prospers; if decayed and rotting elements fill society, society perishes." The value of youth is precious, but it cannot be fully realized under any conditions. The primary condition is that youth must be self-aware, "Self-awareness? Self-awareness of one's fresh and lively value and responsibility, and self-respect." From ancient times, "I consider youthful maturity a Chinese saying about people." Today, youthful maturity is not entirely a virtue, but aging without decline should be highly praised, because we are precisely in an era of revitalizing national youth.

Society values youth, which can invigorate the spirit of the nation. And valuing youth primarily means respecting the pioneering spirit of youth, because as Mao Zedong said, only youth has the least conservative thoughts and the most pioneering spirit. And respecting the pioneering spirit of youth primarily means respecting the pioneering spirit of youth in thought and knowledge, because only this is something of universal and far-reaching significance. The global pioneering of Marxism in the past was a pioneering of thought; the pioneering of the May Fourth Movement in China was also a pioneering of thought; today's pioneering cause of reform and opening up is also a result of thought liberation and seeking truth from facts. China's modernization must continue to advance, and it still needs a more profound and extensive pioneering of thought, which is beyond doubt; and this pioneering cannot do without youth, which is also beyond doubt.

Youth demands that society respect them, but first, they must respect themselves; asking others to cherish their value is not as good as consciously striving to create their own value; the cause of youth can only be pioneered by youth themselves, as it has always been. History has never bestowed favors on those who make sincere requests, but it loves those who bravely and stubbornly pioneer. Marx proved this, the May Fourth youth proved this, and the Chinese Communists also proved this.

The initiation of the May Fourth New Culture Movement and the founding of the Chinese socialist cause were both pioneering causes of a generation of youth. Today, the construction of modern new culture and the socialist reform and opening-up cause must become a flourishing and unstoppable cause. Is it not that this must be, and will be, a pioneering great cause that can only be realized by one or even several generations of Chinese youth? Have the elderly, middle-aged, and youth all clearly realized this?

Despite the successive generations of youth, the value of youth is always precious and irreplaceable. Despite any cause becoming a historical relic, only the cause represented by youth will always belong to the future. Any cause can only win itself by winning the youth, and any nation can only invigorate itself by invigorating the youth. Let us once again sincerely remind our arduous cause and our ancient nation!

　　“五四”与青年
　　远志明
    七十年前的五四运动是中国近代以来最伟大的思想解放运动，它促进了马克思主义在中国的传播，促成了中国共产党的诞生。然而，我们却称之为青年运动，定名为“青年节”。这意味着什么呢？
    从史实来看，无论是１９１９年５月４日这一天的爱国救亡运动，还是在此之前的文化启蒙浪潮，都是以青年知识分子为其先导的；也就是说，“五四”的伟大功绩首先是属于那一代青年的。不仅如此，即使“五四”之后中国逐步走上社会主义道路，也应当首先归功于青年知识分子。毛泽东说，“五四”以来，中国的青年们起了某种先锋队的作用。又说，在中国的民主革命运动中，知识分子是首先觉悟的成份（见《五四运动》和《青年运动的方向》）。
    陈独秀创办《新青年》时３５岁，李大钊参与领导五四运动时３０岁，中国共产党诞生时，毛泽东２８岁，李达３１岁，南昌起义时周恩来２９岁。推而广之，《共产党宣言》发表时，马克思３０岁，恩格斯２８岁。列宁组织马克思主义小组时年仅２０岁，创办《火星报》时３０岁。如此等等，都可表明，不仅中国、俄国，甚至世界范围内的社会主义运动，都是由青年发起和传播的。
    马克思主义和社会主义当初是青年人开创的，是吸引广大青年、充满青春活力的事业。那么，一百年后，七十年后，四十年后，当代马克思主义和社会主义与青年的关系如何呢？青年们在其中是否仍然具有先锋性和开创性的价值呢？
    无疑，在任何时代，青年的独特价值都是不可替代的。问题只是他们能否充分表现出来。历史一再证明，凡是与青年息息相通的事业，必定会像青年人的生命力一样，蒸蒸日上，势不可遏；凡是无需青年作为、甚至招致青年作对的事业，必定每况愈下，力所不支。一个民族也如此。李大钊当年曾说：“人类之成一民族一国家者，亦各有其生命焉。有青春之民族，斯有白首之民族……白首中华者，青春中华本以胚孕之实也。青春中华者，白首中华托以再生之华也。白首中华者，渐即废落之中华也。青春中华者，方复开敷之中华也”（《青春》）。
    今日改革开放，便是与当代青年息息相通的事业。眼前看来，尽管困难重重，步履维艰，从长计议，必定蒸蒸日上。中华民族的青春，正系于此项事业之中。
    青年人不可蔑视和不可战胜之价值，并不在于青年终究要代替老年的自然淘汰法则，而在于唯有青年身上具有人生长河中许多不可复得的宝贵精神，唯有青年时期，展现着人的生命中那种勃勃的青春活力。陈独秀在《敬告青年》一文中，概括了青年的六个特征：“自主的而非奴隶的，进步的而非保守的，进取的而非退隐的，世界的而非锁国的，实利的而非虚文的，科学的而非想象的”，此语并非言过其实。
    青年，是一个永恒的字眼，但对于人来说却是短暂的；每个人都要从青年走向老年，只留下青春的回忆。青年，又具有变动的内含，上一代的青年是这一代的老年，这一代的青年也是下一代的老年；上一代充满青春活力的创举，这一代却成了历史的陈迹；这一代听来刺耳的言论，下一代会成为老生常谈。所以，青春，连同它的宝贵精神，是不会永久属于任何人的。当我们走过了青春年华之后，不应再为昔日的光彩而陶醉；而应当面向新一代青年，重视他们身上具有的青春价值。昔日的青春今日已不再是青春，昔日的前进今日已不再是前进，昔日的开创今日已不再是开创。唯此，青春才永远有迷人的风采，进步才能不断达成，开创才永远是激励人心的事业，人类社会才不会停止不前。
    当然，青年人有青年人的弱点：缺乏经验，容易激进，虑事不周……好在青年人还有机会逐步消除这些弱点：他们拥有时间，而且终有一天还会有机会指出下一代青年的上述弱点。然而，老年人的某些弱点却是没有更多机会克服的，这一点，说来太不公平。当然，明智的老人会借助青年来弥补自身的弱点，正像聪慧的青年会不等自己白了头，就从老人那里攫取了必要的智慧和经验一样。
    青年人的弱点并非绝对的弱点，它是与其优点相联系的。同样，老年人的弱点与优点也是相辅相成的。正像老年人一般是社会的致稳因素一样，青年人一般会赋予社会以活力。五四时期，陈独秀曾精辟地点明：“青年之于社会，犹新鲜活泼细胞之于人身。人身遵新陈代谢之道则健康，陈腐朽败之细胞充塞人身则人身死；社会遵新陈代谢之道则隆盛，陈腐朽败之分子充塞社会则社会亡”。青年的价值是宝贵的，但并非任何条件下都能得以发挥。条件之首，是青年人自身应当自觉，“自觉者何？自觉其新鲜活泼之价值与责任，而自视不可卑也”。自古以来，“窃以少年老成，中国称人之语也”。于今说来，少年老成并非全是益事美德，年长而勿衰，倒是该极力赞扬的，因为我们恰正处在焕发民族青春的时代。
    社会重视青年，才能焕发出青年的活力，进而振奋民族的精神。而重视青年，首要的是尊重青年的开创性，因为正如毛泽东所说，唯有青年最少保守思想，最有开创精神。而尊重青年的开创性，首要的是尊重青年思想和知识上的开创性，因为唯有这才是具有普遍和深远意义的东西。当年马克思主义的世界性开创，是思想的开创；“五四”在中国的开创性，也是思想观念的开创；今日改革开放的开创性事业，也是思想解放、实事求是的结果。中国的现代化事业要继续前进，还需要更深刻更广泛的思想开创，这是毫无疑义的；而这种开创，离不开青年，这也是毫无疑义的。
    青年要求社会尊重自己，首先要自己尊重自己；请求别人珍视自己的价值，不如自觉奋斗创造自己的价值；青年的事业只有靠青年人自己开创，历来如此。历史从来不恩赐那些虔诚的请求者，而偏爱那些勇敢执拗的开创者。马克思证明了这一点，“五四”青年们证明了这一点，中国共产党人也证明了这一点。
    “五四”新文化运动的发起和中国社会主义事业的发韧，都曾是一代青年的开创性事业。今天，现代新文化的建设和社会主义的改革开放事业要成为蒸蒸日上、势不可遏的事业，不是仍然应当是、而且必定是一代乃至几代中国青年们才能实现的开创性伟业吗？对于这一点，老年、中年和青年们是否都已经清醒地意识到了呢？
    尽管青年人一代又一代的交替，青年的价值永远是宝贵的、不可替代的。尽管任何一桩事业都会成为历史的陈迹，但唯有青年所代表的事业永远属于未来。任何一项事业只有赢得了青年才能赢得自身，任何一个民族只有振奋了青年才能振奋自身，让我们再一次这样诚恳地告诫我们艰难的事业和我们古老的民族吧！
