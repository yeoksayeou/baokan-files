The Chuzhou City Scrap Metal Company, affiliated with the Supply and Marketing Cooperative, recently purchased two large excavator trailers, which were in good condition with about 50-60% of their useful life remaining, as scrap steel.

On March 9th, two young men visited the Chuzhou City Scrap Metal Recovery Company, specifically the metal sales department managed by Na Sunzhong. They stated, "We are part of a private construction team and plan to sell two excavator trailers to buy a small car for taxi services. We wonder if you are interested in purchasing them?" Na, the manager, saw this as a profitable deal, estimating a profit of at least 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, and agreed to purchase them at the price of first-grade scrap steel, 400 yuan per ton. The two trailers, excluding the tires, weighed 13 tons, and including the four tires, the total payment was 5,400 yuan. Subsequently, Na Sunzhong priced the large excavator trailers at 10,000 yuan for resale.

In late March, the owners of a collective enterprise, actually a private enterprise, from Qian Shan Hong Farm Machinery Team in Yuanjiang City, Hunan Province, and a villager from Ai Jia Village, Lianzi Tank Township, reported to the South District Public Security Bureau of Chuzhou City that two large excavator trailers stored in a warehouse in the suburban area of Chuzhou had been stolen. The South District Public Security Bureau investigated and found that the two excavator trailers purchased by the Chuzhou City Scrap Metal Recovery Company on March 10th were indeed the ones reported stolen by Tian and Hu. The two young men who sold the trailers, Xu Jun and Li Zhiyi, confessed to the theft.

The Chuzhou City Scrap Metal Company becoming a haven for stolen goods has sparked dissatisfaction among various sectors of society. According to materials provided by the South District Public Security Bureau of Chuzhou City, the South China Power Machinery Company spent hundreds of millions of yuan to develop a new type of aircraft component and produced a limited number of samples. Later, these samples were stolen by children, each worth over 200,000 yuan. The children sold the stolen components after smashing or breaking them, and the scrap collection department purchased them without questioning their origin. Last year, someone stole entire aluminum ingots and sold them as scrap, and the scrap collection department accepted them without hesitation.

Wise individuals are calling for the rectification of the scrap material collection industry. Recently, the South District Public Security Bureau of Chuzhou City conducted a cleanup and rectification of the scrap material collection industry within its jurisdiction, discovering that out of 45 scrap material collection stations, 18 were illegally collecting copper, steel, and industrial materials. During the rectification, over 2,000 kilograms of illegally collected copper, steel, and industrial materials, as well as three bicycles, were seized.

　　株洲市废旧物资公司某些人钱迷心窍    
    将被盗的大型铲运机拖斗作废钢收购     
    有识之士呼吁：整顿废旧物品收购行业
    本报讯  记者吴兴华报道：湖南省株洲市近日爆出一条新闻：株洲市废旧物资回收公司以废钢铁价收购了来路有问题的两台尚有五六成新的大型铲运机拖斗。
    三月九日，两个青年人来到株洲市供销社联社所属的株洲市废旧物资回收公司，找到该公司金属经营部经理孙正功，说：“我们是个体基建队的，准备将两台铲运机拖斗卖掉，买台小汽车，经营出租汽车。不知你们收不收？”孙经理对这笔生意很有兴趣，说：“你们拖来看看吧。”第二天，这两个青年叫了株洲市第一汽车运输公司的两部货车，将轮胎约有一人高的两台大型铲运机拖斗拖到市废旧物资回收公司门外的马路上，请孙经理看货。孙经理认为这是一笔好买卖，至少可赚上一两万元钱，便拍板说，按一级废钢收购，四百元一吨。两台拖斗，除去轮胎，净重十三吨多，连四个轮胎，共付了五千四百元。随后，孙正功将这大型铲运机拖斗标价一万元出售。
    三月下旬，名为集体企业、实为私人企业的湖南省沅江市千山红农场机械队的主人田耀湘和沅江市莲子塘乡艾家村十二组的村民胡玉泉，到株洲市公安局南区公安分局报案：他们两人寄存在市郊区早禾坪市药材公司仓库内的两台大型铲运机拖斗被盗。经南区公安分局查明：市废旧物资回收公司三月十日收购的两台铲运机拖斗，就是田、胡两人丢失的。卖拖斗的两个年青人，一个叫徐军，一个叫李志其。二人对此偷盗行为供认不讳。
    株洲市废旧物资公司成为盗窃分子的销赃场所，引起社会各界的不满。据株洲市南区公安分局的同志提供的材料表明，该市的南方动力机械公司花了数百万元，试制出一种新型号的飞机零件，并加工出为数很少的样品。后来，这样品被小孩偷走了几个，每个价值二十多万元。小孩将偷去的零件锤碎或锤破出卖，废旧收购部门不问来历，将其收购。去年，有人偷了整块的铝锭拿来作废品卖，废旧收购部门也照收不误。
    有识之士呼吁：对废旧物资收购行业必须整顿。最近，株洲市南区公安分局对其辖区内的废旧行业进行了一次清理、整顿，发现在该辖区内，废旧物资收购站共四十五户，其中违法违章收购的铜、钢材和工业用材的有十八户。在整顿中，共没收违法违章收购废旧铜、钢材和工业用材达两千多公斤，自行车三辆。
