Dongying and other areas along the Bohai Sea coast in Shandong Province, such as several cities and counties, face difficulties in accessing fresh water due to shallow saline groundwater. Currently, these regions are conducting successful scientific experiments on "roof water collection." They utilize the roofs of tile houses, jar tile houses, or cement mortar-finished houses to collect natural rainfall. This water is then channeled through pipelines, sedimentation tanks, and filtration tanks into water reservoirs. After disinfection, it is supplied for human and animal consumption. The water has been certified to meet national standards for living water. This method requires minimal investment and has a high water source guarantee rate.

　　东营等地推广——“屋顶接水”
    本报讯  山东渤海沿岸东营市等几个市、县浅层地下为咸水，人、畜饮水困难。目前，这些地区进行“屋顶接水”科研试验，获得成功。他们利用土瓦房、缸瓦房或水泥砂浆抹面的房顶接汇天然降水，通过输水管道、沉淀池、过滤池流入水仓，消毒后供人、畜饮用，经鉴定达到国家规定的生活用水标准。这种做法投资少、水源保证率较高。
