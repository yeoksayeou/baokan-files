In the autumn of 1987, the Wuxi Municipal Government decided to renovate the Wuxi Railway Station, which had been built over 80 years ago and had become a dilapidated building. According to the design, completing this project, which is second only to the Shanghai Railway Station in scale and capacity, would require 645 days. Before the Spring Festival of 1988, large-scale demolition work was completed, and the project was ready to commence. At this time, the Shanghai Railway Bureau and the Wuxi Municipal Government required that the project be completed and put into operation before the Spring Festival of 1989 to adapt to the development of the coastal economy. This meant that the project had to be completed in 300 days.

The Wuxi Construction Engineering Company, a company known for its advanced ideological and political work and a seasoned construction force, decided to undertake this project.

The biggest challenge was not the tight schedule or the heavy workload, but how to find a way to mobilize people's enthusiasm. The economic incentive of "more work, more pay" is effective, but when young workers see street vendors making big money below the scaffolding, they realize there are more profitable ways to earn money. Relying solely on money is not enough to ensure that workers maintain sustained enthusiasm.

The company's Party Committee decided: to use both methods! To closely combine ideological and political work with economic incentives.

During the construction, the company dispatched its strongest construction team to the site and adopted a subcontracting method to organize 23 sister units to work together. On the construction site, four management networks were established: production command, quality control, safety production, and security. The responsibility system was fully implemented at all levels. At the same time, a series of measures to strengthen ideological and political work were promptly implemented. A temporary party branch was quickly established on the construction site, with leaders from more than 20 units present. A group of party members, young pioneers, and advanced teams took up the most arduous positions. The company's propaganda team also went to the front line, publishing quick reports, printing special editions, and timely commending advanced examples in the construction process. From the construction team to the work team, specific personnel were assigned to handle ideological and political work. The workers were encouraged to establish the value of "contributing to the Four Modernizations" and to recognize the significance of using their own hands to build a high-standard gateway for Wuxi, an important economic and tourist city on the coast.

In the construction process, the exemplary actions of the leaders and party members became the most effective ideological and political work. The project commander, Shen Qing-song, the director of the Wuxi Construction Commission, moved his bed to the construction site from the first day of construction, working alongside the workers, and did not return home even during the Mid-Autumn Festival and the New Year. Deputy commander Dong Wei suffered from asthma, with blood in his sputum, and after each infusion, he rushed back to the construction site. The project subcontractor, Yao Chun-xi, was burdened with heavy responsibilities, busy like a flywheel, and during the intense construction period, often worked for days and nights without rest, with red eyes and fatigue-induced nausea, he would just take a few pills of Ren Dan. In such an atmosphere, the workers seemed to see the "Jiao Yu-lu" and "Wang Tie-ren" of the past; as long as they were part of it, who would not strive to be the first and work hard? A labor competition of "ensuring quality, safety, and schedule, creating a high-quality project" was launched on the construction site. Saving time and increasing efficiency became the workers' voluntary actions. One worker's father passed away, and he took care of the funeral at night and continued to work during the day. Another worker's family was also building a house, but for the sake of the station's construction, he stopped his own work.

The driver who went to another province to transport tiles, in order to save time, when the car's radiator was low on water, he braved the long journey's thirst and poured the water he needed to drink into the radiator.

During the critical stage of construction, labor was severely short, and some outsourced teams took advantage of the situation to increase labor costs as a condition for hiring more workers. The workers of the construction company patted their chests and said they wouldn't take an extra cent, one person doing the work of several, and took on the task.

In the past, dismantling a 80-ton crane would take at least half a month, but now, in the hands of these "three brave men," such a crane, which 30 large trucks couldn't carry, was dismantled in just 3 days.

While the husbands were working day and night outside, how was the family arranged? The leaders of the construction company also did ideological and political work in the homes of the workers. Leaders visited the families of middle-level cadres, middle-level cadres visited the families of team leaders, and team leaders visited the families of workers. Funerals of the elderly, children's illnesses, and heavy household chores were all properly addressed during the visits. Seeing their husbands working hard and the city's attention-focused station standing tall through their hard work, the kind-hearted wives silently packed their husbands' dirty clothes into bags with smiles.

There were no empty gestures, no empty rhetoric. Ideological work was like a gentle spring rain, dripping into people's hearts. Precious spirit of dedication, selfless labor enthusiasm, and high cohesion, like fragrant buds, bloomed in this gentle spring rain.

On January 25 of this year, the new Wuxi Railway Station was completed ahead of schedule. The leaders of the Shanghai Railway Bureau said: "This is the high speed achieved by the people of Wuxi with the spirit of Wuxi."

A responsible comrade who led this project said: "Some people say that the Chinese are lazy, but how can we be content with laziness? The masses have boundless enthusiasm and creativity, once the gate is opened, it will surge out. And opening this gate, relying solely on the power of money is not enough. Fortunately, we found the key to opening this gate."

    （一）
    １９８７年秋，无锡市人民政府决定改造建于８０多年前、已成危房的无锡火车站。按设计，完成这个规模和吞吐能力仅次于上海站的工程需要６４５天。１９８８年春节前，大规模的拆迁工作结束，工程准备上马。这时，上海铁路局和无锡市政府要求这个工程在１９８９年春节前交付运行，以适应沿海经济的发展。这就意味着工程必须在３００天的时间里完成。
    建设部命名的思想政治工作先进企业、久经考验的建筑劲旅——无锡市建筑工程公司决定承包这项工程。
    最大的困难不是时间紧，也不是任务重，而是怎样找到调动人的积极性的手段。多劳多得的经济手段是有效的，然而，当青年工人在脚手架上看到下面的小摊小贩大把赚钱时，他们发现有更合算的赚钱门路。光靠钱，是很难保证工人有持久的积极性的。
    公司党委决定：双管齐下！把思想政治工作同经济手段密切配合起来。
    施工中，这个公司抽调最强的建筑队进驻工地，并采用分解承包的办法组织２３个兄弟单位协同作战，在工地上建立了生产指挥、质量监控、安全生产、治安保卫四大管理网络，全面落实了岗位责任制。同时，一整套强化思想政治工作的措施紧紧跟上。工地临时党支部迅速建立起来，二十多个单位的领导成员都上了工地；一批党团员、青年突击队和先进班组走上了最艰巨的岗位；公司的宣传班子也上了第一线，出快报，印特刊，及时表彰施工中的先进事迹；从工程队到班组，都落实专人抓思想政治工作。让工人们树立“为‘四化’争贡献”的价值观，认识到用自己的双手为无锡这个沿海重要的经济和旅游城市建造高标准门户的意义。
　（二）
    在施工中，领导干部和党团员的模范行动，成了最有效的思想政治工作。工程总指挥、无锡市建委主任沈青松从施工第一天起就把铺盖搬到工地，同工人一起奋战，连中秋节、元旦都不回家。副指挥董伟患哮喘病，痰中带血，每次输液完，他便风风火火地返回工地。工程承包队队长姚春锡身负重任，忙得像个飞轮，在施工紧张的时候，常常几天几夜不休息，眼睛红红的，累了，恶心呕吐，他就吞几粒仁丹。在这样的氛围里，工人们仿佛又看到了当年的“焦裕禄”、“王铁人”；只要置身其中，谁能不奋勇当先、拚命大干呢！一场“保质量、保安全、保工期、创优质工程”的劳动竞赛，在工地上展开了。抢时间，争效率，成了工人们自觉的行动。有个工人父亲病故，他晚上回家料理，白天照常上班。有个工人家里也在盖房，为了车站建设，断然停了自家的工。
    去外地运贴面砖的驾驶员，为了抢时间，当汽车水箱缺水时，竟冒着长途跋涉的焦渴，把水瓶中自己要喝的水倒进了水箱。
    施工关键阶段，劳力严重短缺，个别外地的承包队乘机以增加工值作为增人的条件，建筑公司的工人们拍拍胸脯，不要加１分钱，一人顶几人用，把任务顶了下来。
    过去，拆卸１座８０吨米的大型塔吊，至少得半个月，如今在这些“拚命三郎”手中，这样１座３０辆大卡车都装不下的塔吊，不消３天就拆卸完了。
　（三）
    丈夫在外日日夜夜地苦干，家里怎么安排？建筑公司的干部又把思想政治工作做到职工家里。领导干部走访中层干部家庭，中层干部走访班组干部家庭，班组干部走访工人家庭。老人的丧事，孩子的疾病，沉重的家务，在访问中一一得到妥善解决。看到丈夫龙腾虎跃大干的劲头，看到那全市瞩目的车站在丈夫的辛勤劳动下挺立起来，善良的妻子们含着微笑，默默地将丈夫的脏衣服塞进提包。
    没有花架子，没有空泛的大道理，思想工作如同春风细雨，点点滴滴渗进人们的心田。可贵的奉献精神，忘我的劳动热情，高度的凝聚力，有如散发着芳馨的朵朵花蕾，在这春风细雨中绽开了。
    今年１月２５日，无锡新车站提前完工。上海铁路局领导同志说：“这是无锡人用无锡精神创造的高速度。”
    领导这项工程建设的一位负责同志说：“有人说中国人懒散，其实我们何尝甘于懒散？群众身上蕴藏着不可估量的积极性和创造性，一旦闸门打开，就会喷涌而出。而打开这个闸门，光靠金钱的力量是不够的。幸运的是，我们找到了打开这闸门的钥匙。”
