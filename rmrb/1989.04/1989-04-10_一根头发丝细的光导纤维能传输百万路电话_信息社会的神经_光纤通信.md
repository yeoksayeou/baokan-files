Since the 1980s, many countries have adopted optical fibers as a means of transmitting information. The United States, Japan, and several Western European countries have each established their own optical fiber communication networks. While constructing domestic main long-distance lines, the United States has also collaborated with countries like the UK, France, and Japan to lay underwater optical cables across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The underwater cable across the Atlantic was completed at the end of last year, capable of transmitting 40,000 phone calls simultaneously. The cable connecting the two sides of the Pacific is expected to be operational by this April. A global optical fiber communication network is taking shape.

Optical fibers open up new realms in communication

Optical fiber communication is a new technology that emerged in the 1970s. It converts information from electrical pulses into light pulses using lasers, which are then transmitted through special glass fibers as thin as a human hair. At the receiving end, the light pulses are converted back into electrical pulses. Optical fiber communication has advantages over copper cables, such as faster transmission speeds, higher capacity, greater accuracy, and higher clarity. People refer to optical fibers as the nerves of the information society.

Optical fiber communication has opened up many new communication services. In densely populated cities and hilly areas, optical fiber lines can be used to transmit television and stereo FM programs to ensure transmission quality. It can transmit bidirectional data, connecting computers into a network. It can build an integrated services digital network to provide users with various information services such as telephone, video phone, high-speed fax, bidirectional data transmission, and information sales. Ultimately, it may develop into a global integrated services digital network. In power and railway systems, the anti-electromagnetic interference advantages of optical fiber communication can be utilized to lay optical cables along power lines and electrified railways, ensuring smooth command and dispatch. In office buildings, universities, research institutions, and factories, optical fiber communication area networks can be used to transmit voice, data, and images to improve work efficiency.

Symbol of modern telephones

Currently, optical fiber communication technology is mainly used for telephone services. In the past 10 years, developed countries such as North America, Japan, and Western Europe have collectively laid over 10 million kilometers of optical fiber lines. The American Telephone and Telegraph Company and other telephone companies have laid 111,000 optical cables, doubling the telephone communication capacity across the United States. According to a report from the "Home Shopping Center" in Florida, the center handles an average of 100,000 phone orders per day. The center also connects the optical cable to the internal computer system, enhancing communication with branch offices across the country. Nowadays, almost all long-distance calls within the United States use optical cables.

The UK had laid 20,000 kilometers of optical cables by the end of 1986. In 1987, West Germany completed a long-distance optical fiber trunk line connecting 29 cities. France plans to build a long-distance trunk line of approximately 50,000 kilometers centered in Paris by 1990. In Japan, the optical fiber communication network connects the Japanese archipelago.

Currently, international long-distance telephone lines are gradually shifting from satellite or underwater cables to optical cables.

The era of optical communication

Obviously, optical fiber communication will bring about a significant transformation in modern communication. A single hair-thin optical fiber can transmit millions of phone calls. Moreover, optical fibers can transmit high-definition images and complex computational data at speeds 100 to 1,000 times faster than copper cables. Currently, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation is working on applying optical fibers to intelligent communication systems, integrating voice, data, television, and fax systems. Major American telephone companies are also accelerating the research on applying optical fibers to television networks. Currently, television signals are mainly transmitted through shared antennas and distributed to users via copper coaxial cables. However, this cannot meet the rapidly increasing demands of modern communication. People require high-definition, fast, and multi-functional television networks. The problem is that laying new copper cables requires a large amount of metal materials and is costly and inefficient. Optical fibers compensate for the shortcomings of copper cables and can also save materials and energy. The American Telephone and Telegraph Company is confident in the wide application of optical fibers in services such as video phones, video recording, and shopping through television screens. In the future, users can sit at home and directly communicate with television program production centers to order programs. In the future, ordinary households will spend only a few minutes on the phone each day, but several hours watching television. It can be asserted that optical fibers will enter households, and human society will transition from the era of electrical communication to the era of optical communication.

　　一根头发丝细的光导纤维能传输百万路电话
    信息社会的神经——光纤通信
    国技经　贾光伟
    ８０年代以来，许多国家将光纤作为传输信息的手段。美国、日本和西欧一些国家分别建成了各自的光纤通信网。美国建成国内主要长途干线的同时，还同英、法、日等国合作敷设穿越大西洋和太平洋的海底光缆。穿越大西洋的光缆已于去年底建成，可同时通４万路电话。连接太平洋两岸的光缆预计今年４月交付使用。全球性光纤通信网正在形成。
    光纤开拓通信新领域
    光纤通信是７０年代发展起来的一项新技术。它是利用激光将信息由电脉冲变换成光脉冲，经仅有头发丝细的特殊玻璃纤维传递，在终端还原成电脉冲。光纤通信具有传递速度快、负荷量大、准确性强、清晰度高等铜制电缆所不具备的优点。人们称光纤为信息社会的神经。
    光纤通信开拓了许多新的通信业务。在大楼林立的大城市和丘陵地区可用光纤线路传送电视和调频立体声节目，以保证传输质量。它可以传输双向数据，把计算机联接成网。可建成综合服务数字网，为用户提供电话、可视电话、高速传真、双向数据传输、信息销售等多种信息服务，最终可能发展成全球性综合服务数字网。在电力和铁道系统，可利用光纤通信抗电磁干扰的优点，沿电力线和电气铁道架设光缆，保证指挥调度畅通。在办公楼、大学、研究机构和工厂里，可用光纤通信区域网传递话音、数据和图像以提高工作效率。
    现代电话的象征
    目前，光纤通信技术大多用于电话业务。在过去１０年中，北美、日本和西欧等发达国家已共计敷设１０００多万公里的光纤线路。美国电话和电报公司和其它电话公司共敷设了１１．１万条光缆，使全美电话通讯能力增加一倍。据佛罗里达州“家庭购物中心”报告，该中心日平均受理电话订购业务达１０万次。这个中心还将光缆同中心内部计算机系统连接，增强与各地分公司的联系。如今，美国国内的长途电话几乎全部采用光缆。
    英国于１９８６年底已铺设光缆２万公里。１９８７年西德完成了连接２９个城市的光纤长途干线。法国计划１９９０年建成以巴黎为中心的全长约５万光纤公里的长途干线。在日本，光纤通信网将日本诸岛连接起来。
    现在，国际长途电话线路已逐步由过去的卫星或海底电缆传递转为用光缆。
    光通信时代
    显然，光纤通信将带来现代通信的大变革。一根头发丝细的光导纤维即可传输上百万路电话。并且光纤还能够以高于铜缆１００至１０００倍的速度传输高清晰度的图像和复杂的计算数据。眼下，日本电报电话公司正在致力于将光纤用于智能通信系统，把声频、数据、电视和传真系统结合起来。美国各大电话公司又在加紧研究将光纤应用于电视网络。现在，电视信号的传输，主要是依靠共用天线通过铜制同轴电缆分送到用户。然而，这已无法满足迅速增加的现代通信的需要。人们要求清晰度高，速度快并具有多项性服务的电视网。问题在于，铺设新的铜缆需要花费大量的金属原材料，且投资高，效率低。光纤弥补了铜电缆的缺陷，也可以节省原材料和能源。美国电话和电报公司对光纤的广泛应用如可视电话、录相、通过电视屏幕选购商品等充满信心。将来，用户可以坐在家中，直接与电视节目制作中心联系，点播节目。今后，普通家庭每天打电话仅用几分钟，看电视的时间长达几小时。可以断言，光纤将进入家庭，人类社会将从电通信时代进入光通信时代。
