In the rural areas of Rizhao City, Shandong Province, party members like to hold "Party Day" (which is the "Party Life Meeting"). The decisions made by the party branch on developing the commodity economy are often made during "Party Day"; the mistakes of party members are often pointed out and criticized during "Party Day". "Party Day" is both a democratic life meeting and a democratic decision-making meeting. The following are stories from three "Party Days".

(1)

In Shiyu Village, non-party member Zhu Jixi has been running a family mink farm and a flower nursery for a few years, earning over ten thousand yuan a year and becoming wealthy. Last year, he saw that the children in the village had no place to attend kindergarten, so he went to the village party branch secretary and took out a stack of money, saying, "Secretary, I'm donating this money to discuss with you the construction of a kindergarten. Raising the next generation is a big deal!" With the support of the village party branch secretary, it took only two months to build a kindergarten.

Zhu Jixi's actions made all the party members in the village feel ashamed. On "Party Day," all 48 party members in the village attended. Zhu Jixi was invited to speak at the meeting. He said, "Donating ten thousand or eight thousand yuan to do something for everyone is what I should do. Recently, a few friends came to my door and asked me to invest my money in their enterprises, saying that I would get double the dividends at the end of the year, but I didn't agree. They said I'm not a party member and I'm stupid! I'm willing to be a fool and do something good for my fellow villagers."

After Zhu Jixi finished speaking, the party members started discussing. Village head Wang Xixing said, "In recent years, we party members have talked less about serving the people and more about our own affairs. As for my personal feelings, my spirit has lost its support. I don't have much money in my hands, and I can't do what Brother Zhu did, but I am willing to contribute to our village. I still have some money saved up to build a house, and I will use it to install running water pipes for the village to improve the water quality!" "I'll contribute 100 yuan," "I'll put in 500 yuan." The party members collected money, and with the village's public funds, 150,000 yuan was raised. A water tower and pipes were built, and everyone drank sweet tap water.

Pei Jia Village is a first-class wealthy village in Rizhao City, with an annual income of over 20 million yuan. However, this village has not built an office building or bought a car like some other villages.

The party cadres in Pei Jia Village were looked down upon by people in neighboring villages. "Vibrant, don't be so shabby. You lead everyone to work, and our village has become rich. We are all happy in our hearts, so buying a car is fine with us." The village's old men would always nag at the party branch secretary Pei Zhenzhou whenever they saw him. Pei Zhenzhou always responded with a smile. Once, during a "Party Day," the village party branch and village committee members squatted by the stove discussing the construction of a building and buying a car. Everyone's opinion was to build and buy. At the beginning of last year, during a "Party Day," all 71 party members in the village attended. At the beginning of the meeting, old party member Zhang Jiren stood up and presented two opposing opinions: there are already flat buildings to use, so there is no need to build an office building; buying a car has little practical value, not only does it cost a lot of money, but it will also affect the relationship between officials and the people, so it is better to buy a truck. Some people at the meeting said he was right, while others said he had old-fashioned ideas.

Some party cadres said, "Our village is a civilized village. Leaders from higher levels come to inspect and guide work more often, so not building an office building or buying a car is too rustic!" Some party cadres believed that the more they did things like building and buying for appearances, the more it showed the weight of their "achievements." Some party members thought that as long as the money was not used to enrich individuals, there was nothing wrong with spending some money to dress up the appearance.

Zhang Jiren did not agree with these views. He said a bit excitedly, "What is 'achievement'? Doing something real for the people is the true achievement. In recent years, our village has become richer than before, but compared to wealthy villages outside, we are still far behind. Using the money to develop the tidal flats and develop enterprises, the people will praise us!" Zhang Jiren gradually gained the upper hand, and finally everyone decided to use the 200-plus ten thousand yuan of funds to build a dam to block the sea, and to build a shipyard, net factory, and cold storage factory. As a result, 200-plus mu of tidal flats were used to raise shrimp, earning 80-plus ten thousand yuan in the first year; all enterprises in the village did not suffer losses, and the annual output value reached 20 million-plus yuan.

Every 28th of the month is "Party Day" in Shanqian Village, Rizhao City.

All 30 party members in the village gathered to face-to-face engage in criticism and self-criticism. At the beginning of last year, during one such meeting, old party member Wang Shaocheng made a light self-criticism and was subjected to sharp criticism by the party members.

Wang Shaocheng was once a model worker. After the implementation of the responsibility system, he did not understand the contract system. He was determined not to pay the public grain. He thought that as an old party member, no one could do anything to him, and he had a bad influence on the people. Seeing that he was becoming more and more stubborn, the party branch secretary Wang Shaowei moved this matter to "Party Day" for the party members to "evaluate."

"You are an old party member. In the revolutionary period, you charged into battle and received a lot of education from the party. Why are you not as good as ordinary people now? Not only do you not pay the public grain, but you also cause others not to pay. Where is your party spirit?" Some party members sharply criticized him.

"I have opinions about the branch, so I don't pay the grain."

"Brother Shaocheng, you are an old party member and should set a good example. You can raise your opinions about the branch, but you can't not pay the public grain! If party members don't pay the public grain, how will the people listen to the party branch? Don't forget that we are party members!" The secretary said sincerely. Wang Shaocheng gradually accepted the criticism. He said, "I was wrong, and I am ashamed of the party. I hope everyone will help me in the future."

A round of criticism indeed worked. Wang Shaocheng not only made up for the unpaid public grain at once but also, in the face of last year's drought, was the one who paid the most public grain among households with the same population in the village.

　　党日
    范奉东　张守堂
    在山东省日照市农村，党员们喜欢“党日”（即“党的生活会”）。党支部对发展商品经济的决策，往往是在“党日”决定的；党员的错误，往往是在“党日”被指出、受批评的。“党日”既是民主生活会，也是民主决策会。这里记叙的是发生在三个“党日”上的事。
    （一）
    石臼一村非党群众朱纪喜，这几年办家庭养貂场和花卉培植场，年收入超过万元，富起来了。去年他看到村里的孩子没个地方入托，便找到村党支部书记，掏出一摞人民币，说：“书记，俺献出这钱是想和您商议一下建座幼儿园的。培养后代可是件大事啊！”在村党支部书记的支持下，只用了两个月，一座幼儿园建成了。
    朱纪喜这个行为，使全村党员感到惭愧。“党日”那天，全村４８名党员全到了。朱纪喜应邀到会讲话，他说：“俺捐个万儿八千为大伙儿办点事是应该的。前些时，几个朋友找上门来让俺把钱入他们企业的股，年底分双份红，俺没答应。他们说俺又不是党员，傻透了！俺情愿当个傻子，为乡亲们做点好事。”
    朱纪喜讲完话，党员们议论起来了。村主任王西兴说：“这几年，我们党员谈为人民服务少了，想自己的事多了。就我本身的感觉，精神没了支柱。我手里没有多少钱，也办不了朱大哥那样的事，可我愿意为咱村出点力。我手里还攒了点钱准备盖房，拿出来给村里安自来水管，改善一下水质吧！”“我拿１００元”，“我搁５００元”，党员们一筹集，再加上村里的公款，１５万元凑齐了，一座水塔和一道道水管建成了，大家喝上了甜甜的自来水。
    （二）
    裴家村是日照市的一流富裕村，年收入达２０００多万元。然而，这个村却没有像有的村那样盖办公楼，买小轿车。
    裴家村的党员干部们因此被邻村人瞧不起。“振洲，别再寒酸了。你领着大伙儿干，俺们村富了，俺们满心里高兴，买个小车，俺们没意见。”村里的老汉碰上党支部书记裴振洲，总要唠叨一番，裴振洲每次都以嘿嘿一笑作答。一次党日，村党支部和村委会成员蹲在炉子旁商量盖楼、买小车的事，大伙儿的意见是盖、买。去年初，在一个党日上，全村７１名党员全到齐了。会议一开始，老党员张纪任站起来摆了两条反对意见：现在有平房用，没有必要盖办公楼；买小轿车实用价值不大，不仅花钱多，而且还会影响干群关系，不如买辆货车实用大。会上，有人说他说的在理，也有人说他老观念。
    有的党员干部说，咱村是个文明村，上级领导来参观检查、指导工作的比较多，不盖幢办公楼、买辆小轿车太土气！还有的党员干部认为，盖楼、买车等面子上的事搞得越多，越显出“政绩”的份量。有的党员认为，只要花钱不肥个人就没什么，装装门面花些钱也值得。
    张纪任不同意这些看法。他有点激动地说：“啥叫‘政绩’？为群众办点实实在在的事儿，才是真正的政绩。这几年，咱们村比以前是富了，但同外地的富村比，咱还远着哩。把钱用在滩涂开发、发展企业上，群众才称赞呢！”
    张纪任渐渐占了上风，最后大伙儿决定把２００多万元的资金用于建坝拦海，修造船厂、网厂和冷藏厂。结果，２００多亩海涂养对虾，当年就收入８０多万元；全村所有企业无一个亏损，年产值达到２０００多万元。
    （三）
    每月２８日，是日照市山前村的党日。
    全村３０名党员聚集一堂，面对面地展开批评与自我批评。去年初有一次，有４０多年党龄的老党员王绍臣作自我批评轻描淡写，受到党员们的尖锐批评。
    王少臣过去是个老模范，实行责任制后，对承包制想不通。憋着一股劲儿，年年不交公粮。自以为是老党员，别人奈何不了他，在群众中造成了不好的影响。党支部书记王绍伟见他越来越犟，就把这事挪到了“党日”上，由党员来“评议”。
    “你是个老党员，在革命时期冲锋陷阵，受党的教育多，现在为什么还不如一般群众？不但自己不交公粮，还让别人不交公粮，你的党性到哪里去啦？”有的党员尖锐批评他。
    “我对支部有意见，所以不交粮。”
    “绍臣哥，你是老党员了，应带个好头；你对支部有意见尽管提，不能不交公粮啊！党员都不交公粮，群众还怎么听党支部的话？别忘了咱是党员啊！”支书推心置腹地说。王绍臣渐渐被说服了。他说：“我错了，我有愧于党。希望今后大家多帮助我。”
    一场批评，果然灵验，王绍臣不仅把未交的公粮一次补齐，而且在去年天旱的情况下，还是全村相同人口户中交粮最多的。
