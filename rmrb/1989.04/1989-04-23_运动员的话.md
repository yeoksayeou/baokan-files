Words from Athletes

	No matter now or in the future, I can only use this sentence to spur myself on: Be humble in victory and steadfast in adversity.

		Liu Hai Guang

	Achievements and honors, once obtained, become history. The path ahead continues to extend, and if one wants to achieve new results, it will be even more difficult and require greater sacrifices.

		Li Ling Wei

	When a person is in adversity and faces setbacks, it is not entirely a bad thing. The key is to have the courage to rise from adversity. As long as one perseveres unyieldingly and persists, success will eventually be achieved. People must have that spirit of not being willing to fall behind.

		Lie Wei Ping

	To make progress, one must strive, including challenging one's own weaknesses, overcoming one's own softness and cowardice.

		Jiang Jia Liang

	If a person lacks a goal to strive for, they lose their luster. If you don't want to be a champion, you're not a chess player.

		Chen Zu De

专栏：运动员的话

　　运动员的话
    不管现在还是将来，我只有用这样一句话来鞭策自己：于胜利时见谦虚，于逆境中见坚韧。　　　　　　
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　柳海光
    成绩和荣誉在得到的同时便属于历史了，而脚下的路仍在延伸着，若想获得新的成绩就更加艰难，要付出更大代价。　　　　　　　　　
　　　　　李玲蔚
    一个人身处逆境，经历挫折，不全是件坏事。关键是要有勇气从逆境中奋起。只要自强不息，坚持不懈，终能成功。人总得要有那么一股不甘落后的“气”才行。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
　　聂卫平
    要进取，就要拚搏，包括向自己身上的弱点挑战，向自己的软弱和怯懦挑战。
  　江嘉良
    一个人没有奋斗目标就失去了光彩。不想当冠军就不是棋手。　　
    陈祖德
