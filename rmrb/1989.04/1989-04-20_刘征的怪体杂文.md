Edition: 8

The era calls for essays, and readers' interest in essays is thriving alongside the contributions of essayists, thus people have noticed Liu Zheng in the "thorny" art gallery.

Readers' aesthetic psychology has, in recent years, explored and created new and unique methods of expression for essays, leading essay writing out of the dull and rigid circle it was once confined to.

Readers have long grown tired of the "old three-part structure" (a segment of historical anecdote or record, a segment of contemporary social phenomena, and a segment of commentary) and lengthy moralizing. Liu Zheng seeks a unique structure—based on "need" and "possibility" (similar to the natural law of use it or lose it)—to make essays eccentric. This makes them more literary, more captivating, and more infectious.

Storytelling is a traditional art form with a wide audience. Liu Zheng's storytelling-style essay "The 'Helping' Method of Elevating Issues," created over ten years ago, has been acknowledged by society. This form of storytelling (narrating) one segment and singing (chanting) one segment not only makes the work's content more profound but also enhances its artistic charm. It is both easy to understand and lively.

Fables originally possess the embryonic form of essays. Liu Zheng, taking advantage of this, introduces this folk literary form into essays, which is a perfect match. Works like "The Frog Who Thought Himself Clever" and "Zhuangzi Selling Water" are either like fables or fairy tales.

Perhaps due to his talent in scriptwriting, Liu Zheng's exploration of using the yuan opera form to create essays has been very successful. Works like "Wu Song Fights the Tiger" and "The Lord of Ye Curses the Dragon" have consecutively been released. This style of writing makes Liu Zheng's essays more humorous and intense.

Liu Zheng also writes essays in the form of direct visual arts like theater, utilizing comprehensive stage art to serve his essay images, which is truly unique! Works like "The Horse and the Rider" and "A Patch for 'The Gate Beheading'" bring "flat articles" to the "three-dimensional stage," making readers feel as if they can see the person and hear the voice. This is essentially the dramatization of essays.

The overuse of historical anecdotes and records is wasteful, but discarding them is regrettable. Liu Zheng comprehensively manages this, tentatively called the "scholarly style." Thus, works like "A Miscellany on the 'Preface to the Holy Teaching'" and "A Rambling Discussion on Gluttony" were born. "Understanding the Leopard's Tail in 'Journey to the West'" seems to be a discussion on the merits and demerits of the ending of the classical novel "Journey to the West," but it is actually the final stroke that brings the essay to life, making it unique.

So far, Liu Zheng has published over 200 essay poems. Essay poems are quite rare. Are they poems? Are they essays? Their difference from essays lies in their line breaks and paragraphs, highly condensed and summarized language, like proverbs or aphorisms; their difference from poems lies in the expression of philosophical ideas with one or two sentences, without the emotional expression of poetry or the depiction of real life. Although it is difficult to master the balance, readers still love them, and many students and young people copy Liu Zheng's essay poems.

Roughly speaking, the number of Liu Zheng's essays written in traditional styles is very small. One essayist said, "Method is also power," which is indeed true. Liu Zheng broadens the methods of expression for essays, injecting new vitality, undoubtedly contributing to the development of contemporary essays.

Exploration is not reckless, and creation is not reckless either. The success of any artistic method cannot bypass the recognition of readers and society, while the writer, based on the needs and possibilities of the work, cannot talk about the work's vitality; Liu Zheng's exploration and creation are not only beneficial to the development of essay styles and schools but also, if we are not biased, have broader significance.

　　刘征的怪体杂文
    刘成信
    时代呼唤杂文，读者对杂文的兴趣勃兴与杂文家的奉献呈双向选择，于是，人们在“带刺”的艺术画廊中注意到了刘征。
    读者审美心理的取向，近年来探索、创造着杂文的新颖表现手法，使杂文创作走出了一向被人认为枯燥、呆板的怪圈。
    读者对杂文的“老三段”（一段典故或史料、一段当今社会现象、一段议论）和通篇训人说教早已厌弃，刘征探求一种特殊的格局——根据“需要”与“可能”（如同自然界的用进废退）使杂文呈怪体状。更具文学色彩，从而更引人入胜，更富感染力。
    说唱是传统艺术，有着广泛的群众，刘征早在１０年前创作的说唱式杂文《“帮”式上纲法》已被社会首肯，这种说（叙述）一段唱（口诀）一段的形式，不仅使作品思想内容更凝重，而且增强了艺术魅力，既通俗易懂，又生动火暴。
    寓言，它原本具有杂文雏形，刘征“因势利导”将这种民间文学形式引进杂文，可谓相得益彰。《自以为聪明的蛤蟆》、《庄周卖水》等篇，有的似寓言，有的像童话。
    也许是他兼有编剧的才华，刘征探索用元曲形式创作杂文连连爆响，《武大打虎》、《叶公骂龙》等相继出台，这种笔法使刘征杂文的幽默感更强更浓。
    刘征还用直观艺术话剧形式写杂文，调动综合性舞台艺术为其杂文形象服务，堪称一绝！《骏马和骑手》、《歪补〈辕门斩子〉》等将“平面文章”搬到“立体舞台”上，令读者如见其人如闻其声，这其实是杂文戏剧化。
    典故、史料多用则滥，弃之可惜，刘征对此综合治理，姑且称之“考证式”，于是乎诸如《〈圣教序〉杂议》、《大吃大喝漫考》便应运而生，《悟〈西游记〉的豹尾》意犹考证古典小说《西游记》结尾之优劣、文野，实则最后一笔画龙点睛，可谓别具一格。
    迄今，刘征已发表２００余首杂文诗。杂文以诗作，尚属鲜见，诗耶？杂文耶？其区别于杂文者，乃分行分节，语言高度凝炼、概括，似谚语、若警句；其不同于诗者，即多以一、二句话表达一种哲理，没有诗的意境之抒情，更无对现实生活之描绘。虽分寸不易掌握，然确为读者所喜爱，许多中小学生和青年传抄刘征的杂文诗。
    粗略地统计一下，刘征完全以传统写法创作的杂文为数很少。有位杂文家说：“方法也是力量”，确有道理。刘征拓宽了杂文表现手法，注入新的活力，无疑对发展当代杂文是个贡献。
    探索不是胡来，创造也不是乱闯，任何艺术手法的成功都不能绕开读者和社会的公认，而作家则是根据作品的需要和可能，舍此便谈不上作品的生命力；刘征的探索和创造其意义不仅仅有益于杂文风格和流派的发展，如果我们不怀偏见的话。
