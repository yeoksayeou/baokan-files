Foreign Ministry Spokesperson on the Issue of Peaceful Reunification of China
“One Country, Two Systems” is the Most Practical and Realistic Solution

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Jin Guihua said at today’s afternoon press conference, “One Country, Two Systems” is the most practical and realistic solution for the peaceful reunification of China.

Jin Guihua made these remarks in response to the recent proposal by the Taiwan authorities of the idea of “one China, two equal governments.”

He said, “It is well known that there is only one China, and the government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China. Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. Any actions or statements that could lead to ‘two Chinas’ or ‘one China, one Taiwan’ are firmly opposed by us.”

A reporter asked, “China recently established diplomatic relations with Bahrain, but the joint communiqué did not mention, as in the past, that ‘the government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal government of China.’ Was the issue of the Taipei Commercial Representative Office in Bahrain discussed when China and Bahrain established diplomatic relations?”

The spokesperson said, “China and Bahrain establishing diplomatic relations is in line with the fundamental interests and wishes of the peoples of both countries, marking a new stage in the friendly relations between the two countries. Since the two countries have established diplomatic relations, it goes without saying that the government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legal government of China.”

The reporter also asked, “Is it possible that China will still use force against Taiwan?”

The spokesperson said, “Peaceful reunification of the motherland is our established policy because it is in the fundamental interests and common wishes of the Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. However, this does not entirely depend on us. We have never promised not to use non-peaceful means. The reason is simple: if we make such a promise, it will bring great difficulties to the peaceful reunification.”

The spokesperson also expressed welcome to the news that Ms. Guo Wanrong will lead the Chinese Taipei delegation to attend the annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank in Beijing.

### 外交部发言人谈和平统一中国问题  “一国两制”是最实际最现实方案

　　外交部发言人谈和平统一中国问题    
    “一国两制”是最实际最现实方案
    新华社北京４月２０日电  外交部发言人金桂华在今天下午的新闻发布会上说，“一国两制”是实现中国和平统一的最符合实际的、最现实的方案。
    金桂华是针对台湾当局最近提出的“一个中国、两个对等政府”的新构想发表这番评论的。
    他说，众所周知，中国只有一个，中华人民共和国政府是代表全中国的唯一合法政府，台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分。任何可能导致“两个中国”或“一中一台”的言行，都是我们坚决反对的。
    有记者问，中国最近与巴林建立了外交关系，但在联合公报中，没有像以往那样提到“中华人民共和国政府为中国唯一合法政府”；中巴建交时是否谈到台北在巴林设有商务代表处一事？
    发言人说，中国和巴林建交符合两国人民的根本利益和愿望，标志着两国友好关系进入了新的阶段。既然两国建交，中华人民共和国政府是中国唯一合法的政府这一点是不言而喻的。
    记者还问，中国是否还有可能仍对台湾使用武力？
    发言人说，和平统一祖国是我们的既定方针，因为这符合海峡两岸中国人民的根本利益和共同愿望。但是这不完全取决于我们。我们从来没有承诺不使用非和平方式。道理很简单，承诺了就会给和平统一带来极大的困难。
    发言人还对郭婉容女士将率领中国台北代表团来京参加本届亚洲银行年会表示欢迎。
