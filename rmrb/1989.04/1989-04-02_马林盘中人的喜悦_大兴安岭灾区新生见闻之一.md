This is the first spring after all the disaster-stricken people of the Greater Khingan Range have moved into their new homes. On the road leading to the Malin and Panzhong forest farms in Tahe County, trucks loaded with burned wood are constantly coming and going. The author is delighted to see that the charred earth and ruins left by the "May 6" inferno have long disappeared. Before us are wide, smooth roads and rows of bright, new brick houses.

Recently, the author met an elderly man named Xie Songjin, who had suffered third-degree burns, strolling calmly on the streets of Malin. Before the "May 6" fire, he had just arrived from Zhejiang to visit his son. After the disaster, the Party and the government did not forget this outsider and used a helicopter to send him to Daqing City for emergency treatment. In his new home with three rooms and a kitchen, the floor heating is warm, a 18-inch color TV is broadcasting programs from the central station, a brand-new double-door refrigerator stands by the window, and all the items and furniture in the house are new. There is not a trace of the disaster here. The forest farm leader accompanying me said: The state not only built new houses for the disaster-stricken people but also distributed clothing, bedding, tables, chairs, and tableware. The bank also exchanged 30,000 yuan in unexpired national savings bonds for the disaster-stricken people in advance. The Party and the government's meticulous care has greatly inspired the forest farm workers' determination and enthusiasm to stand on their own feet. The Panzhong Forest Farm's winter logging of burned wood was not only completed 7 days ahead of schedule but also won the laurels for completing tasks, logging area quality, mechanical management, living management, and work section construction in all items in the entire forestry bureau. Panzhong Forest Farm Director Zhao Zengfu introduced a series of thought-provoking figures to the author: During the disaster, more than 200 impoverished households are now equipped with more than 100 TV sets, 80 tape recorders, 91 washing machines, and 18 motorcycles. These numbers are still increasing.

　　马林盘中人的喜悦
    ——大兴安岭灾区新生见闻之一
    戴天
    这是大兴安岭全部灾民搬入新居后的第一个春天。在通往塔河县马林、盘中两林场的公路上，满载火烧木的运材车穿梭往来。笔者欣喜地看到：那“五·六”炼狱之夜留下的焦土、废墟早已消失。眼前是一条条宽阔平整的大道；一排排窗明瓦亮的新砖房。
    最近，笔者见到正在马林街头安然散步的三度烧伤的老人谢松金。“五·六”大火之前，他刚从浙江前来探望儿子。遭难后，党和政府没忘掉这个外来者，用直升飞机把他送到大庆市抢救。在他的三屋一厨的新居中，土暖气散着热，１８英寸的彩电播着中央台节目，崭新的双门电冰箱靠窗而立，屋里的一切用品，家具全是新的，这儿看不到一丝受灾的痕迹。陪同我的林场领导说：国家不但为灾民盖新房，还发放了衣、被、桌椅、餐具等物品。银行提前给灾民兑换了没有到期的３万元国库券。党和政府无微不至的关怀，极大地激发了林场职工自强自立的决心和干劲。盘中林场冬季抢采火烧木不但提前７天完成任务，而且还摘取了全林业局完成任务、伐区质量、机械管理、生活管理、工段建设等各项指标的桂冠。盘中林场场长赵增福向笔者介绍了一串耐人寻味的数字：灾中，一贫如洗的２００多户家庭，如今已有电视机１００多台，收录机８０多台，洗衣机９１台，摩托车１８辆。这些数字还在不断增加。
