A hijacking incident was thwarted over Fuzhou. The plane landed safely, and the hijacker died by self-detonation.

FUZHOU, April 26 (Xinhua) — On the afternoon of the 24th, a Y-7 passenger plane operated by China Eastern Airlines, en route from Ningbo to Xiamen, was hijacked by a criminal. Due to the close cooperation between the crew and passengers, the criminal's plot was foiled, and the plane safely landed at Fuzhou Airport.

It has been confirmed that the hijacker, Liang Aozhen, is 26 years old and works as an underground telephone technician at the Qiaotou Mine of the Jian Mountain Mining Bureau in Gao'an County, Jiangxi Province. Last July, he used the pretext of "conducting a photography training class" to send out recruitment brochures nationwide for fraudulent activities. Early this year, local public security authorities received letters of complaint from various places exposing Liang's fraudulent activities. The public security department had already initiated an investigation against Liang. On April 10, Liang requested leave and, on the afternoon of the 24th, boarded Flight 5568, aircraft number 3482, from Ningbo to Xiamen, where he committed the crime. At around 5:50 PM, when the plane was flying over the skies near Fuzhou, Liang Aozhen first used a knife to threaten the flight attendant to open the cockpit door, claiming he wanted to go to Keelung, Taiwan, to "tell his grievances." After being refused by the flight attendant, he then forced the flight attendant to contact the crew. When his plot was exposed, and the crew took safety measures, the plane was about to land at Fuzhou Airport. Liang Aozhen attempted to detonate detonators and explosives to destroy the plane. In a critical moment, flight attendant Zhang Liping, passengers Yu Yongyao (Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of Wan Tou Township, Jiangbei District, Ningbo City), and Lin Guoping (Deputy Secretary of the Party Branch and Chairman of the Trade Union of the Xiamen City Transportation Company) bravely subdued Liang, preventing a catastrophic plane crash. Yu and Lin were both injured in the process. Liang Aozhen died by self-detonation. The plane safely landed at Fuzhou Airport at 6:09 PM.

　　福州上空挫败一起劫机事件    
    飞机安全着陆，劫机歹徒自爆死亡
    本报福州四月二十六日电  记者张铭清报道：二十四日下午，一架中国东方航空公司运七客机，在从宁波飞往厦门途中遭一歹徒劫持。由于机组人员和旅客密切配合，歹徒阴谋被挫败，飞机安全降落在福州机场。
    现已查明，劫机者梁奥真现年二十六岁，系江西省高安县建山镇英岗岭矿务局桥头矿地下电话工。去年七月，他以“办摄影培训班”为名向全国发“招生简章”进行诈骗。今年初，当地公安机关收到各地告发信，揭露梁的诈骗行径，公安部门已对梁立案审查。四月十日，梁请假外出，于二十四日下午在宁波乘五五六八航班三四八二号飞机飞往厦门途中作案。十七时五十分左右，这架飞机飞临福州附近上空时，梁奥真先是持刀胁迫乘务员打开驾驶舱门，扬言要去台湾基隆“诉说冤屈”。在遭乘务员拒绝后，又逼迫乘务员与机组联系。在其阴谋败露，机组采取安全措施，飞机将在福州机场着陆时，梁奥真欲引爆雷管、炸药炸毁飞机。在危急关头，乘务员张丽萍，旅客余永尧（宁波市江北区湾头乡党委副书记）、林国平（厦门市交通运输公司党总支副书记、工会主席）奋不顾身，将梁犯制服，避免了一场机毁人亡的惨案。余、林两同志光荣负伤，梁奥真自爆死亡。飞机于十八时○九分安全备降在福州机场。
