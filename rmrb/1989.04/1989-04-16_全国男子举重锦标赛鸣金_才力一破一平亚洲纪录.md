The national men's weightlifting championship resounded with gold today as Cai Li, known as the "Asian Number One Strongman," showcased his prowess in the Anhui Province Tongling City Gymnasium. He broke one Asian record and tied another, while also setting three new national records.

Today's afternoon session featured the final event, the 110kg+ category. Cai Li, weighing 154.8kg and just 19 years old, attempted a 178kg snatch in his second lift, surpassing his own national record of 177.5kg. He lifted the weight effortlessly, successfully breaking the record. In less than three minutes, he lifted 180kg overhead, breaking the record again. Later, he attempted to surpass the Iranian, Rahim Ali Teymouri's Asian record of 185.5kg but fell short.

In the clean and jerk, Cai Li again demonstrated his best form. After successfully lifting 210kg on his first attempt, he went for 222.5kg on his second, already exceeding his own Asian record of 221.5kg but failed. On his third attempt, Cai Li boldly chose 225kg and, with a graceful and decisive motion, lifted the new Asian record, sending the crowd into a roar of applause. His total score of 405kg broke the national record and tied the Asian record, making him the first Chinese athlete to surpass 400kg in total weightlifting. He also secured three gold medals in this category.

With this, the six-day national men's weightlifting championship came to an end. A total of five athletes broke three Asian records and tied one, while refreshing eight national records.

The top six teams in the overall standings were: Liaoning, Shandong, PLA, Beijing, Sichuan, and Guangdong.

    至此，为时６天的全国男子举重锦标赛全部结束。共有５人打破３项亚洲纪录，平１项亚洲纪录，刷新了８项全国纪录。
