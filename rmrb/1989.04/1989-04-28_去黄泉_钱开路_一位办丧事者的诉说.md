After the Spring Festival, a middle-aged man who had just lost his father confided in me about an incident he encountered while arranging his father's funeral. It was truly a heart-wrenching experience.

He said: "My father passed away on February 13th at a hospital in Wuxi's South Gate. After his body was taken to the morgue, two female attendants said, 'It's a new year, you should show some respect!' I understood they wanted money, so I gave each of them 2.1 yuan. But they insisted on getting more than 5 yuan. I had no choice but to give each of them 5.1 yuan. The two people who helped dress him in his burial clothes also needed to be compensated, each receiving 35.1 yuan. On the morning of February 15th, the crematorium sent a hearse. The escort and the driver also demanded, 'You should show some respect!' I gave each of them 5.1 yuan, but they said, 'This is the last time, and you're still so stingy!' I gritted my teeth and gave each of them 10.1 yuan. But then they asked for cigarettes. I had to buy each of them a pack of Healthy Brand cigarettes (each pack cost 9 yuan). Watching the hearse drive away, I still couldn't relax, because the body still had to be cremated. Relatives and friends all advised me to endure it. I also thought, this is the last time, so what's the point of complaining?"

This is truly: On the path to the Yellow Springs, there are many bandits, and one does not know when one can close one's eyes in peace!

　　去黄泉　钱开路   
    ——一位办丧事者的诉说
    春节过后，一位刚刚丧父的中年汉子，向我倾诉了他在办理父亲丧事时遇到的一件无钱寸步难行的事，听来确实令人同情。
    他说：“我父亲于２月１３日病逝在无锡南门某医院，遗体送进太平间后，两个女看尸员说，‘新年新岁的，总得意思意思呀！’我明白这是要钱，于是出给每人２．１元，可她俩非要５元出头不可。我只好给每人５．１元。帮穿寿衣的两个人的酬劳更是少不了的，每人得到３５．１元。２月１５日上午，火葬场来了接尸车，押解员和驾驶员张口也要‘意思意思’，我给他们每人５．１元，他俩竟说：‘最后一次了，还这么小气，亏你拿得出手！’我咬咬牙，给他们每人１０．１元。谁知他俩收了钱又要烟，我只好又给每人买了包健牌（每包９元）香烟。看着远去的接尸车，当时我的心并未放下，因为还有尸体火化一关未过。亲戚朋友们都劝我忍一忍。我也想，最后一次了，还说什么呢？”
    这真是：此去黄泉“响马”多，不知何时能瞑目？！
