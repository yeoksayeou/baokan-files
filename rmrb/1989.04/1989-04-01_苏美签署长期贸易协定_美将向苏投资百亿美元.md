The United States and the Soviet Union signed a long-term trade agreement today. The U.S. will invest $100 billion in the Soviet Union.

MOSCOW, March 30 (Xinhua) — A U.S. commercial consortium and the Soviet Union's foreign economic consortium signed a 20-year comprehensive trade agreement in the Kremlin today.

According to the agreement, the two sides will establish more than 20 joint ventures in the fields of Soviet agriculture, energy, medicine, and petrochemicals in the coming months. The investment amount in the next few years will reach 50 billion or 100 billion rubles ($8 billion to $16 billion).
