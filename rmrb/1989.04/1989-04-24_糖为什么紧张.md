	Why Is Sugar in Short Supply?
	By Li Qi, People's Daily Reporter

	The shift from open supply to rationed supply of sugar is not due to a decrease in total production but primarily to an increase in demand. China has abundant sugar resources and great potential. The problem lies in the lack of price adjustments, which affect the production enthusiasm of farmers and sugar factory workers; meanwhile, excessive imports also impact the development of the domestic sugar industry.

	Paper, salt, and sugar, collectively known as the "three whites," all experienced shortages in 1988. Particularly, white sugar, which had been abundantly supplied for many years, suddenly became scarce. Cities implemented rationing, and many rural areas faced shortages. The situation became tense.

	The shortage of sugar is not due to a decrease in total supply

	The change from open supply to rationed supply of sugar does not mean that the state has reduced the total supply of sugar. Over the past decade, China's sugar production and supply have been increasing. From 1977 to 1986, sugar production increased from 2.08 million tons to over 5.2 million tons, a 1.53-fold increase. Although production decreased in 1988, 3.3 million tons were imported, making the total supply of sugar and industrial sugar in the national market reach over 7.8 million tons. Currently, China's total sugar production has entered the ranks of the world's top six sugar-producing countries. However, on the other hand, China's population is increasing, and people's living standards are improving. Household beverages and dishes, as well as a variety of cakes, candies, and canned goods produced by food factories, have led to a significant increase in sugar demand. The current supply of white sugar is far from meeting the needs.

	Originally, China has abundant sugar resources. The south is rich in sugarcane, and the north cultivates sugar beets. There are 12 major sugar-producing provinces; the sugar production capacity is also considerable, with over 500 mechanized sugar factories. There is great potential for developing sugar production. Given China's resource advantages and production capacity, ensuring that every household has sugar to eat is not an impossible task. Why is there still a shortage?

	Price ratios are unreasonable, farmers and sugar factories do not benefit much, affecting the enthusiasm of producers

	Although China's sugar production has developed over the years, the overall growth rate is not fast. One important reason is that prices have not been adjusted. In sugarcane-producing areas, selling a basket of sugarcane is often less profitable than selling a basket of wheat straw or rice straw; in northern China, the labor and material inputs for cultivating sugar beets are much higher than for other crops like corn, but the economic returns are lower. According to a survey by the China Construction Bank, the cost of producing one ton of sugar beets is 30.7% higher than corn, the transportation cost is 7.5 times higher, and the profit is 27% lower. The area of sugar beet cultivation has been decreasing year by year. In 1988, due to the state's price adjustment, the area of sugar beet cultivation and production slightly increased, but the semi-starved state of the sugar industry has not fundamentally improved. According to statistics from relevant departments, out of the more than 500 mechanized sugar factories nationwide, the equipment utilization rate is only 68%.

	Some sugar factory managers complain: Sugar factories provide seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and technical services to sugarcane farmers every year, investing a lot of manpower and resources, hoping to harvest more sugar materials, and run the machines at full capacity. However, the raw materials are often bought at high prices by collective and individual small factories. Coupled with insufficient coal and electricity supply and rising energy prices, the factory's losses are increasing day by day. According to the price ratio of sugar and other staple foods over the years, it is: 1 pound of white sugar : 1 pound of meat : 1 pound of eggs. In recent years, meat and eggs have been adjusted multiple times, but the price of sugar has not changed for 24 years. In 1988, the price was adjusted slightly, but sugar factories did not benefit much, and each ton of sugar produced incurs a loss of about 400 yuan.

	Small sugar factories affect large sugar factories, imported sugar affects domestic sugar

	Due to the existence of both low and high prices, small collective and individual sugar factories have sprung up everywhere in sugarcane-producing areas, competing with state-owned large sugar factories for raw materials. Neijiang in Sichuan is the largest sugar base in Southwest China. In 1987, the city built 47 small sugar factories, and in 1988, the number increased to 67. These small factories competed with the 6 large sugar factories in the area for raw materials. The small factories were step-by-step, and the large factories retreated step-by-step, with half of the equipment idle. Truckloads of sugarcane were processed into red sugar by small sugar factories with low extraction rates and poor quality. Neijiang's sugar production decreased sharply, changing from exporting to importing white sugar.

	What is even more worrying is that in recent years, China's sugar imports have been increasing at a rapid pace. According to statistics, in the 1950s, China averaged 120,000 tons of sugar imports per year, accounting for 17% of the annual domestic sugar production. In the 1960s, the average annual imports were 630,000 tons. By the first five years of the 1980s, the average annual sugar imports were 1.73 million tons, accounting for 46% of the annual domestic sugar production. By 1988, sugar imports reached 3.3 million tons, accounting for 76% of the annual domestic sugar production, using nearly $900 million in foreign exchange. According to relevant departments, the price of imported sugar is far higher than that of domestic sugar. Strangely, the state spends a large amount of money each year to import food sugar but has no money to support the development of sugar material production and the technological transformation of the sugar industry. In fact, it has formed a strange phenomenon of "selling eggs without raising chickens."

	Currently, China's sugar yield per unit area and sugar content are both very low, which are important factors restricting the development of food sugar. According to statistics from relevant departments, producing one ton of cane sugar requires 2.6 mu of land, and producing one ton of sugar beets requires 8.3 mu of land. In contrast, more advanced countries only need 1.7 mu and 3 mu, respectively. If China's sugar yield per unit area and sugar content reach the advanced level of foreign countries without increasing the cultivated land, the food sugar production can be expected to increase by nearly one fold. In recent years, China has made significant progress in this area, but due to insufficient funds for the promotion of scientific research results, many high-yield experiences and scientific research results have not been widely promoted. Experts suggest that the state should strictly control and gradually reduce the quantity of imported sugar, use the funds from imported sugar to support the development of domestic sugar, and gradually increase the proportion of domestically produced food sugar.

　　糖为什么紧张
    本报记者  李茜
    糖由敞开供应到限量，并非总供给量减少，主要是需求量增大。我国糖资源丰富，潜力很大。问题是价格关系没理顺，影响农民和糖厂职工的生产积极性；同时，过多的进口也影响到国内制糖业的发展。
    纸、盐、糖，又称“三白”，１９８８年都出现了紧张。尤其白糖，多年来供应充分，人们吃多少，买多少。去年突然紧张，城里实行凭票供应，农村不少地方缺货断档。弦，顿时绷紧了。
    糖紧张，并非总供量减少
    糖从敞开供应改为限量供应，是不是国家对于糖的总供给量减少了呢？不是。近１０年我国糖的生产与供应是不断增加的。１９７７年至１９８６年１０年间，糖的产量由２０８万吨增长到５２０多万吨，增长了１．５３倍。１９８８年下降，但进口了３３０万吨，全国市场上供应的糖和工业用糖，合计已达７８０多万吨。目前从我国食糖总产量看，已进入世界６大产糖国的行列。但另一方面，我国人口不断增加，人民生活改善，家庭饮料和菜肴，食品厂制作品种繁多的糕点、糖果和罐头，对糖的需求量倍增，现在的白糖供应量远远不能满足需要。
    本来，我国糖料资源十分丰富，南方盛产甘蔗，北方种植甜菜，主要产糖省就有１２个；制糖生产能力也颇雄厚，仅机制糖厂就有５００多个，发展糖的生产潜力很大。按照我国的资源优势和生产能力，保证家家有糖吃，并不是一件做不到的事，为什么又这样紧张呢？
    比价不合理，农民和糖厂得不到多少实惠，影响了生产者的积极性
    我国食糖生产多年来虽有发展，但总的说增长速度不快，一个重要原因是价格未能理顺。在甘蔗产区，常常卖一担甘蔗还不如一担麦秸或一担稻草；在我国北方，种植甜菜的投工、投料等支出，远比玉米等农作物高，而经济收入却低于这些作物。据中国建设银行调查，每吨甜菜的工本费比玉米高３０．７％，运费高７．５倍，利润则低２７％。糖料种植面积连年下降，１９８８年由于国家调整了价格，种植面积和产量略有回升，但制糖工业半饥半饱的状况并未根本改善。据有关部门统计，全国５００多家机制定点糖厂，设备利用率只有６８％。
    一些糖厂的厂长诉苦：糖厂每年为蔗农提供种子、化肥、农药和技术服务，投入很多人力和资金，盼望多收些糖料，机器开足马力生产，但原料往往被集体、个体小厂高价收走，加上煤电供应不足，能源价格一涨再涨，工厂亏损额与日俱增。按照多年来糖和其它副食品的比价是：１斤白糖∶１斤肉∶１斤蛋；这几年肉蛋多次调价，而糖的价格２４年不变，１９８８年价格调整了一些，糖厂并未得到多少实惠，每生产一吨糖亏４００元左右。
    小糖厂影响了大糖厂，进口糖影响了国产糖
    由于平价、高价两种价格的存在，甘蔗产区到处兴建集体与个体小糖厂，与国营大型糖厂开展了原料之战。四川内江是我国西南最大的糖业基地，１９８７年全市建起４７个小糖厂，１９８８年增加到６７家。这些小厂与当地６个大糖厂展开争夺原料战，小厂步步为营，大厂则节节败退，设备一半闲置。一车车甘蔗被出糖率低、质量差的小糖厂榨制了红糖，内江市糖产量锐减，由历来外运变为调进白糖。
    尤其使人忧虑的是，近几年我国进口糖正以跳跃速度增长。据统计，５０年代我国平均每年进口糖１２万吨，占国内年平均产糖量的１７％；６０年代年平均进口６３万吨；到８０年代前５年平均年进口糖为１７３万吨，占国内年平均产糖量的４６％。到１９８８年进口糖达３３０万吨，占国内年产糖量的７６％，耗用外汇近９亿美元。据有关部门谈，进口糖价远远高于国产糖价格。奇怪的是，国家每年耗用大量资金进口食糖，却无钱扶持糖料生产的发展和制糖工业的技术改造，实际上形成了只卖蛋不养鸡的怪现象。
    目前我国糖料单产与含糖量都很低，这是制约食糖发展的重要因素。据有关部门统计，我国每吨蔗糖需耕地２．６亩，每吨甜菜需耕地８．３亩，而国外较先进的国家只需１．７亩和３亩，如果我国糖料单产和含糖度达到国外先进水平，在不增加耕地的情况下，食糖产量可望增加近一倍。近几年我国这方面的科研工作取得了可喜进展，但由于科研成果推广经费不足，不少高产经验和科研成果未能大面积推广。专家们建议，国家要严格控制和逐步减少进口糖的数量，用进口糖的资金扶持国产糖的发展，逐步增加食糖国产化的比重。
