    Husband and Wife Learn to Read
    In Taiping Town, Beigang Village, Zou County, Shandong Province, farmer Shao Yumei has worked with fellow villagers to combat poverty and achieve prosperity. She has been honored more than 30 times by the All-China Women's Federation and various levels of provincial, municipal, and county leadership, becoming a local celebrity. In recent years, this 45-year-old woman, who has never set foot in a school, has increasingly felt the burden of illiteracy. Starting last year, she began studying with her husband as her teacher.
