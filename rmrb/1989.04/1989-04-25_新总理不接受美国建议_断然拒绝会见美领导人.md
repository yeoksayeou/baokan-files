New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange, currently visiting the United States, today firmly rejected a U.S. suggestion that he abandon his anti-nuclear stance in exchange for a meeting with U.S. government leaders.

Lange was interviewed by the American National Broadcasting Company in New Haven, Connecticut. He said that the U.S. government had "very frankly" proposed that "(Lange) going to Washington would cost the U.S. allowing American nuclear warships to enter New Zealand ports." Lange said, "This policy is not acceptable to New Zealanders."

An official from the New Zealand Embassy in the U.S. confirmed to our reporter that Lange arrived in the U.S. on April 22 for an "official visit," but he will not go to Washington. So far, Lange has not met with any officials from the Bush administration, nor are there any plans for such meetings.

　　新总理不接受美国建议  断然拒绝会见美领导人
    据新华社华盛顿４月２４日电（记者怀成波）正在美国访问的新西兰总理戴维·朗伊今天断然拒绝美国方面要他放弃反核立场、以换取会见美国政府领导人的建议。
    朗伊在康涅狄格州的纽黑文接受了美国全国广播公司的电视采访。他说，美国政府“非常直言不讳”地提出，“（朗伊）到华盛顿的代价是让美国核军舰进入新西兰港口”。朗伊说，“这种政策我们新西兰人是不接受的。”
    新西兰驻美大使馆的一位官员向本社记者证实，朗伊４月２２日抵达美国进行“正式访问”，但他将不来华盛顿。朗伊迄今还未会见布什政府的任何官员，也没有类似的计划安排。
