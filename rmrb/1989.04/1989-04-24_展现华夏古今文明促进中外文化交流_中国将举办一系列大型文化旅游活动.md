Foreign visitors to China are no longer satisfied with just enjoying natural scenery. The China International Cultural Tourism Company has emerged in response to this trend. The company aims to organize tourism activities with distinct cultural features, integrating tourism and culture to showcase the brilliance of Chinese civilization past and present, and to promote cultural exchanges between Chinese and foreign citizens. Currently, the company is in negotiations with American magician Mark Wilson, the "International Opera Festival," and other individuals and civic groups to hold a series of large-scale cultural tourism activities during China's peak tourism season.

The bright spring of the Year of the Snake has brought the tourism season early. The China International Cultural Tourism Company has invited a dance troupe of 10 American women over 62 years old, known as the "Young Hearts Dance Troupe," to perform tap dancing in China, as well as Steven Kramer, who successfully portrayed Officer McCall, to perform rock music and other artistic activities, adding to the enjoyment of Chinese and foreign tourists.

The company's director revealed that the most attractive projects will be in the coming two years. One is the "International Magic Festival" featuring Mark Wilson and his son, along with over a thousand famous magicians from around the world. The other is a performance of the opera "Turandot" by renowned Italian composer Giacomo Puccini, starring world-famous singers, to be held at the Forbidden City in Beijing. The opera "Turandot," which has captivated Europe and America for half a century with its enchanting, beautiful story and rich Chinese flavor, is based on a Chinese myth. The China International Cultural Tourism Company and the "International Opera Festival" will bring this myth to life at the Forbidden City, its place of origin, in 1991. At that time, audiences will be immersed in the grandeur of the Palace Museum; the spectacle will be as magnificent and lively as the performance of Verdi's immortal opera "Aida" at the Luxor Temple in Egypt.

China's tourism industry is still young. Among the thriving industry peers, the China International Cultural Tourism Company stands out. This company, primarily composed of cultural professionals, not only organizes cultural tourism activities for all self-funded cultural and artistic groups and individuals visiting China but also provides traditional and modern art performances and exhibitions for tourists during their travels. The company will organize receptions for high-level, academically oriented cultural tourism groups and experts visiting China to engage in unique ancient culture observations, academic seminars, and cultural and artistic exchanges.

　　展现华夏古今文明促进中外文化交流    
    中国将举办一系列大型文化旅游活动
    本报讯  记者赖仁琼报道：来华的外国游客不满足于欣赏自然景观，中国国际文化旅游公司应运而生。该公司旨在举办突出文化特色的旅游活动，融旅游和文化为一体，以展现华夏古今灿烂文明，促进中外民间文化交流。目前，该公司正与美国魔术师马克·威尔逊、“国际歌剧节”等个人和民间团体协商，将在我国旅游旺季举办一系列大型文化旅游活动。
    蛇年的明媚春光使旅游旺季提前到来。中国国际文化旅游公司邀请由１０名６２岁以上的美国老年妇人组成的“年轻的心灵舞蹈团”来华表演踢踏舞、成功扮演麦考尔警官的斯蒂文·克莱默来华表演摇滚乐等艺术活动，为中外游客增添情趣。
    该公司负责人透露，最富吸引力的项目当数明、后两年的活动。一是马克·威尔逊父子及其邀请的世界上千名著名魔术师来华表演的“国际魔术节”，二是由世界著名歌唱家在北京紫禁城搭台上演意大利作曲家普契尼的歌剧《杜兰朵》。以离奇、优美的故事和浓郁的中国特色风靡欧美半个世纪的歌剧《杜兰朵》，是享誉全球的意大利作曲家普契尼描写的一个中国神话。中国国际文化旅游公司和“国际歌剧节”将于１９９１年把这个神话搬到故事发源地紫禁城上演。届时，游客观众将置身于辉煌壮丽的故宫；其场面之壮观热烈，可以想象，绝不会比当年在埃及卢克索神庙演出威尔第的不朽歌剧《阿依达》逊色。
    我国旅游业还很年轻。在蓬勃发展的同行业中，中国国际文化旅游公司一枝独秀。这个以文化人为主体的公司除为一切自费来华的文化艺术团体、个人举办文化旅游活动外，还将为游客在旅行中承办传统和现代艺术节目的演出、展览，组织接待高层次的、带有学术性、研究性的文化旅游团体和专家名人来华进行具有特色的古文化观摩、学术座谈以及文化艺术研讨等旅游活动。
