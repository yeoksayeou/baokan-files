Almost the entire period of the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression, my father spent in Guangxi. The Guangxi opera "The Peach Blossom Fan" was often rehearsed during air raid alerts. My mother helped in the cave by painting the backdrops and designing costumes and headpieces. She also built a stone stove to cook meals for everyone. Although "The Peach Blossom Fan" is about the fall of the Southern Ming Dynasty 300 years ago, its sharp edge pointed at the Wang Jingwei puppet government and the reactionary forces that were cowardly in the face of external enemies but fierce in internal strife, corrupt and brutal.

In the play, Li Xiangjun, though a fallen woman, loves her country and upholds loyalty and righteousness. She was fortunate to meet "a kindred spirit in the dusty world" Hou Zhongxi, and she devoted herself to him, remaining faithful. After Hou Zhongxi was forced to leave by the powerful officials, it was Yang Wenchong, who had previously arranged the match between Hou and Li, who now forced Li Xiangjun to remarry to a corrupt official. Li Xiangjun angrily rebuked him, saying, "Do you make a living from your writings or from matchmaking?!" Li Xiangjun refused to remarry, hitting her head until it bled, and her blood flowed onto the fan they had exchanged as a token of their love. Yang, however, proudly painted the blood into a peach blossom on the fan. Li Xiangjun's friend Zheng Tuonian mocked him, saying, "Others hit their heads and bleed, and you use it for amusement, how..." Yang replied, "Those generals write their glory with the blood of thousands of people, how is that different from me?" Whenever these scenes were performed, especially when Li Xiangjun denounced the powerful officials, the audience would always applaud enthusiastically. Even during air raid alerts, audiences would line up to buy tickets to watch the play. In 1939, Tian Han wrote a poem for the Guangxi opera "The Peach Blossom Fan": "Endless entanglements break the heart of the traveler, the spring rain in Guilin is like that in Xiaoxiang. Those who sing well often admire Liu Sanmei, and it is fitting to sing Li Xiangjun's new tune."

After liberation, the play "The Peach Blossom Fan" was performed again on stage as both a spoken drama and a Peking opera. In 1956, one of the graduation performances of the Central Academy of Drama's directing training class was the spoken drama "The Peach Blossom Fan." The class was led by the famous female director Sun Weishi, and the director was the Soviet expert Lesli. Li Xiangjun and Hou Zhongxi were played by Zuo Xiaolin and Xiong Bingxun. A Jia played Liu Jingting, and Tian Chong played Su Kunsheng; Geng Zheng played Yang Wenchong, Ling Jianru played Li Zhenli, He Zhaozhi played Zheng Tuonian, Pan Yu played Kou Baimen, Zhu Lan played Bian Yujing, Liu Ling played Chen Dingsheng, Li Jun played Wu Qicai, Li Ding played Yuan Dachui, etc. This performance was an attempt at scientific research in the art of directing. My father believed that when presenting historical themes in the form of spoken drama, one could learn from the essence of foreign directing art, but must respect the national customs and habits of China. For example, the way Hou Zhongxi carried Li Xiangjun, who had died of anger, was obviously not in line with the customs of the late Ming Dynasty.

In 1958, my father, at the request of the China Peking Opera House, revised the Peking opera "The Peach Blossom Fan" again. It was performed by Du Jinfang and Ye Shenglan. Du Jinfang recalled: "Old Ouyang took two months to revise the script. At that time, Old Ouyang was ill, and I felt sorry for him. I think Li Xiangjun is lovable. She is a patriot, rising above the mud but not stained. However, her heart is as high as the sky, but her fate is as thin as paper. In the final scene, she finally saw her beloved Hou Zhongxi, and she was overcome with joy and sorrow. But Hou Zhongxi's betrayal took away her last hope and life."

There are different opinions among experts on whether Hou Zhongxi is praised or criticized. But drama is not a historical work. The characters in the play do not necessarily conform to historical truth. On June 23, 1964, at the Peking opera modern drama observation and performance conference, Premier Zhou said: "Ouyang, in his later years, still overturned the case of Hou Zhongxi, denying Hou Zhongxi, which was very courageous."

During the ten years of turmoil, "The Peach Blossom Fan," a play that advocated national spirit, praised loyalty and unyieldingness, and opposed betrayal and surrender, and was welcomed by the masses, became a target for criticizing traitors and philosophical issues. At that time, it was not surprising that people and demons were confused, and right and wrong were not distinguished. Although human history is full of twists and turns, I believe it will ultimately move forward forever. The peach blossoms in spring shine with bright dew, and with a respectful heart, I offer flowers to the revolutionary forerunners, experts, and scholars who have promoted the progress of history, and to the great Chinese people.

　　桃花依旧笑春风
　　——写于父亲欧阳予倩诞辰一百周年
　　欧阳敬如
    几乎整个抗战时期父亲都在广西度过。桂剧《桃花扇》经常是在空袭警报时间排练的。母亲在岩洞中帮着画布景、设计服装头饰。她还架起石块烧火做饭给大家吃。虽然《桃花扇》演的是３００年前南明王朝覆灭时期的故事，但锋芒却指向汪精卫汉奸政府，以及外敌当前不敢抵抗却勇于内争、腐败残暴的反动势力。
    剧中李香君虽沦为歌女，但她爱国家、崇尚忠义。她有幸遇到了“风尘中的知己”侯朝宗，便委身于他，忠贞不渝。侯朝宗被权奸逼走后，就是那个为侯、李撮合的杨文聪反过来又逼李香君另嫁贪官。香君怒斥他说：“你是靠文章吃饭还是靠作媒为生？！”香君拚死不肯另嫁，将头碰破，鲜血流在定情的扇上，杨却自鸣风雅地将美人的鲜血在扇上画成一枝桃花。香君的好友郑妥娘讽刺他说：“人家碰头流血，你拿来开心取乐，未免……”杨答道：“那些大将军们把千万人的鲜血写成一个人的功劳簿，比我怎么样？”每当演到这些地方和香君痛斥权奸时，台下总报以热烈的掌声。观众甚至乘空袭警报的间歇时间排队买票看戏。田汉老在１９３９年为桂剧《桃花扇》赋诗一首：“无限缠绵断客肠，桂林春雨似潇湘。善歌常羡刘三妹，端合新声唱李香。”
    解放后，《桃花扇》话剧和京剧又出现在舞台上。１９５６年中央戏剧学院导演干部训练班毕业演出的剧目之一是话剧《桃花扇》。班主任是著名女导演孙维世，导演是苏联专家列斯里。李香君、侯朝宗由左筱林、熊秉勋扮演。阿甲演柳敬亭，田冲演苏昆生；耿正演杨文聪，凌琯如演李贞丽，贺昭饰郑妥娘，潘予演寇白门，珠岚饰卞玉京，刘玲饰陈定生，黎军饰吴次尾，李丁饰阮大铖等。这次演出是进行表导演艺术科学研究的一次尝试。父亲认为以话剧形式表现历史题材时，可以借鉴外国表、导演艺术的精华，但必须尊重我国的民族风俗习惯。譬如让侯朝宗把气厥而殒的李香君抱托起来的处理办法，显然是与明末时期的风俗极不相符的。
    １９５８年父亲应中国京剧院的要求，重新整理京剧《桃花扇》。由杜近芳和叶盛兰主演。杜近芳回忆说：欧阳老用两个月时间改好了剧本。当时欧阳老有病，我心疼。我觉得李香君可爱。她是个爱国者，出污泥而不染。但是她心比天高，命比纸薄。最后一场戏，她终于见到了心爱的人侯朝宗，悲喜交加。但侯朝宗的背叛夺走了她最后的希望和生命。
    对于侯朝宗是褒是贬，专家们有不同的看法。但戏剧究竟不是历史著作。剧中人物未必完全符合历史真实。１９６４年６月２３日，周总理在京剧现代戏观摩演出大会上讲话时说：“欧阳到晚年还把侯朝宗翻案，否定侯朝宗，很有勇气。”
    在十年浩劫中，《桃花扇》这样一个宣扬民族气节、赞颂忠贞不屈、反对卖国投降，受到广大群众欢迎的戏，竟成了批判叛徒，哲学的靶子。那时人妖颠倒、是非不分确也不足为怪。人类的历史虽然坎坷曲折，但我相信终究是永远向前发展的。春天的桃花闪烁着晶莹的露珠，我怀着崇敬的心情将鲜花献给推动历史前进的革命先辈、专家学者、伟大的中国人民。　　　　（下）
