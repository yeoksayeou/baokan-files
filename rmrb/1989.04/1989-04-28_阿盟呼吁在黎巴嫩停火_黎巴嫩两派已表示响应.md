The Arab League today issued a call for a ceasefire in Lebanon starting from 12:00 noon (local time) on April 28, lifting all blockades on sea, land, and air facilities, and opening all passages for a period of three months. The League also proposed the establishment of an Arab ceasefire monitoring force.

The third special session of the Arab League Council of Ministers also urged the United Nations Security Council, particularly its permanent members, to fulfill their responsibilities in implementing Resolution 425 regarding the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanese territory.

The resolution reaffirmed the commitment to maintaining Lebanon's unity, independence, sovereignty, and Arab identity in terms of territory, people, and institutions. It stipulated that the representatives of the chairman of the Arab Committee for the Settlement of the Lebanese Crisis and the secretary-general of the Arab League would, in cooperation with the relevant parties in Lebanon, implement the final solution to the Lebanese problem. These two representatives would also be responsible for supervising the ceasefire and would have the necessary privileges to carry out their duties.

The resolution also approved the committee's proposal to form an observer group with a three-month term, with expenses to be borne by the member states of the Arab League.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Beirut on April 28, both factions in Lebanon have issued statements in response to the Arab League's ceasefire call.

Lebanese Christian militia leader General Michel Aoun issued a statement on April 27 supporting the Arab League's ceasefire call, while also demanding that the Arab League pressure Syria to withdraw its troops from Lebanon. Lebanese Muslim Prime Minister Selim al-Hoss also issued a statement, pledging cooperation with the Arab monitoring force to end the fighting.
