Beijing Longtan Park has successfully implemented the concept of "self-sustaining park management" since 1987.

Beijing Longtan Park was established a few years ago on the foundation of the original Longtan Lake, becoming a scenic garden with both classical Northern Chinese and modern features. However, since its opening in 1986, the park has relied on an annual government subsidy of 3 to 4 million yuan, leaving the park with insufficient funds for development.

In 1987, Beijing Longtan Park signed an economic contract with the district's park management bureau, initiating bold reforms. They first implemented a contract system for the park's three departments, one office, and four teams. Economic activities were managed under a contract responsibility system, and bonuses were distributed based on a "three-level, nine-grade" system. They established and improved 20 management regulations. The contracted tasks were broken down layer by layer, with rewards for hard work and penalties for laziness, thereby motivating the staff. On this basis, they actively developed various activities to increase revenue. The 300-acre water surface is a significant advantage of the park. They prepared hundreds of rowboats, motorboats, dragon boats, and other vessels for visitors. In winter, they organized various attractive ice activities. On land, they added bumper cars, small trains, and children's amusement rides. To ensure visitors have a good time, they added dozens of commercial services such as fast food, cold drinks, souvenirs, and photography. They also organized seasonal events like the "Spring Festival Longtan Temple Fair," "Dragon Boat Race," "Summer Evening Party," and "Chongyang Festival Garden Party." Over the past three years, the park has welcomed over 10 million visitors, providing convenient cultural and recreational activities for the residents of Beijing's southern district and achieving significant environmental, social, and economic benefits.

By the end of 1988, the park had generated 1.2 million yuan in revenue, essentially achieving the goal of "self-sustaining park management." With funds in hand, they gained the ability to develop independently. Over the past three years, they invested approximately 500,000 yuan in fixed assets, constructing three new boat docks and five greenhouses. They also added nearly 300 new boats and photography equipment and amusement facilities. Currently, the park has over 60,000 trees and six unique scenic spots, including the Dragon Character Stele Forest, Longtan Waterfall, Longting, and Longmen. With time, they will continue to beautify the park.

　　北京龙潭公园以园养园
    本报讯　北京龙潭公园自１９８７年以来大胆改革，终于实现了“以园养园”的设想。
    北京龙潭公司是在原龙潭湖的基础上，几年前建成的具有我国北方典雅和现代特色的风景秀丽的园林公园。但从１９８６年开放后，一年要靠国家拨给三四十万元过日子，园林建设资金非常紧缺。
    １９８７年北京龙潭公园与区园林局签订了经费承包合同，进行了大胆的改革。首先，他们对园内三科一室四队的干部实行了聘任制；经济活动实行承包责任制；奖金分配上实行“三岗九等”制；建立健全了２０项管理制度。承包任务指标层层分解，奖勤罚懒，调动了职工的积极性。在这个基础上，通过开展各项活动，努力创收。３００亩水面是公园的一大优势，他们为游人准备了几百条手划船、电动船、龙船等，冬季则举办各种吸引人的冰上活动。在陆地上他们增加了碰碰车、小火车、儿童游乐等。为让游人玩好，还增添了快餐、冷饮、纪念品、照像等数十个商业服务设施。他们不失时机按季举办“春节龙潭庙会”、“龙舟大赛”、“消夏晚会”、“九·九重阳节游园会”。３年来，这个公园共接待游人１０００多万人次，为首都南城地区居民的业余文化生活创造了便利条件，也使公园在环境效益、社会效益、经济效益上都取得明显的收获。
    截至１９８８年底，公园完成收入１２０万元，基本实现了“以园养园”的目标。手里有了钱，就有了自我发展能力。３年来，他们在固定资产上投资约５０万元，新建了３个游船码头、５间花房，还添置了近３００条新船以及照像器材和游乐设施。目前，公园有树木６万余株，龙字碑林、龙潭瀑布、龙亭、龙门等具有独特风格的景点６处。随着时间的推移，他们会把公园装点得更美。
