The editor's note: The head of the engineering technology department at New York City Technical College, Horowitz, believes that "engineering knowledge lasts 10 years, and technical knowledge lasts 2 to 5 years." With the rapid development of contemporary science and technology, the aging and updating of knowledge have become increasingly urgent issues. In our country, the outdated notion of "one diploma, lifetime use" needs to be updated first. Following the publication of Yu Yiqun's "Continuing Engineering Education Abroad" in the previous issue of the international education and culture page, we are publishing this article by Ruǎn Liánsān to help readers understand the importance of this issue from different perspectives.

	The era of one-time education has ended

Since the 1960s, science and technology have been advancing rapidly, and continuing engineering education has emerged and gained increasing attention from various countries.

In the past, people's traditional notion was to divide a person's life into two stages: learning and working. Once a person graduates from college, it was thought that the learning stage was completed. Due to the development of science and technology, this era has long passed. Someone has calculated that a person, upon graduating from college, actually only learns 10% of the knowledge needed for the next few decades, and the remaining 90% of the knowledge must be acquired through work and learning. Thus, some people have proposed concepts such as "knowledge obsolescence rate" and "knowledge half-life." Some have conducted surveys and research, providing relatively objective views. For example, Horowitz, the head of the engineering technology department at New York City Technical College, believes: "Mathematical and scientific knowledge (foundational knowledge) is useful for life, engineering knowledge lasts 10 years, and technical knowledge lasts 2-5 years." Professor Meyer of the University of Sydney believes: "Frontier scientific and technological knowledge will have 50% discarded every 3-5 years." Zerekov of the United States surveyed and statistically analyzed the curriculum of the electrical engineering department since 1935 and found that by 1969, only 5% of the 1935 curriculum was usable, with an obsolescence rate of 2.8% per year. However, by 1969, 45% of the 1960 curriculum was unusable, with an obsolescence rate of 5% per year. By 1982, the obsolescence rate had reached 9-10% per year.

	Ultimately, it is a competition for talent

The development of science and technology has led to the emergence of many interdisciplinary engineering fields, and the widespread use of computers has brought about a series of changes in engineering work and its management. Engineering and technical personnel must constantly expand their knowledge base and even learn knowledge from completely unfamiliar disciplines. In fact, the fierce competition in the global market is essentially a competition in science and technology, ultimately a competition for talent.

With the development of science and technology, the structure of technical forces must be adjusted accordingly, and the ratio of engineers to workers is gradually increasing, leading to an increasing demand for engineers. Therefore, on the one hand, it is necessary to strengthen the training of existing engineers to maintain their creative vitality and improve work efficiency. On the other hand, it is necessary to accelerate the training of outstanding workers and technicians to become engineers.

The problem is more pronounced in the United States. On the one hand, the engineers trained by the United States after World War II have largely reached retirement age. On the other hand, the number of engineering graduates from universities is decreasing each year. Except for a few specialties such as aerospace, the number of graduates in various specialties has been continuously declining since 1970. It is estimated that from now until 2005, the United States will have a long-term shortage of engineers, and the only solution is to strengthen "continuing engineering education."

The development of science and technology has made many countries feel that universities are lagging too far behind the times, and graduates are not useful. Now, many countries are carrying out educational reforms to try to make school education adapt to the needs of society. However, due to the long cycle of education and the rapid development and change of science and technology, even after reforms, there will still be a certain degree of maladaptation, which can only be remedied by continuing engineering education.

	People are a resource that must be developed

Education is a business that invests near and sees effects far, and its benefits cannot be directly manifested in the short term. "Continuing engineering education" is no exception.

The National Science Foundation of the United States conducted a survey, selecting 400 out of 4000 engineers from four high-tech enterprises for long-term tracking, using four aspects of change as evaluation indicators: personal income, job promotion, number of published papers, and number of patent applications. Since 1978, they have conducted surveys every three years and found that continuing engineering education has played a decisive role.

"Continuing engineering education" has not only become a part of the entire education system but also a part of cadre personnel work. Some developed countries, such as the United States, have successively changed their personnel departments to human resources departments, precisely because they recognize that "people" are a resource that can be developed and must be developed. In the past, the personnel department only passively "managed" "people," but now they recognize that they must train and educate "people" to improve and develop human potential. In the era of a new technological revolution, the use of people must be combined with continuous training to maintain and develop the business in the face of fierce competition.

### 也谈继续工程教育

　　也谈继续工程教育
    阮莲三
    编者按美国纽约市技术学院工程技术部主任霍罗伟认为，“工程知识管１０年，技术知识管２至５年。”随着当代科技日新月异的发展，知识的老化与更新是一个愈益紧迫的重要课题。在我国首先需更新的是“一张文凭，终身享用”的陈旧观念。我们继上期国际文教专页发表余逸群同志的《国外的继续工程教育》之后，再发表阮莲三同志的这篇文章，以期帮助读者从不同方面了解此问题的重要性。
　　一次性的教育已结束　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    自６０年代以来，世界科技日新月异，继续工程教育应运而生，且日益受到各国的重视。
    以往，人们的传统的观念是把人的一生分为学习和工作两个阶段。一个人大学毕业，就可认为学习阶段已经完成。由于科学技术的发展，这种时代早已过去。有人统计，一个人在大学毕业时，实际上只学到了他今后几十年所需要的知识的１０％，其余９０％的知识，还要边工作边学习获得。于是有人提出“知识陈旧率”和“知识半衰期”等等。有人还作了调查研究，提出了比较客观的看法。如美国纽约市技术学院工程技术部主任霍罗伟认为：“数理知识（基础知识）终身有用，工程知识管十年，技术知识管２—５年”。澳大利亚悉尼大学教授迈塞尔认为：“前沿科学技术知识，每３—５年就会有５０％被废弃不用”。美国的泽里可夫调查和统计了１９３５年以来电机系的课程，发现１９３５年所教的课程，到１９６９年只有５％可用，陈旧率为每年２．８％。但是１９６０年的课程到１９６９年就有４５％不能用了，陈旧率为每年５％。而到１９８２年，陈旧率就达到每年９—１０％了。
    归根结底是人才竞争
    科学技术的发展，出现了许多跨学科专业的工程，计算机的广泛应用，又引起工程工作及其管理的一系列变化。工程技术人员必须经常扩大他的知识面，甚至要学习他完全生疏的其他学科的知识。事实上，世界市场的激烈竞争，实质上是科技的竞争，归根结底是人才的竞争。
    随着科技的发展，技术力量的结构必须作相应的调整，工程师、技术员对工人的比例在逐步增大，工程师的数量要求也因而日益增加。因此，一方面要对现有工程师加强培训，使他们保持创造的活力，提高工作效率，同时要加紧把工人和技术员中的优秀者培养成工程师。
    美国这方面的问题更为突出。一方面，美国在第二次大战后培养的工程师已大量到达退休年龄。另一方面，大学工科毕业生每年减少。除航空、航天等少数专业外，各专业自１９７０年以来，人数持续下降。预计，从现在起到２００５年，美国将会有一个较长时间缺少工程师，出路只能是加强“继续工程教育”。
    科学技术的发展，使各国普遍感到大学落后于时代太多，毕业生不好用。现在不少国家都在进行教育改革，力图使学校教育适应社会的需要。但是由于教育的周期较长，而科学技术的发展变化很快，即使改革了也总会存在一定程度的不适应，只能用继续工程教育的办法加以补救。
    人是必须开发的资源
    教育是一种近投资远见效的事业，其效益不可能直接在短时间内表现出来。“继续工程教育”亦不例外。
    美国国家科学基金会作了一项调研，从四个高技术企业的４０００名工程师中选了４００名作长期跟踪调查，以四个方面的变化作为评价指标：个人收入数、职位升迁情况、发表专文数和申请专利数。自１９７８年以来每三年调查一次，他们发现继续工程教育起了决定性的作用。
    “继续工程教育”不仅成为整个教育体系的一部分，而且也已成为干部人事工作的一部分。一些发达国家如美国，纷纷将其人事部门改为人力资源部门，就是因为认识到“人”是一种可以开发、也必须开发的“资源”。过去人事部门只是消极地“管理”“人”，现在认识到必须对“人”进行培训教育，提高和发挥人的潜力。在新技术革命时代，人的使用必须与不断培训相结合，才能在激烈的竞争中，使事业常盛不衰并不断发展。
