	China's first 300,000-kilowatt nuclear power plant steam generator has been manufactured in Shanghai. Yesterday, the China National Nuclear Corporation, on behalf of the state, issued a production permit to the Shanghai Boiler Factory, marking the end of China's history of being unable to produce key nuclear power equipment.

	Among the four key pieces of equipment for the 300,000-kilowatt Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant, the steam generator is the most complex and the most difficult to manufacture. Currently, only a few countries, including the United States, West Germany, and France, have the capability to produce it. The nuclear power steam generator produced by the Shanghai Boiler Factory was designed by the Shanghai Nuclear Engineering Research Institute. It has a maximum outer diameter of 3.8 meters, a total height of 18 meters, a wall thickness of 87 millimeters, and a total capacity of 208 tons.

    核电蒸发器问世    
    生产许可证在沪颁发
    本报上海四月二十三日电  我国第一台三十万千瓦核电站的蒸发器在上海制成。中国核工业总公司昨天代表国家向上海锅炉厂颁发了生产许可证，从而结束了我国不能生产核电关键设备的历史。
    秦山三十万千瓦核电站四大关键设备中，蒸发器是最复杂、制造难度最大的设备。目前，只有美国、西德、法国等少数国家能制造。上海锅炉厂生产的这台核电蒸发器是由上海核工程研究院设计的，最大外径为三点八米，总高十八米，壁体厚度八十七毫米，总容量二百零八吨。
