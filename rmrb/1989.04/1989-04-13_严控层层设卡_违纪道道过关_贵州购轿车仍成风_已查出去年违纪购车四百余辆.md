	Since last year, some party and government departments in Guizhou have used various illegal and unethical means to purchase and resell small cars. Currently, the province has identified 451 small cars purchased illegally last year. The Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government have ordered relevant supervisory departments to conduct thorough investigations and strict punishments to maintain the integrity of party and government agencies.

	According to the Provincial Supervision Bureau on April 10, due to the lax management by relevant departments and financial authorities over vehicle planning, allocation, control, registration, and financial audits, some units have exploited these loopholes. The relevant departments of the Provincial Planning Commission have been lax in managing the allocation of small cars, leaving 50 vehicles as a flexible reserve last year. The control departments have also been out of control. The Provincial Control Office approved 478 non-production-use small cars last year, with over 100 of them being off-plan purchases. Some vehicle management units have been chaotic. Since the second half of 1987, the province has approved over 500 cars for registration without control procedures. Some financial management departments have been lax in auditing funds for illegal car purchases, with cases of misappropriating special funds, loans, and bank loans to buy cars occurring frequently.

	The chaos in management has allowed some units and individuals to abuse their power, engage in illegal buying and selling, and profit from it. Zhang Feifei, a reporter from the Guizhou Provincial Radio Station's Advertising Department, was arrested by the public security authorities. From April to October last year, he illegally purchased 45 used cars and complete sets of parts from the "Wuzhou Car Disassembly Plant" jointly operated by the Guangxi Foreign Trade Corporation and the Hong Kong Yongfeng Trade Company. Of these, 38 cars sold within Guizhou Province were all cash transactions. The Public Security Bureau of Guiyang City acquired 17 cars, some of which were paid for in cash and equipped with police lights and plates, driven back from Guangxi as whole vehicles; some were transported back as parts and assembled at provided locations. Among these, 8 cars were resold at a higher price by Administrative Director Zhang Shengkai and others, earning over 200,000 yuan. The Guizhou Provincial Armed Police Corps purchased 13 cars, providing bank accounts, large sums of cash, loading locations, and police car transportation for Zhang Feifei's resale. They also handled the "small car retirement file" registration procedures for Zhang's resale cars, collecting fees into a small treasury. Additionally, the Armed Police Corps resold 2 small cars to the Guizhou Provincial Public Security Bureau at a higher price, earning over 30,000 yuan. Currently, this case involving over 20 units and more than 30 people from 6 provinces and 1 municipality is under investigation.

	For small cars purchased in violation of regulations, relevant provincial departments have conducted serious investigations and punishments. For the chaos in small car planning and control management, the Provincial Government has ordered the taxation, finance, and price departments to conduct in-depth investigations and serious handling. To strengthen the management of small car planning and social group purchases, the Provincial Government will issue and implement new regulations.

    严控层层设卡　违纪道道过关
　　贵州购轿车仍成风
　　已查出去年违纪购车四百余辆
    新华社贵阳4月11日电　（记者陈云珍）去年以来，贵州一些党政部门采取种种违纪违法手段购买、倒卖小汽车。目前，全省已查出去年违纪购买的小汽车451辆。省委、省政府要求各监督部门从严深入查处，以维护党政机关的廉洁。
    据省监察厅4月10日介绍，由于有关管理部门和财经部门对车辆的计划分配、控购、上户、资金审查管理不严，使违纪违法购车的单位钻了空子。省计委有关业务部门在小汽车计划分配上掌握不严，去年计划内留作机动安排的达50辆。控购部门失控的情况也十分严重。省控办去年批准办理的非生产用小汽车达478辆，属于计划外批购的就有100多辆。一些车辆管理单位管理也很混乱，全省自1987年下半年以来，无控购手续批准上户的汽车就达500多辆。某些财经管理部门对违纪购车的资金审查不严，挪用专款、借款和贷款购买小车屡有发生。
    管理环节上的混乱，使少数单位和个人利用职权，倒买倒卖，从中渔利。已被公安机关收审的贵州省人民广播电台广告科记者张非非去年4月至10月，从广西进出口贸易公司与香港永丰贸易公司联办的“梧州拆车厂”非法购进旧轿车和成套散件共45辆，其中倒卖在贵州省内的38辆车均为现金交易。贵阳市公安局从中购得17辆车，除直接用现金支付外，有的还装警灯、挂警牌，从广西开回整车；有的运回散件并提供地点进行组装。其中有8辆车由这个局行政处长张升凯等人加价倒卖，获利20多万元。贵州省武警总队购买了13辆车，竟为张非非倒卖车辆提供银行帐户、巨额现金、装车地点和警车运输。还为张倒卖车辆办理“小汽车退役档案”入户手续，收取手续费入小金库。此外，武警总队还加价转卖给贵州省公安厅2辆小汽车，获利3万余元。目前，这一涉及6省1市的20多个单位、30多人的案件正在侦查中。
    对违反规定购买的小汽车，省有关部门已经进行了认真查处。对小汽车计划和控购管理上的混乱问题，省政府责成税收、财务、物价等部门进行深入调查，严肃处理。为了加强对小汽车计划和社会集团购买控制管理，省政府将颁布实施新的规定。
