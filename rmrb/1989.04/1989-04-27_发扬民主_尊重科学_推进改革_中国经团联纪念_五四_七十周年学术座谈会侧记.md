On April 24, the China Economic Association held an academic symposium to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement. The speakers unanimously agreed that today, as we commemorate the May Fourth Movement, we must uphold the spirit of democracy and science of the May Fourth Movement, carry out the current rectification and reform comprehensively, and advance the modernization of our country.

1. Analyze China's national conditions with the worldview and methodology of Marxism, and explore our own path to modernization.

The speakers believed that one of the significant achievements of the May Fourth Movement was the introduction of Marxism to China, the establishment of the Communist Party of China, the proposal of the socialist goal, and the transition from the old democratic revolution to the new democratic revolution. Seventy years of history have proven that whether Marxism can be combined with China's specific practices is related to the success or failure of our cause. The current issue is not only whether Marxism should be combined with China's practices but also how to achieve a better combination of the two. From the experience of these years, we must not treat Marxism as a dogma and copy it mechanically; nor should we look for ready-made answers in Marxist books for China's problems. Instead, we must use the worldview, methodology, and basic principles of Marxism to analyze China's specific situations, find scientific answers, and create our own path to reform, opening up, and modernization.

2. Respect science and insist on a scientific spirit in dealing with everything.

The speakers believed that the scientific banner raised by the May Fourth Movement should continue to be upheld today. In the current era of peaceful development, intense economic and scientific competition is taking place. All countries, including developed ones, face serious crises and are actively taking measures to use high-tech achievements to transform their existing economies. Today's high technology in the world is based on science and is developing and changing rapidly, with high efficiency. It can be said to be the primary productive force. Only by focusing on this scientific technology can we improve our productivity and participate in the global market competition. Otherwise, the gap between us and developed countries will widen.

The speakers believed that respecting science is not only about focusing on high technology based on science but also about upholding the scientific spirit in all aspects. In the era of reform and opening up, we need to scientifically understand Chinese society, scientifically understand capitalism, scientifically understand socialism, scientifically understand the current situation, and scientifically handle the relationship between rectification, reform, and opening up. We need to see that the fundamental contradictions of the capitalist system have changed and eased, and the leapfrog development of productivity in some capitalist countries shows that the capitalist system still has vitality. We need to see that the socialist system and the capitalist system have many common points and also face common difficulties. We need to see that ten years of reform have achieved significant results, but we also face a series of dilemmas. We need to see that, at present, reform needs rectification to create a good environment, but rectification must also be directed towards reform. Getting out of the current predicament relies on reform; without reform, there is no way out. One characteristic of the scientific spirit is not to acknowledge the constraints of theory, to break through, to seek new theories, and to find new methods.

3. Promote democracy and strengthen democratic political construction.

The speakers believed that conducting socialist modernization requires upholding the scientific spirit of the May Fourth Movement. Modernization requires scientific decision-making. Our construction model should be scientific, our reform model should be scientific, and the policies and measures adopted in the current rectification should be scientific. We must act according to objective laws.

The speakers emphasized that the scientific nature of decision-making cannot be separated from democratization. Without democratization to guarantee it, mistakes are bound to occur. Democracy is a restraint mechanism. Only when the people supervise the government can we ensure that decisions are correct and prevent the abuse of power. Democracy is orderly, and it must be procedural and legal. Currently, to strengthen democratic political construction, we need to improve the system of people's congresses, expand the powers of the people's congresses, optimize the structure of deputies to the people's congresses, strengthen the supervision of the people's congresses, and at the same time, give full play to the role of the media and strengthen public opinion supervision.

The speakers believed that promoting democracy requires ensuring the status of the people as masters of the country and correctly handling the relationship between state organs and the people. Our reform, opening up, and modernization construction can only succeed with the enthusiastic efforts of the people. Rural reform should strengthen the subjectivity of farmers, urban reform should strengthen the subjectivity of workers and entrepreneurs, and political system reform should strengthen the subjectivity of all the people, especially intellectuals, making them independent commodity producers and operators, truly enjoying the democratic rights stipulated in the Constitution and laws, and forming a lively and vigorous political and economic situation.

4. We need not only Mr. Democracy (Mr. De) and Mr. Science (Mr. Sai), but also Mr. Commerce (Mr. Kang).

The speakers believed that from the May Fourth Movement to now, 70 years have passed. Why are the tasks of science and democracy proposed at that time still not well completed today? The reasons are, of course, many. But if we explore it at a deeper level, a very important reason is that the commodity economy is not developed. The nature of the commodity economy is equality and freedom. The commodity economy is the economic basis and fertile soil for democracy and science. The commodity economy is the heavy artillery that breaks through the long wall of feudalism. Without the great development of the commodity economy, science and democracy will find it difficult to develop to a high level. Therefore, we need not only Mr. De and Mr. Sai but also Mr. Kang (commodity economy). All those who care about science and democracy should be enthusiastic about the development of the commodity economy. To this end, we must carry out reform to the end.

　　发扬民主　尊重科学　推进改革    
    ——中国经团联纪念“五四”七十周年学术座谈会侧记
    ４月２４日，中国经济学团体联合会举行了纪念五四运动七十周年学术座谈会。发言者一致认为，今天纪念“五四”，要发扬“五四”的民主精神和科学精神，搞好当前的治理与整顿，全面深化改革，推进我国的现代化建设。
    一、以马克思主义的世界观和方法论分析中国的国情，探索我国自己的现代化道路。
    发言者认为，五四运动的重大成果之一，就是马克思主义传到中国，成立了中国共产党，提出了社会主义的目标，实现了由旧民主主义革命到新民主主义革命的转变。７０年的历史证明，马克思主义能否与中国的具体实践相结合，关系到我们事业的成败。现在的问题，不仅是马克思主义应否与中国的实践相结合，而且是怎样做到二者的更好结合。从这些年的经验来看，既不可把马克思主义当成教条，照搬照套；也不能拿中国的问题到马克思主义书本中去寻找现成的答案；而必须以马克思主义的世界观、方法论和基本原理，分析中国的具体情况，寻找科学的答案，开创自己改革、开放和现代化建设的道路。
    二、尊重科学，坚持用科学精神对待一切。
    发言者认为，“五四”树立的科学旗帜，今天还应继续高举。在当今和平发展时期，实际进行着极其激烈的经济、科学的竞争，所有的国家包括发达国家都存在着严重的危机感，都在积极采取措施用高技术成果来改造现有经济。当今世界上的高技术，是以科学为基础的新技术，发展非常快，变化非常快，效益非常高，可以说是第一生产力。只有注重这种科学技术，才能提高我们的生产力，才能在世界市场上参加竞争。否则，我们与发达国家的差距将会越来越大。
    发言者认为，尊重科学，不仅要注重建立在科学基础上的高技术，还要在一切方面坚持科学精神。在改革、开放的今天，要科学地认识中国社会，要科学地认识资本主义，要科学地认识社会主义，要科学地认识当前形势，要科学地处理好治理、整顿和改革的关系。要看到资本主义制度的基本矛盾有变化，有缓和，一些资本主义国家生产力的飞跃发展，表明资本主义制度还有活力。要看到，社会主义制度与资本主义制度，在许多方面存在着共同之点，也存在着共同的难题。要看到，十年改革取得了很大的成绩，但也面临着一系列两难困境。要看到，在当前，改革需要整治为之创造良好环境，但整治也必须以改革为方向。摆脱目前的困境要靠改革，不改革就没有出路。科学精神的一个特点是不承认理论的束缚，要求突破，寻找新理论，寻找新办法。
    三、发扬民主，加强民主政治建设。
    发言者认为，进行现代化社会主义建设，要发扬“五四”的科学精神。现代化建设要求决策科学化，我们的建设模式应当是科学的，我们的改革模式应当是科学的，当前治理整顿采取的政策措施应当是科学的，要按客观规律办事。
    发言者强调，决策的科学化离不开民主化，决策没有民主化作保证，必然要产生失误。民主是一种制约机制，人民起来监督政府，才能保证决策正确，才能杜绝滥用权力的现象。民主是有序的，民主要程序化、法制化。当前，加强民主政治建设，要健全人民代表大会制度，扩大“人大”的权力，优化人大代表的结构，强化“人大”的监督，同时发挥传播媒介的作用，加强舆论监督。
    发言者认为，发扬民主要确保人民群众的主人翁地位，正确处理国家机关和人民的关系。我们的改革、开放和现代化建设事业，只有依靠人民心情舒畅、生气蓬勃的努力，才能够获得成功。农村改革要强化农民的主体地位，城市改革要强化工人和企业家的主体地位，政治体制改革要强化全体人民特别是知识分子的主体地位，使他们成为独立的商品生产者和经营者，真正享有宪法和法律规定的民主权利，才能形成生动活泼、充满活力的政治经济局面。
    四、不但要有德先生（民主）、赛先生（科学），还要有康先生（商品经济）。
    发言者认为，从“五四”到现在已经７０年，为什么那时提出的科学和民主任务，到今天还没有很好完成，原因当然是很多的。但如果从更深的层次去探讨，那很重要的原因，就是商品经济不发达。商品经济的天性是平等自由，商品经济是民主与科学的经济基础和肥沃土壤，商品经济是打开封建主义长城的重炮，离开了商品经济的大发展，科学、民主就很难有高度的发展。所以我们不仅需要德先生、赛先生，而且需要康先生（商品经济）。所有关心科学和民主的人们都应该热心于商品经济的发展，为此，要把改革进行到底。（蒋映光）
