The Haidong region of Qinghai, which accounts for 2.5% of the province's area and 42% of its population, saw its birth rate drop from 26.2‰ in 1979 to below the national average of 18.2‰ last year. Calculated based on the birth rates of a decade ago, nearly 200,000 fewer births have occurred in the past 10 years, saving society 4.42 billion yuan. Of this amount, the state and collective sector saved 1.735 billion yuan, while families saved 2.687 billion yuan. These figures are based on calculations by the National Population and Family Planning Commission.

Haidong region comprises eight counties, four of which are autonomous counties for ethnic minorities. The region is home to Hui, Tibetan, Tu, and Salar ethnic minorities, who make up one-third of the total population. Over the past decade, the regional committee and administrative office have paid attention to guiding cadres and the masses of all ethnic groups to change old reproductive concepts such as "poor birth, poor upbringing," "more children, more blessings," and "preferring sons over daughters." They have implemented family planning policies suited to the characteristics of minority regions. Simultaneously, they have organized local religious figures to visit other places, requesting their assistance in promoting family planning, discarding some unrealistic traditional notions, eliminating outdated customs such as close-relative marriages, and gradually promoting late marriage, late childbearing, fewer children, and better child-rearing. This region, which has relatively relaxed population policies, now has a population of 1.82 million, an increase of only 120,000 over the past decade.

Another feature of the work in this area is the enthusiastic service provided to couples of childbearing age from various ethnic groups. Starting in 1984, eight counties and more than 30 densely populated townships and towns have successively established family planning propaganda and technical guidance stations. At the same time, technical personnel have been sent to the provincial capital and to Sichuan, Beijing, Nanjing, and other places for training, continuously improving surgical skills to give the masses a sense of security. They have also adopted a combination of layer-by-layer distribution of contraceptives and market sales, ensuring that 80% of the 300,000 women of childbearing age in the entire region use contraceptives.

    新生育观进入少数民族地区
　　海东十年少生廿万人
　　为社会节支达四十四亿多元
　  本报西宁4月11日电　记者郅振璞报道：面积占全省2.5％、人口占42％的青海海东地区，去年人口出生率由1979年的26.2‰下降到全国水平线以下的18.2‰。按10年前生育水平计算，近10年累计少生20万人，为社会节约44.22亿元。其中，国家集体少开支17.35亿元，家庭少开支26.87亿元。此结果，系按国家计生委人口成长消费调查推算。
    海东地区所辖8县中，有4个县是民族自治县。全区回、藏、土、撒拉等少数民族占总人口1／3。10年来，地委、行署五任主要领导都注意引导各族干部、群众努力改变“穷生穷养”、“多子多福”、“重男轻女”的旧生育观念，因地制宜落实少数民族地区计划生育政策。同时组织各地宗教界人士外出参观，请他们协助宣传计划生育，摈弃一些不切实际的传统认识，消除近亲结婚的陈规陋俗，逐步实行晚婚、晚育、少生、优生。这个人口政策较为宽松的地区，现有人口182万，仅比10年前增长12万人。
    热心为多民族育龄夫妇服务，是该区工作又一特点。从1984年开始，8县和30多个人口密集乡、镇陆续筹建计划生育宣传技术指导站，同时派技术人员到省会和四川、北京、南京等地培训，手术水平不断提高，使群众有安全感；还采取层层发放避孕药具和市场零售相结合的办法，使全区30万育龄妇女节育率达80％。
