Title: Reflections on the Passing of Time

Edition: 5

Just brewed a pot of fine Longjing tea, and I noticed that a set of "Wanxiang Series" books published by People's Daily Press had neatly appeared on my desk. Upon opening one, I knew that today I would once again be plunged into thoughts of worry and lamentation about China, despite the courage that also arises from it. Indeed, the editor clearly tells you that this series is primarily composed of reportage literature, reflecting the "struggle between tradition and progress."

In the field of reportage literature, Xiao Fuxing, who is already an old hand, cannot escape his deep affection and sense of responsibility for his contemporaries. In "Ah, Class of '66," he sings a song of pride amidst desolation. The number of people who graduated from junior high and high school in 1966, 1967, and 1968 is in the tens of thousands. Just seeing this title will make a surge of bitter, sweet, and sour emotions well up. Xiao Fuxing invited 10 people from the unknown "Class of '66" in Beijing and turned them into friends of the readers through his pen. Among them is a worker from a gas appliance factory who brought back four children from the Sanjiang Plain in Northeast China, a graduate of Beijing University who slapped himself in the face at night because he had no house for his wife, a doctor from Tian Tan Hospital who still tightly embraces Beidahuang even after going to America... Xiao Fuxing's greatest skill is to make you shed tears.

Unexpectedly, across the Taiwan Strait, reportage literature had emerged 10 years earlier than us, although they call it "reportage literature." The 11 pieces collected by Zhang Deming in "The World of the Leper Hospital—Selected Works of Taiwanese Reportage Literature" are mostly award-winning works from Taiwan in recent years, and it is the first time they are facing mainland readers. Taiwanese critics say, "When literature falls into the disease of content poverty, reportage literature fills this gap and achieves a balance." This makes one feel the astonishing similarity between the two sides. However, reading these texts gives a sense of anxiety rather than the heavy sense of worry that often comes from reading works by Su Xiaokang and Qian Gang. This difference, for us, is it fortunate or unfortunate?

"Chinese People in the 1980s Abroad" is a portrait of people who have not returned from afar. Among the 6 pieces of reportage literature, Sang Fengkang's "Videotaping Overseas Chinese in America" is the most captivating. In fact, it is a videotape of the scars on Chinese people and China as seen by overseas Chinese in America. Almost every person who leaves the country carries endless bitterness as they turn their heads to leave this land of sorrow. They are watching the surging reform tide of their homeland with hope from the other side of the ocean.

After reading 3 books, the Longjing tea has already gone cold, and the rest can only be left behind.

　　万象忧思过眼录
　　锡兵
    刚沏了一壶上好的龙井，就发现案头齐刷刷地摆上一套人民日报出版社出版的“万象丛书”，翻开一瞧，便知今儿又该着陷入关于中国的忧思与哀祭之中了，尽管从中也生发出一股勇气来。这不，编者明白告诉你，这丛书就是以报告文学为主，反映“守旧与进取的角逐。”
    在报告文学这片原野上已算是识途老马的肖复兴还是摆脱不掉他对同辈人那份血浓于水的亲情和责任感，《啊，老三届》在荒凉中唱出了自豪。1966、 1967、1968年这三年初、高中毕业的人数以万计，只要看到这个书名，便会“哗”一下涌出酸甜苦辣诸般情感。肖复兴从北京默默无闻的老三届中请出了10位，由他的笔变成了读者的朋友。其中有一下子从东北三江平原带回来4个孩子的煤气用具厂下料工，有因为没房子委屈了妻子而半夜扇自己嘴巴的函大毕业生，有到了美国还把北大荒紧紧搂在怀里的天坛医院医生……肖复兴最大的本事是让你流泪。
    想不到海峡彼岸早我们10年就冒出了报告文学热，只不过他们叫“报导文学”，张德明收在《麻风病院的世界——台湾报导文学精选》里的11篇大多是台湾这几年的获奖作品，还是头一回面对大陆读者。台湾评论家称“在文学发生了内容贫乏的病症时，报导文学的起来填补了这个空隙，做了一种平衡。”这使人又一次感到两岸惊人的相似。不过，读这些文字给人的是焦虑，而不是读苏晓康、钱纲们时常有的那种令血液凝固的沉重忧患。这种不同对我们来说，幸耶不幸？！
    《八十年代中国人在海外》是天涯不归客的众生相，6篇报告文学中以桑逢康的《赴美华人录相》最精采，实际上是赴美华人眼中的中国和中国人身上创疤的无情录相，几乎每个去国者都带着无尽的辛酸扭头离开这块伤心地，他们正在大洋彼岸带着期盼注视着故土的改革大潮的日渐汹涌。
    品了3本，龙井茶早已凉了，余下的只好割爱。
