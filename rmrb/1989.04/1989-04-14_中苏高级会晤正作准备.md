	Preparations for High-Level Sino-Soviet Meeting Underway
	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 13 — Foreign Ministry spokesman Jin Kuihua said today that preparations for the high-level Sino-Soviet meeting are underway.

	Jin Kuihua said at the afternoon press conference that during Gorbachev's visit to China, the leaders of the two countries will mainly discuss the normalization of relations between the two countries, "that is, to end the past and open up the future."

	He said in response to a reporter's question that regarding the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations, China has proposed to remove three obstacles. "In this regard, some things have been done and some progress has been made, but it cannot be said that the obstacles have been completely removed." The Cambodian issue will still be an important issue to be discussed in the high-level Sino-Soviet meeting.

	He said that after the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations, to completely remove the obstacles, "there is still a way to go."

	The spokesman said regarding the Afghan issue, "We are pleased to see that the Soviet Union has withdrawn from Afghanistan. But according to reports, the Soviet Union has recently resumed providing heavy weapons assistance to the Kabul regime. We hope the Soviet Union will seriously implement the Geneva Agreement and not do anything detrimental to achieving peace in Afghanistan."

　　中苏高级会晤正作准备
    新华社北京４月１３日电　外交部发言人金桂华今天说，有关中苏高级会晤的各项准备工作正在进行之中。
    金桂华在下午的新闻发布会上说，戈尔巴乔夫主席访华期间，中苏领导人将主要讨论两国关系正常化问题，“也就是说要结束过去，开辟未来”。
    他在回答记者提问时说，关于中苏关系正常化，中国提出要消除三个障碍。“在这方面已经做了一些事情，并且取得了一定的进展，但还不能说障碍已经完全消除了。”柬埔寨问题仍将是中苏高级会晤要讨论的重要问题。
    他说，在中苏关系实现正常化后，要做到完全消除障碍，“还有一段路要走。”
    这位发言人在谈到阿富汗问题时说，“我们高兴地看到苏联已从阿富汗撤军。但据报道，苏联最近恢复向喀布尔政权提供重型武器的援助。希望苏联认真履行日内瓦协议，不要做不利于在阿富汗实现和平的事情。”
