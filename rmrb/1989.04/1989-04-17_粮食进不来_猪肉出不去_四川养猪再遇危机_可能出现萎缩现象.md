According to a report from the Market News, due to the inability to transport grain purchased from outside the province and the difficulty in shipping pork out of the province, Sichuan's pig farming industry is once again facing a crisis.

Currently, Sichuan's pork inventory has reached 120,000 tons, which is even higher than the inventory during the peak of last July and August. The small peak season for live pig sales is approaching, and the inventory is expected to increase by another 100,000 tons. The Ministry of Commerce has planned for Sichuan to ship out only 38,000 tons of pork in the second quarter. As a result, Sichuan's pork inventory will reach 182,000 tons, while the total capacity of the province's cold storage facilities is only 140,000 tons, far from enough to accommodate the surplus. If the cold storage facilities are full, they will not be able to accept more pork, leading to difficulties in selling pigs. An official from the Sichuan Food Company stated that during the third and fourth quarters of last year, there were issues with the delivery of bonus grain for pig purchases, and there were shortages of funds, leading to the issuance of IOUs. If purchases are stopped this year, how will they explain this to the farmers?

In the fourth quarter of last year, market grain prices rose, and feed was scarce. The provincial government dispatched a delegation led by a vice governor to the Northeast to purchase corn. To this day, out of the 600 million kilograms of corn ordered at that time, only about 50 million kilograms have been delivered, causing the price of corn in Sichuan's market to remain high for a long time.

### 粮食进不来　猪肉出不去　四川养猪再遇危机　可能出现萎缩现象

　　粮食进不来　猪肉出不去
　　四川养猪再遇危机
　　可能出现萎缩现象
    本报讯　据市场报报道：由于从省外购买的粮食运不进来，省内的猪肉又调不出去，四川的养猪业再次面临危机。
    现在，四川猪肉库存已达１２万吨，比去年７、８月份胀库时的数量还大。生猪出栏的小旺季即将到来，届时库存将要增加１０万吨。二季度，商业部安排四川调出猪肉的计划只有３．８万吨。这样，四川库存的猪肉将达到１８．２万吨，而全省冻库的饱和容量只有１４万吨，远远容纳不了。冻库装不下就不敢再收购，届时将会出现卖猪难。省食品公司的同志说，去年三四季度收购生猪时不少地方奖售粮难以兑现，资金短缺打白条子，今年若停止收购，如何向农民交待？
    去年第四季度，市场粮价上涨，饲料紧缺，省政府派出由副省长领队的代表团，到东北地区购玉米。时至今日，当时订购的６亿公斤玉米，运到的还不足５０００万公斤，致使四川市场的玉米价格长期居高不下。
