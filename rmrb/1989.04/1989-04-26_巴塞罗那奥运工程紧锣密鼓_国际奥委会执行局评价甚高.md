	Barcelona will complete all venues for the 1992 Olympics two years ahead of schedule.

	The chief executive of the Barcelona Olympic Organizing Committee, Jose Miguel Abad, said today: "All the Olympic venues currently under construction will be completed by 1990." He said that the cost of all the venues being built is increasing, and inflation is expected to reach 10%. Abad pointed out: "To avoid excessive spending, all venues must be completed next year."

	The chairman of the Olympic Organizing Committee, Pascual Maragall, said that the IOC Executive Board has given a high evaluation of the progress report for the preparations for the 1992 Olympics.

	He quoted IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch as saying: "This is the best report I have heard so far."

	In 1986, at the 92nd IOC meeting held in Lausanne, it was decided that Barcelona, a city on the Mediterranean Sea, would host the 1992 Olympics.

	Maragall told reporters that the modern Olympic Stadium will be completed on July 25 this year.

	He said that the opening ceremony, closing ceremony, and track and field events of this Olympics will all be held in the Olympic Stadium.

	Maragall also said that taekwondo will be a demonstration event for this Olympics, lasting one day.

	Taekwondo, originating from Korea, was also a demonstration event at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, where South Korea won 9 out of 16 gold medals. Since then, South Korea, through its members in the IOC Executive Board, has forced the IOC Executive Board to include taekwondo as an official event for the 1992 Olympics. However, Samaranch and other executive members insist on their stance, not adding more new events to the Barcelona Olympics.

	IOC spokesperson Michele Bedard told reporters that the Executive Board has approved 25 events as competition events for the Barcelona Olympics. She said: "This Olympics will only add badminton and baseball as new events. Women's judo is also an official competition event, but it is not considered a new event because men's judo competitions already exist in the Olympics."

	Members attending the IOC Press Commission meeting here visited the Olympic Stadium and nearby venues, and were surprised to find that the main stadium of this Olympics is located on the top of a steep hill.

	When asked if the marathon race of this Olympics will end inside the main stadium, Abad gave an affirmative answer. But he said they would find an easier route for the athletes.

　　巴塞罗那奥运工程紧锣密鼓  国际奥委会执行局评价甚高
    新华社巴塞罗那４月２５日电（记者章挺权）巴塞罗那将提前两年建成１９９２年奥运会所有场馆。
    巴塞罗那奥运会组委会首席执行官何塞夫·米克尔·阿瓦德今天说：“目前正在建造中的所有奥运会场馆都将于１９９０年完工。”他说，现在正在修建的所有奥运会场馆的费用都在增长，预计通货膨涨将达１０％。阿瓦德指出：“为了避免开支猛增，所有的场馆必须在明年建成。”
    这届奥委会组委会主席帕斯克尔·马拉加利说，国际奥委会执行局对于１９９２年奥运会准备工作进展报告给予了高度的评价。
    他引用国际奥委会主席萨马兰奇的评论说：“这是迄今我所听到的最好的报告。”
    １９８６年在洛桑举行的国际奥委会第９２次会议上，选定了由濒临地中海的巴塞罗那市主办１９９２年奥运会。
    巴塞罗那市市长马拉加利告诉记者，现代化的奥林匹克体育场将于今年７月２５日竣工。
    他说，这届奥运会的开幕式、闭幕式和田径比赛都将在奥林匹克体育场举行。
    马拉加利还说，跆拳道将作为本届奥运会的一个表演项目，为期一天。
    源于朝鲜的跆拳道在去年汉城奥运会上也是一个表演项目，南朝鲜夺得了全部１６枚金牌中的９枚。自此，南朝鲜通过其在国际奥委会执行局的成员迫使国际奥委会执行局将跆拳道列为１９９２年奥运会的正式比赛项目，但是萨马兰奇和其他执行委员则坚持他们的主张，不在巴塞罗那奥运会上增设更多的新项目。
    国际奥委会发言人米切莱·贝迭尔对记者说，执行局批准了２５个项目作为巴塞罗那奥运会的比赛项目。她说：“这届奥运会只增加羽毛球和棒球两个新项目。女子柔道也是正式比赛项目，但不是做为一个新项目，因为在奥运会上已有男子柔道比赛。”
    在这里参加国际奥委会新闻委员会会议的委员们参观了奥林匹克体育场和临近的场馆，他们惊奇地发现这一奥运会的主体育场位于一个陡峭的小山顶上。
    当问及这届奥运会马拉松赛的终点是否设在主体育场内时，阿瓦德作了肯定的回答。但他又说，他们将为运动员们寻找一条更容易的路线。
