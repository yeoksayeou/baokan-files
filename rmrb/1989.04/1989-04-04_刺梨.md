The mountains of Guizhou are rich in wild fruits such as wild peaches, wild pears, wild persimmons, and wild grapes. However, the most common is likely the prickly pear. They can be found sprawling along mountain paths, on the edges of fields, and by riverbanks. Every year, as spring approaches, the red and white prickly pear flowers bloom in abundance. Bees and butterflies flutter among them, adding to the charm of the scenic landscape. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, many poets from Guizhou wrote about prickly pears. For example, Zheng Ziyin wrote, “The fields are fragrant with rice, and the paths are often lined with prickly pears.” In the poem “Mountain Journey” by Hu Fengxiang's wife, there is the line, “The fragrant wind blows across the river, and prickly pears bloom throughout the mountains.” Folk songs often mention prickly pears, with a well-known song titled “Good Red Flower” that goes, “Good red flower, good red flower, blooming on the prickly pear bush. Good red flower, blooming on the prickly pear tree, whichever blossom faces the sun, it turns red.” Reading this mountain song, one can imagine the beautiful scene of young men and women singing and expressing their love in the midst of the prickly pear blossoms.

In August, the prickly pears ripen. The fruits are small, about an inch in diameter, and shine golden yellow. If you feel thirsty, you can simply pick one, rub off the fine spines on the skin, split it in half, remove the seeds inside, and pop it into your mouth. You will first taste a slight sourness, followed by a sweet, refreshing flavor that quickly spreads.

There is an old saying in the region: “When cucumbers are in season, doctors thrive; when prickly pears are in season, doctors struggle.” In the summer heat, eating too many cucumbers can lead to diarrhea, naturally benefiting the doctors. However, prickly pears are rich in vitamin C, and eating them not only prevents illness but also benefits the body, making doctors less busy. It is said that every 100 grams of ripe prickly pears contain about 2,500 milligrams of vitamin C, which is 50 to 100 times higher than oranges and 5 to 10 times higher than kiwifruit, known as the “king of fruits.” Nowadays, Guizhou has developed prickly pears into a series of products, including prickly pear wine, prickly pear soda, and prickly pear cookies, which are very popular.

In the countryside, the primary use of prickly pears is for making wine, a practice with a long history. Prickly pear wine has a low alcohol content but is rich, sweet, and refreshing. In January, when farm work is less demanding, it is the best time for visiting relatives and friends. Most of the year's weddings also take place during this month. No matter where you go, whether you know the host or not, the hospitable owner will insist on keeping you for a meal. The host will serve the most sumptuous dishes of the year and pour you a large bowl of bright yellow prickly pear wine, saying, “Drink up, cousin!” Prickly pears were once known as “sending spring back.” Drinking prickly pear wine indeed makes one feel that spring has arrived.

　　刺梨
    王尧礼（布依族）
    贵州的山区多野果，如野桃、野梨、野柿子、野葡萄等等，但最常见的，恐怕是刺梨了。山道旁、田埂上、河岸边，到处都匍匐着。每年仲春一到，红红白白的刺梨花就烂漫开来，许多蜂蝶出入其间，给隽秀的山野增添了不少丰采。明清两代的黔籍诗人多有写刺梨的诗句，如郑子尹的“田评香稻久，路折刺梨频”；胡凤翔妻《山行》中的“隔岸香风吹不断，山中开遍刺梨花”等。民间歌谣里言及刺梨的就更多了，有一首较有名的《好花红》，曰：“好花红，好花好，好花开在刺梨蓬。好花开在刺梨树，哪朵向阳哪朵红。”读了这首山歌，眼前就会出现少男少女在刺梨花丛中对歌传情的美妙图景。
    阳历八月，刺梨的果实成熟了。刺梨果大不盈寸，金黄耀眼。你如果感到渴了，信手摘下一个来，擦掉表皮的细刺，掰成两半，挖去里面的籽儿，丢到嘴里一嚼，就会感到微酸之后，有一股清醇的甜味迅速地弥漫。
    当地有一句老话：“黄瓜上市，医生得势；刺梨上市，医生背时。”夏天炎热，多吃黄瓜，容易导致腹泻，自然“医生得势”。而刺梨含维生素Ｃ极高，多吃不但不病，反而对身体有好处，医生的门前便冷落了，所以说“医生背时”。据研究，每一百克成熟的鲜刺梨含维生素Ｃ高达二千五百毫克左右，比柑桔高出五十至一百倍，比号称“水果之王”的猕猴桃高出五至十倍。现在贵州已对刺梨进行开发，制成了刺梨酒、刺梨可乐、刺梨饼干等系列产品，很受欢迎。
    在乡间，刺梨的最大用途是酿酒，而且已有很久的历史。刺梨酒的度数不高，味道醇厚、甘甜而清爽。正月里农活不忙，是走亲访友的最佳时节，一年的婚嫁仪式也多半集中在这个月。无论你走到哪家，无论是否认识，好客的主人都会把你留下，不吃饭不让走。主人把一年中最丰盛的饭菜端上桌来，然后给你斟上一大碗黄橙橙的刺梨酒，说道：“喝呀，老表！”刺梨旧名“送春归”，喝了刺梨酒，的确会使人感到春天来了。
