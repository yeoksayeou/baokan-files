Iran and Turkey have decided to recall their respective ambassadors to their home countries for "consultations."

Iran's recall of its ambassador to Turkey on April 4 was a response to Turkey's recall of its ambassador to Iran on April 3. Recently, Iranian media, authorities, and religious leader Khomeini have criticized Turkey's decision allowing female university students to not wear the traditional Islamic veil. The Turkish government views Iran's accusations as interference in Turkey's internal affairs.

　　伊土发生龃龉  各自召回大使
    新华社北京４月５日电  综合本社驻德黑兰和安卡拉记者报道，伊朗和土耳其决定召回各自驻对方的大使，以便同本国政府进行“磋商”。
    伊朗４日召回其驻土耳其大使是对土耳其３日召回驻伊朗大使所作出的反应。伊朗报界和当局以及宗教领袖霍梅尼最近批评土耳其关于女大学生可以不戴传统的伊斯兰面纱的决定。土耳其政府认为伊朗的这种指责是对土耳其内部事务的干涉。
