The United Nations Security Council today continued its debate on the situation in Afghanistan. Most representatives, in their speeches, believed that achieving national reconciliation and establishing a government with a broad base are key to resolving the Afghan issue.

The observer from the Organization of the Islamic Conference to the United Nations, Engin Ansei, pointed out in his speech that establishing a broadly based interim government is a necessary guarantee for restoring peace in Afghanistan. It will help Afghan refugees voluntarily return to their homeland and also help the Afghan people exercise their right to self-determination.

The representative from Saudi Arabia, Samir Shihabi, believed that the Afghan issue is a matter between the Kabul regime and the Afghan people. Therefore, establishing a broadly based government that represents all the Afghan people to replace the current Kabul regime is the most fundamental condition for permanently resolving the Afghan issue.

　　联合国安理会继续辩论阿富汗问题
　　多数代表要求建立广泛基础的政府
    新华社联合国４月１７日电　联合国安理会今天继续就阿富汗形势问题进行辩论。大多数代表在发言中认为，实现民族和解、建立一个具有广泛基础的政府，是解决阿富汗问题的关键。
    伊斯兰会议组织常驻联合国观察员恩金·安塞伊在发言中指出，建立一个基础广泛的临时政府，是恢复阿富汗和平的必要保证，有助于阿富汗难民自愿返回家园，同时，也有助于阿富汗人民行使民族自决权。
    沙特阿拉伯代表萨米尔·什哈比认为，阿富汗问题是喀布尔政权与阿富汗人民之间的问题。因此，建立一基础广泛、并代表全体阿富汗人民的政府来取代喀布尔现政权是永久解决阿富汗问题的最基本条件。（附图片）
