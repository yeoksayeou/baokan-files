Allowing the Market Economy to Play a Greater Role

– The Trend of the Swedish Social Democratic Party's Economic Policy

People's Daily reporter Gu Yaoming

Over the next 10 years, whether Sweden will maintain its existing economic model or develop more towards a market economy is a question that the Swedish Social Democratic Party is discussing on the eve of its 100th anniversary.

During its more than 50 years in power, the Swedish Social Democratic Party has, under the premise of maintaining private ownership of the means of production, used legislation and taxation, monetary policy, price controls, and other means to control and intervene in the economy. This has prevented the concentration of power and wealth, achieving the dual goals of economic development and fair wealth distribution. This economic policy has not only led to relatively rapid economic development in Sweden but has also established a social welfare system that is renowned worldwide.

However, with the development of society and changes in the international environment, this economic model has encountered many problems, most of which stem from the main contradiction between state control and intervention and the role of the market:

The Social Democratic Party implements a high progressive tax system. Due to the high tax rates, it has affected the enthusiasm of individuals and enterprises.

Sweden's railways, postal services, medical care, education, and other public services are all state-run. The government has to use 30% of its tax revenue annually to subsidize these sectors.

The government has long provided price subsidies for housing and food. Annual subsidies for food amount to 3.15% of the gross national product. In addition, to protect the domestic food industry and textile industry, the government imposes taxes or quota restrictions on imported foreign products. These protective measures have weakened the competitiveness of this part of the economy, leading to price increases and overproduction.

Due to the lack of incentives for resource allocation and improving labor productivity, the role of the market mechanism has been continuously weakened. The growth rate of the gross national product has remained at a low level. Since the 1980s, Sweden's average growth rate has hovered around 2%. Its wage growth rate and domestic consumption growth rate have exceeded the economic growth rate. Coupled with other factors, this has led to an inflation rate higher than the average of the OECD.

Sweden is a small, open economy with a high dependence on foreign trade. More than half of its products are exported. The government's strict control over foreign exchange and other financial activities, along with high taxes, has not only affected Sweden's enterprises in international competition but also affected cooperation with foreign companies.

The above factors have prompted the Social Democratic Party to consider adjusting its economic policies. From the party's policy reports, it can be seen that in the coming period, it will implement a policy of tightening fiscal spending, stimulating supply, reducing consumption, and improving productivity. It will make relatively large reforms in the following four areas:

Improve the efficiency of public services and state-owned enterprises, implement decentralization, and give regions and municipalities more autonomy. The government will also hand over some public services to private management and allow private clinics and schools to operate, thereby improving the efficiency of public services.

Make the tax system more reasonable. The Social Democratic Party has proposed plans to significantly reduce personal income tax rates, encouraging people to work hard and save; significantly reduce corporate taxes, encouraging capital flow and production development in enterprises. At the same time, expand indirect tax sources, increase value-added tax, and plug loopholes to reduce tax exemptions, ensuring that government revenue is not affected.

Eliminate foreign exchange controls. By 1991, completely eliminate the existing foreign exchange control regulations. The government will take some appropriate tax measures as supplementary means to manage financial activities.

Reduce subsidies and encourage free competition. The government will gradually reduce subsidies for food, transportation, housing, and other sectors over the next three years and stop supporting long-term loss-making enterprises. Starting from 1991, it will cancel the quota restrictions on imported textiles and reduce the import tax on food to stimulate free competition in these sectors, aiming to lower market prices and improve the competitiveness of Swedish enterprises.

The above policies are controversial within and outside the Social Democratic Party. Some people are concerned that the results may deviate from the party's established goal of "social welfare solidarity and equal distribution." Those who support these policy changes believe that the government has not abandoned necessary economic control but has reduced unreasonable interventions, thereby making the economy more dynamic. The debate is still ongoing, but the trend of the Social Democratic Party's policies is already quite clear: moving towards a more market-oriented economy. Additionally, it is not content with its achievements, daring to openly expose and discuss problems in its policies, and continuously exploring new solutions. This can be said to be the main reason for the success of Sweden's economic model.

### 让市场经济发挥更大的作用——瑞典社民党经济政策的趋向

　　让市场经济发挥更大的作用
    ——瑞典社民党经济政策的趋向
    本报记者  顾耀铭
    今后１０年瑞典的经济政策是维持原有的经济模式，还是朝着更多的市场经济发展，这是瑞典社民党在庆祝成立１００周年前夕讨论的一个问题。
    瑞典社民党在长达５０多年的执政期间，在保持生产资料私有制的前提下，通过立法和税收、货币、价格等手段，对经济进行了控制和干预，防止权力和财富过分集中，以实现既发展经济，又尽可能公平地分配财富的双重目的。这个经济政策不仅使瑞典的经济得到较快的发展，而且建立了一套举世瞩目的社会福利制度。
    然而，随着社会的发展和国际环境的变化，这一经济模式遇到了不少问题，其中大多起源于国家的控制干预与市场作用的发挥这一主要矛盾上：
    社民党实行高额累进税制，由于税率过高，影响了个人和企业的积极性。
    瑞典的铁路、邮电、医疗保健、教育等公共事业都是国营，政府每年不得不将税务收入的３０％用于补助这部分事业。
    政府对住房和食品等一直实行价格补贴，每年对食品的补贴相当于国民生产总值的３．１５％，此外，为了保护本国的食品工业和纺织业，政府对进口外国产品实行征税或配额限制。这一保护措施使这部分经济竞争意识削弱，价格上升，生产过剩。
    由于对资源分配和提高劳动生产率缺乏刺激，导致市场机制作用不断减弱，国民生产总值增长率停留在低水平，自８０年代以来，瑞典平均增长率徘徊在２％左右，其工资增长率、国内消费增长率超过了经济增长速度，再加上其它因素，促使通货膨胀率高于经合组织平均水平。
    瑞典属小型开放经济，对外贸依赖很大，产品一半以上供出口，政府对外汇等金融活动控制过严，税收过高，不仅影响了瑞典企业参与国际竞争，也影响了同外国公司的合作。
    上述诸多因素都促使社民党不能不考虑对经济政策进行调整。从社民党的一些政策报告中可以看到，在今后一段时间内它将执行紧缩财政开支同刺激供应、减少消费、提高生产力相结合的政策。它将在以下４个方面进行比较大的改革：
    提高公共事业和国营企业的效率，实行权力下放，使地区、市有更大自主权。政府还将把一部分公共事业交私人负责经营，并允许私人开设诊所、学校，以促使公共事业提高效率。
    使税收制度更加合理。社民党已提出方案，将大幅度地降低个人所得税率，促使人们努力工作和储蓄；大量减少企业税，鼓励企业资本流动，发展生产。同时，扩大非直接税源，提高增值税，并堵塞漏洞，减少减免税，使政府收入免受影响。
    取消外汇控制。在１９９１年前完全取消目前尚存的外汇控制规定。政府将采取一些适当的征税措施作为补充手段，对金融活动进行管理。
    减少补贴，鼓励自由竞争。政府将在今后３年内逐步减少对食品、运输、住房等补贴，取消对长期亏损企业的资助。从１９９１年开始取消对进口纺织品的限额，并减征食品进口税，以刺激这些领域的自由竞争，达到降低市场价格，提高瑞典企业竞争力的目的。
    上述政策在社民党内外都是有争议的。一部分人担心其结果可能会偏离社民党确立的“社会福利共同一致和分配均等”的目标。赞成这些政策变化的人认为，政府并没有放弃对经济必要的控制，只是减少了不合理的干预，从而使经济充满活力。目前这场争论还在进行，但是社民党的政策趋向已是十分明显的，即朝着更多的市场经济发展。此外，它不安于已取得的成绩，敢于公开揭示和讨论政策中存在的问题，不断探索新的解决方法。这可以说是瑞典经济模式能取得成功的主要原因。
