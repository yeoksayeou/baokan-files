In May 1969, following Lin Biao's "Number One Order," over 2,000 people from the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and its affiliated units were relocated to Huanghu Farm in Huangchuan County, Henan Province, to establish a "May Seventh Cadres School." At that time, military representatives had taken control of all major powers in the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, including party affairs, administration, finance, and personnel.

Hu Yaobang came to Huanghu Farm for "labor reform" shortly afterward. In the later period of the cadres school, the military representative decided to send him to various teams for labor due to his unwillingness to sign the conclusion and his poor attitude. This was to be done for one month in each team to accept "criticism from the masses." However, many comrades resisted, and this plan was not implemented. During the election of one representative to the Tenth National People's Congress and one representative to the Fourth National People's Congress, despite numerous obstacles, comrades still elected him as a representative. Although this was vetoed by "higher authorities," the will of the party and the people could not be defied.

In April 1972, the military representative made a review conclusion on Hu Yaobang's issues during the Cultural Revolution, labeling him as an "anti-party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought" "three-anti element." Hu Yaobang was very angry after reading it and refuted it point by point. The military representative asked him, "Then do you still consider your self-criticism at the cadres school valid?" Hu Yaobang said, "The self-criticism at the cadres school was influenced by the Lin Biao line; secondly, many secretaries' self-criticisms were elevated, and as the first secretary, I should take responsibility." On October 28, Hu Yaobang stated in "Several Opinions on the Review Report": "For some issues, if it is difficult to reach a consensus, I suggest that the military representative's review report be sent directly to the Central Committee without requiring my signature." Hu Yaobang was an unyielding warrior. In the last five years of the Cultural Revolution, he never signed the review report!

　　人格的力量
    铁骨铮铮　何畏淫威
    １９６９年５月，按照林彪的“一号命令”，团中央机关和各直属单位２０００多人，一锅端地迁移到河南省潢川县黄湖农场，办起了“五七”干校。当时，进驻团中央的军代表已独揽团中央党、政、财务、人事等一切大权。胡耀邦同志不久也来到黄湖干校“劳动改造”。
    胡耀邦同志在干校的后期，军代表曾因他不肯在结论上签字，态度不好，曾决定让他到各连队去劳动，每连呆一个月，接受“群众的批判”，由于许多同志抵制未能实现。在党内选举１名十大代表，全校推举１名四届人大代表时，同志们不顾重重阻力，照样选举他当代表，虽然遭到“上头”的否决，但党心、人心却是不可悖逆的。
    １９７２年４月，军代表对耀邦同志在“文革”中的问题，做了审查结论，给他定性为反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的“三反分子”。耀邦同志看后很生气，逐条加以反驳。军代表问他：“那你在干校的检讨还算不算数？”耀邦同志说：“在干校的检查，一是受林彪路线的影响；二是好多书记的检查都上纲了，我第一书记应当承担责任。”到了１０月２８日，耀邦同志在《对审查报告的几点意见》中说：“对某些问题的看法，如果难以取得一致的意见，我建议军代表的审查报告直送中央，而不必经我签字。”耀邦同志是个铮铮铁骨的战士，在“文革”的最后５年中，终于没有在审查报告中签过字！
