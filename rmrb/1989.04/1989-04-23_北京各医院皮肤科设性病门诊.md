Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 23rd.

Starting from mid-April, the dermatology departments in municipal hospitals in Beijing have been renamed to dermatovenereology departments and have opened venereal disease clinics.

These hospitals have established specialized venereal disease examination rooms and consultation areas within their dermatology departments to alleviate the concerns of patients who may be hesitant to seek medical treatment due to the stigma associated with venereal diseases. The confidentiality of patients' medical conditions will be strictly maintained.
