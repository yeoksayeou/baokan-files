The All-China Sports Federation and the Chinese Olympic Committee held conferences in Beijing. Li Menghua and He Zhenliang were elected as the chairmen of the two organizations, respectively.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 15th. 67-year-old Li Menghua and 60-year-old He Zhenliang were elected as the chairman of the All-China Sports Federation and the chairman of the Chinese Olympic Committee, respectively.

On April 13th, the All-China Sports Federation held its fifth national congress in Beijing. In his report to the congress, Li Menghua, on behalf of the Standing Committee of the All-China Sports Federation, reviewed the main work done since the fourth congress in 1964. He described the decade of reform and opening up as one of the best periods in the history of Chinese sports, a decade in which the federation was restored and developed, playing an active role. At the same time, he pointed out that under the strategic guidance of coordinating the development of mass sports, with the main task of promoting national fitness, and competitive sports, with the Olympic Games as the highest level, China has achieved remarkable results. However, in the primary stage of socialism, it cannot avoid being constrained by economic and social development, and there is still a significant gap in breadth and depth compared to the world's sports powers.

In the future, the All-China Sports Federation will no longer hold national congresses and will instead adopt a committee system. The national committee will be composed of members recommended through consultations from various regions and organizations, exercising the highest authority of the federation.

At the plenary meeting of the Chinese Olympic Committee held on the 15th, He Zhenliang reported on actively participating in the activities of the International Olympic Committee, developing cooperation with the Asian Games Federation, successfully hosting the 11th Asian Games, and promoting sports exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.

The Chinese Olympic Committee was originally part of the All-China Sports Federation, but after 1979, the two organizations became independent in terms of structure, although many activities were still jointly organized. With the further development of China's Olympic movement, the Chinese Olympic Committee will undertake more affairs and work in the future.

　　全国体总与中国奥委会召开大会
　　李梦华何振梁分别当选两组织主席
    本报北京４月１５日讯　记者汪大昭报道：６７岁的李梦华和６０岁的何振梁分别当选为中华全国体育总会主席和中国奥林匹克委员会主席。
    ４月１３日，全国体总在京举行第五届代表大会。李梦华在代表体总常委会所作的工作报告中，回顾了自１９６４年第四届代表大会以来的主要工作。他将改革开放的１０年，评价为我国体育发展史上最好的时期之一，也是体总恢复发展、发挥积极作用的１０年。同时指出，我国体育在以全民健身为主要任务的群众体育和以奥运会为最高层次的竞技体育协调发展的战略指导下，取得了举世瞩目的成就，但在社会主义初级阶段，不能不受经济和社会发展的制约，其广度和深度与世界体育强国相比，还有很大差距。
    今后，全国体总将不再召开代表大会，并以委员会制度取而代之，由各地区和团体协商推荐的委员组成全国委员会，行使体总最高权力。
    在１５日举行的中国奥委会全体委员会会议上，何振梁就积极参与国际奥委会活动、发展与亚理事会合作关系、办好第１１届亚运会和促进海峡两岸体育交往等，作了报告。
    中国奥委会原来与全国体总是一个组织，１９７９年后在组织上相互独立，但许多活动仍共同举办。随着我国奥林匹克运动的进一步开展，今后中国奥委会将承担更多的事务和工作。
