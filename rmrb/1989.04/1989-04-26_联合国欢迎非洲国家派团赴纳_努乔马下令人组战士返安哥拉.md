The United Nations spokesman said on April 25 in Windhoek, the capital of Namibia, that the United Nations welcomes the observation teams from the Organization of African Unity and the frontline states to enter Namibia.

The spokesman said at a press conference that it seems there are still some minor procedural issues with the dispatch of observation teams by these two organizations to Namibia.

He said that the United Nations believes it is "very useful" for the governments of various countries to send their representatives to Windhoek to see for themselves what is happening.

According to news from Windhoek today, April 25, the chairman of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), Nujoma, ordered its fighters in Namibia to return to Angola by 6 a.m. on April 29.

A responsible person from SWAPO said this was decided at a meeting of the Joint Commission held in Ruacana, Namibia, last Thursday.

The South African side has decided to order its troops in Namibia to stay in their camps from 6 p.m. on April 26 to 6 a.m. on April 29 to create a safe atmosphere. The South African Minister of Defense said that his government's offer of 60 hours for SWAPO to withdraw its guerrillas from Namibia is the last opportunity.

According to reports, more than half of the over 1,600 SWAPO fighters who crossed the Angola-Namibia border into Namibia on April 1 have already returned to Angola.

　　联合国欢迎非洲国家派团赴纳  努乔马下令人组战士返安哥拉
    新华社哈拉雷４月２５日电  联合国发言人２５日在纳米比亚首都温得和克说，联合国欢迎非洲统一组织和非洲前线国家的观察团进驻纳米比亚。
    这位发言人在记者招待会上说，看来这两个组织派观察团来纳米比亚似乎还有点程序上的小问题。
    他说，联合国认为各国政府派自己的代表来温得和克亲眼看看所发生的一切是“很有用处的”。
    新华社哈拉雷４月２５日电　据今天来自温得和克的消息，西南非洲人民组织（简称“人组”）主席努乔马下令其在纳米比亚境内的战士于本月２９日早上６点以前返回安哥拉。
    “人组”的一位负责人说，这是上星期四在纳米比亚境内鲁阿卡纳举行的联合委员会会议上决定的。
    南非方面已决定从２６日下午６时至２９日上午６时令其驻纳米比亚军队呆在他们的营地里，以便创造一种安全气氛。南非国防部长说，他的政府提供６０个小时让“人组”从纳撤出其游击队是最后一次机会。
    据报道，４月１日越过安—纳边界进入纳米比亚的１６００多名“人组”战士已有一半以上返回安哥拉。
