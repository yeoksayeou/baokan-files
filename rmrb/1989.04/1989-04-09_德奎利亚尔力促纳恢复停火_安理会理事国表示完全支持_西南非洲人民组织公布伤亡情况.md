The United Nations Security Council unanimously expressed "full support for the efforts of the UN Secretary-General to restore the ceasefire and normalize the situation in Namibia."

This was announced by Alexander Belonogov, the chairman of the Security Council for this month, after a consultation meeting held this afternoon. The meeting continued to discuss the situation in Namibia and heard further reports from the Secretary-General on the matter.

The statement pointed out that the continued armed conflict in northern Namibia has caused serious concern to the Security Council and requires urgent measures to cease fire between the South African military and the SWAPO guerrillas.

The statement emphasized that the Security Council is determined to do everything possible to fully implement the UN plan for Namibian independence. Therefore, it is necessary to accelerate the deployment of military personnel from the UN Transition Assistance Group to Namibia and to call on countries participating in the assistance group to provide strong support.

It is reported that Secretary-General de Cuellar has proposed a seven-point plan to restore the ceasefire in Namibia, which has been conveyed by his representative to the South African Foreign Minister, Minister of Defense, and the leaders of the frontline states and SWAPO. These proposals will be discussed tomorrow at the "Three-Party Committee" meeting in Windhoek, the capital of Namibia. The committee is composed of representatives from Angola, Cuba, and South Africa and is responsible for supervising the implementation of the peace agreement between the three countries. Representatives from the United States and the Soviet Union will attend the meeting as observers.

UN spokesman Giuliani said that in the coming weeks, international peacekeeping forces from Finland, Britain, Poland, Kenya, and Malaysia will be sent to Namibia.

Xinhua News Agency, Luanda, April 7th: The defense secretary of the South West Africa People's Organization, Mwee-Hishangi, accused certain international media outlets of exaggerating the casualties of the South West Africa People's Organization on the 5th in Luanda.

Mwee-Hishangi announced that since the armed conflict between the South African occupying forces and the South West Africa People's Organization in northern Namibia on April 1st, the casualties of the organization are as follows: 38 dead, 51 injured, and 9 missing.

	4th April, a patrol car rumbles along the road in the Ovamboland region of northern Namibia, where normal life has been disrupted by the war again. So far, the conflict between the armed forces supported by South Africa and the SWAPO guerrillas has been going on for seven days.
