Xie Huida, an expert on rural development strategies. Formerly the director of the Science and Technology Department at Beijing Agricultural University and deputy director of the Science and Technology Commission's Key Project Bureau. Currently, he is the director and researcher of the Chinese Rural Technology Development Center under the State Science and Technology Commission.

Reporter: Reports indicate that in some places, farmers are slaughtering pigs that should not be sent to market, and a poultry farm in Su Bei buried over 2,000 healthy chicks. What is your view on this issue?

Xie Huida: The rise in feed prices has led farmers to believe that raising pigs and chickens is not profitable, but this is only the surface reason. The fundamental reason is that as the second phase of rural reform deepens, the risks in agricultural production are increasing. Small, scattered farmers find it difficult to compete in the large-scale commodity production market, and farmers have not yet come together to jointly address these risks.

Reporter: Currently, farmers generally face difficulties and frustrations such as a lack of accurate market information and technical assistance, unreliable sales channels for their products, and shortages of production materials and funds. Their small boats of commodity production are always at risk of running aground or even capsizing.

Xie Huida: The solution is to establish a socialized service system in rural areas. As early as 1986, central leadership pointed out that this is a major task for the second phase of rural reform. I believe that only by establishing a comprehensive rural service system can we truly achieve intensive and large-scale agricultural production.

Reporter: Some people think that to achieve scale management, we need to consolidate the farmers' responsibility fields into one.

Xie Huida: Not necessarily. Because the prerequisite for scale management is that it must be voluntary for farmers and depends on how many laborers can be transferred from the land.

On the other hand, it is not necessary to consolidate the land in farmers' hands to achieve large-scale agricultural production. Foreign farmers are mostly individual households, so how can they engage in commercial production? The key is that they have a system from pre-production to post-production socialized comprehensive service system (or support system) that links thousands of households together, taking the path of enterprise and group management to deal with the risks in the commodity production process.

Reporter: You mean like American farmer Henry, who, under the social support system, needs something, makes a phone call, and the relevant social service department delivers it. He farms only as one link in the entire commodity production process.

Xie Huida: Yes. Overseas, group and enterprise agriculture generally has two models. One is "company-linked farmers." For example, Thailand's Charoen Pokphand Group learns from this Western model. Taking poultry farming as an example, they rent chicken coops to farmers, provide chicks, feed, training, and disease prevention services, and finally purchase the products at a guaranteed price that ensures the farmers' profits (this is very important). In this way, farmers have a reliable backing for commodity production. The company integrates operations with services, allowing farmers to use modern technology to develop commodity production without risk.

Reporter: This way, the situation we mentioned at the beginning will not occur.

Xie Huida: The second model is "farmers cooperate to establish entities," that is, supply and marketing cooperatives. Still, taking poultry farming as an example, breeding is carried out by individual farmers, while procurement, slaughtering, and processing are done by processing cooperatives established by several joint households. Because the scale of a single processing cooperative is still relatively small, to meet the needs of market competition, several processing cooperatives join together to establish supply and marketing cooperatives, forming a unified brand, a large sales network, and controlling production and quality. In this group, a commercial and industrial adjustment structure is formed. The supply and marketing cooperative also includes feed and transportation cooperatives. Disease prevention and training technical work is undertaken by research institutions under the supply and marketing cooperative.

Reporter: Currently, what our country lacks most is such an organization that can provide comprehensive services for farmers' commodity production.

Xie Huida: Similar organizational forms have already begun to appear in our country. For example, some departments have established agricultural commodity production bases, providing seeds, funds, and technical training before production, providing pesticides and technical guidance during production, and purchasing according to contracts after production. In this case, farmers work with confidence, and their enthusiasm is also high.

There is another form, which is the voluntary establishment of professional research associations by farmers with the support of various levels of science associations. Some of them are exploring the establishment of service entities. This shows that our farmers are not generally afraid of "cooperation." True respect for farmers' economic rights and assistance in common prosperity, rather than "consolidating" cooperation, is welcomed by farmers. In recent years, technical contracting groups that have emerged in Hebei and other provinces have also, to a certain extent, provided comprehensive services for farmers. However, generally speaking, due to policy and system restrictions as well as other social conditions that are not in place, they have not formed a strong service system and industrial entity that can bear greater risks for farmers.

Reporter: I heard that you have new ideas on how to bring science and technology to rural areas.

Xie Huida: To make science and technology strongly support rural development, we must solve the organizational form of combining science and technology with the economy. I believe that the effective way to bring science and technology to rural areas is for science and technology to enter the rural comprehensive service system.

Reporter: What do you mean by science and technology entering the rural comprehensive service system?

Xie Huida: First, science and technology in rural comprehensive services should be multi-level. Only having low-level production, supply, sales, and technical services, without a strong technical backing, makes it difficult for a "one-stop" service to develop stably. For example, some places' mushroom seed factories, although they have undergone some seed cultivation training, can also cultivate mushrooms, but sometimes due to technical shortcomings, the mushroom seeds are contaminated, resulting in many mushroom farmers suffering disastrous losses.

Reporter: This requires higher-level technical services.

Xie Huida: Yes. For example, science and technology contracting groups embody the entry of science and technology into the economy. However, the technical level of contracting groups still needs to be continuously improved, which can be guided by hiring experts and professors. There are also farmers' research associations, which, in the process of realizing comprehensive services, invite professional technical personnel or even higher-level experts for business guidance, making the comprehensive service system more perfect.

In fact, we have already had good practices in this regard, such as the "Spark" program promoted by the State Science and Technology Commission in recent years. Practice has shown that introducing science and technology into the "one-stop" service system of technology, industry, and commerce can make "technical services," "input guarantees," and "production and sales guidance" all arrive at the same time, vividly embody the role of science and technology in transforming into benefits, implement paid scientific and technological services, and also solve the problem of how to make limited scientific and technological forces serve hundreds of millions of farmers.

　　科技应进入农村全程服务体系
    本报记者  王友恭
    奚惠达，农村发展战略问题专家。曾任北京农业大学科研处长，国家科委攻关局副局长。现为国家科委中国农村技术开发中心主任、研究员。
    记者：报载一些地方的农民又在宰杀不该出栏的架子猪，苏北的一个种鸡场一次埋掉２０００多只健康鸡苗。你对这类问题有何看法？
    奚惠达：饲料涨价，农民认为养猪、养鸡不合算，这只是表面的原因。根本的原因是随着农村第二步改革的不断深入，农业生产的风险在增加，分散而小规模的农户难以在大商品生产的风浪中拚搏，而农民又没有进一步联合起来走上共同对付风险的道路。
    记者：现在农民普遍遇到的困难和苦恼是缺乏准确的市场信息指导和技术帮助，产品销售没有可靠的渠道，生产资料和资金短缺。他们从事商品生产的小船随时都会搁浅，甚至覆舟。
    奚惠达：出路是在广大农村建立社会化的服务体系。早在１９８６年，中央领导就指出这是实现农村第二步改革的重大任务。我认为只有普遍建立起农村全程服务体系，才能真正实现农业生产的集约化和规模经营。
    记者：有人认为要搞规模经营，就要把农民的责任田再合一块堆儿。
    奚惠达：不一定要这样做。因为规模经营的前提是要农民自愿和取决于有多少劳动力能从土地上转移出去。
    另一方面，也不是只有把农民手里的土地合起来才能实现农业生产的规模经营。外国的农民大都是一家一户的，何以能够进行商品化生产？关键是那里有一套从产前到产后的社会化全程服务体系（或者叫支撑体系），把千家万户联结起来，走企业化、集团化的道路来对付商品生产过程中的风险。
    记者：你是说像美国农民韩丁那样，在社会支撑体系下，他需要什么，打个电话，有关社会服务部门就送来了。他种地只是整个商品生产过程中的一个环节。
    奚惠达：对。在国外，集团化、企业化的农业大体有两种模式。一种是“公司联农户”。如泰国的正大集团就是学习西方的这种模式。以养鸡为例，他们向农民出租鸡舍、提供鸡苗、饲料、培训和防疫服务，最后按保证让养鸡户获利的价格收购产品（这一点很重要）。这样，农民进行商品生产有一个可靠的后盾。公司寓经营于服务之中，使农民在没有风险的情况下采用现代技术发展商品生产。
    记者：这样就不会出现咱们开头说的那种情况了。
    奚惠达：第二种模式是“农户协力办实体”即供销合作联社。仍以养鸡为例，养殖由农户分散进行，收购、屠宰、加工则由若干联户办的加工合作社进行。因为单个加工合作社的规模仍然较小，为适应市场竞争的需要，若干个加工合作社再联合起来办供销联社，形成统一商标，有较大的销售网，掌握着产量和质量的调控。在这种集团里形成商贸调控工业、工业调控农业的格局。参加供销合作联社的还有饲料、运输等合作社。防疫、培训等技术工作由设在供销联社下的研究机构承担。
    记者：当前咱们国家最缺的就是这种能为农民的商品生产进行全程服务的组织。
    奚惠达：类似的组织形式在我国已经开始出现。比如某些部门办的农业商品生产基地，产前提供种苗、资金和技术培训，产中提供农药和技术指导，产后按合同收购。在这种情况下农民干起来心里踏实，积极性也就高。
    还有一种形式就是在各级科协扶持下由农民自愿成立的专业研究会。其中有一部分已在向创办服务实体探索。这说明我们的农民并不是一概害怕“合作”。真正尊重农民经济权益，有助于共同致富，而不是“归大堆儿”的合作，农民是欢迎的。还有最近一两年在河北等省涌现出来的技术承包集团，也在一定程度上为农民实行全程服务。但总的说来，由于政策和体制的限制以及其它社会条件的不配套，它们大都没有形成可以替农民承担更大风险的强有力的服务体系和产业实体。
    记者：听说你对如何把科学技术引向农村有新的想法。
    奚惠达：要使科技有力地支持农村的发展，必须解决科技与经济结合的组织形式。我认为把科技引向农村的有效途径是科学技术要进入农村的全程服务体系。
    记者：你所说的科技要进入农村全程服务体系包括哪些内容？
    奚惠达：首先，科技在农村的全程服务中应是多层次的。仅有低层次的产、供、销结合和技术服务，而没有强大的技术后盾，“一条龙”是难以稳定发展的。例如有些地方的菌种厂虽然经过一定的制种培训，也能培育出菌菇来，但有时由于技术不过硬而使菌种污染，结果使很多菇农蒙受灾害性损失。
    记者：这就需要更高层次的技术服务。
    奚惠达：对。比如科技承包集团体现了科技进入经济。但承包集团的技术水平还需要不断提高，这就可以聘请专家、教授加以指导。还有农民研究会，在实现全程服务的过程中请专业技术人员甚至较高层次的专家进行业务指导，可使全程服务体系更臻完善。
    其实，在这方面我们已经有了较好的做法，如国家科委近年来推行的“星火”计划。实践表明把科技引入技、工、贸“一条龙”的全程服务体系，可以使“技术服务”、“投入保证”和“产销引导”三者同时到位，可以生动地体现科技转化为效益的作用，可以落实科技有偿服务，也解决了如何使有限的科技力量为亿万农民服务的难题。
