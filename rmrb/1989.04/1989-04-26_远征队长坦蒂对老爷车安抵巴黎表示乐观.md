Expedition leader Tanti expressed optimism about the vintage car's safe arrival in Paris. Xinhua News Agency, Kashgar, April 25th: The Beijing-Paris vintage car expedition, covering over 5,500 kilometers, arrived in the ancient city of Kashgar at the foot of the Pamir Plateau yesterday. Expedition leader Tanti stated that although the journey ahead is still long, he believes that the Itala will reach Paris on schedule.

The president of the Italian International Hiking Tourism Company told reporters that the Itala vintage car, which departed from Tiananmen Square in Beijing on March 25th, has been running smoothly. After entering the ancient Silk Road in northwestern China, the expedition has faced numerous challenges, including snow-capped mountains, deserts, and strong winds. Despite several modern auxiliary vehicles breaking down, the Itala, although experiencing minor issues such as broken decorative lamp brackets and fan springs, has maintained its engine and tires in good condition. Therefore, even if the road conditions in countries like Pakistan and Iran are poor, the Itala can still pass through smoothly.

To prevent unexpected breakdowns, the expedition's mechanics have conducted multiple inspections and maintenance on the vintage car over the past 5,500 kilometers, replacing four glow plugs. The Itala's cross-continental expedition will pass through nine countries: Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, the Soviet Union, Poland, East Germany, West Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium, covering a total distance of over 22,000 kilometers. The expedition's journey in China spans 6,000 kilometers, the longest and most treacherous section of the route.

Mr. Tanti also mentioned that this vintage car, which traveled from Beijing to Paris in 1907 and was later displayed in the Turin Museum in Italy for 82 years, is now quite old.

Mr. Tanti believes that, barring any unforeseen circumstances, the Itala vintage car will successfully reach Paris before the French Revolution Memorial Day as planned.

　　远征队长坦蒂对老爷车安抵巴黎表示乐观
    新华社喀什４月２５日电  北京—巴黎老式汽车远征队行程５５００多公里，于昨天来到帕米尔高原下的喀什古城后，远征队队长坦蒂表示，尽管此次远征路程还很遥远，但他相信，伊塔拉将如期驶抵巴黎。
    这位意大利国际徒步旅游公司总裁对记者说，伊塔拉老式汽车于３月２５日晚从北京天安门广场出发以来，运行状况良好。在进入中国大西北的丝绸古道之后，远征队先后经受了雪山、沙漠、戈壁和大风的一次次严峻考验。在好几辆现代化的辅助车辆接连抛锚的情况下，伊塔拉虽然也出现过装饰灯支架和风扇弹簧被颠断等小故障，但这辆１９０３年生产的老式单座敞篷车发动机和轮胎等关键部件均安然无恙。所以，即使以后的巴基斯坦、伊朗等国路况欠佳，伊塔拉仍可以顺利通过。
    为了预防意外故障，在过去５５００公里的行程中，车队的机械师对老爷车进行过多次检修和保养，已更换了４个电热塞。伊塔拉的这次跨越欧亚大陆的远征，途经巴基斯坦、伊朗、土耳其、苏联、波兰、民主德国、联邦德国、荷兰、比利时９个国家，总行程为２２０００多公里。车队在中国行程达６０００公里，是车队所行路途最远、最艰险的路程。
    坦蒂先生还介绍说，这辆曾于１９０７年由北京驶抵巴黎、后又在意大利都灵博物馆里沉睡了８２年的老爷车，已很陈旧。
    坦蒂先生认为，如果不出意外，伊塔拉老式汽车一定能按原计划于法国大革命纪念日之前，顺利开进巴黎。
