Guangzhou Implements Energy Consumption Reward and Punishment System

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 4th — (Reporter Chen Bingguang) Guangzhou has implemented an energy consumption reward and punishment system, which has promoted the in-depth development of energy-saving work across the city. From 1984 to 1988, the industrial production value per ten thousand yuan in the city decreased from 3.05 tons of standard coal to 2.14 tons of standard coal, saving a total of 696,400 tons of standard coal over five years. This system links energy consumption quotas with rewards, sets energy consumption indicators for major products, and ties energy-saving bonuses to enterprise bonus distributions, including them in the enterprise's contract content.

　　广州市实行能耗奖惩制
    据新华社广州四月四日电  （记者陈炳光）广州市实行能耗奖惩制度，推动了全市节能工作的深入开展。一九八四年至一九八八年，全市工业生产万元产值能耗从三点零五吨标准煤下降到二点一四吨标准煤，五年共节约标准煤六十九点六四万吨。这项制度将能耗定额同奖励挂钩，对主要产品制定能耗指标，并把节能奖同企业奖金分配捆在一起，列入企业的承包内容。
