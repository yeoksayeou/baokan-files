On April 1st, a dining hall in the Jingxi Hotel posted a letter of thanks from the Shanghai and Tianjin delegations. Inside was a humorous poem:

	Frying, stir-frying, braising, deep-frying, boiling,
	Sweat drips on the stove's soil.
	Deeply knowing the meals on the plate,
	The canteen staff work hard.

It is understood that the praise in the poem is not exaggerated. Take the Shanghai delegation, for example. The Jingxi Hotel had never hosted them before. After the advance team from Shanghai arrived, the hotel initially learned about the Shanghai people's tastes and habits and drafted a menu. The Shanghai delegates prefer light flavors and dislike heavy oil and spicy food. The menu was adjusted several times to focus on light flavors. They learned that Shanghai people have the habit of drinking soup while eating, so they added an extra bowl of soup for each person in the Shanghai delegation. Breakfast was also supplemented with more sweets. For Tibetan delegates and Muslims, menus were prepared according to their respective dietary habits. For sick delegates and those with special needs, special cooking services were provided. In addition, the entire conference period was divided into three stages: morning, afternoon, and evening, with different menus for each stage. There were four dishes and one soup, catering to different tastes.

### “深知盘中餐　食堂皆辛苦”

　　“深知盘中餐　食堂皆辛苦”
    四月一日京西宾馆一餐厅贴出了上海、天津代表团的感谢信，里面有这样一首打油诗：
    煎炒烹炸煮，汗滴灶前土。
    深知盘中餐，食堂皆辛苦。
    据了解，赞扬诗并非过誉。就说上海代表团吧，京西宾馆过去未接待过。上海团先遣人员到达后，宾馆就初步了解了一下上海人的口味、习惯，拟订了菜谱。上海代表口味喜清淡，对大油、辣味不喜欢，几次调整菜谱，改以清淡为主。他们了解到上海人有边进食边喝汤的习惯，又多给上海团每人增加一碗汤；早餐则多配甜食。对西藏代表和回民，则根据本民族饮食习惯制订食谱。对病号和特殊需要的代表，专灶服务。此外，整个会期分早、中、后三个阶段，菜谱也有不同，四菜一汤，并适合不同人的口味。
