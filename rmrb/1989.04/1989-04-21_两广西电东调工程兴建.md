The construction of the 500,000-volt ultra-high voltage transmission and substation project, which spans across Guangxi and Guangdong, has commenced. The construction of the Pingguo and Laibin 500,000-volt substation hubs in the western section of the project has recently begun. This 500,000-volt transmission and substation project, stretching from the Tianshengqiao Hydropower Station in western Guangxi to Luodong in Nanhai County, Guangdong Province, traverses more than 20 counties (cities) and spans a total length of 975 kilometers. Along the route, there are three 500,000-volt substations in Pingguo, Laibin, and Luodong, as well as the Wuzhou switch station.
