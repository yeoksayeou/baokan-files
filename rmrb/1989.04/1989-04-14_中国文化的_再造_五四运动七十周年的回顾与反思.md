This year marks the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement. In the context of reform and opening up, people are reviewing the May Fourth Movement to explore the direction of current cultural construction. In the process of discussion, new insights are constantly emerging, and new problems are also arising. How to evaluate the May Fourth Movement's anti-traditional stance? Did it lead to a "cultural rupture" through "comprehensive anti-traditionalism"? What are the similarities and differences between the "cultural fever" and "new enlightenment" of the 1980s and the May Fourth Movement? How should we inherit and transcend the May Fourth Movement today? These questions are prominently placed before contemporary people.

	Rejecting Tradition for Enlightenment

	In fully affirming the historical achievements of the May Fourth New Culture Movement, we should also see that it did not solve the problem of how tradition can be transformed into modernity. Its goal was not the extinction of Chinese culture, but the "reconstruction" or "reconfiguration" of Chinese culture.

	Enlightenment movements take two forms: one is the form of "liberation through revival of the past"; the other is the form of rejecting tradition. Regardless of the form, one cannot engage in "arbitrary creation" without the soil of traditional culture; at the same time, one must and should achieve the goal of transforming tradition and creating a new spirit of the times.

	The Western bourgeois enlightenment movement initially took the form of "revival," that is, by reviving the humanistic spirit of ancient Greece and Rome, it broke through the cultural tyranny of medieval religious theology to promote individual liberation and intellectual enlightenment. Our modern reformers Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao advocated "liberation through revival of the past." Kang even considered himself the Chinese Martin Luther and recast Confucius into the "leader" of reform and innovation. Revolutionary leader Sun Yat-sen, who received Western education from a young age, still tried to trace the origins of his Three Principles of the People to Chinese culture when explaining them. After the failure of the Hundred Days' Reform and the abortive Xinhai Revolution, the traditional cultural system faced a comprehensive collapse. People groped for a way out in the dark night and could no longer find a compass or a point of return in traditional culture. Thus, the advanced intellectuals represented by _New Youth_ boldly proposed the slogan of "overthrowing the Confucian shop" through reverse thinking, using anti-tradition to promote intellectual enlightenment. The "Confucian shop" represented the cultural tyranny since Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty "abolished all other schools of thought and exalted Confucianism." Confucius had essentially become a spiritual idol for maintaining the feudal ritual order. The "Confucian shop" would not fall, and the tolerant spirit of "following the principle of freedom of thought, taking an inclusive and tolerant attitude" and the cultural prosperity of a hundred schools of thought contending and diverse opinions flourishing would not have appeared in the May Fourth period.

	"Overthrowing the Confucian shop" was not "comprehensive anti-traditionalism." Chen Duxiu once pointed out: "If we consider the newly introduced Western culture to be correct, then we must consider the existing Confucian teachings to be incorrect." But "considering Confucian teachings to be incorrect" does not mean "comprehensive anti-traditionalism," because Confucian culture is not the whole of Chinese traditional culture. "Confucianism is just one of the schools of thought," "the people of the Han and Song dynasties exalted Confucianism, and the schools of Mohism, Legalism, and the School of Names were all abandoned, leading to the decline of Chinese scholarship." "Even in terms of national essence, the old saying is that the nine schools are all beautiful. If one is exalted, not only will Chinese scholarship not shine, but even Confucianism will decline because of its exaltation. Everything in the world always thrives through competition and withers through monopoly, not just in the realm of scholarship."

	Another leading figure of the _New Youth_ faction, Li Dazhao, provided a deeper analysis of this issue. He affirmed that Confucius, in his time, "was indeed the center of his society and the sage of his time, and his teachings indeed represented the morality of his society and his time." However, the feudal rulers of successive dynasties always remolded Confucius, making him the spiritual pillar of the feudal ritual order. "Therefore, my criticism of Confucius is not a criticism of Confucius himself, but a criticism of the authority of the idol sculpted by Confucius for the monarchs of successive dynasties; it is not a criticism of Confucius, but a criticism of the soul of autocratic politics." Here, Li Dazhao distinguished between Confucius and Confucianism, indicating that what they firmly opposed was only the spiritual idol sculpted by the feudal rulers. It can be seen that the advocates of the New Culture Movement proposed "overthrowing the Confucian shop" mainly to criticize the ritual order and cultural tyranny of feudal society, and it is inappropriate to summarize it as "comprehensive anti-traditionalism."

	The _New Youth_ faction resolutely opposed feudal traditional culture, aiming to create a new culture in China with individual liberation as the core and democracy and science as the banner. Chen Duxiu, in his early years of studying in Japan, believed that the "revolution to overthrow the Qing" was too narrow, and thus he was not interested in joining the Tongmenghui. After the failure of the Xinhai Revolution, Chen Duxiu summed up the experience and lessons, believing that neglecting intellectual enlightenment and individual liberation was the reason for the revolution's failure. Chen Duxiu believed that the individual is the foundation of society, and "satisfying desires is the fundamental reason for individual existence." Therefore, it is not about sacrificing individual freedom to gain national freedom. On the contrary, he believed that "freedom, equality, and fraternity" are the essence of "modern civilization," and that fighting for individual freedom and "equal human rights" should be the original starting point of the revolution. Chen Duxiu wrote in "An Appeal to Youth": "Since the idea of human rights and equality arose, the name of slave is unbearable to human nature. The history of modern Europe is called the 'history of liberation'—breaking the power of the monarch to seek political liberation; denying the power of the church to seek religious liberation; the idea of equal distribution to seek economic liberation; the women's suffrage movement to seek women's liberation. 'Liberation' means to break free from the shackles of slavery to complete one's autonomous and free personality." Here, he called the modern history of Europe the "history of liberation," and the core issue of the liberation movement was individual liberation.

	Chinese feudal autocracy was not as severe as in Europe. On the contrary, the cultural landscape formed under two thousand years of feudal autocracy—the Confucian moral code of "rituals and propriety" and "using reason to kill"—was even more severe than the religious theological rule of Europe. After the Xinhai Revolution, Chen Duxiu and others increasingly realized that it was a major cause of stifling people's creativity and China's backwardness. Therefore, _New Youth_ on the one hand loudly proposed the slogan of "overthrowing the Confucian shop," and on the other hand, it also loudly advocated: "All human endeavors are centered on the self. If this is lost, what else is there to talk about?"

	Hu Shi was also one of the main editors of _New Youth_. He advocated Ibsenism, advocating "saving oneself," and sharply pointed out: "Now someone tells you: sacrifice your personal freedom to seek national freedom. I tell you: fight for your personal freedom, and that is for national freedom! Fight for your own dignity, and that is for the nation's dignity! A free and equal nation is not built by a group of slaves!" It is very clear that Hu Shi and Chen Duxiu both regarded individual liberation and personal freedom as the starting point of their ideal society.

	If individual liberation is the core of the _New Youth_ faction's values, then the banner of democracy and science is the externalization or external manifestation of these values.

	In January 1919, Chen Duxiu also responded to the criticisms and attacks of the "National Essence" faction in the first issue of the sixth volume of _New Youth_ with "A Defense of the Charges Against This Journal." The "National Essence" faction criticized _New Youth_ for "destroying Confucianism, destroying rituals and laws, destroying national essence, destroying chastity, destroying old ethics (loyalty, filial piety, chastity), destroying old arts (Chinese opera), destroying old religions (ghosts and gods), destroying old literature, and destroying old politics (rule by privileged individuals)." Chen Duxiu did not deny these charges and then turned the conversation around, saying: "But tracing back to the source, the people of this journal are originally innocent. They only committed these heinous crimes because they supported Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science. To support Mr. Democracy, one must oppose Confucianism, rituals and laws, chastity, old ethics, and old politics. To support Mr. Science, one must oppose old arts and old religions. To support both Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science, one must oppose national essence and old literature." All the charges, in the end, were to support "Mr. Democracy" and "Mr. Science." In the eyes of the "National Essence" faction, this was a den of evil. In the eyes of the _New Youth_ faction, however, these were the two vanguards of individual liberation and the enlightenment movement. Therefore, Chen Duxiu said solemnly: "We now believe that only these two gentlemen can cure the darkness in China's politics, morality, scholarship, and thought. If because of supporting these two gentlemen, all the oppression of the government and the attacks, ridicule, and curses of society, even beheading and bloodshed, we do not hesitate." This "Defense" was not only a powerful response to the "National Essence" faction but also a passionate call to further promote the enlightenment movement.

	The New Culture Movement's criticism of the feudal ritual order and traditional culture was initiated by Chen Duxiu, but Lu Xun achieved more brilliant results. As early as his youth, when studying in Japan, Lu Xun had the insight that "salvation begins with the establishment of the individual," and the establishment of the individual begins with enlightenment. By the May Fourth period, he further used literature as a means of enlightenment and reflected on tradition from the perspective of "establishing the individual." _Diary of a Madman_ borrowed the madman's voice to angrily accuse the crimes of feudal culture and the ritual order. _The True Story of Ah Q_ further brought this cultural reflection to a deeper level. Lu Xun was able to deeply expose the twisted nature of the Chinese people under long-term feudal patriarchal culture, especially after the collision with modern Western culture and the heavy blow, this servile character turned into a strange "spiritual victory method."

	Of course, while fully affirming the historical achievements of the New Culture Movement in breaking with the old and creating the new, we should also soberly see the historical limitations of this movement. That is, it did not solve the problem of how tradition can be transformed into modernity. The New Culture Movement needs to eliminate the negative factors in traditional culture, but its goal is not the extinction of Chinese culture, but the "reconstruction" or "reconfiguration" of Chinese culture. The problem lies in the fact that cultural reconstruction is a very complex process of rational choice and integration. Criticizing the weaknesses of traditional culture and absorbing the excellent qualities of foreign culture are both labor-intensive, but the more difficult task is to discover the internal mechanism for negating and transforming traditional culture into modernity. Cultural reconstruction is a dialectical negation of traditional culture. Traditional culture contains genes that turn towards new culture. The process of reconstruction is always to melt the positive results of traditional culture, that is, affirmation within negation, negation within affirmation, and it is impossible to sever the internal connection between modernization and traditional culture.

	The Call of a New Era

	The negative factors in Chinese traditional culture form a resistance to the process of reform and modernization, and its excellent traditions, if not deeply transformed, cannot become a powerful force to promote modernization. Therefore, inheriting and transcending the May Fourth Movement is a daunting task.

	Since the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, corresponding to the changes in reality, people's understanding of change has shifted from partial to holistic and from phenomenon to essence. Scholars in the academic community have tried to explore the intrinsic causes of the "Cultural Revolution" tragedy from a holistic and broader cultural background and to explore the path forward. It is under these circumstances that the "cultural fever" of the 1980s arose, and the call for a new enlightenment was issued.

	The "hotspot" of cultural discussions is the relationship between Chinese and Western cultures and modernization. The differences between Chinese and Western cultures have both national and temporal aspects. The essence of temporal differences lies in the fact that they are formed on the basis of different foundations of industrial commodity economy and agricultural natural economy. Now we often encounter the conflict between traditional culture and the requirements of socialist modernization construction. The ritual order and traditional culture formed on the basis of small peasantry and feudalism are prominently manifested as: the patriarchal idea of "heaven, earth, ruler, parents, and teacher" as a unified whole; the vertical subordinate relationship of superiors and inferiors; the philosophical system of "inner sage and outer king"; and even the art of imperial rule and relationship learning that delves into interpersonal relationships; and so on, all of which are negative factors accumulated in national cultural traditions. Coupled with the theory of class struggle and dictatorship introduced from the Soviet Union, the harm is even greater. In the unprecedented ten years, these poisons broke out, causing our nation deep disasters. In recent years, the "Cultural Revolution" has been "thoroughly repudiated," but the virus that induced the "Cultural Revolution" cannot be eradicated in a day or two. In this sense, the cultural field still has the requirement of a new enlightenment movement to break the disguised ritual order and new and old dogmas of the "Cultural Revolution," and to reconstruct a new national culture that adapts to the requirements of socialist modernization under the conditions of opening up and reform.

	Starting from the requirements of socialist modernization, the new enlightenment movement should still take science and democracy as its banner. Science is opposed to superstition, and democracy is opposed to autocracy. Both are inheritances of the May Fourth Movement and negations of the "Cultural Revolution." Of course, today's historical conditions are vastly different from those of the May Fourth Movement. Science and democracy can no longer be limited to general propaganda and calls to action but must be deepened in terms of understanding and combined with the requirements of socialist modernization to be transformed into reality.

	The socialist modernization construction of our country takes the development of a macro-controlled commodity economy as the center, and the development of science and culture is the direct driving force of the commodity economy. Generally speaking, in the early stage of the development of the commodity economy in capitalist society, it is the commodity economy that promotes the development of natural science. In contemporary times, however, it is the development of science and technology that guides the progress of the commodity economy. The May Fourth Movement took place in a time of frequent wars and successive revolutions in the world. Some people in the Western world cried out "the bankruptcy of science," and some people at home used metaphysics to resist science. But the _New Youth_ faction, which was leading the trend at the time, went against the current and made "Mr. Science" proud, with academic culture in full bloom.

	Science uses experimental methods to uncover the mysteries of nature and explores objective laws that are not subject to human will; technology belongs to the nature of applied science, and it only touches the material layer of culture and cannot encompass science and culture. The late Qing Dynasty's Self-Strengthening Movement made considerable achievements in introducing Western technology, but it failed because it insisted on "changing the tools but not the way." The "Mr. Science" invited by the May Fourth Movement, however, penetrated the material, institutional, and spiritual cultural layers, embodying a spirit of pursuing truth. But after being repeatedly washed by the traditional way of thinking that emphasizes practical rationality for 70 years, the highest significance of science has been diluted, while its practicality has been strengthened. Therefore, the proposition that science is a productive force has been confirmed, but basic theoretical research is relatively cold, research funds are lacking, researchers live in poverty, the academic field has no forbidden zones but hidden reefs, and such abnormal phenomena abound. Overcoming these paradoxical phenomena depends on a change in the way of thinking, that is, transforming traditional practical rationality into scientific rationality. From top to bottom, we must cultivate the habit of respecting scientific rationality, promote scientific decision-making, oppose subjective guesswork, and eliminate unnecessary power interference that is superior to academia. From the perspective of reflecting on traditional culture, it is to give a creative transformation to practical rationality.

	Reform is a profound revolution. We call the current reform the "second revolution" after the founding of the country because it is a comprehensive change involving all fields of the economic base and superstructure. The deepening of the reform will inevitably put political democratization on the agenda.

	Due to the lack of social cohesion among small producers under the conditions of natural economy, they always entrust their fate to others. The maintenance of feudal autocracy in China for two thousand years since the Qin and Han dynasties is precisely rooted in this. Of course, there is also the idea of "valuing the people" or "people as the foundation" in Chinese traditional culture. The saying goes, "to obtain the people is to obtain the world," and "water can carry a boat and can also capsize it," always putting "valuing the people" and "loving the people" as a means of maintaining royal power. The May Fourth Movement invited "Mr. Democracy" from the West. "Mr. Democracy" originated from the enlightenment idea of "natural rights," and its starting point is "human rights" rather than "royal power." It is an end in itself rather than a means. However, after "Mr. Democracy" moved to China, he was long influenced by royal power consciousness, and his connotation also changed. Not to mention the "people's rights" of the Kuomintang period and "military rule" and "tutelage." Even when we often say "promoting democracy," it is often to advocate that leaders should care about the interests of the people and listen to the voices of the people. It is not an institution but only a style; it is not a goal but only a means. During the "Cultural Revolution," the call for "great democracy," such as "great debate, great criticism, big-character posters, and great debate," was almost the same as the "imperial edict of criticism" in the imperial era.

	At present, we are committed to developing a socialist commodity economy. The characteristic of the commodity economy is free competition and equivalent exchange. It requires commodity producers to have independent personalities and equal opportunities. In politics, it is necessary to settle the poison of autocracy, eliminate feudal privileges and personal dependence, and establish reform on the basis of "rule of law," and establish the country on the basis of "rule of law." From the perspective of culture, it is necessary to eliminate the idea of "valuing the people" of royal power and establish the concept of democratic freedom, and lead our country onto the track of socialist democracy as soon as possible.

	The deepening of the requirements of science and democracy reflects the timeliness of culture. At the same time, we should also pay attention to the national characteristics of culture. Since the May Fourth Movement, we have, out of the urgent need to change reality, focused our discussion of culture on timeliness. Today, to build a new socialist culture with Chinese characteristics, we must integrate the requirements of timeliness into national characteristics. This requires us to handle the relationship between inheriting Chinese traditional culture and accepting foreign culture, striving to make the socialist new culture we construct both modern and with Chinese characteristics, and truly become a driving force and spiritual pillar for the construction of material civilization.

	Reviewing the tortuous road of China's modernization, we have a deeper understanding that the negative factors in Chinese traditional culture have formed a resistance to reform and modernization; and the excellent traditions of Chinese culture, if not deeply excavated and transformed, cannot be forged or promoted as a powerful spiritual force for modernization. Therefore, studying the national conditions of China, analyzing the cultural soil of China, and conducting critical inheritance and creative transformation is a very arduous task. The stormy May Fourth period did not have time to carry out such in-depth and detailed work. Now we have the conditions to calmly complete the unfinished business of our predecessors. The contemporary new enlightenment movement should both inherit the May Fourth Movement and transcend the May Fourth Movement. We should, starting from the requirements of constructing a new socialist culture in the new era, make a breakthrough in the critical inheritance of traditional culture.

　　中国文化的“再造”
　　——五四运动七十周年的回顾与反思
　　汪澍白
    今年是五四运动七十周年。在开放与改革的形势下，人们正在通过对五四运动的回顾来探讨当前文化建设的取向。在探讨中新见迭出，新问题也层出不穷。对“五四”的反传统如何评价？它是否造成“文化断裂”的“全盘反传统主义”？８０年代的“文化热”、“新启蒙”与五四运动有何异同？当前我们应该如何继承“五四”与超越“五四”？等等，这些问题十分突出地摆在当代人的面前。
　反传统以启蒙
    　　在充分肯定“五四”新文化运动的历史功绩时，还应该看到它没有解决
    　　传统如何向现代转化的问题。它的目标不是中国文化的消亡，而是中国
    　　文化的“再造”或“重构”。
    启蒙运动有两种形式：一种是“以复古为解放”的形式；另一种是反传统的形式。无论哪种形式，都不能离开传统文化的土壤进行“随心所欲的创造”；同时，又都必须和应该达到改造传统和开创新的时代精神的目的。
    西方资产阶级的启蒙运动最初采取了“复古”的形式，即通过复兴古希腊、古罗马的人文主义精神，冲破中世纪宗教神学的文化专制，以推动个性解放和思想启蒙。我国近代改革家康有为、梁启超提倡“以复古为解放”，康氏甚至以中国之马丁·路德自居，将孔子改铸成为变法维新的“教主”。民主革命领袖孙中山自幼在海外接受西式教育，但他讲解三民主义，仍力图归宗于懦家文化。戊戌维新失败和辛亥革命流产以后，传统文化体系面临全面崩解，人们在茫茫黑夜中探寻出路，再也难以从传统文化中找到前进的南针或复归的基点。于是，以《新青年》为代表的先进知识分子便以逆向思维方式毅然提出“打倒孔家店”的口号，通过反传统来推动思想启蒙。“孔家店”所代表的是自汉武帝“罢黜百家，独尊儒术”以来的文化专制主义，孔子实质上变成了维护封建礼治秩序的一尊精神偶像。“孔家店”不倒，五四时期那种“循思想自由原则，取兼容并包主义”的宽容精神和百家竞起、异说争鸣的文化繁荣局面就不可能出现。
    “打倒孔家店”并不是什么“全盘反传统主义”。陈独秀曾经指出：“吾人倘以新输入之欧化为是，则不得不以旧有之孔教为非。”但“以孔教为非”并不等于“全盘反传统主义”，因为儒家文化并非中国传统文化之全盘。“儒学不过是学术的一种”，“汉宋之人，独尊儒家，墨法名家诸家皆废，遂至败坏中国。”“即以国粹论，旧说九流并美，倘尚一尊，不独神州学术，不放光辉，即孔学亦以独尊之故，而日形衰落也。人间万事，恒以相争而兴，专占而萎败，不独学术一端如此。”
    对这一问题，《新青年》派的另一健将李大钊作了更深入的分析。他肯定孔子在其所生存的时代，“确足为其社会之中枢，确足为其时代之圣哲，其说亦确足以代表其社会其时代之道德。”但是，历代的封建统治者，总是重新塑造孔子，使之成为维护封建礼治秩序的精神支柱。“故余之掊击孔子，非掊击孔子之本身，乃掊击孔子为历代君主所雕塑之偶像的权威也；非掊击孔子，乃掊击专制政治之灵魂也。”在这里，李大钊把孔子与孔教加以区分，表明他们坚决反对的只是封建统治者所塑造的一尊精神偶像。由此可见，新文化运动倡导者提出的“打倒孔家店”，主要是针对封建社会的礼治秩序和文化专制主义而发，把它归结为“全盘反传统主义”是不恰当的。
    《新青年》派坚决反对封建传统文化，其目标是为了要在中国创建一种以个性解放为核心，以民主与科学为旗帜的新文化。陈独秀早年留学日本时，就认为“排满革命”过于狭隘，因而对参加同盟会不感兴趣。辛亥革命流产以后，陈独秀总结经验教训，认为忽视思想启蒙与个性解放是革命招致失败的原因。陈独秀认定个人是社会的基础，“满足欲望是个人生存的根本原因。”因此，并不是要牺牲个人自由来换取国家自由。相反的，他倒是认定“自由、平等、博爱”为“近世文明”之精华，要求以争个人自由，争“人权平等”作为革命的原出发点。陈独秀在《敬告青年》中写到：“自人权平等之说兴，奴隶之名，非血气所忍受，世称近世欧洲的历史为‘解放历史’——破坏君权，求政治之解放也；否认教权，求宗教之解放也；均产说兴，求经济之解放也；女子参政运动，求女权之解放也。”“解放云者，脱离夫奴隶之羁绊，以完其自主自由之人格之谓也。”在这里，他把欧洲近代史称为“解放历史”，而解放运动的核心问题，则是个性解放。
    中国的封建专制主义并不是没有欧洲那样厉害。相反，在两千年封建专制主义下所形成的文化格局——儒家的纲常名教“以理杀人”，倒是比欧洲的宗教神学统治更为厉害。辛亥革命以后，陈独秀等人越来越清楚地看出它是窒息人们的创造精神和造成中国落后的重要原因。因此，《新青年》一方面响亮地提出“打倒孔家店”的口号，另一方面又大声疾呼：“人间百行，皆以自我为中心，此而丧失，他何足言？”
    胡适也是《新青年》的主要编撰人之一。他宣扬易卜生主义，鼓吹“救出自己”，并尖锐地指出：“现在有人对你们说：牺牲你们个人的自由，去求国家的自由，我对你们说：争你们个人的自由，便是为国家的自由！争你们自己的人格，便是为国家争人格！自由平等的国家不是一群奴才建造得起来的！”十分明显，胡适和陈独秀都把个性解放和个人自由当作他们理想社会的出发点。
    如果说，个性解放是《新青年》派价值观的核心，那么民主与科学的旗帜就是这种价值观的外化或外在的表现。
    １９１９年１月，陈独秀还针对“国粹派”的非难与攻击，在《新青年》第６卷第１号发表《本志罪案之答辩书》。“国粹派”非难《新青年》，“无非是破坏孔教，破坏礼法，破坏国粹，破坏贞节，破坏旧伦理（忠、孝、节），破坏旧艺术（中国戏），破坏旧宗教（鬼神），破坏旧文学，破坏旧政治（特权人治），这几条罪案。”陈独秀对这几条罪案一一直认不讳，然后话锋一转，以进攻的姿态说：“但是追本溯源，本志同人本来无罪，只因为拥护那德莫克拉西（民主）和赛因斯（科学）两位先生，才犯了这几条滔天的大罪。要拥护那德先生，便不得不反对孔教、礼法、贞节、旧伦理、旧政治。要拥护那赛先生，便不得不反对旧艺术、旧宗教。要拥护德先生又要拥护赛先生，便不得不反对国粹和旧文学。”条条罪状，归根结底，都是为了要拥护那“德先生”和“赛先生”。在“国粹派”看来，这是罪恶渊薮。在《新青年》派看来，这却是个性解放和启蒙运动的两位开路先锋。所以陈独秀义正词严地说：“我们现在认定只有这两位先生，可以救治中国政治上道德上学术上思想上一切的黑暗。若因为拥护这两位先生，一切政府的压迫，社会的攻击笑骂，就是断头流血，都不推辞。”这个《答辩书》既是对“国粹派”的有力答复，又是进一步推动启蒙运动的热情号召。
    新文化运动对封建礼治秩序与传统文化的批判，陈独秀是发起者，而鲁迅则取得更辉煌的战果。早在青年时代留学日本时，鲁迅就发表了救亡“首在立人”，立人首在启蒙的创见。到五四时期，他更深入地以文学为启蒙手段，从“立人”的角度反思传统。《狂人日记》借狂人之口，愤怒地控诉了封建文化与礼治秩序的罪恶。《阿Ｑ正传》则把这种文化反思引进到更深的层次。鲁迅正是通过这样的典型，深刻地揭露了中国国民在长期封建宗法文化的统治下被扭曲而成的奴根性，特别是在封建宗法文化与西方近代文化碰撞并遭到沉重打击以后，这种奴婢性格，就变异而成一种奇特的“精神胜利法”。
    当然，我们在充分肯定新文化运动破旧与开新的历史功绩时，还应清醒地看到这一运动的历史局限性。这就是没有解决传统如何向现代转化的问题。新文化运动需要清除传统文化中的消极因素，但是，它的目标不是中国文化的消亡，而是中国文化的“再造”或“重构”。问题在于文化重构是一项极为复杂的理性抉择与整合过程。对于传统文化弱点的批判和对于外来文化优秀素质的吸取都是很费力气的，但更为艰难的还在于发现扬弃传统文化并使之向现代转化的内在契机。文化重构是对传统文化的一种辩证的否定。传统文化中潜藏着转向新文化的基因。重构的过程总是要融化传统文化中的积极成果，即所谓肯定中有否定，否定中有肯定，决不能割断现代化与传统文化的内在联系。
　新时代的呼唤
    　　中国传统文化中的消极因素形成对抗改革和现代化进程的阻力，而它的
    　　优秀传统如果不经过深入改造，也难以成为推进现代化的强大力量。所
    　　以，继承和超越“五四”是一项艰巨的任务。
    中国共产党的十一届三中全会以来，同现实的变革相对应，人们对变革的认识也由局部进入整体，由现象进入本质。学术界的有识之士，力图从整体上，从更广阔的文化背景上来挖掘造成“文革”悲剧的内在原因和探索开拓前进的道路。正是在这种情况下，兴起了８０年代的“文化热”，发出了新启蒙的呼唤。
    文化讨论的“热点”是中西文化与现代化的关系问题。中西文化的差异有民族性的一面，也有时代性的一面。时代性差异的实质，植根于两者是在工业化的商品经济与农业自然经济的不同基础上形成的。现在我们经常遇到的是传统文化同社会主义现代化建设的要求相冲突。在小农和封建基础上形成的礼治秩序与传统文化，突出地表现为：“天地君亲师”五位一体的宗法观念；上下尊卑垂直隶属的等级关系；“修齐治平”、“内圣外王”的哲学体系；以至究心于人际关系的帝王术与关系学；如此等等，都是积淀在民族文化传统中的消极因素。再加上苏联传入的阶级斗争与专政理论，两相结合，为害更烈。在史无前例的十年中，这些毒性发作，给我们民族造成了深重的灾难。近年来，“文革”已遭到“彻底否定”，但诱发“文革”的病毒却非一朝一夕所能根除。在这个意义上，文化领域仍有一个新启蒙运动的要求，以打破“文革”赖以滋生的那种变相的礼治秩序和新老教条，在开放与改革的条件下，重新建构与社会主义现代化要求相适应的新的民族文化。
    从社会主义现代化的要求出发，新启蒙运动仍应以科学与民主为旗帜。科学与迷信相对立，民主与专制相对立，两者都是对“五四”的继承和对“文革”的否定。当然，今天我们的历史条件迥然不同于“五四”，科学与民主不能再停留于一般的宣传与号召，而要结合社会主义现代化的要求，在认识上加以深化，并采取积极措施使之转化为现实。
    我国的社会主义现代化建设以发展宏观控制下的商品经济为中心，而科学文化的发展又是商品经济的直接推动力。一般说来，在资本主义社会商品经济发展的早期阶段，是商品经济推动自然科学的发展。而在当代，则是科学技术的发展引导着商品经济的前进。五四运动发生在世界战乱频仍与革命迭起的年代，西方世界有人发出“科学破产”的惊呼，国内也有人举玄学以对抗科学。但当时引领风骚的《新青年》派却顶着逆流前进，使“赛先生”扬眉吐气，学术文化异彩纷呈。
    科学以实验手段揭开大自然的奥秘，探索不以人的意志为转移的客观规律；技术属于应用科学性质，它只触及文化的器物层面，不能包举科学文化。晚清的洋务运动对引进西方技术作出过相当的成绩，因坚持“变器不变道”而归于失败。五四运动所请来的“赛先生”，却贯通器物、制度、精神文化三个层面，它体现着一种追求真理的科学精神。但经过７０年来注重实用理性的传统思维方式反复磨洗以后，科学的最高意义被冲淡，而它的实用性则被强化。因此，科学是生产力的命题得到确认，但基础理论研究相对较冷，科研经费短缺，研究人员生活清苦，学术园地明无禁区暗有礁石，诸如此类的反常现象层出不穷。克服这类悖谬现象，有赖于思维方式的变革，即将传统的实用理性转化为科学理性。从上到下都要养成尊重科学理性的风气，推行科学决策，反对主观臆断，杜绝凌驾于学术之上的不必要的权力干预。从反思传统文化的角度来说，也就是要对实用理性来一个创造性的转化。
    改革是一场深刻的革命。我们所以把当前的改革称为建国以后的“第二次革命”，就因为它是牵涉经济基础与上层建筑各个领域的一场整体变革。改革的纵深发展，必然要把政治民主化提上议事日程。
    由于在自然经济条件下的小生产者缺乏社会的凝聚力，他们总是把命运寄托在别人身上。我国从秦汉以后，封建专制主义维持两千年于不坠，正是植根于此。当然，中国的传统文化中也有“重民”或“民本”思想。所谓“得民斯得天下”，“水可以载舟，可以覆舟”，总是把“重民”、“爱民”作为维护王权的一种手段。五四运动从西方请来了“德先生”，“德先生”导源于“天赋人权”的启蒙思想，它的立脚点是“人权”而不是“王权”，它本身是目的而不是手段。然而，“德先生”移居中国以后，长期接受王权意识的浸染，其涵义也发生了变化。且不说国民党统治时期的“民权主义”与“军政”、“训政”。就是我们经常说的“发扬民主”，也常常是提倡领导者要关心群众利益，倾听群众的呼声，它不是一种制度，而只是一种作风；不是一种目的，而只是一种手段。“文革”时期倡言“大民主”，所谓“大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论”，竟同帝王时代的“奉旨申斥”差不多。
    当前我们正致力于发展社会主义商品经济。商品经济的特点是自由竞争、等价交换。它要求商品生产者具有独立的个性和均等的机会，反映在政治上，就要清算专制主义的流毒，消除封建特权与人身依附，把改革建立在“法制”的基础上，把国家建立在“法治”的基础上。从文化的角度来看，就需要扬弃王权主义的“重民”思想，确立民主自由观念，把我们国家早日引上社会主义民主的轨道。
    深化科学与民主的要求所反映的是文化的时代性。与此同时，还应该重视文化的民族性。“五四”以来，我们出于变革现实的紧迫感，对文化的讨论偏重于时代性。到今天要建设有中国特色的社会主义新文化，那就不能不把时代性的要求融汇到民族性中来。这就要求我们处理好继承中国传统文化与接受外来文化的关系，力求使我们所建构的社会主义新文化既是现代的，又是有中国特色的，能够真正成为推动物质文明建设的动力和精神支柱。
    我们回顾中国近现代化的坎坷道路，更深切地感受到，中国传统文化中的消极因素形成了对抗改革、对抗现代化进程的阻力；而中国文化的优秀传统不经过深入挖掘和改造，也难以融铸或推进现代化的强大精神力量。因此，研究中国国情，分析中国文化土壤，进行批判继承和创造性转化，这是一项非常艰巨的任务。狂飙骤起的五四时期来不及进行这样深入细致的工作，现在我们却有条件从容不迫地来完成前人未竟的事业。当代的新启蒙运动既要继承“五四”，也要超越“五四”。我们从建构社会主义新文化的时代要求出发，在传统文化的批判继承方面，尤其应当有所深入，有所超越。
