Guangzhou Faces "Employment Difficulties" Again

On March 23, the *China Business News* reported: Guangzhou, which once proudly declared that it had "eliminated unemployment," is now facing a reversal in its employment situation. The number of unemployed job seekers is expected to reach at least 100,000, and with the additional impact of migrant workers, the employment difficulties are even more severe.

In the past few years, with the rapid economic development and the expansion of employment opportunities in Guangzhou, the labor market once experienced a situation where supply could not meet demand. The reversal this year is mainly due to the following reasons:

	* This year, more than 80% of Guangzhou's enterprises will undergo their first round of labor force optimization. The current 1.6 million employees in these enterprises will result in approximately 50,000 surplus workers who cannot be absorbed within the enterprise and will be unemployed;
	* In recent years, the growth of the labor force in Guangzhou has reached a peak, with an estimated 80,000 new labor force members this year;
	* The adjustment of the economic structure has led to changes in the direction of labor force allocation, resulting in an increasing number of people transitioning from employment to unemployment, with 50,000 people last year and even more this year;
	* The number of contract workers has been increasing in recent years, and the number of workers whose contracts are terminated or canceled is also increasing yearly, reaching a new high this year;
	* The implementation of the enterprise bankruptcy law and the promotion of enterprise mergers will inevitably lead to some employees becoming unemployed.

In addition, this year, due to the reduction in construction scale, control of economic growth rate, tightening of monetary policy, and the principle that state-owned enterprises will not recruit additional personnel from society, the demand for labor in enterprises has significantly decreased.

### 广州再现“就业难”

　　广州再现“就业难”
    ３月２３日《中国商报》报道：前两年曾一度自豪地宣布“已经消灭了失业”的广州市，今年就业形势发生逆转，待业求职者至少将达１０多万人，再加上外来劳动力的冲击，就业难的情况就更为严重。
    前几年，随着广州市经济的迅猛发展及就业门路的拓宽，广州市劳动力市场一度出现供不应求的局面。今年出现的这种逆转主要有下列原因：
    ——今年广州市八成以上的企业要进行首次优化劳动组合，这些企业现有的１６０万职工，经组合后约有５万名富余人员因企业内部难以消化而待业；
    ——近年广州劳动力成长处于高峰期，估计今年新成长的劳动力将有８万多人；
    ——经济结构的调整，引起劳动力投向的变化，就业转待业人数逐年增加，去年已达５万人，今年将不止此数；
    ——合同制工人数量前几年不断增加，终止、解除合同的工人也逐年增加，今年将达到新的高峰；
    ——实行企业破产法，推行企业兼并，也势必造成部分职工待业。
    此外，今年由于压缩基建规模，控制经济增长速度，紧缩银根，以及全民企业今年原则上不再从社会招聘补充人力等原因，亦使得企业对劳动力的需求大为减少。
