The 1989 China Cup (Samsung) International Gymnastics Competition Opens

	16 Countries and Regions Compete

    BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) — The curtain has just fallen on the fourth Asian Youth Gymnastics Championships, and another high-level gymnastics competition—the 1989 China Cup (Samsung) International Gymnastics Competition—has begun. From April 28 to 30, athletes from 16 countries and regions will compete in Beijing's Capital Gymnasium.

    Officials from the organizing committee said that 31 male athletes and 22 female athletes from Australia, Bulgaria, China, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, West Germany, East Germany, the Soviet Union, the United States, Hungary, South Korea, Hong Kong, Iraq, Italy, Japan, and Switzerland will compete in the men's and women's all-around and four individual events, vying for 12 gold medals.

    This year is an adjustment year following the Olympics, so most of the participants are young athletes. Some of them may become strong contenders for the 1992 Olympic Games.

    China will send two teams to compete. The first team consists of Li Jie, Li Jing, Chen Cuiting, and Yang Bo. The second team consists of Zhang Wei, Qiao Liang, Fan Di, and Zhang Wenning. They are currently among the best athletes in China.

    The competition, jointly organized by the Chinese Gymnastics Association and the China Global Public Relations Company, is the seventh international gymnastics invitational held in China since 1978. Coca-Cola Company has also provided strong support for this event. According to the organizers, the China Cup (Samsung) Gymnastics Competition has been included as one of the eight traditional international invitational competitions that will serve as qualifying events for the World Cup Gymnastics Competition starting next year. Therefore, the International Gymnastics Federation will conduct a comprehensive inspection of the competition's venue, equipment, organization, reception, competition, and reporting. This is also one of the reasons why this competition has attracted so much attention.

    It is reported that athletes from various countries and regions have already arrived in Beijing and begun their pre-competition training.

    The competition schedule is as follows: the men's all-around competition will be held on the evening of April 28, the women's all-around competition on the evening of April 29, and the men's and women's individual finals on the afternoon of April 30.

　　中国杯国际体操赛揭幕     
    １６个国家和地区选手参加角逐
    本报北京４月２７日讯  记者吴骅报道：第四届亚洲青年体操锦标赛的帷幕刚刚落下，又一个高水平的体操比赛——１９８９年中国杯（三星）国际体操赛又拉开了战幕，１６个国家和地区的选手２８日至３０日将在北京首都体育馆争相献技。
    组委会有关人士说，来自澳大利亚、保加利亚、中国、古巴、捷克斯洛伐克、联邦德国、民主德国、苏联、美国、匈牙利、南朝鲜、香港、伊拉克、意大利、日本、瑞士的３１名男选手和２２名女选手将参加男女个人全能和单项共４个项目的角逐，争夺１２枚金牌。
    今年是奥运会后的调整年，因此参加比赛的大多是年轻选手，他们当中有人很可能将成为１９９２年奥运会体操比赛中夺魁热门人物。
    中国将派两支队伍参赛，一队是李舸、李敬；陈翠婷、杨波。二队是张伟、乔良；樊迪、张文宁。他们都是目前我国最优秀的选手。
    由中国体操协会和中国环球公共关系公司联合主办的这次体操比赛，是自１９７８年以来我国举办的第七次国际体操邀请赛。可口可乐公司对这次比赛也给予大力支持。据主办者介绍，这次中国杯（三星）体操赛已被列入从明年开始的世界杯体操赛前８个传统国际邀请赛之一，这８个传统比赛将做为世界杯体操赛的正式预选赛。因此，国际体操联合会将对这次比赛的场地器材、组织接待、竞赛、报道等方面情况做全面检查。这也是这次比赛引人关注的原因之一。
    据悉，各国家和地区的选手已陆续抵达北京，并开始了赛前训练。
    比赛日程为：２８日晚进行个人全能比赛，２９日晚进行女子个人全能比赛，３０日下午进行男、女单项的决赛。
