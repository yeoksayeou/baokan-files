Recently, every market day in Xingren County sees a large amount of timber being sold, with each market day seeing around 50 cubic meters, the majority of which are young and mature trees.

On March 5, I visited the timber market in the urban area of Xingren County. I saw a large number of young and mature Chinese firs on sale. I roughly counted, and there were about 1,100 trees. The largest had a diameter of only about 15 centimeters, and the smallest was around 6 centimeters. This is truly heartbreaking.

Most of these timber logs were felled from forest farms. In recent years, due to the chaotic timber market and the lack of effective management, the amount of young and mature trees on the market has been increasing with each passing day, and the phenomenon of indiscriminate felling of trees has become increasingly serious. I appeal to the relevant departments to strengthen the management of the timber market and protect the country's forest resources.

　　兴仁的大批中幼树被砍伐
    最近，每逢赶场天，兴仁县城有大量木材上市，每场达５０多立方米，其中大部分是中幼树木。
    ３月５日，我来到兴仁县城关木材市场，看到上市的中幼杉木很多，粗略地数了一下，约有１１００多棵。最大的直径不过１５厘米，最小的只有６厘米左右，实在令人痛心。
    这些木材大多数是从林场砍伐来的。近年来，由于木材市场混乱，管理工作失控，中幼树木上市量一场比一场多，乱砍滥伐树木的现象日趋严重。呼吁有关部门加强木材市场管理，保护国家森林资源。
