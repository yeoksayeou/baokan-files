Currently, the phenomenon of students dropping out of school is quite serious. Although the causes are multifaceted, when it comes to students dropping out midway, I believe the fundamental reason is that some of our cadres and the masses lack an understanding of compulsory education.

Many places are not good at using legal weapons to enforce education with the law and handle matters according to the law. In the minds of some comrades, the "Compulsory Education Law" is a "soft law," which can be ignored, enforced loosely, or violations can be overlooked. They have a weak sense of legal awareness and do not fully understand the compulsory nature of compulsory education. In terms of stopping school-age children and adolescents from dropping out and employing school-age children and adolescents, there is a reluctance to act, and the work often remains at the level of general mobilization and appeals, resulting in situations that violate the "Compulsory Education Law" not being promptly investigated and handled. Both domestic and international practices have shown that compulsory education has a compulsory nature. Universal education can only be ultimately achieved on a legal basis.

Some parents do not recognize the importance of their children receiving an education from a legal perspective. In the minds of some parents, the education law is not a law. They often misunderstand compulsory education as free education and see studying as a family matter, willing to study if they want to, not willing to study if they don't. They do not realize that not allowing their children to receive compulsory education is an illegal act.

Some factories, mines, and enterprises, especially some township enterprises, illegally employ school-age children and adolescents. This is a serious violation of the "Compulsory Education Law," and it is as illegal as tax evasion. However, some enterprises do not take this seriously, and some law enforcement personnel turn a blind eye, resulting in the spread of student dropout phenomena everywhere.

Some schools do not operate according to educational principles, focusing only on a few top students, discriminating against and excluding students with academic deficiencies, treating them as burdens, and even expelling them from school. This is obviously also a violation of the Compulsory Education Law.

To solve the problem of student dropouts, we need to start by strengthening the compulsory education awareness of the entire society. Local governments at all levels should take full responsibility for the implementation of compulsory education in their regions and treat the popularization of compulsory education as a major task. In particular, they should provide and guarantee the necessary conditions for compulsory education. Currently, we should continue to seriously and solidly publicize the "Compulsory Education Law." We should mobilize all parties and take administrative, economic, and legal measures, like we do for family planning, to stop student dropouts. All fronts and industries should regard the implementation and support of compulsory education as their duty and not do anything that goes against the "Compulsory Education Law"; parents and schools should also ensure that minors receive compulsory education in accordance with the law.

### 不接受义务教育是违法行为

　　不接受义务教育是违法行为
    全国人大教科文卫委员会教育研究室主任  吴福生
    目前中小学生流失现象比较严重，尽管原因是多方面的，但就中途辍学来说，我认为最根本的原因，是我们一些干部和群众缺乏义务教育观念。
    不少地方还不善于运用法律武器，以法治教，依法办事。在一些同志的头脑中，《义务教育法》是“软法”，可以有法不依、执法不严、违法不究。他们法律意识淡薄，对义务教育所具有的强制性质认识不足，在依法制止适龄儿童少年流失和招用适龄儿童少年就业等问题上存在畏难情绪，工作往往停留在一般的动员、号召上，致使违背《义务教育法》的情况得不到及时的追究和处理。国内外的实践都表明，义务教育具有强制性质。普及教育只有建立在法律的基础上才能最终得到实现。
    有些家长没有把子女接受教育提到法律高度来认识。在一些家长的心目中，教育法不是法。他们往往把义务教育片面理解为免费教育，把念书看成是自家的事，愿念就念，不愿念就不念，认识不到不让子女接受义务教育那就是违法行为。
    少数厂矿企业，特别是一些乡镇企业，擅自招用学龄少年、儿童就业。这是严重违反《义务教育法》的行为，它同偷税漏税同样具有违法性质。而一些企业却不以为然，一些执法人员对此也不闻不问，致使学生流失现象到处蔓延。
    一些学校不按教育规律办事，只顾少数尖子学生，歧视、排斥品学有缺陷的学生，把他们当作包袱，甚至将他们撵出学校。这显然也是违背义务教育法的。
    要解决学生流失问题，需要从强化全社会义务教育观念入手。各级人民政府应对本地区实施义务教育的工作全面负责，把普及义务教育真正作为一件大事来抓，特别是要提供和保证义务教育的必备条件。当前，要继续认真、扎实地宣传《义务教育法》，要像抓计划生育工作那样，动员各方面力量，采取行政的、经济的和法律的措施，制止学生流失。各条战线、各行各业也要把实施义务教育、支援义务教育看作自己义不容辞的责任，决不干有悖于《义务教育法》的事情；家长和学校，更要依法保障少年儿童接受义务教育。
