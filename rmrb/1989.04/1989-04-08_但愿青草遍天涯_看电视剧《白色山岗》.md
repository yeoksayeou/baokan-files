The drama depicts a tragic love story, a human tragedy unique to the Chinese mainland, not just a matter of love. The culprit behind this tragedy is a long-deceased party secretary, a ghost.

In contemporary film and television, such impoverished and desolate small villages are almost forgotten. There is no bustling prosperity of individual entrepreneurs, no disco or pop music... This is the white mountain ridge, where people seem to live in a distant era. Even the mountain songs sound like primal cries torn from the depths of the lungs under immense pressure. To those eager to leap into the "era of entertainment," this television drama might not seem timely or interesting. But for an audience that, in addition to entertainment, also needs the conditions to sustain it, will they remain indifferent when faced with these seemingly unfamiliar but actually quite close mountain compatriots and their plight? Television has seen many prominent party secretaries, but who has ever seen a deceased secretary still controlling the lives of the living? This seems like a fanciful myth, yet it is a harsh reality.

"The crow died without closing its eyes," the villagers say of this secretary, known as the Crow, who couldn't bear to part with his young and beautiful wife. But this man, who even in death wouldn't let go of what he had in life, had made arrangements for his afterlife. He couldn't build an underground palace like ancient emperors or bury living people and horses with him. Nor could he, like the revered figures of advanced industrial nations in the East, bring his favorite things, including the names of movie stars, into the grave. But he had his own unique way of arranging his affairs, a blend of inheritance and innovation from ancient rulers. Before his death, he personally appointed a new leadership team. As for how to control his wife, he made more meticulous and innovative secret arrangements: he had the shepherd, Tian San Yue, secretly monitor her and report the results to his grave. If his wife showed any improper behavior, San Yue was to administer "family law" to her. Thus, even in death, his ghost was ever-present, and the entire village and his family remained under the control of a non-existent Tian Mu Gen. The imposing tomb on the mountain ridge (which inevitably reminds one of the grand mausoleum at the foot of Mount Li) seemed to oversee and guard the village day and night, becoming a symbol of unyielding rule. The people of the white mountain ridge lived under the shadow of this ghost, "coming and going naked, burying you today, burying us tomorrow" ... just like the white mountain ridge, lacking vitality, and evoking a sense of eternal desolation and sadness.

However, Tian Mu Gen's wife, Li Qing Cao, did not want to be manipulated by the ghost. She even disliked being called "Mu Gen's wife" instead of her own name. She was outwardly calm but inwardly strong, embodying the straightforward spirit of the people of the Shandong mountains. Like grass, she was full of life. Unfortunately, she fell in love with Tian San Yue, who was secretly monitoring her—could she have chosen a better partner?—and San Yue, while faithfully carrying out his monitoring duties, also developed feelings for Qing Cao. The audience hoped that this pair of hardworking and honest young people would have a happy future. But after San Yue had a relationship with Qing Cao, he was still intimidated by the ghost and carried out the "family law" on her, resulting in a heartless tragedy. The white mountain ridge does not grow grass, and a young woman full of life was ultimately destroyed and sacrificed for her husband. But under the shadow of the ghost, who else became a sacrificial offering besides this young woman!

What is even more shocking and thought-provoking is that the one who carried out the "family law" was someone who, like the victim, had committed the same "crime" and shared the same fate. Is the slow pace of historical development not also due to the fact that among the oppressed, there are still those who are willing to be sacrificed for decaying things? When that "cowardly wild dog" pounced on Qing Cao, his hands around her neck, even the merciless white mountain ridge seemed to want to weep!

This television drama has a strong visual impact, with a unique tragic atmosphere created by the combination of images and music. The character of Li Qing Cao is well-crafted. However, the process of conflict leading to the tragedy and the inner struggles of the characters in this process are still relatively simple. Nevertheless, through a tangible and colorful love tragedy with a modern mythical flavor, and a human tragedy where the dead control the lives of the living, the drama creates an image of a ghost that is almost formless yet omnipresent. It allows the audience to feel and understand a kind of feudal sacrificial ideology and its lingering influence, which is a unique discovery.

In real life, people like Tian Mu Gen are rare, but the shadow of the Tian Mu Gen-style ghost is not limited to the white mountain ridge. May the grass spread across the horizon, and may the world be green!

　　但愿青草遍天涯
    ——看电视剧《白色山岗》
    余倩
    剧里描述了一场爱情悲剧，一场神州大地特产的、不仅仅是爱情的人间惨剧，造成这惨剧的竟是一个长眠地下的党支部书记，一个幽灵。
    像这样贫瘠、这样荒凉的小山村，在影视作品中，现在几乎被遗忘了。没有个体户发财致富的热闹和辉煌，没有迪斯科和流行音乐……这是白色的山岗，人们似乎生活在遥远的年代，连山歌也像从千钧重荷下撕裂了肺腑发出的原始的生命呼叫。在急欲超前进入“娱乐时代”的人们眼里，这部电视剧，可能不那么入时和有趣。作为除了需要娱乐，也还需要能够维系娱乐的生存条件的观众，面对屏幕上这些看来有些陌生，其实相当亲近的山野同胞及其境遇，也会无动于衷吗？电视中显赫的支部书记已经不少见，但有谁见过一个死去的支书，仍在主宰活人的命运么？这像是荒诞不经的神话，然而却是严酷的现实。
    “乌鸦死了不肯闭眼”，群众说这个外号乌鸦的支书田木根，是舍不得年轻漂亮的媳妇；却不知这个死也不肯放弃生前所拥有的一切的一村之主，对身后事早有安排。他没有可能像古代帝王那样营造地下宫殿和让活人活马随同自己入土长眠；也不像现代东方先进的工业国家顶礼膜拜的神圣那样时髦，把最心爱的物事包括电影明星的名单带进棺材。但他有自己对古代统治者既有继承、也有发展的安排后事的特殊方式。临终前亲自授名组成了新的领导班子；而对如何管束自己的妻子，则作了更精心、更见独创的秘密布置：让放羊汉田三月对她暗中监视，并随时到他坟前汇报监视的结果，妻子如有不轨行为，便要三月对她施行“家法”。这样他虽然死去了，他的幽灵却无所不在，整个村子和他的家庭，依然在没有田木根的田木根管辖之下。那座威然、俨然耸立的山岗上的坟墓（让人不禁想到骊山脚下那座庞然的皇陵），仿佛日夜都在俯视和镇守着全村，成了一种凛然不可犯的统治的象征。白色山岗的人们，就在这幽灵的阴影下生活，“来去赤条条，今天我埋你，明天埋咱们”……就像白色的山岗那样缺乏生机，那样让人感到仿佛亘古如斯的苍凉和悲哀。
    然而田木根的妻子李青草，却不愿受幽灵的摆布，连别人称她“木根嫂”而不称她自己的名字也很厌恶。她外表平和内里刚强，颇具齐鲁山野人民的朴直气概，就像青草一样富于生命力。不幸她爱上了秘密监视她的田三月——她还有可能选择更好的对象吗？——而三月在忠实执行监视任务的过程，也对青草发生好感。观众期待这对勤劳淳朴的男女青年，会有幸福的未来。不料三月在和青草发生关系后，又慑于地下幽灵有知，竟对她执行了“家法”，演成了一场灭绝人性的惨剧。白色山岗不生青草，一个富于生命力的年轻妇女，终于受到无情的摧残而为丈夫殉葬。但在幽灵阴影下成为殉葬品的，岂止一个年轻的妇女！
    令人震惊、也令人深思的还在于：执行“家法”的，原是和被害者同样犯“法”，有着同样命运的人。历史发展的缓慢，不是也由于被奴役的人中，还有甘为腐朽事物殉葬的么？当那个“有心无胆的野狗子”扑向青草，双手掐住她的脖子的时候，连无情的白色山岗仿佛也要哭泣！
    这部电视剧有较强的造型表现力，画面和音乐结合而有特殊动人的悲剧气氛，李青草的形象塑造相当真切。只是酿成悲剧的矛盾发展过程和处于这种过程的人物内心的表现还较简单。然而通过一种有形有色的、不无现代神话意味的爱情悲剧，一种死人主宰活人命运的人间惨剧，塑造了一个几乎等于无形而又无所不在的幽灵的形象，让人感受和领会了一种封建专制的殉葬思想和遗风，却是一种独特的形象发现。
    实际生活中，像田木根这样具体的人是罕见的，而田木根式幽灵的阴影未必只在白色山岗。但愿青草遍天涯，绿满人间！
