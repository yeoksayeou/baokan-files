Chengdu has been diligently implementing the policy of "rectification, adjustment, and reform." This year, the market has moved from a state of fluctuation and chaos towards stability and prosperity. There is a good trend of increased buying and selling, a gradual decrease in the rate of price increases, an increase in savings deposits, and accelerated currency withdrawal.

Statistics show that Chengdu's total retail sales of social commodities in the first quarter of this year increased by 23.2% compared to the same period last year. Urban and rural savings deposits increased by 12.2% compared to the beginning of the year, and the plan for currency withdrawal was overfulfilled. The retail price index in the first quarter increased by 29.8% compared to the same period last year, but compared to the fourth quarter of last year, it decreased by 8.4 percentage points. Excluding the price increase factors from the second half of last year, the new price increase is less than one-tenth. The rate of price increases is showing a downward trend.

The supply of major staple foods and vegetables is sufficient, and prices are stable or even decreasing. The price of pork has remained relatively stable. The prices of famous cigarettes and liquor have seen a significant "drop." The supply of major industrial products such as color TVs, refrigerators, bicycles, soap, detergent, and cotton and wool textiles has exceeded previous years, with prices fluctuating but the trend of price increases has been curbed. The public's "fear of price increases" mentality has eased, and the phenomenon of blindly rushing to buy has begun to disappear.

Chengdu Deputy Mayor He Youshen told the reporter that the fundamental reason for the good situation in Chengdu's market is that the national macro-control has taken effect.

　　涨价幅度趋减　货币回笼加快    
    成都市场走向平稳
    本报成都４月２６日电  记者罗茂城报道：成都市认真贯彻“治理、整顿、改革”的方针，今年市场从波动混乱的困境中走向平稳繁荣，出现了购销两旺、物价上升幅度逐月下降、储蓄存款增加、货币回笼加快的良好势头。
    据统计，成都市今年一季度与去年同期相比，社会商品零售总额增长２３．２％；城乡储蓄比年初增长１２．２％，货币回笼超额完成计划。一季度零售物价指数比去年同期上升２９．８％，但与去年第四季度相比，下降８．４个百分点，剔除去年下半年涨价因素，新涨价部分不到一成。物价上升幅度已呈下降之势。
    群众最关心的主要副食品和蔬菜，供应充足，价格稳中有降。猪肉牌价和集市价一直较平稳。名烟名酒价格大幅度“滑坡”。主要工业品如彩电、冰箱、自行车、肥皂、洗衣粉、棉毛织品等，投放市场量都超过往年，价格有升有降，但涨价趋势已有所遏制。群众的“恐价”心理有所缓解，盲目争购的现象开始消失。
    成都市副市长何用先告诉记者，成都市场出现良好的局面，最根本的原因是国家宏观控制产生了效力。
