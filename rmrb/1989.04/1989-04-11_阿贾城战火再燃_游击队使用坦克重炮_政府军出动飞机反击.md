	Afghanistan's Ajdah City has once again become a battleground. On the 9th, Afghan Mujahideen launched a large-scale assault on the city. The battle for Ajdah City has been ongoing for a month. This attack came after a week of relative calm.

	According to sources from the Mujahideen, the targets of the attack were the government forces' 81st Brigade base located on the outskirts of Ajdah City and the Ajdah City airport, which was closed last month. The Mujahideen used tanks and heavy artillery captured during the fighting.

	Kabul Radio reported that the government forces immediately dispatched fighter jets for a counterattack, killing 195 Mujahideen fighters.

	Meanwhile, the Mujahideen also launched attacks on the cities of Host and Qadiz in Paktiya Province.
