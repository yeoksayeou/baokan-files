    "People can stay at home and send or receive goods nationwide," is how some customers evaluate China's road transport sector's development of small-lot freight services.

    It is reported that China's road transport small-lot freight services have initially formed a nationwide network centered on cities, with main routes as the backbone, combining long and short distances, and connecting main and branch routes.

    According to incomplete statistics, there are currently 2,500 dedicated freight vehicles nationwide, 2,200 operational routes, an annual freight volume of 2.2 million tons, and an annual turnover of over 600 million ton-kilometers. At present, except for a few remote provinces and regions, all have opened bus routes. Many provinces and cities have achieved county-level coverage, and the production, operation, and coordination management of small-lot freight services have gradually been standardized and regulated.

    With the development of the commodity economy, new demands have emerged in customer service and transportation methods for small-lot freight services. Small-lot freight services, compared to full-truckload services, require more capital investment due to their stronger service orientation. Therefore, it is necessary to provide some support to small-lot freight enterprises. It is revealed that relevant parties are preparing to establish a nationwide small-lot freight coordination organization to promote the further development of automobile small-lot freight transportation.

　　汽车零担货运全国初成网络
    新华社北京４月２１日电（实习生姜歆远）“人在家中坐，收发全国货”，这是一些客户对我国公路汽车开展零担运输的良好评价。
    据介绍，我国公路汽车货物零担运输已初步形成以城市为中心、以干线为骨架、长短结合、干支相通的四通八达的全国性运输网络。
    据不完全统计，全国已有专用货车２５００辆，营运线路２２００条，年货运量２２０万吨，年周转量６亿余吨公里。目前，除个别边远省区外，都开通了班车线路，不少省市实现县县有线路，零担运输的生产经营和协调管理已逐步实行标准化和规范化。
    随着商品经济的发展，零担运输在客户服务、运输方式方面出现了新的要求。零担运输由于比整车运输的服务性更强，需要更多的资金投入，因此必须给零担运输企业一定的扶持。据透露，有关方面正着手筹建一个全国性的零担运输协调机构，以促进汽车零担货物运输的进一步发展。
