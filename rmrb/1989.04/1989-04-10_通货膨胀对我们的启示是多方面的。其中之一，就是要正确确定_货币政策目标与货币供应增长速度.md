Inflation has had a detrimental impact on the lives of the people, economic construction, and system reforms in our country in recent years. Therefore, the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee made the decision to rectify the economic environment, rectify economic order, and deepen reforms comprehensively. Subsequently, the Party Central Committee and the State Council took a series of corresponding measures. These measures are starting to have positive effects. In addition to continuing to take measures to further stabilize currency value and prices, we should also calmly reflect on what lessons we can learn from this bout of inflation. This involves many issues. Below, I will discuss my personal views on the issue of how to determine the goals of our country's monetary policy and the rate of money supply growth.

To promote the smooth development of the national economy, our country's monetary policy should aim directly at stabilizing currency value and prices.

Regarding the issue of monetary policy goals, there have long been differing opinions in our country's academic circles. Some believe that currency value stability should be the sole goal; others believe that economic development and currency value stability should be dual goals; still others advocate for a policy similar to Western countries, with goals such as economic development, currency value stability, full employment, and balance of payments, or even more.

The experience of inflation in recent years has proven that the first view is closer to our country's actual situation. Our country's monetary policy should aim directly at stabilizing currency value and prices.

Why is this the case?

Firstly, the multi-goal monetary policy of the West is not suitable for our current situation. Among their four goals, the issue of labor employment, in our country, is still basically managed by the state. Regardless of the state of currency circulation and production, the state does not allow the phenomenon of large-scale unemployment to occur. At the same time, under our current system, the impact of monetary policy on labor employment is not significant, so it is not necessary to list it as a goal of monetary policy. The issue of foreign exchange receipts and payments is still basically controlled by the state according to the national plan and foreign exchange policy, and monetary policy does not play a significant role.

Secondly, the dual-goal theory is not conducive to currency value stability. Stabilizing currency value and developing the economy are not goals at the same level. Stabilizing currency value and prices is the direct goal of monetary policy, while developing the economy is one of the main goals of stabilizing currency. In other words, developing the economy is the goal or indirect goal of monetary policy goals. Stabilizing currency is a prerequisite for economic development. Only when currency value and prices are stable can the economy develop in a healthy and smooth manner. Therefore, the direct goal of monetary policy is to stabilize currency value and prices, and indirectly but more effectively promote economic development.

If we list economic development as one of the direct goals of monetary policy, the starting point is to emphasize the importance of economic development, but in reality, it reduces the importance of economic development. Developing the economy is the overall goal of various economic policies, including monetary policy, not the direct goal of monetary policy. At the same time, the dual-goal theory also disperses the focus of monetary policy, making it unable to concentrate all efforts on stabilizing currency, which is not conducive to the stability of currency value and prices.

Those who believe that monetary policy must have dual goals, to a certain extent, have opposed economic development to currency stability, and do not believe that stabilizing currency is conducive to economic development. The positive and negative experiences of our country have repeatedly proven that under our socialist system, only when the currency is stable can the economy develop smoothly.

Our country's current economy is relatively backward, and everyone wants to develop quickly in economic construction. If economic development is listed as a direct goal of monetary policy and it is emphasized that monetary policy should directly serve economic construction, it may become a basis for various parties to demand that banks increase loans, forcing banks to issue more currency and create inflation, bringing very bad effects to economic construction.

To stabilize currency value, the growth rate of money supply should not exceed the growth rate of national income. In terms of money supply and credit issuance, it should serve the tilted industrial policy.

Closely related to the correct determination of our country's monetary policy goals is the issue of how to correctly determine the amount and growth rate of our country's money supply.

In recent years, the fundamental reason for the occurrence of inflation in our country is the overheating of the economy, the excessive scale of construction, and the rapid growth of consumption funds. However, failing to adhere to the principle of determining the amount of money supply according to the economic growth situation also has a certain relationship. This is something that needs to be improved urgently in the future.

Firstly, it is necessary to establish the idea of increasing the money supply (including transfer money, the same below) only according to the economic growth rate, and formulate corresponding operating procedures. The economic growth rate is indicated by the national income. For example, if the national income is expected to grow by 10%, the money supply and currency issuance can only grow by 10% on the basis of the end of last year. Violating this principle and supplying more money than the national income growth rate, as in the situation in our country since 1984, will inevitably lead to currency devaluation and price increases. The reason is simple: under the condition that the inventory of commodities in the commodity society does not change much, the part of the national income this year that is equal to the national income last year already has the original currency in the market as a means of circulation and payment, and does not need new currency; the new currency needed is the means of circulation and payment for the part of the national income this year that is greater than last year. Therefore, in general, the money supply should grow by the same percentage as the national income this year compared to last year on the basis of the end of last year. From the point of view of the normal operation of the economy, this is already sufficient. If you still want to issue a little more currency, you can only increase it by one to two percentage points (according to domestic and foreign experience, an annual price increase of 1-2% is usually acceptable to the public) outside the above range, but absolutely cannot exceed this limit to issue more currency.

When calculating the money supply and issuance, is it necessary to add the factor of the slowdown in the turnover speed of money? Currently, it is not necessary. In the case of excessive currency issuance and obvious price increases, the turnover speed of money usually only speeds up and does not slow down. As for the fact that due to the shortage of commodities, some money cannot buy the corresponding commodities, and many people hold money waiting to buy, this is not a slowdown in the turnover speed of money, an increase in the market demand for money, but a manifestation of the existence of excess money in the market.

It should be noted that in recent years, when we talked about the slowdown in the turnover speed of money, it was actually mainly a reflection of the improvement in the degree of commodification of the total social output, that is, the same total social output, due to the improvement in the degree of commodification, the required amount of money will increase accordingly. Under the condition that the turnover speed of money does not change, it is indeed necessary to issue a certain amount of money accordingly. But everyone knows that the degree of commodification of the total social output has significantly improved in the early years of the reform, and now there is no significant change. Therefore, if the so-called factor of the slowdown in the turnover speed of money (actually referring to the factor of the improvement in the degree of commodification of the total social output) is added to the calculation of the money supply and currency issuance growth rate, it can only promote the supply of money exceeding objective needs.

When calculating the money growth rate, adding the factor of structural price adjustment, that is, taking the planned increase in the prices of some commodities by the state as a factor for the corresponding increase in currency issuance, is also questionable. If the market currency is normal and the total supply is basically balanced with the total demand, only the price structure is unreasonable, with some prices too low and some too high, then the prices that should be raised should be raised, and the prices that should be lowered should be lowered, which should not affect the overall price level, and thus there is no need to increase the money supply. Even if some commodity prices are raised, they absorb some purchasing power, forcing other commodities to passively reduce prices, it will not have an adverse effect on economic development because the prices that are reduced are mostly long-term or non-marketable commodities. If the market currency is excessive, measures should be taken to timely withdraw the excess currency. At this time, even if some commodity prices are raised, there will be no shortage of currency. Taking structural price adjustment as a factor for increasing currency issuance will lead to the money supply exceeding objective needs.

If the money supply increase rate in 1988 was determined only according to the national income growth rate (or plus one or two percentage points), then the money supplied by the bank would have to be significantly reduced. Would this affect the development of the national economy? No. After all, economic construction must rely on corresponding materials, not on issuing more currency. The national income only increased by so much that year, and the excess currency issued without corresponding materials could only devalue the currency, increase prices, and disrupt the order of commodity transactions. As a result, many construction projects could not buy construction materials and had to extend the construction period, and some became half-finished projects; many factories could not complete their production plans due to a lack of raw materials. From an overall perspective, the economic growth rate is not accelerated but slowed down, and economic efficiency is not improved but reduced. On the contrary, issuing currency according to the national income growth rate, the currency has a solid material foundation, and when it is invested in basic construction or production and operation fields, it can achieve the expected goals. Only then can the entire economy operate in an orderly and sustainable manner. From a longer-term perspective, the economic growth rate will be faster.

When issuing currency according to the national income growth rate, to mobilize the materials of the whole society and give full play to their role in production, it is also necessary to promote the adjustment of the industrial structure according to a certain industrial policy. To this end, in financial work, in addition to actively carrying out savings activities and transforming more consumption funds into production funds, it is also necessary to adhere to the principle of differentiated treatment in money supply and credit issuance. According to our country's actual situation, in the future, the funds for the purchase of grain, cotton, and other agricultural and sideline products should be guaranteed first. This item of funds should be listed separately and managed separately, and fully supplied during the purchase and gradually recovered during the sale, not mixed with other loans. After guaranteeing the funds needed for the purchase of grain and cotton, the remaining money supply and loan amount is the total money supply and loan amount that can be used for other aspects this year. In the process of system transformation, the self-regulation mechanism of enterprises has not yet been fully established, and it is necessary to combine administrative measures and economic measures to strengthen macro-control. In the control of loans, it is necessary to overcome the phenomenon of "one-size-fits-all." Different industries should be treated differently; for different enterprises, it is also necessary to treat them differently according to their management and product sales situation. Only in this way can these limited funds be used in the most needed areas of production and construction to play the most effective role.

　　通货膨胀对我们的启示是多方面的。其中之一，就是要正确确定——
    货币政策目标与货币供应增长速度
    赵海宽
    我国近年来的通货膨胀，已对人民生活、经济建设和体制改革带来了不良影响。因此，党的十三届三中全会作出治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革的决定，接着党中央和国务院又采取了一系列相应的措施。这些措施正在产生积极效果。现在我们除了需要继续采取措施进一步稳定币值和物价外，还应该冷静地想想，这次通货膨胀可使我们得到哪些启示。这涉及许多问题。下面仅就我国货币政策的目标及货币供应量增长速度应如何确定的问题谈点个人看法。
    为了促进国民经济的顺利发展，我国的货币政策应该以稳定币值和物价作为直接目标。
    关于货币政策目标问题，在我国理论界长期存在不同看法，有的认为应把稳定币值作为单一目标；有的认为应以发展经济和稳定币值作为双重目标；还有些人主张类似西方国家那样，以发展经济、稳定币值、充分就业和国际收支平衡四个或更多的内容为目标。近年来通货膨胀的事实证明，第一种看法接近我国实际情况，我国的货币政策应以稳定币值和物价作为直接目标。
    为什么这样说呢？
    首先，西方的多目标货币政策不适合于我国现在的情况。在他们的四个目标中，劳动力就业问题，我国截至现在，基本上还是由国家包着，不管货币流通和生产状况怎样，国家不允许出现大批劳动力失业的现象，同时，在我国现行体制下，货币政策对劳动就业的作用不大，因此还没有必要列为货币政策的目标。外汇收支问题，我国现仍基本上按照国家计划和外汇政策掌握着，货币政策不发挥重要作用。
    其次，双重目标论不利于币值的稳定。稳定币值和发展经济不是同一层次的目标。稳定币值和物价是货币政策的直接目标，发展经济又是稳定货币的主要目标之一。换句话说，发展经济是货币政策目标的目标或间接目标。稳定货币是发展经济的前提条件，只有币值和物价稳定，经济才能健康而顺利地发展。因此货币政策的直接目标就是稳定币值和物价，并以此间接地然而是更好地促进经济的发展。
    如果我们把发展经济列为货币政策的直接目标之一，出发点是重视经济的发展，实际上反而降低了发展经济的重要地位。发展经济是各项经济政策，当然也包括货币政策的总目标，而不是货币政策的直接目标。同时，双重目标论也使货币政策的注意力分散，不能集中全力于稳定货币，对币值和物价的稳定不利。
    认为货币政策必须有双重目标，在一定程度上是把发展经济同稳定货币对立了起来，不相信稳定货币有利于发展经济。我国的正反经验都反复证明了，在我国社会主义制度下，只有货币稳定了，经济才能顺利发展。
    我国当前经济比较落后，在经济建设上大家都想快上、大上。如把发展经济列为货币政策的直接目标，强调货币政策直接为经济建设服务，就可能成为各方面要求银行多增贷款，迫使银行增发货币，制造通货膨胀的根据，给经济建设带来很坏的影响。
    为了稳定币值，货币供应的增长速度不应超过国民生产总值的增长速度。在货币供应与信贷发放上，要为倾斜的产业政策服务。
    与正确确定我国货币政策目标问题紧密相联的是，如何正确确定我国货币供应数量及其增长速度的问题。
    近年来我国出现通货膨胀，根本原因当然是经济过热，基建规模过大，消费基金增长过快，然而不能坚持按经济增长情况确定货币供应数量，也有一定的关系。这是今后急需加以改进的。
    首先，要确立只按经济增长幅度增加货币供应量（包括转帐货币，下同）的思想，并制定相应的操作办法。经济增长幅度以国民生产总值为标志。例如，国民生产总值预计增长１０％，货币供应和货币发行量也只能在上年底基础上增长１０％。违背这一原则，超过国民生产总值增长率而多供应货币，如１９８４年以来我国出现的情况那样，就必然引起货币贬值和物价上涨。原因很简单：在商品社会库存量变化不大的条件下，当年国民生产总值中同上年国民生产总值相等的部分，已有市场上原有的货币量作为流通和支付手段，不需要新增货币；需要新增的货币，就是国民生产总值当年大于上年部分所需要的流通和支付手段。因此，一般说来，国民生产总值当年比上年增长多大幅度，货币供应量在上年底基础上也就应该增长多大幅度。从经济正常运转的需要来说，这已经足够。如果还想多发一点票子，那也只能在上述幅度之外，多增加一到两个百分点（根据国内外的经验，每年物价上涨１—２％，通常群众还能够承受），而绝不能超过这个限度更多增发货币。
    在计算货币供应和发行量时，是否需要加进货币周转速度减慢的因素？从当前来说是不需要的。在货币已经投放过多、物价明显上涨的情况下，货币周转速度通常只会加快，而不会减慢的。至于由于商品供不应求，部分货币买不到相应的商品，不少人持币待购，那不是货币周转速度减慢，市场货币需要量增加，而是市场上存在多余货币的表现。
    需要说明的是，近些年来我们讲的货币周转速度减慢，实际上主要是社会总产值商品化程度提高的反映，即同样的社会总产值，由于商品化程度的提高，需要的货币量会相应增加。这在货币流通速度不变的条件下，的确需要相应地增发一定量的货币与之相适应。但人们都知道，社会总产值的商品化程度，在改革初期几年曾显著提高过，现在已无明显变化。因此，现在再把所谓货币周转速度减慢的因素（实际上指的是社会总产值商品化程度提高的因素），放进货币供应和货币发行量增加率的计算之内，就只能促使超过客观需要多供应货币。
    在计算货币增长率时，加进结构性物价调整的因素，即把国家对部分物价的有计划调高作为相应增发货币的因素，也是值得商榷的。如果市场货币量正常，总供给同总需求基本平衡，只是物价结构不合理，有的定价偏低，有的定价偏高，则该提高的提高，该降低的降低，不应该影响物价总水平，从而也不需要增加货币供应量。即使部分商品价格提高多吸收了一些购买力，迫使另一些商品被动降价，也由于降价的多为长线或不对路商品，不会对经济发展带来不利影响。如果市场货币量偏多，应该采取措施及时回笼偏多的货币，这时即使部分商品价格调高，也不会发生货币短缺现象。把结构性价格调整作为增发货币的因素，将会导致货币供应量超过客观需要。
    如果１９８８年只按国民生产总值增长率（或再多一两个百分点）确定货币供应增加率，则银行供应的货币就要大大减少。这会不会影响国民经济的发展？不会。归根到底，经济建设必须依靠相应的物资，而不能依靠多发票子。当年国民生产总值只增长那么多，超过这一基础多发的货币，没有对应的物资，只能使货币贬值，物价上涨，商品交易秩序紊乱，社会物资重新分配。结果招致许多基建项目买不到建设物资而延长工期，有的成为半拉子工程；许多工厂因原材料不足不能完成生产计划。这从整体看，经济增长速度不是加快反而会减慢，经济效益不是提高而是降低。相反，按照国民生产总值的增长速度去增发货币，货币就有坚实的物资基础，投向基本建设或生产、经营领域，就能达到预期目标，整个经济才能有秩序地、持续地运行，从长一些时间看，经济增长速度反而快些。
    在按国民生产总值增长率增发货币时，为了调动全社会的物资，充分发挥它们在生产中的作用，还有必要根据一定的产业政策有计划地促进产业结构的调整。为此，在金融工作中除积极开展储蓄活动，把更多的消费基金转化为生产资金外，还要坚持货币供应和信贷发放的区别对待原则。根据我国实际情况，今后粮食、棉花等农副产品收购资金首先要保证供应。此项资金应单列帐户，专项管理，收购时充分供应，销售时逐渐收回，不同其它贷款混同。在保证了粮食、棉花收购所需资金后，剩余的货币供应量和贷款额就是当年能够使用于其它方面的全部货币量和贷款额。在体制转换过程中，企业的自我调控机制尚未充分建立，要配合使用行政办法和经济办法，加强宏观控制。贷款掌握上要克服“一刀切”现象。对不同产业实行区别对待；对各个企业，也要根据经营管理和产品销售状况，切实做到区别对待。这样才能使这些仅有的资金，用到生产建设最需要的方面，以发挥最充分的作用。
