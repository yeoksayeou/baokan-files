The Call of the Soul
—After Watching the TV Series "Teacher's Soul"

A Qing Dynasty poet wrote, "Scholars shed tears in vain, scattered by the east wind at dusk." (Huáng Jǐngrén: "Miscellaneous Feelings") When Fan Shaobo repeatedly expresses his inner thoughts, "I do not want... I want...," his heart must also be filled with tears of concern for the times. He is indeed a man of true character and integrity. Only someone who is deeply troubled, with a heart full of sorrow and longing, can express such moving verses. The main theme poem of the entire drama is simple and elegant, yet it carries the momentum of a poet who, after reciting, lowers his head with no place to write. Li Bǎotiān recites it in a low, slow, and seemingly calm tone, but it is clear that he cannot hide Fan Shaobo's inner emotions of twists and turns, sadness, and indignation. After watching "Teacher's Soul," my thoughts surged, and my eyes, which have been dry for many years, unknowingly became moist.

Who would have thought that in today's world, reading is difficult and teaching is even more difficult! If we include all the direct and indirect experiences of humanity, tangible and intangible cultural knowledge, then from childhood to old age, who can avoid receiving education in one way or another? From the perspective of a large culture and large education, whether a whole nation possesses the cultural quality to open up and advance into the new century and new life will depend on the effective density of the educational structure network and the level of scientific and technological knowledge distribution, mastery, and application among members of society. Whether knowledge and wisdom are respected can roughly determine its position on the track of the times. From this perspective, the "Teacher's Soul" that "Teacher's Soul" advocates is not only about the duties and responsibilities of a teacher but also about the spirit of the people and the soul of the nation.

"By nature, all people want to gain knowledge" (Aristotle: "Metaphysics"). Some Western scholars further believe that seeking knowledge, feeling, and acting encompass the entire range of human behavior. "Teacher's Soul" does not follow the old model of writing about conflicts caused by different educational ideologies or methods within the school, but with great sincerity, it focuses on depicting the pursuit of knowledge, understanding, and truth by both teachers and students in the small classroom of the school and the large classroom of life. It depicts their mutual understanding and actions in facing various situations in life. In this way, it raises and answers a question that current educational theme TV works urgently need to address: How should we view education? Can we understand Fan Shaobo, who "fears to fall in love with the path of longing" but is willing to be a teacher? If we rationally reflect on the verses that Fan Shaobo repeatedly recites, and genuinely appreciate people's earnest pursuit of knowledge and truth in shaping their own souls and choosing their life values, and are willing to be lifelong wanderers in the forest of knowledge, and sincerely hope that our nation can become a nation soaring in the universe of wisdom, then we will surely feel that the renewal and reconstruction of educational concepts are indeed urgent. We no longer have the right and time to miss the best opportunity for deepening educational reforms! The theme expressed by the TV series "Teacher's Soul" is actually such a call of the soul. Although the conflicts and contradictions it presents are somewhat idealized compared to the current state and prospects of educational reform, it wishes that the whole society can understand the work of teachers like Fan from the perspective of renewing educational concepts, support the choices made by young people for the future from the perspective of changing values, and further appeal to turn around the neglect of education from the perspective of the overall deployment of the Four Modernizations. These have universal and far-reaching significance. It should be said that this is also the brilliance of "Teacher's Soul" compared to similar theme works.

Li Bǎotiān's portrayal of Fan Shaobo is very distinctive. In the dual creation of endowing the role with life and inevitably imprinting the performer's personality, his pursuit of high relaxation and freedom and restraint from embellishment is more conscious than in "Ge Shopkeeper," and thus in the performance style, he has "dispersed" the character of Fan Shaobo, who is simple and natural. Some brilliant scenes, which were improvised on the spot and completed in one take, are worth summarizing. For example, in the final scene of the party, when Fan Teacher is pushed onto the stage to sing folk songs, his performance of imitating a donkey's bray with childlike joy, which brings laughter from the audience, is unrestrained and perfectly integrated with the character and the situation at that moment, which is a masterpiece.

　　心灵的呼唤
　　——电视剧《师魂》观后
　　刘扬体
    清代诗人有句云：“书生空有忧时泪，洒向东风到夕曛。”（黄景仁：《杂感》）范少波在反复倾诉自己的心曲“我不愿……我却想……”时，心中一定也充满了忧时的热泪。他确乎是个具有真性情的真君子。唯忧思百结、回肠九转、五内俱热的人，方能吐露出那样动人心弦的诗句来。全剧主题诗简淡清丽，内蓄着吟罢低眉无写处的气势；李保田以低沉徐缓、貌似平稳的语调朗诵出来，却又分明掩饰不住范少波宛转低昂、悲矜激楚的内在情绪。看完《诗魂》，思绪鹊起，我多年少泪的眼角竟不知不觉地湿润起来。
    谁会想到在今天读书难教书更难呢！如果把人类直接间接经验的结晶，有形无形的文化知识都算在内的话，一个人自幼及老，有谁离得开以这样或那样的方式接受教育呢？从大文化大教育的角度看，整个民族是否具有向新世纪新生活开拓前进的文化素质，必将取决于全社会教育结构网络化的有效密度，与网络化的科学技术知识在社会成员间分布、掌握与运用的水平，是否尊重知识与智慧的价值，即可大致不差地测出其在时代轨道上运行的位置。以此观之，《师魂》所张扬的“师魂”，非止于师德师责之所在，亦且民魂国魄之所系也。
    “从本性上讲，所有的人都想获得知识”（亚里士多德：《形而上学》）。西方一些学者进而认为，求知、感受和行动，这三者包容了人类行为的整个范围。《师魂》没有按照旧的模式去写校园内两种教育思想或教育方法之类引起的冲突，而以极大的热诚注重描绘师生双方在校园小课堂和生活大课堂里求知求识求真的追求，描绘他们在共同直面人生的种种境遇中，相互走入彼此心灵的感受和行动。这样就从总体上提出和回答了当前教育题材影视作品亟待回答的一个问题：我们究竟应当怎样看待教育？我们能否理解“钟情怕到相思路”不愿却甘愿当老师的范少波？如果我们对范少波反复吟诵的诗句作出理性的思索，打心眼里赞赏人们在自我心灵塑造和人生价值观念选择上，对于求知求真，对于精神富有的苦心追求，因而乐意做一个终生能在知识的森林里漫步的人，并且衷心希望我们民族能够成为在智慧的宇宙间翔飞的民族，那就一定会加倍感到教育观念的更新和再建实在刻不容缓。我们已没有权利和时间将深化教改的佳期一误再误！电视剧《师魂》所表达的主题，其实正是这样一种心灵的呼唤。虽然，它所展现的矛盾冲突，相对于教改的现状与前景说来，带有某些浅近的理想化的色彩，但它祈愿全社会都能从教育观念的更新上，理解范老师们的工作，从价值观念转变上，支持青少年对未来作出的选择，进而呼吁从四化的整体部署上，扭转对教育的轻视。这些却有着普遍的深远的意义。应该说，这也正是《师魂》较之同类题材作品的高明之处。
    李保田扮演的范少波很有特色。他在赋予角色生命又必然打上表演者个性印记的二元创造里，对高度松弛自由与力戒雕饰的追求，较之《葛掌柜》更为自觉，因而在表演风格上把范少波这个本色质朴的人物“散文化”了。有些精彩片断，在拍摄现场一气呵成的即兴表演，很值得总结。如剧末联欢会一场，范老师被推拥上台演唱山歌时，他那充满童趣地学“驴叫”引来哄堂大笑的表演，酣畅淋漓，且与剧中人此时此情浑然一体，堪称一绝。
