The Marvelous Substance - Trehalose

Trehalose is known as a magical substance. It can sustain the life of certain plants and animals indefinitely without water. Scientists from countries like the UK and the USA are currently researching its applications.

Some plants and animals in the desert appear to be dead when there is no water, but they come back to life when water is added. Scientists have discovered that it is trehalose in the biological structure that maintains their life.

The foundation of all biological substances is the protein chain, and water molecules play a role in maintaining the protein chain. Without water molecules, the protein chain will be destroyed. Trehalose seems to act as a molecular "glue," replacing water molecules to maintain the protein chain and ensure the continuation of life.

Currently, the main areas of research for trehalose applications are in medicine and food. Adding trehalose to certain medications and vaccines allows them to be stored at room temperature without water and prevents degradation. Adding it to blood to create a dry powder allows for long-term storage at room temperature. Adding a small amount of trehalose to milk before making it into powdered milk can prevent protein degradation.

Trehalose is currently extracted and produced from yeast. However, this method is costly, with each kilogram costing 300 pounds. New fermentation technologies may reduce the cost to just 2 pounds per kilogram.

### 奇妙的物质——海藻糖

　　奇妙的物质——
    海藻糖
    海藻糖被称为神奇物质，它能够在没有水的情况下，无限期地维持某些动植物的生命。英、美等国科学家正在研究它的应用。
    沙漠中有些动植物，没有水时好像是死的，一加水就活了。科学家研究后发现，是生物结构中含有的海藻糖维持着它们的生命。
    所有生物物质的基础是蛋白质链，水分子起着维持蛋白质链的作用。没有水分子，蛋白质链就会遭到破坏。海藻糖似乎起着分子“胶”的作用，代替水分子维持蛋白质链，保证生命延续下去。
    目前，海藻糖应用的研究主要在医学和食品方面。把海藻糖加入某些药品和疫苗里，可以不用加水在室温下保存不致降解。把它加入血液里，制成干的粉末，可以在室温下长期保存。在牛奶中加少量的海藻糖再制成奶粉，就可以避免蛋白质降解。
    海藻糖目前从酵母中提取制成。但这种方法成本高，每公斤的费用达３００英镑。用新的发酵技术可能会使成本减到每公斤只有２英镑。
