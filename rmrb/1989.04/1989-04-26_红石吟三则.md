	Red Stone Ode in Three Parts
	Gu Jianzhong

	Stone Wall

	In the glow of the setting sun, a red fortress suddenly appears. The towering walls, standing tall and firm, are the fortress's guards, standing on the shoulders of the earth, defying the cruelty of wind and rain. They are also like a lover's strong chest, protecting love and the tender passion of the world. Though it is marked with countless scars from chisels and hammers, it still smiles, without pain or moan. Every line and angle is straight and unyielding. No matter how hard you strike it, it will not bend into a curve. Even if explosives send it into the sky filled with gunpowder, when it falls back to the ground, it will still become countless square shapes.

	Chiseling Stone

	Time has etched the marks of history on the old man's forehead, and the old man has chiseled the years of his life onto the red stone monument of history. Each block of red stone standing solemnly is a burial ground for the years, or a milestone of history. Ding-dang, ding-dang, the sound of the hammer striking away the burdens of time, the sparks flying from the hammer are symbols of human hope.

	Stone Spirit

	It is a barrier, protecting the beings who once hammered and chiseled it; it is a bridge to the heavens, guiding countless people to worship the wondrous realm; it is a path, leading desperate lives to eternal splendor; it is a long embankment, blocking the turbid currents of the world from entering pure hearts. Who says it can only crawl and never soar? It can also rise into the blue sky, blending its smile into the clouds.

	Its head, its face, its body, its heart, all are a fiery red, like a maiden's red lips; the blood-sweat of the father, the blood-milk of the mother, the blood-tears of the lover, all mixed with the ancient storms of the primordial era, poured into its vast body. After being tempered and refined by the primordial fire of mankind for thousands of years, it finally forged a fiery red life.

　　红石吟三则
    顾建中
    石壁
    霞光中，突兀出一座红色的城堡。那削立的巨墙，是城堡的护兵，挺立在大地的肩上，挡着风雨的暴虐侵淫。又像情人孔武有力的胸膛，护着爱心，护着人世中温柔的炽情。尽管它身上凿轨道道，伤痕累累，却依然微笑，没有痛苦与呻吟，周身上下只有直的棱角和线条。任你千砸万锤也决不弯曲成弧形，即使是炸药把它送上充满硝烟的天空，落回地面，仍化成千万个方正之身。
    凿石
    岁月在老人的额前刻下了历史的烙印，老人在历史的红碑上凿下了岁月的年龄。这一方方肃立的红石，是一个个岁月的埋葬，抑或是一段段历史的里程。叮当叮当，敲落的是光阴留下的累赘，锤下闪灼的火花，是人类希望的象征。
    石魂
    它是一道屏障，护卫着曾经锤它砸它的生灵；它是一架天桥，引渡芸芸众生朝拜美妙仙境；它是一条小路，将绝望的生命领向璀璨的永恒；它是一道长堤，阻止世俗的浊流涌进纯净的心灵。谁说它永远只是匍匐不能升腾，它也可以耸入蓝天，把笑容融进彩云。
    它的头它的脸它的躯体它的心，都是赤红赤红如少女的红唇；父亲含血的汗水母亲含血的乳汁情人含血的泪珠，随着洪荒远古的飓风注入它那广袤之身。再加上人类始祖的弥天荒火烘烤煎熬千百个世纪，终于冶炼出一个赤红的生命。
