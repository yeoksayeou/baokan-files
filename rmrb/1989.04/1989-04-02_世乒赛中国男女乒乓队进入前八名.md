The Chinese men's and women's table tennis teams have advanced to the top eight in the World Table Tennis Championships.

	The Chinese men's team played against the host team, West Germany, today, attracting over 5,000 spectators. After West Germany's men's team unexpectedly lost 2-5 to Belgium last night, they maintained strong morale and fought tenaciously against the world champion Chinese team. They managed to take two points from the Chinese newcomer Yu Shenlong. Fortunately, veteran players Chen Longcan and Teng Yi remained calm on the court, scoring three and two points respectively, helping the Chinese team win 5-2.

	The Chinese women's team took only 50 minutes to defeat Romania 3-0, securing their spot in the second stage. The second stage of the World Table Tennis Championships team event will conclude at 2 a.m. Beijing time on April 2. As of the time of this report, in the women's team A group, aside from China, the other qualifying spot is being contested between Czechoslovakia and Romania. In group B, South Korea and Japan remain undefeated and have secured their spots. In group C, Hong Kong has won both of their matches and has secured their spot; the Soviet Union and Hungary are competing for the remaining spot. The situation in group D is unclear, with North Korea defeating Bulgaria and Sweden 3-2 and 3-1 respectively, making their qualification likely.

	The men's team's top 16 teams are more evenly matched in strength compared to the women's teams, making the competition more intense. In group A, China has won both of their matches and is on the verge of qualifying. In group B, Sweden and South Korea both won 5-0 against Nigeria and Chinese Taipei today, securing their spots.

　　世乒赛中国男女乒乓队进入前八名
    本报多特蒙德４月１日电  记者刘小明、江建国报道：今天中国乒乓男队同联邦德国队交锋时，吸引了５０００多名观众为东道主加油。联邦德国男队昨晚意外地以２∶５败给比利时队后，士气不减，与世界冠军中国队比赛时依然斗志顽强，从中国新手于沈潼身上取下两分。幸亏老将陈龙灿、滕毅临场镇静，分别得了三分和两分，中国队才以５∶２取胜。
    中国女队仅用５０分钟以３∶０轻取罗马尼亚队后，稳获第二阶段出线权。世乒赛团体赛第二阶段比赛将于北京时间４月２日凌晨全部结束。截至发稿时，女子团体Ａ组除中国队出线外，另一个出线名额由捷克斯洛伐克队和罗马尼亚队争夺。Ｂ组南朝鲜队、日本队保持不败，肯定出线。Ｃ组香港队两战两胜，出线已定局；苏联队和匈牙利队争夺另一席位。Ｄ组形势不甚明朗，朝鲜队以３∶２、３∶１胜了保加利亚队和瑞典队，出线希望很大。
    男子团体前１６名各队实力比女子各队接近，争夺更为激烈。Ａ组中国队已两战两胜，出线在望；Ｂ组瑞典队和南朝鲜今天都以５∶０胜尼日利亚队和中国台北队，肯定出线。
