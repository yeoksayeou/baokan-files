The People's Daily reports: Correspondent Tong Gulike reports: The National Gesar Work Leading Group recently held a symposium on the epic "Geser" in Beijing. The Qinghai Province Gesar Epic Research Institute reported on its recent work, and Tibetan folk artist Cai Rang Wangdu performed excerpts from "Geser."

The 57-year-old Cai Rang Wangdu, who is illiterate, has a natural talent, works hard, and loves "Geser." He can perform more than 120 episodes of "Geser." His performance is vivid and fluent.

"Geser" is a folk legend circulating among the Tibetan and Mongolian peoples. King Geser is a well-known hero in the areas where Tibetans and Mongolians live. Many countries around the world have specialized research on "Geser." "Geser" has become an international research topic.

In recent years, China has made some achievements in the sorting and research of "Geser," establishing many research institutions. In 1987, Qinghai Province held the first "Geser" Epic Folk Artist Performance Festival, discovering many artists, including Cai Rang Wangdu. This symposium affirmed the past achievements and raised many issues, summarizing the work of the Qinghai Gesar Research Institute.

　　藏族艺人进京说唱
　　《格萨尔》已成国际性研究课题
    本报讯　记者童古丽珂报道：全国《格萨尔》工作领导小组不久前在北京召开史诗《格萨尔》研讨会。青海省《格萨尔》史诗研究所汇报了近年工作情况，藏族民间艺人才让旺堆说唱了《格萨尔》的片断。
    现年５７岁的才让旺堆，一字不识，凭着他的天赋、勤奋和对《格萨尔》的热爱，能够演唱１２０多部《格萨尔》。他演唱生动流畅。
    《格萨尔》是流传在藏族、蒙古族中的民间传说，格萨尔王在藏族蒙古族聚居区是家喻户晓的英雄人物，世界许多国家都有专门研究。《格萨尔》已成为国际性的研究课题。
    近年来，我国对《格萨尔》的整理、研究工作取得了一些成绩，成立了不少研究机构。１９８７年青海省还举办了首届《格萨尔》史诗民间艺人演唱会，发现了包括才让旺堆在内的不少艺人。这次研讨会肯定了以往的成绩，提出不少问题，是对青海《格萨尔》研究所工作的一个总结。
