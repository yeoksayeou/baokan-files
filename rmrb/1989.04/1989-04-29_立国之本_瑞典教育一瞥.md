Education is the foundation of the state.

Sweden, though a small country with only 8.4 million people, has seen its model become a hot topic of discussion in various countries. The United States and the Soviet Union have both sent high-level economists to study Sweden. The World Economic Forum in Geneva considers Sweden to be ahead of the United States, Japan, and West Germany in terms of the quality of its managers. What is the reason behind this small country's significant global influence? The emphasis on education and the effort to improve national quality play a crucial role. As early as the early 20th century, Sweden's education budget accounted for 10-12% of the national budget. Over the past century, the emphasis on education has finally borne fruit today.

As a visiting scholar, I once conducted research at the renowned Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden, and I have a deep impression of the country's educational situation. This university has approximately 2,200 faculty members, including 123 professors, and 7,500 students. It has 10 departments, 74 majors, and other research units. The annual research and teaching budget reaches 7 billion kronor (approximately 400 million yuan). Strong economic support has made the Royal Institute of Technology one of the world's renowned centers for teaching and research. The most distinctive feature of the school's management is the university council system, which is the highest authority in the school. It consists of the president, state representatives, labor market representatives, teacher representatives, and student representatives. This management method allows the school to face society and cultivate the talents that society needs.

The core of education is to cultivate and develop a person's independence and creativity. Sweden's living standards are among the highest in the world, but young people do not want to simply enjoy the fruits of others' labor. Whether in society, family, or individually, independence and self-reliance are considered precious qualities. University students' living expenses are mainly self-supported rather than relying on their parents. Students can apply for scholarships and study loans during their studies. Study loans are repaid gradually after graduation. This system not only makes students economically independent but also encourages them to study diligently.

Another feature of the school is the close connection between students and society. After graduating from high school, students usually serve in the military or participate in social service for a year before entering university. In the forest, I often encounter many young soldiers undergoing rigorous outdoor training. This does not cause their studies to be neglected. I know a young friend, Fredrik, who, after completing his military service, used his free time before entering university to volunteer in the school laboratory. I found that this high school student had excellent qualities; he could converse fluently in English and skillfully use a computer.

Another feature is the student union organization. The law stipulates that every student must be a member of the student union. The student union of the Royal Institute of Technology is managed by 6 students, from participating in the school council's leadership work to managing the student cafeteria, like a small society.

In Sweden, learning is not just for the young. Adults also have the right to study, and even those in their late years can pursue a degree.

Treating education as the foundation of the state and making the greatest effort to improve the quality of the nation is the basic point of Sweden's success.

　　立国之本     
    瑞典教育一瞥
    李亨
    教育是立国之本。
    瑞典虽然只是一个８４０万人口的小国，但近年来瑞典模式已成为各国谈论的一个热门话题，美苏相继派出高级经济学家到瑞典考察。日内瓦的世界经济论坛认为，在经理人员的素质方面，瑞典位于美国、日本和西德之前。是什么原因使这样一个小国在世界上有如此巨大影响呢？重视教育事业，努力提高国民素质起着非常重要的作用。早在２０世纪初，瑞典的教育经费已占国家预算的１０—１２％，近百年来对教育的重视今天终于结出了硕果。
    笔者作为访问学者曾在著名的高等学府瑞典皇家工学院从事研究工作，对于这个国家的教育状况有很深的印象。这所大学的教职员工约２２００人，其中教授１２３人，学生７５００人，共有１０个系７４个专业以及其它研究单位。每年的教研经费达７亿克朗（约４亿多元人民币）。强大的经济支持使得皇家工学院成为世界著名的教学和科研中心之一。学校管理的最大特点是大学理事会制度，它是学校的最高权力机构，由校长，国家代表，劳动市场代表，教师代表和学生代表组成。这样的管理方式，使得学校面向社会，能培养出社会所需要的人才。
    教育的中心是培养和发挥人的独立性和创造性。瑞典的生活水平位于世界前列，但是青年人并不愿坐享其成。无论社会、家庭和个人都把独立自主看作是一个人的宝贵品质。大学生的生活费用主要是靠自立而不是靠父母。学生学习期间可申请助学金和学习贷款。学习贷款毕业后逐年偿还。这种制度不仅使学生在经济上自立，而且也促使学生认真学习。
    学校的另一特点是在学青年与社会紧密相联。高中毕业后的学生一般要参军或参加社会义务服务一年后才上大学。在森林里我经常可以遇到许多稚气未脱的青年士兵在进行艰苦的野外训练。这样做并没有使学业荒废。我认识一位青年朋友弗里德里克，他在服完兵役后利用上大学前的空闲时间到学校实验室义务服务。我发现这个中学生素质很好，不仅可以熟练地用英语会话，而且可以熟练使用计算机。
    另一个特点是学生会组织。法律规定每个学生必须是学生会会员。皇家工学院的学生会由６位学生负责，从参加学校理事会的领导工作到学生食堂的管理，如同一个小社会。
    在瑞典，学习并不是年轻人所专有的。成人同样享有学习的权力，甚至古稀之年也可攻读学位。
    把教育视为立国之本，尽最大努力提高国民的素质，这是瑞典成功之路的基本点。
