Shamir agrees to elections in occupied territories

	Xinhua News Agency Amman, April 1

	According to Israeli newspapers, Israeli Prime Minister Shamir recently expressed his acceptance of the proposal for elections and limited self-rule for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

	He said that under certain conditions, he would not rule out elections. However, he added that the nature of the elections should be discussed with the American side.

	An official from the Israeli Foreign Ministry said that Shamir's agreement to elections means that the two major parties in Israel—the Likud Bloc and the Labor Party—have reached a consensus on how to find Palestinian negotiating partners. However, the two parties still have differences in their negotiating positions. Labor Party leader and Finance Minister Peres advocates for land for peace. However, Shamir stated last week that there is no such compromise plan in his visit to the United States.

	Additionally, the largest peace movement in Israel conducted a public opinion poll on March 31, which showed that two-thirds of Israelis support negotiations with the PLO, provided that the PLO stops "terrorist activities" and acknowledges Israel's right to secure its borders.

　　沙米尔同意在被占领土选举
    新华社安曼４月１日电  据以色列报纸报道，以色列总理沙米尔最近表示接受在约旦河西岸和加沙地带的巴勒斯坦人举行选举和实行有限自治的建议。
    他说，在某种条件下，他不排除选举。但他又说，选举的性质应同美国方面商讨。
    以色列外交部一位人士说，沙米尔同意选举意味着以色列两大党——利库德集团和工党的主要领导人在如何找到巴勒斯坦谈判对手的问题上，已达成了一致意见。但两党在谈判立场上仍有分歧。工党领袖、财政部长佩雷斯主张以土地换取和平。然而沙米尔上周表示，他访问美国的计划中没有这样的妥协方案。
    另外，以色列最大的和平运动３月３１日进行的民意测验表明，２／３的以色列人赞成同巴解组织进行谈判，条件是，巴解组织停止“恐怖主义活动”并承认以色列确保边界的权利。
