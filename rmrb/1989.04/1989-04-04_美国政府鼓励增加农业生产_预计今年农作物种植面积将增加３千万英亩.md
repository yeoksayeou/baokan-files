The U.S. government is encouraging increased agricultural production. It is estimated that the area of crops to be planted this year will increase by 30 million acres.

The results of a survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture indicate that, driven by rising market prices, U.S. farmers plan to significantly expand the planting area for crops such as corn, soybeans, and wheat this year.

The Department of Agriculture released a report based on this survey. According to the figures provided in the report, U.S. farmers plan to plant 73.3 million acres of corn this year, an 8% increase over the drought-stricken 1988; 61.7 million acres of soybeans, a 5% increase over last year; 74.3 million acres of wheat, a 13% increase; and 11.8 million acres of sorghum, a 14% increase.

The survey also shows that the area of rice planted in the U.S. this year is expected to decrease by 2%, dropping to 13.2 million acres; the area of cotton planted is expected to decrease even more significantly, by 12%, dropping to 11 million acres.

In 1988, the U.S. experienced the most severe drought in half a century, leading to a 26% decrease in grain production and a significant reduction in grain reserves, causing prices to soar. To encourage farmers to increase production, the U.S. government announced a reduction in the requirement for land to be left fallow this year. It is estimated that the area of crops planted in the U.S. will therefore increase by approximately 30 million acres.

　　美国政府鼓励增加农业生产
    预计今年农作物种植面积将增加３千万英亩
    新华社华盛顿４月２日电  美国农业部所作的一项调查的结果表明，在市场价格上涨的刺激下，美国的农业经营者计划在今年大力扩大玉米、大豆和小麦等农作物的种植面积。
    农业部根据这项调查于日前发表了一份报告。据报告提供的数字，美国农业经营者计划在今年播种玉米７３３０万英亩，比大旱的１９８８年增加８％；大豆６１７０万英亩，比去年增加５％；小麦７４３０万英亩，增加１３％，高梁１１８０万英亩，增加１４％。
    农业部的调查还显示，美国今年的稻谷种植面积预计将减少２％，降至１３２０万英亩；棉花的种植面积下降幅度更大，达１２％，降为１１００万英亩。
    １９８８年，美国发生了半个世纪以来最严重的旱灾，谷物产量锐减２６％，从而导致谷物库存大幅度下降，价格猛升。为鼓励农业经营者增加生产，美国政府宣布降低今年对土地休耕面积的要求。预计美国的农作物种植面积将因此增加约３０００万英亩。
