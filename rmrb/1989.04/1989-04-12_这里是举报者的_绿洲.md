	Here is the Oasis for Whistleblowers

	Browsing through newspapers and magazines, I often see that some people are retaliated against for reporting issues involving their unit's leaders. However, Dongtai City Procuratorate is an "oasis" for whistleblowers. Since the establishment of the reporting agency, the procuratorate has handled 275 letters of complaint, and not a single whistleblower has been retaliated against. This is because there are a few more "walls" here.

	The first "wall" is that the leaders of the Dongtai City Procuratorate insist on strict discipline within the procuratorate and serious case handling procedures. They have explicitly stipulated that "the names of whistleblowers and the content of their reports must be strictly confidential," thus building a mental barrier for the procuratorate's staff.

	The second "wall" is that the Dongtai City Procuratorate strictly implements the registration and handling procedures for letters of complaint. They assign responsible and conscientious staff to handle the receipt and registration of complaint letters and record complaint calls, thereby preventing the leakage of information due to the loss of complaint letters.

	The third "wall" is the careful handling of communication with whistleblowers. The Dongtai City Procuratorate stipulates that communication with whistleblowers should generally be done through correspondence, avoiding the use of telephones as much as possible. When using correspondence, they use ordinary envelopes instead of the procuratorate's official envelopes. When meeting with whistleblowers, they choose locations outside the procuratorate and the unit where the incident occurred, ensuring that whistleblowers feel safe and can speak freely.

	The fourth "wall" is the strict control over the transfer of letters. Some complaint letters report issues that are not within the jurisdiction of the procuratorate and need to be transferred to the relevant authorities for handling. For any complaint letters involving leaders, the Dongtai City Procuratorate transfers only copies of the letters, not the originals. Additionally, they follow up on the handling of transferred cases to ensure that the rights of whistleblowers are not infringed upon.

	The Dongtai City Procuratorate's practice of protecting the confidentiality of whistleblowers is commendable and worth emulating.

　　这里是举报者的“绿洲”
    翻阅报刊，我经常看到，有些人因检举本单位领导人的问题而受打击报复。然而，东台市检察院却是举报者的“绿洲”。市检察院开设举报机构以来，受理举报信件275件，举报者无一人遭打击报复。原来，这里多了几堵挡风的“墙”。
    “墙”之一，市检察院领导人坚持从严治检，严肃办案纪律，明确规定“对举报人姓名和举报内容严格保密”，这使检察院的干部从思想上筑起一道墙。
    “墙”之二，市检察院严格举报信件的登记、收发制度，让责任心强的同志负责收发举报信件，记录举报电话，从而杜绝了因举报信件的散失而造成的泄密。
    “墙”之三，讲究与举报人的联系方式。市检察院规定，与举报人联系，一般采用书信往来，尽量少用电话；采用书信方式联系时，使用一般信封，忌用检察院专用信封；与举报人面谈时，则选择在检察院和发案单位之外的场所，使举报者既有安全感又能畅所欲言。
    “墙”之四，把好信件转处关。有的举报信反映的内容因不属检察机关管辖范围，须转有关主管部门处理，凡涉及到有关领导人的举报信件，市检察院一律转摘抄件，而不转原件。此外，他们还跟踪了解转处件的处理情况，查询有无侵害举报人权益的现象。
    东台市检察院为举报者保密的做法值得称赞，值得效仿。
