A severe drought is threatening winter crops in northern China, making spring farming activities extremely difficult. Relevant departments are calling on local authorities to take measures to strengthen drought relief and crop protection efforts.

The Flood Control and Drought Relief Office of the Ministry of Water Resources today announced that the northern regions affected by drought include the provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, the municipalities of Beijing and Tianjin, the provinces of Hebei and Shandong, the autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang, covering a total of 148 million mu (approximately 9.87 million hectares). Among these, Hebei, Liaoning, Jilin, and Inner Mongolia have 115 million mu (approximately 7.67 million hectares) of affected land.

The drought has already caused significant damage to crops in the northern regions. Hebei, a major grain-producing province, has 44 million mu (approximately 2.93 million hectares) of affected land, including 6.85 million mu (approximately 457,000 hectares) of wheat fields. Some areas have seen widespread crop failure. Liaoning Province has 23.65 million mu (approximately 1.57 million hectares) of affected land, with the majority being water-saving fields, accounting for over 40% of the total cultivated land. In Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, 31.23 million mu (approximately 2.08 million hectares) of farmland and 5.97 million head of livestock are currently facing water shortages.

Water experts and relevant departments have analyzed that the recent drought in northern China is mainly due to below-average precipitation and higher-than-usual temperatures during the winter and spring, leading to severe soil moisture loss. Currently, most northern regions have low water reserves in their reservoirs, and temperatures remain higher than in previous years. If there is no significant rainfall in April and May, the tasks of drought relief, crop protection, and spring farming will become even more challenging.

The Ministry of Water Resources hopes that relevant departments at all levels will take immediate action to assist farmers in combating drought, protecting crops, and ensuring successful spring planting.

　　干旱威胁北方农业生产
　　水利部呼吁各地采取措施抗旱保苗
    新华社北京４月１６日电　（实习生胡顺许、记者王满）一场旱情正对我国北方越冬作物形成新的威胁，使农民春耕活动面临重重困难。有关部门呼吁各地采取措施，加强抗旱保苗工作。
    水利部防汛抗旱办公室今天公布的北方受旱地区有：辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、北京、天津、河北、内蒙古、山东、青海、新疆１０个省、市、自治区，受旱面积１．４８亿亩，其中河北、辽宁、吉林、内蒙古四省、自治区受旱面积达１．１５亿亩。
    旱情已给北方地区农作物造成损害。产粮大省河北受旱面积达４４００万亩，其中麦田６８５万亩；有些地方出现成片死苗。辽宁省受旱面积２３６５万亩，绝大部分是水旱田，占总耕地面积的４０％多。内蒙古自治区目前不仅有３１２３万亩农田受旱，还有５９７万头牲畜处于缺水状态。
    有关水利专家和水利部门的分析表明，近期我国北方旱情的出现，主要是去冬今春降水总量偏少、气温偏高，导致土壤严重失墒。目前，北方大多数地区水库存水较少，气温仍比往年同期偏高，如果四、五月间没有较大降雨，抗旱保苗和春耕生产任务更加艰巨。
    水利部负责人希望各地有关部门尽快采取措施，帮助农民群众打好抗旱保苗抗旱播种这一仗。
