	Representatives Zhou Yaguang and Ma Damou from Shaanxi said:
	Neglecting Ideological Work Will Harm the Entire Nation
	In recent years, phenomena such as drug abuse, prostitution, and gambling have become increasingly prevalent, and the number of major criminal cases has risen. If these issues are not given due attention, they will pose a significant threat to the rectification and overall well-being of the nation. These problems must be addressed seriously; we cannot merely say, "We are not afraid of letting a few flies in when we open the window." Currently, there is a saying in society: "Offending old comrades means losing support, offending superiors means having small shoes, offending colleagues means losing helpers, and offending subordinates means losing votes." Therefore, many people are reluctant to engage in ideological and political work and are afraid to criticize for fear of offending others.

	Representative Chen Guanglin from Anhui said:
	Ministries and Commissions Should Lead in Upholding Central Authority
	The Huadong color TV glass project was included in the national color TV "Eighth Five-Year Plan" technical renovation and introduction project. After relevant experts conducted a comprehensive evaluation of five preselected sites, Wuhu City scored the highest. The planning meeting of the Shanghai Economic Zone preliminarily agreed with the expert group's decision to locate the project in Wuhu. The Ministry of Electronics also agreed to locate the project in Wuhu and formally reported it to the State Planning Commission. However, the person in charge of the Industrial Comprehensive Bureau of the State Planning Commission disregarded the principles of scientific and democratic decision-making, did not respect the expert group's opinion, and arbitrarily agreed to another city to start construction, attempting to create a fait accompli and change the decision to locate the project in Wuhu. This has resulted in the project not being officially approved to this day. It is essential to uphold the seriousness of national plans and the government, and to uphold the authority of the Central Government and the State Council. The ministries and commissions should take the lead in doing so.

	Representatives Tan Quanhai, Chen Shuheng, and Zhang Xiuwu from Jiangsu said:
	"Official Speculation" Must Be Investigated Thoroughly
	"Official speculation" refers to the use of power for commercial gain. For example, last year, an individual from a certain company sold 200 tons of steel to Hengshan Township in Yixing City, demanding a commission (without a receipt) of 100 yuan per ton, totaling 20,000 yuan. Isn't this a clear case of "official speculation"? Additionally, there are significant obstacles in the cleanup of companies. Some investigations cannot proceed, and when problems are found, they claim there are regulations and "notes" (protection). There is a saying in society: "Small speculators wear handcuffs, medium speculators make apologies, and big speculators give reports." Although this saying may not be entirely accurate, it does reflect certain issues. It is suggested that "official speculation," especially by those in positions of power, should be strictly dealt with.

	Representative Fu Kuicheng from the People's Liberation Army said:
	Overcome Impatience and Prevent Hesitation
	Leaders at all levels should pay attention to studying and handling several relationships: First, they should overcome the tendency to be impatient for quick results while avoiding the passive state of hesitation. They should not be overly cautious and hesitant due to the need to correct economic overheating, failing to compress what needs to be compressed and delaying decisions on what needs to be done. Second, they should prevent "one-size-fits-all" approaches and the phenomenon of everyone doing their own thing. Third, they should mobilize the entire nation to work hard while emphasizing the scientific nature of leadership decisions.

	Representative Wen Mingxuan from Guizhou said:
	Social Order Must Be Strengthened
	Last year, there were five weak links in social order: First, the strength of rural public security is weak; second, the education and management of minors are weak; third, the mediation and communication of internal disputes are weak; fourth, social prevention work is weak; fifth, ideological and political work is weak. It is hoped that the State Council and governments at all levels will focus on spiritual civilization construction and social order, and strive to achieve tangible results, just as they do for material civilization construction.

	Representative Bai Tongze from Shanghai said:
	High-ranking Officials and Their Children Should Be Held to Strict Standards
	In the absence of a complete new order for the commodity economy, the children of high-ranking central leaders should avoid commercial activities. It is too lenient to treat high-ranking officials and their children like ordinary citizens. They should avoid commercial activities, which may require them to sacrifice some personal interests. For the sake of rectification and enhancing national cohesion, such requirements should be proposed at present.

	Representative Cheng Kejie from Guangxi said:
	Investment in Grain-Deficit Regions Should Be Increased
	Guangxi has a relatively weak agricultural foundation and a significant grain deficit, requiring the import of tens of billions of jin of grain annually, making it the region with the highest grain imports in the country. To solve this problem, agricultural investment must be increased. If investment is directed towards regions with significant grain deficits, enabling local production increases, it will benefit the country, the region, and the people.

	Representative Lang Baoxiang from Hebei said:
	Enterprises Should Improve Efficiency to Alleviate National Burdens
	Enterprises should strive to improve efficiency and alleviate national burdens. First, deepen reforms to solve problems arising from reforms; second, seek efficiency through management; third, use enterprise spirit to motivate employees to work hard and overcome difficulties together.

	Representative Zhang Cong from Guangdong said:
	The Issue of Newspaper Circulation Fees Should Be Resolved Appropriately
	The General Office of the State Council pointed out at the end of 1988 that the unreasonable occupation of newspaper subscription fees by the postal department and the appropriate reduction of excessively high newspaper circulation fees should be resolved. More than three months have passed, but the problem remains unresolved. If this situation continues, some newspapers will not be able to publish normally.

	Our country's newspapers operate on a subscription system. Currently, the prepaid newspaper subscription fees are entirely occupied by the postal department for an extended period, and then paid to the newspaper offices monthly or delayed to the second month. This is highly unreasonable. We demand that the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the Press and Publication Administration promptly reduce the excessively high circulation fees for some newspapers.

### 全国人大七届二次会议小组发言摘编

　　全国人大七届二次会议小组发言摘编
    陕西代表周雅光、马大谋说：
    忽视思想工作会危害整个民族
    这几年吸毒、卖淫、赌博等丑恶现象越来越多，重大刑事案件数量上升。如果不引起重视，对治理整顿工作和整个民族都有重大危害。对这些问题要认真解决，不能老是说“不怕打开窗子进几个苍蝇”。现在社会上流传着“得罪老同志支持少，得罪上级鞋子小，得罪同事帮手少，得罪下面选票少”。所以许多人不愿做思想政治工作，不敢开展批评，怕得罪人。
    安徽代表陈光琳说：
    各部委要带头维护中央权威
    华东彩电玻壳项目列入国家彩电“八五”技改引进项目，经有关专家对五个预选点进行综合评估，芜湖市得分第一。上海经济区规划会议原则同意专家组定点芜湖的意见，电子工业部也同意定点芜湖，并正式报国家计委。但国家计委工业综合二司负责人不顾决策科学化、民主化的原则，不尊重专家组的意见，擅自同意别的市开工，企图造成既成事实，改变定点芜湖的意见，使这个项目至今未能正式批复。维护国家计划和政府的严肃性，维护中央、国务院的权威，各部委要带头做起。
    江苏代表谭泉海、陈邃衡、张绪武说：
    对“官倒”要查个水落石出
    “官倒”就是以权经商。如去年，某公司的一个人到宜兴市横山乡推销了２００吨钢材，每吨要好处费（没有发票）１００元，一下子就拿了２万元。这不是明显的“官倒”吗？还有，清理公司遇到阻力很大，有的查不下去，查出了问题，他们说有文件规定，是有“条子”的。现在社会上有一种说法，叫做“小倒戴手铐，中倒做检讨，大倒作报告”。这种说法虽然不一定十分准确，但也说明了一定的问题。建议对“官倒”特别是对那些手握重权的“官倒”，要从严处理。
    解放军代表傅奎清说：
    克服急于求成　防止犹豫徘徊
    各级党政领导应重视研究和处理好几个关系：一是既要克服急于求成的倾向，又要防止犹豫徘徊的被动状态。不能因为现在要纠正经济过热，就瞻前顾后，缩手缩脚，该压缩的不敢压缩，该办的事情也迟迟下不了决心。二是既要防止“一刀切”和一哄而起，又要反对各行其是的现象。三是既要动员全民艰苦奋斗，又要强调领导决策的科学性。
    贵州代表文明铣说：
    要大力抓社会治安
    去年社会治安工作存在五个薄弱环节：一是农村治安力量薄弱；二是对青少年的教育、管理工作薄弱；三是内部纠纷的调解疏通工作薄弱；四是社会防范工作薄弱；五是思想政治工作薄弱。希望国务院和各级政府抓精神文明建设和社会治安工作，要像抓物质文明建设那样，下大力抓扎实。
    上海代表白同朔说：
    对高干及其子女要严格要求
    在商品经济新秩序还没有完善时，中央高级领导的子女要对经商问题回避。对高级干部及其子女按一般公民来要求太低了，如他们回避经商要牺牲一些个人利益。为了治理整顿，提高民族凝聚力，目前应该提出这样的要求。
    广西代表成克杰说：
    要增加对缺粮省区的投资
    广西农业基础比较薄弱，粮食缺口较大，每年要调进粮食几十亿斤，是全国调入粮最多的省区。要解决这个问题，必须要增加对农业的投入。如果投到缺粮较大的省区，使其能就地增产，于国于省于民三者均有利。
    河北代表郎宝祥说：
    企业要提高效益为国分忧
    企业要千方百计提高效益，为国分忧。一是进一步深化改革，用改革解决改革中的困难；二是向管理要效益；三是用企业精神带动职工努力拚搏，同心同德共渡难关。
    广东代表张琮说：
    应妥善解决报纸发行费率问题
    国务院办公厅于１９８８年底指出，要妥善解决邮政部门不合理占用报纸预订费和适当降低过高的报纸发行费率问题。三个多月过去了，但问题仍未解决。如让这种情况继续发展下去，一些报纸将无法正常出版。
    我国报纸实行预订制度，现在预收的报纸订费全部归邮局长期占用，然后按月或拖到第二个月付给报社。这是十分不合理的。我们要求邮电部、新闻出版署，尽快将部分报纸过高的发行费率降下来。
