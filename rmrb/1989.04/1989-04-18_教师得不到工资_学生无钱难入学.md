Teachers Unable to Receive Salaries, Students Struggle to Afford School Fees

This year, our village cannot afford to pay the salaries of several of our contracted teachers, which has put us in a difficult situation. The school has no choice but to ask the students for more money. As a result, each student's tuition fee has risen to sixty-one yuan and two jiao.

Our village is located in a mountainous area, and life has never been prosperous. Thirty percent of the students' families cannot afford the fees, so their children have to drop out of school. We went to the village committee to discuss this, but the response was: "Those who can afford it can study, those who cannot afford it should not study." To this day, our salaries are still unresolved. If we continue to ask the students who are already enrolled for more money, half of them will have to drop out as well.

　　教师得不到工资　学生无钱难入学
    今年我村拿不出我们几个民办教师的工资，这可苦了我们。学校只好向在校学生伸手。这样，每个学生的学费达六十一元二角。
    我们村地处山区，生活历来不太富裕，全村有百分之三十的学生家长拿不出钱，只好让孩子辍学。我们找到村委会商量，回答是：“谁出得起钱就读，谁拿不出钱就不要读了。”至今，我们的工资仍无着落。如果再向已入校的孩子伸手，这群孩子又将走掉一半。
