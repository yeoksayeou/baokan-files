Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 20th.

In the face of tightened credit conditions, various levels of the Agricultural Bank of China have adopted a policy of "having both support and control" to strive for more opportunities for agricultural production. According to relevant personnel from the Agricultural Bank of China headquarters, by the end of March, the country had issued 897 million yuan in grain purchase advance payments, an increase of 72 million yuan compared to the same period last year. Among these, the five major grain-producing provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Henan, and Zhejiang issued a total of 472 million yuan in advance payments.

The reporter also learned that this year, local agricultural banks have changed their previous practice of gradually allocating funds and have included advance payments in grain purchase contracts as one of the main contents of the "three-linkages" (contract grain purchases linked with fertilizers, diesel, and advance payments). They combine advance payments with actual goods to give farmers more choices. If farmers need advance payment loans, local agricultural banks can issue them directly; if farmers need agricultural production materials, the bank can convert the advance payment loans for contracted grain into agricultural material loans, and the local agricultural materials department can supply the needed fertilizers, pesticides, or agricultural films. This approach effectively supports increased agricultural investment and has been well-received by farmers across the country.

　　农行为农业生产开“绿灯”    
    首季发放粮食定购金近九亿
    新华社北京４月２０日电（实习生胡顺许、记者王满）在银根抽紧的情况下，我国各级农业银行纷纷采取“有保有压”的政策，力争多给农业生产“开口子”。据中国农业银行总行有关人士透露，截至３月末，全国已发放粮食定购资金贷款８．９７亿元，比去年同期增加７２００万元。其中辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、河南和浙江５个粮食主产省共发放定金４．７２亿元。
    记者还了解到，今年各地农业银行在发放粮食定金过程中，改变以往逐级下放资金指标的做法，将定金纳入粮食定购合同之中，作为“三挂钩”（合同定购粮食与化肥、柴油、预购定金挂钩）的主要内容之一，把定金和实物相结合，争取给农民更多的选择余地。如果农民需要定金贷款，地方农业银行可以直接发放；如果农民需要农业生产资料，农行可以将其应得的合同粮食定金贷款转为农资贷款，由当地农资部门供给所需化肥、农药或农膜。这样做的结果，有效地支持了增加农业投入，受到各地农民欢迎。
