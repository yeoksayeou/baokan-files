I am a disabled worker. To make it easier to commute to work, I bought a three-wheeled motorcycle for the disabled in October last year. However, after using it for a few days, the vehicle became unusable due to quality issues.

On January 29, I had my brother go to the manufacturing factory, Tianjin Guangming Hardware Factory Baodi Branch, to seek help. The factory director was very warm and, after listening to my brother's account, expressed a commitment to taking full responsibility for the customer. The next day, the factory sent two technicians with my brother to Beijing. They repaired the motorcycle on the same day, solving my transportation difficulties.

The sense of responsibility that Tianjin Guangming Hardware Factory Baodi Branch showed towards its customers deeply moved me.

　　对残疾人负责的厂家
    我是个有残疾的工人，为了上下班方便，去年１０月买了一辆残疾人用的三轮摩托车。可没用几天，这辆车因质量问题不能用了。
    １月２９日，我让哥哥到生产厂家天津光明五金厂宝坻分厂寻求帮助。厂长很热情，他听完我哥反映的情况后，表示要对用户负责到底。第二天，厂里就派了２名技术工人随我哥来到北京，当天就将车修好，解决了我的行路难问题。
　　天津光明五金厂宝坻分厂对用户负责的精神使我非常感动。
