The United States announced today that Secretary of State James Baker will visit Moscow from May 10 to 11. He will hold talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze on human rights, arms control, regional issues, and bilateral relations.

State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Baker will also meet with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Baker's visit to the Soviet Union comes just days before Gorbachev's trip to China for a summit meeting with Chinese leaders.

This will be Baker's first visit to the Soviet Union since he took office as Secretary of State in Bush's administration in January.
