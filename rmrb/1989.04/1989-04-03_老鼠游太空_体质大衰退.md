In February of this year, Soviet and American scientists jointly announced the detailed results of twenty-eight research experiments at the aerospace research center in California, USA.

In the field of biology, the mice carried by the Soviet "Cosmos" spacecraft in October 1987 experienced a significant reduction in bone strength after flying for twelve days. Their humerus became 40% more brittle, and the support strength of their spinal vertebrae decreased by 27%. Additionally, fluid accumulated between their muscle cells, the mitochondria in their heart muscles degenerated, muscles around their bones atrophied, the ratio of red to white blood cells in their blood became imbalanced, affecting their immune function. The cholesterol and triglyceride levels in their bodies increased, sperm production decreased, and growth hormones dropped by 60%.

The results of biological experiments on space satellites indicate that humans must engage in regular physical exercise and supplement hormones if they are to live in a weightless environment for extended periods.

Scientists have declared that similar space biological experiments will continue. The "Discovery" space shuttle launched by the United States on March 13 carried four small white mice for experimentation. After being anesthetized, small holes were drilled into the bones of the mice's hind legs. Upon the completion of the flight, researchers will be able to study the healing of injured bones in a weightless environment, thereby further investigating how astronauts can manage bone fractures caused by calcium loss during long-duration space flights (such as missions to Mars).

### 老鼠游太空　体质大衰退

　　老鼠游太空　体质大衰退
    今年二月，苏联和美国科学家在美国加利福尼亚航天研究中心共同宣布了二十八项科研实验详细结果。
    在生物学方面，苏联“宇宙”号太空船一九八七年十月携带的老鼠在飞行十二天后，骨骼力量普遍下降了五分之二，肱骨的脆度增加了百分之四十，脊椎骨的支撑力减弱了百分之二十七。同时，它们的肌肉细胞间产生积液，心脏肌肉的线粒体退化，骨骼周围肌肉萎缩，血液中红白血球比例失调而影响到免疫能力，体内胆固醇和甘油三酸酯含量增高，精子增殖率减少，生长性荷尔蒙降低百分之六十。
    太空卫星上的生物实验结果表明，人类长时间生活在太空失重环境中，必须经常进行体育锻炼和补充荷尔蒙激素。
    科学家们宣称，类似的太空生物实验将继续进行。美国三月十三日发射的“发现号”航天飞机就携带了四只供实验用的小白鼠。经过麻醉后的小白鼠，后腿骨上被钻了小孔。待飞行结束后，就能够研究在失重情况下伤骨的愈合情况，从而可进一步研究宇航员在长时间太空飞行（如飞向火星）时，如何处理因骨骼丧失钙质而造成的骨折。
