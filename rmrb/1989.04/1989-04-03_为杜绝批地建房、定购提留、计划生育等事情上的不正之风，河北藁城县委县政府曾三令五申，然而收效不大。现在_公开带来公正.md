To eradicate the malpractices in land allocation, mandatory procurement, and family planning, the CPC and government of Gaocheng County in Hebei Province have repeatedly issued directives. However, the results have been unsatisfactory. Now—

Transparency Brings Fairness

Reporter: Song Shiqing

In Gaocheng County, Hebei Province, matters directly related to the interests of the people are mostly handled transparently.

In the past, who could have a second child was decided by village cadres, with much arbitrariness and deception. Now, applicants' information is posted on the wall, along with a photo of the mother and child. It is clear at a glance who has a child with disabilities and who does not.

Previously, the location of individual business stalls was decided by commercial management personnel, with "auspicious" spots always occupied by a few individuals, while those without connections were placed in remote areas. Now, different stalls have different pricing standards, and stalls with the same standard are allocated by drawing lots, ensuring equal opportunities and periodic adjustments.

Transparency brings fairness. Some problems in Gaocheng County's rural areas that were previously difficult to solve have become relatively simple and easy to resolve.

The "Difficulty" Leads to Reflection

Since the second phase of rural reform in Gaocheng County, the difficulty of grassroots work has increased. Family planning is difficult, land allocation is difficult, mandatory procurement is difficult, enterprise and orchard contracting is difficult, and recruitment is also difficult.

At the end of 1987, Jiamu Village faced a "peach garden storm" due to the low base number for orchard contracting, leading to a significant income gap between contracting and non-contracting households. Thousands of villagers petitioned in the county seat, causing unrest among both cadres and the masses. In such matters directly involving the people, various contradictions have become increasingly sharp.

Is it that the people are uncooperative, or that the cadres lack ability? The Gaocheng County Party Committee did not draw a simple conclusion but carefully analyzed the new situations and problems brought about by the rural social economy.

For many years, the various levels of Party committees and governments in Gaocheng County have faced 240 brigades and more than 1,000 production teams that practiced the "iron rice bowl" and egalitarianism. Everyone was poor, and contradictions were not prominent. After implementing the household contract responsibility system, part of rural economic activities entered the commodity economy track. The various levels of Party committees and governments now face 150,000 households. These 150,000 basic production and accounting units engage in various different economic activities, and various interests and distributions are closely related, making things much more complex.

For example, grain procurement. The state procurement price is too low, and the supply of agricultural production materials at the planned price is insufficient, causing farmers to complain bitterly. Under these circumstances, some government officials abuse their power for personal gain, favor relatives and friends, engage in corruption, extortion, and illegal trading. Farmers do not get what they should, leading to their dissatisfaction.

Public officials abuse their power, and the "seven departments and eight bureaus" indulge in eating, drinking, and taking bribes. Village cadres act arbitrarily, and the people are even more discontent. They want to voice their opinions but do not know whom to approach. Moreover, with "the mountains are high and the emperor is far away," the "small power holders" to some extent represent the government in exercising power. Can one afford to offend them? Farmers are frustrated and resentful, and the reasons are not just one. But what they are most dissatisfied with is that cadres are not clean, and their work is not fair. This is the key and an important cause of the sharp contradictions in rural areas.

To handle matters fairly, they must be transparent. Ordinary people understand this logic: "Hiding things usually means no good." Most illegal and disorderly activities are "underground operations."

Based on this understanding, in May 1988, the Gaocheng County Party Committee and government formulated the "two transparencies and one supervision" system, with the main content being "transparency in procedures, transparency in results, and strengthening public supervision." They started with the issues that the people care about the most but are the least reassured about, and genuinely solved the problem of clean governance.

Transparency Is Not the Goal

Transparency is not just a formality. The "two transparencies and one supervision" system in Gaocheng County has a clear guiding ideology: to let the people understand all the procedures they should know, and to let the people clearly see all the results that can be made public, so that the people can supervise.

There are many matters related to the people's interests, involving various policies, regulations, and systems. Various departments have simplified complex policies and regulations into practical systems. The Agricultural Bank of the county simplified the tens of thousands of words of agricultural loan policies and regulations from various levels of government into less than a thousand words of procedures that the people can understand, remember, and use.

Transparency in handling results is divided into two types: regular work, such as tax collection from individual businesses, bank loans, and family planning, is published once a month or once a quarter; temporary work, such as housing allocation, recruitment, land allocation, and enterprise and orchard contracting, is published as soon as it is handled.

The county committee also decided that January 10 to 20 and June 10 to 20 of each year would be the "transparency period." In mid-January this year, from the county committee and government to various departments, towns, and villages, everyone, in every industry, publicly disclosed the work situation over the past half year or year and various items that the people are sensitive about and care about.

Transparency in procedures and results has lifted the veil of mystery from administrative activities, and the people know the details. Even those with power in their hands may have the intention of seeking personal gain but will not be without "concerns."

The Gaocheng County Party Committee and government also took various measures to facilitate public supervision. The county supervision bureau established a reporting center, and each town and department set up reporting mailboxes. There are more than 500 reporting mailboxes just for family planning. The taxation, agricultural bank, commerce, public security, and 11 other departments established supervision organizations and institutions, with 123 units setting up full-time supervision cadres. Various levels of government departments also generally implemented the system of receiving visits on designated days and set up political and disciplinary supervision officers.

With the supervision channels open, the people have a way to report, and it is not so easy for anyone to seek power and personal gain. Recently, in Meng Village, Gaocheng Town, 17 households applied for land, and the village approved 7. The county's relevant departments had also approved them. The villagers discussed: without even a discussion, what kind of transparency is this? Once the list was posted, it turned out that all 7 households were related to the cadres but did not meet the conditions. The villagers reported to the town, and the village cadres had to admit their mistake and start over.

Seeing Hope and Light

Although Gaocheng County has implemented the "two transparencies and one supervision" for less than a year, the effect is obvious. County Party Secretary Zhang Erchen summarized it into three points. First, to a certain extent, it solves the problems of fairness and justice, easing rural contradictions between cadres and the masses; second, it helps to standardize and legalize government behavior, which is beneficial to changing the habit of not following the law and not acting according to policies, beneficial to making current policies more perfect, constraining the behavior of cadres, and improving the quality of cadres; third, it enhances the democratic awareness of cadres and the masses, finding a practical path for rural grassroots democratic construction.

The county committee and government's relevant departments provided many convincing figures and examples to illustrate the changes brought about by transparency. However, what left a deeper impression on the reporter and made the feelings more specific was the conversation with 8 ordinary farmers. Among them, some farm, some repair clocks, some run businesses, and some engage in transportation.

— "Transparency is in line with our psychology. You ask what psychology? No one cheats. In the past, when recruiting workers, the village cadres would just 'squeeze' and secretly send them away, how could one not be angry? This time, recruiting workers, broadcasting conditions, and open examinations, the whole village had 97 people applying. My child said that more than a dozen people were caught cheating and were immediately disqualified. Finally, the papers were taken to Shijiazhuang to be graded by teachers, and six men and two women were selected based on the male-female ratio and scores. You ask about my child? He didn't pass this time, but we are convinced, and there will be more opportunities in the future."

— "In our village, when distributing land, the party secretary said three times: anyone who seeks favor from the cadres will be disqualified. Originally, with transparency, the cadres' personal words do not count, 'hand grenades' cannot blow it open, and 'dynamite packs' are also useless, so why bother?"

— "In the past, there was a lot of interception here and there, and quite a bit of bullying. Walking in the village, look: wearing this hat and that hat, drunk, staggering out of someone's home supported by others. Now, it's not that there are none, but there are far fewer. You say this is not rescuing cadres?"

In the construction of clean governance, some are concerned that the people's expectations are too high and do not know how to proceed. From Gaocheng County, it can be seen that the people's demands are not high, nor are they harsh, just the two words "fairness." Once it is transparent, it will bring fairness, which is not difficult. Achieving this, the people will see the hope and light of clean governance construction, thus enhancing their "participation awareness" and "crisis awareness."

At the end of February this year, Gaocheng County held the People's Congress and Political Consultative Conference, and County Party Secretary Zhang Erchen gave a report on the situation. The people of Gaocheng have not had the habit of applauding leaders' speeches for many years. But when he spoke about implementing the "two transparencies and one supervision" and rural grassroots democratic construction, the venue broke the precedent with two rounds of enthusiastic applause. Of course, this is just a start. In terms of "transparency" and "fairness," there is still a lot of work to be done.

　　为杜绝批地建房、定购提留、计划生育等事情上的不正之风，河北藁城县委县政府曾三令五申，然而收效不大。现在——
    公开带来公正
    本报记者  宋世琦
    在河北省藁城县，与群众切身利益直接相关的事，大多是公开的。
    过去，谁能生“二胎”，村干部说了算，随意性大，弄虚作假的多。如今，申请者情况张榜上墙，还要贴上一张母子合影，谁家的娃有残疾，谁家的娃没毛病，一目了然。
    以前，个体工商户摊位设哪儿，工商管理人员说了算，“风水宝地”总是那几个人占着，无门路的被安排在冷僻处。现在，公开了不同摊位的不同收费标准，同一标准的摊位抓阄定地段，机会均等，定期调整。
    公开带来公正。藁城县农村一些过去难以解决的问题，变得比较简单，容易解决了。
    “难”字引出的思索
    藁城县农村第二步改革实行以来，基层工作难度越来越大。计划生育难，宅基地批复难，定购提留难，企业、果园承包难，招工招干也难。
    １９８７年底，贾市庄镇因过去果园承包基数低，承包与非承包家庭收入悬殊，农民迫切要求重新承包。一场“梨园风波”，导致上千群众进县城上访，搅得干部群众都不安生。在诸如此类直接与群众打交道的事情上，各种矛盾日益尖锐。
    是群众不听话，还是干部没本事？藁城县委没有简单地下结论，而是用心分析农村社会经济带来的新情况、新问题。
    多年来，藁城县各级党委和政府，面对的２４０个大队，１０００多个生产队，是吃大锅饭、搞平均主义的集体，你穷我也穷，矛盾不突出。实行联产承包责任制后，农村经济活动部分纳入商品经济轨道，各级党委和政府面对的是１５万个家庭。这１５万个基本经营和核算单位，从事各不相同的经济活动，种种利益与分配密切相关，事情变得复杂多了。
    例如粮食定购。国家定购价格偏低，平价农用生产资料供应数额不足，使农民叫苦不迭。在这种情况下，少数政府工作人员利用职权谋取私利、优亲厚友、贪污受贿、敲诈勒索、倒买倒卖，农民该得的得不到，引起了农民的不满。
    公职人员以权代法，“七所八所”吃喝拿要，乡村干部随心所欲，群众更为反感。想提意见吧，不知该找谁。况且，“山高皇帝远”，“小实权派”在一定程度上代表政府行使职权，得罪得起吗？农民窝火，憋气，原因不只一个。但他们最不满的，是干部不廉洁，办事不公正。这是关键，是农村诸多矛盾尖锐的重要起因。
    办事要公正，必须公开。老百姓都懂这个理：“藏着掖着没好事”。违法乱纪大多是“地下活动”。
    基于这种认识，１９８８年５月，藁城县委、县政府制定了以“办事制度公开，办事结果公开，加强群众监督”为主要内容的“两公开一监督”制度，从群众最关心而又最不放心的问题入手，切实解决廉政问题。
    公开不是目的
    公开，不是走形式。藁城县“两公开一监督”制度，有明确的指导思想：让群众了解一切应该了解的办事制度，让群众清楚所有能够公开的办事结果，以便群众监督。
    有关群众利益的事五花八门，涉及各种政策、法规、制度。各部门经过努力，使复杂的政策、规定简化为易行的制度。县农业银行将各级政府的三四万字的农贷政策规定，简化为不到千字的办事制度，群众看得懂，记得住，用得上。
    公开办事结果，分两种情况：经常性工作，如向个体户收税、银行贷款、计划生育等，一月或一季公布一次；临时性工作，如住房分配、招工招干、宅基地发放、企业和果园承包等，随时办理随时公布。
    县委还决定，每年１月和６月的１０日至２０日为“公开旬”。今年１月中旬，从县委、县政府到各部门、乡村，上上下下，各行各业，公开了半年或一年来的工作情况和群众敏感关心的各种事项。
    办事制度、办事结果公开，揭去了政务活动的神秘面纱，群众知道了事情的底细。手上有权的人即使有谋私之心，也不免有“后顾之忧”。
    藁城县委、县政府还采取了多种方便群众监督的措施。县监察局设立了举报中心，各乡镇、部门设举报信箱，仅计划生育举报箱就有５００多个。税务、农行、商业、公安等１１个部门设立了监察组织和机构，有１２３个单位设立了专职监察干部。各级政府部门还普遍实行来访接待日制度，设立政风政纪监督员。
    监督渠道畅通，群众举报有门，谁再想弄权谋私，就不那么容易了。藁城镇孟村不久前发放宅基地，全村１７户申请，村里定了７户，县有关部门也已批准。群众议论纷纷：连讨论都没讨论，这叫什么公开？张榜一公布，原来７户都与干部沾亲带故，而又都不符合条件。群众告到镇里，村干部只好认错，推倒重来。
    看到希望和光明
    藁城县实行“两公开一监督”虽然不到一年，效果却是明显的。县委书记张二辰概括为三条。一是在一定程度上解决了公平、公正问题，缓解了农村干群矛盾；二是有助于政府行为规范化、法制化，有利于改变有法不依、不按政策办事的积习，有利于使现行政策趋于完善，约束干部行为，提高干部素质；三是增强了干部群众的民主意识，为农村基层民主建设找到一条实实在在的路。
    县委、县政府有关部门提供了不少令人信服的数字和实例，说明实行公开带来的变化。而使记者印象更为深刻，感受更为具体的，是同８位普通农民的谈话，他们之中有人种地，有人修钟表，有人办企业，有人搞运输。
    ——“公开符合我们的心理。你问什么心理？没人作弊呗。过去招工，村干部底下一‘捏’，悄悄送走了，能没气？这回招工，又是广播条件，又是公开考试，全村报名９７人。我孩子回来说，抓出十几个找人替考作弊的，当场除名，最后卷子拿到石家庄请老师打分，按男女比例、得分高低顺序录用六男二女。你问我的孩子？他这次没考上，但我们服气，以后还有机会。”
    ——“我们村发放宅基地，支部书记连说三遍：谁到干部家求情，取消资格。本来么，讲公开，干部个人说了不算，‘手榴弹’炸不开，‘炸药包’也不灵了，还费那个事干啥？”
    ——“过去这也截留，那也截留，这‘霸’那‘霸’不少。走在村里，看吧：戴这个帽那个帽的，喝得醉熏熏，从农户里歪歪扭扭让人架出来。现在，不能说一个没有，但少多了。你说这算不算挽救干部？”
    廉政建设，有人担心群众期望值过高，不知如何下手。从藁城县看，群众要求并不高，更不苛刻，不过“公正”二字而已。公开了，就会带来公正，说难也不难。做到这一点，群众会从中看到廉政建设的希望和光明，从而提高“参与意识”和“忧患意识”。
    今年２月底，藁城县召开人大、政协会议，县委书记张二辰作了形势报告。藁城人已经多年没有给领导干部讲话鼓掌的习惯了。但他讲到实行“两公开一监督”，讲到基层民主建设时，会场上破例两次响起热烈掌声。当然，这仅仅是个起步。在“公开”和“公正”这两点上，需要做的工作还很多。
