The Yalta Conference

From February 4 to 11, 1945, the heads of state of the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom—Rosevelt, Stalin, and Churchill—met in Yalta, Crimea, for their second conference. The conference adopted resolutions on the complete defeat of Germany, the elimination of German militarism and fascism, the punishment of war criminals, and the democratization of post-war Germany. The resolutions stipulated that after the war, all German military facilities must be thoroughly dismantled, and the Nazi Party must be completely liquidated and disbanded. After Germany's surrender, the country would be occupied by the military forces of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union in separate zones, with a control commission composed of representatives from the Allied Supreme Command established in Berlin. It was agreed that major war criminals would be handed over to the International Military Tribunal for trial. In principle, it was agreed that the Allies would provide only the minimum living resources to the German people and would not be responsible for anything else.

Regarding the issue of German reparations, the conference did not reach an agreement and decided to establish a special committee to further discuss the matter. The conference also discussed the reorganization of the Polish government, the determination of Poland's borders, the establishment of a new government in Yugoslavia, the meeting of the three foreign ministers, and the repatriation of prisoners of war.

During the conference, Roosevelt and Stalin held a private meeting to discuss the issue of the war against Japan in the Far East and reached a secret agreement. The agreement stipulated that the Soviet Union would participate in the war against Japan two to three months after Germany's surrender. The conditions for this were as follows: ① The status quo of Outer Mongolia (Mongolian People's Republic) must be maintained. ② The southern part of Sakhalin Island and all nearby islands must be returned to the Soviet Union; the port of Dalian must be internationalized, and the Soviet Union's superior rights in the port must be guaranteed. The Soviet Union's lease of Port Arthur as a naval base must also be restored; a Sino-Soviet joint venture company should be established to jointly operate the Chinese Eastern Railway and the South Manchurian Railway. It was understood that the Soviet Union's superior rights must be guaranteed, while China must maintain full sovereignty over Manchuria. ③ The Kuril Islands must be handed over to the Soviet Union. The agreement stipulated that regarding the issues of Mongolia, Dalian and Port Arthur, and the Chinese Eastern Railway, the U.S. President would take steps, as proposed by the Soviet Union, to obtain China's agreement.
