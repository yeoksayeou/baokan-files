The second batch of agricultural commodity base construction plans for the state's "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period has been implemented. According to the principle of prioritizing grain production, during this period, the state and local governments will invest 560 million yuan to build 80 commercial grain base counties and 33 high-quality agricultural product bases in 24 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions.

This is what the reporter learned from the national agricultural commodity base meeting held by the Ministry of Agriculture in Kunming recently. This batch of commercial grain bases is mainly arranged in the northwestern dryland agricultural areas, southern rice-producing areas, and most grain-importing provinces and regions. The state and local governments will jointly invest 380 million yuan. These funds will be mainly used for agricultural infrastructure construction and the promotion and application of technology to improve production conditions, form new production capacity, and increase yield per unit area. It is required that the total grain production of the counties undertaking the project increases by 5% to 10%, and the increase in commercial grain is 5%.

　　国家和地方投资５．６亿  再建百余农业商品基地
    本报昆明４月５日电  记者肖俊熙报道：国家“七五”期间第二批农业商品基地建设计划已经落实。按照以发展粮食生产为主的原则，这期间，国家和地方将投资５．６亿元，在２４个省、市、自治区建设８０个商品粮基地县和３３个优质农产品基地。
    这是记者从农业部近日在昆明召开的全国农业商品基地会上获悉的。这批商品粮基地重点安排在西北旱作农业区、南方水稻产区和大部分粮食调入省、区，仍采取国家与地方联合投资的形式，共投资３．８亿元。这些资金重点用于农业基础设施建设，科技推广应用等，以改善生产条件，形成新的生产能力，提高单产。要求承担项目县的粮食总产量增长幅度达到５％-１０％，提供商品粮增长５％。
