As the highest authority of the state, how has the National People's Congress performed in implementing legal and work supervision over the past year? This is one of the "hot" topics discussed by the representatives. Li Zhen, the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Shandong Provincial People's Congress, candidly admits: "It is not very effective." He attributes the reason to the fact that the leadership emphasizes support too much and supervision too little. There is a saying, "Support is supervision"; another saying is, "Supervision is inherent in support." This is undoubtedly correct, but he believes that supervision is both a constraint and a form of support, and it should be emphasized. Implementing supervision over laws and government work is a power granted by the people to the People's Congress, and it should be done without hesitation or ambiguity. Some comrades emphasize that the People's Congress should not overstep its authority. Is it more about dereliction of duty or overstepping authority? Li Zhen believes that there is more dereliction of duty and less overstepping of authority. The powers granted by the Constitution to the People's Congress have not all been used, and some have not been used enough. This shows that the People's Congress has great potential and room for improvement in implementing legal and work supervision.

New laws should be enacted, and existing laws that are not perfect should be amended. Many representatives hold this view. Zhai Yongmo, Deputy Secretary of the Jinan Municipal Committee and Mayor, says that the People's Congress has enacted more than 130 laws and administrative regulations, some of which are not perfect and too general. For example, the Forest Law, even legal experts think it has too much flexibility and is difficult to enforce. He believes that it is necessary to focus on enacting new laws, but existing laws should also be improved and amended seriously. Li Qingmin, Vice Chairman of the Jinan Municipal Political Consultative Conference and Senior Engineer, also agrees. He says that laws should be rigorous and flawless. Some of the laws that have been promulgated have many gaps and are flexible, making it easy for there to be laws that are not enforced and for the phenomenon of "power over law" to occur. For example, tax laws are a prominent issue at present. In the market, tax officials may not have high positions, but they have a lot of power. He says that whoever they tell to pay how much must pay, and if vegetable sellers give them some vegetables, they don't have to pay taxes. State-owned enterprises evade taxes by 50%. Official companies, tax officials cannot even enter the door. In this regard, the Standing Committee of the People's Congress should formulate supervision measures. To ensure supervision, is it necessary to have a supervision law?

The representatives strongly advocate that the People's Congress should effectively carry out legal supervision. Jin Zhi, Deputy Secretary of the Party Branch of Xiaojin Village, Huaiyin District, Jinan City, appeals: "The state has enacted many laws, but how are they implemented? Is it truly governed by law? The People's Congress should seriously investigate." He has seen with his own eyes: many illegal acts become "legal" with money.

Henan representative and Vice Chairman of the Legal Committee of the National People's Congress, Gu Ming, believes that weak enforcement is a problem, but the lack of laws to rely on is an even bigger problem. He says that in the past, the tradition was to emphasize policies and neglect laws. In recent years, legislative work has not kept up with the pace of reform. To adapt to the needs of deepening reform, he suggests accelerating legislation and quickly enacting laws such as the Construction Investment Law, Budget Law, Banking Law, Financial Law, Credit Law, and Securities Issuance Management Law.

Legislation is indeed important, but if the timing is not right, do not rush to enact it. During the discussion of the Enterprise Law, Shandong representative and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Ni Zhifu, holds this view. He believes that laws come from practice and must be practical; if they are not practical, the law does not bind the people. He uses the Enterprise Law as an example. Recently, he investigated dozens of factories, and none of them fully implemented it. Workers demanded that the factory director implement it, but the factory director had difficulties. Ni Zhifu believes that laws should be enacted actively, but conditions should also be created, and one should be enacted when it is mature, and it should be implemented once it is promulgated.

Zhi Zuowen, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Jilin Municipal People's Congress, suggests that the Administrative Litigation Law should not be rushed to enact, but first draft an interim regulation for trial implementation, and then repeatedly amend and gradually improve it. Once a law is enacted and passed by the People's Congress, it cannot be changed overnight. He believes that the draft of the Administrative Litigation Law currently under discussion is unclear in terms of the scope of acceptance and judicial basis. If implemented, it will conflict with many current policies and be difficult to enforce.

Once the Administrative Litigation Law is enacted, the supporting implementation regulations must follow quickly. Wang Shuyu, a worker from Kaifeng United Harvesting Machine Factory, says that there is a process of changing the mindset when "citizens sue officials," and there is also a question of whether one dares or is able to "wear small shoes," which requires some work. If the Administrative Litigation Law is enacted, there should be implementation regulations to ensure that it can be well enforced.

　　完善法律　加强监督
    ——山东、吉林、河南代表谈“热点”问题
    本报记者  张何平
    作为国家最高权力机构，一年来全国人大在实施法律监督和工作监督方面做得怎样？这是代表们谈论的“热点”之一。山东省人大常委会主任李振不讳言：很不得力。究其原因，他认为，在这方面，领导上过多强调支持，而少强调监督。有一种说法，“支持就是监督”；还有一种说法，“监督寓于支持之中”。这无疑是对的，但他认为，监督既是一种制约，也是一种支持，应该加以强调。对法律和政府工作实施监督，是人民赋予人大的权力，应毫不含糊、理直气壮。有的同志强调人大不要越权。究竟是失职多，还是越权多？李振认为，失职不少，越权不多。宪法赋予人大的权力，有的还没使用，有的用得还不够。这说明人大在实施法律监督和工作监督方面，后劲不小，潜力很大。
    新法该出台，旧法不完善也应修改。不少代表都有这个看法。济南市委副书记、市长翟永浡说，人大制订了１３０多个法律和行政法规，有的不完善，太原则。如森林法，连法律专家都认为伸缩性太大，无法可依。他认为，注重制定新法很必要，但对已出台的法也要完善，认真加以修改。济南市政协副主席、高级工程师李清岷亦有同感，他说，法律应严谨，无懈可击。已颁布的法，有的空隙很多，有弹性，易造成有法不依，也易出现“权大于法”的现象。比如税法，当前问题突出。集市上税务员官不大，权不小，他说让谁纳多少就得纳多少，卖菜的送点菜，税就不纳了。国营企业偷漏税５０％。官办公司，税务员进不去门。对此，人大常委会要制定监督办法。为保证监督，是否有必要搞个监督法？
    人大应有效地进行法律监督，是这些代表的强烈呼声。来自济南市槐荫区段店镇小金庄的党支部副书记金志忠呼吁：国家法立了不少，但执行的情况怎样？是否真正依法办事？人大应认真调查。他耳闻目睹：许多违法事，花了钱就“合法”，就一通百通。
    河南代表、全国人大法律委员会副主任委员顾明认为，执法不力是个问题，但无法可依更成问题。他说，过去传统是重政策，轻法律。近年来，立法工作不能跟上改革的进程。为了适应深化改革的需要，他建议要加快立法，尽快制订出基建投资法、预算法、银行法、金融法、信贷法、股票发行管理等法律。
    立法固然重要，但时机不成熟，不要忙于出台。山东代表、全国人大常委会副委员长倪志福在讨论企业法时，就持这种看法。他认为，法是从实际中来的，要行得通；行不通，法不责众。他以企业法为例。最近，他调查了几十家工厂，没有一个完完全全地执行。职工们要求厂长执行，厂长有难处。倪志福认为，法要积极地立，但也要创造条件，成熟一个订一个，颁布了就要执行。
    吉林市人大常委会主任智作文建议，行政诉讼法不要忙于出台，先搞个暂行条例，试行一段，然后反复修改，逐步完善。立了法，人大通过了，就不能朝令夕改。他认为，正在讨论的行政诉讼法草案受案范围、审判依据等不明确，如实施，同目前的不少政策有冲突，执行起来很困难。
    行政诉讼法一旦出台，配套实施细则要快跟上。开封联合收割机厂工人王书玉说，民告“官”有个思想转变过程，也有个敢不敢、会不会“穿小鞋”的问题，需要做些工作。行政诉讼法如出台，要有实施细则，以保证能很好执行。
