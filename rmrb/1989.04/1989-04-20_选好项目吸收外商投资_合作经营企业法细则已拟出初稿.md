　　选好项目吸收外商投资    
    合作经营企业法细则已拟出初稿
    本报北京４月２０日讯  记者计泓赓、冯霄报道：今明两年吸收外商投资工作如何？经贸部副部长沈觉人今天在这里举行的全国外商投资工作会议上说，这要结合治理、整顿，严格把握投资方向，坚持优选项目，积极、稳妥地进行。
    沈觉人提出，要尽可能选择那些条件好的老企业来吸收外商投资，嫁接先进的技术和管理经验；继续鼓励外商来华办独资企业。新上的项目必须是发展国民经济急需的，或者是“两头在外”或使用国内丰富原材料的产品出口项目；采用先进技术和管理经验对现有轻纺、机电等行业进行技术改造，能提高产品档次或开发新产品的项目；高科技项目和基础设施基础原材料项目，如能源、交通、钢铁、化工、建材等行业。
    沈觉人说，中国欢迎国际上知名度大的跨国公司、国际采购集团和商业集团来华投资。他要求对外商投资项目的审批程序制度化、公开化。
    他透露，中国人民银行和国家计委已决定，拿出４亿元人民币的贷款指标，帮助部分重点外商投资企业解决配套资金问题。中外合作经营企业法实施细则已拟出初稿，正在征求意见。
