The "?" symbol appears on the currency of many countries, and its origin can be traced back to the early 16th century. At that time, Spain minted a type of silver coin known as the "PESO" (Peso), which featured a crown and royal emblem on one side and two pillars on the other. Therefore, this silver coin was also called the "Double Pillar Coin." According to mythology, Europe and Africa were connected in the Strait of Gibraltar, which was later separated by the Greek mythological hero Hercules. The two pillars on the coin represent the steep cliffs on both sides of the Strait of Gibraltar. In 1732, Mexico minted a new type of double-pillar silver coin, adding the images of the Eastern and Western Hemispheres between the pillars and wrapping a ribbon around each pillar, forming a "$$" shape. This silver coin gradually made its way into North America, where it was called the "Dollar" by the Americans. They used the two pillars and ribbons from the coin's design as a symbol and adopted the "?" as a shorthand notation for the dollar. The "?" symbol thus spread to various parts of the world.

　　“?”的由来
    许多国家的货币上都印有“?”符号，它的由来可追溯到１６世纪初。当时的西班牙铸造了一种名为“ＰＥＳＯ”（比索）的银元，它的图案一面是皇冠和王徽，一面是两根柱子，因此这种银币又称“双柱币”。据神话传说，欧洲和非洲大陆在直布罗陀地区彼此相连，后来被希腊神话中的大力士赫格里斯拉开，银币上的两根柱子，代表直布罗陀海峡两岸陡峭的山岩。１７３２年，墨西哥铸造出一种新式双柱银元，在两柱之间加上了东西两半球的图案，并在两根柱子上各缠绕了一条卷轴，形成＄＄形。这种银元渐渐流入北美，当时美国便把这种钱币称为Ｄｏｌｌａｒ，并以图案中的两根柱子和彩带为标志，把“?”作为美元的简写符号。“?”从此传至世界各地。　　　　　　　　　　（寿川）
