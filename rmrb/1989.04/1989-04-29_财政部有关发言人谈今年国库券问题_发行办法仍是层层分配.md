A spokesperson from the Ministry of Finance recently discussed this year's treasury bond issuance and the upcoming redemption of treasury bonds issued from 1981 to 1984.

Q: What measures will be taken for the issuance of treasury bonds this year?

A: The issuance of national bonds in our country has always been conducted using a combination of political mobilization and economic measures. This year will be no different. According to the treasury bond regulations, the 5.5 billion yuan in treasury bonds to be issued to urban and rural residents this year will continue to be allocated through a tiered distribution system.

Of course, we will also do a good job in publicity, mobilization, and organizational work to ensure that the tasks are allocated fairly and reasonably.

Q: What is the current situation of the treasury bond transfer market?

A: With the approval of the State Council, our country conducted two phases of pilot programs last year to open the treasury bond transfer market, allowing the 1985 and 1986 issued treasury bonds to be traded on the market. Currently, 61 cities nationwide have carried out this work. After a year of piloting, the treasury bond transfer market has initially taken shape.

However, due to the impact of inflation, the treasury bond transfer pilot work has encountered some difficulties. Under the current circumstances, the timing for fully opening the treasury bond market and expanding the scope of treasury bond transfers is not yet ripe. This year, we will mainly focus on supervising and managing the existing treasury bond circulation market, especially strengthening the management of treasury bond transaction prices. At the same time, we are also preparing to select cities with better conditions among the 61 pilot cities to conduct a pilot program for the transfer of 1982 to 1984 treasury bonds. After gaining experience from the pilot program, we will gradually promote it.

　　财政部有关发言人谈今年国库券问题    
    发行办法仍是层层分配
    据新华社北京４月２９日电  记者日前就今年国库券发行及即将到期的１９８１年至１９８４年国库券的兑付等问题采访了财政部国家债务管理司负责人。
    问：今年在国库券发行方面将采取哪些办法？
    答：我国国债发行工作，历年来都是采取政治动员和经济手段相结合的办法。今年也是这样，根据国库券条例，今年对城乡居民发行的５５亿元国库券仍将采取层层分配任务的办法。
    当然我们将做好宣传动员和组织工作，努力使任务分配得公平合理。
    问：目前国库券转让市场情况怎样？
    答：经国务院批准，我国去年先后分两批进行了开放国库券转让市场的试点，允许１９８５年和１９８６年发行的国库券上市买卖。目前全国已有６１个城市开展了这项工作。经过一年的试点，国库券转让市场已初步形成规模。
    但是，由于受通货膨胀的影响，国库券转让试点工作遇到了一定的困难。在目前的情况下全面开放国库券市场和扩大国库券转让范围的时机还不成熟。今年我们仍主要是对现有国库券流通市场进行监督管理，特别是要加强对国库券交易价格的管理。同时我们也准备在已试点的６１个城市中，选择条件较好的城市进行开放１９８２年至１９８４年国库券转让业务的试点，待试点取得经验后，再逐步推广。
