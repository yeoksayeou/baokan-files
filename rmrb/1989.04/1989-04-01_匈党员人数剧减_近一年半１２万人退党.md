Hungarian Party Membership Dramatically Decreases
120,000 Leave Party in Past Year and a Half

NEW YORK, March 30 (Xinhua) — János Lukács, a member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, said today at a press conference that the number of members in the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party is rapidly decreasing.

He said that the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party currently has 780,000 members. In the past year and a half, 120,000 people have left the party, while only 20,000 have joined. The trend of decreasing membership continues.

Lukács believes that the decrease in party membership is related to the "social crisis in Hungary," the "position and role of the party," and the "political line of the party."

    新华社布达佩斯３月３０日电  匈牙利社会主义工人党政治局委员、中央书记卢卡奇·亚诺什今天在记者招待会上说，匈牙利社会主义工人党党员人数正在大量减少。
    他说，匈牙利社会主义工人党现有党员人数为７８万。在最近一年半的时间内共有１２万人退党，２万人入党。党员人数减少的趋势仍在继续。
    卢卡奇认为，党员人数减少与“匈牙利社会危机”、“党的地位与作用”和“党的政治路线”有关。
