The late Chinese painter, traditional Chinese painting theorist, and educator Liu Lingcang is renowned for his exquisite fine brushwork and heavy color portraits.

He was born in Gu'an, Hebei. At the age of 14, he apprenticed under the folk artist Li Dongyuan, mastering basic techniques of form and color application. In 1926, introduced by his teacher Yang Guanru, he joined the Chinese Painting Research Society to study under the famous fine brushwork and heavy color portrait painters Xu Yansun, Guan Pinghu, and Yu Ming. In 1928, he furthered his studies at the National Art Academy in Beijing. He authored works such as "Tang Dynasty Portrait Painting," "Song Dynasty Portrait Painting," "Selected Ancient Chinese Portrait Paintings," and "Technique of Fine Brushwork and Heavy Color in Chinese Painting." He excelled in historical narratives and portraits of women, creating masterpieces such as "Zhao Wenjun Listening to the Qin" (see right image), "Princess Wencheng," "Li Bai's 'Qingping Melody,'" and "Qu Yuan's Wandering." His brushwork is vigorous and robust, his style is profound and steady, and he skillfully combines fine brushwork with heavy color. He adeptly uses lines of varying lengths and thicknesses to accurately depict the texture of clothing.

　　刘凌沧的美术创作
    已故中国画家、国画理论家、教育家刘凌沧先生，以其精湛的工笔重彩人物画而闻名于世。
    他是河北固安人，１４岁拜民间画工李东园为师，掌握了一定造型手段和设色技法。１９２６年，由师杨冠如介绍入中国画研究会学习，继承了工笔重彩人物画著名画家徐燕孙、管平湖、俞明的传统技法。１９２８年，又进北京国立艺术专科学校深造。有《唐代人物画》、《宋代人物画》、《中国古代人物画选集》、《中国画的工笔重彩技法》等论著。他善长历史故事和仕女画，创作的《卓文君听琴图》（见右图）、《文成公主》、《李白清平调诗意》、《屈子行吟图》等许多力作，笔墨苍劲刚健，画风浑厚沉着，工意兼善，用线长短粗细都能恰当地表现出衣饰的质感。                        沈希诚
