Gorbachev Arrives in Cuba
Bush Urges Gorbachev to Promote Peace in Central America

BEIJING, April 2 — Reporter Guo Weicheng reports: The General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Mikhail Gorbachev, arrived in Havana this afternoon, beginning a three-day official visit to Cuba. This is the first visit by a Soviet leader to Cuba since the 1960s.

Gorbachev was warmly welcomed by Fidel Castro, Raul Castro, and others at the foot of the airplane stairs. A grand welcoming ceremony was held at the airport.

According to reports from news media in Mexico City, approximately 500,000 people from a population of 2 million in Havana took to the streets to welcome the arrival of the Soviet leader. In recent days, Havana has been decorated anew, with a festive atmosphere, preparing to express fraternal friendship to the "son of the Lenin homeland." About 500 journalists from various countries, including 200 from the United States, have gathered in Havana to fully report on the first visit by the Soviet leader to a Latin American and Caribbean country. Mexican newspapers and television stations reported on the reactions of Havana residents to this visit.

It is expected that the Soviet leader's visit to Cuba will reaffirm the Soviet Union's support for the Cuban revolution. The difference lies in the scale and manner of this support and the impact it will have on Cuba's foreign policy, particularly its policy towards Central America. U.S. President Bush has repeatedly urged in recent days that Gorbachev, during his visit to Cuba, push Cuba to promote democracy and peace in Central America.

It is understood that during his visit over the next two days, Gorbachev will hold a series of talks with Cuban leader Castro, in addition to visiting the Cuban Expo, hospitals, and the Cuban Institute of Biotechnology; delivering a speech to the special session of the National Assembly of People's Power of Cuba; and signing a Soviet-Cuban friendship and cooperation agreement.

This visit was originally scheduled for last December but was postponed due to the Armenian earthquake in the Soviet Union. Accompanying Gorbachev on his visit are his wife Raisa, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, and Politburo member Alexander Yakovlev, among others. Gorbachev and his entourage will leave Havana on the 5th, returning home via the United Kingdom.

　　戈尔巴乔夫抵古巴访问
    布什要求戈氏推动古巴促进中美洲和平
    本报墨西哥城４月２日电  记者郭伟成报道：苏共中央总书记、苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席戈尔巴乔夫今天下午抵达哈瓦那，开始对古巴进行为期３天的正式访问。这是６０年代以来苏联最高领导人第一次访问古巴。
    戈尔巴乔夫在飞机舷梯旁受到菲德尔·卡斯特罗、劳尔·卡斯特罗等的热烈欢迎。在机场举行了隆重的欢迎仪式。
    据墨西哥城新闻媒介报道，拥有２００万人口的哈瓦那，大约有５０万人走上街头，欢迎苏联领导人的来访。连日来，哈瓦那装饰一新，一派节日气氛，准备向“列宁祖国的儿子”表示兄弟般的友好情意。来自世界各国的约５００名记者，其中２００名美国记者，云集哈瓦那，以便充分报道苏联最高领导人对一个拉美和加勒比国家的首次访问。墨西哥报纸与电视台报道了哈瓦那市民对这次访问的反应。
    人们预料，苏联最高领导人对古巴的这次访问，将会重申苏联对古巴革命的支持。不同的是，对古巴革命的支持将采取什么样的规模与方式以及将对古巴的外交政策、尤其是对中美洲政策产生什么样的影响。美国总统布什近日已经多次呼吁，要求戈尔巴乔夫在访古时推动古巴促进中美洲的民主与和平进程。
    据悉，戈尔巴乔夫在明后天的访问中，除了与古巴领导人卡斯特罗进行一系列会谈外，还将参观古巴博览会、医院和古巴生物技术研究所；向古巴全国人民政权代表大会特别会议演讲，并签订苏古友好合作协定。
    这次访问原定去年１２月进行，由于苏联亚美尼亚大地震而推迟。陪同戈尔巴乔夫访问的有戈尔巴乔夫的夫人赖莎、苏联外交部长谢瓦尔德纳泽、苏共中央政治局委员雅科夫列夫等人。戈尔巴乔夫一行将于５日离开哈瓦那，经英国回国。
