Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, April 9th. (Reporter Zhang Wei) The government, business sector, and workers of Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, have united to control prices, resulting in a month-by-month decline in the retail price index for the first three months of this year.

Last year, Taiyuan City's retail price index rose higher than the national average. During the New Year and Spring Festival this year, relevant units organized over 500 commercial enterprises in the city to conduct discount sales. Afterwards, some forward-thinking store managers believed that discount sales could only maintain short-term effects, while controlling prices was a long-term task. At their initiative, the Taiyuan City Price Control Promotion Association was established, primarily composed of the business sector.

The Price Control Promotion Association adopted forms of joint purchasing and joint sales to organize supplies, reducing intermediary costs and ensuring that member stores' retail prices remained at the lowest level in the city. These member stores issued "price credibility cards" to customers, allowing them to receive the price difference if the price of goods purchased from them was higher than elsewhere. Over 600 worker price supervisors organized by the union also actively cooperated with government price management agencies and the business sector, promptly reporting market price information. This formed a price supervision network in Taiyuan City, significantly enhancing the government's ability to manage prices.

According to statistics from the price department, in the past three months, the prices of general commodities in Taiyuan City have decreased by 5% to 10%, and the prices of color TVs, refrigerators, washing machines, and other household appliances have decreased by 30%. The prices of food, vegetables, poultry, and eggs, which are closely related to people's lives, have also decreased.

### 政府商界职工同心协力  太原平抑物价见效  首季零售物价指数逐月下降

　　政府商界职工同心协力
    太原平抑物价见效
    首季零售物价指数逐月下降
    据新华社太原４月９日电  （记者张伟）山西省太原市政府、商界和职工同心协力抑物价，使今年头３个月的零售物价指数出现逐月下降趋势。
    去年，太原市零售物价指数上升幅度高于全国平均水平。今年元旦、春节期间，有关单位组织全市５００余家商业企业开展减价销售活动。事后，一些有见识的商店经理认为减价销售只能维持一时，而平抑物价是一项长期工作。在他们的倡议下，组织了以商界为主的太原市平抑物价促进会。
    平抑物价促进会采取联购联销、分购联销的形式组织货源，以减少环节费用，保证会员商店的商品零售价格始终处于全市最低水平。这些会员商店向顾客发放“物价信誉卡”，顾客从他们那里购买的商品若价格高于其他商店，可以到原购货店领回差价款。由工会组织的６００余名职工物价监督员也积极与政府物价管理机构和商界配合，及时通报市场物价信息。这样一来，太原市形成了物价监督网，使政府管理物价的能力大大增强。
    据物价部门统计，近３个月，太原市一般商品售价下降了５％至１０％，彩电、冰箱、洗衣机等家用电器售价下降了３０％。与人民生活密切相关的副食品、蔬菜、禽蛋的价格也有所下降。
