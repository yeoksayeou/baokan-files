Title: The Foreign Connoisseur

Four or five decades ago, when I was in school, many people, like me, had a sense of national inferiority. We saw how others made cars and airplanes, while we couldn't even make bicycles ourselves and had to buy Japanese ones. Rickshaws were called "foreign carriages," matches were called "foreign fire," and the musical instruments in primary schools were all foreign drums and horns, all made abroad. In sports, Liu Changchun, the fastest runner, couldn't beat the foreigners... Sigh!

Now, of course, this sense of inferiority is gone, all dispelled by facts. Things invented by foreigners, we not only catch up with but surpass. In ping-pong and volleyball, we win three consecutive championships, four consecutive championships... In piano, violin, and singing foreign songs, we compete with foreigners and win championships. There's no talk of foreign martial artists being able to wield the Chinese three-section staff, but in foreign fencing competitions, the first place is taken by a Chinese woman. In mathematics, we have Hua Luogeng and Chen Jingrun; in chemistry, we have Hou Debang, and so on. I once saw a foreign female singer perform, and her singing of foreign songs was truly excellent! But when she sang "Nanliwan," it fell short.

There was just one thing that for a long time I couldn't figure out. I always thought that foreigners couldn't match us in Chinese painting, and Chinese people painting Western oil paintings wouldn't make it abroad. But recently, facts have shattered my old notions. I had heard before that a Chinese oil painter went to Italy, the holy land of oil painting, to study, but encountered someone who wanted to learn from him. But that was just hearsay; seeing is believing. What I saw was my old cartoonist friend Zhou Lushi. He is a teacher at the Central Academy of Drama's Stage Art Department. Although he graduated from university and is an oil painter, he is as honest as a house painter. After teaching for decades, at over sixty years old, he is only an associate professor. One day, an American came, probably having seen his works at an art exhibition, and requested to visit his home to see his paintings. There were many paintings, aside from a portion that had been exhibited, the rest were piled up in the cramped living quarters, stacked like they were in a "cow shed," covered in dust. This guest, after seeing the ones displayed outside, eagerly wanted to see the ones inside, so much so that he forgot his manners and started moving things himself. Later, he told others that at the time he was so captivated that he forgot his manners. He then invited Lushi to take his works to the United States for an exhibition. It turned out that this guest was the director of a museum and a professor of art history.

In April 1988, Zhou Lushi went to the United States. The exhibition opened, and to his surprise, the visitors were stunned. Art critics wrote: "It is astonishing!" They said Zhou "skillfully combines traditional Chinese painting techniques with the techniques of the European Impressionist school of the 19th century." Television stations were busy reporting, and half a page of the *Seattle Times* was taken up by his paintings, 16 centimeters wide. Along with an introductory article, this page was almost entirely occupied by Zhou. Many people who wanted to learn from him were chasing after him, including an American painter who had studied in France. Upon seeing Zhou, he also chased after him, taking him back to his home, and together they went to the American West to sketch and paint, capturing the beauty of snow-capped mountains, forests, and valleys. These paintings attracted many viewers when exhibited. The museum director who invited Zhou proudly said to him, "See how good my eye is?" He also considered himself a connoisseur. Zhou Lushi's achievements made it very easy for him to obtain an extension of his visa to stay in the United States, until February of this year before he returned. If it weren't for his wife's persistent longing, sending him twelve golden invitations to call him back to the country, he would still be in the United States, painting everywhere, preparing to accept official invitations.

　　洋伯乐
　　方成
    四五十年前，我在上学的时候，不少人和我一样，有民族自卑感。看到人家造汽车飞机，我们连自行车都得买日本货，自己不会造。人力车叫“洋车”，火柴叫洋火，小学里的乐器都是些洋鼓洋号，全是外国造；体育运动中跑得最快的刘长春赛不过洋人……唉！
    现在，这种自卑感当然不会有了，都被事实一件件批倒了。外国发明的东西，我们有的不但能赶上，而且超越。乒乓球、排球等等，在世界比赛中赢得三连冠、四连冠……，钢琴、小提琴、唱洋歌，我们和外国人比，照样拿过冠军。没听说外国武术家能耍中国的三截棍，可外国的击剑比赛，拿第一的却有中国人，而且是个女的。数学家我们有华罗庚、陈景润，化学家有侯德榜，等等。我看过一位外国女歌唱家的表演，唱起洋歌，那真没说的，就是棒！可她一唱《南泥湾》，就差多了。
    只一件，很长时间我头脑里还有个疙瘩没解开。我总以为，外国人画中国画比不了我们，中国人画西洋油画，在外国照样吃不开。但最近几天，事实又把我的老观念打倒了。以前曾听说过，一位中国油画家到洋画圣地意大利去深造，却遇到有人向他学习。但那只是听说，耳闻不如眼见。我见到的是我的漫画老友周路石。他是中央戏剧学院舞台美术系教师。别看他是大学出来的，是位油画家，但老实得像油漆匠。教几十年书，六十多岁，评职称只是个副教授。有这么一天，一位美国人，大概在画展中看过他的作品，要求到他家拜访，看他的画。画真不少，除其中一部分曾展出过之外，都堆在狭小的居室中，一摞摞挤得像进了“牛棚”，灰尘满面。这位客人看过摆在外面的，还急着要看挤在里面的，急得忘乎所以，自己动起手来。后来对别人说，当时迷得他把礼貌都忘记了。于是邀请路石把作品拿到美国展览，原来这位客人是一家博物馆的馆长，美术史教授。
    １９８８年４月，周路石到了美国。画展开幕了，大出他意外，参观的人看得愣了神。美术评论家写道：“令人惊奇！”说周“把中国传统绘画笔法和欧洲十九世纪印象派的技法巧妙地结合在一起了。”电视台忙着报道，《西雅图时报》的一个版面被他的画占去大半版，横宽１６厘米。加上一篇介绍文章，这一版几乎全被周占领。许多向他学画的人在追他，其中一位是美国画家，曾到法国进行深造，他一见周，也追上来了，把他专程接回家里，和周一道去美国西部写生作画，画雪山，森林，河谷各处美景。这些画在展出时吸引不少观众。那位邀请周的博物馆馆长颇为自傲地向周说：“瞧我的眼力如何？”他也以伯乐自居了。周路石的成就，使他十分顺利地得到留美延期签证，一直到今年２月才回来，若不是周夫人苦苦思念，发十二道金牌把他召回国，他还在美国到处作画，正准备接受官方邀请呢。
