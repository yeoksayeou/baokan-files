The judicial administrative work for this year will focus on supporting the central task of rectifying the economic environment, improving economic order, and deepening comprehensive reforms. The aim is to fully leverage the functions of the judicial administrative departments to provide effective legal services and strong legal guarantees.

At a recent national conference of heads of judicial bureaus, it was reported that the judicial administrative departments will concentrate their efforts on supporting economic rectification and reform. According to statistics from 1988, the number of legal professionals in China has increased from 27,000 to over 31,000. These professionals have served as legal advisors for over 88,000 government agencies and enterprises. They have handled 265,000 civil cases, 71,000 non-litigation matters, 170,000 criminal defenses, and 8,400 foreign-related legal affairs. There are now over 15,000 notary public officials in the country, and the scope of notary services has expanded from the original 19 items to over 100. In 18 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities), over 300 reform-through-labor units and over 100 re-education-through-labor units have signed rehabilitation agreements with local governments, relevant units, and the families of prisoners and re-education-through-labor detainees, promoting rehabilitation work. The Ministry of Justice believes that these effective measures must be continued to better serve the economic rectification and deepening of reforms.

　　法部门确定工作重点  围绕治理整顿提供服务
    本报讯  记者晓渡从前不久召开的全国司法厅（局）长会议获悉：今年司法行政工作的重点是，紧紧围绕治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革这个中心，充分发挥自己的职能作用，努力提供有效的法律服务和有力的法律保障。
    司法部长蔡诚在会上谈到司法行政机关充分发挥职能作用的问题。据１９８８年的统计，全国律师工作人员已从２．７万多人发展到３．１万多人，为８．８万多个政府机关和企事业单位担任了法律顾问。代理民事案件２６．５万多件，代理非诉讼事务７．１万多件，承担刑事辩护１７万多件，办理涉外法律事务８４００多件。全国已有１．５万多名公证人员，公证业务也由原来的１９个项目增加到１００多个。全国有１８个省（区、市）劳改局、３００多个劳改单位、１００多个劳教单位与当地政府、有关单位，以及犯人、劳教人员家属签订了帮教协议，促进了改造工作。司法部认为，这些有效的工作必须坚持，以更好地为治理整顿和深化改革服务。
