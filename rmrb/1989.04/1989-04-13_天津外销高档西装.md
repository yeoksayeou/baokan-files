Recently, the Tianjin Jinda Garment Limited Company produced 4,000 sets of Jinda-brand high-end men's suits, which were first included in the product lineup of the world-renowned Italian textile and financial conglomerate (GFT) and shipped to Europe, the United States, Japan, Australia, and other countries.

The Italian textile and financial conglomerate specializes in producing and selling high-end products designed by internationally renowned fashion masters such as Ungaro, Valentino, and Pierre Cardin. Its management of the sales of Jinda-brand men's suits indicates that China's men's suit production technology has been recognized as reaching world-class standards.

In the past, high-end suit products were non-existent in Tianjin, let alone being exported.
