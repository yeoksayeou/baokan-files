	Wuhan Mayor Accepts Journalist's Suggestion to Stop Competitive Celebrations for City Anniversary

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, April 17th — (Intern, Miao Fanzu, Reporter Zhang Songqing) Recently, reporters and editors of the Wuhan Evening News jointly wrote a letter to Mayor Zhao Baojiang, suggesting to stop some units from preparing to hold grand celebrations on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of Wuhan's liberation. Mayor Zhao adopted the journalists' suggestion and hoped that public opinion would continue to supervise the city's work.

	This year marks the 40th anniversary of Wuhan's liberation. During interviews with various units, reporters discovered that the city had numerous "factory anniversaries" and "school anniversaries," and there was a trend of one-upmanship. In their letter to the mayor, they wrote: "If everyone competes to hold celebrations, how much money will be wasted in feasts and festivities?"

	Mayor Zhao Baojiang thanked the journalists for their sincere advice and said: Celebrations should be conducted in a solemn, practical, and frugal manner.

	It is understood that the Wuhan Municipal Government has decided that the municipal finance will not allocate special funds, and will not hold large-scale activities like fireworks displays to create a stir. The city's anniversary will mainly feature small-scale, dispersed, and mass activities.

　　武汉市长接受记者建议制止借市庆竞相办庆典
    据新华社武汉４月１７日电　（实习生苗凡卒、记者张松青）《武汉晚报》的记者和编辑们前不久联名给市长赵宝江写信，建议制止一些单位准备借武汉解放４０周年之际大办庆典的做法。赵市长采纳了记者的建议，并希望大众舆论继续监督市里的工作。
    今年５月是武汉市解放４０周年。记者们到一些单位采访时发现，全市“厂庆”、“校庆”名目繁多，而且呈现攀比之势。他们在给市长的信中写道：“如果大家竞相庆典，将会有多少钱财在歌舞升平中耗费殆尽？”
    赵宝江市长感谢记者们的诚恳进言，并说：庆典应本着隆重、务实、节俭的原则进行。
    据悉，目前武汉市政府已作出决定，市财政不拨专款，不搞焰火晚会一类制造声势的大型活动，市庆以小型、分散的群众性活动为主。
