After the spring rain, the sky above Pyongyang is even more blue and clear. This afternoon, Comrade Zhao Ziyang, accompanied by Comrades Li Zhongyu, Xu Xun, and Choi Kwang, visited the Sino-Korean Friendship Haesan Cooperative Farm in Sunan District, Pyongyang.

Zhao Ziyang arrived at a farmhouse that Premier Zhou Enlai had visited. Along the way, a group of kindergarten children on the balcony waved bouquets and shouted, "Hello!" "Come again!" Zhao Ziyang waved back and said loudly, "Hello to you too!" This farmhouse is a traditional-style courtyard with a gabled roof. At the entrance, Zhao Ziyang looked up at the eaves and said, "These houses still retain the national style." Entering the courtyard, Zhao Ziyang stopped in front of the room where Premier Zhou had rested. The farm chairman, Cha Do-Hak, introduced that on February 19, 1958, Chairman Kim Il-sung accompanied Premier Zhou Enlai to visit here and had rested in this room. During that visit, a very moving scene occurred. A 65-year-old woman named Choi Su-Ryeol had lost her family in an enemy air raid and was seriously injured, her life hanging by a thread. Volunteers rushed to her aid, carried her to the hospital for emergency treatment, and eventually saved her life. She grabbed Premier Zhou's hand and said excitedly, "The volunteers are my saviors; they saved my life. I will strive to build my country to repay the volunteers' kindness." Chairman Kim Il-sung praised the old woman, had the interpreter quickly translate for Premier Zhou, and said, "The old woman's words represent and express the feelings of the Korean people towards the Chinese people." Premier Zhou held the old woman's hand and said, "Your words are very good, and I am very grateful to you." He added, "Both countries have mutual gratitude and should thank each other."

Today, both Choi Su-Ryeol and the host of the room where Premier Zhou stayed, Seo Seong-bil, have passed away. However, Seo Seong-bil's son, Ko Young-chan, is still here. He was not able to return in time because he was part of the welcoming team. Zhao Ziyang had to ask Cha Do-Hak to deliver the gift he had prepared for the host. Later, on the outdoor field, Zhao Ziyang happened to meet Ko Young-chan and shook his hand firmly. Ko Young-chan told the reporter, "I will take good care of this house and pass down the Sino-Korean friendship from generation to generation."

During the visit to the agricultural technology popularization room and the mechanized operation class, Zhao Ziyang was very enthusiastic and asked detailed questions about agricultural production. Zhao Ziyang asked, "Do you grow hybrid rice?" Cha Do-Hak replied, "We are promoting it, and the yield is 20% higher than ordinary rice." Zhao Ziyang reached out and touched the neatly arranged rice transplanter and asked, "What percentage of the area is mechanized for transplanting?" Cha Do-Hak replied, "Almost 100%."

The Haesan Cooperative Farm and Beijing Hongxing People's Commune established a friendly relationship on August 11, 1960. They maintain regular contact, visit each other, and learn from each other. Beijing's high-quality cucumbers and eggplants have been introduced here. Many Chinese leaders who visit Korea come here for a tour. Today, Zhao Ziyang specially planted a lush pine tree in the courtyard of the agricultural technology popularization room. Two young members of the Korean Children's Union promised Zhao Ziyang, "We will take good care of this tree and let it be as evergreen as the Sino-Korean friendship." Zhao Ziyang happily said, "Thank you!" Before leaving, Zhao Ziyang wrote eight large characters: "Sino-Korean Friendship, Passed Down from Generation to Generation."

　　赵紫阳访问朝中友谊合作农场
    本报记者  周必忠  徐宝康
    春雨初歇，平壤上空更加碧蓝澄澈。今天下午，赵紫阳同志在李钟玉、许锬、崔光等同志陪同下，到平壤市顺安区朝中友谊宅庵合作农场访问。
    赵紫阳来到周总理访问过的农家。路上，一群幼儿园的孩子在阳台上挥舞着花束，齐声高喊：“您好！”“再来！”赵紫阳向他们挥手致意，大声说：“你们好！”这户农家是一座歇山式屋顶的农家小院。在院门前，赵紫阳抬头看了看带檐的院门，说：“这些房子还是民族形式。”走进院里，赵紫阳在周总理驻跸过的房前停下脚步。农场委员长车斗赫介绍说，１９５８年２月１９日，金日成主席陪周恩来总理到这里访问时，曾在这间屋子里歇息过。在那次访问中，出现过一个十分动人的场面。有一位６５岁的崔史烈老太太，家里人在一次敌机轰炸中被炸死，她也身负重伤，生命垂危。闻讯赶来的志愿军把她背到医院抢救和治疗，最后恢复了健康。她拉着周总理的手激动地说：“志愿军是我的恩人，他们对我有救命之恩。我要努力建设自己的祖国，来报答志愿军的恩情。”金日成主席称赞老太太讲得好，让翻译赶紧翻给周总理听，并说：“老太太的话，代表了也表达了朝鲜人民对中国人民的感情。”周总理拉着老太太的手说，您说的话很好，我非常感谢您。并说，中朝两国互有恩情，都应当感谢。
    今天，崔史烈老太太和接待周总理的这间房子的女主人徐成弼尽管都已经离开人世，但是，徐成弼的儿子高永赞还在。他因为参加欢迎队伍来不及赶回来。赵紫阳只好请车斗赫转交他送给房主人的礼品。后来在外边场地上，赵紫阳正好碰上了高永赞，紧紧地跟他握手。高永赞告诉记者，我要好好看管这座房子，让朝中友谊世世代代相传下去。
    在参观农业科技知识普及室和机械化作业班的过程中，赵紫阳兴致很高，详细询问了农业生产的一些情况。赵紫阳问：“你们种不种杂交水稻？”车斗赫回答：“正在推广，产量比一般水稻高２０％。”赵紫阳伸手摸了摸摆得整整齐齐的插秧机问：“机械插秧的面积占多少成？”车斗赫回答：“几乎是百分之百。”
    宅庵合作农场同北京红星人民公社于１９６０年８月１１日结成友好关系。他们经常联系，互相访问，彼此学习。北京的良种黄瓜和茄子早在这里落户安家。来朝鲜访问的许多中国领导人都要到这里参观。今天，赵紫阳还特地在农业科技知识普及室前院，铲土栽下一棵苍翠的松树。两名朝鲜少年团团员向赵紫阳保证：“我们一定要精心管好这棵树，让它像中朝友谊一样万古长青。”赵紫阳高兴地说：“谢谢！”临别前，赵紫阳挥笔写下八个大字：“中朝友好，世代相传”。
