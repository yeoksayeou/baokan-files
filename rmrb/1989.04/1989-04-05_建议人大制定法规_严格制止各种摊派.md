Currently, various forms of imposition and sponsorship in society are numerous and diverse, with amounts ranging from a few hundred to tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of yuan. This is indeed a significant social problem. It leads to the uncontrolled growth of extra-budgetary investments, increases the economic burden on the units and individuals being imposed upon, raises production costs, and provides opportunities for corruption, bribery, and waste. The departments and units subjected to these impositions generally feel that these numerous impositions and sponsorships have some backing, and even if they have grievances, they dare not voice them, fearing that if they offend these parties, future matters will be even more difficult to handle. They can only endure in silence. It is suggested that the National People's Congress formulate regulations to eliminate this phenomenon.

　　建议人大制定法规  严格制止各种摊派
    目前，社会上的各种摊派、赞助五花八门，无奇不有，金额少则千百元，多则上万、几十万甚至上百万元，实属社会一大公害。它造成了国家计划外投资无限制增长，加重了被摊派单位和个人的经济负担，加大了产品成本，同时也给贪污、腐败、挥霍浪费者以可乘之机。被摊派的部门和单位普遍反映，这些名目繁多的摊派和赞助都有点来头，有意见也不敢提，怕得罪了他们，今后的事情更难办，只能忍气吞声。建议全国人大制定法规，杜绝这种现象。
