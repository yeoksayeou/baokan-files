Chairman Yang Meets Mongolian Foreign Minister

	BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) — Chairman Yang Shangkun met with Mongolian Foreign Minister Tsedenbal Gonchigsuren this afternoon at the Great Hall of the People. Yang said that China has always advocated that relations between countries should be based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. China also consistently respects the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the Mongolian People's Republic. The two countries are completely equal, and their relations should be those of close cooperation.

	At the beginning of the meeting, Chairman Yang warmly welcomed Gonchigsuren as the first Mongolian foreign minister to visit China since the establishment of diplomatic relations 40 years ago. He hoped that this visit would mark the beginning of frequent exchanges between the two countries, like visits among relatives.

	Chairman Yang said that China and Mongolia are neighbors and should maintain friendly relations. There have been some "knots" between the two countries in the past, for various reasons. Now, we do not need to dwell on them. As long as everyone looks to the future, the possibilities for cooperation between China and Mongolia are vast.

	Foreign Minister Gonchigsuren briefed Chairman Yang on his talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen the previous day. He believed that the talks were very successful, and both sides agreed on the need to further develop bilateral relations. This aligns with the wishes and fundamental interests of the peoples of Mongolia and China.

　　杨主席会见蒙古外长
    本报北京３月３１日讯  记者刘水明报道：国家主席杨尚昆今天下午在人民大会堂会见蒙古人民共和国外交部长策伦皮勒·贡布苏伦时说，我们一贯主张国与国之间的关系应该建立在和平共处五项原则的基础上，我们也一贯尊重蒙古人民共和国的独立、主权和领土完整。中蒙两国是完全平等的，两国之间的关系应该是亲密合作的关系。
    会见开始时，杨主席对贡布苏伦作为中蒙建交４０年以来第一位蒙古外长到中国正式访问表示热烈欢迎，并希望他的来访，成为两国间像走亲戚一样常来常往的开端。
    杨主席说，中蒙两国是近邻，应该友好相处。在过去一段时间内，两国之间曾经有过一些“疙瘩”，当然原因很多，现在我们就不必再提它了，只要大家都向前看，中蒙两国之间合作的可能性是很大的。
    贡布苏伦外长向杨主席介绍了昨天他同钱其琛外长的会谈。他认为会谈进行得很顺利，双方在进一步发展两国关系的观点上是一致的。这符合蒙中两国人民的愿望和根本利益。
