Title: Where is the "Ping Pong Kingdom" Headed?

Before 1959, no one referred to China as the "Ping Pong Kingdom." It was after that year, when Rong Guantuan brought back the Swaythling Cup, that China's ping pong began to flourish, and it soon became the undisputed "kingdom" of this sport.

For an entire 30 years, in the very place where it all began, the results of the 40th World Table Tennis Championships have sounded an alarm for Chinese ping pong.

The Rise and Fall

This World Championships saw athletes from four countries hoisting the gold cup, a feat not seen in the past four championships. The president of the International Table Tennis Federation, Ogimura, commented that this indicates the decline of China's dominance and also shows a promising new development in the world of table tennis. Ogimura's joy was evident. However, people from different positions have different feelings about this.

In previous years, the Chinese team would bring back 7 or 6 trophies, making the World Championships final almost like a national championship. At that time, few people from other countries felt comfortable about it. It is no wonder that some Europeans, from the birthplace of ping pong, always tried to weaken China's advantage through rules and equipment.

Now, the Swedish men's team and athletes from other countries have caught up and even surpassed China. The day others rise, is the day we decline. Besides expressing our broad-minded joy and congratulations, we should also think about what we should do. It seems that in the near future, the world of table tennis will have three possible outcomes: First, the Chinese team, like 10 years ago when they lost, will go back, lie low, and quickly regain their advantage. Second, Chinese table tennis will decline and its dominant position will be taken over by others. Third, it will enter a period of intense competition. The third possibility is the most likely.

The Root of the Defeat

This time, the Chinese team lost in the men's events. To revive the glory of the "Ping Pong Kingdom," we must improve the men's team. Experience has once again shown us that without new players and new techniques, failure is inevitable. The Chinese women's team was able to sweep the three titles, which is closely related to having many strong new players. Before the World Championships, Adidas held a guessing contest among journalists from various countries, and no one guessed that the women's singles champion would be Qiao Hong. Many foreign journalists had never even heard of her name. They couldn't figure out how many such rising stars there were in the Chinese women's team.

The Chinese women's team not only has many new players but also has diverse playing styles, each with their own characteristics. The South Korean star Hyun Jung-hwa had to face the straight-handle loop attack of Hu Xiaoxin, the backhand chop of Ding Yaping, and the straight-handle long-pimple serve of Chen Zihe. In the end, she still couldn't get past the straight-handle loop attack of Qiao Hong. If there weren't so many people guarding the gates, if the four players had the same playing style, Hyun Jung-hwa might have already taken the champion's cup.

However, the Chinese men's team has few new players and cannot bear the heavy burden. Out of the 12 male players, basically only two playing styles exist. Except for Xu Zengtai and Chen Zhifeng, most are close-to-table attackers, making their playing style monotonous and having obvious technical flaws. Once they leave the table, they are at a loss. The Swedish team's main players, although their playing styles are similar, have more comprehensive techniques. They also targeted the Chinese players' strong first three shots, using the same strategy against them, and achieved significant results.

Grasping the Essence

The "Ping Pong Kingdom" is not just about having a large number of world-class players; it also has a solid foundation. This World Championships saw more than 100,000 spectators over the entire competition period.

Even more surprising is that the sports hall was filled with young people holding ping pong paddles, almost everyone could play a few decent shots. West Germany currently has tens of thousands of large and small ping pong clubs. With such a good foundation, it is not surprising that a pair of men's doubles world champions emerged.

In recent years, the number of people playing ping pong in China has been decreasing year by year. In the future, when important ping pong competitions are held in China, we can learn from the experience of this World Championships, not only to hold competitions but also to set up ping pong games, exhibitions, and other activities to attract more young people. As long as Chinese table tennis maintains a solid foundation, the "Ping Pong Kingdom" will not collapse.

　　“乒乓王国”何去何从
　　——采访第４０届世乒赛感想
    １９５９年以前，没有人把中国称为“乒乓王国”。自从那一年容国团捧回圣·勃莱德杯后，中国的乒乓球运动开始“发家”，随后便当之无愧地成为这一体育项目的“王国”。
    整整３０年，就在当年“发家”之地，第４０届世界乒乓球锦标赛的结果，给中国乒乓球敲响了警钟。
　此消彼长
    本届世乒赛共有４个国家的运动员登台高举金杯，这是近４届世乒赛所没有过的。国际乒联主席荻村评论说，这表明中国队优势的衰落，也说明世界乒乓球运动出现喜人的新发展。荻村先生高兴之情溢于言表。所处位置不同，中国人和外国人对此难有同样的情感。
    前些年中国队７个、６个奖杯一个劲往回抱，世乒赛决赛快成了中国全国锦标赛，那时其它国家从事乒乓球运动的人没几个心里感到舒畅的。难怪有些来自乒乓球发源地的欧洲人士，总是从规则、器材各方面想方设法削弱中国的优势。
    现在，瑞典男队和其他一些国家运动员赶上来，甚至超过中国。他人崛起之日，正是我们滑坡之时。对此我们除了应气量宽宏地表示高兴祝贺之外，也应想想自己怎么办。看来今后一段时间，世界乒坛无非三种可能：一、中国队像１０年前输了球那样，回去卧薪尝胆，很快夺回优势。二、中国乒乓球从此一蹶不振，优势地位被人取而代之。三、进入战国时代，激烈竞争若干年。第三种可能性最大。
　失利症结
    中国队这次输在男子项目。重振“乒乓王国”雄风主要在于把男队水平搞上去。经验再次告诉我们，没有新人新的技术，失败是难以避免的。中国女队能够包揽三项桂冠，同新手又多又强分不开。世乒赛开幕前，阿迪达斯公司在各国记者中举行猜奖，没有一人猜女单冠军是乔红。不少外国记者连听都没听说过她的名字，他们摸不透中国女队里到底有多少这样一鸣惊人的后起之秀。
    中国女队不仅新人多，而且打法多样，各有特点。南朝鲜名将玄静和连闯直拍弧圈两面攻的胡小新、横拍削球的丁亚萍、直拍长胶怪球的陈子荷三道关口，最后还是闯不过横拍弧圈快攻的乔红这一关。如果没有这么多人守关，如果４人打法相同，恐怕玄静和早把冠军杯抱走了。
    而中国男队新人少，挑不起重担。１２名男队员基本上只有两种打法，除许增才、陈志斌外，大都是近台攻击型，打法显得单调，技术上也有明显漏洞，一离台就束手无策。瑞典队几名主力虽然打法差不多，但他们技术比较全面，又针对中国选手前三板好的特点，以其人之道还治其人之身，也抓前三板，收效明显。
　抓住根本
    “乒乓王国”之称所以叫响，不仅在于拥有一大批世界级选手，还在于有雄厚的基础。这次世乒赛，整个赛期观众超过１０万人次。
    更使人惊讶的是，体育馆里到处可见拿着球拍的青少年，几乎人人都能像样地打几下。西德目前有上万个大大小小乒乓球俱乐部，有这么好的基础，涌现出一对男子双打世界冠军也就不足为奇了。
    这几年，中国打乒乓球的人一年比一年少，国内今后举办重要乒乓球赛时，也可以借鉴一下这次世乒赛的经验，既办比赛，又开设乒乓球游艺、展销等多种活动，把更多的青少年吸引来。只要中国乒乓球运动保持雄厚的基础，“乒乓王国”就不会解体。
