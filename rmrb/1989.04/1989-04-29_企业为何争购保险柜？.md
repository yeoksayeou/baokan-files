Safes, once neglected in warehouses, have suddenly become hot-selling items. Recently, the reporter visited or called more than 10 stores that sell safes. According to statistics, at least 500 safes were sold during this period. The buyers include individual business owners, government agencies, and more notably, industrial and commercial enterprises.

Bank officials are deeply concerned: as safes become more popular, more and more cash will be withdrawn from bank circulation and turnover. One safe is like a "small treasury"!

So, why are enterprises rushing to buy safes? The factory directors and managers explain: "We are forced to."

They say that starting from last September, banks began to tighten credit, claiming to have both savings and pressure, but in reality, they collect money as soon as they see it. This forces enterprises to keep cash on hand and engage in cash transactions, thus increasing the need for safes. Recently, several banks in Linyi conducted a large-scale cash inspection, and the results showed that more than 80% of the enterprises had varying degrees of cash hoarding!

At the same time, the phenomenon of carrying large amounts of cash for purchasing goods, which was once rare, has become commonplace. Recently, a company went to purchase goods and actually loaded the safe onto the truck, with five police officers escorting it. The safe contained 400,000 yuan!

Such a severe "circulation of funds outside the system" leads to difficulties in bank fund turnover, making it impossible to cash checks and drafts. Some savings offices even cannot pay deposits, causing the bank's credit to decline. Many wealthy individual business owners do not care about the bank's interest and simply buy safes to store money themselves, just for convenience. This, in turn, forces the banks to open up again and issue more currency.

How to solve this problem has become an unavoidable new topic in current economic work.

### 企业为何争购保险柜？

　　企业为何争购保险柜？
    一向冷落在仓库的保险柜突然变成了热销货。记者近日连续走访或电话询问了１０多家经营保险柜的商店。据统计，在这段时间至少售出５００台保险柜。争购保险柜的有个体户、机关单位，更多的还是工商企业。
    银行同志对此深感忧虑：随着保险柜的热销，越来越多的现金将脱离银行流通和运转。一台保险柜就是一座“小金库”！
    那么，企业究竟为何争购保险柜呢？厂长、经理们的回答是：“这是逼的”。
    他们说，从去年９月起，银行开始紧缩银根，说是有保有压，实际上是见钱就收。这就逼着企业有钱不存银行，大搞现金交易，因此保险柜的用场多了。前不久，临沂几家银行联合进行现金大检查，结果８０％以上的企业程度不同地坐支现金！
    与此同时，过去极为鲜见的携带巨额现金外出购货的现象如今也司空见惯了。有一家公司最近去进货居然将保险柜搬上货车，由５名民警押送。保险柜里装有４０万元巨款！
    如此严重的资金“体外循环”，导致银行资金周转不灵，无法兑付汇票、支票。有的储蓄所甚至无法支付存款，致使银行信誉下降。不少腰缠万贯的个体户，不在乎银行那几个利息，索性买来保险柜自己存钱，只图用起来方便。这就又迫使银行不得不再开口子，发票子。
　　如何解决这个问题，已经成为当前经济工作中不容回避的新课题。
