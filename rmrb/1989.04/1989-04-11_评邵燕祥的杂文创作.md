He realized himself through essays

According to Shao Yanxiang's preface to "One Hundred Pieces of Joy and Sorrow," his first essay, "Starting from the Tongue," was published on April 20, 1946, in the supplement of a newspaper in Jinzhou. From that time, his personal history of essay writing spans a full 43 years. However, there was a gap of several decades in between. During these decades, Shao Yanxiang was known as a poet and basically did not write essays. Recently, around 1984, he could no longer resist the surge of emotions and began writing essays again. He wrote diligently and increasingly more. In recent years, several collections of his essays have been published, including "Honey and Thorns," "Morning and Evening Random Notes," "Selections of Contemporary Essays: Shao Yanxiang's Volume," "Green Light Collection," and "One Hundred Pieces of Joy and Sorrow."

Yanxiang's essays, with their depth and elegance, have resonated with many readers and produced a wide social impact. He is not only known as a poet but also as an essayist, establishing his position and image in contemporary Chinese literature. Modern youth often talk about "shaping oneself and realizing oneself." Using this expression, I think it can be said that Shao Yanxiang not only shaped and realized himself through poetry but also through essays. He is known for both his poetry and his prose, serving as a bridge between the two genres. Although he is a famous contemporary poet, I believe that his essays surpass his poetry in terms of overall impact.

An era gave birth to an essayist

I recall that in Shao Yanxiang's lyric poem "Farewell to Belgrade," there is a stanza: "How many coincidences are there in the world, and yet not all are coincidences. I do not believe in fate, but I believe in opportunities." As an individual, Yanxiang's path to essay writing is undoubtedly filled with many "coincidences," but the rise of essays as a genre is "not all coincidences" and has a deep historical necessity. Yanxiang happened to be on the crest of the wave of essay writing, so to speak, and he seized the opportunity.

Firstly, the rapid social and historical changes required essays. The origin of Chinese essays is not something I have studied in depth, so I cannot make a definitive statement. According to Feng Xuefeng, they began with the pre-Qin philosophers; another theory places their origin in the Wei and Jin dynasties. Both of these periods were times of drastic social change. As for modern essays, their beginning is undoubtedly with the May Fourth literary revolution. By the 1930s, they had reached a pinnacle of brilliance. Lu Xun is the greatest representative. It was Lu Xun who truly made essays an independent genre. After the May Fourth movement, China has been in a state of constant change and turmoil. In times of great change, various social forces take the stage, while old things stubbornly refuse to leave the historical stage, continuing to rot, decay, and poison people's spirits, obstructing the progress of history. This requires essays to use ridicule and satire to expose, criticize, and sweep away these issues. Essayists thus have a place to show their talents and take the stage.

The existence of social justice is undoubtedly the fertile soil for the growth of essays, but there must also be a relatively open cultural environment. In the 1980s, society became more open, and writers had more freedom of speech. They could discuss literature, politics, and various other issues. This was perhaps the external environment for the rise of essays. Of course, it was not all smooth sailing, but things were definitely different. Moreover, minor setbacks only made essayists more inspired. Thus, Shao Yanxiang, at this moment, transitioned from the realm of poetry to the peak of essay writing.

True emotions and character supporting courage and insight

If we say that another era of essays has begun and it has experienced its initial prosperity, then Shao Yanxiang is the main representative of this era. In 1984, when he turned his creative wisdom from poetry to the realm of essays, he started at a relatively high level. His works that year were quite notable and became the pinnacle of essay writing in that year.

Yanxiang's essays reflect his entire character and artistic personality. It is this character and personality that support his writing style. Essays often use subtle hints, but they more often need sharp edges. Therefore, it is easiest to see the author's true emotions and character: whether they are broad-minded, malicious, noble, or vulgar, nothing escapes the author's eyes.

Historians talk about historical integrity, and writers talk about literary integrity. The goodness or badness, highness or lowness of this literary integrity all depend on the author's character. Yanxiang's works can fully reveal a true modern intellectual's concern for the fate of the nation and the people's suffering, reflecting a profound and broad sense of crisis.

Yanxiang's essays are a way of his existence. He has a stubborn pursuit of truth, with a spirit of "I love my teacher, but I love truth more." In his life, he has paid a high price for this, even suffering head injuries and bloodshed. But this has not changed his unwavering pursuit. In the epilogue poem of his award-winning poetry collection "In the Distance," he still repeatedly sings, "Dear, dear, dear Party, I am your unrepentant son."

In terms of aesthetics, Yanxiang belongs to the school of truth and realism. When evaluating literature, truthfulness is always the highest standard. His writing is filled with genuine emotions, with a strong sense of reality, for the country, for the people, and for life.

The value of Yanxiang's essays lies mainly in the courage and insight supported by his true emotions and character. First, there is insight. Only then can emotions be expressed without being empty or superficial. He has a unique perspective on history and life, thinking independently and not following the crowd. His essays such as "Spring Festival Talk about Causing Trouble," "Reflections on Bacon's Excellence and Vileness," "Critique of 'Great Critique,'" and "The Theory of 'Mother Beating Son'" are all dissections of a common social mentality or value concept. His rational scalpel often cuts into places where general people's understanding stops, into places where people are used to seeing, revealing what others have not revealed, showing his depth. Yanxiang's essay blades often point towards great evil and ugliness. In Lu Xun's words, it is about daring to draw the sword against the strong. This courage and fearlessness make his essays full of vigor and grandeur, not trivial, not constrained, without flattery, and with spirit.

Yanxiang has a strong and sharp rationality, hating evil like a disease, but does not go to extremes, not speaking in absolutes. Behind his cold dissection and criticism, there is often a deep sense of tolerance. I know that despair and sadness often attack his heart, but he never passes this on to the reader; he does not have the heart to do so. His essays such as "On Suicide" and "The Upright and the Upright" have deep indignation, but they firmly cast an optimistic gaze towards the future, not wanting the reader's heart to grow cold.

As a poet, deep and sharp rationality has been an important feature of his poetry, giving his poetry a strong thought-provoking power and profound implications, but sometimes it becomes a burden for certain works due to its overtness. This rationality, when applied to essays, becomes the sharp edge and essence of his essays. And the poetic temperament and skills he has accumulated and honed over decades of poetry writing make his essays full of emotional surges, overflowing with poetic sentiment. His language is clear and bright, like flowing clouds and water, without traces of carving, often revealing implied meanings and profound intentions. He does not particularly pay attention to the construction of structure, so there is a natural charm. But there are also many pieces that, due to spontaneous writing, lose depth in meaning.

　　评邵燕祥的杂文创作
　　何西来
    他用杂文实现了自我
    按邵燕祥在《忧乐百篇》前记中的追溯，他的第一篇杂文《由口舌说起》是１９４６年４月２０日在锦州的一家报纸的副刊发表的。从那时算起，他个人从事杂文写作的历史，该是整整４３个春秋了。但中间有几十年的间隔。这几十年，邵燕祥以诗人名；基本上不写杂文了。近期，大致从１９８４年前后开始，他终于耐不住感兴云集的冲击，又着手写杂文了。而且一发而不可收，写作很勤奋，愈写愈多。这几年，先后面世的杂文集有《蜜和刺》、《晨昏随笔》、《当代杂文选粹·邵燕祥之卷》、《绿灯小集》、《忧乐百篇》等。
    燕祥的杂文，以其深邃和潇洒而赢得了众多读者的共鸣，产生了广泛的社会效应。他不仅作为诗人，而且作为杂文家，在当代中国文坛上确定了自己的位置，建立了自己的形象。现代青年常讲“塑造自我，实现自我”。套用这种表达方式，我看可以说，邵燕祥不仅用诗，而且用杂文塑造了自我，实现了自我。他既以诗名，也以文名，是兼跨两种文体的使者。尽管他已是当代著名诗人，但就其总体来说，我以为杂文在诗之上。
　时代造就了一位杂文家
    记得邵燕祥在抒情诗《贝尔格莱德别情》里有这样一个诗节：“人间有多少偶然，又不都是偶然／我不信命运，却相信有机缘”。作为个人，燕祥之走上杂文创作道路，肯定有许多“偶然”，但杂文作为一种文体的勃兴，却“又不都是偶然”，而是有其深刻的历史必然性的。燕祥恰恰在杂文勃兴的浪头上，成了杂文家，可以说适逢其会，用他自己“相信”的话说，叫“机缘”。
    首先是急剧推进的社会历史变革需要杂文。中国的杂文，究竟始于何代，我没有专门研究过，不好妄断。据冯雪峰讲，始于先秦诸子；一说始于魏晋。这两个时代都是剧烈的社会变动期。至于现代杂文，肇始于“五四”文学革命，倒是确定无疑的。到了３０年代，达极辉煌的顶点。鲁迅是最伟大的代表。正是鲁迅使杂文真正成为一门独立的文体。“五四”以后的中国，一直处于不断的变革和剧烈的动荡之中。大变革的时代，各种社会势力登台表演，而旧事物也顽固地不肯退出历史舞台，继续霉烂、腐败，毒化人们的精神，阻碍历史的前进，这便需要杂文用嘻笑怒骂的方式，揭露之，鞭挞之，扫荡之。杂文家也因而有了用武之地，纷纷登场。
    社会正义的存在固然是杂文生长的沃土，但还要有相对开放的文化环境。进入８０年代，社会开放得多了，文人们有了较多的言论自由，可以议文，可以议政，可以议各种各样的问题了。这大约是杂文勃兴的外部环境。当然并不是一切顺利，万事大吉，但毕竟不同了。而且小的不顺当反而会更使杂文家灵感潮涌。于是，邵燕祥在这样的时刻，从诗国走向杂文的峰巅。
　真性情、真人格支撑的胆和识
    如果说，又一个杂文的时代开始了，并且经历了它最初的繁荣，那么邵燕祥便是这个时代的主要代表。１９８４年，当他把自己的创作智慧从诗国转向杂文的天地时，一开始，起点便比较高。他的作品，在这一年很见光彩，成为当年杂文创作中的翘楚。
    燕祥的杂文，体现着他的整个人格，体现着他的艺术个性。正是这人格，这个性，支撑着他的创作风格。杂文时见曲笔，但更需要锋芒。因此，最易见出作者的真情性、真人格：宽和、忌刻、高洁、卑污，都难逃出作者的眼睛。
    史家讲史德，文人讲文德。这文德之善恶高下，均系于作者的人格。燕祥的作品，完全可以从中看出一个真正有良心、有血性的现代知识者对国运民疾的关切，这里透露着一种博大深沉的忧患意识。
    燕祥的杂文，是他生命的一种存在方式。他有执拗地追求真理的精神，有那么一股“吾爱吾师，吾更爱真理”的劲头。在他的生命史上，曾因此而碰得头破血流，付出过高昂的代价。但这并没有改变他“虽九死其犹未悔”的执著。他在自己的获奖诗集《在远方》的代跋诗中，依旧反复吟咏着“亲爱的，亲爱的，亲爱的党，／我是你永不悔改的儿子。”
    在美学观念上，燕祥属于崇真尚实一派。衡人论文，总以真实为最高尺度。他的文字，是血写的真情性，有着切切实实的现实针对性，为国、为民、为人生。
    燕祥杂文的价值，主要在于他由真情性、真人格的支撑的胆与识。首先是见识。而后情采才能有所附丽，不致凌虚蹈空。他对历史，对人生，一般都有独特的观察角度，思维角度，不随俗，不盲从。他的《元宵话起哄》、《有感于培根的杰出与卑鄙》、《批判“大批判”》、《“娘打儿子”论》等，都是对一种普遍的社会心态或价值观念的解剖。他的理性的解剖刀，常在一般人认识止步的地方，人们司空见惯的地方切入，发人所未发，显示出自己的深度。燕祥的杂文的锋刃常常向着大恶大丑。用鲁迅的话说，叫做敢于抽刃向强者。这种勇毅和无畏，使他的杂文气韵盛而格局大，不琐碎，不局促，无媚态，有风骨。
    燕祥有坚强犀利的理性，疾恶如仇，却不走极端，不把话讲绝。在他冷峻的解剖与抨击的后面往往深藏着宽厚的思绪。我知道，绝望和悲凉常袭击他的心，但他决不把这传递给读者，他不忍心。他的《说自杀》、《肖与不肖》等，既有深沉的愤激，却又坚定地把乐观的眼光投向未来，决不愿让读者心冷。
    作为诗人，深邃、犀利的理性曾是他诗歌创作的重要特点之一，使他的诗歌具有强烈的思想启迪力和耐人寻味的意蕴，但有时也因其过露而成为某些作品之累。这种理性，一旦用于杂文，就成为他杂文的锋芒和精髓。而他在几十年诗歌创作中所积累和磨砺出的诗人的气质与功力，则使他的杂文充满着情感的涌动，流溢着诗情。他的语言，清朗晓畅，似行云流水，无斧凿痕，常见弦外之音，韵外之旨。他并不特别注意结构的营造，因而颇有天然之趣。但也有不少篇什，因率意挥洒而文意失之平浅。
