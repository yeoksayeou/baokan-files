When the “Third Wave” swept through American society, there were concerns that the widespread use of computer technology would lead to an excess of labor. However, in recent years, the opposite has been observed: a large number of women have entered the labor market, occupying two-thirds of the jobs created in the ten years following the mid-1970s; elderly workers have extended their working lives; and many companies, in urgent need of "human capital," have accelerated their training programs. John Naisbitt, advisor to the U.S. State Department and author of "Megatrends," points out in his new book "Challenges of the 1990s" that in the last few decades of this century, new economic demands and new value concepts will increasingly emerge. Faced with this challenge, in an increasingly tight labor market, how should enterprises and other organizations redesign their structures and work to attract more talent? What new skills should people learn to adapt to the requirements of the "new information society," and how should they learn them? The book provides rich data and offers straightforward yet inspiring answers to these questions. The author identifies ten trends that will drive American businesses to recreate their companies and also analyzes ten issues to consider in the process of recreating companies. The book is translated by Yang Wenshi and published by the China Renmin University Press.

    当“第三次浪潮”席卷美国社会的时候，有人曾担心电脑技术的普及会带来劳动力过剩的局面。然而近年来却出现了相反的种种迹象：妇女大量涌入劳动力市场，占据了七十年代中期以后十年所创造的三分之二的工作岗位；老年职工延长了工作寿命；许多公司在非常需要“人力资本”的情况下，加快了培训的步伐。美国国务院顾问、《大趋势》的作者约翰·奈斯比特据此在新作《九十年代的挑战》中指出：在本世纪最后十几年中，将日益显露出新的经济需求和新的价值观念为特征的挑战。在这种挑战面前，在越来越趋于紧缺的劳动市场上，企业和其他组织为了增强对人才的吸引力，应如何重新设计自己的结构与工作？人们为了适应“新的信息社会”的要求，应当学习什么样的新技能及怎样学习？本书对这些问题，提供了丰富的资料，作出了通俗而富有启发性的回答。作者指出了促使美国工商界重新创造自己公司的十个趋势，也分析了在重新创造公司的过程中要考虑的十个问题。本书由杨文士翻译、中国人民大学出版社出版。
