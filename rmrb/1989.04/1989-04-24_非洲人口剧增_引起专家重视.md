    Africa's rapid population growth has raised serious concerns among experts. A senior official from the World Bank recently stated, "If Africa's population continues to grow at the current rate, the continent will face even greater challenges in addressing extreme poverty, rampant diseases, and environmental degradation."

    To address the increasingly worrisome population issues in Africa, the World Bank recently established a consultative committee in Abidjan, consisting of 15 experts on African population issues. The committee's role is to study the population situation in Africa, propose methods for population control, assist countries that have already implemented family planning programs to improve their work, and encourage other African countries to quickly develop their own population policies. On April 15th, this committee held a meeting at the headquarters of the African Development Bank in Abidjan. The attendees called on African governments to acknowledge the problems caused by rapid population growth and to incorporate "population factors into the overall national development policies."

    Africa's population has already exceeded 600 million, with an annual growth rate of 3%, which is the highest in human history and has surpassed the economic growth rate of the African continent. If Africa's population is not controlled, it is estimated that in the next 23 years, it will double again.

　　非洲人口剧增  引起专家重视
    本报阿比让４月２４日电  记者杨汝生报道：“非洲人口若是照目前的增长速度发展下去，该大陆将更加无法解决它所面临的极端贫困、疾病肆行和环境恶化问题”。世界银行一位负责人不久前这样说。为了研究日益令人担忧的非洲人口问题，不久前世界银行在阿比让设立了一个由１５位非洲人口问题专家组成的咨询委员会。委员会的作用是研究非洲人口形势，提出控制人口的办法，帮助已往实行家庭生育计划的国家把这一工作做好，鼓励其他非洲国家尽快制定自己的人口政策。本月１５日，这个委员会在阿比让的非洲开发银行总部召开了会议，与会代表呼吁非洲国家政府要正视人口剧增带来的问题，将“人口因素纳入国家的整个发展政策中去”。
    非洲人口现已超过６亿，年增长率为３％，乃是“人类历史上最高的”，已经超过非洲大陆的经济增长率。非洲人口若得不到控制，预料在未来的２３年间将会再翻一番。
