    The Soviet Union has been adjusting its policy towards Africa in recent years as the global situation has shown signs of easing. This is mainly reflected in the following areas:

    The Soviet Union advocates resolving regional disputes through negotiations and reducing confrontation in Africa. The Soviet Union advocates a peaceful resolution to the Horn of Africa issue and congratulates Somalia and Ethiopia on resuming diplomatic relations. It has significantly reduced military aid to Ethiopia, and the number of Soviet military advisors and experts in Ethiopia has also decreased considerably. Moscow has also announced that it will contribute to further dialogue between Ethiopia and Sudan. In the process of achieving peace in Southern Africa, although the Soviet Union did not directly participate in the four-party talks between Angola, Cuba, the United States, and South Africa, it has been actively mediating outside the talks, maintaining regular contact and consultations with the United States, and exerting influence on Angola and Cuba.

    The Soviet Union is actively developing bilateral and multilateral economic and trade relations, promoting economic diplomacy. In the past, a significant portion of the aid provided by the Soviet Union to African countries was military aid. Now, the Soviet Union emphasizes economic mutual benefit as the main focus of its aid to Africa. It has restored political and economic relations with Egypt. The two countries have signed a five-year trade agreement. According to this agreement, bilateral trade volume has increased from 1.3 billion Egyptian pounds in 1987 to 2 billion Egyptian pounds in 1988, and it is estimated that it will reach 3 billion Egyptian pounds during 1989-1990. The Soviet Union will participate in many development projects of Egypt's new five-year plan, with a total loan amount of 2.5 billion dollars.

    Last December, the Soviet Union also announced that it would extend the repayment period for Zambia's $300 million debt by 100 years. It also plans to cancel part of the debt of African countries and convert loans into grants. At the end of last year, when Côte d'Ivoire was at a loss due to the sharp drop in international cocoa prices, Moscow decided to purchase tens of thousands of tons of cocoa from Côte d'Ivoire at a price significantly higher than the international market price, which undoubtedly improved and promoted the relationship between the two countries.

    In Africa, the Soviet Union has changed its previous practice of "drawing a line with the Soviet Union" and is actively developing friendly relations with all African countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, it has successively restored diplomatic relations with Côte d'Ivoire and Liberia. Its relations with Sudan, Morocco, Tunisia, Somalia, and Guinea have also significantly improved. In May last year, Egypt's Vice Premier and Foreign Minister visited the Soviet Union, the first visit by a high-level Egyptian official to the Soviet Union in 12 years, marking a new stage in the normalization of relations between the two countries.

    The adjustments made by the Soviet Union in its policy towards Africa have improved its past image in Africa. In particular, it has improved relations with some African countries that have closer ties with the West, expanding Soviet influence. However, it should also be noted that the Soviet Union's adjustments in its policy towards Africa are just beginning, and its policy towards Africa will still face various challenges.

　　苏联调整对非关系
    本报记者  杨汝生
    近年来，随着世界形势出现缓和趋势，苏联也在相应调整对非洲的政策。主要表现在：
    主张通过谈判解决地区争端，减少在非洲的对抗。苏联主张非洲之角问题和平解决，对索马里和埃塞俄比亚复交表示祝贺。它对埃塞俄比亚的军事援助已大大削减，苏联在埃的军事顾问和专家的人数也减少许多。莫斯科还宣布，它将对埃塞俄比亚和苏丹的进一步对话作出贡献。在实现南部非洲的和平进程中，苏联虽然没有直接参加安、古、美和南非４方会谈，但它在会外积极斡旋，与美国保持经常的联系和磋商，并对安、古两国施加影响。
    积极发展双边和多边经贸关系，推行经济外交。过去苏联在向非洲国家提供的援助中，相当一部分为军援。现在，苏联对非援助强调以经济互利合作为主。它与埃及的政治和经济关系已经恢复。两国签署了一项为期５年的经贸协定。根据这项协定，双边贸易额已从１９８７年的１３亿埃磅增加到１９８８年的２０亿埃磅，估计１９８９—１９９０年间，可达３０亿埃磅。苏联将参加埃及新的五年计划的许多发展项目，贷款总数高达２５亿美元。
    苏联去年１２月还宣布，将赞比亚拖欠的３亿美元的债务的偿还期限延长１００年。它还打算取消非洲国家的部分债务，将贷款转为赠款。去年年底，正当科特迪瓦为国际市场可可价格暴跌一筹莫展之时，莫斯科毅然决定以大大高于国际市场的价格，从科购买数万吨可可，这无疑改善并促进了两国的关系。
    在非广交朋友，开展“全方位”外交。苏联改变过去“以苏划线”的作法，积极发展与所有非洲国家的友好关系。在黑非洲，它先后同科特迪瓦和利比里亚恢复了外交关系。它与苏丹、摩洛哥、突尼斯、索马里和几内亚的关系也大大改善。去年５月，埃及副总理兼外交部长访苏，这是１２年以来埃及一位高级官员对苏的首次访问，标志着两国关系正常化发展到一个新阶段。
    苏联对非政策所作的这些调整，改善了苏联过去在非洲的形象。特别是与某些同西方关系较密切的非洲国家改善了关系，扩大了苏联的影响。但也应看到，苏联对非政策的调整还刚起步，苏联的对非政策仍会面临各种考验。
