The General: Among the 16 pieces, I hold the highest position, yet I have the least freedom.

The Chariot: I charge straight ahead all my life, an unyielding hero. Even the opponent's general doesn't dare to confront me, yet sometimes I meet my end at the feet of a lowly pawn.

The Horse: If all the roads in the world were flat and straight, the only path I could take would be: suicide!

The Cannon: Beware! I can strike you from an unseen place with a fierce blow.

The Advisor: I am both the general's personal bodyguard and the one who can put the general in a fatal corner—when a stalemate occurs.

The Elephant: Busy flying up and down, my tasks are clear: one, to protect my master's life, and two, to protect my own life.

The Pawn: Though I move slowly, who has ever seen me retreat a step?

　　象棋的哲学
    帅：在１６枚子中，地位最高的是我，自由度最小的也是我。
    车：横冲直撞一生英雄，连对方的老将也不敢和我打照面，可有时我却屈死在小卒脚下。
    马：如果世上的路全都又平又直，容我走的就只有一条：自杀！
    炮：小心！我会从看不见的地方狠狠给你一下。
    仕：我既是老帅的贴身保镖，也是置老帅于死地的得力帮凶——当出现闷宫的时候。
    象：忙着飞上飞下，任务只有两个：一保主子命，二保自己命。
　　卒：行动虽慢，可谁曾见我退过一步？
