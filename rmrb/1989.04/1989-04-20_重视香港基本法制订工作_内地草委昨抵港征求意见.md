According to Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, April 20th: Led by Wang Hanbin, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Vice Chairman of the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee, the first batch of mainland members of the Drafting Committee arrived in Hong Kong by plane this noon to seek opinions from various sectors of Hong Kong on the draft of the Basic Law for Hong Kong.

Wang Hanbin said in a written statement at the airport today, "Fully soliciting, listening to, and seriously studying the opinions of various sectors of Hong Kong is an extremely important condition for doing a good job in drafting the Basic Law. This time, I and some mainland members of the Drafting Committee came here to listen to the opinions of various sectors on the draft of the Basic Law together with the members of the Drafting Committee in Hong Kong. Through the exchange of opinions, we will discuss and solve some of the different opinions that still exist in the draft." He expressed his belief that through everyone's joint efforts, the draft of the Basic Law can be revised to be more perfect.

The mainland members of the Drafting Committee who arrived in Hong Kong today also include Qian Weichang, Lu Ping, Xiang Chunyi, Wu Dayun, Wu Jianhuan, Xu Chongde, Rui Mu, and Lin Hengyuan. When the mainland members of the Drafting Committee arrived at the airport, An Zi Jie, Chairman of the Hong Kong Basic Law Consultative Committee, and others went to welcome them.

It is reported that the Hong Kong Basic Law Consultative Committee held a reception on April 20th to welcome Wang Hanbin and his delegation. Wang Hanbin said that as long as we adhere to the principle of "one country, two systems" and maintaining the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong, we can find common ground or reach a consensus through full exchange of opinions and discussion, and successfully complete the drafting of a Basic Law for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region that is satisfactory to the people of Hong Kong and the people of the whole country.

Wang Hanbin and his delegation will stay in Hong Kong for two weeks.
