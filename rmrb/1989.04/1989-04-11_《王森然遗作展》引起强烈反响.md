The exhibition of Wang Senran's posthumous works has sparked strong reactions since its opening at the China Art Museum in Beijing. The audience has been flocking to see the exhibition, standing in quiet contemplation before the myriad of works on display.

Liu Lantao, the president of the Wang Senran Academic Research Association, said: "Comrade Wang Senran achieved remarkable results in China's revolutionary and educational and academic fields, exerting a tremendous influence. Painting was relatively minor in his life, but it played a significant role in the era and the history of art. During the 'ten years of turmoil,' he was deprived of the right to write and conduct research, but with his indomitable will and creative passion, he picked up the paintbrush he had discarded for decades. With unique themes and styles, he expressed his personal integrity and artistic merit. His works, which capture the sorrow of the times and the nation, will have a profound impact."

The exhibition will close on the 16th.

　　《王森然遗作展》引起强烈反响
    本报讯　《王森然遗作展》在北京中国美术馆开幕以来，观众如潮，他们在琳琅满目的作品面前凝神静思。
    中国王森然学术研究会会长刘澜涛说：王森然同志在中国革命和中国教育、学术事业中都取得了丰硕的成果，产生了巨大的影响，绘画在他的整个生命中是非常次要的，但在时代和美术史上的作用却是非常重要的。“十年浩劫”中他被剥夺了写作研究的权利，但他以顽强的毅力和创作欲，拿起了扔掉几十年的画笔，以独特的题材和风格，表现他的人品和画品。他的作品录下的时代和民族的悲怆，将会产生深远的影响。
　　画展将于１６日闭幕。　　　　（陆燕）
