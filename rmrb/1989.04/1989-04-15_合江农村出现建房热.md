According to a survey conducted by the rural socio-economic investigation team of Heping County in our province, the per capita living space in rural areas reached 21.36 square meters in 1988, an increase of 53.7% compared to 1980.

In recent years, the reason for the building boom in rural areas is that some farmers believe that the prices of building materials are continuously rising, and it is better to build houses early rather than late. Therefore, they are willing to take on debt to build houses. Additionally, mutual comparison has accelerated the pace of construction.

Nowadays, farmers' requirements for housing have gone beyond just shelter from the wind and rain; they now seek spacious and comfortable living conditions, transforming single-story houses into multi-story buildings.

Similar issues are prevalent in the rural areas of our province. It is hoped that relevant departments will pay high attention to this matter.

### 合江农村出现建房热

　　合江农村出现建房热
    据我省合江县农村社会经济调查队对１２０户农民的调查，１９８８年人均住房面积达到２１．３６平方米，比１９８０年增长５３．７％。
    这几年，农村出现建房热的原因是：一些农民认为，建筑材料价格不断上涨，迟建房不如早建房，于是宁愿欠债也要建房。另外，相互攀比加快了建房速度。
    现在农民建房，已经不满足于遮风避雨的一般住所，而要求住得宽敞舒适，把平房改建为楼房。
    类似的问题，在我省农村普遍存在。希望有关部门能高度重视。
