In previous years, Tianjin had to import spring vegetables from other regions, but this year, not only are there plenty of locally grown celery, spinach, and bok choy in the markets, but the city has also, for the first time, exported spring vegetables to other areas.

Over the past ten days, on the roads leading to the suburbs, trucks and horse-drawn carts carrying vegetables to the city and other places have been constantly on the move. Officials from the Tianjin Municipal Vegetable Office reported that the city had originally planned to purchase 13 million kilograms of celery and spinach from the suburbs in April, but the actual market supply from April 1 to April 15 has already reached 16.34 million kilograms.

　　天津今年春菜自给有余
    据新华社天津四月二十一日电（记者殷可善）往年每到春季要从外地调菜吃的天津市，今年不仅市场上摆着大量当地出产的芹菜、菠菜、小白菜，而且破例向外地销售春菜。
    近十多天，在市郊一条条公路上，每天向城里、城外运菜的机动车、马车络绎不绝。天津市蔬菜办公室的同志介绍：市里原计划四月份从郊区按合同定购芹菜和菠菜一千三百万公斤，而四月一日到十五日的实际上市量已达一千六百三十四万公斤。
