Japanese Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru today met with Liberal Democratic Party Secretary-General Abe Shintaro, who is hospitalized, to discuss the successor to the prime minister. Takeshita nominated LDP General Affairs Committee Chairman Ito Masayoshi, and Abe agreed.

According to reports, the nomination of Ito Masayoshi has received widespread approval within the LDP. This afternoon, former LDP Secretary-General Sakurai and former Minister of Justice Inada met with Ito, asking him to take on the role of prime minister. Ito, at 75 years old, cited health reasons and declined the offer.

It is generally believed that, given that the originally designated successors to Takeshita, such as Abe and Miyazawa, are all implicated in the "Recruit scandal," the LDP, in order to change its image, reduce the decline in LDP seats in the upcoming summer House of Councillors election, and maintain the LDP's rule, has chosen Ito, who is unconnected to the scandal and has a clean image, as the best candidate.

Our reporter in Tokyo reported today that after Takeshita formally announced his retirement to the media yesterday, it was discovered this morning that Takeshita's former secretary, Aoki Ippei, had committed suicide at his residence. This is the first instance of a suicide related to the Recruit scandal, in which several people have been arrested or resigned.

During his tenure as Takeshita's secretary, Aoki Ippei was effectively Takeshita's financial manager, handling most of Takeshita's political funds. He played a key role in the 2,000 unlisted shares allegedly related to Takeshita and the 10,000 shares transferred to Takeshita's relatives. The recent discovery of a 50 million yen loan from Recruit Corporation's former chairman, Ezoe Masahisa, to Takeshita was also arranged by Aoki Ippei. The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office Special Investigation Department has already investigated Aoki Ippei.

Local sources believe that Aoki Ippei's suicide is a shock to the Japanese political scene. To avoid chaos, Takeshita will accelerate the process of government transition and may resign earlier than the planned end of May. The LDP has unanimously nominated Ito Masayoshi to succeed as prime minister. Whether Ito Masayoshi can take office has become the focus of the political situation.

　　竹下推举伊东接任首相  竹下前任秘书自杀身亡
    本报东京４月２６日电  记者于青报道：日本首相竹下登今天下午与因病住院的自民党干事长安倍协商接任首相人选问题。竹下推举自民党总务会长伊东正义出任，安倍表示同意。
    据报道，推举伊东正义接任首相，已得到自民党内普遍赞同。今天下午，自民党前干事长樱内和前法相稻叶面见伊东，请他出任首相，伊东以７５岁高龄和健康方面等原因，表示无意接受。
    一般认为，在原定竹下接班人安倍、宫泽等人都涉嫌“利案”的情况下，自民党为改变自身形象，减小夏季参院选举中自民党议席下降幅度，继续维持自民党政权，推举与“利案”无关，形象廉洁的伊东出马，是现在的最佳选择。
    本报东京４月２６日电　记者于青报道：昨天竹下首相向新闻界正式表明引退之意后，今天上午发现，竹下首相的前任秘书青木伊平在自己住所自杀身亡。因利库路特案件有多人被捕或辞职，出现自杀者还是首次。
    青木伊平在担任竹下秘书期间，相当于竹下的金库管理人，竹下的政治资金主要由他代管。涉嫌竹下首相的２０００股未公开上市股票，以及转让给竹下亲属的１万股股票，青木伊平都在其中扮演中介人的角色。最近发现的利库路特公司前会长江副正浩借给竹下的５０００万日元，也是由青木伊平一手操办。东京地方检察厅特别搜查部已对青木伊平进行了调查。
    此间人士认为，青木伊平的自杀对日本政界无疑是一次冲击，为避免出现混乱局面，竹下将加快政权更迭进程，可能早于预定的５月末正式辞职。自民党已举党一致推选伊东正义接任首相，伊东正义能否走马上任，成为政局焦点。
