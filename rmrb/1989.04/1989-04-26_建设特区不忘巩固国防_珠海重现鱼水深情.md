The concern of "Who will protect the 'Great Wall'?" in the frontline of the South China Sea in the Zhuhai Special Economic Zone has been eliminated. The 260,000 residents of the city, while developing the commodity economy, have not forgotten to strengthen national defense. Today, the Wanshan Islands have seen a revival of the deep bond between soldiers and civilians, which has been praised by central leaders.

After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, Zhuhai became a special economic zone, and the commodity economy developed rapidly. However, the city leaders believed that Zhuhai's strategic position is important and that national defense cannot be neglected. The city government stipulated that urban construction must be unified with national defense construction. In 1985, after the military downsized, the city allocated more than 1 million yuan to help the stationed troops maintain facilities such as sentry posts, watchtowers, roads, and warehouses. Over the years, the city has also allocated funds three times to help the stationed troops build housing. More than 500 eligible family members of the stationed troops have been given priority and have all been properly settled. For retired officers, especially those from old islands and old border defense units, the city has given warm care and proper arrangements. On Baili Island, there are 3 school-aged children from the military, and the education bureau specially dispatched a teacher to the island to teach.

　　建设特区不忘巩固国防
    珠海重现鱼水深情
    本报讯  “‘长城’护国土，谁来护‘长城’”的忧虑在南海前哨的珠海特区已被消除。２６万市民居安思危，发展商品经济不忘巩固国防。今日万山群岛，重现军民鱼水情谊，受到中央领导同志的赞扬。
    党的十一届三中全会后，珠海成为经济特区，商品经济迅速发展，但市领导认为珠海战略位置重要，国防不容忽视。市政府规定，城市建设必须和国防建设统一起来。１９８５年部队裁员以后，市里专门拨款１００多万元，帮助驻军保护哨所、岗楼、道路、仓库等设施。几年来，还先后三次拨款，帮助驻军修建住房。５００多名符合条件的随军家属，优先照顾，全部妥善安置。对转业进珠海的干部，特别是对老海岛、老边防热情照顾，妥当安排。白沥岛有３名部队适龄儿童，教育局专门派一名老师上岛施教。　　　　　　　　　　（李石元）
