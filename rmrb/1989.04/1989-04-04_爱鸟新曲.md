Title: New Song of Bird Lovers

Among the hundreds of bird species that breed and inhabit Czechoslovakia, a new species has recently joined them—the white stork.

Groups of white storks have fallen in love with the scenic East Slovakian region. Every year, over 600 white stork nests can be found here. These birds, which love water and aquatic creatures, have an unusual habit—they prefer to build their nests on the tops of electrical poles. The crisscrossing wires and invisible electrical currents often pose a threat to their lives. To protect these proud children of nature, the Slovakian government decided to relocate the storks. Recently, the cultural and natural heritage protection unit of East Slovakia, along with the Košice Power Plant, spent 664,000 korunas (10 korunas approximately equal to 1 USD) to erect a wooden pole next to each electrical pole with a stork nest. They then constructed a new nest on top of the wooden pole, allowing the storks and their offspring to reside there safely.

Czechoslovakia is a country with a tradition of loving birds. As early as the 18th century, bird hunting was prohibited here. In 1938, 100 nature reserves were established nationwide. After liberation, a series of laws were enacted to protect animals and plants. In 1986, the government declared 1,503 forests, rivers, and lakes across the country as biological reserves, and took various measures to protect rare birds and animals.

　　爱鸟新曲
    在捷克斯洛伐克繁衍栖息的数百种鸟类中，近年来又增飞来新客——白鹳。
    群群白鹳爱上了山青水秀的东斯洛伐克州。每年在这里都可发现６００多个白鹳巢穴。这些酷爱水流和鱼虾的珍鸟也有一种怪僻——爱在电线杆顶端筑巢。交错的电线，无形的电流常对其生命构成威胁。为了保护这些大自然的骄子，斯洛伐克政府决定，为白鹳迁巢。最近，东斯洛伐克州的文物和大自然保护单位同科希策电力工厂用６６．４万克朗（１０克朗约合１美元），在每根白鹳巢穴的电线杆旁，树起一根木柱，在上面仿造一个新巢。让白鹳及其后代在那里安然栖身。
    捷克斯洛伐克是一个有爱鸟传统的国家，早在１８世纪这里就禁止捕鸟。１９３８年时，全国就宣布了１００个自然保护区。解放后制定了一系列保护动植物的法令。１９８６年，政府又宣布全国１５０３处的森林、河流、湖泊为生物保护区，并采取种种措施保护珍禽异兽。
