The second round of the Aisin Cup final has determined a winner: Nie Weiping, a 9th dan player, defeated Cho Chikun, also a 9th dan player, by 9 points. This result makes the final outcome of the cup unpredictable. Today's match result has made the final destination of the Aisin Cup uncertain once again: Nie Weiping, a 9th dan player, playing white, defeated Cho Chikun, a 9th dan player, by 9 points, tying the total score to 1-1. Therefore, regardless of the outcome of the third round in Ningbo on May 3rd, this professional Go tournament will not be able to hold a closing ceremony on the Chinese mainland.

This game was similar to the one on the 25th where Cho Chikun won, but today Nie Weiping's advantage was more significant. In terms of the overall situation, this game seemed to better embody the intentions of the white player.

It is still unclear why Nie Weiping played so smoothly today. His moves were swift, and he appeared confident, especially when the black piece placed the seventh move. He quickly responded with white 8. In the end, Nie Weiping only used 1 hour and 55 minutes, while Cho Chikun had used up the allotted 3 hours and entered the reading time.

The match started at 10 AM and was sealed at the 55th move for a one-hour break. The game resumed at 1 PM and ended at 4:16 PM, totaling 245 moves.

　　应氏杯决赛第二盘见分晓    
    聂卫平九点胜曹薰铉
    本报杭州４月２８日电  记者温子健报道：今天的比赛结果使应氏杯的最后归属又变得难以预测了：聂卫平九段执白以９点的优势战胜了曹薰铉九段，使双方的总比分成为１∶１。这样，无论５月３日在宁波进行的第三回合较量孰胜孰负，这届职业围棋赛都将不可能在中国大陆举行闭幕式。
    这盘棋同２５日曹九段取胜的情形不无相似，不过，今天聂卫平九段取得的优势更大些。就整个形势而言，这盘棋似乎更多地贯彻了白棋的意图。
    还无法确知聂卫平今天为何下得这么轻松，他行棋落子飞快，显得胸有成竹，尤其当黑子刚刚布下第七手时，他手起子落，紧接着走出了白８。最后聂卫平只用了一小时５５分钟，而曹薰铉已用光了规定的３小时并且进入了读秒。
    比赛从上午１０点开始，下至第５５手时封盘休息，一小时之后续弈，下午４点１６分结束，共２４５手。
