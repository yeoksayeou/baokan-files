More than 150 residents of Coal Ash Alley in Beijing's Dongcheng District wrote a joint letter to this newspaper and the Beijing Municipal Government on March 5, reporting the problem of noise pollution from Wangfu Hotel. The Beijing Municipal Government immediately tasked the municipal environmental protection bureau with investigating and handling the issue on March 9. The bureau director, along with relevant department heads, engineers, and Dongcheng District environmental protection bureau officials, conducted three on-site investigations. They measured the noise levels in the residential area adjacent to Wangfu Hotel, finding that daytime noise levels reached 72 to 76 decibels, and nighttime noise levels were also high, exceeding national noise control standards and directly affecting the normal lives of nearby residents.

Prior to this, the municipal environmental protection bureau had repeatedly informed the hotel that noise levels must be below the national environmental noise standards. The hotel verbally agreed, stating, "If in the future there are instances where the standards are not met, we will take full responsibility."

Given this situation, to protect the health of residents, the director of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau urgently met with the manager of Wangfu Hotel on the afternoon of March 13, ordering them to take effective measures within a time limit to rectify the noise pollution. This was the first time the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau used this method since its establishment. At the same time, the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau handed the hotel a decision to eliminate noise pollution within a time limit, requiring Wangfu Hotel to:

1. To ensure residents' nighttime rest, within three days of receiving this decision, stop all operations of facilities that exceed environmental noise standards from 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM daily.

2. To ensure the tranquility of the residential environment day and night, complete the installation of all noise pollution control facilities by the end of April and meet the national regional environmental noise standards. The facilities can only be put into use after passing the environmental protection bureau's inspection.

3. By the end of March, report to the environmental protection bureau for review the situation of other pollution sources that exceed national and Beijing Municipal environmental protection standards, the rectification plan, and the completion date.

4. The environmental protection bureau will impose penalties on the hotel according to relevant regulations.

Currently, the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau continues to monitor Wangfu Hotel to ensure the implementation of the above decisions. The bureau's swift and decisive enforcement, ensuring that actions are followed through, has been praised by residents. Residents are also closely watching whether Wangfu Hotel will comply with the decisions of the environmental protection bureau.

　　北京市环境保护局执法如山  责成王府饭店限期治理噪声
    本报记者  顾雷  刘建华
    北京市东城区煤渣胡同一百五十多个居民三月五日联名给本报和北京市政府写信，反映王府饭店噪声扰民的问题。北京市政府九日即责成市环保局调查处理。市环保局局长带领有关处长、工程师及东城区环保局负责人三次到现场调查，测得与王府饭店相邻的居民区白天噪音高达七十二至七十六分贝，夜间噪声也不小，超过了国家控制的噪声标准，直接影响到邻近居民的正常生活。
    在此之前，市环保局已多次向这家饭店提出，噪声必须低于国家规定的环境噪声标准。这家饭店口头上作了承诺，表示“今后如有达不到国家规定标准的情况，愿负全部责任”。
    鉴于这种情况，为维护居民的健康，北京市环保局局长十三日下午紧急约见王府饭店经理，责成他们限期采取有效措施，治理噪声。这是北京市环保局成立以来，第一次使用这种方式。同时，北京市环保局交给饭店一份限期消除噪声污染的决定书，要求王府饭店：
    一、为保证居民夜间休息，在接到本决定三日后，每天从二十二点至次日六点，停止一切超过环境噪声标准的设施运行。
    二、为保证居民昼夜环境的安宁，必须于四月底前完成全部防治噪声污染设施的安装，并达到国家区域环境噪声规定的标准，经环保局验收方可投入使用。
    三、于三月底前将其它超过国家和北京市环境保护标准的污染源的情况、治理方案及完成日期报环保局审查。
    四、环保局根据有关规定对饭店予以处罚。
    目前，北京市环保局正继续对王府饭店进行监测，以督促执行上述决定。北京市环保局这种雷厉风行、执法不苟，一抓到底的作风，受到居民的赞扬。同时，居民也在注视着王府饭店是否执行市环保局的决定。
