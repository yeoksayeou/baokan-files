The United Nations Security Council held a meeting today. Panama's foreign minister, Jorge Eduardo Roldán, accused the United States of interfering in Panama's elections and making threats of force.

This meeting was convened at the request of Panama's permanent representative to the United Nations, Jorge Eduardo Roldán. In a letter to the Security Council president, Roldán stated, "The United States has openly and covertly, directly and indirectly, infringed upon the sovereignty, political independence, economic security, and territorial integrity of the Republic of Panama, causing the situation to deteriorate seriously."

Roldán stated in his speech that U.S. President George H.W. Bush had recently secretly allocated $10 million to Panama's opposition for use in the May 7 elections, which is a blatant interference in Panama's internal affairs. The United States is also attempting to create chaos in Panama to find an excuse for direct military intervention. This would threaten international peace and security, as well as global maritime and trade activities.

U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations, Thomas Pickering, also spoke at the meeting. He accused Panama's crisis of being rooted in the erroneous policies of (Panamanian President) Manuel Noriega, including drug trafficking and arms smuggling. Pickering expressed deep doubts about the fairness and freedom of the elections held by the Noriega regime, citing the closure of radio stations, television stations, and newspapers, as well as the tampering of voter registration lists. Pickering also stated that the United States would send representatives to observe the election process in Panama.

　　联合国安理会开会    
    巴拿马控诉美国
    本报联合国４月２８日电  记者刘开宸报道：巴拿马外长乔治·里特今天在安理会会议上控诉美国干涉巴拿马大选和进行武力威胁。
    这次会议是应巴拿马常驻联合国代表卡姆的要求召开的。卡姆在给安理会主席的信中说，“美国公开和隐蔽地、直接和间接地侵害巴拿马共和国的主权、政治独立、经济安全和领土完整，致使局势严重恶化”。
    里特在发言中说，美国总统布什最近秘密下令拨款１０００万美元供巴拿马反对派在５月７日举行的大选中使用是公然干涉巴拿马内政，美国还企图在巴拿马制造混乱，为直接武装干涉寻找借口。这将威胁国际和平与安全以及世界的航运和贸易。
    美国常驻联合国代表托马斯·皮克林也在会上发言。他指责说巴拿马危机的根源在于（巴总统）诺列加的错误政策，其中包括贩卖毒品和走私武器。皮克林表示美国对诺列加政权举行的大选是否自由和公正深表怀疑，因为该政权封闭了电台、电视台和报纸，篡改选民登记单等。皮林克还说美国要派代表到巴拿马观察那里的选举过程。
