	Global oil prices soared today, reaching their highest point in three years. According to a report from our correspondent Liu Kaicheng in New York, various types of crude oil futures for May delivery at the New York Mercantile Exchange surged to their highest levels since January 1986.

	The price of American standard crude oil, West Texas Intermediate, reached $22.60 per barrel, while the price of North Sea Brent crude oil from the UK was $21.05 per barrel, and Saudi light crude oil was $19.10 per barrel. All of these prices increased by more than $1 compared to the previous day.

	The sharp rise in oil prices is due to the shutdown of some North Sea oil fields following an accident, which led to a 20% reduction in production. Additionally, the American Petroleum Institute reported that U.S. oil inventories decreased by 5.7 million barrels last week, which is 32 million barrels less than a year ago. These factors have contributed to the surge in oil prices.

　　世界油价猛涨    
    达三年来最高峰
    本报纽约４月１９日电  记者刘开宸报道：今天，纽约商品交易所里，各种原油５月份期货价格飞涨，达１９８６年１月以来最高峰。
    美国标准原油——西得克萨斯中质油每桶２２．６０美元，英国北海布伦特石油为２１．０５美元，沙特轻质油为１９．１０美元。都比前一天涨１美元以上。
    油价猛涨原因是部分北海油田因发生事故关闭后减产２０％。另外，美国石油研究所报告，美国上周的石油库存减少５７０万桶，比一年前少３２００万桶，这也促进了油价上涨。
