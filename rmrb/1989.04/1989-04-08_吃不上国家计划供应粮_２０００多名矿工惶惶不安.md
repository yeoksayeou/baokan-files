In October of last year, the eastern mining district of Zaozhuang in Shandong Province transferred a portion of its workers to the Jiangzhuang Coal Mine in the Tengnan mining district. The Tengzhou City Grain Bureau immediately transferred the grain allocation records of these workers to the Xigang Township Mining Grain Station. After accepting a batch of workers' grain allocation records, the grain station soon stopped accepting the grain allocation records of over 2,000 workers, citing insufficient grain storage and inadequate supply capacity. They demanded that the Jiangzhuang Coal Mine quickly build a grain station. The construction of a grain station involves funding, land acquisition, design, construction period, and other issues, which are not something the mine can decide on its own. Therefore, five months have passed, and the grain station has not been completed. Over 2,000 workers still cannot obtain state-allocated grain. The mine has had to purchase over 20,000 kilograms of high-priced grain each month. Starting in March, relevant units have run out of high-priced grain to sell, and the miners are anxious, seriously affecting coal production. It is suggested that the Tengzhou City Grain Bureau take emergency measures to open up grain supply channels and address the miners' urgent needs. Relevant departments in the coal industry should quickly plan to build a central grain station in the Jiangzhuang Coal Mine to meet the needs of the construction and development of the Tengnan mining district.

　　吃不上国家计划供应粮  ２０００多名矿工惶惶不安
    去年１０月，山东枣庄东部矿区将一部分职工调到滕南矿区蒋庄煤矿。滕州市粮食局当即将这些职工的粮食关系介绍到西岗镇矿区粮站。这个粮站接收了一批人的粮食关系，不久，便以粮库储量少，供粮能力达不到为由，停止接收２０００多名职工的粮食关系，并要求蒋庄煤矿尽快盖一座粮站。建粮站涉及资金、购地、施工设计、工程周期等问题，并非是矿上说了就算的。因而５个月过去了，粮站未建成，２０００多名职工仍吃不上国家计划供应粮。矿上不得不每月购高价粮２万多公斤。从３月起，有关单位已没有高价粮可卖了，矿工惶惶不安，煤炭生产受到严重影响。建议滕州市粮食局采取应急措施，疏通供粮渠道，解决矿工的燃眉之急。煤炭系统有关部门应尽快筹划在蒋庄煤矿建座矿区中心粮站，以适应滕南矿区建设和发展的需要。
