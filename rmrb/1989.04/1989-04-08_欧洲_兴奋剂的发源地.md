According to foreign publications, the first recorded instance of using stimulants to enhance performance in sports occurred in 1865. This incident took place during a swimming competition in the canals of Amsterdam, Netherlands.

In 1879, during a six-hour-long cycling race, athletes used coffee, sugar, and alcoholic beverages to boost their energy levels and enhance their competitive edge. This is the first documented case of the use of "performance-enhancing drugs" in sports.

These two examples can be considered the "pioneers" of performance-enhancing drugs. Unfortunately, there are no more detailed reports from that time. Since both incidents occurred in Europe, some people believe that Europe can be considered the "birthplace" of performance-enhancing drugs.

　　欧洲——兴奋剂的发源地
    据国外报刊报道，体育运动中第一次发现有人采用刺激神经兴奋的方式是在１８６５年。那是发生在荷兰的阿姆斯特丹运河泅渡比赛中。
    １８７９年，在一次持续６个小时的自行车比赛中，有运动员用咖啡、糖和酒精饮料来提高兴奋程度，以期增强竞争力。这是人们第一次确切地知道的运动中使用的“兴奋剂”。
    以上两个事例可称用兴奋剂的“先驱”，可惜当时没有更具体的报道。由于这两件事均发生在欧洲，有人认为可以把欧洲看作兴奋剂的“发源地”。
