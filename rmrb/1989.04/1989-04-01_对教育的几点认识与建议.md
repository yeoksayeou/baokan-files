An era of peace and development is upon us, and many countries are shifting their strategic focus to economics, science, and education. In this new era, education will be a crucial strategic industry for nations to survive, develop, and compete globally. Education will be a key determinant of humanity's future.

Currently, the people of the nation have high expectations for education, hoping it will truly become the foundation of the state and a strategic priority. This reflects a strong sense of the times, a love for our republic, and a belief in socialism.

"Education must face modernization, the world, and the future." Comrade Xiaoping's inscription for Beijing's Jing Shan School outlines the strategic direction for developing our country's education.

The primary goal of our socialist education should be to cultivate talents for various modern industries, build a powerful army of knowledge workers, enhance the quality of all ethnic groups, and contribute outstanding individuals to humanity.

Education is a vast social engineering project. Under the conditions of modern large-scale production and socialist commodity economy, a new, complete educational system must be formed:

- The school education system, from kindergartens, primary schools, middle schools to universities, primarily tasked with foundational knowledge education.
- The professional training system, providing diverse forms of specialized training for workers in various industries.
- The social cultural system, encompassing television, radio, film, publications, as well as museums, libraries, and cultural centers for various cultural and artistic activities.

Education must be opened up and liberalized, correcting the long-standing highly centralized, unified educational system. Education is a great cause for the entire society. We must open up educational pathways, allowing enterprises, townships, communities, and overseas Chinese, as well as domestic and international individuals and organizations interested in education, to establish various forms of schools.

The principle of "each generation surpassing the previous one" is the law of educational development. We must have a correct understanding and evaluation of our educational targets, especially college and high school students. In an environment of reform and openness, today's youth are a thinking generation, a generation seeking knowledge. Neither strict control nor laissez-faire approaches are appropriate. Traditional methods of political indoctrination and old-style political thought work are no longer effective. Therefore, we must explore new ways to conduct modern citizenship education.

Modern society is a society of modern large-scale production, a society establishing a new order of socialist commodity economy. Modern society is not a society of anarchy. The first duty of modern citizens is to obey the government's laws and act within legal boundaries. Market competition must also be legal. Therefore, it is urgent to establish modern citizenship consciousness throughout society, starting with students.

The content of modern citizenship consciousness is rich, including concepts and behaviors such as law-abiding, credibility, autonomy, democracy, equality, competition, cooperation, efficiency, and time management. Additionally, we must further promote the spirit of striving and dedicating oneself to ideals (goals), heroic bravery, and the noble character of working for the people and humanity. We know that the emergence of many outstanding talents is not only determined by the richness of knowledge but also by their good personality, emotions, will, and virtues.

The internationalization of education is a global trend. In today's world, economics, science, and culture are all interdependent and mutually beneficial. International educational exchanges and cooperation must be strengthened. Future education will undoubtedly be internationalized and education will be internationalized.

Historically, students who studied abroad have played a significant role in the fate of the nation. To achieve modernization, the policy for studying abroad should be more open, and better conditions should be created for them.

Strengthen educational scientific research. We must seriously analyze, absorb, and further innovate on new educational trends, schools of thought, teaching methods, educational tools, and equipment from around the world. Just as the economic front has produced a large number of entrepreneurs, the educational front must also have a large number of educators.

Educational system reforms must be conducted according to the laws and characteristics of education. Do not simply copy the reforms of enterprises. Issues such as the principal responsibility system, school organizational structure and management forms, salary systems, optimizing labor combinations, labor practice activities, and school-run enterprises should all be handled with caution. Avoid rushing into things, taking a one-size-fits-all approach, and making all schools the same.

The issue of educational funding. With such a large population and such a vast educational undertaking, relying solely on government financial allocations is insufficient. Historically, sponsoring education has been a noble cause. Using a phrase: "Those with money contribute money, those with strength contribute strength, those with people contribute people," if all enlightened individuals across the nation contribute to education, the future of education will be very bright.

The focus of education is the teacher problem. The teacher issue must be resolved urgently; otherwise, all educational strategies, policies, and guidelines will become empty talk. Without enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity from teachers, what hope is there for our education?

Currently, there are approximately 10 million primary and secondary school teachers in our country, educating over 200 million students. Their work is closely connected with every household in the nation. Currently, there are three main issues with teachers: salary, working conditions, and social status. More urgently, there are issues with salary, housing, and medical care. According to statistics from 1987, the average monthly salary for teachers is 120 yuan, which is 12.1% lower than other industries, ranking third from the bottom among 12 industries, making them the "old tenth." According to surveys, teachers also lag behind other industries in terms of income outside of their salary. How can teachers become a sacred and highly respected profession under such conditions?

Education has many aspects, but ultimately, the first step is to genuinely and seriously solve the practical difficulties faced by teachers, even if it means solving them one by one, point by point, and layer by layer.

### 对教育的几点认识与建议

　　对教育的几点认识与建议
　　童大林
    一、以和平与发展为主题的新的历史时代正在到来。不少国家的战略重点也开始转移到经济、科技与教育方面来了。在新的历史时代里，教育将成为各国在世界上生存、发展以至争雄的重要战略产业，教育将是决定人类未来命运的重要领域。
    当前，全国人民寄厚望于教育，要求教育真正成为立国之本与战略重点。这是一种热爱我们共和国、信任社会主义的强烈时代感。
    二、“教育要面向现代化，面向世界，面向未来”。小平同志为北京景山学校的这个题词，是发展我国教育的战略方向。
    我们社会主义教育的主要目标，应是培育现代化各行各业的人才，建立强大的知识劳动者大军，提高各民族的素质，为人类贡献众多的优秀、杰出的人物。
    三、教育是巨大的社会系统工程。在现代大经济（社会化大生产）与社会主义商品经济的条件下，必须形成一个新的完整的大教育体系：
    ——学校教育系统。即从幼儿园、小学、中学到大学，主要任务是进行基础知识教育。
    ——专业培训系统。即对各行各业的现职劳动者进行专业化的形式多样的培训。
    ——社会文化系统。为电视、广播、电影、书刊，以及博物馆、图书馆、文化馆等各种文化艺术活动。
    四、教育必须放开与开放，纠正长期以来那种高度集中的大一统的教育体制。教育是全社会的伟大事业。必须广开学路，让企业、乡镇、社区以及华侨、华裔和国内外热心教育的人士、团体，等等，都来兴办各种形式的学校。
    五、一代胜过一代，是教育的发展规律。对我们的教育对象，特别是大、中学生，要有正确的估计和评价。在改革、开放的环境中，当代青少年是思考的一代，求知的一代。对学生的“管、卡、压”或放任自流都是不对的，传统的“政治课”的灌输方式和老一套政治思想工作也已经不行了。因此，应该重新摸索如何进行现代公民教育的新路子。
    现代社会是现代大经济的社会，是建立社会主义商品经济新秩序的社会。现代社会绝不是无政府状态的社会。现代社会的公民第一条义务就是遵守政府的法令，在合法的范围内活动。市场竞争也必须是合法的竞争。因此，在全社会，首先在学生中树立现代公民意识成为当务之急了。
    现代公民意识的内容十分丰富，如守法、信誉、自主、民主、平等、竞争、合作、效率、时间，等等观点与行为。同时，要进一步提倡为理想（目标）而拚搏、献身的精神，见义勇为的英雄气概，为人民为人类而工作的高尚品格。我们知道，不少优秀人才的出现，不仅决定于知识的丰富，更重要的是他们具有良好的个性、感情、意志和美德。
    六、教育国际化是一股世界潮流。当代世界无论是经济、科技、文化都在互相影响、互相取长补短之中。国际间的教育交流与合作，必须大力加强。未来教育必定是教育国际化和国际化的教育。
    历史上，去国外深造的留学生曾对国家的命运起了相当大的作用。要实现现代化，留学生政策应更加开放，要为他们创造更好的留学条件。
    七、加强教育科学研究。对国际上兴起的新的教育思潮、教育学派、教学方法、教育手段、教育设备，等等，都要认真分析、吸收和进一步创造。正如经济战线出现大批企业家一样，教育战线上也必须有大批的教育家。
    八、教育体制改革，一定要按照教育规律和特点进行。不要照搬企业改革那一套。如校长负责制、学校组织机构和管理形式、工资制度，优化劳动组合，劳动实践活动，校办企业等等，都应慎重行事，切忌一哄而起，一刀切，千校一律。
    九、教育经费问题。我国人口这么多，这么庞大的教育事业，单靠政府财政拨款是难于胜任的。历史上，兴办教育是一种义举胜事。借用一句话：“有钱出钱，有力出力，有人出人”，众人拾柴火焰高，如果全国所有有识之士都来为教育做点事，教育就有非常光明的前景了。
    十、教育的焦点是教师问题。教师急需解决，问题不解决，什么教育的战略、方针、政策都会成为一大堆空话。教师没有热情，没有积极性、创造性，我们的教育还有什么希望呢？
    我国目前大中小学教师约有１０００多万，受教学生２亿多，他们的工作几乎和全国家家户户血肉相联。当前教师问题有三个：工资待遇、工作条件和社会地位。更紧迫一些的是：工资、住房和医疗。据１９８７年统计，教师月平均工资１２０元，比其他行业低１２．１％，在１２个行业中占倒数第３位，即“老十”。据调查，教师在工资外收入方面，与其他行业相比也明显地落在后面。这种状况怎能使教师成为神圣的最受人尊敬的职业呢？
    教育千条万条，归根到底，第一步是切切实实、认认真真地解决教师实际困难，即使是一个一个的、一点一点的、一层一层的加以解决也好。
