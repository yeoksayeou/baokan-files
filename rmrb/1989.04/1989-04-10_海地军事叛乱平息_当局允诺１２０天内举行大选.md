Haitian Military Rebellion Quelled; Authorities Promise Elections in 120 Days

		MEXICO CITY, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Haitian authorities announced tonight that the military rebellion, which had been ongoing for a week, has been suppressed. They also promised to hold elections within 120 days.

		According to reports from news media in Mexico City, the Caribbean island nation, which is the poorest in the Western Hemisphere, has been in a state of military rebellion since the failed coup attempt early last Sunday. For several days, the capital Port-au-Prince has been in chaos and gun battles. Schools have suspended classes, factories have halted production, and shops have closed. Transportation has been disrupted, telephone communications have been paralyzed, and there have been power outages and water shortages. Residents have been enduring hunger and fear, with the main streets of the capital littered with burning tires. Early on April 6, Avril issued an order at the government building for the rebel troops to cease resistance, but this was rejected. The diplomatic missions stationed in Haiti had attempted to mediate between the two sides to resolve the dispute peacefully, but these efforts were unsuccessful. On Friday night (April 7), troops loyal to the current government launched an attack on the rebel troops, retaking one by one the positions occupied by the rebels, including the radio station and a barracks adjacent to Avril's residential garden. Sporadic gun battles continued for 18 hours until Saturday evening (April 8), when the authorities announced that the week-long rebellion had been suppressed.

　　海地军事叛乱平息
    当局允诺１２０天内举行大选
    本报墨西哥城４月８日电记者郭伟成报道：海地当局今天晚上表示，持续一周的军事叛乱已平息，并允诺在１２０天内举行大选。
    据墨西哥城新闻媒介报道：西半球最贫困的这个加勒比岛国，自从上星期日凌晨发生未遂政变以来，一直处于军事叛乱中。数日来，海地首都太子港陷入混乱与枪战。学校停课、工厂停工、商店停业；交通中断、电话通讯瘫痪，停电、停水，居民忍饥受惊，首都主要街道布上了燃烧的轮胎。４月６日凌晨，阿夫里尔在政府大厦通令叛乱部队停止对抗，但是，遭到拒绝。驻海地的外交使团曾试图向双方斡旋，和平解决争执，但是没有成功。星期五（４月７日）夜间，忠于现政权的部队向叛乱部队发起进攻，逐一收回叛乱部队占领的据点，包括广播电台，以及紧挨阿夫里尔住宅花园的一座兵营。零星的枪战持续了１８个小时，直到星期六（４月８日）晚上，当局宣布，持续一周的叛乱已被平息。
