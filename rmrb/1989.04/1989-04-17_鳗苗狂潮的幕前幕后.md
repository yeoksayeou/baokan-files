The eel, also known as the "white eel," spawns in the deep sea in autumn, and the young eels migrate into freshwater in early spring to grow. The meat is tender and nutritious, making it a high-quality food fish. No one expected that the eel fry, as thin as silk threads, would cause such a massive "tidal wave."

The Front and Backstage of the Eel Fry Craze

Reporter: Jiang Yapin

The battle is on again. The price of eel fry has skyrocketed. Tens of thousands of boats are engaged in reckless fishing, causing the Yangtze River to be temporarily blocked.

During the day, the sky is dark with boats, and at night, the river is lit up with countless lights. Tens of thousands of boats of various colors and tens of thousands of excited fishermen gather at the mouth of the Yangtze River. The beams of light sweep across the water, and eyes are sharp. Nets made of mosquito netting are repeatedly "sweeping" the river water, and the prey is the eel fry as thin as silk threads.

The value of eel fry has soared like a kite with a broken string: last year, 1 kilogram was worth about 10,000 yuan, which was astonishing. This spring, it has soared to 18,000 or even 20,000 yuan. Whoever has a small plastic bag of eel fry becomes a "millionaire." And catching this bag of eel fry sometimes takes only one night.

Thus, students skip classes, workers stop working, farmers stop farming, fishermen stop fishing, and officials stop working, all rushing to the mouth of the Yangtze River. Thus, there are all kinds of strange and bizarre smugglers: eel fry is carefully hidden in coffins, oil drums, thermos bottles, down jackets, car tires, military planes, and even stuffed into women's underwear. Driven by money, boats collide, and crowds are entangled. In the eel fry fishing season last year alone, Jiangsu Province had 121 people die for eel fry.

Reckless fishing has severely damaged eel fry resources; smuggling is rampant, and resources are flowing out in large quantities, threatening the domestic eel farming industry, which has already invested heavily and has high hopes. In this situation, people are concerned about how the relevant departments are thinking and what they are doing?

All the departments involved are worried. But whose responsibility is it? Who can control it? It's really a tangled mess...

What is presented to the reporter is a chain of causes and effects that are interconnected, cannot be cut, and are even more tangled.

The first link: Fisheries administration. Officials from the Fisheries Administration of the Ministry of Agriculture told the reporter: they have done their best. Last year, to manage the eel fry, Jiangsu Province alone mobilized more than 5,000 people. However, due to limited funds and outdated equipment, illegal boats often run ahead, and fisheries administration boats chase behind, resulting in the gap widening. Even if they catch up, the illegal fishermen are not afraid of fines. A fine of 200 yuan is nothing; they just bring 600 yuan to prepare for three fines. As long as they catch one, the money is not lost.

They believe that to solve the eel fry problem, the management system must be straightened out, and the excessive demand for eel fry must be strictly controlled. Once the price drops, the frenzy of overfishing will subside.

The second link: Aquaculture. The Aquaculture Department of the Ministry of Agriculture has been vigorously supporting the domestic eel farming industry in recent years. Their view is that exporting eels is more economically beneficial and has a higher foreign exchange earning rate than exporting eel fry. The current "eel fry war" is caused by the price surge due to excessive demand for fry. This cannot be blamed on the development of the eel farming industry at home. Apart from some smuggling, the main reason is that the foreign trade department only cares about immediate interests and exports too much.

The third link: Foreign trade. The foreign trade department defends itself: "The eel fry war" is mainly due to rampant smuggling. In the long run, increasing the farming and export of eels is the direction, but at present, some eel fry should be exported appropriately. The domestic eel farming industry has developed rapidly in recent years, and overall, it is a good thing, but some of it is also blind. They counter-question: at present, most of the eel feed needs to be imported, and we are controlled by others. The market for exporting eels is also concentrated in Japan. What if the market fluctuates?

The fourth link: Customs. Customs officials do not avoid the fact of large-scale eel fry smuggling and the ineffectiveness of customs enforcement. But the reality is that the anti-smuggling forces of the whole country are mainly concentrated at the cargo and passenger inspection ports. The eel fry smuggling season is strong, there is no special anti-smuggling department, and moreover, the eel fry smuggling targets are very small, many of them are caught in the water and walked on the water, and some even smuggle collectively, with the party secretary and team leader all participating, making it difficult to discover. The anti-smuggling officials are more frank: the eel problem is mainly because the fisheries administration, aquaculture, and foreign trade departments have their own interests and act independently. Expecting the customs to control it alone seems unrealistic, and comprehensive governance is needed.

After a round of interviews, the reporter returned to the starting point. All the parties involved have their own reasons, are worried, and are making efforts, but it seems that no one has clearly stated who is responsible, who can control it, and who is not willing to do more.

Is it necessary to blame the eel: why did you prefer China's rivers, lakes, and seas, and give birth to such a valuable body?

Behind the frenzied fishing is the collision and struggle of different interests between departments and between places.

In fact, the eel fry, as thick as matchsticks, shocked China's highest leadership three years ago. In 1984, the domestic purchase price of eel fry was only about 500 yuan per kilogram; in 1986, it reached nearly 5,000 yuan. The high price caused reckless fishing and also increased the pressure on the domestic eel farming industry, which had just started.

For this reason, the aquaculture department strongly demanded to reduce the foreign trade export plan, and the eel fry should mainly be supplied to the domestic eel farming. The foreign trade department, however, believed that exporting some eel fry would not affect domestic farming, and it would be a pity to give up the easy foreign exchange. Both sides were unwilling to compromise and did their own thing. This matter attracted the attention of the then State Council leaders, and the relevant departments specially convened a meeting to coordinate with all parties. Finally, several "gentlemen's agreements" were formally made: the export quantity of eel fry should be gradually reduced year by year; the annual export quantity of eel fry should be jointly decided and issued by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Foreign Trade; the state should regulate the highest purchase price of eel fry, and the specific price should be jointly decided by the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and the State Price Bureau.

According to the aquaculture department, these "agreements" were not implemented. In 1987, the eel fry was abundant, and the price was sluggish, and the war did not break out. In the past two years, the fry source was again tight, and the price soared. During this period, the foreign trade department did not reduce the export quantity, and the plan was not discussed with the Ministry of Agriculture. The price was still decided by itself. In December last year, the foreign trade department notified various places of the highest limit price for 1989 as 13,000 yuan per kilogram by urgent telegram. The aquaculture department believed that this notice was not discussed and that the price was too high, which would cause a new war and seriously impact the domestic eel farming industry. It immediately submitted an emergency report to the State Council and notified the relevant provincial and municipal aquaculture departments that the highest limit price issued by the foreign trade department unilaterally was invalid.

The foreign trade department did not accept this accusation. Relevant personnel told the reporter that although the annual export procurement plan has not been reduced and has not increased significantly, it has already stopped exporting eel fry from Guangdong and Fujian, which have strong eel farming capabilities. The export plan can be discussed, but it should be issued by the foreign trade department, which is responsible for the foreign exchange earning task.

The focal point of the dispute between the two sides remains: under the current conditions, is it to export more eel fry to earn foreign exchange directly? Or to use more eel fry to farm and export eels to earn foreign exchange? This contradiction has become more complicated since various provinces began to implement the foreign exchange contract responsibility system last year.

Guangdong and Fujian have superior eel farming conditions, low costs, and have developed early and have large scales. Moreover, because eel fry smuggling is rampant in the local area, the supply of eel fry is insufficient. Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu have abundant eel fry resources. For this reason, Guangdong and Fujian have repeatedly requested the transfer of eel fry from Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. From the perspective of domestic resource allocation, this is not a bad choice.

But Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai responded coldly. Locally produced eel fry, locally farmed, if there is a surplus, it can be directly exported, and the foreign exchange is all theirs. Giving it to other provinces is like "wasting good water." Negotiations failed, and they could not let a large number of high-investment eel ponds be idle, so Guangdong and Fujian sent a large number of procurement personnel northward, and it is said that Fujian alone had 5,000 people. Procurement personnel, smugglers, and local residents are mixed together, and the fisheries administration and industrial and commercial departments are very headache.

The defects of the management system are also particularly prominent under the pressure of various economic interests. Eel fry is a common resource. For this resource, most countries and regions have vertical management of fisheries, while China is under the unified leadership of the state and the management of local levels. Under this system, the resource belongs to the state, the management belongs to the local, and the profit belongs to oneself. The eel fry swims without borders, and if you don't catch it, it's a waste.

Obviously, under the current system, relying solely on administrative measures and emphasizing the "overall situation" to coordinate the economic interests of departments and departments, departments and places, and places and places, and to manage the increasingly strained common resources, is already difficult to achieve.

Just as the reporter was busy with the interviews, a new regulation from Japan's Ministry of Health came: due to the discovery of a substance called "silicate" in the live eels imported from China, all live eels from the mainland and Hong Kong (which is also a transit point for the mainland) will be strictly inspected by the customs for three days starting from late February.

Live eels will die if they are detained at the customs for three days waiting for inspection. Relevant personnel believe that the Japanese side's decision is equivalent to announcing the suspension of the import of live eels from the mainland.

The reporter does not dare to speculate on whether there is a more complex and deeper background to the Japanese side's new regulation. Regardless of the cause, the seriousness of the problem lies in the fact that by 1988, China's eel farming pond area and greenhouse area have reached a considerable scale. Japan, which is almost the only importer of live eels, has suddenly come up with a trick. What should we do?

In this resource war and trade war involving interests, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan Province not only have flexible information feedback and decision-making systems but also have established specialized organizations to coordinate the production, supply, and sales of eels in their own countries and regions. Enterprises have internal competition and often coordinate to act in unison against external forces.

Facing this rapidly changing and highly organized international market, we are like a loose sand. The suggestion to establish a national eel association that transcends departmental and local interests has been brewing for several years but has not yet been realized. Due to the division of interests, each acting on its own, until now, there is no relatively accurate and consistent answer to some of the most basic situations. For example, the annual resource quantity of eel fry in China, the market capacity of eels in the international market, the scientific comparison of the cost and benefit of exporting eel fry and exporting eels, the current technical level of eel farming in the mainland, and some basic data and judgments, the views and conclusions of various departments are far apart, and some even cannot be clearly stated. Recently, a coordination group on the eel problem under the foreign trade system has been established by a certain chamber of commerce, although this is a welcome signal, but this coordination is still limited within the department.

The reporter does not intend to paint a bleak picture of solving the eel fry problem, but the current situation is indeed worthy of high vigilance. Some people are concerned that the new regulation of the Japanese Ministry of Health will severely damage or even destroy China's heavily invested eel farming industry. Some people worry that year after year of reckless fishing will cause China's precious eel resources to suffer the same fate as the cod and large and small yellow croakers, facing annihilation.

### 鳗苗狂潮的幕前幕后

专栏：

    鳗，亦称“白鳗”，亲鱼于秋季降入深海产卵，幼鱼初春游入淡水生长；肉质细嫩，营养丰富，为上等食用鱼。谁也没料到，细若游丝的鳗苗竟会掀起阵阵“滔天巨浪”
　　鳗苗狂潮的幕前幕后
    本报记者　蒋亚平
    　　　　大战再起。鳗苗价疯涨。数万条船狂捕滥捞，浩浩长江一时为之堵塞
    白天黑压压一团，入夜亮灿灿一片，数万条各色船舶，十数万情绪亢奋的捕捞者，蜂拥在长江口一带，灯柱横扫，眼光炯炯。用蚊帐布做成的密网翻来复去“篾”着江水，猎物是一条条细如游丝的鳗苗。
    鳗苗身价升腾真如风筝断了线：去年１公斤价值１万元左右，这已令人瞠目。今春竟呼啦啦窜到１．８万、２万元。谁只需拥有一小塑料袋鳗鱼苗，就成为一个“万元户”。而捞取这袋鳗苗，有时只在一夜之间。
    于是，学生不上课，工人不做工，农民不种地，渔民不下海，干部不上班，都拥向了长江口。于是，有了种种离奇古怪的倒卖、走私者：鳗苗被精心藏进棺材、油桶、热水瓶、羽绒服、汽车轮胎、军用飞机，甚至被塞进妇女贴身衣裤。在金钱的驱动下，船群在碰撞，人流在绞杀。仅在去年鳗苗捕捞季节，江苏省就有１２１人为鳗苗而丧生。
    狂捕滥捞，使鳗苗资源遭到严重破坏；走私猖獗，资源大量外流，又危及到国内已经大量投资并寄望甚厚的成鳗养殖业。此情此景，人们关心的是，有关部门怎样在想？又做了些什么？
    　　　　所涉部门，都在忧虑。但责任在谁？谁能管得住？真是剪不断，理还乱……
    展现在记者面前的，是一条首尾相连、剪不断、理还乱的因果链。
    第一环：渔政。农业部渔政司有关官员告诉记者：他们已尽了全力。去年为管好鳗苗，光江苏就动了５０００多人。但是由于经费少，装备陈旧，经常是违法船只前面跑，渔政船只后面追，结果越追隔得越远。既便追上，违法者也不怕罚，一次罚２００元，干脆带上６００元，准备罚３次，只要捞着一次，钱就少赚不了。
    他们认为，解决鳗苗问题，必须理顺上下脱节的管理体制，严格控制对鳗苗的过度需求。价格下跌，滥捕狂潮自会平息。
    第二环：水产。农业部水产司近年一直在大力扶持国内成鳗养殖业。他们的看法是，出口成鳗比出口鳗苗有更高的经济效益和创汇率。目前的“鳗苗大战”，源于对苗源过度需求造成的价格飞涨，这不能责怪国内发展养鳗业，除有部分走私外，主要是外贸部门只顾眼前利益，出口太多。
    第三环：外贸。外贸部门对此声辩：“鳗苗大战”，主要因为走私猖獗。从长远看，多养殖成鳗出口是个方向，但目前应当适当出口一些鳗苗。国内近几年成鳗养殖业急剧发展，总的看来是好事，但有的也带有盲目性。他们反问：目前养鳗饲料大部分需要进口，受制于人。成鳗出口市场，又单一集中在日本。万一市场波动，怎么办？
    第四环：海关。海关官员并不回避大量鳗苗走私和海关打击不力的事实。但现状是，全国反走私力量主要集中在货检、旅检关口。鳗苗走私季节性强，没有专门查私部门，而且，鳗苗走私，目标甚小，许多是水中捞，水上走，有的干脆集体走私，支书、队长齐上阵，很难发现。缉私处官员更直率：鳗鱼成为问题，主要是因为渔政、水产、外贸自有利益，各自为政。指望海关一家管住，似不现实，必须综合治理。
    一圈采访，记者步回原地。所涉各家，自持其理，都在忧虑，都在出力，但似乎谁也没说清楚，谁也没有责任，谁也管不了，谁也不愿多管。
    难道要责怪鳗鱼：谁叫你偏爱中国的江海湖河，又生了那么一个值钱身？！
    　　　　狂捞滥捕的背后，是部门与部门、地方与地方不同利益的磕碰和混战
    其实，火柴棒大小的鳗苗，３年前就惊动过中国的最高领导。１９８４年，国内鳗苗收购价每公斤仅５００元左右；１９８６年，竟逼近５０００元。高昂的价格，激起了狂捕滥捞，也给国内刚起步的成鳗养殖业增加了压力。
    为此，水产部门强烈要求削减外贸出口计划，鳗苗主要供给国内养殖成鳗。外贸部门则认为，出口一部分鳗苗并不影响国内养殖，唾手可得的外汇不要，太可惜。双方各不相让，各行其事。此事引起当时国务院领导的重视，有关部门专门召集各方协商，最后正式订下几条“君子协议”：鳗苗出口数量逐年递减；每年出口鳗苗数量由农业部和经贸部商定共同下达；鳗苗由国家规定最高收购价，具体价格由农业部、经贸部、国家物价局商定。
    据水产部门反映，这些“协议”并未执行。１９８７年，鳗苗丰产，价格疲软，战事未起。去今两年，苗源再度告紧，价格飞涨。这期间，外贸部门出口数量没减，下达计划也未与农业部商量，价格仍是自家独定。去年１２月，外贸部门以特急电报通知各地１９８９年最高限价为１公斤１．３万元。水产部门认为此通知没经过协商，而且定价太高，会引起新的大战，并严重打击国内成鳗养殖业，即向国务院递上紧急报告，并电告有关省市水产部门，外贸单方下达的最高限价无效。
    外贸部门对此指责没有接受。有关人士告诉记者，每年出口收购计划，虽未减少，也没大的增加，并且已经停止从成鳗养殖力量雄厚的广东、福建出口鳗苗。出口计划，协商是可以的，但是理应由承担创汇任务的外贸部门下达。
    两家争执的焦点依然是：在目前条件下，是多出口鳗苗直接创汇？还是用鳗苗多养成鳗出口创汇？这一矛盾，因各省从去年开始实行创汇包干，变得更为复杂。
    广东、福建养鳗条件优越，成本低，本来发展早，规模大，又因为当地鳗苗走私甚多，鳗苗供给不足。上海、浙江、江苏鳗苗资源丰富。为此，粤、闽方面多次要求从沪、苏、浙调运鳗苗。这从国内资源配置看，不失为最佳选择。
    但江、浙、沪反应冷淡。自产鳗苗，就地养殖，若有剩余直接出口，外汇全归自己。给了外省，等于“肥水外流”。
    协商不成，又不能眼看着大批高投资的鳗池赋闲，于是广东、福建大批采购人员北上，据说仅福建就有５０００之众。采购员、走私者同当地百姓混在一起，渔政、工商部门十分头疼。
    管理体制的缺陷，也在各种经济利益的挤压下，显得格外突出。鳗苗是一种共有性资源，对这种资源，绝大多数国家和地区的渔政都是垂直管理，而我国是国家统一领导，地方分级管理。这种体制下，资源是国家的，管理是地方的，发财是自己的。鳗苗游，无疆界，不捕白不捕。
    显然，在现有体制下，光靠行政手段和仅强调“全局观念”，来协调部门与部门、部门与地方、地方与地方的经济利益，来管理日见窘迫的共有性资源，已经很难奏效。
    　　　　日本国的新规定带来冲击。面对瞬息万变而又高度组织的国际市场，我们何时才不再是一盘散沙
    正当记者忙于采访时，东邻日本国厚生省传来一个新规定：因在从中国进口的活成鳗中，发现了一种被称为“硅酸盐”的“药物残留物”，自２月下旬起，凡由大陆和香港（也是大陆转口）到日本的活成鳗，都必须在海关进行为期３天的严格检查。
    活鳗滞关三天等候检验，恐怕都要魂归西天。有关人士认为，日方这项决定，实际等于宣布停止从大陆进口活成鳗。
    日方这个新规定有没有更复杂、更深层的背景，记者不敢妄断。不论起因如何，问题的严峻性在于，至１９８８年，我国鳗鱼养殖池面积和温室面积已经达到相当规模。几乎是唯一活成鳗进口国的日本却突出奇招，我们怎么办？
    在这种利益攸关的资源战和贸易战中，日本和南朝鲜、我国台湾省，不仅有着灵活的信息反馈和决策系统，而且都成立有专门协调本国、本地区鳗鱼产供销关系的行业联合组织。各企业既有内部竞争，也经常协调行动一致对外。
    面对这瞬息万变而又高度组织化的国际市场，我们则如一盘散沙。有关成立超脱部门、地方利益的全国鳗鱼联合协会的建议，酝酿数年，至今难产。由于利益分割，各自为政，至今对一些最基本的情况都没有较确切一致的答案。如我国鳗苗年资源量，成鳗国际市场容量，出口鳗苗和出口成鳗的成本及效益的科学比较，大陆现有养鳗技术水平程度等一些基本的数据和判断，各部门的看法和结论都相去甚远，有的甚至谁也说不清楚。最近，属于外贸系统的某商会已成立一个关于鳗鱼问题的协调小组，尽管这是一个可喜的讯号，但是，这种协调仍只局限在本部门以内。
    记者无意对解决鳗苗问题描绘一个暗淡的前景，但眼前的情势确实值得高度警惕。有人担心，日本厚生省的新规定，会重创甚至摧毁我国投资甚巨的成鳗养殖业。有人忧虑，年复一年的狂捕滥捞，会使我国宝贵的鳗鱼资源重蹈带鱼、大小黄鱼之覆辙，遭到灭顶之灾。
