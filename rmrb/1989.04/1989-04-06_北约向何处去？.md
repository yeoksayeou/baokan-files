The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has just celebrated its 40th anniversary. This military alliance, established after World War II, is now grappling with how to adapt to the changing global landscape.

As the primary military bloc of the West, NATO emerged in the context of the post-war Cold War and the U.S.-Soviet rivalry for global dominance. Its most notable feature was the use of collective military force to "contain communism" in the European socialist camp. At that time, Western European countries were significantly weakened after the war, so the United States took on the primary responsibility for defense in Western Europe. Forty years later, East-West relations and the European situation have undergone tremendous changes. The bipolar world is evolving into a multipolar one. With the strengthening of Western Europe's economic and political power, the relationship between Europe and the United States is no longer as harmonious as before. Moreover, the positions and interests of allies on both sides of the Atlantic often differ, leading to conflicts and making it difficult to reach consensus. Western Europe hopes to strengthen its position within NATO and end the situation where it is subordinate to others in defense matters as soon as possible. At the same time, it is concerned about a "decoupling" of U.S.-European defense. The United States wants to reduce its defense burden in Europe but does not want to give up its role as the "protector of Europe." Thus, NATO finds itself in a "crisis period" where it needs to adjust internal relations without completely breaking the existing structure.

Additionally, with the easing of tensions between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, NATO needs to adjust its strategy towards the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. The strategies formulated in the 1960s, such as the "forward strategy" and "nuclear threshold," no longer fit the current situation. As a result, there are a series of debates within NATO, including disagreements over the "comprehensive concept" for Eastern strategy, whether to update short-range nuclear weapons, and differing views on Gorbachev's proposal for a "European house." Reaching a consensus on these issues will require a long and possibly painful process of consultation and coordination between the U.S. and Europe.

In summary, the new global situation poses a "severe challenge" to NATO. A U.S. analyst on East-West relations predicts that 1989 will be a "dangerous year" for NATO. Clearly, NATO, at this turning point, urgently needs to adjust its internal relations and strategy towards the Soviet Union.

Looking at the current situation, as NATO adjusts its internal and external strategies, it will gradually downplay its military organization image and strive to demonstrate its role in "solidifying Western unity" in the political, economic, and social domains. NATO will explore a path for continued survival and progress amid ongoing debates and coordination. In this ongoing transformation, the stance of the Federal Republic of Germany is crucial. Its actions will significantly influence the process of East-West European integration and the fate of NATO.

On April 19-20, the NATO Nuclear Planning Group will hold a meeting. At the end of next month, the NATO summit will also be held in Brussels. These two meetings will provide a glimpse into how NATO will proceed in its adjustments.

### 北约向何处去？

　　北约向何处去？
    本报记者  魏崴
    北大西洋公约组织刚刚庆祝了它成立４０周年纪念日，这个于二次大战结束后建立的军事集团，正在为能否适应当前变化了的世界局势而煞费脑筋。
    作为西方主要的军事集团，北约是在战后冷战的形势下，在美苏争霸世界的格局中应运而生的。它的一个显著特征是为对付当时欧洲的社会主义阵营，以所谓集团军事力量“遏制共产主义”。由于那时西欧各国战后力量大大削弱，因此由美国在西欧防务中承担主要责任。４０年后的今天，东西方关系和欧洲形势发生了巨大的变化，两极世界日益向多极世界演化，随着西欧的经济、政治力量的增强，欧美之间的关系就不像过去那样一致，加之大西洋两岸盟友的地位和利益不尽相同，常常出现矛盾，难以形成共识。西欧希望加强自己在北约的地位，早日结束在防务上听命于他人的格局，但同时又担心美欧防务“脱钩”，美国希望减少对欧洲的防务负担，却又不想放弃“欧洲保护者”的角色。这样，北约就处在一个又要调整内部关系，又不想完全打破现有格局的“危机时期”。
    此外，由于北约和华约两大军事集团对峙的紧张局势有所缓和，北约需要调整对苏联和东欧国家的战略。６０年代制定的那套什么“前沿战略”、“核门槛”设想等等已不适应今天的形势，于是在北约内部出现了一系列的争论，有对东方战略的“整体构想”之争，要不要更新短程核武器之争，以及对戈尔巴乔夫提出的“欧洲大厦”的认识之争。美欧在上述争端上要想达成一致，需要一个长期的、甚至是痛苦的磋商、协调过程。
    总之，世界新形势对北约构成了“严峻的挑战”。一位美国东西方问题分析家预言，１９８９年对北约是“危险的一年”。足可见处在转折时期的北约，调整内部关系和对苏策略已是迫在眉睫的事了。
    从当前形势来看，北约在调整内外战略的同时，将逐渐淡化其军事组织的形象，而在政治、经济和社会等领域努力显示它“巩固西方团结”的作用。北约将在不断争吵和协调中，探索一条继续生存、继续前进的道路。在目前的这场转变中，联邦德国的立场举足轻重，它如何动作，将在很大程度上决定东西欧联合的进程和北约的命运。
    本月１９日—２０日，北约核计划小组将举行会议，下月月底，北约首脑会议也将在布鲁塞尔召开。这两个会议之后，北约在调整中如何迈步，可见端倪。
