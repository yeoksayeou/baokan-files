Title: On the Issue of Police Cars Leading the Way

During the Spring Festival, a professor who serves as a consultant to the judicial department came to visit me. As I was seeing him off, a convoy led by police cars happened to pass by, sirens blaring. The professor smiled and said, "That's just for show." I asked him why he thought so. He said that last month, when he went to a certain place, the local authorities also dispatched police cars to lead the way for them. I asked if there were any "important figures" among them. "Not at all," he laughed, "There were only three of us, all like me."

I recalled the scene from last year when I attended an economic discussion in a mountainous area. After the meeting, we were invited to visit nine counties and cities. Along the way, police cars led the convoy. The car at the front had a rotating red light and a blaring siren. A police officer held a small red flag out of the window, waving it vigorously at oncoming vehicles and shouting, "Stop! Let the convoy pass, then you can go!"

Seeing such things frequently, one gets used to them. It's like being in a room filled with fragrant orchids or living in a place with plenty of seafood; after a while, you no longer notice the scent or the smell.

However, sometimes a gust of fresh air can restore your sense of smell. One day, during a break from work, I casually flipped through some pages and came across an article written by an important figure from a developed country recalling his visit to China. He mentioned that when their convoy passed through the streets of B city, police cars led the way, and thousands of residents were kept far away on both sides of the road, forming a human barrier that cut off traffic. "The scene was quite terrifying!" Why was it terrifying? Because such a sight was unimaginable in their country. The common people are taxpayers, and officials are "servants," supported by the taxes paid by the people. How could the masters give way to the "servants"?

What different views on the same thing! To some, it seems very "impressive" and "glorious"; to others, it seems very frightening and uncivilized.

Of course, some might say that their system is "fake democracy," that they have seized so many means of production for themselves, turning them into capital for exploiting surplus value. In matters like walking, they just do a bit of trickery to "deceive" and "alleviate" contradictions. We are all familiar with this kind of analysis. But I still want to say that whether it's true democracy or fake democracy, officials should, as much as possible, not disrupt the normal lives of the people and not add to their burdens when conducting various activities.

In recent years, the streets of Beijing no longer see the scenes from a few years ago where traffic was cut off dozens of minutes in advance, preventing people from crossing the road. This is progress. Occasionally, there are still convoys led by police cars, but they are mostly to ensure that diplomatic vehicles are not blocked, so that official business can proceed on time. Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong recently handed over his police car, which is commendable. However, in some places outside Beijing, there are still instances where police cars are used just to show "respect" and "importance" to "internal guests" and "visitors from above," or simply to show off authority and status, easily reminding one of the scenes from old operas with "drums leading the way," "silence," and "avoidance."

The misuse of police cars also has its advantages. Their blaring sirens can make us clearly see: although we indeed have the subjective desire to build a more democratic and free society than capitalism (doesn't the Communist Manifesto say, "The free development of each is the condition for the free development of all"?), we cannot escape a historical reality. This reality is that our socialism did not emerge from a capitalist society, much less a developed capitalist society, but from a feudal society that has lasted for thousands of years. Therefore, we still carry too many "feudal marks." These "marks" are still serious obstacles to our construction of a modern political, economic, and cultural system.

　　警车开道之议
　　官伟勋
    春节期间，一位任某司法部门顾问的教授来看我。送他出门时，恰好有一队由警车开路的车队唿哨而过。教授笑了笑说：“这玩意儿，有些纯粹是唬人的。”我问何以见得？他说他上个月去某地，当地有关部门也派警车给他们开路。我问他们当中是不是有什么“要人？”“哪里，”他笑道：“我们一共三个人，都是我这号的。”
    我想起了去年在某地参加山区经济讨论会的情景。会后，请与会同志参观九个县市时，一路上也是警车开路。跑在最前头的警车，红灯旋转，警笛刺耳长鸣，一位穿警服的同志手执一面红色小旗伸出车窗外，见了车辆就猛挥小旗喝道：“停下！车队过去再开！”
    诸如此类的事看多了，也就习惯了。像久处芝兰之室或久居鲍鱼之肆一样，闻久了，也就不觉香臭了。
    然而，有时遇上一阵清风，失去的嗅觉辨味力，忽又会恢复过来。有一天，工作之余“随便翻翻”，忽而翻到一发达国家一位要人写来华访问的回忆文章。其中说到在Ｂ市街头，当他们的车队通过时，警车开道，成千上万的居民被远远地阻在马路两侧，形成一道人墙，断绝了交通，“那场面十分可怕”！为什么会感到可怕呢？因为这种景象在他们国家是不能想象的。老百姓是纳税人，官员是“公仆”，是由老百姓的税金养活的。怎么能让主人给“仆人”让路呢？
    对于同一事物看法是如此不同！在有些人看来是很“气派”很“光采”的事；在另一些人看来，竟是很可怕很不文明的事。
    当然，会有人说，他们那一套是“假民主”，那末多的生产资料都攫为己有，变成剥削剩余价值的资本，在走路之类的小问题上搞点小动作，不过是为了“欺骗”，为了“缓和”矛盾罢了。对于这类分析我们都是很熟悉的。但我还是要说，不管是真民主也好，假民主也罢，官员们在进行各种活动时，尽可能不干扰老百姓的正常生活，不增加老百姓的额外负担，还是很有必要的。
    这些年来，在北京街头已经看不到若干年前那样，动不动就提前几十分钟断绝交通，禁止人们穿过马路的场面了。这是个进步。时而也有警车开路的车队通过，但大都以保证国宾车辆不被堵塞，以便按时进行国务活动为限。北京市长陈希同不久前将他的警车交出来，这值得称赞。但在外地的某些地方，至今还有仅仅为了表示对“内宾”，对“上边来的人”的“尊敬”与“重视”，甚至完全出于抖威风摆官架子便动不动动用警车开道的现象，很容易使人联想到旧戏上的“鸣锣开道”、“肃静”、“回避”的场面。
    警车乱用，也有个好处。它那长鸣的笛声可以使我们清醒地看到：尽管我们确有建设比资本主义更民主更自由的主观愿望（《共产党宣言》中不还说：“每个人的自由发展是一切人的自由发展的条件”吗？），但我们却无法摆脱一个历史实际。这个实际就是：我们的社会主义毕竟不是脱胎于资本主义社会，更不是脱胎于发达的资本主义社会，而是脱胎于千百年的封建社会。因此，在我们身上就遗留了太多的封建主义的“胎记”。这些“胎记”，至今还是我们建设现代化政治、经济、文化的严重拖累。
