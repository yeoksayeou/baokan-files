Title: **Xie Bingxing Remembers Her Homeland**

Edition: 8

The renowned female writer Xie Bingxing, who emerged after the May Fourth Movement, was my classmate in the fifth class of the Women's Brigade at the Whampoa Military Academy.

In 1927, our Women's Brigade, along with the male students, marched westward to suppress the rebellious armies of Xia Douyin and Yang Sen. Xie often seized the opportunity to sit on the ground, placing her lunch box or some hard object on her knees to write her "Diary of a Soldier," which she then sent to the "Supplementary Section" of the "Central Daily News" edited by Mr. Sun Fuyuan in Hankou. Later, the "Diary of a Soldier" was compiled and published, and translated into several languages, having a significant impact at the time. Now, this "Diary of a Soldier" and the "Selected Works of Xie Bingxing" have been reprinted on the mainland. Everyone is concerned about Xie Bingxing's recent situation. Recently, I received a letter from her overseas, and I would like to briefly introduce her situation to the readers who care about Xie Bingxing.

Xie went to Taiwan Normal College (later renamed Taiwan Normal University) to teach in 1948 and later moved to the United States, settling in San Francisco. Her husband, Professor Jia, passed away last July. In her old age, she feels doubly sad and lonely after losing her spouse. She suffers from eye disease and hand pain, and has only recently begun to write to her friends. Due to the long-term torment of her eye disease, she has changed from watching television to listening to it, but she still insists on writing a few lines in her diary every day.

In her letter, she mentioned that she really wants to return to her homeland to see her old friends and family.

She wrote with deep emotion: "The past seems like a dream. Back then, everyone was full of vigor. Now, although the world has changed greatly, we are still alive and can communicate, which is unexpected."

Xie asked me to convey her greetings to her former seniors, friends, and readers, and to share her recent situation and her long-standing longing for her homeland with everyone.

　　谢冰莹思念故国家园
    黄静汶
    “五四”以后的著名女作家谢冰莹是我在黄埔军校五期女生队同学。
    １９２７年我们女生队跟男同学一道西征，讨伐夏斗寅、杨森叛军时，她常抓紧时间席地而坐，把饭盒或什么硬东西搁在膝盖上执笔写《从军日记》，然后寄往汉口《中央日报》孙伏园先生编的副刊。后来《从军日记》编印出版，并译成多种文字，当时影响甚大。现在，这本《从军日记》以及《谢冰莹选集》已在大陆再版。关于谢冰莹的近况大家很关心，日前我接到她从海外来信，特简要介绍，以飨关心冰莹的读者。
    冰莹１９４８年去台湾师范学院（后改师大）执教，后旅居美国，定居旧金山。她的丈夫贾教授去年７月病故。老年丧偶，倍感悲痛孤独。她患眼疾、手痛，最近才开始给朋友们写信。由于眼疾长期折磨，她已把看电视改为听电视，但仍坚持每天写几行日记。
    她在信上说，很想回祖国来看看老朋友和家人。
    她无限感慨地写道：“过去像一场梦，当年谁也像生龙活虎。如今虽然世界大变，但我们还活着，能通信，也是想不到的。”
    冰莹嘱托我，向当年的学长、朋友和广大读者问好，并把她的近况和长期思念故国家园之情告诉大家。
