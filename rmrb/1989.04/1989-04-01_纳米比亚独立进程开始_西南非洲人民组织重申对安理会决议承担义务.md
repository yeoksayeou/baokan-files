The independence process for Namibia begins. The South West Africa People's Organization reaffirms its commitment to the UN Security Council resolution.

	NEW YORK, March 30 (Xinhua) — The South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) today reaffirmed its commitment to the United Nations Security Council Resolution 435, which is set to be implemented starting April 1.

	SWAPO Acting Chairman Daniel Tjongarero said at a press conference in Windhoek today that SWAPO values the peaceful resolution of conflicts, and its armed struggle is merely a response to specific situations. He called on the people of Namibia to take on the responsibility for peace.

	Tjongarero welcomed the arrival of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in Namibia, stating that this would help in the peaceful and stable implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 435.

	When discussing the relationship between South Africa and an independent Namibia, Tjongarero stated that it would be a relationship between sovereign nations, with no special ties.

	Tjongarero also ruled out the possibility of the independent Namibian government allowing the African National Congress (ANC) to establish military bases on its territory.

	Regarding the issue of Walvis Bay, Tjongarero said that SWAPO would never accept South Africa's territorial claims over Walvis Bay. He stated that Walvis Bay would ultimately return to Namibia through negotiations or other means.

	On the same day, the assistant to the United Nations Secretary-General's special representative, Cedric Thornberry, said at a press conference that SWAPO and South Africa would begin a ceasefire at 4:00 AM on April 1. The ceasefire is arranged by the United Nations Secretary-General and agreed upon by all relevant parties.

	Thornberry mentioned that 1,000 military personnel and 100 civilian staff of the United Nations assistance team have already arrived in Namibia.

	South Africa has ruled Namibia for 74 years. According to UN Security Council Resolution 435, Namibia will hold elections this November to achieve independence.

　　纳米比亚独立进程开始
    西南非洲人民组织重申对安理会决议承担义务
    新华社温得和克３月３０日电  （记者熊仲琪）西南非洲人民组织今天重申了对即将于４月１日开始实施的联合国安理会关于纳米比亚问题的４３５号决议所承担的义务。
    西南非洲人民组织代理主席丹尼尔·琼哈雷罗今天在此间的一次记者招待会上说，西南非洲人民组织珍视用和平手段解决冲突，它所进行的武装斗争只是对特定的局势作出的反应。他号召纳米比亚人民为实现和平承担义务。
    琼哈雷罗欢迎联合国纳米比亚过渡时期援助团来到纳米比亚。他说，这有助于和平稳定地实施联合国安理会４３５号决议。
    谈到南非同独立的纳米比亚的关系时，琼哈雷罗说，这种关系将是主权国家之间的关系，它们之间没有特殊的关系。
    琼哈雷罗还排除了独立的纳米比亚政府将允许南非非洲人国民大会在其领土上设置军事基地的可能性。
    他在谈到沃尔维斯湾的归属问题时说，西南非洲人民组织绝不会接受南非对沃尔维斯湾的领土要求，沃尔维斯湾将通过谈判或其他方式最终回到纳米比亚的怀抱。
    同一天，联合国秘书长特别代表的助手塞德维克·索恩伯格在记者招待会上说，西南非洲人民组织同南非之间将于４月１日凌晨４点钟开始停火，停火是由联合国秘书长安排的，并得到有关各方的同意。
    索恩伯格说，联合国援助团的１０００名军事人员和１００名文职人员已到达纳米比亚。
    南非统治纳米比亚已达７４年。根据联合国安理会４３５号决议，纳米比亚将于今年１１月举行大选，实现独立。
