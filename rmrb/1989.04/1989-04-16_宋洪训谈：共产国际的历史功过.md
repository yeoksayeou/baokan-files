Title: Song Hongxin on the Historical Merits and Demerits of the Communist International

Edition: 6

Song Hongxin, in an article published in the sixth issue of *Seeking Truth* in 1989, discusses the historical merits and demerits of the Communist International. He notes that, overall, the Communist International's activities can be summarized into four main historical achievements:

1. Spreading Marxism-Leninism and combating right-wing opportunism and "leftist infantile disorder" within the communist movement.
2. Assisting various countries' proletariat in establishing their vanguard parties.
3. Supporting workers' movements in capitalist countries and national liberation movements in colonial and semi-colonial regions.
4. Conducting struggles against aggressive wars and fascism.

However, the Communist International also gradually exhibited a "leftist" line throughout its activities. This line included both the tendency to dogmatize Marxism and the inclination to sanctify Soviet experiences. When guiding revolutions in various countries, the Communist International often did not consider the unique political, economic, cultural, and national characteristics of each country. Instead, it demanded that all communist parties adhere to a single resolution or directive. This approach is evident in the following three aspects:

1. An overly optimistic assessment of the global revolutionary situation.
2. An underestimation of capitalism's self-adjustment capabilities and development potential.
3. An underestimation of the influence of social democratic traditions and social democratic parties among the working masses.

　　宋洪训谈：共产国际的历史功过
    宋洪训在《求是》杂志一九八九年第六期撰文说，从总体上看，共产国际在其全部活动中比较突出的历史功绩大致有以下四个方面：一、传播马克思列宁主义，同右倾机会主义和共运中的“左倾幼稚病”进行斗争；二、帮助各国无产阶级建立自己的先锋队；三、支援资本主义国家的工人运动和殖民地半殖民地的民族解放运动；四、开展反对侵略战争和反对法西斯的斗争。但是，共产国际在其整个活动中也逐渐表现出一条“左”的路线，既包含着把马克思主义教条化的因素，也包含着把苏联经验神圣化的倾向。共产国际在指导各国革命时，往往不是根据各国的不同情况，不是考虑到各国政治、经济、文化以至民族的特点来制定适合各国国情的方针政策，而相反要求各国共产党都根据一个决议、一个指令来办事。这条路线大致表现在以下三个方面：一、对世界革命形势的估计过于乐观，二、对资本主义的自我调整能力和发展潜力估计不足，三、对社会民主主义传统和社会民主党在工人群众中的影响估计不足。
