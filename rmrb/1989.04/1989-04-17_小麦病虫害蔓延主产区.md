Currently, wheat diseases and pests such as powdery mildew, Fusarium head blight, aphids, stripe rust, and red spider mites are spreading in the major wheat-producing areas of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, Sichuan, and Gansu.

According to investigations, wheat powdery mildew has begun to occur widely in many areas of the Huaihe River basin. In Xinghua, Jiangsu, the survey showed that the disease incidence rate of wheat Fusarium head blight is 100%, and the disease severity rate is 41.2%. The infestation rate of wheat mites is high. According to statistics from Luoyang City, there are 263 long-legged mites per square meter, with some areas reaching 1,600. In Zizhong, Sichuan, it was found that there are an average of 460 aphids per 100 wheat plants, with some areas reaching 2,000. Experts believe that the mild winter last year has led to an early onset of pests this year. Various regions should take effective measures to do a good job in prevention and control.
