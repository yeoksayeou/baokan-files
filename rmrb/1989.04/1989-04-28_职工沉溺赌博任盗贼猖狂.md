Employees Engage in Gambling, Allowing Thieves to Run Rampant

The grain depot of the grain bureau in Huo Town, our county, has 23 employees, 20 of whom are involved in gambling. Due to the negligence of the leaders of the grain bureau and the depot in management, the work at the depot is lax, and security and protection work is neglected. On the night of February 11, thieves took advantage of the employees' gambling to steal 180,000 grain tickets and 25,000 yuan in cash.

　　职工沉溺赌博任盗贼猖狂
    我县粮食局驻虢镇粮食转运站有职工二十三名，有二十人参与赌博。由于粮食局、转运站领导同志疏于管理，转运站的工作松松垮垮，安全保卫工作也无人过问。二月十一日晚，盗贼趁职工聚赌时，窃走了十八万斤粮票、二万五千元现金。
