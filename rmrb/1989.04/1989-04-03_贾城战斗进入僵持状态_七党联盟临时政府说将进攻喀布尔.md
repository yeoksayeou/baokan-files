The battle for Jalalabad, where Afghan Mujahideen have been fighting government forces for the past 26 days, has reached a stalemate, according to observers.

Both sides are now exchanging sporadic artillery fire.

Reports indicate that government forces have retaken the Parchan and Gulam Khan security posts near Jalalabad, which had been seized by the Mujahideen.

Mujahideen sources say that several Soviet-made Scud missiles have landed on their positions in recent days. One missile hit the Dolham border post, just 300 meters from the Pakistani border, killing nine people and injuring 17.

Kabul Radio reports that hundreds of Mujahideen are being killed daily in the battle for Jalalabad.

Since the Mujahideen launched their offensive on Jalalabad, more than 20,000 Afghans have fled to Pakistan, becoming refugees. Most of them are elderly, women, and children.

The Mujahideen's Seven-Party Alliance Interim Government's Defense Minister, Maulvi Muhammad, said today in Islamabad that the interim government has formulated a plan to block all roads leading out of Kabul.

He added that the interim government is discussing final plans to launch military attacks on all major cities in Afghanistan, including Kabul.

　　贾城战斗进入僵持状态
    七党联盟临时政府说将进攻喀布尔
    新华社伊斯兰堡４月１日电  阿富汗游击队攻打喀布尔政府军控制的贾拉拉巴德市的战斗今天进入第２６天，观察家们普遍认为，这场战斗已陷入僵持状态。
    双方的炮火已变得零零星星。
    据报道，游击队攻占的贾拉拉巴德市附近帕尔坎和古拉姆汗达安全哨所，已被喀布尔政府军重新夺回。
    据阿富汗游击队人士说，在过去的几天里，一些苏制飞毛腿导弹落到游击队的阵地上。其中一枚落到距巴基斯坦边界３００米处的多尔哈姆边境哨所，炸死９人，炸伤１７人。
    据喀布尔电台广播说，在贾拉拉巴德攻防战中，每天有数以百计的游击队员被打死。
    自游击队攻打贾拉拉巴德市以来，已有２万余阿富汗人涌入巴基斯坦，沦为难民，其中大多数为老人、妇女和儿童。
    新华社伊斯兰堡４月１日电　阿富汗七党联盟临时政府国防部长毛勒维·穆罕默迪今天在这里说，临时政府已制定出封锁喀布尔通往外界的所有道路的计划。
    他还说，临时政府正在讨论对包括喀布尔市在内的阿富汗所有大城市的军事设施发动进攻的最后计划。
