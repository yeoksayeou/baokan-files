One year in early February, I stayed for a few days in a small city on the Loess Plateau in northern Shaanxi. Fortunately, I encountered a sunny day after the snow, so I was full of enthusiasm to visit the Yellow River a few miles away. This is the middle section of the Jin-Shan Gorge, with red cliffs towering on both banks, squeezing the riverbed into a narrow, winding, and deep shape. From afar, I could hear the deep, rumbling sound, echoing at the top of the snow-covered cliffs. Under the sun, the mist in the valley was warm and clear, covering the surging river in early spring. When I stood on the bridge, I saw the spectacle of the Yellow River's ice floes.

To be honest, the Yellow River by my side had changed from its usual copper-like color to a restless and muddy appearance, with transparent, crystalline, and snowy hues. Ice blocks in various shapes—plates, strips, rhombuses, cones, and circles—were colliding, jostling, wandering, and hesitating on the turbulent surface of the Yellow River, moving forward sluggishly. The waves and surging tides were made awkward by these frozen liquids, as if every movement was an attempt to stand up. These ice floes resembled small boats, or lotus flowers, or irregular boulders, making the surface of the Yellow River flow more slowly. However, the surging underneath was rapid, not delayed by the heavy burden of its journey. When the Yellow River struck the cliffs, it no longer sounded like a pure liquid but was mixed with the cracking sounds of solid impacts. This was the Yellow River's deep and proud breath as it bid farewell to winter and welcomed spring.

I have seen the Yellow River in the shape of a bow on the Ordos Plateau, the magnificent sight of the "Yellow River's entire flow collected in a single pot" at the Hukou Waterfall, the heroic posture of the Yellow River at Yumen, and the mighty waves turning east at Tongguan. However, the scene before me moved me even more. I thought that the Yellow River in the ice floe season was not as abundant and vast as in spring and summer, nor as fierce and reckless as in the autumn floods. After becoming thin in winter, it began to stir with life, struggling to break free from its chains, shedding its hard crust, melting its barriers, and roaring forward. It carried its winter burden with a broad chest, digesting its own tumors with a magnificent demeanor, flowing towards the vast sea. Only the ice floes would collapse, but the Yellow River would forever flow.

It is said that the ice floes can form ice dams, and the melting ice fragments can re-form into large solids, obstructing the Yellow River's course. In the struggle between the surging water and the ice floes, the ice blocks might temporarily gain the upper hand, but the final victory would still belong to the soft and resilient water flow. Perhaps at some point downstream or at the estuary, the Yellow River would completely dissolve the finest ice particles, deposit the turbid carryings, and flow into a beautiful realm. Of course, with the cycles of cold and warm seasons, there would definitely be the Yellow River's joys, angers, sorrows, and pleasures. This is the law of nature. The Yellow River is confidently going through another ice floe season, one of its countless cycles.

I remember once walking closer to the shore and picking up a small piece of ice from the water, watching it melt into spring water in my palm. The pulse of the mother river's blood that I felt then still makes me passionate and thoughtful to this day.

    有一年正二月间，我在陕北高原的一座小城里逗留了几天。恰好碰上雪晴的日子，我便游兴十足地去看几里外的黄河。这儿是晋陕峡谷的中段，两岸皆是赤色石崖雄踞，把个河床夹得又曲又窄又深。远远就听见了那浑厚的声音，轰轰嚯嚯的，回荡于白皑皑的高崖之巅。太阳下的空谷，氤氲着带有泥腥味的雾岚，温和而清醒地覆盖了涌流在早春季节里的大河。站到桥头上的时候，我看见了黄河凌汛的景观。
    说实话，我身边的黄河已一改铜汁般的肤色，显出浮躁而混浊的冰缘，还有透明晶莹和雪白。冰雪的团块，有板状的条状的菱形的锥形的圆形的各种形象，在黄河急流的背脊上冲撞着拥挤着徘徊着踟踌着向前蠕动。波浪的流线和狂涛的形态，被这些板结凝固了的液体弄得很别扭，似乎每流动一步就有无数次想站立起来的姿势。这些冰凌，宛若小舟，或像莲花，或如同不规则的顽石，使黄河的表面明显地缓慢了流速。然而，冰下的涌动是湍急的，并不因为沉重的行囊而贻误了万里流程。黄河在拍击崖岸时，便不再是纯液体的声音，而渗透了固体所撞击时发出的咔嚓嚓的巨响。这当是黄河在告别冬天迎迓春天时的一阵深沉而自豪的呼吸。
    我看见过呈弯弓状的鄂尔多斯草原上的黄河，看见过“天下黄河一壶收”的壶口瀑布的壮景，看见过禹门的黄河雄姿和潼关折流东去的巨澜，眼前的景观却更使我为之动情。我想，这流凌时节的黄河，没有春夏之际那么丰盈壮阔，没有秋汛季节那么慓悍莽撞，它在冬日消瘦之后便有了生命的骚动，开始挣脱身上的锁链，剥离硬痂，融化隔膜，咆哮着呐喊着行路了。它负重前去，以宽阔的胸怀包容了去冬的遗物，以恢宏的气度消化着自身的肿瘤，朝着苍海奔流。崩溃的只有冰凌，而黄河永远是流动的。
    据说凌汛会筑起冰堤，解冻的冰屑也会重新结集成巨大的固体，妨碍了黄河的行程。就在涌流与冰凌的较量中，凌块许会一时占据上风，但最终的胜利还是属于软而韧性的水流。也许就在下游的某一处河面上，或在入海口，黄河会彻底溶解了最细碎的冰粒，沉淀了污浊的携带物，流入美的境界。当然，有轮回的寒暑冷暖就肯定有黄河的喜怒哀乐，这是自然界的规律所在。黄河，正自信地度过它若干万次后的又一番凌汛的季节。
    记得我曾步向近岸，从水中捞起一小块冰，看着他在我的掌心化为春水。我所感受到的母亲之河的血脉的节拍，至今仍使我壮怀激烈，沉思不已。
