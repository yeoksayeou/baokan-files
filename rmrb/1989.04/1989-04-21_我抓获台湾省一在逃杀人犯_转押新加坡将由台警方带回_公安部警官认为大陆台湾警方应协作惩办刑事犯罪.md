Taiwan province's fugitive murderer captured
Transferred to Singapore, to be taken back by Taiwanese police
Public Security Bureau officials believe mainland and Taiwanese police should cooperate to punish criminal offenders

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 21 (Reporter Zou Aiguo) A fugitive murderer wanted by Taiwanese police, Yang Mingzong, was escorted by mainland public security officers onto China Airlines flight CA977 to Singapore today.

Upon arrival in Singapore, our officers handed Yang Mingzong over to Singaporean police at the aircraft door, who then handed him over to Taiwanese police to be taken back to Taiwan for trial.

Yang Mingzong was apprehended at Shanghai Hongqiao Airport on August 3 last year. At the time, Yang Mingzong attempted to board China Airlines flight CA923 from Shanghai to Tokyo. Border inspection personnel at Hongqiao Airport discovered that his Singapore passport had obvious signs of forgery and that his height did not match the information on the passport.

Upon investigation, Yang Mingzong, 30, was found to be a shareholder of the Jixiang Travel Company in Taoyuan, Taiwan. On December 8, 1987, he had a fight with another shareholder, Zhuang Fushan, over economic issues and killed Zhuang. To evade police capture, he purchased a Singapore passport for 100,000 Taiwanese dollars. On February 26 last year, Yang Mingzong used this forged and altered passport to escape to Tokyo, and on May 17, he fled to the Philippines. On July 7, he arrived in Xiamen.

It is understood that after Yang Mingzong was captured, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security took various measures to contact Taiwanese police to seek a quick resolution to the case. However, due to Taiwan's insistence on the "three nos" policy, the efforts of the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security were unsuccessful.

Given that Yang Mingzong also committed the crime of forging a Singapore passport, the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security agreed to transfer Yang Mingzong to Singapore and then hand him over to Taiwanese police.

A senior officer from the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security, after introducing the case, pointed out that punishing criminal activities should be a common goal for mainland and Taiwanese police. With the increasing economic and cultural exchanges across the strait, cooperation in various aspects, including police work, is inevitable. Mainland and Taiwanese police should strengthen contact and leave no gaps in punishing criminal offenders.

The officer expressed gratitude to the Singaporean police for their efforts in facilitating the transfer of Yang Mingzong.

　　我抓获台湾省一在逃杀人犯    
    转押新加坡将由台警方带回    
    公安部警官认为大陆台湾警方应协作惩办刑事犯罪
    新华社北京４月２１日电（记者邹爱国）台湾省警方通缉的杀人犯杨明宗，今天在我公安机关警官押解下乘坐中国民航ＣＡ９７７航班飞赴新加坡。
    航班抵达新加坡时，我警官在机舱舱口将杨明宗交给新加坡警方，然后再由台湾省警方将他押回台湾受审。
    杨明宗是去年８月３日在上海虹桥机场被查获的。
    当时，杨明宗企图乘坐上海至东京的ＣＡ９２３航班出境。虹桥机场边检人员发现他所持新加坡护照有明显伪造疑点，而且杨明宗本人身高与护照所填不符。
    经查，杨明宗，３０岁，原系台湾桃园吉祥游览公司股东。１９８７年１２月８日，因经济问题他与公司另一股东庄福山发生殴斗，将庄福山打死。为了逃避警方追捕，他用１０万台币买得一本新加坡护照。去年２月２６日，杨明宗持这本经过涂改、伪造的护照逃往东京，５月１７日从东京逃往菲律宾，７月７日又从菲律宾来到厦门市。
    据了解，杨明宗被抓获后，公安部刑事侦察局曾采取多种措施与台湾省警方联系，以寻求尽快解决此案的办法，由于台湾坚持执行“三不”政策，公安部刑事侦察局的种种努力未能成功。
    鉴于杨明宗还犯有伪造新加坡护照罪，公安部刑事侦察局同意将杨明宗押至新加坡，再递解台湾省警方。
    公安部刑事侦察局高级警官在介绍案情后指出，惩办刑事犯罪活动应是中国大陆警方和台湾省警方的共同目标。随着海峡两岸经济、文化交流的逐渐增多，包括警方在内的各方面的协作是不可避免的。大陆、台湾省警方应加强接触，在惩办刑事犯罪方面，不能留空白地区。
    这位警官对新加坡警方在促成递解杨明宗过程中的努力表示感谢。
