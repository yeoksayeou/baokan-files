	Shenyang's rubber casting factory, which has been severely loss-making and in debt, officially declared bankruptcy on April 21 and will auction off its assets to repay part of its debts.

	The Shenyang Rubber Casting Factory is a collective enterprise under the Shenyang Petrochemical Management Bureau. The factory has three workshops: mechanical processing, rubber casting, and rubber products, with a total of 215 employees, including 119 retirees. The current assets of the enterprise are valued at 176,000 yuan, while its debts amount to 936,000 yuan, making it severely insolvent. After receiving a yellow-card warning from the Shenyang Municipal Government on March 4, 1987, the factory underwent two years of restructuring but showed no signs of recovery. With the approval of the Shenyang Municipal Government, the factory has now been declared bankrupt.
