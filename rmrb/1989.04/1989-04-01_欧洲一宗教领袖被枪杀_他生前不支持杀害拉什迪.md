European Religious Leader Assassinated
He Did Not Support the Killing of Rushdie

The Belgian daily newspaper reported today that the director of the Islamic Cultural Center in Belgium, Adil, and his assistant were shot dead yesterday in their office. Each of them was shot twice in the head.

Adil was the religious leader of Muslims in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. He recently stated in an interview with Belgian television that although he strongly disliked Salman Rushdie's "The Satanic Verses," he did not support the death sentence imposed on the British novelist by Iran's religious leader Khomeini. After this television interview, he had received threatening phone calls and death threats.

The Belgian government considers this murder a serious incident and believes it is likely the first act of violence in the Western world following Khomeini's order to kill Rushdie. Currently, the Belgian government has established a crisis center. Representatives from the Prime Minister's Office, the Minister of Justice, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs are all participating in this center.

　　欧洲一宗教领袖被枪杀
    他生前不支持杀害拉什迪
    新华社布鲁塞尔３月３０日电  《比利时日报》今天报道说，比利时伊斯兰文化中心主任阿达尔和他的一名助手昨天在这里被人枪杀。
    这两个人的尸体是在他们的办公室里被发现的，每个人头部都中了两枪。
    阿达尔是比、荷、卢３国穆斯林的宗教领袖。他不久前接受比利时电视台采访时曾表示，他虽然对拉什迪的《撒旦诗篇》一书很反感，但不支持伊朗宗教领袖霍梅尼判处这位英国小说作家死刑。在发表了这篇电视讲话之后，他曾接到过恐吓电话和将被处死的威胁。
    比利时政府认为，这起凶杀案是一个严重的事件，很可能是霍梅尼发出处死拉什迪的命令后，凶手在西方世界开的第一刀。目前比利时政府已成立了一个危机中心。首相府的代表和司法大臣及外交大臣的代表都参加了这个中心。
