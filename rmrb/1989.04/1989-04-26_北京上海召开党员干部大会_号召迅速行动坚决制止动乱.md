Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 26th.

The Communist Party of China Beijing Municipal Committee held a meeting of grassroots party members and cadres in the Great Hall of the People this afternoon, calling on all party members and the broad masses of cadres, workers, peasants, students, residents, as well as members of democratic parties and patriotic democratic personages, to take immediate action to resolutely and swiftly stop the turmoil created by a very small number of people, and to maintain the hard-won political situation of stability and unity.

The meeting was attended by 10,000 people.

Li Xixin, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary of the CPC Beijing Municipal Committee, said in his speech that at present, a very small number of people with ulterior motives are using the opportunity of students mourning Hu Yaobang to deliberately spread rumors and incite unsuspecting young students to storm Zhongnanhai, attack party and state leaders by name, and even shout reactionary slogans such as "overthrow the Communist Party." He said that after the end of Hu Yaobang's funeral, some students engaged in activities such as posting big-character posters, linking up, organizing "fighting teams," and establishing illegal student organizations, which are creating chaos.

Li Xixin said that we can no longer tolerate this turmoil. If we do not resolutely stop this turmoil, the country will have no peace. We must take decisive measures to stop it swiftly and maintain the political situation of stability and unity in the capital and the country.

Li Xixin demanded that all party members and the people of the city seriously study the editorial of the People's Daily, "We Must Clearly Oppose the Turmoil," and maintain consistency with the Party Central Committee in thought and action; all levels of leading cadres in the city should go deep into the grassroots, patiently do the ideological work among the masses, and distinguish the inappropriate words and deeds of some young students from the plots of a very small number of people with ulterior motives; we must heighten vigilance, maintain public order, and mobilize the masses of the city to resolutely fight against the few who engage in beating, smashing, looting, and arson; strictly prohibit the posting of slogans, speeches, and other illegal activities in public places such as streets, and once discovered, relevant departments should immediately deal with them according to law; resolutely disband illegal organizations, and no unit should provide venues for these organizations to engage in illegal activities; strictly prohibit linking up, especially pay attention to protecting the physical and mental health of primary and secondary school students; all party members in the city should take the lead in doing a good job of working with their family members and children to prevent being deceived.

Chen Xitong, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Beijing Municipal Committee and Mayor, said at the meeting that the editorial of the People's Daily represents the opinion of the Party Central Committee, and the conclusion drawn about this incident is correct. He demanded that all party members in the city clearly oppose the turmoil with practical actions.

Wang Jiaquan, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Beijing Municipal Committee, reported on the situation of the turmoil at the meeting and clarified many rumors that mislead people.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 26th.

Jiang Zemin, Secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, reported on some abnormal situations that have occurred recently in other places and in Shanghai, as well as the measures taken by the Shanghai Municipal Committee. He pointed out that the overall situation in Shanghai is good, but some colleges and universities have also appeared with big and small character posters directly aimed at the party and state leaders. Some students have used gatherings and speeches to spread more explicit erroneous statements. Some people with ulterior motives have repeatedly tried to pull college students onto the streets to parade. Faced with these situations, the Municipal Committee and the Municipal Government have held several meetings to study and clearly oppose them, and have also issued a "Notice" in a timely manner, explicitly proposing to "prevent bad people from taking advantage of the situation, stirring up trouble, and engaging in destructive activities." The vast majority of students in Shanghai's colleges and universities are broad-minded and consider the big picture. Therefore, Shanghai has not seen large-scale street parades, strikes, or disruption of normal living order.

Jiang Zemin demanded that all party members and the people of the city: First, seriously study the important spirit conveyed by the editorial of the People's Daily, "We Must Clearly Oppose the Turmoil." Second, take effective measures to resolutely maintain the hard-won situation of stability and unity. Do not allow the establishment of any illegal organizations; prohibit illegal parades and demonstrations; prohibit linking up in various forms to factories, rural areas, schools, and agencies; for big and small character posters and slogans with excessive content, take them away resolutely; for those who engage in beating, smashing, looting, and arson, take legal action and punish them severely. Third, adhere to reform and opening up, rectification and order, invigorate the spirit, unite as one, overcome difficulties, and contribute to the revitalization of Shanghai and the revitalization of China. Fourth, organize the "May 1st" and "May 4th" memorial activities well.

Jiang Zemin also announced at the meeting: In view of the fact that Qin Benli, editor-in-chief and member of the Party Group of the "World Economic Herald," has seriously violated discipline, it is decided to stop his leading position and rectify the "World Economic Herald."

　　北京上海召开党员干部大会  号召迅速行动坚决制止动乱
    新华社北京４月２６日电  中共北京市委今天下午在人民大会堂召开全市基层党员干部大会，号召全市共产党员和广大干部、工人、农民、学生、居民以及各民主党派成员、爱国民主人士，积极行动起来，坚决、迅速地制止由极少数人制造的动乱，维护得来不易的安定团结的政治局面。
    参加大会的有１万人。
    中共中央政治局委员、中共北京市委书记李锡铭在大会上讲话指出，当前有极少数别有用心的人借学生悼念胡耀邦同志的机会，蓄意制造谣言，煽动不明真相的青年学生冲击新华门，指名攻击党和国家领导人，甚至有人喊出“打倒共产党”等反动口号。他说，部分学生在胡耀邦同志追悼会结束以后进行的张贴大字报、搞串连、组织“战斗队”、成立非法的学生组织等活动，是在制造混乱。
    李锡铭说，我们对这场动乱不能再容忍了。不坚决制止这场动乱，将国无宁日。我们要采取坚决措施迅速加以制止，以维护首都和全国安定团结的政治局面。
    李锡铭要求全市共产党员和全市人民认真学习人民日报《必须旗帜鲜明地反对动乱》的社论，在思想上和行动上与党中央保持一致；全市各级领导干部要深入实际，耐心做好群众的思想工作，把广大青年学生的某些不妥当的言行同极少数别有用心的人的阴谋区别开来；要提高警惕，搞好社会治安，发动全市群众同少数搞打、砸、抢、烧的人进行坚决斗争；严禁在街头等公共场所张贴标语、演讲和进行其他非法活动，一旦发现，有关部门要立即依法进行处理；要坚决取缔非法组织，各单位不得为这些组织提供进行非法活动的场所；要严格禁止串联，特别要注意保护中、小学生的身心健康；全市党员要带头做好家属及子女的工作，以防上当受骗。
    中共北京市委副书记、市长陈希同在会上说，人民日报社论是代表党中央的意见的，对这次事件作这样的结论是正确的。他要求全市共产党员以实际行动旗帜鲜明地反对动乱。
    中共北京市委副书记汪家镠在会上通报了关于动乱的情况，并澄清了许多蛊惑人心的谣传。
    本报上海４月２６日电　记者萧关根报道：中共上海市委、市政府旗帜鲜明地反对当前的动乱。今天，市委召开全市有１．４万多人参加的党员干部大会，动员上海全体共产党员和全市人民积极行动起来，为坚决、迅速地制止这场动乱而斗争。
    市委书记江泽民在讲话中，首先通报了近日来外地和上海发生的一些不正常情况以及上海市采取的措施。他指出，上海总的情况是好的，但是部分高校也出现了一些矛头直接指向党和国家领导人的大、小字报。有些学生利用集会、演讲散布了一些更为露骨的错误言论。一些别有用心的人多次想把高校学生拉上街游行，面对这些情况，市委、市政府多次开会研究旗帜鲜明地加以反对，还及时发出了《通告》，明确提出要“严防坏人借题发挥，挑起事端，进行破坏活动”。上海高校的学生极大多数是识大体、顾大局的。因此，上海没有出现大规模的上街游行，没有出现罢课，没有影响正常生活秩序。
    江泽民要求全体党员和全市人民：一、认真学习人民日报社论《必须旗帜鲜明地反对动乱》所传达的党中央的重要精神。二、要采取有效措施，坚决维护得来不易的安定团结的局面。决不允许成立任何非法组织；禁止非法游行示威；禁止以各种形式到工厂、农村、学校、机关进行串联；对于内容出格的大小字报、标语等，要坚决取去；对于打、砸、抢、烧的人，要依法制裁，予以严惩。三、坚持改革开放、治理整顿，振奋精神，同心协力，克服困难，为振兴上海、振兴中华作出贡献。四、要切实组织好“五一”、“五四”纪念活动。
    江泽民同志还在会上宣布：鉴于《世界经济导报》总编辑、党组成员钦本立同志严重违反纪律，决定停止他的领导职务，并对《世界经济导报》进行整顿。
