Vice Premier Yao Yilin met with British guests

	BEIJING, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Vice Premier Yao Yilin met with Sir Shih Yat-tsiu, chairman of the Jardine Matheson Group, and his delegation in the Great Hall of the People this morning.

	Sir Shih said that the Jardine Matheson Group is very interested in China's development. The group has investments in Hong Kong and will continue to invest there. Hong Kong is the focus of the Jardine Matheson Group's business.

	Yao Yilin welcomed the Jardine Matheson Group's continued investment in Hong Kong. He said that the Chinese government's policy towards Hong Kong is "one country, two systems." The Chinese government hopes to see a stable and prosperous Hong Kong. The development of the Chinese mainland's economy may have its ups and downs, but this will not affect the Chinese government's policy towards Hong Kong.

	Sir Shih said that the Jardine Matheson Group has confidence in Hong Kong. He expressed that the group not only wants to continue investing in Hong Kong but is also willing to invest in mainland China. Yao Yilin hoped that the Jardine Matheson Group would make greater contributions to Hong Kong's prosperity and wished the group greater benefits from Hong Kong's development. Rong Yiren, chairman of the China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) Group, was also present at the meeting.

　　姚依林会见英国客人
    据新华社北京４月２６日电  国务院副总理姚依林今天上午在人民大会堂会见了英国太古集团主席施雅迪爵士一行。
    施雅迪说，太古集团对中国的发展非常感兴趣。太古集团在香港有投资，并将继续向香港投资。香港是太古集团的业务重点。
    姚依林对太古集团在香港继续投资表示欢迎。他说，中国政府对香港的政策是实行“一国两制”。中国政府希望看到一个稳定、繁荣的香港。中国内地经济的发展有时好一些，有时困难一些，但这不会影响中国政府对香港的政策。
    施雅迪说，太古集团对香港是有信心的。他表示，太古集团不仅要继续在香港的投资，也愿意向中国内地投资。姚依林希望太古集团为香港的繁荣作出更大的贡献，也祝愿太古集团从香港的发展中得到更大的受益。中国国际信托投资公司（集团）董事长荣毅仁等会见时在座。
