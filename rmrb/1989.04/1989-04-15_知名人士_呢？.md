	And the Famous Figures?
	Li Chun

	On the eve of the Spring Festival, I left a small city by boat heading east. From the local radio station's news broadcast on the passenger ship, I heard a report about local leaders and famous figures from the theoretical, educational, news, and arts circles holding a New Year's gathering. As an intellectual, I felt a warmth in my heart: the Spring Festival is here, and the party and government leaders are holding a gathering with famous intellectuals, which is actually a care for the broad masses of intellectuals! However, the entire news report only covered the speech of one leader and did not mention the name of any famous figure or the activities of the famous figures. I muttered to myself: And the famous figures?

	After the ship docked, I found the local newspaper from a friend. The first page of the newspaper also published the news of this gathering, with the main headline reading "A Cup of Tea, Sharing Heartfelt Words," and the subheadline reading "The Propaganda Department Invites Famous Figures from the Ideological and Cultural Circles to Hold a New Year's Gathering." However, the news did not mention the leaders and famous figures "sharing," nor could one see what "heartfelt words" were shared, making the text and the title completely inconsistent. I muttered to myself again: And the famous figures?

	If the leader's speech at the gathering has new ideas, new viewpoints, new content, or new measures and methods to solve important problems, it is very necessary and welcome to highlight the leader's speech. Unfortunately, many leaders' speeches at such gatherings are drafted by others, or pieced together from various sources, lacking both genuine emotion and new ideas, which makes people feel bored.

	Similar situations as mentioned above are not uncommon in some local news media. For example, news reports about sending advanced figures and labor models to Beijing to attend the national commendation conference often do not mention the names of the advanced figures and labor models, but the news contains long lists of leaders from various sectors. Every time I see such news, I can't help but ask, do readers want to know about the advanced figures and labor models, or the leaders who frequently appear in the newspapers? Who should be the main subject of such news reports?

	As the ears and mouthpiece of the party and government, it is very necessary for the news media to timely publish the guidelines and policies of the party and government leadership organs, as well as report important speeches by leaders. However, who should be the main subject of more news reports? The answer is clear: it is the broad masses of the people.

	What do readers most want to know? What do they most love? Perhaps this is something that the responsible persons, reporters, and editors of our news agencies should often study and keep in mind. I don't know why, in reporting famous figures, we can't find the famous figures, and in reporting news, we can't find the real news figures.

### “知名人士”呢？

　　“知名人士”呢？
　　李纯
    春节前夕，我离开某小城乘船东下，从客轮转播地方电台的新闻广播中，听到报道当地领导和理论、教育、新闻、文艺界知名人士举行迎春座谈的消息。作为一名知识分子，感到心头一热：春节到了，党政领导和知名的知识分子座谈，实际也是对广大知识分子的关怀啊！但是，通篇消息只报道了一位领导人的讲话，并没有提到任何知名人士的名字和知名人士的活动。我心里嘀咕：知名人士呢？
    客轮靠岸之后，我从友人那儿找到当天当地的日报。报纸的第一版也刊登了这个座谈会的消息，主标题是《清茶一杯，共叙衷肠》，副标题是《宣传部邀请思想文化界知名人士举行迎春座谈》。但消息中既没有领导与知名人士“共叙”，当然也看不出叙了什么“衷肠”，文与题全然不符。我心里又在嘀咕：知名人士呢？
    领导人在座谈会上的讲话如果有新精神、新观点、新内容，或者有解决重要问题的新措施、新办法，突出报道领导人的讲话，是非常必要的，也是会受到欢迎的。可惜不少座谈会上领导人的讲话是别人代拟的，或东拼西凑，既无真情，也无新话，这就会使人感到腻味了。
    类似上述情况，在一些地方新闻媒介中并不少见。比如，报道欢送先进人物、劳动模范进京出席全国表彰大会的消息，常常是找不到先进人物、劳动模范的名字，消息中却有长串各方面领导人的名单。每每看到这类消息，不禁要问，读者想知道的究竟是先进人物、劳动模范呢，还是经常出现在报端的领导人呢？这类新闻报道的主体应该是谁呢？
    新闻媒介作为党和政府的耳目喉舌，及时刊载党和政府领导机关的方针、政策，以及报道领导人的重要讲话，都是非常必要的。但是，更多的新闻报道的主体应是谁？答案是肯定的，那就是广大人民群众。
    读者最需要知道什么？最喜爱什么？恐怕是我们新闻机构的负责人、记者、编辑们应该经常研究，牢记在心的。不知在报道知名人士时又找不到知名人士，报道新闻时找不到真正的新闻人物。
