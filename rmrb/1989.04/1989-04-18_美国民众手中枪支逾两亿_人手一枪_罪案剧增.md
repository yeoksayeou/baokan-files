	According to reports in U.S. newspapers today, in the past year, 33,000 Americans died from gun-related incidents (including being shot and suicide by gun), meaning that every 16 minutes, one American dies from a gun-related incident. This is currently a serious social problem in the United States.

	When the United States was fighting for independence, Americans used guns to resist colonial rulers and defend themselves. Therefore, the Constitution stipulates that U.S. citizens have the right to own guns. In recent years, with deteriorating public security in the United States, more and more people are buying guns for self-defense. However, many guns have fallen into the hands of drug dealers and thieves, leading to a surge in gun-related crimes.

	Currently, there are 15,000 gun stores in the United States. U.S. citizens can purchase guns with just a driver's license. Additionally, there are underground gun trafficking groups that provide easily concealable and rapidly firing weapons to drug dealers and other criminals.

	According to a recent estimate by the "National Rifle Association" in the United States, there are now two billion various types of firearms in the hands of U.S. citizens, almost one gun per person. During family disputes, children can pull out guns and shoot; on the streets, juvenile delinquents even use guns to rob. The misuse of guns has increased social chaos, and the police are overwhelmed but helpless.

### 美国民众手中枪支逾两亿　人手一枪　罪案剧增

　　美国民众手中枪支逾两亿
　　人手一枪　罪案剧增
    本报纽约４月１７日电　记者刘开宸报道：据美国报纸今天报道，近一年，美国人死于枪击（被枪击和用枪自杀）的人数为３３０００人，即每１６分钟就有１名美国人死于枪击之下，是当前美国的一个严重社会问题。
    美国争取独立时，美国人以枪支对抗殖民者以保卫自己，所以宪法上规定，美国公民有拥有枪支的权利。近年来，美国社会治安不好，越来越多的人购买枪支自卫。但许多枪支落入贩毒分子和盗窃分子手中，枪杀犯罪案件剧增。
    现在，美国共有１５０００家枪械店，美国公民只要凭汽车驾驶执照就可以购买枪支。此外，还有地下的贩枪集团，为贩毒分子等歹徒提供既易隐藏又能快速发射的武器。
    据美国“全国步枪协会”最近估计，现在美国民众手中共有各种短武器两亿支，几乎人手一支枪。在家庭争吵中，小孩也会拔枪开火；街头上，少年歹徒甚至持枪抢劫。枪支的滥用增加了社会混乱，警察疲于奔命，却也无可奈何。
