Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 2nd.

The deputy procurator-general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, Zhang Sīqīng, said today in an interview with a reporter that all levels of procuratorate should support citizens and police officers in exercising their right to lawful self-defense, protecting their enthusiasm for fighting against criminal activities. Zhang made these remarks in response to the current severe situation of social security.

He said that the Criminal Law of our country stipulates that actions taken in lawful self-defense to protect public interests, one's own or others' personal and property rights from ongoing illegal infringements are not subject to legal liability. However, currently, some criminals and their families are dissatisfied with the decision not to pursue legal responsibility for those who acted in lawful self-defense. They are also unhappy with the recognition of those who have acted bravely and in lawful self-defense. Some even storm procuratorate offices. Due to the poor handling of such incidents in some places, the enthusiasm of citizens and police officers to fight against criminals has been dampened, and to some extent, it has emboldened the criminals.

Zhang believes that lawful self-defense is not only a right of citizens but also, in a sense, a duty. He said that procuratorates at all levels have always attached great importance to this issue in recent years. When the state's property, one's own or others' life and property are seriously threatened by criminal activities, the procuratorates, after timely investigation of the facts, have always protected those who have acted in lawful self-defense according to the law. For police officers who, in the course of performing their duties, are seriously threatened by criminals in emergency situations, and who, according to the law, have shot and injured or killed the criminals, the procuratorates have also insisted on providing legal protection.

It is understood that procuratorates at all levels handled more than 40 such cases last year, making decisions not to arrest or prosecute those who acted in lawful self-defense, which had a very good impact on the public.

　　高检负责人要求各级检察机关
    支持公民和公安干警正当防卫
    据新华社北京４月２日电  （实习生杨兴国）最高人民检察院副检察长张思卿今天在接受记者采访时说，各级检察机关要支持公民和公安干警行使正当防卫的权利，保护同犯罪行为作斗争的积极性。张思卿是针对当前社会治安形势严峻的情况说这番话的。
    他说，我国刑法规定，为了使公共利益、本人或者他人的人身和其他权利免受正在进行的不法侵害，而采取的正当防卫行为，不负法律责任。但是，目前有些犯罪分子和犯罪分子的家属对不追究正当防卫的人的法律责任不服，对表彰见义勇为、实施正当防卫不满，有的甚至冲击检察机关。一些地方由于对这类事件处理不力，挫伤了公民和公安干警同犯罪分子作斗争的积极性，在一定程度上助长了犯罪分子的嚣张气焰。
    张思卿认为，正当防卫既是公民的权利，也可以说，是公民的义务。他说，各级检察机关近年来一直比较重视这个问题。对在国家财产、本人或他人的生命财产受到犯罪行为严重威胁的情况下，依法正当防卫的，检察机关及时查清事实之后，均依法予以保护。对公安人员在依法执行公务时受到犯罪分子严重威胁的紧急状况下，依法将犯罪分子击伤、击毙的行为，检察机关也坚持给予法律保护。
    据了解，各级检察机关去年共处理了４０多起这类案件，对正当防卫的人作出不批捕、不起诉的决定，在群众中产生了很好的影响。
