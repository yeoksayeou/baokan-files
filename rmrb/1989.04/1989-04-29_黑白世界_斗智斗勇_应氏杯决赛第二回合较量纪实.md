	At 3:36 PM, the referee counted ten black stones from the board and placed them on the timing table, announcing, “Choi Hyeon-ju, 9-dan, has entered the reading time.” At this moment, Choi 9-dan picked up a black stone and firmly placed it as Black 125, launching the final attack on a large group of white stones.

	This might be considered Choi's "decisive move." Because the territory occupied by the black stones was slightly less than that of the white stones, and there was very little space left on the one-foot-square board for further encirclement.

	The opening of this game was quite interesting: Black played "star," and White also played "star"; Black played "small eye," and White also played "small eye." The first six moves were identical, forming a parallel symmetrical layout. This layout suggested that the game would be a close "small game," aligning with the intention of the player with the white stones to rely on the eight-point compensation.

	Indeed, after both sides followed the standard sequence in the two corners, Choi Hyeon-ju played Black 41, splitting the white stones and starting a dispute. At this point, Nie Weiping, who had been playing as if in a speed game, had to proceed with caution. He spent twenty-five minutes thinking about the 52nd move. After that, both sides used their wits to fight, with black and white stones intertwining and moving, evenly matched.

	At this point, Choi Hyeon-ju realized that if he continued this way, the black stones would not be enough to compensate. So, on the 65th move, he stepped onto the "heavenly center," then jumped and flew, trying to encircle a large area in the middle, reenacting his winning strategy from the previous game. But in a high-level confrontation, it is extremely difficult for either side to gain a complete advantage. Choi 9-dan was overwhelmed, and the large area he barely encircled had many "leaks." An expert commented that it was a "lantern space," with even a small hole letting in light. Sure enough, Nie Weiping saw the opportunity and, on the 106th move, turned his head to break the space. The black stones immediately lost their luster, and the actual territory was clearly insufficient.

	Under the impact of Choi 9-dan's 125th move, Nie Weiping responded correctly, defusing the killing move. By the 138th move, he had already established a winning position.

　　黑白世界　斗智斗勇   
    ——应氏杯决赛第二回合较量纪实
    下午三点三十六分，裁判员从棋盘中数出十枚黑子，排在计时桌上宣布：“曹薰铉九段进入读秒”。就在这时，曹九段拈起一颗黑子，重重地拍下了黑１２５手，向一大块白棋发起了最后攻击。
    这也许可以算做曹的“胜负手”。因为黑棋所占据的地盘略逊于白子，而一尺见方的棋盘上，可供围占的余地已经所剩无几。
    这盘棋的开局颇为有趣：黑走“星”，白也走“星”；黑“小目”，白也“小目”，前六招棋两人一模一样，形成平行对称布局。这种布局预示着将形成双方差别微小的“细棋”，显示符合有对方贴还八点依恃的执白者的意图。
    果然，在两个角部双方依定式进行演变之后，曹薰铉“啪”地打下黑４１，分断了白棋，挑起争端。这时，开盘以来一直如同下快棋般的聂卫平不得不谨慎从事了，他为第５２手而思索了二十五分钟。此后两人各逞心机斗法，黑白子边缠边走，势均力敌。
    这时曹薰铉意识到，如此下去黑棋势必不够贴子，于是他在第６５步踏上“天元”，然后连跳带飞，试图在中腹围起大空，重演上盘取胜的拿手好戏。但高手相搏，任何一方想占尽上风都极为困难。曹九段顾此失彼，勉强围起的大空多处“露风”。一位行家评之为“灯笼空”，有针眼大的洞也会露出光来。果然，聂卫平觑住机会，于１０６手拐头破空，黑棋顿时黯然失色，实地明显不足了。
    在曹九段的第１２５手棋冲击下，聂卫平应对无误，化解了杀着，至１３８手时已经确立了胜势。
