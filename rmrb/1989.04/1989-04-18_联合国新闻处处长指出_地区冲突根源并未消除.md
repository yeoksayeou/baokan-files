The head of the United Nations Department of Public Information, Teresita G. Schaffer, said at an international symposium held in Poland that although the international situation has significantly eased over the past two years, the roots of regional conflicts have not been eliminated, and the international community still faces "common challenges and dangers."

The international symposium on "The United Nations, Mass Media, and Public Opinion" was held from April 13 to 16 in the city of Rytro near Krakow, Poland. Teresita G. Schaffer said that the world continues to face threats from "the proliferation of nuclear and conventional weapons," "persistent political disputes," "widespread poverty," and "severe environmental pollution." The international situation remains "complex and fraught with danger."

Teresita G. Schaffer, in her speech, called on countries to report objectively and comprehensively on the United Nations' efforts to eliminate regional conflicts and "hotspots," while also truthfully reflecting the international situation.

The international symposium on "The United Nations, Mass Media, and Public Opinion" was jointly organized by the World Federation of United Nations Associations and the Polish United Nations Association. Representatives from the United Nations associations, scholars, and journalists from 14 countries, including Poland, China, the United States, and the Soviet Union, participated in the symposium.

Participants focused on discussing how media outlets in various countries can strengthen their reporting on United Nations activities and news freedom. They also exchanged views on establishing a new international news order. Many representatives suggested drafting an international news law based on the news laws of various countries.
