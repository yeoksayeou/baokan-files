Shanghai has seen the emergence of a women's boxing team. The "Dàshìjiè Women's Boxing Team," organized by the Shanghai Dàshìjiè Amusement Center, is the first of its kind in China.

Several months ago, "Dàshìjiè" put up a notice to recruit female amateur boxers, attracting many young women to sign up. The current 16 team members, with an average age of 27, come from universities, the military, shops, and research institutions. Among them, 6 are college students. After several months of training, these young women have begun to show their prowess on the "Dàshìjiè" boxing ring.

　　上海出现一支女子拳击队
    新华社上海４月２６日电（通讯员茹炳祥、记者严卫民）给人娇弱印象的上海姑娘，如今也迷上了拳击运动。由上海大世界游乐中心组建的“大世界女子拳击队”，成为我国第一支拳坛娘子军。
    几个月前，“大世界”尝试性地张榜招收女子业余拳击手，引来不少姑娘报名。目前的１６名队员，平均年龄为２７岁，来自高校、部队、商店和科研单位等。其中有６名是大学生。经过几个月的训练，这些姑娘已在“大世界”拳坛上初试锋芒。
