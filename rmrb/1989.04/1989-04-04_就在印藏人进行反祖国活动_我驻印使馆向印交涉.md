Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 3rd.

	While Tibetan separatists in India were engaging in anti-national activities, our embassy in India lodged a protest.

	On April 3rd, the Chinese Embassy in India lodged a protest with the Indian Ministry of External Affairs regarding the incident where Tibetan separatists in India gathered in front of the Chinese Embassy and caused a disturbance. The embassy hoped that the Indian government would honor its commitments and prevent Tibetan separatists in India from engaging in any political activities against China on Indian soil.

	On April 1st, over 40 Tibetan separatists gathered in front of the Chinese Embassy in India and caused a disturbance. They waved the "Snow Lion Flag," shouted anti-national slogans, and a few of them threw bricks at the embassy gate, damaging the copper plaque and breaking the glass windows of the guardhouse. They also threw bricks into the embassy compound. The disturbance lasted for about an hour. More than 10 police officers present did not take effective measures to stop the incident.

	Today, Deputy Chief of Mission Zhou Xingxing met with Joint Secretary of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs Naveen Jha. Zhou expressed concern over the incident and hoped that the Indian side would take concrete actions to honor its commitments, prevent similar incidents from happening again, and ensure the safety and normal operations of the Chinese Embassy.

	Zhou pointed out that the nature of this incident is very serious and it is not conducive to the overall improvement of Sino-Indian relations.

	Naveen Jha said that the occurrence of this incident is unfortunate. He reiterated that the Indian government's position is that Tibet is an autonomous region of China and it does not allow Tibetan separatists in India to engage in any political activities against China. This policy has not changed.

　　就在印藏人进行反祖国活动
    我驻印使馆向印交涉
    新华社新德里４月３日电  中国驻印度大使馆３日就在印的藏人到中国使馆门前闹事向印度外交部提出交涉，希望印度政府履行它的诺言，不允许在印度的西藏人在印度领土上从事任何反对中国的政治活动。
    ４月１日，４０多名西藏人在中国驻印使馆大门前闹事。他们打着“雪山狮子旗”，呼喊反对祖国的口号，其中少数人用砖块猛砸使馆大门，砸坏门上铜牌，砸碎门房窗户玻璃，并向使馆院内投掷砖块。骚动持续一个小时。在场的１０多名警察未采取有效措施加以制止。
    中国使馆参赞周兴兴今天会见印度外交部联合秘书南威哲表示，中国对上述事件表示关切，望印方以实际行动履行诺言，防止再次发生类似事件，保证中国使馆安全和正常对外活动。
    周兴兴指出，这次事件性质很严重，它不利于改善中印关系的大局。
    南威哲说，发生这次事件是不幸的。他重申，印度政府的立场是西藏是中国的一个自治区，它不允许在印藏人从事任何反对中国的政治活动，这个政策没有改变。
