Hainan Province Cracks Down on Evil Phenomena
Over 6,000 Criminals Arrested, Public Security Significantly Stabilized

HAIKOU, April 27 (Xinhua) — In its fight against criminal elements, Hainan Province has effectively combined crackdowns, shutdowns, rectification, education, and management. This approach has ensured continuous anti-crime operations, unrelenting efforts to eradicate evil phenomena, and sustained strengthening of management. As a result, the province has curbed the arrogance of criminal activities and stabilized social order.

In the year since Hainan became a province, it has experienced unprecedented enthusiasm for talent, investment, and tourism. However, criminal elements have taken advantage of this situation, leading to a surge in criminal cases. Over the past year, the province has conducted several rounds of unified crackdowns, arresting 6,905 criminals, dismantling 664 major criminal gangs, and solving 4,107 criminal cases, including 1,306 major and serious cases. Additionally, the province has inspected and rectified 1,715 hotels, guesthouses, rental houses, roadside shops, and massage centers, and dismantled 57 brothels.

The broad masses of cadres and people in Hainan, inspired by legal education and unified crackdowns, have begun to overcome their doubts and actively participate in the fight against criminal elements. They have apprehended 1,963 lawbreakers, solved 476 criminal cases, and handled 917 public security incidents. The public has provided 3,348 tips on lawbreaking activities. Temporary residence permits have been issued to 3,630 individuals, stabilizing social order. According to Meng Jincang, Director of the Hainan Provincial Public Security Bureau, although Hainan has not yet achieved complete safety, the overall public security situation has significantly improved. The number of criminal cases in February this year has shown a downward trend.
