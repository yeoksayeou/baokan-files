Nuclear fusion energy is hailed by scientists as the "sun on Earth." For many years, developed countries have been competing to research and develop nuclear fusion technology, one of the leading fields of contemporary high technology.

**Major Advances**

To achieve controlled thermonuclear fusion, three necessary conditions for a critical plasma must be created: heating deuterium and other light elements to ultra-high temperatures of 100 million to 200 million degrees Celsius, achieving a neutron density of 500 trillion particles per cubic centimeter, and maintaining energy confinement for more than one second. There are several methods to achieve nuclear fusion, such as laser control and electron beam control. Among these, the "Tokamak" type magnetic confinement device is particularly noteworthy, as it has made significant progress in achieving these three conditions.

As early as 1986, the massive Tokamak fusion reactor (TFTR) in the United States produced a record-breaking temperature of 200 million degrees Celsius (equivalent to ten times the temperature at the center of the sun), thus meeting the energy requirements for commercial replacement of nuclear power. The U.S. Department of Energy considered this a "significant milestone" in the development of fusion energy.

At the end of last year, the Soviet Union's thermonuclear device "Tokamak-15" was launched. According to the Soviet "Izvestia," this device occupies several buildings, weighs 1,500 tons, and is a culmination of multiple cutting-edge technologies. Its plasma temperature will reach 100 million degrees Celsius, with sufficient density to maintain the stability of the thermonuclear fusion reaction. Soviet scientists believe that this thermonuclear device is moving towards a practical reactor.

The Joint European Torus (JET) is an improved Tokamak type, and it has already been able to create the three necessary conditions for nuclear fusion to occur. According to a report from the Japanese "Science News" in January of this year, JET has reached a temperature of 150 million degrees Celsius, an energy confinement time of 1.2 seconds, and particle density has reached the desired level. The European Community announced that it has taken the lead in the world in the field of thermonuclear fusion.

Japan formulated a nuclear fusion development strategy in 1982. Its Tokamak-type fusion device, "JT-60," uses a "high-frequency heating" device that heats plasma through electromagnetic waves, solving the problem of continuous operation over short periods.

**Joint Research Efforts**

It is believed that the main technical challenges facing nuclear fusion research are the difficulty in maintaining the high temperatures achieved by fusion devices and the simultaneous achievement of the three necessary conditions to the desired extent, coupled with the enormous cost. Therefore, international cooperation is needed for research and development. During the Geneva talks in 1985, former U.S. President Reagan and Soviet leader Gorbachev proposed the idea of joint research by various countries. After more than two years of preparation, the "International Controlled Thermonuclear Test Group," consisting of the United States, the Soviet Union, the European Community, and Japan, decided to implement a joint plan to build a nuclear fusion reactor.

The first phase of the cooperation plan (1988) saw the four parties reach an agreement on parameters such as plasma current, plasma chamber size, and coil size; the second phase (1989) expanded the research scope of parameters and analyzed the device, formulating a conceptual design, cost estimate, and site selection conditions; the third phase (1990) involved the overall design of the experimental reactor and necessary research and development. Based on this, the "International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor" will be constructed in 1993, which will be larger than any nuclear fusion reactor attempted by any single country. The joint research center is located in Garching near Munich, Germany. The next few years will be a critical period for controlled nuclear fusion research.

**Room Temperature Nuclear Fusion**

Two professors at the University of Utah took a unique approach and achieved a major breakthrough in realizing nuclear fusion at room temperature. Since the announcement of this achievement on March 23, scientists from Hungary, Poland, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Brazil have also announced that they have successfully achieved nuclear fusion under room temperature conditions. Currently, Moscow University is planning to conduct extensive basic research on this new phenomenon. The state of Utah quickly allocated $50 million to support research on room temperature nuclear fusion. The Italian Minister of Scientific Research emphasized that the room temperature nuclear fusion experiment will be given "top priority."

Additionally, there have been advances in low-temperature experiments. Scientists have improved room temperature nuclear fusion experiments, with Italy achieving nuclear fusion at -150 degrees Celsius, and the German Democratic Republic also achieving nuclear fusion at low temperatures.

Currently, in the field of nuclear fusion research, scientists are taking multiple approaches. Although room temperature nuclear fusion is still far from practical application, it is hailed as the "sun in a test tube," a significant breakthrough. Scientists believe that this achievement opens the door to obtaining low-cost nuclear energy. If nuclear fusion is realized, the energy extracted from the vast oceans will be sufficient for human use for hundreds of billions of years.

　　核聚变研究攻坚战
    张友新
    核聚变能被科学家誉为“地球上的太阳”。多年来，发达国家竞相研究开发核聚变技术——当代高科技领域之一。
    重大进展
    为实现受控热核聚变，必须创造临界等离子体的３个必要条件：把氘和氘等轻元素加热到１亿至２亿摄氏度的超高温，使中子密度达到１立方厘米５０万亿个，使能量约束时间达到１秒以上。实现核聚变有多种方法，如激光受控、电子束受控等，其中“托卡马克”型磁场约束装置尤为引人注目，它在实现这３个条件方面取得了重大进展。
    早在１９８６年，美国普林斯顿巨大的托卡马克聚变反应堆（ＴＦＴＲ）就产生了２亿摄氏度的创纪录的高温（相当于太阳中心温度的１０倍），从而达到在商业上可代替核动力所需的能量。美国能源部认为，这是开发聚变能的“重要里程碑”。
    去年底，苏联热核装置“托卡马克—１５”启动。据苏联《消息报》报道，该装置占几座建筑物，１５００吨重，是多项尖端技术成就的结晶；其等离子体的温度将为１亿摄氏度，密度足够保持热核聚变反应的稳定性。苏联科学家认为，这个热核装置正在向实用的反应堆迈进。
    欧洲联合环形装置（ＪＥＴ）是经过改良的托卡马克型，它已经能够创造发生核聚变的３个必要条件。据日本《科学新闻》今年１月报道，ＪＥＴ温度已经达到１．５亿摄氏度，能量约束时间达到１．２秒，粒子也达到了希望的密度。欧共体宣布：它在热核聚变方面已居世界领先地位。
    日本于１９８２年制定了核聚变开发战略，其托卡马克型聚变装置“ＪＴ—６０”的“高频加热”装置是通过电磁波加热等离子的，用这种方法攻下了在短时间内连续运转的难题。
    联合攻关
    据认为，核聚变研究面临的主要技术难题是，核聚变装置获得的高温难以保持，前述的３个必要条件难以同时达到希望的程度，加上耗资巨大，因此需要各国携手研究开发。美国前总统里根和苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫在１９８５年日内瓦会谈中提出了各国联合研究的设想。经过２年多的酝酿和准备，由美国、苏联、欧共体和日本组成的“国际受控热核试验集团”，决定实施联合建造核聚变反应堆计划。
    合作计划的第一阶段（１９８８年），４方就等离子体电流、等离子体室和线圈大小等参数达成协议；第二阶段（１９８９年），扩大参数的研究范围和对装置进行分析，制定出一套概念设计、造价估计和选址条件；第三阶段（１９９０年），进行实验堆的总体设计和必要的研究和开发。然后在此基础上于１９９３年建造“国际热核试验反应堆”，它将比任何国家试图建造的核聚变反应堆都大。联合研究中心设在联邦德国慕尼黑附近的加尔兴。今后几年将是受控核聚变研究的关键时期。
    室温核聚变
    美国犹他大学两位教授独辟蹊径，取得了在室温条件下实现核聚变的重大突破。自３月２３日公布这一成果之后，匈牙利、波兰、苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和巴西等国的科学家分别宣布，他们也成功地实现了室温条件下的核聚变。目前，莫斯科大学将全面铺开对这一新现象进行基础研究的广泛计划。美国犹他州迅速拨款５００万美元，支持室温核聚变的研究。意大利科研部长强调将把室温核聚变试验置于“最优先的地位”。
    另外，低温试验有进展。科学家在改进室温核聚变的试验中，意大利在零下１５０摄氏度实现了核聚变，民主德国也在低温下实现了核聚变。
    眼下，在核聚变研究领域，科学家们兵分几路攻核聚变。尽管室温核聚变距实用化的目标还有漫长的路程，却被誉为“试管中的太阳”，是个突破。科学家认为，这项成果打开了通往获得低成本核能的大门。如果核聚变实用化，那么从浩瀚海洋中提取的能源足够人类使用几百亿年。（附图片）
