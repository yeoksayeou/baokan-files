The wave of Zimbabwe's independence brought a Chinese woman to the position of a cabinet minister. She is Ms. Ju Huiqiong.

One Sunday morning, I visited this female minister. It was a house in the northern suburbs of Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe. The yard was not large, the grass was green and neatly trimmed. After greeting the guard, I knocked on the door directly. Ms. Huiqiong greeted me with a smile. She was of medium height, dressed in a cotton sports suit, wearing a pair of glasses, looking very energetic, and had the charm of a Guangdong woman. She handed me a glass of fresh orange juice and said warmly, "We can start now."

In the 1940s, Ms. Ju Huiqiong was born in Zimbabwe. After graduating from the University of Rhodesia, she furthered her studies at the University of Leeds in the UK, earning a Master of Arts degree. She had taught at the University of Zambia for four years. In the 1960s, she participated in Zimbabwe's national independence struggle. In the tropical rainforests of Africa, she had written cultural textbooks for soldiers and planned the educational affairs of Zimbabwe after independence. After President Mugabe took office, he selected her to serve as the Minister of Primary and Secondary Education.

Ms. Huiqiong got straight to the point, discussing the current state of Zimbabwe's educational development. In 1980, when Zimbabwe gained independence, there were 2,400 primary schools with approximately 810,000 students. By 1988, the number of primary schools had increased to over 4,000, with 2.7 million students enrolled. The development of secondary education was even more remarkable, with the number of secondary school students increasing from over 60,000 at the time of independence to 720,000, and the number of schools increasing from over 170 to over 1,300.

Zimbabwe is a small country in Africa with a population of less than 10 million. After independence, there were countless tasks and challenges, but none of this hindered Zimbabwe's rapid progress in educational development. Ms. Huiqiong told me, "At the time of independence, we implemented compulsory free primary education. The government attaches great importance to education, with educational funds accounting for 20% of the budget, once reaching 22%, higher than the defense budget. And you know, our army also needs to be built and strengthened." Although the government has made efforts, funds are still insufficient. While the central government increases educational funds, it also mobilizes local finances to support education. Primary and secondary schools have also started to collect a certain amount of tuition fees and implemented a "sponsorship system."

Ms. Huiqiong introduced the "sponsorship system" to me. After independence, most of the expanded schools were located in black towns and rural areas, which are regions with high population density and the lowest educational levels. The "sponsorship system" stipulates that the central government provides the roofing materials for the school buildings (usually more expensive), while the students' parents provide the remaining building materials. Many parents cannot afford to pay, so they cut down building timber, or make bricks, or participate in the construction of the school buildings. This method is quite effective, and many rural schools were established in this way. Now, urban schools have also started to adopt the "sponsorship system." Schools set up school committees composed of parents' representatives to discuss the equipment and facilities that the school needs to add. If the school funds are insufficient, the school committee makes suggestions and asks parents to sponsor, with the amount of sponsorship depending on their willingness. Those who cannot afford it can still "work in lieu of sponsorship."

I jokingly asked, "Zimbabwe is such a small country, with such a large amount of educational funds, is this not a bit 'luxurious'?" Minister Huiqiong laughed heartily and said, "There is a historical background here. Can we afford the 'luxury' of slowly choosing between culture and ignorance? Can we afford the 'luxury' of slowly choosing between backwardness and development?" I knew she had written an article pointing out that the development of a nation depends on the knowledge and skills of that nation, and when lacking such knowledge and skills, the development of the nation becomes a castle in the air.

Educational standards were our final topic. In Zimbabwe, after the second year of middle school, more than ten subjects are offered, such as sociology, philosophy, history, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and English and French languages and literature, among others. Students can choose any of these subjects. Zimbabwe adopts the British examination system, with the Cambridge Examination Committee setting the questions and marking the papers, which is quite strict. Ms. Huiqiong told me that the number of junior high school graduates has increased from 10,000 per year at the time of independence to 45,000 now, and the number of senior high school students has increased from 1,500 to around 5,000, cultivating the urgently needed talents for the country. From the conversation, I learned that there are many private schools of various kinds in Zimbabwe, but the tuition fees are relatively expensive. In addition, the government also runs various vocational training schools, such as crop cultivation, agricultural machinery, automobile repair, and weaving, to solve the problem of youth unemployment.

The scheduled interview time was up, and I stood up to leave. A cool breeze blew in from the window, and rain drops fell. I will never forget that simple house. There, I not only felt the closeness between the Chinese people, but more importantly, I felt the desire of the Zimbabwean people to develop education and the practical spirit of a poor country striving to build schools.

　　一个穷国发展教育的渴望
    ——访津巴布韦初、中级教育部长朱惠琼女士
    李文政
    津巴布韦独立的浪潮把一位华裔女性推上了内阁部长的岗位。她就是朱惠琼女士。
    一个星期天的上午，我访问了这位女部长。那是津巴布韦首都哈拉雷北郊的一座房子。院子不大，草地一碧如洗，剪得整整齐齐。我向卫兵打过招呼，便径直敲响了房门。惠琼女士笑着迎上前来。她身材不高，身穿棉毛运动服，带着副秀郎镜，显得十分精干，颇有我广东女性的风采。她递我一杯鲜桔汁，亲切地说：“我们可以开始了。”
    ４０年代，朱惠琼女士出生在津巴布韦。她从罗得西亚大学毕业之后，又到英国里兹大学深造，获文学硕士学位。她曾在赞比亚大学任教４年。６０年代她参加津巴布韦的民族独立斗争。在非洲的热带雨林里，她曾为战士编写文化课本，并筹划津巴布韦独立后的教育事业。津巴布韦总统穆加贝就任后选中她出任初、中级教育部长。
    惠琼女士开门见山，谈起津巴布韦教育事业的发展现状。１９８０年津巴布韦独立时，小学校有２４００所，在校学生约８１万，到１９８８年，小学校增加到４０００余所，在校学生２７０万。中学教育的发展更令人瞩目，中学生由独立时的６万余人增加到７２万人，学校由１７０余所增加到１３００余所。
    津巴布韦是非洲的一个小国，人口不足千万。独立后的工作千头万绪，任务十分艰巨，可这一切并没有妨碍津巴布韦迅速走上发展教育的道路。惠琼女士告诉我：“独立时我们实行强制性免费小学教育。政府十分重视教育，教育经费占财政预算的２０％，一度达到２２％，比国防预算还高。而你知道，我们的军队也需要建设和加强。”虽然政府下了力气，可经费仍然不足。中央政府在增加教育经费的同时，还动员地方财政支持。中小学也开始收缴一定数量的学费，并实行了一种“认捐制度”。
    惠琼女士向我介绍了“认捐制度”。独立后所扩建的学校大多在黑人城镇和农村，那里是人口密度较高，教育水平最低的地区。“认捐制度”规定，由中央政府提供所盖校舍的屋顶材料（一般较贵），而由学生家长提供剩余建筑材料。很多学生家长无力出钱，就由他们砍伐建筑木材，或烧砖制坯，或参加盖校舍劳动。这种办法相当有效，农村的许多学校大多是靠这种办法建立起来的。现在城里学校也开始采用“认捐制度”。学校里设学校委员会，由家长代表组成，研究学校该增添的设备和设施。学校经费不足，由学校委员会作出建议，请家长认捐，捐多少凭自愿。无钱者依然可以“以工代捐”。
    我开玩笑地问：“津巴布韦这么小一个国家，教育经费如此巨大，这是否有几分‘奢侈’呢？”惠琼部长爽朗地笑着说：“这里有一个历史的背景，难道我们享受得起那种在文化与愚昧之间慢慢选择的‘奢侈’吗？能享受得起在落后与发展之间慢慢选择的‘奢侈’吗？”我知道她曾发表文章指出，一个民族的发展取决于这个民族的知识与技能，当缺乏这种知识与技能时，民族的发展就成了空中楼阁。
    教育水准是我们最后的话题。津巴布韦的中学在二年级之后，就开设十几门课程，如社会学、哲学、历史，数理化，还有英、法语言及文学等等。学生可任意选修，津巴布韦实行英国考试制度，由英国剑桥考试委员会出题判卷，相当严格。惠琼女士告诉我，初中毕业生由独立时的每年１万上升到现在的４．５万，高中生由１５００人上升到５０００人左右，为国家培养了急需的人才。从谈话中得知，津巴布韦各种私立学校甚多，只是学费较为昂贵。此外，政府还举办各类职业训练学校，如农作物栽培、农用机械和汽车修理及编织等等，以解决青年的失业问题。
    约定的采访时间到了，我起身告辞。窗外吹来凉爽的风，飘落着雨点儿。我忘不了那座朴素的房子，在那里，我不仅感受到了炎黄子孙间的亲近感情，更重要的是感受到了津巴布韦人民立志发展教育的渴望和一个穷国励精办学的实干精神。
