Explanation of the Draft of the Administrative Litigation Law of the People's Republic of China

—At the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress on March 28, 1989

Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Director of the Legislative Affairs Commission, Wang Hanbin:

Comrades:

The drafting of the Administrative Litigation Law is a significant event in the construction of China's socialist legal system following the enactment of the Criminal Procedure Law and the Provisional Civil Procedure Law. It is also an important step in the development of China's socialist democratic politics. The Constitution stipulates that citizens have the right to lodge complaints, accusations, or reports against any state organ or state functionary for illegal or derelict acts, and that those who suffer losses due to infringements of their rights by state organs or state functionaries have the right to seek compensation in accordance with the law. The enactment of the Administrative Litigation Law is of great significance for implementing the Constitution and the principles outlined in the report of the Thirteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China to protect the lawful rights and interests of citizens. It is also of great significance for ensuring and promoting the lawful exercise of administrative powers by administrative organs, improving and enhancing administrative work, and for the governance of the economic environment, the rectification of economic order, and the construction of clean government.

China began to establish the administrative litigation system in 1982. The Provisional Civil Procedure Law enacted in 1982 stipulates that people's courts shall accept administrative cases that can be sued as prescribed by law. Currently, more than 130 laws and administrative regulations stipulate that citizens and organizations can sue administrative cases to the people's courts. The Supreme People's Court and local people's courts at various levels have successively established more than 1,400 administrative trial divisions, heard a number of administrative cases, created conditions, and accumulated experience for the drafting of the Administrative Litigation Law.

The Legislative Affairs Commission, at the request of the Standing Committee, organized relevant legal experts in 1986 to study and draft the Administrative Litigation Law. Based on the Constitution, summarizing the experience of courts hearing administrative cases over the past few years, and drawing on and learning from some useful contents of foreign administrative litigation systems, the draft was successively drafted, including a draft for soliciting opinions, a draft for soliciting opinions, and a draft for soliciting opinions. Opinions were widely solicited from courts, procuratorates, relevant central departments, local governments, legal experts, law schools, and research institutions. After research and revision, the draft was submitted to the Fourth Session of the Seventh National People's Congress Standing Committee for deliberation, and it was decided to publish the full text of the draft to solicit opinions widely. A total of more than 130 opinions were received from central departments, local governments, courts, and procuratorates, and more than 300 opinions were directly mailed to the Legislative Affairs Commission by citizens. The National People's Congress Legal Committee, the Internal and Judicial Affairs Committee, and the Legislative Affairs Commission jointly held four seminars with the participation of relevant personnel from courts, procuratorates, State Council departments, democratic parties, and people's organizations, as well as legal experts, to solicit opinions. A special meeting was also held with the participation of more than 80 people, including some provincial and municipal people's congress standing committees, courts at various levels, procuratorates, relevant State Council departments, and legal experts, to discuss and revise the draft article by article. Based on the opinions of the members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and various places and sectors, the Legislative Affairs Commission made many supplements and revisions to the draft, which was deliberated by the Sixth Session of the Seventh National People's Congress Standing Committee and decided to be submitted to the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress for deliberation.

The main contents and issues of the draft are explained as follows:

1. Regarding the Scope of Acceptance

The scope of acceptance of administrative cases by courts is an important issue that the Administrative Litigation Law must first address. The draft regulates this issue based on the following principles: First, based on the Constitution and the spirit of the Thirteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, starting from protecting the lawful rights and interests of citizens, legal persons, and other organizations, appropriately expand the scope of administrative cases currently accepted by people's courts; second, correctly handle the relationship between judicial power and administrative power, people's courts should conduct trials of administrative cases in accordance with the law, but should not interfere with the administrative acts of administrative organs within the scope prescribed by laws and regulations, and should not replace administrative organs in exercising administrative powers, so as to ensure that administrative organs can effectively carry out administrative management in accordance with the law; third, consider the current actual situation in China, the administrative law is not yet perfect, the administrative trial divisions of people's courts are not yet sound, the Administrative Litigation Law stipulates that "citizens can sue officials," there are issues of updating concepts, not being accustomed to, not adapting, and also issues of bearing capacity, therefore the scope of acceptance should not be too broad at present, but should be gradually expanded to facilitate the implementation of the administrative litigation system.

Based on the above principles, the draft stipulates that citizens, legal persons, and other organizations who believe that the specific administrative acts of administrative organs and administrative organ personnel infringe upon their lawful rights and interests have the right to bring a lawsuit to the people's court in accordance with the law. People's courts specifically accept the following administrative cases: (1) those who are dissatisfied with administrative penalties such as detention, fines, revocation of permits and licenses, ordering suspension of production and operation, and confiscation of property; (2) those who are dissatisfied with administrative compulsory measures such as restricting personal freedom or sealing up, detaining, and freezing property; (3) those who believe that administrative organs infringe upon the legally prescribed right to independent operation and lawful contractual operation; (4) those who believe that they meet the statutory conditions for applying for administrative organs to issue permits and licenses, but administrative organs refuse to issue or do not respond; (5) those who apply for administrative organs to perform their statutory duties to protect personal rights and property rights, such as requesting the competent administrative organ to perform the duty to stop the trafficking of women and the looting of property, but the administrative organ refuses to perform or does not respond; (6) those who believe that administrative organs have not issued funeral subsidies in accordance with the law; (7) those who believe that administrative organs illegally require the performance of obligations; (8) those who believe that administrative organs infringe upon other personal rights and property rights. In addition, the draft also stipulates that people's courts accept other administrative cases that laws and regulations stipulate can be sued. These provisions expand the scope of acceptance compared to the current scope of acceptance by people's courts, which is necessary for further protecting the lawful rights and interests of citizens, legal persons, and other organizations.

At the same time, to ensure that administrative organs can effectively exercise administrative powers, the draft stipulates that lawsuits against the following matters shall not be accepted by people's courts: (1) national defense, foreign affairs, and other state acts; (2) administrative regulations, rules, or normative decisions, resolutions, and orders issued by administrative organs; (3) decisions by administrative organs on the rewards, punishments, and appointments of administrative organ personnel; (4) specific administrative acts that laws stipulate shall be finally decided by administrative organs.

2. Regarding the Basic Principles of Administrative Litigation

The draft regulates the basic principles of administrative litigation as follows: First, people's courts shall independently exercise judicial power over administrative cases in accordance with the law, without interference from administrative organs, social organizations, or individuals. This is the basic principle stipulated by the Constitution for people's courts to exercise judicial power, which should be emphasized for the trial of administrative cases. Second, people's courts shall try administrative cases based on facts and in accordance with the law. Third, people's courts shall review the legality of specific administrative acts in trying administrative cases. As for whether the specific administrative acts made by administrative organs within the scope prescribed by laws and regulations are appropriate, they should generally be handled by administrative reconsideration, and people's courts cannot replace administrative organs in making decisions. Fourth, people's courts shall try administrative cases in accordance with the law, implementing the collegiate bench system, recusal system, open trial system, and two-instance final trial system. Since the trial of administrative cases is relatively difficult, the draft stipulates that people's courts shall try administrative cases by forming a collegiate bench composed of judges, or by forming a collegiate bench composed of judges and lay assessors, and shall not apply the provision of the Provisional Civil Procedure Law that "simple civil cases shall be tried by a single judge." Fifth, the parties in administrative litigation have equal legal status and the right to debate. Sixth, people's procuratorates have the right to supervise administrative litigation in accordance with the law. People's procuratorates have the right to bring a protest against the judgments and rulings of people's courts that have taken legal effect, if they find that they violate legal provisions, in accordance with the judicial supervision procedure. Regarding how people's procuratorates can further supervise administrative litigation, there are still some differing opinions at present, and it is difficult to make specific provisions, which need to be further studied and explored in future practice.

3. Regarding Jurisdiction

The draft regulates jurisdiction based on the principles of convenience for citizens, legal persons, and other organizations to bring lawsuits, convenience for people's courts to try and enforce judgments, and fairness in trying administrative cases, as follows: First, level jurisdiction. First-instance cases are generally under the jurisdiction of basic people's courts. Cases involving the recognition of patent rights, cases handled by customs, cases against specific administrative acts of the State Council departments and the people's governments of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, and major and complex cases within the jurisdiction are under the jurisdiction of intermediate people's courts. Second, territorial jurisdiction. Administrative cases are generally under the jurisdiction of the people's court where the administrative organ that first made the specific administrative act is located. In cases where a reconsideration has been made, if the reconsideration organ decides to uphold the original specific administrative act, it is under the jurisdiction of the people's court where the administrative organ that made the original specific administrative act is located; if the reconsideration organ changes the original specific administrative act, it can also be under the jurisdiction of the people's court where the reconsideration organ is located. At the same time, the draft regulates special jurisdiction, and lawsuits against administrative compulsory measures that restrict personal freedom are under the jurisdiction of the people's court where the defendant or the plaintiff is located. Administrative lawsuits involving immovable property are under the jurisdiction of the people's court where the immovable property is located.

4. Regarding Acceptance and Trial

To protect the right of citizens, legal persons, or other organizations to bring lawsuits and to avoid and prevent courts from not accepting cases that should be accepted, the draft stipulates that people's courts shall, within 7 days of receiving a complaint, either accept the case or make a ruling not to accept it. The plaintiff may appeal to the higher people's court if they are dissatisfied with the ruling.

To clarify the basis for people's courts to determine the legality of specific administrative acts, the draft stipulates: First, people's courts shall try administrative cases based on laws and administrative regulations, local regulations. Local regulations are applicable to administrative cases that occur within the administrative area. Second, people's courts shall try administrative cases by referring to the rules and regulations formulated and issued by the ministries and commissions of the State Council based on laws and administrative regulations, decisions, and orders of the State Council, as well as the rules and regulations formulated and issued by the people's governments of provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and the municipalities where the people's governments of provinces and autonomous regions are located, and the municipalities approved by the State Council as larger municipalities, based on laws and administrative regulations of the State Council. There are still differing opinions on whether rules and regulations can be used as the basis for people's courts to try administrative cases. Some believe they should be used as the basis, while others believe they should not be used as the basis, and only laws, administrative regulations, and local regulations should be used as the basis. We consider that the Constitution and relevant laws stipulate that the ministries and commissions of the State Council and the people's governments of provinces and municipalities have the power to formulate rules and regulations in accordance with the law, and administrative organs have the power to exercise their powers based on rules and regulations. However, the status and effect of rules and regulations are not exactly the same as those of laws and regulations, and some rules and regulations still have some problems. Therefore, the draft stipulates that courts shall refer to the provisions of rules and regulations when trying administrative cases, which is a consideration of the above two differing opinions. For rules and regulations that comply with the provisions of laws and administrative regulations, courts shall refer to them for trial, and for rules and regulations that do not comply with or do not fully comply with the principles and spirit of laws and administrative regulations, courts shall have the flexibility to handle them.

The draft stipulates that people's courts shall, based on different situations, make the following judgments on administrative cases: First, if the specific administrative act is supported by sufficient evidence and the application of laws and regulations is correct, the judgment shall be to uphold it. If there is an error in the citation of specific laws and regulations, it shall be corrected. Second, if the specific administrative act has any of the following circumstances, the judgment shall be to revoke or partially revoke it, and the defendant may be ordered to change the original specific administrative act: 1. The main evidence is insufficient; 2. The application of laws and regulations is incorrect; 3. The legal procedure is violated; 4. The power is exceeded; 5. The power is abused. Third, if the defendant fails to perform or delays the performance of statutory duties, the judgment shall be to order the performance within a certain period. Fourth, if the administrative penalty is obviously unfair, it may be changed. As for whether the administrative penalty is light or heavy within the scope prescribed by laws and regulations, people's courts cannot change the judgment. To prevent some administrative organs from not changing the original specific administrative act in accordance with the judgment of people's courts, resulting in the plaintiff's rights not being protected, the draft also stipulates that if people's courts judge that the defendant shall change the original specific administrative act, the defendant shall not make a specific administrative act that is basically the same as the original specific administrative act based on the same facts and reasons.

5. Regarding Enforcement

To ensure that the judgments and rulings of people's courts on administrative cases can be effectively enforced, the draft stipulates that if administrative organs refuse to enforce judgments and rulings, courts may take the following measures:

First, for fines that should be refunded or compensation that should be paid, notify the bank to transfer from the account of the administrative organ.

Second, if the administrative organ does not perform within the prescribed period, impose a fine of fifty to one hundred yuan per day on the administrative organ from the date of expiration.

Third, propose judicial recommendations to the superior administrative organ or the supervisory or personnel organ of the administrative organ.

Fourth, if the administrative organ refuses to enforce the judgment and ruling, and the circumstances are serious, constituting a crime, the person in charge and the person directly responsible shall be held criminally liable in accordance with the law. At the same time, to ensure that administrative organs can effectively exercise administrative management powers, the draft stipulates that if citizens, legal persons, or other organizations do not bring a lawsuit or perform within the statutory period for specific administrative acts, administrative organs may apply to people's courts for compulsory enforcement, or administrative organs may enforce in accordance with the law.

6. Regarding Compensation for Infringement

One of the purposes of establishing the administrative litigation system is to compensate for the lawful rights and interests of citizens, legal persons, and other organizations that have been infringed upon by administrative organs or administrative organ personnel. If the issue of compensation is not resolved, some judgments of people's courts cannot be enforced, and the lawful rights and interests of citizens, legal persons, and other organizations that have been infringed upon cannot be restored and compensated, and the purpose of establishing the administrative litigation system cannot be achieved. Therefore, the draft stipulates: First, if the lawful rights and interests of citizens, legal persons, or other organizations are infringed upon by specific administrative acts of administrative organs or administrative organ personnel, causing damage, they have the right to seek compensation. If a request for compensation for damage is made separately, it shall be handled by the administrative organ first. If the handling by the administrative organ is not accepted, a lawsuit may be brought to the people's court. Second, if the specific administrative acts of administrative organs or administrative organ personnel infringe upon the lawful rights and interests of citizens, legal persons, or other organizations, causing damage, the administrative organ or the administrative organ where the administrative organ personnel is located shall be responsible for compensation. After the administrative organ compensates for the loss, it shall order the administrative organ personnel who acted intentionally or with gross negligence to bear part or all of the compensation fees. If an administrative sanction is required, an administrative sanction shall be given; if a crime is constituted, criminal liability shall be pursued in accordance with the law. As for the personal acts of administrative organ personnel that are unrelated to the performance of duties and infringe upon the lawful rights and interests of citizens, legal persons, or other organizations, they do not fall within the scope of administrative litigation, and administrative organs shall not be responsible. Third, the compensation fees shall be listed in the budget of various levels of finance. Various levels of people's governments may order the administrative organs responsible to pay part or all of the compensation fees. The specific measures shall be formulated by the State Council.

Here, it should be noted that the draft suggests that after the Administrative Litigation Law is enacted, it shall come into force on April 1, 1990. Before the implementation of this law, the scope of acceptance of administrative cases by people's courts and the litigation procedures shall still be subject to the relevant provisions of the Provisional Civil Procedure Law.

Whether the draft of the Administrative Litigation Law and the above explanation are appropriate, please deliberate at the conference.

    关于《中华人民共和国行政诉讼法（草案）》的说明
    ——1989年3月28日在第七届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上
    全国人大常委会副委员长　法制工作委员会主任　王汉斌各位代表：
      制定行政诉讼法，是刑事诉讼法、民事诉讼法（试行）制定之后，我国社会主义法制建设的一件大事，也是我国社会主义民主政治建设的一个重要步骤。宪法规定，公民“对于任何国家机关和国家工作人员的违法失职行为，有向有关国家机关提出申诉、控告或者检举的权利”，“由于国家机关和国家工作人员侵犯公民权利而受到损失的人，有依照法律规定取得赔偿的权利”。行政诉讼法的制定，对于贯彻执行宪法和党的十三大报告提出的保障公民合法权益的原则，对于维护和促进行政机关依法行使行政职权，改进和提高行政工作，都有重要的积极的意义，对于治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序和廉政建设也有积极的促进作用。
      我国于1982年开始建立行政诉讼制度。1982年制定的民事诉讼法（试行）规定，人民法院受理法律规定可以起诉的行政案件。现在，已有130多个法律和行政法规规定了公民、组织对行政案件可以向人民法院起诉。最高人民法院和地方各级人民法院陆续建立了1400多个行政审判庭，审理了不少行政案件，为制定行政诉讼法创造了条件，积累了经验。
      法制工作委员会受委员长会议的委托，于1986年组织有关法律专家研究和起草行政诉讼法。根据宪法，总结几年来法院审理行政案件的经验，并参考、借鉴外国行政诉讼制度的一些有用的内容，先后拟订了草案试拟稿、草案征求意见稿，广泛征求各级法院、检察院、中央有关部门、各地方和法律专家、法律院系、研究单位的意见，经过研究修改，将草案提请七届全国人大常委会四次会议审议，决定将草案全文公布，广泛征求意见。现共收到中央各部门、各地方和法院、检察院的意见130多份，公民直接寄送法制工作委员会的意见300多份。全国人大法律委员会、内务司法委员会和法制工作委员会联合召开了有法院、检察院、国务院有关部门、民主党派和人民团体负责人以及法律专家参加的四次座谈会征求意见，并召开了有部分省、市人大常委会、各级法院、检察院、国务院有关部门和法律专家80多人参加的专门会议，对草案逐条进行讨论修改。根据全国人大常委会委员和各地方、各方面的意见，法制工作委员会对草案作了较多的补充、修改，经七届全国人大常委会六次会议审议，决定提请七届全国人大二次会议审议。
      现将草案的主要内容和问题说明如下：
      一、关于受案范围
      法院受理行政案件的范围，是行政诉讼法首先要解决的重要问题。对于这个问题，草案是根据以下原则规定的：第一，根据宪法和党的十三大的精神，从保障公民、法人和其他组织的合法权益出发，适当扩大人民法院现行受理行政案件的范围；第二，正确处理审判权和行政权的关系，人民法院对行政案件应当依法进行审理，但不要对行政机关在法律、法规规定范围内的行政行为进行干预，不要代替行政机关行使行政权力，以保障行政机关依法有效地进行行政管理；第三，考虑我国目前的实际情况，行政法还不完备，人民法院行政审判庭还不够健全，行政诉讼法规定“民可以告官”，有观念更新问题，有不习惯、不适应的问题，也有承受力的问题，因此对受案范围现在还不宜规定太宽，而应逐步扩大，以利于行政诉讼制度的推行。
      根据以上原则，草案规定，公民、法人和其他组织认为行政机关和行政机关工作人员的具体行政行为侵犯其合法权益的，有权依法向人民法院提起诉讼。人民法院具体受理下列行政案件：（一）对拘留、罚款、吊销许可证和执照、责令停产停业、没收财物等行政处罚不服的；（二）对限制人身自由或者对查封、扣押、冻结财产的行政强制措施不服的；（三）认为行政机关侵犯法律规定的经营自主权和合法的承包经营权的；（四）认为符合法定条件申请行政机关颁发许可证和执照，行政机关拒绝颁发或者不予答复的；（五）申请行政机关履行保  护人身权、财产权的法定职责，如请求主管行政机关履行制止拐卖妇女、制止哄抢财产等职责，行政机关拒绝履行或者不予答复的；（六）认为行政机关没有依法发给抚恤金的；（七）认为行政机关违法要求履行义务的；（八）认为行政机关侵犯其他人身权、财产权的。此外，草案还规定人民法院受理法律、法规规定可以提起诉讼的其他行政案件。这些规定比人民法院现行的受案范围有所扩大，对进一步保障公民、法人和其他组织的合法权益是必要的。
      同时，为了保障行政机关有效地行使行政职权，草案规定，
  对下列事项提起诉讼的，人民法院不予受理：（一）国防、外
  交等国家行为；（二）行政法规、规章或者行政机关制定、发布的规范性的决定、决议、命令；（三）行政机关对行政机关
  工作人员的奖惩、任免等决定；（四）法律规定由行政机关最
  终裁决的具体行政行为。
      二、关于行政诉讼的基本原则
      草案对行政诉讼的基本原则作了如下规定：第一，人民法
  院依法对行政案件独立行使审判权，不受行政机关、社会团体和个人的干涉。这是宪法规定的人民法院行使审判权的基本原则，对审理行政案件更应当予以强调。第二，人民法院审理行政案件，以事实为根据，以法律为准绳。第三，人民法院审理行政案件，是对具体行政行为是否合法进行审查。至于行政机关在法律、法规规定范围内作出的具体行政行为是否适当，原则上应由行政复议处理，人民法院不能代替行政机关作出决定。第四，人民法院审理行政案件，依法实行合议、回避、公开审判和两审终审制度。由于行政案件审理难度较大，草案规定，人民法院审理行政案件，由审判员组成合议庭，或者由审判员、陪审员组成合议庭，不适用民事诉讼法（试行）关于“简单的民事案件，由审判员一人独任审判”的规定。第五，当事人在行政诉讼中的法律地位平等，有权进行辩论。第六，人民检察院有权对行政诉讼实行法律监督。人民检察院对人民法院已经发生法律效力的判决、裁定，如果发现有违反法律规定的，有权依照审判监督程序提出抗诉。关于人民检察院在行政诉讼中如何进一步实行法律监督问题，现在还有一些不同意见，难以作出具体规定，需要在今后的实践中进一步研究和探索。
    三、关于管辖
    草案根据便利公民、法人和其他组织进行诉讼，便利人民法院审理和判决的执行，以及有利于公正审理行政案件的原则，对管辖作了以下规定：第一，级别管辖。第一审案件一般由基层人民法院管辖，专业性较强的确认发明专利权的案件、海关处理的案件，对国务院各部门和省、自治区、直辖市人民政府所作的具体行政行为提起诉讼的案件，以及本辖区内重大、复杂的案件，由中级人民法院管辖。第二，地域管辖。行政案件一般由最初作出具体行政行为的行政机关所在地人民法院管辖。经复议的案件，复议机关决定维持原具体行政行为的，由作出原具体行政行为的行政机关所在地人民法院管辖；复议机关改变原具体行政行为的，也可以由复议机关所在地人民法院管辖。同时草案对特别管辖作了规定，对限制人身自由的行政强制措施不服而提起的诉讼，由被告所在地或者原告所在地人民法院管辖。因不动产提起的行政诉讼，由不动产所在地人民法院管辖。
    四、关于受理和审判
    为了保护公民、法人或者其他组织提起诉讼的权利，避免和防止法院对有的该受理的案件不予受理，草案规定，人民法院接到起诉状，经审查，应当在7日内立案或者作出裁定不予受理。原告对裁定不服的，可以向上一级人民法院上诉。
    为了明确人民法院认定具体行政行为合法性的依据，草案规定：第一，人民法院审理行政案件，以法律和行政法规、地方性法规为依据。地方性法规适用于本行政区域内发生的行政案件。第二，人民法院审理行政案件，参照国务院部、委根据法律和国务院的行政法规、决定、命令制定、发布的规章，以及省、自治区、直辖市和省、自治区的人民政府所在地的市、经国务院批准的较大的市的人民政府根据法律和国务院的行政法规制定、发布的规章。现在对规章是否可以作为法院审理行政案件的依据仍有不同意见，有的认为应该作为依据，有的认为不能作为依据，只能以法律、行政法规和地方性法规作为依据。我们考虑，宪法和有关法律规定国务院各部委和省、市人
  民政府有权依法制定规章，行政机关有权依据规章行使职权。但是，规章与法律、法规的地位和效力不完全相同，有的规章还存在一些问题。因此，草案规定法院在审理行政案件时，参照规章的规定，是考虑了上述两种不同的意见，对符合法律、行政法规规定的规章，法院要参照审理，对不符合或不完全符合法律、行政法规原则精神的规章，法院可以有灵活处理的余地。
      草案规定，人民法院对行政案件的审理，应该根据不同情况，分别作出以下判决：第一，具体行政行为证据确凿，适用法律、法规正确的，判决维持。具体行政行为引用具体法律、法规条文有失误的，予以补正。第二，具体行政行为有下列情形之一的，判决撤销或者部分撤销，并可以判决被告改变原具体行政行为：1．主要证据不足的；2．适用法律、法规错误的；3．违反法定程序的；4．超越职权的；5．滥用职权的。第三，被告不履行或者拖延履行法定职责的，判决其在一定期限内履行。第四，行政处罚显失公正的，可以判决变更。至于行政机关在法律、法规规定范围内作出的行政处罚轻一些或者重一些的问题，人民法院不能判决改变。为了防止有的行政机关不按照人民法院的判决改变原具体行政行为，致使原告的权利得不到保护，草案同时规定，人民法院判决被告改变原具体行政行为的，被告不得以同一的事实和理由作出与原具体行政行为基本相同的具体行政行为。
      五、关于执行
      为使人民法院对行政案件的判决、裁定能够得到切实执行，草案规定，行政机关拒绝履行判决、裁定的，法院可以采取以下措施：
    第一，对应当归还的罚款或者应当给付的赔偿金，通知银行从该行政机关的帐户内划拨。
      第二，在规定期限内不履行的，从期满之日起，对该行政机关按日处五十元至一百元的罚款。第三，向该行政机关的上一级行政机关或者监察、人事机关提出司法建议。第四，拒不履行判决、裁定，情节严重构成犯罪的，依法追究主管人员和直接责任人员的刑事责任。同时，为了保障行政机关有效地行使行政管理职权，草案规定，公民、法人或其他组织对具体行政行为在法定期限内不提起诉讼又不履行的，行政机关可以申请人民法院强制执行，或者由行政机关依法强制执行。
    六、关于侵权赔偿责任
    建立行政诉讼制度的目的之一，是要使公民、法人和其他组织被行政机关或者行政机关工作人员侵犯的合法权益得到补救。如果赔偿问题得不到解决，人民法院的一些判决无法执行，公民、法人和其他组织被侵犯的权益不能得到恢复和赔偿，不能达到建立行政诉讼制度的目的。因此，草案规定：第一，公民、法人或者其他组织的合法权益受到行政机关或者行政机关工作人员作出的具体行政行为的侵犯造成损害的，有权请求赔偿。单独就损害赔偿提出请求的，应当先由行政机关处理，对行政机关的处理不服的，可以向人民法院提起诉讼。第二，行政机关或者行政机关工作人员作出的具体行政行为侵犯公民、法人或者其他组织合法权益造成损害的，由该行政机关或者该行政机关工作人员所在的行政机关负责赔偿。行政机关赔偿损失后，应当责令有故意或者重大过失的行政机关工作人员承担部分或者全部赔偿费用。需要给予行政处分的，应当给予行政处分；构成犯罪的，应当依法追究刑事责任。至于行政机关工作人员与执行职务无关的侵犯公民、法人或者其他组织合法权益的个人行为，不属于行政诉讼范围，行政机关不承担责任。第三，赔偿费用，从各级财政列支。各级人民政府可以责令有责任的行政机关支付部分或者全部赔偿费用。具体办法由国务院规定。
    这里附带说明：草案建议行政诉讼法通过后，自1990年4月1日起施行。在本法施行前，人民法院受理行政案件的范围和诉讼程序仍适用民事诉讼法（试行）的有关规定。
    行政诉讼法（草案）和以上说明是否妥当，请大会审议。
