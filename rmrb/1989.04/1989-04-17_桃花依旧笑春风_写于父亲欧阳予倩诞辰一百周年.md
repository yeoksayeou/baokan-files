Once, a friend asked: What does the seal "Peach Blossoms Unsuspecting Box" made of Yushan stone by OuYang Yuqian mean? Where is it now? He quoted the verse by Master Zhizhen upon seeing peach blossoms: "For thirty years, the sword seeker, how many times the leaves fall and the branches sprout; since seeing the peach blossoms, until now, there is no more doubt." But he believed that OuYang Yuqian's enlightenment without doubt was not about the Buddhist path, but about the truth of revolution.

Indeed, it is intriguing. In the vast and complex past, I remember that "peach blossoms" were closely related to my father OuYang Yuqian's life. In 1934, after my father returned from abroad to avoid the storm, someone in Shanghai invited him to shoot a sound film "New Peach Blossom Fan." The male lead was a revolutionary youth named Fang Yumin who worked underground during the "Northern Expedition," played by Jin Yan. The female lead, Xie Sufang, was an actress seeking liberation from abuse, played by Hu Ping. My father temporarily took me to the shooting scene to "act" as a little girl scattering flowers in the wedding scene between Fang Yumin and Xie Sufang. I held a basket of flowers, happily smiling, standing in front of the "groom," slowly walking forward to the wedding march. While scattering colored paper, I occasionally looked back at the "bride." Her beauty made me distracted... My father suddenly shouted: "Camera, shoot!" I was startled and almost fell, so I had to "cut" and reshoot. My father did not reprimand me in public. He stroked my head and said: "Next time, if you don't look back at the bride, you can shoot well." Decades later, Jin Yan had passed away, and Hu Ping had long been missing, but the peach blossoms still bloom beautifully every year. The song in the film, composed by Liu Xue'an and sung by Jin Yan and Lang Yuxiu: "I love you, you and I are on the same battlefield, even if the sea dries up and the stones crumble, it cannot destroy our loyalty.... Do not linger in the morning flowers and moonlight, and forget the responsibility on our shoulders. For the survival of the nation, we must fight forward; for the liberation of the masses, we must bravely take the lead..." The song still echoes in my ears.

For children, watching Peking operas like "Journey to the West" and "The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple" was as exciting as celebrating the New Year. Whether in the heavenly realm, the mundane world, or the underworld guarded by ox-head and horse-face demons, children's imaginations soared with the myths. The performances of Ye Shenglan and Zhang Eyun, from their costumes, singing, speaking, to their stage presence, captivated me. Some self-proclaimed highbrows considered Peking opera the quintessence of dramatic art, a refined and elegant work. Although my father started his artistic career as a Peking opera performer, he had a deep interest in other local operas. He often took my mother and me to watch "bouncing opera," now known as "evaluation opera." In 1936, my father directed the film "Red Plum Blossom" for Bai Yusheng. In the summer, a young girl came to our house. Her round face was adorned with a pair of bright, large eyes. This radiant evaluation opera performer was Xi Cai Lian. My father adapted the Tang Dynasty poem "The Story of Du Yichun" from "The Book of the Strange" into a lyrical play "Human Face, Peach Blossoms," with Xi Cai Lian playing the female lead Du Yichun. She portrayed the lively and affectionate girl vividly. In the old society, those self-proclaimed highbrows considered "bouncing opera" a lowly art, but couldn't it also be performed elegantly and refined? The rich and colorful local operas are a treasure trove of our national drama.

When my father directed the Guilin opera "Human Face, Peach Blossoms" in Guangxi, Yin Wei played Du Yichun, and Qin Zhi played Cui Hao. The play added songs and dances. When Du Yichun discovered Cui Hao's poem: "The human face is unknown where it went, the peach blossoms still smile at the spring breeze," she fainted from disappointment. In her dream, I followed the Guilin opera performers dressed as the peach blossom fairy to run errands, singing for her, and finally, Du Yichun revived and was reunited with her beloved. This play, like a poem or a dream, lingered in my heart. Even in the gloomy winter, it made me dream of spring and happiness.

In 1956, I heard my father say that Premier Zhou reviewed the plays and thought that the Peking opera "Human Face, Peach Blossoms" was like a delicate pastoral poem and could be one of the plays for the visit to Japan. My father served as the director. He wore a black silk robe, sweating profusely, and rehearsed with Mei Boqi, Jiang Xinning, and other actors. At that time, he was already 67 years old, but he worked like a young man. Although he suffered from arthritis, he still excitedly demonstrated movements. He poured his passionate enthusiasm into the ocean of artistic creation. The post-liberation "Human Face, Peach Blossoms," in terms of performance, music, singing, dancing, lighting, and stage design, had new developments under the joint efforts of the artists of the Peking Opera House.

The Peking opera "Peach Blossom Fan" premiered in Shanghai. At that time, the enemy's artillery from the August 13th invasion had opened the gates of Shanghai. My father stood up to participate in the anti-Japanese and national salvation work, and with Tian Han, Xia Yan, Yang Hanqing, and others, formed the Shanghai Drama Salvation Association, and he was in charge of the Peking opera department. In just three days, he rushed the Peking opera "Peach Blossom Fan" onto the stage. "Peach Blossom Fan" praised the patriotic spirit of the singing girls, musicians, and other "little people." It gave a few blows to the traitors who were two-faced and slick. The audience's reaction was very strong, which angered the enemy, and it was banned after a few performances. The enemy threatened and bribed my father. The chief of the Japanese news censorship bureau, Colonel Kaneko, once invited my father to meet. My father immediately found underground party comrades, and they helped him leave Shanghai and move to Hong Kong.

　　桃花依旧笑春风
　　——写于父亲欧阳予倩诞辰一百周年
　　欧阳敬如
    曾有友人发问：欧阳予倩的一颗寿山石印章“桃花不疑盒”是什么意思？现在哪里？他引志勤禅师见桃花彻悟之偈：“三十年来寻剑客，几回落叶又抽枝；自从一见桃花后，直到如今更不疑。”但他认为欧阳予倩彻悟不疑的不是佛法之道，而是革命真理。
    确也耐人寻味，在浩渺纷繁的往事中，记得“桃花”和我父亲欧阳予倩的生活关联甚密。１９３４年父亲刚从国外避风回来，在上海有人邀请他拍摄有声影片《新桃花扇》。男主角是“北伐”时期一个从事地下工作的革命青年方与民，由金焰饰演。女主角谢素芳是一个受虐待求解放的演员，由胡萍扮演。父亲临时带我到摄影场去“扮演”方与民和谢素芳结婚场面中的洒花小女童。我提着花篮高兴得笑咪咪地站在“新郎”前面，随着结婚进行曲慢慢地向前走着。我一边洒着彩色纸屑，还不时回头去看“新娘”。她的美丽使我走了神……父亲忽然喊道：“开麦拉，拍！”可把我吓了一跳，差点摔一跤，只好“卡特”重拍。父亲没有当众责备我。他抚摸着我的头说：“你下次不要回头看新娘就能拍好的。”事过几十年，金焰虽已辞世，胡萍早已不知下落，但是桃花依然年年盛开。影片中由刘雪庵谱曲、由金焰和郎毓秀配唱的歌曲：“我爱你，你我同在一条战线，纵海枯石烂，也毁不了我们的贞坚。……休在花晨月下流连，便忘了责任在双肩。为民族的生存，要肉搏向前；为大众的解放要奋勇当先……。”这歌声仍回荡在我耳边。
    对儿童来说，看《西游记》、《火烧红莲寺》那类京剧简直像过年一样开心。无论从天上的仙境到平凡的人间，再到牛头马面守卫的阴曹地府，都是孩子的幻想随着神话飞翔。而叶盛兰和章遏云的表演，从扮相、声腔、念白到台风都使我心醉。一些自鸣清高的人认为京剧是戏曲艺术的正宗，是阳春白雪。父亲虽然是从当京剧演员正式开始他的艺术生涯，可是他对其他地方戏也有浓厚的兴趣。他常和母亲带我去看“蹦蹦戏”，现在称“评剧”。１９３６年父亲为白玉霜编导了影片《海棠红》。夏天，家里来了一位年轻的少女。她圆圆的笑脸上镶嵌着一对晶莹的大眼睛。这位光彩照人的评剧演员就是喜彩莲。父亲根据唐代《本事诗》崔护觅浆的故事改编成抒情小戏《人面桃花》，由喜彩莲扮演女主角杜宜春。她将活泼深情的少女演得栩栩如生。在旧社会，被那些自鸣清高者认为是下里巴人的“蹦蹦戏”，不是同样能表演得清雅脱俗吗？中国丰富多彩的地方戏曲是我们民族戏剧的宝库。
    父亲在广西桂林排桂剧《人面桃花》时，尹羲演杜宜春，秦致精演崔护。剧中增加了歌舞。当杜宜春发现崔护的题诗：“人面不知何处去，桃花依旧笑春风”之后，因失望而昏死过去。在她的梦境中，我跟着桂剧演员扮演桃花仙子跑龙套，为她唱曲子，最后，杜宜春还魂，和心上人终成眷属。这出戏像诗、像梦一样萦绕在我心里。即便在阴霾的冬天，它仍使我梦见春天与幸福。
    １９５６年我听见父亲说，周总理审查剧目后，认为京剧《人面桃花》像一首淡雅的田园诗，可以作为访日的剧目之一。父亲担任导演。他穿着黑色香园纱褂子，汗流浃背地和梅葆玥、江新蓉等演员排戏。当时他已６７岁高龄，但仍像青年人一样工作。虽患有关节炎，但他还兴奋地作示范动作。他将自己的激情奔流澎湃地倾注到艺术创作的海洋中。解放后的《人面桃花》，无论在表演、音乐、歌舞、灯光布景等各方面，在京剧院的艺术家们的共同协作下都有了新的发展。
    京剧《桃花扇》首次演出在上海。当时八·一三日本侵略者的炮火砸开了上海的门户。父亲挺身参加抗敌救亡工作，和田汉、夏衍、阳翰笙等组成了上海戏剧界救亡协会，他负责京剧部。只用了三天的时间他就把京剧《桃花扇》突击推上舞台。《桃花扇》歌颂了崇尚爱国气节的歌女、乐工等“小人物”。对两面三刀、八面玲珑的投降派给了几棍子。演出时观众的反应十分强烈，因而惹恼了敌人，没演几场就被禁演了。敌人对父亲威逼利诱。日本新闻检查所主任金子中佐曾约父亲见面。父亲立即找地下党的同志，他们设法帮助他离开上海转移到香港。
