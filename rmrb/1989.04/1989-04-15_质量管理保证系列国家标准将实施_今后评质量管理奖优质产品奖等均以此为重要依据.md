Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 14th.

The first set of management technology standards in China's technical standards history, the "Quality Management and Quality Assurance" series of national standards, will be implemented starting August 1st this year. The State Bureau of Technical Supervision issued a statement on this matter today.

The "Quality Management and Quality Assurance" series of national standards was issued by the State Bureau of Technical Supervision in December 1988. It includes five standards: "Guidelines for the Selection and Use of Quality Management and Quality Assurance Standards," "Quality Systems — Model for Quality Assurance in Design, Development, Production, Installation, and Servicing," "Quality Systems — Model for Quality Assurance in Production and Installation," "Quality Systems — Model for Quality Assurance in Final Inspection and Testing," and "Guidelines for Quality Management and Quality System Elements." These standards were developed based on the ISO 9000 series standards issued by the International Organization for Standardization in 1987.

The State Bureau of Technical Supervision's conversion of the ISO 9000 international standards into China's national standards and recommendation to Chinese enterprises will make the comprehensive quality management work, which has been promoted for 10 years, more scientific and standardized. This will be of great significance in improving the quality management level of enterprises and their position in international economic activities, as well as enhancing the competitiveness of products in the international market.

To quickly promote the application of these national standards in enterprises, in the future, the selection activities for the National Quality Management Award and the Excellent Product Award, as well as the issuance of production licenses and product quality certifications, will use these national standards as an important basis for evaluating the quality assurance capabilities of enterprises.

　　质量管理保证系列国家标准将实施
　　今后评质量管理奖优质产品奖等均以此为重要依据
    本报北京４月１４日讯　记者朱剑红报道：我国技术标准史上第一套管理技术标准——《质量管理和质量保证》系列国家标准将于今年８月１日开始实施。国家技术监督局今天就此作了说明。
    《质量管理和质量保证》系列国家标准是国家技术监督局于１９８８年１２月颁布的，包括５个标准，即《质量管理和质量保证标准的选择和使用指南》，《质量体系——开发、设计、生产、安装和服务的质量保证模式》，《质量体系——生产和安装的质量保证模式》，《质量体系——最终检验和试验的质量保证模式》，《质量管理和质量体系要素指南》。它是在等效采用国际标准化组织１９８７年发布的ＩＳＯ９０００系列标准基础上制订的。
    国家技术监督局将ＩＳＯ９０００国际标准转化为我国国家标准，推荐给我国企业，将使我国推行了１０年的全面质量管理工作科学化、规范化，对提高企业的质量管理水平和在国际经济活动中的地位、提高产品在国际市场上的竞争能力，有重要的意义。
    为使这项国家标准迅速在广大企业中推广应用，今后在国家质量管理奖、优质产品奖的评选活动中和发放生产许可证、产品质量认证工作中，将以这项国家标准作为评价企业质量保证能力的重要依据。
