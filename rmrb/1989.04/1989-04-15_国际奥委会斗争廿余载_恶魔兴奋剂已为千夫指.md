After the Johnson doping scandal broke, some people believed the International Olympic Committee (IOC) was to blame. However, IOC President Samaranch repeatedly stated that the organization has been fighting against doping for over twenty years.

The IOC began paying attention to and researching the issue of doping as early as 1964. That year, at the Tokyo Congress, the issue of doping was formally discussed as an agenda item. In 1965, at the Madrid Congress, a report on athletes using doping to enhance their performance was submitted to the meeting. The IOC announced that it would consider revoking the results of athletes who used doping and even disqualifying them from competition, and expressed the possibility of including provisions against doping in the Olympic Charter. At the 1966 Rome Congress, the IOC passed a resolution requiring member countries to pay close attention to the issue of doping, using the power of sports medicine institutions to educate and inform athletes, and suggesting that international sports federations clearly include anti-doping provisions in their charters. The resolution announced the idea of implementing drug testing in future international sports competitions.

In December 1967, the IOC established a committee to study drug issues, requiring athletes participating in the Olympics to sign a statement after a section of text in their registration forms. This was essentially a declaration not to use doping, making drug testing voluntary rather than mandatory. In 1967, the IOC conducted its first formal drug test at a major international competition in Mexico, marking the beginning of the fight against doping.

　　国际奥委会斗争廿余载
　　恶魔兴奋剂已为千夫指
    约翰逊服用兴奋剂的丑闻事发后，有人认为国际奥委会负有责任。国际奥委会主席萨马兰奇则一再申明，该组织已同兴奋剂进行了二十多年的斗争。
    国际奥委会早在１９６４年就注意到并开始研究兴奋剂问题。这一年，在东京的代表大会上，兴奋剂问题作为正式议题提交讨论。１９６５年，国际奥委会马德里会议上，一份有关运动员服用兴奋剂以促进比赛成绩的调查报告送到了会议桌上。国际奥委会宣布，将考虑取消服用兴奋剂者的运动成绩，甚至取消比赛资格，并表示可能把有关禁止服用兴奋剂的内容写进奥林匹克章程。１９６６年罗马代表大会上，国际奥委会通过决议，要求各成员国密切注意兴奋剂问题，借助体育医学机构的力量对运动员进行相应的宣传和教育，建议各单项国际体育组织把禁药内容明确写入章程。决议宣布了在未来国际体育比赛中实行药物检查的设想。
    １９６７年１２月，国际奥委会建立研究药物问题委员会，要求参加奥运会的运动员在报名表上的一段文字后签名。这实际上是保证不服用兴奋剂的声明，使药检成为自愿而不是强迫性的。１９６７年，国际奥委会在墨西哥一次大型国际比赛组织第一次正式药检，打响了同兴奋剂的斗争。　　许文
