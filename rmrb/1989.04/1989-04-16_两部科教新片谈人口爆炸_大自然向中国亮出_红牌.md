Two new educational films, "The Cost of Growth—Population and Economy" and "Vast Territory and Rich Resources with China—Population and Resources," have been released by the Beijing Science and Education Film Studio. The films serve as a warning: the population explosion will force the world to show China a "red card."

This educational film, filled with a sense of crisis, tells the audience that a large population needs to solve problems of food, clothing, and shelter, and the country no longer has enough funds to expand production. The relentless consumption and destruction of natural resources by a large population have already prompted nature to retaliate against us.

　　两部科教新片谈人口爆炸
　　大自然向中国亮出“红牌”
    本报讯　在我国人口突破１１亿的前夕，北京科学教育电影制片厂推出一部两集科教片《增长的代价——人口与经济》和《地大物博与中国——人口与资源》，借以警告人们：人口爆炸将迫使全世界向中国亮出“红牌”。
    这部充满忧患意识的科教影片，告诉人们，众多的人口要解决吃、穿、住的问题，国家已没有足够的资金来扩大再生产；众多人口对自然资源的无情吞食和破坏已迫使大自然在报复我们了。
