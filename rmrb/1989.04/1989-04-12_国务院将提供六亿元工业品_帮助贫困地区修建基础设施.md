The State Council will provide 600 million yuan in industrial goods to help poor regions build infrastructure

    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, April 11 - Reporter Luo Maocheng reports: The reporter learned from the "National Industrial Goods for Relief in Kind Conference" currently being held in Chengdu that the State Council has decided to allocate 600 million yuan in mid-to-low-grade industrial goods from 1989 to 1991 for relief in kind. This will continue to help poor regions build roads, bridges, and water supply projects for humans and livestock.

    From the winter of 1984 to 1987, the state allocated 2.7 billion yuan in stored grain, cotton, and cloth, using relief in kind to help poor regions build highways, waterways, bridges, and water supply projects for humans and livestock. This achieved significant economic and social benefits and was warmly supported by the people in poor regions. Due to changes in the market situation, grain, cotton, and cloth have become scarce commodities, making it difficult for the state to continue relief in kind using these items. Following the instructions of central leaders, the method was changed to using mid-to-low-grade industrial goods for relief in kind, continuing to help poor regions solve infrastructure problems. Since the second half of 1987, pilot projects were first conducted in Sichuan, Jiangxi, and Ningxia, with a total value of 250 million yuan. After more than a year of piloting, similarly satisfactory results were achieved. Sichuan Province used 150 million yuan in mid-to-low-grade industrial goods to build and renovate 192 kilometers of roads, 64 bridges totaling 1,802 meters, and 407 meters of tunnel projects in poor regions. At the same time, 1,395 human and livestock water supply projects were completed, solving the drinking water problems for 55,000 people and 64,000 head of livestock, providing convenient conditions for improving the lives of people in poor regions and developing commodity production.

    Officials and the masses in poor regions have praised the use of mid-to-low-grade industrial goods for relief in kind as the most practical and effective poverty alleviation work, a great benevolent policy of the Party and the government. They have requested to erect monuments and pass down the legacy, expressing the pure and sincere gratitude of the people in poor regions.

　　国务院将提供六亿元工业品
　　帮助贫困地区修建基础设施
    本报成都４月１１日电　记者罗茂城报道：记者从正在成都召开的“全国工业品以工代赈会议”上获悉，国务院决定从１９８９年至１９９１年拿出价值６亿元的中低档工业品以工代赈，继续帮助贫困地区修筑道路、桥梁和人畜饮水工程。
    从１９８４年冬至１９８７年，国家拿出了价值２７亿元的库存粮食、棉花、棉布，采用以工代赈的办法，帮助贫困地区修建公路、航道、桥梁和人畜饮水工程，取得了显著的经济效益和社会效益，受到贫困地区人民衷心的拥护。由于市场形势的变化，粮、棉、布已成紧俏货，要国家再用粮棉布以工代赈已有困难。根据中央领导同志的指示，改用中低档工业品以工代赈，继续帮助贫困地区解决基础设施。从１９８７年下半年以来，先在四川、江西、宁夏３省区进行试点，总金额为２５００万元。经过一年多的试点，同样取得了令人满意的效果。四川省用１５００万元中低档工业品，在贫困地区新建、改建公路１９２公里，桥梁６４座总长１８０２米，隧道工程总长４０７米。同时，共建成人畜饮水工程１３９５处，解决了５．５万余人和６．４万多头牲畜的饮水困难，为改善贫困地区人民的生活、发展商品生产提供了便利条件。
    贫困地区干部群众纷纷称赞用中低档工业品以工代赈，是最实际最有成效的一项扶贫工作，是党和政府的一大德政，纷纷要求树碑立传，世代传诵，充分表达了贫困地区人民饮水思源、纯朴真挚的感激之情。
