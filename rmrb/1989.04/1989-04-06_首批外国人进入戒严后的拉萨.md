The first batch of foreigners has arrived in Lhasa since martial law was imposed. This group, consisting of five people, arrived on April 2nd and includes the chairman of the Federal Republic of Germany's Integrated Company, Mr. Leckscharld. They are here to assist with work.

In July 1987, during Chancellor Kohl's visit to Tibet, it was agreed that Germany would help renovate the Lhasa Leather Factory. A team of German experts visited Lhasa last autumn to conduct a feasibility study and decided that the Integrated Company of the Federal Republic of Germany would invest 5.5 million marks to upgrade the technology of the factory. The experts who arrived recently began work the day after their arrival.

　　首批外国人进入戒严后的拉萨
    本报拉萨４月５日电  拉萨实行戒严后，已有第一批外国人抵达这里。这是４月２日来这里帮助工作的联邦德国综合有限公司董事长莱克夏尔德一行５人。
    １９８７年７月，联邦德国总理科尔来西藏访问时曾确定由该国帮助改建拉萨皮革厂。联邦德国专家组曾于去年秋天来拉萨考察论证，决定由联邦德国综合有限公司投资５５０万马克对该厂进行技术改造。日前来的这批专家已在抵达拉萨的次日投入工作。（刘伟　卢小飞）
