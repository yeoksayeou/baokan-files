The "Jídì" ("Polaris") returned to Qingdao

Qingdao, April 10 - Today at 10 AM, the "Jídì" ("Polaris") scientific research vessel, which had been on a 142-day voyage to the Antarctic, docked at Qingdao Port's No. 8 wharf with visible signs of wear and tear. The 115 members of the expedition, who had endured hardships, faced the cheering crowd with tears of joy.

On November 20 last year, the "Jídì" set sail from Qingdao to the Antarctic. During the 17,816-nautical-mile journey, the expedition members persevered. They risked their lives and, in less than a month, successfully built China's Zhongshan Station in the Antarctic.

    本报青岛４月１０日电　记者杨良化报道：今天上午１０时，远航南极１４２天的“极地”号远洋科学考察船带着累累伤痕驶向青岛港８号码头。１１５名历尽艰辛的考察队员面对欢呼的人群，喜极而涕。
    去年１１月２０日，“极地”号从青岛启程前往南极。在１７８１６海里的航程中，考察队员们顽强拚搏。他们冒着生命危险，在不到一个月的时间内，胜利建成了中国南极中山站。
