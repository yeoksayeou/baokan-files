Inside and Outside the Westphalia Hall
- World Table Tennis Championships Snippets II

International Kitchen

During the World Table Tennis Championships, a total of 90 chefs, led by head chef Jürgen Graenus, cooked for 2,250 athletes and officials. The menu included Asian, European, American, and Halal dishes, with one Chinese chef among them. Daily consumption included two and a half tons of fish and meat, with two farmers using two large fields to supply fresh salad daily. The organizing committee's Mr. Scholer set the basic principle: the menu should have less protein, fewer hard-to-digest items, more carbohydrates, and more vitamins. The kitchen was like a language school, with people from various countries speaking different languages, yet there were no language barriers when ordering food.

Stolen Racket

Swedish star Jan-Ove Waldner's racket was stolen during a group photo session. Fortunately, he had two identical rackets with him. However, he still felt regretful because the stolen one was his favorite. It is said that this did not affect his performance. The company that made his rackets offered a reward, willing to exchange five new rackets for the stolen one, but there was no response for many days.

New Singles Rules

On April 1, the ITTF Executive Committee made a new regulation: singles matches will use a new ball with a different weight from the team competition. The current ball weighs 2.5 grams, while the new ball will be 0.28 grams heavier. This resolution still needs to be approved by today's ITTF General Assembly.

Lightning-Fast Love

During the World Table Tennis Championships, the organizing committee assigned one West German to each of the 78 teams sent by the table tennis associations to take care of the team's activities. A Jamaican athlete fell in love with the 17-year-old female escort of his team in just a few days and proposed marriage. It is unknown whether the wedding will take place.

Mistaken Timing

The Pakistani men's team was scheduled to play against Israel at 6 PM yesterday, but after half an hour, they still did not arrive, so the match was canceled. The Pakistani side said they misread the match time and realized it too late. However, Israel believed that Pakistan intentionally did not want to compete with Israel, which was discrimination against Israel.

The ITTF Technical Committee ruled that this match was won by Israel with a score of 5:0, with each set being 15:0.

　　威斯特法利亚厅内外
    ——世乒赛点滴之二
    国际大厨房
    世乒赛期间总共有９０个厨师在首席厨师于尔根·格来努斯率领下为２２５０个运动员及官员烧饭作菜，菜单有亚洲的、欧洲的、美国的和清真式的，其中还有一名中国厨师。每天消耗两吨半鱼和肉，两户农民专用两块大田每天供应新鲜生拌菜。组委会绍勒尔先生定下基本原则：菜单要少蛋白质，少难于消化之物，多碳水化合物，多维生素。一个厨房里如同一座外语学院，各国人士各种语言，要饭要菜竟无语言困难。
    球拍被盗
    瑞典名将扬·欧·瓦尔德内尔在一次集体合影时球拍被偷走了，所幸他带了两块一模一样的球拍。不过他仍感到惋惜，因为被偷的这块他最喜欢。但据说，这不影响他发挥水平。给他制造球拍的公司发出悬赏，愿以５个新拍换回这一块，多日竟无反响。
    单打新规定
    ４月１日国际乒联执委会作出一项新规定，单打将使用一种重量有别于团体赛的新球。现在的球重２．５克，新球将比它重０．２８克，这项决议还有待今天乒联代表大会通过。
    神速的爱情
    世乒赛期间，组委会为７８个乒协派出的队各派一名西德人，以照料该队活动。牙买加代表队的一名运动员在短短几天就爱上了该队１７岁的女陪同，提出要娶她为妻，婚礼能否会举行，尚难得知。
    阴差阳错
    巴基斯坦男队昨天下午６时应与以色列比赛，但时过半小时还不来，只好取消。巴基斯坦方面说，看错了比赛时间，等发现时已经晚了。但以色列认为巴基斯坦是有意不与以色列交锋，是对以色列的歧视。
    国际乒联技术委员会判决结果，这场比赛以５∶０，每局比分１５∶０以色列胜。
