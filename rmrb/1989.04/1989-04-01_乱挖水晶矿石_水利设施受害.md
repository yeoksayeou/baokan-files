Uncontrolled Mining of Quartz Causes Damage to Water Facilities

The small reservoir at Shuijingchang in our county was completed and began storing water in November 1978. Since 1984, thousands of people from our county and Zhangpu County have been mining quartz in the reservoir every day. This has resulted in severe water and soil erosion, siltation, and frequent accidents causing personal injuries and deaths. This year, the uncontrolled mining has spread to the Gaogan Canal and the Liangshan Medium-sized Reservoir. If no measures are taken to stop this, the small reservoir at Shuijingchang, which cost over 500,000 yuan to build, will be destroyed. The safety of the Liangshan Medium-sized Reservoir and several hydropower stations will also be seriously threatened.

　　乱挖水晶矿石　水利设施受害
    我县水晶场小型水库于１９７８年１１月建成蓄水。１９８４年以来，每天我县和云霄县有上千人在这个水库内乱挖水晶矿石，造成水库水土流失，泥沙淤积，而且人身伤亡事故不断发生。今年以来，乱挖水晶矿石的战线扩展到高干渠和梁山中型水库。如不采取措施予以制止，投资５０多万元的水晶场小型水库将毁于一旦，梁山中型水库和一些水电站的安全也将受到严重威胁。
