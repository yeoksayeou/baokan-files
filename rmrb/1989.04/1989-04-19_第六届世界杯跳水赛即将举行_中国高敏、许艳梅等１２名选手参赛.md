Xinhua News Agency, Washington, April 18th.

At least six of the 11 athletes who won medals in the Seoul Olympics will participate in the upcoming Sixth World Cup Diving Championships.

An official of the organizing committee for this cup said today to our reporter that the Sixth World Cup Diving Championships is the most important diving competition this year. It will be held from May 3rd to 7th in Indianapolis, USA, with approximately 90 athletes from about 19 countries participating. Olympic champions in women's springboard and platform, Gao Min and Xu Yanmei, and silver medalists in men's springboard and platform, Tan Liangde and Xiong Ni, along with 12 other Chinese athletes, have registered to compete. It is generally believed that athletes from the United States and the Soviet Union will be the main competitors for the Chinese athletes.

This cup competition will determine the winners of men's and women's 1-meter springboard, 3-meter springboard, and platform, as well as men's and women's individual and team, and mixed team, totaling 11 gold medals. Among them, the 1-meter springboard is a new event. This competition is more favorable for the U.S. team because they have been engaged in this sport for more than 30 years, while China has only recently started this project.

Teams participating in this cup competition also include Australia, Austria, Canada, Cuba, West Germany, France, Britain, Hungary, Indonesia, Italy, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Mexico.

　　第六届世界杯跳水赛即将举行
　　中国高敏、许艳梅等１２名选手参赛
    新华社华盛顿４月１８日电　（记者陆文岳）在获得汉城奥运会跳水奖牌的１１名选手中，至少有６人将参加即将举行的第六届世界杯跳水赛。
    这届杯赛组委会的一位官员今天对本社记者说，第六届世界杯跳水赛是今年最重要的跳水比赛，将于５月３日至７日在美国印第安纳波利斯举行，大约１９个国家的９０位好手将参加比赛。奥运会女子跳板和跳台冠军高敏、许艳梅，以及男子跳板和跳台银牌获得者谭良德、熊倪等１２名中国选手已报名参加争夺。人们普遍认为，美国、苏联的选手是中国选手的最主要竞争对手。
    这次杯赛将决出男、女１米跳板、３米跳板和跳台，以及男、女个人和团体、混合团体共１１枚金牌。其中，１米跳板是新添项目。这项比赛对美国队比较有利，因为他们从事这项运动已有３０多年的历史了，而中国只是近几年才开展这个项目的。
    参加这次杯赛的还有澳大利亚、奥地利、加拿大、古巴、联邦德国、法国、英国、匈牙利、印度尼西亚、意大利、新西兰、荷兰、西班牙、瑞典、墨西哥等队。
