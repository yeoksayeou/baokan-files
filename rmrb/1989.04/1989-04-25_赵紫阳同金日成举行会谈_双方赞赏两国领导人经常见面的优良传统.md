Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 25th.

Today morning, CPC Central Committee General Secretary Zhao Ziyang held his first talk with Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea Kim Il-sung at the Kumsu Mountain Conference Hall in Pyongyang.

The talk was conducted in a very cordial and friendly atmosphere. Chairman Kim Il-sung expressed his welcome and thanks to Comrade Zhao Ziyang for visiting Korea at his invitation. He said, we have always been visiting each other as if we were relatives, with the leaders of the two countries often meeting, exchanging information, and sharing views. I hope that the two parties of China and Korea can maintain this fine tradition. He stressed that General Secretary Zhao Ziyang's visit to Korea will certainly contribute to strengthening and developing the friendly relations between the two parties, the two countries, and the peoples of the two countries, and it will also be a great encouragement to Korea's socialist construction and the cause of national reunification.

Zhao Ziyang expressed his thanks to Chairman Kim Il-sung, the Workers' Party of Korea, the Korean government, and the Korean people for their grand and warm welcome and hospitality. He said he fully agreed with Chairman Kim Il-sung's views and that the fine tradition of frequent meetings between the leaders of the two countries should be maintained. He said, now that the international situation is constantly changing, our two parties and countries are also adjusting their policies and strategies. Under these circumstances, we should maintain contact, exchange information, and increase mutual understanding and trust, so as to continuously consolidate and develop the traditional friendship between China and Korea. Zhao Ziyang also repeatedly emphasized that the CPC, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people will always unswervingly support Korea's struggle for national reunification and support Chairman Kim Il-sung and the Korean government's various reasonable initiatives for achieving national reunification and efforts to ease tensions on the peninsula.

Comrade Zhao Ziyang gave a detailed account to Chairman Kim Il-sung and other Korean leaders of the achievements and current problems in China's socialist construction, as well as the results of the efforts by the CPC to lead the entire people in implementing the spirit of the 13th Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee in rectifying the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and deepening reforms. Comrade Zhao Ziyang said, we will adhere to the established guidelines, persist in reform and opening up, and adhere to the four cardinal principles. Although we need two or three years to rectify the economic environment and rectify the economic order, the plan to double the total national economic output by the end of the century can still be achieved.

Comrade Zhao Ziyang also introduced the current political situation in China. He said, the current political situation in China is generally good.

Comrade Zhao Ziyang also introduced China's views on the current international situation and China's foreign relations. He said, we believe that the current international situation is undergoing a turning point. The CPC will continue to pursue an independent and peaceful foreign policy in diplomacy, safeguard China's sovereignty and security, support the just cause of the world's people, strive for a long-term peaceful international environment, and serve China's modernization drive.

When talking about Sino-Soviet relations, Comrade Zhao Ziyang pointed out that the Cambodian issue is still an important issue in Sino-Soviet talks. On this issue, the Soviet Union can still do something. Chairman Kim Il-sung, when talking about Prince Norodom Sihanouk's recent visit to Korea, said that Prince Norodom Sihanouk's demand for strict international supervision of the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops is correct.

Those who participated in the talks from the Chinese side included Politburo member and Vice Premier Wu Xueqian, Vice Secretary of the Central Military Commission Hong Xuezhi, Central Committee member and head of the International Liaison Department Zhu Liang, Deputy Foreign Minister Liu Shucai, Deputy Minister of Railways Luo Yunguang, and Chinese Ambassador to Korea Wen Yizhan.
