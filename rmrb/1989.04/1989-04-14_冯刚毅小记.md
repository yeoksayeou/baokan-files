Feng Gangyi, the winner of the sixth "Plum Blossom Award," still looks quite young, although he has spent 25 years on the Cantonese opera stage.

Last December, the Shenzhen Cantonese Opera Troupe came to Beijing to perform "Wind and Snow on a Returning Night," "Yin and Yang Grudge," and a set of excerpts. Feng Gangyi played the leading role in these performances, leaving a strong impression on the audience. Some veteran playwrights rightly praised him as "a phoenix in the south, whose voice resonates to the heavens."

In recent years, Feng Gangyi has played the roles of Jia Baoyu and Xu Cheng in "Jia Baoyu Pays Respects to Xiaoxiang" and "Mandarin Duck Tears Fall on Mokou Lake," respectively, earning him the title of one of the "Four Great Heavenly Kings" of Cantonese opera.

Due to his portrayal of the romantic gentleman Xu Cheng in "Mandarin Duck Tears Fall on Mokou Lake," Feng Gangyi once again shook the Cantonese opera world. Experts believe that in terms of appearance, demeanor, bearing, mannerisms, and singing style, he is very similar to the late Cantonese opera master He Feifan, even surpassing He Feifan in some aspects.

Feng Gangyi's portrayal of tragic characters is poignant and moving, showing considerable maturity. Director Zhang Qihong evaluates Feng Gangyi's handling of the role of Wei Liansheng in "Wind and Snow on a Returning Night" as follows: "From the moment he appears on stage, he has a sense of self as Wei Liansheng. He does not put on a showy performance; his inner world is rich." This is quite rare for an opera performer. Feng Gangyi skillfully uses the "conventions" of the art form without being constrained by them, infusing the role with inner strength and depth of expression.

Feng Gangyi's latest creation is the role of Song Jiulang, based on the story "Yin and Yang Grudge" from "Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio." This is a bizarre character in a bizarre story from a bizarre era. Director Yu Xiaoyu views Jiulang with sympathetic criticism, seeing him as a weak individual twisted and consumed by the feudal examination system. In the play, Jiulang repeatedly falls into a hopeless predicament, being both a man and a ghost. Feng Gangyi focuses on the psychological and spiritual aspects of this "dual" character, adding external expression. He believes that while portraying ghosts is easier than portraying humans, the portrayal of ghosts and humans, as well as yin and yang, must still adhere to logic and have a clear narrative. Feng Gangyi's portrayal is transcendent; the dialogue and communication between the yin and yang characters are smooth, and the psychological changes are natural. He examines the desolation of both the human world and the underworld, and criticizes various demons, making the audience reflect deeply.

In 1987, he won the Hundred Flowers Award for Young Drama Performers in Guangdong Province. "Every time I go on stage, I feel a surge of passion; every time I rehearse a new play, I strive to present a new face to the audience," Feng Gangyi said.

　　冯刚毅小记
　　蔡体良
    第六届“梅花奖”获得者冯刚毅看去仍十分年轻，虽然在粤剧艺坛上已度过了２５个春秋。
    去年底深圳市粤剧团来京演出《风雪夜归人》、《阴阳怨》和一台折子戏，冯刚毅在这几台戏里都担任主角，给人留下了突出的印象。一些老剧作家称他“天南一凤，声振九霄”，是有道理的。
    冯刚毅近年在《宝玉祭潇湘》、《鸳鸯泪洒莫愁湖》等剧中饰贾宝玉和徐澄，赢得了粤剧“四大天王”之一的美名。
    由于在《鸳鸯泪洒莫愁湖》中塑造了多情公子徐澄，冯刚毅又一次震动粤坛。专家们认为，他在扮相、形格、风度、做派、唱腔诸方面，都与已故粤剧名家何非凡十分相似，甚至“神似凡腔，胜似凡腔”。
    冯刚毅塑造的悲剧形象凄楚动人，显得相当成熟。导演张奇虹这样评价冯刚毅对《风雪夜归人》中魏莲生这一角色的处理：“他一出场，都有人物的自我感觉。他坚信自己是魏莲生，没有摆花架子，内心是充实的。”这对戏曲演员来说，是十分难得的了。冯刚毅既调动“程式”的语言，又不受“程式”的束缚，使角色充满了内在的力量和表现的厚度。
    冯刚毅最新创造的角色是取材于《聊斋·阴阳怨》中的宋九郎。这是荒诞时代里的一则荒诞故事中的一个荒诞人物。导演余笑予对九郎是同情的批判，认为九郎是一个被封建科举制度扭曲和吞噬的弱者，他在剧中不断地陷入了不能自拔的绝境，是人也是鬼。冯刚毅面对这个“双重”身份的人物，着意于心理和心灵的开掘，并加以外化。他认为，画鬼容易画人难，鬼与人也好，阴怨与阳恨也好，在人物塑造中仍需符合情理、脉络清晰。冯刚毅的处理是超脱的，阴阳人物之间的对话和沟通，心理变幻自如。既审视了世间地府的悲凉，又对种种魑魅作了道德批判，令人深思。
    １９８７年，他荣获广东省青年戏剧演员百花奖。“我每次登台，都有一种激情；我每排一出新戏，都力求给观众一个新面貌。”冯刚毅这样说。
