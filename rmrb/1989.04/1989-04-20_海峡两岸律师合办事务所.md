The sign for the "Yi Li Strait Joint Law Firm" was hung at the entrance of the Taiwan Hotel in Fuzhou today.

The director of the Fujian Province Taiwan Compatriot Law Firm, Tan Chengzu, and the head of the Taipei Yi Li Law Firm, Lü Ronghai, initiated the establishment of this joint firm in early March this year. Local officials believe that the establishment of this firm opens up a new area of cooperation between the two sides of the Strait, which will help promote the prosperity of cross-strait economic and trade relations and strengthen the bonds of kinship.
