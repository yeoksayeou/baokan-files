Mubarak Discusses Shamir's Election Plan

Israel Delays Resolution of Middle East Disputes

Our correspondent Lin Jiaoming reports from Cairo, April 20th: "As long as Mr. Shamir is in power, I find it hard to imagine any progress in the just resolution of the Middle East problem," Egyptian President Mubarak said today in an interview with the editor-in-chief of Egypt's *Al-Musawwar* Weekly. This statement essentially rejects the election plan for the West Bank and Gaza Strip proposed by Israeli Prime Minister Shamir in Washington on April 6th.

"I can frankly say that I do not believe Mr. Shamir's proposal for elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip shows any sincerity in accelerating the peace process; it is merely a tactic to delay time," President Mubarak pointed out. He questioned what laws the elections would be based on and who would nominate the candidates, noting that Shamir did not clarify these points. Mubarak asked, "Will the elected representatives serve as members of a people's committee to manage the occupied territories, or will they merely form a delegation to negotiate with Israel?"

President Mubarak believes that the PLO's demand for Israeli troops to withdraw from the occupied territories before the elections is "correct." He supports this stance.

Our correspondent Lin Jiaoming reports from Cairo, April 20th: Egyptian President Mubarak is concerned that Israel's proposal for elections is a means to "interfere with and delay" the early resolution of Middle East disputes. Today, Egyptian newspapers carried President Mubarak's recent interview with Kuwait's *Al-Siyasah* newspaper.

President Mubarak said, "If Israel is truly sincere, as I hope, there are many ways to solve the problem, but he (Shamir) only proposes elections. Why doesn't he agree to convene a Middle East conference, at least to leave hope for a Middle East conference?"

　　穆巴拉克谈沙米尔选举计划    
    以色列拖延解决中东争端
    本报开罗４月２０日电  记者林皎明报道：“只要沙米尔先生还在台上，我很难想象中东问题的公正解决会取得什么进展”，埃及总统穆巴拉克今天对埃及《图画周刊》总编辑发表上述讲话。他的这一表态，实质上否定了以色列总理沙米尔４月６日在华盛顿提出的西岸和加沙地带选举方案。
    “我可以坦率地说，我不认为沙米尔先生所提西岸和加沙地带进行选举的方案对加速和平进程表示出诚意，它只是拖延时间的伎俩”。穆巴拉克总统指出，选举依据什么法律进行，候选人由谁推荐，沙米尔都没有讲明。穆巴拉克反问：“选出的代表究竟是作为人民委员会成员管理被占领土，还是只组成代表团与以色列谈判？”
    埃及总统认为，巴解组织要求以色列军队在选举前从被占领土撤出，“是正确的”。他支持这一立场。
    本报开罗４月２０日电　记者林皎明报道：埃及总统穆巴拉克担心以色列提出选举方案是“干扰和拖延”中东争端早日解决的手段。埃及各报刊今天转载了穆巴拉克总统最近接受科威特《政治报》采访的讲话。
    穆巴拉克总统说，“如果以色列真像我希望的那样怀有诚意，解决问题的途径很多，但他（沙米尔）却只提出选举。为什么他就不同意召开中东和会，至少让中东和会留有希望？”
