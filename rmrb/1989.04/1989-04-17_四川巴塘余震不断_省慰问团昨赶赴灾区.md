Aftershocks continue in Sichuan's Batang. By 16:00 today, a total of 1,874 aftershocks have occurred, with the largest being a 4.4 magnitude, resulting in 7 deaths, 37 injuries, and over 700 severely damaged or collapsed buildings. A provincial delegation led by Vice Governor Luo Tongda departed this morning. A team of experts from the State Seismological Bureau also set out by car for the affected area today.

The journey from Chengdu to Batang is nearly 900 kilometers, with steep mountains and an average altitude of around 3,500 meters, making the roads difficult to navigate. Last night, heavy snowfall near Liting County, close to Batang, caused a disruption in telephone communications for 4 to 5 hours. Car travel is challenging, requiring the use of snow chains. The Zuba Long Gold Sand River Bridge is still not open to traffic, and the situation in Mang Kang County, Tibet Autonomous Region, on the other side of the river, remains unclear.

　　四川巴塘余震不断
　　省慰问团昨赶赴灾区
    本报成都４月１７日电　记者罗茂城报道：四川巴塘地震余震不断，到今天１６时为止，共发生余震１８７４次，最大的４．４级，死７人，伤３７人，受严重破坏、倒塌的房屋７００余幢。以副省长罗通达为团长的慰问团今晨已出发。国家地震局专家组今天也驱车赶赴震区。
    从成都至巴塘近９００公里，沿途崇山峻岭，平均海拔３５００米左右，道路难行。昨晚靠近巴塘的理塘县一带下大雪，曾使电话中断４、５个小时。汽车行驶困难，需上防滑链条。竹巴笼金沙江大桥仍未通车，一江之隔的西藏自治区芒康县的震情还不清楚。
