Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 12th.

To ensure farmers' profits, the Polish government has decided to raise the purchase prices for agricultural products starting April 17th.

This was announced today by Polish Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture Olechowski at the 9th National Congress of the Polish Agricultural Group.

He said that the state guarantees the minimum purchase prices for about three-quarters of the basic agricultural products. These guaranteed prices will be, on average, 34% higher than the current purchase prices.

Olechowski said that while raising the purchase prices for agricultural products, the state will also implement guaranteed prices to ensure farmers' profits. This is a specific manifestation of the Polish government's economic policy of prioritizing the development of agriculture and is also a requirement of the current agricultural production situation.

In recent years, due to the continuous rise in the prices of agricultural production materials, agricultural production profits have declined. Many farmers, especially young farmers, have left their land and migrated to cities. In the eastern and western rural areas of Poland, there has been a noticeable phenomenon of land abandonment.

To reverse this situation as soon as possible, the Polish government has decided to implement free purchase prices and accelerate the marketization of the food economy. The marketization of the food economy is an agreement reached by various social forces in Poland at the "Round Table Conference" not long ago.

Olechowski emphasized that for now, only the purchase prices are being raised, and the retail prices of food in stores will remain unchanged. According to the decision of the "Round Table Conference," the complete marketization of the food economy will be achieved through social consultation, especially with the support of various trade union organizations. The government will transfer subsidies to food consumers and producers.

### 为确保农民赢利　波将提高农产品收购价

　　为确保农民赢利
  　波将提高农产品收购价
    新华社华沙４月１２日电　（记者董福生）波兰政府决定从４月１７日起提高农产品收购价格。
    这是波兰副总理兼农业部长奥莱夏克今天在波兰农业小组第９次全国代表大会上宣布的。
    他说，国家对大约３／４的基本农产品实行由国家担保的最低收购价格。这种担保价格将比目前的收购价格平均提高３４％。
    奥莱夏克说，在提高农产品收购价格的同时实行国家担保价格，旨在确保农民赢利。这是波兰政府优先发展农业的经济政策的具体体现，也是目前农业生产形势所要求的。
    近年来，由于农业生产资料价格不断上涨，导致农业生产赢利下降。一些农民，特别是青年农民纷纷背土离乡，流入城市。在波兰东部和西部农村地区，出现了明显的土地荒废现象。
    为了尽早扭转这种现象，波兰政府决定实行自由收购价格，加速推行食品经济的市场化。食品经济市场化是波兰各社会力量不久前在“圆桌会议”上达成的协议。
    奥莱夏克强调，目前只是提高收购价格，商店里食品的零售价格保持不变。根据“圆桌会议”的决定，食品经济的完全市场化将通过社会协商，特别是在征得各工会组织支持后实现。政府将把补贴转入食品消费者和生产者手中。
