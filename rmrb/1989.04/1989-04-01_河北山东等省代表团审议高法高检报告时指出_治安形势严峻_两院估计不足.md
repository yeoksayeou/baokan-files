Representatives from Hebei, Shandong, and Other Provinces Point Out: Serious Public Security Situation, Two Courts' Estimates Insufficient

		People's Daily, Beijing, March 31st, Reported by Yuán Jiàn Dá: The public security situation in the country is severe. The reports from the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate do not fully reflect this reality, which will directly affect the future comprehensive management of the social environment. Representatives from Hebei, Shandong, Heilongjiang, Guizhou, Jiangxi, and other provinces attending the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress expressed their opinions and suggestions on this matter during their group meetings today.

		Representatives such as Guō Zhì, the Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Congress, pointed out in their speeches that the Supreme People's Court's report claims that the crackdown on economic and criminal offenses last year was "timely, accurate, and powerful"; the Supreme People's Procuratorate's report mentioned that the number of bribery and embezzlement cases nationwide has decreased. This does not fully reflect the actual situation. The prominent issue currently is the increase in various criminal cases, and we have not effectively cracked down on serious criminal offenses. Former Vice Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and Governor Xué Fēng said that the Supreme People's Court has overestimated the situation. This does not reflect the current severe public security situation, nor does it reflect the actual work of the courts.

		Some representatives pointed out in their speeches that in some places, good people are now afraid of bad people, and bad people are threatening good people, causing some workers and peasants engaged in normal labor to lack a sense of security. If this is not fully recognized, it will not be possible to effectively combat criminal activities and protect the lives and property of the people.

		Some representatives believe that the reasons for these problems are numerous. Some are due to the procuratorial organs not timely accepting or handling cases that should be accepted; some grassroots courts do not enforce the law or avoid heavy penalties. Shandong representative Zhāng Jiǎ Yù also pointed out that many of our grassroots law enforcement agencies, as the first line of defense, are weak and powerless in cracking down on criminal elements.

		In response to the current severe public security situation, some representatives suggested that while the law enforcement departments should severely crack down on criminal elements, they should also strengthen the education of law enforcement personnel, eliminate illegal and disorderly behavior, bribery, and embezzlement, maintain discipline, and enforce the law.

　　河北山东等省代表团审议高法高检报告时指出
    治安形势严峻　两院估计不足
    本报北京３月３１日讯  记者袁建达报道：全国社会治安形势严峻，最高人民法院和最高人民检察院的报告对此估计不足，将会直接影响到今后的社会环境综合治理工作。出席七届全国人大二次会议的河北、山东、黑龙江、贵州、江西等一些省的代表在今天的代表团全体会议上对此提出了意见和建议。
    河北省人大主任郭志等代表在发言中指出，最高人民法院的报告认为去年对经济犯罪和刑事犯罪的打击是“及时的、准确的、有力的”；最高人民检察院报告提到去年全国贪污受贿案有所下降。这不完全符合实际情况，当前突出的问题是各种犯罪案件上升，我们对严重刑事犯罪打击不力。前河北省委副书记、省长解峰代表说，高法对形势的估计过满了。这不能反映当前社会治安的严峻状况，也不能反映法院的实际工作。
    一些代表在发言中指出，如今有些地方又出现了好人怕坏人、坏人威胁好人，使得一些从事正常劳动的职工和农民缺乏安全感，如果对此估计不足，就不能有效打击犯罪活动，保护人民群众生命财产安全。
    一些代表认为，出现这些问题的原因很多，有的是由于检察机关对应该受理的案件没有及时受理，或及时处理；有些基层法院有法不依、避重就轻。山东代表张甲玉还特别指出，我们许多基层执法机关作为第一道防线，对打击犯罪分子软弱无力。
    针对当前严峻的治安形势，一些代表建议执法部门在严厉打击犯罪分子的同时，要加强对执法工作人员的教育，杜绝违法乱纪、贪污受贿行为，严明纪律，依法办事。
