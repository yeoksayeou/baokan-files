Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 14th - Shanghai pediatricians have warned parents not to indiscriminately give their children supplements and tonics, as this can lead to premature sexual development.

In recent years, Shanghai pediatricians have encountered many parents who are anxious about unusual changes in their children's bodies. Some preschool children, even infants as young as ten months old, have suddenly developed enlarged breasts. Some boys have thickened penises, and some girls have vaginal discharge. Upon further inquiry, it was found that these children had been taking various tonics and supplements for extended periods. The Shanghai Children's Hospital's premature sexual development clinic, which has been operating for a year and a half, has conducted bone age, uterine and ovarian development, and blood hormone tests on affected children. It was discovered that about 25% of these cases of pseudo-precocious puberty were due to the use of tonics and supplements. After stopping these supplements, the symptoms of premature sexual development disappeared on their own.

Doctors have noted that parents, especially those with only one child, often give their children various supplements and tonics to help them grow faster and stronger. In addition to regular meals, these children are often given ginseng, royal jelly, chicken embryo essence, and other supplements. Some are even given ginseng, pollen, cordyceps, and even "ten-full tonic paste."

　　求健壮不惜工本　性早熟急煞家长
　　乱服补品害了孩子
    据新华社上海４月１４日电　（记者叶世涛、马雪松）上海儿科医生告诫家长：不要给孩子乱服补品、补药，防止性早熟。
    近年来，上海儿科医生在门诊中看到，一些家长焦急地反映孩子身上出现异常。有些学龄前儿童甚至十几个月的婴儿乳房忽然增长，有的男孩阴茎变粗，有的女孩阴道流出白带样分泌物，细问之下，都曾较长时期服用滋补品。开设一年半的上海儿科医院性早熟门诊，对病孩进行骨龄、子宫卵巢发育以及血液中性激素的测定检查，发现服用补药、补品的假性性早熟占２５％左右。这种性早熟病孩在停服补药以后，早熟症状自行消失。
    医生反映，疼爱独生子女的父母为了孩子长得胖，长得快，一日三餐之外，还给孩子增添各种各样的补品、补药。多数是吃人参蜂皇浆、鸡胚宝宝素，也有吃人参、花粉、冬虫夏草，以至十全大补膏的。
