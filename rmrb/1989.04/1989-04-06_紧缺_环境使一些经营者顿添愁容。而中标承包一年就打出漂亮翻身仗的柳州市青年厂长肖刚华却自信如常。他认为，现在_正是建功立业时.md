The "scarcity" environment has added worries for some managers. However, Xiaojianhua, the young director of a factory in Liuzhou, has remained confident after securing a bid and turning the factory around in just one year. He believes that now is the time to achieve greatness and build a career.

Facing shortages in funds, raw materials, energy, and other resources, many business managers have furrowed their brows. However, Xiaojianhua, the 31-year-old director of Liuzhou Canned Food Factory, still wears a confident smile.

At the beginning of last year, Xiaojianhua emerged victorious among many competitors to become the first director in Liuzhou to secure a bid and take over the factory. At that time, the state-owned Liuzhou Canned Food Factory was not in a rosy situation: it had been in operation for 12 years and had gone through 8 directors. The factory's fixed assets were worth over 100 million yuan, but its losses had already reached 22 million yuan. Xiaojianhua's condition for taking over was to create 107 million yuan in profits and taxes over three years.

Reality turned out to be more appealing than expected. At the beginning of this year, after just one year of securing the bid and taking over, the factory created 150 million yuan in profits and taxes, exceeding the three-year target by a significant margin. The per capita profit and tax was equivalent to four times the best level in the national industry in 1987. The profit and tax rate per 100 yuan of fixed assets reached 94%, while the best level in the national industry the previous year was only 33%.

Xiaojianhua, who studied economic management in university and worked in economic management after graduation, believes that the key to managing a factory lies in "management."

Take funds, for example. Society is facing shortages, and Xiaojianhua is no exception. He is skilled at making the most of funds in a scarce environment. One of his methods is to strengthen management and reduce the turnover days of working capital from 240 days the previous year to 60 days. Later, as credit tightened, many enterprises struggled to borrow money, but Xiaojianhua proactively repaid loans totaling 100 million yuan on two occasions.

To make the most of limited funds and cope with rising raw material prices, the key is to make product decisions and management adapt to market needs and changes. Xiaojianhua is well-versed in this. As soon as he took office, he stopped producing backlogged and unsold fruit canned food and switched to producing fruit juice and honey tangerines, which were popular in the market. He also focused on product quality, packaging, and sales.

Xiaojianhua's successful bid and takeover practice have strengthened his belief and understanding: pursuing good results does not necessarily require high investment. In the current "scarcity" environment, as decision-makers for enterprises, one should not and cannot rely on overzealous pursuit of input and output. Real skills and efforts should be reflected in management, expanding the market externally, and tapping potential internally.

Xiaojianhua also has his doubts: he took over a factory that was practically bankrupt, and its performance indicators quickly exceeded the best level in the national industry. This precisely shows that many enterprises in our country have much room for improvement in management. He is convinced: management can create results, management can increase momentum.

　　“紧缺”环境使一些经营者顿添愁容。而中标承包一年就打出漂亮翻身仗的柳州市青年厂长肖刚华却自信如常。他认为，现在——
    正是建功立业时
    本报记者  郑盛丰
    面对资金、原材料、能源……一系列紧缺，工商界一些经营者皱起了眉头，而柳州市罐头食品厂３１岁的厂长肖刚华，依然是满脸自信的微笑。
    去年初，肖刚华战胜众多的竞争对手，成为柳州市第一个招标承包的厂长。当时，国营企业柳州市罐头食品厂留给他的并非玖瑰色：建厂１２年，换过８任厂长；企业固定资产１００多万元，而亏损额已高达２２０万元，肖刚华承包的条件是：３年创税利１０７万元。
    现实比预想更诱人。今年初，招标承包仅１年，该厂便创利税１５０万元，超过３年税利承包指标之和；人均税利相当于全国同行业１９８７年最好水平的４倍；百元固定资产税利率高达９４％，而全国同行业上年最好水平仅３３％。
    在大学学过经济管理，工作后又从事经济管理的肖刚华，治厂之道就在“管理”二字。
    就说资金。社会紧缺，肖刚华也不例外。他善于在紧缺中把资金用活，办法之一是通过加强管理把流动资金周转天数由上年的２４０天降至６０天。后来银根日益抽紧，许多企业为借贷无门犯愁，肖刚华却先后两次主动还贷１００万元。
    要用活有限资金，消化原料涨价，关键是产品的决策与管理要适应市场的需要与变化。肖刚华深谙此道。他一上任，就停产滞销积压的水果罐头，改产市场看好的果汁应子和蜜金桔，并在产品质量、包装、推销方面下功夫。
    肖刚华招标承包的成功实践，使他坚定并强化了这个认识和感受：追求好效益，未必高投入；在当前的“紧缺”环境下，作为企业的经营决策者，更加不应也不能把出路寄托在对投入与产值的过热追求上；真本事真功夫应体现在管理上，对外拓展市场，对内挖掘潜力。
    肖刚华也有困惑：他承包的一个事实上已破产的企业，效益指标在短时间内那么轻易地超过全国同行业最好水平。这恰好说明，我国许多企业在管理上大有文章可做。他认定：管理可以出效益，管理可以增后劲。
