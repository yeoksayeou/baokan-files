In Yongji County's Beiti Village, the "reading is useless" theory has lost its market. They build a cultural village—cultivating the soil for reading to be useful

By reporters Mao Zhiyuan and Zhang Bofeng of Yuncheng Daily

Beiti Village in Yongji County, Shanxi, is quite unique. It is both an administrative village and a pastoral-industrial-commercial joint venture company. The village head and manager are one person. The village became wealthy early on, earning the name "Television Village" in 1982. It now has 10 enterprises, with an annual output value of 16 million yuan, annual foreign exchange earnings of 1 million yuan, and a per capita income of 1,170 yuan. So, how do the wealthy people here view reading?

The choice between a village of tall buildings and a cultural village

In 1982, every household in Beiti Village had a television, but they also wanted to build tall buildings to realize the goal of a village of tall buildings. However, no matter how wealthy they were, after achieving this goal, their pockets would be empty. At this time, the far-sighted village head Sun Guobin, together with party members, discussed two questions: "What does enterprise development rely on?" and "How do we take responsibility for our descendants?" They then took these two questions to the masses. Hearts that understand each other need no words. The people of Beiti realized: Beiti must first become a cultural village!

The advantages of collective economy created conditions for cultural investment. Thus, measures to build a cultural village were introduced one after another.

All primary and secondary schools in the village implemented free education; the monthly salary of all privately run teachers in the village was set at 120 yuan; scholarships were established for villagers who were admitted to high school or above; 700,000 yuan was allocated to support county and township schools, creating conditions for villagers' children to study.

No child labor in the enterprises

The rapidly developing enterprise group in Beiti Village could allow all villagers, young and old, to experience the life of a worker. The village of 1,100 people had all its villagers working in the factories, and still had to recruit 1,000 people from other villages. At this time, some farmers, seeing only the immediate benefits, made their children drop out of school to work and earn money. The company held a meeting of factory (site) managers and issued an order: no child labor in the enterprises. Those who have not obtained a junior high school diploma or above are not allowed to enter the factory. Factories found to have child labor will have their managers step down voluntarily. What shocked the villagers even more was that for those young workers in the enterprises who did not reach the junior high school cultural level, they were suspended from work to make up for their cultural studies, and were given 60% of their wages. After the assessment, they were reassigned according to their results, and those who were not qualified were dismissed.

Those with higher culture are given more important roles

In Beiti Village's enterprises, the company leaders and factory-level cadres have relatively high cultural levels, and professional and technical personnel are even more so. In recent years, the company has spent more than 200,000 yuan on education to improve the cultural quality of employees. More than 50 people have studied at colleges and universities in and outside the province, of which 17 have obtained college diplomas; more than 500 people have received professional and technical training organized by the company. Employees with high cultural levels are given important roles. Of the 16 inspectors, 12 have junior college cultural levels. Sun Changyou, originally with a junior high school education, felt very unsuited to the job, so he applied to study at Beijing Agricultural University. After returning, he became the deputy manager of the company. In this way, all the villagers realized that having culture means having a future. Thus, studying culture, learning technology, and striving for progress have become a lasting trend in Beiti.

　　在永济县北梯村，“读书无用论”失去了市场。他们通过建设文化村——
　　培植读书有用的“土壤”
　　运城报记者　毛志远　张波峰
    山西永济县北梯村很特别。既是行政村，又是牧工商联合公司。村长和经理一人兼。这个村早富，1982年就有“电视村”之名。现拥有10个企业，年产值1600万元，年创汇100万元，人均收入1170元。那么，富裕了的人们是怎样对待读书的呢？
  楼房村与文化村的抉择
    1982年，北梯村家家摆上了电视机，但是，他们还要家家盖楼房，实现楼房村。不过，他们再富有，等实现这一目标，口袋也就空空如也了。这时，深谋远虑的村长孙国宾，就和党员一起商量，出了两道题让大家讨论，一是“企业发展靠什么？”二是“怎样对儿孙负责？”接着又把这两个问题拿到群众中去。心有灵犀一点通。北梯人意识到：北梯首先要建成文化村！
    集体经济的优势为文化投入创造了条件。于是，建设文化村的一条条措施出台了。
    全村小学、初中全部实行免费教育；全村民办教师的月工资定为120元；对考上高中以上的本村学生设立奖学金；拿出7万元，资助县、镇中学，为本村子女就学创造条件。
    企业里不准有童工
    北梯村迅速发展的企业集团，足可以让全村老少尝尝当工人的滋味。全村1100人，本村人全进厂，还得从外村招1000人。这时，有些农民只看到眼前利益，竟使孩子中途辍学，进厂赚钱。公司召开各厂（场）长会议，宣布一条戒令：企业里不准有一名童工。凡没有取得初中以上文凭者，一律不准进厂。凡查出有童工的企业，厂长主动下台。更使村民受到震动的是，对现在企业里达不到初中文化水平的青年工人，停工补习文化，并发给60％工资，经考核后根据成绩另行分配，不合格者予以辞退。
      文化高的得重用
    在北梯村的企业里，公司领导和厂级干部文化水平较高，专业技术人员就更不待说了。近几年，公司为提高职工的文化素质，支出教育费20多万元。有50多人分别到省内外大专院校进修，其中有17人取得了大专文凭；有500多人接受了公司举办的专业技术培训。文化程度高的职工受到重用，16名检验员有12名都是中专文化程度。孙长?原是中等文化，自感很不适应，便申请到北京农业大学进修，回来后担任了公司副经理。这样，使全村人认识到，有文化就有出路。由此，学文化、学技术、求上进在北梯蔚成风气，经久不退。
