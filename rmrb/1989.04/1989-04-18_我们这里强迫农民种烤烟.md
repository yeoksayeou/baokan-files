On a Sunday, my father told me, "The higher-ups require every village to plant flue-cured tobacco, with 2 mu per person, and it must be carried out." I said, "This isn't a grain quota, why is it so important?" Father said, "This is even more important than the grain quota. The village has already deducted more than 10 yuan per person as a deposit." Everyone is discussing the higher-ups' forced tobacco planting: "Reducing the area for grain and expanding the area for tobacco, what kind of policy is this?" "Sigh, we are farmers. If they tell us to bow, we bow; if they tell us to kowtow, we kowtow."

Planting flue-cured tobacco can bring wealth and develop the economy. It is acceptable to guide the masses to do a bit of it. However, it is inappropriate for the higher-ups to forcefully allocate it from top to bottom. Tobacco is a harmful and useless thing for the human body. What benefits are there in large-scale tobacco planting? Moreover, planting tobacco does not necessarily bring wealth. Last year, a small number of people lost money by planting tobacco. Although our place is suitable for tobacco planting in terms of soil and climate, farmers do not have the technology for flue-cured tobacco. Such forced promotion will cause greater losses.

　　我们这里强迫农民种烤烟
    星期天，爸爸告诉我：“上面要求各村统一种烤烟，每人２分地，必须执行。”我说：“这又不是公粮任务，还那么要紧？”爸爸说：“这比公粮任务还重要，村里已经扣了每人１０多元钱作押金。”对上级强迫种烟的事，大家议论纷纷：“减少种粮面积，扩大种烟面积，这算什么政策？”“唉，咱是农民，人家叫作揖咱作揖，叫磕头就磕头。”
    种烤烟可以致富和发展经济，适当引导群众搞一点也可以。但是，由上面向下面硬性摊派，未免有些不合适吧！烟又是一种对人体有害而无益的东西，大规模的种植烟草有什么益处呢？况且，种烟未必一定能致富。去年就有少部分人种烟赔了钱。我们这里种烟，虽然土壤、气候比较适宜，但农民没有掌握烤烟技术，这样强制推广会造成更大损失。
