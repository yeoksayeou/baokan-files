People's Daily, Belgrade, April 14th - Reporter Yan Zheng reports: The 22nd Central Committee Plenum of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia began this morning at the Sava Center. According to the original schedule, the meeting was to discuss the draft principles of the League of Communists' reform, study the preparatory work for the next congress, the nature of the meeting and the date of its convening, elect new members to the Presidium of the League of Communists, and discuss the resignation requests of certain Central Committee members based on the standards for updating cadres. Due to differing opinions among Central Committee members on certain issues, the plenum was adjourned midway, with plans to reconvene on May 19th to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the League of Communists.

This plenum began with twists and turns. Central Committee member Milosevic from Serbia proposed that League of Communists Presidium Chairman Stipe Šuvar's recent speech at the Central Committee meeting of the Croatian League of Communists attacked and vilified Serbia, split Yugoslavia, and incited conflict between Serbs and Croats. Therefore, Milosevic proposed that Šuvar could not lead the meeting and should not be part of the Presidium for this plenum. This proposal was put to a vote and was rejected with 23 votes in favor and 111 votes against.

Following this, Šuvar delivered a keynote speech titled "Reform of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia," emphasizing that the reform of the League of Communists is a prerequisite and part of the profound political and social changes in Yugoslavia. He proposed that the League of Communists should engage in democratic struggles for its platform. After Šuvar's speech, 30 Central Committee members spoke, engaging in heated discussions on the direction of the League of Communists' reform, including its role, political pluralism, multi-party system, and national relations. Finally, the draft principles for the reform of the League of Communists were adopted, and Uzeirats (from Bosnia and Herzegovina), Škundrić (from Serbia), and Zejnulahu (from Kosovo) were elected as new members of the Presidium of the League of Communists.

When the meeting turned to discussing the nature of the next congress, disagreements arose. Some advocated for holding the 14th regular congress, while others proposed holding an extraordinary congress. The essence of the disagreement was how to evaluate the work of the Presidium, especially Chairman Šuvar. Central Committee members from Vojvodina, Serbia, and Montenegro believed that the current Presidium and Šuvar were responsible for the current situation in Yugoslavia. To hold them accountable, they proposed holding an extraordinary congress. During the meeting, 23 Central Committee members signed up to speak. Given that consensus on this issue was difficult to achieve at the moment, the Presidium announced a four-day adjournment, with plans for the Presidium of the League of Communists to make efforts to overcome the differences and propose a unified suggestion.

　　中央委员对某些重要问题意见分歧
　　南共联盟二十二中全会休会
    本报贝尔格莱德４月１４日电　记者严正报道：南共联盟２２中全会今天上午在萨瓦中心开幕，按原定日程，会议要讨论南共联盟改革原则草案，研究下届代表大会的预备工作、会议性质和举行日期，补选南共联盟主席团成员，讨论某些中央委员根据更新干部的标准所提出的辞职要求。由于中央委员对某些问题看法不一，致使全会中途休会，预备５月１９日庆祝南共联盟成立７０周年时再复会。
    这次全会一开始就出现了曲折，来自塞尔维亚的中央委员米洛耶维森提出建议，认为南共联盟主席团主席舒瓦尔在最近一次克罗地亚共盟中央会议上的讲话攻击和仇视塞尔维亚，分裂南斯拉夫，挑起塞尔维亚人和克罗地亚人之间的冲突，因此不能接受他的领导，舒瓦尔不能进入这次全会的主席团。此建议付诸表决时，以２３票赞成、１１１票反对而被否决。
    接着舒瓦尔在会上作了题为《南共联盟改革》的主旨报告，他强调南共联盟的改革是南斯拉夫整个社会政治深刻变革的先决条件，也是其中的一部分，其原则是改革它的社会作用。他提出南共联盟要为自己的纲领进行民主斗争。在舒瓦尔讲话后，有３０名中央委员发言，他们对南共联盟改革的方向，其中包括南共联盟的作用、政治多元化、多党制、民族关系等问题展开了热烈的讨论，最后通过了南共联盟改革原则草案，选出乌·乌泽拉茨（来自波黑共和国）、佩·什昆德里奇（来自塞尔维亚）和尤·泽伊努拉胡（来自科索沃）为南共联盟主席团新成员。
    当会议进入研究下届代表大会性质这个议题时发生了分歧，有的主张召开第１４次正常的代表大会，有的主张召开非常代表大会，其分歧的实质是如何评价中央主席团特别是主席舒瓦尔工作的问题。伏伊伏丁那、塞尔维亚和黑山的中央委员认为本届中央主席团和舒瓦尔对目前南斯拉夫的局势负有责任，为了追究其责任，因此他们提出召开非常代表大会。在会上有２３名中央委员报名要求发言，鉴于这个问题一时难以取得一致意见，因此会议主席团宣布休会４天，预备由南共联盟主席团作出努力克服分歧后提出统一的建议。
