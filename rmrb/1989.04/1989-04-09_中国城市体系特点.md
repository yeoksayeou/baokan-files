The president of the Chinese Urban Economics Society, Wang Daohan, believes that China's urban system has three main characteristics:

First, the total urban population is among the highest in the world, but the level of urbanization is not high. Four rural residents can support one urban resident in terms of food supply, while one urban resident must provide industrial products and related services for four rural residents.

Second, there is a polarization in the distribution of technology and industry. Modern and advanced technologies, as well as processing and manufacturing industries and new high-tech industries, are concentrated in megacities and large cities. In contrast, rural areas and small and medium-sized cities near rural areas are dominated by manual labor, lower industrial technologies, and various industries that primarily provide primary products. This is an important reason why China has many cities with populations over one million and a large number of county-level and below cities, but relatively few mid-sized cities. It is also an important reason for the extreme imbalance in the regional distribution of economic activities, logistics, human flow, and information flow, and the overcrowding of large cities.

Third, urban structures and functions are becoming increasingly similar. Since the reforms and opening up, China's cities have largely changed from being merely industrial bases, transportation hubs, and locations of various levels of national administrative management. However, due to similar industrial structures and similar construction plans, the structures and socio-economic functions of most cities do not differ significantly.

　　中国城市体系特点
    中国城市经济学会会长汪道涵认为，我国城市体系具有三个特点：一、城市总人口已进入世界前列，但城市化水平不高。四个农村人口才能供养一个城市人口吃饭，一个城市人口要为四个农村人口提供工业产品及有关服务。二、技术和产业配置两极化。近现代技术和高技术，加工制造产业和新兴尖端产业，都集中在特大城市和大城市。而广大农村和接近农村的中小城市、小城镇，则集中着手工劳动、较低的工业技术以及主要提供初级产品的各类产业。这是我国百万以上人口大城市和县级以下城市数量众多，而中间城市不多的一个重要原因；也是经济活动、物流、人流、信息流地区分布极不均衡，大城市过分臃肿的一个重要原因。三、城市结构和城市功能的趋同。改革、开放以来，我国城市已在很大程度上改变了仅作为工业基地、交通要道和国家各级行政管理机构所在地的局面。但由于产业结构彼此相似，建设规划大体相近，绝大多数城市结构格局和经济社会功能无大差别。
