Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, April 18th - Since the beginning of the new year, Yunnan Province has been facing a severe shortage of gasoline. Farmers are eager to plow their fields and await the delivery of fertilizers and pesticides, while sugar mills are struggling with surplus white sugar that needs to be transported out. All these activities are being hindered due to the lack of gasoline. However, in the famous scenic spots of Alu Ancient Cave, Bailong Cave, and Yanzidong in southern Yunnan, tourists are flocking in large numbers, and outside these caves, cars of all sizes are parked in rows. People are puzzled about where all these cars get their gasoline from.

The "Three Caves" in southern Yunnan are located in Huixi, Mile, and Jianshui counties, with the farthest being over 200 kilometers from Kunming and the nearest being over 180 kilometers away. According to statistics from relevant departments, Bailong Cave has received 400,000 tourists in the 40 days since it opened this year. Alu Ancient Cave and Yanzidong also attract nearly 5,000 visitors daily. The reporter recently saw at the parking lot near Bailong Cave more than 40 large and small buses, vans, sedans, and trucks from various parts of Yunnan. Among these, only a few are from the tourism department and public transportation units, while the majority are marked with the names and symbols of various units.

In addition to the "Three Caves," famous tourist destinations such as Shilin, Fuxian Lake, Dali, and Xishuangbanna are also popular spots for official vehicle tourism.

On the other hand, the shortage of gasoline in Yunnan Province has become an urgent issue. According to relevant departments, a large amount of materials supporting the earthquake-stricken areas cannot be transported on time due to the gasoline shortage. The provincial earthquake relief command allocated 2,000 tons of fertilizer to the disaster-stricken areas in Baoshan, but half of it could not be transported. To address the urgent need, they had to decide to import some gasoline using foreign exchange, but this is like trying to put out a fire with a bucket of water. Facing the situation where gasoline is scarce but official vehicle tourism is thriving, many enlightened individuals in Yunnan Province pointed out that while tourism is indeed a great pleasure in life, the current priority should be on production during the busy spring plowing season. They call for the limited gasoline to be used where it is most needed.

### 汽油缺　云南生产受阻　旅游热　名胜遍地公车

　　汽油缺　云南生产受阻
　　旅游热　名胜遍地公车
    据新华社昆明４月１８日电　（记者马天泽）新春以来，云南省汽油频频告急。农民扬鞭催耕，翘首盼望化肥、农药，糖厂白糖积压，急待外运，都因汽油紧缺难以如愿。可是在滇南名胜阿庐古洞、白龙洞和燕子洞三大溶洞，却游人如织，洞外大大小小的汽车排列成阵。人们不禁纳闷，这么多汽车的汽油是从哪里来的？
    滇南“三洞”分别位于云南省的沪西、弥勒和建水三县，离昆明最远的有２００多公里，最近的也有１８０多公里。据有关部门统计，白龙洞从今年２月开放以来的４０天内，已接待游人４０万人。阿庐古洞和燕子洞每天的游客也有近５０００人。记者日前在白龙洞附近的停车场上看到，来自云南各地的大客车、面包车、小轿车和大卡车多达４０余辆，其中除少数是旅游部门的旅游车和运输单位的公共汽车外，多数是标有各单位名称和符号的车辆。
    除滇南“三洞”外，著名的石林、抚仙湖、大理和西双版纳等旅游胜地，也是公车旅游常去的地方。
    另一方面，云南省汽油短缺已成燃眉之急。据有关部门介绍，目前大批支援地震灾区的物资因汽油紧缺难于按期运输。省抗震救灾指挥部分给保山灾区２０００吨化肥，就有一半运不下去。为解燃眉之急，他们不得不决定花外汇进口一些汽油，但远水难解近渴。面对汽油紧缺而公车旅游盛行的状况，云南省不少有识之士指出，旅游固然是人生一大乐趣，但眼下正值春耕大忙季节，发展生产应是当务之急。他们呼吁把有限的汽油用在刀刃上。
