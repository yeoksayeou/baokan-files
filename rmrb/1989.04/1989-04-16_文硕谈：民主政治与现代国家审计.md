The transition from autocratic rule to democratic politics is an inevitable path for all modern nations to take. The most fundamental principle of democratic politics is the separation of powers and checks and balances. Modern national auditing is a form of checks and balances that originates from the purpose of economic supervision. According to democratic principles, all government administrative bodies and officials, entrusted by the people, manage public funds and resources and should therefore be subject to strict economic accountability. Without modern democratic politics, there would be no modern government administrative bodies and officials with economic accountability. Without such economic accountability, there would be no modern national auditing system.

From the strict requirements of modern nations, the establishment of auditing institutions should reflect the characteristics of national modernization. The ideal model for national auditing is that the auditing agency should be subordinate to the National People's Congress, the highest authority with legislative power, and should also have relatively high judicial supervision authority. This not only ensures the independence of national auditing but also enhances its authority. This meets the requirements of modern nations and is also in line with China's historical traditions. Of course, to truly achieve this, further improvement of democratic politics is needed, that is, to raise the status of representative bodies and fully play the authoritative role of representative bodies. Otherwise, even if the auditing agency is subordinate to the National People's Congress, it will inevitably be unable to effectively carry out auditing supervision work.

　　文硕谈：民主政治与现代国家审计
    从专制制度向民主政治的转变，是所有现代国家发展的必由之路，而民主政治的最基本原则，就是分权与制衡。现代国家审计就是从经济监督目的出发的一种制衡因素。按民主制原则，所有的政府行政机构和官员均受人民的委托，对公共资金和资源进行管理，就应该受到严格的经济责任制的约束。没有近代民主政治，就没有现代意义上的政府行政机构和官员的经济责任；没有这样的经济责任，就没有现代国家审计制度。
    从现代国家的严格要求来看，审计机构的设置应有反映国家现代化的特征。国家审计的理想模式应是，审计机关隶属于作为国家最高权力机关并享有立法权的全国人民代表大会，同时享有较高的司法监督权。这不仅可以保证国家审计的独立性，而且享有较高的权威性。这既符合现代国家的要求，也符合我国的历史传统。当然，要真正达到这一步，有待于民主政治的进一步完善，即应提高代议机构的地位，充分发挥代议机构的权威性作用。否则，审计机关即便隶属于全国人民代表大会，也势必无法有效地开展审计监督工作。
