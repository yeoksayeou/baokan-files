Recently, the Sichuan Provincial Education Commission and the Admissions Committee made a decision to enroll self-funded peasant students in adult higher education institutions this year.

This batch of institutions enrolling self-funded peasant students for the first time mainly includes ordinary agricultural and forestry colleges and universities, as well as workers' universities. Sichuan stipulates that after peasants pass the unified entrance examination for adult higher education, they can enroll in the schools and majors of their choice. These two types of institutions will allocate 5% to 10% of their adult enrollment quota specifically for enrolling self-funded peasant students. These self-funded students will not be assigned jobs by the state upon graduation.

　　四川省一批高校招收农民自费生
    据新华社成都四月十五日电　（通讯员何智星、记者杨力）最近，四川省教委、招生委员会作出一项决定，在今年的成人高校招生中，一批高等院校要面向农村招收农民自费大学生。
    这批首次招收农民自费生的主要是普通农、林高等学校和职工大学。四川规定，各地的农民通过成人高校招生统一考试后，方可到自己选择的学校及专业读书。这两类高校将拿出占各校成人招生计划数百分之五至十的指标专门用于招收农民自费生。这类自费生毕业时国家不包分配。
