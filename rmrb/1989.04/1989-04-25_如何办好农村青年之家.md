Early this year, we investigated some rural youth homes and found that the current state of these homes does not meet the needs of rural economic development and rural youth cultural life, which should be of concern to leaders at all levels and the Communist Youth League organizations. According to the investigation, the main problems currently facing rural youth homes are:

The situation of youth activity venues being occupied is serious. Of the more than 60 youth homes we investigated, 20% of the buildings have been turned into offices, warehouses, or workshops, and some have lost all traces of being a "home." The phenomenon of building a home but not managing it is widespread. Initially, the homes were bustling with activities, with something to see and do, but over time, they became deserted, with cobwebs hanging from the beams. This is because the youth have moved on, as some village cadres have taken the youth home's TV back to their own homes. Coupled with monotonous activities and a lack of appeal, the youth naturally do not want to go there. I suggest:

1. Leaders at all levels should pay attention to the work of youth homes, especially the village party branches and youth league branches, which should regard youth homes as a major stronghold for building rural spiritual civilization and solve the existing problems in earnest.

2. Multi-purpose rooms and joint development. The youth home in Wang Village, Jingchuan County, uses one room for multiple purposes, not only saving space but also concentrating funds. Over the past four years, the village has seen a significant reduction in feudal superstitions, gambling, and fighting, and a sharp drop in the birth rate.

3. Scientific arrangement of activity time, timely dissemination of information, and transmission of knowledge. Generally speaking, youth homes have more activities during the off-season, during festivals, and in the evenings. Additionally, youth homes should carefully arrange activities. In Dingxi County, 10 youth homes frequently organize out-of-town individuals to come to the "home" to discuss hot topics, information, and new things. Local villagers praise this form as "Jiuzhou Fangyuan," and the effect is very good.

### 如何办好农村青年之家

　　如何办好农村青年之家
    今年初，我们调查了一些地区的青年之家，发现目前的农村青年之家的现状不适应农村经济发展和农村青年文化生活的需要，应引起各级领导和共青团组织的重视。据调查，当前农村青年之家存在的主要问题是：
    青年活动场所被占用情况严重。我们调查的６０多个青年之家，２０％的房屋被作为办公室、仓库、车间，有的已找不到“家”的痕迹了。建“家”不管“家”的现象普遍存在。建“家”初期红红火火，看的、玩的样样有，时间一长，便门庭冷落，蛛丝结梁。因为青年们看的、玩的都搬了家，如有的乡村干部将青年之家的彩电搬回自己家中。加上活动内容单调，缺乏吸引力，青年们自然不愿去了。我建议：
    一、各级领导人应重视青年之家的工作，尤其是村党支部、团支部，要把青年之家当作是建设农村精神文明的主要阵地，切实解决存在的问题。
    二、一室多用，联合发展。泾川县王村青年之家一室多用，不仅节省场地，还使资金集中使用。四年来，全村封建迷信、赌博、打架斗殴的明显减少，超生率大幅度下降。
    三、科学安排活动时间，及时传播信息、传递知识。一般说，青年之家在农闲时节多活动，逢年过节多活动，晚上多活动。另外，青年之家要精心安排活动。定西县有１０个青年之家经常组织外出人员到“家”中谈热门话题，谈信息，谈新鲜事。当地村民称赞这种形式为“九洲方圆”，效果很好。
