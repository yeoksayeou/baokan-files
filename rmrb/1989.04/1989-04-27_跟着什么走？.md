Title: Following What?

I am caught in a dilemma between a song and a famous saying.

A pop star sings: Follow your feelings, your steps become lighter and more joyful, freely spreading your smile, love will stay in any place; follow your feelings... Hope is just around the corner, dreams can be found anywhere.

A wise man once said: Life is a tragedy for those who have feelings, and a comedy for those who have thoughts.

“Follow your feelings” is sung so beautifully; “thoughts—comedy, feelings—tragedy” is said so solemnly, so weightily. Whom should I listen to?

From the first day I started school, my parents repeatedly reminded me: Be diligent and studious, and aim to go to university. However, when the college entrance examination actually arrived, I failed!

Later, for a living, I became a temporary worker. On my way home from work, I passed through a maple forest. The forest always echoed with a melodious guitar sound. A young woman would always sing a song: A young man wearing a work uniform; his figure is so carefree, but his eyes are so sad... Every time I passed the forest, every time I heard her sing this song, I always felt it was sung for me. One day, my passion overwhelmed me, and I put on a dirty work uniform and ran to her, expressing my feelings in the most popular way from the movies. The smooth singing stopped abruptly, and her startled fingers broke a guitar string; she was like a startled deer...

Stepping out of the limitations of personal experience, I am thinking again: Should I follow my feelings or my thoughts?

Modern people, especially young people, face many competitions, heavy pressures, and numerous choices. Consequently, failures also come in abundance. Everyone hopes for success, and everyone fears failure. The ideals one has been pursuing can be shattered by harsh reality in an instant. The stick of failure keeps hitting one blow after another. Young people are confused about the path ahead, and therefore, they do not want to think anymore, and that is why they sing “Follow your feelings.”

In fact, following one's feelings is highly subjective, blind, and full of illusions, often leading to more failures. In other words, it is “acting on emotions, doing as one pleases.” Unrestrained, unscrupulous, and even lawless “acting on emotions, doing as one pleases” can lead to what kind of consequences? It is not hard to imagine. Of course, there are also successful examples of following one's feelings.

But comparing the two, I think it is better to follow one's thoughts, to follow reason, even though I have failed before.

### 跟着什么走？

　　跟着什么走？
    彭勇辉
    我在一首歌和一句名言之间陷入了迷茫。
    歌星唱道：跟着感觉走，脚步越来越轻，越来越快活，尽情挥洒自己的笑容，爱情会在任何地方留；跟着感觉走……希望就在不远处，梦想的事哪里都会有。
    一位先哲说：人生对于有感觉的人来说是悲剧，对于有思想的人来说是喜剧。
    “跟着感觉走”唱得那么好；“思想—喜剧，感觉—悲剧”，又说得那么郑重，那么沉重。我该听谁的呢？
    我自念书的第一天起，父母就叮咛：要刻苦、用功，将来考大学。然而，当真正高考到来的时候，我却落榜了！
    后来为了生计，我去当临时工。下班路上经过一段枫树林，林子里总飘来悠扬吉他声。一位女青年总是唱一首歌：一位年轻的小伙子，披着一件工作服；他的身影是多么潇洒，眼神却那么忧郁……。每次经过林子，每次听她唱这首歌，我总感觉是她为我而弹，为我而唱。一天，热情终于烧昏了我，我披一件脏兮兮的工作服，跑到她面前，用电影里最流行的表示方式表达了我的感觉。流畅的歌声中途哽住了，惊慌的手指挑断了一根琴弦，她像一只受惊的小鹿……
    从个人经历的局限脱身出来，我又在想，跟着感觉走，还是跟着思想走？
    现代人，特别是青年人面临的竞争多、压力重、选择多，由此而来的失败也就多。人人都希望成功，人人都害怕失败。自己苦苦追求的理想一夕之间被严酷的现实击碎，失败的棒子，一棒紧接一棒敲来。年轻人对前面的路陷入迷茫，因此，不愿再去思想，才唱出了《跟着感觉走》。
    其实，跟着感觉走，带有很大的主观性、盲目性、幻想性，往往会招致更多的失败。用另一句话解释，就是：感情用事，随心所欲。毫无节制、毫无顾忌、甚至毫无法制的“感情用事，随心所欲”会导致什么样的后果，不难想象。当然，跟着感觉走也有成功的例子。
    但两者比较，我以为是跟着思想走、跟着理智走好，虽然我曾失败过。（作者单位：湖南武警某部）
