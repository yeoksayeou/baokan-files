**Love in the Military Camp**

"Spring comes and the river water is as green as blue." In the military camp, where green is the dominant color, the love of soldiers is like the green river water under the spring sun—deep and unfathomable.

Statistics show that during the Cultural Revolution, many military officers were forced to leave the army, not just for "political reasons," but also for "personal issues." A certain unit's pilot, Little P, was a "full-time" pilot trained by the state with as much gold as his height, but because his future father-in-law was a "rightist," he was grounded and transferred to civilian work.

Nowadays, the various "taboos" in military marriages have been broken, and soldiers no longer worry about being unfairly labeled as having "low consciousness" in their marriages. Last spring, several women came to a certain unit in Beijing, accusing their military husbands who sought divorce of being "Chen Shimei." The military investigated and found that these couples had broken relationships and could not maintain their marriages. They worked closely with the women and respected the choices of the accused soldiers. A propaganda officer from a certain unit, who had married a girl from his hometown under his parents' pressure before enlisting, filed for divorce without being blamed. Instead, he was given a heavy responsibility according to his moral and talent situation. A deputy commander of a certain military region told the reporter: In recent years, hundreds of officers in their unit got married, and none were rejected because of their fiancées' "unclear social relations." More than ten officers who divorced normally were not affected in their promotions.

There are signs that the new generation of soldiers is quietly launching a "rural encirclement of cities" marriage revolution. A survey by the General Political Department shows that in recent years, more than 95% of officers who enlisted from rural areas chose partners from urban areas, and more than 90% of the officers enlisted from rural areas.

The reporter chatted with a few rural officers who "entered the city." They thought that choosing partners from urban areas was a "mix of joy and sorrow." Joy: The spouse has a higher cultural level, they have common language, fewer worries, no need to worry about the spring plowing and autumn harvest of the responsibility field, can avoid the trouble of the spouse "following the army" in the future, and can get an urban household registration after being transferred to civilian work. Sorrow: Housing is difficult, and family instability factors increase. A military leader, however, believes that officers settling in the city have more disadvantages than advantages. He said that in the past, most officers settled in rural areas, and their wives were capable and hardworking, with few "pulling the legs." Now the situation has changed. He showed the reporter a survey: Among the more than 50 officers who settled in the city, 59% hoped to be transferred to civilian work and settle in the city as soon as possible, and 45% admitted that "pulling the legs" was the main reason affecting their dedication to work.

Nowadays, although young and handsome officers are no longer the idols that girls admire like in the past, there are still many who want to be military wives. Many loyal girls dedicate their love to those soldiers who were injured and disabled in frontline battles. Their noble actions have won the admiration of millions of people. When a textile worker pushed her husband, Xu Liang, in a wheelchair across half of China, who would not applaud their true love?

Of course, it is undeniable that military marriages face challenges. In some places, the idea of being proud of being a military spouse from the 1950s and 1960s is gradually fading. Some young women have different degrees of "four fears" when dating military personnel: first, fear of spiritual emptiness; second, fear of heavy family burdens; third, fear of being left alone at home; fourth, fear of difficulties in the transfer and placement of officers. In addition, military officers generally choose partners at a later age, and the time for dating is relatively short. Even if girls abandon worldly ideas, they are not easy to make the decision to dedicate their love when they do not yet understand the ideals, interests, and values of military personnel. Therefore, military officers' choice of partners is gradually becoming more practical. According to a survey, military personnel's criteria for choosing partners are: first, "stable, upright, and virtuous," second, "understanding of emotions," and third, "appearance."

Currently, three-tenths of the divorce cases in our country are caused by the intervention of a third party, and this proportion is much higher in military divorce cases.

Facing these challenges, soldiers eagerly hope to receive help from local judicial, women's federations, trade unions, and other organizations. At the same time, they should also improve themselves to win the love that belongs to them.

　　军营里的婚恋
    新华社记者　曹国强
    “春来江水绿如蓝”。在以绿色为主色调的军营里，军人们的爱情宛如春日辉映下的一江绿水，既深沉又不可测。
    有资料表明，“文革”期间，军队干部被迫离开部队的，除“政治原因”外，大多是因为“个人问题”。某部小Ｐ是国家用等身黄金培养的“全天候”飞行员，却因未来的岳父是个“右派”，被停飞转业。
    如今，军人婚姻的种种“禁区”已被冲破，他们在婚姻上不再为无辜被戴上“觉悟不高”等帽子而担忧。前年春天，驻京某部来了七八位妇女，指责闹离婚的军人丈夫是“陈世美”。部队调查发现，这些夫妻感情破裂，婚姻关系无法维系，就过细做女方的工作，并尊重被告军人的选择。某部一位入伍前迫于父命与家乡一姑娘结婚的宣传干部果断提出离婚申请后，不但没受责难，根据其德才情况仍被委以重任。某军区一位副司令员对记者说：近年来，他们部队几百名干部结婚没有一人因未婚妻“社会关系不清”不予批准的，１０多名正常离婚干部没有一人因此影响提拔。
    有迹象表明，新一代军人们正悄悄发动着一场“农村包围城市”的婚姻革命。总政的一项调查表明：近年来，从农村入伍的干部９５％以上在城镇择偶，而农村入伍的干部要占整个干部队伍９０％以上。
    记者与几位“进城”的农村籍干部聊天，他们认为在城镇择偶“喜忧参半”。喜：爱人文化水平较高，有共同语言，后顾之忧少，不必为责任田的春耕秋收劳神费力，可免去将来家属“随军”之苦，转业后可落城里户口。忧：住房困难，家庭不稳定因素增多。一位部队领导却认为干部在城里安家弊大于利。他说，过去干部大多在农村安家，妻子泼辣能干，“拉后腿”的不多。如今情况变了。他向记者出示了一份调查：在被调查的５０多名在城里安家的干部中，５９％希望早日转业进城，４５％承认“拉后腿”是影响安心工作的主要原因。
    时下，虽然年轻漂亮的军官不再像过去那样是姑娘们崇拜的偶像，但愿作军人妻子的仍然大有人在。不少忠贞的姑娘把自己的爱情奉献给那些在前线战斗中负伤致残的军人，她们高尚的举动赢得了千千万万人的钦佩。当一名纺织女工推着丈夫徐良的轮椅走遍大半个中国时，谁不为他们真正的爱情击节赞叹呢？
    当然，勿庸讳言，军人的婚姻面对着挑战。在一些地方，五六十年代那种以当军属为荣的观念在逐步淡化。一些女青年在与军人谈恋爱时，不同程度地存在着“四怕”：一怕精神空虚，二怕家庭负担繁重，三怕独守空房，四怕干部转业安置难。另外，军队干部一般择偶时年龄偏大，谈恋爱的时间比较短，即使是抛弃了世俗观念的姑娘，在她还不了解军人的理想、兴趣和价值观时，也是不轻易做出奉献自己爱情的决定的。所以，军队干部择偶逐渐趋向实际。据一份调查资料表明：军人的择偶标准，首位的是“稳定、正派、贤慧”，其次是“懂感情”，第三才是“相貌”。
    我国目前的离婚案件中，有三成是由于第三者插足引起的，而在军人离婚案中，这个比例要高得多。
    面对挑战，军人们殷切期望得到地方司法、妇联、工会等组织的帮助，同时他们也应完善自身，去赢得属于自己的那份爱。
