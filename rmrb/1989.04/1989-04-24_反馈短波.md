	Feedback on Short Waves

	Editor:

	In the article "Money Poetry Talk" by Lin Ji published in your journal, there are two errors that should not have occurred:

	“Business changes Wu Zhu coins” – “changes” should be “restores”;

	“Qiang has no reason to be subtle” – “subtle” should be “evidence.”

	“The power is divided into a tripod, the business restores Wu Zhu coins” is a famous line from Liu Yuxi’s poem "Shu Xian Zhu Temple." “Restores” and “changes” are similar in shape but completely opposite in meaning. “Qiang has no reason to be subtle” – the character “subtle” does not rhyme with “brother” or “continue,” and it also does not make sense. It is likely that the original manuscript had the character “evidence” written in its complex form, which was then mistakenly changed.

	Since the opening of the “Seven Flavors of Books,” the content has been very attractive. On March 6th, Mr. Yang Xianyi’s article “Lu Xun’s Self-Portrait Poem” was very convincing after reading. The article mentions, “Is Lingtai real or an ancient legend?” In fact, Lingtai is real. In the eastern part of Gansu Province, adjacent to Changwu County in Shaanxi Province, there is Lingtai County. Within the county, there is the Lingtai site. This area is not far from Qishan in Shaanxi, and it is the ancestral origin of the Zhou Dynasty.

    编辑同志：
    贵刊所载林集的《钱币诗话》一文中又出了两个不应错的错字：
    “业变五铢钱”“变”为“复”之误；“羌无故实微”“微”为“征”之误。
    “势分三足鼎，业复五铢钱”是刘禹锡《蜀先主庙》一诗中的名句，“复”“变”形近，意思却完全反了。“羌无故实微”“微”字与“兄”、“赓”不押韵，而且也根本不通。大约是原稿“征”字写成繁体“徵”，就又弄错了。

    贵刊“七味书谭”开辟以来，内容十分吸引人。三月六日杨宪益先生的“鲁迅的自题小像诗”读后令人折服。文中提到“灵台是实有还是古代传说”。其实，灵台是实有的，甘萧省东部与陕西省长武县邻接处，即有灵台县，县内有灵台遗址，这一带离陕西歧山不远，是周朝先祖的发源地。
