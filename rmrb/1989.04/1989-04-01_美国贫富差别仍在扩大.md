Xinhua News Agency, March 22nd.

The wealth gap in the United States continues to widen. A report released by the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee on March 22nd stated that from 1979 to 1987, the wealth disparity in American society continued to grow.

The report indicated that from 1979 to 1987, the average annual real income of the poorest 20% of American households decreased by 6.1%, from $5,439 to $5,107. In contrast, the average annual real income of the richest 20% of households increased by 11.1%, from $61,917 to $68,775.

The report noted that during these eight years, the income gap among individuals widened more significantly than among households. From 1979 to 1987, the average annual income of the poorest 20% of individuals decreased by 9.8%, while the average annual income of the richest 20% of individuals increased by 15.6%.

However, the report also pointed out that despite the widening wealth gap, the average household income across the nation increased by 5.6% over these eight years, from $27,917 in 1979 to $29,487 in 1987.

Congressman Thomas Downey told the press that the continuing widening of the wealth gap could lead to social unrest, including increased crime and drug activities.

　　美国贫富差别仍在扩大
    美国众议院筹款委员会三月二十二日公布的一份调查报告说，在到一九八七年止的八年内，美国社会中贫富差别仍在扩大。
    这份报告说，从一九七九年到一九八七年，占美国人口百分之二十的穷人家庭的平均年实际收入下降了百分之六点一，即由五千四百三十九美元降至五千一百零七美元，而占人口百分之二十的富人家庭的平均年实际收入却增长了百分之十一点一，从六万一千九百一十七美元增至六万八千七百七十五美元。
    报告指出，在这八年间，美国个人收入差距的扩大比家庭收入差距更为显著。从一九七九年到一九八七年，占美国人口百分之二十的穷人的个人平均年收入下降了百分之九点八，而占人口百分之二十的富人的年收入增长了百分之十五点六。
    但报告又指出，尽管贫富差距不断扩大，全国家庭的平均收入在这八年间增长了百分之五点六，从一九七九年的两万七千九百一十七美元增至两万九千四百八十七美元。
    众议员托马斯·道尼对报界说，贫富差距的继续扩大可能造成社会混乱，包括犯罪和吸毒活动的增加。
