After the Qingming Festival, the crowds at West Lake become lively again. One of the popular spots for sightseeing on the lake is the temple and tomb of Yue Fei at Qixia Hill.

Introductions to the temple and tomb of Yue Fei often quote Zhao Mengfu's poem, "The grass on Yue King's tomb is sparse and scattered, the stone beasts stand in the autumn chill." This poem has a desolate and melancholic tone.

In fact, Zhao was a man of the Yuan Dynasty, and there are many poems and lyrics written earlier and better than his. Yue Fei's grandson, Yue Ke, compiled a collection of Yue Fei's materials titled "Jindao Cuibian" and its sequel "Jindao Xubian," which were completed in the first year of the Shaoding era of the Southern Song Dynasty. These collections include a "Six States Song" lyric and a seven-line poem about Yue Fei's temple and tomb, both written by people of the Southern Song Dynasty.

The lyric was written by Liu Guo, a man known for his bold and unrestrained style, who was friends with Lu You and Qin Gui. In his lyric, Liu expresses deep sorrow: "Among the heroes of the restoration, who was the one who could lead a hundred thousand? Though he lies in the wild grass, his spirit lives on, filling the hearts of men. In his youth, he rose from the rivers north of the Yellow River, with a bow that could draw two stones and a sword three feet long. He pacified Shang and Han, opened Pei and Luo, and cleansed Dongting. Looking north to the imperial capital, the cunning hare is still there, why was it not roasted first? Passing by the old camps, in Jing and E there are still remnants of the people, remembering the old general, tears flow like rain..."

The poet, Ye Shaoweng, authored "Four Dynasties Hearings," demonstrating historical insight, and thus his poem is deeply moving: "For all eternity, only Heaven knows his heart, the hero is both to be pitied and to be hated. If he had died just a moment later, how could the enemy have lasted eighty years! The dust settles silently under the cold moon, the grand portrait remains in the Lingyan Hall. If I had known he would be buried on the road to West Lake, I would regret not having prepared a fishing boat!"

Why do people often quote Zhao's poem? I think this is likely due to the influence of the "West Lake Records" compiled during the Qing Dynasty. People of the Qing Dynasty were more likely to accept the poetry of Zhao Mengfu, who served the new dynasty of the Song imperial clan, while rejecting the poetry of Liu and Ye, who had strong national consciousness. Moreover, "Jindao Cuibian" and its sequel are obscure books and are incomplete. Thus, in the eyes of later generations, Zhao's poem seems to be the earliest and best poem about Yue Fei's temple and tomb.

　　岳飞墓庙诗话
　　史莽
    时过清明，西湖的游人又热闹起来。湖上的游览热点之一，是栖霞岭下的岳飞墓庙。
    对岳飞墓庙的介绍，往往引用赵子昂的“岳王坟上草离离，秋日荒凉石兽危”这首气象衰飒的七律诗。
    其实，赵氏是元朝人，比他写得早、写得好的诗词尚有不少。岳飞孙子岳珂编纂岳飞资料集《金佗粹编》的续集《金佗续编》，编定于南宋绍定元年，就收集了南宋人题咏岳飞墓庙的《六州歌头》词一首、七律诗一首。
    词的作者是刘过，为人豪爽，词风奔放，与陆游、辛弃疾友善。他在词中悲愤地说：“中兴诸将，谁是万人英？身草莽，人虽死，气填膺，尚如生。年少起河朔，弓两石，剑三尺，定襄汉，开虢洛，洗洞庭。北望帝京，狡兔依然在，何事先烹！过旧时营垒，荆鄂有遗民，忆故将军，泪如倾……”。
    诗作者叶绍翁，著有《四朝闻见录》，有史家卓识，故诗写得沉痛：“万古知心只老天，英雄堪恨复堪怜。如公少缓须臾死，此虏安能八十年！漠漠凝尘空偃月，堂堂遗像在凌烟。早知埋骨西湖路，悔不鸱夷理钓船！”
    人们为什么常引赵氏诗，我想，这大约是受清朝人编的《西湖志》的影响。清朝人容易接受以赵宋宗室为异族新朝效劳的赵子昂的诗作，而排斥民族意识强烈的刘氏、叶氏的诗词，而《金佗粹编》和《续编》，既是冷僻书，又残缺不全。就这样，在后代的一些人眼里，好像赵氏诗是题咏岳飞墓庙最早、最好的诗篇了。
