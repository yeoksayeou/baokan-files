Title: Foreign Folktales with a Chinese Twist

In China's past collections of anecdotes and short stories, many famous foreign folktales have been altered and presented as Chinese stories. Below are a few examples I have randomly selected.

In the 24th volume of Tao Zongyi's "Nan Cun Chuo Geng Lu" from the Yuan Dynasty, there is a story titled "Misstep into a Dragon's Lair." It goes, "Xu Yanzheng said, a merchant from the business community, lost his way at sea, drifted to an island, and crawled ashore. In the dead of night, he accidentally fell into a cave. The cave was treacherous and difficult to climb out of. By dawn, there was a faint light inside the cave, and he saw countless snakes coiled together. At first, he was very frightened, but after a while, he became familiar with them, and the snakes had no intention of attacking him. What troubled him was the hunger and thirst, but he saw the snakes licking the small stones on the cave walls, not eating or drinking. Thus, the merchant also casually picked up a small stone and sucked on it, instantly forgetting his hunger and thirst. One day, he heard a faint rumble of thunder. The snakes began to stretch and rise, one after another, and he realized they were divine dragons. He then held onto the tail of a dragon and escaped, returning home by boat. He brought back dozens of the small stones he had sucked on to the capital, showing them to knowledgeable people, who identified them as precious stones like lapis lazuli. Thus, he believed that the dragon's lair was full of rare treasures. From then on, he traded in these stones and became wealthy. Yanzheng personally saw the merchant and heard this story from him." This, of course, is the story of Sindbad the Sailor from "One Thousand and One Nights." It seems that Tao Zongyi's friend heard this story from a merchant who had traveled to foreign countries via the South China Sea, but the original story was a folktale, and by the time it reached him, it had become a true account. There are also differences from the version in "One Thousand and One Nights": originally, the sailor also encountered snakes, but not in a cave. What brought him out was a giant bird, not a divine dragon. That's all. "One Thousand and One Nights" was compiled around the 12th or 13th century, and these stories were introduced to China through translation in the late Qing and early Republican periods. Therefore, it can be seen that this story had been orally transmitted to China several hundred years ago. Perhaps the merchant that Yanzheng saw was not a Chinese merchant but an Arab merchant who told this story, claiming it as his own experience.

Everyone is familiar with the ancient Greek story of the Trojan Horse. In China's "Shui Jing Zhu," there is a story about King Qin's conquest of Shu. It says that Zhang Yi, on behalf of King Qin, designed a large golden cow. The King of Shu wanted to drag the golden cow away, and Qin sent strong men to follow behind. With the golden cow leading the way, King Qin was able to pass through the Shu Road and conquer the Shu Kingdom. Even today, there is a place in Chengdu called Jinniu Dam, and this folktale has been circulating for thousands of years. These two legends are obviously the same. Zhang Yi and Odysseus are both representatives of clever strategists. "Shui Jing Zhu" is a book from the Northern Wei Dynasty. The legend of using a golden cow to conquer Shu may have been circulating in the local area even earlier, perhaps during the Qin and Han dynasties. The story of the Trojan Horse may have been transmitted to China long ago.

In the past, I have also cited many other Chinese and foreign folktales, showing that they originate from the same source. For example, in the Tang Dynasty's "Yuyang Zazu," there is a story of the famous Western "Cinderella," known as "Xiyang Jia" in Chinese folklore. In Chinese legends, this girl is named Yexian, seemingly originating from the same source as the German name. It's just that in China, this story has become a tale of a minority ethnic group in the southwest. "Yuyang Zazu" also has a hero subduing dragons story, which is quite similar to the ancient German legend of the Nibelungen. In Sun Shuo's "Mianyi Zhi" from the Tang Dynasty, there is a story of "Banqiao San Niangzi," which is similar to the story in Homer's Odyssey, the 10th volume, where the sorceress Circe turns people into pigs, as well as other ancient European legends where people are turned into donkeys. Obviously, these stories come from the same source. In Chinese folklore, there is a story about Xue Pinggui joining the army and suffering hardships. His wife remains chaste for many years, and Xue Pinggui finally returns in glory. This story is exactly the same as the "Bearskin" story in the Grimm fairy tales. Moreover, according to the pronunciation of ancient Germanic languages, Xue Pinggui means "bearskin." The above and other similar Chinese and foreign stories have been mentioned in my previous notes, so I will not detail them here.

The phenomenon of many Chinese and foreign folktales originating from the same source illustrates a problem: from ancient times, the Chinese people have had continuous exchanges and cultural interactions with other countries. Although transportation was very inconvenient in the past, the exchanges between different countries' people have never been cut off. Whether due to geographical or political factors, such cultural and ideological exchanges between peoples are difficult to completely sever. Therefore, the policy of closing the country to foreign influence is doomed to fail. Without major news, there will be minor news. These orally transmitted folktales were also a kind of minor news at that time. Even if they were altered in the process of transmission, they still managed to spread.

### 改头换面的外国民间故事

　　改头换面的外国民间故事
　　杨宪益
    在我国过去的笔记小说里，许多外国著名的民间故事都被改头换面，变成中国故事了，下面是随手摘录的几个例子。
    元代陶宗仪的南村辍耕录卷二十四有一条“误堕龙窟”，“徐彦璋云，商人某，海舶失风，飘至山岛，匍匐登岸，深夜昏黑，偶坠入一穴，其穴险峻，不可攀援，比明，穴中微有光，见大蛇无数，蟠结在内，始甚惧，久稍与之狎，蛇亦无吞噬意，所苦饥渴不可当，但见蛇时时舐石壁间小石，绝不饮啖，于是商人亦漫尔取小石噙之，顿忘饥渴，一日，闻雷声隐隐，蛇始伸展，相继腾升，才知其为神龙，遂挽蛇尾得出，附舟还家，携所噙小石数十至京城，示识者，皆鸦鹘等宝石也，乃信神龙之窟多异珍焉。自此货之致富。彦璋亲见商人，道其始末如此。”这当然就是《天方夜谭》里辛巴达水手的故事，看来是陶宗仪的朋友从当时南海到过外国的商人那里听来的，只是原来本是民间故事，到他这里变成一段真事了。同《天方夜谭》里所说也有不完全相同的地方：原来水手也遇到蛇，但不是在石窟里，带他出来的是大鸟，也不是神龙，如此而已。《天方夜谭》近一二世纪始有定本，我国翻译介绍这些故事是在清末民初，所以可见这条故事在几百年前已由口述早传到中国了，也许徐彦璋所见到的那个商人，不是中国商人，而是一个阿拉伯商人，他讲了这一段故事，故意说是自己亲身经历的。
    希腊古代关于特洛伊木马的故事是大家都熟悉的。我国的《水经注》里有一段秦王灭蜀的故事，说是张仪为秦王设计，作了一个大金牛，蜀王想把金牛拖走，秦派壮士在后面跟去，由于有金牛带路，秦王才经过蜀道灭了蜀国。一直到今天，成都还有金牛坝的地名，几千年来一直有这个民间故事流传。这两段传说显然也是同一个。张仪和奥德修斯同是善用智谋的代表人物。《水经注》是北魏时代的书，用金牛灭蜀的传说故事可能在当地流传还要更早，也许在秦汉时代，木马计的故事早已传到中国来了。
    过去我还摘引过许多其他中外民间故事，说明其来自一源，如唐代《酉阳杂俎》里有一段西方的著名“扫灰娘”辛德瑞拉故事。在中国传说里，这位姑娘名叫叶限，好像与德文名字来自一源。只是这个故事在中国变成西南少数民族的故事了。《酉阳杂俎》里还有英雄降龙故事，同德国古代的尼贝龙根传说也差不多。唐孙頠的《幻异志》里有“板桥三娘子”故事同荷马史诗奥德修纪第十卷巫女竭吉使人变猪以及其他欧洲古代传说使人变驴的故事显然也来自一源。我国民间故事讲薛平贵从军受苦，他的妻子守节许多年，薛平贵终于衣锦荣归，这段故事同格林童话里的“熊皮”故事也是完全一样，而且按照日耳曼古文读音，薛平贵也就是熊皮的意思。以上等等中外相同的故事，我在过去所写笔记里都已说过，这里就不详细摘录了。
    中外许多民间故事都来自同一来源这种现象说明一个问题，就是从辽远古代起，我国人民就同其他国家人民有不断来往和文化交流。虽然过去交通十分不便，但不同国家人民之间的来往从未隔断过。不管是地理因素还是政治因素，这种人民之间的文化思想交流是很难被完全断绝的，所以闭关锁国的做法总是行不通的。没有大道新闻，就会有小道新闻。这些口述流传的民间故事在当时也算是一些小道新闻吧，即使在流传中间，有点改头换面，但总还是传过来了。
