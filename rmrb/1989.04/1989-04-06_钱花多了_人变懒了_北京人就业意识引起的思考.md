300,000 + 700,000 = 1,000,000
300,000 refers to the number of middle school, university graduates, demobilized soldiers, and laid-off workers from enterprise labor optimization who need to be placed in Beijing each year. 700,000 refers to the number of farmers from other provinces who come to Beijing to work, do business, and engage in other labor services, distributed across more than 17,000 enterprises and institutions in the capital.

Some people might ask, since Beijing naturally increases by 300,000 laborers each year who are in a state of unemployment, and many enterprises and institutions spend a lot of money hiring migrant workers from other provinces, isn't this strange?

It's not strange at all. A relevant official from the Beijing Municipal Labor Bureau stated: Currently, people's employment awareness is changing. Jobs that are considered "satisfactory" by job seekers are first and foremost joint ventures or wholly foreign-owned enterprises. The idea of competing to work in state-owned enterprises has faded, especially for those hard, tiring, dirty jobs, and low-paying positions. Some unemployed individuals would rather stay idle than "settle for less." Industries like textiles and machinery often complain about poor working environments; while rubber manufacturing, shoe-making, hospital morgues, laundries, mines, underground work, and construction laborers, which are mainly manual labor, despite having low recruitment standards, rarely attract applicants.

A well-known state-owned machine tool factory in Beijing wanted to recruit 100 workers, with high school graduates as the target. After a few days, only 1/3 of the applicants showed up. The factory had to lower its standards, even accepting those who could only write their names and home addresses. Another state-owned cotton mill fared even worse. Before recruitment, the factory sent several teams to various neighborhoods to do publicity, but there were very few applicants. A parent of a middle school graduate said, "It's better to let the child stay at home for a few years eating idle meals than to find an unsuitable job." Another unemployed youth said, "If the enterprise has no appeal, even if you carry me there in a sedan chair, I won't go."

The tertiary industry is also a hotspot for job seekers. For example, it's not difficult to recruit workers for vegetable stalls or waste recycling. A young person frankly said: Working in a vegetable store, first, the bonuses are high; second, you can work at a leisurely pace; third, selling vegetables can help build "relationships."

Facing this situation, an economist lamented: Some young people entering society do not have a strong sense of labor as a means of livelihood. They always think they have family support. The situation of "people without jobs and jobs without people" has not changed. Those jobs that urban residents look down upon are only filled by migrant workers.

The reporter visited a hospital and spoke with a staff member responsible for managing migrant workers. The staff member said that previously, the hospital had a good tradition of workers cleaning the indoors and outdoors themselves, but now they don't do it anymore and hire migrant workers to do it. Even the kitchen, laundry, electricians, and carpenters are basically all migrant workers. The hospital's personnel far exceed the quota, but who will do these jobs? The hospital had no choice but to hire nearly 300 migrant workers, increasing the annual expenditure by 362,000 yuan. He sighed, "Now it's 'money spent, people get lazy.'"

However, the migrant workers feel quite good. In the inpatient department, the reporter met a young man wearing a white cap, white coat, and large mask. He was pushing a cart loaded with clean bed sheets and work clothes onto the elevator. During the conversation, it was learned that he is 19 years old, from Kaifeng, Henan Province. He has been working here for two years. He pushes the cart to transport clean or dirty bed sheets and work clothes for patients several times a day, earning over 100 yuan a month. In the evenings, he reads books and plays cards. He said, "This is much more relaxed than the countryside."

In the ward, the reporter met carpenter Xiao Liu. His family is from Yangyuan County, Hebei Province. He works in the hospital on a daily wage basis, earning 7.5 yuan per day. Whenever a room's sofa or table needs repair, he is called. Although he has a wife and children at home, the "hard money, soft work" here is very attractive.

　　钱花多了　人变懒了
    ——北京人就业意识引起的思考
    本报记者  赵兴林
    ３０万＋７０万＝１００万
    ３０万，是指北京一年自然增加的待安置的中学、大学毕业生、复员退伍军人，以及企业优化劳动组合下岗职工的总数。７０万，是来京务工经商和从事其它劳务的外地农民，分布首都１７０００多个企事业单位。
    也许有人会问，既然北京一年自然增加３０万个劳动力，处于待业状态；而许多企事业单位又大量花钱雇佣外地农民工，岂非怪事？
    见怪不怪。北京市劳动局有关负责同志直述其言：目前人们就业意识开始改变，被求职者视为“满意”的职业，首先是合资或外商独资企业，争着到国有企业的观念有所淡漠，特别是那些苦活、累活、脏活及工资福利待遇低的工种，一些待业人员宁肯赋闲也不愿“低就”。其中纺织、机械行业，大都抱怨工作环境差；而制胶、制鞋，医院太平间、洗衣房，矿山、井下，以及建筑业壮工等以体力劳动为主的工种，尽管招工条件低，却很少有人问津。
    北京市一家颇有名气的国营机床厂，本想招收１００名职工，应招对象是高中毕业生，时隔几天，报名应试者只有１／３。厂家只好降低标准，甚至只要会写自己名字和家庭通信地址的都要。另一家国营棉纺厂更惨。招工前，厂家派出几路人马分赴几个街道做工作，报名者寥寥无几。一位中学毕业生家长说：“宁可让孩子在家吃几年闲饭，也要等个合适的单位。”另一位待业青年则表示，没有吸引力的企业，就是用轿子抬也不去。
    第三产业也是择业的一个热门。比如，卖菜的、废品回收行业招工并不难。一位青年坦率地说：到菜店工作，一图奖金高，二图上班能悠着劲儿干，三是卖菜能建立“关系户”。
    面对这种现状，一位经济学家感慨地说：一些青年步入社会，劳动当作谋生手段的意识并不浓，他们总觉得有家庭作后盾。“有人没事干，有事没人干”的现状没有改变，那些城里人不屑一顾的活计，只好雇佣农民工填补空缺。
    记者到一家医院采访，院方负责管理农民工的一位同志说，以前医院有个好传统，室内、房前屋后，都是职工自己动手清扫卫生，而今都不干了，雇农民工干，就连食堂、洗衣房、电工、木工等，基本上都是农民工。本来医院人员大大超过编制，可是谁来干这些活呢？院方没法，雇佣近３００名农民工，每年增加开支３６．２万元，他无不感叹地说，现在是“钱花多了，人变懒了”。
    然而，农民工却感觉良好。在住院处，碰上一位头戴白帽身穿白大褂，口捂大口罩的青年人，他正把码放着洗净的床单和工作服的手推车推上电梯。交谈中得知，他１９岁，家住河南省开封市郊区，在这儿干了两年。他每天推车运送几趟洗好的或要换洗的病号床单、工作服，一月开工资１００多元，晚上看看书、打打扑克。他说，这比农村清闲多了。
    在病房遇上木工小刘，他家在河北阳原县，在医院以日计工资，一天７．５元。哪个房间的沙发、桌凳需要修理，打个电话就到。尽管家中有爱妻娇子，但这里“硬工资、软工作”，吸引力太大了。
    大量雇佣农民工，企事业单位“钱花多了，人变懒了”，有关人士认为，说到底还是“铁饭碗”、“大锅饭”造成的，解决这方面的问题，不是一件容易事，从根本上讲，有赖于城乡经济体制改革的深化，有赖于社会资源的配置、开发利用合理化。结合首都的实际，需要运用行政的、经济的和法律手段，进行综合治理、整顿，尤其要尽快制订和颁布城市容纳费和对来北京务工经商农民的具体管理细则等，加速改革现行工资制度，让那些招工难的行业和工种，提高工资福利待遇，增加吸引力。
