Nepal's Prime Minister Shrestha said on the 18th in an interview with local journalists that Nepal is ready to hold talks with India at any time to resolve all bilateral issues, including trade and transit.

He said, "We are waiting for India to propose a schedule, level, and time for the talks. As for the venue, Nepal can accept India's proposal."

Shrestha's statement was a response to Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's speech on the 16th.

Rajiv Gandhi said in his speech that India is willing to hold talks with Nepal on "all issues" between the two countries. He said that India will develop relations with Nepal in accordance with international law and custom.

Recently, India, citing the expiration of trade and transit agreements between the two sides, stopped exporting goods to Nepal and closed most of the transit points it provides to Nepal, causing economic difficulties for Nepal and worsening relations between the two countries.

　　尼泊尔首相表示
　　愿谈判解决尼印争端
    新华社加德满都４月１９日电　尼泊尔首相什雷斯塔１８日在接受当地记者采访时说，尼泊尔随时准备同印度举行谈判，以解决包括贸易和过境在内的所有双边问题。
    他说：“我们正等待着印度就会谈日程、级别和时间提出建议，至于会谈地点，尼泊尔可以接受印度的建议。”
    什雷斯塔的这一声明是对印度总理拉·甘地１６日发表的讲话所作出的反应。
    拉·甘地在讲话中表示，印度愿意同尼泊尔就两国间存在的“所有问题”举行会谈。他说，印度将按照国际法惯例同尼泊尔发展关系。
    最近，印度以双方的贸易和过境条约到期为由，停止了向尼泊尔的出口贸易并关闭了为尼提供的大部分过境点，致使尼经济发生困难，两国关系恶化。
