Zhao Ziyang, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, met with foreign representatives attending the "Third World Countries Development Strategy Discussion Conference" this afternoon in Zhongnanhai. He pointed out that developing countries need a stable political environment, social environment, and economic environment during their development process. However, they also need a good international environment. He said that developing countries need both a new political order and a new economic order. By political new order, he meant a new order where relations between countries are truly based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence; by economic new order, he meant establishing a correct South-North relationship, that is, establishing a new order of fairness, equality, and mutual benefit.

He went on to say that the current trend of détente in the world provides a good condition and environment for building these two new orders. However, this does not mean that the two new orders will naturally come into being; we still need to strive for them. Whether it is the political new order or the economic new order, it requires the unity and cooperation of Third World countries, as well as the joint efforts of all peace-loving people around the world who support development. He said that China, as a developing socialist country, regards unity and cooperation with Third World countries as a fundamental starting point of its foreign policy. China's policy in this regard will not change.

Zhao Ziyang said that at a time when the world is seeing the formation of blocs, strengthening South-South cooperation and cooperation with developing countries has even more important positive significance. When discussing this meeting, he said that for developing countries, exchanging experiences and learning from each other is a very important matter. Although developing countries have different situations, we have a common task, which is development. Therefore, the experiences and lessons of developing countries in the process of development are also meaningful to other countries.

During the meeting, Zhao Ziyang also candidly introduced China's current reform situation, the problems encountered, the causes of these problems, and so on. He said that although China is currently facing some problems, just as many friends have said, we should seriously address and pay attention to these problems, but we should not overemphasize them. Therefore, we are neither blindly optimistic nor pessimistic. He reiterated that China's policy of reform and opening up will not change.

　　赵紫阳会见第三世界国家发展讨论会代表时说    
    发展中国家需要互相借鉴
    本报北京４月２１日讯  记者孙毅报道：中共中央总书记赵紫阳今天下午在中南海会见参加“第三世界国家发展战略讨论会”的外国代表时指出，发展中国家在发展过程中需要有一个稳定的政治环境、社会环境和经济环境，但是也需要有一个很好的国际环境。他说，发展中国家既需要有一个政治新秩序，也需要一个经济新秩序。所谓政治新秩序，就是国与国之间的关系真正建立在和平共处五项原则基础上的新秩序；所谓经济新秩序，就是建立一个正确的南北关系，就是建立公正、平等和互利这样一种新秩序。
    他接着说，现在世界上出现了缓和的趋势，这就为建立两个新秩序提供了一个良好的条件和环境。但是，这并不意味着两个新秩序会自然建立起来，还需要我们努力争取。不论是政治新秩序，还是经济新秩序，都需要我们的第三世界国家团结和合作，也需要整个世界上一切爱好和平、支持发展的人民共同努力。他说，中国是发展中的社会主义国家，中国把同第三世界国家的团结和合作看作是自己对外政策的基本立足点。中国的这一政策不会改变。
    赵紫阳说，在世界上出现集团化的时候，加强南南合作、加强同发展中国家的合作有着更为重要的积极意义。在谈到此次讨论时，他说，对发展中国家而言，交流经验、互相借鉴是一个非常重要的事情。尽管发展中国家有不同的情况，但是我们有一个共同的任务，就是发展。因此，发展中国家在发展过程中的经验也好，教训也好，在另外一些国家更有意义。
    会见时，赵紫阳还向客人坦诚地介绍了中国目前改革的形势、遇到的问题、产生问题的原因等等。他说，中国现在虽然遇到一些问题，但是正像许多朋友们所讲的那样，既要认真对待、重视这些问题，但也不应看得过于严重。因此我们既不盲目乐观，也不悲观。他重申，中国改革开放的政策不会改变。
