The forestry department has been engaged in a battle against forest pests and diseases. Over 50 million acres have been treated, reducing losses by over 500 million yuan.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 19th: (Reporter Lin Zhenggen) The reporter learned from the Forestry Department that from 1986 to 1988, the Forestry Department conducted the first phase of comprehensive forest pest and disease control demonstration work in 156 counties (cities, districts) across 21 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. A total of 56 million acres of forest were comprehensively treated, reducing pest and disease losses by over 500 million yuan.

Forest pests and diseases in China are rampant, with annual occurrences exceeding 100 million acres. It is estimated that each year, the loss of timber growth amounts to over 10 million cubic meters, valued at 1 billion yuan, earning it the nickname "the silent forest fire."

In Anhui Province's Anqing region, there are 5.66 million acres of pine forests. In 1985, 890,000 acres were severely affected by pine caterpillars. After more than three years of effort, the pine caterpillars were almost entirely eradicated, and the pine forests were revived.

It is reported that over the past three years, the central and local governments have invested 50 million yuan to support the forestry department's fight against forest pests and diseases.

Vice Minister of the Forestry Department, Liu Guangrun, told reporters that the scope of the first phase of comprehensive forest pest and disease control areas only accounts for 12.5% of China's current artificial forest area, and the preventive effect is somewhat limited. He hopes that all sectors of society will continue to raise funds to save the forests.

　　林业部门与森林病虫害作斗争
　　治理五千万亩减少损失五亿元
    新华社北京４月１９日电　（记者黄正根）记者从林业部获悉：从１９８６年至１９８８年，林业部在２１个省、市、自治区的１５６个县（市、区），开展了第一期森林病虫害综合防治示范工作，综合治理了５６００万亩森林，减少病虫害损失５亿元以上。
    我国森林病虫害十分猖獗，每年发生面积都在１亿亩以上。据测算，每年损失林木生长量１０００多万立方米，价值１０亿元，被称之为“不冒烟的森林火灾”。
    安徽省安庆地区有５６６万亩松林，１９８５年有８９万亩严重发生松毛虫为害，经过３年多时间努力，松毛虫基本杀绝，松林起死回生。
    据悉，３年来中央和地方共投资５０００万元，支持林业部门与森林病虫害作斗争。
    林业部副部长刘广运在此间对记者说，第一期森林病虫害综合防治区范围，仅占我国现有人工林面积的１２．５％，防治作用有一定的局限。他希望社会各方面能继续筹集资金，救救森林。
