Title: How Sincere is Vietnam's Withdrawal Declaration?

The Vietnamese government issued a statement on April 5, announcing that it would withdraw all its troops from Cambodia by the end of September this year. This withdrawal timeline was announced by Vietnam three months ago, but it later went back on its word, losing credibility. This time, it used the phrase "solemn declaration" to express its "sincerity" regarding the withdrawal, but the international response has been quite cautious. Vietnam has played many tricks on the withdrawal issue in the past, with an insincere attitude, making people reluctant to believe its declarations and instead focusing on whether it has actual actions.

After reading the Vietnamese statement, I cannot help but have doubts: how sincere is Vietnam in politically resolving the Cambodian issue?

Firstly, Vietnam still refuses to admit its wrongdoing, continuing to use untenable reasons to justify its aggression. In the statement, it claims that the 10-year war in Cambodia was not an act of aggression but a "just cause" and "selfless aid." It even claims that this action "complies with the principles of the Non-Aligned Movement" and the United Nations Charter, and has "gained the sympathy and support of the international public opinion that loves peace and justice." This is obviously self-aggrandizement, shameless to the core. Over the past 10 years, has the international community and peace-loving people ever shown sympathy for Vietnam's aggressive actions? There has only been widespread condemnation. Every resolution passed by the United Nations has sternly pointed out the guilt of the Vietnamese authorities in aggression. The nature of aggression and anti-aggression in the Cambodian issue has long been judged by the world, but Vietnam persists in distorting the facts and reversing black and white, still stubbornly advocating that its aggression is justified. This shows that it still does not genuinely intend to give up its aggressive intentions.

Secondly, Vietnam refuses to withdraw under effective international supervision. Although its statement expresses willingness to withdraw under international supervision, it unilaterally appoints who will supervise, rather than having the United Nations negotiate and establish an international supervision mechanism. Vietnam is the aggressor and the object of supervision; what qualifications does it have to dictate in this regard? This can only show that it has ulterior motives. Everyone knows that for a period of time, there have been reports that Vietnam is using various covert means to infiltrate large numbers of Vietnamese troops into Cambodia, either as whole units or by breaking them down and integrating them into the military of the Phnom Penh puppet government. Some have taken off their uniforms and become "migrants" with guns. If international supervision is genuine and effective, such schemes to withdraw in name but remain in reality would be difficult to achieve. In short, Vietnam's refusal of effective international supervision means it does not intend to withdraw from Cambodia on time, thoroughly, and cleanly, but rather seeks to continue controlling Cambodia by all means.

Thirdly, the statement sets many conditions for the withdrawal and lays the groundwork for a return to Cambodia in the future. In the statement, Vietnam still insists on linking the withdrawal with stopping foreign "interference" and preventing the "Khmer Rouge" from regaining power, and claims that after the withdrawal, if foreign countries do not stop military aid and "interference," the Phnom Penh puppet government retains the legitimate right to request help from various countries to "defend itself." This means that the withdrawn Vietnamese troops can use this as an excuse to return to Cambodia at any time.

From this statement, it can be seen that Vietnam is still very arrogant, not only regarding itself as a "justice-seeker" but also posing as a "victor," claiming that the "Vietnamese volunteer soldiers have gloriously completed their noble mission," and the Cambodian people will "forever remember" their "merits." This boasting of shame as glory is merely self-consolation and is truly laughable.

Over the past 10 years, as the aggressor, Vietnam has tasted what it means to be an aggressor, and the world has seen it clearly, and Vietnam itself knows it well.

### 越南的撤军声明有多少诚意

　　越南的撤军声明有多少诚意
    史宗星
    越南政府４月５日发表声明，宣布它将于今年９月底以前从柬埔寨全部撤军。这个撤军时间表，越南在３个月前曾宣布过，但事后出尔反尔，从而失信于天下。此次重申，它使用了“郑重声明”一词，表白自己对撤军有了“诚意”，然而国际上的反应却是相当审慎。越南过去在撤军问题上玩过许多花样，态度很不诚实，使人们不敢再轻信它的宣言，而是要看它有没有实际行动。
    笔者在拜读越南声明后不能不存有这样的怀疑：越南在政治解决柬埔寨问题方面究竟有多大诚意？
    首先，越南至今不肯认帐，继续用站不住脚的理由为其侵略辩护。它在声明中称，１０年侵柬战争并非是侵略行为，而是“正义的行动”、“无私的援助”。甚至宣称，这种行动“符合不结盟运动的各项原则”，也符合联合国宪章，“得到世界上爱好和平和公理舆论的同情和支持”。这显然是自我吹嘘，不知羞耻为何物。过去１０年中，国际社会和爱好和平的人们什么时候对越南的侵略行为表示过同情？而有的只是一片谴责之声，联合国每次通过的决议，都严正指出越南当局的侵略之罪。柬埔寨问题的侵略与反侵略性质，世人早有公断，越南却竭力抹煞事实，颠倒黑白，仍然顽固宣扬它侵略有理，这表明它至今不肯真正放弃侵略之意。
    其次，越南拒绝在有效的国际监督下撤军。在它的声明中，虽然表示愿意在国际监督下撤军，但谁来监督却由它来单方面指派，而不是由联合国协商主持建立国际监督机构。越南是侵略者，是被监督的对象，它有什么资格在这方面擅权钦定？这只能说明它心里有鬼。谁都知道，一个时期以来，不断有报道说，越南正通过种种隐蔽手段将大批越军潜伏下来，或成建制地、或化整为零地编入金边伪政权的军队，有一些则脱下军装变成了拿枪的“移民”。如果国际监督是切实有效的，这种名撤实留的图谋就难以得逞。说穿了，越南拒绝有效的国际监督，就是不打算如期、彻底、干净地从柬埔寨撤军，而是想方设法继续控制柬埔寨。
    第三，声明为撤军提出了诸多条件，还为日后重返柬埔寨埋下了伏笔。在声明中，越南仍坚持，把撤军同停止外国“干涉”和防止“红色高棉”重新掌权“联系在一起”，并声称撤军之后，如果外国不停止军援，不停止“干涉”，金边伪政权保留请求各国帮助它“进行自卫的正当权力”。这就是说，撤走的越军随时可以以此为借口重返柬埔寨。
    从这项声明可以看出，越南至今尾巴翘得很高，不仅以“正义者”自居，还摆出了“胜利者”的架式，说什么“越南志愿军已经光荣地完成了自己崇高的任务”，柬埔寨人民将“永远铭记”他们的“功劳”。这种把耻辱当光荣来大肆吹嘘，不过是聊以自慰，实在令人可笑。
    在过去１０年中，作为侵略者的越南究竟尝到了什么滋味，世人看得清楚，越南自己心里也是有数的。
