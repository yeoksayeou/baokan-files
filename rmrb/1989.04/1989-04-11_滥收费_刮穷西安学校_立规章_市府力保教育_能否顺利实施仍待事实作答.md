Xinhua News Agency, Xian, April 10th.

The principal of Xian No. 8 Middle School complained that nearly 90% of the school's budget is consumed by "headcount fees." The school's public utilities budget is only 2,000 yuan per month, but just the security and cleaning fees amount to 200 yuan per month. This situation is quite common in Xian. More than 10% of the school's operating funds are taken away by various fees and levies, making it difficult for the schools to sustain themselves. The Xian Municipal Government has decided that starting April 1, all miscellaneous fees levied by various entities on primary and secondary schools, kindergartens, and nurseries will be strictly prohibited. Additionally, some legitimate fees will be waived to support compulsory education and pre-school education.

The municipal government has stipulated that the following 12 types of fees, which have been approved by the municipal government, will be exempted for primary and secondary schools, kindergartens, and nurseries. These fees include: greening fees, road maintenance fees, vehicle management fees, vehicle safety management fees, toll fees for overpasses, land use management fees, commercial and service industry network construction funds, municipal public facility matching fees, vegetable plot development funds, urban collective enterprise management fees, job placement fees for the unemployed, and electricity capacity expansion fees.

Any fees not approved by the municipal government and not issued with administrative or public service fee permits will be canceled. Before the municipal fee-clearing office issues a command to cancel each item, various departments, street offices, and township governments that are currently collecting various publicity fees, sponsorship fees, signboard fees, etc., will immediately stop collecting these fees from primary and secondary schools, kindergartens, and nurseries.

The municipal government also requires that primary and secondary schools, kindergartens, and nurseries be exempt from purchasing various bonds (excluding personal purchase portions) and be exempt from various certificate handling fees. In the future, district and county governments, various departments, street offices, and township governments will not be allowed to collect or levy any fees from primary and secondary schools, kindergartens, and nurseries in any form or under any pretext.

It is worth noting that in late March, when the Xian Municipal Government's standing committee meeting discussed and made this decision, some departments participating in the meeting claimed they "did not overcharge." However, the actual investigation revealed that the situation was much more severe than expected. Therefore, whether the municipal government's well-intentioned decision can be implemented remains to be seen.

　　滥收费　刮穷西安学校
　　立规章　市府力保教育
　　能否顺利实施仍待事实作答
    本报西安４月１０日电　记者景险峰报道：西安８中校长诉苦说：该校经费的近９０％被“人头费”吃掉了。学校公用事业经费每月不足２０００元，然而，仅治安费和清扫费两项，每月就要支付２００元。这种现象，在西安市比较普遍。办学经费的１０％以上被各种收费和摊派“刮”走，学校难以承受。西安市人民政府为此决定：４月１日起，严禁社会各方面向中小学、托儿所、幼儿园摊派各种杂费，并减免部分正当收费，以扶持义务教育和学龄前教育。
    市政府规定，凡属市府批准的以下１２种收费，对中小学、托儿所、幼儿园一律免收。这些收费计有：绿化费、公路养路费、车辆监理费、车辆安全管理费、立交桥通过费、征用土地管理费、商业和服务业网点建设资金、市政公用设施配套费、菜地开发基金，城镇集体企业管理费、安置待业人员管理费，以及电力增容费。
    凡未经市府批准，领取行政、事业性收费许可证的收费，一律取消。在未经市清理收费办公室逐项清理命令取消之前，各行政部门、街道办事处、乡镇政府等现正收取的各种宣传费、赞助费、标语牌费等，对中小学、托儿所、幼儿园一律先行停收。
    市政府同时要求，对中小学、托儿所、幼儿园免予购买各种债券（不含个人应购买部分），免收各种证件的手续费。今后，各区县政府、各部门以至各街道办事处、各乡镇政府，不得以任何形式、任何借口向中小学、托儿所、幼儿园乱收、乱摊派费用。
    值得注意的是，３月下旬，当西安市府常务会议讨论作出这一决定时，参加会议的有些部门则称他们“没有乱收费”，可实际调查掌握的比人们预料的要严重得多。由此可见，该市政府用心良苦作出的决定能否行得通，还有待事实作出回答。
