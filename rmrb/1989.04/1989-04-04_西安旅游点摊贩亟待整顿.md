Recently, a reporter visited several tourist spots in Xi'an and discovered that many vendors lack business ethics. Buying and selling, as well as haggling, are normal commercial activities, but the practices of some vendors here are intimidating and off-putting. Their behavior includes: swarming around customers, with many vendors following, intercepting, and surrounding them to peddle their goods. Some tourists, feeling helpless, are forced to buy items they do not want. In the picture on the right, at the entrance of the Terracotta Army Exhibition Hall, a foreign tourist wanted to buy a pair of children's shoes with a Shaanxi Northern style and a quilt cover made of patchwork cloth. She was surrounded so tightly that she could neither choose nor escape. In the picture on the left, an overseas Chinese asked about the price of a fur item, and the vendor followed her for dozens of meters, insisting that she buy it.

Furthermore, there is a serious problem of counterfeit goods. Dog fur is passed off as wolf fur, and cat fur is sold as fox fur. Fake silver coins and fake antiques are sold at high prices. The most serious issue is the smuggling of cultural relics. Many vendors hide cultural artifacts and antiques under their clothes and goods.

    西安旅游点摊贩亟待整顿
    最近记者来到西安一些旅游点发现许多摊贩不讲商业道德。有买有卖、讨价还价本是正常的商业活动，这里一些商贩的做法却令人见而生畏和反感。其表现为：发现来客一哄而上，许多人拿着衣物尾随、拦截、围攻叫卖，一些游客在无可奈何的情况下，不得不买但不自愿。下图，在秦兵马俑展览馆门前大街上，一个外国游客想买一双具有陕北地方特色的童鞋和花布拼凑的褥面，围得她无法挑选也无法走脱。左图，一位华侨只问了一句皮货的价格，这个商贩缠着她走出几十米远，非要她买不可。
    其次是：以假乱真的现象非常严重，狗皮充狼皮，猫皮当狐狸皮卖，假银元、假文物卖高价。最严重的是走私文物，许多摊床衣物下面藏着文物古董。    本报记者　张雅心摄影报道（附图片）
