Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, April 16th.

Starting this year, farmers from within and outside Heilongjiang Province who wish to work in urban areas must obtain a work permit issued by the labor department before they can find employment. This is a measure taken by Heilongjiang Province to control the blind outflow of rural labor. It is also stipulated that state-owned, collective, private enterprises, and individual businesses that need to employ farmers must go through the approval process and sign labor contracts with the workers. Those who violate these regulations will be considered as engaging in illegal employment and hiring, and will be penalized or shut down.

　　黑龙江颁发务工许可证
    新华社哈尔滨４月１６日电　（记者顾万明）从今年起，到黑龙江省城镇务工的省内外农民，必须持有劳动部门发放的务工许可证，方可找活干。这是黑龙江省为控制农村劳动力盲目外流而采取的一项措施。并规定国营、集体、私营企业和个体户因生产需要使用农民工，必须履行审批手续，并与劳动者签订劳动合同。凡违反规定的，将被视为非法务工和用工，予以处罚或取缔。
