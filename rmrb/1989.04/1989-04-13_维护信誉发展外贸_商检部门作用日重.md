Reporters Liu Xiao from People's Daily and Zhang Yi from Xinhua News Agency report: According to information from the ongoing National Meeting of Inspection and Quarantine Bureau Directors, the inspection and quarantine department, which was once obscure, has gained prominence and importance with the rapid development of China's foreign economic trade. From 1980 to the end of 1988, the department completed inspections on 4.4 million batches of imported and exported goods, with a total value of nearly 500 billion yuan.

Among these, 3.94 million batches of exported goods, valued at 267.7 billion yuan, were inspected. It was found that 2.98% of the batches were substandard, and the relevant departments were ordered to rectify or replace the goods for export, ensuring the quality of exported products. Additionally, 450,000 batches of imported goods, valued at 223.5 billion yuan, were inspected. It was discovered that 12.92% of the batches did not meet the contract or standard specifications. By issuing inspection certificates, the relevant departments were able to seek compensation from foreign entities, saving the country approximately one billion US dollars in losses each year.

While performing inspection duties, the inspection and quarantine department also supports and collaborates with the development of foreign trade through various means.

To expand export channels and introduce and develop advanced inspection technologies, the inspection and quarantine department has established business connections with more than 200 inspection agencies and manufacturers in over 60 countries and regions worldwide. Currently, China's meat processing, canned food, and aquatic product processing plants have successively obtained health registrations from countries such as the Federal Republic of Germany, the United States, and Japan, totaling 192 registrations. This allows the products of these plants to smoothly enter the markets of the aforementioned countries.

　　维护信誉发展外贸
　　商检部门作用日重
    本报讯　本报记者刘霄、新华社记者张毅报道：记者从正在召开的全国商检局长会议上获悉，10年前默默无闻的商检部门，随着我国对外经济贸易的迅猛发展而名声日显，作用日重。1980年至1988年底，完成进出口商品检验440多万批，总货值近5000亿元。
    其中检验出口商品394万余批，货值2677亿元，发现不合格批次2.98％，责成有关部门整理或换货出口，保证了出口商品的质量；检验进口商品45万余批，货值2235亿元，发现不符合合同或标准规定的批次12.92％，经出具检验证书，由有关部门对外索赔，每年为国家挽回约一亿美元损失。
    在检验把关的同时，商检部门还通过多种方式支持和配合外贸的发展。
    为了扩大出口渠道，引进和开发先进的检验技术，商检部门与世界上60多个国家和地区的200多家检验机构和厂商建立了业务联系。目前，我国肉类、罐头、水产品加工厂先后获得联邦德国、美国、日本等国的卫生注册192份，使这些厂家的产品能够顺利进入上述国家的市场。
