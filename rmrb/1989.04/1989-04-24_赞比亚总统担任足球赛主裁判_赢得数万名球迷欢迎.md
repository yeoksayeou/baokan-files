    Zambian President Acts as Referee in Football Match
    Wins Welcome from Tens of Thousands of Fans

    Xinhua News Agency, Lusaka, April 23 (Reporter Hǎo Zhāngyìn) Tens of thousands of Zambian football fans were in high spirits today as they watched a football match refereed by President Kenneth David Kaunda at the Woodlands Stadium here.

    April 28 marks President Kaunda's 65th birthday. When this elderly man, dressed in sportswear and wearing sports shoes, stepped onto the field, he was greeted with enthusiastic applause from the audience.

    The football match, refereed by Kaunda, featured the Dag team, composed of managers and directors from a company, against the "Veterans" team, made up of government cabinet ministers, parliamentarians, and senior officials.

    The 30-minute football match attracted more than 20,000 fans. In the first half, the Veterans played very actively. Despite being over fifty, Defense Minister H. Chona and Interior Minister K. K. Kaunda continued to run and attack. At the end of the first half, the score was 1-1. In the second half, the Dag team took advantage of the Veterans' declining stamina and scored another goal, ultimately winning the match 2-1.

　　赞比亚总统担任足球赛主裁判    
    赢得数万名球迷欢迎
    新华社卢萨卡４月２３日电（记者郝章印）数万名赞比亚球迷今天下午在这里的伍德兰德体育场兴高采烈地观看了一场由总统肯尼思·戴维·卡翁达担任裁判的足球赛。
    今年４月２８日是卡翁达总统６５周岁诞辰。当这位老者身着运动装、足蹬运动鞋步入比赛场地时，赢得了观众的热烈欢迎。
    由他出任主裁判的这场足球赛，一方是由一家公司的经理和主任们组成的达格足球队，一方是由政府内阁部长、议会议员和高级官员们组成的“老将”队。
    这场为时３０分钟的足球赛吸引了两万多名球迷观战。上半时老将们踢得很积极。国防部长哈·顺巴和内政部长金·金斯利尽管已年过五十，仍然不断奔跑进攻。上半时结束时，双方战成１平。下半时达格队乘老将们体力有所下降又攻入一球，结果以２∶１赢得这场胜利。
