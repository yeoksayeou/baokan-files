Today morning, at the exhibition held at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Zoning Research Institute, over a hundred books and dozens of maps showcased the significant achievements of agricultural resource surveys and zoning work over the past decade. More than 40,000 scientific and technological achievements have provided scientific bases for decision-making by various levels of leadership departments.

The "Comprehensive Agricultural Zoning of China," which was awarded the National Science and Technology Progress First Prize, has provided a scientific basis for agricultural surveys and the formulation of policies and plans. Many of its important viewpoints have been adopted by the Party Central Committee and the State Council, incorporated into relevant documents, and have provided a comprehensive, systematic, and detailed basis for fully utilizing agricultural climate resources in various regions to develop agricultural production. However, the utilization of agricultural zoning results is still far from sufficient.

At the scientific report meeting held yesterday to mark the 10th anniversary of the agricultural resource survey and agricultural zoning, State Councilor Chen Junsheng pointed out that in the future, we should further formulate comprehensive economic development plans and scientifically and rationally develop and utilize China's existing resources.

　　农业区划成果利用还不够
    陈俊生要求进一步制订综合规划，合理开发利用现有资源
    本报北京４月４日讯  今天上午，在中国科学院区划研究所展出的上百册图书资料和几十张制图，反映了农业资源调查和区划工作１０年来的重要成果。４万多项科技成果为各级领导部门决策提供了科学依据。
    被评为国家科技进步一等奖的《中国综合农业区划》一书，为农业调查和制订政策、规划提供了科学依据；其中的许多重要观点，被党中央和国务院采纳，写入了有关文件，为充分利用各地的农业气候资源发展农业生产，提供了全面、系统、翔实的依据。但是，农业区划成果的利用还远远不够。
    在昨天召开的农业资源调查和农业区划开展１０周年科学报告会上，国务委员陈俊生指出，今后要进一步制订经济发展综合规划，科学合理地开发利用我国现有的资源。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（陈满正
