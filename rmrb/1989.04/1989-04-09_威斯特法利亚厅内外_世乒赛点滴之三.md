The World Table Tennis Championship took a day off on April 5, and the organizers arranged for a special match between journalists from various countries and disabled athletes. Sixty-four journalists signed up, and when they started playing, everyone realized that there were quite a few experts among them. For example, Itoh Bun'yo, the 1969 World Men's Singles Champion from Japan, is now a sports journalist. His prime has passed, and he was eliminated early. The "World Champion" of the men's journalist match was Nikolai Popal, a journalist from West Berlin, who has been playing in local teams. The runner-up was Damyanov, a Bulgarian photographer. The women's singles champion was Grazna Bittern, a journalist from the West German table tennis newspaper, who was also a national-level athlete in the past.

The enthusiastic hosts

The Dortmund city government put a lot of effort into arranging accommodations, transportation, safety, and other aspects for this event. On the day of rest, they organized a variety of tours for the journalists: riding old-fashioned trams to tour the city, enjoying Mozart's opera, visiting various beer halls at night, and even dining at an ancient castle for a medieval-style dinner. Of course, there is another layer of meaning to this. The Ruhr region of West Germany (including Dortmund, Essen, Dusseldorf, Bochum, etc.) is vying to host the 2004 Olympics, and the publicity campaign has already begun. Let you see our facilities, our culture, we will definitely do a good job!

Excellent computer software

The West German Table Tennis Association commissioned a software company in Baden to develop a software package specifically for this tournament, which played a significant role. Athlete profiles, characteristics, match schedules, results, and everything else were all included and readily available. This software attracted a lot of interest from professionals. Representatives from Chiba City, the host of the next World Table Tennis Championship, and Barcelona, the host of the 1992 Olympics, inquired about it in more detail.

A bustling "international trade market"

Outside the competition venue is a bustling international market, with stalls and shops everywhere. Training clothes, bags, table tennis rackets, and rubber sheets are countless. Several major sponsors offered discounts during the competition, with the maximum reaching 50%. In addition, there is a small "international black market," where wooden pepper grinders made by hand are exchanged for sportswear, coffee for short-sleeved shirts, caviar, champagne, and so on. It is said that athletes from Eastern European countries particularly like the rubber sheets of the rackets, and other small gifts are even more welcome.

　　威斯特法利亚厅内外
    ——世乒赛点滴之三
    记者中不乏好手
    ４月５日世乒赛休息一天，大会特意举行了世界各国记者和残疾人两场特殊比赛。６４名记者报名，等他们一挥拍人们才恍然大悟，原来记者内也不乏行家里手。如日本１９６９年的世界男子单打冠军伊藤繁雄就是一位，他现在是一家体育报记者，他雄风已逝，早早被淘汰掉。最后得了男记者赛“世界冠军”的是西柏林记者尼古莱·波帕尔，他一直在当地球队打球，亚军是保加利亚摄影记者达米亚诺夫。女子单打冠军被西德乒乓球报记者格拉兹纳·毕特纳夺走，她从前也是国家级运动员。
    热情好客的东道主
    多特蒙德市政府为安排这场赛事的食宿、交通、安全等等，付出很多心血。休息这天，他们为记者安排了丰富多彩的游览项目：乘老式电车哐当哐当地游览市容，欣赏莫扎特的歌剧，夜逛种种风格不同的啤酒馆，还到一所古堡去吃了一顿中世纪晚餐。这里当然还有另一层意思，原来西德鲁尔区（包括多特蒙德、埃森、杜塞尔多夫、波鸿等城市）正争取主办２００４年的奥运会，宣传攻势已经开始。让你们看看我们的设施，我们的文化，我们一定会办得好！
    出色的电脑软件
    西德乒协委托巴登一家电脑软件公司专为本届大赛开发了一套软件，起了大作用。运动员简历、特点、比赛安排，成绩等等，一应俱全，随要随给。这套软件引起专业人士很大兴趣，下届世乒赛举办者日本的千叶市和１９９２年奥运主办者巴塞罗那市的代表打听得更为详细。
    兴旺的“国际贸易市场”
    比赛场地之外是一个熙熙攘攘的国际大市场，到处摆摊设市，训练服、提包、乒乓球拍、胶面，数不胜数。几大赞助公司大赛期间对折出售，最多达５０％。除此之外，还有一个小小的“国际黑市”，手工雕刻的木制胡椒瓶换运动服，咖啡换短汗衫、鱼子酱，香槟酒换……。据说东欧国家运动员最喜欢球拍的胶面，其它小礼品就更不在话下了。
