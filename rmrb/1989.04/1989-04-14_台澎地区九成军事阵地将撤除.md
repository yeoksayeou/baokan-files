Taiwan and Penghu regions will see the removal of nine-tenths of their military positions. According to a report from the New China News Agency in Hong Kong on April 13, the Taiwan military authorities plan to remove nine-tenths of the military positions in the Taiwan and Penghu regions and to allow "elected representatives" to be chosen by the end of this year in the military-controlled areas of Kinmen and Matsu.

Kinmen and Matsu are under military control, with people unable to enter or leave freely. Communications and transportation are controlled by the military, and township heads, township representatives, village heads, and even "National Assembly representatives" and "legislators" are all appointed by the "Military Administration Commission." Taiwan's "Minister of Defense," Cheng Wei-yuan, stated that elections for "elected representatives" will be allowed, but communications "for security reasons, will still not be open."

Currently, Taiwan has more than 300 military positions, including over 9,000 fortifications. The positions and fortifications that the authorities are considering to abolish are mainly bunkers and artillery positions.
