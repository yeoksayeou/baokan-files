After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, with the development and liberalization of the economy, brokerage activities, which had disappeared after the liberation, have revived. The number of people engaged in this field has rapidly increased, and their role in economic activities has become increasingly significant. However, several issues have emerged:

First, the name is not official, making it difficult to speak openly. According to estimates from relevant economic authorities in Hunan Province, there are more than 50,000 people engaged in brokerage activities in the province. Such a large group of people are all operating in an "underground" state, which is quite intriguing. They do not dare or are unwilling to openly disclose their business operations because, to this day, "brokerage" is still viewed by some as a way to earn illicit money. Additionally, the state has not yet officially issued regulations regarding the brokerage industry and brokerage activities, lacking clear legal definitions for the methods, means, scope, and responsibilities of brokerage activities. This makes it difficult for departments such as industry and commerce, and taxation to manage; they find it hard to regulate but also cannot ignore the issue. Brokerage personnel themselves also do not receive normal legal protection.

Second, there is a significant income disparity. Currently, those engaged in brokerage activities earn anywhere from tens of thousands of yuan to several hundred thousand yuan per year, and often evade taxes, resulting in a large income gap compared to other industries. The public has strong reactions to this. Due to the lack of unified regulations and a managing entity, some brokers arbitrarily increase their brokerage rates, with some reaching as high as twenty percent or more.

Third, there is still considerable confusion about the nature of the brokerage industry. Is it a "shell company," a "scam," or an information service? Or is it something else? What are the differences between brokerage activities and information services? How can we scientifically distinguish them in theory to guide practice? These issues need to be addressed urgently.

### 探一探“地下”经纪业

　　探一探“地下”经纪业
    党的十一届三中全会以后，随着经济的发展和搞活，解放后一度绝迹的经纪活动又复苏起来，而且从业人员迅速增多，在经济活动中所起的作用也越来越明显。但是，随之而来，又出现了以下种种问题：
    一、名未正言难顺。据湖南省有关经济方面人士估计，全省专门从事经纪业的人员在五万以上。如此庞大的队伍，却都处于“地下”状态，很耐人寻味。他们所以不敢或不愿公开自己的经营业务，是因为到现在为止，“经纪”仍被一些人视为是赚取昧心钱，而国家又还没有正式颁布有关经纪业和经纪活动的法规，对经纪活动的方式、手段、范围及责任义务等缺乏明确的法律规定，致使工商税务等部门也感到为难，管也不好管，不管又不行。经纪人自身也得不到正常的法律保护。
    二、收入差距大。目前从事经纪活动的，少则年收入上万元，多则数十万元，而且往往偷漏税，与其他行业相比，收入差距大，群众反映强烈。由于没有统一规定，也没有单位统管，有些经纪人任意提高经纪率，有的高达百分之二十乃至更多。
    三、对经纪业的性质，人们的认识还相当模糊。它究竟是“皮包公司”、“诈骗业”还是信息服务？抑或是别的什么？经纪业与皮包公司、经纪活动与信息服务之间有哪些区别？怎样从理论上科学划分以指导实践？种种问题，看来亟需解决了。　　　　　　　　　　　　（三月十三日《湖南日报》　陈勇文）
