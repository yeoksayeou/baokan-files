France has started using micro-surgery, or a new technology that combines micro-surgery with ultrasonic lithotripsy, to treat kidney stones. This new surgical method involves making only a tiny incision. With the aid of optical instruments and microscopes, surgical forceps are used to separate the stones, which are then removed through the incision. If the stones are located in areas that the forceps cannot reach, ultrasonic lithotripsy is used, and lasers are employed to clear any remaining fragments.

    法国开始采用微型手术，或与超声波碎石器并用的新技术治疗肾结石。这种新手术只切一微型口，借助光学仪和显微镜，用手术钳将结石剥离后，通过切口将结石吸出。如结石处于手术钳达不到的部位，则采用超声波碎石技术，并输入激光清除残迹。        　（芬）
