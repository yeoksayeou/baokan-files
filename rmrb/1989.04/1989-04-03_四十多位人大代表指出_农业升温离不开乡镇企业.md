Over 40 NPC deputies from township enterprises pointed out at a symposium held by the Ministry of Agriculture on April 2 that the revival of agriculture cannot do without township enterprises. During the rectification and adjustment, while addressing issues such as redundant construction in township enterprises, efforts should also be made to protect the healthy development of township enterprises.

Representatives from Shandong, Chang Zonglin, and Anhui, Zhu Chengyou, said: Where will the large amount of funds needed for the revival of agriculture come from? State investment is limited, and the accumulation capacity of planting industry is also low. Relying on township enterprises to support agriculture with industry and build agriculture with industry is one of the main channels for the revival of agriculture. The whole society should have a clear understanding of this.

Representatives pointed out in response to the current criticisms of township enterprises, such as "competing with large-scale industries for markets and raw materials," "producing low-quality, high-priced products," and "being the source of unhealthy trends," that while the unhealthy trends in township enterprises must be eliminated, they should not be used as grounds to negate the existence of township enterprises.

Representatives generally believe that township enterprises need to address the issue of resource and capital waste caused by redundant construction, but they hope the government will strengthen classified guidance and avoid a one-size-fits-all approach. They believe that adjustments should be based on the state's industrial policies rather than on whether an enterprise is state-owned or a township enterprise.

Minister He Kang said that in today's rural China, not only is there no stability without agriculture, but there is also no stability without industry. Supporting farmers in developing township enterprises is a state policy; during the rectification and adjustment, while emphasizing agriculture, one must also emphasize township enterprises. Agriculture and township enterprises are an inseparable whole. He also stressed that township enterprises should adjust their industrial structure and improve their quality, and should not become "empty giants."

### 四十多位人大代表指出  农业升温离不开乡镇企业

　　四十多位人大代表指出
    农业升温离不开乡镇企业
    本报讯  记者朱维群报道：４月２日，来自乡镇企业的４０多位人大代表，在农业部召开的座谈会上指出：农业升温离不开乡镇企业，在治理整顿中，既要解决乡镇企业重复建设等不良倾向，又要保护乡镇企业的健康发展。
    山东常宗琳、安徽朱成友等代表说：农业升温需要的大量资金投入从何而来？国家投入毕竟有限，种植业自身积累能力也低。依靠乡镇企业以工补农、以工建农，是农业升温的主要渠道之一。对此，全社会应有清醒的认识。
    代表们针对当前乡镇企业“与大工业争市场争原料”、“产品质次价高”、“是不正之风的源头”等说法指出，乡镇企业中的不正之风一定要清除，但是不能以此作为否定乡镇企业的根据。
    代表们普遍认为，乡镇企业需要解决重复建设带来的资金和资源浪费问题，但他们希望政府加强分类指导，不要一刀切。他们认为，调整应以国家的产业政策为依据，而不要以谁是国营、谁是乡镇企业为依据。
    何康部长说，今日中国农村，非但无农不稳，无工也不稳。支持农民发展乡镇企业是国家的既定方针；在治理整顿中，重视农业同时必须重视乡镇企业。农业同乡镇企业是一个不可分割的整体。他同时强调，乡镇企业要调整产业结构，提高素质，不要长成“虚胖子”。
