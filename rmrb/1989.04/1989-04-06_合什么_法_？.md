Title: What "Law" is Being Followed?

A reporter from the French newspaper *Le Figaro* recently interviewed Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and mentioned the atrocities committed by Israel in the occupied territories. In response, the defense minister openly stated: "I use these methods legally and do not violate international law. I believe these methods can reduce the flames from Molotov cocktails. According to the Geneva Conventions, we have the right to take such measures."

Rabin seems to be quite the expert on this, justifying Israel's actions as so reasonable and legal. Looking at the Geneva Conventions adopted in August 1949, one can't help but laugh. One of the main principles of the conventions is the prohibition of any killing, mutilation, harm to human dignity, hostage-taking, collective punishment, and execution without trial. It also prohibits attacks and harm to civilians and their property. However, everyone knows that the Israeli occupiers' suppression of the Palestinians in the occupied territories is exactly the kind of brutal conduct that violates these conventions. According to a report from the Palestinian News Agency at the end of February, since the start of the uprising against Israel on December 8, 1987, 600 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers, many of whom were women, children, and the elderly. Over 800 homes have been destroyed, more than 1,000 people have been injured, 30,000 have been arrested, and 23,000 have been wounded. Recently, the Israeli military even used helicopters to drop tear gas bombs, stones, and spray sewage to suppress the Palestinian resistance. Rabin actually claims that these actions and methods are in accordance with international law, which is a mockery of international law principles. Occupying someone else's land, committing violence against civilians there, and then talking about "international law" with blood on your hands—isn't Rabin being a bit too shameless?

The Geneva Conventions and other international laws cannot help the Israeli occupying forces. It would be better for Rabin and his ilk to change their brutal policies. Otherwise, the flames from the Molotov cocktails in the hands of the Palestinians will burn even higher and brighter.

### 合什么“法”？

　　合什么“法”？
    法国《费加罗报》记者最近在采访以色列国防部长拉宾时提及以色列在被占领土上犯下的暴行。对此，这位国防部长公然回答：“我使用这些手段是合法的，也不违反国际法。我认为这些手段可以减少燃烧瓶喷射的火焰。……根据日内瓦公约，我们有权采取这种措施。”
    张嘴“国际法”，闭口“日内瓦公约”，拉宾先生似乎真是这方面的行家，把以色列的行动美化得如此合理合法。找出１９４９年８月通过的日内瓦公约一看，不免哑然失笑。公约的主要原则之一就是禁止任何谋杀、伤残肢体、损害人的尊严、扣押人质、集体刑罚、未经审判而行刑，禁止攻击和伤害平民及其财产。然而，谁都知道，以色列占领者对付占领区的巴勒斯坦人的镇压正是干的这种违反公约的残暴行径。据巴勒斯坦通讯社２月底报道，自１９８７年１２月８日反以抗暴斗争以来，被占领土已有６００名巴勒斯坦人在以色列士兵的枪口下丧生，其中不少是妇孺翁妪，８００多座民房被毁，１０００多人致残，３万人被捕，２．３万人受伤。以色列军队最近甚至动用直升飞机投放催泪炸弹、石块和喷洒污水以镇压巴勒斯坦人的反抗斗争。拉宾居然把这些行为和手段说成是符合国际法，那简直是对国际法准则的嘲弄。占着人家的土地，施暴于那里的平民，双手沾着鲜血还要侈谈“国际法”云云，拉宾先生不是太厚颜了一点吗？
    日内瓦公约等国际法帮不了以色列占领军的忙。拉宾先生们还是以改变其暴虐政策为妙。否则，巴勒斯坦人手中燃烧瓶内喷射的火焰会更高、更旺。
