Edmonton, a city with a population of 785,500, is the capital of Alberta, a province in western Canada. Within this city lies the world's largest shopping and entertainment center, which Canadians call the "West Edmonton Mall."

In this sprawling complex, covering 483,000 square meters, there are over 800 commercial and service businesses. But that's not all. It also houses the world's largest indoor amusement park, the world's largest indoor water park, a zoo, an aquarium, nightclubs, casinos, churches, an arts and crafts museum, 110 restaurants and eateries of various cuisines, 19 cinemas, a hotel with 360 rooms, and a conference center that can accommodate 1,200 people. The total area of this region is equivalent to 115 football fields. Calling it a "commercial area" doesn't quite capture its essence, and labeling it a "shopping and entertainment center" is also not entirely accurate. More precisely, this place is a fully functional mini-city, as it employs 15,000 people.

One day in March, I visited this commercial city. Edmonton was still blanketed in snow, with temperatures hovering around -20 degrees Celsius. Yet inside, the city was lush with greenery, and flowers bloomed everywhere, exuding a vibrant energy. Customers and visitors, dressed in summer attire, either bustled between various shops or leisurely strolled in the park and by the fountains.

The world's largest indoor amusement park features a children's train, a merry-go-round, a roller coaster, and electric swings, among other attractions—over 20 in total. The most thrilling rides are the triple-loop roller coaster and the 13-story free-fall slide, which cater to the adventurous spirit of young people.

"The Undersea Adventure" is another major attraction in this commercial city. It features a 122-meter-long lake with a replica of the flagship from Columbus's fleet, named the "Satan's Maria." The ship is an impressive sight. Visitors can also board a submarine to explore the underwater world, observing over 200 marine species. There are four submarines, each capable of carrying 24 people.

The beach resort offers a tropical paradise. The 2-hectare beach gradually slopes into deeper water, giving the feeling of walking from the shore into the sea. Artificial waves allow people to enjoy surfing on boogie boards, much like they would in Hawaii. The beach is surrounded by tropical banana trees and small round tables under beach umbrellas for snacks. The spacious beach maintains a tropical temperature of 30 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the beach area features a 26-meter-high water slide, water chute, various small pools, and over 30 facilities for children to play.

The prosperity of commerce reflects the economic development. The establishment of the West Edmonton Mall is a result of the booming oil industry in Alberta. With a population of 2.4 million, Alberta is Canada's fourth-largest province and the country's most important oil base and a major grain-producing province.

Construction of this commercial city began in 1981, with a total investment of 1.1 billion Canadian dollars. Just the parking lot around the mall can accommodate 20,000 cars simultaneously, giving a sense of the scale of this world's largest shopping and entertainment center.

But is building such a massive commercial city economically viable? The commercial city's news center provided me with a set of statistics:

Firstly, the construction of this project provided employment for 100,000 people, and after completion, it offered long-term employment for 15,000 workers. Secondly, statistics show that from 1982 to 1986, Edmonton's tourism revenue increased from 200 million to 700 million Canadian dollars, with a significant portion of this revenue generated by the West Edmonton Mall.

According to statistics from July 1987, in the past year, the West Edmonton Mall welcomed 20 million visitors, including 9.2 million foreign tourists. To accommodate this influx, the mall built a number of new hotels in 1986. Currently, the mall's operators are confident in the continued prosperity of their business, firmly believing in the further development of this commercial city.

　　城中之城
    郭文福
    埃德蒙顿，这个７８．５５万人口的城市，是加拿大西部阿尔伯达省的省会。这里有一个世界上最大的购物和娱乐中心，加拿大人把它叫作“西埃德蒙顿商业区”。
    其实在这块占地４８．３万平方米的连体建筑中，除了８００多家商业和服务业商店外，还有一个世界上最大的室内游乐园、世界上最大的室内海滨浴场，以及动物园、水族馆、夜总会、赌场、教堂、工艺品博物馆、１１０家各种风味餐馆和饮食店、１９家影剧院，同时还有一家拥有３６０个房间的旅馆和可容纳１２００人的会议中心，等等。至于这片总面积足有１１５个足球场大小的地区称之为“商业区”实在不达其意，叫它“购物和娱乐中心”也不完全准确。准确点讲，这块地方本身就是一个功能齐全的小城，因为这里的工作人员即达１．５万人。
    今年３月中的一天，我来到这座商业城。埃德蒙顿仍大雪盖地，气温在零下２０度，但城内却绿树葱葱，各类花卉到处可见，一片盎然生机。身着夏装的顾客和游人或川流于各类店铺之间，或悠闲在街心花园和喷泉等清静之处。
    世界上最大的室内游乐园里有儿童火车，旋转木马，滑行铁路和电动秋千等各类游乐项目２０多种。其中最有刺激性的要称可以大回环三周的滑行铁路和有１３层楼那么高的自由落体滑梯。这当然是满足青年人好胜和好奇心的地方。
    “海底猎奇”是这座商业城里的又一大景观。这是一个有１２２米长的湖，湖面上有一艘名为“撒旦·玛丽亚”的古式帆船，它是哥伦布当年环球旅行船队旗舰的原型复制品，气势十分可观。游人也可以乘上潜艇到６米深的水下一游，观看２００余种海生动物。这里供游人海底猎奇的潜艇共有４艘，每艘可乘２４个人。
    海滨浴场一派热带风光。面积达２公顷的浴场由浅入深，使人感到是从海滩走入海中。人为制造的巨大海浪，使许多人脚踩冲浪板，能够在那里享受在夏威夷海滨才能得到的乐趣。浴场的周围有热带的芭蕉树，也有供游人小吃的太阳伞下的小圆桌。宽敞的浴场内总是保持着零上３０度的热带气温。此外，浴场周围还建有高达２６米的水滑梯、滑水管道、各类小浴池及供儿童玩耍的设施共３０余处。
    商业的繁荣反映了经济的发达。西埃德蒙顿这座商业城的建立是阿尔伯达省石油工业蓬勃发展的结果。拥有２４０万人口的阿尔伯达省是加拿大的第四大省，是加拿大最重要的石油基地和重要的产粮省份之一。
    据介绍，这座商业城是从１９８１年开始修建的，总投资达１１亿加元。仅商场四周的停车场就可同时停２万辆小汽车，这一个数字也可以使人大致上想象出这个世界最大的购物和娱乐中心的规模。
    那么，修建这么一个巨大的商业城经济上是否合算呢？商业城新闻中心向我提供了一套统计数字：
    首先，修建这一工程给１０万人提供了就业机会，建成后又给１．５万职工提供长期就业位置。其次，据统计自１９８２至１９８６年埃德蒙顿市的旅游收入从２亿加元增至７亿加元，其中大部分是西埃德蒙顿商业城赚取的。
    据１９８７年７月底的统计，在过去的一年中西埃德蒙顿商业城共接待顾客２０００万人，其中有９２０万是外国旅游者。为此，商业城在１９８６年还新建成了一批旅馆。目前，商业城的经营者对日益兴隆的生意颇有信心，他们对这座商业城的进一步繁荣确信无疑。
