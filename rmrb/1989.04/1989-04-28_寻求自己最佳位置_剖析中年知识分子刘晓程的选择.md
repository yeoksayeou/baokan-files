**Seeking One's Optimal Position – An Analysis of Middle-Aged Intellectual Liu Xiaocheng's Choice**

**Liu Xiaocheng: His Person and His Story**

Liu Xiaocheng is 40 years old this year. Summarizing his person and his story doesn't take many words: He dropped out of high school and went to "Beidahuang" (the Greater Northern Wilderness) for rural re-education. Later, as a "worker-peasant-soldier student," he studied at Harbin Medical University. After graduating, he was admitted to the graduate program of the Beijing Fuwai Hospital, a subsidiary of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, under the renowned heart surgeon Guo Jiagang, becoming his favored disciple. In 1982, after obtaining his master's degree, he stayed on at the hospital. In June 1984 to the end of 1985, he went to the renowned cardiovascular hospital in Australia, the Prince Charles Hospital, for further study, achieving outstanding results. Upon his return, he was promoted to attending physician and took charge of the coronary heart disease ward at "Fuwai."

Everything seemed to be going smoothly. However, in May 1987, he suddenly requested a transfer from "Fuwai" to the frontier of cardiovascular surgery—Mudanjiang City in Heilongjiang Province—to "create something."

His request for a transfer immediately caused a strong reaction at "Fuwai"!

**Calm Broken by Contrast**

Australia. The beautiful city of Brisbane. The well-equipped Prince Charles Hospital. It was on this foreign land that Liu Xiaocheng first had the thought of leaving "Fuwai"!

Study, research, discussion, surgery... Liu Xiaocheng quickly discovered: Here, everyone's abilities are respected. As long as you have the capability, you can fully utilize it. Age and seniority are not considered; as long as you have evidence, students can challenge their elders and mentors without hesitation. The seniors not only do not feel "losing face," but also genuinely appreciate and praise the young.

Soon, he had a personal experience. In Australia, foreign trainees could only observe surgeries or assist in surgeries as temporary registered doctors. This restricted Liu Xiaocheng—how could a heart surgeon improve without operating? His mentor, the internationally renowned cardiovascular surgeon Dr. O'Brien, resolutely broke the rules and pushed this diligent Chinese student to the forefront. Over a year and a half, Liu Xiaocheng participated in more than 500 surgeries for various heart and major blood vessel diseases, and even performed 40 surgeries as the main surgeon, including congenital heart disease, valve pain, and high-difficulty "coronary artery bypass" surgeries.

Liu Xiaocheng was a bit surprised: He could do so many things, do such difficult things. From this, he realized that he did not truly understand himself. He calmed down and thought: If these things were done in China, he could also do them!

During his years at "Fuwai," although he had studied to the level of a graduate student and had many years of practical experience, he was still considered "inexperienced" at the age of over thirty. Many things were not within his reach. By the time they were, the best time might have passed. Thinking of this, he felt a bit frightened. He further pondered: Where is the optimal position to fully utilize his abilities? The thought of "leaving Fuwai while still young" suddenly flashed through his mind!

Where to go? He knew that there were 600 million heart disease patients nationwide, 300 million of whom needed surgery, but all the hospitals capable of performing heart surgeries were in large cities...

"Go to the lower levels!" Liu Xiaocheng quickly made his decision.

The study abroad ended. Dr. O'Brien was reluctant to let go of this "hardworking, humble, and clever" student. "Stay," he said to Liu Xiaocheng, "continue your doctoral studies, bring your wife to accompany you, and bring your child as well. I will arrange for him to study at the best primary school in the area."

Liu Xiaocheng was very grateful but politely declined.

**Request for Transfer**

Requesting a transfer was a big deal and had to be discussed with his wife.

Liu Xiaocheng's wife, Hong Yishu, was also a medical student. Both of their hometowns were in Jiamusi, Heilongjiang. Not long after Liu Xiaocheng returned from Australia, Hong Yishu's household registration was finally transferred to Beijing, and she was assigned to work at the Beijing Post and Telecommunications Hospital, also being promoted to attending physician. Later, they were allocated a two-bedroom apartment, and their son was enrolled in a well-equipped primary school.

However, Liu Xiaocheng told his wife that he wanted to give up all these hard-earned things and go to Mudanjiang, Heilongjiang. He had gone there for mobile medical services before, and due to climate and other reasons, the incidence of heart disease there was higher than the national average. However, there was no leader in cardiovascular surgery, and many patients had no access to treatment...

Hong Yishu was taken aback at first. But she understood her husband and also knew the responsibilities of this generation. Therefore, Hong Yishu understood.

On May 13, 1987, Liu Xiaocheng wrote a 3,000-word request for transfer and submitted it to the hospital's party committee and Director Guo Jiagang.

He wrote: I am determined to give up the superior material and cultural conditions in Beijing and apply to work at Dong'an Hospital in Mudanjiang City. Please understand, support, and approve this request. If it is firmly rejected, I will have no choice but to choose the path of resignation!

Persuasion, retention, all were ineffective. The hospital had no choice but to let him go.

23 days later, Liu Xiaocheng left Beijing.

**Sweet, Sour, Bitter, Spicy**

The day after arriving in Mudanjiang, he performed his first cardiovascular surgery. Now, a year and eight months have passed, and he has performed heart surgeries for more than 280 patients, with a success rate of 96%. On January 9 this year, he also performed a high-difficulty "coronary artery bypass" surgery on a 53-year-old patient, setting a precedent in Heilongjiang Province...

"Sweet, sour, bitter, spicy, I've tasted all the flavors," Liu Xiaocheng reminisced. "But undoubtedly, this is also the most fulfilling and meaningful year and eight months."

Mudanjiang is a "virgin land" for cardiovascular surgery, and Dong'an Hospital is a poorly equipped district-level hospital. From training personnel, performing surgeries, to seeking funds, and adding facilities, everything had to be arranged by Liu Xiaocheng. Not everyone was enthusiastic, and he was also kicked around like a ball. Housing was also not immediately solved, so he had to temporarily live in the office. His child looked at his father: "Beijing is so good, let's go back to Beijing!"

Liu Xiaocheng felt a bit bitter. But whenever he thought of the patients he had cured from nine provinces, he felt a sweet aftertaste. In the ward, seven or eight patients saw the reporter and all rushed to speak. "It's hard to find a doctor like Liu!" "He didn't stay in Beijing, all for us." "Heart disease is hard to treat, we've been enduring it for years, now Liu has come and cured our disease!"...

Wang Kezhong, the deputy head of the Propaganda Department of Suifenhe City, was only 34 years old and had been tormented by congenital heart disease, relying on medication to survive. On March 11 last year, Liu Xiaocheng operated on him, and twenty-something days later, Wang Kezhong was discharged and returned to work like a normal person. He tearfully hung a plaque reading "Land of Rebirth" in the hospital.

Those who were carried in, walked out; those who came with worried faces, left with smiles; especially the children, who could not move before the surgery, could jump and play after the surgery—seeing these, Liu Xiaocheng's heart could not be sweet?

More than a dozen young people who graduated from medical schools in recent years did not go to large cities or stay in large hospitals, but actively came to Liu Xiaocheng. Now, Liu Xiaocheng has a group of capable assistants around him—this, could it not inspire him?

Heilongjiang Province and Mudanjiang City have jointly invested 74.6 million yuan to strive to complete the construction of the "Mudanjiang Cardiovascular Disease Hospital" building this year. Provincial Party Secretary Sun Weiben said: "Cut down on buildings, but this project must be protected."

All these things warmed Liu Xiaocheng's heart.

**Eight Questions and Eight Answers with the Reporter**

**Q: You came down, but why do many middle-aged and young intellectuals who have similar feelings want to come down but can't?**

**A:** Coming down requires courage, having some real skills, a bit of sacrifice, and a bit of risk awareness. To be honest, coming down is definitely not as easy as staying up there, but coming down is definitely more fulfilling than staying up there. Life is about creation, and it's better to take action and forge your own path than to be frustrated and wandering, blaming heaven and people.

**Q: What if you fail?**

**A:** Of course, there is that possibility. I think failing in creation is also a gain, a wealth. I have a view that Chinese intellectuals have too strong a sense of "success" and too narrow an understanding of "success."

**Q: Will coming from a big place to a small place affect research?**

**A:** There will be some impact. I was in charge of the national "Seventh Five-Year Plan" key research project on coronary heart disease clinical and research at "Fuwai." After coming to Mudanjiang, this work was temporarily suspended. But when the building is completed and the conditions are met, research work can continue.

**Q: You have done many surgeries since coming down, from the perspective of improving skills, is each surgery not just a simple repetition?**

**A:** No. Each person's condition will not be exactly the same. Besides, I have done many high-difficulty surgeries, like "bypass surgery," which I would not have the chance to do at "Fuwai." This is indeed a great training for me.

**Q: Now that science and technology are developing rapidly, how do you avoid becoming outdated in this relatively isolated place like Mudanjiang?**

**A:** The key is not to be self-sealed. I have contacted relevant departments, and everyone is very supportive. The Beijing China International Book Trading Corporation introduces the latest books on cardiovascular diseases from around the world to me, and the largest import document copying company in the country, located in Xi'an, also helps me. I maintain close contact with "Fuwai" and also frequently communicate with my Australian mentor and some experts from other countries. If conditions permit, I will invite them to visit, and I will also go abroad to see.

**Q: Why choose Mudanjiang, this "virgin land" of cardiovascular surgery?**

**A:** Starting from zero, unconstrained, everything can be done according to one's own intentions.

**Q: How do you think young people should handle their relationship with mentors and elders?**

**A:** I think young people must respect their mentors and elders; they have many valuable things worth learning from. But what needs to be clarified is that this is different from young people fully utilizing their own abilities.

**Q: Is the income more after coming down?**

**A:** I still receive my salary. I didn't come down for the money; for the money, I would have stayed in Australia long ago.

Liu Xiaocheng, through his answers, has been promoted to the rank of chief physician. At the end of last year, he was also approved by the State Science and Technology Commission and the Ministry of Personnel as a young and middle-aged expert with outstanding contributions.

"The road ahead is still long," Liu Xiaocheng said. "Whether it will definitely be successful is still uncertain. But I will continue to move forward. Only by moving forward will there be a path."

　　寻求自己最佳位置   
    ——剖析中年知识分子刘晓程的选择
    新华社记者  张持坚
    刘晓程其人其事
    刘晓程今年４０岁。概括其人其事，用不了多少话：高中没毕业，到“北大荒”上山下乡。后来作为“工农兵学员”，到哈尔滨医科大学学习。毕业后考取中国医学科学院北京阜外医院院长郭加强的研究生，成为这位心外科专家的得意门生。１９８２年获硕士学位后，留院工作。１９８４年６月到１９８５年底，赴澳大利亚著名的心血管专科医院——查理王子医院深造，成绩突出。回来后晋升主治医师，又担任了“阜外”冠心外科病区的负责人。
    一切看上去都很顺利。然而，１９８７年５月，他突然提出调离“阜外”，到心脏外科一片空白的边疆——黑龙江省牡丹江市去“创一番事业”。
    他的请调顿时在“阜外”引起了强烈的震荡！
    平静被反差打破
    澳大利亚。美丽的布里斯班市。条件优越的查理王子医院。刘晓程离开“阜外”的念头正是在这片异国的土地上萌生的！
    进修，学习，研讨，手术……刘晓程很快发现：这里尊重每一个人的才干，只要你有能力，就可以充分发挥。不讲年龄，也不排资历，只要言之有据，学生可以毫无顾虑地向长者和导师挑战。前辈们不仅不会觉得“丢面子”，还会由衷地感谢和赞扬年轻人。
    不久，他更有了亲身体验。在澳大利亚，外国进修生只能以临时注册医生的身份参观手术或做手术中的助手。这使刘晓程受到了限制——心脏外科医生不操刀，谈何提高？他的导师、国际知名心血管外科专家奥布莱恩博士毅然破例把这位勤奋的中国学生推到了前台。在一年多的时间里，刘晓程参加了５００多例各种心脏及大血管疾病的手术，还担任主刀，做了４０多例先天性心脏病、瓣膜痛和高难度的“冠状动脉搭桥”手术。
    刘晓程有点惊奇：自己原来还能干这么多的事，干这么难的事。由此，他发现，自己并不真正了解自己。他静下心来想：这些事如果在国内让我做，我也能做！
    在“阜外”的那些年，尽管他读到研究生毕业，又有多年的实践经验，也三十好几了，可还是被认为“嫩”。很多事情轮不到自己干。等轮到的时候，好时光怕早就过去了。想到这里，他不免有些后怕。他进一步思量着：施展自己能力的最佳位置在哪里？“趁还年轻，离开阜外”一个念头忽然闪将出来！
    到哪儿去？他了解全国心脏病人有６００万，需要作手术的３００万，可现有能作心脏手术的医院都在大城市……
    “到下面去！”刘晓程很快下了决心。
    进修结束了，奥布莱恩博士舍不得这个“工作努力，谦虚机敏”的学生。“留下来，”他对刘晓程说：“继续攻读博士学位，把夫人接来陪读，把孩子也接来，我安排他到当地最好的小学读书。”
    刘晓程很感激，但婉言谢绝了。
    请调
    请调毕竟是件大事，得和妻子商量。
    刘晓程的妻子洪依舒，也是学医的。他俩的老家都在黑龙江佳木斯市。刘晓程从澳大利亚回国不久，小洪的户口终于进了北京，并被安排到北京邮电医院工作，还晋升为主治医师。以后，他们又分到了一套两居室的住房，儿子也进了一所条件优越的小学。
    然而，刘晓程对妻子讲，他想抛弃这来之不易的一切，到黑龙江牡丹江市去。他去那儿搞过巡回医疗，由于气候等原因，那里心脏病的发病率高于全国平均数，可是没有心脏外科的带头人，做不了这方面的手术，许许多多患者求医无门……
    洪依舒一时感到很突然。但她了解自己的丈夫，也懂得这一代人应负的职责。因此，洪依舒想得通。
    １９８７年５月１３日，刘晓程写下３０００余字的请调报告，递给了医院党委和郭加强院长。
    他写道：我决心抛弃北京优越的物质文化条件，申请到牡丹江市东安医院工作，请院党委和院长予以理解、支持和批准。如坚决不允，我只好选择辞职这条路了！
    劝说，挽留，一切无效。院里无可奈何，只好放行。
    ２３天后，刘晓程离开了北京。
    甜、酸、苦、辣
    到牡丹江的第二天，他做了第一例心脏外科手术。如今，一年又八个月过去了，他已经为２８０多位病人做了心脏手术，成功率达９６％。今年１月９日，他还为一名５３岁的患者做了难度很高的“冠状动脉搭桥术”，开了黑龙江省这方面手术的先例……
    “甜、酸、苦、辣，啥滋味都尝到了。”刘晓程回味说：“不过，毫无疑问，这也是最充实、最有意义的一年零八个月。”
    牡丹江是心脏外科的“处女地”，东安医院又是一所条件简陋的区级医院。从培训人员，操刀手术，到寻求资金，添置设施，全靠刘晓程张罗。并非人人都是“热面孔”，他也像皮球一样被踢过。住房又一时解决不了，只好暂住办公室。孩子眼睁睁地看着爸爸：“北京多好，咱回北京吧！”
    刘晓程心里酸酸的。但一想到治好了来自９个省的病人，便回味犹甘。病房里，七八个患者见记者来访，都抢着说话。“难得刘大夫的热心呀！”“北京不呆，还不是为我们。”“心脏病不好治，我们都熬好几年了，现在刘大夫来了，把我们的病治好了！”……
    绥芬河市委宣传部副部长王克忠才３４岁，被先天性心脏病折磨苦了，一直靠药顶着。去年３月１１日，刘晓程为他动了手术，二十几天后，王克忠像正常人一样出院上班了。他含泪把一面上书“再生之地”的锦旗挂进医院。
    抬进来的，走回去了；愁眉苦脸来的，喜笑颜开地回去了；尤其是孩子，手术前像小老头似的不敢活动，手术后能蹦能跳了——刘晓程看到这些，心里能不甜吗？
    十几个近年医科院校毕业的年轻人，大城市不去，大医院不留，主动奔刘晓程来了。现在，刘晓程周围已有一批得力的助手——这，能不鼓舞他吗？
    黑龙江省和牡丹江市已联合投资７４６万元，争取今年内把“牡丹江心血管病医院”大楼盖起来。省委书记孙维本说：“楼堂馆所要砍，这个项目要保。”
    这种种都焐热了刘晓程的一颗心。
    记者与刘晓程的八问八答
    问：你下来了，为什么有不少和你有同样感受的中青年知识分子想下又下不来呢？
    答：下来，一要有勇气，二要掌握些真本领，三要有点牺牲精神，四要有点风险意识。老实说，下来确实不如在上面“日子好过”，但下来一定比在上面充实。人生就是创造，与其在那儿苦闷彷徨，怨天尤人，不如拿出行动，自己闯出一条路来。
    问：万一失败呢？
    答：当然有这个可能。我觉得在创造中失败了，也是一种收获，一种财富。我有一个看法，中国知识分子“成功”的意识太强了，对“成功”的理解也太狭窄了。
    问：从大地方到小地方，会不会影响科研？
    答：会有一些影响，我在“阜外”主抓国家“七五”期间冠心病临床与科研的重点攻关项目。到牡丹江后，这项工作暂时停下来了。但等大楼盖起来，条件具备了，研究工作还可以继续进行。
    问：你下来手术做得很多，从提高业务的角度看，一次次手术是不是简单的重复？
    答：不是的。每个人的病情不会完全一样。另外，我还做了不少难度较高的手术，像“搭桥术”，要在“阜外”是轮不到我做的，这对我确实是很大的锻炼。
    问：现在科学技术发展很快，在牡丹江这个相对闭塞的地方，怎样避免“落伍”？
    答：关键是不要自我封闭。我与有关部门取得联系，大家都很支持。北京中国图书进出口总公司把世界上最新的心血管方面的书籍介绍给我，设在西安的全国最大的一家进口资料复印公司也帮助我。我与“阜外”保持着密切联系，与澳大利亚导师和其他一些国家的一些专家也经常通信，有条件还要请他们来访，我也要到国外去看看。
    问：为什么要选择牡丹江这片“心脏外科”的处女地？
    答：从零开始，不受约束，一切可以按照自己的意图放手干。
    问：你觉得年轻人应该怎样处理好与导师、长者的关系？
    答：我认为对导师、长者一定要尊重，他们有许多宝贵的东西值得年轻人学习。但这里需要搞清楚的是，它和年轻人充分发挥自己的才干是两回事。
    问：下来收入是不是多一些？
    答：我还拿我的一份工资。我下来不是为了钱，为钱，我早就留在澳大利亚了。
    刘晓程通过答辩，已破格晋升为主任医师。去年年底，又被国家科委和人事部批准为有突出贡献的中青年专家。
    “今后的路还很长。”刘晓程说：“是不是一定能走成功，还不好说。不过，我要继续往前走。走，才有路。”
