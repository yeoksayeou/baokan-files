	Protecting the "Lungs of the Earth":
	Brazil Implements the Amazon Conservation Plan

	People's Daily reporter Lan Caiji reports from Brasilia: On April 6, Brazilian President Sarney officially announced a comprehensive plan to protect the natural environment and ecology of the Amazon—“Our Nature Plan.” At the presidential palace, the "Palácio da Alvorada," he stated that to implement this plan, Brazil is prepared to accept international cooperation and aid without any pressure or interference in its sovereignty. He firmly rejected suggestions from some Western countries and certain international organizations to convert part of its debt into Amazon conservation investments.

	The key points of the “Our Nature Plan” include: establishing a relatively complete Amazon conservation system, organizing relevant agencies to strengthen their inspection, research, and management of the region; expanding Amazon conservation areas and indigenous reserves; imposing new restrictive regulations on agricultural, livestock, and mining development in the region, as well as timber logging and the use of chemical pesticides; launching nationwide environmental education and propaganda campaigns to increase public awareness and knowledge of ecological conservation. To ensure the implementation of this plan, the Brazilian government has decided to establish an Environmental Committee consisting of nine cabinet ministers and a National Environmental Protection Foundation. This year, it aims to raise 1.78 billion new cruzeiros (equivalent to $1.78 billion) for environmental investments.

　　巴西实施亚马孙环保计划
    本报巴西利亚电　记者兰才基报道：巴西总统萨尔内４月６日正式宣布了一项保护亚马孙自然环境和生态的综合性计划——“我们的大自然计划”。他在总统府“高原宫”宣布计划时说，为实施这项计划，巴西准备接受不带任何压力和干涉主权的国际合作和援助，决不同意一些西方国家和某些国际组织提出的将部分债务转换成亚马孙环保投资的建议。
    “我们的大自然计划”要点包括：建立一个比较完善的亚马孙环保体制，组织有关机构加强对这一地区的考察、研究和管理工作；扩大亚马孙环保区和印第安人保护区；对该地区的农牧业和矿业开发，以及原木采伐、化学药物的使用等作出新的限制性规定；开展全国性的环保宣传教育活动，增加人民对保护生态环境的自觉性和知识等。为了保证这一计划的实施，巴西政府确定成立由９名内阁部长参加的环境委员会和全国环保基金会，今年内筹集１．７８亿新克鲁扎多的款项（合１．７８亿美元）用于环保投资。
