The Allure of the Blue Sky

You always yearn to go there. The sky there is incredibly vast. Under that vast and somewhat mysterious sky, there are towering ice peaks and a glittering world of snow. Perhaps it is the effect of the snow, or perhaps it is because there is no pollution, the sky there is bluer and deeper than the inland sky. The clouds in the sky are whiter and more beautiful than those inland. It is so captivating that you can hardly resist its allure.

Your mind is filled with countless pieces of information from there, each one becoming a temptation in your heart. You heard that several years ago, an "old border guard" rode a camel into the mountains from the southern border. When he set out, the apricot blossoms were in full bloom, and when he returned, the apricots were ripe, yet he only stayed at his destination for a couple of days. After the Xinjiang-Tibet Highway was built, one could take a car to go up the mountain. Cars are much faster than camels, but even so, it takes at least half a month to go up the mountain once. You learned that in that place, the average altitude is over four thousand meters, with virtually no natural vegetation, not even the hardy red willow. The army's supplies have to be transported from the southern border. The journey takes a long time, the conditions are poor, and the car bounces around a lot. Even if the freshest vegetables are brought, they will rot by the time they reach the mountain. Due to the long-term lack of fresh vegetables, many soldiers' health has deteriorated. You also heard that there is a long period of ice sealing, during which all transportation is cut off. Not only can you not see newspapers, but if you get seriously ill, you cannot get treatment...

You cannot tolerate the fact that advanced science and technology can send those massive objects into space, yet this piece of sky in our motherland is still in a primitive state, with only howling winds, rolling clouds, and snowflakes fighting, and no traces of human aviation technology. This fact deeply stirred you, and you vowed to venture into that mysterious airspace, to break its primitive state, and to carve the first flight path in history.

You are an "old pilot," of course, you know that the path to venturing into that airspace is fraught with danger: you don't know how the winds and clouds will change, you don't know how many complex situations you will encounter. You said, you were born in the "Death Sea" of the Taklamakan Desert, grew up in the seemingly impossible Lop Nur, and are naturally brave and love adventure. However, for the sake of caution, you use your brain to think: imagine, compare. Creative imagination helps you construct a strange sky in a place you are familiar with. In the imagined sky, you simulate training, and you actually feel that the mysterious sky is not so mysterious.

One day, you really went there, crossing the Tianshan Mountains and the Kunlun Mountains. Thus, the sky that had been silent for thousands of years appeared with a new and pleasant sound: "Roar, roar, roar..." This sound awakened the ice peaks that had been sleeping for a thousand years, awakened the rivers and streams, and awakened the sacred mountains and lakes that pilgrims worship... You, succeeded.

　　蓝天的诱惑
    刘新权
    你总渴望到那里去。那里的天空无比辽阔。在那辽阔的多少带有神秘色彩的天空下，是高高隆起的冰峰大坂，是晶莹闪亮的冰雪世界。也许是冰雪这种物质起的作用，也许是不曾有脏物污染的缘故，那片天空比内地的瓦蓝，比内地的深邃，天空中的云朵比内地的洁白，比内地的美丽。太吸引人了，你简直抵挡不了它的诱惑。
    你的头脑里装了许许多多来自那里的信息，每一个信息都在心里变成一个诱惑。你听说，数年以前，一位“老边防”从南疆骑骆驼上山，出发时杏花正盛开，归来时杏子已成熟，而他在目的地只停留了短短两天时间。新藏公里修成后，上山可坐汽车。汽车比骆驼快得多，但上一次山至少也得半个月。你了解到，那个地方，平均海拔高度四千多米，基本没有自然植被，连生命力特强的红柳都不长，部队吃的要从南疆拉。路途时间长，情况不好，汽车颠簸厉害，即使拉最新鲜的蔬菜，到了山上也都腐烂了。由于长时间吃不上新鲜蔬菜，不少战士体质下降。你还听说，那里有漫长的冰封期，封期一切交通断绝，不要说看不到报纸，有了重病也得不到治疗……
    你不能忍受这样一个事实：发达的科学技术可以把那些庞然大物送上太空，可祖国的这片天空却仍然处于原始状态，只有狂风奔突，云浪翻滚，雪花厮杀，而没有人类航空技术留下的任何痕迹。这个事实深深地刺激了你，你发誓，一定要去闯一闯那个神秘的空域，去划破它的原始状态，去刻下有史以来的第一道航迹。
    你是“老飞”，当然知道闯那个空域的道路充满艰险：不知道风云怎样变幻，不知道会遇见多少复杂的情况。你说，你生在被称为“死亡之海”的塔克拉玛干大沙漠，长在使人觉得不可思议的罗布泊，生性勇敢，喜欢冒险。不过，为了慎重起见，你运用大脑思维：设想、对比。创造性的想象帮助你在你熟悉的地方构筑了一个陌生的天空。在想象中的天空中模拟训练，居然使你觉得那个神秘的天空不那么神秘了。
    有一天，你真的去了那里，越过天山，越过昆仑。于是，那片古久以来寂静的天空出现了一种新奇的动听的声音：“轰轰轰，轰轰轰……”这声音惊醒了千年沉睡的冰峰大坂，惊醒了冰水长流的大河小溪，惊醒了那个为香客顶礼膜拜的神山神湖……你，成功了。
