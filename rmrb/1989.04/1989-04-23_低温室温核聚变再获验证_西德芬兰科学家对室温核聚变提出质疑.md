Low-Temperature Room-Temperature Nuclear Fusion Verified Again

West German and Finnish Scientists Question Room-Temperature Nuclear Fusion

	ROME, April 23 (Xinhua) — A research team led by physicist Professor Scalamucci of the Italian National Commission for Alternative Energy has conducted "cold" nuclear fusion experiments in the laboratory using new physical methods. Chairman Umberto Colombo of the Italian National Commission for Alternative Energy and Professor Scalamucci held a press conference here on the morning of April 18 to officially announce the above news.

	The Scalamucci team's experimental method involves soaking titanium in heavy water containing deuterium (an isotope of hydrogen), applying high pressure (about 8 atmospheres) and low temperature (around -120 degrees Celsius) to turn the liquid into a gas, allowing deuterium to penetrate the titanium structure, thus causing nuclear fusion and releasing hundreds of neutrons per second. This experiment showed good results during the tests conducted from April 7 to 10 and from April 15 to 16.

	Experts believe that the Scalamucci team's method of producing neutrons by applying high pressure and low temperature to deuterium and titanium is more convenient and effective than the electrolysis method used by American scientists.

	BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) — Scientists from East Germany and Brazil have successfully conducted low-temperature nuclear fusion experiments.

	According to a report from the German News Agency, a research team at the Dresden University of Technology successfully conducted a nuclear fusion experiment at room temperature on the night of April 18. They introduced an electric current into the heavy water electrolyte through a palladium electrode (cathode) and a platinum electrode (anode). The results measured by the neutron spectrometer indicated that a deuterium-deuterium nuclear fusion reaction occurred, releasing 0.02 neutrons per second with an energy of 2.45 mega-electron volts on the platinum electrode. This team repeated the experiment multiple times within the temperature range of 0.09 degrees Celsius and -0.09 degrees Celsius.

	According to foreign news reports, scientists from the Brazilian Nuclear Energy Research Institute and the University of São Paulo also successfully conducted a nuclear fusion experiment on April 18. The experiment was conducted at room temperature, and neutron release was observed. The energy produced in the reaction was 8 times the energy consumed.

	PRAGUE, April 21 (Xinhua) — According to a report from the Czech News Agency, a team led by Professor Pavel Povenec of the Department of Mathematical Physics at Comenius University in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, achieved room-temperature nuclear fusion on April 17. They recorded high-energy neutrons released during the deuterium nuclear fusion reaction using highly sensitive detection equipment when using palladium as an electrode to electrolyze heavy water in laboratory conditions.

	Experts from Comenius University are continuing to explore more favorable reactions for energy release. They plan to use tritium to replace palladium as the electrode.

	BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) — West German and Finnish scientists have recently questioned the room-temperature nuclear fusion experiments conducted by British and American scientists, believing that the experimental results do not confirm the occurrence of nuclear fusion.

	At a press conference on April 20, Professor Max of the Free University of Berlin and Professor Kreiss of the Chemical Equipment Association stated that based on the situation shown in the experiments conducted by Stanley Pons and Fleischmann, it is not yet possible to say that there is a "definitive reason" to indicate that nuclear fusion has occurred. They may not have measured gamma rays in the experiment but only measured the radon emitted by the laboratory walls. Additionally, they did not conduct "comparative neutron measurements." Regarding the tritium observed in the experiment, it was already present in the heavy water used.

	According to a report in a Finnish newspaper on April 20, Antti Niemi, a researcher at the European Nuclear Research Center and former president of the Helsinki University of Technology, believes that the similar experiments conducted at the European Nuclear Research Center last week indicate that the relevant reactions are very ordinary phenomena. The energy released in the experiment is not from nuclear fusion but is likely due to the liquefaction of gaseous substances. He said that the low-temperature nuclear fusion experiment conducted at the University of Utah in the United States lacks key neutron measurements.

	The Finnish National Technical Research Center began verifying the results of the University of Utah in mid-April, and the experiment was temporarily suspended after no results were obtained.

　　低温室温核聚变再获验证    
    西德芬兰科学家对室温核聚变提出质疑
    本报罗马电  记者罗晋标报道：以物理学家斯卡拉穆奇教授为首的意大利国家替代能源委员会科研小组，以新的物理方法在实验室里进行了“冷”核聚变。意大利国家替代能源委员会主席翁伯托·科隆博和斯卡拉穆奇教授１８日上午在这里举行记者招待会正式宣布了上述消息。
    斯卡拉穆奇小组试验方法是：把钛浸泡在含有氘（氢的同位素）的重水里，施以高压（约８个大气压）和低温（零下１２０摄氏度左右），使液体成气态，氘向钛的结构中渗透，因此发生核聚变，每秒钟释放出数百个中子。这种试验在４月７日至１０日和４月１５日至１６日的试验测试中效果很好。
    有关专家认为，斯卡拉穆奇小组通过对氘和钛施以高压和低温即可产生中子，这种方法比美国科学家采用的电解方法更简便有效。
    新华社北京４月２０日电　民主德国和巴西科学家进行低温核聚变试验取得成功。
    据德通社报道，德累斯顿工业大学的一个试验小组４月１８日夜间成功地进行了常温下的核聚变试验。他们通过一个钯电极（阴极）和一个铂电极（阳极）把电流输入重水电解液中，中子谱仪测得的结果表明，发生了氘—氘核聚变反应，铂电极上每秒钟释放出０．０２个携带２．４５兆电子伏能量的中子。这个小组在０．０９摄氏度和零下０．０９摄氏度的温度范围内多次重复了这个试验。
    另据外电报道，巴西核能研究所和圣·保罗大学的科学家也于１８日成功地进行了核聚变试验。试验在室温下进行，出现了中子释放现象，反应中所产生的能量是消耗能量的８倍。
    新华社布拉格电　据捷通社报道，捷克斯洛伐克布拉迪斯拉发夸美纽斯大学数学物理系教授帕维尔·波文内茨博士领导的小组于４月１７日实现了室温核聚变反应。他们在实验室条件下用高灵敏度探测设备记录到了用钯作电极电解重水时发生氘核聚变反应放出的高能中子。
    夸美纽斯大学的专家们正在继续探索更有利于释放能量的反应，他们打算用氚代替钯做电极。
    新华社北京４月２１日电　西德和芬兰科学家近日对英美科学家不久前进行的室温核聚变试验提出质疑，并认为实验结果难以证实发生了核聚变。
    西德自由柏林大学马克斯教授和化学设备协会克赖伊萨教授，２０日在一次记者招待会上说，从斯坦利·庞斯和弗莱希曼实验所显示的情况看，现在谈不上已有了可以说明发生了核聚变的“唯一理由”。他们在实验中可能没有对伽玛射线进行测量，而只是测量了实验室墙壁发出的氡，同时也没有进行中子“比较测量”。至于实验中观察到的氚，实验用的重水中已经含有。另据４月２０日的芬兰报纸报道，欧洲核研究中心研究员、原赫尔辛基工业大学校长安蒂·涅米教授认为，上周欧洲核研究中心所做的同样试验表明，有关反应是极普通的现象，试验中释放的能量并非核聚变，而很可能是气态物质的液化。他说，美国犹他大学的低温核聚变试验中缺少关键的中子测量。
    芬兰国家技术研究中心从本月中开始验证美国犹他大学的结果，试验在未取得任何结果后暂时停止。
