Title: Busy Everywhere in Dong Villages

Our visit to the Dong villages coincided with the winter slack season.

When Dong farmers return from the fields to the winding alleys of their villages and enter their wooden houses with golden grain and beams, they still face a busy season.

The village of Jiucun in Kouzhai, Sanbao Township, on the Sanbao Dam in Rongjiang County, Qian Dongnan, is as lively as during a festival. A wedding between a pair of Dong youth has captivated the entire village: cows and pigs are being slaughtered, rice is being washed, and about ten people are bustling in the small kitchen. A group of cheerful old women, dressed in new clothes, are busy decorating the bridal chamber. The tables in the room are already piled high with gifts from neighbors and fellow villagers. A large group of Dong girls, all dressed alike in black Dong round-collar shirts, black shiny rhombus hair buns, red wooden combs, and silver necklaces, make it impossible to distinguish who the bride is. The learned and courteous old man, Yang Guangxing, happily wrote a couplet for me: "Though there is wine for the ceremony, who can complete the feast without rice?" The old man is praising the Dong people's ability to hold such lively weddings, attributing it to having "wine" and "rice"—a prosperous economy.

In the same township and on the same dam, the average annual grain ration was only 180 kilograms, and the average annual net income was just 58 yuan in the past. Since the implementation of the responsibility system, things have changed drastically. Last year, the average annual grain ration was 335 kilograms, and the average annual net income reached 410 yuan. In recent years, Sanbao Dam has become famous for growing watermelons, with this alone contributing nearly 200 yuan to the average annual income.

The sweet days are not something that just happened; the Dong villagers say: the dam area is no longer idle. A couplet on a Dong family's door reads: "Wealth is not desired from Tao Zhu, but children and grandchildren are always hardworking." Hard work is the Dong people's nature. Even during the winter slack season, the industrious Dong farmers are still busy: applying fertilizer for the small spring crops, accumulating fertilizer for spring plowing, laying plastic mulch, applying pesticides, sifting soil for watermelon cultivation, planting and protecting trees, carrying water to combat drought, weaving Dong cloth, making straw mats...

Compared to the winter "idleness" of Sanbao Dam, which exudes a strong atmosphere of modest prosperity, the winter idleness in Maian Village in the mountainous valley of Zaima Township is not on the same level.

It is said that the Dong people "cannot walk without a tray, cannot dress without a sash, cannot eat without sourness, and cannot live without a stream." The first three points are indeed true for Maian Village, but the last one is different from most Dong villages by the water. Maian Village is located in a mountainous valley, far from water, and even the distance to the public road outside the mountain is still twenty to thirty miles. This relatively closed natural environment has kept this Dong village in poverty, making it one of the poorest villages in Rongjiang County. The winter idleness of poverty is even more detached from the busy work for sustenance. The villagers of this village have a peculiar "hobby"—catching birds. There is a kind of bird similar to sparrows on the mountain, flying in flocks. They are the winter delicacy for the Dong people here. Once winter arrives, the villagers go up the mountain to "catch bird ponds," that is, on the mountains where the trees have been cut down, they use bamboo and shrubs to form a large circle and insert "sticky poles" all around. Many families raise "mediator birds," and during the winter bird-catching season, they place the "mediator birds" in the "bird pond" to attract birds with their calls. Thus, the "sticky poles" have prey. The village head, a sturdy and taciturn man, treated us to this heavenly gift of birds. He told us, somewhat gloomily, that catching birds is quite hard work. They leave at four or five in the morning and return at eleven or twelve in the afternoon. On a good day, they can catch seventy or eighty birds, but on a bad day, only one or two. After returning, they have to bathe and feed the "mediator birds." Looking at the string of "mediator birds" hanging in his home, it's truly hard on him.

This village has no advantages. With over 800 people, they guard over 500 acres of paddy fields, growing only one crop of rice, with an average of over 100 kilograms of grain per person, often facing food shortages. Poverty is sometimes tied to conservatism and ignorance. Maian Village also releases its energy into another shortsighted busyness: cutting firewood and making charcoal. The forest is the only advantage of Maian Village. But it is being used in the most primitive and low-value way in the midst of busyness. Once winter arrives, the men go into the mountains to make charcoal. They cut and burn continuously, staying in the mountains for three or four days. Two hundred pounds of wood makes one hundred pounds of charcoal, which they carry out of the mountains and then travel twenty to thirty miles to the township to sell, earning only ten or twenty yuan for one hundred pounds. They cut and burn without stopping, seemingly satisfied with this value. But they seem not to have considered the consequences of cutting down large areas of trees.

At night, whether it is the Dong village of Sanbao Dam with electric lights or the Dong village of Maian with oil lamps, the soft, slow, and melodious Dong songs will inevitably be heard. This song, praised by the world as "unaccompanied polyphonic singing," is a great skill among Dong women.

A comrade accompanying the interview translated the lyrics for me. There are songs praising the village, the drum tower, the new house, the rice fields, and the elders, songs praising herds of cattle and horses and circles of pigs and sheep, songs encouraging goodness, hard work, and criticizing laziness.

The Dong songs, in the midst of entertainment, carry hopes, and in leisure, they do not forget the way of survival. During the winter slack season, singing folk songs, the Dong people are all busy!

　　侗乡处处忙
    本报记者　邹大毅
    我们走访侗乡，适逢冬闲时节。
    当侗族农民从田野回到巷陌肠曲的寨子，走进金穗垂梁的木板房中时，仍然面临着一个忙碌的季节。
    黔东南榕江县三宝大坝上的中宝乡口寨村九村，像过节一样热闹，一对侗族青年男女的婚礼，牵动了全村人：杀牛宰猪，淘米洗菜，十来个人在不大的灶房间忙活着，一群喜气洋洋的老太太，也穿上新衣服，忙着布置新房，房子里的桌子上，已经堆满了邻里乡亲们赠送的彩礼，一大群相同打扮的侗家姑娘，一色的缁里侗族圆领衫、相同的乌黑油亮的菱形髻、红木梳、银项链……使你无法区别出谁是新娘来……知书识礼的杨光兴老汉高兴得在我本子上写下他撰的对联：“虽说有酒成礼义，试问无饭谁方圆。”老汉夸的是侗家人如今能办这样热热闹闹的婚事，仰仗了有“酒”、有“饭”——有了富裕的经济。
    同是这个乡，同是这块大坝子，早年人均口粮只有１８０公斤，人均纯收入才５８元；实行承包责任制以来，就大不一样了。去年人均口粮３３５公斤，人均纯收入达４１０元。三宝大坝这几年种西瓜出了名，仅此一项人均收入就近２００元。
    西瓜一样甜的日子不是等来的，侗族老乡说：坝区已没有农闲了。一户侗家门上的对联写得清楚——“主意不愿陶朱富，常期但望子孙勤”。勤劳是侗族的本色。如今到了冬闲，闲不住的侗族农民仍在忙碌：小春施肥、春耕积肥、跑地膜、农药，筛西瓜的培养土，植树护林，挑水抗旱，织侗布，打草席……
    和三宝大坝那散发着浓郁的小康气氛的冬“闲”比起来，栽麻乡山凹里的苗兰寨子的冬闲，就不是一个档次了。
    人说侗族“走不离盘（旋），穿不离带（子），吃不离酸，住不离溪”，前三条，苗兰寨子的确被言中，唯独这后一条，与大多数依山傍水的侗寨不一样，它在大山上的山凹里，别说离水远，就是距山外的公路，还差二三十里地呢。这种相对封闭的自然环境，使这个侗寨还处于贫困之中，是榕江县的侗寨中数得着的贫困村。贫困的冬闲，更脱离不了为温饱而操劳的忙碌，这个村的村民有一种奇特的“爱好”——牵雀。山上有一种麻雀似的鸟雀，成群结队的。它们是这里侗家冬季的佳肴。一到冬季，寨子里的人就要上山围“雀塘”，即在林木已经伐尽的山上，用竹子、灌木围成一个大圆圈，遍插“粘膏杆”。许多人家中饲养着“媒鸟”，到了冬季捕鸟季节，就把“媒鸟”置于“雀塘”之中，以其鸣声，诱雀入塘。于是，“粘膏杆”上便有了天赐猎物。村长，一个壮壮实实、少言寡语的汉子，招待我们的佳肴，就是这种天赐的雀。他郁郁寡欢地告诉我们，“牵雀”也挺辛苦的，早上四五点钟出门，到中午十一二点才能回来。顺利时，一次可逮七八十只雀，不顺利时，一两只。回来还要给“媒鸟”洗澡、喂饵料。看他家中挂的那一串“媒鸟”，也真够难为他的。
    这个村没有什么优势。８００多口人，守着５００多亩水田，只种一季稻，人均１００多公斤粮，常有青黄不接。贫穷有时和保守、愚昧，是绑在一起的。苗兰寨子，还把自己的能量，释放到又一种短视的忙碌中：伐薪烧炭。树林，是苗兰寨子唯一的优势。但却在忙碌中以最原始、低廉的方式被利用着。一到冬季，男人们就进山烧炭了。连砍带烧，要在山中泡三四天。２００斤木材，烧１００斤炭，从山中背出来，再跑二三十里山路到乡里去卖，１００斤才值十多元。他们连砍不辍，连烧不辍，似乎对这价值十分满意。而对林木大片大片的砍光会有什么后果，则似乎没有想过。
    入夜，不论是点着电灯的三宝大坝的侗寨，还是点着油灯的苗兰寨子，无一例外地要传出那轻唱慢和、珠圆玉润的侗族大歌来。这被世界誉为“无伴奏混声合唱”的侗族歌曲，在侗族的女界是一大特长。
    一位陪同采访的同志把歌词大意翻译给我，其中有赞颂村寨、鼓楼、新屋、稻田、长辈的，有赞牛马成群、猪羊满圈的，劝人为善、劝人勤劳、鞭笞懒惰的。
    侗族大歌，消遣之中寄托了希冀，闲适之中未敢忘生存之道。冬闲季节，连唱民歌，侗族人都是忙碌的！
