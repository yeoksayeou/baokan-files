The People's Daily reports: In Mudanjiang City, where 95.6% of large and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises have adopted the contract responsibility system, the city has conducted a comprehensive review and summary of the contract-operated enterprises. Based on the findings, it has taken measures to improve the contract responsibility system.

According to the Heilongjiang Daily, the city initiated a "look back" activity to understand the status of enterprise reforms and identify factors hindering further reforms. This activity began in December last year and lasted for over three months, addressing issues as they were discovered.

The tendency to use contracts as a substitute for management is a common problem in contract-operated enterprises. The Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government have guided enterprises to integrate reform with management. By identifying management gaps, they have strengthened basic management, strictly enforced economic accounting, and improved various rules and regulations. They have also promoted advanced management measures such as full-load operation methods, thereby enhancing the management level of enterprises. For example, during the inspection, it was found that the Chemical Industry Bureau's system last year incurred various losses and excess expenses (management fees and workshop expenses) amounting to over 11 million yuan due to lax management. Since the beginning of this year, from the bureau's headquarters to enterprises, workshops, teams, and individuals, work objectives, management indicators, and contract indicators have been broken down layer by layer and implemented step by step. Regular economic analysis meetings and economic assessments have been held, significantly improving the management level of enterprises. In the first quarter of this year, despite financial constraints, rising raw material prices, and energy shortages, the bureau achieved a 24% increase in profits and taxes compared to the same period last year.

Mudanjiang City is one of the first cities in the country to implement economic system reforms and has been practicing enterprise contract operations for some time. In recent years, the situation of production factors and product markets has changed significantly, and the original contract base numbers of many enterprises have become imbalanced. The Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government, following the principle of "major stability and minor adjustments," have carefully made appropriate adjustments. The Mudanjiang Rubber Additives Factory, established from the previously loss-making Agricultural Chemicals Factory, implemented contract operations at the beginning of last year. However, the increase in product sales was underestimated, and the "zero-point plan" of "no compensation for losses and no profit retention" was still followed. Last year, the actual profit was over 170 million yuan. After full consultation between the contracting and contracted parties, the contract base was adjusted to remit 30 million yuan in profits annually starting this year, with the remainder retained by the enterprise for expansion and improvement of staff welfare.

During the inspection, it was found that some enterprises that did not originally introduce competitive mechanisms in contract operations lacked a sense of risk among operators. For enterprises with poor operational results, they introduced competitive mechanisms and adopted public bidding methods to select new contract operators. The Fruit Products Company has been operating at a loss for many years. After implementing a "one-on-one" negotiation contract operation last year, the operator did not put in much effort, resulting in a loss of over 40 million yuan by the end of the year. In February this year, the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative decided to implement a public bidding contract for the company. The new manager, upon taking office, implemented a system of layer-by-layer appointment of cadres within the enterprise and optimized the combination of workers. The enterprise's appearance quickly changed.

　　如何完善企业承包经营责任制？
　　牡丹江市总结经验边查边改
　　克服以包代管倾向，调整部分企业承包基数，重新引进竞争机制
    本报讯　大中型工商企业承包面已达９５．６％的牡丹江市，在对承包经营企业全面检查总结的基础上，分别情况采取措施，完善承包经营责任制。
    据黑龙江日报报道，这个市旨在弄清企业改革状况，找出影响改革深化因素的“回头看”活动，从去年１２月开始，持续３个多月，对所发现问题边查边改。
    以包代管是企业承包后的“常见病”。牡丹江市委、市政府指导企业广泛发动群众把改革与管理有机结合起来。在查摆企业管理漏洞的基础上，普遍加强基础管理工作，严格经济核算，健全、完善各项规章制度，推行满负荷工作法等先进管理措施，从而提高企业管理水平。例如检查中发现，市化工局系统去年因放松管理，全局各种消耗损失和两费（企业管理费、车间经费）超支１１００多万元。今年初开始，从局机关到企业、车间、班组和个人，把工作目标，管理指标和承包指标层层分解，逐项逐级落实，并定期召开经济分析会和经济考核，使企业管理水平明显提高。今年第一季度在资金紧缺、原材料涨价和能源不足的情况下，全局实现利税比上年同期增长２４％。
    牡丹江市是国家首批实行经济体制改革试点城市之一，企业承包经营较早。近几年生产要素和产品市场形势变化很大，不少企业原定承包基数出现畸轻畸重。市委、市政府本着“大稳定小调整”的原则，逐一审慎地做了适当调整。牡市橡胶助剂厂是前年底从多年亏损的市农药厂分出来的新建企业。去年初实行承包经营时对产品增销因素估计不足，仍按原亏损企业、“亏损不补，盈利不缴”的“零点方案”实行承包，去年实际盈利１７０多万元。经发包、承包双方充分协商，将承包基数调整为从今年起每年上缴利润３０万元，其余留给企业用于扩大再生产和改善职工福利。
    检查中发现，一些原来未引进竞争机制承包经营的企业，经营者普遍缺乏风险意识。他们对经营成果明显不佳的企业，逐一引进竞争机制，采取公开招标办法重新选择承包经营者。市果品公司过去多年亏损。去年实行“一对一”谈判承包经营后，经营者出力不大，到年底又亏损４０多万元。今年２月，市供销社决定对该公司实行公开招标承包。新任经理上任后，在企业内部实行干部层层聘任制与工人优化组合。企业面貌很快发生变化。
