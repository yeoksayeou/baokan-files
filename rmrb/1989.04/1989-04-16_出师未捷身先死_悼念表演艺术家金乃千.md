The Campaign Unfinished, He Passes Away First
— In Memory of Actor Jin Naqian

On March 25th, the weather in Singapore was so humid that it was hard to breathe. The "Jidiping" ship, returning from the South Pole, was anchored near the harbor. After breakfast, Jin Naqian and the members of the Southeast Antarctic Expedition boarded a small boat to go ashore. He suddenly felt chest pain and was sent to the hospital for treatment. After more than an hour, his heart stopped beating. The renowned actor (who first played Mao Zedong in the stage play "Yang Kaihui"), deputy director of the Drama Art Research Institute of the Central Academy of Drama, Jin Naqian, died of a sudden heart attack at the age of 54 in a foreign land.

The news of Jin Naqian's passing stirred memories in every member of the expedition team. The crew of the TV series "The Great Wall Extends Southward" recalled that when they invited Jin Naqian to play a major role and join them in the South Pole for on-site filming, he said, "A person's life cannot be content with a plain and peaceful life. I am fortunate and honored to be one of the first Chinese actors to venture to the South Pole." During his days and nights in the South Pole, he did not miss any opportunity to experience life. On January 15, 1989, the "Jidiping" encountered a massive ice collapse. The expedition leaders decided to evacuate part of the team to the Zhongshan Station site to ensure the safety of some team members in case the expedition ship met with disaster. Staying on the ship was dangerous, while going ashore was safe. Jin Naqian was fully aware of this. But when he learned that he was on the evacuation list, he was so anxious that he sought out the leaders and begged the director to let him stay on the ship. This allowed him to have a comprehensive understanding and experience of the ice collapse from beginning to end. Later, he wrote a poem: "Snowy seas surge, ice mountains collapse, white demons approach with ferocity, but we laugh as we soar three thousand feet, nothing can stop Zhongshan from welcoming the sunrise."

The TV series "The Great Wall Extends Southward" mainly uses news documentary methods to reflect the hard work and spirit of the Chinese expedition team. Jin Naqian had many difficult scenes to perform. In one scene, he falls into the water. The sea near the Larsemann Hills is often around minus two degrees Celsius. He and other actors decisively jumped into the sea. The icy water soaked their clothes. After finishing the scene, he was so cold that he couldn't speak.

During the filming of the TV series, he was a dedicated actor. During the construction of the station, he was also a responsible cook. He cooked, washed vegetables, and worked hard without complaint.

The news of Jin Naqian's death caused a strong reaction in Singapore, and some art groups published obituaries in the newspapers: "We mourn the loss of a talented actor."

　　出师未捷身先死
　　——悼念表演艺术家金乃千
    新华社记者　张继民
    ３月２５日，新加坡的天气闷热得让人喘不过气来。从南极返航途中的“极地”号停泊在新加坡港附近的锚地。早饭后，金乃千和东南极考察队的队员乘小艇上岸，他突感胸口发闷疼痛，送到医院救治，一个多小时后，心脏停止了跳动。经诊断，这位刚刚５４岁的著名话剧演员（在舞台剧《杨开慧》中首次扮演毛泽东），中央戏剧学院戏剧艺术研究所副所长，由于突发性心肌梗塞，在异国他乡告别人间。
    金乃千的逝世，唤起了每个考察队员的追忆。《长城向南延伸》电视剧组的同志们记得，当他们邀请金乃千出任主要角色，亲赴南极参加实地拍摄时，他说：“人一辈子不能安于平淡恬适的生活，我能成为第一批远征南极的中国演员，这是我的幸运，我的光荣。”在南极的日日夜夜，他没有放过任何一次体验生活的机会。１９８９年１月１５日，“极地”号遇到特大冰崩，考察队领导决定一部分队员疏散到中山站站址上去，以防考察船一旦遇到灭顶之灾，可以确保一部分同志的生命安全。留在船上危险，到了岸上安全，这一点，金乃千是十分清楚的。但当他得知被列入疏散队员名单时，急得团团转，又是找领导申请，又是请导演出面说情，说什么也要留在船上。这使得他对冰崩的前前后后有了全面的了解和体会。事后，他赋诗咏道：“雪海翻腾冰山崩，白色魔鬼来势凶，笑尔扶摇三千尺，难阻中山迎日升。”
    《长城向南延伸》电视剧，主要采用新闻纪实手段反映中国考察队员艰苦奋斗的风采。金乃千在剧中有众多表演场面很难完成。他有一场落水的戏，而拉斯曼丘陵沿海多在零下二摄氏度左右，他和其他演员果断地跳进海中，冰冷的海水浸湿了内衣。拍完戏，他冻得说不出话。
    拍电视剧时，他是个尽职的演员。在建站过程中，他又是个负责的炊事员。做饭，洗菜，任劳任怨。
    金乃千逝世的消息，在新加坡引起强烈反响，一些艺术团体在报上刊登挽词：“痛失剧坛英才”。
