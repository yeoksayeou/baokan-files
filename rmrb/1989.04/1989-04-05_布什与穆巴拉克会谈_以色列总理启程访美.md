U.S. President Bush and Egyptian President Mubarak held talks today at the White House on issues of mutual concern. In a one-hour friendly discussion, the two leaders focused on Middle East peace. Both leaders agreed that in seeking Middle East peace, the two countries share many common goals and emphasized that the U.S. and Egypt each bear significant responsibilities in driving the Middle East peace process forward. President Bush expressed his hope to closely cooperate with President Mubarak to achieve peace, stability, and development in the Middle East.

After the talks, the two presidents delivered speeches in the White House Rose Garden, outlining their basic views on the Middle East issue.

Bush said, "In our discussion, we both recognized the need for direct negotiations to reach a comprehensive solution. Egypt and the United States share common goals: Israel's security, ending the occupation, and achieving Palestinian political rights. These need to be resolved through negotiations. To this end, an 'appropriately structured' international conference may be beneficial at the right time." Bush added, "Now, we need creativity to re-examine old problems and propose imaginative solutions. We must also create a new atmosphere where Israelis and Arabs can both make concessions. As long as both sides understand that dialogue will yield political results, violence can give way to dialogue."

Mubarak said in his speech, "We all have the responsibility to make the greatest effort to expand the opportunities for peace and remove obstacles to a just and comprehensive solution. He noted that some breakthroughs have been made in the past few months, and the current situation is more mature, requiring active efforts. He said, "The U.S. and Egypt have consistent views on many issues. We both believe that a lasting solution should be a comprehensive solution that can address all aspects of the dispute, especially the Palestinian issue. This solution should be achieved through direct negotiations between Israel and all Arab parties within the framework of an international peace conference. The basis for negotiations is the two resolutions of the Security Council, the principle of land for peace, the security of all parties concerned, and the realization of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people."

Israeli Prime Minister Shamir departed for Washington today. Before his departure, Shamir declared that during his visit to the U.S., he would propose a "special plan" to help resolve the Middle East issue. Shamir said he would discuss President Bush's idea of convening a Middle East conference with U.S. officials.

　　布什与穆巴拉克会谈  以色列总理启程访美
    本报华盛顿４月３日电  记者张启昕报道：美国总统布什和埃及总统穆巴拉克今天上午在白宫就共同关心的问题举行会谈。在一个小时的友好会谈中，双方集中讨论了中东和平。两国领导人一致认为，在寻求中东和平方面，两国有许多相同的目标，并指出美埃在推动今后的中东和平进程中各自负有重大责任。布什总统希望与穆巴拉克总统紧密合作，实现中东的和平、稳定与发展。
    会谈后，两国总统在白宫玫瑰园发表了讲话，阐述双方对中东问题的一些基本看法。
    布什说，在会谈中，我们共同认识到需要通过直接谈判达到一项全面解决办法。埃及和美国具有共同的目标：以色列的安全、结束占领，实现巴勒斯坦的政治权利。这些需要坚持谈判解决，为此，一种“结构适当”的国际会议，在适当的时候可能会起到有益作用。布什还说，现在需要一种创造性，重新看待老问题，提出富有想象的解决办法，还必须创造一种以色列人和阿拉伯人彼此都妥协的新气氛，只要双方都了解对话将产生政治效果，暴力能够让位于对话。
    穆巴拉克在讲话中说，我们都有责任尽最大努力扩大和平机会，消除公正、全面解决道路上的障碍。他指出，过去几个月已经取得一些突破，现在的形势比以往更加成熟，要求采取积极的努力。他说，美埃在许多问题上看法是一致的。我们都深信，持久的解决办法应该是全面的解决办法，能够处理争端的各个方面，特别是巴勒斯坦问题。这个解决办法应该在国际和平会议的范围内通过以色列和所有阿拉伯各方的直接谈判取得。谈判的基础是安理会的两个决议、以土地换和平的原则、有关各方的安全以及实现巴勒斯坦人民的合法民族权利。
    据新华社开罗４月４日电　以色列总理沙米尔４日启程前往华盛顿。沙米尔在临行前宣称，他在访美期间将提出有助于和平解决中东问题的“特别方案”。沙米尔说，他将同美国官员讨论布什总统关于召开一次中东和会的构想。
