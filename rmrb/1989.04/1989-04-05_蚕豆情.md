Every time the leaves turn yellow, the north wind blows, and the gentle snowflakes fall, Mother always sends mung beans.

I have a deep affection for mung beans. In my youth, whenever I played until I was hungry, I would push open the door and call out, "I'm hungry!" Mother would smile and pat her chest, pulling out a handful of mung beans from her pocket. I would cup my hands to receive them, pick one with my lips, blink my eyes, and crunch them while looking at Mother, finding them more and more delicious.

Mother is a master at preparing mung beans. She can fry them into red and golden "iron beans," and she can also fry them into "crispy beans" that seem to be smiling. Sometimes, she would cook mung beans for me. She would first soak them in a basin, cover them with a cloth, and place them on the warm side of the kang (traditional heated bed). Every day, I would quietly lift the cover to check them several times. Oh, the mung beans had "grown fatter," sprouted little buds, and the buds grew into small horns. I would then beg Mother to cook them, but she would always say, "Let them grow a bit more." I would then act spoiled, cry, and make a fuss until the mung beans were "boiled and fried." After the mung beans were put into the pot, Mother would add a few pieces of used star anise, a few peppercorns, and a handful of green salt. The steam would rise, and as soon as they were done, I would take the first bowl, crouch by the kang, and eat them like a little cat with a fish.

When I grew up, left home to study, and started working, every time I visited home, Mother would still prepare mung beans in various ways. A few days before I left, Mother would be busier than ever. By the dim light of the kang, sitting on the kang with her legs crossed, she would wear her glasses and pick out the larger mung beans one by one with her thin hands, so patiently and attentively, infusing all her love into the mung beans.

After I got married, I rarely went home, but the "mung bean lovers" club was expanding. Every Spring Festival, the table for entertaining guests would have my wife's signature dishes: fried mung beans, stir-fried mung beans with meat, and spicy beans. From the time the children understood, they also ate iron beans, crispy beans, and cooked mung beans. Every time they put on their winter clothes, they would ask, "When will Grandma send the mung beans?"

I wrote this information in a letter to Mother, and she was overjoyed. Whether it was a good year or a bad year, she sent mung beans every year, as reliably as the frost signaling the arrival of winter.

It is another season of returning to the roots, and I received the first package of mung beans sent from my hometown. As soon as I entered the door, my child ran over with hands raised in a "V" shape, touched the package, and upon hearing it was mung beans, pouted and walked away. My wife took the package, placed it on the table, and smiled, saying, "The mung beans Mother sent last year haven't been touched yet. Let's tell her not to send any more."

A sense of loss welled up in my heart. I slowly picked up the package, weighed it, and it felt heavy. I looked at it; the stitches were fine and dense, each stitch and thread sewn so carefully. I opened it and scooped up a handful; they were as large as dates, as red as iron, each one smooth and even, as if sifted.

My son came over, stuffed a peanut into my mouth with his chubby little hand, and playfully asked, "Dad, are peanuts delicious? Are mung beans delicious?"

My heart trembled. Just like when I was young, I cupped the mung beans in my hands, brought them close to my lips, picked one up, and chewed it slowly. It was a bit sweet and a bit bitter. Gratitude and longing filled my heart, turning into a warm current that surged up my throat. Finally, two tears of joy fell onto the mung beans from my hometown.

　　蚕豆情
　　李清山
    每当树叶黄了，北风起了，飘飘飏飏的瑞雪过后，母亲总寄蚕豆来。
    我对蚕豆有一种悠长的感情。在我绿鬓年少之时，每当玩到半晌，推开家门一喊饿，母亲总眯眯一笑，撩开衣襟，从兜里掏出一把蚕豆，我便掬着双手接过来，用嘴噙起一颗，眨巴着眼，冲着母亲咯嘣咯嘣吃着，越嚼越觉得香甜。
    母亲是做蚕豆的能手。她会把蚕豆炒成红脸花脸的“铁豆豆”，又会把蚕豆炒成裂嘴笑的“酥豆豆”。偶尔还给我煮蚕豆，她先把蚕豆泡在瓦盆里，用苫布盖住，放在热炕头上。每天，我都要悄悄掀开蒙布看上几遍，呀，蚕豆“胖”了，蚕豆拱出尖芽芽了，芽芽长成小犄角了，我便磨着母亲给煮，母亲总是说：“再长长吧。”我便撒娇，抹泪，直闹到蚕豆“赴汤蹈火”。蚕豆下锅后，母亲还要放几瓣用过的大料，抓几粒花椒，撒一把青盐，腾腾的热气冒过，一出锅，我便端过第一碗，趴在炕沿上，像小猫叼住了鱼。
    待我长大了，离家外出上学了，参加工作了，每次探家，母亲还是变着样儿给做这样那样的蚕豆。临行前几天，母亲更是忙到了高潮，小炕青灯，方桌之上，蚕豆堆成小山，母亲戴上花镜，盘腿而坐，用那干瘦的手，拣大颗的蚕豆一粒一粒地挑呀挑呀，那么耐心，那么专注，把一片深情都溶化在了蚕豆之中。
    我结婚后，很少回家了，但“蚕豆爱好者”的队伍却在扩大。每到春节，招待亲朋好友的席面上，总有妻子的拿手戏：油炸蚕豆，肉炒蚕豆，怪味豆儿……，孩子从懂事的时候起，也吃上了铁豆豆、酥豆豆、煮蚕豆。每到穿起棉衣，总要问：“奶奶还不寄蚕豆来？”我把这一信息写信告诉了母亲，她高兴得什么似的，不论丰年歉年，年年寄蚕豆，准确的像过了霜降必然立冬一样。
    又是一个落叶归根的时节，我拿着第一次姗姗来迟的寄自家乡的邮包，一进家门，孩子双手举成丫形跑过来，用手摸摸邮包，一听说是蚕豆，噘着嘴走开了。妻子接过邮包，放在桌子上，微笑着说：“去年妈邮来的蚕豆还没动呢，让老人家以后别寄了。”
    一种怅有所失的感情涌上我的心头，我慢慢拿起邮包，掂掂，沉沉的；看看，细细针，密密线，针针线线缝得都那么仔细；拆开，掬起一捧，大如枣，红如铁，颗颗粒粒，筛过一般匀。
    儿子凑上来，胖胖的小手把一粒花生蘸塞在我的嘴里，调皮地问：“爸爸，花生好吃？蚕豆好吃？”
    我的心一颤，像小时候那样，把掬着蚕豆的双手贴近嘴唇，噙起一颗，慢慢地咀嚼着，有几分甜，有几分涩，恩情、别情一齐涌上心头，化成一股热流，窜上喉咙，终于两滴欣慰的泪，掉在了家乡的蚕豆上……
