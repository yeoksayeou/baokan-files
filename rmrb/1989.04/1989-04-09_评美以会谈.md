	Commentary on the U.S.-Israel Talks
	By Zhang Qixun, Our Correspondent

	Israeli Prime Minister Shamir recently held talks in Washington with American leaders following the Bush administration's recent proposal for a new Middle East peace initiative. Regarding Shamir's "election plan" proposed a few days earlier to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict—whereby Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip would hold elections to select representatives to negotiate with Israel for limited self-rule—America is not satisfied. However, to prevent the high-level U.S.-Israel talks from reaching an impasse, the U.S. took a "cautious supportive" stance on Shamir's plan, while also making it clear to Israel that the U.S. does not unconditionally agree to the plan. According to U.S. officials, the U.S. intends to adopt Israel's plan and then improve and develop it. Through negotiations, both sides reached a compromise: the U.S. agreed to elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip; Israel, in turn, assured the U.S. that the temporary arrangements for Palestinian self-rule are not the final goal but rather a part of a broader political process. Israel bears the responsibility to negotiate and reach an agreement on the final status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The U.S. also demanded that Israel reach an election plan acceptable to both sides with the Palestinians.

	However, the differences between the U.S. and Israel are evident. The U.S. advocates ending Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and does not support Israel's claim to sovereignty or permanent occupation of these areas. In contrast, Israel's position is to not relinquish the West Bank and to reject the "land for peace" principle. Shamir even stated that if Israel withdraws from the West Bank, war is almost certain to occur. The second point of contention is that Israel's "election plan" is conditional, requiring Palestinians to first cease their resistance, while the U.S. opposes linking these two issues. Even if elections are to be held, they will face numerous difficulties. U.S. newspapers suggest that the U.S. government may need to spend a lot of time negotiating with Israel and may not find a suitable election method.

	The core of the Middle East problem is the Palestinian issue, which involves ending Israel's occupation through negotiations and realizing the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people. In the new situation, the U.S.'s policy adjustments and search for new approaches are welcome. However, the U.S.-Israel talks indicate that while Israel, to avoid isolation, has made some superficial concessions, it still ignores reality and maintains a rigid stance. If the U.S. wants to achieve something in the Middle East issue, it seems that it cannot be satisfied with Israel's verbal assurances during the talks but must push Israel more to change its attitude. Only then can the Middle East peace process move forward.

　　评美以会谈
    本报记者  张启昕
    以色列总理沙米尔最近在华盛顿同美国领导人的会谈是在布什政府近期提出中东和平新设想后举行的。对于沙米尔几天前提出的解决阿以冲突的“选举方案”，即由西岸和加沙地带的巴勒斯坦人举行选举，选出代表与以色列进行谈判，实行有限的自治，美国是不满足的。但为了使这次美以高级会谈不致陷入僵局，美国对沙米尔的方案采取了“谨慎支持”的态度，同时向以色列表明，美国不是无条件同意这个方案的。据美国官方人士称，美国打算接过以色列的方案，然后加以改进与发展。双方通过会谈作出了妥协，美国同意在西岸和加沙地带进行选举；以色列则向美国保证，有关巴勒斯坦自治的临时安排不是最终目标，而是更广泛的政治进程的一环，以色列负有责任谈判达成一项有关西岸和加沙地带最后地位的协议，同时美国还要求以色列同巴勒斯坦人达成一项彼此都能接受的选举方案。
    然而，美以之间的分歧是明显的。美国主张结束以色列对西岸和加沙地带的占领，不支持以色列对这些地区拥有主权或者永久占领；而以色列的立场却是不放弃西岸，不同意以“土地换和平”，沙米尔甚至说，以色列离开西岸，几乎肯定发生战争。分歧之二是，以色列提出“选举方案”是附加有条件的，即它要巴勒斯坦人先停止反抗斗争，而美国则不同意把两者联系起来。在这种情况下，即使要搞选举，也是困难重重。美国报纸认为，美国政府可能得花很多时间去同以色列讨论，也不一定就能找到合适的选举办法。
    中东问题的核心是巴勒斯坦问题，即通过谈判，结束以色列占领，实现巴勒斯坦人民的合法民族权利。在新的形势下，美国在调整政策的过程中，寻找新的途径是受到欢迎的。然而美以会谈表明，虽然以色列为了避免孤立，表面上作出了一些让步，但它无视现实，坚持僵硬的立场仍没有变。美国如果要在中东问题有所作为，看来不能满足于以色列在会谈中口头上所作的保证，而要更多地促使以色列改变态度，中东的和平进程才能向前推进。
