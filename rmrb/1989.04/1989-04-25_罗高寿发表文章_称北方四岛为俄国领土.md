	Claims Northern Territories as Soviet Land

	New China News Agency, Moscow, April 24 — Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Rogachev today accused Japan of having territorial ambitions against the Soviet Union and linked the prospect of significant progress in Soviet-Japanese relations to the resolution of the Northern Territories issue.

	This accusation was made in a lengthy article titled "Unfounded Demands" published in this evening's edition of *Izvestia*.

	Rogachev cited the Yalta Agreement and the San Francisco Treaty, refuting Japan's stance on the Northern Four Islands point by point, emphasizing that these islands have "belonged to Russia since ancient times." He also accused Japan of attempting to seek support from third countries on the Northern Territories issue. He said that any attempt to alter the results of World War II would have dangerous consequences for the international situation.

    称北方四岛为俄国领土
    新华社莫斯科４月２４日电  苏联副外长罗高寿今天指责日本对苏联有领土野心，并把苏日关系能否取得重大进展同解决北方领土问题联系起来。
    这一指责是他今晚在《消息报》上发表的题为《没有根据的要求》的长文中提出的。
    罗高寿引用雅尔塔协定和旧金山和约，逐条驳斥日方对北方４岛所持立场，强调这些岛屿“自古以来”就是俄国的领土。他还指责日本企图呼吁第三国在北方领土问题上给予支持。他说，任何妄图修改二次大战结果的做法，都会给国际形势造成危险的后果。
