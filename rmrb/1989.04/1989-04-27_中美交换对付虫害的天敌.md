According to a signed article from the United States Information Agency, American scientists have come to China to search for natural enemies to combat American pests. This is part of a broad initiative between China and the U.S. to find "good insects."

The article states that the U.S. has a history of over a hundred years in using natural enemies to control pests. On November 30, 1888, the U.S. Department of Agriculture imported 129 ladybugs from Australia and released them in California to combat citrus pests. This marked the beginning of the U.S. importing "good insects" from abroad. Since then, the U.S. has imported "good insects" from China, Japan, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, South Korea, and Vietnam on multiple occasions. However, after the invention of DDT in 1939, natural enemies were replaced by chemical pesticides. Due to the environmental pollution caused by chemical agents, the U.S. has recently focused on using natural enemies to combat various pests.

Last year, China and the U.S. signed an agreement to jointly establish a Sino-American Biological Control Laboratory in Beijing. The two countries have already exchanged several natural enemies. The U.S. has provided China with natural enemies to combat water hyacinths. The U.S. will search for natural enemies in China to combat a broad-leaved euphorbia plant in the American West and to clear water hyacinths that are densely growing in the southeastern and eastern coastal regions of the U.S. These water hyacinths severely block some of the U.S.'s waterways.

The article states that the U.S. Department of Agriculture will investigate the situation of aphids in western China. A pest known as the Russian wheat aphid was first discovered in Texas in 1986 and quickly spread throughout the western U.S., causing severe damage. The losses in 1988 alone exceeded one billion dollars. This pest only exists in western China and has not caused problems there, possibly due to the presence of a natural enemy of aphids. A Chinese expert will assist in understanding this situation.

In December of this year, scientists from mainland China and Taiwan will join American scientists in San Antonio, Texas, for a symposium titled "The Field of Biological Control in China." This will be the first time scientists from mainland China and Taiwan participate in the same symposium.

### 中美交换对付虫害的天敌

　　中美交换对付虫害的天敌
    本报讯  据美国新闻总署的一篇署名文章介绍，美国科学家将来中国寻找对付美国虫害的天敌。这是中美两国一项广泛寻觅“好虫子”活动的一部分。
    文章说，美国使用天敌控制虫害已有百余年历史。一八八八年十一月三十日美国农业部从澳大利亚引进了一百二十九个瓢虫，撒在美国的加利福尼亚州以对付柑桔虫害。这是美国从国外进口“好虫子”的开始。此后，美国曾从中国、日本、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、南朝鲜和越南多次引进“好虫子”。但一九三九年发明ＤＤＴ以后，天敌被化学杀虫剂取代。由于化学药剂造成环境污染，美国近年来又致力于使用天敌对付各种虫灾。
    去年，中美两国签署了一项协议，在北京共建一所中美生物控制实验室。两国间已交换不少天敌。美国向中国提供了对付水草的天敌。美国将在中国寻找对付美国西部一种阔叶大戟属植物的天敌和清除丛生于美国东南部和东部沿岸的水草的天敌。这些水草严重堵塞美国的一些水路。
    文章说，美国农业部将了解中国西部地区麦蚜虫的情况。一种名为俄罗斯麦蚜虫的害虫一九八六年首次在美国得克萨斯州发现并迅速广泛地在美国西部地区蔓延，造成严重损失，去年的损失达一亿美元以上。而这种害虫只存在于中国西部地区，并未造成问题，可能是由于那里有一种蚜虫的天敌。一位中国专家将协助了解这一情况。
    今年十二月，中国大陆和台湾的科学家将和美国科学家一起在得克萨斯州的圣安东尼奥举行题为“中国生物控制的领域”的专题讨论会。这将是来自中国大陆和台湾的科学家首次参加同一个专题讨论会。
