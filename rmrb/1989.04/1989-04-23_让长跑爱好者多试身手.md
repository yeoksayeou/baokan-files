This year's China-Japan Friendship Great Wall Marathon Relay Race has seen increased competition due to the participation of many Chinese athletes, adding a competitive edge to this event symbolizing the friendly exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan.

Japan has a wealth of marathon talent and has always enjoyed a high reputation on the international stage. However, in the past two years of the China-Japan Friendship Great Wall Marathon Relay Race, they have not held the advantage. Upon closer examination, it is not that our long-distance running standards have suddenly improved, nor that Japan's top athletes have suddenly declined. Rather, the Japanese athletes participating in this event each year are mainly company employees and students from various levels of schools who are marathon enthusiasts. They use the competition to communicate with Chinese athletes and foster friendship.

However, we seem to place too much emphasis on the competitive nature of this friendly event. This time, the strong marathon team from Yunnan traveled thousands of miles to participate, and even the champion of this year's Nagoya International Women's Marathon, Zhao Youfeng, returned from Japan to assist. Although they easily won, what is the real significance of such a victory? In the face of the growing call for the socialization of sports, we have not provided more opportunities for sports enthusiasts to compete. The Beijing Spring Festival City Run, a mass long-distance running event that has been held for 25 consecutive years, has been shrinking due to insufficient funds and has been changed to the Spring Long-Distance Run this year, with a significant reduction in the number of participants and a diminished atmosphere.

For competitions like the China-Japan Friendship Great Wall Marathon Relay Race, which are not highly competitive, if we expand the selection of participants to include talents from the grassroots level, it can not only motivate marathon enthusiasts to maintain their long-term training enthusiasm but also discover and select outstanding marathon talents among them. Is it worth a try?

　　让长跑爱好者多试身手
    李北大
    今年中日友好长城马拉松接力赛，由于我国众多名将出场，这项象征中日两国人民友好往来的赛事陡增竞争气氛。
    日本马拉松运动人才济济，在国际赛场上从来享有很高声誉，但在近两年的中日友好长城马拉松接力赛中，他们未占优势。细察之下，并非咱们的长跑水平突然提高，也不是日本的好手水平突然下降，而是日本每年来华参加这项赛事的选手主要由公司职员以及大、中学校学生等各方面的长跑爱好者组成。他们是通过比赛来与中国选手沟通感情、增进友谊的。
    然而，我们似乎过于看重了这项友好赛事的竞技性。这次马拉松劲旅云南队千里迢迢赶来参赛，连今年名古屋国际女子马拉松赛冠军赵友凤也从东瀛回国助战。尽管他们轻松夺魁，但这样的取胜又有多少实际意义？在体育社会化呼声日益高涨的形势下，我们并没有给体育爱好者提供更多的比赛机会。已连续举办了２５届的群众性长跑活动——北京春节环城赛，因为经费不足越办越萎缩，今年已改为春季长跑赛，参赛人数随之骤减，声势更是不如从前。
    诸如中日友好长城马拉松接力赛这样竞争性不强的比赛，如果扩大选拔参赛选手范围，从民间基层挑选人才，既可调动长跑爱好者坚持长年锻炼的热情，又能在他们中间发现和选拔优秀的长跑人才，可否一试呢？
