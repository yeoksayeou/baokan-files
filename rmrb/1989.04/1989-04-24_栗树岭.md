Title: Chestnut Ridge

The early spring breeze in the Dabie Mountains is somewhat damp.

The village of Chestnut awakens early. When the green tiles and purple mountain mist still shroud the green bricks, the smoke from the cooking fires is already rising.

The county committee secretary had previously told me that this village is famous for its chestnuts and is quite prosperous. That day, I got up early and strolled towards the Chestnut Ridge at the village entrance.

The entire ridge is covered with chestnut trees, which have already sprouted tender green leaves. What surprised me was that each chestnut tree had a red paper strip tied around its trunk, blending harmoniously with the spring couplets and New Year paintings at the foot of the mountain. Oh, the joy of the Spring Festival is still here.

At the edge of the forest, a wooden signboard hangs from a branch of a chestnut tree, proudly displaying the words "Responsibility Forest" and "Contractor: Gan Shanfu" in large characters.

Not far from here, an old man with a sturdy build is squatting on a large flat stone. I approach him and strike up a conversation:

"Are you Uncle Shanfu?"

The old man nods. He hears that I am returning from the provincial capital and asks, "It's been many years since you last visited your hometown, hasn't it?"

"About fifteen or sixteen years."

"You should come back and take a look..."

The two young women who were busy pruning ahead of us also joined in the conversation.

They are both very delicate. The older one wears a red headscarf and traditional local attire; the younger one wears jeans and a fashionable pink down jacket.

The old man smiles and says, "These are my two daughters. The younger one is studying at the provincial agricultural college on her own."

This made our conversation even more engaging.

The old man said, "If you had come to Chestnut Ridge 15 years ago, I would have been crying here..."

His face suddenly became stern.

It turned out that during the "cutting off the tail" movement, this once lush green mountain ridge was shaved bald. The old man was labeled as having "white thoughts" because he planted dozens of chestnut trees in front of his house. He was punished by having to paste white paper strips on each chestnut tree, along with his two daughters, who were then in primary school...

"Enough, let's not talk about it," the old man said, as if afraid I would feel bad. His face regained its rosy glow: "Since the spring breeze blew into Chestnut Ridge, I have planted this grove of chestnut trees. Now, the annual net income is over 2,000 yuan!"

Yes, relying on the mountain to eat from the mountain, the days will be better when the mountain is green. Only with green hope can there be a fiery life.

The morning sun rises, and the mountain is a mix of red and green, full of vitality.

At this moment, the old man's younger daughter whispered something in my ear, making her sister hit her twice in frustration.

The old man laughed heartily, "Dani is fine. Our family is rich, and she wants to do some 'mentoring'."

The elder sister is kind-hearted. She said that if one family is rich, it will shine; if the whole village is rich, it will shine brightly. She opened a night school for chestnut cultivation in the village, and young men and women eagerly participated. Several notorious "hotheads" in the village obediently followed her instructions.

The younger sister pouted, "Our sister is very strict in choosing a partner, she has her own 'era standards.'"

The old man's elder daughter is famous in the county for her standards in choosing a partner. The county radio station broadcasted her marriage announcement, seeking a young man who is proficient in fruit tree cultivation and has scientific knowledge. This became a famous story. Because she is beautiful, she is one of the most famous girls in the hundred-li mountain area, and many young men want to try their luck.

There was a son of a brigade cadre who combed his hair shiny and polished his shoes to a shine, also came to propose. He was rejected by the girl and couldn't even enter the door.

There was also a relative of a township head who asked someone to intercede. The young man brought thick gifts on his bicycle. The girl pushed him away, saying she was going to the city to buy agricultural chemicals, and didn't even let him see her face...

I listened with great interest, my spirits lifted, and asked Uncle Shanfu, "What about now?"

Just then, a "Dongfanghong" brand tractor was driving up the winding mountain road at the foot of the mountain, and the driver was quite spirited.

Uncle Shanfu's wrinkles immediately smoothed out, and he laughed, "Look, who's here? Today you're in luck, no matter what, this cup of wedding wine must be drunk in advance!"

The sisters smiled knowingly.

Indeed, how could this cup of strong wedding wine not be drunk?!

　　栗树岭
    潘万提
    大别山早春的风，有些湿润。
    栗树村醒得早。当青砖绿瓦还迷蒙在紫色的山雾之中，炊烟已袅袅升腾了。
    县委书记早对我介绍，此村盛产板栗，挺富裕的。那天我便起个大早，信步向村头的栗树岭走去。
    满岭的栗树，已经吐露嫩绿。使我惊讶的是，每棵栗树的腰身都贴着一圈红纸条，与山脚下家家户户的春联门画相映成趣。哦，这里还留着春节的喜气哩。
    在林边一棵栗树的腰枝挂着表示“责任林”的木牌，赫然写着“承包人：耿山富”六个大字。  　离此不远的一块大青石上，蹲着个十分壮实的老汉。我上前搭讪：
    “你是山富大叔吧？”
    老汉点点头。他听说我是从省城回来的，因问：“好多年没回家乡了吧？”
    “十五六年了。”
    “该回来看看了啊……”
    在前面忙着整枝的两个姑娘，听到我们交谈，也凑了过来。
    她俩长得都很娟秀，大一点的，围着红纱巾，一身本地装束；小一点的是牛仔裤和时下流行的粉红羽绒服。
    老汉笑眯眯地说，这是他的两个姑娘，小姑娘正自费在省农学院进修。
    这一来，我们的话更投机了。
    老汉说：“你如果１５年前来栗树岭，我正在这里流泪咧……”
    他的脸色陡然严峻起来。
    原来，在那场“割尾巴”运动中，这片本来苍翠碧绿的山岭，被剃成了“和尚头”。老汉因为在房前屋后栽种了几十棵栗树，被宣判为“思想白色”，罚他领着当时才念小学的两个姑娘，给每棵栗树贴上白纸条……
    “好了，不提它了，”老汉像怕我难过似的，脸庞重又泛起红光：“打从春风吹进栗树岭，我又栽了这片栗树。现在，每年纯收入可达两千多块哩！”
    是呀，靠山吃山，山绿了，日子才好过。有了绿色的希望，才有火红的生活。
    早霞飞升，山中红绿相间，一派勃勃生机。
    这时候，老汉的小姑娘和我耳语几句，急得姐姐捶了她两拳。
    老汉乐呵呵地说：“大妮还行。俺家富了，她还要搞个‘传帮带’。”
    姐姐心眼好。她说一家富，亮一点，全村富，亮一片。她在村里开办了个栗树种植夜校传授班，姑娘小伙子们踊跃参加，几个全村出名的“愣头青”，都乖乖地听她指挥。
    妹妹撅着嘴巴：“俺姐选对象也很严格，有自己的一套‘时代标准。’”
    老汉的大姑娘挑选对象，在全县是出了名的。县广播站播发了她的征婚启事，要的是精通果树栽培技术，有科学知识的小伙，一时传为佳话。因她长得标致，在百里山乡是数得着的姑娘，不少小伙子都想碰碰运气。
    有个大队干部的儿子，头梳得油光可鉴，皮鞋擦得锃亮，也来求亲。被姑娘拒之门外，连门都进不得。
    还有一个乡长的亲戚，托人说了情，小伙子自行车驮来厚礼。姑娘推说进城采购农药，面也没让见……
    我饶有兴趣地听着，精神为之一振，便问山富大叔：“现在呢？”
    山脚下的盘山公路上，正好开来一辆“东方红”牌拖拉机，开车的小伙蛮精神。
    山富大叔的皱纹顿时舒展开了，笑着说：“这不，说谁谁到。就是他——乡农科站的果树技术员。”
    小伙子停下车，朝岭上走来。
    大叔异常高兴，拉着我的手说：“今天你赶上了，说啥这杯喜酒也得提前喝！”
    姐妹俩会心地笑了。
    可也是，这杯浓酽的喜酒，能不喝吗？！
