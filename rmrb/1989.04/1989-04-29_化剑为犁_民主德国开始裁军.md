Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 28th.

On the morning of April 28, at the base of the 8th Tank Regiment of the National People's Army in Goldberg, Schwerin District, northern East Germany, the entire regiment stood in neat rows, marching to the solemn military music as the commanding officers inspected the troops. Among the ranks being inspected were 127 young men in civilian clothes. They took off their uniforms today and are about to leave the military. Today's grand ceremony was held to see them off.

Sending soldiers home is a routine matter, but today's ceremony carried a special significance. The vacancies left by the demobilized soldiers will not be filled, and the 8th Tank Regiment will reduce one of its battalions. This means that the unilateral demobilization of 10,000 troops announced by East German leader Honecker in January has officially begun. This move by East Germany has been welcomed by world opinion. Today, more than 100 foreign journalists rushed to the scene to witness the ceremony. Their cameras clicked non-stop.

At 10:30 AM, the farewell ceremony began. After the commander of the Neubrandenburg Military District, Major General Silla, inspected the troops, the national anthem of East Germany was played. Then, a group of children presented each demobilized soldier with a bouquet of fresh flowers. Colonel Hempel, the representative from the Ministry of Defense, told reporters that by October of this year, the 8th Tank Regiment will be disbanded. In addition, the 1st, 4th, 11th, 16th, and 23rd Tank Regiments stationed in Beelitz, Gotha, Sandershausen, Grossenhain, and Stahleberg will also take similar measures. Furthermore, by the end of 1989, one flight squadron will be disbanded, and 50 combat aircraft will be decommissioned.

As the young men prepared to return home with their luggage, 31 grass-green T-72 tanks originally belonging to the 8th Tank Regiment had already been loaded onto trains, ready to be transported to eastern East Germany. The reporters also aimed their cameras at these tanks. These tanks will be converted into civilian equipment to serve the national economy. This is the first batch of the 600 tanks that East Germany plans to reduce. This practice of turning swords into plowshares reflects East Germany's sincere desire for peace. Everyone hopes that one day, all the "swords" in the world will be turned into "plowshares." To achieve this goal, the United States and the Soviet Union, which possess the most "swords," should be the first to put down their "swords" and turn them into "plowshares."

### 化剑为犁——民主德国开始裁军

　　化剑为犁   
    ——民主德国开始裁军
    本报记者  许宏治
    ４月２８日上午，在民主德国北方什未林专区戈尔德贝格的国家人民军坦克８团驻地，全团官兵排列着整齐的队伍，在庄严的军乐声中接受部队首长的检阅。在接受检阅的行列中，有１２７名穿着便装的小伙子。他们从今天起脱下了军装，即将离开部队。今天这个隆重的仪式就是为了欢送他们。
    欢送士兵退伍本是常事，但今天这个仪式又有着不同寻常的意义。退伍士兵留下的空额将不再补充，坦克８团的建制将减少一个营。这意味着，民主德国领导人昂纳克今年１月份宣布的单方面裁军一万的措施正式开始实行。民德的这一措施受到世界舆论的欢迎。今天，有１００多名外国记者赶来观看仪式。他们手中的相机“咔嚓”“咔嚓”地响个不停。
    上午１０时半，欢送仪式开始，新勃兰登堡军区司令西拉中将检阅部队以后，奏起了民主德国国歌。接着，一批少年儿童向退伍士兵们每人献上一束鲜花。国防部派来的代表赫姆佩尔中校告诉记者，到今年１０月，坦克８团将解散。此外，驻在贝利茨、哥达、桑德斯豪森、格罗森海因和斯塔尔贝格等地的第１、４、１１、１６、２３坦克团也将采取同样措施。另外，在１９８９年年底前，还将解散一个飞行大队，使５０架作战飞机退役。
    在退伍的小伙子们背起行装准备回家的同时，原属坦克８团的３１辆草绿色的Ｔ─ＳＳ型坦克已经装上火车，准备运往民德东部。记者们又把相机对准了这些坦克。这些坦克将被改装成民用设备，为国民经济效力。这是民德打算裁减的６００辆坦克中的第一批。这种化剑为犁的做法，反映了民主德国真诚的和平愿望。人们都希望有那么一天，全世界的“剑”都能化作“犁”。为了达到这个目的，拥有最多“剑”的美苏两国，应该首先更多地放下手中的“剑”，把它们化作“犁”。
