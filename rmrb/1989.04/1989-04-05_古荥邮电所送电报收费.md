The Ancient Postal Service in Zhengzhou charges for delivering telegrams. Recently, the postal workers from the Ancient Postal Service in Zhengzhou's Ancient District have been charging recipients of telegrams a delivery fee, and this fee has been increasing. Before June of last year, this postal service charged 0.6 yuan per telegram delivered to the military. After the Spring Festival this year, the delivery fee per telegram has risen to 3 yuan. Due to the high delivery fee, some soldiers in our camp have refused to accept telegrams. Some postal workers do not issue receipts after collecting the fee.

　　古荥邮电所送电报收费
    近来，郑州市古荥邮电所邮递员送电报时，向收电报人收费，且“送费”一涨再涨。去年６月以前，这家邮电所送往部队的电报，每份加收０．６元“送费”。今年春节以后，每份电报的“送费”已涨到３元。由于“送费”太高，我营一些战士拒收电报。有的邮递员收费后，不开收据。
