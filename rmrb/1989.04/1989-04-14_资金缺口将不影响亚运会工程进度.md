The 11th Asian Games construction command center has informed reporters that, as of April 10, the construction of sports venues for the Asian Games has completed 60% of the work, while the supporting municipal engineering projects have completed 80% of the work. The head of the command center stated: "The funding gap will not affect the progress of the construction of the Asian Games venues."

Deputy Commander Gu Yàojú and Deputy Chief Architect Zhōu Zhìliáng of the Asian Games construction command center are optimistic about the completion of the Asian Games venues by the end of September this year. They believe that the situation this year is better than last year. Due to support from all sides, there are no issues with building materials; although the Asian Games construction has a significant amount of outstanding payments, it will not affect the progress of the venue construction.

The Asian Games sports venues construction includes the new construction of 16 venues, the renovation and reconstruction of 11 existing venues. Among them, the new projects include eight medium-sized gymnasiums: Beijing University, Beijing Institute of Physical Education, Shijingshan, Yuetan, Haidian, Ditan, Chaoyang, and Muxiyuan, as well as three specialized projects: Changping Cycling Track, Fengtai Baseball Field, and Pinggu Sea Child Water Sports Venue, which have basically been completed. The renovation of the main venue for the Asian Games, Beijing Workers' Stadium, and Beijing Xiannongtan Stadium has also been completed.

Zhōu Zhìliáng said that the Beijing Workers' Stadium was built in 1959. This renovation project is equivalent to building a new stadium, with the original plan investing 18 million yuan, but the actual investment exceeded 50 million yuan. The Beijing Xiannongtan Stadium was completely demolished and rebuilt.

More than 30,000 workers from 28 construction units in Beijing, Hebei, and Hubei participated in the construction of the Beijing Asian Games. Currently, 30,000 builders are concentrated in the sports center in the northern suburbs, working day and night. The construction of four large competition venues there is progressing rapidly, with the main structure of the hockey field and track and field stadium already completed. The swimming pool and gymnasium are expected to complete the structural roof by the end of this month.

Zhōu Zhìliáng introduced that the swimming pool here is first-class in Asia, with high construction difficulty and a total investment of over 100 million yuan.

　　资金缺口将不影响亚运会工程进度
    新华社北京４月１２日电　（记者李莉、李贺普）记者从第十一届亚运会工程指挥部获悉，截至本月１０日的统计，亚运会体育场馆工程已经完成了６０％的工作量，与之相配套的市政工程已经完成了８０％的工作量。指挥部负责人说：“资金缺口将不影响亚运会场馆工程建设的进度。”
    亚运会工程指挥部副总指挥顾钥菊和副总建筑师周治良，对今年９月底以前基本完成亚运会场馆工程持乐观态度。他们认为，今年的情况好于去年，由于各方面的支持，建筑材料没有问题；亚运会工程欠帐不少，但不会影响场馆工程的建设进度。
    亚运会体育场馆工程包括新建１６个场馆、改建和修建原有的１１个场馆。其中新建项目北京大学生、北京体院、石景山、月坛、海淀、地坛、朝阳和木樨园８个中小体育馆，以及昌平自行车场、丰台棒球场和平谷海子水上运动场３个专项工程已基本完工，亚运会主会场北京工人体育场和北京先农坛体育场的改建工程也已经完工。
    周治良说，北京工人体育场是１９５９年建设的。这次改建工程量等于新建一个体育场，原计划投资１８００万人民币，实际投资超过了５０００万。北京先农坛体育场是全部拆除后重建的。
    北京、河北、湖北等２８个建筑单位的几万名工人参加了北京亚运会工程建设。现在有３万名建设者集中在北郊的体育中心，日夜奋战。那里的４个大型比赛场馆工程建设进度很快，其中曲棍球场和田径场已经完成主体结构工程，游泳馆和体育馆可望本月底完成结构封顶。
    周治良介绍说，这里的游泳馆是亚洲第一流的，施工难度大，总投资在１亿元以上。
