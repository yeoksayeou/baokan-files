U.S. Supports Free Elections in Israeli-Occupied Areas; Shamir Refuses to Negotiate with the PLO

    Our reporter Zhang Qixun reports from Washington, D.C., April 6: U.S. President George H.W. Bush today held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on the Middle East issue. Bush emphasized after the talks that the United States supports the suggestion of holding elections in the Israeli-occupied areas and expressed that the United States is determined to assist the relevant parties in the Middle East to seek a comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict.

    After the talks, both Bush and Shamir made speeches in front of the White House. Bush reiterated that in order to advance the Middle East peace process, meaningful steps must be taken to ease tensions in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and to conduct political dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians. He said that the United States is committed to achieving comprehensive peace through direct negotiations and believes that it is in Israel's interest to engage in serious dialogue with Palestinians about their legitimate political rights. He said that the United States does not support Israel's sovereignty or permanent occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, but he also said that the United States does not support an independent Palestinian state.

    In his speech, Shamir claimed that peace cannot endanger Israel's security and said that establishing a Palestinian state in the West Bank poses a great threat to Israel. He said that Israel will not hold talks with the PLO on the establishment of a Palestinian state.

　　美支持在以占区自由选举  沙米尔仍拒绝与巴解谈判
    本报华盛顿４月６日电  记者张启昕报道：美国总统布什今天同以色列总理沙米尔就中东问题举行会谈。布什在会谈后强调，美国支持以色列在占领区举行选举的建议，并表示，美国决心协助中东有关各方寻求一项有关阿以冲突的全面解决办法。
    会谈后，布什和沙米尔都在白宫前发表了讲话。布什重申，为了推进中东和平进程，必须采取有意义的步骤缓和西岸和加沙地带的紧张局势，进行以色列和巴勒斯坦人的政治对话。他说，美国对通过直接谈判达成全面和平承担义务，相信以色列同巴勒斯坦人就巴勒斯坦的合法政治权利进行认真对话是符合以色列利益的。他说，美国不支持以色列对西岸和加沙地带拥有主权或者永久占领，但他又说，美国也不支持一个独立的巴勒斯坦国。
    沙米尔在讲话中则声称，和平不能危害以色列的安全，并说在约旦河西岸建立巴勒斯坦国是对以色列的极大威胁，以色列决不与巴解组织就成立一个巴勒斯坦国举行会谈。
