One evening in mid-March. Zhang Zhengshu, the secretary of the Longji Municipal Party Committee in Shanxi Province, warmly entertained a "special guest" dressed in coarse cloth at his home.

Zhang Zhengshu: "Old San, I want to ask you for a favor."

Guest: "What favor? You don't need to ask, just say it."

Zhang Zhengshu: "I want you to be my 'part-time consultant.'"

Guest: "Me? You're not afraid I'll 'fire off some shots'?"

Zhang Zhengshu: "I want to invite you, the 'artillery man.'"

It turned out that the "guest" was San Linhu, the party branch secretary of Liu Village in Pingshun County and a special-grade labor model in Shanxi Province. Two years ago, when the newly appointed secretary of the Longji Municipal Party Committee, Zhang Zhengshu, went to Liu Village, San Linhu bluntly criticized him: "Some of your municipal committee officials are not up to par. They don't stay overnight when they go down to the countryside, they are picked up and dropped off by cars in the morning and evening. Some even go out to stroll the streets themselves, letting others write down the reports they need in their notebooks. This is not like a party cadre at all; it's like a spendthrift. This has something to do with you as the leader." These words made Zhang Zhengshu feel both surprised and shocked. He had not expected a village party branch secretary to speak so frankly to the new municipal party secretary. Later, he investigated and found that there was indeed such a thing. He also used a similarly "unceremonious" method to rectify the work style in the municipal direct organs.

Zhang Zhengshu began to admire San Linhu from this incident. In the subsequent several encounters, San Linhu fired a few more "shots," all of which were hot and doubtful issues that the masses were concerned about. What was even more valuable was that San Linhu, based on his many years of practical experience, could provide many constructive suggestions. Zhang Zhengshu decided to invite San Linhu to be his first peasant consultant.

"To be honest, I fired a shot at you last year, and you took it seriously when you returned to the office. It made me feel a bit embarrassed," San Linhu laughed.

"You're wrong. Why did you fire that shot? Wasn't it for the party's work?" Zhang Zhengshu said humorously, "I am now formally inviting you to be my part-time consultant, hoping to hear more of your 'shots' in the future."

"If that's the case, I'll be this consultant, and I'll do it right away. Tonight, I'll fire another shot." San Linhu took a sip of tea and said, "They say that party and government should be separated, but in some places, they only focus on economics. You say, since everyone is busy with economics, what is the party organization for? You leaders should take a look at the ground. Some village party branches are falling apart. If the higher-level party committee doesn't take charge, who will?"

Zhang Zhengshu listened attentively, nodding frequently and asking a few questions from time to time.

The clock had already struck 11 at night, but the conversation between the secretary and the peasant was still in full swing.

　　市委书记听“放炮”
　　王天平　赵忠保
    ３月中旬的一个晚上。山西省长治市委书记张正书在家里盛情招待一位身着粗布衣的“特邀客人”。
    张正书：“老桑，我想请你给我帮个忙。”
    客人：“帮啥忙？还用请，只管说就是。”
    张正书：“请你给我当个‘业余顾问’。”
    客人：“我？你不怕我放‘炮’？”
    张正书：“我就要请你这个‘炮手’。”
    原来，这个“客人”是平顺县留村党支部书记、山西省特级劳模桑林虎。两年前，新上任的长治市委书记张正书到留村下乡时，桑林虎毫不客气地向他开了一“炮”：“你们市委机关有些干部不像话，下乡不过夜，早晚车接车送，有个别人自己去逛大街，让下边人把要汇报的材料记在他的笔记本上，这哪像党的干部？简直是败家子。这同你们当领导的不能没有关系。”一席话使张正书感到既突然又吃惊。他没有想到一个村支书能在新任市委书记面前拉下面皮说出这番话。后来，他了解了一下，果有其事。他也用同样“不客气”的方式在市直机关干部中来了个作风整顿。
    张正书对桑林虎刮目相看，就是从这件事开始的。这以后的数次接触中，桑林虎又给他放了几“炮”，都是群众注目的热点和疑点问题。更可贵的是，桑林虎根据自己多年的实践经验能提许多建设性的建议。张正书决心请桑林虎做自己的第一个农民顾问。
    “说真的，我去年给你放了一‘炮’，你回到机关就动了真格的，反而闹得我不好意思。”桑林虎笑道。
    “你这就不对了。你为啥放‘炮’，还不是为了党的工作？”张正书风趣地说：“我现在正式请你当我的业余顾问，就是想今后能多听你‘放炮’。”
    “既然这样，我就当这个顾问，而且立竿见影，今晚我就再放一‘炮’”。桑林虎呷了一口茶说：“说是党政分开，有的地方只是一门子抓经济。你说，既然都埋头抓经济，党组织还要它干啥？你们当书记的实地瞅瞅，一些村里的党支部都散架了。上级党委不抓，下边谁当紧？”
    张正书边听边频频点头，不时插问几句。
    时针已指向深夜１１点，书记同农民的交谈意犹未尽……
