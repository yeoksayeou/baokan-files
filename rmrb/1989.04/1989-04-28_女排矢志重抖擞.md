At the National Sports Commission training base by the Dragon Lake in Beijing, the team that trains the longest every day is the Chinese women's volleyball team. When the evening training ends, the staff always has to urge the girls: "Hurry up and go, the water in the bathhouse is getting cold again."

This team is no longer the world champion, and most of the team members have not enjoyed the honor of being world champions. However, they train very hard because they yearn to hold the world champion trophy in their hands again.

The current head coach of the Chinese women's volleyball team, Hu Jin, did not achieve remarkable results with his teammates on the international stage in the past. Now, he pours all his enthusiasm into the team. After taking office, he encouraged everyone by saying: "The Cuban and Soviet teams are not scary. As long as we train properly, we can still defeat them." More than two months have passed, and Hu Jin, taking the Chinese team's match against the Cuban national team in Switzerland this month as an example, commented to the reporter on his young team: "Although we lost 2:3 in this match, the performance of the team members gave us hope. Compared to the old women's volleyball team, our net strength has improved. The average height of the team is 1.81 meters, and the jumping and footwork are also good. The net attack and defense can compete with the Cuban and Soviet teams."

"Of course, the key to defeating the enemy is to play the fast and agile style of the old women's volleyball team. The fast attack tactics that the Chinese team used in the past have been familiar to the opponents, so we plan to develop a few 'new weapons.'"

"Does the Chinese women's volleyball team have a way to counter the strong attacks of the Soviet and Cuban teams?" the reporter asked. "We emphasize using serves to disrupt the opponent's reception. Only by developing serve techniques that can disrupt the opponent's first pass can we weaken their offensive power."

When asked when the Chinese women's volleyball team can regain the world champion title, Hu Jin smiled slightly: "It's hard to say. The team's techniques are still quite rough, and almost all aspects are not comparable to the old women's volleyball team. The gap with the Soviet and Cuban teams is quite obvious, and the momentum of teams like Peru and the United States is also quite strong."

The main attacker Li Guojun said: "When the Chinese women's volleyball team lost the world champion title, it also shed the mental burden. In the past, we were in a strong position, but now we have to challenge others. Every team member has the ambition to be a key player, and this is the potential for a comeback."

　　女排矢志重抖擞
    本报记者  李北大
    在北京龙潭湖畔的国家体委训练基地里，每天训练时间最长的运动队是中国女排。晚上训练结束的时候，工作人员总要催促姑娘们：“赶紧去吧，浴室的水又凉了。”
    这支队伍已经不是世界冠军了，绝大多数队员也没有享受过世界冠军的荣誉，但她们练得很苦，因为她们渴望从自己手里重新捧回世界冠军的奖杯。
    现任中国女排主教练胡进，当年未曾与队友们在国际赛场取得显赫战绩，而今他将全部热情投入女排。上任后就鼓励大家说：“古巴队、苏联队并不可怕，只要我们训练得法，仍然可以打败她们。”两个多月过去了，胡进以本月中国队在瑞士与古巴国家队的比赛为由头，向记者评述手下这支年轻的队伍：“这场比赛尽管我们以２∶３输了，但队员的表现使我们看到了希望。与老女排相比，我们网上实力有所增强，全队平均身高１．８１米，弹跳和脚步移动还可以，网上攻防可以和古巴、苏联队抗衡。”
    “当然，克敌制胜的关键是要打出老女排快速灵活的风格。中国队过去惯用的快攻战术已被对手熟悉，所以我们准备搞几种‘新式武器’。”
    “中国女排有没有办法对付苏联、古巴队的强攻？”记者问。“我们强调以发球带拦防，只有练出能够破坏对方一传的发球技术，才能减弱对方攻击力。”
    说到中国女排何日能重新登上世界冠军奖台，胡进笑了笑：“很难讲，队员们技术还比较粗糙，几乎所有方面都不能和老女排同日而语，与苏、古两队差距相当明显，而且，秘鲁、美国等队的气势也是咄咄逼人。”
    主攻手李国君说：“中国女排丢掉世界冠军的同时，也卸掉了精神包袱。以前我们处在强手的地位，现在要向别人挑战，每个队员都有当主力的雄心，这正是东山再起的潜在力量。”
