There are seven counties and cities in our region with 15 banks and branches that, from last December to the end of February this year, successively detained 29 payments of taxes and funds that should have been remitted to the state, totaling over 2 million yuan. These banks or branches did not promptly transfer the taxes collected by the tax authorities to the national treasury, detaining them for as little as a few days to as long as over a month. For example, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in Taihe County detained over 100,000 yuan in taxes on January 7th and 31st of this year, and as of February 25th, these funds had still not been transferred to the national treasury. Despite repeated urgings from the tax authorities, they paid no heed.

Relevant departments should take measures to stop certain banks from detaining, misappropriating, and occupying state tax revenues.

　　吉安地区银行截留国家税款
    我们地区有７个县市的１５家银行和营业所，自去年１２月至今年２月底，先后截留当地税务部门征收的应上缴国家的２９笔税款和基金，共计２００多万元。这些银行或营业所对税务部门征收交库的税款，不及时划入国库，截留时间少则几天，多则一个多月。如泰和县工商银行今年１月７日和３１日，截留税款共计１００多万元，直至２月２５日尚未划入国库。税务部门再三催促，他们仍置之不理。
    有关部门应采取措施，制止某些银行截留、挪用、挤占国家税款的做法。
