The United States' Optimistic yet Cautious View on Europe's Construction of a Large Market

	New York, April 12 (Xinhua) — U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills today said at the World Trade Conference in Chicago that the United States' attitude towards the European Community's establishment of a unified large market is characterized by six words: "optimistic yet cautious."

	Hills said that the European Community has already become the United States' largest export market. The establishment of the internal market in 1992 by the European Community will benefit American enterprises, with those having subsidiaries there benefiting the most. In 1988, the United States exported goods and services worth $125 billion to the European Community, accounting for one-quarter of the total U.S. exports. Currently, the total direct investment by the United States in the European Community countries has reached $122 billion.

	However, Hills said, the key question is whether the European Community, after removing internal trade barriers, will build trade barriers around itself.

	The European Community has a population of 320 million and a combined gross national product of over $4 trillion, which is roughly equivalent to that of the United States. Therefore, whether the unified European market will be an open economic entity for foreign trade or an exclusive internal fortress is a matter that the United States cannot overlook.

	Hills said that the United States' response to the actions of the European Community is based on the following principles:

	First, the United States supports the European Community in establishing a unified market to promote world economic growth and trade liberalization. Second, the unified market must allow companies from the United States and third countries to enjoy the same rights as companies within the European Community. Third, the unified market should not replace the trade barriers of individual member countries with unified external trade restrictions. Fourth, the unified market should promote multilateral trade liberalization based on the principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

### 对欧洲筹建大市场　美国既乐观又警觉

　　对欧洲筹建大市场　美国既乐观又警觉
    新华社芝加哥４月１２日电　（记者薛力敏）美国贸易代表卡拉·希尔斯今天在这里举行的世界贸易会议上说，美国对欧洲共同体建立统一大市场的态度是六个字：“既乐观又警觉”。
    希尔斯说，共同体已经成为美国的最大出口市场，共同体在１９９２年建立统一内部市场对美国企业有利，其中受益最大的是在那里设有分公司的企业。１９８８年，美国向共同体出口的商品和劳务达到１２５０亿美元，占美国出口总额的１／４。目前美国在共同体国家的直接投资总额已达到１２２０亿美元。
    但是，希尔斯说，关键问题是，共同体在内部铲除掉贸易壁垒后，是否会在共同体的周围建筑贸易壁垒。
    共同体国家共有３．２亿人口，其国民生产总值总计达４万多亿美元，与美国的国民生产总值相差不多。所以，统一后的欧洲市场是个对外贸易开放的经济实体，还是一个排外的内部堡垒，这是美国所不敢忽略的问题。
    希尔斯说，美国对共同体的行动作出的反应均以下述原则为基础：
    第一，美国支持共同体建立统一市场，以利于世界经济增长和贸易自由化；第二，统一市场必须允许美国和第三国的公司同欧洲共同体内的公司享有同样的权利；第三，统一市场不应以统一的对外贸易限制来代替各个成员国的贸易壁垒；第四，统一市场应根据关贸总协定的原则促进多边贸易自由化。
