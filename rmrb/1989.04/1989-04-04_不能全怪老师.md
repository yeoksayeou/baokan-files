Title: It's Not All the Teachers' Fault

Reading the March 7th article in the People's Forum column titled "Suggestion: No Homework for Primary School Lower Grades" (hereafter referred to as "Suggestion"), the author's words are heartfelt and moving. Especially as one's own child is about to enter primary school, hoping that after entering school, the child will not be burdened by homework and lose many things that originally belong to the child, the author also wishes to join the call.

To be honest, the author fully agrees with the "Suggestion" that homework for primary school lower grades is more harmful than beneficial and that homework can be completed within two afternoon classes in the future. However, after reading the entire article, it seems that the article blames the current situation of excessive homework for primary school students on "teachers' good intentions," which seems a bit biased and oversimplifies the problem. In fact, the excessive homework reflects some problems in primary school education in our country.

Firstly, the current primary school lower grade curriculum, including the textbooks in use, may not be suitable for Chinese school-aged children and is worth studying. As far as I know, many primary school lower grade courses are equivalent to the courses of the fifth and sixth grades of the 1950s and 1960s. Of course, this reflects the development of children's education in recent years, but it also reflects the current widespread "urgent need to cultivate people" mentality in the education sector. The problems in the curriculum setting determine that schools and teachers, in addition to ensuring normal class hours of teaching, have to occupy some of the students' extracurricular time. Therefore, teachers assigning homework to students is a helpless measure. Secondly, since the implementation of teacher evaluation in primary and secondary schools, many places have used the student promotion rate as a measure to evaluate teachers' levels. For this reason, teachers always try to use as much time in school as possible to impart knowledge to students, and they have to pass the responsibility of guiding students' homework to the students' parents. Thirdly, the traditional idea of "spare the rod and spoil the child, strict teacher makes a good student" makes many parents also require teachers to "strictly manage and teach" while ignoring the children's various interests. Fourthly, some parents' desire for their children to succeed often does not resent the phenomenon of excessive homework, but rather thinks that if the teacher does not do this, it is neglecting the students. This social atmosphere, to a certain extent, encourages the teachers' actions.

From this, it can be seen that the problem of excessive student homework is not the fault of the teachers alone. As a primary school lower grade teacher said to the author after reading the "Suggestion" article: "We also hope that students can be more relaxed and free after class, but if the students in our class fall behind the curriculum and cannot be promoted in the future, not only will the school leaders be dissatisfied, but the children's parents will also blame us teachers. Assigning homework to students is also something we have to do!" His words are also worth our deep thought: teachers can indeed "show mercy," but can they bear the pressure from various aspects of society? In fact, teachers also look forward to a relaxed teaching environment!

　　不能全怪老师
　　许伯贤
    读３月７日人民论坛栏《建议小学低年级不留家庭作业》一文（以下简称《建议》），其言辞切切，让人动情。尤其是自己的孩子行将跨入小学校门，为使孩子入学后不再受家庭作业之累而失去许多本来属于孩子的东西，本人亦愿加入吁请行列。
    说实在的，对《建议》论述的小学低年级学生留家庭作业弊多利少的观点、今后作业可在下午两节课之内完成的建议，笔者完全赞同。不过，读罢全文，总觉得文章把目前小学生家庭作业量大的状况归咎于“老师用心良苦”，似乎有点偏颇，也把问题看得过于简单了。其实，家庭作业多恰恰反映了我国小学教学方面存在的一些问题。
    其一，现在的小学低年级教学课程，包括正在使用的教科书，是否合乎我国学龄儿童实际，恐怕值得研究。据我所知，现在不少小学低年级课程，相当于五六十年代高小课程，其中当然反映了近年来我国幼儿教学的发展，但同时也反映了目前教育界普遍的“育人求急”的心理。课程设置上的问题，决定了学校和老师除了保证正常课时教学外，只好占用学生部分课外时间。因此，老师给学生留家庭作业，是一种不得已的办法。其二，自从中小学实行教师评级以来，不少地方都把学生升学率作为评定教师水平的一个尺度。为此，老师们总是尽量利用在校课时多给学生灌输一些知识，只好把辅导学生作业的担子“下放”给学生家长了。其三，“棍棒出孝子、严师出高徒”的传统观念，使许多孩子的家长也要求老师“严管重‘教’”，而无视孩子的多种兴趣。其四，一些父母“望子成龙”的心理，对孩子家庭作业多的现象往往不反感，反倒以为老师不这样做，是对学生的放任。这种社会氛围，在一定程度上对老师的做法起了鼓励作用。
    由此可见，导致学生家庭作业多的问题，并非老师单方面之过。正如一位小学低年级老师看了《建议》一文后对笔者说：“我们也希望学生课后轻松一点，自在一些，可要是咱们班的学生跟不上课程，日后升不上去，不但学校领导不满意，孩子的家长也要骂我们老师。给学生布置家庭作业，我们也是迫不得已呀！”他的话也实在值得我们深思：老师们当然可以“高抬贵手”，但来自社会多方面的压力，他们能承受得了吗？事实上，老师们也期待有一个宽松的教学环境啊！
