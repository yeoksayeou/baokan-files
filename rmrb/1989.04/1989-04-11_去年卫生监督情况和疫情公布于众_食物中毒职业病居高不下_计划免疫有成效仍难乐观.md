Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 10th.

A senior official from the Ministry of Health today briefed the capital's media on the country's health supervision work and epidemic situation for the previous year.

Due to the transition of China's health supervision from administrative management to legal management, many systems and measures are still incomplete and incompatible. Since 1984, the qualification rate of food hygiene monitoring has been only 77%; the qualification rate of production environment harmful factor monitoring points is only 57%; the number of food poisoning incidents and poisoning cases remains high every year; occupational diseases occur more than 30,000 times a year, with pneumoconiosis rates remaining high; 40% of middle school students have poor vision, and 10% of primary school students also have poor vision; in 1988, there were 39 radiation accidents, affecting 706 people.

According to statistics from 25 types of infectious diseases reported by 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government (excluding Taiwan Province) in 1988, 17 types of diseases showed a decrease in incidence compared to 1987. Among them, due to large-scale implementation of planned immunization, the incidence of diphtheria, whooping cough, measles, and polio decreased by 37.5%, 44.7%, 8.5%, and 31.9% respectively, reaching the lowest incidence levels since the founding of the nation. The number of rabies cases decreased by 15.7%, and the number of malaria cases decreased by 36.3%.

However, the number of cholera, viral hepatitis, and typhoid fever cases increased by 32%, 24.3%, and 9.3% respectively compared to 1987. Last year, diarrheal infectious diseases accounted for more than 70% of all infectious diseases nationwide, mainly due to unclean drinking water. It is understood that the current sewage treatment rate in China is only 2.4%, and the safe drinking water qualification rate in rural areas is less than 30%.

Last summer, acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (red eye disease) broke out and spread on a large scale in Beijing and Tianjin, with over 1.5 million cases reported; from 1980 to 1988, a cumulative total of over 140,000 sexually transmitted disease cases were reported, with 56,000 cases in 1988 alone; last year, 7 cases of HIV-positive individuals were discovered in China. It is understood that in 1988, the underreporting of infectious diseases in most regions was still relatively serious, and the actual number of cases and deaths was generally higher than the reported numbers.

### 去年卫生监督情况和疫情公布于众　食物中毒职业病居高不下　计划免疫有成效仍难乐观

　　去年卫生监督情况和疫情公布于众
　　食物中毒职业病居高不下
　　计划免疫有成效仍难乐观
    本报北京４月１０日讯　记者艾笑报道：卫生部负责人今天向首都新闻界通报去年我国的卫生监督工作情况和传染病疫情。
    由于我国的卫生监督刚刚从行政管理走向法制管理，许多制度措施不完善、不配套，１９８４年以来的食品卫生监测的合格率仅为７７％；生产环境有害因素监测点达标率只５７％；食物中毒的发生起数和中毒例数每年都居高不下；职业病年发病３万例以上，其中尘肺发病率一直较高；中学生视力低下者占４０％，小学生也达１０％；１９８８年共发生放射事故３９起，７０６人受到辐射。
    据除台湾省外的３０个省、自治区、直辖市１９８８年的２５种传染病报告统计显示，有１７种发病比１９８７年有所下降。其中由于大规模开展了计划免疫，白喉、百日咳、麻疹、脊髓灰质炎发病率分别下降了３７．５％、４４．７％、８．５％和３１．９％，再次降到建国以来最低发病水平。狂犬病发病数下降了１５．７％，疟疾发病数下降了３６．３％。
    但是，霍乱、病毒性肝炎和伤寒副伤寒的发病数却比１９８７年分别上升３２％、２４．３％和９．３％。去年，全国腹泻传染病占各种传染病总发病数中的七成以上，主要是由不洁饮水造成的。据悉，目前我国生活污水处理率仅为２．４％，农村安全饮水合格率尚不到３０％。
    去夏，急性出血性结膜炎（红眼病）大规模爆发流行仅京津二市，发病人数达１５０万余人；１９８０至１９８８年累积报告性病病例１４万多例，其中仅１９８８年就５．６万例；去年在我国已发现艾滋病病毒抗体阳性者７例。据了解，１９８８年多数地区传染病漏报情况仍较严重，实际发病数和死亡数一般要比报告数高。
