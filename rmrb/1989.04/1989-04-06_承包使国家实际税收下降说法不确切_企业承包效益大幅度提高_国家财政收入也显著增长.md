    The Claim That Contracting Leads to a Decrease in Actual State Tax Revenue Is Not Accurate
    Enterprise Contracting Yields Significant Improvements, State Fiscal Revenue Also Shows Substantial Growth

    Xinhua News Agency reports: Reporter Jiang Shijie reports: Regarding recent reports in some newspapers that "contracting enterprises saw a 21.3% increase in profits, yet actual state tax revenue decreased by 9.5%," Chen Lan, a member of the State Economic Restructuring Commission and director of the Enterprise System Reform Department, recently told a reporter that these claims are not comprehensive and are inaccurate. In reality, enterprise contracting has led to a significant increase in state fiscal revenue.

    He said that since the widespread implementation of the enterprise contracting system, economic benefits have significantly improved. From 1979 to 1986, the eight years before the full implementation of the contracting system, the average annual growth in profits for state-owned industrial enterprises within the budget was only 2.73%, and the average annual growth in taxes (turnover taxes) was 11.1%. However, from 1987 to 1988, the two years after the widespread implementation of the enterprise contracting system, the average annual growth in profits for state-owned industrial enterprises within the budget was 11.3%, and the average annual growth in various taxes (turnover taxes) paid to the state by enterprises was 17.2%. The 1988 statistical bulletin published by the National Bureau of Statistics stated that due to contracting, the profits and taxes of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises nationwide increased by 20.8%.

    After the widespread implementation of the enterprise contracting system, state fiscal revenue also showed a significant increase. Before the implementation of enterprise contracting from 1979 to 1986, the annual increase in profits and taxes paid by state-owned industrial enterprises within the budget was only 0.13%. However, after the implementation of enterprise contracting from 1987 to 1988, the annual increase in profits and taxes paid by enterprises to the state reached 11.03%. In 1988, the profits and taxes paid by contracting enterprises increased by 11.8%, and if the power construction fund collected by the state last year is included, the actual profits and taxes paid by enterprises increased by 17.4%. Moreover, this does not include: enterprises repaying bank loans increased by 32.4% compared to the previous year; in addition to paying profits and taxes, enterprises also used their retained profits to pay over 40 billion yuan in energy and transportation funds. In other words, the state obtains fiscal revenue from enterprises through taxes, profits, and fees, and the total amount is continuously increasing. If only one channel of fiscal revenue is calculated, there may be a local decrease. For example, if only the industrial enterprise income tax and regulatory tax are considered, the 1988 figures did indeed decrease by 1% compared to 1987, but these two taxes only account for 21% of the total profits and taxes paid by industrial enterprises to the state, and the impact on the overall situation is not significant. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the state's fiscal revenue decreased after enterprise contracting.

    Chen Lan said that the reason why the income tax and regulatory tax paid by state-owned industrial enterprises nationwide in 1988 decreased by 11.3% compared to the previous year is precisely because some industries and regions did not truly implement the enterprise contracting system.

    He also said that the situation of a decrease in income tax and regulatory tax (i.e., the profits paid) by enterprises should be analyzed specifically. For example, from 1984 to 1986, before the widespread implementation of the contracting system, the annual decrease in income tax and regulatory tax (i.e., profits paid) by enterprises was 17.82%. However, from 1987 to 1988, the annual decrease rate was reduced to 5.63%. This strongly demonstrates that the contracting mechanism effectively stopped this downward trend. In fact, the reason why the income tax and regulatory tax paid by enterprises decreased from 1987 to 1988 is mainly due to the following reasons: first, a significant portion of the profits were converted into turnover taxes; second, due to the implementation of input-output contracting in some industries, the contracting was not truly implemented at the grassroots level of enterprises, and some industries saw an increase in losses, causing the annual decrease rate of income tax and regulatory tax paid by centrally administered industrial enterprises to reach 35.4% (while local industrial enterprises only decreased by 1% in 1988); third, some municipalities implemented the enterprise contracting system relatively late, which also had a certain impact.

    Chen Lan said that, overall, the quality of our country's enterprises is still not high, and there is great potential for improvement. The key is to have a good policy and mechanism, and the contracting system is a relatively good method selected through practice.

### 承包使国家实际税收下降说法不确切  企业承包效益大幅度提高  国家财政收入也显著增长

　　承包使国家实际税收下降说法不确切
    企业承包效益大幅度提高  国家财政收入也显著增长
    本报讯  记者江世杰报道：针对近期有的报纸关于“承包企业利润增长２１．３％，国家实际税收反而下降９．５％”等说法，国家体改委委员兼企业体制司司长陈兰通日前对记者说：这些说法是不全面、不确切的。实际上，企业承包使国家财政有了显著增长。
    他说，企业承包制大面积推行后，经济效益是大幅度提高的。１９７９—１９８６年，即全面推行承包制前的８年，全民所有制预算内工业企业实现利润平均每年仅增长２．７３％，税金（流转税）平均每年增长１１．１％；而１９８７—１９８８年，即普遍推行企业承包制后的两年，全民所有制预算内工业企业实现利润平均每年增长１１．３％，企业向国家缴纳的各种税金（流转税）平均每年增长１７．２％；１９８８年国家统计局发表的统计公报说，全国全民所有制大中型企业由于承包，实现利税增长２０．８％。
    企业普遍推行承包制以后，国家财政收入也显著增长。在实行企业承包前的１９７９—１９８６年，全民所有制预算内工业企业上交利税年递增仅为０．１３％；而实行企业承包后的１９８７—１９８８年，企业上交给国家的利税年递增率达１１．０３％；１９８８年承包企业上交利税增长１１．８％，如果加上去年国家征收的电力建设基金，企业实际上交利税增长１７．４％。而且其中还不包括：企业归还银行贷款比上年增加３２．４％；除上交利税外，企业还用自己的留利缴纳能源交通基金４０多亿元。也就是说，国家是通过税、利、费几个渠道从企业获得财政收入的，总量是不断增加的。如果单算某一个渠道的财政收入，也可会出现局部下降的情况。例如，单就地方工业企业所得税和调节税看，１９８８年比１９８７年确实下降了１％，但这两种税只占工业企业上交给国家利税总额的２１％，对全局的影响不大，因此，不能由此得出结论说企业承包后国家的财政收入减少了。
    陈兰通说，１９８８年全国全民所有制工业企业上交的所得税、调节税之所以比上年下降了１１．３％，主要原因恰恰是有些行业和有些地方没有真正落实企业承包制。
    他还说，对企业上交所得税、调节税（即上交利润这一块）下降的情况要作具体分析。例如，１９８４—１９８６年，即在普遍推行承包制以前，企业上交所得税和调节税（即上交利润）年递减１７．８２％；而１９８７—１９８８年，年递减率降为５．６３％。这有力地说明，是承包机制有效地阻止了这种下降趋势。其实，１９８７—１９８８年企业上交所得税、调节税之所以下降主要有以下原因：一是相当一部分利润转移为流转税了；二是由于实行投入产出包干的一些行业，没有把承包真正落实到基层企业，有个别行业亏损增加，造成中央直属工业企业上交所得税、调节税年递减率达３５．４％（而地方工业企业１９８８年只下降１％）；三是有的直辖市落实企业承包制比较晚，也有一定的影响。
    陈兰通说，从总体上看，我国企业的素质还不高，可挖潜力很大，问题在于要有一个好的政策和机制，而承包制就是在实践中优选出来的比较好的办法。
