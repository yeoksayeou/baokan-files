Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 23rd.

At the conclusion of the 1989 Asian Youth Gymnastics Championships, reporter Bì Jìng interviewed China's national gymnastics team head coach, Gāo Jiàn, at the competition venue this evening. Gāo Jiàn said that this competition was a showcase of the Asian gymnastics reserve strength, and overall, it was quite good, showing significant improvement compared to the past.

Gāo Jiàn said, "In 1975, I led the team to the Philippines for the second Asian Youth Championships. At that time, the young athletes who participated later became the main players of their respective countries, such as Japan's Jù Zhì Jiān, Wài Cūn, Jiā Gǔ, and others. These athletes later competed with us for a decade."

He added, "This time, the age requirement for the men's team is younger than before. If these athletes train well, they will start to grow and mature by next year's Asian Games."

When asked about the Chinese team's performance, Coach Gāo said, "The men's team is relatively better than the women's team, with fewer mistakes. Some of the athletes can be integrated into our national first-team to alleviate the situation of the men's team being short of young talent. In this competition, our team excelled in the parallel bars, pommel horse, and horizontal bar, with some moves reaching world-class standards. For example, Guó Lín Yuè's double backflip on the parallel bars, Nóng Qiáng's backflip with a 180-degree turn on the horizontal bar, and Huáng Huá Dōng's Thomas flip on the pommel horse."

Regarding the women's competition, Gāo Jiàn believed that the participating teams had relatively balanced strengths, with the strongest being China, North Korea, and Japan. From the competition, it was evident that the North Korean team was quite good, but they made too many mistakes, placing them behind the Chinese team. Among these three teams, some outstanding athletes emerged, with strong abilities and many high-difficulty moves. For instance, North Korea's Jīn Guāng Shù performed a 540-degree turn with a front flip on the uneven bars, and Japan's Xiǎo Guǎn Mǎ Lì's floor exercise routine, starting and ending with a tucked somersault, was also notable.

When asked about the performance of the Chinese Taipei team, Gāo Jiàn replied, "The Chinese Taipei team participated for the first time and performed very well, better than I expected. The men's team defeated the Japanese team and was only 0.25 points behind the third-placed North Korean team, showing a certain level in Asia. The colleagues from Taipei hope to strengthen technical exchanges with us. We are very willing to do this. Once the conditions are ripe, they can come here to train, and we can go to Taiwan to teach and conduct training classes."

Coach Gāo concluded, "Of course, from this competition, it can be seen that young athletes are not yet mature, especially in strength-based events like the rings. Additionally, there are many issues with basic skills and basic techniques. For example, the Japanese women's team has good difficulty in their moves, but they lack standardization, making it difficult to reach the highest level. Moreover, the development of Asian gymnastics is still limited, with only four or five teams. More countries and regions need to engage in this sport to improve the level."

### 亚洲体操后备力量有长进  高健教练评述亚洲青年体操锦标赛

　　亚洲体操后备力量有长进    
    高健教练评述亚洲青年体操锦标赛
    新华社北京４月２３日电（记者毕靖）在１９８９年亚洲青年体操锦标赛结束之际，记者今晚在赛场边访问了中国体操队总教练高健。他说，本次比赛是对亚洲体操后备力量的一次检阅，从总体上看还不错，比过去有不少长进。
    高健说：“１９７５年我带队去菲律宾参加第二届亚洲青年锦标赛，当时参赛的年青选手，后来都成为各国的主力。如日本的具志坚、外村、梶谷等。这些选手后来与我们对抗了十年之久。”“这次比赛，男队的年龄要求比过去小，这些选手如果训练得好，明年亚运会就会开始成长和成熟起来。”
    记者问到中国队的情况，高指导说：“男队相对比女队好一些，失误少，其中有些队员将可以充实到我国一线队伍中去，以缓解男队青黄不接的局面。在这次比赛中，我队在双杠、鞍马、单杠中表现出色，有些动作具世界一流水平。如国林跃的双杠后空翻两周挂臂、单杠屈体前空翻越杠抓杠，侬强的单杠后空翻转体１８０度越杠抓杠，黄华东的鞍马托马斯倒立转体接托马斯全旋等。”
    关于女子比赛，高健认为，参赛各女队实力比较平均，最强的是中国、朝鲜和日本队。从比赛看出，朝鲜队相当不错，可惜失误较多，居中国队之后。这三个队中出现了一些好手，她们能力强，有不少动作难度很高，如朝鲜队的金光淑，她在高低杠上表演了大回环转体５４０度接前空翻；日本小管麻里的自由体操成套动作以屈体旋开始，屈体旋结束，也很突出。
    记者问：“这次比赛中国台北队表现如何？”高健回答说：“中国台北队第一次参加比赛表现很不错，比我预想的要好得多。男队战胜日本队，比第三名朝鲜队仅差０．２５分，在亚洲已有一定水平。台北的同行们希望加强与我们之间的技术交流。这一点，我们是非常愿意的，一旦条件成熟他们来我们这里训练也可以，我们去台湾讲学、开办学习班和教学都可以。”
    高指导最后说，当然，从本次比赛看，年轻选手尚不成熟，尤其像吊环那样的力量性较强的项目。另外，基本功、基本技术也有不少问题，像日本女队，动作难度不错，但不规格，很难上到最高水平。另外，亚洲体操运动的发展面还小一点，只有那么四五个队，还需要有更多的国家和地区开展这项活动，提高水平。
