A leading county in grain sales complains: Hundreds of millions of pounds of grain stored outdoors, farmers' grain sales proceeds not fully paid

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 2 (Reporter Zhu Shilong) In March and April, Beijing is in full bloom with peach blossoms and willows, but Daur representative Suhe, who is attending the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress, is worried. This flag leader of Morin Dawa Daur Autonomous Banner (a leading county in grain sales) still has 60 million kilograms of grain piled up outdoors on frozen ground due to insufficient storage capacity, how can he not be anxious?

Suhe, the flag leader, had already actually sold 146 million kilograms of grain by March 11 when he left his hometown for Beijing. However, the 120 million yuan of grain sales proceeds for the farmers have only been paid out 46.23 million yuan, accounting for 37.4%, and another 69.34 million yuan has been converted into grain savings, which cannot be withdrawn even if the bank says it has no money. Additionally, there are 800 million yuan worth of IOUs in the hands of the farmers. As early as January 20, the Agricultural Bank of China had announced that all IOUs in the hands of farmers would be cleared. Suhe, the flag leader, is at a loss. The IOUs have taken away the farmers' grain, but the farmers cannot buy the diesel needed for spring plowing with the IOUs. The flag's granaries are full to the brim, leading to outdoor storage, but there is no funding from above to transport the grain. Various units in need of grain come to negotiate purchases, but the grain sales authority is with the league.

Suhe, the flag leader, said that if the grain purchase funds could be paid out, the farmers in the flag could sell another 40 million kilograms of grain.

　　一售粮先进旗旗长诉苦
    上亿斤粮食堆放露天  农民卖粮款多未兑现
    据新华社北京４月２日电  （记者朱世龙）三、四月的北京，桃红柳绿，可参加七届人大二次会议的达斡尔族代表苏和，面对这满城春意发愁。这位内蒙古莫力达瓦达斡尔族自治旗（售粮先进县之一）的旗长，至今还有６０００万公斤粮食因仓容不足堆在露天的冻土地上，怎不心焦？
    苏和旗长３月１１日离乡进京时，已经实实在在交售粮食１．４６亿公斤。然而农民卖粮价款１．２亿多元却只兑现了４６２３万元，占３７．４％，还有６９３４万元转成了粮食储蓄，这种储蓄只要银行说没钱，你就急用也拿不到钱，另外还有８００万元的白条子在农民手中。早在今年１月２０日，中国农业银行就宣布过农民手中的白条子全部还清。苏和旗长哭笑不得。白条子买走了农民的粮食，农民用白条子却买不来春耕急用的柴油。旗里粮库爆满以致露天存放，上边却无资金来调运。各方需粮的单位来洽购，可是粮食销售权在盟。
    苏和旗长说，如果收粮价款可以兑现，旗里农民还可卖４０００多万公斤粮食。
