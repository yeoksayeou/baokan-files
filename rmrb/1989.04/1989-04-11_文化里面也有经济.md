	Culture Also Has Economics
	Wang Qun

	The People's Daily published an article stating that economics contains culture. As a tourism worker, I found this very thought-provoking.

	Our country's international tourism industry indeed does not pay much attention to the cultural aspects of tourism economics, especially the evening cultural activities for overseas tourists. For example, tourists from Hong Kong cannot enjoy Cantonese opera in Guangzhou; either there are no performances or tickets are unavailable. Such incidents have left many overseas tourists dissatisfied. They say: "Touring China means 'seeing temples during the day and sleeping at night'; 'the nights are like being in a desert.'" Combined with other reasons, the duration of overseas tourists' stay in China has been decreasing year by year, and correspondingly, economic indicators such as hotel occupancy rates and repeat visitor rates have also been declining.

	Economics contains culture, and culture also contains economics. Taking the tourism industry as an example, on February 17 this year, France's cultural and tourism departments signed a cooperation agreement to develop tourism. The agreement states: The characteristic of France's tourism industry lies in its cultural nature. Therefore, the cultural department will increase loans to develop France's cultural tourism, in order to carry out attractive cultural activities at tourist spots and support nearly 2,000 art festivals across the country. This makes me think: China's cultural arts have a long history, but currently, most of their potential has not been realized. Why don't the cultural department and the tourism department work together to build a new pattern of revenue and foreign exchange earnings through culture in the country? This revenue and foreign exchange earnings through culture can enrich the cultural life of foreigners visiting China, earn foreign exchange for the country, and also prepare strength and expand influence for the cultural department to go global. Our country's performing arts troupes are just starting to perform commercially abroad, with a narrow scope and small scale. One of the main reasons is a lack of understanding of the appreciation habits of foreigners. If we can take the tens of millions of overseas tourists visiting China as the target, and use domestic stages as a large experimental field, we can explore ways to earn foreign exchange through culture, which will be beneficial to all parties.

	The famous scholar Yu Guangyuan once said that tourism is both a highly cultural economic endeavor and a highly economic cultural endeavor. I sincerely hope that the cultural and tourism departments will join hands, first take the path of earning foreign exchange through culture, gradually build a pattern of earning foreign exchange through culture, and set an example for other industries in the country to explore cultural value in economics and gain economic benefits in culture.

　　文化里面也有经济
　　王群
    人民日报刊登一篇评论说，经济里面有文化。我作为一名旅游工作者，读后很有感触。
    我国的国际旅游业确实不大重视旅游经济中的文化性，尤其不重视海外旅游者的晚间文化活动，比如香港旅游者到广州看不上粤剧，不是没有演出就是买不到票。诸如此类的事情，使许多海外旅游者不满意。他们说：到中国旅游是“白天看庙、晚上睡觉”；“晚上就像生活在沙漠之中”。加上其他种种原因，海外旅游者在华停留时间逐年下降，相应地，客房出租率、游客重访率等经济效益指标也跟着下降。
    经济里面有文化，文化里面也有经济。还是以旅游业为例。今年２月１７日，法国文化部门和旅游部门首次签定发展旅游合作的协议。协议指出：法国旅游业的特点在于它的文化性质。因此，文化部门将追加贷款发展法国的文化旅游事业，以便在旅游点开展有吸引力的文化活动、资助各地近２０００个艺术节，等等。由此联想到：中国文化艺术源远流长，但目前大部分潜力没有发挥出来。文化部门的同志何不与旅游部门的同志联合，在国内构建创收、创汇文化的新格局？这种创收、创汇文化，既可丰富来华外国人的文化生活，又可为国家赚取外汇，更可为文化部门走向世界准备实力、扩大影响。我国文艺团体出国商业演出刚刚起步，面窄量小。重要原因之一是对外国人的欣赏规律缺乏了解。如果能以来华的数以千万海外旅游者为对象，以国内舞台为大试验场，摸索出文化创汇的路子，对哪一方都是有益无害的事情。
    著名学者于光远曾经说过，旅游既是一项文化性很强的经济事业，又是一项经济性很强的文化事业。真诚地希望文化和旅游部门的同志携起手来，先走文化创汇之路，逐步构建创汇文化的格局，为全国其他行业在经济中发掘文化价值，在文化中获得经济效益带个头。
