Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, April 13th — (Reporter Fan Guanghua) Zhengzhou Economic Auction House, commissioned by the creditors, recently conducted a public auction of the bankrupt Henan Provincial Packaging Food Machinery Technology Center.

The Henan Provincial Packaging Food Machinery Technology Center is a state-owned enterprise. Due to poor management, its liabilities exceeded its assets. After a public trial by the Zhengzhou Intermediate People's Court, it was declared bankrupt. Its inventory of food packaging machinery, food service machinery, and canned food production equipment is valued at 323,000 yuan. These items were auctioned starting at 30% below the current wholesale price.

This auction attracted significant attention from various sectors, and the auction site was quite lively. However, since this type of auction was the first in Zhengzhou and the auctioned items were mostly household food service machinery, the auction results showed that few large items were sold. In over two hours, only 30,000 yuan worth of items were sold.

　　郑州公开拍卖一破产全民企业
    新华社郑州４月１３日电　（记者范光华）郑州经济拍卖商行受债权人委托，近日对已破产的河南省包装食品机械技术中心进行公开拍卖。
    河南省包装食品机械技术中心是一家全民所有制企业。由于管理不善，业不抵债。经郑州市中级人民法院公开审理后，宣告破产。其库存的食品包装机械、饮食机械和罐头生产设备等价值３２．３万元。这些商品均按现行地批发价下浮３０％起拍。
    这次拍卖活动引起了各界的重视，拍卖现场也十分活跃。但是由于这种拍卖活动在郑州还是第一次，拍卖的商品又多属家用饮食机械类，从拍卖结果看，大件货成交不多，两个多小时只成交３万多元。
