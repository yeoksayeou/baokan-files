	The Zhenjiang Eyeglass Factory, known for producing the "Xinmu" brand of eyeglasses, was mistakenly listed as a producer of substandard products just before the Spring Festival. After the error was published in hundreds of newspapers, the entire factory redoubled its efforts to improve internal management, raising the quality of its products to a new level and earning praise from relevant departments.

	The Zhenjiang Eyeglass Factory, originally a township enterprise, was known for its high-quality products and large production volume. It is one of the key eyeglass producers in China. Over the past six years, the factory has won 54 quality management awards at the provincial and municipal levels. On February 3 of this year, Xinhua News Agency published a list of substandard products from the State Bureau of Technical Supervision. Due to a typographical error, the name of another enterprise was mistakenly listed as the Zhenjiang Eyeglass Factory, causing significant confusion within the factory. Suddenly, commercial departments issued notices to return goods, and previously agreed contracts were halted. Facing this situation, the factory director, National People's Congress representative, and outstanding farmer-entrepreneur Wu Binrong convened numerous meetings, including party, administrative, and team-level gatherings, within a few days. On one hand, efforts were made to stabilize the emotions of all employees; on the other hand, teams were organized to identify 11 potential weak links that could have led to substandard products entering the next production stage, thus turning the situation around.

	Wu Binrong told reporters, "Although a single character error resulted in over a million yuan in losses for us, it also prompted a comprehensive review of the thoughts, technologies, and product quality of all our employees and management."

　　伪劣名单张冠李戴　一字之差损失百万
    镇江眼镜厂蒙冤不馁抓质量
    本报讯  多次被评为优质产品的“新目”眼镜生产厂家镇江眼镜总厂（前镇江市眼镜厂），春节前夕被误列为劣质产品厂家，在几百家报纸公布以后，全厂上下积极加强内部管理，使产品质量更上一层楼，受到有关部门的好评。
    镇江眼镜厂原是一家乡镇企业，产品数量大，质量上乘，是我国眼镜重点生产厂家之一。近６年来，该厂在质量方面曾获省、市２３次５４项质量管理成果奖，今年２月３日，新华社发表国家技术监督局公布的劣质产品名单时，因一字之误，把另一企业的名称错成镇江眼镜厂，在该厂引起很大混乱。一时间，商业部门通知退货，原定合同停止签署。面对这种情况，该厂厂长、全国人大代表、优秀农民企业家吴斌荣在短短几天内就主持召开了从党内到行政、班组等十几种会议。一方面做好工作，安定全厂职工情绪；一方面组织人员查出１１个可能有疏忽而导致劣质产品流入下道工序的薄弱环节，使局面发生了变化。
    吴斌荣对记者说：“一字之误，虽然给我们带来了上百万元的损失，但对我们全厂干部职工思想、技术、产品质量进行了一次检查。”
