	Firmly Implement the Policy of Rectification and Reform
	—Report on the Work of the Government
	Delivered at the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress
	Premier of the State Council, Li Peng

	Comrades and Deputies,

	Rectifying the economic environment and rectifying the economic order are the key tasks for China's construction and reform in the next two years, and they are also the key tasks for the government's work. Therefore, I, on behalf of the State Council, will mainly report on this issue to the Congress for your deliberation.

	I. Focus on Rectification and Reform

	1988 was the tenth year of China's reform and opening up. Over the past ten years, China has undergone tremendous historical changes in all aspects. Social productivity has significantly increased, the country's economic strength has been notably enhanced, and the living standards of urban and rural residents have improved markedly. Practice has proven that the line adopted since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is correct. The year 1988 that has just passed was a year of continued progress in China's socialist modernization.

	The national economy continued to grow. The total national output value reached 1385.3 billion yuan, an 11.2% increase over the previous year in comparable prices. The total national income reached 1153.3 billion yuan, an 11.4% increase over the previous year in comparable prices. Despite frequent natural disasters nationwide, grain production decreased by 2.2% and cotton production by 1.1%. However, many other agricultural products and diversified operations continued to develop, and the total agricultural output value still increased by 3.2%. Farmers actively delivered grain to support national construction, and the national grain procurement task has been basically completed. Industrial production, transportation, and postal and telecommunications services continued to develop. The production of steel, coal, electricity, and petroleum increased significantly, and the growth of daily industrial and agricultural products that are in short supply was even faster. The labor productivity of industrial enterprises increased by 9.3% compared to the previous year, and the energy and electricity consumption per 10,000 yuan of industrial output value decreased by 5.63% and 5.65% respectively. Based on this growth, the living standards of most urban and rural residents continued to improve.

	Key projects achieved new successes. Nationwide, 78 large and medium-sized basic construction projects were completed and put into operation, and 138 important individual projects within large and medium-sized projects were completed. A batch of key power stations, coal mines, railways, and ports were completed and put into operation, adding momentum to modernization construction. The main production capacities newly added nationwide include: 9.99 million kilowatts of installed power generation capacity, 30.9 million tons of raw coal mining, 15.77 million tons of crude oil mining, 600,000 tons of ethylene, 2.46 million tons of cement, 7.92 million metric tons of flat glass, 419 kilometers of railway operational mileage, 820 kilometers of railway double-track mileage, 1,487 kilometers of railway electrification mileage, and 8.78 million metric tons of coastal port handling capacity.

	The reform of the economic system continued to deepen. The enterprise contract responsibility system gradually improved, and the vitality of enterprises further increased. Many enterprises, through optimizing labor combinations, improved labor productivity. Markets for commodities, funds, technology, services, and foreign exchange have seen new developments. In terms of macro-control, reforms in planning, investment, materials, finance, foreign trade, and other aspects have been gradually carried out, and the management of finance, taxation, banking, prices, auditing, customs, and industrial and commercial administration has been initially strengthened.

	Opening up to the outside world was further expanded. The total import and export volume exceeded 100 billion US dollars, an increase of 24.4% over the previous year, and the proportion of industrial manufactured goods in exports increased. Actual utilization of foreign capital was 9.84 billion US dollars, an increase of 16.4% over the previous year. 5,940 new foreign-invested enterprises were approved, the most in ten years. The completion of business volume for overseas contracting projects and labor cooperation was nearly 1.3 billion US dollars. The foreign exchange earnings from international tourism reached 2.22 billion US dollars, a significant increase over the previous year.

	Based on economic development, achievements were made in science and technology, education, culture, health, and sports. The underwater launch of a ballistic missile from a nuclear submarine was successfully tested, and the Beijing Electron-Positron Collider successfully collided, indicating that China has made significant progress in several aspects of high technology. The construction of socialist democracy and socialist legal system was strengthened. The reorganization of the State Council has been basically completed according to the plan approved by the First Session of the Seventh National People's Congress. Public security, security, and judicial departments have done a lot of work to maintain social order. The People's Liberation Army has played a great role and made outstanding contributions in defending the motherland, supporting socialist modernization construction, and disaster relief.

	While we have achieved results in various aspects of work, we also face many problems and difficulties, the most prominent of which is the obvious inflation, excessive price increases, and the overall retail price index rose by 18.5% compared to 1987. Such a large price increase exceeded the tolerance of the masses, enterprises, and the state. The actual living standards of a considerable number of urban residents have declined. These situations have attracted widespread social attention and caused serious concern among the masses, affecting social stability and the masses' confidence in reform. If we do not take decisive measures to curb inflation, not only will the economy be unable to stabilize and develop, but various reforms will also be unable to deepen.

	The intensification of inflation is the result of economic overheating, dual inflation of investment demand and consumption demand, and social total demand exceeding total supply. Nationwide, there are too many fixed asset investment projects under construction, the scale is too large, exceeding the country's ability to bear; consumption demand is too strong, the growth of social purchasing power exceeds the growth of commodity supply; the state's fiscal expenditure exceeds revenue, the scale of credit is too large, and the issuance of currency is too much. At the same time as the total supply and demand are imbalanced, the economic structure is disordered, agricultural development is lagging, limited resources are over-invested in processing industries and non-production construction, and in the situation of high-speed growth of industrial production, the tension of energy, raw materials, and transportation capacity has been aggravated. Some units and individuals, for personal gain, engage in illegal buying and selling, layer-by-layer speculation, and produce and sell counterfeit and shoddy goods, further pushing up prices and exacerbating economic disorder.

	The occurrence of the above situation is inseparable from the fact that it is still not possible to quickly form a new mechanism of self-regulation and self-restraint during the transition period from the old to the new system. At the same time, there are also shortcomings and mistakes in our guidance of work. Generally speaking, in economic construction, there is a tendency to seek quick results. Our country is a developing country and needs a certain economic growth rate, but often ignores the actual situation of a large population, relatively scarce resources, and unbalanced economic development. In guidance, attention is not paid enough to preventing blindly expanding the scale of construction, one-sidedly pursuing output and quantity, and comparing development speeds, and there is a lack of correction. The direction of reform is correct, and overall it is successful, but in guidance, we often lack a sufficient understanding of the arduousness and complexity of reform, pay insufficient attention to comprehensive coordination, and in the process of insisting on decentralization and activation, we have not timely strengthened management and supervision and grasped the establishment of a macro-control system. At the beginning of last year, we formulated the policy of stabilizing the economy and deepening reform, but due to the overly optimistic assessment of the economic situation in 1987, we did not insist on putting economic stabilization first in implementation, and the actions were not firm and the measures were not effective. We have recognized the important position of price reform in the overall economic system reform, but in actual work, we have not sufficiently considered the tolerance of the state, enterprises, and the masses, and in the situation of obvious inflation, we have not timely taken effective measures to stabilize finance and control prices, but instead relaxed and adjusted the prices of some commodities, which exacerbated the masses' panic over price increases and triggered panic buying of commodities and a decline in savings in many places.

	The Thirteenth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, held in September last year, correctly analyzed China's economic situation, proposed the policy of rectifying the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and comprehensively deepening reform, and determined the deployment to focus on rectification and reform in the next two years. To implement such a policy and deployment, we must unify stability, reform, and development, and promote reform and development in stability. Starting from this year, we will use two years or more to strive to achieve the goals of rectification and reform: (1) Eliminate economic overheating and bring the development speed to a more reasonable level. (2) Curb inflation and make the price increase in 1989 significantly lower than in 1988, and further reduce the price increase after 1990. (3) Reduce the scale of fixed asset investment to match the country's ability to bear, and control the rapid growth of consumption funds to match the growth of national income. (4) Gradually ease the contradiction of social total demand exceeding total supply and achieve basic balance in finance, credit, materials, and foreign exchange. (5) Seriously adjust the economic structure to increase the production of major agricultural products such as grain, cotton, and oil, and ease the tension in the supply of energy, transportation, and raw materials. (6) Establish and improve necessary economic regulations and the macro-control and supervision system, and actively promote the construction of a new order for socialist commodity economy. Only by achieving these goals can we significantly improve the quality and benefits of China's economy and ensure the long-term stable development of the national economy.

	Since the Thirteenth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council and governments at all levels have done a lot of work to rectify the economic environment and rectify the economic order, and have achieved initial results.

	—Efforts were made to reduce the scale of fixed asset investment. By the end of February this year, 18,000 fixed asset investment projects nationwide have been stopped or delayed, which can reduce investment in the next few years by 64.7 billion yuan, accounting for 12% of the remaining work of all projects. However, the goal of cleaning up and reducing the scale has not been achieved, and the task is still very arduous.

	—Credit scale was controlled, savings were increased, and financial stability was maintained. Due to the implementation of the tight monetary policy, the credit scale has been controlled. Banks have twice raised savings interest rates and launched savings protection and prize-saving campaigns, playing the role of economic leverage, and the savings deposits of urban and rural residents nationwide have gradually rebounded. At present, on the one hand, the circulation of currency nationwide is still too large; on the other hand, many places and enterprises feel a shortage of funds, which needs to be solved seriously under the premise of insisting on tight monetary policy by adjusting the credit structure and other measures.

	—Social collective purchasing power was reduced. The number of controlled commodities was expanded from 19 to 32, and the retail sales last year decreased by 9.1% compared to the previous year. The collective consumption of units at the county level and above last year increased by 1.8% compared to the previous year. The phenomenon of using public funds for dining, entertaining, gift-giving, and traveling has decreased in party and government organs. However, waste is still very serious in all aspects and must be solved urgently.

	—A nationwide financial, tax, and price inspection was carried out, and a total of 7.41 billion yuan of illegal funds that should be turned over to the state treasury was found, of which 5.65 billion yuan has been turned over. Through the inspection, a number of tax evasion, profit retention, illegal price increases, illegal charges, embezzlement, and bribery cases were handled, and the management of taxation, finance, and prices was initially strengthened.

	—The order in the circulation field was rectified. The cleanup and rectification of various companies are being carried out in earnest, focusing on checking companies established since 1986 and companies in the circulation field. By the end of January this year, 17,092 companies that do not meet the conditions or should not be established have been merged or dissolved; of the 24,187 companies established by party and government organs, nearly 20,000 have been merged or decoupled from the organs, accounting for about 80%. Of the more than 40,000 party and government officials and retired cadres holding positions in companies, more than 70% have resigned from their company or government positions or have completed the relevant procedures as required. The phenomenon of party and government organs engaging in business and running enterprises has been basically stopped. In the cleanup, a number of illegal and disciplinary cases were handled, including some major cases. The cleanup and rectification of companies will continue to be carried out in depth. For some important products and scarce commodities, management has been strengthened, and some have been put under monopoly operation, which has curbed the behavior of price hikes, panic buying, and illegal resale, and has played an active role in establishing market order and stabilizing prices.

	—Efforts were made to increase effective supply. While reducing social total demand, support was provided from the aspects of funds, materials, foreign exchange, and transportation to increase the production of agricultural and sideline products such as grain, cotton, oil, meat, poultry, eggs, and vegetables, to support the production of daily industrial products necessary for people's lives, and to support the production of scarce commodities and foreign exchange-earning commodities, basically ensuring the supply of the domestic market and the needs of foreign trade development. The market during the Spring Festival this year was relatively abundant in goods and rich in variety.

	After half a year of work, economic overheating has started to cool down, the momentum of price increases has weakened, the masses' anxiety about prices has eased, and urban and rural markets have basically stabilized.

	We believe that the following two points should be made about the rectification and reform in the past half year: First, the policy and measures for rectification and reform determined by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council are correct. As long as these policies and measures are firmly implemented without wavering, and new situations are timely studied and new problems are solved, the difficulties on the way forward can definitely be overcome. Second, the achievements made are only initial. There is still a big gap between the goals to be achieved by rectification and reform. At present, many comrades still have an insufficient understanding of the necessity and arduousness of rectification and reform. The difficulty of rectification and reform itself is great, and it will bring some new difficulties in some aspects, but if rectification and reform are not insisted on, the difficulties in all aspects will be greater. We can only face difficulties and press on, and we must not give up halfway.

	To firmly implement rectification and reform, we must solve the following three problems in our ideological understanding. First, governments at all levels, government officials, especially those in charge, must firmly uphold the authority of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, firmly uphold the authority of the State Council's leadership over government work, and firmly uphold the authority of laws and regulations, and must ensure that orders are followed and prohibitions are obeyed. Historical experience repeatedly proves that adjusting the economy and overcoming difficulties is impossible without necessary concentration and unity and strict organizational discipline. Second, carrying out rectification and reform inevitably requires necessary adjustments to the existing interests. All localities, departments, and units must consider the overall situation and firmly establish the idea that local interests should be subordinate to overall interests. If this is not the case, everyone will not give up the vested interests that hinder the overall situation, and rectification and reform will become mere talk. Third, during the period of rectification and reform, the government and the people must be prepared to have a few years of tight living conditions. Starting from the State Council, governments and departments at all levels, and a large number of cadres, especially leading cadres, must take the lead in practicing thrift and hard work, and resolutely overcome the phenomenon of waste. As long as we set an example and clearly explain the objective requirements of having a tight living condition to the masses, we believe that the broad masses of the people will understand and support us. In short, the State Council requires governments and departments at all levels to further raise their awareness, unify their thoughts and actions with the policies of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, unite the masses, and focus on rectification and reform to make unremitting efforts to stabilize the economy and deepen reform.

	II. The Current Focus of Rectification and Reform is Still to Reduce Social Demand

	The inflation in China in recent years is mainly caused by economic overheating and excessive demand. Rectifying the economic environment and rectifying the economic order, of course, require efforts from both reducing social demand and increasing social supply, but first of all, we must firmly reduce the excessive social total demand.

	Reducing the scale of fixed asset investment is a major measure that has a decisive impact on reducing social total demand and is the primary task of curbing inflation and stabilizing the overall economy. The State Council has decided: the scale of fixed asset investment nationwide this year should be reduced by 92 billion yuan compared to last year, a decrease of 21%; of which, the scale of investment by state-owned enterprises should be reduced by 51 billion yuan, a decrease of 19%. Although many measures have been taken in this regard, there is still a significant gap with the above requirements, and the progress is very uneven, and we must make great efforts to persist in carrying it out.

	The key to reducing and controlling the scale of fixed asset investment is to clean up the projects under construction. Only by resolutely canceling a large number of projects under construction can the scale of investment be truly reduced. Not only should a large number of buildings and non-production construction projects be canceled, but also a number of production construction projects should be stopped or delayed; not only should projects that should not be started be resolutely stopped, but also some projects that should be started should be reasonably arranged according to the possible financial and material conditions and other conditions. All departments and localities must strictly follow the industrial policies and the list of projects under construction issued by the State Council, and clean up and cancel the projects that should be stopped or delayed, and do not allow false reporting. It is necessary to strengthen the macro-control of fixed asset investment activities nationwide, use economic, legal, and necessary administrative measures to manage not only the investment activities arranged by the state plan but also especially strictly control the investment activities outside the plan and budget. Bank investment loans should be managed by directive plans, and non-bank financial institutions should be prohibited from engaging in investment and credit activities, and the expansion of fixed asset investment scale through social fundraising should be strictly limited. During the period of rectification and reform, it is necessary to strictly control the commencement of new projects, and those that have not been approved according to regulations are not allowed to start construction; those that have started construction without authorization must be strictly held accountable by the construction units and their supervising departments. Effective measures must be taken to firmly maintain the seriousness of the state plan and policy, and those places and units that violate the state plan and policy should be subject to appropriate economic and administrative penalties.

	In the process of rectification and reform, it is also necessary to firmly control the rapid growth of consumption demand. The focus of controlling consumption demand is: first, to firmly reduce and control social collective consumption. The national social collective purchasing power this year should be reduced by 20% based on the level of 1988. Second, strictly control the growth of the total wage bill and resolutely stop the issuance of bonuses, materials, and the expansion of the scope of allowances and subsidies. Strengthen the management of the wage fund, rectify and improve the wage and bonus issuance methods of enterprises, especially various companies, rectify and strengthen the management and supervision of enterprises' own funds, and strictly levy bonus tax and wage adjustment tax according to state regulations. Third, vigorously advocate and encourage people's savings, and adopt various methods to correctly guide consumption and absorb and postpone the realization of social purchasing power. Increasing urban and rural residents' savings is both necessary and possible, and it is beneficial to both the country and the people. It is necessary to carry out extensive and in-depth propaganda and education, and adopt various effective measures that are convenient for people to save, and promote savings activities nationwide. All macroeconomic management departments and supervisory departments must take responsibility and strengthen the control and supervision of consumption demand. Whether it is the state, enterprises, or individuals, they must further establish the idea of improving life on the basis of developing production, consciously restrain excessive consumption desires, oppose various forms of waste, and carry forward the fine tradition of thrift and hard work.

	While reducing social total demand, it is also necessary to strive to improve and increase effective supply to ease the supply and demand contradiction in the market and meet the needs of people's lives and national construction. The effective supply mentioned here mainly refers to important agricultural and sideline products such as grain, cotton, oil, meat, poultry, eggs, and vegetables, daily industrial products necessary for people's lives, light textile products that are suitable for the market, agricultural industrial products, commodities that can recover a lot of currency and are in short supply, and export commodities that can earn foreign exchange, as well as transportation, energy, and scarce raw materials that are indispensable for production and life, rather than requiring an increase in the production of all products indiscriminately. The key to improving and increasing effective supply lies in vigorously applying and promoting advanced scientific and technological achievements and management methods, fully tapping the potential of existing enterprises, reducing material consumption, improving product quality, increasing labor productivity, and improving the efficiency of fund use. All industries must carry out long-term, in-depth, and solid "increase production and reduce consumption, increase income and reduce expenditure" campaigns, and truly take the road of developing social production by improving economic benefits.

	The State Council has decided to hold a national labor model commendation conference during the 40th anniversary of the founding of the country to encourage excellence, summarize experience, and promote the in-depth development of the "double increase and double reduction" movement, further promoting China's reform and construction.

	In coordination with the reduction of social total demand, finance and credit must also implement a tight policy, continue to tighten the money supply, and strictly control the issuance of currency. After the national economic plan and the state budget are deliberated and approved by the National People's Congress, all departments and governments at all levels under the State Council must firmly implement them. Every effort must be made to stabilize finance, and the planning management of various bank loans must be strengthened to control the total credit scale of the whole society, especially to strengthen the management and supervision of non-bank financial institutions and various fundraising activities. Under the premise of reducing the total supply of funds, the credit structure should be reasonably adjusted, and the necessary should be guaranteed while the unnecessary should be reduced, so that there is flexibility within tightness. The principle of basic balance between fiscal revenue and expenditure must be adhered to, and fiscal deficits should be gradually reduced. All localities and departments should practice thrift and reduce expenditures, and at the same time, strive to open up new sources of revenue.

	III. Seriously Rectify the Economic Order, Especially the Circulation Order

	After years of reform and opening up, the vitality of enterprises has been enhanced, and the market has been continuously expanded, which has strongly promoted the development of productive forces. However, in the transition from the old to the new system, there are many contradictions and loopholes, and the construction of the legal system and the macro-control system is not sound, and there are many chaotic phenomena in the fields of production, construction, and circulation, especially the chaos in the circulation order is quite serious. To ensure the healthy development of construction and reform, it is necessary to seriously rectify the economic order, especially the circulation order, and resolutely promote the construction of a new order for socialist commodity economy.

	The rectification of the economic order, especially the circulation order, first of all, must continue to clean up and rectify various companies. In this regard, relevant departments of the State Council must take the lead in doing a good job. The focus of the cleanup and rectification is to solve the problems of some companies where government and business are not separated, officials and merchants are not separated, illegal resale, and seeking excessive profits. Various companies must be decoupled from party and government organs in terms of finance, materials, wages, and other aspects, and establish and improve various financial systems to change the current chaotic situation in these aspects. All departments and localities must publicize the situation and results of the cleanup and rectification of companies to the public and accept the evaluation and supervision of the masses. The cleanup and rectification work must be combined with regular supervision and management. Industrial and commercial administrative departments must strengthen annual inspections and strictly approve the business qualifications, business scope, and business methods of various companies. The establishment of new companies must strictly follow the approval procedures and prevent the phenomenon of cleaning up on one side and expanding on the other.

	To ensure that the price increase this year is significantly lower than last year, it is necessary to strengthen the management of prices and the market and strictly enforce financial and economic discipline. Prices and charges for production materials and living materials managed by the State Council, and all departments, localities, and enterprises are not allowed to raise prices and increase charges arbitrarily. Prices and charges managed by local governments at all levels must be strictly controlled according to the regulations of the State Council. For important agricultural and sideline products, industrial consumer goods, and some non-planned production materials with the highest price limit stipulated by the State Council, the regulations must be strictly enforced. Large and medium-sized cities should list some main subsidiary food and other daily necessities, and take comprehensive measures such as supporting production and financial subsidies to ensure the market supply of these commodities and maintain the basic stability of prices. Governments at all levels must strengthen the guidance and supervision of price liberalization. For relatively important commodities, the enterprise price increase reporting system must be strictly enforced, and reasonable regional, purchase and sale, and wholesale and retail price differentials must be regulated to reduce circulation links, stop intermediate speculation, and stop transferring the burden through price increases in different places. The cultivation of various commodity and material trading markets should be continued, and market trading rules should be strictly enforced to promote the openness and voucherization of trading activities. The role of state-owned material enterprises and commercial enterprises in absorbing and adjusting the market and stabilizing prices should be fully valued and utilized. Strengthen the tax collection and administration of various enterprises and individual industrial and commercial households. Strengthen the inspection and supervision of various management departments such as industrial and commercial administration, prices, taxation, statistics, measurement, technical supervision, and health quarantine on various markets, and give full play to their respective functions, and closely cooperate in division of labor. Promote fair trading, clear pricing, and stop unfair competition and underground transactions. Fully utilize the role of consumer associations and price inspection personnel, and adopt various forms such as setting up reporting centers to encourage the masses to participate in market supervision. Resolutely crack down on and eliminate illegal behaviors such as monopolizing the market, speculation, and price gouging. All types of enterprises must strictly implement the state's various financial, tax, and price policies, operate legally, and pay taxes legally. For units or individuals that evade taxes, underreport taxes, resist taxes, and engage in other illegal business activities, they should be punished by law, and those who violate criminal laws should be held criminally responsible.

	Seriously rectify and improve the circulation methods of important commodities. For important production materials, except for those under monopoly operation, they should all enter the market according to regulations for open trading. For important production materials, scarce durable consumer goods, and other commodities that are clearly stipulated by the state for monopoly operation, units and individuals not allowed by state policies are not allowed to operate. Monopoly departments must strictly implement the state's monopoly operation methods and price policies, always consider the interests of users and the masses, and resolutely prevent seeking excessive profits by taking advantage of monopoly positions. No unit or individual is allowed to take advantage of the dual-track pricing system to illegally resell planned commodities and materials and seek excessive profits. For grain, cotton, silk, live pigs, and other scarce agricultural and sideline products, it is necessary to prevent mutual blockade between regions and prevent price hikes and panic buying between regions, and as far as possible, establish relatively stable cooperative relations through economic means, actively develop various forms of regional economic cooperation, and reasonably resolve the distribution of interests between regions.

	IV. Adjust the Economic Structure During Rectification and Reform

	Only by seriously adjusting the economic structure during rectification and reform can we prevent the occurrence of stagflation, improve the quality and benefits of the national economy on the basis of optimizing the structure, and ensure and promote the long-term stable development of China's economy. The basic direction and tasks of the current structural adjustment are to concentrate efforts on developing agriculture, energy, transportation, and basic raw materials industries, strengthen industries and products that can increase effective supply, and enhance the momentum of economic development; at the same time, control the scale and speed of development of processing industries to make them coordinated with the development of basic industries.

	First, strengthen the basic position of agriculture in the national economy and strive for a good harvest of major agricultural products such as grain, cotton, and oil this year.

	Agriculture is currently the weakest link in the national economy. Strengthening the basic position of agriculture and striving for a good harvest of major agricultural products such as grain, cotton, and oil this year, and maintaining the stable development of other crops and forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries, are of special importance in curbing price increases and stabilizing the overall economy. The development of agriculture relies on the implementation of stable rural policies and the deepening of reform, the promotion and development of advanced agricultural science and technology, and the increase of agricultural investment to enhance the momentum of agricultural development.

	To mobilize farmers' enthusiasm for increasing grain and cotton production, the State Council has decided: from April 1 this year, the procurement price of contract-purchased grain will be increased by an average of 18%; continue to improve the policy of linking contract-purchased grain with low-priced fertilizers, diesel, and pre-purchase deposits, and appropriately increase the supply of linked fertilizers; grain outside the contract-purchased scope will be traded in the market, and prices will be determined by the market. At the same time, the purchase price of cotton will be appropriately increased when new cotton is put on the market.

	To increase investment in agriculture, despite the tightening of fiscal and financial policies this year, the State Council has decided that the central government's investment in agriculture, including forestry and water conservancy, will not only not be reduced but will also be increased. Local governments and other sectors should allocate more financial resources to increase agricultural investment. To stabilize and increase agricultural investment, starting from this year, funds will be raised and established from various channels to form an agricultural development fund. This includes: appropriating a portion from extra-budgetary funds, appropriating all or a portion from the taxes of township and village enterprises, land occupation tax, agricultural and forestry special product tax, and individual and private enterprise taxes in rural areas, and appropriating a certain proportion from foreign loans for the development of agriculture, which opens up a stable source of growth for agricultural development funds. At the same time, the Agricultural Bank of China and credit cooperatives plan to increase agricultural loans by 17.2 billion yuan this year, and adjust the structure of the existing nearly 80 billion yuan of agricultural loans to support the construction of national and local commodity grain, cotton, and sugar production bases, support the development of agricultural resources and the matching construction of agricultural infrastructure, support the implementation of the "vegetable basket" project, and focus on the development of meat, poultry, aquatic products, and vegetable production. Efforts should be continued to do a good job in poverty alleviation and help poor areas get rid of poverty and become prosperous. Actively encourage and guide farmers to invest more funds in agricultural production and development, which is the main channel for increasing agricultural investment. To ensure that farmers use their limited funds for production, the phenomenon of arbitrary levies and charges in some places must be strictly stopped. Resolutely crack down on illegal business activities that harm farmers. All industries should support agriculture. The relevant departments of the State Council and local people's governments should ensure the supply of energy and raw materials needed for the production of fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural films. Fully tap and expand the existing capacity of fertilizer production, and resolutely complete this year's fertilizer production and supply tasks. At the same time, encourage farmers to actively apply more organic fertilizers to improve soil structure. To ensure a good harvest, it is necessary to attach great importance to the construction of agricultural land and water conservancy projects, strengthen the management of rivers, improve disaster resistance, and especially ensure the flood control safety of major rivers.

	The household contract responsibility system with family farming as the mainstay is in line with the current level of agricultural productivity development in most regions of China and still has strong vitality. It should be maintained and continuously improved. It is advocated to establish a multi-level and multi-form rural socialized production service system and make them gradually complement each other to promote the development of rural commodity economy. In a few places that truly have the conditions, the household contract responsibility system can be gradually implemented in a step-by-step manner with the consent of the masses to further improve agricultural labor productivity. Developmental agriculture should be operated on a scale as much as possible.

	The development of township enterprises is of great importance and far-reaching significance in supporting agricultural production, increasing farmers' income, expanding employment opportunities for surplus rural labor, and promoting the development of the national economy. Township enterprises should, according to the national macro-control requirements and market needs, appropriately reduce the development speed during the period of rectification and reform, seriously rectify and improve the business style, adjust the product structure, improve product quality, reduce material consumption, improve labor productivity, and actively prevent and control pollution. Township industries should mainly develop the processing of agricultural and sideline products, the production of certain raw materials, and the production of supporting urban industries, and the production of export commodities that can earn foreign exchange. The funds needed by township enterprises should mainly rely on their own accumulation.

	Second, strive to strengthen the construction of basic industries and basic infrastructure such as energy, transportation, communications, and important raw materials, and gradually ease the current tension in these aspects.

	While vigorously reducing the scale of fixed asset investment, it is necessary to take effective measures to support the construction of energy, transportation, communications, and important raw materials industries. The development and construction of these industries must also adhere to the principles of ensuring key projects, supporting advanced projects, emphasizing benefits, and distinguishing between different situations, and cannot be developed simultaneously to make the limited financial and material resources play a greater role.

	The solution to the energy problem should adhere to the principle of giving equal importance to development and conservation. The coal industry should strengthen the construction of state-owned coal mines and continue to support and guide the healthy development of local coal mines. At present, it is especially necessary to take effective measures to help state-owned coal mines get out of economic difficulties and change the abnormal situation of stagnation and decline in the production of township coal mines. The petroleum industry should, while striving to find new reserves and continuously developing new oil fields, fight a tough battle on old oil fields to maintain the stable growth of crude oil production. The construction of the power industry should adhere to the principle of everyone participating in power generation, develop thermal power, hydropower, and nuclear power according to local conditions, and strive to increase power generation capacity. At the same time, further strengthen the work of energy conservation. It is necessary to promote and adopt energy-saving technologies universally, widely implement energy-saving contracts, and vigorously advocate energy conservation in all government agencies, organizations, enterprises, and residents. Strict monitoring and inspection systems should be implemented for key energy-consuming units and equipment. For small-scale calcium carbide, small ferroalloys, small blast furnaces, small electric furnaces, small electrolytic aluminum, and small refineries that have high energy consumption, low efficiency, and large pollution, production and construction should be strictly controlled. In the raw materials industry, the iron and steel industry should actively adjust the product structure in development, improve quality, increase short-supply varieties, improve the yield, reduce consumption, and greatly increase economic benefits. Non-ferrous metals, chemical raw materials, and forestry industries should also seriously adjust the product structure and develop appropriately. Strengthen geological exploration work to provide mineral resources for the development of energy and raw materials industries. All localities, departments, and enterprises must attach great importance to the conservation and comprehensive utilization of raw materials as a major task to improve economic benefits.

	The tension in transportation has become a prominent problem in China's current economy and society, and it is necessary to give it a more important position. Actively develop a comprehensive transportation system with railways as the mainstay, and strive to improve the comprehensive efficiency of the transportation system. Railway construction should focus on strengthening the capacity of coal transportation from Shanxi and certain bottlenecks. While strengthening the construction of new lines and the technical renovation of old lines, further tap the potential of existing facilities. Highways should strengthen the construction of main lines and improve the capacity of trunk highways. Port construction should be strengthened to give full play to the role of water transportation. The construction of civil aviation should be continued. Reasonably organize transportation and improve management. Strictly implement the supervision and inspection system for traffic safety to prevent the occurrence of major accidents. Continue to accelerate the development of the postal and telecommunications industry.

	Third, strictly control the scale and speed of development of processing industries to make them coordinated with the growth of agriculture, energy, raw materials, and transportation capacity.

	In recent years, the development of processing industries, especially general processing industries, has been too fast, and blind production and repeated construction have been quite serious, and many products have poor quality and high material consumption. This situation not only causes the overall tension of agricultural products, energy, raw materials, and transportation, but also seriously affects the effective use and reasonable allocation of production factors. Efforts should be made to change this situation, which is not only an important link in the current adjustment of the economic structure but also the key to improving social economic benefits. The principles and requirements for adjusting the structure of processing industries are to reduce and control long-supply products, increase and develop short-supply products, focus on improving product quality, and comprehensively strengthen management to make processing industries make significant progress in improving quality.

	In the light industry, it is necessary to strictly limit and eliminate a batch of market-stagnant and low-quality products, control products that consume a large amount of grain, energy, and scarce raw materials, and strive to increase brand-name and high-quality products and market-shortage products. It is necessary to develop new products and varieties that are suitable for the market and purchasing power of urban and rural residents at different levels, especially to increase the production of daily consumer goods that meet the needs of rural areas.

	In the machinery and electronics industry, for products that are over-supplied, have poor performance, and consume a lot of electricity, production should be strictly limited; products that have been officially announced for elimination should be prohibited from production. At the same time, efforts should be made to develop and produce machinery and electronics equipment and basic components needed by energy, raw materials, transportation, and communications industries, and increase the production of agricultural machinery and other agricultural tools that are suitable for use. Actively absorb and digest introduced technologies, greatly increase the production of products that can replace imports, and improve the level of domestic production of machinery and electronics products.

	In order to adjust the industrial structure as mentioned above, it is also necessary to reasonably adjust the organizational structure of enterprises, regional economic layout, and consumption structure, and implement policies of focusing on key areas and supporting the strong and limiting the weak in investment, credit, finance, taxation, prices, and other aspects, truly support the aspects that need to be strengthened and encouraged, and truly limit the aspects that need to be controlled and prohibited, and vigorously promote the rationalization of the overall economic structure and the optimal allocation of resources. To this end, the State Council has issued the "Decision on the Key Points of the Current Industrial Policy," and all localities and departments should seriously implement it and continuously enrich, improve, and perfect it in practice.

	V. Ensure the Development of Science and Technology and Education During Rectification and Reform

	The development and progress of science and technology are the true hope for China's economic revitalization. In the rectification, reform, and adjustment of the national economy, it is necessary to take the promotion of technological progress in industrial and agricultural production, especially key industries, as an important goal, and rely on science and technology and scientific management to achieve the optimization of industrial structure and the improvement of economic benefits. To ensure the development of science and technology, governments at all levels should continue to increase scientific and technological funds this year, and implement policies that are conducive to scientific and technological progress when adjusting the structure of investment and credit. Enterprises and rural areas should also do their best to increase investment in technological development activities. At present, scientific and technological work should focus on the main battlefield of economic construction, organize and implement the national key scientific and technological research projects, technological transformation projects, and "Spark" and "Harvest" projects during the Seventh Five-Year Plan, and actively promote scientific and technological achievements with universal practical value. The indicators related to technological progress should be included in the indicator system of enterprise contract management. Large and medium-sized enterprises should strive to enhance their technological development capabilities, and small enterprises, including township enterprises, should also have their own technological support. Rural areas should establish and improve the agricultural technology promotion and service system. To enhance national strength and support the future development of the economy and society, high-tech research and development should be carried out in a planned and focused manner. Through the implementation of the "Torch Plan" and other measures, the commercialization and industrialization of high-tech achievements should be promoted. At the same time, basic research and applied basic research should be valued and supported. In recent years, the reform of the scientific and technological system has made significant progress. The reform of the supporting and perfecting work should be further done well to promote the formation of a mechanism for the close integration of science and technology with the economy. The scientific research fund system should be enriched and improved, the role of the patent system should be fully played, the technology market should be cultivated and developed, and various forms of cooperation between scientific and technological units and enterprises should be vigorously promoted to mobilize and organize a large number of scientific and technological personnel to make continuous contributions to economic construction.

	Fundamentally speaking, promoting scientific and technological progress and improving economic benefits, and even achieving the overall goal of socialist modernization, all depend on the improvement of the quality of laborers and the cultivation of specialized talents. In recent years, China's education has developed rapidly, and a number of regions and departments that attach importance to education and have achieved remarkable results have emerged. However, from an overall perspective, China's education is backward, and the development and reform of education do not meet the needs of socialist construction. After the First Session of the Seventh National People's Congress, the State Council organized the State Education Commission and other relevant departments to conduct extensive and in-depth discussions on a series of major issues in education work. The State Council will continue to listen to opinions from all sides and promptly formulate the outline for the development and reform of China's education by the end of this century. Governments, departments, and all industries at all levels should further improve their understanding of education, highly value the long-term and important strategic position of education, and ensure the development of education during the period of rectification and reform. In 1989, despite the tightening of various fiscal expenditures, the State Council has decided to not only not reduce but also significantly increase education funds. The government's education funds will reach 37.4 billion yuan, an increase of 5 billion yuan over last year, a growth of 15.4%. In addition, the extra-budgetary education funds such as urban and rural education surcharges will also increase significantly. Of course, this is still far from meeting the actual needs of education development, and the State Council and governments at all levels should, through increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, do their best to increase education funds in the implementation of the budget. In the long run, solving the problem of insufficient education funds relies not only on increasing government fiscal appropriations. It is necessary to reform and make education a matter for the whole people and a responsibility for the whole people, and increase the investment of the whole society in education. While continuing to increase government fiscal appropriations and clearly defining the proportion of education funds that governments at all levels must bear, it is necessary to actively reform the school system, develop social forces to run schools, open up new channels for raising education funds, and strengthen the management and audit supervision of the use of education funds to prevent embezzlement and waste. In recent years, some places have actively taken various measures to mobilize the enthusiasm of all sectors of society and the people to develop education, and promoted the development of education. Practice has proven that education is related to the vital interests of the people, and there is a great deal of enthusiasm for developing education in society. As long as leaders at all levels attach importance to it, seriously summarize these new experiences, and continuously improve them, it is completely possible to gradually increase the proportion of education funds in the gross national product.

Title: Promote the Development of Education and Deepen Reform
Author:
Date: 1989-03-26
Edition: 1

To develop the education sector, we must start from China's actual situation, rationally plan the speed, scale, and focus of development, determine an appropriate structure and proportion, and continuously improve the investment efficiency and social benefits of education. Due to significant differences in economic and cultural foundations among regions, while emphasizing the responsibilities of local governments, we must also grant them greater authority to coordinate and make decisions, enabling them to determine major issues in education based on local conditions. We must strive to adapt to the needs of socialist construction, further adjust the educational structure, carry out educational reforms, and closely integrate the continuous improvement of educational universalization with the development of vocational and technical education, making education better serve the improvement of laborers' quality. All levels of government must seriously implement the Compulsory Education Law, adhere to the principles of active, firm, quality assurance, zonal planning, and local adaptation, further revise and implement the compulsory education plan, and establish a target responsibility system to promote the implementation of compulsory education. The "Spark Plan" to cultivate mid-level and primary-level scientific and technological talents in rural areas and improve the quality of rural laborers is a comprehensive social project of profound significance for carrying out rural education reforms and promoting rural development. All regions must promptly arrange and implement this plan and strive to achieve results. Cities should explore methods for enterprises and schools to collaborate in developing vocational and technical education, further implement the principle of "training first, employment later," and actively carry out reforms in secondary specialized and technical education. We must stabilize the overall scale of higher education, focusing on improving educational quality. We must seriously carry out comprehensive reform experiments in higher education, further adjust the structure of departments, enhance the adaptability of majors, and improve the supply-demand matching and dual-selection system for graduate allocation. Higher education institutions should engage in various forms of social services to strengthen the connection between schools and society, improve the social benefits of education and research, and adhere to unified organization and arrangement by schools, establishing and improving relevant systems. Adult education should focus on strengthening the training of in-service workers, and take effective measures to formulate specific plans and goals, and focus on eliminating illiteracy. We must guide the enthusiasm of social forces to support the development of basic education and vocational and technical education. We must further activate the academic atmosphere of education, strengthen the research of educational science and theory, actively explore the reform of educational ideas, content, and methods, and continuously improve educational quality.

The development and reform of education must rely on and fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of teachers, and strive to cultivate a team of teachers with excellent quality. We must plan and step-by-step strengthen teacher training, expand the sources and channels for cultivating teachers. We must continue to take measures to improve the working and living conditions of teachers. At the same time, we must deeply carry out the reform of the internal management system of schools, optimize the teacher team, and continuously improve the ideological and professional quality of the broad masses of teachers.

The fundamental task of schools is to educate people. All levels and types of schools must place the improvement and strengthening of ideological and political education in an important position and effectively carry out the construction of school spirit and discipline. For the current chaotic phenomena in some schools, such as arbitrary fees, issuing fake diplomas, teachers and students engaging in business, and lax teaching discipline, as well as the problem of some students dropping out or quitting school in some places, all levels of government and education departments must attach great importance to it, take effective measures to correct it, and strive to create a good environment for teaching and educating people.

Six, Combine Rectification and Order with Deepening Reform

Rectifying the economic environment and restoring economic order are being carried out under the premise of adhering to the general direction of reform. We will never return to the old economic model of excessive centralization and excessive, detailed, and rigid control, nor will we take the path of privatization that denies the socialist system. Many of the rectification and order measures we are currently taking are themselves important components of deepening reform. Good rectification and order cannot be separated from deepening reform. Emphasizing rectification and order does not mean that reform can be halted. Good rectification and order can create a better environment for deepening reform at the macro level, better promoting the development of socialist planned commodity economy.

The 1989 economic system reform will focus on improving and developing the various reform measures that have been introduced, while also exploring new reforms in conjunction with rectification and order. The key is to continue to improve and develop the contract responsibility system for industrial and commercial enterprises, actively explore measures and methods to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation, cultivate an orderly market, and alleviate the contradictions of unfair distribution. All reforms must be closely centered around the task of rectification and order, achieving the goals of compressing demand, adjusting structure, increasing effective supply, and improving economic efficiency.

To improve and develop the contract responsibility system for enterprises, we must focus on the bidding and contracting of large and medium-sized enterprises, striving to standardize and institutionalize the process, and reduce administrative interference. We must actively promote full-staff risk mortgage contracting, linking the interests and risks of managers and workers with the operating conditions of the enterprise, mobilizing the enthusiasm of managers and workers, and enhancing the enterprise's self-discipline and adaptability to market changes. We must continue to promote and improve the form and method of linking the total wage of enterprises with the realization of profits and taxes, the increase of labor productivity, and the reduction of raw material consumption, preventing the increase of enterprise benefits solely through product price increases. We must seriously implement the Enterprise Law and Bankruptcy Law, continue to promote the factory director responsibility system, and rationalize the leadership relationship within the enterprise. Enterprises have the right to decide on the establishment of organizations based on their own conditions, and higher-level relevant departments should not insist on matching positions. Through the introduction of the competition mechanism, we can optimize the management personnel structure and labor combination, which is an important way to improve labor productivity. Redundant personnel should be mainly absorbed internally or new employment opportunities should be created, and conflicts should not be pushed to society.

We must continue to develop and improve horizontal economic cooperation and coordination, while also correcting some negative trends that have emerged in the process of cooperation. Guided by industrial policy and adhering to the principles of voluntariness and paid transfer of property rights, we must actively promote the rationalization of enterprise organizational structure. We must steadily promote the stock system with public ownership as the mainstay. Small industrial and commercial enterprises can continue to promote leasing operations, and some can be publicly auctioned. The development of enterprise groups, the implementation of enterprise mergers, and the trial of the stock system must be carried out in a unified and step-by-step manner, and must not be rushed or done in a disorderly manner. We must resolutely prevent and correct the wrong practices of selling state assets at low prices or even embezzling them, as well as expanding consumption funds in disguise.

To adapt to the requirements of reform and opening up and the development of a planned commodity economy, it is very important to strengthen and improve the macroeconomic regulation system. We lack experience in this area and must actively explore it in practice. During the rectification and order period, we must strengthen macroeconomic regulation by comprehensively using economic, administrative, legal, disciplinary, and ideological and political work measures, with a focus on more economic measures. Whether using economic measures or administrative measures, we must strive to formulate necessary regulations and systems to avoid subjectivity and arbitrariness. We must pay attention to maintaining the stability and continuity of policies. Major decisions should be thoroughly discussed and verified in advance to improve the democratic and scientific level of decision-making.

We must actively and steadily deepen the reform of the planning and investment system. The planning department must strengthen and improve the comprehensive balance of the national economy, making the plan able to regulate and guide the economic development of the whole society, and focusing on guiding and regulating the use of extra-budgetary funds, consumption funds, and the operational direction and behavior of non-state-owned economic entities. This will promote the balance of the total economic volume and the coordination of the economic structure, serving the development of socialist commodity economy. According to the industrial policies issued by the state, we must implement a reasonable investment tilt policy and reform the investment system to guide and strengthen investment in energy, transportation, raw materials, and other basic industries, promoting the adjustment of investment structure and industrial structure.

Strengthening and improving macroeconomic management, we must pay special attention to the role of banks in regulation. According to the state's industrial policy and import and export policy, we must fully utilize economic tools such as interest rates, re-loans, reserve ratios, and reserve funds to control the issuance of currency, regulate the scale and structure of credit, and guide the healthy operation of the economy. The People's Bank of China undertakes the functions of a central bank and must strengthen unified management and strengthen vertical leadership. Various specialized banks also undertake the responsibility of macroeconomic regulation and must not affect or weaken this responsibility due to the implementation of enterprise management. Various levels of government must support the work of banks, not interfere with the specific business of banks, and certainly not force banks to issue loans. We must clean up and rectify various non-bank financial institutions, clarify the scope of business and the direction of fund use. We must continue to develop the short-term money market in an orderly manner, organize fund lending and other forms of fund transactions, and serve production and circulation. Banks must strengthen the cash management system, develop modern settlement methods such as bills, and through measures such as increasing interest rates and improving services, further stabilize and increase urban and rural residents' savings, and increase the recovery of currency.

Strengthening the audit supervision system is an important part of strengthening macroeconomic regulation. We must resolutely implement the relevant provisions of the Constitution on auditing and the Audit Regulations issued by the State Council, making auditing work gradually become regular, institutionalized, and standardized. Currently, we must pay special attention to auditing basic construction, administrative and public institution expenditures, consumption funds, and circulation activities. We must strengthen statistical work and give full play to the supervisory role of statistics.

We must actively study the reform of the financial system, gradually rationalize the relationship between the central and local governments, and gradually implement a composite budget, separating regular financial expenditures from government investments. The tax authorities and personnel must gradually implement a system mainly based on vertical leadership. In areas with conditions, we must continue to conduct trials of changing from pre-tax repayment to post-tax repayment, gradually moving towards the separation of taxes and profits. Currently, the proportion of national financial revenue in national income is too low, and the proportion of central financial revenue in total financial revenue is also low. We must take effective measures to adjust the distribution structure and appropriately concentrate funds. We must further strengthen the tax authorities, improve various tax laws, regulations, and systems, clean up, rectify, and clarify the management authority of various levels of government over various tax exemptions, and reduce serious tax losses.

To curb the expansion of consumption demand and alleviate the contradictions of unfair social distribution, we must gradually improve the distribution system. The current wage system for government agencies and public institutions must continue to be reformed and improved. Enterprises must promote and improve the system of linking the total wage with economic benefits, making the growth of workers' wages truly based on the improvement of labor productivity and economic benefits. We must resolutely eliminate illegal income and protect legal income. Starting this year, we will quickly establish and improve the personal taxable income declaration system, further strengthen the collection of personal income adjustment tax, and adjust the excessive income gap. This work will start from large cities, first implemented in various levels of leadership agencies, various types of company personnel, and individual industrial and commercial households. Paying taxes in accordance with the law is the obligation and responsibility of all taxable entities and individuals, and we must, through extensive and in-depth propaganda and education, make all enterprises and citizens cultivate the concept of law-abiding tax payment, and resolutely fight against all tax evasion and fraudulent activities.

We must actively promote other reforms that are conducive to curbing inflation, controlling social demand, and correctly guiding consumption. We must continue to reform the housing system for urban residents, reasonably formulate unified principles, classification standards, and pricing methods for the sale of public housing. Through the gradual implementation of housing commodification, we can promote the development of the construction industry and other related industries, and promote the rationalization of the consumption structure. We must continue to conduct pilot reforms of the social insurance and social security system. We must give full play to the role of the insurance industry in organizing economic compensation, accumulating construction funds, stabilizing people's lives, and guiding the flow of consumption funds. We must deepen the reform of the labor system and employment system, develop and improve the labor market. We must clean up and reduce planned employment, and strictly control the blind inflow of rural labor into cities.

Seven, Actively Develop Opening Up During Rectification and Order

This round of rectification and order and economic adjustment is different from previous economic adjustments, as it is being carried out under the condition of opening up to the outside world. The international economic environment is relatively favorable to us. We must make full use of this favorable condition to expand foreign trade and strengthen economic and technological cooperation with the outside world, making opening up and rectification and order mutually promote each other.

We must adhere to the implementation of the development strategy for coastal areas and continue to develop an export-oriented economy. This is beneficial for alleviating the domestic tension in the supply of raw materials, fully utilizing the advantage of abundant labor resources, and promoting the achievement of the goals of rectification and order. Coastal areas must seize the opportunity, make use of their strengths and avoid their weaknesses, timely adjust the economic structure, continuously improve the economic quality, and strive to increase the proportion of "two ends abroad" products in export trade. We must take practical and effective measures to further utilize various forms of cooperation with foreign businesses, such as "import to support export" and "three in one compensation," and vigorously open up the international market. Coastal areas must also actively rectify the economic environment, restore economic order, and in the development of an export-oriented economy, they must not rush in a disorderly manner or compete to expand the preferential conditions for opening up, nor must they engage in mutual comparison in pursuing high consumption. We must correctly handle the economic relationship between coastal and inland areas, making them cooperate and promote each other on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and jointly develop.

Efforts must be made to ensure the continued development of foreign trade this year, which is very important for stabilizing the overall economy. We must actively develop export production and continue to implement relevant policies and measures to encourage exports. From the perspective of the needs of rectification and order, foreign trade exports must adhere to the principle of coordinating domestic and foreign sales, adjusting the export structure, gradually reducing the export proportion of resource-based products and initial processing products, increasing the export of mechanical and electrical products and other industrial manufactured goods, developing the export of foreign exchange-earning agricultural products, and increasing the export of deep processing and high-tech products. We must also update product styles and varieties, improve product quality, and enhance competitiveness in the international market. Foreign trade enterprises must further strengthen and improve management, strive to tap potential, and improve the utilization rate of funds. We must uphold the tradition of "honoring contracts and keeping promises" in China, strive to overcome the shortcomings in current foreign trade work, and improve China's foreign trade credibility. Foreign trade imports must also be adjusted according to the needs of rectification and order and industrial policy, strictly limiting the import of some high-end consumer goods, using limited foreign exchange to import raw materials, agricultural production materials, advanced technologies, key equipment, and components urgently needed for national key construction and domestic agriculture and industry production, alleviating the supply and demand contradictions in the domestic market, and promoting economic development. We must plan and organize the expansion of border trade, coordinate the development of the tourism industry, actively open up the international market for contract labor services, improve the economic benefits of overseas contract projects and labor cooperation, and strive to increase foreign exchange earnings.

We must actively utilize foreign capital and introduce advanced technology, which is our long-term unchanging policy. Whether it is now or in the future, the absorption of foreign capital and the introduction of technology must comply with China's industrial policy. We must encourage and attract foreign businesses to establish more sole proprietorships in China and more joint ventures and cooperative enterprises that utilize existing Chinese enterprises for transformation. We must strengthen the unified management of foreign exchange and foreign debt, appropriately control the scale of foreign debt, and improve the efficiency of foreign capital utilization. We must continue to improve the investment environment, improve economic legal systems, help foreign businesses solve practical difficulties, and ensure that foreign businesses operate legally. We must strictly adhere to the agreements and contracts already signed with foreign businesses.

The direction of foreign trade system reform in recent years has been correct, and the achievements are the main ones. During the rectification and order period, we must continue to deepen the reform of the foreign trade system, strengthen macro management and supervision, implement the unified foreign trade policy of the state, establish a good order for foreign trade, and overcome the chaotic phenomena in foreign trade. We must conduct a serious clean-up and rectification of the situation of the decentralization of import and export operating rights in the previous period, and cancel the operating rights of those who do not meet the conditions and have no credibility. In the future, the main operating rights for imports and exports will be granted to large and medium-sized enterprises or enterprise groups that have the conditions and credibility, supporting them to operate freely according to national policies and open up the international market.

Eight, Strive to Create a Good and Stable Social and Political Environment

Adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles, giving full play to political advantages, and striving to create a good and stable political and social environment is an important guarantee for the smooth implementation of the task of rectification and order.

According to the deployment of the 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, China's political system reform is being actively and steadily promoted. The separation of party and government and organizational reform have taken important steps, the system of democratic consultation and dialogue is being actively promoted, and the situation of an imperfect legal system is gradually changing. During the period of economic rectification and order, we must further strengthen the construction of socialist democracy and the socialist legal system, safeguard the democratic rights of the broad masses of the people, adhere to and improve the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party, give full play to the role of democratic supervision and consultation of democratic parties, non-party patriotic personages, and mass organizations, strengthen the construction of grassroots political power organizations in urban and rural areas, consolidate and develop a stable, united, democratic, and harmonious political situation. Any social turmoil and disorder are not conducive to the construction and reform, seriously harm the fundamental interests of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, and are contrary to the wishes of the broad masses. We must carry out extensive legal education to enhance the legal awareness of the people. On the basis of implementing the Constitution and various laws, we must improve administrative regulations and systems and strictly enforce the law. All levels of government and departments must take the lead in observing laws and disciplines, while supporting and supervising the judicial administrative departments to exercise their powers in accordance with the law. Through strengthening democratic supervision and law enforcement work, we must uphold political discipline and national laws, severely punish those who seriously disrupt the economy, resolutely crack down on and severely punish those who seriously endanger social order, and resolutely crack down on criminal activities such as gangsters, prostitution, and human trafficking. All levels of government must mobilize and organize the strength of the broad masses, pay attention to and give full play to the role of urban residents' committees and rural villagers' committees, implement comprehensive governance, strengthen social security, and jointly maintain a good production order, work order, study order, and life order.

The reorganization of the State Council has been basically completed according to the original plan, and the main task this year is to consolidate the achievements of the reform, further rationalize the relationship between departments and within departments, and gradually realize the transformation of functions in actual work and improve work efficiency. To concentrate on the task of rectification and order, the reorganization of government agencies at the provincial, municipal, and autonomous region levels, which was originally scheduled to begin this year, has been decided to be postponed.

The economy must develop, and the government must be clean. The State Council and all levels of government must take the lead in implementing a series of clean government systems formulated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, setting an example. We must severely investigate and punish leaders and directly responsible persons who violate state regulations by arbitrarily distributing money and goods, using public funds for banquets and gifts, extravagant dining, traveling, and building private houses; severely investigate and punish serious bureaucratism and dereliction of duty by state officials, especially leading cadres; we must uphold the seriousness of political orders and laws, resolutely correct the phenomena of disobedience to orders and prohibitions, and lack of organization and discipline. For matters directly related to the interests of the broad masses, we must actively promote the system of open administration and open the results of administration. We must increase the transparency of government activities, strengthen the constraint mechanism, and make all powers subject to the constraints of laws, systems, and the supervision of the broad masses of cadres and the people. The departments of industry and commerce administration, taxation, prices, auditing, customs, and public security, which are responsible for law enforcement and supervision, must strengthen their own construction, improve the political and professional quality of their staff, uphold justice, and effectively fight against illegal and disciplinary violations. All levels of supervision departments must focus their work on investigating and punishing bribery, extortion, extravagance and waste, and various acts of using power for personal gain, resolutely curb corruption, concentrate forces to investigate and punish major cases in a timely manner, and make the results public to exert a deterrent effect, making the work of clean government effective.

Building socialist modernization must adhere to the simultaneous development of material civilization and spiritual civilization, making them complement and promote each other. A nation with low spiritual civilization cannot achieve modernization. All levels of government must attach great importance to spiritual civilization construction and put this work on the important agenda. In the condition of vigorously developing socialist commodity economy, we must not only talk about material interests but also oppose the idea of "everything for money." Building a new order for socialist commodity economy not only needs a new management system and corresponding laws and regulations, but also needs the popularization and improvement of social ethics, professional ethics, and civilized etiquette. We must vigorously advocate the spirit of devotion to the country and society, advocate the social customs of mutual respect, mutual care, mutual help, and respect for the elderly and love for the young. In the new situation of reform and opening up, we must earnestly strengthen and improve ideological and political work, adhere to the education of patriotism, collectivism, and socialism, conduct education on self-reliance, hard work, carrying forward revolutionary traditions, and strengthening national self-esteem, self-confidence, and self-improvement, cultivating a generation of new people with socialist ideals. We must adhere to the direction of serving socialism and the people, earnestly implement the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, through the development of necessary social material and cultural conditions and appropriate public opinion environment, formulate and implement economic policies in the cultural field, strengthen the rectification, management, and construction of the cultural market, and ensure and promote the healthy development of culture and art. We must give full play to the role of news, publishing, radio, film, and television in promoting spiritual civilization construction, actively publicize the advanced deeds and advanced individuals of "realizing the four modernizations and revitalizing China." Broad theoretical workers should, in combination with the actual situation of reform and opening up and modernization construction, deepen the research on the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and use new theoretical achievements to answer the questions raised by real life. We must persistently carry out mass activities to change customs and habits in cities and towns. We must not allow reactionary, obscene, and ugly things to spread freely; we must resolutely ban activities that disrupt social order and poison people's minds, such as feudal superstition and gambling, in accordance with the law.

Developing sports and enhancing the physical fitness of the people is an important part of building spiritual civilization. We must strive to carry forward the noble sports style and the spirit of struggle for the glory of the motherland, and successfully host the 1990 Asian Games in China. We must do a good job in health work, actively implement the policy of prevention first, extensively carry out patriotic health campaigns, and improve the health level of the people. The aging of the population is increasingly becoming an important issue in our society, and all regions and departments should pay attention to the work of the elderly.

Implementing family planning, controlling population growth, and improving population quality are related to the progress of China's four modernizations and the survival of the Chinese nation, and are China's basic state policy. The total population of mainland China is about to reach 1.1 billion, and it is currently at the peak of population growth, so we must not relax control over population growth. All levels of government must fully understand the necessity and urgency of controlling population growth, combine the control of social total demand with the control of population growth, and strengthen the leadership of family planning work. We must firmly, conscientiously, and comprehensively implement the current family planning policy, advocate late marriage and late childbearing, fewer and better births, and adhere to the policy of one child per couple, while taking effective measures to resolutely stop multiple births and early marriage and childbearing. Minority nationalities should also advocate family planning for the benefit of economic development and social progress.

Strengthening environmental protection is also one of China's basic state policies. All levels of government must regard environmental protection as an important issue related to the overall situation of economic development and social development, strengthen leadership, take decisive measures, and control the development of environmental pollution. We must mobilize all aspects of society to plant trees, afforest, and green the motherland, further improving the ecological environment.

In the period of economic adjustment and throughout the entire modernization construction period, we must consolidate and develop the socialist ethnic relations of equality, unity, and mutual assistance. This is in the fundamental interests of all ethnic groups in the country and is a guarantee for the realization of the four modernizations and the common prosperity of all ethnic groups. We must continue to mobilize and organize all aspects of society to help minority areas better develop their economy and culture. We must firmly implement the Law on Regional National Autonomy, quickly formulate specific implementation regulations, and effectively safeguard the autonomy of autonomous regions, vigorously cultivate minority cadres and scientific and technological management talents. For the actual problems that exist in the rectification and order of minority areas, we must study and adopt corresponding policies and measures. The problems that occur in the current stage of ethnic relations in China generally belong to the category of contradictions among the people based on the fundamental interests of unity, and should be resolved through democratic consultation, the implementation of ethnic policies, and the re-education of ethnic policies. We must respect the freedom of religious belief of citizens and the customs of minority nationalities, and protect normal religious activities.

Recently, some separatist elements have caused unrest in Lhasa, attracting the attention of all ethnic groups in the country. To maintain national unity and ethnic unity, maintain social order, and safeguard the personal and property safety of the people, the State Council has decided to impose martial law in Lhasa, which has been supported by the broad masses of Tibetan people and the people of the whole country, striking a blow to the reactionary arrogance of a few separatist elements. Now, the social order in Lhasa is gradually returning to normal, and people's lives are becoming stable. Our current administrative policies, such as supporting and promoting the economic and cultural development of Tibet, protecting the freedom of religious belief of the Tibetan people, and respecting local customs, will not change. The Dalai Lama, as long as he gives up the idea of "Tibet independence" and does not engage in separatist activities, and maintains national unity and ethnic unity, the central government is willing to negotiate with him. It is well known that the Tibet Autonomous Region is an inseparable part of the territory of the People's Republic of China, and anyone who advocates "Tibet independence" will not succeed. Any foreign forces, regardless of the pretext, supporting the separatist activities of "Tibet independence" are gross interference in China's internal affairs and are absolutely unacceptable.

Strengthening national defense construction is of great significance for safeguarding China's national interests and state security. In the period of economic adjustment and throughout the entire process of modernization construction, we must attach importance to national defense construction, making China's national defense forces compatible with its national status. The People's Liberation Army must continue to serve the overall situation of national construction, do a good job in its own construction and reform, and continuously enhance its combat effectiveness. We must further develop national defense science and technology and do a good job in the construction of national defense reserves. All levels of government must care for and support the army, actively and proactively help them solve various practical problems, and do their best to create good conditions for the construction and reform of the army. We must carry forward the glorious tradition of loving the government and the people, loving the army and caring for the families of soldiers, and further strengthen the relationship between the army and the government and the army and the people. We must carry out regular national defense education nationwide and incorporate it into the entire national education system, continuously enhancing the national defense consciousness of the whole people. At the same time, we must gradually improve various national defense laws and regulations to ensure the smooth progress of national defense construction.

Comrades!

In the past year, the Chinese government, in order to implement the Sino-British and Sino-Portuguese Joint Declarations on the Hong Kong and Macao issues, has conducted good cooperation with the British and Portuguese governments. Officials from both sides and the Sino-British and Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Groups have reached agreements on a series of issues related to a smooth transition through consultations. The draft of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, which was formed after extensive consultation and repeated revisions, has been reviewed and published by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and is currently being further consulted. After further revision, it will be submitted to the Third Session of the Seventh National People's Congress for approval. The drafting work of the Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative Region has also begun last year and is expected to be completed in 1993. The relevant departments of the State Council have actively participated in and coordinated with the drafting work of the two Basic Laws led by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. We believe that with the further implementation of the Sino-British and Sino-Portuguese Joint Declarations, the economic ties between the mainland and Hong Kong and Macao will definitely develop further, and this will have a more positive promoting effect on China's reform and opening up and the stability and prosperity of the Hong Kong and Macao regions.

In recent years, the relationship between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait has undergone significant changes. The long-term tense confrontation and mutual isolation have initially changed, and economic and cultural exchanges and personnel exchanges between the two sides have increased. This is the result of the joint efforts of the people on both sides. The Taiwan authorities have also taken some measures to ease the relationship between the two sides, but to this day, they still insist on the "three nos" (no compromise, no negotiation, no contact) stance of rejecting negotiations, and recently they have intensified the implementation of "flexible diplomacy," creating "two Chinas" and "one China, one Taiwan," which is contrary to the fundamental interests and wishes of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. We advocate "peaceful reunification" and "one country, two systems," and resolutely oppose any words and actions that may lead to Taiwan independence. We sincerely hope to discuss state affairs with the Taiwan authorities and people from all walks of life, and conduct contacts and consultations on the development of exchanges between the two sides and the issue of national reunification. We hope the Taiwan authorities will abandon the unreasonable "three nos" policy as soon as possible, remove man-made obstacles, and allow people from both sides to travel freely and equally, and conduct direct and open "three links" (mail, trade, and transport), and carry out various exchanges between the two sides in economics, culture, sports, science and technology, and academia. We warmly welcome Taiwanese businessmen to invest and set up factories in the mainland, engage in various industries, and achieve mutual benefits and development of the national economy. We believe that with the joint efforts of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, the relationship between the two sides will develop further, and the great cause of national reunification will definitely be realized.

Comrades!

The series of major events in the world in the past year have shown that the international situation is undergoing a turning point: from confrontation to dialogue, from tension to relaxation, a strong trend has formed worldwide. This is the result of the joint efforts of all countries in the world, reflecting the strong desire of the people of the world to maintain peace and seek development. Today, the prospect of world peace is more encouraging. However, the factors that cause international tension and turmoil have not been eliminated, and it still requires the unremitting efforts of the people of all countries in the world to strive for long-term stable peace.

China has always adhered to an independent and peaceful foreign policy, supporting the just cause of the people of the world, opposing hegemony, safeguarding world peace, and promoting common development. Based on this policy, we have actively carried out diplomatic work, extensively conducted international exchanges, increased cooperation between countries and friendship between peoples, and safeguarded China's national interests and state security, striving for a long-term peaceful international environment for China's modernization construction, while also making our own efforts for the relaxation of the international situation.

In the ten years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, the two countries have made significant progress in cooperation in many fields. The high-level contacts and dialogues maintained between China and the United States have played an important role in promoting the development of bilateral relations. Continuing to expand the economic, trade, and technological cooperation between China and the United States, and increasing friendly exchanges in various fields, is in the fundamental interests of both countries. We hope that the U.S. government will adhere to the principles of the three joint communiqués, adhere to the position of one China, and will not interfere in China's internal affairs in any way on any issue, so as not to cast a shadow that neither side wants to see on the existing friendly relations between China and the United States.

The normalization of Sino-Soviet relations is a major issue of concern to everyone. In recent years, the two sides have conducted many rounds of negotiations and consultations on the elimination of the three obstacles and the normalization of relations, and now substantial progress has been made, and a high-level meeting between China and the Soviet Union is about to be held. We believe that the Soviet Union can and should continue to make positive efforts in promoting the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia and pushing for a political solution to the Cambodian problem. After the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations, the two countries will develop friendly and neighborly relations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This is not only in the fundamental interests of the peoples of China and the Soviet Union but also conducive to peace and stability in Asia and the world, and will not harm the interests of any third country.

Maintaining good neighborly relations and friendly cooperation with neighboring countries in Asia is a consistent policy of the Chinese government. The traditional friendship between China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has been continuously strengthened. We are concerned about the peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula and support the reasonable proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for self-reliance and peaceful reunification. We hope that the dialogue and contact between the North and South of Korea will achieve positive results. China has no official relations with South Korea, but there are economic and trade exchanges between the two sides. The deep friendship between China and Pakistan and other South Asian countries has been further consolidated and developed in recent years. The recent improvement in relations between China and India has achieved positive results, which is conducive to the resolution of border issues through friendly consultations and the restoration and development of good-neighborly relations between the two countries. We share common views with Thailand and other ASEAN countries on the issue of maintaining peace in Southeast Asia, and we have maintained close consultations with them on the issue of a just and reasonable political solution to the Cambodian problem. China is willing to further develop friendly and cooperative relations with Southeast Asian countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We are pleased to see that the process of normalizing relations between China and Indonesia has begun recently, and we hope that the two countries will quickly restore friendly relations. The relationship between China and Laos has improved, and the two countries resumed the exchange of ambassadors last year. China and Mongolia have signed a treaty on border regulations and the handling of border issues, and the relationship between the two countries has developed.

The overall relationship between China and Japan is good, and economic and trade exchanges and scientific and technological and cultural exchanges between the two countries have developed significantly, but there are also some problems that need to be paid attention to and properly solved. In the past, Japanese militarists launched aggressive wars, bringing serious disasters to the people of China and other Asian countries. The nature of this war is unchangeable. Only by correctly treating history can we better create the future. We highly value the friendship between the two countries that has been cultivated through the long-term efforts of politicians and the people of the two countries, and hope that this friendship will be passed down from generation to generation. We hope that the friendly and neighborly relations between the two countries will develop steadily on the basis of the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between China and Japan.

The key to solving the Cambodian problem is the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia. Vietnam has stated that it will withdraw all its troops from Cambodia by no later than September this year, and it should keep its word and not leave troops in any form or under any pretext. For this, effective international supervision is needed. The international and domestic aspects of the Cambodian problem cannot be completely separated. As the direct party that caused the Cambodian problem, Vietnam is naturally responsible for achieving peace and national reconciliation in Cambodia. China supports the establishment of a provisional joint government headed by Prince Sihanouk, which will be conducive to achieving peace in Cambodia and avoiding civil war. Only when the Cambodian problem is solved can Sino-Vietnamese relations be normalized.

The withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan has been completed, which is welcome. We hope that the various political forces in Afghanistan will establish a broad-based coalition government through consultations as soon as possible, so that refugees can safely return home, the people can enjoy peace again, and the country can be rebuilt. The stabilization of the domestic situation in Afghanistan and the restoration of its independent, neutral, and non-aligned status will be conducive to peace and development in South Asia.

China and Eastern European countries are actively seeking a socialist construction path suitable for their own national conditions. We have a lot of experience to share and learn from each other in socialist construction. We are willing to continue to develop various aspects of relations with Eastern European countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

Strengthening friendly cooperation with Western European countries and Canada, Australia, and New Zealand is a long-term policy of China's diplomatic work. The European Community is an important trading partner of China. The economic and technological cooperation between China and Western European countries continues to develop steadily and has great potential to be tapped. We hope that both sides will make joint efforts to expand cooperation in broader fields.

Strengthening solidarity and cooperation with African countries is our unshakable policy. We will, as always, firmly support the efforts of African peoples to safeguard their national rights and revitalize their national economies. We are pleased to see that many African countries have shown a trend of improving relations and strengthening unity. We welcome the agreement reached by the relevant parties on the political settlement of the problem in Southwest Africa, hoping that Namibia can achieve independence smoothly, and Angola and Mozambique can restore peace as soon as possible, and the sovereignty and security of the frontline countries can be guaranteed. China has always strongly condemned racial discrimination and firmly supported the just struggle of the peoples of various African countries against the apartheid system in South Africa.

The friendly and cooperative relations between China and Arab countries have developed. Last year, China established diplomatic relations with Qatar and signed a memorandum of understanding with Saudi Arabia on the establishment of commercial representative offices. We are concerned about the peaceful settlement of the Middle East issue. The establishment of the State of Palestine and the recent flexible and realistic measures taken by the Palestine Liberation Organization have made new contributions to accelerating the Middle East peace process, which has been welcomed by the international community. We hope that the dialogue between the United States and the Palestine Liberation Organization will achieve substantive progress. The Israeli authorities should stop the suppression of the people in the occupied territories, follow the trend of the times, and make a positive response to the efforts of the relevant parties to seek Middle East peace. We advocate the convening of an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations to promote an early, fair, and reasonable political settlement of the Middle East issue.

We are pleased to see that Iran and Iraq have achieved a ceasefire, and we hope that their negotiations will lead to lasting peace between the two countries, so that the two peoples can rebuild their economies devastated by the war and build their own countries. We are pleased to see that the relationship between China and Latin American countries is developing smoothly. Last year, China signed multiple scientific and technological cooperation agreements with Argentina and Brazil, and bilateral cooperation has entered a new field, which is of great significance for promoting South-South cooperation. The friendly exchanges between China and some Latin American countries that have not yet established diplomatic relations have also increased. The prospects for China to develop friendly and cooperative relations with Latin American countries are very broad.

We have always attached importance to and supported the Non-Aligned Movement, hoping that it will play a greater role in the new international situation.

In recent years, the United Nations has played an increasingly important role in international affairs, especially in mediating and resolving regional conflicts and promoting the relaxation of the international situation. As a permanent member of the Security Council of the United Nations, China has actively participated in the activities of various fields of the United Nations. We are willing to work with all countries in the world to make the United Nations play a more active role in maintaining international peace and security and promoting development.

The relaxation trend that has emerged in the world after a long period of tension and turmoil is worth cherishing by the people. To promote the continued development of the international situation towards relaxation, the Chinese government proposes to establish a new international political order based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, namely, mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. These five principles have been tested by history and have strong vitality. Under this new order, countries, regardless of size or strength, are equal, respect each other, and no country imposes its will on others or seeks hegemony. The internal affairs of each country are handled by the country itself, and the common affairs of the world are handled through consultations by all countries. Countries with different social systems, different ideologies, and different levels of development coexist in friendship, and all international disputes are resolved through peaceful negotiations, not by resorting to force or threatening with force. We are convinced that such a world will be in line with the wishes of the peoples of all countries.

With the relaxation of the international situation, countries are paying more attention to development issues. Now many countries are carrying out reforms or adjustments, and economic and technological exchanges between countries are becoming increasingly close, which is in line with the trend of the times. A serious issue that the international community should pay attention to is that the debt burden of third world countries is becoming heavier, the gap between the South and the North is widening, and the strengthening of trade protectionism by developed countries is further aggravating the economic difficulties of developing countries. This unreasonable international economic order must be changed. Developed countries have the responsibility to help developing countries develop their economies and solve the debt problem through consultations. This is not only beneficial to developing countries but also, in the final analysis, beneficial to developed countries and conducive to the stability of the international situation. While actively carrying out South-South cooperation, China supports the promotion of South-North cooperation through dialogue, advocates the establishment of a new international economic order on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and is conducive to the common prosperity of all countries.

The Chinese government will continue to implement an independent and peaceful foreign policy and put the strengthening of economic and technological cooperation with various countries in a more important position. We will be more active and flexible in carrying out foreign work, further expanding friendly exchanges with countries around the world, and working with countries around the world to promote the continued development of the international situation in a direction conducive to peace and development.

Comrades!

Overall, the current domestic and international situation is favorable for China's construction and reform. The difficulties we face in domestic economic construction are problems of progress and development. As long as we unite as one, pool our wisdom, and work together, we will definitely be able to overcome difficulties and achieve the expected goals in the rectification and order and deepening of reform. We must work together to achieve outstanding results to welcome the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and continue to advance the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics!

    坚决贯彻治理整顿和深化改革的方针
    ——1989年3月20日在第七届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上的政府工作报告
    国务院总理　李鹏各位代表：
    治理经济环境和整顿经济秩序，是今明两年我国建设和改革的重点，也是政府工作的重点。因此，我代表国务院，主要就这个问题向大会作政府工作报告，请予审议。
    一、一心一意进行治理整顿
    1988年是我国实行改革开放的第十年。十年来，我国各个方面都发生了巨大的历史性变化，社会生产力有了很大的发展，国家经济实力显著增强，城乡人民生活明显改善。实践证明中国共产党十一届三中全会以来的路线是正确的。刚刚过去的1988年，是我国社会主义现代化事业继续向前发展的一年。
    国民经济持续增长。全年国民生产总值达到13853亿元，按可比价格计算比上年增长11.2％，国民收入达到11533亿元，按可比价格计算比上年增长11.4％。在全国自然灾害频繁的情况下，粮食减产2.2％，棉花减产1.1％，但其他许多农产品和多种经营进一步发展，整个农业总产值仍然增长3.2％。广大农民积极交售粮食，支援国家建设，全国粮食收购任务已基本完成。工业生产、交通运输和邮电事业持续发展。钢、煤、电、石油等产量有较大增长，市场紧俏的日用工业品和农用工业品增长更快。工业企业全员劳动生产率比上年提高9.3％，每万元工业产值的能源和电力消耗分别比上年下降5.63％和5.75％。在生产增长的基础上，城乡多数人的生活继续有所改善。
  重点建设取得新成就。全国建成投产大中型基本建设项目78个，大中型项目中的重要单项工程138个。一批重点电站、煤矿、铁路和港口建成投产，为现代化建设增添了后续力量。全国新增的主要生产能力有：发电装机容量999万千瓦，原煤开采3090万吨，原油开采1577万吨，乙烯60万吨，水泥246万吨，平板玻璃792万重量箱，铁路交付营业里程419公里，铁路复线里程820公里，铁路电气化里程1487公里，沿海港口吞吐能力878万吨。
    经济体制改革继续深入。企业承包经营责任制逐步改善，企业活力进一步增强。许多企业经过优化劳动组合，提高了劳动生产率。商品、资金、技术、劳务和外汇调剂等市场有了新的发展。在宏观调控方面，逐步进行了计划、投资、物资、金融、外贸等方面的体制改革，初步加强了财政、税收、银行、物价、审计、海关、工商行政等方面的管理。
    对外开放进一步扩大。进出口总额突破1000亿美元，比上年增长24.4％，工业制成品的出口比重有了提高。实际利用外资98.4亿美元，比上年增长16.4％。新批准外商投资企业5940家，是十年来最多的一年。对外承包工程和劳务合作完成营业额近13亿美元。国际旅游业创汇22.2亿美元，比上年有较多的增加。
  在经济发展的基础上，科技、教育、文化、卫生和体育等事业取得了新的成就。核潜艇水下发射运载火箭试验圆满成功，北京正负电子对撞机对撞成功，说明我国在高技术领域的若干方面取得了显著进展。社会主义民主和社会主义法制建设得到加强。国务院的机构改革，已按七届人大一次会议批准的方案基本完成。公安、安全、司法等部门为维护社会治安做了大量工作。人民军队在保卫祖国和支持社会主义现代化建设中，在抢险救灾中，发挥了巨大的作用，作出了卓越的贡献。
    我们在各项工作取得成绩的同时，面临的问题和困难也不少，最突出的是出现了明显的通货膨胀，物价上涨幅度过大，全国零售物价总指数比1987年上升18.5％，物价上涨幅度这么大，超越了群众、企业和国家的承受能力，相当一部分城市居民的实际生活水平有所下降。这些情况引起了社会的普遍关注和群众的严重不安，影响了社会的安定和群众对改革的信心。如果不采取坚决措施遏制通货膨胀，不仅经济无法稳定和发展，各项改革也无法深入下去。
    通货膨胀的加剧，是经济过热、投资需求和消费需求双膨胀、社会总需求超过总供给的结果。全国在建的固定资产投资项目过多，规模过大，超过了国力承担的可能；消费需求过旺，社会购买力的增长超过了商品供应量的增长；国家财政支大于收，信贷规模过大，货币发行过多。在供求总量不平衡的同时，经济结构失调，农业发展滞后，有限资源过多地投入加工工业和非生产性建设，在工业生产高速增长的情况下加剧了能源、原材料和运输能力的紧张程度。一些单位和个人为谋取私利，非法倒买倒卖，层层盘剥，制造和出售伪劣商品，更推动了物价上涨，加剧了经济秩序的混乱。
    上述情况的产生，是同新旧体制转换时期还不可能很快形成一套自我调节、自我约束的新机制分不开的。但与此同时，我们在对工作的指导上也有缺点和失误。总的来看，在经济建设中，存在着急于求成的倾向。我们的国家是发展中国家，需要有一定的经济增长速度，但往往忽视国家人口众多、资源相对短缺、经济发展很不平衡的实际情况，在指导上对盲目扩大建设规模、片面追求产值产量、攀比发展速度等现象注意防止不够，纠正不力。改革的方向是正确的，总体上是成功的，但我们在指导上往往对改革的艰巨性和复杂性认识不足，注意综合配套不够，在坚持放权搞活的过程中，未能及时加强管理监督和抓紧建立宏观调控体系。我们在去年初制定了稳定经济、深化改革的方针，但由于后来对1987年经济形势的估价过于乐观，因此在执行中没有坚持把稳定经济放在首位，行动不坚决，措施不得力。我们认识到了价格改革在整个经济体制改革中的重要地位，但在实际工作中对国家、企业和群众的承受能力考虑不够，在通货膨胀已经比较明显的情况下没有及时采取稳定金融、控制物价的有力措施，又放开、调整了一些商品价格，以致加剧了群众对物价上涨的恐慌心理，在许多地方诱发了抢购商品和储蓄下降。
    中国共产党于去年9月召开的十三届三中全会，正确地分析了我国的经济形势，提出了治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革的方针，确定了今明两年要把建设和改革的重点放到治理整顿上来的部署。为了贯彻落实这样的方针和部署，必须把稳定、改革和发展统一起来，在稳定中推进改革和求得发展。从今年起，我们要用两年或者更长一些的时间，努力实现治理整顿所要达到的目标：（一）消除经济过热，把发展速度降到比较合理的水平。（二）遏制通货膨胀，使1989年物价上涨幅度明显低于1988年，1990年以后的上涨幅度进一步下降。（三）压缩固定资产投资规模，使它同国力承担的可能相适应；控制消费基金的过快增长，使它同国民收入的增长相适应。（四）逐步缓解社会总需求大于总供给的矛盾，实现财政、信贷、物资、外汇的基本平衡。（五）认真调整经济结构，使粮、棉、油等主要农产品的产量有较多增加，使能源、交通、原材料供应的紧张状况有所缓和。（六）建立健全必要的经济法规以及宏观调控体系和监督体系，积极推进社会主义商品经济新秩序的建设。只有实现这些目标，才能使我国经济的素质和效益明显提高，保证国民经济的长期稳定发展。
    中共十三届三中全会以后的半年来，国务院和各级政府为治理经济环境和整顿经济秩序，做了大量的工作，取得了初步成效。
    ——大力压缩固定资产投资规模。截至今年2月底，全国已经停建缓建固定资产投资项目18000个，可压缩今后几年的投资647亿元，占全部项目剩余工作量的12％。但是，清理、压缩的目标尚未达到，任务还十分艰巨。
    ——控制信贷规模、增加储蓄和稳定金融。由于实行了紧缩金融的方针，信贷规模得到控制。银行两次提高储蓄利率和开展保值、有奖储蓄，发挥经济杠杆的作用，全国城乡居民储蓄存款逐步回升。现在，一方面全国货币发行量仍然过大；另一方面不少地方和企业又感到资金紧缺，这需要在坚持紧缩金融的前提下通过调整信贷结构等措施认真加以解决。
    ——压缩社会集团购买力。专项控制商品由19种扩大到32种，去年的零售额比上年下降9.1％。县以上单位去年的集团消费比上年增长1.8％。利用公款吃喝、请客、送礼、旅游等现象，在党政机关有所减少。但各方面的铺张浪费仍很严重，必须继续抓紧解决。
    ——开展了全国性的财务、税收、物价大检查，共查出应上交财政的违纪金额74.1亿元，已上交56.5亿元。通过检查，处理了一批偷税漏税、截留利润、乱涨价乱收费和贪污受贿、监守自盗等违法案件，初步加强了税收、财务和物价管理。
    ——整顿流通领域的秩序。各类公司的清理整顿正在抓紧进行，重点清查了1986年以来新成立的公司和流通领域的公司。截至今年1月底，已撤并不具备条件和不该办的公司17092个；在党政机关办的24187个公司中，已有近两万个撤并或同机关脱钩，约占80％。在公司兼职、任职的党政机关在职干部和离退休干部4万多人中，已有70％以上辞去公司职务或机关职务，或已按规定办理了相应手续。党政机关经商办企业的现象，已基本得到制止。在清理中查处了一批违法违纪案件，其中包括一些大案要案。清理整顿公司的工作，还要继续深入进行下去。对一些重要产品和紧俏商品加强了管理，有的实行了专营，使抬价抢购和非法倒卖行为有所收敛，对建立市场秩序和稳定物价起了积极作用。
    ——努力增加有效供给。在压缩社会总需求的同时，从资金、物资、外汇和运输等各个方面，大力支持粮、棉、油、肉、禽、蛋、蔬菜等农副产品的生产，支持人民生活必需的日用工业品的生产，支持市场紧俏商品和出口创汇产品的生产，基本上保证了国内市场的供应和发展对外贸易的需要。今年元旦和春节的节日市场，货源比较充足，商品比较丰富。
    经过半年来的工作，经济过热开始降温，物价上涨势头有所减弱，群众对物价的紧张心理有所缓和，城乡市场基本稳定。
    我们认为，对半年来的治理整顿，应该作两点基本估计：第一，事实证明，中共中央、国务院确定的治理整顿的方针政策和措施是正确的。只要毫不动摇地坚持执行这些方针政策和措施，并及时研究新的情况，解决新的问题，就一定能够克服前进道路上的困难。第二，已经取得的成效仅仅是初步的，同治理整顿所要达到的目标还有很大的差距。现在还有不少同志对治理整顿的必要性和艰巨性认识不足。治理整顿本身的难度很大，还会在某些方面带来一些新的困难，但如果不坚持治理整顿，各方面的困难会更大。我们只能知难而进，决不能半途而废。
    为了坚定不移地搞好治理整顿，必须在思想认识上进一步解决好以下三个问题。一是，各级政府、政府工作人员特别是负责工作人员，必须坚决维护中共中央的领导权威，坚决维护国务院对政府工作的领导权威，坚决维护法纪政纪的权威，切实做到有令则行，有禁则止。历史的经验反复证明，调整经济，克服困难，没有必要的集中统一，没有严格的组织纪律，是根本不可能的。二是，进行治理整顿，必然要对现有的利益格局进行必要的调整。一切地方、部门和单位，都要顾全大局，牢固树立局部利益服从全局利益的观念。如果不是这样，大家都不放弃有碍全局的既得利益，治理整顿就会成为纸上谈兵。三是，在治理整顿期间，政府和人民都要有过几年紧日子的思想准备。从国务院开始，各级政府和各部门，广大干部特别是领导干部，要带头勤俭节约，艰苦奋斗，坚决克服铺张浪费现象。只要我们以身作则，并把要过紧日子的客观要求向群众说清楚，相信广大人民是会理解和支持的。总之，国务院要求各级政府和各部门的负责人进一步提高认识，把思想、行动统一到中共中央、国务院的方针政策上来，同心同德，团结群众，一心一意狠抓治理整顿，为稳定经济、深化改革进行坚持不懈的努力。
    二、当前治理整顿的重点仍然是压缩社会需求
    我国近年来的通货膨胀，主要是由经济过热、需求过旺引发的。治理经济环境和整顿经济秩序，当然需要从压缩社会需求和增加社会供给两方面作出努力，但首先必须毫不动摇地把过大的社会总需求压缩下来。
    压缩固定资产投资规模，是对压缩社会总需求具有决定性影响的重大措施，是抑制通货膨胀、稳定经济全局的首要任务。国务院已经决定：今年全社会固定资产投资规模要比上年压缩920亿元，减少21％；其中，全民所有制单位投资规模压缩510亿元，减少19％。目前各地虽然在这方面已经做了许多工作，但同上述要求还有不小差距，而且进展很不平衡，必须下大决心坚持不懈地抓下去。
    压缩和控制固定资产投资规模，关键是清理在建项目。只有坚决砍掉一大批在建项目，投资规模才能真正缩减下来。不仅要砍掉一大批楼堂馆所和非生产性建设项目，还要停建缓建一批生产性的建设项目；不仅那些不该上的项目要坚决压下来，就是一些该上的项目，也要根据财力物力和其它条件的可能，区别轻重缓急，合理安排。各部门各地方必须按照国务院颁布的产业政策和清理在建项目目录，对号入座，认真清理，该停建缓建的坚决停建缓建，决不允许弄虚作假。必须加强对全社会固定资产投资活动的宏观调控，运用经济的、法律的和必要的行政手段，既管理好国家计划安排的投资活动，又特别重视严格控制计划外、预算外的投资活动。对银行投资贷款实行指令性计划管理，禁止非银行金融机构从事投资信贷活动，坚决限制通过社会集资扩大固定资产投资规模。在治理整顿期间，必须切实控制新开工项目，凡是没有按规定报经批准的，一律不得开工；擅自开工的，必须严格追究建设单位及其主管部门的责任。一定要采取有效措施，坚决维护国家计划和政策的严肃性，使那些违背国家计划、政策的地方和单位受到应有的经济和行政的处罚。
    在治理整顿中，还必须坚决控制消费需求的过快增长。控制消费需求的重点：一是坚决压缩和控制社会集团消费。今年的全国社会集团购买力，要在1988年水平的基础上压缩20％。二是严格控制工资总额的增长，坚决制止滥发奖金、实物和擅自扩大津贴、补贴的发放范围。加强对工资基金的管理，整顿和改进企业特别是各类公司工资、奖金的发放办法，整顿和加强企业自有资金的管理和监督，严格按国家规定征收奖金税和工资调节税。三是大力提倡和鼓励人民储蓄，并采取多种办法正确引导消费，吸收和推迟实现社会购买力。增加城乡居民储蓄，既有需要又有可能，既利国又利民，应当通过广泛深入的宣传教育，采取各种有效的便于人民储蓄的措施，把储蓄活动普遍开展起来。所有的宏观经济管理部门和监督部门，都要切实负起责任来，加强对消费需求的控制和监督。无论是国家、企业还是个人，都要进一步树立在发展生产的基础上改善生活的观念，自觉抑制过高的消费欲望，反对各种铺张浪费，发扬勤俭节约、艰苦奋斗的优良传统。
    在压缩社会总需求的同时，还必须努力改善和增加有效供给，以缓解市场供求矛盾，保障人民生活和国家建设的需要。这里所说的有效供给，主要是粮棉油肉禽蛋蔬菜等重要农副产品、人民生活必需的日用工业品、适销对路的轻纺产品和农用工业品、回笼货币多的紧俏产品和出口创汇产品，以及生产和生活都离不开的交通、能源和短缺原材料，而不是不加区别地要求增加所有产品的生产。改善和增加有效供给的关键，在于大力应用和推广先进的科技成果和管理方法，充分挖掘现有企业的潜力，降低物质消耗，改善产品质量，提高劳动生产率，提高资金使用效益。各行各业都要深入持久、扎扎实实地开展增产节约、增收节支运动，真正走提高经济效益来发展社会生产的路子。
    国务院已经决定，在建国四十周年的时候，召开全国劳动模范表彰大会，鼓励先进，总结经验，促进“双增双节”运动深入发展，进一步推动我国的改革和建设事业。
    同压缩社会总需求相适应，金融和财政都必须实行紧缩的方针政策，继续抽紧银根，严格控制货币发行。国民经济计划和国家预算经全国人民代表大会审议通过后，国务院各部门和各级政府要坚决贯彻执行。要千方百计稳定金融，切实加强对银行各种贷款的计划管理，控制全社会的信用总规模，尤其要加强对非银行金融机构和各种集资活动的管理和监督。在紧缩资金供应总量的前提下，合理调整信贷结构，该保的保，该压的压，做到紧中有活。必须坚持财政收支基本平衡的原则，逐步
  减少财政赤字。各地方、各部门都应当厉行节约，压缩开支，同时努力开辟新的财源。
    三、认真整顿经济秩序特别是流通秩序
    经过这些年的改革开放，企业活力增强，市场不断扩大，有力地促进了生产力的发展，但在新旧体制转换中矛盾和漏洞很多，加上法制建设和宏观调控体系不健全，在生产、建设、流通等领域都出现了一些混乱现象，特别是流通秩序的混乱相当严重。为了保证建设和改革的健康发展，必须认真整顿经济秩序特别是流通秩序，坚决推进社会主义商品经济新秩序的建设。
    整顿经济秩序特别是流通秩序，首先必须继续清理整顿各类公司。在这个问题上，国务院各有关部门必须带头做好工作。清理整顿的重点，是解决一些公司政企不分、官商不分、非法倒卖、牟取暴利的问题。各类公司在财务、物资、工资等方面，必须与党政机关脱钩，建立健全各项财务制度，改变目前在这些方面的混乱状况。各部门各地方都要把清理、整顿公司的情况和结果公布于众，接受群众的评议和监督。要把清理整顿工作同经常性的监督管理结合起来，工商行政管理机关要加强年度检查，严格审定各类公司的经营资格、经营范围和经营方式。组建新公司，必须严格执行审批程序，防止出现一边清理、一边膨胀的现象。
    为了确保今年的物价上涨幅度明显低于去年，必须切实加强物价和市场管理，严格财经纪律。国务院管理的生产资料、生活资料的价格和各项收费，任何部门、地方和企业都不得擅自提价和提高收费标准。各级地方政府管理的价格和收费，要按照国务院的规定，严格控制。对国务院规定的重要农副产品、工业消费品和某些计划外生产资料的最高限价，必须严格执行。大中城市要列出一些主要副食品和其他人民生活必需品的商品目录，采取扶持生产、财政补贴等综合性措施，保证这些商品的市场供应，保持价格的基本稳定。各级政府要加强对放开价格的指导和监督。对比较重要的商品，要认真执行企业提价申报制度，规定合理的地区、进销、批零价格差率，减少流通环节，制止中间盘剥，制止通过易地涨价来转嫁负担的行为。继续培育各类商品和物资的交易市场，严格市场交易规则，促使交易活动公开化、票据化。要充分重视和发挥国营物资企业、商业企业吞吐调剂、稳定市场、平抑物价的作用。加强对各类企业以及个体工商户的税收征管工作。强化工商行政、物价、税务、统计、计量、技术监督、卫生检疫等管理部门对各类市场的检查和监督，发挥各自职能，密切分工协作。提倡公平交易，明码实价，制止不正当竞争和地下交易。充分发挥消费者协会和群众物价检查员的作用，采取设立举报中心等多种形式，鼓励广大群众参与市场监督。坚决打击和取缔欺行霸市、投机倒把、哄抬物价等非法行为。各类企业都要严格执行国家的各项财务、税收、物价政策，依法经营，依法纳税。对于偷税、漏税、抗税以及从事其他非法经营活动的单位或个人，应当依法给予制裁，触犯刑律的要追究刑事责任。
      认真整顿和改进重要商品的流通方式。对重要的生产资料，除实行专营的以外，都应当按规定进入市场，进行公开交易。对于重要生产资料、紧俏耐用消费品等国家明文规定的专营商品，非国家政策允许的单位、个人一律不得经营。专营部门要
  严格执行国家规定的专营办法和价格政策，处处为用户和群众着想，坚决防止利用垄断地位谋取私利。任何单位和个人都不得钻价格双轨制的空子，非法倒卖计划内的商品和物资，从中牟取暴利。对于粮食、棉花、蚕丝、生猪等紧缺的农副产品，既要防止地区之间相互封锁，又要防止地区之间抬价抢购，尽量通过经济办法建立比较稳定的协作关系，积极发展多种形式的区域性经济合作，合理解决地区之间的利益分配关系。
    四、在治理整顿中认真调整经济结构
    只有在治理整顿中切实抓好经济结构的调整，才能防止出现经济滞胀现象，在优化结构的基础上提高国民经济的素质和效益，保证和促进我国经济的长期稳定发展。当前调整结构的基本方向和任务，是集中力量发展农业、能源、交通和原材料等基础产业，加强能够增加有效供给的产业和产品，增强经济发展的后劲；同时控制加工工业的发展规模和速度，使它们同基础产业的发展相协调。
    第一、切实加强农业在国民经济中的基础地位，争取今年农业特别是粮食棉花油料生产有个好收成。
    农业是当前国民经济中突出的薄弱环节。切实加强农业的基础地位，争取今年粮食、棉花、油料等主要农产品有个好收成，并且保持其他作物和林牧渔业稳定发展，对于抑制物价上涨、稳定经济全局具有特别重要的意义。发展农业，一要靠执行稳定的农村政策和深化改革，二要靠推广和发展先进的农业科学技术，三要靠增加农业投入，增强农业发展后劲。
    为了调动农民增产粮食和棉花的积极性，国务院决定：从今年4月1日起，将合同定购粮食的收购价格平均提高18％；继续完善合同定购粮食与平价化肥、柴油和预购定金“三挂钩”的政策，适当增加挂钩化肥的供应数量；合同定购以外的粮食实行市场交易，价格随行就市。同时，在新棉上市时适当提高棉花收购价格。
    为了增加对农业的资金投入，在今年紧缩财政、金融的情况下，国务院仍然决定，中央财政对农业包括林业、水利的投入不仅不减少，还要有所增加。地方政府和其它方面要把更多的财力用于增加农业投入。为了稳定增加农业投入，从今年开始将从多种渠道筹集和建立农业发展基金。其中包括：从预算外资金中提取一部分，从乡镇企业税收、耕地占用税、农林特产税、农村个体工商户和私营企业税收中提取全部或一部分，从国外贷款中划出一定比例，用于发展农业，这就为农业发展资金开辟了稳定增长的来源。与此同时，农业银行、信用社计划今年增加农业贷款172亿元，同时调整原有近800亿元农业贷款的结构，支持国家和地方的商品粮、棉、糖等生产基地建设，支持农业资源开发和农业基础设施的配套建设，支持搞好“菜篮子”工程，重点发展肉类、禽类、水产和蔬菜等副食品生产。要继续做好扶贫工作，帮助贫困地区脱贫致富。积极鼓励和引导农民把更多的资金投入农业生产和开发，这是增加农业投入的主渠道。为保证农民把有限的资金用于生产，对一些地方乱摊派、乱收费的现象要严加制止。坚决打击坑农、害农的违法经营活动。各行各业都要支援农业。国务院各有关部门和各地人民政府对化肥、农药、农膜等生产所需的能源、原材料要优先保证供应。充分发挥和努力扩大现有的化肥生产能力，坚决完成今年的化肥生产和供应任务。同时鼓励广大农民积极增施农家肥，改善土壤结构。为了保证农业丰收，必须十分重视搞好农田基本建设和水利建设，加强江河治理，提高抗灾能力，尤其要确保大江大河防汛安全。
    以家庭经营为主的联产承包责任制，符合目前我国大多数地区农业生产力的发展水平，仍然具有旺盛的生命力，应当保持稳定并不断完善。提倡建立多层次、多形式的农村社会化的生产服务体系，并使之逐步相互配套，促进农村商品经济的发展。在少数确实具备条件的地方，在群众自愿的前提下，可以有步骤地实行适度规模经营，以进一步提高农业劳动生产率。开发性农业要尽可能实行规模经营。
    发展乡镇企业，对于支持农业生产，增加农民收入，拓宽农村剩余劳动力的就业门路，促进国民经济发展，具有重要作用和深远意义。乡镇企业要根据国家的宏观要求和市场需要，在治理整顿期间适当降低发展速度，切实整顿和认真改进经营作风，调整产品结构，提高产品质量，降低物质消耗，提高劳动生产率，积极防治污染。乡镇工业应当主要发展农副产品加工、某些原材料生产和为城市工业配套的生产，发展出口创汇产品的生产。乡镇企业所需的资金，应当主要依靠自身积累。
    第二、努力加强能源、交通、通信和重要原材料等基础工业和基础设施的建设，逐步缓解当前这些方面的紧张状况。
    在大力压缩固定资产投资规模的同时，必须采取有力措施，支持能源、交通、通信和重要原材料产业的建设。这些产业的开发与建设，也必须坚持保证重点、扶持先进、讲究效益、区别对待的原则，不能齐头并进，以便使有限的财力物力发挥出更大的作用。
    解决能源问题要坚持开发与节约并重的方针。煤炭工业要加强统配煤矿的建设，继续扶持、引导地方煤矿健康发展。当前特别要迅速采取有力措施，帮助统配煤矿摆脱经济困境，改变乡镇煤矿生产停滞和下降的不正常状况。石油工业在努力寻找新的储量和不断开发新油田的同时，要在老油田上打攻坚战，保持原油产量的稳定增长。电力工业建设要坚持大家办电的方针，因地制宜发展火电、水电，开发核电，努力增加电力生产能力，坚持按计划发电供电。与此同时，进一步抓好节约能源的工作。要普遍推广和采用节能型技术，广泛推行节约承包，在所有机关、团体、企事业单位和居民中大力提倡节约用电、用水、用油、用煤。对重点耗能单位和设备，实行严格的监测和检查制度。对那些能耗高、效率低、污染大的小电石、小铁合金、小高炉、小电炉、小电解铝、土炼油厂等，要严格控制生产和建设。在原材料工业方面，钢铁工业要在发展中积极调整产品结构，提高质量，增加短缺品种，提高成材率，降低消耗，大力增进经济效益。有色金属、化工原料工业、森林工业也要认真调整产品结构，在调整中适当发展。加强地质勘查工作，为发展能源和原材料工业提供矿物资源。所有的地方、部门和企业，都要把原材料的节约和综合利用，当作提高经济效益的一件大事抓紧抓好。
    交通运输的紧张状况，已经成为当前我国经济和社会生活中的突出问题，必须把发展交通运输放在更为重要的地位。积极发展以铁路为重点的综合交通运输体系，努力提高运输系统的综合效率。铁路建设要以增强晋煤外运能力和某些限制口的通过能力为重点，在加强新线建设和旧线技术改造的同时，进一步挖掘现有设施的潜力。公路要加强主干线建设，提高干线公路通行能力。加强港口码头的建设，充分发挥水路运输的作用。继续加强民用航空的建设。合理组织运输，切实改进管理。严格交通安全监督与检查制度，防止恶性事故的发生。继续加快邮电通信业的发展。
    第三、严格控制加工工业发展的规模和速度，使它们同农业、能源、原材料和运输能力的增长相适应。
    近几年，加工工业特别是一般加工工业发展过快，盲目生产和重复建设相当严重，许多产品质量差，物质消耗高。这种状况，不仅造成农产品、能源、原材料和交通运输全面紧张，而且严重影响生产要素的有效使用和合理配置。努力改变这种状况，既是当前调整经济结构的重要环节，也是提高社会经济效益的关键所在。调整加工工业结构的原则和要求是，压缩和控制长线产品，增加和开发短线产品，注重提高产品质量，全面加强经营管理，使加工工业在提高素质上取得较大的进展。
    在轻纺工业方面，要严格限制和淘汰一批市场滞销和质量低劣的产品，控制大量消耗粮食、能源和紧缺原材料的产品，努力增加名牌优质产品和市场紧缺的产品。要根据城乡居民不  同层次的需求和购买力水平，开发适销对路的新产品和新品种，特别要大力增产适应农村需要的日用消费品。
    在机械电子工业方面，对于供过于求的，性能低下的，以及耗电高的产品，要严格限制生产；已经明令公布淘汰的产品，要禁止生产。与此同时，努力研制和开发能源、原材料、交通运输和通信等基础产业所需要的机电成套装备及其基础元器件，增产适用的农业机械和其它农用工具。积极吸收和消化引进的技术，大力增加能够替代进口的产品生产，提高机电产品的国产化水平。
    围绕着上述产业结构的调整，还需要相应地合理调整企业组织结构、地区经济布局和消费结构，在投资、信贷、财政、税收、价格等方面实行重点倾斜和扶优限劣的政策，对那些需要加强和鼓励的方面，真正加以支持；对那些需要控制和禁止的方面，切实加以限制，大力促进整个经济结构的合理化和资源的优化配置。为此，国务院颁布了《关于当前产业政策要点的决定》，各地方、各部门应当认真贯彻执行，并在实践中不断加以充实、改进和完善。
    五、在治理整顿中确保科技和教育的发展
    科学技术的发展和进步，是实现我国经济振兴的真正希望所在。在国民经济的治理、整顿和调整中，必须把推动工农业生产特别是重点产业的技术进步作为重要目标，依靠科学技术和科学管理实现产业结构的优化和提高经济效益。为保证科技事业的发展，今年各级政府要继续增加科技经费，并在调整投资、信贷结构时实行有利于科技进步的政策。企业和农村也要千方百计加强对技术开发活动的投入。当前，科技工作要面向经济建设的主战场，抓紧第七个五年计划期间国家科技攻关计划、技术改造计划以及“星火”、“丰收”计划的组织实施，积极推广有普遍实用价值的科技成果。技术进步的有关指标应当纳入到企业承包经营的指标体系中去。大中型企业要努力增强技术开发能力，小型企业包括乡镇企业也要有自己的技术依托。农村要建立健全农业技术推广和服务体系。为增强国力和支持经济、社会的未来发展，有步骤有重点地研究和开发高技术。通过实施“火炬”计划等措施，促进高技术成果的商品化和产业化。同时，重视与支持基础研究和应用基础研究工作。近几年，科技体制改革取得了明显的进展。要进一步做好改革的配套和完善工作，促进科技同经济密切结合机制的形成。充实和健全科研基金制度，充分发挥专利制度的作用，培育和发展技术市场，大力促进科技单位与企业的多种形式的联合和协作，动员和组织广大科技人员为经济建设不断作出贡献。
    从根本上说，推动科技进步和提高经济效益，乃至整个社会主义现代化目标的实现，都取决于劳动者素质的提高和专门人才的培养。近年来我国教育事业发展较快，涌现出一批重视教育并取得显著成绩的地区和部门。但从总体上看，我国教育事业是落后的，教育发展和改革还不适应社会主义建设的需要。七届人大一次会议以后，国务院组织国家教委等有关部门就教育工作中的一系列重大问题进行了广泛深入的研讨。国务院将继续听取各方面的意见，抓紧制订到本世纪末我国教育发展和改革纲要。各级政府、各部门和各行各业都要进一步提高对教育的认识，高度重视教育的长期重要战略地位，并且在治理整顿期间努力保证教育事业的发展。1989年，在紧缩各方面财政开支的情况下，国务院决定对教育经费不仅不减少，而且有较大幅度的增加。政府的教育经费将达到374亿元，比去年增加50亿元，增长15.4％。此外，城乡教育费附加等预算外教育经费，也将有较多增加。当然，这同教育发展的实际需要还有较大差距，国务院和各级政府要在执行预算中通过增收节支尽可能增加教育经费。从长远看，解决教育经费不足的问题，只靠增加政府财政拨款是不够的。必须通过改革，使教育事业成为全民的事业、全民的责任，增加全社会对教育的投入。在继续增加政府财政拨款并明确各级政府财政所必须负担的教育经费比例的同时，要积极改革办学体制，发展社会力量办学，开辟筹措教育经费的新渠道，并切实加强对教育经费使用的管理和审计监督，杜绝挪用、浪费现象。近些年，一些地方积极采取各种措施调动社会各方面和人民群众发展教育的积极性，促进了教育事业的发展。实践证明，教育关系到人民的切身利益，社会上蕴藏着很大的发展教育的积极性。只要各级领导重  视，认真总结这些新鲜经验，不断加以完善，完全有可能逐步增加教育经费在国民生产总值中的比重。
    发展教育事业，要从我国的实际情况出发，合理规划发展的速度、规模和重点，确定适当的结构层次比例，不断提高教育的投资效益和社会效益。由于各地经济文化基础差异较大，发展教育要在加重地方政府责任的同时，赋予地方政府更大的统筹权和决策权，使他们能够根据当地的情况来决定教育工作的重大问题。要努力适应社会主义建设的需要，进一步调整教育结构，搞好教育改革，把不断提高教育的普及程度同发展职业技术教育密切结合起来，使教育更好地为提高劳动者素质服务。各级政府要认真贯彻《义务教育法》，按照积极坚定、保证质量、分区规划、因地制宜的原则，进一步修订好实施义务教育的规划并建立目标责任制，推进义务教育的实施。为广大农村培养中、初级科技人才和提高农村劳动者素质的“燎原计划”，是进行农村教育综合改革，促进农村发展的一项具有深远意义的社会工程。各地要抓紧安排实施，努力做出成绩。城市要探讨企业和学校结合发展职业技术教育的办法，进一步贯彻执行“先培训、后就业”的原则，积极进行中等专业和技术教育的改革。要稳定高等教育发展的总规模，把工作重点放到提高教育质量上来。认真做好高等教育的综合改革试验，进一步调整科系结构，增强专业的适应性，完善供需见面、双向选择的毕业分配制度。高等学校开展多种形式的社会服务，目的在于密切学校同社会的联系，提高教育和科研的社会效益，要坚持由学校统一组织安排，健全和完善有关制度。成人教育要以加强对在职职工的培训为重点，并采取有力措施，制定具体规划和目标，抓紧扫盲工作。注意把社会力量办学的积极性引导到支持发展基础教育和职业技术教育的方向上来。要进一步活跃教育学术空气，加强教育科学和理论的研究，积极探索教育思想、教育内容和教育方法的改革，不断提高教育质量。
    教育的发展和改革，必须坚决依靠和充分发挥广大教师的积极性和创造性，努力培养一支素质优良的教师队伍。要有计划、有步骤地加强教师培训工作，扩大教师的来源和培养途径。要继续采取措施，改善教师的工作条件和生活条件。同时，要深入进行学校内部管理体制的改革，优化教师队伍，不断提高广大教师的思想和业务素质。
    学校的根本任务是育人。各级各类学校都要把改进和加强思想品德和政治教育放到重要位置，并切实抓好校风、校纪建设。对当前少数学校中存在的乱收费、滥发文凭、师生经商、教学纪律松弛等某些混乱现象，以及一些地方出现的中小学生辍学、弃学问题，各级政府和教育部门必须高度重视，采取有力措施予以纠正，努力造就良好的教书育人环境。
    六、把治理整顿同深化改革密切结合起来
    治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序，是在坚持改革总方向的前提下进行的。我们决不会回到过度集中、管得过多过细过死的旧的经济模式上去，更不会走否定社会主义制度的私有化道路。当前我们采取的许多治理整顿措施，本身就是深化改革的重要内容。搞好治理整顿，也离不开深化改革。强调治理和整顿，决不意味着改革可以停顿不前。治理和整顿搞好了，就可以在宏观上为深化改革创造比较好的环境，更好地促进社会主义有计划商品经济的发展。    1989年的经济体制改革要着重完善和发展已经出台的各项改革措施，同时配合治理整顿，进行新的改革探索。重点是继续完善和发展工商企业承包经营责任制，积极探索加强和改善宏观经济调控的措施和方法，培育有秩序的市场，缓解分配不公的矛盾。各项改革必须紧紧围绕治理整顿这个中心，做到有利于压缩需求，调整结构，有利于增加有效供给，提高经济效益。
    为了完善和发展企业的承包经营责任制，要抓好大中型企业的招标承包，尽量做到规范化、制度化，减少行政干预。积极推行全员风险抵押承包，促使经营者和职工的利益、风险与企业的经营状况密切联系在一起，调动经营者和职工的积极性，增强企业自我约束的能力和对市场变化的适应能力。继续推行并完善企业工资总额与实现利税、上交利税、提高劳动生产率、降低原材料消耗等多个指标挂钩的形式和办法，防止单纯靠产品涨价增加企业利益。认真贯彻执行《企业法》和《破产法》，继续推行厂长负责制，理顺企业内部的领导关系。企业有权根据自己的情况决定机构设置，上级有关部门不要强求上下对口。通过引进竞争机制，优化管理人员结构，优化劳动组合，这是提高劳动生产率的重要途径。富余人员主要通过内部消化，或开辟新的就业门路，不要把矛盾推向社会。
    要继续发展和改善横向经济联合与协作，同时注意纠正联合协作过程中出现的某些不良倾向。以产业政策为指导，并坚持自愿原则和产权有偿转让原则，积极促进企业组织结构的合理化。稳步试行以公有制为主体的股份制。小型工商企业，可以继续推行租赁经营，有的可以公开拍卖。发展企业集团，实行企业兼并，试行股份制，都要制定统一办法，有领导、有步骤地进行，不要一哄而起。必须切实防止和坚决纠正廉价出售甚至侵吞国家财产，以及变相扩大消费基金等错误做法。
    为了适应改革开放和发展有计划商品经济的要求，加强和改善宏观经济调控体系十分重要。我们在这方面还缺乏经验，必须在实践中积极探索。在治理整顿期间加强宏观调控，要综合运用经济的、行政的、法律的、纪律的和思想政治工作的手段，五管齐下，特别要注意更多地采取经济手段。无论采取经济手段还是行政手段，都要尽可能制定必要的法规和制度，避免主观随意性。注意保持政策的稳定性和连续性。重大决策应事先多方论证，努力提高决策的民主化、科学化水平。
    积极稳妥地深化计划、投资体制改革。计划部门要加强和改进国民经济的综合平衡，使计划能够调节和指导全社会的经济发展，并着重加强对预算外资金、对消费基金、对非全民所有制经济单位经营方向和行为的引导与调节，促进经济总量的平衡和经济结构的协调，为发展社会主义商品经济服务。根据国家颁布的产业政策，实行合理的投资倾斜政策和改革投资体制，以利于引导和加强对能源、交通、原材料等基础产业的投资，促进投资结构和产业结构的调整。
    加强和改善宏观经济管理，要特别重视发挥银行的调控作用。根据国家的产业政策和进出口政策，充分运用利率、再贷款、准备金率和备付金等经济手段，控制货币发行，调节信贷规模和结构，引导经济健康运行。中国人民银行承担着中央银行的职能，必须加强统一管理，强化垂直领导。各专业银行也承担着宏观调控的责任，决不能因为实行企业化管理而影响和削弱这方面的职责。各级政府要支持银行的工作，不要干预银行的具体业务，更不能强制银行发放贷款。要清理、整顿各类非银行金融机构，明确业务范围和资金使用方向。继续有领导、有秩序地发展短期资金市场，组织好资金拆借和其他多种形式的资金融通，为生产和流通服务。银行要加强现金管理制度，发展票据结算等现代化结算手段，并通过提高利率，改善服务等措施，进一步稳定和增加城乡居民储蓄，增加货币回笼。
    健全审计监督制度，是加强宏观调控的重要内容。要坚决执行《宪法》中有关审计的规定和国务院发布的《审计条例》，使审计工作逐步实现经常化、制度化、规范化。当前，特别要加强对基本建设、行政事业单位开支、消费基金和流通活动的审计。加强统计工作和发挥统计监督的作用。
    积极研究财政体制改革，逐步理顺中央与地方的财政关系。逐步实行复式预算，把经常性财政开支与政府投资区别开来。税务机构和人员逐步实行以垂直领导为主的体制。在有条件的地方，继续进行改税前还贷为税后还贷的试验，逐步向税利分流的方向发展。目前，国家财政收入占国民收入的比重过低，中央财政收入占全部财政收入的比重也偏低，必须采取有效措施，调整分配结构，适当集中资金。要进一步加强税务机构，健全各项税收的法律、法规和制度，清理、整顿和明确各级政府对各项减免税的管理权限，减少税收的严重流失。
    为了抑制消费需求膨胀和缓解社会分配不公的矛盾，必须逐步改进分配制度。机关、事业单位的现行工资制度要继续进行改革，使之逐步完善。企业要推行和完善工资总额同经济效益挂钩的制度，使职工工资的增长真正建立在提高劳动生产率和经济效益的基础之上。坚决取缔非法收入，保护合法收入。从今年起，将尽快建立和完善个人应税收入的申报制度，进一步加强个人收入调节税的征收工作，以调节收入差距的过分悬殊。这项工作先从大城市做起，先在各级领导机关和各类公司人员以及个体工商户中开始实行。依法纳税是所有应税单位和个人应尽的义务和责任，必须通过广泛深入的宣传教育使所有企业和公民都养成依法纳税的守法观念，并同一切偷税漏税的违法行为进行坚决的斗争。
    积极推进有利于遏制通货膨胀、控制社会需求和正确引导消费的其他改革。继续推行城镇居民住房制度的改革，合理制定出售公房的统一原则、分类标准和定价办法。通过逐步实行住房商品化，促进建筑业及其他相关产业的发展，促进消费结构合理化。继续进行社会保险和社会保障制度改革的试点。发挥保险事业在组织经济补偿、积累建设资金、稳定人民生活和引导消费资金分流等方面的作用。深化劳动制度和用工制度改革，发展和完善劳务市场。清理压缩计划外用工，严格控制乡村劳动力盲目流入城市。
    七、在治理整顿中积极发展对外开放
    这次治理整顿和经济调整与历次的经济调整不同，是在对外开放的条件下进行的。国际经济环境对我们比较有利。我们必须充分利用这个有利条件，扩大对外贸易和加强对外经济技术合作，使对外开放与治理整顿互相促进。
    必须坚持执行沿海地区发展战略，继续发展外向型经济。这样做有利于缓解国内原材料供应紧张的矛盾，充分发挥国内劳动力资源丰富的优势，促进治理整顿目标的实现。沿海地区要抓住时机，扬长避短，及时调整经济结构，不断提高经济素质，努力增加“两头在外”产品在出口贸易中的比重。要采取切实有效的措施，进一步利用“以进养出”、“三来一补”等多种与外商合作的形式，大力开拓国际市场。沿海地区也要积极治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序，在发展外向型经济时同样不能一哄而起，齐头并进，也不能竞相扩大对外开放的优惠条件，更不能在追求高消费上互相攀比。要正确处理沿海和内地的经济关系，使它们能够在平等互利的基础上分工协作，互相促进，共同发展。
    努力保证今年对外贸易的持续发展，对稳定经济全局非常重要。要积极发展出口生产，继续贯彻执行有关鼓励出口的政策措施。从治理整顿的需要出发，外贸出口要坚持内外销统筹兼顾的原则，调整出口结构，逐步减少资源性产品、初加工产品的出口比重，增加机电产品等工业制成品的出口，发展创汇农业产品的出口，增加深度加工和高技术产品的出口，并且要更新花式品种，提高产品质量，增强在国际市场上的竞争能力。外贸企业要进一步加强和改善经营管理，努力挖掘潜力，提高资金使用率。要发扬我国“重合同、守信用”的传统，努力克服目前外贸工作中的缺点，提高我国的外贸信誉。外贸进口也要根据治理整顿和产业政策的要求作适当调整，严格限制一些高档消费品的进口，把有限的外汇用于进口工农业生产和国家重点建设急需的原材料、农用生产资料、先进技术、关键设备和零部件，缓解国内市场的供求矛盾，促进经济发展。要有计划有组织地扩大边境贸易，协调发展旅游事业，积极开拓国际承包劳务市场，提高对外承包工程和劳务合作的经济效益，努力增加外汇收入。
    积极利用外资和引进先进技术，是我们长期不变的既定政策。无论是当前还是今后，吸收外资和引进技术都必须符合我国的产业政策。要鼓励和吸引外商来我国多办一些独资企业，多办一些利用我国现有企业进行改造的合资合作企业。必须加强对外汇外债的统一管理，适当控制外债规模，提高外资的使用效益。继续改善投资环境，健全经济法制，帮助外商解决实际困难，保障外商依法从事经营活动。同外商已经签定的协议和合同，必须恪守信誉，严格履行。
    近几年来外贸体制改革的方向是正确的，成绩是主要的。在治理整顿中，继续深化外贸体制改革，切实加强宏观管理和监督，执行国家统一的贸易政策，建立对外贸易的良好秩序，克服对外贸易中的紊乱现象。对前段时期进出口经营权的下放情况，要进行一次认真的清理和整顿，对不符合条件的，没有信誉的，取消其经营权。今后进出口经营权主要授予那些有条件有资信的大中型企业或企业集团，支持他们按照国家政策放手经营，开拓国际市场。
    八、努力创造良好的稳定的社会政治环境
    坚持四项基本原则，充分发挥政治优势，努力创造良好的稳定的政治和社会环境，是顺利实现治理整顿任务的重要保证。
    根据中国共产党第十三次全国代表大会的部署，我国的政治体制改革正在积极稳妥地向前推进。党政分开和机构改革迈出了重要的步伐，人民协商对话制度积极推行，法制不健全的状况逐步改变。在经济上进行治理整顿期间，我们要进一步加强社会主义民主和社会主义法制建设，保障广大人民群众的民主权利，坚持和完善共产党领导的多党合作制度和政治协商制度，充分发挥民主党派、无党派爱国人士和群众团体的参政议政、民主监督作用，加强城乡基层政权组织建设，巩固和发展安定、团结、民主、和谐的政治局面。任何社会动荡和混乱都不利于建设和改革的进行，严重损害全国各族人民的根本利益，是违背广大群众的心愿的。要深入进行普法教育，增强人民的法制观念。在贯彻宪法和各项法律的基础上，完善行政法规和制度，并严格执法。各级政府和各部门必须带头遵纪守法，同时从各方面支持和监督司法行政部门依法行使职权。通过加强民主监督和执法工作，维护政纪国法，严厉惩处严重破坏经济的犯罪分子，坚决打击和依法从重从快惩处严重危害社会治安的犯罪分子。坚决打击流氓团伙和卖淫嫖娼、贩卖人口等犯罪行为。各级政府要动员和组织广大群众的力量，重视和发挥城市居民委员会和农村村民委员会的作用，实行综合治理，强化社会治安，共同维护良好的生产秩序、工作秩序、学习秩序和生活秩序。
    国务院的机构改革已按原定计划基本完成，今年的任务主要是巩固改革成果，进一步理顺部门之间和部门内部的关系，在实际工作中逐步实现职能转变，提高工作效率。为了集中力量搞好治理整顿，原定今年开始的省、直辖市、自治区一级的政府机构改革，决定暂缓进行。
    经济要发展，政府要廉洁。对中共中央、国务院已经制定的一系列廉政制度，国务院和各级政府一定要带头执行，做出表率。必须严厉查处违反国家规定滥发钱物、用公款请客送礼、大吃大喝、游山玩水、营造私房的有关领导和直接责任者；严厉查处国家工作人员特别是领导干部的严重官僚主义和失职、渎职行为；必须维护政令法令的严肃性，坚决纠正有令不行、有禁不止的无组织无纪律现象。凡处理同广大群众利益直接相关的事情，要积极推行公开办事制度，公开办事结果。要增加政务活动的透明度，强化制约机制，使各种权力的行使都能严格置于法规、制度的规范约束和广大干部、群众的监督之下。工商行政、税务、物价、审计、海关、公安等执法、监督部门必须加强自身建设，提高工作人员的政治和业务素质，秉公执法，坚决有效地同违法违纪现象作斗争。各级监察部门要把工作重点放到查处贪污受贿、敲诈勒索、奢侈浪费和各种以权谋私的行为上来，狠刹腐败风气，集中力量及时依法查处大案要案，公开处理结果，发挥威慑力量，使廉政工作收到实效。
    建设社会主义现代化必须坚持物质文明和精神文明一起抓，使它们相互结合，相互促进。一个精神文明素质不高的民族是不可能实现现代化的。各级政府务必高度重视精神文明建设，把这项工作提到重要的议事日程上来。在大力发展社会主义商品经济的条件下，我们既要讲物质利益，又要反对“一切向钱看”。建设社会主义商品经济新秩序，既需要新的管理体制和相应的法律、法规，更需要社会公德、职业道德、文明礼貌的普及和提高，大力提倡对祖国、对社会的奉献精神，大力提倡相互尊重、相互关心、相互帮助、敬老爱幼的社会风尚。在改革开放的新形势下，必须切实加强并认真改进思想政治工作，坚持进行爱国主义、集体主义、社会主义教育，进行自力更生、艰苦创业、发扬革命传统和增强民族自尊自强自信心的教育，培养社会主义的一代代新人。要坚持为社会主义、为人民服务的方向，切实贯彻执行百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，通过发展必要的社会物质文化条件和适当的舆论环境，制定和实施文化方面的经济政策，加强文化市场的整顿、管理和建设，保证和促进文化艺术的健康发展。充分发挥新闻、出版、广播、电影、电视在精神文明建设中的促进作用，积极宣传“实现四化、振兴中华”的先进事迹、先进人物。广大理论工作者要结合改革开放和现代化建设的实际，深化建设有中国特色的社会主义理论的研究，用新的理论成果来回答现实生活提出的问题。坚持不懈地在广大城乡开展群众性的移风易俗活动。对反动、淫秽、丑恶的东西，决不能任其自由泛滥；对扰乱社会秩序和毒害人民身心健康的封建迷信、赌博活动，必须依法取缔。
    发展体育运动，增强人民体质，是建设精神文明的一项重要内容。要努力发扬高尚的体育风格和为祖国争光的拚搏精神，办好1990年在我国举行的亚洲运动会。努力做好卫生工作，积极贯彻预防为主的方针，广泛开展爱国卫生运动，提高人民的健康水平。人口老龄化越来越成为我国社会的重要问题，各地区、各部门都应关心老年工作。
    实行计划生育，控制人口增长，提高人口素质，关系到我国四个现代化的进程，关系到中华民族的生存大计，是我国的基本国策。我国大陆总人口即将达到十一亿，目前又处在人口生育高峰，因此丝毫不能放松对人口增长的控制。各级政府必须充分认识控制人口增长的必要性和紧迫性，把控制社会总需求和控制人口增长结合起来，切实加强对计划生育工作的领导，大力支持计划生育工作者的工作。要坚定不移地、认真地、全面地贯彻执行现行的计划生育政策，提倡晚婚晚育，少生优生，坚持一对夫妇只生育一个孩子，同时采取切实可行的措施，坚决制止多胎生育和早婚早育。少数民族也要提倡计划生育，以利于经济发展和社会进步。
    切实加强环境保护，也是我国的一项基本国策。各级政府必须把环境保护作为关系经济发展和社会发展全局的重要问题来抓，切实加强领导，采取坚决措施，控制环境污染的发展。要广泛动员各方面的力量，植树造林，绿化祖国，进一步改善生态环境。
    在经济调整时期乃至整个现代化建设时期，都要大力巩固和发展平等、团结、互助的社会主义民族关系。这是全国各族人民的根本利益所在，是实现祖国四化和各民族共同繁荣的保障。要继续动员和组织社会各方面的力量，帮助少数民族地区更好地发展经济和文化。坚定不移地贯彻执行民族区域自治法，尽快制定具体实施细则，切实保障自治地方的自治权利，大力培养少数民族干部和科技管理人才。对于少数民族地区在治理整顿中确实存在的一些特殊情况和问题，要注意研究并采取相应的政策措施。我国现阶段民族关系中发生的问题，一般都属于根本利益一致基础上的人民内部矛盾，应当通过民主协商、贯彻民族政策和进行民族政策的再教育，妥善解决。要尊重公民的宗教信仰自由和少数民族的风俗习惯，保护正常的宗教活动。
    最近，少数分裂主义分子在拉萨制造骚乱，引起了全国各族人民的关注。为了维护祖国统一和民族团结，维护社会秩序和保障人民的人身、财产安全，国务院决定在拉萨实行戒严，得到了广大藏族同胞和全国人民的拥护，打击了少数分裂主义分子的反动气焰。现在，拉萨社会秩序正在逐步恢复正常，人民生活趋于安定。我们实行的支持和促进西藏经济和文化发展，保护藏族人民宗教信仰自由，尊重当地风俗习惯等一系列现行政策，都不会改变。达赖喇嘛只要放弃“西藏独立”的主张，不进行分裂活动，维护祖国统一和民族团结，中央政府就愿意同他进行谈判。众所周知，西藏自治区是中华人民共和国领土不可分割的一部分，任何人搞“西藏独立”都是不能得逞的。任何外国势力不管用什么借口支持“西藏独立”的分裂活动，都是对中国内政的粗暴干涉，是绝对不能允许的。
    加强国防建设，对捍卫我国的民族利益和国家安全，有着十分重要的意义。在经济调整时期以至整个现代化建设进程中，都必须重视国防建设，使我国的国防力量与国家地位相适应。人民解放军要继续服从国家建设的大局，搞好自身的各项建设和改革，不断增强战斗力。要进一步发展国防科技，搞好国防后备力量建设。各级政府要关心和支持军队，积极主动地帮助他们解决各种实际问题，尽力为军队建设和改革创造良好条件。发扬拥政爱民、拥军优属的光荣传统，进一步密切军政军民关系。在全国范围内进行经常性的国防教育，并纳入整个国民教育的体系，不断增强全民的国防意识。同时，要逐步完善各项国防立法，保证国防建设的顺利进行。
    各位代表！
    在过去的一年里，我国政府为了贯彻执行中英、中葡关于香港、澳门问题的联合声明，同英国和葡萄牙政府进行了良好的合作。双方官员以及中英、中葡联合联络小组通过磋商，就有关顺利过渡的一系列问题达成了协议。经过广泛征询意见和反复修改后形成的《中华人民共和国香港特别行政区基本法（草案）》已由全国人民代表大会常务委员会审议公布，正在进一步征询意见，经再次修改后，将提请第七届全国人民代表大会第三次会议通过。澳门特别行政区基本法的起草工作也已于去年开始，预计将在1993年完成。国务院各有关部门积极参与和配合了由全国人大常委会主持的这两个基本法的起草工作。我们相信，随着中英、中葡联合声明的进一步贯彻执行，我国内地同港澳的经济联系必将有更大的发展，对我国的改革开放和港澳地区的稳定繁荣必将起到更为积极的促进作用。
    近年来，台湾海峡两岸关系发生了显著的变化。长期紧张对峙、相互隔绝的不正常状态已有初步改变，两岸经济文化交流和人员往来日益增多。这是两岸同胞共同努力的结果。台湾当局为缓和两岸关系也采取了一些措施，但至今仍坚持“三不”（不妥协、不谈判、不接触）的拒绝和谈立场，最近又加紧推行“弹性外交”，制造“两个中国”和“一中一台”，这是同海峡两岸同胞的根本利益和愿望相违背的。我们主张“和平统一”和“一国两制”，坚决反对任何可能导致台湾独立的言论和行动。我们真诚地希望同台湾当局和各界人士共商国是，就发展两岸交流和祖国统一问题进行接触和协商。找们希望台湾当局尽早放弃不合情理的“三不”政策，消除人为的障碍，使两岸人员双向对等地往来，公开、直接地进行“三通”（通邮、通商、通航），开展两岸间经贸、文化、体育、科技和学术等各种交流。我们热诚欢迎台湾企业界来大陆投资设厂，兴办各种实业，互利互惠，发展民族经济。我们相信，在两岸同胞的共同努力下，两岸关系必将更加深入地发展，祖国统一大业一定能够实现。
    各位代表！
    过去一年里世界上的一系列重大事件表明，国际形势正在发生着转折性的变化：从对抗转向对话，从紧张转向缓和，已经在全世界形成强大的潮流。这是世界各国共同努力的结果，它反映了全世界人民维护和平、谋求发展的强烈愿望。今天，世界和平出现了更加令人鼓舞的前景。但是，导致国际形势紧张、动荡的各种因素并未消除，争取长期稳定的和平，还需要世界各国人民坚持不懈的努力。
      中国一贯奉行独立自主的和平外交政策，支持世界人民的正义事业，反对霸权主义，维护世界和平，促进共同发展。本着这样的政策，我们积极开展外交工作，广泛进行国际交往，增进国家间的合作和人民间的友谊，既维护我国的民族利益和国家安全，为我国的现代化建设事业争取长期的国际和平环境，也为国际形势的缓和作出了自己的努力。
    中美建交十年来，两国在许多领域的合作有了显著的进展。
  中美之间保持的高层接触和对话，对推动两国关系的发展起了重要作用。继续扩大中美经济贸易和科技合作关系，增进各方面的友好往来，符合两国的根本利益。我们希望美国政府恪守
  中美三个联合公报的原则，恪守一个中国的立场，并且不要在
  任何问题上以任何方式干涉中国的内政，以免在业已存在的中
  美友好关系上投下我们双方都不愿看到的阴影。
      中苏关系正常化是大家关心的重大问题。多年来，双方就消除三大障碍、实现两国关系正常化进行了多次谈判和磋商，
  现在已经有了实质性的进展，中苏高级会晤即将举行。我们认
  为，苏联在促使越南从柬埔寨真正撤军、推动政治解决柬埔寨
  问题上，能够而且有责任继续作出积极的努力。中苏国家关系
  正常化以后，将在和平共处五项原则的基础上发展睦邻友好关系。这不仅符合中苏两国人民的根本利益，而且有利于亚洲和世界的和平与稳定，不会损害任何第三国的利益。
    同亚洲近邻各国和睦相处、友好合作，是我国政府一贯的政策。我国同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国之间的传统友谊不断增强。我们关心朝鲜半岛的和平与稳定，支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国关于自主和平统一的合理主张，希望朝鲜北南双方的对话和接触能够取得积极的成果。中国同南朝鲜不存在官方关系，但有民间的经济贸易往来。中国和巴基斯坦等南亚国家之间长期存在的深厚友谊，近年来得到了进一步的巩固和发展。中国和印度最近在改善两国关系方面取得了积极的成果，有利于双方通过友好协商解决边界问题，恢复和发展睦邻关系。我们同泰国以及其他东盟国家在维护东南亚和平的问题上有着共同的观点，同他们就公正合理地政治解决柬埔寨问题保持着密切的磋商。中国愿意在和平共处五项原则的基础上，同东南亚各国进一步发展友好合作关系。我们高兴地看到我国和印度尼西亚之间最近开始了关系正常化的进程，希望两国尽快恢复友好关系。我国和老挝的关系有了改善，去年重新互派了大使。我国同蒙古人民共和国签订了关于边界制度和处理边境问题的条约，两国关系有了新的发展。
    中日两国关系总的来说是好的，双方的经济贸易往来和科技文化交流有了很大的发展，但也存在着一些值得重视和需要妥善解决的问题。过去日本军国主义者发动侵略战争，给中国和亚洲其他国家的人民带来了严重的灾难，这场战争的性质是不容改变的。只有正确对待历史，才能更好地开创未来。我们十分珍惜两国政治家和人民经过长期努力培育起来的中日友谊，希望这种友谊世代相传，希望两国睦邻友好关系在中日联合声明和中日和平友好条约的基础上得到长期的稳定发展。
    解决柬埔寨问题的关键是越南真正从柬埔寨全部撤军。越南既已表示至迟不超过今年9月从柬埔寨全部撤军，就应该言而有信，决不能以任何借口或任何形式把军队留下来。为此，撤军需要有效的国际监督。柬埔寨问题的国际方面和国内方面不能截然分开，越南作为造成柬埔寨问题的直接当事国，理所当然地对实现柬埔寨国内和平和民族和解负有责任。中国支持建立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府，这将有利于实现柬埔寨和平，避免发生内战。只有柬埔寨问题得到解决，中越关系才能实现正常化。
    苏联从阿富汗撤军已经完成，这是值得欢迎的。我们希望阿富汗各派政治力量通过协商，早日建立基础广泛的联合政府，使难民安全返回家园，使人民能够重享和平，建设国家。阿富汗国内局势的稳定及其独立、中立和不结盟地位的恢复，将有助于南亚地区的和平与发展。
    我国和东欧国家都在积极寻求适合本国情况的社会主义建设道路。我们之间在建设社会主义方面有不少经验可以互相交流，互相借鉴。我们愿意同东欧国家在和平共处五项原则的基础上继续发展各方面的关系。
    加强同西欧各国和加拿大、澳大利亚、新西兰的友好合作，是我国外交工作的一项长期方针。欧洲共同体是我国的重要贸易伙伴。我国同西欧各国的经济技术合作继续稳步发展，并且还有巨大的潜力有待开发。我们希望双方共同努力，在更加广阔的领域里开展合作。
    加强同非洲国家的团结合作是我们坚定不移的国策。我们将一如既往，坚决支持非洲人民为维护民族权益、振兴国家经济所作的努力。我们高兴地看到，许多非洲国家之间出现了改善关系、加强团结的势头。我们对有关各方达成政治解决西南部非洲问题的协议表示欢迎，希望纳米比亚能顺利实现独立，安哥拉和莫桑比克能早日恢复和平，前线国家的主权和安全能得到保障。中国一贯强烈谴责种族歧视，坚决支持非洲各国人民反对南非种族隔离制度的正义斗争。
    我国同阿拉伯国家的友好合作关系有了新的发展。去年我国同卡塔尔建立了外交关系，同沙特阿拉伯签署了互设商务代表处的谅解备忘录。我们关心中东问题的和平解决。巴勒斯坦国的成立和巴勒斯坦解放组织最近采取的一系列灵活、现实的做法，为加速中东和平进程作出了新的贡献，受到国际社会的欢迎。我们希望美国同巴勒斯坦解放组织的对话能取得实质性进展。以色列当局应该停止对被占领土人民的镇压，顺应时代潮流，对有关各方谋求中东和平的努力作出积极响应。我们主张召开联合国主持下的国际会议，促使中东问题早日获得公正合理的政治解决。
    我们高兴地看到伊朗和伊拉克实现了停火，希望它们的谈判能够导致两国之间的持久和平，使两国人民能够重整遭受战争破坏的经济，建设自己的国家。
    我们同拉丁美洲国家的合作关系发展顺利。去年我国同阿根廷、巴西签订了多项科技合作协定，双边合作进入了新的领域，这对促进南南合作具有重要意义。我们同拉美一些尚未建交国家的友好交往也有所增加。中国同拉美各国发展友好合作关系的前景是十分广阔的。
    我们一贯重视并支持不结盟运动，希望它在新的国际形势下发挥更大影响。
    近年来，联合国在国际事务中，特别是在调解和解决地区冲突、推动国际形势走向缓和方面，发挥着越来越重要的作用。中国作为联合国安全理事会常任理事国，积极参加了联合国各个领域的活动。我们愿同世界各国共同努力，使联合国在维护国际和平与安全，以及促进发展的事业中发挥更加积极的作用。
    世界在经历了长期的紧张、动荡之后出现的缓和趋势，值得人民倍加爱护。为推动国际形势继续向着缓和的方向发展，中国政府倡议在互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处五项原则的基础上建立国际政治新秩序。这五项原则经受了历史的检验，具有强大的生命力。在这样的新秩序下，国家不分大小强弱，一律平等，互相尊重，任何国家都不把自己的意志强加于人，都不谋求霸权。各国的内部事务由各国自己处理，世界的共同事务由各国协商办理。不同社会制度、不同意识形态、不同发展程度的国家友好相处，一切国际争端都通过和平谈判解决，而不诉诸武力或以武力相威胁。我们深信，这样的世界将是符合各国人民愿望的。
    随着国际形势的缓和，各国正把更多的注意力转向发展问题。现在许多国家都在进行改革或调整，各国间的经济和科技交流日益密切，这是顺应时代潮流的。当前值得国际社会严重关注的问题是，第三世界国家的债务负担越来越重，南北差距继续扩大，发达国家贸易保护主义倾向的增强更加重了发展中国家的经济困难。这种不合理的国际经济秩序必须改变。发达国家有责任帮助发展中国家发展经济，并通过协商使债务问题得到妥善解决。这不仅有利于发展中国家，而且归根到底也有利于发达国家，有利于世界局势的稳定。中国在积极开展南南合作的同时，支持通过对话促进南北合作，主张在平等互利的基础上建立国际经济新秩序，以利于各国的共同繁荣。
    我国政府将继续执行独立自主的和平外交政策，并把加强同各国的经济、科技合作放到更加重要的地位。我们将更加积极和灵活地开展对外工作，进一步扩大同世界各国的友好交往，同世界各国一道，为推动国际形势继续朝着有利于和平与发展的方向前进而努力。
    各位代表！
    总的来看，当前的国内和国际形势对我国的建设和改革都是有利的。我们在国内经济建设中面临的困难，其性质是前进中的问题，发展中的问题。只要我们上下一致，群策群力，就一定能够共渡难关，在治理整顿和深化改革中达到预期的目标。我们要同心协力，以优异的成绩迎接中华人民共和国成立40周年，把建设有中国特色的社会主义的宏伟事业继续推向前进！
