Xinhua News Agency, Tongling, April 11th.

The national men's weightlifting championship brought the first piece of good news today after two days of silence. Guangdong's star athlete, Li Jinhe, broke his own national and Asian record in the 67.5 kg class by lifting 148 kg in the snatch.

The competition is being held in Tongling, Anhui. The 25-year-old athlete was in excellent form this afternoon, exuding confidence. He effortlessly lifted 142.5 kg and 145 kg in his first two attempts at the snatch. For his third attempt, he aimed for 148 kg, challenging the record he set at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. However, due to over-exertion, the barbell fell backward. His previously injured right knee began to ache intensely. He endured the pain, wrapped his knee with a bandage, and attempted the lift a fourth time. With a precise and elegant motion, he successfully lifted the barbell, setting a new Asian record. In the clean and jerk, he competed with Sichuan's Wang Yong. Both athletes attempted 185.5 kg in their fourth attempt, challenging the 185 kg Asian record held by South Korean athlete Lee Hee-bong, but both failed.

Li Jinhe ultimately won three gold medals in the 67.5 kg class and a record-breaking award. His clean and jerk result was 180 kg, and his total was 325 kg. Wang Yong secured second place in the clean and jerk and total results.

　　全国男子举重赛传喜讯
　　李金河破一项亚洲纪录
    新华社铜陵4月11日电　（记者郭庆华）沉寂了两天的全国男子举重比赛场上今天传来第一个喜讯。广东名将李金河以抓举148公斤的成绩打破了由他本人保持的67.5公斤级147.5公斤的全国和亚洲纪录。
    比赛在安徽铜陵举行。这位25岁的小伙子今天下午竞技状态良好，显得信心很足。他在第一把和第二把抓举的试举中，轻松地举起了1 42.5公斤和145公斤。紧接着第三把就要了148公斤的重量，向他去年在汉城奥运会上创下的这项全国和亚洲纪录冲击。但由于用力过猛，杠铃向后掉落。此时，他过去受伤的右膝关节十分疼痛。他忍痛缠上绷带，进行第四次试举。一个漂亮准确的动作，终于成功地举起了杠铃，一项新的亚洲纪录诞生了。在挺举中，他和四川选手王勇之间展开了争夺。两人都在第四次试举中要了185.5公斤的重量，同时向南朝鲜选手李熙风保持的185公斤的亚洲纪录发起挑战，但均功亏一篑。
    李金河最后夺得了67.5公斤级的三枚金牌和一项破纪录奖。他的挺举成绩为180公斤，总成绩为325公斤。王勇获得挺举和总成绩两项第二名。
