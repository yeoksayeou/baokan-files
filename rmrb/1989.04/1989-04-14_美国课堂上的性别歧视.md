In the United States, the proportion of women who succeed in their careers is much lower than that of men. Educators have recently pointed out that this is related to gender discrimination in American education.

From elementary school to university, there is a widespread tendency to favor boys over girls. Statistics show that in the classroom, boys have five times more opportunities to receive special attention from teachers than girls; boys are asked questions eight times more often than girls; and among the students praised or held up as examples by teachers, boys are twice as many as girls.

Experts have listened to mathematics and language classes in 100 classrooms across different grades in some primary and secondary schools and found that boys receive more praise, criticism, and guidance than girls. Whether the teachers are male or female, they generally do not pay much attention to girls and usually do not give girls constructive feedback.

This tendency is also evident in universities. Researchers have found that professors interact and provide guidance more with male students. Female students rarely have the opportunity to speak, and they feel suppressed, which leads women to prefer majors where females are in the majority, making them feel more comfortable. A female student at the University of Virginia said that in her French class, the majority were female students, and they dominated the discussions, speaking freely.

Experts point out that when girls are neglected in the classroom, it harms their self-esteem. Such teacher-student relationships leave "aftereffects" that affect students' (including male students') performance after they enter the job market.

Bernice Sender, executive director of the American College Board, pointed out that the lack of self-confidence among female students is related to the bias of favoring boys in the classroom. Education professor David Sackler said, "In the workplace, women generally do not volunteer for important management positions, and they are often less competitive. Most of them are more self-effacing and prefer to be in supporting roles. This is a result of educational gender discrimination."

It is thought-provoking that in many schools, students, teachers, and principals usually do not realize the inequality that occurs in the classroom every day.

Some educators point out that single-sex schools do not have similar problems. All-girls schools and women's colleges create a more positive learning environment for women, where they do not have to fear being ignored.

　　美国课堂上的性别歧视
　　李松
    美国妇女在事业上成功者的比例比男子少得多。教育学家最近指出，这与美国教育的性别歧视有关。
    在美国，从小学到大学，普遍存在着重男轻女的倾向。据统计，在课堂上，男生受到教师特别关注的机会是女生的五倍；男生被提问的机会是女生的八倍；在被教师表扬或树为标兵的学生中，男生是女生的二倍。
    有关专家在一些中小学校听了不同年级一百个班级的数学和语文课，发现男生比女生获得更多的表扬、批评和辅导。不论男教师还是女教师，都不大注意女生，通常不给女生提建设性意见。
    这种倾向在大学也不例外。研究者发现，教授更多地与男生交谈并加以指导。女生很少有发言权，她们感到压抑，这导致了妇女喜欢选择一些女生占多数的专业，这样她们感到舒服些。弗吉尼亚大学的一名女学生说，她所在的法语班上，女生占绝大多数，她们统治了讨论，畅所欲言。
    专家们指出，女生在课堂上遭冷遇，会损害她们的自尊心。这样的师生关系会留下“后遗症”，影响学生（包括男学生）就业后的表现。
    美国大学委员会执行主任伯尼斯·森德勒指出，女生缺少自信心，与课堂上的重男轻女偏见有关。教育学教授戴维·萨克尔说：“在工作岗位，妇女一般很少毛遂自荐，不敢竞争重要的管理职位，她们大多数人比较自卑，甘当配角，这是教育性别歧视造成的后果。”
    发人深省的是，在许多学校中，学生、教师和校长通常没有意识到每天发生在课堂上的这种不平等。
    有些教育工作者指出，单性别学校就不存在类似的问题，所有的女校和女子大学为女性创造了一个更为积极的学习环境，她们不必害怕被冷落。（附图片）
