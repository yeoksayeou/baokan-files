Every holiday, some student parents, when playing cards or mahjong with visiting relatives and friends, often find themselves short of one person. They frequently ask their children to fill in as "supporting roles," even dragging them into drinking and gambling. After doing this repeatedly, children who originally didn't know how to play cards become addicted to gambling, and those who didn't know how to drink start to love alcohol. The "supporting roles" will then become the "main actors."

As parents, during holidays, one should guide children to participate in various activities that are beneficial to their physical and mental health. How can one only care about their own enjoyment and casually drag their children into playing cards and drinking as "supporting roles"? It should be known that once gambling and drinking become habits, not only will they affect the children's studies and health, but they may also lead them astray.

The famous educator Xu Telili once said: "Children are very pure by nature, and their good or bad habits are formed through imitation in the environment they grow up in." As parents, who doesn't hope that their children will become useful individuals? To achieve this goal, perhaps we should start by ensuring that children have a healthy family environment for growth.

### 莫让孩子当这种“配角”

　　莫让孩子当这种“配角”
　　王稼杰
    每逢节假日，有些学生家长同前来串门的亲朋好友玩扑克、打麻将时，遇到“三缺一”人手不够，常找孩子来充当“配角”，甚至喝酒划拳也拉上孩子凑热闹。次数多了，原本不会打牌的孩子迷上了牌，不会喝酒的孩子恋上了酒，“配角”就会变成“主角”。
    作为家长，节假日期间理应指导孩子参加各种有益身心健康的活动，怎么能只顾自己玩得高兴，随意拉他们充当打牌、喝酒的“配角”呢？要知道，打牌、喝酒一旦成瘾，不但会影响孩子的学业和身心健康，还可能使他们步入歧途。
    著名教育家徐特立说过：“幼儿本性是很纯洁的，而他的习惯好坏是在成长过程中所接触的环境逐渐模仿形成。”当家长的谁不希望自己的子女成为有用之材？而要达到这个目的，恐怕还得从保证孩子们有一个健康成长的家庭环境做起。
