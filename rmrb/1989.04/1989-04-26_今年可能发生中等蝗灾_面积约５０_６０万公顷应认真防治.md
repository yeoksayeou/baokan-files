According to a forecast by the National Plant Protection Station of the Ministry of Agriculture, China may experience a moderate locust disaster this year, affecting an area of approximately 500,000 to 600,000 hectares. This prediction is based on the autumn locust survey conducted last year and the spring survey of overwintering eggs this year, combined with the medium- and long-term weather forecasts from the Central Meteorological Bureau. In some regions, such as the Yellow River floodplains in Shaanxi and Henan, the Yellow River estuary in Shandong, and the Luohe Bay in Anhui's Huainan City, high-density locust swarms may appear. Additionally, certain areas in Hebei, Shanxi, and Tianjin may also experience localized high-density locust infestations.

The total area for summer locust control nationwide is expected to be between 300,000 and 500,000 hectares.

　　今年可能发生中等蝗灾    
    面积约５０—６０万公顷应认真防治
    本报北京４月２６日讯  记者蒋建科报道：据农业部全国植保总站预测，今年，我国可能发生中等程度的夏蝗灾害，面积约５０—６０万公顷。这是专家对去年各省秋季残蝗和今年春天各地越冬卵调查后，结合中央气象台中、长期天气预报分析后作出的。局部地区，如陕西、河南境内的黄河滩、山东黄河入海口滩涂以及安徽淮南市洛河湾等地可能出现高密度蝗群。河北、山西、天津也有一些地区可能出现点片高密度蝗虫。
    全国夏蝗防治面积将达３０—５０万公顷。
