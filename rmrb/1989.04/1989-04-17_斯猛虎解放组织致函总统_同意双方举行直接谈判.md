The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has written to President Premadasa agreeing to hold direct talks with him.

According to a statement issued by the LTTE's political committee and quoted by local newspapers today, the LTTE has agreed to direct talks with President Premadasa. The statement said that the LTTE had written to President Premadasa yesterday, requesting him to make the necessary arrangements for the talks. The letter also stated: "You have recognized that foreign armies may exploit our internal conflicts for their own interests. You will understand that we have consistently opposed the policy of bringing foreign armies into the country."

Last week, President Premadasa appealed to the LTTE to engage in direct talks with him to resolve the ethnic conflicts in the northern and eastern parts of Sri Lanka.

Today, President Premadasa demanded that the LTTE's political committee appoint a representative to conduct direct talks with him. This request was made in a letter from the President's secretary to the head of the LTTE's political committee.

Since the signing of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord in July 1987, which saw the deployment of 50,000 Indian soldiers in Sri Lanka, the LTTE has been fighting against the Indian military and has rejected the government's proposals for talks.

　　斯猛虎解放组织致函总统
　　同意双方举行直接谈判
    新华社科伦坡４月１６日电　据此间报纸今天援引斯里兰卡泰米尔伊拉姆猛虎解放组织政治委员会的一份公报说，猛虎解放组织已同意同普雷马达萨总统举行直接会谈。
    公报说，猛虎解放组织昨天写信给普雷马达萨总统，要求他为会谈做出必要的安排。信中还说：“您已认为，外国军队很可能利用我们国内的冲突而获得他们自己的利益。您会认识到，我们一贯反对把外国军队引入国内的政策。”
    普雷马达萨总统上周呼吁猛虎解放组织同他进行直接会谈，以解决斯里兰卡北部和东部的种族冲突。
    普雷马达萨总统今天要求猛虎解放组织政治委员会任命一名代表同他进行直接会谈。这一要求是总统秘书在写给猛虎解放组织政治委员会负责人的信中提出的。
    自１９８７年７月签署印斯协议、５万名印度士兵开进斯里兰卡以来，猛虎解放组织一直在进行反对印军的斗争，并拒绝政府提出关于进行会谈的建议。
