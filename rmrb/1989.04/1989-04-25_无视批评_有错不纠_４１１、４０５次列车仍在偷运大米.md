After your newspaper published the letters from readers and the reporter's investigative note titled "Rice Merchants Using Passenger Trains to Transport Grain" and "Train Staff Helping Rice Merchants Transport Rice" on the fifth page of the February 1 issue, the situation on trains 405 and 411 has not improved. For example, at 9:08 AM on March 11, the staff of the Qidong County Grain and Oil Inspection Station discovered that two carriages and the dining car of the 411 train from Hengyang to Zhanjiang were filled with rice packed in bamboo baskets and woven bags. When the inspector Lei Bin boarded the dining car to conduct the inspection, a police officer intervened and punched Lei in the right eye.

The relevant documents of the State Council clearly stipulate that the management of the grain market should be strengthened and the illegal transportation of grain out of the country should be strictly prohibited. We hope that the relevant departments will strictly follow the regulations, take measures, and crack down on illegal grain merchants in accordance with the law. We also hope that they will promptly handle the incident of rice smuggling on trains 411 and 405.

### 无视批评　有错不纠  ４１１、４０５次列车仍在偷运大米

　　无视批评　有错不纠   
    ４１１、４０５次列车仍在偷运大米
    你报２月１日第五版刊登了《米贩子利用客车贩运粮食》、《列车员帮助米贩子运大米》的读者来信和记者的调查附记，披露了４０５、４１１次列车工作人员和米贩子合伙偷运大米的情况后，这两次列车的状况仍无改观。例如，３月１１日上午９点零８分，衡阳至湛江的４１１次列车驶进祁东车站时，祁东县粮油检查站工作人员发现这次客车的两节车厢及餐车内均有用竹篓和编织袋装的大米。当检查员雷斌上餐车检查时，一名乘警出面干涉，并用拳头打伤了雷的右眼。
    国务院有关文件明确规定，加强粮食市场管理，严禁粮食非法出境。希望有关部门认真按规定办事，采取措施，依法打击不法粮商，迅速处理４１１、４０５次旅客列车偷运大米的事件。
