    Premier Li Peng said today that the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress (NPC) was a success, advancing China's democratic politics.

    Li Peng introduced the NPC session to New Zealand Minister of Foreign Affairs Russell Marshall during their meeting in Zhongnanhai this morning. He emphasized that during the session, heads of various government departments answered questions posed by people's deputies. Li Peng stressed that the work of government departments is under the supervision of people's deputies, which can make department heads more cautious in their work.

    Li Peng pointed out that improving cultural levels is the foundation for advancing democratic politics. He said that China will in the future strengthen its work in education, especially vocational education. We will improve the quality of the entire nation through education.

    The two sides also exchanged views on Sino-New Zealand relations and international issues of mutual concern.
