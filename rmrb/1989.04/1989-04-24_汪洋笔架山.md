About 70 kilometers southwest of Jinzhou, in the near-shore waters of the vast Bohai Sea, stands a small island, towering above the endless waves. The island features three peaks, with the central one being the highest and the other two lower, resembling a pen holder, hence the name Pen Frame Mountain. When the sun rises from the sea, the mountain is bathed in a myriad of golden rays, surrounded by the shimmering sea, creating a myriad of magical scenes. This spectacle is what the ancients called "Pen Peak Piercing the Sea."

From the shore to Pen Frame Mountain, it is a distance of 4 kilometers across the sea. When the tide recedes, a 30-meter-wide stone beach appears between the shore and the mountain base, resembling a long causeway, known as the "Sky Bridge," allowing vehicles and horses to pass, much like the legends of "Ne Zha Causing Trouble in the Sea" and "Zhang Fei Cooking the Sea," where a chant or a wave of a golden hairpin can part the vast sea, revealing a path straight to the dragon palace.

On Pen Frame Mountain, there is a stone-built mountain gate inscribed with "Illuminating the Nation and the Family" on the front and "Revering the Way and Cherishing Virtue" on the back. These inscriptions were written by the Daoist who oversaw the mountain's construction. The mountain originally had the Ming Dynasty structure, the Temple of the Rising Sun, of which only the walls remain. The existing structures were built during the Republic of China period, including the Lvzu Pavilion, the Queen Mother Palace, the Three Pure Ones Hall, and the Hall of Ten Thousand Buddhas. On the south side of the main peak, there are notable sights such as the One-Line Sky, the Horse Saddle Bridge, the Tiger Pit Cave, and the Elephant Trunk Cave. The "Tiger Pit Cave" has a legend: Once, when Guanyin was wandering the Bohai Sea, she stayed on Pen Frame Mountain. Just then, a ferocious tiger was attacking fishermen. Guanyin shook the willow branch in her hand, and suddenly a cave appeared on the mountain, trapping the tiger inside. During the late Ming Dynasty's Liaodong War, the island was a strategic grain storage site for the Governor-General of Ji and Lia, Hong Chengchou, with "twelve piles of grain." After the defeat, it was seized by the Qing troops, and traces of it can still be found on the island today.

　　汪洋笔架山
    李洪
    距锦州７０华里的西南海域中，茫茫渤海近海处有一座小岛，亭亭兀立于烟波浩渺的大海之中。岛上三峰列峙，中高二低，悬崖峭壁，状如笔架，故得名笔架山。每当旭日喷薄出海，笔架山身披万道霞光，被流金闪动的大海烘托着，变幻出万般神奇。这奇观，便是前人称谓的“笔峰插海”。
    从岸上到笔架山，跨海４华里。潮退，海岸至山麓之间，出现一条宽３０多米的石滩，状似长堤，名曰“天桥”，可通车马，很像“哪吒闹海”和“张羽煮海”等神话故事中说的，“念动咒语”或“金簪一划”，汪洋大海便分出一条水路，直通龙宫。
    笔架山上有一座石造的山门，上书“光耀家国”，背面又书“重道亲德”。这是当年主持修山的道人所写。山上原有明末建筑朝阳寺，今存空堵。现存建筑均为民国年间营造，主要有吕祖亭、王母宫、三清阁、万佛堂等。主峰南面有一线天、马鞍桥、虎陷洞、象鼻洞等名胜。“虎陷洞”有一传说：当年观音漫游渤海时，曾在笔架山小住，恰遇一只斑斓猛虎劫食渔民。观音把手中净瓶的柳枝一摇，山头忽地露出一洞，把虎陷了进去。明末辽西大战，岛上曾为蓟辽总督洪承畴屯粮重地，有“积粟十二堆”。兵败，为清兵所获，至今岛上尚有踪迹可寻。
