	According to a former Royal Navy spy from World War I, Britain knew in advance about the attack on Pearl Harbor. On December 7, 1941, then-U.S. President Roosevelt called it "a day that will live in infamy": on this day, the Japanese navy launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, leading to the outbreak of the Pacific War. Nearly half a century later, Eric Nave, a former British Royal Navy wartime codebreaker residing in Melbourne, Australia, revealed in his book "The Secret Life of a Codebreaker" that Britain had decrypted Japan's code a month before the "Pearl Harbor incident" and knew that Japan would attack Pearl Harbor, but did not inform the United States.

	After the book was published, the British government deemed Nave's claims to be "baseless" and instructed defense department officials to pressure the publisher to stop selling the book. Upon learning of the book ban, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) sent a reporter to Australia to interview the former codebreaker and filmed a documentary titled "The Sacrifices of Pearl Harbor." Nave told the reporter that Britain's wartime codebreaking organization in the Far East "intercepted all of Japan's codes."

	James Rushbriger, who co-authored "The Secret Life of a Codebreaker" with Nave, said upon learning of the book ban that Nave's memoirs did not compromise national security but rather put Britain in an awkward position. The codes he deciphered are unrelated to today's codes. After the "Pearl Harbor incident," the United States also deciphered Japan's codes, leading to the decisive victory in the Battle of Midway in June 1942, which should be entirely attributed to codebreaking work.

	Since 1939, Germany and Japan had been using the German-invented "Enigma" machine to transmit military intelligence and secret communications. However, the British quickly mastered the key to decrypting the "Enigma" code, while the Germans and Japanese remained oblivious.

	The banning of "The Secret Life of a Codebreaker" naturally led people to recall the recent "Spycatcher" controversy. The British government had similarly banned the publication, printing, and newspaper reprinting of "Spycatcher" by former MI5 member Peter Wright on the grounds of national security, but the government ultimately lost the case. What will be the fate of "The Secret Life of a Codebreaker"? People are watching closely.

　　据皇家海军一战时谍报员透露
　　英国事先知道偷袭珍珠港
　　曹聪
    １９４１年１２月７日被当时的美国总统罗斯福称为“一个永远蒙受耻辱的日子”：这一天日本海军偷袭珍珠港，导致了太平洋战争的爆发。在时隔将近半个世纪之后，现在居住在澳大利亚墨尔本的前英国皇家海军战时谍报人员艾立克·内弗上尉，在《特派密码破译员》一书中披露了这样一个事实：英国早在“珍珠港事件”发生之前一个月就破译了日本的密码，知道日本将偷袭珍珠港，但却未通告美国。
    内弗的书出版后，英国政府认为内弗所说纯属“子虚乌有”，责成国防部官员对出版商施加压力，禁止销售此书。英国广播公司（ＢＢＣ）得悉禁书的消息后，派记者前往澳大利亚，采访了这位前谍报人员，并拍摄了一部题为《珍珠港的牺牲者》的专题片。内弗对记者说，英国战时在远东的密码破译机构“截获了日本的所有密码”。
    与内弗合作撰写《特派密码破译员》一书的詹姆斯·拉什布赖特在得悉此书被禁的消息后说，内弗上尉的回忆并没有危害到国家安全，倒是使英国处于尴尬境地。因为他破译的密码与今天的密码无关。“珍珠港事件”后，美国也破译了日本的密码，从而获致１９４２年６月中途岛海战的辉煌胜利，这也应完全归功于密码破译工作。
    从１９３９年起，德国、日本都使用德国发明的“艾格尼玛”发报机传递军事情报和秘密通讯。然而，英国人很快就掌握了破译“艾格尼玛”密码的关键，而德国人、日本人一直蒙在鼓里。
    由《特派密码破译员》的被禁，人们自然而然联想到不久前结束的“《抓间谍者》风波”。英国政府曾同样以有碍国家安全为由，禁止前英国反谍报机关ＭＩＳ成员彼得·赖特所著《抓间谍者》一书在英国印刷、发行和报纸转载，结果英国政府败诉。《特派密码破译员》的命运如何？人们正拭目以待。
