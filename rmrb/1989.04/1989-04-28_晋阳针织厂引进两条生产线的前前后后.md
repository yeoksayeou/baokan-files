JinYang Knitting Factory borrowed 684 million yuan (including 127 million US dollars in foreign exchange) to import two production lines. One of the lines, a suit production line, has been out of operation for four years. Some of the machines have been repurposed, while others remain unopened. The other line, a non-woven fabric production line, has been semi-operational for over three years, running intermittently and achieving only 1/7 of its designed capacity. The factory is now heavily in debt, and workers are shaking their heads in dismay. Currently, the factory spends six to seven million yuan annually just on interest payments. How did this situation come to pass?

Upon investigation, we were shocked to discover that the relevant departments handled the import of such a large project with remarkable carelessness. The personnel involved had only a rough idea of the import plan before the contract was signed. Only after the contract was formally signed did the relevant departments hurriedly begin conducting the feasibility study that should have been the basis for the contract. Due to the rushed timeline, they still did not produce a formal feasibility study report, only an implementation plan for approval. Consider the following facts:

On April 24, 1984, the contract to import the non-woven fabric production line was signed; on June 12, the contract to import the suit production line was signed. On May 4 and June 21, respectively, the implementation plans for importing these two production lines were submitted. On July 2 and July 5, the Provincial Economic Commission approved them. It was not until October 31 that the relevant departments sent personnel to Japan for an inspection.

Please note that once the contract is signed, it becomes legally binding and cannot be changed at will. However, the relevant departments signed the contract first, then submitted the implementation plan for approval by higher authorities, and only then sent personnel to Japan for an inspection. Yet, before the inspection team even arrived in Japan, most of the equipment for these two production lines had already been packed and shipped according to the contract terms. Due to insufficient feasibility studies, the imported equipment was not thoroughly and meticulously evaluated, resulting in the discovery that the newly built factory, originally planned to house two production lines, could only accommodate one. Additionally, the height of the new factory was insufficient to install the equipment. The auxiliary supporting projects, such as air conditioning, cables, and pipes, originally intended to match the imported equipment, were all rendered useless. With no other choice, the factory had to spend an additional 3 million yuan to convert a warehouse into a factory, causing the production lines to be delayed in starting production. The factory still does not have a dedicated warehouse.

Advanced production equipment should be accompanied by advanced management, but the management chaos at JinYang Knitting Factory is shocking! After the two production lines were installed, from the end of 1985 to the beginning of 1986, a total of 3,640 suits were trial-produced. By June 1987, when an inventory was conducted, only 1,754 suits remained. Where did the other nearly 2,000 suits go? After extensive investigation, auditors found that 868 items were taken directly from workers without being entered into the inventory, and over 1,000 items were lent out on 39 blank receipts. Additionally, 515 suits are still unaccounted for. The factory's losses of fabric, raw materials, and other items are countless. Once, after the public security department apprehended a thief, the factory only realized that items were missing. In June of this year, the Provincial Audit Bureau inspected five types of finished products in the factory's finished product warehouse and material warehouse, and found that the accounts, physical items, and cards for all five types of products did not match, with the accounts always exceeding the physical items. In fact, the factory's audit director had repeatedly submitted written reports to the factory director, demanding rectification of these issues and loopholes. However, shortly afterward, the factory leadership decided to merge the audit department into the finance department, and the audit director was dismissed from his post.

Management chaos inevitably leads to waste. A boiler that was used for only a few months was, without approval from relevant departments, dismantled into scrap metal at the order of the factory leadership. This single incident resulted in a loss of approximately 10 million yuan.

Due to poor management and market changes, the two advanced production lines imported with a large amount of national foreign exchange could not achieve their intended benefits. In this situation, instead of finding ways to expand the market, update designs, and strengthen management, the factory leadership chose to sell the equipment. Currently, 23 imported machines from these two production lines, along with the original 36 domestically produced and imported machines, have all been sold. Of course, selling equipment alone is not enough for JinYang Knitting Factory to cope with its hundreds of millions of debt. Thus, selling land has become a means for the factory to sustain itself. According to incomplete statistics, the factory has sold land more than 10 times, totaling over 100 acres, amounting to hundreds of millions of yuan. Strangely, despite selling equipment and land to this extent, the factory's foreign debt continues to increase.

### 晋阳针织厂引进两条生产线的前前后后

　　晋阳针织厂引进两条生产线的前前后后
    晋阳针织厂贷款６８４万元人民币（其中外汇１２７万美元），引进两条生产线，其中一条西装生产线瘫痪了４年，部分机器挪作它用，部分机器尚未拆封。另一条无纺布生产线半瘫痪３年多，至今只是开开停停，实际生产能力只有设计能力的１／７。工厂因此负债累累，工人为之摇头叹息。现在，厂里每年光付利息就达六七十万元。这一恶果究竟是怎样造成的呢？
    通过了解，我们十分震惊地发现，有关部门在引进这么大的项目时，竟十分草率。有关人员在合同签订前，只有一个粗线条的引进设想。合同正式签订之后，有关部门才匆忙地开始搞作为合同签订根据的可行性研究。由于时间仓促，最终仍未搞出正式的可行性研究报告，只搞了个实施方案报批。请看下列事实：
    １９８４年４月２４日签订引进无纺布生产合同；６月１２日签订引进西装生产线合同；５月４日和６月２１日分别上报引进这两条生产线的实施方案；７月２日和７月５日由省经委分别批复。１０月３１日有关部门才派人去日本考察。
    请注意，合同签订后，就具有了法律效力，是不能随意更改的。但有关部门却是先签订合同，再上报实施方案，由上级批复，最后才去日本考察。然而，去考察的人还没有到日本，这两条生产线的大部分设备已按合同规定装箱启运了。由于可行性研究不足，引进设备未做严谨细致的论证，结果这些设备进厂后，人们才发现，不但原先计划装两条生产线的新建厂房只能装一条生产线，而且新建厂房的高度不够，无法安装设备。原为引进设备配套的空调、电缆、管道等辅助配套工程全部报废。没办法，厂里只好再耗资３０万元，将库房改建成厂房，致使生产线迟迟不能投产。厂里至今没有专用库房。
    先进的生产设备应有先进的管理，但晋阳针织厂管理混乱令人触目惊心！两条生产线进厂后，在１９８５年底至１９８６年初共试产西装３６４０套（件），到１９８７年６月核实清点时，仅剩１７５４套（件），其余近２０００套（件）哪里去了呢？审计的同志经过多方查找，发现不经入库，直接从工人手中提走的，就有８６８件，有１０００多件竟是用３９张白条借出的，还有５１５套（件）至今没有下落。厂里丢失布料、原料等其它物品更是不胜枚举。有一次公安部门将盗贼逮住之后，通知厂里，厂里才发现丢了东西。今年６月，省审计局派人抽查了这个厂成品库、材料库的５种成品，结果５种成品的帐、物、卡都不相符，都是帐多于物。其实，对这些问题和漏洞，厂审计科长曾不止一次地给厂长写了文字报告，要求整顿。然而不久，厂领导人决定把审计科并入财务科，审计科长被免去了职务。
    管理混乱必然导致浪费。一台只用了几个月的锅炉，未经有关部门审批，厂领导一句话，便把好端端的锅炉切割得七零八碎，几乎成了一堆废铁。仅此一项就造成约１０万元的损失。
    由于管理不善，加上市场变化，国家花巨额外汇引进的这两条先进生产线不能发挥应有的效益。在这种情况下，厂领导不是想办法开拓市场，更新设计，加强管理，而是变卖设备。现在，这两条生产线的２３台进口设备和原来的３６台国产和进口设备都已卖掉了。当然，光卖设备，晋阳针织厂还是不能应付数百万元的债务。于是，卖地又成了这个厂维持生计的手段。据不完全统计，这个厂已卖土地１０多次，共达１００多亩，金额数百万元。令人奇怪的是，尽管卖设备、卖土地，卖到今天这般光景，而这个厂的外债还是有增无减。
