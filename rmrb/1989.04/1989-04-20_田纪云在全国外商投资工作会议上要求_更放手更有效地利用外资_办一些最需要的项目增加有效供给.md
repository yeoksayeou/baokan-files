Tian Jiyun, Vice Premier of the State Council, said at the opening of the National Foreign Investment Work Conference today: "We must be more open and more effective in utilizing foreign investment, and push the work of attracting foreign investment to a higher level."

Over the past decade, China's work in attracting foreign investment has made initial progress. Currently, there are more than 16,000 approved foreign-invested enterprises nationwide, with foreign investment commitments reaching over $28 billion. Tian Jiyun called for combining the efforts of rectification and adjustment with the implementation of the coastal economic development strategy and the work of attracting foreign investment in the new situation. He pointed out that these efforts are not contradictory but rather mutually influential and promoting. Rectification and adjustment to solve problems in the domestic economy will fundamentally create better conditions for promoting openness and implementing the coastal economic development strategy. Meanwhile, the international economic and technological landscape is thriving, the international political environment is easing, and the global industrial structure and investment directions are adjusting, providing us with favorable development opportunities. He urged not to miss this opportunity. By attracting foreign investment, we can undertake some projects that suit China's industrial structure, make up for the shortage of domestic construction funds, and increase effective supply.

Tian Jiyun required each region to consider attracting foreign investment comprehensively based on local economic development needs and possibilities, make plans, and closely align with national industrial policies and local economic development plans. Coastal cities and economic special zones should pay attention to improving the technological level of projects. Attracting foreign investment should be both active and pragmatic, within our capabilities, and particularly focus on benefits, using limited funds and resources on the most needed projects. More efforts can be made on old enterprise renovation projects and wholly foreign-owned projects.

In continuing to improve the investment environment, Tian Jiyun particularly emphasized the importance of managing existing foreign-invested enterprises. Local governments and relevant departments should actively find ways to help enterprises solve existing difficulties. He said, improving the investment environment also requires maintaining the stability and continuity of policies. Policies and measures formulated by local governments and departments should not contradict national laws and regulations. In foreign affairs, we must keep our word and avoid changing policies frequently.

　　田纪云在全国外商投资工作会议上要求    
    更放手更有效地利用外资    
    办一些最需要的项目增加有效供给
    本报北京４月２０日讯  记者计泓赓、冯霄报道：国务院副总理田纪云在今天开幕的全国外商投资工作会议上说：“更放手更有效地利用外资，把吸引外商投资工作推向一个更高的水平。”
    １０年来我国吸收外商投资工作已初步打开局面。目前全国已批准的外商投资企业有１．６万多个，外商协议投资达２８０多亿美元。田纪云要求在新形势下，把治理、整顿与实施沿海经济发展战略和搞好吸收外商投资工作很好地结合起来。他指出，彼此不是对立的，而是相互影响、相互促进的。搞治理、整顿，解决国内经济生活中出现的问题，从根本上说将为推进对外开放和实施沿海经济发展战略更好地创造条件；而当前国际经济技术方兴未艾，国际政治环境趋于缓和，国际性产业结构及投资方向正在调整，也给我们提供了有利的发展机遇。他要求不要错过这个机遇。通过吸收外商投资，办一些符合我国产业结构的好项目，弥补国内建设资金不足，增加有效供给。　
    田纪云要求各地根据当地经济发展的需要和可能，对吸收外商投资有一个通盘考虑，作出规划，并要同国家的产业政策和本地的经济发展规划紧密结合，沿海大中城市和经济特区，应当注意提高项目的技术档次。吸收外商投资既要积极，又要实事求是，量力而为，特别是要讲求效益，把有限的资金、物资用到最需要的项目上。可以多搞一些老企业改造项目和外商独资项目。
    在继续抓紧改善投资环境上，田纪云特别强调办好现有外商投资企业，各地和各有关部门要积极想办法帮助企业解决存在的某些困难。他说，改善投资环境，还要注意保持政策的稳定性和连续性。各地方、各部门制定的政策措施，不能同国家公布的法律、法规相抵触。在涉外事务中，一定要言而有信，不能朝令夕改。
