Title: Job Hopping, Closures, and Industry Shifts – Economic Trends of Individual Businesses in Shaodong County, Hunan

The rapid rise of individual and private businesses in Shaodong County, once dubbed "Little Wenzhou" of Hunan, has seen a shift in the past half-year. The private economy is experiencing "three trends": some are attracted by favorable conditions elsewhere and "job hop" to new locations; some are washed out by the market and close down; others adjust their industries to pursue more profitable ventures.

**Favorable Conditions Drive Job Hopping**

As of early 1989, the county had 22,061 registered individual businesses with 33,794 people, a decrease of 43.9% and 36.9% respectively compared to the same period last year. Approximately 15,000 people have left the county to do business elsewhere. Over 300 private enterprises have relocated.

The main reason is that business owners want to escape the crowded and competitive environment in Shaodong to earn more money. In recent years, the county government has implemented favorable policies to develop individual and private economies, but these policies are less attractive compared to those in neighboring regions. A private enterprise owner in Huochangping candidly said, "A few years ago, I wanted to acquire a few hundred square meters of land to expand my factory, but it was never approved. When Hengyang heard about it, they immediately invited us to set up a factory and provided a spacious house. When I wanted to build a house, they also gave me land and building materials." He has since established three steel ball factories elsewhere, with an annual output value of over 500,000 yuan.

Additionally, some regions disregard national policies and regulations, illegally selling household registrations and exempting taxes, creating a strong pull. The county has over 1,500 people who have bought urban household registrations elsewhere. A business owner in Shengli Street revealed, "I have already bought an urban household registration in a certain place and acquired property. If the factory does not move there, what will happen?"

**Chaos Forces Closures**

Currently, about 9,000 individual businesses in the county have stopped operations or closed down. The main reasons for this are threefold: first, there is widespread arbitrary levies, fees, and fines. All hotels in the county had to pay a deposit of 500 yuan to renew their "special industry permits" within a deadline, and additional fines for late renewals; the number of individual businesses transporting sugarcane over long distances has decreased from over 20 last year to 7 this year, due to a sanitation fee of 1,000 yuan per car; the five individual freight forwarding stations in the county city have to pay a fine of 30 yuan to the urban management team for each vehicle loaded or unloaded in front of their stores. Currently, there are nearly 20 types of such fees, including various types of levies, stamp fees, agricultural support fees, and sanitation fees. Second, there is severe arbitrary taking and arrears. An individual business owner in Lingshan Temple Township gathered over 1,000 yuan to open a shop, but within less than a year, neighbors and local residents owed him 800 yuan, forcing him to close the shop. Similar situations are common. Third, individual business owners themselves lack business acumen and cannot handle the volatile market conditions. Some are heavily in debt and have to close their shops to seek other means of livelihood.

**Short-Sightedness Leads to Industrial Concentration**

Shaodong is known as the "hometown of a hundred trades." According to recent statistics, the trend of individual economy concentrating in industry has cooled down. This raises several concerns: first, business operations tend to be concentrated and monotonous, with few engaging in niche industries, and some traditional crafts like dyeing, tin-smithing, and home textile production are on the verge of disappearing. Second, the rush towards "hot" industries leads to blind investment and production, resulting in product backlog. Third, the scarcity of energy and raw materials forces business owners to seek materials through backdoors and connections, posing problems for social ethics and clean governance.

**Policy Doubts Lead to Excessive Consumption**

According to a survey, some individual business owners still have doubts about the policies. This is reflected in: first, the demand to operate under a collective banner to avoid being labeled as "new capitalists." Statistics show that the county has 75 collective and individual enterprises. Second, they feel that some policies lack relative stability, fearing to "eat regret pills." For example, the temporary closure of the grain market has had a strong impact on individual business owners, especially those in the catering industry. Again, as yellow flower fungus is a third-class agricultural product, the state allows for open operations. The county had some management loopholes in the past two years. Last year, the implementation of specialized management caused different degrees of setbacks for some individual business owners, who had to pay taxes on the yellow flower fungus they collected.

Doubts about policies have led some "millionaires" and even wealthy individuals to not use their funds for industrial development but instead to build villas, repair ancestral tombs, hold lavish weddings and funerals, purchase high-end goods, and compete in extravagance. The trend of comparing wealth, emphasizing consumption, and seeking enjoyment is on the rise, with some even spending money on gambling and prostitution.

### 跳槽·歇业·改行——湖南邵东县个体经济动向

　　跳槽·歇业·改行    
    ——湖南邵东县个体经济动向
    郑严石
    昔日个体工商业迅猛崛起，被冠以湖南“小温州”称号的邵东县，近半年来，私营经济出现“三股分流”，一部分受外地“优惠”条件的吸引，“跳槽”经营，一部分被大浪淘沙，歇业隐归；一部分调整行业，往赚钱热门挤。
    “优惠”拉动，“跳槽”经营
    １９８９年初，全县登记领照的个体户２２０６１户，３３７９４人，分别比上年同期减少４３．９％和３６．９％。约有１．５万人出县经营。私营企业已外流３００多家。
    究其原因，从经营者自身而言，是为跳出邵东拥挤和竞争激烈的小圈子，去挣更多的钱。近些年，该县政府为发展个体私营经济制定了优惠措施，但与相邻地区争相“优惠”的措施比较，反差强烈。火厂坪一私营企业主坦诚地说：“前些年，我想批几百平方米地皮扩建厂房，一直落实不了。衡阳知道后，马上请我们去办厂，给了一套宽敞的住房；我想修房，他们又给我批地皮和建材。”他已在外地办了３家钢球厂，年产值５０余万元。
    另外，一些地区无视国家政策、法规，非法出卖户口，乱免税等，形成一股强大的拉力。该县在外地买了城镇户口的就有１５００多人，两市镇胜利街一个个体企业主透露：“我已经在某地买了城镇户口，还购置了房产，如果厂子不搬过去，那边怎么办？”
    “三乱”横行，被迫歇业
    现在，该县个体工商业约有９０００人停业、歇业。促其隐归的主要原因有三：首先是社会上乱摊派，乱收费，滥罚款。该县所有的旅店业，在限期换发“特种行业许可证”时都要交足押金５００元，逾期不办另加罚金若干；从事长途贩运甘蔗的个体户已由去年的２０余家减到今年的７家，原因是每个车皮需缴卫生费１０００元。县城５家个体货物托运站，每在店门前装卸一车货物，都要向城管队缴纳３０元罚金。目前诸如各类抽金、盖章费、贴农金、卫生费等多达近２０种。其次是白拿、赊欠等严重。灵山寺乡某个体户拼凑千余元资金开办商店，营业不到一年时间，就被左邻右舍、当地群众赊欠货款８００元，不得不关门停业。类似情况，随处都有。
    再次，个体户自身经营素质差，把握不住大起大落的市场行情。一部分人负债累累，不得不关店歇业另谋生计。
    只顾眼前，涌向工业
    邵东素称百工之乡，据最近统计，个体经济向工业集中的“热”劲下降。这带来几点忧虑：一、经营趋向集中，趋向单调，经营冷门行业的为数寥寥，个别项目濒于失传，如染坊、补锅、家庭纺织等。二、大家涌向“热门”，一哄而上，盲目建厂投产，造成产品积压。三、僧多粥少，能源和原材料紧缺，大部分私营企业严重开工不足。这样一来，迫使经营者千方百计走后门，拉关系，到处搞原材料，又给社会风气、为政清廉带来问题。
    疑虑过重，消费至上
    据调查，个体户中一部分人对政策仍存疑虑。表现在：一是要求挂集体招牌经营，怕今后划“新兴资本家”。据统计，全县有７５家集体和个体的企业。二是感到某些政策缺少相对稳定性，怕吃“后悔药”。如粮食市场的一度关闭，使个体户、尤其是饮食业受到强烈冲击。再如黄花菜属于三类农副产品，国家允许放开经营。该县前两年因管理方面的原因出现过一些漏洞。去年实行归口专营，一些个体户因此而受到不同程度的挫折，个体户收购的黄花菜被迫征收。
    对政策的疑虑，使得一些“万元户”乃至“殷富户”，不是把资金用于发展产业，而是热衷于砌洋房、修祖坟，大操大办红白喜事，购置高档商品，赛阔气。比排场、讲消费、图享受之风日盛，少数人甚至把钱花在嫖赌上。
