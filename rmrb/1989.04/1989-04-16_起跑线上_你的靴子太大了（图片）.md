On the Starting Line
– Your Boots Are Too Big

(Sun Yizeng, April 1st, Beijing Daily)

The cartoon depicts a figure standing on a starting line, wearing oversized boots. The boots are so large that they impede the figure's ability to run effectively. This visual metaphor suggests that the figure is burdened by something that is too big for them to handle, symbolizing the challenges or obstacles that might hinder progress or success.

The cartoon is a commentary on the challenges faced by individuals or a society when they take on responsibilities or roles that are beyond their current capabilities. The oversized boots represent the burdens or expectations that can slow down or prevent forward movement. The message is clear: it is important to assess one's abilities and responsibilities carefully to ensure that they are manageable and conducive to progress.
