About 1,000 members of the Portuguese Public Security Police held a rally outside the Ministry of the Interior on April 21st, demanding that the government recognize the legality of police unions.

After the rally, these police officers held a march, but their procession was blocked by another police unit—the "riot police." The riot police used water cannons and police dogs. Clashes broke out between the "riot police" and the "marching police," resulting in several injuries.
