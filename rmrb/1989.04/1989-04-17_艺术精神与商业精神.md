Title: The Spirit of Art and the Spirit of Commerce

The inevitable reform of the arts system has forced dancers to consider not only the pursuit of "artistic spirit" but also the "spirit of commerce."

Are "artistic spirit" and "commercial spirit" necessarily opposed? In studying ancient Chinese musical and dance thought, I am puzzled by why Han Fei would link "long sleeves dancing well, much money trading well" together. Dancing well is the essence of artistic spirit; trading well is the essence of commercial spirit. As far as I know, Han Fei, who advocated "governing by law," despised both "dance" and "trade." However, earlier than Han Fei, the two major schools of thought in the pre-Qin period, Confucianism and Mohism, each had their own perspectives: Confucius "composed music," seeking not only beauty but also goodness, so when he heard the music of *Shao*, he "forgot the taste of meat for three months." Mozi "opposed music," seeking not only truth but also profit, so he advocated "promoting the benefits of the world" and opposed the "elaborate" and "extravagant" nature of rituals and music. Just as Confucius did not mention whether the perfectly beautiful *Shao* could be used for profit, Mozi did not mention whether the "benefits of the world" could be sought through music and dance. Of course, neither of them said that "perfect beauty" is a kind of "benefit" or that the "benefits of the world" are beauty and goodness.

A Western philosopher believes that human spiritual activities have two forms: theoretical and practical. Theoretical spiritual activities are further divided into intuitive and logical, while practical spiritual activities are divided into economic and ethical. These four spiritual activities correspond to the four basic categories of beauty, truth, profit, and goodness, and the disciplines that study them are aesthetics, logic, economics, and ethics, respectively. If Confucius and Mozi, or their later followers, could have complemented each other, we would not be hesitating between "artistic spirit" and "commercial spirit" today. Confucius's emphasis on intuition and ethics, and Mozi's logical and economic views, why did they have to fight to the death? But history exiled Mozi, exiled "truth" and "profit," and brought in Laozi and Zhuangzi's "Dao" and Confucius and Mencius's "Confucianism" to complement each other, and the debate between beauty, goodness, and truth, profit gave way to the discussion of "self-cultivation" and "benefiting others."

"Dancing well" and "trading well" are two different things, and "long sleeves" and "much money" are like "chalk and cheese." At least, the "ritual and music" system of the pre-Qin period, the "Yuefu" institution of the Han Dynasty, the "wandering in the world" style of the Jin people, and the "softening of distant peoples" intention of the Tang people were like this. But even so, our nation is not the first time facing the choice of both "dancing well" and "trading well." The performances of the singing and dancing artists of the Song Dynasty—"Luguiren" in the "Waci" and "Goulan" were imbued with the "spirit of commerce," and this "spirit of commerce" led to a major reform of the "artistic spirit" of dance—dance transformed from a noble art to a folk art.

Dancers broke free from personal dependence and began to pursue an independent personality.

We have a long-standing bias called "Why bother with profit," believing that using "dance" for "trade" will lower the status of dance and even the dignity of dancers. But I believe that those who pay to see "long sleeves" are not necessarily of low taste, just as those who receive tickets to receive "model" education are not necessarily of high moral character. I still believe in the ancient saying, "The love of beauty is universal." The "long sleeves" of dancers are not necessarily unrelated to "much money." Don't rush to blame the audience for not loving beauty; instead, reflect on the distance between your concept of "beauty" and the audience's perception of "beauty."

### 艺术精神与商业精神

　　艺术精神与商业精神
　　·于平·
    势在必行的文艺体制改革，使舞蹈家们不得不在孜孜以求的“艺术精神”之外，稍稍兼顾一下“商业精神”了。
    “艺术精神”与“商业精神”必然对立吗？在中国古代乐舞思想的学习中，我就纳闷韩非何以要把“长袖善舞，多钱善贾”结为一联。善舞者，艺术精神之所在也；善贾者，商业精神之所在也。而据我所知，游说“以法治国”的韩非是既嫌弃“舞”也讨厌“贾”的。不过，早于韩非的先秦两大显学儒、墨都是各执一端：孔子“作乐”，不仅求美，而且趋善，所以一闻《韶》乐“三月不知肉味”。墨子“非乐”，不仅求真，而且逐利，所以为“兴天下之利”，反对礼乐的“繁饰”、“盛为”。正如孔子没有讲“尽善尽美”的《韶》可否用去逐利，墨子也没有讲“天下之利”可否用乐舞以求。当然，两人也都没有说“尽善尽美”便是一种“利”或“天下之利”便是美与善。
    一位西方哲学家认为，人的精神活动具有两种形式：理论的和实践的。理论的精神活动又分为直觉的和逻辑的，实践的精神活动又分为经济和伦理的。这四种精神活动对应于美、真、利、善四个基本范畴，研究它们的学科分别是美学、逻辑学、经济学和伦理学。本来，孔、墨或其后学如果能互为补充，我们今天也就不至于徘徊于“艺术精神”与“商业精神”之间而左右为难。孔子的重直觉、重伦理与墨子的逻辑观、经济观有何必要闹个你死我活呢？但历史还是放逐了墨子，放逐了“真”与“利”，拉来个老、庄之“道”与孔、孟之“儒”互补，美、善与真、利之辩让位与“独善”与“兼济”之谈。
    “善舞”与“善贾”是两码事，“长袖”与“多钱”更是“风马牛”。至少，先秦的“礼乐”制度，两汉的“乐府”机构，晋人的“游世”之风和唐人的“柔远”之意便是如此。但即使这样，我们民族也不是第一次面临既要“善舞”又要“善贾”的抉择。宋代的歌舞艺人——“路歧人”在“瓦肆”、“勾栏”中的表演就是具有“商业精神”的，而这一“商业精神”却引起了舞蹈的“艺术精神”的重大变革——舞蹈由贵族的艺术变成了平民的艺术。
    舞蹈家摆脱了人身依附而开始追求独立人格。
    我们有一种传世的偏见，叫做“何必曰利”，认为以“舞”作“贾”会降低舞蹈的品格以至舞蹈家的人格。但我却认为，花钱看“长袖”者未必格调低下，正如拿着赠券去受“样板”教育的观众未必品格高尚一样。我还是相信“爱美之心，人皆有之”这句古话，舞蹈家的“长袖”未必完全与“多钱”无缘，先不要急于责怪观众不爱美，而不妨反省一下你那个“美”的理式与观众的“美”的感想之间的距离。
