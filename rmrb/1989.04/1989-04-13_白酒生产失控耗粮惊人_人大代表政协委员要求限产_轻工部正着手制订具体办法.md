Uncontrolled white liquor production has sparked strong dissatisfaction among the people nationwide. During the recently concluded National People's Congress (NPC) and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) sessions, some deputies and members passionately called for limiting white liquor production. Their appeals have already drawn the attention of the Ministry of Light Industry.

Today, reporters from this newspaper and Xinhua News Agency saw that among the 75 proposals and motions forwarded from the "Two Sessions," one-fifth are calling for limiting white liquor production. These proposals and motions believe that the harm caused by uncontrolled white liquor production has reached a level where it must be controlled. In 1980, China's white liquor production was 2.15 million tons. By 1987, this had doubled to over 430 million tons, and in 1988, it surged to nearly 500 million tons. If we calculate that each kilogram of white liquor consumes 2.5 kilograms of grain (in reality, some liquor factories consume more than this standard), then last year, white liquor production consumed 125 million tons of grain. This is equivalent to the monthly grain ration for 800 million people. Last year, China imported approximately 15 million tons of grain. This means that more than 80% of the grain imported with a large amount of foreign exchange was used for making liquor.

It is understood that relevant state departments proposed control measures for white liquor production several years ago and issued official documents, but in recent years, not only have these measures not been effective, but the more they are controlled, the more the production increases, and the more production factories there are. According to statistics from the Ministry of Light Industry, there are more than 50,000 liquor factories nationwide, but in reality, there are more than 40,000 white liquor production factories. A 1987 survey in Sichuan Province alone found more than 10,000 large and small white liquor factories, and there are more than 200 in Mili County, Anhui Province.

The Ministry of Light Industry attaches great importance to the proposals and motions from the "Two Sessions" and has instructed relevant departments to seriously study and quickly formulate specific restrictive measures.

　　白酒生产失控耗粮惊人
　　人大代表政协委员要求限产
　　轻工部正着手制订具体办法
    本报北京4月12日讯　本报记者刘桂莲、新华社记者杨理科报道：无节制的白酒生产已经引起全国人民的强烈不满。在刚刚结束的全国人大、政协会议上，部分代表、委员慷慨陈词，要求限制白酒生产。他们的呼吁已引起轻工业部的重视。
    记者今天在轻工业部办公厅看到“两会”转来的75件建议和提案中，有1／5是要求限制白酒生产的。这些提案和建议认为，白酒无节制生产的危害已经到了非控制不可的程度。1980年我国的白酒产量 215万吨，1987年就翻番到430多万吨，1988年又猛增到近500万吨。若按每公斤白酒消耗2.5公斤粮食计算（实际上一些酒厂的消耗量大于这个标准），去年白酒消耗粮食达1250万吨，这相当于八亿人口一个月的口粮。而去年，我国进口的粮食大约1500万吨。也就是说，花大量外汇进口的粮食80％以上用于造酒了。
    据了解，国家有关部门几年前就对白酒生产提出过控制措施，并发了红头文件，但近年来非但没有见效，反而越控制产量越大，生产厂家越多。据轻工部统计，全国现有酒厂50000多家，而实际上白酒生产厂已超过4万家，仅四川省1987年调查就有大小白酒厂10000多家，安徽省毫县也有200多家。
    轻工业部对“两会”的提案及建议非常重视，已责成有关部门认真研究，迅速做出具体限制办法。
