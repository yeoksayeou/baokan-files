The wheel of history has turned for 60 years. Jinggangshan, this majestic mountain, has stepped from one era into another with heavy strides.

In the past, tens of thousands of young men from the Jinggangshan region joined the Red Army to overthrow the old world, bidding farewell to their hometowns' mountains and fields, fighting in all directions, and facing death nine times out of ten. The outstanding ones became excellent leaders and revolutionary heroes of the Republic.

When the tide of reform and opening up swept across the country in the 1980s, it was also in this region under Jinggangshan, in the villages and towns where the predecessors had set out, that tens of thousands of mountain girls, organized by the local government, left their mountain strongholds as exported labor, heading towards the coastal special economic zones.

"Cuckoo flies to the southeast." The impact of the commodity economy wave and the baptism of modern industrial civilization will bring what to Jinggangshan and its girls?

When the Civil Affairs Department team led by Cui Jinming arrived in Yongxin and Ninggang in late 1986 to carry out poverty alleviation and economic development work, their first impression was the stark contrast between the poverty of the old revolutionary base area and the era.

While the coastal regions had already seen the emergence of millionaires and the surge in rural industrial and commercial activities, this once-revolutionary base area was still struggling on the poverty line.

The team approached Jinggangshan with a "pilgrimage" spirit of reverence. However, they did not expect to see that the descendants of the old Red Guards in this area shared one quilt among four family members in winter, with only one person going out to work while the other three huddled in the bed all day. Entering a peasant's home, lifting the pot lid, they saw boiled pumpkin in clear water, and the stove had not seen oil stains for many days. They also did not expect to see that nearly a quarter of the children here had no money to go to school, a third of the young and strong were illiterate, and eight or nine-year-old children were already hunchbacked from carrying firewood up the mountain. Standing in the Xiang-Gan Revolutionary Memorial Hall in Yongxin County, facing the list of more than 8,000 martyrs, Cui Jinming shed tears: On this land soaked with the blood of martyrs, why is the fruit of victory so bitter? The five-hundred-li Jinggangshan ignited the spark of the Chinese revolution but did not uproot and burn the poverty of its own feet.

When modern civilization had already taken big strides into China, here was still a forgotten corner. Living in poverty with simplicity. "Two months of New Year, three months of farming, seven months of gambling," the traditional way of life was deeply rooted. The closed and narrow-minded psychology instinctively rejected science and culture. The local area had resources, and the team mobilized to set up some processing plants. "Sure, bring the money!" The state allocated more than 7 million yuan in aid to Yongxin County each year, but the body lacked the ability to "produce blood," and the factories could only ask for money without knowing how to use it, so the efficiency was naturally miserable. Promoting hybrid rice, training classes were held for several sessions, but there were still quite a few people who did not want to plant it: "Can this kind of rice produce more grain? I've never seen it!" Every economic development measure of the team had to use great effort to enlighten. A poor mountain valley that could not even eat three meals a day still thought of itself as a sacred "Garden of Eden." More than 70% of the villages had no electricity. When night fell, the mountains and fields were silent. Early to work and early to rest, drink a bowl of porridge, wash feet and go to bed. What does the outside world look like? They didn't know. Occasionally going to the county town was like going abroad. How many people had never seen a city, never seen an electric light, and even never heard the roar of machinery?

Cui Jinming couldn't help but think of the old Comrade Mao. The dense and towering mountains and valleys in the middle section of the Luoxiao Mountains were indeed the ideal place for armed struggle. But now, in the 1980s, closing the door and guarding the home in the vast sea of the commodity economy would surely be abandoned and eliminated. The backwardness of Jinggangshan was mainly the backwardness of ideas. If the labor force was confined to one place and one industry, how could economic development be achieved?

Open the gates of the mountain strongholds and let the spring breeze of reform and opening up blow in! Less than half a year after the team entered the mountains, they made a bold decision: to organize labor exports in an organized manner, to organize the surplus labor force here, and to go to the coastal special economic zones to work. Increasing income was one aspect, but more importantly, through labor exports, the traditional ideas of the old areas could be impacted, and the old areas and the special economic zones, the two poles of modern China, could be connected.

The special economic zones needed female workers. A large number of joint ventures and "three-in-one" enterprises needed labor.

Recruitment advertisements were posted in every village. The peaceful rural homes were stirred up. As the director, the team had fully optimistic expectations for the climax and ending of this play. However, they did not expect that as soon as the curtain was raised, the stage lights suddenly dimmed.

"Only heard of selling goods, but never heard of selling people!" "Only want girls to go, afraid they will be sent to the disabled as wives!" "Going out to work, can the girls still get married?"

Rumors spread like wildfire. The mountain valleys were usually cut off from information, but strangely, groundless doubts and criticisms of new things spread through various channels, and the speed was fast, and the coverage was wide, often surpassing modern communication methods.

The team, which had hoped to impact traditional ideas through labor exports, did not expect to be hit hard by traditional ideas. "Human traffickers," the team was secretly given this "crown."

Cui Jinming was resolute: "Never mind, send one if there is one, send ten if there are ten. The girls who go out will speak for themselves!"

Going to Shenzhen to work, according to the labor contract, after three months of apprenticeship, one can earn 120 to 150 yuan per month on average. Hesitation, doubt, and indecision, but the prestige of the Revolutionary Martyrs was unshakable. A group of people, fearing to miss the opportunity to get rich, still decided to send their daughters to sign up.

"Going out must have a full bowl of rice to eat! The team is sent by the Communist Party, will they kidnap all the girls?"

"Go, maybe you can earn a few hundred yuan in a year! That year, if I had followed the Red Army, I would have either died as a martyr or become an official by now, and I wouldn't have spent my life turning over the soil!"

On October 8, 1987, the first batch of 445 girls who signed up in Ninggang County gathered in the county town to set off. They were dressed in new clothes, carrying bedrolls and travel bags, and gathered excitedly in the Longshi Square where Mao Zedong and Zhu De once met. The girls' hearts were filled with joy, as if they had discovered for the first time their special position and value in this world, and they were full of longing and hope for the new life ahead. The parents, however, were all tearful, with countless admonitions and instructions, as if it were a permanent separation. The small county of more than 8,000 people had never been so lively. Each township formed a team, and two teams shared a large bus, with the township heads leading the way. The county leaders and urban residents all came to see them off. The sound of sobbing and laughter intertwined, forming a cacophony of noise.

The wheels turned. A flock of young birds flew south in formation. Unlike their predecessors who went out to fight, there was no war, no gunpowder, but in their hearts, this was no less than a "Long March" away from home.

From Jinggangshan to Shenzhen, the geographical distance was only about five or six hundred kilometers, but for the girls, it was as if they had suddenly come from one world to another. The bustling city, the high-rise buildings, the dazzling neon lights... everything was so unfamiliar and novel, making them feel dizzy.

Only a small part of the Jinggangshan girls entered the factories in Shenzhen, and most of them were scattered in the suburbs of Zhongshan, Maogang, and Ba'an County's Xin'an and Longgang. The factories were generally not large, with two or three hundred, four or five hundred people, and some had only a hundred or so. They mainly produced electronic components, plastic toys, knitting, and metal parts. Every day, they worked on the assembly line, with their hands and eyes never resting. Lunch was only half an hour, and after eating, they continued to work. A day was at least eight hours, and sometimes ten or twelve hours. High frequency, full load, fast pace, the girls lived like tightly wound springs, and they couldn't take it after a few days: "Mom, even carrying firewood up the mountain is not as tiring as this, and there's no rest!" "Sitting all day, my waist is about to break, this money is not worth earning!"

In life, every little thing felt uncomfortable and unaccustomed. Eating, no chili, how can this be eaten! In the mountains, they would eat as soon as they got up in the morning, otherwise, they wouldn't have the strength to work. But now, no factory provides breakfast, if you want to eat, go to the street to have early tea! Can that tea fill the stomach? A bread costs one yuan, and after eating three, it still feels not full. Might as well not eat breakfast, save the money, and go to work with an empty stomach. After a day's work, the body was tired, and the body was dirty, wanting to take a bath but there was no hot water, only "shower." The cold water poured on the skin, chilling to the bone, and the heart was frozen.

When they first came, almost no girl thought this place was better than the mountains. Being constrained and supervised, all day under the watchful eyes of the boss and the foreman, everywhere they went, they were a bit nervous. Spit on the ground, fined. The girls were angry: "It didn't spit on you, and you still have to manage this!" Three minutes late for work, sorry, the punch card machine is closed, don't work for the day. Some girls in the family were used to getting up when the sun was on their butts every day, and for the first time, they were late by a minute and were locked out, crying and squatting on the ground.

The night was the hardest to endure. The double-decker iron bed, the upper bunk was afraid of falling down, and the lower bunk always felt that the upper bunk would collapse. Outside, the neon lights were dazzling, the night market's hawking and the music from the dance halls and teahouses never stopped, the endless flow of car horns and machine noises roared all night, tossing and turning, unable to sleep. The nights in the hometown were so wonderful, the curtain fell, the mountains slept, the forests slept, the birds slept, only the mountain spring water flowed gently, and that sound was also pleasant and intoxicating. The girls' hearts were still in the mountains.

Yesterday in the old area, today in the special zone; yesterday still a peasant, today a worker. Such a big leap in change was like a rebirth for the girls. The huge contrast in life easily induced psychological resistance. Once the initial curiosity and novelty disappeared, the discomfort with the new life turned into resentment and resistance. A group of girls wavered and wanted to retreat. One person took the lead, ten people responded; ten people left, more people followed. They came with determination, but left with desperation. Like the ebb and flow of the tide, they came in a rush and left in a rush. Before they could complete the three-month apprenticeship, those who left in groups accounted for nearly one-third.

But don't underestimate this one-third. When they returned to the mountains and saw their relatives, their tears and snot were the most seductive. Although there was no evidence of "becoming a prostitute" or "marrying a disabled person," the stories of not being able to eat, not being able to sleep, and being locked in an iron door to work all day were exaggerated and spread quickly.

"Have you seen the girl from the front mountain? She's so thin, only skin and bones!" "It's a sin! Sitting all day without moving, even going to the toilet is not allowed!"

The team was preparing to organize the second and third batches, and those who had signed up had their forms taken back. Some girls who went and didn't return wrote letters to urge them, some went to bring them back, and more often went to the team's office to argue, demanding the return of the girls.

Ninggang County sent six large buses to Shenzhen, and the leading cadres had just settled the girls in the factories when they returned with a full car of people. More than a hundred girls crowded around the car, arguing and crying, insisting on returning to the mountains. The car seemed to be the only lifeboat in the turbulent sea, and countless hands reached out to it, desperate to escape from death. The leading cadres shouted: "Don't push, don't push! You've only been here for a few days and want to go back, how can you face your family!"

"Don't mind your own business, just let us go back!"

"This money is not worth earning, go back to farm!"

The mountain people are stubborn. Once they make up their minds, even eight horses can't pull them back.

Now, the few thousand girls who remain in Shenzhen, which one of them hasn't secretly cried in the quilt? Which one of them hasn't gone through repeated and intense ideological struggles before standing firm in the special zone? Breaking through traditional ideas requires courage. Adapting to modern new life also requires perseverance.

The open labor market in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, migrant workers came from all over the country. The thick local sentiment inevitably formed "gangs." And among all the "gangs," the girls from Jinggangshan were famous for their iron-like unity and "combat effectiveness." "We are from Jinggangshan!" They did not hide their pride in their hometown. The lights of Baojiao Tower, the martyrs' tomb in Xiaoping, the red maples in Sanwan, and the cannon fire at Huangyangjie were the topics that the mountain girls liked to talk about with outsiders. Each of them could tell the stories of Comrade Mao and General Zhu vividly, as if they had been there themselves.

In the Longgang Industrial Zone, there were 20,000 migrant workers from outside, and more than 2,000 were from Jinggangshan. They organized themselves by factory, established labor groups, and elected group leaders. No matter which township or village you were from, you were originally unfamiliar with each other in the mountains, but now you were all close sisters. The group leader called, and they came immediately, and they went immediately when dismissed. In the streets of Longgang Town, there was a management station for migrant workers from the Jinggangshan region. Although it was only a room of a dozen square meters with two staff members, the girls naturally regarded it as "home." They would come to sit and chat, laughing and talking about their hometown. During festivals, the management station also organized some collective cultural and entertainment activities, such as visits and evening parties, and the girls were very enthusiastic. A mid-autumn festival party in Longgang even attracted 6,000 to 7,000 people to participate, just to catch a glimpse of the mountain girls' charm. Such a labor organization was unique to the girls from Jinggangshan, making them even more noticeable.

Whether it was genetic factors at work, the mountain girls were as stubborn and competitive as their predecessors. Working in the Huaguang Electronics Co., Ltd. in Shenzhen, they installed screws in the recorder chassis every day, with a quota of 300. Fourteen girls from Jinggangshan all exceeded the quota every day, and the most skilled could install up to 1,200. The boss treated them differently, and the girls from other places couldn't help but feel jealous. The girls said: "They say Jinggangshan is poor, but we don't serve that breath, let them see that everyone from Jinggangshan is capable!"

The staff of the post office in Zhongshan Town talked about the girls from Jinggangshan: "The girls from the mountains are really good at saving money. They save on food and send even the smallest amount of money back home. They send not just money, but their hearts!" They recalled the scene when the girls from Jinggangshan first came to remit money: holding the money tightly in their hands, counting it over and over again, fearing that they had sent one less. They had never filled out a remittance form, didn't know how to write the amount in capital letters, and wrote it stroke by stroke, as if they were not writing but carving. The money and the remittance form were handed in through the window, and they stared at it for a long time, unwilling to leave: "Will it be received?" "How many days?" "Make sure it is delivered to my home!"

The mountain was poor, and one labor force could earn only 200 to 300 yuan a year, including the conversion of grain, but here they could earn it in two months. "Big Yuan" notes, most of the girls had never touched them before! The first time they received their salary, the money was placed in the pocket close to their chest, and even their hearts felt warm. To earn more money, the girls from Jinggangshan never spared their efforts. They worked overtime on weekends or holidays, earning two or three Hong Kong dollars per hour, which the local workers were not willing to do, but the girls from Jinggangshan fought for it. They hoped that their income would be higher than others, and the more they earned, the more they felt proud. The understanding of the value of money was self-taught in a commodity economy society.

Both Yongxin and Ninggang had the saying "one girl goes out, feeds a whole family." According to statistics, the total income from labor exports in the Jinggangshan region exceeded 4.6 million yuan per year, with an average annual income of 2,000 to 2,500 yuan per person. If a girl sends back 1,000 yuan to her family in a year, with a family of five, the per capita income would increase by 200 yuan, and even the poorest households would not have difficulty solving the problem of basic subsistence.

During the Spring Festival, Wang Xianglan returned to her hometown, which she had not seen for a long time. The car could not go any further in Gaoxi Township, and she carried a fashionable travel bag, hurrying along the familiar mountain paths, taking three steps for every two. She reached the village entrance, passed the threshing ground, and saw her own thatched cottage. Her mother was scattering grain to feed the chickens, and she glanced at her from a distance without saying a word. Her father was sitting on a stone stool weaving a bamboo basket, looking up at her blankly, not recognizing her.

Xianglan's eyes were wet. Daughter, you've been gone for less than two years, and you don't recognize me?

"Ah, silly girl, I thought you were a team member! Look at this outfit, so fashionable, who would have thought it was my Xianglan!" She had changed, indeed. Xianglan had grown taller and plump, and she had become more elegant. When she went to Shenzhen, she had two small braids, but now she had a perm? A gunmetal blue ski jacket with a hood, tight-fitting blue jeans that made her buttocks round and plump, ugly!

The neighbors heard the news and ran over, staring at the girl like an alien, surprised, envious, and various kinds of eyes scanning the girl's body, Xianglan blushed and was embarrassed for a moment.

A girl changes a lot in eighteen years. It was not just Xianglan; look at the girls from the mountains who are now in Shenzhen, one by one, dressed and made up, they seemed like different people. Fashionable but not extravagant, elegant but not luxurious, without heavy makeup, but still graceful. The rustic air of the mountain people was gone, and they were a group of "blue-collar beauties."

Zhu Meiyu returned to Longyuankou and stayed for five days, but she refused to stay any longer. It was not that she did not miss her hometown or was not affectionate to her parents. The fast-paced life and high-efficiency work had tempered her for two years, and she found it hard to adapt to the leisurely and scattered life of the rural home when she returned to the mountains. "Oh, there's no electricity at night, why go to bed so early?" "It's boring to death, sitting in the house all day with nothing to do!" This 18-year-old girl had falsely reported her age by two years before going to Shenzhen. She spent her crucial years of growth in the factories of the special zone, and new ideas were easily accepted. Modern consciousness accompanied modern industrial production, quietly changing the mountain girls.

A county magistrate from Ninggang County took several cadres to Shenzhen to visit the girls this year. At the Lianmei Shoe Factory, they were unexpectedly "checked" by several girls. The magistrate smoked "Zhonghua" cigarettes, and the girls laughed, taking out a pack of "Health" cigarettes and throwing them over: "Hey, magistrate, you're a big official and still smoke this kind of cigarette!" The magistrate asked how much they earned per month, and a girl named Xiao Yeyu clapped her hands and jumped up: "Anyway, more than you earn, the county magistrate is not as good as us working girls, ha—!" The magistrate's face turned red with embarrassment. In the past, the mountain girls would hide far away when they saw the county magistrate, but now they were so bold!

The stage of life for the mountain girls was just at the intersection of the old area and the special zone, peasants and workers, and once they overcame the initial discomfort and psychological resistance, they quickly showed great enthusiasm for the new life.

At first, the girls didn't go anywhere, and after work, they would rather stay in the dormitory to chat about their hometown. A batch of girls from Yongxin who went out to work passed by Guangzhou, and the car stopped in front of the first-class China Hotel. The leader called for them to get off and take a look, but many girls were indifferent: "What's there to see? Our mountains are more beautiful!" While waiting for the car, they even sat inside and played cards. But modern life was still attractive. After staying in the special zone for a few months, they still didn't know what Shenzhen City looked like, and the girls from Jinggangshan's hearts moved. Someone took the lead, and later, on holidays, the girls went to Shenzhen in groups. Wow, this was the big world! The towering buildings, the bustling streets, the mountains could not compare! Standing in front of the CITIC Plaza, they looked up to count how many floors it had, their necks ached, the sunlight dazzled their eyes, and they were still arguing about whether it was fifty-four or fifty-three floors. Two girls working in the sock factory in Zhongshan Head took a taxi to sightsee on National Day. After a tour of Shenzhen, they spent twenty-five yuan. Some people clicked their tongues, but the two girls were extremely happy: "Twenty-five yuan is worth it, we saw everything on this trip!"

A group of girls working in Longgang agreed to go see the sea. Each person contributed six yuan, chartered a large bus, and drove dozens of kilometers just to see what the sea looked like! "We're here, we're here, I see the sea!" A girl shouted first. Before the car stopped, they rushed down like a swarm of bees, running towards the sea in a drunken and crazy manner. They took photos on the beach, picked up shells and snails on the shore, danced and sang. Some even went barefoot into the water, facing the waves of the tide that surged towards them. From the natural mountains to the natural sea, from the secluded valleys to the vast ocean, the girls' hearts, like the sea water under the sun, shimmered with golden light.

The girls sent photos of the seaside back home. It was said that a girl's photo was torn up by her father on the spot. She was wearing a bright red swimsuit standing on the beach. Her father scolded: "You've gone wild. Crazy and crazy, what a sight!"

A few girls went south, bringing unprecedented changes to the old revolutionary base area of Jinggangshan. Not only did the peasant families increase their income, but the girls also saw the world and were tempered. More importantly and more profoundly, labor exports stirred up the entire old area's economy and life.

A closed loop was broken, and the chain began to recombine.

In the past, Yongxin and Ninggang had almost no township enterprises, and some townships did not even have one enterprise. In the past two years, every township has set up a batch of new factories, and the more impoverished townships, the more enthusiastic they were about industrial development. According to statistics from the Civil Affairs Department team, there were 23 new enterprises introduced in the Jinggangshan region. Capital and technology input were the twin of labor exports. A few girls in the special zone, while working, also acted as mediators for economic development. Some shrewd Hong Kong businessmen came to Jinggangshan. The vast tracts of cheap land and the large number of cheap labor here were obviously very attractive.

The girls from Jinggangshan who went out to work had a broader vision and also planned to return home to start a business with others. A girl from Ninggang is still working in a hardware and electrical appliance factory in Shenzhen, but she already has "ambitions": "When I return to the mountains, I will also set up a hardware and electrical appliance factory. This is not difficult, the key is to learn the technology and management first." Where will the capital come from? She smiled and replied: "Partner with someone! I still have to work here for a few more years, and when I have saved enough money, I will say goodbye to this place!"

Doing business is easier than setting up a factory, and a little capital is enough. The girls went to Shenzhen in batches from Jinggangshan, and from Shenzhen to Jinggangshan, coming and going, initially all empty-handed, but later most of them carried some "goods." Clothes, shoes, plastic toys... from Shenzhen could be seen everywhere in the markets in this area. Last year during the New Year, Shenzhen brought the news that melon seeds were sold for 3.5 yuan, while the highest price in Jinggangshan was only 1.5 yuan. The girls who went to Shenzhen all carried melon seeds, and although the business was small, they earned back the round-trip fare. Some girls "stayed" in Shenzhen, and the connection between Jinggangshan and Shenzhen became closer, with buses to Chaoling and Yiyang to transfer trains full of people every day. Those who went purely for sightseeing were few, and most of them were doing business. Labor exports also drove the circulation of goods, and this chain reaction was beyond the team's expectations.

Jinggangshan, under the influence of the girls, finally opened the gates of the mountain strongholds to the outside world.

　　井冈妹子〔报告文学〕
    杨西璘
    历史的车轮辗转行进了６０年。井冈山，这巍峨的山，迈着沉重的步伐，从一个时代走进了另一个时代。
    当年，井冈山地区几十万热血男儿，为了推翻旧世界加入了红军，告别了家乡的山野和田园，南征北战，九死一生。佼佼者成了共和国优秀的将领和革命元勋。
    当８０年代改革开放的大潮呼啸卷来的时候，也是在这井冈山下，在这当年前辈出征的乡街村头，有成千上万的山里妹子，在当地政府的组织下，作为输出的劳工，走出山寨，奔向了沿海特区。
    “孔雀东南飞”。商品经济浪潮的冲击和现代工业文明的洗礼，将给井冈山和它的妹子们带来些什么？
    当１９８６年底崔进明率领民政部赴井冈山地区扶贫经济开发工作团进驻永新和宁冈时，他们的第一个感受，就是老区的贫困和时代的反差出人意外地强烈。
    当沿海地区农村已经出现腰缠万贯的富翁，发达地区农民办厂开店风起云涌，而这个曾经养育了中国革命的根据地，却还在贫困线上挣扎。
    工作团是怀着一种“朝圣”的虔诚心情踏上井冈山的土地的。但是，他们没有想到，这里老赤卫队员的后代一家四口冬天共盖一条棉被，只能一人出门干活，三人整天蜷缩在床头被角；走进农舍，揭开锅盖，看到的是清水煮南瓜，灶台上已多日不见油迹；他们更没有想到，这里的孩子几乎四分之一无钱上学，青壮年中三分之一是文盲，八九岁的孩子便佝偻着身子上山打柴。崔进明站在永新县城的湘赣革命纪念馆里，对着那八千多牺牲的烈士名册，他流泪了：在洒满烈士鲜血的土地上，胜利的果实怎么这样苦涩难尝？五百里井冈，点燃了中国革命的星星之火，却没有把自己脚下的穷根刨尽烧光。
    当现代文明已经大踏步进入中国，这里仍是被遗忘的一个角落。安贫若素。“两个月过年，三个月种田，七个月赌钱”，传统的生活方式根深蒂固。封闭狭隘的心理，对科学和文化本能地产生排斥。当地有资源，工作团动员办一些加工厂。“行，拿钱来！”国家每年给永新县扶助拨款七百多万元，“输血”不算少，但自身肌体缺乏“造血”功能，办厂只会要钱不会用钱，效益自然低得可怜。推广杂交水稻，培训班办了好几期，可还是有相当一部分人就是不愿种：“这样的稻种能多打谷？冒见过！”工作团每一项经济开发新措施，都得费九牛二虎之力去启蒙。一个穷得一日吃不饱三餐饭的山沟，还自认为是人间神圣的“伊甸园”。７０％以上的乡村没有电。夜幕降临，山野沉寂。早早收工回家，喝一碗稀粥，洗脚上床。外面的世界什么样？不知道。偶尔去过一次县城，倒好像出国留了洋。多少人一辈子没见过城市，没见过电灯，甚至没听过机器的轰响。
    崔进明心中不由得想起当年的毛委员。罗霄山脉中段这一片森严壁垒的高山大峒，的确是武装割据的最理想的地方。可现在，是８０年代，在商品经济大海中闭关自守，将肯定被抛弃和淘汰。井冈山的落后，主要是观念的落后。劳动力如果死守一地，死守一业，谈何经济开发？
    把山寨的大门打开，让改革开放的春风吹进来！工作团进山不到半年，作出了一项大胆的决策：有计划地组织劳务输出，把这里大量的剩余劳动力组织起来，到沿海经济特区去做工。增加收入是一方面，更重要的是，通过劳务输出来冲击当地的传统旧观念，把老区和特区这个现代中国的两极连接起来。
    特区需要女工。大批合资企业和“三来一补”企业需要劳动力。
    招工广告张贴到每个乡村。平静的农家掀起了波澜。作为导演，工作团对这场戏的高潮和结尾，设想得完全乐观。可是，没想到，大幕才刚刚拉开，舞台上的灯光便突然黯然下来。
    “只听说贩货出去卖的，哪辈子见过把人也贩出去？”“光要妹子去，怕是送给那边的残疾人做老婆哩！”“到外头去做工，妹子还嫁人不？”
    流言不胫而走。山沟里素来信息闭塞，奇怪的是，对新事物毫无根据的怀疑和非议会通过各种渠道传播开来，其速度之快，覆盖面之广，现代化的传播手段往往也望尘莫及。
    满心期望通过劳务输出冲击传统观念的工作团，没想到反而受到了传统观念的巨大冲击。“人贩子”，工作团背地被人送了这么一顶“桂冠”。
    崔进明斩钉截铁：“不管它，有一个送一个，有十个送十个。出去了的妹子回来会说话的！”
    到深圳做工，按劳务合同，三个月学徒期满，一个月平均可以赚１２０到１５０元钱。犹豫，怀疑，踌躇不前，但是，赵公元帅的威望毕竟难以动摇。一批生怕错过发财良机的人，还是下决心送自己的妹子报了名。
    “出去总有碗饱饭吃罗！工作团是共产党派来的，还会把妹子都拐了去？”
    “去吧，兴许一年能赚个几百元钱回来哩！那年我要跟着红军走了也好了，要么死在外头当烈士，要么如今当了官，哪会一辈子掀泥巴？”
    １９８７年１０月８日，宁冈县第一批报名的４４５名妹子，集中在县城开拔。她们穿着一新，带着被卷和旅行袋，兴高采烈地聚集在龙市的会师广场。当年毛泽东和朱德会师的地方如今成了姑娘们的海洋。妹子们的心情是高兴的，好像头一回发现了自己在这个世界上还有这样特殊的地位和价值，对未来的新生活充满着憧憬和希望。做父母的却一个个泪水盈眶，千叮咛，万嘱咐，好像是生离死别。八千多人口的小县城，多年没有过这样热闹。一个乡编一个队，两个队合乘一辆大客车，由各乡乡长带队。县里的领导和城镇的居民都赶来送行。抽泣声和欢笑声交织在一起，汇成了嘈杂的声浪。
    车轮转动了。一群雏鹰乳燕，结队南飞去。同她们的前辈出征不一样，没有战火，没有硝烟，但是在她们的心头，这无异也是一次离乡背井的“万里长征”。
    从井冈山到深圳，地理上的位置不过五六百公里，可对妹子们来说，简直就是从一个世界陡然来到另一个世界。繁华的城市，鳞次栉比的高楼大厦，光怪陆离的霓虹灯光……一切都是这样陌生，这样新奇，使她们不禁感到晕眩。
    井冈山的妹子，只有一小部分进了深圳的工厂，大部分分散在市郊的樟木头、矿厦和宝安县的新安、龙冈。厂子一般规模不大，二三百人，四五百人，也有的不过百把人，多是搞电子元件装配、塑料玩具、针织、五金杂件之类。天天流水作业，手工操作，从坐下起，一双眼、两只手就没一刻闲着。中午吃饭半小时，吃完饭接着干。一天少则八小时，多则十小时、十二小时。高频率、满负荷、快节奏，妹子们像拧紧了的发条那样过日子，几天就受不住了：“妈呀，上山打柴也冒这样累，做事还有不让歇口气的？”“坐一天，腰都快断了，这钱赚不得！”
    生活中举手抬脚都感到不适应、不习惯。吃饭，没辣子，这可怎么吃呀！在山里早上起来就要吃饭的，不吃没力气去做事。可现在，哪个厂家早上也不管饭，要吃，自己上街喝早茶去！那茶水能灌饱肚子？一个面包一元，连吃三个，还觉着没饱。索性早上不吃了，省下钱，饿着肚子去上工。干一天活下来，人乏了，身上脏了，想洗澡却没热水，只有“冲凉”。那冰凉的水浇在肌肤上，冷的直颤，心都凉透了。
    刚来时，几乎没一个妹子觉得这儿比山里好。受约束、受管辖，一天到晚都在老板和工长的睽目之下，走到哪儿都有点提心吊胆。吐了口痰，罚款。妹子恼了：“又没吐你身上，这还要管？”上班迟到三分钟，对不起，打卡机关闭，一天别干了。有的妹子在家可是天天等太阳晒到屁股才起床的呀，头一回晚了一分钟就被关在门外，呜呜地蹲在地上哭了起来。
    晚上时光最难捱。双层的铁架床，睡上铺的怕摔下来，躺下铺的又老觉着上面的床会塌。外头灯红酒绿，夜市的叫卖声和舞厅、茶座的音乐不绝于耳，川流不息的汽车喇叭和机器声彻夜轰鸣，翻来覆去睡不着。家乡的夜晚是多么美妙啊，夜幕拉开，山睡了、林睡了、鸟睡了，只有山间泉水潺潺流淌，那声音也是悦耳和醉人的。妹子们的心，还留在大山那边。
    昨天在老区，今天到了特区；昨天还是农民，今天成了工人。这样大跨度的变化对妹子们来说，简直是脱胎换骨。生活上的巨大反差很容易诱发心理上的逆反。初来乍到的好奇心和新鲜感一旦消失，对新生活的不适应便变成了怨恨和抵触。一批妹子动摇了，打起了退堂鼓。一个人带头，十个人响应；十个人走了，更多的人跟着跑。来时义无反顾，走时破釜沉舟。像海边涨潮退潮那样快，呼啦而来，又呼啦而去。等不到熬出三个月满师，结伴跑回去的竟几占三分之一。
    可别小看了这三分之一。她们回到山里见到亲人时那一把鼻涕一掬泪，是最蛊惑人心的言传。虽然没有“当婊子”“嫁残疾老公”之类的印证，但是吃不饱饭、睡不好觉、整天像劳改犯关在铁门里干活的说法，一传十，十传百，很快被添油加醋、活灵活现般传扬开来。
    “见到前山那妹子不？瘦得只剩皮包骨啦！”“造孽哟！一天坐着不准动，连屙尿都不行！”
    工作团正着手组织第二批、第三批，报了名的，把表格又要了回去。有妹子去了没回的，写信去催，有的跑去把人带回，更多的则是三天两头上工作团团部来吵，开口便要人。
    宁冈县包了六辆大客车去深圳，带队干部刚把妹子分到工厂安顿下来，归来时又带回了满满一车人。还有上百个妹子挤在那辆车旁，吵吵嚷嚷、哭哭啼啼，争着要回山里去。那车好像是惊涛骇浪中唯一的救生艇，大海中伸出无数双手攀着它意欲死里逃生。带队干部喊：“别挤，别挤呀！来了没几天就要回去，有什么脸面见家里人！”
    “莫要你管，让我们回去就行！”
    “这钱不赚了，回家种地去！”
    山里人倔。咬定了的事，八匹马也拉不回。
    现在在深圳留下的几千妹子，当初哪一个没偷偷缩在被窝里流过泪呢？哪一个不是经过反反复复的激烈思想斗争才在特区站住了脚跟？冲破传统的旧观念，需要勇气。适应现代的新生活，也需要毅力。
    深圳特区这个开放的劳务市场，外地劳工来自“五湖四海”。浓厚的乡土观念，免不了结成“帮派”。而所有的“帮派”之中，井冈山的妹子以钢铁般的团结和“战斗力”而名闻遐迩。“我们是井冈山来的！”她们毫不掩饰对家乡的自豪感。八角楼的灯光、小井的烈士墓、三湾的红枫、黄洋界的炮火，是山里妹子对外乡人最津津乐道的话题。她们一个个都可以把当年毛委员和朱军长的故事娓娓叙来，好象自己曾身临其境。
    在龙冈工业区，外地劳工两万人，井冈妹占了二千多。她们以工厂为单位组织起来，成立了劳工小组，推选了正副组长。不论你是哪个乡、哪个村的，原来在山里互不相识，现在都成了知心的姐妹，组长召之即来，挥之即去。在龙冈镇的大街上，有个井冈山地区劳工管理站。虽然只有十几平方米的一间房，两个干部，妹子们都很自然地把它当成了“家”，有事没事都上这儿坐坐，嘻嘻哈哈说说家乡话也痛快。逢年过节，管理站还举办一些集体文娱活动，参观啦，开晚会啦，妹子们兴头都挺高。龙年中秋一次晚会竟轰动了龙冈镇，六七千人赶来参加，一睹山里妹子风采。这样的劳工组织其它地方来的都没有，井冈妹独树一帜，因而更引人注目。
    不知是不是遗传因子在起作用，山里妹子跟她们的前辈一样倔强、好胜。在深圳市华光电子有限公司做工，每天往收录机机芯中装螺丝，定额三百。十四个井冈妹全部天天超额，手巧的最多装到一千二。老板对她们另眼相待，其它地方来的姑娘不由得酸溜溜的。妹子说：“都说井冈山穷，我们就是不服这口气，叫他们看看井冈山来的人个个都是能干的！”
    樟木头镇邮电局的职工谈到井冈妹时说：“山里来的姑娘真会攒钱。抠下伙食，连零头也汇走。寄的哪是钞票，是把心掏出来往家寄啊！”他们说起井冈妹头一次来汇款时的情景：手心里紧攥着票子，数了一遍又一遍，生怕少寄了一张回去。没填过汇款单，不会写大写的金额数，一笔一划，好象不是在写，而是在刻。钞票和汇款单递进窗口了，久久盯着，不肯离去：“能收到么？”“要几天？”“叫人一定送到我家啊！”邮局的同志觉着好笑，但也不能不为妹子们一片纯真的心所感动。
    山里穷，一个劳动力干上一年，连谷子折抵一起算，也不过二、三百元，在这儿两个月便赚到手了。“大团结”的票子，大多数妹子从来也没摸过哟！头一次领到工资，钞票放在贴胸的口袋里，连心口都觉着热。为了多赚点钱，井冈妹从来不吝惜自己的力气。晚上或节假日加班，一个小时两、三元港币，当地劳工不大愿干，井冈妹却争着干。她们希望自己收入比人家多，收入越多越觉得光采。对金钱价值的理解，在商品经济的社会里，是无师自通的。
    永新和宁冈都有“出去一个妹，养活一家人”之说。据统计，井冈山地区一年劳务输出的总收入超过４６０万元，平均每人年收入２０００至２５００元。一个妹子如果一年寄回家１０００元，以一家５口计，人均就增收２００元，再穷的特困户温饱问题也不难解决。
    春节，汪香兰回到了阔别的家乡。汽车开到高溪乡再不能往前开了，她拎着只时髦的旅行袋，沿着熟悉的山间小道，三步并着两步赶。进村口了，过谷场了，看到自家那土屋了。母亲在撒谷喂鸡，远远斜睨了她一眼，没吱声。父亲坐在石墩上编竹筐，抬头愣眼望着她，也没认出来。
    香兰的眼眶湿了。女儿走了还不到两年，你们就不认识了吗？
    “哎呀，死妹子，我还以为是工作团的干部哩！瞧这一身打扮，洋里洋气的，哪像我香兰呀！”变了，确实变了。香兰长高了，长胖了，出落得更秀气了。去深圳时不是扎两条小辫么，怎么烫了个“鸡毛窝”？一身枣红的滑雪衫，后边还带着风雪帽，石磨蓝的牛仔裤绷得屁股圆鼓鼓的，丑死了。
    左邻右舍的乡亲闻声跑来，像端详一位外星人，惊讶、羡慕，各种各样的眼光在妹子身上扫来扫去，香兰羞得一时满脸通红。
    女大十八变。何止是香兰呢，瞧瞧现在在深圳的那些山里妹子，一个个穿着打扮简直像换了一个人。时髦而不奢侈，淡雅而不华贵，没有浓妆艳抹，却又风姿绰约。山里人的土气看不到了，活脱脱一群“蓝领丽人”。
    朱美玉回到龙源口住到第五天头上，说什么也不肯呆下去了。不是不恋家乡，也不是不亲爹娘。快节奏的生活、高效益的工作磨练了两年，回到山里反而对闲适散漫的农家日子过不惯了。“唉呀，晚上电灯都没有，这么早困觉干吗？”“闷死人啦，整天坐在屋里没事情做！”这个１８岁的妹子是虚报了两岁才去了深圳的，长大成人的关键年代在特区的工厂里度过，新的观念容易入耳入脑。现代意识伴随着现代工业生产，在山里妹子身上悄悄地潜移默化。
    宁冈县一位县长今年带了几位干部去深圳看望姑娘们。在联美鞋厂，没料到竟被几个妹子将了军。县长抽的是“前门”烟，妹子们笑了，掏出一包“健牌”甩过去：“哎呀，县长，你当大官还抽没咀的烟哪！”县长问她们一个月挣多少钱，一个叫肖页玉的妹子拍着手跳起来：“反正比你挣的多，当县长的还不如我们做工的妹子，哈——！”窘得县长脸都红了。山里的妹子过去碰到县长早就躲得远远的，哪会像现在这样狂！
    山里妹子人生观确立的阶段，正好是处在老区和特区、农民和工人这样过渡的交叉点上，一旦克服了初来乍到时那种不适应，战胜了心理上的逆反，便很快对新的生活表现出巨大的热情。
    起初几个月，妹子们哪儿也不去，下工后没事宁可关在宿舍里聊天话家常。永新一批妹子出来做工路过广州时，汽车就停在第一流的中国大酒店门口，带队的喊她们下车进去看看，好些妹子无动于衷：“有什么好看的？哪有我们山里风景好！”等车的当儿，竟坐在车内甩起扑克玩。可是，现代化的生活毕竟是诱人的。在特区呆了几个月，还不知深圳市是啥模样，井冈妹的心动了。也不知谁起了个头，后来逢上假日，妹子们一伙伙结伴往深圳去。嗬，这才看到了大世界！那林立的高楼，车水马龙的街道，山里哪能比？站在国贸大厦前，仰着头数它有多少层，脖子都仰酸了，阳光刺得眼花缭乱，还在为它到底是五十四层或五十三层而争论不休。在樟木头袜厂做工的两个井冈妹，国庆节那天不知哪来一股激情冲动，穿戴打扮一番，竟要了一辆“的士”去观光。在深圳兜一圈回来，花了二十五元。有人啧啧咋舌，她俩却高兴的要命：“二十五元也值得，这一趟到处都看到了！”
    在龙冈做工的一群妹子相约看大海去。每人交六元，包一辆大客车，跑几十公里专为看看海是什么样子！“到了，到了，我看见海了！”一个妹子先喊起来。没等车停稳，一窝蜂涌下车，如醉如狂般直往海边跑。在沙滩上照相，在海边拾螺捡贝，边舞边唱。有的干脆赤脚下到水里，正面迎击那潮汐般涌来的阵阵海浪。从山的自然到海的自然，从闭塞的山沟到广袤的海洋，妹子们的心灵，像丽日下的海水一样荡漾着金光。
    妹子们把海滨拍摄的彩照寄回家。听说有个妹子的照片被她爸爸当场就撕了。她穿着一身鲜红的泳衣站在海滩上。父亲骂：“野了心了。疯疯癫癫的，像什么样！”
    几个妹子南下，给井冈山老区所带来的震荡是难以估量的。不仅仅是农民家庭增加了收入，也不仅仅是妹子们见了世面，经受了锻炼，更重要、更深远的是，劳务输出把整个老区的经济和生活都搅动了起来。
    一个封闭的环被突破，链条开始重新组合。
    永新和宁冈，过去乡镇企业一穷二白，有的乡镇甚至没一家企业。这两年，每个乡都办起了一批新厂，越是特困乡，办工业的积极性越高。据民政部工作团统计，井冈山地区乡办、村办新引进的企业就有２３个。资金和技术的输入是劳务输出的孪生物。几个妹子在特区，做工的同时也充当了经济发展的媒介。一些精明的港商老板跑到井冈山来了。这里大片廉价的地皮和大量廉价的劳动力，显然具有极大的诱惑。
    出去做工的井冈妹眼界宽了，也有打算回来后跟人合伙开店办厂的。宁冈有个妹子，现在还在深圳一家五金电器厂做工，但是已经有了“野心”：“回到山里我也要办个五金电器厂，这事也不是那么难，关键是先要把技术和管理学到手。”资金呢？她笑着回答：“跟人合伙呗！我还得在这干几年，等挣够了一笔钱，就跟这儿拜拜了！”
    经商做生意比办厂容易，有点小本钱就行。妹子们成批从井冈山到深圳，从深圳到井冈山，来来往往，起初都空着手跑，后来大多捎点儿“货”。深圳那边的衣料啦、皮鞋啦、塑料玩艺啦……在井冈山这一带市场上到处可以见到。去年过年，深圳捎来信息，瓜子卖到三元五角，当时井冈山最高也只卖到一元五角，往深圳去的妹子一个个捎带上瓜子跑，生意虽小，来回路费全挣回来了。有妹子在深圳“驻点”，井冈山和深圳的联系一下子紧密起来，每天开往茶陵、郴州接转火车的“大巴”“中巴”都是满载，单纯为观光跑去的不多，大多是贩点东西做买卖。劳务输出把商品流通也带动了起来，这个连锁反应连民政部工作团也始料不及。
    井冈山，在妹子们的带动下，终于向四面八方敞开了山寨的大门。
