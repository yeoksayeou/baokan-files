Recently, relevant departments of the Dalian Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government took the initiative to raise over 40,000 yuan to support the China Children's Art Theatre in performing for young audiences in Dalian.

"The Residents of Douzhu Town and the Bandits" is a well-received play staged by the China Children's Art Theatre for children. The theatre planned to tour northern cities but encountered financial difficulties. Upon learning of this, the Dalian Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government organized and raised funds, with the Jīnzhōu Textile Factory and other units actively supporting the effort. Fang Jūfēn, the director of the China Children's Art Theatre, emotionally stated, "The Dalian Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government are so supportive of us. We will definitely do our best to put on a good show for the children."

The performance team recently arrived in Dalian, where they have performed dozens of shows.

　　大连集资支持儿艺为孩子演出
    本报讯　最近，大连市委、市政府有关部门出面集资４万余元，支持中国儿童艺术剧院赴大连为少年儿童演出。
    《豆蔻镇的居民与强盗》是儿艺为孩子们排的一出好剧，儿艺准备北上为孩子们巡回演出，但遇到资金短缺的困难。大连市委、市政府得知这一情况后，出面组织、筹措资金，金洲纺织厂等单位积极支持。中国儿艺院长方掬芬感动地说：“大连市委、市府这么支持我们，我们一定尽最大努力给孩子们演好戏。”
    该剧剧组不久前开赴大连，在那里演出了好几十场。
