	Nepal-India Transit Trade Dispute Threatens Himalayan Forests
	U.S. Congressmen Urge India to Reopen Nepal-India Border Crossings

	Islamabad, April 22 (by Ren Yujun) According to today's report by the Pakistani newspaper *Muslim*, due to India's suspension of oil and coal supplies to Nepal, residents in the Himalayan foothills are severely short of fuel and have resorted to cutting down trees for cooking.

	The report states that Nepalese residents have long relied on wood for fuel, leading to severe damage to the original forests of the Himalayas. In recent years, there have been frequent landslides and mudslides. The United Nations has sent ecological protection personnel and relevant experts to both restore the environment and guide Nepalese residents to use coal and oil products as fuel. This work has been effective over the past two years.

	Since the beginning of last month, due to disputes between India and Nepal over trade and transit issues, Nepal has been unable to obtain coal and oil products from India or third countries. By mid-month, the fuel reserves in the mountain areas had been depleted, and residents have once again started cutting down trees. Local United Nations officials have appealed that the tourist season in Nepal has begun, and a large number of tourists will soon arrive, increasing the demand for fuel. If the trade transit dispute is not resolved in time, the Himalayan forests will face another disaster.

	Washington, April 22 (Xinhua) Fifty U.S. congressmen wrote a letter this week to the Indian Ambassador to the United States, urging the Indian government to reopen most of the border crossings to Nepal that India recently closed.

	The congressmen said that India's decision is legally unfounded and "threatens the stability of the Indian subcontinent." India recently closed 13 out of 15 border crossings, citing the expiration of its trade and transit agreement with Nepal.

	The 17 million people of Nepal are a landlocked country, importing most of their goods from India. These U.S. congressmen said that India's actions against Nepal have directly affected the lives of the Nepalese people.

　　尼印过境贸易纠葛  危及喜马拉雅森林    
    美议员要求印度开放尼印边境站
    本报伊斯兰堡４月２２日电  记者任毓骏报道：据巴基斯坦《穆斯林报》今天消息，由于印度停止向尼泊尔提供石油产品和煤，喜马拉雅山麓的居民严重缺乏燃料，不得不又砍伐林木为炊。
    据报道，由于尼泊尔居民多年来以木材为燃料，喜马拉雅原始森林遭破坏，近年来多次发生山崩、滑坡等事故。联合国为此专门派出生态保护人员和有关专家一方面治理环境，一方面引导尼泊尔居民使用煤和石油产品作燃料。这项工作开展两年来已颇有成效。
    自上月初印度和尼泊尔在贸易与过境问题上发生分歧以来，尼泊尔得不到从印度或第三国提供的煤和石油产品。到本月中旬，在山区建立的燃料库库存告罄，居民们已重新上山砍伐林木。驻在当地的联合国官员为此呼吁，尼旅游季节已开始，大量游客将相继到来，燃料需求量将更大，如不及时解决贸易过境纠纷，喜马拉雅森林将再遭劫难。
    新华社华盛顿４月２２日电　５０名美国议员本周写信给印度驻美大使，要求印度政府重新开放最近被印度关闭的通往尼泊尔的大部分边境站。
    这些议员说，印度的这一决定在法律上是没有根据的，它“威胁到印度次大陆的稳定”。印度最近借口它同尼泊尔的贸易和过境协定到期而关闭了１５个边境站中的１３个。
    拥有１７００万人口的尼泊尔是个内陆国家，大部分货物从印度进口。这些美国议员说，印度这一反对尼泊尔的行动已经直接影响到尼泊尔人民的生活。
