Spring planting season, the agricultural development issues discussion meeting of Hebei Langfang City is very "hot". Farmers who have been dealing with the land for years and city, county, township, and village cadres sit together, talking at length, discussing the development of agriculture.

The situation is urgent: agriculture has indeed stagnated

Zhào Huìshēn (Langfang City Party Secretary): Like the rest of the country, our city's agriculture has experienced a period of rapid development, but in recent years, it has also fallen into a state of stagnation. What should we do? Let's prescribe some remedies together.

Langfang City's annual agricultural output value increased from 510 million yuan in 1980 to 10.2 billion yuan in 1984, doubling in four years, but in the past four years, it has decreased by 2%; grain yield per mu increased by 71 kilograms from 1980 to 1984, but in the following four years, it decreased by 4.5 kilograms; the agricultural commodity rate increased from 40% to 53% from 1980 to 1984, but after 1985, it has basically not increased.

First Prescription: Seek Efficiency from the Market

Kǒng Fánxǐ (National People's Congress Representative, Ba County Xinjiazhuang Village Party Branch Secretary): I went to Tianjin and found that the production of agricultural and sideline products in the suburbs of Tianjin is far from meeting the consumption needs of the city. The supply gap for pork, beef, mutton, aquatic products, and fruits is between 15% and 50%. We are neighbors with Beijing and Tianjin, which is our advantage and also an opportunity for development.

(Langfang City is located between Beijing and Tianjin, with a superior geographical location. The conditions for developing urban-suburban agriculture are excellent. Taking Sanhe County as an example, in the second half of 1987, the county ensured grain production while encouraging farmers to "three plant": vegetables, fruits, and cotton; "five raise": pigs, cattle, sheep, poultry, and fish, and the products were sent to the two cities. As a result, the county's agricultural output value increased by 26.4% in 1988, reaching the growth rate of the initial stage of the Great Leap Forward.)

Xuē Bóchāng (Gu'an County Party Secretary): Developing urban-suburban agriculture mainly focuses on services, especially post-production services. In the past, farmers grew some vegetables and had to drive their small tractors to Beijing. Now it's more convenient. We have cooperated with Xicheng District in Beijing to set up a wholesale market. Last year, 13,000 tons of cabbage were sold on-site, which was convenient for farmers and pleased the citizens.

Lǐ Guìshān (Sanhe County Supply and Marketing Cooperative Director): During our efforts to develop the county's poultry industry, we encountered the problem of rising feed prices. Our solution is to set a protection price. If the feed price rises, the price for purchasing meat chickens will also rise, ensuring that farmers earn about two yuan from each chicken, while our cooperative only earns the price of two chicken feet. We have to reduce our profits to protect the farmers' interests. Otherwise, farmers won't raise chickens, and who will we slaughter on our new slaughter line? (Laughter)

Second Prescription: Improve Land Output

Yú Jǐnghuì (Dàchǎng County Committee Office Staff): Land scale management is a means to solve agricultural stagnation, but it cannot be forcibly promoted. Farmers will only voluntarily give up their contracted land if they have reliable non-agricultural income.

Zhāng Wénshèng (Dàchǎng County Committee Office Deputy Director): To implement scale management, there must be a premise that labor can be transferred. Currently, the estimation of labor transfer is too high. Going out for a few days a year and selling radishes or sugar-coated haws for a couple of days is also considered labor transfer?

(The remarks of the two comrades from Dàchǎng County are not groundless. Last year, their county's Héxīyíng Village implemented "scale management." Apart from allocating 5 mu of inferior land and distant land to each farmer for food, the rest was concentrated into a farm. Due to the lack of objective conditions, most farmers strongly opposed it. As a result, more than 400 mu of food land did not plant a single mu of winter wheat, and farmers even chartered a bus to Beijing to petition. A few months later, they had to redistribute the land.)

Zhāng Guóbīn (Wén'ān County Party Secretary): When implementing scale management, the foundation of household management must not be shaken, and the will of the masses must be respected. It must also be adapted to local conditions, with diverse forms, and not a one-size-fits-all approach. Otherwise, it will only exacerbate instability and stagnation.

Third Prescription: Use "High" to Supplement "Low"

Jú Liányǒng (Sanhe City Small Cáo Village Farmer): Nowadays, selling ice cream is more profitable than farming, but the land still has to be farmed. I contracted 53 mu of land, but I can't afford to apply chemical fertilizer. I thought, I should raise more pigs. I raised 53 pigs, and all the pig manure was used on the land, 4 carts per mu, making the land as soft as flour. Last year, I produced 57,000 jin of grain, and with pig raising, I earned 160,000 yuan, which is even better than having a crawler tractor for transportation, and the income is stable.

Yáng Yǒngquán (Xiānghé County Xiāngchéngtún Township Head): In recent years, our township has used the income of 300 million yuan from animal husbandry to drill wells, lay power lines, purchase agricultural machinery, and build anti-seepage pipelines, and agriculture has also improved.

Lǐ Jùnlín (Xiānghé County Lǐzhuāng Village Party Branch Secretary): For agriculture to advance, industry must support it. Our village's land is barren, and the wheat yield is low, leaving farmers with little money. In recent years, we have established 6 factories, investing 400,000 yuan in profits from industry into agriculture. Now, the entire village's 1,000 mu of grain fields have irrigation pipelines, with every plot having a well, and every well is equipped, increasing the grain yield from a few jin to nearly 1,000 jin.

(Industrial profits are higher than agricultural profits; within agriculture, animal husbandry and forestry profits are higher than planting; within planting, economic crops often have higher profits than grain crops. If farmers only focus on high-profit areas, who will grow grain? How to solve this? Use high profits to supplement low profits, this prescription is practical and feasible.)

Fourth Prescription: Seek Potential from Science and Technology

Wáng Kuān (Bá County Xiǎoxīnzhuāng Village Farmer): I became a "millionaire" in agriculture, relying on science! Now, 90% of people don't know how to plow. Plowing requires attention to temperature and humidity, it's not just about plowing randomly. Everyone talks about investment, but investment without science is blind investment, the more you invest, the more you waste.

Dǒng Kèyì (Dàchéng County Deputy County Magistrate): Agriculture has the "Eight-Character Constitution," and now focusing on any of these aspects has potential. Our county has low-lying saline-alkali land and insufficient water resources. Since 1983, we have adopted the method of science and technology teams taking on contracts to promote a set of "rapid high-yield technology for grain on barren land," increasing the grain yield per mu by 36 jin.

Xuē Bóchāng: When promoting scientific and technological achievements, we also adopt the method of team contracting, combining the strengths of technical departments, material departments, and government departments, and the effect is good.

(The potential of scientific and technological achievements is enormous, and promoting scientific and technological achievements cannot rely solely on technical departments. The "team contracting" method of Dàchéng and Gu'ān Counties is worth learning from.)

Fifth Prescription: Awaken the Dormant Resources

Lǐ Shàngzhì (Yǒngqīng County Agricultural Economics Department Director): To break the stagnation in agriculture, from our perspective in Yǒngqīng, we can take development-oriented production as a breakthrough.

(Yǒngdīng River's old course runs through the entire Yǒngqīng County. In the past, there were 200,000 mu of wasteland in the old course area that was not utilized. In 1982, Yǒngqīng County began the largest-scale development of the old course since the founding of the country. In a few years, 90,000 mu of wasteland was developed.)

Wáng Guóqiáng (Langfang City Party Secretary): I used to be the county party secretary of Yǒngqīng. In the early days of the founding of the country, this county had an average of 3 mu of arable land per person, now only 1.8 mu. Development is a solution.

Zhōu Shìyì (Langfang City Vice Mayor): Development-oriented production includes the transformation of medium and low-yield fields. Our entire city has 58 million mu of arable land, with 46 million mu being medium and low-yield fields. If these fields are transformed into high-yield fields, the total grain production can be increased by at least 5 billion jin.

Getting out of "stagnation" requires a good environment

Although the attendees are enthusiastic about prescribing remedies, they are still at a loss when faced with some issues.

Dǒng Kèyì: I have been in charge of agriculture for eight or nine years. To say that the leadership does not pay attention is not true. Developing agriculture, except for not giving money, everything is given. (Everyone laughs) In the past, it was said "the whole party promotes agriculture," now it is "the whole party talks about agriculture."

Xuē Bóchāng: In recent years, cotton production has declined due to policies. In 1984, the higher-ups passed on information: there is too much cotton, it won't be needed for six years, and we were told to lead farmers out of cotton fields. Farmers had to switch to growing vegetables. Now that vegetables are up, the higher-ups have given a mandatory task to increase cotton planting. The masses say: "Covering the mouth, anyway, it's inside." "Cotton planting is not profitable, we can only evenly distribute it. I'm sorry, everyone made money from cotton in the past few years, now let's share the difficulty for the country."

Jú Liányǒng: This year, the power supply keeps "clicking" and stopping, the wheat cannot be watered during the green-up period, and I am most worried about this.

Dǒng Kèyì: Now, with 200 million people in the city, if anything happens, it's not good. If vegetables are expensive, it's not good, if wages are low, it's not good, but how come when crops are eaten by pests and there is no medicine to treat them, no one cares?

Zhōu Shìyì: The big environment problem, we local governments are powerless. What should we do? Still, solve problems while developing. Solve them better, develop faster; if not solved, find ways to move forward. If the big environment can't be changed, then find ways to create a "microclimate."

专栏：怎样突破徘徊？——农业发展问题

　　咱们一道开“药方”    
    ——廊坊市干部、农民农业发展问题座谈会实录
    春耕时节，河北廊坊市的农业发展问题座谈会开得挺“热”。常年与土地打交道的农民和市、县、乡村干部坐在一起，说长道短，商量发展农业的事。
    形势紧迫：农业确实出现了徘徊
    赵惠臣（廊坊市委书记）：与全国一样，我市农业经过一段长足发展后，近几年也陷入了徘徊境地。怎么办？咱们也一起开开“药方”。
    廊坊市每年的农业总产值，在１９８０年到１９８４年间从５．１亿元上升到１０．２亿元，翻了一番，而在近４年却又下降了２％；粮食亩产１９８０年到１９８４年增加了７１公斤，而在以后的４年中却下降了４．５公斤；农业商品率，在１９８０年到１９８４年间从４０％上升到５３％，而１９８５年后却基本没有增长。
    第一张“药方”：向市场要效益
    孔繁喜（全国七届人大代表、霸县新家堡村党总支书记）：我去天津调查发现，天津近郊区农副产品生产远远满足不了市民的消费需求。猪牛羊肉、水产品和水果供需缺口占１５％到５０％。我们与京津是近邻，这是我们的优势，也是发展的机会。
    （廊坊市地处北京和天津之间，地理位置优越。发展以市场为导向的城郊型农业条件得天独厚。以三河县为例，１９８７年下半年，这个县在保证粮食生产的前提下，鼓励农民“三种”：种菜、种果、种棉；“五养”：养猪、养牛、养羊、养禽、养鱼，产品向两大市输送。结果，全县１９８８年农业产值增长了２６．４％，再度达到了大包干初期的增长速度。）
    薛伯昌（固安县委书记）：发展城郊型农业，主要抓服务，特别是产后服务。过去，农民种了点菜，还得自己开着小拖拉机“突突突”地上北京。现在省了心。我们与北京西城区联营，搞了一个批发市场，去年１３００万公斤大白菜，农民就地出售，方便了农民，乐了市民。
    李贵山（三河县供销社主任）：我们供销社在抓全县养鸡业的过程中碰上饲料涨价的问题。我们的办法是确定一个保护价。饲料涨，肉鸡收购价也随着往上调，保证农民从每只鸡上得到两块钱左右的收入，而我们供销社只拿两只鸡爪子钱。减我们的利，保农民的利。不这样不行，农民不养鸡，我们新上的屠宰线宰谁去？（哄堂大笑）
    第二张“药方”：提高土地产出率
    于景会（大厂县委办公室干部）：土地规模经营是解决农业徘徊的一种手段，但不能强行推进。农民自愿让出承包田只有非农业收入可靠才能办到。
    张文胜（大厂县委办公室副主任）：搞规模经营要有个前提，劳动力要有转移的地方。现在对劳力转移估计过高，一年出去三五十天，卖两天萝卜、糖葫芦也算转移？
    （大厂县两位同志的发言并非无的放矢。他们县的河西营村去年搞“规模经营”，除分给每个农民５分次地、远地当口粮田外，其余全部集中办农场。由于客观条件不具备，多数农民坚决反对。结果４００多亩口粮田一亩冬小麦也没种，农民还自己租汽车进京请愿。几个月后，不得不重新“分田”。）
    张国斌（文安县委书记）：搞规模经营，一定不要动摇家庭经营这个基础，一定要尊重群众意愿，还要因地制宜，形式多样，不搞一刀切。不然，只会加剧动荡和徘徊。
    第三张“药方”：以“高”补“低”
    朱连勇（三河县城关镇小曹庄农民）：如今，卖冰棍都比种地强，可地又不能不种。我包了５３亩地，光施化肥施不起，我琢磨着，多养点猪吧。我养了５３头猪，猪粪全部往地里使，１亩地４车，地像麸子一样软。去年产了５．７万斤粮食，加上养猪，收入１．６万元，比有一个链轨车（拖拉机）跑运输的还强，而且种出来的东西有人要，收入稳当。
    杨永权（香河县香城屯乡乡长）：这几年，我们乡用养殖业得到的３００多万元收入打井、通电、购置农机，修防渗管道，农业也上去了。
    李俊林（香河县李庄村党支部书记）：农业上台阶，工业要保驾。我们村土地瘠薄，小麦产量低，农民手头没钱。这几年，我们办了６个厂，把工业上的４０多万利润投到农业上。现在，全村千亩粮田浇地管道化，块块有机井，井井都配套，粮食产量由过去的几十斤增加到近千斤。
    （乡镇企业的收益高于农业；在农业内部，养殖业、林果业的收益又高于种植业；种植业内部，经济作物的收益又常高于粮食作物。如果农民都只往收益高的地方使劲，那粮食就没人种了。怎么办？以高补低，即用收益高的补收益低的，这张“药方”倒是现实可行的。）
    第四张“药方”：向科技要潜力
    王宽（霸县小辛庄村农民）：我搞农业成了“万元户”，靠什么，就靠科学！现在种地的９０％不会耪地。耪地得讲究气温、湿度，不是随便耪一遍就了事的。大家都说投入，不讲科学的投入是瞎投入，投入越多，越浪费。
    董克义（大城县副县长）：农业有“八字宪法”，现在抓哪一项都有潜力。我们县土地低洼盐碱，水源不足。１９８３年以来，采取科技集团承包的办法，推行了一整套的“瘠薄地粮食快速高产技术”，全县粮食单产增加了３６公斤。
    薛伯昌：我们在推广科技成果时，也采取集团承包的办法，把技术部门和物资部门、技术部门和政府部门的力量联合起来，效果不错。
    （科技成果的潜力很大，而推广科技成果不能只靠科技部门一家。大城和固安两县的“集团承包”办法值得借鉴。）
    第五张“药方”：唤醒沉睡的资源
    李尚质（永清县农经部长）：要打破农业徘徊局面，就我们永清的情况看，可以把开发性生产作为突破口。
    （永定河故道贯穿永清县全境。过去，故道区有２０万亩荒地没有得到利用。１９８２年，永清县开始了建国以后最大规模的故道开发活动。几年之间，开发了９万多亩荒地。）
    王国强（廊坊市委秘书长）：我在永清当过县委书记。建国初期，这个县人均耕地有３亩，现在才１．８亩。开发是个办法。
    周士毅（廊坊市副市长）：开发性生产包括对中低产田的改造。我们全市有５８０万亩耕田，中低产田就占了４６０万亩。如果把这些田变成高产田，粮食总产至少可增加５亿公斤。
    摆脱“徘徊”必须有一个好环境
    别看与会者这样踊跃开“药方”，在有些问题面前，他们依然束手无策。
    董克义：我抓了八九年农业。要说领导不重视，也不是。发展农业，除了要钱不给，什么都给。（众人笑）过去说“全党大办农业”，现在是“全党大讲农业”。
    薛伯昌：这几年棉花生产下降是由政策造成的。１９８４年，上头传来信息：棉花多得不得了，６年不用进口，要我们把农民领出棉花田。农民只好改种蔬菜。现在菜上去了，上面又下死任务，叫增种棉花。群众说：“盖连嘴呀，反正都是理（里）。”“种棉又不上算，我们只好户户均摊。对不起，前几年大伙发棉花财，现在分着为国家担点困难吧。”
    朱连勇：今年电老是“呱哒呱哒”地停，小麦返青水浇不上，我最担心的是这个。
    董克义：现在，城市两亿人，出点什么事都不行，菜贵了不行，工资低了不行，怎么庄稼被虫子吃了没药治就没人管？
    周士毅：大环境问题，我们地方无能为力。怎么办呢？还是边解决问题，边发展吧。解决得好一点，发展得快一点；不解决，也得想法子往前走。大环境没办法，就想办法抓“小气候”。
