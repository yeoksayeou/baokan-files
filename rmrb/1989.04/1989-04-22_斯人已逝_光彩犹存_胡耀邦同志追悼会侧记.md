The Light Remains Even Though the Man Has Passed
— A Side Record of Comrade Hu Yaobang’s Funeral

On the morning of April 22, the Central Hall of the Great Hall of the People was solemn and solemn.

A red party flag covered him. At this moment, he was dressed in a black suit, lying peacefully. He was always full of vitality and enthusiasm in people's memory. But now he was lying quietly. He was too tired. He had worked too hard and carried too much!

In the center of the venue, a large color photograph of Comrade Yaobang was hung high, framed in black. This photo was taken on April 6 and was his last photo. In this photo, personally selected by his wife Li Zhao, he looked older and thinner than before. Only those eyes remained deep and wise, shining with the light of wisdom...

At 9:54 AM, Li Zhao, accompanied by Wang Guangmei and relatives, led her children to slowly enter the hall and stand under Yaobang's portrait.

At 9:58 AM, Deng Xiaoping, Zhao Ziyang, and other party and state leaders slowly entered the venue.

At 10:00 AM, Comrade Yang Shangkun presided over the funeral, announced a moment of silence, and played the national anthem. When Comrade Zhao Ziyang delivered the eulogy, a young rural woman with a child in Comrade Yaobang's family wept softly. She was Comrade Yaobang's niece, who accompanied Yaobang's brother Yaofu from their hometown in Wenjiamarket, Liuyang, Hunan, to attend the funeral on April 19.

In the hall, more than 4,000 representatives from various fronts stood solemnly to pay their respects to Comrade Yaobang. Since last night, students from universities in the capital and other citizens gathered on Tiananmen Square to listen to the live broadcast of the event through loudspeakers, expressing their deep sorrow to the mentor of the youth, the leader of the people, and the confidant of intellectuals, Yaobang. Inside and outside the Great Wall, along the Yangtze River, tens of millions of people watched the live broadcast on radios and televisions, weeping together.

Comrade Yaobang, have you really left? The black banners, countless wreaths, white flowers on people's chests, and countless tearful eyes in the Central Hall all testify to this nightmare-like reality.

“Yaobang, you can't leave, you still have so much to do!” Comrade Li Zhao led her children to say their final goodbye to Comrade Yaobang, and the sound of grief was heart-wrenching.

“Why did you leave? On March 18, when I visited your home, the pineapple you gave me was still fresh, but you are no longer here, you can't leave!” Liu Ying, who came from Jiamusi, was an active member of the "Youth Reclamation Team" in the 1950s who had been commended by Comrade Yaobang. She hugged Comrade Yaobang's sons Hu De Ping and Hu De Hua, and was overwhelmed with grief.

95-year-old old man Bao Erhan sat in a wheelchair and came to the coffin. He insisted on being helped to walk down to bow to Comrade Yaobang and slowly walked past the coffin.

An old general with white hair wept loudly in front of the coffin.

Comrade Zhuo Lin led her children, with tears in her eyes, to bow deeply to Comrade Yaobang, and then hugged Comrade Li Zhao for a long time, asking her to take care of herself. Li Zhao said softly: Please ask Comrade Xiaoping to take good care of his health.

Sten Baoxiang, the editor-in-chief of the Theoretical Trends editorial department of the Central Party School, emotionally recalled the days and nights with Comrade Yaobang when he founded Theoretical Trends. He said, Comrade Yaobang's goal for this magazine was very clear from the beginning: to reverse the right and wrong of thought, theory, and politics that had been reversed by the Lin Biao and the Gang of Four. “Comrade Yaobang had profound thoughts. He was an outstanding Marxist thinker and theorist.”

Zhao Rong, the adjutant of Zhu De, the logistics department head of the Fourth Column when Comrade Yaobang was the political commissar, and the old Red Army soldier, is already 90 years old. He said to the reporter in a wheelchair: Comrade Yaobang was sincere to people and himself, and never used his position to engage in improper practices. His children all grew up through their own struggles. Hu Keshu, who had worked with Comrade Yaobang for 24 years, said to the reporter with tears in his eyes, Comrade Yaobang was clean in his governance, upright and honest, and sincere to people. It was this point that won the universal respect and love of the Party and the people.

The mourning ceremony ended, and many people still found Comrade Yaobang's relatives to cry together.

Comrade Yaobang, you have left,
In the deep emotions of your people,
You left an irreparable
Gap.

　　斯人已逝  光彩犹存   
    ——胡耀邦同志追悼会侧记
    本报记者  高新庆  朱维群
    ４月２２日上午。人民大会堂中央大厅庄严肃穆。
    鲜红的党旗覆盖在他身上。此时，他身着黑色西装，神态安详地躺着。他身旁环绕着洁白的马蹄莲和青青的松柏。脚下是一丛火一般的杜鹃花。
    他在人们的记忆中总是那样充满活力，热情洋溢。而此刻却静静地躺着。他太累了。他操劳过度，背负的东西过多！
    会场正中高悬着镶在黑框内的耀邦同志大幅彩色照片。这张照片是４月６日拍摄的，也是他最后的一张照片。在这幅由他的夫人李昭亲自选定的照片上，他比以前苍老了、消瘦了。唯有那双眼睛，仍然是那样深沉，闪烁着智慧之光……
    ９点５４分，李昭同志在王光美同志和亲属的搀扶下，率子女缓缓步入大厅，站列在耀邦的遗像下。
    ９点５８分，邓小平、赵紫阳等党和国家领导人缓步进入会场。
    １０时，杨尚昆同志主持追悼会，宣布默哀，奏国歌。当紫阳同志致悼词时，耀邦同志的家属中，一位带孩子的农村青年妇女低声抽泣。她是耀邦同志的侄媳，１９日陪耀邦同志的哥哥耀福从湖南浏阳文家市老家赶来参加追悼会。
    大厅内，４０００多名来自各条战线的代表肃立着，向耀邦同志致哀。天安门广场上，从昨晚起就聚集在广场上的首都高校学生和其他群众，收听高音喇叭中转播的现场实况，向青年的导师、群众领袖、知识分子的知音耀邦表示深切的哀悼。长城内外，大江南北，亿万人民在收音机、电视机前收看现场直播，同声悲泣。
    耀邦同志，您真的去了？中央大厅里条条黑色挽幛，数不清的花圈，人们胸前朵朵白花，无数的泪眼，证实着这恶梦般的现实。
    “耀邦，你不能走，你还能做好多事呀！”李昭同志率子女向耀邦同志作最后的告别，悲痛之声催人泪下。
    “您咋就走了啊？３月１８日在您家作客时，您送给我的菠萝还新鲜着呢，可您就不在了，您不能走啊！”从佳木斯专程赶来的刘瑛，是５０年代受过耀邦同志表彰的“青年垦荒队”积极分子，她抱着耀邦同志的儿子胡德平、胡德华，悲痛欲绝。
    ９５岁的包尔汉老人，坐轮椅来到灵前，他执意要人搀他走下来向耀邦同志鞠躬，并缓缓步过灵柩。
    一位白发苍苍的老将军在灵前放声大哭。
    卓琳同志率子女，满含热泪，向耀邦同志深深鞠躬，然后同李昭同志长久地拥抱，请她节哀保重。李昭轻声说：务必请小平同志多多保重身体。
    中央党校《理论动态》编辑部主任沈宝祥深情地回顾了耀邦同志创办《理论动态》时和大家在一起的日日夜夜。他说，耀邦同志办这个刊物，起始目标就很明确：把被林彪、“四人帮”一伙颠倒的思想、理论、政治上的是非再颠倒过来。“耀邦同志思想深刻，他是一位杰出的马克思主义思想家、理论家。”
    朱老总的副官、耀邦同志任四纵队政委时的该部后勤部长、老红军赵熔，已９０高龄了。他坐在轮椅上对记者说：耀邦同志对人对己表里如一，从不利用职务搞不正之风。他的子女都是靠自己奋斗成长的。与耀邦同志共事２４年的胡克实，饱含热泪对记者说，耀邦同志为政清廉，光明磊落，坦诚待人，正是这一点，赢得党和人民的普遍尊敬和热爱。
    悼念仪式结束，还有很多人找到耀邦同志的亲属抱头痛哭。
    耀邦同志，您走了，
    在您的人民的感情深处，
    留下了永难弥补的
    断层。
    ……
