Early spring in Beijing is still chilly, yet among the representatives attending the third session of the Chinese Enterprise Management Association Women's Federation in Beijing, there is one who brought along a lively and adorable little girl. She is Wang Shoulan, the manager of the Changchun Yimin Food Store.

Wang Shoulan, with her broad mind and plump figure, has short, slightly permed hair and wears a pair of black-rimmed glasses. Her blue, black, and red sportswear adds a youthful vibrancy to her 50-year-old self. If her plump figure might hint at her prosperity, her ordinary appearance would hardly reveal the hardships and tribulations she has endured in life, nor the vast love she has given to society.

Wang Shoulan is an orphan who has never been married, but she is the head of a large family. This family consists of 28 people, 23 of whom have different surnames. Apart from Wang Shoulan, the others were either widowed, orphaned, disabled youths, abandoned infants, or street beggars.

It all seems so distant now. In 1946, the rampant plague took the lives of Wang Shoulan's parents, and at the age of five, she was sold to be a child bride. After liberation, the Party and the government sent her to an orphanage to study. In 1963, Wang Shoulan graduated from the Physical Education Department of Jilin Normal University and went to work at the Jilin Provincial Department of Education. During the Cultural Revolution, she was wrongfully accused and sentenced to 20 years in prison. In 1980, the Party and the government rectified her case, and Wang Shoulan was exonerated and released from prison.

From her ordeals, she came to understand the true meaning of love and life. She loves society and the people around her, and helping the country and others is her greatest joy.

In 1982, Wang Shoulan learned that her uncle in the countryside was living alone and struggling. She went to bring the old man back to her home, which is located opposite the Changchun Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital.

The following year, on a summer morning, the noise outside the window was mixed with the cries of a baby. Wang Shoulan went out and saw a sanitation worker holding a baby girl she had found in the trash, with two large lumps on her body. "How pitiful," she said, "I will raise her!" From then on, her monthly salary of 62 yuan had to support herself and an old man and a baby, plus medical expenses for the baby. Life was extremely difficult. Wang Shoulan named the baby "Wang Qiong," meaning "poverty" at that time.

The patients at the obstetrics and gynecology hospital across the street had trouble buying red sugar and toilet paper, causing many inconveniences. To help the sisters and for the livelihood of her three-person family, at the end of 1983, Wang Shoulan borrowed 500 yuan to hang a sign reading "Yimin Daily Necessities Store" in her window, selling red sugar, eggs, toilet paper, and other items. The small store opened at 4 AM every morning and closed at 11 or 12 PM at night. She sold eggs, each one 5 fen cheaper than others; she boiled rice porridge for free for pregnant women and patients. Over the years, the small store's reputation grew, business flourished, and the small business grew like a snowball, becoming bigger every day. The hospital and its surroundings knew of a kind-hearted "Sister Wang." In April 1985, Wang Shoulan used her earnings to buy a car and also started a passenger transport business, earning tens of thousands of yuan each month.

"You've suffered so much in the past, now that you have money, you should enjoy it yourself," many people advised her. But Wang Shoulan said, "I am an orphan raised by society, and now that I am rich, I should take more responsibility for society." In January 1985, Wang Shoulan met 75-year-old Du Wenzong at the Xinshun Street Office, who had come to apply for assistance. When she heard that the old lady had no children and made a living by selling small books, and that her life was miserable in winter, she happily took the old lady into her home. Over the years, Wang Shoulan also adopted three more babies: one found in a toilet, one thrown out of the obstetrics hospital by someone else, and another whose mother had died, father was in prison, and who was wandering the streets. Wang Shoulan named them Wang Fu, Wang Le, and Wang Ping, respectively. She said, "This means we were poor in the past, now we are rich, and everyone can live happily and safely together." Now, the 8-year-old eldest, Wang Ping, is studying in a key school, and the 6-year-old Wang Qiong is in the city's children's palace. The little girl who came to Beijing with Wang Shoulan for the meeting is Wang Qiong. The other two children, aged 4 and 2, have a nanny hired by Wang Shoulan to take care of them. In addition to the four children, Wang Shoulan has voluntarily taken in 20 elderly people (including one disabled person), one disabled youth, and two delinquent youths. Wang Shoulan lives frugally, but for social welfare, she is always generous. In 1986, she donated 100,000 yuan to the Jilin Provincial Children's Welfare Fund. In April 1988, Wang Shoulan invested in building the first private welfare home in Changchun, purchasing televisions, refrigerators, electric fans, tape recorders, and washing machines for the elderly. The elderly said, "We never thought that without children, we could enjoy such happiness in our old age."

In Changchun, many people call Wang Shoulan the "second bureau of civil affairs." Currently, Wang Shoulan has raised 10 million yuan to build a 6-story, 3,000-square-meter "Changchun Shoulan Yimin Welfare Building," planning to open a nursing home and kindergarten. She said, "In the future, when I hire employees, I will hire more delinquent youths because they need society's care."

　　王守兰——长春“第二民政局”
    郑宏范
    初春的北京乍暖还寒，在此出席中国企业管理协会女企业家协会第三次理事会的代表中，有一位带着个活泼可爱的小女孩的代表。她就是长春益民副食品商店经理王守兰。
    心宽体胖的王守兰短发微烫，带一副黑边眼镜，身上蓝、黑、红三色相间的运动服为年届５０的她平添了几多朝气。如果说从其发福的体态你或许还能窥出她的富裕，那么，仅凭外表你却很难臆见一位普普通通的妇女艰辛坎坷的一生，以及她奉献给我们社会的广博的爱。
    王守兰是个孤儿，没有结过婚，但她却是个庞大家庭的当家人。这个家共有２８口人，２３个姓。除王守兰外，其他人以前或是鳏寡孤独，或是残疾青年，或是被人遗弃的婴孩，或是流浪街头的乞儿。
    想起来是那么遥远。１９４６年，肆虐的鼠疫夺去了王守兰父母的生命，５岁的她被卖去做童养媳。解放后，党和政府送她进孤儿院，上学读书。１９６３年，王守兰由吉林师范大学体育系毕业。到吉林省教育厅工作。“文革”中，她蒙受不白之冤，被判处２０年有期徒刑，进了监狱。１９８０年，党和政府为她落实政策，王守兰得以平反出狱。
    她从磨难中悟出爱与人生的真谛。她爱社会，爱周围的人，为国家、为他人分忧解难是她最大的快乐。
    １９８２年，王守兰得知乡下的叔叔孑然一身，生活困难，便赶去把老人接到她位于长春妇产科医院对面的家中一起生活。
    次年一个夏日的清晨，窗外噪杂的人语夹杂着一个婴儿嘶哑的啼哭。王守兰走出门来，只见人群中间一清洁工抱着从垃圾箱捡到的身上长着两个大瘤子的嗷嗷待哺的女婴。“多可怜呀，我来养她！”从此，每月６２元的工资要养活自己和一老一小，还要为婴儿看病，生活煞是窘迫。王守兰给贫困中捡来的小生命取名“王琼”，是当时家庭生活贫寒的意思。
    家门口妇产科医院的病人不能及时买到红糖、卫生纸而有诸多不便。为方便姊妹们，也为了一家三口的生计，１９８３年末，王守兰借款５００元，在自家的窗口挂上了“益民日杂店”的牌子，卖些红糖、鸡蛋、卫生纸等。小店每天凌晨４点开门，直到夜晚十一、二点关门。她卖鸡蛋，每个比别人便宜５分钱；她熬小米粥，免费供给孕妇、病人。经年累月，小店声誉渐高，生意日隆，小本生意滚雪球似地一天比一天大，医院远近都知道有个热心肠的“王大姐”。１９８５年４月，王守兰又用挣的钱买来汽车兼搞客运，每月能挣上万元。
    “你过去吃了那么多苦，现在有了钱，自己该好好享受享受了。”许多人以此言相劝。可王守兰说：“我是社会抚养长大的孤儿，我富了，应该为社会尽更多的责任。”１９８５年１月，王守兰在新春街办事处遇见前来申请补助的７５岁的杜文宗老太太。当她听说老太太膝下无儿无女，平日靠摆小人书摊度日，冬天生活苦不堪言的情况，欣然把老太太接到自己家中。几年来，王守兰又先后收养了三个婴孩，一个是从厕所里捡的，一个是别人从妇产医院里扔出来的，另一个是妈妈离世、爸爸入狱、自己流浪街头的小可怜。王守兰分别给他们取名为：王富、王乐、王平。她说：“这叫过去穷，现在富，大家在一起快快乐乐、平平安安。”现在，８岁的老大王平在重点学校读书，６岁的王琼进了市少年宫。这次和王守兰一起来北京开会的就是王琼。另外两个４岁、２岁的孩子，王守兰也专门请了保姆照看他们。现在，除了４个孩子，王守兰义务收养的还有２０位老人（其中１位残疾）、１个残疾青年、２个失足青年。王守兰平日生活克勤克俭，但为了社会福利事业她却总是慷慨解囊。１９８６年，她为吉林省儿童福利基金会捐款１万元。１９８８年４月，王守兰自己投资兴建了长春第一家个体福利院，为鳏寡老人们购买了彩电、冰箱、电风扇、录音机、洗衣机等设备。老人们说：“没想到我们无儿无女的，老了还能享这样的福。”
    在长春，许多人管王守兰叫“第二民政局”。眼下，王守兰已自筹资金１００万元，计划兴建一幢６层、３０００平方米的“长春守兰益民福利大楼”，开养老院，办幼儿园。她说：“以后我招收职工，将多招失足青年，因为，他们需要社会的关心。”
