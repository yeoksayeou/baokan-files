The desire for beauty is universal. The reform and opening-up policy has stimulated the public's demand for beauty salons and cosmetics, fostering the development of the cosmetics industry. In 1982, there were only about 200 cosmetics production enterprises nationwide, with an annual output value of 200 million yuan and negligible foreign exchange earnings from exports.

By the end of 1988, the number of production enterprises had surged to over 2,000, a tenfold increase; the annual output value reached 1.7 billion yuan; and the export earnings amounted to 50 million US dollars.

According to a responsible person from the Ministry of Light Industry, currently, China has most of the beauty salon and cosmetic products available internationally. There are 400,000 beauty salon and cosmetic service points nationwide, with 700,000 professionals in the field. To guide people in properly enhancing their lives, China will hold a beauty salon and cosmetics festival in Beijing in July.

　　美发美容美化生活
　　７０万从业者为人们梳妆打扮
    本报北京４月１７日讯　记者刘霄报道：爱美之心人皆有之。改革开放催生了群众的美发美容需求，也促进了化妆品行业的发展。１９８２年，全国仅有２００来家化妆品生产企业，年产值２亿元，出口创汇额微不足道。
    １９８８年底，生产厂家猛增１０倍，达２０００余家；年产值达１７亿元；创汇５０００万美元。
    据轻工业部负责人今天介绍，目前，国际上有的美发美容品种，我国基本上都有了。全国有美发美容网点４０万个，从业人员达７０万人，为引导人们正确地美化生活，我国将于７月在京举办美发美容节。
