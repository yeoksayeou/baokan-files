	Hu Yaobang and the Japanese Chess Saint

	I do not know how well Hu Yaobang comrade plays Go, but I often hear from chess players that this politician, who has influenced the world, also has a corner of his heart devoted to the black and white world.

	Last spring, a famous eight-segment chess player told me. He said that when he visited Hu Yaobang, they were discussing the Japanese honorary chess saint Fujisawa Shuko. The young eight-segment player said that Fujisawa was suffering from cancer and had undergone two surgeries. The visiting chess players saw that the old man was very weak, and it was said that the cancer cells had spread to his neck. Hu Yaobang was silent for a long time and sighed deeply. The eight-segment player added that every spring, Fujisawa would lead a team of young chess players to China at his own expense to play with Chinese chess players, calling it the "Fujisawa Brigade." This time, the old man's body had improved, so he organized the team again, which was likely to be the last time. At this time, Hu Yaobang slowly nodded, praising this respectable old man. He also said that during Fujisawa's visit to China, it would not be convenient to arrange a meeting. Looking at the eight-segment player's spectacles and refined appearance, he said, "I don't know if you can help me deliver a gift? I have already prepared it, and it is quite heavy." It turned out that Hu Yaobang wanted to give Fujisawa, who loves Chinese culture, a newly published calligraphy collection, "Sanxi Tang Calligraphy."

	Later, this politician's gift was delivered by the young chess player on a bicycle.

	This early spring, everyone was guessing whether Nie Weiping would appear in the fifth round of the China-Japan Go match, but a famous coach told me that Nie Weiping would definitely appear. At that time, it was only rumored that Deng Xiaoping had sent a message during the South-North Nine-Segment Rapid Chess Match in Jiading. Who would have thought that during the Spring Festival, Nie Weiping was on vacation in Guangxi, where he would meet Hu Yaobang, who was also resting there? Hu Yaobang seriously told Nie Weiping in a long conversation, "I have an opinion, I have considered it for a week, it is better for you to appear." Indeed, soon, Nie Weiping's name was prominently listed on the Chinese team.

	Politicians and chess players, in the eyes of ordinary people, are so far apart! But Hu Yaobang and the two outstanding chess players from China and Japan are all tenacious fighters in life. In this sense, their hearts are connected, right? Now, Hu Yaobang has suddenly left us. Who can know what kind of feeling Fujisawa will have when he looks at the "Sanxi Tang Calligraphy," and what kind of feeling Nie Weiping will have when he leads his army to attack Japan?

　　胡耀邦与中日棋圣
    我不知道胡耀邦同志的围棋下得如何，却常常从棋界人士的口里，知道这位俯仰世界风云的政治家，似乎也留出心中的一角关心着黑白天地。
    去年春天，是一位著名的八段棋手告诉我的。他说他去探望胡耀邦同志时，正谈起日本名誉棋圣藤泽秀行先生。年轻的八段说，秀行先生身患癌症，经两次手术。访日的棋手见到老人已十分衰弱，据说癌细胞已扩展到了颈部。胡耀邦沉默良久，深深叹息。那位八段又补充说，每年春天，藤泽秀行都要率青年棋手自费来华与中国棋手会弈，称之曰“秀行兵团”。这次老人身体有所好转，便又组队，很可能是最后一回了。这时，胡耀邦同志慢慢地点头，称赞藤泽这位可尊敬的老人。又说在秀行访华时，不便安排会见。他看着八段戴着眼镜文质彬彬的模样说：“不知你能否替我转送一件礼物？我早已准备下了，份量很重的呢。”原来，胡耀邦同志想送给喜爱中国文化的藤泽秀行一套新出版的书法名集《三希堂法帖》。
    后来，这位政治家的礼物，是那位年轻的棋手用自行车驮去的。
    今年初春，大家正在猜测聂卫平是否会在第五届中日擂台赛上出战，一位著名的教练却告诉我，聂卫平肯定会出场。当时，只风闻在嘉定南北九段快棋对抗赛时，邓小平同志曾传过话。谁料春节时，聂卫平在广西休假，会遇上也在那里休养的胡耀邦呢？胡耀邦在长谈中郑重地对聂卫平说：“我提供个意见，反复考虑了一个星期，你还是出场为好”。果然不久，聂卫平在中方名单上赫然挂帅。
    政治家与棋手，在一般人眼中相去何其远！但是胡耀邦与中日两位杰出的棋手，都是人生的顽强的斗士，在这一点上，他们的心是相通的吧？而今，胡耀邦同志突然离去了，谁能知道，藤泽秀行展抚《三希堂法帖》，聂卫平率军东征扶桑，会有怎样一种心情呢？	　　　　　　胡廷楣　原载４月１８日《解放日报》
