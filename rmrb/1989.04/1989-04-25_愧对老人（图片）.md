In the southwestern corner of the hill in Kangling Village, Rongmei Town, Hubei Province's Hucheng County, there lives a 75-year-old man named Wang Chengfu. He lives alone in a thatched hut. He has five sons and one daughter. His wife passed away many years ago, and he raised his six children through hardship. His eldest son is serving a sentence and has not returned. The second and third sons have their own families and live half a mile away from the old man's thatched hut. His daughter is married, and his two younger sons are in their twenties, working on side jobs outside. The old man was once a military family member and originally had two brick houses built with help from the state and the collective. In 1983, his second son demolished these houses to use the materials for his own home renovation. Unable to bear the abuse from his second son and daughter-in-law, the old man built a thatched hut on the hill to live in (middle picture). He sleeps on a bed made of stones, wooden planks, and sticks. Meanwhile, his second and third sons live in spacious wooden houses with tiled roofs (bottom picture). For over three months, none of his children or daughters-in-law have visited him. The old man makes a living by cutting bamboo from the mountain, weaving baskets to sell, and then buying grain to eat (top picture).

    愧对老人
    湖北鹤峰县容美镇康岭村四组西南角的半山上，有位75岁的王成富老人，孑然一身，住在一间茅草棚里。他有5男1女，老伴去世多年，他含辛茹苦把6个儿女拉扯成人。长子服刑未归，老二老三已成家，住在离老人茅草棚半里路远的地方，女儿已出嫁，两个小儿子都已20多了，在外搞副业。老人曾是军属，原有国家和集体帮修的两间瓦房，1983年二儿子翻修房屋需料用给拆了。老人因受不了二儿子和媳妇的气，在这半山上搭了个茅草棚栖身（中图）。睡的是石头撑木柴棍搭的床，二儿子、三儿子住的却都是宽敞的木板瓦房（下图），3个多月来，儿子媳妇们从不去探望老人一眼，老人靠砍山竹编撮箕卖，然后买粮糊口（上图）。
