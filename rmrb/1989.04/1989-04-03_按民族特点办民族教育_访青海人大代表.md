	Implementing Education Tailored to Ethnic Characteristics
	— An Interview with Qinghai People's Congress Representatives

	By Gao Xinqing, Reporter for People's Daily

	Qinghai Province is a multi-ethnic region with 33 ethnic minorities. Out of the province's 4.34 million population, 1.74 million are ethnic minorities, accounting for 40% of the total population. In the province's 720,000 square kilometers, ethnic minority residential areas occupy 96%. Developing ethnic education is of great political and economic significance for such a multi-ethnic province.

	Banma Danzeng, a National People's Congress representative and Qinghai's deputy governor in charge of education (Tibetan), told the reporter, "Comparing with the past, our ethnic education has made significant progress. Before liberation, the province had only 109 ethnic primary schools with over 4,900 students. In the 8 ordinary middle schools and normal schools, there were very few ethnic minority students, and only 140 ethnic minority teachers. Starting from this foundation, by the end of 1988, the province had 1,504 standalone ethnic schools, accounting for 33.5% of the total number of schools in the province. Among these, there are 2 ethnic colleges, 7 ethnic vocational schools, 55 ethnic middle schools, and 1,440 ethnic primary schools. Including those in ordinary schools, there are 250,000 ethnic minority students in school, accounting for 29% of the total number of students in the province. The ethnic education system from primary school to university has taken initial shape." Banma Danzeng particularly refuted the claim that there is no culture in Tibetan regions. He said, "Tibetan education has advanced to an unprecedented scale. Tibetan primary schools have increased from 14 at the beginning of liberation to 727. Tibetan middle schools have increased from none to 32. Henan Mongol Autonomous County, which originally had no Mongolian-language primary schools, now has 3."

	"But there are still significant problems and gaps. Primary education, especially basic education, is quite weak; teaching quality is poor, there is a shortage of teachers, and school conditions are poor..." Banma Danzeng listed one by one.

	"Some ethnic minority regions still have not solved the problem of basic sustenance, and it is even harder for the masses to raise funds for education. I solemnly suggest that the State Council organize the State Education Commission, State Ethnic Affairs Commission, Ministry of Personnel, Ministry of Finance, and other departments to convene a meeting on ethnic minority education as soon as possible to conduct a special study on the current situation, difficulties, and development of ethnic minority education, and propose practical solutions." Ma Yufen, deputy director of the Qinghai Women's Federation and a former teacher (Hui), took over and quickly proposed her suggestions.

	"I think we should implement ethnic education tailored to ethnic characteristics, so that it can be done well," said Tong Chengrong, county magistrate of Huzhu Tu Autonomous County (Tu), emphasizing, "We lack teachers and their quality is low. If we overly emphasize teaching according to the curriculum, it will not work, and the number of students entering school will decrease, and dropouts will increase. It is not easy for ethnic minority students to overcome the language barrier. I suggest some pre-school education; the state should allocate special funds for ethnic minority education; ethnic minority teachers can also be recruited and allocated in a targeted manner."

	"Investment should be focused on the key areas. Education funds are already insufficient, and more vocational high schools and secondary technical education should be established in ethnic minority regions." After People's Congress representative and senior engineer Qian Guoying finished speaking, Ma Yufen quickly agreed, "I agree. The 6 girls' middle schools for Hui and Salar ethnicities have few students who go to college. It would be better to set up vocational classes in these schools and let the students master one or two skills."

	Qian Guoying said, "This session of the People's Congress proposed a motion to establish intelligence development centers in ethnic minority regions, and I hope the State Education Commission and the Ministry of Finance will consider adopting it."

	Banma Danzeng summarized three points: When the Party's ethnic policies are seriously implemented, ethnic education will be valued, and the development speed will accelerate; otherwise, it will stagnate or even regress. When we do not implement a one-size-fits-all approach, ethnic education will develop healthily and steadily; otherwise, it will experience ups and downs. When we respect the characteristics of ethnic schools and teach according to individual needs, teaching will be full of vitality; otherwise, it will be full of difficulties.

　　按民族特点办民族教育
    ——访青海人大代表
    本报记者  高新庆
    青海省是一个有３３个少数民族的多民族地区。全省４３４万人口中，少数民族有１７４万，占总人口４０％；全省７２万平方公里面积中，少数民族居住地区却占９６％。发展民族教育，对这样一个多民族省具有十分重大的政治、经济意义。
    全国人大代表、分管教育的青海省副省长班玛旦增（藏族）对记者说，自己同自己比，我们的民族教育有了长足的进步。解放前夕，全省只有民族小学１０９所，学生４９００多名；在８所普通中学和师范学校中，少数民族学生寥寥无几，少数民族教师只有１４０多名。在这个基础上起步，到１９８８年底，全省已有单设的民族学校１５０４所，占全省学校总数的３３．５％，其中民族高校２所，民族中专７所，民族中学５５所，民族小学１４４０所。包括进入普通学校的，少数民族在校学生共有２５万人，占全省在校学生总数２９％。从小学到大学的民族教育体系已初具规模。班玛旦增特别驳斥了所谓藏族地区没有文化的说法。他说，藏族教育以前所未有的规模前进。藏族小学由解放初１４所，发展到７２７所；藏族中学从无发展到３２所。河南蒙古族自治县，原来没有蒙族语小学，现在办了３所。
    “但是存在的问题和差距还比较大，基础教育特别是小学教育相当薄弱；教学质量差、师资不足、办学条件差……”班玛旦增一一列举着。
    “少数民族地区还有一部分没解决温饱问题，群众集资办学难度更大。我郑重建议国务院组织国家教委、国家民委、人事部、财政部等部门尽快召开少数民族地区教育工作会议，对少数民族教育的现状、困难和发展进行专题研究，并提出切实的解决办法。”青海省妇联副主任、当过教师的马玉芬（回族）接过话茬一口气提出了自己的建议。
    “我认为要按民族特点办民族学校，这样才能办好”，互助土族自治县县长童成荣（土族）强调说，我们那里师资缺，素质低，过分强调按教学大纲办，一是行不通，二是进校学生少，流失生反会增多。少数民族学生过语言关不容易，建议搞一点学前教育；国家对少数民族地区教育经费搞专项拨款；少数民族师资还可采取定向招生、定向分配。
    “投资要用在刀刃上，本来教育经费不足，少数民族地区应多办职业中学，多办中等技术教育。”人大代表、高级工程师钱国英刚说完，马玉芬抢着说：“我同意，不能搞一刀切。６所回族、撒拉族女子中学，考大学的少嘛，还不如在这些学校办职业班，让学生掌握一二门技术。”
    钱国英说：“这次人代会提了一个提案，在少数民族地区设智力开发中心，请国家教委、财政部考虑采纳。”
    班玛旦增最后概括三点：什么时候党的民族政策得到认真贯彻，民族教育就会受到重视，发展速度就会加快；反之，就会徘徊不前，甚至倒退。什么时候不搞“一刀切”，民族教育就会健康稳步发展；反之，就会大起大落。什么时候尊重民族学校的特点因人施教，教学才有活力；反之，就会困难重重。
