	Some people gathered at Xinhuamen attempting to enter Zhongnanhai
	Beijing Municipal Government Points Out That Storming Party and Government Offices Is Illegal

	According to a report by the Beijing Daily, in recent days, people in Beijing have held various activities in schools and grassroots units to mourn the passing of Comrade Hu Yaobang. However, on the evening of the 18th and the morning of the 19th, abnormal situations occurred at Xinhuamen, where some people gathered and attempted to storm Zhongnanhai.

	At 10:50 PM on the 18th, these people gathered at Xinhuamen, shouting loudly and causing disorder, blocking traffic on Chang'an Street. Around midnight, some people, ignoring the efforts of on-duty armed police to stop them, shouted and rushed towards Xinhuamen, attempting to enter Zhongnanhai. Among the crowd, some people threw bottles and shoes. According to eyewitnesses at the scene, a face of an on-duty armed police soldier was injured.

	At 4:20 AM, the Beijing Municipal Government broadcasted a notice at the scene, pointing out that storming party and government offices is illegal and unacceptable under the law. This is no longer a normal activity to mourn Comrade Hu Yaobang. The notice required the crowd to leave the scene to maintain normal work and traffic order.

	Many onlookers at the scene believed that the wrongful action of storming Zhongnanhai actually interfered with the mourning activities. Currently, there are indeed a very few people deliberately stirring up trouble, and we must be vigilant about this. They said, we should cherish the current stable and united political situation, turn grief into strength, and use actual actions to promote reform and modernization to mourn Comrade Hu Yaobang.

	Around 5:00 AM, under the persuasion and guidance of workers and on-duty armed police, the people gathered at Xinhuamen gradually left, and traffic on West Chang'an Street returned to normal.

　　一些人围聚新华门试图冲入中南海
　　北京市政府指出冲击党政机关是违法的
    新华社北京４月２０日电　据《北京日报》报道：连日来北京市人民群众分别在学校和基层单位举行各种活动，哀悼胡耀邦同志的逝世。但是，１８日晚和１９日晨在新华门前发生了不正常的情况，一些人围聚在那里并冲击中南海。
    １８日晚１０时５０分，这些人来到新华门前，高声呼喊，秩序一片混乱，堵塞了长安街的交通。零时许，有些人不顾值勤武警的拦阻，呼叫着拥向新华门，试图冲入中南海。人群中有人扔汽水瓶和鞋子。据现场目击者说，一名值勤的武警战士面部被砸伤。
    ４时２０分，北京市人民政府在现场广播了通告，指出冲击党政机关是违法的，是法制不能允许的，这已不是正常的悼念胡耀邦同志的活动。通告要求在场人群离开现场，以维护正常工作秩序和交通秩序。
    在场围观的许多群众认为，冲击中南海的错误行动，实际上是对悼念活动的干扰。目前确有极少数人蓄意挑起事端，对此我们要保持警惕。他们说，我们应珍惜当前安定团结的政治局面，要化悲痛为力量，用搞好改革和现代化建设的实际行动悼念胡耀邦同志。
    清晨５时许，在工作人员、值勤武警的劝说和疏导下，围聚在新华门前的人逐渐离去，西长安街交通恢复正常。
