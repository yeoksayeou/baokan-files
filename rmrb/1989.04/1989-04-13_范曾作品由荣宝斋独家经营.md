Famous painter Fan Zeng recently reached an agreement with Renhua Gallery, a store with a history of several hundred years, stipulating that his paintings will be exclusively managed by Renhua Gallery in China from now on. Fan Zeng reiterated that he will no longer sell paintings privately.

This professor from the Department of Oriental Art at Nankai University believes that the purpose of this arrangement is, first, to prevent forgeries of his works from appearing in the market, and second, to ensure that part of the income from selling his paintings can truly be turned over to the state. He said that in recent years, the market for Chinese paintings has been chaotic, with many forgeries of famous painters circulating in domestic and international markets. This not only damages the reputation of the painters but also prevents Chinese painting art from achieving its due status in the world. At the same time, due to some painters selling paintings privately and some lawless elements taking advantage of this, the state has lost tax revenue that it should have received.

Renhua Gallery will manage 30 of Fan Zeng's works this year, all of which come with catalogs of the sold works and certificates of authenticity. The person in charge of Renhua Gallery told reporters that last year, Renhua Gallery sold nearly 20 of Fan Zeng's works, and the foreign exchange collected by the state from this was quite substantial.

　　范曾作品由荣宝斋独家经营
    据新华社北京电　著名画家范曾日前和有着数百年历史的荣宝斋画店达成协议，商定他的绘画作品从现在起，在国内将由荣宝斋独家经营，范曾重申他今后一律不私下卖画。
    这位南开大学东方艺术系教授认为，他这样做的目的，一是为了防止他的伪作在市场上出现，二是为了使自己卖画所得的一部分能真正上交国家。他说，近年来，国画市场混乱，许多名画家的伪作在国内外市场流通，这不仅损害了画家声誉，也使中国画艺术在世界上得不到应有的地位。同时，由于一些画家私下卖画和一些不法分子在其中作祟，使国家损失了应得的税收。
    荣宝斋今年经营范曾作品的数目为30幅，全部都附有出售作品的图录和真迹证书。荣宝斋的负责人告诉记者，去年荣宝斋出售范曾作品近20幅，国家从中收取的外汇相当可观。
