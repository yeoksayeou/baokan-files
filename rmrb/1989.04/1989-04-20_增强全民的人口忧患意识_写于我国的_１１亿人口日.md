Now, our country has a population of 1.1 billion. This two-digit number in the billions must be given high attention and cannot be taken lightly. This number indicates: (1) By the end of this century, our country's total population will equal the combined population of all developed countries; (2) Our country's population will find it difficult to stop growing within half a century. Even if growth can be stopped, the population will certainly exceed 1.5 billion. How much it will exceed depends on the effectiveness of our future family planning work; (3) In half a century, our country will still be the most populous country in the world. We will have to develop and compete internationally under conditions of low population quality and less than one acre of arable land per capita. All of this means that our descendants will face even more severe and harsh population, resource, and environmental conditions. We must plan for this early.

Raising Population Awareness

A large population, a weak foundation, low population quality, uneven population distribution, and high population density are the prominent features of our national conditions. This population situation should form a strong consciousness of population control (this article's population awareness refers to this). From macro-level decision-making to micro-level family and individual behavior, everyone must always, in all matters and situations, think about the need for our country to strictly control population growth and improve population quality.

However, this population awareness has been very weak in the past and is still insufficient today.

Our country's past weak population awareness has deep historical, social, and ideological roots. China has long been in an agricultural society dominated by manual labor, with natural economy and feudal ideology dominating. Under these social conditions, a large population means more labor and more ways to make money. The idea that "more people means more blessings" has a deep foundation. At the founding of the nation, our country already had over 500 million people, but due to the persistence of traditional ideas, the emphasis was on population growth being a sign of socialist superiority. The correct view of controlling population growth was criticized as heresy, labeled as "Malthusianism," "idealism," "population determinism," and "environmental determinism," and so on. Under the guidance of "leftist" ideology, it was even claimed that the more people there are, the faster the growth, the better it is for building socialism quickly, efficiently, and economically.

The Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee clearly shifted the focus of work to modernization construction and proposed building socialism with Chinese characteristics. It advocated emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, and everything from reality. It reaffirmed that practice is the sole criterion for testing truth and criticized rigid, dogmatic thinking. People increasingly recognized that in the process of achieving the Four Modernizations, a large population is not a good thing because a large population does not mean high productivity. Only when people with a certain level of quality combine with means of production and labor objects can productivity be formed. People began to dare to face the reality of our country's overpopulation and low population quality, and to recognize that this is not conducive to social development and the improvement of people's lives. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Party and the state have issued a series of policies on population and family planning, such as including the advocacy of family planning as a citizen's right and duty in the state constitution and marriage law; the Central Committee's open letter to Party and Youth League members on the population issue; summarizing our country's population policy as "controlling population quantity and improving population quality"; the report of the Twelfth Party Congress stating that population is always a very important issue in our country's social and economic development; and the report of the Thirteenth Party Congress further discussing population quantity, quality, population industry structure transformation, and population aging when comprehensively discussing the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics. All of this indicates that our country has a fairly strong population awareness in its guiding ideology.

In the current situation where China's society, economy, and culture are still backward, it is understandable that the general public, especially the broad masses of farmers, do not universally have this population awareness and require painstaking propaganda and education work. Unfortunately, in our macro-level decision-making and public opinion guidance, in many aspects, some leaders and intellectuals also show weak population awareness, which is worth our attention.

In the issue of population control, the fundamental interests of the state and society and the immediate interests of some families and individuals are in conflict. If timely measures can be taken before the third population peak arrives, through and implementing relevant national legislation, such as the "Family Planning Law," "Eugenics Law," and "Household Registration Law," this conflict can be somewhat resolved. However, due to insufficient recognition of the severity of the population problem, many places have relaxed family planning efforts at times. If this is not addressed, serious consequences will result.

The wisest strategic choice to overcome the unfavorable conditions of our country's large population, low population quality, and scarce per capita resources is to prioritize investment in human resources, greatly improve the quality of the workforce, and vigorously develop education. On the basis of universally improving population quality, cultivate more talents and leverage intellectual advantages. Only in this way can all available resources be fully utilized and a social environment and mechanism for consciously controlling population growth be created, turning disadvantages into advantages. However, our country has not long recognized the importance of education and science and technology development to this extent, which is another manifestation of weak population awareness.

The food problem of our country's population and the related issues of arable land, food, and agriculture have always been the most prominent problems. With such a large population, food cannot rely on imports, and the world cannot provide so much commercial grain. In this sense, our country's food problem is more acute than that of countries with higher population densities such as Japan, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Bangladesh. To solve the food problem, every inch of arable land should be cherished, agricultural infrastructure should be improved, and every possible effort should be made to protect the agricultural ecological environment and maintain continuous high yields. The collection, storage, management, transportation, and distribution of grain and other agricultural products should be meticulously planned, and no waste should be allowed. In recent years, our country's grain production has increased rapidly, and when the per capita grain reached 400 kilograms of raw grain, the surface phenomenon of difficulty in selling grain was misjudged. Some places relaxed their guidance on grain production, reduced the area sown with grain, significantly reduced agricultural investment, and did not pay due attention to the occupation of farmland for township enterprises and civilian housing, the blind development of the brewing industry, and other phenomena of wasting grain. This is another manifestation of weak population awareness.

Our country has a large population, a weak foundation, and a very unbalanced development of population and economic conditions in various regions. There is still a part of the population whose basic needs are not met. Our country's per capita resources are relatively scarce, so we must persist in the policy of hard work and thrift for several generations to overcome the difficulties of the entire nation. This is a logical conclusion derived from population awareness. However, in our country's previous period, in public opinion guidance and even some guiding ideologies, consumption was encouraged and promoted intentionally or unintentionally, leading to many consumption patterns that do not fit our national conditions. This is also a manifestation of weak population awareness.

The population issue is a very important issue in our country's development strategy. Many short-term behaviors in our country's Four Modernizations decision-making are also greatly related to the lack of population awareness. Therefore, the people of the entire country, especially the leaders at all levels of the Party and government, should raise their population awareness. This is a prerequisite for scientific decision-making and the correctness of macro-level guidance.

Establishing the Concept of Per Capita

Total indicators can reflect our country's overall national strength and the achievements of modernization construction. Emphasizing only this aspect can easily lead to illusions and fail to see the various difficulties brought by overpopulation, as well as the gap with foreign countries in per capita levels.

Enhancing the concept of per capita can help increase people's sense of crisis, urgency, and responsibility.

For a long time, people have liked to describe our country's national conditions with "vast territory and abundant resources" and "a large population," while paying little attention to per capita indicators. This is related to our country's traditional concepts and the statistical methods used. Total indicators can reflect our country's overall national strength, demonstrate the advantages of a country with a large population, show our country's ranking in national strength, and enhance national self-confidence. Our country's advantages of a large population and large total quantity are relatively easy to feel, but if only this aspect is emphasized, it can easily lead to illusions, making people fail to see the various difficulties brought by our country's overpopulation and the gap with foreign countries in per capita levels. Many of our country's products, such as coal, grain, and cotton, have the highest production in the world, and even the national income is also at the forefront of the world. However, if calculated by per capita indicators, they are at the bottom of the world. For example, our country's national income in 1988 was 1385.3 billion yuan, with a per capita income of only 1260 yuan. Although due to calculation methods, exchange rates, and purchasing power of currencies, this indicator is difficult to accurately compare with foreign countries, many statisticians and economists at home and abroad have confirmed that our country's ranking, among more than 150 countries and regions in the world, is in the last 1/5, only slightly higher than the least developed countries. Our country's per capita national income ranking has also declined in recent years, and the gap with other countries is widening. Many people are worried about this. The concept of per capita can help increase people's sense of crisis, urgency, and responsibility.

The simplest and most direct expression of the concept of per capita is to divide the total indicators of product production, national income, consumption funds, total grain production, national power generation, etc., by the population, i.e., using the population as the "denominator" to divide the product production or consumption as the "numerator." The backwardness of per capita indicators is primarily due to the backwardness of productivity, or the "numerator" is not large enough; but the large and continuously expanding population as the "denominator" is undoubtedly a factor that always hinders the improvement of per capita indicators. Some people think that the most important thing for our country is not the population control problem (denominator) but the problem of increasing production (numerator). This is a manifestation of insufficient recognition of the profound significance of controlling population numbers (denominator) to improve per capita indicators in our country at present. It is always the primary task to strive in every possible way to develop production (expand the numerator), otherwise the per capita indicators will become a source without water. However, it is also incorrect to emphasize production and ignore the impact of population on per capita production. Some people still think that increasing the population will also increase production (expand the numerator). This is not the case. The current situation in our country is: there is a relative surplus of labor, and the quality is not high, which cannot be well combined with means of production and raw materials to produce effective products. Therefore, increasing the population will only lead to a larger denominator, becoming an increasingly large obstacle to the growth of per capita indicators. In our country, no matter how large the production is, it will eventually be divided by 1.1 billion, 1.2 billion... 1.5 billion, and the average amount per person will not be much.

To deeply understand our national conditions, we should also apply the concept of per capita to concepts such as per capita wealth, per capita natural resources, and per capita social indicators.

One of the important signs of a weak foundation is that per capita wealth is small, specifically referring to per capita productive and non-productive basic construction being small, per capita material and technical equipment being low, per capita production tools being poor, per capita ownership of power, transportation, communication means, and energy being small, per capita living space being low, and per capita infrastructure being small, etc. These per capita wealth indicators, our country are all at the bottom of the world, which is an important manifestation of our country's low per capita production and consumption levels and cannot be changed in the short term.

The high and low of per capita production and development potential, from a long-term perspective, cannot but to a great extent depend on the abundance of per capita natural resources. Our country's per capita arable land, grassland, forest land, fresh water resources, and various mineral resources are all much lower than the world average per capita level. Arable land is only 1/3, forest land 1/9, fresh water resources 1/4, and many of the mineral resources that have been discovered are at the forefront of the world, but when calculated per capita, they are much lower than the world average level. Low per capita natural resources mean being at a disadvantage in competition. For example, our country's per capita arable land is only 1/9 of the United States, so there must be a huge gap in per capita production. Recognizing this, we must make the most of all our country's natural resources. It reminds people that any waste and destruction of resources are irresponsible to future generations.

The concept of per capita must also be extended to social indicators. Many social indicators with a per capita nature, such as the number of students at all levels per 10,000 people, the population illiteracy rate, the number of professionals per 10,000 people, the number of doctors, nurses, and hospital beds per 10,000 people, the number of various cultural and welfare institutions and facilities per 100,000 people, per capita education funds, and per capita medical and health care funds, our country's rankings in the world are all at the bottom. These all strongly illustrate that a large population has dragged down the development of our society.

Enhancing Strategic Vision

The contradictions in our country's economic development, the difficulties in economic reform, the obstacles in the construction of spiritual civilization and democratic legal system, and the enormous pressure on resources and ecological environment, although not all can be attributed to population, the large and fast-growing population indeed brings serious consequences to our country's society, economy, resources, and environment. This point has not been fully recognized by people. If we continue to be complacent, history will not forgive our generation.

Using the concept of per capita to argue for the necessity of controlling our country's population is convincing, and many people use the example of rapid population growth making it difficult to achieve a moderately prosperous life for the people by the end of this century. However, this is only a shallow understanding. Relative to the rate of production growth, the high population growth rate, and the effect of the "denominator" on the decline of per capita production, it is not easy to notice in the short term and only shows a huge difference after a relatively long period. To elucidate the necessity and urgency of controlling our country's population growth, a deeper understanding is needed.

From an economic perspective, on a large population base, if a large number of new populations continue to be added each year, then in the use and distribution of national income, it will hinder the expansion of reproduction, make it difficult to improve the lives of existing populations, and will continuously affect the enthusiasm of workers, ultimately endangering the development of production. Our country's funds, resources, and the quality of workers determine the limit of our country's demand for the employed population, while the supply of labor is almost unlimited. The employment arrangement of our country's surplus population has already formed an economic problem. It cannot but hinder technological updates, technological modernization, and the improvement of economic benefits. It is difficult to balance economic efficiency and social equality, and the difficulties of breaking the "iron rice bowl" and egalitarianism in distribution will inevitably bring many unexpected difficulties to economic reform. A large population base and rapid growth will inevitably exacerbate the long-standing supply-demand contradictions in our country, especially the contradictions between the basic needs of people's lives such as housing construction, grain, food supply, transportation, childcare, hospitals, etc., and a large population.

From the perspective of social life, a large and fast-growing population will also bring great difficulties to the construction of spiritual civilization and democratic legal system. First, the investment in education and health care cannot keep up with the growth of the population and the need to make up for the "debt" of the original population, making it difficult to quickly improve the population quality and even deteriorate. Especially because the birth rate in vast rural areas and remote, backward regions is much higher than in cities and developed regions, it causes the proportion of the new generation in rural and remote poor areas to increase, and the quality of the population is even worse. The consequence is that our country's average population quality faces the crisis of structural decline. On the other hand, a large number of surplus rural populations will inevitably flow into cities, which will exacerbate the unemployment problem in cities and put enormous pressure on urban infrastructure and social order, which is obviously not conducive to social stability and unity.

The pressure on resources and ecological environment is the most severe and far-reaching impact of a large and fast-growing population, but it is also the easiest to be overlooked. The destruction of resources and ecological environment cannot all be attributed to population growth, some of which are caused by natural disasters and human misconduct. However, in our country's case, many human behaviors that destroy resources and ecological environment are directly or indirectly due to population growth. Such as the reckless cultivation of land, such as deforestation for cultivation, steep slope cultivation, and reclamation of lakes for farmland; the reckless cultivation of grasslands and overgrazing leading to land desertification; cutting down forests for living energy, housing, and living supplies, leading to a decrease in forest coverage; using agricultural straw as living fuel and not returning it to the field, leading to a decrease in soil organic matter; a large population using water, leading to water scarcity in many places, a decrease in groundwater level, land subsidence, and secondary salinization of farmland; long-term monoculture of grain crops, in order to increase grain production, applying a large amount of fertilizers and pesticides to farmland, etc., leading to soil compaction, soil pollution, and soil fertility decline, etc. All of these, the deep-rooted cause is the human behavior caused by the survival of a large population. Other examples include poor mountain populations cutting down forests for immediate cash income; township enterprises, in order to accommodate the transfer of rural labor and get rich, waste resources, discharge three wastes, leading to various industrial pollutions, and urban air, garbage, and noise pollution, etc., the cause is also the excessive concentration of population producing various living pollution sources. The pressure that population exerts on resources and the environment is increased unknowingly, often at the expense of the interests of future generations.

The consequences that population brings to our country's society, economy, resources, and environment have not been fully recognized by people, and some have not been fully exposed. If we only pursue immediate interests, adopt short-term behaviors, and continue to be complacent, history will not forgive our generation.

　　增强全民的人口忧患意识    
    ——写于我国的“１１亿人口日”
    邬沧萍
    现在，我国已有１１亿人口。对于这个以“亿”为单位的两位数，确确实实有必要予以高度重视，不可等闲视之。这个数字预示：（１）到本世纪末，我国人口总数将等于所有发达国家人口的总和；（２）我国人口很难在半世纪内停止增长，即或能停止增长，届时人口肯定要超过１５亿，究竟超过多少，还要取决于我国今后的计划生育工作状况；（３）在半个世纪后，我国仍继续是世界人口最大国，我国将在人口素质还低，但人均耕地不到一亩的条件下发展、参与国际竞争。这一切意味着我们的子孙后代所面对的人口、资源、环境条件将更为严峻和苛刻。对此，不能不早为之计。
    提高人口意识
    人口多、底子薄，人口素质低，人口分布不均和密度高是我国国情的突出特点。这种人口处境，理应形成一种强烈的控制人口意识（本文人口意识指此）。从宏观决策到微观的家庭和个人行为，无论是谁，都应时时、事事、处处想到我国必须严格控制人口增长和提高人口素质。
　　然而，这种人口意识，不但过去十分薄弱，就是今天也很不够。
    我国过去人口意识薄弱，有其深刻的历史、社会和思想根源。中国长期处在以手工劳动为主的农业社会，自然经济和封建思想意识一直占统治地位。在这种社会条件下，人多意味着劳动力多，生财之道多，人多是好事，多子多福的思想有深刻的基础。建国之初，我国已有５亿多人口，但由于传统观念仍根深蒂固，强调人口多、增长快是社会主义优越性的表现，把控制人口的正确主张当作异端邪说，标之以“马尔萨斯主义”、“唯心主义”、“人口决定论”和“环境决定论”等等而加以批判，因而人口意识难以形成。在“左”的思想指导下，甚至反其道而行，断言：人口越多，增长越快，越能多、快、好、省地建设社会主义。
    党的十一届三中全会明确把工作着重点转移到现代化建设上来，提出建设有中国特色的社会主义；提出解放思想，实事求是，一切从实际出发的思想路线，重申实践是检验真理的唯一标准，批判本本主义的僵化思想。人们越来越认识到，在实现四化过程中，人多并不是好事，因为人口多并不意味生产力高，只有当具备一定素质的人口同生产资料和劳动对象结合起来，才能形成生产力。人们开始敢于正视我国人口过多和人口质量低的现实，并认识到这不利于社会的发展和人民生活的提高。十一届三中全会以来，党和国家在人口和计划生育方面发表了一系列有关的方针、政策，诸如，把有关提倡计划生育作为公民的权利和义务写在国家宪法和婚姻法内；党中央就人口问题对党团员发表的公开信；把我国人口政策概括为“控制人口数量和提高人口素质”；党的十二大报告作出：在我国社会经济发展中，人口始终是极为重要问题的立论，以及党的十三大报告在全面论述建设有中国特色的社会主义时，进一步谈到人口数量、质量、人口产业结构转移和人口老龄化等问题。这一切都标志着我国在指导思想上已有相当强烈的人口意识。
    在目前中国社会、经济、文化还处于落后状态的情况下，广大群众，特别是广大农民还不能普遍有这种人口意识，有待做艰苦细致的人口宣传教育工作，这是可以理解的。遗憾的是，在我们的宏观决策和舆论宣传中，在很多方面显露出一些领导人和在知识界中人口意识也很薄弱，这是值得我们重视的。
    在人口控制问题上，国家社会的根本利益和一部分人的家庭、个人的眼前利益是有矛盾的。如果能够不失时机地在第三个生育高峰来临之前，通过并实施有关的全国性立法，如“计划生育法”、“优生法”、“户口管理法”等，在一定程度上会有助于解决这个矛盾。但由于对人口问题的严峻性认识不足，不少地方对计划生育时紧时松，如不大力解决，将会产生严重后果。
    要摆脱我国人口多、人口文化低和人均资源少这种发展的不利条件，最明智的战略选择，就是对人力资源优先投资，使劳动力素质大大提高，也就是大力发展教育，在人口素质普遍提高的基础上培养出更多的人才，发挥智力优势。这样才可以充分利用一切可利用的资源和创造全社会自觉控制人口增长的环境和机制，变劣势为优势。然而，我国对教育和科技的发展，长期以来没有提到这样的高度来认识，这是人口意识薄弱的另一种表现。
    我国人口的吃饭问题及与此相联系的耕地、食物、农业问题，始终是个最突出的问题。我国人口这样多，粮食不可能依靠进口，世界上也不可能提供这样多的商品粮。因此，在这个意义上说，我国的粮食问题比人口密度高于我国的日本、荷兰、比利时、孟加拉等国家更为尖锐。为了解决吃饭问题，应该珍惜每一寸耕地，搞好农田基本建设，千方百计保护农业生态环境，保持持续的稳产高产，对粮食和其它农产品的收购、仓储、保管、运输、分配等精打细算，不允许有任何浪费。前几年，我国粮食产量有了较快增长，人均粮食刚达到４００公斤原粮时，对卖粮难的表面现象作了不正确的估计，有些地方在指导思想上放松了粮食生产，粮食播种面积减少，农业投入大幅度下降，对乡镇工业和民用住宅占用农田耕地，对盲目发展酿酒业，以及其它种种浪费粮食的现象也未给予应有的注意，这是人口意识淡薄的又一表现。
    我国人口多，底子薄，地区人口、经济状况发展很不平衡，仍有一部分人口温饱未能解决，我国人均资源又是相对贫乏，因此必须在几代人的时间内，坚持艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的方针，才能摆脱全民族的困境。这是人口意识必然引申出的逻辑结论。但是我国前一个时期，在舆论宣传甚至某些指导思想上，有意无意地鼓励和助长消费，其后果是导向许多不合国情的消费出现，这也是人口意识薄弱的一个表现。
    人口问题是我国发展战略中一个极为重要的问题，我国四化建设决策中出现的许多短期行为，与缺乏人口意识也有很大关系。因此，全国人民，特别是党政各级领导者都应该提高人口意识，这是决策科学化和宏观指导正确性的一个前提。
    确立人均观念
    总量指标能表明我国的总体国力，反映现代化建设的成就。只强调这一面也容易造成错觉，看不到人口过多带来的种种困难，以及与外国在人均水平上的差距。由于人口过多，我国在人均国民生产总值、产品产量、人均财富、自然资源、社会指标等方面，都处于世界各国和地区的后列。
    增强人均观念有助于增强人们的忧患意识，激发紧迫感和责任感。
    长期以来，人们总喜欢用地大物博、人口众多来描述我国的国情，而对人均指标却很不注意，这同我国传统观念和沿用的统计方法有关。用总量指标能表明我国的总体国力，能体现人口多的国家具有的某种优势，表现我国的国力位次，增强民族自信心。我国人口多、总量大的优势比较容易感受，但如果只强调这一面也容易造成错觉，使人们看不到我国人口过多带来的种种困难以及与外国在人均水平上的差距。我国很多产品产量如煤、粮、棉等已是世界之“最”，就是国民生产总值也居于世界前列，但用人均指标来计算，则位于世界后列。例如我国１９８８年的国民生产总值为１３８５３亿元，人均只有１２６０元。虽然由于计算方法、汇率、货币购买力等原因，这一指标很难确切同国外对比，但国内外很多统计学家、经济学家都肯定，我国的位次，在世界１５０多个国家和地区中，处在最后的１／５内，只略高于最不发达的国家。我国人均国民生产总值近几年位次又有所下降，同其它国家的差距有扩大的趋势。许多有识之士为此感到忧虑。人均观念有助于增强人们的忧患意识，激发人们的使命感和责任感。
    人均观念最简单、最直接的表述，就是把产品产量、国民生产总值、消费基金、粮食总产量、全国的发电量等总量指标用人口数来均分，即以人口数作为“分母”分摊作为分子的产品的产量或消费量。人均指标的落后，首先是由于生产力的落后，或说“分子”不够大；但作为“分母”的人口过大和不断膨胀，无疑是妨碍人均指标提高的永远起作用的因素。有人认为，我国重要的不是控制人口问题（分母），而是加大产量（分子）的问题。这是对我国当前控制人口数（分母）以提高人均指标的深远意义认识不足的表现。千方百计发展生产（扩大分子）在任何时候都是首要问题，不然人均指标成为无源之水。但只重视生产不重视人口对人均产量的影响也是不正确的。有的人还认为，增加人口同时也会增加产量（扩大分子）。实际不然，我国目前的情况是：劳动力相对过剩，质量不高，不能跟生产资料、原料很好结合，生产出有效产品。因此，增加人口只能导致分母越来越大，成为一个延缓人均指标增长的日益增大的阻力。在我国，无论多大的产量，终将要被１１亿、１２亿……１５亿来均分，每人平均的数量都多不了。
    要深刻认识我国国情，还应把人均观念应用到人均财富、人均自然资源和人均社会指标等概念上。
    底子薄的重要标志之一，就是人均财富少，具体指的是人均生产性和非生产性基本建设少，人均物质技术装备低、人均生产工具贫乏，人均拥有的动力、交通通讯手段和能源等少，人均居住面积低，人均基础设施少等等。这些人均财富指标，我国都居于世界后列，这是我国人均产量和人均消费水平低的重要表现，在短时期内是改变不过来的。
    人均产量高低和发展的潜力，从长远来看，不能不在很大程度取决于人均自然资源的多寡。我国人均的耕地、草原、林地、淡水资源和各种矿产资源等都大大低于世界按人口平均的水平。耕地只及１／３，林地１／９，淡水资源１／４，已探明的矿产资源很多居世界前列，但按人口平均计算，又大大低于世界平均水平。人均自然资源低意味着在竞争中处于劣势，例如我国人均耕地只及美国１／９，因而在人均产量上，不能不存在巨大的差距。认识到这点，就要最充分利用我国一切自然资源。它告诫人们，任何浪费和破坏资源都是对子孙后代不负责任的表现。
    人均概念还必须扩展到社会指标。许多带有人均性质的社会指标。诸如，每万人口的各级学生人数、人口的文盲率，每万人口的专业人员数，每万人口的医师、护士和病床数，每十万人口的各种文化、福利机构和设施数，人均的教育经费，人均的医疗保健费等等，我国在世界的位次都居后列。这些都有力地说明，人口多已拖住我国社会发展的后腿。
    增强战略眼光
    我国经济发展遇到的矛盾，经济改革产生的困难，精神文明建设和民主法制建设碰到的阻力，资源和生态环境承受的巨大压力，虽然不能都归因于人口，但是人口多，增长快确实对我国社会、经济、资源、环境带来严重的后果。这一点还未被人们充分注意。如果继续掉以轻心，历史将不会原谅我们这一代人。
    利用人均观念来论证我国控制人口的必要性是有说服力的，许多人都用人口增长过快，到本世纪末难以使人民生活达到小康水平作为例证。不过，这仅是一种浅层的认识。相对于产量增长率来说，人口增长率高，因此人均产量下降这种“分母”效应，在短期不容易察觉，要有较长时期才显出巨大差别。为了阐明我国控制人口增长的必要性和紧迫性，还需要有更深层的认识。
    从经济上看，在庞大的人口基数上，如果每年继续新增过多的人口，那么，为了抚养源源不断的新增人口，在国民收入的使用和分配上，就既妨碍扩大再生产，也难于改善已有人口的生活，又会不断影响劳动者的积极性，最终会危及生产的发展。我国的资金、资源和劳动者的素质决定了我国对就业人口需求的限度，而劳动力的供给又几乎是无限的。我国过剩人口的就业安排问题，已形成经济上的难题。它不能不妨碍技术更新、科技现代化和经济效益的提高。在经济效率和社会平等之间难于统筹兼顾，大锅饭和分配上的平均主义难于彻底破除，这必然对经济改革带来许多意想不到的困难。人口基数大，增长又快，势必加剧我国已经长期存在的供需矛盾，特别是与人民生活基本需要的吃穿用住烧产品和服务，诸如住宅建设、粮食、副食品供应、交通、托儿、医院等等与人口众多的矛盾。
    从社会生活来看，人口多、增长快对精神文明建设和民主法制建设也会带来很大的困难。首先是教育、卫生保健的投资跟不上人口增长和补偿原有人口“欠帐”的需要，使人口素质难以迅速改善甚至趋于恶化。特别是由于广大农村和边远、落后地区人口出生率大大高于城市和发达地区，造成新生一代在农村和边远贫穷地区人口比重提高，人口质量的底子和基础更差，其后果是我国人口平均质量面临结构性下降的危机。另一方面，农村大量的过剩人口必然会流入城镇，这就加剧城市的待业和失业问题，同时对城镇的基础设施和生活秩序施加巨大的压力，显然不利于社会的安定团结。
    人口多、增长快对我国资源和生态环境的压力最严重，影响最深远，但也是最容易被忽略。资源和生态环境遭受破坏并不能都归结于人口增长，有的是由于自然灾害和人类的不良行为造成的。但是在我国的情况下，破坏资源、生态环境的人类行为，许多都直接或间接归因于人口增长。土地的滥垦，如毁林开荒、陡坡开荒、围湖造田等；草原的滥垦、超载放牧导致土地沙化；砍伐森林作生活能源、盖房和生活用品，导致森林覆盖面积下降；农作物秫秸用作生活燃料不能还田，导致土地有机质降低；人口大量用水，导致许多地方淡水紧缺，地下水位下降、陆地下沉和耕地次生盐渍化；耕地长期单一种植粮食，为了增产粮食对耕地大量施用化肥、农药等等导致土地板结，土地污染和土地肥力下降等等。凡此种种，其深刻根源都是为了庞大人口的生存引起的人类行为。其它如山区贫困人口，为了眼前现金收入而采伐森林；乡镇工业为了容纳农村转移的劳动力和发财致富，滥用资源，排放三废，导致各种工业污染，以及城市的空气、垃圾、噪声污染等等，原因也是人口过分密集产生各种生活污染源引起的。人口对资源、环境施加的压力是不知不觉中加大的，常常以牺牲子孙后代的利益为代价。
    人口对我国社会、经济、资源、环境带来的后果，还未被人们充分认识，有的还未充分暴露。如果只顾眼前利益，采取短期行为，继续掉以轻心，历史将不会原谅我们这一代人。
