Recently, the Benxi City Min Sheng Primary School in Liaoning Province has required parents to contribute twenty bricks or one bag of cement within a week. Parents have had to find various ways to meet this demand. Some have taken materials from their work units, others have asked friends for help, and a few parents and students have even resorted to stealing from construction sites to meet the deadline and deliver the materials to the school.

    最近，辽宁省本溪市民生小学要家长必须在一星期内向学校交纳二十块砖头，或一袋水泥。家长们只好四处想方设法。有的从单位拿，有的跟关系户要，个别家长和学生干脆到建筑工地偷，如期送到学校。
