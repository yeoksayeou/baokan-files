Title: Behind the Lhasa Riots

The recent unrest in Lhasa raises a question that cannot be ignored: In recent years, the central government's policies towards Tibet have become increasingly practical, the economy has been steadily developing, people's living standards have significantly improved, and religious freedom has been fully guaranteed. However, over the past year, riots have occurred in Lhasa. Through this peculiar phenomenon, we see the activities of two foreign forces.

The two main foreign forces are the Tibetan separatist elements in exile; secondly, some foreign political forces and a few foreign organizations and individuals who claim to protect human rights.

These people, for their own reasons, do not want to see, or fear to see, a stable, united, and prosperous Tibet. Therefore, when Tibet's work in various aspects gradually improves, when scenes of Tibetan people living and working in peace are everywhere, when many countries' governments are further developing relations with China, when the international situation is moving from tension to relaxation and from confrontation to dialogue, these people become restless, feeling that the situation is increasingly unfavorable to them. They cannot wait to use various means to instigate riots in Tibet, attempting to achieve their unworthy goals.

Consider this:

The Chinese government's policy towards the Dalai Lama is clear: those who love the country are one family, loving the country has no precedence, past mistakes are not held against anyone, and as long as there are no actions that harm national unity and ethnic solidarity, freedom of movement is guaranteed. The channel for negotiations between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama has always been open, except for the issue of "Tibetan independence," all other issues can be discussed. However, the Tibetan separatist elements in exile see the central government's magnanimous policy as weakness. On one hand, they intensify their efforts to confuse and sway public opinion in some countries. On the other hand, they exploit the central government's policy of allowing overseas Tibetans to come and go freely, intensifying their efforts to incite unrest within Tibet, attempting to deceive the masses, put pressure on the central government, and attract the attention and support of some foreign forces, internationalizing the Tibetan issue.

In a few countries, there are political forces that habitually support the unpopular political forces in other countries. They use this to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and exert political pressure. They encourage Tibetan separatist elements to engage in political activities that are detrimental to China's unity and ethnic solidarity, and pass resolutions supposedly concerning "Tibetan human rights." From this, one naturally thinks of those who, in the past year and the year before, used the platforms of other countries to advocate for so-called plans and "new proposals" for "Tibetan independence"; one thinks of the disruptive and obstructive activities carried out by certain foreign forces around the time of China's peaceful liberation of Tibet in 1951; one also thinks of how some countries, until the PLA's advance into the Southwest, still harbored territorial ambitions towards China's Tibet, concocting the fallacy that the Chinese central government only had "suzerainty" over Tibet. People also remember that the armed rebellion launched by the upper echelons of the Tibetan separatist forces in March 1959 was carried out under the planning and command of certain foreign forces. In recent years, these foreign forces, feeling that openly advocating for "Tibetan independence" is too blatant, often use concern for "Tibetan human rights" as their shield. They have been very active recently. For example, they pass resolutions in parliaments that completely distort the situation in Tibet and openly interfere in China's internal affairs. They also exert influence and pressure on their own governments to intervene in China's internal affairs.

There are also a few human rights activists in the West who become important targets for the Tibetan separatist elements abroad. They consciously or unconsciously support the latter's separatist activities; under the guise of tourists and others, they enter Tibet to engage in various activities that harm the stability and unity of the region. They distort facts through news media and publications; during some international human rights conferences, they spread nonsense such as "Tibetan human rights are severely violated" and "Tibet and China have always been two different things."

Tibet has been a part of China since the 13th century. This is proven by countless Tibetan and Han historical relics. But they refuse to acknowledge this and have fabricated a "Tibetan history" that suits their conspiracy to split China.

The peaceful liberation of Tibet by China in 1951 was purely an internal affair. They, however, slander it as "aggression."

In 1959, the reactionary upper echelons of Tibet, in order to perpetuate the feudal serf system, launched an armed rebellion under the instigation of foreign forces. They, however, claim this was a "people's uprising."

In addition to reversing the truth on these three basic facts, they have repeatedly spread many absurd theories that defy common sense, such as:

Tibet's total population was 1 million in the 1953 national census, and including the Changdu region, which was placed under Tibet's jurisdiction in 1956, it was only about 1.27 million. Now, Tibet's population has increased to 2.07 million, but they fabricate that over 1 million people were killed in Tibet after liberation.

In Tibet, Han people make up only 3.62% (1986 statistics), and most of them are there to help with economic construction. The state's financial allocation to Tibet from 1952 to 1988 was 15.97 billion yuan, and not a single penny has been taken from Tibet's finances. They, however, concoct a "Greater Tibet," claiming that it has become a colony of Han people.

They are unwilling to face the facts of the Agreement between the Central People's Government and the Local Government of Tibet on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet signed on May 23, 1951, and the telegram sent by the Dalai Lama on October 24, 1951, expressing support for the agreement. In the telegram, the Dalai Lama said, "The local government of Tibet and the Tibetan monks and laypeople unanimously support this 'agreement signed by both sides on a friendly basis,' and under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, actively assist the PLA units entering Tibet to consolidate national defense, drive out imperialist forces from Tibet, and protect the unity of the country's territorial sovereignty." Obviously, these important documents are very unfavorable to their clamor for "Tibetan independence."

Before the democratic reforms in Tibet, the vast majority of serfs and slaves lived inhuman lives with no guarantee of personal safety. But those who claim to "care" about human rights in Tibet today do not want to touch the fact that Tibet had no human rights to speak of in the past. What does this say?

During the Cultural Revolution, many temples in Tibet were severely damaged. The feelings of the Tibetan people were hurt, which is a fact. But this damage was nationwide and is something that the Chinese government and the Chinese people feel deeply regretful about. In recent years, the main temples that were damaged have been or are being repaired. The aforementioned foreign political forces only mention in passing or do not want to mention our vigorous corrective measures. Why is this?

These people call those who engaged in arson, looting, and shooting in Lhasa, killing and injuring residents and police, criminals who violate the law, and call the necessary measures taken by our public security personnel to protect people's safety and property, and the legitimate measures taken by the Chinese government to maintain law and order, violations of human rights. What logic is this? What international law is this based on?

As for the foreign separatist forces sending people to enter the country to plan and create unrest, and smuggling weapons across the border, this further proves that the Lhasa unrest in early March this year was instigated by them.

In the past few years, tens of thousands of foreigners have visited Tibet. The vast majority of them believe that Tibet's development, changes, and progress are significant. As long as one does not have prejudices, one will see that the central government and the Tibet Autonomous Region government have done many practical things for the Tibetan people and are continuing to make efforts.

A few months ago, a high-ranking Western diplomat said that he stayed in Tibet for three weeks and visited many places. He saw that Tibet was peaceful, the Tibetan people lived in peace, were devoutly religious, and were not interested in politics, having no thoughts of independence at all. Those who have always advocated for Tibetan separatism are only a few people from a few major monasteries, who have always enjoyed privileges in the past.

Tibet needs reform and opening up, economic and educational development, improvement of people's lives, and further implementation of the central government's series of policies towards Tibet. There will inevitably be shortcomings, defects, or mistakes in various aspects of Tibet's work. If people from abroad truly care about Tibet's present and future, they should, like all Chinese people, including the Tibetan people, hope that Tibet has a stable and united environment conducive to construction and development. If they incite "Tibetan independence" or, under the guise of caring about human rights, instigate a few separatist elements to take violent actions, interfere in China's internal affairs, they are going against the historical trend, and the result will not be honorable.

### 拉萨骚乱的背后

　　拉萨骚乱的背后
　　田长进
    拉萨最近的骚乱，有一个不能不令人思考的问题：近年来，中央对西藏的政策越来越符合实际，西藏的经济在不断发展，人民生活明显提高，宗教信仰的自由得到充分保障，但是，这一年多里，在拉萨却出现了骚乱。透过这种奇特的现象，我们看到了两种国外力量在活动。
    这两种国外力量主要是流亡在国外的西藏分裂主义分子；其次是支持他们的一些外国政治势力和少数以维护人权为名的外国组织和个人。
    这些人，由于各自的动机，不愿看到，或者害怕看到西藏出现安定团结、蒸蒸日上的局面。因此，当西藏各方面的工作逐步改进，西藏人民安居乐业的情景到处可见的时候，当许多国家的政府在同中国进一步发展关系的时候，当国际的形势从紧张走向缓和、从对抗走向对话的时候，这些人便坐立不安，感到形势对他们越来越不利，迫不及待地施展各种手段，在西藏策划骚乱，企图达到他们不光采的目的。
    请看：
    中国政府对达赖喇嘛的方针政策很明确：爱国一家，爱国不分先后，既往不咎，在不应有任何有损祖国统一和民族团结的言行的前提下，保证来去自由。中国政府同达赖谈判的渠道始终是畅通的，除“西藏独立”问题不能商谈外，其他问题都可以谈。但是，流亡在国外的西藏分裂主义分子把中央的宽宏政策当作软弱。他们一方面加紧去一些国家进行混淆视听的游说和笼络活动。另方面利用中央对国外藏胞来去自由的政策，加紧在西藏内部煽动骚乱，企图蒙骗群众，向中央施加压力，并吸引一些外国势力对他们的注意和支持，使西藏问题国际化。
    在极少数的国家里，有一些政治势力惯于支持其他国家中不受广大人民欢迎的那种政治力量。他们借此或明或暗地干涉别国内政，对别国施加政治压力。他们鼓励西藏分裂主义分子去搞政治性的、不利于中国统一、民族团结的活动，并通过什么关心“西藏人权”的决议。由此，人们自然会联想到有人在去年和前年借别国的讲坛提出鼓吹“西藏独立”的所谓计划和“新建议”；联想到１９５１年我和平解放西藏前后，外国某些势力进行的破坏和阻挠活动；人们也联想到有的国家直到我解放军向大西南挺进时，仍对我国西藏怀有的领土野心，炮制中国中央政府对西藏只有“宗主权”等谬论。人们也记得，１９５９年３月，西藏上层分裂主义分子发动的武装叛乱，也是在某些外国势力策划和指挥下进行的。近年来，这些外国势力觉得公开提出支持“西藏独立”太露骨，便往往以关心“西藏的人权状况”作为他们的护身符。最近他们活动颇多。如在议会通过决议方式，完全歪曲西藏的情况，公然插手我内部事务。他们还向本国政府施加影响和压力，要政府出面来干涉中国内部事务。
    西方还有极少数搞人权活动的组织和个人，成为在国外的西藏分裂主义分子的重要笼络对象。他们自觉或不自觉地为后者分裂祖国的行径撑腰；借旅游者等的名义进入西藏，进行各种各样的损害该地区安定团结的活动。他们通过新闻媒介和出版书刊歪曲事实真相；在一些国际人权会议期间散布什么“西藏人权问题严重”，“西藏与中国从来就是两码事”之类的滥言。
    西藏从１３世纪以来就是中国的一部分。这是无数的藏、汉历史文物证明了的。但他们却偏不承认，编造了一套适合他们分裂中国阴谋的“西藏历史”。
    １９５１年我和平解放西藏完全是我国内部事务。他们却诬称是“侵略”。
    １９５９年西藏反动上层集团为了永远保存封建农奴制度，在外国势力策动下，发动了武装叛乱。他们却声称这是“人民起义”。
    除了对上面三个基本事实颠倒黑白之外，他们还一再散布不少违反常识的奇谈怪论，例如：
    西藏在１９５３年全国第一次人口普查中总人口是１００万，加上１９５６年划归西藏管辖的昌都地区也不过１２７万多人。现在西藏人口增至２０７万，他们却捏造西藏解放后有１００多万人被杀。
    在西藏，汉人只占３．６２％（１９８６年统计），大部分是去帮助经济建设的。国家对西藏的财政拨款１９５２—１９８８年就有１５９．７亿元，从未在财政上向西藏取过一分钱。他们却杜撰了一个什么“大西藏”，说那里已变成汉人的殖民地。
    他们不愿意正视１９５１年５月２３日中央人民政府和西藏地方政府关于和平解放西藏办法的协议和１９５１年１０月２４日达赖喇嘛表示拥护该协议致毛泽东主席的电文。在该电文中，达赖说，“西藏地方政府及藏族僧、俗人民一致拥护”这个“双方代表在友好基础上签订的协议”，“并在毛主席及中央人民政府领导下，积极协助人民解放军进藏部队，巩固国防，驱逐帝国主义势力出西藏，保护祖国领土主权的统一。”很明显，这些重要文件对他们鼓噪“西藏独立”非常不利。
    西藏民主改革前，广大农奴和奴隶过着非人的生活，人身安全根本没有保障。但那些口口声声“关心”现在西藏人权的先生们却不愿触及过去西藏毫无人权可言的事实。这又说明什么？
    “文革”中西藏的许多寺庙曾遭到严重破坏。西藏人民的感情受到伤害，这是事实。但这种破坏是全国性的，是中国政府与全国人民都感到痛心的。近些年来，遭受破坏的主要寺庙已经或正在修复。国外上述的那些政治势力对我们大力纠正的措施只一笔带过，或不愿提及，这又是为什么？
    这些人把在拉萨搞打砸抢烧、开枪打死打伤居民和武警的触犯刑律者说成是受害者，而把我治安人员在忍无可忍的情况下为保护人民安全与财产所采取的必要措施，把我国政府为维护法律和秩序而采取的正当措施，说成是违反人权。这是什么逻辑？这又是根据哪条国际公法？
    至于国外分裂主义的势力派人入境策划并制造骚乱，以及携带武器偷越国境，那就更加说明拉萨今年３月上旬的骚乱是由他们一手挑起的。
    这几年已有几万外国人去过西藏。他们中间绝大多数都认为西藏的发展变化和进步是大的。只要不带偏见，就会看到中央和西藏自治区政府为西藏人民办了许多实事，并且在继续努力。
    几个月前，一位西方的高级外交官说，他去西藏呆了三个星期，跑了不少地方。他看到西藏是平静的，西藏人民生活安定，虔诚信教，他们对搞政治不感兴趣，根本没有什么要独立之类的想法。西藏搞分裂主义的历来只是几个主要寺院的极少数人，他们过去是享有特权的。
    西藏需要的是改革开放，发展经济和教育，改善人民的生活，进一步落实中央对西藏的一系列政策。西藏各方面的工作肯定会有不足之处、缺点或失误。国外的人如果真正关心西藏的现在和未来，应当是同全体中国人民，包括西藏人民一样，希望西藏有一个有利于建设和发展的安定团结的环境。如果煽动什么“西藏独立”，或假借关心人权的名义唆使少数分裂主义分子采取暴力行为，干涉我国内政，那是逆历史潮流而动，其结果是不会体面的。
