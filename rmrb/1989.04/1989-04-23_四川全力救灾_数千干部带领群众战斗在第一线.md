　　四川全力救灾    
    数千干部带领群众战斗在第一线
    新华社成都４月２３日电（记者刘前刚）四川省泸州、自贡、隆昌、永川、井研、富顺等市县，自４月１９日２３时至２０日４时左右发生特大风雹灾害后，受到四川省委、省政府的极大关怀，灾区党政机关的数千干部正日夜带领群众救灾。
    这一带遭受风雹灾害后，四川省政府２０日上午召开紧急会议，研究救灾措施。省委、省政府派出以副省长韩邦彦为团长、省委秘书长许世群等为副团长的慰问团，兼程出发，于２１日凌晨１时抵达重灾区泸州，连夜听取灾情的汇报，并同当地领导一起部署救灾工作。泸州市领导机关组成了救灾指挥部，市级领导人和各部门干部分赴灾区，将群众急需的部分资金、油毛毡和煤油等物资送到抗灾第一线；灾区的基层干部、共产党员、共青团员站在救灾最前列，帮助房屋倒塌的灾民建棚遮雨、安排好群众的食宿和生活。
    一方受灾，八方支援。远在北京的中联公司总经理陈昌建、北京市宣武区、辽宁省抚顺市都给灾区捐款支援。
