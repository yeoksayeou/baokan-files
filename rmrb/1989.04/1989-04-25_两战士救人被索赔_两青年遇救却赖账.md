Two soldiers who rescued injured individuals were sued for compensation. Two youths, after being rescued, refused to pay their medical bills.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Jinan (correspondent Wang Honglin, reporter Jiang Yongwu), two individuals who were injured in a traffic accident and rescued by soldiers fled the hospital without paying their bills. The hospital then demanded payment from the soldiers, leading to a peculiar economic dispute.

On December 20th of last year, soldiers Wu Changjun and Bu Zengxiang from the Fifth Company of a certain unit in Luzhong were on their way when they saw two youths who had fallen into a deep ditch while riding a motorcycle. The youths were bleeding from their ears and noses and were unconscious. Despite stopping over 20 passing vehicles, none of the drivers were willing to help. The soldiers then asked local farmers to watch over the motorcycle and carried the injured youths to the nearest hospital in Jingzhi Town on foot. After the youths were treated and sent to the ward for observation, the soldiers returned to the accident site and pushed the motorcycle back to their unit for safekeeping. The next day, the two rescued youths came to the unit and took back their motorcycle.

Unexpectedly, a month later, Jingzhi Town Hospital sent someone to the Fifth Company to find soldiers Wu Changjun and Bu Zengxiang, stating that the two youths had fled without paying their bills. The soldiers provided the hospital with the names and units of the injured youths, but the hospital's attempts to track them down were unsuccessful. Since then, the hospital has repeatedly sent people to the barracks to demand 200 yuan in rescue and hospitalization fees from the two soldiers. These two soldiers, who had only been in the army for a year, were unable to pay the amount and felt very troubled. The Communist Youth League members of Shandong Province's Mengyin County Cotton Mill heard about this and sent 200 yuan, helping the two respectable soldiers out of their difficulty.

Soldiers Wu Changjun and Bu Zengxiang remarked, "Although some people lack morality, the majority still have a sense of justice. In the future, we should still do good deeds and do more of them."

　　两战士救人被索赔  两青年遇救却赖账
    据新华社济南讯（通讯员王宏林、记者蒋永武）两名出车祸被解放军战士抢救的伤员，住院脱险后溜之大吉；医院里找战士索要住院费用，引起一场特殊的经济纠纷。
    去年１２月２０日，驻鲁中某团五连战士吴长军、卜增祥外出途中，见两个骑摩托车的青年摔倒在路旁的深沟里，耳鼻出血，昏迷不醒。他们在接连拦了２０多辆过路汽车，司机都不肯帮忙的情况下，嘱托当地农民看守摩托车，各背一名受伤青年步行到附近的景芝镇医院。两青年经抢救脱险被送入病房住院观察后，他俩又返回出事地点，把摩托车推回连队代为保管。第二天，两个经抢救脱险的青年来部队推走了摩托车。
    没想到，一个月后，景芝镇医院派人到五连找战士吴长军和卜增祥，说两个青年脱险后没结账就跑了。两战士向医院提供了受伤青年留下的姓名、单位，医院追踪索账，结果“查无此人”。从此，医院一再派人到营房，找二战士索要２００元抢救住院费用。这两位入伍只一年的新兵，无力偿付这笔钱，感到十分苦恼。山东省蒙阴县棉纺厂共青团员们闻讯后，寄来了他们捐助的２００元钱，为两位可敬的战士解了难。
    战士吴长军、卜增祥感慨地说，虽然有些人不讲道德，但大多数人还是富有正义感的。今后好事还应再做，多做。
