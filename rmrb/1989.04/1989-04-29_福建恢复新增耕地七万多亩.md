This year, Fujian Province has implemented effective measures to clear abandoned land and reclaim illegally occupied arable land. As a result, the province has restored and added 75,000 acres of cultivated land.

At the beginning of this year, the Fujian Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government formulated a series of specific measures to clear abandoned land and reclaim illegally occupied arable land. During the clearance process, local authorities have used legal means to strengthen the management of arable land. At the same time, they have adopted policies such as financial subsidies, rewarding agricultural production materials, and exempting newly cultivated land from agricultural taxes and contract grain purchases for a certain period. These measures have encouraged farmers to develop arable land in a planned manner, promoting the smooth progress of this work.

　　福建恢复新增耕地七万多亩
    新华社福州４月２９日电（通讯员董帝伟）今年以来，福建省各地采取得力措施清理抛荒地和乱占耕地，全省已恢复和新增耕地７．５万亩。
    今年年初，福建省委、省政府制定了一系列清理抛荒地和乱占耕地的具体措施。各地在清理中，一面运用法律的手段进一步强化耕地管理，一面采取资金补贴，奖售农业生产资料和对新开的地一定时期内实行免交农业税、合同定购粮等优惠政策，鼓励农民有计划地开发耕地，促进了这一工作顺利进行。
