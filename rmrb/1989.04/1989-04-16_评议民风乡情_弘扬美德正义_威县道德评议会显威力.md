The People's Daily reports that in recent years, the farmers' self-governance organization "Society Moral Review Committee" has emerged in Hebei Province's Wei County. With its novel organizational form and practical activities, it has shown its power in the construction of rural spiritual civilization.

The "Society Moral Review Committee" first appeared in Liuhebei Village, Baiguoshu Township, Wei County. Subsequently, almost all townships in the county established similar committees. The members of the "Review Committee" are elected by the villagers, usually consisting of about 10 individuals who are known for their fairness, high prestige, and include old party members, old cadres, elders, and local scholars. The main task of the committee is to review local customs and morals, using public opinion to promote socialist morality, criticize and suppress various immoral behaviors, and improve social ethics.

The "Review Committee" often starts with small, specific issues and discusses them rationally. For example, the committee in Nan Zhangtai Village addressed the issue of a major road outside the village being narrowed by farmers on both sides into a narrow path. Those who had encroached on the road could not sit still, and the road was quickly repaired. Both sides of the road were also planted with poplar trees.

The "Review Committee" integrates moral reviews with cultural entertainment. In Liuhebei Village, the committee fully utilized the local custom of composing and reciting folk songs and nursery rhymes to subtly address uncivilized behaviors in the village. For instance, they composed a song: "A young couple lives in a new house, with a stove, TV, and a double bed; an old couple lives in an old house, with a kang bed, thin quilt, and a leaky wall." After hearing these reviews, six young couples moved their elderly parents into new houses, five households that had not heated their elderly parents' rooms started doing so, and seven households that had not bought winter clothes for their elderly parents bought them fur coats.

　　评议民风乡情　弘扬美德正义
　　威县道德评议会显威力
    本报讯　河北省威县近年涌现的农民自治组织“社会道德评议会”，以其新颖的组织形式和实在的活动内容，在农村精神文明建设中显威力。
    “社会道德评议会”最先产生于威县白果树乡刘河北寨村，此后全县绝大多数乡也纷纷建立。“评议会”成员由村民推举１０名左右办事公道、威信较高的老党员、老干部、长辈、土秀才组成。主要评议民风乡情，借助舆论的力量弘扬社会主义道德，抨击和抑制各种不道德的行为，促进社会风气好转。
    “评议会”往往从小事、具体事入手，就事论理。该县南章台村的评议会，抓住村外一条大路被两边种地的农户“啃”成羊肠小道一事进行评论，侵占道路的人坐不住了，路很快得到修复，道两旁还栽种了毛白杨。
    “评议会”寓评于文化娱乐。刘河北寨村的评议会充分利用本村群众喜爱编念顺口溜、儿歌的习惯，针对村里的不文明现象编歌谣“旁敲侧击”。如：“小两口住新房，火炉电视双人床；老两口住旧房，土炕薄被透风墙”等。风闻这些“评议”后，有６对青年夫妇把老人从旧房搬进新房，５户原来没给老人屋里生火炉的生了火炉，还有７户原先没给老人置棉衣的人家给老人买了皮袄。
