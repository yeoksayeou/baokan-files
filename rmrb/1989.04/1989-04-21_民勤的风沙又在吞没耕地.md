Our ancestors have been fighting against the sandstorms for generations. After liberation, we started planting white wax trees on the sand dunes. After many years of hard work, we have basically controlled the movement of the sand dunes, turning the desert into an oasis. We reclaimed the land and planted wheat, and we have been able to survive here.

In the past two years, many people have been collecting white wax fruits to sell to wild fruit beverage factories. During the collection process, many branches and stems of the white wax trees have been damaged, and new seedlings cannot grow. As a result, the sand dunes cannot be fixed, and the sandstorms have swallowed part of the farmland again. If this continues, large areas of farmland will be swallowed by the desert.

We appeal to leaders at all levels to take measures to protect our habitat—the desert oasis.

专栏：

　　民勤的风沙又在吞没耕地
    我们祖祖辈辈一年四季与风沙搏斗。解放后，我们开始在沙丘上种植白蜡树，经过多年的艰苦奋斗，基本上控制了沙丘的移动，沙漠成了绿洲。我们开垦了土地，种植了小麦，在这里生存下来。
    近两年来，许多人采集白蜡果，卖给野果食品厂制做饮料用。由于采集时白蜡树枝杆损坏不少，新苗长不出来。这样，沙丘无法固定，风沙又吞没了部分耕地。如果这样下去，大片的耕地将被沙漠吞没。
    呼吁各级领导同志采取措施，保护我们的栖息地——沙漠绿洲。
