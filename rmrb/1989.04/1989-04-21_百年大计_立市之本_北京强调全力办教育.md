	Education is the Foundation for a City's Prosperity
	Beijing Emphasizes Full Effort in Education

	Beijing, April 21 (Xinhua) — Mayor Chen Xitong of Beijing Municipality said at the municipal people's congress that every possible measure should be taken to support education, to remove difficulties and open up a new situation for the capital's educational cause.

	The municipal government has decided to spare no effort to raise funds and materials for education. Last year, the investment in education accounted for 18.1 percent of the municipal budget, and this year it will be raised to 20 percent on that basis. Enterprises, public institutions, and all sectors of society are encouraged to donate funds for education or raise funds to establish people's educational funds. Further support and assistance will be given to school-run enterprises to raise funds for education through multiple channels. This year, the municipal government has decided to raise 50 million yuan to implement the structural reform of teachers' salaries in primary and secondary schools, so that the average income of teachers and staff in the whole city can reach the average income level of employees in state-owned enterprises. Under the condition of significantly reducing the scale of construction investment, the task of building teachers' housing will not be reduced, but will be completed on schedule. All dilapidated school buildings will be renovated this year, and it will be ensured that primary schools will not adopt the double-shift system.

	The municipal government also emphasizes in its measures that moral education should be placed in a prominent position in school work, and the whole society should be mobilized to support education. Factories, rural areas, neighborhoods, shops, and the military should provide teaching and practice sites and conditions for students.

　　百年大计　立市之本    
    北京强调全力办教育
    本报北京４月２１日讯  记者颜世贵报道：北京市长陈希同在此间举行的市人代会上提出：要提供一切可能提供的条件为教育排忧解难，开创首都教育事业新局面。
    市政府决定千方百计多挤一些资金和物资办教育。去年教育投资占市财政预算内支出１８．１％，今年要在此基础上达到２０％。鼓励企事业单位和社会各界捐资助学或集资办学，建立人民教育基金。进一步扶植和支持校办企业，多渠道筹措教育资金。今年，市里已拍板筹集５０００万元，用于中小学结构工资改革，使全市中小学教职工的平均收入达到全民所有制职工的平均收入水平。在大幅度压缩基建投资规模的情况下，教职工住宅建设任务不仅不压，而且要按时完成。学校危房今年要全部加以解决，同时保证小学不出现二部制。
    市政府在采取的措施中，还强调把德育放在学校工作的首要位置，动员全社会来支持教育。厂矿、农村、街道、商店、部队要为学生提供教学实习、社会实践的场所和条件。
