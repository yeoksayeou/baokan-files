	The Seventh National People's Congress Second Session Small Group Speeches Excerpts

	Shanxi delegate Hai Yumei said:

	Increasing transparency in appointing officials
	There should be increased transparency in appointing officials and listening to public opinions. Those officials who deceive superiors and subordinates, abuse power for personal gain, and engage in corruption should be firmly dealt with. Many people say that the relationship between officials and the masses used to be like "fish and water," but now it's like "oil and water." Now that the authority of the government is emphasized, if officials are not clean, the government's authority cannot be established.

	Hong Kong delegate Zheng Yaotang said:

	Hong Kong compatriots are concerned about corruption issues
	Hong Kong compatriots are extremely concerned about the issue of corruption among mainland officials. This issue directly affects people's image and confidence in the motherland. In recent years, there have been serious cases of corruption and dereliction of duty in government agencies, especially among high-ranking officials who use their positions to seek personal gain. Some officials, in order to arrange for their children's future, do not hesitate to harm the interests of the people. When the people expose their misdeeds, they retaliate. This has reached an intolerable level. Hong Kong people say, "Nothing can be done without money on the mainland," "Money can do anything." If the issue of corruption is not addressed and allowed to spread, it will inevitably weaken the government's credibility, and the consequences will be even worse than severe inflation.

	PLA delegate Hong Jiade said:

	Protecting the legal rights of soldiers
	Currently, there are increasing incidents of disrupting military duties, damaging military facilities, and occupying military camp land. All levels of government should pay serious attention to national defense education for the entire population. When handling military-civilian disputes, do not solely demand that the military take a "high posture." Emphasize the use of legal means to handle military-civilian disputes and infringements. Those who harm the legal rights of soldiers should be given appropriate punishment. Additionally, based on the new situations in military-civilian relations, relevant regulations on protecting military facilities should be supplemented and improved in a timely manner.

	Hebei delegate Shen Licheng said:

	Stabilizing and consolidating township enterprises
	I firmly support the central government's policy of rectification and adjustment, but I have a concern: will township enterprises experience a decline during this period? In Hebei Province, especially in mountainous and old revolutionary base areas, township enterprises started late and developed slowly. Now that they are just gaining momentum and seeing some benefits, they encounter rectification and adjustment, and tightening of credit. I am worried about the fate of township enterprises. If township enterprises shrink, it will inevitably lead to a large influx of rural labor into cities, impacting urban transportation, affecting urban stability, and putting pressure on urban employment, housing, and food supply. It will also make family planning work in cities more difficult. Years of practice have proven that developing township enterprises is crucial for farmers to get rid of poverty and become prosperous, and for the development of education, health, welfare, and insurance in rural areas. I hope that all levels of government will care for and support township enterprises, so that they can be consolidated and developed during the rectification and adjustment period.

	Shaanxi delegate Zhou Yaguang said:

	Seriously address social order and social ethics
	Currently, there are many problems in social order and social ethics. The trends of theft, robbery, gambling, prostitution, drug abuse, and superstition are very strong, affecting reforms and disturbing public sentiment. The main reasons are: first, ideological and political work has been relaxed for a long time. Everything is solved by giving money, and by "paid services." In fact, this is not possible. It is still necessary to rely on political advantages and strengthen ideological education to improve people's political quality. Second, grassroots organizations are scattered. They are eager to establish this company and that company, but no one cares about grassroots work. The often-mentioned comprehensive management, who will take charge? If the party branches, youth leagues, and trade unions do not take charge, can the public security, courts, and procuratorates handle it? Third, spiritual civilization construction is poorly implemented.

	Youth delegate Liu Yandong said:

	Optimize the social environment for the growth of young people
	The total number of young people in our country is about 500 million, accounting for 45% of the national population. The average age of the population in our country is 26 years old, making it one of the youngest countries in the world. The ideals, beliefs, moral cultivation, knowledge level, labor skills, and value orientation of the young generation determine the present and future of our country and nation. Currently, optimizing the social environment for the growth of young people has become a very urgent issue. I suggest: first, optimize the ideological and cultural environment for the growth of young people; second, actively formulate national youth policies; third, quickly formulate and promulgate the "Law on the Protection of Minors," and use legal means to protect the healthy growth of young people.

	Shanxi delegate Kang Longtian said:

	Coal production areas should be directly linked with consumption areas
	The current situation in the coal industry is good, but there are also problems: those who mine coal are not as profitable as those who transport coal, those who transport coal are not as profitable as those who sell coal, and those who sell coal are not as profitable as those who speculate in coal. I hope the state will take measures to directly link production areas with consumption areas, reduce intermediate links, appropriately increase coal prices, and give Shanxi some autonomy and export rights.

	Ningxia delegates Li Tianzhu, Ma Zhuo, and Hui Lianjie said:

	Ethnic education work needs to be strengthened
	Currently, the proportion of Hui officials in Ningxia is decreasing. To fundamentally change this passive situation, the key is to strengthen ethnic education work. Currently, minority students only account for 26% of the total number of students in the region, which is not in line with the natural population ratio and is not conducive to the cultivation of the reserve cadre team of the Hui people. Although the autonomous region government attaches great importance to ethnic education work, educational funds are seriously insufficient. I hope that the relevant departments of the central government can give necessary consideration in terms of educational funds.

### 全国人大七届二次会议小组发言摘编

　　全国人大七届二次会议小组发言摘编
    山西代表海玉美说：
    任命干部要增加透明度
    任命干部要增加透明度，听取群众意见。要坚决整治那些欺上瞒下、以权谋私、贪污受贿的不合格干部。好多群众说：过去的干群关系是“鱼水”关系，现在是“油水”关系。现在强调政府的权威，如果干部不廉洁，政府就树不起权威。
    香港代表郑耀棠说：
    香港同胞关注廉政问题
    香港同胞对国内干部廉洁问题极为关注，这件事直接影响到人们对祖国的形象和信心。近年来，政府机关干部贪污渎职的情况严重，尤其是有的高级干部利用职权谋取私利，有的为了安排子女出路，不惜损害群众利益，当群众揭发其丑行时，竟然打击报复，已到了不能容忍的地步。香港人说“大陆是无财不行”、“有财可通神”。如果不抓廉政问题，放任贪污腐败现象蔓延，势必削弱政府威信，其后果比恶性通货膨胀还要厉害。
    解放军代表洪家德说：
    要保护军人合法权益
    现在，干扰军务执勤、破坏军事设施、占用营区土地等案件增多。各级政府要切实重视全民国防教育。在处理军民纠纷时，不要片面要求部队“高姿态”。要强调运用法律手段处理军民纠纷和侵权行为，对损害军人合法权益的不法分子，应给予应有的惩处。再次，根据军民关系上出现的新情况，要及时补充和完善有关保护军事设施等条例。
    河北代表申礼成说：
    要稳定和巩固乡镇企业
    坚决拥护中央治理整顿方针，但是我有一个担心，就是在治理整顿中乡镇企业会不会出现滑坡。河北省，特别是山区、老区乡镇企业上得晚，上得慢，现在劲头刚起来，甜头刚尝到，就碰到治理整顿，抽紧银根，我很为乡镇企业的命运担忧。如果乡镇企业萎缩，势必造成农村劳动力大量涌入城市，从而冲击城市交通，影响城市安定，给城市的就业、住房、副食品供应带来压力，给城市的计划生育工作造成困难。几年的实践证明，发展乡镇企业对农民的脱贫致富，对农村的教育、卫生、福利和保险事业的发展都有重大作用。希望各级政府关心、支持乡镇企业，使其在治理整顿中得到巩固和发展。
    陕西代表周雅光说：
    要认真抓社会治安和社会风气
    目前社会治安和社会风气方面存在不少问题，盗窃、抢劫、赌博、卖淫、吸毒、迷信的势头很猛，影响改革，扰乱民心。主要原因，一是长期以来思想政治工作有所放松。什么事情都靠发钱解决问题，靠“有偿服务”做工作。事实上是不可能的，还是要靠发挥政治优势，靠加强思想教育，提高人的政治素质。二是基层组织涣散。热衷于成立这公司、那公司，基层工作却没人过问，经常讲的综合治理，靠谁来抓，党支部、团支部、工会组织不抓，只靠公安、法院、检察院能治得了吗？三是精神文明建设落实很差。
    青年代表刘延东说：
    优化青少年成长的社会环境
    我国青少年总数约为５亿，占全国人口４５％，我国人口平均年龄为２６岁，是世界上人口最年轻的国家之一。青少年一代的理想信念、道德修养、知识水平、劳动技能和价值取向如何，决定着我们国家和民族的现在和未来。当前，优化青少年成长的社会环境，已成为一个十分紧迫的问题。我建议：一、优化青少年成长的思想文化环境；二、积极抓紧制定国家青年政策；三、尽快制定颁布《未成年人保护法》，运用法律手段保护青少年健康成长。
    山西代表亢龙田说：
    煤炭产地与用地应直接挂钩
    现在煤炭战线的形势是好的，但也有问题：挖煤的不如运煤的，运煤的不如卖煤的，卖煤的不如倒煤的。希望国家采取措施，使产地与用地直接挂钩，减少中间环节，适当提高煤价，给山西一些自主权和出口权。
    宁夏代表李天柱、马钊、惠连杰说：
    民族教育工作要大力加强
    目前宁夏的回族干部所占的比例呈下降的趋势。根本改变这种被动局面，关键是要加强民族教育工作。当前少数民族学生只占全区学生总数的２６％，和人口自然比例不相适应，不利于回族后备干部队伍的培养。自治区政府虽然十分重视民族教育工作，但教育经费严重不足。希望中央有关部门能在教育经费方面再适当地给予必要的照顾。
