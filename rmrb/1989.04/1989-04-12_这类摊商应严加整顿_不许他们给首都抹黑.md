	These Street Vendors Must Be Strictly Rectified - Do Not Allow Them to Tarnish the Capital
		Reporters: Jiang Di, Cui Yuewen, Li Jinhong

	On March 29, two female colleagues from Shanghai Electric Meter Factory Four, who were in Beijing on business, reported to the People's Daily's Mass Work Department that they bought two melons, weighing approximately 1 kilogram, from a melon stall near the 332 bus stop at the Beijing Zoo. The vendor charged 23 yuan. They indignantly said, "Isn't this 'ripping off' outsiders?!"

	On the afternoon of March 30, reporters went to the scene to observe. Here, there are more than 80 stalls made of plastic boards and aluminum alloy doors. In front of the stalls is the terminal stop for bus route 102, and to the right is the terminal stop for bus route 103. Tourists heading to places like the Summer Palace, Fragrant Hills, and the Eight Great Sites need to transfer buses here. There are many bus stops, and there are many hurried tourists passing through.

	"Eat melons, eat melons, 20 cents!" How much melon can 20 cents buy? The vendor deliberately does not say. Thirsty outsiders have not yet asked in detail, and the melon is already in their hands. Once the customer takes a bite, the melon seller presses the calculator and says, "20 cents for 25 grams (half a market unit), this melon is 1800 grams, 14.4 yuan." The customer feels cheated and inevitably wants to argue, but at best, they are ridiculed, insulted, and pushed by the melon seller, and at worst, they may suffer physical harm. The reporter stood there for about an hour, and such incidents occurred more than 10 times.

	Most of the melon sellers here are hired helpers. They wear white shirts and have name tags (see the picture above). As soon as they see outsiders, they proactively approach and chat, repeatedly calling, "Grandpa, Grandma, eat a melon, it's cheap!" They hand over the already weighed melon to the customer, saying, "No rush to pay, you eat first, pay after you eat!" An elderly woman from Hebei's Xijin County bought a melon less than 500 grams for her grandson. The child took a bite, and the melon seller said, "1100 grams, 11.8 yuan!" The grandmother was surprised and asked, "How can one melon cost more than 11 yuan?" At this point, the melon seller changed his face, "What's the matter? If you can eat, pay up, if you can't, get out!" Amidst the chaos, someone chimed in, "Come on, don't argue with them, losing money and being cheated is just once, forget it, don't provoke them." After driving away the elderly woman, the melon seller and the bystander laughed together. This happened at stall number 64.

	At stall number 40, a female vendor with permed hair chased a soldier to the middle of the road, pushing and cursing, "Are you leaving or not, if you don't leave, I'll beat you!" (see the picture below left) Another tall and thin young man pointed at the soldier's nose and threatened, "If you want your money back, I'll tear off your badge, believe it or not?" Later, the reporter learned that the soldier bought a melon for his father. The melon seller charged 13 yuan, the old man thought it was too expensive, and let his son return the melon and get the money back. The vendor refused to return the money, saying they never received any, leading to an argument.

	At 2:40 PM, a joint inspection team consisting of public security, industrial and commercial administration, and other four departments suddenly appeared. The vendors in this area immediately became flustered. Some wiped tables and swept the floor, while one vendor reminded the neighboring vendors, "Change the scales, change the scales, quickly change the scales!" By the time the inspection team arrived, more than 80% of the stalls had closed their aluminum alloy doors and avoided the inspection. The vendors also hid. Once the inspection team left, the vendors resumed their old tricks.

	On the same day, the price of melons at individual stalls in Chaoyang District's Xiaozhuang was 1.4 yuan per 500 grams, while here it was 4 yuan per 500 grams. In these stalls, there is a widespread practice of reporting incorrect weights and arbitrary pricing. Engineer Hu Huali from Shanghai Electric Meter Factory reported that on March 29, the two melons she bought weighed only over 1000 grams, but the vendor at stall number 57 insisted they weighed 2900 grams. On March 30, the reporter saw several young people from Anhui's Ma'anshan Steel Company arguing with the melon seller for overcharging, asking, "Is there no law in Beijing?" (see the picture below right) The melon seller patted his chest and said, "I am the law!"

	The reporter's photography attracted the attention of some vendors, and some came to cause trouble. A man in his 30s stood in front of the reporter and spoke obscenely; another man in a black suit, who was thin and dark, used a metal toy gun to knock on the reporter's camera, cursing obscenely, while some melon sellers gathered around the reporter to cause trouble.

	Since last year, many outsiders have written to the newspaper reporting that the situation of vendors cheating tourists in this area is serious. The newspaper published a reader's letter titled "Warning to Customers: Beware of Fraudulent Tricks, Warning to Vendors: Do Not Engage in Cheating" and photos on the fifth page on June 4, 1988, but the situation has not improved. The reporter interviewed the management office of the food market in the Xicheng District's Beijing Zoo area. The relevant responsible person said that these vendors are not ordinary people, and their licenses cannot be revoked. To manage this market, we have changed five directors in four years.

	Now that spring has arrived and it is the tourist season in Beijing, readers have reported more letters about some vendors cheating customers in this area. They hope that the Beijing Municipal Government will make a decision to clean up and rectify this market, severely punish these lawless vendors who tarnish the capital, and publish the results of the investigation to the public.

### 这类摊商应严加整顿  不许他们给首都抹黑

    这类摊商应严加整顿
　  不许他们给首都抹黑
　　本报记者　蒋铎　崔悦温　李晋鸿
    3月29日，上海电表四厂来北京出差的两位女同志向本报群众工作部反映，她们在北京动物园332路车站对面的瓜摊买了两块哈密瓜，约重1公斤，摊贩竟要23元。她们气愤地说：“这不是‘宰’外地人吗？！”
    3月30日下午，记者来到现场观察，这里一个挨一个的塑料制板、铝合金拉门的摊位有80多间，摊前是102路电车的终点站，右边是103路电车的终点站，前往颐和园、香山、八大处等旅游点的游人需在此处换车。这里车站多，匆匆过往的游客也多。
    “吃瓜啦，吃瓜啦，两毛钱！”两毛钱能买多少瓜呢？叫卖者故意不说。口渴难忍的外地人还没细问，瓜已送到手上。等顾客咬上一口，卖瓜人便按一按手中的计算器叫道：“两毛钱25克（半市两），这块瓜1800克，14块4毛。”顾客感到上当，难免要论个理，但轻则遭到卖瓜人的奚落、辱骂、推搡，重则免不了要受皮肉之苦。记者在那里站了1小时左右，这样的事就发生了10多起。
    这里守摊卖瓜的大多是摊主雇用的帮工。他们穿着白上衣，胸前挂着牌子（见上图），见到外地游客便主动上前搭话，口口声声叫着：“大爷、大娘，吃块瓜吧，便宜！”边说边把已称好的瓜送到顾客手上，嘴里还说：“不忙给钱，您先吃，吃完再算！”一位来自河北冀县的老大娘给孙子买了一块不到500克的哈密瓜，孩子刚咬了一口，卖瓜的人叫道：“1100克，11块8毛！”大娘惊奇地问：“一块瓜怎么要11块多钱？”这时，卖瓜人翻脸了，“怎么着？吃得起掏钱，吃不起滚蛋！”混乱中，帮腔的出场了：“得了，别跟他们怄气，吃亏上当只一回，算了，别惹他们。”哄走了老大娘，卖瓜的、帮腔的笑成一团。这是64号摊位发生的事。
    40号瓜摊上，烫着卷发的女摊主将一位解放军战士赶到马路中间，边赶边骂：“你走不走，再不走我打你！”（见下图左）另一个瘦高个子男青年指着这位战士的鼻子扬言：“你再要钱，我揪掉你的领章，你信不信？”事后，记者经了解才知道，这位战士给父亲买了块瓜，卖瓜的要价13元，老人嫌贵，让儿子退瓜要回瓜钱，摊主赖账说根本没有给钱，于是发生了争吵。
    下午2点40分，由公安、工商等4个部门组成的检查队突然出现，这一地区的摊贩们立刻手忙脚乱。有的抹桌子扫地，一个摊主提醒相邻的摊商：“换秤，换秤，快把秤换了！”待检查人员来到时，80％以上的摊位已拉下铝合金门，回避检查，摊主们也躲起来了。检查人员一走，商贩们又故伎重演。
    同一天，朝阳区小庄个体瓜摊哈密瓜的价格是每500克1.4元，而这里每500克竟卖4元。在这些摊点中，普遍存在乱报份量、随意报价的现象。上海电表四厂工程师胡华丽反映说，3月29日，她买的两块瓜不过1000多克，但57号摊主却硬说2900克。30日，记者在现场见到安徽马鞍山钢铁公司几个年轻人为摊主多报斤两气愤地质问卖瓜人：“北京还有没有王法？”（见下图右）卖瓜的拍着胸脯说：“老子就是法！”
    记者的拍照引起了个别摊贩的注意，有的人装疯卖傻地过来捣乱。一个30岁左右的男人走到记者面前说着下流话；还有一个穿黑西服、又黑又瘦的男人手拿一支金属玩具手枪敲打着记者的照相机，嘴里不干不净地骂着，一些卖瓜人围着记者起哄。
    从去年以来，不少外地来京者写信向本报反映，这个地区的瓜摊坑骗游人的情况严重。对此，本报去年6月4日第五版曾刊登读者来信《敬告顾客：提防骗买伎俩，正告商贩：莫干坑人勾当》和照片，但情况一直没有改变。记者曾采访了西城区动物园地区食品市场管理处，有关负责人说，这些商贩都不是一般人，吊销谁的执照都不行。为了管好这个市场，我们4年换了5个主任。
    现在春暖花开，正值北京的旅游季节，读者反映这一地区某些商贩坑骗顾客的信件也多起来了。他们希望北京市政府下决心清理整顿这个市场，严惩这些给首都抹黑的不法商贩，并把查处结果公布于众。
