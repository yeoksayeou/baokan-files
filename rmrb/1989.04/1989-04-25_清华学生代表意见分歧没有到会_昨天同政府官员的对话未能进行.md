Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 25th.

The planned dialogue between some students and government officials and relevant personnel from the All-China Students' Federation, scheduled for this afternoon at the Beijing Municipal Committee building, did not take place due to disagreements among the student representatives from Tsinghua University.

According to a responsible person from Tsinghua University, yesterday morning, some students from Tsinghua University expressed the hope to have a dialogue with leaders from the State Council. The State Council, the State Education Commission, and the Beijing Municipal Committee attached great importance to this request from the students and decided to hold a dialogue at 2:30 PM today in the second-floor conference room of the Beijing Municipal Committee building with 18 student representatives.

At 2 PM, Vice Secretary of the State Council Liu Zhongde, Deputy Minister of the State Education Commission He Dongchang, Deputy Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee Wang Jiaxuan, and relevant personnel from the All-China Students' Federation and the Beijing Municipal Students' Federation arrived at the venue on time. However, by 4:15 PM, the student representatives had still not arrived.

This responsible person told reporters that he had called the school multiple times to inquire, and the response was that the students requesting the dialogue had differing opinions on who should represent them, leading to a stalemate and an inability to send representatives. Government officials and reporters from multiple news agencies waited at the venue for more than two hours.

This responsible person expressed regret to the reporters, apologizing for the dialogue not taking place.

　　清华学生代表意见分歧没有到会    
    昨天同政府官员的对话未能进行
    新华社北京４月２５日电  原定今天下午在北京市委大楼举行的部分学生同政府官员和全国学联有关负责人的对话，由于清华大学的学生代表内部意见分歧不能派人参加而未能进行。
    据清华大学的负责人介绍，昨天上午，清华大学部分学生提出希望同国务院负责人对话。国务院、国家教委和北京市委很重视学生提出的这一要求，决定今天下午两点半在北京市委大楼二楼会议室与１８名学生代表对话。
    下午两点，国务院副秘书长刘忠德，国家教委副主任何东昌，中共北京市委副书记汪家镠，全国学联和北京市学联负责人按时来到会场，但直等到下午４时１５分，仍未见到学生代表。
    这位负责人对记者说，他曾多次打电话回学校催问，回答是：要求对话的学生由于对谁当代表意见不一，争持不下，派不出代表。政府官员和多家新闻单位的记者在会场等了两个多小时。
    这位负责人向记者说，他对此表示歉意，为对话未能实现感到遗憾。
