Editor's Note: The phenomenon of numerous enterprises in Neijiang conducting social fundraising through various means is quite noteworthy. Currently, while the supply and demand of funds are tight, there is an excess of currency in the market. Where are all these funds circulating? How are they circulating? Many people have been puzzled by this. Due to the current disorder in the financial system, many funds are actually circulating "outside" the banking system. Excessive social fundraising is just one form of this "circulation." The situation in Neijiang indicates that without a firm resolve to rectify the financial order, it will be difficult to implement the policy of tightening credit.

Currently, enterprises are facing financial difficulties, which is a fact. However, to strengthen the control and management of social fundraising, it is necessary to emphasize that no unit can issue bonds, stocks, and other financial instruments without approval. This is a matter of overall importance. To improve the rectification and adjustment, it is the only choice for China's economy to get out of the current predicament. To carry out the rectification and adjustment, we must be wholeheartedly dedicated. Being wholeheartedly dedicated means not being half-hearted or insincere. To achieve this, the most important thing is for the entire nation to be united. How can it be called "united" if one ignores the overall rectification and adjustment and only focuses on the "small picture" of a local area or a single factory?

According to a report from our newspaper, when the state implemented policies to control economic overheating and banks began to tighten credit, enterprises in Neijiang, Sichuan Province, started various forms of social fundraising, opening up "backdoor" channels for fixed asset investments. According to investigations by relevant departments, the total amount of social fundraising in the city last year exceeded 200 million yuan. Most of the fundraising units were commercial enterprises, with a few government agencies and organizations also involved. Even some county-level governments issued documents to conduct widespread fundraising within their jurisdictions without authorization.

According to the Sichuan Daily, the forms of social fundraising are diverse. Some issue stocks or bonds, some use risk mortgages for equity participation, and others bring in capital through various means. Some fundraising is limited to within the enterprise, while others are open to society. Most of these fundraising activities were not approved by the People's Bank of China. According to investigations by relevant departments, 232 enterprises raised a total of 114 million yuan, but only 12.2 million yuan, or 10.73%, were approved by the bank and brought under standardized management. The formats of bonds (or stocks) are chaotic, and the use of receipts and accounting methods for fundraising is extremely common.

Social fundraising in Neijiang has a common characteristic: high-interest rates. According to state regulations, the face value interest rate of social fundraising tickets should not exceed 40% of the bank's same-period savings deposit interest rate. However, the interest rates for social fundraising in Neijiang are generally more than twice the state's corresponding rates.

According to investigations, very little of Neijiang's social fundraising is used to supplement working capital shortages, and even less is used for technological transformation. 73.16% of the funds are used for fixed asset investments. This leads to an expansion of fixed asset investments, highlighting supply and demand contradictions, which contradicts the current rectification and adjustment policies. At the same time, due to high fundraising interest rates, enterprise costs have increased, and state fiscal revenues have been diverted. 80% of the fundraising amount is withdrawn from bank savings by the public, not only reducing the bank's credit fund sources but also hindering the adjustment of credit structures. Enterprises that should be supported by banks lack funds, while those that should be restricted continue to develop blindly through fundraising.

In reality, social fundraising often involves forced levies, increasing the burden on employees and adding to social instability. A certain glass factory last year, when the income of employees in the factory was only 1,000 yuan, forced each employee to raise 800 yuan. Many employees could not afford to pay, and there were complaints everywhere. A certain silk factory in Weiyuan County, approved by the district government, raised 20 million yuan from employees and society through receipts, far exceeding the economic capacity of the employees, causing a bad social impact.

### 不经银行批准擅自发行债券股票  内江企业社会集资过滥  大多用于固定资产投资助长经济过热

　　不经银行批准擅自发行债券股票
    内江企业社会集资过滥
    大多用于固定资产投资助长经济过热
    编者按  内江市以种种名目开展社会集资的企业这么多，集资数额这么大，是一种很值得重视的现象。当前一方面资金供求关系紧张，另一方面市场票子过多。那么多的票子都在哪里运行？怎样运行？许多人曾一度为之困惑。由于目前金融秩序混乱，许多票子实际上在银行“体外循环”，过滥的社会集资不过是其一种“循环”形式而已。内江市的情形说明，不下大决心整顿金融秩序，紧缩信贷的方针就很难贯彻下去。
    目前企业资金不足，日子不好过，这是实情。但为了加强对社会集资的控制和管理，强调任何单位未经批准不得擅自发行债券、股票等，是大局的需要。搞好治理整顿，是我国经济走出目前困境的唯一可以选择的出路。进行治理整顿必须一心一意。所谓一心一意，就是不能三心二意，更不能虚情假意。而要做到一心一意，最重要的就是全国一条心。不顾治理整顿大局，只讲一地一厂的“小局”，怎么能叫“一条心”呢？
    本报讯　当国家实行控制经济过热的政策、银行开始紧缩银根时，四川省内江市的企业却纷纷开展社会集资，使固定资产投资“旁门”大开。据有关部门调查测算，去年该市社会集资总额达２亿元以上。集资单位大多数是工商企业，也有个别机关团体。甚至还有县级政府擅自发文在辖区内广泛集资。
    据四川日报报道，这些社会集资的形式多种多样，有的发行股票或债券，有的是风险抵押入股，也有的带资入厂。有的集资局限于企业内部，有的则面向社会。这些集资绝大多数未经人民银行批准，据有关部门对２３２家企业调查，集资额达１．１４亿元，但经银行批准、纳入规范管理的只有１２２０万元，仅占１０．７３％。债券（或股票）格式混乱，以收据和记帐方式的集资极为普遍。
    内江市社会集资有一个共同特点，就是利率很高。按国家规定，社会集资票面利率不得高于银行同期储蓄定期存款利率的４０％。但内江市的社会集资一般比国家同档次利率高出两倍多。
    据调查，内江市社会集资很少用于补充流动资金的不足，用于技术改造的更是微乎其微，７３．１６％的集资用于固定资产投资。由此导致固定资产投资膨胀，供需矛盾突出，这与当前治理整顿的政策相违背。同时，由于集资利率高，加大了企业成本，转移了国家财政收入。８０％的集资额是群众从银行储蓄中支取的，不仅减少了银行信贷资金来源，而且不利于调整信贷结构。该支持的企业银行无资金支持，该限制的企业又通过集资盲目发展。
    社会集资实际上强行摊派的多，不仅加重了职工负担，也增加了社会不稳定因素。某玻璃厂去年在本厂职工收入只有１０００元的情况下，强令每个职工集资８００元，不少职工无力支付，怨声载道。威远县某丝厂经区政府批准，在本厂职工和社会上以收据方式集资２００万元，大大超过职工的经济承受能力，在社会上造成恶劣影响。
