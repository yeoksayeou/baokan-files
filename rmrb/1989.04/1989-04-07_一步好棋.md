Hubei Provincial Committee has made a good move: provincial-level officials who volunteer to move to prefectures, cities, and counties will be promoted by one rank and serve at the grassroots level. Additionally, all related relationships will be transferred, household registrations will be relocated, and the "official hat" will not be kept in "reserve."

This strategy has several advantages: it helps to address the common issue of talent accumulation in large organizations where "dragons and tigers" are hidden but have no place to show their skills. This is the first advantage. Related to this, excellent cadres will be sent to the grassroots level, which can alleviate the urgent need for talent in some places. If they perform well, they can open up the work in backward areas, which is the second advantage. Cadres bringing their relationships and families to settle in the grassroots level require a spirit of sacrifice, which is not something that old cadres who aim to be lifelong "peaceful officials" can easily do. This move shakes up the old cadre system, which is the third advantage. When cadres go to the grassroots level, if they are not elected in party and government elections, they will become ordinary citizens on the spot. This "forces" the serving cadres to perform their duties, continuously innovate, and strive for progress, which is the fourth advantage. Local residents will also be reassured by such sincere cadres who come to settle down, eliminating their "worries" and being willing to work together with them wholeheartedly, which is the fifth advantage.

Naturally, any new thing, any new plan will go through a process of continuous improvement. The practice of Hubei provincial-level officials exchanging positions with grassroots-level officials has just started, and it is not surprising that some "negative effects" may arise. Various opinions and feedback will also emerge, which is very normal. Whether it is a plan or a measure, the key lies in improvement and matching. For example, when cadres go from large organizations to the grassroots level, they will encounter various difficulties: unfamiliar work, being ostracized by some local people, family conflicts, etc. The higher-level organization should warmly care for them instead of just sending them down and not caring about them. At the same time, will there be people who go down to "gold-plate" and then find reasons to return to the city? The party committee's organizational department should be alert to this and strictly implement institutional measures.

In summary, the key to Hubei Provincial Committee's move is to see the action.

　　一步好棋
　　维伟
    湖北省委走了一步好棋：省直机关干部如自愿向地市州县流动，“官”升一“品”，在基层任职；同时规定各种关系随转，家属户口随迁，而且“乌纱帽”不入“保险”。
    此招多有妙处：有利于医治大机关人才堆积、藏“龙”卧“虎”、又无用武之地的“通病”，此为一；与此相关，优秀干部充实到基层，也能缓解某些地方求贤若渴的燃眉之急，若干得出色，还可以打开尚处落后地区工作的局面，此为二；干部本人带着各种关系、带着全家老小一同下基层安家落户，没有点牺牲精神，是没勇气走这一步的，这一招撼动了终身当“太平官”的旧干部体制，此为三；干部下基层任职，“乌纱帽”不入“保险”，如果党、政换届落选，就地当“老百姓”，这就“逼”着任职干部在其位、谋其政，不断开拓，不断进取，此为四；当地百姓对这种诚心诚意下来落户的干部，也吃了“定心丸”，解除了“后顾之忧”，愿意与他们掏心窝里的话，肝胆相照干事业，此为五。
    自然，任何新的事物，新的方案总有一个不断完善的过程，湖北省直机关干部交流到基层的做法刚刚起步，产生某些“负效应”是不足为奇的，各种舆论，各种反映一同产生，也很正常。方案也好，措施也好，关键在于完善，在于配套。比如，干部从大机关下到基层，会遇到种种困难：工作不熟悉啦，受到地方某些人排挤啦，家庭有了矛盾啦，……上级组织应热情地关心他们，而不是撒下去不管。同时，有没有人下去镀了金再找理由变相回城？党委的组织部门对此当有警觉，并切实严格制度措施。
    总之，对湖北省委走出的这一步，关键还是看行动。
