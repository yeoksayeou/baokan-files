Title: Questioning the "Discount Prices"

The business director of a certain unit went to a department store to shop. After the negotiations were completed, he heard the store's accountant say to the director, "Our manager said that although this batch of goods is in high demand, we will still sell it to you at an 80% discount of the purchase price." Bystanders were puzzled, wondering why, if the goods were in high demand, they would be willing to make a loss on the sale.

In fact, "loss-making deals" have their own tricks! Today you give a peach, tomorrow I return a plum. Those few "discount coupons" given to brother units might, at some point, with just a note, allow you to recover your investment many times over!

Currently, the phenomenon of arbitrary price increases for goods in high demand by consumers has drawn significant attention from relevant departments, which are actively investigating and addressing the issue. However, the aforementioned "discounted sales" are largely ignored. Some even simply believe that since consumers are not harmed, the loss is borne by the enterprises themselves.

I believe that engaging in "discount pricing" has three main issues: first, it reduces the state's legitimate business tax revenue; second, it artificially creates social distribution inequalities (equal amounts of money exchanging for unequal amounts of goods); third, it consciously or unconsciously provides a certain "legal" means for power-for-personal-gain behavior. This kind of discount pricing is different from the commercial sector's practice of selling at a low profit margin to increase sales volume.

### “优惠价格”质疑

　　“优惠价格”质疑
　　许伯贤
    某单位业务科长到一家商场购物，洽谈毕，只听商场会计对这位科长说：“咱们经理说了，这批货虽很紧俏，但仍按进货价格八折优惠卖给你们。”旁人不解，既是俏货，为啥愿做赔本买卖？
    其实，“赔本生意”自有它的妙用！今日你投之以桃，明朝我报之以李，给兄弟单位的那几张“优惠券”说不定哪时，一张便条，就可以让你数十倍、百倍地得到回收！
    目前，对消费者呼声较大的商品乱涨价行为，有关部门比较重视并注意查处；而对上述的所谓“优惠贱卖”现象，则漠然视之。甚至简单地认为，反正消费者没有受损害，吃亏的是企业自己。
    我想搞“优惠价格”，其一、减少了国家正当营业税收；其二、人为地制造社会分配不公（等量货币换取不等量商品）；其三、自觉或不自觉地为以权谋私行为提供了某种“合法”手段。这种优惠价格与商业部门薄利多销是两码事。
