April 1st marked the fourth anniversary of the implementation of China's Patent Law. Over the past four years, Chinese patent institutions have received over 90,000 domestic and international patent applications, with an average annual growth rate of 27%. In 1988 alone, 34,000 patent applications were received, a 30% increase from the previous year, with foreign applications rising by 23%. In the same year, 12,000 patents were granted, exceeding the total number of patents granted in the previous three years by 20%.

Patent management agencies have also made significant progress in terms of speed and quality in patent agency and review processes. There are now 435 patent agencies nationwide, with 4,800 qualified agents, forming a relatively complete system.

China's patent system has played an active role in reversing the separation of scientific and technological work from economic construction, promoting the shift of economic work to rely on technological progress. As European Patent Office Director Mr. Brandley commented, "This infant is developing very healthily, and the world can hear her voice, which is surprising."

However, any new endeavor is bound to have flaws and shortcomings. Upon conducting some investigations and calm analysis, it is not difficult to discover the joys and sorrows within China's patent industry.

An Imbalanced Patent Application Structure

Over the past four years, the proportion of patent applications for inventions, utility models, and industrial designs has been 36.9%, 58%, and 5.1% respectively. The proportion of inventions has decreased from 59.5% in 1985 to 28.4% last year, which is less than half of the 65.9% for utility models.

In China, the most active fields for patent applications are furniture, household items, computing and counting, and medical and health-related small inventions. In contrast, foreign applications are concentrated in information technology, computers, and high-polymer compounds.

Statistics also reflect that the proportion of individual invention patent applications has been steadily increasing, finally surpassing institutional applications last year to reach 52.7%. On one hand, this indicates that China's patent system has encouraged individual innovation, but on the other hand, it reflects that Chinese enterprises and institutions do not sufficiently value their own intellectual property.

The rapid increase in individual invention patent applications, from one perspective, reflects China's underdeveloped scientific and technological level. Modern large-scale production emphasizes cooperation. Individuals, limited by various conditions, have fewer opportunities for high-tech inventions and can only focus on small, everyday innovations, which are limited to "courtyard-style" small-scale production.

At the same time, enterprises' attention to patent applications is still far from sufficient. The traditional mindset of "one achievement, shared by a hundred" still exists in many enterprises, allowing them to easily adopt technologies from other enterprises. This is also one of the reasons for the imbalance in patent applications.

Weak Patent Awareness

When China's Patent Law was enacted, it was praised both domestically and internationally as a unique regulation. However, in practice, few people understand it, and even fewer people value and use it to protect their rights.

Many people view patents as a form of "honor" rather than a right. You often see advertisements like, "This product has been awarded a national patent," similar to winning a "National ×× Award." This misunderstanding is hard to blame on the advertising companies, as the general public also considers it natural.

Some people often prioritize administrative intervention over the legal effects of patent rights. While administrative intervention may still play a role in the current domestic market, where legal awareness is weak and commodity consciousness is not strong, it will not have a place in the international market.

A certain mechanical factory under the Aerospace Industry Department imported composite plastic NAS sheet material technology from the United States, which has been patented in 116 countries. However, neither party mentioned this in the contract. Only after the factory had invested over 20 million yuan in the project did they accidentally discover this. If the domestic market becomes saturated and the product is exported to a patented country, it would constitute infringement. Despite the factory's efforts, the contract has already taken effect, and the loss is irrecoverable.

Similar situations have been discovered multiple times. Our patent awareness seems to be awakened only when our own interests are affected. If this continues, by the time we universally possess patent awareness, the losses will be immeasurable!

Imbalanced Patent Implementation

According to a sample survey, China's patent implementation rate was approximately 30% last year, which is relatively high compared to other countries, but there are still significant issues:

First, there is a lack of specialized institutions for overall management. In a market economy that is not yet fully developed and where patent awareness is weak, relying solely on market self-regulation will inevitably result in many oversights.

Second, non-employment inventions are more prevalent in implemented projects, while employment inventions are less so. This is because non-employment inventors pay close attention to the feasibility of their inventions during the research process and also hope to gain economic benefits from their inventions as soon as possible. Employment inventions, however, are often shelved.

Third, more patents are implemented in township enterprises, while large enterprises have fewer. Township enterprises and small enterprises that implement many patent technologies often face issues with funding, equipment, and technology, affecting the further development of products and sometimes even failing to meet the inventors' expectations. Some even waste raw materials and technology. Large enterprises, due to their lack of flexibility, are slow to adopt new achievements, which is concerning.

Premier Li Peng pointed out: The ultimate goal of the Patent Law is to quickly convert invention achievements into productive forces. The economic and social benefits of inventions and creations can only be generated through implementation. Some regions have begun to recognize this problem and organize enterprise patent implementation groups. Shandong Province's Rongcheng Brake Device Factory, in May 1987, collaborated with five township enterprises and 22 production points to form the Rongcheng Brake Device Patent Implementation Group. This is a beneficial attempt, but it is still too rare.

### 专利事业的长足与跛脚

　　专利事业的长足与跛脚
    李琦　欧阳志国
    今年４月１日是我国专利法实施４周年。
    ４年来，我国专利机构共受理国内外专利申请９万多件，平均年递增率达２７％。其中，１９８８年受理专利申请３．４万多件，比上年增长３０％，来自国外的专利申请数量比上年增长２３％。当年授予专利权１．２万多件，比前３年授权数量的总和还要多２０％。
    专利管理机关在代理和审批专利的速度、质量上也有了长足的进步。全国各地已有专利代理机构４３５家，经考核合格的代理人４８００名，已初步形成了一个比较完整的体系。
    我国的专利制度为扭转科技工作与经济建设相分离的状况，促使经济工作转移到依靠技术进步的轨道上来，发挥了积极作用。正如欧洲专利局局长布兰德利先生所评价：“这个婴儿发育得很健康，全世界都能听到她的声音，令人感到惊奇。”
    但是，一项新的事业总难免有缺陷和不足。一旦我们作一些调查和冷静的分析，不难发现我国专利事业的喜中之忧。
    倾斜的专利申请结构
    ４年来，发明、实用新型和外观设计类的专利申请数分别占总数的３６．９％、５８％和５．１％。发明所占的比例由１９８５年的５９．５％，逐年下降至去年的２８．４％，只有实用新型类６５．９％的一半还不到。
    在我国的专利申请中，最活跃的领域是家具、家庭用品、计算计数和医药卫生等小发明。而国外的申请则集中在信息、计算机、高分子化合物等技术领域。
    统计表还反映了这样一个现象：个人发明专利申请所占的比例稳步上升，终于在去年超过了单位申请，占５２．７％。这一方面说明我国的专利制度鼓励了个人发明创造的积极性，但也反映出我国的企、事业单位对自己发明创造的产权，重视程度不够。
    个人发明专利申请数量的猛增，从一个角度反映出我国科技水平的不发达。现代化大生产讲究协作。个人受各方面条件的限制，高技术领域的发明可能性较小，只能搞一些日常生活的小发明，这种小发明投入生产仅限于“庭院式”的小生产。
    同时，企业对专利申请的重视程度还远远不够。“一家成果，百家共享”，这种传统的意识在许多企业仍然存在，一些企业往往可以毫不费力地采用别家企业的技术。这也是造成专利申请结构不平衡的原因之一。
    淡薄的专利意识
    我国专利法诞生时，国内外一致盛赞：这是一部有特色的法规。然而从实施中看，不仅了解它的人并不多，重视并善于运用它来维护自己权益的就更少了。
    更多的人把专利看成是一种“荣誉”而不是权利。你常常可以看到这样的广告：“本产品已荣获国家专利”。就如同获得“国家××奖”一样。这种误解很难怪罪于做广告的厂家，因为广大的群众也视之为当然。
    一些人往往重视行政干预，不大理会专利权的法律效果。如果说在目前法律意识淡薄、商品观念不太强的国内市场，一定范围内的行政干预，还不失为一种机制，能发挥一定作用的话，那么在国际市场恐怕就不会再有它的容身之地。
    航天航空部某机械厂从美国引进的复合塑料ＮＡＳ片材工艺，已在１１６个国家取得了专利保护。可在签订协议时，双方均未提及。当该厂已为此项目投资２０００多万元后，才偶然间发现。如果国内市场饱和，出口到专利国就要发生侵权。尽管厂家做了许多努力，但协议已生效，损失难以挽回。
    类似的情况目前已发现多起。我们的专利意识似乎只有在触及自己切身利益时才被唤醒。这样下去，等到我们真正普遍具有专利意识时，损失真不知还要多少！
    失调的专利实施
    据抽样调查，去年我国的专利实施率约为３０％左右，与其它国家比较是较高的，但也存在着不可忽视的问题：
    一是缺少专门的机构进行统筹管理。在商品经济不够发达、专利意识不强的中国，仅由市场自发调节，必然挂一漏十。
    二是实施的项目中非职务发明多，职务发明少。这是因为非职务发明人在研究过程中非常注意它的可行性，同时又希望尽早获得发明的经济效益。而职务发明则往往被束之高阁。
    三是在乡镇企业实施的项目较多，大企业较少。实施专利技术多的乡镇企业、小企业，往往由于资金、设备和技术不足而影响了产品的进一步开发，甚至不能达到发明人预期的目的，有些还浪费了原材料和技术。大企业由于灵活性不够，采用新成果动作迟缓，实在堪忧。
    李鹏总理指出：专利法的最终目的是使发明创造成果尽快转化为生产力，发明创造的经济效益和社会效益只有通过实施才能产生。一些地区已开始意识到这个问题并组织企业专利实施集团。山东省的荣成县刹车装置总厂，１９８７年５月联合了５个乡镇企业、２２个生产点组成了荣成刹车装置专利实施集团。这是一种有益的尝试，但毕竟太少。
