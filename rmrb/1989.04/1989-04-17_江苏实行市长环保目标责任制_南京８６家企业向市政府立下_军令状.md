	Jiangsu Implements Mayor Environmental Protection Target Responsibility System
	86 Enterprises in Nanjing Pledge to Municipal Government

	Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, April 17 — Recently, the legal representatives of 86 industrial enterprises in Nanjing signed the "Enterprise Environmental Protection Target Responsibility Book," pledging to the municipal government on environmental issues.

	This action by Nanjing is a prelude to Jiangsu's implementation of an environmental protection responsibility system across the entire province. The provincial government recently decided that in the first half of this year, mayors of various cities will sign environmental protection target responsibility statements with the governor, making environmental protection an important part of evaluating the performance of mayors.

	The mayor's environmental protection target responsibility statement includes: environmental quality targets, which are the overall environmental quality levels to be achieved, such as the annual and daily average values of total suspended particulates in the air, drinking water source water quality, and water quality standards for major rivers; environmental governance targets, such as the amount of wastewater discharged per ten thousand yuan of industrial output, the industrial wastewater treatment rate, the comprehensive utilization rate of solid waste, and the reduction amount of major pollutants; environmental target management, such as the construction of environmental governance projects, and the implementation rate of environmental protection targets, etc. The responsibility statement also sets annual environmental protection targets to facilitate annual assessments.

	To ensure the establishment and implementation of the mayor's environmental protection responsibility system, some municipal governments first took the initiative to sign responsibility statements with major industrial enterprises. After conducting comprehensive environmental monitoring of 86 enterprises, the Nanjing Municipal Government, together with the Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, the Economic Commission, and the Financial Bureau, jointly formulated the trial measures for the environmental protection target responsibility system, and first implemented the environmental protection target responsibility system in these 86 enterprises.

　　江苏实行市长环保目标责任制
　　南京８６家企业向市政府立下“军令状”
    新华社南京４月１７日电　南京市８６家工业企业的法人代表最近在《企业环境保护目标责任书》上签字，就环境问题向市政府立下了“军令状”。
    南京市的这一行动，是江苏在全省范围内推行环境保护负责制的前奏。省政府不久前作出决定，今年上半年，各市市长将与省长签定环境保护目标责任状，把保护环境列为考核市长政绩的重要内容。
    市长环境保护目标责任状包括：环境质量目标，即总体环境质量要达到的水平，如大气总悬浮微粒年、日平均值，饮用水源水质和主要河流水质标准等；环境治理目标，即全市万元产值废水排放量，工业废水处理率，固体废弃物综合利用率，主要污染物削减量等；环境目标管理，即环境治理项目的建设，环境保护目标的执行率等等。责任状还订立年度环境保护目标，以利于逐年考核。
    为了确保市长环境保护责任制的建立和实施，一些市政府先着手同主要工业企业签订责任书。南京市政府在对８６家企业进行全面环保监测后，由市环保局、经委、财政局共同制定了环境保护目标责任制试行办法，首先在这８６家企业推行了环境保护目标责任制。
