Near the iron railings at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield, people silently placed flowers and wreaths to mourn the 108 individuals who tragically lost their lives in the stadium on the afternoon of April 15. The expressions of sorrow and grief, the slow and heavy footsteps, and the silent, solemn prayers all indicated that the British people had been deeply saddened by the loss of 108 friends, colleagues, and family members.

It is estimated that among these fans was a 10-year-old boy, and the incident directly caused over 9,000 British citizens to suffer from psychological trauma requiring treatment. President George H.W. Bush, French President François Mitterrand, and others sent messages to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher expressing their deepest sympathies and condolences to the victims and their families.

At around 3 PM on April 15, the stadium was filled with spectators. The FA Cup semi-final match between the renowned Liverpool team and Nottingham Forest was about to begin. A 17-year-old girl had waited 14 hours outside the stadium to watch the match. Liverpool fans, despite the long journey, had traveled to Sheffield, and it was not uncommon to see entire families in attendance. Although the match started on time at 3 PM and the gates were closed, there were still three to four thousand fans demanding entry, creating a situation that the police described as a "dangerous crowd."

At around 3:06 PM, the police, fearing that the massive crowd pressure "could cause the walls to collapse," opened a gate to relieve the pressure. Fans (many of whom reportedly had no tickets) rushed in, surging towards a stand behind Liverpool's goal. The crowd swelled like a tide, wave after wave. People at the front of the stand were gradually pushed against the sturdy metal railings. The excessive crowding and unbearable pressure caused many to become anxious, agitated, and struggle for breath, emitting desperate cries. People shouted at the police, "Open the iron gate!" In a desperate bid for survival, some people climbed over the 8-foot-high metal railings; about 200 people were pulled to safety by spectators on the upper tier; over 2,000 people entered the field through the gate opened by the police; but many still had no way out, and even some strong men succumbed to the immense pressure, suffocating and fainting. Many of the victims were crushed to death in front of the metal railings. Ambulances entered the field, and stretchers moved through the crowd. Injured police officers selflessly rescued those in critical condition, and medical personnel performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on the suffocating victims.

The Hillsborough disaster sounded an alarm, bringing the issue of sports venue safety back to the forefront.

In British and international football history, similar incidents have occurred more than ten times, with various causes: sometimes due to riots, sometimes fires, sometimes natural disasters, and sometimes overcrowding. The Hillsborough disaster was caused by overcrowding. In fact, with past incidents as a reference, observers here believe that "over the past three years, the behavior of British football fans in stadiums has improved significantly." British stadiums have been continuously improving their safety facilities, and some local authorities require stadiums in their areas to obtain "safety certificates." The goal is to prevent fans from rushing into the field to disrupt the game or assault opposing fans. This is naturally an important aspect of controlling incidents and overcrowding. But this tragedy reminds us that new, more comprehensive safety measures need to be considered. After the accident, the British government believed that issuing identity cards to fans and ensuring that every spectator has a seat in the stadium is necessary. Experts also called for strengthening the emergency response system in stadiums to ensure the safety of spectators.

This disaster also resonated within the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). In 1985, during the European Cup final in Brussels, Belgium, Liverpool fans caused trouble and were sanctioned by UEFA, leading to British football clubs being unable to participate in European football competitions. Due to the improvement in the situation over the past few years, UEFA decided to allow British football clubs to return to the European football family during the 1990-1991 season. After the Hillsborough disaster, there were reports that this decision might be postponed, but UEFA has confirmed that the Hillsborough disaster will not affect its original decision.

The Hillsborough disaster is not only the most devastating tragedy in British football history but also a tragic chapter in international football history. Liverpool has declared a week of mourning for the victims. April 15 will be remembered as a "black day" in the memories of the British people. Whether from radio or television, one can hear the resolute voices of people from all walks of life, especially those in the football community, declaring, "We will never let this day be repeated again!"

　　希尔斯堡惨案纪实
    本报记者  陈特安
    在设菲尔德市希尔斯堡体育场铁栅栏旁，人们默默地献上鲜花和挽联，寄托对４月１５日下午在绿茵场内不幸遇难者的哀思。那悲伤、沉痛的表情，沉重缓慢的步履，默默庄重的祷告，表明英国人近日来一直沉浸在失去１０８位朋友、同事、亲人的极大悲痛之中。
    据估计，这些球迷其中还包括一名刚满１０岁的男童的惨逝，直接给９千多英国公民造成需要进行心理治疗的“心理创伤”。美国总统布什、法国总统密特朗等纷纷给撒切尔夫人发电，对死难者及家属深表同情和慰问。
    １５日下午３时许，希尔斯堡体育场内外人山人海，英国足协杯半决赛将在久负盛名的利物浦队与诺丁汉福里斯特队之间进行。一个１７岁的女孩为观看这场比赛，在体育场外等了１４小时之久。利物浦的球迷们不顾路途遥远，专程赶到设菲尔德，全家出动的也非少见。尽管比赛于３点准时开始，大门已经关闭，但还有三四千球迷要求入场，其势犹如浪涛拍岸，形成警察惊呼的“危险拥挤”。
    ３点６分左右，警察担心巨大人流压力“会导致围墙倒塌而出危险”，为减轻压力，就打开了一个门。球迷们（据说许多人无票）蜂拥而入，涌向靠近利物浦队球门后面的一个看台。人流如潮，一浪紧似一浪。看台前边的人渐渐被推挤到坚固的金属栅栏跟前。过度拥挤、不堪承受的挤压使许多人焦急、烦燥、挣扎、窒息，并发出垂危的尖叫。人们对警察大喊：“打开铁门！”为了活命，有的人不顾一切地翻越８英尺高的金属栅栏；２００多人被高一层看台的观众合力拉上去而脱险；２０００多人从警察打开的通向赛场的入口门进入赛场；而许多人仍无处脱身，甚至连一些壮汉也抵挡不住巨大的压力而窒息、晕倒……遇难者（包括后来在医院丧生者）不少是被挤死在金属栅栏前的。救护车开进绿茵场地，一副副担架在人群中穿来跑去，受伤的警察忘我抢救生命垂危者，医护人员给窒息者作“嘴对嘴”的人工呼吸……
    希尔斯堡灾难敲响了警钟，把注意运动场地安全问题再次提到人们面前。
    在英国以至国际足球运动史上，此类事故已发生过十多起，原因也是多样的：有时是闹事斗殴，有时是失火，有时是天灾，有时则是过度拥挤。希尔斯堡灾难就是由于过度拥挤而引起的。事实上，由于已有前辙可鉴，此间观察家认为，“在过去的三年里，英国的球迷们在运动场内的举止行为已有明显改善”，英国各大体育场也在不断改进自己的安全设施，有些地方当局还要求所在地的体育场要取得“安全证书”。其目的在于阻止球迷冲进球场干扰比赛或殴打支持对手的观众。这自然是控制肇事和拥挤的重要方面。但这场悲剧又提醒人们：需要考虑采取新的更周全的安全措施。事故发生后英国政府认为，给球迷们发放身份卡、体育场内保证让每个观众都有座位是需要的。同时，有关专家还呼吁，要切实加强体育场的急救系统，以确保观众安全。
    这场灾难在欧洲足球协会联盟也引起了反响。１９８５年在比利时布鲁塞尔举行的欧洲杯决赛，利物浦球迷闹事，受到欧洲足联制裁，英国足球俱乐部从此未能参加欧洲足球俱乐部的比赛。由于近几年情况已有改善，欧洲足联已决定１９９０至１９９１年间让英国足球俱乐部回到欧洲足球大家庭。希尔斯堡灾难发生后，曾有报道说，这一决定可能因此而搁浅，但欧洲足联已确认，希尔斯堡灾难不影响它原来的决定。
    希尔斯堡灾难不仅是英国足球运动史上最惨重的灾难，也是国际足球运动史上悲惨的一页。利物浦市已宣布为死难者哀悼一周。４月１５日将作为“黑色的一天”留在英国人的记忆里，无论从广播还是电视里，都可以听到各界人士，尤其是足球界人士斩钉截铁的声音：“决不让这一天重演！”（附图片）
