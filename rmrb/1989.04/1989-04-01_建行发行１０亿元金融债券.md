Starting from early April, the China Construction Bank will issue 1 billion yuan in cumulative interest financial bonds to individuals in cities and rural areas nationwide.

The financial bonds issued by the bank this year have an interest rate that floats with the adjustment of savings deposit interest rates, always maintaining a level higher than the same-period savings deposit interest rate. Taking the current deposit interest rate as an example: if the one-year deposit interest rate is 11.34%, purchasing a bond with a face value of 100 yuan, after one year, the interest earned will be 13.34 yuan, with a total of 113.34 yuan in principal and interest. If the savings deposit interest rate is raised in the future, the interest rate of the bonds issued by the bank will also be correspondingly increased. The bond term is 1-3 years, and after one year from the purchase period, it can be redeemed at any time, with the remaining period paying interest according to the current savings deposit interest rate. The bond face values are 100 yuan, 500 yuan, and 1,000 yuan.

　　建行发行１０亿元金融债券
    本报北京３月３１日讯  从４月初开始，中国人民建设银行向全国城乡个人发行１０亿元累进利率金融债券。
    该行今年发行的金融债券，利率随储蓄存款利率的调整而浮动，始终高于同期储蓄存款利率水平。以现行存款利率为例：如一年期存款利率１１．３４％，购买面额１００元的债券，满一年可得利息１３．３４元，本息合计１１３．３４元。今后若储蓄存款利率调高，该行发行的债券利率也相应提高。债券期限为１—３年，在购券期满一年后即可随时兑取，不足部分按活期储蓄存款利率计付利息。债券面额分为１００元、５００元、１０００元三种。　（席德炎）
