The 12 member states of the European Community are expected to establish a unified market for the free flow of goods, services, people, and capital by January 1, 1993. To achieve this goal, many obstacles need to be removed, and coordinating the tax systems of member countries is one of them. In February, the European Community Commission proposed that member countries impose a tax of at least 15% on private capital income (deposit interest, securities interest, but excluding stock dividends) and adopt a source tax method. This puts France, which has a relatively high tax rate, in a more difficult position compared to other member countries.

France's tax revenue accounts for approximately 45% of its GDP, which is 5-7 percentage points higher than its major partner countries. If it were to align with its major partners in this regard, it would lose about 350 billion francs annually. France's tax system is complex, with over 50 different types of taxes. In the process of building a unified market within the European Community, the tax system, like wages, interest rates, and technology, has become an important competitive tool. However, France's current tax system clearly lacks competitiveness.

Taking the example of bond income tax, France's rate is 27%, Italy's is 12.5%, West Germany's is 10%, and Luxembourg's is 0. Additionally, France implements the famous Ouvrier monitoring system, where banks must report citizens' income to tax authorities, making the tax authorities fully aware of their citizens' income. Among the European Community countries, only Spain and Denmark have similar systems, while other countries' banks follow an anonymous system, with West Germany even including it in their constitution.

The European Community has decided to start with the free flow of capital in eight countries—England, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, West Germany, and Denmark—beginning July 1, 1990. French media have estimated that after July 1, 1990, France's capital will flow in large quantities to low-tax countries. It seems that this concern is not unfounded. For example, someone moved their assets to Switzerland as early as 1981, and now they want to transfer this money to West Germany to avoid France's tax monitoring.

The French government, of course, cannot remain indifferent to such situations. European Affairs Minister Edith Cresson recently stated that France is prepared to make sacrifices and reform its tax system, starting by reducing the savings interest tax to 15%. However, this would result in France losing 150-200 billion francs in tax revenue for the 1990 fiscal year. To compensate, the French government plans to take two measures: establishing a proportional tax system for all citizens' income and changing the method of income tax collection.

Reducing the savings interest tax is just the beginning of France's tax reform. How France's tax system will further change is a matter of concern for everyone.

　　法国的税改难题
　　杨贵兰
    欧共体１２国预计在１９９３年１月１日前建成商品、劳务、人员和资本自由流通的统一大市场。而要实现这个目标，还要排除许多障碍，协调各成员国的税制便是其中之一。２月间，欧共体委员会建议对成员国的私人资本收益（存款利息、有价证券利息，但股票收益除外）征收至少１５％的税，且采取泉源课税办法。这就使税率较高的法国面临着比其他成员国更为棘手的难题。
    法国的捐税收入约占国内生产总值的４５％，比其主要伙伴国高出５—７个百分点。在这方面，若要它与其主要伙伴国看齐，那它每年将少收入３５００亿法郎。法国税制复杂，各色捐税多达５０多种。在欧共体建设统一大市场的过程中，税制就像工资、利率和工艺技术一样成了重要竞争手段，而法国目前的税制显然缺乏竞争力。
    以债券收益税为例，法国的税率为２７％，意大利为１２．５％，西德为１０％，而卢森堡为０。此外，法国还执行著名的奥韦尔监控制度，即银行必须向税务机关通报公民的收入情况，因此，法国税务机关对其国民的收入情况了如指掌。在欧共体国家当中，只有西班牙和丹麦有类似制度，而其他国家的银行均采取匿名制，西德还将匿名制写进了宪法。
    欧共体已决定从１９９０年７月１日起，先在英、法、意、荷、比、卢、西德、丹麦８国中实现资本自由流通，法国报刊据此估计，１９９０年７月１日以后，法国的资本将大量流向低税国家。看来，这种担心并排杞人忧天。例如，有人早在１９８１年就将其钱财移至瑞士，现在他又要把这笔钱转移到西德，以逃避法国税务机关的监控。
    法国政府对这类情况当然不人漠然处之。欧洲事务部长埃迪特·克勒松不久前表示，法国准备作出牺牲，进行税制改革，先将储蓄利息税降至１５％。但这么一来，法国１９９０财政年度的税收将损失１５０亿至２００亿法郎。为作补偿，法国政府准备采取两项措施，即对公民的所有收入设立比例税制，同时改变收入税的征收方式。
    降低储蓄利息税是法国税改的开始，法国的税制如何进一步改革，是人们关心的问题。
