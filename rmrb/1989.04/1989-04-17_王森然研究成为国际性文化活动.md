Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 16th.

Research on Wang Senran, which began in mainland China just a few years ago, has already garnered responses from many overseas individuals, becoming an international cultural activity.

Wang Senran, born in 1895 and passed away in 1984, was a renowned revolutionary, thinker, educator, historian, literary figure, linguist, and traditional Chinese painter in modern Chinese history. His extensive contributions and profound influence are well-known. Shortly after Wang Senran's passing, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Ministry of Culture jointly held a commemorative meeting for the 70th anniversary of Professor Wang Senran's teaching career, marking the beginning of large-scale research on Wang Senran. In June of last year, the Chinese Wang Senran Academic Research Association was established in Beijing. The 185-member council of the association includes many well-known figures from China, as well as several international friends: former Italian President Sandro Pertini, the first U.S. Ambassador to China Leonard Woodcock, and former Belgian Ambassador to China Roger D'Hooghe.

In January of this year, Japanese scholars who have long been engaged in the study of Wang Senran's historical and literary thought established the Japanese Wang Senran Association in Tokyo and set up the Wang Senran Art Foundation to reward outstanding artists from China and Japan. In February, the Hong Kong Wang Senran Academic Research Association was officially established. In March, the Dutch Wang Senran Academic Affairs Friendship Association was founded. Preparatory committees for similar associations have also been established in France, the United Kingdom, Belgium, and the Federal Republic of Germany.

These organizations not only conduct research on Wang Senran's life, works, and influence but also use this as a starting point to engage in broader international cultural exchange activities. In October 1988, the Chinese Wang Senran Academic Research Association awarded the Art History Scholarship at the Central Academy of Fine Arts and is preparing to establish national-level awards for art criticism, biographical literature, art creation, and secondary education.

　　王森然研究成为国际性文化活动
    新华社北京４月１６日电　（记者邵建武）王森然研究在中国大陆起步虽只有短短几年，却得到许多海外人士的响应，成为一项国际性文化活动。
    生于１８９５年，死于１９８４年的王森然，是中国现代史上知名的革命家、思想家、教育家、史学家、文学家、语言文字学家和国画家，他一生建树广博，影响巨大。王森然逝世不久，全国政协和文化部联合召开王森然教授执教７０周年纪念会，自此开始了较大规模的王森然研究工作。去年６月，中国王森然学术研究会在北京成立。由１８５人组成的研究会理事会不仅有许多国内知名人士，还有一些国际友人：意大利前总统桑德罗·佩尔蒂尼，美国首任驻华大使伦纳德·伍德科克，比利时前驻华大使罗杰·德诺睦等。
    今年１月，长期从事王森然史学和文艺学思想研究的日本学者在东京成立了日本王森然学会，并建立以王森然命名的美术奖基金会，奖励中日两国的优秀美术人才；２月，香港王森然学术研究会宣告成立；３月，荷兰王森然学术事业联谊会问世；法国、英国、比利时、联邦德国等国也建立了学会的筹备机构。
    这些组织不仅开展了对王森然生平著述及其影响的研究，还以此为基点，开展了更为广泛的国际文化交流活动。１９８８年１０月，中国王森然学术研究会在中央美术学院颁发了美术史奖学金，并在筹备设立全国性的文艺批评奖、传记文学奖、美术创作奖、中等教育奖。
