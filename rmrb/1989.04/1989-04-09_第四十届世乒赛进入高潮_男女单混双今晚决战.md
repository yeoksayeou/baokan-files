The 40th World Table Tennis Championships has reached its climax. The men's and women's singles and mixed doubles will decide tonight.

The men's and women's singles matches today underwent intense battles in the fourth and fifth rounds, producing the top four. The men's singles semifinalists include China's Yu Shenglong, who will face Sweden's Persson tomorrow to compete for a spot in the final. The defending runner-up, Sweden's Waldner, will face Poland's Grubba in another semifinal.

The women's singles semifinalists include China's Chen Zhen, Qiao Hong, North Korea's Li Bunji, and South Korea's Hyun Jung-hwa.

Today, China's young player Yu Shenglong performed well. In the fourth round, he faced Sweden's star Lindh and, after a grueling four-game battle, eliminated his opponent with a score of 3-1. The 27-year-old Xu Zengcai eliminated the Olympic men's singles champion Liu Nam-kyu with a score of 3-1.

China's female players excelled in the doubles matches, with four pairs advancing to the semifinals. Chen Zhen and Hu Xiaoxin defeated Ding Yaping and Li Jun in the semifinals with a score of 2-1.

In the men's doubles, two pairs of Chinese players both lost in the semifinals. The double champions of the last World Table Tennis Championships and the Olympics, Chen Longcan and Wei Qingguang, faced the deafening cheers of the entire audience and performed awkwardly, losing 1-2 to West Germany's Rosskopf and Fetschner. Teng Yi and Hui Jin also lost 2-1 to Poland's Kucharski and Yugoslavia's Kalinic after leading by one game.

In the mixed doubles, China has four pairs advancing to the top 8, and the semifinals and finals will be held tomorrow.
