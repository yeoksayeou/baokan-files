	Who would have thought that growing pumpkins could enrich an entire village? But this is a true story. The village in question is Wólóng Tún in Jílín Province.

	This village has 35 households, 170 people, and a total of over 300 mu of farmland. Due to the high mountains, dense forests, steep slopes, and thin soil, the grain yield here has always been low, and the people have always been poor. In 1984, the per capita income was only 180 yuan. The village collectively owed 400,000 yuan in loans, with an average of 11,430 yuan per household. The villagers were so poor that they had no choice but to move away every year.

	In the past, this village also grew pumpkins. They would sell some pumpkin seeds for a bit of money. However, because the planting was scattered and the management was sloppy, the yield was very low. In 1986, the Huàdiàn Pumpkin Seed Planting and Processing Training Class was listed as a national-level "Star Spark" project, and the county organized a high-yield pumpkin seed cultivation technology training class. The village sent someone to participate in the training. From then on, they started planting pumpkins on a large scale.

	In 1986, the entire village planted 150 mu of pumpkins, earning 180,000 yuan, and the per capita income increased to 290 yuan. Everyone was overjoyed. The following year, they planted over 200 mu, earning 450,000 yuan. In 1988, the village further expanded its pumpkin planting area to 375 mu, producing 22,500 jin of pumpkin seeds, earning over 1.2 million yuan, which accounted for 68% of the total agricultural income. Just from selling pumpkin seeds, the per capita income reached 714 yuan. Adding other incomes, the per capita income exceeded 1,000 yuan. Farmer Wáng Wànqiú, for example, planted 12 mu of pumpkins last year, harvested 1,180 jin of pumpkin seeds, and earned 6,372 yuan.

	Income increased year by year, and the poor village's appearance changed. Over the past two years, farmers have voluntarily repaid the overdue loans of over 300,000 yuan to the bank. Last year, they were the first in the entire township to complete the agricultural tax payment. Now, not only is there no one moving away, but many farmers are busy preparing materials to build brick houses. Farmer Dīng Xiǎnfēng, who had transferred his household registration, still hasn't moved. Last year, he sold 5,200 jin of pumpkin seeds, earning over 5,200 yuan. Adding income from growing grain and raising chickens, his total income exceeded 10,000 yuan. When asked when he would move, he said, "When the pumpkin seeds are no longer valuable, then I will move."

　　南瓜富了卧龙屯
    刘继贵
    谁也没想到，种南瓜竟能富了一个屯。但这是真事。这个屯就是吉林省的卧龙屯。
    这个屯共有３５户，１７０口人，总共３００多亩田。由于山高林密，坡陡土薄，这里粮食产量一直很低，人也很穷，１９８４年人均收入只有１８０元。全屯累计欠贷款达４万多元，户均１１４３元。屯里的农民穷得没招儿，年年有搬走的。
    过去，这个屯也种植南瓜。抠点白瓜籽卖钱。但因种植零星，管理粗放，产量很低。１９８６年，桦甸种植加工南瓜籽培训班，项目被列入国家级星火计划，县里举办了白瓜籽高产栽培技术培训班，这个屯派专人参加学习。打那以后，就大种开了。
    １９８６年，全屯种了１５０亩，收入了１．８万元，人均收入一下达到了２９０元，大伙别提多乐了。第二年又种了２００多亩，收入４．５万元。１９８８年全屯南瓜面积进一步扩大到３７５亩，产白瓜籽２．２５万公斤，收入达到１２万多元，占农业总收入的６８％，仅出售白瓜籽，全屯人均收入达到了７１４元，加上其它收入全屯人均收入超过了千元。农民王万秋，去年种植南瓜１２亩，收获白瓜籽１１８０公斤，收入６３７２元。
    收入年年翻，穷屯面貌变。这两年来，农民主动到银行还了拖欠贷款３万多元，去年又在全乡第一个完成了农业税缴纳任务。现在不但没有搬家的了，还有不少农民忙着备料盖砖瓦房。农民丁显凤，户口转走了，人还没走，去年出售白瓜籽收入５２００多元，加上种粮、养鸡等，收入过了万。别人问他什么时候搬家，他说，什么时候白瓜籽不值钱了，什么时候再搬。
