China's representative Yuan Shiping today at the 11th session of the United Nations Commission on International Communications urged developed countries and developing countries to closely cooperate and establish a new international news and communication order as soon as possible on the basis of equal sovereignty of all countries.

Yuan Shiping pointed out that the imbalance in the basic structure of news communication and information flow is still evident, and the gap between developing countries and developed countries remains very large. Developing countries' dependence on developed countries in the field of news and communication has not been eliminated.

Yuan Shiping said that this situation is fundamentally detrimental to the international community, especially to the development of Third World countries. It also causes losses to developed countries due to insufficient correct information.

Therefore, he said, it is urgent and necessary to establish a new world news and communication order. This new order will enable news to be disseminated more widely and balanced, and ensure the diversity of news sources. This will promote the true participation of the people of all countries in political, economic, social, and cultural affairs, strengthen mutual understanding and friendship between countries and their peoples, and accelerate the peaceful coexistence and common prosperity of all peoples of the world.

Yuan Shiping particularly pointed out that the establishment of a new international news communication order should respect the sovereignty of all countries, respect the choices of the peoples of all countries, and their social values and cultural traditions.

He called on developed countries and developing countries to cooperate more closely in this regard. He hoped that the representatives of more than 70 countries participating in this meeting would, on the basis of seeking common ground while reserving differences, proceed from the overall interests of the international community, and strive to establish a new international news communication order as soon as possible.

　　我代表在联合国新闻委员会会议上呼吁
　　发达与发展中国家密切合作
　　建立国际新闻与传播新秩序
    新华社联合国４月１８日电　中国代表袁士槟今天在联合国新闻委员会第１１届会议上呼吁发达国家与发展中国家密切合作，尽早在各国主权平等的基础上建立新的国际新闻与传播秩序。
    袁士槟指出，当前新闻传播的基础结构及信息流通等方面的不平衡现象依然显而易见，发展中国家和发达国家之间的差距仍然十分巨大，发展中国家在新闻与传播方面对发达国家的依赖状态仍未消除。
    袁士槟说，这种状况从根本上说不利于国际社会，特别是第三世界国家的发展，而且也使发达国家由于没有足够的正确的信息而遭受损失。
    因此，他说，建立一种新的世界新闻和传播秩序是迫切和必要的，因为这种新秩序将使新闻能够更广泛和平衡地传播，并保证新闻来源的多样化，从而促进各国人民真正参与政治、经济、社会和文化事务，加强各国及其人民之间的相互了解和友谊，加速全世界人民的和平共处，共同繁荣。
    袁士槟特别指出，建立国际新闻传播新秩序要尊重各国的主权，尊重各国人民的选择以及他们的社会价值观念和文化传统。
    他呼吁发达国家与发展中国家在这一方面进行更为密切的合作，希望参加这次会议的７０多个国家的代表本着求同存异的原则，从国际社会的全面利益出发，争取早日建立一种新的国际新闻传播秩序。
