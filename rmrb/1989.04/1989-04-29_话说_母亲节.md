Mother's Day has developed into an international holiday in the present day.

The country where Mother's Day first appeared is the United States. On May 9, 1906, the mother of American citizen Anna Jarvis passed away, leaving her in deep sorrow. To perpetually commemorate her mother's love, she proposed that a day be set aside each year as Mother's Day to express gratitude for maternal love. On May 7, 1914, the U.S. Congress passed a resolution designating the second Sunday of May as Mother's Day to honor and thank all mothers. On this day, people traditionally wear a carnation, with those who have lost their mothers wearing a white carnation.

Japan's Mother's Day is also on the second Sunday of May. On this day, people give their mothers a red carnation to show their respect.

France first celebrated Mother's Day in 1928, on the last Sunday of May. On this day, millions of mothers joyfully receive their children's warm wishes of "Happy Mother's Day."

In Thailand, Mother's Day involves a nationwide selection of "Excellent Mothers"; children hold fragrant jasmine flowers and present them to their mothers.

Countries that call it "Mama's Day" include India and the Central African Republic.

In India, on Mama's Day, mothers dress in colorful saris and wear various ornaments, looking elegant.

In the Central African Republic, Mama's Day is on the last Sunday of May. On this day, a celebration ceremony is held in the capital city of Bangui.

　　话说“母亲节”
    仁杰
    母亲节在当今已发展成为一个国际性节日。
    世界上最早出现母亲节的国家是美国。１９０６年５月９日，美国女公民安娜·贾维丝的母亲不幸去世，她悲痛万分。为了永远追思母爱，她倡议每年定一天为母亲节来感谢母爱的伟大。１９１４年５月７日，美国国会通过决议，把每年５月份的第二个星期日定为母亲节，以表示对所有母亲的尊敬和感谢。这一天，人们按习惯佩戴一枝石竹，丧母者则要戴白色石竹。
    日本的母亲节也是５月份的第二个星期日。节日里，人们送给母亲一枝红石竹，以表示敬意。
    法国首次庆祝母亲节是在１９２８年，节日为５月份的最后一个星期日。节日这一天，数以百万计的妈妈，都怀着喜悦心情接受孩子们“节日愉快”的美好祝愿。
    泰国的母亲节，全国要开展“优秀母亲”的评选活动；儿女们手持芳香馥郁的茉莉花，献给自己的母亲。
    称妈妈节的国家有印度、中非共和国等。
    印度的妈妈节，妈妈都穿上五彩缤纷的纱丽，戴上各种首饰，风姿绰约。
    中非共和国的妈妈节是５月的最后一个星期日。这一天，在首都班吉市举行庆祝仪式。
