Tianjin Customs has sent the signed materials carried by Liu Qian Shi and others from Hong Kong to the Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 4 - A reporter from this agency learned today that Tianjin Customs has handed over the signed materials carried by Liu Qian Shi and others from Hong Kong to the Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

The spokesperson for the General Administration of Customs told reporters that on March 28, Tianjin Customs discovered nearly 2,000 copies of printed materials, including "Declaration for Democracy and Human Rights," "Petition," and "Open Letter to the NPC," during the inspection of Liu Qian Shi and others' luggage. According to Article 28 of the "Customs Law of the People's Republic of China" and Article 4 of the "Regulations on the Management of Printed Materials Carried and Mailed by Individuals into and out of the Country," the excess beyond reasonable personal use was decided to be returned out of the country. Tianjin Customs' actions are normal official duties carried out in accordance with the law and are beyond reproach. Subsequently, Liu Qian Shi made requests to Tianjin Customs and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, hoping that the signed materials would be handed over to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. To respect the rights of Hong Kong compatriots who participated in the signing to express their opinions and suggestions to the NPC, the General Administration of Customs agreed and notified Tianjin Customs to hand over the aforementioned signed materials to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. However, the remaining printed materials should still be returned out of the country. The staff of Tianjin Customs carefully sorted out the signed materials scattered among the large number of "Declaration for Democracy and Human Rights" and other printed materials and sent all these signed materials to the Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on April 3.

　　天津海关将刘千石等所携签名材料
    送交全国人大常委会办公厅信访局
    新华社北京４月４日电  本社记者今天获悉，天津海关已将香港刘千石等人携带进境印刷品中的签名材料转送全国人大常委会办公厅信访局。
    海关总署发言人对记者说，３月２８日，天津海关在检查刘千石等人的行李物品时，发现有“争取民主人权声明”、“请愿书”、“致人大公开信”等印刷品近２０００份，并依据《中华人民共和国海关法》第二十八条和《海关对个人携带和邮寄印刷品进出境管理规定》第四条的规定，决定将超出自用合理数量的部分退运出境。天津海关的这种做法是依法执行职务的正常公务活动，是无可非议的。事后，刘千石分别向天津海关和全国人大常委会提出要求，希望将其中的签名材料转送给全国人大常委会。为了尊重参与签名的香港同胞向人大提出意见和建议的权利，海关总署同意并通知天津海关将上述签名材料转交全国人大常委会，但其余印刷品仍应退运出境。天津海关的工作人员将分散夹放在大量“争取民主人权声明”等印刷品的签名材料一一清理出来，并于４月３日将这些签名材料全部送交全国人大常委会办公厅信访局。
