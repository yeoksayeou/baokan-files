A sample survey of the rural healthcare situation in Liping County, our province, revealed the following:

First, medical and healthcare services are tilted towards urban areas, widening the gap between urban and rural areas. Taking Liping County's city center as an example, with a population of less than 20,000, there are 8 medical institutions, including the county hospital, district hospital, and town hospital, accounting for 1/10 of the total medical institutions in the county. There are nearly 150 doctors, accounting for 78.9% of the total number of doctors in the county. Additionally, the medical equipment is good, and there are many beds. The county hospital has special rehabilitation beds for elderly cadres that are often not fully occupied, while some elderly people in rural areas cannot be hospitalized for treatment due to a lack of beds.

Second, rural healthcare institutions have dilapidated buildings, limited working capital, lack of medicine, poor equipment, and a shortage of healthcare technical personnel. According to statistics, out of the 66 township health centers in the county, 18 have dangerous buildings, and 32 operate in borrowed rooms. Among these 66 health centers, only 13 have 1,000 yuan of funds. In recent years, the county has dispatched 16 chief doctors and doctors, while the same period saw only 8 university graduates assigned or transferred in.

Third, there are few village healthcare workers, their quality is poor, and their compensation is low. According to data provided by the county health bureau, on average, each township has only 4.6 healthcare workers, and there is only 0.7 healthcare worker per 1,000 rural residents. Out of the more than 300 township healthcare workers in the county, only 50 have studied at the county health school, while the rest have only received short-term training. Each of them receives a monthly subsidy of only 35 yuan, and 50% of them do not receive it. Many people are not satisfied with their work, some have stopped working, and some have changed jobs.

Fourth, there are more witch doctors than doctors. According to a sample survey by the county health bureau of 17 villages, 11 villages without healthcare organizations account for 64.7%. In the county, 60% of village-level healthcare organizations exist in name only. Rural residents cannot find doctors when they are sick, and witch doctors have emerged in response. In Diping Township alone, there are 21 witch doctors, while there are only 4 healthcare workers and midwives. In the village of Cengkou in this township, with 108 households and 529 people, there are no healthcare workers or midwives, but there are 8 witch doctors.

　　倾斜的“红十字”
    对我省黎平县农村卫生事业现状抽样调查发现：
    一、医疗卫生服务的重点向城市倾斜，拉大了城乡差距。以黎平县城关为例，人口不足两万，却有县医院、区医院、镇医院等８个医疗单位，占全县医疗机构总数的１／１０；有医师近１５０人，占全县医师总数的７８．９％；另外，医疗设备好，床位多。县医院专为老干部开设的康复病床经常住不满，而一些乡村老人有病因没有病床，无法住院治疗。
    二、农村卫生机构用房破旧，流动资金少，药缺、设备差，卫生技术骨干外流。据统计，全县６６个乡镇卫生院用房，属危房的１８个，借房开业的３２个。这６６个卫生院中，只有１０００元经费的１３个。近年来，全县调出主管医师和医师１６人，而同期调入的和分配的大学毕业生只有８人。
    三、乡村卫生人员量少、质差、待遇低。据县卫生局提供的资料，全县平均每乡只有４．６个卫生员，每１０００农村人口只有０．７个卫生员。全县３００多个乡卫生员，除５０人经过县卫校学习外，其余只经过短期培训。他们每人每月只有３５元补贴，其中还有５０％的人得不到，许多人工作不安心，有的歇业，有的改行。
    四、鬼师巫婆多于医师。据县卫生局对１７个村的抽样调查，未设卫生组织的１１个村，占６４．７％。全县６０％的村级卫生组织名存实亡。农村群众有病找不到医生，鬼师巫婆随之应运而生。仅地坪乡就有鬼师巫婆２１人，而这个乡卫生员、接生员只有４名。这个乡的岑扣村１０８户人家，５２９口人，没有一名卫生员和接生员，而鬼师却有８个。
