Iran and Iraq to Resume Talks

	Xinhua News Agency, compiled from Tehran and Baghdad, April 19th — Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz will travel to Geneva today to participate in the fourth round of peace talks scheduled to begin tomorrow.

	Velayati told reporters before leaving Tehran that UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar's recent proposal to fully implement Resolution 598 is significant. He reiterated that Iraq must withdraw from Iranian territory and acknowledge the 1975 agreement between the two countries, which regards the main navigational channel of the Shatt al-Arab as the border between the two nations.

	The three rounds of talks that began five days after the ceasefire last August were suspended due to disagreements between the two sides over key issues such as troop withdrawal, sovereignty over the Shatt al-Arab, and the exchange of prisoners of war.

	During the upcoming talks, Pérez de Cuéllar will meet separately with the foreign ministers of both countries.

	Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, April 19th — The foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq will begin their fourth round of talks here under the auspices of UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar.

	Pérez de Cuéllar said that although the previous three rounds of talks did not achieve significant progress, maintaining the format of talks at the foreign minister level is very important.

　　两伊将重开谈判
    新华社综合德黑兰、巴格达４月１９日电  伊朗外长韦拉亚提和伊拉克副总理兼外长阿齐兹今天前往日内瓦参加定于明天开始的第四轮和平谈判。
    韦拉亚提在离开德黑兰前对记者说，联合国秘书长德奎利亚尔近期要求完全实施５９８号停火协议的倡议是富有积极意义的。他重申了伊拉克必须从伊朗领土撤军并承认两伊１９７５年协议的要求。该协议视阿拉伯河的主航线为两国的分界线。
    在去年８月停火５天就开始的三轮会谈中，由于双方在撤军、阿拉伯河的主权和交换战俘等关键问题上存在分歧，会谈一度中断。
    在即将举行的会谈期间，德奎利亚尔将分别会见两伊外长。
    新华社日内瓦４月１９日电　伊朗和伊拉克两国外长将在联合国秘书长德奎利亚尔的主持下从明天开始在这里举行第４轮会谈。
    德奎利亚尔说，尽管前３轮谈判未能取得重大进展，但保持两伊外长级谈判的形式是非常重要的。
