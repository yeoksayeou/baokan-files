    To promote the development of China's agriculture, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences recently selected 60 outstanding research achievements. The "Zhongmian 12" new variety bred by the Cotton Research Institute has organically coordinated the three traits of disease resistance, yield, and quality that previously had a negative relationship. This achievement has raised the simultaneous improvement of resistance to Fusarium wilt and yield to an international advanced level. The Livestock Research Institute successfully developed a series of early-maturing pea new varieties—Zhongweng 1, 2, 3, and 4. These varieties were bred using sexual hybridization and single-plant mixed selection methods and are one of the promising protein feed resources.

　　农科院评出优秀成果奖
    本报讯  记者何黄彪报道：为了促进我国农业的发展，中国农科院于前不久评选出６０项优秀科研成果奖。棉花所育成的“中棉１２”新品种，把抗病、产量和品质３个存在负关系的性状有机协调起来，使兼抗枯黄萎病性与产量得到同步提高，达到国际先进水平。畜牧所研究成功的早熟豌豆系列新品种——中豌１、２、３和４号，是利用有性杂交，单株加混合选择的方法选育而成的，是具有广阔开拓前景的蛋白质饲料资源之一。
