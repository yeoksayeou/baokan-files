Song Cheng, the commander-in-chief of the National Army of the Democratic Kampuchea, spoke to Xinhua News Agency reporters last night. He said that to ensure Cambodia's future independence, peace, and non-aligned status, three conditions must be met: Vietnam must genuinely withdraw all its troops from Cambodia, a four-party coalition government must be established, and the United Nations peacekeeping forces must supervise the process.

Song Cheng expressed skepticism about Vietnam's promise to withdraw its troops from Cambodia by September this year. However, he also noted that signs of peace are beginning to emerge. He stated that if Vietnam truly withdraws, a transitional government led by Prince Sihanouk must organize and lead the elections. This is because the parliament elected in this process will be responsible for drafting the constitution, which is crucial for determining Cambodia's future system, institutions, and nature. Therefore, it is imperative that Vietnam does not manipulate the elections through the Phnom Penh government, and the Phnom Penh government must be dissolved before the elections.

Song Cheng also shared his views on Cambodia's future. He said that the Democratic Kampuchea side will form a nationalist party and actively participate in the elections. He believes that as long as the elections are free and fair, the Democratic Kampuchea side will secure some seats. He added, "Regardless of whether we obtain seats, we will respect the election results and will not resort to civil war to resolve any potential party disputes."

Song Cheng believes that the future Cambodia should, as advocated by Prince Sihanouk, become a multi-party parliamentary state, practicing free capitalism and not adopting socialism. It should allow the development of individual private enterprises, respect people's rights to freedom of speech, press, assembly, religion, and the right to strike. In foreign policy, it should adopt an open policy and seek extensive international aid.

　　宋成谈柬埔寨局势    
    不相信越南九月撤军     
    和平曙光已隐约显露    
    柬未来不搞社会主义
    新华社柬埔寨西部地区４月２３日电（记者蔡锡梅、杨木、马胜荣）民柬（即红色高棉）国民军总司令宋成昨晚对新华社记者发表谈话说，要保证柬埔寨未来的独立、和平与不结盟地位，必须具备三大条件，即：越南真正从柬全部撤军、成立四方联合政府、接受联合国维持和平部队监督。
    宋成表示，他目前不相信越南会实现今年９月从柬撤军的诺言。但他也认为，和平曙光已隐约显露。他说，如果越南真撤军，必须由西哈努克为首的四方临时政府组织并领导大选。因为这次大选产生的议会将负有制定宪法的重任，对今后柬埔寨的体制、制度和性质，至关重要。因此决不允许越南通过金边政权操纵大选，金边政权必须在大选前解散。
    宋成还谈了对柬埔寨未来的看法。他说，民柬方面将组成民族主义政党，积极参加大选。他相信，只要大选是自由、公正的，民柬方面会得到部分席位。他说：“无论我们能否拥有席位，我们将尊重大选结果，而不采取打内战的办法去解决可能产生的党派争端”。
    宋成认为，未来的柬埔寨应如西哈努克亲王主张的那样，成为多党议会制的国家，实行自由资本主义，不搞社会主义；允许个体私营经济发展；尊重人民言论、出版、结社、宗教信仰、罢工等权利；外交上要执行开放政策，争取广泛的国际援助。
