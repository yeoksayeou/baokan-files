The exchange of notices for the entry into force of the China-Japan Investment Protection Agreement was held last night at the Akasaka Guest House in Tokyo.

Before the exchange of notices, Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru and Premier Li Peng both made speeches, expressing their common hope that the agreement will play an important role in promoting investment between China and Japan and expanding economic exchanges between the two countries.

Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Foreign Minister Uno Sōsuke signed the notices on behalf of their respective governments.

The China-Japan Investment Protection Agreement was signed in Beijing last August during Takeshita's visit to China by Japanese Ambassador to China Nakajima Binshirou and Chinese Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Zheng Tuobin. The Chinese side has completed the legal procedures necessary for the agreement to enter into force, and the Japanese Diet unanimously approved the agreement on the day of Li Peng's visit to Japan on April 12. The China-Japan Investment Protection Agreement will officially enter into force on May 14.
