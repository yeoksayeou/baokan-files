The Venezuelan Foreign Ministry building, known as the Yellow Palace, caught fire yesterday morning, resulting in the destruction of some precious cultural relics.

Yesterday morning around 10 AM, a fire broke out on the second floor of the northwest section of the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry building. The blaze was brought under control nearly an hour later. This building is one of the older structures in Caracas and is a two-story, circular-shaped edifice. It is named the Yellow Palace due to its light yellow exterior. The building houses historical archives of the Caracas government dating back to 1870. Fortunately, yesterday's fire occurred on the upper floor, so the historical archives stored in the basement were not damaged. However, many valuable tapestries, oil paintings, and exquisite furniture in the affected area were destroyed, which is quite regrettable.

The exact cause of the fire is still unclear, but it is believed to have been sparked by an electrical short circuit.

　　委外交部失火殃及文物
    本报加拉加斯４月２２日电  记者朱满庭报道：委内瑞拉外交部——黄宫昨天上午失火，一些珍贵文物被烧毁。
    昨天上午１０点左右，委内瑞拉外交部大楼西北部二楼突然起火。火势在近一个小时后才被控制。这座建筑是加拉加斯的老式建筑之一，是一座环状方形二层楼房，因外部为淡黄色，得名黄宫。其中保存着１８７０年以来加拉加斯政府的历史档案。不过昨天火灾因为发生在楼上，存放在地下室的历史档案没有受损失。但起火处的不少名贵挂毯、油画和精美家具等文物被毁，十分可惜。
    起火原因还不确切，据说是电线起火引起的。
