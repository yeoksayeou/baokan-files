On the night of February 20th, approximately 100 FBI agents and New York City police officers stormed a building in Queens, New York, swiftly arresting 17 suspected drug smugglers. The search results astonished and delighted the police. Hidden in two rooms were 820 pounds of heroin, far exceeding the 50 pounds the police had anticipated. In another room, they also discovered approximately $3 million in cash. Thus, the "White Devil" anti-drug smuggling operation, which cost $1 million and had been tracking the suspects for a year and a half, unexpectedly achieved a resounding success. This was the first time such a large quantity of heroin had been seized in the United States.

The "White Devil" operation began in October 1987. The FBI learned that a Chinese businessman in New York's Chinatown might be a key figure in drug smuggling. This man, named Wu Guoliang, was 71 years old and had previously been a leader of a Chinese organization. Apart from gambling, he had no other criminal record. Nevertheless, the FBI decided to send a Chinese undercover agent to contact Wu, posing as a major drug dealer. As expected, the undercover agent "purchased" 1 pound of high-purity heroin from Wu for $35,000. By this point, the FBI had gathered sufficient evidence. In December 1987, they began full-scale surveillance of Wu.

FBI personnel discovered during wiretapping that Wu's communications with Asia were mostly in Cantonese, frequently mentioning words like "ginseng," "shrimp," and "bundle." The investigators easily deciphered these simple code words: "ginseng" referred to heroin, and "bundle" meant 1.5 pounds.

In March 1988, Wu Guoliang flew to Calgary, Canada, to meet with drug dealers there. In June, he flew to Hong Kong for activities. Investigators coordinated with Canadian and Hong Kong police to jointly monitor Wu's movements. In fact, all involved countries dispatched capable and experienced detectives to participate in the "White Devil" operation.

By the end of January 1989, the operation was nearing its conclusion. The FBI prepared to make their move. At this time, another key figure arrived in Chicago from Hong Kong to make the final arrangements for transporting the heroin. Subsequently, this person went to New York and met with Wu and a Singaporean drug dealer in a hotel in Manhattan. The police managed to eliminate interference and eavesdropped on the entire conversation. This batch of heroin came from the "Golden Triangle" region on the Thailand-Laos border, was shipped through Singapore, and hidden inside 9-inch tires. It was then sea-freighted to Seattle, USA, and transported by train to New Jersey. Finally, it was trucked to New York.

On February 20th, the FBI confirmed the storage location of the heroin. That night, the police launched a lightning-fast raid, catching the 17 drug dealers off guard and arresting them without resistance.

Anti-drug smuggling experts praised the cooperation between the FBI and other countries, calling it a "brilliant strike." Unexpectedly, at the same time the police raided, another group of Colombian drug dealers was also in the same neighborhood. Mistakenly believing the police had discovered their whereabouts, they threw their weapons out the window and surrendered to the bewildered police. This was indeed a stroke of luck.

　　“白色恶魔”落网记
    今年２月２０日夜，大约１００名联邦调查局侦探和纽约地方警察冲进纽约市皇后区的一栋大楼，以迅雷不及掩耳的速度逮捕了住在那里的１７名毒品走私嫌疑犯。搜查的结果使警方大为吃惊，同时又欣喜若狂。藏在两个房间内的海洛因重达８２０磅，远远超过警方预计的５０磅。在另一个房间，还发现了大约３００万美元现金。至此，耗资１００万美元，代号为“白色恶魔”的反毒品走私计划，经过长达１年半之久的追踪，终于出人意料地大获全胜。一次缴获如此之多的海洛因，在美国还是首次。
    “白色恶魔”计划始于１９８７年１０月。联邦调查局获悉，纽约唐人街一名华裔商人可能是毒品走私的关键人物。此人名叫伍国良，现年７１岁，过去是一华人组织的负责人。除了赌博以外没有其它犯罪记录。尽管如此，联邦调查局还是决定派一名华裔暗探，以大毒品贩子身份与伍接触。果然，暗探从伍手中用３５０００美元“买到”１磅高纯度海洛因。至此，联邦调查局掌握了足够的证据。１９８７年１２月开始对伍进行全面监视。
    联邦调查局人员在监听中发现，伍与亚洲地区的通话大部分使用广东话，对话中多次提到“人参”、“虾”、“匹”等字，调查人员毫不费力地破译出这些简单的暗语，如“人参”代表海洛因，“匹”即１．５磅一捆。
    １９８８年３月，伍国良飞往加拿大的卡尔加里，与在那里的毒品贩子会面。６月飞往香港进行活动。调查人员与加拿大及香港警方取得联系，共同监视伍的行动。事实上，所有涉及的国家均派出得力强干的侦探参加了“白色恶魔”计划。
    １９８９年１月底，“计划”接近尾声，联邦调查局准备收网。这时，另一个关键人物由香港来到芝加哥，为运送这批海洛因作最后的安排。随后，此人又到纽约与伍和一名新加坡毒品贩子在曼哈顿的一所旅馆里会面。警方设法排除了干扰，窃听到了他们会谈的全部内容。这批海洛因来自泰老边境的“金三角”地区，取道新加坡，在那里被装进９英寸大小的轮胎中，然后海运到美国西雅图，再由火车运到新泽西州，最后，用卡车运到纽约。
    ２月２０日，联邦调查局最后证实了海洛因的储存处。当天夜里，警方采取了闪电式突袭，使在那里的１７名毒品贩子在毫无准备的情况下束手就擒。
    反毒品走私专家们对联邦调查局与诸国的合作大为赞赏，称此举为“漂亮的一击”。然而，意外的是，在警方突袭的同时，另一伙哥伦比亚毒品贩子也住在同一街区，误以为警方发现了他们的行踪，混乱中，纷纷将武器从窗口扔出来，向困惑不解的警察投降。这真是一石二鸟。
