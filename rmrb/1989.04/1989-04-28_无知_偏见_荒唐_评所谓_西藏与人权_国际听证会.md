Ignorance, Bias, and Absurdity
– A Review of the So-Called “Tibet and Human Rights” International Hearing

On April 20 and 21, a female member of the Green Party and a retired general in West Germany convened an international hearing in Bonn under the name “Tibet and Human Rights.” This hearing, under the guise of concern for “Tibet’s human rights,” openly advocated for Tibetan independence, shouting, “We must exert every effort to make Tibet a member of the international family in the 21st century.” The appearance of such absurd actions and words is truly astonishing.

Originally, if these Western ladies and gentlemen had seriously read a bit of Chinese history, they would not have difficulty reaching the correct conclusion. However, stubbornness, bias, and ignorance combined inevitably produce absurd logic.

At the hearing, there was also a self-righteous American lawyer who, supposedly serving as a legal advisor to the so-called “Tibetan government-in-exile,” actually cited a reason for Tibet’s independence. He said that, according to his understanding, the large star on the Chinese flag represents the Han ethnicity, and the other four small stars represent four other ethnicities, none of which include the Tibetan ethnicity. Therefore, Tibet is not part of China. Such rare ignorance and absurd logic are nothing but a mockery of human intelligence!

If this so-called hearing were merely a farce by a group of ignorant people, one could simply ignore it. However, there were a few individuals at the meeting who openly advocated meddling in China’s Tibet, which cannot but alert people of conscience. Someone actually regretted that other countries did not prevent the People’s Liberation Army from entering Tibet in 1950! Another person even said that the United States did not provide weapons to support the forces seeking “Tibetan independence” in 1962 was a “shame.” These people even incited Western countries to use economic means to “back China into a corner,” to “make China feel pain,” and so on. Enough said, without adding a single word, the true purpose of this hearing is already clear.

Of course, bias cannot cover up the facts. These people absolutely do not represent the stance of the broad Western people who are friendly to the Chinese people. Dr. Viktor, the former West German ambassador to China, pointed out at the meeting that Tibet has always been an inseparable part of Chinese territory. No country in the world recognizes the so-called “Tibetan government-in-exile.” He refuted the lie that the Chinese government carried out a “massacre” in Tibet and advised the West not to judge the Chinese central government’s Tibet policy with their own standards.

Like several recent overseas hearings and seminars on the Tibet issue, some people with ulterior motives at this hearing talked about how Tibet’s human rights have been violated, how its culture and religion have been destroyed, and even sensationalized that “the Tibetan language is about to disappear.” However, they did not mention what system Tibet practiced before 1959, or what human rights the million serfs of the Tibetan people had at that time; they turned a blind eye to the social progress that Tibet has achieved, especially in the past 10 years, which is recognized worldwide. When they had to admit the many roads and modern facilities built in Tibet, they said these were all for the “army occupying Tibet.” If this is not bias, what else could it be?

The so-called “Tibet and Human Rights” international hearing in Bonn can deceive international public opinion as it pleases, but to change the historical and real status of China’s Tibet is a dream that will never be realized.

### 无知·偏见·荒唐——评所谓“西藏与人权”国际听证会

　　无知·偏见·荒唐    
    ——评所谓“西藏与人权”国际听证会
    本报记者  江建国
    ４月２０和２１日，西德一位绿党女议员和一位退役将军在波恩召开了一个名为“西藏与人权”的所谓“超党派国际听证会”。这个听证会打着关心“西藏人权”的旗号，公然宣扬西藏独立，叫嚷“要竭尽一切努力，让西藏在２１世纪成为国际大家庭的一员”。这种荒唐事、荒唐言的出现不能不使人吃惊。
    本来，如果西方的这些女士和先生们稍为严肃地阅读一下中国的历史，是不难得出正确结论的。然而，固执、偏见和无知加在一起，就必然产生出荒谬的逻辑。
    听证会上还有那么一位道貌岸然的美国律师，据说担任着所谓的“西藏流亡政府”的法律顾问，竟然引用了一条西藏应该独立的“根据”。他说，据他了解，中国国旗上的那颗大星代表汉族，其他４颗小星代表着４个其他民族，其中不包括藏族，因此西藏不是中国的一部分。这种少见的无知和荒唐的逻辑岂不是在愚弄人类的智力？！
    如果这个所谓的听证会只是一群无知者的闹剧，本来人们可以不予理睬。然而会上有那么几个人公然主张染指我国西藏，就不能不引起具有良知的人们警惕。有人竟然为其他国家未能在１９５０年阻止中国人民解放军进藏感到“懊悔”！还有人居然说，美国在１９６２年没有以武器去援助要求“西藏独立”的势力是一个“耻辱”。这些人甚至煽动西方国家动用经济手段“把中国逼到墙角上去”，“让中国感到头疼”，等等。够了，毋需再加只言片语，这个听证会的真实目的已昭然若揭。
    当然，偏见掩盖不了事实。这些人绝对代表不了与中国人民友好的西方广大人民的立场。西德前驻华大使维克特博士在会上指出，西藏自古以来就是中国领土不可分割的一部分，世界上没有任何一个国家承认所谓的“西藏流亡政府”。他驳斥了中国政府在西藏实行“大屠杀”的谎言，奉劝西方不要用自己的观念对中国中央政府的西藏政策评头品足。
    同最近海外举行的几次所谓西藏问题听证会、研讨会一样，一些居心叵测的发言人在这个听证会上侈谈什么西藏人权遭到破坏，文化和宗教遭到灭绝，甚至耸人听闻地说什么“藏语已经快要消失了”。然而，他们闭口不提西藏在１９５９年以前实行的是什么制度，藏族百万农奴那时有什么人权；闭眼不看西藏在民主改革后，特别是近１０年来取得的举世公认的社会进步。当他们不得不承认西藏修建的许多公路和现代化设施时，却说什么这些都是为“占领西藏的军队”服务的。这如果不是偏见还能有别的什么解释呢？
    波恩的所谓“西藏与人权”国际听证会可以随心所欲地愚弄国际舆论，但如欲改变中国西藏的历史与现实地位，那是永远无法实现的梦幻。
