	Oil Pipeline Attacked, Colombia's Oil Exports Paralyzed

	People's Daily, Caracas, April 22—The Colombian state-owned oil company announced yesterday that due to an attack by the National Liberation Army on oil facilities, oil exports have been paralyzed, resulting in economic losses of $23 million.

	The National Liberation Army has recently focused on attacking oil industry facilities to pressure the government into nationalizing the oil industry. On Tuesday (April 18), Colombia's main oil pipeline was blown up. This pipeline has a daily oil transport capacity of 220,000 barrels, and it is estimated that it will take until Sunday for the pipeline to resume operation. As a result, Colombia will have to export 1 million barrels less oil.

　　输油管遭受袭击  哥石油出口瘫痪
    本报加拉加斯４月２２日电  哥伦比亚国营石油公司昨天宣布，由于游击队组织民族解放军对石油设施的袭击，石油出口已经瘫痪，经济损失达２３００万美元。
    民族解放军近一时期来一直集中袭击石油工业设施，以此向政府施加压力，要求实行石油国有化。星期二（１８日），哥伦比亚的主要输油管被炸。这条输油干线的日输油能力为２２万桶，估计要到星期天油管才能恢复运行。哥伦比亚因此要少出口１００万桶石油。
