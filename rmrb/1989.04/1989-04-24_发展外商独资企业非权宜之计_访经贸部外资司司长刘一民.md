Solely foreign-owned enterprises are relatively young among the three types of foreign-invested enterprises in China. Their development has been rapid over the past year. By the end of last year, 594 such enterprises had been approved, mainly located in special economic zones. The foreign investors come from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, as well as the United States, Japan, Thailand, Singapore, and other countries. Recently, a reporter visited Liu Yimin, Director of the Foreign Investment Management Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, to discuss how to further develop solely foreign-owned enterprises.

Reporter: In the process of rectifying economic order and improving the economic environment, our national leaders have repeatedly expressed their welcome to foreign investors to establish more solely foreign-owned enterprises in China. Some people have doubts: Is this because of the current shortage of funds in our country, making it a temporary measure?

Liu Yimin: Establishing solely foreign-owned enterprises, like establishing Sino-foreign joint ventures and cooperative enterprises, are all important forms of utilizing foreign capital in China. They are all policies adopted from the perspective of China's overall opening up. After China promulgated the Law on Sino-Foreign Joint Ventures in 1979, the Law on Foreign-Capital Enterprises was promulgated in 1986. This law provides legal protection for the legitimate rights and interests of solely foreign-owned enterprises and serves as a legal basis for their operations within China. It also facilitates the management and supervision of solely foreign-owned enterprises by the Chinese government. This shows that welcoming foreign investors to establish solely foreign-owned enterprises, just like encouraging joint ventures and cooperative enterprises, is our established policy. It is not a temporary measure or a short-term behavior. Of course, given the current financial tightness and some shortages of raw materials, we indeed welcome foreign investors to establish solely foreign-owned enterprises, especially those with "both ends overseas." Because they do not require additional investment and can increase effective supply.

Reporter: Some people think that encouraging foreign investors to establish more solely foreign-owned enterprises means letting the foreigners take all the money, right?

Liu Yimin: Encouraging foreign investors to establish more solely foreign-owned enterprises, of course, should allow them to make profits; otherwise, where would the attraction come from? The profits should be allowed to be made, and the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors are protected by Chinese laws and regulations.

Moreover, it should be noted that establishing solely foreign-owned enterprises is not only beneficial to the investors but also to the development of China's national economy. The establishment of solely foreign-owned enterprises can solve part of the employment problem for Chinese workers. For example, the early solely foreign-owned enterprise Sanyo Electric Machine Co., Ltd. in Shenzhen's Shekou, has expanded from 800 employees to nearly 4,000. Currently, there are 59 solely foreign-owned enterprises in the Shantou Special Economic Zone, accounting for one-third of all foreign-invested enterprises in the zone. In addition to directly employing workers, there are also many enterprises in society serving it. Solely foreign-owned enterprises are beneficial to China in terms of absorbing funds, cultivating talents, and improving management levels. The establishment of solely foreign-owned enterprises also increases China's foreign exchange earnings, such as income tax and business tax; moreover, foreign investors living in China for a long time will pay daily expenses; they also pay wages to workers, and enterprises need to purchase materials in China, all of which will increase China's income.

Reporter: Are there any general requirements for foreign investors establishing solely foreign-owned enterprises in China? Can they establish whatever they want?

Liu Yimin: There are general requirements. The Law on Foreign-Capital Enterprises clearly stipulates that solely foreign-owned enterprises must adopt advanced technology and equipment, or their products must be entirely or mostly exported. The investment aspect of solely foreign-owned enterprises needs to be correctly guided. Currently, it is undoubtedly necessary to align with the rectification and improvement, and to align with the adjustment of the industrial structure. Only in this way can it be beneficial to the development of China's national economy.

Reporter: Foreign investors establishing solely foreign-owned enterprises in China may encounter difficulties and problems due to the lack of Chinese partners. How should these be resolved?

Liu Yimin: Foreign investors are generally unfamiliar with China's economic system and management system. Coupled with the fact that solely foreign-owned enterprises do not have Chinese partners, various difficulties and problems will naturally arise more frequently during the establishment and operation of the factories. To create a good investment environment for foreign investors, local authorities have established institutions to serve foreign-invested enterprises. Many foreign investors have entrusted them with the application for investment and related matters after the establishment and operation of the factories. As the competent authority for foreign-invested enterprises, we also have the responsibility to provide guidance and assistance, but this does not mean interfering with their production and operation plans. Solely foreign-owned enterprises enjoy autonomy in production and operation plans within the scope and scale of operations approved by the Chinese government, without interference from the government, and only need to be filed with the competent authority.

　　发展外商独资企业非权宜之计   
    ——访经贸部外资司司长刘一民
    本报记者  计泓赓
    外商独资企业，在我国三资企业中还比较年轻。去年以来发展较快。截至去年年底，已批准建立５９４家，主要办在经济特区。外商来自港、澳、台地区以及美、日、泰、新加坡等国。最近，记者就如何进一步发展外商独资企业问题，走访了经贸部外资管理司司长刘一民。
    记者：在整顿经济秩序，治理经济环境中，我们国家领导人曾一再表示，欢迎外商来华多办一些独资企业。有人存在这样的疑问：是否因为当前我国资金不足而采取的权宜之计？
    刘一民：兴办外商独资企业，和兴办中外合资企业、合作企业一样，均为我国利用外资的重要形式，都是从我国对外开放全局出发而采取的方针。继１９７９年我国公布了中外合资经营企业法之后，１９８６年又公布了外资企业法。它为保护外商独资企业的合法权益，为外商独资企业在我国境内的经营活动提供了法律依据，也便于我国政府对外商独资企业进行管理和监督。这表明，欢迎外商来华兴办独资企业，和兴办合资、合作企业一样，是我们的既定方针，它不是权宜之计和短期行为。当然，鉴于当前资金紧张和一些原材料短缺，我们确实更欢迎外商来华兴办独资企业，尤其是“两头在外”的企业。因为它无需增加投入，又可增加有效供给。
    记者：有人认为，鼓励外商多办独资企业，岂不是钱都让外商赚去了吗？
    刘一民：鼓励外商多办独资企业，当然要让人有利可图，不然，哪来吸引力？该赚的钱应该让人赚，外商的合法权益是受中国法律、法规保护的。
    另外，也要看到，兴办独资企业不仅仅对投资者有利，对我国国民经济的发展也是有利的。独资企业的兴办，可以解决我国部分工人就业问题。较早在深圳蛇口兴办的外商独资企业三洋电机有限公司，职工已由８００人发展到近４０００人。目前汕头特区外商独资企业已办起５９家，占全区外商直接投资企业的１／３，除了直接招聘职工进企业外，社会上还有一批企业为它服务。外商独资企业对我国吸收资金、培养人才、提高经营管理水平均有好处。外商独资企业的兴办，也增加了我国的外汇收入，如所得税和工商统一税等；还有，外商常年居住我国，要支付日常费用；也支付工人工资，企业需要在中国采购物资，这都会增加我国收入。
    记者：对来华兴办的外商独资企业，有没有总的要求？是不是他们想办什么就办什么？
    刘一民：有总要求。外资企业法明确规定，独资企业必须采用先进的技术和设备，或者产品全部出口或者大部分出口。独资企业的投资方面需要正确引导，当前无疑要与整顿、治理合拍，要与调整产业结构合拍。这样，才能做到有利于我国国民经济的发展。
    记者：外国投资者来华办独资企业，因无中方伙伴，有了困难和问题应该怎样解决？
    刘一民：外国投资者一般对我国的经济体制、管理制度比较生疏，兼以独资企业无中方伙伴，在建厂和开展经营活动中，这样或那样的困难和问题自然会碰到多一点。为给外国投资者创造良好的投资环境，各地已成立了为外商投资企业服务的机构，不少外国投资者已委托他们办理投资的申请以及建厂、投产后的有关事宜。我们作为外资企业的主管部门，也有责任给以指导和帮助，但决不意味着干涉其生产经营计划。外商独资企业在中国政府批准的经营范围和生产规模内，享有生产经营计划的自主权，不受政府干涉，只要报主管部门备案即可。
