Title: The Need for a Multi-Party Cooperation Mindset

During the "Two Sessions," I heard a broadcast where a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) mentioned that a worker at a certain enterprise wanted to join the China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA), and the enterprise's leadership was puzzled, asking, "Why do you want to join the Kuomintang?"

Such examples might be isolated incidents, but they cannot be dismissed as mere jokes. How many Communist Party members, including cadres at various levels, have truly embraced the concept of multi-party cooperation? It's hard to say. Even in terms of language, we often refer to members of democratic parties as "non-party members" or "outsiders." While this might be acceptable in meetings or among Communist Party members only, the problem arises when such terms are used in newspapers, or in speeches by leaders to the masses. Even when referring to democratic party members holding leadership positions in government departments, they are called "non-party democratic figures." Isn't a vice-minister of the Supervision Ministry referred to in this way?

Recently, the *People's Political Consultative Conference Daily* reported that Shanghai's media outlets have changed their habitual references to members of democratic parties and non-party democrats. Instead of "non-party members" or "non-party cadres," they now use "non-CCP members" and "non-CCP cadres." This change has been approved by the United Front Work Department. I think this change is good! Of course, when specifically referring to a member of a democratic party, one should say "member of the ×× party" or "comrade of the ×× party." This is not about nitpicking, but about reflecting the reality of multi-party existence in our country and the equal relationship between the Communist Party and various democratic parties.

An important aspect of political system reform is to uphold and improve the system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party. Communist Party members must not only have the consciousness of being the ruling party, understanding the importance of upholding the party's correct leadership and playing the vanguard role of party members, but also have the concept of multi-party cooperation. This latter point is a new topic for many people and requires propaganda and education, even some enlightenment work, such as how many democratic parties there are in China, what are their characteristics, and what is the difference between the CDNCA and the Kuomintang, etc. It is also very necessary to change some commonly used but inaccurate and imprecise expressions.

### 要有多党合作观念

　　要有多党合作观念
　　钟怀
    “两会”期间听广播，一位政协委员说，某企业有个工人要参加民革，这个企业的领导大惑不解，问：“你怎么要参加国民党？”
    这样的例子也许是个别的，但不能看作一则笑话。在共产党员包括各级干部中，有多少人确立了多党合作观念？很难讲。仅就用语来说，我们经常把民主党派人士称作“非党人士”、“党外人士”。如果是在共产党的会议上或只有共产党员的场合，这样讲尚无不可。问题是在报刊上，在领导干部向群众所作的报告中都这么讲。甚至提到在政府部门担任领导职务的民主党派人士，也说是“党外民主人士”。监察部一位副部长，不就是这样被人称谓的吗？
    最近《人民政协报》报道，上海的传播媒介对民主党派成员、无党派民主人士的习惯称谓作了改动，把“党外人士”、“非党干部”称作“非中共人士”、“非中共干部”。这种改动得到了统战部门的认可。我以为，改得好！当然，如果具体谈到某个民主党派人士，那就应当说“××党人士”、“××党同志”。这不是咬文嚼字，而是体现我国多党存在的现实，体现共产党和各民主党派之间的平等关系。
    进行政治体制改革的一项重要内容，是坚持和完善共产党领导下的多党合作制度。共产党员既要有执政党意识，懂得坚持党的正确领导、发挥党员先锋模范作用的重要，又要有多党合作观念。这后一点，对许多人是新课题，要进行宣传教育，甚至要做些启蒙工作，比如中国有几个民主党派，各有什么特点，民革和国民党有何不同等等。改变一些习以为常但不准确、不严密的提法，也是很有必要的。
