Title: The Most Courageous Person

The "Day of 1.1 Billion People"
Presses down on people, making it hard to stay calm;
Who would have thought that today, one person's death,
Would cause 1.1 billion people to weep aloud.
It is said to be sorrow, but it is also guilt:
1.1 billion people could not keep him alive;
No longer can we see him at meetings,
No longer can we go to remote areas to ask about the suffering of the poor.

A great man
Is not as respected as the most courageous person:
He once faced the cold wind,
Tore down the walls built over many years,
And released the souls shackled in chains.
Now people begin to realize:
Rather than raising a hand to summon a million cheers,
It is better to wear cloth shoes,
And walk warmly into people's hearts.

### 一个最勇敢的人——哭胡耀邦同志

　　一个最勇敢的人   
    ——哭胡耀邦同志
    苏金伞
    “十一亿人口日”
    压得人难以安静；
    想不到今天一个人的死，
    竟使十一亿人痛哭失声。
    说是悲痛也是愧疚：
    十一亿人竟不能使他活下来；
    不能再在会场上看到他，
    不能再到边远地区询问贫苦群众。
    一个伟人
    不如一个最勇敢的人
    更使人尊敬：
    他曾迎着冷风，
    推倒营筑多年的围墙，
    放出披枷带锁的灵魂。
    现在人们方始悟到：
    与其扬手招来百万人欢呼，
    不如穿上布底鞋，
    亲切地走进人心。
