	Commemorative Trees for Graduates
		Shanxi  Hou Xing

		In the thirteen years since its establishment, Shuangqian Tree Middle School in Caishu Gorge, Ying County, Shanxi Province, has had each graduating class plant commemorative trees for their alma mater. This has transformed the once barren, rocky campus into a lush, green haven. The school has been repeatedly honored as an advanced unit for campus greening by the province, prefecture, and county.

		Caishu Gorge Middle School was built in 1975 and is located in a remote mountainous area. To quickly green the campus and beautify the environment, the school committee decided that in addition to completing their mandatory tree-planting and greening tasks, each student in the graduating class would plant three to five commemorative trees. The school also planned tree-planting bases, implementing a system where each class plants a path, greens a ditch, and plants a canal. According to statistics, over the past thirteen years, graduating students have planted a total of 126,000 commemorative trees for their school. Last year, the trees planted by the first graduating class were harvested, and the school used the wood to make 84 sets of desks and chairs.

　　毕业留念树
    山西  侯兴
    山西省应县双钱树乡柴树沟中学，建校十三年来，每届毕业班的学生都为母校植留念树，使昔日乱石滚滚的校园，变得绿树成荫。该校多次被省、地、县评为校园绿化先进单位。
    柴树沟中学是一九七五年新建的，地处偏僻山区。为了尽快绿化校园，美化环境，校委规定：全体师生在完成义务植树和绿化任务的同时，毕业班的学生每人要栽三至五株留念树。并坚持以校规划植树基地，实行每班植一条路、绿一道沟、栽一条渠……据统计，十三年来毕业班的学生共为母校栽“毕业留念树”一点二六万株。去年，第一届毕业生植的留念树采伐后，学校用这些木材做了桌、凳八十四套。
