	By Jiang Yingguang, Reporter of this newspaper

	On April 8, the Chinese Economic Association Federation held an academic seminar on social group issues. The following opinions from the speakers are worth noting.

		First, the role of existing social groups should be correctly evaluated.

	The speakers believe that there are now thousands of various social groups in China, including national, local, and academic social groups. Most of these social groups were established spontaneously under the guidance of the Party's reform and opening-up policy. They spend very little money but do a lot of work. In promoting economic and political system reforms, conducting academic and theoretical research, and promoting social progress, they have played a very good role. This should be sufficiently recognized. The problem lies in the fact that some comrades have insufficient understanding of the work and role of social groups, have a negative attitude towards social groups, see more problems than achievements, and criticize more than encourage and support. This problem must be solved for social groups to develop smoothly.

		Second, the inevitable trend of social group development should be recognized.

	The speakers believe that the rapid rise of social groups in China in a short period is not accidental. It is a necessary product of reform and opening up, commodity economy, and democratic political construction. Reform and opening up will inevitably lead to the diversification of interests and demands, which will drive the development of social groups. People demand multiple channels to express their wishes, and society requires multiple channels to fulfill its missions. Establishing social groups is an important channel to solve various economic and political problems, ensure social progress and stability. The deep significance of establishing social groups lies in the fact that social groups will undertake part of the social functions currently undertaken by the state in the process of participating in democratic politics. The state will gradually transfer some of its functions to social groups. Therefore, the status of social groups will become more and more important, and the development of social groups is an inevitable trend.

		Third, legislation should ensure the healthy and smooth development of social groups.

	The speakers believe that while affirming the good role of social groups, we should also see that there are some problems with social groups at present. The main problem is that some social groups, for various reasons, find it difficult to carry out activities and their role is not fully played. We should not deny the necessity of social groups just because some social groups have this or that problem. The current social groups are not too many. Everyone agrees that how to guarantee citizens' freedom of association, how to give full play to the role of social groups, and how to help social groups carry out normal activities, all depend on legislation. We should formulate the Association Law and the Social Group Law to make the development and activities of social groups have legal basis. However, the legislation of social groups should focus on encouraging and maintaining the development and activities of social groups, not simply on controlling them, and should not adopt a negative attitude.

		Fourth, theoretical research on social groups should be strengthened.

	The speakers believe that to do a good job in the legislation of social groups, we should strengthen the theoretical research on social groups, and clarify in theory the concepts, social status, and role of social groups, the organization and activity rules, rights and obligations of social groups, as well as the policies of the state. At present, research in this area is very insufficient. So far, there is no specialized monograph on this aspect in China, and there are few articles on this aspect in newspapers and periodicals. It is still an unnoticed field. The speakers believe that the issue of social groups in China is a new field that requires a lot of effort to study, involving democracy, science, and cultural enlightenment. They hope that more people will study the issue of social groups. The speakers proposed to jointly hold a well-prepared academic discussion on social groups, prepare to establish an academic research group in this field, and publish an academic journal to introduce relevant social groups and theoretical research results.

　　希望有更多的人研究社会团体问题
    ●什么是社会团体？　
　　●社会团体居何地位？
    ●社会团体的发展趋势怎样？
　　●怎样促进社会团体的健康发展？

    ４月８日，中国经济学团体联合会召开了社会团体问题学术座谈会，与会发言者的以下一些意见值得重视。
    　　　　一、要正确估价现有社会团体的作用。
    发言者认为，我国现在有各种社会团体，包括全国性、地方性的、学术性的社会团体成千上万个。这些社会团体，大多数是在党的改革开放方针指引下自发成立起来的，它们花钱很少，做的工作很多，在推动经济、政治体制改革，开展学术理论研究，促进社会进步方面发挥的作用是很好的，对此应该有足够的估计。这方面的问题是有些同志对社会团体所做的工作，所起的作用认识不足，对社会团体的态度偏于消极，看问题多，看成绩少，求全责备多，鼓励支持少。这个问题不解决，社会团体就不可能获得顺利的发展。
    　　　　二、要看到社会团体发展的必然趋势。
    发言者认为，我国社会团体在短时间内这样蓬勃兴起不是偶然的，这是改革开放、商品经济和民主政治建设发展的必然产物。改革开放必然带来利益的多元化和要求的多元化，引起社会团体的大发展。人民要求有多种渠道去表达自己的愿望，社会要求有多条渠道去完成自己的使命。成立社会团体是解决各种经济政治问题、保证社会进步和安定的一条重要通道。成立社会团体的深远意义还在于，社会团体在参与民主政治的过程中，将承担一部分现在由国家承担的社会职能，国家也将逐步把自己的一部分职能转移给社会团体，因而社会团体的地位将越来越重要，社会团体将有更大的发展是一个必然的趋势。
    　　　　三、要通过立法保证社会团体健康顺利地发展。
    发言者认为，在肯定社会团体起着良好作用的同时，也要看到目前社会团体存在的一些问题，主要是有些社会团体由于种种原因难以开展活动，发挥作用不够。不能因为有些社会团体存在这样那样的问题就否定社会团体的必要，现在的社会团体不是太多了。大家认为，如何保证公民的结社自由，如何发挥社会团体的作用，如何帮助社会团体开展正常的活动，要靠立法。要制定结社法、社会团体法，使社会团体的发展和活动有法可依。但是社会团体的立法应把立足点放在鼓励和维护社会团体的发展和活动上，不应简单地立足于管，不能采取消极的态度。
    　　　　四、要加强社会团体的理论研究。
    发言者认为，搞好社会团体立法，要加强社会团体的理论研究，把社会团体的概念、社会地位和作用，社会团体的组织和活动规则、权利义务以及国家的方针政策等等在理论上搞清楚。目前这方面的研究很不够，至今我国尚没有一本这方面的专门著作，报刊上这方面的文章也很少见，还是一个尚未被人注意的王国。发言者认为，社会团体问题在中国是要用很大力量去研究的新学问，既涉及民主，也涉及科学，也涉及文化启蒙，希望有更多的人来研究社会团体问题。发言者提议，联合召开一次有准备的关于社会团体的学术讨论会，经过筹备成立这方面的学术研究团体，筹办学术刊物，介绍有关的社会团体及理论研究成果。
