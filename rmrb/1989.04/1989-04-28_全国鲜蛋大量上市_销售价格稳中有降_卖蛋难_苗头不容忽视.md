With the arrival of the peak egg-laying season, the supply of fresh eggs nationwide has significantly increased, and market selling prices have remained stable but show a downward trend.

Information from various regions indicates that this year's abundant egg supply is due to the increase in poultry inventory at the end of last year. Shaanxi Province had an initial inventory of over 46 million laying hens this year, an increase of 30% compared to the previous year. According to statistics from the commercial sector, in just the first two months of this year, the national commercial sector's egg procurement volume increased by 2,600 tons compared to the same period last year. Many urban residents no longer worry about the "difficulty of eating eggs," but some farmers are beginning to worry about the "difficulty of selling eggs." Henan Province has over 2.5 million tons of fresh eggs that can be shipped out of the province this year. Excluding the already arranged inter-provincial allocation and reserve tasks, there are still about 1 million tons that need to find other sales channels.

Some economists point out that the "difficulty of selling eggs" trend in some places should not be overlooked. There have been lessons learned in this area, and active regulatory measures should be taken to protect farmers' enthusiasm for developing poultry and egg production. At the same time, attention should be paid to the hidden concerns of feed shortages for poultry production. Due to feed shortages and high prices, farmers find it both "unaffordable" and "unavailable." Some specialized poultry farmers have prematurely culled laying hens, while others have sold breeding chickens and eggs at low prices as meat chickens and edible eggs.

### 全国鲜蛋大量上市  销售价格稳中有降  “卖蛋难”苗头不容忽视

　　全国鲜蛋大量上市  销售价格稳中有降     
    “卖蛋难”苗头不容忽视
    据新华社北京４月２８日电（记者蒲立业、实习生曾继双）随着产蛋旺季的到来，全国各地鲜蛋上市量普遍增加，市场销售价格稳中有降。
    各地传来的信息表明，今年鲜蛋多得利于去年年底家禽存栏的增加。陕西省年初存栏的成鸡４６００多万只，比上年增长３０％。据商业部门统计，仅今年头两个月，全国商业部门的鲜蛋收购量就比去年同期增加２６００吨。许多城里人不再为“吃蛋难”发愁，可一些地方的农民却开始为“卖蛋难”焦虑起来。河南省今年有２．５多万吨鲜蛋可以调往省外，除已安排的省际间调剂和储备任务外，仍有１万吨左右需要另找销路。
    一些经济界人士指出，对一些地方出现的鲜蛋多无力收购的“卖蛋难”苗头不容忽视，这方面曾有过经验教训，应当采取积极的调控措施，以保护农民发展禽蛋生产的积极性。与此同时，还应注意饲料不足给家禽生产带来的隐忧。由于饲料紧缺价高，农民既“吃不消”又“买不到”，有的养禽专业户提前淘汰产蛋母禽，有的把种鸡、种蛋按肉用鸡、食用蛋低价抛售。
