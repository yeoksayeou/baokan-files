	Li Xiannian, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, recently inspected work in Hubei Province. He hoped that all levels of cadres and the masses, under the leadership of the Party and the government, would make new contributions to the development of industrial and agricultural production and the water and electricity sector.

	Li Xiannian arrived in Wuhan on April 9 after inspecting work in Hebei and Henan provinces. He left Wuhan for Beijing on the evening of April 23. Accompanied by Guan Guangfu, Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, he successively inspected work in Wuhan, Xiangfan, and Yichang. He visited the Danjiangkou Water Control Project, the Gezhouba Power Plant, and the Xiling Gorge Chain Ridge Dangerous Section. He also listened to reports on the situation of the Second Automobile Works and the Yangtze River Three Gorges Water Control Project.

	Li Xiannian pointed out that water is one of the world's greatest resources and should be developed as much as possible to benefit the people. Hubei has a lot of water. The main problem is in the Dabie Mountains. He emphasized the need to focus on benefiting the people and doing more for the masses.

	During his visits to Suizhou, Zaoyang, and Xiangyang, Li Xiannian stressed that all levels of cadres must pay high attention to agriculture as the foundation and strive to improve agricultural production.

	Li Xiannian also pointed out that biogas is a very important energy source that can be used for lighting, cooking, and as fertilizer. It should be popularized as soon as possible. He said that if the biogas issue is resolved, afforestation will be stable, and the phenomenon of cutting down trees as soon as they are planted will not occur.

　　李先念在湖北考察工作
    据新华社武汉４月２４日电（《湖北日报》记者秦凯、新华社记者方政军）全国政协主席李先念近日在湖北省考察工作时，希望各级干部、群众在党和政府的领导下，对工农业生产建设和水电事业的发展作出新的贡献。
    李先念是在河北、河南两省考察后，于４月９日到达武汉的，２３日晚离开武汉返京。在中共湖北省委书记关广富陪同下，他先后在武汉、襄樊、宜昌等地考察工作，察看了丹江口水利枢纽工程、葛洲坝电厂、西陵峡链子崖险段，同时听取了二汽和长江三峡水利枢纽工程论证情况的汇报。
    李先念指出，水是世界上最大的财富之一，要多多开发，让老百姓受益。湖北的水多得很。水困难的主要是大别山。要着眼于造福人民，多为群众办好事。
    李先念在途经随州、枣阳、襄阳等地时，要求各级干部一定要高度重视农业这个基础，努力把农业生产搞上去。
    李先念还指出，沼气是一种很重要的动力，可以照明、做饭，又可做肥料，要尽快普及。他说，沼气解决好了，绿化才稳定，前面栽树后面砍的现象也就不会发生。
