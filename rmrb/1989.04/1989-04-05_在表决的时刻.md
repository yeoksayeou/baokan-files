Title: At the Moment of Voting

The Seventh Session of the Second National People's Congress has concluded.

The agenda for this day was to pass various resolutions. Over the course of more than ten days of discussion, reflection, and clashes of differing opinions, representatives had formed various views on the resolutions. There was consensus, but there were also disagreements. They would exercise their sacred power through voting.

According to the views of some Western journalists in the past: this is when the Chinese "parliament" activates the "voting machine" and stamps the "rubber stamp."

The result, however, was unexpected: none of the nine resolutions were passed unanimously. When voting on the resolution to authorize Shenzhen Municipality to formulate economic regulations and rules for the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, 274 votes were against and 805 abstained. Some said this resolution was passed by a "narrow majority," which is unprecedented in the history of the National People's Congress. Taiwan representative Huang Shunxing stood at the microphone before the vote and loudly declared: "If this resolution is passed, it will create chaos in the legal system and undermine the authority of the highest legislative body."

A representative from Zhejiang Province who voted against the resolution said, "The provincial people's congress can pass local regulations, there's no need for the National People's Congress to authorize it. Besides, Shenzhen hasn't even established a people's congress yet, passing this resolution is 'premature.'"

Shenzhen representative Li Hao said, "I fully support the conference's decision on this resolution. Shenzhen is a reform experiment zone, taking the lead in legislation is beneficial for the whole country."

Zhejiang Province representative Du Huiping voted against the Administrative Litigation Law. This director of the Family Planning Commission in Pan'an County said, "If this law is enacted, it will have a significant impact on family planning work." She added, "I'm not saying this law is bad, it's just not the right time, it's not coordinated."

The conference concluded, and representatives walked out of the venue, enthusiastically discussing: the "voting machine" malfunctioned, is this good or bad?

"The era of 'unanimous passage' has ended, China's democratic politics has taken another step forward!"

"If the resolution regarding Shenzhen had been rejected, it might not have been a bad thing!"

"The voting was too rushed, it could have been more deliberate."

"I originally wanted to vote against or abstain, but I was afraid of becoming a target for domestic and foreign journalists, so I went with the flow and voted in favor."

"The method of raising hands to vote is too outdated."

People were discussing and reflecting. But one thing is certain: this conference has written an important chapter in the construction of China's socialist democracy.

　　在表决的时刻
　　本报记者
    全国人大七届二次会议闭幕了。
    这天的议程是通过各项议案。十余天的讨论、思考、各种不同意见的交锋，在代表们的心目中形成了对各项议案的种种看法。有共识，也有异议。他们将通过表决，行使自己神圣的权力。
    按照西方某些新闻界人士过去的观点：这是中国“议会”开动“表决机器”，盖“橡皮图章”的时候。
    结果，出乎人们的意料：９件议案没有一件一致通过。表决关于授权深圳市制定深圳特区经济法规和规章的议案时，反对票达２７４票、弃权票达８０５票。有人说这件议案是以“微弱多数”通过的，这在人大历史上是绝无仅有的。台湾代表黄顺兴在这项议案表决前就站在扩音器前大声疾呼：“这个决议如通过会造成立法制度的混乱，有损最高立法机构的权威。”
    浙江省一位投反对票的代表则认为，地方法规省人大就可以通过，用不着全国人大授权，再说深圳还没有成立人大，通过这个议案是“超前了”。
    深圳代表李灏说：“对会议作出这个决议，我是很赞同的。深圳是改革的试验区，在立法上先走一步，这种探索对全国来说是有益的。”
    浙江省代表杜惠萍对行政诉讼法投了反对票。这位磐安县计生委主任说：“这个法律如出台，对计划生育工作影响较大。”她又说：“我不是说这个法不好，是没到时候，不配套。”
    大会闭幕，代表们走出会场，热烈地议论着：“表决机器”失灵了，喜耶？忧耶？
    “‘一致通过’的时代结束了，中国的民主政治又前进了一步！”
    “如果关于深圳的议案被否决，未尝不是好事！”
    “表决太匆忙了，还可更从容些。”
    “我本来想投反对票或弃权票，但怕自己成为中外记者注意的目标，还是随大流举手投了赞成票。”
    “举手表决的方式太落后了。”
    人们在议论、思考着。但有一点是可以确定的：这次大会在中国的社会主义民主建设上写下了重要一页。
