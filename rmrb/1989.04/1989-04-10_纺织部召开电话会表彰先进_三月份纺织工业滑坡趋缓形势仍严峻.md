The Ministry of Textile Industry held a telephone conference to commend 744 national textile industry labor models and 79 advanced teams. On April 9, Wu Wenying, Minister of the Ministry of Textile Industry, hoped that the 8 million textile workers across the country would rally their spirits, work hard, and strive to increase the effective supply of textile products.

Using a telephone conference to commend labor models received the support of the State Council leaders. Vice Premier Tian Jiyun and Secretary-General Luo Gan attended the commendation meeting and presented certificates of honor to the labor model representatives.

Wu Wenying called on the masses of workers to extensively and deeply carry out the "double increase and double saving" campaign, which includes improving product grades, increasing processing depth, improving product quality, optimizing product structure, tapping internal potential, and reducing raw material consumption.

Meanwhile, after the national textile industry production experienced negative growth in January and February this year, the production decline in March eased, making the total textile industry output value for the first quarter of this year 1.32% higher than the same period last year.

Although the production decline was reversed in March, the output of major products such as cotton cloth, dyed cloth, and silk remained negative. Major textile bases with a monthly output value of over 100 million yuan, such as Shanghai, Jiangsu, Tianjin, and Zhejiang, still experienced negative growth.

Vice Minister Wang Zengjie pointed out that the main reasons for the decline in textile industry production, apart from the tightness of funds and electricity, are the shortage of raw materials and the inverted prices of raw materials and products.

Wang Zengjie said that to overcome the above difficulties, first, we must actively adjust the raw material structure, vigorously develop polyester imitation products, and develop products containing ramie and rabbit fur. Second, we must adjust the product structure, make the best use of limited raw materials, and increase the added value of each ton of fiber. We must strive for the lightweight use of raw materials and try to increase the average count of cotton yarn by 2 counts, which can save 400,000 piculs of cotton nationwide.

　　纺织部召开电话会表彰先进
    三月份纺织工业滑坡趋缓形势仍严峻
    本报讯  记者莫新元报道：全国纺织工业的７４４名劳动模范和７９个先进班组在电话中受到表彰。纺织工业部部长吴文英９日在纺织工业动员表彰电话会议上希望全国８００万纺织职工振奋精神，艰苦奋斗，为增加纺织品有效供给而努力。
    用电话会议的形式表彰劳模，得到了国务院领导的支持。国务院副总理田纪云、秘书长罗干出席了表彰会，并向劳模代表颁发了荣誉证书。
    吴文英要求广大职工广泛深入地开展以提高产品档次、提高加工深度、提高产品质量、优化产品结构、挖掘内部潜力、降低原材料消耗为内容的“双增双节活动”。
    又讯　继今年１、２月份全国纺织工业生产出现负增长之后，３月份纺织工业生产滑坡趋缓，从而使今年一季度全国纺织工业产值比去年同期增长１．３２％。
    ３月份虽然扭转了生产负增长，但是棉布、印染布、丝绸等主要产品的产量仍是负增长；月产值１０亿元以上的主要纺织基地如上海、江苏、天津、浙江等省市生产仍是负增长。
    王曾敬副部长指出，导致纺织工业生产滑坡的原因除了资金、电力紧张外，主要是原材料短缺和原材料、产品价格倒挂。
    王曾敬说，克服上述困难，首先，要积极调整原材料结构，大力发展涤纶仿真产品，开发含苎麻织物和兔毛织物。其次，要调整产品结构，利用有限的原材料，提高每吨纤维的附加值。要力求原料使用轻量化，努力把棉纱的平均纱支提高２支，这样全国可节省棉花４００万担。
