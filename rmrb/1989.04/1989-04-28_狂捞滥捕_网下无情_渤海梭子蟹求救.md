Title: Overfishing and Destructive Fishing Methods: A Call to Save the Horseshoe Crabs of the Bohai Sea

April is usually the season when horseshoe crabs are abundant in the Bohai Sea, but this year, there has been no significant crabbing season. The horseshoe crab, the last major seafood resource in the Bohai Sea, has now disappeared, following the fate of other species like the yellow croaker, black bass, and yellowfin tuna.

The primary reason for the depletion of horseshoe crab resources is the excessive and destructive fishing methods employed in recent years. In 1986, some fishermen, while harvesting razor clams, also dug up horseshoe crabs that were hibernating. These crabs were sold at high prices in the market, leading a few fishing boats to secretly engage in this practice. By this spring, the number of fishing boats involved had grown to hundreds, if not thousands, all equipped with iron rakes, scouring the hibernation grounds of the crabs.

This predatory fishing method seriously violates natural laws and disrupts the ecological balance. Horseshoe crabs in the Bohai Sea hibernate in the mud and sand from winter to early spring, lay eggs in May, and return to the deep sea in autumn to hibernate again. However, since the introduction of this destructive fishing method, horseshoe crabs are being taken during their hibernation. Many crabs flee in panic but ultimately die in the cold sea due to insufficient sleep. Those that survive have significantly reduced reproductive capabilities. Consequently, the crab population is declining yearly, and the catch is decreasing. The Tianjin Municipal Fisheries Bureau's Donggu Fisheries Trading Department used to purchase 1,200 to 1,300 tons of horseshoe crabs each April and May. This year, as of now, they have only purchased less than 20 tons.

The declining crab population has led to a continuous increase in prices. The rising number of fishermen and fishing boats is another reason for the depletion of horseshoe crab resources. Previously, horseshoe crabs were priced at 0.40 yuan per kilogram, but now they are priced at 14 yuan per kilogram. Although fishermen are aware that this fishing method is unsustainable, they cannot resist the temptation of money. In 1980, Zhanghe County in Liaoning Province had 906 motorized boats with a total power of 19,964 horsepower. By 1988, this had increased to 2,137 boats with 46,148 horsepower.

To control this situation and prevent the extinction of horseshoe crab resources, the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Fisheries issued a directive in 1987 prohibiting the fishing of horseshoe crabs and razor clams in certain areas of the Bohai Sea during their hibernation period. However, this directive has been poorly enforced. The Bohai Sea, once renowned for its abundant resources, has seen the disappearance of species like the yellow croaker, black bass, yellowfin tuna, and mackerel. We hope that relevant departments will take timely and effective measures to save the horseshoe crabs.

### 狂捞滥捕　网下无情  渤海梭子蟹求救

　　狂捞滥捕　网下无情    
    渤海梭子蟹求救
    ４月，本应是渤海湾梭子蟹大量上市的季节，然而今年的４月，渤海湾的梭子蟹却根本没有形成蟹汛。梭子蟹——渤海湾最后的一种大宗海鲜资源，也像带鱼、黄花鱼、鲈鱼一样又不复存在了。
    梭子蟹资源枯竭的主要原因是近几年渔民狂捕滥捞。１９８６年，有的渔民在扒捕魁蚶时，将正在冬眠的梭子蟹也扒了上来，在市场上卖了好价钱，于是有少数的渔船偷着干，今春却已发展到成百上千的渔船，拖着铁耙，在海蟹冬眠场上来回梳篦。
    这种掠夺性的捕捞方法严重违背了自然规律，破坏了生态平衡。渤海海蟹每年冬季至初春都要在渤海中部的泥沙中冬眠，５月产卵繁殖，秋季带着子蟹游回深海冬眠。而扒捕方法“发明”以后，梭子蟹在冬眠时就被掠走，还有相当一部分海蟹落荒而逃，但终因海水寒凉睡眠不足惨死海中，侥幸活下来的，生育能力也受到严重影响。因此，海蟹资源逐年减少，产量逐年下降。天津市水产局东沽水产购销经营部１９８６年以前，每年４、５月份要收购１２００—１３００多吨，今年截至目前还不到２０吨。
    海蟹产量连年递减，导致价格连年激增。而渔民的激增，渔船数的激增，也是梭子蟹资源枯竭的原因之一。以前，梭子蟹的价格是每公斤０．４０元，现在是１４元。渔民们虽然深知这种捕捞方法是吃子孙饭，但仍禁不住金钱的诱惑。辽宁省庄河县１９８０年有机动船９０６条，共１９９６４马力，１９８８年发展到２１３７条，４６１４８马力。
    为了控制这种局面，防止梭子蟹资源的灭绝，农牧渔业部曾经于１９８７年发文件规定，每年梭子蟹冬眠期间，禁止在渤海湾中部部分渔区捕捞梭子蟹和魁蚶，然而，此文的执行极为不力。曾以资源丰富著称的渤海湾，原先盛产的带鱼、黄花鱼、鲈鱼、鲙鱼、鲳鱼、梭鱼均已绝迹，希望有关部门及时采取有力措施，拯救梭子蟹。《今晚报》记者　顾建新　于国峻
