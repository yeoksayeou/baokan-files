Title: Ballet Has Its Own Aesthetic Characteristics, "Nationalizing Ballet" Is Not Advisable

Following the performances of "The Butterfly Lovers" and "The Dream of the Red Chamber," the Central Ballet of China once again presented the new work "Yang Guifei" to the audience in the capital. Using ballet to depict Chinese real-life scenarios is already a challenging task, and using it to depict ancient Chinese life is even more complex. Setting aside the vast differences between the inherent Chinese ethics, customs, and upbringing of Chinese royalty, nobles, and scholars and the original content of ballet, even the external presentation of Chinese attire—with its long robes, jade belts, silk brocades, and completely enclosed design—has a significant gap with the ballet's form of dance, which emphasizes soaring, spinning, lightness, and the expressive power of the body. Designing costumes that adhere to ballet characteristics would not only invite criticism for not being Chinese (especially not ancient Chinese) but would also face accusations of being indecent. Designing according to the patterns of life or traditional opera costumes, however, would make dancing impossible, effectively canceling out the possibility of creating a ballet based on ancient Chinese themes. A few years ago, someone took a compromise approach: the "men" in the ballet still wore long robes, but with large openings on both sides, forming front and back pieces that covered the thighs. However, this not only weakened the beauty of the movements but also made them look even more awkward. The costume design for "Yang Guifei" uses a bold, freehand style, eliminating the previous flaws, and looks both Chinese and balletic, undoubtedly loosening the constraints on creating Chinese ballet dramas. The audience seems to have shown the appropriate respect and understanding, no longer voicing too many criticisms.

Ballet has its own inherent dynamic system, organizational methods, and expressive forms, giving it a unique aesthetic that other dance forms cannot replace, especially traditional ballet. When using it to create works based on Chinese themes, it is inevitable to incorporate dance forms rich in Chinese flavor, but they must not deviate too far from ballet characteristics. Introducing highly distinctive actions from Chinese classical dance (such as flips, diving, and crouching steps) may feel forced and may not be a wise approach. This easily confuses the boundaries between ballet and Chinese classical dance, blurring their respective aesthetic characteristics, and prevents the audience from fully experiencing the different aesthetic sensations that different dance forms should possess. In recent years, Chinese classical dance has become increasingly balletic. If ballet also becomes increasingly Chinese classical, I am concerned that, apart from pointe shoes, they may end up on the same path. "Yang Guifei" is better than previous ballets, but there is still a need for vigilance.

This once again raises my long-standing doubts about the "Chinese-ization" or "nationalization" of ballet—how scientific is this effort? Taking "Yang Guifei" as an example, its choreography basically follows the creation paradigm of classical ballet, but it fails to fully showcase the enchanting artistic style of classical ballet. The overall ballet lacks standardization and completeness, and the intended balletic aesthetic is weakened. The root of this problem may not lie in the choreographer's skills but in the disruptive influence of the "Chinese-ization of ballet" mindset: the creator fears that it might be too balletic and not "Chinese," so they have to fill the work with some actions from Chinese classical dance on one hand, while on the other hand, they strive to avoid or even sacrifice the characteristics and methods that belong to ballet. This is regrettable. It is easy to imagine that the audience wants to watch ballet because they have special expectations for ballet aesthetics, not for anything else.

    继《梁山伯与祝英台》、《林黛玉》等剧目之后，中央芭蕾舞团又向首都观众献上了新作《杨贵妃》。用芭蕾舞表现中国的现实生活已非易事，用其表现中国古代生活尤显复杂得多。且不说受着中国固有的纲常、伦理风习、教化教养出来的中国王公贵妃、佳人才子们与芭蕾舞原有的内涵相距多么遥远，单说那表现在外的莽袍玉带披罗挂锦、完全封闭式的中国服饰，与芭蕾舞那腾飞旋转、轻盈细腻并十分注重形体表现力的舞蹈形式之间就有很大的距离。遵循芭蕾特征设计服装，不但会招来不是中国人（尤其不是古代中国人）的非议，还要遭到有伤风化的指责；按照生活或戏曲服装模式设计，又舞蹈不起来，等于是取消芭蕾编演中国古代题材舞剧的可能性。前几年有人采取折衷的办法：舞剧中的“男士”仍穿长袍，将长袍两侧大开口，形成遮盖大腿的前后两片。但舞蹈起来不仅削弱了动作的美感，且愈发显得不伦不类。《杨贵妃》的服装设计运用大写意的手法，革除了前此以往的弊端，看起来既是中国的，又是芭蕾的，无疑是为创造中国芭蕾舞剧松了一次绑。观众对此似乎也表现出应有的尊重和理解，而不再过多地发出非难之声了。
    芭蕾舞有它固有的动态系统、组织方式和表意形式，因而它具有其它舞种不能取代的美感，传统芭蕾尤其如此。用其编演中国题材的时候，不可避免地要充实进富有中国情调的舞蹈形态，但必须与芭蕾特征不相去太远。若将中国古典舞中个性很强的动作（诸如翻身、探海、躜步等动作）放进去，让人感到生硬，未必是一种明智的办法。这很容易混淆芭蕾舞与中国古典舞的界限，模糊了它们各自的美学特征，不能令人尽情体验不同舞种本应具有的审美感受。近年来中国古典舞越来越芭蕾化，如果芭蕾也越来越中国古典化，我担心除了还有足尖鞋的区分外，它们很可能要走到一条路上去。《杨贵妃》较前几部舞剧显得好些，但仍有警觉的必要。
    从中再一次引动我对于“芭蕾舞中国化”或“芭蕾舞民族化”长期存在于心的质疑——这种努力的科学性到底有多少？拿《杨贵妃》来说，它的编排方法基本上遵循着古典芭蕾的创作范式，但却未能尽兴地展现出古典芭蕾那种令人神往的艺术风采，在舞剧总体上显得不够规范与完整，应有的芭蕾美感也受到了削弱。这类问题的症结恐怕不在于作者的编舞功力，而在于“芭蕾舞中国化”这种意识所起的干扰作用：作者生怕太像芭蕾而不“中国化”，便不得不一方面往作品里填充中国古典舞的某些动作，一方面又极力回避乃至牺牲本属芭蕾舞的特征和手段。这是令人遗憾的。可以想象，观众所以要看芭蕾，肯定是由于对芭蕾美学怀有特殊的期望而不是其它。
