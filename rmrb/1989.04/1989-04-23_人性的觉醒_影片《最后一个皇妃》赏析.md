The Awakening of Humanity

A Review of the Film "The Last Empress"

Undoubtedly, the spotlight of the new Changchun Film Studio production "The Last Empress" is focused on Li Yujin. However, for the vast audience who have already seen films and television series such as "The Last Emperor" and "The Last Empress," this story may not evoke much novelty. Within this almost universally known historical framework, what can the film's creators (screenwriter Zhang Xiaotian and director Sun Sha) achieve? Can they find a unique perspective to give the film a fresh twist? I believe this question is well addressed in the film's conclusion, which is the reunion and separation of Li Yujin and Puyi in the Fushun War Criminals Management Center.

Li Yujin, the former imperial consort, wearing a simple Lenin suit and braided hair, walks into the prison walls to visit Puyi. Li Yujin's feelings are complex and contradictory. She was born into a commoner's family. Ten years ago, at the age of 15, she entered the palace, merely a temporary measure for Puyi to escape the trap set by the Japanese military (who wanted him to marry a Japanese woman). During the two years she spent with Puyi, she had given comfort to the "child emperor," who was anxious and frightened, with her girlish innocence and devotion. However, in Puyi's heart, she was insignificant, to the extent that when "disaster struck," Puyi abandoned her and fled. In the following eight years, Li Yujin matured through hardship and exile, transforming from a naive girl into a woman with a vague sense of "taking control of her own destiny." Yet, she could not completely shake off the shackles of traditional moral values, nor could she forget her marital bond with Puyi and the promise she had made to him: "As long as there is one person by your side, that person will be me." Her pure and kind heart could not help but worry about Puyi's current situation and future. She had been longing to see Puyi again for eight years, though she was unsure whether this reunion would bring them together or drive them apart.

And so, they met in prison. Puyi was both ashamed and happy, while Li Yujin was overwhelmed with memories and emotions. Her feelings for Puyi had almost dried up. With the permission of the management center, Li Yujin stayed the night, the first time in ten years that Puyi had spent a night with Li Yujin as husband and wife. She cried for this, tears silently flowing. If this had happened ten years ago when she was just blossoming into womanhood, she might have felt lucky and satisfied, but now she felt only emptiness and confusion. The next day, the scene where Puyi returns to the guesthouse is truly brilliant! He walks over enthusiastically and says to Li Yujin, "Today, we got some candy!" He takes out a handful of fruit candies from his pocket, carefully picks out one and places it on the table in front of Li Yujin, putting the rest back into his pocket. Li Yujin is stunned. She immediately picks up her own bag, and "whoosh!" a bag full of candies is poured onto the table. I was moved by all this! Puyi's action and mindset, of course, were naturally and unconsciously revealed, but isn't this still a reenactment of his past behavior as an emperor, looking down on Li Yujin with "benevolence"? Following this, Puyi asks Li Yujin to "stay with him for life," and Li Yujin refuses. She says, "Do you think I came all this way just to sleep with a man?" This is a question for both Puyi and herself.

Indeed, she obtained what she once hoped for—sexual intimacy (which is naturally a part of human nature); but it is at this moment that she finally realizes: this is not what she truly needs. As a person, what is more precious and desirable is to live a life of freedom, equality, and human dignity. Thus, she parted ways with Puyi, walking out of the symbolic high walls to seek the new life she yearns for.

This conclusion is an elevation, becoming a brilliant stroke in the film's revelation of human awakening.

There is another interpretation of this conclusion: "The former imperial consort, under political and living pressures, had no choice but to leave Puyi." This falls into the tragic mold of lovers not being able to unite. I do not see it this way.

　　人性的觉醒    
    ——影片《最后一个皇妃》赏析
    钟艺兵
    毫无疑问，长影新片《最后一个皇妃》的聚光灯是投射在李玉琴身上的；但是对于已经看过《末代皇帝》、《末代皇后》等影视作品的广大观众来说，这一段故事很难再引起他们的新鲜感了。在这样一个几乎家喻户晓的历史框架中，影片的编导者（编剧张笑天，导演孙沙）能有多大作为呢？他们能找到一个独特的视角，给影片以新意么？我看，这个问题在影片的结尾处获得了较好的解决，这就是李玉琴在抚顺战犯管理所同溥仪的重逢和离异。
    昔日的皇妃——福贵人李玉琴，梳着双辫，穿了一身朴素的列宁装，走进监狱的高墙，探望溥仪来了。李玉琴的心情是复杂而又矛盾的。她生在一个平民家庭。１０年前，她１５岁时进宫，只不过是溥仪为逃避日本军部的圈套（要他与日本女子结亲）的一项权宜之计。在同溥仪相处的两年中，她曾以少女的天真和痴情给予做“儿皇帝”、心情惶恐不安的溥仪以慰藉；但在溥仪的心中，她是无足轻重的，以至在“大难临头”时，溥仪便扔下她而逃之夭夭。此后的８年，李玉琴在颠沛流离的困苦生活中成熟起来，从一个幼稚的少女变成了一个具有“自己掌握自己的命运”朦胧意识的女性。但她又不可能完全摆脱传统道德观念的束缚，也难以忘却她与溥仪的夫妻情份和她曾经对溥仪许下的诺言：“只要还有一个人跟在你的身边，那一个人就是我。”她那颗纯朴、善良的心，更不能不为溥仪的现状和未来而记挂。她盼望再次见到溥仪已盼了８年，尽管这种重逢给他们之间带来的后果是团圆还是离异，她自己也未必猜得透。
    于是，他们在狱中相见了。溥仪愧喜交加，李玉琴则往事如烟，感慨万端，她对于溥仪的情感之河已接近枯竭。在管理所的特许下，李玉琴留住一夜，这是溥仪１０年来第一次同李玉琴过的夫妻生活。她为此而哭了，泪水默默地流淌着。这件事如果发生在她情窦初开的１０年前，她或许会感到幸运、满足，但如今感到的却是一片失落和茫然。第二天，溥仪回到招待所时的那段戏，可谓绝妙！他兴致勃勃地走来，对李玉琴说：“今天我们发糖了！”从衣袋里掏出一把水果糖，认真地挑出其中的一块放在李玉琴面前的桌子上，剩下的糖果又统统放回到衣袋里去了。李玉琴为之一愣。她立刻提起自己带来的挎包，“哗！”一袋子糖果都倒在了桌上。我被这一切震动了！溥仪的这一个动作、心态，当然是在不自觉中自然而然地流露出来的，但岂不还是他当皇上时居高临下地对李玉琴进行“恩赐”的再一次重现么？接下来，便是溥仪要求李玉琴“终身相守”于他，便是李玉琴的拒绝。她说：“你以为，我从那么远的地方到这里来，就是为了和男人睡上一觉？”这既是问溥仪的，也是问自己的。
    不错，她得到了她曾经希望得到的两性生活（这自然也是人性要求的一部分）；但正是在此时，她也最终明白了：这不是她最需要得到的。作为一个人，更珍贵、更向往的是要过上一种自由、平等、具有人的尊严的生活。于是，她与溥仪分手了，她走出了那面多少带有一点象征意味的高墙，去寻求她所憧憬的新的生活。
    这结尾是一种升华，它成了这部影片揭示人性的觉醒的精采的一笔。
    对于这一结尾的理解，也存在着另一种意见，这就是：“昔日的皇妃迫于政治上和生活上的压力，只好离溥仪而去。”这便进了有情人终不成眷属的悲剧套子。我是不这么看的。
