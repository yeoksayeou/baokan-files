Nationwide Implementation of New Driver's Licenses

    Starting from July 1st of this year, the new People's Republic of China Motor Vehicle Driver's License will be uniformly implemented across the nation.

    It is reported that the new driver's license will be divided into four types: driver's license, probationary driver's license, learner's driver's license, and temporary driver's license. The latter three types of driver's licenses are only valid within the country.

    The Ministry of Public Security recently issued a notice, detailing the qualifications and scope of use for the four types of driver's licenses.

    The notice stipulates that the issuance of old driver's licenses will be stopped nationwide starting from October 1, 1989.
