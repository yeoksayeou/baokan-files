Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 18th. — The General Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Husák, stated today that Czechoslovakia will not reevaluate the 1968 events.

He said at a press conference held here that the Czechoslovak Communist Party will not restore the political reputation of its former leader, Dubček, because Dubček made mistakes during the 1968 events.

Husák emphasized that the 1968 Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia cannot be compared with the 1979 Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.

Husák arrived in the Soviet Union yesterday for a working visit. This morning, he held talks with Soviet leader Gorbachev.

Husák said that he and Gorbachev exchanged information on the reform and democratization processes in both countries, discussed new forms of developing bilateral economic and trade relations, and exchanged views on some important international issues. He believes that his views are consistent with those of Gorbachev.

Husák said that Czechoslovakia has several parties, but there are no opposition parties. The Czechoslovak Communist Party is implementing a policy of socialist pluralism, strengthening the role of other parties and organizations, and enabling them to participate more in state affairs and assume more responsibilities.

　　捷共中央总书记雅克什表示
　　捷不重新评价六八年事件
    新华社莫斯科４月１８日电　（记者王宪举）捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央总书记雅克什今天说，捷克斯洛伐克不重新评价１９６８年事件。
    他在这里举行的记者招待会上说，捷克斯洛伐克共产党不给党的前领导人杜布切克恢复政治名誉，因为杜布切克在１９６８年事件中犯有错误。
    雅克什强调说，不能把１９６８年苏联出兵捷克斯洛伐克与１９７９年苏联出兵阿富汗相提并论。
    雅克什是昨天来苏联进行工作访问的。今天上午他与苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫举行了会谈。
    雅克什说，他与戈尔巴乔夫互相介绍了两国改革和民主化进程的情况，讨论了发展两国经济、贸易等双边关系的新形式，并就当前一些重要国际问题交换了意见。他认为，他同戈尔巴乔夫的观点是一致的。
    雅克什说，捷克斯洛伐克有几个政党，但是不存在反对党。捷克斯洛伐克共产党实行社会主义多元化方针，正在加强其他党和组织的作用，使它们更多地参与国家事务，承担更多的责任。
