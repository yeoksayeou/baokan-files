Title: Reform is Needed in Eating Habits

The culture of eating in China has a long tradition. Over two thousand years ago, Confucius emphasized "food should not be too coarse, and minced meat should not be too rough," and "if the cutting is not straight, do not eat; if the sauce is not right, do not eat." This means that food should be finely prepared, and if the knife work is poor or the seasoning is bad, it should not be eaten. By now, Chinese cuisine has reached a level of exquisite refinement, with some dishes being as beautiful as art. Chinese restaurants are found all over the world, truly earning global acclaim.

However, I believe that while many Chinese people are very particular about food, they also do not know how to eat properly.

In terms of the variety of dishes, the sophistication of cooking techniques, the richness of flavors, and the aesthetic presentation, Chinese cuisine is indeed meticulous. However, when it comes to eating scientifically, reasonably, moderately, and in a way that is both delicious and does not burden the stomach, many people are not particular at all.

Especially during banquets and feasts, hosts only care about the spectacle, and guests only care about indulging in the food. The principle of scientific eating has long been forgotten.

This behavior of overeating is not advanced but backward; not high-level but low-level; not civilized but barbaric. However, due to the current system where such behavior can be reimbursed with public funds, it has become increasingly prevalent and is difficult to stop. Who knows how many resources and labor have been wasted on this backward behavior? Also, who knows how many medications and healthcare workers' efforts have been consumed by the gastrointestinal diseases caused by this behavior?

Nowadays, many people frequently refer to Western practices, but in the realm of eating culture, they are unwilling to learn from the West.

A wealth of experience shows that scientific eating habits and appropriate joint and muscle exercises can prevent aging and maintain youthfulness. Our eating habits and banquet styles indeed need to be scientified.

I hope that in the realm of eating, we can introduce some Western culture. Banquets should not emphasize spectacle or pursue luxury. In families, we should promote measuring rice before cooking and eating in portions.

Currently, reforms are being discussed in all areas. Can we also bring about some reform in our eating habits?

### 吃也要改革

　　吃也要改革
　　吴方
    吃的文化，在中国确乎已有悠久的传统。早在两千多年前，孔夫子就讲究“食不厌精，脍不厌细”，“割不正不食，不得其酱不食”。这就是说，不仅不精不细的不吃，而且刀工不好，调味品不佳的也不吃。到了现在，中国菜的烹调技术更是精益求精，有的菜美化得简直成了工艺品。中国餐馆遍于全世界，真可以说是誉满全球。
    但是，我却以为，中国的许多人一方面是最讲究吃；一方面又最不会吃。
    若论菜肴品种之繁多，烹调技术之精湛，口味之丰富，外形之美观，的确是讲究到家了；但是，要讲如何吃得科学，吃得合理，吃得适度，吃得既美味适口，又不增加肠胃负担，许多人就很不讲究了。
    特别是在酒食交往当中，大吃大喝之际，主人但求排场，客人只贪口福，对于科学进食这一条，早已抛到九霄云外去了。
    这种大吃大喝的行为，不是先进，而是落后；不是高级，而是低级；不是文明，而是野蛮。但是这种落后行为，由于现行制度下能用公款报销而愈演愈烈，并且屡禁不止。不知有多少物资和劳动被浪费在这种落后行为之中；也不知有多少药品和医护人员的辛勤劳动在这种落后行为所造成的肠胃疾病中被消耗掉。
    现在有许多人言必称西方，但在吃的文化方面，却不肯吸收西方的长处。
    大量经验表明：科学的饮食和适当的关节、肌肉运动可以防止衰老，永葆青春。我国人在吃的习惯和宴客的作风方面确有科学化的必要。
    我希望在吃的方面应该引进点西方文化。举行宴会不要讲究排场，追求奢侈。在家庭中提倡量米下锅，分份吃饭。
    现在各方面都在讲改革。能否在吃的方面，也来点改革呢？
