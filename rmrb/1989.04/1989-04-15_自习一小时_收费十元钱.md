On March 7th, Xuguan Middle School in Xiaogan decided that all 300-plus students in the sixth grade would each pay the school 10 yuan, starting immediately, as a fee for self-study from 5 PM to 6 PM every day.

According to several student parents, this school charges 63 yuan per student in tuition fees this year, which is 23 yuan more than Dongmen Middle School in the same city. Now, they are also collecting self-study fees, which is unreasonable. Last year, this school created various reasons to collect over 10 different types of fees from students, including 10 yuan per person for toilet renovations. With over 900 students, nearly 10,000 yuan was collected for toilet construction. Relevant departments should address this issue of arbitrary fee collection.

　　自习一小时  收费十元钱
    ３月７日，孝感市书院中学决定，三年级６个班的３００多名学生，从即日起每人向学校交费１０元，作为每天下午５时至６时的学生自习费。
    据几位学生家长反映：这所中学今年向学生人均收学费６３元，比同在城区的东门中学高出２３元，现在又要收自习费，实在没有道理。去年，这所中学就巧立名目，向学生收取的各种费用项目达１０多种，其中修厕所每人收１０元，全校９００多人，交了建厕所费近万元。有关部门应管一管这种乱收费的现象。
