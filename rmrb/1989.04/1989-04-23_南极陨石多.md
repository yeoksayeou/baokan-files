Antarctica is a mysterious place, and the abundance of meteorites there is one of its "mysteries." Everyone knows that meteorites are extraterrestrial substances, serving as physical specimens for studying celestial bodies, and thus are extremely valuable. Currently, approximately 2,000 meteorites have been discovered worldwide, mostly in densely populated areas. However, in Antarctica, where the population density is virtually zero, since the Australian expedition team discovered the first meteorite there in December 1912, over 6,000 meteorites have been found. Of these 6,000, excluding the first one discovered by Australia, there are 2 from the Soviet Union, 6 from New Zealand, and the rest were discovered by Japan, the United States (with West Germany participating), and joint U.S.-Japanese expeditions. Among these, Japan collected 4,823, the United States collected 563, and the U.S.-Japanese joint expedition collected 628 (these figures are up to January 1, 1983).

Why are there so many meteorites in Antarctica?

Some people believe it is due to its location on the axis of rotation. If this were the case, why haven't a corresponding number of meteorites been found in the Arctic? Obviously, this is not the sole reason.

Another hypothesis suggests that the meteorites on the Antarctic continent were accumulated as they were transported by glaciers and obstructed by mountains and hills. Therefore, the discovery sites are almost all near the foothills of the mountains around Japan's Showa Station and the hills around the U.S. McMurdo Station's Allan Hills. Moreover, these meteorites are of various types, indicating that they did not fall simultaneously or in the same place. This hypothesis seems plausible.

　　南极陨石多
    夏之秋
    南极是个神秘的地方，那里有很多陨石就是一个“谜”。大家都知道，陨石是来自天外的物质，是研究宇宙星体的实物标本，所以十分珍贵。目前，全世界各地发现的陨石，大约有２０００块，一般都是在人口稠密地区发现的。但是，在人口密度几乎等于零的南极，自从１９１２年１２月澳大利亚探险队在那里首次发现一块陨石后，迄今已相继发现了６０００多块陨石。这６０００多块中，除澳大利亚发现的第一块外，有苏联２块，新西兰６块，其余是由日本、美国（西德参加）以及日美合作调查发现的，其中日本采得４８２３块，美国采得５６３块，日美合作采得６２８块（以上数字截止１９８３年元旦）。
    为什么南极会有这么多的陨石？
    有人认为，它是在自转轴上的缘故，如果真是这样，那么北极为什么没有发现相应数量的陨石呢，显然不单纯是这个原因。
    有人提出一种推测认为，南极大陆上的陨石，是在被冰川运移时遭到山脉丘陵的阻滞而聚集在一起的，所以发现地点几乎都是在日本昭和基地附近山脚以及美国麦克默多基地阿兰丘陵周围，并且是各种不同类型陨石混杂，说明它们不是同时同地陨落，看来这种推测是有道理的。
