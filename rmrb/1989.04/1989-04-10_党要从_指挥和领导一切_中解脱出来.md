The Party Must Break Free from "Directing and Leading Everything"

Zhang Bo Xing, Secretary of the CPC Shaanxi Provincial Committee

The report of the 13th Party Congress clearly stated that the Party's leadership is political leadership, and it gives this political leadership a rich and clear meaning. I believe that clarifying this issue in theory and practice is an urgent problem that all levels of Party organizations, especially Party leaders, must solve.

In the new era, the Party's work focus has shifted to modernization construction. The Party's basic line for the primary stage of socialism, which is "one center, two basic points," requires the Party to fully play the role of government agencies, social organizations, and enterprises, rather than acting as a substitute as in the past. Implementing the separation of Party and government and strengthening the Party's political leadership is a response to these new changes in the situation and tasks, and it is in line with the principles of historical materialism.

On this issue, any rigid and outdated ideas are wrong. Currently, many people still hold onto the traditional concept of Party leadership, clinging to the "unified leadership" model. They are concerned that if political leadership is mentioned, the Party's position will be lowered, its role will be diminished, its power will be lost, and there will be nothing to do in Party work. Many comrades engaged in Party affairs and ideological and political work even feel a sense of loss and inferiority. Shaanxi Province conducted a sample survey of 373 young and middle-aged cadres. 56.3% of them believed that the separation of Party and government would weaken the Party's leadership role and reduce its influence; 45% believed that the separation of Party and government "will not yield obvious results in practice" and "will only lead to distrust of the Party." When asked about the main difficulties in implementing the separation of Party and government, 38.1% believed it was due to "the Party and government officials not understanding." Notably, among these 373 cadres, 208 are at the county or bureau level, and 72% have a college education or higher. It seems that to do a good job in ideological work, update the concept of education, and strengthen the theoretical education of Party building in the new era, a lot of effort is still needed.

The Party's leadership is political leadership, that is, leadership in political principles and directions, rather than direct management of administrative affairs. This means that the Party's leadership over the state is reflected in the Party determining the political principles and directions of the state's development and deciding the direction of the state's development. This leadership is the highest level of leadership and the most authoritative leadership. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out, the Party "can only handle major issues, not minor ones." Therefore, we must break away from the idea of "unified leadership" in our minds, the concept of "one person in charge" in organizational leadership, the "all-in-one meeting" in decision-making, and the "one-size-fits-all" approach in work command. We must resolutely break free from the traditional concept of "the Party directing and leading everything."

The functions of the Party's leadership are to manage political principles and directions, major decisions, and to recommend important cadres to state organs. In practice, we have summarized this into ten characters: planning, guidance, personnel, education, and supervision.

In recent years, we have done a lot of work to improve the Party's leadership and have achieved some results. However, the problem of Party and government not being separate, with the Party replacing the government, has not been fundamentally solved. I believe that at present, we should mainly solve three problems in promoting the separation of Party and government.

First, we must focus on executing the functions of local Party committees.

The core of the separation of Party and government is the separation of Party and government functions. The 13th Party Congress clearly defined the five main responsibilities of local Party committees at all levels. We feel that among the five functions of local Party committees, "proposing decisions on major local issues" is the key and the most difficult to grasp. We must first clarify which issues should be decided by the local Party committee. Otherwise, it is easy to take on issues that should not be decided by the Party committee and to drop issues that should be decided by the Party committee.

Second, we must ensure the implementation of the separation of Party and government through organizational and institutional means.

In addition to first ensuring the separation of Party and government functions, effective measures must also be taken in organizational and institutional construction to implement the separation of Party and government.

In terms of organization, the separation of Party and government should fully consider the differences in the positions and responsibilities of Party organizations at all levels and should not adopt a single model or seek immediate results. The tasks at the grassroots level are more execution-oriented, and the Party and government should work closely together and coordinate their work, rather than being too detailed in their separation.

After the 13th Party Congress, we formulated or revised various work rules and regulations for the Provincial Party Committee, including the meeting procedures, content, and work procedures of the Standing Committee, and various local (municipal) and county Party committees also formulated their own regulations and institutions. This changed the past "unified leadership" model where the Party took on everything and decided on everything, providing institutional guarantees for the separation of Party and government.

From the practice in our province, to solve the problem of the separation of Party and government, there are a few difficult points that need to be broken through at present:

First, how the Party committee leads economic work. After the separation of Party and government, there is no question of whether the Party committee should lead economic work, but rather how the Party committee, from the perspective of overseeing the overall economic construction of the region, should grasp economic work under the condition of the separation of Party and government.

Second, how the Party committee leads ideological work. It is not appropriate for the Party committee to not manage ideological work, but it is also not appropriate for the Party committee's propaganda departments to directly manage the business work of government-sequence departments such as culture, radio and television, and news publishing alongside the government.

Third, how to handle the relationship between adhering to the principle of the Party managing cadres and the legal appointment and removal of administrative cadres. This problem is very sensitive, and if not handled well, the Party-government relationship will be difficult to coordinate. The key to solving the problem is to grasp the difference and internal connection between "recommendation" and "decision." Recommendation is a new way for the Party committee to manage cadres. Since it is a recommendation, it cannot be required that the People's Congress and the government must pass it. Since it is a recommendation, it is necessary to seriously investigate the cadres and avoid blind actions.

### 党要从“指挥和领导一切”中解脱出来

　　党要从“指挥和领导一切”中解脱出来
    中共陕西省委书记  张勃兴
    党的十三大报告明确提出，党的领导就是政治领导，并赋予政治领导以丰富的、明确的内涵。我以为，从理论和实践上搞清这个问题，是各级党组织，特别是党的领导干部迫切需要解决的问题。
    在新时期，我们党的工作重点已转移到现代化建设上来，党在社会主义初级阶段的基本路线即“一个中心，两个基本点”，要求党的领导必须充分发挥政权机关、社会团体和企事业的作用，而不能像过去那样包办代替。实行党政分开，加强党的政治领导，就是适应这种形势、任务的新变化而提出来的，是符合马克思主义历史唯物主义原理的。
    在这个问题上，任何僵化的、墨守陈规的观念都是错误的。现在不少人还停留在传统的党的领导观念上，抱着“一元化领导”模式不放。他们担心一提政治领导，党的地位就降低了，作用变小了，权力没有了，做党的工作无事可干了。不少从事党务工作、思想政治工作的同志，甚至产生一种失落感、自卑感。陕西省曾经对３７３名中青年干部抽样问卷调查。有５６．３％的人认为，党政分开会削弱党的领导作用，降低党的影响力；有４５％的人认为，党政分开“在实践中难以收到明显效果”、“只能导致人们对党的不信任”。而问及实行党政分开的主要困难，有３８．１％的人认为是“党政部门的干部思想不通”。值得注意的是，这３７３名干部中县处级干部占２０８人，大专以上文化程度的占７２％。看来，要做好思想工作，搞好更新观念的教育，加强新时期党的建设理论的教育，还要用很大的力气。
    党的领导属于政治领导，即政治原则、政治方向的领导，而不是直接管行政事务。这就是说，党对国家的领导是体现在党确定国家发展的政治原则、政治方向，决定国家的发展沿着什么样的道路前进的问题。这种领导是最高层次的领导、最有权威的领导。正如邓小平同志所指出的，党“只能管大事，不能管小事”。为此，必须破除思想上“一元化领导”观点、组织领导上“一把手”观念，摒弃决策上的“一揽子会议”，工作指挥上的“一把抓”。坚决从传统的“党指挥一切、领导一切”的观念中解脱出来。
    党的领导职能是管政治原则、政治方向，重大决策和向国家机关推荐重要干部。在实践中，我们概括成十个字：规划、指导、用人、教育、监督。
    近几年来，我们为改善党的领导做了不少工作，有一定成效。但是，长期形成的党政不分、以党代政问题还没有从根本上解决。我以为，当前推进党政分开的步伐，主要应该解决三个问题。
    一是要在执行地方党委职能上下功夫。
    党政分开的核心，是党政职能分开。地方各级党委的职能，十三大明确规定为五项主要职责。我们体会，地方党委的五项职能中，“对地方性的重大问题提出决策”这一条是关键，也最不好把握。必须首先弄清楚哪些属于应当由地方党委决策的重大问题。不然，就容易把一些不该由党委决策的事情揽到党委来决策，而把一些应该由党委决策的事情丢掉。
    二是要从组织、制度上保证党政分开的实施。
    实行党政分开，除首先抓好党政职能分开外，还必须从组织上、制度建设上采取有效措施。
    从组织上解决党政分开问题，要充分考虑到各级党组织所处地位和担负责任的差异性，不搞一个模式，不求一步到位。基层执行性的任务偏多，党政双方要密切配合、协同工作，不能分得过细。
    十三大之后，我们制定或修定了省委各种工作规则和制度，包括常委会的议事制度、议事内容和工作程序，各地（市）、县委也制定了自己的规定和制度，改变了过去党包揽一切，什么事情都要拿到党委决定的“一元化模式”，使党政分开问题有了制度上的保证。
    从我省的实践看，要解决好党政分开问题，目前有几个难点需要突破：
    一是党委如何领导经济工作。地方党政分开后，不存在党委该不该领导经济的问题，而是在党政分开条件下，党委站在总揽本地区经济建设全局的高度，如何抓好经济工作的问题。
    二是党委如何领导意识形态工作。地方党委不管意识形态方面的工作不对，但像目前这样由党委的宣传部门直接和政府并行管理政府序列的文化、广播电视、新闻出版等部门业务工作的做法，也是不妥当的。
    三是如何处理好坚持党管干部的原则和依法任免行政干部的关系。这个问题非常敏感，搞得不好，党政关系很难协调。解决问题的关键，是把握好“推荐”与“决定”的区别和内在联系。推荐是党委管理干部的一种新的方式。既是推荐，就不能要求人大、政府都通过。既要推荐，就必须认真考察干部，力戒盲目之举。
