Title: In Search of the Roots of "Reading is Useless"

From ancient times to the present, the two traditional cultures of China and the West have formed different value systems regarding the utility of knowledge. Our ancestors believed: “Study hard and you will become an official,” “Books contain golden houses and beautiful women,” so “All other professions are inferior, only reading is superior.” Foreign philosophers, on the other hand, advocated: “Reading can soothe the mind and enhance talent.” “Knowledge is power” (Francis Bacon), “Knowledge is the companion of man on any road” (Guramishvili). “Only knowledge can form the source of great wealth, making the land fertile and culture flourish” (Zola). Thus, although different social, cultural, and historical backgrounds led them to define the utility of knowledge differently, they still basically affirmed that knowledge is useful.

The denial of knowledge occurred in China during the 1960s. During the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese people broke completely with the ancient and modern, Eastern and Western consensus that “knowledge is useful.” Why was reading useless? Because “the more knowledge you have, the more reactionary you are,” you would face political discrimination, while rebellion could lead to official positions, and blank exam papers could make you a hero. The temporary separation of knowledge from officialdom caused the entire nation to experience the first loss of confidence in the utility of knowledge.

The consequences of the Cultural Revolution taught the Chinese people a lesson. With the restoration of the national college entrance examination and other rectifications, if one wants their child to succeed, they must still walk the lonely path of “diligent study leads to success.” Millions of young people, with the determination of “suspended from the beam, stabbed by the stock,” rushed towards the gates of key schools. The talent scouts once again favored “knowledge.” A “thousand-mile horse” wanting to enter officialdom must saddle up with a diploma. Thus, the frenzy of pursuing diplomas was astonishing. Government departments and organizations, which were once short of talent, suddenly saw an unprecedented number of “college graduates” and “bachelor’s degree holders”; even some officials who once prided themselves on being “rough and tough” managed to find a suitable diploma for themselves, shamelessly claiming that they had also attended university. The extreme expansion of officialdom, although it once again united diplomas with officialdom, artificially separated knowledge from diplomas. A diploma, easily obtained, made people realize the futility of “ten years of hard study.” The entire society experienced the second loss of confidence in the utility of knowledge.

The rise of a commodity economy led people from the limited paths of officialdom to the numerous paths of wealth. In the circulation domain, “heroes emerge in turbulent times,” and a wave of business enthusiasm swept through party, government, military, civilians, and students. When the Chinese people realized that the ink in their stomachs was not proportional to the money in their pockets, they again experienced a loss of confidence in the utility of knowledge.

Over the past 20-plus years, from the Cultural Revolution to the present, the “reading is useless” trend has spread twice, with increasing harm and influence. Tracing its roots, it is all connected to the traditional Chinese cultural view of the utility of knowledge. Indeed, the traditional Chinese culture’s understanding of knowledge is not entirely about emphasizing its utilitarian aspect. However, from the Sui Dynasty to the end of the Qing Dynasty’s Guangxu 31st year, a total of over 1,300 years of the feudal dynasty’s civil service examination system for selecting officials, inevitably made later generations’ understanding of the utility of knowledge extremely biased and skewed. People overlooked or even ignored the great role of knowledge in improving one’s own qualities and realizing social value, and did not regard knowledge as “the companion of man on any road,” but rather saw reading as a stepping stone to officialdom and wealth! When seeking official positions and making money required diplomas, people would tightly hold onto them; when officialdom and wealth had little to do with diplomas, people would discard them like old shoes. Reflecting on the rise and fall of the “reading is useless” trend yesterday and today, is it not like this?

In fact, whether reading is useful or not is self-evident. If there were no desire for “raising a dragon,” where would the interest in investing in education come from? If the purpose of reading is to pursue officialdom and wealth, then when ignorance can also make one a powerful figure or a wealthy tycoon, what use is there in reading?

### 我寻“读书无用”之根系

　　我寻“读书无用”之根系
　　中国社会科学院研究生院　何庆良
    古往今来，对于知识的功用，中外两种传统文化形成了不同的价值观。我们的先贤们认为：“学而优则仕”，“书中自有黄金屋，书中自有颜如玉”，所以，“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”。而外国的哲人们则鼓吹：“读书足以怡情，足以长才。”“知识就是力量”（培根），“知识是人们在任何一条道路上的旅伴”（古拉米施维里）。“只有知识才能构成巨大的财富的源泉，既使土地获得丰收，又使文化繁荣昌盛”
  （左拉）。由此可见，尽管不同的社会文化历史背景使他们在界定知识的功用时产生了分野，但他们还是基本肯定，知识是有用的。
    对知识的否定，发生在20世纪60年代的中国。大“革”文化“命”期间，国人与“知识有用”这个古今中外的公理实行了最彻底的“决裂”。读书何以无用呢？因为“知识越多越反动”会受到政治上的歧视，而造反可以做官，交白卷成为英雄。知识与仕途的一度分离，使举国上下对知识的功用产生了第一次失落的心态。
    大“革”文化“命”的后果，教训了国人。随着恢复高考等拨乱反正，如欲“望子成龙”，还要走到“书山有路勤为径”的独木桥上，亿万青少年以“悬梁刺股”的劲头挤向“重点校”的大门。伯乐选马，又相中了“知识化”。“千里马”要踏上仕途，文凭的鞍辔是非要披挂不可的。于是乎，追求文凭的狂热程度让人瞠目。一度缺乏“人才”的政府部门和机关内如雨后春笋般地涌现了难以数计的“大专生”、“本科生”；甚至某些一向以“大老粗”出身为自豪的官员们竟可瞒天过海地为自己寻觅一个与官位相称的学历，毫无愧色地宣称先前也曾上过大学。官本位的极度膨胀，虽然使文凭与仕途再度结合在一起，但是，知识与文凭却被人为地剥离了，一纸唾手可得的文凭使人们辨明了“十年寒窗”的迂腐。整个社会对知识的功用产生了第二次失落的心态。
    商品经济的勃兴，把人们从屈指可数的仕途引上了四通八达的财路。流通领域中，“乱世英雄起四方”，一哄而起的经商热席卷了党政军民学。当国人明白，肚子里的墨水与兜里的票子并不是成正比时，对知识的功用又产生了第二次失落的心态。
    从“文革”至今的20多年中，“读书无用”的思潮两次蔓延，危害之大，影响之深，愈演愈烈。追根溯源，无一不与中国传统文化中对于知识功用的价值取向有着一脉相承的联系。诚然，中国传统文化对于知识的认识并不都是一味地强调其功利的一面，但是，从隋文帝开始直至清光绪31年终止的、先后延续了1300多年的封建王朝选拔官吏的科举制度，毕竟使后人对于知识功用的认识产生了极度的倚重和倾斜。人们轻视甚至忽视知识对于提高人的自身素质，进而实现社会价值的巨大作用，没有把知识当作“人们在任何一条道路上的旅伴”，而是把读书当作升官、发财的一块敲门砖！当营谋官职与生财致富要用文凭开路时，人们就会紧紧地抱住它；当仕途和财路与文凭并无多大干连时，人们就会弃之如敝屣。细细回味一下“读书无用”思潮在昨天与今天的涨退起伏，何尝不是如此呢？
    其实，读书究竟是有用还是无用是不言自明的。如果并无“望子成龙”的企求，哪儿来的向教育投资的兴趣？倘使读书的目的就是为了奔向仕途和财路，那么，当不学无术也能成为出人头地的实权派或是腰缠万贯的财神爷时，读书还有什么用？！
