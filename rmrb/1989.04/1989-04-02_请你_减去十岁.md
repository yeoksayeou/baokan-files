Currently, many middle-aged and elderly people are seeking and adopting various methods to maintain health and longevity. The method of "subtracting 10 years" is worth a try.

To "subtract 10 years" means to keep your hobbies, interests, pursuits, and overall psychological environment at the level they were ten years ago.

In recent years, scientists have conducted extensive research and exploration, concluding that this approach is necessary.

From the perspective of psychological analysis, if a person can maintain their psychological environment at the level it was ten years ago, their good mental state will undoubtedly have a positive feedback effect on their physical health. Research has shown that the immune system's function is directly dependent on the brain. A "rejuvenated" psychological environment will undoubtedly promote the "rejuvenation" of the immune system's function, thereby enhancing the overall function of various organs in the body. Therefore, it is necessary to actively create a "rejuvenated" psychological environment to improve health levels.

　　请你
    减去十岁
    眼下，许多中老年人都在寻找和采取各种方法使自己健康长寿。这里所说“减去１０岁”之法你不妨一试。
    请你减去１０岁，就是使你的爱好、兴趣、追求及整个心理环境要保持在十年前的水平上。
    近年来，科学家们经过大量的研究和探索，得出结论：这样做是必要的。
    从精神心理学角度分析，一个人能使自己的心理环境保持在十年前的水平，那么良好的精神素质必然会对身体素质起到良好的反馈作用。研究表明，免疫系统的功能直接依赖于大脑，“年青化”的精神心理环境必然促进免疫系统功能的“年青化”，这就使人体各器官的功能得到全方位的巩固和提高。由此可见，主动创造“年青化”的心态环境，是提高健康水平的必要手段。
