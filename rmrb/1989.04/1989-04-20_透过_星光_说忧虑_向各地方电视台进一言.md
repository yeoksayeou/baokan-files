The results of the third National Television Arts "Star Light Award" have been announced, and the trophies have been awarded. During the selection process, I had the opportunity to view various television gala shows, scenic videos, and music videos sent by local television stations. I discovered many issues that deserve attention.

	Gaudy but Insignificant
	Some television galas are grand in scale, with dazzling lights and vibrant colors, reaching a "super-luxurious" level. However, in terms of content, the songs are not captivating, and the dances are not impressive, resulting in poor artistic effects. The dazzling lights and flashing effects not only overwhelm the performers but also strain the viewers' visual senses. The expenditure is enormous, but the returns are minimal.

	Grand but Irrelevant
	Some television stations produce scenic and music videos with the intention of reflecting local landscapes, local customs, or social conditions. However, they often aim too high and try to cover too much, turning small things into big ones and short things into long ones. Some even invite famous performers to enhance the appeal, having them insert a few songs that are quite unrelated to the main theme of the video. Often, the ending of the video strays far from the original topic, sometimes showing majestic Kunlun Mountains or Jiangnan scenery, and other times vast grasslands or desert sands, becoming increasingly off-topic.

	Superfluous Additions
	Using dance to accompany songs is generally a good idea, but sometimes it is overdone. Some dances are poorly choreographed, and some are completely unrelated to the song's content. Instead of enhancing the atmosphere, they disrupt or even ruin the visual and auditory effects.

	Too Similar
	Many works have similar structures and use the same techniques. The singers invited are often the same few individuals. Two veteran musicians lamented: In the 1950s, dance was scarce, and people would say, "From Nanjing to Beijing, it's all 'Running Donkey' and 'Lotus Lantern,'" meaning that if you've seen one performance, you've seen them all. Today, television arts are much richer than dance creations of the past, but artistic repetition weakens the advantage of quantity.

	Television artists often lament, "A skilled cook can't make a meal without rice," and their feelings are understandable. However, even in difficult times, one must still leverage the magic of television thinking.

### 透过“星光”说忧虑——向各地方电视台进一言

　　透过“星光”说忧虑    
    ——向各地方电视台进一言
    赵国政
    第三届全国电视文艺《星光奖》的评选结果已经揭晓，奖杯各有所属。在评选过程中，我有幸看到各地电视台送来的名目繁多的各种电视晚会片，以及风光片、音乐片，发现很多值得重视的问题。
    华而不实　有的电视晚会场面阔绰，灯光艳丽，色彩花哨，达到了“超豪华”的程度，观其内容，却歌不动听，舞不惊人，艺术效果不佳。令人眼花缭乱的飞光流电不仅把表演者吞没了，观众的视觉神经也难以承受。耗费巨资，得不偿失。
    大而无当　某些电视台摄制的风光片、音乐片，意在反映当地山光水色，风土民情或社会风貌，偏偏贪大求全，将小变大，将短拉长，有的拉上名演员以壮声色，让她（他）加塞进去唱几首与该片主旨颇不搭调的歌曲。片尾常常引伸开去，时而巍巍昆仑、江南秀色，时而草原奔马、大漠飞沙，离题愈来愈远。
    画蛇添足　以舞伴歌，本是好事，有时却用得太滥。有的舞编得粗糙，有的与歌的内容完全无关，非但不能渲染烘托气氛，反而干扰甚至破坏了视听效果。
    彼此雷同　不少作品结构相同，手法雷同，所聘请的歌星，翻来覆去就那么几个。两位老音乐家感慨地说：五十年代舞蹈匮乏，群众中流传“南京到北京，《跑驴》、《荷花灯》”，意思是看了一家演出，别的便不用看了。今天的电视文艺比当年的舞蹈创作丰富得多，但艺术上的重复，削弱了数量上的优势。
    电视艺术家常常感慨“巧媳妇难为无米之炊”，他们的心情可以理解。但艰难中仍需发挥电视思维的魔力。
