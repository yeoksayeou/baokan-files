	Awakening the Drunken Officials
	Li Demin

	Faced with a banquet, some cadres feign an attitude: “This wine cannot be refused; drinking is also for the sake of work.”

	“For the sake of work” has become a pretext for some drunken officials to squander public funds and indulge in feasting. When superiors come, they need to be “welcomed”; when neighbors visit, they need to be “acknowledged”; there are also old cadres revisiting old places, famous performers attending performances, big reporters conducting in-depth interviews, as well as those who have indirect connections. All of these are reasons for some people to drink official wine, all are “special circumstances,” all are “one-time exceptions.” In reality, whether it is the host who wants to drink, or the guest who wants to drink, or both the host and the guest want to drink, no one can say for sure. The absurdity is that after the guests have had their fill of food and wine, they still sigh a few times about the decline of human nature and curse a few times about unethical practices.

	Whether it is “for the sake of work,” the common people know it well. Just as a folk song says: “The working class suffers, the officials get drunk,” “drinking seven or eight cups without getting drunk, playing cards all night without getting tired, that is the standard of some officials.” The words may be harsh, but they are honest advice. In some units, there is indeed a pervasive aroma of wine, and those officials who constantly move between banquets are indeed not a small number. Drinking has become a social problem.

	It is said that the intention of drunken officials is not in the wine, but in “building relationships and expanding connections” and the like. If you want to do something, official seals and introduction letters are useless. Once the wine is flowing and the ears are warm, everything goes smoothly. Although this trick may be effective for a while, it is not the right way and will one day result in a bloody head. Therefore, believing in this vulgar relationship theory not only will lose the Party's principles but also will destroy oneself.

	“Drunken officials” have been recorded in history, and their reputations are mostly bad. It is unexpected that there are still many such people today. Since drunken officials are intoxicated by the aroma of wine, they should be demoted. Because, once drunk, what can they do? And what can they not do? The incident reported by our newspaper today, where two officials in Xixia County lost their lives due to drunk driving, is enough to serve as a warning.

### 醉官当醒

　　醉官当醒
　　李德民
    面对酒宴，有的干部故作姿态：“这酒不能不喝，喝酒也是为了工作。”
    “为了工作”，竟然成了一些醉官挥霍公款、大吃大喝的一个冠冕堂皇的“理由”。上级来人要“接风”，友邻来了要“表示”，还有旧地重游的老干部、光临演出的名演员、深入采访的大记者，以及拐弯抹角的关系户、关系人，都是某些人喝官酒的“理由”，都是“特殊情况”，都是“下不为例”。其实，到底是主人想喝，还是客人想喝，或者主客双方都想喝，谁也说不清。滑稽的是，食客酒足饭饱之后还要慨叹几声人心不古，骂上几句不正之风。
    是不是“为了工作”，老百姓心知肚明。正像一首顺口溜说的：“苦了上班的，醉了当官的”，“喝酒七八两不醉，打牌通宵不累，就是某些长官的水平。”话虽难听，却是诤言。在一些单位里，确实弥漫着阵阵醉人的酒香，那些整天周旋于酒席筵宴之间的官们，实在不是一个小数。喝酒成了一个社会问题。
    据说，醉官之意不在酒，在乎“联络感情，扩大交往”之类。你要办什么事，公章、介绍信不顶用，一旦酒酣耳热，便万事亨通。这种招数虽然一时有效，毕竟不是正途，总有一天会碰个头破血流的。所以，信奉这种庸俗关系学，不仅会丢掉党的原则，也会把自己毁掉。
    “醉官”是上了史书的，其名声大多不好，没想到至今仍不乏人。醉官既然沉迷于酒香，那就削其“官”罢了。因为，醉了，还能干什么呢？又有什么干不出来呢？本报今日披露的西峡县两位干部因醉酒而送掉两条人命的事，足以引人警戒。
