Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, April 15th — In many rural areas of Shandong, people are currently abandoning the traditional practice of "burial for peace" and instead placing urns in village memorial halls. Many people humorously refer to these village memorial halls as "rural Eight Treasure Mountain."

As is well known, Eight Treasure Mountain is a revolutionary cemetery in the western suburbs of Beijing.

It is understood that in more than 100 counties (cities, districts) in Shandong, almost every county has several village memorial halls, and the construction of such memorial halls is on the rise. Located on the Jiaodong Peninsula, Hongguang Village in Longkou Town invested 700,000 yuan and completed a memorial hall in late 1987 that can accommodate 900 urns.

Chen Limin, deputy head of the village committee, told the reporter: In recent years, when villagers pass away, they are cremated, but they are not accustomed to keeping the urns at home. Instead, they are buried in the responsibility fields or in the woods.

After the memorial hall was built, villagers were willing to place their relatives' urns here. During the Spring Festival, Qingming Festival, and Mid-Autumn Festival, villagers come to the memorial hall to bow, offer flowers, and express their grief. The practice of burning incense and paper money has also been curtailed.

Zhang Jianjun, deputy director of the Shandong Provincial Civil Affairs Department, said in an interview with the reporter: Currently, the phenomenon of the dead competing with the living for land is serious in China, with nearly 1 million mu of land being used for burials each year. Building memorial halls in rural areas is undoubtedly a promotion for funeral reform. However, the handling of ashes is not a one-size-fits-all solution. There can be various methods, such as deep burial in a fixed place without occupying arable land, setting up cemeteries, etc., all of which are allowed.

It is reported that Shandong Province began promoting funeral reform in the early 1960s, and cremation has been basically popularized throughout the province.

### 破入土为安旧习　树丧葬改革新风　山东出现“乡间八宝山”

　　破入土为安旧习　树丧葬改革新风
　　山东出现“乡间八宝山”
    新华社济南４月１５日电　（记者徐德文）在山东的许多乡村，目前人们正摈弃死者“入土为安”的传统习惯，取而代之的是将一只只骨灰盒安放在村办纪念堂内。对于这种村办纪念堂，许多人诙谐地称之为“乡间八宝山”。
    众所周知，八宝山是首都北京西郊的一所革命公墓。
    据了解，山东１００多个县（市、区），几乎每县都有几处村办纪念堂，而这种纪念堂的兴建正呈不断发展之势。位于胶东半岛的龙口镇红光村，投资７万元，于１９８７年底建成可容纳９００个骨灰盒的纪念堂。
    村民委员会副主任陈立民向记者介绍：这些年，村里人死了都火化，但不习惯把骨灰盒放在家里，而是葬在责任田或埋到树林里。
    纪念堂建成后，村民们都愿将亲人的骨灰盒安放在这里。每年春节、清明节和中秋节，村民们来纪念堂为死去的亲属鞠躬、献花寄托哀思，焚香、烧纸的事也不禁自绝了。
    山东省民政厅副厅长张建军在接受记者采访时说：当前中国死人与活人争地现象严重，每年土葬占地近１００万亩。农村建纪念堂对于推行丧葬改革无疑是一个促进。但对骨灰的处理也不是搞一刀切，方式可多样化，比如在不占用耕地的前提下，固定一个地方深埋、设公墓等都是允许的。
    据介绍，山东省从６０年代初就开始推行殡葬改革，火葬已在全省基本普及。
