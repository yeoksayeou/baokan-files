The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson today issued a statement regarding the Vietnamese government's announcement on April 5. The full text of the statement is as follows:

We have noted that the Vietnamese government, in its statement on April 5, reiterated its commitment to withdraw its troops from Cambodia by the end of September this year. We hope that Vietnam will genuinely fulfill its announced pledge and withdraw all its armed forces from Cambodia completely and cleanly by the specified time, without using any pretext to return.

The withdrawal of Vietnamese troops must be conducted under effective international supervision. We support Prince Sihanouk's position that the composition of the international supervision should not be designated by Vietnam. We believe that the United Nations Secretary-General, after consulting with relevant countries, should oversee the establishment of the international supervision mechanism.

It must also be pointed out that the Cambodian issue was caused by Vietnam's aggression. Any attempt to justify Vietnam's aggression on any grounds is untenable. Vietnam bears an inescapable responsibility for the comprehensive resolution of the Cambodian issue, as well as for the peace and stability in Cambodia after its withdrawal.

China's support for the Cambodian resistance against Vietnamese aggression is completely justified. We reiterate once again that after it is verified that Vietnam has completely withdrawn its troops, China will, together with other relevant countries, cease military assistance to all factions in Cambodia.

　　外交部发言人就越声明发表谈话
    希望越南真正履行诺言  如期彻底干净从柬撤军
    本报北京４月６日讯  中国外交部发言人今天就越南政府４月５日的声明发表谈话。谈话全文如下：
    我们注意到越南政府４月５日发表声明重申于今年９月底以前从柬埔寨撤军。我们希望越南真正履行宣布的诺言，如期、彻底、干净地撤出它在柬埔寨的一切武装力量，并不以任何借口重返柬埔寨。
    越南撤军必须在有效的国际监督下进行。我们支持西哈努克亲王关于国际监督的组成不应由越南指定的立场。我们认为应由联合国秘书长经同有关国家协商后，主持建立国际监督机制。
    还必须指出，柬埔寨问题是由越南侵略造成的，以任何理由为越南的侵略辩护，都是站不住脚的。越南对柬埔寨问题的全面解决，以及越南撤军后的柬埔寨和平与稳定负有不可推卸的责任。
    中国支持柬埔寨抵抗越南的侵略是完全正义的。我们再次重申，在经过核查证明越南全部撤军之后，中国将同其他有关国家一起停止对柬埔寨各派的军事援助。
