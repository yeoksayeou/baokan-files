	Recently, I went to Xiji County in Ningxia, one of the areas of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Program, on a business trip. I found that nearly ten thousand acres of grassy hills and forests here have been severely damaged, which is heartbreaking.

	It is understood that Xiji County was listed by the state as a key county for investment and aid in the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Program in 1979. From 1979 to 1985, the state invested nearly 100 million yuan in forestry funds in Xiji County; the World Food Organization also provided several ten thousand tons of grain aid and sent experts several times for investigation and guidance. After several years of hard work, the barren hills and mountains of Xiji County were covered with green, and soil erosion was somewhat alleviated.

	However, the good times did not last long. According to local residents, since 1986, human destruction of forests has become increasingly serious. County and township leaders only issue orders to village cadres without conducting in-depth propaganda and education work at the grassroots level, while village cadres' only management method is to impose fines. Over time, fines are no longer effective. Since 1987, flocks of sheep have been roaming the mountains, and the trees have been trampled beyond recognition. In recent years, nearly ten thousand acres of greened wasteland have been destroyed by livestock, and more than a thousand acres of grassy hills and forests have been cut down by humans. Many reclaimed land areas have been reclaimed for farming.

	Now, from the southwestern part of Xiji County in Ningxia to the border with Huining County in Gansu, the 60-kilometer-long forest belt in Suzhuang Township and Sanhe Township is sparse, with broken tree stumps everywhere. The trees that have not been destroyed by humans have all been nibbled bare by sheep. In Hongzhuang Village, Suzhuang Township, I saw that all the trees on the mountains had been nibbled bare by sheep. I appeal to the relevant departments to take measures to save the shelterbelt here.

### 绿化了的荒山又秃了

　　绿化了的荒山又秃了
    不久前，我到三北防护林之一的宁夏西吉县出差，发现这里近万亩草山和林木破坏严重，令人痛心。
    据了解，西吉县于１９７９年就被国家列为三北防护林工程投资援助重点县。１９７９年至１９８５年，国家向西吉县投资近亿元林业专款；世界粮食组织也给以几万吨粮食援助，并几次派专家前来考察指导。经过几年的艰苦努力，西吉县的荒山秃岭披上了绿装，水土流失有所缓解。
    可是好景不长。据当地群众反映，从１９８６年以来，人为的毁林现象日趋严重。县乡领导干部只向村干部发号施令，不深入基层做宣传教育工作，而村干部唯一的管理办法是罚款。时间一长，罚款也不灵了。１９８７年以来，羊群满山跑，林木被糟踏得不成样子。前几年，绿化的几万亩荒山，被牲畜毁掉的就有近万亩，人为砍伐的草山和林木上千亩，许多退耕还林地又退林还耕了。
    如今从宁夏西吉县城西南起到与甘肃会宁县接壤的苏堡乡、三合乡，近６０公里长的防护林带树木稀稀拉拉，到处留下的是被人折断的小树茬子，没有被人毁掉的树也都被羊啃光了树皮。在苏堡乡红庄村，我看到满山的树木被羊啃光了树皮。呼吁有关部门采取措施，拯救这里的防护林。
