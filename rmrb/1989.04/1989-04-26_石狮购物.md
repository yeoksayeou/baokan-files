Fujian's Shishi is famous nationwide for its small clothing and accessory market. Every day, tens of thousands of shoppers flock to this market.

Locals warned us outsiders: once you haggle over a price, you better buy it, or you might get into trouble. With tens of thousands of shops, it's impossible to visit each one. Just by walking around a few streets without asking, you can get a general idea of the goods and prices here. The clothes here aren't particularly fashionable or cheap. Although there are many items, most seem to be imported from street vendors elsewhere.

After spending half a day negotiating, I bought a skirt for 20 yuan from a female shop owner. Anyone with a bit of knowledge could tell it was made of synthetic fibers, but the shop owner insisted it was wool and that she was selling it at a loss. Back in Beijing, when I washed it, the price tag, which had been glued on with paste, came off, revealing a hole that was neither too big nor too small!

　　石狮购物
    桂莲
    福建石狮的服装小商品市场，闻名全国有几年了，每天来这里的购物者，不下几万人。
    当地人告诉我们这些外来人：买东西看准了再还价，还了价不买，当心惹麻烦。上万个店铺，不能一一涉足。只看不问，踏过几条街，也大致知道了这里的货色和行情。这里的服装说不上时髦，也说不上便宜，商品虽多，看上去多是舶来的地摊货。
    来一趟，总要买点什么。费了半天唇舌，花二十元钱从一位女老板手中买了一条裙子。稍有一点常识的人，都辨别得出是化纤织物，但女老板一口咬定是毛织物，卖亏了。回到北京，拿出来清洗，不想，裙子上用浆糊贴得紧紧的价格标签洗掉了，露出一个不大不小的窟窿！
