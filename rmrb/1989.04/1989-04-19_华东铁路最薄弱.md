Railways are the weakest link in the national transportation system, and East China's railways are the weakest among them. From 1958 to 1987, the Shanghai Railway Bureau's equivalent turnover volume increased by 6.75 times, while the operational mileage of the railways only increased by 1.8 times, accounting for just 10% of the national total.

According to predictions, by the end of the century, the total industrial and agricultural output value of the Shanghai economic zone will be 2.3 times that of 1980. The amount of coal transported into East China will increase by 202.6%, the equivalent turnover volume of railways will need to increase by 114%, and the average number of train rides per person per year will rise from the current 0.71 to 1.1 (the current national average). To achieve this volume of transportation, the entire bureau will need at least 8,700 kilometers of operational railways, but currently, the bureau only has 5,400 kilometers of operational railways.

In 1986, the State Council approved the implementation of a comprehensive economic contract responsibility system for the railway industry and decided to strengthen and renovate 16,000 kilometers of railways in the Northeast and coastal regions. This brought hope to the struggling railways in East China and marked a positive turn. However, compared to the construction scale of the "Taking from the Middle to Support the East" project and the development needs of the Shanghai economic zone by the end of the century, there is still a significant gap. Currently, the "Taking from the Middle to Support the East" project faces new problems. The investment budget set in 1986 can no longer achieve the original construction scale and capacity expansion goals due to price factors.

Looking at the nature, status, impact, and current situation of the railways, the following steps should be taken:

Firstly, the economic policies outlined in the State Council's approved document for the comprehensive economic contract responsibility system for railways should be implemented to improve the development environment for railways and address the issue of "low income versus high expenditure and fixed freight rates versus fluctuating commodity prices." This will support the completion of railway construction and renovation tasks.

Secondly, from the central government departments to local sectors, everyone should understand, care about, and support the railways, providing financial, credit, tax, investment, depreciation, and wage support, especially for coastal railways.

Thirdly, both central and local governments should be proactive in developing local railways. By adopting measures such as renovating old lines and building new backbone lines in the network with national investment, and financing other new lines and comprehensive supporting facilities (such as freight yards and stations) in the network plan through local funds (including investments from state-owned, collective, and private enterprises), the construction of railways can be accelerated.

### 华东铁路最薄弱

　　华东铁路最薄弱
    上海铁路局局长　韩杼滨
    铁路在全国是薄弱环节，而华东铁路则是最薄弱的环节。从１９５８年到１９８７年的３０年间，上海铁路局换算周转量增长６．７５倍，而铁路营业里程只增长了１．８倍，营业里程只占全国的１０％。
    据预测，本世纪末上海经济区工农业总产值要比１９８０年翻２．３番，调入华东的煤炭将增长２０２．６％，铁路换算周转量需增长１１４％，人均年乘车次数从目前的０．７１次提高到人均１．１次（即目前全国的平均水平），完成这样的运量，全局至少需要８７００公里营业铁路，而我局目前只有５４００公里营业铁路。
    １９８６年，国务院批准铁路实行全行业经济承包，并决定对东北及沿海１６０００公里铁路实行强化改造，这给处于困境中的华东铁路带来了希望，出现了好的转机。但是，按“中取华东”建设规模与上海经济区到本世纪末的发展要求比较，还有很大差距。而目前“中取华东”又面临新的问题。１９８６年所确定的投资概算，由于价格的因素，已根本无法完成原定建设规模和扩能目标。
    从铁路的性质、地位、影响和现状看，当前，首先要落实国务院批准的铁路实行大包干文件中规定的经济政策，改善铁路发展环境，解决“低收入对高支出，死运价对活物价”的问题，支持铁路完成建设改造任务。其次，要从中央各部门到地方各界，都要理解、关心和支持铁路，从财政、信贷、税收、投资、折旧、工资等方面扶植铁路，特别是沿海地区的铁路。再次，要发挥中央和地方两个积极性，大力发展地方铁路，采取旧线改造和路网中的骨干新线由国家投资，路网规划中的其它新线和现有线路的综合配套设施（如货场、车站等）由地方集资（包括国营企业、集体企业、私营企业投资参股）办法，加快铁路的建设。
