Recently, a toothbrush auctioned in Munich, West Germany, was priced at an astonishing 38,000 West German Marks, equivalent to 21,000 US dollars.

This toothbrush is a relic of Napoleon. It is not only valuable because it once cared for Napoleon's teeth, but also because it is a witness to the destruction of the empire. It was picked up by a British officer as a trophy during the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Who would have thought that 173 years later, this toothbrush would become a "rare treasure"? However, due to the high price, the auction did not go through.

　　拍卖拿破化的牙刷
    不久前在西德慕尼黑拍卖的一把牙刷要价竟高达三万八千西德马克，折合二万一千美元。
    这把牙刷是拿破仑的遗物。它之所以“价值连城”，不仅是因为它保健过拿破伦的牙齿，而且还因为它是帝国毁灭的见证物之一。它是在一八一五年的滑铁卢战役中被一个英国军官作为战利品拣回。没想到，在一百七十三年后的今天，这把牙刷竟成了“稀世珍品”。不过由于要价太高，拍卖没有成交。　　·成林·
