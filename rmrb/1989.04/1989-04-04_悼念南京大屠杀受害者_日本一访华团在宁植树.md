Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, April 3rd.

A delegation from Japan, led by Kikuchi Zenryu and advised by Mukai Ryu, visited Nanjing to plant trees in memory of the victims of the Nanjing Massacre. The delegation held a commemorative activity at the Memorial Hall of the Victims of the Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Invaders and planted trees in Zhennuquan Park.

This morning, 83-year-old Kikuchi Zenryu, representing the 41 members of the delegation, laid a wreath in memory of the victims of the Nanjing Massacre. In his speech, he said: "The purpose of our visit is to apologize to the Chinese people. We want to use tree planting and greening to make amends for the damage caused by that war. This is our fourth tree-planting delegation to China. In the future, this 'greening to atone for sins' activity will continue, so that the people of China and Japan will never forget that sinful war and will remain friends for generations to come."

In recent years, the Japanese delegation commemorating the victims of the Nanjing Massacre has donated 40,000 tree saplings to Nanjing and has personally planted more than 10,000 trees.

    据新华社南京４月３日电  （记者高峰）以菊池善隆为团长、向坊隆为顾问的日本第四次悼念南京大屠杀受害者植树访华团，今天在南京侵华日军大屠杀纪念馆举行了悼念活动，并在珍珠泉公园植了树。
    今天上午，８３岁的菊池善隆在悼念仪式上，代表全团４１名团员向南京大屠杀的受害者敬献了花圈。他在讲话中说：“我们此行的目的是向中国人民谢罪，我们要用植树绿化来补偿那场战争对中国的损害。这次是我们组织的第四次植树访华团，今后这种‘绿化赎罪活动’将一直进行下去，使中日两国人民永远不忘记那场罪恶的战争，世世代代友好下去。”
