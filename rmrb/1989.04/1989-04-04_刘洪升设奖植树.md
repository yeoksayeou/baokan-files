Liu Hongsheng, a common farmer from Xitang Village, Huji Township, Dongguang County, Hebei Province, has spent the past three years contributing 360,000 yuan to pay the collective levies for 900-plus villagers whose tree planting success rates reached over 90%. Liu Hongsheng made money by taking over the village's metal factory. In October 1985, he noticed that the village planted trees every year but saw no results, as some people planted but did not care for the trees. To address this, he spent 8,000 yuan to purchase 15,000 apple tree saplings and 2,000 willow tree saplings from Shandong Province. He proposed that for any household with a tree survival rate of over 90%, he would pay their collective levies for three years. Currently, the village's young tree survival rate has reached over 95%.

　　刘洪升设奖植树
    河北  韩金泉
    河北省东光县胡集乡西塘村普通农民刘洪升，为了鼓励乡亲们多种树种好树，近三年已拿出三点六万元，替植树成活率达到百分之九十以上的九百多名村民交了提留款。刘洪升承包村里五金厂赚了钱。一九八五年十月，他看到村里年年栽树不见树，一些人管栽不管活，为此，他拿出八千元从山东买回苹果树苗一万五千棵、杨树苗二千棵，提出：谁家栽树成活率达百分之九十以上，他替谁家拿三年集体提留款。现在，村里幼树成活率达到百分之九十五以上。
