    NEW YORK, April 19 (Xinhua) — Chinese Ambassador to the United Nations Li Luye made a speech at the UN Security Council meeting today, urging "relevant parties" to fully implement the Geneva Agreement and support the efforts of the UN Secretary-General to achieve a comprehensive political solution to the Afghan problem.

    The Security Council, at the request of the Kabul government, began an emergency meeting on April 11 to discuss the current tense situation in Afghanistan. Li Luye emphasized, "Relevant parties should seriously implement the agreements that have been reached, allowing various political forces in Afghanistan to establish a broad-based coalition government through consultation without external interference."

    Li Luye finally said that since the Geneva Agreement has already stipulated appropriate mechanisms and procedures for handling allegations of violations, the Chinese delegation does not see any positive impact that the current Security Council debate on the domestic situation in Afghanistan will have.

    BEIJING, April 20 (Xinhua) — Kabul government leader Najibullah said in an interview with American and British television and radio reporters on April 19 that he hopes to hold talks with U.S. President Bush to discuss Afghan issues. He also said he is willing to resign if it helps achieve peace domestically.

    According to foreign reports, Najibullah also requested Western countries to help stop the Afghan civil war. Meanwhile, the spokesperson for the Kabul government's Foreign Ministry, Amany, criticized the U.S. House of Representatives' Asia-Pacific Subcommittee for approving a draft bill by the Bush administration to provide $105 million in non-military aid to Afghan guerrillas. He said that all aid should be channeled through the United Nations and international organizations.

    我代表敦促认真执行日内瓦协议     
    纳吉布拉希望同布什讨论阿富汗问题
    本报联合国４月１９日电  记者刘开宸报道：中国常驻联合国代表李鹿野大使今天在联合国安理会会议上发言，敦促“有关各方”完全执行日内瓦协议，用实际行动支持联合国秘书长为全面政治解决阿富汗问题而作的努力。
    安理会应喀布尔政权要求，于１１日开始召开紧急会议，讨论阿富汗目前的紧张局势问题。李鹿野强调，“有关各方应认真执行已达成的协议，让阿富汗各派政治力量在没有外来干涉的情况下，通过协商建立一个广泛基础的联合政府。”
    李鹿野最后说，由于日内瓦协议已为处理有关违反协议的指控规定了合适的机制和程序，中国代表团看不出目前安理会关于阿富汗国内局势问题的辩论会产生什么积极影响。
    新华社北京４月２０日电　喀布尔政权领导人纳吉布拉１９日在接受美国和英国电视和电台记者的采访时表示，他希望同美国总统布什举行会谈，讨论阿富汗问题。他还说，他愿意辞职，如果这一作法有利于在国内实现和平。
    据外电报道，纳吉布拉还要求西方国家帮助制止阿富汗内战。与此同时，喀布尔政权外交部发言人阿马尼批评美国众议院亚太事务小组委员会批准布什政府向阿游击队提供１．０５亿美元非军事援助的草案。他说，一切援助都应通过联合国和国际组织的渠道来进行。
