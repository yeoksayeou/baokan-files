The Meizhou Municipal Party Committee and government, in collaboration with the supervisory authorities, recently uncovered a case involving the use of deceptive means to conduct fake donations, obtaining approval documents for the tax-free import of 2.4 million tons of chemical fertilizers, and subsequently selling these documents for profit. The county head Chen Huannan and other relevant individuals have been disciplined.

According to the investigation, in October 1987, Liu Weizhang, the Party Committee Secretary of Xinwu Town in Xingning County, along with County Committee member and Office Director of the County Government, Luo Jinliang, and Administrative Group Leader Wang Qicheng, forged letters purporting to be donations of chemical fertilizers from compatriots in Hong Kong and Macau. This deception secured approval documents for the tax-free import of 2.4 million tons of chemical fertilizers. In January 1988, Luo Jinliang arranged for Liu Weizhang to go to the Shenzhen Light Industry Import and Export Company to negotiate. The two parties agreed to sell the approval documents for 20 yuan per ton. After the transaction, a total of 340,000 yuan was obtained, of which the County Government Office received 140,000 yuan, and the remaining 200,000 yuan went to Xinwu Town.

This batch of fertilizers was seized by the Huangpu Customs when it was sold at Huangpu Port.

When the Huangpu Customs sent personnel to Xingning County for investigation, County Head Chen Huannan did not pursue the truth. Luo Jinliang, Wang Qicheng, and Liu Weizhang deceptively claimed that the sale of fertilizers was for "increasing value and building public welfare projects," thereby deceiving the customs officials during the investigation.

The Meizhou Municipal Party Committee and government decided: to confiscate the illegal proceeds of 340,000 yuan from the sale of approval documents and remit them to the local treasury; to issue a formal warning to County Head Chen Huannan, who bears leadership responsibility; to dismiss Luo Jinliang, who bears primary responsibility, from all Party and government positions; and to issue a major demerit and a serious warning within the Party to Wang Qicheng and Liu Weizhang, who bear direct responsibility, respectively.

　　假捐赠　新圩镇党委书记带头行骗    
    卖批件　兴宁县政府机关参与分肥    
    广东查处一“官骗”案
    本报广州４月２４日电  记者梁兆明报道：广东省梅州市委、市政府配合监察部门，近日查获了一宗用欺骗手段搞假捐赠，骗取免税进口２．４万吨化肥的批文后又将批文倒卖牟利的案件，并对兴宁县县长陈焕南等有关人员给予处分。
    据查，１９８７年１０月，兴宁县新圩镇党委书记刘维章与县委委员、县政府办公室主任罗锦良、行政组长王启清等人，伪造港澳同胞捐赠化肥的信件，骗得免税进口化肥２．４万吨的批文。１９８８年１月，罗锦良又安排刘维章前往深圳轻工进出口公司联系，双方达成了以每吨２０元人民币倒卖批文的交易。成交后，实际得款３４万元，县政府办公室从中分得１４万元，其余２０万元为新圩镇所得。
    这批化肥在黄埔港就地销售时被黄埔海关发现查扣。
    当黄埔海关派人前往兴宁县调查时，县长陈焕南却不追问事实真相，罗锦良、王启清、刘维章诡称只是“转卖化肥增值，是用于建设公益事业”，以欺骗手段应付了海关的调查。
    梅州市委、市政府作出决定：没收倒卖批文的非法所得３４万元，上缴地方财政；对负有领导责任的县长陈焕南，给予行政警告处分；对负有主要责任的罗锦良，给予撤销党内外一切职务的处分；对负有直接责任的王启清、刘维章，分别给予行政记大过和党内严重警告处分。
