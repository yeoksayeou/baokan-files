Comrade Liu Bocheng was an outstanding revolutionary and military leader of the proletariat in our Party. From the revolutionary period's campaigns north and south, to the construction of the military after the founding of the nation, he achieved numerous great merits over decades. He commanded many famous battles in his lifetime, and his mastery of strategy and tactics was renowned and admired by both Party members and non-Party members. Comrade Zhu De said he had the "spirit of an ancient general," and this is indeed true!

I first met Comrade Liu Bocheng during the early stages of the War of Resistance. At that time, he and Comrade Deng Xiaoping led the 129th Division to the southeastern part of Shanxi to open up an anti-Japanese base. I and Comrade An Ziweng often went to the Eighth Route Army Headquarters and the North Bureau of the Communist Party of China to report on the work of the Ta-Yeh Alliance and the Suicide Squad, and these two leading bodies were then moving with the 129th Division. Therefore, we also had the opportunity to learn from Comrade Liu Bocheng. Later, I also worked under his leadership. He was 15 years older than me, a division commander, and a comrade-in-arms, and we can also be considered close friends. The memories are vivid, lingering in my heart, and I will briefly recount some fragments to commemorate Comrade Liu Bocheng. (1)

Comrade Liu Bocheng came from a humble background and participated in the National Protection and Constitutional Protection Wars led by Sun Yat-sen, gaining fame for his bravery and military prowess, becoming a renowned general in Sichuan.

After joining the revolution, he served for a long time as the Chief of Staff of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. During the anti-"encirclement" campaigns in Jinggangshan, his military thoughts often coincided with those of Comrade Mao Zedong, advocating "luring the enemy in deep" and "striking the east to attack the west," using flexible strategies and tactics to defeat the enemy. Under his command, the fourth anti-"encirclement" campaign was victorious. Later, he was criticized by Li De and removed from his position as Chief of Staff. During the Long March, he resumed his original position and assisted Comrade Mao Zedong in commanding the Red Army, making important contributions to the capture of Zunyi, the four crossings of the Jinsha River, the clever crossing of the Dadu River, and the forced crossing of the Dadu River. Therefore, his reputation as Chief of Staff was very high. At that time, society had a saying: "There are only 'two and a half' chief of staffs in China who are good at fighting." One of them was Comrade Liu Bocheng.

He indeed commanded battles to a level of ease and ingenuity. During the early stages of the War of Resistance, the Suicide First Brigade often cooperated with the 129th Division in combat. Comrade Liu Bocheng commanded a series of brilliant battles. For example, in the battle of Qiqing Village, he ambushed the enemy twice in three days, creating the miracle of "overlapping ambushes." In the battle of Shentou Ridge, he used the tactic of "attacking what must be rescued, annihilating the rescuers" with a small force to make a surprise attack on Licheng, attracting the enemy to come to the rescue, while the main force was ambushed on Shentou Ridge, annihilating the relief troops, which was also unique. Even the Japanese invaders had to admire: "The Shentou Ridge ambush battle is the first-class guerrilla tactics of China."

In 1945, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region was established, with Comrade Liu Bocheng as the commander and Comrade Deng Xiaoping as the political commissar. I was the deputy political commissar. Soon after, the famous Shangdang Campaign was organized. This battle was also very clever. First, the troops surrounded Changzhi. When Yan Xishan sent troops from Taiyuan to relieve it, Comrade Liu Bocheng immediately commanded the troops to brave the heavy rain, day and night, to reach the northwest of Tunliu, encircling and annihilating the relief troops at Laoye Mountain and Mozhen. Then, the troops returned to clean up the enemy in Changzhi City. A total of 13 divisions and 35,000 enemy troops were annihilated. This victory strongly supported Comrade Mao Zedong's negotiations with Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing.

Comrade Liu Bocheng believed that battles must be won by wisdom, focusing on the "miraculous" aspects. He said that there are three tactics in warfare: first, "bull butting," second, "horse kicking," and third, "wolf biting." These are obviously the summaries of his long-term combat experience, both vivid and practical. In the subsequent campaigns of the Liu-Deng Army's contest for the Central Plains, advancing to the Dabie Mountains, crossing the Yangtze River, and liberating Southwest China, Comrade Liu Bocheng and Comrade Deng Xiaoping used tactics more variably, always embodying the principle of winning by wisdom, always leading the enemy by the nose. A high-ranking officer of the Kuomintang once wrote in his diary: "Among all our high-ranking generals, 'there is no one whose wisdom surpasses Liu Bocheng,' his 'command is so wonderful that it is unfathomable,' 'some say Liu Bocheng commands the Ministry of Defense, which is indeed not wrong!'"

Although he was renowned throughout the country, Comrade Liu Bocheng always remained humble and modest, never boasting of his achievements. He did not consider himself a "genius" and was least willing to be called a "victorious general." His outstanding military command talents and high-level military theoretical achievements were the result of years of diligent study, hard work, careful thinking, and practical seeking. He was well-versed in ancient military strategies, and even in the midst of war, he never stopped studying military theory. He insisted on exploring in practice, and after each major battle, he would carefully summarize it to seek progress in understanding. In every study and deployment of battle plans, he would gather opinions, think repeatedly, and be very cautious. He particularly emphasized the accurate grasp of various situations and called the task, enemy situation, our situation, place, and time the "five elements," believing that if the "five elements" are not determined, one would "lose completely." He also particularly emphasized inspiring the troops to exert their creativity in practice, often saying: "Whether it's a yellow cat or a black cat, as long as it can catch mice, it's a good cat." This was originally a Sichuan proverb, meaning that in combat, no matter what tactics you use, as long as you can win the battle and annihilate the enemy, it's good. Later, Comrade Deng Xiaoping also liked to use this sentence to express his pragmatic and results-oriented thinking. I think our cadres, especially leading cadres, whether they are engaged in economic, political, military, cultural, or other work, should all strive to cultivate and continuously develop their own spirit of diligent study, hard work, careful thinking, and practical seeking. This is indispensable for doing a good job in leadership work. (2)

In October 1945, after the Shangdang Campaign ended, the Pinghan Campaign was immediately organized. Winning over Gao Qiusong to rebel was a masterpiece of Liu and Deng in this campaign. I also participated in some of the planning at that time. This matter was very significant. After this, our troops in various places widely carried out the "Gao Qiusong Movement" against the attacking Kuomintang army, playing a very important role in splitting and disintegrating the enemy forces.

Before the Pinghan Campaign, Chiang Kai-shek sent the 30th, 40th, and New 8th Divisions of the Sun Lianzheng army from Xinxiang, Henan, northward along the Pinghan Railway, intending to open the Pinghan Line and further organize attacks on our North China and Northeast bases. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong instructed the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Field Army to set up the battlefield in Handan, annihilate the enemy, and defend the southern gate. This battle was crucial to the overall situation. Comrade Liu Bocheng and Comrade Deng Xiaoping, after careful planning, decided to set up a "pocket formation" in the narrow area north of the Zhanghe River and south of Handan and on both sides of the Hongyang River, waiting for the enemy to advance northward and then strike at the right time. Comrade Liu Bocheng humorously said: "We should eat the mouse like a cat, first soften it and then eat it." First, implement "surround but do not annihilate," and there was another important consideration, that is, to strive for Gao Qiusong to rebel on the spot. Gao Qiusong was the original Northwest Army general and the deputy commander-in-chief of the 11th War Zone of the Kuomintang, commanding the New 8th Division. At that time, Comrade Wang Dingshan brought an important intelligence report, saying that Gao Qiusong was dissatisfied with Chiang Kai-shek and his cronies' marginalization and discrimination against him, expressing his willingness to contact our army. After discussion, Comrade Deng Xiaoping asked Comrade Wang Dingshan to quickly go to Gao Qiusong's division, persuading him to see the situation, think about the future, and resolutely rebel for the people. Wang left, and Comrade Liu Bocheng also instructed: "You should tell General Gao that this is the best opportunity for him to turn to revolution, and he should make a decisive decision; hesitation will lead to chaos." Comrade Wang Dingshan conveyed the message from Liu and Deng, and Gao Qiusong's attitude was good, but he was concerned about his family still in Xuzhou. Comrade Liu and Deng immediately reported to the Central Committee, and the Central Committee ordered Comrade Chen Yi to send people to bring Gao's family from Xuzhou to the liberated area, and Gao was very grateful. On October 29, Comrade Liu and Deng sent Chief of Staff Li Da to visit Gao Qiusong in the New 8th Division's station, further firming his resolve to rebel. Li Da was also an old comrade from the Northwest Army, participating in the revolution during the Ningdu Uprising in 1931. Gao Qiusong saw Li Da, and old friends met, chatting happily. Li Da encouraged him to follow the example of Feng Yuxiang's Five Originals Oath and Dong Zhenchang and Zhao Boshen's Ningdu Uprising. Gao immediately said: "Rebel on October 30."

On October 31, the headquarters decided that Comrade Deng Xiaoping and Chief of Staff Li Da would command the frontline battle, and Comrade Liu Bocheng and I would go to Mazhu Town to meet with Gao Qiusong. I remember that Comrades Zhu Muzi and An Gang, responsible for Xinhua News Agency and Xinhua Daily, also went with us. Comrade Liu Bocheng first conveyed the telegram from Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Zhu De to General Gao Qiusong, highly praising his raising the banner of justice, opposing civil war, and advocating peace, and expressing welcome and greetings to him and his troops. Gao Qiusong was very moved and said: "I am grateful for the love of Comrade Zhu De, Comrade Mao Zedong, and General Liu, and I will not hesitate to die for the people." Comrade Liu Bocheng asked him if there was anything else he needed our help with? He hesitated for a moment and said: "The 40th Division Commander Ma Fawu and the 30th Division Commander Lu Chongyi, who advanced north with me, were all old comrades from the Northwest Army. I hope that after the New 8th Division rebels, we will not fight them." Considering that Comrade Liu Bocheng was not convenient to reply, I answered from the side: "This is a battle between two armies. If we do not fight them, they will also fight us. We cannot talk about 'friendship.' For those who do not lay down their weapons, we will not be lenient. This matter still asks General Gao to understand and give his support."

After the news of Gao Qiusong's rebellion was announced, Kuomintang generals such as Ma Fawu and Lu Chongyi were extremely shocked and at a loss. Our army took the opportunity to launch a fierce attack. On November 2, 23,000 enemy troops were annihilated, and high-ranking officers such as Ma Fawu were captured. Subsequently, Gao Qiusong led the New 8th Division to Wuan County for reorganization, establishing the "Democratic National Construction Army," and the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China appointed him as the commander. (3)

Comrade Liu Bocheng attached great importance to political work in the army. He often said that the army must absolutely obey the leadership of the Party; if it does not obey the leadership of the Party, it will slide onto the path of militarism. I remember that in a report, he once explained the importance of political work in this way: The factors of victory and defeat in war are not entirely military equipment and technology, but to a great extent, it is the degree of combination of political power and technical power. The warlords' weapons are good, and some military technology is also high, but they were still defeated by us. Why? Because they did not and could not have our political work and political power. What was our original strength? The predecessor of the 129th Division was the Fourth Front Army, which started with a single stick gun. The 120th Division was pulled out from Xianghuai, starting with two kitchen knives. The 115th Division developed after the Nanchang Uprising and the Autumn Harvest Uprising. Stick guns and kitchen knives defeated machine guns and mortars, was it not because we had a strong political power? If the Communist Party did not have political advantages and did not gain the support of the masses, it would not have strong cohesion and would achieve nothing. These words, although said decades ago, still seem meaningful today.

Comrade Liu Bocheng respected the political commissar and all political workers. He not only did this himself but also required the commanders of all columns to respect their own political commissars and respect those who do political work. He and Comrade Deng Xiaoping worked together for many years, and in their work, they always discussed and supported each other, cooperating very harmoniously. Before making the final decision in every military meeting to discuss battle plans, Comrade Liu Bocheng would always ask Comrade Deng Xiaoping for his opinion and often announced at the end of the meeting: "We will do it according to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's opinion." Comrade Deng Xiaoping also respected and cared for Comrade Liu Bocheng very much. Their unity and sincere friendship have been praised within the Party and the army for a long time. In December 1942, on Comrade Liu Bocheng's 50th birthday, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said in his congratulatory words: "We live and work together. Our feelings are very harmonious, and our working relationship is very coordinated. We sometimes have disagreements, but we never insist on our own opinions. Whose opinion is more correct, we will do it together. We often hear that some comrades quarrel with their superiors, subordinates, and peers, always think they are right and others are wrong, always want to suppress others and elevate themselves, always want to show off and be the king, resulting in mistakes and harming the Party and the cause. If these comrades start from the interests of the country, the people, and the Party, rather than from personal honor and status, how would they make such mistakes? Comrade Liu Bocheng is always persuading and educating comrades with such a spirit." Comrade Deng Xiaoping's words, I remember that when I read them for the first time, I was deeply moved; now, re-reading them, I feel that they are still fresh and meaningful.

Here, I would like to insert a conversation between Comrade Zhou Enlai and me. It was during the Seventh Plenum of the Seventh Central Committee in 1950. One day, during a casual chat, Comrade Zhou Enlai thoughtfully asked me: "You have worked with Comrade Liu Bocheng and Comrade Deng Xiaoping in Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu for many years. How do you view their work?" I said: "They cooperate very well in their work and are indeed united and harmonious." He shook his head and said: "I am not talking about their cooperation but asking for your opinion on their work methods." Without thinking, I asked back: "Premier, you are an old leader and have known them for a long time. What do you think?" He smiled and said: "Good! You have returned the question to me." I also smiled and said: "Isn't it said that 'the one who ties the bell should untie it'? We call this 'the one who asks the question should answer it.'" Comrade Zhou Enlai said: "From my long observation, their two work methods are different. Comrade Deng Xiaoping is 'light as a feather,' while Comrade Liu Bocheng is 'heavy as a mountain.' Do you think so?" I said: "I completely agree with the Premier's evaluation. These eight words are very accurate. They can cooperate so well in their work, perhaps this is an important factor." Then, Comrade Zhou Enlai asked me: "So, which of these two work methods do you prefer?" Before I could answer, he began to express his opinion: "From my wish, I admire Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 'light as a feather,' but to be honest, I cannot do this. I am like Comrade Liu Bocheng, often 'heavy as a mountain' in my work. This may be related to my long-term responsibility for specific execution work." Later, I often recalled Comrade Zhou Enlai's conversation with me. I often thought that for a leading cadre to simultaneously possess these two work methods is indeed not easy. However, from the perspective of the Party's work and a leading cadre's work, it is necessary to have both, and neither can be lacking. (4)

The Seventh National Congress of the Party was a famous conference of unity in our Party's history. The democratic, united, and harmonious atmosphere is still fresh in my memory. On the eve of leaving Yan'an, Comrade Mao Zedong asked Comrade Ren Bishi and me to talk, hoping that after I returned to the troops, I would insist on starting from the line of unity and victory of the Seventh Congress, doing more work to unite the troops. I immediately expressed to him that with the guidance of Comrade Liu Bocheng and Comrade Deng Xiaoping, I had the confidence to do a good job in this work.

In insisting on unity, Comrade Liu Bocheng and Comrade Deng Xiaoping were both exemplary and leading by example. Comrade Liu Bocheng often said: "Revolutionary unity is related to the survival of the revolution. The more united, the more vigorous the morale, the more prosperous the cause. This is a political common sense that must not be forgotten for a moment." Everyone who has worked with Comrade Liu Bocheng feels that he has a broad mind and the attitude of embracing all rivers and streams.

The 129th Division was formed by integrating the Fourth Front Army with part of the First Front Army and the Shaanxi Red Army. Comrade Liu Bocheng paid great attention to unity within the army, especially to uniting the cadres and soldiers of the original Fourth Front Army. He emphasized: "The setbacks suffered by the Fourth Front Army during the Long March were the responsibility of Zhang Guotao and his erroneous line. As for the broad cadres and soldiers of the Fourth Front Army, they have all gone through hardships and trials, and their revolution is firm. We must especially respect and unite them. We cannot look down on them just because Zhang Guotao had problems. The practice of one person's mistake leading to the involvement of many, or one person's success leading to the elevation of many, or forming cliques and discriminating against those who are not in the same faction, is not the practice of communists but the political trickery of the feudal court. In the revolutionary ranks, at any time, we must not be infected with this feudal poison, otherwise, the harm will be deep, and the consequences will be worrying." His words were highly praised by everyone. Whether the original cadres and soldiers were from the First Front Army, the Fourth Front Army, or the Shaanxi Red Army, Comrade Liu Bocheng treated them equally. When there were disputes and lack of unity, he always first criticized the comrades from the original First Front Army. In the use of cadres, he and Comrade Deng Xiaoping also paid great attention to promoting and using the cadres from the original Fourth Front Army. Such as Chen Xilian, Xie Fuzhi, Wang Xinting, and others who served as division commanders, were all cadres from the original Fourth Front Army. When I first came to the 129th Division, Comrade Liu Bocheng and Comrade Deng Xiaoping told me: "Don't look down on the cadres of the Fourth Front Army, most of whom are workers and peasants with low cultural level, but they fight like dragons and tigers. They instructed me to recognize and grasp this characteristic, pay more attention to cultivating and using these cadres."

In early 1940, the Suicide First Brigade was officially integrated into the combat sequence of the 129th Division, forming the Taihang Column with the 386th Brigade. Comrade Chen Geng served as the column commander, and I served as the political commissar. Comrade Liu Bocheng and Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out many times: "The 386th Brigade has more Red Army soldiers and combat experience, and the Suicide First Brigade has more intellectuals and high cultural level, which can complement each other and exchange experiences. Intellectuals temporarily lack combat experience, which is not a problem. After a few battles, they will have experience, and they should be boldly promoted to be cadres." After the Shangdang Campaign, Comrade Liu Bocheng once talked to me: "This battle was very good. The soldiers said that after crossing one ridge, they crossed another ridge, fighting very happily. From this, it can be seen that the combat style of the Suicide Squad, including many intellectuals, has been cultivated." I said: "Some people say that Shanxi soldiers are weak and cannot fight." He said: "Who said that? Whether they can fight or not, the key is in the leadership." Comrade Liu Bocheng and Comrade Deng Xiaoping attached such importance to unity and the use of intellectuals, not only because they themselves were great intellectuals, but more importantly, they deeply understood the importance of intellectuals in achieving revolutionary victory. Since ancient times, the world can be obtained by horse, but it cannot be governed by horse. After obtaining the world and turning to economic construction, one should more respect knowledge and intellectuals, but in this regard, our lessons are too profound.

Comrade Liu Bocheng also attached great importance to military-civilian unity. I remember that after the victory of the Pinghan Campaign, a guard platoon leader had a dispute with a militia leader from his hometown, almost to the point of drawing swords. Comrade Liu Bocheng learned of this and immediately sent people to mediate, helping them realize their mistakes, and through this incident, carried out extensive unity education in the troops. Comrade Liu Bocheng also told everyone the story of "Ministers and Generals in Harmony." He said: "During the Warring States period, Handan was the capital of the State of Zhao. The prime minister Lin Xiangru and the general Lian Po once had a dispute, and the people were worried because at that time, the State of Qin was eyeing Zhao. But the old general Lian Po quickly realized his mistake and apologized to Lin Xiangru with a bundle of thorns, and the two became friends again, working together for the country. Why has this story been popular for thousands of years and praised as a beautiful story? It is because it advocates the importance of unity." Comrade Liu Bocheng also asked us to organize cadres to visit the site of Huichuan Alley in Handan City and let literary and artistic workers write and perform the Peking opera "Ministers and Generals in Harmony," all for the purpose of better strengthening the unity of the army and military-civilian unity. (5)

Comrade Liu Bocheng was open-minded, had a sharp wit, and his language was witty and humorous. This is related to his extensive experience and rich knowledge. Therefore, everyone was willing to listen to him speak.

He grew up in a rural area since childhood, familiar with Sichuan's folk language and dialects. When he explained some important principles in military and political work, he often quoted them. For example, he used "five fingers pressing five fleas, none can be caught" to explain why to concentrate superior forces to annihilate the enemy, used "mosquito biting Buddha" and "dog carrying a pot in chaos" to explain the blind behavior of not paying attention to understanding the enemy situation in combat, and used "sawing a ship's mast into a horse-tethering post" to describe the improper use of cadres, etc., making people feel easy to understand, shallow but profound, vivid and unforgettable. I think Comrade Liu Bocheng's style of speaking and writing is very worth learning. It has no bookishness and no eight-legged style. If one speaks or writes, deliberately making it profound, creating concepts, playing with words, making it obscure and difficult to understand, such a style of writing, even if it can be popular for a while, will definitely not have vitality. Unfortunately, this kind of thing is still not extinct, and even has the trend of becoming more and more rampant. Why is this so? It is worth reflecting on.

Comrade Liu Bocheng liked to tell stories and jokes, and often used humor to convey profound meanings, so he often made people reflect deeply in laughter. I remember once, he recounted an incident from the early days of the War of Resistance when he participated in a banquet held by the Kuomintang's First War Zone Commander-in-Chief Wei Lihuang in Luoyang. He said: "The Kuomintang has a 'rule' that whenever 'Chairman Chiang' is mentioned in a speech, everyone present must stand up to show respect. After Commander Wei's speech, when I mentioned 'Chairman Chiang' several times in my speech, the Kuomintang officers indeed 'stood up when they heard Chiang,' resulting in standing up and sitting down, sitting down and standing up, and even forgetting to pick up their chopsticks." Comrade Liu Bocheng recounted the story while describing it, and everyone listened and laughed heartily. But he himself remained calm and continued: "This is indeed close to a joke, but it reflects the superior-subordinate relationship in the Kuomintang. Those officers, although they outwardly obeyed their 'Chairman' with all their might, were they not just 'carrying a pole and acting on the stage'? If their superiors and subordinates were truly 'sincerely united,' why did they always lose battles? They called Chiang Kai-shek 'Chairman,' but what kind of chairman! He was just high above, but wanted to decide everything. How could he not make mistakes everywhere?"

Another time, Comrade Liu Bocheng talked about strengthening discipline and told this joke. He said: "I don't remember which book wrote about three scholars who came to a white wall with a sign that said 'Do not draw on this wall.' So they started discussing. One scholar said, 'Not allowed to draw? We will draw!' The second one said, 'You draw, and I will draw too!' The third one said, 'If you draw, I will draw too!' As a result, everyone showed their skills, and the white wall was no longer white." Obviously, Comrade Liu Bocheng was using this to depict those who disregard revolutionary discipline and deliberately violate it. Even today, in our real life, this story has not lost its satirical meaning. Those who seek personal gain, those so-called 'speculators,' are their behavior not somewhat similar to these three scholars? They disregard Party discipline and national laws, see profit and forget righteousness, compete with each other, and compare with each other, 'you seek (personal gain) and I seek (personal gain),' 'you speculate and I speculate,' many bad winds are blown up like this.

Comrade Liu Bocheng read a lot of books, not only Marxist books but also often read some historical works. It was probably during the early days of the founding of the nation. Once he asked me if I had read Zeng Guofan's "Family Letters." I said I had read it in my early years. Then he talked about his views: "This 'Zeng Wenzheng,' although his person is not to be emulated, we should not discard his words because of his person. His 'Family Letters' are not all the views of a pedantic scholar, and some of his views, I think, are still worth learning from. For example, he wrote many letters to his younger brother Zeng Guoqian, who was then in charge of Nanjing, already a general of ten thousand troops. Zeng Guofan advised him in the letters to be patient, to be calm and composed, and to think more; another point was to advise him to pay attention to selecting 'replacements' early, saying 'those who do great things, regard selecting replacements as the first priority.' I interjected: 'Zeng Guofan's two points, as a method of governing the army and the country, are not without reason.' Comrade Liu Bocheng said: 'Regarding the selection of 'replacements,' or 'assistants,' every leader has this task. However, to do it, to select the 'replacements' correctly, the difficulty is not small, because people do not know themselves, and it is also difficult to know others. Therefore, two points should be particularly noted: first, to select carefully and appoint cautiously, neither to employ mediocre talents to fill the gaps nor to let cunning people take advantage of the situation, but to make the selected ones have both virtue and talent. 'Virtue is the leader of talent, and talent is the proof of virtue,' both are indispensable; second, for 'replacements,' leaders should of course trust them, let them work freely, and listen to their opinions and suggestions, but for their opinions and suggestions, choose the good ones and discard the bad ones, and do not listen to them all. Otherwise, it may lead to overstepping one's authority, and although it is called 'replacement,' it actually becomes the 'helmsman.' Such phenomena are not rare in history." Comrade Liu Bocheng's views, I think, are sincere and thought-provoking. (6)

There are two more things that I have always remembered. One is Comrade Liu Bocheng visiting my mother, and the other is Comrade Liu Bocheng scolding his son. These two things, although seemingly ordinary, can reveal a lot, and they are clear in their love and hatred.

At the end of 1939, Yan Xishan launched the "December Incident," and the situation suddenly became tense. At that time, I and my mother were living in Yanzhai Village, Shanyin County. One day, Comrade Liu Bocheng and Comrade Deng Xiaoping personally came to Yanzhai, not only to discuss with me how to counter Yan Xishan's attack and the merger of the Suicide First Brigade with the 386th Brigade but also to visit my mother. Unfortunately, I was not at home that day. Later, my mother told me that two guests came, who seemed to be important figures, and as soon as they entered the door, they asked "Auntie, are you well?" and bowed deeply to her. My mother also said: "One of them, the older one, looked no younger than me, also called me 'Auntie.' They asked this and that, and also laughed and talked, telling me not to worry too much about you, and take good care of your health, which was very kind. From their accents, they seemed to be from Sichuan." I have poor legs and cannot get up to greet them, nor did I entertain them, which I feel very guilty. I told my mother: "They are my superiors, the older one is surnamed Liu, and the younger one is surnamed Deng, both are from the 129th Division, one is the division commander, and the other is the political commissar, who are the 'Liu-Deng leaders' I have mentioned to you before." She was moved and said: "So it was them! You should apologize to them on my behalf, saying that I am old and useless, and I am sorry for not greeting them." I conveyed my mother's intentions to Comrade Liu Bocheng, saying that the old lady was very grateful for your visit and has been remembering this matter. Comrade Liu Bocheng smiled and said: "I think Auntie's courtesy is too heavy. She is virtuous and wise, and we went to visit her, which is completely appropriate. Confucius said, 'Respect the elderly in your family, and then respect the elderly in others' families.' Respecting the elderly and honoring the virtuous is a traditional virtue of the Chinese nation, which has lasted for thousands of years and will not fade away. We communists should of course take the lead in observing and carrying forward this tradition. If I do not do well in this regard, please remind and criticize me more." I remember that at that time, many comrades often visited my mother, such as Teng Daiyuan, Bi Zhanwen, and many others. Although it was in a war environment, the conditions were very harsh, but there was mutual care and respect between superiors and subordinates, old and young, and comrades, and everywhere was filled with friendly feelings. From this, I thought of a problem. It can be said that since the founding of our Party, there have always been such arguments, as if communists only talk about revolution, only know how to wage class struggle, and do not talk about humanity, do not understand human feelings, and do not want humanitarianism. In fact, this is completely inconsistent with the facts. No matter where these arguments come from or which side they come from, they are all either ignorant or absurd nonsense.

Regarding the matter of Comrade Liu Bocheng scolding his son, I remember that it was also during the "December Incident" that I heard him talk about it. The incident happened after the "August 1st" Nanchang Uprising. Comrade Liu Bocheng went to Shanghai via Hong Kong and later went to the Soviet Union. Soon after he arrived in Shanghai, a son born in his hometown found his residence, and at the same time, he brought a woman dressed in fancy clothes. Comrade Liu Bocheng had long known of his son's misconduct and immediately became alert, asking about his intentions. The other party said: "I am going to get married and need some money, hoping to help as much as possible." Comrade Liu Bocheng said, "First, I am not an official, nor a wealthy merchant, but a revolutionary who has been on the battlefield for years, with no savings, that's one; second, even if I had money, I would not give it to you. You have already grown up and should walk the right path and support yourself, instead of indulging in pleasure and relying on others' patronage, which would harm yourself." His son heard this and said angrily: "Alright, let's see!" and then left in a huff. Comrade Liu Bocheng told his wife: "This guy will definitely go to inform the enemy, and we must move immediately." As expected, the enemy came soon, but found nothing. This incident not only shows Comrade Liu Bocheng's extraordinary vigilance but also fully demonstrates his revolutionary spirit of righteousness.

Comrade Liu Bocheng, although he has long passed away, his revolutionary spirit will coexist with the nation's civilization and the people's wisdom, and his brilliant achievements will coexist with the development of history and the progress of the motherland.

We and our future generations will continue to draw strength from his spirit and achievements, striving forward for the rejuvenation of China and the realization of the Four Modernizations.

    刘伯承同志是我党杰出的无产阶级革命家和军事家，从革命时期的南征北战，到建国后的军队建设，数十年中，屡建殊勋。他一生指挥过许多著名战役，他的精通韬略，足智多谋，为党内外共瞩同钦。朱德同志说他有“古名将风”，斯言信矣！
    我认识伯承同志已是到抗战初期了。那时，他和邓小平同志率领一二九师，来到晋东南开辟抗日根据地。我和安子文同志常去八路军总部和中共中央北方局汇报牺盟会、决死队的工作，而这两个领导机关当时都随一二九师行动，因此，也少不了就教于伯承同志。以后，我还在他的领导下工作过。他比我年长15岁，是师长，又是战友，还可谓忘年交。往事历历，萦绕胸次，今略述片断，以志对伯承同志的纪念。（一）
    伯承同志出身贫寒，参加过孙中山领导的护国、护法战争，以骁勇善战而声闻遐迩，成为川中名将。
    他参加革命以后，长时间担任中国工农红军总参谋长。在井冈山反“围剿”斗争中，他与毛泽东同志的军事思想常常不谋而合，主张“诱敌深入”、“声东击西”，运用灵活的战略战术消灭敌人。在他的参与指挥下，取得了第四次反“围剿”的胜利。后遭李德的打击，被撤销总参谋长职务。长征中，他恢复了原职，协助毛泽东同志指挥红军，为智取遵义、四渡赤水、巧渡金沙江、强渡大渡河，作出了重要贡献。因此，他这个总参谋长的名气很大。当时社会上曾流传这样一个说法：中国最会打仗的参谋长只有“两个半”。其中的一个，就是伯承同志。
    他指挥打仗，确实到了用兵自如、神奇巧妙的境界。抗战前期，决死一纵队经常配合一二九师作战，伯承同志指挥了一系列漂亮的战斗。比如，在七亘村战斗中，三天之内伏击敌人两次，创造了“重叠伏击”的奇迹。在神头岭战斗中，他运用“攻其所必救，歼其救者”的战术，以小股力量奇袭黎城，吸引敌人来援，而以大部兵力埋伏于神头岭上，痛歼援兵，也是别出心裁的。连日本侵略者也不得不惊叹：神头岭伏击战是“支那第一流游击战术”。
    1945年成立晋冀鲁豫军区，伯承同志担任司令员，小平同志任政委，我是副政委。不久，组织了有名的上党战役。这一仗也打得很巧妙。先是兵围长治，当阎锡山从太原出兵驰援时，伯承同志立即指挥部队冒着倾盆大雨，日夜兼程，赶到屯留西北，将援敌合围、歼击于老爷山和磨盘地区，然后回师收拾长治城内之敌。共歼敌13个师、3.5万余人。这一战役的胜利，有力地支援了毛泽东同志在重庆与蒋介石的谈判。
    伯承同志认为，打仗必须以智取胜，多在“神奇”二字上下功夫。他说，作战有三种战术：一是“牛抵角”，二是“马踢脚”，三是“狼咬人”。显然，这些都是他长期作战经验的总结，既形象通俗而又实际。在后来刘、邓大军逐鹿中原、挺进大别山、渡江作战、解放大西南的诸多战役中，伯承、小平同志对战术的运用更加变幻无穷，处处体现了以智取胜的用兵原则，始终牵着敌人的鼻子走。国民党的一个高级军官曾在日记中这样写道：在我们所有的高级将领中，“其才识无有能超过刘伯承者”，他“指挥之妙，令人莫测高深”，“有人谓刘伯承指挥国防部，信然不谬！”
    虽为通国闻人，但伯承同志始终虚心自持，谦以率下。功劳再大，也从不自诩。他不认为自己是“天才”，也最不愿别人称他为“常胜将军”。他卓越的军事指挥才能和高超的军事理论造诣，是多年的勤学、苦索、慎思、求实的结晶。他熟谙历代兵法，即使在戎马倥偬之中，也从未间断对军事理论的研究。他坚持在实践中探索，每个大的战役后，都要悉心总结，以求认识上有所臻进。在每次作战方案的研究和部署中，他集纳群言，反复思考，慎之又慎。他特别重视对各方面情况的准确掌握，并把任务、敌情、我情、地点、时间称之为“五行”，认为“五行”不定，就会“输得干干净净”。他还特别注意激励部队在实践中发挥创造性，常说：“不管黄猫、黑猫，能逮住老鼠就是好猫”。这原是四川的一句谚语，意思是在作战中不管你采用什么战术，只要能打胜仗，消灭敌人，就是好的。后来，小平同志也爱借用这句话来表达他的实事求是、讲求实效的思想。我觉得我们的干部，尤其是领导干部，不管是搞经济、政治、军事、文化或其他工作的，都应像伯承同志那样，努力培养并不断发展自己的勤学、苦索、慎思、求实的精神素质。这是做好领导工作必不可少的。（二）
    1945年10月，上党战役结束后，随即组织了平汉战役。争取高树勋起义，是这一战役中刘、邓的一个杰作。我当时也参与了其中的一些筹划。此事意义甚大，从这以后我军各部对进攻的国民党军队广泛开展了“高树勋运动”，对分化、瓦解敌军起了很重要的作用。
    平汉战役前，蒋介石派孙连仲部的三十军、四十军和新八军从河南新乡出发，沿平汉路北上，意欲打通平汉线，并进一步组织对我华北、东北根据地的进攻。党中央和毛泽东同志指示晋冀鲁豫野战军在邯郸摆开战场，消灭敌人，守卫南大门。此战关系全局。伯承、小平同志经过紧张谋划，决定在漳河以北和邯郸以南及滏阳河两岸的狭窄地带布下“口袋阵”，待敌北进钻入之后，再相机打击。伯承同志风趣地说：要像猫吃老鼠那样，先把它盘软了再吃。先实行“围而不歼”，还有一个重要考虑，就是要力争高树勋就地起义。高树勋是原西北军将领、国民党第十一战区副司令长官兼新八军军长。当时，王定南同志送来一个重要情报，说高树勋不满于蒋介石及其亲信对他的排挤和歧视，表示愿同我军取得联系。经研究，小平同志要王定南同志速往高树勋部，劝他认清形势，瞻念前途，毅然举行起义，为人民作出贡献。王临行时，伯承同志又叮嘱说，你要向高将军说明，这是他走向革命的最好时机，要当机立断；当断不断，反受其乱。王定南同志把刘、邓的口信转达以后，高树勋的态度很好，只是顾虑家眷还在徐州。刘、邓当即请示中央，中央电令陈毅同志派人把高的家眷从徐州接出来送到了解放区，高感激不已。10月29日，刘、邓又派参谋长李达同志进入新八军驻地看望高树勋，进一步坚定他起义的决心。李达同志也曾是西北军的旧人，1931年宁都起义时参加革命。高树勋见到李达，故人相逢，交谈甚欢。李达同志鼓励他效法冯玉祥的五原誓师和董振堂、赵博生的宁都起义。高当即表示：“10月30日宣布起义”。
    10月31日，司令部商定，由小平、李达同志指挥前线作战，伯承同志和我到马头镇与高树勋会晤。记得同行的还有新华社、新华日报的负责人朱穆之、安岗等同志。伯承同志首先向高树勋将军转达了毛泽东、朱德同志的来电，对他高举义旗、反对内战、主张和平的正义行动给予高度评价，并向他本人及所部将士表示欢迎和慰问。高树勋非常激动，说道：承蒙朱德、毛泽东先生和刘将军如此错爱，我将万死而不辞。伯承同志问他，不知高将军还有什么问题需要我们帮助解决？他迟疑了一会说：这次和我一同北上的四十军军长马法五、三十军军长鲁崇义，过去都是西北军同仁，希望新八军起义后，不要再打他们。考虑到伯承同志不便回复，我就从旁作答：这是两军交战，我们不打他们，他们也要打我们的，讲不得“朋友义气”。对于不肯放下武器的顽固分子，我们绝不宽贷。此事尚祈高将军明察，并请给予理解。
    高树勋起义的消息公布后，马法五、鲁崇义等国民党将领异常震惊，不知所措。我军趁势发起猛攻。于11月2日全歼敌人2.3万余人，马法五等高级将领被俘。随后，高树勋率新八军到武安县进行整编，成立“民主建国军”，中共中央军事委员会任命他为司令员。（三）
    伯承同志非常重视军队的政治工作。他常讲，军队必须绝对服从党的领导，如果不服从党的领导，就会滑到军阀主义道路上去。记得他在一次报告中，曾经对政治工作的重要性作过这样的阐述：战争胜负的因素，不完全是军事装备和技术，很大程度上，还在于政治力量与技术力量的结合程度。军阀们的武器很好，有的军事技术也很高，但他们还是被我们打垮了。为什么？就因为他们没有也不可能有我们这样的政治工作和政治力量。我们原来是个什么家底呢？一二九师的前身是红四方面军，靠一枝拐子枪起的家。一二○师是从湘鄂西拉出来的，是两把菜刀起家的。一一五师是南昌起义、秋收起义后发展起来的。拐子枪、菜刀战胜了机关枪、迫击炮，还不就是因为我们有强大的政治力量。共产党如果没有政治优势，得不到群众的拥护，就不会有强大的凝聚力，就会一事无成。这些话虽然是几十年前说的，今天仍觉言之谆谆，意义犹深。
    伯承同志对政委，对所有政治工作人员，都是很尊重的。他不但自己这样做，还要求各纵队的司令员都要尊重自己的政委，尊重做政治工作的同志。他和小平同志共事多年，工作中始终是互相切磋，互相支持，配合得十分默契。每次召开军事会议，讨论作战方案，在最后下决心以前，伯承同志都要请小平同志发表意见，并且常常在会议结束时宣布：就按小平同志的意见办。小平同志对伯承同志也是非常尊重和关怀的。他们的团结合作和真挚友情，在党内、军内一直传为佳话。1942年12月，在伯承同志五十寿辰时，小平同志在祝词中曾这样说过：“我们生活在一块，工作在一块。我们之间感情是很融洽的，工作关系是非常协调的。我们偶尔也有争论，但从来没有哪个固执己见。哪个意见比较对，就一致做去。我们每每听到某些同志对上下，对同级发生意气之争，遇事总以为自己对，人家不对，总想压倒别人，提高自己，一味逞英雄，充山大王，结果弄出错误，害党误事。假如这些同志以国家、人民和党的利益为出发点，而不以个人荣誉、地位为出发点，那又怎么会犯这样的错误呢？伯承同志便是不断以这样的精神去说服教育同志的。”小平同志的这番话，记得当年阅读时，就曾感思殊深；如今重温，更觉历久弥新。
    这里，我还想插述一段周恩来同志和我的谈话。那是在1950年的七届三中全会期间。一天在闲聊中，恩来同志若有所思地问我：你在晋冀鲁豫与伯承、小平共事多年，你对他们二位的工作怎么看？我说：他们在工作上配合得很好，确实是同心同德，和协有致。他摇摇头说：我不是讲他们的配合，而是问你对他们的工作方法有什么看法。我未假思索地反问道：总理，您是老领导了，又与他们相识甚早，您看呢？他爽然一笑：好啊！你又把问题原样奉还了。我也笑了：不是说“解铃还需系铃人”吗？我们这叫“解问还需提问人”嘛！恩来同志说：据我多年观察，他们两人的工作方法各有特色，小平同志是“举重若轻”，伯承同志则是“举轻若重”。你看是不是这样？我说：完全同意总理的评价，这八个字概括得很准确。他们在工作上所以配合得那样得心应手，恐怕这是一个重要因素。接着，恩来同志又问我：那么，这两种工作方法你比较喜欢哪一种？未等我作答，他就讲开了自己的看法：从愿望上说，我更欣赏小平同志的“举重若轻”，但说实在话，我这个人做不到这一点。我同伯承同志一样，在工作上常常是“举轻若重”。这也许同我长期是负责具体的执行工作有关。后来，我不时忆起恩来同志这次和我的谈话。我常想，一个领导干部要同时兼具这两种工
  作方法，的确很不容易。但是从党的工作、一个领导班子的工
  作来说，却是必须同时具有，缺一不可的。（四）党的七大是我们党的历史上有名的团结盛会。那种民主、团结、和谐的气氛，至今记忆犹新。在离开延安的前夕，毛泽东同志要任弼时同志和我谈过一次话，希望我回到部队以后，坚持从七大团结胜利的路线出发，多做部队的团结工作。我当即向他表示，有伯承、小平同志他们的合作与指导，我有信心做好这个工作。
    在坚持团结方面，伯承同志和小平同志都是处处以身作则，率先垂范的。伯承同志常常说：革命的团结关系革命的存亡。团结愈固，则士气愈壮，事业愈兴。这是个政治常识，须臾不可忘记。凡是同伯承同志相处过的人，都觉得他胸怀豁达，有海纳百川的气度。
    一二九师是以红四方面军为基础，加上红一方面军和陕北红军的一部分改编而成的。伯承同志非常注意搞好军队内部的团结，尤其注意团结好原四方面军的干部、战士。他强调指出：长征途中四方面军遭受的挫折，责任在张国焘及其错误路线。至于四方面军的广大干部、战士，都是经过了千辛万苦的考验，革命是坚定的，对他们要特别尊重和团结。不能因为张国焘出了问题，就对他们另眼相看。那种一人有错，株连一片，或者一人得道，鸡犬升天，或者拉山头，搞宗派，党同伐异，绝不是我们共产党人的做法，而是封建官场的政治权术。在革命的队伍里，任何时候都不能沾染这种封建毒素，否则，贻害必深，后果堪虞。他的这些话，是深得大家赞赏的。无论原来是一方面军还是四方面军和陕北红军的干部、战士，伯承同志都一视同仁。在发生一些争执和不团结现象时，他总是首先批评原一方面军的同志。在使用干部问题上，他和小平同志也十分注意提拔、任用原四方面军的同志。如担任纵队司令员的陈锡联、谢富治、王新廷等，都是原四方面军的干部。我初到一二九师时，伯承、小平同志就对我讲过：你别看四方面军的同志大多是工农干部，文化水平不高，但他们打起仗来生龙活虎。他们嘱咐我要认识和掌握这个特点，多注意培养、使用这些干部。
    1940年初，决死一纵队正式编入一二九师战斗序列，与三八六旅组成太岳纵队。陈赓同志任纵队司令员，我任政委。伯承、小平同志多次指出：三八六旅红军战士多，作战有经验，决死一纵队的知识分子多，文化水平高，可以取长补短，互相交流。知识分子暂时缺乏战斗经验，这不要紧，打上几仗就会有经验了，应大胆提拔他们当干部。上党战役后，伯承同志曾同我谈过：这一仗打得很好，战士们说过了一个圪梁再过一个圪梁，打得非常痛快。从中可以看出决死队的指战员，包括不少知识分子在内，他们的战斗作风已经培养起来了。我说：有人说山西兵比较弱，不会打仗。他说：谁说的？会不会打仗，关键在领导。伯承、小平同志那样注重团结、使用知识分子，不仅仅因为他们自己是大知识分子，更主要的是他们深知知识分子对于取得革命胜利的重要性。自古以来，天下可以马上得之，但不能马上治之。得了天下转入经济建设以后，本应更加尊重知识和知识分子，但是，在这方面我们的教训是太深刻了。
    伯承同志对于军民团结也非常重视。记得在平汉战役取得胜利后，有一个警卫排长与他家乡的一位民兵队长发生纠纷，几乎闹到要动刀动枪的地步。伯承同志得知后，立即派人进行调解，帮助他们认识自己的错误，并通过此事在部队中广泛开展团结教育。伯承同志还给大家讲了“将相和”的故事。他说：战国时期，邯郸是赵国的都城，赵国宰相蔺相如和大将军廉颇一度失和，国人为之忧虑，因为当时秦国正对赵国虎视眈眈。但老将廉颇很快认识了错误，并向蔺相如负荆请罪，两人又和好如初，同心报国。这个故事为什么几千年一直脍炙人口、传为美谈呢？就因为它宣传了团结的重要性。伯承同志还要我们组织干部到邯郸城里的回车巷遗址参观，并让文艺工作者编写和演出《将相和》的京剧，目的都是为了更好地加强军队团结和军民团结。（五）
    伯承同志为人达观，谈锋甚健，而且语言风趣、幽默。这同他的阅历之广、知识之富不无关系。正因为如此，大家都很愿意听他讲话。
    他自幼生长在农村，熟悉四川民间的俚语方言，他在阐述军事、政治工作中的一些重要道理时，常常加以引用。比如，他用“五个指头按五个跳蚤，一个也抓不着”，来说明为什么要集中优势兵力消灭敌人，用“蚊子叮菩萨”、“狗带沙锅乱碰”，来说明打仗不注意了解敌情而造成的盲目行为，用“船桅杆锯作拴马桩”，来形容对干部的使用不当等等，使人一听就觉得通俗易懂，深入浅出，形象生动，经久不忘。伯承同志的这种话风、文风，我以为很值得学习。它没有书卷气，也无八股味。如果讲话、作文，故作高深，滥造概念，游戏文字，弄得晦涩难懂，那样的文风即使有时也可风靡一阵，但毕竟是不会有生命力的。遗憾的是这类东西，眼下还远未绝迹，甚至还有愈演愈烈之势，缘何至此，倒是很可以反思一下的。
    伯承同志喜欢讲故事和笑话，并且寓庄于谐，含义深刻，因而往往能于笑哂之中，发人深省。记得有一次，他讲述了抗战初期参加国民党第一战区司令长官卫立煌在洛阳举行的一次宴会上的见闻。他说：国民党有个“规矩”，凡是讲话中讲到“蒋委员长”时，在座的人必须起立，以示尊崇。在卫长官致词后，我在讲话中，多次提到“蒋委员长”，国民党的将领果然“闻蒋必站”，结果是起立、坐下，坐下、起立，弄得连筷子也顾不上拿。伯承同志一边讲，一边描绘，同志们听了无不捧腹大笑。而他自己却不动声色，继续说道：这确实近乎笑话，但它反映了国民党的下上级关系。那些军官们，表面上对他们的“委员长”唯命唯谨，实际上还不是“竹竿随身，逢场作戏”。如果他们上下之间真是所谓“精诚团结”，何以会老打败仗？他们称蒋介石为“总裁”，其实什么总裁！无非是高高在上，却要裁决一切，这样还能不处处失算？
    还有一次，伯承同志在谈到加强纪律的问题时，讲了这样一个笑话。他说：记不得是哪本书上写了这么三个秀才，走到一堵白墙跟前，墙上有块牌子，上书“此墙不准画”。于是他们就议论开了。一个秀才说，“不准画？吾人偏要画一画！”第二个说，“你画我也画！”第三个说，“要画大家画！”结果各显神通，白墙自然也就不白了。显然，伯承同志是用此来为那些无视革命纪律、明知故犯的人画像的。时至今日，在我们的现实生活中，这个故事仍未失去它的讽谕意义。那些以权谋私的人，那些所谓“倒爷”们，他们的行为轨迹同这三个秀才不是很有些相似吗？他们目无党纪国法，见利忘义，互相竞逐，互相攀比，“你‘谋’（私）我也‘谋’”，“你‘倒’我也‘倒’”，许多的歪风就是这么刮起来的。
    伯承同志读的书很多，不独对马克思主义的书，就是对一些历史著作也经常阅读。大概是建国初期，一次他问我看过曾国藩的《家书》没有，我说早年读过。接着他讲了他的看法：这位“曾文正公”，其人不可取，但也不要因人废言。他的《家书》，也并非都是腐儒之见，其中有些见解，我看还是可以借鉴的。比方说，他给他的弟弟曾国荃写过不少的信，其时曾国荃镇守南京，已是万军之将。曾国藩在信中一条是劝他戒躁，处事一定要沉着、冷静、多思；另一条是劝他要注意及早选拔“替手”，说“办大事者，以多选替手为第一义”。我插了一句：曾国藩讲的这两条，作为治军为政之术，不无道理。伯承同志说：关于选拔“替手”，或者叫物色“助手”，任何领导者都有这个任务。但是要做起来，要把“替手”选准选好，难度不小，因为人苦不自知，知人亦不易。所以要特别注意两点：一是要多方考察，慎重选拔，既不能纳用庸才滥竽充数，更不能让巧佞之徒乘隙而入，而必须使入选者德才兼备。“德者才之帅，才者德之征”，二者缺一不可；二是对于“替手”，领导者当然要信任他们，要放手让他们工作，要倾听他们的意见和建议，但是对其意见和建议要择善而从，不善则弃，不能一概听信。否则，就可能越俎代庖，名为“替手”而实际上却当了“舵手”了。这样的现象历史上不乏其例。伯承同志的这些看法，我以为是言真意切、耐人寻味的。（六）
    还有两件事，我一直牢记在心。一件是伯承同志看望我的母亲，另一件是伯承同志怒斥他的一个儿子。两事看似寻常，却能见微知著，而且于爱于憎，泾渭分明。
    1939年底，阎锡山发动了“十二月事变”，局势骤然紧张。当时，我和母亲正住在沁源县的阎寨村。一天，伯承同志和小平同志亲自来到阎寨，除了要同我商谈如何反击阎锡山的进攻和决死一纵队与三八六旅合并的事，主要是来看望我的母亲。很不凑巧，那天恰好我不在家。事后母亲告诉我，说来了两位客人，像是大人物，一进门就问“伯母好”，并向她深深鞠了一躬。母亲还说：其中一位年长者，看上去比我小不了几岁，也叫我“伯母”。他们问这问那，又说又笑，要我少为你操些心，好好保重身体，可亲切了。听两位的口音，好像都是四川那边的。我腿脚不灵，不能起身答礼，也没招待一下人家，实在过意不去。我对母亲说：他们都是我的上级领导，长者姓刘，少者姓邓，都是一二九师的，一位是师长，一位是政委，就是以前我向您谈起过的“刘、邓首长”。她听了激动地说：原来是他们二位啊！你见到他们可要代我赔个不是，说我人老不中用了，太失敬了。我把母亲的心意转告了伯承同志，说老人家很感激你们二位去看她，一直念念不忘这件事。伯承同志辗然一笑：我看是伯母的礼心太重了，她年高德劭，我们去看望一下，完全应该嘛！孟夫子不是说“老吾老，以及人之老”吗？敬老尊贤，这是中华民族的传统美德，几千年来历久不衰，我们这些共产党员当然要带头遵守和发扬。如果我在这方面做得不好，还请你多加提醒和批评。记得当时常来看望我母亲的，还有滕代远、毕占云等许多同志。尽管当时是在战争环境中，条件很艰苦，但上下之间、老少之间、同志之间，互相体贴，互相尊重，蔚然成风，处处充满着友爱之情。由此我想到一个问题，可以说从我们党成立以来，就一直有这么一些论调，好像共产党人是只讲革命，只知道搞阶级斗争，而不讲人性，不懂人情，不要人道主义的，其实这是完全不符合事实的，不管这些论调是来自什么营垒或哪个方面，都是非愚即妄的无稽之谈。
    关于伯承同志怒斥他的一个儿子的事，记得也是在“十二月事变”前后听他讲的。事情发生在“八一”南昌起义以后。伯承同志经由香港到了上海，后来又去了苏联。他抵达上海不久，他在老家时出生的一个儿子找到了他的住处，同时还带去一个花枝招展的女人。伯承同志早已知道他的行为不端，马上引起了警觉，当即问其来意。对方回答说：我准备结婚，需要一笔钱，希望能尽力相助。伯承同志说，我一不做官，非达官贵人，二不经商，非富商大贾，而是连年奔波，戎马疆场，手头并无积蓄，这是其一；其二，即使我有钱，也不能给你，你早已成年，应该正道直行，自食其力，而不应放浪形骸，靠别人的荫庇，那样就会害了你自己。他那个儿子一听厉声说道：那好，我们就走着瞧吧！说完拂袖而去。伯承同志就对他的夫人说：这家伙肯定要去告密，我们必须马上转移。果然不出所料，不久敌人就来了，但是扑了个空。这件事不仅说明了伯承同志的机警过人，也充分表现了他大义灭亲的革命正气。
    伯承同志虽已长逝，但他的革命精神将同民族的文明和人
  民的智慧共存，他的光辉业绩将与历史的发展和祖国的进步同
  在。
    我们以及我们的后人，将会从他的精神和业绩中不断汲取
  力量，为振兴中华、实现四化而奋勇前进。
