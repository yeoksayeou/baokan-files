Advertising Overheating Should Cool Down, Chaos Must Be Rectified

	People's Daily, Beijing, April 7th—Reported by Pan Gang: The overheating of the advertising industry, as well as issues such as false advertising, using kickbacks to attract advertising, and "administrative command advertising," must be corrected. Today, Deputy Director of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, Tian Shukun, revealed that a nationwide advertising rectification campaign is currently underway. The aim is to rectify the current overheating phenomenon by investigating false advertisements, stopping the use of improper means to attract advertising business, and strengthening the approval and management of temporary advertising operations.

	Relevant data shows that the advertising industry in China developed rapidly last year. By the end of the year, there were 10,800 advertising agencies nationwide, with 117,300 employees, and an advertising revenue of 1.589 billion yuan, representing increases of 31%, 27%, and 42.9% respectively compared to the previous year. Why have the number of advertising agencies and advertising revenue grown so rapidly? Tian Shukun believes that, in addition to the main reason of the development of the commodity economy driving the growth of the advertising industry, there are also some negative factors. For example, some enterprises have incorrect business ideas, do not focus on improving product quality, but use false advertising for deceptive propaganda; some units treat applying for advertising business as a means to seek benefits for their department or as an important source of income for their unit; some units, for various reasons, use improper means to attract advertising and solicit business; and some, for the sake of making money, operate temporary advertising under various pretexts and impose fees on enterprises. The quality of some advertising designs also needs improvement.

	Tian Shukun said that the State Administration for Industry and Commerce will conduct a thorough rectification of the advertising operating order and issues in advertising propaganda. The main contents of the rectification are: first, to clean up and rectify all advertising companies; second, to crack down on illegal operations; third, to investigate various illegal advertisements, with a focus on false advertisements. For those who use the pretext of operating temporary advertising activities to forcibly impose fees and profit from it, they must be firmly stopped.

　　广告过热应当降温  混乱现象必须整顿
    本报北京４月７日讯  记者潘岗报道：广告业发展“过热”以及虚假广告、用支付“回扣”拉广告、“行政命令广告”等广告行业发展中出现的一些混乱现象，应当得到纠正。国家工商局副局长田树千今天在此间透露，目前正在全国范围进行广告整顿工作，以通过查处虚假广告，制止用不正当手段招揽广告业务，加强对临时性广告经营活动的审批与管理，使目前广告业“过热”现象“降温”。
    有关资料表明，去年我国广告事业发展较快，到年底全国广告经营单位已有１．０８万家，从业人员达１１．７３万人，广告营业额达１５．８９亿元，分别比上年增长３１％、２７％和４２．９％。广告经营单位和广告营业额为何增长这么快？田树千认为，除了商品经济发展带动了广告业增长这一主要原因外，还有一些不良因素。如，有的企业经营思想不端正，不重视提高产品质量，却利用虚假广告进行欺骗宣传；一些单位把申请经营广告业务当成为本部门谋福利，或作为本单位的一项重要财源；有的单位出于种种原因，采取不正当手段拉广告，揽业务；还有的为了赚钱，打着各种招牌经营临时性广告，向企业摊派。有的广告设计质量也有待于提高。
    田树千说，国家工商局将对广告经营秩序和广告宣传中存在的问题进行一次认真整顿。整顿的内容主要有：一是对所有广告公司进行清理整顿；二是取缔非法经营活动；三是查处各类违法广告，重点是虚假广告。对以搞临时性广告经营活动为借口，强行摊派费用从中渔利的，要坚决制止。
