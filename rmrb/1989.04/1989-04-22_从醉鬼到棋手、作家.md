	From Drunkard to Chess Player and Writer
	“A filthy, muddy park was his home, a damp, dark doorway his bedroom. For over 5,000 days and nights, a bottle of alcohol was his only companion.” This is a sketch of John Hill’s 15 years of vagrant life.

	Over 30 years ago, he wandered the streets of London, addicted to alcohol. With no money, he would beg or steal. When the craving for alcohol hit, he would drink any beverage containing alcohol. He would even pick up empty bottles from the garbage, pour out the remaining alcohol, mix it with a little water, or sometimes even soak alcohol-soaked cotton from public restrooms in water to satisfy his craving. He recalled, “In those days, he could suddenly lose consciousness and die on the street at any moment.”

	46 years ago, Hill was born into an Irish immigrant family in London. His father was a worker. His childhood was plagued by poverty and racial discrimination. Neighbors' children bullied this immigrant’s son, often beating him up. Their parents not only did not stop them but also mocked and laughed at him. His father was unable to protect his son and often vented his anger on him, making a whip a common sight in Hill’s life. In such a harsh environment, he started drinking secretly at the age of 14 and realized that “alcohol could help him escape all troubles and pains.” He gradually became an alcoholic, unable to live without it. Later, he served in the military and found work, but was discharged or fired due to his drinking. His family saw him as a disgrace and cut off all ties with him. Thus, he was forced to wander from place to place.

	20 years ago, he was sentenced to a year in prison for drunkenness. After his release, a court official named Clifford Soley (who later became a member of parliament) kept in touch with him and guided him. From then on, his life began a new chapter.

	A friend taught him how to play international chess. Without a chessboard, he would draw one on a bench with a pencil, and without chess pieces, he would use paper instead. Hill soon became obsessed with chess, thinking about it even while eating and cooking. He transformed from a “drunkard” into a “chess enthusiast.”

	He showed exceptional talent and aptitude in chess, and soon won the British International Chess Championship. However, chess was not Hill’s final destination. He found the profession of playing chess tedious, sometimes playing for 12 hours straight, which left him exhausted. He said, “If I continue playing chess like this, I will be killed, what’s the difference from my past drinking?”

	So, he decided to forge a new path. He began to learn writing. After long, arduous efforts, he succeeded again. His first book, an autobiographical novel titled “The Kingdom of Small Adventures,” was recently published. In March, the book won the highest literary award in Britain—the Akers Prize. His literary talent attracted high attention from the British literary circle.

	Hill became a chess master in Britain and a renowned writer, long free from past poverty, and his economic situation improved. Originally, he could have dressed better and lived more luxuriously. However, a sweater and a pair of jeans are his usual attire. For over a decade, he still lives with his elderly mother in a regular apartment provided by the government for the poor. He said, talent has indeed changed his life, but he still belongs to a working-class family in London. He wrote “The Kingdom of Small Adventures” to vividly depict human spirit.

### 从醉鬼到棋手、作家

　　从醉鬼到棋手、作家
    “肮脏泥泞的公园是家，潮湿、阴暗的门洞是他的卧室，在５０００多个日日夜夜里，酒瓶成了他唯一的‘伴侣’。”这就是约翰·希利１５年流浪生活的素描。
    ３０多年前，他流浪伦敦街头，酗酒成癖。没有钱，就去乞讨、偷窃。酒瘾一来，见了任何带酒精的饮料他都喝。如到垃圾堆里捡空酒瓶，倒出瓶底的剩酒，再兑上一点水，有时甚至从公共厕所的垃圾筒里捡来酒精棉花浸泡在水里作饮料，以此来过过瘾。他回忆说：“在那些日子里，随时都有可能突然失去知觉，倒毙街头。”
    ４６年前，希利出生在伦敦一个爱尔兰移民家庭，父亲是工人。他的童年遭到贫困和种族歧视的双重折磨。周围邻居的孩子对这个外来移民后代百般欺凌，不时对他拳脚相加，他们的大人不但不加阻止，反而在一旁讽刺讥笑。他的父亲无能保护自己的儿子，还经常在儿子身上出气，皮鞭成了希利的“家常便饭。”在这样恶劣的环境里，他１４岁就开始偷偷弄点酒喝，并悟出了这样一个“真理”：酒精可以帮他摆脱一切烦恼和痛苦。他慢慢地酗酒成癖，生活再也离不开酒了。后来，他参过军，也找到过工作，均因酗酒而被除名或解雇。家庭也视他为全家的耻辱，跟他断绝了一切关系。这样，他只得四处流浪。
    ２０年前，一次他因发酒疯犯了法，被判徒刑一年。出狱后，法院一位名叫克利富·索莱里的官员（后来当了国会议员）跟他保持联系，对他进行开导。从此，他的生活开始了新的一页。
    一位好友教他下国际象棋。没有棋盘，就用铅笔在板凳上画一张，没有棋子就用纸片取代。希利不久就对下棋着了迷，连吃饭、做菜都在想下棋，他由“醉鬼”变成了“棋迷”。
    他在棋艺上显示出了超群的才华和天赋，没多久，便荣获全英国际象棋锦标赛的冠军。可是，下棋并非希利的最终归宿。他对以弈棋作为职业，感到厌烦，有时一连下棋１２个小时，使他疲惫不堪。他说：“再这样下棋，我就会被活活整死，这跟过去的酗酒有什么两样呢？”
    于是，他下定决心想再闯出一条新路。他开始学习写作。经过长期艰苦的努力，他又一次成功了。他撰写的第一部书，即自传体小说《小草的天地》前不久终于问世。今年３月，该书获得了英国文学最高奖赏——阿克雷奖。他的文学才华引起了英国文坛的高度重视。
    希利先后成了英国棋坛的高手、文坛的名作家，早已摆脱了过去的贫困，经济也宽裕多了。本来，他可以穿得好一些，住得豪华一些。然而，一件毛衣、一条牛仔裤就是他的装束。１０多年来，他仍跟老母亲住在政府为贫民提供的普通公寓里。他说，才华固然改变了他的生活，但他仍属伦敦工人阶级的家庭。他撰写《小草的天地》是想生动地再现人类的精神。　　　　　　　　　世绍编译
