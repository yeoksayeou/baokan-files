Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 1st.

The draft Administrative Litigation Law and the draft Rules of Procedure for the National People's Congress are basically mature. Wang Hanbin suggested that the Presidium review and submit them to the plenary session for deliberation and adoption.

Wang Hanbin, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the Legislative Affairs Commission, reported to the Third Plenary Meeting of the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress today on the results of the deliberation of the draft Administrative Litigation Law and the draft Rules of Procedure for the National People's Congress. He said that these two draft laws are basically mature and suggested that the Presidium review and submit them to the plenary session for deliberation and adoption.

Wang Hanbin reported on the modifications suggested by the Legislative Affairs Commission based on the deliberations of various delegations regarding the two draft laws.

Regarding the draft Administrative Litigation Law, Wang Hanbin said that the Legislative Affairs Commission proposed eight modifications. Among them, it is suggested to add a provision: "When the people's courts hear administrative cases in autonomous regions, they should also base their decisions on the autonomous regulations and single regulations of the autonomous region."

Wang Hanbin said that some representatives suggested that the implementation of the Administrative Litigation Law might bring difficulties to certain rural work, such as family planning and grain procurement. Regarding family planning, implementing the family planning policy requires legal administrative measures. Currently, sixteen provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government have formulated relevant local regulations on family planning. It is suggested that other provinces also hasten to formulate relevant local regulations, and the State Council is also preparing to hasten the formulation of the family planning regulations. In this way, family planning work can be legally based. Regarding the procurement of grain and other agricultural products, farmers should fulfill their delivery tasks according to the contract, and relevant government departments should supply agricultural production materials according to the contract. The main issue is to improve work. It is suggested that this law come into effect on October 1, 1990, with a year and a half from passage to implementation, to allow various places time to prepare various work. We should turn the formulation and implementation of the Administrative Litigation Law into a driving force to improve work in these areas.

Regarding the draft Rules of Procedure for the National People's Congress, the Legislative Affairs Commission proposed six modifications. Wang Hanbin said that many representatives suggested that if major changes are to be made to the national plan and budget during their implementation, the State Council should report to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for approval. Therefore, it is suggested to add a provision according to the relevant provisions of the Constitution: "After the national economic and social development plan and the state budget are approved by the National People's Congress, if they need to be partially adjusted during their implementation, the State Council should submit the adjustment plan to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for review and approval."

Wang Hanbin said that some representatives suggested that during this session, when various delegations hold full meetings to deliberate on the government work report and reports on the national plan and budget, the heads of relevant departments of the State Council go to the delegations to listen to opinions and answer questions, which is a good practice and should be stipulated in the rules of procedure. Therefore, it is suggested to add a provision in Article 40 of the draft: "When various delegations hold full meetings to deliberate on the government work report and reports on the national economic and social development plan and its implementation, and reports on the state budget and its implementation, the heads of the State Council and relevant departments of the State Council should attend the meetings to listen to opinions and answer questions." It is also suggested to add a provision in the draft regarding "The Chairman of the Presidium can convene representatives selected by the delegations to discuss major specialized issues" that "the heads of relevant departments of the State Council attend the meeting to report the situation and answer questions."

　　行政诉讼法草案　人大议事规则草案基本成熟
    王汉斌建议主席团审议后提请大会审议通过
    新华社北京四月一日电  全国人大常委会副委员长、全国人大法律委员会主任委员王汉斌今天在向七届全国人大二次会议主席团第三次会议作关于行政诉讼法草案、全国人大议事规则草案审议结果的报告时说，这两个法律草案基本上是成熟的，建议主席团审议后提请大会审议通过。
    王汉斌汇报了法律委员会根据各代表团的审议意见，对两个法律草案进行审议后提出的修改建议。
    关于行政诉讼法草案王汉斌说，法律委员会提出八点修改建议，其中建议增加规定：“人民法院审理民族自治地方的行政案件也以该民族自治地方的自治条例和单行条例为依据。”
    王汉斌说，有些代表提出，行政诉讼法的实施，可能对农村一些工作如计划生育、粮食定购等带来困难。关于计划生育，实行计划生育政策，需要有合法的行政手段，现在已有十六个省、自治区、直辖市制定了有关计划生育的地方性法规，建议其他省也抓紧制定有关的地方性法规，同时国务院还准备抓紧制定计划生育条例。这样，就可以使计划生育工作有法可依。关于粮食等农产品定购问题，农民应当按照合同规定完成交售任务，政府有关部门应当按照合同规定供应农业生产资料，主要是改进工作的问题。建议本法自一九九零年十月一日起施行，从通过到实施有一年半的时间，就是为了便于各地有时间做好各项准备工作。我们要把行政诉讼法的制定和实施，变成改进这些方面工作的动力。
    关于全国人大议事规则草案，法律委员会提出六点修改建议。王汉斌说，许多代表提出，国家计划和预算在执行过程中如果要作重大变动，国务院应报全国人大常委会批准。因此，建议根据宪法有关规定，增加一条：“国民经济和社会发展计划、国家预算经全国人民代表大会批准后，在执行过程中必须作部分调整的，国务院应当将调整方案提请全国人民代表大会常务委员会审查和批准。”
    王汉斌说，有些代表提出，在这次会议上，各代表团全体会议审议政府工作报告和关于国家计划、预算的报告时，国务院各部门负责人分别到代表团听取意见，回答询问，这种做法很好，议事规则应予规定。因此，建议在草案第四十条中增加一款：“各代表团全体会议审议政府工作报告和关于国民经济和社会发展计划及计划执行情况的报告、关于国家预算及预算执行情况的报告的时候，国务院和国务院各部门负责人应当分别参加会议，听取意见，回答询问。”并在草案关于“主席团常务主席可以就重大的专门性问题，召集代表团推选的有关代表进行讨论”的规定中增加规定，“国务院有关主管部门负责人参加会议，汇报情况，回答问题”。
