Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, April 19th.

The 102-year-old veteran of the Wuchang Uprising in the Xinhai Revolution and member of the Wuhan Municipal Institute of History and Culture, Fu Xiyue, passed away in Wuhan on April 15. Fu Xiyue's memorial service was held today in Wuhan.

Fu Xiyue was a native of Anlu County, Hubei Province. In his early years, he was influenced by the revolutionary ideas of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. 78 years ago, Fu Xiyue, as a student in the Surveying Class of the Imperial Military Academy, participated in the Wuchang Uprising during the Xinhai Revolution. He was wounded in the Yangxia Battle under the command of Huang Xing.

This veteran of the Xinhai Revolution had always cherished the hope of national reunification and family reunion. In 1949, his wife, two sons, and eldest daughter went to Taiwan. Last July, his youngest son, Fu Jiguo, chairman of the Taiwan-based Jili Enterprise Co., Ltd., and his daughter-in-law came to Wuhan to visit their father, whom they had not seen for 40 years. Mr. Fu expressed his wish to his son to spend his remaining years in Taiwan so that he could be buried with his late wife, who had passed away in Taiwan.
