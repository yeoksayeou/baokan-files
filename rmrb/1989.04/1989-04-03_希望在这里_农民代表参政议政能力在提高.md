The farmer representatives attending the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress have shown a level of political consultation capability that is heartening.

The Guangxi delegation alone proposed 111 suggestions, of which 20 came from farmer representatives.

Na Sun Shuxiang, a farmer representative from Jilin, after listing examples such as his village being burdened with over 300 yuan per household last year, loudly declared: The People's Congress enacts laws, but when will they enact a law to address the excessive burdens on farmers?

The farmer representatives in the People's Congress have shown a strong sense of construction in their consultations, which has made many people take notice. Wei Shijun, a 30-year-old farmer representative from Guangxi, said: Mutual blame will not push agriculture to new heights; only by working together can we truly revitalize agriculture. Can the central government establish an authoritative agricultural leadership group that includes production, supply, and sales, to fully focus on rural work? Can farmers establish a labor accumulation system, specifying the number of workdays each labor force should contribute to agricultural and water conservancy projects each year?

To prevent township enterprises from repeating the old path of "booming one moment and shutting down the next," female representative and deputy mayor of Luoyang Town, Guangxi's Enjiang County, Tan Meixing, suggested: Can local governments, according to industrial policies, quickly compile a list of township enterprises that should be protected? In this information age, we don't need to wait for conflicts to escalate and losses to mount before adjusting our actions.

How to improve the political consultation capabilities of farmer representatives? This is a concern for many provincial, municipal, and autonomous region leaders. Meng Fulin, a representative of the People's Congress and vice-secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, said: "Anhui is an agricultural province, and the enhancement of political consultation capabilities by farmer representatives is our hope." In the past two years, Anhui has organized farmer representatives to investigate one or two key issues each year, avoiding the "superficial" and "massive" style of inspections, with good results. They also plan to regularly send investigation outlines to farmer representatives, guiding them to conduct targeted activities.

During the interviews, the reporter deeply felt that for various levels of leadership, increasing the transparency of work and expanding the scope of information available to farmer representatives is an urgent issue. However, grasping the key issues that affect the overall situation from a high level, rather than focusing on trivial matters, depends on the scientific and cultural level of farmer representatives.

    ——农民代表参政议政能力在提高
    本报记者  鹿舫
    出席七届人大二次会议的农民代表显示出的参政议政能力，令人欣喜。
    本次会议广西代表团共提出１１１项建议，其中２０项出自农民代表。
    来自吉林的农民代表孙树祥在列举他所在的村去年每个农户被各种摊派摊去３００多元等事例后，高声道：人大立这法立那法，啥时也立个法，治治农民负担过重。
    人大代表中的农民兄弟在议政中表现出的建设意识，使许多人刮目相看。年方三十的广西农民代表韦仕军说：互相埋怨不能使农业再上新台阶，上下同心才能让农业真正升温。上头——中央能不能组建一个有权威的包括产、供、销一条龙的农业领导小组，全力抓农村工作？下头——农家能不能建立劳动积累制度，规定每个劳动力每年用于农田水利建设的投工数量？
    为了使乡镇企业不再重走“上时‘一窝蜂’，下时‘一刀切’”的老路，女代表、广西环江毛南族自治县洛阳镇副镇长谭梅星说：各地政府可否按照产业政策，迅速列出一批应保的乡镇企业名录？在当今信息时代，大可不必等矛盾激化、损失惨重时才来调整我们的所作所为。
    如何提高农民代表的参政议政能力？这是许多省、市、自治区负责人的一桩心思。人大代表、中共安徽省委副书记孟富林说：“安徽是农业省，农民代表参政议政能力的增强，是我们的希望所在。”近两年，安徽每年组织农民代表对一两个重点问题进行调查，尽量不搞那种“走马观花”、大呼隆式的视察，效果不错。他们还准备定期向农民代表发调查提纲，使他们有目的地进行活动。
    记者在采访中深感，对各级领导机关来说，增加工作的透明度，扩大农民代表的知情范围，是一个亟待解决的问题。而高屋建瓴地把握关系全局的荦荦大端，不是老抓那些不带本质意义的“小鼻子小眼”，则有待于农民代表的科学、文化水平的提高。
