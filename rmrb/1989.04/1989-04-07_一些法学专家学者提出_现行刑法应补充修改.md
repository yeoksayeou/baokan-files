Some legal experts and scholars have proposed that the current criminal law should be supplemented and amended. According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 5 (Reporter Zhang Mengyi), Chinese experts and scholars are calling for the amendment and supplementation of the current criminal law, including provisions related to "counter-revolutionary crimes" and the death penalty.

Some experts suggest that the amendment of the criminal law should adhere to the policy of "minimizing the use of the death penalty and reducing the number of death penalty provisions."

The director of the Criminal Law Division at the Institute of Law, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Cui Qingceng, believes that given the current stable economic situation and improving social order, it is appropriate to consider reducing the scope of the death penalty.

However, some scholars with opposing views argue that the death penalty should not only not be reduced but should also be increased for severe fraud and counterfeiting crimes. They believe that only by severely punishing the economic crimes that have emerged in today's society can social stability and the smooth progress of reforms be maintained.

Many experts suggest changing the term "counter-revolutionary crimes" in the criminal law to "crimes endangering national security" and making corresponding adjustments and amendments to other chapters. They believe that "counter-revolutionary" is a political concept rather than a strict legal concept, making it difficult to distinguish between crimes and non-crimes.

Experts also suggest making significant amendments and supplements to other types of crimes, particularly to crimes that endanger socialist economic order. They propose adding approximately 50 new offenses, including: illegal occupation, sale, and transfer of land, destruction of mineral resources, patent infringement, illegal manufacture and sale of substandard products, foreign exchange evasion, embezzlement, disruption of private, individual, and joint-venture enterprise production, printing and selling illegal publications, prostitution, solicitation, drug abuse, and severe environmental pollution.

Some experts propose that regulations should be made for corporate crimes involving the abuse of power for personal gain and interference with judicial proceedings, which seriously infringe upon the interests of the state and the people. The current criminal law of China was enacted in 1979.

### 一些法学专家学者提出  现行刑法应补充修改

　　一些法学专家学者提出
    现行刑法应补充修改
    据新华社北京４月５日电（记者张孟仪）中国专家和学者呼吁对现行刑法进行修改和补充，其中涉及“反革命罪”和死刑的有关规定。
    一些专家提出，修改刑法应贯彻“少杀政策，尽量减少死刑的规定”。
    社会科学院法学所刑法室主任崔庆森认为，当前社会经济形势出现持续稳定、社会治安趋向好转时期，应考虑缩小死刑范围。
    但是，一些持相反意见的学者认为，死刑不仅不能减少，而且应增加对严重诈骗罪、伪造货币罪规定的死刑。他们认为，只有严惩在当前社会上出现的经济犯罪行为，才能保持社会稳定和改革的顺利进行。
    许多专家建议把刑法中的“反革命罪”改为“危害国家安全罪”，并对该章其他章节作相应调整和修改。他们认为，“反革命”是个政治概念，不是严格的法律概念，难以区分罪与非罪。
    专家们还建议对其他各类犯罪，尤其是对破坏社会主义经济罪，进行较大的修改补充。他们提出各章需增加的新罪名约有５０多种，其中主要有：非法侵占、买卖、转让土地，破坏矿产资源，假冒专利，非法制造、销售劣质产品，逃套外汇，挪用公款，破坏私营经济、个体经济、三资企业生产，印刷销售非法出版物，卖淫、嫖宿、吸毒，严重污染环境等。
    一些专家提出对于滥用职权谋利、干预司法，严重侵犯国家和人民利益的犯罪行为应对法人犯罪作出规定。中国现行的刑法是１９７９年通过的。
