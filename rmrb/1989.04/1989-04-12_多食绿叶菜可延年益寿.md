    Eating More Green Leafy Vegetables Can Prolong Life
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 10th - Recent field survey results from the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology indicate that consuming more green leafy vegetables and meat, and maintaining an independent lifestyle can help prolong life.

    According to Kyodo News, the institute compared the long-lived village of Ogi in Okinawa Prefecture with the short-lived village of Nangai in Akita Prefecture. The results showed that the long-lived village had significantly higher intake of meat, green leafy vegetables, dairy products, and legumes compared to the short-lived village. Specifically, the intake of green leafy vegetables was three times higher, and meat intake was 2.7 times higher. In contrast, the short-lived village consumed 1.4 times more rice. Nutritional analysis revealed that the short-lived village had excessive intake of carbohydrates and salt, while lacking in calcium, vitamins, and animal proteins, which are believed to be important factors contributing to shorter lifespans.

    Among elderly people aged 65 and above, 63% of those in the long-lived village live alone or as couples, while 85% of those in the short-lived village live with their children. Elderly people in the long-lived village lead more active, independent lives. In contrast, elderly people in the short-lived village rely on their children, which may accelerate the decline of their physical functions.

　　多食绿叶菜可延年益寿
    新华社东京4月10日电　东京都人口综合研究所最近进行的实地调查比较结果表明，多食绿叶菜和肉类，生活自理有利于延年益寿。
    据共同社报道，该研究所对日本著名长寿村——冲绳的大宜味村和短寿的秋田县的南外村这两个地区进行了比较调查。结果发现长寿村的饮食中，肉类、绿叶菜、乳制品、豆类的摄取量大大高于短寿村。特别是绿叶菜为短寿村的3倍，肉类为2.7倍。相反短寿村的米饭食用量是长寿村的1.4倍。从营养分析结果看，短寿村的碳水化合物、食盐食用过多，而钙、维生素、动物性蛋白质食用不足。据认为这是短寿的重要原因。
    从65岁以上老人的家庭构成看，长寿村老人独身或夫妇单独生活的占63％。而短寿村85％的老人是与子女一起生活。长寿村老人的自立生活中活动较多。而短寿村的老人生活依靠子女，这可能加速了身体机能的老化。
