East Germany and Poland held negotiations from April 17 to 21 on the division of the maritime boundary at the mouth of the Oder River. The two countries' representatives signed a draft treaty on the maritime boundary on April 22.

The division of the Oder River estuary boundary has long been a contentious issue between the two countries. The signing of the draft treaty marks the end of their protracted negotiations and will also help resolve related issues such as the division of the continental shelf and fishing zones.
