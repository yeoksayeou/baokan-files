When I first arrived in Singapore to work, I wanted to express my gratitude to the enthusiastic news officials who had helped me by inviting them to a simple meal. As soon as the words left my mouth, they quickly waved their hands and said, “Thank you! We appreciate your kindness. However, the government has strict regulations regarding meals and gifts. Not only do we need to seek approval, but we also have to write a detailed report and submit it along with the gifts to the relevant department. There’s no need to trouble yourself!”

This exchange left a deep impression on me regarding the Singaporean officials' adherence to the law and the government's regulatory power.

The Singaporean government implements a civil service appointment system. Civil servants must first study the government's "Manual of Instructions," which consists of six volumes. It provides detailed regulations on the duties, rights, and benefits of civil servants, as well as their appearance and conduct. For example, it prohibits civil servants from directly or indirectly using their authority to benefit themselves or their relatives. It even forbids civil servants from participating in unauthorized activities using their government titles. If they attend official events, they must obtain approval from the permanent secretary of their department.

Singapore is a commercial society with significant speculative activities in stocks, futures, and financial transactions. To prevent officials from using their positions or insider information to benefit themselves or their acquaintances, the government stipulates that civil servants can invest in publicly listed stocks but are not allowed to directly or indirectly own any shares in companies operating in Singapore. The "Manual of Instructions" also states that superiors cannot borrow money from their subordinates or from individuals with whom they have a working relationship. When lending money, officials must not charge interest. Unsecured loans cannot exceed three months' total salary. Gambling is also strictly prohibited. Those who violate these regulations will be immediately dismissed.

Singapore has established an effective supervision and enforcement system. Financial transparency is one of the key measures. Every March, the parliament debates the budget. Television and newspapers provide detailed coverage. The budget is sold in bookstores, detailing the flow of various funds. Every July, civil servants must report to the permanent secretary of their department, disclosing any financial issues and their stock investments and profits. The permanent secretary is responsible for reviewing these reports and filing them in personal records.

To prevent corruption, the Singaporean government has implemented a strict set of measures, leaving no room for corrupt officials. Superiors and subordinates monitor each other; civil servants cannot stay in the same position for too long. Anti-corruption measures and regulations are reviewed every three to five years, and sometimes surprise inspections are conducted. The Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau, directly under the Prime Minister's Office, is unyielding in its anti-corruption efforts. A few years ago, the Minister for Development, Teh Cheang Wan, was investigated for abuse of power and corruption, and later committed suicide out of fear.

"Moral Cultivation" is another measure the government uses to ensure that civil servants uphold the law. "Moral Cultivation" refers to cultivating the virtues of impartiality and law-abiding behavior among civil servants. To this end, Singapore has long promoted Confucianism and upheld Chinese cultural traditions. With the development of the economy and external influences, extreme individualism has grown among the younger generation in Singapore. They disregard the interests of the nation and the future of the ethnic group, demanding absolute democracy and freedom, and viewing necessary regulations as "restrictions." In response to this trend, the government advocates for the continuation and promotion of excellent national cultural traditions and values, urging people to uphold ethics, know shame, and requiring government officials to love their country and people, be loyal to their duties, uphold the law, and work diligently.

The measures taken by the Singaporean government have initially created a social atmosphere where adherence to laws and regulations is honored, and corruption is shamed, providing favorable conditions for economic development.

　　“法制”“心治”建设廉政
　　李永明
    刚到新加坡工作时，为了向热心帮忙的新闻官员表示感谢，便提出请他们吃顿便饭。话刚出口，对方连忙摆手说：“多谢了！你的情，我们领了。吃饭收礼，政府有严格规定。不仅要请示，还要写成清单式的报告，连同礼品一并送到有关部门。不必麻烦了！”一席话使人对新加坡官员的守法精神和政府法规的威慑力留下深刻印象。
    新加坡政府实行公务员聘任制。公务员必须首先学习政府的“训令手册”，手册有６大本，对公务员的职、权、利，甚至外表举止都有详细的规定，如不准直接或间接地利用职权为自己或亲友谋取利益，甚至不允许公务员以政府职务的身份参加未经允许的活动，若以官方身份出席，必须征得所属部门常任秘书的批准。
    新加坡是个商业社会，股票、期货、金融交易等商业活动投机性较大，为防止官员利用主管工作之便或掌握股票行情和其它商业信息的有利条件，为个人或熟人谋利，政府规定，公务员可以在股市公开挂牌的股票上投资，但不准以直接或间接的手法谋取或拥有任何一家在新加坡营业的公司的股份。“训令”还规定：上级官员不得向他管辖下的职员借钱，也不准向与他有工作关系的人借钱；官员在借出钱时，则不准附加利息。其无担保债务不得超过个人３个月工资的总额。也不得参与或组织赌博。触犯条例者立即辞退。
    新加坡建有一套有效的监督和实施系统。财务公开就是其中一项重要措施。每年３月，国会都要辩论财政预算案。电视台、报纸详尽报道。预算案在书店里出售，里面记着各类款项的流动情况。公务员每年７月必须向所属部门的常任秘书报告，说明自己是否有财务纠葛以及在股票投资和利润方面的情况，常任秘书负责审查这些报告存入个人档案。
    为防止贪污，新加坡政府制定了一套严密的制度，不使贪污分子有机可乘；上下级之间互相监督；公务员不得在同一岗位上任职太久，反贪污措施和条例在三、五年内检查一次，有时还进行突击检查。直属总理署的贪污调查局在反贪污活动中铁面无私。前几年，发展部长郑章远因滥用职权和贪污受贿受到调查，后畏罪自杀。
    “心治”是政府确保公务员秉公守法的另一措施。所谓“心治”是指培养公务员秉公办事、奉公守法的品德。为此，新加坡多年来不遗余力地推崇儒学和发扬中华文化传统。随着经济的发展和外界的影响，在新加坡年轻人中极端个人主义倾向滋长。他们不顾国家的利益和民族的前途，要求绝对的民主和自由，把必要的法规视为“禁锢”。针对这种倾向，政府提出要继续和发扬优秀的民族文化传统和价值观，要求人们讲礼义，知廉耻，要政府官员爱国爱民，忠于职守，奉公守法，兢兢业业地工作。
    新加坡政府采取的上述做法，初步造成了一种以遵纪守法为荣、贪赃枉法为耻的社会风气，为经济的发展创造了有利条件。
