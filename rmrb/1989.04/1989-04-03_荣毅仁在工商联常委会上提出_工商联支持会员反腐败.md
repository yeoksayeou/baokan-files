Rong Yiren, chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, proposed at the sixth session of the second meeting of the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce that the federation should actively reflect the opinions and suggestions of its members, represent the legitimate rights and interests of the industrial and commercial sectors, and support and protect members in reporting and fighting against corruption.

The sixth session of the second meeting of the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce was held in Beijing yesterday and today.

The resolution passed at the meeting stated that the multi-party cooperation system led by the Communist Party is one of the fundamental political systems of our country. The federation, as an internal and external commercial association, should play to its own strengths and actively participate in political consultation and democratic supervision.

The resolution said that further efforts should be made to provide ideas and solutions on major economic and social decision-making issues, and to make unremitting efforts to uphold, improve, enrich, and develop the multi-party cooperation system.

The meeting firmly supported Premier Li Peng's proposal in the government work report to focus on improving the economic environment and rectifying economic order as the key tasks for the next two years of China's construction and reform, and urgently hoped that the various tasks proposed in the report could be implemented in earnest.

Vice Chairmen Li Ding, Ma Yi, Ye Di Sheng, Ye Bao Shan, Sun Fu Ling, Zhang Xiu Wu, Zhang Jing Li, Jing Shu Ping, Jiang Pei Lu, Guo Xiu Zhen, Huang Chang Xi, Huang Liang Chen, and Xiong Ying Dun attended the meeting.
