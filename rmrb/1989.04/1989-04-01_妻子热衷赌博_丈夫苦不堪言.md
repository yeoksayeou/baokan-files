I originally had a happy family. My wife was a good homemaker, and we have two children who are both in middle school. In recent years, gambling has become prevalent in our area, and my wife has been drawn into it. At first, she only played a few rounds of mahjong at the persuasion of others, but once she started, she couldn't stop. Later, even during the one-hour lunch break, she would insist on "playing four rounds." In the past few months, after work, she wouldn't even come home but would go straight to the gambling table, sometimes staying until the early hours of the next morning. As a result, our home no longer feels like a home. I have tried to persuade her to stop gambling, but she won't listen. My children are also gradually being influenced. My eldest son's grades have dropped, and he is becoming more and more difficult to manage. I am truly distressed.

However, the harm caused by gambling is not limited to my family! Gambling has become a major social problem that cannot be taken lightly. Recently, there have been calls to ban gambling from top to bottom, and relevant departments have taken some measures. However, the actions have been weak, and the results have been minimal. The various tragedies caused by gambling are becoming more and more severe. I appeal to the relevant departments to take effective measures to strictly prohibit gambling and save families like mine that are on the verge of breaking up!

　　妻子热衷赌博　丈夫苦不堪言
    我原有一个美满的家庭，妻子是个“贤内助”，一对儿女正在上中学。近年来，我们这里赌风盛行，我的妻子也卷了进去。刚开始，她只是在一些人的劝说下偶尔打几圈麻将，岂料一发不可收拾。后来，就是中午一个多小时的午休时间，她也要“搓四圈”。近几个月来，她下班后，连家也不回就坐上牌桌，有时一直赌到第二天凌晨。如此一来，我的家便不像个家了。我劝她不要再赌了，可她就是不听。我的孩子也慢慢地受了影响，大儿子学习成绩下降，而且越来越难管教。我真是苦不堪言。
    然而，深受赌博之害的何止我一家？！赌博已成了当前社会的一大公害，决不可等闲视之。前些时候，上上下下曾喊过禁赌，有关部门也采取了一些措施，但是雷声大雨点小，虎头蛇尾，收效甚微。因赌博滋生出来的各种人间悲剧愈演愈惨。呼吁有关部门采取有效措施，严禁赌博，救救像我一样濒临破裂的家庭吧！
