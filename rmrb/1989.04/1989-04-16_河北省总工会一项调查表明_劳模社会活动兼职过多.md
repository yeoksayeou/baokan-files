Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, April 16th.

A survey by the Hebei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions has revealed that labor models have too many social activities and part-time jobs. Zhang Xingran, the director of the First Plastic Factory in Shijiazhuang, who is famous for creating the "full-load work method," has already taken on 11 different positions. However, invitations for him to take on more part-time jobs keep pouring in. He spends a lot of time attending various meetings, giving speeches, and receiving visitors, which affects his research on deepening enterprise management, causing him much distress.

The survey results of 115 recipients of the national "May 1st Labor Medal" show that 54 of them hold various social positions totaling 187, averaging 3.5 positions per person, with the highest holding 11 positions. 78 of them spent 4,245 workdays in various social activities in one year, averaging 54 days per person, with the highest reaching 180 days. 90% of the labor models have an excessive workload, equivalent to 2 to 3 times that of ordinary workers. Ai Youqin, a hardworking miner from Tangjiazhuang Mine of Kailuan, has to make up for the time lost due to various social activities by working overtime. When the Hebei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions conducted the survey, the labor models urgently hoped to reduce social activities and not to be burdened with numerous titles.

　　河北省总工会一项调查表明
　　劳模社会活动兼职过多
    新华社石家庄４月１６日电　（记者周吉仲）因创造“满负荷工作法”而闻名的石家庄市第一塑料厂厂长张兴让，尽管已经身兼１１个职务，而请他兼职的请柬仍然接连不断。他因参加各种各样的会议、作报告和接待参观占用了大量时间，影响研究深化企业管理而深感苦恼。
    河北省总工会最近对１１５名全国“五一”劳动奖章获得者调查的结果表明，有５４人兼任各种各样的社会职务１８７个，人均兼职３．５个，最多的兼职１１个。有７８人因参加各类社会活动一年多时间就耗费了４２４５个工作日，人均５４天，最多的达到１８０天。９０％的劳模因此工作负担过重，其工作量相当于一般职工的２至３倍。埋头苦干的开滦唐家庄矿矿工艾有勤，因各种社会活动挤占了工作时间，不得不靠加班加点补上。河北省总工会进行调查时，劳模们迫切希望减少社会活动，不要把名目繁多的头衔加到他们头上。
