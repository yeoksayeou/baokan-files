The Communist Party of China's Hubei Provincial Committee recently decided that, starting immediately, party and government officials are prohibited from building private houses in urban areas. Those who have already built such houses will be subject to inspection, and any illegal or disciplinary violations in the construction process will be seriously investigated and dealt with.

The decision emphasizes that the establishment of an open and transparent system is the starting point for building an anti-corruption system. In the future, all departments of the government will make public their regulations, procedures, deadlines, and results in areas such as the distribution of agricultural production materials, household registration management, business registration, recruitment of workers and drivers, and enrollment of students.
