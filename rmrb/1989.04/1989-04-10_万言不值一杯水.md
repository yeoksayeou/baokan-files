Title: Words Are Worthless, a Cup of Water Is Priceless

	Scholars have been poor since the time of Confucius. Back then, selling tea eggs was not fashionable, so he thought of driving a carriage. He said: “If wealth can be pursued, even a lowly carriage driver, I would do it too.” (Analects of Confucius, Shuo Er) This means if there is a way to become wealthy, he would even drive a carriage for someone else.

	However, Confucius left behind the Analects. If we accumulate the print runs over the generations, it would probably be the best-selling book. If we were to calculate the royalties, it would be a considerable amount, but he didn't earn a single penny from it.

	Li Bai has a poem that says: “Composing poems and essays by the north window, a thousand words are not worth a cup of water.” This shows that even back then, manuscripts were not valuable. There were exceptions, such as Zuo Si's "Three Capitals Rhapsody," which made paper in Luoyang expensive (actually, it had the value of a reference book). It was almost comparable to a modern bestseller. Zuo Si did not get rich, nor did he change his fate. He remained unrecognized, holding only the position of a secretary, and eventually turned to nature in despair, lamenting: “In what age are there no talented people, left to wither in the wilderness?”

	One might say that Li Bai's poetic fame was not inferior to Wang Xizhi's calligraphy. Wang Xizhi could exchange his calligraphy for a white goose, so Li Bai's poems should be worth at least a few cups of wine. Why did he say they were “not worth a cup of water”? The problem was that spiritual products were not considered commodities at that time. Poetry, without the aid of paper and calligraphy to transcribe and carve, was not easy to sell. After Li Bai, during the Tang Dynasty's Changqing era, poet Yuan Zhen wrote a preface for Bai Juyi's "Changqing Collection," mentioning that in Yangzhou and Yuezhou, people were copying and selling Bai Juyi's poems and exchanging them for tea and wine. But don't assume that literature had become a commodity at that time. Calligraphers transcribed, printers carved, and merchants sold, but Yuan Zhen and Bai Juyi had nothing to do with it, because there were no royalties or “copyright” notices.

	Now things are different. With royalties and copyright laws, literature is a special commodity. In theory, writers should be prosperous, but that's not necessarily the case. Just look at the piles of rejected manuscripts in the editorial offices. It's not just that a thousand words are not worth a cup of water; even a hundred thousand or a million words might not be worth a cup of water. If an article is not published, the writer not only doesn't get royalties but also spends money on paper, envelopes, and postage. This is not like farmers growing melons, where one planted is one harvested. Nor is it like workers making wheels, where one made is one completed. This is because material products are tangible, and their value is easy to calculate. However, spiritual products are hard to evaluate. You say it has value, but it might not; you say it has no value, but it might still have some.

	Precisely because of this, seizing someone else's material products without reason, seizing the labor of workers and farmers without reason, is called exploitation. But seizing someone else's spiritual products without reason, such as signing one's own name on someone else's work, seizing the labor of writers without reason, what do we call this? This is called the civilized form of beating, smashing, and looting.

### 万言不值一杯水

　　万言不值一杯水
    读书人穷，可以追溯到孔子那里。那时还不时兴卖茶叶蛋，于是他想到了赶马车，他说：“富而可求也，虽执鞭之士，吾亦为之。”（《论语·述而》）就是说，如果能富之有道，替人家赶马车他也愿意。
    但孔子留下了一部《论语》，倘若历代累计起来，恐怕是印数第一，如果要拿稿费，一定不老少，但他却一个子儿也没得。
    李白有诗云：“吟诗作赋北窗里，万言不值一杯水。”可见那时候文稿就不值钱。也有例外，左思作《三都赋》而使洛阳纸贵（其实是具有工具书的使用价值），简直可以和现代畅销书媲美了。左思并没有发财，更没能改变自己的命运，他依旧怀才不遇，官只做到秘书郎，终因潦倒不得志，转而投向大自然的怀抱，悲愤地感慨：“何世无奇才，遗之在草莽”。
    按说，李白的诗名可以说不让于王羲之的书法，王羲之可以书成换白鹅，李白的诗也不至于换不回二两酒来，何至于“不值一杯水”呢？问题就是那时候的精神产品还不算商品，诗歌不借助于纸张工具和书法技艺缮写勘刻出来，是不好卖的。李白之后，唐长庆四年，诗人元稹为白居易《长庆集》作序，序中说当时扬州和越州一带，处处有人将白居易和他的诗“缮写模勒”，在街上售卖或换茶酒。但不要以为那时文学已成了商品，书家缮写印家勘刻商贩售卖，与元稹和白居易是没关系的，因为那时既没有稿费，也没有“版权所有，不得翻印”之类。
    现在好了，有了稿费和版权制度，文学也是特殊商品，按说作文章的人应该发起来了，然而却未必。只要看一看编辑部里那汗牛充栋的废稿，别说万言不值一杯水，就是百万言、万万言不值一杯水，也说得过。文章发表不了，写文章的人不仅拿不到稿费，反倒贴进了稿纸、信封和邮票钱。这不像农民种瓜，种一个成一个。也不像工人车轮子，车一个成一个。这是因为物质产品是有形的，它的价值好计算。而精神产品却难说得很，你说它有价值，未必就有价值；你说它没有价值，说不定碰巧还有点价值。
    正由于此，所以无端地占有了别人的物质产品，无端地占有工人农民的劳动，叫剥削；而无端地占有了别人的精神产品，比如在别人的著作上署上自己的大名，无端地占有了文人的劳动，这叫什么？这叫文明的打、砸、抢。
