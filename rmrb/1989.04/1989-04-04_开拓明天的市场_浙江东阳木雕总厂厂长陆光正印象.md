A white suit, a black tie. Short in stature, but brimming with confidence. He is not only a master of wood carving, one of the 62 national masters of arts and crafts, but also a capable leader. In just five years, he has transformed a struggling enterprise into a thriving one, increasing its annual output from 2 million yuan to over 20 million yuan, with products exported to more than 80 countries and regions. For a man from a humble background in a small county, what more could he ask for?

However, Lu Guangzheng feels that Dongyang wood carving should make a greater contribution to meeting market demands. He yearns to seamlessly integrate the ancient art of Dongyang wood carving with modern architectural and interior decoration, creating a phoenix-like rebirth at the intersection of traditional craftsmanship and future markets.

Known as the "Oriental Art Treasure," Dongyang wood carving has a glorious past. Its exquisite techniques, elegant style, and numerous masterpieces, including palace carvings represented by the Forbidden City in Beijing, religious carvings represented by the Buddha statue in Lingyin Temple in Hangzhou, residential carvings represented by the Lu Residence in Dongyang, and furniture and decorative carvings represented by chests and screens exported since 1911, have all left a lasting legacy. There are also renowned predecessors, such as the "Emperor of Carving" Du Yunsong, the "Prime Minister of Carving" Huang Zijing, and the "Scholar of Carving" Lou Shui Ming.

Lu Guangzheng is a disciple of the "Scholar of Carving" Lou Shui Ming. From a young age, he was immersed in an environment filled with spiritual energy. In Dongyang, even the most ordinary families are accustomed to carving doors and windows and engraving tables and chairs. In 1958, at the age of 14, Lu Guangzheng entered the wood carving factory to learn the craft. Seeing his potential, Lou Shui Ming had him write a blood oath, vowing to study diligently and practice hard, and took him as his last disciple.

Lu Guangzheng sees the development and growth of Dongyang wood carving as his lifelong responsibility. Since the 1980s, Dongyang Wood Carving Factory has undertaken more than 90 projects in countries such as the Federal Republic of Germany, the United States, Egypt, and Japan. Among them, the "China Town Restaurant" is praised as the "model of Chinese decoration in West Germany," and Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew commended the "Dong Palace Restaurant" as the "best architectural carving in Singapore to date," even personally cutting the ribbon for it.

For many years, Dongyang wood carving has mainly relied on small carvings like tables, chairs, and chests, almost forgetting the characteristics of residential architectural decoration and the advantages of large-scale carvings. Times have changed. Lu Guangzheng seized the opportunity and established the Dongyang Wood Carving Construction Company. Construction is the means, decoration is the goal. Over the years, the company has left its mark across the country, from the luxurious boats on West Lake to the Mei Lanfang Memorial Pavilion in Taizhou, Jiangsu, from the Green Snail Pagoda in Beidaihe's Xiaodongshan to the Yan Emperor's Mausoleum in Tianxin County, Hunan, from the "Kui Pavilion Ascending to the Heavens" in Xikou, Fenghua, to the Tianjin Broadcasting and Television Grand Studio, completing over 100 architectural decoration projects. Not only has it expanded the traditional path of imitation ancient construction, but it has also left a colorful monument for Dongyang wood carving.

Lu Guangzheng, with the vision of a strategist, closely monitors the emerging interior decoration trend in China. He believes that although Dongyang Wood Carving Factory has contracts filled for the next few years and products are in high demand, to open up tomorrow's market, it is necessary to rationally evaluate China's traditional crafts. To this end, Dongyang Wood Carving Factory has invited renowned architects, designers, interior decorators, artisans, and scholars from home and abroad to hold high-level academic seminars. The guests freely expressed their views, with praise, criticism, and suggestions.

Many domestic experts pointed out that Dongyang wood carving follows the Qing Dynasty tradition, reaching the pinnacle in technique, but the designs are too intricate. A camphor wood chest carved without leaving any space does not align with modern aesthetic tastes. They suggested that Dongyang wood carving should simplify, focus on the essence, reduce artificiality, and increase naturalness.

Lu Guangzheng listened and pondered. People spend 3/4 of their time indoors, so how to create a good indoor culture and environmental art is both a market issue and a quality issue. Dongyang wood carving needs to transcend, elevate, and reform.

　　开拓明天的市场
    ——浙江东阳木雕总厂厂长陆光正印象
    本报记者  刘霄
    雪白的西服，黑色的领带。身材矮小，却充满了自信。既是身怀绝技的木雕高手，全国６２位工艺美术大师之一，又是治厂有方的领导者：上任５年，把一个不景气的企业办得红红火火，年产值从原来的２００万元发展到２０００余万元，产品远销８０多个国家和地区。一个小县城里的贫民子弟，能够取得如此成绩，还有什么可抱憾的呢？
    但是陆光正觉得，东阳木雕应该在满足市场需求方面做出更大的贡献。他渴望把历史悠久的东阳木雕和现代建筑装饰、现代室内装饰完美地结为一体，在传统工艺和未来市场的结合部，创造出凤凰涅槃的奇迹。
    被称为“东方艺术珍品”的东阳木雕有着光辉的过去。精美绝伦的技法；清丽典雅的风格；诸多的传世之作，包括以北京故宫为代表的宫廷雕刻，以杭州灵隐寺释迦牟尼大佛为代表的宗教雕刻，以东阳卢宅为代表的民居雕刻，以１９１１年便开始出口的箱柜屏风为代表的家具陈设雕刻等等；还有饮誉海内外的前辈宗师，“雕花皇帝”杜云松，“雕花宰相”黄紫金，“雕花状元”楼水明。
    陆光正是“雕花状元”楼水明的传人。他从小就生活在一个充满灵性的氛围之中。在东阳，即使最普通的人家，也习惯于门窗上镂雕，桌椅上刻花。１９５８年，陆光正１４岁，进木雕厂学艺，楼水明看他资质不错，让他咬破手指写血书，发誓勤学苦练，收为关门弟子。
    陆光正把东阳木雕的发展壮大视为终生的责任。８０年代以来，东阳木雕总厂在联邦德国、美国、埃及、日本等国家承接了９０多项工程，其中“中国城酒楼”被誉为“中华民族装饰在西德的样板，”李光耀总理称赞“董宫酒家”是“目前为止新加坡最好的建筑雕刻”，并亲自为之剪彩。
    多少年了，东阳木雕主要依靠桌椅箱几之类的小雕刻为生，几乎淡忘了住宅建筑装饰的特色和大雕刻的优势。如今时代不同了。陆光正抓住契机，组建了东阳木雕营造公司。营造是手段，装饰是目的。几年来，这个公司在大江南北留下了他们的得意之作，从西湖豪华游船到江苏泰州梅兰芳纪念亭，从北戴河小东山的碧螺塔到湖南酃县的炎帝陵，从奉化溪口文昌阁的“奎阁凌霄”到天津广播电视大演播室，先后进行建筑装饰工程１００多项，不仅拓宽了传统的仿古营造道路，而且为东阳木雕留下了多姿多彩的纪念碑。
    陆光正以战略家的眼光，密切注视着中国新起的室内装饰热。他认为，尽管东阳木雕总厂明后几年的合同已经订满，产品供不应求，但是为了开拓明天的市场，应当对中国的传统工艺给予理性的估价。为此，东阳木雕总厂广邀国内外著名的建筑师、设计师、室内装饰师、工艺美术家以及学者教授，举行高层次的学术研讨会。来宾们畅抒胸臆，有肯定、有批评，更有建议。
    不少国内专家指出，东阳木雕师承清代传统，技法上是顶峰，但画面过于繁杂，一只樟木箱雕得毫无余地，和现代欣赏趣味存在距离。他们建议东阳木雕要做减法，要画龙点睛，要少些人工味，多些自然味。
    陆光正聆听着，思考着。人，３／４的时间生活在室内，如何创造很好的室内文化和环境艺术，这是市场问题，也是素质问题，东阳木雕要超越，要升华，要改革。
