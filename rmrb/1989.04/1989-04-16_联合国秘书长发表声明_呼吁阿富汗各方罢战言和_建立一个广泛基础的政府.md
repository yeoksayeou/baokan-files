People's Daily, United Nations, April 14th - Correspondent Liu Kai Chen reports: United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar issued a statement today here, calling on all parties in Afghanistan to cease hostilities and end the suffering of the Afghan people.

De Cuéllar also called for dialogue among Afghan parties to establish a government with a broad base. He reiterated his willingness to assist in achieving an early comprehensive political settlement of the Afghan issue.

De Cuéllar noted that recently, fighting in Afghanistan has intensified, resulting in continued heavy casualties among the Afghan people, with homes and property destroyed. Not only are the existing millions of Afghan refugees unable to return home, but the number of new refugees is also increasing. He expressed deep concern and regret over this situation.

De Cuéllar emphasized that all provisions of the Geneva Accords on Afghanistan should be implemented as a whole. He urged the parties to the Geneva Accords and the guarantor countries to fulfill their obligations under the Geneva Accords in good faith and in the interests of the Afghan people and peace in the region and the world.

De Cuéllar concluded by stating that the United Nations Observer Mission will continue to remain in Afghanistan and Pakistan until it completes its task of promoting and supervising the full implementation of the Geneva Accords.
