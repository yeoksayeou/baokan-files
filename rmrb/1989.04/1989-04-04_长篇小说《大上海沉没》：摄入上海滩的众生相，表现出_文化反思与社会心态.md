Perhaps it is a form of psychological adjustment for modern people? Living in the surging tide of life, one tends to prefer a macro overview of history to gain a reference system for understanding reality. The more one feels the inertia of social forces, the more one enjoys a panoramic view of reality to ponder one's own position within the grand backdrop. Excellent literature is precisely a marvelous lens that connects these two extremes. American scholar Rosenztweik said: In the 1970s, the number of American university students majoring in history decreased by 57%, but public interest in non-academic historical depictions, such as the documentary literature and television series like "Roots," surged, leading to a 25% increase in the number of local historical societies. Similarly, in today's China, the call for epic works is growing. Many Shanghainese and those who care about Shanghai are indignant:

Why is there no "Midnight" of the 1980s?

To satisfy this era's call is not easy. Today's readers are immersed in a dense network of mass media, accustomed to "close-up" social scans. Writers addressing the public must use deep historical insights and pioneering critical consciousness to sort through large volumes of social information and present it in an artistic form that gives people a strong sense of pleasure and beauty, in order to break through their "expectation horizon."

Middle-aged writer Yu Tianbai responds to this challenge with his new work, "The Sinking of Great Shanghai." The long-shot, panoramic scenes capture the countless faces of contemporary Shanghai, from struggling entrepreneurs and nostalgic businessmen to true Hong Kong residents and fake overseas Chinese, students and hoodlums, former workers of Metropolis Red and today's wealthy individual entrepreneurs, singers, officials, writers, mayors, prostitutes, "white gentlemen," and "con artists." They rush towards the reader like the crowd on Nanjing Road, bustling and noisy!

Multiple Angles of Psychological Penetration

The novel dissects the unique mindset of today's Shanghainese, that vague, inexpressible, yet genuinely accumulated "Shanghai Syndrome" in the process of Shanghai's decline. The group in the book all consider themselves "true Shanghainese," angry, frustrated, and disheartened by the decline of "my Shanghai," yet narrow-mindedly rejecting everything they see as "non-Shanghai." It's not necessary to mention how much the young businessman, who always talks about the "old days," despises people from Su North, nor how much the old supply worker hates outsiders who were "sent out and brought in." Just take the cadre who came south, Sha Peimin, for example. He has always been proud to be the master of Shanghai, but after hearing a neighbor's mockery, he suddenly lost his psychological balance:

"He thought of the scenes from thirty-seven years ago. Fighting to the death to occupy Great Shanghai; then struggling to settle in this picture-perfect Great Shanghai! Today, in that place, only a small broken room remains! In principle, in general, he had been driven out of Great Shanghai, tricked out by the cunning Shanghainese, and his daughter was also deceived!" But as he turned around, he also looked at the simple-minded son-in-law with a purely petty-bourgeois malicious gaze, the young worker who risked his life to dig the under-river tunnel for the Shanghainese! As an outsider in Shanghai, he despises the arrogance and narrow-mindedness of Shanghainese, but lacking a future-oriented vision and action, he only exacerbated the conservatism and decline of Great Shanghai! The author completes a powerful critique of Shanghai culture with the character of Sha Peimin.

Whose Fault? What to Do?

Flat social scans, deep psychological excavations, historical emotional tracking, and realistic cultural critiques, these intersecting points form a long-sounding question mark: "Whose fault? What to do?" What is truly meaningful is: when you immerse yourself in the novel's situation and communicate with the characters, you will deeply feel that today's "Shanghai Syndrome" is indeed understandable: the constraints of the old system, the turmoil of numerous movements, have drained Shanghai of much of its vitality; the various burdens of history and reality have put Shanghai people at a disadvantage in external competition, overpopulation and severe pollution have poisoned the minds of Shanghainese, making their strong desire for survival and development erupt in a distorted manner.

I believe: this is where the novel's true strength lies. It uses a vivid, relatable, and reflective panoramic view of Shanghai to let readers deeply understand what "Shanghai Syndrome" is, how it came to be, and also makes readers more acutely feel that to rid themselves of this syndrome and renew Shanghai culture is how difficult! As a Chinese reader who shares the same ecological and psychological traits with the characters in the book, you cannot disregard any utilitarian considerations and personal experiences to view "The Sinking of Great Shanghai"; and the macro perspective provided by the novel makes you strongly feel: without eliminating this "Shanghai Syndrome," Shanghai's revival is bleak.

Art, even in the form of a panoramic long novel, is not a city sociology survey report, nor is it an expert consultation team's strategy research, although the author has extensively absorbed and conducted research in this area. Its higher value lies in: it can awaken people to reflect on their own living conditions and cultural limitations, and arouse people's inner enthusiasm to transform this situation. It lets people feel an unavoidable inner pain when facing "The Sinking of Great Shanghai," and also gain a special sense of pleasure and beauty from savoring this novel world by objectifying the pain. If "The Sinking of Great Shanghai" is like a panoramic painting unfolding, then what illuminates this panoramic painting is the author's strong psychological beam—concern for reality, facing the future's Great Shanghai view, and a super-utilitarian, novelistic aesthetic Great Shanghai view, harmoniously unified.

Note: "Old days" is a Shanghainese term meaning "the past" or "those old days."

　　长篇小说《大上海沉没》：摄入上海滩的众生相，表现出
    文化反思与社会心态
    花建
    或许是现代人的一种心理调节吧？身在奔涌的生活大潮中，偏会喜欢历史的宏观概括，以获得体味现实的参照系；越是感受到社会的惯性推力的，越会喜欢现实的全景画，以揣摸这大背景上的自我。而优秀的文学，正是联系这两极的一块奇妙透镜，美国学者罗森茨韦克说道：７０年代主修历史学的美国大学生减少了５７％，而公众对非学术性的历史写照，如《根》这类纪实文学和电视连续剧却兴趣大增，以至于地方历史学会的数量猛增了四分之一。同样，在今日中国，呼唤史诗力作的舆论有增无减，许多上海人和关心上海的人们愤愤不平：
    为什么没有８０年代的《子夜》？
    要满足这种时代吁求并不容易。今日读者身居稠密的大众传播网中，见惯了“大特写”式的社会扫描。面向大众的作家必须用较深的历史见解和前驱的批判意识，去梳理大容量的社会信息，并给人以强烈快感和美感的艺术形式，才能突破他们的“期待视野”。
    中年作家俞天白以新作《大上海沉没》回答了这种挑战。长镜头横移式的场景，摄入了当代上海滩难以数计的众生相，力排万难的企业家、怀旧的商界小开、真港客和假华侨、大学生和小流氓、当年顾正红的工友和今日暴富的个体户、歌星、干部、作家、市长、暗娼、“白相人”和“拆白党”，就像南京路上的人流，拥挤着，喧闹着，向读者裹胁而来！
    多角度的心理锲入
    小说剖白了今日上海人的特有心态，那种在大上海衰落过程中说不清、道不白、但又确实郁积在胸的“上海病”。书中的那一群，无不以“真上海”自居，为“我的上海”在衰落而恼怒，而气闷，而沮丧，但又非常褊狭地排斥一切在他们看来的“非上海”之物。不必说言必“老底子”（注）的小开怎样厌恶“苏北人”，也不必说那个老供销员如何忌恨“拉出去，打进来”的外地人，就拿那个南下干部沙培民来说吧，他一向以上海的主人而自豪，可是在听了邻居小市民的一番讥讽之后，突然失去了心理平衡：
    “他想到了三十七年前那一幕幕。浴血奋战占领了大上海；接着又好不容易地住进了这幅图画中的大上海！今天，在那个地方，只留下了那么一小间破房子！从原则上讲，从总体上说，他已经被赶出了大上海，是给门槛精的上海人耍了手段赶出来的，同时又给骗走了女儿！”可是一转身，他也用纯粹小市民的刻薄眼光，挑剔着那个朴实的毛脚女婿，那个冒着生命危险为上海人掘通过江隧道的青年工人！作为上海的外来户，他瞧不起上海人的自大和狭隘，可是缺乏面向未来的眼光和作为，他反而更加剧了大上海的守旧和衰落！作者以沙培民的形象，完成了批判上海文化的有力一笔。
    谁之罪？怎么办？
    平面的世相扫描，深入的心理开掘，历史的世情追踪，现实的文化批判，这十字交叉的支点是一个警钟长鸣的问号：“谁之罪？怎么办？”真正意味深长的是：当你介入了小说的情境，和书中的人物沟通了心灵，你才会深切地感受到：今日之“上海病”实在情理之中：旧体制的束缚，多次运动的折腾，损耗了上海的几多生机；历史和现实的种种重负，使上海人在外向竞争中处于诸多不利，人口过密、污染严重，毒化了上海人的心态，使他们求生存、求发展的强烈渴望，以一种变形方式宣泄出来。
    我以为：这正是小说最见功力之处，它以可感可亲可反省的上海全景画，让读者深切体会到了究竟什么是“上海病”，它究竟因何而生，也让读者更痛切感到，要解脱这种病，更新上海文化是多么艰难！作为一个与书中人物生态相通、心态相通的中国读者，你不可能抛开任何功利的考虑和自身体验，来看待“大上海沉没”；而小说提供的宏观视野，又使你在对比中强烈地体会到：不消除这种“上海病”，上海的重振雄风是渺茫的。
    艺术，即便是全景画式的长篇小说，毕竟不是城市社会学的调查报告，也不同于专家咨询团的对策研究，尽管作者大量地吸收和进行了这方面的调研，但其更高的价值在于：它能够惊醒人们来反省自身的生存现状和文化局限，唤起人们改造这现状的内在热情。它让人们在直面“大上海沉没”时感受到难以回避的内心痛楚，又在玩味这个小说世界时获得一种把痛楚对象化的特殊快感和美感。如果说《大上海沉没》像一幅全景画翩然展开，那么照亮这一全景画的正是作者强烈的心理光柱——关注现实、面向未来的大上海观，和超功利的、小说审美的大上海观，两者的和谐统一。
    注“老底子”是上海话“从前”、“过去那年代”的意思。
