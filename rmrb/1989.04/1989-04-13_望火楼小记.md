	During dinner, I noticed that Xiao Qiao seemed a bit distracted, several times he held his bowl and looked towards Jianzi Ridge. He was young but had been the squad leader in this forestry police unit for two years. From his personality, he was the type to be mature beyond his years, introverted and calm.

	After putting down my bowl, I asked him what was wrong. He said he wanted to go up to the fire watchtower to take a look; he felt a bit of an ominous premonition. He spoke softly, a bit nervously.

	So, I followed him towards Jianzi Ridge.

	The deep autumn forest had a strong sense of layers, with birch, oak, poplar, and pine leaves of various colors weaving together under the soft yellow light of the setting sun, like being in a Van Gogh-like landscape of yellow hues.

	Xiao Qiao seemed completely indifferent to the autumn scenery before him, walking on his own, occasionally sniffing with his straight nose, as if he was searching for something.

	He saw me looking at him curiously and gave me a smile, asking, "Do you smell anything unusual?"

	I stopped and took a deep breath, only smelling the familiar bitter-salty and slightly sweet scent of the primitive forest.

	I shook my head, unsure.

	"There's a special burnt smell, maybe there's a forest fire somewhere far off!" He said, lifting his head to look towards the northeast. Obviously, the burnt smell he detected was coming from that direction.

	After hearing this, I no longer had the heart to appreciate the autumn mountain scenery, tightly following his footsteps up to the fire watchtower.

	The fire watchtower was built entirely of oak wood, about 20 meters high. We climbed the stairs. The soldier on duty was a young man with a baby face. It was understandable that Xiao, the squad leader, was worried. As soon as he reached the top of the tower, he asked, "Any situation?"

	"No, nothing unusual!"

	Xiao, the squad leader, took the binoculars and quickly adjusted the focus, observing intently for a moment, then suddenly exclaimed, "Quickly report to the command center, there is a fire alarm in the east of Xiongzhua Cliff!"

	I took the binoculars and looked, seeing a gray band of clouds in the distance, indistinguishable from the evening mist and household smoke. How could it be determined to be a fire alarm?

	Soon, a loud rumbling sound came from the distance, growing louder and louder, and in no time, the sound passed overhead. I discovered it was a large-bellied helicopter.

	"This is the command center's fire-fighting helicopter. A small-scale forest fire can be extinguished in an instant!" he said, seemingly very relaxed as he admired the surrounding mountains.

	On the way back to the camp, I asked him if he had some "special abilities," otherwise how could he have a premonition during dinner? He laughed: "This is thanks to my mother giving me a good nose, this ability is something I cultivated over the past two years." He finished speaking and laughed again, taking a long, deep breath.

	His expression was very rich at this moment, the earlier nervous feeling in my eyes immediately dissipated.

　　望火楼小记
　　曾凡华
    吃晚饭的时候，我就发现小肖有点心不在焉，几次把碗端到门口，往尖子岭方向打望。他年纪不大，却在这个森林武警中队当了二年中队长。从性格上看，他是属于少年老成、内向沉稳的那一类型。
    放下碗，我问他怎么了？他说得上望火楼看看，这会儿似有点不祥的预感。他说话细声细气，有点神经兮兮的。
    于是我跟他往尖子岭奔去。
    深秋的林子极有层次感，桦、柞、赤杨、樟子松等各色叶子，在斜阳淡黄的光晕里交织成一片斑斓的混合色，像置身于梵高黄色调意象画境。
    小肖似对眼前的秋景毫不在意，自顾自地走着，不时耸一耸直鼻梁，像是在探寻什么东西。
    他见我有些好奇地望着他，便冲我一笑，问：“嗅出什么异样的气味来了？”
    我停下步子，认真地嗅了嗅，只嗅出原始山林常有的那种苦咸又略带几分甜蜜的气息。
    我不置可否地摇了摇头。
    “有一种特殊的焦香味儿，可能是远处有山林着火了！”说着，他又抬头往东北方向望了一眼。显然，他嗅出的焦糊味是来自那个方向。
    听他这么一说，我也无心再去欣赏秋山林苑的景致了，紧紧踩着他的后踵，上了望火楼。
    望火楼是用青一色的柞木搭建的，高约20来米。我们拾级而上。上面值班的是个满脸娃娃气的小战士，肖队长适才不放心是可以理解的。他登上楼顶就问：“有情况吗？”
    “好像没有什么异常！”
    肖队长接过望远镜，迅速地调整焦距，凝神观察了一阵，突然放声说：“赶紧报告指挥所，在熊掌崖偏东方向有火警！”
    我拿过望远镜一看，发现前方弥漫着一片灰色的条子云，与傍晚的山岚、人家的炊烟没有什么两样，怎么判定就是火警？
    没多久，远方传来一阵隆隆的声音，愈来愈急，不一刻，响声便从头顶掠过去了，我发现是一架大肚子直升飞机。
    “这是指挥部的消防专用飞机，小规模的山火，它顷刻就能扑灭！”
    说到这，他似乎十分悠闲地欣赏起周围的山色来。
    在返回营地的路上，我问他是否有点“特异功能”，要不，怎么吃饭时就能有一种预感呢？他笑了：“这要感谢妈妈给我一个好鼻子，这功能是我这两年自己培养出来的。”说完又笑，作了个长长的深呼吸。
    他此刻的表情丰富极了，早先在我眼里那神经兮兮的感觉立即烟消云散……
