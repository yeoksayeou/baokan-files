The "Safe Haven" for Over-Quota Births

In recent years, the area around Sitan Township in my county has become a "safe haven" for over-quota births.

In a coal shed on Minqizhan Mountain in Sitan Township, I met a middle-aged couple. They are from Gaoling Township in Duan County. Now, they have three sons, the oldest is 8 years old, and the youngest is only 1 year old. They have been hiding in the mountains for over a year, relying on the man's coal mining to make a living.

Next to another private coal mine in Luchun Mountain, there is a small shed made of straw mats and bamboo. The male owner is from Xianxian Town in Shanglin County. This couple has two daughters in their hometown. In order to have a son, they moved their entire family to Sitan Township's coal mountain and gave birth to their third child in this small shed.

I also visited the couple Xiao Lan from Mashan County. They have two daughters in their hometown and also came here to have a son in 1986. Xiao Lan's wife gave birth to another girl in this "safe haven."

It is understood that the coal mountains in Shaping and Siping areas of Wutan Town in my county have also become "safe havens" for over-quota births, but relevant departments have not paid much attention.

### 超生户的“避风港”

　　超生户的“避风港”
    近几年来，我县四塘乡一带已成了超生户的“避风港”。
    在四塘乡民旗山的一个煤棚里，我见到一对中年男女，他们来自都安瑶族自治县高岭乡。现在，他们共生了３个男孩，大的８岁，小的仅１岁多。他们在山上“避风”已一年多，靠男人挖煤谋生。
    在陆村山另一口私人煤井旁，有一个用草席、竹子围起来的小棚子，男主人是上林县巷贤镇人，这对夫妇在家乡生了两个女孩。为了生个男孩，他们全家投奔到四塘乡煤山，在这个小棚子里生下了第三胎。
    我还走访了来自马山县的小蓝夫妇。他们在家乡生了两个女儿，也是为了再添一个儿子，１９８６年来到这里挖煤。小蓝的妻子在这个“避风港”里又生了个女孩。
    据了解，我县五塘镇的沙平、四平等一带的煤山，都成了超生户的“避风港”，未见有关部门重视。
