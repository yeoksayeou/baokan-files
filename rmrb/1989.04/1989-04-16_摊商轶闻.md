In Beijing, there is a group of street vendors who spend their days at billiard tables and bars, yet they still manage to earn several thousand yuan each month. I asked one of them about his business strategy. He mysteriously told me, "In the capital, there are over a million transient people, making it a buyer's market. To do business and make big money, the location of your stall is crucial. As long as the location is good and you take care of the relevant authorities, even if a fool is watching your stall, you'll still make a lot of money."

A young unemployed man obtained a permit from the Industrial and Commercial Bureau to sell fruits, and he was so excited that he couldn't sleep all night. He spent a month reading several books on business strategies and secrets to getting rich, both domestic and foreign. Then he conducted a survey of the market where his stall was located and formulated a business strategy of thin profit and high turnover, combined with excellent service to defeat his competitors. He also had the ambitious plan to develop into a large-scale wholesale and retail fruit market within two years. As soon as he started, the young man's strategy proved effective. Customers were attracted by his excellent service and low prices, and he sold 150 kilograms of various fruits in just one morning, netting 75 yuan.

The next day, he went to the market early again but was shocked by what he saw: his stall was filled with feces and urine. However, he didn't pay attention to it and continued with his thin-profit strategy. One week later, on his way home from closing his stall one evening, he was suddenly intercepted and beaten by three burly men. The minority's bullying behavior in the market had long been hated by the majority of honest people. Relevant departments took this incident as an opportunity to conduct a thorough rectification, which improved the business environment to some extent.

　　摊商轶闻
　　锦力
    （一）
    北京有这么一群摊贩，整日消磨于台球桌与酒吧，可他们每月仍有几千元的进款。我向其中一位讨教经营之道。他神秘地告诉我：“首都这地方，流动人口上百万，完全是买方市场，做买卖，想赚大钱，摊位所在地点最为重要。只要摊位好，对有关人员‘侍候’好，就是顾个傻瓜替你看摊，你都会大把地进钱。”
　（二）
    一待业青年从工商局批到一张经营水果的执照，激动得一夜未眠。他用一个月的时间翻阅了数本国内外关于经营之道、发财秘诀的书籍。然后对他所在摊群市场进行一番考察，制定了一个靠薄利多销、优质服务战胜竞争对手的经营战略，并雄心勃勃地计划在两年之内发展成为零售兼批发的大型水果商场。刚一上阵，小伙子的经营战略立即奏效。顾客都被他的优质服务和便宜的价格所吸引，一个上午就售出各类水果一百五十公斤，净赚七十五元。
    第二天，他又早早上市，却被眼前景象所惊呆：摊床不知被何人倒满屎尿。但他没理会，继续薄利经营。一个星期后的一天晚上，他收摊回家路上，忽然被三条大汉截住，揍了一顿。少数人欺行霸市的行为，正直的人早已痛恨在心。有关部门抓住此事进行一番整顿，才使这里经商环境有所改善。
