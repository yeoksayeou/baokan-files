The Zhongyuan Oil Field, which spans Henan and Shandong provinces, has recently decided to accelerate the exploration and development of the Shandong oil region. In April of this year, the Shandong Provincial People's Government and the China National Petroleum Corporation jointly established a battle command group. The focus of this year's exploration and development is on the Ma Chang and Qiao Kou oil fields and the Bai Miao gas field south of the Yellow River. It is expected that within the next two years, these oil and gas fields will achieve a production capacity of 100 million tons of crude oil and 2 billion cubic meters of natural gas. Currently, development work has already begun in stages.
