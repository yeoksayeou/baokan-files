	In Memory of Comrade Hu Yaobang
	Li Zhen

	Jiangchengzi

	Your voice, your smile, your image on the altar. I pour out my heart, weeping for a hero. My thoughts drift, and old tears fill my cheeks. Your loyal heart is like the sun and the moon, the streets mourn, hoping for your return.

	Dream after dream, what can be done? Remembering “Tie Niu,” vanquishing wolves and tigers. Joyful events, wave after wave enter my heart. Laughing and chatting, spreading good news, returning victorious, faces beaming with joy.

	After attending Comrade Hu Yaobang's funeral, my thoughts are endless. I recall that in those days, Hu Yaobang was the political commissar of my Third Column, and I served as the head of the political department in the Ninth Brigade of that column. In 1948, to prevent the enemy in North China from reinforcing the Northeast battlefield, thereby ensuring the complete victory of the Northeast Field Army in the Liaoshen Campaign, the Central Military Commission ordered the North China Northward Advance Corps (commanded by Yang Dezhi and with Luo Ronghuan as political commissar) to firmly hold back the enemy within the passes, codenamed the “Tie Niu” battle. Racing with two legs and car wheels was no easy task. At that time, the troops had many ideological issues. Political Commissar Hu Yaobang came to our brigade and gave a profound analysis and mobilization for the “Tie Niu” battle, which opened our minds and raised our understanding of strategic and tactical thoughts, making us feel more secure. Soon, the Liaoshen Campaign was victorious, and the Northeast and North China Field Armies met in the Pingjin area, thus achieving victory in the Pingjin Campaign.

　　悼念耀邦同志
    李真
    江城子
    音容笑貌奠灵台。寄衷肠，哭雄才。悠悠思绪，老泪满双腮。耿耿丹心如日月，长街痛，盼回来。
    连连幽梦奈何哉。忆“牵牛”，灭狼豺。赏心乐事，阵阵入心怀。谈笑风生传捷语，回嬴马，喜颜开。
    参加耀邦同志的追悼会后，思绪万千。忆当年耀邦是我三纵队政委，我在该纵队九旅任政治部主任。一九四八年，为箝制华北的敌人不能增援东北战场，以利我东北野军取得辽沈战役的全胜，中央军委命令我华北北进兵团（杨得志为司令员、罗瑞卿为政治委员）必须死死地拖住关内之敌，名曰“牵牛”战。用两条腿和汽车轮子赛跑谈何易。当时部队思想问题很多，胡耀邦政委来到我旅，对“牵牛”战作了精僻的分析和动员，使大家顿开茅塞，对战略战术思想的认识提高了，心里踏实了。不久，辽沈战役取得了胜利，我东北、华北野战军会师平津地区，从而取得了平津战役的胜利。
