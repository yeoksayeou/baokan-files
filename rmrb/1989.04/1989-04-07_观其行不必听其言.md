Title: Observe Actions, Not Words

Recently, the *People's Daily* supplement *Dadi* (February 27 and March 17) published articles by Shu Wu and Lou Shiyi. Reading them side by side is quite interesting. Especially Lou's article, in just a few hundred words, is full of wit. The phrase "observe actions, not words" hits the nail on the head, and I have a similar feeling after reading it.

In Chinese history, people have particularly valued "integrity" and "spine," especially for scholars. This should be considered a good tradition. This is not an overly demanding standard for scholars, but rather a special emphasis. Because the shoulders and pens of scholars bear the dignity of the nation and the conscience of humanity. "Shoulders of iron to bear justice, hands of pepper to write articles," only scholars with integrity can receive such high praise. Qin Gui, who passed the imperial examination, was naturally skilled in poetry and prose, but has any of his works been passed down? History records that "Yan Song entered the literary circle, known for his talent and fame, and wrote *The Bell Mountain Hall Collection* in thirty-five volumes." Now, even large libraries may struggle to find this book, but the play *Beating Yan Song* is frequently performed. Qian Qianyi was a leader in the literary world of the late Ming dynasty, but after he led the officials of Nanjing to surrender and become a traitor with the title of "Grand Guardian, Minister of the Ministry of Rites, and Academician of the Hanlin Academy," his reputation plummeted, and he was despised by the scholarly community. In a letter to his cousin, Qian Qianyi wrote: "In my youth, I stole empty fame, and in my old age, I am covered in dust. My glory has ruined my reputation, and I have barely escaped danger. There is nothing I can do to repay my life, and there is nothing I can write in the archives." These are his true feelings. The great poet Wu Mei, who was later summoned to surrender, although his bad reputation was slightly less than Qian's, was also ashamed for life. In his later years, he wrote: "My old friends are brave and have strange integrity, for the past few years they have been hesitant and unable to decide, secretly living in the grass. The smell of garlic and the smell of cucumber, today it is difficult to decide. To abandon one's wife and children is not an easy thing, but what is the use of saying it is worthless?" Their words are almost the same. Even more surprisingly, not only did the Ming loyalists of that time despise their poetry, but the early Qing emperors did not either. Qianlong cursed Qian Qianyi, saying, "He was originally a man of talent but without integrity. In the previous dynasty, he rose to high office, and at the beginning of our dynasty, he was the first to surrender, failing in his great duty, and was not worthy to be counted among humanity!" He also wrote a poem to mock him: "Talking about integrity all his life, serving two dynasties. Advancing and retreating without a basis, his articles have no light..."

I still believe in "the person reflects in the writing." Since articles are "emotions stirred within and expressed in words," it is hard not to reveal one's true feelings. The author can certainly say falsehoods, but the more false the article, the easier it is for the reader to see through the person. Wang Jingwei's seven-character quatrain is not surprising. The entire poem has a low mood, and even if judged purely as poetry, one can see the author's hesitant and sad state of mind. The last two lines, "Sadly not sighing like a lonely pine, reflecting on my life, I have not done my best," compared to Wen Tianxiang's "Since ancient times, who has not died, leaving behind a heart of loyalty to illuminate history," are simply not comparable.

I have a small reading "secret": any article, regardless of whether the viewpoint is correct or incorrect, or whether the language is skillful or clumsy, as long as it is sincere, it is worth reading. But if it is all show and no substance, fierce on the outside but weak on the inside, using clever words and deceitful arguments, covering up with empty words, then the author must have something to hide, and what he says is definitely not his true feelings. Such an article, even if you do not know the author's character, you do not need to read it.

　　观其行不必听其言
　　章明
    不久前《人民日报·大地》（２月２７日和３月１７日）先后发表了舒芜和楼适夷同志的文章，对照读来，饶有兴味。特别是楼文，寥寥数百字，妙趣横生。“观其行而不必听其言”，一语道破，读后颇有同感。
    在我国历史上，人们特别看重“气节”、“风骨”，对文人尤其如此，这应该说是一个好的传统。这也并非苛求文人，倒是格外看重的意思。因为文人的肩头笔下寄托着民族的尊严和人类的良知。“铁肩担道义，辣手著文章”，只有那些有骨气的文人才能得到如此崇高的褒扬。秦桧中过状元，自然长于诗文，但可曾有一字流传下来？史称“严嵩入词垣，负才名，著《铃山堂集》三十五卷”，现在恐怕大图书馆也难以找到这部书了，倒是《打严嵩》一剧常演不衰。钱谦益是明末的文坛领袖，但自从他以“太子太保礼部尚书兼翰林院学士”的尊衔率领南京众朝官迎降作伥之后，就声名骤落，“为士林不齿”。钱谦益晚年与族弟书云：“少窃虚誉，长尘华贯，荣进败名，艰危苟免，无一事可及生人，无一言可书册府。”这些倒是真心话。之后被征召降的大诗人吴梅村虽然恶名稍逊于钱，但也自愧终身，晚年作词云：“故人慷慨多奇节，为当年沉吟不断，草间偷活。艾炙眉头瓜喷鼻，今日须难决绝。脱屣妻孥非易事，竟一钱不值何须说！”他们二人说的几乎完全一样。更出奇的是，不但当时的明遗民鄙弃他们的诗文，就连清初诸帝也不例外。乾隆就骂钱谦益，说他“本为一有才无行之人，前明时身跻?仕，本朝定鼎之初率先投顺，大节有亏，实不足齿于人类！”又写诗挖苦他：“平生谈节义，两姓事君王。进退都无据，文章那有光？……”
    我还是相信“文如其人”的。既然文章是“情动于中而形于言”，就很难不流露出真心来。作者当然也可以说假话，但文章越假就越容易被读者看破其人。汪精卫的那首七律也不足为奇，全诗情调低沉，即使就诗论诗也可以看出作者彷徨悲观的心情。末两句“凄然不作零丁叹，检点平生未尽心”和文天祥的“人生自古谁无死，留取丹心照汗青”相比，简直不可同日而语。
    我有一个小小的读书“秘诀”：凡文章，不论观点正误，文词工拙，只要是出于真诚的就不妨一看。而如果虚张声势，色厉内荏，巧言诡辩，浮词掩饰，那么作者必定心中有鬼，他说的也决不是真心话。这样的文章就是不了解作者的为人，也不必看下去了。
