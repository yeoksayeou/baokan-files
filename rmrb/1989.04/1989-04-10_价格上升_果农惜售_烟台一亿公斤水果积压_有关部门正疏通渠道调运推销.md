Prices Rise, Farmers Hold Back Sales

100 Million Kilograms of Fruit Piled Up in Yantai

Relevant Departments Are Currently Clearing Channels for Transportation and Sales

According to a report published today in the Market News, as of the end of February, Yantai City in Shandong Province has accumulated 105 million kilograms of fruit, including 75 million kilograms of apples and 30 million kilograms of pears. Of the 105 million kilograms of accumulated fruit, 25 million kilograms are in the supply and marketing cooperative system of the city, while the majority are piled up with farmers and other operators.

Last autumn, the prices of apples and pears generally rose. The average purchase price for early autumn fruit in Yantai City reached over 1 yuan per kilogram, and for late autumn fruit, it was over 1.5 yuan per kilogram, with increases ranging from 0.5 times to several times. The significant rise in purchase prices drove up selling prices. Many farmers and operators, in order to capture the early market, picked apples before they were fully ripe, resulting in poor internal quality of the fruit. The price increase and quality decline made it difficult for consumers to accept. More importantly, in the context of the significant price increase last autumn, farmers and operators did not assess the situation but instead generally developed the mindset of "the higher the price, the more they want to hold back, the higher the price, the less they want to sell." Everyone wanted to store the fruit to make a big profit next year. In a suburb of Yantai City, a village that usually produces 15 million kilograms of fruit now has over 20 million kilograms piled up. The result of holding back sales is the opposite of what was intended. Currently, the fruit in Yantai City not only cannot be sold at last autumn's prices but also finds it difficult to find a market even at prices lower than last autumn, not to mention the losses from spoilage. Farmers generally reflect that while it is important to do a good job in fruit production, it is even more important to do a good job in sales. It is understood that relevant departments in Yantai City are currently clearing channels and organizing forces to transport and sell the fruit to reduce losses.

　　价格上升　果农惜售
    烟台一亿公斤水果积压
    有关部门正疏通渠道调运推销
    本报讯  据今天出版的市场报报道：截至２月下旬，山东省烟台市已积压水果１．０５亿公斤，其中苹果７５００万公斤，大梨３０００万公斤。积压的１．０５亿公斤水果中，除市供销社系统有２５００万公斤外，大部分都积压在果农和其他经营者手中。
    去年秋天，苹果、大梨价格普遍上升，烟台市早秋果每公斤平均收购价达到１元以上，晚秋果１．５元以上，升幅从０．５倍至几倍不等。收购价大幅度上升，带动了销价的上涨。不少果农和经营者为了抢早市，苹果不到成熟期就提前下树落果，造成水果内在质量差。价格上升，质量下降，使消费者难以接受。更重要的原因是，在去年秋天水果价格大幅度提高情况下，果农和经营者不是审时度势，而是普遍产生了“越贵越想贵，越贵越不卖”的惜售思想，人人都想储存水果来年发大财。烟台市郊有一个村，往年水果总产量为１５０万公斤，而现在却积压了２００多万公斤。惜售的结果，事与愿违，目前烟台市的水果不仅卖不到去年秋天的价格，而且比去年秋天价格低也难找到销路，加上损耗，更是得不偿失。果农普遍反映：搞好水果生产很重要，做好销售工作更为重要。据了解，烟台市有关部门目前正疏通渠道，组织力量调运推销，以减少损失。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（柳径祥）
