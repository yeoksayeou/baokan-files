Xinhua News Agency, Washington, April 6th.

The State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, said today that President Bush has decided to send an envoy to the Afghan Seven-Party Alliance provisional government in Pakistan. However, the United States will not formally recognize the resistance government at this time.

Boucher said that President Bush and Secretary of State Baker have decided to grant the envoy the rank of ambassador. She did not reveal the name of the appointee, although today's New York Times reported that Baker had recommended Peter Tomson, the acting charge d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, as the envoy.

She said that although the government has decided to send an envoy to the Afghan resistance government, this does not constitute formal recognition or the establishment of diplomatic relations.

　　美国总统布什决定
    向阿七党联盟临时政府派特使
    据新华社华盛顿４月６日电  美国国务院发言人塔特怀勒今天说，布什总统已决定向在巴基斯坦境内的阿富汗七党联盟临时政府派遣一名特使，但美国目前不会承认抵抗力量政府。
    塔特怀勒说，布什总统和国务卿贝克决定授予这一特使以大使衔。但她没有透露这一任命的人选，虽然今天的《纽约时报》透露说，贝克于上周五曾向布什推荐驻华使馆临时代办彼得·汤姆森为特使人选。
    她说，虽然政府决定向阿抵抗力量政府派遣特使，但这并非正式承认或同这个政府建立外交关系。
