Madrid, the capital of Spain, has a population of 3.6 million and is the headquarters of the United Nations World Tourism Organization. Spain attracts 40 million foreign tourists annually, exceeding its own population. The country earns $8 billion in foreign exchange from tourism each year, making it a major tourist destination globally.

1981 marked the 100th anniversary of Spain's tourism industry. That year, Madrid hosted the first International Tourism Expo, inviting tourism organizations from various countries to set up booths and showcase their tourism projects, culinary arts, dining, and cultural features. Since then, the annual International Tourism Expo has become a regular event.

Madrid is located in the central Meseta Plateau, at an altitude of 670 meters, making it the highest capital city in Europe. To facilitate tourists' access to Madrid, several airports have been specially constructed. One-third of the tourists arriving in Madrid come by air, with hundreds of flights daily transporting tourists to various domestic tourist spots.

Spain allows free entry and exit for citizens of the European Economic Community. Europeans particularly enjoy self-driving tours, with over a million French citizens alone driving to Spain each year to explore its sights.

Within Spain's borders lies the Mediterranean "Sunshine Coast," boasting over 300 sunny days a year, stretching 150 kilometers in length. The climate is mild, with a swimming season lasting over half the year. This makes it an "ideal" tourist destination. Therefore, Spain is often referred to as the "country exporting sunshine and beaches."

　　“出口太阳和海滩”的国家——西班牙
　　解启逵
    西班牙首都马德里，现有人口三百六十万是联合国旅游组织总部所在地。西班牙每年吸引外国游客四千万人，游客超过本国人口，年收入外汇八十亿美元，是世界上的旅游大国。
    一九八一年是西班牙创办旅游业一百周年，马德里在这年举行了首届国际旅游博览会，邀请各国旅游组织设馆参加展出，宣传各自的旅游项目及烹饪、饮食、文化特点。自此以后，一年一度的国际旅游博览会就成了常规。
    马德里位于内陆中心梅塞塔高原上，海拔六百七十米，是欧洲最高的首都。为了便于游客进入马德里，特别修建了多个机场以资应用。来此旅游的游客三分之一是乘飞机来的，每日有上百架班机将游客转运到国内各旅游点。
    西班牙允许欧洲共同体各国公民自由出入，而欧洲人最喜欢自驾汽车出游，仅法国每年就有上千万人自驾汽车游览西班牙。
    西班牙境内拥有一年三百多个睛天的地中海“太阳海岸”，全长达一百五十公里，冬暖夏凉，可供游泳的季节有半年以上，是“得天独厚”的旅游地。因此，西班牙被称为“出口太阳和海滩的国家”。
