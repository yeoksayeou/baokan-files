	Beijing College Students Take to the Streets in Protest
	City Government Spokesperson: This Protest Was Unauthorized
	State Council Spokesperson Welcomes Students' Request for Dialogue

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 27th - Tens of thousands of students from various universities in Beijing took to the streets today, carrying banners and shouting slogans.

	At 8 AM, students from some universities began gathering in their campuses, preparing to march. School leaders and teachers, out of concern for the students, tried to persuade them to stay. Some students heeded the advice and did not participate in today's protest, but a significant number still took to the streets.

	Relevant departments of the Beijing Municipal Government and public security officers repeatedly tried to persuade the students, but to no avail.

	The main slogans chanted by the protesting students included: Support the Communist Party, support the Constitution, support the four cardinal principles, eliminate corruption, and bring down the "official profiteers," among others.

	Public security officers maintaining public order strictly adhered to discipline and adopted a restrained attitude. Throughout the more than ten-hour protest, no conflicts occurred.

	Because the protest march proceeded along major streets in the capital, many onlookers gathered, causing severe traffic congestion.

	The Beijing Municipal Government spokesperson pointed out that this protest was unauthorized and violated Beijing's ten regulations on protests.

	The spokesperson said that the broad masses of young students' desire to eliminate corruption and promote democratic progress aligns with the Party and government's wishes. However, there are indeed a few individuals who aim to create disorder. He called on all citizens of the city to maintain social order, production order, scientific research and teaching order, and the normal order of people's lives.

	The spokesperson said that since the students support the leadership of the Communist Party, support the four cardinal principles, and support the Constitution, they should return to class as soon as possible according to the Party and government's requirements. All illegal organizations must be immediately disbanded. Students who have gone out to link up should return to school as soon as possible.

	It is reported that the State Council spokesperson also made a statement today regarding the student protest, welcoming the students' request for dialogue. He said that the Party and government have always advocated direct dialogue with the masses, but dialogue must have the right atmosphere and must be conducted in an appropriate manner.

	In the evening, the protesting students gradually dispersed.

　　北京高校学生上街游行    
    市政府发言人指出：这次游行未经批准   
    国务院发言人对学生要求对话表示欢迎
    新华社北京４月２７日电  北京部分高校数以万计的学生今天打着横幅，喊着口号，走出校门，上街游行。
    早晨８点，一些高校学生开始在校园里聚集准备上街。学校一些领导和教师从爱护学生出发进行了耐心的劝阻。有些学生接受了劝阻，没有参加今天的游行，但仍有一批学生上了街。
    北京市政府有关部门和公安干警曾多次耐心劝阻，但均未能奏效。
    游行学生呼喊的口号主要内容有：拥护共产党，拥护宪法，拥护四项基本原则，消除腐败，打倒“官倒”等等。
    维持公共秩序的公安干警严守纪律，采取了克制态度。在长达十多个小时的游行过程中，没有发生冲突。
    由于游行队伍沿着首都主要街道行进，围观群众很多，致使交通受到严重堵塞。
    北京市政府发言人指出，这次游行未经批准，违反了北京市关于游行的十条规定。
    这位发言人说，广大青年学生要求消除腐败，推进民主进程的心情，同党和政府的愿望是一致的。但当前确有极少数人想制造动乱。他要求全市人民维护社会秩序、生产秩序、科研教学秩序和人民生活的正常秩序。
    这位发言人说，既然学生拥护共产党的领导、拥护四项基本原则、拥护宪法，就应该按照党和政府的要求尽快复课。所有非法组织必须立即解散。外出串联的学生应该尽快回到学校。
    据悉，国务院发言人今天也就学生游行一事发表谈话，对学生要求对话表示欢迎。他说，我们党和政府一直主张与群众直接对话，但对话必须要有对话的气氛，必须采取适当的方法进行。
    傍晚，游行的学生逐渐散去。
