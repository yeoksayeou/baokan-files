The joy of moving often comes with the worry of moving.

In Beijing, 1988, nearly 100,000 households received new homes, and an additional 56,000 households exchanged residences. Across the city, approximately 150,000 families welcomed the joy of moving.

However, after receiving the keys to their new homes, many found themselves troubled: moving is not an easy task. How to transport a large number of bulky furniture and boxes to a high-rise building? Finding help is difficult, borrowing a vehicle is difficult...

Just as people were worrying about moving, good news arrived: the first moving company in the country, Li Kang Moving Company, was established in Shiliupu, outside Chaoyangmen in Beijing. Anyone needing to move can simply dial 5001155-203. From the moment it opened, the phone never stopped ringing, and many people even came to the door seeking help.

A football coach from the China Railway Sports Association requested their services. The coach thought, usually when repairing a door or a water pipe, one still has to offer tea and cigarettes. Moving is a big deal, even though they said they wouldn't eat or drink, we can't be negligent. He prepared a large amount of food and drinks in advance to warmly entertain them, but he didn't expect the movers to work efficiently and carefully, with everything intact. They only charged less than 200 yuan for the moving fee, not even drinking a drop of water.

Last year, the state decided to convert the former residence of the late writer Lao She into the Lao She Memorial Hall and allocated a new residence for Lao She's wife, Hu Xieqing. Hu Xieqing requested Li Kang Company to assist with the move. Her home had many books, paintings, and numerous antiques, crafts, potted plants, and fresh flowers, making the move quite challenging. The workers carefully wrapped the books and paintings, and for items that couldn't be packed together, they patiently carried them up and down, working tirelessly for an entire day. They drank water they brought themselves and ate at a nearby small restaurant, refusing the host's repeated invitations to drink water or smoke. When settling the account, they strictly followed the regulations and charged 300 yuan for the moving fee. Hu Xieqing felt guilty and insisted on paying an additional 100 yuan, but the company's staff firmly refused to accept it. The 80-year-old Hu Xieqing was deeply moved and, with great enthusiasm, wrote a couplet for Li Kang Company on the spot. The upper couplet reads: "Spring breeze brings warmth, moving relies on Li Kang," and the lower couplet reads: "The earth returns to spring, and customs are renewed."

In the newly built apartment building of the Chinese Writers' Association, there are many stories about this company. Last April 28th in the afternoon, Li Kang Company moved for the Mongolian poet Chagan. Chagan's new residence is on the 18th floor. Two trucks of items had just been moved halfway when the elevator suddenly broke down, and it couldn't be repaired immediately, causing everyone to be anxious. Chagan's wife helplessly told them, "Your task is complete, just leave the items on the ground floor, and we'll figure out a way to move them upstairs tomorrow!" What to do? The team leader, Song Shuangyue, and the workers discussed and decided that helping people means helping them to the end, and they can't leave the items on the ground floor overnight. They divided the workers into three shifts, relaying the items from the 1st, 6th, and 12th floors. Relying on human strength, they managed to move a truckload of items to the 18th floor, exhausting themselves and soaking their clothes with sweat. Chagan was deeply moved and bowed deeply to thank them.

Li Kang Moving Company has been in business for over a year and has already helped more than 2,800 households move into new homes. Additionally, the company has handled moving services for enterprises and institutions such as the China Electronics Import and Export Company, the Technical Department of China Central Television, the China Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Company, and foreign trade companies in Beijing. Among those who requested their services, intellectuals were the majority, and there were also many ordinary workers. A middle-aged worker named An moved from a courtyard house near Guanyuan to a new residential building in Lianhuachi and requested the moving company's help. Someone advised him not to spend money on outsiders, as friends could help with the move. This worker said, "Finding a few friends to help with the move is no problem, and we can borrow a car, but during the move, we can't let friends go hungry, we have to buy some cigarettes and alcohol, and prepare a decent meal, which would cost at least a hundred or two hundred yuan. Moving and cooking, it's tiring and expensive, and we also owe a lot of favors. Hiring a moving company saves a lot of trouble, and two rooms only cost 150 yuan."

The management and employees of Li Kang Moving Company are full of enthusiasm and confidence in their work. Manager Chen Lianfang pays great attention to learning from the advanced experiences of economically developed countries. He said, "In recent years, the moving industry has developed rapidly in various countries around the world. Japan alone has tens of thousands of moving companies, with the largest being the Aoto Moving Center. This company, established in 1973, was originally a small regional company, but it has now developed into a large enterprise with more than 30 branches nationwide, with an annual profit of 14 billion yen. This company offers more than 300 service items, including packaging furniture and daily items for customers, pest control, disinfection, transferring students, changing phone numbers, car registration, interior design, renovation, purchasing new furniture, disposing of old items, etc." Manager Chen believes that with the development of China's economy, the continuous improvement of people's living standards, and the change in consumption structure, the moving industry has a bright future and there are many things that need to be done and can be done. For example, some intellectuals' homes have only elderly couples who lack the ability to handle various old household appliances; some people want to renovate their newly allocated homes and update some furniture but are unable to do so...

To adapt to this new situation, the moving company decided to expand its business. Recently, they merged with an interior decoration company and changed the company's name to Beijing Moving and Decoration Company. The team has grown, and the service content has increased to include interior renovation, electrical installation, purchasing new furniture, disposing of old furniture and old appliances, cleaning the house before moving, disinfection, etc., providing residents with one-stop service.

Following Beijing's moving company, Shanghai, Shenyang, Nanjing, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Dalian, Shijiazhuang, Guangzhou, and other cities have also successively established more than 20 moving companies. This new urban service industry has opened up a new path for China's urban tertiary industry.

　　利康首创搬家公司受到首都居民的欢迎    
    今日乔迁不用愁
    本报记者  李茜
    乔迁之喜往往连着“乔迁之忧”。
    北京，１９８８年，就有近１０万户居民分到了新房，再加上５．６万户调换房屋，全市约有１５万多个家庭迎来了乔迁之喜。
    然而，他们拿到新居钥匙之后，又往往愁上眉梢：搬家可不是件轻松事，如何把一大堆笨重的家具箱笼搬上高楼？请人难，借车难……
    正当人们为搬家发愁的时候，喜讯传来：全国第一家搬家企业——利康搬家公司在北京市朝阳门外十里堡成立。谁要搬家，拨５００１１５５—２０３电话就行。开业伊始，电话不断，许多人还找上门来求助。
    火车头体协有位足球教练请他们搬家。教练想，平时请人修个门窗、水管，还得烟茶招待，搬家是件大事，虽然人家说不吃不喝，咱们可不能怠慢。他事先买了一大堆吃喝的东西准备热情招待，没料到搬家的人们家搬得干净利索，一切东西完好无损。只按规定收了不到２００元钱搬家费，滴水不沾。
    去年国家决定将已故作家老舍的故居辟为老舍纪念馆，给老舍夫人胡絜青另拨了一套新宿舍。老舍夫人请利康公司帮助搬家。她家里藏书多、字画多，还有许多古玩、工艺品、盆栽鲜花，搬动很不容易。工人们小心翼翼地把书画包裹整齐，不便打大包的物件，不厌其烦，一趟趟搬上搬下，整整忙了一天。他们喝的是自己带的水，到附近小饭馆吃的饭，不管主人怎样热情邀请，他们都没喝一口水，没吸一支烟。结账时按规定收了３００元搬家费。胡絜青不过意，一定要多付１００元，利康公司的业务人员坚决不收。８０多岁的老舍夫人非常感动，她满怀激情地当场挥毫为利康公司写了一副对联，上联是：春风送暖搬家赖利康，下联是：大地春回奋志正民俗。
    在中国作家协会新建宿舍大楼里，传说着不少有关这个公司的美谈。去年４月２８日下午，利康公司给蒙古族诗人查干搬家，查干的新居在１８层楼上。两汽车东西刚搬了一半，电梯突然坏了，一时间不能修好，大家都心急如焚。查干的妻子无可奈何地对他们说，你们的任务就算完成了，把东西放在楼下，明天我们自己想办法搬上去吧！怎么办？带队的宋双跃和工人们一合计，帮人就得帮到底，不能把东西扔在楼下过夜，一定要把它送到用户家里。他们将人分作３班，在１层、６层、１２层接力搬运，就凭人抬肩扛，硬是把一汽车东西搬上１８层楼，一个个累得精疲力竭，衣服被汗浸得能拧出水来。查干感动得向他们深深鞠躬致谢。
    利康搬家公司开业一年有余，已经帮助２８００多户迁入新居。另外，公司还承担了中国电子进出口公司，中央电视台播送、制作、技术部，土畜产进出口公司等企事业单位，以及外国在京商社的搬家业务。请他们搬家的人中，以知识分子居多，一般职工也不在少数。有位姓安的中年工人从官园附近的平房迁入莲花池新住宅楼，请搬家公司帮助。有人劝他不必花钱请外人，朋友们帮把手就行了。这位工人说，找几个哥们帮忙搬家不成问题，车咱也能借到，可搬家时总不能让朋友饿肚子，得买点烟、酒，做上一点像样的饭菜，这一折腾，至少一二百元，搬家连带做菜，累个“臭死”，钱也不少花，还欠下一大笔人情债。请搬家公司省许多事，两间房也就花了１５０元。
    利康搬家公司的干部和职工对自己的事业都充满了热情和信心。经理陈连芳很注意学习经济发达国家的一些先进经验。他说，近几年世界各国搬家行业发展很快，日本已有数万家搬家公司，其中以阿托搬家中心规模最大。这个企业１９７３年建立时只是一个地区性小公司，现在已发展成在全国有３０多个分公司的大企业，年盈利额达１４０亿日元。这家公司的服务项目多达３００余种，包括为客户整理包装家具和杯盘等日用杂品、除虫、消毒、代学生转学、改换电话、汽车注册、室内设计、装修、代购家具、处理废品等等。陈经理认为，我们国家随着经济建设的发展、人民生活水平的不断提高和消费结构的改变，搬家业大有发展前途，需要做和可能做的事情很多。比如，有的知识分子家里只有老俩口，没有能力处理更新下来的各种旧家用电器；有的人想装修一下新分到的房子、更新一些家具却无能为力……北京几十万户乔迁居民，提出了门类繁多的服务项目，许多人不断找到搬家公司门上，要求给予帮助。
    搬家公司为了适应这种新的形势，决定扩大业务，不久前他们合并了一个室内装饰公司，把本公司改名为北京市搬家装饰公司。队伍发展了，服务内容增加了室内装修、电器安装、代购新家具、处理旧家具和旧电器，搬家前清扫房屋、消毒等等，对居民实行一条龙服务。
    继北京搬家公司之后，现在上海、沈阳、南京、天津、杭州、大连、石家庄、广州等城市，也已先后开设了２０多个搬家公司。这项新兴的城市服务事业，为我国城镇的第三产业开拓了一条新路。
