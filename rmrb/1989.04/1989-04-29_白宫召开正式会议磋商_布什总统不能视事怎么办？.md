White House Holds Formal Meeting to Discuss What Happens if Bush Cannot Perform Duties

		The People's Daily, Washington, April 27 (Reported by Cang Lide) — What if U.S. President Bush is unable to perform his duties? A high-level White House official announced today that President Bush and his wife, along with Vice President Quayle and his wife, discussed this issue last week and determined the conditions under which Quayle would assume the presidency as acting president. It is believed that holding such a formal meeting to discuss this matter is unprecedented in White House history.

		According to reports, the meeting was held on April 18 at the White House. Participants included White House physician Burton Lee, White House advisor Boyden Gray, and several White House officials. During the meeting, the presidents and vice presidents jointly determined the specific conditions under which Quayle would assume presidential powers according to the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, but the details were not disclosed. The amendment, passed in 1967, stipulates that when the president submits a written statement to the leaders of both houses of Congress stating that he is unable to perform his duties, the vice president can take over presidential powers; additionally, when the vice president and a majority of the cabinet declare that the president is unable to perform his duties, the vice president can also become the acting president.

		This amendment has never been invoked. However, scholars have long called for the White House to establish a succession procedure. They cited two examples: shortly after Reagan's inauguration, there was a "chaos" in the White House when he was shot and injured; when Woodrow Wilson suffered a stroke and was paralyzed and unable to perform his duties, he still retained the presidency for more than a year.

		White House officials said that the documents invoking the 25th Amendment have been drafted and are kept in the White House in case of emergencies. One of the two drafters of the amendment, former Senator Birch Bayh, said today, "We all hope the president will be healthy and long-lived, but history teaches us that it is best to be prepared for the unexpected."

　　白宫召开正式会议磋商    
    布什总统不能视事怎么办？
    本报华盛顿４月２７日电  记者仓立德报道：万一美国总统布什因故不能视事怎么办？白宫一位高级官员今天宣布，布什总统夫妇和奎尔副总统夫妇上周就此事进行了磋商，确定了在何种情况下奎尔以代理总统身份接管总统职权。据信，召开这样的正式会议讨论此事在白宫历史上还是头一遭。
    据此间报道，会议是４月１８日在白宫举行的，参加者还有白宫医生博敦·李、白宫顾问波登·格雷及一些白宫官员。会上总统、副总统夫妇共同确定了奎尔按照第２５条宪法修正案规定接管总统职权的特定条件，但详情没有透露。１９６７年通过的这项修正案规定，当总统向国会两院领导人递交书面声明说他不能行使总统职权时，副总统可以接替总统职权；另外，当副总理及内阁多数成员宣布总统不能视事时，副总统也可成为代理总统。
    这项修正案从未被援用过。但一些学者一直强烈要求白宫确定接替程序。他们引用的两个事例是，在里根总统就职后不久遇刺受伤后曾引起白宫的一场“混乱”；当伍德罗·威尔逊总统中风瘫痪不能履行职责后，还保留了一年多总统职位。
    白宫官员说，援引第２５条修正案的文件已起草完毕并保存在白宫内，以防不时之需。该修正案的两名制定者之一，前参议员波奇·贝今天表示，我们都祈愿总统健康长寿，“但历史教导我们最好还是做好准备，以防不测”。
