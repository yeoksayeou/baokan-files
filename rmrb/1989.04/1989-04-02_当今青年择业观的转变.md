	The Changing Employment Views of Today's Youth
	From "Status-Oriented" to "Economically-Oriented." For a long time, young people's primary criterion for choosing a career has been the social status associated with that profession. However, many unemployed youth today prioritize economic benefits above all else.

	From "Permanent" to "Trial-Oriented." In the past, many people hoped to find a good job and then settle down, content to stay in one place. But now, many young people approach their first job with a "let's see how it goes" attitude. If they like it, they stay; if not, they move on, no longer clinging to jobs they find unsatisfactory.

	From "Impatient" to "Wait-and-See." With the further development of a commodity economy, job opportunities are becoming more plentiful. Therefore, young people's urgency to find a job is not as great as before. To some extent, they often choose jobs based on whether they align with their interests.

	From "Inward-Looking" to "Outward-Looking." Under the impact of the open-door policy, many young people hope to venture out into the "outside world" rather than confine their job search to their immediate surroundings.

　　当今青年择业观的转变
    从“地位型”向“经济型”转变。长期以来，青年们选择职业的首要标准是某种职业在社会上的地位高低。但目前很多待业青年则不然，他们首先考虑的是经济待遇如何。
    从“永久型”向“飞鸽型”转变。以前许多人总希望找到一个比较好的职业就不再“这山望着那山高”，安安稳稳地度日。但眼下很多青年刚上岗时就带着“试试看”的心理，干得好就干，干不好就走，不再抱着自己并不理想的职业“死守”。
    从“急就型”向“等待型”转变。随着商品经济的进一步发展，就业机会愈来愈多，因此，青年们就业的要求已不如以往急不可待。在一定程度上，他们往往从是否符合自己的兴趣出发来选择职业。
    从“内向型”向“外向型”转变。在开放大潮的冲击下，很多青年希望到“外面的世界”去闯一闯，而不愿仅仅囿于自家门前的小圈子里择业。
