The leader of the failed coup in Haiti, Lieutenant General Henri Namphy, along with two other high-ranking military officers involved in the coup, were expelled to the neighboring Dominican Republic by the Haitian government today. The capital, Port-au-Prince, has begun to return to normalcy, signaling the end of the two-day political crisis.

Meanwhile, Washington has denied that Assistant Deputy Secretary of State for Caribbean Affairs Richard Melton handed over a list of Haitian military officials involved in drug trafficking and an ultimatum to the Haitian government during his meeting with President Leslie Manigat last week. It is believed that the list, allegedly provided by the U.S., prompted Manigat to take action against military officials linked to drug trafficking, which ultimately led to the failed coup. Melton stated that during his meeting with Manigat last week, they only discussed issues related to democratization, economic development, and human rights.

　　政变头目被逐　海地危机结束
    本报墨西哥城４月４日电  记者郭伟成报道：海地星期日未遂政变的头目雷布，以及另外２名参与政变的高级军官，今天被海地政府驱逐到毗邻的多米尼加共和国。首都太子港已开始恢复平静，宣告持续两天的政治危机结束。
    与此同时，华盛顿方面否认美国国务院加勒比事务助理副国务卿理查德·梅尔顿上周在太子港与阿夫里尔会晤时，曾交给海地政府一份关于海地军官参与贩毒的名单和有关的最后通牒。据认为是美国提供的名单促使阿夫里尔向军中与贩毒有关的军官开刀，从而导致了这次未遂政变。梅尔顿说，他与阿夫里尔上周会晤时只谈论了民主化、经济发展与人权问题。
