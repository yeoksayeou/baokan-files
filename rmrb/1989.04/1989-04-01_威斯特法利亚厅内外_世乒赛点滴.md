Inside and Outside the Westphalia Hall
- World Table Tennis Championship Moments

Two Collectors

The corridor of the Westphalia Hall was almost as bustling as the competition arena. The promotional stands of the sponsoring companies, the stalls selling table tennis equipment and souvenirs, were one after another. However, the most attractive were the exhibitions of two collectors.

One is the British man Gerald Gurner. His collection can be considered a "world's best." In 1885, when table tennis first became popular in Britain, the gentlemen of high society first played it on the tables of their clubs. The earliest tables are now collected by Gurner. For 30 years, Gurner has scoured flea markets and second-hand stores, and anything related to table tennis equipment, books, and postcards has been within his sight.

The other is the 39-year-old Dutch journalist Adrie van der Lelyen. He specializes in collecting various types of table tennis balls. For 20 years, he has been enthusiastic about this, bringing his collection all over the European continent. A few balls have become antiques, such as the two table tennis balls produced in 1905 and 1910, which are now worth 10 pounds each. Table tennis manufacturers are familiar with him, and they send him new products first.

Lost the Bet but Still Happy

The chairman of the West German Table Tennis Association, Gepp, and the soon-to-be coach of the West German women's team, Miss Yeller, bet 100 marks. Yeller said that the West German men's team would not be drawn in the same group as the world powerhouse South Korea in the second round of the competition. Gepp said they would be. Upon the draw, Yeller won, and Gepp paid up. However, he was quite happy, saying, "Because the draw results are in our favor!"

Postage Reduction - Reporters Cheer

During the World Table Tennis Championship, the busiest were probably the reporters and the postal system of the news center. According to the regulations of the West German post office, the cost of using the post office's fax machine is calculated based on the number of pages and distance, making the communication costs to East Asia and North America very high. A South Korean reporter sent 5 pages of manuscript, costing 150 marks, and he was complaining bitterly. The Dortmund Post Office heard the news and immediately decided to give special treatment, changing the calculation to the call time (like a personal fax machine). On the morning of the 31st, the reporters saw the postage reduced significantly and were overjoyed.

A "Building" Supported by One Person

Encountering the president of the Philippine Table Tennis Association, Mr. Huang Jinqing, when talking about the table tennis movement in the Philippines, it was known that this "table tennis building" was supported by him alone. Due to the tight government budget, table tennis did not receive financial support from the government, and it was all funded by his personal pocket. He used to play table tennis and loved this sport. Despite taking tens of thousands of dollars from his company's profits every year to promote this sport, he still enjoyed it.

　　威斯特法利亚厅内外
    ——世乒赛点滴
    两位收藏家
    威斯特法利亚厅的环廊简直比赛场还热闹，赞助公司的宣传阵地，出售乒乓器材和纪念品的摊位一个连一个，不过最有吸引力的还是两位收藏家的展览。
    一位是英国人杰拉尔德·居尔内，他的藏品堪称一项“世界之最”。１８８５年乒乓球首先在英国兴起时，上流社会的绅士们首先是在俱乐部的饭桌上挥拍小乐的，最初的几张球台现在就被居尔内收藏着。３０年来，居尔内跑遍跳蚤市场和旧货商店，凡乒乓器材、书籍、明信片，都在他的视野之内。
    另一位是３９岁的荷兰记者阿德利·范德利伦，他专门搜集形形色色的乒乓球。２０年来他乐此不疲，带着自己的藏品走遍了欧洲大陆。有几个球已成古董，如１９０５和１９１０年生产的两只乒乓球于今已经价值１０英镑一个。乒乓球厂商都熟悉他，有了新产品先寄给他。
    赌输了反而高兴
    西德乒联主席盖普和即将就任西德女队教练的耶勒尔女士以１００马克打了个小赌。耶勒尔说，西德男队第二阶段比赛抽签不会和世界强队南朝鲜抽进一组，盖普说会。一揭晓，耶勒尔赢了，盖普乖乖交钱。不过他倒高兴得很，连说：“因为抽签结果对我们有利呀！”
    邮费降价　记者称快
    世乒赛上，最忙的大概是记者和新闻中心的邮政系统了。按西德邮局规定，使用邮局的传真机费用以页数和距离计算，这样一来，远东和北美的通讯费用甚高。一个南朝鲜记者发了５页稿子，费用高达１５０马克，叫苦不迭。多特蒙德邮电局闻讯，当即决定予以特殊照顾，改以通话时间（如同私人传真机一样）计算。３１日一早，记者们看到邮费大减，喜不自胜。
    一人支撑的“大厦”
    路遇菲律宾乒乓总会会长黄金庆先生，谈起菲律宾乒乓球运动，才知这座“乒乓大厦”是他一个撑起来的。由于政府经费紧张，乒乓球从政府方面得不到财政支持，全凭他个人掏腰包。他过去打过球，酷爱这项运动，尽管每年从自己的企业收益中拿出几十万去促进这项运动，他仍乐于此道。
