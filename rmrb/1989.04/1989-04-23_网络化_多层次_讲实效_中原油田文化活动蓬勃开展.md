The Zhongyuan Oilfield, located in Puyang, Henan, is a new enterprise in the petroleum industry. With 200,000 employees spread across two provinces, four cities, and 12 counties over an area of more than 5,000 square kilometers, the dispersed nature of production activities and distance from major cities present challenges for employee cultural activities. In response, the oilfield's Party Committee and trade union have integrated cultural development with production, gradually creating a vibrant and active cultural life that is networked and multi-level.

To address the high mobility and dispersed nature of petroleum production, the oilfield has established multi-level cultural activity centers, focusing on the construction of libraries, cultural activity rooms, sports fields, and film projection stations. The oilfield has set up fixed venues in its subordinate units, with libraries, cultural activity centers, sports fields, and film projection stations distributed across more than 20 bases. Among these, 12 multi-functional clubs have been built. The headquarters of the oilfield has a 20,000-square-meter clubhouse equipped with a gymnasium, swimming pool, television broadcast station, and other facilities. At the grassroots level, various amateur cultural activity groups and artistic associations have been established. The oilfield has over 60 interest groups, including reading, stamp collecting, fishing, and pigeon racing.

The focus is on both popularization and improvement. Amateur cultural activity groups have a wide range of participants and diverse forms of activities, which are organized irregularly. Various levels of trade unions and propaganda departments pay attention to gradually moving from mass-based activities to professionalization. The oilfield has established the Zhongyuan Song and Dance Troupe, which performs and provides guidance at the grassroots level every year, cultivating local talent. The troupe's "Zhongyuan Oil Song" has won the second prize in the All-China Trade Union Federation's performance and the second "Television Art Star" award. Yan Li and Dou Xue have won the gold award for vocal solo in the "Yellow River Bank" music festival. In sports, several projects have also won places in the National Workers' Sports Games.

While paying attention to industry-specific characteristics, social benefits are also considered. The petroleum industry in the 1950s had popular songs like "I Dedicate Oil to My Country." Today's petroleum workers enjoy singing popular songs and dancing, needing new "oil praises." Each year, various levels of artistic performance teams in the oilfield create a certain number of programs reflecting the lives of petroleum workers.

The oilfield is a small society. All forms of cultural entertainment popular in society are also developed in the oilfield. The management of the oilfield believes that oilfield cultural activities should not be closed off. All healthy and beneficial activities that the masses enjoy should be supported to attract more participation. In the past year, the oilfield has held beauty contests, fashion shows, popular song and dance competitions, and various knowledge contests.

The oilfield engages in joint operations with professional art troupes. The oilfield's trial production company has collaborated with local art troupes to establish a joint art enterprise.

　　网络化　多层次　讲实效    
    中原油田文化活动蓬勃开展
    本报讯  记者毕胜、大农报道：地处河南濮阳的中原油田是石油战线的一个新兴企业。２０万名职工分布在二省４市１２个县、方圆５０００多平方公里。生产活动分散，远离大城市，给职工文化活动带来困难。对此，油田党委和工会把抓企业文化建设同抓生产结合起来，逐步形成了网络化、多层次的文化生活活跃兴旺的局面。
    针对石油生产流动性大，野外作业分散的特点，油田成立了多级文化活动中心，重点抓馆、场、室、站的建设，油田先后在下属的基层单位设立了固定的场所。图书室、文化游艺馆、运动场、放映站等活动场地分布在２０多个基地。其中，多功能的俱乐部修建了１２个。油田总部的一幢２万多平方米的俱乐部设有体育馆、游泳池、电视转播台等。在各基层单位成立了业余文化活动小组和各种文艺协会。油田读书、集邮、钓鱼、信鸽等各种“兴趣小组”已达６０多个。
    抓普及与提高相结合。业余文化活动小组参加人员广泛，形式活泼多样，不定期地开展活动。各级工会和文宣部门又注意在群众性的基础上逐步向专业化方向提高。油田成立了中原歌舞团，每年深入基层演出的同时进行辅导性的演出，为基层培养人才。该团的《中原油歌》先后获全总工会会演二等奖和第二届电视文艺星光奖。阎丽、窦雪荣获“黄河之滨”音乐会声乐个人金奖。在体育方面也有不少项目在全国职工运动会中获名次。
    注意行业性特点的同时并注意社会性效益。石油战线在五十年代曾有脍炙人口的《我为祖国献石油》等歌曲，今天的石油工人爱唱流行歌曲，爱跳交际舞，需要新的“石油赞歌”。油田各级文艺演出队每年都要创作一定数量的反映石油工人生活的节目。
    油田是一个小社会。社会上流行的文化娱乐形式都在油田得到开展。油田管理局领导认为，油田文艺活动不能搞封闭性，凡健康有益、群众喜爱的各种活动形式都应给予支持，才能吸引大家参加。油田去年以来举行健美比赛、服装表演、流行歌舞比赛和各种知识竞赛。
    搞企业与文艺专业团体联营。油田的试采公司与当地文艺团体联营，成立企业文艺联合体。
