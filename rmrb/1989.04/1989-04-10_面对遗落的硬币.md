	Facing the Dropped Coin
	Wáng Xiǎo Lěi

	“On the side of the road, I picked up a coin, and handed it to the policeman’s hand…” This song was the first one I learned as a child. Perhaps it was because of its influence that when I picked up money, even if it was just a small coin, I would immediately hand it over to the teacher. In my eyes, it was such an honorable thing to do! But now, if someone picks up a five-cent coin and hands it to the police, they might receive a look of contempt.

	One day, during morning exercises, I suddenly noticed two five-cent coins lying on the ground. The students in front of me clearly saw them, but they just stepped over them. A classmate next to me shouted, “Who dropped the coins?” Seeing no one respond, he kicked them with his foot and walked away. I gently picked them up and handed them to the class representative: “Use them for class funds!” She did not move her hand, which was in her pocket, but just turned her body and said, “Oh, you keep them, it’s just a little bit…” She did not finish her sentence. At that moment, I noticed a crowd of people around me, almost all with expressions of contempt and confusion. Suddenly, I felt as if I were holding a red-hot iron plate in my hand, my face burning with embarrassment, and an invisible pressure made me confused. What should I do? It seemed the class representative would not accept it; if I kept it, the consequences would be predictable. It seemed I could only let it fall back to the ground…

	After this incident, my heart felt heavy for a long time. Only after thinking for a long time did I find a “good” way to explain it: “It seems that now, people no longer pick up things they find on the road.” But a few days later, another incident proved me wrong again.

	One day, as I was walking to school, a female classmate in front of me dropped a few coins while taking out her handkerchief. They fell to the ground with a sound, but she seemed not to have heard it. I caught up to her and said, “Classmate, you dropped some money.” She looked me up and down and muttered, “Making a fuss over a few cents, country bumpkin.”

	What kind of mentality is this! Indeed, reform has made some people rich first, but does being rich mean one can waste? Some people, in front of others, like to show off their wealth, using waste to satisfy their pathetic vanity. One day, the newspaper reported: “A primary school student used 1 yuan to pay a classmate to pick up his pencil (note that the pencil was right next to him, and he was not disabled).” Alas, this is the way of today’s “respectable” people. Waste, for some families now, seems no longer to be seen as the behavior of a spendthrift. However, we still have a larger family, and in this larger family, some people still have difficulty with basic sustenance. Since we “respectable” people can generously throw away money, why can’t we generously give some to our fellow countrymen? Some say coins are a small matter, is this really a small matter? If every one of China’s billion people drops one cent every day, the vanity satisfied by this one cent will increase day by day. In the end, maybe they will throw away ten cents, a hundred cents, a thousand cents…

	China is not yet rich, and we cannot afford this kind of vanity, this kind of so-called “generosity.” Pick up the small coins, put away the vanity. Do not wait until it is too late to fix.

### 面对遗落的硬币……

　　面对遗落的硬币……
    王小蕾
    “我在马路边捡到一分钱，把它交给警察叔叔手里边……”这支歌是我小时候学会的第一支歌。也许是受了它的教育吧，当我捡到钱时，哪怕只是一个小小硬币，也要马上交给老师。在我看来那是多么光荣的事情啊！可是，现在如果有人捡起五分钱交给警察，却可能会得到鄙夷的目光。
    一天，上操的时候，我忽然发现地上躺着两个五分硬币。前面的同学分明看见了，但一抬腿过去了。旁边的同学喊了一句：“谁丢硬币了。”他见无人答应，便用脚踢了一下，走了。我轻轻地拾起它们，递到生活委员手里：“当班费吧！”她插在兜里的手并没有动，只是扭着身子说：“唉，你装着吧，这么点……”后面的她没有说。这时，我发现身边围了一堆人，脸上几乎都带着鄙夷和不解的神色。顿时，我觉得手中抓的不是硬币而是一块烧红的铁板，脸烫得要命，一种无形的压力使我迷惘了。怎么办？看来生活委员不会收下它；如果我收起它，那后果可想而知。看来只得让它重新回到地上了……发生这件事后，我的心总是沉甸甸的，想了很久之后才找到一个“好”的解释方法：“看来，现在已路不拾遗了。”但没过几天，另外一件事又一次证明我错了。
    一天，我正往学校去的路上走，前面的一个女同学在拿手绢时带出了几枚硬币，落地有声，但她似乎没听到。我追上去说：“同学，你掉钱了。”她上下打量了一下我，嘟囔了一句：“几分钱就大惊小怪的，乡下佬。”
    这是一种怎样的心理呀！的确，改革使一些人先富了起来，然而富就可以浪费吗？有的人在人前时，爱摆一下自己的阔绰，用浪费来满足自己那可怜的虚荣心。一天，报纸上登了一则消息：“一位小学生用１元钱作代价让同桌同学给他捡铅笔（请注意铅笔就在他旁边，他也并非残废）。”呜呼，这就是当今“体面人”的做法。浪费，对于现在的一些家庭来说似乎已不被视作“败家子”行为了。然而，我们还有一个大家，在这个大家里有一些人温饱还成问题。既然我们这些“体面人”能慷慨地扔，为什么不能慷慨地奉献一些给自己的同胞呢？有人说硬币是小事，难道这真是小事吗？如果中国十亿人口每人每天丢弃一分，用这一分垫起的虚荣心会与日俱增，到后来也许会扔十个一分，一百个一分，一千个一分……
    中国还不富裕，要不得这种虚荣心，要不得这种所谓的“慷慨”。把小小硬币拾起来吧，把虚荣心收起来吧。不要等到不可收拾的地步，到那时就晚了。
