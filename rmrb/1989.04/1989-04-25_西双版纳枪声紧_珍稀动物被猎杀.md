In the 360,000-acre natural reserve of Xishuangbanna, Yunnan, elephants, wild oxen, black bears, and other rare animals continue to be hunted.

From January to December last year, within the natural reserve, 16 wild oxen, 2 elephants, 2 leopards, 8 black bears, and over 70 other animals including deer, peacocks, pythons, and sloths were killed. These figures are only from the cases that have been solved; there are many more unsolved cases. The hunters include not only locals but also outsiders who drive into the area to hunt. Last year, 25 people were arrested for hunting.
