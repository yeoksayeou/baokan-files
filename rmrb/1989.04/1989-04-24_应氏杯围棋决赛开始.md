The first Yingshi Cup World Professional Go Championship final will commence on April 25th. The match will take place by the picturesque West Lake in Hangzhou, where the birds sing and the flowers bloom. Beijing's Nie Weiping, 9th dan, and Seoul's Cho Hunhyun, 9th dan, have both arrived here to prepare for the final showdown, a best-of-five series, to compete for the championship prize of $400,000. Cho Hunhyun arrived in Hangzhou from Seoul yesterday. He has long admired the beauty of Hangzhou and, upon seeing it for himself, found it to be as magnificent as he had imagined. He expressed his determination to play well and not disappoint the beautiful scenery of West Lake. Cho, who entered the professional ranks at the age of nine, has won numerous titles in South Korea, amassing over 90 championships by October 1988, earning him the nickname "Title King." His skill is unparalleled in the South Korean Go world. Recently, he defeated Konishi Katsuya and Honda Kunihisa, 9th dan, in the second Fujitsu Cup World Go Championship, demonstrating his excellent competitive form. This time, he comes with great momentum and is expected to pose a significant threat to China's "Go Saint," Nie Weiping.

Nie Weiping, who arrived in Hangzhou earlier, is using bridge as a form of relaxation and "warm-up" before the big match.

The Go championship began in Beijing last August. The final was originally scheduled to be held in Hangzhou and Ningbo, China, but after several changes, it was decided to hold two matches in Hangzhou and one in Ningbo. If the series ends 3-0, the championship will be decided, and the event will conclude. If the series ends 2-1, the event will be temporarily suspended, and the schedule and location for the remaining matches will be determined later. The dates for the first three matches are April 25th, April 28th, and May 2nd.

　　应氏杯围棋决赛开始
    本报杭州４月２４日电  记者温子建报道：第一届应氏杯世界职业围棋锦标赛的冠亚军决赛，２５日将在西子湖畔的鸟语花香之中怡然开枰。北京的聂卫平九段和汉城的曹薰铉九段俱已抵达这里，预备做五局三胜制的最后决战，争夺高达４０万美元的冠军奖金。曹薰铉是昨天从汉城来到杭州的，他说他对美丽的杭州心仪已久，亲临一看果然名不虚传，他表示一定要下好棋，不辜负优美的西湖景致。九岁入段的曹薰铉曾多次获得南朝鲜年度全部棋战的冠军，至１９８８年１０月已拥有９０多个冠军头衔，人称“头衔王”。其水平独居南朝鲜棋坛。最近他在第二届富士通杯世界围棋锦标赛中连胜小林光一和本田邦久九段，显示了良好的竞技状态，此次挟气而来，估计将对中国的“棋圣”聂卫平造成极大威胁。曹九段曾与聂九段两度交手，平分秋色。
    较早来到杭州的聂卫平以打桥牌做为大赛前的最后休息和“热身”。
    本届围棋锦标赛是去年８月在北京开幕的。决赛原订在中国的杭州和宁波两地决出冠军，后几经波折，改为在杭州赛两场，宁波赛一场，如３比０则本届赛事闭幕，如打成２比１则赛事暂告一段落，后面比赛的日程和地点另定。前三盘棋的比赛时间是２５日、２８日、５月２日。
