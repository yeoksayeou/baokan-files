Edition: 4

Over the past few years, the publishing departments in Inner Mongolia have produced over 110 books that have won national and provincial awards, with more than 150 books entering the international market, gaining popularity among readers both domestically and abroad.

Based on surveys of social needs, they have conducted topic selection and planning, formulating a publishing strategy that emphasizes both regional characteristics and ethnic features. The Inner Mongolia People's Publishing House has released a series of Mongolian history books, including the "Annotated Edition of the Secret History of the Mongols" and the "New Translation and Annotation of Mongolian Origins," which have attracted attention and praise from domestic and international scholars. These books have also been reprinted and distributed in Hong Kong and Japan. The Inner Mongolia Culture Publishing House, in an effort to promote Mongolian culture, has compiled and published books such as the "Dictionary of Mongolian Idioms," "A Brief History of Buryat Mongols," and "Geser Khan," which reflect Mongolian language, historical texts, and customs. These books have not only entered the book markets in Japan and West Germany but have also been translated into foreign languages.

In addition to publishing Mongolian-language books, various publishing houses in Inner Mongolia have also produced a number of high-quality Chinese-language books. The "Practical Electrical Engineering Q&A" edited by the Inner Mongolia People's Publishing House has been reprinted three times, with a total print run of over 430,000 copies. The revised edition, "2,000 Practical Electrical Engineering Questions and Answers," with an initial print run of 340,000 copies, was quickly sold out upon release. The "Flora of Inner Mongolia" has been praised by botanists from the Soviet Union, the United States, Switzerland, and Japan as a comprehensive and well-illustrated flora. The first ten volumes of "Hutchison's Internal Medicine" have garnered significant attention from domestic and international peers. The Des Company in the United States is willing to provide a new edition and has displayed the Chinese version of "Hutchison's Internal Medicine" in the Copyright Library.

In addition to editing and publishing primary and secondary school textbooks, the Inner Mongolia Education Publishing House has compiled and published Mongolian-language textbooks for higher education, filling a gap in the history of Mongolian cultural education publishing in China.
