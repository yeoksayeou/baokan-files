Art has commodity attributes. In today's commodity society, it is increasingly rare for artists to remain aloof and avoid discussing money. For those who aspire to art, it is now necessary to maintain a certain level of "elegance" to focus on their craft and strive for perfection. Lin Sanzhi once said, "I have grasped the divine inspiration and put it into practice," which was the result of his "enduring hardships for eighty years." The words "enduring hardships" encapsulate the spirit of an artist's pursuit and the loneliness, solitude, and hardships they endure. Without this, one cannot achieve greatness. Recently, a colleague from Renmin Art Gallery lamented: "Nowadays, we can't collect paintings." Given Renmin Art Gallery's status, the paintings they can't collect are certainly not ordinary works. Where have they gone? They have flowed out through various channels. To put it bluntly, many artists are selling their paintings directly to foreigners.

As a result, the state loses tax revenue, the national painting market becomes chaotic, and national paintings depreciate.

Now, the national painting market needs attention. Many of the works displayed for sale are substandard, products created by artists for money; prices are chaotic. Some units even organize large-scale exports, selling at prices far below the international market. Another phenomenon is the proliferation of fake paintings across the mainland, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, North America, and Western Europe. Some unscrupulous individuals are freely producing forgeries, using ugly imitations to tarnish the reputations of many outstanding Chinese painters, including the late Xu Beihong, Qi Baishi, Fu Baoshi, Pan Tianshou, Shi Lu, and Li Keran. Forging famous paintings and works by renowned artists is a criminal act that infringes on the artists' reputation and financial rights, and should be punished by law. But currently, there are no laws to depend on.

This is a distorted cultural phenomenon.

From the perspective of cultural exchange, Chinese readers can easily list a large number of famous Western painters, while Xu Beihong and Huang Bin Hong are barely known abroad. Indeed, Eastern and Western arts have different thoughts, cultures, and social backgrounds. Without understanding these backgrounds, it is difficult to recognize and appreciate the exquisite and ingenious secrets of their art. We have introduced and continue to introduce Western art, but the promotion of Chinese painting abroad is comparatively lacking. Western readers know very little about the brilliant Chinese paintings, and thus cannot distinguish between genuine and fake works or recognize their value. I recall that at a certain international auction house, a work by Van Gogh sold for tens of millions of dollars, while a painting by the great Song Dynasty artist Ma Yuan sold for only tens of thousands of dollars, a difference so vast that it is heartbreaking.

Therefore, Chinese painters and art historians have a duty to educate Western readers. Fan Zeng has expressed his intention to write such a book, briefly outlining the historical development of Chinese painting and popularly explaining the philosophical, ethical, and aesthetic backgrounds of different periods and schools. This would indeed be a good thing.

Returning to the topic, Fan Zeng signed a contract with Renmin Art Gallery to hand over all his new works, limited to domestic sales (including Taiwan), to Renmin Art Gallery for exclusive operation each year. Each sold work will come with a "Fan Zeng Original Work Certificate" to prevent forgeries. This will gradually reduce and eventually eliminate the possibility of his works being forged, maintaining the artist's reputation and increasing the state's income. This is a wise move and a manifestation of the artist's self-respect.

Spiritual products cannot be measured by material standards. Although no one can escape the constraints of the commodity economy, artists have a responsibility to help the national painting market move in the right direction.

　　国画市场随想
　　卢祖品
    艺术具有商品属性。在目前商品社会，艺术家一味清高讳言阿堵物的是越来越少了。对于有志于艺术的人说来，现在倒需讲点“清高”，以便潜心艺业，精益求精。林散之自谓“得了天机入了手”，那是他“大力煎熬八十年”的结果。“煎熬”二字，道尽了艺术家的求索精神与求索中的孤独、寂寞与艰辛。舍此不能成就大事业。荣宝斋的同志日前感慨说：现在收不上画。以荣宝斋的档次，收不上的，当非泛泛之辈的画。哪里去了？通过多种渠道外流了。说白一点，许多画家直接把画卖给外国人了。
    于是国家减少了税收，国画市场混乱，国画贬值。
    现在，国画市场该引起注意了。在那里陈列叫买的，许多是次品，即画家为了金钱而生产的产品；价格混乱。有些单位甚而组织大量出口，以低出国际市场许多许多的价钱销售海外。另一个现象，假画赝品泛滥于大陆，台湾，港澳，新加坡，马来西亚，日本，北美，西欧。一些不法分子肆意制造假画，以丑陋的伪作，使我国好些优秀画家蒙受无穷无尽的不白之冤，远及已故的徐悲鸿、齐白石、傅抱石、潘天寿、石鲁、李苦禅等。伪造名画和名家作品是侵犯画家名誉财权的犯罪行为，应该绳之以法。但现在无法可依。
    这是一种畸形的文化现象。
    再从文化交流的角度看。中国读者能扳着指头举出一大批西方著名画家的名字，而徐悲鸿、黄宾虹在国外却鲜为人知。诚然，东西方艺术有着不同的思想、文化、社会背景，不了解这种背景，就难以认识、理解其精绝、奇巧的奥秘所在。我们介绍过并且至今仍在介绍着西方艺术，中国画的对外介绍工作比较起来就差得多了。西方读者对光辉灿烂的中国画知之甚少，也就无从辨别真伪认识其价值。记得在某个国际拍卖行上，一幅凡高的作品售价高达数千万美元，我国宋代大画家马远的画只卖一万多美元，相差如此之大，令人心酸。
    因此，中国画家和美术史家有义务对西方读者进行启蒙教育。范曾表示要写这么一本书，简述中国画的历史发展，通俗阐释不同时期不同流派发生、发展的时代的、哲学、伦理、美学的背景，未始不是一件好事。
    话说回来，范曾同荣宝斋签订合同，每年把在国内（包括台湾）限额销售的新作全部交给荣宝斋独家经营，每幅作品售出时附上“范曾作品真迹证书”以防伪赝。这将逐步减少并进而彻底杜绝自己作品被伪造的可能性，既可维护画家声誉，又给国家增加收入，不失为明智之举，也是画家自爱自重的表现。
    精神产品是不能用物质来衡量的。虽然谁也逃不出商品经济的大限，但画家有责任帮助国画市场走上正确的道路。
