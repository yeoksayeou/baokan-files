In the evening, we drove to the "Three Treasures" Dam in the Ten-Li Dong Village of Rongjiang County, Guizhou Province, intending to rest for a while. Unexpectedly, we "bumped into" the "Elderly Home." Taking advantage of the elders' lively conversation, I chatted with them.

Reporter: From what I understand, self-established elderly organizations in minority villages are still rare. Could you introduce the basic situation of the elderly group here?

Yang Guangrong (77 years old, leader of the elderly group in Kouzai Village): Sure. In our Zhongbao Township, three villages have voluntarily established elderly groups. The Kouzai Village elderly group was established in 1981 and now has 33 elderly members, with the oldest being 88 years old and the youngest 63. In the past, we old men had nothing to do all day, and after a long time, we felt quite bored. We thought, rather than being idle and miserable, it's better to take the lead and start planting trees, which is beneficial for both ourselves and the village. Since then, the tree-planting task in Kouzai Village has been entrusted to our elderly group. Since 1982, we have planted more than 60,000 trees and have been commended by the prefecture and county seven times. In the past, it was hard to find even a single tree branch in the mountains, but now we see saplings growing in our hands, and we can't describe how happy we feel!

Reporter: Besides planting trees, do you also do other tasks within the village that you can handle?

Yang Fajing (70 years old, former head of Zhongbao Township, retired in 1980): Yes, like patrolling the village, guarding the ponds and courtyards, mediating disputes, and protecting forests from fires, all these tasks are managed by the elderly. Last May, villager Huang Shengji (blind) accidentally started a fire while roasting firewood at home. At noon, all the villagers were out working, and our elderly group immediately rushed to extinguish the fire, preventing a major disaster.

Yang Guangrong: Now, many young people blame us elders for setting obstacles and playing the "bad guy" in marriage issues. Actually, in this matter, we elders also have our uses. Just last month, two couples in the village "eloped," and the parents of the girls were emotionally hurt. We quickly went to mediate and reconcile. It's still the elders' words that carry weight. After our multiple visits to mediate, both sets of parents reconciled, and the two couples finally got married. Once the young people get married, we actively encourage them to practice family planning. Because we did the work in advance, the 33 grandchildren of the elderly have not had any cases of overpopulation, and Kouzai Village has been rated as a "civilized village" by the higher authorities many times!

Reporter: The reason Kouzai Village has been rated as a "civilized village" many times is inseparable from your active participation, elders. Elders appropriately participating in productive activities can serve society and cultivate themselves.

Wu Zhengxing (88 years old): As the saying goes, "Old age love is deeper than youth." Elders can't stand loneliness. Why do the villagers call me "Youth in Old Age"? First, I get along well with young people, without any generation gap, unlike the ancient saying "old friends are dear, young friends are distant." Second, I often exercise, maintaining a youthful appearance despite my age. I have never had a cold. I often go fishing by the river and birdwatching in the woods. I am always calm and never sigh about old age or poverty, so naturally, I am free from diseases.

Yang Xirong (73 years old, traditional Chinese medicine practitioner): Time doesn't wait for anyone! I used to work at the Rongjiang County Hospital, and before I knew it, I was old and retired. I once had a sense of loss. I can't stand being lonely, so I opened a private clinic to treat the villagers. Additionally, I organized a Dong opera troupe, recruiting 18 performers. I often teach them songs like "Dinglang and Longnv," "Liu Shifan," "Ye Lang," and "Qin Niang Mei." The Dong opera troupe has performed in Guiyang, Kunming, and Liuzhou, and has been well-received.

Reporter: I heard that in the Dong area, elders are highly respected, and it is said that "having an elder at home is a treasure." Young people regard respecting, caring for, and supporting elders as their duty. Generally, when people reach fifty or sixty, their sons and daughters-in-law no longer let them do farm work.

Yang Guangrong: That's right. I have sons and daughters, and they are very filial to me. Since my wife passed away, my responsibility fields have been divided among them. My daughters-in-law also care for me a lot. Knowing that elders like to eat bland, soft, and warm food, they often cook chicken soup, beef soup, pork rib soup, and mung bean soup for me. Fruits and other "meat and vegetables" are all cut, cleaned, and stewed for me to eat. No one is more considerate than them.

Reporter: This is truly "having a place to live, having something to do, and having something to enjoy" in old age. I sincerely wish you all a happier old age.

　　晚霞满天
    本报记者  郭嘉
    夕照时分，我们驱车来到贵州省榕江县十里侗寨的“三宝”大坝，本想在此稍憩片刻，不意“撞”进了“老人之家”。乘着老人们谈兴正浓，我同他们聊了起来。
    记者：据我了解，目前在少数民族村寨里自发成立老人组织的还很少，能否给我介绍一下这里老人组的基本情况？
    杨广荣（７７岁，口寨村老人组组长）：好的。在我们中宝乡，有３个村已自发成立了老人组。口寨村老人组是１９８１年成立的，现有３３位老人，年龄最大的８８岁，最小的６３岁。以往，我们这些老头子整天无事可做，日子长了觉得怪腻烦的。我们想，与其闲着难受，还不如带个头起来造林，于己于村，都有好处。从那时起，口寨村的植树任务就归我们老年组了。１９８２年以来，我们共植树６万多株，先后７次受到州县的表彰。过去山中连一根树枝都难找，现在看到一片片树苗在我们手中长大，心里别提有多高兴了！
    记者：除了植树外，在寨内，你们还做些其它力所能及的活吗？
    杨发经（７０岁，原中宝乡乡长，１９８０年退休）：有哇，像寨里敲梆打更、看塘护院、排难解纷、防火护林的事，都是由老人来管。去年５月，村民黄胜基（双目失明）在家烤柴，不慎引起火灾。中午时分，全村劳力出工未归，我们老人组马上前往扑救，避免了一场大祸。
    杨广荣：现在有不少年青人骂我们做长辈的在婚姻问题上设路障、唱“白”脸，其实在这件事上，我们老年人也有有用的地方。就说上个月吧，村里有两对情人“私奔”，女方父母感情受刺激，我们赶紧劝解、疏通。还是老年人说话有份量，经过我们多次上门调解，双方父母重归于好，两对情人终成眷属。年轻人一旦结婚，我们就积极动员他们计划生育。由于工作做在前，３３个老人的孙媳妇无一例超生，口寨村多次被上级评为“文明村”哩！
    记者：口寨村之所以屡次被评为“文明村”，是同你们老人的积极参与分不开的。老人适度地参加生产活动，既能服务社会，又能修身养性。
    吴正兴（８８岁）：俗话说，老来情比少时浓。老人最容不得孤寂了。寨里人为什么称我“晚年青”？一是我和青年人相处得好，没有什么“代沟”，不像古人说的“情于故人重，迹共少年疏”；二是经常活动，修得鹤发童颜。我这般年纪还从未感冒过。有空到河边网网鱼，去林中遛遛鸟。总是心平气和，从不叹老嗟贫，自然百病不生。
    杨希荣（７３岁，老中医）：年岁不饶人啦！我原在榕江县医院工作，一晃人就老了，离休后我也曾一度有过失落感。我这个人向来耐不得寂寞，于是，就办了个私人门诊部，为乡亲们看病。此外还组织了一个乡侗戏班子，招了１８名演员。我常教演员们唱的曲目有《丁郎龙女》、《刘世瑶》、《夜郎》、《秦娘美》等。乡侗戏班先后到过贵阳、昆明、柳州等地演出，很受欢迎。
    记者：听说在侗族地区，老人最受尊敬，都说“家有老，是个宝”。年轻人把尊重、体贴和赡养老人视为天职，一般到了五六十岁的人，儿子媳妇就不让他们干农活了。
    杨广荣：是这样的。我有儿有女，他们都对我非常孝顺。自从老伴死后，我的责任田就由他们分种。儿媳妇们也很关心我，知道老人喜欢吃淡、软、温的食物，经常为我熬些油鸡汤、牛肉汤、排骨汤、绿豆汤等等，水果和其它“荤蔬”，也都要切碎、洗净、煨烂了给我吃。没有比她们再贴心的了。
    记者：这才是“老有所养、老有所乐、老有所为”啊。衷心祝愿你们晚年生活得更加幸福。
