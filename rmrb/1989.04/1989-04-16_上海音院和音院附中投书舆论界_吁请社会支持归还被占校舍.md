The following two letters reflect the issue of school buildings occupied during the Cultural Revolution that has yet to be resolved. We excerpt and publish them here, hoping to draw the attention of relevant departments to properly handle and resolve the issue.

The campus of Shanghai Conservatory of Music's Affiliated Middle School was seized by the current Shanghai Opera House during the Cultural Revolution. In 1979, the Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee presided over a multi-party meeting, which resulted in the "Minutes of the Meeting on the Adjustment of the East Ping Road No. 9 Building." The "Minutes" clearly stated that the Shanghai Opera House's "Shanghai Opera Troupe 1 and 3, using part of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music's Affiliated Middle School's buildings on East Ping Road No. 9, totaling approximately 3,600 square meters of building area, should be returned in full to the Shanghai Conservatory of Music's Affiliated Middle School." However, the Shanghai Opera House has designated plots of land and demanded huge sums of money, persistently making unreasonable demands and adopting tactics of hard resistance and soft obstruction, refusing to execute the "Minutes." They have moved in married couples and families in difficulty into the campus; they have converted the temporary housing, jointly applied for by us and the Shanghai Opera House to the relevant higher authorities for the Shanghai Opera House's relocation, into the "Shanghai Opera House Guest House" and "Nanli Restaurant," treating them as sources of revenue. The influx of residential households into the campus has made it impossible for the school to carry out teaching activities, ensure safety, and maintain order in a normal and orderly manner.

For more than a decade, our school's teachers and students have been crammed into one building for office work, classes, and student dormitories. More than 100 Shanghai students cannot live on campus, let alone practice their instruments. The entire school of more than 200 teachers and students can only have meals at four or five tables.

It has been an entire decade, and the Shanghai Opera House has not returned a single classroom to us! We earnestly appeal to all sectors of society to lend a helping hand and not let our children despair in the "Education Year"!

The sports field used by more than 1,000 faculty and staff of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music for physical activities has been occupied by the Armed Police Corps for more than a decade since the Cultural Revolution. The State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Shanghai Municipal Government have issued documents, clearly ordering all government agencies and troops to withdraw from the occupied school buildings; and explicitly stipulating that the nature of school sports fields must not be changed or used for other purposes. Central leaders, military commission leaders, and municipal committee leaders have repeatedly instructed that the "large sports field shared by the two parties before the Cultural Revolution and living in harmony" should be restored, but the Armed Police Corps has created various excuses to refuse to execute the order. The sports field has been used by them to pile up garbage and building materials, resembling a wasteland. For many years, our physical education classes have been forced to take place on the cement ground within the campus, resulting in frequent accidents such as falls, sprains, and collisions with pedestrians. The annual sports meet is also impossible to hold.

In July 1988, the Corps again defied the instructions of the central and municipal committee leaders, building more than 1,000 square meters of commercial buildings, vehicle team rooms, warehouses, etc. (the commercial buildings are planned to be rented out). When the municipal committee leaders intervened to stop them, they openly resisted, working day and night to accelerate the construction, once again arousing the indignation of our faculty and staff, who tore down the iron fence, and the relationship between the two parties became tense again. For this reason, the municipal committee leaders convened a meeting of the responsible persons from both parties, severely criticized the armed police side, and instructed the troops "not to move a brick or tile" and to immediately stop the construction to prevent the situation from escalating. Now, the Armed Police Corps still refuses to execute the municipal committee's instructions and continues to build on the sports field.

We appeal to the Armed Police Corps to seriously execute the spirit of the documents issued by the State Council, the Central Military Commission, the Shanghai Municipal Committee, and the Municipal Government—to immediately restore our large sports field from before the Cultural Revolution and live in harmony with us.

### 上海音院和音院附中投书舆论界　吁请社会支持归还被占校舍

　　上海音院和音院附中投书舆论界
　　吁请社会支持归还被占校舍
    编者按：下面两封来信，反映“文革”中被占校舍问题，迄今未获解决。我们摘要发表，希望引起有关部门关注，妥善处置，加以解决。
　　　　　　
    我们上海音乐学院附中的校舍在“文革”中被现在的上海京剧院强占，１９７９年，上海市委秘书长出面主持召开了多方会议，通过了“关于东平路九号房屋调整工作会议纪要”。“纪要”明确指出，上海京剧院“京剧一团、三团使用的东平路九号音乐学院附中部分校舍，共约３６００平方米建筑面积，应当全部归还音乐学院附中”。但上海京剧院，却指定地块，索要巨资，一味提出不合理的要求，采取硬拖软抗，拒不执行“纪要”。他们把结婚户、困难户塞进校园；把以我们和京剧院联名向上级有关部门申请建造的专为京剧院搬迁过渡用房改作“上海京剧院招待所”和“南伶酒家”，视为创收的财源。住家户大量涌入校园，使学校的教学秩序、安全、保卫等一系列工作无法正常有序进行。
    十多年来，我校师生办公、上课、学生的男女宿舍被挤缩在一幢楼内。１００多上海学生无法在校住宿，更不能在校练琴。全校２００多师生只能在四、五张条桌上用餐。
    整整十年了，上海京剧院未还我一间校舍！我们恳请社会各界伸出手来，千万不要让我们的孩子们在“教育年”里绝望啊！

    上海音乐学院１０００多名师生员工进行体育活动的大操场，在“文革”中被武警总队占用至今已有十几年了。国务院、中央军委、上海市府先后发出文件，明令一切政府机关、部队必须退出占用的学校校舍；并明确规定不得改变学校的运动场地的性质或移作他用。中央领导、军委领导、市委领导同志也多次就上音操场被占一事，再三指示要“恢复‘文革’前的大操场两家共用和睦相处”，但武警总队却制造种种借口拒不执行。运动场被他们用作堆放垃圾和建筑材料，犹如一片废墟。多年来，我院体育课被迫在校园内水泥地上勉强进行。致使学生们不断发生摔伤、扭伤、与行人相撞事故。一年一度的运动会更无法进行。
    １９８８年７月总队再次违背中央和市委领导指示，又在靠淮海路一边的大操场上兴建了１０００多平方米的商场房屋、车队用房、仓库等设施（其中商场拟作出租）。当市委领导出面劝阻时，他们公然抗拒，日夜加班施工，再一次激起了我院师生员工的义愤，推倒了铁丝网，双方关系又趋紧张。为此，市委领导召集双方负责人会议，严肃批评了武警方面并指示部队“不准再动一砖一瓦”，立即停止施工，防止事态扩大。现在武警总队仍拒不执行市委指示，继续在操场上大兴土木。
    对此，我们吁请武警部队严肃执行国务院、中央军委、上海市委、市府文件的精神——立即恢复我院“文革”前的大操场，两家和睦相处。
