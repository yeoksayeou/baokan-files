The U.S. opposes the admission of the State of Palestine as a member of the United Nations. The PLO demands that the UN condemn Israeli atrocities. Arafat opposes elections under occupation.

	NEW YORK, April 14 — The U.S. State Department today opposed the admission of the State of Palestine as a member of the United Nations.

	Despite the fact that 98 countries have already recognized the State of Palestine, the State Department said in a statement, "The State of Palestine does not meet the standards of international law regarding statehood, and therefore does not qualify for membership in UN organizations."

	The statement also expressed that the U.S. government opposes granting the PLO any privileges and rights beyond that of an observer in the United Nations.

	On the 13th, 38 U.S. senators wrote to Secretary of State Baker, threatening that if the United Nations recognizes the State of Palestine, they will "consider a series of punitive measures, including the withholding of funds from (UN) organizations."

	Meanwhile, the U.S. has notified its allies that the U.S. government is prepared to obstruct the PLO's efforts to gain international recognition for the State of Palestine.

	TUNIS, April 14 — The PLO issued a statement in Tunis today, demanding that the UN Security Council take immediate action to condemn Israel's massacre of Palestinians and take effective measures to protect the Palestinian people under Israeli rule.

	CAIRO, April 15 — Palestinian President Arafat said here today that he opposes holding elections in Palestinian territories under Israeli occupation.

	Arafat's view was endorsed by President Mubarak.

	Arafat arrived here tonight after a two-day visit to Iraq. He will consult with Mubarak on the peace process in the Middle East.

    新华社华盛顿４月１４日电　美国国务院今天反对接纳巴勒斯坦国为联合国成员国。
    尽管目前已有９８个国家相继承认了巴勒斯坦国，但美国国务院在一项声明中说，“巴勒斯坦国不符合国际法中关于国家的标准，所以没有资格在联合国机构中获得成员国的地位。”
    声明表示，美国政府反对给予巴解组织超越联合国观察员身份的权利和特权。
    １３日，３８名美国参议员致函国务卿贝克，威胁说，如果联合国承认巴勒斯坦国，他们将“考虑一系列惩罚措施，其中包括不向（联合国）机构交纳经费”。
    与此同时，美国已通知它的盟国，美国政府准备阻止巴解组织为争取国际社会承认巴勒斯坦国所作的努力。
    新华社突尼斯４月１４日电　巴解组织１４日在突尼斯发表的一项声明中，要求联合国安理会紧急行动起来，谴责以色列屠杀巴勒斯坦人的行径和采取有效措施来保护在以色列统治下的巴勒斯坦人民。
    新华社开罗４月１５日电　巴勒斯坦国总统阿拉法特今天在此指出，他反对在以色列占领下的巴勒斯坦领土上举行选举。
    阿拉法特的这一看法得到了穆巴拉克总统的赞同。
    阿拉法特是在结束对伊拉克的两天访问之后于今晚抵达这里的。他将同穆巴拉克就中东地区的和平进程问题进行磋商。
