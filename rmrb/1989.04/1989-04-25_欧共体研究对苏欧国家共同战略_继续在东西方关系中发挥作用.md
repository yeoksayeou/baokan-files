The European Community's 12 foreign ministers solemnly declared today that the Community and its member states will continue to respond constructively to the political and economic reforms underway in the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries, as well as to the satisfactory normalization of relations between the Soviet and Eastern European countries and the Community. They will continue to play an active role in East-West relations.

The 12 foreign ministers thoroughly studied the issue of formulating a "coordinated, consistent, and dynamic overall plan" for the Community and the 12 countries to develop relations with the Soviet and Eastern European countries. They unanimously agreed that the overall plan should include the Community's economic policies towards the Soviet and Eastern European countries, as well as political initiatives coordinated by the 12 countries within the framework of political cooperation. The presidency and the Community Commission should work together to make the two more consistent.

The ministers emphasized that the cooperation being established between the Community and the Soviet and Eastern European countries, and the cooperation between the Community member states and the Soviet and Eastern European countries, "should not replace each other, but should complement and promote each other." The Council of the European Communities called on member states to ensure that their export credit policies to Eastern Europe are "transparent" and "coordinated."

The Council also believes that it is necessary to strengthen the Community's "active presence" in Eastern European countries, especially in promoting the entry of Western European economic circles into the Eastern European market within the framework of trade and cooperation agreements signed with Eastern European countries. The Council decided to "improve internal procedures" to better handle various matters related to agreements already signed and to be signed with Eastern European countries.

The idea of formulating a joint strategy for the Community's development of relations with the Soviet and Eastern European countries was first proposed by Belgian Foreign Minister Tindemans and Community Commission President Delors. The starting point is to support the continued development of Soviet and Eastern European reforms in a direction favorable to Western Europe in the process of normalizing East-West relations, while preventing some Western European countries from rushing in and deviating from the "open yet vigilant" policy. It is believed that today's communiqué from the Council is a new step towards formulating a "joint strategy."

　　欧共体研究对苏欧国家共同战略    
    继续在东西方关系中发挥作用
    新华社卢森堡４月２４日电（记者诸葛仓麟）欧洲共同体１２国外交部长今天郑重声明，共同体及其成员国对苏联和东欧一些国家进行的政治、经济改革以及苏欧国家和共同体令人满意的关系正常化进程“将继续作出建设性的反应并继续在东西方关系中发挥积极作用”。
    １２国外长全面研究了为共同体和１２国发展对苏欧关系制定一项“协调一致的和有生命力的总体方案”问题，一致认为，总体方案应当包括共同体制定的对苏欧国家经济政策，以及１２国在政治合作范围内协商的政治倡议。主席国和共同体委员会应该配合，促进两者更趋一致。
    外长们强调，共同体与苏欧国家正在建立的合作和共同体成员国与苏欧国家的合作，“不应互相取代，而应相辅相成，相互推动”。欧共体理事会呼吁各成员国对东欧的出口信贷政策必须“透明”和“协调一致”。
    理事会还认为，应该加强共同体在东欧国家的“积极存在”，特别是在与东欧国家签订的贸易和合作协议范畴内推动西欧经济界进入东欧市场。理事会决定“改善内部程序”，以便更有效地做好与东欧已经签订和即将签订的协议有关的各项工作。
    制定共同体发展对苏欧关系共同战略的设想是比利时外交大臣廷德曼斯和共同体委员会主席德洛尔率先提出的，其出发点是在东西欧关系正常化进程中，既支持苏欧改革继续朝有利于西欧方向发展，又防止西欧一些国家一哄而上，背离“既开放、又警觉”的方针。据认为，理事会今天的公报是朝制定“共同战略”取得的新进展。
