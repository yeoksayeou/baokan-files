The Temple of Genghis Khan, located at the summit of Han Mountain in Ulanhot City, Inner Mongolia, is now welcoming visitors from home and abroad with a fresh and new appearance.

The temple was built with funds donated by the Mongolian people in the spring of 1940 and completed in the summer of 1944. The entire temple complex covers an area of 68,000 square meters and is designed in the shape of a "mountain." It is a blend of Mongolian and Tibetan architectural styles, showcasing strong ethnic characteristics.

Due to human damage and poor management, the temple's surrounding walls and the eastern hall collapsed, and the main hall was in a state of disrepair. Since 1983, the local government has undertaken a comprehensive renovation of the Temple of Genghis Khan. The renovated temple features 81 granite steps and a new bronze statue that is lifelike.

　　成吉思汗庙修葺一新
    新华社呼和浩特四月七日电  （记者石圭平）位于内蒙古乌兰浩特市罕山之巅的成吉思汗庙，目前正以崭新面貌接待中外游人。
    这座庙一九四零年春季由蒙古族人民自发捐款兴建，一九四四年夏季完工。整个庙宇占地六万八千平方米，外观呈“山”字形，是蒙藏合璧式的建筑，具有浓郁的民族特色。
    由于人为的破坏和管理不善，成吉思汗庙的围墙及东侧殿倒塌，大殿内破烂不堪。从一九八三年开始，当地政府对成吉思汗庙进行全面整修。修葺一新的成吉思汗庙增设了八十一个花岗岩石阶，新铜座像栩栩如生。
