Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 17th - (Reporter Tang Deqiao) After the Polish Solidarity Union was approved for re-registration by the Warsaw Provincial Court, its chairman Lech Walesa said in an interview with Polish reporters today that it is difficult to predict what the Solidarity Union will become in the future, but one thing is certain: "In the past, we acted emotionally and often resorted to strikes, which is a lesson we must remember."

Walesa made these remarks after the Solidarity Union was re-registered. He said that over the past 10 years, Solidarity Union activists have learned not to act emotionally but to work hard for the future development of Poland.

Walesa also issued a statement today, expressing support for the "real and profound economic reforms" being carried out by the Polish authorities and the democratization process in Poland. Walesa announced that before the upcoming national congress, the Solidarity Union will not implement the provisions in its charter regarding strikes, in order to maintain social stability and national reconciliation.

The spokesperson for the National Coordination Council of Polish Trade Unions, Czemne, welcomed the legalization of the Solidarity Union. He said that in the future, there will still be "disagreements" between the Trade Union Council and the Solidarity Union. However, he expressed his belief that for the common goals and the interests of the country, the two union organizations can "completely eliminate differences and reach an understanding."

　　团结工会获准登记注册后
　　瓦文萨说将牢记感情用事的教训
    新华社华沙４月１７日电　（记者汤德乔）波兰团结工会主席瓦文萨今天在接受波兰记者采访时指出，很难预料团结工会今后究竟会变成什么样子，但有一点是肯定的，那就是“过去我们感情用事，动辄罢工，这是一个必须牢记的教训”。
    瓦文萨是在华沙省法院批准团结工会重新登记后说这番话的。他说，１０年来，团结工会活动家们懂得不应感情用事，而应拿出工作干劲来，为波兰今后的发展服务。
    瓦文萨今天还发表了一项声明，表示支持波兰当局推行的“真正的、深刻的经济改革”和波兰国家的民主化进程。瓦文萨宣布，团结工会在即将召开的全国代表会议前不执行自己章程中有关罢工的条款，以利于社会安定和全民和解。
    波兰工会全国协议会新闻发言人切姆内对团结工会合法化表示欢迎。他说，今后工会协议会和团结工会之间仍“将会出现意见分歧”。但是，他表示相信，为了共同的目标和祖国的利益两个工会组织是“完全可以消除分歧，达成谅解的”。
