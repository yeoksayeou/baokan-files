The Central Political Bureau held its 17th plenary session in Beijing today to discuss the "Draft Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Several Issues Regarding the Development and Reform of Education."

The drafting and formation of this "Draft Decision" took about a year. Last April, the 7th and 8th sessions of the Central Political Bureau discussed education issues and decided to form a special group under the State Council to investigate and research major issues in the development and reform of education and to make recommendations. The "Draft Decision" was formed based on extensive investigations, research, and the collection of opinions from various sectors. The Central Political Bureau and the State Council held multiple meetings to listen to reports on the research and drafting of the document, carefully studied the opinions and suggestions of National People's Congress deputies, members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, democratic parties, social organizations, and people from all walks of life regarding education issues, and discussed the important role of education in modernization construction, as well as issues related to education funding, teacher remuneration, moral education, education development strategy, education legislation, and education reform. Specific measures for the development and reform of education were proposed.

The meeting decided to further solicit opinions on this "Draft Decision" within a broader scope both inside and outside the Party and to convene the 4th Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee at an appropriate time for deliberation.

Attending the meeting were 15 members of the Central Political Bureau, 1 alternate member of the Central Political Bureau, and 2 members of the Central Political Bureau who were absent for official reasons.

General Secretary Zhao Ziyang presided over the meeting, and relevant responsible persons attended the meeting.
