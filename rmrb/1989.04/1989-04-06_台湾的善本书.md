Taiwan is home to numerous rare editions and fine books of ancient Chinese literature.

These invaluable treasures of the literary world are primarily housed in the National Central Library, the National Palace Museum Library, and the Institute of History and Philology Library at the Academia Sinica in Taiwan.

In 1949, a significant number of rare books were airlifted from Chongqing and other locations to Taiwan. These include Song Dynasty editions, Jin Dynasty editions, Yuan Dynasty editions, Ming Dynasty editions, early Qing Dynasty editions, as well as manuscripts and handwritten copies from various dynasties. For example, the "Siku Quanshu," originally stored in the Wen Yuan Ge, was completed in the 46th year of the Qianlong reign and consists of 3,460 titles and 79,339 volumes. Another example is the "Gu Jin Tu Shu Ji Cheng," which exists in three sets, each containing 5,000 volumes. All these rare books have been ordered by the Taiwanese authorities to be photographed and stored as microfilm. According to "World Books," a total of 13,000 volumes and 6 million images have been captured.

The Taiwanese authorities have repeatedly negotiated with the United States and Japan to retrieve rare books and ancient texts originally stored in the former Beijing Library during the war and some personal collections stored in Japan during the liberation war. These rare books have further enriched the collections of various libraries in Taiwan.

Over the past thirty years, scholars and prominent figures in Taiwan have repeatedly called for a shift in the focus of library collections towards overseas holdings. In 1981, the "Hanxue Resource Center" was established under the National Central Library, with a long-term plan to gradually collect and reproduce Chinese rare books and ancient texts held in Japan, Europe, and America. The center has already commissioned a Japanese company to reproduce a batch of Ming Dynasty editions, including Ming Dynasty literary collections and local chronicles. Of course, this requires a significant amount of commissioning fees.

To facilitate borrowing, various libraries in Taiwan have compiled catalogs of rare books. The catalogs come in two types: one for Song and Yuan Dynasty editions and another for general rare books. The catalogs vary in detail, with some providing detailed annotations and others simply listing the book titles, publication dates, and authors.

　　台湾的善本书
　　冼夫
    台湾珍藏着不少古籍的珍本、善本书。
    这些价值连城的书林之奇，主要收藏在台湾中央图书馆，台湾故宫博物院图书馆和台湾中研院历史语言研究所图书馆。
    １９４９年，被陆续从重庆等地空运到台湾的善本书，计有宋刊本、金刊本、元刊本、明刊本、清初刊本和历代稿本、抄本。比如《四库全书》，原藏于文渊阁，修成于乾隆四十六年，计３４６０种，７９３３９卷；再譬如《古今图书集成》，计有３套，每套５０００册。所有的善本书，台湾当局已责令各图书馆拍摄成缩微胶卷。据《世界图书》透露，共拍１．３万卷，６００多万张。
    台湾当局曾多次与美国、日本交涉，索回了原北平图书馆在抗战期间存放在美国国会图书馆的善本古籍和一些个人在解放战争期间存在日本民间的图书。这些善本书更加充实了台湾各图书馆古籍的库藏量。
    三十多年来，台湾各界名流、学者相继要求将图书馆收藏的注意力转向海外，１９８１年成立了附属于台湾中央图书馆的“汉学资料”中心，拟定了长期计划，准备分期分阶段地搜集和影印日、欧、美所藏的中国善本古籍。该中心已经委托日本某公司复印一批日本收藏的明刊古籍，内有明人文集，方志等等。当然，这需要一笔数目不少的委托费。
    为了方便借阅，台湾各图书馆都编制了善本古书目录。目录分两种，一为宋元本图录，一为一般善本古书目录，或简或详，体例不一，详者提要目录，简者仅记书名、成书年代、著者。
