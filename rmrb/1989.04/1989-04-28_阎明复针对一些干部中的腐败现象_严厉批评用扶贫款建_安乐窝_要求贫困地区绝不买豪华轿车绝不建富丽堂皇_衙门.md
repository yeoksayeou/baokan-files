	Yan Mingfu, a member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the head of the United Front Work Department, today severely criticized some leading cadres in impoverished areas for using state funds allocated for poverty alleviation and disaster relief to build "comfortable homes."

	At the morning session of the planning and development conference for the Bijiang Region of Guizhou Province's poverty alleviation and ecological construction experimental area, Yan Mingfu said, "Leading cadres at all levels in impoverished areas must dare to make a solemn pledge: not to build 'comfortable homes'; not to buy a single luxury car, not to build a single grand 'office,' and not to build private houses for themselves. They must wholeheartedly devote themselves to the cause of poverty alleviation and prosperity."

	He said, "We must clearly recognize that achieving poverty alleviation and prosperity in impoverished areas is not just about solving the immediate food and clothing needs of the local people. It is also about achieving comprehensive development in politics, economy, and culture, and better promoting national unity."

	It is understood that the "Bijiang Poverty Alleviation and Ecological Construction Experimental Zone" was established with the approval of the State Council last year. Since its establishment, the central committees of various democratic parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce have done a great deal of work to help Bijiang formulate development plans and carry out intellectual support for border areas. This conference will further deliberate on this development plan.

　　阎明复针对一些干部中的腐败现象    
    严厉批评用扶贫款建“安乐窝”    
    要求贫困地区绝不买豪华轿车绝不建富丽堂皇“衙门”
    新华社北京４月２８日电  中共中央书记处书记、统战部部长阎明复今天严厉批评了一些贫困地区的领导干部把国家用于脱贫致富、救济灾民的资金修建“安乐窝”的腐败现象。
    在今天上午召开的贵州省毕节地区开发扶贫、生态建设试验发展规划论证会上，阎明复说，贫困地区的各级领导干部要敢于立下军令状，不建“安乐窝”：绝不买一辆豪华轿车，绝不建一座富丽堂皇的“衙门”，绝不为自己盖私房，一心一意地投入到脱贫致富的事业中去。
    他说，应该清醒地认识到，实现贫困地区脱贫致富不仅是为解决当地群众的温饱问题，而且是要实现这些地区政治、经济、文化事业的综合发展，更好地促进民族团结。
    据悉，“毕节开发扶贫、生态建设试验区”，是经国务院批准于去年建立的。试验区建立以来，各民主党派中央、全国工商联分别为帮助毕节制定发展规划，开展智力支边活动，做了大量工作。这次会议将就这个发展规划作进一步论证。
