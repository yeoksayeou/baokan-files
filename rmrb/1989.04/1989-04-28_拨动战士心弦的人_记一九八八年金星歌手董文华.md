She was the first singer to popularize the song "The Fifteenth Moon" across the nation. What made her so emotional, singing to the point where border soldiers shed tears in their military uniforms, and military wives dream of their love?

The enchanting age of 15, while others were weaving dreams of roses, Dong Wenhua joined the Shenyang Military Region's Forward Song and Dance Troupe as a female soldier. Soon, she performed on the Sino-Soviet border. There was a certain outpost with five soldiers who had not come down from the mountain in three years. The political instructor's wife and child were seriously ill, and it took two months before they received a letter. At the celebration meeting, the political instructor wept: "Half of the honor belongs to my wife." Dong Wenhua listened and tears welled up in her eyes.

One day, she unexpectedly discovered "The Fifteenth Moon" at composer Tie Yuan's home, which resonated deeply within her. Every time she practiced singing it, she was overcome with emotion. Dong Wenhua went to the front lines of Laoshan to perform this song for the soldiers in the cat ears cave, and soft sobs could be heard from the microphone. Dong Wenhua, with tears in her eyes, shouted into the microphone, "Heroic soldiers, I love you!" The microphone replied, "Dong Wenhua, we love you..."

Whether it was the influence of her humble working-class upbringing or the fact that she had type A blood, Dong Wenhua was so dedicated to singing. "Song is my love, my pursuit, I have an inseparable bond with song..." she said. As a child, while other children played, she sat mesmerized by her first teacher—the radio. When she heard that singing into a water jar was good for training the voice, she stuck her head, with its two braids, into the jar to practice. In the Shenyang Military Region's Forward Opera Troupe, she had played roles such as a blind girl, a tomboy, a wayward youth, and a little girl in several operas, and had also been a solo performer, developing a singing style that was intimate, natural, and sweet. Later, she fell in love with popular songs, and with "The Fifteenth Moon" and "Blood-Stained Splendor," her fame spread across the nation. At the end of last year, enthusiastic audiences voted nearly 200,000 times to elect her as the 1988 Golden Star of the music world. Composer Chen Geng commented: Dong Wenhua "used Western traditional bel canto training to develop her voice, cultivating and refining her vocal quality and timbre... blending the advantages of Chinese folk singing, such as articulation, pronunciation, phrasing, onset, and cadence, into her singing..."

It is life that has given Dong Wenhua such rich artistic inspiration. She loves soldiers, and their pure and sincere emotions nurture her. She loves her husband, and their deep affection for each other, along with their mutual pursuit of excellence, makes her experience the bittersweet longing. She misses her parents, but mostly sees them in her dreams; she longs to be a mother, but for the sake of her career, she has to postpone it again and again...

Awards, flowers, applause, and praise have never made Dong Wenhua lose her composure. She knows that whether it is her singing career or her life path, both are long journeys. How can she continue to sing with her own unique style and always captivate the audience with her distinctive beauty? She is very clear-headed and understands what her success depends on. Currently, she is studying in the vocal department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Academy of Arts and will soon graduate. She seriously told the author: I am a fish that cannot live without the ocean. This ocean is the soldiers, the lyricists and composers, and the millions of listeners. Without them, I cannot survive for a single day.

　　拨动战士心弦的人    
    ——记一九八八年金星歌手董文华
    初小玲
    她是第一个把《十五的月亮》唱遍全国的歌手。是什么使她那样动情，唱得边陲将士泪洒戎装，军人妻子梦牵情绕？
    令人迷恋的１５岁，别人还在编织玫瑰梦，董文华却到沈阳军区前进歌舞团当了一名女兵。不久，她到中苏边境演出。那里某哨位有五个战士，当兵三年没下过山。指导员的夫人与孩子生重病，两个月以后才接到信。庆功会上，指导员泪流满面：“荣誉一半应属于我的妻子。”董文华听了，眼泪夺眶而出。
    有一天，她在作曲家铁源家中意外地发现《十五的月亮》，心中引起强烈的共鸣。每次练唱，她都激动不巳。董文华来到老山前线给猫耳洞的战士演唱这支歌，话筒里传来轻轻抽泣声。董文华满含泪水对着话筒喊：“英雄的战士，我爱你们！”话筒里回答：“董文华，我们爱你……”
    是纯朴的工人家庭的熏陶，还是血管里流的是Ａ型血的缘故，董文华对唱歌是如此专一。“歌是我的爱，我的追求，我与歌有不解之缘……”她这样说。小时候，别的小朋友都去玩儿，她却如痴如醉地坐在启蒙老师——收音机旁。听别人说水缸练声好，她就把扎着羊角辫的小脑袋钻到水缸里去练。在沈阳军区前进歌剧团，她曾先后在几部歌剧中扮演瞎姑娘、假小子、失足青年、小姑娘等角色，也担任过独唱演员，形成了亲切、自然、甜润的演唱特点。以后她又爱上了流行歌曲，以《十五的月亮》、《血染的风采》声传全国。去年底，热情的观众以近２０万张的选票推举她为１９８８年歌坛金星。作曲家晨耕评论说：董文华“运用西洋传统的美声唱法训练了自己的发声，培植并修饰了自己的音质、音色……把中国民间唱法的吐词、咬字、行腔、起声、归韵等优点融汇在自己的歌声里……”。
    是生活赋予董文华如此丰富的艺术灵感。她爱战士，战士纯朴真挚的感情熏陶着她。她爱丈夫，两人彼此情深意笃，各自的锐意求索，又使她饱尝那牵肠挂肚的思念。她想念父母，却大多是梦中相见；她祈望做母亲，为了事业，又不得不一再推迟……
    奖章、鲜花、掌声、赞扬，从没使董文华忘乎所以。她深知今后无论是演唱生涯还是生活道路都是漫长的。如何继续唱出自己的个性，始终坚持以自己独特的美去征服观众？她十分清醒，明白自己成功的背后依赖着什么。眼下，她正在中国人民解放军艺术学院声乐系大专班进修，即将毕业。她认真地告诉笔者：我是一条离不开大海的鱼，这大海就是战士，就是歌的词曲作家，就是千千万万的听众，离开他们，我一天也生存不下去。
