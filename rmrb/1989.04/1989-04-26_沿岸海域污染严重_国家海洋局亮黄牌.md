The People's Daily reported from Beijing on April 26: Reporter Wang Xiyuan reports that the State Oceanic Administration has issued the latest bulletin on the marine environment: Monitoring over the past few years has shown that 90% of China's coastal large and medium-sized cities and their adjacent seas, bays, and estuaries are becoming increasingly polluted. This not only causes huge losses to the fishery industry but also seriously threatens human health.

The bulletin states that more than 80% of the pollutants in China's coastal waters come from land. Statistics show that China discharges nearly 7 billion tons of industrial and domestic wastewater into the ocean each year, more than 100,000 tons of pesticides, and over 400 million tons of fertilizers. In addition, a large amount of industrial waste and debris has exceeded the ocean's self-purification capacity.

The bitter fruits of human actions must be borne by humans themselves. Dalian Bay was once a breeding ground for marine delicacies. In recent years, due to frequent pollution incidents, the bay's tidal flats have become barren, and economic fish and shellfish have almost disappeared. What is even more worrying is that due to the influence of high-concentration pollutants, the residue of toxins in some aquatic products has increased, becoming a "time bomb" that threatens human health.

　　沿岸海域污染严重  国家海洋局亮黄牌
    本报北京４月２６日讯  记者王溪元报道：国家海洋局对海洋环境状况发出最新通报：近几年的监测表明，我国沿海９０％的大中城市及其毗邻海域、港湾、河口污染越来越严重，不仅使水产业遭受巨大损失，而且严重威胁人类自身的健康。
    通报说，我国沿岸海域８０％以上的污染物来自陆地。据统计，我国每年排入海洋的工业和生活污水近７０亿吨，农药１０多万吨，化肥４００多万吨，再加上大量的工业废渣、废料，已超出了海洋的自净能力。
    人类自酿的苦果，还得由人类自己来吞咽。大连湾曾是海珍品养殖基地，近年来由于污染事故频繁发生，已使湾内滩涂荒芜，经济鱼贝类几乎绝迹。尤其令人担忧的是，由于受高浓度污染物的影响，一些水产品体内毒物残留量增加，成为威胁人类健康的“定时炸弹”。
