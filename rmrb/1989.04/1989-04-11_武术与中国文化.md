	Martial Arts and Chinese Culture
	Jùn jì

	The culture of the human body is the mother of all human cultures. Each nation has its unique human body culture, and it is under the influence of their respective human body cultures that unique national cultures are formed. Take, for example, the unique human body culture of the Chinese nation, martial arts. Martial arts have influenced ancient Chinese performing arts such as acrobatics, dance, and wrestling performances, and have also become an important means of expression and performance content in classical arts such as opera. The influence of martial arts on literature is even more apparent. It is because of the numerous and long-history martial arts that there is the genre of chivalric literature, from ancient works like "Water Margin," "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," and "Journey to the West," to modern wuxia novels that emerged after the war.

	For a long time, I have felt that Chinese martial arts, as a unique human body culture, have had the deepest impact on the Chinese nation through the spirit of chivalry and the brave and generous national character, as well as the common appreciation for this spirit and character that has formed among the people, and the important branch of popular literature that has emerged to cater to this appreciation—wuxia novels.

	The influence and nurturing of martial arts on popular literature, especially wuxia novels, are evident. Now, the academic community—both the martial arts and literary circles—have begun to accept and value the subject of martial arts culture.

	Chinese martial arts have developed into their current form, which emphasizes both technique and philosophy, internal and external training, and has numerous schools and rich cultural connotations, becoming a spiritual treasure cherished by all humanity. This is due to their methods and theories of combat. From their inception, these theories have been nurtured and regulated by the ancient and unique system of traditional Chinese culture. In the long history of the development of martial arts, Chinese classical philosophy, traditional religion, literature, and art, as well as folklore, have all had a profound influence on martial arts; and martial arts themselves have become an important part of traditional Chinese culture and folklore.

	In December 1987, two international academic conferences related to Chinese martial arts were held in Kolkata, India, and the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The former was organized by the "International Theatre Institute" of UNESCO, titled the "Asian Theatre, Dance, and Martial Arts Festival," and the latter was the International Academic Conference on Chinese Wuxia Novels. The first conference was attended by experts, scholars, directors, and performers from the fields of theatre, dance, and martial arts from 26 countries and regions, including China, the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Hong Kong. Theatre and dance professionals from around the world deeply felt the profound influence of Chinese martial arts on unique Eastern performing arts. The main theme of the conference was centered around "Martial Arts and Related Performing Arts," covering topics such as the social and historical examination of martial arts, the relationship between martial arts and religious rituals, traditional training systems, the practice and structure of martial arts techniques, the rules of martial arts development in traditional performances, the preservation, inheritance, and application of martial arts in new play creation, the massage therapy system related to martial arts, and the representation of animal images in martial arts, among others. Experts of various races, with their different skin colors and eye colors, discussed martial arts and performing arts based on their knowledge and experiences. The value of Chinese civilization and the unique human body culture of the East, martial arts, was finally recognized by the world, leading to the convening of such an important conference. It is regrettable that, due to various reasons, we were unable to send a corresponding delegation to such an important opportunity and platform for promoting Chinese civilization. Only one dance director and two martial arts performers, who were temporarily invited, formed a small artistic group to attend the conference.

	Even so, they were warmly welcomed.

　　武术与中国文化
　　峻骥
    人体文化是人类一切文化之母，每个民族都有自己独特的人体文化，正是在各自的人体文化的影响下，才形成了各自民族特有的文化。即以中华民族独特的人体文化武术为例。武术既影响了中国古代的表演艺术：杂技、舞蹈、角抵百戏，又成为古典艺术明珠——戏曲重要的表现手段和表演内容。武术对文学的影响更为明显，正是有了门派繁多、历史悠久的武术，才有了剑侠文艺，远的如《水浒》、《三国演义》、《西游记》，近者如战后兴起的现代武侠小说。
    长期以来，我感到中华武学作为一种独特的人体文化，对中华民族最深刻的影响是侠者精神和勇义豪放的民族气质，以及由对这种精神和气质的追求向往而形成的全民共通的欣赏情趣，和适应这种情趣产生的俗文学的重要一支——武侠小说。
    武术对俗文学，特别是武侠小说的影响和哺乳是明显的。现在，学术界——武坛和文坛已开始接受和重视武术文化学这个课题了。
    中国武术所以能够形成今天这样技、道并重，内外兼修，流派繁多，绚丽多姿，包蕴丰厚民族文化内涵的独特风貌，成为全人类同珍共喜的精神财富，却是由于它的技击的方法和理论。这种理论，从产生之日起，就在古老而独成体系的中国传统文化的哺乳和规范之下。在武术发展的漫长历史进程中，中国古典哲学、传统宗教和文学艺术、民俗都给了武术深刻的影响；而武术自身也成为中国传统文化和民俗的重要内容。
    １９８７年１２月，在印度加尔各答和香港中文大学，分别召开了两个与中华武术大有关系的国际性学术会议。前者是由联合国教科文组织“舞蹈、戏剧国际协会”主办的“亚洲戏剧、舞蹈、武术艺术节”，后者是中国武侠小说国际学术会议。参加第一个会议的有中国、苏联、美国、英国、日本、香港等２６个国家、地区的戏剧、舞蹈、武术等方面的专家学者、编导和演员。全世界的戏剧家舞蹈家都深感中国武术对独特的东方表演艺术深刻的影响。大会的总题目就是围绕着“武术和有关表演艺术”而展开的，其中涉及到有关武术社会历史的考察，武术与宗教仪式及其前后的关系，基本训练的传统和体系，武打系列技巧的练习与结构，武术在传统演出中发展的规则，从武术到表演艺术，武术在新戏创作中的保存、继承和应用，有关武术的按摩医疗体系，有关武术中塑造动物形象的表现等十几个专题。那些肤分五色、碧眼黑睛的各种族的专家，以他们所能接触的知识感受，纵谈武术与表演艺术。中华文明，东方独特的人体文化武术的价值，终于为世人感知，乃召开如此重大会议讨论。令人遗憾的是，这样一个重要的弘扬中华文明的机会和讲坛，我们却由于种种原因未能派出一个相应的代表团，只有一位舞蹈编导和临时请来的两位武戏演员组成一个艺术小组出席了会议。
    即便如此，他们也受到了热烈欢迎。
