Xinhua News Agency, Paris, April 20th.

The 53rd Franco-German summit was held in Paris on the 19th and 20th. French President François Mitterrand and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl emphasized at the conclusion of the meeting on the 20th that the two countries should strengthen their coordination on European defense cooperation and disarmament issues.

Mitterrand said at a joint press conference with Kohl that both sides not only expressed the desire to strengthen military cooperation but also resolved to help formulate a "common European stance on defense security." He said, "The outstanding ideas that have led to the hope of ending the arms race and easing East-West relations in Europe over the past two or three years will be expanded through Franco-German cooperation."

He also pointed out that the efforts of NATO and the Warsaw Pact in disarmament "should be complementary," therefore, NATO's decisions on the modernization of short-range nuclear weapons should not harm the process of détente.

The two leaders also focused their discussions on the tense situation in Lebanon. Mitterrand stated that France would continue its humanitarian efforts and hoped that the United Nations Secretary-General could mediate to stop the fighting in Lebanon. Kohl, on the other hand, expressed that the West German government was ready to support France's actions at any time.

　　法国西德首脑会议强调    
    协调防务与裁军政策
    新华社巴黎４月２０日电  第５３次法德首脑会议１９日和２０日在巴黎举行。法国总统密特朗和联邦德国总理科尔２０日在会议结束时强调，两国在欧洲防务合作和裁军问题上要加强协调立场。
    密特朗在同科尔联合举行的记者招待会上说，双方不仅表达了加强军事合作的愿望，而且决心帮助制订出“欧洲在防务安全上的共同立场”。他说，“导致最近两三年在欧洲出现结束军备竞赛和东西方关系缓和希望的卓越思想”将通过法德合作而扩大。
    他还指出，北约和华约在裁军方面的努力“应该是相辅相成的”，因此，北约关于短程核武器现代化方面做出的决定不应有损于缓和的进程。
    两位领导人在会谈中还着重讨论了黎巴嫩紧张局势。密特朗表示法国将继续其人道主义行动，并希望联合国秘书长能够为制止黎巴嫩的战火而进行调解。科尔则表示，西德政府随时准备支持法国的行动。
