Vietnamese Armed Vessels Shoot and Kill Chinese Fishermen
China's Foreign Ministry Strongly Protests Vietnamese Atrocities

The Chinese Foreign Ministry today lodged a protest with the Vietnamese Embassy in China over the shooting of Chinese fishermen by Vietnamese armed vessels on March 26, expressing strong indignation and protest against the Vietnamese actions.

On March 25, a fishing vessel from Anlang Village, Beidong Town, Suixi County, Guangdong Province, with the registration number 21155, was operating in the public waters of the Beibu Gulf. Due to encountering a strong wind, the vessel was forced to anchor near the Vietnamese island of Trinh Long to avoid the storm. On the morning of March 26, as the vessel was preparing to leave Vietnamese waters, it was surrounded and fired upon by three Vietnamese armed vessels. The captain, Chen Tu'an, was killed on the spot, and crew member Li Huachang was seriously injured and died after returning to Beihai.

Deputy Director Zhang Qing of the Asian Affairs Department of the Foreign Ministry summoned the Vietnamese Embassy's Counselor to discuss the matter. He stated that when fishing vessels from various countries encounter unavoidable natural disasters at sea, they typically seek refuge in the nearest foreign ports. In recent years, many Vietnamese fishing vessels operating in the Beibu Gulf have also sought refuge in Chinese ports to avoid storms and have received good treatment from China.

He said that the aforementioned actions by the Vietnamese side seriously violate international customs and infringe upon the legitimate rights of Chinese fishermen. The Chinese side expresses strong indignation and protests against the Vietnamese atrocities. The Vietnamese authorities repeatedly claim to want to improve Sino-Vietnamese relations, but in reality, their words and deeds do not match. We demand that the Vietnamese side take concrete steps to prevent similar incidents from happening again. The Chinese side reserves the right to demand compensation from the Vietnamese side for the families of the Chinese fishermen who were harmed.

　　越南武装船只开枪打死中国渔民
    我外交部强烈抗议越方暴行
    新华社北京４月４日电  中国外交部今天就３月２６日越南武装船只开枪打死中国渔民一事，同越南驻华使馆进行了交涉，对越方的暴行表示极大愤慨和强烈抗议。
    今年３月２５日，中国广东省遂溪县北氹镇安塘村２１１５５号渔船在北部湾公海作业时，因遇大风，被迫到越南青蓝岛附近抛锚避风。２６日上午８时许，该渔船在起锚离开越水域时，遭到三艘越南武装船只围追和扫射，船长陈土安当场被打死，船员李华昌被打成重伤，回到北海后死亡。
    外交部亚洲司张青副司长就此事约见越驻华使馆参赞时说，各国渔船在公海上作业时因不可抗拒的自然原因，到就近别国港口避险是国际上的通常做法。近年来不少在北部湾作业的越南渔船也曾先后到中国港口避风，得到中方的良好照料。
    他说，越方上述行径严重违反国际惯例，侵害了中国渔民的正当权益，中国方面对越方的暴行表示极大愤慨和强烈抗议。越南当局口口声声表示希望改善中越关系，而实际上言行不一，我们要求越方采取切实步骤，防止类似事件再度发生。中方保留要求越方向中国遇害渔民家属提供赔偿的权利。
