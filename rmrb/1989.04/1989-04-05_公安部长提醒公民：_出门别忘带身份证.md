The public security minister reminds citizens: don't forget to carry your ID card when going out.

New China News Agency, Beijing, April 4th - Before National Day, the country will implement the system of using and checking resident ID cards in urban and rural areas. Today, State Councilor and Minister of Public Security Wang Fang reminded every citizen: don't forget to carry your resident ID card when going out.

Wang Fang said at the national resident ID card work conference today that in social activities, economic activities, and judicial activities, whenever a citizen presents their resident ID card, all relevant departments should consider it as the primary and legally effective document for proving personal identity.

Wang Fang pointed out that implementing the resident ID card system is a major reform in state administration. The resident ID card is a document that citizens personally hold and can use to prove their identity at any time. It greatly facilitates the public and meets the needs of modern life. On the other hand, it is an important tool for public security organs to implement dynamic management of social order, especially in the management and control of the floating population.

Wang Fang hopes that all levels of government will use various propaganda channels to widely and deeply publicize the significance and role of implementing the resident ID card system, enhancing the public's understanding and awareness of carrying, using resident ID cards, and voluntarily accepting inspections.

　　公安部长提醒公民：
    出门别忘带身份证
    新华社北京４月４日电  （记者周立宪）国庆节前，我国城乡将实施使用、查验居民身份证制度。国务委员兼公安部长王芳今天提醒每个公民：出门别忘携带居民身份证。
    王芳今天在全国居民身份证工作会议上说，在社会活动、经济活动以及司法活动中，凡是公民出示了自己的居民身份证，各主管部门都应视之为公民证明个人身份的首要的、具有法律效力的证件。
    王芳指出，实行居民身份证制度是国家行政管理的一项重大改革。居民身份证是我国公民个人持有的、随时可以证明身份的证件。它的使用极大地方便了群众，适应了人们现代生活的需要。另一方面，它又是公安机关实行社会治安动态管理的一个重要手段，特别是在对流动人口的管理和控制方面十分有效。
    王芳希望各级政府通过各种宣传渠道，广泛深入地宣传实行居民身份证制度的意义和作用，增强群众对携带、使用居民身份证和自觉接受查验的理解和认识。
