	XINHUA, Xi'an, April 12 — Reporter Jing Xianfeng reports: The Cailong Electronics Group, with the Shaanxi Color Picture Tube Factory as its core and comprising 14 member units, was officially established today.

	The first phase of the Shaanxi Color Picture Tube Factory, with a total investment of 750 million yuan, began construction in April 1979 and started production in December 1982. This marked the end of China's inability to produce color picture tubes domestically. The original design capacity was 960,000 tubes per year.

	The factory's annual production capacity has now reached 1.28 million tubes. By April of last year, it had recovered the entire investment of 750 million yuan for the first phase. The second phase expansion project, with a total investment of 750 million yuan, will form a comprehensive production capacity of 1.6 million tubes per year. It is expected to be completed and put into operation by October of next year.

    陕西扩建彩管生产基地
    本报西安4月12日电  记者景险峰报道：以陕西彩色显像管总厂为主体、由14个成员单位组成的彩虹电子集团公司今天正式成立。
    总投资为7.5亿元的陕西彩色显像管总厂一期工程，1979年4月破土动工，1982年12月正式投产，从此结束了我国自己不能生产彩色显像管的历史，原设计能力为年产彩管96万支。
    这家工厂年产能力已达到128万支，截至去年4月，已收回一期工程的全部投资7.5亿元。二期扩建工程，总投资仍为7.5亿元，将形成年产彩管160万只的综合生产能力，预计明年10月验收投产。
