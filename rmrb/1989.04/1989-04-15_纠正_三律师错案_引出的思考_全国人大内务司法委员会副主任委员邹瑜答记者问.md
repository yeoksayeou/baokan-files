The People's Daily published a report on the National People's Congress exercising legal supervision, which led to the correction of the wrongful arrest of lawyers in Anshan, Liaoning. This report has sparked strong reactions in the legal community and throughout society. With questions about how to understand the National People's Congress exercising its legal supervision powers, the reporter visited Zhou Yu, a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and deputy director of the Internal and Judicial Affairs Committee, who had participated in urging Liaoning to correct the wrongful arrest of lawyers.

Q: What lessons can be drawn from the fact that the "Three Lawyers' Case" took four years to correct?

A: The significance of the correction of the "Three Lawyers' Case" goes far beyond the case itself. First, it has boosted people's confidence in strengthening the legal supervision work of the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee. The fact that the "Three Lawyers' Case" occurred and dragged on for four years shows that implementing legal supervision is a daunting task. Overcoming issues such as having laws but not enforcing them, enforcing laws but not strictly, ignoring violations of the law, and substituting speech for legal decisions is not easy. However, under the supervision of the National People's Congress, the "Three Lawyers' Case" was finally corrected. This itself powerfully demonstrates that holding a pessimistic attitude towards strengthening legal supervision is unfounded. Strengthening legal supervision is an intrinsic requirement of China's economic and political system reforms. Especially at a time when we need to rectify economic order, improve the economic environment, consolidate stability, unity, and a democratic and harmonious political situation, it is even more necessary to strengthen the supervision work of the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee. Strengthening legal supervision is also a requirement for the development of productive forces, a manifestation of the people's will, and a powerful driving force for China's legal system construction. This force is irresistible. The correction of the "Three Lawyers' Case" is a result of this force. People see hope and gain confidence from this. Secondly, the correction of the "Three Lawyers' Case" proves that the Internal and Judicial Affairs Committee can play a significant role in assisting with legal supervision. Although our current legal supervision system is not yet perfect, especially since the supervision law has not been formulated, the Constitution and the Organizational Law of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress have principle provisions. As long as we fully recognize that upholding legal authority is a sacred duty of people's congresses at all levels and their standing committees, seriously exercise the functions conferred by the Constitution and laws, strictly act in accordance with the law, conduct in-depth investigations and research, and are good at coordinating relationships among all parties, the Internal and Judicial Affairs Committee will definitely be able to play an important role in assisting with legal supervision. Furthermore, the correction of the "Three Lawyers' Case" provides profound enlightenment for all members of the Internal and Judicial Affairs Committee.

Q: What experiences and lessons can be learned from the correction of this wrongful arrest of lawyers?

A: Reviewing the handling process of this wrongful arrest of lawyers, I believe there are three points of experience and lessons to be learned. First, the legal awareness and professional competence of judicial personnel urgently need to be improved, especially the need to repeatedly educate them to strictly act in accordance with the law, respect the authority of lawyers, and uphold citizens' democratic rights and personal rights. Second, since the restoration of the lawyer system in China, the significant role of lawyer work in legal construction has not been recognized by people, especially judicial cadres. In recent years, various places across the country have successively seen multiple incidents of insulting, expelling, beating, and even detaining lawyers. The occurrence of the "Three Lawyers' Case" is not accidental; it is a result of long-term neglect of the important role of lawyer work in legal construction. In the future, it is necessary to further elucidate the status and role of lawyers in legal education, raise people's awareness of lawyer work, and support lawyers in performing their duties in accordance with the law. At the same time, the quality of the lawyer team also urgently needs to be improved. In recent years, the lawyer profession has developed rapidly with many new elements. With the deepening of the system reform, the problem of lawyer quality not meeting objective requirements has become quite prominent, and effective measures should be taken to quickly improve the political and professional quality of the lawyer team. Third, in addition to listening to work reports, proposing inquiries, and asking questions, the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee should also investigate some typical major wrong cases and urge relevant departments and agencies to correct them. During the process of verifying and correcting the "Three Lawyers' Case," under the leadership of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the attention of the Standing Committee of the Liaoning Provincial People's Congress, relevant departments sent personnel to conduct multiple investigations, made multiple suggestions, and requested the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to urge relevant departments to strictly enforce the law and correctly correct this case. The Supreme People's Procuratorate adopted a serious and responsible attitude towards the correction of this case, thus achieving good results and accumulating valuable experience for implementing legal supervision.

Q: What are the plans for the work of the Internal and Judicial Affairs Committee in the next step? Will there be plans to investigate several major typical cases this year?

A: The Internal and Judicial Affairs Committee, as a functional organization of the National People's Congress, has two main responsibilities: to participate in legislative work related to internal and judicial affairs under the leadership of the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee, and to assist the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in supervising various internal and judicial agencies and departments of the state. This year, in terms of assisting with supervision, we plan to focus on the following aspects: First, to carry out in-depth investigation and research work, understand and grasp the law enforcement situation of various internal and judicial agencies and departments, and the urgent problems that need to be solved, especially to help various levels of judicial agencies strengthen legal education and improve the legal awareness and legal knowledge level of judicial personnel. Second, to strengthen contact with internal and judicial specialized committees or working bodies at various levels, hold several symposiums, summarize the experiences and lessons of supervision work under the leadership of the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee, and explore theoretical issues related to assisting with supervision. Third, to inquire about and listen to work reports from various internal and judicial agencies. For the maintenance of lawyers' right to defend in accordance with the law, we will continue to pay attention to it. Lawyers in China have every reason to believe that their legal rights are protected by the law. The Internal and Judicial Affairs Committee will continue to make its own efforts to reform and improve China's lawyer system. As for whether to participate in or organize the investigation of major typical illegal cases, according to the law, specialized committees need to participate in or organize the investigation of major typical illegal cases with a bill or decision assigned by the National People's Congress or its Standing Committee. If there is such a need to handle a bill or decision this year, we will actively and seriously fulfill this responsibility.

　　纠正“三律师错案”引出的思考
  　——全国人大内务司法委员会副主任委员邹瑜答记者问
    本报记者　吴恒权
    本报发表全国人大实施法律监督，纠正了辽宁鞍山错捕律师案件的报道后，在法律界乃至整个社会都引起了强烈反响。带着如何认识人大实施法律监督权等问题，记者走访了曾参与督促辽宁纠正错捕律师案件的全国人大常委会委员、人大内务司法委员会副主任委员邹瑜同志。
    问：“三律师案”历时４年得以纠正，对此，您认为可以从中得到哪些启示？
    答：“三律师案”得以纠正，其意义远远超出案件本身。首先，它提高了人们对加强人大及其常委会法律监督工作的信心。“三律师案”之所以能够发生并且拖延了４年之久，说明实施法律监督是一项艰巨的事业，克服有法不依、执法不严、违法不究、以言代法决不是轻而易举的事。但“三律师案”在全国人大的监督下，终于得到了纠正，这本身便有力地证明，对强加法律监督持悲观态度是没有根据的。加强法律监督是我国经济体制改革是和政治体制改革的内在要求，尤其在当前整顿经济秩序、治理经济环境、巩固安定团结、民主和谐政治局面的时候，更需要加强人大及其常委会的监督工作。加强法律监督也是我国生产力发展的要求，是人民意志的体现，是我国法制建设的强大动力。这种力量是不可抗拒的。“三律师案”的纠正，正是这种力量推动的结果。人们从这里看到了希望，提高了信心。其次，“三律师案”的纠正，证明人大内务司法委员会协助进行法律监督是可以大有作为的。尽管我们现在监督的法制还不健全，特别是监督法尚未制定，但宪法和人大常委会组织法都有原则规定，只要充分认识维护法律权威是各级人民代表大会及其常委会的神圣职责，认真行使宪法，法律赋予的这些职能，严格依法办事，深入调查研究，善于协调各方面的关系，人大内务司法委员会就一定能够在协助法律监督方面发挥重要作用。另外“三律师案”的纠正对于内务司法委员会全体人员也深刻的启示。
    问：纠正这起错捕律师案件，有哪些值得吸取的经验教训？
    答：纵观这起错捕律师案件的处理过程，我认为有三点经验教训可资吸取。一是司法工作人员的法制观念和业务素质亟待提高，特别是需要反复教育他们严格依法办事，尊重律师的职权，维护公民的民主权利和人身权利。二是我国律师制度恢复以来，律师工作在法律建设中的重大作用还没有被人们特别是司法干部所认识。最近几年，全国各地陆续发生过多起侮辱、驱逐、殴打甚至拘禁律师的事件。“三律师案”的发生，并非偶然，这是我们长期以来忽视律师工作在法制建设中重要作用所导致的后果。今后有必要在普法教育中进一步阐明律师的地位和作用，提高人们对律师工作的认识，支持律师依法履行职务。同时，律师队伍的素质也亟需提高。近几年律师除伍发展迅速，新成份较多，随着体制改革的深入开展，律师素质不能适应客观要求的问题也比较突出，应当采取得力措施，尽快提高律师队伍的政治素质和业务素质。三是人大及其常委会在实施法律监督中，除了听取工作汇报，提出质询，询问等方式外，还应调查一些有典型意义的重大错案，并督促有关部门、机关进行纠正。这次查核纠正“三律师案”过程中，在全国人大常委会的领导和辽宁省人大常委会的重视下，有关部门派员进行过多次调查，多次提出建议，请人大常委会督促有关部门严肃执法，正确纠正此案。最高人民检察院对此案的纠正采取了严肃认真的态度，因此取得较好的效果，为实施法律监督积累了有益的经验。
    问：人大内务司法委员会下步工作有何打算，今年是否还准备调查几个重大典型案件呢？
    答：内务司法委员会作为全国人大的职能机构，其主要职责包括两个方面的内容，就是在全国人大及其常委会的领导下，参与有关内务司法方面的立法工作，协助人大常委会对国家的内务司法各机关、部门进行监督。今年在协助监督方面计划主要抓好以下几项，一是深入开展调查研究工作，了解掌握内务司法各机关、部门的执法状况及其急需解决的问题，特别是帮助各级司法机关加强法制教育，提高司法人员的法制观念和法律知识水平。二是加强同各级人大内务司法专门委会或工作机构的联系，开好几个座谈会，总结在人大及其常委会领导下进行监督工作的经验教训，探讨协助监督的理论问题。三是询问、听取内务司法各机关的工作汇报。对维护律师依法辩护的职权，还要继续给予关注。我国的律师人员完全有理由相信，他们的合法权利是受到法律保护的。人大内务司法委员会将继续为改革和完善我国的律师制度作出自己的努力。至于是否参与或组织对重大典型违法案件进行调查的问题，按照法律规定，专门委员会要参与或组织对重大典型违法案件进行调查，需有全国人大或人大常委会交付的有关议案或决定，今年如果有这样的需要处理的议案或决定，我们将会积极认真地履行这一职责。
