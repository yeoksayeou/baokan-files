Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 28th.

The third national environmental protection conference, decided by the State Council, opened today in Beijing.

Strengthening the rectification and management of the ecological environment, and establishing a strict environmental supervision system, is an urgent task. In the process of curbing basic construction, overcoming economic overheating, and adjusting the industrial structure, all enterprises and institutions that pollute the environment, whether they are state-owned, collectively-owned, or individually-owned, must be thoroughly investigated, listed, and firmly rectified. For those projects that are poorly located and severely polluting, those already completed must be rectified within a specified period, or they must be ordered to cease production and close down. This was emphasized by Song Jian, a State Councilor and Chairman of the State Council Environmental Protection Commission, in his speech at the meeting.

Li Peng, Premier of the State Council, entrusted Li Chang'an, Vice Secretary of the State Council, to preside over today's conference.

Song Jian pointed out in his speech that the environmental problems that have emerged in China, apart from factors related to natural climate change, are due to historical accumulation and limitations in economic and technological levels. However, one important reason is the lack of environmental protection laws and regulations, and ineffective supervision and management. Especially in recent years, under the situation of economic overheating, various places have blindly built a number of small-scale industrial projects that are severely polluting and poorly located, such as small paper mills. In some cities and regions, the situation of "old debts unpaid, new debts incurred" has emerged. Major sudden pollution incidents also occur from time to time.

He said that strengthening the rectification and management of the ecological environment, and establishing a strict order for environmental protection work, is an urgent task. We must develop the economy under the condition that the ecological environment can be sustained in the long term, and we must leave natural resources and environmental conditions for sustainable use for future generations.

He urged the leaders of various departments and directly-affiliated institutions of the State Council, and local governments at all levels, to truly place environmental protection on the important agenda.

Qū Gé Píng, Vice Chairman of the State Council Environmental Protection Commission, delivered a work report titled "Strive to Open Up a Path of Environmental Protection with Chinese Characteristics."

　　宋健在第三次全国环保会议上强调    
    污染环境单位要逐个整顿    
    必须限期治理，或者令其停产、关闭
    本报北京４月２８日讯  记者谢联辉报道：国务院决定召开的第三次全国环境保护会议，今天在北京开幕。
    加强对生态环境的治理和整顿，建立严格的环境监督管理，是当务之急。在压缩基本建设，克服经济过热，调整产业结构的过程中，对污染环境的企事业单位，不论是全民的还是集体的，或者个体的，都要逐个清理，列出清单，坚决整顿。对那些布局不合理、污染严重的项目，已建成的要限期治理，或者令其停产、关闭。这是国务委员、国务院环境保护委员会主任宋健在会上讲话中强调的。
    国务院总理李鹏委托国务院副秘书长李昌安主持今天的大会。
    宋健在讲话中指出，我国出现的环境问题，除大自然气候变化的因素外，有历史上长期积累的原因，也有经济技术水平限制的原因，但其中的一条重要原因是环保法制不健全，监督管理不得力所造成的。特别是近年来在经济过热的形势下，各地盲目建设了一批如小纸厂之类的污染严重、布局不当的中小工业项目，在一些城市和地区出现了“老账未还，又欠新账”的局面。重大的突发性污染事件，也时有发生。
    他说，加强对生态环境的治理和整顿，建立严格的环境保护工作的秩序，是当务之急。我们必须在保证生态环境能够长期支撑的条件下发展经济，必须为子孙后代保留永续利用的自然资源和环境条件。
    他要求国务院各部委、各直属机关、地方各级人民政府的领导同志，切实地把环境保护放到重要议事日程上来。
    国务院环委会副主任曲格平在会上作了题为《努力开拓有中国特色的环境保护道路》的工作报告。
