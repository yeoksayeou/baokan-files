It's Time to Come Out

The current economic situation is grim. The economy is in a state of stagnation, and the people are feeling the pinch. The root cause of this situation lies in the inefficiency and corruption within the state-owned enterprises. These enterprises have long been a drain on the national economy, and it is high time that we address this issue head-on.

For too long, we have been shielding these enterprises from the harsh realities of the market. We have provided them with subsidies and protection, but this has only served to perpetuate their inefficiency. It is time to let the market play its role and allow these enterprises to sink or swim on their own. Only then can we hope to see a true revival of the economy.

The government must take decisive action to reform these state-owned enterprises. This means cutting off the subsidies and allowing the market to determine their fate. It also means holding the management and workers accountable for their performance. Those who cannot adapt to the new economic realities must be willing to make the necessary sacrifices.

The people are suffering, and they deserve better. It is time for the government to act boldly and decisively. The future of our economy depends on it. Let us not shy away from the difficult decisions that need to be made. Let us come out and face the challenges head-on. The time for action is now.
