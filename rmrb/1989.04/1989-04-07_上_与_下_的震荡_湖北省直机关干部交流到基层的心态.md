The year of the snake began with a blanket of snow covering the three towns of Wuhan in Hubei Province. However, a discussion about the "up" and "down" in cadre exchanges has become a hot topic in the three towns, causing ripples in people's hearts.

Before the Spring Festival, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China made a decision to select a batch of outstanding section and bureau-level cadres from the provincial direct organizations to exchange positions to the prefectures, cities, states, and counties to serve as deputy party and government officials. In addition to having a sense of duty, good work style, strong party spirit, courage to reform, and the ability to work, these exchanged cadres must also have their relationships transferred and their family members' household registration transferred! If they fail to be re-elected during the term, they will become ordinary citizens locally.

The news first caused a stir in the provincial direct organizations, signaling that promotion comes with risks. If one's performance is mediocre, they will lose their official hat and the whole family will not be able to return to the big city...

"Life is short, and at the age of 30, it is the best time to pursue a career. One should go down quickly and not hesitate!"

"This guy is lucky, queuing in the provincial direct organizations for ten years, and now he has become a deputy governor!"

"Do a few years of 'gold plating,' and then return to the provincial city!"

"No way! If you go down without a backer and 'connections,' what if you fail to be re-elected in the future? You might regret it!"

"The Organization Department is coming up with bad ideas. If you want to go down, let the individuals go down. Why should the whole family go down? Is it to show off?"

When the list of 27 deputy section-level and more than 70 deputy bureau-level cadres recommended by various departments, offices, commissions, bureaus, and agencies was submitted to the Provincial Committee's Organization Department, dramatic scenes unfolded:

One cadre said his wife had a recurrence of neurasthenia, with a hospital certificate to prove it;

Another comrade reported to his superiors: his wife's heart disease had worsened;

One wife half-jokingly told her husband: "If you go down, we might as well get a divorce!"

More polite family members expressed: "He can be a cadre, and I can do my own job. Why should women be attached to men?!"

Street talk and rumors spread. The Hubei Provincial Committee's Organization Department held three extensive meetings to listen to the opinions of the masses and the individuals involved. Based on voluntary applications, they conducted thorough investigations of the exchange candidates recommended by various units. Leaders of the supervising departments and colleagues from the Organization Department had heart-to-heart talks with them. Determination, confidence, concerns, difficulties, suggestions, and demands were all openly discussed, with no reservations towards the party and the organization.

Through these heart-to-heart talks, misunderstandings and practical difficulties were resolved with mutual understanding and support. Most of the cadres participating in the up-and-down exchanges were filled with strong aspirations, determined to go to the grassroots to strive and achieve great things! On the scale of family and career, their beliefs were elevated after a painful struggle and comparison.

Li Zongbo, a 38-year-old member of the Communist Party, had a confident look in his eyes. This responsible person from the Provincial Planning Commission's Office was always at the top of the list in the first and second rounds of voting and recommendations among the cadres. When the Provincial Committee's Standing Committee decided to let him serve as the deputy mayor of Yichang, Li Zongbo was not surprised, because he knew that Yichang was a newly established medium-sized city with relatively harsh conditions. His attitude was: personal interests should be subordinated to the organization, and small matters should be subordinated to big matters. This time, going down to the grassroots, for him, meant his wife would have to give up her ideal job at the Provincial Government's Office of General Affairs, his son would have to leave the top primary school in the province, and they would have to give up their spacious and comfortable apartment.

"Will you be prepared to break the peaceful and stable life and adapt to the new environment?" Facing the reporter's question, Comrade Li Zongbo recounted the intense whirlwind that had passed through his heart. "Some people say, 'People go up, water flows down. Since you are an outstanding cadre, you can be promoted in the province. Why do you have to go down?' Others say, 'You have a good foundation in the office. Isn't it safer to be promoted to a deputy bureau-level position in the province than to go down?' In the face of public opinion, at the time when the party needs me, my answer is: people are not for the sake of being officials, because I am a member of the Communist Party, and my career is at the grassroots!"

Chen Zhenyi is a section chief of the Provincial Petroleum Company, 37 years old, and very shrewd. His monthly salary in the company, excluding subsidies, is 166 yuan, while going to Gu Cheng County to serve as a deputy county magistrate, with a salary increase of one level, is only 122 yuan. He and his wife have been separated for more than four years, and his wife had just managed to transfer to the Provincial Commercial Bureau's kindergarten. The newly settled small family was once again stirred up by a notice. When he sought his wife's opinion, he was given three sentences: "First, it's a good thing for you to go to the county to work; second, I won't drag you down; third, I won't go with you." At this time, friends, classmates, and fellow villagers all came to persuade Chen Zhenyi: "For the sake of the child's future, you can't go down. It will be more convenient to study in a university in the provincial city, and at least the admission score line is lower than in the counties," "It's not easy to come to a big city. You should think carefully!" "At least the child's household registration can't go down." Facing the reduction in salary income and the actual difficulties of the family, after talking with the comrades from the Provincial Committee's Organization Department, Chen Zhenyi expressed: doing work is not just for money. One can correctly handle the reduction in economic income and not suffer a big loss. At the same time, the Provincial Committee's Organization Department and Gu Cheng County also properly arranged his wife's work, trying to accommodate the work and family life. Chen Zhenyi sighed, "People should be reasonable. Others go down and get a salary increase, but I get a salary decrease. At first, I couldn't understand it, but for the sake of the overall situation, making some personal sacrifices and suffering some economic losses is nothing." Soon, he happily told me that his wife had agreed and would move immediately, with the couple going to Gu Cheng together.

The only one who was demoted from a deputy section-level position to the grassroots was Luo Haifeng from the Provincial Procuratorate. His colleagues around him did not understand why he wanted to be demoted. The 33-year-old Xiao Luo confidently replied: "I want to use my actions to challenge the idea of 'can go up but not down, can go to the city but not to the countryside,' aiming to achieve something in the vast countryside!"

Zhang Laosheng, the son of an old revolutionary cadre, was born in prison and is now the director of the Research Office of the Provincial Committee's Organization Department. This time, the Provincial Committee decided to let him serve as the deputy director of the Xianning Administrative Bureau. Zhang Laosheng's wife was also willing to give up her position as the deputy director of the Commercial Bureau of the Provincial Financial Office and pack her bags with him. Some people secretly commented: "They have a background, and it will definitely be easier for them to return to the provincial city in the future," "Look, it's hard to be promoted in the provincial direct organizations, but going down is a deputy provincial-level position!" Zhang Laosheng responded with a calm smile and told the reporter: "Comments can be understood, but the key is to look at the actions!"

Starting from February 27, the first batch of 23 section and bureau-level cadres from the Hubei Provincial direct organizations, along with their families, began to take up their posts in 14 prefectures, cities, and states, and 9 counties and cities.

The wheels rolled, and the train whistle blew. Listen to the middle-aged cadre Li Wenzhao's words before he went to work in the Yichang region: "Party cadres are like bricks, moved wherever needed, not only can they be moved, but they can also be placed steadily." No wonder an old comrade from the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee happily exclaimed: "We old comrades strongly support the Provincial Committee's decision to exchange cadres. From these middle-aged and young cadres, we see the excellent traditions of the party being carried on, and the party and the country's cause having successors and prospering."

　　“上”与“下”的震荡
    ——湖北省直机关干部交流到基层的心态
    新华社记者  方政军
    蛇年伊始，瑞雪给湖北省武汉三镇披上了银装。然而，一场关于干部交流中上与下的议论却成了三镇的“热点”，在人们心中引起震荡。
    春节前，中共湖北省委作出决定，从省直机关选调一批优秀处、科级干部交流到地、市、州、县任党、政副职。对这些交流干部的要求，除了有事业心、作风好、党性强、勇于改革、工作有能力等政治条件外，还要各种关系随转，家属户口随迁！如果换届落选，就地当“老百姓”。
    一石激起千层浪。这个消息首先在省直机关引起震动，它意味着“官”升一“品”、风险伴随，若是政绩平平，丢了乌纱帽，全家又回不了大城市……
    “人生能有几次搏，而立之年，正是干事业的好时光，该下快下，切莫迟疑！”
    “这小子划得来，在省直机关排队，十年媳妇熬成婆，这不，一下子混上了副专员！”
    “搞几年，‘镀层金’，再回省城也不迟嘛！”
    “不行！你下去没有后台，没有‘关系’，将来万一换届落选，全家甩在下面怎么办？恐怕追悔莫及哩！”
    “组织部尽出‘馊点子’，要下就当事人下，何必要全家下，是不是出风头？”
    当各部办委厅局拟定的２７名正处和７０多名正科级干部名单汇集到省委组织部时，戏剧性的情节出现了：
    一干部说，他的爱人神经官能症复发了，有医院证明；
    某同志向上级报告：他老婆的心脏病患得厉害了；
    有位夫人半真半假地对丈夫说：“你要下去，我们就干脆离婚！”
    较客气的家属则表示：“他当他的干部，我干我的工作，为什么还要女人成为男人的附属物？！”
    街谈巷议、沸沸扬扬。湖北省委组织部三次广泛听取群众和本人意见，在自愿报名的基础上，对各单位推荐的交流对象全面深入考察，主管部门的领导和组织部的同志与他们开展交心谈心。决心、信心、顾虑、困难、建议、要求，都可以敞开思想，掏心里话，对党、对组织，毫不保留。
    思想隔阂、实际困难，在交心的过程中得到互相理解和相互支持。大多数参加上下交流的干部都怀着强烈的愿望，决心到基层去拚搏，去建功立业！在家庭与事业的天平上，他们中多数人的信念经过一番痛苦的斗争和较量后又得到了升华。
    李宗柏，一位３８岁的共产党员，眼睛里透出自信的目光。这位省计划委员会办公室负责人，在机关干部一二轮投票推荐中总是名列前茅。省委常委决定让他去担任宜昌市副市长时，李宗柏并不惊讶，因为他了解，宜昌是一个新建不久的中等城市，条件比较艰苦。他的态度是：个人服从组织，小局服从大局。这回下基层，对他来说，爱人要丢掉省政府机关事务管理局的理想工作，儿子要离开全省第一流的重点小学，还有三室一厅的漂亮住房。
    “平稳，安宁的生活要打破了，适应新的环境有思想准备吗？”面对记者的提问，李宗柏同志诉述了他内心卷过的激烈旋涡。“有人说，‘人往高处走，水往低处流，既然是优秀干部，在省里照样可以提拔，为什么还要往下搞？’也有人说，‘你在机关基础好，在省里提个副厅级不是比下去更保险吗？’在社会舆论面前，在党需要我的时候，我的回答是：人不是为了当官，因为我是共产党员，我的事业在基层！”
    程正义是省石油公司的一位科长，今年３７岁，人很精明，他在公司月工资除去补贴是１６６元，而到谷城县去任副县长上浮一档也只１２２元。他们夫妻分居４年多，爱人前不久好不容易才调到省商业厅幼儿园工作。刚刚安定下来的小家庭，一纸通知又掀起了波澜。他征求爱人的意见时被爱人甩了三句话：“第一，你下县城工作是好事；第二，我不拖后腿；第三，我不跟你一起下。”这时，三朋四友、同乡同学都来劝程正义了：“为了小孩的前途，你不能下，将来在省城读大学也方便些，起码录取分数线比地县低”、“来大城市不容易，你要三思而行！”“起码小鬼（孩子）户口不能下”。面对工资收入的减少，家庭的实际困难，在同省委组织部同志谈心以后，程正义表示：干工作不仅是为了钱，对经济收入减少一些能正确对待，不吃大亏就行。同时，省委组织部和谷城县也妥善安排了他爱人的工作，尽量照顾工作对口和家庭生活。对此，程正义感慨地说：“人要通情达理，别人下去加工资，我却是减工资，开始是有些想不通，但为了顾全大局，个人作些牺牲，受点经济损失算不了什么。”不久，他高兴地告诉我，他爱人已满口答应，马上就搬家，夫妻双双下谷城。
    唯一由副处级平调下基层的是省检察院的罗海峰，他身边的同事对他为什么要平调下去也不理解。３３岁的小罗自信地回答：“我要用自己的行动向‘能上不能下、能城不能乡’的观念作出挑战，图的是在农村这个广阔天地里干一番事业！”
    张牢生，一位革命老干部的儿子，是在监狱里出生的，如今已是省委组织部的调研处长。这次省委决定让他担任咸宁行署副专员，张牢生的爱人也乐于放弃省财办商业处副处长的职务，和他一同打点行装。有人背后悄悄地议论：“他们夫妻俩有背景，将来再回省城比别人肯定容易”，“这不，在省直难提拔，下去就是副地级哩！”对此，张牢生报以淡然一笑，他对记者说：“议论总是可以理解的，关键是要看行动！”
    ２月２７日开始，湖北省直机关第一批２３名处科级干部陆续携家带口，赴１４个地市州和９个县市上任了。
    车轮滚滚，汽笛长鸣。请听中年干部李文钊到宜昌地区工作临行前的心声吧：“党的干部是块砖，哪里需要哪里搬，不仅搬得动，还要放得稳。”难怪省人大常委会一位老同志高兴地赞叹：“省委交流干部的这一决策我们老同志举双手拥护，从这些中青年干部身上，我们看到了党的优良传统在发扬，党和国家的事业后继有人、发达兴旺。”
