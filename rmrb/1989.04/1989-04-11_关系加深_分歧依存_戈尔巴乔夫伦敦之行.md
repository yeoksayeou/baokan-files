Gorbachev's visit to Britain, which lasted 40 hours, left an indelible mark in the history of Sino-British relations. Local public opinion believes that this visit has demonstrated the "enormous potential for improving Sino-British relations." The Soviet Union's *Pravda* newspaper believes that the visit has profound significance. It "enhances mutual understanding and strengthens mutual trust," and is a "memorable and successful visit."

This visit, which was postponed due to the Armenian earthquake, took place at a significant moment. The NATO summit will be held in Brussels next month, followed by the proposed U.S.-Soviet summit. The war in Afghanistan continues to rage. On the agenda of the Kremlin, issues such as arms control, Soviet-European, Soviet-American, and East-West relations, as well as regional conflicts, are all urgent matters that need to be addressed. Britain is a special partner of the United States, a permanent member of the Security Council, and an important member of the European Community and NATO. It also has extensive historical ties with countries and regions such as Afghanistan, the Middle East, and southern Africa. In the eyes of the Soviet Union, it is a "useful" collaborator. At the same time, Gorbachev also wanted to further understand the positions and views of Western countries on major issues such as arms control and regional conflicts, thereby preparing for his meeting with the new U.S. President Bush. In this context, observers believe that while President Bush is still carefully considering his East-West policy, Gorbachev's turn towards Europe and Britain is very natural.

As the host, Mrs. Thatcher extended high honors to Gorbachev, similar to her reception of Reagan last June, and naturally had expectations for this visit. It is said that this year is Gorbachev's "European Year." He will visit the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Italy, and the European Parliament, and he has chosen to visit Britain as the "opening act" of his "European Year." Britain wants to use this opportunity to show that it continues to play an important "bridge" role in U.S.-Soviet and even the entire East-West relations. Moreover, the more substantial goal is to further promote economic and trade relations between the two countries. Additionally, Britain hopes that the Soviet Union will improve "human rights" and adopt a cooperative stance on regional conflict issues. It hopes that the Soviet Union can exert influence on the South West Africa People's Organization and oppose South African apartheid through non-violent means.

During the visit, the leaders of Britain and the Soviet Union conducted "broad, in-depth, and friendly" "substantive dialogues" on these major international issues of common concern and bilateral relations, achieving positive results. The two countries signed a new memorandum of understanding aimed at increasing trade, as well as three agreements on investment, new visa rules, and the construction of a school in Armenia. Local newspapers reported that this visit has "warmed up" the economic and trade relations between the two countries. Equally important, Gorbachev was the first Soviet leader since 1917 to invite the British Queen to visit the Soviet Union, and the Queen has accepted the invitation. He also invited Mrs. Thatcher to visit the Soviet Union again at Heathrow Airport, indicating that Soviet-British relations have greatly improved.

However, the visit did not eliminate the differences between the two countries on some major issues. On the issue of NATO's modernization of short-range missiles, Britain still advocates for the modernization of short-range missiles, believing it is necessary for European security. Gorbachev, on the other hand, warned that if NATO continues with the modernization of short-range missiles, it would devalue the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and affect the Geneva negotiations on the reduction of conventional weapons. Gorbachev strongly advocates for a "nuclear-free world," but Britain believes that Gorbachev's ideas are too romantic and far from reality. On the issue of arms control, Gorbachev announced in his main speech that the Soviet Union would stop producing enriched uranium for nuclear weapons this year. However, in Britain's view, the Soviet Union has already stockpiled a large amount of materials that can be used to produce weapons, and this move has little practical significance.

### 关系加深　分歧依存——戈尔巴乔夫伦敦之行

　　关系加深　分歧依存
　　——戈尔巴乔夫伦敦之行
    本报记者　陈特安
    ４月７日下午３时许，撒切尔夫人在希思罗机场热烈欢送戈尔巴乔夫主席回国。苏联领导人对英国４０小时的短暂的访问在英苏关系史上留下了难忘的一页。此间舆论认为，这次访问显示了“改善英苏关系的巨大潜力”。苏联《真理报》认为访问具有深远意义，它“增进彼此了解，加强相互信任”，是一次“值得永久怀念”的成功访问。
    这次由于亚美尼亚地震而推迟的访问在目前这种时刻成行，其背景颇引人注目。北约首脑会议下月将在布鲁塞尔举行，紧随其后的美苏首脑会晤也在拟议之中，阿富汗境内的战火仍在燃烧。在克里姆林宫的议事日程上，军备控制问题、苏欧、苏美及东西方关系问题、地区冲突等问题，都急待处理。英国是美国的特殊伙伴、安理会常任理事国、欧洲共同体和北约重要成员国。它又与阿富汗、中东、南部非洲等一些冲突国家和地区有着广泛的历史联系，在苏联看来，是一个可以“发挥作用”的合作者。同时，戈尔巴乔夫也想从英国进一步摸清西方国家在军备控制、地区冲突等重大问题上的立场和主张，从而为与美国新任总统布什会晤作准备。在这种情况下，观察家们认为，在布什总统还继续对其东西方关系政策斟酌再三时，戈尔巴乔夫先转向欧洲、转向英国是很自然的。
    撒切尔夫人作为东道主，给予戈尔巴乔夫以很高的礼遇，与去年６月接待里根基本相似，自然对这次来访也有所期待。据说，今年是戈尔巴乔夫的“欧洲年”。他将访问联邦德国、法国、意大利及欧洲议会等，而他把访问英国作为“欧洲年”的“开篇”。英国正想借此表明，它在美苏以至整个东西方关系之间继续起着重要的“桥梁”作用。同时，更具实质性的目的是想进一步推进两国的经济贸易关系。此外，英国还希望苏联改善“人权”并在地区冲突问题上采取合作的立场，它希望苏联能对西南非洲人民组织施加影响，通过非暴力手段反对南非种族主义。
    访问期间，英苏领导人就上述这些共同关心的重大国际问题和双边关系问题进行了“广泛、深入、友好”的“实质性对话”，取得了积极的成果。两国签署了旨在增加贸易的新的意向书，还签署了关于投资、新签证规则以及在亚美尼亚赠建学校的三项协议。此间报纸称，这次访问使“两国经济贸易关系热乎起来了”。同样非常重要的是，戈尔巴乔夫是１９１７年以来第一位邀请英国女王访苏的苏联领导人，而女王已接受邀请。他同时在希思罗机场邀请撒切尔夫人再次访苏，这表明苏英关系已经大大改善。
    但访问未能消除两国在一些重大问题上的分歧。在北约组织短程导弹现代化问题上，英国依然主张实现短导现代化，认为这是欧洲安全的需要，而戈尔巴乔夫则警告说，如果北约继续实行短导现代化，那就有使中导条约“贬值”并影响到日内瓦裁减常规武器谈判的危险。戈尔巴乔夫在建立一个“无核武器世界”问题上大声疾呼，英国则认为，戈尔巴乔夫的想法过于浪漫，与现实相去甚远。在军备控制问题上，戈尔巴乔夫在其主旨讲话中宣布苏联今年将停止生产核武器用的浓缩铀，但在英国看来，苏联早已储存大量可供生产武器的物资，此举实际意义不大。
