The Watchtower Column

On March 11, the Lanzhou City Traffic Bureau received an urgent telegram from the Provincial Transportation Management Bureau, sent from the Qilihe Post Office in the city. The telegram, totaling 67 characters, cost 10 yuan in telegram fees. At that time, there were still three days until the meeting.

The Provincial Transportation Management Bureau and the City Traffic Bureau are both located within the Lanzhou city area, with a distance of only four bus stops between them. There are four bus routes passing through these two units, and the round-trip fare is only one or two jiao. If one rides a bicycle, it takes only 20 minutes. Additionally, both the sending and receiving units have almost every office equipped with a program-controlled telephone. Even if it costs four fen in postage, the meeting notice can be delivered within a day. It is unknown why the Provincial Transportation Management Bureau chose to spend 10 yuan to send an urgent telegram?

　　相距仅四站开会发急电
    三月十一日，兰州市交通局收到一封由省交通厅运输管理局从市区七里河邮局发的通知开会的加急电报。电文总共六十七字，电报费十元。这时，离会期还有三天。
    省运输管理局与市交通局同在兰州市区内，相距不过四站路程，有四条线路的公共汽车经过这两个单位，往返车票仅需一两角钱；骑自行车只要二十分钟。另外收、发报单位几乎每个办公室都装有程控电话。倘若花四分邮资也可以将会议通知在一天内送达。不知省运输管理局为何要花十元钱拍加急电报？
