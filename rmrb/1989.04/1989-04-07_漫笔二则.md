Two Random Jottings

1
The recently concluded sessions of the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference saw some individuals proposing that reforms have encountered difficulties, and that the people and the government should join forces to rectify and manage the situation, overcome difficulties, and not just complain. Complaining is not good, and I agree with that. Recently, I wrote a humorous poem for a friend, advising him to "keep your intestines intact and live long," and that one day our moods will be much better. The character "骚" originally means worry, and "牢" also carries the meaning of worry. Today, it is often extended to mean expressing grievances. Therefore, complaining sometimes also carries the meaning of worry, and it is not always negative. It depends on how it is expressed and how it is received.

Our country's classical literary masterpiece, Qu Yuan's "Li Sao," is a highly artistic piece of work that expresses worries for the country and the people. But it has not only become a classic in China for thousands of years, educating patriotic and people-loving individuals, but it has also made the author one of the greatest world figures, educating readers around the world.

Even in modern times, there are those who say that during the War of Resistance, the Kuomintang government closed off our Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, attempting to suppress the people's power. Our Party Central Committee launched the "Reduce the Number of Officials and Simplify Administration" campaign and conducted a grand production movement, breaking through the reactionary blockade. This was inspired by a complaint from a local official in Yan'an: "In this small, poor place, so many anti-Japanese troops and young people from all over the country have come, all eating millet. How can we manage?" (The original words were even more harsh.) It was a complaint, but the person who heard it did not frown or grimace but was suddenly enlightened. The complaint greatly benefited the revolution and the people's interests, drawing strength from the complaint.

Time flies, and March 1989 has passed. On March 18, the morning and evening radio and television broadcasters only mentioned in passing that 63 years ago today, there was a massacre of young students and citizens in front of the Executive Yuan in Beijing. Only the "Consumer Times" had an article by Shao Yanxiang commemorating the event. Many young people today hardly know about this day, and those who do have forgotten it. Instead, there are reports in some newspapers a few days earlier that published the reminiscences of the descendants of Duan Qirui, seemingly trying to exonerate him. They say that the person who ordered the shooting was not Duan Qirui, as he was playing weiqi at the time, focusing on the black and white stones. Someone came to report that many students were causing trouble at the gate. He said while playing, "Persuade them to leave peacefully, do not use force." Soon, they heard the sound of gunfire outside, and it turned out that a man surnamed Jia had ordered the shooting, causing a big incident. Jia came to report to Duan, who was furious, patting his side and finding no gun, said, "This time, I just happened not to have a gun, otherwise I would have shot you dead right now." The Executive Yuan, with guns inside and outside the gate, just happened to have the ruler without a gun, so Jia remained unharmed and continued to issue orders within the Executive Yuan.

Not only has "March 18" been forgotten, but there are also people coming out to exonerate Duan Qirui. Shouldn't the editors of newspapers and magazines be more cautious about such articles that use "reminiscences" to exonerate someone?

　　漫笔二则
    一
    刚刚闭幕的人大与政协会上，有人提出改革遇到困难，人民与政府正应共同协力，整顿、治理，克服困难，光发牢骚，是消极的，无补于实际。牢骚不好，我很同意。最近为一友人打油，就劝他“肠莫断，寿要高”，必有一天我们的心情是会舒畅的。“骚”，本训为忧，牢，亦有忧意，今多引申抒发不平者为发牢骚。故牢骚有时也有忧的意义，不都是消极的，要看怎样发，听的人怎样听。
    我国古典文学伟大作品屈原的《离骚》，就是一篇忧国忧民的艺术性极高的大牢骚。但它不仅成为中国千古名著，数千年来教育了我国爱国爱民之士，甚至使作者成为最大的世界名人之一，也教育了全世界的读者。
    即在今代，也有人说，抗战期内，国民党政府封闭我陕北抗日民主根据地，企图扼杀人民力量，我党中央发动了“精兵简政”，搞轰轰烈烈的大生产运动，冲破了反动的封锁，这是听了延安一位地方人士的牢骚起头的：“我们这么一块小地方，穷地方，来了那么多抗日的部队，和全国投奔来的抗日青年，都要吃小米，怎么得了？”（大意，原话还说得难听些。）是一句牢骚话，但听的人并不疾首蹙额，而翻然有所启发，却使牢骚大大有利于革命，有利于人民的利益，从牢骚中吸取了力量。

    光阴正快，一九八九年三月也过去了。“三·一八”那一天，只在早上广播，晚上电视的广播员口里提了一句六十三年前的今天，北京执政府前有一场对青年学生与市民群众的大屠杀。另外报纸只见到《消费时报》有邵燕祥的纪念文字。这日子好些年轻人几乎已不知道了，知道的人也淡忘了。倒是有什么报，早几天已发表了段祺瑞后人的回忆，似乎为他先人翻案。说下令杀人的不是段祺瑞，那时他正和人下围棋，一心对付黑白子。有人来报告，大门口来了许多学生闹事。他一边下棋，一边说：“好好劝走，不可动武”。一会儿就听到了外边的枪声大作，原来是个姓贾的下令开枪，出了大事。贾来向段汇报，段氏大怒，摸了摸自己的身边，恰巧没带手枪，就说：“这回恰巧我没带枪，要不马上把你一枪打死”。堂堂执政府，门前府内，有的是枪，偏偏执政自己没带，于是贾乃无恙，依然是在执政府内发号施令的大官。
    “三·一八”不仅被人忘怀，而且还有人出来为段祺瑞翻案了。如此这般以“回忆”之名行翻案之实的文章，报刊杂志的编者难道不该慎之又慎吗？
