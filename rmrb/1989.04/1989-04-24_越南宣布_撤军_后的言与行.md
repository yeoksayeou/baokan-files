Since the Vietnamese authorities announced their withdrawal from Cambodia on May 5, people have been closely watching Vietnam's movements with a cautious eye.

Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila visited the Thai-Cambodian border for two days, from April 21 to 22, to clarify the progress of Vietnam's withdrawal. He listened to reports from Thai border troops about the situation on the Cambodian border and within Cambodia. In the border regions of Sa Kaeo and Trat provinces, Siddhi learned that Vietnam not only had not withdrawn its troops but had instead intensified military activities, making the border situation tense again. Across the border in Cambodia, Vietnamese forces had been massing troops since early this month, using tanks and artillery to repeatedly sweep through Cambodian resistance forces and seize strategic locations. During the fierce battles, many Vietnamese shells fell into Thai territory, forcing Thai civilians to retreat. Siddhi expressed his bewilderment, stating, "Since Vietnam announced it would withdraw all troops by September, it should be in a state of ceasefire now. Why is there constant fighting?"

Observers here believe that Vietnam is trying to secure more territory for the Heng Samrin regime to use as bargaining chips in future political negotiations. Later, during his visit to the border in Prachin Buri province, Siddhi learned that Vietnamese troops in that area had withdrawn 15-20 kilometers from the border, but the area was still controlled by Heng Samrin's forces. It is said that before withdrawing, the Vietnamese had engaged in a fierce battle with the resistance forces to ensure that Heng Samrin's forces occupied favorable positions and territory.

To ensure the Heng Samrin regime can stand firm in the future, the Vietnamese authorities are using two main tactics: First, they are disguising some Vietnamese troops by incorporating them into Heng Samrin's forces. The intelligence chief of the Sa Kaeo-Trat joint border defense forces, Ban Det, reported to Siddhi that "Vietnam did not withdraw 50,000 troops as it announced last December. Only 20,000 wounded soldiers were withdrawn, and these were later replaced by new troops sent by Vietnam. These newly added troops were immediately dressed in Heng Samrin's military uniforms and incorporated into the fake army. They are trying to make these new soldiers quickly master the Khmer language." Therefore, by September, when Vietnam withdraws, there will still be genuine Vietnamese troops in Cambodia." The Vietnamese authorities, fearing their plot will be exposed, have repeatedly refused effective international supervision during their announcements of withdrawal.

Vietnam's other tactic is to demand a halt to aid for Cambodian resistance forces to weaken their strength. Vietnam has never abandoned this condition in its announcements of withdrawal. Recently, Vietnamese Ambassador Ly Mai in Bangkok spoke at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Thailand, hinting that "if foreign aid to Cambodian resistance forces continues until September 30, then the 'People's Republic of Kampuchea' can request foreign military assistance." This statement caused a stir in the Thai media.

Observing Vietnam's actions and words after announcing its withdrawal, one can only conclude that Vietnam still does not want to give up the benefits it has gained from its decade-long invasion of Cambodia.

### 越南宣布“撤军”后的言与行

　　越南宣布“撤军”后的言与行
    本报记者  刘爱成
    自本月５日越南当局再次宣布从柬撤军以来，人们一直以审慎的目光注视着越南的动向。
    泰国外交部长西提为了弄清越南撤军的进展情况，于本月２１日至２２日对泰柬边境进行了两天巡视，听取了泰国边防部队对柬泰边境及柬国内战场形势的报告。在庄他武里府和达叻府边境地区，西提外长了解到，目前越南不但没有撤军，反而加紧了军事活动，使边境局势再度紧张。在庄他武里府和达叻府对面的柬埔寨境内，越军自本月初以来，大量集结部队，在坦克大炮配合下多次扫荡柬抵抗力量，抢占战略要地。激战过程中，越军有大量炮弹落入泰境，迫使泰国边民后撤，西提外长对此大为“不解”，指出，“越南既然宣布９月份全部撤军，目前理应休战才是，何以整日战火频仍”。此间观察家们分析认为，越南这样干，意在为韩桑林部队争取更多的地盘，以作为今后政治谈判讨价还价的筹码。西提外长后来在泰国巴真府边境巡视时得知，该府对面一带的越军目前已从边界线后撤了１５—２０公里，但仍由韩桑林部队把守。据说越军在后撤前为了使韩桑林部队占据有利地形和地盘也曾在那里与抵抗力量发生过一场激战。
    为了使韩桑林政权日后能站住脚，越南当局正用两种主要手段：一是将部分越军改头换面编入韩桑林政权部队，庄他武里—达叻府联合边防部队情报局长班滴向西提外长报告说，“越南并没有像它去年１２月宣布的那样从柬撤走５万部队。越南撤走的只是两万伤残兵员。而这些兵员后来又由越南派遣的新部队所补充。这些重新补充进来的部队被立即换上韩桑林部队军装编入伪军。他们正设法让这些新兵尽快地掌握柬语。”“所以到９月份越南撤军时，将仍会有真正的越军留在柬埔寨。”越南当局担心其阴谋被人戳穿，所以它在历次宣布撤军时都一再拒绝切实有效的国际监督。
    越南的另一个手段是要求停止对柬抵抗力量的援助，以削弱抵抗力量。越南在宣布撤军时从未放弃过这个条件。最近，越南驻泰国大使黎梅在曼谷外国记者俱乐部发表演讲时放风说，“到９月３０日截止，如果仍有外国对柬抵抗力量继续提供援助，那么‘柬埔寨人民共和国’就可以要求外军驰援。”越南大使的这番话在此间舆论界为之哗然。
    观察越南宣布撤军后的言与行，人们只能得出这样的结论：越南至今仍不愿放弃它十年侵柬的既得利益。
