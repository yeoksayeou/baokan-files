Title: Without Scholars, What Then?

In recent years, many leaders often said: Without agriculture, there is no stability; without industry, there is no prosperity; without commerce, there is no vitality. Later, someone added: Without the military, there is no security. These statements are all correct and very succinct. However, there is still an important aspect missing—what about without scholars?

Scholars refer to knowledge, culture, science, and education, as well as intellectuals and talents.

A few months ago, I raised this question to some comrades. Later, some newspapers and magazines published this question. I think, publishing it is also good, let the society's people of insight think about it together.

Indeed, within half a month, I received three letters forwarded by the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, all of which were responses to "Without Scholars, What Then?" Even if the response is weak, it is better than being ignored. I apologize for not seeking their consent, but I will excerpt the contents of the three letters below. I feel that although the letters are written to me personally, the discussions are about matters of concern to the entire society and nation.

Chen Shui Gen from the Jiangxi Nanchang Oil and Fat Chemical Factory wrote:
"I personally think the answer should be: Without scholars, there is no prosperity. Prosperity means thriving. 'An army without culture is a stupid army,' similarly, a group without culture is a stupid group. Without scholars, our cause will not thrive and develop.

"I am an ordinary citizen, and I am in touch with the practices of the masses. I think, to achieve the Four Modernizations, it is unimaginable without improving the cultural quality of the entire nation. Whether internationally or domestically, examples of suffering due to low cultural quality are everywhere. You, sir, know more than I do (this is not necessarily true.—Bing Xin note). This should be of concern to leaders, especially decision-makers, and should be put on the important agenda for discussion.

"Every nation needs a spiritual pillar, especially in the era of reform and opening up, this is even more important. The construction of this pillar requires the cultural quality and moral cultivation of the entire nation to be united. There is no other way. Therefore, it is imperative and natural to value cultural knowledge, value moral cultivation, value intellectuals, and improve the social status of teachers."

Yang Junyu from the Heilongjiang Qiqihar Seeking Truth New Energy Research Institute wrote:
"Currently, our country is undergoing the Four Modernizations, aiming to build a civilized and prosperous nation. Otherwise, we will face the risk of being 'kicked out of the game.' Therefore, I have realized the answer to the question you raised, which is 'Without scholars, there is no prosperity.' Adding this sentence makes it complete. Whether it is appropriate, please correct me and the members of the Political Consultative Conference."

A person from Sichuan Chengdu, Box 513, provided a detailed explanation of this question. He said:
"Scholars refer to intellectuals. It is closely related to knowledge, science, and social civilization. For China to become rich and strong, and for the Chinese nation to revive, we need democracy and science. But ultimately, we need science. Because democracy is also a kind of science, it belongs to the category of social science. Everything, whether it is the Party, politics, agriculture, industry, commerce, or education, if it goes against science, it will inevitably receive the appropriate punishment and produce forces that hinder social development. It is hard to imagine that in a country filled with illiterates, with backward science and culture, and low social morality, a modernized nation can be built. Those who lack education and cultural cultivation cannot do a good job in modernizing; those who manage in a chaotic manner cannot establish a new socialist economic order; those who engage in speculation, flattery, and seek personal gain through power can only bring disorder to the entire society. This is a very obvious truth. Our China is still in a backward position among the world's nations. The reason is not laziness, nor poverty, but the evil consequences of long-term lack of democracy and not valuing science. Lack of democratic institutions and democratic concepts will inevitably hinder the development of science and culture and social progress, while scientific and technological backwardness, low cultural quality, and low social productivity will maintain the continuation of undemocratic institutions. Such a vicious cycle makes society stagnant.

"To promote the process of democratization and the development of science and technology, we must first cultivate more scholars and produce more useful talents. Education is the foundation of the revitalization of China, and we must not think that running schools not only does not make money but also spends a lot of money, and then abandon this fundamental task of a thousand years to do some foolish things that seek quick success and instant benefits; nor should we only emphasize education in words and documents, but not do one or two practical things.

"So, to the question raised by the elder Bing Xin, this youngster's answer is just one sentence: Without scholars, there is no prosperity!"

The three of them, although living in different parts of the country, expressed the same meaning. It seems that people share the same heart, and I seem to have nothing more to say. I only hope that leaders and leading departments will listen to the voices of ordinary people and ordinary intellectuals, and more importantly, pay attention to the serious and far-reaching consequences of "without scholars." "History is a mirror," just recall the disasters caused by trampling on knowledge, persecuting intellectuals, and launching a cultural revolution during the ten years of turmoil, isn't it clear?

Time passes quickly, and the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement is just around the corner. Seventy years ago, a group of pioneers in the fields of thought and culture, at a time when the country was in chaos, raised the banner of democracy and science, and launched an attack on feudal forces, warlord forces, and imperialist forces, opening a new page in China's modern history. Seventy years later, we must still loudly proclaim: Let Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science take root, sprout, bloom, and bear fruit on this ancient land of China. If we do not value "scholars," do not value science, education, and culture, Mr. Democracy and Mr. Science will become empty talk, and modernization will become mere paper talk.

### 无士则如何

专栏：

　　无士则如何
　　冰心
    前几年，不少领导人常说：无农不稳，无工不富，无商不活。其后，又有人加了一句：无兵不安。这些话都对，概括得也非常准确。可惜尚缺一个重要方面——无士怎么样呢？
    士，就是知识、文化、科学、教育，就是知识分子、人才。
    几个月前，我曾向一些同志提出这个问题。后来有的报刊将我这问题公开发表了。我想，发表也好，让社会上各方有识之士来一起思索吧。
    果然，半个月中，我就收到有全国政协转来三封信件，都是“无士则如何”的回响。即使是微弱的回响，也比石沉大海要好。恕我没有征求他们的同意，将三封信的内容摘录如下。因为我觉得信虽是写给我个人的，而谈论的却是全社会、全民族所关心和应该关心的大事。
    江西南昌油脂化工厂陈水根的信中说：
    “我个人认为答案应是无士不兴。兴者，旺盛之谓也。‘没有文化的军队是愚蠢的军队’，同样，没有文化的群体是愚蠢的群体。无士，我们的事业就不会兴旺发达。
    “我是一个普通老百姓，接触的是大众的实践。我认为，要实现四个现代化，不提高全民族的文化素质是不可思议的。无论在国际还是在国内，吃亏在文化素质低的例子俯拾皆是。您老知道的比我更多（这倒未必。——冰心注）。这要引起领导们的重视，尤其是决策者的重视，要把提高全民族的文化素质提到重要议事日程上来议议。
    “任何民族都需要有一精神支柱，尤其是当今改革开放的时代，尤显重要。这支柱的建造需要全民族的文化素质与道德修养凝聚。舍此别无他路。因此，要重视文化知识，重视道德修养，重视知识分子、提高教师的社会地位是势在必行、理所当然的事。”
    黑龙江齐齐哈尔市求是新能源研究所杨俊宇同志信中说：
    “目前我们国家正在进行四化建设，目的是要建成文明昌盛的国家。否则，我们就有被开除‘球籍’的危险了。因此，我悟出了您所提的问题的答案，这就是‘无士不昌’。加上这句，就完整了。是否有当，请您及政协委员们给以指正。”
    四川成都５１３信箱余人同志对这个问题更作了详尽的阐述。他说：
    “士者，知识分子也。它是和知识、科学、社会文明紧密联系的代名词。中国要富强，中华要振兴，一要靠民主，二要靠科学。但归根到底是要靠科学。因为民主也是一种科学，它属于社会科学范畴。一切事物，党也好，政也好，农也好，工也好，商也好，教也好，如果违背了科学而行事，必将受到应有的惩罚，产生阻碍社会发展的破坏力量。很难想象，在一个文盲充塞、科学文化落后、社会道德水平低下的国度能建设现代化的国家。靠缺乏教育和文化修养的人不能搞好现代化事业；靠杂乱无章的管理不能建立社会主义经济新秩序；靠投机诈骗、阿谀奉承、以权谋私之徒，只能搞乱整个社会。这是再明显不过的道理。我们中国在世界民族之林中还处于落后地位，究其原因，不是因为懒惰，也不是因为贫穷，而是长时期缺乏民主和不重视科学所造成的恶果。缺乏民主制度和民主观念，必然阻碍科学文化的发展和社会的进步，而科技落后、文化素质低，社会生产力低下，又维持了不民主制度的延续。如此恶性循环，就使社会停滞不前。
    “要促进民主化进程，促进科学技术发展，首先就要培养更多的士，造成更多的有用之材。而教育，又是振兴中华的基础工程，切不可认为办教育不但不赚钱、反而花大钱而丢了这项千年大计的根本，去办那些急功近利的蠢事；更不要只把重视教育挂在口头上，写在文件中，而不去办一件两件实实在在的事。
    “所以，对冰心老前辈所提问题，我这个后生小子的答案，只有一句话：无士不兴！”
    他们三位身在天南地北，却不约而同地说了同一个意思。可见人同此心，心同此理，我也似乎无需再多说什么了。我只希望领导者和领导部门谛听一下普通群众、普通知识分子的心声，更要重视“无士”的严重而深远的后果。“殷鉴不远”，只要回想一下十年大乱中践踏知识、摧残知识分子、大革文化命所造成的灾难，还不清楚吗？
    岁月易得，“五四”运动７０周年就在眼前。七十年前，一批思想界、文化界的先锋人物，于国事蜩螗之时高举民主和科学大旗，向封建势力、军阀势力和帝国主义势力冲击，揭开中国的现代史页。时隔七十年，我们今天还是要大声疾呼：要让德先生、赛先生在中国这个古老的土地上生根、发芽、开花、结果。如果不重视“士”，不重视科学、教育、文化，德先生和赛先生就成了空谈，现代化也会流于纸上谈兵。
