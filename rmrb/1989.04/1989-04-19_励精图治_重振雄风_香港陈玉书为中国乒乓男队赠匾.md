Sending a plaque to a defeated sports team is a rare occurrence in Chinese sports. Chen Yushu, the general manager of the Hong Kong Prosperity Group Company, who is currently in Beijing attending the municipal political consultative conference, presented a plaque to the Chinese men's table tennis team tonight at the Kunlun Hotel in Beijing. The plaque reads: "Strive for Excellence and Revive the Spirit."

All members of the Chinese table tennis team attended the plaque presentation ceremony. Chen Yushu, known as the "King of Cloisonné," spoke emotionally: "Victory and defeat are common in sports, but the important thing is not to lose heart. I am willing to cheer for the young men of the table tennis team and be their support." Chen Yushu mentioned that he heard that Comrade Zhao Ziyang had inquired about the situation of the Chinese men's team before his passing, and he hoped that the team members would not disappoint Comrade Zhao Ziyang's expectations.

Head coach of the Chinese table tennis team, Xu Shaofa, said that in his 30 years as an athlete and then as a coach, he had experienced both success and failure. "But this time, the failure was quite thorough. However, we have not lost our confidence. In the near future, we will regain the lost championship." Xu Shaofa revealed that a group of veteran athletes, such as Jiang Jialiang, will retire, and the young team members are determined to take over quickly.

　　励精图治　重振雄风
　　香港陈玉书为中国乒乓男队赠匾
    本报北京４月１９日讯　为一支失利的运动队送匾，这在中国体育界尚不多见。正在北京参加市政协会议的香港繁荣集团公司董事总经理陈玉书先生，今晚在北京昆仑饭店向在第四十届世乒赛上失利的中国男队赠送了一块匾，匾上写着：“励精图治，重振雄风”。
    中国乒乓球队的全体成员均出席了赠匾仪式，享有“景泰蓝大王”之称的陈玉书在即席发言中十分动情地说：胜败乃兵家常事，重要的是不要输掉志气，他愿意为乒乓球队的小伙子们打气并做后盾。陈玉书谈起，他听说耀邦同志逝世前夕还过问了失利后的中国男队的情况，他希望队员不要辜负耀邦同志的期望。
    中国乒乓球队总教练许绍发说，他从当运动员到教练员的３０年中，有过成功亦有过失败，“但从未像这次，失败得比较彻底，但是我们没有把信心失掉，不久的将来，我们要夺回失掉的冠军”。许绍发透露，一批老运动员，如江嘉良等将退役，年轻队员们决心尽快接上班。（附图片）
