In the recently concluded World Short Track Speed Skating Championships, the Chinese women's team won one gold medal and two bronze medals. This is the best result achieved by Chinese short track speed skaters in the World Championships since 1983. Guo Hongzhu's victory in the 3,000-meter event ended the 26-year drought for Chinese athletes in winter sports, making it even more inspiring. However, in this competition, our athletes failed to win in some projects where they had high hopes, which is regrettable.

The Chinese team participated in the Sofia Winter Universiade in March and then traveled to Britain for this competition. The athletes' peak competitive period had passed, and factors such as long-distance travel and unsuitable food made it difficult to win medals. However, setting aside these factors, this competition revealed that our athletes lack confidence and have weaknesses in psychological resilience and tactical application in high-level international competitions.

This championship gathered all the top short track speed skaters in the world, with nearly ten athletes in each event capable of winning the gold medal. In such a situation, on-site performance plays a crucial role. Our athletes have few opportunities to compete against world-class athletes, and although they have achieved excellent results domestically, the competition is not as intense. Therefore, when facing intense competition and strong opponents in high-level competitions, they often lack confidence, have restricted thinking, and make unnecessary mistakes. In this competition, our team's poor performance in the 1,500-meter and women's relay events, failing to advance to the finals, fully illustrates this point.

In intense competition, our athletes also exposed immaturity in tactical and technical application, not adapting well to competing against tall European and American athletes, often being pushed into disadvantageous positions. After being squeezed or blocked, the athletes often find it difficult to escape the passive situation, appearing helpless, or falling and committing fouls. In this aspect, athletes from Canada, the Netherlands, and other countries are worth learning from.

In addition to improving their own training, the Chinese short track speed skating team should increase opportunities to compete against world-class athletes in the future, further tempering themselves in intense competitions.

　　从进步中看不足
    ——写在世界短跑道速滑赛之后
    在刚刚结束的世界短跑道速滑锦标赛中，中国女队获得一枚金牌、两枚铜牌。这是自一九八三年以来，我国短跑道速滑选手在世界锦标赛上取得的最好成绩。而郭洪茹夺得三千米金牌，结束了自一九六三年以来我国的冰雪项目中与世界冠军无缘的历史，更令人鼓舞。但是，在这次比赛中，我国选手在一些本来有希望夺魁的项目中名落孙山，不能不说是一个遗憾。
    中国队在三月份参加索非亚冬季大学生运动会之后即挥师英国参加这次比赛，队员的竞技高峰期已过，再加上长途旅行、伙食不适等原因，都给夺取奖牌带来了困难。但是，撇开这些因素，通过这次比赛还暴露出我国选手在高水平世界大赛中存在着信心不足以及心理素质、战术运用等方面的弱点。
    这次锦标赛集中了世界上所有的短跑道速滑高手，可以说每个项目都有十来名选手具备夺取金牌的实力。在这种情况下，临场发挥起着举足轻重的作用。我国选手平时与世界强手交锋的机会不多，尽管在国内创造过一些优秀成绩，但竞争对手不很强，所以，一到竞争激烈、强手如林的高水平比赛，往往在关键时刻显得信心不足，思想放不开，以致造成不应有的失误。在这次比赛中，我队在一千五百米，女子接力等强项中成绩不佳，未能进入决赛，便充分证明了这一点。
    在激烈的对抗中，我国选手也暴露出在战术技术运用方面不够成熟，不太适应同身材高大的欧美选手比赛，往往被对手抢去有利位置。队员们有时被夹、被堵之后，难以摆脱被动局面，显得束手无策，或者摔倒，犯规。在这方面，加拿大、荷兰等国强手值得中国队学习。
    我国短跑道速滑队除了搞好自身训练外，今后还应增加与世界强手交锋的机会，在激烈的比赛中进一步磨练。
