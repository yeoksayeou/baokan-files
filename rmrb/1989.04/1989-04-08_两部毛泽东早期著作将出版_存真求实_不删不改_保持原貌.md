Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, April 7th.

Two collections of Mao Zedong's early works will be published: "Collected Works of Mao Zedong's Early Period" and "Collected Works of Mao Zedong During the Founding of the Party and the Great Revolution Period." These will be published by Hunan People's Publishing House and distributed both domestically and internationally.

These two collections include 283 manuscripts written by Mao Zedong from June 1912 to July 1927. Only two of these have been included in "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," with the majority never having been publicly released.

During the editing process, the editors adhered to the principle of "authenticity and accuracy," including all works regardless of their format, length, or the maturity and correctness of their content. No deletions or changes were made, ensuring the historical authenticity of the works. The editors have written extensive annotations and notes. The total length of the two books is nearly one million words.

The publication of these two collections will correct and clarify many misuses and misinterpretations of Mao Zedong's works from this period both domestically and internationally. They will also provide a comprehensive, systematic, accurate, and reliable set of documentary materials for scholars and the general public to further understand Mao Zedong's life and thoughts, and to study the political and intellectual history of modern China.

    存真求实　不删不改　保持原貌
    新华社长沙４月７日电  由中共中央文献研究室和中共湖南省委毛泽东早期著作编辑组联合编辑的《毛泽东早期著作集》、《建党和大革命时期毛泽东著作集》，将由湖南人民出版社出版，向国内外发行。
    这两部著作集共收录毛泽东自１９１２年６月至１９２７年７月的各种文稿２８３篇。其中已编入《毛泽东选集》的仅２篇，大部分均未公开发表过。
    在编辑过程中，编者本着“存真求实”的原则，不论体裁如何，篇幅长短，思想内容成熟、正确与否，一律收入，不删、不改，努力保持其历史原貌。编者撰写了大量题解和注释。两书总篇幅近百万字。
    这两部著作集的编辑出版，不仅将纠正、澄清国内外对毛泽东这个时期著作的许多误用、讹传，而且为社会科学界和广大读者进一步了解毛泽东的生平及其思想，研究中国近代、现代政治史和思想史，提供了一套全面、系统、准确、可靠和极其珍贵的文献资料。
