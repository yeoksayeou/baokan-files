Title: Sichuan Again Issues IOUs to Farmers

Last autumn and winter, many procurement departments in Sichuan issued IOUs to farmers due to financial constraints, which farmers referred to as "white slips." Later, in accordance with the instructions from the State Council, all white slips held by farmers were converted into cash before the Spring Festival.

This year, starting in February, various places in Sichuan began issuing IOUs again for the procurement of live pigs. By the end of March, the province owed farmers a total of 56 million yuan in pig sales through IOUs. Among them, Chongqing alone issued 110 million yuan in IOUs. The situation in cities like Zizhong, Suining, Guangyuan, and Yibin was also quite severe.

The main reasons for the issuance of IOUs for pig procurement are insufficient bank credit funds and the near-saturation of the pig meat market within and outside the province.

In previous years, Sichuan exported a large amount of pork to other provinces. This year, major pork markets in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other cities reported sufficient pork stocks, leading to blocked sales channels for Sichuan pork.

Last winter and this spring, Sichuan experienced a reduction in sweet potato production, resulting in an insufficient supply of pig feed in the market. Additionally, starting from April 1, the province implemented a policy of reducing the supply of grain by 5 kilograms for each pig sold, which prompted farmers to sell their pigs earlier. Currently, cold storage facilities in various parts of Sichuan are overflowing with pork, and the occupation of funds is at a high level.

Due to the tightening of bank credit, enterprises are facing financial difficulties, and there is severe mutual arrears of goods payments among procurement stations, food companies, and meat processing plants. By the end of March, various meat processing plants in Sichuan owed a total of 1.3 billion yuan to food companies and procurement stations in the production areas; various places outside the province owed Sichuan a total of 1.8 billion yuan for frozen meat. The base-level food companies and procurement stations, whose payments are being delayed, are restricted in obtaining bank loans and have no choice but to issue IOUs to farmers.

The issuance of IOUs has caused widespread dissatisfaction among farmers. In Wusheng, the procurement department owes farmers 18.5 million yuan in pig sales. Daily incidents occur where farmers surround the procurement stations and insult the procurement staff. In some places, farmers seize pork from the meat stalls of food companies, claiming that they are owed money. In other places, farmers sit in the county government offices, demanding that the county magistrate settle the pig payments.

### 四川又向农民打白条

　　四川又向农民打白条
    本报记者  梅洪如
    去年秋冬收购农副产品，四川许多收购部门因资金紧张，向农民打了欠条，农民称之谓“白条”。后来按照国务院的指示，春节前将农民手里的白条全部兑成现金。
    今年２月起，四川各地收购生猪又开始向农民打白条。到３月底，全省以白条形式共欠农民售猪款５６００万元。其中重庆一市打了白条１１００万元。自贡、遂宁、广元、宜宾等市向农民打白条的情况都比较严重。
    银行信贷资金不足和省内外猪肉市场近于饱和，是造成生猪收购打白条的主要原因。
    往年四川向省外大量调出猪肉，今年，北京、上海、天津等一些猪肉大市场都报猪肉库存充足，川肉销路堵塞。
    去冬今春四川红苕减产，市场上猪饲料供应不足。加上４月１日起，全省执行售一头猪少给供应粮５公斤的政策，促使农民提前卖猪。目前川内各地冷冻仓库猪肉暴满为患，资金占用居高不下。
    由于银行紧缩信贷，企业资金紧张，收购站、食品公司、肉类加工厂等单位之间相互拖欠货款十分严重。到３月末，川内各肉联厂共欠产地食品公司、收购站购猪款１．３亿元；省外各地欠四川冻肉款１．８亿元。基层食品公司和收购站货款被拖欠，银行贷款又受到限制，只好向农民打白条。
    白条引起了农民的普遍不满。武胜收购部门欠农民售猪款１８５万元，各地天天发生农民围攻收购站、辱骂收购人员的事。有的地方农民抢食品公司肉摊上的猪肉，理由是欠了他们的款。有的地方农民坐在乡政府不走，要乡长交出猪款来。
