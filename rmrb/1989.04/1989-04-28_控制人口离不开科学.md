    The reporter recently visited the Shanghai Institute of Family Planning Science and reached a conclusion: the hope for controlling the rapid population growth lies in the emphasis on scientific research.

    Professor Gong Yue Ting, the director of the institute, is an old scientist who participated in the work of artificially synthesizing bovine insulin. Two years ago, he was transferred from the Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, to the Shanghai Institute of Family Planning Science. He said, "We cannot treat family planning as merely distributing contraceptives or performing sterilization surgeries. Every measure in family planning requires scientific research to ensure absolute safety. Take contraceptive drugs, for example. Their users are not patients but healthy men and women, so they must be safe, effective, affordable, and convenient to use. Otherwise, people will hesitate to use them. The development of contraceptive drugs must undergo absolutely reliable animal trials and preliminary human trials." He developed the "gonadotropin-releasing hormone" injection, which was first tested on himself. Now, three factories are producing it.

    The Shanghai Institute of Family Planning Science is the first comprehensive family planning research institution in the country and also a cooperative center for human reproduction research of the World Health Organization. Gong Yue Ting is the center director. The institute has six research fellows, and five experts have been appointed as consultants to the WHO expert committee. In the national family planning science and technology research "Sixth Five-Year Plan" key projects, the institute undertook and participated in six projects, all of which won awards, and two other projects won ministry-level science and technology progress awards. They also synthesized a new type of anti-pregnancy drug. Women in the early stages of pregnancy can take this drug for a short period, which will result in a spontaneous abortion. The institute has 31 young and middle-aged scholars who have been trained or visited abroad, and many have become leaders in their fields.

    Deputy Director Zhao Bai Ge led the reporter to visit the experimental building and the newly built animal experimental room. We saw many advanced instruments and equipment funded by the World Health Organization, as well as 110 kinds of original foreign-language journals provided by the organization. The three imported strains of white mice have started to reproduce offspring, supplying other research units in the country. The animal room operates under the supervision of a foreign expert with very strict requirements and high efficiency. Experts believe that such a good animal experimental room is rare in the country. Zhao Bai Ge introduced: They conduct pathological and toxicological tests for domestically produced contraceptive drugs, provide technical information to 150 units nationwide free of charge, and more than 500 scientific and technological personnel from across the country have participated in training activities organized by the institute.

　　控制人口离不开科学
    本报记者  萧关根
    记者日前访问了上海市计划生育科学研究所，得出一个结论：控制人口增长过快的希望还在于重视科学研究。
    所长龚岳亭教授是位老科学家，参加过人工合成牛胰岛素的工作。两年前从中国科学院上海生化所调到计划生育科学研究所。他说，不能把计划生育当作只是发发避孕药具、做做节育手术的低层次工作。计划生育的每一项措施都需要进行科学研究，做到万无一失。拿避孕药物来说，它的服务对象并不是病人，而是健康的男男女女，所以必须做到安全高效、价廉物美、使用方便。不然，人们使用时会产生顾虑。避孕药的研制一定要做绝对可靠的纯种动物试验，还要在人身上作预先试验。他研制的“促性激素释放激素”针剂就首先在自己身上做了试验，现在已有３家工厂生产。
    上海市计划生育科学研究所是国内第一个综合性的计划生育研究机构，又是世界卫生组织人类生殖研究合作中心，龚岳亭是中心主任。所里有６位研究员，５名专家被聘为世界卫生组织专题委员会顾问，国家计划生育科研“六五”攻关计划中，这个所承担和参加的６个课题都获了奖，另有两个课题获部委科技进步奖。他们还合成了一种新型的抗早孕药。妇女怀孕初期只要在短期内服用此药，即会自动流产。全所还有３１名中青年学者到国外培训或考察，不少人成为学科带头人。
    赵白鸽副所长带着记者参观了实验大楼和新建的实验动物房。我们看到不少先进的仪器设备是世界卫生组织资助的，１１０种原版外文期刊也是这个组织提供的。引进的３种纯种白鼠已经开始繁殖后代，供给国内其他研究单位。动物房在一位外国专家主持下工作。要求十分严格，效率很高。行家认为，这样好的实验动物房国内尚不多见。赵白鸽介绍说：他们要为国内生产的避孕药进行病理毒理检测，向全国１５０个单位无偿提供科技信息，国内有５００多名科技人员参加过该所组办的培训活动。
