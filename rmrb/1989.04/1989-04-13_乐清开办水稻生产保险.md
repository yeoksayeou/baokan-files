The first rice production insurance service in China began operations on April 4 in Yucheng County, Zhejiang Province. This insurance is a joint initiative by the Yucheng County Insurance Company and the County Agricultural Technology Station aimed at promoting grain production and alleviating the concerns of grain production specialists. The insurance policy stipulates that all rice crops cultivated by grain production specialists in the county, with normal management, are eligible for insurance. During the insurance period, if the average yield per mu (a unit of area) does not reach the insured yield due to natural disasters such as drought, flooding, wind, or hail, compensation ranging from 50% to 100% of the total insured amount will be provided based on the extent of the damage.
