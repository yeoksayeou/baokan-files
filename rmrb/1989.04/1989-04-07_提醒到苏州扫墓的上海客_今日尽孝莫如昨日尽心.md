	Reminder to Shanghai Visitors to Suzhou for Tomb-Sweeping
	Today's Filial Piety is Better Than Yesterday's Sincerity

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 6 (Reporter Guo Lingchun) Under the drizzling rain of the Qingming Festival, thousands of vehicles from Jiangnan bring visitors to the outskirts of Suzhou to pay their respects to their ancestors. Shanghai residents, dressed in fashionable attire, carry cakes and incense, and the ancient custom of respecting the elderly seems to have returned in this moment.

	In the cemetery area, as soon as the visitors leave, vendors selling incense and candles come to "clean up." It is understood that the cemetery area has substantial income, and every year, Shanghai residents coming here have increased interactions with the locals. This layer of relationship radiating from underground is called the "spirit effect."

	In recent years, the tomb-sweeping activity in Jiangnan has seen a resurgence, attracting much public debate. Some say that paying respects to the deceased is commendable. However, in Shanghai's streets and alleys, the current trend is mostly "respecting the young over the old." Today's filial piety is better than yesterday's sincerity. If the people paying their respects have such descendants, they might as well think about it at the tomb: if the ancestors were alive, they could have shown a bit of affection. Even if they did not suffer the hardship of this journey today, they could still comfort the spirits of the deceased.

　　提醒到苏州扫墓的上海客
    今日尽孝莫如昨日尽心
    据新华社上海四月六日电  （记者郭玲春）细雨霏霏的清明时节，每天数以千计的车辆载着江南客来到姑苏城外祭奠先人。穿着时髦的上海人提着糕团香烛，尊老的古风似乎在这一刻又悄然而至。
    公墓区，扫墓者刚刚离去，便有卖香烛的来“拾掇”。据了解，墓区收入不薄，而且上海人每年来此，与当地人增进了来往，这层由地下“辐射”开去的关系，被称作“亡灵效应”。
    在江南，近年又见长势的清明扫墓活动，引来舆论纷纷。有人说，为亡者祭，诚心可嘉。只是上海大街小巷，目前的风气大多是“老敬少”。有今日尽孝，莫如昨日尽心。祭奠的人群倘有这样的儿孙，在墓前他不妨想一想，如果先人在世时，便能尽一份情意，即使今天不受这份跋涉之苦，也可告慰地下的亡灵。
