The discovery of industrial gas flows in deep exploration wells in the Daqing Oilfield has confirmed the predictions of petroleum geologists that this oilfield holds rich natural gas resources. This year, deep exploration in the Daqing Oilfield is expected to control 5 billion cubic meters of natural gas.

In October last year, oil layers were found in the upper part, gas layers in the middle, and gas-bearing coal layers in the lower part of the 4506-meter-deep "Zhaosheng Five Well." Experts say that this well is expected to yield even larger industrial natural gas flows.

It is understood that the deep layers of Daqing have good geological conditions for the generation and storage of natural gas. This area is a huge treasure trove with an estimated natural gas reserve of about 100 billion cubic meters.

　　大庆油田深层处蕴藏大量天然气
    据新华社哈尔滨４月３日电  （通讯员魏国志）随着大庆油田深层探井出现工业气流，石油地质专家对这个油田深层蕴藏着丰富天然气资源的预测得到了证实。为此，今年大庆油田的深层勘探预计可控制５０亿立方米天然气。
    去年１０月，在４５０６米深的“肇深五井”上部发现油层，中部发现气层，下部发现含气煤层。据专家介绍，这口井可望获得更大的工业天然气流。
    据了解，大庆的深层具有良好的天然气生成和储藏地质条件，这里是个蕴藏量约１０００亿立方米天然气的巨大宝库。
