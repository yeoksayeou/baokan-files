Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 15th.

According to TASS, Shevardnadze, who was dispatched by the CPSU Politburo to handle the bloody events in Tbilisi, criticized the Georgian Republic's party organization for its inability to analyze and judge the situation at the Georgian Communist Party Central Committee plenum held on April 14.

He also criticized the party organization for not paying attention to maintaining a balance of various social interests, gradually losing some of its combativeness. He said that when a rift appeared between the party-government leadership and part of the residents, neither side showed restraint, and they did not know how to conduct a dialogue like partners. Therefore, the party ultimately lost control of the situation and encountered unexpected circumstances.

He said that under conditions of democratization, party leaders have to frequently deal with those who raise objections. These people can become dialogue partners, and at the very least, one should talk to them and listen to their ideas.

When discussing ethnic relations, he hoped that the attendees would respect reality, respect the traditions of multi-ethnic interactions over several centuries, and the friendly traditions between the Georgian and Russian peoples.

Shevardnadze said that if the lives of Tbilisi's residents return to normal, the military will withdraw on April 17.

　　批评党组织不善于分析形势
    新华社莫斯科４月１５日电　据塔斯社报道，由苏共中央政治局派遣、一直在第比利斯处理流血事件的谢瓦尔德纳泽，在１４日举行的格鲁吉亚共产党中央全会上批评了格鲁吉亚共和国党组织不善于分析和判断形势。
    他还批评党组织不注意使各种社会利益保持平衡，渐渐地失去了自己的某些战斗性。他说，在党政领导和部分居民之间出现了隔阂时，双方没有表现出克制的态度，不会像伙伴那样进行对话。因此，党最终失去了对局势的控制，遇到了没料到的情况。
    他说，在民主化的条件下，党的领导干部不得不经常同提出反对意见的人打交道。这些人可以成为对话者，至少要同他们交谈，听听他们的想法。
    在谈到民族关系时，他希望与会者尊重现实，尊重几个世纪以来多民族交往的传统，以及格鲁吉亚族人和俄罗斯族人之间的友好传统。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽说，如果第比利斯市的居民生活转入正常，军队４月１７日将撤离。
