Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 13th.

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Jin Guihua today said that Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach recently proposed six measures to prevent the Khmer Rouge from returning to power, which contradicts Vietnam's repeated advocacy of "national reconciliation" and is intended to mislead.

Jin Guihua, in an afternoon press conference, responded to related questions by saying, "If Vietnam truly wants to prevent the Khmer Rouge from returning to power, it should support the establishment of a four-party interim coalition government led by Prince Sihanouk after the withdrawal of troops, agree to reduce the armed forces of all Cambodian factions to a low level, and agree to the deployment of an international peacekeeping force in Cambodia for strict and effective international supervision."

He pointed out that Vietnam has opposed all of these measures. "This can only indicate that Nguyen Co Thach's actions are yet another attempt to let the Heng Samrin-Hun Sen faction rule alone, or to make the Heng-Sen faction the main force in the future government of Cambodia. This will not work."

Jin Guihua reiterated that China's position is to oppose any one side ruling alone and to oppose excluding any one side. It is not acceptable for the Khmer Rouge to rule alone, nor can it be acknowledged that Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia is a fait accompli, allowing the Heng-Sen faction to rule alone.

In response to questions about Prince Sihanouk and Hun Sen's upcoming meeting in Jakarta, Jin Guihua said, "China respects Prince Sihanouk's efforts for a fair and reasonable resolution to the Cambodian issue."

He also expressed support for Prince Sihanouk's new proposal to convene an international conference to guide the reconciliation of all Cambodian factions. He said, "To comprehensively, fairly, and reasonably resolve the Cambodian issue, China supports the convening of an international conference and hopes that the United Nations mechanism will play a greater role."

Jin Guihua also mentioned in response to a reporter's question that the date for the second round of deputy foreign minister-level consultations between China and Vietnam has not yet been determined.

### 外交部发言人指出　阮基石六条措施别有用心　企图让韩桑林洪森一派单独掌权

　　外交部发言人指出
　　阮基石六条措施别有用心
　　企图让韩桑林洪森一派单独掌权
    新华社北京４月１３日电　外交部发言人金桂华今天说，越南外交部长阮基石最近提出防止红色高棉重新上台的６条措施，与越南一再宣扬的“民族和解”精神背道而驰，是别有用心的。
    金桂华在下午的新闻发布会上回答有关问题时说，如果真要防止红色高棉重新上台，越南就应赞成撤军后在柬埔寨成立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府，同意柬埔寨各派武装力量都减少到低水平，同意派国际维持和平部队进驻柬埔寨，进行严格有效的国际监督。
    他指出，越南对这些都一概反对。“这只能表明，阮基石此举不过是又一次企图让韩桑林—洪林一派单独掌权，或在柬埔寨未来政府中以韩、洪派为主。这都是行不通的。”
    金桂华重申，中国的立场是，反对任何一方独家掌权，也反对排斥任何一方，既不能让红色高棉单独掌权，也决不能承认越南侵柬的既成事实，让韩、洪派单独掌权。
    在回答有关西哈努克亲王和洪森将在雅加达会晤的问题时，金桂华说，中国尊重西哈努克亲王为公正、合理解决柬埔寨问题所做的努力。
    他还表示赞成西哈努克亲王关于召开一次国际会议，以指导柬埔寨各方和解的新建议。他说，为全面、公正、合理地解决柬埔寨问题，中国赞成召开国际会议，并希望联合国机制发挥更多的作用。
    金桂华在回答记者提问时还说，中越第二轮副外长磋商的日期尚未确定。
