Representatives of the middle and young generation gather in Beijing to discuss the theory and practice of reform over the past decade
Hu Qili: Reform needs theoretical support

A reporter from this newspaper reported from Beijing on April 4: Party and state leaders Hu Qili, Tian Jiyun, Li Tieying, and Song Renqiong, along with responsible comrades from relevant departments of the Central Committee, met with representatives of the "Ten Years of Reform: Middle and Young Generation Theory and Practice Seminar" and took a group photo with them. As they were leaving, Comrade Hu Qili said to the representatives, "Reform needs theoretical support. We hope everyone will put forward various constructive opinions, and we will seriously listen to all kinds of voices."

The seminar, which opened in Beijing on April 2, was unprecedented in scale, with more than 400 representatives present. In the spirit of "seeking truth, innovating, being democratic, and united," they calmly analyzed the various challenges they faced and actively explored strategies to get out of the predicament, demonstrating the vitality and strength of the middle and young generation of theoretical workers.

Most representatives believe that as the reform deepens, China has undergone significant changes in various aspects over the past ten years, but many hidden internal problems have also emerged, hindering the continued advancement of reform practices. In particular, the deterioration of the economic environment over the past year has caused many people, including reformers, to doubt the reform practice. At this critical juncture, a review and reflection on the ten years of reform, a serious summary of experiences and lessons, is necessary and beneficial for firming up reform confidence, uniting the team, and overcoming difficulties together.

This seminar was jointly organized by several dozen units, including the All-China Youth Federation, Beijing Youth Economics Association, China Youth Socialist Reform Research Association, and China Economic System Reform Research Institute.

　　中青年代表在北京聚会研讨改革十年理论实践
    胡启立说改革需要理论支持
    本报北京４月４日讯  记者孟晓云报道：党和国家领导人胡启立、田纪云、李铁映、宋任穷和中央有关部委的负责同志，今天会见了“改革十年：中青年理论与实践研讨会”的代表并与他们合影留念。临走时，胡启立同志对代表们说：“改革需要理论支持，希望大家提出各种建设性意见，我们会认真地听取各种声音。”
    ４月２日在京开幕的这次研讨会盛况空前，４００多名代表本着“求实、创新、民主、团结”的精神，冷静分析面临的各种挑战，积极探索走出困境的对策，显示出中青年理论工作者的活力与实力。
    大多数代表认为，随着改革的深入，十年来中国在各方面发生重大变化的同时，出现了许多过去隐蔽的内在性问题，困扰着改革实践的继续推进。尤其是去年以来出现的经济环境恶化情况，使相当一部分群众甚至改革者对改革实践产生了怀疑。在此关键时刻，通过对改革十年的回顾与反思，认真总结经验教训，对坚定改革信心，团结队伍，共度难关是十分必要和有益的。
    这次研讨会是由全国青联、北京青年经济学会、中国青年社会主义改革研究会、中国经济体制改革研究所等几十家单位主办的。
