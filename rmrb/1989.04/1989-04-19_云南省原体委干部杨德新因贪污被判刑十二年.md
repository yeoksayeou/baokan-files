Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, April 17th.

Former head of the training team of the Yunnan Provincial Sports Commission, Yang Dexin, was recently sentenced to 12 years in prison by the Kunming Intermediate People's Court for embezzling 14,000 yuan in cash and 27,000 yuan worth of public property.

It is reported that from March 1984 to February 1987, Yang Dexin took advantage of his position, using opportunities to purchase public property and handle public funds, to embezzle by underreporting the quantity of goods received, inflating invoice amounts, hiding lists and goods, and even stealing bonuses and nutritional allowances from coaches and athletes.

After the Kunming Intermediate People's Court handed down its verdict, Yang Dexin appealed. The Yunnan Provincial Higher People's Court made a final ruling: dismiss the appeal and uphold the original verdict.
