Title: A Night in Miaolan

In Guizhou's Rongjiang County, I proposed to the county's Ethnic Affairs Commission's Old Yang that we visit the poorest village among the Dong people. Old Yang suggested, "Let's go to Miaolan. It's so remote that I've never even been there myself."

The county seat is connected to Zaima Township, where Miaolan is located, by a paved road. The dirt and stone road winds through steep mountains, and below, a deep gorge is said to be the site where Zhuge Liang burned the bamboo-armored troops of Meng Huo. From Zaima to Miaolan, we had to rely on our own two feet. We climbed for over three hours on a narrow mountain path that could only accommodate one person, sweating profusely, until it grew dark and we finally saw the wispy smoke from cooking fires: Miaolan was in sight.

Before entering the village, we heard a rhythmic "thump, thump" sound. This was the sound of girls pounding rice for dinner. I had seen a bronze model of this foot-operated wooden pestle and stone mortar in a documentary about ancient tombs in Guizhou. The girls wore long-sleeved green cotton shirts, colorful wide sashes around their waists, and wrapped their legs with cloth, with red and green ribbons tied above the cloth. The men wore green headscarves, short and baggy shirts, and wide-legged pants—it was a pure and authentic Dong village scene.

Miaolan is poor; all 117 households in the village have 20% food shortages. The rest of the households just manage to get by. The per capita income is 180 yuan, of which only 50 yuan is in cash. The Dong custom is that even the poorest village must have a drum tower. Miaolan's drum tower now only has a roof left.

That night, we sat around the fireplace in the home of the village head, Yang Guozhong, chatting with a few Dong villagers. The village head is illiterate, simple and quiet, and insisted on holding the kerosene lamp to light the way for me, refusing to put it down even when asked.

If electricity and roads are the two tracks on which the train of modern civilization runs, then Miaolan's poverty is due to the lack of these two tracks. In 1979, the village borrowed and raised 130,000 yuan to build a small hydroelectric power station, but due to the lack of technical personnel, it broke down after just one year. To repair it, another 100,000 yuan is needed, but the village not only has no public welfare funds, it still owes 20,000 yuan in loans. Everyone said, "Without electricity, we have to pound rice for meals and can't process large amounts of pig feed to develop pig farming. Without electricity, radios and televisions can't be used, and outside culture can't come in." From the village to the county seat, even taking the shortest route, one has to walk 70 li of mountain roads. The Dong people only go down the mountain when necessary to exchange eggs and charcoal for oil, salt, and cloth in the township. Going to the county seat is like "seeing the world."

"Water makes people open, mountains make people closed." The closed environment severely restricts the ability of the highland Dong people to accept new things. Miaolan only grows one crop of rice and does not believe in "outsider rice seeds" (hybrid rice). In recent years, under the semi-compulsory promotion of the district and township, they have started growing hybrid rice and added a crop of rapeseed, but they still do not grow wheat. Miaolan is surrounded by mountains, but people only know how to cut firewood and make charcoal, and have no other ideas for using the mountains. To the point where people have not become rich, but the mountains have become fewer. Once, 130 mu of hillside land was leased to outsiders for 12 years, with a total leasing fee of only 400 yuan. The outsiders used the hillside land to plant trees and grow mushrooms, and quickly saw results. But Miaolan used the 400 yuan to buy a few costumes and performed a play once a year during the Spring Festival.

When it comes to medicine and health, the people here "believe in both medicine and ghosts." If medical treatment is not effective, they seek help from ghosts, and if seeking help from ghosts is not effective, they seek medical treatment again. The village originally had an old ghost doctor who died, and now they have to go to neighboring villages to "introduce" ghosts.

Where is the way out for Miaolan? We discussed this by the fireside. The general consensus was that in addition to popularizing high-yield varieties and increasing the number of crops grown, they should make use of the mountainous terrain to accelerate the development of forestry. Since 1985, Miaolan has begun to restore the forest land destroyed during the Cultural Revolution, and has now planted 2,000 mu of Chinese fir. However, the growth cycle of timber forests is long, and the accompanying township head suggested that they should not wait for the Chinese fir to mature, but can make use of the good climate here to plant fruit trees and grapes, combining the long-term benefits of forestry with short-term benefits.

Old Yang from the Ethnic Affairs Commission said: The problem of electricity, the county has already prepared to send people to help, but the road construction due to lack of funds, the difficulty is too great. Only after the fir forest is mature, the forestry department will come to build the road. What can be done now is to widen and repair the existing mountain roads to facilitate the villagers' comings and goings.

We have also been to many Dong villages that have begun to prosper. Like the neighboring Zhongbao Township, due to its flat terrain, it has developed watermelons in recent years, and the per capita net income has exceeded 400 yuan. In comparison, villages like Miaolan, which are constrained by the objective environment and lagging behind, should receive more attention and support from the government and society.

Although Miaolan is poor, like all Dong villages, it is warm and hospitable and pays attention to etiquette. The Dong people entertain guests with glutinous rice. Although the village has little glutinous rice, the host family eats coarse rice but piles large balls of glutinous rice and large pieces of red pickled fish into our bowls. When we were about to leave, the village head's family wrapped a large bowl of fried eggs with newly steamed glutinous rice balls, and tied it up with clean straw, insisting that we take it with us: "The Dong custom is that guests should not go hungry on the road!" The village head, fearing that we might not recognize the way, carried a load of 50-60 jin of charcoal and accompanied us down the mountain to the roadside.

When I climbed up the hill next to the village, I couldn't help but turn around and take a deep, affectionate look at the Dong village shrouded in the morning fog: "Miaolan's fellow villagers, hurry up and get rich!"

　　苗兰一夜
    本报记者　朱维群
    在贵州榕江县，我向县民委老杨提出采访侗族中最穷的寨子。老杨说：“我们去苗兰吧，那里太僻远，连我也没去过哩。”
    县城同苗兰所在的栽麻乡通公路。土石路面在险峻的大山上盘旋，山下深峡相传就是诸葛亮火烧孟获藤甲兵的地方。从栽麻到苗兰可就全凭腿上功夫了。我们在只容一人的山路上攀登３个多小时，大汗淋漓，直到天暗下来，才望见山背后袅袅炊烟：苗兰到了。
    人未进寨，先听到一片此起彼伏的“咚咚”声。那是各家的女孩子在舂米做晚饭。这种用脚踩的木杵和石臼，不久前我在一部介绍贵州古代墓葬文物的纪录片中见地它的铜制模型。女孩子们身穿大襟青布衫，腰束彩色宽布带，裹绑腿，绑腿上端系着细细的红绿两根带子；男子们青布包头，短而肥的上衫，大裤脚——简直是一幅纯真的侗家风情画。
    苗兰穷，全寨１１７户，有２０％缺粮。其他户也是刚刚够吃而已。人均总收入１８０元，其中现金不过５０元。侗族习惯，寨子再穷也要有座鼓楼。苗兰的鼓楼现在就剩一个顶了。
    晚上，我们和几位侗胞围坐在村长杨国忠家的火塘边聊天。村长不识字，憨厚寡语，坚持举着煤油灯为我记录照明，请他放下也不肯。
    如果说电和路是现代文明列车赖以前进的两根轨道，那么苗兰的穷首先就在缺这两根轨。１９７９年寨子曾贷款、集资１．３万元修了个小水电站，由于没有技术人员，仅一年就弄坏了。再修还得１万元，可寨子里不仅没有一分钱公益金，还有２０００元贷款至今没还。大家说：“没有电，吃饭靠舂米，也不能大量加工猪饲料来发展养猪业。没有电，收音机、电视机都用不上，外面的文化也进不来。”从寨子到县城，抄近路也得走７０里山路。侗胞们除了不得已要拿鸡蛋、木炭到乡里换点油、盐、布，轻易不下山，到县城就算是“看世界”了。
    “水使人通，山使人壅”。封闭的环境严重限制了高坡侗家接受新事物的能力。苗兰只种一季稻，又不相信“客家稻种”（杂交稻）。近年在区乡半强制推广下才种上杂交稻，加种一季油菜，而麦子至今不种。苗兰四面皆山，但人们除了砍柴烧炭，想不出其他利用办法。以至人没富起来，山林却少下去。有一回曾将１３０亩坡地一次性转让给外乡人使用１２年，全部转让费仅４００元。外乡人利用坡地植树养香菇，很快就见到成效。而苗兰却将这４００元买了几件戏装，每年春节穿出来唱一次戏。
    说到医药卫生，这里的人“医鬼兼信”。求医不成就求鬼，求鬼不灵又求医。本寨原有一位老鬼师死了，现在求鬼也要到邻近寨子“引进”。
    苗兰出路在哪里，我们在火塘边你一句我一句地议论。比较一致的看法是，除种植业要普及良种、提高复种指数外，应利用多山的特点，加快发展林业。从１９８５年起，苗兰已开始恢复在“文革”中被毁掉的林地，现已种杉木２０００亩。但是用材林生长周期长，同来的乡长建议他们不要坐等杉木成材，可以利用这里良好的气候条件，种果木、种葡萄，将林业的长期效益和近期效益结合起来。
    民委老杨说：电的问题，县里已准备来人帮助，但修路由于缺少缺资金，难度太大。只有等杉林成材后，由林业部门来修路。现在可以做的是拓宽、整修现有山路，方便寨民进出。
    我们也曾到过不少开始富裕的侗家寨子。像邻近县城的中宝乡，由于地势平坦，近几年又发展起西瓜，人均纯收入已超过４００元相比之下，像苗兰这样受客观环境束缚而落后的山区寨子，应当得到政府与社会更多的关注和支持。
    苗兰虽穷，可是同所有侗家寨子一样热情好客、注重礼仪。侗家待客讲究用糯米，寨子里糯米不足，主人全家吃糙米，却把大团糯米饭和大块红红的腌鱼堆到我们碗里。我们告辞之际，村长家又用新蒸的糯米团包了一大碗炒鸡蛋，外面再用干净稻草捆扎起来，非要我们带上不可：“侗家的规矩，客人在路上也不能饿着！”村长怕我们不识路，挑上五六十斤一担木炭，一直送我们下山到公路边。
    当我走上寨子旁的高坡时，不禁回头又深情地望一眼晨雾笼罩下的侗寨：“苗兰的乡亲们，快快富起来吧。”（附图片）
