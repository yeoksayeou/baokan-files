Qin Hui, who framed Yue Fei, is despised by the people of Hangzhou. The local people call fried dough sticks "oil-fried Qin Hui," symbolizing the intertwined fate of Qin Hui and his wife, fried and eaten, showing their deep hatred for the couple.

I recently read Zheng Zhenqiu's "Gōu Lóu Jí," which discusses Qin Hui's merits and quotes Ming Dynasty scholar Wang Shào's "Zhèn Zé Jì Wén": "Qiu Xun, a native of Qiongzhou, was well-versed in state affairs and particularly knowledgeable about national history. His discussions were often unique and aimed at correcting societal norms. He said of Qin Hui: 'The Song Dynasty had to make peace with the Jin at this point. The restoration of the Southern Song was due to Qin Hui's efforts.'"

Qiu Xun was a renowned scholar in the early Ming Dynasty, known for his extensive learning and late-life dedication despite losing an eye. He was known for his straightforward character and impartial views. How could he have praised Qin Hui so highly?

I have read Qiu's poems "Yue Wang Fen" and "Tie Yue Wang Miao," finding them well-written and comparable to Wen Zhengming's famous "Laugh at the small Qin Hui, what could he do?" from the "Man Jiang Hong" poem.

Qiu's "Yue Wang Fen" is sharp and biting:
"I heard of Yue Fei's tomb on the West Lake, even now the branches point south.
Grass and trees still know how to honor a loyal minister, but the king honors a treacherous official!
Who is the close relative serving wine? Ten years of bloodshed for whom?
Loyalty is turned into slaughter, the barbarians could not destroy Qin.
Alas, Minister Fei died, Minister Jun was happy, Minister Xun has no words, the world is without loyalty;
Qin Hui's letter reported to the fourth prince at night, the minister bowed twice from then on!"

Qiu's "Tie Yue Wang Miao" ("Qin Yuan Chun") is even more tragic and heart-wrenching:
"For the country, eliminate loyalty; for the enemy, avenge the grudge, it is hateful and pitiful!
Looking at the world at that time, whose realm was it? Where are the king and parents? How many talents?
In the midst of certain death, ten years of bloodshed, what was the point of all this?
Why bother to destroy the Great Wall and secretly undermine the pillars? Although heaven's justice is vast,
It cannot turn back the will of the people. Sigh, in the Yellow Dragon Palace, the celebration has not yet begun,
On the Zhu Xian Ridge, the memorial tablet is already there. Together, they wear the enemy's hat, willingly entering the land of death,
Where is the justice of heaven and the conscience of the people? The hero's resentment, towards the ten thousand years and a thousand generations,
Will never be buried!"

From these poems, it is clear that Qiu deeply admires and sympathizes with Yue Fei's military achievements and unjust death. He strongly condemns Qin Hui and even the Song Emperor Gaozong's sins. Therefore, it seems impossible that Qiu would have praised Qin Hui's merits. Wang Shào was born 32 years after Qiu, so the credibility of this "Jì Wén" is questionable.

### 岳飞墓庙诗话

　　岳飞墓庙诗话
    史莽
    陷害岳飞的秦桧，在杭州人心目中是不齿于人的。人们吃的油条，相传杭州人叫“油炸桧”，两根面条子绞在一起，象征秦桧夫妇，油炸而啖食，可见对其夫妇痛恨之深。
    偶阅郑振铎的《佝偻集》，讲到秦桧之功，引用了明朝王鏊的《震泽纪闻》：“丘浚，琼州人，问学该洽，尤熟于国家典故。议论多奇，务于矫俗。……论秦桧曰：‘宋家至是亦不得不与金和。南宋再造，桧之力也’”。
    丘浚是明朝初期人，多才好学出名，晚年右目失明，还披览不辍，时人称他性格介直，持论公正，怎么会为秦桧摆好评功呢？
    我读过丘氏的《岳王坟》诗、《题岳王庙》词，觉得写得很好，至少可与受人传诵的文征明的“笑区区一桧亦何能，逄其欲”——《满江红》词可以媲美。
    丘氏的《岳王坟》诗，写得尖锐辛辣：“我闻岳王之坟西湖上，至今树枝尚南向。草木犹知表荩臣，君王乃尔崇奸相！青衣行酒谁家亲？十年血战为谁人？忠勋翻见遭杀戮，胡人未必能亡秦。呜呼，臣飞死，臣俊喜，臣浚无言世忠靡；桧书夜报四太子，臣构再拜从此始！”
    丘氏的《题岳王庙》词（《沁园春》），更写得悲怆痛切：“为国除忠，为敌报仇，可恨堪哀！顾当时乾坤，是谁境界？君亲何处？几许人才？万死间关，十年血战，端的孜孜为甚来？何须苦把长城自坏，柱石潜摧！虽然天道恢恢，奈人众将天钧转回。叹黄龙府里，未行贺酒，朱仙镇上，先奉追牌。共戴仇天，甘投死地，天理人心安在哉！英雄恨，向万年千载，永不沉埋！”
    从丘氏的这些诗词来看，他对岳飞的战功和冤死，深表赞许和同情；对秦桧、甚至宋帝赵构的罪孽，谴责得十分有力。因此，认定丘浚发议论为秦桧摆好评功，似不可能。王鏊比丘氏晚生三十二年，他的这则“纪闻”是否可信，值得怀疑。
