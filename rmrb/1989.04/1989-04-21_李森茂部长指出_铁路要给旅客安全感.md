Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, April 21st.

Minister Li Senmao of the Ministry of Railways emphasized at the national railway transportation safety on-site conference that all levels of railway leadership must firmly establish a safety consciousness and work diligently to ensure railway transportation safety.

Since several major and serious accidents occurred on the railways at the beginning of last year, railway workers have seriously learned from these lessons, strictly adhered to regulations, and ensured transportation safety. Last year, train accidents decreased by 7.6% compared to 1987, and dangerous incidents decreased by 24.5%. All railway bureaus and sub-bureaus achieved more than 100 days without major or serious train accidents. In the first quarter of this year, major and serious train accidents decreased by 30% compared to the same period last year, and dangerous incidents decreased by 12.8%. During the Spring Festival travel period, there were no passenger fatality accidents.

Li Senmao pointed out that railway transportation safety not only affects the reputation of the railways but also the credibility of the country. If railways frequently experience serious accidents, causing people to lose their sense of security, it will lead to social instability. He urged all railway workers to continue their efforts and do an even better job in safety work.

The on-site conference was held at the Linfen Railway Sub-bureau, which has achieved a record of 3,000 days of safe train operations.

　　李森茂部长指出    
    铁路要给旅客安全感
    据新华社太原４月２１日电（记者李玫）铁道部部长李森茂在全国铁路运输安全现场会议上要求全路各级领导牢固树立安全意识、真抓实干，确保铁路运输安全。
    自去年年初铁路发生几起重大恶性事故以后，铁路职工认真吸取教训，严格规章制度，确保运输安全。去年行车事故比１９８７年减少７．６％，险性事故减少２４．５％，各铁路局及分局全部实现百日以上无责任行车重大、大事故。今年第一季度行车重大、大事故比去年同期减少３０％，险性事故减少１２．８％；春运期间没有发生一起旅客死亡事故。
    李森茂指出，铁路运输安全不仅关系到铁路的声誉，而且关系到国家的信誉。如果铁路老是发生恶性事故，使人们失去安全感，将造成社会的不安定。他要求全路职工再接再厉，把安全工作搞得更好。
    现场会在创造安全行车３０００天纪录的临汾铁路分局召开。
