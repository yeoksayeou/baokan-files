Gap, Crisis, Hope

Observations on the Men's Team Final at the World Table Tennis Championships

Famous Go player Nie Weiping, after losing to Japanese Go player Hane Yoshio, said: "I knew this day would come." Similarly, the defeat of the Chinese men's table tennis team, which people had long anticipated, finally became a stark reality last night. What was hard to accept was the 0:5 crushing defeat that cost them the Swaythling Cup.

Insufficient Personnel

West German table tennis star Jörg Roßkopf commented on the Chinese men's team's defeat, saying: "From the moment I saw the list of players for the Chinese team, I knew they had nothing new." Roßkopf's words were correct. In previous team finals, the Chinese men's team always had new faces, each time with new features, surprising their opponents. The 36th World Championships had Xie Saike and Cai Zhenhua, the 37th had Jiang Jialiang, the 38th had Chen Xinhua and Chen Longcan, and the 39th had Teng Yi.

This time, in the 40th World Championships final, the Chinese team's lineup, tactics, and personnel were exactly the same as two years ago. When submitting the team list for the tournament, Coach Xu Shaofa gritted his teeth and included two new players, Ma Wenqing and Yu Shentong, hoping they could be the "dark horse" and the "prodigy." Unfortunately, the two young players were not up to the task, lacking both strength and unique features. They couldn't even defeat relatively weaker opponents in the preliminary rounds, so how could they be used in the final?

Loss of Tactical Advantage

The three veteran players of the Chinese team fought hard in the tense final atmosphere, giving their all. If they had handled a few crucial balls better, the situation might have changed. However, the primary reason for the Chinese team's failure was their technical inferiority and the suppression of their strengths. Serving, serving attacks, and taking the initiative in the first three exchanges—these were the Chinese team's winning strategies in the past, but they didn't work last night. Instead, the Swedish team had the upper hand in serving quality.

Chinese players who use the fast-attack style near the table lost their advantage in the first three exchanges. Their technique in prolonged rallies was also clearly inferior to their opponents, making it no surprise that they were at a disadvantage. Swedish coach Kjell Johansson said at the post-match press conference: "For so many years, the Chinese team has always used the same tactics. I don't understand why the Chinese don't change."

When Will the Crown Be Reclaimed?

Li Fuhong, who is never willing to admit defeat, said something thought-provoking after the final: "I think it will take the Chinese team two or three championships (four to six years) to reclaim the Swaythling Cup."

In 1979, after the Chinese men's team lost the world championship, a group of young, energetic newcomers quickly stepped up, so it only took two years to regain the advantage. Currently, the concern among Chinese table tennis experts is the lack of outstanding young talents like those from back then.

In addition, there is an even more worrying problem. A few days before the men's team final, Chinese team coach Xu Shaofa half-jokingly, half-seriously said: "The head coach position is thankless and demanding. I've done enough, and I can't continue." In fact, many famous athletes also do not want to continue, preferring to retire early and go abroad to earn money playing.

Lacking new players can be remedied. With the strong foundation of Chinese table tennis built over several decades, it is not difficult to nurture a few outstanding players. However, if the team's morale is shaken and even the coaches have no heart to continue, this crisis is more frightening.

However, based on past experiences, there is reason to believe that as long as the Chinese table tennis community has a strong, united leadership core, and works hard for a few years, the current low tide of the Chinese men's team can be overcome quickly, and the dawn is not far away.

### 差距·危机·希望——世乒赛男子团体决赛观后感

　　差距·危机·希望
    ——世乒赛男子团体决赛观后感
    著名围棋选手聂卫平输给日本九段围棋选手羽根泰正后说：“我知道这一天早晚会来到。”同样，人们早已预感到的中国乒乓球男队的失利，昨晚终于清楚地展现在眼前。只不过令人难以接受的是，以０∶５的惨败丢掉斯韦思林杯。
    用人捉襟见肘
    西德乒乓名将绍勒尔评论中国男队的失利时说：“这届世乒赛我一看到中国队的报名名单，就知道他们没有什么新东西。”绍勒尔的话没有错。前几届团体决赛中国男队上场人选，每一次都有新变化，总有带着新特点的新人出其不意地站在对手面前。第３６届有谢赛克、蔡振华，３７届有江嘉良，３８届有陈新华、陈龙灿，３９届有滕毅。
    这次第４０届决赛，中国队出阵的人员、打法和两年前一模一样。团体赛报名时，许绍发教练咬了咬牙，报上寄希望成为“黑马”（马文革）和“神童”（于沈潼）的两位新人。无奈两个小将实在扶不起来，又缺实力又缺特点，预赛中连不很强的对手也打不下来，决赛怎么敢用呢？
    失去打法优势
    中国队三员老将在紧张的决赛气氛中作战，尽了很大努力。如果有几盘关键球处理好些，局面或许改观。但是，中国队失败的首要原因还是在于技术处于劣势，特长被遏制。发球、发球抢攻、前三板争取主动，这些都是中国队以往获胜的法宝，昨晚决赛都不灵了。瑞典队反而在发球质量方面占上风。
    采用近台快攻打法的中国选手，失去前三板优势，相持回合球技术又明显不如对手，处于下风就毫不奇怪。瑞典队教练奥斯特在赛后的记者招待会上说：“这么多年中国队总是一个打法，我不明白中国人为什么不变一变。”
    何日夺回冠军
    一向不服输的李富荣在决赛后讲了句耐人寻味的话：“我看中国队再夺回斯韦思林杯恐怕需要两三届（四至六年）的时间。”
    １９７９年中国男队丢掉世界冠军后，国内有一批生气勃勃的年轻新秀马上接上来，所以短短两年便夺回优势。目前我国乒乓行家忧虑的正是找不到像当年那样出色的新苗子。
    除此之外，还有一个比这更令人担忧的问题。早在男子团体决赛前几天，中国队教练许绍发半开玩笑半认真地说：“主教练这个位置吃力不讨好，我干得够长的，不能再干了。”实际上不少名运动员也都不想干了，想早点退役去国外打球赚钱。
    缺少新人，尚可培养。以中国乒乓球运动几十年形成的雄厚基础，造就几名出色尖子并不是难办到的事。可是一旦队伍人心散了，连培养人的教练都没心思干下去。这个危机更可怕。
    不过，人们从以往的经验中有理由相信，只要中国乒乓球界存在一个坚强的团结的领导核心，埋头苦干几年，中国男队目前的低潮能够尽快渡过，曙光并不遥远。
