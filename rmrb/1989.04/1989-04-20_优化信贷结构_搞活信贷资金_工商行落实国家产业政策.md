Optimizing Credit Structure and Activating Credit Funds

    The Industrial and Commercial Bank Implements National Industrial Policies

    Xinhua News Agency reports: Correspondent Méi Hóngrú reports: Optimizing the credit structure, activating the existing 43 billion yuan of working capital loans (balance), making good use of the 5.3 billion yuan of new loans (scale) this year, and tapping into the potential of funds are the top priorities for the Industrial and Commercial Bank this year. This was announced by Vice President Liu Tinghuan of the Industrial and Commercial Bank at the National Credit Work Conference held from April 15 to 19.

    In the economic overheating that has accumulated over the past few years, there has been an abnormal phenomenon where thousands of households are engaged in infrastructure projects, and working capital relies on loans. This has made the supply-demand contradiction of production and operation funds increasingly prominent. On the other hand, since the beginning of this year, corporate deposits have decreased significantly, while the demand for loans from various sectors is high, further exacerbating the supply-demand contradiction of funds.

    In terms of fund management and use, there are scattered situations in various places. Each province, municipality, and autonomous region often emphasize their own priorities, and the situation of enterprises arbitrarily raising funds is also very serious. This makes it difficult for banks to raise funds to support the national key development industries such as energy, transportation, and raw materials.

    Facing the severe fund supply-demand situation, the Industrial and Commercial Bank decided:

    First, to require each region to propose a portion of the accumulated working capital loans from previous years to be managed by the head office and provincial, municipal, and autonomous regional branches, and to be returned with a cap to support key state-owned enterprises in the region.

    Second, to use the majority of this year's new loans to guarantee the purchase of agricultural and sideline products by the central and provincial, municipal, and district governments, as well as to support the production and operation of state-owned large and medium-sized backbone enterprises.

    Third, to strengthen the clearance of inventory and accounts, clean up overdue and misappropriated funds, and tap into the potential of funds to ensure key support and effective supply.

### 优化信贷结构　搞活信贷资金  工商行落实国家产业政策

　　优化信贷结构　搞活信贷资金    
    工商行落实国家产业政策
    本报讯  记者梅洪如报道：优化信贷结构，搞活现有的４３００多亿元工商流动资金贷款（余额），用好今年新增的５３０亿元贷款（规模），挖掘资金潜力，坚决贯彻国家产业政策，这是工商银行今年头等重要的任务。
    工商银行副行长刘廷焕在４月１５日至１９日召开的全国信贷工作会议上宣布了这个消息。
    在这几年积累起来的经济过热中，出现了千家万户搞基建，流动资金靠贷款的不正常现象，使生产经营资金的供求矛盾越来越突出。另一方面，今年年初以来，企业存款减少较严重，而各方面对贷款的需求很大，更加剧了资金供求矛盾。
    在资金管理和使用上，各地存在分散状况。各省、市、自治区往往强调自己的重点，企业随便集资情况也很严重，这使银行难以筹集资金，支持国家重点发展的能源、交通、原材料等产业。
    面对严峻的资金供求形势，工商银行决定：
    一、要求各地从历年积占的流动资金贷款中提出一部分，分别归总行和省、市、自治区行掌握，戴帽返还，支持所在地区的国家重点企业。
    二、将今年新增贷款的绝大部分用于中央及省、市、区必保的农副产品收购，以及支持国营大中型骨干企业的生产经营。
    三、加强清仓查库，清理拖欠、挪用等，大力挖掘资金潜力，保证重点，支持有效供给。
