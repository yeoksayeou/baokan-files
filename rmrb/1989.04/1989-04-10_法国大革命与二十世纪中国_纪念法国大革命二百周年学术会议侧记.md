The French Revolution and Twentieth-Century China
— A Record of the Academic Conference Commemorating the 200th Anniversary of the French Revolution

Reporter: Zhang Shulin

This year marks the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. From March 14 to 15, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the Chinese Historical Society jointly held the "Academic Conference Commemorating the 200th Anniversary of the French Revolution" in Beijing. Over a hundred Chinese scholars and a delegation of French scholars led by Michel Vovelle, Chairman of the Historical Committee of the French Committee for the Commemoration of the French Revolution, attended the conference. Scholars from both countries engaged in heated discussions on the legacy of the French Revolution and its influence on twentieth-century China.

The Legacy of the French Revolution: Shared Diverse Development

After the French revolutionaries stormed the Bastille in 1789, for a considerable period, the forces of revolution and restoration, republic and empire, alternated in power. The direct result of the Revolution was that no matter which force was in control, it was impossible to suppress people's freedom of speech and thought, nor to establish a uniform, lifeless ideology to govern the people. Various thoughts and theories emerged during the revolutionary period, including republicanism, anarchism, and socialism, each with its own market and followers. It was in this environment that many important theories and intellectual achievements were produced, influencing the progress of French and global civilization. Some scholars introduced that Chen Duxiu, in his article "The French and Modern Civilization," believed that the three theories with epoch-making influence in modern Western thought—human rights theory, biological evolution theory, and socialist theory—all originated from France.

French scholars believe that the pursuit of shared diverse development is the most important legacy of the French Revolution. That is, there is no need for one tradition or idea to eliminate another; people have the right to choose from any tradition or idea. This was precisely the pursuit of the people in 1789. The French nation and state have undergone various changes, but throughout this process, diverse thoughts and evaluations of the French Revolution have never ceased.

It is precisely because of the pursuit of diverse development established by the French Revolution that Paris has become a convergence point for various contemporary ideologies, a place particularly conducive to the cultivation of thought, and a cradle for nurturing future generations. There, youth choose their future paths amidst the clash of various ideologies. Important leaders of contemporary China such as Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping, Chen Yi, and Nie Rongzhen, as well as cultural and scientific figures like Hou Wailu, Ba Jin, Fu Lei, Xu Beihong, Wu Zuoren, Xian Xinghai, Qian Sanqiang, and He Zehui, were all part of a generation that studied and lived in France, where they received the baptism and nurturing of new ideas and cultures, thus embarking on their chosen paths.

The French Revolution: Reflections of Chinese Intellectuals

When the French Revolution occurred, China was in the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty, and people were intoxicated by the so-called "Qing-Kang Prosperity." China's response to the French Revolution and its ideas was almost a century later in this century, but once spread, it was quite strong. From Kang Youwei to Sun Yat-sen, from Chen Duxiu to Mao Zedong, all Chinese politicians, thinkers, and most intellectuals reflected on this revolution. This reflection included an epoch-making understanding of the French Revolution, an analysis of the political and philosophical ideas it represented, and the enlightenment China derived from it. The young Mao Zedong, who was nurtured by Chinese political thought from Liang Qichao to Li Dazhao, once discussed his understanding of the French Revolution. He believed: "France, with the great union of the people, and the great union of the royalists, achieved the victory of 'political reform.'"

Scholars at the conference analyzed the influence of the French Revolution on four periods in the early twentieth century: the active period of Chinese thought, the period before and after Sun Yat-sen led the establishment of the republic, the period before and after Li Dazhao and Chen Duxiu led the establishment of the Chinese proletarian party, and the past decade. They believed that among Chinese bourgeois thinkers, there were those who advocated reform under a constitutional monarchy, those who advocated political revolution, and those who shifted from advocating reform to revolution. However, regardless of which faction, all were influenced by the French Revolution. Sun Yat-sen combined the French Revolution's slogan of "liberty, equality, fraternity" with his revolutionary slogan of the Three Principles of the People, pushing forward the Chinese democratic revolutionary thought. In terms of theoretical understanding, Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao surpassed the thinkers of the early twentieth century. They had a more comprehensive understanding of the significance of the democratic revolution. Under the influence of the French Revolution and later the Russian October Revolution, Chen Duxiu sought theoretical answers to the relationship between democracy and socialism, while Li Dazhao worked to connect and transform the old democratic revolution to the new democratic revolution in the Chinese revolutionary movement.

Some scholars, after reviewing the relationship between the French Revolution and China in the first half of the twentieth century, drew the following three conclusions: (1) In the early twentieth century, China, in seeking a way out, saw from the French Revolution that China's future lay in overthrowing feudal rule through revolution and establishing a republic, thus beginning China's history in the twentieth century, with revolution as its theme. (2) In the first quarter of the century, represented by Sun Yat-sen, the Chinese overthrew the feudal dynasty and established a republic. However, they realized from practice that political revolution did not solve China's problems. They then found new theoretical and practical support in the Russian October Revolution, beginning the new democratic revolution with socialism as the goal. This became the theme of China's history in the second quarter of the twentieth century. (3) The two stages of the Chinese revolution, from democracy to socialism, had not only the logic of political development but also the logic of ideological development. This logic not only indicated that the birth of the People's Republic of China was a necessity in the development of Chinese history but also foreshadowed that the new republic, in advancing towards socialism, would still have to continue to complete the anti-feudal historical tasks required by the democratic revolution.

At the conference, scholars from both countries also discussed issues such as the French Revolution and French cultural mentality, the French Revolution and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, the introduction and influence of the Declaration in modern China, and the constitutions of the French Revolution period.

　　法国大革命与二十世纪中国
    ——纪念法国大革命二百周年学术会议侧记
    本报记者  张书林
    今年是法国大革命二百周年。３月１４日至１５日，中国社会科学院和中国史学会在北京联合召开了“纪念法国大革命２００周年学术会议”，百余名中国学者和以全法纪念法国大革命委员会史学组主席米歇尔·弗维尔教授为首的法国学者代表团出席了会议。中法两国学者就法国大革命的遗产以及对二十世纪中国的影响等问题展开了热烈讨论。
    法国大革命的遗产：共享多样化发展
    １７８９年，法国革命者攻克巴士底狱之后，在相当一段时间里，革命与复辟、共和与帝制的势力反复交替着。大革命的直接成果是，不管哪一种力量得势，都不可能压制人们的言论和思想自由，也不可能建立一种统一的毫无生气的思想去统治人民。大革命时期各种各样的思想、理论应运而生，共和主义、无政府主义以及社会主义思想都有自己的市场和拥戴者。正是在这样的环境下，它产生了许多重要的理论、思想成果，影响了法国及全人类文明的进程。有的学者介绍说，陈独秀在《法兰西人与近世文明》一文中，认为近代西方具有划时代影响的三种理论：人权理论、生物进化理论和社会主义理论，就是来自法国。
    法国学者认为，共享多样化发展，是法国大革命最重要的遗产。就是说，不必由一种传统或想法去消灭另一种传统或想法，人们有权在任何一种传统和想法中进行选择。这也正是１７８９年人们的追求。法兰西民族和国家经历了种种变迁，但在这个过程中，对于法国大革命的多样化的思考和评论从未中止。
    正是由于法国大革命所奠定的多样化发展的追求，巴黎才成为当代世界各种思潮的汇合点，成为一个特别能锻炼人的思想的地方，成为培养未来一代的摇篮。在那里，青年在各种思潮的激荡中选择自己未来的道路。当代中国的重要领导人周恩来、邓小平、陈毅、聂荣臻，科学文化领域的侯外庐、巴金、傅雷、徐悲鸿、吴作人、冼星海、钱三强、何泽慧等，都是早年曾在法国读书和活动的一代，都是在那里接受了新思想、新文化的洗礼和培育，从而走上自己所选择的道路的。
    法国大革命：中国知识分子的思考
    法国大革命发生的时候，中国正处在清朝乾隆年间，人们正为所谓“乾嘉盛世”而陶醉。中国对法国大革命及其思想的反响差不多是一百年以后本世纪的事，然而一经传播，却相当强烈。从康有为到孙中山，从陈独秀到毛泽东，所有中国政治家、思想家以及大多数知识分子都对这场革命进行了思考。这种思考包括对法国大革命划时代的认识，对大革命所代表的政治和哲学思想的分析以及中国从中得到的启示。曾受到从梁启超到李大钊的中国政治思想孕育的青年毛泽东，就曾谈过他对法国大革命的理解。他认为：“法兰西以民众的大联合，和王党的大联合相抗，收了‘政治改革’的胜利。”
    与会学者分析了法国大革命对二十世纪初中国思想界活跃时期，孙中山领导创立共和国前后的时期，李大钊、陈独秀领导创立中国工人阶级政党前后的时期和近十年这四个时期所产生的影响。他们认为，在中国资产阶级思想家中，有主张在君主立宪下进行改良的，有主张实行政治革命的，有由主张改良转向革命的，但无论哪一派，都受到法国大革命的影响。孙中山则把法国大革命“自由、平等、博爱”的口号与他所领导的革命的三民主义口号结合起来，把中国民主革命思想向前推进了一步。就理论认识说，陈独秀和李大钊超越于二十世纪初期思想家之上，他们对民主革命的意义有较全面的了解。在法国大革命以及后来俄国十月革命思想的激荡下，陈独秀在理论上寻求解答民主主义与社会主义的关系，李大钊则在中国革命运动中致力于从旧民主主义革命到新民主主义革命的联结与转变。
    有的学者在回顾了二十世纪前半叶法国大革命和中国的关系后，得出以下三点看法：（１）进入二十世纪的中国在寻找出路时，从法国大革命看到中国的前途就在于以革命推翻封建统治，建立共和国，由此开始了中国在二十世纪的历史，革命成为它的主题。（２）在前四分之一世纪里，以孙中山为代表的中国人推翻了封建王朝，建立共和国，但从实践中认识到政治革命并未解决中国的问题，于是又从俄国十月革命找到新的理论与实际的支持，开始了新民主主义革命，以社会主义为目标。这成为二十世纪第二个四分之一时期中国历史的主题。（３）中国革命的两个阶段，从民主主义到社会主义的转变，不仅有它的政治发展的逻辑，也有其思想发展的逻辑。这个逻辑既表明中华人民共和国的诞生是中国历史发展的必然，又预示了新的人民共和国在向社会主义前进时还不得不继续完成民主革命所要求的反封建的历史任务。
    会上，中外学者还讨论了法国大革命与法国的文化心态，法国大革命与人权宣言，人权宣言在近代中国的介绍和影响，以及法国大革命时期的宪法等问题。
