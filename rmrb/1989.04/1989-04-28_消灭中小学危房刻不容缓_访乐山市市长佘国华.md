In 1988, Sichuan Province had more than 20 counties that eliminated dangerous school buildings in primary and secondary schools, and five of these counties are under the jurisdiction of Leshan City. By chance, the reporter met Leshan City Mayor She Guohua, who was in Beijing for the National People's Congress. When talking about eliminating dangerous school buildings, his emotions became particularly intense: "Dangerous school buildings are a relatively common phenomenon nationwide. Forty years after the founding of the nation, we cannot allow the tragedy of school buildings collapsing and killing students to happen again! Eliminating dangerous school buildings is urgent."

Leshan City's 17 counties and cities have more than 5,000 primary and secondary schools, many of which are located in extremely dilapidated mud houses or old temples. A few years ago, accidents of school buildings collapsing and students dying occurred frequently.

After She Guohua took office as mayor in 1985, he would inspect schools whenever he went to districts and counties. He saw that some school buildings had no windows on all four sides but were still drafty, and others were in such poor condition that they seemed ready to collapse in the wind and rain.

This mayor, born in a farming family, felt very heavy-hearted and decided to eliminate dangerous school buildings throughout the city.

The most difficult part of eliminating dangerous buildings is the lack of funds, and except for a few relatively wealthy counties like Emei, the rest are either impoverished mountain counties or minority autonomous counties. Some counties are so poor that they cannot even pay the salaries of government officials. Despite the severe shortage of funds, the Leshan Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government did everything possible to raise funds. In addition to a small amount of funds allocated by the province, the city contributed a certain amount of construction funds, and the municipal and county finances allocated funds, with the public also contributing. They used every possible means to ensure that the funds for eliminating dangerous school buildings were in place. Last year, Leshan City raised more than 20 million yuan from various sources to build 70,000 square meters of school buildings. Five counties have completely eliminated dangerous school buildings in primary and secondary schools and have passed provincial inspections. Mayor She said, "The remaining 12 counties' dangerous buildings are expected to be completely eliminated this year."

The reporter was somewhat skeptical: "Can they really be completely eliminated?" He was confident: "Why not? We have signed agreements with the county mayors, and the funds have all been secured. How can building houses not be fast?"

In addition to generally improving the conditions of primary and secondary schools throughout the city, more than 20 new schools have been built. Currently, the living conditions of old teachers in municipal middle schools are generally better than those of their peers in the municipal government.

In recent years, Leshan City has focused on education in a down-to-earth manner. Currently, the teaching staff is stable, teaching quality has improved, and district, township, and village cadres and the masses are enthusiastic about education.

When discussing the relationship between focusing on education and focusing on the economy, Mayor She Guohua said: "To alleviate poverty, we must first cultivate people. Backward regions are first and foremost educationally backward, so we should start with education. Not only should we focus on primary and secondary education, but we should also focus on adult education. Only when the quality of people is generally improved and the scientific and cultural level of people is generally improved, will there be sufficient momentum for economic development."

　　消灭中小学危房刻不容缓   
    ——访乐山市市长佘国华
    本报记者  赖仁琼
    四川省去年有２０多个县消灭了中小学危房，而乐山市所辖的县就占５个。一个偶然的机会，记者巧遇来京开人代会的乐山市市长佘国华，谈起消灭中小学危房，他的情绪便格外激动：“中小学危房是全国存在的较普遍现象。建国４０年了，我们不能再让校舍倒塌压死学生的悲剧发生！消灭中小学危房已刻不容缓。”
    乐山市的１７个县市共有５０００多所中小学，不少学校设在极简陋的土房或破庙里。几年前，校舍坍塌学生惨死的事故时有发生。
    １９８５年佘国华就任市长后，每到区县检查工作，都要去学校看看。他看到有的校舍四面无窗，却四面透风，还有的校舍破败不堪，在风雨中摇摇欲坠。
    这位农家出生的市长心情十分沉重，下决心要在全市消灭中小学危房。
    消灭危房最难的是缺经费，而乐山市除峨眉几个县较富裕外，其余的不是地处山区的穷县就是少数民族州县。有的县穷得发不出机关干部的工资。尽管经费如此短缺，乐山市委、市政府还是想尽一切办法筹集资金。除省里少量拨款外，市里拿出一定的建设费，市、县财政拨款，群众集资，千方百计把消灭中小学危房的款项落到实处。去年，乐山市各方筹集资金２０００多万元，修建校舍７万多平方米，有５个县全部消灭中小学危房并已经省验收合格。佘市长说：“其余１２个县的危房可望今年全部消灭。”
    记者不大相信：“真能全部消灭吗？”他胸有成竹：“怎么不能？我们跟各县的县长已签订了协议，经费又全部落实了，修房子还能不快？”
    全市除普遍改善中小学办学条件外，还新建了２０多所学校。目前，市级中学老教师的住房普遍比同龄市府工作人员好。
    乐山市这几年扎扎实实抓教育，目前，教师队伍稳定，教学质量提高，区、乡、村干部群众办学热情高涨。
    谈及抓教育与抓经济的关系，佘国华市长说：“治穷先要育人。落后地区首先是教育落后，我们就应先从教育抓起。不仅抓中小学教育，还要抓成人教育。只有人的素质普遍提高，人的科学文化水平普遍提高，发展经济才有充足的后劲。”
