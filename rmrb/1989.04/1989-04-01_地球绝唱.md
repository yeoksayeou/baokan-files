	The Earth's Last Song
	Poetry by Cao Zhi Hui, Art by Zhang Yao Ning

	My future is not bright,
	My body is full of mouths,
	Fifty billion people laugh at me,
	I am worried about food.

	People surround me like mountains,
	Who is to blame for the overpopulation?
	Population explosion is a big bomb,
	Housing and employment will bring sorrow.

	More people mean more land is destroyed each year,
	My appearance is becoming haggard,
	Ecological balance is disrupted,
	The environment is deteriorating and cannot be reversed.

	I am bent over by the weight of people,
	My legs are tired from carrying the burden,
	People calculate my sweat and blood,
	The burden is too heavy and I am exhausted.

	Urge people to wake up and not fall asleep,
	Think of danger when you are full,
	If the population is not controlled,
	People and I will both suffer!

　　地球绝唱
    曹治淮诗　张耀宁画
    我的前景并不美，
    浑身上下尽是嘴，
    五十亿人在笑我，
    我为粮食锁愁眉。
    人山人海把我围，
    人满为患该怪谁？
    人口膨胀大爆炸，
    住房就业将生悲。
    人多耕地年年毁，
    我的容颜变憔悴，
    生态平衡遭破坏，
    环境恶化难挽回。
    我已被人压弯腰，
    我也为人累细腿，
    人们算计我血汗，
    负担超重太疲惫。
    劝人清醒别沉睡，
    温饱之时定思危，
    如果人口不控制，
    人们与我同倒霉！（附图片）
