Edition: 6

Your newspaper published a letter from a reader on January 11th on the fifth page titled "The Quality of the Middle School Language Textbooks We Purchased is Poor." In response, our bulletin board published a short commentary on this matter and enlarged the reader's letter for publication. The editorial board held an expanded meeting to discuss this issue and acknowledged that the leadership is responsible for the errors in the textbooks. To ensure the quality of the textbooks, we have reaffirmed the three-level review system and made corresponding decisions to learn from this lesson.

　　人民教育出版社接受批评
    你报１月１１日第五版刊登《我们购进的中学语文课本质量差》的读者来信后，我社黑板报就此事发表了短评，并将你报的读者来信放大刊出。社务扩大会专门研究此事，认为教材中出现的错误，领导上是有责任的。为了保证教材质量，我们重申了教材的三审制度，并相应作出了有关决定，从中吸取教训。
