The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund recently held their spring meeting in Washington, where they focused on discussing the international debt issue. For the first time, the meeting affirmed the debt reduction plan for third-world countries proposed by U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, bringing new hope to the resolution of the long-standing international debt crisis that has lasted for seven years. However, several important Western member countries attending the meeting expressed reservations about certain aspects of the "Brady Plan," which has made people's concerns about the debt crisis "just as the worry on the brow disappears, it reappears in the heart."

The "Brady Plan" is a replacement for the "Baker Plan." The "Baker Plan" failed because commercial banks refused to provide additional loans to third-world debtor countries, rendering the "Baker Trilogy" of commercial banks providing loans, international financial institutions providing guarantees, and debtor countries adjusting their economies ineffective. The "Brady Plan" proposed by the U.S. this time avoids the pitfalls of the former by requiring commercial banks to voluntarily forgive part of the debt, while also requiring international financial institutions to continue providing interest guarantees for debtor countries implementing economic adjustment plans. This "positive step" has been welcomed by third-world debtor countries and supported by many commercial banks, moving the efforts to resolve the debt crisis out of the "Baker Plan" dead end.

However, it is perhaps too early to claim that the debt crisis will be easily resolved. First, it should be noted that the "Brady Plan" at most can only reduce the $1.3 trillion debt of third-world countries by one-fifth, while the Latin American debtor countries' representatives pointed out at the Washington meeting that to ease the crisis, the debt should be reduced by 40% to 50%. Therefore, even if the "Brady Plan" is effective, the goals of the North and South are still far apart.

Moreover, the Group of Seven this time did not reach a consensus on all aspects of the "Brady Plan." Britain and West Germany have reservations about the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund providing guarantees for debtor countries' interest payments, fearing that commercial banks will thus transfer their crisis to the governments of industrialized countries. This touches on a crucial link: developing countries that need debt forgiveness also need new loans to adjust their economies. If international financial institutions and industrialized countries cannot raise sufficient funds to provide guarantees for these countries' interest payments, commercial banks will not provide new loans. The "Brady Plan" may repeat the fate of the "Baker Plan."

Therefore, the key to the implementation of the "Brady Plan" lies in whether the governments of industrialized countries and international financial institutions can coordinate with commercial banks to raise sufficient funds to guarantee the repayment of debtor countries' interest. From the atmosphere of the Washington meeting, it can be seen that both industrialized countries and commercial banks have the willingness to coordinate their actions. In particular, Japan, as the rising star with the most abundant funds in the Group of Seven, is willing to contribute more to fundraising. However, Japan demands that its voting rights in the International Monetary Fund and other institutions be expanded in exchange for increasing its share of funds, while the United States and other member countries are not very willing to see this aggressive trading partner have too much influence. In any case, in the face of the debt crisis, the contradictions among industrialized countries should not continue to be an obstacle to resolving the crisis.

Improving and developing South-North relations and easing the debt crisis is a key issue. Under the premise that both the South and the North do their best, the major creditor countries in the West should bear more responsibilities and obligations. People hope that the "Brady Plan" will have some effect in easing the debt crisis and will not be like the "Baker Plan," which only "paints a cake to satisfy hunger" for debtor countries. Otherwise, the industrialized countries themselves will ultimately suffer greatly.

### 莫为债务国“画饼充饥”

　　莫为债务国“画饼充饥”
　　景宪法
    世界银行和国际货币基金组织最近在华盛顿举行的春季会议上着重讨论了国际债务问题。会议首次肯定了美国财长布雷迪提出的减免第三世界债务计划，为解决长达7年之久的国际债务危机带来了新希望。但是，出席会议的西方几个重要成员国对“布雷迪计划”中某些方面提出保留意见，却使人们对债务危机的忧虑“才下眉头、又上心头”。
      “布雷迪计划”是对“贝克计划”的取代。“贝克计划”之所以失败，是因为商业银行拒绝向第三世界债务国追加贷款，从而使商业银行提供贷款、国际金融机构提供担保、债务国调整经济的“贝克三部曲”名存实亡。美国这次推出的“布雷迪计划”避开前者的症结所在，要求商业银行自愿减免部分债务，同时要求国际金融机构为实行经济调整计划的债务国继续借贷提供债息担保。这一“积极步骤”既受到第三世界债务国的欢迎，又得到许多商业银行的支持，使多年来解决债务危机的努力走出了“贝克计划”的死胡同。
    但是，由此断言债务危机将迎刃而解，似乎为时尚早。首先应该看到，“布雷迪计划”充其量只能将第三世界1.3万亿美元债务削去1／5，而拉美债务国代表这次在华盛顿会议上指出，如欲缓解危机，债务应减去40％至50％。因此，即使“布雷迪计划”能够奏效，南北各自的目标仍相去甚远。
    何况，西方七国集团这次并未在“布雷迪计划”的所有方面达成一致意见。英国和西德对于让世界银行和国际货币基金组织出面为债务国偿息提供担保持保留意见，担心商业银行因此会将其面临的危机转嫁到工业国政府身上。这就触及到一个重要环节：减免债务的发展中国家在调整经济时需要新贷款，如果国际金融机构和工业国不能筹措足够资金为这些国家偿息提供担保，商业银行就不肯提供新贷款。“布雷迪计划”很可能重蹈“贝克计划”的覆辙。
    因此，“布雷迪计划”实施之关键，在于工业国政府和国际金融机构能否同商业银行协调一致，为担保债务国偿还债息筹措足够资金。从华盛顿会议的气氛来看，工业国和商业银行都有协调行动的愿望。特别是日本作为七国集团中资金最雄厚的后起之秀，愿意为集资作出更多贡献。不过，日本要求在增加其资金份额的同时，应扩大其在国际货币基金组织等机构中的表决权限，而美国等其它成员国却不大愿意看到这位咄咄逼人的贸易伙伴影响过大。无论如何，在债务危机岌岌可危的今天，工业国之间的矛盾不应继续成为阻碍解决危机的羁绊。
    改善和发展南北关系，缓解债务危机是一关键。在南北双方各尽其力的大前提下，作为西方主要工业国家的债权国理应承担更多的责任和义务。人们希望“布雷迪计划”在缓解债务危机方面有所作为，而不要像“贝克计划”那样仅为债务国“画饼充饥”，否则，工业国自己到头来也是难免深受其害的。
