	The democratic governments at all levels in Tibet have been strengthened and developed since the peaceful liberation 30 years ago.

	According to statistics, there are currently 7 prefectures (cities) and 72 counties (cities) in the region, along with 71 districts, 895 townships, and 30 towns. From the autonomous region to the prefectures (cities), counties, districts, and townships, the main leaders of the people's democratic government organizations are all ethnic cadres; ethnic Tibetan cadres make up about 80% of the cadre team at the prefecture and county levels.

	Before the democratic reforms, Tibet was under a feudal serfdom system, with a political and religious fusion power structure. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, transitional consultative bodies such as the Liberation Committee of Chamdo Region and the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region were successively established. Starting in 1960, based on the principles of the "Outline for the Implementation of Regional Autonomy for Nationalities," Tibet gradually established various levels of people's democratic governments. By 1962, all 7 prefectures and one city in the region had established prefectural offices and municipal governments, and 72 counties, over 200 districts, and over 1,300 townships had established government organizations. In 1965, the Tibet Autonomous Region was formally established in Lhasa, and the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen had a national regional autonomous people's democratic government, truly realizing their aspiration to be masters of their own house.

	In 1984, Tibet changed the system of combined political and administrative power, establishing 2,055 township governments across the region, further improving and strengthening the grassroots government, and accelerating the development of the agricultural and pastoral economy.

　　西藏各级民主政权巩固发展
    各级政府主要负责人全部由民族干部担任
    新华社拉萨４月８日电  （记者王浩）和平解放３０年来，西藏各级人民民主政权从无到有、由弱变强，逐步得到巩固和发展。
    据统计，全区目前共设置７个地（市），７２个县（市），７１个区，８９５个乡，３０个镇。从自治区到地（市）、县、区、乡，人民民主政权组织的主要负责人全部由民族干部担任；地县级干部队伍中，藏族干部占８０％左右。
    民主改革前，西藏是封建农奴主专政制度，是政教合一的政权体制。西藏和平解放后，陆续成立了昌都地区解放委员会、西藏自治区筹备委员会等过渡性的协商办事机构。从１９６０年开始，根据《民族区域自治实施纲要》的原则，西藏逐步建立起各级人民民主政权。到１９６２年，全区７个专区和一个市建立了专员公署和市人民政府，７２个县、２００多个区、１３００多个乡建立了政权组织。１９６５年，西藏自治区在拉萨正式成立，广大农牧民有了民族区域自治的人民民主政权，真正实现了当家作主的愿望。
    １９８４年，西藏改变了政社合一的体制，在全区建立了２０５５个乡人民政府，进一步改善和加强了基层政权，加快了农牧区经济发展的步伐。
