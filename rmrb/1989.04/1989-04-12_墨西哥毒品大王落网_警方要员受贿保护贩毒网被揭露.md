    Mexican Drug Kingpin Captured;
    Police Officials Bribed to Protect Drug Network Exposed

    By Guo Weicheng

    MEXICO CITY, April 10 — The Mexican Attorney General, Del Castillo, confirmed today that Felix Gallardo, a notorious drug trafficker wanted by Mexico, the United States, and other Latin American countries, was arrested on Saturday (April 8) in the afternoon in Guadalajara, a city in central Mexico. He has been transferred to Mexico City under strict security measures by a military aircraft.

    Del Castillo, the Attorney General, announced at noon today to reporters: After three months of meticulous surveillance and investigation, Mexican federal prosecutors have finally captured this international-level drug trafficker. They seized the opportunity when he was hiding in a residence in Guadalajara and arrested him. At the scene, a batch of cocaine, a large number of wireless and wired communication equipment, mobile radios, carbines, light machine guns, handguns, hand grenades, and a large number of bullets were seized.

    Felix Gallardo, 43, began his career in drug trafficking in 1971. Due to his ruthlessness and cunning, he quickly became the leader of the drug trafficking gang, earning the title of the "drug tsar" of Mexico. He has close ties with the underworld in the United States and some South American countries, integrating planting, harvesting, trafficking, and selling, moving between North and South America, and smuggling large quantities of drugs into the United States. He is also a wanted criminal in the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. The drug trafficking network he commands is elusive and unobstructed, all because he has bribed Mexican state police for long-term protection. Even the deputy representative (commissioner) of the Mexican Attorney General's Office in Sinaloa, Corso Marin, became his informant, constantly providing him with information about anti-drug operations, tipping him off.

    This drug kingpin paved his way with money, not only buying information with large sums but also bribing federal highway police chiefs in Mexico City (Federal District), the border states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo León, opening a "safe corridor." Therefore, his drug trafficking gang could always pass unobstructed, reaching the United States. Those he bribed also included the police chiefs of Sinaloa and Culiacán. All these high-ranking police officers on the front lines of anti-drug operations became his protectors, allowing the drug king to sit securely for 18 years. This time, the drug king and his protectors, those high-ranking police officers commanding anti-drug operations, were all arrested and imprisoned.

　　墨西哥毒品大王落网
　  警方要员受贿保护贩毒网被揭露
    本报墨西哥城4月10日电　记者郭伟成报道：墨西哥联邦总检察长德尔卡斯蒂略今天证实：被墨西哥、美国和其它拉美国家通缉已久的毒品走私大枭费利克斯·加利亚尔多星期六（4月8日）下午在墨西哥中部城市瓜达拉哈拉被捕，并已经在严密的保安措施下，由空军专机解押到墨西哥城。
    德尔卡斯蒂略总检察长今天中午向记者们宣布：墨西哥总检察院特工人员经过3个月的严密跟踪侦察，切实掌握了这个被认为是“国际水平”的头号毒品走私犯的行踪，终于趁他秘密潜伏在瓜达拉哈拉一处据点（住宅）里的机会，果断地予以拘捕。在现场还缴获了一批可卡因毒品，一大批无线与有线电通讯器材、移动电台、卡宾枪、轻机枪、手枪、手榴弹和大批子弹。
    43岁的费利克斯·加利亚尔多从1971年开始从事毒品走私。由于心狠手毒、诡计多端，很快成为毒品走私团伙中的首要人物，有墨西哥毒品“沙皇”之称。他与美国、南美洲一些国家的黑社会有着密切的联系，集种植、收获、贩运、销售于一体，来往于南北美洲，把大量毒品运进美国，在美国毒品控制局也是挂了号的要犯。由他指挥的毒品贩运神出鬼没，畅行无阻，概因他通过贿赂，取得了墨西哥各州警方的长期庇护。甚至连墨西哥联邦总检察院派驻锡那罗亚州的反贩毒副代表（专员）科尔萨·马林也成了这个毒品大枭的眼线，不断向他提供反贩毒行动部署的消息，通风报信。
    这个毒品大枭用金钱铺路，不但重金收买情报，还收买了墨西哥城（联邦区）、与美国南部陆海交接的塔毛利帕斯州、新莱昂州等地联邦道路警察长官们，打开了一条“安全走廊”，因此，他手下的毒品走私团伙总能畅行无阻，直达美国。被他收买的还有锡那罗亚州警察厅长、库利奥坎警察局长等高级警员，所有这些处于反贩毒第一线的指挥官们都成了毒枭的保护伞，使得这个毒王一直稳座钓鱼台，纵横江湖18年之久。这次，毒王和他的保护人，那些指挥反贩毒的高级警员们一起被捕，锒铛入狱。
