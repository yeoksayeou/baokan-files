If one is content with traditional banking services such as deposits, loans, and settlements, being a bank president can be a relatively easy job. However, over the past few years, Zhao Youzhi, the president of the Shanyang City branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, has been diligently tackling several challenging tasks.

Not long ago, the scientific and technological sector was mistakenly considered a field that only consumes money without generating revenue. There were no established channels for scientific and technological loans, no regulations for credit types, and no guidelines from higher authorities. This area was generally regarded as a forbidden zone for bank credit.

In 1984, shortly after Zhao Youzhi took over as the president of the Shanyang City branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, he decided to venture into this forbidden zone. That year, with the support of the municipal party committee and government, the bank was the first in the country to establish a "Science and Technology Development Credit Department." In August of the same year, the head office of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China promoted Shanyang's experience and decided to launch new product and new technology development loan services nationwide. To date, the Shanyang City branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China has issued nearly 50 million yuan in scientific and technological loans, supporting over 150 scientific and technological projects. These projects have permeated industries such as chemicals, electronics, building materials, textiles, machinery, and light industry. Already, 85% of these projects have been put into production, generating over 130 million yuan in output value and adding nearly 30 million yuan in taxes.

In recent years, how can one balance the need to tighten credit while supporting enterprise production? This is a dilemma that needs to be addressed.

Shortly after the Spring Festival in 1986, Zhao Youzhi and several deputy presidents conducted investigations in various counties and districts. They discovered that some enterprises, fearing price increases for raw materials, were overstocking supplies in a "preparation for war and famine" mentality. Others prioritized speed over efficiency, leading to blind production and excessive inventory in warehouses.

He promptly reported these findings to Mayor Yang Binqing, who was visiting the bank for an inspection. Soon after, Shanyang established a Comprehensive Fund Management Leading Group, addressing issues from production and sales to storage and circulation. They cleared out 7.5 billion yuan worth of problematic funds and goods, and managed to handle and activate 6.7 billion yuan.

In response to the low efficiency of fund usage in some enterprises, Zhao Youzhi decided to introduce the bank's mechanisms into the enterprises, establishing internal enterprise banks. This way, both those managing the money and those using it would keep track of the financial gains and losses.

Currently, in Shanyang, a three-tiered fund management channel has been established, integrating the state bank, the enterprise internal bank, and various accounting units within the enterprise.

　　敢闯禁区的行长
　　张鸿志
    如果只满足于“存款、贷款、结算”等传统业务，当银行行长可算是个较轻松的差事。但襄樊市工商银行行长赵有志这几年却扎扎实实地干了几件不轻松的事。
    曾几何时，科技战线被误认为只用钱、不生财的领域。科技贷款资金来源上无渠道，信贷种类上无规定，上级又没有规章制度，一向被视为银行信贷的禁区。
    １９８４年，赵有志一担任襄樊市工商银行行长，就想闯一闯这个禁区。这一年，在市委政府领导支持下，这家银行率先在全国建立“科技开发信用部”。当年８月，中国工商银行总行推广了襄樊的经验并决定在全国开办新产品和新技术开发贷款业务。到目前为止，襄樊市工商银行共发放近５０００万元科技贷款，支持了１５０多个科技项目，渗透到化工、电子、建材、纺织、机械和轻工等行业，已有８５％的项目投产见效，创产值１．３亿多元，增加利税近３０００万元。
    这几年，既要做到紧缩信贷，又要支持企业生产，如何解决这个矛盾？
    １９８６年春节刚过，赵有志和几个副行长分路深入部分县区调查，发现有的企业怕原材料涨价，超储备抢购原材料，搞起“备战备荒”；还有的重速度、轻效益，盲目生产，致使许多产品堆放在库房里……
    他及时向来银行调查的市长杨斌庆作了汇报。不久，襄樊成立了资金综合治理领导小组，从生产销售到储备流通，从清仓利库到建章建制，共清出有问题资金和商品７．５亿元，处理盘活６．７亿元。
    针对有些企业资金使用效益低下的状况，赵有志决定把银行机制引入企业，建立企业内部银行，让管钱的和用钱的都算资金损益账。
    目前在襄樊，一条由国家银行——企业内部银行——企业各核算单位三位一体的资金管理通道基本形成。
