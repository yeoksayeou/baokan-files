The "National Excellent Pop Singer" selection contest, organized by the Ministry of Culture, concluded on the evening of April 10th. Zhang Mi, Chen Rujia, Shen Xiaocen, Tengger, Jia Yan, Hang Tianqi, Yi Zaiti, Zhang Qiang, Zhou Hao, and Zhang Die were awarded "Excellent Singer" certificates.

The competition's artistic director, Ma Guangxing, believes that the contest to some extent reflects the current level of popular singers in China. However, audiences in Guangzhou, known as the "birthplace" of Chinese pop music, were greatly disappointed.

At the start of the competition, the 4,500 seats in the Guangzhou Sports Stadium were nearly full, but by the time the contest was halfway through, the audience had dwindled to only four-tenths of the original number.

Throughout the three-hour competition, the stage was almost entirely dominated by the "Northwest Wind," which is why the audience kept shouting, "Sing something good!"

Some music industry insiders believe that the audience's indifference is a warning sign for the pop music industry, indicating that the creation, performance, and stage production of popular music are still not very mature. It is reported that since last year, the attendance rate at Guangzhou's pop music venues has been generally declining. Experts believe this phenomenon is worth pondering.

### 流行歌星角逐五羊城　满台“西北风”观众不爱听

　　流行歌星角逐五羊城
　　满台“西北风”观众不爱听
    据新华社广州电　（记者钟玉明）由文化部主办的“全国流行歌曲优秀歌手”选拔赛１０日晚决出胜负。张咪、陈汝佳、沈小岑、腾格尔、贾燕、杭天祺、伊再提、张强、周皓、张蝶等获“优秀歌手”证书。
    比赛的演出总监马光星认为，比赛一定程度上代表了我国通俗歌手目前的水平。但作为国内流行歌曲“发祥地”的广州观众们却大失所望。
    这次比赛开始时，广州体育馆４５００个座位的观众席几乎爆满，但比赛进行到一多半时，观众也走得剩下了四成。
    在长达三个小时的比赛中，几乎满台都是“西北风”，难怪台下观众大喊“唱点好听好的！”
    音乐界一些人士认为，观众的冷落，是流行歌曲的危机信号，表明通俗音乐的创作、表演到舞台制作目前还不很成熟。据悉，自去年以来，广州通俗乐坛上，上座率都在普遍下跌。专家认为这种现象值得深思。
