According to materials from the World Food and Agriculture Organization, 98 percent of the land area in Arab countries is threatened by desertification. The global agricultural production losses due to desertification and its impacts amount to $260 billion annually. The cost of a twenty-year plan to combat desertification is estimated at approximately $45 billion per year.

Egypt's arable land covers 2.8 million hectares, which is 2.8 percent of Egypt's total area. While the proportion of arable land is increasing, the rate and quantity of this increase are insufficient to meet the annual population growth. Between 1961 and 1978, the per capita arable land in West Asian Arab countries decreased by 40 percent, from approximately 17 hectares per person to 3 hectares per person. As for grain cultivation, the area in 1979 was 8.9 million hectares, with a per capita share of less than 0.1 hectares, compared to the world average of 0.17 hectares per person.

The increase in livestock numbers has led to the desertification of grazing lands. Over half of Tunisia's pastures have been severely affected by desertification. Morocco faces a similar situation, with the same proportion of pastureland under the same degree of threat.

For dryland agriculture that relies on irrigation, incorrect irrigation methods have had adverse effects. These methods have caused soil salinization and waterlogging of large areas of fertile land. In recent years, excessive drilling of irrigation wells has led to a drop in groundwater levels and the drying up of some wells.

Regarding the deforestation of forests and trees, between 1961 and 1978, the reduction in forest and tree cover was as follows: the Gulf and Arabian Peninsula by 3.8 percent, Syria and Jordan by 18 percent, Iraq by 23 percent, and Lebanon by 20 percent.

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization report lists some human factors contributing to desertification, such as pressure from humans and animals on existing resources, inappropriate land use methods under increasing population pressure, and the introduction and application of new technologies.

The report emphasizes that fundamentally and comprehensively combating desertification means improving the environment, ensuring food security and self-sufficiency, and establishing a desirable balance between population and resources.

　　阿拉伯土地受到沙漠化威胁
　　居辛
    据世界粮农组织的材料说，阿拉伯国家面积的百分之九十八受到沙漠化的威胁，世界农业生产因沙漠化及其影响而造成的损失每年达二百六十亿美元，为期二十年的对付沙漠化计划的费用约为每年四十五亿美元。
    埃及的耕地面积为二百八十万公顷，占埃及全部面积的百分之二点八，耕地的比例在不断增加，但增加的幅度和数量不大，从而不能适应每年的人口增长。一九六一至一九七八年期间，西亚阿拉伯国家人均占有的耕地减少了百分之四十，使人均占有的耕地由大约百分之十七公顷降为百分之三公顷。至于粮食种植面积，一九七九年为八百九十万公顷，人均占有量少于百分之零点一公顷，而世界人均占有量为百分之零点一七公顷。
    牲畜头数的增加造成了牧场土地的沙漠化。突尼斯半数以上的牧场受到了严重的沙漠化的打击。摩洛哥同样比例的牧场土地正面临同样程度的沙漠化。
    至于干旱土地上依靠灌溉的农业，则因一些错误的灌溉方法而受到了影响。这些灌溉方法造成了土地的盐碱化，以及使大片肥沃土地泡在水里。过去几年过多地打灌溉井造成了地下水水位下降和某些井的水枯竭。
    关于对森林和树木的砍伐，一九六一至一九七八年，森林和树木覆盖面积减少的幅度为：海湾和阿拉伯半岛百分之三点八，叙利亚和约旦百分之十八，伊拉克百分之二十三，黎巴嫩百分之二十。
    联合国粮农组织的报告列举了造成沙漠化的一些人为因素，例如：人和动物对现有资源的压力，在日益增大的人口压力下采取一些不适当的利用土地的方式、方法，引进和运用新技术。
    报告强调指出，归根结蒂，认真地、全面地同沙漠化作斗争，意味着改善环境，食品得到保障、自给自足，也意味着确定人口与资源之间受人欢迎的平衡。
