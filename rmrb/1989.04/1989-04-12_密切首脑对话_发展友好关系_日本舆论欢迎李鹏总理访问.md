On the eve of Premier Li Peng's visit to Japan, some Japanese newspapers published editorials or commentaries welcoming Li Peng's visit to Japan to promote Sino-Japanese friendly relations.

Today's editorial in the *Asahi Shimbun* stated that exchanges between the two countries' leaders have become routine. Economic exchanges and personnel exchanges between the two countries have strengthened the bonds between them. It is hoped that through this visit and dialogue between government leaders, the relationship between the two countries will further develop.

The Japan External Trade Organization's *International Trade* today published an article stating that when Premier Li was Vice Premier, he had visited Japan. This time, he is accompanied by members of the government, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Commerce, and the State Planning Commission. It is hoped that through the talks between the two premiers, the economic cooperation between the two countries will be promoted in a comprehensive and multi-faceted direction.

Some newspapers believe that China adheres to the policy of opening up to the outside world with economic development as the main axis, which requires Japan's financial and technological cooperation. The two countries need to work together to ensure that the new yen loan program agreed upon during Prime Minister Takeshita's visit to China last August is implemented. One newspaper expressed the hope that Premier Li would explain China's policy of opening up to the outside world, how to maintain political stability, and the continuity of policies. It also hoped that the Japanese government would not be affected by domestic political changes and would maintain consistent diplomacy, taking a practical and active approach to issues arising in political and economic relations between the two countries from the perspective of developing Sino-Japanese friendly relations.

　　密切首脑对话　发展友好关系
　　日本舆论欢迎李鹏总理访问
    本报东京４月１１日电　记者孙东民报道：李鹏总理即将访问日本前夕，日本一些报纸发表社论或评论，欢迎李鹏总理为发展中日友好关系访问日本。
    今天《朝日新闻》的社论说，两国间政府首脑的往来已成经常之事，两国间的经济交流和人员往来加固了两国间联系的纽带，期待通过这次访问和政府领导人之间的对话，使两国的关系进一步向前发展。
    日本国际贸易促进协会的《国际贸易》报今天的一篇述评认为，李总理在担任副总理时曾访问过日本，这次访问又有外交、经贸、计委等政府成员随行，希望通过两国总理的会谈，为两国间的经济合作向多方面的、综合的方向发展起促进作用。
    还有的报纸认为，中国坚持以开发经济为主轴的对外开放路线，需要得到日本的资金、技术合作，中日两国需要共同作出努力，使去年８月竹下访华时约定的新的日元贷款计划纳入轨道。一家报纸表示，希望李总理能就中国的对外开放政策、如何保持政治的稳定性和政策的连续性进行说明，也希望日本政府不受国内政局变化的影响而保持外交的一贯性，从发展中日友好关系的立场出发，实际而积极地对待两国间在政治、经济关系中出现的问题。
