A slim volume titled "Bai Xia District Citizen's Guide to Life" has driven the anti-corruption efforts in Nanjing's Bai Xia District and has been well-received by the public.

Last July, Bai Xia District implemented administrative transparency, compiling policies and procedures related to household registration transfers, permit applications, housing repairs and management, childcare, and school enrollment into the "Bai Xia District Citizen's Guide to Life." This guide was distributed to grassroots units and various government agencies, enterprises, and institutions within the district. It was also widely publicized through display cases and bulletin boards, serving as a basis for the public to supervise government officials and protect their legal rights. The guide also added constraints for officials, effectively promoting the anti-corruption efforts in party and government agencies.

"Converting agricultural to non-agricultural household registration" is a challenging aspect of urban household management. Last year, after the nearly 40-year-old policy for converting agricultural to non-agricultural household registration was made public, the police stations and residents' committees disclosed the relevant policies and applicant information to the public. A resident evaluation committee, primarily composed of residents, thoroughly evaluated the applications. After multiple rounds of evaluation and no significant objections from the majority of residents, the applications were approved by the relevant departments and publicly announced. This year, 62-year-old mute Tong Ruoyuan, whose 85-year-old mother and wife Yang Xiuxia live in the countryside, faced many difficulties. In December last year, after public evaluation, Yang Xiuxia was approved for household registration. Residents said: Tong Ruoyuan has no money, no power, and cannot speak, his household registration was resolved through policy. The district approved 129 applications for converting agricultural to non-agricultural household registration last year, totaling 245 people, and there have been no objections from the public so far.

The "Citizen's Guide to Life" handed over the standard for fair treatment to the public, making government departments work directly under public supervision, changing the bureaucratic style of many agencies, and improving efficiency. Obtaining an individual business license used to require "visiting multiple temples, paying respects to many deities, and burning incense multiple times." Now, with the policy in hand, individuals can complete the process smoothly in a few days. Since the guide was published in July last year, the district has issued 554 individual business licenses, and not a single one was obtained through bribery. Zhihe Street resident Wang Xiuqing faced difficulties when applying for an individual business license in 1983. Last September, he used the "Bai Xia District Citizen's Guide to Life" to complete the procedures at the street office and quickly received his individual barber business license.

Residents of Bai Xia District say that now, when they encounter problems or difficulties, they naturally think to consult the guide. It clearly outlines what can and cannot be done and the procedures for various tasks, making it very useful.

### 白下区的《公民生活指南》

　　白下区的《公民生活指南》
    新华社记者　徐机玲　殷学成
    一本薄薄的《白下区公民生活指南》，推动了南京市白下区的廉政建设，受到群众欢迎。
    去年７月，白下区实行政务公开，将与群众息息相关、大家意见多的户口迁移，办领执照，房屋修缮、管理，小孩入托、上学等方面的政策规定、办事程序，以及主管单位的地址、电话号码、联系人姓名等编印成《白下区公民生活指南》，发到区属基层单位和各机关、企事业单位，并利用橱窗、黑板报广为宣传，使其成为群众监督政府办事人员和维护自己合法权益的依据。《白下区公民生活指南》也给办事人员增加了约束力，有效地促进了党政机关的廉政建设。
    “农转非”是城市户口管理工作中的难点。去年，封闭了近４０年的“农转非”户口审批政策公开后，派出所、居委会将这方面的政策规定，连同申请人情况，原原本本公之于众，再经以居民为主的群众评议小组认真评议，几上几下，直到绝大多数居民没有意见，才由主管部门审批后张榜公布。今年６２岁的哑人童如元，家中有８５岁高龄的母亲，长期生活在一起的妻子杨秀华户口在农村，给生活带来许多困难。去年１２月，经群众评议，杨秀华被批准入户。群众说：童如元一无钱，二无权，三不会讲话，给他解决户口靠的是政策。这个区去年按政策办理“农转非”户口１２９户，共２４５人，至今没有听到群众的异议。
    《公民生活指南》把秉公办事的尺码交给群众，政府部门直接在群众监督下工作，改变了许多机关的衙门作风，提高了办事效率。办个体户执照，过去“不知要进多少座庙，拜多少个菩萨，烧多少次香”。现在，群众手中有了政策，凭着它，几天时间就可顺利办好。自去年７月公布《指南》以来，全区已办理的５５４个个体工商营业执照，没有一个是靠请客送礼办成的。致和街住户王修琦，１９８３年申请个体营业执照时碰了钉子。去年９月，他拿着《白下区公民生活指南》到街道办手续，很快就领到了个体理发营业执照。
    白下区的市民说，现在有了问题，遇到困难，都自然会想到翻翻《指南》，哪些事能办，哪些事不能办，办事程序如何上面都写得明明白白，用场真不小。
