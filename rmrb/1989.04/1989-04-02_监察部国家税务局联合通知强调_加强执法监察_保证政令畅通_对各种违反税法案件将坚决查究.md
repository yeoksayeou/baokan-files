Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 1st.

The Supervision Department and the State Taxation Bureau recently issued a joint notice, requiring all levels of supervision and taxation departments to strengthen tax law enforcement supervision, seriously handle various cases of tax law violations, and promote the rule of law in taxation.

In response to the current situation where some local and departmental leaders abuse their power to interfere with the taxation departments' lawful tax collection, some unit leaders retaliate against those who expose their tax evasion behaviors, and even openly resist taxation, the notice requires all levels of taxation and supervision departments to focus their work on strengthening law enforcement supervision and ensuring the smooth implementation of policies. The notice emphasizes that for the aforementioned issues, taxation departments should promptly report to supervision departments, and supervision departments should conduct thorough investigations and serious handling. The notice points out that taxation department personnel should model the observance of national laws and work discipline. For a few tax officials who abandon principles, violate laws, and seek personal gain, all levels of taxation departments and supervision departments should investigate the facts and handle them seriously. For those who constitute crimes, they should be transferred to judicial organs for criminal responsibility.

The notice also requires taxation departments to strengthen the construction of their own teams, strictly implement the system of rewards and punishments, and resolutely remove those who are not qualified to work in the taxation department. The notice emphasizes that the taxation departments should strictly follow the principle of equal treatment of all taxpayers, and strictly prohibit the use of administrative power to interfere with the normal tax collection work.
