Xinhua News Agency, Islamabad, April 28th.

The Kabul regime has stated that Najibullah is willing to go to Pakistan at any time to negotiate with the leaders of the seven-party Mujahideen alliance.

Afghanistan's chargé d'affaires in Pakistan, Gudratullah Ahmadi, made this statement yesterday during an interview with the *Frontier Post* reporter.

He said that the Mujahideen "will not win the war in Afghanistan," but if the war continues, more Afghans will die. He said that continuing the bloodshed is a "tragedy we cannot afford."

The Kabul regime has repeatedly proposed negotiations with the Mujahideen to resolve differences, but these proposals have all been rejected.

　　喀布尔政权再次表示
    愿同阿游击队谈判
    新华社伊斯兰堡４月２８日电  喀布尔政权表示纳吉布拉随时愿意到巴基斯坦同游击队７党联盟领导人谈判。
    阿富汗驻巴基斯坦临时代办古德拉图拉·阿赫马迪昨天接受《边疆邮报》记者采访时作出了这一表示。
    他说，游击队“不会在阿富汗战争中获胜”，但如战争继续下去，更多的阿富汗人将会丧命。他说，继续流血是个“我们承受不起的悲剧”。
    喀布尔政权曾多次提议同游击队谈判解决分歧，但均遭拒绝。
