	Anthropologists' latest research indicates that Tibetans and other regions' Han and ethnic minorities all originate from late Homo sapiens represented by the Zhoukoudian Mountain Top people in northern China.

	Researchers from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, through studying the new stone-age human bones found in the Linzhi region of Tibet, modern Tibetan skull features, and continuous research on modern Tibetan physical traits, have discovered that the physical traits of Tibetans are closest to those of minorities and Han people in northern and northwestern China. Tibetans evolved from the ancient residents of the new stone-age in Tibet, and through continuous migration and mixing with ancient residents of northern China, gradually formed the modern Tibetan physical type.

	There have been many debates about the origin of Tibetans. Some believe that Tibetans originate from the ancient Qiang people in the west; some believe that Tibetans originate from the Shakya dynasty in India; and some propose that Tibetans originate from the ancient residents of the Yarlung Zangbo River basin, i.e., the ancestors of Tibetans originated from Tibet itself.

	Recently, Zhang Zhenbiao, an associate researcher from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, through studying the micro-stone tool culture discovered in Tibet and the new stone-age human bones discovered in 1957 at the confluence of the Yarlung Zangbo River and the Nyang River in Linzhi, inferred that humans had already labored and lived in the Tibet region during the new stone age. The Linzhi skull belongs to the modern human type of the Mongoloid race.

	He explained to the reporter today that Tibetans are mainly developed from the ancient residents of the new stone age in Tibet. However, with the development of history and the migration of people, the ancient Mongoloid people in the northern region gradually expanded southward and westward, with some entering Tibet and continuously interbreeding with the local residents, eventually forming the modern Tibetans.

	He said, from the perspective of height, the height of Tibetan males is of the super-medium type, with most being above 1.67 meters, comparable to the height of Han people in northern China, northeastern China, and Shaanxi. From the analysis of head and facial features, Tibetans have relatively black hair, relatively straight and hard hair texture; eye color is mostly brown; the nasal bridge is relatively straight, and the nostrils are oval-shaped; the lips are of medium thickness, with a slightly protruding shape; the cheekbones are prominent, and the face is wide and flat; body hair is sparse. From these characteristics, Tibetans are undoubtedly of the East Asian type of modern Chinese people—the yellow race.

	It is also understood that recently, the Shanghai Blood Research Institute's analysis of the immune globulin isoantigen factors in blood also indicates that Tibetans and residents of northwestern, northern, and northeastern China belong to the same type.

### 人类学家发现　山顶洞人是藏族汉族共同祖先

　　人类学家发现
　　山顶洞人是藏族汉族共同祖先
    新华社北京电　（记者李希光）人类学家的最新研究表明，西藏人与其他地区的汉族和少数民族都源于以北京周口店山顶洞人为代表的中国北部的晚期智人。
    中国科学院古脊椎动物与古人类研究所的研究人员通过对西藏林芝地区发现的新石器时代人骨、现代西藏人头骨特征，以及对现代藏族体征的连续研究发现，藏族的体质特征与中国华北、西北地区的少数民族和汉族最接近。藏族是从西藏地区新石器时代居民发展而来，经华北古代居民的不断迁入和混杂，逐渐形成今日的藏族体质类型。
    关于藏族的来源曾有过不少争论。有人认为藏族源于西羌；有人认为藏族源于印度释迦王系；也有人提出藏族源于雅鲁藏布江流域的古代居民，即藏族祖先起源于西藏本土。
    不久前，中科院古脊椎与古人类所的张振标副研究员通过对西藏发现的细石器文化及１９５７年在雅鲁藏布江和尼洋河汇流处的林芝村发现的新石器时代人骨研究推论，人类早在新石器时代已经劳动、生息于西藏地区。林芝人颅骨属于蒙古人种现代人类型。
    他今天向记者介绍这项研究时解释说，西藏藏族是由西藏新石器时代的古代居民为主体发展而来的。但是，后来随着历史的发展和人群的迁移，北部地区古代蒙古人种逐渐向南部和西南部扩展，其中有一部分进入西藏，并与当地居民不断混血，最后形成今日的藏族。
    他说，从身高看，藏族男性的身高属超中等型，其中多数在一点六七米以上，与华北、东北和陕西等地汉族人身高相当。从头面部容貌特征分析，藏族人头发较黑，发型较直较硬；眼色多为褐色；鼻梁较直，鼻孔卵圆型；中等唇厚，唇形稍凸；颧骨突出，面部宽而扁平；体毛稀少。从这些特征判断，藏族无疑属于现代中国人——黄种人的东亚类型。
    另据了解，不久前，上海市输血研究所关于血液中的免疫球蛋白同种异型因子分析结果也表明，藏族人与西北、华北、东北的居民同属于一个类型。
