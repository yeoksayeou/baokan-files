In recent years, I have been working as a journalist in the Soviet Union. During various activities organized by the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, I often saw an elderly man of short stature, thin face, but loud voice and vigorous spirit. He is retired Soviet military colonel Alexander Zhelvakov.

Zhelvakov always liked to wear various medals and badges on his chest, standing tall and straight, displaying the bold demeanor of an old soldier. During the Great Patriotic War, he was wounded multiple times and received many honors. He participated in the final battles against the Japanese invaders in Northeast China. He has left an unforgettable impression of the diligence and bravery of the Chinese people.

I gave him a 1989 calendar with Chinese landscapes. He put on his glasses and carefully flipped through each page. Looking at the pictures, he was so moved that tears welled up in his eyes. He said, "Here are the mountains and rivers I am familiar with. I want to show them to my wife and son, and to my grandson..." The old man told me that through the ups and downs of the past few decades, his friendly feelings towards the Chinese people have remained unchanged. He asked me to convey his greetings to Chinese readers: May China welcome prosperity and prosperity on the road of reform.

To express his long-standing affection, Alexander Zhelvakov specially wrote "Accompanying the Last Emperor for Two Days and Nights" for the Chinese "People's Daily." Despite being 71 years old, he personally delivered the manuscript to me from his home in the Moscow suburbs, traveling for more than two hours in the icy winter of Russia.

Below is an excerpt from the article.

On August 19, 1945, when the battles against the Japanese invaders had not yet completely subsided, 225 Soviet paratroopers landed in Shenyang, China. However, they encountered an unexpected event: during a search of the airport, they discovered the puppet emperor of Manchukuo, Puyi, and his entourage, who were hiding there waiting for a plane to escape.

The last emperor was taken from Shenyang to Tongliao, and the higher-ups assigned me to guard him. The military order from the command was brief and stern: "Lieutenant Zhelvakov, you must guarantee Puyi's life with your own head! Two more soldiers will assist you."

At first, I felt a bit confused: after all, he was an "emperor"! However, an order is an order.

We placed the "emperor" and his entourage in a secluded house, surrounded by a solid wall. The situation in the city was extremely tense, and anything could happen at any moment, so we kept a close eye on Puyi and his group. The house where they were detained was under strict surveillance.

At the beginning, the "emperor" was in a state of despair, feeling uneasy and often stealing glances at us in fear, his heavy, thick-framed glasses unable to hide the pallor of his face. He couldn't sleep at night, and a servant was always by his side.

On the morning of August 20, General K. Feriashe, the political department chief of the 6th Tank Guards Army, arrived. He ordered that food be sent to Puyi and his entourage and required us to treat the "emperor" and his party with courtesy. That day, the weather was fine, and we decided to let our "guards" enjoy some fresh air in the courtyard.

Soon, a Soviet interpreter arrived. At this point, Puyi became more active and began to speak urgently to the interpreter. Later, I learned that the "emperor" was surprised by the courtesy and careful attention of the guards and admitted that this was beyond his expectations.

After lunch, we escorted Puyi and his entourage to Tamchak-Bulak in Mongolia, where an old plane was dispatched. To be prepared for any eventuality, we brought an anti-aircraft machine gun. At this point, Puyi was composed, looking out the window for a long time, sometimes chatting with his companions. An outsider might think he was on his way home after a trip. In Mongolia, they changed to another plane and then flew directly to the headquarters of the Soviet Far Eastern Army in the suburbs of Chita.

By this time, my mission to guard the "highest ruler" of the puppet Manchukuo had been completed. When I returned to Shenyang, I learned that Japan had unconditionally surrendered. At that time, I did not realize that in 1946, during the Tokyo trial of the main Japanese war criminals, Puyi would become an important witness.

　　陪伴末代皇帝两昼夜
    李惠生
    近年，我在苏联任记者，在苏中友协举办的各种活动中，时常看见一位身材不高、面容清瘦，但声音洪亮、精神矍铄的老人。他是苏军退休中校亚历山大·热尔瓦科夫。
    热尔瓦科夫总喜欢把各种勋章、奖章佩带胸前，昂首挺立，表现出一位老军人的豪爽风姿。卫国战争期间他多次负伤立功。他参加过在中国东北最后击溃日本侵略军的战斗。他对中国人民的勤劳、勇敢，留下了终生难忘的美好回忆。
    我把一本印有中国风景的１９８９年年历送给他。他戴上老花镜仔细地一页页翻阅。他看着画面，激动得热泪盈眶，说：“这里有我熟悉的山山水水，我要带给老伴儿和儿子去看，给孙子去看……”老人告诉我，在几十年的风风雨雨中，他对中国人民的友好之情始终如一。他嘱我寄语中国读者：祝中国在改革的大道上迎来繁荣昌盛。
    为了表达他久远的深情，亚历山大·热尔瓦科夫专为中国《人民日报》撰写了“陪伴末代皇帝两昼夜”这篇短文。他还不顾７１岁高龄，在俄罗斯冬日的冰天雪地中，从莫斯科郊区住所，途经两个多小时，将文稿亲自送到我的手上。
    以下是这篇文章的摘译。
    １９４５年８月１９日，当同日本侵略者的战斗尚未完全平息下来的时候，２２５名苏联伞兵在中国沈阳市空降。此时，他们却遇到了一件意外之事：搜查机场时发现了伪满洲国的傀儡皇帝溥仪和他的随行人员，他们正躲在那里等候飞机，准备逃跑。
    末代皇帝被从沈阳押送至通辽后，上级派我看守他。司令部的军事命令简短而严峻：“热尔瓦科夫少尉，您要用自己的头颅为溥仪的性命做担保！再派两名战士协助您。”
    开始，我感到几分惶惑：不管怎么说，这是一位“皇帝”呀！然而命令就是命令。
    我们把“皇帝”和他的随行人员安置在一所幽僻的平房里，平房的四周是严严实实的围墙。城里的形势极度紧张，随时都有可能发生意外，因此我们目不转睛地盯着溥仪一伙。囚禁他们的房子处在严密的监视之下。
    开始，“皇帝”的心境沮丧，局促不安，不时惊恐地偷看我们几眼，沉重厚实的牛角眼镜框也掩盖不住他面孔的苍白。他夜不能寐，一名仆人始终伴随着他。
    ８月２０日清晨，第６坦克近卫军政治部主任克·费里亚什舍将军到来。他命令给溥仪及其随员送饭，并且要求我们对“皇帝”一行彬彬有礼。那天，天气晴好，我们决定让自己的“被监护者”们在内院的新鲜空气中散散心。
    不久，一名苏军翻译来到。此时，溥仪明显地活跃起来，开始急促地对翻译说话。后来我才知道，原来“皇帝”对警卫队待他以礼遇并悉心照顾颇感惊讶，他承认这是他始料未及的。
    午饭后，我们送溥仪一行去蒙古的塔木察格布拉克市，派来的是一架有了相当年头儿的旧飞机。为了防备万一，我们带上了一挺高射机枪。此时的溥仪举止安详，久久望着舷窗，有时还于同伴们交谈两句。局外人一眼看去，可能以为他是在旅行之后返家途中。在蒙古又换了一架飞机，然后直飞苏联赤塔市郊区的苏军远东部队司令部。
    至此，我看守伪满洲国“最高统治者”的使命已告完成。之后，我回到沈阳时才得知日本已无条件投降。当时我没有想到，１９４６年在东京审判日本主要战犯时，溥仪会成为重要的人证。
