The Ministry of Public Security held a report meeting today, calling on the entire public security system nationwide to launch a campaign to learn from the "First-Class Hero Model" Liang Xuechang, who sacrificed his life.

Liang Xuechang was a detective from the Zhangdian Branch of the Public Security Bureau of Zibo City, Shandong Province. On December 23, 1988, while capturing a major thief wanted by the Beijing Public Security Bureau, Liang Xuechang, despite suffering nine wounds to his head and neck and having his aorta severed, continued to fight fiercely with the criminal. Unfortunately, he sacrificed his life at the young age of 23. Before his death, Liang Xuechang had captured 357 criminals and had been commended three times.
