The Girls Who Brought Home the Corbillon Cup
— Sketches of the Chinese Women's Table Tennis Team Members

Chen Jing – "Matured"

Over the past half year, Chen Jing has changed. Overnight after the Olympics, she went from being a relatively unknown young player to a nationwide star. Flowers, praise, endless interviews, and social activities have worn away much of the innocent and cheerful personality of this 20-year-old girl from Wuhan. Even her hairstyle has become more "mature."

Being a celebrity is not easy. At the beginning of this year, Chen Jing participated in the Asia-Europe Match, and after losing two games, she faced a lot of criticism. She simply couldn't handle it all. During the training in Huangshi, there was a period when her mood was very bad. However, she quickly regained control of herself.

With the World Table Tennis Championships approaching, Chen Jing was naturally put in the starting lineup. In the previous competition, she also participated in the team event, but she was just a supporting player. In the two tough matches against Czechoslovakia and South Korea, she faced difficulties, even losing the first set to Hong Sun-hwa. But she remained calm and composed, showing the demeanor of a seasoned player, ultimately performing at her best and securing victory.

When she stood on the podium to receive the team world championship award, Chen Jing's furrowed brow, which had been tight for many days, finally relaxed, and she smiled confidently, no longer showing the shy expression from the previous competition.

Li Hui Fen – Late Bloomer

20:21, just one point away from losing to South Korea's main player Hyun Jeong-a. The tension was so high that it made everyone's heart race.

The 26-year-old Hebei woman Li Hui Fen is a late bloomer. She and Qi Baoxiang, Geng Lijuan, and other famous players are from the same generation of teammates. However, she only became a key player for the Chinese team in the past two or three years.

Li Hui Fen is tall and slender, with a fragile physique. She has a steady and tenacious personality, doing everything calmly and patiently. Zhang Xianlin, who has been the women's team coach for many years, knows Li Hui Fen well. He said, "Watching Li Hui Fen play, it's more nerve-wracking outside the court than inside. She often makes people so anxious that they almost get heart disease before she wins."

Indeed, Li Hui Fen, with her solid straight-paddle fundamentals, fought with Hyun Jeong-a. With her tenacious spirit, she fought back to 23:21, winning the second set and then the third, scoring the first point for the Chinese women's team.

Chen Zi He – The Unpredictable Player

Chen Zi He, known as the "unpredictable player," comes from Minqing County, Fujian. She exudes the charm and efficiency of a southern girl.

Chen is 21 years old and has been playing table tennis for 11 years. She originally used a straight-paddle fast-attack style with positive rubber, but later switched to a long-paddle style. Initially, she was reluctant, but later she found it effective. In the past, long-paddle players were good at defense but not at attack. Chen Zi He, however, after mastering defensive techniques such as blocking and chopping, also developed a powerful smashing technique, making her both a strong attacker and defender with a varied playing style.

In this team final, Chen had a strong desire to compete. She was disappointed not to play singles, but she didn't show it, channeling all her energy into doubles. As soon as she and Li Hui Fen took the court, they displayed an overwhelming presence. Her unpredictable returns left the opponents at a loss, also deflating the South Korean cheerleaders. Together, they secured the final point for the Chinese team.

Hu Xiaoxin – Showing Her Potential

Hu Xiaoxin is also from Hubei. She has a square face and short hair, looking like a boy. Her personality and playing style are both masculine. Her teammates know that Xiaoxin is straightforward and her playing style is aggressive.

She uses a straight-paddle reverse rubber loop attack style. Her forehand shots are both spinny and powerful, and her backhand can also lift the ball, which is rare among female athletes. In this team competition, Xiaoxin didn't play much, and her opponents weren't very strong. Whether she played or not, she always prepared thoroughly and maintained good competitive condition.

At 23, Hu Xiaoxin's best personal achievement was winning the Asian Cup. Due to the abundance of talent in the Chinese women's team, Xiaoxin, like Chen Jing two years ago, has yet to fully reveal her talents. During the award ceremony, she quickly slipped to the side. She is waiting for the opportunity to shine in the individual events.

### 捧回考比伦杯的中国姑娘——中国乒乓女队团体赛队员素描

　　捧回考比伦杯的中国姑娘
    ——中国乒乓女队团体赛队员素描
    陈静——“老成”了
    这半年，陈静变了。奥运会一夜之间，她从一个名气不大的小将成为举国瞩目的明星。鲜花、赞誉声、没完没了的各种采访和社会活动，把这位刚满２０岁的武汉姑娘的天真烂漫性格磨去大半，她连头发式样也变得“老成”了。
    名人真不好当。陈静今年初参加亚欧对抗赛，稍不顺手，输了两盘球，便招来一片议论。她简直受不了这一切，在黄石集训期间有一段她情绪很不好。不过她很快控制住自己。
    世乒赛来临，陈静理所当然地被推上主力位置。上届比赛她也参加了团体赛，但仅是跑跑龙套而已。对捷克斯洛伐克队和南朝鲜队两场硬仗中，她都一度遇到困难，对洪顺花甚至先失一局。但她不慌不乱，显出大将风度，最终还是打出水平、取得胜利。
    登上团体世界冠军领奖台时，陈静紧皱了好多日子的眉头又舒展开，大大方方地笑了，再没有露出上届时那种不好意思的神情。
    李惠芬——大器晚成
    ２０∶２１，差１分李惠芬就要输给南朝鲜主力玄静和了，紧张得让人把心吊在嗓子眼里。
    ２６岁的河北女将李惠芬，大器晚成，她和齐宝香、耿丽娟等名手本是同一时代的队友。然而她真正成为中国队主力不过是最近两三年的事。
    李惠芬个子高高瘦瘦，体质显得纤弱，她性格稳重，韧性极好，干什么事都不紧不慢。当了多年女队教练的张燮林十分了解李惠芬，他说：“看李惠芬比赛，场外比场内着急，她常常把人折腾得快得心脏病才拿下来。”
    果然，李惠芬凭着自己雄厚的直拍基本功与玄静和周旋，她以牛皮糖般的韧劲，打到２３∶２１，扳回第二局，又拿下第三局，为中国女队打响头炮。
    陈子荷——怪球手
    被称为“怪球手”的陈子荷，来自福建闽清县，看上去浑身透着南国姑娘的那股灵气和干练劲。
    小陈今年２１岁，球龄已有１１年。她原是直拍正胶快攻打法，后改为长胶打法。起初她有点不情愿，后来却打出甜头。过去的长胶拍选手，善守不善攻。而陈子荷在练好挡、削等防守技术基础上，又练出一手抽杀技术，能攻善守，球路多变。
    这次团体决战，小陈求战欲望很强，没让她打单打她心里挺遗憾，只是没表现出来，把憋着的劲全用到双打上。她和李惠芬一上场，就显示出压倒对方的气势。她那变幻莫测的回球令对手一筹莫展，也令南朝鲜拉拉队泄了气。她俩密切配合为中国队拿下最后一分。
    胡小新——初露锋芒
    胡小新也是湖北姑娘，方方的脸庞、短短的头发像个男孩子。她的性格和打法也都带有男子味道。队友们都知道，小新为人爽朗，球风泼辣。
    她是直拍反胶弧圈快攻打法，正手球又转又冲，反手也能起板，这在女运动员中不多见。本届团体赛，小新出场不太多，对手也不很强，她不管上场不上场都认真做好准备活动，保持良好的竞技状态。
    ２３岁的胡小新个人以前最好成绩是荣获亚洲杯冠军。由于中国女队人才济济，小新正像两年前的陈静一样，才华尚未完全显露出来。发奖仪式，她很快悄悄躲到一边，她在等待着单项比赛一显身手的机会。
