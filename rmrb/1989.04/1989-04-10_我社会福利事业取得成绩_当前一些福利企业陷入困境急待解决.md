The People's Daily reported from Beijing on April 8 that the Ministry of Civil Affairs has released figures indicating that China's civil affairs in 1988 had both achievements and concerns.

The spokesperson from the Ministry of Civil Affairs stated that in 1988, 18.27% of townships in China established social welfare systems, including elderly care homes, social welfare factories, and comprehensive care for the five guarantees, totaling over 10,000 such institutions. In urban and rural areas, 39,030 new welfare institutions were built, an increase of 1,658 compared to the previous year. Additionally, 40,496 welfare enterprises were established in 1988, employing 1,476,000 workers, which is an increase of 45.71% and 29.61% respectively compared to the previous year. The total output value reached 20.63 billion yuan, with a profit of 1.66 billion yuan. Social welfare enterprises have over 20 major categories and 1,500 types of products exported, earning 240 million US dollars in foreign exchange, a 200% increase compared to the previous year. Last year, 659,000 disabled individuals were placed in concentrated employment, and 91,300 were employed in street-based scattered employment, representing increases of 51.74% and 32.78% respectively compared to the previous year.

The spokesperson from the Ministry of Civil Affairs also mentioned that despite these achievements, there are still concerning issues. Social welfare enterprises are facing the impact of price increases in non-planned raw materials, and even with national preferential tax policies, 20% of these enterprises are still at risk of operating at a loss or closing down. In the process of optimizing the labor force and implementing the contract responsibility system, disabled individuals are often the first to be laid off, making the employment problem even more pronounced.

　　我社会福利事业取得成绩
    当前一些福利企业陷入困境急待解决
    本报北京４月８日讯  民政部新闻发言人今天公布的数字表明：我国１９８８年民政事业的发展喜中带忧。
    民政部发言人说，１９８８年，我国１８．２７％的乡镇建立了以敬老院、社会福利厂、优待五保统筹和社会保障网络，总数达到１万多个。城乡新建福利院３９０３０个，比上年增加１６５８个。同时，１９８８年还创办福利企业４０４９６个，有职工１４７．６万人，分别比上年增加４５．７１％和２９．６１％，创产值达２０６．３亿元，获利１６．６亿元。社会福利企业还有２０多个大类，１５００多个品种产品出口，创汇２．４亿美元，比上年增长２００％。去年集中安置残疾人就业６５．９万人，街道分散就业９．１３万人，分别比上年增长５１．７４％和３２．７８％。
    民政部发言人说，在取得成绩的背后，仍存在着令人担忧的问题。社会福利企业因受计划外原材料价格上涨的冲击，在享受国家优惠税收的政策下，仍有２０％企业面临亏损或倒闭的危险；在优化劳动组合、推行承包制中，首先被淘汰的是残疾人，因此就业难的问题更加突出。
