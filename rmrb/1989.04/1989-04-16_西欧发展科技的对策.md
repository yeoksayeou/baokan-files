Through increased investment in scientific research and continuous enhancement of industrial innovation capabilities over the past few years, the state of science and technology in Europe has improved. However, it still lags behind the United States and Japan and faces challenges from other countries. The total research expenditure of the European Community is lower than that of the United States, and its proportion of the gross national product is lower than that of the United States and Japan. The investment of industrial enterprises and the economic sector in the United States and Japan in scientific research far exceeds that of Western Europe. The proportion of scientific researchers and engineering technicians in the total employment in the United States and Japan is also higher than that in Western Europe. By the year 2010, the United States may face a shortage of 500,000 scientific and technological personnel, and it will vigorously encourage foreign university graduates to work in the United States, which will exacerbate the loss of talent in Western Europe.

In the Soviet Union, military research is being shifted towards civilian use, and its theoretical mathematics, aerospace, new materials, fifth-generation computer research, and molecular biology have a solid foundation. The potential of its science and technology should not be underestimated.

Emerging industrial countries and regions are considering investing more in research funds and cultivating high-quality research personnel in multiple fields. This not only poses a challenge to Western Europe in traditional industries (textiles, steel, shipbuilding, transportation, etc.) but also in high-tech fields (consumer electronics, information, microelectronics, aerospace, and aviation technology). Because the labor costs in these countries are low, their technological strength has been enhanced. These countries are like adding wings to a tiger.

Faced with these challenges, Western Europe has formulated strategies and taken actions. Firstly, Western Europe has set three major tasks for its technological development: enhancing international competitiveness, improving public living standards, and emphasizing basic research. The five key research areas are information technology and communications, industrial new materials and process technologies, aerospace technology, biological sciences, and energy technology.

Currently, although Western Europe's information technology has improved since the early 1980s, it has a significant trade deficit in this industry, reaching $13.4 billion in 1986. The main weakness is in electronic components. Therefore, Europe is concentrating its efforts on developing the next generation of integrated circuits with 0.5-micron structures. European electronic manufacturers are planning a transnational JESSI (European Joint European Submicron Silicon Initiative) project. The focus of new materials research is on quality control technology, forming technology, bonding and component assembly, surface treatment, rust prevention and corrosion, and superconducting materials. The aerospace industry will comprehensively conduct research in aerodynamics, precision machinery, materials, acoustics, and other fields. Develop the application of brain science and biotechnology in industrial and agricultural industrialization. In the energy sector, strengthen research on controlled nuclear fusion and non-nuclear energy technologies, as well as the rational use of energy.

Western Europe has also formulated some key science and technology policies. For example, balancing the emphasis and efforts on basic research and applied research, encouraging entrepreneurs to support basic research, strengthening the connection between industrial enterprises and universities, increasing the demand for knowledge and skills, that is, talent, improving the working environment, and removing various obstacles to the mobility of scientific researchers between Western European countries; encouraging private enterprises to increase industrial investment and research investment, vigorously promoting scientific and technological achievements, and quickly bringing research results to the market; and organizing international cooperation.

Europe has great potential in science and technology and has strong economic strength. Their efforts to catch up will yield results.

　　西欧发展科技的对策
　　胡仲华
    通过前几年加强科研投资和不断增强工业的创新能力，欧洲科技的状况有所改善，但是，它仍然落后于美国和日本，而且面临其他一些国家的挑战。欧共体的科研总支出低于美国，它占国民生产总值的百分数低于美国和日本。美国和日本的工业企业及经济界自身对科研的投资远远超过西欧，美国及日本的科研人员和工程技术人员在总就业人员中所占的比例也高于西欧。美国到二○一○年可能缺少五十万科技人员，它将大力鼓励外国大学毕业生去美国工作，这将加剧了西欧人才的流失。
    在苏联，军用科研正在转向民用，而且它的理论数学、航天、新材料、第五代计算机研究及分子生物学的基础很好，科技潜力不可低估。
    新兴工业国家和地区正在考虑投入更多的科研费用和培养多领域及高质量的科研人员。这样，不仅在传统工业（纺织、钢铁、造船、交通业等），而且在高技术领域（家用电子、信息、微电子、航天及航空技术）也对西欧构成竞争。因为，新兴工业国家和地区的劳动力费用低，提高了技术实力。这些国家就如虎添翼。
    面对上述挑战，西欧已经制定对策，采取行动。首先，西欧为其科技发展确定的三大任务是，加强国际竞争能力、提高公众生活质量和重视基础研究，确定的五个重点研究领域是信息技术及通讯、工业用新材料及工艺技术、航空技术、生物科学及能源技术。
    目前，西欧信息技术虽然比八十年代初有了进步，但是它在该行业的贸易逆差很大，一九八六年达一百三十四亿美元，主要的薄弱环节是电子元件。为此，欧洲在集中力量开发的零点五微米结构的下一代集成芯片。欧洲各国电子行业制造商正酝酿一个跨国的ＪＥＳＳＩ（欧洲联合亚微米硅片）项目。新材料研究的重点是：质量监控技术、成形技术、粘接及工件装配、表面处理、除锈防蚀以及超导材料。航空工业将综合进行航空动力学、精密机械、材料、声学等方面的研究。开发人脑科学和生物技术在工业和农业工业化方面的应用。在能源方面，加强受控核聚合研究和非核能源技术及合理使用能源的研究。
    西欧还制定了一些关键的科技政策。例如，对基础研究及应用研究的重视和努力程度，保持一定的平衡，企业家资助基础研究，加强工业企业和大学之间的联系，还将增加对知识和能力，即人才的需求，改善工作环境，消除西欧各国之间科研人员流动的种种障碍；鼓励私营企业增加工业投资和科研投资，大力推广科技成果，尽快使科研成果进入市场；组织好国际合作。
    欧洲有很大的科技潜力，又具有较强的经济实力，它们的追赶努力是会取得成果的。
