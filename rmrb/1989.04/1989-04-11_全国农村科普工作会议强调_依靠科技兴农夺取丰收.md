More than 100 advanced collectives and individuals in science popularization work from across the country, as well as science and technology entrepreneurs who actively promote scientific and technological knowledge, attended the eighth National Rural Science Popularization Conference held by the China Association for Science and Technology today. The conference focused on studying how to contribute to achieving bumper harvests in agriculture over the next two years.

Deng Jiaqian, Song Jian, Chen Junsheng, and Qian Xuesen attended the meeting. Vice Chairman of the China Association for Science and Technology, He Kang, delivered a report.

He Kang emphasized that achieving bumper harvests in agriculture is difficult without the active participation of science and technology. The key to current rural science popularization work is to strive to improve the quality of the broad masses of farmers, enhancing their enthusiasm for adopting new technologies and their ability to absorb new technologies. Continuing to promote practical technology training should be an important component in driving agricultural progress and increasing investment in agricultural science and technology.

He Kang said that currently, many places are seeing a resurgence of feudal superstitions and other forms of ignorance. He stressed that science popularization work should combine the eradication of poverty with the eradication of ignorance, fully utilizing various academic and science popularization organizations and media such as newspapers, radio, television, and film to improve the scientific and cultural literacy, labor skills, and management levels of the broad masses of farmers, pushing rural science popularization work to a new stage.

State Councilor Song Jian also spoke at the meeting. He proposed that the starting point and ultimate goal of science popularization work is to develop rural productivity and promote social progress. It is necessary to popularize scientific knowledge and practical technologies, promote rural scientific and technological progress, provide series of technical services, develop intellectual resources, and promote the development of a commodity economy.

Currently, 99% of counties in the country have established county-level science associations, and 83% of townships have established township-level science popularization associations, with over 4 million members. Rural professional technical research associations are thriving, with approximately 90,000 nationwide. Large-scale practical technology training is underway, with over 120 million people trained nationwide, including 2 million farmers who have reached the level of technical personnel. The Chinese Farmers' Correspondence University has established over 220 branch schools with more than 100,000 students enrolled. This vast force has become an important driving force for promoting rural science popularization work and advancing rural economic development and scientific and technological progress.

　　全国农村科普工作会议强调
　　依靠科技兴农夺取丰收
    本报北京４月１０日讯　记者何黄彪报道：来自全国的１００多个科普工作先进集体和先进个人，以及积极传播科学技术的科技致富能手，今天参加了中国科协召开的第八次全国农村科普工作会议，着重研究当前农村科普工作如何为夺取今明两年农业丰收作出贡献的问题。
    田纪云、宋健、陈俊生、钱学森等出席会议。中国科协副主席何康作了报告。
    何康强调指出，要夺取农业丰收，没有科学技术的积极参与是难以实现的。当前农村科普工作的关键是努力提高广大农民群众的素质，提高他们采用新技术的积极性和消化新技术的能力。要把实用技术培训继续作为推动农业进步、增加对农业科技投入的一项重要内容。
    何康说，当前许多地方封建迷信等愚昧的东西又有所抬头。他强调，科普工作要把治贫和治愚结合起来，充分发挥各种学术、科普组织和报刊、广播、电视、电影等传播手段的作用，提高广大农民的科学文化素质、劳动技能和经营管理水平，把农村科普工作推向新阶段。
    国务委员宋健也在会议上讲了话。他提出：发展农村生产力和促进社会进步是科普工作的出发点和归宿，要普及科学知识和实用技术，推动农村科技进步，做好系列化技术服务，开发智力资源，促进商品经济的发展。
    目前，全国已有９９％的县建立了县科协，８３％的乡建立了乡镇科普协会，拥有会员４００多万人。农村专业技术研究会方兴未艾，全国已有９万个左右。实用技术培训大规模展开，全国累计已培训１．２亿人，其中有２００万农民达到了技术员水平。中国农民函大已建立了２２０多所分校，在校学员１０万多人。这支浩荡的大军，已成为开展农村科普工作和促进农村经济发展、科技进步的一支重要力量。
