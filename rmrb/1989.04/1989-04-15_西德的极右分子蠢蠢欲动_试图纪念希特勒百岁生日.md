West German police and security agencies have been closely monitoring the activities of approximately 25,000 far-right extremists, particularly the 1,500 most hardcore neo-Nazi elements, in recent times. According to intelligence reports, right-wing extremists plan to hold "commemorative" activities on April 20, which marks the 100th birthday of the Nazi leader Hitler.

According to evidence gathered by West German security agencies, neo-Nazi and neo-fascist elements from many European countries are also planning to hold commemorative activities. The core members of the right-wing forces have declared their intention to hold a rally in Spain.

In recent regional elections in West Germany, right-wing forces have shown signs of resurgence, securing 6.6% of the vote in Frankfurt.

The news agency also noted that in the 1970s, West Germany experienced a wave of Hitler commemoration, with numerous books and films being published and released. Currently, two-thirds of West Germans have little to no memory of the facts surrounding Hitler's initiation of World War II, or have only a vague understanding. Many children imagine the "Führer" as a "benevolent figure."

　　西德的极右分子蠢蠢欲动
　　试图纪念希特勒百岁生日
    本报讯　据德通社报道，联邦德国的警察和安全部门近一时期来密切注视着２．５万名极右分子，尤其是其中１５００名最顽固的新纳粹分子的活动。根据情报部门的预计，４月２０日纳粹头子希特勒的百岁生日时，右翼分子将举行“纪念”活动。
    据西德安全部门掌握的证据，很多欧洲国家的新纳粹分子和新法西斯分子届时将举行纪念活动。右翼势力的“铁杆”分子扬言要在西班牙集会。
    在最近的西德地区选举中，右翼势力有所抬头。在法兰克福得票６．６％。
    这家通讯社还指出，７０年代西德曾出现过一股纪念希特勒的逆流，出版了大量书刊，还发行了电影。目前西德２／３的人对希特勒发动的第二次世界大战的史实毫无记忆，或只有模糊的概念。很多儿童想象“元首”是位“慈善家”。
