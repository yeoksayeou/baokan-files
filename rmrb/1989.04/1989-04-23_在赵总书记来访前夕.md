In the days leading up to the visit of CPC Central Committee General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, Pyongyang is in full bloom with flowers, and the air is filled with the vibrancy of spring. The city is buzzing with a fervent atmosphere of Sino-North Korean friendship in anticipation of his arrival.

Pyongyang has been beautifully decorated, and in the city center's Kim Il-sung Square, over 20,000 young people, dressed in traditional attire from both China and North Korea, are dancing joyfully to lively music as they rehearse a grand dance performance. Thousands of students at the Kumsusan Square and various school playgrounds are practicing welcome dances, holding bouquets and flower baskets. Sculptors from the Mansudae Art Studio are creating a "Sino-North Korean Friendship Statue" to present to General Secretary Zhao Ziyang. Musicians from various factories are rehearsing Chinese songs. The 500,000 people of Pyongyang from all walks of life are preparing to give a warm welcome to Zhao Ziyang, and the preparations are nearly complete.

According to Li Jaedeok, Deputy Director of the Pyongyang City Cultural Bureau, who is in charge of the preparations, Comrades Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il have repeatedly instructed that Zhao Ziyang must be welcomed with the most solemn ceremony. Various levels of the Party, social organizations, and mass organizations in Pyongyang, following the instructions of Secretary Kim Jong-il, have held lectures and reports in various forms to praise Sino-North Korean friendship.

Farmers at the Chosun-Chung Friendship Cooperative Farm in the suburbs of Pyongyang are busy with spring plowing preparations while also preparing to welcome Zhao Ziyang. Manager Cha Duhe excitedly said, "For 31 years, we have developed a deep friendship with the Beijing Red Star Sino-North Korean Friendship Commune and achieved fruitful results. When General Secretary Zhao visits, we will definitely introduce this to him."

A comrade from the International Department of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea told the reporter that the Workers' Party of Korea attaches great importance to the visit of General Secretary Zhao Ziyang. They will do their best to ensure a warm reception. Wherever General Secretary Zhao goes, he will receive a warm welcome from the Korean people.
