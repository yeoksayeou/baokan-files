Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 30th.

President Bush recently wrote a letter to Soviet leader Gorbachev regarding Central American issues, hoping that the Soviet Union would reduce its aid to Nicaragua to facilitate a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Nicaragua.

It is reported that Bush's letter was sent from Washington on the 29th, just before Gorbachev's visit to Cuba, and was handed over to the Soviet Foreign Minister today by the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union.

Meanwhile, Secretary of State Baker, speaking at a Latin American expert conference in Atlanta, said that on the issue of Central America, the United States expects the Soviet Union to show a "new way of thinking," and now, the Soviet Union has the opportunity to demonstrate this.
