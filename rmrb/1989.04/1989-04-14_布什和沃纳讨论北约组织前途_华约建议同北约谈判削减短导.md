Xinhua News Agency, Washington, April 12th.

President Bush and NATO Secretary-General Warner discussed the future of NATO today, and both agreed that NATO's role will remain as important as ever in the future.

Warner told reporters after the meeting that NATO is a stabilizing and security-enhancing factor. It not only helps to solidify political changes based on stability but also further improves East-West relations, bringing peace, order, and security to Europe.

He said that President Bush reaffirmed the United States' commitment to its obligations within NATO.

The modernization of NATO's short-range tactical nuclear weapons was also a key topic in Warner's discussion with Bush. Recently, NATO member countries have engaged in heated debates on this issue in the face of frequent peace initiatives by Soviet leader Gorbachev.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 13th.

Reporter Xu Hongzhi reports: The Warsaw Pact countries have formally proposed to NATO countries to hold negotiations on the issue of European short-range nuclear weapons as soon as possible.

This was proposed in a statement issued at the conclusion of the Warsaw Pact foreign ministers' meeting yesterday.

The statement said that as long as short-range nuclear weapons with enormous destructive capabilities exist in Europe, it is impossible to guarantee the security and stability of Europe and to completely eliminate the danger of a surprise attack. Maintaining, updating, and especially continuing to develop short-range nuclear weapons will have an increasingly destabilizing effect on the European military strategic situation. Therefore, the Warsaw Pact countries propose to hold negotiations in the near future on European short-range nuclear weapons, including the nuclear components of dual-capability weapons. The Warsaw Pact countries believe that gradually reducing and then eliminating European short-range nuclear weapons will help reduce the risk of war in Europe, strengthen trust, and create a more stable situation.

East German leader Honecker, who met with the foreign ministers of the Warsaw Pact countries yesterday, believed that the statement adopted by the foreign ministers' meeting was "very important."

　　布什和沃纳讨论北约组织前途
　　华约建议同北约谈判削减短导
    据新华社华盛顿４月１２日电　美国总统布什和北约秘书长沃纳今天就北约组织的前途问题进行了讨论，双方一致同意今后北约的作用仍像过去一样重要。
    沃纳在会谈后对记者说，北约组织是稳定和安全的因素，它不仅能使在稳定基础上发生的政治变化固定下来，还能进一步改善东西方关系，为欧洲带来和平、秩序和安全。
    他说，布什总统再次确认美国对北约组织所承担的义务。
    北约短程战术核武器的现代化问题也是沃纳同布什会谈的一个重要议题。面对苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫频频发动的和平攻势，北约成员国之间最近就这一问题展开了激烈的辩论。
    本报柏林４月１３日电　记者许宏治报道：华约国家正式向北约国家提出建议，尽快就欧洲短程核武器问题举行谈判。
    这是在昨天闭幕的华约国家外长会议发表的声明中提出的。
    声明说，在欧洲存在拥有巨大摧毁能力的短程核武器的情况下，保证欧洲的安全和稳定、彻底消除突然袭击的危险是不可能的。保持、更新特别是继续发展短程核武器，将会对欧洲军事战略态势产生越来越大的破坏稳定的作用。因此，华约国家建议在近期就欧洲短程核武器，包括双重性能武器的核武器部分，单独举行谈判。华约国相信，分阶段地削减然后消除欧洲的短程核武器，将有助于在欧洲减少战争危险，加强信任并创造更加稳定的形势。
    民主德国领导人昂纳克昨天在会见华约国外长时认为，外长会议通过的声明“非常重要”。
