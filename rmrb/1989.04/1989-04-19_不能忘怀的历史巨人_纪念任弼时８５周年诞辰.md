	An Unforgettable Historical Giant
	Commemorating the 85th Anniversary of Ren Bishi's Birth
	Liaokailong

	This year, April 30th, marks the 85th anniversary of the birth of the great Marxist and proletarian revolutionary Ren Bishi. At the age of 16 in 1920, he joined the Chinese Socialist Youth League, and soon became a member of the Chinese Communist Party. From 1920 until his untimely death in October 1950 at the age of 46, he dedicated himself for 30 years to the cause of the Chinese revolution, to the formation and development of Mao Zedong Thought, and to the victory of Marxism in China. Especially from 1940 until his death, during the 11 years when the Chinese revolution was thriving and achieving nationwide victory, he was consistently a member of the highest leadership core of the Communist Party of China. He was one of the leaders of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, and one of the founding fathers of the People's Republic of China. Liu Shaoqi said: "Comrade Ren Bishi is a model revolutionary, a model Communist, and one of the best leaders of the Communist Party of China. The victory of the Chinese people's revolution, the establishment of the People's Republic of China, and the 30 years of hard work and leadership in revolutionary struggles by Comrade Ren Bishi are inseparable."

	In 1925, at the age of 21, Ren Bishi served as the acting and then the secretary-general of the Central Committee of the Socialist Youth League, making significant contributions to the victory of the First Great Revolution. In May 1927, during the Fifth Congress of the Communist Party of China, he was elected as a member of the Central Committee. In June of the same year, he submitted a "Political Opinion Book" to the Central Committee on behalf of the Youth League, clearly opposing the right-opportunist line represented by Chen Duxiu.

	After the failure of the Great Revolution in 1927, he participated in the August 7 Emergency Conference and was elected as a member of the Provisional Central Political Bureau, leading the struggle against the new warlord rule of the Kuomintang. In November of the same year, he presided over the enlarged meeting of the Youth League Central Committee, criticizing the two erroneous tendencies of abolitionism and vanguardism within the league. Ren Bishi was always strict with himself and had a strong spirit of self-criticism. He said that during the early and middle stages of the land revolution, he was an active executor of the three "left" lines. However, in reality, he had resisted the first and second "left" lines. In May 1933, after being appointed as the secretary of the Hunan-Jiangxi Provincial Committee, he made many corrections to the errors of the "left" line in the Hunan-Jiangxi base area, saving a large number of cadres such as Zhang Qilong and Wang Shoudao. This means that he had begun to correct the third "left" error in the areas he led. In July 1934, he was appointed as the representative of the Central Committee and the chairman of the Military and Political Committee of the Red Sixth Army. In August, to explore the strategic transfer route for the main force of the Red Army, he led the Red Sixth Army westward with Xiao Ke and Wang Zhen. In October, they joined forces with He Long's Red Third Army (soon restored to the Red Second Army) in Guizhou and also served as the political commissar of the Red Second Army, saving the Red Second Army from a precarious situation and expanding it from 4,000 to over 10,000 in a year. He Long said: "Due to the merger of the two armies, especially the arrival of Comrade Bishi, we were able to resolve many major policy issues, which allowed the construction of the Hunan-Hubei-Guizhou-Chongqing revolutionary base area and the development of the troops to proceed on a more solid path." Later, he and He Long led the Red Second and Sixth Armies to support the Long March of the main force of the Red Army, smashing the enemy's encirclement of the Hunan-Hubei-Guizhou-Chongqing base area, which was about 10 times stronger. In November 1935, he and He Long led the Red Second and Sixth Armies, numbering 17,000 (with 2,000 left in the base area, who later broke through and advanced west, preserving 600 in eastern Guizhou to join the main force), to break through and march westward again. They traveled through central and western Hunan, across Guizhou and Yunnan, crossed the Jinsha River into western Sichuan, and after 7 months and 10 days, covering over 10,000 li, they joined forces with the Red Fourth Army in Ganzi. At this time, the Red Second and Sixth Armies (soon merged into the Red Second Front Army) still had a strength of 14,000, with more guns than when they set out. It should be noted that these two westward marches and Long Marches led by Ren Bishi were very successful, with a high proportion of preserved forces, far exceeding the Red First and Fourth Armies. At that time, Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Peng Dehuai jointly sent a telegram to Ren Bishi and others, saying: "You still have great strength, and there is unlimited potential for future development, which is a cause for celebration for the Chinese revolution."

	Ren Bishi's report "Experience and Lessons from Breaking Through the Enemy's 'Encirclement'" in September 1935 and his article "The Long March of the Red Second and Sixth Armies from the Hunan-Hubei Border to North Kang" in November 1936 fully demonstrate that he had independently formed a set of correct strategies and tactics for people's war that were consistent with Mao Zedong's military thought. His brilliant achievements in political and military leadership from 1933 to 1936 also prove that he was not only a capable politician but also an outstanding strategist with a high level of Marxism.

	When the Red First and Fourth Armies met and then parted ways, and Zhang Guotao's splitist behavior was rampant, the Red Army faced the great danger of splitting, Ren Bishi, along with Zhu De, Liu Bocheng, He Long, and others, firmly supported the Party Central Committee and used correct methods of intra-party struggle to fight against Zhang Guotao's anti-party splitist behavior. Finally, in October 1936, the three main forces of the Red Army—the Red First, Second, and Fourth Armies—achieved a victorious meeting in southern Gansu. This achievement is inseparable from Ren Bishi's immortal contributions.

	After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he served as the director of the Political Department of the Eighth Route Army and, together with Zhu De and Peng Dehuai, led the army deep into the enemy's rear in North China, mobilized the masses extensively, carried out guerrilla warfare, and conducted mobile warfare under favorable conditions, establishing anti-Japanese democratic base areas and successfully opening up the battlefield in the enemy's rear.

	In March 1938, he was dispatched by the Party Central Committee to Moscow to serve as the head of the Chinese delegation to the Communist International. In April of the same year, he submitted a written report outline "The Situation of the Chinese War of Resistance and the Work and Tasks of the Communist Party of China" to the Communist International. In May, he also made oral explanations and supplements. He pointed out that the War of Resistance was a protracted war that would go through the process of the Japanese army's advance, stalemate, and then counterattack. This was consistent with Mao Zedong's views in his book "On Protracted War" written in May of the same year. His report and various aspects of his work helped the Communist International understand the situation in China and the correctness of the Communist Party of China's strategy of both uniting with and struggling against the Kuomintang. The Communist International thus changed its previous one-sided view and passed a resolution affirming that the political line of the Communist Party of China was correct and that the Communist Party of China had truly applied Marxism-Leninism under complex environments and difficult conditions. Dimitrov also told Ren Bishi and Wang Jiaxiang, who was about to return to China, that the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China should be unified with Mao Zedong at the helm. At that time, the Communist Party of China was still a branch of the Communist International, so this was related to the future of the Chinese revolution. In this regard, Ren Bishi made great contributions.

	In March 1940, Ren Bishi returned to Yan'an to participate in the work of the Central Secretariat. In September 1941, he served as the secretary-general of the Central Committee. In March 1943, he, along with Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi, served as a member of the Central Secretariat, responsible for handling the daily work of the Central Committee and participating in the leadership of the Rectification Movement and the Mass Production Movement. In May 1944, he participated in the Seventh Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee and, at the request of the plenary session, drafted the famous "Resolution on Several Historical Questions." Subsequently, he participated in the Seventh National Congress, serving as the secretary-general. At the congress, he was re-elected as a member of the Central Committee, and at the First Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee in June, he was re-elected as a member of the Political Bureau and continued to serve as a member of the Central Secretariat with Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, and Zhou Enlai.

	After participating in the work of the Central Secretariat in 1940, Ren Bishi was responsible for party affairs and the construction of the base areas. On the issue of base area construction, he deeply expounded the importance of fully developing party democracy and people's democracy, and clarified that democratic construction and economic construction should be closely linked. In his speech in February 1941, he said: "Democratic construction and economic construction are closely related; both are indispensable, and neglecting one aspect will not allow the other to develop well." In April 1944, he also pointed out: "Revolution is for construction, and the foundation of construction is the development of the economy.... If we communists only know how to use war and violence to overthrow the old system and rule, but are not good at building a new society of plenty and happiness, then we will not be victorious."

	In his draft report "On Strengthening Party Spirit" in 1941, he pointed out that the issue of party spirit is the issue of high proletarian consciousness and proletarian awareness. At the same time, he pointed out, "The great strength of our party lies in its close connection with the broad masses, and in its obtaining the support of the broad masses." In his long speech in January 1943, he was the first to expound on the leadership method of the party's mass line. When discussing how to oppose bureaucratism, warlordism, and corruption within the party, he said: "What method should we use to oppose and struggle? The only way is to mobilize all party members within the party and the broad laboring masses within the government system to carry out criticism and supervision together.... That is to say, we must expand party democracy, expand people's democracy, and use this spirit of equality and democracy to carry out the struggle against liberalism, bureaucratism, warlordism, and corruption with the weapons of criticism and self-criticism." These profound discussions not only have great practical guiding significance at that time but also in the long-term socialist modernization construction in the future.

	During the period of the War of Liberation, Ren Bishi participated in the formulation of all major policies and directives of the party and the command of the nationwide war, especially from March 1947 to March 1948 during the period when the Party Central Committee was transferring in Shaanxi. He made outstanding contributions. During this period, the leadership of the Party Central Committee was highly centralized, which was completely in line with the extremely tense revolutionary war situation at that time. Later, Zhou Enlai recalled: "When we led the revolutionary war, there were only three people in the country and in the Central Committee who decided on issues. At that time, the Central Secretariat had five people, scattered in two places: one place was Comrade Liu Shaoqi and Comrade Zhu De, who led the nationwide land reform and built the base areas; in the Central Committee, there were only three people, Chairman Mao, Comrade Zhou Enlai, and Comrade Ren Bishi. The so-called Central Committee was these three people!" In reversing the "left" tide that appeared one after another in various liberated areas, Ren Bishi played a key role. Ye Jianying not only participated in the December 1947 Central Committee meeting but also participated in the preparatory meeting led by Ren Bishi on the land issue. Later, Ye Jianying pointed out: "The great achievements of Comrade Bishi in this regard are known to very few people."

	Ren Bishi had always correctly grasped the land reform policy and other social policies in the Party Central Committee. After the outbreak of the full-scale civil war, according to the "May 4th Directive," the land reform movement was carried out vigorously in various liberated areas. However, from September 1947, when the National Land Conference formulated the "Outline of the Land Law of China" with the center of equal distribution of all land, to the period after, there was a "left" adventurist tendency in the land reform led by Kang Sheng in the Jin-Sui liberated area in Xiaxian, Hejiaping Village. The characteristic of this erroneous tendency was to infringe on the interests of the middle peasants, to mistakenly classify many well-off middle peasants as rich peasants, to arbitrarily beat, fight, and kill landlords and rich peasants, and to confiscate the industrial and commercial enterprises operated by landlords and rich peasants. This "left" adventurist error caused serious social unrest in various liberated areas within a few months. After serious investigation and research, Ren Bishi proposed at the December 1947 Central Committee meeting to immediately correct this dangerous "left" error, and Zhou Enlai also proposed the necessity of correcting the "left" error. This proposal was adopted by Mao Zedong.

	After the December meeting, the Central Committee drafted a decision to correct the "left" error in land reform in January 1948 and sent it to various places for comments. Before the draft of this decision was made, Ren Bishi made a long speech "Several Issues in Land Reform" at the enlarged meeting of the Northwest Field Army Front Committee. In this speech, he made a profound theoretical and practical exposition on six important issues: the standard for classifying rural classes, the need to firmly unite all middle peasants, the methods of struggle against landlords and rich peasants (pointing out that our policy towards landlords is to eliminate their exploitation system, not to eliminate landlords as individuals), the policy towards industry and commerce, the issue of intellectuals and enlightened gentry, and the issue of beating and killing people. He also severely criticized the "left" adventurist error. Mao Zedong thought that Ren Bishi's speech was good and could correct the "left" deviation in land reform. On March 17, 1948, he telegraphed Liu Shaoqi in Hebei Jiansheng (now Ping Mountain) Xibaipo Village, saying: "We have decided to publish Comrade Bishi's speech and not to publish the draft decision of January because Comrade Bishi's speech is much richer than the January decision." On April 25, Deng Xiaoping pointed out in his report to the commanders of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Field Army in Lu Mountain County, Henan: "What are policies and strategies? How should we do it to overcome the 'left' deviation? Study the two documents 'Key Points of Land Reform in Newly Liberated Areas' (drafted by Comrade Mao Zedong) and 'Several Issues in Land Reform' by Comrade Ren Bishi. Basically, the problem can be solved. Moreover, these two documents analyze very carefully and thoroughly, completely in line with the new areas." In short, it can be said without exaggeration that "Several Issues in Land Reform" is one of the most important documents in the history of the Communist Party of China on the issue of land reform.

	It should also be mentioned that as early as May 1946, in the document "Basic Policies for Economic Construction and Finance, Trade, and Currency in the Liberated Areas" drafted by the Party Central Committee, Ren Bishi foresaw: "Under the conditions conducive to the development and prosperity of the economy in the liberated areas, it is possible to allow foreign capitalists to invest in the liberated areas, but it must be on the condition of respecting Chinese sovereignty and law.... In order to develop the industry in the liberated areas and attract national capital and even foreign capital to prosper the economy in the liberated areas, we must prevent overly leftist labor policies." This shows that Ren Bishi had proposed the policy of opening up to the outside world very early.

	When the People's Liberation Army was entering the decisive stage of the war and the victory of the national revolution was imminent, Ren Bishi proposed at the September 1948 Central Political Bureau meeting the issue of strengthening party democracy and people's democracy under the conditions of peaceful construction and institutionalizing them. He said: "There must first be party democracy before people's democracy can truly be established."

	Ren Bishi was a great communist and a true communist. His lofty character and excellent style are forever worth learning from by all communists, young communists, cadres, and the masses.

	Shortly after Ren Bishi's death, Zhou Enlai called on everyone to: "Commemorate Comrade Ren Bishi, learn from his spirit of self-sacrifice for 30 years of struggle without rest, learn from his tenacious struggle against the enemy and his spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people, learn from his spirit of adhering to principles and serving the truth." Zhu De said: "Comrade Bishi has set an example for all communists and all patriotic people, an example of loyalty and dedication to the people's interests, an example of persevering in revolutionary principles and unyielding spirit, and an example of simplicity and closeness to the masses."

	First of all, we should learn from his spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people, striving hard, enduring hardships, and not hesitating to sacrifice his life for the cause of communism. Ye Jianying said: "Comrade Ren Bishi... is our party's camel, the Chinese people's camel, carrying heavy burdens and walking a long, arduous road without rest, without enjoyment, and without any personal considerations. He is an outstanding communist, the best party member of our party, and our model."

	We should also learn from his theoretical connection with practice, seeking truth from facts, and his excellent style of closely connecting with the masses and following the mass line. Seeking truth from facts and the mass line are closely related and complementary. He is a model in both aspects. The reason he could independently lead political and military work from 1933 to 1936, resist Zhang Guotao's "left" splitist line, and achieve great results, successfully open up the battlefield in the enemy's rear in North China with Zhu De and Peng Dehuai during the War of Resistance, gain the understanding and support of the Communist International, and timely discover and correct the dangerous "left" error in land reform during the War of Liberation, and propose a series of far-reaching theoretical thoughts such as making democratic construction and economic construction progress simultaneously, is all inseparable from his style of insisting on seeking truth from facts and following the mass line.

	We should also learn from his spirit of adhering to principles, serving the truth, and self-criticism to correct errors, and his spirit of strictly demanding cadres while patiently guiding them. Peng Zhen said: "In the complex political struggles within and outside the party, Comrade Bishi has repeatedly shown his strong principle and amazing persuasive power, which has become a characteristic of his work style." Comrade Hu Yaobang said in a speech on March 27, 1986: "Comrade Bishi adhered to principles, was patient and persuasive, and was fair and upright. In the 1930s and 1940s, he won the respect of many people in our party. After his death in the early 1950s, so many years later, many old comrades still miss him... It's not easy to do this for several decades. If you don't adhere to principles, can you do the work so well?"

	Ren Bishi organically integrated his great contributions to the revolution with his personal excellent qualities, cultivation, and style, setting an example for us. He is an unforgettable historical giant. His rich theoretical thoughts, noble character, and excellent style are precious spiritual wealth for all communists, young communists, and the masses. Studying Ren Bishi's theoretical thoughts, learning from Ren Bishi's noble character and excellent style, and making positive contributions to the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the best way to commemorate Ren Bishi.

　　不能忘怀的历史巨人
  　纪念任弼时８５周年诞辰
    廖盖隆
    今年４月３０日，是伟大的马克思主义者和无产阶级革命家任弼时诞辰８５周年。他１９２０年１６岁就参加了中国社会主义青年团，不久转为中国共产党党员，到１９５０年１０月他４６岁时过早地病逝为止，３０年如一日地为中国革命事业，为毛泽东思想的形成和发展，为马克思主义在中国的胜利，作出了多方面的巨大的贡献。特别是他从１９４０年起到逝世止，在中国革命蓬勃发展并取得全国胜利的１１年间，一直是中国共产党最高领导核心成员，他是中国共产党和中国人民的领袖之一，是中华人民共和国的开国元勋之一。刘少奇说：“任弼时同志是一个模范的职业革命家，模范的共产党员和中国共产党最好的领导者之一。中国人民革命的胜利，中华人民共和国的成立，与任弼时同志３０年努力工作和领导革命斗争的历史是分不开的。”
    任弼时１９２５年２１岁时就任社会主义青年团中央代理总书记、总书记，为第一次大革命的胜利作出了重大贡献。１９２７年５月中共五大时，他当选为中共中央委员；同年６月，他代表团中央向党中央提出《政治意见书》，旗帜鲜明地反对以陈独秀为代表的右倾机会主义路线。
    １９２７年大革命失败后他参加了“八七”紧急会议，当选为临时中央政治局委员，参与领导反抗国民党新军阀统治的土地革命战争。同年１１月，他主持团中央扩大会议，批判了团内的取消主义和先锋主义两种错误倾向。任弼时一贯严于律己，富有自我批评精神，他说，土地革命前期和中期的三次“左”倾路线，自己都是积极执行者。但是实际上，他对第一、第二次“左”倾路线都是作了抵制的。１９３３年５月，他被任命为湘赣省委书记以后，对湘赣根据地肃反扩大化的错误，作了不少纠正，救出了张启龙、王首道等一大批干部。这就是说，他在自己所领导的地区内已开始纠正第三次“左”倾错误。１９３４年７月，他被任命为中共中央代表兼红六军团军政委员会主席；８月，为了给中央主力红军探索战略转移路线，他与萧克、王震一起率红六军团西征，１０月在贵州与贺龙率领的红三军（不久恢复红二军团番号）会师，并兼任红二军团政委，把红二军团从濒于危局中拯救出来，并在一年中由４０００人逐步扩大到一万有奇。贺龙说：“由于两个军团的会合，特别是弼时同志的到来……，使我们对许多重大的政策问题获得了解决，从而使湘鄂川黔革命根据地的建设和部队建设在更加健全的道路上向前发展”。此后，他和贺龙一起领导红二、六军团，策应中央主力红军长征，粉碎了优于自己约１０倍的敌人对湘鄂川黔根据地的围攻。１９３５年１１月，他和贺龙率领红二、六军团１７０００余人（还有二千人留根据地，不久突围西进，保留６００人在黔东与主力会合）再次从桑植突围长征，行经湘中、湘西，横贯贵州、云南，强渡金沙江入西康，历时７个月零１０天，行程一万余里，在甘孜与红四方面军会师。这时，红二、六军团（不久合组为红二方面军）还有兵力１４０００人，枪支比出发前还多了。应该指出，这两次以任弼时为首的西征和长征，都是非常成功的，保存兵力的比例之高，远远超过红一、四方面军，当时，毛泽东、周恩来、彭德怀联名致电任弼时等，说：“你们尚保存伟大力量，将来发展无量，可为中国革命庆贺。”
    任弼时在１９３５年９月作的报告《冲破敌人“围剿”的经验与教训》和１９３６年１１月写的《红二、六军团从湘鄂边到康东北长征经过》，充分说明，他这时已经独立地形成了一整套和毛泽东军事思想相符合的人民战争的正确战略战术。他在１９３３年到１９３６年担任政治军事的全面领导工作的辉煌成就也同样证明，他不仅是能独当一面的政治家，而且是一位卓越的战略家，具有很高的马克思主义水平。
    在红一、四方面军会师又分手，张国焘的分裂行为极为猖狂，红军面临分裂的巨大危险这样情况下，红二、四方面军汇合了，任弼时又和朱德、刘伯承、贺龙等一起坚定地拥护党中央，采用正确的党内斗争方式同张国焘的反党分裂行为作斗争，终于在１９３６年１０月实现了红一、二、四方面军三大主力红军在甘肃南部的胜利会师。这之中凝聚着任弼时的不朽功勋。
    抗日战争爆发后，他担任八路军政治部主任，和朱德、彭德怀一起率领军队深入华北敌后，广泛地发动群众，开展游击战争，并在有利条件下进行运动战，创建了抗日民主根据地，胜利地开辟了敌后解放区战场。
    １９３８年３月，他受党中央委派赴莫斯科，任中共驻共产国际代表团负责人。同年４月，他向共产国际递交了书面报告大纲《中国抗日战争的形势与中国共产党的工作和任务》；５月又作了口头说明和补充。他指出，抗日战争是持久战，要经过日军的进攻，到相持，然后转入反攻的过程。这同当年５月毛泽东写的《论持久战》一书的观点是吻合的。他的报告和多方面工作使共产国际对中国情况和中国共产党对国民党又联合又斗争的策略的正确性有了理解，共产国际从而改变过去的片面看法并作出决议，肯定中共的政治路线是正确的，确认中共是在复杂的环境和困难的条件下真正运用了马克思列宁主义。季米特洛夫又对任弼时和即将回国的王稼祥说，中共中央领导机关中要以毛泽东为首来解决统一领导问题。当时中共还是共产国际的一个支部，因而这关系到中国革命的前途。在这方面，任弼时是有巨大功绩的。
    １９４０年３月任弼时回到延安参加中共中央书记处工作，１９４１年９月担任中央秘书长，１９４３年３月和毛泽东、刘少奇一起任中央书记处书记，负责处理中央的日常工作并参与领导整风和大生产运动。１９４４年５月他参加党的六届七中全会，受中央全会委托主持起草了著名的《关于若干历史问题的决议》。随后参加了七大，任秘书长。他在大会上继续当选为中央委员，在６月七届一中全会上当选为中央政治局委员，并和毛泽东、朱德、刘少奇、周恩来一起继续当选为中央书记处书记。
    任弼时在１９４０年参加中央书记处工作后，分工管理党务和根据地建设工作。在根据地建设问题上，他深刻地阐述了充分发扬党内民主和人民民主的重要性，阐明了民主建设和经济建设要密切联系起来。他在１９４１年２月的讲话中说：“民主建设与经济建设，是有相互密切关系的，两者缺一不可，忽视了一方面，另一方面就不会得到很好的发展。”他在１９４４年４月还指出：“革命是为着建设，而建设的根本就是发展经济。……我们共产党人如果只晓得用战争和暴力来推翻旧的制度和统治，而不善于建设新的丰衣足食的幸福快乐的社会，那我们也是不会胜利的”。
    他在１９４１年所写的《关于增强党性问题的报告大纲》中指出，党性的问题就是高度的无产阶级觉悟和无产阶级意识的问题。同时指出，“我们党的伟大力量就在于它与广大群众有密切的联系，就在于它得到广大群众的拥护”。他在１９４３年１月的长篇讲话中，率先阐述了党的群众路线的领导方法。在谈到反对党内的官僚主义、军阀主义倾向和贪污腐败现象时，他说：“用什么办法去反对，去进行斗争呢？唯一的办法，就是在党内发动所有的党员群众，在政府系统中发动广大的劳动群众，大家来进行批评和监督。……也就是说，要扩大党内的民主，要扩大人民的民主，并运用这种平等的民主精神，以批评和自我批评的武器，来进行反对自由主义、官僚主义、军阀主义倾向以及贪污腐化的斗争。”他的这些精湛的论述不仅在当时，而且在现在和今后长时期内的社会主义现代化建设中，都有重大的现实指导意义。
    在全国解放战争时期，任弼时参与党的一切重大方针政策的制定和对全国作战的指挥，特别是在１９４７年３月到１９４８年３月党中央转战陕北期间，他作出了杰出的贡献。这个时期党中央的领导是高度集中的。这完全适应当时异常紧张的革命战争形势。后来，周恩来回忆说：“我们领导革命战争时，在全国、在中央决定问题的只有三个人。当时中央书记处共有五个人，分散在两个地方：一个地方是刘少奇同志和朱德同志，他们领导全国土改，搞根据地；在中央只有三个人，毛主席、周恩来与任弼时同志。所谓中央，就是这三个人嘛！”在扭转各个解放区相继出现的“左”倾狂潮中，任弼时起了关键性作用。叶剑英不仅参加了１９４７年１２月中央会议，而且参加了预备会议中任弼时领导的土地小组，深知这方面的情况。后来，叶剑英曾经指出：“弼时同志的这一伟大的功绩知道的人是很少的。”
    任弼时在党中央一直正确地掌握着土地改革政策和其它社会政策。全面内战爆发后，按照《五四指示》，土地改革运动在各解放区轰轰烈烈展开。然而，在１９４７年９月全国土地会议制定以平分一切土地为中心的《中国土地法大纲》前后，发生了由康生在晋绥解放区临县郝家坡村带头发起的土地改革中的“左”倾冒险主义倾向。这个错误倾向的特点是，侵犯中农利益，把许多富裕中农错划为富农，对地主富农乱斗乱打乱杀，没收地主富农经营的工商业。这种“左”倾冒险主义错误，几个月内在全国各个解放区造成了社会的严重震荡不安。任弼时经过认真的调查研究之后，在１９４７年１２月中央会议上及时提出要立即纠正这个危险的“左”倾错误倾向，周恩来也提出了纠“左”的必要。这个建议得到了毛泽东的采纳。
    １２月会议后中央在１９４８年１月１８日拟定了一个纠正“左”倾错误的土地改革决定草案，发给各地征求意见。任弼时在这个决定草案拟定以前在西北野战军前委扩大会议上作了《土地改革中的几个问题》的长篇讲话。在这个讲话中，他对根据什么标准来划分农村阶级，应该坚固地团结全体中农，对地主富农的斗争方法（指出我们对地主的政策是消灭他们的剥削制度，不是消灭地主个人），对工商业的政策，知识分子和开明绅士问题，打人杀人问题等６个重要问题，作了理论结合实际的深刻阐述，并且严厉地批评了“左”倾冒险主义错误。毛泽东认为任弼时这个讲话很好，能纠正土改中“左”倾偏向的问题，他于１９４８年３月１７日致电在河北建屏（今平山）西柏坡村的刘少奇说：“我们决定发表弼时同志的一篇讲演，不发表一月决定草案，因为弼时同志的讲演比一月决定充实得多。”４月２５日，邓小平在河南鲁山县对晋冀鲁豫野战军指挥员所作的报告中指出：“政策和策略究竟是什么东西？要怎么样来做，才能克服左的偏向？用心来研究《新解放区土地改革要点》（毛泽东同志起草）和任弼时同志的《土地改革中的几个问题》这两个文件，基本上可以解决问题。而且这两个文件分析得很周到细致，完全符合于新区。”总之，可以毫不夸大地说，《土地改革中的几个问题》这篇著作，是中国共产党历史上论述土地改革问题的最重要的文献之一。
    还应该提到，任弼时早在１９４６年５月为党中央起草的《解放区经济建设和财政金融贸易的基本方针》这个文件中，就富有远见地提出：“在有利于发展和繁荣解放区经济的条件下，可以允许外国资本家到解放区投资，但必须以尊重中国主权与法律为条件。……为着发展解放区工业，吸引民族资本以至外国资本到解放区繁荣经济，我们必须防止过左的劳动政策。”这说明，任弼时很早就提出对外开放政策的。
    当人民解放军正在进入战略决战阶段、全国革命胜利日益迫近的时候，任弼时在１９４８年９月中央政治局会议上的发言中，及时提出了在和平建设的条件下，必须加强党内民主和人民民主，并且使之制度化的问题。他说：“必须先有党内民主，人民的民主才能真正建立起来。”
    任弼时是一个伟大的共产主义者，一个真正的共产党员。他的崇高品德和优良作风永远值得我们共产党员、共青团员、广大干部和群众学习。
    周恩来在任弼时刚辞世不久就号召：“纪念任弼时同志，学习他３０年奋斗不已，至死不息的自我牺牲精神，学习他顽强对敌，全心全意为人民服务的革命精神，学习他坚持原则，服从真理的布尔塞维克精神。”朱德说：“弼时同志给全体共产党员和全体爱国人民树立了一个忠心耿耿、为人民利益鞠躬尽瘁的榜样，树立了一个坚持革命原则、百折不挠的榜样，树立了一个朴素切实、密切联系群众的榜样。”
    我们首先要学习他全心全意为人民服务，艰苦奋斗，任劳任怨，不惜牺牲自己的生命以殉共产主义事业的革命精神。叶剑英说：“任弼时同志……是我们党的骆驼，中国人民的骆驼，担负着沉重的担子，走着漫长的艰苦的道路，没有休息，没有享受，没有个人的任何计较。他是杰出的共产主义者，是我们党最好的党员，是我们的模范。”
    我们还要学习他的理论联系实际、实事求是，和密切联系群众、走群众路线的优良作风。实事求是和群众路线两者是密切联系相辅相成的。他在这两方面都堪称典范。他在１９３３年到１９３６年所以能独当一面，正确实施政治军事领导，同张国焘的“左”倾分裂路线作斗争并取得很大成果。在抗日时期和朱德、彭德怀一起成功地开辟华北敌后解放区战场，出使共产国际取得共产国际对中国党的理解和支持，在解放战争时期所以能及时发现和纠正土地改革中危险的“左”倾错误，并且能提出使民主建设和经济建设同时并进等一系列意义深远的理论思想，都是同他坚持实事求是、坚持群众路线的作风分不开的。
    我们还要学习他坚持原则、服从真理、修正错误的自我批评的精神，学习他对干部既严格要求，又循循善诱的精神。彭真说：“在我们党内和党外复杂的政治斗争中，弼时同志多次地表现了他的坚强原则性和惊人说服力的统一，这成了他的工作作风的一个特点。”胡耀邦同志在１９８６年３月２７日的一次谈话中说：弼时同志既坚持原则，又循循善诱，又公道正派，他在３０、４０年代就赢得了我们党许多人的尊敬。他５０年代初去世后，这么多年，许多老同志还在怀念他……几十年不容易哟，如果不坚持原则，能把工作搞得这么好啊？
    任弼时把对革命的巨大贡献和个人的优良品德、修养、作风有机地溶为一体，为我们树立了榜样，他是我们不能忘怀的历史巨人，他留下的丰富理论思想、高尚的品德和优良的作风，是我们共产党员、共青团员和广大人民的宝贵精神财富。研究任弼时的理论思想，学习任弼时的高尚品德和优良作风，为建设具有中国特色的社会主义而作出积极贡献，就是我们对任弼时的最好纪念。
