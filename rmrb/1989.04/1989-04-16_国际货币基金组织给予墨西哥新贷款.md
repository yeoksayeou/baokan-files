The International Monetary Fund Grants Mexico a New Loan

    The People's Daily, Mexico City, April 12 – Reporter Guo Weicheng reports: The Mexican government announced on April 11 that it has reached an agreement with the International Monetary Fund: the Fund will provide Mexico with 2.7972 billion Special Drawing Rights, equivalent to $3.635 billion in loans over the next three years, primarily to reduce Mexico's debt. Additionally, the International Monetary Fund has agreed to provide Mexico with $500 million in compensatory loans within the year. The International Monetary Fund has abandoned its previous demand for Mexico to implement "recessionary adjustments," acknowledging Mexico's efforts in stabilizing the economy and conducting structural reforms. The agreement also stipulates that Mexico's capital outflow, which has been 6% of its GDP over the past six years, should be reduced to within 2%.

    Through this agreement, the International Monetary Fund has for the first time acknowledged that a debt-ridden country has the right to pursue an economic growth strategy. The announcement of the agreement has sparked significant reactions. Today, The New York Times commented, "Mexico may become the first beneficiary of the Brady Plan." However, Mexico's Deputy Finance Minister for debt negotiations, Guria, cautiously stated that this agreement only improves Mexico's position in next week's debt negotiations with international banks, and the debt issue has not yet been resolved.

    Mexico's agreement with the International Monetary Fund marks a step forward in addressing the debt issue. However, it is currently difficult to say whether Mexico can achieve its goal of reducing its debt by 50% through negotiations and achieving economic growth.

　　国际货币基金组织给予墨西哥新贷款
    本报墨西哥城４月１２日电　记者郭伟成报道：墨西哥政府４月１１日宣布与国际货币基金组织达成协议：该组织给予墨西哥２７．９７２亿特别提款权，相当于今后３年内给予墨西哥３６．３５亿美元贷款，主要用于缩减墨西哥的债务。同时，国际货币基金组织还答应在年内向墨西哥提供５亿美元的补偿性贷款。国际货币基金组织宣布放弃过去曾要求墨西哥实行的“衰退调整”，承认墨西哥在稳定经济、进行结构改革方面所作的努力。协议还规定，要把墨西哥外流资金从过去６年期间占国内生产总值的６％压缩到２％以内。
    通过这个协议，国际货币基金组织第一次承认了一个债务国有权实行经济增长的战略。协议公布后，引起了很大的反响。《纽约时报》今天评论说：“墨西哥有可能成为布雷迪计划的第一个受益者”。但是，墨西哥财政部负责债务谈判的副部长古利亚审慎地说，这个协议只是有利于墨西哥下周与国际银行谈判债务的地位，债务问题还没有得到解决。
    墨西哥与国际货币基金组织达成协议，是朝解决债务问题前进了一步。但是，目前很难断言墨西哥是否因此就能达到通过谈判缩减５０％债务的目标和实现经济增长。
