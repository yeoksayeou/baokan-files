Upon arriving in Anqing, one feels as if they are in the midst of a Huangmei Opera theater. Especially when young women speak, it sounds like Yan Fengying's dialogue, very pleasing to the ear. In this historic city, there is a unique school—the Anhui Huangmei Opera School.

In Hefei, I had heard that the Anhui Huangmei Opera Theater was facing economic difficulties and could barely pay its performers' salaries. Hearing this news, one cannot help but be concerned. Therefore, I immediately interviewed the school principal about the school's current situation, especially the conditions of students learning and teachers teaching. Pan Zhongren, who started learning opera at the age of 9 and is now 51, said: It's strange, our school's economic situation is not very good, but the number of applicants is very high. This year, there are over 220 students, the most in the school's 32-year history. Some students do not want to leave during the winter break, and some return to school as early as the second day of the Lunar New Year to perform in the countryside with their teachers. The 76 teachers, none of whom are named "Hu," are particularly dedicated, especially the class teachers, who treat the students like their own children, with both strictness and affection...

We visited the classrooms. Some classrooms are large, with dozens of teenagers crowded together, listening to the teacher teach the role of a young male actor; a few young girls are dancing gracefully under the teacher's guidance. A young woman from Huangmei County, Hubei, is receiving one-on-one training from a famous female teacher. In the vocal music class, Wang Wenji, the main composer of "The Heavenly Match," is teaching. People only know that "The Heavenly Match" has a beautiful melody, but few know that the score is mainly his work. He is nearly 70 years old, but for the prosperity of Huangmei Opera, he is still silently contributing his remaining energy.

Principal Pan said that in the past 10 years, over a thousand students have been enrolled, and 800 have graduated. After practical stage experience, more than 10 have been praised as national Huangmei Opera stars, and more than 20 have served as directors or deputy directors of Huangmei Opera troupes in provinces and counties such as Anhui, Hubei, Shanxi, and Liaoning. More than half of the teachers at this school are graduates of the school itself. These locally grown teachers have mostly been sent by the school to Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, and other drama schools for training. Therefore, the teachers' qualifications and teaching quality are relatively high. They have accumulated and created more than 100 teaching plays, 200 scores, and compiled 80 professional and unit teaching materials. Ten of their major and minor plays have been made into movies and TV shows.

Last spring, Professor Brandel from the University of Göttingen in the Federal Republic of Germany visited and inspected the school twice. In November of last year, the school sent more than 20 students with the Anqing City Friendship Art Troupe to visit Japan. They performed five shows, all of which were sold out, and received enthusiastic praise from Japanese audiences, who also requested that they send people to Japan to teach Huangmei Opera skills. Visiting the Anqing Huangmei Opera School gives one a sense of confidence and hope.

　　黄梅戏的希望   
    ——访安徽黄梅戏学校
    本报记者  张振国
    一到安庆，就像置身于黄梅戏剧场的氛围之中。特别是女青年说话，就像严凤英在道白，非常悦耳动听。在这座历史古城里，有一所举国无双的学校——安徽黄梅戏学校。
    在合肥，曾听说安徽黄梅戏剧院因经济困难演职人员工资都难以发出，听到这个消息，不能不使人悬心。于是，我即向校长就学校现状，特别是学生学、先生教的状况进行调查。９岁学戏，现年５１岁的校长潘忠仁说：怪得很，本校经济状况并不大好，但报考的人特多。今年在校生２２０多名，是建校３２年来最多的一年。有的放寒假也不愿离校，有的正月初二就赶到学校，随老师下乡演出。７６位老师，没有一个姓“糊”的，特别是班主任，像父母对待子女那样既严又亲……
    我们来到教学现场。课堂有大有小。几十个青少年挤在一起，听老师教唱小生戏；七、八个小姑娘随着老师的手势翩翩起舞。一个来自湖北黄梅县的女青年，正由一位著名女教师进行单兵教练。在戏音课堂，《天仙配》主要作曲人王文治老师正在教学。人们只知道《天仙配》曲调好听，很少有人知道乐谱主要出自他手。他年近古稀，为了黄梅戏的繁荣，还在默默地发放余热。
    潘校长说，近１０年来招收学员上千人，学成８００人。经过舞台实践，被誉为全国黄梅戏名演员的已有１０多人，在安徽、湖北、山西、辽宁等省县以上黄梅戏剧团担任正副团长的已有２０多人。在该校执教的老师，一大半是本校的毕业生。这些土生土长的教师，多数已由校方挤出钱来送往北京、上海、南京等地戏剧学校培训。所以教师素质和教学质量都比较好。他们积累和创编了１００多出教学剧目，２００多部曲谱，编写专业教材和单元教材８０多种，被拍成电影、电视的大戏和小戏有１０部。
    去年春天，联邦德国格丁根大学勃兰德尔教授两次到该校参观、考察。去年１１月，该校曾选派２０多名学生，随安庆市友好艺术团出访日本。先后演出５场，场场客满，受到日本观众的热烈赞扬，并恳请他们能派人去日本传授黄梅戏技艺。参观安庆黄梅戏学校，使人产生了信心和希望。
