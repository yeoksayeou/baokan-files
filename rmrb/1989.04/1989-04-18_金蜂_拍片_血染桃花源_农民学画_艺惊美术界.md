On the morning of March 13, the Bee Film and Sound Publishing House was filming the final scene of the television action movie "Blood Stained Peach Blossom Hermitage" in Hunan's Peach Blossom Spring. The director and the production manager, in order to save time, ordered the 25-year-old male actor Xiàng Guāngfú to jump from a drum frame that was over 3 meters high. Due to the film crew's neglect of safety measures, the protective circle inside lacked sufficient padding, and Xiàng Guāngfú somersaulted out of the circle, resulting in severe head injuries and his subsequent death.

In the Fushan District of Yantai, Shandong, young farmer Zhào Wénzhú is passionately pursuing the art of painting. He has pioneered a unique style of glass painting. After these paintings were exhibited in Shandong and Beijing, some art circles were amazed by his work.

　　“金蜂”拍片　血染桃花源
　　　农民学画　艺惊美术界
    ●３月１３日凌晨，金蜂音像出版社在湖南桃花源拍电视打斗片《血染桃花庵》最后一个镜头时，导演和制片主任为了抢时间，要求２５岁的男演员向光福从３米多高的鼓架子上往下跳。由于摄制组忽视安全，保护圈内海绵垫子长度不够，向光福一个筋斗翻到圈外，因脑部受重伤而死亡。　　　　　　（徐叔华）
    ●山东烟台市福山区青年农民赵文竹，锐意探求绘画艺术，新辟出别具一格的玻璃画。这些画在山东、北京巡回展出后，美术界一些人士惊叹不已。
