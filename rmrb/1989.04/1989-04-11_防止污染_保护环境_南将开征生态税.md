	Preventing Pollution, Protecting the Environment
	Yugoslavia to Implement Ecological Tax

	BELGRADE, April 10 (Xinhua) — The People's Daily reports from Belgrade that the Yugoslavian Parliament's Committee for the Protection and Improvement of the Human Environment recently adopted a proposal from the South Slav Youth League. The proposal states that for any product whose manufacturing process pollutes the ecological environment, an ecological (protection) tax equivalent to 5% of the factory price should be levied. If the technology used to produce the product is more than ten years behind that of the European Community countries, an additional 1% tax should be levied annually. The collected tax revenue will be used as a special fund for improving the ecological environment in the relevant republics and autonomous provinces, and will be allocated according to plans approved by the parliament for specific purposes.

	Additionally, a supervisory body for ecological environment protection should be established. This body will oversee the current technologies used in Yugoslavia and their impact on the ecological environment, conducting social supervision and evaluation.
