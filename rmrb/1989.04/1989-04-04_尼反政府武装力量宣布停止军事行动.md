Nicaraguan anti-government forces announce cessation of military operations

	People's Daily, Caracas, April 3 (Reporter Zhu Manting): The top military leader of the Nicaraguan anti-government forces, Enrique Bermúdez, announced yesterday that they will not take any military actions before February 1990.

	Currently, there are 13,000 anti-government fighters along the Nicaragua-Honduras border. Bermúdez visited various military camps yesterday and reported to the troops about the $45 million in humanitarian aid provided by the United States. He said that the Nicaraguan resistance movement agrees to play a guarantor role in the process of democratization in Nicaragua. The U.S. Congress acknowledged this democratization process when it approved the provision of humanitarian aid.

	The Nicaraguan government, in accordance with the peace agreement reached by the heads of state of the five Central American countries in El Salvador, has decided to hold general elections on February 25 next year.

　　尼反政府武装力量宣布停止军事行动
    本报加拉加斯４月３日电  记者朱满庭报道：尼加拉瓜反政府武装最高军事领导人恩里克·贝穆德斯昨天宣布，在１９９０年２月前不再采取军事行动。
    尼洪边界地区目前有１．３万名反政府武装分子。贝穆德斯昨天巡视了各军事营地，向部队报告了美国提供４５００万美元人道主义援助的情况。他说，尼加拉瓜抵抗运动同意在尼加拉瓜民主化的进程中发挥担保人的作用。美国国会在批准提供人道主义援助时承认了这一民主化进程。
    尼加拉瓜政府根据中美洲５国首脑在萨尔瓦多达成的和平协议，已决定在明年２月２５日举行大选。
