Gansu Province has recently made arrangements to concentrate financial resources to build three major "granaries" in Hexi, Longdong, and Longzhong. The goal is to achieve basic self-sufficiency in grain within five years. The near-term planning targets for building these three granaries are as follows:

	— Expand the Hexi "Granary." Hexi Corridor, one of the 12 major commercial grain bases in the country, has over 8 million mu of grain fields. In the next few years, the grain field area will be further expanded, and scientific and technological investments will be strengthened. By 1993, the total grain production in this grain production area will increase by 4 billion kilograms compared to 1988, and commercial grain will increase from 7 billion kilograms to over 9 billion kilograms.

	— Rebuild the Longdong "Granary." Historically, Longdong has been the main grain-producing area in Gansu, but currently, it needs to import over 80 million kilograms of grain annually from other regions. In the future, efforts will be made to accelerate the construction of terraced fields and strip fields, and to improve low-yielding fields. By 1993, the total production will increase from 12 billion kilograms in 1988 to 16 billion kilograms, achieving a balance between production and sales within the region, and gradually contributing more in the following years.

	— Build the Longzhong "Granary." The middle reaches of the Yellow River, along with the Taohe, Weihe, and Dashan rivers, currently have over 3 million mu of irrigated land, with a significant portion being new irrigation areas developed in recent years. In the next five years, water conservancy projects and farming systems will be completed, increasing the yield per mu from the current 250 kilograms to 350 kilograms, thereby increasing total production by 3 billion kilograms and commercial grain by 2 billion kilograms.

	Thus, by 1993, Gansu Province's total grain production is expected to increase from 59 billion kilograms in 1988 to 75 billion kilograms, with an average of 325 kilograms of grain per person, achieving a rough balance between supply and demand within the province.

	To ensure the construction of the three major granaries, Gansu Province has decided to allocate the province's agricultural support funds and the 60 million yuan agricultural development fund established this year to this area. Additionally, through the "dual-track contract" system for administrative cadres and technical personnel, more than half of the grain fields will be able to promote comprehensive yield-increasing technical measures.

　　甘肃兴建三大“粮仓”    
    力争五年实现全省粮食基本自给
    据新华社兰州４月２３日电（记者冯诚）甘肃省最近做出部署：集中财力兴建河西、陇东、陇中三大“粮仓”，力争５年实现省内粮食基本自给。建设好３个“粮仓”的近期规划目标是：
    ——扩建河西“粮仓”。全国１２片商品粮基地之一的河西走廊，有８００多万亩粮田，今后几年要进一步扩大粮田面积，加强科技投入，使这一粮食生产区１９９３年总产比１９８８年增加４亿公斤，商品粮由７亿公斤增加到９亿公斤以上。
    　——重建陇东“粮仓”。陇东历史上是甘肃的主要产粮区，但目前却每年要从外埠调入８０００多万公斤粮食。今后要加快兴修梯田、条田，改造中低产田，提高粮食单产，１９９３年总产从１９８８年的１２亿公斤提高到１６亿公斤，实现区内产销平衡，以后逐年有所贡献。
    ——新建陇中粮仓。中部黄河沿岸以及洮河、渭河、大夏河流域现有水浇地３００多万亩，相当一部分是这几年搞的新灌区，今后５年实现水利工程配套和耕作制度改革，使单产从现在的２５０公斤提高到３５０公斤，总产增加３亿公斤，商品粮增加２亿公斤。
    这样，到１９９３年甘肃省粮食总产量预计从１９８８年的５９亿公斤提高到７５亿公斤，人均占有粮食３２５公斤，实现省内供需大致平衡。
    为了保证３大“粮仓”建设，甘肃省决定将全省财政支农资金和今年新建立的６０００万元农业发展基金重点向这方面倾斜；并通过行政干部和技术人员“双轨承包”办法，使一半以上粮田得以推广综合增产技术措施。
