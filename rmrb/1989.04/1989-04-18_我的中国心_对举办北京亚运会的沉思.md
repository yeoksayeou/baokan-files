1988 was a tumultuous year for China's sports community. The Chinese Olympic team was defeated in Seoul, and the domestic economic situation, marked by inflation, was also far from optimistic. This cast a shadow over the preparations for the 11th Asian Games, scheduled to be held in Beijing two years later.

In many intersections in Beijing and at the construction sites for the Asian Games, tall countdown billboards have been erected, reminding people daily that the Games are approaching. Currently, all preparatory work is at a critical stage, with no time to waste.

During my sporadic, year-long coverage of the Asian Games preparations, the most frequently mentioned word was "money." The state allocated 7 billion yuan, and an additional 2.8 billion yuan was borrowed, totaling 9.8 billion yuan. However, this amount falls short of the actual need of 21.85 billion yuan (our 21.85 billion yuan is still a small sum compared to the over 20 billion US dollars spent by South Korea for the Asian Games). Last year, a certain construction company faced a crisis when workers did not receive their wages due to lack of funds. At a meeting held before the Spring Festival, a deputy secretary-general of the organizing committee solemnly told the attendees that an average of 10 million yuan must be raised daily to fill the gap. 10 million yuan—how easy is that to achieve! The troubling issue of funding for the Asian Games construction has left everyone, from top to bottom, unable to eat or sleep in peace. This situation, coupled with the government's tightening of credit, has led to a series of reactions following the cooling down of the sports fever in the early 1980s. Thus, some people have raised objections: "Why did we decide to host it in the first place? If we can't afford it, we shouldn't host it. We should call it off early!"

What was our original intention in hosting the Asian Games? Was it to fulfill the "dream of a strong nation"?

Premier Li Peng candidly pointed out at the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress that the Asian Games are "a rather challenging issue." However, he also said, "We have no other choice but to overcome difficulties and do a good job in preparing for the Asian Games." "No matter how great the difficulties China faces, we must fulfill our promises."

Looking back at the records of the first 10 Asian Games, we see the names of the host countries: India, the Philippines, Indonesia, Iran, Thailand, Japan, and South Korea. Among them, Japan and South Korea have stronger economies than ours, while the others are roughly at the same level as China.

Under the strong request of friends from various countries and regions in Asia, on August 24, 1983, the president of the Chinese Olympic Committee, Zhong Shitong, sent a telegram to the president of the Asian Olympic Council, Fahad, formally applying to host the 11th Asian Games in Beijing in 1990. Less than a month later, the president of the International Olympic Committee, Samaranch, sent a telegram expressing hope that China's application would be successful. A year later, at the Asian Olympic Council meeting held in Seoul, Beijing easily defeated the other competitor, Hiroshima in Japan, through voting, securing the right to host the Asian Games. The facts are clear: hosting the Asian Games was not just our unilateral wish but also the expectation of many friends in Asia, as China is after all the leading sports power in Asia. Faced with such sincere sentiments, how should we respond to this expectation and trust?

For a century, China has suffered humiliation at the hands of foreign powers, which has instilled in our nation a strong desire for revival. However, this urgent sentiment often clashes with our backward economic reality, and the Asian Games project has been caught in this conflict amid China's economic difficulties.

However, this is only one aspect. Today, more than ever, China needs to open its doors wider, not just for economics and culture, but also for sports. If we lack the capability and confidence to host even an Asian Games, how will the world view us, and how will we view ourselves?

South Koreans see hosting the Asian Games and the Olympics as an opportunity to boost national confidence and enhance international status. American entrepreneur Peter Ueberroth added an economic factor, earning 250 million US dollars through the Los Angeles Olympics. Clever Chinese people should draw some inspiration and learn from this.

War and disasters often serve as intermediaries that enhance a nation's cohesion. Sports also have this function. Theoretically, sports should transcend politics, beliefs, and nations, becoming a common wealth of all humanity. However, I dare say that competitive sports, at least in the near future, cannot transcend national sentiments. Europeans and Americans also shed tears of joy and cheer loudly when their athletes stand on the podium.

For similar reasons, Taiwanese newspapers revealed during the Olympics that relevant parties in Taiwan are planning to propose hosting the 12th Asian Games.

On this elliptical track of the Earth, the scene of humans chasing and competing with each other is no less intense than the struggles on the sports field. It is our duty to shoulder the responsibility of the Asian Games. This can be said to be a sacred mission bestowed upon the People's Republic of China by history, and many descendants of the Yellow Emperor are aware of this...

For our country and nation, what do we need most today? Through many ordinary people, I have come to understand that what we need most is to "build our new Great Wall with our flesh and blood."

Beijing Decorative Fabrics Factory is a collective enterprise with only 345 employees. Last year, due to the construction of the South Second Ring Road flyover, the factory was relocated to Fengtai District. To build the new factory and save production, one-quarter of the workers were laid off and received only 70% of their wages. At this time, they saw in the newspapers that the Asian Games were short of funds. Thus, the factory director took the lead, and all the employees donated 1,065 yuan. When the factory sent someone to deliver this money to the Asian Games organizing committee, the staff of the fundraising department, holding this small package, had tears in their eyes.

On March 7, the same day that splitists caused unrest in Lhasa, students from the senior high school class of Shigatse No. 1 Middle School in Tibet sent a letter along with 200 yuan to Beijing. They wrote in the letter: "Hosting the Asian Games well is a heavy responsibility entrusted to our country by the people of various countries and regions in Asia. Currently, our country's financial resources are still very limited. We organized a small fundraising drive in our school to contribute a token of the Tibetan people's love for our motherland."

A young man, Wang XX, who is serving a sentence in Liyang, Jiangsu, sent 50 yuan to the Asian Games along with a long letter. In the letter, he deeply regretted his past actions. He will be released in 1991. Although he cannot attend the Asian Games next year, he sincerely hopes that our motherland can successfully host the Games.

Zong Jingren, who enlisted in 1948 and was a deputy chief of staff of a certain air force division in Beijing before retirement, not only contributed 1,000 yuan from his savings to the Asian Games but also, with his luggage, moved to the Asian Games construction site to start 100 days of voluntary labor for the greening of the Asian Games project.

Hosting large-scale international sports events requires not only government funding but also significant support and donations from various sectors of society. This has become an international norm. Our country is not yet wealthy, so we need even more support from society and all the people, pooling resources to form a vast sea.

When Mr. Ho Ying-tung donated 1 billion Hong Kong dollars to the Asian Games, he said: "Every Chinese person, every descendant of the Yellow Emperor, hopes that the Beijing Asian Games will be successful and even better." His words represent the wishes of hundreds of millions of descendants of the Yellow Emperor at home and abroad.

In Beijing, operating an individual taxi business, Liang Yiquan suddenly donated 10 million yuan to the Asian Games. He said: "I often drive my taxi past the Asian Games construction site. I heard that funds are insufficient, and sometimes work is suspended. Who among the Chinese people is not anxious? Such a large international sports event, China is hosting for the first time, we can only do it well, we cannot fail. The ancients also said that the fate of the country concerns every individual! I want to set an example and hope that the 20 million individual business owners across the country can all contribute to the Asian Games."

Master of arts Hou Baolin, after many years of retirement from the stage, returned to perform and donated the 100,000 yuan earned from the performance to the Asian Games. Hong Kong singer Zhang Mingmin, whose song "My Chinese Heart" has been popular throughout the country, has been performing for the Asian Games in more than a dozen provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country for over a year.

Many calligraphers and painters have also donated their artistic works, and many domestic enterprises have generously contributed. Donations from the United States, Japan, Hong Kong... all flew to the 11th Asian Games Fund with hearts burning with patriotism.

Faced with these burning hearts of China, I am reflecting...

Life is not perfect, let alone a large-scale project like the Asian Games. Recently, the newspapers exposed incidents of materials being stolen from the Asian Games construction sites and some places spending money recklessly. It is understood that these situations have been noticed by the relevant departments of the Asian Games and measures have been strengthened. The Asian Games carry the deep feelings and wishes of hundreds of millions of descendants of the Yellow Emperor at home and abroad for the revival of China. Only by weighing its full significance can we tightly hold onto every penny.

On September 22, 1990, when we welcome the grand sports festival of the Asian people in the capital of the Republic of China, Beijing, and when we cheer for the athletes who win gold medals on the field, we should not forget them—the people who, with their ordinary bodies, support the magnificent edifice of sports.

　　“我的中国心”
　　——对举办北京亚运会的沉思
    本报记者　陈昭
　１９８８年，中国体育界的多事之秋。中国奥运军团受挫于汉城，
    　　国内通货膨胀的经济形势亦不容乐观，为两年后将在北京召开的第十一
    　　届亚运会投上一层阴影。
    在北京不少路口，在亚运会建筑工地上，竖起了高大的倒数计时广告牌，它每日都在提醒人们，亚运会一天天临近了，目前各项准备工作已到紧锣密鼓、刻不容缓的关口。
    在零零星星、长达一年多的采访亚运会筹备工作的日子里，听到最多的是一个“钱”字。国家所给的７亿元加上贷款的２．８亿元共９．８亿元，与实际需要的２１．８５亿元之间，差距太大了（我们的２１．８５亿元人民币与南朝鲜为亚运会所花费的２０多亿美元相比，仍是一个小数目）。去年就有某建筑公司因没有钱，发生了工人拿不到工资的事情。组委会一位副秘书长在春节前召开的一次会上，不无沉重感地对与会者说，平均每日需集资百万元，才能补足缺口。百万元，谈何容易！扰人的亚运工程建设资金，使上上下下都食不甘味，寝不安席。这种情况再加上国家紧缩银根，８０年代初掀起的体育热的降温发生了一连串连锁反应，于是一些人提出诘难：“当初为什么要办？办不起就别办，趁早收场！”
    我们办亚运会的初衷是什么呢？是为了圆“强国之梦”吗？
　李鹏总理在七届人大二次会议上回答记者提问时坦率地指出，亚运
    　　会是“一个不太轻松的问题”。但同时他说，“我们没有别的出路，只
    　　有克服困难，把亚运会的准备工作做好”。“中国有再大的困难，也要
    　　实现我们的诺言”。
    翻开前１０届亚运会的史册，我们可以看到，印度、菲律宾、印尼、伊朗、泰国、日本、南朝鲜这样一些举办者的名单。其中日本、南朝鲜经济实力强于我们，其余那些国家同中国大体处于相近的水平线上。
    在亚洲各国和地区朋友们的强烈要求下，１９８３年８月２４日，中国奥委会主席钟师统致电亚奥理事会主席法赫德，正式提出１９９０年在北京举办第十一届亚运会的申请。未及一个月，国际奥委会主席萨马兰奇来电，希望中国的申请能获得成功。一年后，在汉城举行的亚奥理事会上，经过投票表决，北京毫不费力地战胜了另一个竞争对手日本广岛，取得了亚运会主办权。事实很清楚，举办亚运会这并非我们的一厢情愿，也是亚洲许多朋友们的期望，因为中国毕竟是亚洲头号体育大国。面对一片殷殷之情，我们该怎样回答这种期待和信任呢？
    百年来中国受辱于列强的历史，使我们民族产生了一种强烈振兴的愿望，但这种急切的心情又往往和我们落后的经济现状产生剧烈的冲突，亚运会这一巨大工程就是在中国经济遇到困难的大背景下，被卷入冲突的漩涡。
    然而，这只是一个方面。中国今天比任何时候都需要更大地敞开自己的国门，这不仅包括经济文化，同时也应包括体育。如果我们连举办一个亚运会的能力和自信都没有，世界将怎样看待我们，我们又将怎样看待自己呢？
    南朝鲜人把举办亚运会和奥运会当作是增强民族自信和提高国际地位的一个契机。美国的尤伯罗斯又把经济因素加了进去，通过洛杉矶奥运会赚了２．５亿美元。聪明的中国人，多少应该从中受到一点启发和学习到一些东西。
    战争、灾难常常成为使一个国家和民族产生凝聚力的中间媒介，体育也有着这种功能。从理论上讲，体育应超越政治、信仰、国家，成为全人类共有的财富。但是我敢断言，竞技体育起码在近几十年内无法超越民族感情。欧洲人、美洲人在看到他们的选手登上领奖台时，也是热泪盈眶、狂呼不已。
    大约出于同样的想法，台湾报纸在奥运会期间透露，台湾有关方面正拟提出举办第十二届亚运会。
    在地球这个椭圆形的大跑道上，人类你追我赶、激烈竞争的情景丝毫不亚于运动场上的拚搏。责无旁贷地挑起亚运会这副担子，这可以说，是历史赋予中华人民共和国的神圣使命，许许多多炎黄子孙都意识到了这一点……
　对我们国家和民族来说，今天最需要的是什么呢？通过许多普通百
    　　姓，我懂得了，最需要的是“用我们的血肉，筑成我们新的长城。”
    北京装饰布厂是一个只有３４５人的集体企业。去年由于修建南二环路立交桥，该厂被迁到丰台区。他们为建新厂和搞生产自救，全厂１／４工人在家待业、只发７０％工资。此时，他们从报刊上看到亚运会工程资金不足的消息。于是厂长带头，全厂职工捐献了１０６５元。当厂里派人把这笔钱送到亚运会组委会时，集资部的工作人员捧着这个小小的纸包，眼眶湿润了。
    就在分裂主义分子在拉萨制造骚乱的３月７日当天，西藏藏格一中高三文科班的同学们把一封信连同２００元钱寄往北京。他们在信中写道：“办好亚运会，是亚洲各国和地区的人民委托给我们国家的重担，目前国家财力还很薄弱，我们在学校里搞了一个小小的募捐，以献上藏族儿女对祖国的一份心意。”
    一个正在江苏溧阳服刑的青年王××，他在给亚运会寄来５０元钱的同时还写了一封长信。信中对自己的过去作了深深的忏悔。１９９１年他才能刑满释放。明年的亚运会他赶不上了，但他衷心地希望祖国能成功地办好亚运会。
    宗景仁，１９４８年入伍，离休前是北京空军某师的副参谋长。他不仅从自己的积蓄中拿出了１０００元钱交给亚运会，还带着行李住到亚运会工地，开始了为亚运会工程绿化植树１００天的义务劳动。
    举办大型国际运动会，除了政府拿一部分钱外，还有相当一部分经费需要靠社会各界的支持和资助。这已成为国际上的惯例。我们国家还不富裕，就更需要社会和全体人民的支持，集腋成裘，涓滴成海。
    霍英东先生在捐款１亿元港币给亚运会时说：“每一个中国人，每一个炎黄子孙，都期望北京亚运会办得成功，办得更好。”他的话，代表了海内外亿万炎黄子孙的心愿。
    在北京经营个体出租车业的梁亚权一下子拿出１０万元钱献给亚运会。他说：“我常开出租车路过亚运会工地，听说经费不足，有时还停工，中国人谁不着急？这么大的国际运动会，我们中国第一次办，只能办好，不能办砸了，这代表我们国家形象。古人还讲天下兴亡、匹夫有责呢！我想带个头，希望全国２０００万个体户都能为亚运会作点儿贡献。”
    艺术大师侯宝林在息影舞台多年之后再次出山，把义演所得的１万元捐献给了亚运会。以一曲“我的中国心”风靡大江南北的香港歌星张明敏，一年多来已在全国十几个省、市、自治区为亚运会作了义演。
    还有许多书法家、画家，奉献出了他们的艺术精品，国内许多企业也慷慨解囊。来自美国、日本、香港……带着一颗颗滚烫的赤子之心的捐款也都飞向第十一届亚运会基金会。
    面对一颗颗滚烫的中国心，我在思索……
    生活中并非一切都是白璧无瑕，更何况是亚运会这样一个规模浩大的工程。不久前，报上披露亚运会建筑工地材料被盗事件和有些地方花钱大手大脚。据了解，这些情况都引起了亚运会有关部门的重视并加强了措施。亚运会寄托着海内外亿万炎黄子孙希望中华振兴的深情和愿望，只有掂量出它的全部份量，才可能把每一分钱都紧紧地攒在手里。
    １９９０年９月２２日，当我们在共和国的首都北京，迎来亚洲人民盛大的体育节日的时候，当我们为在赛场上获得金牌的健儿们欢呼的时候，我们不要忘记他们——用自己普通的身躯支撑起壮丽的体育大厦的人们。
