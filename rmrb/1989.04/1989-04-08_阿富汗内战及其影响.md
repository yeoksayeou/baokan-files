The battle for Jalalabad has been ongoing for a month. The attacking Afghan Seven-Party Alliance guerrillas have not made significant breakthroughs; the defending Kabul government forces have also been unable to lift the siege. As we enter April, this city battle shows signs of escalation. The guerrillas have decided to dispatch an additional 20,000 troops, bringing the total besieging force to around 40,000. The Kabul side has also sent reinforcements by land and air, mostly consisting of "volunteer" forces made up of members of the People's Democratic Party. In terms of weapons used in the war, both sides are leaving no stone unturned. The Kabul government forces use MiG-27 fighter jets for low-altitude strafing and bombing, causing significant casualties among the guerrillas; the guerrillas retaliate with Stinger missiles. Over the past month, the number of casualties on both sides has exceeded 1,000, with countless injured.

The guerrillas have recently formulated a new battle plan. In addition to continuing to concentrate forces to attack Jalalabad, they have launched offensives against major cities such as Kabul, Kandahar, and Herat. They have also engaged in firefights with government forces on both sides of the Salang Highway and begun firing rockets into Kabul. The Kabul government has declared that the situation in Afghanistan has reached a "critical juncture," calling on the United Nations Secretary-General to pay attention to the developments. A civil war using advanced weapons from two superpowers to kill Afghans shows signs of becoming prolonged and widespread.

Although the conflict within Afghanistan is a civil war, its impact extends far beyond Afghanistan itself, casting a shadow over South Asia and the international community.

First, it has affected the improvement of Indo-Pakistani relations. At the end of last year, during the South Asian Regional Alliance summit in Islamabad, the prime ministers of India and Pakistan met, and both expressed a desire to improve relations, signing three agreements, including "not attacking each other's nuclear facilities." International opinion was pleased to see the two new-generation prime ministers working to change the confrontational situation between the two major powers in South Asia. However, since the outbreak of the Jalalabad battle, Indian newspapers have accused Pakistan of interfering in the Afghan civil war, while Pakistani newspapers have also occasionally cited information from the guerrilla side to criticize India. This atmosphere is not conducive to the trend of improving Indo-Pakistani relations.

Second, it has hindered Soviet-Pakistani reconciliation. Before and after the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister Vorontsov and Foreign Minister Shevardnadze visited Pakistan, promising multiple economic aid packages. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto also expressed a willingness to improve relations with the Soviet Union after the resolution of the Afghan issue. People had hoped for a "thaw" in Soviet-Pakistani relations. However, after the outbreak of the Afghan civil war, both sides have accused each other, causing relations to cool down. It seems that the Afghan issue remains a major obstacle to improving Soviet-Pakistani relations.

Third, the hardline stances of the United States and the Soviet Union on the Afghan issue have not changed. Both sides have expressed their intention to continue supplying weapons to their respective supported factions. In fact, the weapons used by both sides in the Afghan civil war come from these two superpowers. Without a source of weapons, the civil war could not be fought. From the current situation, it appears that Afghanistan will continue to be a hotspot and a bargaining chip in U.S.-Soviet relations.

　　阿富汗内战及其影响
    本报记者  任毓骏
    贾拉拉巴德战事已进行了一个月。进攻者阿富汗七党联盟游击队没有取得重大突破；据守者喀布尔政府军也未能解除游击队的包围。进入４月份，这场攻城战出现升级趋势。游击队决定增派部队约两万名，这样围城的兵力达到４万左右。喀布尔方面也从地面和空中运来了增援部队，多为由人民民主党党员组成的“志愿军”。在投入战争的武器方面双方也无所不用其极。喀布尔政府军用米格—２７战斗机低空扫射和轰炸，给游击队造成重大伤亡；游击队则用毒刺导弹予以回击。一个月来，攻守双方阵亡人数都已逾千，伤者不计其数。
    游击队最近制订了新的作战方针，除继续集中力量攻打贾拉拉巴德外，还发动了对喀布尔坎大哈和赫拉特等大城市的进攻，还在萨朗公路两侧和政府军交火并开始向喀布尔市发射火箭。喀布尔政府惊呼，阿富汗局势已到了“紧要关头”，要求联合国秘书长关注事态的发展。一场使用两个超级大国的先进武器杀伤阿富汗人的内战有持久化和全面化的趋势。
    阿富汗境内的冲突虽是一场内战，但其影响范围远不止阿富汗一国，它给南亚地区乃至国际社会都投下了阴影。
    第一，它影响了印巴关系的改善。去年年底在伊斯兰堡召开南亚区域联盟首脑会议时，印巴两国总理会晤，双方都表示了改善关系的愿望，并签署了“互不攻击对方核设施”等３项协定。国际舆论曾为两位新一代总理着手改变南亚地区两个大国的对峙局面感到高兴。但贾拉拉巴德之战爆发以来，印度报纸指责巴基斯坦插手阿富汗内战，巴基斯坦报纸也不时援引游击队方面的消息，对印度有所指责。这种气氛和改善印巴关系的趋势就不太协调。
    第二，它妨碍了苏巴和解。苏联从阿富汗全部撤军前后，苏联第一副外长沃龙佐夫和外长谢瓦尔德纳泽相继访问巴基斯坦，许诺向巴基斯坦提供多项经济援助，贝·布托总理也表示愿在阿富汗问题解决后和苏联改善关系。人们曾期待苏巴关系“由冷变暖”。但在阿富汗内战爆发后，双方也互相指责，使关系冷了下来。看来阿富汗问题仍是巴苏改善关系的重大障碍。
    第三，美苏两国在阿富汗问题上的强硬立场都没有改变，双方都表示要继续向各自支持的一方输送武器，事实上阿富汗内战双方使用的武器都来自美苏这两个超级大国，没有武器来源，内战是打不起来的。从现在的局势看，阿富汗这个热点还将继续成为美苏关系中一个讨价还价的筹码。
