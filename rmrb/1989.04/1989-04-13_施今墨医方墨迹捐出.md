    The donation ceremony for the calligraphy of prescriptions by Shi Jinmo was held recently at the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

    Shi Jinmo, who dedicated his life to medicine, had extensive experience and exceptional medical skills, and was one of the "Four Famous Doctors" in Beijing. To inherit and carry forward the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine, his daughter-in-law, Xiong Qi, donated the calligraphy of prescriptions that she had cherished for many years to the Library and Information Research Institute of the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine without any compensation.
