A special train adorned with vibrant patterns is traveling along the railways of Sweden. This train, consisting of five carriages, is an art exhibition on wheels, known as the "Museum on Wheels."

Upon entering the exhibition carriages, visitors can see various artworks borrowed from museums across Sweden, ranging from King Carl VII's sword to rare masterpieces and sculptures. The exhibits in this "museum" are regularly updated. Last winter, an art exhibition titled "What is True Beauty?" featured over 130 pieces. Recently, a "New Scenery" art exhibition was held, attracting over 70,000 visitors from 42 towns, receiving widespread acclaim.

In addition to the exhibitions, artists are invited to give lectures on the train. The carriages also include a small library, a reading room, and a shop selling posters, postcards, and small art pieces. This mobile exhibition train travels to various locations, specifically serving small towns and remote areas that lack museums. The train's exhibition services are supported by the government, with the carriages provided free of charge by the national railway bureau.

    在瑞典的铁路线上行驶着一列绘有鲜艳图案的特别列车。这是由５节车厢组成的艺术品巡回展览车，被称为“车轮上的博物馆”。
    人们走进展览车厢可以看到从瑞典各地博物馆借调来的各种艺术品，从瑞典国王卡尔七世的宝剑到稀世名画和雕塑。这个“博物馆”的展品还定期更换。去年冬天举办的艺术展览，名为“什么是真正的美？”展品共有１３０多件。不久前又举办了“风光新貌”画展，吸引了４２个城镇的７万多名观众，受到普遍的赞赏。
    除举办展览外，还邀请一些艺术家随车举办讲座。车厢里另设有小图书馆、阅览室以及出售张贴画、明信片或小艺术品商店。这列巡回展览车驰骋各地，专为那些没有博物馆的小城镇或边远地区的居民服务。展览车的巡回展览服务得到了政府的支持，车厢就是国家铁路局免费提供的。
