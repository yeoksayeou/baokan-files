	Li Peng, the Premier, said to the representatives of Chinese students in Japan tonight, "The motherland has great expectations for you. It is hoped that you will cherish the honor of the motherland, demonstrate the excellent qualities of the Chinese people—diligence, discipline, and high morality, achieve results in your studies, and not let down the trust placed in you by the people of the motherland."

	The students responded with a long, enthusiastic round of applause.

	Li Peng met with over 150 student representatives from the Tokyo area at the Chinese Embassy in Japan.

	Li Peng first expressed his concern for the students studying abroad. He said, "China is a populous developing country. We cannot simply copy the Soviet Union or the West. We must absorb the strengths of other countries and make them our own. Japan has many areas worth learning from in management, education, and scientific and technological development." He urged the students to learn everything beneficial to China and use it to serve the motherland.

	Li Peng told everyone that the policy of sending students abroad will continue and will be further relaxed. More suitable and convenient conditions will be provided for those who return after completing their studies, gradually creating an environment where learning can be put to use.

	Currently, there are approximately 7,000 Chinese students, trainees, and visiting scholars in Japan.

	Premier Li Peng tonight encouraged the overseas Chinese in Japan to make further efforts to contribute to the development of the everlasting friendly cooperation between the peoples of China and Japan and to the great cause of reform and opening up in the motherland.

	Li Peng made this appeal when he met with representatives of the overseas Chinese community at the Chinese Embassy in Japan.

	The meeting hall was filled with a warm and joyful atmosphere of family reunion. Li Peng happily shook hands with the overseas Chinese representatives standing in the front row.

	Amidst enthusiastic applause, Li Peng delivered an impromptu speech. He first, on behalf of the Chinese government, extended warm greetings to the overseas Chinese representatives and, through them, to all overseas Chinese in Japan. He said that the Chinese government and people highly value the friendship with the Japanese people. This friendship has been cultivated over a long period by the older generation of politicians and the general public in both countries. More than 40 years ago, there was a war between the two countries, and there was a period of unpleasant history. It is precisely against this background that the friendship and friendly relations between the two peoples today are so precious. We should cherish them. He hoped that the overseas Chinese would abide by the local laws and model the maintenance of Sino-Japanese friendship. He also emphasized that friendship has principles, which are to correctly handle historical issues and the Japan-Taiwan relationship. He said that Prime Minister Takeshita had responded to his words. During his meeting with Emperor Akihito, he had said, "Learn from the past to ensure the future." Reviewing history is to look forward to a better future.

	Li Peng also briefed the overseas Chinese representatives on the current situation of reform and opening up in the motherland. He said that the policy of reform and opening up has achieved great success in the past, and for the current difficulties, measures to control them should be taken. The purpose of control is to create better conditions and to seek further development. He asked the overseas Chinese to be at ease. When he talked about the current policy of reform and opening up, which will not change and should not change, the overseas Chinese representatives responded with enthusiastic applause.

	Li Peng concluded by quoting the phrase, "Business thrives across the four seas, wealth flows into the three rivers," wishing the overseas Chinese in Japan a prosperous family and thriving business. The hall erupted in another round of enthusiastic applause.

	Overseas Chinese leaders from Tokyo, Sapporo, Osaka, Kobe, Nagasaki, Fukuoka, and other parts of Japan, including those from Taiwan, and prominent figures from various sectors, totaling over 200 people, attended the meeting.

　　李鹏分别会见我留日学生和华侨代表
　　希望海外学子不辜负祖国的重托
　　勉励旅日华侨致力发展中日友好
    新华社东京４月１４日电　（记者李德安）李鹏总理今天晚上对中国在日本的留学生代表说：“祖国对你们寄予很大希望，殷切希望你们珍惜祖国的荣誉，表现出中国人民勤奋、守纪律、道德高尚的优良品质，学出成果，不辜负祖国人民的重托。”
    留学生代表们对他的讲话报以长时间的热烈掌声。
    李鹏在中国驻日本大使馆礼堂会见了１５０多名来自日本东京附近的留学生代表。
    李鹏首先对留学生在异国他乡刻苦攻读表示慰问。他说：“中国是个人口众多的发展中国家，既不能照搬苏联，也不能照搬西方。要吸收其他国家的一切长处为我所用。日本在经营管理、发展教育、振兴科技等领域就有许多地方值得学习。”他号召留学生把对中国有益的一切经验统统学过来，以便为祖国服务。
    李鹏告诉大家，今后继续对外选派留学生的政策决不会改变，还要放宽政策，为那些学成归来的人提供更合适、更方便的条件，逐步创造学有所用的环境。　
    目前，中国在日本约有７０００名留学生、进修生和访问学者。
    新华社东京４月１４日电　（记者李德安）国务院总理李鹏今晚勉励旅居日本的华侨要进一步作出努力，为发展中日两国人民世世代代的友好合作关系和祖国改革、开放的宏伟大业作出积极的贡献。
    李鹏是在中国驻日本大使馆会见华侨代表时提出这个希望的。
    会见厅里洋溢一派亲人团聚、喜气洋洋的欢乐气氛。李鹏高兴地同站在前排的华侨代表一一握手。
    在热烈的掌声中，李鹏发表了即席讲话。他首先代表中国政府向华侨代表并通过他们向全体旅日侨胞致以亲切的问候。他说，中国政府和人民非常重视同日本人民的友谊。因为这种友谊是中日两国老一代政治家和民间人士长期努力培植起来的。４０多年前，两国之间发生过战争，有过一段不愉快的历史。正是在这种背景下，今天两国人民的友谊和友好关系才是来之不易的，我们应该十分珍惜。他希望华侨要遵守当地的法律，模范地维护中日友好。他同时强调，友好是有原则的，那就是要正确对待历史，正确对待日台关系。他说，竹下首相对我的话作出了响应。在会见明仁天皇时我曾说，“前事不忘，后事之师”。回顾历史是为了展望更美好的未来。
    李鹏还向华侨代表介绍了祖国改革、开放的现状。他说，改革、开放政策过去取得很大成功，对于当前遇到的困难，要采取治理措施。治理的目的是为了创造更好的条件，是为了谋求进一步的发展。他请侨胞放心。当他谈到改革开放的现行政策不会变，也不应该变时，侨胞代表报以热烈的掌声。
    李鹏最后引用“生意兴隆通四海，财源茂盛达三江”这一名句，祝愿旅日华侨合家幸福，生意兴隆，会场上又响起了长时间的热烈掌声。
    来自东京、札幌、大阪、神户、长崎、福冈等日本各地的侨领，其中包括台湾省籍侨领和各界知名人士２００多人参加了会见。
