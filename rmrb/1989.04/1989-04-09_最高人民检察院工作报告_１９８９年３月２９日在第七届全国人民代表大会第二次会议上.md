The Supreme People's Procuratorate Work Report
— March 29, 1989, at the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress
Liu Fuzhi, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate

Comrades and Deputies:

Now, I will report on the main work of the procuratorate over the past year and request your review.

I. Situation of Cracking Down on Bribery and Embezzlement Crimes

Since the First Session of the Seventh National People's Congress, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, in accordance with the spirit of the Congress on strengthening socialist democracy and socialist legal system, has performed its legal supervision duties as stipulated by the Constitution. It has led local procuratorates and specialized procuratorates at all levels to actively participate in the construction of clean government and launched a campaign to crack down on bribery and embezzlement crimes. We have prioritized this campaign as the first major task in the procuratorate's fight against economic crimes and have achieved certain results.

According to statistics, in 1988, procuratorates across the country accepted 36,500+ embezzlement cases and initiated investigations into 16,200+ cases (the standard for filing a case is 1,000 yuan and above). The number of cases filed has decreased by 13% compared to 1987. They accepted 9,200+ bribery cases and initiated investigations into 4,800+ cases (the standard for filing a case is the same as above). The number of cases filed has increased by 0.8% compared to the previous year. The total number of embezzlement and bribery cases accepted is 45,700+, with 21,100+ cases filed. The number of cases filed has decreased by 10.4% compared to the previous year. Throughout the year, a total of 2,900+ cases involving embezzlement or bribery of 100,000 yuan or more were handled, a decrease of 6.8% compared to the previous year. A total of 8,777 suspects were arrested, and 10,356 suspects were prosecuted by the people's courts (including accumulated cases from 1987). By the end of 1988, judgments had been received for 5,911 suspects, with 5,642 sentenced to imprisonment or more severe penalties, including 74 sentenced to life imprisonment or more severe penalties. Among those sentenced, there were 190 county-level cadres and 4 division-level cadres; 3,754 Communist Party members. In the fourth quarter of last year, in accordance with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which emphasized improving the economic environment and rectifying economic order, we adjusted our work deployment and clearly listed the fight against bribery and embezzlement crimes as a key task. Since then, procuratorates across the country have seen a significant increase in the number of embezzlement and bribery cases accepted and filed, with major cases being particularly prominent. In the fourth quarter, 732 major embezzlement cases were filed, an increase of 28.4% compared to the third quarter; 191 major bribery cases were filed, an increase of 50.4% compared to the third quarter.

In the campaign to crack down on bribery and embezzlement crimes, the procuratorate focused on the following tasks:

First, we launched a campaign to encourage and rely on the masses to report and accuse bribery and embezzlement crimes. In May 1988, the Supreme People's Procuratorate promoted the experience of the Shenzhen Municipal Procuratorate in establishing a reporting center. Since July of the same year, procuratorates at all levels across the country have successively established reporting agencies. By the end of 1988, 2,784 procuratorates had established reporting centers (stations) or set up reporting hotlines, and 158 large and medium-sized cities had established reporting centers. In the second half of 1988, various reporting agencies accepted a total of 147,000+ reports, most of which were within the scope of party and administrative discipline and had been transferred to relevant departments for handling; 52,000+ reports involved embezzlement and bribery issues, and the procuratorate is currently investigating, with 5,700+ cases already filed for investigation, including 1,500+ major cases involving 100,000 yuan or more. Through the reporting channels, the number of major cases filed for investigation accounted for 50% of the total number of embezzlement and bribery major cases filed for investigation by the procuratorate, totaling 2,900+. These facts show that the reporting work has played a significant role in the fight against embezzlement and bribery crimes. Most of the major cases exposed in the newspapers were solved through reporting leads. Over the past six months, we have investigated issues involving 241 division-level cadres. Preliminary findings: 15 cases were confirmed (8 cases have been filed, 2 arrested, 1 prosecuted); 88 cases are still under investigation; 115 cases are within the scope of party and administrative discipline and have been transferred to relevant departments for handling; 23 cases were found to be false reports. Among the reporting materials, 19 division-level and ministerial-level cadres were involved, with 4 cases still under investigation; 11 cases are within the scope of party and administrative discipline and have been transferred to relevant departments for handling; 4 cases were found to be false reports.

The masses' reports have provided the procuratorate with a large number of valuable case leads, greatly strengthening the procuratorate's mass base in the fight against embezzlement and bribery crimes, and promoting the work of accepting complaints and appeals. Last year, procuratorates at all levels across the country accepted a total of 934,025 complaints and appeals (times), and handled a large number of issues directly reflected by the masses. In the process of reporting work, we emphasized the need to focus on "timely handling" and "information feedback" as the central link. Currently, the reporting work has begun to form a certain momentum and has initially shown its strength. In the second half of 1988, 650+ people across the country surrendered to the procuratorate with illicit money and goods, totaling 6.23 million+ yuan. The procuratorate and the people's courts have given lenient treatment to those who surrendered and confessed according to law. Practice has proven that the reporting work is very effective. On one hand, it has created convenient conditions for the masses to exercise their right to complain and appeal; on the other hand, it has opened up an effective channel for the procuratorate to rely on the masses to fight against embezzlement and bribery crimes.

Second, procurator-generals at all levels have personally handled cases and focused on investigating major and important cases. In April last year, we required procuratorates at all levels to lead by example in handling cases and to focus on investigating major and important cases and cases with interference. Procurator-generals should set an example by personally participating in the first line of case handling, seriously guiding investigation, evidence collection, analysis, research, and review, helping to eliminate interference, and solving difficulties. Many procurator-generals did this, participating in the entire process of case review before filing, investigation after filing, decision to arrest, preliminary examination, review of prosecution, and court prosecution. They have implemented effective leadership and taken the initiative. There are currently 10,250+ procurator-generals and deputy procurator-generals nationwide, with 7,000+ personally participating in case handling. Over the past year, the Supreme People's Procuratorate sent 27 case-handling teams to various places, with procurator-generals, deputy procurator-generals, and 30+ procurators, 50+ assistant procurators participating in this work. Procuratorates in provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government have dispatched nearly 1,000 procurators to grassroots procuratorates to participate in and assist in case handling. This has played a role in promoting the fight against embezzlement and bribery crimes.

Third, we concentrated manpower and resources to handle more cases and major cases. Where this was done, the effect was relatively good. According to reports from procuratorates in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and other places, the number of embezzlement and bribery crime cases handled in 1988 increased by about 10% compared to 1987, and the number of major and important cases increased by about 15%; in the second half of last year, the number of major and important embezzlement cases filed for investigation increased by about 11% compared to the first half, and the number of major and important bribery cases increased by about 74%.

Fourth, we strengthened cooperation with various levels of party disciplinary committees, government supervision, auditing, commerce, taxation, customs, and other administrative law enforcement departments, combining legal supervision with party discipline supervision and administrative supervision. The Supreme People's Procuratorate has successively issued notices with the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China and the Ministry of Supervision on strengthening cooperation and coordination, and has established a system for timely transfer of cases with other relevant departments. This cooperative and collaborative system has played a good role in timely discovering and handling crimes.

Fifth, we emphasized the need to adhere to the principle of being resolute and cautious, and to ensure accuracy. We required procuratorates at all levels to regard case quality as the lifeblood of procuratorial work. In actual work, procuratorates at all levels concentrated their efforts on investigation work, with the main goal of obtaining conclusive evidence; they handled cases with unclear legal boundaries, unclear policy boundaries, and differing opinions with caution; they resolutely corrected the erroneous practice of "arresting instead of investigating," and strictly controlled the arrest and prosecution thresholds.

At the same time, the procuratorate also closely cooperated with tax, financial, and price inspections, discovering and handling economic crime cases. Last year, procuratorates across the country handled 4,479 tax evasion and resistance cases, 430 counterfeit trademark cases, and 309 embezzlement of public funds cases. Through the handling of these cases, the state's tax collection and commercial management order were maintained.

In 1988, procuratorates across the country accepted a total of 66,300+ cases, including embezzlement, bribery, tax evasion, and resistance, among others, an increase of 11% compared to the previous year, and filed 31,200+ cases for investigation (including 65% embezzlement and bribery cases), an increase of 0.9% compared to the previous year, seizing a total of 423 million+ yuan in illicit money and goods (converted to currency).

To handle cases involving speculation and profiteering by enterprises, institutions, government agencies, and organizations, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, in conjunction with the Supreme People's Court, formulated and issued judicial interpretations on the handling of speculation and profiteering cases by enterprises, institutions, government agencies, and organizations. According to statistics, from October 1988 to January this year, procuratorates across the country approved the arrest of 480 speculators and profiteers, including 74 major criminals; prosecuted 206 cases involving 388 people, and did not prosecute 50 cases involving 111 people. For some state functionaries who used their power to facilitate speculation and profiteering activities and committed embezzlement and bribery crimes, the procuratorate accepted and handled the cases according to law.

From the problems that have been exposed, the current bribery and embezzlement crimes have the following five prominent features: First, the amount of bribery and embezzlement is large. According to statistics on cases filed for investigation in 1988, there were 122 cases of embezzlement and bribery involving 100,000 to 500,000 yuan, 22 cases involving 500,000 to 1 million yuan, and 15 cases involving more than 1 million yuan. Such a large number of embezzlement and bribery cases involving huge sums of money have never been seen before. Second, there are many people at the grassroots level who have actual power over money and goods, with nearly 70% of the criminals being managers, accountants, and procurement personnel of enterprises and institutions. Third, many cases occur in the banking, construction, grain, supply and marketing, and materials systems. Fourth, the methods of committing crimes are cunning and deceitful, with bribery and acceptance often being group crimes, and more often being single-line contacts, often leaving no scene or traces, making investigation and evidence collection very difficult. Fifth, there are increasing cases of embezzlement and bribery in foreign economic activities. Some criminals demand or accept bribes from foreign and overseas businessmen, and the amount of crime is large, with some criminals fleeing with the money after committing the crime.

From the problems that have been exposed, the situation of bribery and embezzlement crimes is serious and harmful, and the masses are deeply disgusted. Since the severe crackdown on serious economic crimes in 1982, over the past seven years, the procuratorate has filed and investigated nearly 160,000 embezzlement and bribery cases, including 127,000+ embezzlement cases and 31,000+ bribery cases. Among the criminals, some are repeat offenders, but the vast majority have fallen and committed crimes in the atmosphere of "everything for money." They are bewitched by money, forget righteousness for profit, exchange power for money, and brazenly embezzle socialist property, sabotage the Four Modernizations, hinder the implementation of reform and opening-up policies, poison social customs, and tarnish the reputation of the Party and the government. They are termites and pests in the socialist edifice. We believe that in the primary stage of socialism, in the development of a planned commodity economy, there are objectively conditions for the breeding and spread of bribery and embezzlement. The fight against bribery and embezzlement is a struggle against corruption. The procuratorate must insist on long-term struggle and must insist on severely punishing bribery and embezzlement criminals and other serious economic criminals according to law.

From the problems that have been exposed, it can be said that the cadres of the Party and state organs are generally clean and law-abiding. Those who have fallen into bribery and embezzlement criminals are always a minority. Of course, we cannot relax our fight against bribery and embezzlement crimes because of this, nor can we relax clean government education and construction. The procuratorate sincerely welcomes and seriously accepts reports from any side and any individual about bribery and embezzlement issues, and hopes that they will speak out without reservation. No matter whose bribery and embezzlement issues are involved, the procuratorate will definitely investigate them seriously, be loyal to the facts and the law, handle cases impartially, and will not be lenient. We protect informants according to law and severely punish those who dare to retaliate, while also being vigilant against those who make false accusations. The procuratorate will definitely insist on independently exercising procuratorial power according to law, strictly handle cases according to law, be able to overcome the phenomenon of substituting speech for law and power for law, and also be able to eliminate interference that ignores facts and is irresponsible. The procuratorate insists on the socialist legal principle of equality before the law, with facts as the basis and the law as the criterion, enforcing the law strictly, executing the law strictly, and investigating the law strictly, to ensure that the cases we handle can withstand the test of history.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and the State Council attach great importance to strengthening clean government construction and eliminating corruption. The broad masses are very concerned about and support the handling of bribery and embezzlement crime cases. This has created favorable conditions for the work of the procuratorate. Article 13, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law of our country stipulates: "Embezzlement crimes, crimes against citizens' democratic rights, dereliction of duty crimes, and other cases that the people's procuratorate deems necessary to handle directly shall be investigated and decided by the people's procuratorate whether to prosecute." According to this, directly accepting, filing, and investigating embezzlement and bribery and other duty-related crime cases is an important responsibility assigned to the procuratorate by law and an important task that the procuratorate must fulfill. In 1988, although the procuratorate did a lot of work in the fight against bribery and embezzlement crimes, there were also some shortcomings and problems, the most prominent of which was the low efficiency of case handling, mainly due to the fact that the Supreme People's Procuratorate's supervision, inspection, and guidance were not strong enough; some local handling work was not tight enough. In 1989, we will be spirited, continue to deepen the fight against bribery and embezzlement crimes, and focus on handling major and important cases, strengthening investigation and preliminary examination work, and strengthening the construction of investigation facilities. We will seriously summarize experience, strengthen the construction of anti-corruption agencies, cultivate anti-corruption and anti-bribery experts, promote clean government construction, and achieve significant results in reducing the harm of bribery and embezzlement crimes to the lowest possible level.

II. Situation of Cracking Down on Criminal Activities

Cracking down on criminal activities has always been a key task of the procuratorate. Over the past year, the procuratorate has closely cooperated with the public security organs and the people's courts, resolutely implemented the policy of severe and swift punishment according to law, and continued to severely crack down on serious criminal elements. In 1988, procuratorates across the country accepted 472,361 suspects for arrest approval requested by the public security organs, and after review, approved the arrest of 404,386 suspects, an increase of 20.3% compared to 1987. They accepted 441,480 suspects for prosecution requested by the public security organs, and after review, prosecuted 381,202 suspects, an increase of 16.2% compared to 1987. By the end of 1988, they had received judgments from the people's courts for 319,130 suspects prosecuted by the procuratorate, with 318,446 found guilty. Procuratorates at all levels, in the process of investigation supervision and trial supervision, pursued and prosecuted 12,073 criminals. Among the several categories of serious criminals approved for arrest, there were 12,041 murderers, an increase of 11% compared to 1987; 43,829 robbers, an increase of 59.9%; 25,084 intentional injury criminals, an increase of 7.8%; 38,748 major theft criminals, an increase of 75.8%; and 30,112 rapists, a decrease of 14.1%. The above statistics show that ordinary criminal cases are on the rise, with murder, robbery, and major theft cases showing a significant increase.

Over the past year, in the fight against criminal activities, the procuratorate mainly did the following five tasks:

1. In response to the characteristics of criminal activities in various places and the prominent problems in public security, together with relevant departments, we launched different scales and contents of special campaigns at the right time to reduce the harm that criminal activities bring to social order and public safety, and to stabilize public order.

2. In cooperation with the public security organs, we generally implemented the system of early intervention in the investigation and preliminary examination of major criminal cases. According to statistics from procuratorates in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Liaoning, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hubei, Shandong, Guangdong, Guangxi, and 10 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, in 1988, there were 16,950+ instances of early intervention in investigation activities. Early intervention in investigation and preliminary examination activities has achieved good results, which is conducive to mutual restraint and cooperation, correct implementation of the law, ensuring case quality, and accurately striking at criminals; at the same time, it is conducive to strengthening legal supervision of investigation activities.

3. In the process of investigation supervision and trial supervision, the procuratorate made non-arrest decisions for 39,997 people who were requested by the public security organs for arrest but did not meet the statutory arrest conditions after review; made non-prosecution decisions for 2,720 people who were transferred by the public security organs for prosecution but were found not to constitute a crime after review. They rectified 4,982 instances of illegal behavior in the public security organs' investigation activities; rectified 1,918 instances of illegal behavior in the people's courts' trial activities. They lodged protests against 1,779 judgments and rulings of the people's courts that the procuratorate believed were erroneous, and by the end of 1988, had received 453 judgments and rulings of the people's courts to change the original verdict and 268 judgments and rulings to maintain the original verdict.

4. In case handling, we emphasized the word "accuracy." In early 1988, the Supreme People's Procuratorate issued a notice to improve the quality of arrest and prosecution work. We required strict review of evidence, accurate implementation of the law, and mastery of the boundary between crime and non-crime, doing neither too much nor too little. The nationwide arrest accuracy rate reached 99.5%, and the prosecution case accuracy rate reached 99.8%.

5. We supported the correct exercise of the right to self-defense, protected and encouraged the initiative to fight against criminal behavior. For those who, in the face of serious threats to state property, their own lives, and the lives and property of others from criminal behavior, defended themselves according to law, especially those who were injured or killed criminals while performing their duties according to law, the procuratorate resolutely gave them legal protection and used typical cases to publicize the law, commend advanced individuals and deeds who dared to do good, and encourage people to understand the legal significance of self-defense and dare to fight against criminals face to face.

The overall situation of our country is good and stable. However, in terms of public security, the situation is quite severe. At present, many cities, railways, highways, and coastal open areas have seen an increase in criminal cases, with criminal activities being quite prominent; murder, robbery, injury, theft, and hooliganism that seriously endanger social order have increased in proportion, with many theft crimes and roaming crimes. Prostitution, trafficking of women and children, spreading obscene materials, and gambling have not been effectively curbed, and there are many complaints from the masses. Our country is in the primary stage of socialism, and we are currently in the process of transitioning from the old to the new economic system, with many social contradictions and unstable factors. Among the social contradictions, there are many people's internal contradictions, and some are quite sharp. In our society, the contradiction between us and the enemy still exists objectively and cannot be ignored. We must see that there are still some criminals in our country who are enemies of the people and enemies of society, who are eager for chaos and try to sabotage social stability and socialist construction, and who try to split the motherland. There are also foreign and overseas spies and special agents who are constantly sent to our country. Faced with this complex situation, procuratorates at all levels and the broad procuratorial personnel must pay close attention to the trends in public security, correctly understand the situation, and maintain a clear mind and vigilance.

The many new situations and problems that have emerged in public security have complex causes. We believe that objectively, our society still has conditions that induce and nurture criminal activities. In the new situation of opening up to the outside world, some negative things have also been brought in. Subjectively, our legal system is not yet perfect, various rules and regulations are not yet complete, management work is lagging behind, comprehensive measures for public security governance are not being implemented, and there are varying degrees of phenomena of not enforcing the law and not enforcing the law strictly among some procuratorial personnel, which are also important reasons. Therefore, solving this problem is a long-term, arduous, and complex systematic project that requires the joint efforts of the whole society. The procuratorate and all procuratorial personnel must strive to improve their work, be loyal to their duties, strictly enforce the law, and do their own work well.

According to the spirit of the national political and legal work conference recently convened by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, in 1989, the procuratorate will unswervingly implement the policy of severe and swift punishment according to law for serious criminal elements and severe punishment according to law for serious economic criminals. In maintaining public order, we will closely cooperate with relevant departments, adopt measures of concentrated crackdown and concentrated rectification, and focus on the fight against criminal activities in large and medium-sized cities, transportation lines, and coastal open areas; combine case handling with comprehensive governance work, especially the comprehensive governance of juvenile crime, and timely propose procuratorial suggestions to relevant departments and units, and help the units where the cases occurred to establish and improve rules and regulations, plug loopholes, and prevent crimes.

Over the past year, the supervision of prisons and detention centers has strengthened the legal supervision of the execution of judgments and rulings in criminal cases and the activities in places of detention and reform. There are 59 procuratorial offices set up in the areas of detention and reform, and more than 580 procuratorial teams stationed in the field. The procuratorial departments of prisons and detention centers, in cooperation with the detention and reform departments, have timely cracked down on criminal activities by reformed criminals and re-education personnel during the reform period, and prosecuted 5,921 cases of reformed criminals committing crimes again and re-education personnel committing crimes. For cases of corporal punishment, abuse, and dereliction of duty that occurred in places of detention and reform, the procuratorate has conducted legal investigations and prosecutions. Last year, a total of 159 cases of crimes committed by prison and detention center personnel were filed for investigation, with 71 people already sentenced to penalties. At the same time, the procuratorate has seriously handled the appeals of reformed criminals and re-education personnel, and made the relevant departments correct the wrong or inappropriate judgments and decisions made for 569 reformed criminals and 60 re-education personnel.

III. Situation of Handling Cases of Violating Citizens' Democratic Rights

To strengthen the procuratorial work of protecting citizens' democratic rights, the Supreme People's Procuratorate has established the Law and Discipline Procuratorial Bureau, and procuratorates at all levels have improved the law and discipline procuratorial agencies. Throughout the year, a total of 40,450+ cases of various law and discipline crimes were accepted, an increase of 7.8% compared to 1987, and 12,000+ cases were filed for investigation, an increase of 10.2% compared to 1987. Among the cases filed for investigation, there were 4,700+ cases of judicial personnel and grassroots cadres violating citizens' democratic rights and personal rights, an increase of 17.4% compared to 1987, including 167 cases of torture, 254 cases of false accusation, and 2,498 cases of illegal detention. Among these cases of violating citizens' democratic rights and personal rights, there were 227 major cases resulting in injury or death. There were 8,000+ cases of dereliction of duty and major responsibility accidents caused by state organ personnel and management personnel of enterprises and institutions due to serious dereliction of duty or illegal operation, resulting in the loss of people's lives and state property, with 5,204 deaths and direct economic losses of 320 million yuan. Among the dereliction of duty crime cases, 65 county-level cadres and 5 division-level cadres were held criminally responsible.

The cases handled by the law and discipline procuratorial agencies are mainly cases of state organ personnel, judicial personnel, and grassroots cadres using their power to violate citizens' rights. In the process of handling cases and eliminating interference, we have received the support of party and government organs, the National People's Congress and its Standing Committees at all levels. The procuratorate's handling of cases of violating citizens' democratic rights, personal rights, and dereliction of duty is an important work to promote the construction of socialist democratic politics. In the future, we will further strengthen the handling of major and important cases, and for those who violate the criminal law, no matter how high their position is, we will uphold the law and maintain the unified implementation of the law.

To improve the procuratorial legal supervision function, we have carried out pilot work on the legal supervision of the civil and administrative trial activities of the people's courts in a few grassroots procuratorates according to the provisions of the Civil Procedure Law (Trial Implementation). With the support of the local people's congresses and their standing committees and the people's courts, we have gained some useful experience. Currently, we are reviewing and summarizing, so that the pilot work can be carried out steadily and legally, and the legal supervision responsibilities can be correctly fulfilled.

IV. Law Enforcement Situation and Team Building

The procuratorate is a state legal supervision agency. To improve the level of law enforcement, summarize experience and lessons, and enhance the quality of the team, in the second half of 1988, procuratorates at all levels conducted a comprehensive inspection of the implementation of the Constitution, Criminal Law, Criminal Procedure Law, and the Organic Law of the People's Procuratorate. Generally speaking, the quality of the procuratorial team is good, the implementation of the law and the performance of legal supervision duties are serious, the broad procuratorial personnel work diligently, and the level of law enforcement and case handling quality has improved, making contributions to maintaining the dignity of state law. However, our work also has many problems that cannot be ignored:

1. A few cases have improper application of the law and incorrect classification. In 1988, among the cases accepted for arrest approval requested by the public security organs, 276 were wrongly approved for arrest; among the economic crime cases investigated by the procuratorate, 130 were found not guilty after being prosecuted by the court. Among the cases decided by the procuratorate to be exempt from prosecution, it was found that there were cases of improper exemption from prosecution: some should have been prosecuted but were wrongly exempted from prosecution; some did not constitute a crime but were wrongly exempted from prosecution. The occurrence of these shortcomings and problems is related to the fact that the Supreme People's Procuratorate's guidance was not timely and effective; we believe that this is a relatively serious problem. For the cases found to have problems, although they were all seriously corrected according to law after re-examination and verification, we should summarize the lessons and improve future work.

2. The situation of exceeding the case handling period is quite prominent. In the review and prosecution of criminal cases, 705 cases exceeded the period, and 1,888 cases of criminal cases investigated by the procuratorate exceeded the period. The main reasons for this situation are that some procuratorial personnel have weak legal awareness; the level of legal policy is not high, and the ability to accurately judge between crime and non-crime is still weak; the case handling funds and forces are insufficient, the investigation means are lacking and outdated, and the transportation and communication equipment are backward, which also affects the timely collection of evidence and case closure.

3. Among some procuratorial personnel, there have been serious illegal and disciplinary violations, bribery, bullying, and beating of the masses, which have damaged the procuratorial organs' strict law enforcement, and have directly harmed society. According to statistics, in 1988, 340 procuratorial personnel were given party and administrative disciplinary sanctions and criminal penalties, including 9 who were dismissed from public office, 22 who were expelled from the party, and 60 who were held criminally responsible.

4. Some procuratorial organs' leaders cannot adhere to the principle of equality before the law, and some even abandon the law enforcement position and lack the courage to independently exercise procuratorial power according to law. At the same time, there are also phenomena of procuratorial personnel being treated unfairly or even being retaliated against for upholding the law. After the Supreme People's Procuratorate discovered such incidents, it directly intervened and supported the procuratorial personnel who upheld the law, and resolutely fought against all lawless acts.

In 1989, the procuratorate will continue to deepen the reform, further implement the Organic Law of the People's Procuratorate, perform legal supervision duties, strengthen and improve the leadership system of the procuratorial organs from top to bottom; improve the specific procedures of legal supervision; focus on the training and training of procuratorial personnel, strengthen institutional construction, and make greater efforts to build a socialist rule-of-law society.

First, we must resolutely implement the line, principles, and policies of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, consciously accept the leadership of the Party, adhere to the four cardinal principles, serve reform and opening up, serve the establishment of a new order of socialist planned commodity economy, and serve socialist modernization construction.

Second, we must consciously accept the supervision of the National People's Congress and its Standing Committees. Procuratorates at all levels must seriously and seriously implement the Constitution and enforce the law. We must regularly report our work to the people's congresses, and for major issues, we must report to the Standing Committees of the people's congresses in a timely manner, so that the procuratorial work can be supervised and supported in a timely manner. The procuratorate welcomes the inspection of procuratorial work by deputies to the people's congresses and members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and we will seriously handle and promptly respond to the opinions and suggestions they put forward, and make them institutionalized.

Third, we must accept the supervision of the masses and public opinion supervision, and increase the transparency of procuratorial work. The Supreme People's Procuratorate has promulgated the "Several Provisions on the Reporting Work of the People's Procuratorate" and made public the reporting work procedures. We will also make public other work procedures. We will insist on the spokesperson system and introduce the procuratorial work situation to the broad masses through the news media, feedback the handling situation of the masses' reports, listen to the opinions of all sectors of society, and promptly discover and correct the shortcomings and errors in the work.

Fourth, establish and improve the internal restraint system. First, continue to implement the power separation system for cases investigated by the procuratorate, that is, separate investigation, preliminary examination, and decision to arrest and prosecute, and manage them by two departments respectively, to eliminate the disadvantages of excessive concentration of power, so that all business activities are subject to restraint; second, implement the filing and filing system for cases exempt from prosecution, that is, all cases exempt from prosecution should be filed and filed with the higher-level procuratorate, and the higher-level procuratorate has the right to change, revoke, or order correction if it finds that the exemption from prosecution decision is not timely; third, implement the system of appeal review and handling by the higher-level procuratorate, that is, for important appeals that are not satisfied with the procuratorial decision, they are not handled by the original decision-making organ, but by the higher-level procuratorial control and appeal department.

Fifth, reform and improve the procuratorial system, and accelerate the standardization and institutionalization of procuratorial legal supervision. To build a procuratorial system with Chinese characteristics, the Supreme People's Procuratorate has reformed and adjusted the business agencies, implemented the "three definitions," and has already drafted the "Draft Procurator Law," which is currently being revised after soliciting opinions. It will be submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation after it is relatively mature.

Sixth, vigorously strengthen team building and improve the political, professional, and especially legal qualities of procuratorial personnel. This is a strategic task for the procuratorate. We will insist on the principle of "strictly managing the procuratorate," strictly manage the procuratorate, strictly require procuratorial personnel, and seriously handle various illegal and disciplinary violations within the procuratorate. To improve the quality of procuratorial personnel, we will continue to hold various levels of professional training classes. The Supreme People's Procuratorate has established the Senior Procurator Training Center and is preparing to establish the Central Procuratorial College.

At the national procuratorial chiefs' work conference held in November 1988, we required procuratorates at all levels to continue to combine the improvement of the procuratorial organs' law enforcement level and team building, and insist on the system of annual law enforcement inspection. At the same time, we required that in all work, we should implement the spirit of reform, and truly strengthen the organizational construction of the team, especially the grassroots construction; strengthen ideological and political work, and focus on educating the basic line of the Party, the one center and two basic points; commend advanced individuals and units who uphold the law. We must strictly discipline the team, keep it clean, maintain integrity, and carry forward the good style of "uprightness and clean hands," and forge the procuratorial team into a team that strictly enforces the law, upholds the law, understands the policy, seeks truth from facts, connects with the masses, and is proficient in the business, and build it into an important force for upholding people's democratic dictatorship.

Comrades and Deputies:

The reform of our country has achieved remarkable achievements that have attracted worldwide attention, injecting strong vitality into the development of the national economy, and strongly promoting the construction of national democratic politics and the legal system. The policy of rectifying the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and comprehensively deepening the reform determined by the Thirteenth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is being implemented and has achieved initial results. The further deepening and success of reform and opening up have created good conditions for strengthening and carrying out procuratorial work, and have also put forward higher requirements for the procuratorate. Procuratorates at all levels should, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, under the supervision of the National People's Congress and its Standing Committees, and with the support of the masses, faithfully perform the legal supervision duties, to ensure the unified and correct implementation of state laws, maintain the dignity of state law, safeguard the democratic rights and personal rights of citizens from being infringed upon, maintain stability and unity, and safeguard and promote the smooth progress of reform and construction!

　　最高人民检察院工作报告
    ——１９８９年３月２９日在第七届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上
    最高人民检察院检察长  刘复之各位代表：
    现在，我就一年来检察工作的主要情况向大会作报告，请予审议。
    一、打击贪污、受贿犯罪的情况
    第七届全国人民代表大会第一次会议以来，最高人民检察院根据大会关于加强社会主义民主和社会主义法制的精神，履行宪法赋予的法律监督职责，领导地方各级人民检察院和各级专门检察院，积极参加廉政建设，开展了打击贪污、受贿犯罪的斗争。我们把这一斗争列为检察机关打击经济犯罪的第一位工作，作为检察工作的一个重点来抓，并取得了一定成效。
    根据统计，１９８８年全国检察机关共受理贪污案件３６５００多件，已立案侦查１６２００多件（立案标准为１０００元以上），已立案数比１９８７年减少１３％；受理受贿案件９２００多件，立案侦查４８００多件（立案标准同上），已立案数比上年增加０．８％。贪污、受贿两项合计共受案４５７００多件，已立案２１１００多件，立案数比上年减少１０．４％。全年共查处万元以上贪污、受贿大案２９００多件，比上年减少６．８％。决定逮捕贪污、受贿人犯８７７７名，向人民法院提起公诉的人犯１０３５６名（含１９８７年度积存数），到１９８８年底，已收到人民法院对５９１１名人犯的判决，判处有期徒刑以上刑罚的５６４２名，其中判处无期徒刑以上刑罚的７４名。被判刑的县级干部１９０名，司局级干部４名；共产党员３７５４名。去年第四季度，根据中国共产党十三届三中全会强调治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序的精神，我们调整了工作部署，明确地把打击贪污、受贿犯罪列为工作重点之后，全国检察机关受理和立案的贪污、受贿罪案都有较大的增加，大案尤为明显。第四季度贪污大案立案７３２件，比第三季度增加２８．４％；受贿大案立案１９１件，比第三季度增加５０．４％。
    在开展打击贪污、受贿犯罪斗争中，检察机关重点抓了以下几项工作：
    第一，开展举报工作，发动和依靠群众检举控告贪污、受贿犯罪活动。１９８８年５月，最高人民检察院推广了深圳市检察院建立举报中心的经验。同年７月以后，全国各级检察院相继建立了举报机构。截至１９８８年底，全国有２７８４个检察院建立了举报中心（站）或设置举报电话，１５８个大中城市都建立了举报中心。１９８８年下半年各举报机构共受理举报材料１４７０００多件，大多数是属于党纪、政纪范围的，已转有关部门处理；反映贪污、受贿问题的有５２０００多件，检察机关正在进行调查，现已立案侦查的有５７００多件，万元以上的大案有１５００多件。通过举报渠道立案的大案数占检察机关立案侦查的全部贪污、受贿大案２９００多件的５０％。这些情况说明，举报工作在反贪污、受贿犯罪斗争中起到了显著作用。已经在报纸上披露的大案多是通过举报线索侦破的。半年来，我们调查了涉及２４１名司局级干部的问题。初步查明：属实的１５人（已立案８人，逮捕２人，起诉１人）；正在调查的８８人；属于党纪、政纪范围的１１５人，已转有关部门查处；属于举报不实的２３人。举报材料中涉及１９名省、部级干部，有４个人的问题正在调查；属于党纪、政纪范围的１１人，已转有关部门查处；属于举报不实的４人。
    群众举报，为检察机关提供了大量有价值的案件线索，有力地加强了检察机关开展反贪污、受贿犯罪斗争的群众基础，也推动了受理控告、申诉的工作。去年全国各级检察院共受理控告、申诉９３４０２５件（次），查处了群众直接反映的大量问题。在开展举报工作中，我们强调，必须抓紧“及时查处”和“信息反馈”这个中心环节。目前，举报工作开始形成了一定的声势，初步显示了它的威力。１９８８年下半年，全国有６５０多人携带赃款、赃物到检察机关投案、自首，金额总计６２３万多元。对投案的、自首的，检察机关和人民法院依法予以从宽处理。实践证明，举报工作的效果是很好的，一方面，为人民群众行使控告、申诉权利创造了方便条件；另一方面，给检察机关依靠群众打击贪污、受贿犯罪开辟了一个有效途径。
    第二，各级检察长带头办案，带头抓大案要案的侦查工作。去年４月，我们要求全国各级检察院的领导干部要带头办案，要重点查处大案要案和有干扰的案件。检察长要以身作则，亲自深入办案第一线，认真负责地指导调查、取证和分析、研究、审查证据的工作，帮助排除干扰，解决困难。不少地方的检察长这样做了，他们参加立案前的审查、立案后的侦查、决定逮捕、预审、审查起诉和出庭公诉等全过程的工作，实施了有效的领导，取得了主动权。全国现有各级正副检察长１０２５０多名，已有７０００多人亲自参加办案。过去一年中，最高人民检察院派往各地的办案组２７个，正副检察长和３０多名检察员、５０多名助理检察员参加了这项工作。各省、自治区、直辖市检察院抽调了近千名检察人员到基层检察院参加、帮助办案。这对开展反贪污、受贿犯罪斗争起到了推动作用。
    第三，集中人力物力多办案、办大案。凡是这样做的地方，效果都比较好。据北京、天津、上海、广东、浙江等检察院报告，１９８８年办理的贪污、受贿犯罪案件比１９８７年增加１０％左右，办理的大案要案增加１５％左右；去年下半年比上半年立案侦查的贪污大案要案增加１１％左右，受贿大案要案增加７４％左右。
    第四，加强了同各级党的纪委、政府的监察、审计、工商、税务、海关等行政执法部门的联系，使法律监督同党纪监督、行政监督结合起来。最高人民检察院先后同中共中央纪律检查委员会、国家监察部联合下发了关于加强配合和协作的通知，同其他各有关部门也建立了互相及时移送案件的制度。这种协作、配合制度，对及时发现和查处犯罪起了很好的作用。
    第五，强调必须坚持一要坚决，二要慎重，务必搞准的原则，严格依法办案。我们要求各级检察机关把办案质量看作是检察工作的生命。在实际工作中，各级检察机关集中力量开展侦查工作，以查获确凿的证据作为主要目标；慎重处理法律界限不明确、政策界限不清楚和意见有分歧的案件；坚决纠正“以捕代侦”的错误作法，把好决定逮捕关和起诉关。
    同时，检察机关还密切配合税收、财务、物价大检查，发现和查处经济犯罪案件。去年，全国检察机关查处偷税、抗税罪案４４７９件，假冒商标罪案４３０件，挪用公款罪案３０９件。通过查处这些案件，维护了国家税收和工商管理秩序。
    １９８８年，全国检察机关在打击经济犯罪中受理包括贪污、受贿、偷税、抗税等罪案在内的各类案件６６３００多件，比上年增加１１％，立案侦查３１２００多件（其中贪污、受贿罪案占６５％），比上年增加０．９％，查获赃款、赃物（折款）总计人民币４．２３亿多元。
    为了查处企事业单位、机关、团体经营活动中的投机倒把犯罪案件，最高人民检察院会同最高人民法院制定并公布了关于办理企事业单位、机关、团体投机倒把罪案的司法解释。据统计，１９８８年１０月至今年１月，全国检察机关共批准逮捕这类投机倒把人犯４８０人，其中重大案犯７４人；提起公诉２０６件３８８人，免予起诉５０件１１１人。对某些国家工作人员利用职权为投机倒把活动提供方便，从中进行贪污、受贿犯罪的，检察机关都依法受理，立案查处。
    从已经揭露的问题看，当前贪污、受贿犯罪主要有以下五个突出特点：一是贪污、受贿的金额大。根据对１９８８年立案侦查的案件的统计，贪污、受贿１０万至５０万元的１２２件，５０万至１００万元的２２件，１００万元以上的１５件。一年中查获这么多巨大金额的贪污、受贿案，是以往没有过的。二是基层掌管财物实权的人多，有近７０％的作案分子是企事业单位的厂长、经理、财会、采购等人员。三是发生在银行、建筑、粮食、供销、物资系统的多。四是作案手段诡秘狡猾，行贿、受贿有的是集团犯罪，更多的是采取单线联系，往往没有现场、不留痕迹，调查、取证的难度很大。五是在对外经济活动中的贪污、受贿案件增多。一些犯罪分子向国外、境外商人索取或接受他们的贿赂，而且犯罪金额大，有的作案后携款潜逃。
    从已经揭露的问题看，贪污、受贿犯罪的情况是严重的，危害很大，群众深恶痛绝。自从１９８２年开展严厉打击严重经济犯罪以来，７年间，检察机关共立案侦查了贪污、受贿罪案近１６万件，其中贪污案件１２．７万多件，受贿案件３．１万多件。犯罪分子中有的是惯犯，但绝大多数则是在“一切向钱看”的邪气中堕落、犯罪的。他们钱迷心窍，见利忘义，进行权力和金钱的交换，肆无忌惮地侵吞社会主义财产，破坏四化建设，危害改革、开放政策的实施，毒化社会风气，玷污党和政府的声誉。他们是社会主义大厦里的蛀虫、蟊贼。我们认为，在社会主义初级阶段，在发展有计划的商品经济中，客观上还存在着贪污、受贿现象滋生、蔓延的土壤。反贪污、受贿的斗争是腐蚀与反腐蚀的斗争。检察机关必须坚持长期斗争，必须坚持依法从严惩处贪污、受贿犯罪分子和其他严重经济犯罪分子。
    从已经揭露的问题看，总体上说，党和国家机关工作人员队伍是廉洁的，是奉公守法的。堕落为贪污、受贿犯罪分子的始终是少数。当然，我们不能因此而放松同贪污、受贿犯罪的斗争，不能放松为政清廉教育和廉政建设。检察机关竭诚欢迎和认真受理来自任何方面、任何个人关于贪污、受贿问题的举报，并且希望知无不言、言无不尽。不论涉及任何人的贪污、受贿问题，检察机关一定认真调查，忠于事实，忠于法律，秉公办案，绝不手软。我们对检举人提供法律保护，依法制裁敢于打击报复的人，同时也警惕诬告陷害者。检察机关一定坚持依法独立行使检察权，严格依法办案，能够克服以言代法、以权压法的现象，也能够排除不顾事实、不负责任的干扰。检察机关坚持公民在法律面前一律平等，以事实为根据、以法律为准绳，有法必依、执法必严、违法必究的社会主义法制原则，以保证我们办理的案件经得起历史的检验。
    中共中央、全国人大常委会、国务院十分重视加强廉政建设、消除腐败现象。广大群众非常关心和支持查处贪污、受贿犯罪案件。这给检察机关的工作创造了有利的条件。我国刑事诉讼法第１３条第二款规定：“贪污罪、侵犯公民民主权利罪、渎职罪以及人民检察院认为需要自己直接受理的其他案件，由人民检察院立案侦查和决定是否提起公诉。”据此，直接受理、立案侦查贪污、受贿等职务犯罪案件，是法律赋予检察机关的重要职责，是检察机关义不容辞的一项重要任务。１９８８年，检察机关在反贪污、受贿犯罪方面虽然做了不少工作，但也存在一些缺点和问题，突出的是办案效率不高，主要原因是最高人民检察院督促、检查、指导不够有力；部分地方查处工作抓得不紧。１９８９年，我们要振奋精神，继续深入开展反贪污、受贿犯罪的斗争，切实抓好举报工作，集中力量查处大案要案，加强侦查工作和预审工作，加强侦查设施建设。我们要认真总结经验，加强反贪污机构的建设，培养反贪污、反受贿专家，促进廉政建设，为实现把贪污、受贿犯罪的危害减少到最低限度这个战略目标，作出明显成效。
    二、打击刑事犯罪的情况
    打击刑事犯罪活动，历来是检察机关的工作重点。一年来，检察机关与公安机关、人民法院密切配合，坚决贯彻依法从重从快的方针，继续严厉打击严重刑事犯罪分子。１９８８年全国检察机关受理公安机关提请批准逮捕的人犯４７２３６１名，经过审查已批准逮捕４０４３８６名，比１９８７年增加２０．３％。受理公安机关移送起诉的人犯４４１４８０名，经过审查已提起公诉３８１２０２名，比１９８７年增加１６．２％，到１９８８年底，已收到人民法院对检察机关提起公诉的３１９１３０名人犯的判决，作有罪判决的３１８４４６名。各级检察机关在侦查监督、审判监督中，追捕、追诉犯罪分子１２０７３名。在批准逮捕的几类严重犯罪分子中，杀人犯１２０４１名，比１９８７年增加１１％；抢劫犯４３８２９名，增加５９．９％；故意伤害犯２５０８４名，增加７．８％；重大盗窃犯３８７４８名，增加７５．８％；强奸犯３０１１２名，减少１４．１％。上述统计数字表明，普通刑事犯罪案件是上升的，杀人、抢劫、重大盗窃这几类案件上升幅度很大。
    过去一年，检察机关在打击刑事犯罪方面，主要做了以下五项工作：
    １、针对各地刑事犯罪的特点和治安中的突出问题，与有关部门一道适时地开展了不同规模、不同内容的专项斗争，努力减少刑事犯罪给社会秩序和人民安全带来的危害，稳定治安秩序。
    ２、与公安机关密切配合，普遍实行了提前介入对重大刑事案件的侦查、预审活动的制度。据北京、天津、上海、辽宁、浙江、江苏、湖北、山东、广东、广西等１０个省、自治区、直辖市检察院的统计，１９８８年提前介入侦查活动１６９５０多次。提前介入侦查、预审活动，取得了好的效果，有利于互相制约、互相配合，正确执行法律，保证办案质量，准确地打击罪犯；同时，有利于加强对侦查活动的法律监督。
    ３、在侦查监督和审判监督过程中，检察机关对公安机关提请逮捕、经过审查不够法定逮捕条件的３９９９７人作了不批准逮捕决定；对公安机关移送起诉、经审查不构成犯罪的２７２０人作了不起诉决定。纠正公安机关侦查活动中的违法行为４９８２次；纠正人民法院审判活动中的违法行为１９１８次。对人民检察院认为人民法院确有错误的判决、裁定提出抗诉１７７９件，到１９８８年底，已收到人民法院改判４５３件、维持原判２６８件的判决和裁定。
    ４、在办案中突出一个“准”字。１９８８年初，最高人民检察院下达了提高批捕、起诉工作质量的通知。要求严格审查证据，准确执行法律，掌握区分罪与非罪的界限，做到不枉不纵。全年全国的批捕准确率达９９．５％，起诉案件准确率达９９．８％。
    ５、支持正确行使正当防卫的权利，保护和鼓励同犯罪行为作斗争的积极性。对在国家财产、本人和他人的生命、财产受到犯罪行为严重威胁的情况下，依法正当防卫，特别是依法执行公务时将犯罪分子击伤、击毙的行为，检察机关坚决给以法律保护，并运用典型事例宣传法制，表扬见义勇为的先进人物、先进事迹，使人们了解正当防卫的法律意义，勇于面对面地同犯罪分子作斗争。
    我们国家总的形势是好的，是安定团结的。但就社会治安方面来看，形势相当严峻。目前，不少城市、铁路、公路沿线和沿海开放地区刑事犯罪发案上升，犯罪活动相当突出；杀人、抢劫、伤害、盗窃、流氓滋扰等严重危害社会治安的犯罪比重增高，盗窃犯罪和流窜作案很多。卖淫嫖娼、拐卖妇女儿童、传播淫秽物品、聚众赌博等社会丑恶现象屡禁不止，群众意见很大。我国处在社会主义初级阶段，目前又正在进行新旧经济体制的交替，社会矛盾和不安定的因素很多。社会矛盾中大量是人民内部矛盾，也有敌我矛盾。人民内部矛盾各种各样，很复杂，其中有些表现得相当尖锐。在我们社会里，敌我矛盾仍然是一种不可忽视的客观存在。我们必须看到，国内还有一些以人民为敌、以社会为敌的刑事犯罪分子，有唯恐天下不乱、妄图破坏社会稳定和社会主义建设的刑事犯罪分子，有企图分裂祖国的刑事犯罪分子。国外、境外也还不断地向我们这里派遣间谍特务。面对这种复杂情况，各级检察院和广大检察人员，要密切注意社会治安动向，正确认识形势，保持清醒头脑和警惕性。
    当前，社会治安方面出现的许多新情况新问题，原因是复杂的。我们认为，客观上是因为我们社会还存在着诱发、滋长刑事犯罪的条件。在对外开放的新形势下，也带进了一些消极的东西。从主观上来看，我国的法制还不够健全，各种规章制度不够完善，管理工作跟不上，社会治安综合治理措施不落实，在少数检察人员中程度不同地存在有法不依、执法不严的现象，也是重要原因。因此，解决这个问题是一项长期、艰巨、复杂的系统工程，需要全社会的共同努力。检察机关和全体检察人员一定努力改进工作，忠于职守，严格执法，作好自己的工作。
    根据中共中央不久前召开的全国政法工作座谈会的精神，１９８９年，检察机关要坚定不移地依法从重从快打击严重刑事犯罪分子和依法从严惩处严重经济犯罪分子。在维护治安方面要同有关部门密切配合，采取集中打击、集中整顿的措施，着重抓好大中城市、交通干线和沿海开放地区打击刑事犯罪的斗争；结合办案，开展综合治理的有关工作，特别是对青少年犯罪的综合治理工作，适时向有关部门和单位提出检察建议，帮助发案单位建立健全规章制度，堵塞漏洞，预防犯罪。
    一年来，监所检察工作加强了对刑事案件判决、裁定的执行和监管改造场所活动的法律监督。在监管改造场所区域内设置的派出检察院有５９个，驻场检察组已有５８０多个。监所检察部门配合监管改造部门，及时打击了劳改犯、劳教人员在改造期间的犯罪活动，依法起诉劳改犯又犯罪和劳教人员犯罪案件５９２１件。对监管改造场所中发生的体罚、虐待劳改犯和劳教人员以及徇私舞弊、私放罪犯、玩忽职守等犯罪案件依法进行了查处。去年共立案侦查监管改造场所干警犯罪案件１５９件，其中有７１人已经被判处刑罚。同时，认真处理劳改犯和劳教人员的申诉案件，使有关部门对５６9名劳改人员、６０名劳教人员所作的错误或不当的判决和决定得到纠正。
    三、查处侵犯公民民主权利案件的情况
    为了加强保护公民民主权利的检察工作，最高人民检察院设置了法纪检察厅，各级检察院也健全了法纪检察机构。全年共受理各种法纪犯罪案件４０４５０多件，比１９８７年增加７．８％，立案侦查１２０００多件，比１９８７年增加１０．２％。在立案查处的案件中，司法工作人员和基层干部侵犯公民民主权利、人身权利案件４７００多件，比１９８７年增加１７．４％，其中，刑讯逼供案１６７件，诬告陷害案２５４件，非法拘禁案２４９８件。在这类侵犯公民民主权利、人身权利的案件中，致人伤残、死亡的重大案件２２７件。国家机关工作人员和企事业单位的管理人员因严重渎职或违章作业、瞎指挥，致使人民生命、国家财产蒙受重大损失的渎职和重大责任事故案８０００多件，造成死亡５２０４人，直接经济损失３．２亿元。在渎职犯罪案件中，有６５名处级干部，５名司局级干部被追究了刑事责任。
    法纪检察查处的案件，主要是国家机关工作人员、司法工作人员和基层干部利用职权侵犯公民权利的犯罪案件。我们在查处案件和排除干扰中，得到了各级党政机关、人民代表大会及其常委会的支持。检察机关查处侵犯公民民主权利、人身权利和渎职等职务犯罪案件，是促进社会主义民主政治建设的一项重要工作。今后要进一步加强大案要案的查处工作，对于触犯刑律的，不论其职位高低，都要秉公执法，维护法律的统一实施。
    为了完善检察机关的法律监督职能，我们依照民事诉讼法（试行）的规定，在少数基层检察院进行了对人民法院的民事、行政审判活动实行法律监督的试点工作。在当地人大常委会和人民法院的支持下，取得了一些有益的经验。目前正在进行回顾和总结，使试点工作依法稳步进行，正确履行法律监督职责。
    四、执法情况与队伍建设
    检察机关是国家的法律监督机关。为了提高执法水平，总结经验和教训，增强队伍素质，１９８８年下半年，各级检察机关对执行宪法、刑法、刑事诉讼法和人民检察院组织法的情况，进行了一次全面检查。从总的方面看，检察队伍的素质是好的，执行法律、履行法律监督职责是严肃的，广大检察人员勤奋工作，执法水平和办案质量有所提高，为维护国家法制的尊严作出了贡献。但是，我们的工作也存在不少不容忽视的问题：
    １、少数案件适用法律不当，定性不准。１９８８年，在受理公安机关提请逮捕的案件中，错批捕２７６人，检察机关自行侦查的经济犯罪案件中，提起公诉的案件经法院审理作出无罪判决的１３０人。检察机关决定免予起诉的案件中，发现有免予起诉不当的情况：有应该起诉而错误免予起诉的；也有本不构成犯罪而错误地免予起诉的。出现这些缺点和问题，与最高人民检察院在指导上不够及时和有力是有关系的；我们认为，这是比较严重的问题。对发现有问题的案件，经过复查核实虽然都认真依法作了纠正，但应当总结教训，切实改进今后的工作。
    ２、超过办案期限情况比较突出。在对刑事案件的审查起诉中，办案超过期限的７０５件，检察机关立案侦查的犯罪案件超过办案期限的１８８８件。造成这种情况的主要原因是少数检察人员法制观念薄弱；法律政策水平不高，准确判断罪与非罪的能力还不强；办案经费和办案力量不足，侦查手段缺乏和陈旧，交通、通讯等技术装备落后，也影响了及时取证和结案。
    ３、在少数检察人员中发生徇私舞弊、收受贿赂、耍威风、打骂群众等严重违法乱纪和犯罪行为，破坏检察机关严格依法办案，给社会带来直接危害。据统计，１９８８年受到党纪政纪处分和刑事处罚的检察人员有３４０人，其中，开除公职的９人，开除党籍的２２人，追究刑事责任的６０人。
    ４、个别检察院的领导不能坚持公民在法律面前一律平等的原则，有的甚至放弃执法立场，缺乏依法独立行使检察权的勇气。同时，也有检察人员因秉公执法而遭到不公正的待遇甚至被打击报复的现象。最高人民检察院发现这类事件后，都直接过问和支持秉公执法的检察人员，坚决同各种违反法制的行为作斗争。
    １９８９年，检察机关在继续深入改革中，要进一步贯彻人民检察院组织法，履行法律监督职责，加强和完善检察机关自上而下的领导体制；完善法律监督的具体程序；抓紧对检察人员的培养、训练，加强制度建设，为建设社会主义的法治社会作出更大努力。
    第一，要坚决贯彻中国共产党十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针和政策，自觉接受党的领导，坚持四项基本原则，坚持为改革开放服务，为建立社会主义有计划的商品经济新秩序服务，为社会主义现代化建设服务。
    第二，要自觉接受人民代表大会及其常委会的监督。各级检察机关要严肃认真地遵守宪法，执行法律。要定期向人大报告工作，重大问题要随时向人大常委会报告，使检察工作及时得到监督和支持。检察机关欢迎人大代表和政协委员视察工作，对提出的意见和建议，我们将认真处理，及时作出答复，并且使之制度化。
    第三，要接受人民群众的监督和舆论监督，增大检察工作的透明度。最高人民检察院公布了《人民检察院举报工作若干规定》，公开了举报工作办事制度。还要公布其他工作制度。坚持新闻发言人制度，通过新闻媒介向广大人民群众介绍检察工作情况，反馈人民群众举报案件的查处情况，听取社会各界的意见，及时发现和纠正工作中的缺点和错误。
    第四，建立和完善内部制约制度。一要继续贯彻实行检察机关自行侦查的犯罪案件的分权制，即把侦查、预审与决定逮捕、起诉分开，由两个部门分别管理，消除权力过于集中的弊病，使各项业务活动都受到制约；二要对免诉案件实行备案、备查制度，凡是免予起诉的案件，应报上一级检察院备案、备查，上一级检察院发现免诉决定不当时，有权变更、撤销或指令纠正；三要实行申诉由上一级检察院审查处理的制度，对于不服检察机关决定的重要申诉，不由原决定机关处理，而由上级检察院控告申诉部门审查处理。
    第五，改革和完善检察体制，加快检察机关法律监督规范化、制度化的步伐。为了建设有中国特色的检察制度，最高人民检察院改革和调整了业务机构，实行了“三定”，并已经起草了《检察官法（草稿）》，正在征求意见，进行研究修改，待比较成熟后，提请全国人大常委会审议。
    第六，大力加强队伍建设，提高检察人员的政治素质、业务素质特别是法律素质。这是检察机关一项战略任务。坚持“从严治检”的方针，严格治理检察机关，严格要求检察人员，严肃处理自身的各种违法乱纪事件。为了提高检察人员的素质，要继续举办各种层次的专业培训班。最高人民检察院已经建立高级检察官培训中心，正在筹建中央检察干部学院。
    在１９８８年１１月召开的全国检察长工作会议上，我们要求各级检察机关继续把提高检察机关的执法水平和队伍建设结合起来，坚持一年一次执法大检查的制度。同时，要求在各项工作中贯彻改革的精神，切实加强队伍的组织建设特别是基层建设；加强思想政治工作，着重进行党的基本路线的一个中心两个基本点的教育；表扬秉公执法的先进人物和先进单位。要严明纪律，纯洁队伍，保持廉洁，发扬“一身正气，两袖清风”的好作风，把检察队伍锻炼成为严格依法办案、秉公执法、掌握政策、实事求是、联系群众、精通业务的队伍，建设成为坚持人民民主专政的一支重要力量。
    各位代表：
    我国的改革取得了举世瞩目的巨大成就，为国民经济的发展注入了强大的活力，有力地推动了国家的民主政治和法制建设。中国共产党十三届三中全会确定的治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革的方针，正在贯彻落实，并已取得了初步的成效。改革、开放的进一步深入和成功，给加强和开展检察工作创造了良好的条件，也给检察机关提出了更高的要求。各级检察机关要在中国共产党的领导下，在各级人民代表大会及其常委会的监督下，在人民群众的支持下，忠实履行法律监督职责，为保障国家法律的统一和正确实施，维护国家法制的尊严，保障公民的民主权利、人身权利不受侵犯，维护安定团结，保卫和促进改革与建设的顺利进行做出新的贡献！（附图片）
