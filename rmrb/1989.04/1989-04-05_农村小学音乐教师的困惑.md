We have been working as music teachers in a rural primary school for four or five years. Currently, teaching music in rural primary schools is truly challenging! First and second-grade students can still be engaged with songs like "Wa Ha Ha" and "The Bookworm," which people call "old-fashioned." However, students in grades three to six are much harder to handle. When we teach songs like "Youth, Youth, the Spring of the Motherland" and "Catching Mudskippers," the students show little interest, and some even openly refuse to sing. Many students ask us to teach them popular songs like "Following the Feeling" and "Pink Memories." As soon as music class starts, they hand us handwritten copies of popular songs, leaving us in a difficult position. If we don't teach them, we fear it will dampen their enthusiasm for singing; if we do teach them, we worry that some songs might have a negative influence on their young, pure minds. With their limited weekly music classes, how can we bear to rush through them?

Our confusion in teaching primary school music is growing, and we hope to receive guidance from experts and colleagues.

　　农村小学音乐教师的困惑
    我们担任农村小学音乐教师工作已有四五年了。目前，农村小学音乐教学可真难啊！一二年级的小学生学唱一些《哇哈哈》、《读书郎》等被人们称“老掉牙”的歌曲倒还哄得住。可是，三至六年级的学生就难以对付了。我们教唱《少年少年，祖国的春天》、《捉泥鳅》这些歌曲时，学生们就没兴趣，有的学生甚至公开抗拒不唱。不少学生要求老师教一些流行歌曲，什么《跟着感觉走》、《粉红色的回忆》等。一上音乐课，他们就把手抄的流行歌曲交给我们，这让我们左右为难。不教吧，怕打击了学生学唱歌的积极性；教吧，又怕有些歌曲对幼小纯洁的心灵有不良影响。他们每星期少得可怜的音乐课，我们又怎忍心草草了之呢？
    我们在小学生音乐教学上的这种困惑有增无减，希望能得到专家、同行们的指点。
