The car we were in finally entered the war-torn city of Basra. Looking out through the glass stuck to the windows, we saw ruins and debris everywhere. Bulldozers, loaders, and transport vehicles were busy clearing the remnants of war. After turning a corner, the reporter noticed that the buildings on both sides of the street were gradually improving: the roofs blown off by artillery shells had been repaired, the walls riddled with bullet holes had been plastered with cement and sand, and the residents who had fled during the war were returning to their homes. The Sheldon Hotel where we stayed had also been renovated and was spotless. However, it was said that before this, the entire hotel did not have a single good piece of glass. The governor of Basra Province said at a press conference, "We have started implementing the reconstruction plan, and the entire Iraq is under reconstruction."

Eight years of war have resulted in heavy losses. According to the head of an oil finance company based in Washington, Iraq's reduced oil and non-oil income due to the war may have reached $90 billion. Now, Iraq not only has no foreign exchange reserves but also has $60 billion in foreign debt. In the face of difficulties in borrowing, the Iraqi government decided to prioritize the reconstruction of Basra and Fao to quickly repair oil facilities and increase oil revenue. President Saddam Hussein will personally oversee and supervise the project.

Basra is located on the west bank of the Arabian River and is Iraq's second-largest city, oil and chemical center, and largest port. During the Iran-Iraq War, this city, which brought Iraq enormous economic benefits, suffered unprecedented devastation. To restore Basra's former glory, the Iraqi government plans to spend $4.5 billion, drawing three divisions from the country's eight divisions to rebuild the city. The governor of Basra Province told reporters that President Saddam Hussein recently inspected Basra, approved the reconstruction plan, and made specific arrangements. The Ministry of Housing is responsible for bridge and canal construction; the local management department is responsible for updating and rebuilding the water supply system; a foreign company is responsible for underground pipelines, and other departments will provide assistance as needed. The governor said seriously, "There are too many bombed-out homes, and building a new one costs 3,000 dinars (1 dinar is approximately $3.2). But we still have to build, to let the residents scattered by the war move into free housing as soon as possible." The dredging plan for Basra Port and the Arabian River has been determined, and the Basra refinery with a production capacity of 10 million tons may be repaired and put into production in June this year.

Fao, a peninsula with an area of 850 square kilometers, is an important oil export port for Iraq. During the war, everything here was almost destroyed, leaving only large areas of palm tree trunks burned black by the fire, and a mosque full of bullet holes. When the reporter arrived in early April, a large number of builders had already gathered here. They still had guns on them, but they had already learned to operate bulldozers and road rollers. The destroyed roads were paved with asphalt and sand, and some had even been laid with foundations. They will also rebuild oil tanks, pipelines, and oil stations to resume exporting oil through the Gulf.

Iraq is a country with the second-largest oil reserves in the world. Before the war, it produced 4 million barrels of oil per day, of which 3 million barrels were exported through Fao Port. During the war, oil exports from Fao dropped sharply. If the reconstruction of Basra and Fao goes smoothly, by September 1989, Iraq will restore its daily production capacity of 4 million barrels. Within two years, it can easily produce 5 million barrels per day. Its oil income will undoubtedly provide abundant funds for economic reconstruction.

To quickly restore the economy damaged by the war, President Saddam Hussein has repeatedly emphasized the need to develop the private sector. He believes: "Whether now or in the future, Iraq must have private enterprises. 'If private enterprises do not exist, they must be recreated.' Under this major policy, Iraq has already privatized more than 50 state-owned enterprises, and government land has begun to be sold to private individuals. The government also encourages private businesses to engage in import and export trade to regulate the national market. The reporter saw in the Baghdad market that household appliances, which were previously in short supply, can now basically meet the needs of consumers. In a store full of black-and-white and color televisions, the owner told the reporter that a 20-inch color TV costs only 500 dinars.

During the short stay in Baghdad, the reporter also saw many foreign contracting companies' offices. A colleague from the Chinese Road and Bridge Corporation's office in Baghdad told the reporter that these companies were either rushed here after the ceasefire or had already set up camp during the war. For competitive purposes, the personnel sent by each company are elite forces. The Chinese Road and Bridge Corporation's office in Baghdad is a small, efficient team. These companies are gradually becoming an important force in helping Iraq quickly repair its homeland.

Of course, Iraq's reconstruction is not a matter of one or two years. According to Japanese experts, reconstruction will take 10 years and $60 billion. The governor of Basra Province told reporters that the Iraqi people are working hard to raise reconstruction funds, and President Saddam Hussein has taken the lead in donating three gold medals.

　　访重建中的伊拉克
    本报记者  何崇元
    我们乘坐的汽车终于驶进了饱经战火的巴士拉市，贴着车窗的玻璃往外看，这里残垣断壁，瓦砾遍地。推土机、装载机、运输车正忙于清扫战争的残迹。汽车转弯后记者发现，街道两旁的建筑慢慢好起来：被炮弹炸掉的房顶盖好了，弹痕累累的墙壁已经糊上了水泥、沙子，战争中逃散的居民纷纷返回了家园。我们下榻的谢尔顿饭店也修葺一新，窗明几净。可据说在这以前，整个饭店连一块好玻璃都没有。巴士拉省省长在记者招待会上说，“我们已经开始实施重建计划，整个伊拉克都在重建中。”
    ８年战争，损失惨重。据设在华盛顿的石油金融公司的负责人估计，伊拉克因战争减少的石油和非石油收入可能高达９００亿美元。如今，伊拉克不仅没有外汇储备，而且背上了６００亿美元的外债。在借贷困难的情况下，伊拉克政府决定，优先重建巴士拉和法奥，以尽快修复石油设施，增加石油收入。萨达姆总统要亲自指挥，监督工程进行。
    巴士拉位于阿拉伯河西岸，是伊拉克的第二大城市、石油化工中心、全国最大的港口。两伊战争中这座给伊拉克带来巨大经济利益的城市遭到了空前浩劫。为重现巴士拉昔日的风彩，伊拉克政府打算耗资４５亿美元，从全国８个军团中抽调３个军团重建这座城市。巴士拉省长对记者说，萨达姆总统最近视察巴士拉，审定了重建计划，并作了具体部署，住房部负责桥梁和水渠建设；地方管理部负责自来水系统更新和重建；一家外国公司负责地下管道，其它各部也随时提供帮助。省长先生一板一眼地说：“被炸的民房太多，而新盖一栋要３０００伊第（１伊第约合３．２美元）。但还是要盖，要让战争中离散的居民尽快住上免费住房。”巴士拉港和阿拉伯河的疏通计划已确定，具有１０万吨生产能力的巴士拉炼油厂今年６月也可能修复投产。
    法奥，一个面积为８５０平方公里的半岛，是伊拉克重要的石油输出港。战争期间，这里的一切几乎都被毁灭，只剩下大片被战火烧得像木炭一样的椰枣树干，和一座满身弹痕的清真寺。记者４月上旬到达时，这里已经集结了大批的建设者，他们身上还挂着枪，但已经学会了开推土机、压路机。被毁坏的公路铺上了沥青、沙子，有的则整出了路基。他们还将重建储油罐、油管和输油站，以便再度通过海湾出口石油。
    伊拉克是石油储量居世界第二位的国家。战前，它每天生产的４００万桶石油，有３００万桶是通过法奥港运出的。在战争期间，法奥石油出口剧降。如果巴士拉和法奥重建顺利，到１９８９年９月，伊拉克将恢复每天４００万桶的生产能力。２年内，它就可以轻松地每天生产５００万桶。其石油收入无疑会为经济重建提供丰厚的资金。
    为了尽快恢复受战争破坏的经济，萨达姆总统多次强调要发展私营企业。他认为：无论现在或者将来，伊拉克都必须有私人企业。“假如私营企业不复存在，就有必要重新创造”。在这一大政方针指导下，伊拉克已有５０多家国营企业私有化，政府土地也开始售给了私人。政府还鼓励私商做进出口生意，以调节全国市场。记者在巴格达市场上看到，过去奇缺的家用电器，现在基本上能满足消费者的需要。在一家摆满黑白、彩色电视机的商店里，主人告诉记者，一台２０英寸的彩电，５００伊第就够了。
    在巴格达停留的短暂时间里，记者还看到不少单家独户的外国承包公司的办事处。我国路桥公司驻巴办事处的同志告诉记者，这些公司有的是停火后匆匆赶来的，有的则早在战争期间就已安营扎寨。出于竞争的目的，各公司派出的人员都是精兵强将。我国路桥公司驻巴办事处就是一个精干的小班子。这些公司日渐成为伊拉克尽快修复家园的一支重要力量。
    当然，伊拉克重建不是一两年的事情。据日本专家估算，重建需用１０年时间、６００多亿美元。巴士拉省长告诉记者，伊拉克人民都在努力筹集重建资金，萨达姆总统带头捐献了３枚金质勋章。
