Recently, the Chaoyang District Public Security Bureau of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau has concentrated its efforts to crack down on illegal activities such as "black market currency exchange," "currency arbitrage," and the illegal sale of "delivery notes." In one operation, 28 suspects were apprehended on the spot.

	"Hey, buddy, got any 'greenbacks'?" Before the words were even out of his mouth, a large hand had already tightly grabbed him...

This scene was captured on February 20 at Chaoyang District's Yinhua Bridge in Beijing.
