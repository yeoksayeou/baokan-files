Kim Il Sung, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, today delivered a speech at the banquet welcoming Zhao Ziyang, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The following is a detailed summary:

Today, we are able to meet again with our close friend and comrade-in-arms, Zhao Ziyang, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, in Pyongyang, and to gather meaningfully together, which makes us very happy.

Respected Comrade Zhao Ziyang, when you were serving as the Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, you visited our country as your first overseas visit. Today, as the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, you are visiting our country again as your first overseas trip. This shows Zhao Ziyang's and the Communist Party of China's firm will to always cherish the deep-rooted friendship between the two peoples, forged in blood through long-term joint struggles, and to continue to uphold our revolutionary camaraderie. It also clearly demonstrates the fraternal and friendly relationship and combat friendship that bind our two parties and peoples together.

At this banquet, filled with the joy of a brotherly meeting and the comradely love between fighters, I, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, the Korean people, and myself, once again extend a warm welcome to our guest, Comrade Zhao Ziyang, and his entourage.

Comrade Zhao Ziyang's visit to our country this time is taking place in a year of great significance, marking the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries and the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Over the past 40 years, the peoples of the two countries have always stood together in the magnificent struggle for independence, self-reliance, and socialism, sharing joys and sorrows, overcoming difficulties, and passing through trials. We have walked together on the road to victory.

During the arduous period of our country's war of liberation, the fraternal Chinese people, under the banner of "Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, Defend the Homeland," sent the Volunteer Army composed of their finest sons to aid our struggle with their blood. Thus, the friendship between the two countries, which was deeply rooted in the fierce flames of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, has developed into an unparalleled, lofty combat brotherhood. This friendship has been continuously strengthened and developed with the flow of history into an unbreakable bond that no force can destroy. Today, the traditional friendship between the two countries is being further consolidated and developed according to the common aspirations and wishes of the peoples of the two countries. We are pleased with this.

Today, under the leadership of the seasoned leadership of the Communist Party of China, which has been tempered in long-term struggles and accumulated rich experience, the Chinese people are achieving great successes in their struggle to adhere to the four cardinal principles, deepen reforms and opening up, and build socialism with Chinese characteristics. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese government, based on an independent and peaceful foreign policy, are actively struggling to develop friendly relations among the peoples of the world and to establish a just international order. Therefore, they enjoy a high reputation on the international stage and have made a great contribution to the cause of world peace.

In the fraternal neighboring country and close ally, China, the modernization of socialism is advancing victoriously, and the strength and international influence of the People's Republic of China are continuously increasing. Our party and people are as pleased as if it were our own affair and sincerely wish the Chinese people greater achievements in their struggle to implement the resolutions of the 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

Today, our people are closely united around the Workers' Party of Korea, holding high the banner of the three revolutions of ideology, technology, and culture, and have established glorious labor achievements in socialist construction. They are also waging a powerful struggle to achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the fatherland.

To resolve the issue of national reunification through dialogue and consultation is the unanimous demand of all the Korean people today, and it is also completely in line with the trend of the times.

Starting from the desire to unite the strength and wisdom of the entire nation to independently and peacefully resolve the issue of national reunification, we have proposed holding a political consultation meeting between the leaders of the North and the South this year and have made active efforts to realize dialogue in various aspects between the North and the South.

Now, the desire of the South Korean people to unify the fatherland is unprecedentedly high, and the call for extensive contact and dialogue with us is very strong. This time, Reverend Mun Ik-hwan, a democrat from South Korea, came to Pyongyang to meet with us, which is a just patriotic action. It reflects the desire of the South Korean people to open a path to unify the fatherland with their own national strength without external interference.

In fact, the issue of realizing contact and exchanges between the North and the South is in line with the three principles of independence, peaceful reunification, and great national unity, which the North and the South have already agreed upon, and is also an issue advocated by the South Korean authorities. The South Korean authorities have said they will come to Pyongyang to meet with us, and we have also invited South Korean leaders, including the authorities. This time, Reverend Mun Ik-hwan came to Pyongyang at our invitation, which is a very legitimate and natural matter. Only through frequent exchanges and contact between the North and the South can the relationship between the North and the South be improved, and a path to the peaceful reunification of the fatherland be opened; the issue of restoring national commonality and achieving national reconciliation, as advocated by the South Korean authorities, can also be resolved only through contact and exchanges. Therefore, we hope that those who have taken just actions to open a path for exchanges between the North and the South out of a sincere desire to unify the fatherland will not be regarded as lawbreakers and create complex situations. We also hope that President Roh Tae-woo and democratic figures from various sectors in South Korea will accept our invitation and meet with us as soon as possible. In short, to create an atmosphere of national reconciliation and unity, to promote dialogue smoothly, to ease the tension between the North and the South, and to achieve the reunification of the fatherland as soon as possible, we must open up a broad future for our nation.

In easing the tension on the Korean Peninsula, ensuring peace, and changing the situation in the Asia-Pacific region, promoting the process of easing international tensions, this has important significance. In ensuring the peace of Korea and solving the Korean issue, the responsibility and role of the United States are significant. If the United States truly wishes for détente and peace, it should not just talk about it but take practical measures to ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula and ensure lasting peace. It should abandon the "two Koreas" policy and not do anything to obstruct the reunification of Korea.

The two countries of Korea and China are closely related, and the revolutionary cause of the two peoples is linked together. The Communist Party of China, the government, and the people have always actively supported and assisted the just cause of our people in building socialism and reunifying the fatherland. We express our gratitude for this.

The friendship between Korea and China is an unbreakable friendship that has withstood the tests of history. This friendship has been further strengthened and developed through the frequent exchanges and close cooperation between the leaders of the two parties and countries. This visit by Comrade Zhao Ziyang to our country will be another important opportunity to develop the fraternal friendly cooperative relationship between our two parties, two countries, and two peoples to a higher stage.

Our party and people will, as always, advance side by side with the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people in the common struggle against imperialism and for the victory of peace and socialism, and will do our utmost to further strengthen and develop the friendship between Korea and China from generation to generation.

I hope that Comrade Zhao Ziyang's visit to our country will be successful and bear rich fruits.

　　金日成在欢迎赵紫阳的宴会上发表讲话   
    朝鲜竭尽全力发展朝中友谊
    本报平壤４月２４日电  朝鲜劳动党中央总书记金日成今天在欢迎中共中央总书记赵紫阳的宴会上发表讲话。详细摘要如下：
    今天，我们能够再次同我们亲密的朋友和战友中国共产党中央委员会总书记赵紫阳同志在平壤会晤，有意义地欢聚一堂，感到十分高兴。
    尊敬的赵紫阳同志在担负中华人民共和国国务院总理之重任时作为首次出国访问曾前来访问过我国，今天身负中国共产党中央委员会总书记的重任后又首次出国访问来到了我国，这表达了赵紫阳同志和中国共产党要始终不渝地珍视在长期的共同斗争中用鲜血凝成、深深扎根于两国人民心田里的朝中友谊，继续坚守我们之间的革命情义的坚定意志；也清楚地显示了把我们两党、两国人民联结在一起的兄弟友好关系和战斗的友谊。
    在这个洋溢着激动人心的兄弟会晤的喜悦和战友之间同志友爱情谊的宴会上，我以朝鲜劳动党中央委员会和朝鲜人民以及我个人的名义，再一次向我国人民的贵宾赵紫阳同志和他的一行表示热烈的欢迎。
    赵紫阳同志这次对我国的访问，是在朝中两国建交４０周年和中华人民共和国成立４０周年的意义深远的一年进行的。
    ４０年来，朝中两国人民在为自主、独立和社会主义而进行的豪迈斗争中一向相依为命，团结起来同甘共苦，克服了困难，经受了考验，并肩走过了胜利的道路。
    在我国人民艰苦的祖国解放战争时期，兄弟的中国人民在“抗美援朝、保家卫国”的口号下派来以自己的优秀儿女组成的志愿军，用鲜血援助了我们的斗争，因而，早在严峻的抗日革命斗争烈火中扎下了根的朝中友谊已发展成无与伦比的崇高的战斗的骨肉关系，并且随着历史的洪流不断地加强和发展成为任何力量都破坏不了的牢不可破的友谊。今天，传统的朝中友谊按照两国人民共同的志向和愿望，日益巩固和发展，我们为此而感到满意。
    今天，中国人民在长期斗争中得到锻炼、积累了丰富经验的中国共产党久经考验的领导下，在坚持四项基本原则，深化改革和开放，建设具有中国特色的社会主义的斗争中，取得了巨大的成就。中国共产党和中国政府根据独立自主、和平的对外政策，为发展世界各国人民之间的友好关系，建立公正的国际秩序而积极斗争，从而在国际舞台上享有很高的威望，对保卫世界和平的事业作出了巨大贡献。
    在兄弟邻邦、亲密战友的国家——中国，社会主义现代化建设正在胜利进展，中华人民共和国的力量和国际影响在不断增大，对此，我们党和我国人民像对待自己的事情一样感到高兴，并衷心祝愿中国人民在贯彻中国共产党十三大决议的斗争中取得更大的成就。
    今天，我国人民紧密地团结在朝鲜劳动党的周围，高举思想、技术、文化三大革命的旗帜，在社会主义建设中建立了辉煌的劳动功勋，为实现祖国的自主和平统一而进行着有力的斗争。
    通过对话和协商和平解决祖国统一问题，这是今天全体朝鲜人民一致的要求，也是同现时代的趋势完全相符合的。
    从联合全民族的力量和智慧，自主地和平地解决祖国统一问题的愿望出发，我们提出了今年举行北南领导人士政治协商会议的建议，并为实现北南之间多方面的对话作出了积极的努力。
    现在，南朝鲜人民对统一祖国的热望空前高涨，要求同我们广泛进行接触和对话的呼声非常高昂。这次，南朝鲜的有良心的民主人士文益焕牧师前来平壤同我们会晤，这是正义的爱国行动，它反映了南朝鲜人民希望在没有外部势力干涉的情况下，用我们民族自己的力量为统一祖国开辟道路的志向。
    本来，实现北南之间的接触和相互来往的问题，是同北南双方早已达成协议的自主、和平统一、民族大团结这三项原则相符合的，是南朝鲜当权者们也主张的问题。南朝鲜当权者曾说要前来平壤同我们会晤，我们也曾邀请过包括当权者在内的南朝鲜领导人士。这次，文益焕牧师应我们的邀请来过平壤，是极为正当而自然的事情。只有北南之间经常来往和接触，才能改善北南关系，为和平统一祖国开辟道路；南朝鲜当权者们所说的，恢复民族的共同性，实现民族和好的问题，也只有通过接触和来往才能得到解决。因此，我们希望不要把从一心要统一祖国的愿望出发，为开辟北南来往的道路采取了正义行动的人看作违法者而制造复杂的事态，希望卢泰愚总统和南朝鲜的各界民主人士也应我们的邀请早日和我们会晤。总之，要造成民族和解和团结的氛围，顺利发展对话，以便缓和北方和南方之间的紧张状态，早日实现祖国的统一，开拓我们民族的广阔前程。
    在朝鲜半岛缓和紧张局势，保障和平，这对改变亚太地区的形势，促进整个国际紧张局势的缓和过程，具有重要的意义。在保障朝鲜的和平，解决朝鲜问题方面，美国的责任和作用是重大的。如果美国真心希望局势和缓与和平，就不要只在口头上说，而要采取在朝鲜半岛缓和紧张局势、保障持久和平的实际措施，要抛弃“两个朝鲜”政策，不要干出阻挠朝鲜统一的事情。
    朝中两国唇齿相依，两国人民的革命事业是联结在一起的。中国共产党、政府和人民一向积极支持和声援我国人民建设社会主义、统一祖国的正义事业。对此，我们表示感谢。
    朝中友谊是经受住了历史的种种考验的牢不可破的友谊，这一友谊通过两党两国领导人频繁来往密切合作的过程，进一步得到加强和发展。这次赵紫阳同志对我国的访问，在使我们两党、两国、两国人民的兄弟友好合作关系发展到更高阶段方面，将成为又一个重要契机。
    我们党和我国人民将一如既往，在反对帝国主义、争取和平与社会主义事业胜利的共同斗争中，同中国共产党和中国人民并肩前进，为了一代接一代进一步加强和发展朝中友谊而竭尽一切努力。
    我希望赵紫阳同志对我国的访问取得成功，结出丰硕果实。
