Beijing Prosecutorial Organs Clearly Propose That Anti-Corruption and Bribery in Government Agencies is the Key Focus

		People's Daily, Beijing, April 14—Reporters Yan Shigui and Law Daily reporter Yu Nengxiang report: To curb the exchange of power for money and to stop the spread of corruption, Beijing's prosecutorial organs have listed the fight against corruption and bribery as their top priority, with a focus on various levels of party and government agencies.

		According to information provided at the ongoing municipal prosecutorial system's anti-corruption and bribery work conference, in 1988 compared to 1987, the number of embezzlement cases in the city increased by 7.4%, and bribery cases increased by 13.5%. Among these, major cases increased by over 30%. Due to the increased anti-investigation awareness of criminals, their cunning and deceptive methods, as well as the dense layers of protection and networks of relationships, investigations and prosecutions face a series of difficulties including difficulty in discovery, arrest, evidence collection, asset recovery, case determination, and handling.

		In response to this situation, the Municipal Prosecutor's Office has made a decision: to strengthen specialized institutions, improve work systems, train a group of experts, and deepen the fight against corruption and bribery. For public reports, timely investigation and feedback are required, and a comprehensive reporting system including rewards should be established. Leaders should personally participate in case handling. Reports to the Municipal Prosecutor's Office leadership meeting and the Prosecutorial Committee should be made personally by the supervising prosecutor or the head prosecutor. For outstanding performance in case handling, rewards for meritorious service or promotions should be given.

　　北京市检察机关明确提出
　　反贪污受贿
　　机关是重点
    本报北京４月１４日讯　本报记者颜世贵、法制日报记者虞能祥报道：遏制权力同金钱的交易，制止腐败现象蔓延，北京市检察机关把反贪污反受贿斗争列为第一位工作，并把工作的重点放在各级党政机关。
    据正在举行的市检察系统反贪污反受贿工作座谈会提供的情况，１９８８年同１９８７年相比，全市贪污案上升７．４％，受贿案上升１３．５％，其中大案分别上升３０％以上。由于犯罪分子反侦查意识增长，犯罪手段诡秘狡猾，加之保护层、关系网密密麻麻，给侦查办案带来发现难、破获难、取证难、追赃难、定案难、处理难等成串困难。
    针对这种情况，市检察院作出决定：强化专门机构，完善工作制度，培训一批专家，把反贪污受贿斗争引向深入。对群众的举报，要及时查处和反馈，健全包括奖励在内的举报工作制度，领导干部要直接参加办案。向市院检察长办公会和检察委员会汇报案件，一律由主管检察长、外长亲自汇报案情。对办案作出突出成绩的，给予立功或晋级奖励。
