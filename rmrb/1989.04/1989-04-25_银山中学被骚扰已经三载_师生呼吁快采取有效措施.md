Appeal

Since April 1986, some young people have frequently gone to Yinshan Farm Middle School in our county to cause trouble. During classes, they ride bicycles in the corridors outside the classrooms, constantly ringing the bells, whistling, mimicking the teachers' lectures, or fighting with each other. During evening self-study sessions, they barge into the classrooms, talking and laughing loudly, and even rummaging through female students' drawers and forcibly taking their books. They also enter the male students' dormitories without permission, demanding money, military uniforms, belts, and other items from the students, and beating them if they refuse. On one day in September last year, four young men suddenly burst into the dormitory of the third-year students and demanded money from Li Wenlong without reason. When Li Wenlong refused, the group beat him up and then left.

The young people who cause trouble at Yinshan Farm Middle School not only beat students but also assault teachers. On the evening of March 7 this year, eight young men from the 308 branch of the Jiangxi Nonferrous Smelting and Processing Plant sneaked into the school and made a ruckus at the classroom door, disrupting the students' evening self-study. Teacher Cao Huaxing tried to persuade them to leave, but they not only ignored his advice but also twisted his hands behind his back. The deputy principal, Shen Baiyou, stepped forward to persuade them, but was surrounded by six young men who kicked and punched him, knocking him to the ground. Currently, Shen Baiyou is still in the hospital receiving treatment.

The school leadership has repeatedly reported these young people's misconduct to their respective units, but no effective measures have been taken to stop them.

　　银山中学被骚扰已经三载  师生呼吁快采取有效措施
    １９８６年４月以来，一些青年经常到我县银山垦殖场中学寻衅滋事。上课时，他们在教室外的走廊里骑自行车，不断按车铃，吹口哨，学老师讲话，或互相打闹。晚自习时，他们闯进教室，大声说笑，甚至乱翻女生抽屉，强行拿走女生书本。他们还擅自进入男生宿舍，向学生索要现金、军装、皮带等物，不给就打人。去年９月的一天中午，４名青年突然闯入初三学生的寝室，无故向学生李文龙要钱。李文龙不给，这伙人就拳脚相加，把李文龙痛打一顿，然后扬长而去。
    到银山垦殖场中学闹事的这些青年，不但打学生，还殴打教师。今年３月７日晚上，江西有色冶炼加工厂三○八分厂的８名青年窜进学校，在教室门口喧哗打闹，干扰学生晚自习。教师曹华青劝他们离开，他们不但不听劝，反而把曹老师的双手剪向后背使劲地扭。教导主任沈百友上前好言劝阻，也被６名青年团团围住，你一脚，他一拳，把沈老师打倒在地。目前，沈百友还在住院治疗。
    学校领导人曾多次到这些寻衅滋事青年所在单位反映他们的恶劣行径，但一直得不到有效的制止。
