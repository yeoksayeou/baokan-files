An alarming trend is threatening Jiangsu Province's future: the province's population is increasing by the equivalent of one county each year, while its arable land is decreasing by the same amount.

Statistics recently provided by the Jiangsu Provincial Bureau of Statistics show that from 1957 to 1987, Jiangsu, a province with a large population and limited land, lost an average of over 600,000 mu of arable land each year. In 1988, it lost nearly 340,000 mu of arable land, exceeding the total arable land in Jiangpu County near Nanjing. At the same time, the population increased by 900,000, equivalent to the population of a medium-sized county.

According to predictions by the Jiangsu Provincial Population Census Office, by the year 2000, Jiangsu's population will reach 72.55 million, an increase of 8.17 million from 1988. To maintain the current level of 500 kg of grain per person by then, an additional 40 billion kg of grain will be needed, which requires an additional 5.3 million mu of arable land. However, arable land is decreasing year by year. If this trend continues, by the end of the century, the per capita arable land will decrease from the current 1.06 mu to around 0.8 mu.

However, the issue of decreasing arable land has not yet received enough attention, and incidents of illegal occupation and misuse of arable land still occur from time to time. Last year alone, various levels of land management departments in Jiangsu Province collected 14,000 cases of illegal land occupation.

### 江苏耕地连年锐减　一年所减相当于一个县

　　江苏耕地连年锐减
　　一年所减相当于一个县
    据新华社南京４月１５日电　（记者孙参）一种令人担忧的现象威胁着江苏省的未来：这个省的人口正以每年一个县的规模猛增，而耕地却以每年一个县的规模锐减。
    江苏省统计局新近提供的数字表明：人多地少的江苏省从１９５７年到１９８７年，耕地平均每年减少６０多万亩，１９８８年又减少耕地近３４万亩，超过了南京附近江浦县的全部耕地面积；同时净增人口９０万，相当于多出一个中等县的人口。
    据江苏省人口普查办公室预测，到２０００年，江苏人口将达到７２５５万，比１９８８年净增８１７万。若想到那时继续保持人均占有粮食５００公斤的水平，需要增加４０多亿公斤粮食，这就需增加耕地５３０多万亩，但现在耕地却年年减少，如此下去，到本世纪末人均占有耕地将从目前１．０６亩下降为０．８亩左右。
    但是，耕地减少现象至今还未引起人们足够的重视，滥占乱用耕地事件还时有发生。去年江苏省各级土地管理部门收集到的违章占地案件就有１．４万起之多。
