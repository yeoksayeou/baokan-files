Books and magazines with low taste standards have flooded domestic bookstalls, corrupting people's minds. Relevant authorities are taking measures to rectify the chaotic situation in the book market.

On April 19, the News and Publishing Administration learned that the China Braille Press and the magazine "Television Literature" have been penalized for seriously violating publishing management regulations.

In October last year, the China Braille Press violated co-publishing regulations, selling 13 book numbers and relinquishing management rights, leading to unauthorized publishing by intermediaries. The Shenzhen Lǐ Sāo Book Society used the purchased book numbers to publish the "Mountain and Sea Series," including "Thousand Postures," which used books as periodicals and featured erotic images on the covers and inserts. Most of the collected works described debauchery and murder. This press did not follow orders and, without approval, published new martial arts novels.

The News and Publishing Administration decided on the same day: to suspend the Chinese character book publishing business of the China Braille Press; to stop the circulation of all editions of the "Mountain and Sea Series," and to destroy the printing plates and remaining books; to confiscate all income obtained by the press, co-publishing units, and intermediaries from publishing these books, and to hand it over to the local finance department. The economic losses caused by the seizure and destruction will be jointly borne by the press, co-publishing units, or individuals.

The magazine "Television Literature" last year, citing the large quantity of television scripts, applied for an additional issue number, sold it to a bookseller, and published "The Fifth Crime," with erotic content in the illustrations. The Hebei Provincial News and Publishing Bureau decided to revoke the registration and cancel the publication number of the magazine, confiscating its illegal earnings; to confiscate the earnings and impose fines on the bookseller who bought the number, and to revoke their business license; to issue a circular criticizing the printing factory; and to criticize and educate the illustrator.

　　违反出版管理规定受制裁    
    中国盲文出版社停业整顿《电视文学》杂志被吊销刊号
    新华社北京电（记者李光茹）格调低下的书刊充斥着国内大小书摊，腐蚀着人们的心灵。有关方面正在采取措施，以改变图书市场的混乱状况。
    记者４月１９日从新闻出版署了解到，中国盲文出版社和《电视文学》杂志因严重违反出版管理规定受到制裁。
    去年１０月，中国盲文出版社违反协作出版规定，先后卖出１３个书号，放弃管理权，造成中间人擅自出书情况。深圳离骚书社用买的书号出版的“山南海北丛书”，包括《千姿百态》等，以书代刊，且封面、插图带有色情形象，所收作品大部分是描写淫乱、凶杀等内容。这家出版社有令不行，未经报批还擅自出版了新武侠小说。
    新闻出版署同日作出决定：对中国盲文出版社汉文图书的出版业务进行停业整顿；“山南海北丛书”的所有品种停止发行，纸型和存书销毁；出版社、协作单位及中间人因出版这些书所得的收入全部没收，上交地方财政。因查缴销毁造成的经济损失由出版社、协作单位或个人共同承担。
    《电视文学》杂志去年以电视剧本量大为由，要到一个增刊号，卖给书商，出版了《第五种犯罪》，文章中的插图带有色情内容。河北省新闻出版局已决定对该杂志作撤销登记，吊销刊号，没收其非法所得的处理；对买号书商没收所得、罚款，并没收其营业执照；对印刷厂给予通报批评；对插图作者给予批评教育。
