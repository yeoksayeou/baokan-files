Recently, the State Council issued a notice requiring various regions to further improve the work of collecting agricultural and forestry specialty taxes. Xinhua News Agency reporters interviewed a responsible person from the Agricultural Tax Collection Management Bureau of the Ministry of Finance regarding this matter.

Q: What is the current situation regarding the collection of agricultural and forestry specialty taxes?

A: Since the State Council issued the "Provisions on the Collection of Agricultural Taxes on Agricultural and Forestry Specialty Income" in 1983, the collection of agricultural and forestry specialty taxes has made some progress. However, the collection work across the country is very uneven. Some provinces and cities still do not levy taxes on agricultural and forestry specialty income. Many tax-collecting regions have not organized the collection of all taxable product incomes, resulting in significant tax losses. This situation no longer suits the changing economic landscape. Over the past decade, the production of agricultural and forestry specialty products has developed rapidly, and the sales prices of these products have increased significantly. Generally, the income from engaging in the production of agricultural and forestry specialty products is higher than that from growing grains. However, the tax burden on agricultural and forestry specialty products has been very light in the past, and in some places, the tax burden on agricultural and forestry specialty products is even lighter than that on grain fields. This has affected the enthusiasm of some farmers to grow grains, and the conflict between agricultural and forestry specialty products and grains over land is becoming increasingly prominent. Therefore, it is necessary to fully levy taxes on agricultural and forestry specialty incomes and make some improvements to the tax collection methods.

Q: What is the main purpose of further improving the collection of agricultural and forestry specialty taxes?

A: The main purpose of fully collecting agricultural and forestry specialty taxes is to adjust the income levels of agricultural and forestry specialty products and other agricultural products, and to promote the sustained and stable development of agriculture, especially grain production. Currently, the internal price ratios of agricultural products are not reasonable, with grain prices being relatively low. However, significantly increasing grain prices in the short term is restricted by fiscal and social affordability. To stabilize grain production, in addition to using price measures, other regulatory measures are also needed. Fully collecting agricultural and forestry specialty taxes is to use the tax lever to appropriately adjust the income of agricultural and forestry specialty products with higher incomes, which is beneficial for the adjustment of agricultural structure.

Q: Why is it necessary to levy agricultural and forestry specialty taxes on fruit vegetables and marine aquaculture incomes?

A: In recent years, the production of fruit vegetables and marine aquaculture has seen significant development. From 1983 to 1987, the planting area of fruit vegetables increased by 1.3 times, and the output of marine aquaculture products increased by 1.02 times. Considering that the income from the production of fruit vegetables and marine aquaculture is relatively high, and the conflict between fruit vegetable production and grain fields is quite prominent, it is necessary to include these two categories of product incomes within the scope of taxation.

Q: Why is it necessary to implement a uniform national tax rate for the incomes of four major categories of products: fruits, aquatic products, fruit vegetables, and logs?

A: The original regulation stipulated that the tax rate for agricultural and forestry specialty taxes is 5% to 10%, with a maximum of not exceeding 15%. The tax rates were determined by the provincial, autonomous region, and municipal governments, but the actual tax rates determined by various regions were relatively low. To facilitate the balance of tax burdens and the adjustment of production, this time, a uniform national tax rate of 10% or 15% is stipulated for aquatic farming, fruits, and fruit vegetables with relatively high incomes. Logs are major products, and there are significant differences in the tax rates implemented by various regions. To protect forest resources, a uniform tax rate is also stipulated for logs. The above four categories of products account for approximately 80% of the value of taxable products. Implementing a uniform national tax rate for these products is beneficial for controlling major tax sources.

Q: Why should the management of agricultural and forestry specialty tax collection be in accordance with the "Provisional Regulations on the Administration of Tax Collection and Administration of the People's Republic of China"?

A: The tax sources for agricultural and forestry specialty taxes are scattered, and currently, there are relatively common phenomena of tax evasion, tax avoidance, and tax resistance. In the past, there were no clear provisions for handling violations of agricultural and forestry specialty taxes, and tax collection personnel felt that there were no laws to rely on. To ensure the normal operation of tax collection work and the timely remittance of tax revenues, this time it is clearly stipulated that the collection of agricultural and forestry specialty taxes should be in accordance with the "Provisional Regulations on the Administration of Tax Collection and Administration of the People's Republic of China."

Q: What work needs to be done to fully collect agricultural and forestry specialty taxes?

A: First, it is necessary to strengthen propaganda and education to improve people's understanding of the collection of agricultural and forestry specialty taxes. Second, the tax collection agencies should, under the unified leadership of the government at all levels, cooperate with relevant departments to implement various measures and tax collection tasks. Third, it is necessary to improve the tax collection and management system, establish a tax declaration system, and control tax sources.

　　财政部有关负责人答记者问
　　农林特产税如何全面征收
    新华社北京４月１０日电　最近国务院发出通知，要求各地进一步做好征收农林特产农业税工作。新华社记者就此问题采访了财政部农业税征收管理局负责人。
    问：当前农林特产农业税（以下简称农林特产税）的征收状况如何？
    答：１９８３年国务院发布《关于对农林特产收入征收农业税的若干规定》后，农林特产税征收工作取得了一定的进展。但是，全国征收工作开展得很不平衡，少数省市至今对农林特产收入还没有征税；许多征税地区也没有对应税产品收入全面组织征收，税款流失较多。这种状况已不适应变化了的经济形势。１０年来农林特产品生产发展较快，产品销售价格大幅度提高。从事农林特产品生产的收入一般要高于种粮收入。但是以往农林特产品税负很轻，有的地方农林特产品税负甚至比粮田的税负还要轻，这就影响了部分地区农民种粮的积极性，农林特产和粮食争地的矛盾日渐突出。因此，有必要对农林特产收入全面征税，并对征税办法作若干改进。
    问：进一步做好农林特产税征收工作的主要目的是什么？
    答：全面征收农林特产税的主要目的是调节农林特产和其他农产品的收入水平，促进农业特别是粮食生产持续稳定发展。目前，农产品内部比价不够合理，粮价偏低，但是近期内大幅度提高粮价又受到财政和社会承受能力的限制。为稳定粮食生产，除运用价格手段外，还需要采取其他调控措施。全面征收农林特产税，就是通过税收杠杆，对收入较高的农林特产进行适当调节，以利于农业结构的调整。
    问：为什么要对果用瓜和海水养殖收入征收农林特产税？
    答：近几年，果用瓜和海水养殖生产有较大发展。１９８３年到１９８７年果用瓜种植面积扩大１．３倍，海水养殖产品产量增长１．０２倍。考虑到果用瓜，海水养殖生产收入较高，果用瓜生产与粮田争地矛盾比较突出，因此，有必要将这两类产品收入纳入征税范围。
    问：为什么要对水果、水产、果用瓜、原木４类大宗产品收入实行全国统一税率？
    答：原规定农林特产税税率为５％—１０％，最高不超过１５％，分品目税率由各省、自治区、直辖市人民政府自行确定，而各地实际确定的税率偏低。从有利于平衡税负和调节生产出发，这次对收入较高的水产养殖、水果、果用瓜３类产品分别规定１０％或１５％的全国统一税率。原木是大宗产品，各地执行税率差异悬殊，为保护林木资源，这次也规定了统一税率。上述４类产品产值约占应税产品产值的８０％左右，对其实行全国统一税率有利于控制大宗税源。
    问：农林特产税征收管理为何要执行《中华人民共和国税收征收管理暂行条例》？
    答：农林特产税税源分散，目前漏税、偷税现象较为普遍，抗税情况也时有发生。过去农林特产税没有明确的违章处理规定，征管人员感到无法可依。为保证征收工作正常开展和应征税款及时入库，这次明确规定农林特产税的征收，按照《中华人民共和国税收征收管理暂行条例》执行。
    问：全面征收农林特产税，要做好哪些工作？
    答：首先，要加强宣传教育，提高人们对征收农林特产税的认识。其次，财政征收机关要在各级政府统一领导下，与有关部门相互配合，落实各项措施和征收任务。第三，要完善征管制度，建立纳税申报制度，控制税源。
