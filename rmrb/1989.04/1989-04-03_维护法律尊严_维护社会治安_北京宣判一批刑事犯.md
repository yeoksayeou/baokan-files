Upholding Legal Dignity and Maintaining Social Order
Beijing Sentences a Batch of Criminals

	Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court publicly sentenced two criminal cases on March 27, with three criminals sentenced to death and deprivation of political rights for life. At the same time, a number of criminals who seriously disturbed social order and posed significant threats received severe punishments.

	The criminal sentenced to death, Gou Jiuyuan, had on May 19 last year, at a restaurant in Beijing, without any provocation, verbally abused three university students. Despite the students' repeated attempts to avoid the confrontation, they could not escape. Gou Jiuyuan, unwilling to let go, then directed three accomplices to chase and stab the students with knives. One of the students was stabbed in the head, shoulder, and chest. Although the student was promptly rescued by the hospital, he was left with lifelong disabilities.

	The other two sentenced to death, Zhou Jiangang and Qin Jianhui, were both released criminals. They had committed over 150 crimes in Beijing, Xinjiang, and other places, stealing money and goods worth over 170,000 yuan.

　　维护法律尊严　维护社会治安
    北京宣判一批刑事犯
    本报讯  记者毛磊报道：北京市中级人民法院３月２７日公开宣判两起刑事案件，三名罪犯被判处死刑，剥夺政治权利终身。与此同时，一批对社会骚扰面大、危害特别严重的犯罪分子受到严惩。
    被判处死刑的罪犯苟桂员，曾于去年５月１９日晚，在北京一饭馆对三名大学生无端寻衅辱骂。三位大学生一再忍让，仍不得摆脱，便避离饭馆。苟桂员不肯罢休，又指挥三名同伙分别持刀追砍三大学生。其中一名大学生被刺伤头部、肩部、胸部，虽经医院及时抢救脱险，但已落下终身残疾。
    处以死刑的另外两人邹建钢、秦建辉均为刑满释放人员。他们曾在北京、新疆等地作案１５０余起，盗窃钱物达１７万余元。
