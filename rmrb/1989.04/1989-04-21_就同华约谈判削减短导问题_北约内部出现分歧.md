The nuclear planning group of NATO defense ministers, which convened on the morning of the 19th, concluded its meeting at noon on the 20th. The communiqué issued by the meeting made no mention of the Warsaw Pact's proposal on the 12th to quickly engage in negotiations with NATO on the reduction of short-range nuclear weapons in Europe.

Sources in the local press revealed that, with the exception of Belgium, the West German government was also prepared to actively respond to the Warsaw Pact's proposal and engage in negotiations to reduce short-range missiles in Europe. There were also signs that the British were softening their stance.

However, NATO Secretary-General Werner and U.S. Secretary of Defense Cheney, at a press conference held after the meeting, still expressed their refusal to hold talks with the Warsaw Pact. This reflects the fact that, on this issue, NATO is currently not unified and is still in the stage of consultation and debate.

　　就同华约谈判削减短导问题    
    北约内部出现分歧
    本报布鲁塞尔４月２０日电  记者魏崴报道：１９日上午举行的北约国防部长核计划小组会议２０日中午结束，会议发表的公报对华约１２日建议同北约尽快就欧洲短程核武器谈判，只字未提。
    此间报界透露，在昨天会议上，除比利时外，西德政府亦准备积极响应华约建议，谈判削减欧洲短导，英国人的态度亦出现软化的征兆。
    然而，北约秘书长韦尔纳和美国国防部长切尼，在会议后举行的记者招待会上仍表示拒绝与华约会谈。这反映出在这个问题上，北约内部目前尚未统一，仍处在磋商和辩论阶段。
