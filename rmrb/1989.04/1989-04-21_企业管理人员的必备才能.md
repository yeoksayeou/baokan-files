The essential qualities of enterprise managers

On March 28, the French newspaper "Le Figaro" published an article titled "We Must Win the Economic War" by Bernard Esambert, the chairman of the Paris Institute of Technology. The article discusses the relationship between modern enterprise competition and the quality of managers, and emphasizes the importance of cultivating young people and prioritizing talent investment. The following is an excerpt:

The world economic war can be summarized as a struggle for markets and technology. It has replaced the past wars for territory and colonies. Therefore, it can be said that everyone is now living in the midst of a world economic war. This conflict is real, and its goal is to conquer the opponent, create jobs, and increase income. This phenomenon has become more intense after the economic miracle and crises of the 1960s.

Under these conditions, enterprise managers have become the officers of the economic war. They must make their enterprises innovative, productive, and able to sell products in foreign markets, all at the lowest possible cost.

Therefore, enterprise managers must possess the following qualities: professional expertise, capability, imagination, creativity (not adhering to old ways), a global outlook, a sense of responsibility, adaptability to various cultural backgrounds, understanding of the social environment, humility, a willingness to listen to others, and a belief in winning in international competition.

Professionalism and capability: Young people must cultivate a habit of lifelong learning. In this regard, Japan and West Germany have set good examples, achieving success in the economic war. To make an enterprise enter the ranks of advanced enterprises, managers must expand their professional knowledge and master related fields.

Imagination: International competition makes the environment constantly changing. How can one's mental state adapt to this change? One possible approach is to leverage the strengths of young people, imparting new knowledge to them and cultivating their keen observational skills.

Innovative spirit: This is essential for the new corporate culture. It is important to combine the training of senior personnel with the summarization of work experience. Leaders should cherish trained college graduates, even if they deviate from the research direction, and should care for them.

Global outlook: Every educational system can attract a large number of foreign students. In the long run, introducing talent is the best investment. Universities and enterprises should both be "transnational," not only having foreign teachers and researchers but also establishing their enterprises abroad.

Sense of responsibility: The sense of responsibility of enterprise managers, their heavy tasks, must be commensurate with their improved social status and must be maintained at all times. Degrees can only judge past academic records and cannot indicate current levels.

Moral and ethical standards: Liberalism requires strict adherence to competition rules and a consistent sense of duty.

Continuity of training: Due to the mobility and changes of personnel, there is an even greater need for rapid and continuous training of professional personnel. Clearly, this change is beneficial to the enterprise, providing it with a wide range of topics. At the same time, competition remains a powerful force driving the enterprise in a positive direction.

### 企业管理人员的必备才能

专栏：外论摘要

　　企业管理人员的必备才能
    法国《费加罗报》三月二十八日刊登了巴黎综合工科学校董事长贝尔纳德·埃桑贝尔写的题为《我们必须赢得经济战争》一文，论述了现代化企业竞争和管理人员素质的关系，并指出关心青年人的培养与优先做好人才投资的重要意义。现摘译如下：
    世界经济战争可以概括为：争夺市场和工艺。它取代了过去对领土和殖民地的战争。因此人们可以说，今天大家都生存在世界经济战争之中。这种冲突是实实在在的，它的目标就是要征服对方，为自己创造就业和增加收入。这种现象，在经历了六十年代的“经济奇迹”和危机之后，变得激烈起来了。
    在这种条件下，企业管理人员成了经济战争的军官。他们必须使自己的企业变成革新的、产销两旺的、产品能打到国外市场的企业，而且所有这一切都要以最低的代价来实现。
    于是，要求企业管理人员必须具备以下的条件，即熟悉专业、有能力、有想象力、创造力（不是因循守旧），敢于面向世界，具有责任感，并能适应各种背景的文化，了解社会环境，谦虚谨慎，善于听取别人的意见，以及在国际竞争中怀有必胜的信念。
    专业化和能力　青年人务必养成好学的习惯。在这方面，日本和联邦德国已做出榜样，他们在经济战争中干得漂亮，要使企业进入先进的行列，企业管理人员就必须扩大专业知识，并精通相关的各种专业。
    想象力　国际竞争使得环境不断变化，人的精神状态怎样适应这一变化呢？可能的办法是，发挥年轻人的特点，尽可能向他们传授新的知识，培养他们敏锐的观察能力。
    革新精神　这是企业新文化所必须的。要善于把高级人员的培训和总结工作的经验结合起来。领导人要爱惜受过训练的大学生，即使他们在研究中偏离了方向，也应关心他们。
    面向世界　每种教育制度都能吸引大批的外国学生。从长远看，引进人才，这是一种最好的投资，大学和企业一样，都应该是“跨国的”，不仅应该有外国的教师、研究员，也应该使自己的企业扎根在国外。
    责任意识　企业管理人员的责任感、他们承担繁重的任务，都必须与他们提高了的社会地位相适应，并使这种状况常备不懈。文凭只能判断过去的学历，而不能说明现在的水平。
    道德、伦理的准则　自由主义要求人们严格遵守竞争的准则，和一种始终如一的道义。
    培训的连续性　由于人员的流动和变化，更要求对专业人员的培训迅速不断。很明显，这种变化对企业有好处，它为企业提供了广泛的课题。同时，竞争仍是促进企业朝着好的方向发展的强劲的动力。
