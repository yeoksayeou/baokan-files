Since March, public security organs at all levels in Henan Province have collaborated with the procuratorate, courts, and judicial departments to launch a large-scale campaign to crack down on robbery, theft, and hooliganism in both urban and rural areas across the province. On April 5, the first coordinated strike was implemented across the province. The public has responded positively, noting that this crackdown has been precise and effective, curbing the arrogance of criminals and restoring a sense of security among the people.

It is reported that during this crackdown, public security organs at all levels in Henan Province have arrested 22,478 criminal suspects, capturing a large number of criminals; solved over 16,800 criminal cases, including more than 2,300 major cases; dismantled over 2,600 criminal gangs, arresting more than 11,400 gang members; and boosted the confidence and courage of the masses to fight against various illegal and criminal activities. The public has actively participated in this crackdown, providing the public security organs with over 4,100 criminal leads and voluntarily turning in 1,168 criminals.

Li Guangjing, Director of the Henan Provincial Public Security Bureau, introduced the characteristics of this crackdown to the reporter:

---

The focus of the crackdown is clear, targeting key areas and hitting the core issues. The primary targets are criminals involved in robbery, theft, and hooliganism, especially those operating in gangs. In 1988, Henan Province reported over 40,000 cases of these three types of crimes, accounting for more than 80% of the total cases. This year, the incidence of these crimes has continued to rise. Phrases like "fear of burglars at home and robbers on the road" have resurfaced, and public complaints have been particularly strong.

---

Preparation has been thorough, and cases are handled strictly according to the law. Since March, public security organs at all levels across the province have organized personnel to prepare in five areas: investigating and solving cases, focusing on disorder, patrolling and controlling, and preliminary examination and case closure. They have worked day and night to verify evidence, determine arrest targets, and ensure the quality of case handling. At the same time, they adhere to the principle that arrests should only be made for those who meet the criteria for detention or re-education through labor, and cases should be handled strictly according to the law. No arbitrary arrest quotas are set, and no cases are fabricated without legal procedures.

The Henan Provincial Public Security Bureau, Procuratorate, and Courts have also issued a joint notice to the province, urging criminals to surrender and take advantage of lenient treatment. It is reported that under the pressure of strong propaganda and public opinion, 1,269 criminals have already surrendered to public security organs at various levels.

　　集中打击抢劫、盗窃、流氓滋扰犯罪活动
　　河南公检法司协同作战
　　一大批犯罪分子、团伙落入法网
    本报郑州４月１６日电　记者李杰报道：３月份以来，河南省各级公安机关与检、法、司等部门协同作战，在全省城乡开展了声势浩大的集中打击抢劫、盗窃、流氓滋扰犯罪活动的斗争，并于４月５日，实施了集中打击的第一次全省统一行动。群众反映，这次集中打击，抓的准，打的狠，犯罪分子的嚣张气焰收敛了，人民群众的安全感又开始回来了。
    据了解，在这次集中打击中，河南省各级公安机关共抓捕犯罪分子２２４７８人，一大批犯罪分子落入法网；破获各种刑事案件１６８００多起，其中重大案件２３００多起；摧毁犯罪团伙２６００多个，抓获团伙成员１１４００多人；增强了广大群众同各种违法犯罪行为作斗争的勇气和信心，广大人民群众积极参加这次集中打击的行动，向公安机关提供犯罪线索４１００余条、自觉扭送犯罪分子１１６８人。
    省公安厅长李广经向记者介绍，河南省这次集中打击抢劫、盗窃、流氓滋扰犯罪活动的斗争的特点是：
    ——打击的锋芒集中，突出了重点、击中了要害。重点打击抢劫、盗窃和流氓滋扰这三类犯罪分子，特别是这三种团伙犯罪。１９８８年，河南省发生这三类案件４万起，占全部发案总数的８０％以上，今年以来，这三类案件发案率继续上升。“上班怕撬门，上路怕强盗”的现象重新出现，群众反映也最为强烈。
    ——准备充分、严格依法办案。３月份以来，全省各级公安机关组织人马，从摸底排队、侦察破案、重点治乱、巡逻控制、预审清案等５个方面着手准备，日夜加班，查证落实材料、确定抓捕对象。同时，坚持抓捕的对象应是够逮捕、劳教的，坚持依法办案，不定抓人指标、不凑数、不办法律手续不抓人，保证办案质量。
    河南省公安厅、检察院、法院等部门还向全省发出“联合通告”，敦促犯罪分子尽快投案自首，走从宽处理的道路。据了解，在强大的宣传和社会舆论压力下已有１２６９名犯罪分子向各级公安机关投案自首。
