Li Peng in Tokyo Answers Questions from Chinese and Foreign Journalists
Expounds on Sino-Japanese and Sino-Soviet Relations

BEIJING, April 14 — Li Peng, Premier of the State Council, held a press conference this afternoon in Tokyo, where he answered questions from Chinese and foreign journalists regarding Sino-Japanese relations and international issues.

Regarding Sino-Japanese relations, Li Peng responded to a question from a reporter from this newspaper by saying, "Overall, Sino-Japanese relations are good, but there are often some issues that need attention. I believe that as long as we handle these issues in accordance with the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Peace and Friendship Treaty and the Joint Statement, they can be resolved more appropriately. During my formal talks with Prime Minister Takeshita, we discussed these issues. I believe that Takeshita's impression is that he is willing to adhere to the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Peace and Friendship Treaty and the Joint Statement, which makes us feel gratified."

Li Peng continued, "Yesterday afternoon, my wife and I met with His Majesty the Emperor and Empress of Japan. After the meeting, my wife and I, along with the main members of our delegation, attended a luncheon hosted by the Emperor. The entire meeting and luncheon were conducted in a very warm and friendly atmosphere. The Emperor reviewed the historical relations between China and Japan. He said, 'Over the long course of history, our two countries have had exchanges since ancient times, and the relations were good. However, unfortunate events occurred in modern history, and he expressed regret for this.' I said that we review history to look forward to the future. We both have the desire to make efforts to further develop Sino-Japanese friendship. Li Peng introduced that during the meeting, the Emperor showed great interest in Chinese culture. Therefore, I said, 'China has many places worth visiting. I hope you will come to China to visit when it is convenient for you.' The Emperor expressed his willingness to come, but he said that this matter still needs to be discussed with the Japanese government."

A Japanese journalist asked, "As a Japanese journalist, I would like to ask from the Japanese perspective why in Premier Li's political report to the National People's Congress on international relations, Japan was mentioned last." Premier Li Peng said, "Please do not forget one fact: soon after the closing of the National People's Congress, I came to Japan for a visit, and this is the first visit of the year. I don't think we can say that we do not attach importance to our relations with Japan? To say that we only attach importance to economic relations with Japan and not political relations is also not fair. In the three days I have been in Japan, I have met almost all the political leaders and several former prime ministers. I don't think the journalist can say they are from the economic sector! I hope you can change this impression."

Regarding the Sino-Soviet relations, Premier Li said, "The upcoming high-level meeting in May will mainly discuss the normalization of Sino-Soviet state relations, and of course, the Cambodian issue will also be discussed. The main focus will be on exchanging views on international relations and bilateral relations. After the talks, a written statement will naturally be issued, but the name of the statement is still under discussion between the two sides. The name is not important; the main thing is the content. The content will mainly record the issues on which consensus has been reached or the issues on which no consensus has been reached. I do not think it will be a treaty or a declaration. I believe that this high-level meeting will have a positive impact on further improving Sino-Soviet relations and on peace in the Asia-Pacific region and the world."

During Gorbachev's visit to China, General Secretary Zhao Ziyang will meet with him. Gorbachev is the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and since the two general secretaries have met, it naturally means the restoration of relations between the two parties. The so-called restoration of relations means that in the future, the two parties can have contact, and the leaders and departments of the two parties can have contact. We have such relations with many communist parties, socialist parties, labor parties, and nationalist political parties in the world. But there is no coordination of policies between the two parties.

Foreign Minister Qian Qichen accompanied Premier Li Peng to attend the press conference.

　　李鹏在东京答中外记者问
　　阐述中日中苏关系
    本报东京４月１４日电　记者孙东民、于青报道：李鹏总理在今天下午举行的中外记者招待会上，就中日关系、国际问题回答了记者的提问。
    关于中日关系，李鹏在回答本报记者的提问时说，中日两国关系总的来说是良好的，但是也经常出现一些这样或那样需要注意的问题。我认为只要能够按照我们双方所签订的中日和平友好条约以及联合声明的精神加以处理，自然能够得到更妥善的解决。在这次我和竹下首相的正式会谈中，我们提到了这些问题。我认为竹下给我的印象也是愿意遵守中日和平友好条约和联合声明的精神的，这使我们感到欣慰。
    李鹏接着说，昨天中午我和我夫人与日本天皇陛下和皇后会了面。在会见以后我和我夫人及主要随行人员参加了天皇举行的午宴，整个的会见和午宴都是在非常亲切友好的气氛中进行的。天皇回顾了中日两国的历史关系。他说道，我们在漫长的岁月里两国的关系很早就有交往，关系是好的。但是在近代史上发生了不幸的事件，他对此表示遗憾。我表示我们回顾历史是为了展望将来，我们都有这样的愿望，即为进一步发展中日友谊应该作出努力。李鹏介绍说，在会见中，天皇对中国的文化表示了很大的兴趣。因此我说，中国有很多值得可以看一看的地方，希望你在你认为方便的时候到中国来看一看。天皇表示愿意来看一看，但是他说此事还要与日本政府商量。
    有日本记者提问说，他作为日本记者想从日本的角度提一个为何在李总理在人大的政治报告中有关国际关系里把日本放在最后提的问题。李鹏总理说，请记者先生不要忘记一个事实：在人大闭幕以后不久就来日本访问，而且是今年首次出访，大概不能说我们对日本的关系不重视吧？说我们只重视与日本的经济关系，不重视政治关系，也不太公平。我来日本３天会见了几乎所有政界领导人和几位前首相，大概记者先生不能说他们是经济界人士吧！希望你改变这种印象。
    关于中苏关系问题，李总理说，５月份即将举行的中苏高级会晤，主要是谈中苏国家关系正常化问题，当然也要谈柬埔寨问题。主要就国际关系和双边关系交换意见。会谈结束以后当然要发表一个文字性的东西，至于叫什么名称，双方正在商议之中。名称不重要，主要是看它的内容。内容主要是记录这次在哪些问题上取得了一致意见或者包括哪些问题没有取得一致。我想不会是条约或宣言之类。这次高级会晤我相信对于进一步改善中苏关系以及对亚太地区和世界的和平都会产生积极影响。
    在戈尔巴乔夫主席访问中国时，赵紫阳总书记将和他会见。戈尔巴乔夫是苏联共产党的总书记，两位总书记既然见了面，自然意味着两党关系的恢复。所谓恢复关系是今后两党可以接触，两党的领导人和两党的部门之间可以接触。我们和世界上许多的共产党、社会党、劳动党、民族主义的政党都有这样的关系。但中苏两党之间不存在政策方面的协调问题。
    中国外长钱琪琛陪同李鹏总理出席了记者招待会。
