Two Poems in Memory of Huang Yan
Du Mu Rongliang

I
Eulogies are frequent but cannot dispel the sorrow; I wish to express my grief, but my bones have already withered.
The swift horse has become a terracotta warrior, and the plow still needs the sick cow to pull it.
We had planned to collaborate on poetry and painting, but it was difficult to fulfill.
We had planned to sing together the songs of Taiwan, but it was difficult to realize.
On New Year's Eve, I spent the time in the hospital in vain; the morning wind suddenly reported the breaking of the pine tree.

II
Hearing the news of his passing while sick, my illness worsens.
Human affairs are already enough to choke on.
In the past, he carved wood for the "Field of Life and Death," and after ten years of turmoil, he bloomed again.
He sharpened his stone to hone his poetry, and his pen was like a burning flame.
It is difficult to calm the surging waters of the East River, and I await the keen eyes to compile his works.
Huang Yan worked at the Gannan Newspaper and created illustrations for "Field of Life and Death," sending them to me from afar. I was then the editor of "Times Literature," and I published them immediately. At that time, the mail was obstructed, but as long as we received them, we published them. Later, Huang Yan went to Taiwan, and he invited me to meet him, but the shipwreck incident occurred, and the plan was abandoned. In the 1950s, we met in Beijing, just about to create with all our might, but the movements arose one after another, and our plans all became bubbles. After the ten-year catastrophe, Huang Yan's spirit was invigorated, and he wanted to create a series of illustrations for Lu Xun's "New Stories" and collect his old works to compile them into a volume, asking me to write a preface for it. Last year, I was sick, and he was also unwell, but he still took up his brush to paint my portrait. Now he has suddenly passed away, how can the sorrow be expressed? I write this poem to mourn him.

　　挽荒烟诗二首
　　端木蕻良
            一
    悼词频作意难消，欲写哀思骨已销。
    骏驰已作兵马俑，耕种还须病牛挑。
    空约联制诗画配，难践同歌宝岛谣。
    除夕医院虚度岁，晓风忽报折松标。
    　　　　二
    病里闻耗病转煎，人间百事已足咽。
    当年刻木生死场，十载劫灰再花天。
    砺石磨刀诗律细，溶情入木笔锋燃。
    难平激荡东江水，待来锐眼辑遗篇。
    荒烟在赣南报社工作时，即为《生死场》作插图，远道寄余。余方主编《时代文学》，即予发表。当时邮路阻滞，但凡收到，皆得刊出。后荒烟去台，函约余赴台相晤，旋因沉船事件发生作罢。５０年代于京中相会，正欲奋力创作，而运动迭起，约言、计划皆成泡影。１０年浩劫后，荒烟精神振奋，欲为鲁迅《故事新编》作系列插图，并收集旧作，编辑成册，要余为之作序待版。前年余在病中，彼亦不适，尚操刀为余造像。今竟遽然殒殁，悲痛何如，诗以悼之。
