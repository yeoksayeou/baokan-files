Title: Cracking Down on "In-House Deception"

The *People's Daily* reported on March 12th that in the 35 years since the founding of the nation, the reported total area of afforestation nationwide was 13.7 billion mu; however, the actual surveyed area is only 4.2 billion mu. It turns out that about half of the annual reported afforestation area is false, and the survival rate of the actual afforestation area is only 40%. If we cannot accept criticism of our "in-house fighting," then at least we should acknowledge that our "in-house deception" is a fact.

The origins of "in-house deception" are yet to be verified, but it is certain that this practice was rampant during the "Great Leap Forward." Stories like "backyard furnaces producing high-quality steel" and "salt marshes yielding 10,000 jin of rice per mu" were common, deceiving many leaders into euphoria and rash decision-making, leading to three consecutive years of famine.

The lessons should have been painful enough, but unfortunately, they were not learned. Take afforestation as an example: the masses have long ridiculed it as "planting numbers and creating zeros"—planting numbers on paper and creating "green in spring, yellow in summer, and into the stove in autumn." Is there no other way? No, there isn't. The author has heard such conversations over the phone several times:

"How many trees did your county plant on Arbor Day?"

"Spring came late this year, so it's not quite the right time to plant trees yet!"

"But your county is lagging behind; other counties have already planted five or six million trees."

"Then report five million five thousand trees for our county!"

Thus, five million five thousand trees (what the masses call "numbers") are planted on paper with just one sentence. Then it is reported up the chain of command.

It's not just in tree planting that deception occurs; it's relatively minor. Reform and opening up are such significant matters that the Party Central Committee has listed them as one of the two fundamental points. Yet, there is still "in-house deception" in this area. Some people embezzle money and goods, set up "briefcase companies," use their power to act as "official speculators," and even demand bribes and accept gifts, creating a chaotic situation until public discontent arises. When rectification and management come, these people slip away like "Earth Traveler" using "earth escape." Moreover, they continue to issue directives to subordinates and report experiences to superiors. Some superiors and their superiors, upon seeing these experiences written with vivid details, substance, and impressive lists like 1, 2, 3, 4, A, B, C, D, eagerly forward and publish them, making a big fuss. This results in superiors being pleased, subordinates being disgruntled, and the masses developing a "reverse psychology" towards reform, clean governance, and other slogans and policies, severely damaging their confidence and initiative.

For some people, deception can bring benefits; but for the people, that trick is absolutely not something to eat. Look at some units: although they have become "experience summary specialists," the lives of the common people are not better than elsewhere.

### 治治“窝里骗”

　　治治“窝里骗”
    润农
    ３月１２日《人民日报》载：建国３５年来，全国上报造林面积为１３．７亿亩；而调查结果保存面积仅４．２亿亩。原来，每年上报造林面积中约有一半是虚的，另一半是造林面积中成活率也只有４０％。如果对有人批评我们“窝里斗”不能接受的话，那起码应该承认我们的“窝里骗”是事实。
    “窝里骗”源于何时，尚待考证；可以确认的是，“大跃进”时此风已经甚盛，“小高炉炼出优质钢”、“盐碱滩亩产万斤稻”之类的卫星天天在放，“糊弄”得许多领导人心花怒放，头脑发热——然后是决策失误，连续三年饥馑。
    教训应该说够惨痛的，遗憾的是没有认真汲取。即以前面所说的植树造林为例吧，早有群众讥讽之曰“植数造零”：植的是纸上之数，造的是“春天绿，夏天黄，秋天进灶膛”的零。不这样不行么？不行。笔者曾几次听到过这样的电话：
    “你们乡植树节那天栽了多少树哇？”
    “今年春来的晚，现在种树还不大到时候呢！”
    “可就你们乡落后哇，别的乡都种了五六万棵了。”
    “那也给我们乡报五万五千棵吧！”
    于是，五万五千棵树（即群众称之为“数”者）一句话就栽在纸上。然后又是层层上报。
    仅仅在种树这一类事上糊弄，还算是小焉者也。改革开放搞活是多么大的事情，党中央把它列为两个基本点之一，可一样有搞“窝里骗”的。有些人自己搂钱、搂东西，办皮包“公司”，靠权力当“官倒”，以至于索要贿赂、收受礼品，搞得乌烟瘴气、直到民怨四起，整顿治理来了，这些人早像“土行孙”一样身子一扭，乘“土遁”溜掉了。而且，照样向下级发指示，向上级报经验。而一些上级和上级的上级，一见这些经验写得有鼻子有眼，有骨头有肉，一二三四、ＡＢＣＤ挺能唬人，也便忙不迭转发、登报，煞有介事，热热闹闹。这就弄得上面眉开眼笑，下面怨声四起，群众对改革、对廉政建设等方面的口号和政策产生“逆反心理”，信心和积极性大受挫伤。
    对于某些人来说，欺骗可以带来好处；但对于人民群众来说，那玩艺绝对当不了饭吃。不信请看某些单位，虽然成了“总结经验专业户”，但百姓的日子并不比别处好过。
