Agriculture is the most fundamental industry for the survival and development of human society. Despite differences in social systems and economic development levels among countries, many nations not only regard the development of agriculture as a primary measure to improve people's lives and promote economic prosperity, but also as a strategic task to drive social progress, maintain political stability, and consolidate world peace.

The current global agricultural situation requires accelerating the pace of agricultural development.

The global food and agricultural situation has improved significantly over the past 20 years. From 1961 to 1985, world agricultural production increased by an average of 2.5% per year. Although the global population increased by nearly 2 billion, the overall nutritional level of people has also improved. However, there are still imbalances between regions and years.

Developed countries, which account for 1/4 of the world's population, have a relatively solid agricultural foundation and high levels of science and technology and production. Most of these countries have abundant food supplies. In contrast, developing countries, which account for 3/4 of the world's population, although their agricultural development has been rapid, most of these countries have low production levels and insufficient food supplies, or the growth rate of food production lags behind the population growth rate. In the past two years, global agricultural production has shown signs of slowing down and stagnating. According to statistics from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the average annual growth rate of world agriculture was 2.4% from 1970 to 1980, 2.5% from 1980 to 1986, but it dropped to 0.7% in 1987, with a grain reduction of 0.3%. In 1988, agricultural growth was 0.4%, with a grain reduction of 3.3%. At the same time, the world's grain production has been below the total demand for two consecutive years. In 1988, the world's grain inventory was only 287 million tons, a 28% decrease from the previous year, equivalent to only 16% of the 1989 consumption trend, which is lower than the world food security ratio (inventory accounts for 17-18% of consumption). This is the lowest level since the global food crisis in the early 1970s. Therefore, accelerating agricultural development, producing more food, and further increasing farmers' income have become an important task in the global economic system.

Developed countries have always placed agriculture in a certain important position.

The proportion of agriculture in the national economy of developed countries is relatively small, and the agricultural population is not large. However, due to the significant impact of agriculture on various aspects, they still pay considerable attention to it. For example, in 1985, the yield per unit area of crops in the United States was 40% higher than in 1965. Previously, one farmer could support 58 people, but now one farmer can support 75 people. The development of American agriculture cannot be separated from the support of various industries. There are 18.9 million people engaged in the storage, transportation, processing, and sales of agricultural products, and consumers spend $361 billion on agricultural products. One-quarter of American agricultural products are exported overseas, occupying an important position in the international market. The adjustment of the U.S. government's agricultural policies also fully considers the interests of farmers and the development of agricultural trade.

After the end of World War II, the Federal Republic of Germany focused on the development of agriculture. In 1950, one farmer could support 10 people, in 1970, 32 people, and in 1987, 67 people. Currently, they still pay attention to the adjustment of agricultural policies, aiming to reduce costs, reduce labor, improve agricultural productivity, ensure an appropriate living standard for the agricultural population, and fully consider increasing farmers' income and protecting the rural ecological environment.

Japan is an island country with scarce per capita land resources. The price of domestically produced agricultural products is generally four times higher than the international market price. Therefore, to avoid the high cost, Japan prefers to import a large amount of agricultural products. However, they still attach great importance to domestic staple food self-sufficiency. For example, the production policy for rice is to insist on self-sufficiency and balance supply and demand to ensure national stability and economic development.

The Soviet Union has not grasped agriculture effectively, and agricultural production has developed slowly, failing to meet the improving living standards of the people. Currently, the per capita annual grain possession in the Soviet Union is over 700 kilograms, while the actual annual per capita consumption is 1,000 kilograms. Therefore, an average of 20 to 35 million tons of grain and feed are imported each year. The variety and quality of food in the Soviet Union are seriously lagging behind those of other developed countries, indicating that strengthening agriculture has become an important task for the Soviet Union's current economic development.

Developing countries should pay more attention to agricultural development.

Agriculture in developing countries generally accounts for more than 40-50% of the gross national product, and the labor force engaged in agriculture generally accounts for 2/3 of the total labor force. With the rapid population growth, developing agriculture is a long-term and arduous task. In the 1950s and 1960s, many developing countries generally focused on industrial development and had insufficient understanding of agricultural development. The backwardness of agriculture also affected industrial development. In the early 1970s, most countries began to pay attention to agricultural development, and the growth rate of agriculture accelerated. However, the development was very uneven. From 1980 to 1986, only 18 developing countries had an annual agricultural growth rate of more than 4%. According to statistics from 108 developing countries, in 1988, 58 countries did not increase their per capita production.

Developing countries in Asia account for more than half of the world's total population, and agricultural population accounts for 70% of the world's total agricultural population, but arable land is less than 30% of the world's total. Countries like the Philippines and India have adjusted their economic development strategies since the 1970s to promote domestic agricultural production and reduce dependence on the international market. For example, India imported several hundred million tons of grain, even up to a thousand million tons, in the 1950s and 1960s. By the late 1970s, grain was self-sufficient and could be exported.

In the West Asia region, most countries are arid or semi-arid, with scarce water resources and forests covering only 10% of the land. The agricultural foundation is relatively weak. In the past decade, some oil-exporting countries have invested heavily to strengthen infrastructure, import inputs and modern technology, and adopt subsidy policies. Agriculture and grain production have grown rapidly. For example, countries like Kuwait and Saudi Arabia previously relied on imports for half of their grain. Since the 1970s, they have vigorously developed agriculture, and in recent years, the agricultural growth rate has been above 10-20%, significantly improving the self-sufficiency of grain. However, some low-income countries still have unstable agricultural production, and the population is flowing from rural areas to cities and from non-oil-producing countries to oil-exporting countries, leading to a shortage of agricultural labor.

In African countries, the population growth is fast, and the urbanization process is rapid. Many countries do not pay enough attention to agriculture and rural development, have poor infrastructure, insufficient agricultural investment, and improper management of agricultural resources, resulting in many problems. In the past 20 years, most countries have begun to pay attention to agriculture, and the situation has gradually improved. For example, Côte d'Ivoire in West Africa, after gaining independence in 1960, utilized its advantageous natural conditions to vigorously develop agriculture, promoting significant economic development. In the past 20 years, the national economy has grown at an average annual rate of over 7.5%, and per capita national income has increased from $150 in 1960 to $1,293 in 1980.

Most countries in Latin America have focused on developing an export-oriented economy, neglecting agriculture, while the funds needed for industrial development, in addition to relying on foreign loans, also rely on the export of agricultural and mineral products. Agriculture, in order to face exports and cities, focuses on developing commodity production with large and medium-sized farms as the mainstay, paying insufficient attention to the numerous small farms, with poor investment and technology promotion, resulting in slow and unstable production development. Therefore, most rural areas are still relatively poor and cannot be self-sufficient in grain. Now, many countries believe that developing agriculture is the key to economic recovery and structural adjustment, and an important condition for achieving social progress and political stability. These countries are strengthening agricultural construction.

　　世界农业的现状和趋向
　　朱丕荣
    农业是人类社会赖以生存和发展的最基本的产业部门。尽管各国社会制度和经济发展水平不同，但许多国家不仅把发展农业作为改善人民生活、繁荣经济的首要措施，而且作为推动社会进步、保持政治稳定、巩固世界和平的战略任务。
    当前世界农业形势要求加快农业发展步伐
    全球粮食和农业状况近20多年来有了很大改善。1961—1985年世界农业产量平均每年增长2.5％，尽管全球人口增加了近20亿，但人们总的营养水平仍有所提高。当然地区和年份之间还存在着不平衡。
    占世界1／4人口的发达国家农业基础较好，科技和生产水平较高，大多数国家粮食充裕，而占3／4人口的发展中国家虽然农业发展速度较快，但大多数国家由于生产水平不高，粮食供应不足，或者粮食增长速度落后于人口增长速度。近两年来，世界农业生产出现了速度减慢和徘徊的状况。据联合国粮农组织统计，1970—1980年世界农业平均年增长2.4％，1980—1986年为2.5％，但1987年下降到0.7％，其中粮食减产0.3％，1988年农业增长0.4％，其中粮食减产3.3％。同时，世界谷物产量连续两年低于总需求量。1988年度世界谷物库存量只有2.87亿吨，比上年度下降28％，只相当于1989年消费趋势水平的16％，已经低于世界粮食安全系数（储存量占消费量的17—18％）。这是70年代初期世界粮食危机以来的最低水平。因此，加快发展农业，生产更多的粮食，进一步增加农民收入，已成为世界经济体系的一项重要任务。
    发达国家始终把农业放在一定的重要地位
    发达国家的农业在整个国民经济中的比重较小，农业人口不多，但由于农业对各方面的影响较大，所以他们对农业依然比较重视。例如，美国1985年农作物单产比1965年增加40％，过去一个农民可养活58人，现在可养活75人。美国农业的发展，离不开各行各业的支持。服务于农产品储运、加工和销售的达1890万人，社会消费者用于农产品的开支费用达3610亿美元。美国的农产品有1／4出口海外，在国际市场上占重要地位。美国政府农业政策的调整，也充分考虑农民的利益和农产品贸易的发展。
    联邦德国在第二次世界大战结束后，重视了大力发展农业。1950年每个农民可养活10人，1970年可养活32人， 1987年可养活67人。目前仍重视农业政策的调整，其目标是降低成本，减轻劳动，提高农业生产率，保证农业人口的适当生活水平，并充分考虑增加农民收入，保护农村生态环境。
    日本是一个岛国，人均土地资源稀缺，国内生产的农产品价格一般要比国际市场高出四倍，因此，为避免负担高昂的成本，日本宁愿大量进口农产品。但即便如此，他们仍高度重视国内主粮自给。如对大米的生产方针是坚持自给，产需平衡，以确保国家稳定和经济的发展。
    苏联对农业抓得不够得力，农业生产发展缓慢，跟不上日益改善的人民生活需要。全苏目前人均年占有粮食700多公斤，而实际人均年消费需1000公斤，因此，平均每年要进口谷物饲料2000万到3500万吨。苏联的食品品种和质量严重落后于其他发达国家，可见，大力加强农业已成为苏联目前发展经济的一个重要课题。
    发展中国家应当更加重视发展农业
    发展中国家的农业在国民生产总值中一般占40—50％以上，从事农业的劳动力一般占总劳力的2／3。加上人口增长较快，发展农业是一项长期艰巨的任务。50年代和60年代，许多发展中国家一般都努力发展工业，对发展农业认识不足，农业的落后也影响了工业发展。70年代初期，大多数国家开始重视农业的发展，农业增长速度加快。但发展很不平衡。1980—1986年发展中国家中农业年增长4％以上的国家只有18个。据108个发展中国家的统计，1988年人均产量没有增加的竟有58个。
    亚洲发展中国家人口占世界总人口的一半多，农业人口占世界农业总人口的70％，可耕地却不到世界的30％。菲律宾、印度等国自70年代以来，调整经济发展战略，努力促进本国农业增产，减少对国际市场的依赖。如印度50年代和60年代每年要进口几百万吨甚至上千万吨粮食，70年代后期粮食已自给有余、可以出口。
    西亚地区，大部分国家干旱或半干旱，水资源缺乏，森林只占土地的10％，农业基础较差。近10多年来一些石油输出国大量投入，加强基础设施、进口投入物和现代技术，并采取补贴政策，农业和粮食增长较快。如科威特、沙特阿拉伯等国过去粮食一半依靠进口，70年代以来，大力发展农业，近年来农业增长幅度在10—20％以上，大大提高了粮食自给程度。但一些低收入国家农业生产仍不稳定，人口流向城市和从非产油国流向石油输出国，农业劳力短缺。
    非洲国家人口增长快，加上城市化发展速度快，许多国家对农业和农村发展关心不够，基础设施差，农业投入不足，对农业资源管理不当，问题较多。近20年来，大多数国家开始对农业重视，情况逐步趋于好转。如西非的科特迪瓦1960年独立后利用优越的自然条件，大力发展农业，促进了经济大发展，近20年来国民经济平均年增长高达7.5％以上，人均国民收入从1960年的150美元增加到1980年的1293美元。
    拉美的多数国家由于重视发展外向型经济，轻视农业，而发展工业需要的资金，除依靠借用外债外，还依靠农产品和矿产品出口。农业为了面向出口和城市，重点发展以大中型农场为主的商品性生产，对数量庞大的小农场不够重视，其投入和技术推广较差，生产发展缓慢而不稳定，因此大部分农村仍较贫困，粮食不能自给。现在许多国家认为，发展农业是经济复苏、调整结构的关键，也是争取社会进步和政治稳定的重要条件。这些国家正在加强农业建设。
