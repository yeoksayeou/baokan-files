The daughter of a district committee secretary in Nanjing working as a welder was hailed by a certain newspaper as a new phenomenon, praised for "not using connections, not taking the back door," as if working as a welder was a great sacrifice for her. Some people couldn't stand it and countered with "What should the 'princess' of a district committee secretary do?" published in the November 1988 issue of *Guangming Daily*. I dare not comment, but I would like to discuss the matter of the common people's children.

Through the media, we have learned about many families where three generations work in coal mines, cleaning services, or funeral services, and these are hailed as "advanced deeds." Every time I read these stories, I am not moved but rather feel sad. These professions are indispensable and should be respected by society, but in reality, this is not the case. One example is that we have not seen many "secretaries'" children joining these honorable ranks. It is commendable for the children of common people to follow in their parents' footsteps, but for many of these children, if they do not follow their parents' professions and do not work as coal miners, cleaners, or funeral workers, it is very difficult for them to have better choices.

Looking back ten years to the return of the educated youth, there was an unwritten rule at the time: whichever department the educated youth came from, they would be assigned to that department. This allowed the children of cadres to enter government offices through the front door, followed by paid study of the "Five Classics," graduation, becoming a cadre, joining the party, and being promoted. After the gates opened, the phenomenon of fathers and sons, mothers and daughters entering and exiting government offices side by side can still be seen everywhere. But what about the common people's children among the educated youth? Many of them wandered the streets and alleys, and some even had to "re-join the countryside" for a second time.

We should not avoid talking about the flaws in our country's recruitment system, nor should we hide the ugly deeds of those in power who use their authority for personal gain. Some people have even arranged housing for their grandchildren while still in swaddling clothes, but many children of common people, after marrying and having children who are already in elementary school, are still living in collective dormitories. Do the common people's children also matter to them?

If society still allows "dragon begets dragon, phoenix begets phoenix, and the children of rats dig holes" to exist, then this society will find it difficult to progress even with reform.

　　百姓儿女该做啥？
    严钦
    南京市某区委书记的女儿当电焊工，被某报作为新事物宣扬，吹为“有关系不用，有后门不走”，好像做了电焊工就委屈了她。有人看不过眼，反诘《区委书记的“千金”究竟应该干什么》，登在去年１１月的《光明日报》。我不敢妄议，只想谈点百姓儿女的事。
    通过新闻媒介，知道不少家庭三代当煤矿工、清洁工，两代数口从事殡仪业的“先进事迹”。每逢看了这些文字，我总感动不起来，反倒觉得难过。这些职业不可缺少，理应受到全社会的敬重，但实际上并非如此。其例证之一，就是至今未见有多少“书记”们的儿女走入这光荣的队列。百姓儿孙子承父业，当然堪值嘉奖，但对许多百姓的儿女来说，如果不接父母的班，不去干煤矿工、清洁工、殡葬工，是很难有更佳的选择的。
    回顾十年前知青大回城，当时有一条不成文的规定，哪部门的知青哪部门安排。这就使得干部子弟堂而皇之从前门踏进机关门坎，接着带薪读“五大”，毕业，转干，入党，提拔。闸门开后，父子母女从机关门洞比肩进出的现象，至今到处可见。而知青中那些百姓的子弟呢？不少人徬徨街头，游荡巷尾，甚至不得不重新“二次插队”。
    不应该讳言我国招工机制的弊病，也不必掩饰某些手握实权者以权谋私的丑行。有人连襁褓中孙子的住房也给办妥了，可许多百姓子女婚后数年生下孩子已读小学，却还挤在集体宿舍。百姓儿女做什么，是否也像对待自己子女一样放在心头呢？
    社会如果尚容“龙生龙，凤生凤，老鼠的儿女打地洞”存在，那这个社会再改革也是难以前进的。（作者单位：广西钦州地委宣传部）
