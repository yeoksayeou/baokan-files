The year 1958 was a year of fervor in China. Yang Sizhi, a small-statured individual, carried his heavy luggage filled with books over scorching red stone mountains to trek from Gaoshi Primary School to Xiaoying Primary School. Two years prior, he had graduated from a teachers' college and was teaching in Gaoshi. A young man of seventeen or eighteen, he managed his duties exceptionally well and was selected to become the principal of a key rural primary school in Jiangxi, overseeing a school with a thousand students.

Xiaoying School was located in a high-walled ancestral hall in Xiaoying Village, Bailu Township, Yingtan City. The doors and windows were old and dilapidated, and the beams and pillars were riddled with termite holes. Yang Sizhi dropped his luggage and drank large mouthfuls of cold tea, panting heavily. At that moment, "snowflakes" began to flutter down from the ceiling beams, and his tea cup was filled with termite-drilled wood shavings. Oh, as soon as he entered, the termites issued their first challenge!

He stared at the large round pillars, each one riddled with termite holes like a copper sieve; he tapped them, and they produced a hollow "clack, clack, clack" sound. The teachers brought out bamboo beds, desks, mosquito nets, and students' notebooks for the principal to see, all bearing the marks of termite infestation. "Doesn't the higher-ups provide any funds?" asked the young but mature principal. "Funds are allocated every year," the teachers replied, "but we repair one year and tear down the next. We can replace windows but not pillars, what's the use?"

Dangerous building! Dangerous building! Dangerous building! The situation threatened teaching, living, and even survival, making termites Yang Sizhi's number one enemy. He sought advice from old farmers, but they shook their heads: "Godly insects require godly people to control them; how can we who eat grains and cereals do anything about them?" He wrote letters and sent samples to the Jiangxi branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, but received no response. He heard that Li Shiming from the South China Institute of Entomology in Guangzhou could treat termites and considered writing to him, but feared the scholar might not respond. Nevertheless, he mustered his courage and wrote. To his surprise, the renowned termite expert from across the nation replied within days: "Termites can be controlled." He also sent a copy of his self-published book, "Termites and Their Control": "If you encounter difficulties, feel free to contact me. I welcome cooperation!"

Wow, the more learned a person is, the more humble they are, thought Yang Sizhi, deeply grateful. He held the book and read it by lamplight. During his spare time, he wandered around the village, observing the activity patterns of termites. Whenever he had questions, he wrote to Li Shiming for advice. Thus, a nationally renowned authority and an unknown young man were brought together by a tiny insect, forming a teacher-student bond and a lifelong friendship.

The teacher guided the student into the kingdom of termites, and Yang Sizhi entered the termite labyrinth. He discovered that this labyrinth was a vast and strictly hierarchical kingdom, a world full of wonders. It had termite kings and queens, worker termites, and soldier termites, each with clearly defined roles: who commanded, who foraged, who stood guard. It was the oldest (existing 250 million years ago), longest-lived (queens could live up to 80 years), most numerous (2,442 species worldwide), fastest-reproducing (a mature queen could lay 80,000 eggs per night), and most destructive (capable of destroying any building, furniture, or levee) insect in the world. Facing this formidable enemy, Yang Sizhi in his year of fervor remained calm. He accepted the termites' challenge with a cool head.

One night, Yang Sizhi held a lantern and went to the toilet. Suddenly, he saw a few moths fluttering around the light. He quickly shone the light on them, and the moths flew out of a breeding hole in a wooden pillar in the toilet. Ah, it was May, the breeding season. He immediately called for torches and shovels, and starting from the breeding hole, he dug down the termite trail inch by inch. He dug until the next noon, and indeed, 12 meters away under a peach tree, he unearthed a termite nest larger than a basket, weighing 15 kilograms!

Another day, Yang Sizhi was on his way to a village school to guide teaching along the Yellow Qishi Reservoir. Walking on the levee, he discovered breeding holes of large yellow-winged termites. Oh no, "A thousand-mile golden levee can be breached by a single hole." If the termites were not eradicated, who knows when the levee might collapse, causing a disaster. To destroy the nest, he carried a straw mat, an alarm clock, and a notebook to sleep on the levee every night, fearless of jackals and venomous snakes. A few nights, he had a fever of 39 degrees but did not stop. On the 18th day at 4:20 AM, yellow-winged termites flew out of the breeding hole. Following the termite trail, he dug and found another large termite nest, also weighing 15 kilograms!

Yang Sizhi's fame spread quickly, and farmers praised him as a godly man: "He can chant incantations, summon termites, and bind termites!" "If there are termites, go find the principal!" "The godly insect has met its match, now it can be controlled!" The farmers of Yangtang Village, where termites caused the most damage, heard that termites feared white roosters and raised over a hundred white roosters, but to no avail: houses built three years ago collapsed, clothes left on a stool overnight were riddled with holes, and lunch left on the stove in the morning was covered with termites by noon. The farmers invited the godly man: "If you can truly bind termites, we'll slaughter a rooster for you to eat." Yang Sizhi looked carefully: "Is this true?" "It's true!" "No tricks?" "No tricks!" "Good, call the carpenter to bring an axe and chisel!" The carpenter came, and following the principal's instructions, he dug three holes in a camphor tree. Termites crawled out of the holes. Yang Sizhi took out a spray gun, sprayed the holes, and then sealed them with yellow mud. He instructed the villagers: "Do not open the holes without my command. After 15 days, come and shovel out the termites!" Half a month later, people surrounded the large camphor tree in three layers. Young men opened the holes and shoveled out two baskets of dead termites.

Word spread quickly, and Yang Sizhi became a legendary figure in Yingtan. In a few years, he provided effective and free services to 96 households, truly becoming a "godly man" revered by the farmers.

C-A-85 Composite Termite Control Agent

Digging along termite trails to find nests was indeed a primitive, labor-intensive method of termite control. Because using axes and shovels would damage buildings, trees, and levees, it was necessary to pay a price. How to prevent rather than cure, and transition from physical labor to intellectual labor, was a question Yang Sizhi considered further.

Before this, the termite control agent used in China was chlorodane. It was a highly irritating and carcinogenic agent with a strong odor, and it had long been discontinued abroad. Could a low-toxicity, high-efficiency, odorless, and non-polluting agent be produced to replace it? He went to Yingtan No. 1 Middle School to find Ai Laoshi, his chemistry teacher from his teacher training days, seeking support. The teacher was moved and worked tirelessly with him: the school lacked experimental reagents, so they borrowed from factories; the laboratory was only available on Sundays, so he used Saturday nights to walk 17 miles from the primary school to the middle school, and on Sunday nights, he returned to the primary school after completing the experiments, undeterred by wind and rain. Along the way, there was a barren hill where over a hundred Nationalist soldiers were buried. On rainy nights, the phosphorescent light was green and eerie. Yang Sizhi held an umbrella and hurried along, seeing two jackals with green eyes crouching by the road. He gripped the umbrella handle tightly, singing a nonsensical song, and advancing towards them with the umbrella. In the end, good prevailed over evil, and the jackals slinked away, tails between their legs. When he returned home, his back was soaked with cold sweat.

After 700 days and 85 chemical experiments, the sedimentation problem was solved, and he began animal experiments, catching sparrows, rats, and frogs, and comparing his homemade agent with other termite control agents. After experiments on 218 rats, 270 sparrows, and 140 frogs, it was proven that his invention was the most effective, with the highest killing power.

His experiments were fully supported by his wife, who was also a teacher in the village school. At that time, their combined monthly income was only 58.5 yuan, but they still managed to save over 300 yuan to buy reagents and a used microscope. This room, which served as both a bedroom and a biochemistry laboratory, was less than 9 square meters and always smelled of chemicals, but they lived there for three to five years. She took on all the household chores as a wife and mother and helped her husband with observations and records at night. She filled 6 out of 12 notebooks. One day, she took the entire class to the reservoir for a swim, and three students drowned. She panicked and rushed to save them. When she pushed the third drowning student onto the shore, she was already exhausted and sank, never to resurface. Yang Sizhi wept bitterly over the loss of such a life partner, business partner, and professional confidante. But when he thought of their unfinished work, he completed his wife's funeral and entrusted their only three-year-old son to his mother-in-law in Shangrao. On the third day, he returned to his material experiments.

This was a substantive experiment to observe the effect of the agent on pine wood for termite control. He took 28 pieces of pine wood of the same volume and weight, divided them into 4 groups, with 7 pieces in each group. In each group, 6 pieces were soaked in the agent while 1 piece was not. Then, he buried them in the soil where termites were active and observed them once a year. After three years, the results were: the pieces soaked in Yang Sizhi's agent were intact with a damage rate of zero, while the damage rate for other agents ranged from 29% to 65%, and the unsoaked pieces had a damage rate of 69.25%, reduced to mere skeletons.

On October 13, 1984, the National Termite Control Academic Conference was held in Huicheng, Guangdong. Yang Sizhi's paper presentation attracted full attention. British scholar Dr. Ren Peiyu immediately offered 250,000 pounds to buy his patent. Professor Shi Zhenhua, a renowned chemistry expert from the Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences, nodded in approval, excited by the 20-year struggle that had led to today's achievements. He gestured for Yang Sizhi to come closer: "I have two questions for you. First, is there any sedimentation?" "None." The professor raised his thumb: "Good. Second, I suggest you don't name the agent in Chinese. Change it to the first letter of the main element in the agent's name in English. What do you think?" Yang Sizhi quickly understood the value of the agent's confidentiality and the weight of the professor's advice, "Good, from now on, I'll call it 'C-A-85 Composite Termite Control Agent.' Is that okay?" "Okay. But it should have a code name," the professor said seriously and jokingly, "Your experiment went through 227 trials, so the code name will be 227."

One of the 99 in the Nation

On July 9, 1982, the commander of a certain military unit's warehouse, Song, rushed to Yang Sizhi's home in a jeep. At that time, his family had gone to bed, and only a lamp accompanied him as he read. The commander urgently reported to the director of the Yingtan Termite Control Research Institute: termites had invaded the underground military warehouse made of reinforced concrete, causing two boxes of military equipment bound for the front lines of the self-defense counterattack to be delayed, resulting in a loss of 7.84 million yuan.

Yang Sizhi jumped into the jeep and rushed to the underground warehouse under the starry night. He was astonished. This place was entirely made of red stone mountains with Danxia landforms. Tunnels were blasted open, and the tunnels were reinforced with reinforced concrete. The two large doors were made of four-inch thick steel plates, and grease was applied to the gaps, making it impregnable. How could termites invade?

Yet, there were 36 breeding holes on the arch of the warehouse and the two walls. Upon investigation, it was found that during construction, winged reproductive termites were attracted by the light and flew into the cave, hiding and breeding there. Some also entered through the drainage ditches and ground expansion joints. Yang Sizhi treated the symptoms and took measures: he sprayed the breeding holes with the agent to kill the termites, placed bait piles at the drainage ditches, and used termite control agents mixed with cement to fill the expansion joints. Several years passed, and the 78,000 square meters of 7 underground military warehouses he treated were all termite-free, protecting tens of thousands of tons of war reserve materials and advanced weapons from harm, making a significant contribution to national defense construction.

For 30 years, Yang Sizhi has fought in the termite kingdom, achieving remarkable results and numerous victories:

In addition to achieving significant results in large-scale termite prevention and control, he has published 26 valuable academic papers, completed 12 large and small research projects, including one international first, three national firsts, and four projects at the advanced level in the country.

He was inspired by the records in "Compendium of Materia Medica" that termites can treat diseases and that Africans enjoy eating termites. After successfully treating his severe neurasthenia with termite queens soaked in honey, he discovered that termites contain 14 essential trace elements for the human body, more than 10 vitamins, and 20 amino acids. He successfully developed a low-concentration health-promoting and cancer-preventing termite wine. Recently, he also extracted adenosine phosphate from termites, a highly effective drug for treating heart failure, myocardial infarction, and cerebral arteriosclerosis.

He is now a recipient of the National May Day Labor Medal, a provincial labor model, and one of the 99 workers who have achieved success through self-study in 1987. For 30 years, he has explored the termite kingdom and wandered in the termite labyrinth, never having a Sunday or holiday, and never sleeping before midnight. He is now in his fifties, but with a full head of black hair, abundant energy, and exceptional memory. People joke that it's because he eats too many termites.

He is completely enthralled in the termite palace.

He has been "enthralled" for 30 years and will continue to be "enthralled."

A person's life must be "enthralled" by something. Otherwise, wouldn't it be a waste of a lifetime?

　　他迷醉在白蚁王宫〔报告文学〕
　　程关森
    神虫·神人
    １９５８年，中国的狂热之年。个子很小的杨思齐，挑着沉重的书藉行李，翻越一座座热得发烫的红石头山，从高石小学艰难跋涉到小英小学来。前二年，他师范毕业后就在高石任教，一个十七八岁的青年竟干得不赖，被选拔到江西农村重点小学当校长，执掌千人学校的大权。
    英小设在鹰潭市白露乡小英村的一幢院墙高垒的祠堂里，门窗破旧，梁柱蛀空。杨思齐撂下行李，大口大口地喝着凉茶，喘着粗气。这时屋梁上纷纷扬扬地飘起“雪花”，茶碗里也掉进不少白蚁蛀出的木屑粉了。哟，他一进门，白蚁就给他下达第一道战书！
    他凝视大梁圆柱，处处被白蚁蛀成铜筛般小洞；用手敲击，柱子发出“壳壳壳”之音。老师们搬出竹床、课桌、蚊帐和学生们的作业本给校长看，处处可见白蚁洗劫过的斑痕。“上面也不给点钱吗？”少年得志又少年老成的校长问。“钱，每年都会给一些；可是今年修明年拆，换得了窗换不了柱，于事何补呵！”
    危房！危房！危房！事情已经威胁到教学、生活甚至生存，白蚁就成了杨思齐的头号敌人了。他向老农请教办法，老农摇摇头：神虫要靠神人收，我们吃五谷的岂奈他何？他写信、采标本寄给中科院江西分院，未有作复。他打听到广州中科院中南昆虫研究所李始美会治白蚁，想给他写信，又怕这位大学者不理他。他顾不了这些，斗着胆写了，谁知不出几天，这位全国知名的白蚁专家给他回信了：“白蚁是可以治的。”并赠他一本自著《白蚁及其防治》的书：“有困难，尽管来找我，欢迎合作！”
    乖乖，越有学问的人越谦虚，杨思齐感激涕零。他捧着这本书挑灯就读。课余时间，他在村里四处转悠，观察白蚁活动规律，有问题，便写信向李始美请教。就这样，一个全国权威，一个无名小辈，被一个小小虫子联系起来，融为师生情，结为忘年交。
    老师将弟子引进了白蚁王国的大门，杨思齐从此进入了白蚁迷宫。他发现，这迷宫是一个庞大又等级森严的王国，是一个充满神奇色彩的世界。它有蚁王、蚁后，有工蚁、兵蚁，谁负责指挥，谁担任觅食，谁担任警戒，都分得一清二楚。它是世界上资格最老（二亿五千万年前就有了它）、寿命最长（蚁后可活到８０岁）、数量最多（全世界有２４４２种）、繁殖最快（一只成熟的蚁后每夜产籽８万粒）、为害最大（不论什么建筑、家具、圩堤都可毁坏）的世界性昆虫。面对着这强大的敌人，狂热之年杨思齐并不狂热。他冷静地接受白蚁的挑战。
    一天晚上，杨思齐掌着马灯去厕所，忽见几只飞蛾扑灯。他就势一照，飞蛾是从厕所一根木柱上的分群孔里飞出来的。它就是有翅繁殖蚁。啊，现在是５月，正是分群繁殖的时候。他马上叫人打火把来，扛锄头来，对准分群孔下面的蚁路，一点一点地挖，挖到第二天中午，果然在１２米开外的桃树底下，挖出了一个比箩筐大的蚁巢，一称，１５公斤多！
    又一天，杨思齐路过黄奇石水库到一所村小去指导教学，走在大堤上，发现了黄翅大白蚁的分群孔。糟，“千里金堤，溃于一穴”，如果有蚁不除，说不定什么时候倒堤毁库酿成大灾。为了端掉老巢，他每晚都带上草席、闹钟、笔记本，到堤上睡，不怕豺狗、毒蛇，有几晚发烧到３９度也不间断。等到第１８天４时２０分，分群孔里飞出了黄翅大白蚁，顺着蚁路挖去，又挖到一大蚁巢，１５公斤多！
    杨思齐名声不胫而走，农民把他吹成神人：“他会念咒，会呼白蚁、箍白蚁！”“有白蚁，找校长去！”“神虫碰到了神人，这下有治了！”白蚁为害最烈的杨塘村农民，听说白蚁最怕白公鸡，全村养白公鸡百多只，也不顶用：房子盖了３年就倒，衣服放在凳上过一夜就被咬出一个个洞，上午出工把饭甑搁在灶上，中午回家一看，饭上面尽是一层白蚁。农民将杨神人请去：“如果真的能箍白蚁，一家杀只公鸡给你吃。”杨思齐凝神一看：“此话当真？”“当真！”“不假？”“不假！”“好，请木匠带斧子凿子来！”木匠来了，按照校长吩咐在一棵樟树上挖了３个洞，洞口爬出许多白蚁。杨思齐拿来喷枪，朝洞里喷药，然后用黄泥将洞堵死，交待众乡亲：“没有我的命令，不准开洞。等过了１５天，你们挑粪箕来挑白蚁吧！”半月后，大樟树底下里外三层围满了人。年轻人掏开洞口用铁耙去耙，耙出两粪箕死了的白蚁。
    一传十，十传百，杨思齐成了鹰潭的神话般人物。几年工夫，他为９６户农民进行了有效无偿服务，真正成了深受农民尊崇的“神人”。
　ＣＡ—８５复合防蚁剂
    沿蚁路挖蚁巢，毕竟是原始古老的笨重体力型的灭蚁方法，因为动斧动锄会损坏建筑、树木、圩堤，是需要付出代价的。如何防重于治，实现由体力型向智力型转变，是杨思齐进一步考虑的问题。
    在此之前，我国使用的灭蚁药物是氯丹。它是一种刺激性气味大并有致癌物质的药剂，外国早已停产。能不能生产一种低毒高效无气味无污染的药物来代替它呢？他去鹰潭市一中找到他在师范上学时教过他化学的艾老师，请求支持。老师感动了，不遗余力地和他合作：一中没有化验药品就去工厂借，化验室只有星期天不用，他就专门利用星期天——星期六晚上从１７里外的小学走到一中来，星期天晚上搞完化验又回小学去，风风雨雨从不间断。中途有一荒山岗，那是国民党埋了一百多具士兵尸体的地方，到了雨夜，磷火碧绿，阴气森森。杨思齐撑伞赶路，眼见两只豺狗闪着绿眼睛蹲在路边，他双手紧握伞柄，口里高唱莫名的歌，将伞一收一张朝它走上，结果邪不压正，豺狗拖着尾巴走了，回到家，冷汗打湿了他的背心。
    经过７００多天８５次的化学试验，药品沉淀问题解决了，他就开始作动物试验，抓麻雀，捕老鼠，钓青蛙，用自制药和其他灭蚁药作对比。经过对２１８只老鼠、２７０只麻雀和１４０只青蛙实验，证明他发明的药最为有效，杀伤力最大。
    他的实验，得到当村小教员的爱妻的全力支持。当年，他俩合计只有５８．５元的月工资，还挤出３００多元买药和买一架旧的显微镜。这间充当卧室和生化室的不到９平方米的斗室，终日腥味难闻，但他们两口一住就是三年五载。她承担了作为妻子和母亲的全部家务，并在晚上帮助丈夫作观察记载，１２本笔记本她记的就有６本。一天，她领着全班学生去水库游泳，有三个学生溺水。她慌急了，奋力营救，当她将第三个溺水学生推上岸时，她已精疲力尽沉下去不再起来了。杨思齐为失去这样一位生活上的伴侣、事业上的战友、专业上的知音而抱尸大哭。但当他想到他们未竟的事业，料理完妻子的丧事，将唯一的三岁男孩托孤给上饶的外婆，第三天又去搞他的实物试验了。
    这是将药物作用于松木之后看对白蚁防治效果的实质性的实验。他将２８块同等体积重量的马尾松作试材，分成４组，每组７块，７块中６块浸药一块不浸药，然后埋进有白蚁活动的土中，每年观察一次，三年得出结果：浸过杨思齐制的药物的试材完好无损，损害率为零，浸过其他药物的损害率为２９％—６５％，没有浸药的损害率为６９．２５％，只剩下瘦骨伶仃的骷髅了。
    １９８４年１０月１３日，全国白蚁防治学术会议在广东惠阳市召开，杨思齐宣读论文引起全场注意。英国任佩瑜博士当即要用２５万英镑买他的专利。坐在台下的中国热带植物研究所教授、著名化学专家施振华颔首称道，为他历经２０年坎坷取得今日成果而兴奋不已。他用手把杨思齐召到身边：“我向你提两个问题，一、有没有沉淀？”“没有。”教授竖一竖拇指：“好。二、我建议你的药不要用中文命名，改用药剂主要元素的第一个英文字母命名，好不好？”杨思齐很快领悟到药剂的保密价值和教授忠言的份量，“好，从现在起，我就称它为‘ＣＡ—８５复合防蚁剂’行吗？”“行。不过，它应该有个代号，”教授既认真又戏谑地说：“你的试验经过了２２７次，代号就叫２２７吧。”
　全国９９个中的一个　　１９８２年７月９日，驻军某部仓库宋主任驱着吉普匆匆找到杨思齐的家。此时，家人均睡去，只有一盏灯伴他夜读。主任向这位市白蚁防治研究所所长告急：白蚁已侵入钢筋混凝土的地下军用仓库，有两箱军用设备运往自卫反击战前线，因白蚁蛀过贻误战机不说，光经济损失就达７８４万元。
    杨思齐跳上吉普，星夜赶到地下仓库，大为愕然。这里全是丹霞地貌的红石山，用爆破的方法炸开了隧道，隧道又用钢筋混凝土浇灌，两层大门均用四寸厚钢板制成，门缝中涂有黄油，可谓固若金汤，针插不进，水泼不进，白蚁怎能入侵呢？
    可是仓库拱顶和两壁有３６个分群孔是事实。一查究，原来是施工时有翅繁殖蚁趋着灯光飞进了洞，从此潜伏下来营巢繁衍，也有沿着排水沟和地面伸缩缝钻入的。杨思齐对症下药采取措施：对分群孔喷药杀灭，在排水沟口投放诱杀堆，用防蚁药搅拌水泥填补伸缩缝……几年过去了，经他防治的共计７８０００平方米面积的７个地下军用仓库均没有了白蚁，使数以万吨计的战备物资和高精尖武器免遭危害，为国防建设立下了殊功。
    ３０年来，杨思齐奋战在白蚁王国，战功赫赫，战果累累：
    他除取得大面积防蚁治蚁的显著成果外，还发表了２６篇有价值的科研论文，完成１２项大小科研项目，其中国际首创１项，国内首创３项，国内先进水平４项。
    他从《本草纲目》中白蚁可治病和非洲人爱吃白蚁的记载中得到启迪，用蚁后浸蜜糖治愈了自己严重神经衰弱症以后，发现白蚁含有１４种人体必须的微量元素、１０多种微生素、２０种氨基酸，成功地制成了低浓度健身防癌的螱酒。最近他又从白蚁身上提炼出磷酸腺苷，这是治疗心力衰竭、心肌梗塞、脑动脉硬化的高效药物。
    ——他现在是全总五一劳动奖章获得者，省劳模，全国１９８７年９９个职工自学成才奖获得者之一。３０年来，他在白蚁王国探索，在白蚁迷宫漫游，从来没有星期天、节假日，从来没有在晚上１２点钟以前睡过觉。他已年交半百，但满头黑发，精力充沛，记忆力特强，人家笑他是吃多了白蚁的缘故。
    他在白蚁王宫完全着了迷。
    他“迷”了３０年，还将继续“迷”下去。
    人的一生总要‘迷’点什么。否则，岂不是白混了一辈子。
