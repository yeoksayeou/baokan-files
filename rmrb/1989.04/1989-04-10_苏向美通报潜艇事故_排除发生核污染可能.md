The White House said today that Soviet leader Gorbachev has informed President Bush about the sinking of a Soviet nuclear submarine in the Norwegian Sea.

White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said that Soviet Ambassador to Washington Yuri Dubinin urgently met with State Department officials on Friday evening to deliver a letter from Gorbachev to Bush regarding the submarine's sinking. In the letter, Gorbachev ruled out the possibility of an explosion or leakage of radioactive materials from the nuclear equipment of the sunken submarine. Popadiuk said that the Soviet Union has not requested U.S. assistance in the rescue operation, and the U.S. has not yet been involved in the rescue efforts.

　　苏向美通报潜艇事故  排除发生核污染可能
    新华社华盛顿４月８日电  白宫今天说，苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫已向布什总统通报了一艘苏联核潜艇在挪威海沉没的事件。
    白宫发言人罗曼·波帕杜克说，苏联驻华盛顿大使尤里·杜比宁星期五晚上紧急拜见国务院官员，转交了戈尔巴乔夫给布什的一封有关潜艇沉没的信件。戈尔巴乔夫在信中排除了沉没的核潜艇发生核装置爆炸和泄漏放射性物质的可能性。波帕杜克说，苏联没有向美国提出帮助救援的要求，美国迄今没有卷入救援行动。
