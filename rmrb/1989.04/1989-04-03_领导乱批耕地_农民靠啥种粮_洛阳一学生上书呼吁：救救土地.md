A 14-year-old middle school student from Luoyang wrote a letter to the secretary of the Luoyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Wu Zhenguo, on March 10, urging: "Save our land!" Wu Zhenguo made the following remarks on the letter: If we do not pay attention to the land issue, we will be letting down the next generation. He hopes that cadres at all levels will seriously read this letter.

The student, who lives in Liuhang Village, Xindian Township, Luoyang City, wrote in the letter: The leadership of our village has a serious tendency to arbitrarily approve and occupy arable land. As long as you submit an application, they will approve it for you, regardless of whether you need a homestead or not. He worriedly pointed out that if this continues, year after year approving and building, I am afraid that in a few years our land will be taken away, and it will become a situation where farmers have no land to farm and have to rely on the state for food.

The middle school student also mentioned in the letter that there is a family where all members work outside the village, but the village still approved a courtyard for this family, preparing for when they retire and return to live. Now the house is completely empty. The letter concludes by saying, I am a middle school student, and everything I said is the truth, but I really do not have the courage to reveal my name, fearing that it will bring trouble to my family and me.

　　领导乱批耕地　农民靠啥种粮
    洛阳一学生上书呼吁：救救土地
    据新华社郑州４月１日电  （记者陈朝中、通讯员孔德义）洛阳一名１４岁的中学生３月１０日在给中共洛阳市委书记武振国的信中要求：救救我们的土地吧！武振国就此信作了如下批示，再不重视土地问题将对不起下一代人。他希望各级干部要认真读一读这封信。
    家住洛阳市区辛店乡柳行村的这名学生在信中说：我们村的领导班子乱批乱占耕地歪风严重，不管你是否需要宅基，只要你写一份申请就给你批。他担心地指出，这样年年批，年年盖，我想过不了几年我们的土地就会被吞掉，就会形成农民无田种、伸手向国家要粮食。
    这个中学生在信中反映有一家人都在外地工作，村里却又批给这家一所院子，预备各人退休回来住，现在屋子全空着。来信最后说，我是一名中学生，我所说的全是实话，但我实在没有勇气说出我的姓名，怕给我的家和我带来麻烦。
