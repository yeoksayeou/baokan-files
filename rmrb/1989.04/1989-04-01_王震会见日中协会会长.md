Wang Zhen Meets with Chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 31, Wang Zhen, Vice Chairman of the State, met with the Chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association, Mukou Rokurou, this morning at the Great Hall of the People.

Wang Zhen said that China and Japan should look forward, and people from all walks of life in both countries should do more to promote the development of Sino-Japanese friendly relations.

He pointed out that Sino-Japanese relations are generally good, but there have also been some unpleasant incidents. The Japanese government should acknowledge the historical fact of invading China, which is the key to promoting the development of bilateral relations.
