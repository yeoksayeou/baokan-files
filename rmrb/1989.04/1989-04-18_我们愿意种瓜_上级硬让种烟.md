We Want to Grow Melons, but Higher-Ups Insist on Tobacco

In recent years, our county has encouraged farmers to grow tobacco. However, due to the farmers' lack of technical skills in growing and curing tobacco, the yield and quality were low. Coupled with the purchasing departments' practice of downgrading and underpricing, some farmers ended up not only not making money but actually losing money after a year's hard work. Later, when higher-level departments saw that no one was growing tobacco anymore, they realized that the tobacco purchasing stations set up across the county would become useless. They then resorted to fines to force farmers to grow tobacco. In these few years, a small number of farmers have indeed become rich by growing tobacco, but it is not as good as what the leaders say.

The farmers in our village do not want to grow tobacco because they have found a path to prosperity by growing melons. Now, nearly 500 households in our village are all growing melons. Many farmers have become rich by growing melons. Previously, our village had many bachelors, but now young men have married, built new houses, bought bicycles, and added televisions.

The county encourages growing tobacco, but we have unspeakable grievances and dissatisfaction. Why do the county and township governments insist on making us grow tobacco? We farmers rely on the land to survive. We grow melons, vegetables, and some grain for our own consumption. Where do we have the space to grow tobacco? Moreover, growing melons is much better than growing tobacco. Growing tobacco requires an investment of 100 yuan per mu, with an income of only 400 yuan. If we grow melons, with an investment of 110 yuan, we can earn 1,000 yuan. After harvesting the melons, we can also grow a season of vegetables, earning an additional 500 to 800 yuan per mu. How can we bear to give up melons for "sesame"?

Because some farmers did not grow or grew less tobacco, failing to complete the tasks assigned by higher authorities, the township sent work teams to the village to impose fines. For the matter of growing tobacco, farmers are sure to lose if they sue the government.

Spring has arrived, and it is the time to raise tobacco seedlings. I heard that the county plans to require each person to grow an additional 0.05 mu of tobacco this year, and each mu of tobacco must pre-pay 70 yuan as tax.

### 我们愿意种瓜　上级硬让种烟

　　我们愿意种瓜　上级硬让种烟
    前几年，我县号召农民种烟，由于农民的种烟、烘烤技术跟不上，烟叶产量低、质量差，加上收购部门压级压价，结果，有的农民忙了一年，到头不但不赚钱，反倒赔了。后来，上级部门看到没人种烟了，全县刚建起的大小烟叶收购站就要没用了，便用罚款的方式强迫农民种烟。这几年，是有少部分农民通过种烟脱贫致富了，但不像领导干部讲的那样好。
    我村农民不愿种烟，是因为他们从几户种瓜的农民那里找到了致富的门路。现在我们村近５００多户人家几乎全是种瓜户。不少农民种瓜致富了，以前我村光棍多，现在小伙子娶上了媳妇，盖了新房，买了自行车，添了电视机。
    县里号召种烟，我们有说不出的委屈和不满。县里、乡里为什么硬是逼着我们种烟？我们农民是靠土地生存的。我们种了瓜、种了菜，再种些自己吃的粮食，哪有空地种烟呢？何况我们种瓜比种烟强多了。种烟每亩投资１００元，收入不过４００元。若种瓜，投资１１０元，能收入１０００元，收了瓜，还可种一季菜，每亩又可收入５００元至８００元。我们怎能忍心丢了西瓜去捡“芝麻”呢？
    由于一些农民没有种或少种烟叶，完不成上级下达的任务，乡里就派工作组到村里罚款。为种烟的事，农民与政府打官司，肯定是打不赢的。
    春天到了，正是育烟苗的时节，听说县里今年要每人加种０．０５亩烟田，而且每亩烟田要预交７０元钱作为税金。
