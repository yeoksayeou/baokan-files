In March, Professor Gao Guanhua of the Central Academy of Fine Arts successively held exhibitions of his flower and bird paintings at the Chinese Painting Research Institute and the National Art Museum. This year marks the 50th anniversary of Mr. Gao's career in art education, and it is also the first time since the 1940s that he has held a personal exhibition.

Gao Guanhua was born in 1915 in Nantong, a city known for its commercial prosperity and cultural richness. As a child, he often visited his elder cousin, the renowned Chinese calligrapher and painter Wang Gezai, and was influenced by the arts. Later, he was admitted to the National Art Academy in Hangzhou, where he received guidance and recognition from the great master of Chinese painting, Pan Tianshou. After the founding of the People's Republic, Gao Guanhua taught successively at Tianjin University, Beijing Art Normal College, and the Central Academy of Fine Arts.

Gao Guanhua excels in shaping flowers and capturing the spirit of birds. He draws on the strengths of various masters from the Song and Yuan dynasties, delves into the depths of Qingfeng (Xu Wei), Badashanren (Zhu Da), and Hufulu (Wu Changshuo), and incorporates Western techniques. He has always advocated that "painting should begin with likeness and end with spiritual resemblance, seeming yet not seeming, not seeming yet seeming, to be the highest grade." Therefore, his flower and bird paintings are varied in density and arrangement, with intricate interweaving and innovative compositions. The colors are vibrant, and the rhythm is strong. They possess the spirit of Master Pan while also exhibiting his unique style.

　　高冠华的花鸟画
    3月间，中央美术学院教授高冠华先后在中国画研究院、中国美术馆举办花鸟画展览。今年是高先生从事美术教育事业50周年，也是他从40年代以来第一次举办个人画展。
    高冠华1915年出生在商业发达、人文荟萃的南通市。幼年时，他常常去看表兄、我国著名的书画家王个簃写字作画，受到艺术的熏陶。以后，他考取杭州国立艺专，从此得到国画大师潘天寿先生的教诲与赏识。建国后，高冠华先后在天津大学、北京艺术师范学院、中央美术学院任教。
    高冠华为花造型为鸟传神，上撷宋元诸家之长，下究青藤（徐渭）、八大（朱耷）、缶庐（吴昌硕）之奥，兼习西法。他历来主张“画须始于形似，终于神似，似而不似，不似而似，方为上品”。因此，他的花鸟画疏密聚散，穿插交错多变，构图新异，色彩绚丽，节奏感强烈。既有潘老神韵，又有自家风骨。
