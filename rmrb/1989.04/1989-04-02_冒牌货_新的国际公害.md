Counterfeit goods have flooded the markets of many countries, becoming a prominent international nuisance.

In Paris, France, a high-end shirt with a green crocodile logo is priced at 350 francs, but in some stores, you can buy a counterfeit with the same logo for just 100 francs, or even less. Counterfeit "Pierre Cardin" silk ties, French brand watches, perfumes, clothing, and leather shoes are all prevalent. According to French businesspeople, almost all French brand-name products have counterfeit versions circulating in various places. The market circulation of some counterfeit items is as much as eight times that of the genuine brand-name products. The proliferation of counterfeit goods not only damages the reputation of brand-name products but also causes economic losses of up to 50 billion francs annually for brand-name manufacturers.

Counterfeit goods can be found everywhere in the markets of Europe and America. A United Nations report indicates that counterfeit products now account for 5% of the total global trade volume, causing economic losses of 90 billion francs for various manufacturers. Many counterfeit items, particularly counterfeit drugs and automobile parts, directly threaten people's lives and property.

Over 1,400 enterprises in Western European countries have jointly established the Anti-Counterfeit Action Committee to coordinate efforts and investigate illegal manufacturers, but the results have been minimal. Just like international drug trafficking syndicates, counterfeit products have begun to form international networks for production, transportation, and sales, making them nearly impossible to dismantle. No wonder Western public opinion considers the current proliferation of counterfeit goods to be the second-largest social menace after drug trafficking.

　　冒牌货——新的国际公害
    不少国家的市场上充塞着各式各样的冒牌货，它已成为引人注目的国际公害。
    法国巴黎，一件有绿色鳄鱼商标的名牌高级衬衣，明码表价为３５０法郎，可是在一些店铺里，用１００法郎甚至几十法郎就可以购到有同样商标的冒牌货。“皮尔·卡丹”的名牌丝质领带、法国名牌手表、香水、服装、皮鞋等都有冒牌货。据法国商界人士说，几乎所有法国的名牌产品，都有相同商标的冒牌货在各地流通，不少仿造品的市场流通量竟超过名牌货的８倍。冒牌货泛滥，不仅使名牌产品信誉受损，而且给名牌厂商带来的经济损失每年多达５０亿法郎。
    冒牌货几乎在欧美各国市场上随处可见。联合国一份调查表明，目前，冒牌产品的交易在世界贸易总额中已经占到５％，为各国厂商造成的经济损失达９０００亿法郎。许多冒牌货，尤其是冒牌药品与汽车零件，已直接威胁着人们的生命财产。
    西欧各国１４００多家企业联合成立反冒牌货行动委员会，协调行动，查询不法厂商，但收效甚微。因为，正如国际走私贩毒集团一样，冒牌产品也开始在国际范围内形成了生产、运输、销售的网络，根本难以触动它。怪不得，西方舆论认为，当今冒牌货泛滥已成为仅次于走私贩毒的第二大社会祸害。　      ·石宁·
