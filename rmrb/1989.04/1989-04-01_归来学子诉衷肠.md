A Glimmer of Light in a Mysterious World

There is a mysterious thyroid hormone in the human brain. Newborn infants who lack this hormone will grow up to be mentally impaired. According to a medical survey, one in every 4,000 infants will suffer this fate. The medical community has long been seeking the cause and a solution to prevent this misfortune. However, the unknown world remains as obscure as night.

A bright light finally pierced the darkness. Luo Min, a Chinese student studying for a PhD at the University of Laval in Canada, was the first to invent a monoclonal antibody targeting this hormone receptor. He also used cell immuno-histochemistry to locate the receptor positions in mouse organ cells. His achievements have attracted the attention of the international endocrinology community.

Luo Min's success was expected by his mentors and colleagues. However, what they did not expect was that he would leave behind numerous invitations to stay and job offers for postdoctoral research positions, and return to China like a flash of lightning.

"Working on One's Own Land Feels Secure"

"Have you heard the phrase 'as dumb as a PhD,' which is somewhat popular these days?" When the reporter met Luo Min at the Shanghai Institute of Endocrinology's Monoclonal Antibody Research Laboratory, he asked him this question without hesitation.

The 44-year-old Luo Min casually told me that before and after his return, his overseas classmates and domestic friends had advised and criticized him far beyond the meaning of the word "dumb."

His colleagues said, "You are already well-known in the field of thyroid hormone receptor research. After returning to China, your name will disappear from relevant journals, which is a pity!"

His mentor, Dr. Desautels, is a renowned endocrinologist. Luo Min's achievements made him very excited. He had already secured new research funding for Luo Min, and the conditions for producing results were even better.

Luo Min's resolve to return to China remained steadfast. In November 1988, after his PhD defense, he completed the final details and returned to China within a month.

He told the reporter, "Working on one's own land feels secure."

The Key is Whether You Can Produce Results

He returned, and the Shanghai Institute of Endocrinology allocated 100,000 yuan to purchase a super-clean workbench and a carbon dioxide incubator for his experiments. Luo Min himself also moved into a more spacious new residence. The not-so-rich country did its best to help the returning scholars achieve new successes on their own soil.

Luo Min believes that while working abroad, no matter what achievements are made, it is easy to fall into someone else's research path. As a physiologist and medical worker, returning to China, the working conditions are indeed poor, but there are more cases and a broader range of choices.

Luo Min is most concerned about his current work. He has applied for two National Natural Science Foundation projects. One of them is "Research on Human Breast Estrogen Receptors." He introduced that in North America, one in every 11 women will develop breast cancer; there are 750,000 breast cancer patients in the United States. Breast cancer in Chinese women is the second most common cancer among women and is increasing year by year. For breast cancer patients, ovaries and uteruses are often removed blindly. Luo Min is considering how to improve the treatment of breast cancer. Hormones are produced by the ovaries. If there are hormone receptors, taking anti-hormone drugs can be effective, and there is no need to remove the uterus; if there are no hormone receptors, taking drugs will not help. Those with hormone receptors have a better prognosis after surgery.

Luo Min spoke confidently, his tone steady and unhurried, and what he said were facts that people believed. He is confident about his new research topics but not without worries. Because he will encounter, or has already encountered, the difficulties in life and work that many middle-aged and young intellectuals face. Luo Min is most concerned about starting the new research topics as soon as possible. He hopes to take on graduate students and teach them the latest cutting-edge technologies he has learned. Luo Min said, "Whether one is 'dumb' or not depends on whether one can produce research results." When he said this, his expression was very serious. This was the first time I saw him with such an expression during the interview.

　　归来学子诉衷肠
    本报记者  萧关根
    神秘世界里出现闪光
    人的大脑里有一个神秘的甲状腺激素。刚刚降临人世间的婴儿，若是没有这种激素，长大了就是呆傻人。据一份医学调查说，每４０００个婴儿中会有一个遭此不幸。医学界始终在苦苦探求其中原委，怎样才能使人们免受不幸？但是未知世界始终混沌如夜。
    划破黑暗的闪亮终于出现了，在加拿大拉瓦尔大学医学院攻读博士学位的中国留学生罗敏，第一个发明了针对这种激素受体的单克隆抗体，而且使用细胞免疫化学法对老鼠内脏细胞受体位置进行了定位。他的成就令国际内分泌界瞩目。
    罗敏会取得这样的成就，这是他的导师和同事们意料中的事。把一迭声的挽留和纷纷而来的博士后研究聘书抛在身后，像闪电般地回到中国，却是他周围的人都没有想到的。
    “在自家土地上工作心里踏实”
    “‘傻得像博士’，这句在时下有些风行的话，你听说过吗？”记者在上海内分泌研究所单克隆抗体研究室见罗敏时，不揣冒昧地问他。
    ４４岁的罗敏毫不在意地告诉我，在回国前后，国外同学和国内亲友的规劝、责备，远远超过了“傻”字所能包容的含义。
    同行说，你在甲状腺激素受体研究领域已广为人知，回国后，你的名字将在有关的杂志上消失，多么可惜！
    导师迪索是国际著名的内分泌专家，罗敏的成就使他兴奋不已，他已为罗敏申请到了一笔新的研究经费，出成果的条件就更好了。
    罗敏的归国信念仍然执著。１９８８年１１月，在博士论文答辩后，他把最后的细节修改完毕，就在一个月内整装回国了。
    他告诉记者：“在自家土地上工作心里踏实。”
    关键看你能否出成果
    他回来了，上海内分泌研究所拨出１０万元为他的实验购买了超净工作台和二氧化碳保温箱；罗敏本人也搬进了比较宽敞的新居。并不富裕的国家竭尽力量帮助学成归来的学子早日在自己的土地上作出新的成绩。
    罗敏认为，在国外搞研究，无论取得怎样的成就，容易落在别人的思路里旋转。作为一个生理和医学工作者，回到国内，工作条件确实差，但病例多，有更广阔的选择范围。
    罗敏最关注的还是今天的工作。他已申报了两项自然科学基金。其中一项是“人乳房雌激素受体研究”。他介绍说，在北美每１１个妇女中会有一个患乳房癌；美国有７５万人患乳房癌。中国妇女的乳房癌已占妇女肿瘤的第２位，并且有逐年上升的趋势。对患乳房癌的病人，常常盲目地将卵巢和子宫切除。罗敏考虑的是如何改进对乳房癌的治疗问题。激素是由卵巢产生的。如果有激素受体，吃抗激素的药就能发生作用，不必切除子宫；没有激素受体，吃药也没有用。有激素受体的开刀愈后较好。
    罗敏侃侃而谈，语气平稳，调子不高，他说的都是令人相信的事实。对于新的研究课题他是有信心的，但并非毫无忧虑。因为一般中青年知识分子生活和工作上的困难，他都会遇到，或者已经遇到了。罗敏最关心的是早点开始新课题的研究。他希望带研究生，把自己学到的最新尖端技术教给别人。罗敏说：“傻不傻就看能否出研究成果。”说这句话时，他的表情是很严肃的。我在访问中第一次看到他这样的表情。
