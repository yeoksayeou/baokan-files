Planting Trees Together to Green Our Motherland
Hundreds of Thousands of Beijing Military and Civilians Plant Trees
Party and State Leaders and Some NPC Deputies Participate

BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) — Today is the fifth Tree-Planting Day in the capital. Over 1.6 million military personnel and civilians from Beijing city and countryside stepped out of their barracks and homes to participate in tree-planting activities along streets, in institutional courtyards, and on barren hills in the suburbs.

Today's tree-planting activities in Beijing were grand in scale, with the highest number of participants ever. At 8:30 AM, along the roads from Tuanjie Lake Park to the Agricultural Exhibition Hall and Dabeiying, more than 5,000 Young Pioneers planted friendship trees under the theme "Let Green Connect You and Me." At Xiannongtan Stadium, over a thousand athletes planted "trees for national glory."

Planting trees and afforestation is a duty for every eligible citizen. In this activity, whether they were young students, state officials, ordinary citizens, or central leaders, everyone picked up tools to plant trees and afforest. Sixty representatives from the Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, and Zhejiang delegations attending the National People's Congress participated in tree-planting at the Shijingshan Gymnasium along with the people of Beijing.

According to statistics, the party and state leaders, central ministers, and military officers above the division level who participated in today's tree-planting activities numbered over 200. Together with the people of Beijing, they planted over 2 million trees, including over 20,000 commemorative trees, moved over 100,000 cubic meters of soil, tended over 2 million trees, and cleaned over 1 million square meters of green spaces.

BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) — At around 9:50 AM today, party and state leaders Zhao Ziyang, Deng Xiaoping, Yang Shangkun, Li Peng, Wan Li, and others successively came to the construction site of the Asian Games Village to cultivate soil and water for over 140 cypress, white pine, ginkgo, and pine trees. A new patch of green appeared on the bustling construction site of the Asian Games Village.

Deng Xiaoping is the initiator of voluntary tree-planting. Today is his 10th time participating in Beijing's tree-planting activities. He enthusiastically held his granddaughter Yang Yang with one hand and his grandson Xiaodi with the other, walking steadily to a white pine tree and shoveling soil under it carefully. The deputy director of the Beijing Greening Committee, Shanzhao Xiang, told Deng Xiaoping, "The trees you planted in the Ming Tombs have grown tall and big." Deng Xiaoping nodded happily and said, "Our first tree-planting was on Yuquanshan." He hoped that China's tree-planting and afforestation cause would be passed down from generation to generation.

Wearing a light gray jacket, Zhao Ziyang looked particularly spirited today. He planted trees with Qiao Shi, Hu Qili, Yao Yilin, Wang Zhen, and other comrades. After planting one tree, he encouraged everyone, "Let's plant another one." Then he planted a second tree.

As in previous years, Yang Shangkun brought his granddaughter to plant trees with him. While looking at the green space planning of the Asian Games Village, he told reporters, "Now, illegal logging is very serious. Planting while cutting down is wrong. Those who lead in destroying forests should be severely punished by law."

After planting three trees, Li Peng had beads of sweat on his forehead, but he insisted, "Let's do one more," and planted the fourth tree.

Other leaders participating in the tree-planting at the Asian Games Village today included Tian Jiyun, Li Tieying, Li Ximing, Wu Xueqian, Qin Jinguang, Ding Guangen, Song Renqiong, Yan Mingfu, Wen Jiabao, and Chen Xitong.

As he left, Wan Li said meaningfully to the comrades of Beijing, "You need to work harder and even harder on greening!"

April 2 morning was sunny and warm. Party and state leaders joined the military and civilians of Beijing in the voluntary tree-planting activities.

　　绿化祖国同尽义务
    首都百余万军民植树
    党和国家领导人以及部分人大代表参加
    本报北京４月２日讯  记者高保生报道：今天，是首都第５个义务植树日。北京城乡１６０万军民走出营房和家门，来到街道两侧、机关庭院和郊野荒山，参加义务植树。
    今天北京的义务植树活动，规模宏大，是历年参加人数最多的一次。上午８时３０分，在团结湖公园至农展馆、大北窑的公路两侧，有５０００多名少先队员以“让绿色连接你和我”为主题，植下了友谊成材树。在先农坛体育场，千余名体育健儿植下了“为国争光树”。
    植树造林，是每个适龄公民应尽的义务。在这一活动中，无论是青年学生，还是国家干部；无论是普通老百姓，还是中央领导同志，纷纷拿起工具植树造林。出席全国人大的四川、内蒙古和浙江三个代表团的６０名代表，在石景山体育馆，同首都人民一起参加植树。
    据统计，参加今天植树的党和国家领导人、中央部长级和驻京军级以上干部达２００多名。他们和首都人民一起，共植树２００多万株，其中栽植各种纪念树２万多株，动土方１０万多立方米，养护树木２００万株，清扫绿地１００多万平方米。
    本报北京４月２日讯　记者高保生报道：今天上午９时５０分左右，党和国家领导人赵紫阳、邓小平、杨尚昆、李鹏、万里等相继来到亚运村建设工地，为１４０多棵桧柏、白皮松、银杏和油松培土、浇水。繁忙的亚运村工地上出现了一片新的绿色。
    邓小平同志是义务植树的倡导者，今天已是第１０次参加北京植树劳动了。他兴致勃勃地一手拉着外孙女羊羊，一手拉着小孙子小弟，步履稳健地走到一棵白皮松前，一铲一铲认真地给树培土。首都绿化委员会副主任单昭祥告诉邓小平：“您当年在十三陵栽的树已经长高了、长大了。”邓小平高兴地点点头，说：“我们第一次栽树是在玉泉山。”他希望我国的植树造林事业要一代一代传下去。
    身着浅灰色夹克衫的赵紫阳，今天显得格外精神。他同乔石、胡启立、姚依林、王震等同志在一起植树。当种完一棵后，他动员人们“再种一棵吧”。接着又栽了第二棵树。
    与往年一样，杨尚昆又带着他的小孙女一同植树。他一边望着亚运村绿地规划地形，一面对记者说：“现在乱砍滥伐很厉害。一边栽一边乱砍是不对的。对带头毁林者要依法严惩。”
    李鹏接连种了３棵树后，额头上已渗出细细的汗珠，但他坚持“再来一棵”，又种下了第４棵树。
    参加今天亚运村植树的还有田纪云、李铁映、李锡铭、吴学谦、秦基伟、丁关根、宋任穷、阎明复、温家宝、陈希同等领导同志。
    临走时，万里意味深长地对北京市的同志说：“你们的绿化还要加油、再加油！”
