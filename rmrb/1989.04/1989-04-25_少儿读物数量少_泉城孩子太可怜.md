Edition: 6

Currently, bookstores and bookstalls across our city have a shortage of children's literature. Unfortunately, children, due to the lack of suitable books, are forced to read adult books that they cannot fully understand. According to statistics from the municipal book distribution department, the number of children's books purchased and transferred into the city in 1988 decreased by 690,000 copies compared to 1987, a reduction of 57.9%. The sales volume of children's literature decreased by 20%, and the inventory decreased by 83%. Due to the scarcity of children's literature, the limited variety, and outdated content, the market for children's literature is quite sluggish.

　　少儿读物数量少  泉城孩子太可怜
    目前，我市各处的书店、书摊的少儿读物少，可怜的孩子们由于缺少适合自己看的书，只好看一些看不懂的大人书。据市图书发行部门统计，一九八八年全市购入、调进的少儿读物比一九八七年减少六十九万册，减少了百分之五十七点九，少儿读物销售量减少了百分之二十，库存量下降百分之八十三。由于少儿读物数量少，品种单一，内容陈旧，少儿读物市场十分冷落。
