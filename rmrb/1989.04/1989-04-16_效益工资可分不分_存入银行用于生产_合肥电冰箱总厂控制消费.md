Recently, the Hefei Refrigerator Factory, which has rapidly risen to prominence in the past two years, has not forgotten the spirit of hard work and thrift despite its newfound wealth. The factory has voluntarily deposited 24 million yuan of surplus performance-based wages into the bank.

Originally, the Hefei Refrigerator Factory was a struggling enterprise that often had to borrow money to pay wages. Since the reform and opening up, the factory has excelled in competition by producing high-quality products, becoming a wealthy enterprise with an annual output value exceeding 100 million yuan and tax revenues surpassing 10 million yuan. With the approval of the Hefei Municipal Government, the factory has implemented a system since last year where the total wage amount is linked to economic performance. Specifically, for every 1% increase in economic performance, the total wage amount can increase by 0.3%.

According to the contract, the factory has allocated 50 million yuan in performance-based wage funds for last year and the first quarter of this year. The factory leadership believes that although the factory has the right to distribute these funds, controlling the rapid growth of consumption demand is a current priority. Every unit should voluntarily comply with this. Therefore, they decided to use more of the funds for production development. They explained the reasoning to the employees, helping everyone to enhance their sense of responsibility in sharing the nation's burdens, and everyone agreed to deposit the surplus performance-based wages into the bank.

Recently, Hefei City conducted a financial and tax inspection, and the Hefei Refrigerator Factory was listed as an exempt unit.

　　效益工资可分不分　存入银行用于生产
　　合肥电冰箱总厂控制消费
    新华社合肥４月１５日电　（《安徽日报》记者温琪、新华社记者陈宝善）最近两年陡然发起来的合肥电冰箱总厂富裕不忘艰苦奋斗，自觉把节余的２４０多万元效益工资全部存入银行。
    合肥电冰箱总厂原是个穷得叮当响的企业，常靠借贷发工资。改革开放以来，这个厂在竞争中凭优良的产品质量取胜，一举成为年产值突破亿元、税利超过千万元的富裕户。经合肥市政府批准，这个厂从去年起实行工资总额同经济效益挂钩的办法，即经济效益增加１％，工资总额可增加０．３％。
    按照承包合同规定，去年和今年第一季度，全厂提取了效益工资基金５００万元。厂领导认为，这些钱工厂虽有权分配，但控制消费需求过快增长是当前的大局，任何单位都应自觉服从，因此决定把更多的资金用于发展生产。他们向职工讲清了道理，使大家增强了为国家分忧的责任感，都赞成节余的效益工资全部存入银行。
    最近合肥市开展财务税收大检查，合肥电冰箱总厂被列为免检单位。
