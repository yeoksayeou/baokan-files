The Eastern Flowing Water Passes Through Ithaca
— In Memory of Teacher Xie Dike

Ithaca, a small city in the eastern United States, was originally named Ithaca. The translation is exquisite, both in sound and form, as if the city's lakes and mountains, as well as its people's faces and laughter, are all captured. It seems like it was translated by Xu Zhimo or Xie Bingxin, but I don't have a book to verify it.

I can't forget it, simply because half a century ago, during my time studying at Yenching University, I had a British literature teacher named Xie Dike, who now lives, teaches, and has retired but not hidden himself in this place. This is the location of a famous American university, Cornell.

I entered Yenching University in 1938, and I knew the name Xie Dike as early as the end of 1936. At that time, the young Xiao Qian, in the literary supplement of the *Dagongbao* newspaper he edited, published a three-page discussion on Cao Yu's *Sunrise*. Participants in this unprecedented discussion on a play included Mao Dun, Ye Shengtao, Zhu Guangqian, Shen Congwen, Ba Jin, and young Li Guangtian, Jin Yi, Huangmo, Yang Gang. Among them was a foreign professor, Xie Dike. He commented that *Sunrise* "can stand proudly alongside the works of Ibsen and Galsworthy." It was also in 1936 that Lu Xun passed away, and Xie Dike published a memorial article in the student publication of Yenching University, which I recently saw. He said of Lu Xun, "He expressed the highest social and political thoughts for people; he himself is a perfect model of a teacher and leader." He also described, "He grew a beard, seemingly to hide his kindness and benevolence." Obviously, Xie Dike was an early foreigner who understood both Chinese literature and China.

My regret is that I did not have the chance to know him better. In the fall of 1938, I entered the Department of Western Languages at Yenching University, and he was the department head. He had the demeanor of a British gentleman and spoke standard London English, which were what we young students aspired to. At that time, students also had this saying: Xie Dike's three treasures are his wife, cane, and a dog. Xie Dike's wife was a Russian woman who taught Russian literature at the same university. I took Xie Dike's course "Eighteenth-Century British Literature." Looking back, sitting in the classroom listening to such a professor lecturing on Defoe or Burns was truly a blessing. However, young people often do not appreciate the blessings they have. I was careless in my studies, my mind often on acting and love; what made me even more restless was that it was the time of the Anti-Japanese War. Facing the peaceful waters of Weiming Lake, I always felt guilty, and eventually, I left, wandering to the ends of the earth, far from Defoe, Burns, and Xie Dike. Half a century has passed.

It was not until the end of the Cultural Revolution in China that I was invited to visit the United States several times, and I finally got in touch with my teacher. Teacher Xie often invited me to stay in Ithaca for a while, but I was always in a hurry and could not fulfill the wish. It was not until the summer of 1986 that I went to the United States to teach and would stay for more than a year. It seemed like there would be an opportunity, but he was then invited to China, which was his first visit back to China after forty years. At that time, the Pacific War had started, and Japanese soldiers had entered the campus. He was lecturing on *Romeo and Juliet*, and the class was interrupted at the "last lesson." Forty years later, he lectured on *Romeo and Juliet* again in the same classroom at the former Yenching University, now Peking University, for new and old students. The fifth generation of Chinese students at Cornell, the young playwright Yan Haiping, wrote a beautiful essay *The Red Leaves of Yenching* for his visit to China.

Another year passed, in the fall of 1987, the red leaves in the eastern United States were at their best. Before I returned to China, I was invited to give a lecture on Chinese opera and drama at Cornell University. This was when I had the chance to stay with my teacher and his wife, Ruo Shan, for three days and nights. Teacher Xie had just turned 85, and his wife had been ill for many years and passed away three years ago. The old man lived alone, and students took turns helping with gardening or cooking. The arrival of guests added some liveliness. This kind of lively solitude seemed to be quite common.

For an old scholar, perhaps the most solitary and lively place is in his study, bookshelves, and desk. Here and there were his long-studied *Wenxin Diaolong*, his English translation of *Lao Can Youji*, his edited five-volume *Introduction to Chinese Literature*, selected works from the Pre-Qin philosophers to Liang Qichao, Wang Guowei, Hu Shi, Lu Xun, and academic works on ancient Chinese vocabulary and classical Chinese grammar. These are still the highest-level Chinese studies teaching materials in the United States. There are also the series of *Chinese Singing Arts* that he continued to oversee after retirement. Gifts of books, paintings, and poems are everywhere. Gu Ran, Wu Wenchao, Xie Bingxin... old friends' works, disciple Wang Shixiang's work on Ming Dynasty furniture, and even my small collection of essays *The Family of Performers*, etc. (According to his recent letter, there are also new works by guests Bei Dao and Liu Binyan added.) What touched me the most was that the teacher took out a stack of yellowed old grade sheets. The names of Xiao Qian and Wang Rumei (later the diplomat Huang Hua) were prominently listed, and their grades were at the top; mine was lower, which is also something I cannot be ashamed of. What is most precious is that these grade sheets, preserved for more than half a century, contain so much of the teacher's affection!

For three days, in the morning and evening, my wife and I often sat under the eastern bamboo curtain of the teacher's house, looking at the stream flowing by the side house, murmuring from above to below, forming several layers of small waterfalls. At night, it still murmured softly. I said to my wife, how is all this like the scenery in a Chinese landscape painting? I think that the natural world of the homeland and abroad is similar, and when it is colored by human, subjective, and emotional hues, it also evokes endless homesickness. The flowing water of Ithaca in my heart produces an indescribable symbol.

These three days of staying were like the stream in the valley, flowing with sound and without sound. We talked about heaven and earth, talked about literature and art, and talked like the flowing water, not knowing where it began or ended. We practiced Tai Chi together; he was much better than me, with the standard 108 forms of Yang style. We walked together in the green fields; I wore his hat and leaned on his cane, which was more for decoration, and posed as a British gentleman; he laughed and talked about the three treasures of the past, and I was not supposed to point out that only the cane remained. People are used to using a faint smile and faint forgetfulness to lightly cover the deep sadness that has soaked in. One day, while driving, I mentioned some old friends, and I blurted out, "Half of my peers are ghosts!" The teacher didn't hear it clearly at first, and Ruo Shan wanted me to translate it into English, but I looked around and talked about something else.

The room that had lost its mistress was still kept very clean. But Ruo Shan was a woman after all, and before leaving, she quietly wiped all the stoves and utensils in the kitchen. She also noticed an old-fashioned small piano in the corner of the hall, which seemed to have been untouched for a long time. My wife imagined that it was often played by the late Mrs. Xie, and she also wiped it lightly. I told Ruo Shan: In school, Xie Dike's solo in the "Messiah" chorus was particularly outstanding.

Three days passed, and finally, we said goodbye. The teacher drove us to the Greyhound bus station in England, put us on the bus, and hugged us goodbye. The teacher got off the bus, and we saw him pacing in the fine rain, as if looking for something. But he walked back to the bus, saying that he thought he could see us through the window, but the gray haze made it unclear, so he got on the bus again and said goodbye once more.

Farewell, it is easy to part, but hard to meet again. The teacher is nearly ninety, and we are also nearly seventy. So, I often miss the stream under his eaves that never stops. Another year has passed, more than a year, and news comes across the ocean. The teacher often sends a detailed printed long letter to all friends, followed by a few special greetings. This time, the first page of the double-sided print is about his experiences in 1987 and 1988, including our visit. On the second page, however, there was a surprising appearance of new people and new things. I tried to translate a few lines:

"In late March, I went to San Francisco for a meeting, and in the interval, I met an old friend H.M. in the park and was invited to have a regular Saturday family dinner with his three sons and their families. The next day, I flew to San Diego to visit a friend. Fortunately, there was a phone in the guest room, and I couldn't help but call H.M. again the next evening; the next morning, when I said goodbye, I was able to thank the host and hostess and their phone number, as a wedding was being planned. H.M. was my student at Yenching University, and after graduation, he was an assistant in the music department and accompanied me in the 'Messiah' singing. In 1947, she came to Cornell as a graduate student in English literature and assisted me in teaching Chinese classical literature and writing textbooks for six years. I lost my Nellie in 1984, and she lost her Sohn in the previous spring. At this time, we two are matched for the third time. On the seventh day of July, we accepted the certification and became husband and wife, with his three sons and their families, a total of 16 people, attending the wedding banquet..."

He listed a series of names of people who gathered in various places and the travel schedule until the trip to his hometown in England the following year and the trip to his mother-in-law's home in China the year after that... My wife and I wanted to send a congratulatory letter, but we didn't know where to send it for a while.

I checked the class directory and asked old classmates, and only roughly knew that H.M.'s Chinese name is Wu Qinming, class number 28, ten years earlier than my class number of 1938. Her classmate Zhao Luorui, who was in the same class, laughed loudly on the phone and said to me, "They are really a great partnership, very similar, both so full of vitality..."

I suddenly felt that I had many, many places to learn from my teacher, first of all, being "full of vitality"...

I still miss the flowing water of Ithaca, where does the water come from? Perhaps from the sky, perhaps from the east...

My teacher Xie Dike wrote: "H.M. plays the piano every morning and evening, and our old piano resonates better than expected..."

As the writing is about to end, a friend who was also a "little reader" at that time told me that I was looking for the origin of the translation of "Ithaca" and sent me a copy of Xie Bingxin's *Letters to Little Readers* from 1924, which said: "It's Ithaca again. Ithaca is so beautiful! The beauty lies in its depth. It is like a recluse, like autumn, like chrysanthemums. It is close to the spring, the first time in my life, very novel! Walking in the woods, everywhere by the deep ravine, listening to the sound of the spring in my dreams!..."

How did Xie Bingxin feel the same as I did half a century ago? That is natural. The young Xie Bingxin also quoted a poem: "All feelings follow the flowing water..."

　　东方流水流经绮色佳
　　——寄怀谢迪克老师
　　黄宗江
    绮色佳，是美国东部的一个小城，原名Ｉｔｈａｃａ，译做绮色佳，译得绝妙，音准形肖，这小城的湖光山色、音容笑貌似乎都具现了。好像是徐志摩或谢冰心这样译的，手边无书可查。
    我念念不忘它，只是因为半个世纪以前，我在燕京大学上学时期的一位英国文学教师谢迪克，如今生活、授业、退而未隐于斯。这里是美国的一所著名大学康奈尔所在地。
    我是１９３８年上燕大的，我知道谢迪克这个名字则早在１９３６年底，那时候年轻的萧乾在他主编的《大公报》文艺副刊上，以三整版的篇幅，发表了关于曹禺《日出》的笔谈，参加这次史无前例的对于一部剧作笔谈的名家有茅盾、叶圣陶、朱光潜、沈从文、巴金诸位，还有青年李广田、靳以、荒煤、杨刚……此中出现了一位外国教授就是谢迪克。他评说《日出》“可以毫无愧色地与易卜生、高尔斯华绥的杰作并肩而立。”也是１９３６年，鲁迅逝世，谢迪克在燕京的学生刊物上发表过纪念文章，却是我最近才见到的。他说鲁迅“他为人们表达了最高的社会和政治思想；他本人是一位教师和领导者的完美典型。”并描绘说“他留了胡须，似乎想借此掩住他的仁慈和善良”。显然，谢迪克很早就是一位不但了解中国文学，也了解中国的洋人。
    我自己遗憾的是当年未能更深的了解他。１９３８年秋季，我进了燕京大学西语系，他是系主任。他一派英国绅士的派头，一口标准伦敦英语，这都是我们年轻学子所向往的。当时学生们还有这么个说法：谢迪克随身三件宝：夫人、手杖、狗一条。谢迪克夫人是在同一大学讲授俄罗斯文学的一位俄罗斯小妇人。我那时选了谢迪克的课“十八世纪英国文学”。回首前尘，坐在课堂里听这样的教授讲解笛福或彭斯，真是一种福。然而年轻人常是身在福中不知福的，我漫不经心，学业荒疏，心多放在演剧和爱情上；尤其不安心的是当时正是抗日战争，面对宁静的未名湖水总感到十分有愧，终于一步步远走，远去海角天涯，远离了笛福、彭斯，也远离了谢迪克，半个世纪迈过去了。
    还是中国的“文化大革命”结束，我数次应邀访问美国，才和老师联系上了。谢师多次邀我赴他所在绮色佳小住，总是行色匆匆，未能如愿。直到１９８６年夏，我赴美讲学，要勾留一载有余，看来有机会了，但他此时又应邀到中国去了，这是他告别中国四十载后的重访。当年，太平洋战争起，日本兵进入校园，他正在讲授《罗密欧与朱丽叶》，中断在这“最后一课”。４０年后，他又在昔日燕大、今日北大的大课堂上，为新老学生重讲了《罗密欧与朱丽叶》。康奈尔的第五代中国留学生，年轻的剧作家颜海平为他此去中国专写了一篇美丽的《燕园的红叶》。
    又是一年，１９８７年秋，美东的红叶正好，我返国前夕，应邀赴康奈尔大学做一次关于中国戏曲与戏剧的讲演，乃得携妻若珊在谢师家小住三日夜。谢师不久前刚度过８５岁生日，师母卧病多年已于三年前故去。老人独处，时有学生轮值，或助园艺或助烹饪。过客的到来凭添了些热闹。这种孤寂中的热闹看来也还是常有的。
    对于一个老学者，也许最孤寂又是最热闹的所在，就在他的书斋、书架和书案吧。这里那里，是他研究了多年的《文心雕龙》、他英译的《老残游记》、他编辑的五大卷《中国文学入门》，选辑的作品从先秦诸子直到梁启超、王国维、胡适、鲁迅，还有关于古汉语词汇以及文言语法的学术著作，这些至今仍是美国最高水准的汉学教材。还有他退休后仍在主持的《中国演唱艺术》丛刊。赠书赠画赠诗更触目皆是。顾随、吴文藻、谢冰心……往昔同人的旧作，弟子王世襄关于明朝家具的论著，以至我的散文小册《卖艺人家》等等。（据其近日来信，当更添过客北岛和刘宾雁见赠的新作了。）最触动我的是老师捧出了一摞纸已发黄的旧日分数单。萧乾和王汝梅（即日后的外交家黄华）他们的名字都赫然在焉，且分数均列前茅；我则偏低，这也是无从愧对的事了。无比可贵的是这些保存了半个世纪以上的分数单饱含了几多夫子之情！
    三日来，清晨日暮，我和若珊时常坐在谢家悬着东方竹帘的红漆檐下，望着傍屋流过的山涧流水，潺潺自上而下，形成了好几阶层的小小瀑布，入夜也仍在淙淙细语。我对妻说怎么这一切尤似中国山水画的意境呢？想来这世上本土和异国的大自然本就是相似乃尔的，再沾染了人文的、主观的、感情的色彩，也就引发出乡情无限，这绮色佳的流水在我心中产生了一种一言难尽的象征。
    这三天驻足也像山涧流水似地有声又似无声地流去。我们谈天说地，谈文说艺，也像流水般不知所起所终。我们一起打太极拳，他比我强多了，是正规的杨家一百零八式。我们一起漫步绿茵，我戴上了他的帽子，拄了他的仍以装饰为主的手杖，做英国绅士状；他笑谈起当年三宝，我又岂宜点破如今惟余一杖了。人们习于用淡笑淡忘来轻掩深深浸润的惆怅。一日行车中，偶提起一些故人，我脱口而出：“朋辈半为鬼！”谢师一时没听清，若珊要我再做英译，我却旁顾左右而言它了。
    这失去了主妇的居室仍然保持得十分整洁。但若珊到底是女人，行前仍悄悄把厨房里所有的炉灶和器皿都擦拭了一遍。她还注意到堂屋角落里一架形象古老的小钢琴，似乎久已无人拂拭。我妻子想象那是已故谢夫人经常弹奏的，也把它轻拭了一遍。我告诉若珊：当年在学校举行“弥赛亚”合唱中谢迪克的独唱是分外出色的。
    三天过去了，终于告别。老师驾车把我们送到英国的“灰犬”长途车站，把我们送上车去，拥抱而别。老师下车，我们只见他在细雨中仍在踱步，像是在寻觅什么。但是他又走上车来，说是原以为隔窗还能看到我们，不意灰蒙蒙的看不清了，乃又上车来，又告别一次。
    别了，别时容易见时难，老师年近九旬，我们也年近七旬了，于是我时常怀念他檐下不息的溪流。又是一年，一年多了，音息隔洋传来。谢师常是寄一封公告所有亲友的叙述甚详的打印的长信，其后再附几笔各自不同的特殊的问候。此次，两面打印的头一页张是叙述他１９８７与１９８８年的经历，甚至包括我们的来访。第二页张，却令人喜出望外地出现了新人新事，我试摘译于下：
    “三月底余赴会旧金山，间隙约晤老友Ｈ·Ｍ于公园，又蒙邀与其三子并各携全家共进例行的星期六家庭晚餐。次日我飞圣地亚哥访友。幸主人于客房中置有电话，余不禁与Ｈ·Ｍ通话，次晚又通；翌晨告别时乃得答谢主人主妇并其电话，盖一婚事已在蕴酿中。Ｈ·Ｍ是我在燕京大学时的学生，毕业后任音乐系助教，曾在“弥赛亚”歌唱中为我做钢琴伴奏。１９４７年她来康奈尔为英国文学研究生，又助我教授中国古典文学并编写教科书凡六载。我于１９８４年失去我的Ｎｅｌｌｉｅ，她于前春失去她的Ｓｏｈｎ。此时此际合我二人第三次互为配搭。七月七夕日，我们接受公证，成为夫妇，其三子均携全家共１６人参与婚宴……”他开列了随后一系列各地欢聚的人名，并旅游日程，直到明年度的英格兰故乡之游，后年的中国娘家之行……我夫妇想要追寄一封贺简，也一时不知寄往何方为好了。
    我翻查同学录，并打听老学长们，才约略得知Ｈ·Ｍ华名吴沁明，学号２８年级，比我这１９３８学号的早十年。她的同年级密友赵萝蕤大姐在电话里笑声朗朗地对我说：“他们俩真是太好的Ｐａｒｔｎｅｒｓｈｉｐ（配搭），非常相象，都那么Ｆｕｌｌｏｆｖｉｔａｌｉｔｙ（充满活力）……”
    我顿感到我还有很多很多地方要向我的老师学习，首先是“充满活力”……尤怀绮色佳的流水常流，水自何来？或自天上，或自东方……我师谢迪克书云：“Ｈ·Ｍ朝夕抚琴，我们的老牌Ｅｖｅｒｅｔｔ钢琴回响尤佳于预期……”
    行文将毕，得一知交亦当年“小读者”，知我在觅“绮色佳”译名出处，寄我复印１９２４年冰心《寄小读者》一节，曰：“又到了绮色佳（Ｉｔｈａｃａ）。绮色佳真美！美处在深幽。喻人如隐士，喻季候如秋，喻花如菊。与泉相近，是生平第一次，新颖得很！林中行来，处处傍深涧，睡梦里也听着泉声！……”
    怎么冰心大姐在半个多世纪以前就跟我所感一样呢？那也是自然的。年轻的冰心又引诗云：“百感都随流水去……”
