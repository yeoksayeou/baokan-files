The following are excerpts from group speeches at the 7th National People's Congress, 2nd Session:

Guangxi delegate Liu Zhibin said:

    The rectification and austerity drive should not be a "one-size-fits-all" approach.
    It is necessary to focus on the rectification and austerity drive, but we should not overemphasize the issues of inflation and price increases, then apply the brakes abruptly, as this could lead to a crash. I am concerned that the central leadership may view the existing problems too seriously and adopt a "one-size-fits-all" approach in the rectification and austerity drive. For example, some enterprises that can produce and have marketable products may be unable to continue production due to insufficient funds when the state imposes restrictions. If production stops, where will the fiscal revenue come from? The rectification and austerity drive should also address the development of the economy in ethnic minority regions, and it should not be a "one-size-fits-all" approach. Guangxi has been at war for many years, with limited investment in energy, transportation, and basic construction, and a late start in economic development. If a "one-size-fits-all" approach is adopted, we will not be able to cope. Our construction projects have been reduced by half this year, and it will be difficult to get by! I hope the State Council will consider the overall situation and provide policy and financial support to Guangxi.

PLA delegates Zheng Guozhong and Liu Lunxian said:

    The enforcement team needs to be strengthened.
    Currently, the quality of law enforcement personnel, especially at the grassroots level, is poor. Some law enforcement officers commit crimes while enforcing the law, accepting bribes during the process, resulting in unfair trials and emboldening criminals. In the past, people praised Judge Bao because he was strict in enforcing the law, and he dared to behead even royal relatives if they committed a crime. Now, some law enforcement officers use fines as a substitute for punishment; some leaders use words instead of law and power instead of law, interfering with the judicial organs' handling of cases, and damaging the seriousness of the law. The enforcement team needs to be strengthened, and the quality of law enforcement personnel needs to be improved.

Xinjiang delegate Saifuding Aizizi said:

    Religious work must not be relaxed.
    Currently, some places have an overconcentration of religious atmosphere, while the propaganda of Marxism-Leninism is insufficient. Some party members have the party constitution in one pocket and the Quran in the other, and some branch secretaries even became imams. Religious work must not be relaxed at any time, as this is a matter of principle regarding whether to build socialism or feudalism. The publication of religious literary works must have clear viewpoints, clarifying what to advocate and what to promote.

Jilin delegate Guan Shanhong said:

    Suggest simplifying National Day celebrations.
    The activities to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation should be simplified, and the lessons from the 35th anniversary grand celebration that caused internal harm must be learned. In terms of propaganda, more attention should be given to the advanced deeds of the masses, and less to the activities of leaders.

Jiangxi delegate Yang Xilin said:

    The root cause of public security issues must be addressed.
    Public security issues are becoming more serious each year. We have used all the available remedies, but the current remedies cannot control the "disease," and there is no new "miracle cure." The public security issue will become more serious. The problem must be solved in a practical way.

Shaanxi delegate Xie Huai said:

    Leaders and the masses should tighten their belts together.
    During the war years, one of the important reasons we won was that we had a spirit of hard work and perseverance. The same spirit should be promoted during the rectification and austerity drive. Now, some leading cadres talk about hard work and perseverance for others to hear, which is not acceptable. Everyone should tighten their belts, especially leading cadres who should set an example.

Shanghai delegate Ye Shuhua said:

    The lessons of policy mistakes should be seriously reflected upon.
    The lessons of policy mistakes are worth reflecting upon, such as the past lack of clarity about our own situation, leading to the slogan of "catching up with Britain in 15 years." Furthermore, are the figures reported at each level reliable? One moment it is said that there is too much grain and it cannot be eaten, and half a year later it is said that there is not enough grain; one moment it is said that there is too much foreign exchange and it should be used quickly, and soon it is said that foreign exchange is tight; for a period, it is said that there is too much pork and it cannot be eaten, and soon it is said that there is not enough pork. Some of our economic policies have hit the national industry, hit large and medium-sized enterprises, hit regions with high economic efficiency, and caused great losses. If we do not reflect, the economic strength of our country will be seriously affected again.

### 全国人大七届二次会议小组发言摘编

　　全国人大七届二次会议小组发言摘编
    广西代表刘知炳说：
    治理整顿勿搞“一刀切”
    一心一意进行治理整顿是需要的，但我们不能把出现的通货膨胀、物价上涨看得过于严重，然后来个急刹车，急刹车会翻车的。我担心中央领导对存在的问题看得过重，在治理整顿中搞“一刀切”。如有的企业本来可以生产，产品也适销，但国家一压，资金不足，无法保证生产。生产停滞，财政收入从何而来？治理整顿还要处理好发展少数民族地区经济问题，也不能“一刀切”。广西边境多年打仗，能源、交通、基本建设投资少，经济起步晚，底子薄，如果“一刀切”，我们吃不消。我们的基建今年减少一半，日子不好过啊！希望国务院通盘考虑，对广西在政策、资金上给予照顾。
    解放军代表郑国忠、刘伦贤说：
    要加强执法队伍建设
    现在执法人员尤其是基层执法人员素质太差，有的执法犯法，在执法过程中收受贿赂，结果是办案不公，助长了犯罪分子的气焰。过去人们赞扬包公，就是因为他执法严，只要犯了罪，皇亲国戚也敢铡。现在，有些执法人员以罚代刑；还有的领导以言代法、以权代法，干扰司法机关办案，损害了法律的严肃性。要加强执法队伍的建设，提高执法人员的素质。
    新疆代表赛福鼎·艾则孜说：
    不可放松宗教工作
    目前，一些地方宗教气氛过浓，而马列主义的宣传不够。有的党员这个口袋装的是党章，那个口袋装的是古兰经，有的支部书记甚至当了依麻木。宗教工作任何时候都不能放松，这是关系到搞社会主义还是搞封建主义的原则问题。出版宗教文学作品，观点一定要鲜明，要弄清主张什么，提倡什么。
    吉林代表关山复说：
    建议国庆活动从简
    庆祝建国４０周年的活动，建议从简，千万要吸取建国３５周年大庆造成内伤的教训。在宣传方面，多宣传一些群众先进事迹，少宣传一些领导人的活动。
    江西代表杨希林说：
    治安问题要治本
    治安问题一年比一年严重，我们能用的药方都用了，现有的药方控制不了“病情”，又没有新的“特效药”，治安问题将会更严重。解决问题要来实的。
    陕西代表谢怀德说：
    干群一起过紧日子
    战争年代，我们能够打胜仗的重要原因之一，就是有一种艰苦奋斗的精神，搞治理整顿也要提倡延安精神。现在一些领导干部讲艰苦奋斗是给别人听的，这样不行。要大家一起过紧日子，特别是领导干部要以身作则。
    上海代表叶叔华说：
    认真吸取决策失误的教训
    决策失误的教训值得反思，如过去对自己家底没弄清楚，就提出“１５年赶超英国”的口号。再说，逐级上报的数字可靠吗？一会儿说粮食太多吃不掉，半年后又讲粮食不够吃；一会儿说外汇太多要快用，很快又说外汇紧张；有一段说猪肉太多吃不了，不久又说猪肉不够吃。我们的一些经济政策，打击了民族工业，打击了大中型企业，打击了经济效益高的地区，损失很大。如不反思，我国的经济实力将再度受到严重的影响。
