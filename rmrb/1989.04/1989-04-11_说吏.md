In Yu Keng-tang's book *Scholars and Chinese Culture*, the discussion on Han officials and cultural dissemination made me recall the author's mention in another historical work of three important components in China's political tradition: the imperial authority, the bureaucratic system, and the clerical system. When talking about social politics, people most easily think of the first two. In fact, the role of clerks in China's political history is concealed and highly effective.

First, it must be clarified that the "clerks" referred to here are the so-called "subordinate clerks" in history, who are not part of the bureaucratic class but are office assistants for scholar-officials. Xu Yuanrui's preface to *Guide to Clerkly Learning* states: "An official must rely on clerks, otherwise governance will be chaotic. Clerks are indispensable to officials." Ancient requirements for clerks were very high: they must be proficient in writing, eloquent, knowledgeable in laws, familiar with Confucian classics, skilled in calculations, and have neat handwriting. It is also stated that "clerks take the law as their teacher; without the law, clerks have nothing to follow." Isn't Song Jiang from *Water Margin* originally a "petty clerk"?

Ancient Chinese officials did not serve long-term in one place, but clerks had more enduring and direct relationships with local people. Once they caused harm, it was more difficult to deal with. Therefore, wise people from ancient times often criticized the "harm of subordinate clerks." The most famous examples are probably Ye Shi's discussions in his own collection and Huang Zongxi's analysis in *Waiting for the Dawn*.

Historically, there are many interesting examples of subordinate clerks abusing power and dealing with superiors. Official histories often record the achievements of officials, but it is in notes and miscellaneous books that we find stories of them being deceived. Even someone as sharp and upright as Bao Zheng could not escape. In the preface of the Wanli edition of *Bao Gong An* by Tao Hanyuan, there is such a story: "Once, Bao Gong hated the clerk's abuse of power. A citizen who had committed a serious crime sought help from the clerk. The clerk said, 'When you are interrogated, just plead for mercy endlessly, and I will handle it.' At the execution, the citizen indeed cried out for mercy. The clerk shouted from the side, 'Hurry up and accept your punishment, do not make a fuss here.' Bao Gong hated his encroachment on power and ultimately gave him a lighter sentence and let him go." Another story is from *Yi Jian Zhi* Volume 6, "Cunning Clerks Commit Evil": "Lu Gong was initially very sharp, and no one dared to offend him. Later, there were also gaps that could be exploited. Lu Gong loved learning, and whenever he read a book, he would study its meaning. If he understood it, he would be content and whistle. If he did not understand, he would scratch his head and hesitate. The clerk waited for him to whistle and then entered with documents, even if they contained hidden schemes, he would not ask. If he encountered him scratching his head, even small deceptions would be exposed."

Ancient officials who thought themselves clever and self-righteous would not be few, and clerks who specialized in guessing their superiors' thoughts and seizing opportunities to act privately naturally emerged. Therefore, I believe that investigating the causes of the emergence of such official-clerk networks is an important topic in Chinese political history.

    在余英时先生的《士与中国文化》一书中有关汉吏与文化传播的探讨，使我想起作者在另一本史学著作中提到的问题，即在中国的政治传统中，至少有三个重要的组成部分：君统、官统、吏统。说到社会政治，人们最容易想到的是前两者。其实，吏在中国政治历史中所扮演的角色，是隐蔽和富有实效的。
    先要说明的是，这里说的“吏”，是指历史上非官僚阶层的所谓“胥吏”，即为士大夫官僚配置的办事人员。徐元瑞《习吏幼学指南》序云：“居官必任吏，否则政乖。吏之于官，实非小补”。古代对吏的要求是很高的，条件是“行遣熟闲，语言辩利，通习条法，晓解儒书，算法精明，字画端正。”而且说明，“吏人以法律为师，非法律则吏无所守。”《水浒》中的宋江，当初不就是个“刀笔小吏”吗？
    中国古代的官僚并不长期任职于某地，倒是小吏们和地方民众的关系更长久，更直接。而一旦为害，也更令人难办。因此古来的有识之士，也常常痛陈“胥吏之害”。最著名的，大概要数叶适在自己的文集中和黄宗羲在《明夷待访录》中的议论。叶适描述了宋代官场里胥吏对官僚机构的侵害，黄宗羲则分析了胥吏敢于为害的三种原因。
    历史上，胥吏为害擅权、对付上司的实例，颇多有趣者。正史传记中记载的往往是官僚们得意的政绩，倒是笔记、杂书，泄露出一些他们被愚弄的故事。精明刚直如包拯亦不能免。在明万历刊本《龙图公案》的陶烺元叙文里，有这样一个故事：“昔包公尝恶吏擅权。民有得重罪者，求救于吏。吏曰：‘汝当鞠问时，但哀求不已，我自有处。’临刑，民果哀呼不已。吏在旁喝道：‘快领罪去，不得在此叫号。’包公恶其侵权，竟与以轻罪而去。”另一个故事出自《夷坚志》甲志卷六“猾吏为奸”条：“罗公初精明，人莫敢犯，后亦有罅可入云。罗好学，每读书必研究意义。苟有得，则怡然长啸。或未会意，则搔首踟蹰。吏伺其长啸，即抱牍以入，虽包藏机械，略不问。或遇其搔首，虽小奸欺，无不发摘。”
    古代为官者自作聪明，自以为是的大约不会很少，专门揣摸上司心理，伺机循私的“吏”们自然应运而生。所以我以为探究产生这类官吏网现象的原因，是中国政治史的一个重要课题。
