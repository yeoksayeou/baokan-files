The modernization of short-range missiles has been a thorny issue for NATO in recent years. Due to differing opinions among member states, the modernization plan has been delayed. It is said that the NATO summit in late May will finally approve the modernization plan, putting an end to the debate.

However, recent developments indicate that member states' opinions have not converged as the summit approaches. Following Germany, the Belgian government has explicitly stated its opposition to making a decision on the modernization of short-range missiles before 1991-1992. Thousands of protesters in Brussels have also demonstrated against the plan to update the short-range missiles.

It seems that the modernization plan faces significant obstacles, and the debate is unlikely to be resolved in the short term. The controversy surrounding this plan reflects deep-seated strategic differences among NATO member states on a series of major issues. It also highlights the contradictions between NATO's old model and the new realities of the world. On issues such as how to respond to the Warsaw Pact's disarmament proposals and formulating a new strategy towards the Soviet Union, the views of the United States and Western European allies diverge significantly. The Bush administration's policy towards the Soviet Union emphasizes "caution," "prudence," and "realism," while Western European countries are enthusiastic about "pan-European cooperation." The idea of establishing a "new peace order" in Europe, proposed by the West German foreign minister, has gained support from most Western European countries. The notion of "bloc first" and "alliance above all" is gradually losing its appeal, while "European unity" has become a fashionable and influential slogan. Additionally, when weighing the pros and cons of NATO's various policies, the governments of Western European countries often prioritize national interests, public sentiment, and domestic needs. For example, the Kohl government's refusal to make an immediate decision on the modernization plan is partly to win the support of anti-war and anti-nuclear groups and secure victory in the next election.

In today's context, where Western European economic strength has relatively increased and trade frictions between the U.S. and Europe are frequent, it is difficult to imagine that the European NATO countries will, like 40 years ago, simply follow American orders. Since the Reykjavik summit between the U.S. and Soviet leaders, Western European allies have made it clear to the U.S. that any decisions regarding arms control must be fully consulted with them and gain their agreement; otherwise, it will only escalate mutual suspicion and lead to division. This time, West Germany and Belgium are firmly against the modernization of short-range missiles, and the U.S. can only patiently persuade and wait.

In summary, the process of détente and disarmament between the East and West has, in turn, posed a serious challenge to NATO's internal relations. At present, it seems that no one has a solution to help NATO get out of its predicament. The recently released three principles of the Bush administration's foreign policy emphasize that the U.S. should maintain its leading position in the West. In mid-April, President Bush and NATO Secretary-General Werner met in Washington and merely reiterated the U.S.'s general obligations to NATO without any new ideas. It was Werner's proposed compromise solution that attracted some attention. Werner suggested that, given the significant differences, there is no need to force member states to make deployment commitments. As long as they unanimously affirm the continuous updating of missiles, that would suffice. Obviously, this suggestion can only alleviate the contradictions but cannot resolve them.

It appears that NATO needs to break free from the old thinking and frameworks of the Cold War and confrontation, propose new strategies based on the new realities of the world, and adjust the relationship between the leader and the member states. Otherwise, it will be difficult for NATO to escape the cycle of internal conflicts and endless disputes.

　　在旧模式和新现实之间
    郑园园
    短程导弹的“现代化”问题，是近年来困扰北约的一个难题。因盟国意见不一致，“现代化”计划迟迟定不下来。据说，５月底的北约首脑会议将把“现代化”计划最终肯定下来，为这场争论打上一个句号。
    然而，最近的事态发展表明，盟国的意见并未随着首脑会议的临近而趋于一致。继联邦德国之后，比利时政府明确表示反对在１９９１—１９９２年之前作出短程导弹“现代化”决定，布鲁塞尔成千上万的群众抗议更新短导的计划。
    看来，“现代化”计划阻力重重，争论难以在短期内平息。这个计划引发的争论，实际上反映了北约盟国在一系列重大战略问题上的深刻分歧，反映了北约旧模式和世界新现实之间的矛盾。在诸如怎样回答华约的裁军建议、制订一项什么样的对苏新战略等问题上，美国和西欧盟国的看法距离很大，双方强调的重点不一致。布什政府对苏政策的基调是“谨慎”、“小心”、“现实主义”，西欧国家则对“全欧合作”倾注着热情，西德外长提出的建立欧洲“新和平秩序”的设想得到多数西欧国家的支持。“集团第一”、“联盟至上”的观点逐渐失去市场，“欧洲联合”成为时髦和有号召力的口号。此外，在权衡北约各项政策的利弊得失时，西欧各国政府往往把本国利益、大众情绪、内政需要摆在首位。例如，科尔政府拒绝现在就对“现代化”计划作出抉择，一个重要原因是为了赢得反战反核群众的支持，争取在下次大选中获胜。
    在西欧经济实力相对增强和美欧不断发生贸易摩擦的今天，很难设想欧洲北约国家会像４０年前那样听任美国发号施令。从雷克雅未克美苏首脑会晤始，西欧盟国就让美国懂得，有关军备控制的任何决定，必须同它们充分协商，征得它们的同意，否则，只能加剧彼此猜疑，导致分裂。这次，西德、比利时对短导“现代化”硬是不赞成，美国也只好耐着性子说服和等待。
    总之，东西方缓和和裁军的进程，反过来对北约的内部关系提出了严峻的挑战。眼下，似乎还没有谁能开出使北约摆脱困境的处方。最近出台的布什政府外交政策的三项原则，强调美国仍应保持西方领导的地位，４月中，布什总统和北约秘书长韦尔纳在华盛顿会晤时，也只是一般性地重复美国对北约的义务，并无新意。倒是韦尔纳提出的一个妥协折中方案，稍稍引起舆论的注意。韦尔纳说，既然分歧那么大，就不必强求盟国作出部署的承诺。只要它们一致对不断更新导弹给予总的肯定就行了。显然，这个建议充其量只能缓解矛盾，并不能解决矛盾。
    看来，北约需要摆脱冷战和对峙的旧思维、旧框架，根据新的世界现实，提出新的战略，调整盟主和盟国的关系，否则，它就难以摆脱内部矛盾迭起，争吵不休的局面。
