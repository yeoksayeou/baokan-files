Last year, Nantong City's township enterprises spent 200 million yuan on assessments and entertaining guests, which accounted for 11.1% of the total profit. In the suburbs, a township-run factory spent over 40,000 yuan on these expenses alone in one year. When a garment factory in Nantong County established an enterprise group, officials from the province, city, county, and township all rushed in, causing the number of invited guests to far exceed the original plan. A single event cost tens of thousands of yuan. Some small factories with weak foundations and limited funds could not withstand the constant harassment, resulting in severe losses. Some factories under construction were forced to halt due to the inability to cope with the feasting and assessment winds.

An official from the Nantong City Township Enterprises Bureau stated that if the feasting and assessment winds are not curbed, not only will the development of township enterprises be difficult, but the overall social atmosphere will also be severely affected.

　　吃喝摊派　轮番折腾
    南通乡镇企业一年支出２亿元
    去年，南通市乡镇企业用于摊派和招待吃喝的费用达２亿元，占利润总额的１１．１％。郊区有一家乡办工厂，一年用于这方面的开支就有４万多元。南通县一家绣衣厂组建企业集团时，省、市、县、乡各路诸侯蜂拥而至，致使原请的客员大大超额。一次活动下来，花掉数万元。有的小厂底子薄，资金有限，经不起轮番折腾，亏损严重；有些正在筹建中的工厂，因招架不住吃喝风、摊派风，半路夭折。
    南通市乡镇企业局负责人说，不刹住吃喝、摊派风，不仅乡镇企业发展艰难，而且严重影响整个社会风气。
