People's Daily, United Nations, April 20th.

The 43rd session of the United Nations General Assembly today passed a resolution on the "Palestinian Issue" with an overwhelming majority, condemning the recent killings of innocent civilians by Israeli troops in the occupied territories.

During the voting, 129 countries, including China, voted in favor, while the United States and Israel voted against, and Liberia abstained.

The resolution urges the Security Council to urgently review the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories and take necessary measures to provide international protection for Palestinian civilians in the occupied areas.

The resolution demands that the Israeli occupying authorities strictly adhere to the Geneva Conventions of August 12, 1949, on the Protection of Civilians in Time of War, and immediately stop all forms of repression against Palestinian residents.

The resolution also emphasizes the urgent need to convene an international peace conference on the Middle East under the auspices of the United Nations as soon as possible.

At the request of Saudi Arabia, this session of the UNGA reconvened yesterday to discuss the Palestinian issue. During the two-day debate, representatives from 43 countries spoke, with the vast majority condemning the recent intensified repression of Palestinian residents by the Israeli authorities, which has further exacerbated the situation there.

People's Daily, United Nations, April 20th.

China today urged the Israeli authorities to "change their erroneous Middle East policy, adopt a realistic stance, and contribute to an early resolution of the Palestinian issue."

Today, at the 43rd session of the UNGA discussing the "Palestinian Issue," China's Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Yu Mengjia, pointed out that since the beginning of this year, the international community has made many efforts to resolve the Middle East issue, especially the Arab countries and the PLO, which have proposed constructive suggestions and shown sincerity in peacefully resolving the Middle East issue, including the Palestinian issue. However, the Israeli authorities have persisted in their erroneous stance, causing the Middle East peace process to stall.

Yu Mengjia condemned the Israeli authorities for further using force against unarmed Palestinian residents, resulting in serious casualties, and threatening peace and security in the Middle East region.

Yu Mengjia finally pointed out, "The fundamental solution to the Middle East and Palestinian issues lies in Israel withdrawing from the territories it has illegally occupied since 1967 and recognizing the national rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to self-determination."

　　第四十三届联大复会通过决议    
    谴责以色列在占领区的暴行    
    我敦促以色列改变错误的中东政策
    本报联合国４月２０日电  记者刘开宸报道：第４３届联合国大会今天以压倒多数通过“巴勒斯坦问题”的决议，谴责以色列军队最近在占领区枪杀无辜平民的暴行。
    投票表决时，中国等１２９票赞成，美国和以色列反对，利比里亚弃权。
    决议请安理会紧急审议被占领的巴勒斯坦领土局势，采取必要措施，对占领区的巴勒斯坦平民提供国际保护。
    决议要求以色列占领当局严格遵守１９４９年８月１２日的《关于战时保护平民的日内瓦公约》，立即停止镇压巴勒斯坦居民的各种暴行。
    决议还强调迫切需要早日召开在联合国主持下的中东问题国际和平会议。
    本届联大应沙特要求于昨天复会，审议巴勒斯坦问题。在两天的辩论中，共有４３国代表发言，绝大多数代表谴责以色列当局最近加紧镇压巴勒斯坦居民，导致那里局势进一步恶化。
    本报联合国４月２０日电　记者刘开宸报道：中国今天敦促以列色当局“改变其错误的中东政策，采取现实立场，以利于巴勒斯坦问题的早日解决”。
    中国常驻联合国副代表俞孟嘉大使今天在审议“巴勒斯坦问题”的第４３届联大会议上指出，今年初以来，国际社会为解决中东问题作出了许多努力，特别是阿拉伯国家和巴解组织，为此提出了建设性建议，表现出和平解决包括巴勒斯坦问题在内的中东问题的诚意，但是以色列当局仍坚持其错误立场，致使中东和平进程停滞不前。
    俞孟嘉谴责以色列当局最近还进一步用武力对付手无寸铁的巴勒斯坦居民，导致严重伤亡，也威胁了中东地区的和平与安全。
    俞孟嘉最后指出，“解决中东和巴勒斯坦问题的根本出路，在于以色列撤出１９６７年以来非法占领的领土，承认巴勒斯坦人民的民族权利，包括自决权”。
