Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega on April 22nd stated that the Bush administration's recent provision of new economic aid to Nicaraguan anti-government forces and the continuation of the economic blockade on Nicaragua, which began under the Reagan administration in 1985, is "adding fuel to the fire" in the volatile situation in Central America.

Ortega made these remarks at a press conference held on the eve of his visit to the ten Western European countries. He said the main purpose of the visit is to inform the leaders of the Western European countries about the Nicaraguan government's implementation of the Central American peace agreement and to seek economic aid from these countries.

At the press conference, President Ortega criticized the U.S. government for extending the stay of U.S. troops in Honduras and accused the Nicaraguan anti-government forces of violating the ceasefire agreement and resuming their harassment of villagers. He said the Nicaraguan government has fulfilled its promises to release Somoza supporters and to amend the election and press laws. He hopes that other Central American countries will also fulfill their promises and work towards achieving true peace in the region.

　　尼加拉瓜总统发表谈话  批评美国的中美洲政策
    新华社马那瓜四月二十二日电  尼加拉瓜总统奥尔特加二十二日指出，布什政府最近向尼加拉瓜反政府武装提供新的经济援助并延续里根政府一九八五年开始的对尼加拉瓜实行经济封锁的政策是向动荡的中美洲局势“火上加油”。
    奥尔特加是在他开始西欧十国之行前夕举行的记者招待会上讲这番话的。他说，访问西欧十国的主要目的是向西欧国家领导人通报尼加拉瓜政府执行中美洲和平协议的情况以及争取西欧国家的经济援助。
    奥尔特加总统在记者招待会上批评美国政府延长美军在洪都拉斯的驻扎时间，指责尼加拉瓜反政府武装破坏停火协议和恢复骚扰村民的犯罪活动。他说，尼政府已经履行了释放索摩查分子和修改选举法和新闻法的诺言。希望其它中美洲国家也要履行诺言，为实现该地区真正的和平而努力。
