	Funds Shortage Plagues Enterprises
	By People's Daily Reporter Méi Hóngrú

	Not long ago, at the gate of the Dongfang Electric Machine Factory in Deyang, Sichuan, a neatly dressed "unfortunate" person held up a sign, declaring that he would fast until the end. The stream of onlookers cast curious glances at him. This person was Deputy Director Wang of the Finance Department of the First Machine Tool Factory in Changchun, sent by the factory director to Dongfang Electric Machine Factory to demand payment for goods. He vowed not to return without the money.

	The director of Dongfang Electric Machine Factory called the director of the First Machine Tool Factory in Changchun to discuss a solution. The response from Changchun was: the debt must be repaid; Old Wang's health is not good, so take care of him.

	These two factories have a long-term cooperative relationship. In the past, the directors and department heads of both factories would greet each other politely when they met, but now, at this critical moment, they have become "indifferent to relatives." Are they quarreling over personal grievances? Of course not, they are both desperate due to the enterprises' financial difficulties, and they are at their wits' end.

	In recent months, the mutual arrears between enterprises have been escalating. The First Heavy Machinery Factory, the Second Heavy Machinery Factory, the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory, and other top ten heavy machinery factories in the country are mechanical industry bases that provide equipment for energy, transportation, and important raw material industries. They are known as "national treasures," but currently, these ten factories are all mired in debt. The accumulated debt owed to these ten factories by external entities is 490 million yuan, while these ten factories owe external entities 280 million yuan. One of the "ten heavy" factories, Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory, delivered equipment worth 12 million yuan to Anshan Iron and Steel Company in September last year, but the payment has not been made yet. Repeated demands for payment have been unsuccessful. Anshan Iron and Steel Company, in the economic overheating of last year, exceeded the scale of fixed asset investment, and now it needs to cut back. The investments already made are left on the construction site. In the past, they could use other funds to make payments; now, everyone is short of funds, so they can't pay, sorry...

	However, for a batch of heavy machinery manufacturing enterprises, arrears are indeed a matter of life and death. The money owed to them cannot be collected, causing great anxiety; the money they owe others, the creditors are fierce. Many steel mills and supply units that provide them with raw materials propose: to buy new materials, you must first repay old debts, otherwise, the supply relationship will be terminated. Moreover, new materials come with new rules, requiring a 130% prepayment of the goods price, fearing that you will default again. Many heavy machinery manufacturing enterprises are being forced into a corner. "First Heavy" and "Second Heavy" and several other factories were all once stopped or semi-stopped production in the first quarter. The reporter asked: "You can also use tough measures to get the money back, right?" "That won't work," several deputy chief accountants of heavy machinery factories complained. "Our products are all part of the state's mandatory plans, and even without payment, we must ensure supply."

	Now, various places are reducing the scale of loans, and these large enterprises have become the "stepchildren" in the local area. Local credit funds are limited and mainly used to maintain the expenses of local enterprises because they are the source of local finance. Thus, these enterprises related to national and people's livelihoods are pushed to Beijing to solve their difficulties. Since this year, the Harbin, Sichuan, and Shanghai three major power station equipment manufacturing groups have successively sent 15 chief accountants and deputy chief accountants to Beijing. They each brought the factory director's instructions: do not return to the factory without getting the money.

	The financial drought is plaguing the managers of state-owned large enterprises, and it is also affecting the hearts of every producer. Many enterprises have no money to buy raw materials and no money to pay wages. There is no way out, and some have come up with the new trick of "installment payment": on the day of salary issuance, first give 40%, and after a few days, when the funds are raised, give another 30%. Some have no choice but to force savings. Workers say, "During the three years of difficulty, we have never seen such a difficult time to issue wages." In a large enterprise in Sichuan, workers lined up in the cafeteria, banging their bowls and singing "The Internationale."

	If this financial drought is allowed to continue, then the production tasks of various large enterprises in the second half of this year and the first half of next year will be difficult to complete. Moreover, it will affect downstream enterprises. For example, if the production tasks of electric machines and steam turbines (main engines of power generation equipment) in the second half of this year and the first half of next year are not completed, it will affect the national power generation and supply in the second half of next year and the first half of the following year. The Ministry of Mechanical and Electrical Industry, which manages these enterprises, truthfully reported the situation to higher authorities. The State Council made a decisive decision to allocate 3 billion yuan in special funds to support key industrial and commercial enterprises nationwide to alleviate the difficulty of working capital.

	When the reporter conducted the interview, the funds were being distributed, some had been received, and some had not. The enterprises that received the money were like plants after a long drought encountering sweet rain, regaining their vitality. Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory sent a telegram to the ministry: "20 million yuan in loans have been credited, and all employees of the factory are jubilant. The factory is using all the funds for urgent production needs, and the factory's production is fully resuming."

	However, the person in charge of the supervising department said that these funds can only alleviate the immediate crisis of large enterprises. The fundamental solution is, first, to solve the problem of mutual arrears between enterprises; second, to determine the total amount of working capital needed for these enterprises' production, and then allocate it with a cap, for specific use.

　　资金短缺困扰着企业
    本报记者  梅洪如
    不久前，在四川德阳东方电机厂门口，一位衣帽整齐的“不幸者”举着牌子，声称要绝食到底。络绎不绝的围观者向他投注好奇的目光。这人是长春第一机床厂财务科王副科长，受厂长委托，到东方电机厂索要货款，要不到不回去。
    东方电机厂厂长打电话给长春第一机床厂厂长，征询解决办法。长春方面回答：欠款必须还；老王身体不大好，要注意他的健康。
    这两个厂有长期协作关系，往常双方的厂长、科长们见面都很客气，可是到了这个时候，却变得“六亲不认”了。他们闹个人意气吗？当然不是，都只为企业资金紧张，急得乱了招数。
    近几个月，企业间相互拖欠货款愈演愈烈。第一重型机器厂、第二重型机器厂、沈阳重型机器厂等国内十大重型机器厂，是专为能源、交通、重要原材料工业提供装备的机械工业基地，被称为“国宝”，可是目前这１０个厂家家陷入欠款的困扰中。累计外厂欠这１０个厂４．９亿元，１０个厂欠外厂２．８亿元。“十重”之一的太原重型机器厂，去年９月交付鞍钢价值１２００万元的设备，货款至今未还，一次一次催讨无结果。鞍钢在去年经济过热中固定资产投资超过规模，现在要压缩，已经投进去的，撂在工地上。以往可以调用其它资金还款；现在谁都缺资金，还款，对不起……“要命有一条”。
    可是，拖欠对一批重型机械制造企业来说确实是要命的。人家欠他们的，要不到手，干着急；他们欠人家的，逼债可凶了。许多给他们提供原材料的钢厂、供货单位提出：要买新料，得先归还旧债，否则终止供货关系。而且，新料新章程，要买得预付１３０％的货款，怕你再拖欠。不少重型机器制造企业被逼得走投无路。“一重”、“二重”等几个厂一季度都一度停产或半停产。记者问道：“你们也可以使硬手段把款要回来啊？”“那不成，我们的产品都属于国家指令性计划，不付款也得保证供应。”几位重型机器厂的副总会计师抱怨说。
    现在各地都在压缩贷款规模，这些大企业在地方上便成了“后娘”的孩子。地方信贷资金有限，主要用来维持地方企业的开支，因为那是地方财政的水源。于是，这些关系国计民生的大企业就被推到北京去解决困难了。今年以来，哈尔滨、四川、上海三大电站设备制造集团，先后派了１５位总会计师、副总会计师到北京，他们各自带着厂长的嘱托：要不到钱不要回厂。
    资金饥渴困扰着国营大企业的经营者们，也牵动着每个生产者的心。许多企业买原材料没钱，发工资也拿不出钱。没有办法，有的想出了“分期付款”的新招：发薪头天先给４０％，过两天等筹到款后再发３０％。有的实在没办法，只好强迫储蓄。工人们说，“３年困难时期”都没有见过发工资这么困难的。四川有个大企业的食堂里，工人们排着队，边敲饭碗，边唱国际歌。
    如果让这资金饥渴症任其延续下去，那末，各大企业今年下半年、明年上半年的生产任务都难完成。而且影响到下游企业。比如今年下半年、明年上半年的电机、汽轮机（发电设备主机）生产任务完不成，将影响明年下半年、后年上半年国家的电力生产和供应。主管这些企业的机械电子工业部如实地向上反映了情况。国务院当机立断，拨出３０亿元专项资金，支持全国重点工商企业缓解流动资金困难。
    记者采访之时，资金正在下达，有的已收到，有的还没收到。收到钱的企业像久旱遇甘露，重新恢复了生机。太原重型机器厂向部里打电报称：“２０００万元贷款已入帐，全厂职工欢欣鼓舞。我厂正将全部款项用于生产急需，工厂生产正全面恢复。”
    但是，主管部门同志讲，这些资金只能缓解大企业燃眉之急。治本的办法，一是要解决企业与企业之间的拖欠；二是要核定这些企业生产需用的流动资金总额，然后戴帽下达，专款专用。
