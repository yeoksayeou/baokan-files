The new semester has just begun, and our school library has decided that students who enter the literature and arts periodical room will have to pay 5 fen per person per visit.

University libraries are supposed to provide students with a place for free learning, reading, and research outside of class. However, our school has taken a disappointing step, justifying it as a means of "raising funds."

　　大学图书馆阅览要收费
    新学期开学不久，我院图书馆决定：凡是本院的学生，进入文艺类期刊室，每人每次需交５分钱。
    大学图书馆本业就是无偿为学生提供课外学习、阅读、研究的必备场所。可是，我院却做出令同学失望之举，还美其名曰：“创收”。
