Britain has a widespread culture of keeping dogs, not just among the upper classes, but also among ordinary residents. Whether in rural villas, small towns, or in the city of London, traces of dogs can be found everywhere. According to statistics, Britain has 6.8 million dogs.

Dogs can help people relax, entertain, or provide some comfort, but they also bring many problems to society. In Britain, thousands of postal workers, cleaners, and pedestrians are bitten by dogs each year. The Ministry of Health spends approximately 6 million pounds annually on treating people bitten by dogs. Unattended dogs cause about 54,000 traffic accidents each year. Dog feces are abundant on the streets, affecting the city's appearance. Cleaning up dog feces is both costly and troublesome.

The British Animal Protection Committee actively advocates that anyone who keeps a dog must register it and pay a dog tax to the local government. This can enhance people's sense of responsibility towards animals, preventing dogs from roaming freely on streets and fields without an owner. Additionally, citizens need to be educated on how to keep dogs and maintain public hygiene. It seems that the British government has a lot of work to do to quickly address the public nuisance caused by dogs.

　　英国狗多为患
    英国盛行养狗，不仅上流社会如此，普通居民也很普遍。无论在乡间别墅、小城镇，还是伦敦城，处处留有狗的踪迹。据统计，英国有六百八十万条狗。
    狗能帮人消闲、解闷或给人某种安慰，但给整个社会却带来了不少麻烦。在英国，每年有几千名邮递员、清洁工人和行人被狗咬伤。卫生部每年为治疗被狗咬伤的人约须花费六百万英镑。无人照看的狗每年引起五万四千起交通事故。街道上狗粪甚多，影响了市容。清理狗粪是件既花钱又伤脑筋的问题。
    英国保护动物委员会积极主张，凡养狗者必须登记，并向地方政府交纳狗税。这样可以增强人们对动物的责任感，狗不能没有主人带领，而在街道、田野上到处乱跑。另外还要教育公民，如何养狗，怎样保持公共场所的卫生等。看来，如何尽快解决狗给社会带来的公害，英国政府还有很多工作要做。
