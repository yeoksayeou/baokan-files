Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 16th.

A man who threw explosives into his neighbor's house, Liu Shucai, had his right hand amputated in a hospital and was sent back to the detention center of the Public Security Bureau in Zhuozhou City, Hebei Province, on March 13th.

Two years ago, Liu's neighbor, Wu, was building a house and knocked down a two-foot-high earthen wall that Liu believed belonged to his family. The two families had a verbal altercation, but the issue was never raised again. However, Liu held a grudge. On the evening of February 22nd, Liu sneaked to the back window of Wu's house. The first homemade grenade he attempted to light with a match exploded prematurely, blowing off half of his right hand and injuring his legs and eyes in multiple places. He then lit another package of explosives with a cigarette and threw it through the window into Wu's house. The roof of Wu's house was damaged, but no one was injured. Liu fled the scene but was apprehended by police from Zhuozhou City at dawn on the 23rd.

Liu Shucai is a 26-year-old farmer from Mazhu Village, Lancamp Township, Zhuozhou City. According to his confession, he stole the explosives from a quarry in Fangshan District, Beijing, and found the grenade shell in a scrap metal pile. These items led to the loss of one of his hands, several injuries, and his legs being shackled in heavy iron chains.

　　法盲炸掉一只手　双脚套上大铁镣
    本报讯　记者徐如俊报道：往邻居家里扔炸药的案犯刘树才，在医院做完切肢手术，３月１３日被押回河北省涿州市公安局看守所。
    两年前案犯的邻居吴某盖房时，把刘树才认为属他家的一座两尺多高的土墙头推倒了。当时两家吵了几句嘴，尔后虽一直没再提起过，但刘犯心中仍有气。今年２月２２日晚，刘摸到邻居吴某家的后窗下面。第一次用火柴点燃的自制手榴弹，没有出手就爆炸，右手被炸掉了一大半，腿部、眼部多处受伤。紧接着，他又用香烟头点燃带去的炸药包，从后窗扔进吴家。吴家房顶被震坏，但未伤及人命。案犯潜逃后，市公安干警于２３日凌晨将他抓获。
    刘树才是涿州市兰营乡毛屯村农民，今年２６岁。据他供认，炸药是在北京市房山区某村开山时偷回的，手榴弹壳是从废铁堆里拣的。这两样东西，使这位法盲失去了一只手，留下了几处伤，双脚套上了一副大铁镣。
