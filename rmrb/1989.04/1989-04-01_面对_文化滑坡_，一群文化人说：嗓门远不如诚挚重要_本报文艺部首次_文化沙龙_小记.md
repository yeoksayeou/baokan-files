To attract readers, newspaper editors want to create innovative columns; to rely on authors, they want to connect with talented writers; to broaden their influence, they want to engage with eloquent actors and cultural managers who are eager to cultivate talent. Newspaper editors are not content to spend their days staring at manuscripts and typesetting; they do not want to meet friends only over the phone or at seminars. Imagine this: editors, authors, and actors who are also readers and news figures—all gathered together. Those who want to sing take the stage, those who want to chat sit down, singers perform to their hearts' content, and conversationalists talk to their hearts' content. What a lively scene!

The cultural department of the People's Daily, in collaboration with the Beijing Geological Hall Entertainment Center, organized a "Cultural Salon." Its first activity was held on March 24, during the spring night of the Two Sessions. The venue was the Geological Hall, a place of art, with a cinema, a billiard room, and a karaoke bar.

"Today's activity is called a 'Cultural Salon,' although the word 'salon' was once more frightening than a shark..." Representative of the organizing unit, Lan Ling, gave an opening speech in the style of a miscellaneous essay, emphasizing equality among all participants. Among the 150-plus guests were many of China's cultural elites, including members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and leading cadres. Introductions were made using only names, without titles.

Idu Jianjian, who has long subscribed to the People's Daily and occasionally contributes small articles, not only sang himself but also cheerfully hosted the event. The elegant and relaxed atmosphere and the audience's detailed "summoning" stirred the desire to perform in one cultural celebrity after another. Wei Minglun opened his "Shakespearean voice" to sing a segment of Sichuan opera; Yang Xianyi, known as the "Wine Immortal," hummed a few lines of the English song "Safe Journey" in a drunken state; Yu Feng improvised lyrics for a folk song on the spot; Chen Geng and Zhang Fei sang a familiar tune from their youth; Zhang Xianliang and Shen Peng each told a humorous anecdote, supposedly from their own experiences, both making the audience smile. Chen Haosu, accompanied by a karaoke machine, sang the theme song of "Snow City" with a somewhat offbeat rhythm and pitch, but with great sincerity, and was considered one of the best performances. Only Su Xiaokang, who is often lost in thought in his reportage, was reluctant to take the stage, but his sincerity won him applause.

Professional actors, of course, had more authentic performances. Cheng Lin, to show that she had grown up, presented a song "The Kiss of Sand"; Jiang Jiatang sang a poem by Li Bai, set to music by Liu Wengold, with a beautiful rhythm; Hu Songhua once again offered a Mongolian song "Ode." Chen Peisi and Zhu Shimao said that performing skits had become as routine as eating noodles for them, so they each sang a popular song, but still needed Idu Jianjian's assistance. Chen Qiang's rendition of a song from the character Huang Shiren reminded people of his role 40 years ago, while Zhu Lin's performance of "Eighteen Songs of the Barren Pipe" from her role as Cai Wenji 30 years ago still resonates today. Wang Jinggu, sometimes a "tragic author" wiping tears with his manuscript, sometimes a comedian who makes himself laugh before he even starts, presented two solo performances that had the entire audience in stitches. Huang Zongjiang, who transitioned from acting to scriptwriting, declined an invitation to sing a song in English as Lou Aoshu, instead imitating the style of his senior, Shi Hui, from the days of Huang Zuolin, singing a few lines of distorted Beijing opera: "When good friends meet, a thousand cups are not enough; when words do not match, even half a sentence is too much."

Several well-traveled writers all commented: some performances are rarely seen elsewhere, and some would not be out of place in a Spring Festival TV gala.

The calligraphers and painters also took the opportunity to create. Fang Cheng and Miao Di drew caricature portraits, Han Meilin painted a large, freehand horse. Huang Miaozi wrote a strict and elegant seal script "Do not urinate here," according to Huang Zongjiang's note, to respond to the Beijing municipal government's call to reopen civil education before the Asian Games. Huang Yongyu drew a magpie, inscribed with: "In music, a loud voice is far less important than sincerity." Was this to comfort the amateur performers who had just taken the stage, or to discuss the way of being and writing?

Those who did not take the stage were not just there to watch; the salon was more importantly a gathering for cultural exchange. I saw novelist Liu Heng discussing scripts with the filmmakers Xie Fei and Jiang Wen; Su Wei, who had just returned from the United States, and Zhang Nuannan, who had filmed in France, had a long conversation. At the round tables, there were also Sun Daguan, Fan Rongkang, Li Renshen, Mou Jianhua, Yin Shoushi, Wu Zuzhang, Zheng Rong, Shao Yanxiang, Yuan Ying, Mu Hui, Liu Zheng, Cong Weixi, Lin Zhaohua... Many distinguished figures gathered, but it is impossible to list them all.

In summary, the outcome of the salon will be reflected in the pages of the newspaper. The editors at the salon also did not forget to solicit articles. We handed out a solicitation letter to each attendee, which read: "The cultural supplement of this newspaper plans to set up a 'Cultural Salon' column... We only want to invite some cultural figures to talk about everyday matters, to explore the subtle and profound aspects in the various phenomena that are often lumped together under the term 'big culture' today... To chat about the world, to express random thoughts, the writing does not need to be eloquent, the words do not need to be profound, simplicity and directness are best... Cultural figures have no power to reverse the course of things, and seem helpless in the face of 'cultural decline.' Doing some constructive work may help alleviate some of the difficulties in the current cultural predicament."

The "Cultural Salon" will continue, both as a column and as a gathering. We cannot invite every reader who reads this report to participate, but you will share the results in the newspaper. We remember that the ultimate beneficiaries should be you.

### 面对“文化滑坡”，一群文化人说：嗓门远不如诚挚重要——本报文艺部首次“文化沙龙”小记

　　面对“文化滑坡”，一群文化人说：
    嗓门远不如诚挚重要
    ——本报文艺部首次“文化沙龙”小记
    李彤
    编报纸要吸引读者，于是想开辟花样翻新的专栏；编报纸要仰仗作者，于是想联络笔下生花的文友；编报纸还需要更广泛的关系和影响，于是联系上一批舌灿莲花的演员和有心栽花的文化经理们。编报纸的不甘心整天枯对着稿纸和铅字，编报纸的不愿意只在电话里和研讨会上去结识朋友。想想看，编者、作者和既是读者又是新闻人物的演员们——一批文化人欢聚一堂，愿引吭者登台，愿交谈者促膝，唱者尽兴，谈者尽情，那是什么劲头？  　我们《人民日报》文艺部联合北京地质礼堂娱乐中心就办了这么一个“文化沙龙”。它首次活动是在３月２４日，正逢两会召开之际的一个春夜。地点就在地质礼堂这个有艺术电影院，有台球场，有卡拉ＯＫ歌厅的文娱之苑。
    “今天的活动叫‘文化沙龙’，尽管沙龙这个词曾经比鲨鱼还可怕……”代表主办单位的蓝翎以杂文语言致开场白，他强调沙龙之中，人人平等。１５０多位来宾中不乏当今中国的文化精英，有全国政协委员，也有领导干部，介绍时皆以姓名相称，不带职衔。
    自称长期自费订阅《人民日报》同时也为《人民日报》写一点小文章的郁钧剑，除自己唱歌，还胜任愉快地担任了节目主持人。场中优雅轻松的气氛和观众颇详内情的“点将”，调动起一位位文化名人的表演欲望。魏明伦扯开“莎士比亚的嗓门”唱一段川剧；被称之为“酒仙”的杨宪益借着醉意哼了两句英语的《一路平安》；郁风即景编词来上一曲民歌；晨耕、张非也合唱了他们年轻时熟悉的小调；潇洒的张贤亮和拘谨的沈鹏各讲一段据说是本人经历的笑话，同样使人开颜。陈昊苏在卡拉ＯＫ带的伴奏下，虽然节奏和音调都不那么准却极为认真地高歌一曲《雪城》主题歌，被公认为最佳节目之一。只有在报告文学中耽于沉思的苏晓康登台无奈，但他的真诚赢得了掌声。
    专业演员们献技自有更为地道的拿手好戏。程琳为显示自己长大了，呈上一首《沙的吻》；姜嘉锵把在场的刘文金谱曲的一首李白诗唱得抑扬顿挫；胡松华依旧献上一曲蒙古语的《赞歌》。陈佩斯和朱时茂称演小品对他们来说已经像吃面条一样吃伤了，于是各自演唱了一首流行歌曲，终不免需要郁钧剑在旁相助。陈强一曲黄世仁的唱段提醒人们不忘他４０年前那个角色，而朱琳３０年前所饰《蔡文姬》的一拍《胡笳十八拍》，绕梁直至今日。王景愚时而是以稿拭泪的“悲剧作者”，时而是未开口先笑倒了自己的讲笑话人，一悲一喜两个独角戏形象引得全场捧腹。由演员转为编剧的黄宗江不知该归入专业组还是业余组，他谢绝了用英语演唱娄阿鼠的邀请，而模仿他在黄佐临先生门下的师兄石挥当年的腔调，唱了两句变味儿的京剧：“酒逢知己千杯少，话不投机半句多。”
    几位见多识广的文人皆如此评价：有些节目在别处难得一见，有些节目放到春节电视晚会中也毫不逊色。
    书画家们乘兴挥毫。方成、苗地作漫画人像，韩美林作大写意骏马。黄苗子以法度严整的篆书题一幅“此处不可小便”，据黄宗江作注，其意在响应亚运会之前北京市政府重开文明教育的号召。黄永玉画了一幅八哥，题款为：“在音乐中嗓门远远不如诚挚重要”。这是在安慰刚才登台的业余演员们呢，还是在讲为人为文之道？
    未登台者也不仅仅来当观众，沙龙更主要地是文人交流的雅集。我看见写小说的刘恒与拍他的电影的谢飞、姜文在切磋剧本；打美国回来的苏炜和去法国拍过片子的张暖忻长时间交谈。在一张张圆桌旁聚首的，还有孙大光、范荣康、李仁臣、牟建华，有尹瘦石、吴祖光、郑榕、邵燕祥、袁鹰、牧惠、刘征、从维熙、林兆华……群贤毕至，可惜不能备举。
    说了归齐，沙龙的结果要体现在版面上，编报人在沙龙上也忘不了约稿。我们向每一位到会者递上一封约稿信，上面写道：“本报文艺副刊拟设《文化沙龙》专栏……只想请些文化人，谈些日常事，于时下惯于以‘大文化’笼而统之的各类现象里，探幽抉微，阐发妙理。……谈天说地，随感而发，文不必锦心绣口，话不必艰涩深奥，平易朴直最妙。……文化人最无回天之力，面对‘文化滑坡’似乎也无可奈何。做一点建设性工作，也许能为眼下的文化困境排解一点忧难。”
    “文化沙龙”将举办下去，作为一个专栏，也作为一种聚会。我们当然不可能请每一位读到这篇小记的朋友都来参加，但你们将在报纸上分享其结果。我们记着呢，最终的受益者应该是你们。
