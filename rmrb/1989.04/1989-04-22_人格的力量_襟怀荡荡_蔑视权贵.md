    The Power of Character
    Open-hearted and Contemptuous of the Powerful

    In 1952, Comrade Hu Yaobang was transferred to the position of Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. Over the years, he was open-hearted and upright in his conduct. When he first started working at the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, he declared in his policy speech: "If my work is not done well, you can report me to the Central Committee of the Party!"

    Comrade Hu Yaobang had long been disdainful of Kang Sheng's ultra-leftist ideological line. As early as the Yan'an period, when Hu Yaobang served as the Director of the General Political Department's Organization Department, he did not associate with Kang Sheng. On August 31, 1966, the Central Cultural Revolution Group sent Wang Li to the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League to announce the dismissal of a large number of Youth League cadres. Despite Kang Sheng being a consultant to the Central Cultural Revolution Group at the time, that night, Hu Yaobang still publicly said: "Kang Sheng is an old leftist." He also expressed his views on Jiang Qing, Wang Li, and others.

    Before the Ninth National Congress of the Party, Hu Yaobang, as a "capitalist roader," was being criticized and struggled against. Premier Zhou Enlai reported to Chairman Mao, proposing to select a few young "Eighth National Congress" Central Committee members to serve as "Ninth National Congress" Central Committee members, with the targets being Hu Yaobang and Tan Qilong, the two "Little Red Devils."

    During the Ninth National Congress, Kang Sheng extended his hand to shake hands with Hu Yaobang, but Hu Yaobang turned his head and walked away. As a result, he did not become a member of the "Ninth National Congress" Central Committee.

    Later, the cadres of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League collectively petitioned, requesting that Hu Yaobang be appointed as a member of the National People's Congress. Wang Dongxing had a talk with him and pointed out that as long as he admitted to opposing the central leadership, he could be appointed as a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Hu Yaobang refused to "bow and scrape before the powerful" twice, saying: "I did not attack the central leadership. At that time, I was a member of the 'Eighth National Congress' Central Committee, and Jiang Qing was nothing, so how could it be said that I attacked the central leadership?"

    人格的力量
　　襟怀荡荡　蔑视权贵
    １９５２年耀邦同志调任团中央书记处书记。多年来，他襟怀坦白，坦坦荡荡做人。他刚到团中央工作时，便在宣布施政纲领时讲：“我的工作要是干得不好，你们就到党中央告状！”
    胡耀邦同志早就对康生那一套极左的思想路线很反感，早在延安时期耀邦担任总政组织部长时就不和康生交往。１９６６年８月３１日，中央文革领导小组派王力到团中央宣布罢一大批团干部的官，尽管康生当时担任中央文革小组顾问，可那天晚上，耀邦同志还是公开讲：“康生是老左。”并谈了对江青、王力等人的看法。
    党的“九大”前夕，耀邦作为“走资派”正接受批斗，周总理请示毛主席，要找几个年轻的“八大”中央委员担任“九大”中央委员，目标是胡耀邦和谭启龙两个“红小鬼”。
    “九大”时，康生主动伸出手来想和耀邦握手，耀邦扭头便走。结果，他没能担任“九大”中央委员。
    后来，团中央干部集体上书请愿，要求耀邦担任人大代表。汪东兴找他谈话并指出，只要你承认反对过中央领导同志，你就可以担任人大常委。胡耀邦绝不“摧眉折腰事权贵”，两次拒绝，他说：“我没有攻击中央领导同志。当时我是‘八大’中央委员，江青什么也不是，怎么说我攻击中央领导同志呢！”
