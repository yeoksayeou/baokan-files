The meeting with Master Tapies took place in a refined and elegant restaurant in Barcelona.

As a Spanish Catalan painter from Barcelona who, following Picasso, Miró, and Dalí, has had a world-wide impact on the Western art scene, Tapies held his first exhibition in Beijing in late April.

Tapies was born in 1923 in Barcelona into an open-minded and cultured wealthy family. He began painting at the age of 11 and read the works of philosophers like Nietzsche at an early age. The Spanish Civil War of 1936 and the various hardships that followed left a deep impression on him. At the age of 27, he held his first successful exhibition, and from then on, his career took off.

Our conversation focused on Eastern art. He seriously inquired about how many paintings were destroyed during the ten years of turmoil and which dynasties' paintings are now in the Forbidden City. It is thought-provoking that, at a time when Chinese artists are deeply uneasy about the limitations of traditional art in terms of expression, he sincerely believes that Western modern art cannot compare to Chinese classical art. He spoke with familiarity and respect about Shitao, Mi Fu, and the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou...

In his famous treatise "Painting and Void," Tapies quotes a famous line from Shitao's "Painting Language of the Bitter Gourd Monk": "A small scroll can encompass the heavens, the earth, mountains, and all things, yet the heart remains as tranquil as if it were nothing..." He believes that the essence of Eastern aesthetics, represented by Chinese classical painting and calligraphy, lies in the transition from "a tranquil heart" to "flying white," from the rules of "one stroke" to the "three mysteries of ink" or splashed ink. There is a complete tradition here, where the artist can truly grasp the essence of things through "the unrestrained spirit in the chest."

To a large extent, Tapies associates Eastern art with the "void" he advocates. He understands these two as "the space should be vast, the decoration should be minimal, the lines should be simple, and simplicity, even 'poverty,' is good." In terms of content, it is "to advocate that all moral norms and social conventions come from unrestrained life." He believes that the "void" in Eastern art can help resolve eternal conflicts at all levels. In his many works, people can not only taste his pursuit from various mysterious symbols, unrestrained splashes of color, and strongly contrasting spaces, but also, the standard Chinese seals that repeatedly appear in many of his paintings are a typical manifestation of the influence of Eastern art on his painting. He seems to particularly like to stamp seals with the characters "苦乐边" (bitter and sweet border) in different parts of the painting, sometimes even prominently placing them in the center of the painting. He told us, "I love Chinese calligraphy."

We also discussed a topic that has been controversial in China: the reasons for the emergence of modern abstract art. Tapies believes there are two main reasons. First, the development of modern technology has made people realize that the reality expressed by various artistic techniques in the past is not all of reality. Artists should strive to discover new things to make up for the shortcomings of science. Second, the reality presented by film and photography is more detailed and lifelike than any painting, forcing artists to seek new methods of expression to demonstrate their understanding of life and thus establish their own value. He emphasized that the great painters of the 20th century are all abstract artists, and they indeed have a problem of being understood by people.

Regarding holding an exhibition in China, Tapies believes it is an approach to a culture—at least to the classical Chinese culture that can be understood. He believes that "this culture, which has been a model for the West for several centuries, has always represented a precious example of the pursuit of truth and profound knowledge, as shown in its artistic masterpieces and poetic works."

　　塔皮埃斯与东方艺术
    蒋亚平
    同塔皮埃斯大师的会见，是在巴塞罗那一家雅致精巧的饭馆。
    作为继毕加索、米罗、达利之后又一位在西方画坛具有世界性影响的西班牙加泰罗尼亚画家，塔皮埃斯于４月下旬在北京第一次举办画展。
    塔皮埃斯１９２３年出生于巴塞罗那一个开明而有文化的殷实家庭，１１岁开始画画，很早就爱读尼采等哲学家的书。１９３６年的西班牙内战以及由此而引起的各种苦难，在他心中刻下深深的烙印。２７岁时他首次举办画展取得成功，自此一发不可收。
    我们的话题集中在东方艺术上。他认真地问到十年浩劫中毁了多少画，现在故宫里有哪些朝代的画。使人深思的是，正当中国艺术家对传统艺术在表现形式上的种种局限深感不安时，他却真诚地认为，面对中国古典艺术，西方现代艺术无法比拟。他熟悉而又尊重地谈到石涛、米芾、八大山人……
    塔皮埃斯在其著名的画论《绘画与虚无》中的题记，引用的就是石涛《苦瓜和尚画语录》中的名句：“尺幅管天地山川万物，而心淡若无者……”他认为以中国古典书画为代表的东方美学最精华的部分是从“清心静气”到“飞白”，从“一画”之规到“墨之三昧”或泼墨，其中有一个完整的传统，即艺术家能够依靠“胸中逸气”真正地抓住事物的本源。
    在很大程度上，塔皮埃斯将东方艺术同他所推崇的“虚无”联为一体。他将此二者理解为，形式上“空间要大，装饰要少，线条要简洁，以简约甚至‘贫乏’为好”。在内容上，则是“赞成所有道德准则与社会惯例都来自不受限制的生活。”他认为东方艺术中的这种“虚无”能在所有层次上帮助解决永恒的争端危机。在他众多作品中，人们不仅能从各种神秘的符号、无羁的泼彩、反差强烈的空间中体味到他的追求，而且，他的许多画中反复出现的标准的中国印章，更是东方艺术对他绘画影响的典型表征。他似乎特别喜爱在画的不同部位标上刻有“苦乐边”三字的篆刻，有时甚至让其鲜明地居于画的中央。他告诉我们：“我爱中国书法”。
    我们还谈到一个在中国争议颇多的问题，即现代抽象主义艺术作品产生的原因。塔皮埃斯认为有两个主要原因，一是现代科技的发展，使人们知道以前种种艺术手法所表现的现实并不是所有的现实，艺术家们应该通过自己的努力，去发现一些新的东西，以弥补科学之不足。二是电影和摄影表现的现实，比任何画都更为精细和逼真，迫使艺术家寻找新的表现手法以展示自己对人生的理解，以此确立自己的存在价值。他强调，２０世纪的大画家都是抽象派，他们确实有一个被人理解的问题。
    对于在中国举办画展，塔皮埃斯认为这是向一种文化——至少是能够了解到的中国古典文化——的接近。他认为，“这种文化若干世纪以来一直是西方的楷模，从艺术杰作以及诗词华章中表现出来的中国文化，始终代表着追求关于真实及其深刻知识的珍贵表率。”
