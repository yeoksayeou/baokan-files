The sudden surge of "migrant worker tide" has exposed the sharp contradictions in China's labor allocation. However, this is not the same as the "blind flow" of the past. It has distinct characteristics of the commodity economy development stage. With new mechanisms and policies, we can guide and transform them into a powerful force for resource development and wealth creation.

Early spring of 1989. Millions of farmers who came to the city to find work, like a surging spring tide, rose suddenly and then quickly receded, attracting attention and reflection.

Farmers' pursuit of wealth, cities' sluggish response

Two sets of figures are shocking: From 1952 to 1988, China's arable land decreased from over 1.5 billion mu to over 1.4 billion mu, while the rural labor force increased from 110 million to nearly 400 million!

A survey by relevant departments found that 40% of China's rural labor force are "hidden unemployed"!

However, for a long time, the vast majority of farmers would rather stay in their hometowns, even if it meant half-starving and basking in the sun. In their eyes, "crossing the pass to the east" and "going through the west pass" were desperate escapes, filled with unspeakable bitterness and tears, only the land of their hometown was the root of their survival.

It was rural reforms that solved the basic needs of the vast majority of farmers and broadened their horizons. Thus, more and more farmers bravely bid farewell to the land, either starting factories, engaging in commerce, or venturing into unfamiliar cities.

"Why do you want to come to the city?"

The workers' answers were almost the same: "Money is easier to make in the city!"

For the first time in China, there was a large-scale, voluntary migration of farmers seeking wealth, which is a significant historical progress! However, the city's response was quite sluggish. To the extent that during this year's peak of farmers entering the city, no department could accurately describe the basic situation of rural labor mobility.

Calling the farmers entering the city "blind flow," the city people are also quite "blind." However, in the past few years of rapid economic development, cities absorbed rural labor like a sponge absorbing water, and the city people's "blindness" did not hinder the overall situation. But since last year, the situation has changed dramatically:

— Economic tightening has made it difficult for many enterprises to provide new job opportunities, and some even need to lay off existing staff, "optimizing" the next batch;

— A large number of construction projects have been halted, causing rural construction workers in the city to be laid off en masse, with about a few million.

The dual pressure has caused the potential contradictions to surface. Farmers entering the city are like oil floating on water, unable to integrate.

Based on historical experience, city people naturally think: In the past, during difficult times, even city people had to be sent down to the countryside; now, during the tightening, shouldn't the farmers entering the city return to their hometowns?

The city did not hesitate to close the "city gates." Beijing, Guangzhou, and other cities issued notices to clean up and repatriate migrant workers.

People cannot help but ask: Can old methods solve new contradictions?

Rural areas are not without potential, and the greatest potential lies in policy

The power of the commodity economy has pushed a large number of farmers off the land, and now the city is ruthlessly pushing them back to the countryside.

What to do? It is obvious that they do not want to return to the narrow 1.4 billion mu of arable land and become "hidden unemployed" again.

As the main channel for transferring surplus labor, township enterprises have absorbed nearly 90 million people in the past 10 years, which is a remarkable achievement. However, they are also unable to absorb all the surplus labor in the countryside.

Is there no other way out? Yes, there is.

The country still has tens of billions of mu of wasteland that can be reclaimed, 11 billion mu of barren mountains and slopes suitable for afforestation, and over 6 billion mu of grassy mountains and slopes; nearly 100 million mu of freshwater surfaces and over 100 million mu of coastal tidal flats are also in a state of neglect. Experts estimate that developing these resources can absorb about 4 million rural laborers each year.

Strengthening rural infrastructure construction, including improving low-yield fields, water conservancy projects, implementing soil and water conservation work, building rural roads, and constructing and expanding drinking water projects, can also solve the employment of millions of surplus laborers each year.

Yang Jike, vice-chairman of the China Energy Research Society, believes that in the next 10 years, China can gradually develop the 140 million kW mountain hydropower resources in Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Hainan, and Anhui provinces. Through the construction of reservoirs and hydropower stations and the development of small hydropower, a large number of surplus laborers can be absorbed.

Some people have focused on the numerous courtyards in China's rural areas. It is estimated that the total area of rural courtyards in the country is at least as large as the arable land in two Zhejiang provinces. Developing high-yield courtyard economies can be done by every household. Last year, more than 110,000 households in Liaoning Province engaged in courtyard commodity production, with an average income of over 600 yuan per household.

Will farmers who have already developed a commodity economy consciousness be willing to return to their hometowns to engage in development-oriented production? This concern is not without reason. But as long as we guide them according to the situation and rely on the "invisible hand" of economic interests, rather than coercion, farmers will not be indifferent.

Of course, this requires financial support, technical services, material guarantees, and most importantly, policies that encourage various forms of development.

Hebei Yongqing County has a deep understanding of this. A few years ago, the county planned to develop the old course of the Yongding River. From the beginning, it formulated a policy of "giving first and taking later" and "hiding wealth in the people," stipulating that farmers can pay less or no agricultural tax in the initial stage of development and are exempt from agricultural and forestry special product tax. Farmers truly feel that engaging in development-oriented production is profitable, so they eagerly invest. In a few years, farmers in this county generously contributed nearly half of the total investment of 2.5 million yuan to establish joint or private small orchards, developing over 90,000 mu of wasteland.

Fujian, known as "eight mountains, one water, and one field," mainly relies on policies to mobilize nearly 20% of the rural labor force to "read the mountains and seas," developing over 3 million mu of barren mountains, beaches, and wasteland. Now, most areas are no longer worried about the employment of surplus labor.

The greatest potential lies in policy. Millions of farmers are eagerly awaiting it.

Both urban and rural areas are calling for a new type of labor market

The way out is not limited to rural areas.

An official from a relevant national department gave us an account: By the end of last year, the number of unemployed people in cities nationwide had reached 3 million, and by the end of this year, it might exceed 6 million. He believes that cities can no longer accommodate farmers entering the city.

However, in seemingly "impenetrable" Beijing, we also heard different voices:

— The textile industry in the city has been recruiting thousands of non-planned farmers to work on the production line as loom operators in recent years. If they are all dismissed according to the city's recent requirements, normal production will be difficult to maintain because city people are not willing to do this kind of work.

— The officials of the Municipal Public Works Bureau told us that due to the development of municipal construction and the natural reduction of the workforce, the bureau needs to increase at least 1,000 workers on the front line each year, but it is difficult to recruit even one person in the city. City people would rather be idle than go down the sewers or repair overpasses. If farmers are not allowed to be used, Beijing will be "paralyzed."

— The Municipal Construction Group Company predicts that to complete this year's construction plan, they will still need to increase the use of farmers....

Apparently different views actually outline the two aspects of China's urban employment situation: On the one hand, cities themselves have a considerable number of surplus laborers; on the other hand, in some hard, dirty, and tiring industries, there are still considerable employment "vacancies." And these "vacancies" are the battlefield for rural surplus laborers.

In addition to large cities, a large number of medium and small cities have more "vacancies." Exporting labor services abroad also has great potential.

In this sense, closing the city gates and adopting the "blocking" method can only be a temporary emergency measure. Long-term "blocking" also does not meet the needs of urban development. The fundamental solution is "guidance," opening up smooth channels for exchange, and establishing a unified urban-rural labor market.

"Isn't there already an existing labor market in the city?" Yes, in Beijing alone, there are 17 legal labor markets. However, surprisingly, these markets are almost exclusively open to city people. Most farmers entering the city still have no "market" to enter.

No "market" for labor, thus the spontaneous labor market emerges. Although they are repeatedly suppressed, they always "spring up again." And due to the lack of organization, these spontaneous markets cannot play their role well, and a few unscrupulous people take advantage of the chaos to do evil.

Reality calls for the birth of a new type of labor market. Here, farmers can timely understand the employment needs of the city, and city people can also have a more comprehensive understanding of the various aspects of farmers; here, relevant departments can scientifically control the flow and scale of farmers entering the city, and can also provide certain training for farmers entering the city; through it, farmers can find a new battlefield in the city. An organized market is an important way of diversion.

In fact, this new thing has already shown some buds: Hebei, Jiangsu, Henan, and other provinces have established relatively stable supply and demand relationships with some industries such as construction and services in large cities, and organize the supply of rural labor to employers; in Beijing and a few other large cities, some provinces or regions have established permanent institutions to specifically manage farmers entering the city....

However, the role of these scattered and small "channels" is limited, and the buds will not continue to grow without support. Establishing a unified labor market covering the whole country is impossible without the careful operation of a specialized department. Who should do this?! Farmers and city people are all looking forward to it.

The initially receding "migrant worker tide" shows that China's labor mobility has distinct characteristics of the commodity economy development stage: With the rise and fall of the economy, it will rise and fall like tides. If we do not start to establish the corresponding new mechanism, we will be caught off guard when the next tide rises. Farmers will also collide more fiercely with the city gates!

    突起的“民工浪潮”，暴露了我国劳力安排方面的尖锐矛盾；但它绝非昔日的“盲流”，而是带有商品经济发展阶段的明显特点，用新机制、新政策，因势利导，可以把他们转化为开发资源、创造财富的巨大力量
　　大潮初落之后
　　陈际阳　陈秋中　许宝健
    1989年初春。几百万进城找活干的农民，犹如一阵波涛汹涌的春潮，骤然兴起而又迅速回落，引起了人们的关注与思索。
    农民求富的涌动，城市的反应却相当迟钝
    两组数字，触目惊心：从1 952年到1988年，我国耕地面积从15亿多亩下降到14亿多亩，而农村的劳动力却从1.1亿上升到近4亿！
    有关部门抽样调查发现，我国农村劳动力中，有40％是“隐蔽的失业者”！
    但是，长期以来，绝大多数农民宁愿半饿肚子晒太阳，也不愿离开故土。在他们眼中“闯关东”、“走西口”是万不得已的逃生之路，充满了难言的辛酸与血泪，唯有故乡的土地才是生存的根。
    是农村改革，使绝大多数农民解决了温饱，更使他们开阔了眼界。于是，越来越多的农民勇敢地告别了土地，或办厂，或经商，或迈向陌生的城市。
    “你们为什么要进城？”
    民工的回答几乎一样：“城里钱好赚呗！”
    中国第一次出现了主动的、以赚钱求富为目标的大规模农民流动，这是了不起的历史性进步！但是城市的反应却相当迟钝。以致在今年农民进城的高峰中，没有哪个部门能够较为准确地说清楚农村劳动力流动的基本情况。
    说进城农民是“盲流”，实际城里人也“盲”得可以。不过，前几年经济高速发展，城市吸收农村劳力像海绵吸水，城里人“盲”点也无碍大局。而去年以来，形势大变：
    ——经济紧缩使不少企业难以提供新的就业岗位，有的还要裁减现有人手，“优化”下一批；
    ——大量建设项目下马，导致在城市的农村建筑工人大批走下脚手架，大约有几百万。
    双向夹击，潜在的矛盾一下子涌向表面。进城农民好象浮在水面的油，怎么也融不进去了。
    凭着历史的经验，城里人自然而然地想：过去困难时，连城里人都要下放、下乡；现在紧缩，进城农民还不该回乡吗？
    城市毫不迟疑地关闭了“城门”。北京、广州等市相继发出清理、遣返农民工的通知。
    人们不禁要问：用老办法解决新矛盾，能行吗？
    农村并非没有潜力，而最大的潜力是政策
    商品经济的力量把大批农民推出土地，如今，城市又毫不留情地要把他们推回农村。
    怎么办呢？显而易见，他们不愿意重新踏进那狭小的14亿亩耕地，重新作“隐蔽失业者”。
    作为转移剩余劳动力主渠道的乡镇企业，10年来，已吸纳了近9000万人，可谓功勋卓著。但是，它也无力把农村所有剩余劳力全部包揽下来。
    难道就别无出路？有，——
    全国尚有可垦荒地数亿亩，宜林荒山、荒坡11亿亩，草山、草坡6亿多亩；近亿亩淡水水面和上亿亩沿海滩涂，也有相当部分处于荒芜状态。专家估算，开发这些资源，每年可消化400万左右农村劳动力。
    加强农村基础设施建设，包括改造中低产田、水利工程、开展水土保持工作、修筑农村公路、建设和扩大饮用水工程，每年也可解决数百万剩余劳动力的就业问题。
    中国能源研究会副理事长杨纪珂则认为，在今后10年内，我国可以逐步开发江西、湖南、广东、福建、浙江、海南和安徽七个省的1400万千瓦山区水电资源，通过兴修水库和水电站，再通过利用小水电发展工副业，可以消化大量剩余劳动力。
    还有人把焦点对准我国农村众多的庭院。据估算，全国农村庭院总面积至少有两个浙江省的耕地面积那么大。发展高效益庭院经济，家家都可以干。去年，辽宁省就有110多万户农民从事庭院商品生产，户均收入600多元。
    已初具商品经济意识的农民能安心回乡搞开发性生产吗？这种担心不无道理。但只要因势利导，靠“看不见的手”——经济利益引路，而不是靠强迫命令，农民就不会无动于衷。
    当然，这需要资金扶持，需要技术服务，需要物资保障，而最需要的是鼓励多种形式开发的政策。
    河北永清县对此深有体会。几年前，这个县计划开发永定河故道，一开始就制定了先“予”后“取”、藏富于民的政策，规定农民在开发初期可少交或不交提留，还免交农林特产税。农民实实在在地感到搞开发性生产有利可图，于是纷纷踊跃投资。几年间，这个县农民大方地拿出占总投资近一半的250万元，建立合伙或私营小林果场，开发出9万多亩荒地。
    “八山一水一分田”的福建，也主要是靠政策调动近20％的农村劳力大念“山海经”，开发了300多万亩荒山、荒滩、荒地”。现在，多数地区已不为剩余劳动力出路发愁。
    最大的潜力，在政策。亿万农民翘首以待。
          城乡都在呼唤新型的劳务市场
    出路也并不仅限于农村。
    国家有关主管部门的一位干部给我们算了一笔帐：全国城市待业人员到去年底已达300万，到今年底，可能要超过600万。他认为，城市已无法容纳进城农民。
    但是，就在似乎已经“针插不进，水泼不入”的北京市，我们也听到了不同的声音：
    ——市纺织行业近年来一直招用几千名计划外农民工作第一线挡车工。若按市里最近的要求全部清退，正常生产难以维持。因为城里人不愿干这种活。
  ——市市政工程局的同志告诉我们，因市政建设的发展和职工队伍的自然减员，这个局第一线的工人每年至少要增加1000名，但在城里连一个人都难招到。城里人宁愿闲着，也不肯去钻下水道、修立交桥。如果不让用农民工，北京市得“瘫”了。
    ——市建工总公司则预言，要完成今年的工程计划，他们招用农民还得增加。……
    貌似不同的观点正好勾划出我国城市就业状况的两个侧面：一方面，城市本身存在着相当数量的过剩劳动力；另一方面，在某些苦、脏、累的行业，依然留有相当的就业“空白”。而这些“空白”正是农村剩余劳动力的用武之地。
    除大城市外，数量众多的中小城市还有更多的“空白”。向国外输出劳务，也大有可为。
    从这个意义上说，关闭城门，采取“堵”的方法只能应急于一时。长久“堵”，也不符合城市的发展需要。根本的办法是“导”，是开辟畅通的交流渠道，建立城乡一体化的劳务市场。
    “城里不是已经有现成的劳务市场吗？”是的，单北京，合法的劳务市场就有17个。但是，令人惊讶的是，这些市场几乎清一色地只向城里人开放。多数农民进城仍然无“市”可投。
    有“劳”无“市”，于是自发劳务市场应运而生。尽管它们一次又一次地遭到取缔，但总是“春风吹又生”。而由于缺乏组织，这些自发市场不能很好地发挥作用，少数心术不正之徒还瞅准空子，浑水作奸。
    现实呼唤着新型劳务市场的降生。在这里，农民能及时了解城市的就业需求，城里人也能较充分地了解农民各方面的底细；在这里，有关部门可以对进城农民的流向和规模进行科学的控制，还可以对进城农民进行一定的培训；通过它，农民可以到城里找到用武的新天地。有组织的市场是一个重要的疏导方式。
    事实上，这种新事物已经露出了点点萌芽：河北、江苏、河南等已与一些大城市中的建筑、服务等行业建立起了较稳定的供需关系，有组织地向用人单位输送农村劳力；在北京等少数大城市，一些省或地区建立了常设的机构，专门管理进城的农工……
    但是，分散、细微“渠道”的作用终究有限，萌芽无人扶持，也很难继续成长。建立能够覆盖全国的统一劳务市场，离开专门部门的精心操持，是根本不可能的。该谁来办这件事？！农民和城市人都在盼望着。
    初落的“民工浪潮”表明，我国的劳动力流动，已经带有明显的商品经济发展阶段的特点：随着经济的消长，它会像潮汐一样有规律地起落。如果再不着手抓紧建立相应的新机制，下一次涨潮时，我们依然会惊慌失措。农民则会更猛烈地撞击城市的大门！
