Reading and collecting books should be considered a "refined pursuit" or a noble activity. However, any matter in the world can become distorted under certain conditions, and book collecting is no exception.

More than ten years ago, Comrade A Ying's book collection was famous. Many rare and fine books from the Ming Dynasty were collected by him over more than fifty years from various places in the south and north, and from the midst of military campaigns. In the late 1950s, he moved to Beijing's Cotton Flower Lane. At that time, besides comrades like Li Yimang, Qi Yanming, and Xu Pingyu who often visited him, there was also a person with a Fujian accent who frequently borrowed Ming Dynasty books from Comrade A Ying.

During the Cultural Revolution, A Ying was detained in the "cow shed" at the Writers' Association. At that time, that influential Fujian person suddenly called the rebel faction at the Writers' Association, ordering them to send all of A Ying's books to a certain place for collection, "not allowing any loss." The rebels followed the order. Later, on a certain night, several trucks drove into that place, heavily guarded, and thus, in one night, A Ying's Ming Dynasty books were added to the bookshelves of the Fujian person and his few accomplices! Recently, I saw a Soviet documentary film "Ordinary Fascism," which made me recall the scene of the nationwide frenzy of "destroying the Four Olds" and burning line-bound books. In addition to the heart-wrenching and pitiful sight, I also suddenly thought of this incident.

Collecting books is a refined pursuit. Cultured Chinese readers especially like to stamp their beloved line-bound books with small red seals, on one hand indicating that these are their own books, and on the other hand adding to the decorative value of the pages. If it is a book from a famous predecessor, having a book collector's seal on it would further increase the book's value as an artifact. For example, a Song Dynasty edition book with the seal of Huang Pule from the Qing Dynasty, "Shi Li Ju" or "Bai Song Yi Jiao," would further increase the book's value, which is known to readers.

After this catastrophe, the Party and the government, according to policy, returned the Song, Ming, and ancient books that had been seized, but often, in addition to the original book collector's seals, there were a few more seals. According to what the author has seen, there is a white seal "Jiang Qing's Collection" (about three centimeters), often stamped on the cover or the "top of the page" (the blank space at the top of the page), which looks very domineering. There is also a red seal "Bo Da's Collection," with the same size and style. There is also a large seal "Wen Ling Chen Bo Da," seen on the returned books. Additionally, there is another family's white seal "Kang Sheng" imitating Han Dynasty small seals, less than one and a half centimeters. This seal is often stamped in an appropriate position, and at the same time, there is a red seal "Returned to the Public" stamped prominently, with the same size as the Han Dynasty name seal; surprisingly, there is also a seal "Great Public Spirit," stamped together with the name seal on the book. Those who see it cannot help but stick out their tongues.

Speaking of Jiang Qing's seal having "domineering spirit," there are many examples. A fine book with the seal of the Qing Dynasty book collector Liu Xihai was forcibly covered by a seal "Jiang Qing's Collection." This "drawing a hard bow" arrogant method will also be "unprecedented" when someone writes the history of Chinese book collecting.

In "Seven Flavors of Book Talk," this talk "belongs to what flavor"? The author also does not know, so let the reader taste it themselves. (Attached pictures)

　　藏书和藏书印
　　黄苗子
    读书和藏书应当属于一种“雅事”，或者叫做高尚行为。可是世界上任何事物都会因一定条件就异化，藏书也不例外。
    十多年前，阿英同志的藏书是有名的，许多明刻的珍、善本书，是他五十多年从南北各地、从戎马倥偬中辛勤搜购的。５０年代后期，他往北京棉花胡同，那时除了李一氓、齐燕铭、徐平羽等同志常去看他以外，还有一个福建口音的人，也常到棉花胡同借阅阿英同志的明版书。
    “文革”中，阿英在文联被关进“牛棚”。那时，那位炙手可热的福建人忽然给文联造反派去个电话，叫把阿英同志的所有藏书送到某处集中，“不许散失”。造反派遵命行事。后来在某一夜，几部汽车开进某处，警卫森严，于是一夜之间，阿英的明版书被归入福建人及其几个同伙的书架中！最近看到一部苏联拍的纪录片《普通法西斯》，使我回想起当年举国若狂的扫“四旧”、烧线装书的情景，在伤心惨目之余，忽然也想起此事。
    藏书是雅事，风雅的中国读书人，更喜欢在他心爱的线装书上盖上朱红小印，一方面表示这是本人的藏书，另方面增加了书页的装饰味道，如果是先代名家的藏书，上面有个藏书章，则更加增加了这本书的文物价值。例如一本宋版书，上面有清·黄丕烈“士礼居”或“百宋一鏖”的藏书印，那就更增加了书的声价，这是读书人都知道的。
    就在这场浩劫以后，党和政府按照政策，发还曾被掠夺的宋、明、古籍，却往往在原有的藏书家的印章之外，多了几方图章。据笔者所目睹的，有白文“江青藏书”（约三厘米），往往盖在封面显目处或“天头”（书页上面空白处）上，看来很有霸气。有朱文“伯达藏书”，大小风格和上面的相同。另有“温陵陈伯达印”大章一方，见于发还书上。此外另一家的白文“康生”仿汉小印，不到一厘米半。这方印往往盖得位置恰当，同时还赫然盖有“归公”朱文小印，大小与仿汉名章相同；出人意外的，更有一方“大公无私”的方印，与名章同时盖在书上。见者莫不伸出舌头。
    说江青盖的印“霸气”，例子是不少的。一本盖有清代藏书家刘喜海印章的善本书，却硬被一方“江青藏书之章”覆盖在刘印上面，此种“开硬弓”的蛮横手段，将来有人写中国藏书史时，也是“史无前例”的。
    在《七味书谭》中，这一谭“属于什么味”？笔者也搞不清楚，只好让读者自己去品尝了。（附图片）
