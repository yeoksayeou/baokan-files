Twenty years ago, Chinese people were only allowed to write "criticism" articles; now, Chinese people can also write love letters; twenty years ago, Chinese bookstores were filled with red "treasured books," now Chinese bookstalls are filled with popular novels and martial arts magazines...

These are certainly all changes, but they are not comparable. However, someone has lumped these together, all calling it "cultural decline." (See March 3, 1989, People's Daily, page 8, Yang Qun's "Hail the 'Contemporary Love Letter World Championship'!")

The article refers to "a certain domestic magazine," which, as far as I know, is the _Shidai_ magazine. Mr. Yang believes: "The Alley of Misfortune's Ah Q is no longer satisfied with just touching the 'greasy face' of the little nun and wants to learn from the pseudo-foreign devils to write love letters." He then solemnly asks: "Is this an innovation of 'thought liberation'? Or is it a sign of cultural decline?"

Facing such a serious question about the fate of national culture, I quickly found the issue of _Shidai_ that published the notice for the love letter competition. Looking through it, I did not find any self-proclaimed language about "thought liberation."

Mr. Yang views all the contestants as "Ah Qs" and criticizes them as not being "serious pursuers of love." This seems to be an insult to the public; even if all Chinese people are Ah Qs, writing love letters or wanting to learn to write love letters is still a step more civilized than "being satisfied with just touching the little nun's 'greasy face'." How can this be equated with "cultural decline"?

Does China have cultural decline? Yes, it does! But from the "treasured book" craze to the "popular" craze, it probably does not amount to "decline"; because when we were reading "treasured books," our hearts were not necessarily free from thoughts of "popular" things, so it is a change in reading tastes, with no slope to decline.

Love is an art, a sublime art, an art that all humanity should learn and explore together; love letters, as a form of expressing love, are the same. They mark the level of social civilization. This has nothing to do with Mr. Yang's discussion of the "exclusivity" and "exclusiveness" of love. Lu Xun's love letters to Xu Guangping, which were edited and published, did anyone prove from this that he was in "decline" or opposed to the exclusivity and exclusiveness of love? On the contrary, not needing love, not needing a noble expression of love, and only being satisfied with "touching the little nun's face" is what truly eliminates the exclusivity and exclusiveness of love.

I had the fortune to read a few love letters published in _Shidai_. They were full of sincerity, and between the lines, one could see the deep and beautiful young hearts. If Mr. Yang had also read them, perhaps he would not doubt the contestants' serious attitude towards pursuing love.

　　阿Ｑ·情书及其他
    ——与杨群先生讨论“文化滑坡”
    高山
    二十年前，中国人只允许写“大批判”稿；如今中国人也可以写情书了；二十年前，中国书店里是红一色的“宝书”，如今中国书摊上充斥着言情、武打之类的通俗小报……
    这固然都可归入变化之列，但却是不能相提并论之事。然而，偏偏有人把这风马牛扯在一起，统统称之为“文化滑坡”。（见３月３日《人民日报》八版杨群《盛哉，“当代情书世界大奖赛”！》）
    文中指的“国内某杂志”，据我所知系《时代》杂志。杨先生认为：“未庄的阿Ｑ，再也不满足于摸摸小尼姑的‘油腻腻的脸蛋’，一心想学假洋鬼子写起情书来。”并且煞有介事地问道：“这是‘思想解放’的创举？还是文化瘠土的滑坡？”
    面对如此有关民族文化命运的严肃发问，赶快翻出刊有情书大奖赛启事的那期《时代》，看破纸面，也未发现有“思想解放的创举”一类标榜言语。
    杨先生把参加比赛的投稿人统统视为“阿Ｑ”、斥作不是“严肃的爱的追求者”，是否有辱众之嫌；就算中国人都是阿Ｑ，写写情书，或者想学学写情书，总比“满足于摸摸小尼姑‘油腻腻的脸蛋’”更文明了一步吧，怎能与“文化滑坡”划上等号？
    中国可有文化滑坡？曰：有！但从“宝书”热到“通俗”热恐怕尚够不上“滑坡”；因为那时读“宝书”之际，我们心里未必就不想“通俗”之类，所以是读书趣味的变化，无坡可滑。
    爱是一种艺术，崇高的艺术，人类应该共同学习、共同探讨的艺术；情书作为一种爱的表达方式亦如此，她标明社会文明的程度。这与杨先生谈的爱的“专一性”与“排他性”毫不相干。鲁迅先生把写给许广平的情书编辑出版，又有谁因此证明出他是在“滑坡”、是反对爱的专一性？相反，不需要爱，不需要爱的高尚表达，只满足于“摸摸小尼姑的脸蛋”，才是抹杀了爱的专一性和排他性。
    我有幸读了几篇发表在《时代》上的情书，满篇真诚，字里行间可见深挚美好的年轻心灵。倘若杨先生也读过，恐怕他就不会怀疑投稿人追求爱的严肃态度了。
