The Soviet Union is building a new aircraft carrier at the Southern Shipyard in Nikolaev. This will be the Soviet Union's third aircraft carrier.

According to the latest issue of the British magazine *Jane's Defence Weekly*, the Soviet Union has confirmed that it is building a new aircraft carrier. The report quotes Soviet Rear Admiral Kuklev as saying that the main task of the Soviet Union's third aircraft carrier is air defense rather than offense. The aircraft on board are fighters rather than bombers and do not have the capability to attack land targets.

Rear Admiral Kuklev added, "The Soviet Union's aircraft carriers are basically designed to protect transport ships and convoys, and the types and numbers of aircraft they carry also reflect this."

　　苏建造第三艘航空母舰
    新华社伦敦4月10日电　据最新一期英国《简氏防务周刊》报道，苏联已证实，他们正在尼古拉耶夫造船南厂建造一艘新的航空母舰。这将是苏联的第三艘航空母舰。
    报道引用苏联库克廖夫少将的话说，苏联第三艘航空母舰的主要任务是防空而不是进攻，舰载“作战飞机是歼击机而不是轰炸机，不具备陆地攻击的能力”。
    库克廖夫少将还补充说，“苏联的航空母舰原则上都是根据保护运输船只和护航的要求设计的，其舰载飞机的型号和数量也可说明这一点。
