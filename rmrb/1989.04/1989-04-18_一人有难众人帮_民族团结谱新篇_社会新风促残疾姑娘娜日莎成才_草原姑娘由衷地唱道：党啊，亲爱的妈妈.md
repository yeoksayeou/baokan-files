One in Difficulty, All Come to Help; Ethnic Unity Writes a New Chapter
Social Winds Help Disabled Girl Narsai Achieve Success
A Girl from the Grasslands Sings from the Heart: Party, Dear Mother

    This spring, a Mongolian girl named Narsai, who uses a wheelchair, participated in the performance of the second National Disabled Persons' Art Festival held at the Great Hall of the People. This girl, who has suffered misfortune since childhood, will never forget the warmth and love of society. She sang her favorite song, "Party, Dear Mother," with her rich and mellow voice.

    Twenty years ago, a girl named Narsai, not yet two years old, accidentally fell into a boiling milk pot on the grasslands of Inner Mongolia's Xilingol League. Her right side and right leg were severely burned, and her mother, seeing the tragic scene, was shocked into mental illness. At that time, her father was also sent to labor reform for a fabricated political issue. Little Narsai, this innocent and small life, endured immense suffering. The burns repeatedly became infected, and Narsai's small and frail body curled up in pain.

    After Narsai was sent to the Inner Mongolia Hospital, she received care from the old nurse Zhang Qingfen, who treated her like a mother. During the nine years Narsai was in the hospital, Zhang Qingfen would find time every day to go to Narsai's bedside to wash her face, comb her hair, and change her clothes. During more than ten surgeries, Zhang Qingfen would sit by her side all night. During intravenous drips, to prevent infection, Zhang Qingfen would hold Narsai's leg with her hands.

    Narsai also received deep care from a Han Chinese woman, Ban Shuzhi, a worker at the Inner Mongolia Second Wool Textile Mill, who was a stranger to her. Ban Shuzhi often found time to visit Narsai in the hospital, bringing her food and knitting sweaters and pants for her. On the day Narsai underwent an amputation surgery, Ban Shuzhi and Zhang Qingfen waited outside the operating room for more than three hours, and after the surgery, they guarded Narsai for three days and three nights.

    Finally, Narsai was discharged from the hospital, but her own family was unable to take care of her. At that time, Ban Shuzhi's husband's salary was less than 100 yuan, and they had three children. Despite their difficult circumstances, they adopted Narsai.

    Narsai's right arm and waist were fused together, and her body was severely deformed, requiring surgery in Beijing. At that time, Ban Shuzhi's eldest daughter was taking the entrance exam for a vocational school, and her youngest daughter was taking the high school entrance exam. "Treating Narsai's illness is more important!" Ban Shuzhi gritted her teeth and set off with Narsai.

    From spring to deep autumn in 1984, Narsai received active and effective treatment at Beijing's Jishuitan Hospital, undergoing three relatively complex corrective and skin graft surgeries. The surgeries were too taxing on her body, so Ban Shuzhi found ways to increase Narsai's nutrition. Chicken, eggs, and meat were ensured for every meal, along with fresh fruits and beef jerky that Narsai loved. She prepared various dishes for Narsai, but she herself often ate pickled vegetables, saving as much money as possible.

    Narsai spent six years in the home of her Han Chinese mother, Ban Shuzhi. Her brothers, sisters, and younger sister treated her like a family member. Her Han Chinese mother sent her to school and taught her to read and write. She loved to draw and sing, and her family created conditions for her to learn. Now, Narsai can draw beautiful watercolor paintings. She also won a special award in the Hohhot City Singer (Amateur Group) Television Competition.

    Narsai encountered misfortune at a young age. However, she received love from society and was happy. The state bore all of Narsai's medical expenses. Narsai's unfortunate life was bathed in the sunlight and dew of deep affection.

　　一人有难众人帮　民族团结谱新篇
　　社会新风促残疾姑娘娜日莎成才
　　草原姑娘由衷地唱道：党啊，亲爱的妈妈
    本报讯　今年初春的一天，坐着轮椅的蒙古族少女娜日莎参加了在首都人民大会堂举行的第二届全国残疾人艺术调演的演出。这个从小就遭遇不幸的草原姑娘，忘不了社会的温暖和厚爱。她用那宽厚圆润的歌声唱出了多年来心中最喜爱的歌——《党啊，亲爱的妈妈》。
    ２０年前，内蒙古锡林郭勒草原上不满两岁的娜日莎，不慎掉进了熬奶茶的开水锅里，身体右侧和右腿严重烫伤，妈妈见此惨状惊吓得得了精神病。当时爸爸又因莫须有的政治问题被劳动改造。娜日莎这个幼小而无辜的生命承受着巨大的折磨，烫伤反复感染，娜日莎又瘦又小的躯体因巨痛蜷缩成一团。
    小娜日莎被送进内蒙古医院后，受到老护士张清芬慈母般地照料。在娜日莎住院的９年里，张清芬每天抽空到娜日莎的病床前给她洗脸、梳头，帮她换洗衣服；十多次大小手术，张护士都是整夜整夜地坐在她身边；输液时怕伤口感染，张清芬用双手轮换地托着孩子的腿。
    娜日莎还得到素不相识的汉族妇女、内蒙古第二毛纺织厂工人班淑芝的深切关怀。班淑芝时常抽空来医院看娜日莎，给她送吃的，给她织毛衣、毛裤。娜日莎做截肢手术那天上午，班淑芝和张清芬在手术室外等了３个多小时，手术后整整守护了娜日莎３天３夜。
    娜日莎终于出院了，可她自己的家却没有能力照顾她。当时班淑芝夫妇的工资不足１００元，家里有３个孩子，尽管家境困难，仍收养了娜日莎。
    娜日莎的右胳膊和腰部粘连在一起，身体严重畸形，需到北京再做手术。当时，班淑芝的大女儿正考中专、小女儿考高中。“给娜日莎治病更要紧！”班淑芝咬了咬牙，带着娜日莎上路了。
    从１９８４年春天到深秋，娜日莎在北京积水潭医院得到了积极有效的治疗，做了３次比较复杂的矫形、植皮手术。手术消耗体力太厉害，班淑芝想着法子给娜日莎增加营养。鸡、蛋、肉保证顿顿有，还有娜日莎爱吃的新鲜水果、牛肉干，她变着花样给娜日莎做饭吃。可她自己却常啃咸菜，尽可能地节省点钱。
    娜日莎在汉族妈妈班淑芝的家里度过了６个春秋。哥哥、姐姐和妹妹待她亲如手足。汉族妈妈送她上学，教她读书写字。她喜欢画画、唱歌，家里就为她创造了学习的条件。如今，娜日莎已能画漂亮的水彩画。她还在呼和浩特市歌手（业余组）电视大奖赛上获得了特别奖。
    娜日莎很小就遇到了不幸。然而，她得到了社会的爱，她又是幸福的。国家负担了娜日莎的全部医疗费。娜日莎不幸的人生沐浴着挚爱的阳光和雨露。
