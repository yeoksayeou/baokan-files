Art and science are like two magnificent fruits on the tree of culture. Throughout the several thousand years of human history, science and art have flourished and declined together. They have been united and harmonized on the basis of their shared relationship with nature and their pursuit of "beauty."

Science needs art, and art needs science. Art makes science appear charming, while science provides the necessary conditions for art to achieve perfection. In the process of human social and cultural development, science and art advance hand in hand like two sisters. We observe that in the same historical period, regions where science and technology thrive are often places where artistic talents congregate. In the history of a nation, periods of artistic brilliance are often also times of technological advancement. Examples include ancient China's Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, ancient Greece two thousand years ago, Italy during the Renaissance, 18th-century Britain, and 19th-century France, all of which exhibit these characteristics.

The fusion of science and art often occurs through technology. In every era, the scientific and artistic achievements of the time, once combined, form a unified, orderly, and harmonious organism, thereby providing people with aesthetic enjoyment and becoming a powerful and subtle force driving societal progress. Today, the splendid civilization that humanity possesses not only embodies the essence of artistic creation over thousands of years but also radiates the brilliance of scientific and technological advancements. The Ding, a large bronze vessel from the Shang Dynasty in China, is a masterpiece in the history of world bronze casting. It not only represents the technological level of bronze smelting in ancient China but also signifies the artistic achievements of the Shang Dynasty. The European Renaissance was a great era when science and art reached a high level of integration. One of its distinctive features was that many scholars with extensive knowledge exhibited multifaceted creative talents. Leonardo da Vinci, an Italian painter, was a prominent representative of this group. He was not only a great artist but also a scientific giant. People therefore praised him as "a scientist in art and an artist in science." Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the great German poet who spanned the 18th and 19th centuries, was also such a person. His 1790 essay "The Metamorphosis of Plants" was a crystallization of his scientific and artistic talents. Zhang Heng, the great scientist of the Han Dynasty in China who invented the seismograph, was the author of the famous ancient poem "Fu on the Two Capitals." As for Albert Einstein, the 20th-century scientific giant, his skill in playing the violin is well-known. In Einstein's view, the reason why science and art are interconnected is that both rely on a rich imagination. He repeatedly emphasized: "Imagination is more important than knowledge." The imagination in art often stimulates the imagination necessary for scientific creation, while the imagination in science gives artistic imagination even more beautiful wings. Those who possess both scientific and artistic talents are extraordinary individuals who stride forward with one foot in the world of art and the other in the world of science.

Understanding and recognizing the kinship between science and art, and paying attention to their complementary roles, is of great significance for strengthening cultural construction and promoting the prosperity of cultural and artistic endeavors. Some of our comrades do not fully understand this issue and fail to see the mysterious relationship between art and science. When we strive to develop stage art, if we focus only on the actors' performances and neglect or even forget the application of stage technology, we often do not achieve the best results. Therefore, to continually liberate the productive forces of art, we must consciously build a bridge between science and art; let them "marry" in the "rainbow" and advance together. As the French writer Gustave Flaubert said: "The further we progress, the more art needs to be scientific, and science also needs to be artistic. They part ways at the base of the tower but reunite at the top." Only by truly achieving this can we make our art continually reach new heights.

　　艺术与科学的亲缘关系
    高占祥
    艺术与科学如同一棵文化之树上结出的两个硕果。在几千年的人类历史长河中，科学与艺术荣枯相依，兴衰与共，它们在与自然共同有关的基础上，在对“美”的追求中，得到了有机的统一和结合。
    科学需要艺术，艺术需要科学。艺术使科学显示出可爱的魅力，科学为艺术提供了日臻完美的必要条件。在人类社会文明发展的进程中，科学与艺术就像一对亲姐妹手拉手地前进。我们看到：在同一历史时代，科学技术昌盛之地，往往也是艺术人才密集之邦；在同一民族的历史上，艺术取得辉煌成就的时期，往往也是科技发展的黄金时期。如中国上古时的春秋战国，两千年前的古希腊，文艺复兴时期的意大利，１８世纪的英国，１９世纪的法国等，都体现出这样的特征。
    科学与艺术的结合常常是以技术为中介的。无论在什么时代，代表着当时水平的科学与艺术一经汇合，便形成统一、有序与和谐的有机体，从而给人以美的享受，并能成为推动社会前进的一种巨大而又巧妙的力量。今天，人类所拥有的灿烂文明，不仅凝聚着人类千百年来艺术创造的精华，也放射着科学技术的光辉。中国商代的司母戊大方鼎作为世界青铜史上的杰作，既体现了当时中国青铜冶炼的技术水平，又标志着商代艺术的辉煌成就。欧洲文艺复兴时代是人类历史上科学与艺术达到高度结合的伟大时代，其显著特征之一就在于许多知识渊博的学者身上表现出多才多艺的创造才能。意大利画家达·芬奇就是他们当中的一位杰出代表。他既是艺术大师，又是科学巨匠。人们由此而称赞他是“科学上的艺术家，艺术上的科学家”。横跨１８和１９世纪的德国伟大诗人歌德也是如此。１７９０年他发表的诗体论文《植物的演变》，便是其科学才能与艺术才能的结晶。我国汉代发明地动仪的大科学家张衡，是脍炙人口的千古名篇《二京赋》的作者。至于２０世纪科学泰斗爱因斯坦擅长演奏小提琴的佳话，更是众人皆知。在爱因斯坦看来，科学与艺术之所以相通，即在于两者均以丰富的想象力为心理背景。他一再强调：“想象力比知识更重要。”艺术的想象力，往往会刺激科学创造所必需的想象力；而科学的想象力，又会给艺术的想象力插上更加美丽的翅膀。那些集科学与艺术才能于一身的“能人”，则是左脚踏着艺术世界、右脚踏着科学世界前进的奇才。
    了解和认识科学与艺术的亲缘关系，并注意发挥二者的互补作用，对于加强文化建设、繁荣文化艺术事业具有重要意义。我们有些同志对这个问题认识得不够，看不到艺术与科学之间所具有的奇妙关系。当我们致力于发展舞台艺术之时，如果只注重演员的表演而不注重乃至忘记舞台科技的应用，往往收不到最佳效果。因此，要不断解放艺术生产力，就要自觉地架起科学与艺术之“虹”；让二者在“虹”中“联婚”，携手前进。正如法国作家福楼拜所说：“越往前进，艺术越要科学化，同时科学也要艺术化。二者从塔基分手，回头又在塔尖结合。”只有真正做到了这一点，才能使我们的艺术不断登上新的高峰。
