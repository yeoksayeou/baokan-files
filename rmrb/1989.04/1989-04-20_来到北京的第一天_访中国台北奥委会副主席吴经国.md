In the evening of April 20, at the welcoming banquet for the 4th Asian Youth Gymnastics Championships, Wu Jingguo, the representative of International Olympic Committee Chairman Juan Antonio Samaranch, was surrounded by journalists from home and abroad. He smiled broadly and said, "I have only been in Beijing for one day, but if I have to describe my feelings, it would be just two words: 'Excited.'"

This vice chairman of the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee said he was first excited about the significant breakthrough in sports exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. Mr. Wu Jingguo said that this was just a good beginning. In the future, not only will more athletes from Chinese Taipei come to the mainland to compete, but after overcoming some obstacles, athletes from the mainland will also go to Taiwan to show their skills.

That morning, he visited famous landmarks such as Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City, and the Temple of Heaven. Wu Jingguo told the Taiwanese reporters who interviewed him, "The feeling of being among the highest achievements of Chinese classical architecture is something you probably can't experience, because I am from a background in architecture."

During the Seoul Olympics last year, the reporter had interviewed Mr. Wu Jingguo, and they had agreed to meet in Beijing. When he recognized the reporter at the Great Hall of the People, he happily said, "I really didn't expect to meet so soon!" He then talked again about his wishes: to visit his ancestral home in Suzhou, to see his uncle, aunt, and cousin in Shanghai. He planned to spend three days to fulfill his long-held wishes.

　　来到北京的第一天    
    ——访中国台北奥委会副主席吴经国
    ４月２０日晚，在第四届亚洲青年体操锦标赛欢迎宴会上，被中外记者团团围住的国际奥委会主席萨马兰奇的代表吴经国先生满脸堆笑地说：“我到北京仅仅一天时间，如果说感受，只有两个字：‘兴奋’。”
    这位中国台北奥委会副主席说，他首先为海峡两岸体育交流的重大突破而兴奋。吴经国先生说，其实，这只是一个良好的开端，今后，不仅将有更多的中国台北选手来大陆参赛，在继续突破一些障碍后，大陆选手也一定会到台湾去大显身手。
    当天上午，他参观了天安门、故宫、天坛等名胜。吴经国先生对采访他的台湾记者说：“我置身在中国古典建筑艺术的最高成就之间的那种心情，恐怕是你们无法体验的，因为我是搞建筑出身的。”
    在去年汉城奥运会时，记者曾采访过吴经国先生，当时曾相约在北京见面，当他在人民大会堂认出记者后，高兴地说：“真没想到这么快就见面了！”他又重新谈起当初自己所说的几个心愿：回苏州老家省亲；探望在上海的大伯父、七姑、大舅。他计划用三天时间去实现自己的夙愿。
