Nanjing Takes Hard Measures to Stop Dropouts Among Primary and Secondary School Students

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, April 27 (Reporter Wang Huitao) Whether state-owned, collective enterprises, or individual economies, from now on, if any of them hire a child laborer or a dropout, their business license will be revoked. This is a hard measure taken by Nanjing City to control the dropout phenomenon.

Currently, Nanjing City has 40,000 dropouts, accounting for 5% of the total number of primary and secondary school students.

According to Zhang Lianfa, Director of the Nanjing Municipal Education Bureau, other measures taken by Nanjing City to control the dropout phenomenon include requiring each school to send staff to visit students' families to promote the Compulsory Education Law, and strengthening guidance for students with poor academic performance. They should not be discriminated against.

　　南京采取硬性措施制止中小学生流失
    新华社南京四月二十七日电（记者王惠堂）无论国营、集体企业，还是个体经济，今后只要招收一名童工或流失生，就要被吊销营业执照。这是南京市为控制流失生现象所采取的一项硬性措施。
    目前，南京市共有四万名流失生，占中小学生总数的百分之五。
    据南京市教育局局长张连发介绍，南京市控制流失生现象的其他措施还有，要求各个学校派人上门向学生家长宣传义务教育法，同时加强对学习成绩差的学生的辅导，不应歧视他们。
