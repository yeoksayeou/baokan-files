	One Should Have a Healthy Mindset
	—An Interview with Sichuan People's Congress Representative and President of Southwest University of Finance and Economics, Liu Shibai
	By Gao Xinqing, People's Daily Reporter

	National People's Congress Representative and economist Liu Shibai told the reporter, “I believe that whether it is rectification and adjustment, curbing inflation, or deepening reform, one should have a healthy mindset.”

	Liu Shibai pointed out that rectification and adjustment have just begun. The overheated economy has not yet cooled down, and the problem of excessive demand is far from being solved. Yet, some people think that the tightening measures will soon pass, and “everything will be bright by the fifteenth of August.” Liu Shibai said, “The quick-fix theory in reform is wrong, and the quick-fix theory in rectification is also inappropriate. Because the accumulated problems are numerous, solving them will take time. From the actual situation, everyone is looking left and right, making a lot of noise but little rain. Everyone is afraid to be the first to act and afraid to make fundamental changes. Therefore, at present, the leadership must have the determination to carry out rectification and adjustment and must not miss the opportunity to hastily end the campaign or go through the motions.”

	“Another mindset is that many people are concerned about their own accounts. For example, workers care about prices and wages; some specialized households hope for another price increase to make more money; factory directors care about the development of their enterprises, seeking more loans and investments; some local government leaders, to protect local finances, hesitate and observe the situation regarding the reduction of construction projects. They still want to continue with small textile mills, small breweries, and small tobacco factories. Meanwhile, coastal regions continue to demand policy relaxation and special treatment.”

	Liu Shibai believes that if everyone starts from their own perspective and is unwilling to touch their own interests; if everyone only calculates their own “small accounts” and is unwilling to consider the “national chessboard” of the whole country, how can such a mindset unify thoughts and actions?

	The reporter asked, “What kind of mindset do you think we should have?” Liu Shibai said, “Many countries in the world, in the process of achieving modernization, attach great importance to cultivating a national mindset of hard work and struggle, advocating for the coordination of interests among all parties in enterprise spirit and enterprise culture; emphasizing the positive factors of national culture to provide spiritual support for the country's modernization. Shouldn't we, in building socialist modernization, also focus on these aspects? The emergence of unhealthy mindsets cannot be blamed solely on the people. The problem lies in the fact that the officials' conduct is not upright. If the officials are clean in their governance, the people's customs will be honest and upright.”

### 应该有一个健康的心态——访四川人大代表、西南财经大学校长刘诗白

　　应该有一个健康的心态
    ——访四川人大代表、西南财经大学校长刘诗白
    本报记者  高新庆
    全国人大代表、经济专家刘诗白对记者说：“我以为无论是治理、整顿，抑制通货膨胀，还是深化改革，都应该有一个健康的心态。”
    刘诗白指出，治理、整顿只不过刚刚开始，经济过热需要降温的还未降下来，需求过旺的问题也远未解决，有的人却认为紧缩很快就会过去，“八月十五放光明”。刘诗白说：“改革上的速成论是不对的，在治理上的速效论也是不妥的。因为积累的问题比较多，解决起来需要时日。从实际情况看，各地都在左顾右盼，雷声大雨点小，都怕打头炮，都怕伤筋动骨。所以，当前，领导上要树立治理整顿的决心，决不能贻误时机草草收兵走过场。”
    “再一个心态，不少人关心自己的一本账。比如说，职工关心物价、工资；某些专业户盼望再涨价，多赚钱；厂长关心企业发展，争取多贷款、多投资；一些地方政府首脑为保地方财政，对压缩基建犹豫观望，什么小纺织、小酒厂、小烟厂还要继续上；而沿海地区，则继续要求放宽政策，特殊照顾。”刘诗白认为，如果都从自己的角度出发，不愿触动自己的利益；都算自己的“小帐”，不愿算“全国一盘棋”的“大帐”，这种心态怎么能统一思想，步调一致呢？
    记者问：“你认为应该有什么样的心态？”刘诗白说，世界许多国家在实现现代化中，都十分重视培育一种艰苦创业、奋斗进取的国民心态，提倡各方利益相协调的企业精神和企业文化；重视发掘民族文化的积极因素，为本国现代化提供精神支柱。难道我们搞社会主义现代化，不更应该在这些方面下功夫？不健康的心态的产生，不能一味责怪老百姓，民风不正在于官风不正。为政清廉，民风就会敦厚。
