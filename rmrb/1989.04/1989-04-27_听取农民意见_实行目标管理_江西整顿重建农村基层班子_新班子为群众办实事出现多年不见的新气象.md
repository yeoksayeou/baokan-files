Jiangxi province has introduced a competitive mechanism in the construction of rural grassroots teams, reorganizing and rebuilding village-level teams to enhance the vitality of rural areas.

Over the past year, Jiangxi province has started from the actual situation in rural areas. Facing the paralysis or semi-paralysis of some grassroots village-level teams, they have adopted the principles of "open, democratic, equal, and select the best" to establish village public offices. They have fully listened to the opinions of farmers and used a recruitment method to determine the candidates for village cadres, implementing full target management and signing responsibility contracts with townships. They have also stipulated that each village should have 3 to 5 members, elected by villagers to form the village-level leadership team. Cities like Yingtan and Fengcheng have also sent national and township cadres to work in the villages. The remuneration for village cadres is implemented through a unified subsidy and is linked to the economic benefits of the village. Since the number of village cadres has been significantly reduced, their remuneration is no longer fully borne by the farmers, thus reducing the farmers' burden by about 40%.

After reorganization and rebuilding, the average age of the new village cadres is below 40, and their educational level is at least junior high school. Before the adjustment in Fengcheng City, there were 12 illiterate village party secretaries and no college graduates. Now, 71% have a high school education or above, with 34 college graduates.

The reorganized and rebuilt village-level teams actively serve the farmers, winning their support and promoting the development and implementation of various rural works. Since last year, Nanfeng County has seen 1.4 million laborers working on water conservancy projects and developing 38,000 mu of barren hills, a scene not seen in many years. In Xinjian County, after more than a year of establishing village-level teams, the number of township, village, and household enterprises, as well as private enterprises, has reached 15,000, and 6 impoverished townships have bid farewell to poverty. While developing the commodity economy, rural gambling, fighting, illegal logging, and feudal superstitions, which were previously unmanaged, are now overseen by the village public offices.

　　听取农民意见　实行目标管理    
    江西整顿重建农村基层班子    
    新班子为群众办实事出现多年不见的新气象
    本报南昌电  记者赵相如报道：江西省在农村基层班子建设中引入竞争机制，整顿重建村级班子，增强了农村的生机和活力。
    去年以来，江西省从农村实际情况出发，针对一些基层村级班子瘫痪或半瘫痪状态，采取“公开、民主、平等、择优”的原则，组建村公所。他们在充分听取农民意见的基础上，用招聘的方式确定村干部人选，全部实行目标管理，与乡镇签订责任状，并规定每个村设编３至５名，由村民选举产生村级领导班子。鹰潭市、丰城市等地市还把国家干部和乡镇干部派到村里去任职。村级干部报酬实行统筹补贴，并与村里的经济效益挂起钩来。由于村干部大为减少，村干部的报酬不再全由农民摊派，农民的负担大致可减轻４０％左右。
    经过整顿和重建的村级领导班子，新任的村干部平均年龄降到了４０岁以下，文化水平均达到初中以上。丰城市调整前村支书中有１２名文盲，没有１名大专生，如今高中以上文化的占７１％，还有大中专毕业生３４人。
    整顿和重建的村级班子积极为农民办实事，因而受到农民的欢迎，推动了农村各项工作的开展和落实。去年下半年以来，南丰县出现了１４０万劳力上阵修水利、开发荒山３．８万多亩的多年不见的新气象。新建县村级班子建立１年多，全县乡、村和户办企业、私营企业发展到１．５万个，６个特困乡告别了贫困。在发展商品经济的同时，农村赌博斗殴、乱砍滥伐、封建迷信等不良现象以前无人管，现在也由村公所管起来了。
