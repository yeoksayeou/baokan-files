On March 30, the Liberation Army Literature and Art Publishing House, the Cultural Department of the Jinan Military Region, and the *Novel Selection* magazine jointly held a discussion on Miao Changshui's works in Beijing. Miao Changshui's novels *Season Bridge*, *The Difference Between Winter and Summer*, and *The Son of the Dyeing House* are all set against the backdrop of the war-torn life in the old revolutionary base area of Mount Yi. They depict the warmth of interpersonal relationships and the bitterness of survival in the harsh conditions of war. The attending critics praised the author for sincerely writing about life and human emotions amidst the various noisy and chaotic artistic competitions. They described his novels as a pure and heartfelt elegy in the world of literature.

　　苗长水作品讨论会
    ３月３０日，解放军文艺社、济南军区文化部和《小说选刊》杂志社联合在京召开苗长水作品讨论会。苗长水的《季节桥》、《冬天与夏天的区别》、《染房之子》等中、短篇小说都是以老区沂蒙山战斗生活为背景，描写在严酷的战斗生活中人际关系的温馨和生存状态的苦涩。与会评论家称，作家在各种喧嚣纷乱的艺术竞争中，真诚地写人生、写人情，是小说世界中一曲纯情幽怀的咏叹调。
