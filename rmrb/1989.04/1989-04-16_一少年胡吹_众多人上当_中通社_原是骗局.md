A 17-year-old student, Wang Changyong, used a privately carved seal to establish the "China Youth News Agency," deceiving a group of fellow students who aspired to become journalists and swindling them out of their money.

Wang Changyong, from Tunliu County in Shanxi Province, had been expelled from school twice for stealing school property. In September 1987, he enrolled in Changzhi Vocational Middle School, falsely claiming that his great-grandfather was Wang Bikun, the former deputy director of the Shanxi Provincial Propaganda Department. He also impersonated himself as the director of the East China Six Provinces and One Municipality Youth Federation and the deputy director of the Shanxi branch of the China Youth Journalists Association. In July 1988, he left school without permission and went to Beijing, using the privately carved seal to draft various fake documents and deceive people everywhere. A notice from the "China Youth News Agency" titled "Regarding the Recruitment of Youth Journalists and Correspondents" required applicants to pay a registration fee of 25 yuan for journalists and 21 yuan for correspondents. Wang Changyong received a large number of remittances from all over the country.

On February 1, this year, Wang Changyong borrowed a hall in Beijing to hold the "China Youth News Agency" inauguration ceremony, announcing himself as the first president and a certain celebrity as the honorary president, with more than 50 renowned figures from the news, education, and arts circles as advisors. However, many senior comrades were unaware of this. (Our newspaper mistakenly published the inauguration ceremony news on February 2. We apologize to our readers.—Editor)

Wang Changyong is only 17 years old, and in the eyes of many, he is still just a child, but his activities are astonishing. Wang Changyong is responsible for his own actions, but what responsibility should society bear?

The public security authorities are currently investigating Wang Changyong's case.

　　一少年胡吹　众多人上当
　　“中通社”原是骗局
    本报讯　一名１７岁的中学生王长永仅靠一枚私刻的公章，成立“中国中学生通讯社”，骗取了一批梦想当记者的同龄人的钱财。
    来自山西省屯留县的王长永曾因盗窃学校公物等原因，两次被学校开除。１９８７年９月，他又来到长治市职业中学插班，谎称自己的曾祖父是原山西省委宣传部副部长王毕昆，冒充自己任华东六省一市中学生文联理事、中国中学生记者团山西分社副社长等职。１９８８年７月，他擅自离校来到北京，利用私刻的公章，起草各种假文件，到处招摇欺骗。一份“中通社”《关于发展中学生记者、通讯员的通知》中要求，报名的记者、通讯员分别交纳２５元和２１元的手续费。王长永收到来自全国各地的大量汇款。
    今年２月１日，王长永借北京市某礼堂召开“中国中学生通讯社”成立大会，宣布自己为首任社长、某位名人为名誉社长，新闻界、教育界、文艺界５０余位知名人士为顾问。然而，许多老同志并不知道这回事。（本报２月２日曾误登过成立大会的消息，特向读者致歉。——编者）
    王长永年仅１７岁，在人们眼中还只是个孩子，但他的活动能量令人吃惊。王长永应对自己的所作所为负责，那么社会又该对此负何责任？
    对王长永的问题，公安机关正在审理中。
