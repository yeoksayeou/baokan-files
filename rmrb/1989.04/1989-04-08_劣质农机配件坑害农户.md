Over the past few years, the number of manufacturers producing agricultural machinery parts has increased, but some of these manufacturers do not pay attention to product quality. Some parts become unusable after just a few days. In my town, farmer Xu Luocheng has a tractor that has had eight sets of cylinder liners, fifteen sets of piston rings, three crankshafts, and twelve sets of plungers replaced in just three years. Two of the sets of plungers were unusable as soon as they were purchased. In three years, he has replaced over 300 parts, spending more than 5,400 yuan.

Some agricultural machinery parts are of such poor quality that they affect safe operation. In my town, tractor driver Wu Qilin died in a rollover accident because a newly replaced steering knuckle pin broke. I hope that agricultural machinery parts manufacturers will pay close attention to quality control and produce qualified parts. Relevant departments should also strengthen management and strictly prohibit unqualified products from entering the market.

　　劣质农机配件坑害农户
    近几年来，生产农机配件的厂家越来越多，但有一些厂家不注意产品质量，有的配件用不了几天就报废。我镇农机手徐落成有一台拖拉机，三年内换了八对气缸套，十五副活塞环，三根曲轴，十二对柱塞，其中两对柱塞买回后就不能用。三年内，他共更换配件三百多件，开支五千四百多元。
    有些农机配件质量差，以致于影响到安全行车。我镇拖拉机手吴其林就是因新换转向羊角轴折断而翻车摔死的。希望农机配件生产厂家把好质量关，生产合格的配件。有关部门也要加强管理，严禁不合格的产品流入市场。
