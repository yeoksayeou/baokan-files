State Statistical Bureau spokesman Zhang Zhongji today revealed at a press conference that in the first quarter, China's economic rectification efforts have achieved initial success, and the situation of overheated industry and cold agriculture is beginning to change.

In the production sector, industrial growth has slowed. The first quarter achieved a production value of 292.2 billion yuan, an increase of 10.4% over the same period last year, with a growth rate 6.3 percentage points lower than the same period last year. The elasticity coefficient of energy production growth to industrial production growth has increased from 0.23:1 in the same period last year to 0.38:1.

Agriculture has had a good start. First, the organization and leadership of agriculture have been strengthened, and investments from various sectors have increased. In the first quarter, the state's financial support for agriculture amounted to 2.76 billion yuan, an increase of 30.3% over the same period last year. Local government support for agriculture has also increased to varying degrees. Second, the planting structure is being adjusted in a direction favorable to improving supply. According to a sample survey of farmers' intentions, the total area planted with grain this year is expected to increase by more than 20 million mu compared to last year. Third, summer grain crops are growing well, but some regions face threats from drought and pests. Fourth, pig production remains stable. By the end of March, there were 320 million pigs, an increase of 4.5%. However, due to rising feed prices, there is a possibility of production declines in some areas, which needs attention.

In the construction sector, investment scale has been reduced, and new projects have been significantly decreased. Nationwide, 18,000 investment projects have been decided to be halted or slowed down, which can reduce investment in the coming years by 64.7 billion yuan. In the first quarter, state-owned enterprises completed fixed asset investments totaling 18.4 billion yuan, a decrease of 3.3% compared to the same period last year; 1,327 construction and renovation projects worth more than 500,000 yuan were started, a decrease of 2,879 projects compared to the same period last year.

　　一季度国民经济整治初见成效    
    工业热农业冷开始改变
    本报北京４月２１日讯  记者张国荣报道：国家统计局新闻发言人章钟基今天在新闻发布会上透露，一季度我国国民经济治理整顿工作取得初步成效，工业过热、农业过冷的局面开始改变。
    生产领域中，工业发展速度回落。一季度实现产值２９２２亿元，比去年同期增长１０．４％，增幅比去年同期低６．３个百分点。能源生产增长同工业生产增长的弹性系数，由去年同期的０．２３∶１，提高到０．３８∶１。
    农业发展有了良好开端。一是对农业的组织领导加强，各方面投入增加。一季度国家财政支农支出２７．６亿元，比去年同期增长３０．３％。地方政府支农资金也有不同程度增长。二是种植业结构朝有利于改善供给的方向调整。据农户意向抽样调查预测，全年粮食播种面积将比去年增加２０００多万亩。三是夏粮作物长势较好，但有些地区面临干旱、虫灾威胁。四是生猪生产保持稳定发展。３月底生猪存栏３．２亿头，增长４．５％。但由于饲料涨价，局部地区有可能出现生产滑坡，须引起重视。
    建设领域中，投资规模有所压缩，新开工项目明显减少。全国已决定停缓建投资项目１．８万多个，可压缩今后几年投资６４７亿元。一季度全民所有制单位完成固定资产投资１８４亿元，比去年同期下降３．３％；新开工５万元以上基建和更改项目１３２７个，比去年同期减少２８７９个。
