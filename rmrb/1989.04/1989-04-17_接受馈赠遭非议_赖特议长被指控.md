According to reports from U.S. newspapers, after nearly ten months of investigation, the U.S. House of Representatives Ethics Committee recently voted to accuse House Speaker and Democratic leader Jim Wright of violating House ethics regulations in approximately 30 instances. This accusation may lead to Wright's departure from the House of Representatives.

The investigation, which began last June, revealed that over the years, Wright had been accepting gifts from his friend George Mallon. These gifts included Wright's wife Betty being named as a "consultant" and receiving an annual salary of $18,000, as well as the free use of an apartment and a car. Wright failed to report these gifts as required. Additionally, Wright was accused of earning $55,000 by selling his book of speeches, "Reflections of a Public Man," multiple times to interest groups, House lobbyists, and party supporters. All these activities violated House regulations prohibiting members from accepting gifts worth more than $100 from anyone with an interest in legislation.

　　接受馈赠遭非议
　　赖特议长被指控
    本报讯　据美国报纸报道，经过近十个月的调查，美国众议院道德委员会最近通过表决指控众院议长、民主党领袖吉姆·赖特在约３０件事情上违犯众议院有关的操行规定。这项指控很可能导致赖特离开众议院。
    从去年６月开始的这项调查表明，几年来，赖特一直接受其好友乔治·马立克的馈赠，其中包括赖特夫人贝蒂被挂名为“顾问”而每年收取１８０００美元酬金并免费使用一套公寓和汽车。对此，赖特没有按规定如实申报。赖特还被指控通过向利益集团、议院说客和党派支持者多次销售他的讲演集《一个社会活动家的思考》而获得５５０００美元的收入。所有这些活动都违犯了众院关于禁止议员从任何对立法感兴趣的人手中收取超过１００美元赠品的规定。
