From April 1 this year, the domestic postage for ordinary letters in Japan has increased from 60 yen to 62 yen. This means that letters which previously required only one stamp featuring a clock image now need an additional stamp with a dog image to be sent, otherwise, they will be returned.

The inconvenience does not end there. Starting from this day, any transaction involving a price will incur an additional 3% of the consumption amount. This is Japan's newly implemented consumption tax.

A public opinion poll conducted by Kyodo News today shows that among those surveyed, 65% advocate for the abolition of the new tax system, 30% support modifications, and only 5% are in favor.

The consumption tax is a measure introduced by the Japanese government and the Liberal Democratic Party to increase national revenue. At the same time, the government has appropriately reduced income tax and corporate tax, and abolished the commodity tax on some high-end products.

### 日本征收消费税

　　日本征收消费税
    自今年４月１日起，日本普通信件国内邮费由６０日元改为６２日元。这就要求人们在迄今贴上１张印有大钟图案的邮票即可寄到的信上，还必须再贴１张印有狗的邮票，否则将被退回。
    麻烦远不止于此。从这天起，凡是有价消费行为，都要多花相当于消费额３％的钱。这就是日本新实施的消费税。
    日本共同社今天发表的一项舆论调查表明，在被调查的人中，６５％的人主张废除、３０％的人主张修改这一新税制，拥护者只占５％。
    消费税是日本政府和自民党为了增加国库收入而增设的。与此同时，政府适当降低了所得税、法人税，废除了一些高级商品的物品税。
