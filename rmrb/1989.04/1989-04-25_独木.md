		A Single Tree
		Chén Lì

		After crossing the Kunlun Mountains, the grassland stretches endlessly. Purple, white, yellow, and blue flowers dot the landscape, and sheep roll down from the snow-capped peaks of the Qilian Mountains like snowballs. Black yak hair tents have white smoke rising from their tops. In the distance, a vast mirror hangs over the green carpet, shimmering with blue light. The closer it gets, the larger and more magnificent it becomes, boundless.

		Qinghai Lake!

		Driving around the lake for a full circle, it is exactly 350 kilometers. There are sandy beaches, shallow grass, and rapeseed flowers, but not a single green tree or shrub. On the northwest side of the lake, a small island rises from the lakebed like a stalagmite, inhabited by hundreds of cormorants. The shore, covered in sand and stones, is where young spotted-billed ducks waddle, and above, white gulls and brown larks soar. Perhaps the parents of these gulls and spotted-billed ducks can still recall the dense tropical rainforests near the Bay of Bengal, and the fresh, moist air they felt flying above the forests. However, the native larks have never stood on a branch to sing a love song.

		As I turned to leave with a sense of inexplicable regret, a cold wind from the Qilian Mountains brought a rustling sound. Where could there be trees in this high-altitude plateau above 3,000 meters and the snow line? Looking around, there was nothing but shallow grass, sandy beaches, and lake water. Suddenly, my gaze was drawn to a thick patch of green. I ran over. By the lake, in a depression, stood a tall small-leaf poplar. As far as the eye could see, it was the only tree on the vast grassland!

		I was overjoyed and asked the accompanying Old Han. He had worked at Qinghai Lake for 17 years, and even he said it was a miracle. More than 20 years ago, a group of young people transferred from the North Sea Fleet built brick houses here for the first time, raised fish, and conducted scientific experiments. Nostalgia for their hometowns on the plains gave them the idea to plant trees and flowers. They brought poplar saplings from the Kunlun Mountains, planting them around the camp and by Qinghai Lake. But the lake water is salty, and contains magnesium, which is not conducive to plant growth. One sapling after another could not endure the cold winds from the Qilian Mountains, the severe cold of winter with temperatures dropping to minus several dozen degrees, or the biting salt and alkali. They planted and they died, died and they planted again. No one could remember exactly how many years had passed. But eventually, one small-leaf poplar tree broke and grew new branches, shed its leaves and sprouted new ones, miraculously surviving.

		This small-leaf poplar stands alone here, isn't it lonely? Old Han, this red-faced Shandong man, couldn't help but sigh. He pointed to the sandy beach by the lake and told me a shocking figure: the lake water level drops an average of 18 centimeters per year, and in 17 years, it has dropped more than 2 meters. The sandy beach is expanding at the same rate. The vast grassland is slowly turning into a desert.

		The lake water, surrounded by the desert, is still as blue as ever, still shimmering. But the deep-water scientific experiments of the past can no longer be conducted, and those young people had to leave. No one brought tree saplings anymore, and no one came to try planting trees. They left, taking with them their dreams and love.

		A cold wind blew, and the small-leaf poplar rustled again. Pairs of larks would perch on the branches one moment and fly into the sky the next, singing with her. She couldn't hear our sighs, but she happily swayed her glossy green leaves, casting her beautiful crown and long shadow onto the barren sand.

　　独木

    翻过日月山，草原望不到边。紫的、白的、黄的、蓝的小花点缀其间，绵羊像雪球似地从祁连山雪峰下滚来。黑色的牦牛帐篷顶上冒出乳白色炊烟。远远地一面巨大的明镜悬浮在绿草毯上，闪着湖蓝色的光。愈来愈近，愈来愈大，壮阔无边。
    青海湖！
    驱车绕湖一周，整整３５０公里。沙滩，浅草，油菜花，没有一棵绿树一丛灌木。湖的西北面，一座如石笋般从湖底冒出的小岛上栖息着成百上千只鸬鹚，遍布砂石的湖边蹒跚着还不会飞的小斑头雁，空中遨翔着洁白的鸥鸟和褐色的百灵。那些鸥鸟、斑头雁的爸爸妈妈们或许还能回想起遥远的孟加拉湾附近密密的热带雨林，回想起飞越森林上空时感受到的湿润清新的气息，而土生土长的百灵则世世代代都没能站在枝头唱一曲情歌。
    正当我怀着莫名的惋惜转身离去时，从祁连山上刮来的冷风带来了一阵沙沙声，在这海拔３０００多米、雪线以上的高原，哪儿来的树木？环顾四周，一览无余，浅草，沙滩，湖水，再环顾……视线忽然为一团浓绿所吸引。我跑过去。湖水旁，洼地里，赫然立着一株挺拔的小叶杨。目力所及的大草原上，独此一株！
    万分惊喜地问陪同的老韩，他在青海湖工作了１７年，连他也说这是一个奇迹。２０多年以前有一批从北海舰队转业来的年轻人，在这儿第一次盖上了砖瓦房，养鱼，进行科学试验。对平原故乡的怀恋，使他们萌发了种树栽花的奇想。从日月山那边运来了杨树苗，种在营地四周，种在青海湖边。可湖水是咸的，而水里又含镁，不利于植物生长。一棵又一棵杨树苗，忍受不了从祁连山刮来的寒风，忍受不了隆冬零下几十度的严寒，忍受不了蜇人的盐碱。栽了死，死了再栽，到底过了多少年谁也记不准了。反正，就这么一棵小叶杨树干断了，又长出新枝，叶儿落了，又迸出新叶，奇迹般地活下来了。
    这棵小叶杨就这样形单影只地立在这儿，不孤寂么？老韩这位红脸山东大汉竟不住叹息起来。他指着湖边的沙滩，告诉我一个惊人的数字：湖水每年平均下降１８厘米，１７年来已下降２米多，沙滩也以这样的速度扩大。苍茫的大草原，慢慢地向沙漠退化。
    沙漠包围的湖水依然碧如蓝，依然波光粼粼，可昔日的深水科学试验已无法进行，那些年轻人也不得不离去。再也没有人去运树苗，再也没有人来这作栽种树木的尝试。他们走了，留下了梦想，留下了遗爱。
    一阵寒风吹来，小叶杨又沙沙地哦吟起来，一对对百灵忽儿掠上枝头忽儿飞上云天，与她和唱。她听不到我们的叹息，一迳欢乐地摇着油亮的绿叶，将华美的树冠修长的身影投射到寸草不生的沙地上。
