The Administrative Litigation Law has been approved by the National People's Congress. Should people change the old notion that "citizens cannot sue officials"?

Endu Mu Zheng: In the minds of the common people, there indeed exists the traditional idea that "citizens dare not sue officials," because they do not know that in law, their status is equal to that of officials. Changing this notion is not easy. We always say that Communist Party cadres are servants of the people, and that the people are the masters. However, when a servant breaks the law and infringes upon the rights of the master, the master dares not sue the servant. When the servant hears that the master is suing him, he becomes furious.

Reporter: I hear that some administrative departments have concerns. Does the Administrative Litigation Law encourage citizens to sue officials?

Endu Mu Zheng: We want to encourage citizens to sue. In other words, we want to learn to use administrative litigation to protect legal rights.

Reporter: How do you think administrative officials should improve their ability to handle administrative law?

Endu Mu Zheng: In the future, the recruitment and evaluation of administrative officials should include legal knowledge. For example, if you are the director of an education bureau or a school principal, your desk should have a full set of regulations related to your position. Some administrative officials do not understand the law or study it. When they encounter problems, they only know how to report and seek instructions. Whatever the higher authorities say, they do it. If the higher authorities break the law, they follow suit. They only use the leader's speeches and red-headed documents as the basis for their actions, rather than the law.

Reporter: Some people think that the scope of cases accepted by the Administrative Litigation Law is narrow. What is your view? Additionally, what do you think about the law coming into effect a year later?

Endu Mu Zheng: This is a newly established law. If the scope is too broad, there is a question of capacity. Moreover, it is difficult to demand that a new law be very complete. The courts need to accumulate experience, train judges, and citizens also need to be mentally prepared. All of this takes time. Therefore, it makes sense to implement it a year later.

Reporter: What more should we do in legal education?

Endu Mu Zheng: Currently, administrative law is a weak link in legal education. In the future, it should be given more attention. Lawyers, like doctors, cannot treat all diseases. Someone who is good at real estate litigation may not be good at handling divorce cases. A lawyer who is good at handling divorce cases may not be good at administrative litigation cases. Lawyers should gradually become specialized. Each law firm should have someone specializing in administrative litigation, cultivating experts and talents in this area.

　　行诉法带来新课题
    本报记者  孟晓云
    七届人大二次会议结束前夕，记者访问了人大代表端木正。端木正：六十九岁，中山大学法律系教授兼法学研究所所长、中国国际法学会常务理事、香港基本法起草委员会委员、广东岭南律师事务所名誉所长。
    记者（以下简称记）：行政诉讼法已经人大审议通过。人们是否应改变一个旧的观念——民不能告官？
    端木正（以下简称端木）：在老百姓中间确实存在“民不敢告官”的传统思想，因为他们不知道现在自己和官的地位在法律上是平等的。要改变这个观念很不容易，我们整天说共产党的干部是人民的公仆，人民当家作主，可是仆人违法侵犯主人权益，主人不敢告仆人，仆人听到主人告他会火冒三丈。
    记：听说一些行政部门有顾虑，行政诉讼法是不是鼓动老百姓告官啊？
    端木：我们就是要鼓动老百姓打官司，也就是说，要学会运用行政诉讼保障合法权益。
    记：您认为行政官员应怎样提高对行政法的承受能力？
    端木：今后行政官员的招聘和考核应包括法律知识一项。比如，你当教育局长或中学校长，在你的办公桌上就应该有全套的与你职务有关的法规。有些行政官员不懂法也不研究法，遇事只知请示报告，上级怎么批他就怎么办，上级违法他也跟着违法，他们只以首长讲话和红头文件为依据，而不以法律为依据行使自己的职权。
    记：有人认为行政诉讼法的受案范围较窄，您怎么看？另外，您对此法一年后才付诸实施怎么看？
    端木：这是一个新立的法，范围太广，有一个承受能力的问题，再说，要求一个新法非常完备也很难。法院需要积累经验，培训法官，官民也要有思想上的准备，这一切都有个过程。所以，一年后才实施自有它的道理。
    记：在法学教育方面我们还应做哪些工作？
    端木：目前的法学教育中，行政法还是一个薄弱环节，今后应引起重视。律师和医生一样，谁也不能医治百病，会打房产官司的不一定会处理离婚案，离婚案处理得好的律师不一定能办好行政诉讼案，律师应该逐渐专业化，每个律师机构应有专人研究办理行政诉讼，要培养这方面的专家和能人。
