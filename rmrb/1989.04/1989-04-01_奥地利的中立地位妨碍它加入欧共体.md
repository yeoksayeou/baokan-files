Since Austrian Chancellor announced in mid-March that his country is prepared to join the European Economic Community, this landlocked nation, which has been implementing a permanent neutrality policy for 34 years, has become the focus of Western European public opinion. If the Austrian government's decision is approved by the parliament in April or May, it can formally apply to join the EEC in July.

However, according to informed sources, the 12-nation EEC does not plan to accept new member states before the establishment of a unified market in 1992. Meanwhile, Britain and France believe that if Austria becomes a member of the EEC, its permanent neutrality will hinder the international organization from developing a unified defense plan and foreign policy. If Austria is required to abandon its permanent neutrality policy, it will face opposition from the Soviet Union, as the Soviet Union made Austria's declaration of permanent neutrality a condition for its withdrawal in 1955. Neutral Austria has long been considered by the Soviet Union as part of a barrier against Western Europe. Therefore, Austria's neutrality and the obligation of EEC members to take coordinated actions are incompatible.

### 奥地利的中立地位妨碍它加入欧共体

　　奥地利的中立地位妨碍它加入欧共体
    本报讯  自从奥地利总理３月中旬宣布他的国家准备加入欧洲经济共同体以后，这个执行永久中立政策已３４年的内陆小国便成为西欧舆论所关心的重点。奥地利政府的决定如在４月或５月被国会批准，７月就可正式向欧共体提出申请。
    但是据消息灵通人士说，１２国欧共体在１９９２年建立统一大市场以前不打算接纳新会员国。同时英国和法国认为，奥地利如果成为欧共体的一员，它的永久中立地位将会妨碍这个国际组织产生统一的防务计划和外交政策。如果要求奥地利放弃其永久中立政策，必将受到苏联的反对，因为１９５５年苏联是以奥地利宣布永久中立作为撤军条件的。中立的奥地利一直被苏联当作对西欧屏障的一部分。所以奥地利的中立地位和欧共体成员采取协调行动的义务是不相容的。
