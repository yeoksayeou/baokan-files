The Six Major Disasters of China's Famous Historical Sites

The first major disaster: War
At the end of the Qin Dynasty, Xiang Yu led his troops to attack Xianyang, burning the Alang Palace, which covered 300 li, to the ground. The famous Shaolin Temple on Songshan was burned by the peasant rebels during the Sui Dynasty and by the warlord Shi Yu-san in modern times. Many halls, Buddha statues, scriptures, books, and ritual items were reduced to ashes. Other sites such as the "Tengwang Pavilion" in Jiangxi, the Yuelu Academy in Hunan, the Juyongguan Pass in Beijing, the Xishan Temple, the Zhongyue Temple on Songshan, and the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang were all trampled by wars and disasters.

The second major disaster: Fire
Fire often occurs in conjunction with wars and can also wreak havoc on its own. For example, the Guangji Temple in the Xicheng District of Beijing, near Fuchengmen, has experienced three fires. In January 1934, the main hall and the rear hall were mostly burned down, and the remaining historical scriptures and the white sandalwood statue of Sakyamuni, which were gifts from abroad, were also destroyed in the fire. The Yellow Crane Tower, one of the "Three Famous Towers of Jiangnan," has been destroyed and rebuilt many times.

The third major disaster: Earthquakes
China is a country prone to earthquakes, and many famous historical sites have been destroyed by them. For example, the White Pagoda in Beijing's Beihai Park collapsed due to earthquakes in the 18th year of Kangxi (1679 AD) and the 9th year of Yongzheng (1731 AD), and was rebuilt twice. The Puxian Temple in Yongji County, Shanxi, and the Tianning Temple Wooden Pagoda in Zhengding County, Hebei, were both damaged by earthquakes.

The fourth major disaster: Floods
For example, the famous Lugou Bridge, built during the 29th year of the Jin Dynasty's Dading period (1189 AD), was rebuilt during the 9th year of the Ming Dynasty's Zhengtong period (1444 AD), and was destroyed by floods during the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty. The current bridge was rebuilt in the 37th year of Kangxi (1698 AD). The Liangma Temple in Yangxian County, Shaanxi, built during the 2nd year of the Yuan Dynasty's Zhongtong period (1261 AD), had its original buildings destroyed by floods from the nearby Shui River, leaving only the Mahavira Hall and a newly built theater. The Maling Bridge in Weiyuan County, Gansu, and the Taiping Bridge in She County, Anhui, were also destroyed by floods.

The fifth major disaster: Foreign invasions and imperialist plunder
At the end of the Northern Song Dynasty, due to the invasion of the Jin troops, the Song Dynasty capital Bianliang fell, and all the palaces, gardens, and famous historical sites were leveled to the ground. During the Jiaqing period of the Ming Dynasty (1522–1566 AD), the Leifeng Pagoda in Hangzhou was burned by Japanese pirates, resulting in the entire outer structure being burned away, leaving only the bare tower. Particularly severe was the late Qing Dynasty, when imperialist powers from Britain, France, the United States, Japan, and Russia invaded and plundered, causing irreparable damage to China's thousands of years of cultural relics and historical sites.

The sixth major disaster: Political movements
Historically, the destruction of famous historical sites due to political reasons has also been very serious. For example, the third Buddhist persecution in Chinese history, which occurred in the 3rd year of Huichang during the Tang Dynasty (843 AD), destroyed many halls and Buddha statues at Shaolin Temple. The current Tang Dynasty stone carving of the Maitreya Buddha in the West Pagoda of the Pagoda Courtyard, with its broken shins and limbs, is evidence of the Huichang persecution of Buddhism. The "Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" was an even more destructive looting of China's cultural relics and famous historical sites.

### 中华名胜古迹的六大劫难

　　中华名胜古迹的六大劫难
    第一大劫难：战争秦末项羽率兵攻入咸阳，将覆压３００里的阿房宫付之一炬；著名的嵩山少林寺曾被隋末农民起义军、现代军阀石友三等，纵火焚烧，众多的殿堂、佛像、经卷、书版、法器等等，被化为灰烬；其他如江西“滕王阁”，湖南岳麓书院，北京玉泉山、香山寺，嵩山中岳庙，敦煌莫高窟等等均被战乱兵灾践踏。
    第二大劫难：火灾　它往往与战乱密切结合，又常常单独横行。如北京西城区阜成门内广济寺，曾历经三次火灾。１９３４年１月，庙内正殿及后殿烧毁大半，所存历代经典及国外进贡的白檀木释迦牟尼立像也都葬身火海；我国江南“三大名楼”之一的黄鹤楼，屡毁屡建。
    第三大劫难：地震　我国是多地震的国家，毁于地震的名胜古迹更是史不绝书。如北京北海的白塔，康熙１８年（公元１６７９年）、雍正９年（公元１７３１年）均因地震塌毁，先后两次重修；山西永济县普救寺、河北正定县天宁寺木塔，都遭到地震的破坏。
    第四大劫难：洪水　如闻名中外的卢沟桥，始建于金大定２９年（公元１１８９年），明正统９年（公元１４４４年）重修，清康熙年间遭洪水冲毁。现存之桥是康熙３７年（公元１６９８年）重建的；陕西洋县城西的良马寺建于元中统二年（公元１２６１年）。寺内原有的建筑群经附近湑水多次泛滥冲毁，现仅存大雄宝殿及增修的戏楼一座；甘肃省渭源县的灞陵桥，安徽歙县的太平桥均毁于洪水。
    第五大劫难：外族入侵和帝国主义掠夺　北宋末年，由于金兵大举入侵，宋朝都城汴京沦陷，所有宫殿园林、名胜古迹全部夷为平地；杭州雷峰塔在明代嘉靖时（公元１５２２—１５６６年）倭寇入侵，纵火焚烧，结果塔的外廓全部烧掉，变成了一座只剩塔身的裸塔；特别惨重的是清朝末年，英、法、美、日、俄等帝国主义大举入侵掠夺，使中国几千年文物古迹遭受了永远无法弥补的损失。
    第六大劫难：政治运动　历史上因政治原因对名胜古迹的毁坏也十分严重。如发生在唐武宗会昌３年（公元８４３年）的我国历史上的第三次灭佛事件，使少林寺许多殿宇、佛像被毁，现在塔院西塔内唐代石雕弥勒像的胫、肢断裂，即是会昌灭佛留下的实证；“十年浩劫”对我国的文物名胜古迹更是一场破坏性的大洗劫。
