Friendship Across the Seto
— A Record of Premier Li Peng's Visit to the Seto Bridge

The People's Daily reporter Yu Qing

Premier Li Peng and his wife, along with their entourage, departed Tokyo in the morning of April 15th. Their first activity was to visit the Seto Bridge, which had just celebrated its first birthday.

The Seto Bridge spans the Seto Inland Sea between Honshu and Shikoku, with a total length of 13.1 kilometers and a main bridge length of 9.4 kilometers. This bridge, constructed with Japan's most advanced contemporary technology, is currently the world's longest combined road and railway bridge.

Li Peng and his entourage drove from the Honshu side in Okayama Prefecture onto the bridge. After about 15 minutes, they entered the Shikoku side in Kagawa Prefecture. Simply crossing the bridge does not allow one to fully appreciate its grandeur. Fortunately, the hosts arranged for Li Peng and his entourage to board the "Hiyoko" No. 3 yacht, which sailed out to sea, providing a panoramic view of the bridge.

The Seto Bridge is built at the narrowest point of the Seto Inland Sea, with piers constructed on six small islands that the bridge passes through, showcasing the designers' ingenuity in utilizing natural features. The bridge's design is unconventional, featuring six main suspension bridges and cable-stayed bridges interconnected by tracks, forming a seamless and magnificent structure.

According to the bridge construction organizers, a proposal to build the bridge was made over a century ago. In 1955, a ferry accident in the Seto Inland Sea resulted in over 160 deaths, prompting the decision to build the bridge. After approximately 20 years of feasibility studies and geological surveys, construction began in 1978. Following nearly a decade of effort, the Seto Bridge was completed and opened to traffic on April 10th of the previous year, fulfilling the long-held wish of the people on both sides.

Li Peng inquired about the funding for the bridge construction and the current traffic volume. The organizers replied that the total construction cost was over 113.3 billion yen, with the state contributing 10% and loans accounting for 90%. Of the loans, 30% came from the government and 70% from private banks. The loan interest rate ranged from 4.8% to 5%, with plans to recover the investment through tolls over 33 years. Currently, the bridge sees an average of 11,000 vehicles per day, with a one-way toll for cars of around 6,500 yen.

Li Peng asked, "Is the toll too high?" The Japanese officials present laughed heartily. The host explained that Li Peng had raised a sharp question. Indeed, there are people who oppose the high tolls. However, due to the high interest rates on the loans, the current tolls are necessary to repay the investment as quickly as possible.

The host then answered some technical and other questions. The bridge consumed 1 million tons of steel, equivalent to 1% of Japan's annual steel production. The bridge is designed to withstand earthquakes of magnitude 8 or higher and can withstand wind speeds of nearly 50 meters per second. The length of the steel cables used is enough to circle the Earth more than three times, with the main steel cables consisting of over 270 thin cables, each with a diameter of 1.5 meters. The distance from the water surface to the bridge deck is 65 meters, allowing the passage of the world's largest ships. The construction of the bridge has promoted economic development on both sides, with a steady stream of tourists and a significant increase in new factories.

Premier Li Peng remarked that the construction of the Seto Bridge is a remarkable feat of first-class technology, comparable to the Seikan Tunnel connecting Honshu and Hokkaido.

In addition to the Seto Bridge itself being impressive, the contributions made by the people on both sides in promoting Sino-Japanese friendship are also inspiring. On the western shore in Kagawa Prefecture, Li Peng and his entourage visited the China Exhibition Hall in the Seto Bridge Memorial Hall. The famous Japanese politician Masayoshi Ohira was born in Kagawa Prefecture, and the hall displays a seal and a replica of the "Autobiography of Huaisu" given to him by Chairman Mao Zedong. The renowned female table tennis player Junko Matsuzaki also hails from Kagawa Prefecture, and a photo of Premier Zhou Enlai warmly conversing with her captivates many visitors. There are also numerous photos of economic, cultural, and sports exchanges between Kagawa Prefecture and China. On the eastern shore in Okayama Prefecture, during the Tang Dynasty, Kibi no Makibi made two sea voyages to study in Tang China; Guo Moruo, in his early years, studied in Okayama, which has been passed down as a cherished story. Kibei Kataoka, who has deep affection for Premier Zhou, also comes from Okayama Prefecture. Mr. Kataoka accompanied Li Peng and his entourage from Tokyo to Okayama. Li Peng learned that the next day (April 16th) was Mr. Kataoka's 92nd birthday and, with great emotion, wrote, "Congratulations on Mr. Kataoka's 92nd Birthday, May he live as long as the southern mountains," and presented it to Mr. Kataoka, praising his unwavering dedication to the cause of Sino-Japanese friendship over the years.

The Seto Bridge connects Kagawa and Okayama Prefectures. The people of Kagawa and Okayama have also built a bridge of friendship in the hearts of the people of the two countries.

　　濑户传友情
　　——记李鹏总理参观濑户大桥
    本报记者　于青
    李鹏总理和夫人一行，１５日早晨告别东京后，第一个活动项目是，参观刚过一周岁生日的濑户大桥。
    濑户大桥凌驾于本州和四国之间的濑户内海之上，大桥全长１３．１公里。主桥全长９．４公里。这是集中当代日本先进技术建成的、是目前世界上最长的公路铁路两用桥。
    李鹏一行乘车从本州一端的冈山县驶入桥面，约１５分钟后，进入大桥另一端的四国香川县境内。只在桥上走过，难免有“不识庐山真面目”之感。承蒙主人精心安排，李鹏一行登上一艘“飞翔”３号游艇，驶至海面，远眺大桥，一览无余。
    濑户大桥建在濑户内海的最狭处，桥墩修建在大桥穿越的６个小岛上，显示了设计者巧借天然的智慧。桥身造型不拘一格，分为６座正吊桥和斜吊桥，其间有轨道相通，浑然一体，蔚为壮观。
    据大桥施工组织者介绍，百年之前，就有人提出架桥建议。１９５５年，濑户内海发生一起死亡１６０余人的渡轮翻沉事件，促发了架桥的决心。经过约２０年的可行性研究和地质调查后，于１９７８年架桥开工，又经近１０年的努力，去年４月１０日，濑户大桥竣工通车，实现了两岸人民多年的夙愿。
    李鹏询问建桥资金来源和建成后的交通量。组织者回答说，建桥总投资１１３３０多亿日元，其中国家出资占１０％，贷款为９０％。贷款中国家占３０％，民间银行占７０％。贷款利率４．８％—５％，计划通过收取过桥费３３年收回投资。现在大桥日平均通过１１０００辆车，轿车过桥费单程６５００日元左右。
    李鹏问：“过桥费是不是收得太高？”在座的日本人士听后哈哈大笑。主人说，李鹏总理提出了一个尖锐的问题。现在的确有人反对收费太高。但由于贷款利率较高，为尽快偿还投资贷款目前只能如此。
    然后，主人又回答了一些技术性和其他问题。建桥耗用钢铁量为１００万吨，相当于日本年钢产量的百分之一。大桥耐８级以上地震，能承受秒速近５０米的风力。所用钢缆长度能绕地球３周多，主钢缆由２７０多根细钢缆组成，直径１．５米。水面到桥身的距离６５米，能通过目前世界上最大的轮船。大桥建成后，促进了两岸经济发展，游客整年不断，新建工厂剧增。
    李鹏总理说，建设濑户大桥是了不起的一流技术，可以与连结本州和北海道的青函隧道相媲美。
    除了濑户大桥本身令人赞叹，大桥两岸人民在中日友好交流中作出的贡献也令人感奋。在西岸香川县，李鹏一行参观了大桥纪念馆的中国展厅。日本著名政治家大平正芳就出身香川县，展厅中陈列着毛泽东主席送给他的砚台和《怀素自叙帖真迹》的影印本。著名女乒乓球运动员松崎君代也出身香川县，一幅周总理和她亲切交谈的照片，使不少人驻足凝望。还有许多香川县与中国进行经济、文化、体育交流的照片。在大桥东岸的冈山县，唐朝时期，当地的吉备真备两次渡海赴唐求学；中国的郭沫若早年留学冈山等，一直传为佳话。对周总理一往情深的冈崎嘉平太也出身冈山县。冈崎先生陪同李鹏一行从东京到冈山，李鹏得知明天（４月１６日）是冈崎先生诞辰日，欣然挥毫写下：“祝冈崎先生九十二寿辰　寿比南山”的祝词，赠与冈崎先生，并动情地说，杰出人物应该长寿。赞扬他矢志不移，多年为中日友好事业奔走。
    濑户大桥把香川和冈山两县连在一起。香川和冈山人民也把中日友谊之桥建在两国人民心中。
