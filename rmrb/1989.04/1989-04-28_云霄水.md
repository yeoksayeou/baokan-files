	Cloudy Water
	Li Guowen

	While Beijing is still in the early spring with willow catkins flying, we arrived in Minnan and set foot on the ancient yet youthful land of Yunxiao County. The season here is perfect for enjoying ripe guavas, blooming lychee flowers, lush citrus, and curling banana leaves.

	Oh, what a green Yunxiao, a Yunxiao full of vitality!

	Driving south, the wheat sprouts in the North China Plain have just turned green, but upon arriving in Yunxiao, the mountains, rivers, sea, and fields are all a jade-green, bright and dense. Nature has adorned Yunxiao with vibrant colors.

	It happened to be the Qingming Festival, and the drizzling rain, the wispy sea breeze, the paper money fluttering on the paths, and the incense smoke wafting around the temples all allowed us to experience the lingering ancient customs and pure local sentiments. Although General Mountain is shrouded in mist, appearing and disappearing, and the Zhangjiang River quietly rises and falls with the tides, everything seems eternally calm and natural, Yunxiao, located in the Golden Triangle of Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, and Xiamen, is also spreading its wings with a soaring attitude. Walking into any village or factory, one can feel the pulsating rhythm of the times. Similarly, no matter who you talk to, it seems everyone has a sense of urgency to make up for lost time. Yunxiao is not very rich, but it has the capital and determination to become wealthy. Therefore, coming to Yunxiao at this time, observing their progress amidst the interplay of change and constancy, might be more meaningful.

	Yunxiao is an ancient county, with a long history. It is said that during the Tang Dynasty's Zhenyuan era, it was established as a county. General Chen Zheng from Henan personally led thousands of soldiers to open up the coastal areas, cultivate the land, and settle down. Today, most people in Yunxiao can trace their roots back to the central plains of Henan.

	Arriving in Yunxiao, not far from the Tropic of Cancer, this place is surrounded by mountains and seas, with a mild climate, fertile soil, and abundant water, making it an ideal place for forests and fruits. What leaves the deepest impression is Yunxiao's water. The water from the ocean, rivers, and underground rock layers seems to be an important factor in Yunxiao's economic vitality. Not only is water needed for brewing tea, but also for forestry, fruit farming, fishing, and aquaculture, all of which are closely related to water and cannot be separated from it for a moment.

	The beauty of Yunxiao lies in its water, and its wealth will also come from its water.

	Fengtou Reservoir is the largest water body in Yunxiao County, covering 15,000 mu (approximately 1,000 hectares) and storing nearly 200 million cubic meters of water. The water flows through an 80-kilometer-long canal, as impressive as the Great Wall, supplying water to Dongshan Island across the sea and adding vitality to the frontline island.

	Yunxiao's aquatic products are famous far and wide, with sea-farmed products exported overseas. However, what interests us is a medium-sized village-run eel farm. This example seems to illustrate the immense potential of liberated productive forces. The small village of Xikou in Xiaotian Township still retains the ancient "Weiwu" (fortified village), but this absolutely closed-off village can no longer confine the young farmers. They break out of the "Weiwu" and operate a modern eel farm. Competition makes these farmers, who have ventured into commodity economics, grow. This eel farm earns 200,000 US dollars in foreign exchange annually.

	Therefore, the mountains are still the same as yesterday, and the water is still the same as yesterday, but visiting Xiaxiang Village, one can truly feel how deeply reform and opening up have changed the landscape of mountains and rivers. The villagers say that in the past, they had golden land under their feet but empty rice jars and coin purses. Now, the mountains are full of trees, the fields are full of vegetables, the hills are full of fruits, and new buildings fill the villages. Walking through the village, one is truly amazed. The houses are built so large and well, making Beijing visitors exclaim in surprise. Xiaxiang Village is known for its fruits, especially guavas. Near the highway and close to the county seat, there are not many villages that have become rich first, but in any case, this signifies hope. Fruits are also Yunxiao's strong suit. The guavas, lychees, mushrooms, and asparagus canned foods we usually eat are mostly produced by the Changshan Overseas Chinese Farm Canning Factory and Yunxiao Canning Factory in the area. Following the host up to the green mountains, the layered forests, fragrant flowers, bubbling springs, and flying butterflies, it is the busy season for picking the earliest ripe guavas of the year. The host is hospitable, offering fresh guavas, sweet and refreshing, leaving a lingering fragrance in the mouth. Even after many days, it still makes one reminisce.

	If we talk about the best water in Yunxiao, it would naturally be the mineral water from under General Mountain. In the face of increasingly polluted human ecological environments, this high-quality mineral water from 150 meters deep in the granite rock can truly be called the nectar of nature. The water is clear and pure, and according to the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, it is a high-quality natural mineral water rich in strontium and metasilicic acid, containing various trace elements and components beneficial to human health. We visited the General Mountain Mineral Water Factory and saw the endless and inexhaustible sweet spring water being continuously extracted, bottled, sealed, and packed for shipment.

	Minnan has many springs, and Yunxiao even has the rare sea hot springs, but under General Mountain, this well with abundant reserves and top-grade mineral water was not easy to find. After much effort in site selection and multiple drillings, the best was chosen to achieve perfection. This also reflects the Yunxiao pioneers' relentless pursuit. Although the start was difficult, for the cause of Yunxiao's reform, they sing the praises of mountains and seas, focus on the production of two waters (aquatic products and fruits), and at the same time, invest in the development of mineral water resources. Who knows, one day, Yunxiao's fruits, aquatic products, and even General Mountain mineral water may not only be sold nationwide but also worldwide!

	May Yunxiao rise to the clouds, with a bright future!

### 云霄水

　　云霄水
    李国文
    京城尚是杨花璎珞，柳絮飞舞的初春，我们来到闽南，踏上云霄县这块古老却焕发出青春的土地，已是枇杷黄熟，荔枝花繁，柑桔蕤葳，蕉叶舒卷的佳季。
    哦，好一个绿染的云霄，洋溢着生机的云霄。
    乘车南下，华北平原的麦苗刚刚泛青，到得云霄，那山，那水，那海，那田，竟一片翡翠般绿，绿得晶莹，绿得浓重，大自然把云霄装点得花团锦簇。
    恰逢清明，那淅淅沥沥的细雨，丝丝缕缕的海风，飘拂在阡陌上的纸钱，缭绕在庙宇间的香火，仍可体验到这块土地上的依稀古风，纯朴民情。虽然，将军山在雾氲中若隐若现，漳江水静静地随海潮涨落，一切显得亘古不变的安详自然，但位处于泉州、漳州、厦门金三角地区的云霄古城，也正以飞凌云霄的姿态展翅了。随便踏进一处村落，一间工厂，都能切身感受到时代跃动的脉搏。同样，无论同谁交谈，好像都有失去好多年的遗憾而必须急起直追的迫切感。云霄并不很富，但却具有富起来的本钱和决心，所以在这时来到云霄，在变与不变的互动中看他们的进展或许更有意义些。
    云霄是座古县城，有悠久的历史。相传在唐代垂拱年间就建县制了。河南陈征将军亲率数千子弟兵来此开辟海疆，然后屯田守土，休养生息。如今的云霄人，绝大多数可以寻根到中原豫土。
    来到距北回归线不远的云霄，这里依山傍海，气候温和，土肥水美，宜林宜果，是得天独厚的一方宝地。给人留下最深刻印象的，莫过于云霄水了。海洋的水，江河的水，地下岩层里的水，似乎是构成云霄经济活跃的一个重要因素。不仅仅泡功夫茶需要水，林果农渔，养殖捕捞，都和水攸切相关，须臾离不了的。
    云霄的美，美在水上，云霄的富，也将富在水上。
    峰头水库是云霄县最大的水面，一万五千亩宽阔，蓄水近两亿立方米。水流沿着８０公里的气势不让长城的高架灌溉渠道，输送到隔海的东山岛，为前沿岛屿增添生命的活力。
    云霄的水产遐迩闻名，海水养殖的产品远销海外。但令我们感兴趣的是一家规模中等的村办养鳗场，这例证似乎在说明解放了的生产力，可以发挥出多大能量。小小的火田乡溪口村至今还留着古老的“围屋”，这种绝对封闭状态的村落再也锁不住年青农民的手脚，他们冲出“围屋”，经营起现代化的养鳗场。竞争使这些涉足商品经济的农民成长，这养鳗场年创汇高达２０万美元。
    因此，山还是昨天的山，水还是昨天的水，可到下坂村作客，才体会到改革开放是怎样深刻地改变着山山水水的面貌。乡民们说，过去是脚踏黄金宝地，米瓮钱袋两空，如今是林满山，菜满田，水果满山岗，新楼满村庄。到村里走一遭，确实吓一跳，房屋修建得之大之好，令北京来客咋舌惊叹。下坂村出水果，枇杷最负盛名，邻近公路，紧靠县城，这样先富起来的村庄还不很多，但无论如何这意味着一种希望。水果也是云霄的强项，我们通常食用的枇杷、荔枝、蘑菇、芦笋罐头，不少是产自当地的常山华侨农场罐头厂和云霄罐头厂。随着主人登上触目尽绿的山岗，层林叠翠，花香洋溢，山泉叮咚，鸟飞蝶舞，正是采撷一年中熟得最早的枇杷的大忙季节。主人殷勤，劝尝新鲜，甜美甘洌，留香齿颊。时隔多日，犹令人回味。
    要说云霄水中的最佳品，自然数将军山下的矿泉水了。在人类生态环境逐渐被污染的情况下，这来自１５０米地下花岗岩石中的优质矿泉水，真可以称为大自然的琼浆玉液。水色澄澈、水质清洌，据地矿部鉴定，为含锶和偏硅酸的重碳酸—钙·钠型优质饮用天然矿泉水，水中含有多种有益人体健康的微量元素和成分。我们走访了将军山矿泉水厂，看到取之不尽、用之不竭的甘泉美水，源源不断地抽取出来，灌瓶、封盖、装箱，准备外运。
    闽南多泉，云霄甚至还有少见的海水温泉，但在将军山下，打出储量丰富、属矿泉水佼佼上品的这口井，颇费周折，多方觅址，多次钻探，优中选优，力臻尽美尽善。这也表现云霄开拓者的一种锲而不舍的追求，虽然起步维艰，但为了云霄改革大业，大唱山海经，抓两水（水产水果）生产，同时投资开发矿泉水资源。说不定有朝一日，云霄的水果，水产品，乃至于将军山矿泉水，不但走向全国，还会走向世界呢！
    愿云霄早上云霄，前程似锦！
