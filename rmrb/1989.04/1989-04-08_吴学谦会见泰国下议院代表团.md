Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 6th. (Reporter Jiang Lurong) Vice Premier Wu Xueqian commented today on the Vietnamese government's announcement yesterday that it would withdraw its troops from Cambodia by the end of this September, saying, "More importantly, we need to see its actions."

He pointed out that the Cambodian issue was caused by Vietnam's aggression. The key to solving this problem is for Vietnam to truly and quickly withdraw all its troops from Cambodia.

Wu Xueqian made these remarks during a meeting with a delegation from the Thai House of Representatives led by Speaker Bancha Kaewseng.

He highly praised Thailand's significant contributions to achieving a fair, reasonable, and timely resolution to the Cambodian issue. He said that Thailand and other ASEAN countries have played an important role in seeking a political solution to the Cambodian issue. China hopes for long-term peace and stability in Southeast Asia.

Bancha agreed with this view. He said that the Cambodian issue has affected the development and lives of people in Thailand's northeastern region. Additionally, Thailand currently has 300,000 Vietnamese refugees, and Thailand needs to provide them with food and clothing.

Bancha suggested that if the Soviet Union agrees not to support Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia during the upcoming Sino-Soviet summit in mid-May, this issue will be easier to resolve. He hopes the Sino-Soviet summit will be successful.

Wu Xueqian told Bancha that the Cambodian issue will be one of the topics discussed during the Sino-Soviet summit. He hopes the Soviet Union will make greater efforts to politically resolve the Cambodian issue.

During the meeting, Wu Xueqian and Bancha highly praised the friendly and cooperative relationship between China and Thailand, and the close friendship between the two peoples.

　　吴学谦会见泰国下议院代表团
    新华社北京４月６日电  （记者姜鲁榕）国务院副总理吴学谦今天在这里评论越南政府昨天宣布于今年９月底以前从柬埔寨撤军时说，“更重要的是要看它的行动”。
    他指出，柬埔寨问题是由于越南侵略一手造成的。这一问题解决的关键是越南真正、尽快地从柬埔寨全部撤军。
    吴学谦是在会见由班乍·盖索恩通议长率领的泰国下议院代表团时说这些话的。
    他高度评价了泰国为求得公正、合理和尽快地解决柬埔寨问题而作出的巨大贡献，他说，泰国和其它东盟国家为寻求柬埔寨问题的政治解决起了重要作用。中国希望东南亚地区能有一个长期的和平稳定局面。
    班乍对此表示同意。他说，柬埔寨问题影响了泰国东北部地区的发展和人民的生活。另外，现在泰国有３０万越南难民，泰国要为他们提供吃穿。
    班乍提出，在５月中旬的中苏首脑会晤中，如苏联同意不再支持越南侵略柬埔寨，这一问题就会好解决了。他希望中苏首脑会晤获得成功。
    吴学谦告诉班乍，柬埔寨问题将是中苏首脑会晤的议题之一。他希望苏联为政治解决柬埔寨问题做出更大的努力。
    会见中，吴学谦和班乍还高度赞扬中泰两国，两国人民十分亲密的友好合作关系。
