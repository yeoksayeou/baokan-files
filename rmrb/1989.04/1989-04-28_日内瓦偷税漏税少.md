Tax evasion is a serious social problem in many Western countries, including Italy and France. However, the situation in Switzerland, particularly in the canton of Geneva, is quite different. Geneva has 280,000 taxpayers, with tax evaders estimated to be less than a few percent. The canton's GDP in 1987 was 15 billion Swiss francs, with tax revenues reaching 3.5 billion Swiss francs. The government's total budget expenditure was 4 billion Swiss francs, with half of it coming from personal income tax.

A Rigorous Tax System

A rigorous tax system is the fundamental guarantee for the Geneva government to control tax evasion to the maximum extent. Switzerland is a federal country, with the federal government responsible for collecting indirect taxes and the cantons responsible for collecting direct taxes.

Geneva has established a comprehensive and rigorous tax system. In terms of personal income tax collection, its characteristics are:

Both rigorous and tailored to individuals. Geneva's income tax system consists of self-reporting, employer-provided tax certificates, withholding tax, and advance tax payments. Different methods are applied to different types of taxpayers. Generally, permanent residents use the self-reporting and employer-provided tax certificate method. Residents report their income and expenses for the previous year to the tax authorities at the beginning of each year, along with employer-provided certificates, and then pay income tax according to the tax rate. Temporary residents have high mobility, making self-reporting impractical, so the withholding tax method is used, where employers deduct income tax from salaries and remit it to the tax authorities. For income sources that are difficult for tax authorities to monitor, such as bank interest and corporate dividends, the federal government's advance tax system is used to control them. Enterprises or banks withhold 35% of dividends or interest as income tax when distributing them, and remit it to the federal treasury. Doctors, lawyers, street vendors, and other freelancers do not have employers to verify their income, so the state tax bureau has established a professional audit team and a monitoring system to supervise their tax payments.

Linking the tax system with social welfare. This linkage means determining the amount of social welfare benefits based on the income reported by taxpayers. Since insurance companies, as legal entities, are supervised by tax authorities, the income reported by taxpayers to tax authorities and the income for various insurance enrollments must be consistent; otherwise, it will be self-incriminating. This undoubtedly poses an invisible threat to those who may evade taxes in a Western society where traffic accidents are frequent, medical expenses are high, and employment is not secure, thereby becoming a driving force for honest reporting.

Severe Punishments

Tax evasion in Switzerland is considered a criminal offense. Relevant laws stipulate that tax evaders will face penalties of up to ten times the amount of tax evaded (cumulative over five years), in addition to paying the original tax. Meanwhile, judicial authorities will also prosecute tax evaders, imposing sentences of 1 to 30 days in prison. Those who refuse to pay taxes or fines will have their wages garnished, their property seized, or their homes sealed as collateral, until they appeal.

Swiss law also stipulates that those who provide false certificates or facilitate tax evasion will be sentenced to imprisonment or fined, with the maximum fine reaching 30,000 Swiss francs.

Reasonable Tax Rates

Switzerland has numerous tax categories, but they generally fall into two main types: direct and indirect taxes, with direct taxes being the primary type. Direct taxes are mainly personal income taxes. Geneva's personal income tax collection follows the principle of "the more income, the more tax," with tax rates ranging from 0.05% to 38.2%, showing a significant disparity.

Reasonable tax rates not only help narrow the wealth gap and prevent polarization but are also a prerequisite for the smooth implementation of tax policies.

A rigorous tax system, severe punishments, and reasonable tax rates are the main reasons why tax evasion is low in Geneva.

### 日内瓦偷税漏税少

　　日内瓦偷税漏税少
    新华社记者  施光耀
    偷税漏税在意大利、法国等不少西方国家是个严重的社会问题。但是在瑞士，尤其是日内瓦州，情况则截然不同。日内瓦州共计有２８万名纳税人，偷税漏税者估计不足百分之几；该州１９８７年国民生产总值１５０亿瑞士法郎，各项税务收入达３５亿瑞士法郎；政府预算开支总额４０亿瑞士法郎，有一半靠个人所得税收入。
    严密的税制
    严密的税制是日内瓦州政府得以最大限度地控制偷漏税收的根本保证。瑞士是个联邦制国家，联邦政府负责征收间接税，各州政府负责征收直接税。
    日内瓦州建立了一整套严密的税制。就征收个人所得税的税制而言，它的特点是：
    既严密又因人而异。日内瓦州的所得税制由自我申报、雇主证明纳税、代扣所得税和预交税等方法组成。对不同性质的纳税人实行不同的纳税方法。一般情况下，常住居民采用自我申报雇主证明纳税法。居民每年年初对其头年的各项收入和支出向税务部门如实申报，并附上雇主的证明，然后根据税率交纳所得税。临时居民流动性大，自我申报制不适用，就采用代扣所得税制，即由雇主在发放薪水时代扣所得税，交税务部门。对有些来源保密的收入，如银行利息、企业股息等，税务部门难以掌握，就借助于联邦政府的预支税制来加以控制。企业或银行在发放股息或利息时就预先从中扣除３５％，作为所得税，上交联邦政府国库。医生、律师、小贩等自由职业者没有雇主，亦无人能证明他们的确切收入，为此，州财税厅专门成立了一支专业稽查员队伍，设立了一套监督系统，对他们的纳税情况加以监督。
    将税制与社会福利挂钩。所谓挂钩，就是根据纳税人申报收入数额来决定其享受社会福利待遇的多少。由于保险公司作为法人受到税务部门的监督，所以纳税人向税务部门申报的收入和加入各项保险的收入必须统一，否则便会不打自招。这在交通事故频繁、医疗费用高昂和就业缺乏保障的西方社会里，无疑对有偷税漏税可能的人形成了一种无形的威胁，从而成为一种促使大家如实申报的动力。
    严厉的惩罚
    偷税漏税在瑞士纯属犯罪行为，有关法律明文规定，偷逃税者将受到最多可达１０倍于偷漏税额（按５年累计）的重罚，此外还要补交原来的税金。同时，司法部门还将对偷逃税者绳之以法，判其１至３０天监禁。凡是拒不交纳税金或罚款者，税务部门可扣其工资，可上门抄收家产或查封房屋作为抵押，直至上诉。
    瑞士法律还规定，凡是出具假证明、为偷税漏税者提供方便者，将被判处徒刑或罚款，其数额最高可达３万瑞士法郎。
    合理的税率
    瑞士的税收名目繁多，但总的可归为两大类，即直接税和间接税，其中以直接税为主。而直接税又以个人所得税为主。日内瓦州征收个人所得税，以收入少纳税少、收入多纳税多为原则，其税率从０．０５％至３８．２％不等，差距悬殊。
    合理的税率不但能够缩小贫富差距，避免两极分化，而且也是确保税务政策顺利贯彻的先决条件。
    严密的税制、严厉的惩罚和合理的税率，是日内瓦州偷税漏税少的主要秘诀之所在。
