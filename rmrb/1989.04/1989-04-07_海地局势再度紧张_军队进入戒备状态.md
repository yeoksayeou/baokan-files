Haiti's situation has tensed again, with the military entering a state of high alert.

	The Haitian government announced this afternoon the suspension of constitutional guarantees and the implementation of news censorship. Meanwhile, the military has been ordered to enter the highest state of alert.

	According to a report by Mexico City's television station: A battalion sympathetic to the coup in Haiti today issued a statement through the "Metropolitan" radio station at noon, accusing Haiti's ruling council chairman Avril of being responsible for the deaths of four military officers in the resistance against the coup; demanding Avril's resignation. Otherwise, they will take action again. This development led the government to issue a curfew, suspending commercial activities, and requiring residents to stay at home. The instability of the regime has caused Haiti's situation to tense again. The Dominican Republic has also expressed concern over the entry of Haitian hostile forces into its territory.

　　海地局势再度紧张  军队进入戒备状态
    本报墨西哥城４月５日电  记者郭伟成报道：海地政府今天下午宣布停止宪法保障，实行新闻检查。与此同时，军队已奉命进入最高戒备状态。
    据墨西哥城电视台报道：海地一营同情政变的部队今天中午通过“都市”广播电台发表一项公告，指责海地执政委员会主席阿夫里尔对政变后军队对抗中死去的４名军官负有责任；要求阿夫里尔辞职。否则，他们将再次兴师问罪。这一事态导致政府发布戒严令，停止了商业活动，居民被要求留在家中。政权不稳，使得海地局势再度趋于紧张状态。多米尼加共和国也对海地敌对军人进入该国表示不安。
