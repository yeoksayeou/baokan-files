Column: Investigation and Reflection

Last year, in the various counties and cities of Shangrao, Jiangxi, there were more than 2,000 serious incidents of unreasonable verbal abuse and assaults on commercial and industrial administration personnel. Among these, 115 individuals were assaulted, 51 were injured, and 13 were hospitalized. The main reasons for these incidents are as follows:

First, some lawbreakers, after being dealt with, harbored resentment and took out their anger on the commercial and industrial administration personnel, resorting to revenge. Second, ineffective handling. Incidents of lawbreakers assaulting commercial and industrial administration personnel are generally treated as civil disputes for mediation. Relevant departments, when handling such cases, often drag their feet and delay making decisions, or simply detain the relevant parties for a few days to settle the matter, allowing the lawbreakers' arrogance to flourish. Third, inadequate propaganda. Some units and individual business households view normal fees and penalties as arbitrary charges and fines. They neither listen to the explanations of the commercial and industrial administration personnel nor act in accordance with commercial regulations. Fourth, some commercial and industrial administration personnel have poor quality, use simple work methods, and have a harsh attitude, leading to the escalation of conflicts.

I believe that relevant departments should strengthen legal education to make every citizen consciously abide by laws and regulations, allowing commercial and industrial administration personnel to carry out their duties normally. For those lawbreakers with serious criminal acts, they must be severely punished without leniency. The commercial and industrial administration departments should actively coordinate with public security, taxation, urban construction, health, and metrology departments to ensure that relevant departments understand and support the work of the commercial and industrial administration departments. At the same time, the commercial and industrial administration departments should take measures to improve team building, establish a reporting system, accept public supervision, and ensure their own integrity.

### 工商行政管理人员为何屡屡被打

　　工商行政管理人员为何屡屡被打
    去年，江西上饶地区各县市相继发生２０００多起无理谩骂、殴打工商行政管理人员的严重事件。其中，被打的有１１５人次，打伤５１人，住院１３人。主要原因有以下几点：
    一是一些不法分子被查处后，心怀不满，于是对工商行政管理人员大打出手，实行报复。二是处置不力。不法分子殴打工商行政管理人员的事件，一般被作为民事纠纷调解，有关部门受理这类案件，又往往久拖不决，迟迟不作处理，或者将有关当事人拘留几天了事，致使不法分子的气焰十分嚣张。三是宣传不够。有的单位和个体工商户把正常的收费、处罚，视为乱收费、乱罚款，既不听工商行政管理人员的解释，又不按工商法规办事。四是有些工商行政管理人员素质差，工作方法简单，态度生硬，致使矛盾激化。
    我认为，有关部门应加强法制教育，使每个公民自觉遵纪守法，使工商行政管理人员能正常执行任务，履行职责。对于那些犯罪情节严重的不法分子，要严厉打击，绝不宽容。工商行政管理部门要积极与公安、税务、城建、卫生、计量等部门联系，使有关部门了解和支持工商行政管理部门的工作。同时，工商行政管理部门应采取措施搞好队伍建设，建立举报制度，接受群众监督，保证自身廉洁。
