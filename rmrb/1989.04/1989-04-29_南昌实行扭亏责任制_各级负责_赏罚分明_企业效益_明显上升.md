Nanchang Implements Loss-Reduction Responsibility System
	All Levels Take Responsibility, Rewards and Punishments Clear
	Enterprise Efficiency Significantly Improves

	BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) — The industrial and commercial system in Nanchang has established a loss-reduction responsibility system at all levels, achieving good results in enterprise loss-reduction and profit-increase work. The number of loss-making enterprises within the budget last year decreased by 34 percent compared to the previous year, and this year's first quarter saw a further 35 percent decrease.

	The municipal government has set loss-reduction targets for each supervising bureau and county-level districts under its jurisdiction, implementing a system where the head of each level is responsible. For counties and districts that complete the loss-reduction targets, a one-time reward is given, and enterprise leaders' salaries are increased. For the 26 factories that did not complete the loss-reduction targets, the leaders' salaries are deducted, and enterprise employees do not receive bonuses. For enterprises that are not effective in loss-reduction, the responsible persons are adjusted or replaced, and 40 enterprises have had their property rights transferred, allowing stronger enterprises to take them over.
