The Ministry of Civil Affairs recently issued an emergency notice to urgently arrange for the living conditions of the disaster-stricken areas.

Last year, China experienced frequent natural disasters, resulting in significant losses and leaving many problems for this year. Currently, it is the critical period of the year when food supplies are scarce, and the task of arranging living conditions for the disaster-stricken areas has become urgent.

The notice requires that during the spring drought period, relief grain and funds must be promptly distributed to the disaster victims. The allocation of grain and funds must focus on key areas. This year, the spring drought affects a large area with many difficulties. Local authorities must strictly control the scope of relief efforts and prioritize the most severely affected households that lack both food and money and have no self-rescue capabilities. The practice of distributing relief indiscriminately or favoring relatives and friends must be strictly prohibited.

At the same time, attention must be paid to promptly addressing any loopholes in the allocation of grain and funds to prevent the expansion of the spring drought and the occurrence of unexpected incidents.

The notice also proposes actively organizing disaster victims to engage in self-rescue and mutual aid. Local authorities in the disaster-stricken areas must focus on arranging labor forces, ensuring spring planting while also promoting various sideline and auxiliary industries to expand income sources and enhance the ability to endure the drought.

    本报北京４月１９日讯　民政部日前发出抓紧灾区群众生活安排的紧急通知。
    去年，我国自然灾害频繁，损失比较严重，给今年遗留下来的问题不少。目前，正处于青黄不接的紧张季节，安排灾区群众生活的工作已进入关键时刻。
    通知要求，在春荒期间把救灾粮款迅速落实到灾民手中。粮款安排要保证重点。今年春荒面大，困难多，各地在安排生活救济时要严格控制救济面，重点保证既缺粮缺钱又没有自救能力的重灾户。对平均发放、优亲厚友的问题要严加制止。
    同时，要特别注意随时弥补粮款安排中出现的漏洞，以求得解决，防止春荒扩大和发生意外事件。
    通知提出积极组织灾民生产自救，发动互助互济。灾区各地要抓好劳力安排，在搞好春耕生产的同时，尽量开展一些工副业生产，扩大收入来源，增强度荒能力。
