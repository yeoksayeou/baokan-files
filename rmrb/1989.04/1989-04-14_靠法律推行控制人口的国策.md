Title: Implementing Population Control Through Legal Means

Since the rural reform, the population in our town has been largely uncontrolled. Particularly in 1986 and 1987, the number of births each year exceeded 800, with half of these being over the limit. Some households, in order to have a boy, have given birth to as many as six children and still do not stop. If this trend continues, in just 20 years, not to mention other social problems, the issue of food supply alone will be unsolvable. Villages like Ta Yu Gorge, North Tangchi, Front Tangchi, and Erdaohe in our town were once separate, but over the past decade, due to the increase in new housing, these villages have merged into one. However, the arable land is decreasing. This is a common phenomenon. The problem of concealing and underreporting over-limit births is quite serious, and there are many "black children" who have not been registered. Witnessing the severe situation of population control, every responsible and conscientious citizen is deeply worried.

In recent years, although grassroots cadres have worked hard, the problem of over-limit births has not been solved. To complete the birth control tasks assigned by higher authorities, based on propaganda and education, town and village cadres often take some punitive measures against those who are unreasonable. As a result, there is a serious confrontation between grassroots cadres and the masses. Many village cadres have been beaten and cursed, and some have even been injured by those being punished. I myself, while executing the duty of punishing over-limit births, have been insulted, bitten by dogs, and had my family's windows broken at night, making the whole family feel unsafe. For this, I have been blamed by my family. Higher authorities advocate that couples of childbearing age undergo sterilization surgery, but some people are unwilling to accept it. Some who are forced to accept it complain and cause trouble after the surgery, making grassroots cadres very troubled. Moreover, each sterilization case requires more than 200 yuan in compensation, plus subsidies for accompanying personnel and medical expenses. If this continues, just this item will exhaust the town and village funds.

In view of this, it is urgently hoped that the state will legislate on family planning. Without enacting a law that primarily uses economic sanctions and supplementary criminal penalties, the basic national policy of family planning will be in vain. This family planning law should clearly stipulate that the fines for over-limit births will be determined by the local government and collected in one lump sum from the responsible party. Those who cannot or refuse to pay will be subject to criminal penalties by the relevant departments, making citizens deterred by the law and not daring to have over-limit births. It should be known that relying on propaganda and education can only make some people voluntarily practice family planning, but there will always be others who, for various reasons, cannot be persuaded, and only through legal means can the population be controlled. Otherwise, like the current situation where only grassroots cadres do the work, it will not achieve the expected goal of implementing the basic national policy.

### 靠法律推行控制人口的国策

　　靠法律推行控制人口的国策
    我镇从农村体制改革以来，人口基本失控，尤其是１９８６和１９８７年，每年出生人口８００人以上，其中超生占一半，有的户为了生个男孩，竟生了６胎还不罢休。照这样下去，再过２０年，其它社会问题姑且不说，仅口粮问题就无法解决。我镇的塔峪沟、北汤池、前汤池、二道河村过去都是不相连的村落，近十几年来，由于新建民宅增多，这几个村子已连成一片，可耕种的土地却越来越少，这是普遍存在的事实。瞒报、漏报超生人口问题相当严重，没上户口的“黑孩子”为数不少。目睹人口失控的严重局面，每个有责任感和良知的公民无不忧心忡忡。
    近几年来，虽然基层干部努力工作，但超生始终未能解决。为完成上级下达的节育任务，在宣传教育的基础上，镇村干部对个别不讲理的人，往往采取一些处罚措施，结果使基层干部与群众严重对立，不少村干部因此挨打受骂，甚至被受罚户砍伤，得不到法律的有力支持和保护。我个人在执行处罚超生户公务时，也曾被辱骂，被恶犬所咬，家里门窗玻璃半夜被人砸碎，全家都没有安全感，为此饱受家人埋怨。上级号召育龄夫妇实施结扎手术，但有的群众不愿接受。有的免强接受，术后无病呻吟，寻衅滋事，使基层干部大伤脑筋。再则结扎一例要给受术者２００元以上滋养费，加上陪护人员补贴、药费补贴，长此下去，仅此一项开支就使得镇、村经费濒于枯竭。
    鉴于此，亟盼国家对计划生育立法。不颁布一个以经济制裁为主，以刑罚为辅的有威慑力的大法，计划生育这一基本国策就会落空。这个计划生育法应明确规定，对超生户的罚款由地方政府确定，向当事人作一次性收缴，交不齐或拒交者，即由有关部门依法给予刑事处罚，使公民因慑于法律而不敢盲目超生。须知，靠宣传教育只能使一部分人自觉实行计划生育，而总有另一些人基于各种原因是说服不了的，只能诉诸法律，才能把人口控制下来。否则像目前这样只靠基层干部做工作，是达不到落实基本国策的预期目的的。
