As the relationship across the Taiwan Strait shows signs of easing, the frequent exchanges between people on both sides have given rise to some legal issues that have attracted the attention of relevant parties on both sides. Today, the All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots and the Institute of Law at Renmin University of China jointly invited more than 60 experts and scholars from 16 units in Beijing to further discuss the draft of the "Temporary Regulations on Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Region and the Mainland Region" (hereinafter referred to as the "Draft Regulations") that Taiwan has been hurriedly drafting recently.

It is reported that this is the first time such a large-scale discussion has been held by the mainland. Relevant parties believe that this is a necessity for the objective development of exchanges and economic interactions between people on both sides, and a manifestation of the deepening of relations across the Taiwan Strait.

Professor Wu Shuqing, Vice President of Renmin University of China, pointed out that the "Draft Regulations" is the first time in recent years that the Taiwan authorities have systematically legislated on cross-strait relations. It reflects the overall attitude and specific practices of the Taiwan authorities towards the development of cross-strait relations. Once this draft is formally legislated, it will have a significant impact on the development of cross-strait relations.

Liao Qiuzhong, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots, said that laws are extremely serious, and making laws requires great caution. In the absence of communication between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, it is very inappropriate for the Taiwan authorities to legislate unilaterally on cross-strait relations. He believes that solving such major issues requires negotiations between both sides. However, the Taiwan authorities have always insisted on the "three nos" policy, refusing to negotiate, and thus unable to achieve official communication between the two sides.

Several scholars attending the meeting suggested that, given the current situation of cross-strait relations, it might be possible to establish a civilian or semi-official association or organization to contact and dialogue with the corresponding institutions in Taiwan to discuss legal issues related to exchanges between people on both sides.

Professor Gao Mingxuan, Vice President of the China Law Society, analyzed the "Draft Regulations" item by item and believed that although the document has some positive factors, there are also many negative, unreasonable, and erroneous provisions. He said that the draft regulations are self-deceptive and overreaching on the issue of "legitimacy." It is obviously "against the law" to prohibit civil activities between the two sides with criminal penalties. As for stripping Communist Party members and other democratic party members of their inheritance rights, it is even more unreasonable to bring political bias into legal issues.

Professor Jiang Ping, President of the China University of Political Science and Law and Vice Chairman of the Legislative Affairs Commission of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, believes that the "Draft Regulations" essentially acknowledges the legal effect of civil arbitration decisions and civil judgments from the mainland, reflecting the shift of the Taiwan authorities from a policy of ostrich-like avoidance to some relaxation, gradually acknowledging the changes in reality. He pointed out that this draft mainly involves individual citizens between the two sides; while it is vague about groups and legal persons. This contradiction shows the helplessness of the Taiwan authorities in dealing with judicial issues.

National Committee members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Jia Yibin, National Committee member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Member of the Standing Committee of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League Wu Ketao, Vice President of the Supreme People's Court Zhu Mingshan, and others attended today's seminar.

### 围绕台“两岸人民关系条例草案”  首都专家学者各抒己见

　　围绕台“两岸人民关系条例草案”    
    首都专家学者各抒己见
    本报北京４月２６日讯  记者郑固固、任之报道：随着海峡两岸关系出现松动，两岸人民往来日渐频繁，衍发产生出的一些法律问题已经引起两岸有关方面的重视。今天，全国台联和中国人民大学法律问题研究所联合邀集在京１６单位的６０余位专家学者，对台湾近来加紧研制的《台湾地区与大陆地区人民关系暂行条例草案》（下简称《关系条例草案》）进行进一步研讨。
    据悉，大陆民间举行如此规模的研讨尚属首次。有关人士认为，这是两岸人员往来、经济交流客观发展的需要，是两岸关系发展深入的表现。
    人大副校长吴树青教授指出，《关系条例草案》是近年来台湾官方第一次用系统立法的形式对两岸关系问题作出的系统规定，它集中地反映了台湾当局对两岸关系发展的总体态度和一些具体做法。此条例草案一旦正式立法，必将对两岸关系的发展产生重大影响。
    全国台联副会长廖秋忠说，法律是极其严肃的，制定法律更需非常严谨。在海峡两岸双方尚未沟通的情况下，台湾当局单方面就两岸关系立法是很不合时宜的。他认为，解决这样的重大问题需要双方来商谈。而台湾当局一贯僵持“三不”政策，拒绝谈判，无法实现两岸官方的沟通。
    多位与会学者建议，在两岸关系的现实情况下，是否可以成立一个民间或带有半官方色彩的协会或团体，与台湾方面相应的机构接触对话，以商讨两岸人民往来的法律问题。
    中国法学会副会长高铭暄教授逐条详细分析了《关系条例草案》后认为，尽管此文件有一些积极因素，但是消极的、不合理的和错误的规定也很多。他说，该条例草案在“法统”问题上自欺欺人，不自量力。对两岸间从事经贸活动的民事行为以刑事处罚加以禁止，显然“有违法理”。而对于共产党员及其他民主党派成员剥夺继承权，则更是将政治偏见引入法律问题，毫无道理。
    中国政法大学校长、全国人大常委会法制工作委员会副主任江平教授认为，《关系条例草案》实质上承认了大陆民事仲裁决定和民事判决的法律效力，体现出台湾当局从鸵鸟政策到有所松动，逐渐承认现状的变化。他指出，这个条例草案主要仅仅涉及两岸的公民个人；而对团体、法人则含糊其辞。这个矛盾显示了台湾当局在处理解决司法问题上的无奈心情。
    全国政协常委、民革中央副主席贾亦斌、全国政协常委、台盟主席团委员吴克泰、最高人民法院副院长祝铭山等出席了今天的研讨会。
