Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 5th.

The chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, Doi, proposed on April 4th at a press conference in the Diet that the Socialist Party, Komeito, Democratic Socialist Party, and the Socialist Mass Party, along with various sectors of the public, form a "National United Government Council" to promote clean politics.

According to reports, Doi also called for a national conference to be held by the four opposition parties and various public groups before April 20th to push for the implementation of a general election. She will seek cooperation from the four opposition parties at a meeting of party leaders in Kyoto on April 7th. Doi pointed out that due to the expansion of the Recruit scandal and the implementation of the consumption tax, the public strongly demands the resignation of the entire Takeshita cabinet or the dissolution of the House of Representatives to hold a general election. She emphasized that working together to deal with political changes "is the shared responsibility of all opposition parties."

This time, the largest opposition party, the Socialist Party, proposed the establishment of a "National United Government Council," which has sparked discussions among opposition parties about forming a united government.

　　日本社会党委员长
    呼吁在野党合作以应付政局转换
    新华社东京４月５日电  日本社会党委员长土井４日在国会的记者招待会上提出，由社会党、公明党、民社党、社民联４个在野党与国民各界组成“国民联合政权协议会”，以促进廉洁政治。
    据此间报道，土井还呼吁在４月２０日以前，由４个在野党和国民各团体联合召开国民大会，促成实施议会总选举。她将于７日在京都召开的４个在野党首脑会议上就此求得各党的合作。土井指出，由于利库路特案涉嫌面的扩大以及消费税的实施，国民强烈要求竹下内阁全体辞职，或解散众议院，实行总选举。她强调说，携手应付政局转换，“是各在野党的共同责任”。
    此次第一大在野党社会党又提出“国民联合政权协议会”的动议，使在野党之间就建立联合政权的议论高涨起来。
