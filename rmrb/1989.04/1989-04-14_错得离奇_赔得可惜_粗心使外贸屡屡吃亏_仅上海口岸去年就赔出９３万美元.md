Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 13th — (Reporter Li Zhenghua) It wasn't due to poor quality or delayed delivery; it was purely because of carelessness. Whether it was a miswritten number on the packaging, incorrect weight, or the wrong packaging bag, the result was that hard-earned foreign exchange was squandered. Last year, Shanghai's port alone had to pay out $936,000 in compensation due to such reasons.

The Yinfeng Woolen Textile Factory exported over 20,000 meters of women's suiting to Australia. The quality of the products met all export requirements, and the goods were shipped on time. However, the foreign buyer soon reported that the goods were stained with white spots, demanding a return and compensation. The factory was shocked and unable to find the cause of the stains. An export staff member, during a visit, retrieved some white powder from the sealed goods pile and had it tested. It turned out that during packaging, the shipping staff mistakenly gave bleaching powder instead of camphor powder to the warehouse staff, who, without careful inspection, sprinkled the powder into the boxes. As a result, the powder seeped into the fabric, staining it. Ultimately, Yinfeng Factory had to settle the dispute by paying over $4,800 in compensation.

Shanghai Yimin Food Factory produced a batch of chicken egg and apricot biscuits for export. Workers in the relevant process mixed 36,000 expired bags, marked with the expiration date "86.3-87.9," into new bags marked "88.2-90.2." These expired bags accounted for 1/4 of the packaging needed for this batch of exported products. Such a large quantity went unnoticed during packaging, and the goods were shipped abroad without any issues. However, the foreign customer discovered the problem upon receiving the goods and demanded the destruction of the batch. After multiple explanations, the customer agreed to allow the reprocessing of 500 boxes of biscuits and the return of these products. This resulted in an economic loss of over $5,000 for our side, equivalent to half the production cost of this batch of products.

Similar packaging "carelessness" occurred 40 times in Shanghai last year, with compensation amounting to $239,000.

　　错得离奇　赔得可惜
　　粗心使外贸屡屡吃亏
　　仅上海口岸去年就赔出９３万美元
    据新华社上海４月１３日电　（记者李正华）不是因为质量低劣，也不是因为拖延交货，完全是由于粗心大意；或包装上写错一个数码，或重量不闪，或装错包装袋等，结果已经到手的外汇又大把大把地赔了出去。上海口岸去年出口的商品中，由于这类原因共向外商赔款９３．６万美元。
    寅丰毛纺织厂出口澳大利亚的２万多米女衣呢，质量全部符合出口要求，产品按期装箱出国。但不久外商却来电说，货物沾染白色污渍，要求退货、赔款。厂方大为吃惊，又查不出污渍的来由。一位外销员趁出访之际，特地到被封的货物堆旁取回白色粉末，经化验才真相大白。原来产品装箱时，发货员错把漂白助剂粉当作樟脑粉配给仓库员，仓库员也不细查就往箱内撒，结果粉末渗入呢包，玷了呢面。最后，这场纠纷只好由寅丰厂赔款４８００多美元了结。
    上海益民食品四厂生产一批出口鸡蛋杏元饼干。有关工序的工人把３．６万只印着有效期“８６．３—８７．９”的过期口袋，混入有效期“８８．２—９０．２”的新口袋中。这些过期口袋相当于这批出口产品所需包装的１／４。这么大的一批数量，包装时竟无一人发现，直到装运出国，一路畅行无阻。但国外客商一接到货物就发现了这个问题，并提出要就地销毁这批食品。经过多次说明，对方教育允许重新生产５００箱饼干，调回这些产品。由此我方经济损失５０００多美元，相当于这批产品成效额的一半。
    类似这种包装上的“粗心”，上海去年就发生４０起，赔款数额达２３．９万美元。
