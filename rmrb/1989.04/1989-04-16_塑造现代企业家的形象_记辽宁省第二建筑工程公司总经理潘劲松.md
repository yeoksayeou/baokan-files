	Shaping the Image of a Modern Entrepreneur
	– A Profile of Pan Jinsong, General Manager of Liaoning Provincial Second Construction Engineering Company

	“Little Pan, you have great ambitions, which is good, but people say you have a bit of a flamboyant style!”

	One afternoon, an old leader patted Pan Jinsong on the shoulder and said these words with a heavy heart. However, Pan Jinsong didn't quite understand.

	“Some people say you rarely go to the construction sites. Be careful! We are a construction company, and I still say: a good manager should first be a hands-on manager.”

	Since becoming the general manager of Liaoning Provincial Second Construction Engineering Company, Pan Jinsong had been busy expanding operations, and indeed, he had less time to visit the construction sites.

	After a moment of silence, Pan Jinsong spoke: “The hands-on manager that you have always admired, I think, should not be promoted. A hands-on manager should not be the model for managers. I don't oppose enterprise leaders getting down to the ground to direct production, but to evaluate an enterprise leader by how many times he has visited the construction sites, without considering the economic benefits of his enterprise or understanding his management strategies, is not the way to cultivate high-level management talent.”

	What made this leader unhappy was not just that Pan Jinsong's views differed from his. After that conversation, in the following month, Pan Jinsong only went to the construction sites 12 times. What was he busy with? In the words of this old leader, he wasn't focusing on the right things. Pan Jinsong was indeed busy with things not directly related to engineering. He first went up to the new office building in the front courtyard, mobilizing all 60-plus office staff to move downstairs, squeezing into the company's original office building to work. He then renovated the vacated office building into a guesthouse with 100 beds. As soon as the guesthouse was completed, he went to the company's rear courtyard to the staff hospital, setting up a specialized hospital for treating burn patients. Thus, a 30-plus bed hospital opened to the public. During this period, he initiated a total of 38 non-engineering business projects.

	As if by fate, the non-engineering business projects initiated by Pan Jinsong were all profitable. Just the guesthouse and hospital alone increased profits by over 300,000 yuan each year.

	At this time, there were more “reflections.” The leader found him and said, “Someone reflected that you are not focusing on your main business, Little Pan!”

	Before Pan Jinsong took office, the company only made a profit of 480,000 yuan, and there were no such reflections. He increased the profit to 1,000,000 yuan, and the reflections came one after another. He couldn't care less about the conversation's tone and retorted to the leader, “I didn't focus on my main business, but I made the enterprise's output value and profit increase several times. This shows that my management level is still acceptable!”

	This leader was obviously unhappy and opened a small notebook: “Someone reflected that since you came to the Second Company, you have ‘four ones’: you wrote a book; you got a pay raise; you were allocated a house (two rooms); you bought a car. These are probably all true, and this should be noted. You are still young, and if you're not careful, it will affect your progress.”

	Pan Jinsong did not explain each point but only told the leader, “These four things are all true, and none of them violate any regulations. I can manage a large company while easily writing a large volume of management books. I think such a thing at least should not be criticized.”

	Pan Jinsong has been the manager for three years, and Liaoning Provincial Second Construction Engineering Company has also made a name for itself with “four ones”: output value increased by one fold; labor productivity per capita increased by one fold; profit realized increased by one fold; the rate of excellent projects has been ranked first in Shenyang City for three consecutive years. What should a factory director or manager be like? People are used to evaluating with traditional standards, but Pan Jinsong is not influenced by these and is shaping his image with the spirit of a modern entrepreneur.

　　塑造现代企业家的形象
　　——记辽宁省第二建筑工程公司总经理潘劲松
　　杨集才
    “小潘啊，你有雄心壮志，这很好，但人们反映，你作风有些漂啊”！
    一天下午，一位老领导拍着潘劲松的肩膀说了这番语重心长的话，可是，潘劲松却不大明白。
    “有人说你很少跑工地，要提防点哟！我们是建筑施工企业啊，我还是那句话：一个好经理，首先应该是泥腿子经理。”
    潘劲松自从当上辽宁省第二建筑工程公司总经理，一直忙着开拓经营，下工地的时间确实少了。
    静场了半天，潘劲松说话了：“你们多年来一直欣赏的泥腿子经理，我以为不应该提倡，泥腿子经理不应该成为经营者的典范，我不反对企业领导干部深入实际指挥生产，但考核一个企业干部只统计他下过几次工地，而不问他的企业的经济效益，不了解他的经营谋略，那是培养不出高层次的管理人才的。”让这位领导不高兴的不仅是潘劲松的观点与他不一致。从打那次谈话之后的一个月时间，潘劲松只去了１２次工地。他干什么去了？用这位老领导的话说，都没忙在点子上。　潘劲松忙的事的确与工程关系不大密切，他先是登上前院的新办公楼，把里边６０多名机关干部全部动员下楼，让他们挤进公司原办公楼办公，把腾出的办公楼重新装饰，办成一个有１００张床位的招待所。招待所的事情刚刚办完，他又来到公司后院的职工医院，办了一个治疗烧伤病人的专科医院，这样，一个３０多张床位的医院对外开业了。这期间，他共搞了３８项建筑工程外的经营项目。
    天遂人愿，潘劲松创办的这些工程外的经营项目，个个盈利，光是招待所，医院每年就增创利润３０多万元。
    这时，又有“反映”了。领导同志找到他说：“有人反映你不务正业啊，小潘！”
    潘劲松上任前，公司只盈利４８０万元，没听到什么反映，他把利润搞到１０００万元，“反映”却接踵而来。他顾不得谈话的分寸了，回敬领导一句：“我没务正业，却使企业产值利润成倍增长，这说明我的管理水平还说得过去！……”
    这位领导显然不高兴了，他展开一个小本子：有人反映你到二公司之后有“四个一”：写了一本书；长了一级工资；分了一套（两间）住房；买了一辆轿车。这恐怕都是事实吧，这要引起注意啊，你还年轻，弄不好，会影响你的进步的。”
    潘劲松没有一条一条地解释，只是告诉这位领导：“这四件事没有一条不真实，也没有一条违反哪条规定。我能在管理一个大公司的同时，轻松地写出一大部头管理方面的书，我认为这样的事情至少不能挨批评。”
    潘劲松当经理３年，辽宁省第二建筑工程公司也以“四个一”令人注目：产值增长一倍；全员劳动效率增长一倍；实现利润增长一倍；单位工程优良品率连续３年被评为沈阳市第一名。厂长、经理应当什么样？人们已经习惯于用传统的标准来评价，而潘劲松不为这些所左右，正在用现代企业家的精神塑造着自己的形象。
