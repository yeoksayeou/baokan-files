For a long time, people have been puzzled by the strong navigational abilities of homing pigeons, which even surpass modern aircraft navigation systems. Recently, scientists have discovered a layer of magnetic mineral particles within the pigeons' skulls, which is likely the reason for their accurate directional flight.

Pigeons fly at an altitude of approximately 1,000 meters and at a speed of 100 kilometers per hour (reaching 200 kilometers per hour during races). Therefore, since ancient times, people have used pigeons to transmit messages. In medieval Europe and during the Tang and Song dynasties in China, the use of homing pigeons in warfare was quite common. Later, although airplanes and modern communication systems emerged, homing pigeons still play an important role in information transmission. In the city of Lille, France, there is a monument dedicated to the homing pigeons that sacrificed their lives to transmit intelligence to enemy-occupied areas during World War I.

In peacetime, aside from organizing pigeon races, people also use homing pigeons in scientific research. For example, in emergency situations, homing pigeons can be used to deliver blood samples.

　　信鸽定向飞行之谜
    长期以来，人们不了解信鸽的定向航行能力为什么那么强，甚至超过现代飞机的导航系统。最近科学家发现，在信鸽头骨内部有一层微粒状的磁铁矿物质，这大概就是信鸽能够准确定向飞行的原因。
    鸽子的飞行高度约１０００米，时速１００公里（比赛时达２００公里）。所以，自古以来，人们就用鸽子传递信息。在中世纪的欧洲和我国唐宋时代，信鸽用于战事已相当普遍。后来，虽然出现了飞机和现代通讯系统，但信鸽在传送信息方面仍起着重要作用。法国里尔市有一座纪念碑，就是专门纪念在第一次世界大战中向敌占区传送情报而光荣献身的信鸽的。
    在和平环境里，人们除了组织赛鸽等活动外，还在科研战线上使用信鸽。如在紧急情况下利用信鸽送血样（见图）。
