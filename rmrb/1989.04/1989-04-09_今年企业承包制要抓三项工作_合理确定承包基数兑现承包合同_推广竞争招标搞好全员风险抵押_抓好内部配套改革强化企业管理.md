		Three Key Tasks for Enterprise Contracting System in 1989
		Rationalize the Base Number for Contracting and Fulfill Contract Obligations
		Promote Competitive Bidding and Implement Full-Employee Risk Guarantee
		Strengthen Internal Supporting Reforms and Enhance Enterprise Management

		BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The State Commission for Economic Restructuring has revealed that the focus of enterprise reform this year will be to address the problems and difficulties in the contracting system, and to further develop and improve the contracting responsibility system. Deputy Director Zhang Yanning of the commission introduced several key tasks for improving the contracting system today:

		Rationalize the base number for contracting and fulfill contract obligations. Over the next two years, approximately 80% of enterprise contracts will expire. The new round of enterprise contracting will follow national industrial policies and contracting regulations, and will refer to the capital tax rate and industrial net output rate of the same industry in the same region or city. As much as possible, the base number for contracting will be determined through bidding. The fulfillment of contracts will first undergo auditing to avoid the issue of nominal profits but actual losses. For enterprises that fail to complete their contracts, the income of managers and employees should fluctuate with economic performance.

		Promote competitive bidding and implement full-employee risk guarantee. Through competitive bidding for contracting, select the best managers and optimize the contracting plan. Special attention should be given to large and medium-sized enterprises to ensure standardization, institutionalization, and reduce administrative intervention. It is advocated that in enterprises facing operational difficulties and significant external changes, a full-employee risk guarantee system should be implemented to share risks between managers and employees.

		Strengthen internal supporting reforms and enhance enterprise management. Continue to push forward reforms in enterprise leadership systems, distribution systems, and personnel and labor systems. Actively and steadily promote the optimization of labor combinations to achieve a rational labor organization structure and personnel allocation. Establish a mechanism where positions are competed for and income is linked to contributions. Starting from management, take specific measures to address issues such as lax labor discipline, high material consumption, and low capital utilization efficiency. Persistently work to achieve results.

　　今年企业承包制要抓三项工作
    合理确定承包基数兑现承包合同
    推广竞争招标搞好全员风险抵押
    抓好内部配套改革强化企业管理
    新华社北京４月８日电  （记者吴士深）记者从国家体改委获悉，今年企业深化改革的重点是针对承包中存在的问题和难点采取相应对策，配套、完善、深化和发展承包经营责任制。国家体改委副主任张彦宁今天在这里介绍了抓好承包制的几项工作目标：
    合理确定承包基数，认真兑现承包合同。今明两年约有８０％的企业承包合同到期。新一轮企业承包将按照国家产业政策和承包条例的规定，参照本地区、本城市同行业资金利税率和工业净产值率，尽可能地采取招标的办法确定承包基数。合同兑现首先要进行审计，避免虚盈实亏。对未完成合同的企业，要做到经营者和职工收入随经济效益的好坏浮动。
    推广竞争招标，搞好全员风险抵押。通过竞争招标承包，优选经营者，优化承包方案。特别要抓好大中型企业的招标承包，尽量做到规范化、制度化、减少行政干预。提倡在经营困难、外部条件变化较大的企业中实行全员风险抵押，使经营者和职工共担风险。
    抓好企业内部配套改革，强化企业管理。继续推进企业内部领导体制、分配制度、人事劳动制度的改革，积极稳妥地推行优化劳动组合，实现劳动组织结构和人员配置的合理化，形成岗位靠竞争，收入争贡献的机制。从管理入手，对劳动纪律松弛、物资消耗高和资金使用效率低等问题采取具体措施，坚持不懈地抓出成效来。
