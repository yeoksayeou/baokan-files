In 1988, the cotton procurement in Bufeng Township, Yancheng City, Jiangsu Province, once again exceeded 100,000 piculs. For this achievement, the Ministry of Commerce sent a special telegram to offer congratulations.

Ten years earlier, in 1978, Chen Weijia, who had served as the deputy secretary of the Bufeng Township Party Committee, attended the Jiangsu Provincial Rural Work Conference and made a bold statement: "The entire township will work hard, producing 50 million piculs of grain and 100,000 piculs of cotton!" At that time, the cotton production in Bufeng Township had reached 83,000 piculs. It seemed like an athlete attempting to break a new high jump record, just a slight effort might be enough. Unfortunately, year after year, the goal remained unmet. Thus, someone gave Chen Weijia a nickname with a hint of sarcasm: "Chen Ten Thousand."

In 1985, cotton production experienced a dark year. The cotton yield in Bufeng Township reached 84,600 piculs. However, due to grade reduction and price cuts, selling cotton became difficult, frustrating the farmers. A cotton farmer from Xixi Village sold a picul of cotton for only 5 yuan. In anger, he dumped the cotton into the river.

In the spring of 1986, rumors spread from somewhere, saying, "Three years without planting cotton, and there will still be enough cotton," "Cotton is piling up in warehouses, losing 100,000 yuan every second," "Pull out the cotton, love the country!" For a while, people were in a panic.

The officials of the Bufeng Township Party Committee did not know exactly how much cotton was in the national warehouses, but they reasoned: The country is so large, and the population is so numerous. Even if there is an excess this year, it might not be the case next year. After a low tide, there will surely be a high tide. Perhaps the situation will change this year.

"Take responsibility to the people, fear neither demotion nor dismissal!" The township party committee made a resolution to stabilize cotton production: No one is allowed to pull out cotton seedlings or build kilns and ponds in cotton fields; continue to promote new technologies such as high-yield varieties and seedling transplantation to ensure a bumper cotton harvest.

That year, Bufeng Township's grain production exceeded 25 million kilograms, and cotton production reached 86,000 piculs. At this time, the state adjusted its cotton policy, and the money from the previous year's grade reduction and price cuts was returned to the farmers.

It was time to break the 100,000-picul barrier! In 1987, the township party committee proposed the policy of "ensuring grain production and increasing cotton production." They repeatedly studied and implemented measures from resources to funds, from policies to actions. The township party committee secretary, Shen Zhihua, reported a target of 96,000 piculs to higher authorities. Obviously, he learned from the "Chen Ten Thousand" incident and wanted to leave some margin. The district government rewarded a truck, and on the day it was brought back, firecrackers were set off for more than a mile, and layers of people lined the streets to welcome it.

A neighboring township of Bufeng was in chaos in 1986, pulling out cotton seedlings, digging fish ponds, and planting corn. After all the turmoil, by 1988, they had not yet recovered, and the cotton yield remained at the level of five years ago.

Zhang Youren, the deputy township head, was a graduate of an agricultural college in the 1950s and was known as the "cotton expert." In 1982, he went to Youquan Village to work on the ground, promoting new technologies. The farmers said: "Direct sowing is cotton, and transplanting is also cotton, what's the difference?" Ninety percent of the cotton fields still used the old method of direct sowing. Zhang Youren found the poorest farmer in the village, Bai Changlian, and said, "I'll give you the seeds, and you plant the cotton according to my method. I guarantee you a pure income of 300 yuan per mu, will you do it?" Bai Changlian agreed. Old Zhang gave him 1 kilogram of "Yan 48" seeds, one seed per pot, all covered with plastic film. He went to his house twice a week for guidance. By the end of the year, 10 mu of land, cotton plus seeds, sold for 8,000 yuan, and Bai Changlian became rich. The villagers were convinced.

Cotton farming is most afraid of drought and flooding. Water conservation is a major hidden danger in Bufeng. When it rains, the fields are flooded; when it doesn't rain, salt and frost appear.

Chen Hongqi was the township party committee secretary from 1978 to 1981. He raised funds, dredged rivers, and carried out large-scale soil improvement and water conservation projects, creating ridge fields. He encouraged the cadres: "Some things will be criticized in three years, but in three years, people will praise you!"

On July 19, 1987, a torrential rain poured down on Bufeng, with 161.2 millimeters falling in just two hours, submerging 50,000 mu of cotton fields. Wherever ridge fields were created, the water was drained within a day, and the cotton was unaffected. A 1988 statistics showed that villages with ridge fields had a cotton yield increase of over 30% compared to those without.

　　“十万大关”的故事
　　方群
    １９８８年，江苏省盐城市步凤乡棉花收购又超过１０万担。为此，商业部发专电祝贺。
    １０年前的１９７８年，曾任过步凤乡党委副书记的陈维佳参加江苏省农村工作会议，放了一炮：“全乡拚命干，粮食５０００万，棉花１０万担！”此时，步凤乡棉花产量已达８．３万担，如跳高运动员创新，一挺肚皮就可能过去。没成想，一年、二年、三年，横杆一次次落地。于是，有人送陈维佳一个不无讽刺意味的绰号：“陈十万”。
    １９８５年，是棉花生产历史上黑色的一年，步凤乡棉花产量达到８．４６万担。然而，压级、压价，卖棉难，惹恼了农民。西?村一位棉农一担棉只卖５元钱。他一气，将棉花倒进河里。
    １９８６年春，不知从哪里刮来一股风，说“三年不种棉花，棉花都用不完”，“棉花压仓库，嘀嗒一秒钟，损失１０万元！”“拔棉花，爱国家！”一时，人心惶惶。
    步凤乡党委的干部虽然不知道国家仓库里究竟有多少棉花，但他们想：国家这么大，人口这么多，今年多一点，明年不一定多，低潮过后必然有高潮，说不定今年形势就变。
    “向人民负责，不怕丢官，不怕撤职！”乡党委作出稳定棉花生产的决议：不准拔棉苗，不准在棉田建窑、挖塘；继续推广良种和育苗移栽等新技术，千方百计保证棉花丰收。
    这一年，步凤乡粮食突破２５００万公斤，棉花８．６万担。这时，国家对棉花政策作了调整，上年压级、压价的钱又返还给农民。
    该是突破１０万大关的时候了！１９８７年，乡党委提出“保粮增棉”的方针，从物资到资金，从政策到措施，反复研究，反复落实。乡党委书记沈志华给上面报了９．６万担的指标。显然，他吸取“陈十万”的教训，想留有余地。郊区政府奖一辆汽车，开回的那天，鞭炮响一里多路，夹道欢迎的人好几层。
    与步凤毗邻的一个乡，１９８６年乱了套，拔棉苗、挖鱼塘、种高粱，折腾来折腾去，到１９８８年还没喘过气来，棉花产量徘徊在５年前的水平上。
    副乡长张友仁是５０年代农学院毕业生，人称“棉花通”。１９８２年他到友泉村蹲点，推广新技术，农民说：直播是棉花，移栽也是棉花，有啥不一样？９０％的棉田仍用老法子直播。张友仁找到村里最穷的柏长连说：“我给你良种，你按我说的法子种棉花，每亩包你３００元纯收入，干不干？”柏长连乐意。老张给他１公斤“盐棉４８号”种，一粒一钵，全部地膜覆盖。每周去他家辅导两次。年底，１０亩田，棉花加种子，卖８０００元，柏长连一年脱贫致富。乡民信服了。
    种棉，最怕旱涝，水利问题，是步凤一大隐患。雨一下，水汪汪；雨一干，露盐霜。
    陈鸿琪是１９７８年至１９８１年期间的乡党委书记，他筹集资金，整治河道，大规模的改土治水，搞条田，他鼓励干部：“有些事３年之内被人骂，３年之后就会有人夸！”
    １９８７年７月１９日，一场瓢泼大雨倾泻在步凤大地，两小时下１６１．２毫米，５万亩棉田被淹。凡是搞条田化的地方，一天之内水全部排干，棉花未受影响。１９８８年的一份统计表明：搞条田化的村比没搞条田化的村，棉花增产３０％以上。
