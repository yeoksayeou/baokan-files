The second session of the Seventh National People's Congress received over 16,000 letters from various parts of the country during its 16-day meeting. In these letters, the masses offered many constructive suggestions on rectification and deepening reform, and also frankly criticized the work of the People's Congress and the government.

Some residents from Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places criticized the tendency towards grandeur and showiness in China's political life and construction. They hoped that today's reform and opening up would truly adhere to seeking truth from facts. Retired naval officer Cheng Yongfang wrote to the conference, hoping that it would pass an appropriate 1989 national economic and social development plan and state budget, and take effective measures to curb inflation and rectify bad work styles. Some residents urged the quick formulation of a family planning law suitable to China's characteristics, and suggested that the government appoint a vice premier and the party appoint a Politburo Standing Committee member to oversee family planning work.

Many letters called for strengthening the supervisory functions of the National People's Congress and strongly hoped that the resolutions passed at this session would be genuinely implemented.

　　七届全国人大二次会议收到来信一万六千多封
    据新华社北京４月４日电  （记者孙勇）在七届全国人大二次会议召开的１６天时间里，大会信访组共收到全国各地的来信１．６万多封。群众在来信中对治理整顿和深化改革提出了许多积极的建议，也有许多来信对人大和政府的工作坦率地提出了批评意见。
    上海、天津等地的一些群众来信批评了我国政治生活和建设中好大喜功的不良风气。来信希望在今天的改革开放中要真正做到实事求是。海军离休干部程永芳来信希望大会能够通过一个恰当的１９８９年国民经济和社会发展计划及国家预算，在扭转通货膨胀、纠正不好的政风方面有所作为。一些群众要求尽快制定适合我国特点的计划生育法，政府应有一位副总理，党内应有一位政治局常委来抓计划生育工作。
    不少来信要求加强全国人民代表大会的监督职能，并且强烈希望这次大会通过的各项决议能够真正得到贯彻落实。
