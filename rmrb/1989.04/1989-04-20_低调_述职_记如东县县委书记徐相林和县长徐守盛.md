On December 13, 1988, the attention of everyone in the conference room of the Rudong County Guesthouse was focused on a middle-aged man standing at the podium. Half an hour later, the gaze shifted to a tall young man. This was the county Party Secretary, Xuganglin, and the county mayor, Xushoucheng, delivering their performance reports.

Both speakers had taken a winding path to their current positions. In the summer of 1968, Xuganglin, with a rope around his waist and mud up to his knees, led 13 college classmates to work in the rice paddies at the Hongqi Farm in Taizhou. He never imagined that 16 years later, he would be transferred back to Rudong from another province to become the first college graduate to serve as the county mayor, and the following year, the county Party secretary. Xuganglin was filled with a deep sense of duty to serve his country and his hometown. He saw it as his primary responsibility to adjust the industrial structure and transform the traditionally agricultural county into a coastal open county with a coordinated development of industry and agriculture, and an outward-looking economy.

Soon after taking office, he led the county's four leading teams of new and old cadres to Shanghai to attend an economic exchange meeting. In a grand hall filled with guests at the Jinjiang Hotel, he solemnly announced in a powerful voice: "We invite scholars from all quarters to revitalize Rudong's economy, gather information from all sides, and collect funds from home and abroad." He then led various levels of leaders to Suzhou to learn from their experiences, using the development of township enterprises as a breakthrough to revitalize the county's economy. Under the impetus of the reform tide, new ideas, decisive strategies, and solid measures brought good news: the industrial output value of townships (villages) exceeded 200 million yuan in 1984, 300 million yuan in 1985, and 650 million yuan in 1987. For the first time in history, industrial output value surpassed agricultural output value, reaching 900 million yuan the following year. The total foreign trade procurement value exceeded 200 million yuan. What was even more gratifying was that the remarkable development of industry was accompanied by a steady increase in agriculture. Taking grain as an example, the total production was 417,000 tons in 1980 and 643,000 tons in 1988, with an annual growth rate of 5.6%.

If Xuganglin won people's affection with his decisive, straightforward work style, democratic spirit, and humorous personality, then Xushoucheng, who graduated with excellent results from the Anhui Agricultural Economic Management Cadres Academy in 1985 and succeeded Xuganglin as county mayor, won people's admiration with his practical, efficient, and energetic work attitude.

The unforgettable year of 1988. Starting from spring, reports of shortages—fertilizer, pesticides, raw materials, funds, coal, diesel, and electricity—flooded into the county government like a tide. During the most difficult times, administrative staff salaries were delayed, enterprise bonuses were frozen, funds for purchasing agricultural and sideline products were temporarily suspended, and most enterprises stopped production to support agriculture. Add to this the waves of price increases... This situation was unprecedented, not only for the current leaders but also for many retired old secretaries and mayors.

As the "highest administrative official" responsible for the county's economic work, Xushoucheng was not flustered by the severe situation. Instead, he relied closely on the government team, fully utilized the functions of various departments, and insisted on conducting on-site office work in various areas and townships. He stationed himself at financial, tax, power supply, material, and key enterprises to directly command, striving to overcome numerous difficulties. The total industrial and agricultural output value, national income, and national income of the entire county all increased by more than 30% compared to the previous year, fully completing the various economic indicators assigned by the city and county at the beginning of the year.

The division of labor between the mayor and the secretary was clear, but they cooperated seamlessly. The construction of the county's Yangkou Industrial Development Zone can be considered an example. To further adjust the industrial layout and meet the urgent demand for some chemical products in the international market, he and other leaders conducted multiple on-site investigations and careful research. They also invited higher-level departments and relevant experts to repeatedly verify and finally decided to concentrate the chemical industry from various parts of the county to the Yangkou Reclamation Area for development. This way, pollution can be centralized for treatment, and the overall benefits can be better utilized. Now, on the former wasteland, scaffolding stands tall, and the approved projects are being accelerated. Some projects have already started production by the end of last year, achieving the goals of less investment, shorter cycles, and quicker results.

Both the secretary and the mayor felt the weight of their responsibilities, but they both viewed their positions lightly. Xuganglin said very plainly: "Twenty years ago, I never imagined that I would be an official today. Since I have this position today, I must prioritize action and not just be a decoration for others to see." Xushoucheng put it more directly: "Being the county mayor is a role that the times have pushed me into. If I can do a good job in this term, I will; if I can't, I will go back to fishing."

Don't think this is just for show. In the summer of 1986, Xushoucheng personally led a team to investigate the eastern part of the county, Dongsha in Huzhou. He was as excited as a child, enthusiastically joining the fishermen in driving stakes, spreading clam seeds, and catching frogs.

Xuganglin is a farmer's son, and Xushoucheng is a fisherman's descendant. Their roots are deeply embedded in this warm soil of their hometown, among the people. They are "officials," but they are also part of the people.

Back to the performance report meeting: To the surprise of the attendees, Xuganglin and Xushoucheng spoke very little about the achievements that should belong to them and did not exaggerate them. Instead, while emphasizing collective leadership, the roles of other comrades, and the broad masses, they played the role of the double bass in an orchestra, playing a "low-key" tune for themselves.

The mayor said: "There are many things I have not done well. Some I have neglected, some I have thought of but not done, and some I have done but not well..."

The secretary said: "Some of my work has not been done well enough. I was originally a departmental business cadre, and the time I have been in charge of the county Party's overall work is not long, and my experience is insufficient... In the future, I will continue to exert my full effort, fulfill my duties, and work diligently..."

The "low-key" performance report was filled with self-deprecation, self-blame, calm reflection, and a practical spirit. The city Party leaders and the county's department-level and above main responsible comrades present gave them high scores for their "low-key" performance reports.

　　“低调”述职    
    ——记如东县县委书记徐相林和县长徐守盛
    陈咏华
    １９８８年１２月１３日，江苏省如东县招待所会议室内，全场目光投向讲台前一位稳健的中年人，半个多小时后，视线又集中到一位高个子青年——这是该县县委书记徐相林和县长徐守盛正在作述职报告。
    两个述职者都走过一条曲折的路。１９６８年初夏，泰州红旗农场当徐相林腰捆草绳，满腿污泥，带领１３名高校同学在秧田劳作时，他没有料到１６年后，会从外地调回如东，成为故乡历史上第一任大学生出任的县长，翌年又成了县委书记。徐相林满怀报效祖国、报恩家乡父老的赤子之情，他把调整产业结构，促使传统的农业县向工农业协调发展、以外向型经济为导向的沿海开放县的转变，作为自己的首要职责。上任不久，即率县四套班子新老干部去上海参加经济联谊会，在锦江饭店一间宾朋满座的大厅里，他以洪亮的嗓门庄重宣布：要为振兴如东经济恭请四方名士，博采各路信息，广集海内外资金。接着，又数次带领各级领导去苏南取经，把发展乡镇企业作为振兴全县经济的突破口。在改革大潮的推动下，崭新的思路，果断的战略，扎实的措施，迎来了捷报频传：乡镇（村）工业产值１９８４年突破２亿元，１９８５年突破３亿元，１９８７年创６．５亿，历史上工业产值第一次超过农业产值，去年又达到９亿。外贸收购总额去年突破２亿大关。令人可喜的是，工业令人瞩目的发展是与农业的稳步增长相配套的。以粮食为例，１９８０年总产４１．７万吨，１９８８年达到６４．３万吨，年递增率为５．６％。
    如果说，徐相林以他果断、明快的工作作风、民主精神和幽默性格赢得了人们的喜爱，那么，１９８５年以优异成绩从安徽农业经济管理干部学院毕业，接替相林担任县长的徐守盛，则以其实干、效率、朝气勃勃、雷厉风行的工作姿态获得人们的赞赏。作为县委副书记，他不仅紧密配合书记和其他常委，认真研究全县经济建设、社会发展的大政方针，而在将这些大政方针具体组织实施方面，投入了全副精力。
    难忘的１９８８年。从春天开始，缺化肥、缺农药、缺原材料、缺资金、缺煤炭、缺柴油、缺电……一份份告急报告，一次次求援电话潮水般涌向县政府。最困难时期，行政人员工资缓发，企业职工奖金冻结，收购农副产品的资金暂付，绝大部分企业停电支农，再加上阵阵涨价风的袭击……这种状况不仅现任领导从未见过，许多离任的老书记、老县长也说是前所未见。徐守盛作为负责全县经济工作的“最高行政长官”，没有被严峻的形势搅乱心绪，而是紧紧依靠政府一班人，充分发挥部门职能作用，同时坚持深入各片、乡现场办公，坐镇金融、财税、供电、物资、重点企业直接指挥，努力克服重重困难。全县工农业总产值、国民生产总值和国民收入都比上年增长３０％以上，全面完成了年初市、县下达的各项经济指标。
    县长、书记分工各有侧重，但配合默契，兴建该县洋口工业开发区可算是一个范例。为了进一步调整工业布局，同时满足国际市场上对一些化工产品的迫切需要，他俩和其他领导一道，经过多次实地调查、慎重研究，并请上级部门和有关专家反复论证，拍板决定把全县各地一些化工行业都集中到洋口垦区开发，这样既能集中处理污染，又能更好地发挥整体效益。如今，在原来的荒滩地上，脚手架林立，被批准的项目正在加速建设。其中有的项目已于去年底投产，达到了投资少、周期短、见效快的目的。
    书记、县长均感肩上担子重，但对“官”又都看得很轻。徐相林说得非常朴实：“２０年前从未想到今天作官，既然有了今天，就要干字当头，不作摆饰让人看。”徐守盛说得更为直接：“当县长是时代把我推上来的，这一届能当好就当，当不好我还会下海捕鱼。”
    别以为这是在作文章。１９８６年初夏，徐守盛亲自带队去县境东北方向的东沙海滁考察。他像孩子般欢欣雀跃，兴致勃勃地和渔民一同打桩、撒蛤苗、钩蛙。
    徐相林是农民的儿子，徐守盛则是渔民的后代。他们的根扎在家乡这片热土上，扎在群众之中。他们是“官”，也是民。
    还是回到述职报告会上：出乎与会者的意外，徐相林、徐守盛对应该属于他们的那一份政绩谈得很少，更没有大肆渲染。相反，在多次强调集体领导、其他同仁和广大群众作用的同时，像是乐队的大提琴，他们对自己奏着“低调”。
    县长说：“我不少工作没有抓好，有的是疏忽了，没有想到，有的是想到了没有做到，有的是做了但没有做好……”
    书记说：“我有些工作抓得还不够，本人原系部门业务干部，主持县委全面工作的时间还不算长，经验不足……今后我当继续竭尽全力，恪尽职守，兢兢业业……”。
    “低调”的述职报告里，充满了自谦自责、冷静思索与务实精神。与会的市委领导、全县局级以上主要负责同志，面对他们的“低调”述职却打了令人信服的高分。
