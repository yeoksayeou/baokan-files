Brazil Implements Economic Adjustments Again

Foreign Trade Surplus Hits New Record

		BEIJING, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government today announced a new economic adjustment plan, modifying price and wage policies for the coming period and deciding to reinstate indexation measures. This is the second adjustment since the implementation of the "Summer Plan" in mid-January, which aimed primarily at curbing inflation.

		In terms of price control, the new plan stipulates that prices frozen since January can now be adjusted every three months based on changes in production costs. The adjustment amount must not exceed the inflation rate for the same period and must be approved by the Ministry of Finance. No department is allowed to raise prices unilaterally.

		Regarding wages, the government has decided to use subsidies to compensate workers for losses incurred due to price increases. The subsidy amounts are capped between 11.74% and 18.69% depending on different wage levels.

		According to the Brazilian Bank of Foreign Trade, Brazil's foreign trade surplus for the first quarter of this year has set a new record. The surplus for the first two months reached $2.7 billion, and for March, it was $1.6 billion, totaling $4.3 billion. This represents a 32% increase compared to the same period last year.

　　巴西再次实行经济调整   
    外贸顺差创新纪录
    本报巴西利亚４月１９日电  记者兰才基报道：巴西政府今天公布了一项新的经济调整计划，对今后一个时期的物价与工资政策作了修改，并决定重新实行指数化措施，这是自今年１月中旬以来推行以压制通货膨胀为主要目标的“夏令计划”的再调整。
    在控制物价方面，新计划规定，自１月份以来宣布冻结的物价，今后可根据生产成本的变化每３个月作一次调整，调价幅度不得超过同一时期内的通货膨胀指数，调价之前必须经过财政部核准，任何部门不得擅自提价。
    职工工资，政府决定用补贴的办法弥补职工由物价上涨带来的损失，补贴的数额按不同工资等级限制在１１．７４％至１８．６９％以内。
    另据巴西银行外贸局今天宣布，巴西今年第一季度外贸顺差创下新纪录，头两个月达到２７亿美元，３月份达１６亿美元，累计为４３亿美元，比去年同期增长３２％。
