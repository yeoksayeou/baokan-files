After the World Table Tennis Championships team event concluded, the Chinese table tennis delegation conducted a thorough review. On the 6th, our reporter specifically interviewed Vice-Deputy Li Furen to discuss his views on the China-Sweden men's team final.

Li Furen said, "From the score perspective, we didn't play well. From the tactics and strategies, we have significant shortcomings, revealing our gaps. Firstly, our backhand attacks and defenses are relatively weak. Secondly, our mid-to-long-distance techniques are not as good as the European players. Additionally, our serves are monotonous; we dare not serve long balls, fearing the opponent will rush to smash. The Swedish players, however, serve long and short balls with ease, using them flexibly. In receiving serves, we are also very passive, often caught off guard by the opponent's attacks."

Li Furen continued, "From another perspective, our men's team has won the team championship for the past four World Table Tennis Championships, but this time we lost the championship. This shows that the world of table tennis is developing rapidly, and the European teams are improving faster than us. This is also a push and motivation for us, prompting us to think about how to further improve Chinese table tennis. I believe we need to cultivate new talent and develop new tactics and techniques. Without these two aspects, catching up will be very difficult."

Following this, Li Furen analyzed the China-Sweden final from the perspective of lineup and player selection. He said, "The gap between the two teams should not be 5:0. In the past two championships, we defeated them 5:0, mainly because of their lineup issues and key players being sick. This time, they defeated us 5:0, which was also unexpected. I originally estimated the victory margin to be at least 5:2, 5:3, or even 5:4. Our lineup was a relatively ideal plan. The first two rounds were favorable for us. Jiang Jialiang against Appelgren, Waldner, Chen Longcan against Persson, Appelgren, these matches, based on past individual records, we had a slight advantage. Only Teng Yi against Waldner was at a disadvantage. Therefore, in the first two rounds, we thought we could at least win 4:2. From the competition situation, if we had won one of the first three matches, the situation would have been much better."

Li Furen expressed that the current priority is to boost morale and play well in the five individual events. Xu Yan Sheng specially motivated the entire team yesterday, hoping everyone would learn from Liang Ge Liang's spirit of fighting back after losing three points in the team event and winning the championship in the individual events.

### 中国男队失利原因何在

　　中国男队失利原因何在
    世乒赛团体赛结束后，中国乒乓球代表团及时作了认真总结。本报记者６日专门采访了李富荣副团长，请他再对中国瑞典男子团体决赛谈些看法。
    李富荣说：“这场比赛从比分上看我们打得不太好，从打法和技战术上分析，我们也有比较大的缺陷，看出了我们的差距。首先是反手的进攻和防御都比较弱，其次中远台技术不如欧洲选手。另外，发球显得单调，不敢发长球，怕对方抢拉。瑞典选手发球长短左右都敢发，运用自如。在接发球上我们也显得很被动，常被对方抢攻。”
    李富荣又说：“从另一角度讲，我们男队前四届世乒赛连续拿了团体冠军，这次丢掉了冠军，说明世界乒乓球运动正在迅速发展，欧洲队伍提高比我们快。这对我们也是一种推动和促进，促使我们好好想一想中国的乒乓球运动怎样进一步提高。我认为一个是要培养新人，另一个是要有新的打法和技术。没有这两条，迎头赶上就很困难。”
    接着，李富荣从排阵、出场人选方面具体分析了中瑞这场决赛。他说：“两队之间的差距不应是５∶０的差距，上两届我们打他们５∶０，主要是对方排阵和主力生病等原因。这一次他们打我们５∶０，也是出乎预料的，我原来估计胜负至少应在５∶２、５∶３、甚至５∶４。我们的排阵是比较理想的方案，前两轮次对我们有利，江嘉良对阿佩伊伦、瓦尔德内尔，陈龙灿对佩尔森、阿佩伊伦，这几场从以往个人战绩看，我们略占上风。只有滕毅对瓦尔德内尔一场处于下风。所以前两轮的六盘球原想怎么也能打成４∶２。从比赛情况看，前三盘我们只要拿下一盘局势也会好得多。”
    李富荣表示，眼下首要的是鼓舞士气，打好五个单项的比赛。徐寅生昨天特别对全体队员作了动员，希望大家学习当年梁戈亮团体赛丢三分后单项比赛奋力夺冠军的顽强精神。
