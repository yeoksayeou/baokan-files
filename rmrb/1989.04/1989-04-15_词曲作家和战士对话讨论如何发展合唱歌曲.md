In recent years, while lyrical songs have been receiving waves of applause, military choral songs have shown a tendency to decline. Facing this situation in the music scene, several songwriters were invited by the editorial department of "Liberation Army Songs" and the "People's Engineer" magazine in early April to visit a certain unit of the Engineering Corps. They engaged in a dialogue with the soldiers.

During the discussion, many soldiers believed that choral songs are still an important form of military entertainment activities. Moreover, military assemblies and gatherings need rhythmic and majestic songs to boost morale. However, there are currently two problems with choral songs: first, most of the "universal" choral songs in use are old songs that have been in service for too long, such as "Returning from Target Practice" and "I Am a Soldier"; second, there is a shortage of cultural talents at the grassroots level in the military. Songs published in newspapers are difficult to sing, and the lack of interest from television and radio in choral songs means that many choral songs that could have been popularized are gathering dust.

Songwriters Shi Xiang, Sheng Mao, Chen Kezheng, Liu Hong, Wu Chongsheng, Shi Xin, and Tian Guang participated in this activity.

　　词曲作家和战士对话讨论如何发展合唱歌曲
    近几年，在抒情歌曲博得阵阵喝采声中，军队的合唱歌曲却有萎缩的趋势。面对歌坛的这种局面，一些词曲作家于４月初应《解放军歌曲》编辑部和《人民工兵》杂志社的邀请，专程到工程兵某部，和战士们对话。在座谈中，许多战士认为，合唱歌曲仍是军队文娱活动的重要形式，而且军队集合、集会也需要有节奏感强、威武雄壮的歌曲振奋精神。但目前合唱歌曲存在两个问题，一是目前“通用”的合唱歌曲，大多是超期复役的老“战士”，如《打靶归来》、《我是一个兵》；二是军队基层文艺骨干奇缺，报刊上登的歌曲，有口难“言”，加之电视、广播等视听工具对合唱歌曲兴趣不浓，使一些本可以传唱开来的合唱歌曲束之高阁。
    石祥、生茂、陈克正、刘虹、吴崇生、士心、田光等知名词曲作家参加了这一活动。
