Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 8th.

According to the Democratic Kampuchea Radio, Democratic Kampuchea Chairman Prince Norodom Sihanouk issued a statement on April 6th stating: "Vietnam must withdraw all its troops from Cambodia unconditionally within the shortest possible time."

On April 5th, Vietnam announced that it would withdraw all its troops from Cambodia by the end of this September. Vietnam also stated that the international supervisory body for the withdrawal and other matters would be composed of representatives from India, Poland, Canada, Indonesia, and a personal representative of the United Nations Secretary-General. The international community believes that effective international supervision should be established under the auspices of the United Nations Secretary-General after consultations with relevant countries.

Prince Sihanouk emphasized: "Vietnam's withdrawal should be supervised and verified by the United Nations International Supervisory Commission. The composition of the supervisory commission should be decided after consultations between the United Nations Security Council, the United Nations Secretary-General, and the governments of member countries willing to participate in the commission."

He pointed out: "After Vietnam's complete withdrawal from Cambodia, foreign aid to the four Cambodian factions should cease."

Prince Sihanouk advocates for the United Nations to dispatch an international peacekeeping force to Cambodia to ensure peace and prevent any single faction from seizing power.

Prince Sihanouk said that after Vietnam's withdrawal, "the illegal 'People's Republic of Kampuchea' and the legitimate government of Democratic Kampuchea—the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea—should both dissolve to facilitate the establishment of a temporary national unity government of the four Cambodian factions."

Prince Sihanouk said: "Democratic Kampuchea is a sovereign state and a member of the United Nations. It does not recognize any decisions or agreements made by Vietnam, Laos, and the Phnom Penh regime."

　　西哈努克亲王发表声明
    越南必须尽快无条件从柬撤军
    新华社北京４月８日电  据民主柬埔寨电台今天广播，民主柬埔寨主席诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王４月６日发表声明指出：“越南必须在最短的时间内无条件地从柬埔寨撤出全部军队。”
    ４月５日，越南宣布在今年９月底之前从柬埔寨全部撤军。越南同时还说，对撤军等进行国际监督的机构将由印度、波兰、加拿大、印尼和联合国秘书长的私人代表等组成。国际社会认为，有效的国际监督应由联合国秘书长经同有关国家协商后，主持建立。
    西哈努克强调指出：“越南的撤军应该接受联合国国际监督委员会的监督和核实。监督委员会的成员组成应该由联合国安理会、联合国秘书长与愿意参加该委员会的成员国的政府协商之后作出决定”。
    他指出：“越南全部从柬埔寨撤军后，外国对柬埔寨四方军队的援助应该停止。”
    西哈努克主张由联合国派遣国际维持和平部队进驻柬埔寨，以确保柬埔寨的和平，防止任何一派独家掌权。
    西哈努克说，越南撤军后，“非法的‘柬埔寨人民共和国’和合法的民主柬埔寨政权——民柬联合政府应同时解散，以便筹建柬埔寨四方临时民族团结政府。”
    西哈努克说：“民主柬埔寨是一个主权国家，是联合国的成员国。它不承认越南、老挝和金边政权作出的一切决定和达成的一切协议。”
