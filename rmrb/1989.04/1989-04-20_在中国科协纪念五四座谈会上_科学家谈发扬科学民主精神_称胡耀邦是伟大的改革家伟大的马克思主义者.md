More than a hundred prominent natural and social scientists in the capital gathered today to discuss how to inherit and carry forward the spirit of science and democracy that arose during the May Fourth Movement in the context of modernizing construction today.

The vice president of the China Association for Science and Technology, Qian Sanqiang, presided over the symposium commemorating the 70th anniversary of May Fourth. He first proposed that everyone stand to observe a moment of silence for the late Hu Yaobang, a great reformer. The attendees paid tribute to Hu Yaobang's democratic and scientific spirit, praising him as a great Marxist.

Gong Yuzhi, a member of the China Association for Science and Technology and vice minister of the Propaganda Department, delivered a speech titled "Mourning Comrade Yaobang and Carrying Forward the May Fourth Spirit." He pointed out that as a great Marxist, Hu Yaobang not only attached great importance to the cause of science but also placed great emphasis on the spirit of science. After the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee, Hu Yaobang, who participated in the leadership of the discussion on the criteria for truth, applied the spirit of science and opposition to blind adherence to Marxists themselves. The discussion on the criteria for truth restored the original face of Marxism, and Hu Yaobang's great contribution in this regard is indelible.

Wu Mingyu, deputy director of the State Council's Economic, Technological, and Social Development Research Center, said that Deng Xiaoping and Hu Yaobang are undoubtedly the outstanding representatives and great leaders of the contemporary new enlightenment and thought liberation movement. He said, "Hu Yaobang is a Communist with a modern consciousness. He can appreciate all the excellent cultures of the world. He has always adhered to the 'Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools of Thought' policy, is approachable, and never acts like a leader."

The current and future promotion of the democratic and scientific spirit advocated by the May Fourth Movement is also a central topic.

Hu Qiheng, vice president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, believes that a democratic atmosphere and an environment where people can freely express their opinions are necessary guarantees for promoting the spirit of science. To pursue objective truth, an environment where people can speak without fear of punishment is absolutely necessary.

Zhu Lilan, vice minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, believes that the scientific spirit that everyone must have should have different focuses. For decision-makers, the first thing is to have correct concepts and make correct strategic policies and procedures. Following one's feelings will achieve nothing, but following science will lead to success.

Famous scientist Zhang Guodou also pointed out that democracy means that the people can all be masters of their own affairs. In the past, it was often said that subordinates must obey superiors, but it should be added that superiors must concentrate on the correct opinions of subordinates and can be mutually constrained with subordinates. It should not be that a few people make all the decisions; there should be a good democratic system.

Those who spoke at the meeting today also included Qian Xuesen, Li Chang, Gao Zhenning, Yu Zhiyuan, Qiu Weifan, Wen Jize, Yu Weidong, Shen Yuan, Zhao Zhongxian, and others.

　　在中国科协纪念五四座谈会上    
    科学家谈发扬科学民主精神    
    称胡耀邦是伟大的改革家伟大的马克思主义者
    本报北京４月２０日讯  记者孔晓宁报道，首都百余著名的自然科学家和社会科学家今天聚会，畅谈在当今的现代化建设中，怎样继承并发扬五四运动兴起的科学与民主精神。
    中国科协副主席钱三强主持了纪念五四７０周年座谈会。他首先提议全体起立，为伟大的改革家胡耀邦同志的逝世默哀。与会人士纷纷缅怀胡耀邦的民主科学精神，称颂他为一位伟大的马克思主义者。
    中国科协常委、中宣部副部长龚育之作了题为“悼念耀邦同志，发扬五四精神”的发言。他指出，胡耀邦作为一个伟大的马克思主义者，不仅对科学事业十分重视，对于科学精神更为重视。十一届三中全会以后，由胡耀邦参与领导的关于真理标准的讨论，把科学精神和反对盲从迷信用于对待马克思主义者本身。真理标准讨论恢复了马克思主义本来面目，胡耀邦在这方面所做的重大贡献是不可磨灭的。
    国务院经济技术社会发展研究中心副总干事长吴明瑜指出，邓小平与胡耀邦无疑是当代新启蒙运动和思想解放运动的杰出代表与伟大旗手。他说：“胡耀邦是具有现代意识的共产党人。他能珍视世界一切优秀文化。他始终贯彻‘双百’方针，平易近人，从不以领导者自居。”
    当前与今后如何将五四运动倡导的民主科学精神真正发扬光大，也是中心话题之一。
    中国科学院副院长胡启恒认为，民主的气氛，自由发表意见的环境，是发扬科学精神必需要有的保障。为了追求客观真理，绝对需要一种言者无罪的民主环境。
    国家科委副主任朱丽兰则认为，对于各种人，其必须具有的科学精神应当各有重点。对于决策者来说，首先应当做到观念正确，制定战略政策及其程序的正确。跟着感觉走，一事无成，跟着科学走，才能成功。
    著名科学家张光斗也指出，民主就是人民群众都能当家作主。过去常说下级需服从上级，应当补充一条：上级必须集中下级的正确意见，并与下级可以互相制约。不能少数人说了算，要有很好的民主体制。
    在今天会上发言的还有钱学森、李昌、高镇宁、于志远、裘维蕃、温济泽、于维栋、沈元、赵忠贤等。
