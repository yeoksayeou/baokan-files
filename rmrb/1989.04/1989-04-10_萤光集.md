I am not a star, not a gemstone,
I am a firefly; a beacon of hope for the night traveler.
Dim light nurtures starlight,
Loneliness gives birth to songs.
In the vast waves of the soul,
Even stones can be transformed into magical sculptures.
The heavens and earth are like a broad chest,
Blood boiling like red clouds.
The flower of freedom
Is also a flower of blood and tears.
The "truth" that makes one shudder
What difference is there between it and a flood or a wild beast?
On the journey of life,
Every step forward is accompanied by a dream.
When you are on the verge of a magnificent peak,
You are also on the verge of a bottomless abyss.
There is waterfall cascading into a silver arc,
There are ordinary people becoming diamonds.
Life's misfortune is not due to scarcity,
But because of excessive vanity.
Frost brings silver hair and also golden autumn.
Misfortune brings pain and also sublimation.
A mischievous child is the result of overindulgence,
An arrogant master is the result of servile flattery.

　　萤光集
　　鲁藜
    我不是星，不是宝石
    是萤火虫；夜行人一点希望
    暗淡孕育星光
    寂寞催生歌曲
    在壮阔灵魂的波涛里
    石头也能化为神奇的雕刻
    天地如同宽阔的胸膛
    热血沸腾如同绯霞
    自由之花
    也是血泪之花
    让人战慄的“真理”
    和洪水猛兽有什么区别
    在人生的征途上
    每一个行进的足印都伴着一个梦
    当你濒临于显赫峰巅
    也正濒临于万仞深渊
    有落差流水化为银虹
    有坎坷凡夫变为金刚
    人生有种灾祸不是因为匮乏
    而是因为过多的虚荣
    严霜带来银发也带来金秋
    不幸带来痛苦也带来升华
    顽劣孩子是溺爱惯的
    专横老爷是一些奴性巴结成的
