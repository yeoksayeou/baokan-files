Title: Let "God" Be Informed

The observance of "International Consumer Rights Day" has sparked many thoughts, which can be summed up in one sentence: Let "God" be informed.

The phrase "the customer is God" has been in use for many years. It has two meanings: first, it shows respect for consumers, acknowledging that "the customer is always right"; second, it recognizes that consumers are the "masters," as they hold the money and decide whether to buy, what to buy, and thus influence the direction, performance, and even fate of enterprises.

However, the status of this "God" in China is quite nominal. Although the slogan has been repeatedly promoted, there has been little actual improvement. The main reason is likely that China is still in a state of "shortage economy," where most goods are in a seller's market. There is no worry about not selling, only about not being able to buy. How can consumers act like "God"? Sometimes, the sellers become the "God"!

So, under these circumstances, can the status of Chinese consumers, this "God," be improved at all? Not entirely pessimistic. First, not all goods are in short supply, for example, clothing, where consumers' "trends" play a significant role. Second, even for scarce goods, consumers still have some choice. No matter how scarce refrigerators are, if the quality is poor and the service is bad, I won't hastily spend money. Third, consumers can use various means to supervise operators. With these three points, consumers still have some "countermeasures."

However, Chinese consumers themselves also have weaknesses: they are relatively scattered and lack information; they lack modern product knowledge and find it difficult to quickly make up for it; they are accustomed to a product economy environment and face market changes under commodity economy conditions with a fragile psychological quality, easily "rushing" to buy. Unscrupulous operators precisely exploit this "rush." Additionally, Chinese consumers are also constrained by narrow consumption scope, irrational consumption structure, and wave-like competitive consumption.

To truly establish the "God" status of Chinese consumers, it is necessary to change the shortage economy situation and do work in many aspects. Currently, what can be done immediately and see immediate effects is to let "God" be informed: inform consumers of market conditions and product information; popularize product knowledge; publicize quality inspection results; consumers should be able to communicate with regulatory authorities and with each other. For example, next to the counter selling household appliances, various brands of refrigerators' quality data, evaluation results, and purchasing knowledge can be posted; at the clothing counter, fabric knowledge and style knowledge handbooks can be sold; in newspapers and magazines, product knowledge can be widely promoted, and the circulation of such magazines can be expanded, etc.

Now, macro-control departments often worry about their control measures not being effective. Why not mobilize and arm this "God" who is everywhere—the broad masses of consumers—to jointly manage the market? This can have immediate effects.

### 让“上帝”知情

　　让“上帝”知情
　　文牛
    过“国际消费者权益日”，引发许多想法，集中到一句话，叫做让“上帝”知情。
    “顾客是上帝”，这话已引进多年。意思有两层：一是对消费者的尊重，“顾客总是对的”；一是承认消费者是“主宰”，钱握他手，买不买，买什么，决定着企业的方向、效益乃至命运。
    可是这位“上帝”在中国的地位相当名不副实，那句口号虽屡经宣传，也没有多少实际改善。主要原因恐怕还是我国处于“短缺经济”状况，多数商品是卖方市场。不愁卖不出，只愁买不到，消费者怎摆“上帝”的架势？有时卖方倒成了“上帝”！
    那么，在这种情况下，中国消费者这位“上帝”的地位就不能有丝毫改善了吗？也不可完全悲观。一者，并非所有商品都供不应求，例如服装，消费者的“潮流”就起很大作用。二者，即使紧俏商品，消费者仍保有一定选择权利。电冰箱再缺，你质量不好，服务不好，我也不贸然掏钱。三者，消费者可以用种种方式监督经营者。有这三条，消费者也还有“还手之力”。
    但是，中国消费者本身也确有弱点：他们比较分散，且信息不灵；他们缺乏现代商品知识，又难以马上弥补；他们习惯于产品经济的环境，面对商品经济条件下的市场变化，呈现出一种脆弱的心理素质，动不动就“抢”。不正当经营者恰恰利用了这个“抢”。再加上中国消费者还受到消费面窄、消费结构不合理、浪潮式攀比消费等等的制约。
    要真正确立中国消费者的“上帝”地位，需要改变短缺经济的状况，需要做多方面的工作。而目前，马上能够做到、马上能够见效的，就是让“上帝”知情：要把市场情况、商品情况告诉消费者；要向他们普及商品知识；要把质量检验结果公之于众；消费者要能够和主管机关通气、彼此通气。比如说，在卖家用电器的柜台旁边，就可贴出各种牌子冰箱的质量数据、评比结果以及选购知识；在服装柜台，就可以出售面料知识、款式知识手册；在报刊上可以广为宣传商品知识，推广这类杂志的发行等等。
    现在，宏观调控部门常常为自己的调控手段不灵而发愁，那么为什么不把这位无处不在的“上帝”——广大消费者动员起来、武装起来，一起来管理这个市场呢？这是可以立竿见影的。
