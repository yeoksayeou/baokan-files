The United Nations Transitional Assistance Group (UNTAG) has completed its deployment in Namibia.

The head of the United Nations Special Representative Office in Namibia said on April 28 in Windhoek that the United Nations Security Council decided to send 4,650 military personnel to Namibia during the transitional period to supervise the independence process. By April 28, 4,453 military personnel from 21 United Nations member countries had arrived in Namibia and completed their deployment.

He said that the United Nations police force to be sent to Namibia should be 500 strong, but by April 28, only 297 had arrived, with another 71 expected to arrive on April 29.

Additionally, 28 armed fighters of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) captured by the South African military were sent to Angola by the UNTAG on April 27, while 3 injured fighters are still receiving treatment from the UNTAG.

The joint committee of Angola, Cuba, and South Africa concluded a two-day meeting in Cape Town today, reaching an agreement on the inspection team for the withdrawal of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) from Namibia to Angola within 14 days.

Representatives from the United States and the Soviet Union attended the meeting as observers.

A joint statement released after the meeting said that the inspection procedure will begin at 6 AM on April 29, after the 60-hour period during which South Africa announced the restriction of its troops in Namibia to their camps has elapsed.

The statement said that after the inspection is completed, the South African military will return to and be restricted within their barracks. The United Nations Security Council's Resolution 435 on Namibian independence will continue to be implemented as originally planned. It is reported that more than 1,300 SWAPO guerrillas have already returned to Angola from Namibia. According to the United Nations, there are still over 200 guerrillas remaining in Namibia.
