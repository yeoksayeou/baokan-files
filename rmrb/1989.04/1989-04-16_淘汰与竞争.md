		Elimination and Competition
		Lù Shìhuá

		Reforming the personnel system and establishing a competitive mechanism for cadres has been discussed for a long time, but many people still do not know how to proceed. Therefore, in some places, it is still the case that "berleks choose horses," and one does not need to go to the racetrack to be considered a "good horse"; it is still a "lifetime tenure system," where one does not need to handle retirement procedures or make mistakes to be removed from office.

		In fact, competition in personnel and cadre affairs is the same as other competitions, following the rule of "survival of the fittest." To establish a competitive mechanism, one must first establish an elimination system. Without an elimination system, it is difficult to eliminate inferior products, let alone people. Therefore, mediocre individuals are not particularly afraid of "evaluations," "assessments," and "term changes"; at most, they will be transferred to another place to continue being an official. Lazy workers are also not afraid of enterprise bankruptcy, as they will be "properly arranged." Even more frightening is that there are no rules for elimination, and "optimizing combinations" has become an excuse for "nepotism." Consequently, "family combinations," "relationship combinations," and "buddy combinations" appear, and honest people and talented individuals are "eliminated." In such a situation, reformers with great ambitions can only be helpless against the incompetent.

		Without real elimination, competition is empty. Why do some units have more and more bonuses but lower and lower efficiency? Why do some places do a lot of work in evaluating and assessing cadres, but the quality of cadres does not improve? The reason is that there is no real elimination.

		A perfect elimination system requires a perfect legal system. The rights and obligations of workers, the powers and responsibilities of factory directors, etc., must be guaranteed and constrained by law, so that those who should be eliminated cannot stay, and those who should stay cannot be eliminated. To achieve this goal, reform must continue to develop. However, as a first step, I believe that every cadre and worker should have a clear "target responsibility system." This "target responsibility system" should at least be certified with legal effect. If workers are lazy and do not meet the targets, they can be fired, and they cannot blame the factory director; if the factory director and other leaders do not meet the targets, they cannot keep their "official hats" just by admitting mistakes; they must step down under legal supervision; if they want to be officials again, they can only improve their qualifications and compete again. If the performance evaluation of cadres and the assessment of workers are only for the purpose of "promoting achievements and correcting mistakes," "happily distributing bonuses," without elimination and promotion, how can the whole society establish a competitive consciousness?

　　淘汰与竞争
　　陆士华
    改革人事制度，建立干部竞争机制，已经讲了好久了，然而，不少人至今仍不知从何下手。因此，在一些地方，依然是靠“伯乐相马”，不上赛马场，也能当“良驹”；仍然是“职务终身制”，不办离退休手续、不犯错误下不来。
    其实，人事、干部上的竞争和别的竞争一样，规律是“优胜劣汰”。建立竞争机制，先要建立淘汰制度。没有淘汰制度，劣质产品尚且难汰掉，何况人呢？因此，现在的平庸之辈并不怎么怕“评议”、“考核”和“换届”，大不了换个地方照样当官；懒散的职工也并不怕企业破产，反正会得到“妥善安置”的。更可怕的是，淘汰无章可循，“优化组合”反倒成了“任人唯亲”的借口。因而出现了“亲化组合”、“关系组合”、“哥们儿组合”等，把老实人、贤才良将“汰”掉了。在这种状况下，有鸿鹄之志的改革者对无能之辈也只能无可奈何。
    淘汰不实，竞争就虚。为什么有些单位奖金越发越多，效率却越来越低？为什么有些地方评议干部、考核干部的工作做得有声有色，但干部素质却不见提高？原因就在于没有实行淘汰。
    完善的淘汰制度，需要完善的法制。职工的权利和义务，厂长的权力和责任等等，都要受法律的保障和制约，才能使该汰的留不了，该留的汰不掉。达到这个目标，尚需改革的继续发展。但是，作为第一步，我以为任何干部和职工都应有明确的“目标责任制”。这种“目标责任制”至少应得到有法律效力的公证。职工懒懒散散，达不到目标被解雇，怨不了厂长；厂长以及别的领导达不到目标，用“承认失误”也保不住“乌纱”，他必须在法律监督下下台；再想当官，只能提高素质，重新竞争。如果干部的考绩、职工的考核，目的仅仅是“发扬成绩，纠正错误”，“高高兴兴发奖金”，没有淘汰与晋升，怎么让全社会建立竞争意识呢？
