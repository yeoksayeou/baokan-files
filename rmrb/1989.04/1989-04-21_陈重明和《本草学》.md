    Chen Chongming and "Materia Medica Studies"
    By People's Daily reporter Zhu Weiqun

    When talking about materia medica, people immediately think of Li Shizhen's "Compendium of Materia Medica." In fact, since the first century AD, China has produced over 300 materia medica works, forming the world's most complete and still highly practical pharmacology system. Studying the history of materia medica, analyzing and comparing the listed herbs to correct their names and rectify errors, and exploring their potential uses in botany and medicine, is a new and emerging field. In 1972, Taiwan first published a printed and photocopied version of "Materia Medica Studies." In 1984, Hong Kong published "Introduction to Materia Medica Research." Recently, a 400,000-word mainland version of "Materia Medica Studies" has finally been published.

    Author Chen Chongming studied fruit trees in college and graduated in 1960 to work at the Jiangsu Institute of Botany, assisting the materia medica expert Huang Shengbai. At the age of 70, Huang would take him up the mountains every week to identify herbs one by one. At that time, some domestic scholars believed that materia medica was not scientific and did not pay much attention to it. Researching this field required patience and endurance. Chen decided to sit on the "cold bench" for 20 to 30 years to fill the gap in China's botany and medicine.

    During the Cultural Revolution, researchers were all sent to the countryside for "struggle, criticism, and transformation," and scientific and technological archives were in disarray. Some people even suggested burning those old and yellow ancient books. Chen Chongming came up with a trick, asking someone to store these materials in the only "forbidden zone" of the institute—the personnel archives room, thus saving materia medica research from a potential disaster.

    In 1977, a meeting on the editing of botanical gardens was held in Lushan. Chen Chongming, who was of little importance, managed to secure 15 minutes of speaking time, making the attendees aware of the existence of materia medica studies in China.

    After going through various stages of scattered materials and mimeographed booklets, the book "Materia Medica Studies" was finally completed in 1985. However, several science and technology publishers in Shanghai and Zhejiang said they couldn't fit it into their schedule. It was the Nanjing Institute of Technology Press, which specializes in science and engineering books, that said, "As long as the book is good, we can publish it. But you have to raise some of the publishing fees yourself." The amount was 100,000 yuan.

    This 100,000 yuan was a big problem for Chen Chongming. After much thought, he came up with an idea: to publish "materia medica" with the help of "materia medica." He selected a plant from the materia medica that has the effects of strengthening the body, nourishing, and anti-aging, and after refining it, made a health drink. Through sales and technology transfers, he earned 130,000 yuan. However, after various deductions, only 30,000 yuan remained in the project group's account.

    He was really anxious. That year, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, Governor Gu Xiuyan visited the Institute of Botany to see the intellectuals. Most of the attendees were highly respected old scientists. But Chen Chongming, who was at the end of the table, seized an opportunity to stand up and talk about the significance of materia medica studies and the difficulties in publishing the book. The governor said: "The heart blood of two generations is poured into one book, how can it not be published!" Soon, the Provincial Science and Technology Commission allocated 100,000 yuan. The book finally hit the shelves in September of the following year.

    On the cover of this hard-won "Materia Medica Studies," Chen Chongming placed the name of Huang Shengbai, who passed away in 1982, prominently before his own name.

　　陈重明和《本草学》
    本报记者  朱维群
    说起本草，人们立即会联想到李时珍的《本草纲目》。其实自公元一至二世纪出现《神农本草经》以来，中国先后产生了３００多部本草，形成世界上保存最完整、而且至今仍有重要实用价值的药学体系。研究本草发展史，通过所列草药的分析比较而正其名实、纠其谬误，挖掘其在植物学、医药学上的潜在利用价值，是一门新兴学问。１９７２年台湾首先出版打印复印的《本草学》，１９８４年香港出版了《本草研究入门》。最近，４０万字的大陆《本草学》也终于问世了。
    作者陈重明读大学时是果树专业，１９６０年毕业分到江苏省植物研究所，给本草学家黄胜白老先生当助手。当时已７０高龄的黄老每周都带他上山，一样一样教他识别草药。那时国内一些学者认为，本草不科学，不太重视。研究这门学问得耐得住寂寞。老陈下决心坐上二三十年冷板凳，为祖国植物学、医药学补上缺门。
    “文革”中，研究人员统统被赶下乡“斗批改”，科技档案资料也乱得一塌糊涂，所里还有人主张把那些又黄又旧的古籍一把火烧了。陈重明耍了个花招，托人把这些资料存进研究所唯一的“禁区”——人事档案室，本草研究才算免掉一场灭顶之灾。
    １９７７年庐山开了个植物园编辑会议，人微言轻的陈重明争到了１５分钟的发言权，使与会者们知道了中国还有本草学这码事。
    经过零散资料、油印小册子等不同阶段，直到１９８５年，《本草学》写成了。可是上海、浙江几家科技出版社都说排不上队。倒是专出理工书的南京工学院出版社说：“只要书好，我们也可以出。但是你自己得筹点出版费。”数目是１万元。
    这１万元可让陈重明犯了难。他想来想去，蹦出个书呆子式的主意：出“本草”还得靠“本草”。他从本草中选出一种有强身滋补抗衰老作用的植物，经过提炼，制成一种健身饮料。连销售带转让技术，一下赚了１．３万元。可是这笔钱几经提成，到了课题组名下只剩３０００元。
    他真急了。那年中秋节，省长顾秀莲到植物所探望知识分子，在座的大都是德高望重的老科学家。但叨陪末座的陈重明瞅个空子站出来大讲了一番本草学的意义和出书的困境。省长说：两代人的心血写一本书，怎么能不出！不久，省科委拨出１万元。去年９月，书终于问世了。
    在这本来之不易的《本草学》的封面上，陈重明将于１９８２年逝世的黄胜白老先生的名字，赫然排在了自己名字之前。
