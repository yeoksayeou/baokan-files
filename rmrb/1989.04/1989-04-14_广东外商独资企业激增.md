In the first quarter of this year, Guangdong Province successfully negotiated and signed agreements for 43 foreign-funded sole proprietorship projects, utilizing a total of $11.09 million in foreign capital. These figures represent a twofold and 7.8-fold increase, respectively, compared to the same period last year. A report published in the Yangcheng Evening News indicates that the trend of foreign investors establishing sole proprietorships, which began to rise sharply last year, continues to develop.

In the context of financial constraints and economic tightening, attracting foreign investors to establish more sole proprietorships is a crucial aspect of Guangdong's ongoing strategy to develop its coastal regions and implement a policy of openness.

Last year, Guangdong seized the opportunity presented by the global economic restructuring, actively formulated preferential policies, measures, and regulations, and worked to improve both the "hard" and "soft" environments. By adhering to international conventions, Guangdong created conditions that fostered a favorable climate for foreign investors to establish sole proprietorships. Last year, a total of 102 foreign-funded sole proprietorship contracts were signed, utilizing $105.5 million in foreign capital. This amount is equivalent to 70% and 55% of the total foreign capital utilized from 1979 to 1987, respectively.

　　广东外商独资企业激增
    本报讯　今年首季，广东省又有４３个外商独资企业项目谈妥签约，实际利用外资达１１０９万美元，分别比去年同期增长２倍和７．８倍。羊城晚报刊登的报道表明，从去年起呈大幅度上升的外商兴办独资企业势头，至今仍在持续发展。
    在资金紧缺、经济紧缩的情况下，争取外商开办更多的独资企业，是广东继续坚持沿海发展战略、实行网开一面政策的重要一环。
    去年，广东抓住世界经济结构调整的良机，积极制订优惠政策措施和法规条例，努力改善“硬”、“软”环境，按国际惯例创造条件，形成了一个吸引外商创办独资企业的较好的“小气候”。去年共签订外商独资企业合同１０２个，实际利用外资１．０５５亿美元，相当于１９７９—１９８７年总和的７０％和５５％。
