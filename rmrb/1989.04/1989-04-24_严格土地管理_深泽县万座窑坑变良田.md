	Strict Land Management
	Shenze County Turns 10,000 Pits into Fertile Fields

	Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, April 24 (Reporter Guo Suzhi) Shenze County in Hebei Province has transformed 10,000 pits into fertile fields.

	In previous years, some farmers in Shenze County believed that "land belongs to the household, and its use is up to the individual." As a result, they dug pits and burned bricks in their contracted fields without applying for permission. Some villages, towns, and cooperatives saw the profit in brick-making and arbitrarily built brick kilns. Most of these kilns were used only once, and after burning bricks, they were abandoned, leaving piles of rubble and uneven terrain. According to a survey, the county has more than 12,000 abandoned pits, covering over 10,000 mu of land. Calculating at 600 kilograms of grain per mu per year, this affects grain production by 6 million kilograms, equivalent to 40% of the county's grain procurement task.

	After calculating and comparing the costs, officials and the public realized the severity of the problem. The county leadership assigned specific personnel to conduct investigations and issued a notice on restoring and protecting land resources. The notice stipulated that anyone digging pits and burning bricks in arable land must stop immediately and restore the land within a specified period. For those who fail to restore the land on time, the village will send people to clean and level the area, with the household responsible for the costs. Those who obstruct the work or refuse to comply will be fined or have their land confiscated. To prevent farmers from building kilns arbitrarily, the county, following the principle of "unified planning, reasonable layout, and land conservation," has built over 30 brick kilns, ensuring the needs of farmers for building houses.

### 严格土地管理  深泽县万座窑坑变良田

    深泽县万座窑坑变良田
    新华社石家庄４月２４日电（记者郭素芝）河北省深泽县把全县１万多座窑坑变成了良田。
    前些年，深泽县一些农民认为“土地到了户，使用由自己”，于是不经申请便在自己承包田内扣坯烧窑。也有些村、镇和联合体看到烧砖赚钱，擅自建起一批砖窑。这些砖窑大多是“一次性”使用，烧砖后便弃而不管，结果瓦砾遍地，坎坷不平。据调查，全县共有废弃窑坑１．２万多个，共计占地万多亩，以每亩年产粮食６００公斤计算，影响产量６００万公斤，相当于全县粮食定购任务的４０％。
    经过算账对比，使干部群众看到问题的严重性。县领导机关抽出专人进行调查，并就恢复和保护土地资源问题发出通报，规定凡属在耕地扣坯烧窑者，一律停止，并限期平整恢复；对不能按期恢复的，由乡村派人进行清理平整，户主负责费用；对阻挠施工、不听劝阻者，分别给予罚款、没收土地等处分。为防止农民乱建窑，县里按照“统一规划，合理布局，节约耕地”的原则，先后建起３０多座砖窑，保证了农民盖房需要。
