To strengthen the management of prices for non-plan production materials, the state will start implementing uniform maximum prices for steel, copper, aluminum, nickel, tin, zinc, and related major raw materials, which are currently high and chaotic in the market, from April 15. This was disclosed by an official from the State Pricing Bureau.

The official said that, with the approval of the State Council, the State Pricing Bureau, the Ministry of Materials, the Ministry of Metallurgy, and the General Company of Non-Ferrous Metals recently reissued the nationwide uniform maximum prices for non-plan black and colored metals to various regions. Adjustments have been made to the price limits set last year, and the range of price-controlled items has been expanded. Both factory prices and sales prices are controlled, and the operating cost rate for material trading enterprises is strictly regulated. The price-controlled products, regardless of how many links they go through, must not exceed the maximum sales price, thereby limiting unnecessary circulation links and stopping the resale and price gouging.

At the same time as implementing price controls on some steel, copper, and aluminum, price controls have also been implemented on their main raw materials—pig iron, scrap steel, steel billets, steel ingots, copper concentrate, blister copper, and alumina.

The official emphasized that the nationwide uniform maximum prices set this time must not be exceeded by any region, department, unit, or individual. Violators will be investigated and dealt with.

　　计划外黑色和有色金属
　　国家实行统一最高限价
    据新华社北京４月１１日电　（记者郭君正）为了加强对计划外生产资料的价格管理，国家将从４月１５日开始，对当前市场上价格既高又乱的计划外钢材、铜、铝、镍、锡、锌以及相关的主要原材料实行统一最高限价。这是国家物价局一位负责人透露的。
    这位负责人说，经国务院批准，国家物价局、物资部、冶金部和有色金属总公司近日向各地重新颁布了计划外黑色、有色金属的全国统一最高限价，对去年颁布的限价水平做了适当调整，并扩大了限价的品种范围，既限出厂价格，又限销售价格，同时严格规定了物资经营企业的经营费率。限价产品不论经过多少环节，均不得突破最高销售限价，从而将起到限制不必要的流通环节和制止倒买倒卖、哄抬物价的作用。在对部分钢材、铜、铝实行限价的同时，也分别对生产它们的主要原材料——生铁、废钢、钢坯、钢锭、铜精矿、粗铜和氧化铝等实行了限价。
    这位负责人强调，这次规定的全国统一最高限价，任何地区、任何部门、任何单位及个人，都不得突破，违者将受到查处。
