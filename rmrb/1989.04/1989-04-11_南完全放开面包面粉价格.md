Yugoslavia's federal government has decided to fully deregulate the prices of flour and bread starting from April 8, allowing them to be freely determined by market conditions.

With this decision, the prices of all basic food items previously controlled by the government have been fully deregulated. Allowing prices to be formed based on market principles is one of the fundamental policies of the new Markovic government.

According to an estimate by the Yugoslav Economic Union on April 7, Yugoslavia's inflation rate for April is expected to rise by 30%. In the first quarter of this year, Yugoslavia's inflation rate has already reached 397.5%.
