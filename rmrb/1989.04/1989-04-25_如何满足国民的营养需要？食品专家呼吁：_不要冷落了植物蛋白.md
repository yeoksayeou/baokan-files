Protein is a major nutrient required by the human body. The protein intake standard promoted by the Chinese government is 75 grams per person per day, which is below the world average. However, according to authoritative departments, the current national average protein consumption per person per day is only 67 grams. This indicates that our nutrition is insufficient.

What can be done to meet the nutritional needs of the people? Currently, people generally emphasize the development of meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy products, which is indeed an effective method. However, the investment is too high, and the national strength is insufficient. Taking pork as an example, the current consumption of pork per person per year for the Chinese people, who are at the subsistence level, is 12.5 kilograms. In the future, when entering a moderately prosperous level, pork consumption will increase to 25 kilograms. To achieve this consumption level, the country's investment in pig farming will amount to 10 billion yuan.

However, if each person eats a little soybean every day, it can meet the national standard for protein intake. Therefore, many food experts suggest: the plant protein food processing industry should be vigorously developed.

Plant proteins made from soybeans and peanuts as the main raw materials have complete nutritional components and high nutritional value. The protein content is as high as 55% or more, equivalent to 3.5 times that of pork, 18 times that of milk, and 4 times that of eggs. They also contain nearly 20 amino acids lacking in animal meat, as well as trace elements such as potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, iron, copper, manganese, zinc, and vitamins. They can partially replace meat, milk, and eggs. If used in the production of tens of thousands of traditional foods such as pastries, meat products, candies, and cold drinks, not only will the nutritional value and intrinsic quality of traditional foods be improved and enhanced, but also the color, aroma, and taste of traditional foods can be maintained. Adding plant proteins to meat products can also reduce cholesterol content, and improve taste and flavor.

In fact, plant proteins have long been an indispensable raw material in the food industry of many countries. The use of plant proteins originated in Japan and the United States. In 1975 alone, the United States produced nearly 500,000 tons of plant proteins. By the late 1970s, 70% of food factories in Japan were adding plant proteins to more than 10,000 types of foods.

China also began using plant proteins in the 1950s. Due to insufficient attention, progress has been slow, and there are still very few food factories that add plant proteins. Currently, the annual production of plant proteins in the country is less than 70,000 tons, and the resource utilization rate is less than 1%.

China has abundant plant protein resources, producing 7.5 billion kilograms of soybeans and 3.5 billion kilograms of peanuts annually, ranking among the world's top. For a long time, a considerable portion of soybeans and peanuts have been exported. The domestic utilization part is only used for vegetable oil. The cake residue, which is rich in protein after oil extraction, is used as feed. Only about 15% of the protein is absorbed and converted into animal protein by livestock and poultry, resulting in a waste of a large amount of protein resources. According to experts' calculations, if these cake residues are processed into edible proteins, 7.8 billion kilograms of plant protein products can be obtained, equivalent to the protein provided by 28 billion kilograms of pork. If half of the national soybean and peanut production is used to process plant proteins, it can increase the value by 11 billion yuan compared to the traditional oil extraction method.

When analyzing the reasons for the slow progress in promoting the use of plant proteins in China, experts pointed out that currently, more than 99% of food factories lack understanding of plant proteins and are unwilling to use them as raw materials. Instead, they compete to develop meat, egg, and dairy products, vying for these limited resources.

For this reason, food experts call for: the state should formulate preferential policies to encourage the development and utilization of plant proteins. Relevant research departments should develop more formulas for products that add plant proteins and recommend them to food manufacturers to quickly change the food structure in China, increase the utilization of plant proteins, reduce the national burden, improve enterprise efficiency, and improve the nutritional level of the people.

　　如何满足国民的营养需要？食品专家呼吁：   
    不要冷落了植物蛋白
    赵明亮　魏晓峰
    蛋白质是人体所需的主要营养成分。我国政府推广的蛋白质摄取标准为：每人每天７５克，这是一个低于世界平均水平的标准。但据权威部门调查，目前全国城乡居民每人每天的蛋白消费量仅６７克。这表明，我们营养不足。
    靠什么来满足国民的营养需要？当前人们普遍看重发展肉、禽、蛋、奶，这当然是行之有效的办法，但投入太大，国力不济。以猪肉为例，目前处于温饱水平的我国人民每人每年的猪肉消费量为１２．５公斤，将来进入小康水平时，猪肉消费量将要增加到２５公斤。达到这个消费数量，国家用于发展养猪的投资要１００亿元。
    然而，如果每人每天吃点黄豆，即可达到国家规定的蛋白质摄取标准。因此，许多食品专家建议：应当大力发展植物蛋白食品加工业。
    以大豆、花生为主要原料的植物蛋白营养成份齐全，具有很高的营养价值。其中蛋白含量高达５５％以上，相当于猪肉的３．５倍、牛奶的１８倍、鸡蛋的４倍，并含有近２０种动物肉中所缺少的氨基酸及钾、钠、钙、镁、铁、铜、锰、锌、维生素等微量元素，可部分代替肉、奶、蛋，若用于糕点、肉制品、糖果、冷饮等上万种传统食品的制作，既提高和改善了传统食品的营养价值和内在品质，又可保持传统食品的色、香、味。肉制品中添加植物蛋白，还可降低胆固醇含量，口感、风味均有改善。
    实际上，植物蛋白早已成为许多国家食品工业不可缺少的原料。世界上利用植物蛋白起源于日本和美国。美国仅１９７５年的植物蛋白产量就有近５０万吨。日本７０年代末就有７０％的食品厂在１万多种食品中添加了植物蛋白。
    我国也在５０年代开始利用植物蛋白。由于重视不够，进展缓慢，至今添加植物蛋白的食品厂寥寥无几。目前全国植物蛋白的年产量尚不足７万吨，资源利用率不到１％。
    我国植物蛋白资源极为丰富，年产大豆７５亿公斤，花生米３５亿公斤，居世界前列。长期以来，相当大一部分大豆、花生用于出口。国内利用部分也只是取其植物油，榨油后含有丰富蛋白质的饼粕却被用作饲料，其中仅有１５％左右的蛋白被畜禽吸收转化为动物蛋白，大量的蛋白资源白白浪费了。据专家测算，如果将这些饼粕加工成食用蛋白，可得植物蛋白产品７８亿公斤，相当于２８０亿公斤猪肉提供的蛋白质。若将全国大豆、花生产量的一半加工植物蛋白，比传统的榨油法加工可净增值１１０亿元。
    专家们在分析我国推广利用植物蛋白进展缓慢的原因时指出，目前９９％以上的食品厂对植物蛋白还缺乏认识，不愿把它作为原料，却竞相开发肉、蛋、奶食品，去争抢这些有限的资源。
    为此，食品专家们呼吁：国家应制定鼓励发展和利用植物蛋白的优惠政策，有关科研部门要多研制一些添加植物蛋白产品的配方，推荐给食品厂家，以尽快改变我国食品结构，增加对植物蛋白的利用，减轻国家负担，提高企业效益，改善国民营养水平。
