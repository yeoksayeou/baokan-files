	On the 40th anniversary of the founding of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, approximately 4,000 British citizens today held a demonstration and march in central London, demanding a reduction in military spending and an increase in funding for healthcare and social services.

	This demonstration was organized by a group called the "Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament." The group's leader stated that NATO member countries annually allocate a significant amount of funds to enhance military capabilities, while domestic basic projects such as education, healthcare, and housing do not receive adequate development.

	The demonstrators also opposed the deployment of new missiles in Western Europe under the pretext of "modernization."

　　北约成立４０周年之际
    英群众要求减少军费
    新华社伦敦４月２日电  在北大西洋公约组织成立４０周年的时候，约４０００名英国人今天在伦敦市中心举行示威游行，要求减少军费，增加保健和社会服务开支。
    这次示威是由一个名叫“争取核裁军运动”的组织发起的。该组织负责人说，北约各国每年都把大量的经费用来扩充军事实力，与此同时，国内的教育、保健、住房等基础项目却得不到应有的发展。
    示威者还反对以“更新”为借口在西欧部署新导弹。
