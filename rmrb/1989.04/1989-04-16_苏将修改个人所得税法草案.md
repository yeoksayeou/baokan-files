Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 15th.

The Soviet Union will submit the draft of the revised personal income tax law for public discussion today.

The draft stipulates that individuals with a monthly income exceeding 700 rubles will be subject to personal income tax, calculated on a progressive scale. The higher the income, the higher the tax. For those with a monthly income between 701 and 900 rubles, the tax will be 86 rubles 20 kopecks plus 15% of the amount exceeding 700 rubles. For those with a monthly income of 1500 rubles or more, the tax will be 296 rubles 20 kopecks plus 50% of the amount exceeding 1500 rubles.

The draft also specifies that individuals earning more than 1200 rubles annually from copyrights, publications, or the use of scientific, literary, or artistic works will be taxed on the same principle. However, income from awards such as the Lenin Prize, the State Prize of the USSR, and the Prize of the Council of Ministers of the USSR will not be taxed, even if it exceeds the amounts specified in the draft.

The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR requests that all opinions from the discussion be summarized by June 1st to facilitate further revisions.

　　苏将修改个人所得税法草案
    新华社莫斯科４月１５日电　苏联今天将居民个人所得税法修改草案提交全民讨论。
    草案规定对月收入在７００卢布以上者交纳个人所得税，采取累进计算的办法。收入越多，纳税越高。个人月收入在７０１至９００卢布者，每月交税８６卢布２０戈比再加上超过７００卢布部分的１５％。而月收入在１５００卢布以上者，则需交税２９６卢布２０戈比再加上超过１５００卢布部分的５０％。
    草案规定，由于版权、出版或利用科学、文学、艺术著作获得报酬年收入超过１２００卢布者，纳税原则一样。但获得的列宁奖金、苏联国家奖金和苏联部长会议奖金等的收入，即使超过草案规定的数额，也不需要纳税。
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团要求在６月１日前把讨论的意见汇总，以便作进一步修改。
