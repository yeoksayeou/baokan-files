The Central Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China, the State Economic Reform Commission, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions today, at the Fifth Annual Meeting of the Chinese Workers' Ideological and Political Work Research Association, awarded the title of "1988 National Advanced Enterprise in Ideological and Political Work" to 100 enterprises and the title of "National Advanced Enterprise Ideological and Political Worker" to 100 individuals.

After reviewing and verifying the work of these enterprises in 1988, the titles of three enterprises were revoked. Among them, the Shanghai Gaojing Petrochemical Company Refinery and the Jiangxi Xinyu Iron and Steel Plant had major accidents in 1988, while the Zhejiang Lanjiang Smelting Plant held extravagant celebrations for its anniversary, distributed money and goods recklessly, and engaged in wasteful spending.

    表彰企业思想政治工作先进  百个单位百名个人榜上有名
    同时取消原先三家工厂的优秀称号
    本报南京４月２日电  中共中央宣传部、国家经济体制改革委员会、全国总工会，今天在中国职工思想政治工作研究会第五届年会上，授予１００个企业“１９８８年度全国思想政治工作优秀企业”称号，授予１００位同志“全国优秀企业思想政治工作者”称号。
    在前两届年会上，已授予１９４个企业全国思想政治工作优秀企业称号，经过对这些企业１９８８年度工作的考察核实，对三个单位优秀企业的称号不予保留。其中，上海高桥石化公司炼油厂、江西新余钢铁厂１９８８年发生重大事故，浙江兰江冶炼厂厂庆大操大办，滥发钱物，铺张浪费。
