Li Peng Visits the Fukuoka Expo and Meets Local Chinese Overseas and Students

Our reporter Yu Qing reports from Fukuoka on April 16: Today is the last day of Premier Li Peng's visit to Japan. After visiting an agricultural project in the morning, he came to the "Asia-Pacific Expo" in the afternoon.

The Asia-Pacific Expo is an international exhibition organized by Fukuoka City, with 37 countries and regions, including China, participating. The entire exhibition site is built on reclaimed land. Since its opening on March 17, it has attracted an average of four to five hundred thousand visitors daily.

Li Peng and his entourage first visited the theme pavilion, where the most eye-catching exhibit is a pair of gold seals. One of them, unearthed over 200 years ago on Shika Island in Fukuoka, is inscribed with the characters "Han Wei Nuo Wang" (King of Han Wei Nuo), with a snake-shaped handle, and is now housed in the Fukuoka Art Museum. The other, inscribed with "Guangling Wang Xi" (Seal of the King of Guangling), with a fish-shaped handle, is housed in the Nanjing Museum in China and was borrowed for this exhibition. The two seals are similar in size and thickness, and their inscriptions are in the same style of Chinese calligraphy. According to research, both were made during the Later Han Dynasty in China and are likely to be "brother seals" from the same workshop in Luoyang. Nearly 2,000 years later, the two seals meet here, illustrating the long history of Sino-Japanese exchanges.

Li Peng then visited the Gas Pavilion and the Chinese Pavilion. Finally, he ascended the newly built Fukuoka Tower, the tallest structure on the Japanese coast at 234 meters high, from which he could see the entire landscape of Fukuoka City and the scenic views of Hakata Bay.

In the afternoon, Premier Li Peng warmly met with local Chinese overseas and representatives of Chinese students at the Chinese Consulate General in Fukuoka. He also visited the staff of the Consulate General and the China Civil Aviation Office.

After taking group photos with everyone, Li Peng spoke about the significance and achievements of his visit. He told the representatives of the Chinese overseas community that he hoped they would live in harmony with the Japanese people and contribute to the promotion of Sino-Japanese friendship and cooperation. To the student representatives, Li Peng urged them to study the good experiences and technologies of Japan and serve the modernization of their motherland upon their return.

　　李鹏参观福冈博览会
　　会见当地华侨、留学生代表和我机构人员
    本报福冈４月１６日电　记者于青报道：今天是李鹏总理一行访问日本的最后一天。上午参观农业项目之后，下午李鹏来到“亚洲太平洋博览会”参观。
    亚太博览会是福冈市主办的一次国际博览会，中国等３７个国家和地区参展。整个会场是填海造地建成的。３月１７日开幕以来，平均每天约有四五万人前来参观。
    李鹏一行首先来到主题馆，最引人注目的是一对金印。其一，是２００多年前，在福冈志贺岛出土的，上刻“汉委奴国王”五字，印柄为蛇，现藏福冈美术馆。另一个现藏中国南京博物馆，由博览会借来参展，上刻“广陵王玺”四字，印柄为鱼。两颗金印大小厚薄相似，字体同属汉隶。据考证，均制于中国后汉时期，可能是出于洛阳同一工房的“兄弟印”。近２０００年后，两印在此相见，说明中日交流源远流长。
    然后，李鹏总理先后参观了煤气馆、中国馆。最后登上新建的、高度为２３４米的日本海滨第一高塔福冈塔，福冈市景和博多海湾风光尽收眼底。
    李鹏总理今天下午在中国驻福冈总领事馆亲切会见了当地的华侨和中国留学生代表，并看望了总领馆和中国民航办事处人员。
    李鹏和大家分批合影留念后，向大家讲了他这次访问的意义与成果。他对华侨代表们说，希望华侨与日本人民和睦相处，为推进中日友好合作作出贡献。对留学生代表们，李鹏嘱咐他们努力学习日本好的经验和技术，回国后为祖国的四化建设服务。
