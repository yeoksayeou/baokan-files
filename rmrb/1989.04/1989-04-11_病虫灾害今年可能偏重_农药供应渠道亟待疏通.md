Today, the National Plant Protection Station of the Ministry of Agriculture issued a forecast that this year's crop pests and diseases, such as those affecting grains and oils, may be more severe. However, there is a significant gap in the supply of pesticides, and the supply channels are not smooth.

Due to the warm winter, the pest population density in the fields is higher than in previous years. Since March, powdery mildew on wheat has begun to occur widely in the Huai River region, and the disease is developing rapidly. Wheat leaf blotch in the winter wheat areas of Jianghuai is also quite common.

To ensure that pesticides reach farmers as soon as possible, the state has implemented a monopoly on pesticide sales. This has played an active role in curbing profiteering, stabilizing prices, and preventing counterfeit products from entering the market. However, after the implementation of the pesticide monopoly, some new situations and problems have emerged that deserve high attention and need to be addressed immediately.

First, although there is a high demand for pesticides during the spring plowing season in various places, some areas have experienced the strange phenomenon of pesticide surpluses. Zhejiang Province usually exports over 20,000 tons of pesticides to other provinces each year, but this year the contracted quantity of pesticides has decreased by 30% compared to last year. The triazole produced by Dongyang Pesticide Factory is a special medicine for treating rice blast disease, which was in high demand in previous years, but currently, it is not being ordered and production has stopped. The Tai Zhou Pesticide Factory in Jiangsu Province has over 100 tons of DDT and diazinon in stock. These two medicines are in high demand by farmers, but the monopoly departments have not ordered much.

Second, local blockades are affecting the circulation of pesticides. When the Qingdao Pesticide Factory was built, it lacked funds and attracted investment from other provinces, stipulating that the factory would provide 500 tons of pesticides to the investors each year. This year, Shandong Province does not allow pesticides to be exported out of the province, and the problem remains unresolved.

Currently, farmers urgently need pesticides, and relevant departments should strengthen production and sales coordination, eliminate blockades, and activate circulation to ensure that the accumulated pesticides are quickly delivered.

### 病虫灾害今年可能偏重　农药供应渠道亟待疏通

　　病虫灾害今年可能偏重
　　农药供应渠道亟待疏通
    本报北京四月十日讯　记者陈满正报道：农业部全国植保总站今天发出预报，今年粮油等作物病虫害将偏重发生。但农药供应缺口不小，供应渠道不畅。
    由于冬暖，田间虫口密度高于常年同期。进入三月份以来，小麦白粉病在江淮流域开始普遍发生，病情发展很快。麦纹枯病在江淮冬麦区发病也较普遍。
    为了使农药尽快到达农民手中，国家对农药实行了专营。这对制止中间盘剥，平抑价格，防止假冒商品上市，均起了积极作用。但是，农药专营后，也出现一些新情况、新问题，值得高度重视，并立即设法解决。
    一是各地春耕急需农药，但一些地方却出现了农药滞销的怪事。浙江每年销往外省农药两万多吨，今年订购农药合同量比去年减少百分之三十。东阳农药厂生产的三环唑是防治稻瘟病的特效药，往年都是抢手货，时下却因无人订货而停产。江苏泰州农药厂库存敌百虫、滴滴畏一百多吨。这两种药都是农民催要的紧俏货，但专营部门订货不多。
    二是地方封锁，影响农药流通。青岛农药厂建厂时资金不足，吸引了外省投资，规定药厂每年向对方提供农药五百吨。今年山东不准农药出省，问题至今得不到解决。
    当前，农民急需农药，有关部门应加强产销协调，消除封锁，搞活流通，使积存的农药赶快到位。
