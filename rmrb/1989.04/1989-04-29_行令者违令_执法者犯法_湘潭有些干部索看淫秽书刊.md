    Those Who Enforce the Law Break the Law
    Some Officials in Xiangtan Demand to View Obscene Books

    During the inspection of the "Tan Zhou Rental Bookstore" by the Xiangtan City Cultural Market Rectification Group, it was discovered that a significant proportion of the readers who rented illegal publications and obscene books were officials. This issue is particularly severe across the entire city.

    According to the store owner, Liu Zhenliang, these officials were mostly from the departments of industry and commerce, property management, and public security. To curry favor with them, the store did its best to meet their demands, sometimes even allowing them to view the books for free. The obscene book "The Carnal Prayer Mat," published during the Qing Dynasty, has been repeatedly banned by the state. However, Liu Zhenliang managed to obtain five copies at the beginning of this year. The number of officials who rented these books accounted for more than 30% of the total rentals. After they had their fill, they protected the bookstore. Whenever there was an inspection, they would tip off the store in advance. On February 18, Vice Mayor Wu Kewen led a surprise inspection and seized 703 illegal publications and obscene books hidden in the walls, all of which were confiscated. That afternoon, the market public security bureau received numerous phone calls pleading for leniency, with some complaining about the lack of thorough investigation and others even criticizing the action as "too extreme."

    On March 17, the rectification group inspected the bookstalls at Xiangtan Mining Institute and seized over 200 illegal publications, including multiple copies of "The Carnal Prayer Mat" and other obscene books. Prior to this, relevant officials had claimed that there were no issues here.

    Individual business owners in the city reported that these officials, who were actually from urban management, industry and commerce, taxation, and certain government agencies, were collecting books under the name of the public security bureau. They did not show any identification or provide receipts for the books they collected, effectively keeping them for themselves. The obscene books that were confiscated had already been clearly defined by the state, but the relevant leaders insisted on "reviewing" them again. For years, people only heard about books being collected but never saw any being turned in. The public was very displeased with this.

　　行令者违令　执法者犯法    
    湘潭有些干部索看淫秽书刊
    湘潭市文化市场整顿小组在审查“潭州租书店”时，发现租阅非法出版物和淫秽书刊的读者群中有关干部竟占了相当大的比例。全市此类问题十分严重。
    据这家租书店老板刘贞良交待：那些干部多为工商管理员、房产干部和公安干警。为了讨好他们，店里尽量满足其要求，有时还让其白看。出自清朝的淫书《玉蒲团》，国家多次严令禁版禁阅，今年初刘贞良设法搞到５本，有关工作人员租阅的竟占总租阅数的３０％以上。既已饱享眼福，便对书店多加庇护，一旦清查则提前通风报信。２月１８日，副市长伍克文带队突击搜查，将在夹墙中查获的７０３本非法出版物和淫秽书刊全部扣押，当天下午说情的电话不断打到市公安局，有的埋怨没经充分研究，有的甚至指责“这样做太过分”。
    ３月１７日，整顿小组清查湘潭矿业学院书摊，搜出非法出版物２００多本，缴获《玉蒲团》等多种淫秽书刊。事前有关干部曾声称这里没有问题。
    城里个体户反映，那些工作人员明明是城管、工商、税收和某些机关的，却打着公安局的名义收书，他们既不出示证明，又不开具收书条子，实则据为己有。收缴的淫秽书刊国家早已明文审定，有关领导偏要再“审查”，几年来只闻下面收书，不见一本上交。对此群众十分反感。
