On the Dutch Queen's May Visit to China, Dutch Prime Minister Accepts Interview with Our Reporter

The Hague, April 26 (Xinhua) — On the morning of the 25th, Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers accepted an interview with a Chinese reporter regarding the Dutch Queen's upcoming official visit to China in May. He stated that this visit shows that the Netherlands has a deep interest in China's politics, economy, and culture, and hopes that the relationship between the two countries will become even friendlier and closer.

Lubbers said that since the visit of then Premier Zhao Ziyang to the Netherlands in 1985, bilateral relations have continued to develop, which is gratifying. The areas of cooperation between the two countries are quite broad. Large, medium, and small enterprises in the Netherlands can provide China with advanced technology; in the export of agricultural products, they can also provide China with advanced knowledge.

When discussing China's reforms and opening up, the Prime Minister believed that China seems to have encountered some difficulties at present, which is a phenomenon encountered in the development process and is understandable. He expressed great concern for China's situation.

He also expressed support for China's early restoration of its status as a contracting party to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

　　就荷兰女王五月访华
    荷首相接受我记者采访
    本报海牙４月２６日电  记者魏崴报道：２５日上午荷兰首相吕贝尔斯就荷兰女王陛下将于５月首次正式访华接受中国记者采访，说这表明荷兰对中国政治、经济和文化各方面均怀有浓厚兴趣，希望两国关系更加友好密切。
    吕贝尔斯说，自１９８５年时任总理的赵紫阳访问荷兰以来，双边关系持续发展，令人欣慰。两国合作领域较为广阔。荷兰的大、中、小企业可为中国提供尖端技术；在农产品出口方面也能为中国提供先进的知识。
    谈及中国的改革和开放时，首相认为，中国眼下似乎碰到一些困难，这是发展过程中遇到的现象，容易理解。他对中国的形势表示十分关注。
    他还表示支持中国早日恢复关贸总协定缔约国地位的立场。
