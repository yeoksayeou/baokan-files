Today, the Beijing Workers' Cultural Palace was unusually crowded. The talent and technology exchange and introduction meeting held here by Beijing Municipality and Hebei Province attracted many people who wanted to better utilize their talents or find a more ideal job.

Some joint ventures in Beijing were particularly eye-catching. Crowds gathered around their booths. Hebei Province, on the other hand, posted advertisements outside the main hall: "For any technology introduced, digested, and absorbed by our province, or for new technology products developed, 15-25% of the net income from the technology can be awarded to the relevant personnel, with no tax on the award..." This also attracted many people. Many Beijing scientists and technicians eagerly introduced their projects and technologies to the Hebei representatives. Some tried to push uncertified projects onto the Hebei representatives, but they were quite shrewd and would not easily be deceived.

Some out-of-town students from Beijing's universities, seeing that they had little hope of staying in Beijing, quickly turned to the nearest province, Hebei. Zhang Yong, a graduate student from Beijing Institute of Chemical Technology, filled out a form at the recruitment office of Chengde City early in the morning. He was willing to work at the city's liquefied gas company, believing that "the specialty is very relevant." A retired accountant from Beijing, Liu Bingyu, was willing to go to Xingtai to "utilize his remaining skills." He said, "I wanted to find a job near Beijing, but they insisted on a diploma. Hebei Province is more open-minded; they don't require a diploma, so I am willing to go."

Some distant suburbs and counties of Beijing also had significant gains. This morning, at least a dozen job seekers filled out registration forms at the reception desk of Huairou County. A senior engineer said, "I can't fully utilize my abilities in my current unit. If I go to your place, I have no material demands; I only hope to see my project start as soon as possible. Of course, before the project is completed, it must be kept confidential."

Officials from the Beijing Municipal Talent Exchange Service Center said that such activities are held twice a year in Beijing, attracting many people with high hopes.

So, how many people came today?

The ticket seller at the main hall entrance estimated that by noon, at least 5,000 people had come. The visitors said, "Spending 1 yuan to find a good job is worth it!"

　　活水源源来
　　——京冀人才技术交流会侧记
　　本报记者　蒋涵箴　蒋建科
    今天一早，北京劳动人民文化宫“游人”格外多。北京市、河北省在这里举办的人才、技术交流引进洽谈会，吸引了无数想更好地发挥自己才能，或者寻觅一个更为理想工作岗位的人们。
    北京的一些合资企业是最招人注意的地方。它们的招牌下，围了好几层人。河北省则在大殿外张贴广告：“凡承担我省技术引进消化吸收、新技术产品开发的科技成果，可从取得的技术纯收入中提取15—25％奖励有关人员，均不计奖金税……”这一招也很吸引人。一些北京的科技人员纷纷向河北人介绍自己的项目、技术。有人想把未经过鉴定的项目塞给河北人，可他们相当精明，决不轻易上当。
    北京各大学的一些外地籍学生看到自己“留京无望”，马上转向离京最近的河北。北京化工学院研究生张勇一大早就在承德市的招聘处填下了表格，他愿意上该市的液化气公司工作，认为“专业很对口”。北京市的一位退休老会计师刘炳玉愿意到邢台去“发挥余热”。他说：“我想就近在北京找一个工作，可他们非要文凭不可。河北省就比较开通，没文凭也要，所以我愿意去。”
    北京的一些远郊区、县也颇有收获。今天上午至少有十几位应招者在怀柔县接待站填了登记表。一位高级工程师说：“我在本单位不能很好发挥作用。到你们那儿去，我没有任何物质要求，只要求能早日看到自己的项目能搞起来。当然事情未成之前一定要保密。”
    市人才交流服务中心的同志说，这样的活动，北京市每年举办两次，来人很多，人们抱的希望也很大。
    那么，今天到底来了多少人？
    大殿门口售票员估计，到中午时至少有5000人。来者说，花1元钱，找一个好工作，值得！
