Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 7th.

Poland's parliament passed a decree on April 7th, making significant amendments to the Constitution of the Polish People's Republic.

The amendments primarily include three aspects:

First, it stipulates that Poland will adopt a presidential system. The president will be elected by a joint session of the parliament and the senate through democratic elections. As the head of state, the president is the highest representative of Poland both domestically and internationally. The president oversees the implementation of the constitution, safeguards national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and upholds the political and military alliances that the state has established with foreign countries. When necessary, the president has the right to dissolve the parliament.

Second, it stipulates the establishment of a senate. The senate is responsible for reviewing all laws and decrees passed by the parliament, except for the budget law, and then making suggestions for amendments or revocation to the parliament. The parliament, as the highest authority of the state, can, with at least half of its members present, reject the senate's suggestions with a two-thirds majority vote.

Third, it stipulates that candidates for parliament and senate members will be selected through democratic nomination procedures. Citizen organizations with at least 3,000 members have the right to jointly nominate their own candidates. The Polish parliament also passed, with an overwhelming majority, the long-awaited "Parliament Election Law," "Senate Election Law," "Association Law," "Amendment to the Trade Union Law," and the "Law on Individual Farmers' Associations."

Observers here believe that the passage of the "Amendment to the Trade Union Law" and the "Law on Individual Farmers' Associations" has paved the way for the legalization of Solidarity Trade Union and Solidarity Farmers' Union. It is expected that within a week, they will appear on the Polish political stage in a legal capacity.

　　波兰对宪法作重大修改
    改行总统制　增设参议院
    议员和参议员由民主选举产生
    新华社华沙４月７日电  波兰议会７日通过法令，对波兰人民共和国宪法作出重大修改。
    修改的内容主要有三个方面：
    一、规定波兰改行总统制。总统由议会和参议院联席会议民主选举产生。总统作为国家元首是波兰国家对内对外的最高代表。总监督宪法的实施，维护国家主权和领土完整，维护国家同外国缔结的政治和军事联盟。必要时，总统有权宣布解散议会。
    二、规定增设参议院。参议院负责审议议会通过的除预算法之外的所有法律和法令，然后向议会提出修改或撤消的建议。而议会作为国家最高权力机构，在起码有半数议员在场情况下，可以２／３的多数票拒绝接受参议院的建议。
    三、规定议员和参议员候选人由民主推选程序产生。满３０００人的公民组织有权联名推选自己的候选人。波兰议会还以绝大多数票赞成通过了酝酿已久的《议会选举法》、《参议院选举法》、《结社法》、“工会法修正案”以及《个体农民农会法》。
    此间观察家认为，“工会法修正案”和“个体农民农会法”的通过，为团结工会和团结农会的合法化铺平了道路。预计一周后它们将以合法地位出现在波兰政治舞台。
