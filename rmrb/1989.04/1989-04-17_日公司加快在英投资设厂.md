Japanese Companies Accelerate Investment and Factory Establishment in the UK

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Beijing on April 17, the *Asian Wall Street Journal* reported that recently, major Japanese companies have significantly accelerated their pace of establishing factories in the UK. Companies such as Fujitsu and Toyota have announced their plans to set up factories.

Factors such as relatively lower labor costs and a thriving economy in the UK have strongly attracted Japanese manufacturers. Additionally, the widespread proficiency in English among Japanese business leaders is another reason they prefer to invest in the UK.

Currently, approximately 392 major Japanese companies have either established branches in Europe or announced plans to do so, with 92 of these in the UK, accounting for 23%, higher than the 16% in 1983. It is estimated that by 1992, this proportion will reach 29%.

　　日公司加快在英投资设厂
    据新华社北京４月１７日电　据《亚洲华尔街日报》报道，最近一段时间，日本大公司在英国设厂的步伐明显加快，富士通、丰田等公司纷纷宣布了设厂的计划。
    英国的劳动力成本相对较低、经济繁荣等因素有力地吸引着日本制造商。另外，日本的企业领导人普遍通晓英语也是他们喜欢去英国投资的原因之一。
    目前，约有３９２家日本大公司已经在欧洲开设了分支机构或已宣布了此类计划，其中９２家在英国，占２３％，高于１９８３年的１６％。预计到１９９２年这一比例将达到２９％。
