Once the New Year begins, the broadcast of television dramas on China Central Television (CCTV) starts to pick up pace. By March 15th, a crucial deadline, all dramas vying for the "Feitian Award" must have aired on CCTV. Thus, starting with "Family Education," television series after television series have taken over the prime-time slots, even leading to high-quality single-episode dramas like "White Mountain Ridge" and "The Seventh Man Is a Deserter" being relegated to daytime broadcasts. While television viewers might find it hard to keep up, they are certainly enjoying a feast for the eyes. However, some of the judges for the "Feitian Award" are feeling the pressure. A few days ago, one judge candidly said, "I'm sorry, but I'll have to take a leave of absence for this round of judging. It's just too hard to decide this year."

Whether this judge will actually take a leave of absence, I do not know, but the statement "It's just too hard to decide this year" is indeed true. Dramas like "Family Education," "Green Shadows," and "Teacher's Soul," which have left a deep impression on millions of television viewers, all have a good chance of winning. However, there are also many other strong contenders, such as the highly acclaimed "The Last Emperor," the adaptation of the classic novel "Family Spring and Autumn," and the masterfully directed "The Fifth." The list of potential winners can go on, but the number of "Feitian Award" winners is limited.

Take, for example, Li Baotian, who won the Best Actor award last year for his role as Ge Shihang. This year, his performance in "Teacher's Soul" is undoubtedly even better. Could the winner of the "Feitian Award" for Best Actor also be re-elected, like some foreign presidents?

Additionally, do not overlook a detail: after the "Feitian Award" was announced last year, there were many criticisms in the media. The judges experienced the taste of "public opinion supervision" for the first time, and they couldn't help but wonder, "Why is being a judge for the 'Feitian Award' so difficult and thankless?"

However, from another perspective, the difficulties in the selection process for the "Feitian Award" can easily turn into good things.

"It's just too hard to decide this year!" This is because there are more equally matched contending dramas this year compared to previous years, which indicates that our television drama art has improved.

Regardless of the outcome of the Best Actor selection, people will remember that it is our television screens that have provided outstanding actors like Li Baotian with a platform to continuously showcase their talents.

As for "public opinion supervision," it is indeed a good thing. If "public opinion supervision" can urge government officials to be clean, then it can also urge judges to be fair.

However, artistic competitions are not like sports competitions; their comparability is relative. This is the insurmountable difficulty of the "Feitian Award" (including the Oscars and all other film and television awards). But it is precisely because of this difficulty that it demands even greater impartiality from the judges, and it also makes the related parties even more eagerly anticipate the award results.

### “飞天奖”缘何难评

　　“飞天奖”缘何难评
　　童道明
    元旦一过，中央电视台的电视剧播映开始“紧锣密鼓”。因为3月15日是个“坎”，参加“飞天奖”角逐的电视剧，都得在这之前到中央台的屏幕上亮相。于是从《家教》开始，电视连续剧一个接一个地占据了晚间节目的黄金时刻，以致像《白色山岗》、《第七个是逃兵》这样很有质量的单本剧，也只好被委屈安排在白天播放。电视观众尽管有点“目不暇接”，但毕竟“大饱眼福”。有些“飞天奖”的评委倒犯了愁。几天前，一位评委说了句掏心窝的话：“对不起，这回评奖我要告假了，今年太难评了。”
    这位评委是否当真会去“告假”，我不得而知，但“今年太难评了”，却是实情。刚刚给亿万电视观众留下深刻印象的《家教》、《绿荫》、《师魂》，都可能有希望夺奖，但能与它们竞争的电视连续剧也颇具实力，像名声很大的《末代皇帝》、根据名著改编的《家春秋》、名家执导的《那五》……这个候奖者名单还能往下开列，但“飞天奖”的获奖名额却很难往外膨胀。
    再如去年李保田以葛掌柜一角的成功塑造摘取了最佳男主角的桂冠，但今年他在《师魂》中的表演肯定是“更上一层楼”了。“飞天奖”的最佳演员得主是否也能像有些外国总统那样地连选连任呢？
    此外，别忘了一个细节：去年“飞天奖”揭晓后，曾引来见诸报端的不少非议。评委诸公第一次尝到了“舆论监督”的滋味后，心里不免嘀咕：“为什么当‘飞天奖’评委就这么吃力不讨好？”
    但是，从另外一个角度看，评选“飞天奖”过程中的“难”事很容易转化为“好”事的。
      “今年太难评了！”是因为今年旗鼓相当的竞选剧目比往年多，这正好说明我们的电视剧艺术有了提高。
    不管最佳男主角的评选结果如何，人们将会记住，正是我们的电视屏幕，给像李保田这样的卓越演员提供了不断展现才华的天地。
    至于“舆论监督”，实在是件大好事。如果说，“舆论监督”能督促政府官员廉政，那么“舆论监督”也能督促评委公正。
    但文艺竞赛不像体育比赛，它的可比性是相对的。这才是“飞天奖”（包括奥斯卡奖在内的一切影视评奖）的无法克服的难题。但也因为有此一“难”，才更加要求评委们的于心无愧的公正，才更加引起有关各方对评奖结果焦灼期待。
