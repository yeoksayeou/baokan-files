Bush Decides Government to Directly Handle Oil Spill Cleanup

		People's Daily, Washington, April 7 (Reported by Cang Lide) President Bush decided today that the federal government will replace Exxon Oil Company to directly handle the cleanup of the oil spill in Prince William Sound, Alaska, in order to fully restore the ecological environment and economy there.

		Secretary of Defense Cheney stated that the federal military will participate in this work. The military may establish command platforms on the oil-polluted sea surface, dispatch amphibious ships for the rest of the cleanup personnel, expand the transportation capacity near Valdez Port, and continue to provide oil cleanup equipment. Air traffic control experts have arrived at Valdez Airport to ensure 24-hour flights.

		Transportation Secretary Skinner, who is in charge of coordinating the cleanup work, said that the government is negotiating with Exxon Company to provide low-interest or interest-free loans for the disaster area and to raise a special fund for long-term use.

		Senate Democratic Leader Mitchell and other government officials criticized the White House today for underestimating the severity of this disaster, resulting in the loss of valuable time. Bush acknowledged that the White House currently does not have a sufficient emergency plan to deal with such disasters and has ordered an immediate nationwide review.

　　布什总统决定
    政府直接处理浮油清理工作
    本报华盛顿４月７日电  记者仓立德报道：布什总统今天决定，由联邦政府取代埃克森石油公司，直接负责阿拉斯加州威廉太子湾的浮油清理工作，以便使那里的生态环境和经济得到完全恢复。
    国防部长切尼表示，联邦军队将参与这项工作。军队可能在漏油污染海面设立指挥平台，派遣两栖军舰供清理人员歇息并扩大瓦尔德兹港附近的运输能力，并继续提供清油设备。空中交通控制专家已抵瓦尔德兹机场，以保证昼夜通航。
    负责协调清理工作的运输部长斯金纳说，政府正在与埃克森公司协商，为灾区提供低息或无息贷款，并筹集一笔供长期使用的专门基金。
    国会参议院民主党领袖米切尔及其他一些政府官员今天批评白宫对这场灾难的严重性估计不足，以致丧失了宝贵时间。布什承认白宫目前没有应付此类灾害的充分的应急计划，他已命令立即进行一次全国性审查。
