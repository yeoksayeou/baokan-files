	Adaptation and Guidance in Publishing
	Bi Sheng

	This early spring, I obtained a few magazines. First was Nanjing's "Dongfang Ji Shi" (Eastern Affairs), followed by Beijing's "Huaren Shijie" (Chinese World). After reading them, I felt quite refreshed and had some thoughts.

	Both magazines underwent reforms from their previous versions, increasing their content and adding new columns. Both magazines have two editions: "Dongfang Ji Shi" has a paperback and a hardcover version, while "Huaren Shijie" has a mainland edition and an overseas edition. Their reforms seem to have been coordinated.

	I can't speculate on the editorial department's original intentions for the reforms, but from the actual effects of the reforms, it's clear that change brings vitality, and reform brings benefits. I recall that in the past, "Dongfang Ji Shi" primarily published realistic literature and had some influential articles and unique columns (such as "Contemporary Confessions"). However, amidst the fluctuating tide of realistic literature, the editorial department timely shifted direction, bravely retreating from the current, and turned it into a comprehensive cultural magazine, focusing on reflecting and discussing social and cultural phenomena. Similarly, "Huaren Shijie" originally focused on publishing works by overseas Chinese writers, but after the reform, it maintained its original content while adding articles and works on domestic political, economic, and cultural issues.

	Both magazines have their unique focuses, but their publishing goals seem to converge—timely adjustments and adapting to the current reading interests of the general public, which is the trend towards cultural integration. If a few years ago, readers of literary magazines, due to the reading famine caused by the Cultural Revolution, were passively facing the dazzling array of literature, then after a decade of literary development in the new era, readers' horizons have widened, and their selection consciousness has strengthened. Some people have therefore suggested that the relationship between new era literature and readers has shifted from literature choosing readers to readers choosing literature. This statement, though not entirely comprehensive, points out the autonomy and selectivity of today's readers. One important reason is that contemporary readers' appreciation levels are gradually improving, and their reading interests are tending towards integration, academic, and cultural. For example, reading literary works is no longer just about understanding life and expressing emotions; it's also about recognizing history and life. Reading magazines is no longer just about entertainment; readers also hope to understand and recognize various contemporary social issues, such as the current state of contemporary social life, economy, and culture. Therefore, reading comprehensive cultural magazines has gradually become a need for some readers. Despite the high prices of the two magazines after the reform, they can still sell tens of thousands of copies.

	The magazines' "reforms" are reader-oriented, treating readers as kings. In terms of readers' interests, magazines should both adapt and guide. The former is the basis for the magazines' survival, while the latter is the hallmark of the magazines' brand. By guiding, I don't mean passive preaching, but rather cultivating general readers' interests to adapt to the elite level of cultural standards of a certain period. Just looking at the proliferation of vulgar and lowbrow street literature is enough to feel the necessity of this work. As a medium for cultural consumption, magazines should also bear the responsibility of raising the cultural level of the masses. Of course, this doesn't mean that all magazines should be comprehensive and high-level. The cultural characteristic of the present age is the coexistence of elite culture and mass culture. Readers' aesthetic requirements and cultural modernization have presented new challenges to magazines. The emergence of these two magazines is undoubtedly welcomed, and from this, can't we also see the conscience of intellectuals?

　　改刊：适应和引导
　　毕胜
    今年初春得到几本刊物。先是南京的《东方纪事》，后是北京出版的《华人世界》。读后颇感解渴，也生发出一点联想。
    这两本刊物，都是在过去“旧版本”上的改革，增加了篇幅，增设了栏目，增添了内容。两本刊物都出两个版本：《东方纪事》分简装和精装，《华人世界》有大陆版和海外版。“改革变法”不谋而合。
    不敢妄测编辑部改刊的初衷，但从改刊后的实际效果看，变则活，改则有益。记得过去《东》是以刊发纪实文学为主，也发过一些有影响的文章和开办了有特色的栏目（比如《当代人自白》）。可是，在逐浪沉浮的纪实文学热潮中，编辑部及时转向，急“流”勇退，办成综合性的文化刊物，集中反映社会文化现象，研讨社会文化问题。同样，《华》原是以发表海外华人作家作品为主的纯文学刊物，改刊后保持了原来内容的同时，增加了关于国内政治、经济和文化问题的论文和作品。
    两本刊物各有侧重，但其办刊宗旨似又殊途同归——及时调整并适应当前读者大众的阅读兴趣，即文化的综合化趋势。如果说前几年文学刊物的读者由于“文革”造成的阅读饥荒，面对乱花迷眼的文学，读者的阅读是被动的，那么经过新时期十年的文学发展，读者的眼界扩大了，选择意识增强了。有人就此认为新时期文学与读者的关系，由文学选择读者转向读者选择文学。此言虽不太全面，但指出了当今读者大众阅读的自主性和选择性。其中一个重要原因是当代读者的欣赏水平逐渐提高，阅读兴趣趋向于综合性、学术化和文化化。比如，读文学作品已不满足于认识生活，寄托情感，还要从中认识历史和人生；读刊物不满足于消遣，而对当代种种社会问题，诸如当代社会生活、经济、文化的现状等等，都希望能有所了解，有所认识。因而读综合性的文化类刊物，渐渐成为一部分读者的需要。尽管改刊后的两刊售价不低，也能行销数万册。
    刊物的“变法”是面向读者，视读者为上帝。就读者阅读兴趣来说，刊物既要适应，也要引导。前者是刊物生存之本，后者是刊物创牌子的标志。所谓引导不是被动地说教，而是将一般读者的阅读兴趣培养适应到一个时期文化水准的精英层次。只要看看那些庸俗低级的地摊文学泛滥就足以感到这项工作的必要性。刊物作为文化消费的媒体，也应该承担提高群众文化水平的职责。当然，不是说刊物都要综合化、高层次化。现时代的文化特点是精英文化与大众文化相生共存。读者的审美要求和文化现代化已经向刊物提出了新课题，应运而生的这两个刊物受到欢迎是无疑的，从中不也可以看到知识分子的良知吗？
