Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 12th.

Premier Li Peng today delivered a speech at the welcome banquet hosted by Prime Minister Takeshita. The detailed summary of his speech is as follows:

In this spring season with blooming cherry blossoms, my wife and I, at the invitation of the Japanese government, have come to your country for an official friendly visit. Tonight, we are honored to attend the grand banquet hosted by Prime Minister Takeshita and his wife, which provides us with an opportunity to gather with people from all walks of life in your country and exchange sentiments of friendship. I would also like to take this opportunity to express, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, our highest respect and warm greetings to the Japanese people and to all our old and new friends in Japan who are dedicated to promoting Sino-Japanese friendship.

The normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan has been in place for seventeen years. Through the joint efforts of the governments and peoples of both countries, Sino-Japanese friendship and cooperation have made significant progress in various fields, bringing important benefits to both sides and making positive contributions to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. Since Prime Minister Takeshita took office, he has attached great importance to the development of Japan-China relations and has done a lot of beneficial work to further promote mutual beneficial cooperation between the two countries. Prime Minister Takeshita's important visit to our country last August has contributed to the overall stable and good development of bilateral relations.

The current state of Sino-Japanese friendly neighborly relations is indeed hard-won. It embodies the efforts of the predecessors of both countries and the long-term efforts of friends from all walks of life present here. We should cherish it even more. Developing long-term stable Sino-Japanese friendly neighborly relations and mutual beneficial cooperation is a consistent policy of the Chinese government. We are willing to work with friends from all walks of life in Japan to, on the basis of the Sino-Japanese Joint Communiqué, the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and China, and the four principles of Sino-Japanese relations, explore and promote all positive factors that contribute to the development of bilateral relations, and curb and overcome all negative factors that are not conducive to Sino-Japanese friendship, so as to promote the healthy and smooth development of bilateral relations.

Currently, the international situation has seen encouraging positive changes, with a shift from confrontation to dialogue and from tension to relaxation, becoming a global trend. However, the various factors that cause international tension and turmoil have not been eliminated. Achieving lasting world peace still requires the unremitting efforts of the peoples of all countries. China and Japan are both important countries in the Asia-Pacific region. We have an important responsibility to maintain peace in this region and even the world, and to promote common development. We should make our respective contributions. China is committed to the peace and development of the Asia-Pacific region and the world, and believes that Japan, as a highly developed economic country, if it can correctly use its own advantages, contribute to the peace and development of Asia and the world, will certainly be widely welcomed by the international community.

China adheres to the policy of reform and opening up and is striving to achieve national modernization. We need an international environment of peace and stability even more. China will unswervingly pursue an independent and peaceful foreign policy, and develop friendly and cooperative relations with all countries, especially neighboring countries in Asia, on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

The upcoming high-level meeting between China and the Soviet Union in Beijing has attracted wide attention from the international community. I would like to tell everyone here that the normalization of state-to-state relations between China and the Soviet Union on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence is not only in the interest of the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, but also conducive to peace and stability in Asia and even the world, and will not affect or damage the interests of any third country, including Japan.

This afternoon, I had an in-depth and extensive exchange of views with Prime Minister Takeshita on bilateral relations and international issues of common concern in a friendly and sincere atmosphere. Both sides were satisfied. It is gratifying that I will also have the opportunity to have extensive contact with people from all walks of life in your country and to learn firsthand about the new achievements your country has made in the fields of economy and technology in recent years. I believe that, with the enthusiastic and thoughtful arrangements of the hosts, this visit will certainly be a complete success.

　　克服消极因素推动两国关系
    本报东京4月12日电　李鹏总理今天在竹下登首相举行的欢迎宴会上发表讲话，详细摘要如下：
    在春光明媚、樱花盛开的时节，我和我的夫人应日本政府的邀请，来到贵国进行正式友好访问。今晚，承蒙首相阁下和夫人举行隆重的宴会，使我们有机会和贵国朝野各界人士共聚一堂，畅叙友谊，感到十分高兴。我还愿借此机会代表中国政府和人民向日本国民以及一切热心于中日友好事业的日本新老朋友致以崇高的敬意和亲切的问候。
    中日邦交正常化已经历了十七个年头。在两国政府和人民的共同努力下，中日友好合作在广泛领域里取得了显著进展，不仅给我们双方带来了重要利益，也为亚洲地区的和平与稳定作出了积极贡献。竹下登先生就任首相以来，重视发展日中关系，为进一步增进两国互利合作做了许多有益工作。首相阁下于去年8月对我国的重要访问，使两国关系在总的方面得到了平稳而良好的发展。
    中日睦邻友好能有今天的局面，确实来之不易，它凝聚着两国先辈们为之奋斗的心血，也是包括在座的各界朋友多年来努力的结果，我们理应倍加珍惜。发展长期稳定的中日睦邻友好和互利合作，是中国政府的一贯政策。我们愿意和日本朝野各界朋友一道，在中日联合声明、中日和平友好条约以及中日关系四原则的基础上，发掘并弘扬一切有助于两国关系发展的积极因素，抑制并克服不利于中日友好的消极因素，推动两国关系继续健康、顺畅地向前发展。
    当前国际形势出现了令人可喜的积极变化，从对抗转向对话，从紧张转向缓和，正在成为世界性潮流。但是，导致国际形势紧张、动荡的各种因素并未消除，实现世界持久和平，仍需各国人民坚持不懈的努力。中日两国都是亚太地区的重要国家，对维护这一地区以至世界和平，以促进共同发展，负有重要的责任，应当做出我们各自的贡献。中国愿意致力于亚太地区与世界的和平与发展，并相信日本作为经济高度发达的国家，如能正确运用自己的优势，奉献于亚洲和世界的和平与发展，必将受到国际社会的普遍欢迎。
    中国遵循改革、开放的总方针，为实现国家的现代化正在努力奋斗，更需要一个和平与稳定的国际环境。中国将坚定不移地奉行独立自主的和平外交政策，同世界各国特别是亚洲近邻国家，在和平共处五项原则基础上发展友好合作关系。
    即将在北京举行的中苏高级会晤，受到了国际社会广泛瞩目。我愿在此告诉各位，中苏两国在和平共处五项原则的基础上实现国家关系的正常化，这不仅符合中苏两国人民的利益，而且有利于亚洲乃至世界的和平与稳定，而不会影响或损害包括日本在内的任何第三国的利益。
    今天下午，我同首相阁下在友好诚挚的气氛中就双边关系和共同关心的国际问题深入、广泛地交换了意见，双方都感到满意。令人高兴的是，我还将有机会同贵国各界人士进行广泛接触，实地了解贵国近年来在经济、科技方面取得的新成就。我相信，在主人的热情周到的安排下，这次访问一定能够取得圆满成功。
