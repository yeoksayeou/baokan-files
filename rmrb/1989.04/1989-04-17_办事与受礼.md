Everyone says it's hard to get things done, and often, without sending gifts or money, things can't get done. Regarding the staff of law enforcement departments, public service departments, and departments that manage people and resources, the public categorizes them into four types: the first type is those who do not accept gifts but are diligent in their work; the second type is those who accept gifts and do their work; the third type is those who neither accept gifts nor do their work; the fourth type is those who accept gifts but do not do their work. The public most welcomes the first type, followed by the second type; the public hates the fourth type the most, followed by the third type.

The first type are honest and upright, and it is natural that they are welcomed; the fourth type are like "a meat bun thrown at a dog—it goes in but never comes out," and they don't even wag their tails for those who throw the meat buns, so they are extremely despised; the third type are like clay idols that do not show any signs even when offered incense and candles, they are bureaucrats who are clean but do nothing, so it is understandable that the public does not welcome them. The strange thing is the second type, why does the public still rank them above the third type?

It seems strange but it is not. To get things done, everyone is afraid of delays and mistakes, and would rather bear the pain of sending gifts and money to get things done quickly, so they are dissatisfied with those who do not accept gifts but also do not do their work, and place them behind those who accept gifts and do their work. This is not because everyone likes those who accept gifts, but in choosing between a fish and a bear's paw, they have to choose the lesser of two evils to get things done.

It is particularly worth noting the second type of people: those who accept gifts and do their work. This is an exchange of power for money. Such people and such phenomena are extremely dangerous: first, currently, there are more of these people compared to the third and fourth types, their influence is bad, although they do their work, they are different from honest and upright people, they do not follow principles or policies when doing their work, they do things that should not be done if gifts are given or if more gifts are given; they do not do things that should be done if no gifts are given or if fewer gifts are given. Second, such people are not easily exposed because they do things for the public (in reality, they are seeking personal gain), and the public does not dare to expose them, fearing that it will block their path to getting things done in the future. Third, such people also have a reserve force, which is the fourth type of people. The fourth type of people accept gifts but do not do their work, and the people sending gifts will not keep giving them, and they will eventually expose them, so they will not last long and will not be able to "get more and gain more." Such people also have to do some work, gradually moving towards the second type.

The construction of a clean government system is mainly to solve the problem of the second type of people, using the system to prevent the exchange of power and money, and to increase the number of honest and upright people. Of course, the kind of people who are clean but also do not do their work, bureaucratism, is also to be eliminated, this is also a kind of corruption, political corruption. We need to make public service and public supervision institutionalized and regular, to awaken the public's sense of being the main force, to rely on the rule of law and democracy to overcome corruption, to prevent it beforehand, to supervise it in the middle, and to punish it afterwards, to return those who act like masters to the position of "public servants," so that they can do a good job for the public and serve the people.

　　办事与受礼
　　李淳
    人人都说办事难，不送礼送钱常常办不成事。对于执法部门、公共事业服务部门、掌管人财物的部门的办事人员，群众分为４种：第一种是不受礼而热心办事的；第二种是受了礼办事的；第三种是既不受礼也不办事的；第四种是受了礼也不办事的。群众最欢迎的是第一种，第二种次之；最恨的是第四种，第三种次之。
    第一种是廉洁奉公的，受欢迎理所当然；第四种是“肉包子打狗——有去无回”，对扔肉包子的连尾巴也不摇一下，当然可恶之极；第三种是既不受供献香火也不显灵的泥胎木偶，是两袖清风的官僚主义者，群众不欢迎也可以理解。奇怪的是第二种，为什么群众还把他们排在第三种人的前头？
    似怪不怪。要办事，谁都怕拖、怕误事，宁肯忍痛送礼送钱快点办成事，所以才对虽不受礼又不办事者不满，把他们放在既受礼也办事者之后。这并非大家喜欢受礼者，在鱼与熊掌之间选择，为了办事不得已而求其次。
    值得特别注意的是这第二种人：既受礼又办事。这是用权力同金钱相交换。这种人、这种现象极危险：一是眼下这种人为数比第三、四种人多，作用大，影响坏，他们虽也办事，但与廉洁奉公者不同，办事不讲原则，不顾政策，有礼和礼多的，不该办的也办；无礼或礼少的，该办的也不办。二是这种人不易被揭露，因为他给群众办了事（实际是为自己谋私），群众不好意思曝他的光，也怕堵了以后办事的路。三是这种人还有一支预备队，这就是第四种人。第四种人受礼不办事，送礼人不会一直给他送，而且终究会揭他的底，既不会长久，也难以“多捞多得”。这种人也不得不办一点事，从而逐渐向第二种人靠拢。
    廉政制度建设，最主要的就是要解决第二种人的问题，用制度防止权与钱的交换，让廉洁奉公的人多起来。当然，那种虽然清白但也不办事的官僚主义也在扫除之列，这也是一种腐败，政治上的腐败。要把公开办事和群众监督制度化、经常化，唤起群众主体意识的觉醒，依靠法制和民主来战胜腐败，做到既防范于前，又监督于中，复惩戒于后，把那些作威作福的“主人”还原到“人民公仆”的地位，使他们好好地为群众办事，为人民服务。
