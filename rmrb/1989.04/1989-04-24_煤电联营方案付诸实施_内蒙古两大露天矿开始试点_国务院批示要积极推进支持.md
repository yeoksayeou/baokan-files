	Coal-Electricity Joint Operation Plan Implemented
	Inner Mongolia's Two Large Open-Pit Mines Begin Pilot Projects
	State Council Directs Active Promotion and Support

	XINHUA News Agency reports: Reporter Liu Xiaoyang reports: The coal-electricity joint operation work at Inner Mongolia's two large open-pit coal mines, Yimin River and Yuanbaoshan, has begun. The planning and design cooperation group for Yimin River, composed of the Northeast Inner Mongolia Coal Industry Corporation and the Northeast Power Corporation, was established in February this year and is now fully planning the coal-electricity joint operation work. The Yuanbaoshan cooperation group is about to be established.

	The coal-electricity joint operation of these two large open-pit coal mines is part of the State Council-approved plan by the Ministry of Energy to promote coal-electricity joint operations. The State Council's directive points out: Promoting coal-electricity joint operations, especially for the development and utilization of low-heat-value coal through joint operations, has significant economic benefits and is in line with the direction of reform. It should be actively promoted and supported.

	Relevant officials pointed out that implementing coal-electricity joint operations has the following advantages:

	--- Implementing coal-electricity joint operations can unify the planning and design of coal and electricity, build power plants and coal mines together, avoid long-distance coal transportation; can save land, reduce pollution; public facilities and living welfare facilities can be built and used together, avoiding duplication. It is estimated that implementing coal-electricity joint operations can save 5% to 10% of investment compared to coal and electricity operating separately, and a 100 million kilowatt power generation capacity can save 1 to 2 billion yuan.

	--- It is beneficial to reduce operating costs. Due to the savings in investment, the corresponding reduction in depreciation and major repair costs, plus the reduction in intermediate links and management levels, saving personnel, the operating cost can generally be reduced by about 10%.

	--- It is beneficial to strengthen production and operation management.

	Both Yimin River and Yuanbaoshan coal mines have abundant coal resources and relatively sufficient water sources for power plants, and the distance between coal mines and power plants is relatively close, with natural good conditions for coal-electricity joint operations. The State Council requires these two open-pit coal mines to do a good job in the coal-electricity joint operation pilot projects.

	The Ministry of Energy proposes that the implementation of coal-electricity joint operations should be differentiated, classified and guided, combined with points and surfaces, and gradually promoted.

　　煤电联营方案付诸实施    
    内蒙古两大露天矿开始试点    
    国务院批示要积极推进支持
    本报讯  记者刘燮阳报道：我国内蒙古伊敏河、元宝山两大露天煤矿的煤电联营工作已经开始。由东北内蒙古煤炭工业联合公司和东北电力公司组成的伊敏河规划设计协作小组早在今年２月成立，正在全面规划伊敏河煤电联营工作，元宝山协作小组即将成立。
    这两大露天煤矿的煤电联营是国务院批准的能源部《关于推行煤电联营的方案》的一个组成部分。国务院批示中指出：推行煤电联营，特别是对低热值煤炭的开发利用实行联营，经济效益是显著的，也是符合改革方向的，应积极推进和支持。
    有关人士指出，实行煤电联营有以下好处：
    ——实行煤电联营，可以对煤炭、电力统一规划，统一设计，使电厂和煤矿建在一起，避免煤炭的远距离运输；可以少占土地，减少污染；公用设施及生活福利设施等可以统一建设，共同使用，避免重复。据测算，实行煤电联营，比煤电各搞各的可节省５％—１０％的投资，１００万千瓦发电能力可节省到１到２亿元。
    ——有利于降低运营成本。由于投资节省，相应减少了成本中的折旧费和大修理费，加上减少了中间环节和管理层次，节省了人员，运营成本一般可降低１０％左右。
    ——有利于加强生产经营管理。
    伊敏河、元宝山两煤矿都具有丰富的煤炭资源和比较充足的可供电厂使用的水源，煤矿与电厂的距离比较近，具有天然良好的煤电联营条件。国务院要求这两个露天煤矿要搞好煤电联营试点。
    能源部提出，实行煤电联营，应当区别情况，分类指导，点面结合，逐步推开。
