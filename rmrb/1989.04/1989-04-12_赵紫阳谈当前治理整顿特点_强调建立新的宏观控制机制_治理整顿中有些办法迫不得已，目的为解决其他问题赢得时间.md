Zhao Ziyang Discusses the Characteristics of the Current Rectification and Adjustment
Emphasizes the Establishment of a New Macroeconomic Control Mechanism
Some Measures in Rectification and Adjustment Are Necessary, Aiming to Solve Other Problems and Gain Time

New China News Agency, Beijing, April 11 (Reporter Wu Shishen) — Today, in the Huairen Hall of Zhongnanhai, CCP Central Committee General Secretary Zhao Ziyang held a discussion with representatives attending the National Conference on Enterprise Contract Responsibility System. He said that the current rectification and adjustment, compared to previous economic adjustments, has different characteristics. Recognizing and grasping these characteristics is crucial for successfully carrying out the rectification and adjustment to achieve the expected goals.

Zhao Ziyang said that this rectification and adjustment is taking place during the reform process, that is, during the transition between the old and new systems and the existence of a dual-track pricing system. This situation significantly increases the complexity and difficulty of the rectification and adjustment, and thus poses new and higher demands on our work. Some effective methods used in previous adjustments are now difficult to implement because we have liberalized a large part of the economy over the past few years. The liberalized part is hard to control with old methods. However, we cannot revert the already liberalized economy to a state of stagnation. On the contrary, this rectification and adjustment should consolidate the achievements of the reform and create conditions for further reform. Therefore, we must actively seek new methods that can solve the problems of rectification and adjustment, benefit the reform, and at least not add difficulties to future reforms. Some measures taken during the rectification and adjustment may seem like a retreat, but this is a necessary evil, aimed at gaining time to solve other problems and is a temporary price to pay. We must be aware of this and actively create conditions to gradually replace these measures with new ones. Adapting to the new situation of socialist commodity economy with planning, and establishing a new macroeconomic control mechanism, is a major new task before us. Whether this task can be solved well is related to the ultimate success or failure of the rectification and adjustment.

Zhao Ziyang said that this rectification and adjustment is also taking place under the condition of opening up to the outside world, which is advantageous for us. China has abundant labor force and relatively low costs; we have established a considerable industrial base, including strong industrial processing capabilities in military enterprises; we have a considerable scientific and technological force. These are our favorable conditions for participating in international economic cooperation and exchange. The current international situation is trending towards easing, and the trend of international economic exchange and cooperation is developing, which is a good opportunity. Under the condition of opening up to the outside world, we do not need to completely balance the "short line" within the country, but can overcome difficulties and promote development through international exchange, which is different from the closed condition. Not only the coastal areas, but the whole country is like this. The development over the past ten years has proven this. Especially in recent years, China's external economic cooperation and exchange have developed significantly, with rapid growth in exports and a favorable change in export structure, which seems to have great potential. When studying the development strategy, we should fully consider how to utilize the conditions of opening up to the outside world. We have our own advantages to play. Therefore, there is no reason to be pessimistic about the prospects of China's economic development. The key is that we should stand higher, look further, persist in reform and opening up, consciously seize the favorable opportunities, do a good job, and promote the rectification and adjustment and the overall modernization construction.

Zhao Ziyang said that since the Third Plenum of the 13th Central Committee, the rectification and adjustment has achieved initial results and must be carried out resolutely without wavering. He also particularly emphasized that during the rectification and adjustment, we must focus on deepening enterprise reform. We must adhere to and improve the contract responsibility system. On the basis of the contract responsibility system, we must vigorously strengthen scientific management. He said that on the one hand, we must seriously implement the "Enterprise Law" and further implement enterprise autonomy; on the other hand, enterprises must use the power given by the state to tap internal potential, improve economic efficiency, and contribute more to the state.

Those who attended today's discussion included leaders from relevant state departments, provincial, autonomous region, and municipal planning commissions, and economic commissions, as well as some enterprise managers, totaling more than 70 people. Ten representatives spoke on the topics of improving the contract responsibility system, tapping potential and saving, enterprise mergers, and optimizing combinations. They believed that overcoming difficulties depends on the contract responsibility system, and the more difficult it is, the more we should adhere to the contract responsibility system, which is the correct choice at present. During the representatives' speeches, Zhao Ziyang often asked questions and interjected.

When the representative from Jilin mentioned that they implemented the enterprise contract responsibility system, and the efficiency significantly improved, with slower growth in consumption funds, Zhao Ziyang said that the contract responsibility system has not completely solved the problem of consumption fund expansion, but it is also unfounded to say that the contract responsibility system has exacerbated the consumption fund expansion. He said that to make enterprises both profitable and loss-making, there is indeed a mechanism problem here, but also a problem of local government's determination. The experience of some places has proven that as long as they are determined to fulfill the contract, enterprises can indeed be both profitable and loss-making.

State Councilors Li Tieming, Wang Neiqian, Zhou Jiaxuan, and Li Guixian also attended the discussion.

　　赵紫阳谈当前治理整顿特点
　　强调建立新的宏观控制机制
　　治理整顿中有些办法迫不得已，目的为解决其他问题赢得时间
    新华社北京４月１１日电　（记者吴士深）中共中央总书记赵紫阳今天在中南海怀仁堂同出席全国企业承包经营责任制座谈会的代表座谈时说，当前的治理整顿与历次经济调整相比，有不同的特点，认识和把握这些特点，才能把治理整顿搞好，达到预期目的。
    赵紫阳说，这次治理整顿是在改革的过程中间，也就是说，是在新旧体制交替、价格存在双轨制这样一个情况下进行的。这种情况大大增加了治理整顿的复杂性和难度，对我们的工作也就提出了新的、更高的要求。过去进行调整所采用过的一些很有效的办法，现在有些已很难奏效，因为我们这几年把经济放活了一大块。对放活的那一块，用老办法难以控制。但是，我们也不能再把已经搞活的经济重新搞死。恰恰相反，这次治理整顿，应该巩固改革的成果，并为进一步改革创造条件。因此，我们必须积极地寻找既能解决治理整顿的问题，又有利于改革，至少不为今后改革增加困难的新办法。在治理整顿中采取的办法，有的看起来好像是后退，但这属于不得已而为之，是为了给其他问题的解决赢得时间，是暂时要付出的一种代价。对此我们要心中有数，并积极地创造条件，逐渐地以新的办法来代替它。适应社会主义有计划商品经济的新情况，建立新的宏观控制机制，是摆在我们面前的重大的新课题。这个课题能否解决好，关系到治理整顿的最终成败。
    赵紫阳说，这次治理整顿又是在对外开放的条件下进行的，这一点对我们有利。我国劳动力充足，而且费用较低；我们已经建立起相当规模的工业基础，包括军工企业在内的工业加工能力较强；我们有相当大的科技力量。这些是我们参加国际经济合作与交流的有利条件。当前国际形势趋向缓和，国际经济交流与合作的趋势在发展，这是一个好机遇。在对外开放的条件下，我们不必完全按照“短线”在国内求平衡，而可以通过国际交换克服困难，促进发展，这和在封闭条件下不同。不仅沿海，全国都是这样。过去十年来的发展，已经证明了这一点。尤其是最近几年，我国对外经济合作与交流有很大发展，出口增长快，出口结构也发生了可喜的变化，看来大有可为。在研究发展战略时，应当充分考虑如何利用对外开放的条件。我们有自己的优势可以发挥。所以，对中国经济发展的前景没有理由悲观。重要的是，我们要站得高一点，看得远一点，坚持改革、开放，自觉地抓住有利时机，做好工作，推动治理整顿和整个四化建设。
    赵紫阳说，十三届三中全会以来，治理整顿已取得初步成效，一定要坚定不移地进行下去，不能半途而废。他还特别强调，在治理整顿中，必须重点抓好深化企业改革。要坚持和完善承包制。在承包制的基础上，大力加强科学管理。他说，现在一方面要认真贯彻《企业法》，进一步落实企业自主权；另一方面，企业要运用国家给的权力，下功夫挖掘内部潜力，提高经济效益，为国家多作贡献。
    参加今天座谈会的有国家有关部门、各省、自治区、直辖市和计划单列市体改委、计经委负责人，以及部分企业厂长、经理共７０多人。１０位代表就完善承包制、挖潜节约、企业兼并和优化组合等问题发了言。他们认为，克服困难要靠承包制，越困难越要坚持承包，这是当前的正确选择。在代表们发言时，赵紫阳不时提问、插话。
    当吉林代表谈到他们推行企业承包制，效益明显提高，消费基金增长较慢时，赵紫阳说，承包制还没有完全解决消费基金膨胀的问题，但是如果说承包制助长了消费基金膨胀，也是没有根据的。他说，要使企业既能负盈又能负亏，这里固然有机制问题，但也有当地政府的决心问题。一些地方的经验证明，只要下决心兑现承包合同，是可以使企业既负盈又负亏的。
    国务委员李铁映、王内乾、邹家华、李贵鲜也出席了座谈会。
