Title: Two "Strange Incidents" in Shaanxi Education

	"We made the biggest mistake in education over the past 10 years by not developing it enough." This statement is absolutely true. Consider the two astonishing incidents that have occurred in Shaanxi, which harm education and delay the progress of the next generation, truly shocking.

	"Strange Incident" One:

	On December 2, 1988, the Party branch secretary of Yangping Town, Yaodibao Village, Baoji County, Shaanxi Province, Jia Xianmao, held a grand banquet for his eldest daughter's wedding. The family needed tables and chairs, so they made a whole class of fifth-grade students in the village school stop classes for a day. Coincidentally, on January 7 this year, the village committee director, Zhang Zhimin, borrowed chairs from the kindergarten for his son's wedding, also forcing dozens of children to stop classes for a day.

	What is baffling is that when they held weddings at home, they thought of using the school, but they showed little interest in raising the salaries of the contracted teachers. It is understood that in recent years, the village secretary and the village committee director each received an annual subsidy and bonus of around 3,000 yuan, but the village was slow to raise the "wages" of 55 yuan per month for each contracted teacher. Principal Hou Laifu complained to the reporter that from September 1987 to February 1988, the entire semester, the village did not give the contracted teachers a single cent. The principal himself is also a contracted teacher. Seeing that the winter vacation was approaching and the New Year was near, he used the 600 yuan he had saved from selling grain to pay the three contracted teachers he had recruited from another village.

	"Strange Incident" Two:

	More than 20,000 words of vulgar descriptions centered around prostitution and debauchery were somehow included in the sixth-grade primary school textbook "Language" Volume 10, which was printed and distributed this spring by the Shaanxi Provincial Printing Plant.

	It is absurd that the Shaanxi Provincial Printing Plant would print and bind such content into primary school textbooks. Upon investigation, the text with obscene descriptions totaled 32 pages, although it was disjointed, the content was coherent. It inserted pages 27 to 58 of the book "Thoughts Under the Sun - The Yellow Ghost in the Dark Corners of Yangcheng" into the fifth-grade "Language" textbook. This batch of language textbooks had a print run of over 580,000 copies and were distributed throughout the province. How many were incorrectly bound, which link in the production process went wrong, and whose responsibility it was, the factory leaders could not explain at the time.

	These two "exposed" incidents are worth serious consideration.

### 陕西教育两“奇闻”

　　陕西教育两“奇闻”
    本报记者  景险峰
    “我们在１０年中最大的失误是在教育方面发展不够”。此话一点不假。请看发生在陕西的两则危害教育、贻误下一代的“奇闻”，实在令人吃惊。
    “奇闻”之一：
    １９８８年１２月２日，陕西省宝鸡县阳平镇窑底村党支部书记贾贤茂大闺女出嫁，家里大摆宴席需要桌凳，竟让本村小学５年级一个班的学生停课一天。无独有偶，今年１月７日，这个村村民委员会主任张志明给大儿子办婚事，借用学前班的凳子，也逼使几十名儿童停课一天。
    令人不解的是，自己家里办婚事使他们想到了“学校的用场”，可对筹集民办教师的工资他们兴趣不大。据了解，近几年该村书记和村委会主任等每人每年拿补贴和奖金都在３０００元左右，可民办教师每人每月５５元的“工钱”，村里迟迟筹集不起来。校长侯来福对记者诉苦说，村小１９８７年９月至１９８８年２月，整整一个学期，村里没给民办教师一分钱。校长本人也是民办教师，眼看放寒假后快过年了，他把自家卖粮存留的６００元钱，垫付给从外村招聘来的３名民办教师。
    “奇闻”之二：
    ２．１万多字以卖淫嫖娼为主题的低俗描写，竟被承印教材的陕西省印刷厂硬给“塞进”了今年春季发行的六年制小学课本《语文》第十册里。
    堂堂陕西省印刷厂，印刷装订如此内容的小学教材，真是荒唐透顶。经查证，被“塞进”教材中有关色情描写的文字共有３２页，没头没尾，但内容连贯。它将《阳光下的思考——羊城暗角的黄色幽灵》一书的第２７页至第５８页，张冠李戴，装订到小学５年级《语文》课本里。这批语文课本印数为５８万多册，全省发行。到底装订错了多少，生产中哪个环节出了问题，什么人的责任，厂领导一时竟然说不清楚。
    “曝光”的这两则“奇闻”，值得我们认真地加以思考。
