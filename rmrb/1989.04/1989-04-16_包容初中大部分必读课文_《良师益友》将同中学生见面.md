Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 14th. (Reporter Zhang Yanping) A large-scale middle school textbook drama "Good Teachers, Good Friends," presented through various artistic forms such as makeup recitation, monodrama, dramatic sketches, and selected scenes from plays, will soon be available to middle school students nationwide.

The over 10-hour-long "Good Teachers, Good Friends" includes 60 programs (i.e., 60 essays), covering most of the essential texts in the middle school language curriculum. It features excerpts from historical literary classics such as "Dream of the Red Chamber," "Water Margin," and "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," as well as poems by Du Fu and Bai Juyi. It also includes masterpieces by literary giants such as Lu Xun, Zhu Ziqing, Lao She, Zheng Zhen, and Mao Dun, and representative works by modern famous writers such as Zhou Libo, Du Pengcheng, and Yang Xiao. Works by foreign authors such as Gorky's "The Seagull," Chekhov's "The Chameleon," and Daudet's "The Last Lesson" are also selected for the program.

The Beijing People's Art Theatre began the production of this textbook drama at the end of last year. The theater has assigned over 30 actors to participate in the filming, including renowned recitation artists and performers such as Zhou Zheng, Jin Naqian, and Cao Can, among other famous middle-aged and young actors.
