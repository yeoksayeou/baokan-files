	Adjustment: The Lever of Economic Development
	– A Record of Qiqihar's Struggle to Overcome Difficulties and Achieve Higher Efficiency in Industry

	People's Daily reporter Wǔ Péi Zhēn

	Editor's Note: Qiqihar's experience is worth noting, especially their proposal to make production factors flow and continuously optimize their combination, which is enlightening. The reason why Qiqihar can strongly promote the development of social productive forces is that it adheres to the law of value and social benefits, continuously realizing the flow and optimal combination of various production factors. Imagine, if China's current human, material, and financial resources can achieve this to a greater extent, how much waste can be reduced and how much wealth can be increased! Many comrades have not paid enough attention to this aspect.

	When the city of Qiqihar, with a population of one million, was struggling to advance with the tide of reform, it was burdened with 10 fiscally subsidized counties (only one county in the city was self-sufficient). For 21 years, the city's industrial output value increased by an average of 1.51% annually, far below the national average of 6.59% during the same period. Qiqihar's industrial and tax revenue accounted for 75% of fiscal revenue, 10% lower than the national average.

	Now, the tide of reform has passed, and Qiqihar has emerged at the crest of the wave. In 1988, the city's industrial output value increased by only 6.1% compared to the previous year, but tax revenue increased by 24.8%. Among them, the output value of local budgetary enterprises increased by 8.9%, and tax revenue increased by 32.3%. In other words, the efficiency is far higher than the national average. With less consumption, more output, and higher efficiency, the reform has created a relatively relaxed situation. Qiqihar has become a prominent reformer.

	Performing Surgery to Treat "Disproportionate Light and Heavy Industries"

	Before 1985, Qiqihar faced great difficulties, with one-third of the city's enterprises operating at a loss. The city had several large factories with tens of thousands of employees, and the city, known as the "Steel and Machinery City," was like a lame giant, with a heavy industry to light industry ratio of 7:3. One leg was so heavy it dragged in the mud, while the other was so light it seemed to step on clouds.

	When enterprises are not active, the economy struggles. How to revitalize enterprises?

	Qiqihar's reform started with adjusting the enterprise structure. The people here identified two key points: first, Qiqihar's industrial development had not fully utilized local resource advantages. The city is adjacent to the Daqing Oil Field but lacks a petrochemical industry; vast reed marshes provide ample resources for papermaking, but they have not been utilized; there are vast grasslands, but there is a lack of corresponding leather, fur, and food processing industries... It is clear that the traditional administrative economic management system has caused the regional economic structure to deviate from market demands, and the past economic structure was largely built according to administrative directives.

	Another important point is that the internal structure of the original industry was irrational. The large factories under the "vertical" system and local industries were isolated from each other, and small, self-sufficient "mini-societies" stood side by side, resulting in a large amount of duplicated construction and idle facilities.

	With this understanding, Qiqihar's leaders decided to focus on developing the petroleum chemical, pharmaceutical, building materials, papermaking, and plastics industries based on resource and production capacity advantages, while vigorously supporting raw material bases. Industrial processing centers emerged, replacing many enterprises' small, self-sufficient "sparrow projects," and enterprises began to form a comprehensive processing capability production system.

	Several years of adjustments have shown significant results. In 1988, the city's fiscal revenue increased by 64% compared to 1985, and the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" was completed two years ahead of schedule, exceeding the target by 6%.

	"Feed the Strong and Starve the Lazy"

	To accelerate product adjustments, the financial, material, and energy departments implemented a policy of "feeding the strong and starving the lazy" for enterprises. Products with low consumption, high added value, and those closely related to economic development and people's lives, with favorable conditions, were given priority support. Otherwise, they were subject to compression and restrictions.

	Over the past three years, the city has eliminated nearly 500 substandard products and developed more than 1,000 new products at an annual renewal rate of 40%. For every new product added in the city, approximately 100,000 yuan in new profits are generated.

	They knew that not everything could be rushed. Qiqihar particularly focused on the deep processing and comprehensive utilization of local resources. With flax resources here, they started by introducing improved varieties and then developed hemp products; they invested heavily to transform marshes into reed ponds and then established the paper processing industry; to make the green grasslands contribute more wealth, Qiqihar started from introducing improved cattle and sheep to developing dairy products and leather products, building a "15-dragon" product series.

	Adjusting the industrial structure has brought sweet results.

	Let Production Factors Flow to High-Efficiency Areas

	To develop production, who doesn't face a shortage of funds? The potential for expanding reproduction through increased investment is limited. The Qiqihar Municipal Party Committee and government believe that fundamentally, efficiency must be improved through tapping internal potential.

	People, funds, materials, and technological forces—these production factors, when adjusted and combined, become reasonable and produce high efficiency. The key here is to make production factors flow.

	How to achieve the reasonable flow of production factors?

	Actively promoting enterprise mergers is a powerful move. In 1988, 113 enterprises in Qiqihar participated in mergers, with an average of one enterprise being merged into another every week. Without decisive action, this is not possible. Here, mergers are not just about finding a way out for enterprises on the brink of bankruptcy, but especially about making production factors flow and move towards optimal combinations. Therefore, profitable enterprises and enterprises of different ownership can all merge, with the principle being to let the strong occupy the stage.

	The result: In just one year, 49 out of 50 merged enterprises turned losses into profits, 6,720 million yuan in idle assets, 960 million yuan in working capital, and more than 8,600 unemployed workers were transferred to advantageous enterprises.

	There are bound to be twists and turns. The leaders of the "eaten" enterprises are generally unwilling, workers feel inferior, and the supervising departments face the most pressure because they have "lost territory." For the joys and sorrows that arise during the flow of production factors, Qiqihar's macro-control departments use economic and administrative measures to play a catalytic and coordinating role.

	Qiqihar has opened markets for idle equipment, surplus materials, and labor, using market mechanisms to push those misallocated production factors to reasonable positions or to quickly improve the quality of labor that is not yet fully qualified. Over the past two years, more than 4,000 pieces of equipment worth 200 million yuan, originally idle in large and medium-sized enterprises, have been transferred to county, township, district, and street enterprises to generate benefits.

	Due to the good performance of Qiqihar's enterprises, in 1988, the city's enterprise employees' total wage bill increased by 12.5% compared to the previous year, with per capita income actually increasing by 9%, while enterprise retained profits and government fiscal revenue increased by 32.7% and 27.2%, respectively, making the pressure of inflation less pronounced.

　　调整：经济发展的杠杆
　　——记摆脱困扰争取较高效益的齐齐哈尔工业
    本报记者　武培真
    编者按　齐齐哈尔市的经验值得重视，特别是他们提出的让生产要素流动起来，不断实行优化组合，给人以启发。齐齐哈尔所以能够有力地推动社会生产力的发展，重要原因之一，就是按照价值规律、社会效益，不断实现各生产要素的流动和优化组合。想想看，如果我国的现有人力、物力、财力能够进一步做到这一点，浪费可以减少多少，财富可以增加多少！相当多的同志还没有把足够的注意力关注到这方面来。
　　　　　　
    当百万人口的齐齐哈尔市迎着改革大潮蹒跚走来的时候，身上背着１０个财政补贴县（全市只有一个县能自给）。曾有２１年，市工业产值平均递增１．５１％，大大低于同期全国６．５９％的水平；齐市的工业利税占财政收入的７５％，比全国平均水平低了１０％。
    现在呢？改革的潮头涌过，齐齐哈尔冒出浪尖，１９８８年工业产值比上年只增了６．１％；利税却增加了２４．８％。其中地方预算内企业产值增长８．９％，利税增长３２．３％。也就是说，效益远远高于全国平均水平。消耗少，产出多，效益高，改革就有了比较宽松的局面，齐齐哈尔成了令人瞩目的改革弄潮儿。
　动手术治理“畸轻畸重症”
    １９８５年以前，齐齐哈尔举步维艰，全市亏损企业达１／３。万人大厂齐崭崭摆开七八个，号称“钢铁机械城”的齐市像一个跛足巨人，重工业和轻工业的比例是７∶３；一条腿沉得拖泥带水；另一条腿轻得踩上了云。
    企业不活，经济难活。搞活企业，出路何在？
    齐齐哈尔的改革从调整企业结构入手。这里的人们看准了两点：一是齐市的工业发展没有充分发挥本地资源优势。齐市挨着大庆油田，没有石化工业；四野苇塘如海，充足的造纸资源没有利用起来；这里还有广阔的草原，却缺乏相应的皮毛、食品加工业……明摆着，传统的行政性经济管理体制使地区经济结构偏离了市场要求，过去的经济结构有很多是按着行政指令搭起来的。
    还有重要的一点，就是原有的工业内部结构不合理，过去那些“条条”下的大厂和地方工业处于隔离状态，小而全的“小社会”比肩而立，造成大量的重复建设和设施闲置。
    有了这个认识，齐市的领导者决定根据资源和生产能力优势，重点发展石油化工、医药、建材、造纸、塑料等行业，同时大力扶植原料基地。行业加工中心应运而生，取代了许多企业的小而全“麻雀工程”，各企业之间向形成综合加工能力的生产体系发展。
    几年调整大见成效。１９８８年，全市财政收入比１９８５年增长６４％；提前两年超额６％完成“七五”计划。
　“让好汉吃饱，让懒汉杀腰”
    为了加快产品调整，财政、物资、能源部门对企业实行了“让好汉吃饱，让懒汉杀腰”的做法。消耗低，增值大，与经济发展和人民生活密切并有条件上的产品，优先扶植。否则，予以压缩和限制。
    ３年来，全市淘汰次劣产品近５００种，以每年更新产品４０％的速度开发新产品千余种，全市每增加一个新产品，新增加利润大约１０万元。
    他们知道，不能一切都急功近利。齐市特别注重对本地资源开展产品的深加工和综合利用。这里有亚麻资源，他们就从引进良种入手，再搞麻制品开发；他们花了大力气把一个个沼泽地改造成芦苇塘，接着建立起纸制品加工业；为使绿色的草原多贡献财富，齐市从引进良种牛羊到开发奶制品和毛革制品开始，建起了“１５条龙”产品系列。
    调整产业结构让人们尝到了甜头。
　让生产要素流动起来，流向效益高的地方
    要发展生产，谁的资金不短缺？靠加大投入实现扩大再生产的潜力是有限的。齐齐哈尔市委和政府认为，从根本上说，还要靠挖掘内涵来提高效益。
    人、财、物、科技力量，这些生产要素通过调整，排列组合变了，合理了，就会产生高效益。这里的关键，在于要让生产要素流动起来。
    怎样实现生产要素的合理流动？
    大力推行企业兼并是一招狠棋。１９８８年，齐市有１１３家企业参与兼并，平均每周就有一个企业吃掉另一个企业。对此不下决心是不行的。这里的兼并，可以说并不是着眼于为濒临破产的企业找出路，而是特别强调使生产要素流动起来，流向优化组合。因此，盈利企业之间、不同所有制的企业都可以兼并，原则就是一条，让强者占领擂台。
    其结果：仅去年一年，５０个被兼并的企业中有４９个扭亏为盈，６７２０万元呆滞资产、９６０万元流动资金，还有８６００多名没活干的职工转入了优势企业。
    这中间曲折是免不了的。被“吃”的企业领导人大都很不情愿，职工有当“二等公民”的自卑感、主管部门压力最大，因为“丢失了地盘”。对生产要素流动过程中出现的这些喜与忧，齐齐哈尔宏观调控部门利用经济和行政手段发挥催化和协调作用。
    齐市开辟了闲置设备、剩余物资市场和劳动力市场，让市场机制把那些配置不当的生产要素推向合理位置，或是促使自身素质还不够完备的劳动力尽快完善起来。两年来，原先闲置在大中企业的价值２亿元的４０００多台设备转到县、乡和区、街企业中发挥了效益。
    由于齐齐哈尔的企业效益好，１９８８年，齐市的企业职工工资总额比上年增加１２．５％，人均收入实际增长９％，而企业留利和政府财政收入则分别增长了３２．７％和２７．２％，通货膨胀的压力就显得不那么突出了。
