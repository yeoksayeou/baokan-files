The port of Haian, located on the Leizhou Peninsula, is the main passage connecting the mainland to Hainan Province. More than 80% of people traveling to and from the island pass through here. For many years, the public has complained about the difficulties of crossing at Haian Port. Recently, reporters visited the port multiple times and found that the dock area is extremely dirty, chaotic, and in poor condition.

A manager of a company in Hainan said, "Crossing the strait is too difficult. There is no order at this dock. There are no signs indicating whether there are tickets or when the ships will depart."

A driver for Hainan Commercial Transport said, "When crossing the sea, you have to give tips to buy tickets. You also have to give tips to pass the gate and board the ship. There are many cars waiting in line, and if you don't give tips, it's very difficult to board the ship."

The problems at Haian Port have been longstanding, mainly due to the following reasons:

The management system is irrational. Various departments each control a part of the small port. The dock, ships, roads leading to the port, and the station are all under different departments. Years of fragmented leadership have effectively resulted in no one managing the port.

Additionally, the port has received little investment over the years, and the pace of updating and expanding facilities is slow. Currently, more than ten thousand passengers and over five hundred vehicles pass through Haian Port daily, but the waiting facilities at the dock are from the 1960s. The port still does not have a bus station, and buses heading to the mainland can only park in a small open area.

The problems at Haian Port are widespread and complex. The efforts of a single town, county, or city are not enough to address them. We hope that relevant departments will pay attention to this issue.

### 海南岛咽喉通道不畅

　　海南岛咽喉通道不畅
    位于雷州半岛的海安港，是大陆连接海南省的咽喉通道，出入人员的８０％以上非经此地不可。多年来，群众抱怨海安港过渡难。最近，记者多次前往采访，只见码头区脏、乱、差现象十分严重。
    一位在海南开办公司的经理说：“过海峡太难了。这个码头没有秩序。有没有票，什么时候开船，无任何标志。”
    海南商运的一位司机说：“过海时，买票要给小费，过门卡、上船还得给。车多排队，不给就很难上船。”
    海安港的问题由来已久，主要原因是：
    管理体制不合理。规模不大的港口，条条块块各持一方。码头、船只、疏港公路、车站分属不同部门。长年的多头领导，实际成了无人管理。
    其次，港口多年来投资少，设施更新、扩建速度慢。现在，每天进出海安港的旅客超过万人、车辆达５００多，而码头使用的候船设施，是６０年代建的。港口至今没有汽车站，开往内地的客车只好停在一块小空地上。
    海安港的问题涉及面广，情况复杂，单靠一镇一县和一市的力量是不够的，望能引起有关部门的重视。
