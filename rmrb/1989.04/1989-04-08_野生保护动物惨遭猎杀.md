	Thousand Island Lake Scenic Area is China's largest national forest park, a natural paradise for birds and beasts. In recent years, some people, disregarding the country's relevant prohibitions, have used slingshots, iron traps, poison bait, and explosives to indiscriminately hunt rare birds and strange beasts. Many South China tigers, black bears, clouded leopards, leopards, musk deer, and sambar deer have met with disaster. This is truly heartbreaking.

	In recent years, in the 3.6 million mu natural reserve area of Yunnan's Xishuangbanna, the sound of hunting guns has been unceasing. Last year, in just the cases solved by the public security department, there were sixteen wild oxen, two wild elephants, two leopards, eight black bears, and more than seventy water deer, peacocks, pythons, and macaques killed by hunters' guns. It is suggested that relevant departments take measures to protect the rare birds and strange beasts of Xishuangbanna.

	In the southern part of Gansu Dingxi County, there are dozens of species of national third-class protected wild animals such as pheasants, wild ducks, doves, and foxes. Recently, some people have been indiscriminately hunting wild animals in this area and then selling them in the market. If this continues, in a few years, Dingxi's wild animals will become extinct.

　　野生保护动物惨遭猎杀
    （一）
    千岛湖风景区是我国最大的国家森林公园，是飞禽走兽的天然乐园。
    近年来，有些人不顾国家的有关禁令，用土铳、铁夹、毒饵、炸药等肆意滥杀珍禽奇兽。一些华南虎、黑熊、金钱豹、云豹、梅花鹿、毛冠鹿等动物遭受劫难。实在令人痛心。

    近年来，云南西双版纳三百六十万亩自然保护区里，狩猎的枪声不绝于耳。去年，仅在公安部门侦破的案件中，就有十六头野牛、两头野象、两头豹子，八只黑熊，七十多只水鹿、孔雀、蟒蛇、獭猴等动物死于狩猎人的枪口下。建议有关部门采取措施，保护西双版纳的珍禽异兽。

    甘肃定西县南部生长着野鸡、野鸭、白鸽、狐狸等几十种国家三类野生保护动物。最近，一些人在这一地区肆意捕杀野生动物，然后拿到市场上出售。这样下去，要不了几年，定西的野生动物将会绝迹。
