	Changing the Situation of Independent and Repeated Research
	Fujian Research Institutions Collaborate in Network
	Focus on Major Issues to Advise Party and Government Departments

	Xinhua News Agency reporter Liu Xianpeng reports: Fujian Province has implemented a joint conference system for research and consulting work, organizing and coordinating the province's research forces to serve as advisors and assistants to leaders at all levels. This has recently been praised by relevant central departments as a "novel initiative."

	For a long time, research institutions and personnel have operated independently, lacking organization and coordination, leading to repeated research on many issues, or urgent decision-making issues being neglected, or research and consulting quality being low. Addressing this problem, the Fujian Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government established the joint conference system for research and consulting work in early 1987. A vice secretary of the provincial party committee and a vice governor serve as conveners, inviting the main leaders of research, scientific research institutions, and relevant comprehensive departments to participate. They organize and coordinate important research and consulting activities related to the overall situation, establishing a multi-disciplinary, multi-level network.

	Over the past year, Fujian's research departments have conducted in-depth and systematic studies on major issues such as rural reforms, enterprise reforms, political system reforms, and the development of an export-oriented economy. Many research reports with a certain depth have been adopted by leaders, and some have been circulated by leaders to relevant departments for reference and decision-making. Some research and consulting achievements have made new breakthroughs in theoretical exploration, with some viewpoints being innovative, attracting the attention of relevant central departments, and gaining recognition from the academic and media circles.

　　改变各自为战重复研究状况
　　福建调研机构连网协作
　　集中攻重大问题　为党政部门参谋
    本报讯　新华社记者刘仙鹏报道：福建省实行调研咨询工作联席会议制度，把全省的调研力量组织协调起来，充当各级党政领导的参谋助手，最近被中央有关部门称为“首创的新鲜事”。
    长期以来，调研机构和人员各自为战，缺少组织和协调，造成不少问题重复研究，或者急需决策的问题无人研究，或者研究咨询质量不高。针对这一问题，福建省委、省政府于１９８７年初建立了调研咨询工作联席会议制度，由一位省委副书记和一位副省长担任召集人，吸收调研、科研机构和有关综合部门的主要领导同志参加，就一些关联全局的重要调研咨询活动进行组织协调，建立起多学科、多层次的网络。
    一年多以来，福建调研部门对农村改革、企业改革、政治体制改革、发展外向型经济等重大问题，进行了深入、系统的研究。许多有一定深度的调研报告被领导采纳，有的被领导批给有关部门参考和决策采用。一些调研咨询成果由于在理论探索上有新的突破，一些观点有新意，引起中央有关部门的重视，得到学术界、新闻界的关注。
