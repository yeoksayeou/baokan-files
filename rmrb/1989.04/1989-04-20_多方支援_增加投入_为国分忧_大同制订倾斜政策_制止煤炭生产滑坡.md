	Multi-Sector Support, Increased Investment, Easing National Burdens
	Datong Implements Inclined Policies to Halt Coal Production Slump

	People's Daily reports: In response to the urgent demand for coal and the slump in coal production, Datong City in Shanxi Province has implemented inclined policies to support multiple sectors, increase investment, and proactively ease national burdens, ensuring the sustained production of coal. Despite the fact that mining coal does not yield profits, Datong managed to produce 4.53 million tons of raw coal in March, reversing the downward trend that occurred in January and February.

	The price of coal has remained stagnant for a long time, while the costs of raw materials and labor have been rising. Last year, 19 coal mines in Datong collectively incurred a loss of 1.03 million yuan. This year, in the first quarter, coal production experienced a slump. To stabilize production, the Datong municipal government has taken a series of measures.

	Firstly, the municipal government addressed the issue of temporary workers leaving en masse, with the number decreasing from 50,000 to 30,000. To stabilize and attract labor, 650,000 kilograms of fine grain were allocated to the coal mines. Various districts, townships, and mines also actively coordinated to solve problems related to grain, meat, and cooking oil for workers. Considering the low income of workers, a piecework wage system was implemented to increase production and income. The municipal government prioritized the supply of 115,000 kilowatts of electricity to coal mines, accounting for 46.7% of the city's total electricity supply. Addressing the low delivery rate of underground timber, the materials department allocated timber to the coal mines according to the plan.

	The municipal government also seriously addressed the short-term behavior of enterprises seeking immediate gains, integrating current production with the implementation of strategic plans. From a macro perspective, it adjusted the industrial structure and implemented an investment-inclined policy. In a situation where the city and countryside reduced 90 million yuan of construction and fixed asset investments, the focus was on supporting the coal industry. For the five major coal mines under municipal jurisdiction, each producing 300 million tons annually, the province and municipality invested 35 million yuan in phases, and each mine raised an additional 25 million yuan. Currently, most of the municipal and district-owned coal mines have technical renovation projects and expansion tasks.

　　多方支援　增加投入　为国分忧    
    大同制订倾斜政策  制止煤炭生产滑坡
    本报讯  针对煤炭用户告急、煤炭生产滑坡问题，山西省大同市在挖煤不赚钱的情况下制订倾斜政策，多方支援，增加投入，主动为国分忧，保持煤炭生产的后劲。在１、２月份生产下滑的情况下，３月生产原煤４５３万吨，扭转了滑坡局面。
    煤炭价格长期处于静止状态，但原材料、用工等不断涨价。去年，大同市有１９个煤矿共亏损１０３万元之多。今年一季度，出现了煤炭产量的滑坡。为了稳定生产，大同市政府采取了一系列措施。
    首先，市政府针对煤矿临时工自发转移严重、由５万减少到３万的情况，为稳定引进劳动力，调集６５万公斤细粮调拨给煤矿。各区、乡、矿也积极联系，为职工解决粮食、肉食、食油等，并根据职工收入偏低的情况，实行了增产增收计件工资制。市政府优先供给煤矿用电１１．５万千瓦，占全市总供电量的４６．７％。针对井下坑木到货率低的情况，物资系统按计划把坑木调拨给煤矿。
    市政府还认真解决企业急功近利的短期行为，把当前生产和实施战略计划统一起来，从宏观上调整产业结构，实行投资倾斜政策。在全市城乡压缩９０００万元基建和固定资产投资的情况下，重点扶植煤炭工业，对市属年产３００万吨的五大煤矿，省市分期投资３５００万元，各矿又力所能及地自筹２５００万元。目前，市和区属国营煤矿大多有技改项目和扩建任务。　（冯天林）
