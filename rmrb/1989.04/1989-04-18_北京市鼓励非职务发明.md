Beijing Encourages Non-Service Inventions

People's Daily, Beijing, April 18th—Reporter Jiang Jianke reports: "High-precision and cutting-edge" invention projects do not necessarily produce immediate economic benefits. An invention that was screened out in an awards evaluation and was made into a product by a seemingly insignificant township enterprise in the suburbs of Beijing has been very popular and has received many orders. A responsible person from the Beijing Invention Association said that non-service inventions should not be overlooked.

At last year's Beijing Invention Exhibition, one-third of the projects that won silver medals were non-service inventions, and more than half of the projects that won bronze medals were non-service inventions. For this reason, the Beijing Invention Association recently raised 300,000 yuan to encourage and support non-service inventions. Non-service inventions participating in the recently held 3rd Beijing Invention Exhibition only need to pay a 100 yuan exhibition fee, as a sign of encouragement.

　　北京市鼓励非职务发明
    本报北京４月１８日讯　记者蒋建科报道：“高精尖”的发明项目，不一定立即产生经济效益。一项在评奖中筛下的非职务发明，被京郊一家不起眼的乡镇企业制成产品后却大受青睐，定货颇多。北京发明协会负责人说，不应忽视非职务发明。
    在去年的北京发明展览会上，获银牌奖的项目中有１／３是非职务发明，获铜牌奖的非职务发明占到一半还多。为此，北京发明协会最近集资３０万元，鼓励支持非职务发明。参加日前第３届北京发明展览会的非职务发明，只交１００元的参展费，以示鼓励。
