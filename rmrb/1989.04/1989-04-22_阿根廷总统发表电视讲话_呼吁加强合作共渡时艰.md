Argentine President Delivers TV Speech Urging Strengthened Cooperation to Weather Difficulties

	BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Raul Alfonsin delivered a nationwide radio and television address tonight, calling for cooperation among political parties and the government to jointly shoulder responsibilities and prevent the atmosphere of doubt, arising from the approaching general election, from further undermining the country's economic order. Alfonsin also pledged that his administration would continue to fight the economic crisis until the end of his term on December 10.

	Argentina is scheduled to hold its presidential election on May 14, with campaign activities already reaching a fever pitch. As the election date draws near, an atmosphere of uncertainty has enveloped the nation, exerting a detrimental impact on the economy, which is already in a precarious state. This week, the exchange rate of the dollar to the Austral jumped from 1:55 to 1:72, the government predicts that the price index will rise by 40% in April, and the monthly interest rate has soared to 60%. The economic order is in chaos, and public morale is shaken. This year's government transition is the first in Argentina's 40-year history to occur between two democratically elected administrations, and whether it can be completed smoothly remains a serious test. Additionally, there is a seven-month transition period between the election and the inauguration of the new government. If the economic situation continues to deteriorate as it has been, the consequences could be dire. Currently, the major political forces have taken note of this and are adopting a more restrained attitude. The opposition Peronist Party, which controls the General Confederation of Labor, has withdrawn from wage negotiations with the government but has decided not to call for a general strike before the election. The union's secretary-general, Ubaldo Fillol, said, "We do not want Argentina to experience events like those in Venezuela."

	In his address tonight, Alfonsin called on all parties to share the responsibility and ensure a smooth transition through the difficult period from now until the end of the year. Observers here believe that the government's ability to control the economy has significantly weakened, and the opposition will not proactively cooperate with the government. Before the general election and until the new government takes office, Argentina's economy is unlikely to escape the quagmire of chaos.

　　阿根廷总统发表电视讲话    
    呼吁加强合作共渡时艰
    本报布宜诺斯艾利斯４月２１日电  记者李志明报道：阿根廷总统阿方辛今晚发表广播电视讲话，呼吁各政党与政府合作，共同承担义务，阻止因大选临近而产生的怀疑气氛继续破坏国家经济秩序。阿方辛并保证本届政府将坚持与经济危机作斗争，直到１２月１０日任期结束。
    阿根廷将于５月１４日举行总统选举，各党竞选活动已进入白热化阶段。随着选举日期临近，政治前景捉摸不定的气氛笼罩全国，对国家经济产生十分不利的影响，使本来已经相当严峻的经济形势更趋恶化。本周外汇市场美元与奥斯特拉尔比价从１∶５５猛跳到１∶７２，政府预测４月份物价指数将上升４０％，银行利率（月息）已上升到６０％，国家经济秩序十分混乱，人心动荡。今年的政府更迭是阿根廷４０年来第一次在两届民选政府之间进行，能否顺利完成，仍然是一个严重的考验。此外，选举后到新政府就职尚有７个月的过渡期，如果经济形势如目前趋势发展，后果不堪设想。目前，各主要政治力量业已注意到这一点，采取比较克制的态度。反对党正义党控制的总工会虽然退出了与政府的工资谈判，但决定在选举前不举行总罢工。工会总书记乌瓦尔迪尼说，我们不希望在阿根廷发生委内瑞拉那样的事件。
    阿方辛在今晚讲话中要求各方面共同承担责任，保证顺利渡过从现在到年底这一段困难时期。此间观察家认为，政府控制经济的能力已大大削弱，反对党不会主动与政府合作，在大选之前直到新政府就职之前，阿根廷经济难以摆脱混乱的泥淖。
