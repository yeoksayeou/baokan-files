The once-sparse white oil wellhouses on the green plains of Daqing have now been replaced by rows of continuously operating pumping units. Oil experts believe that Daqing Oilfield has fundamentally shifted to mechanical oil extraction, marking the end of the natural flow well era.

Daqing Oilfield has traditionally used water injection methods for oil extraction, injecting water into underground oil layers to maintain pressure and force oil to the surface from depths of over a kilometer. However, since the 1980s, the main oil layers of the field have entered a high-water content phase, and the underground pressure has reached the limit that the oil layer can withstand. Continuing to increase water injection to maintain natural flow extraction would damage the underground oil reservoir structure. Therefore, starting in 1983, Daqing Oilfield began a large-scale shift in extraction methods, converting natural flow wells to pumping units. After over six years of work, 10,841 wells in the entire oilfield have achieved mechanical oil extraction, accounting for 94% of the total number of wells.

Implementing mechanical oil extraction does not signify the aging of the oilfield. Major oilfields around the world all undergo a transition from natural flow to mechanical extraction. The shift in Daqing Oilfield's extraction methods will stabilize underground pressure, make the oil layer more stable, and slow the rise in water content. This is a significant technical measure to ensure the long-term stable production of the oilfield.

　　自喷井开采时代结束    
    大庆转向机械采油    
    可保证油田长期稳产
    新华社哈尔滨４月２３日电（通讯员魏国志）昔日大庆绿野上那寥若晨星般的洁白油井房，如今已被一座座日夜转动的抽油机所代替。石油专家认为，大庆油田基本转向机械采油，自喷井开采时代已经结束。
    大庆油田过去一直采用注水开采法采油，即向地下油层注水以保持地下压力，使原油从千米深处喷出地面。进入８０年代后，由于油田主力油层已进入高含水阶段，地下压力已达到油层所能承受的界线。如继续加大注水量以维持油田自喷开采会破坏地下油藏构造，所以从１９８３年起，大庆油田开始大面积转变开采方式，把自喷井改为抽油机井。经过６年多的工作，全油田已有１０８４１口油井实现了机械采油，占到油井总数的９４％。
    实行机械采油，并不意味着油田的衰老，世界上的大型油田开发都要经历从自喷到机械开采的转变。大庆油田开采方式的转变，可使油田地下压力下降，油层变得稳定，含水上升趋于平缓。这是保证油田长期稳产的重大技术错施。
