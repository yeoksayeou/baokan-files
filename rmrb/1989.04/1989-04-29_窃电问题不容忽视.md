The issue of electricity theft cannot be ignored. According to investigations by relevant departments of the Ministry of Energy, electricity theft is rampant across the country in the current situation of tight electricity supply and demand, and it persists despite repeated bans. Statistics show that the amount of electricity stolen nationwide each year reaches over 10 billion kilowatt-hours, resulting in over 1 billion yuan in lost electricity fees for the state. If we calculate that each kilowatt-hour of electricity in China creates at least 2.5 yuan in comprehensive value, the value lost nationwide each year due to electricity theft alone would be over 25 billion yuan.

The main areas where electricity theft occurs are in rural and urban residential electricity use and industrial production electricity use, especially in rural and urban areas where one-meter-per-household is implemented, where professional households and individual households have more severe electricity theft issues. The Northeast Electric Power Bureau conducted a sample survey in the Liaoning power supply area, and the theft rates by household were: cities 4-10%, counties and towns 10-20%, and rural areas 20-40%.

The main reasons why this activity persists despite repeated bans are, first, people do not consider stealing electricity to be a crime. Second, the crackdown on electricity theft is not strong enough.

It is reported that the Ministry of Energy and the Ministry of Public Security are currently drafting a notice to strictly prohibit electricity theft, which will soon be issued for nationwide implementation, making the punishment of electricity theft work legally enforceable. The illegal behavior of electricity theft will undoubtedly be severely cracked down upon.

　　窃电问题不容忽视
    据能源部有关部门的调查表明，在当前电力供需矛盾紧张的情况下，全国各地窃电活动十分严重，且屡禁不止。据统计，全国一年被窃的电量达１０多亿千瓦时，国家少收入电费１亿多元。如果按我国每千瓦时电最少创造２．５元综合产值算，全国每年因窃电一项损失的产值就达２５亿元之多。
    窃电范围主要分布在电网供电的农村、城镇的居民生活用电、企业生产用电中，特别是在农村和城镇实行一户一表地区的专业户、个体户窃电现象更加严重。东北电管局对辽宁供电区作了一次抽样调查，按户统计的窃电比例为：城市４—１０％，县镇１０—２０％，农村２０—４０％。
    此种活动屡禁不止的主要原因，其一是人们并不认为偷电是犯罪。其次是对窃电行为打击不力。
    据悉，最近能源部、公安部正在制定严禁窃电的通告，不久将颁布全国执行，使处罚窃电工作有法可依。窃电的违法行为必将受到严厉打击。
