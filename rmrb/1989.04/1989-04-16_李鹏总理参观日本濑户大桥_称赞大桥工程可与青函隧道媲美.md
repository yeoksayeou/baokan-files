Xinhua News Agency, Okayama, April 15th.

Premier Li Peng visited the Seto Ohashi Bridge, the world's longest combined road and rail bridge, in the Seto Inland Sea this morning. This was the first time the bridge, which opened to traffic on April 10 last year, has welcomed a foreign government leader.

The white "Hiyoku" No. 3 yacht, flying the flags of China and Japan, carried Premier Li Peng and his wife. Escorted by seven patrol boats from the Japan Coast Guard, the yacht sailed around the bridge in the nearby sea.

The Seto Ohashi Bridge stretches from Eshima Town in Okayama Prefecture to Sakouti City in Kagawa Prefecture, connecting the islands of Honshu and Shikoku for the first time in history with six suspension bridges and cable-stayed bridges.

The massive project drew great interest from Premier Li Peng and his entourage, who listened attentively to the explanations provided by Honzo Kase, Chairman of the Seto Ohashi Bridge Authority, and asked detailed questions about the funding sources and loan repayment methods.

Premier Li Peng praised the project, saying, "This is an extraordinary engineering feat. Top-notch technology has connected the regions of Honshu and Shikoku. I have visited the Seikan Tunnel in northern Japan, and this project is comparable to it." His in-depth questions impressed the Japanese officials. When he asked if the toll of 6,500 yen for a car to cross the bridge was too high, Kase smiled wryly and said, "Your question is very sharp. There have indeed been such opinions. However, considering the need to repay nearly 1 trillion yen in loans over 33 years, the high toll has been approved by the government."

At one end of the bridge in Sakouti City, Kagawa Prefecture, Premier Li Peng and his entourage visited the Seto Ohashi Bridge Memorial Hall. Governor Seiihei Hirai and Assembly Chairman Hideo Nakanishi of Kagawa Prefecture showed them pictures in the hall's section on exchanges with China, introducing historical figures from Kagawa such as the monk Kukai, former table tennis champion Junko Matsuzaki, and the late former Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira, as well as touching stories of exchanges between various cities and towns in Kagawa and China.

Premier Li Peng and his wife also met Junichi Morita, a member of the Japanese House of Representatives and son-in-law of the late Prime Minister Ohira, who had come to welcome them. Premier Li Peng said, "We met your mother-in-law yesterday." Morita mentioned that he had visited China as a secretary to Prime Minister Ohira and had met Premier Zhou Enlai, leaving a deep impression that he still remembered.

Premier Li Peng and his entourage arrived in Okayama this morning by plane from Tokyo. Okayama is a city with a long history of exchanges with China. At noon, leaders of Okayama Prefecture and City hosted a luncheon for Premier Li Peng and his entourage.

### 李鹏总理参观日本濑户大桥　称赞大桥工程可与青函隧道媲美

　　李鹏总理参观日本濑户大桥
  　称赞大桥工程可与青函隧道媲美
    新华社冈山４月１５日电　（记者王大军）正在日本访问的李鹏总理今天上午在濑户内海乘船参观了目前世界上最长的公路铁路两用桥——濑户大桥（本四联络桥）。
    这座大桥自去年４月１０日通车以来，今天是第一次迎接外国政府领导人参观。
    李鹏夫妇一行乘坐的“飞翔”３号白色游艇，挂着中日两国国旗。在日本海上保安厅７艘巡逻艇护卫下，乘风破浪，在大桥附近的海面上行驶了一周。
    濑户大桥北起冈山县儿岛町，南至香川县坂出市，有史以来首次将日本本州和四国两大岛用６座正吊桥和斜吊桥联接起来。
    它像一条银灰色的巨龙横卧在濑户内海的万里碧波上。这一宏大工程引起李鹏一行极大兴趣，他们详细认真地听取了本四联络桥公团总裁加濑正藏的介绍，并不断地提出建桥费用来源、如何偿还贷款等问题。
    李鹏称赞说：“这是了不起的一项大工程。一流的技术把本州和四国两个地区连结起来。我曾经参观过日本北方的青函隧道，这一工程可与之相媲美。”他从各个角度提出的询问使日方人员深表钦佩。当他说一辆小汽车过一次桥收费６５００日元是否贵了些时，加濑苦笑着说：“您问得很尖锐，的确有这种反映。不过，考虑到要在３３年内还清将近１万亿日元的借款，收取这么高的路费还是得到政府的允许。”
    在大桥一端的香川县坂出市，李鹏一行参观了本四联络桥纪念馆。香川县知事平井诚一、县议会议长仲西秀信指着该县同中国交流栏中的多幅图片，介绍了历史上的空海大师、当年日本乒坛名将松崎君代、已经逝去的日本前首相大平正芳等香川人士以及各市、町同中国密切交往的感人事例。
    李鹏夫妇在这里还见到了特地前来欢迎的大平正芳的女婿、日本国会众议员森田一。李鹏说：“昨天我们还见到你的岳母呢。”森田说，他当年作为大平首相的秘书到过中国访问，见过周恩来总理等，印象很深，至今难忘。
    李鹏一行是今天早上乘飞机从东京来到冈山的。冈山市是与中国交流源远流长的地方。中午，冈山县、市领导人宴请了李鹏一行。
