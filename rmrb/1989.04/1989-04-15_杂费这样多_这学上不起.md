The various fees we have to pay at Anhua Secondary School for the second half of 1988 include: tuition and miscellaneous fees, water and electricity fees, lecture notes fees, staff fees, movie fees, textbook fees, physical education and health fees, vacation homework fees, insurance fees, experiment fees, registration fees, school operation fees, class management fees, depreciation fees, pest control fees, exercise book fees, coal fees, and study material fees. Altogether, it adds up to a significant amount. We have no complaints about paying the necessary fees, but are all these fees reasonable? If things continue this way, we really can't afford to study anymore.

　　杂费这样多　这学上不起
    我们安化二中要学生交纳的１９８８年下半学期的费用有：学杂费、水电费、讲义费、工友费、电影费、课本费、体育卫生费、假期作业费、保险费、实验费、报名费、办学费、班务费、折旧费、驱虫费、作业本费、煤费、学习资料费，等等，加起来是一笔不小的数目。该交的费用我们的家长毫无怨言，但这些收费是否都合理呢？如此下去，这个学我们确实上不起了。
