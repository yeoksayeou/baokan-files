The State Council's organizational reform has entered the acceptance phase, with a focus on implementing functional changes, addressing new issues encountered by new functions and organizations during operation, and establishing regulations for organizational and staffing management. Preliminary statistics show that by the end of 1988, the actual number of personnel in various departments under the State Council had decreased by more than 7,600 compared to the end of 1987.

Zhang Zhiji, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Personnel, revealed this information today. He said that the "three definitions" (defining organizations, defining staffing, and defining personnel) plans for various departments and directly affiliated institutions under the State Council have been approved one by one by the Premier's Office or the State Council's Organizational and Staffing Commission. Economic departments have weakened their direct intervention in enterprise micro-management functions and strengthened their policy and regulatory, indirect control functions. The State Council has also successively conducted trials of functional decomposition and job refinement in departments such as the Ministry of Light Industry and the State Environmental Protection Administration, achieving the concretization of government functional transformation and laying the foundation for implementing the civil servant system.

It is understood that the State Council recently held a meeting to arrange for the organizational reform acceptance work, requiring the acceptance work to be basically completed by the end of this year.

　　国务院机构改革转入验收
    去年底实有人数比前年减少７６００多
    新华社北京４月３日电  （记者吴士深、李志勇）人事部副部长张志坚今天透露，国务院各部门机构改革目前进入验收阶段，重点是落实职能转变，解决新职能新机构在运行中遇到的新问题，建立机构编制管理法规。据初步统计，至１９８８年年底，国务院各部门实有人数比１９８７年年底减少７６００多人。
    张志坚在向出席七届全国人大二次会议的上海代表介绍情况时说，国务院各部委、直属机构“三定”（定机构、定编制、定人员）方案已经总理办公会或国家机构编制委员会会议逐个审定完毕。经济部门弱化直接干预企业微观管理职能，强化了政策法规、间接调控的职能。国务院还先后在轻工业部、国家环保局等部门进行了职能分解、职位细化的试点，实现政府职能转变具体化，为推行公务员制度打下了基础。
    据悉，国务院最近召开会议，布置了机构改革验收工作，要求验收工作大体于今年年底前完成。
