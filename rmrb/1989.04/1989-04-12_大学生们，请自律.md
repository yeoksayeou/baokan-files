How should a socialist university manage its students? Especially in the context of reform and opening up, and in the new era of planned commodity economy, how should we manage these young adults who have a relatively high level of cultural and scientific knowledge but lack life experience? How can we ensure that their behavior and morality conform to the norms?

College Students, Please Practice Self-Discipline

By reporters Bì Quánzhōng, Zhōu Qìng, and Xiāo Guāngēn

Deep in the heart of Shenzhen University, disciplinary actions and expulsions of students are signed by Fán Yùpíng, an economics major in his fourth year and the chairman of the Student Self-Discipline Committee.

Fán Yùpíng says he sleeps only about five and a half hours a day, always busy.

Power and responsibility are equal. To do a good job in student management, in November last year, he went to Beijing, Shandong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, and other places to investigate student work at his own expense. The most profound impression he got from this investigation was: in many inland universities, there are so many full-time cadres doing student work, but some students told him privately that they generally do not dare to speak their true thoughts to these teachers.

Fán Yùpíng's impression was so deep because he had a reference: Shenzhen University. In this university without walls, there are more than 10,000 students of various kinds, including more than 3,000 boarding students. The school's environmental sanitation, security, teaching order, as well as banks, guesthouses, shops, libraries, and even the president's secretary are all managed by students. The school has a Student Work Guidance Committee, with the president, Luó Zhēngqǐ, as the chairman and the director of the Party Office, Táng Cái Rú, as the vice-chairman. Except for Táng, all the teachers working in this committee are volunteers. There are no full-time student workers here, but everyone who has been to Shenzhen University praises its beautiful and clean campus, orderly management, and high work efficiency. During our days of reporting in the school, we had another feeling: in the office building, library, and other public places (except the playground), we did not hear loud noises. People spoke in low voices, afraid to disturb others.

Behind all this, there is a factor playing a significant role: student self-discipline and self-governance. The degree of this self-discipline and self-governance indeed surprises some inland universities. During our reporting in some inland universities, we saw the opposite situation.

In a university in Tianjin, every night at 11 o'clock, the lights in the dormitories are turned off. Students who want to read have to buy candles in bundles. If there is noise, the school fines them, so the corridors are often posted with fine notices. In front of the female dormitory building, there is a sign saying "No males allowed," and in front of the male dormitory building, there is a sign saying "No females allowed." A teacher shook his head and said, "Isn't this a regression to the Middle Ages?"

A person, if strictly controlled, will always have the impulse to be naughty and do something out of bounds. But even a primary school student, once given a responsibility, will immediately take on the demeanor of an adult and instruct his classmates.

In universities, we often hear the sigh, "Today's students are hard to manage." One important reason is the lack of attention to cultivating students' sense of responsibility.

The education department has held so many meetings and issued so many documents. Schools have a large team of student workers, but student management (including student ideological and political work) remains a weak link. Every year, they call for "strengthening ideological and political work," every year they issue documents and add full-time workers, but the work is not strengthened, and it remains a problem that has plagued the education sector and society for a long time. Where is the problem? People are thinking in various ways.

A teacher from Renmin University of China, who has done student management work for many years, said: "The current student management system is worth studying. From the time students enter school until they graduate and are assigned jobs, everything is taken care of by the school. If you don't take care of it enough, the students will not be satisfied. We are cultivating students' dependence, not the ability to live independently. Before the Cultural Revolution, universities generally did not have class advisors. Now, not only do undergraduate students have class advisors, but even graduate students have class advisors. The more you take care of them, the harder they are to manage."

A political instructor from a department at Peking University said: "Society is undergoing great changes, and students' thoughts and behaviors cannot help but be influenced. The whole society is becoming more diverse, and students' thoughts and activities are also becoming more diverse and non-group-oriented. For example, now there are more elective courses, more school-wide club activities, and fewer collective activities based on classes. It is difficult to continue the system of assigning class advisors or political instructors based on classes." Professor Jīn Kāichéng of Peking University's Chinese Department said: "The ideological education and management of students are too biased towards verbal instruction, neglecting students' subjectivity, which makes it difficult to be effective." He believes that the key is to establish a mechanism for students to self-discipline in management, so that students' behavior can be self-regulated, and the main work of educators should be changed to guiding students' psychology and behavior.

The above discussions reflect a new way of thinking, that is, to find new paths outside the traditional management system and methods.

Some schools have already started to explore new paths. Guangzhou University has no walls, and all students commute. Every morning, students come from all directions to attend classes, walking towards the teaching buildings, libraries, and laboratories, these "sacred halls." This school does not guarantee job assignments for graduates, and the number of faculty and staff is also very small. In theory, it should be more difficult to manage students and regulate their behavior. However, the actual situation is different. The vast majority of students are diligent and self-motivated. They are very grateful for every convenience provided by the school, such as opening a new parking lot or improving the cafeteria's food. There are those who dislike studying and even drop out midway, but they are very few. We talked with some students from this school, and they said: "Teachers don't need to lecture us too much. We know we have to study hard. We have nothing to rely on. Everything depends on our own efforts."

A second-year student in the Architecture Department, Chén Jiānyù, said: "We have a sense of crisis as soon as we enter school. Our competitors are South China University of Technology. They are old universities, but I have the confidence to compete with them!" To enhance her advantages, she used her vacation to investigate the needs of the construction industry, decided to learn as much as possible in computer software and other aspects, and also took elective courses in interior decoration art. She also actively did more student work to enhance her service awareness and organizational abilities.

Another student in the Architecture Department, Guō Wénjìn, said: "The old university's Architecture Department teaches more theoretical knowledge than us, and they may be stronger in construction in the future, but I have taken management courses and public relations courses. In the future, I will manage construction, and you will manage the construction!" The spirit of striving for progress and daring to compete is evident.

This spirit can be seen in the vast majority of students in this school. President Zhāng Shìxùn said:

In the context of a commodity economy, we must cultivate students' spirit of active competition and solve their own problems independently. Student management is mainly the responsibility of the students themselves, which is very beneficial to their growth.

The most representative of students' self-discipline mechanism is the activities of the Student Self-Discipline Committee of Shenzhen University.

A notice is posted on the school's bulletin board: Student Council Chairman Zōu Yún and the editor-in-chief of the Student Council's newspaper "Yuehai Tide," Shào Bīnjūn, had a fight, violating school rules. The Student Self-Discipline Committee decided to give them disciplinary actions: Zōu Yún received a demerit, and the Student Council was advised to let him "make amends for his mistakes and continue to serve as chairman"; Shào Bīnjūn received a warning. After receiving the disciplinary action, Zōu Yún continued to work hard and made many achievements in management. Shào Bīnjūn resigned from the position of editor-in-chief of "Yuehai Tide" and worked as a cleaner in the work-study program, also doing a good job. Similar student disputes, since the establishment of this Student Self-Discipline Committee in 1985, have been handled hundreds of times, of which more than 30 students have been disciplined, ranging from warnings, demerits to expulsion, with no objections. Since the second half of last year, all student disciplinary actions have been decided by the Student Self-Discipline Committee and announced in its name, no longer in the name of the president.

The Student Self-Discipline Committee has a high prestige, and its members are all elected in the student congress. Its main responsibilities are to protect the legitimate rights of students, accept students' complaints about immoral behavior, unfair incidents, and violations, investigate and handle violators and disputes between students, notarize students' work-study contracts, and organize personnel to patrol the campus, maintain campus order, and protect school property, covering a wide range, but mainly self-discipline. The current chairman of the Self-Discipline Committee, Fán Yùpíng, has handled more than 100 cases during his one-year term, of which 16 students have been disciplined.

"We handle things very carefully, repeatedly investigate, repeatedly talk with the parties involved, and for those who receive expulsion, we also go to the students' hometown to understand the family situation and contact the parents," said Fán Yùpíng. "Students' complaints are more frequent in the first semester of each academic year (when new students enroll) and less in the second semester; first-year students have more incidents, second-year students have significantly fewer, and third- and fourth-year students have even fewer. This shows that students' self-discipline ability is gradually improving after entering this university."

The activities of the Self-Discipline Committee are a form of collective self-discipline, which is based on individual self-discipline. Among the students of Shenzhen University, the most resonant slogan is "self-reliance, self-discipline, self-improvement." It can be said that the starting point of the students' self-discipline mechanism, in addition to the external system of not guaranteeing job assignments after graduation, is mainly the concept and practice of self-reliance. Shenzhen University students pay tuition fees, and the cost of living in Shenzhen is high, with each student spending more than 100 yuan per month on food. Students propose to earn their own living expenses, and the fees must be self-sufficient, so they carry out work-study programs on campus. All work-study positions, including sweeping the streets and cleaning trash, are obtained through recruitment and competition, and contracts are signed to determine responsibilities and benefits. The work-study activities of the entire school are also organized and managed by students, with the school only providing guidance. President Luó Zhēngqǐ is very moved by this, saying: "The lack of full-time political workers does not mean the cancellation or neglect of ideological and political work. In fact, every teacher and cadre is doing the students' ideological and political work, and the students themselves are also doing it, just not in a full-time capacity, and the methods are different." Indeed, student self-discipline is to discipline oneself, and self-governance is to govern oneself. This is self-discipline. If one does not practice self-discipline, self-governance, and self-discipline, and everything has to be strictly controlled by others, one will never mature, and a sense of responsibility will never be established.

If our college students can all practice self-discipline and self-governance and grow into model citizens, then the country will be fortunate! The nation will be fortunate!

### 大学生们，请自律

    社会主义的大学究竟该怎样管理学生？尤其是在改革开放的形势下、在发展有计划的商品经济的新时期，如何管理这些已经成年、具有较高文化科学知识却又涉世不深的群体？怎样使他们的行为和道德符合规范？
　　大学生们，请自律
　　本报记者　毕全忠　周庆　萧关根
    深圳大学处分、开除学生，布告由樊聿平签署。此人是经济系四年级学生，学生自律委员会主任。
    樊聿平说他每天睡5个多小时，忙得不可开交。
    权力和义务是相等的。为了做好学生管理工作，去年11月，他曾自费赴北京、山东、江苏、上海等地区考察学生工作。考察给他印象最深的是：内地高校有那么多专职干部做学生工作，但有些学生私下却告诉他，一般不敢跟这些老师讲真心话。
    樊聿平的这个印象所以深刻，是因为他有一个参照系：深圳大学。在这所没有围墙的大学里，各类学生有1万多名，其中住校生3000多名。学校的环境卫生、安全保卫、教学秩序，连同银行、招待所、商店、图书馆都由学生管理，连校长的秘书也都由学生担任。学校有一个学生工作指导委员会，主任是校长罗征启，副主任是党委办公室主任唐才儒，除唐一人外，所有在这个委员会工作的老师，都是自愿兼职的。这里没有学生工作专职人员，但凡是到过深圳大学的，无不称赞它那美丽整洁的校园、井井有条的秩序和很高的办事效率。我们在该校采访数日，还有一个感受，就是在办公楼、图书馆和其他公共场合（除运动场），都听不到高声喧哗，人们谈话都是低调门，生怕影响了别人。
    在这一切的里层，有一个因素在起着很大的作用，那就是学生自律、自治。这种自律、自治的程度，确实使内地一些大学感到吃惊。我们在内地一些大学采访，看到的多是相反的情况。
    在天津某大学，每天晚上11点学生宿舍关灯，学生想看书的，一包一包买蜡烛。有吵闹的，学校罚款，以致楼道里经常张贴着罚款通知。女生宿舍楼前挂着“男生不得入内”的牌子，男生宿舍楼前则挂着“女生不得入内”的牌子，一位老师摇头道：“这不倒退到中世纪去了吗？”
    一个人，只要被死死管着，就总有想调皮一下、搞点越轨动作的冲动。而哪怕是一个小学生，一旦肩负起责任，也会俨然以一副大人模样训导同学。
    在大学，经常听到“现在的学生难管”这样的感叹，不注意唤起学生的责任感是一个重要原因。
    教育部门开了那么多会，发了那么多文件，学校有宏大的学生工作者队伍，可是学生管理工作（其中包括学生思想政治工作）仍然是个薄弱环节。年年喊“加强思想政治工作”，年年发文件、加专职工作人员，可是工作却加而不强，至今仍然是困扰教育界和社会的难题之一。毛病出在什么地方呢？人们在作各种各样的思考。
    中国人民大学一位做过多年学生管理工作的教师说：“现在学生管理工作的体制值得研究。从学生进校一直到毕业分配工作，都由学校包下来，你包得不够，学生就不满意。我们是在培养学生的依赖性，不是培养独立生活的能力。‘文革’前大学里一般没有什么班主任，现在不仅大学生有班主任，连研究生也有班主任。越包就越难管理。”
    北京大学某系一位政治辅导员说：“社会处于大变革之中，学生的思想、行为不能不受影响。整个社会趋于多元化，学生的思想、活动也在多元化、非群体化。举例来说，现在选修课多了，全校性的社团活动多了，以班为单位的集体活动少了，同一班的学生都很少见面，以班为单位配置班主任或政治辅导员的体制很难搞下去了。”北京大学中文系教授金开诚说：“对学生的思想教育和管理太偏重于言教，忽视了学生的主体意识，这就难以奏效。”他认为重要的是在管理中建立起学生自我约束的机制，使学生的行为能自我规范，教育者的主要工作应改为对学生作心理、行为指导。
    上述议论反映了一种新的思考，即在传统的管理体制和方法之外寻找新的路径。
    一些学校已在新的路径上开拓前进。广州大学没有围墙，学生全部走读。每天清晨，学生们从四面八方赶来上学，走向教学楼、图书馆、实验室这些“神圣的殿堂”。这所学校学生毕业不包分配，教职工人数也很少，照理说，对学生的管理更为困难，更难规范他们的行为。可是实际情况却不然，绝大多数学生勤奋好学，而且很自觉。他们对校方提供的每个方便如多辟一个存车场所、食堂伙食的每一次改善，都会感到由衷的高兴。厌学甚至中途退学的不是没有，但极少。我们和该校的一些学生交谈，他们说：“不需要老师对我们讲多少道理，我们知道要好好学习。我们没有什么好依赖的，一切要靠我们自己努力。”
    该校建筑系二年级学生陈健瑜说：“我们一入学就有危机感。我们竞争的对手是华南理工大学。他们是老大学，但我有信心跟他们竞争！”为了增强自己的优势，她利用假期到建筑行业去调查行业需要，决定在计算机软件等方面尽量多学一些，还选修了装潢艺术等课程，并且主动多做学生工作，以增强自己的服务观念和组织能力。
    建筑系的另一位学生郭文晋说：“老大学建筑系理论知识教得比我们多，将来搞施工可能比我们强，但我选修了管理专业课程和公共关系课，将来我搞施工管理，管你这施工的！”向上进取、勇于竞争的精神溢于言表。
    这种精神在该校绝大多数学生身上都可以看到。校长张世勋教授说：
    在商品经济的条件下，必须培养学生主动竞争的精神，独立解决自己的问题。学生管理主要是学生自己承担的，这对他们的成长很有好处。
    最能体现学生自我约束机制的，还是深圳大学学生自律委员会的活动。
    该校布告牌上贴出一张布告：学生会主席邹云同学跟学生会报《粤海潮》主编邵滨军同学打架，违反校纪。学生自律委员会决定分别给以处分：邹云同学受记过处分，建议学生会让他“戴错立功”，继续担任主席；邵滨军同学受批评处分。邹云受到处分后仍认真工作，在管理中作出不少成绩。邵滨军辞去了《粤海潮》主编职务，在勤工俭学中当了清洁工，也干得很好。类似的学生纠纷，这个学生自律委员会自1985年建立以来已处理了几百起，其中处分了30多名同学，处分从批评、警告、记过到开除学籍都有，没有不服的。从去年下半年起，对学生的处分一概由学生自律委员会作出决定并以它的名义公布，不再以校长的名义公布。
    学生自律委员会有很高的威望，其成员都是在学代会上竞选出来的。它的主要职责是保护同学的正当权益，受理同学们对不道德行为、不公平事件、违纪事件的投诉，调查处理违纪者和同学间的纠纷，为同学的勤工俭学合同作公证，以及组织人员巡视校园、维护校内秩序和保护校产等，范围很广，但主要是自律。现任自律委员会主任樊聿平在他这一年任期内，共处理了100多起事件，其中给处分的共有16名同学。
    “我们处理事情非常慎重，要反复调查，反复跟当事人谈，给开除处分的还要到学生原籍了解家庭情况，跟家长联系。”樊聿平说，“同学们的投诉每学年第一个学期（新生入学）多，第二学期就少了；一年级学生中发生的事多，二年级大为减少，三、四年级中就更少了。这说明学生进入这所大学后，自律能力是逐步提高的。”
    自律委员会的活动是一种集体自律，它是建立在个人自律的基础之上的。在深圳大学学生中间，最响亮的口号是“自立、自律、自强”。可以说，学生自我约束机制的发端，除了毕业不包分配的外部体制外，主要是自立的观念与实践。深圳大学学生要交学费，深圳物价贵，伙食费每人每月就要100多元。学生提出要自己挣饭吃，费用要自力，于是在校内开展勤工俭学。所有勤工俭学岗位包括扫马路、掏垃圾都通过招聘、竞争来获得，并要签订合同，确定责与利。全校勤工俭学活动也由学生来组织和管理，校方只作指导。对此，罗征启校长很感慨，他说：“没有专职政工人员不等于取消或不重视思想政治工作，事实上每个教师、干部都在做学生的思想政治工作，学生们自己也在做，只不过不是专职，做法也有不同而已。”确实，学生自律是律自己，自治是治自己，这就是自我约束。不自律、不自治、不自我约束，什么事都要别人死死管着，人是永远不能成熟起来的，责任感也是永远建立不起来的。
    如果我们的大学生都能自律、自治，成长为模范公民，则国家幸甚！民族幸甚！
