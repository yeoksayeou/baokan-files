	Some townships in our city have seen over 130 instances of clan disputes between 1986 and 1988, with each incident involving 30 to 40 people, and the largest involving over 200 people. In mid-November of last year, two villagers in Maotian Village, Sifen Township, had a dispute over a residential site, leading to a confrontation involving 40 people from the Guo and Yi clans. In another incident, two farmers in Baitu Tan Township had a dispute over a plot of land, which escalated into a conflict involving 230 people from two clans in two townships, nearly resulting in a bloody incident. The feudal clan influence is seriously affecting social order.

　　一些乡镇发生宗族纠纷
    一九八六年至一九八八年，我市一些家族相互发生争吵闹事一百三十多起，每起都有三四十人参加，最多的一次达二百多人。去年十一月中旬，泗汾镇茂田村两个村民为争宅基地而发生矛盾，结果郭姓和易姓家族各有四十多人参与争吵。白兔谭镇两个农民为争一块菜地，引起两个镇两姓家族的二百三十多人势不两立，险些酿成流血事件。封建家族歪风严重影响社会治安。
