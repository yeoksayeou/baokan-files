    U.S. and Japan Agree to Jointly Develop FSX Fighter Jet

    WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bush today announced that the U.S. and Japanese governments have reached an agreement to jointly design and produce a new type of FSX fighter jet. Bush emphasized that this agreement will protect U.S. sensitive technology and jobs. Bush said that the U.S. has considered both strategic and diplomatic policies, as well as U.S. foreign trade, industrial growth, and technology transfer. "I believe the development of this aircraft is in line with U.S. strategic and commercial interests," he said, and will "improve U.S.-Japan defense."

    The FSX aircraft is an advanced version of the U.S. F-16 fighter jet and will be used to provide air protection for Japan's sea lanes. After the U.S. and Japan reached an agreement on joint development last autumn, they faced strong criticism from the U.S. Congress and other parties. Opponents argued that Japan would use the technology transferred by the U.S. to develop its own civilian aircraft industry, thereby competing with the U.S. After Bush took office, he reopened negotiations based on the Commerce Department's recommendations, clarified some key terms, and forced the Japanese side to make many concessions.

    Bush said that according to the agreement, U.S. companies will undertake 40% of the work in both the design and production phases and will restrict the transfer of key software technology to Japan. White House senior officials said that Japan will only be able to access the basic computer components of the weapon control system, but will not obtain the new flight data control system recently developed by the U.S. The agreement also ensures that the U.S. can obtain new technologies developed by the Japanese side during the aircraft's development.

    After the agreement was announced, it immediately faced attacks from some congressmen. Senator Jesse Helms called the agreement "disappointing" because the White House "conceded too much in many areas." Representative James Florio believed that the agreement gave Japan the specialized knowledge it lacked, allowing it to "directly challenge the U.S.'s leading position in international civilian and military goods trade."

### 就联合研制ＦＳＸ战斗机  美日达成协议

　　就联合研制ＦＳＸ战斗机    
    美日达成协议
    本报华盛顿４月２８日电  记者仓立德报道：美国总统布什今天宣布，美国和日本政府达成联合设计并生产新型ＦＳＸ战斗机的协议。布什强调，这项协议将保护美国的敏感技术和职业。布什说，美国既考虑了战略政策和外交政策，也权衡了美国的外贸、工业增长及技术转让；“我相信研制这种飞机符合美国的战略和商业利益”，并“将改进美国和日本的防务”。
    ＦＳＸ飞机是美国先进的Ｆ１６型战斗机的改进型，将用来为日本的海上通道提供空中保护。美日经过谈判于去秋达成联合研制协议后，遭到美国国会及其他人士的强烈批评。反对者认为日本将用美国转让的技术发展自己的民用飞机工业，进而与美国竞争。布什就任总统后，根据商业部建议重开谈判，澄清了一些关键性条款，并迫使日方作出许多让步。
    布什说，根据协定，美国厂家将在飞机的设计和生产两阶段承担４０％的工作量，并限制美国向日本转让关键性的软件技术。白宫高级官员表示，日本只能接触武器控制系统的电脑基本元件，但不能得到美国新近研制的飞行数据控制系统，同时协定还保证美国可以得到日方在研制飞机过程中发展的新技术。
    协定公布后，立即遭到一些国会议员的攻击。参议员杰西·霍尔姆斯称此协定令人“失望”，因为白宫“在许多方面让步过多”。众议员詹姆斯·弗罗里奥认为该协定给予日本所缺乏的专门知识，使它“直接向美国在国际民用品和军用品交易中的领导地位挑战”。
