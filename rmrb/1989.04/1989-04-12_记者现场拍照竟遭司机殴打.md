On the afternoon of March 4, around 3 PM, Zhang Jilin, a reporter from the White Silver Daily, boarded a bus (vehicle number 01-0579, internal number 3109) operated by the Lanzhou Automobile Public Transportation Company from White Silver City to Lanzhou City. Due to overcrowding, some passengers were sitting on the engine hood of the bus. Whenever the bus approached a checkpoint, the driver and the ticket seller would signal the passengers to crouch down to avoid inspection. Zhang Jilin took out his camera and captured the scene of passengers sitting on the engine hood. The driver was very angry about this. At around 5 PM, when the bus arrived in Lanzhou, Zhang Jilin had just gotten off the bus when the driver, who had also gotten off, stopped him. The driver said, "I know you are a reporter." After saying this, he grabbed Zhang Jilin by the neck and punched him several times in the chest. Then he threw him to the ground and dragged him by the collar for about two meters. Before leaving, the driver threatened, "You can go to any place to report this, and I will drive you there!"

The work of reporters conducting interviews is a legitimate job. This bus driver's assault on the reporter should be seriously investigated and dealt with by the relevant departments.

　　记者现场拍照竟遭司机殴打
    3月4日下午3时许，甘肃白银报记者张冀林乘坐兰州汽车公交公司的一辆客车（车号01——0579、自编号3109）从白银市前往兰州市。因汽车超员，有的乘客坐在汽车引擎盖上。途中每逢要路过检查关口时，司机和售票员便示意乘客蹲下，以躲避检查。张冀林拿出照像机拍下乘客坐在引擎盖上的镜头。对此，司机大为恼火。下午5时许，车到兰州。张冀林刚下车，被跳下车的司机拦住，司机说：“我知道你是记者。”说完，便一把卡住张冀林的脖子，对准他的胸部连击数拳。然后将他摔倒在地上，并揪住衣领拖了两米远。司机临走时还扬言：“你愿到哪里去告，我开车送你！”
    记者采访属于正当工作，这位汽车司机殴打记者，有关部门应该严肃查处。
