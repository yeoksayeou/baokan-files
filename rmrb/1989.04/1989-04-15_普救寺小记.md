Pujian Temple, famous for "The Romance of the Western Chamber," is located in the town of Emei in Yongji County, Shanxi Province. It is situated to the west of the vast Yellow River and to the south of the towering Zhongtiao Mountains. The Yingying Pagoda within the temple is one of the four remaining ancient echo structures in China, and it is renowned alongside the Leaning Tower of Pisa and other famous towers around the world.

Pujian Temple was originally built during the Sui Dynasty. After enduring numerous wars and upheavals, only the Yingying Pagoda, the Bodhisattva Cave, stone lions, and a few stone tablets remain, which has diminished the interest of many domestic and foreign tourists. However, after years of continuous restoration, the temple's red walls and green tiles, the serene and quiet meditation rooms, and the flower-filled courtyard of the western wing have once again captured the eyes of visitors.

Following the route taken by Zhang Sheng in the play to visit the western wing, we specifically came to the place known as "Pujian Moonlight," one of the Eight Scenic Views of the Yellow River. By striking stones together, we heard the sound of frogs coming from the Yingying Pagoda. Legend has it that this frog sound is the penitence of the old lady after being whipped by the crowd, serving as a reminder to future generations not to repeat the foolish act of separating lovers. Recently, the acoustic secrets of the Yingying Pagoda have been unveiled by experts: the unique terrain, special architectural structure, and unique building materials all contribute to the nine wondrous acoustic effects produced by the pagoda.

The autumn wind blows the iron wind chimes hanging from the eaves, sounding like the jingling of Yingying's skirt ornaments. We arrived at the residence of the Cui family. This is a courtyard in the northern architectural style, consisting of three rooms. The three northern rooms were the residence of the Cui widow, the three western rooms were the residence of Yingying and Hongniang, and the three eastern rooms were the residence of Zhang Sheng. The stories of "First Sight," "Broken Engagement," and "The Red Beating" in "The Romance of the Western Chamber" are said to have taken place in this courtyard. According to the guide, during the restoration, a Jin Dynasty stone tablet was unearthed, inscribed with a poem by Wang Cu that laments Yingying: "The eastern wind blows through the quiet alleys, the sleeves and skirts change but cannot return. The cold geese sink into the depths of the message, for whom do the swallows return? The flowers fly in the small courtyard, the red sorrow follows, the spring is old in the western wing, locked in green moss. I fear that the returning soul will peek at Song Yu, the wall-eyed thief will secretly pity the talent."

　　普救寺小记
　　雷建德　毛志远
    因《西厢记》而闻名遐迩的普救寺，坐落在山西省永济县境内的峨嵋垣头，西临滔滔黄河水，南依巍巍中条山。寺中的莺莺塔是我国仅存四大古回音建筑之一，与意大利比萨斜塔等并称世界四大奇塔。
    普救寺始建于隋代，历经沧桑战乱，仅存莺莺塔、菩萨洞、石狮和几道石碑，使众多的中外游人牵肠挂肚，情趣锐减。经近年不断修葺，朱墙绿瓦的宝殿，幽深寂静的禅房，花荫满庭的西厢，又重映在游客的眼帘。
    循着剧中当年张生游西厢的路线，我们特意来到素有河东八景之称的“普救蟾声”的地方，用石块信手相击，便听到从莺莺塔中传出的蛙鸣声。传说，这蛙声是老夫人受到众人鞭笞后发出的忏悔声，以示后人再莫干棒打鸳鸯的蠢事。最近，莺莺塔的声学奥秘，已被有关专家揭开：特殊的地形地貌，特殊的建筑构造以及特殊的建筑材料，方使莺莺塔产生出９种奇妙的声学效应。
    秋风将檐前的铁马儿吹动，好似莺莺裙带上的环珮叮当。我们来到崔居别院。这是一座北方建筑风格的三合小院。３间北房是当年崔氏孀妇的居室，３间西厢房为莺莺和红娘的居室，３间东厢房为欢郎居室。《西厢记》中的“惊艳”、“赖婚”、“拷红”等故事据说都发生在院中。据导游者说，修复中还出土了一道金代《普救寺莺莺故居》的诗碣，上勒王促通凭吊莺莺的七律：“东风门巷日悠哉，翌袂云裾换不回。无据寒鸿沉信息，为谁江燕自归来。花飞小院愁红由，春老西厢锁绿苔。我恐返魂窥宋玉，墙头乱眼窃怜才。”
