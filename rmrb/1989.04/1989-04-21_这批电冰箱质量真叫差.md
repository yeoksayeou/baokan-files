This batch of refrigerators is truly of poor quality. Our department purchased thirty Dongfang-Zilowa refrigerators (first-grade products) from Huabei Industrial Company in December last year. Within a few days, more than ten units were sold. Most of these refrigerators have quality issues: some do not cool, some have unresponsive motors, some have cracked exteriors, and some have doors that do not seal properly. After selling them, customers demanded refunds. We sold some at a reduced price, but there are still five units that cannot be sold. We hope that the Dongfang-Zilowa Refrigerator Factory will pay attention to product quality.

　　这批电冰箱质量真叫差
    我部去年十二月从华北实业公司购进东方—齐洛瓦电冰箱三十台（一等品），几天就销售出十多台。这批冰箱大多存在质量问题，有的不制冷，有的电机启动不灵，有的外壳有裂口，有的箱门不严，售出后顾客要求退货。我们降价处理了一些，还存有五台卖不出去。望东方—齐洛瓦电冰箱总厂注意产品质量。
