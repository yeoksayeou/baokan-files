The Agricultural Bank of China began issuing its fourth round of financial bonds nationwide in April, totaling 1.4 billion yuan.

This issuance targets urban and rural individuals, with a term of one year. The bond interest rate is set 2 percentage points higher than the one-year fixed-term savings deposit rate, with principal and interest paid upon maturity.

There are two notable features of purchasing the Agricultural Bank's financial bonds this year: first, the term is relatively short; second, the bond interest rate is high. If the savings deposit interest rate is adjusted upward during the one-year period, the financial bond interest rate will also be adjusted upward by the same margin. The funds raised from the bond issuance will be fully used to support agriculture.

　　农行发行金融债券十四亿元
    本报讯　中国农业银行总行4月起在全国范围内公开发行第4期金融债券14亿元。
    这次发行对象面向城乡个人，期限规定为一年，债券利率在一年定期储蓄存款利率的基础上，上浮2个百分点，到期还本付息。
    购买今年农业银行发行的金融债券有2个明显特点：一是期限比较短。二是债券利率高。在1年期中，如果遇储蓄存款利率上调，则金融债券的利率也按同等幅度上调。发行债券筹集的资金，将全部用于支持农业。
