At around 3 AM on March 7, the public security bureau of Lishi County in Shanxi Province received a report from driver Yan Jicheng: his truck was robbed of four sacks of soybeans by thieves while passing through Qili Tan. Public security personnel quickly rushed to intercept the small three-wheeled vehicle transporting the stolen goods, capturing thieves Liu Taiping, Liu Xiaoning, and three others on the spot. Through a sudden search and interrogation, a major theft case involving 15 people, known as the "Highway Tigers," was solved. This gang of robbers had, over nearly a year, stolen grain, cassette players, coats, blankets, wool, liquor, and over fifty other items, valued at over 23,000 yuan.

These thieves were all residents of Qili Tan Village, with the oldest being 34 and the youngest 22.

Ghosts of Qili Tan

The Taiyuan-Suide Highway is a major road in Shanxi Province leading to Yulin and Yan'an in Shaanxi Province. The section of this highway near Qili Tan in Lishi County is about 5 kilometers long. Due to the widening of the road, the old surface has been removed, and the new surface has not been paved, making it a "bad road" with potholes and bumps, forcing vehicles to slow down. During the rainy season, the mud makes it difficult for vehicles to pass, often causing them to "break down." A group of lawless individuals from Qili Tan Village saw this as an opportunity to make money. Taking advantage of the darkness and the drivers' lack of vigilance, they would steal from the vehicles and throw the stolen goods by the roadside, with accomplices quickly moving them away. They operated in pairs or groups of three, almost without interruption since May of the previous year. Initially, the thieves were cautious, but later they became bolder. If they encountered each other on the road, they would exchange knowing glances and continue with their thefts.

This section of the road became haunted, turning into a "black road." Drivers transporting goods through here would insist that the owner accompany the vehicle, saying, "If you don't come with the vehicle, we won't compensate you if it gets stolen!"

Qili Tan became an ominous place. Drivers' wives would warn, "Be careful when passing through Qili Tan!" Some drivers would rather skip a trip than travel at night.

Turning a Blind Eye

In the past year, Lishi County's Chengguan Town's Qili Tan Village saw so many car thieves, and yet three public security officers lived in Qili Tan, but no one reported or provided any leads. The ringleader of the thieves, Liu Taiping, along with several others, had stolen from cars 45 times, becoming an expert in car theft. He stored the stolen cigarettes, cassette players, and clothing in the back room, and openly sold the stolen flour, soybeans, and green beans at low prices in the village. He would go out to steal at night, returning with muddy legs and feet, looking exhausted during the day... These signs were noticed by the villagers, but no one reported or exposed them.

"Why bother? It's not your stuff being stolen; it's public property on the road. What does it have to do with you or me? Why go looking for trouble," some people said.

Village head Xin Rude said, "Even if you report it, what good will it do? Stealing a few sacks of grain won't get you sentenced. You'll spend a few days in jail and come out. You'll offend someone, and the matter won't be settled. We can't even handle our own village affairs, let alone the road's. Everyone does their own thing; one day they'll be dealt with." This village head was full of complaints: "These days, what's the society like? Open robbery, secret theft, stabbing... Who dares to intervene? My brother-in-law bought a small four-wheeler in Wenxian County, and it was taken away by seven or eight ruffians without reason, demanding 60 yuan or else they wouldn't return the vehicle. This was reported, but there's been no news. There are similar incidents in the village. We turn a blind eye to them; the fewer we handle, the better. Handling too many won't end well!"

Drivers Cry Out "Difficult to Travel"

In Lvliang and Lishi, the reporter interviewed many drivers, and almost all of them said, "Driving is hard, maintaining the vehicle is hard, and traveling is hard." Lishi County's famous individual entrepreneur Feng Shuming has three trucks. Since the road widening project in Qili Tan started in 1988, his long-distance transport trucks have been repeatedly stolen from.

I asked him, "Your trucks have been stolen so many times, why didn't you report it?"

Feng Shuming said, "Report it? What good will it do! I'm a long-distance freight driver, and I can't say for sure where on the road the theft happened. Even if you report it, they won't take it seriously. There's open robbery, and you dare not provoke them. Reporting it will get you in trouble. Last March, I brought back a truckload of flour from Hebei. At 11 PM, while passing through Fenyang, I got off to eat, and a group of ruffians surrounded me, beating me up without a word. I quickly drove away to save myself. Fenyang has a 'cleaver squad' that specializes in stopping and robbing cars, which is terrifying."

After the Lishi County Public Security Bureau solved a car theft case, they issued a _Cooperation Inquiry Notice_ to more than 20 counties in Shaanxi Province on March 12, stating: "To quickly resolve this case and punish the criminals, please assist in inquiring about collective and individual truck transport units in your county. If there have been incidents of cargo theft in our county, please have the victims contact our criminal investigation team as soon as possible." However, more than a month has passed, and not a single victim from another province has come forward. According to the analysis, some victims think they have already suffered a "silent loss," and the round-trip travel expenses for retrieving the lost items are not worth it; some victims are afraid of provoking trouble and do not want to say anything; and some victims are transporting goods for the public, have already "covered it up," and are afraid of being punished and having to compensate. These are the attitudes of some victims.

During a discussion with the officials of the Lishi County Public Security Bureau, Director Zhang Xinghua frankly said: "Maintaining social order and protecting the people's peaceful lives is our duty. Currently, the social atmosphere in some places is so bad, which requires the joint efforts of all sectors of society and comprehensive governance. Now, public security personnel also have many concerns when handling cases. After all the trouble, there is no prosecution, no sentence, but instead, they provoke trouble. When something happens, the higher-ups investigate, and the people on the street complain. Public security personnel also have difficulties, hoping that higher authorities and media departments will support public security officers more."

　　“公路飞虎”覆灭记
    本报记者  王艾生
    ３月７日凌晨３时许，山西省离石县公安局接到司机阎吉成报案：他开的汽车路过七里滩时，被盗贼扒车窃走黄豆４麻袋。公安人员火速前去堵截运送赃物的小三轮车，当场抓获盗贼刘太平、刘小宁等五人。经过突击搜查、审讯，一举破获有１５人参加的被称为“公路飞虎”的扒车盗窃大案。这伙强盗，在近一年时间里，扒车盗窃粮食、收录机、大衣、毛毯、毛线、白酒等五十余种物品，价值２．３万余元。
    这伙盗贼，都是七里滩村村民，最大的３４岁，最小的２２岁。
    七里滩“鬼”影
    太（原）绥（德）公路是山西省通往陕西榆林、延安等地的干线。这条公路离离石县七里滩段，约有５公里左右，因拓宽路面，旧路面掀掉，新路面未铺，坑坑凹凹，成为“烂路”，汽车只得缓行。遇到雨季，泥泞不堪，汽车常常“抛锚”。七里滩村一帮不法分子，瞅准这个“发财”良机，乘夜深人静司机不备之机扒车盗窃，将窃得物品扔在路边，同伙当即转移。他们二人一伙，三人一团，从去年５月以来，几乎没有间断。盗贼们开始还鬼鬼祟祟，后来就不那么避人了。几个窃贼路上相遇，心照不宣，各干各的。
    这段公路“鬼”影绰绰，成为“黑道”，司机们运货过此，非要货主跟车不行，说：“你不跟车，被盗不赔！”
    七里滩成为不祥之地，司机出车，妻子叮咛：“过七里滩要小心！”有的宁肯少拉一趟，也不愿走夜路了。
    睁一只眼闭一只眼
    离石县城关镇七里滩村，在近一年时间里出现这么多扒车贼，而且还有３名公安干警的家住在七里滩，竟没有人报案或提供线索。盗贼中为首的刘太平，同数人合伙扒车盗窃４５次，成了扒车行家。他盗取的香烟、录音机、衣物堆放在后窑里，还大模大样地把盗来的白面、黄豆、绿豆……低价在本村出售。他深夜扒车，泥腿泥脚，白天显得疲惫不堪……这些迹象，村里人早有察觉，但是，谁也不去报案、揭发。
    “何苦呢，又不是偷你的，他是偷公路上的，公家的，与你与我有啥关系，何必去惹麻烦。”一些人这样说。
    村长辛如德说：“你报了案，又能怎样？偷了几袋粮食，也判不了刑，蹲上几天出来，人你得罪了，事也没有完。自己村里事都管不过来，还管公路上的事。个人做事个人当，总有一天会收拾他们。”这位村长满腹怨气：“这阵，社会风气还像个啥样！？明抢，暗偷，捅刀子……谁敢管。我小舅子在文水县买台小四轮，凭白无故被七八个赖小子拉走，非要六十元，不然不给车。这倒报了案，至今无音讯。村上这类事，睁一只眼闭一只眼，能不管就不管，管多了没有好下场！”
    司机呼吁“行路难”
    在吕梁，在离石，记者访问了不少司机，几乎都异口同声说：“开车难，养车难，行路难”。离石县著名的个体户冯树明有卡车三辆，从１９８８年七里滩公路拓宽工程开工以来，他的拉脚运输车接二连三被盗。
    我问他：“你的车被盗这么多次，为什么不去报案？”
    冯树明说：“报案，报案顶啥用！我是长途货运，咱说不准在哪段路上被盗的。你就是报了案，人家也不当回事，有的是明抢哩，你敢惹？报了案，关上几天出来，够你喝一壶的。去年３月，我从河北拉回一车白面，晚上１１点，路经汾阳，下车吃饭，一帮赖鬼围上来，二话不说就大打出手，我赶紧开车逃命。汾阳有个‘菜刀队’，专门拦车打劫，令人害怕。”
    离石县公安局破获一扒车盗窃案后，曾于３月１２日向陕西省的２０多个县的公安部门发出《协查通报》，说：“为尽快落实此案，惩办罪犯，请协助查询你县所属集体、个体汽车运输户，如有在我县境内发生货物被盗的，请让失主及时与我局刑警队联系。”但是，时间已过去一个多月，竟没有一个外省失主找上门来。据析，有的失主认为已吃“哑巴亏”，去领丢失的物品往返路费划不来；有的失主则怕惹下恶人，不愿再说；还有的失主是为公家拉货，已“胡弄”过去，怕再弄出来受罚要赔。这就是失主们的一些心态。
    在同离石县公安局同志座谈时，局长张兴华直率地说：“维护社会治安，保护人民安居乐业，是我们的天职。当前，一些地方社会风气这么坏，这要靠社会各界共同努力，靠综合治理。现在公安人员办案也顾虑重重，折腾了半天，不起诉，不判刑，反倒惹下人。出了事上面追查，老百姓也骂街。公安人员也有难处，希望上级和舆论部门多为公安干警撑腰。”
