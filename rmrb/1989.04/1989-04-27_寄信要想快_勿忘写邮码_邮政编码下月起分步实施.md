To ensure fast mail delivery, don't forget to write the postal code. The postal code system will be implemented in stages starting next month.

		Our reporter Gao Xinqing and Zhang Yan report from Beijing: The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications today once again reminded people to write the postal code when sending mail. To promote the modernization and informatization of mail delivery, postal departments will start implementing the postal code system in urban and rural areas across the country in stages starting next month.

		It is understood that the specific implementation schedule is as follows: The first stage, from May this year to April 1990, requires all users nationwide to write the sender's postal code; the second stage, starting from May 1990, requires all users nationwide to write both the sender's and recipient's "double codes." To adapt to the needs of machine automatic sorting, the envelopes will also be standardized. After January 1, 1992, the post office will no longer accept non-standard letters.

		With the rapid development of the commodity economy, the volume of mail in China has been continuously growing at a high speed. Last year, the total number of letters nationwide reached 5.97 billion, an increase of 9.1% over the previous year, averaging 5.4 letters per person. This puts a lot of pressure on the postal department, and writing postal codes is an effective way to speed up delivery. Since 1980, continuous publicity has led more and more people to recognize the benefits of writing postal codes. Taking Beijing as an example, more than 80% of the mail last year had the sender's postal code filled in.

		To provide convenience for filling in the recipient's postal code, the postal department has published the "China Postal Code Atlas." The first volume of the 8-volume "China Postal Code Complete Set," the "Party and Government Agencies Volume," has also started official distribution. Some city telephone exchanges have also set up postal code inquiry services. Today, relevant officials from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications solemnly suggested: All advertisements, publications, manuals, and name cards that require the address and contact information to be indicated should not forget to include the postal code.

　　寄信要想快　勿忘写邮码    
    邮政编码下月起分步实施
    本报北京４月２７日讯  记者高新庆、张砚报道：邮电部今天再次提醒人们，寄信时不要忘记写邮政编码。为促进邮件传递的信息化、现代化，邮电部门将从下月起在全国城乡分步实施邮政编码。
    据悉，具体分步实施的时间是：第一步，从今年５月到１９９０年４月，要求全国用户书写寄信人编码；第二步，从１９９０年５月起，要求全国用户书写寄信人和收信人“双码”。为适应机器自动分拣的需要，要求信封也实行标准化。１９９２年１月１日后，邮局将不再收寄不标准的信件。
    随着商品经济的迅猛发展，我国邮件业务量持续高速增长。去年全国函件达５９．７亿件，比上年增长９．１％，平均每人寄信５．４件。这对邮政部门压力很大，而书写邮码是加快投递的有效办法。由于１９８０年以来的不断的宣传，越来越多的人认识到写邮码的好处，以北京为例，去年有８０％以上的邮件填写了寄信人的邮码。
    为了给填写收件人邮码提供方便，邮电部门已出版了《中国邮政编码图集》。８卷本《中国邮政编码大全》第一卷《党政机关卷》也开始正式发行。一些城市电话局还开办了邮码查询台。邮电部有关负责人今天郑重建议：凡需标明地址和通讯联系的广告、刊物、说明书以及名片，都别忘了写上邮政编码。
