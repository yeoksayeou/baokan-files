The "Vegetable Basket Project" should be undertaken within one's capabilities, focusing on practical results, and should not be rushed or expanded indiscriminately. A meeting of agricultural banks from 19 major cities, including Shanghai and Guangzhou, which concluded today in Guangzhou, issued this appeal.

Delegates at the meeting reported that because the "Vegetable Basket Project" is crucial for increasing supply and stabilizing prices, local governments have paid great attention to it and are urgently deploying its implementation. However, in the process of implementation, various places are eager to start projects quickly, leading to a large number of projects and concentrated timelines. The construction front is too long, and the funding gap is particularly prominent. In a certain city in East China, the funding gap for the construction of subsidiary food bases last year was as high as 100 million yuan compared to the planned investment for construction projects. This year, it is estimated that the city's funding sources will only maintain the level of 230 million yuan from last year, of which only 50 million yuan can be used for new projects, while the several new projects already planned for construction require an investment of 385 million yuan.

The delegates believe that even good deeds should follow economic laws and be undertaken within one's capabilities. In the context of the state tightening fiscal and credit policies, it is necessary to prevent the expansion of projects and the prolongation of the construction front. It is important to concentrate material and financial resources to fight decisive battles, striving to make each project achieve minimal investment, maximum output, and quick results.

　　“菜篮子工程”要量力而行
    战线拉得太长资金缺口突出  农行专家呼吁防止铺大摊子
    新华社广州４月４日电  （记者江佐中、通讯员梁贤杰）“菜篮子工程”建设也要量力而行，讲求实效，不可一哄而上、铺大摊子，“寅吃卯粮”。今天在此间结束的上海、广州等１９个大中城市农业银行研讨会发出了这样的呼吁。
    与会代表反映，由于“菜篮子工程”对增加供给、平抑物价至关重要，各地政府都相当重视，抓紧部署实施。但在实施过程中，各地急切要求早上快上，致使上马项目数量多、时间集中，基建战线拉得太长，资金缺口十分突出。华东某市去年副食品基地建设的资金来源与计划安排项目的基建投资总额相比，缺口高达１亿元；今年预计这个市的资金来源仅能保持去年２．３亿元的水平，其中可供新上项目使用的资金仅０．５亿元，而已计划建设的几个新项目就需投资３．８５亿元。
    代表们认为，办好事也应遵循经济规律，量力而行。在国家收紧财政信贷的情况下，要防止铺大摊子、拉长战线，要坚持集中物力、财力打歼灭战，力争每个项目做到投入少、产出多、收效快。
