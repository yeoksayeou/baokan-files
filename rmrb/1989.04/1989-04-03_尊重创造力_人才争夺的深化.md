Currently, not only developing countries but also Japan and some developed countries in Western Europe are worried about the loss of scientific and technological talent. So, where exactly has this "spring water" flowed to? It has mainly flowed to the United States. Since the end of the war, the United States has focused on attracting foreign talent to improve its own scientific and technological level. In just the 15 years from the mid-1960s to the early 1980s, 630,000 professional technical workers and similar personnel entered the United States. Now, nearly a thousand outstanding scientific and technological talents leave the UK for the United States each year. The number of Japanese scientific and technological personnel immigrating to the United States is also increasing year by year.

Why does the United States have such a strong attraction? Apart from first-class equipment and generous salaries, the most important factor is that the United States has a research environment that allows scientific and technological personnel to showcase their talents and creativity. In the United States, young people are rarely hindered by hierarchy and seniority, and can independently conduct research projects, producing results by the age of 30 or 40. In Japan, however, due to the emphasis on collective cooperation and seniority, the creativity of scientific and technological personnel is often not easily realized. The outdated scientific and technological systems and aging workforce in countries like the UK and France make some creative talents feel that their innovative spirit is suppressed, leading them to flow towards the United States.

Currently, with the rapid development of high technology, the issue of talent is becoming increasingly prominent. Therefore, whether it is developed countries or developing countries, they are all striving to retain and attract talent. One of their policy directions is to create an environment that is conducive to the development of creativity. This trend poses a challenge to the United States' advantage in attracting talent. Japan is making a strong push, aiming to transition from a "catch-up" model to a "creative" one. It is changing its relatively conservative traditions and plans to recruit talented individuals from both domestic and international sources to establish corresponding institutions. The famous Japanese Institute of Physical and Chemical Research plans to publicly recruit researchers in their 20s and 30s from both domestic and international sources, allowing them to conduct original research, and to allocate funds to establish a special visiting researcher system for basic science. The UK, France, and South Korea are also actively adjusting their scientific and technological policies to create a flexible, relaxed, and diversified research environment to mobilize the creative potential of scientific and technological personnel. Some developing countries have also formulated "returning talent to their homeland" emergency plans. However, they mostly still focus on economic means, and their financial resources are quite limited, so they will not pose a significant threat to the United States.

Facing the offensive from various countries, the United States has developed a sense of urgency. To maintain its advantage in the talent contest, the United States has begun to seriously study the topic of "managing creativity." Researchers have proposed the most effective ways to tap into creativity from various angles, such as the psychological factors, personalities of scientific and technological personnel, and how management departments evaluate the value of creative labor. Most people believe that for scientific and technological personnel, it is only necessary to point out the peak that must be climbed, without specifying the path to reach there.

The research by the United States and the measures taken by some countries to mobilize the creativity of scientific and technological personnel will further deepen the global talent contest, shifting from mainly focusing on economic means to emphasizing the important lever of respecting creativity in the contest for talent.

　　尊重创造力
    ——人才争夺的深化
    木雅
    目前，不仅发展中国家，连日本和西欧一些发达国家，也在为科技人才的流失而忧虑。那么，这“一江春水”究竟流向了何方？主要是流向美国。美国自战后起就注重吸收国外人才以提高本国的科技水平。仅６０年代中期到８０年代初期的１５年中，进入美国的专业技术和同类工作者就达６３万。现在，英国每年有近千名优秀科技人才流往美国。日本移居美国的科技人员也在逐年增多。
    美国为什么有这么大的吸引力？除了一流的设备和丰厚的薪金外，更重要的是美国具有一种让科技人员施展才华、发挥其独创性的科研环境。在美国，年轻人很少受等级和资历的困扰，可以独立从事课题研究，到三四十岁就能出成果。日本则由于强调集体协作，且论资排辈，科技人员的独创性往往不易得到发挥。英国和法国等西欧国家科技体制陈旧，队伍老化，使一些有创造才能的人感到创新精神受到压抑而流向美国。
    当前，高科技迅速发展，人才问题日渐突出。所以，无论是发达国家还是发展中国家都在为保住人才和吸收人才而努力。其政策方向之一是设法创造一个有利于发挥独创性的科研环境。这一形势是对美国吸引人才优势的挑战。日本气势逼人，它为了从“追赶型”转为“创造型”，正在改变较为保守的传统，准备广集人才并建立相应的制度。著名的日本理化学研究所打算在国内外公开招收二三十岁的科研人员，让他们进行独创性研究，并拨款设立基础科学特邀研究员制度。英国、法国及南朝鲜也在积极调整科技政策，以便创造一种灵活、宽松、多样化的科研环境，以调动科技人员的创造潜力。一些发展中国家也制定了“使人才返回故里”的紧急计划。不过，它们多半还是只重视经济手段，而其财力又十分有限，所以不会对美国构成太大的威胁。
    在各国的攻势面前，美国产生了紧迫感。为了在人才争夺战中继续保持优势，美国已经把“管理创造力”作为一个新的课题认真研究。研究者从科技人员的心理因素、个性、管理部门如何评价创造性劳动的价值等多种角度提出了最有效地发掘创造力的见解。多数人认为，对科技人员只需指出必须攀登的山峰，而不必具体规定到达那里的途径。
    美国的研究以及一些国家开始采取措施调动科技人员的独创性，将使世界范围的人才争夺进一步深化，即从主要重视经济手段等转向抓住尊重创造力这个争夺人才的重要杠杆。
