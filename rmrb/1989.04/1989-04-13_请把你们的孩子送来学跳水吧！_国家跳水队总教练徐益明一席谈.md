Inside the Guangzhou Tianhe Sports Center Swimming Hall, the 1989 Chinese Diving Open was in full swing. Olympic champions Xu Yanmei and Gao Min showcased their skills, captivating the audience in Guangzhou, who cheered and applauded enthusiastically.

In a quiet room backstage, the reporter found Xu Yiming, the head coach of the Chinese Diving Team, sitting with a worried expression, deep in thought. The "general" who had returned triumphant from the Olympics seemed to have something weighing heavily on his mind. Xu Yiming shared his deep concerns.

"At the Olympics, we won 2 golds, 3 silvers, and 1 bronze, which was a great achievement. Colleagues in the sports community said, 'Now your life will be easier.' The general public also thought that the diving world was thriving. However, as the head coach, I am deeply worried: our reserve talent pool is severely lacking. If we do not solve this problem, it will be difficult for China's diving to maintain a high level, and the situation is not optimistic!"

"On the day after we returned from Seoul, I rushed to Wuhan. Why? To find new talent. I am very clear that diving is a sport where talent turnover is rapid. If we had not found a new group of athletes like Xu Yanmei and Gao Min after the Los Angeles Olympics, we would not have had such good results this time. The same logic applies: if we do not find new talent now, there will be no hope for the Barcelona Olympics."

"Over the past few months, I have traveled extensively, visiting many places, but I have not found many good prospects. Our reserve talent pool is pitifully small. To be honest, if I can find 3 boys and 3 girls this year, I will be grateful. As the head coach, how can I not be anxious? How can I not feel a sense of crisis? We have less than 200 athletes in our first-team, and the amateur sports schools have only about 300 students. There are only 9 diving pools nationwide, and many children can only train outdoors in borrowed venues. With just a few hundred people trying to achieve world-class standards, do you think it's difficult? The problem of national strength is temporarily unsolvable, but I ask you reporters to write articles to help us appeal, to tell the truth to everyone, and to ask them to quickly send their children to learn diving. Otherwise, China's diving advantage will be hard to maintain."

"Someone asked me about the secret of the Chinese Diving Team's success, and I summarized it into two points: hard work and scientific training. Indeed, after years of exploration and practice, we have mastered a very advanced set of scientific training methods. As long as there are good prospects, we have the ability to create one world champion after another. I am 46 years old now, and my prime years are not many. But I have set a grand goal for myself: to bring back all the medals from the Olympics, World Cup, and World Championships in the next 8 to 12 years. But 'a skilled woman cannot cook without rice,' our traditional strong projects like volleyball, gymnastics, and table tennis are gradually losing their advantages, and one of the important reasons is the severe lack of reserve talent."

"Finally, I once again ask the reporters to help me appeal to the people of the nation: to ensure that diving does not lack successors, please send your children to learn diving!"

　　“请把你们的孩子送来学跳水吧！”
　　——国家跳水队总教练徐益明一席谈
    广州天河体育中心游泳馆内，1989年中国跳水公开赛激战正酣。奥运会冠军许艳梅、高敏再展英姿，看得羊城观众如醉如痴，掌声、喝彩声如雷鸣。
    记者在后场一间冷清清的屋子里找到了满面愁云，陷入沉思的中国跳水队总教练徐益明。从奥运会上凯旋而归的“将军”难道还有什么不如人意？徐益明倒出了自己的满腹忧虑。
    “奥运会上，我们拿了2金3银1铜，成绩不错。体育界同仁都说：‘这下子你的日子好过了’。广大观众也以为，跳水界形势大好，可人们却不知道，作为总教练，我忧心如焚：后备力量严重匮乏。如不解决这个问题，我国跳水运动很难维持高水平，形势不容乐观啊！”
      “从汉城回国的第二天，我就日夜兼程赶到武汉。干什么去呢？找苗子。我心里很清楚，跳水这个项目人才更新换代很快，如果当初洛杉矶奥运会后我们不去找许艳梅、高敏等一批新人，就没有这次奥运会的好成绩，道理一样，如果现在我们找不到新的好苗子，巴塞罗那奥运会就没有指望。”
      “这几个月，我走南闯北，去了许多地方，也没有发现几个好苗子，后备力量少得可怜。不瞒你们说，今年我要能物色到3男3女就已经谢天谢地了。作为总教练，我能不着急？能没有危机感？我们一线队员不足200人，业余体校的学生也不过300人，全国仅有9个跳水馆，许多孩子都只能借别的场地在露天训练。就靠这几百人搞世界水平，你们说困难不困难？属于国力上的问题暂时无法解决，可是我请你们记者赶紧写文章替我们呼吁，把真实情况告诉大家，请他们赶快把孩子送来学跳水。不然，我国跳水运动的优势将很难保持下去。”
      “有人问我中国跳水队成功的秘诀何在，我归纳了两点：艰苦奋斗加科学训练。的确，经过多年的探索和实践，我们已经掌握了一整套十分先进的科学训练方法，只要有好苗子，我们有能力造就一个又一个世界冠军。我今年46岁，年富力强的日子已不太多，可我为自己确定了一个远大目标，就是在8—12年内把奥运会、世界杯赛和世界锦标赛的所有牌子都拿回来。可‘巧妇难为无米之炊’，我们的传统优势项目如排球、体操、乒乓球等逐渐失去优势，其中一个很重要的原因就是后备力量严重不足。”
      “最后我再一次请记者替我向全国人民呼吁：为了使跳水运动不致后继乏人，请把您们的孩子送来学跳水吧！”
