Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, April 29th.

The leaders of the three factions of the Democratic Kampuchea held a special meeting yesterday. They reaffirmed that the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops must be supervised by the United Nations; demanded that Vietnam withdraw all illegal immigrants; and condemned Hun Sen's recent proposal for so-called "general elections" by his puppet government.

The meeting issued a joint statement saying that this special meeting was convened under the chairmanship of Prince Sihanouk, the chairman of the Democratic Kampuchea. The leaders of the three factions discussed the situation of the struggle of the Kampuchean people, supported by all peace-loving and just countries in the world, to restore national independence and freedom and to resist Vietnamese invasion and colonization. The meeting congratulated all patriotic soldiers and people of Kampuchea for their unity and cooperation in the past ten years in their heroic struggle against Vietnamese colonialists and called on the soldiers of the "Phnom Penh regime" to join the national resistance forces to save their country.

The statement said, "The national resistance forces of Kampuchea will not believe that Vietnam will end its occupation and colonization of Kampuchea by September 30, 1989, unless Vietnam 'withdraws troops' and the United Nations or the United Nations Security Council supervises and verifies it."

"We demand that all Vietnamese illegal immigrants return to Vietnam."

The statement pointed out that the national resistance forces of Kampuchea condemn Hun Sen's recent proposal for so-called "general elections" organized by his illegal "People's Republic of Kampuchea." Since the "general elections" are not controlled by the United Nations but are organized by the illegal "People's Republic of Kampuchea" under Vietnamese colonial rule, they can only be a ridiculous and deceptive farce.

　　民柬三方领导人举行特别会议    
    要求越南撤走非法移民    
    谴责柬伪政权的“普选”
    本报曼谷４月２９日电  记者刘爱成报道，民柬三方领导人昨晚在这里举行特别会议，重申越南撤军必须由联合国监督；要求越南撤回所有非法移民；谴责洪森最近提出的所谓由其伪政权组织“普选”。
    会议发表联合声明说，这次特别会议是由民柬主席西哈努克亲王主持下召开的。会上三方领导人讨论了“在世界所有爱好和平和正义国家支持下柬人民为恢复国家独立和自由，反击越南侵略和殖民化的斗争形势。会议对所有柬埔寨爱国战士和人民在过去十年中团结合作，英勇反击越南殖民主义者的斗争表示祝贺，呼吁‘金边政权’士兵与柬民族抵抗力量一道来挽救自己的国家。”
    声明说，“柬民族抵抗力量将不会相信越南会在１９８９年９月３０日结束对柬埔寨的侵占和殖民化，除非越南‘撤军’并由联合国或联合国安理会进行监督和核实。”
    “我们要求所有的越南非法移民返回越南。”
    声明指出，柬埔寨民族抵抗力量谴责洪森最近提出的由其非法的“柬埔寨人民共和国”组织所谓的“普选”。由于“普选”不是由联合国控制而是在越南殖民主义统治下由非法的“柬埔寨人民共和国”组织进行的，因此，只能是可笑的骗人把戏。
