Our prefecture is located in the western mountainous region of Hunan, where the economy is relatively backward, and criminal cases frequently occur. The procuratorate bears a very heavy workload. However, issues such as insufficient funds and outdated equipment have created significant difficulties for the procuratorate's work. The former Dayong City Procuratorate, which was part of our prefecture, once had to suspend operations in the financial department due to severe financial shortages. The colleagues in our bureau's discipline inspection department could not go to the grassroots level due to lack of funds and had to stay in the office all year round, issuing instructions remotely. In the fourth quarter of last year, all the cadres of the Fenghuang County Procuratorate in our prefecture each contributed 2,000 yuan for case handling funds, allowing several major cases to be closed. The Baojing County Procuratorate in our prefecture has 39 cadres, and their main equipment consists of only one old Beijing-brand jeep and a broken camera.

　　经费不足装备落后　检察院工作困难多
    我州地处湖南西部山区，经济比较落后，犯罪案件时有发生，检察机关担负着十分繁重的任务。但是，经费不足，装备落后等问题，给检察机关的工作造成很大困难。我州原所属的大庸市检察院曾因经费奇缺，财务室一度停止办公。我院法纪检察科的同志因缺经费无法下基层，只得终年呆在办公室里“遥控”指挥。去年第四季度，我州凤凰县检察院全体干警每人集资2000元办案经费，才使几件重大案件结案。我州保靖县检察院有干警39人，主要装备只有一辆旧北京牌吉普车和一架坏了的照相机。湖南湘西土家族苗族自治州
