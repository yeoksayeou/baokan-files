Singing is a three-dimensional art — Remembering the 1988 Golden Star, Su Hong
Peng Li

	With a powerful and bright voice, and a pure, sweet tone, Su Hong's rendition of "Yellow Earth Ridge" intoxicated the city of springs. At the end of last year, in the largest sports stadium in Shandong Province, she ascended the stage in a vibrant long dress, elegant and graceful.

	Su Hong was born in Wuhan in 1961. The slow-flowing waters of the Yangtze River, like a loving mother, sang lullabies to her. In the lush green nursery of the Air Force Kindergarten, there was often a little girl who resembled a doll, singing spontaneously. Her voice, like her faithful shadow, followed her wherever she went. Her first song was "Little Swallow." As cheerful as a swallow, Su Hong often performed with her sister on stage. At the age of 15, she joined the Benxi City Song and Dance Troupe, beginning her long singing career.

	Su Hong has a unique way of looking at life: she always thinks positively. Is it because of her sweet doll-like face, or her petite figure? In any case, she was well-received by audiences when she performed in operas with adults. Over 12 years, she played roles in 14 operas, including "Jiang Jie" and "Xiao Erhei Gets Married," performing hundreds of times.

	In the late 1970s, pop music swept across mainland China. Many of Su Hong's fans wrote to her, suggesting she sing pop songs. Su Hong was deeply moved and thought: Why does Teresa Teng's pop songs sound so natural, like talking to a friend? Isn't this also an artistic realm? People might say that professional singers of Western classical music can easily switch to singing popular songs. But it's not that simple. It's like learning a new language; changing your accustomed pronunciation is no easy task. Gu Jianfen's pop singing training class provided Su Hong with an excellent opportunity. Out of over 2,000 applicants, only four were selected, and Su Hong was one of the lucky ones. Courses in music theory, literary appreciation, English, body movement, and piano broadened her artistic horizons. She finally realized that singing is a three-dimensional art, and an excellent singer should have a wide range of knowledge and cultivation.

	Songs are made famous by singers, and singers are made famous by songs. In the 1986 National Youth Singer Television Awards, Su Hong won first place in the pop singing category with her original songs "March 3rd" and "I Really Want to Sing." Soon after, her song "Little Me" also captivated a wide audience. In 1987, she was named one of the nation's favorite singers. Her five albums, including "When I Miss You," were also released. Despite experiencing failures and setbacks in life, on stage, flowers and applause were always generous to her. Perhaps it was her optimistic nature that brought her good fortune, who knows?

　　歌唱是立体的艺术
　　——记１９８８年金星苏红
　　彭俐
    嗓音高亢明亮，音色纯净甜美。苏红演唱的一曲《黄土高坡》，像一杯美酒灌醉了泉城——去年岁末，在山东省最大的体育馆里，她身穿鲜艳长裙，仪态万方地走上舞台。
    １９６１年，苏红出生武汉。那缓缓流淌的扬子江水，慈母一般，为她唱着催眠曲。在空军幼儿园嫩绿的草毡上，常有一位洋娃娃似的小姑娘，情不自禁地吟唱着。歌声像自己忠实的影子，她走到哪里，歌声就跟到哪里。她学唱的第一首歌是《小燕子》。快活得像小燕子的苏红，经常和姐姐登台表演。１５岁进入本溪市歌舞团，开始了她漫长的演唱生涯。
    遇事爱往好处想，这是苏红特有的生活逻辑。是因为她甜美的娃娃脸，还是因为小巧玲珑的身材？总之，她在同成年人合作的歌剧中，颇受观众的青睐。１２年间，她在《江姐》、《小二黑结婚》等１４部歌剧中担任角色，演出了数百场。
    ７０年代后期，流行歌曲吹向中国大陆。许多关心苏红的观众殷勤致函，建议她演唱流行歌曲。苏红欣然动容，想：为什么邓丽君演唱的流行歌曲，像说话一样自然，像与朋友交谈一样亲切，这不也是一种艺术境界吗！人们也许会说，唱美声的专业演员改唱通俗歌曲是轻而易举的事。其实不然，好比学外语，要改变习惯了的发音方法谈何容易。谷建芬的通俗唱法培训班，给了苏红绝好的机会。两千多名报考者中，仅有四人被选中，苏红是幸运儿。音乐理论、文学欣赏、英语、形体、钢琴等课程，开阔了她的艺术视野。她终于悟出了，歌唱是立体的艺术，一位优秀歌手，要具有多方面知识和修养。
    歌曲因歌手而传唱，歌手因歌曲而扬名。１９８６年全国青年歌手电视大奖赛中，苏红以创作歌曲《三月三》和《我多想唱》荣获通俗唱法专业组第一名。紧接着，她那首《小小的我》又征服了广大听众。１９８７年，她被评为全国听众喜爱的歌唱演员。她的《想你的时候》等五盘专辑磁带也相继问世。尽管生活中有过失败挫折，但在舞台上，鲜花和掌声对她总是那么慷慨。或许是生性乐观给她带来好运，谁知道呢？
