Title: Life in the Mountains is Full of Regrets

Two things happened in the mountains. The first is that my childhood friend, Yàguāng, who used to have a shaved head like a crescent moon and played naked in the fishpond with me, has come out of the mountain valley to open a small eatery. Although he doesn't make much money, his business is still quite good. The second is that my childhood friend, Jīnhuā, who once played the role of my bride, wanted to get out of the mountain nook to see the outside world, but ended up being tricked and sold to Hubei, becoming the "woman" of a nearly fifty-year-old ugly old man.

After I started working, I had a different life outside the mountains, but every so often I would still go back to visit my childhood friends. The mountain streams still flow, the wildflowers still bloom, and the shallow fishponds still have naked children jumping into them...

One time, Yàguāng killed a chicken and invited me to dinner. The chicken was originally kept to lay eggs and exchange for some school supplies for the kids, but tonight it was killed to treat me, so he must have something to ask of me. Sure enough, during the meal, Yàguāng, with a red face, said he wanted to borrow some money from me. He went to Guangzhou with his uncle, opened his eyes, and wanted to make big money. Yàguāng has improved, dragging his children to temporarily set up a nest outside the mountains, and he doesn't want his children to follow in the footsteps of their ancestors.

During this time, the mountains also underwent some changes. However, I could no longer return to the mountains as I used to. I was afraid because my friends always asked me many questions that I couldn't explain clearly, but which did exist, such as why the city people's lives changed and changed again, but the mountains remained the same, with not even one movie a year, and not even a traveling theater troupe coming to perform. Is it because they are afraid of not having money to give them? Why was the most beautiful and intelligent girl in the village tricked into being someone's wife for over a hundred days, and now, is there really no law, can't it be managed?...

The more they asked, the more I answered, but I couldn't solve anything, so I got tired of it and didn't want to go back anymore.

I once, as a representative, took a report from the mountain people requesting assistance to build a direct road to the outside of the mountains to a county road bureau chief. The bureau chief said he would consider it. After half a year, I went to see how things were, and the bureau chief had been promoted and transferred away. The new bureau chief said he hadn't seen the report.

Half a year passed, another half year passed... I no longer went to ask, and I didn't dare go back to the mountains anymore. I was afraid of losing face in front of my fellow villagers. Although they asked me to convey to the road bureau chief that if he could help build the road to the mountains, he could have whatever he wanted...

Things are like this, vague and unclear. I seem to have gained nothing and lost nothing, but every time I sit and think about it after meals, I always have an indescribable feeling. Occasionally, when I hear some singer singing "The Outside World," a line says: The outside world is so wonderful, the outside world is so helpless. I, however, think: The outside world is wonderful, but life in the mountains is full of regrets... The song is sung like this, but people can't live like this forever.

### 山里的生活很无奈

　　山里的生活很无奈
    阮启枝
    山里出了两件事。一是儿时那剃了“月亮”头、光着屁股拉我跳入鱼塘的亚光，从山沟沟里跑出来开了一家小吃店，虽眼下赚不了大钱，生意却还算好。二是在儿时扮过我新娘子的金花，因要钻出山旮旯，游一游外面的世界，结果让人拐骗，卖到了湖北，给一个近五十岁的丑老头当了“女人”。
    我参加工作后，在山外有了另一种生活天地，但每隔一段时间还要回一趟山里去看看儿时的伙伴。山里的溪水依旧流，遍野的花草照时长，浅鱼塘边上仍有光屁股的孩子往下跳……
    有一回，亚光杀了鸡喊我去吃饭。这鸡原本是留着下蛋换些孩子的作业本的，今晚杀了请我吃，想必有事要我帮忙。果然席间亚光红着脸说要跟我借点钱。他跟姑父去了一趟广州，开了眼，要赚大钱去。亚光出息了，拖儿带女在山外临时安了个窝，他不想让儿女踩着祖先的后脚跟走下去。
    这期间，山里也有了变化。我却不能跟往常一样回山里了。我怕，因为伙伴们总是提出许多使我无法解释清楚，确实又存在的问题，诸如怎么城里人生活变了又变，我们山里却跟以往一样，一年到头看不上一场电影，连唱戏的也不来演，是怕没钱给他们？为什么村里最耐看、最聪明的姑娘让人骗去当了一百来天的老婆，现在还有没有王法，真的管不了吗？……问的多了，我也答多了，就是解决不了，所以腻了，不愿再回去了。
    我曾作为代表，拿着一份山里人关于要求资助修一条直通山外公路的报告去找县里管公路的一位局长，那局长说考虑考虑。过了半年，我去看个究竟，那局长高升调走了，新局长说他没看到那份报告。
    过了半年，又过了半年……我不再去找了，也不敢再回到山里去，我怕在乡亲们面前丢脸。尽管他们要我转告那位管公路的局长，如果他能帮助修通山里的公路，他要什么给什么……
    事情就是这样稀里糊涂，我似乎没得到什么，也没失去什么，只是每当茶余饭后闲坐想起这些，心中总有一种说不出的感慨，偶尔听到不知哪位歌星唱的《外面的世界》，一句歌词说：外面的世界真精彩，外面的世界很无奈，我却想成：外面的世界很精彩，山里的生活很无奈……。歌是这么唱，人可是不能老这样子生活呀。
