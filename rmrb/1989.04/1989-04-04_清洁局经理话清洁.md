The manager of the cleaning department of Rome, the capital of Italy, Mr. Molinas, recently accepted an interview with our reporter and introduced the city's methods of handling garbage.

According to statistics, in 1987, Italy produced over 17 million tons of urban garbage. The composition of garbage varies by region, and so do the methods of disposal. The main methods are landfilling and incineration. Some cities are gradually implementing and expanding the practice of classified collection and waste utilization. Molinas said that the main methods Rome uses to collect and dispose of garbage are as follows:

1. Unified planning, zonal management. Rome has both densely populated ancient city areas and newly developed areas with wide roads, as well as the "Seven Hills" with varying elevations. Each area has different environmental characteristics, so the city is divided into 50 zones for separate management. Starting in 1982, except for the ancient city center where the landscape must be preserved, 60,000 garbage bins have been placed in other areas. The cleaning department has over 400 garbage trucks operating in three shifts—morning, afternoon, and night—to collect and transport garbage, achieving the goal of daily production and daily clearance. Additionally, starting this spring, 60 high-pressure cleaning trucks will be used to clean the streets.

2. General garbage is landfilled, toxic garbage is incinerated. The Malagrotta garbage station west of Rome was originally an abandoned quarry with anti-seepage functions. The cleaning department has treated the 5-kilometer perimeter with anti-seepage measures, making it an ideal garbage station. Compactors compress the garbage delivered, cover it with a layer of soil, and isolate it from the air, achieving harmless treatment. It is reported that the processing capacity of this garbage station alone is sufficient for Rome until 2005. The law stipulates that medical waste must be incinerated and cannot be mixed with other garbage. Violators will face criminal charges.

3. Classified collection, emphasis on recycling. Classified collection has been implemented in Italy for several years. In 1987, Italy recycled over 400,000 tons of glass and reused it 100%. Some glass factories use 80% recycled glass as raw materials. Rome has also placed battery collection containers in over 400 schools and set up collection boxes for expired medicines in over 800 pharmacies.

Currently, Rome is researching the use of organic materials from garbage to produce high-quality organic fertilizers and is exploring ways to use waste fuel for power generation and heating. At the end of the interview, Molinas said, "The treatment of urban garbage has entered the high-tech era from the era of a single broom, and there are still many problems waiting to be solved."

　　清洁局经理话清洁
    本报记者  史克栋
    意大利首都罗马市清洁局总经理莫利纳斯在不久前接受记者采访时介绍了该市处理垃圾的做法。
    据统计，１９８７年意大利生产城市垃圾１７００多万吨。各地的垃圾成份不同，处理方法也不一样，主要采用填埋法和焚烧法。分类收集，废物利用正在一些城市逐步实施、扩大。莫利纳斯说，罗马市收集、处理垃圾的主要做法有以下几个方面：
    一、统一规划、分区治理。罗马市既有古迹密集的古城，又有道路宽敞的新区，加上“七丘”城高低不平，各区环境特点不同，所以，全城划分为５０个区，分别治理。１９８２年开始，除古城中心要避免影响市容外，在其它地区布置了６万只垃圾箱。清洁局拥有４００余部运输车，分早、午、夜三班收运垃圾，基本做到了日产日清。另外，从今春开始将使用６０部高压清洗车清洗街面。
    二、一般垃圾填埋，有毒垃圾焚烧。罗马城西的马拉格罗垃圾站原是个废弃的采石场，具有防渗透功能，清洁局又对５公里长的周边做了防渗透处理，使之成了一个理想的垃圾站。压轧机将送来的垃圾压实，盖上一层土，与空气隔绝，达到无害处理。据介绍，仅这个垃圾站的处理能力足够罗马用到２００５年。法律规定，医用垃圾必须烧掉，不得与其它垃圾混合，违者要负刑事责任。
    三、分类收集，注重回收。分类收集在意大利已实行几年。１９８７年，意大利回收玻璃４０多万吨，并且百分之百地重新利用，有些玻璃厂的生产原料８０％是回收的玻璃。罗马还在４００多所学校布置了收集干电池的容器，在８００多家药店设置了过期药物收集箱。
    目前，罗马市正在研究利用垃圾中的纯有机物，生产高质量的有机肥料，并设法利用废物燃料来发电和供暖。莫利纳斯在采访结束时说：“城市垃圾处理已从一把扫帚的时代进入了高技术时代，还有不少问题等待着解决。”
