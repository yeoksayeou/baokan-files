　　中国为美国杂志设计封面
    新华社北京电　（记者邵建武）美国杂志《电子导报》（中文版）出版人费安伦近日在京透露，他们已在中央工艺美术学院约请学生设计封面。这在我国还是第一次。
    《电子导报》是美国电子、计算机行业的主要专业刊物，其中文版由美国卡纳斯公司和中国机械电子工业部电子科技情报研究所合作出版。以赠阅的方式，向中国电子、计算机行业的专业人员介绍世界电子、计算机行业的新技术、新产品和先进管理方法。自１９８８年４月试刊以来，它一直采用其英文版的封面。费安伦介绍说：“我们约请中央工艺美院的学生设计封面，一方面是为了增加杂志的中国色彩，一方面是为了向世界展示中国工艺美术设计的势力。”
