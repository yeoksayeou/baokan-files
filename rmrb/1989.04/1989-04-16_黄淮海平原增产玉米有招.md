From April this year, China's largest concentrated corn production area, the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, has launched an activity to increase yield in one million mu (approximately 66,667 hectares) of corn demonstration plots. The goal is to achieve an increase of 50 kilograms per mu and a total production increase of 50 billion kilograms over three years.

Corn is a key crop in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, with planting areas accounting for more than one-third of the national total. To achieve the goal of increasing corn yield, the region has adopted five technical measures, including selecting high-quality seeds and promoting standardized corn cultivation.
