The Foreign Ministry spokesperson today said that, at a time when North and South Korea have begun dialogue, the South Korean authorities' arrest of Reverend Mun Ik-hwan on the grounds of visiting the North is obviously not conducive to the dialogue and personnel exchanges between North and South Korea.

The spokesperson, in response to a reporter's request for comment on the South Korean authorities' arrest of Reverend Mun Ik-hwan on April 13, said, "China opposes all actions that are detrimental to easing tensions on the Korean Peninsula." He said, "Reverend Mun Ik-hwan went to the North to discuss the issue of peaceful reunification of Korea. Achieving national reunification through peaceful means is the common wish of the people living in North and South Korea."

    逮捕文益焕不利朝鲜北南对话
    新华社北京４月１９日电  外交部发言人今天说，在朝鲜北南双方已开始对话的情况下，南朝鲜当局以访问北方为由逮捕文益焕牧师，显然不利于朝鲜北南对话和人员交流。
    发言人在应记者要求，对南朝鲜当局于４月１３日逮捕文益焕一事发表评论时说，“中国反对一切不利于缓和朝鲜半岛局势的行动。”他说，文益焕牧师是为讨论朝鲜的和平统一问题而去北方访问的。以和平方式统一国家是居住在朝鲜北南两方的人民的共同心愿。
