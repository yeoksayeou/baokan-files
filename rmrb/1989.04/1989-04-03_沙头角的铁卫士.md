In Shenzhen's Shatoujiao, there is a small street just 200 meters long and over a meter wide. It welcomes 20,000 mainland visitors daily, not to mention those from Hong Kong, making it a bustling place. The soldiers of the 13th Company of the 6th Detachment of the Guangdong Provincial Border Defense Corps stand guard here day and night.

One stormy evening, Squad Leader Wu Lisheng was on duty alone at the Shatoujiao town checkpoint. A Hong Kong resident brought a young woman to the checkpoint, presenting his ID, a gold watch, and a stack of Hong Kong dollars, smiling and pleading with Wu, "This is my wife. Please, officer, let her through." Wu pushed away the watch and money, firmly stating, "There's no leeway on this matter. As long as she has her ID, she can pass." The Hong Kong resident said, "Oh, I forgot to bring her ID. It's dark and raining now. Please, officer, let her through. This little token of appreciation, only the three of us will know..." He then tried to put the money in Wu's pocket. Wu sternly replied, "Sir, please behave. If you persist, I'll have to confiscate the watch and money, and detain the young woman!" The Hong Kong resident had no choice but to leave with the young woman. At midnight, he tried the same trick again and was stopped by a new soldier!

Once, an official and his wife came to Shatoujiao. The man had his ID, but the woman did not. According to regulations, the man was allowed to enter the town, but the woman was stopped at the checkpoint. The woman tried to force her way through, but the soldier on duty, Lu Jianwen, blocked her path. She slapped Lu across the face. Lu did not retaliate but still did not let her pass.

Platoon Leader Li Guoxiong's father came to visit his son and wanted to stay with him. Li lived inside the town, so he arranged for his father to stay outside according to the regulations. His father was angry and almost hit him with a water pipe. Deputy Squad Leader Li Zhenhua's fiancée came and, taking advantage of Li being on duty alone at the checkpoint, asked to enter the town. Li refused, and she cried, but Li remained firm...

　　沙头角的铁卫士
    新建　琪书
    深圳沙头角，有一条仅２００米长、１丈多宽的小街，它每天迎接２万多人次的内地游客，加上香港来客，其热闹程度可想而知。广东省边防局第六支队十三中队的武警战士就日夜守卫在这里。
    一个风雨交加的傍晚，班长吴利胜一个人执勤在沙头角镇关口上。一名港客带着一位女青年来到跟前，拿出自己的证件、一块金表和一叠港币，笑着求吴班长：“这是我太太，求警察先生通融一下。”小吴推开金表和港币，不客气地说：“在这个问题上没有通融可谈，只要有证件就可以放行。”港客说：“哎呀，我忘了把她的证件带来了。眼下天黑下雨，请警察先生高抬贵手放她过去。我这点小意思，只有咱三个人知道……”说着便往小吴腰里塞。小吴义正词严：“先生，请自重。你再纠缠，我只好没收金表和港币，扣留这位女青年！”港客只好拉着女青年离去。午夜时分，他故伎重演，又吃了一位新战士的“顶门炮”！
    有一次，一位干部和他的妻子来到沙头角，男的有证件，女的没有，按规定男的进镇，女的被拦在镇外。女的硬冲关卡，执勤战士卢建文拦住不放，她朝小卢脸上打了一巴掌。小卢没有还手，但仍不放她过去。
    排长李国雄的父亲探望儿子来了，想和儿子住在一起。李排长住在镇内，他按规定把父亲安排在镇外。父亲很生气，差一点用水烟筒砸他的头。副班长李镇华的未婚妻来了，乘小李单独在关口执勤，要求进镇看看，小李不同意，她伤心地哭了，可小李终究没有软下心来……
