	Haiti Continues to Be in Turmoil

	Our reporter Guo Weicheng reports from Mexico City on April 3: By this evening, the "Leopard Battalion" stationed outside the capital, which participated in Sunday's coup, is still in a standoff with the troops loyal to the president. They are occupying part of the capital's airport and engaging in a gunfight with the troops loyal to the Avril regime. According to incomplete statistics, four officers have already been killed.

	Mexican media, citing news from Port-au-Prince, reported that the "Leopard Battalion" released Avril's son and brother, Interior Minister Saint, and three other government-related individuals on Sunday night. This was done in exchange for the government's release of the coup leader of the battalion, Rebel. However, the government rejected the coup forces' demands. As of this evening, the government has yet to issue the expected statement, and the situation in Haiti remains volatile.

　　海地继续动乱
    本报墨西哥城４月３日电  记者郭伟成报道：到今天黄昏为止，参与星期日政变的首都外围部队“豹子团”仍与忠于总统的部队处于对峙状态。他们盘踞着首都机场的一部分，与忠于阿夫里尔政权的部队进行枪战。据不完全统计，已经死亡４名军官。
    墨西哥城新闻媒介援引来自太子港的消息说，政变部队“豹子团”星期日晚上释放了阿夫里尔的一个儿子与兄弟、内政部长萨恩特以及另外３名与政府有关的人员，以此要求政府释放该团的政变领导人雷布。但是，政府拒绝了政变部队的要求。直到今天晚上，政府仍然没有发布要发布的公告，海地局势仍然处于动荡中。
