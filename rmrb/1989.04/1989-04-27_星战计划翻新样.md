Title: The Star Wars Plan Revamped

The direction of the "Star Wars" program has been a topic of consideration for the Bush administration since it took office. Recently, Defense Secretary Cheney confirmed that President Bush has decided to adopt the new concept of "Brilliant Pebbles." This differs from the original "Star Wars" plan proposed by Reagan, which involved establishing a large-scale, multi-layered defense shield in space. Instead, it focuses on deploying a large number of small, high-intelligence intercept rockets in space to form an anti-missile system. This change seems to indicate that the U.S. decision on the "Star Wars" program is to continue research but on a reduced scale.

The "Brilliant Pebbles" concept involves using 10,000 to 100,000 small, inexpensive, and high-intelligence intercept rockets to precisely intercept enemy nuclear missiles. According to the plan, these intercept rockets are 3 feet long, weigh 100 pounds, and travel at a speed of 4 miles per second. They are equipped with a "brain" (silicon chip) and "eyes" (wide-angle detectors) that function like a supercomputer. These devices can track the flames emitted when a missile is launched and automatically aim at the target without the need for command from detection satellites or ground stations. Reagan's original idea was to use high-energy laser weapons and particle beam weapons at various stages of the enemy's nuclear missile flight to intercept and destroy the missiles before they reach U.S. territory. These weapons are characterized by being "large, bulky, and expensive."

The "Brilliant Pebbles" concept was invented by two scientists from California. Last summer, they lobbied Bush to adopt this idea. It was also these two scientists who first convinced Reagan to propose the "Star Wars" plan in March 1983. It is reported that each intercept rocket costs between $500,000 and $1.5 million, with the total cost being one-third of the original plan. If everything goes smoothly, it is expected to be deployed by 1994.

However, this new concept has sparked criticism from many experts in the U.S., who describe it as an "immature, flawed," and even "unrealistic" plan that has not undergone sufficient research and evaluation. They also believe that it significantly underestimates the required costs. Some argue that the Soviet Union could develop new missiles that launch faster, entering space before the U.S. intercept rockets can detect their flames. Others warn that deploying so many intercept rockets in space could cause "traffic jams" and "collision disasters," with the resulting debris pollution and chain reactions posing significant hazards to astronauts and space shuttles.

　　星战计划翻新样
    本报记者  张亮
    “星球大战”计划向何处去？这是布什政府执政以来一直在考虑的问题之一。国防部长切尼最近证实，布什总统决定选择“灿烂卵石”的新概念。这与里根当初提出的“星球大战”计划的构想有所不同，即从在太空建立大规模的多层防御盾牌转向在太空部署大量小型高智能拦截火箭的反导弹系统。这一变化似乎表明，在“星球大战”计划问题上，美国的抉择是继续研究，但压缩规模。
    所谓“灿烂卵石”的新概念，就是用１万至１０万枚“小型、价廉和高智能”拦截火箭非常精确地截击敌方的核导弹。根据设想，这种拦截火箭长３英尺，重１００磅，飞行速度为每秒钟４英里，装有与超级电子计算机功能一样大的“头脑”（硅片）和眼睛（广角探测器）。这些装置能跟踪发射导弹时冒出的火焰，并自动瞄准目标，不需要探测卫星和地面站的指挥。而里根原来的设想是，在敌方核导弹飞行的各个阶段运用高能激光武器和粒子束武器等各种武器实行层层拦截，将敌方的核导弹摧毁在起飞、飞行途中以及到达美国本土之前。这类武器的特点是“体积大、笨重、造价昂贵”。
    “灿烂卵石”是加利福尼亚州的两位科学家发明的。去年夏天他们向布什游说，劝他接受这一设想。也正是这两位科学家首先说服里根在１９８３年３月提出了“星球大战”计划。据称，每枚拦截火箭耗资５０万至１５０万美元，全部费用为原方案的１／３。如果进展顺利，它可望在１９９４年部署。
    然而，这一新概念在美国已引起不少专家的非议，称它是“未经过充分研究和估价”的一种“不成熟、充满缺陷”甚至“不现实”的计划，而且大大低估了所需费用。有人认为，苏联可以建造起飞速度更快的新式导弹，在美国的拦截火箭尚未发现其火焰之前就进入太空。还有的人警告说，部署这么多的拦截火箭会在太空导致“交通阻塞”和“相撞灾难”，而相撞时造成的废片污染及其连锁反应对宇航员和航天飞机都是非常有害的。　　　（本报华盛顿４月２６日电）
