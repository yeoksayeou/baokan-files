Xinhua News Agency, Mexico City and Caracas, April 1st.

The foreign ministers of the five Central American countries have agreed to implement international supervision over the "problematic borders" in the region and decided to postpone the originally scheduled summit of the five countries' heads of state in Honduras to June.

According to a report by Mexico City Television, after two days of discussions, the foreign ministers of the five Central American countries reached an agreement on implementing international supervision at the closing ceremony in the capital of Costa Rica, San Jose, on the afternoon of the 31st. It is reported that the international supervision personnel will be organized by the United Nations, including approximately 100 non-combatant military personnel from the Federal Republic of Germany, Spain, Canada, and one Latin American country. The foreign minister of Costa Rica stated that United Nations observers will first patrol the borders of Honduras-Nicaragua, Honduras-El Salvador, and Nicaragua-El Salvador. The United Nations has requested that the governments of the five Central American countries and the guerrillas ensure the safety of the non-combatant international supervision personnel.

This ministerial meeting also discussed the issue of political supervision of the democratic processes in each country and the issue of stopping the provision of aid to non-official armed groups in the Central American region. The foreign minister of Nicaragua, Descot, stated that Nicaragua has fulfilled its commitment made at the summit in San Salvador in February this year and has begun domestic democratization. It is also reported that the four opposition parties in Nicaragua have formed a new "National Democratic Alliance" to prepare for the national elections in February next year. Due to the "health condition" of the current president of El Salvador, Duarte, and the government changeover to be held on June 1st, the foreign ministers' meeting agreed to El Salvador's proposal to postpone the summit of the five countries' heads of state to June in Honduras.

    五国首脑会议将于６月在洪都拉斯举行
    综合本报墨西哥城和加拉加斯４月１日电  记者郭伟成、朱满庭报道：中美洲五国外长会议同意对中美洲地区“有问题的边界”实行国际监督，并决定把原计划４月下旬在洪都拉斯举行的中美洲五国首脑会议推迟到６月。
    据墨西哥城电视台报道，中美洲五国外长会议经过两天的讨论，于３１日下午在哥斯达黎加首都圣何塞闭幕时对实行国际监督达成了协议。据悉，国际监督人员将由联合国出面组织，包括联邦德国、西班牙、加拿大和一个拉美国家的共约１００名非武装军事人员。哥斯达黎加外长表示，联合国观察员将首先在洪尼、洪萨和尼萨边界进行巡察。联合国要求中美洲五国政府和游击队切实保障非武装的国际监督人员的安全。
    这次外长会议还讨论了对各国民主进程进行政治监督的问题以及停止对中美洲地区非正式武装提供援助的问题。尼加拉瓜外长德斯科托表示，尼加拉瓜已经履行了在今年２月圣萨尔瓦多首脑会议上的承诺，开始了国内民主化。另据报道，尼加拉瓜４个反对党已经组成新的“全国民主联盟”，准备参加明年２月的全国大选。由于萨尔瓦多现总统杜阿尔特的“健康状况”，以及将于６月１日进行政府换届，外长会议同意萨尔瓦多的建议，把五国首脑会议推迟到６月在洪都拉斯举行。
