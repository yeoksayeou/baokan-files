The European Economic Community and the Latin American Eight Group of foreign ministers held a meeting this morning in Granada, a city in southern Spain.

The foreign ministers or state secretaries of the 12 EEC member countries and the seven foreign ministers of the Latin American Eight Group attended the meeting. Panama did not participate in the Eight Group's activities due to domestic political turmoil. The main agenda items for the meeting were to discuss ways to resolve the Latin American debt crisis and to explore how to develop trade relations between the EEC and the Latin American region.

The chairman of the EEC Council of Ministers, Spanish Foreign Minister Ordóñez, presided over today's meeting and delivered the opening remarks.

At today's meeting, the foreign ministers of the Latin American countries unanimously agreed that resolving the Latin American debt crisis is "urgent." They called on the EEC to take action on reducing the debt burden of Latin American countries. Argentine Foreign Minister Caputo pointed out that from 1982 to 1988, Latin American countries repaid $179 billion in debt, an amount nearly equal to half of the total debt of the region. The heavy debt burden has severely affected the economic development of Latin America. The region's gross domestic product in 1988 was 1.5% lower than in 1987.

Foreign Minister Caputo noted that due to the deterioration of the national economy, some Latin American countries have faced a series of political and social problems, and the democratic system and democratic process of these countries are facing serious threats.

The EEC foreign ministers expressed hope that they could reach a consensus in the coming weeks to contribute to reducing the debt of Latin American countries and promoting economic development in the region.

　　沉重外债严重影响拉美经济
　　欧共体和拉美八国集团召开外长会议探讨解决途径
    新华社马德里４月１５日电　欧洲共同体和拉美８国集团外交部长会议１５日上午在西班牙南部城市格拉纳达开幕。
    欧共体１２个成员国的外交部长或国务秘书和拉美８国集团的７国外交部长参加了会议。巴拿马因国内政局动荡暂时不参加８国集团的活动。会议的主要议题是探讨解决拉美债务危机的途径和讨论如何发展欧共体和拉美地区之间的贸易关系。
    欧共体部长理事会主席、西班牙外交部长奥多涅斯主持今天的会议并致开幕词。
    在今天的会议上，拉美国家的外长们一致认为，解决拉美国家的外债危机“刻不容缓”。呼吁欧共体在减少拉美国家的外债问题上采取行动。阿根廷外长卡普托在讲话中指出，１９８２年至１９８８年，拉美国家还债１７９０亿美元，此数目几乎相当于该地区外债总额的一半。沉重的债务负担严重地影响了拉美地区经济的发展。该地区１９８８年的国民生产总值比１９８７年下降了１．５％。
    卡普托外长指出，一些拉美国家由于国民经济形势恶化，引起一系列的政治和社会问题，国家的民主制度和民主进程面临严重威胁。
    欧共体的外长们表示，希望能在今后几个星期里达成一致立场，为减少拉美国家的外债和促进拉美地区的经济发展作出贡献。
