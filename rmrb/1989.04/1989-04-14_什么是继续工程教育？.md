Simply put, "continuing engineering education" is the continuation and supplementation of traditional education, and an important component of the entire educational system.

The definitions of continuing engineering education vary from country to country. Many countries consider it to be "the training and education of employees who have left regular schools and entered the workforce." It generally includes three levels: (1) education for in-service scientific and technical personnel who have graduated from university to update, broaden, and deepen their professional knowledge; (2) graduate education for in-service scientific and technical personnel; (3) education for technicians and skilled workers to upgrade their qualifications.

　　什么是继续工程教育？
    简单地说，所谓“继续工程教育”是传统教育的继续和补充，是整个教育体系的重要组成部分。
    各国继续工程教育的定义不尽相同。许多国家认为它是“对离开正规学校、走上工作岗位后的在职人员的培训和教育”。一般包括三个层次：（一）对大学毕业后的在职科技人员为更新、拓宽及加深专业知识所进行的教育；（二）对在职科技人员的研究生教育；（三）对技术员和技工进行提高学历的教育。
