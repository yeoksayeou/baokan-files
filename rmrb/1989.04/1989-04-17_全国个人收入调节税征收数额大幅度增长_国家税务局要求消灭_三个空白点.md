The amount of personal income adjustment tax collected nationwide in the first quarter of this year has reached 56.08 million yuan, nearly 1.5 times the amount collected in the same period last year. However, compared to the actual tax sources and the progress required to meet the targets, there is still a significant gap. The State Taxation Administration requires all regions to continue to strengthen tax collection and management work, take effective measures, and ensure that all taxes due are collected.

Currently, the tax collection situation varies greatly among provinces and municipalities. In provinces and municipalities with good performance, such as Guizhou, Yunnan, Jilin, and the Marine Oil Tax Bureau, more than 40% of the annual tax collection target has been completed. In Liaoning, Guangxi, Xinjiang, Guangdong, and Beijing, more than 25% of the annual target has been completed. In provinces and municipalities with poor performance, such as Hainan, Shaanxi, Henan, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, and Qinghai, the completion rate is at most 6%. In this regard, the State Taxation Administration believes it is necessary to eliminate three blind spots:

First, eliminate the blind spots in taxable items. According to investigations, the income from contracting and subcontracting is the taxable item with the widest tax base and the largest tax amount.

Second, eliminate the blind spots in regions.

Third, eliminate the blind spots in withholding and remitting taxes and self-reported tax payments.

The State Taxation Administration requires further strengthening of the pilot work for the declaration of personal taxable income. Through the pilot declaration, improve the tax collection and management methods, establish a withholding and remitting tax system, mobilize the masses to report, organize and strengthen the co-taxation and tax protection network, and reduce or eliminate tax evasion and avoidance.

　　全国个人收入调节税征收数额大幅度增长
　　国家税务局要求消灭“三个空白点”
    本报讯　全国今年一季度征收的个人收入调节税已达５６０８万元，比去年同期增长近１．５倍。但是实现收入同实有税源和任务要求进度相比，仍有不小的差距。国家税务局要求各地继续抓好征管工作，采取有效措施，做到应收尽收。
    目前看，各省市征收情况极不平衡。好的省市如贵州、云南、吉林以及海洋石油税务局已完成全年征收任务的４０％以上，辽宁、广西、新疆、广东、北京已完成全年任务的２５％以上，差的省市如海南、陕西、河南、内蒙古、甘肃、青海则最多完成了６％。对此，国家税务局认为有必要消灭三个空白点。即：
    一消灭应税项目的空白点。据调查，目前承包转包收入项目是应税项目中税源最广、税额最大的。
    二消灭地区空白点。
    三消灭代扣代缴及自行申报纳税的空白点。
    国家税务局要求进一步抓好个人应税收入申报试点工作。通过申报试点，完善征管办法，健全代扣代缴税款制度，发动群众举报，组织和加强协税护税网络，减少或杜绝偷漏税。
