Compared to the ancient art of painting, photography, with only 150 years of history, may still be in its infancy. However, within this short span of a century and a half, photographers have created a magical world of images. The exhibition "Photography Art: 1839-1989" currently on display at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, showcases the "natural brush" of photography art, depicting the real world and revisiting the development of photography art.

In 1839, the French scientist Louis Daguerre, through the French government, made his invention of "Daguerreotype" known to the world. This marked the birth of photography. When people saw that one did not need an artist to create images that were indistinguishable from real objects, they were astonished. Soon, "Daguerreotype" spread rapidly around the world. People were eager to learn photography, and Daguerre's photography textbook was reprinted 29 times in just 4 months and was translated into 6 languages.

In 1841, the British scientist William Henry Fox Talbot invented the "Calotype," which allowed multiple prints to be made from the same negative, thus laying the foundation for modern photography. The continuous improvement of photographic technology opened up a vast field for photographers to showcase their talents. Talbot's works already showed a strong artistic atmosphere. Works like "The Chess Players" and "The Ladder" demonstrated his superb compositional skills, while French portrait photographers such as Nadar and Carjat captured the unique characteristics of their subjects, striving for authenticity rather than realism, showcasing their talent in caricature art.

The earliest works that elevated photography to the status of art were "Art Photography," also known as "Composite Photography." The most famous "Composite Photography" is probably Oscar Rejlander's "Two Ways of Life." The work's composition is profound in meaning, with a grand hall filled with figures of various poses and expressions. The left side symbolizes diligence, the right side symbolizes indulgence, and the middle is regret. This work was exhibited at the Manchester Art Exhibition in 1857 and received acclaim. From then on, photography gained recognition in the art world.

Like painting, various schools such as Naturalism, Impressionism, New Realism, Abstract Art, and Modernism have all left their marks in the history of photography. Each school, with its unique artistic vision and creative style, has made photography a vibrant and diverse art form. For example, New Realism photographers pursue an extremely realistic style of expression, known as "Pure Photography." They often photograph the details of objects that are usually overlooked by common people, using close-up shots for exaggerated expression. Typical works include Paul Outerbridge's "Locomotive Pivot," Albert Renger-Patzsch's "Tree Roots," and Edward Weston's "Cross Section of a Cucumber." Modern photography, on the other hand, places more emphasis on expressing the photographer's inner feelings. For instance, American photographer Robert Frank's "July 4th" (see below), features a large American flag stretching across the center of the frame, making the viewer feel oppressed. From this, one can sense the photographer's gloomy mood.

Over the past 150 years, the world of photography has seen countless talents and masterpieces. The works exhibited in this exhibition have erected a monument to photography art in the hearts of the audience. This monument reflects the past and inspires the future. (Accompanying images)

　　“自然之笔”绘世界
　　——漫话摄影１５０年
　　白玉清
    比起古老的绘画，只有１５０年历史的摄影艺术也许还处于幼年时期。然而，就在这短短的一个半世纪中，摄影艺术家们却创造了一个神奇的影像世界。目前正在美国休斯敦艺术博物馆展出的“摄影艺术：１８３９—１９８９”摄影作品回顾展向人们展现了摄影艺术的“自然之笔”所描绘的真实世界，再现了摄影艺术的发展历程。
    １８３９年，法国科学家达盖尔通过法国政府将自己发明的“银版摄影术”公诸于世。这宣告了摄影艺术的诞生。看到不必经画家之手，任何人都能创造出与实物毫无二致的画面时，人们无不拍案叫绝。不久，“银版摄影术”不胫而走，风靡世界。人们对摄影趋之若鹜，达盖尔写的摄影教科书竟在４个月内发行了２９版，并译成６国文字。
    １８４１年，英国科学家塔尔波特发明了能用同一底片在纸上洗出多张照片的“卡罗摄影术”，从而奠定了现代摄影术的基础。摄影技术的不断完善为摄影家们开辟了施展才华的广阔天地。塔尔波特的作品即开始表现出浓重的艺术气息。如《下象棋的人》、《梯子》等都显示了高超的构图技巧，而法国肖像摄影家拿达尔和卡尔加特等人的作品则抓住人物的特征，力求画面率真而不写实，展示了他们漫画艺术的天才。
    最早使摄影跻身于艺术殿堂的是“美术摄影”，也就是当时称之为“集锦照”的摄影作品。最著名的“集锦照”当推雷兰达的“人生两条路”。作品构图寓意深邃，一座大厅内充满了姿态、神情各异的人物，左边象征勤劳，右边象征享乐，中间则是悔恨。这幅作品１８５７年参加曼彻斯特美术品展览会获得称誉。从此摄影才得到艺术界的公认。
    如同绘画一样，自然主义、印象派、新现实主义以及抽象派和现代派等流派都曾在摄影史上留下足迹。各个流派以自己独到的艺术主张和创作风格使摄影艺术五彩纷呈。如新现实主义摄影家追求一种极端写实的表现手法，即所谓的“纯净摄影”。他们往往拍摄一些不为常人注意的物体细部，用特写镜头作极度夸张的表现。其典型作品有帕邱拍摄的“火车头回转轴”、阿杰的“树根”以及葛伦显的“黄瓜横断面”等。而现代摄影则更注重表现摄影家本人的内心感受。如美国摄影家福兰克拍摄的“７月４日”（见下图），偌大一面星条旗横在画面正中，使人倍感压抑。从中不难体会到作者那阴郁的情绪。
    １５０年来，世界摄影艺术界人才辈出，杰作无数。此次展览会展出的作品在观众心中竖起了摄影艺术的丰碑。这丰碑展现着过去，也启示着未来。（附图片）
