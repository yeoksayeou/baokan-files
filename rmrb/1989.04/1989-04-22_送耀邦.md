Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 22nd.

Ten-mile-long streets, endless crowds, silently waiting...

At 12:05 PM, a soft rumble rolled from east to west through the crowd: "He's coming! He's coming!"

The hearse, draped in black crepe, slowly emerged from the solemn Great Hall of the People. With a roar, the crowd surged forward like a tide. The broad Chang'an Street once again recorded a tragic moment:

Hu Yaobang has left us!

Hu Yaobang has left us, taking with him the shrapnel from the Battle of Luoshan Pass, the scars of the Cultural Revolution, the gunpowder and dust of a 60-year revolutionary career, and his unfulfilled ambitions—he has left us.

Hu Yaobang has left us, stirring the hearts of millions. From Tiananmen Square to Babaoshan, the 15-kilometer-long streets were packed with people.

Workers, students, citizens, old and young, silently watched the hearse pass by. Some wore white flowers on their chests, others wore black armbands.

As the hearse passed Nanchang Street, about 200 meters away was a small courtyard, Hu Yaobang's home. Although this courtyard had a gate connecting to Zhongnanhai, he toiled day and night for a billion people, often not returning home for a month or two. He had received countless visitors, personally handled many petitions, "six years, two thousand cases"—how could people forget!

As the hearse passed Six Departments, a few girls in the crowd called out, "Uncle Hu, we miss you!" Several individual entrepreneurs specially rode tricycles to the side of Chang'an Street, allowing people behind them to stand on the vehicles to bid farewell to Hu Yaobang. The police maintaining order told the crowded crowd, "Please step back a bit, our feelings are the same!"

On the overpass at Fuxingmen, a young couple from Wuzhou held a small white flower in each hand, tightly embracing each other in the crowd. The woman anxiously called out, "Don't push, let us see Hu Yaobang one last time." A middle-aged intellectual from Tianjin, on a business trip to Beijing, said, "Hu Yaobang did a lot for us when he was alive. No matter how busy I am, I have to come to see him off, otherwise, how will I answer my children when they ask?"

The construction workers of the Beijing Municipal Sixth Construction Company, who were building the China National Arts and Crafts Museum, spontaneously put down their tools. On the rooftop, on the scaffolding and the elevator, they silently removed their hats in mourning.

The ten-mile-long street seemed unable to contain so much sorrow. The crowd surged, the hearse stopped and started. Everyone hoped the hearse would go slower, even slower. An old man said, "Hu Yaobang was upright and incorruptible, for this alone, he deserves to be sent off."

"The heart is with the people, whether it is big or small; the benefit is for the world, why should we quarrel over who gets more or less?" This couplet, revised by Hu Yaobang in his lifetime, is a true reflection of his brilliant life. Hu Yaobang never accepted gifts from the people, but today he had to accept the people's gift: respect and remembrance.

At this moment, Hu Yaobang's family members escorting the body, along with comrades such as Qiao Shi, Hu Qili, Song Ping, and Wen Jiabao, waved to the crowd outside the car, tears in their eyes. Hu Yaobang's eldest son, De Ping, placed his hands on his chest, expressing deep gratitude to those who came to see off his father.

As the hearse passed the Military Museum, a young man rode a bicycle following the car. On his back, he wore a long paper banner with the characters "Hu Yaobang" written on it, all the way to Babaoshan.

Babaoshan.

Eight young workers in black uniforms carried Hu Yaobang's coffin, slowly walking towards the farewell hall. This man of fiery passion will live forever in the flames.

Green wintergreen and white lilies framed Hu Yaobang's emaciated face. The Chinese Communist Party flag covering his body shone brightly under the camera lights.

Hu Yaobang's wife, Li Zhao, came to the farewell hall with the help of her children. Before the memorial service, she bravely held back her tears, instructing her children not to cry. Now, as she said her final goodbye to Hu Yaobang, she could no longer hold back...

According to Li Zhao's wish, Hu Yaobang's ashes will be buried deep in the green mountains and forests of Jiangxi's Qingyuan City, which he personally founded. Before the burial, his ashes will be placed in the ancestral hall at home.

In the afternoon, when Song Ping and Wen Jiabao accompanied Hu Yaobang's descendants to bring Hu Yaobang's urn back home, Li Zhao repeatedly said at the door, "Hu Yaobang, you've come home again."

Li Zhao, with tears in her eyes, said: Today, I saw the people's feelings for you. You left so decisively, without pain. You are with the cause you loved, your spirit is with us. We must turn our sorrow into strength...

### 送耀邦……

　　送耀邦……
    新华社记者
    十里长街，无尽的人流，在无声地等待……
    中午１２时零５分。一声轻雷由东向西地在人流中滚过：“来了！”“来了！”
    缀着黑纱的灵车，从庄严的人民大会堂缓缓开出。“呼啦”一声，人群潮水般地涌动起来。宽阔的长安街再次记录下一个悲痛的史实：
    耀邦走了！
    耀邦走了，带着娄山关的弹片，带着“文革”的鞭痕，带着６０年革命生涯的硝烟风尘，带着未完成的宏愿——走了。
    耀邦走了，牵动着千万颗心。从天安门广场到八宝山，１５公里长的街道两旁，到处都挤满了人。
    工人、学生、市民，老人和孩子，人们默默地目送灵车经过。他们之中一些人胸前佩戴白花，一些人臂上戴着黑纱。
    灵车经过南长街口，距这里２００多米远的一座小院，就是耀邦的家。尽管这座小院有门与中南海相通，可是，他为十亿人日夜操劳，常常一两个月也回不了一次家。他曾接待过无数群众，亲自处理过许多上访信件，“六年两千件”，人们怎能不记忆犹新！
    灵车经过六部口，几位挤在人群中的小姑娘齐声呼唤：“胡伯伯，我们怀念您呀！”几个个体户特地蹬着三轮车来到长安街边，让后排的群众站在车上为耀邦送行。维持秩序的民警对拥挤的人群说，请大家往后退一退，我们的心情是一样的！
    复兴门立交桥上，一对来自梧州的青年夫妇手中各自攥着一朵小白花紧紧地依偎在人群中。女的焦急地叫：“快别挤了，让我们好好看一眼耀邦吧。”一位从天津来京出差的中年知识分子说：“耀邦在世时为我们办了很多实事，再忙我也要来送送他，不然回家孩子问起，我怎么回答！”承建中国工艺美术馆的北京市六建二分公司的建筑工人们不约而同地放下了手中工具，在楼顶上，在脚手架和升降机上，默默地脱帽致哀。
    十里长街，仿佛盛不下这么多的悲哀。人群涌动，灵车时开时停。人们都希望灵车开得慢些，再慢些。一位老人说：“耀邦一身正气、两袖清风，凭这，就该送送他。”
    “心在人民，原无论大事小事；利归天下，何必争多得少得。”耀邦生前所改的这幅古对联，正是他光辉一生的写照。耀邦生前不收群众送的礼物，今天却不得不收下人民的一份厚礼：敬仰和哀思。
    此时此刻，护送遗体的耀邦同志的家属以及乔石、胡启立、宋平、温家宝等同志，和车外的群众互相招手，泪眼相望。耀邦的长子德平双手放在胸前，向为他父亲送行的人们表示深深的谢意。
    灵车从军事博物馆经过，一位青年骑着自行车跟随在车队后面。他的背上披着一张拖地长纸，上书“耀邦”二字，一直向八宝山送去。
    八宝山。
    ８名身着黑色服装的青年工人抬着耀邦灵柩，缓缓走向告别室。这个有着火一般激情的人，将在烈火中永生。
    碧绿的麦冬，雪白的马蹄莲，衬映着耀邦同志清癯的面容。覆盖在他身上的中国共产党党旗，在摄影灯光的照射下，光彩夺目。
    耀邦夫人李昭在子女搀扶下来到告别室。在追悼会前，她强忍悲痛，叮嘱子女不要哭。此刻，向耀邦诀别，她再也忍不住了……
    根据李昭同志的愿望，耀邦的骨灰将深葬在他生前亲手创建的江西共青城的青山绿林之中。在安葬之前，他的骨灰存放在家中的灵堂内。
    下午，当宋平、温家宝同志陪同耀邦的子孙，将耀邦的骨灰盒捧回家中时，李昭在大门口连声说：“耀邦，你又回家来了。”
    李昭眼含泪水说：今天，我看到了人民对你的感情。你去了，去得这样利索，没有痛苦。你和你所热爱的事业同在，你的精神与我们同在。我们一定要把悲痛变成力量……
