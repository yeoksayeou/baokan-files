According to calculations by the National Bureau of Statistics, the population of mainland China will reach 1.1 billion tomorrow. To further raise the awareness of the entire Party and the people of the nation about China's population problem, the State Council has designated April 14, 1989, as the day China's population reaches 1.1 billion and has decided to launch a nationwide campaign to mark the 1.1 billion population day. This activity is of great significance, and we hope that all localities will seriously carry it out.

China is the country with the largest population in the world. With a large population, limited arable land, and scarce resources per capita, these are our basic national conditions. Therefore, the population problem is a major issue in China's social and economic development. To make our country prosperous, our nation thrive, and our people happy, we must insist on implementing the family planning policy while developing the economy, strictly control the rapid growth of the population, make the population growth adapt to social and economic development, and coordinate it with resource utilization and ecological environment. This is one of our basic state policies.

China has achieved remarkable results in implementing family planning and controlling population growth. Since the 1970s, the population growth rate on the mainland has rapidly declined. The birth rate dropped from 33.59‰ in 1970 to 20.78‰ in 1988, and the natural population growth rate fell from 25.83‰ in 1970 to 14.20‰ in 1988. If we had maintained the 1970 natural population growth rate, from the 1970s to now, China would have had to accommodate more than 200 million additional people. In other words, if we had not resolutely implemented the family planning policy, the mainland population would very likely have already exceeded 1.3 billion. Practice has fully proven that our family planning policy is completely correct.

Although China has achieved remarkable results in controlling population growth, we must recognize that rapid population growth remains a prominent issue. Comrade Deng Xiaoping recently said in a meeting with Togo's President Eyadéma: "Our difficulty lies in the fact that our population is too large, and the work of controlling population growth is still not done well enough." Comrade Deng Xiaoping's words are very correct. We must deeply understand the spirit of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's remarks and resolutely do a good job in controlling population growth. China has a large population base and is currently in the third peak period of population growth since the founding of New China. This peak began in 1986 and will continue until the end of the century. If the current birth rate is maintained, the number of births each year will exceed 20 million, which will inevitably cause many difficulties for the entire population in terms of food, clothing, housing, transportation, education, health, employment, and other aspects, and will inevitably affect the progress of the Four Modernizations. Therefore, the work of controlling rapid population growth must not be relaxed in any way and must be continued with serious efforts. This is a major issue of great concern to the people of the entire nation. At the recently concluded Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress and the Second Session of the Seventh Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, many deputies and members expressed concern and concern about the rapid growth of the population. In his government work report at this session of the NPC, Premier Li Peng made clear and strict requirements for implementing family planning and controlling population growth. All localities must fully recognize the severity of China's population situation and the importance and urgency of controlling population growth, continue to grasp and do a good job in family planning work, and strive to strictly control rapid population growth and continuously improve population quality.

1. Family planning work is a comprehensive and difficult task. Therefore, the principal leaders of party committees and governments at all levels must personally oversee this work and implement a responsibility system. Population plans should be incorporated into the social and economic development plans of the region for comprehensive consideration, and necessary conditions should be created for family planning work. How well family planning work is done in a place should be used as an important criterion for evaluating the performance of the local party and government.

2. We must resolutely, conscientiously, and comprehensively implement the current family planning policy. This is: to advocate late marriage and late childbearing, fewer and better births, and to advocate that a couple have only one child; except in special cases with approval, state cadres and employees, urban residents should have only one child; in rural areas, some people with special circumstances, including those with only one daughter, who wish to have a second child, can have a second child after a few years with approval; in any case, three children cannot be born; minority areas should also advocate family planning, and specific requirements and measures should be formulated by relevant provinces and autonomous regions according to local actual conditions. It must be made clear that this policy must be implemented and carried out for a fairly long period in the future. We must maintain the stability of this policy to control population growth. At present, some places have shown a tendency of laissez-faire in childbearing, which is wrong, and effective measures must be taken to correct it and ensure that this policy is truly implemented.

3. This work should gradually be brought under the rule of law. At the same time, extensive and in-depth publicity and education work should be done to raise the awareness of the broad masses to implement family planning, and to carefully guide the masses in family planning, providing good services in this regard.

4. Comprehensive management should be implemented. All departments and mass organizations should regard the implementation of the family planning policy as their own responsibility. When formulating various policies, they should be conducive to fewer and better births and controlling population growth. In impoverished areas, poverty alleviation work should be combined with family planning work to change the vicious cycle of "the poorer, the more children, the more children, the poorer." The public security, industry and commerce, urban construction, and family planning departments should work closely together to study and solve the problem of family planning management for the floating population. The old-age insurance industry should be actively developed to help the masses who respond to the call for family planning to eliminate their worries.

In solving the world's population problem, China has an important mission. If China does a good job in controlling its population, it will be beneficial to the stability of the world's population. China's family planning work has received sympathy and support from many countries, international organizations, and international friends. We are willing to strengthen cooperation with countries, international organizations, and international friends who care about the population problem to make unremitting efforts for the stability of the world's population and for the prosperity and peace of the world.

Comrades! We believe that as long as the entire Party and the people of the nation are fully mobilized, further enhance the awareness of population and per capita, and persistently do a good job in family planning, we will definitely be able to do a better job in controlling population growth.

　　严格控制人口过快增长
　　——在“中国１１亿人口日”大会上的讲话
　　田纪云同志们、朋友们：
    根据国家统计局推算，我国大陆人口到明天将达到１１亿。为了进一步引起全党、全国人民对我国人口问题的高度重视，国务院将今年４月１４日定为我国１１亿人口日，并决定在全国开展１１亿人口日宣传活动。这项活动意义重大，希望各地认真把它搞好。
    我国是世界人口最多的国家。人口多，耕地少，人均占有资源少，这是我们的基本国情。因此，人口问题是我国社会和经济发展中的一个重大问题。为了使我们国家富强，民族繁荣，人民幸福，我们必须坚持在发展经济的同时实行计划生育政策，严格控制人口的过快增长，使人口增长与社会和经济发展相适应，同资源利用和生态环境相协调。这是我们的一项基本国策。
    我国实行计划生育、控制人口增长已经取得了明显的成效。自７０年代以来，我国大陆人口增长速度迅速下降。人口出生率从１９７０年的３３．５９‰，下降到１９８８年的２０．７８‰，人口自然增长率从１９７０年的２５．８３‰下降到１９８８年的１４．２０‰，假如我们仍保持１９７０年的人口自然增长率的话，从７０年代到现在，我国还要多增加两亿多人口。也就是说，如果我们不坚决执行计划生育政策的话，现在我国大陆人口很可能已经超过了１３亿。实践充分证明，我们实行计划生育的政策是完全正确的。
    我国在控制人口增长方面虽然已经取得了明显的成绩，但是要看到，人口增长过快仍然是当前的一个突出问题。小平同志最近在会见多哥总统埃亚德马时说：“我们难就难在人口太多，而且控制人口增长的工作还做得不够好。”小平同志讲的非常正确，我们要深刻领会小平同志的讲话精神，坚决把控制人口增长的工作做好。我国人口基数大，现在又处在新中国成立以来第三次人口出生高峰期。这次高峰从１９８６年开始，将持续到本世纪末。如果保持目前的生育水平，每年出生的人口将在２０００万以上，这就不能不使全国人民在吃饭、穿衣、住房、交通、教育、卫生、就业等方面都遇到许多困难，不能不影响四个现代货建设的进程。因此，控制人口过快增长的工作，不能有任何松懈，一定要继续认真抓好。这是全国人民十分关心的一个大问题。在刚刚闭幕的全国七届人大二次会议和全国七届政协二次会议上，很多代表和委员都对我人口增长过快表示忧虑和关切。李鹏总理在这次人代会上作的政府工作报告中，对实行计划生育、控制人口增长提出了明确而严格的要求。各地一定要充分认识我国人口形势的严峻性和控制人口增长的重要性和紧迫性，继续抓紧抓好计划生育工作，为严格控制人口过快增长、不断提高人口素质而努力。
    一、计划生育工作，是一项综合性的难度很大的工作。因此，各级党委和政府的主要领导人都要亲自抓这项工作，并实行责任制。要把人口计划纳入地区的社会经济发展规划统筹考虑，并为计划生育工作创造必要的条件。一个地方计划生育工作创造必要的条件。一个地方计划生育工作抓得如何，应该作为衡量当地党和政府政绩的一条重要标准。
    二、要坚定不移地、认真地、全面地贯彻执行现行的计划生育政策。这就是：提倡晚婚晚育，少生优生，提倡一对夫妇只生育一个孩子；国家干部和职工、城镇居民除特殊情况经过批准外，一对夫妇只生育一个孩子；农村某些群众确有特殊情况，包括独女户，要求生二胎的，经过批准可以隔几年以后生第二胎；不论哪一种情况都不能生三胎；少数民族地区也要提倡计划生育，具体要求和做法由有关省、自治区根据当地实际情况制定。必须明确，这个政策在今后相当长的时期内必须坚持贯彻执行。要保持这个政策的稳定，以利于控制人口增长。目前，有的地方生育出现放任自流的现象，这是不对的，要采取切实有效的措施，坚决加以纠正，使这项政策真正贯彻落实。
    三、要把这项工作逐步纳入法制轨道。同时，要广泛深入地做好宣传教育工作，提高广大群众实行计划生育的自觉性，并精心指导群众计划生育，在这方面为群众提供良好的服务。
    四、实行综合治理。所有部门和群众团体都要把贯彻计划生育政策作为自己责无旁贷的任务。在制定各项政策时都应有利于少生优生，控制人口增长。在贫困地区，要把扶贫工作和计划生育工作结合起来，改变“越穷越生，越生越穷”的恶性循环状况。各地公安、工商、城建、计划生育等部门要密切配合，认真研究解决对流动人口的计划生育管理问题。要积极发展养老保险事业，帮助响应计划生育号召的群众解除后顾之忧。
    在解决世界人口问题上，我国负有重要任务。我国控制人口的工作做好了，有利于世界人口的稳定。我国的计划生育工作曾经得到许多国家、国际组织和国际友人的同情和支持，我们愿意同关心人口问题的国家、国际组织、国际友人加强合作，为稳定世界人口，为世界的繁荣与和平做出不懈的努力。
    同志们！我们相信，只要全党和全国人民充分动员起来，进一步增强人口意识和人均观念，坚韧不拔地做好计划生育工和，我们就一定能够把控制人口增长的工作做得更有成效。
