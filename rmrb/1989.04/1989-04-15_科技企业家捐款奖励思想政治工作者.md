	Tech entrepreneur Sheng Huichun, general manager and senior engineer of the Science and Technology Development Company of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has donated 200,000 yuan from his personal income derived from non-occupational inventions to establish a reward fund. This fund will support the Chinese Academy of Sciences in setting up the "Thought Political Work Rainbow Award."

	It is not uncommon for tech entrepreneurs to donate funds to support scientific research and talent cultivation. However, this is the first instance where funds have been specifically allocated to reward outstanding political educators. Sheng Huichun's initiative and support for the "Thought Political Work Rainbow Award" by the Chinese Academy of Sciences will see 20-30 outstanding political educators in the academy being rewarded annually.
