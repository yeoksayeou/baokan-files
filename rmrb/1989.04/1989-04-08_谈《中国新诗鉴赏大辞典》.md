Chinese modern poetry began in 1917, but its establishment and flourishing are inseparable from the May Fourth Movement and the Literary Revolution. On the eve of the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement and the Literary Revolution, Jiangsu Literature and Arts Publishing House has published the "Great Dictionary of Chinese New Poetry Appreciation."

Modern poetry, starting from the attempts by Hu Shi and others, has endured praise and criticism to this day. However, people rarely recognize modern poetry in the context of historical progress. The "Great Dictionary of Chinese New Poetry Appreciation" makes up for this deficiency. It collects 648 poems by 375 poets from 1917 to the present, encompassing different periods, methods, styles, and schools of modern poetry. It is a comprehensive survey of Chinese modern poetry over the past 70 years and a large-scale tool for appreciating modern poetry.

This dictionary, on a relatively large scale, introduces symbolic poetry, obscure poetry, and various schools of poetry from Taiwan and Hong Kong. It also introduces poems by figures such as Zhou Zuoren, Chen Hengzhe, Xu Zhimo, Shen Congwen, Liang Shiqiu, Feng Yuxiang, and Gao Changhong, which were either not selected or rarely selected in previous anthologies. It systematically introduces the modern poetry of the "July" school led by Hu Feng.

In compiling this dictionary, a point-line structure was adopted. Poets are arranged by their birth years, and each poem is independently appreciated. The poems are connected by an implicit line, supplemented by two appendices that sketch different aspects: "Introduction to Selected Poets" introduces the poets' creative paths and achievements; "Seventy Years of Chinese Modern Poetry" is a relatively complete chronicle of significant events in modern poetry over the past 70 years. This material, with the assistance of Luo Fu, Zhang Mo, and others in Taiwan, includes major events in the poetry world in Taiwan over the years. The arrangement of these two lines provides a fresh impression.

This dictionary specially invited renowned poets, critics, professors, and scholars from home and abroad to contribute articles. Their appreciation articles are themselves works of art.

　　谈《中国新诗鉴赏大辞典》
　　郭济访
    中国新诗虽发轫于１９１７年，但它的登堂入室、蔚为大观却是离不开“五四”运动和文学革命的推波助澜的。在“五四”运动和文学革命七十周年前夕，江苏文艺出版社推出了《中国新诗鉴赏大辞典》。
    新诗从胡适等人的尝试初始，在褒贬毁誉之间蹒跚至今，但是，人们较少在历史的大跨度中认识新诗。《中国新诗鉴赏大辞典》对此有所弥补。它荟集了自１９１７年至今的３７５名诗人的６４８首诗作，集不同时期、不同创作方法、不同风格、不同流派的新诗，是对中国新诗七十余年的巡视，是一部大型的新诗鉴赏工具书。
    这部辞典以较大的规模介绍了象征诗、朦胧诗和台港各种流派的新诗，并且，还介绍了过去各种选本不选或少选的周作人、陈衡哲、徐志摩、沈从文、梁实秋、冯玉祥、高长虹等人的诗，系统地介绍了以胡风为首的“七月”诗派的新诗。
    这部辞典在编选时采用了点线结构的方式。以诗人的生年排列，诗歌单篇独立鉴赏，各篇之间以暗线相连，加上两个附录从不同的方面进行勾勒：《入选诗人简介》介绍了诗人创作之行踪与成绩；《中国新诗七十年》是一份较完备的新诗七十年大事记，这份资料在台湾洛夫、张默等先生协助下，收录了台湾历年诗坛大事。这纵横两条线索的梳理，给人以新鲜的印象。
    这部辞典特邀请了海内外知名的诗人、评论家、教授、学者参加撰稿。他们的鉴赏文章本身便是一种艺术品。
