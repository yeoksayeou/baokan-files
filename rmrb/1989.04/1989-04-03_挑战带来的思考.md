To be honest, before coming to Dortmund, no one considered the Belgian team as a serious opponent. However, the facts forced people to take this new team seriously. The match lasted for over three hours, and the Chinese team had to fight hard to defeat the Belgian team with a score of 5:2.

The hero for Belgium was Philippe Seive, who first defeated the Chinese star Jiang Jialiang with a score of 2:1, and then defeated Tian Yi with a score of 2:0. This 17-year-old university student can pull high-quality loops on both sides of the court and is skilled at playing long balls, making him quite effective against fast attacks.

Chinese head coach Xu Shaofa said after the match that China generally knows too little about Europe. Before the match, they didn't even know the names of the opponents, let alone understand the opponents' technical strengths. It was only during the match that they realized the Belgian team was not to be underestimated. Belgian athletes can attack from both sides and are effective at playing long balls against the Chinese team.

The reporter feels that the era of China easily winning 5:0 is over. The new situation has posed a serious challenge to China.

　　挑战带来的思考
    说老实话，来多特蒙德之前谁也没把比利时队当成对手。然而事实却不得不使人们对这支新秀刮目相看。比赛进行了３个多小时，中国队经过艰苦的奋战，才以５∶２战胜比利时队。
    为比利时立下战功的是菲利普·塞伊夫，他先以２∶１战胜中国名将江嘉良，又以２∶０力克滕毅。这个１７岁的大学生在场上两面都能拉质量很好的弧圈球，又善打长球，对付快攻相当有办法。
    中国队总教练许绍发在赛后发表感想说，中国对欧洲总的说知道得太少了。上场前连对方姓甚名谁都未搞清，更甭说了解对手的技术特长了，打起来才知比利时队不可小瞧。比利时运动员两面能攻，打长球，对付中国队相当有效。
    记者感到，中国动辄打５∶０的时代已经过去。新形势已经对中国提出严峻挑战。
