Our country is the first in the world to invent ceramics and is renowned as the "Ceramic Kingdom." By the eighth century during the Tang Dynasty, Chinese ceramics had already entered the international market and were treasured as precious items.

Flipping through the history of Chinese poetry, one can find that the earliest poems about ceramics are in the "Book of Songs." There are lines such as "The elder's ocarina, the second son blows the sheng." The ocarina is an ancient wind instrument made of pottery.

Throughout the dynasties, many poems about ceramics praise the exquisite craftsmanship of ceramic products. Sichuan ceramics have a unique style. The great poet Du Fu once wrote a poem praising them: "In the great county, the fired ceramics are light and strong, striking like silk and jade, spreading the fame of Chengdu; your white bowl is as pure as frost and snow, quickly send it to my thatched cottage, it would be a pity to waste it." Ceramic products from Yue (Zhejiang) during the Tang Dynasty were also famous. Lu Guimeng wrote in "Secret Color Yue Ware": "In the ninth autumn, the wind and dew open the Yue kiln, stealing the green color from a thousand peaks." These two lines describe the kiln firing in autumn, a season when plants wither, yet the kiln produces ceramics as green as a thousand overlapping peaks.

Some poems about ceramics praise the skills of the ceramic artisans. Jingdezhen, the ceramic capital, became the center of China's ceramic handicraft industry as early as the Ming Dynasty. At that time, the founder of the Hu Gong Kiln, Huo Shijiu (originally named Huo Wei), was a master ceramist with superb skills. He created a high-grade artistic ceramic cup, with a beautiful shape and vibrant glaze, clear as cinnabar, and bright as flowing clouds, known as the "Liu Xia Cup." Someone presented him with a poem: "To seek cinnabar in the market, the sound of pine and clouds from the kiln, let you point out the Liu Xia Cup, and recognize the nine-bend spring at Guan Ting."

There is another type of ceramic poetry that is written directly on ceramics, which is also interesting. The Changsha Tongguan Kiln was a famous kiln in China during the Tang Dynasty. Many of the ceramic pots it produced had poems and couplets written on the outer walls and inside the bowls. For example, many wine pots had the following poem: "White jade is not a treasure, I do not need a thousand gold coins, I cherish a thousand sheets of paper, my heart holds ten thousand volumes of books."...

Even more unique and interesting is the ceramic poetry that hides poems within paintings, combining poetry and painting. In the ceramic gallery of the Palace Museum in Beijing, there is a blue-and-white porcelain vase with red underglaze, made in the Jingdezhen Imperial Kiln during the Yongzheng era. The vase is decorated with the "Three Friends of Winter" - pine, bamboo, and plum blossom. The bamboo leaves are composed of a five-character poem. The poem reads: "Bamboo has the posture of supporting the sky, the old pine endures the cold of the year. The plum blossom leads all flowers, the three friends rejoice in the four seasons." The ingenuity of the design and the uniqueness of the scene truly embody the harmony of poetry and painting.

　　陶瓷诗话
　　雪山
    我国是世界上第一个发明瓷器的国家，并被誉为“瓷国”。在公元八世纪的唐代，中国瓷器便进入国际市场，被视若珍宝。
    翻开中国诗史，可以发现最早写陶瓷的诗歌，要算《诗经》，上有“伯氏之埙，仲氏吹篪”等诗句。埙，是古代一种陶制吹奏乐器。
    历代写陶瓷的诗，不少是赞美陶瓷制品的精美。四川陶瓷风格独特，大诗人杜甫曾赋诗赞曰：“大邑烧瓷轻且坚，叩如衣玉锦城传；君家白碗胜霜雪，急送茅斋也可怜。”唐代越地陶瓷产品也很著名。陆龟蒙在《秘色越器》中咏道：“九秋风露越瓷开，夺得千峰翠色来。”这两句诗写秋季出窑，季节虽是草木凋黄，可是窑内却烧出了千峰叠翠的好瓷。
    另有一些咏陶瓷的诗，则是赞美制瓷师傅的技艺。瓷都景德镇，早在明代就成为全国瓷器手工业的中心。当时民间窑厂壶公窑的创办人昊十九（原名昊为），是技艺高超的制瓷名师。他烧造的一种高级艺术瓷盏，造型优美，釉色绚丽，明如朱砂，艳若流霞，被称为“流霞盏”。有人题诗相赠：“为觅丹砂到市廛，松声云影自壶天，凭君点出流霞盏，去认关亭九曲泉。”
    还有一种瓷器诗，是直接写在瓷器上，也饶有兴味。长沙铜官窑是我国唐代著名的瓷窑。它生产的许多瓷壶的外壁和碗盏的内心上，便有各种诗词、联句。比如不少酒壶上，就题有这样的诗：“白玉非为宝，千金我不须，怀念千张纸，心藏万卷书。”……
    更为独特而有趣的是，陶瓷上画中藏诗，诗画合一。在北京故宫博物院的陶瓷馆里，有一只青花釉里红花瓶，烧制于雍正时的景德镇御窑。瓶上画“岁寒三友”松竹梅，画中的竹叶便是由一首五言诗组成。诗曰：“竹有擎天势，苍松耐岁寒。梅花魁万卉，三友四时欢。”其构思之巧妙，画面之别致，真可谓诗情画意，相得益彰。
