Individual Farmers Establish 39 Nursing Homes

Xinhua News Agency

A report from our correspondent Wang Chu: In Shandong, individual farmer entrepreneur Liang Xisen has established a nursing home in his own village that can accommodate 50 elderly people, and he insists on setting aside 100,000 yuan from his annual net income as a pension fund for the nursing home. Recently, the Ministry of Civil Affairs sent a delegation to Yangjia Township in Leling City to present Liang Xisen with a "Deed of Honor" certificate and a copper plaque.

An official from the Ministry of Civil Affairs revealed that individual farmer entrepreneurs across the country have established 39 nursing homes. He said that by the end of the century, the elderly population in China's rural areas will exceed 100 million. Like Liang Xisen, a large number of individual farmer entrepreneurs are changing the past situation where social welfare was entirely the responsibility of the state, and are blazing a new trail where the state and individuals work together.

　　个体农民企业家办敬老院３９所
    本报讯　记者王楚报道：山东个体农民企业家梁希森在本村自办可容５０位老人的敬老院，坚持每年从纯收入中拿出１０万元作为敬老院养老基金。最近，民政部派员去乐陵市杨家乡，向梁希森赠送了“德高义重”证书和铜匾。
    民政部一位官员透露，全国个体农民企业家已办敬老院３９所。他说，本世纪末，我国农村老年人口将达１亿以上。像梁希森这样一大批个体农民企业家，一改过去社会福利由国家全包状况，正走出一条国家、个人一起办的新路子。
