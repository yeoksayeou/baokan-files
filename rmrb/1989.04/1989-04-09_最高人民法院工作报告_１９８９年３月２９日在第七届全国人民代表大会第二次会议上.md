Report on the Work of the Supreme People's Court
— March 29, 1989, at the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress

Rèn Jiànxīn, President of the Supreme People's Court

Comrades,

Over the past year, the Supreme People's Court has adhered to the theory and basic line of the socialist primary stage proposed by the Thirteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. It has fulfilled its duties as stipulated by the Constitution and laws, striving to play the role of the state judicial organ in punishing crimes, protecting the people, promoting reform, and ensuring the Four Modernizations. The main work situation is reported as follows, please review it.

I. To maintain social stability, ensure the rectification and deepening of reform, and vigorously carry out various judicial work

(1) On criminal trials

In 1988, courts at all levels across the country handled 3,133,060 criminal cases, an increase of 8.2% over the previous year; concluded 3,124,750 cases, an increase of 7% over the previous year; sentenced 3,687,900 defendants, an increase of 13% over the previous year. Among them, those sentenced to more than 5 years of imprisonment, life imprisonment, and death penalty (including suspended death penalty) totaled 1,135,330, accounting for 30.8%, an increase of 14.2% over the previous year; those sentenced to less than 5 years of imprisonment, detention, control, and those exempted from criminal punishment totaled 2,532,180, accounting for 68.7%, an increase of 12.7% over the previous year; 2,039 were acquitted. Courts across the country continued to implement the policy of severely punishing criminals who seriously endanger social order. For those with statutory mitigating or reducing circumstances, they were sentenced more leniently or reduced in punishment. In 1988, courts across the country suspended sentences for 279,940 people; for those who showed genuine repentance and meritorious service during their imprisonment, 1,515,380 were granted sentence reduction or parole; 2,030 cases were accepted from the People's Procuratorate for retrial, and 2,000 cases were concluded. After review, 737 cases were found to be incorrect and were retried, accounting for 36.9%.

Currently, social order is generally stable, but unstable factors are increasing. The situation we face is still quite severe. The number of major criminal cases handled by courts across the country has increased significantly. In 1988, the number of intentional homicide cases handled by courts across the country increased by 9.1% compared to 1987, robbery cases increased by 43.1%, and major theft cases increased by 63.8%. Wandering criminals are rampant, and in large and medium-sized cities, transportation lines, and coastal open areas, wandering criminals account for a large proportion of all criminal cases, reaching over 50% in some places. Crimes induced by social evils are quite serious in some places. Therefore, courts should continue to implement the policy of severely and swiftly punishing criminals who seriously endanger social order, especially focusing on cracking down on criminal gangs and the main criminals, repeat offenders, and habitual offenders in wandering criminal cases. Courts at all levels should actively participate in the special campaign to rectify social order, concentrating on cracking down on and rectifying prominent illegal and criminal activities in their areas. Especially in large and medium-sized cities, transportation lines, and coastal open areas, courts should actively cooperate with relevant departments to improve social order, aiming to achieve the goal of better social order this year than last year.

In recent years, a notable issue in criminal cases is the increasing number of juvenile crimes. In 1988, juveniles aged 14 and above but under 18 accounted for 8.9% of those sentenced, an increase of 13.8% over the previous year. To strengthen the comprehensive treatment of juvenile crimes, the Supreme People's Court has promoted the experience of establishing juvenile criminal case collegial panels by courts in Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places. For juvenile delinquents, the focus is on education, reform, and rescue, implementing "education through trial"; at the same time, efforts are made to work with parents, schools, and society to guide, prevent, and jointly correct the bad behavior of juvenile delinquents. This approach has been effective. We propose that this year, based on needs and possibilities, juvenile criminal case collegial panels should be gradually established in basic courts and some intermediate courts in large and medium-sized cities and coastal open areas. We hope that youth organizations, women's organizations, and educational departments, as well as relevant sectors of society, will jointly participate in the comprehensive treatment of juvenile delinquency; and through legislation and improving judicial organizations and procedures, gradually perfect our country's judicial system for correcting juvenile delinquents.

In 1988, courts across the country handled 551,800 economic crime cases, concluded 557,100 cases (including those from previous years), and sentenced 749,230 defendants. Among them, 8,248 were sentenced for embezzlement (including 166 with amounts between 500,000 and 10 million yuan, and 73 with amounts over 10 million yuan, with the highest amount being 33.4 million yuan), and 1,584 were sentenced for bribery (including 9 with amounts between 500,000 and 10 million yuan, and 12 with amounts over 10 million yuan). Among the embezzlement and bribery criminals, 111 were sentenced to life imprisonment or death penalty (including suspended death penalty). 1,699 were sentenced for speculation, 198 for smuggling, and 785 for tax evasion. Overall, courts across the country have seriously implemented the policy of severely punishing serious economic crimes, adhering to the principles of being resolute, cautious, and ensuring accuracy. They have paid attention to strictly distinguishing between work errors and illegal crimes, and between general illegal acts and criminal acts that violate the Criminal Law, to ensure the healthy development of the fight against economic crimes.

Currently, economic crimes are rampant, and they must be severely cracked down on. We require courts at all levels to focus on: 1. Strictly implementing the Criminal Law and the Supplementary Provisions of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on the Punishment of Embezzlement and Bribery Crimes, and focusing on combating embezzlement and bribery; 2. Speculation crimes seriously disrupt the social economic order and must be resolutely punished. Whether individuals or enterprises, institutions, organizations, or units engage in speculation, if the circumstances are serious and constitute a crime, they must be held criminally responsible; 3. For other economic crimes such as smuggling, drug trafficking, fraud, tax evasion, counterfeit trademarks, and the production and sale of counterfeit and substandard goods, they must also be severely punished according to law.

The national political and legal work conference held in January this year clearly pointed out that for serious crimes that disrupt the economy, the policy of severely punishing according to law must be continued; all law enforcement departments should unify their thinking, raise their awareness, coordinate their efforts, and strictly handle cases according to legal provisions, overcoming the phenomenon of "punishing instead of criminal punishment." To solve the problem of unclear policy and legal boundaries in handling speculation cases involving enterprises, institutions, organizations, and units, the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate recently jointly issued the "Provisions on Handling Speculation Cases Involving Enterprises, Institutions, Organizations, and Units at Present." This provides judicial interpretations on how to apply the law. We hope that people's congresses at all levels and their standing committees will strengthen supervision to ensure that cases that should be transferred to judicial organs according to law are promptly transferred, and the People's Court will definitely severely punish serious economic criminals according to law, ensuring that the law is strictly enforced, the enforcement is strict, and violations are investigated.

Crimes that endanger social order and disrupt the economy, as a social phenomenon, will exist for a long time in our country's socialist primary stage. In the process of transition from the old system to the new, with the socialist commodity economy order not yet established and perfected, various negative and unstable factors that induce illegal and criminal activities increase. Domestic and foreign hostile forces and elements will also take advantage of our difficulties and problems to cause trouble and sabotage. Therefore, in the next relatively long period, we must continue to adhere to the policy of "one hand to build, one hand to enforce the law." The state's dictatorship function cannot be abandoned. Fighting against crimes and maintaining social order is a long-term, arduous, and complex task. The criminal trial work of the People's Court must continue to be strengthened to ensure and promote the smooth progress of reform and construction.

(2) On civil trials

In 1988, courts across the country handled 14,551,300 civil cases, an increase of 19.9% over the previous year; concluded 14,190,560 cases, an increase of 18.6% over the previous year. The significant increase in civil cases reflects the changes in people's production, living methods, and concepts after the deepening of reform and the development of the commodity economy, as well as the adjustment of interests among all sectors of society and the expansion of civil rights.

In 1988, courts across the country handled 6,322,780 divorce cases, which still accounted for the highest proportion in civil cases, at 43.5%. Divorce cases prominently reflect the changes in people's marriage and family concepts in the new situation. On one hand, there is an increase in those who pursue marriage freedom and gender equality, and on the other hand, there is an increase in those who get married lightly and then propose divorce lightly. At the same time, in the identification of the nature of property involved in divorce and the division of property, many complex situations have emerged, with large disputes between the parties and difficulties in execution. The People's Court handles divorce cases based on the principle of protecting the legitimate rights and interests of women and children and punishing illegal acts, ensuring marriage freedom, opposing light divorce, and taking the breakdown of feelings as the standard for deciding whether to divorce or not, to maintain the socialist marriage and family system.

In recent years, debt cases have seen the largest increase in civil cases. In 1988, courts across the country handled 3,764,400 debt cases, an increase of 46.8%, ranking second in civil cases. In debt cases, there have been changes in the increase in production and operational loans, large amounts, and high-interest rates. The People's Court protects civil loans and the interests of creditors according to law, actively supports the development of individual economy, maintains and promotes the circulation of funds, and restricts and eliminates usury. To bring civil loans under the rule of law, we suggest that before the state formulates civil loan laws, provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government formulate local regulations based on needs and possibilities.

In 1988, courts across the country handled 1,055,410 cases involving disputes over houses, land, and forests. After the reform of the housing system and the paid transfer of land use rights, these types of cases have significantly increased. The People's Court handles cases involving disputes over houses, land, and forests according to law, protecting the ownership, management rights, and use rights of the state, collectives, and individuals, and punishing illegal activities and the illegal occupation and misuse of state and collective land.

Since the implementation of the General Principles of Civil Law, cases involving copyright, reputation rights, and portrait rights have been increasing, with 2,775 cases handled in 1988, of which copyright cases increased by 61.3% compared to the previous year. The People's Court handles these types of cases, both protecting the legitimate civil rights of citizens from being infringed upon and supporting legitimate social public opinion supervision. For those that constitute defamation and infringement of copyright, civil responsibility is pursued according to law, and necessary civil sanctions are given. Based on the needs of judicial practice in recent years, we hope that the Copyright Law and the Press Law will be enacted as soon as possible.

In the past two years, exchanges between the mainland and Taiwan regions have increased. According to incomplete statistics, in 1988, courts across the country handled 246 civil cases involving Taiwan. Based on the experience of handling civil cases involving Taiwan, the Supreme People's Court, in accordance with legal provisions and fully considering the historical fact of long-term separation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, has reasonably solved various civil disputes. In August last year, judicial interpretations were issued for handling civil cases involving marriage, inheritance, housing, and debts related to Taiwan. The correct handling of civil cases involving Taiwan has played an active role in protecting the civil rights of parties from both sides of the Taiwan Strait, strengthening economic and trade exchanges, and promoting personnel exchanges. The Taiwan authorities have recently also responded positively to some issues in civil lawsuits involving parties from both sides of the Taiwan Strait. Based on the development of the situation, we will further study the application of laws, investigation and evidence collection, and the delivery of lawsuit documents.

Over the past year, courts across the country have seriously implemented the General Principles of Civil Law, improving the quality and efficiency of case handling. The judicial interpretations issued by the Supreme People's Court on the implementation of the General Principles of Civil Law have played a promoting role in the correct implementation of the General Principles of Civil Law in judicial work. At the same time, many courts have actively explored and improved case acceptance, burden of proof, and court trial procedures, promoting the standardization of civil trial work.

(3) On economic trials

In 1988, courts across the country handled 513,615 economic dispute cases, an increase of 39.9% over the previous year. Among economic dispute cases, about 90% are economic contract dispute cases. Cases arising from exceeding the scope of business to sell important production materials and scarce consumer goods, using contracts to defraud advance payments, and other disputes account for a considerable proportion; cases of companies and enterprises pursuing overdue payments, as well as cases of debt settlement after company closure, continue to increase; cases of banks suing for the recovery of overdue loans have increased significantly, with 1,744,450 cases handled in 1988, an increase of 1.5 times over the previous year. With the deepening of reform, cases involving enterprise contracting or leasing operations, enterprise joint venture disputes, and enterprise bankruptcy, cases involving the infringement of patent rights or trademark exclusive rights, cases involving compensation for damages caused by the production and sale of counterfeit and substandard goods, and technical transfer contract disputes have all started to increase.

In 1988, courts across the country concluded 485,988 economic dispute cases, an increase of 33.2% over the previous year, with a dispute amount of over 11.8 billion yuan, making nearly 10 billion yuan of funds active again and re-enter circulation, playing an active role in maintaining economic order. Over the past year, many courts, especially grassroots courts, have conducted special trials in rural areas and industrial and mining enterprises, through the trial of economic dispute cases that are universal and have a significant impact on reform at that time and place, explaining the law through cases, combining trial and education, and combining treatment and prevention, with good effects. For example, some local courts have concentrated on handling a batch of loan contract cases, effectively promoting the recovery of agricultural loans, and according to incomplete statistics from some courts in Shanxi, Henan, Liaoning, and Shandong, 1 billion yuan of overdue loans have been recovered through litigation. Many courts have strengthened economic mediation work. Some local people's courts have also conducted new explorations on how to better carry out mediation work in the new situation of reform and opening up. This not only quickly resolved disputes, reduced the burden of litigation on the parties, but also facilitated execution, restored stalled economic and trade activities in a timely manner, promoted the normal circulation of funds and goods, and improved economic efficiency. We will summarize this aspect of experience and promote it.

Over the past year, courts across the country have concluded a number of foreign-related economic dispute cases, with some cases won by the Chinese party, some won by the foreign party, and some with both winning and losing. Because these cases were tried strictly in accordance with China's laws and international treaties that China has participated in, and with reference to international customs, treating Chinese and foreign parties equally, they have gained reputation and praise internationally. At the same time, courts across the country have also fairly tried a number of economic dispute cases involving Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. In the future, based on the summary of existing experience, we will further carry out foreign-related and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan-related economic trials, promoting the development of foreign and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan economic and trade, technological cooperation, and the implementation of the coastal economic development strategy.

Currently, the problem of difficult execution of judgments, rulings, and mediation agreements in economic dispute cases is still very prominent. Many cases involving debt settlement are difficult to handle. Some enterprises are seriously in the red and insolvent; some companies are liquidated and closed, and the opening units do not assume the responsibility of settling debts; some "four-nothing" companies have squandered the loans or advance payments. Some places and departments, in order to protect local or departmental interests, do not assist the People's Court in execution as required by law; some local courts also intentionally protect local parties and do not assist in the execution of cases entrusted by courts from other places. In the future, the People's Court must strictly enforce the law, eliminate the interference of local protectionism and departmentalism, and resolutely act according to law. For judgments, rulings, and mediation agreements that have already taken legal effect, after careful and detailed work, if the parties still refuse to execute, they must be forcibly executed according to law.

(4) On maritime trials

Since the National People's Congress Standing Committee decided to establish maritime courts in 1984, by the end of 1988, six maritime courts in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Qingdao, Tianjin, Dalian, and Wuhan had handled a total of 1,454 cases, concluded 1,233 cases, with a total claim amount of over 450 million yuan. The number of cases handled by maritime courts has been increasing year by year, with over 20 types of cases.

Over the past four years, maritime courts have handled 146 foreign-related cases, involving more than 30 countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and North and South America, with some cases involving foreign parties on both sides. In handling foreign-related cases, maritime courts have adhered to the principles of seeking truth from facts, fairness and reasonableness, and equal application of laws to domestic and foreign parties, strictly handling cases according to law, maintaining China's judicial jurisdiction, and protecting the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese and foreign parties.

Maritime trials involve many domestic laws and regulations, as well as many international conventions and customs. China has joined international conventions related to maritime collision avoidance, maritime safety of life, civil liability for oil pollution damage, and prevention of ship pollution. At the same time, the Supreme People's Court has, according to the needs of maritime trials, issued judicial interpretations on foreign-related maritime litigation jurisdiction, pre-trial seizure of ships, and compulsory sale of seized ships to settle debts. To further carry out maritime trials and better serve reform, opening up, and the coastal economic development strategy, we suggest that, according to needs, some relevant international conventions should be joined, and we hope that the Maritime Law currently being drafted will be promulgated as soon as possible.

Over the past four years, maritime trials have achieved certain results, playing an active role in maintaining maritime order, protecting the marine environment, and promoting the development of maritime affairs and foreign economic and trade. China has a long coastline and many ports. With the development of the situation, the maritime trial tasks will become heavier, and the existing six maritime courts cannot meet the needs; at the same time, due to the imperfect system, there are some problems in the trial of appeals and the supervision of maritime trials. Therefore, we plan to establish maritime courts in some port cities of coastal economic special zones; improve the appeal system, strengthen maritime trial institutions; at the same time, maritime courts will, according to needs, dispatch circuit courts to handle cases on the spot, facilitate litigation, and improve maritime law enforcement levels.

(5) On administrative trials

So far, China has more than 130 laws and administrative regulations stipulating that citizens and organizations can sue to the court if they are not satisfied with the handling of administrative organs, and a large number of local regulations have also made similar provisions. The number of administrative cases sued to the People's Court has been increasing year by year. Since 1986, the People's Court has gradually established administrative trial divisions, with 26 high-level courts, 242 intermediate courts (accounting for 63.5% of the total number of intermediate courts), and 1,154 grassroots courts (accounting for 39% of the total number of grassroots courts) having established administrative trial divisions. The Supreme People's Court also established an administrative trial division last year.

Over the past two years, courts across the country have handled a total of 14,513 administrative cases, involving many administrative management departments such as public security, land, customs, food hygiene, medicine, environmental protection, industry and commerce, and taxation. In the past two years, courts across the country have concluded 13,428 administrative cases, of which 6,698 cases upheld the original administrative decisions, accounting for 49.9%; 3,354 cases were withdrawn, accounting for 25%; 1,321 cases revoked the original administrative decisions, accounting for 9.8%; 674 cases changed or partially changed the original administrative decisions, accounting for 5%. Practice has proven that the People's Court, through the trial of administrative cases, has protected the legitimate rights and interests of citizens and organizations, supported administrative organs in exercising their powers according to law, and is conducive to promoting the standardization and legalization of administrative management.

Since this is a new litigation system, some citizens and organizations are not familiar with it or are not accustomed to it, and some do not know how to use the rights granted by the state law to protect their legitimate rights and interests; some organs do not want to appear in court or do not execute the court's judgment; some judges also have varying degrees of difficulty in dealing with the situation. These problems will gradually be solved with the continuous improvement of the administrative litigation system and the strengthening of legal awareness.

The Administrative Litigation Law (draft) to be reviewed by this session of the National People's Congress is an important legal draft, an important achievement of China's political system reform, and an important sign of the continuous improvement of China's socialist democracy and legal system. After the Administrative Litigation Law is enacted, courts at all levels will seriously study and implement it, further establish and improve administrative trial institutions, train administrative trial officials, and improve law enforcement levels. The Supreme People's Court will also propose measures for the specific implementation of the Administrative Litigation Law, actively, prudently, and comprehensively carry out administrative trial work.

(6) On handling complaints and appeals

In 1988, courts across the country handled 3,570,685 letters of various types, received 4,175,204 visits, of which 59.4% were complaints, 25.6% were appeals against judgments that have taken legal effect in previous years, and 15% were not under the jurisdiction of the court. The People's Court, according to the judicial supervision procedure, conducted retrials of 119,315 criminal cases (74,339 cases upheld the original judgment, and 3,113 cases were retried), and 16,315 civil and economic cases (9,040 cases upheld the original judgment, and 2,947 cases were retried). Through the handling of complaints, appeals, and retrials, especially the retrial and correction of cases that were clearly wrongly judged, the litigation rights and legitimate rights and interests of citizens were protected, the seriousness of state laws was maintained, and social stability and unity were promoted.

Over the past year, courts across the country have also handled some appeals involving Taiwan, including 197 criminal appeals and 26 civil appeals. The People's Court, based on laws and policies towards Taiwan, has seriously reviewed historical old cases involving people who went to Taiwan, and corrected those that were clearly wrongly judged. This has had a positive impact on increasing mutual understanding and friendship between the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, promoting the "three links," and achieving the great cause of national reunification. Some Taiwanese compatriots and relatives are very grateful and have expressed their willingness to contribute to the reunification of the motherland and the revitalization of China.

In 1988, the number of letters and visits received by courts across the country regarding complaints, appeals, and non-litigation matters decreased compared to previous years. The main reasons are: the task of implementing policies in criminal trials has been completed; the quality of various trial work has improved to varying degrees; the handling of complaints and appeals has been further strengthened. However, the current number of letters and visits is still large, the situation is complex, and the tasks facing us are still heavy. Therefore, courts at all levels must pay great attention to establishing and improving the people's appeal system, ensuring that the rights and freedoms of citizens as stipulated in the Constitution are protected, and at the same time, stopping the abuse of rights and freedoms according to law, resolutely overcoming bureaucratic tendencies, seriously implementing the principle of graded responsibility, and striving to improve the quality and efficiency of handling complaints and appeals. For those that meet the acceptance conditions, they should be accepted according to law; for those that are clearly wrong in fact-finding and legal application, they should be corrected in a timely manner according to the principle of seeking truth from facts and correcting mistakes; for those that are unreasonable, they should do a good job in persuading the parties to accept the judgment and stop the appeal.

II. To adapt to the needs of trial tasks in the new situation, the court has strengthened its reform and construction

(1) Improving law enforcement activities and raising law enforcement levels

The 14th National Court Work Conference emphasized that courts at all levels should strive to improve law enforcement activities, fully and accurately implement the Constitution and laws, and further improve law enforcement levels. Progress has been made in this regard over the past year.

The Constitution of China stipulates that the People's Court exercises judicial power independently according to the provisions of the law. The Thirteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China clearly proposed to "improve law enforcement activities and ensure that judicial organs exercise their powers independently according to law," and the work points of the Seventh National People's Congress Standing Committee proposed that the Standing Committee should, through legal supervision, ensure that judicial organs exercise their powers independently according to law. The constitutional principle of the People's Court exercising judicial power independently is increasingly recognized by all sectors of society, and the law enforcement activities of the People's Court are receiving more respect and support. However, currently, there are still some People's Courts, mainly grassroots People's Courts, whose trial work is interfered with; and some judges cannot enforce the law according to legal provisions, adhere to principles, and act impartially. We believe that the key to adhering to independent trials according to law is that courts at all levels should dare to adhere to the principle of seeking truth from facts and acting according to law, and independently make judgments. When lower-level courts encounter difficulties in law enforcement, they should report to higher-level courts, and higher-level courts should provide timely and effective support and assistance. We hope that people's congresses at all levels and their standing committees will further strengthen supervision over whether the People's Court can adhere to independent trials according to law.

The Constitution of China stipulates that the Supreme People's Court supervises the trial work of local courts at all levels and special courts, and higher-level courts supervise the trial work of lower-level courts. In recent years, the Supreme People's Court and higher-level courts have strengthened judicial supervision. On one hand, for judgments and rulings that have already taken legal effect and are found to be incorrect, they are retried or ordered to be retried by lower-level courts according to the judicial supervision procedure, and corrected in a timely manner. On the other hand, due to the current incompleteness of China's laws, there are many new situations and problems in judicial work, and there are sometimes obstacles in law enforcement, lower-level courts report some cases involving the boundaries of crime and non-crime, policy boundaries, especially a few major and difficult cases with unclear boundaries to the Supreme People's Court or higher-level courts, and the Supreme People's Court or higher-level courts study them in a timely manner, mainly providing opinions on the application of laws. The specific handling of cases is still carried out by lower-level courts according to legal procedures, after court trials, based on the facts confirmed in court, and strictly according to law. The practice over the past few years has proven that this approach not only does not affect the independent exercise of judicial power by lower-level courts, nor does it affect the parties' exercise of litigation rights according to law, but also helps to improve law enforcement levels and case quality.

Over the past year, courts across the country have further seriously implemented the system of public trials according to law, and many courts have listed improving public trials as a key point in their own reform and business construction. In the past, some judges, including some court leaders, did not fully recognize the importance of public trials, and some cases that should have been tried publicly according to law were not tried publicly, and some, although tried publicly, were merely formalities, affecting the seriousness of law enforcement. Over the past year, we have emphasized that public trials are an important system stipulated by the Constitution of China, requiring courts at all levels to raise their awareness, strive to overcome difficulties such as a large number of cases, insufficient personnel, and lack of courtrooms, and vigorously improve public trials. Currently, first-instance cases are basically tried publicly according to law, and some important second-instance and retrial cases are also tried publicly according to law. Practice has proven that public trials not only truly protect the litigation rights of trial participants but also promote the implementation of a series of trial systems such as recusal, defense (debate), and appeal, improving the quality of court trials. Public trials reflect the openness and transparency of trial work, ensuring the fair and just handling of cases according to law; at the same time, they are also conducive to conducting vivid and specific legal publicity and education, preventing and reducing the occurrence of crimes and disputes.

(2) Strengthening and supplementing the court team, gradually establishing a socialist judge system with Chinese characteristics

In 1988, courts across the country, according to the state's approval of the court system's increase in personnel, and in accordance with the proposal of the report on the work of the Supreme People's Court at the First Session of the Seventh National People's Congress, which was approved by the Seventh National People's Congress, implemented the practice of "preferring quality over quantity, unified examination, selecting the best, and high-level courts screening," and actively and prudently carried out the work of increasing personnel. By the end of the year, more than 30,000 people had been added. Overall, the quality of the new personnel is good. This year, more than 10,000 people will be transferred to work in the courts, and how to screen the new personnel remains a very important task. The quality of the new personnel directly affects the quality of the court team. We will continue to adhere to the above effective practices. We hope that party committees, people's congresses and their standing committees, and governments at all levels will continue to support and help the courts screen the new personnel.

The Thirteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed that the leaders and staff of judicial organs should be managed in a manner similar to that of state civil servants, and that the principles of separating party and government affairs, and combining the management of people and affairs in a reasonable and restrained manner should be implemented, to implement scientific classification management. According to this requirement, we are currently drafting the Judge Law. The enactment of the Judge Law is a major reform of the current management system of court trial personnel, aiming to better ensure the improvement of the quality of the judicial team and better guarantee the independent exercise of judicial power by the courts. Therefore, we plan to establish a complete set of judge management systems suitable for the characteristics of judicial work from the aspects of judge qualifications, examinations, appointments, assessments, promotions, training, rewards and punishments, treatment, and management, to gradually establish a high-level judge team that can adapt to the needs of reform, opening up, and construction. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has included the Judge Law in the legislative plan for the next two years, and we will draft the Judge Law as soon as possible and submit it to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for review.

(3) Gradually establishing a multi-level, standardized court cadre education and training system

To adapt to the new situation of reform and opening up and the comprehensive development of trial work, the Supreme People's Court has taken a series of measures to reform and strengthen the education and training of court cadres, and vigorously improve the political and professional qualities of trial personnel.

In 1985, the Supreme People's Court established the National Court Cadres Part-time University of Law, providing systematic higher legal professional education for court cadres. Last year, more than 29,000 graduates of the first batch of students graduated. This batch of graduates, together with the ordinary college graduates assigned to the court system by the state last year and the court cadres who graduated from other adult colleges, increased the number of court cadres with college degrees from 15% in 1987 to 30%, accelerating the process of knowledge-based and professionalized court cadres. In February 1988, the Supreme People's Court, in collaboration with the State Education Commission, established the China Senior Judge Training Center, and the first batch of senior-level judicial cadres and law master's degree students enrolled in September last year. Some high-level courts are also actively preparing to establish judge training centers to undertake on-the-job training tasks. Some high-level courts have commissioned ordinary colleges to offer undergraduate education starting from the junior college level. Starting from the autumn of last year, the court system across the country has carried out "Legal (Judicial) Professional Certificate" education, with more than 20,000 court cadres participating in the study. Last year, courts across the country also conducted short-term training for more than 30,000 court cadres through various types of training classes.

In this way, through various forms and channels of education and training such as college diploma education, undergraduate education, professional certificate education, and postgraduate continuing education, it is expected that by 1995, 70% of court cadres, 80% of trial personnel, and 90% of court presidents and vice-presidents across the country will have a college degree or above in legal professionalism, and a number of judges with double bachelor's degrees and master's and doctoral degrees in law will be cultivated. This will fundamentally change the historical situation of low cultural and professional qualities of court cadres, laying the foundation for the full implementation of the Judge Law. We plan to gradually establish the China Judges College on the basis of the current National Court Cadres Part-time University of Law and the China Senior Judge Training Center, similar to the National Administrative College, to establish a standardized judge education and training system.

(4) Strictly managing the court, maintaining the integrity of the People's Court

According to the requirements of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on "the party and state organs must maintain integrity," over the past year, we have taken integrity construction as a key point in "strictly managing the court," mainly by: regularly conducting ideological, situational, and professional ethics education; establishing and improving management systems, strictly enforcing financial discipline; further improving the transparency of court work, voluntarily accepting supervision; and seriously investigating and dealing with internal illegal and disciplinary cases. In 1988, according to the provisions of the "Interim Measures for Rewards and Punishments in the People's Court System," 4,135 collective units and 24,840 individuals in the court system were commended and rewarded. These advanced collective units and individuals include those who dared to resist pressure, eliminate interference, and insist on handling cases according to law; those who resisted corruption, maintained integrity, and acted impartially; and those who worked diligently, did not seek personal gain, were willing to make contributions, and achieved outstanding results. This is the mainstream of the 220,000-strong court team. However, there are indeed a few people in the court team who cannot withstand the test of reform and opening up, cannot withstand the temptation of money, and are infiltrated by decadent thoughts, committing illegal and disciplinary acts and even crimes, seriously damaging the reputation of judicial organs and the image of judicial personnel. We will not tolerate illegal and criminal acts and will investigate and deal with them seriously once discovered. According to statistics, in 1988, 383 court personnel (including 164 judges) were disciplined for illegal and disciplinary acts; 18 people (including 6 judges) were held criminally responsible according to law for violating the Criminal Law.

Maintaining the integrity of the People's Court is a major issue related to the impartial administration of justice by judicial organs. The Supreme People's Court plans to hold a national court integrity work conference in the first half of this year to further exchange experiences, commend advanced units, strengthen discipline, improve systems, and build a clean and impartial team to better complete the various tasks entrusted to the People's Court.

(5) Accelerating courtroom construction and improving law enforcement conditions

Over the past year, due to the attention and support of local party committees, people's congresses, and governments, the construction of courtrooms in the People's Court has made new progress. Courtrooms are important venues for the People's Court to exercise judicial power according to law and are basic conditions that must be met for carrying out trial work. In October last year, the Supreme People's Court and the State Planning Commission further studied the situation of courtroom construction in courts at all levels. The State Council issued a special document, requiring local governments to actively support and properly arrange for the construction of local courtrooms as soon as possible. After the issuance of this document, it has been implemented in many places. We require local courts to make plans and, with the support of local governments, to basically complete the construction of courtrooms within three years, and large and medium-sized cities and coastal open areas should be faster.

Over the past year, the business funds of some courts have improved, but the shortage of funds is still a common problem. Grassroots courts, especially those in poor, remote, and border areas, face greater difficulties and cannot meet the needs of case handling, making some cases that should be accepted not accepted and some that should be investigated not investigated. Therefore, we hope that governments and financial departments at all levels will increase funding to ensure the necessary case-handling funds for courts; poor counties should receive case-handling fund subsidies from higher-level financial departments; at the same time, the emergency equipment, working conditions, and living conditions of courts should also be guaranteed.

(6) Strengthening grassroots construction and improving grassroots work

Currently, there are 3,014 grassroots courts and 17,273 people's courts nationwide. If the trial work of grassroots courts and their dispatched people's courts is well done, the trial work of courts across the country will have a solid foundation, which is also important for implementing the comprehensive treatment of social order. Last year, we added personnel, most of whom were assigned to grassroots courts and people's courts, and we also adjusted and strengthened some incomplete people's courts, and created working and business learning conditions for people's court personnel as much as possible to better play the role of people's courts. However, we have not done enough in strengthening grassroots work, especially the work of people's courts, and their working conditions are still very difficult. We will further investigate and study, and at an appropriate time, hold a meeting on the work of people's courts to strengthen the work of people's courts and strive for significant changes in the grassroots work of courts this year.

According to legal provisions, the People's Court should provide business guidance to people's mediation committees. Currently, the organization of some local people's mediation committees is incomplete, and some grassroots courts have relaxed their business guidance to mediation committees, which urgently needs to be rectified and strengthened. The Supreme People's Court will, in collaboration with relevant departments, take effective measures to improve people's mediation committees, strengthen the work of mediating and resolving mass disputes, and timely and properly resolve a large number of mass disputes, preventing and reducing illegal and criminal acts.

(7) Carrying out judicial assistance with foreign courts

The Civil Procedure Law of China stipulates, "According to the international treaties concluded or acceded to by the People's Republic of China, or according to the principle of reciprocity, the People's Court and foreign courts can entrust each other to perform certain litigation acts." So far, China has recognized and participated in more than 50 international treaties related to judicial work, such as the "United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods," the "Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property," and the "Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards"; signed investment protection agreements with more than 20 countries including Romania, Thailand, Britain, and the Netherlands; signed judicial assistance agreements with France, Poland, and Belgium, and is negotiating judicial assistance agreements with some countries. In February last year, the Supreme People's Court issued the "Notice on the Implementation of Judicial Assistance Agreements" to local courts at all levels, requiring them to seriously implement the signed judicial assistance agreements. The Supreme People's Court will continue to actively participate in the negotiation of judicial assistance agreements and do a good job in judicial assistance. This is not only the need for the trial work of the courts but also helps to promote the development of Sino-foreign economic and trade, scientific and technological cooperation, and cultural exchanges.

Comrades,

Over the past year, the trial work of courts across the country has achieved certain results, and the reform and construction of the courts themselves have also made significant progress. This is the result of the joint efforts of courts at all levels under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the supervision and support of the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee. At the same time, the Supreme People's Court also has some shortcomings in its work, mainly: first, the investigation and research on the new situations and problems facing the work of courts across the country are not deep and systematic enough, and the macro-guidance of court work needs to be further strengthened; second, the supervision and inspection of the trial work of lower-level courts are not enough, and the quality and efficiency of case handling need to be further improved; third, the political and ideological education of court cadres is not strong enough, and the phenomenon of lax discipline and sluggish work style in some cadres needs to be further strengthened in management and education. We will take effective measures to correct these shortcomings.

Over the past year, the Supreme People's Court has repeatedly reported its work to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, actively accepting the supervision of the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee, and requiring local courts at all levels to voluntarily accept the supervision of the people's congresses and their standing committees. The people's congresses and their standing committees at all levels have strengthened their supervision of the courts, which has greatly supported the work of the courts. The People's Court will face more arduous tasks in the future. We sincerely hope that the people's congresses and their standing committees at all levels will continue to strengthen their supervision and support of the People's Court. We will continue to work hard to do a good job in trial work, actively serve the rectification of the economic environment, the rectification of the economic order, and the comprehensive deepening of reform, and serve the construction of socialist material and spiritual civilization.

　　最高人民法院工作报告
    ——１９８９年３月２９日在第七届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上
    最高人民法院院长  任建新各位代表：
    一年来，最高人民法院以中国共产党第十三次全国代表大会提出的社会主义初级阶段理论和基本路线为指导，履行宪法和法律赋予的职责，努力发挥国家审判机关依法惩治犯罪、保护人民、促进改革、保障四化的职能作用。现将工作的主要情况报告如下，请予审议。
    一、为维护社会安定、保障治理整顿和深化改革，大力开展各项审判工作
    （一）关于刑事审判工作
    １９８８年，全国各级人民法院受理刑事案件３１．３３０６万件，比上年增加８．２％；审结３１．２４７５万件，比上年增加７％；判处被告人３６．８７９０万名，比上年增加１３％。其中，判处５年以上有期徒刑、无期徒刑和死刑（包括死缓）的有１１．３５３３万名，占３０．８％，比上年增加１４．２％；判处５年以下有期徒刑、拘役、管制和免予刑事处分的有２５．３２１８万名，占６８．７％，比上年增加１２．７％；宣告无罪的有２０３９名。全国法院对严重危害社会治安的犯罪分子，继续贯彻执行了依法从重从快惩处的方针；对有法定从轻、减轻情节的，依法从轻、减轻处罚。１９８８年，全国法院依法宣告缓刑的有２．７９９４万人；对在服刑中确有悔改、立功表现的罪犯，依法减刑、假释的有１５．１５３８万人；受理人民检察院抗诉的案件２０３０件，审结２０００件，经过审理，认为原判确实不当而依法改判的７３７件，占３６．９％。
    当前，全国社会治安基本稳定，但不安定因素增多，我们面临的形势还是相当严峻的。全国法院受理的重大刑事案件大量增加。１９８８年，全国法院受理的故意杀人案件比１９８７年增加９．１％，抢劫案件增加４３．１％，重大盗窃案件增加６３．８％。流窜犯很猖獗，在大中城市、交通干线和沿海开放地区，流窜犯作案在全部刑事案件中占很大的比重，有的地方高达５０％以上。社会丑恶现象诱发的犯罪，在一些地方相当严重。因此，人民法院对杀人犯、抢劫犯、重大盗窃犯、强奸犯等严重危害社会治安的犯罪分子，要继续贯彻依法从重从快惩处的方针，特别要注意打击犯罪集团和流窜作案的主犯、累犯、惯犯等严重犯罪分子。各级人民法院要积极参加对社会治安进行专项治理的斗争，对当地比较突出的违法犯罪活动进行集中打击和集中整顿。特别是大中城市、交通干线和沿海开放地区的人民法院要积极同有关部门配合，把社会治安搞好，以达到稳定治安大局，力争实现今年全国治安状况好于去年的目标。
    近几年来在刑事案件中值得注意的一个问题是青少年犯罪不断增多。１９８８年判处的罪犯中，１４岁以上不满１８岁的未成年人占８．９％，比上年增加１３．８％。为加强对少年犯罪的综合治理，最高人民法院推广了上海、天津等地人民法院组织未成年人刑事案件合议庭的经验。对失足少年着眼于教育、感化和挽救，实行“寓教于审”；同时，注重同家长、学校、社会结合起来，进行疏导、防范，共同矫治失足少年的不良行为。这样做的效果比较好。我们提出今年要根据需要和可能，在大、中城市及沿海开放地区的基层人民法院和一部分中级人民法院，逐步建立未成年人刑事案件合议庭。我们希望青年组织、妇女组织和教育部门以及社会各有关方面，共同参加对少年违法犯罪的综合治理工作；希望通过立法并健全审判组织和程序，逐步完善我国矫治失足少年的司法制度。
    １９８８年，全国法院受理的刑事案件中，有经济犯罪案件５．５１８０万件，审结５．５７１０万件（含上年未结案），判处被告人７．４９２３万名。其中，判处贪污案件被告人８２４８名（贪污数额５万元以上不满１０万元的有１６６人，１０万元以上的有７３人，贪污数额最多的１人达３３４万元），判处受贿案件被告人１５８４名（受贿数额５万元以上不满１０万元的有９人，１０万元以上的有１２人）。贪污、受贿罪犯中被判处无期徒刑、死刑（包括死缓）的有１１１名。判处投机倒把案件被告人１６９９名，判处走私贩私案件被告人１９８名，判处偷税抗税案件被告人７８５名。从总体上看，全国法院对严重经济犯罪活动认真贯彻了依法从严惩处的方针，坚持了一要坚决、二要慎重、务必搞准的原则，注意严格区分工作失误同违法犯罪的界限，区分一般的违法行为同触犯刑法的犯罪行为的界限，以保证打击经济犯罪活动的斗争健康发展。
    当前，经济领域内的犯罪活动猖獗，必须继续严厉打击。我们要求各级人民法院要特别注意抓好：１、认真执行刑法和全国人大常委会《关于惩处贪污罪贿赂罪的补充规定》，把主要力量放在反贪污、反受贿上；２、投机倒把犯罪活动，对社会经济秩序危害很大，必须坚决予以惩治。无论是个人还是企事业单位、机关、团体进行投机倒把活动，情节严重，构成犯罪的，都要依法追究刑事责任；３、对于走私、贩毒、诈骗、偷税抗税、假冒商标、制售伪劣商品等其他经济犯罪活动，也必须依法严惩。
    今年１月全国政法工作座谈会明确指出，对于严重破坏经济的犯罪活动，必须继续坚持依法从严惩处的方针；各执法部门应统一思想，提高认识，协调一致，严格依照法律规定办事，克服“以罚代刑”的现象。为了解决在处理企业事业单位、机关、团体投机倒把犯罪案件中，政策、法律界限不够明确的问题，最高人民法院与最高人民检察院最近共同发出了《关于当前处理企业事业单位、机关、团体投机倒把犯罪案件的规定》，就如何适用法律问题作出司法解释。希望各级人大及其常委会加强监督，使依法应当追究刑事责任的案件得以及时移送司法机关，并起诉到人民法院；人民法院一定依法严惩严重经济犯罪分子，切实做到有法必依，执法必严，违法必究。
    危害社会治安和破坏经济的犯罪活动，作为一种社会现象，在我国社会主义初级阶段还会长期存在。在新旧体制交替过程中，在社会主义商品经济新秩序尚未建立、健全的情况下，诱发违法犯罪的各种社会消极因素和不安定因素增多。国内外敌对势力和敌对分子也会利用我们存在的困难和问题进行捣乱与破坏。因此，在今后一个相当长的时期里，还必须坚持“一手抓建设、一手抓法制”的方针。国家的专政职能不能丢。同犯罪作斗争，稳定社会治安，是一项长期、艰巨和复杂的任务，人民法院的刑事审判工作必须继续加强，以保障、促进改革和建设的顺利进行。
    （二）关于民事审判工作
    １９８８年，全国法院受理民事案件１４５．５１３０万件，比上年增加１９．９％；审结１４１．９０５６万件，比上年增加１８．６％。民事案件大幅度上升，反映了改革深化、商品经济发展后，人们生产、生活方式和观念的变化，反映了社会各方面利益的调整和民事权益的扩大。
    １９８８年，全国法院受理离婚案件６３．２２７８万件，在民事案件中仍居首位，占４３．５％。离婚案件突出表现了在新形势下人们婚姻、家庭观念的变化，一方面追求婚姻自由、男女平等的多了，另一方面第三者插足或轻率结婚而又轻率提出离婚的也多了。同时，在离婚涉及的财产性质的认定、财产的分割等方面出现了许多复杂情况，双方争议大，执行困难。人民法院审理离婚案件，本着有利于保护妇女、儿童合法权益和制裁违法行为的原则，保障婚姻自由，反对轻率离婚，把感情是否确已破裂作为判决离与不离的标准，以维护社会主义婚姻家庭制度。
    近几年来，债务案件在民事案件中上升幅度一直最大。１９８８年，全国法院受理债务案件３７．６４４０万件，比上年增加４６．８％，居民事案件的第二位。在债务案件中，出现了生产、经营性借贷多，金额大，利率高等方面的变化。人民法院依法保护民间正当的借贷关系和债权人的利益，积极扶植个体经济的发展，维护和促进资金的流转，限制和取缔高利盘剥。为了使民间借贷纳入法制的轨道，我们建议在国家制定民间借贷法律以前，由省、自治区、直辖市人大根据需要和可能，制定地方性法规。
    １９８８年，全国法院受理房屋、土地、山林纠纷案件１０．５５４１万件。住房制度实行改革和土地使用权实行有偿转让后，这几类案件明显增多。人民法院审理房屋、土地、山林纠纷案件，依法保护国家、集体和个人的所有权、经营权、使用权，制裁利用房屋、土地进行非法活动和侵占、滥用国家、集体土地的行为。
    民法通则实施以来，著作权、名誉权、肖像权等案件日益增多，１９８８年受理２７７５件，其中著作权案件就比上年上升６１．３％。人民法院审理这几类案件，既坚持有利于保护公民的合法民事权益不受侵害，又支持正当的社会舆论监督。对构成损害名誉权、侵害著作权的，依法追究其相应的民事责任，给予必要的民事制裁。根据近年来审判实践发展的需要，我们希望早日制定著作权法和新闻法。
    近两年来，我国台湾地区与大陆地区民间往来增多。据不完全统计，１９８８年，全国法院受理涉台民事案件２４６件。最高人民法院在总结审理涉台民事案件经验的基础上，依据法律规定，并充分考虑到海峡两岸人民长期隔绝的历史事实，合情合理地解决各类民事纠纷，于去年８月就审理婚姻、继承、房屋、债务等涉台民事案件作出了司法解释。涉台民事案件的正确处理，对保护海峡两岸当事人的民事权益，加强经济贸易和人员往来，起了积极的作用。台湾当局最近也就涉及海峡两岸当事人的民事诉讼中的某些问题作出了积极的反应。根据形势的发展，我们将进一步在适用法律、调查取证、送达诉讼文书等方面进行研究。
    一年来，全国法院认真贯彻民法通则，提高了办案质量和效率。最高人民法院作出《关于贯彻执行〈中华人民共和国民法通则〉若干问题的意见》的司法解释后，对在审判工作中正确贯彻执行民法通则起了推动作用。与此同时，许多法院在案件受理、举证责任、开庭审理等方面进行了积极的探索与改进，促进了民事审判工作的规范化。
    （三）关于经济审判工作
    １９８８年，全国法院受理经济纠纷案件５１．３６１５万件，比上年增加３９．９％。在经济纠纷案件中，约有９０％是经济合同纠纷案件。因超越经营范围倒卖重要生产资料和紧俏消费品、利用合同骗取预付货款等引起纠纷的案件占相当比重；公司、企业间追偿拖欠货款的案件，以及公司停办后的债务清偿案件继续增多；银行诉请追回逾期贷款的案件更是大量增加，１９８８年受理了１７．４４４５万件，比上年增加了１．５倍。随着改革的深入发展，企业承包或租赁经营、企业联营纠纷和企业破产的案件，侵犯专利权或商标专用权的案件，制售伪劣商品造成损害的赔偿案件，以及技术转让合同纠纷案件等，都开始增多。
    １９８８年，全国法院共审结经济纠纷案件４８．５９８８万件，比上年增加３３．２％，审理争议金额１１８亿多元，使近１００亿元的资金由死变活，重新投入运转，对维护经济秩序起了积极作用。一年来，许多法院特别是基层法院深入农村和工矿企业开展专项审判，通过审理在当时当地带普遍性的、对改革有较大影响的经济纠纷案件，就案讲法，审教结合，治防结合，效果很好。例如，有的地方法院集中审理一批借款合同案件，有力地促进了农贷回收工作的开展，仅据山西、河南、辽宁、山东等部分法院的不完全统计，通过诉讼追回逾期贷款达１０亿元。许多法院加强了经济调解工作。有些地方的人民法院还就在改革、开放的新形势下如何更好地开展调解工作进行了新的探索。这不仅较快地解决了纠纷，减少了当事人的讼累，而且有利于执行，使陷于停滞的经济贸易活动及时恢复经营，促进了资金和商品的正常运转，提高了经济效益。我们将总结这方面的经验，加以推广。
    一年来，全国法院审结了一批涉外经济纠纷案件，有中方当事人胜诉的，也有外国当事人胜诉的，还有各有胜负的。由于审理这些案件严格依照了我国的法律和我国参加的国际条约，并参照了国际惯例，对中外当事人一视同仁，在国际上获得了信誉与好评。同时，全国法院还依法公正地审结了一批涉港、澳、台的经济纠纷案件。今后要在总结已有经验的基础上，进一步开展涉外和涉港、澳、台经济审判工作，促进对外和对港、澳、台的经济贸易、技术合作的发展和沿海地区经济发展战略的实施。
    目前经济纠纷案件的判决、裁定和调解协议执行难的问题仍非常突出。不少有关清偿债务的案件很难处理。有一些企业严重亏损，资不抵债；有些公司被清理停办后，开办单位不承担清偿债务的责任；更有一些“四无”公司将贷款或预付货款挥霍浪费殆尽。有些地方、有些部门，为了保护本地、本部门的利益，依法应当协助人民法院执行的不予协助；也有的地方法院有意袒护本地当事人一方，对外地法院委托执行的不予协助。对这些问题，人民法院今后一定要严肃执法，排除地方保护主义和本位主义的干扰，坚决依法办事。对于已经发生法律效力的判决、裁定和调解协议，经过认真细致的工作，当事人仍拒不执行的，要严格依法强制执行。
    （四）关于海事审判工作
    自１９８４年全国人大常委会决定设立海事法院以来，至１９８８年底，上海、广州、青岛、天津、大连、武汉等六个海事法院共受理案件１４５４件，审结１２３３件，结案诉讼标的额为４．５亿多元。海事法院的收案数量逐年增多，案件类型已达２０多种。
    ４年来，海事法院共受理涉外案件１４６件，外国当事人涉及亚、欧、非、南北美洲的３０多个国家，其中有些案件双方当事人都是外国人。海事法院在办理涉外案件中，坚持了实事求是，公平合理，国内外当事人在适用法律上一律平等的原则，严格依法办案，维护了我国的司法管辖权，保护了中外当事人的合法权益。
    海事审判不仅涉及许多国内法律、法规，而且涉及许多国际公约和国际惯例。我国已加入有关海上避碰、海上人命安全、油污损害民事责任、防止船舶造成污染等国际公约。同时，最高人民法院还根据海事审判工作的需要，先后就有关涉外海事诉讼管辖、诉讼前扣押船舶、强制变卖被扣押船舶清偿债务等作出司法解释。为了进一步开展海事审判工作，更好地为改革、开放服务，为沿海地区经济发展战略服务，我们建议，根据需要还应参加一些有关的国际公约，同时希望正在起草的海商法早日颁布。
    ４年多来，海事审判工作取得了一定成绩，对维护航运秩序，保护海洋环境，促进航运事业和对外经济贸易的发展起了积极的作用。我国海岸线长，港口众多，随着形势的发展，海事审判任务会越来越重，现有的六个海事法院不能适应需要；同时，由于体制不健全，上诉案件的审理和对海事审判工作的监督都存在一些问题。因此，我们拟在某些沿海经济特区的港口城市增设海事法院；改进上诉体制，健全海事审判机构；同时，各海事法院根据需要派出巡回法庭，就地办案，便利诉讼，提高海事执法水平。
    （五）关于行政审判工作
    到目前为止，我国已有１３０多个法律和行政法规规定公民和组织不服行政机关处理可以向法院起诉，还有大量的地方法规也作了类似的规定。诉讼到人民法院的行政案件逐年增加。１９８６年以来，人民法院陆续建立行政审判庭，现已有２６个高级法院、２４２个中级法院（占中级法院总数的６３．５％）、１１５４个基层法院（占基层法院总数的３９％）建立了行政审判庭。最高人民法院也于去年建立了行政审判庭。
    全国法院两年来共受理行政案件１４５１３件，涉及治安、土地、海关、食品卫生、医药、环境保护、工商、税务等许多行政管理部门。这两年内，全国法院共审结行政案件１３４２８件，其中维持原行政决定的６６９８件，占４９．９％；撤诉的３３５４件，占２５％；撤销原行政决定的１３２１件，占９．８％；变更或部分变更原行政决定的６７４件，占５％。实践证明，人民法院通过对行政案件的审理，保障了公民和组织的合法权益，支持了行政机关依法行使职权，有利于促进行政管理的规范化和法制化。
    由于这是一项新的诉讼制度，有些公民和组织对它还不熟悉、不习惯，甚至还不知道运用国家法律赋予的这项权利来维护自身的合法权益；有的机关不愿意出庭应诉，或者不执行法院的判决；有些法院的审判人员也还程度不同地存在着畏难情绪。这些问题，随着行政诉讼制度的不断完善和法制观念的不断增强，必将会逐步得到解决。
    这次人民代表大会审议的行政诉讼法（草案），是一部重要的法律草案，是我国政治体制改革的一项重要成果，也是我国社会主义民主和法制日益完善的一个重要标志。行政诉讼法通过后，各级法院将认真学习和贯彻执行，进一步建立和健全行政审判机构，培训行政审判干部，提高执法水平。最高人民法院还将就具体贯彻实施行政诉讼法提出办法，积极、稳妥而又全面地开展行政审判工作。
    （六）关于处理告诉、申诉工作
    １９８８年，全国法院处理各类来信３５７．０６８５万件次，接待来访４１７．５２０４万人次。其中，告诉占５９．４％，对历年来发生法律效力的判决提出申诉的占２５．６％，不属法院管辖的占１５％。人民法院依照审判监督程序进行再审的刑事案件有１１．９３１５万件（维持原判的７．４３３９万件，改判的３．１１３４万件），再审的民事、经济案件有１．６３１５万件（维持原判的９０４０件，改判的２９４７件）。通过处理告诉、申诉和再审，特别是对那些确属错判案件的改判纠正，保护了公民的诉讼权利和合法权益，维护了国家法律的严肃性，促进了社会的安定团结。
    一年来，全国法院还处理了一些涉台申诉案件，其中刑事申诉１９７件，民事申诉２６件。人民法院依据法律和对台政策，本着实事求是的精神，对提出申诉的涉及去台人员的历史老案，继续认真地进行了复查，对确属错判的进行了纠正。这对于增进海峡两岸人民的相互理解和情谊，促进“三通”，早日实现祖国的统一大业，产生了积极影响。有些台胞、台属十分感激，表示要为统一祖国，振兴中华，竭尽心力，以遂夙愿。
    １９８８年全国法院收到的告诉、申诉和非诉的来信、来访，较前几年有所下降。主要原因是：刑事审判工作方面落实政策的任务已经完成；各项审判工作的质量有不同程度的提高；处理告诉、申诉的工作进一步加强。但是，目前来信来访的数量还很大，情况复杂，面临的任务仍很繁重。所以，各级人民法院要十分重视建立和健全人民申诉制度，使宪法规定的公民权利和自由得到保障，同时依法制止滥用权利和自由的行为，坚决克服官僚主义作风，认真落实分级负责的原则，努力提高处理告诉申诉工作的质量和效率。对符合受理条件的要依法立案；对认定事实和适用法律确有错误的案件，本着实事求是、有错必纠的原则，及时予以纠正；对无理申诉的，要认真做好服判息诉的工作。
    二、为适应新形势下审判任务的需要，加强了法院的改革和建设
    （一）改善执法活动，提高执法水平
    第１４次全国法院工作会议强调，各级法院要努力改善执法活动，全面地、准确地执行宪法和法律，进一步提高执法水平。一年来在这方面取得了明显的进展。
    我国宪法规定，人民法院依照法律规定独立行使审判权。党的十三大明确提出“改善执法活动，保障司法机关依法独立行使职权”，七届全国人大常委会工作要点中提出，人大常委会通过法律监督，要保证审判机关依法独立行使职权。人民法院依法独立审判的宪法原则愈来愈多地为社会各界所认识，人民法院的执法活动得到更多的尊重和支持。但目前仍有一些人民法院主要是基层人民法院的审判工作受到干扰；也有一些审判人员不能按照法律规定，坚持原则，秉公执法。我们认为，坚持依法独立审判，关键是各级法院要敢于坚持以事实为根据、以法律为准绳的原则，独立地作出判决。下级法院在执法过程中遇到了困难，要报告上级法院，上级法院要及时给予有力的支持和帮助。我们希望各级人大及其常委会对人民法院能否坚持依法独立审判进一步加强监督。
    我国宪法规定，最高人民法院监督地方各级人民法院和专门人民法院的审判工作，上级人民法院监督下级人民法院的审判工作。这几年，最高人民法院和上级法院加强了审判监督。一方面，对已经发生法律效力的判决、裁定发现确有错误时，依照审判监督程序，及时提审或者指令下级法院再审，予以纠正。另一方面，由于我国目前法律还不够完备，审判工作中新情况、新问题很多，执法中有时还有阻力等实际情况，下级法院就一些涉及罪与非罪、政策界限不清，特别是极少数影响重大的疑难案件向最高人民法院或上级法院报告，最高人民法院或上级法院及时研究，主要就适用法律问题提出意见。对案件的具体处理则由下级法院依照法定程序，经过开庭审理，根据庭审确认的事实，严格依法作出判决。几年来的实践证明，这样做不仅不影响下级法院依法独立行使审判权，也不影响当事人依法行使诉讼权利，而且对于提高执法水平，提高办案质量是有好处的。
    一年来，全国法院进一步认真执行了依法公开审判的制度，不少法院把搞好公开审判列为自身改革和业务建设的重点。过去有些审判人员包括一些法院的领导，对公开审判的重要意义认识不足，少数依法应当公开审理的案件没有公开审理，有的虽然公开审理，但流于形式，影响严肃执法。一年来，我们强调公开审判是我国宪法规定的一项重要制度，要求各级法院要提高认识，努力克服案件数量多、办案人员不足、缺少审判法庭等困难，大力搞好公开审判。目前，一审案件基本上依法实行了公开审理，一些重要的二审案件和再审案件也依法实行了公开审理。实践证明，实行公开审理，不仅切实保障了诉讼参与人的诉讼权利，而且带动了回避、辩护（辩论）、上诉等一系列审判制度的实行，提高了庭审质量。公开审判体现了审判工作的公开性和透明度，保证了案件的依法公正处理；同时，也有利于进行生动、具体的法制宣传教育，预防和减少犯罪与纠纷的发生。
    （二）充实和加强法院队伍，逐步建立具有中国特色的社会主义法官制度
    １９８８年，全国法院根据国家批准法院系统增编的决定，按照七届全国人大一次会议批准的最高法院工作报告提出的“宁缺勿滥，统一考试，择优录用，高级法院把关”的做法，积极慎重地进行了增编进人工作。到年底，已进３万余人。总的来看，进人质量是好的。今年，还将有１万多人调进法院工作，如何把好进人关仍然是一项很重要的任务。进人质量直接关系到法院队伍的素质，我们将继续坚持上述有效的做法。我们希望各级党委、人大及其常委会和政府继续支持、帮助法院把好进人关。
    党的十三大提出，审判机关的领导人员和工作人员，要建立类似国家公务员的制度进行管理，要按照党政分开，管人与管事既紧密结合又合理制约的原则，实行科学的分类管理。根据这一要求，我们正在起草法官法。制定法官法，是对现行法院审判人员管理体制的重大改革，其目的在于能更好地保证审判队伍素质的提高，更好地保障法院依法独立行使审判权。因此，我们设想从法官的资格、考试、录用、选任、考核、晋升、培训、奖惩、待遇、管理等方面，建立一套完整的、适应审判工作特点的法官管理体制，以逐步建立起一支能适应改革、开放和建设需要的高水平的法官队伍。全国人大常委会已将法官法列入今明两年的立法规划，我们将尽快起草出法官法草案，提请全国人大常委会审议。
    （三）逐步建立多层次、正规化的法院干部教育培训体系
    为了适应改革、开放的新形势和全面开展审判工作的需要，最高人民法院采取一系列措施，改革和加强法院干部的教育培训工作，大力提高审判人员的政治、业务素质。
    １９８５年，最高人民法院创办了全国法院干部业余法律大学，对法院干部进行系统的高等法律专业学历教育。去年，已有２．９万多名首届学员毕业。这批学员的毕业，加上去年国家分配到法院系统的普通高等学校毕业生和在其他成人高等学校毕业的法院干部，使全国法院干部队伍中具有高等学校毕业学历的人数由１９８７年的１５％增加到了３０％，加速了法院干部队伍知识化、专业化的进程。
    １９８８年２月，最高人民法院与国家教委联合创办了中国高级法官培训中心，第一期高职级的审判干部和攻读法学硕士学位的学员已于去年９月入学。一些高级法院也正在积极筹建担负岗位培训任务的法官培训中心。部分高级法院委托普通高校举办了法律专业大专起点的本科教育。从去年秋季开始，全国法院系统开展了《法律（审判）专业证书》教育，有２万多名法院干部参加学习。去年，全国法院还通过举办各类短期培训班，对３万多名法院干部进行了岗位培训。
    这样，通过大专学历教育、本科学历教育、专业证书教育、大学后继续教育等多种方式、多种渠道的教育培训，预期到１９９５年，全国法院７０％的干部，８０％的审判人员，９０％的正、副院长将具有大专以上法律专业水平，并将培养出一批具有双学士学位和法学硕士、博士学位的法官。这将从整体上改变历史上形成的法院干部队伍文化、业务素质偏低的状况，为法官法的全面实施奠定基础。我们准备在现有的全国法院干部业余法律大学和中国高级法官培训中心的基础上，逐步办成类似国家行政学院的中国法官学院，以建立起正规化的法官教育培训体制。
    （四）从严治院，保持人民法院的清正廉洁
    根据中共中央关于“党和国家机关必须保持廉洁”的要求，一年来，我们把廉政建设作为“从严治院”的重点，主要做法是：经常进行理想教育、形势教育和职业道德教育；建立健全管理制度，严格财经纪律；进一步提高法院工作的透明度，自觉接受监督；严肃查处内部的违法违纪案件等。１９８８年，根据《人民法院奖惩暂行办法》的规定，法院系统受表彰奖励的集体４１３５个，立功受奖的个人２４８４０人次。这些先进集体和先进个人中，有勇于顶住压力，排除干扰，坚持依法办案的；有拒腐蚀，廉洁清正，秉公执法的；有兢兢业业，不计名利，甘愿奉献，成绩卓著的。这是２２万人的法院队伍的主流。但是，在法院队伍中，也确有极少数人经不起改革、开放的考验，经不起金钱的诱惑和腐朽思想的侵蚀而违法乱纪甚至犯罪，严重影响了审判机关的声誉，损害了人民法官的形象。我们对违法犯罪现象绝不姑息，一经发现，即严肃查处。据统计，１９８８年因违法乱纪受到纪律处分的法院干警３８３人（其中审判员１６４人）；因触犯刑法，被依法追究刑事责任的１８人（其中审判员６人）。
    保持人民法院的廉洁是关系到审判机关秉公执法的大问题。最高人民法院拟在今年上半年召开全国法院廉政工作会议，以进一步交流经验，表彰先进，加强纪律，健全制度，建设一支清正廉洁、秉公执法的队伍，更好地完成人民法院肩负的各项任务。
    （五）加快法庭建设，改善执法条件
    一年来，由于各地党委、人大常委会和政府的重视和支持，人民法院的审判法庭建设又有了新的进展。审判法庭是人民法院依法行使审判职权的重要场所，是开展审判工作必须具备的基本条件。去年１０月，最高人民法院与国家计委进一步研究了各级法院审判法庭建设的情况。国务院专门发出文件，要求各地人民政府积极支持，妥善安排，尽快把当地的审判法庭建设起来。这个文件下达后，已经在许多地方得到执行。我们要求各地法院作出规划，在当地政府的支持下，使审判法庭在３年内基本建成，大中城市和沿海开放地区应再快一些。
    一年来，法院的业务经费状况在有些地方有所改善，但经费短缺仍然是比较普遍存在的问题。基层法院特别是老少边困地区的法院困难更大，不能保证办案的需要，使一些案件该收的不能收，该查证的不能查证。因此希望各级政府和财政部门增加拨款，保证法院必要的办案经费；贫困县由上级财政部门给予办案经费补贴；同时，法院的应急装备、工作条件和生活条件也需要给予保障。
    （六）加强基层建设，改进基层工作
    现在全国有基层法院３０１４个，有人民法庭１７２７３个。基层法院及其派出机构人民法庭的审判工作做好了，全国法院的审判工作就有了坚实的基础，对落实社会治安综合治理也具有重要作用。去年，我们增编的人员绝大部分充实到了基层人民法院及其人民法庭，并且对一些不健全的人民法庭进行了调整和加强，还尽可能地为人民法庭工作人员创造工作和业务学习条件，以更好地发挥人民法庭的作用。但是，我们对加强基层特别是人民法庭的工作抓得还不够，他们的工作条件仍很艰苦。我们将进一步调查研究，在适当的时候召开人民法庭工作会议，切实加强人民法庭的工作，争取今年法院的基层工作有较大的变化。
    依照法律规定，人民法院应对人民调解委员会进行业务指导。现在有些地方的人民调解委员会的组织不健全，有些基层法院对调解委员会工作的业务指导有所放松，亟待整顿和加强。最高人民法院将会同有关部门，采取有效措施，健全人民调解委员会，加强民间调处群众纠纷的工作，以及时妥善地解决大量的民间纠纷，预防和减少违法犯罪。
    （七）开展与外国法院间的司法协助
    我国民事诉讼法规定，“根据中华人民共和国缔结或者参加的国际条约，或者按照互惠原则，人民法院和外国法院可以互相委托，代为一定的诉讼行为。”到目前为止，我国已经承认和参加的与审判工作有关的国际条约达５０多个，如《联合国国际货物买卖合同公约》、《保护工业产权巴黎公约》、《关于承认及执行外国仲裁裁决公约》等；同罗马尼亚、泰国、英国、荷兰等２０多个国家签订了投资保护协定；同法国、波兰、比利时签订了司法协助协定，还正在与一些国家商签司法协助协定。去年２月，最高人民法院向全国法院发出了《关于执行司法协助协定的通知》，要求地方各级法院认真执行已签订的司法协助协定。最高人民法院将继续积极参加司法协助协定的谈判，努力做好司法协助工作。这不仅是法院审判工作的需要，而且有助于促进中外经济贸易与科学技术合作以及文化交流的发展。
    各位代表，一年来，全国法院的审判工作取得了一定的成绩，法院自身的改革和建设也取得了明显的进展。这是在中国共产党的领导下，在人民代表大会及其常务委员会的监督和支持下，各级人民法院共同努力的结果。同时，最高人民法院在工作中还存在一些缺点，主要有：一是对全国法院工作面临的新情况、新问题调查研究不够深入、系统，对法院工作的宏观指导需要进一步加强；二是对下级法院审判工作的监督、检查不够，办案的质量和效率还需要进一步提高；三是对法院干部队伍的政治思想教育抓得不够有力，对一些干警中存在的纪律松弛、作风拖拉的现象，亟需进一步加强管理和教育。我们将坚决采取有效措施，努力改正。
    过去一年里，最高人民法院多次向全国人大常委会汇报工作，主动地接受全国人大及其常委会的监督，并要求地方各级法院自觉地接受人大及其常委会的监督。各级人大及其常委会加强对法院的监督，使法院工作得到了极大的支持。人民法院今后面临的任务将更为繁重、艰巨，我们真诚地希望各级人大及其常委会继续加强对人民法院的监督和支持。我们将进一步努力做好审判工作，积极为治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序和全面深化改革服务，为建设社会主义物质文明和精神文明服务。
