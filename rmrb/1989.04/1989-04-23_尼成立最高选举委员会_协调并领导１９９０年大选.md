Nicaragua Establishes Supreme Electoral Council

    To Coordinate and Lead the 1990 General Elections

    Our reporter Guo Weicheng reports from Mexico City: The Nicaraguan parliament passed a resolution on the 17th to establish the Nicaraguan Supreme Electoral Council, which is responsible for coordinating and leading the general elections scheduled for February 25, 1990.

    According to reports from Mexico City newspapers: The Nicaraguan Supreme Electoral Council is composed of 5 members. Among them, 2 are government representatives, 2 are representatives from the domestic opposition, and 1 is a neutral representative. This council will independently be responsible for coordinating and leading the elections. Although the current electoral law stipulates that the government can appoint 3 representatives, the parliament, which is dominated by the ruling Sandinista Front, still agreed to include 1 neutral representative and have the neutral representative chair the electoral council. Although people believe that it is difficult to find a truly neutral faction in Nicaragua, the parliament has begun to debate the draft amendment to the electoral law proposed by President Ortega.

    According to another report, U.S. President Bush signed the law on the 18th to provide $50 million in "humanitarian aid" to the Nicaraguan anti-government forces. He stated that this move will force the Nicaraguan government to keep its promise of democratization and reflect the bipartisan consensus in the U.S. Congress on Central American policy. Bush also urged the Soviet Union to take practical actions to support the peace process in Central America. In Nicaragua, President Ortega condemned the U.S. government's action and called on the anti-government forces to "lay down their arms."

　　尼成立最高选举委员会    
    协调并领导１９９０年大选
    本报墨西哥城电  记者郭伟成报道：尼加拉瓜议会１７日下午通过决议，成立尼加拉瓜最高选举委员会，负责协调并领导预定１９９０年２月２５日举行的大选活动。
    据墨西哥城报纸报道：尼加拉瓜最高选举委员会由５人组成。其中政府代表２人，国内反对派代表２人，中立派代表１人。这个委员会将独立地负责协调与领导大选。尽管现行选举法规定，政府可以派出３名代表。但是，由执政的桑地诺阵线占绝大多数的议会还是同意吸收１名中立代表，并由中立代表主持选举委员会。尽管人们认为，在尼加拉瓜很难找到真正的中立派。同时，议会开始就奥尔特加总统提出的选举法修改草案进行辩论。
    另据报道，美国总统布什１８日正式签署了给予尼加拉瓜反政府武装５０００万美元“人道主义援助”的法案。并称，此举将迫使尼加拉瓜政府遵守实现国内民主化的诺言，表现了美国国会两党对中美洲政策的一致性。布什还敦促苏联以实际行动支持中美洲和平进程。在尼加拉瓜，奥尔特加总统谴责了美国政府的这一行动，并呼吁反政府武装“解甲归田”。
