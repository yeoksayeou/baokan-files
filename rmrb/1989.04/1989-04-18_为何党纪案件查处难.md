Recently, we investigated the handling of party discipline cases in some units and found that there are mainly "three difficulties" in handling party discipline cases: difficulty in investigation and evidence collection, difficulty in handling issues, and difficulty in reporting good news but not bad news. Specific manifestations are as follows:

First, emphasizing objectivity and delaying resolution. For example, some units claim that the case is complex and difficult to investigate; some units claim that there are differing opinions from various sides and it is difficult to study; some units claim that the party involved does not understand and it is difficult to handle, resulting in some cases being unresolved for a long time.

Second, investigation and evidence collection, as well as reporting results, are not thorough. Some units do not discuss the investigation process and specific facts, only writing conclusions such as "no such incident" or "after investigation, there are significant discrepancies with the facts"; some units avoid the main issues when answering questions, causing difficulties in the review process.

Third, there is no clear stance on issues that have been investigated. Some units, in their handling reports, only describe the specific circumstances of the problem without stating whether it is right or wrong, and do not make a qualitative judgment; they only discuss the consequences of the problem without specifying who is responsible and for what, adopting a non-committal attitude. Some units push cases that should be handled at their level down to lower levels, and simply pass on the reported materials without taking action.

The reasons for the "three difficulties" are as follows:

First, some party members and cadres, especially leading cadres, do not fully understand the importance of seriously handling disciplinary cases and have vague ideas. For example, when dealing with economic disciplinary issues, some people believe that minor economic problems are insignificant in the context of developing a commodity economy; some people are concerned that investigating economic issues will affect production and operations, etc.

Second, it is difficult to gather evidence for economic cases and issues of leaders' lack of integrity.

Third, discipline is not strictly enforced. Some units need to handle certain issues, but leaders are concerned about affecting "stability and unity," often turning major issues into minor ones and minor issues into nothing, being lenient and indulgent towards people and issues with problems. For collective disciplinary cases and issues, as long as individuals do not gain personal benefits, the responsibilities of relevant leaders and parties involved are not pursued. Some people, in order to accommodate various "relationships," plead for leniency as much as possible.

Fourth, fear of being reported by superiors and exposing embarrassing incidents that would tarnish the unit's reputation, therefore, not only are investigations not proactive, but even cases that have been investigated are delayed in handling.

To solve the problem of difficulty in handling party discipline cases, we believe:

First, we should correctly understand the relationship between handling disciplinary cases and reform and opening up. Various disciplinary behaviors tarnish the image of the Party and government in the eyes of the people, damage the reputation of reform and opening up, and directly harm the interests of the state and the people. Therefore, only by seriously handling various disciplinary cases and issues, strictly governing the Party, and strictly enforcing Party discipline, can we ensure the healthy development of reform and opening up.

Second, we should correctly understand the relationship between handling disciplinary cases and maintaining stability and unity. In fact, various disciplinary behaviors are an important factor in disrupting stability and unity. If a unit does not strictly enforce discipline and does not promptly and boldly handle disciplinary cases reported by the masses, that unit will frequently have problems and will find it difficult to maintain stability and unity.

Third, we should correctly understand the relationship between handling disciplinary cases and protecting the collective. Indulging and protecting the disciplinary behaviors of units and individuals is not true protection. Ignoring disciplinary issues will undoubtedly breed hidden dangers and eventually lead to serious consequences.

In fact, handling party discipline cases is not difficult. As long as party organizations and leading cadres at all levels adhere to principles, lead by example in observing laws and disciplines, do not protect their own, dare to expose ugliness, and actively create conditions for strictly enforcing party discipline, and as long as disciplinary inspection units and disciplinary inspection cadres at all levels uphold justice, handle cases seriously, the problem of difficulty in handling party discipline cases can be solved.

### 为何党纪案件查处难

　　为何党纪案件查处难
    北京市　纪庆英
    最近，我们调查了一些单位党纪案件查处情况，发现在党纪案件查处上主要有“三难”，即调查取证难、问题处理难、报喜容易报忧难。具体表现如下：
    一是强调客观，久拖不结。如有的单位提出案情复杂，不好调查；有的单位提出，几方面的意见不一致，不好研究；有的单位提出当事人思想不通，不好处理等，致使一些案件长期不能了结。
    二是调查取证、上报结果不够认真。有的单位不谈调查经过和具体事实，只写“查无此事”、“经查，与事实出入较大”等结论；有的回答问题避重就轻，给审理工作带来困难。
    三是对已查实的问题不旗帜鲜明地表态。有的单位在查处报告中，只讲问题的具体情节，不讲这样做该不该、对不对，不作性质认定；只讲问题的后果，不讲由谁负责、负什么责，采取不置可否的态度。有的单位把应该由本级查处的案件推给下面去办，对上报的材料一转了事。
    出现“三难”的原因：
    一是有的党员干部特别是领导干部，对严肃查处违纪案件的重要性认识不足，存在模糊观念。比如处理经济违纪问题时，有的人认为在发展商品经济条件下，出点经济问题无碍大局；有的人担心查经济问题会影响生产经营等。
    二是对经济案件和领导干部不廉洁问题取证困难。
    三是执行纪律不严。有些单位要处理一些问题，但领导同志由于担心影响“安定团结”，往往大事化小，小事化了，对有问题的人和事姑息迁就。对集体违纪的案件和问题，只要个人没捞好处，就不追究有关领导人和当事者的责任。有的为照顾各种“关系”四处说情，尽量从轻发落。
    四是怕被上级通报，揭出丑事给单位抹黑，因此不但调查不积极，就是查清的案件也迟迟不作处理。
    要解决党纪案件查处难的问题，我们认为：
    首先应正确认识查处违纪案件与改革开放的关系。各种违纪行为玷污党和政府在人民群众中的形象，败坏改革开放的声誉，直接损害国家和群众的利益。因此，只有认真查处各种违纪案件和问题，从严治党，严格党的纪律，才能保证改革开放的健康发展。
    其次，正确认识查处违纪案件与安定团结的关系。其实，各种违纪行为正是破坏安定团结的一个重要因素。哪个单位执行纪律不严，不及时大胆查处群众反映的违纪案件，哪个单位就屡有问题发生，就难以保证安定团结。
    再次，正确认识查处违纪案件与爱护集体的关系。对单位和个人的违纪行为迁就护短，绝不是爱护。对违纪问题放任不管，无疑将养痈遗患，终有一日酿成严重后果。
    其实，查处党纪案件也不难。只要各级党组织和领导干部坚持原则，带头遵纪守法，不护短，敢揭丑，积极为严格执行党纪创造条件，各级纪检单位和纪检干部秉公执纪，认真办案，查处党纪案件难的问题就能够得到解决。
