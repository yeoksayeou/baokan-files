A new type of "high-efficiency calcium fortifier" has passed inspection today, with all its indicators reaching advanced international levels.

Calcium is one of the most active elements in the human body, but currently, the Chinese population is severely deficient in calcium. Experts from various fields have long advocated for the adoption of both dietary supplements and medication to address this issue. The "high-efficiency calcium fortifier" developed by the Beijing Multi-element Pharmaceutical Research Institute after years of research has a primary component of natural calcium content exceeding 40%, which is easily absorbed by the human body. By consuming foods fortified with this enhancer, people can intake more calcium.
