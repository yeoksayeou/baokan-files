The riots that broke out in the capital of Madagascar on the 17th are still ongoing. More than 10 people have died and over a hundred have been injured in clashes with local security forces.

According to reports, the riots were triggered by the opposition party's dissatisfaction with the presidential election held on March 12. They organized mass rallies, strongly condemning the election fraud and demanding a re-election and the establishment of an interim transitional government. On April 19, university students and primary and secondary school teachers in the capital held demonstrations and rallies in support of the opposition party's demands. The demonstrators clashed violently with security forces, resulting in casualties on both sides.

The situation in the capital remains tense. Shops are closed, traffic is disrupted, and major intersections are guarded by police and gendarmes.

It is also reported that on the 21st, Madagascar's President Ratsiraka decided to dismiss six members of the Supreme Revolutionary Council, including two candidates from the presidential election and four leaders from various parties.

    马达加斯加首都发生骚乱
    新华社塔那那利佛４月２１日电  马达加斯加首都１７日发生的群众骚乱仍在持续，有１０多人在同当地保安部队的冲突中死亡，上百人受伤。
    据报道，这次骚乱的起因是由于马达加斯加的反对党对３月１２日举行的总统大选不满。他们组织了群众集会，强烈谴责这次总统选举的舞弊行为，并要求重新进行总统选举和成立临时过渡政府。４月１９日，首都大学生和中、小学教师举行示威游行和集会，支持反对党的要求。示威群众与保安部队发生激烈冲突，双方都有伤亡。
    目前首都局势依然紧张，商店关门，交通中断，城市各主要路口均由警察和宪兵把守。
    另据报道，马达加斯加总统拉齐拉卡２１日决定解除６名最高革命委员会成员的职务，其中２人是总统大选中的候选人，另外４人均为各党派负责人。
