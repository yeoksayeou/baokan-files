Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 7th.

Over 300 people from various sectors in the capital paid their respects to the body of Huang Wei, a member of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a member of the National Committee for the Study of Historical Documents of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and a member of the Huangpu Military Academy Alumni Association, at Beijing Hospital this afternoon.

Huang Wei passed away in Beijing on March 20, 1989, at the age of 85.

Li Xiannian, Deng Yingchao, Xu Xiangqian, Nie Rongzhen, and Qiao Shi sent wreaths. Hu Qili, Song Ping, Yan Mingfu, and Hab Comin attended the farewell ceremony this afternoon.

Huang Wei was born in Guixi County, Jiangxi Province. After graduating from the Jiangxi Provincial Fourth Normal School in 1923, he was dissatisfied with the actions of the Beiyang warlords and enrolled in the Whampoa Military Academy. In 1924, he graduated from the first class of the Whampoa Military Academy and served as a platoon leader, company commander, and regiment commander in the National Revolutionary Army, participating in the Eastern Expedition and Northern Expedition. During the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, he participated in famous battles such as the "August 13" Battle of Shanghai. After the victory of the War of Resistance, he served as the commander of the 31st Army of the Youth Army, deputy commander-in-chief of the Logistics Command, and commander of the 12th Army Group. In December 1948, Huang Wei was captured in the Huaihai Campaign. After a long period of study, he recognized the truth that "only socialism can save China" and expressed deep regret for being drawn into the civil war after the victory of the resistance war. He was willing to contribute his efforts to building a democratic, independent, prosperous, and strong new China in the latter half of his life. In March 1975, after being pardoned and released, Huang Wei served as a member of the National Committee for the Study of Historical Documents of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. From 1978 onwards, he served as a member of the Standing Committee of the Fifth and Sixth National Committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

Huang Wei supported the leadership of the Communist Party of China, loved the socialist motherland, actively participated in the activities of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and expressed his opinions and suggestions on major issues concerning national political life and public concern. Huang Wei was upright, had a strong personality, and lived a simple life. He cared deeply about the cause of national reunification, missed his relatives and friends in Taiwan, and hoped that the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait could reunite soon and work together to achieve national reunification and the rejuvenation of China. He did a lot of meaningful work for this purpose. Even on the eve of his death, he was still actively preparing to accept the invitation from the relevant parties in Taiwan to visit the island and meet with old friends he had not seen for a long time.

Today, those who went to Beijing Hospital to bid farewell to Huang Wei's body also included Fei Xiaotong, Wang Renzhong, Yang Jingren, Zhao Puchu, Qu Wu, Ma Wenrui, Qian Xuesen, Hu Sheng, Sun Xiaocun, Cheng Siyuan, Qian Zhengying, Hou Jingru, Chen Zaidao, members of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing, some committee members, members of the Huangpu Military Academy Alumni Association in Beijing, and responsible persons from the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee, as well as friends from his lifetime.
