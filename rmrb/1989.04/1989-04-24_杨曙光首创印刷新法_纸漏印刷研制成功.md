A groundbreaking cultural and technological achievement—paper perforation printing—has recently been successfully developed by Yang Shuguang, a deputy researcher at the Yichun Regional Folk Art Museum in Jiangxi Province.

Paper perforation printing falls under the category of stencil printing. However, it is simpler and more convenient compared to the most commonly used screen printing and various types of offset printing. It is also faster in plate-making and more cost-effective. Art workers can complete various types of printed materials on their own desks in just 20 to 40 minutes after finishing their designs, with costs amounting to only 1% to 2% of screen printing.

Moreover, paper perforation printing offers rich and varied effects. It can print images on complex shapes and irregular surfaces, which other stencil printing technologies struggle to achieve. Therefore, its advent will significantly expand the application range of stencil printing.

Eleven prints created using paper perforation printing technology have been exhibited in Japan, France, Singapore, and Hong Kong, attracting the attention of the international art community.

    纸漏印刷研制成功
    本报讯  记者缪宜琴报道：一项国际首创的文化科技成果——纸漏印刷最近由江西省宜春地区群众艺术馆副研究员杨曙光研制成功。
    纸漏印刷属孔版印刷的范畴，但它较之目前孔版印刷中最常用的丝网印刷和各种油印印刷，简单方便，制版迅速，造价低廉。美术工作者在完成图样后，运用这一技术，在自己的办公桌上只要花２０到４０分钟，就可制成各种各样的印刷品，费用只及丝网印刷的１％到２％。
    不仅如此，纸漏印刷效果丰富多彩。在复杂形体、不规则表面也可印制画面，是其他孔版印刷技术难以做到的。因此，它的问世，将大大拓宽孔版印刷的应用范围。
    用纸漏印刷技术制成的版画，已有１１幅先后在日本、法国、新加坡、香港展出，受到国际美术界的关注。
