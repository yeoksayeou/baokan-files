Title: Severe Shortage of Coal Mine Production Personnel

Currently, most coal mines, especially local state-owned coal mines, are facing a severe shortage of production personnel, bringing them to the brink of halting operations. The reasons for this situation are as follows:

Firstly, in recent years, due to the reform of the labor system, coal mines have recruited almost entirely short-term contract workers and temporary workers, with local state-owned coal mines recruiting only temporary workers. Therefore, these workers are deeply dissatisfied with the arduous, dangerous, and seemingly hopeless coal mining jobs. The previous spirit of "making the mine one's home" has been replaced by today's short-term behavior. Coupled with low wages, most people are unwilling to work in coal mines.

Secondly, the significant increase in the prices of raw materials has directly affected the income of workers, dampening their enthusiasm for production. For example, the price of steel per ton has risen from 1,700 yuan last year to 3,600 yuan now; the price of enameled wire per kilogram has increased from 17.80 yuan to 42 yuan. The price increases of other raw materials are also above 30%. As a result, the cost per ton of coal has risen from the previous 17 yuan to around 30 yuan. Although all coal mines are focusing on "controlling costs and raising wages," micro-level adjustments cannot overcome macro-level losses of control.

Thirdly, the issue of temporary workers' grain procurement and consumption cannot be solved by the coal mines themselves, forcing workers to buy grain at high prices. Since their grain supply is not guaranteed, many people feel insecure and seek other jobs at the first opportunity.

To ensure the development of the coal industry, relevant higher authorities should take a long-term view on the issue of coal mine labor.

### 煤矿生产人员严重短缺

　　煤矿生产人员严重短缺
    当前，多数煤矿特别是地方国营煤矿，普遍存在着生产人员短缺，濒临停产的艰难局面。这种局面形成的原因是：
    一、近年来，由于用工制度的改革，煤矿招收的新工人几乎全部是短期合同工和临时工，地方国营煤矿招收的全部为临时工。因此，这些工人对所从事的又苦又累、危险性大、永无转正升级机会的挖煤职业深感不满，以前那种以矿为家的精神，被今天的短期行为取代了。加上工资待遇低，多数人都不愿在煤矿工作。
    二、原材料的大幅度涨价，直接影响到职工的收入，挫伤了工人的生产积极性。如每吨钢材由去年的１７００元涨到现在的３６００元；每公斤漆包线由去年的１７．８０元涨到４２元；其它原材料的涨价幅度均在３０％以上。这样，每吨煤的成本由往年的１７元上升到３０元左右。尽管各煤矿都在“控制成本，提高工资”，但微观上的调节不能克服宏观上的失控。
    三、临时工购粮、吃粮问题，煤矿本身无法解决，工人们只得买高价粮。由于他们吃粮无保障，许多人心里不踏实，一有机会，就另谋职业。
    为了煤炭事业的发展，有关上级部门在煤矿用工问题上应从长计议。
