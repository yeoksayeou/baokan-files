Our reporters Lü Fang, and China Geological News reporters Zeng Mianhua and Wang Xiwen report: It is estimated that after the year 2000, China's mineral resources will face a situation of overall tension. Experts have therefore called for an urgent reversal of the current severe resource wastage.

Our country's per capita resource ownership is not abundant, only half of the world average. Currently, we are the world's largest importer of steel and non-ferrous metals. By the year 2000, the production capacity of domestic iron, manganese, and chromium mines will decrease by 10%; the production capacity of copper, lead, and zinc mines will decrease by 40%. Currently, 60% of the state-allocated non-ferrous metal mines have entered the middle to late stages of their main metal production, and the development capacity of copper reserves can only meet 50% of domestic demand.

The problem is that we are not living "poorly" even though we are not in a "poor" situation. Mineral resource consumption is shocking. From 1953 to 1985, China's national income increased by 9.1 times, while energy consumption increased by 14 times, and the consumption of iron ore and non-ferrous metals increased by more than 23 times.

In our country, 80% of the ore deposits contain multiple useful components. One-quarter of copper ore, one-fifth of gold ore, and three-quarters of aluminum ore are found in associated ores. However, the results of a 1986 survey of 1,845 comprehensive mines nationwide showed that only 2% of the mines had a comprehensive utilization rate of more than 70%; three-quarters of the mines had a comprehensive utilization rate of less than 2.5%; the phenomenon of mining the main ore and discarding the associated ore, or even mining the associated ore and discarding the main ore, is widespread. The value of discarded associated minerals is often several times or even tens of times higher than that of the main ore.

The low recovery rate of ore mining and selection, and the lack of attention to the recycling of waste materials, are also heartbreaking. The coal recovery rate is only 40%, and small coal mines are less than 20%. Due to not meeting the national regulations for mining and selection recovery rates, Shanxi coal mines lose 4 billion tons of coal each year. Experts call for, in the face of this reality, we must implement a policy of strict resource conservation, comprehensive exploration, comprehensive surveying, comprehensive development, comprehensive utilization, and pay attention to the recycling of waste materials.

### 矿产资源并不丰  浪费程度却惊人

　　矿产资源并不丰  浪费程度却惊人
    本报讯  本报记者鹿舫，中国地质报记者曾绵华、王秀文报道：预计２０００年之后，中国矿产资源将出现全面紧张的局面。有关专家们由此呼吁，必须尽快扭转目前资源浪费严重的现象。
    我国人均资源拥有量本不丰足，只为世界平均水平的１／２，现在是世界上最大的钢材、有色金属进口国。而到２０００年，国内现有铁、锰、铬矿山生产能力将消失１０％；铜、铅、锌矿山现有生产能力将消失４０％。目前，全国６０％的有色金属统配矿山的主金属生产已到中晚期，铜探明资源的开发能力只能满足国内需要量的５０％。
    问题是“穷日子”未当“穷日子”过，矿产资源消耗惊人。１９５３年至１９８５年，我国国民收入增长９．１倍，能源消耗却增长１４倍，铁矿和有色金属消耗增长２３倍以上。
    我国８０％的矿床伴生多种有用成分，铜矿的１／４、金矿的１／５、铝矿的３／４在伴生共同矿中。然而，１９８６年抽查全国１８４５个综合性矿山的结果却是：综合利用率达７０％以上的只有２％；３／４的矿山综合利用率不到２．５％；采主弃副，甚至采副弃主的现象比比皆是，废弃的伴生矿物的价值往往高于主矿几倍乃至几十倍。
    矿藏采选回收率之低，不重视废旧物资回收造成浪费之大，也令人痛心疾首。煤矿回收率仅为４０％，小煤窑不到２０％。山西煤矿由于达不到国家规定的采选回收率，每年损失煤炭达４亿多吨。专家呼吁，面对这一现实，我们必须厉行节约资源的政策，综合找矿，综合勘查，综合开发，综合利用，注重废旧物资的回收。
