The China Writers Association and the Chinese Literature Fund today held a symposium on "Selected Poems of Ma Wanqi" at the Great Hall of the People. Poets and writers in attendance highly praised Ma Wanqi, who is currently a member of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress and the President of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Macau, for his decades-long journey with the Communist Party of China through thick and thin, sharing honor and disgrace, and his patriotic spirit of concern for the country and its people. Wang Zhen, Hab Zhumu, and Peng Chong attended to offer congratulations.

The "Selected Poems of Ma Wanqi," edited by the Chinese Literature Fund and published by the Writers Publishing House, includes 200 poems written by Ma Wanqi from 1937 to 1988 over more than half a century. The collection covers accounts of major historical events and expressions of admiration for the beautiful landscapes of the motherland. The style of the poems is simple and unadorned, yet powerful and majestic. Deng Xiaoping wrote the title for the poetry collection, and Xia Yan wrote the preface.
