A major case of forging national government documents to commit fraud has been busted by the public security authorities in Ankang. The perpetrator, Ye Jinlai, who had been defrauding people for one year and five months, swindling over 5 million yuan, has finally been apprehended.

In October 1987, Ye Jinlai, a farmer from Henghe Village, Qian Gong Township, Ankang City, forged documents supposedly issued by the State Council and central leaders. He then gathered a group of ex-convicts, individuals released from re-education through labor, and unemployed people to establish the "China International Overseas Chinese Trust Investment Northwest Group Xi'an Company" in Xi'an, with himself as the general manager. He repeatedly used the pretext of purchasing scarce commodities such as color televisions, aluminum ingots, silicon iron, gasoline, cocoon silk, and fertilizers to defraud over 20 enterprises in more than 10 provinces and cities, including Hainan, Zhejiang, Fujian, Sichuan, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen.

When Ye Jinlai returned to his home in Ankang from an out-of-town trip on the evening of April 8, he was immediately arrested by the public security authorities. Preliminary investigations have revealed that out of the over 5 million yuan Ye Jinlai defrauded, he squandered 730,000 yuan, spent nearly 100,000 yuan on bribes and so-called donations, and invested 100,000 yuan to build a luxurious mansion for himself.

The case is currently under investigation.
