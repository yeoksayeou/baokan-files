The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China announces with deep grief: The steadfast and tested communist warrior, great revolutionary and statesman of the proletariat, outstanding political worker of our army, and excellent leader who held important leadership positions in the party for a long time, Comrade Hu Yaobang, suffered a massive acute myocardial infarction during a meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee on April 8, 1989. Despite all efforts to save him, he passed away at 7:53 AM on April 15, 1989, at the age of 73.

Comrade Hu Yaobang's life was a brilliant one, and he left behind immortal achievements for the party and the people. In his youth, he joined the land revolution led by the Communist Party of China and participated in the famous Long March of 25,000 miles. From 1939 to 1945, he served as the director of the Organization Department of the General Political Department of the Central Military Commission. From 1946 to 1949, he served as the acting director of the Political Department of the Jin-Ji-Liao Military Region, the political commissar of the Third and Fourth Columns of the People's Liberation Army, and the director of the Political Department of the 18th Army Corps. After the founding of the nation, he held various positions including the secretary of the North Sichuan Party Committee and the director of the administrative office, the first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the first secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, and the second secretary of the Northwest Bureau. During the "Cultural Revolution," he fearlessly fought against the counter-revolutionary clique of Lin Biao and Jiang Qing. In 1978, he took on the role of the director of the Organization Department of the Central Committee, doing a great deal of work to rectify past wrongs, rehabilitate the wrongly accused, and implement policies for cadres, demonstrating extraordinary courage and resolve in seeking truth from facts, leaving behind indelible achievements. In the new historical period of socialist construction, he adhered to the line of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, making significant contributions to advancing modernization construction and reform and opening up.

Comrade Hu Yaobang was a member of the Eighth, Eleventh, Twelfth, and Thirteenth Central Committees of the Communist Party of China. He served as the deputy director of the Central Party School, the third secretary of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, and the secretary of the Central Committee and the director of the Propaganda Department. He was elected as a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee at the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee and as the chairman of the Central Committee at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. He was a member of the Political Bureau and the Standing Committee of the Twelfth Central Committee and served as the general secretary of the Central Committee from September 1982 to January 1987. He was a member of the Political Bureau of the Thirteenth Central Committee.

The passing of Comrade Hu Yaobang is a tremendous loss for our party and the people of our country. We must turn our grief into strength, learning from his spirit of loyalty to the party's cause, dedication, and struggle for communism; learning from his excellent style of closely connecting with the masses and serving the people wholeheartedly; learning from his noble qualities of humility, learning, considering the big picture, and simplicity. Under the leadership of the Central Committee of the party, we will continue to advance along the road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

The great revolutionary and statesman of the proletariat, Comrade Hu Yaobang, will be immortal!
