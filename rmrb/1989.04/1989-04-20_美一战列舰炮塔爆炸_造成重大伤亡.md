The U.S. battleship "Iowa" today morning experienced a powerful explosion in its turret during a drill in the Atlantic Ocean off the northeast coast of Puerto Rico, resulting in major casualties.

It is estimated that 47 sailors have died, with the number of injured unknown.

The explosion occurred in the battleship's second turret.

At the time of the incident, there were approximately 70 people in the turret, equipped with three cannons and a large amount of ammunition. After the incident, some of the wounded were airlifted by helicopter to an aircraft carrier 100 nautical miles away, while other medical personnel were dispatched from the aircraft carrier to the "Iowa" to assist the injured.

This 58,000-ton battleship was commissioned in 1943 and, after modifications, was re-commissioned in 1984. (Photo attached)
