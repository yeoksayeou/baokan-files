The morning of the 27th was bright and sunny, with a gentle sea breeze. Zhao Ziyang, the General Secretary, accompanied by Kim Il-sung, the General Secretary, boarded a white yacht from Songlim Port and sailed along the Taedong River, breaking waves straight to the West Sea Dam at the mouth of the Taedong River.

The table on the yacht was spread with a navigation map. Kim Il-sung frequently pointed to the markings on the map and introduced them to Zhao Ziyang. After the yacht passed Namp'o Port, the river opened up wide. Zhao Ziyang looked in the direction Kim Il-sung was pointing: a massive dam lay across the sparkling blue waters, stretching 8 kilometers wide. Three large ship locks and 35 water gates, along with auxiliary buildings, formed an impressive sight.

The West Sea Dam is a great achievement of the Korean people in building socialism and transforming nature. It is located between the villages of Ryongnam-ri in Namp'o City and Yŏngil County in South Hwanghae Province, spanning 8 kilometers across the blue waters. The three large ship locks on the dam can accommodate 2,000-ton, 20,000-ton, and 50,000-ton passenger and cargo ships. Additionally, the dam has railways, roads, and pedestrian paths. This grand project, costing $4 billion, was completed by 50,000 soldiers of the Korean People's Army after five years of hard work, moving mountains and filling seas, on June 24, 1986.

Zhao Ziyang and his entourage disembarked from the yacht and, amidst the cheers of the crowd, ascended to a small island connected to the dam. Looking around, they saw a large freshwater reservoir on the left, capable of holding 2.7 billion cubic meters of water; on the right, the vast blue sea; and in front, three large ship locks and a row of majestic, sturdy water gates. The dam management personnel demonstrated a performance on the high control tower of the ship locks, showing how the railway, road, and pedestrian bridge "made way" for large cargo ships to pass through the locks.

Next, the manager of the West Sea Dam, Byun Jong-gu, introduced the benefits of the dam in the guest hall on the small island. According to the introduction, the dam has four benefits. Firstly, it uses the stored water from the Taedong River to irrigate newly reclaimed tidal flats and farmlands along the West Sea coast and to prevent floods. Secondly, it solves the industrial and urban water supply problems for the industrial zone from Pyongyang to Namp'o along the lower reaches of the Taedong River. Thirdly, it enhances the transportation capacity of waterways, railways, and roads. Fourthly, it promotes aquaculture and beautifies the environment.

When Zhao Ziyang and Kim Il-sung drove across the dam in a car and stopped by a water canal, Zhao Ziyang and Kim Il-sung got out of the car and inquired in detail about the use of Taedong River water to irrigate farmlands and tidal flats. Byun Jong-gu, standing in front of a large irrigation map, introduced to Zhao Ziyang the irrigation situation of the first phase of the water canal and the prospects for the second phase of the project. Zhao Ziyang, looking at the water flowing endlessly into the fields, shook hands with Byun Jong-gu and said with satisfaction: "You have done a good job."

Zhao Ziyang wrote the words "Grand Project, Benefiting the People" for the West Sea Dam. Then he said to Kim Il-sung, the General Secretary: "The Korean people's great spirit and boundless wisdom have left a deep impression on us."

　　记赵紫阳参观西海水闸
    本报记者  徐宝康
    ２７日上午，阳光灿烂，海风习习。赵紫阳总书记在金日成总书记的陪同下，乘一艘白色游艇从松林港出发，沿着大同江乘风破浪直驶大同江入海口的西海水闸。
    游艇的桌子上铺着一张航行图。金日成不时地指点着图上的标志，向赵紫阳介绍。当游艇经南浦港后，江面豁然敞开。赵紫阳随着金日成指向的前方看去：只见一条巨龙般的大坝横卧在碧波粼粼的宽达８公里长的水面上。三座大型船闸与３５座泄水闸及附属建筑物连成一体，蔚为壮观。
    西海水闸是朝鲜人民建设社会主义，改造大自然的一大杰作。它位于大同江入海口南浦市岭南里和黄海南道殷栗郡之间的碧波上，全长８公里，大坝上３个大型船闸不仅可通过２０００吨、２万吨和５万吨的客货轮，而且大坝上还铺设了铁路、公路和人行路。这项耗资４０亿美元的雄伟工程，是朝鲜人民军５万官兵经过５年奋战，移山填海于１９８６年６月２４日建设起来的。
    赵紫阳一行走下游艇，在群众的欢呼声中，登上一座与大坝连接的皮岛，举目四望：左边是一座可蓄水２７亿立方米的大淡水库；右边是一望无际的蓝色大海；眼前是３座大型船闸和一排雄伟、敦实的泄水闸。水闸管理人员当场在高高的船闸控制塔上，为赵紫阳一行表演了一场铁路、公路、人行路桥为大型货轮“让路”通过船闸的“节目”。
    接着西海水闸经理边正国在皮岛客厅里向赵紫阳介绍了水闸建成后的良好效益。据介绍，水闸效益有４点。首先，用截储的大同江水，灌溉西海岸一带新开垦的大片海涂和农田并排洪防涝。其次，解决大同江下游平壤至南浦一带工业区的工业用水和城市用水问题。第三，提高水路、铁路、公路运输的能力。第四，发展水产养殖业，美化环境。
    当赵紫阳和金日成乘汽车从大坝上通过，行至一条水渠旁时汽车停下来。这是大坝左侧的一条与大同江相连的水渠，直通农田。
    赵紫阳和金日成走下车来，在水渠前详细地询问了用大同江水灌溉农田和海涂的情况。西海水闸经理边正国在一幅大型灌溉图前，向赵紫阳一一介绍了第一阶段水渠灌溉的情况以及今后进行第二期工程的前景。赵紫阳望着水渠中源源不断流向田野的水，握着边正国的手，满意地说：“你们搞得不错。”
    赵紫阳挥笔为西海水闸写下了“宏伟工程、造福人民”的题词。然后对金日成总书记说：“朝鲜人民的冲天干劲和无穷智慧，给我们留下了深刻的印象。”
