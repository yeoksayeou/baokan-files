Hitler's Last Hours

On April 30, 1945, the last day of his life, Adolf Hitler, the number one war criminal of World War II, spent his final moments. Forty years later, Traudl Junge, Hitler's former secretary, recounted these moments in her book "The Last Witness from the Bunker." Below is an excerpt based on the French magazine "Paris Match" introduction to the book's contents:

On the night of April 29, hurried footsteps in the hallway woke me up. I thought it might be time to have night tea with the Führer. When I entered his office, he extended his hand to me and said, "Did you rest a bit? I need to dictate some things to you." I saw eight glasses of champagne on the table. Goebbels and others arrived one by one. Hitler said to me, "Let's begin." We then went to the conference room. I sat in front of the typewriter, but Hitler said, "No, take shorthand," "This is my political testament..." My hands trembled for a moment because I was finally going to hear what we had been waiting for. What would he say? An explanation of the tragic events? A confession? An attempt to defend himself? No, none of these. He calmly and mechanically repeated what we had heard hundreds of times...

Then, Hitler dictated his "personal testament" to me: "During the war years, I was unable to enter into a marriage contract. Today, I decide, before my life ends, to marry this young woman. She voluntarily came to the besieged capital and will share my fate..." His gaze showed fatigue. At that moment, I realized he was going to marry Eva Braun before his death.

An official from the Berlin City Hall, who had been recalled from the front, officiated the wedding. When signing the marriage certificate, Eva first wrote a "B" (Braun), but immediately realized her mistake and corrected it to: "Eva Hitler."

On April 30, time seemed to pass slowly. We had lunch with Hitler and his new wife, Eva. Hitler talked non-stop. The topics were trivial, such as his beloved dog. Hitler liked to talk about his dog but avoided discussing the war. He knew: the end was near.

We discussed the methods of suicide. Hitler said, "The surest way is to put the gun in your mouth and pull the trigger, instant death." Eva disagreed. She said, "I want a complete body, I will die by poison." She took out a small copper bottle from her beautiful dress pocket, which contained cyanide. Hitler told her, "Taking cyanide will not cause pain."

After lunch, Hitler and Eva returned to their room. Soon, the adjutant Otto Günsche came to me and said, "Come with me, he is saying his farewell." I saw Hitler slowly walk out of the room, extending his hand to me. His hand was weak and limp. He looked at me, but I felt he didn't see me, as if I were a thousand miles away. He was muttering something...

Driven by an uncontrollable force, I rushed out of the room. In the hallway, I thought of Goebbels' children. They had been forgotten, and no one even thought to give them lunch. I found them and prepared some sandwiches for them.

Suddenly, a gunshot rang out, so close, echoing in the basement. Hitler was dead. I looked at my watch; the hands pointed to 15:30... Then, I heard the sound of boots in the hallway and smelled a strong odor of gasoline. Otto Günsche, pale-faced and trembling, sat beside me, muttering to himself, "I carried out the Führer's last order, burning his body."

For some reason, I went back to Hitler's empty room. Eva's small handgun was on the one-legged table, and the bottle containing cyanide was on the floor. On the blue and white sofa, there was a pool of blood—Hitler's blood...

　　希特勒的最后几小时
    一九四五年四月三十日，是第二次世界大战的头号战犯希特勒活在世上的最后一天。四十多年后的今天，希特勒当年的女秘书特劳德尔·荣克在她写的《地下室的最后见证人》一书中，记述了这个战争狂人度过的最后时刻。下面是根据法国《巴黎竞赛画报》对该书内容介绍的摘编：
    四月二十九日深夜，走廊里匆忙的脚步声把我惊醒。我想，也许是到了和元首喝夜茶的时候了。当我走进他的办公室时，他把手伸向我，说道：“你休息了一会儿吗？待会儿我要向你口述些事情。”我看到桌子上摆着八杯香槟酒。戈培尔等人相继而至。希特勒对我说：“我们开始吧。”于是，众人来到会议室。我坐在打字机前，但希特勒说：“不，用速记记录”，“这是我的政治遗嘱……。”我的手颤抖了一会儿，因为，我终于要听到我们所等待的事情了。他能让我记些什么呢？解释那些悲惨事件？忏悔？试图为自己辩解？不，都不是，他平静地、机器人似地重复了我们已经听过数百次的话……
    接着，希特勒又对我口述了他的“个人遗嘱”：“战争年代，我未能订立婚约，今天，我决定在我生命结束之前，娶这位年轻女子为妻。她自愿来到被围困的首都，和我一道听从命运的安排……”他的目光里流露出疲倦的神情。这时，我才知道，他要在死前娶布劳恩·爱娃为妻。
    柏林市府一位从前线召回的官员主持了婚礼。在婚约上签名时，爱娃先写了一个“Ｂ”字（Ｂｒａｕｎ布劳恩），但立即意识到自己错了，遂改写为：“爱娃·希特勒”。　　
    四月三十日那天，时间过得很慢。我们和希特勒及其新婚夫人爱娃一起共进午餐。希特勒喋喋不休地独白。话题都是些无关紧要的事情，比如他的爱犬，希特勒是喜欢谈论他的爱犬的，却避而不谈战争。他知道：大势已去。
    我们讨论过自杀的方式，希特勒说：“最有把握的方法是把手枪放进嘴里，按动板机，立时毙命。”爱娃不赞成。她说：“我要有个完好的尸体，我要服毒而死。”说着，她从那件漂亮的衣裙口袋中掏出一个小铜瓶，里面装着氰化物。希特勒告诉她：“吞服氰化物自杀不会有痛苦。”
    午饭后，希特勒和爱娃回到自己的房间。没多久，侍卫官奥托·贡舍过来对我说：“跟我来，他要告别了。”我看到希特勒缓慢地走出房间，向我伸出手来，那手软弱无力，他看着我，但我感到他并没看见我，好像距我有千里之遥，嘴里还自语着什么……
    我在一股无法控制的力量的驱使下，夺门而逃。在走廊里，我想起了戈培尔的孩子们，他们已被人忘记，甚至没人想到让他们吃午饭。我找到他们，为他们准备了几份三明治。
    突然，传来一声枪响，声音是那样的近，在地下室里回荡着。希特勒死了。我看了看表，时针正指向十五时三十分……接着，我听到走廊里响起靴子的声音，又闻到一股浓烈的汽油味。奥托·贡舍面色灰白，两手发抖，坐在我身边，自言自语地说：“我执行了元首的最后命令，焚烧了他的尸体。”
    不知为什么，我又来到希特勒的空房里，爱娃的小手枪放在独脚桌上，地上是那个装有氰化物的小瓶，蓝白色的沙发上印着一摊血迹，那是希特勒的血……
