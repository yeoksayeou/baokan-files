The cheers for every point scored were like the sudden eruption of volcanic lava, and even the sighs of regret for lost points were like the moaning of the sea waves—it was in this atmosphere, reminiscent of an ancient Roman gladiatorial arena, that two young athletes from West Germany ultimately won the men's doubles world championship, ending West Germany's history of being without a champion in the table tennis world. The president of the West German Table Tennis Association, Geip, was so excited that he shed tears.

Filling this gap for West Germany were 20-year-old Stefan Fetzner and 19-year-old Jörg Roßkopf. These two young players, who were still unknown in the last World Table Tennis Championships, advanced through the doubles event in this World Table Tennis Championships, surprisingly defeating the champions of the New Delhi World Table Tennis Championships, the Seoul Olympics, and the Asian Championships, Chen Longcan and Wei Qingguang, in the morning of yesterday, and entered the final round.

The final opponents were Poland's Kucharski and Yugoslavia's Kalinic. Both are European stars. Kalinic uses a left-handed penhold grip, is strong at the net, and once partnered with Shulbeck to win the 1983 Tokyo World Table Tennis Championships men's doubles title. Kucharski uses a right-handed shakehand grip, is strong at mid-distance, and partnered with Grubba to win the third place in the 1987 New Delhi World Table Tennis Championships men's doubles. In terms of technique and experience, they had the advantage. However, soon after the match began, people found that their coordination was slightly inferior to that of the West German players. Fetzner and Roßkopf, one tall and one short, moved their steps and changed positions in a timely manner, and their returns were accurate. Fetzner laid the groundwork, and Roßkopf "exploded," using tactics to create illusions for the opponents multiple times. The two tall opponents, who originally had large steps and fast movements, were tricked by this pair of West German players and stumbled several times.

Those familiar with them had more or less predicted their victory because, in terms of "teamwork," almost no one could match them. The two are of similar age, started playing around the same time, and both play in the "Borussia Düsseldorf" club. They are good friends in daily life and have long been partners in doubles, and people regard them as twins. However, their opponents lacked this condition. Grubba was good at "solo," and "duets" were not very harmonious. Kucharski happened to have difficulty cooperating with him, and he and Kalinic only started practicing together in this season. In fact, Fetzner and Roßkopf did not expect to win the Iran Cup, but they always remembered this principle: willpower creates results. This is the path to success for this pair of "twins."

　　姓名各异的“孪生兄弟”
    ——联邦德国第一个乒乓世界冠军速写
    对每次得分的欢呼都像一次火山熔岩的骤然喷发，连对失分惋惜的叹息也像一阵海涛的呜咽——就是在这样一种古罗马角斗场般的气氛里，联邦德国一对年轻的选手最终争得男子双打世界冠军，结束了联邦德国在乒坛上与冠军无缘的历史。联邦德国乒联主席盖普激动地流出了眼泪。
    为联邦德国填补这项空白的是２０岁的施泰凡·费茨奈尔和１９岁的约尔格·罗斯科普夫。这两个在上届世乒赛上还默默无闻的小将，在本届世乒赛的双打中，一路过关斩将，竟在昨天上午出人意料地击败新德里世乒赛、汉城奥运会和亚洲锦标赛三项冠军的陈龙灿和韦晴光，进入决赛圈。
    决赛对手是波兰的库哈尔斯基和南斯拉夫的卡列尼茨，两人同属欧洲名手。卡列尼茨左手直拍，长于近台，曾同舒尔贝克合作，拿过１９８３年东京世乒赛男子双打冠军。库哈尔斯基右手横拍，长于中台，与格鲁巴合作拿过１９８７年新德里世乒赛男子双打第３名。从技术、经验上说，优势在他们一方。可比赛开始不久，人们就发现他们在配合上略逊于联邦德国选手。费茨奈尔和罗斯科普夫一高一矮，步伐移动换位及时，接发球准确。费茨奈尔铺路，罗斯科普夫“爆破”，多次使用计谋给对方造成错觉。对方两个大个子本来步伐大，运动快，却被这一对联邦德国选手几次调得摔跟头。
    熟悉他们的人都多少预料到他们的获胜，因为在“人和”这一点上几乎无人可与匹敌。两人年龄相差不大，差不多同时起步打球，又同在杜塞尔多夫“勃鲁西亚俱乐部”打球，平日也是好朋友，早就配合参加双打，人们把他们当成一对双胞胎。而他们的对手就缺这个条件，格鲁巴擅“独唱”，“合唱”不太灵，库哈尔斯基偏偏难与他合作，他和卡列尼茨也是在这个赛季才开始合练。其实，费茨奈尔和罗斯科普夫并未预料到他们会获得伊朗杯，但他们始终记住这一信条：意志创造成绩。这正是这对“双胞胎”的成功之路。
