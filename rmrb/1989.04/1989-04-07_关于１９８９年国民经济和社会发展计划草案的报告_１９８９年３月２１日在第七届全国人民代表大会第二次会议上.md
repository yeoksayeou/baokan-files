Various representatives:

In his government work report, Premier Li Peng has given a comprehensive analysis and explanation of the economic situation over the past year and the guiding principles and major policy measures for this year's economic work. Now, at the request of the State Council, I will report on the implementation of the 1988 national economic and social development plan and the proposed arrangements for the 1989 plan, for your deliberation.

I. Implementation of the 1988 Plan

1988 was a year of continued progress in China's socialist modernization drive. Economic restructuring deepened, the national economy grew steadily, national economic strength was further enhanced, and various social undertakings made new progress. At the same time, economic life also faced many problems, the most prominent of which was the obvious inflation caused by economic overheating and excessive demand, leading to a sharp rise in prices.

First, social production continued to grow, but industrial development was too rapid. In 1988, the gross national product reached 1385.3 billion yuan, an 11.2% increase over the previous year at comparable prices; national income reached 1153.3 billion yuan, an 11.4% increase over the previous year at comparable prices. Agriculture suffered frequent natural disasters, and grain, cotton, and oil all saw varying degrees of reduction. Grain production was 394 million tons, a decrease of 880 million tons from the previous year; cotton production was 420 million tons, a decrease of 45,000 tons. Sugar production reversed two consecutive years of decline, with a significant increase. Meat, poultry, eggs, dairy, and aquatic products saw varying degrees of increase. The total agricultural output value increased by 3.2% over the previous year, failing to meet the planned 4% increase. The total industrial output value increased by 20.7% over the previous year, excluding village and below-village industries, which increased by 17.7%, far exceeding the planned 8% increase. Coal production reached 970 million tons, a 4.5% increase over the previous year; crude oil production reached 137 million tons, a 2.2% increase; electricity generation reached 543 billion kWh, a 9.2% increase; steel production reached 59.18 million tons, a 5.2% increase. The production of consumer goods, especially durable consumer goods, increased rapidly. Due to the excessive growth rate of processing industries, it exceeded the capacity of energy and raw material industries, making the structural contradictions within the industry more prominent. Railways, highways, and waterways transportation worked hard to tap potential, with cargo turnover increasing by 5.1%. Due to the sharp increase in passenger and cargo volume, the transportation situation became even more tense.

Second, a number of large and medium-sized fixed asset investment projects were completed and put into operation, but investment demand continued to expand, and the total scale of construction projects far exceeded the country's capacity. In 1988, 78 large and medium-sized basic construction projects were completed and put into operation nationwide, with 138 important individual projects within large and medium-sized projects. The completion and operation of a number of key power stations, coal mines, railways, ports, and scientific research projects increased the follow-up capacity for economic development. The newly added generating capacity was 999 million kW, the highest in the history of the country. Nearly 40,000 projects for the completion, renovation, and upgrading of existing facilities were completed nationwide, which will play an important role in increasing product varieties, improving product quality, and reducing consumption. Fixed asset investment, especially off-budget investment, continued to increase significantly. In 1988, the total fixed asset investment nationwide was 431.4 billion yuan, an 18.5% increase over the previous year; of which, state-owned units completed 269.5 billion yuan, a 17.3% increase, both far exceeding the growth rate of national income. The total scale of construction projects nationwide reached about 1300 billion yuan, obviously exceeding the country's capacity to bear.

Third, the retail sales of various commodities in the market increased across the board, but prices rose too sharply. The total retail sales of social commodities reached 744 billion yuan, excluding price factors, a 7.9% increase over the previous year. In the retail sales of consumer goods, food, clothing, and daily necessities all increased. Under the condition of excessive social demand, excessive currency issuance led to a 18.5% increase in the retail price index over the previous year. Affected by inflation, the market experienced several large-scale panic buying incidents, the shortage of commodities expanded, and the order in the circulation sector was quite chaotic.

Fourth, the monetary income of urban and rural residents continued to increase, but the actual living standards of some residents declined. In 1988, the average per capita disposable income of urban residents was 1119 yuan, a 22.2% increase over the previous year; the average per capita net income of rural residents was 545 yuan, a 17.7% increase, both far exceeding the growth rate of national income. After excluding the factor of price changes in urban and rural areas, the actual increase in the average income of urban residents was 1.2%, and the actual increase in the average income of rural residents was 6.3%. Under the condition of excessive price increases, due to the different increases in income and the number of dependents in the family, a considerable number of urban residents saw a decline in their actual living standards. Urban and rural residents' savings decreased in August but gradually recovered after measures were taken. The living conditions of urban and rural residents improved further, with 1.9 billion square meters of new urban housing and 8.8 billion square meters of new rural housing built. Social welfare and insurance undertakings continued to develop.

Fifth, there were new developments in foreign economic and technological exchanges, but the order of foreign trade needs further improvement. Due to the implementation of the coastal development strategy and the active development of export-oriented economy, China's foreign trade made significant progress in 1988. According to customs statistics, the total import and export volume reached 102.8 billion US dollars, a 24.4% increase over the previous year. Of which, the total export volume was 47.5 billion US dollars, a 20.6% increase; the total import volume was 55.3 billion US dollars, a 27.9% increase. After deducting goods such as processing with supplied materials and imported goods as investment that do not involve foreign exchange settlement and payment, the trade deficit was 3.1 billion US dollars. The structure of imported and exported commodities continued to improve. In the export commodities, the proportion of industrial manufactured goods further increased; in the import commodities, production materials accounted for more than 80%, and the import of high-end consumer goods was properly controlled. The actual utilization of foreign capital reached 9.8 billion US dollars, a 16.4% increase over the previous year; of which, the absorption of foreign direct investment was 2.6 billion US dollars, a 13.1% increase. Foreign economic and technological cooperation and international tourism also developed rapidly. However, there are still problems in foreign trade work, such as untimely delivery and product quality not meeting requirements. There are also chaotic phenomena such as multiple entities engaging in foreign trade. These need to be seriously improved.

Sixth, various undertakings such as science, education, culture, health, and sports have developed further, but they still cannot meet the needs of socialist modernization. In 1988, the development of science and technology was relatively fast. A total of 217 invention awards and 513 scientific and technological progress awards were approved by the state. Significant progress was made in key national scientific and technological research projects. The successful collision of the Beijing electron-positron collider, the successful underwater launch of a nuclear submarine missile, and the accurate positioning of a practical communication satellite over the equator marked new breakthroughs in China's high-tech field. At the same time, basic research and applied research were further strengthened. The implementation of the "Spark Program" yielded a number of new achievements. Basic education continued to be strengthened, vocational and technical education at the secondary level developed rapidly, and the structure of secondary education continued to become more rational. Higher education has initially formed a parallel development pattern of regular higher education and adult higher education. Literature, art, radio, film, television, news, and publishing, and other cultural undertakings all made new developments. The health and medical conditions of the people improved. Sports undertakings achieved new results, and mass sports activities became more active. In general, the development of these undertakings still does not meet the requirements of strengthening socialist material and spiritual civilization construction, especially the insufficient funds for science and technology and education, and the effectiveness of using these funds also needs to be further improved.

The above situation shows that in 1988, various aspects of China's national economy and social development achieved new results. At the same time, economic overheating, excessive demand, and inflation gradually worsened, seriously affecting the deepening of reform and the stability of the economy, and affecting the stability and improvement of the lives of urban and rural residents. The emergence of these problems is due to both objective reasons and our work shortcomings and mistakes, which have been explained in Premier Li Peng's government work report. The Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, held in September last year, correctly analyzed the economic situation and proposed the guiding principles of rectifying the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and deepening the reform comprehensively. It also decided to focus on rectifying the economic environment and rectifying the economic order for the next two years. In the past few months, through the joint efforts of various regions and departments, some initial results have been achieved. The work of cleaning up construction projects and compressing the scale of investment is being fully carried out. By the end of February this year, 18,000 projects have been suspended or slowed down nationwide, which can compress the investment of the next few years by more than 64 billion yuan; the situation of excessive growth in social collective consumption has been initially controlled, especially the retail sales of controlled commodities have significantly decreased; the excessively high industrial growth rate has begun to decline, with the cumulative industrial total output value for January and February this year increasing by 8% over the same period last year, far lower than the 18% increase in the same period last year; the upward trend of market prices has been weakened, and the public's anxiety about price increases has been somewhat alleviated; the order in the circulation sector has improved. The practice of the past few months has proven that the guiding principles and policy measures determined by the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee are in line with reality and correct, and have already had a positive impact on stabilizing the economy. At the same time, it must be recognized that the work of rectifying the economic environment and rectifying the economic order has just begun, and the tasks this year will be more arduous and more difficult. We need to have sufficient estimates and full mental preparation. We must not retreat or give up halfway when encountering difficulties, nor should we act rashly or simply. Only by firmly implementing the principles and various policy measures of the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, and by taking corresponding countermeasures and measures in a timely manner according to the new problems that arise in economic life, can we gradually get rid of the shackles of inflation and create a new situation through two or more years of persistent efforts.

II. Main Targets and Tasks of the 1989 Plan

Premier Li Peng clearly proposed in the government work report the six targets to be achieved through rectification and rectification. According to these requirements and the current situation, the main targets and basic tasks of the 1989 national economic and social development plan are to gradually eliminate economic overheating, ensure that the price increase rate is significantly lower than that of 1988, and strive to achieve a good harvest in agriculture. To this end, we must first focus on compressing the current excessive total social demand, resolutely compressing the scale of fixed asset investment, especially off-budget investment, to make it gradually adapt to the country's capacity to bear; strictly control the rapid growth of consumption demand, making it adapt to the growth of national income. While compressing demand, we must strive to increase effective supply, especially the production of major agricultural products such as grain, cotton, and oil, and from both production and conservation, strive to gradually alleviate the current tense situation of energy, raw material supply, and transportation. Compressing demand and increasing supply must be combined with adjusting the economic structure, so that limited resources are truly optimized and significantly increase efficiency.

According to the above guiding ideology, the macro-control targets of the 1989 plan are:

- Under the premise of improving economic efficiency, maintain an appropriate economic growth rate. Agricultural production increases by 4% over the previous year, industrial production increases by 8%; the gross national product increases by 7.5%.

- The total scale of fixed asset investment in the whole society is compressed by more than 20% compared to the previous year, and the investment structure is further improved according to the national industrial policy.

- The state budget deficit and currency issuance are both lower than the previous year.

- By effectively controlling demand and increasing and improving effective supply, the national retail price index is significantly lower than the previous year.

The specific tasks of the 1989 plan mainly include the following aspects.

(1) Resolutely compress the scale of fixed asset investment and adjust the investment structure. The 1989 plan arranges for the total scale of fixed asset investment in the whole society to be 330 billion yuan, a compression of 92 billion yuan compared to the estimated completion of 422 billion yuan in the previous year. Of which, the fixed asset investment of state-owned units is 210 billion yuan, a compression of 51 billion yuan. In the investment of state-owned units, basic construction is 120 billion yuan, and renovation and upgrading is 56.9 billion yuan.

Compressing the scale of fixed asset investment plays a decisive role in compressing total social demand and is a relatively quick way to see results. After a period of work, although some progress has been made in cleaning up construction projects and compressing the scale of investment, there is still a large gap compared to the requirements of this year's plan, especially since many regions and departments have a wait-and-see attitude, emphasize their own special circumstances, and compare with each other, many projects that should be suspended or slowed down have not been stopped, and many projects that have been stopped have the danger of "dead ashes rekindled." Therefore, to achieve the requirements of compressing the scale of investment and adjusting the investment structure this year, we must make a firm decision and take tough measures. First, resolutely grasp the work of cleaning up construction projects to the end. Not only should non-productive construction projects such as buildings, halls, and theaters, as well as unnecessary duplicate construction projects, be firmly compressed, but also some projects that should be carried out, including energy, transportation, and raw material industry projects, should be reasonably arranged according to financial and material capabilities, and some should be suspended or slowed down. For already signed contracts for utilizing foreign capital projects, except for a few that have been agreed to be canceled or postponed after negotiations between both parties, contracts must be strictly fulfilled. Construction projects of urban and rural collectives and individuals should also be carefully cleaned up and compressed. Only by resolutely stopping a batch of projects can the scale of investment be truly compressed. For suspended or slowed down projects, we must do a good job of follow-up work. Second, strictly control new construction projects. Except for a few agricultural, forestry, water conservancy, fertilizer, and education projects that must be started according to regulations, all other projects must not be started before the end of July this year. Whether to start construction after August will be decided based on the situation of compressing the scale of investment and the economic situation at that time. Third, reasonably arrange investment according to industrial policy and adjust the investment structure. On the basis of resolutely compressing the investment in non-productive construction and general processing industry construction, appropriately increase investment in agriculture, transportation, coal, and education. Fourth, implement directive planning management for bank investment loans, and strictly control the expansion of construction scale through social fundraising. No investment loans will be issued for general township enterprises, individual economies, and state-planned projects this year.

(2) Control the rapid growth of consumption demand and gradually ease the contradictions of social distribution inequality. To control inflation, not only must the scale of investment be compressed, but also the rapid growth of consumption demand must be strictly controlled, and the long-term situation of consumption growth exceeding production growth must be resolutely reversed. Premier Li Peng proposed in the government work report that during the rectification and rectification period, the government and the people must be prepared to have a few years of tight living conditions. This is completely correct and very important. In recent years, extravagance and waste have been quite common and serious. Many government agencies, organizations, and enterprises and institutions use public funds to entertain and give gifts, and in many activities, they pursue grandeur and show off wealth; many facilities blindly pursue modernization, and standards are getting higher and higher. All of these not only seriously deviate from China's current stage of economic development, but also damage our fine traditions and foster bad social customs. We must resolutely correct this situation, stop these bad practices, and vigorously promote and implement the principles of hard work, frugality in building the country, and frugality in all undertakings, oppose and overcome various extravagant and wasteful phenomena, and strictly control the rapid growth of consumption demand. Only by resolutely having a few years of tight living conditions can the excessive total social demand be truly compressed, and inflation can be effectively curbed.

In terms of how to control the rapid growth of consumption demand, we still lack experience, and effective measures are not many, and we need to rely on the joint efforts of a large number of cadres and the masses to actively explore in practice. From the current situation, we should first take strict measures to continue to compress collective consumption. The plan requires that the social collective consumption this year not only should not increase but also should be compressed by 20% compared to the previous year. Second, strengthen the management of wage funds. We must improve and perfect the method of linking the total wage of enterprise employees with economic benefits, so that the growth of employees' wages is truly based on the development of production and the improvement of labor productivity; through the rectification and strengthening of the management and supervision of enterprise's own funds, resolutely stop the issuance of various allowances and materials; rectify and improve the wage and bonus issuance methods of various companies, establish and improve a reasonable wage system and financial system; strictly implement the state's regulations, levy bonus tax and wage adjustment tax. The total wage of employees this year will continue to increase, but the growth rate should be controlled within the range that the country can bear, so as to facilitate the implementation of the requirement to control the price increase rate. Third, quickly establish and improve the personal taxable income declaration system, and further strengthen the collection of personal income adjustment tax, so as to gradually ease the contradiction of income disparity. Fourth, through compressing the scale of investment, rectifying companies, closing, merging, and transforming enterprises, and optimizing labor combinations, we should withdraw and compress the construction teams, temporary workers, and non-planned workers who have entered the city from rural areas in recent years, and strictly control the recruitment of workers from society to make up for natural attrition. Fifth, take measures such as increasing urban and rural residents' savings and promoting the commercialization of housing to reasonably guide the diversion of purchasing power, absorb and postpone part of the current consumption demand, so as to stabilize the market.

(3) Strive for a significant increase in agricultural production, especially grain, cotton, and oil production. Practice has repeatedly proven that agricultural production plays a great role in promoting or restricting the development of the entire national economy. Striving to achieve a significant increase in agricultural production, especially grain, cotton, and oil production this year, is the basis for increasing effective supply, stabilizing the economy, and curbing inflation. The 1989 plan arranges for grain production to be 410 million tons, an increase of 16 million tons over the previous year; cotton production to be 450 million tons, an increase of 30 million tons; oilseed production to be 160 million tons, an increase of 28 million tons; sugar production to be 65 million tons, an increase of 26.3 million tons. We should continue to encourage pig production, with a total meat production of 23.4 million tons, an increase of 2 million tons.

To achieve the agricultural production target this year and increase the effective supply of agricultural and sideline products, we must seriously implement the spirit of the National Rural Work Conference held by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council in November last year, and take some effective measures in the planning arrangement while continuing to deepen rural reform: First, appropriately increase the planting area of grain and cotton, compress the planting area of flue-cured tobacco, and prohibit the destruction of fields to build fish ponds and the use of arable land for fruit production. Second, increase agricultural development funds. This year, under the condition of financial and monetary tightening, the central government's investment in agriculture is planned to increase by more than 10% over the previous year; local governments should also allocate more funds for agriculture. Agricultural bank loans and credit union loans will also increase significantly. Starting this year, funds will also be raised through various channels to establish an agricultural development fund. At the same time, we must especially encourage farmers to increase their investment in agriculture. Third, build agricultural product commodity production bases. We should combine the transformation of low-yield fields with the construction of commodity bases, appropriately concentrate the use of various agricultural investments, and continue to build a number of national-level grain, cotton, and sugar commodity bases. Fourth, strengthen the economic development of poor areas, manage and use poverty alleviation funds from various channels well, arrange and concentrate the use, and strive to improve economic benefits. Fifth, continue to promote agricultural science and technology. This year, we should expand the area of hybrid rice by 10 million mu, hybrid corn by 20 million mu, and increase the area of film covering by 16 million mu. We should vigorously promote scientific fertilization technology and increase the area of formula fertilization. Sixth, increase the supply of agricultural production materials. The 1989 plan arranges for fertilizer production to be 85 million tons and pesticide production to be 20 million tons, and the supply will increase compared to the previous year. We should encourage farmers to grow more green manure and apply more farmyard manure, and mobilize and organize farmers to do a good job in agricultural water conservancy construction.

At present, we should strengthen the management of summer crops in the later stage, while continuing to focus on drought relief work, pay attention to preventing the occurrence of diseases and pests due to the high temperature last winter and this spring, and strive to achieve a bumper harvest of summer grain.

(4) Reduce the excessively high industrial growth rate and seriously adjust the production structure. Reducing the excessively high industrial growth rate to the appropriate level stipulated in the plan is an urgent requirement for rectifying the economic environment and eliminating economic overheating, and it is also an inevitable result of economic adjustment. We should not regard the reasonable decline in this growth rate as an abnormal production decline. Increasing effective supply is key to adjusting the production structure, and we should ensure that what should be protected is protected and what should be compressed is compressed. The most core issue at present is to increase coal production. Only with coal can we generate more electricity and produce more scarce raw materials, especially scarce steel. Of course, solving the coal problem also requires solving the transportation problem. The State Council is organizing relevant departments and regions to take effective measures to stabilize and increase the production of local small and medium-sized coal mines, and to organize and improve the transportation of coal. Railway coal transportation should be implemented according to a unified plan and unified transportation, and strictly managed. On the basis of increasing the production of energy and raw materials, we should actively increase the production of daily necessities for people's lives, suitable light textile products and scarce products, as well as export-earning products. We should promote the shutdown or transformation of enterprises with poor product quality and performance, and those that consume a lot of energy and scarce raw materials. Especially for those household appliances, aluminum cans, small cotton spinning, small wool spinning, small cigarettes, small plastics, and small aluminum factories that do not have legitimate raw material sources, not only should they not be expanded, but also a batch of them should be shut down and transformed. The allocation of energy, scarce raw materials, transportation capacity, and bank loans should reflect the requirements of adjusting the production structure and the principle of supporting the strong and limiting the weak, and should give priority to the needs of backbone enterprises that undertake the state's key production tasks and enterprises with good economic benefits. All enterprises should focus on technological progress and management improvement, strive to save resources and comprehensively utilize them, reduce material consumption, improve labor productivity, improve product quality, reduce fund occupation, and increase economic benefits. We should carry out the movement of increasing production and saving, and increasing income and saving expenses in a deep and sustained manner, and achieve real results.

Since the beginning of this year, the growth rate of state-owned industry has decreased significantly, while the excessively high growth rate of collective-owned industry, especially township industry, has not been effectively controlled. Township industry and village-run industry should adjust the product structure, improve the business style, focus on improving economic benefits, treat environmental pollution, and reduce the growth rate to a reasonable level.

(5) Properly adjust the import and export commodity structure and further expand foreign economic cooperation and technological exchanges. Rectifying the economic environment and rectifying the economic order are mutually promoting with adhering to opening up to the outside world. Adhering to the policy of opening up to the outside world and making full use of the favorable conditions of opening up, actively developing foreign trade and export-oriented economy can adjust domestic supply and demand, increase effective supply, expand exports and earn foreign exchange, which is conducive to curbing inflation and reducing the difficulties in rectification and rectification. On the other hand, doing a good job in rectification and rectification can create a favorable environment for opening up and developing an export-oriented economy. This year, we will further develop foreign economic cooperation and technological exchanges and continue to implement the coastal development strategy.

We should, on the basis of reasonably adjusting the import and export commodity structure, strive to expand foreign trade and increase foreign exchange earnings. We should comprehensively consider the needs of domestic and foreign sales, gradually reduce the export proportion of resource-based products and semi-finished products, increase the export of industrial manufactured goods such as machinery and electrical products, and vigorously develop processing with supplied materials and processing with imported materials. In the import arrangement, we should give priority to the import of important commodities related to the national economy and people's livelihood, strictly control the import of some high-end consumer goods and repeated introduction of technology and equipment; for commodities that can be produced and supplied domestically, we should control or prohibit imports.

Coastal regions should, in the process of rectification and rectification, make use of the current relatively favorable opportunity, give full play to their advantages, proceed from reality, adjust the economic structure, and actively develop export-oriented economy with both ends in foreign countries. We should continue to introduce foreign capital, advanced technology, and management experience, use China's existing enterprises for transformation, establish Sino-foreign joint ventures and cooperative enterprises, and continue to encourage foreign investors to establish wholly-owned enterprises in China.

(6) Further develop science, technology, education, culture, health, and sports. This year, we will continue to implement the deployment of the "Seventh Five-Year Plan," concentrate necessary manpower, financial resources, and material resources, and focus on the scientific and technological research and development of 20 sets of technologies, 100 key processes, and 400 important products, and strive to achieve a number of results. We will continue to focus on the research and development of 11 major technological equipment such as the second phase of Baosteel, and improve the level of localization. We should carry out research and development of high technology in a step-by-step and focused manner. We should pay attention to and strengthen the research of basic science and basic theory. We should actively promote advanced and applicable scientific and technological achievements, focus on the implementation of 15 industrial trial projects identified by the state, and implement the state-level major new product trial production plan. We should continue to implement the "Spark Program" and gradually implement the "Torch Program" to promote the progress of social production technology and the transformation of scientific and technological achievements into commodities.

We should put education in an important strategic position and ensure its development during the rectification and rectification. This year, under the condition of nationwide compression of fiscal expenditure and construction investment, various levels of government have made great efforts to continue to increase education funds and education investment, and continue to improve the working and living conditions of teachers. We should continue to advocate and encourage various sectors of society to raise funds for education. Higher education should, under the guidance of adjusting the structure, enrolling according to needs, and improving quality, appropriately control the number of graduate students enrolled, and stabilize the number of students enrolled in ordinary colleges and universities. The 1989 plan arranges for 40,000 graduate students to be enrolled and 640,000 students to be enrolled in ordinary colleges and universities, roughly maintaining the level of the 1988 plan. Adult education should focus on strengthening the training of in-service employees. We should continue to develop vocational and technical education and closely combine universal education with the development of vocational and technical education. We should further develop primary and secondary education, seriously implement the Compulsory Education Law, and correct the phenomenon of students dropping out of school or quitting school in some places in time; at the same time, we should speed up the renovation of dilapidated primary and secondary schools. All levels and types of schools should reform and strengthen moral education and promote the all-round development of students' morality, intelligence, physique, and aesthetics.

Literature, art, radio, film, television, and news publishing, and other cultural undertakings should adhere to the direction of serving the people and socialism, adhere to the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, correctly handle the relationship between economic benefits and social benefits, provide the masses with rich and healthy spiritual nourishment, and play an active role in promoting the construction of socialist material and spiritual civilization.

The health sector should continue to implement the policy of prevention first, strengthen the construction of the health team, and provide high-quality services to society; the sports sector should, while strengthening the construction of the team, further carry out mass sports activities and promote the continuous improvement of the overall health level of the nation.

China has a large population base and is currently at the peak of fertility. Family planning work must be grasped and done well, and must not be relaxed. We should further strengthen propaganda and education, resolutely implement the current family planning policy, strictly control population growth, improve population quality, and promote economic development and social progress.

III. Deepening the Reform Comprehensively, Strengthening and Improving Macroeconomic Control, and Striving to Achieve the 1989 Plan

To combine the rectification of the economic environment and the rectification of the economic order with the comprehensive deepening of the reform is the most important guarantee for achieving the 1989 plan. Rectification and rectification and deepening the reform are unified and complementary. Rectification and rectification should be carried out on the premise of adhering to the direction of reform, and fundamentally speaking, only by relying on the deepening of reform can we achieve the desired results. On the other hand, only through rectification and rectification can we create a relatively good economic and social environment for deepening the reform in the macro sense, so all reforms should be carried out around rectification and rectification. This year, we should focus on improving and developing the various reform measures that are being implemented, and according to the requirements of rectification and rectification, carry out some new reform explorations. Regarding the main tasks of economic system reform this year, Premier Li Peng has given a comprehensive explanation in the government work report. Here, we will focus on the following three opinions.

First, further improve and develop the enterprise contract responsibility system. To digest the price increase factors, increase fiscal revenue, and ensure market supply, it ultimately depends on enterprises, especially large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, to improve economic benefits. Large and medium-sized enterprises play a crucial role in China's economic life, have relatively good technology and equipment and management experience, and have a large number of talents, and should and can make more contributions in improving economic benefits and increasing effective supply. This year, the supply of energy, transportation capacity, and main raw materials is relatively tight, and the supply of funds is also quite tight. Enterprises face many difficulties in production and operation, and we must rely on deepening the reform to fully mobilize the enthusiasm and initiative of the broad masses of workers to overcome these difficulties. The enterprise contract responsibility system should be improved and developed on the basis of summarizing experience, and the ability of enterprises to self-discipline and adapt to market changes should be enhanced. We should earnestly implement the "Enterprise Law," continue to promote the factory director responsibility system, strengthen enterprise management, and optimize the labor combination. At the same time, we should adapt to the requirements of economic adjustment, actively promote the merger and acquisition of enterprises, develop enterprise groups, and optimize the organizational structure of enterprises. On the basis of formulating the charter and regulations, we should steadily carry out the pilot work of the shareholding system with public ownership as the mainstay.

Second, vigorously rectify the economic order, especially the circulation order, and promote the construction of a new socialist commodity economy order. We should continue to do a good job in the cleanup and rectification of companies, reduce circulation links and intermediate exploitation, and especially seriously rectify various illegal operations. We should continue to cultivate various commodity and material trading markets, strengthen the organization and construction of the market, improve market operation rules, and establish a normal market order. For important production materials and consumer goods related to the national economy and people's livelihood, we should adopt different circulation methods and management methods according to different situations. We should strictly manage prices and resolutely prevent and correct disorderly price increases and disguised price increases. We should organize the supply of market commodities well, especially to do a good job in the procurement and allocation of important agricultural products such as grain, cotton, oil, sugar, and meat, and ensure the planting area of vegetables in large and medium-sized cities, increase supply, and stabilize prices. Large and medium-sized cities should list a number of essential commodity catalogs for people's lives, and ensure the market supply and basic stability of prices of these commodities.

Third, strengthen and improve macroeconomic control. To promote rectification and rectification and comprehensively deepen the reform, and to develop a planned commodity economy, we must put strengthening and improving macroeconomic control in a prominent position. According to the characteristics of economic operation during the transition from the old to the new system and the problems existing in economic life, the current strengthening and improvement of macroeconomic control need to focus on solving the following problems while strengthening comprehensive balance:

One is to strengthen the management and regulation of social funds by the central bank. The central bank and specialized banks are all state banks and must implement the state's policies and undertake the functions of macroeconomic control. We should strengthen the leadership and management of the central bank over specialized banks and other financial institutions, and strengthen the vertical leadership of the central bank system; local governments should actively help with bank business, but should not distribute loans outside the state credit plan. The prominent problem that needs to be solved to strengthen the bank's control ability at present is to increase the recovery of credit by all means and expand savings deposits. At present, the recovery of savings deposits of urban and rural residents is not fast, enterprise deposits are decreasing, and various social fundraising and cash settlement not through banks are increasing, which reduces the source of bank loan funds, makes it difficult to control the issuance of currency, and leads to the tight liquidity of many enterprises, especially large and medium-sized enterprises, and seriously weakens the bank's ability to control social funds. To change this situation, on the one hand, we should take various effective measures such as strengthening propaganda and education to increase the savings of urban and rural residents, so that the broad masses understand that increasing savings can support the state's rectification and rectification work and is also beneficial to reducing their own losses in the inflation situation, and actively participate in savings. On the other hand, we should strengthen the cash management of government agencies, organizations, and enterprises and institutions, strictly control various social fundraising activities, and at the same time, resolutely crack down on and eliminate illegal activities such as usury, and bring the scattered social funds into the bank's turnover channel as much as possible.

Two is to appropriately increase the proportion of fiscal revenue in national income. In recent years, the proportion of fiscal revenue in national income has been decreasing year by year, and now it has dropped to below 20%. At the same time, the proportion of central fiscal revenue in the total fiscal revenue is also too low, currently still below 50%. In such a large developing country as ours, this proportion cannot meet the needs of strengthening macroeconomic control, nor can it fundamentally reverse the difficult situation of the state finance, especially the central finance, in recent years. Whether from the current and long-term development needs, the proportion of state fiscal revenue in national income, and the proportion of central fiscal revenue in the total fiscal revenue should be appropriately increased. Starting from this year, we should gradually move in this direction.

While strengthening financial and monetary management, we should strengthen the unified management of foreign exchange and foreign debt, and take effective measures to correctly guide the use of retained foreign exchange by local governments, departments, and enterprises.

Three is to formulate and implement industrial policies suitable for China's actual situation. At present, China's economy has serious problems in industrial structure. Formulating the correct industrial policy is an important basis for adjusting the industrial structure and implementing macroeconomic control. The organization of formulating industrial policies is a very complex task, which requires the coordination and joint efforts of all parties to do well. At the same time, we should comprehensively use economic, administrative, and legal means to promote its implementation. Now, this work has just begun, and we should continuously improve and perfect it in practice.

Strengthening macroeconomic control ultimately depends on the central government being able to speak and act, and being able to enforce orders. Premier Li Peng emphasized in the government work report that it is necessary to maintain the unity of administrative orders and pointed out that without necessary concentration and unity, it is impossible to adjust the economy and overcome difficulties.

To do this, the key is to correctly handle the relationship between local interests and overall interests, and adhere to the principle of local interests subordinating to overall interests. To control inflation and adjust the economic structure, it is inevitable to make some necessary adjustments to the existing interest pattern. This adjustment will inevitably require some local interests to make temporary sacrifices in exchange for the stability and development of the overall situation. If the vested interests of all places, departments, enterprises, and individuals cannot be touched, then economic adjustment will be in vain. Therefore, all levels of leading cadres should consider the overall situation, set an example, be honest and upright, and work hard; at the same time, we should strengthen ideological and political work, advocate democratic style, and honestly explain the current problems, the reasons for taking various measures, and the bright future to the masses, and respect and absorb all good opinions from the masses, and lead and mobilize the masses to overcome difficulties together.

Various representatives! Ten years of reform and construction have laid a relatively good material foundation for us. The current international environment is also favorable to us. Although we face many difficulties and problems, the difficulty of rectification, rectification, and adjustment is considerable, but as long as we rely on and unite the people of all ethnic groups in the country, resolutely implement the principles of rectification and rectification and deepening the reform, we will definitely be able to fully achieve the 1989 plan, and definitely be able to gradually overcome the temporary difficulties in the process of advancement, and make the cause of socialist modernization steadily and healthily advance.

　　关于１９８９年国民经济和社会发展计划草案的报告
    ——１９８９年３月２１日在第七届全国人民代表大会第二次会议上
    国务院副总理兼国家计划委员会主任  姚依林各位代表：
    李鹏总理在政府工作报告中，对去年以来的经济形势和今年经济工作的指导方针与重大政策措施，已经作了全面的分析和阐述。现在，我受国务院委托，就１９８８年国民经济和社会发展计划执行情况和１９８９年计划安排意见，向大会作报告，请予审议。
    一、１９８８年计划的执行情况
    １９８８年是我国社会主义现代化建设事业继续向前发展的一年。经济体制改革继续深入，国民经济持续增长，国家经济实力进一步加强，各项社会事业有了新的发展。与此同时，经济生活中也存在不少问题，最突出的是，由于经济过热、需求过旺，出现了明显的通货膨胀，物价上涨幅度过大。
    第一，社会生产持续增长，但工业发展速度过高。１９８８年国民生产总值达到１３８５３亿元，按可比价格计算，比上年增长１１．２％；国民收入达到１１５３３亿元，按可比价格计算，比上年增长１１．４％。农业遭受了比较频繁的自然灾害，粮、棉、油都有不同程度减产。粮食产量３．９４亿吨，比上年减产８８０多万吨；棉花产量４２０万吨，减产４５０００吨。糖料扭转了连续两年减产的局面，产量有较大回升。肉、禽、蛋、奶、水产品等的产量多数都有不同程度的增长。农业总产值比上年增长３．２％，没有达到计划增长４％的要求。工业总产值比上年增长２０．７％，不包括村及村以下的工业则增长１７．７％，大大超过了计划增长８％的速度。原煤产量达到９．７亿吨，比上年增长４．５％；原油产量达到１．３７亿吨，增长２．２％；发电量达到５４３０亿千瓦小时，增长９．２％；钢产量达到５９１８万吨，增长５．２％。以非农产品为原料的消费品工业，特别是各种耐用消费品增长很快。由于加工工业的增长速度过高，超过了能源、原材料工业的承受能力，使工业内部的结构性矛盾更为突出。铁路、公路和水路运输努力挖掘潜力，货物周转量增长５．１％。由于客货运量急剧增长，交通运输的紧张状况进一步加剧。
    第二，一批大中型固定资产投资项目竣工投产，但投资需求继续膨胀，在建工程投资总规模大大超过国力的可能。１９８８年全国建成投产的大中型基本建设项目７８个，大中型项目中的重要单项工程１３８个。一批重点电站、煤矿、铁路、港口及科研项目的建成投产，为经济发展增加了后续能力。新增发电装机容量９９９万千瓦，是建国以来增加最多的一年。全国建成投产更新改造项目近４００００个，将在增加产品品种、提高产品质量和降低消耗等方面发挥重要作用。固定资产投资特别是预算外投资继续大量增加，１９８８年全国固定资产投资完成４３１４亿元，比上年增长１８．５％；其中全民所有制单位完成２６９５亿元，增长１７．３％，都大大超过国民收入的增长幅度。全国在建工程投资总规模达到１３０００亿元左右，明显超过了国力承担的可能。
    第三，市场各类商品零售额全面增长，但物价上涨过猛。社会商品零售总额达到７４４０亿元，扣除价格因素，比上年实际增长７．９％。在消费品零售额中，吃、穿、用商品普遍增长。在社会需求过度膨胀的情况下，货币发行过多，导致零售物价指数比上年上升１８．５％。受通货膨胀的影响，市场曾出现几次较大的抢购风，商品紧缺面扩大，流通领域秩序相当混乱。
    第四，城乡人民货币收入继续增加，而一部分居民实际生活水平有所下降。１９８８年城镇居民平均每人可用于生活费的收入为１１１９元，比上年增长２２．２％；农民平均每人纯收入为５４５元，增长１７．７％，都大大超过国民收入的增长幅度。扣除城乡价格变动的因素之后，城镇居民平均收入实际增长１．２％，农民平均收入实际增长６．３％。在物价上涨幅度过大的情况下，由于收入增加幅度和家庭赡养人口不同，有相当一部分城镇居民实际生活水平有所下降。城乡居民储蓄在８月份曾一度减少，经采取措施后逐步回升。城乡居住条件进一步改善，城镇新建住宅１．９亿平方米，农村新建住房８．８亿平方米。社会福利事业和保险事业继续发展。
    第五，对外经济技术交流取得新的进展，但对外贸易的秩序有待于进一步改善。由于实施沿海地区经济发展战略，积极发展外向型经济，１９８８年我国对外贸易取得了较大进展。据海关统计，进出口货物总额达到１０２８亿美元，比上年增长２４．４％。其中，出口总额４７５亿美元，增长２０．６％；进口总额５５３亿美元，增长２７．９％。扣除不收付外汇的来料加工和外商作为投资进口等货物后，进出口逆差为３１亿美元。进出口商品结构继续有所改善。在出口商品中，工业制成品所占比重进一步提高；在进口商品中，生产资料占８０％以上，高档消费品的进口得到了适当控制。全年实际利用外资达９８亿美元，比上年增长１６．４％；其中吸收外商直接投资２６亿美元，增长１３．１％。对外经济技术合作和国际旅游业也都有较快发展。目前在外贸工作中还存在着交货不及时、产品质量不合要求等缺点，存在着多头对外等混乱现象。这些都需要认真加以改进。
    第六，科学、教育、文化、卫生、体育等各项事业进一步发展，但还不能适应社会主义现代化建设的需要。１９８８年科技事业发展较快。经国家批准的发明奖２１７项，科学技术进步奖５１３项。国家重点科技攻关项目取得显著成效。北京正负电子对撞机对撞成功，核潜艇水下发射火箭成功，实用通讯卫星准确定点赤道上空等，标志着我国高科技领域有了新的突破。与此同时，基础研究和应用研究得到进一步加强。推行“星火计划”获得了一批新的成果。基础教育继续得到加强，中等职业技术教育发展迅速，中等教育结构继续趋于合理。高等教育已初步形成普通高等教育和成人高等教育平行发展的格局。文学、艺术、广播、电影、电视、新闻、出版等各种文化事业都有新的发展。人民群众的卫生医疗条件有所改善。体育事业取得了新的成就，群众体育活动更加活跃。总的来说，以上各项事业的发展，与加强社会主义物质文明和精神文明建设的要求还不相适应，特别是科技和教育的经费不足，这些经费的使用效果也有待于进一步提高。
    上述情况说明，１９８８年我国国民经济和社会发展各个方面都取得了新的成绩，与此同时，经济过热、需求过旺、通货膨胀逐步加剧，严重影响改革的深化和经济的稳定，影响城乡人民生活的安定和改善。出现这些问题，既有客观的原因，也有我们工作上的缺点、失误，这在李鹏总理的政府工作报告中已经作了说明。去年９月召开的中国共产党十三届三中全会，正确地分析了经济形势，提出了治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革的指导方针，并且确定把今明两年建设和改革的重点突出地放到治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序上来。几个月来，经过各地区、各部门的共同努力，已经初步取得一些成效。清理在建项目、压缩投资规模的工作正在全面展开，到今年２月底，全国已停缓建项目１８０００个，可以压缩今后几年的投资６４０多亿元；社会集团消费增长过快的状况初步得到控制，特别是专控商品的零售额明显下降；过高的工业增长速度开始回落，今年１至２月份累计工业总产值比去年同期增长８％，大大低于去年同期增长１８％的幅度；市场物价上涨势头有所减弱，群众对涨价的紧张心理有所缓和；流通领域的秩序有所改进。几个月来的实践证明，十三届三中全会确定的指导方针和政策措施是符合实际的、正确的，已经对稳定经济产生了积极作用。同时，也必须看到，治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序的工作才刚刚开始，今年的任务将更加繁重、更加艰巨，对此我们需要有足够的估计和充分的思想准备。既不能遇难而退、半途而废，也不能操之过急、简单从事。只有坚定不移地贯彻执行十三届三中全会的方针和各项政策措施，并且根据经济生活中发生的新问题，及时采取相应的对策和办法，经过两年或者更长一点时间坚韧不拔的努力，我国的经济才有可能逐步摆脱通货膨胀的困扰，出现一个新的局面。
    二、１９８９年计划的主要目标和任务
    李鹏总理在政府工作报告中明确提出了治理、整顿所要达到的六项目标。按照这些要求和当前的实际情况，１９８９年国民经济和社会发展计划的主要目标和基本任务是，逐步消除经济过热，确保物价上涨幅度明显低于１９８８年，力争农业有一个好收成。为此，首先要着重把当前过大的社会总需求压缩下来，下大决心进一步压缩固定资产投资规模，特别是预算外投资规模，使之逐步同国力承担的可能相适应；严格控制消费需求的过快增长，使之同国民收入的增长相适应。在紧缩需求的同时，要努力增加有效供给，特别是增加粮、棉、油等主要农产品的生产，并且从增产与节约两个方面入手，努力使目前存在的能源、原材料供应和交通运输的紧张状况逐步有所缓和。压缩需求、增加供给，必须同调整经济结构结合起来，使有限的资源真正择优配置，明显增进效益。
    按照上述指导思想，１９８９年计划的宏观调控目标是：
    ——在提高经济效益的前提下，保持适度的经济增长率。农业生产比上年增长４％，工业生产增长８％；国民生产总值增长７．５％。
    ——全社会固定资产投资总规模，比上年水平压缩２０％以上，并按照国家产业政策，进一步改善投资结构。
    ——国家预算赤字和货币发行量都要低于上年。
    ——通过切实控制需求，增加和改善有效供给，做到全国零售物价指数上涨幅度明显低于上年。
    １９８９年计划的具体任务，主要有以下几个方面。
    （一）坚决压缩固定资产投资规模，调整投资结构。１９８９年计划安排，全社会固定资产投资规模３３００亿元，比上年预计完成的４２２０亿元压缩９２０亿元。其中，全民所有制单位固定资产投资２１００亿元，压缩５１０亿元。在全民所有制单位投资中，基本建设为１２００亿元，更新改造为５６９亿元。
    压缩固定资产投资规模，对压缩社会总需求具有决定性作用，也是见效比较快的办法。经过前一段的工作，清理在建项目、压缩投资规模虽然取得了一定进展，但同今年计划的要求还有很大的距离，特别是由于不少地区和部门存在观望等待情绪，强调自己的特殊性，互相比照，很多应该停缓建的项目还没有停下来，不少已经停下来的项目还有“死灰复燃”的危险。因此，实现今年压缩投资规模、调整投资结构的要求，必须狠下决心，采取过硬的措施。第一，坚决把清理在建项目的工作抓到底。不仅那些不应该搞的楼堂馆所等非生产性建设项目，以及不必要的重复建设项目，要坚决压下来，就是一些应该搞的项目，包括能源、交通和原材料工业项目，也要根据财力、物力的可能合理安排，有的也要停缓建。对已签订合同的利用外资项目，除了少数经过双方协商同意撤销或推迟的以外，要严格履行合同。城乡集体和个体的建设项目也要认真清理压缩。只有坚决下一大批项目，投资规模才能真正压下来。对于停缓建的项目，要认真做好善后工作。第二，严格控制新开工项目。各部门、各地区除了必须新开工的若干农林水利、化肥、教育等项目按规定报批开工以外，其他所有项目在今年７月底以前一律不得开工。８月以后是否开工，要看压缩投资规模情况和当时的经济形势再定。第三，按照产业政策合理安排投资，调整投资结构。在坚决压缩楼堂馆所等非生产性建设和一般加工工业建设投资的基础上，适当增加农业、交通、煤炭、教育等方面的投资。第四，对银行投资贷款实行指令性计划管理，严格控制通过社会集资扩大建设规模。对一般乡镇企业、个体经济和国家计划外项目，今年不发放投资性的贷款。
    （二）控制消费需求过快增长，逐步缓解社会分配不公的矛盾。治理通货膨胀，不仅要压缩投资规模，还必须严格控制消费需求的过快增长，坚决扭转延续多年的消费增长超过生产增长的状况。李鹏总理在政府工作报告中提出，在治理整顿期间，政府和人民都要有过几年紧日子的思想准备。这是完全正确和十分重要的。这几年，奢侈浪费的现象相当普遍、相当严重。不少机关、团体和企事业单位用公款请客送礼、滥发钱物，在许多活动中讲排场、比阔气；不少设施盲目追求现代化，标准越来越高。凡此种种，不仅严重脱离了我国现阶段经济发展水平，而且损害了我们的优良传统，助长了不良的社会风气。必须坚决纠正这种状况，刹住这种歪风，大力宣传和贯彻执行艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国、勤俭办一切事业的方针，反对和克服各种铺张浪费现象，严格控制消费需求的过快增长。只有下决心过几年紧日子，过大的社会总需求才能真正压下来，通货膨胀也才能得到有效的遏制。
    在如何控制消费需求过快增长方面，我们还缺乏经验，切实有效的办法还不多，需要依靠广大干部和群众共同努力，在实践中积极探索。从目前的情况来看，首先要采取严厉措施，继续压缩集团消费。计划要求，今年的社会集团消费不仅不能增加，还要比上年压缩２０％。第二，加强对工资基金的管理。要切实改进和完善企业职工工资总额同经济效益挂钩的办法，使职工工资增长真正建立在生产发展和劳动生产率提高的基础上；通过整顿和加强企业自有资金的管理与监督，坚决制止滥发各种补贴和实物；整顿和改进各类公司工资和奖金的发放办法，建立和健全合理的工资制度和财务制度；严格按国家的规定，征收奖金税和工资调节税。今年职工工资总额将继续有所增加，但增长幅度要控制在国力能够承受的范围以内，以利于实现控制物价上涨幅度的要求。第三，尽快建立和完善个人应税收入的申报制度，进一步加强个人收入调节税的征收工作，以逐步缓解收入差别悬殊的矛盾。第四，要通过压缩投资规模、整顿公司、关停并转企业和优化劳动组合，清退压缩近几年从农村进城的基建包工队、农民临时工和计划外用工，严格控制从社会招工补充自然减员。第五，采取增加城乡居民储蓄、推行住宅商品化等多种措施，合理引导购买力分流，吸收和推迟一部分当前的消费需求，以利于稳定市场。
    （三）争取农业生产，特别是粮食、棉花、油料生产有较大增长。实践反复证明，农业生产对整个国民经济的发展起着极大的推动或制约作用。力争今年农业生产特别是粮食、棉花、油料生产有较大增长，是增加有效供给、稳定经济、抑制通货膨胀的基础。今年计划安排，粮食产量４．１亿吨，比上年增加１６００万吨；棉花产量４５０万吨，增加３０万吨；油料作物产量１６００万吨，增加２８０万吨；糖料产量６５００万吨，增加２６３万吨。要继续鼓励生猪生产，肉类总产量安排２３４０万吨，增加２０万吨。
    实现今年农业生产目标，增加农副产品的有效供给，必须认真贯彻去年１１月中共中央、国务院召开的全国农村工作会议精神，在继续深化农村改革的同时，在计划安排上采取一些有力措施：第一，适当增加粮食、棉花的种植面积，压缩烤烟等的面积，不准再毁田挖鱼塘和占用耕地发展水果生产。第二，增加农业开发资金。今年在财政金融紧缩的情况下，中央财政对农业的投入计划比去年增长１０％以上；地方财政也要多拿出一些资金用于农业。农业银行和信用社的农业贷款也将有较大增加。从今年起，还将通过多种渠道筹集资金，建立农业发展基金。与此同时，特别要鼓励农民增加对农业的投入。第三，建设农产品商品生产基地。要把改造低产田同建设商品基地结合起来进行，把现有的各项农业投资适当集中使用，继续建设一批国家级的粮、棉、糖商品基地。第四，加强贫困地区的经济开发，管好用好来自各条渠道的扶贫资金，统筹安排，集中使用，努力提高经济效益。第五，继续推广农业科学技术。今年要求扩大杂交水稻面积１０００万亩、杂交玉米面积２０００万亩，增加地膜覆盖面积１６００万亩。大力推广科学施肥技术，增加配方施肥面积。第六，增加农业生产资料供应。１９８９年计划安排化肥产量８５００万吨，农药产量２０万吨，加上进口，供应量都比去年有所增加。要鼓励农民多种绿肥，多施农家肥，并动员和组织农民搞好农田水利建设。
    当前，要加强夏收作物的后期管理，在继续抓好抗旱工作的同时，注意防止由于去冬气温偏高今春发生病虫害，努力夺取夏粮丰收。
    （四）将过高的工业速度降下来，并认真调整生产结构。把过高的工业增长速度降低到计划规定的适当水平，是治理经济环境、消除经济过热的迫切要求，也是经济调整的必然结果。不能把这种增长速度的合理下降视作不正常的生产滑坡。增加有效供给，关键在于调整生产结构，把该保的保上去，该压的压下来。当前最核心的问题是要把煤炭生产搞上去。有了煤才能多发电，增产短缺原材料，特别是短缺钢材。当然，解决煤的问题，同时也要解决好运输问题。国务院正在组织有关部门和地区采取切实有效的措施，稳定和增加地方中小煤矿的生产，认真组织和改进煤炭的调运工作。铁路煤炭运输要实行统一计划、统一运输，并进行严格管理。在增加能源和原材料生产的基础上，积极增产人民生活必需的日用工业品，适销的轻纺产品和紧俏产品，以及出口创汇产品。要促使那些产品质量和性能差、大量消耗能源和短缺原材料的企业停产或转产。特别是对那些没有正当原料来源的家用电器、易拉罐、小棉纺、小毛纺、小卷烟、小塑料、小铝材厂等，不仅不许增建，还要关停和转产一批。能源、短缺原材料、运力和银行贷款的分配，都要体现调整生产结构的要求和扶优限劣的原则，优先保证担负国家重点生产任务的骨干企业的需要，保证经济效益好的企业的需要。所有企业都要抓好技术进步和改进管理，努力搞好资源的节约与综合利用，降低物质消耗，提高劳动生产率，改善产品质量，减少资金占用，增进经济效益。要深入持久地开展增产节约、增收节支运动，并取得切实的成效。
    今年以来，全民所有制工业的增长速度下降较多，而集体所有制工业特别是乡镇工业过高的增长速度没有得到有效控制。乡镇工业和村办工业要调整产品结构，改进经营作风，着重提高经济效益，治理环境污染，并把增长速度降到合理水平。
    （五）妥善调整进出口商品结构，进一步扩大对外经济合作和技术交流。治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序同坚持对外开放是互相促进的。坚持对外开放的方针，充分利用开放的有利条件，积极发展对外贸易和外向型经济，可以调剂国内供需，增加有效供给，扩大出口创汇，有利于抑制通货膨胀，减少治理整顿中的困难。另一方面，搞好治理整顿工作，可以为对外开放、发展外向型经济创造有利的环境。今年要进一步发展对外经济合作和技术交流，继续实施沿海地区经济发展战略。
    要在合理调整进出口商品结构的基础上，努力扩大对外贸易，增加外汇收入。要统筹兼顾内外销的需要，逐步减少资源性产品、初加工产品的出口比重，增加机电产品等工业制成品的出口，并大力发展进料加工和来料加工。在进口安排上，要优先考虑关系国计民生的重要商品的进口，严格控制某些高档消费品进口和重复引进技术与设备；对国内能自行生产供应的商品，要控制或禁止进口。
    沿海地区要在治理、整顿中利用当前比较有利的时机，发挥自己的优势，从实际出发，调整经济结构，积极发展重要原材料供应和产品销售两头在外的外向型经济。要继续引进国外的资金、先进技术和管理经验，利用我国原有企业进行改造，兴办中外合资、合作企业，并继续鼓励外商来华兴办独资企业。
    （六）进一步发展科技教育和文化卫生体育事业。今年要继续按照“七五”计划确定的部署，集中必要的人力、财力、物力，重点抓好２０个成套技术、１００个重点工艺、４００个重要产品的科技攻关，争取拿到一批成果。继续抓好宝钢二期工程等１１项重大技术装备的研制、攻关，提高国产化水平。要有步骤有重点地研究和开发高技术。重视和加强基础科学和基础理论的研究。积极推广先进适用的科学技术，抓好由国家鉴定验收的１５个工业性试验项目，抓好国家级重大新产品试产计划的实施，继续推行“星火计划”，逐步实施“火炬计划”，促进社会生产技术进步和科研成果向商品转化。
    要切实把教育事业放在重要的战略地位，在治理整顿中确保其发展。今年在全国压缩财政支出和基建投资的情况下，各级政府作了很大努力，使教育经费、教育投资继续有所增加，使教师的工作条件和生活条件继续有所改善。要继续提倡和鼓励社会各方面集资办学。高等教育要本着调整结构、按需招生、提高质量的方针，适当控制研究生招生人数，稳定普通高等学校招生人数。１９８９年计划安排，研究生招生４万人，普通高校招生６４万人，大体保持１９８８年计划水平。成人教育要把重点放到加强对在职职工的培训上来。继续发展职业技术教育，使普及教育同发展职业技术教育密切结合起来。进一步发展中小学教育，认真贯彻执行义务教育法，对一些地方出现的中小学生辍学、弃学现象要及时予以纠正；同时，要抓紧进行中小学校的危房改造。各级各类学校都要改革和加强德育工作，促进学生德智体美全面发展。
    文学艺术、广播、电影、电视和新闻出版等各项文化事业，要坚持为人民服务、为社会主义服务的方向，坚持百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，正确处理经济效益和社会效益的关系，为广大群众提供丰富健康的精神营养，在促进社会主义物质文明和精神文明建设中发挥积极作用。
    卫生事业要继续贯彻预防为主的方针，并加强卫生队伍的建设，为社会提供优质服务；体育事业要在加强队伍建设的同时，进一步开展群众性体育活动，促进整个民族健康水平的不断提高。
    我国人口基数大，目前又处在生育高峰，计划生育工作一定要抓紧抓好，千万不能放松。要进一步加强宣传教育，坚决按照现行的计划生育政策，严格控制人口增长，提高人口素质，以促进经济发展和社会进步。
    三、全面深化改革，加强和改进宏观经济调控，努力实现１９８９年计划
    把治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序同全面深化改革紧密结合起来，是实现１９８９年计划最重要的保证。治理整顿同深化改革是统一的、相辅相成的。治理整顿不仅要在坚持改革大方向的前提下进行，而且从根本上说，只有依靠改革的深入，才能取得应有成效。另一方面，在当前情况下，只有通过治理、整顿，才能在宏观上为深化改革创造比较好的经济社会环境，因此各项改革要紧紧围绕治理整顿来进行。今年要着重完善和发展正在实行的各项改革措施，并适应治理整顿的要求，进行一些新的改革探索。关于今年经济体制改革的主要任务，李鹏总理在政府工作报告中已经作了全面的说明，这里着重讲以下三点意见。
    第一，进一步完善和发展企业承包经营责任制。消化涨价因素，增加财政收入，保证市场供应，归根到底，要靠企业特别是大中型国有企业提高经济效益。大中型企业在我国经济生活中占有举足轻重的地位，拥有较好的技术装备和管理经验，拥有众多的人才，应该也完全可以在提高经济效益、增加有效供给方面作出更多的贡献。今年能源、运力和主要原材料供应比较紧张，资金供应也相当紧张，企业的生产经营面临着许多困难，必须通过深化改革，充分调动广大职工的积极性和主动性，来克服这些困难。企业承包经营责任制要在总结经验的基础上加以完善和发展，增强企业自我约束的能力和对市场变化的适应能力。认真贯彻执行《企业法》，继续推行厂长负责制，强化企业管理，优化劳动组合。同时，要适应经济调整的要求，积极推进企业的兼并、联合，发展企业集团，优化企业组织结构。在抓紧制定章程、条例的基础上，稳妥地进行以公有制为主体的股份制试点。
    第二，大力整顿经济秩序特别是流通秩序，促进社会主义商品经济新秩序的建设。要继续搞好清理、整顿公司的工作，大力减少流通环节和中间盘剥，特别是要严肃整治各种违法经营。继续培育各类商品和物资的交易市场，加强市场的组织和建设，健全市场运行规则，建立市场正常秩序。对关系国计民生的重要生产资料和消费品，要区别情况采取不同的流通方式和管理办法。严格物价管理，坚决防止和纠正乱涨价、变相涨价。切实组织好市场商品供应，突出的是要搞好粮、棉、油、糖、肉等重要农产品的收购、调拨，并保证大中城市的蔬菜种植面积，增加供应和稳定价格。大中城市要列出一批人民生活必需的商品目录，保证这些商品的市场供应和价格的基本稳定。
    第三，切实加强和改进宏观经济调控。推进治理整顿和全面深化改革，发展有计划的商品经济，都要求把加强和改进宏观调控放到突出的地位上来。根据新旧体制转换时期经济运行的特点和经济生活中存在的问题，当前加强和改进宏观调控，需要在加强综合平衡的同时着重解决好以下几个问题：
    一是强化中央银行管理和调节社会资金的能力。中央银行和专业银行都是国家银行，都必须执行国家的政策，承担宏观经济调控的职能。要加强中央银行对专业银行和其它金融机构的领导与管理，加强中央银行系统的垂直领导；地方政府对银行业务要积极地进行帮助，但不能在国家信贷计划之外摊派贷款。当前，加强银行调控能力需要解决的突出问题，是要千方百计增加信用回笼，扩大储蓄存款。现在城乡居民储蓄存款回升不快，企业存款下降，各种社会集资和不通过银行的现金结算不断增加，造成银行贷款资金来源减少，货币投放控制不住，既导致不少企业特别是大中型企业流动资金紧张，又严重削弱了银行调控社会资金的能力。为了改变这种状况，一方面要采取加强宣传教育等各种有效措施，增加城乡居民储蓄，使广大群众懂得，增加储蓄既可以支持国家推进治理整顿工作，又有利于在通货膨胀情况下减少自己的损失，从而踊跃参加储蓄。另一方面，要加强对机关、团体、企事业单位的现金管理，严格控制社会各种集资活动，同时坚决打击和取缔高利贷等违法活动，把分散沉积的社会资金尽量纳入银行的周转渠道中来。
    二是适当提高财政收入在国民收入中的比重。这几年，财政收入占国民收入的比重逐年下降，现在已下降到２０％以下。同时，中央财政收入占全部财政收入的比重也过低，目前还不到５０％。在我们这样大的发展中国家，这个比例不能适应加强宏观调控的需要，也难以从根本上扭转近几年国家财政特别是中央财政的困难局面。无论从当前和长远发展的需要来看，国家财政收入占国民收入的比重，中央财政收入占全部财政收入的比重，都应适当提高。从今年开始，就要朝着这个方向逐步前进。
    在加强财政、金融管理的同时，要加强外汇、外债的统一管理，并采取有效的措施，正确引导地方、部门和企业留成外汇的使用方向。
    三是制定和实施适合我国实际的产业政策。当前，我国经济在产业结构上存在着比较严重的问题。制定正确的产业政策，是调整产业结构、实行宏观调控的重要依据。组织制定产业政策是一项非常复杂的工作，需要各个方面互相配合，共同努力，才能做好。同时，要综合运用经济的、行政的和法律的手段促其实现。现在，这项工作刚刚开始进行，要在实践中不断加以改进和完善。
    加强宏观调控，归根到底，要体现在中央能够说话算数，做到令行禁止。李鹏总理在政府工作报告中十分强调要维护政令的统一，指出没有必要的集中统一，调整经济、克服困难是根本不可能的。（⑵⑶）
    要做到这一点，关键是要正确处理局部利益和全局利益的关系，坚持局部服从全局的原则。治理通货膨胀，调整经济结构，必然要对既定的利益格局进行某些必要的调整。这种调整也必然会要求某些局部作出暂时的牺牲，以换来全局的稳定和发展。如果所有地方、部门、企业和个人的既得利益都不能动，那么经济调整就会落空。因此，各级领导干部都要顾全大局，以身作则，清正廉明，艰苦奋斗；同时要加强思想政治工作，发扬民主作风，把当前的问题，采取各种措施的理由，以及光明的前景，如实地向群众讲清楚，并尊重和吸收群众中的一切好的意见，带领和动员群众共同克服困难。
    各位代表！十年改革和建设为我们奠定了较好的物质基础，当前国际环境也对我们有利。尽管我们面临不少困难和问题，治理、整顿、调整的难度相当大，但是，只要我们紧紧依靠和团结全国各族人民，坚决贯彻执行治理整顿和深化改革的方针，就一定能够全面实现１９８９年计划，就一定能够逐步克服前进中的暂时困难，使社会主义现代化建设事业稳步健康地向前发展。
