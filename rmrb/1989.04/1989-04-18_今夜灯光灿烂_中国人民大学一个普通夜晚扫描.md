We randomly chose the evening of March 31, an ordinary night at Renmin University of China, to scan the reading and living conditions of the students here.

**Library, Finding a Seat is Difficult**

At 7:35 PM, the lights were just on, and the campus was quiet.

In the newspaper reading room, five readers were standing in front of a four-page newspaper, each stretching their necks to read.

The literature and history reading room was full. We quietly walked to a male student who was sitting there. He was a student from the history department, class of 1986. He softly told us that he was helping a professor in his department find some materials. He said, "During my first and second years, I used to run a small stall and sell things. Now, when it comes to real work, I realize how shallow my knowledge is."

In the economics reading room, we quietly chatted with a student who was reading "Friedman and Modern Monetary Theory." She said, "As we are about to graduate, I realize that there are still many things I haven't learned well. I feel like I've wasted a lot of time. Now, society's requirements for university graduates are getting higher and higher. Without real skills, there is no future. I am trying to make up for lost time now."

Almost every seat in the reading room was occupied by a head buried in books or bags. The "seat-saving trend" was quietly resurfacing. A student from the agricultural economics department, surnamed Zhou, said dejectedly, "I came late today and couldn't find a seat. But last year at this time, you could sit wherever you wanted. It's really strange."

**OK, "English Corner"**

At 9:00 PM, the fragrance of magnolia flowers filled the school garden. We came to the fountain side. This place, which often sows love in the night, now gathered over 100 English enthusiasts from Peking University, Tsinghua University, Beijing Normal University, and other schools.

This is Renmin University's traditional "English Corner." Since its inception in 1985, every Friday night, it attracts many people who want to practice their spoken English. The time ranges from 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM or even midnight. Often, young men and women who are still enthusiastic about learning will continue to chat in English even after midnight.

We asked a history student in Chinese whether he wanted to take the TOEFL. He immediately widened his eyes and said, "Why learn a foreign language just to take the TOEFL?" He said that mastering a foreign language is a "trump card" for standing firm in society. Several female students from the class of 1985 also came together. When asked, they replied, "We found that when looking for a job, those who are good at foreign languages, especially spoken English, are given priority in recruitment."

**Candlelit Readers**

At 11:00 PM, the lights in the student dormitories were turned off, but the dormitories did not become quiet. In Building 9, we found that about 40 to 50 rooms had dim lights. Someone guessed: Could they be playing mahjong? Last year, playing mahjong was very popular on campus. We randomly knocked on the door of Room 414 and found that in the dim candlelight, someone was reading a book. Two others were using flashlights to read. A student surnamed Tan was reviewing English. He told us that he would take the English proficiency test in June and always felt that time was not enough. He took advantage of the quiet night to review more words. In contrast, another roommate seemed more relaxed. He was using a flashlight to read "Dream of the Red Chamber." He said that many economics books were also read under the flashlight. He took out the first volume of "Das Kapital," and we saw that it was filled with dense annotations. "I always feel that it's time to read some books systematically," he said.

We knocked on a few more rooms with candlelight in Building 9, and the situations were almost the same. This building is located at the west gate of the campus and was once called "Renmin University's Siberia." During the peak of the "business fever" and "mahjong fever," it was the hottest place. These dim candlelights, do they signify another kind of "fever" rising?

**How to Tell Him the Benefits of Reading?**

In the campus of Peking University, a self-funded student is using dining hall coupons to "buy books." According to the owner of the bookstall, "Self-funded students are generally diligent and eager to learn. There are more than 20 people who exchange coupons for books every day."

　　今夜灯光灿烂
　　——中国人民大学一个普通夜晚扫描
　　胡富　周石军
    我们随意选择了３月３１日中国人民大学一个平平常常的夜晚，对这里的学生读书生活作了一次扫描。
　图书馆，找座位颇不易
    １９点３５分，华灯初上，校园里静悄悄。
    阅报室一张对开四版的报纸前竟站着５位读者，每个人只好“抻”着脖子阅读。
    文史阅览室座无虚席。我们轻轻走到一位男生身旁，他是历史系８６级的，他小声告诉我们，他正在帮系里一位教授查找资料。他说：“一、二年级时我摆过小摊，倒腾过东西，现在一动真格的，才知道自己很浅。”
    在财经阅览室，我们和一位正在读《弗里德曼与现代货币主义》的同学细声聊起来。她说：“快毕业了，我发现还有许多东西没学扎实，感到浪费了不少时间。现在社会对大学毕业生的要求越来越高，没有真才实学是没有出路的。我现在算是亡羊补牢吧。”
    阅览室里几乎每个座位上都埋着一个脑袋，或者被书包占着。“占座风”又悄然重演了。农经系一位姓周的小伙子懊丧地说：“我今天来迟了，没找到座位。可去年这时候你爱坐哪就坐那，真邪门了。”
　ＯＫ，“英语角”
    ２１点整。学校花园里玉兰花香飘。我们来到了喷池旁边。这块在夜晚常常播种爱情的地方，现在聚集了来自北大、清华、北师院等校的１００多名英语爱好者。
    这就是人民大学富有传统的“英语角”。自从１９８５年诞生以来，每星期五晚上都汇聚着众多想练习口语的人们，时间从９点到夜里１１点、１２点不等。常有兴犹未尽的小伙子们和姑娘们子夜之后仍在叽哩咕噜。
    我们用汉语问一位学历史的学生是不是想考托福，他立即瞪着眼说：“为什么学外语就是为了考托福？”他说掌握一门外语是今后立足社会的一张“王牌”。某系８５级几位女生也结伴来了，问之，答曰：“我们在找单位时发现总是外语尤其是口语好的被优先录用。”
　烛光下的读书者
    ２３点，学生宿舍楼熄灯了，但宿舍却不因此而平静下来。在９号宿舍楼，我们发现夜色中有四五十个宿舍有微弱的灯光，有人便猜：会不会他们在打麻将？去年，打麻将曾在校园里热了一阵子。我们随意敲开了４１４宿舍，却见在朦胧的烛光下有人在看书，还有两个人亮着手电筒，也是在看书。一位姓谭的同学在背英语。他告诉我们说，今年６月份就要参加英语四级统考，总感到时间不够用，趁这更深夜静多背几个单词。相比之下，同宿舍的另一位显得悠闲点，他打着手电筒在品味《红楼梦》。他说，许多经济学书籍也是借着手电看完的。他掏出《资本论》第一卷，我们看到里面密密麻麻作了许多注解，“我总感到现在是系统地读些书的时候了”，他说。
    我们在９号楼又敲开几个有烛光的宿舍，碰到的情形几乎雷同。这座楼地处校园西门，曾被称为“人大的西伯利亚”，“经商热”和“麻将热”盛行的时候，这里“热”得最厉害。这些幽幽的烛光，是否意味着另一种“热”在升起？
