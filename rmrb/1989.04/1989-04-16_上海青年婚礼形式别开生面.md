Xinhua News Agency reports: (Reporter Yan Weimin) The rigid, "contributing money" style of traditional wedding banquets has become a shared burden for both the newlyweds and the guests, and many young people in Shanghai have grown tired of it. Increasingly, couples are seeking new forms of wedding ceremonies to add unique touches to their lifelong happiness.

Dance party weddings and salon weddings are becoming more common in Shanghai. In the rhythms of the "Waltz" and the "Rumba," the newlyweds gracefully dance to greet their guests, which appears more elegant than the traditional wedding banquet where they would walk around tables toasting their relatives and friends. Wedding concerts are also unique. The white wedding dress, flickering candlelight, and the melodies of famous Chinese and foreign songs like "Spring Festival Overture," "Wedding March," and "La Traviata" create a joyful and sweet atmosphere.

　　上海青年婚礼形式别开生面
    据新华社讯　（记者严卫民）程式化、“凑份子”式的旧式婚宴，不仅成为结婚者和祝贺者的共同负担，也使上海一些年轻人感到厌烦。越来越多的新人寻找各种新的婚礼形式，刻意为自己的百年好合增添新的色彩。
    舞会婚礼、沙龙婚礼目前在上海已趋普遍。在“华尔兹”、“伦巴”的旋律中，新人迈着舞步向来宾们致意，比旧式婚宴绕着桌子给亲友们敬酒显得更加高雅。婚礼音乐会也别开生面。白色的纱裙、跳跃的烛光和“春节序曲”、“婚礼进行曲”、“茶花女”等中外名曲的旋律，烘托出幸福、甜蜜的气氛。
