Using the 277th Train Case as a Breakthrough, the Taiyuan Railway Bureau Begins to Rectify

Our reporter learned that after the theft on the 277th train, the Taiyuan Railway Bureau began a comprehensive rectification of its security police teams, passenger transport sections, and vehicle sections.

The Party Committee of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau requires that disciplinary and professional ethics education be conducted among the staff, and that similar issues be checked. The vehicle section has decided that vehicle inspection personnel will be reassigned every half year, adjusting routes and train numbers. It is understood that relevant departments of the Beijing Railway Bureau have sent personnel to assist in the rectification.

In addition, the Party Committee of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau has decided that it will not allow subordinate units to intervene on behalf of others in the name of organization and leadership. If such cases are discovered, they will be dealt with seriously.
