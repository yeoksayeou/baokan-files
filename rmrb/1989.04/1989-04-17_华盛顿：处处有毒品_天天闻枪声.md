Washington: Drugs Everywhere, Gunshots Every Day

Reporter: Cang Lide

Time: March 14, this year.
Location: A block near Capitol Hill in Washington.
Event: Senator Hartfield was driving home with his family from a restaurant when a man suddenly appeared in front of his car. At that moment, five gunshots rang out from the sidewalk, hitting the man in the leg. He fled the scene. Senator Hartfield did not report the incident to the police but instead sped away from the "trouble spot."

This incident, while shocking, is not uncommon in Washington. What made it newsworthy was that the witness was a senator. It is said that the senator later explained that he did not report the incident because it was not worth making a fuss over, and also because the police were too busy to handle so many cases.

The frequent gunshot and murder cases in Washington are indeed alarming. According to police investigations, most of these cases are related to drug trafficking, mainly concentrated in the northeast part of the city. A significant portion of the perpetrators and victims are black youths under the age of 20. Last year, the Washington area saw 554 murders, making it the city with the highest murder rate in the United States, surpassing New York for the first time. No wonder Washington is now known as the "drug capital" and "murder capital."

The crime wave in Washington has sparked outrage from various sectors. Currently, it is the cherry blossom season, and the tourism industry is worried that visitors might be deterred, affecting the approximately $2 billion annual revenue. The business community is concerned that investors from other regions might reduce their investments due to a lack of security, threatening Washington's economic prosperity and employment rate. The Congress has repeatedly urged the municipal authorities to formulate plans to combat criminal activities. The media has described the capital's security as "out of control."

The authorities also have their own difficulties, such as insufficient police personnel, outdated equipment, and inadequate funding. The city council recently passed a bill to implement a curfew in the city, prohibiting minors under 18 from being out after 11 PM, but it was criticized as "unconstitutional" and "without precedent," and was eventually shelved. More troubling is the fact that all prisons are overcrowded. The city's prisons are holding approximately 2,000 more inmates than their capacity, not to mention the additional 2,700 criminals sent to federal and other state prisons...

It should be said that the rampant murders in Washington are just a microcosm of the drug crime epidemic sweeping across the United States. Some say that now, in almost every neighborhood in American cities, you can buy drugs; drug culture has become part of some American subcultures, and drug use and trafficking have become the way of life for many. According to statistics, in 1986, 21,000 infants were abandoned in the United States, many of which were due to young mothers being destitute and unable to support their children because of drug addiction. A train driver once caused a major accident, resulting in multiple casualties, due to drug-induced confusion. Recently, in a primary school in Virginia, when students were asked to mimic behaviors they were familiar with, many innocent children vividly acted out street drug transactions, leaving teachers shocked and heartbroken.

Most American citizens strongly condemn drug crimes. In numerous public opinion polls, anti-drug efforts have consistently been ranked as the top priority. Since taking office, Bush has repeatedly stated that combating drugs will be one of the most important government agendas. Recently, he has been traveling around, visiting anti-drug education centers, consoling drug enforcement officers, announcing a ban on the import of semi-automatic rifles, and demanding swift punishment for drug traffickers who kill police officers. The Supreme Court has issued an order for mandatory drug testing for workers in industries involving personal safety and law enforcement personnel. Along the coast, 12 states have deployed the National Guard and their helicopters to assist police in anti-drug operations. New York State is in heated debate over the restoration of the death penalty. To restore order in Washington and regain its image as a "city of goodwill," the federal government has designated the District of Columbia as a key experimental zone for national drug eradication and is discussing the use of federal police to support Washington's anti-drug operations.

Facing strong public pressure and severe criticism from Congress, Washington Mayor Barry unveiled an anti-drug plan on April 4, requesting $102 million from the White House to hire 800 more police officers, upgrade and renovate electronic communication equipment and weapons, expand anti-drug propaganda and education, and reward informants. Most of the funds will be used to build a new prison that can accommodate 1,500 inmates.

However, drug crimes in the United States have deep social, economic roots and complex international backgrounds. Therefore, this "war on drugs" can only be a "long-term battle." The federal drug eradication director, Bennett, also said, "I do not expect this problem to be solved in 15-20 years," but hopes to see visible progress in the next three to four years.

### 华盛顿：处处有毒品　天天闻枪声

　　华盛顿：处处有毒品　天天闻枪声
    本报记者　仓立德
    时间：今年３月１４日。
    地点：华盛顿国会山附近一街区。
    事件：参议员哈特菲尔德正驱车带着妻小自餐馆返家，突见一人窜到车前。此刻从人行道那边“砰砰”射来５发枪弹，这位男子腿部中弹，落荒而逃。哈氏见状未去报警，而是一踩油门逃出了“是非之地”。
    这件事在近日的华盛顿本属司空见惯，只因这次的目击者是位参议员，才被新闻界抓住大做了一番文章。据说，这位议员事后表示，他之所以未报警，一来这事不值得大惊小怪，二来警察局也太忙，“来不及”处理那么多案件。
    华盛顿层出不穷的枪击案、凶杀案的确令人触目惊心。据警方调查，大多数案件与毒品交易有关，主要集中在该市东北部；凶手与死者相当一部分是２０岁以下的黑人青年。去年，华盛顿地区有５５４人被杀，凶杀率之高已超过纽约，首次名列全美各大都市之冠。难怪当今美国首都已被人们称为“处处有毒品、天天闻枪声”的“毒品之都”、“凶杀之都”。
    华盛顿的犯罪浪潮激起各界人士的不满。眼下正是樱花怒放时节，旅游业担心各地游人对此地望而却步，影响每年约２０亿美元的巨额收入。忧心忡忡的经济界认为外地投资者会因缺乏安全感而减少投资，威胁华盛顿的经济繁荣和就业率。国会一再督促市政当局拟定打击刑事犯罪方案。报界称首都治安已经“失去控制”。
    当局也有苦衷和难处，比如警察人手不足，装备落后，经费短绌等等。市议会不久前曾通过一项在市区实行宵禁的议案，禁止１８岁以下青少年在晚间１１点以后上街，但被指责为“违宪”，“没有先例”，结果不了了之。更头痛的是所有监狱人满为患，市属监狱关押的囚犯已超员约２０００人，这还不算被送往联邦政府及其他各州监狱的另外２７００名案犯……
    应该说，华盛顿凶杀案的猖獗只是全美毒品犯罪泛滥成灾的一个缩影。有人说，现在美国各城镇几乎每个街区都可买到毒品；毒品文化已成为美国一些亚文化的组成部分，吸毒、贩毒成为不少人的生活方式。据统计，１９８６年全美有２．１万名婴儿惨遭遗弃，多与年轻母亲因吸毒倾家荡产、无力抚养有关。一位火车司机曾因吸毒精神恍惚，造成火车出轨、多人伤亡的重大事故。最近弗吉尼亚州某小学让学生模仿自己熟悉的行为时，不少天真学童竟活灵活现地表演起街头毒品交易情形，使教师们惊诧之余深感痛心。
    大多数美国公民都对毒品犯罪深恶痛绝。在多次民意测验中，反毒均列为公众心目中的头等大事。布什上台后，多次表示将扫毒作为最重要的政府议程之一。最近他四处奔走，视察反毒教育中心，慰问缉毒警察，宣布禁止进口半自动步枪，要求从快惩处杀害警察的贩毒分子，对要犯处于极刑。最高法院发布命令，对涉及人身安全行业的职工、缉毒执法人员等实行强制性抽样吸毒检查。沿海有１２个州动用国民警卫队及其直升飞机等装备协助警察扫毒。纽约州正在激烈辩论恢复死刑问题。为了整顿华盛顿的治安，恢复其“尊善之区”的形象，联邦政府已将哥伦比亚特区列为全国重点肃毒实验区，并正在讨论用联邦警察支持华盛顿地区的禁毒行动。
    面对强大的舆论压力和国会的严厉指责，华盛顿市长巴里４月４日推出一项反毒计划，要求白宫增拨１．０２亿美元经费，用于增雇８００名警官、添置、改造电子通讯设备及武器装备、扩大反毒品宣传教育、奖励检举犯罪活动等。大部分款项将用来建造可容纳１５００名犯人的新监狱。
    然而，美国的毒品犯罪有着深刻的社会、经济根源和复杂的国际背景，因此这场“反毒大战”只能是“持久战”。联邦肃毒总监贝内特也表示“不指望这个问题能在１５—２０年得到解决”，只求“在三四年内能有看得见的进展”。
