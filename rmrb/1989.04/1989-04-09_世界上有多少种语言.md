	The Soviet magazine *Today's Asia and Africa* reports that there are 5,651 known languages in the world. According to a survey report from UNESCO, there are 2,759 languages in the world. Generally, it is believed that there are approximately 2,000 to 3,000 languages in the world. Over 1,400 languages are either not recognized as independent languages or are on the verge of extinction. Many languages that were once widely used have gradually become secondary languages. There are also about 20 languages that are almost no longer spoken. Among the independent languages, about 500 languages have been relatively well studied, while the remaining 3/4 of the world's languages still do not have a written form.

	There are 13 languages in the world with more than 50 million speakers: Chinese, English, Russian, Hindi, Spanish, German, Japanese, French, Indonesian, Portuguese, Italian, Bengali, and Arabic. Among these, 30 countries speak Spanish, 15 countries speak English, 13 countries speak Arabic, 9 countries speak French, and 3 countries speak German.

	Chinese is the language with the most speakers in the world.

	The language with the fewest speakers in the world is Wod, which is spoken by only 50 people.

　　世界上有多少种语言
    据苏联《今日亚非》杂志说，世界上已知的语言有５６５１种，又据联合国教科文组织的调查报告，世界上有２７５９种语言。一般认为，世界上的语种约在２０００—３０００之间。有１４００种以上的语言，或是根本没有被承认为独立的语种，或是行将消亡的语种。有不少语言原先是广泛使用的，现在已渐渐变成次要语种。还有约２０种语言几乎无人会说了。在独立语言中，约有５００种语言得到人们较为充分的研究，占全世界３／４强的语言仍然没有文字。
    世界上使用人数超过５０００万的语言有１３种：汉、英、俄、印地、西班牙、德、日、法、印尼、葡萄牙、意大利、孟加拉和阿拉伯语。其中，有３０个国家讲西班牙语，１５个国家讲英语，１３个国家讲阿拉伯语，９个国家讲法语，３个国家讲德语。
    汉语是世界上使用人数最多的一种语言。
    世界上使用人数最少的语言是沃德语，只有５０个人使用。
