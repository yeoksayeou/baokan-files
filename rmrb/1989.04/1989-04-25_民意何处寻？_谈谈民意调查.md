Title: Where to Find Public Opinion? – A Discussion on Public Opinion Polls

More than a hundred years ago, U.S. President Lincoln once asked, “My wish is to act according to the will of the people, but the question is how to know the true will of the people?” Today, people have finally found a method—public opinion polls.

Public opinion polls select a sample of a certain number of respondents to inquire about their attitudes and opinions on major issues, thereby inferring the direction of public opinion. In modern society, this method can provide government decision-making departments with information about public will, and it is also an effective tool for academic institutions and commercial enterprises to obtain information about people's psychology and behavior.

In recent years, public opinion polls have become a “hot topic” that the Chinese public is increasingly paying attention to, and various surveys have emerged one after another. In fact, public opinion polls were introduced into China not long ago. It can be said that it was not until the late 1970s that they began to take shape. At that time, some newspapers conducted surveys among workers on their views on major social and political issues, and the China Rural Development Research Group conducted surveys among farmers on their psychological reactions to poverty and wealth issues.

In 1982, China saw the emergence of true public opinion polls. That summer, the Capital News Society organized the “Beijing City Readers, Listeners, and Viewers Survey.” This survey, from questionnaire design, sampling methods, survey implementation to data processing, all adopted international public opinion poll standards and methods. Since 1985, the China Social Survey System and its predecessor, the Social Department of the China Economic System Reform Research Institute, have successively conducted surveys on social psychological reactions to price reforms, social security system reforms, and political system reforms, introducing public opinion poll methods into reform decision-making research. The China Public Opinion Research Center, while conducting public opinion surveys on social conditions and public opinion during the reform, also provides data and information for academic research and market surveys, completing many significant public opinion polls.

Looking back at the development history of public opinion polls, we can see that the role played by public opinion polls at their inception is quite different from their current role in the world's political, economic, and cultural life. At that time, in the fierce competition among newspapers, editors and reporters were racking their brains to attract readers, thus conducting public opinion polls on presidential election voting intentions (also known as mock voting). Newspapers or magazine companies predicted the results of presidential elections based on street or roadside surveys of passersby or mock ballots filled out and mailed back by readers. However, the early surveys used “random” survey methods that were not very scientific, and their results were not very accurate.

1936 and 1948 were the two most important years in the history of public opinion polls.

In 1936, during the U.S. presidential election, the *Literary Digest* magazine distributed 10 million mock ballots based on telephone directories and car registrations. After analyzing the 2 million returned ballots, it incorrectly predicted that Landon would win the election. The Gallup Poll organization, by paying attention to selecting people of different ages, educational levels, genders, socioeconomic status, places of residence, and religious beliefs, and conducting quota sampling based on the proportion of each type of person in the national population, accurately predicted Roosevelt's victory despite surveying only 25,000 people. In the 1948 presidential election, Gallup and other public opinion poll organizations repeated the failure of the *Literary Digest*: contrary to the results of multiple mock voting surveys, Truman was elected president. After being publicly ridiculed by Truman and the press, the public opinion poll industry seriously examined the defects in their survey methods, abandoning the quota sampling method used for many years and replacing it with the more scientific probability sampling survey method.

After World War II, Hungary and Czechoslovakia were the first to establish public opinion poll institutions in socialist countries, surveying and studying citizens' views on election issues and domestic and international political and economic issues. Due to political reasons, public opinion polls in socialist countries have been intermittent. In the 1980s, public opinion polls in the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries saw significant development. Various public opinion poll institutions often conducted surveys on economic reforms, prices, wages, and evaluations of government leaders.

Facing similar problems to the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, the development of China's public opinion poll industry depends on whether it can break through political, cultural, and social constraints: in recent years, there have been instances of criticizing public opinion polls as “bourgeois” and even preventing newspapers from publishing public opinion poll results; the public initially placed high hopes on public opinion polls, but later found them useless. From the perspective of public opinion polls themselves, in the “survey fever” that arose in 1986, survey institutions and projects that do not adhere to scientific standards and professional ethics still exist. More importantly, the ultimate development and perfection of China's public opinion poll industry still depend on two prerequisites: acknowledging and respecting citizens' personal value and political rights; and news freedom becoming a reality and being protected by law.

### 民意何处寻？——谈谈民意调查

　　民意何处寻？  
    ——谈谈民意调查
    白桦
    一百多年前，美国总统林肯曾发问道：“我的愿望是按照人民的意愿办事，但问题是如何才能知道人民的真正意愿呢？”如今，人们终于找到了一种方法——民意调查。
    民意调查通过抽样选取一定数量的调查对象，询问他们对一些重大问题的态度与意见来推断社会舆论动向。在现代社会中，这一方法能为政府决策部门提供有关公众意愿的信息，也是学术机构、工商企业获取人们心理与行为过程信息的有效工具。
    近年来，民意调查正在成为中国公众越来越关注的“热点”，各种调查也层出不穷。实际上，民意调查引入我国的时间并不长，可以说，７０年代末才出现了雏形，当时一些报纸在工人中进行对重大社会政治问题看法的调查，中国农村发展问题研究组在农民中进行了有关贫富问题的心理反映调查等。
    １９８２年，我国出现了真正意义上的民意调查。这年夏天，首都新闻学会组织进行了“北京市读者、听众、观众调查”。这一调查从问卷设计、抽样方法、调查实施到数据处理，都采用国际民意调查的规范与方法。１９８５年以来，中国社会调查系统及其前身中国经济体制改革研究所社会室相继进行了物价改革、社会保障制度改革、政治体制改革的社会心理反应等调查，将民意调查方法引入改革决策研究。中国民意调查中心在开展改革中的社情民意调查的同时，还为学术研究和市场调查提供数据与信息，完成了多项意义重大的民意调查。
    追溯一下民意调查的发展历史，我们可以发现，民意调查最初产生时所扮演的角色与当今它在世界政治、经济和文化生活中所起的作用已大不相同。当时，在报纸的激烈竞争中，编辑记者们为招徕读者绞尽脑汁，从而搞起了总统竞选前公民投票意向调查（又称模拟投票）。报社或杂志社根据在街头、路边对过往行人的调查或读者填写寄回的模拟选票预测总统竞选结果。但是这些早期调查使用的“随意”调查方法很不科学，其结果也不够准确。
    １９３６年和１９４８年是民意调查史上最重要的两个年份。
    １９３６年美国总统竞选期间，《文学文摘》杂志根据电话号码簿和汽车登记册发放了１０００万张模拟选票，在对收回的２００万张选票进行分析后，错误地预测兰登将取得竞选胜利。盖洛普民意调查机构由于注意选择年龄、文化程度、性别、社会经济地位、居住地和宗教信仰各不相同的人，并根据每一类人在全国总人口中的比例进行配额抽样，尽管只调查了２．５万人，却准确预测了罗斯福当选。１９４８年总统大选，盖洛普以及其他民意调查机构却重演了当年《文学文摘》失败的一幕：与多次模拟投票调查的结果相反，杜鲁门当选为该届总统。在受到杜鲁门及新闻界的公开嘲笑后，民意调查界认真检讨调查方法上的缺陷，摒弃使用多年的配额抽样方法，代之以更为科学的概率抽样调查方法。
    第二次世界大战后，匈牙利和捷克在社会主义国家中率先成立了民意调查机构，调查和研究公民对选举问题、对国内外政治经济问题的看法。由于政治原因，社会主义国家的民意调查一直时断时续。进入８０年代，苏联与东欧各国的民意调查有了长足的发展。各民意调查机构经常针对经济改革、物价、工资和对政府领导人的评价等进行调查。
    与苏联和东欧国家面临的问题相同，中国民意调查事业的发展取决于能否走出政治的、文化的和社会的困境：几年来，指责民意调查是“资产阶级的那一套”，甚至阻止报刊登载民意调查结果的现象时有发生；公众对民意调查始而寄予厚望，继而怨之无用。从民意调查自身角度省察，１９８６年兴起的鱼龙混杂的“调查热”中，不遵守科学规范和职业道德的调查机构与调查项目依然存在。更为重要的是，中国民意调查事业的最终发展与完善，仍需以以下两点为前提，即：承认并尊重公民的个人价值和政治权利；新闻自由成为事实并受到法律的保护。
