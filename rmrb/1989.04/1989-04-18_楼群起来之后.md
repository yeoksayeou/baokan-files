After the construction of the residential complex

The first residential area in Nanping, Chongqing, which is currently under development, was jointly built by seven units, consisting of 12 buildings. It was completed in 1985 and now houses over 2,000 people. However, a planned 1,800 square meter public green space was not realized due to lack of funding and was later leveled by a municipal unit to be used as a materials storage and parking area. Since then, the environment of the residential area has been in disarray. According to a deputy district mayor of Nanshan District responsible for urban construction, this is because the first residential area was not promptly handed over to Nanshan District for management after completion. The subsequently built second residential area, which was promptly handed over to the district for management, has a beautiful environment that is pleasing to the eye.

It is understood that the per capita public green space in Chongqing is only 0.7 square meters, and the urban green coverage rate is only 15%. Why is this the case? One can perhaps find the answer in this photograph!

　　楼群起来之后
    重庆市正在开发的南坪第一住宅区，由7个单位共同修建了12幢楼房，于1985年交付使用，现已住进2000多口人。可是规划中的一块1800平方米的公共绿地，因为经费无着落没有实现绿化，后被一个市级单位平整后作为建材库和停车场。楼区环境从此杂乱不堪。据南岸区分管城建工作的一位副区长说，这是因为第一住宅区建成后未及时交给南岸区管理的缘故。后建的第二住宅区由于及时交给了区里管理，楼区环境优美，令人赏心悦目。
    据了解，重庆市人均公共绿化面积只有0.7平方米，城市绿化覆盖面只有15％。何至如此，不妨从这张照片上找找原因！
