The United Nations Secretary-General announced that the foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq will resume direct talks under his chairmanship in Geneva on April 20.

Our reporter, Li Kai Chen, reports from the United Nations on April 13: The United Nations Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar announced today that the foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq will begin a new round of direct talks in Geneva on April 20 under his chairmanship.

This agreement was reached after more than a month of consultations between UN representatives and representatives from both countries in New York. Since the ceasefire between Iran and Iraq began on August 20 last year, three rounds of ministerial-level direct talks have been held in Geneva and New York, but due to differences on a series of issues, the talks were suspended, and the peace process was hindered.

De Cuellar's statement today pointed out that the new round of talks provides an important opportunity to fully and swiftly implement Security Council Resolution 598, achieve good-neighborly relations, and lasting peace between the two countries. He hopes that both countries will adopt an urgent, determined, and benevolent attitude.

De Cuellar emphasized that Iran and Iraq need to withdraw their troops to internationally recognized borders without delay; release and repatriate prisoners of war; and begin consultations as soon as possible to reach a comprehensive, fair, and honorable solution to all outstanding issues based on the UN Charter, so that the economic life of both countries can quickly return to normal.

De Cuellar finally called on both countries to exercise restraint as they prepare for the upcoming direct talks and to create a suitable atmosphere for the talks.

　　联合国秘书长宣布
　　两伊下周恢复直接谈判
    本报联合国４月１３日电　本报记者刘开宸报道：联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔今天在这里宣布，伊朗和伊拉克外长将在秘书长主持下，于４月２０日在日内瓦开始新的一轮直接会谈。
    这是联合国代表与两伊代表在纽约分别磋商１个多月后达成的协议。两伊自去年８月２０日开始停火后，在日内瓦和纽约举行过三轮外长级直接会谈，但由于双方在一系列问题上意见分歧，会谈中断，和平进程受阻。
    德奎利亚尔今天发表的声明指出，新的一轮会谈为朝向全面迅速执行安理会５９８号决议、实现两国间的睦邻关系和持久和平，提供了重要机会，他希望两国采取急迫、有决心和善意的态度。
    德奎利亚尔强调，两伊需要毫不迟延地把军队撤到国际承认的边界线内；释放和遣返战俘；尽快开始协商，根据联合国宪章就所有悬而未决的问题达成全面、公正和体面的解决，使两国的经济生活迅速恢复正常。
    德奎利亚尔最后呼吁两国在即将举行直接会谈之际尽力克制，为会谈创造合适的气氛。
