Feed shortages and price surges are the primary factors affecting pig and poultry production. Last year, some provinces and regions experienced grain shortages, reducing the overall supply of feed. Additionally, restrictions on inter-provincial and regional feed circulation and variety adjustments exacerbated the supply-demand imbalance. In 10 provinces and cities, feed prices have risen by more than 50% compared to the same period last year. According to a sample survey in February, the main raw materials for feed in Jiangsu and Shandong provinces increased by 65.9% and 81.7% respectively compared to the same period last year, while the average purchase prices for pigs and poultry only increased by 20%. In Sichuan and Hunan provinces, the purchase prices for meat pigs decreased by 30% and 18.2% respectively. The sharp decline in the meat-to-feed price ratio has dampened farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs, with some areas prematurely slaughtering sows and reducing the number of pigs in stock. According to statistics from the commercial sector, the national pork sales volume in January and February this year decreased by 19.7% compared to the same period last year. The situation of "early slaughter on one side and reduced sales on the other" has led to a general increase in pork inventory in various places, which may result in difficulties in selling pigs during the peak slaughter season in May and June.

The impact of feed price increases on egg production is even more pronounced. Many places have closed hatcheries, and spring hatching is not vigorous. Many farmers and units that were planning to raise chicks have terminated their chick purchase contracts. Some places have seen the phenomenon of selling breeding eggs and chicks as table eggs and meat chickens. It is estimated that the total number of chickens raised will decrease by one-third. Experts analyze that in the previous period, some large and medium-sized cities emphasized raising the self-sufficiency rate of poultry and eggs, leading to some overheating in poultry and egg production, which should be appropriately cooled down, but attention should be paid to preventing drastic fluctuations.

Due to good market prices, smooth sales channels, and no constraints from grain production, grass-fed livestock (excluding dairy cows) in various places continue to maintain a good momentum of continuous development.

The problems in pig and poultry production have attracted widespread attention. The Ministry of Agriculture suggests improving the production environment of animal husbandry from five aspects: stabilizing pig-raising preferential policies, improving feed supply, unblocking pork sales channels, strengthening feed quality monitoring, and promoting scientific feeding techniques.

　　饲料涨价猪禽蛋减产  库存足近期市场可保
    食草家畜继续稳定增长
    本报北京４月３日讯  记者吴长生报道：生猪生产趋于下降，禽蛋减产已成定局，食草家畜继续稳步增长。这是农业部对１０个省市当前畜牧业生产情况调查后作出的分析。农业部同时指出，由于肉、蛋库存充足，近期不会影响市场。
    饲料紧缺、价格暴涨，是影响猪、禽生产的最主要原因。去年，部分省、区粮食减产，减少了饲料的总供给量；而后由于省、地区之间饲料流通和品种调剂受到限制，加剧了饲料供需矛盾。１０省市饲料价格比去年同期上涨５０％以上。据今年２月抽样调查，江苏、山东的饲料主要生产原料比去年同期分别上涨６５．９％、８１．７％，而猪、禽收购价平均提高仅为２０％。四川、湖南两省的肉猪收购价还分别下降了３０％和１８．２％。肉料比价的急剧下降，挫伤了农民养猪的积极性，一些地方提前出栏肉猪、宰杀母猪，使生猪存栏头数普遍趋减。另据商业部门统计，今年一二月份，全国猪肉销量比去年同期减少１９．７％。一边提前出栏，一边销售下降，“两头挤”的形势使各地普遍出现了猪肉涨库现象。这可能导致五六月生猪出栏小旺季出现“卖猪难”。
    饲料涨价对禽蛋生产的冲击更为突出。不少地方孵坊关门，春孵不旺，许多原准备进雏养鸡的农户、单位，中止了进雏合同。有些地方出现了种蛋、种鸡当作菜蛋、肉鸡出售的现象。估计养鸡总数要下降１／３。专家们分析，前一段由于一些大中城市片面强调提高禽蛋自给率，禽蛋生产有些过热，应当适当降降温，但应注意防止大起大落。
    由于市场价格好，销路通畅，又不受粮食生产的制约，各地食草家畜（除奶牛）仍保持继续发展的好势头。
    猪、禽生产中出现的问题，已引起各地的普遍重视。农业部建议从稳定养猪优惠政策、改善饲料供应、疏通猪肉销售渠道、加强饲料质量监测和推广科学饲养技术五方面，改善畜牧业生产环境。
