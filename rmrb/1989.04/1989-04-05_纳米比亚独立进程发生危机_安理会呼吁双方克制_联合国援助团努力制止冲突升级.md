The process of Namibia's independence has encountered a crisis. The Security Council has called on both sides to exercise restraint. The United Nations assistance team is working to prevent the escalation of conflicts.

	BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) — The President of the Security Council for this month, Alexander Belonogov, issued a statement this afternoon, calling on South Africa and the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) to exercise maximum restraint to avoid armed conflicts.

	The statement was issued after a Security Council consultation meeting.

	During the Security Council consultation meeting, UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar gave a "temporary report" on the recent armed conflicts in northern Namibia, but the contents of the report were not disclosed to the media.

	Belonogov emphasized the seriousness of the conflict in his statement and called on the conflicting parties to strictly adhere to the relevant agreements for resolving the Namibia issue in the interests of Namibia's independence.

	The statement concluded by emphasizing that the Security Council's Resolution 435 on Namibia's independence is in the interests of all the people of Namibia, and the member states of the Security Council are determined to ensure its smooth implementation.

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Windhoek, April 3 (Reporter Xiong Zhong Qi), the spokesman for the United Nations Transition Assistance Group said at a press conference held here today that the implementation of the Security Council's Resolution 435 on Namibia's independence is still underway. The goal of the assistance group is to immediately stop the escalation of conflicts in northern Namibia and prevent further bloodshed.

	He said that in addition to the personnel already stationed in Namibia, the rest of the personnel will arrive as scheduled.

	The assistance group consists of 4,650 soldiers, 500 police officers, and more than 1,000 civilian officials. So far, only about 1,000 soldiers from 21 countries, approximately 100 civilian personnel, and 9 police officers have arrived here.

	According to reports, on April 1, when the Security Council's Resolution 435 on Namibia's independence came into effect, armed conflicts broke out between SWAPO and the South African-established South West Africa (Namibia) Police in the northern regions. Since then, both sides have been intermittently exchanging fire. Local police officials confirmed that at least 142 people have died, including 122 from SWAPO and 20 from the South West Africa Police. South Africa and the South West Africa People's Organization have accused each other of firing first.

	The spokesman also said that the Secretary-General's Special Representative, Martti Ahtisaari, is "reporting the latest developments in Namibia to the Secretary-General," who will then "report to the Security Council. Emergency consultations may be held later today."

	He also said at the press conference that the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, Marrack Goulding, will arrive in Luanda, the capital of Angola, tomorrow to consult with Angolan officials on the "situation in Namibia."

	According to the Security Council's Resolution 435 on Namibia's independence, once the resolution comes into effect, the activities of South African forces and SWAPO will be restricted to their respective bases. Currently, due to the conflict between the two sides, some South African soldiers are leaving their bases to reinforce the South West Africa Police.

　　纳米比亚独立进程发生危机
    安理会呼吁双方克制
    联合国援助团努力制止冲突升级
    本报联合国４月３日电  记者刘开宸报道：联合国安理会本月份主席亚历山大·别洛诺戈夫今天下午发表一项声明，呼吁南非和西南非人民组织采取最大克制态度，避免武装冲突。
    这项声明是在安理会磋商会后发表的。
    在安理会磋商会上，联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔就纳米比亚北部最近发生的武装冲突事件作了“暂时性的报告”，但报告内容未向新闻界透露。
    别洛诺戈夫在声明中强调冲突事件的严重性，并呼吁冲突双方为了纳米比亚独立的利益严格遵守解决纳米比亚问题的有关协定。
    声明最后强调，联合国安理会关于纳米比亚独立的４３５号决议是符合纳米比亚全体人民的利益的，安理会成员国决心使该决议顺利得到贯彻。
    据新华社温得和克４月３日电　（记者熊仲琪）联合国过渡时期援助团发言人今天在这里举行的记者招待会上说，联合国安理会关于纳米比亚独立的４３５号决议的实施仍在进行，援助团的目标是立即制止在纳米比亚北部冲突的升级，避免进一步的流血事件。
    他说，援助团除了已进驻纳米比亚的人员外，其余的人员将按期到达这里。
    援助团由４６５０名士兵、５００名警察和１０００多名文官组成。到目前为止，只有大约１０００名来自２１个国家的士兵，约１００名文职人员和９名警官到达了这里。
    据报道，４月１日当联合国安理会关于纳米比亚独立的４３５号决议宣布生效时，在纳北部地区发生了西南非人民组织和南非建立的西南非（纳米比亚）警察间的武装冲突。从此，双方交火在间歇地进行。据这里的警方人士证实，至少有１４２人死亡，其中西南非人民组织的伤亡人数为１２２人，西南非警察有２０人死亡。南非和西南非洲人民组织互相指责对方首先开火。
    这位发言人还说，联合国秘书长的特别代表马尔蒂·阿赫蒂萨里“正在向秘书长汇报纳米比亚最新事态发展”，然后“秘书长再向安理会报告，今天晚些时候可能进行紧急磋商”。
    他在记者招待会上还说，负责联合国维持和平部队的联合国副秘书长马拉克·戈尔丁明日将抵达安哥拉首都罗安达，与安哥拉官员磋商“纳米比亚的形势”。
    按照联合国安理会关于纳米比亚独立的４３５号决议，一旦决议生效，南非部队和西南非人民组织的活动范围将被限制在各方的基地内。目前由于双方发生冲突，南非军队一些士兵正离开他们的基地向西南非警察增援。
