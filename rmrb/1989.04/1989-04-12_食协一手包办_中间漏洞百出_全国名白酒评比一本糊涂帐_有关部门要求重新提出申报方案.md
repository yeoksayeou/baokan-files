The fifth national white liquor evaluation, organized by the China Food Association, was held in Hefei in January. The evaluation included 362 (or 374) types of white liquor, more than 200 types than the previous evaluation. During the evaluation, it was revealed that the activities outside the meeting were more lively than those inside. Later, it was discovered that several dozen types of white liquor were using other people's trademarks and falsely claiming to be famous brands.

Bo Dongshan, director of the Quality Management Department of the State Bureau of Technical Supervision, said that the application plan submitted by the China Food Association was a mess. The opinions of the supervising departments and expert groups were not consistent, and the participating enterprises frequently complained. The State Bureau of Technical Supervision reviewed the original records of this evaluation and found numerous loopholes. Preliminary investigation revealed that this evaluation had five major issues.

First, the leadership of the evaluation was not implemented. Before the evaluation meeting, relevant departments of the State Council had clearly instructed that a joint leadership group should be formed by the China Food Association, the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Commerce, and the Ministry of Agriculture. In reality, no joint leadership group was established, and the China Food Association basically managed everything alone.

Second, the evaluation standards were not strictly followed. Before the meeting, several relevant departments had jointly issued a document specifying the index coefficients for various components of white liquor. Later, the China Food Association unilaterally notified a few enterprises that they could exceed the indices.

Third, the evaluation procedures were not strict. Initially, the evaluation decided to implement an elimination system with preliminary, semi-final, and final rounds. However, after the semi-finals, the China Food Association unilaterally selected some eliminated white liquors to enter the finals with the winners.

Fourth, the management of trademarks and the opinions of consumers were ignored. Before the meeting, it was agreed that the China Consumer Association would represent the Administration for Industry and Commerce to score the appearance of the participating white liquors, including shape, appearance, trademarks, and whether they leaked. However, the China Food Association arbitrarily canceled this agreement. It has been found that 28 types of participating white liquors were using other people's registered trademarks, 23 types of white liquor trademarks violated relevant regulations for liquor trademark management, and more than 20 types of white liquors falsely claimed to be famous brands.

Fifth, the types of white liquor aromas were arbitrarily determined. Traditional Chinese white liquor has four types of aromas: strong, light, sauce, and rice. This evaluation arbitrarily decided to add two more types: special aroma and sesame aroma. It is known that the production of these two types of aromas is limited, the output is low, they lack representativeness, and there is no consumer base, making it difficult for them to form independently.

It is understood that the Quality Management Department of the State Bureau of Technical Supervision, which is responsible for the certification and issuance of the national white liquor evaluation, has instructed the China Food Association to respect expert opinions, rely on testing data, and solve the remaining issues. They are required to resubmit the application plan to expedite the announcement of the evaluation results.

### 食协一手包办　中间漏洞百出　全国名白酒评比一本糊涂帐　有关部门要求重新提出申报方案

　　食协一手包办　中间漏洞百出
　　全国名白酒评比一本糊涂帐
　　有关部门要求重新提出申报方案
    据新华社北京４月１１日电　（记者杨理科）“评比三个月，一笔糊涂帐”。这是国家技术监督局有关负责人对第五届全国名白酒评比的看法。
    由中国食品协会主办的这届名白酒评比是今年１月在合肥市举行的。参加评比的白酒达３６２种（又说３７４种），比第四届参评白酒多出２００多种。评比会议期间就曾爆出会下“活动”远比会上热闹的“新闻”；尔后又冒出奇事，几十种白酒擅用他人商标和冒用名优称号。
    国家技术监督局质量管理司司长董述山介绍说，中国食品协会送来的申报方案实际上是一本糊涂帐，主管部门和专家组的意见很不一致，参评企业也不断告状。国家技术监督局调阅这次评比的原始记录，发现其中漏洞百出。经初步调查，认为这次评比存在５个方面的问题。
    一是评比领导工作不落实。国务院有关部门在评比会召开前，曾明确指示要由中国食协、轻工部、商业部、农业部等单位联合组成领导小组。实际上并没有成立联合领导小组，而基本上是由中国食协一手包办。
    二是没有严格执行评酒标准。会前几个有关部门曾联合发文，具体规定了白酒各种成份的指标系数，后来中国食品协会却又擅自通知少数企业可以突破指标。
    三是评比程序不严密。这次评比原先决定实行初赛、复赛、半决赛、决赛的淘汰制，但进行半决赛之后，中国食品协会又擅自从被淘汰白酒中挑选出部分白酒与优胜者一起进入决赛。
    四是无视商标管理和消费者的意见。会前协议由中国消费者协会代表工商行政管理局对参评白酒的外观，包括造型、外观、商标、是否漏酒等打分，而最后中国食协却武断地取消了这一协议。现已查出，参评白酒中有２８种擅用他人注册商标，２３种白酒的商标违反了酒类商标管理的有关规定，还有２０多种白酒冒用名优称号。
    五是随意确定白酒香型。中国白酒传统香型有４种，即浓、清、酱、米４种香型。这次评比他们却又随意决定增加特香和芝麻香两种香型。据告知，这两种香型生产厂家少，产量很低，缺乏代表性，又没有消费基础，确实难以独立成型。
    据了解，负责这次名白酒评比认证和发牌工作的国家技术监督局质量管理司，已责成中国食协在尊重专家意见、依靠检测数据、解决好遗留问题的基础上，重新提出申报方案，以便尽快公布评比结果。
