Title: On What "Framework" Will "Flesh" Be Added?

King Hussein of Jordan was the third Middle Eastern leader to visit the White House recently. Hussein's visit to the U.S. marked the first round of the Bush administration's efforts to address the Middle East issue.

After the previous two visitors, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, held talks with President Bush, the general outline of Middle East affairs became clear:

Egypt advocates for the early convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East, hosted by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. The principles for politically resolving Middle East disputes are UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, and "land for peace." Direct talks between Israelis and Palestinians can be held within the framework of the international conference.

Israel advocates for "free elections" in the occupied territories. Afterward, the Israeli government will negotiate with representatives elected by the Palestinians, with the "maximum limit" being allowing Palestinians to exercise "autonomy" in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. On issues such as the international conference, direct dialogue with the PLO, and international supervision of elections, Israel's stance is a simple "no."

The United States advocates for "holding an appropriately structured international conference at an appropriate time" and "ending Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip." However, it also conditionally accepts the "framework" of Shamir's election proposal, hoping to "add flesh to this framework" to create a plan acceptable to both Arabs and Israelis.

Before King Hussein's visit to the United States, he met again with President Mubarak and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat to coordinate their positions. Generally, it is estimated that his stance will not differ substantially from that of Egypt and the PLO. Arab public opinion analyzes that Hussein's visit to the U.S. has "almost no chance of causing a surprise."

In the face of the still-distant positions of the Arab-Israeli dispute, people naturally shift their focus to the host of the chain of talks, the United States. Some commentators say that the Bush administration "now has two faces," playing favorites. To the Arabs, the U.S. emphasizes "ending the occupation"; in front of Israel, the U.S. nods and says "agree to elections."

However, according to some Arab countries and U.S. media analyses, seeking to "add flesh to the election framework" seems to be the plan the Bush administration is currently preparing to explore.

Recently, reporters have relentlessly pursued this issue with the PLO. Chairman Arafat made his position clear: elections can be held, but first, Israeli troops must withdraw from the occupied territories, and second, there must be international supervision. This is entirely reasonable. Who can believe that elections under the threat of guns will be "free and democratic"? In contrast to this flexible attitude, Israel, which proposed the election plan, flatly rejects international supervision.

The White House still wants to try. According to U.S. media reports, the compromise is: Israeli troops partially withdraw from important cities in the West Bank and Gaza; "free elections" are held under the supervision of the U.S., the Soviet Union, and Egypt; the negotiations on the "final status" of the West Bank and Gaza can include members of the PLO, and under the "written guarantee" of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, ultimately leading to "national self-determination for Palestinians within a federation with Jordan."

This unconfirmed great power negotiating card is nothing new in the Middle East. To say nothing else, can "international supervision" pass through the hands of that unruly old friend of the U.S., Shamir? White House officials themselves are not sure. The Los Angeles Times recently published an article by an Israeli reporter stating that "indirect talks between Israel and the PLO, mediated by the U.S., have begun." This may be the truth, despite the Israeli authorities' denials.

Whether flesh can be added to the election framework remains to be seen, depending on the courage and price this mediator is willing to pay.

### 在什么“骨架”上“长肉”？

　　在什么“骨架”上“长肉”？
    本报记者　林皎明
    约旦国王侯赛因是美国白宫近期接待的第３位中东来客。侯赛因访美也是布什政府着手处理中东问题第一回合的尾音。
    在前两位客人，即埃及总统穆巴拉克和以色列总理沙米尔，分别与布什总统会谈后，中东时事经纬有了粗线条的轮廓：
    埃及主张尽快召开由联合国安理会５个常任理事国主持的中东和平国际会议；政治解决中东争端的原则是安理会２４２、３３８号决议和“以土地换取和平”等；可以在国际和会框架内首先举行巴以直接会谈。
    以色列主张，在被占领土举行“自由选举”。之后，由以色列政府与巴勒斯坦人选举产生的代表谈判，谈判结果的“最大极限”是允许巴勒斯坦人在西岸和加沙地带实行“自治”。在国际和会、与巴解组织直接对话、国际监督选举等问题上，以色列的态度只是一个“不”字。
    美国主张“在合适的时机，召开适当结构的国际会议”，“结束以色列对约旦河西岸和加沙地区的占领”，但同时，也有条件地接受沙米尔选举方案的“骨架”，希望“在这个骨架上长肉”，使之成为一份阿以双方都能接受的方案。
    侯赛因国王出访美国前，再次与穆巴拉克总统、阿拉法特主席会晤以协调立场。一般估计，他的态度不会与埃及、巴解组织的立场有本质的不同。阿拉伯舆论分析，侯赛因访美“爆冷门的可能性微乎其微”。
    在阿以争端双方的立场仍然相去甚远的形势下，人们自然把关注的焦点转移到连锁会谈东道主美国的身上。有的评论说，布什政府“现在有两副面孔”，看人下菜碟。对阿拉伯人，美国偏重说“结束占领”；当着以色列的面，美国又点头说“同意选举”。
    然而，据一些阿拉伯国家和美国报刊舆论分析，争取在选举方案的“骨架上长肉”，看来是布什政府眼下准备试探的方案。
    近来，新闻记者穷追不舍地就此探询巴解组织。阿拉法特主席把话说得相当明确，选举是可以举行的，但一要以色列军队撤出被占领土，二要有国际监督。这完全合情合理。谁能相信枪口威逼下的选举会是“自由、民主的”？与此灵活态度相反，提出选举方案的以色列断然拒绝国际监督。
    白宫还是有人想试试。据美国报刊披露，折衷的办法是：以色列军队部分地从西岸和加沙重要城镇撤出；在美苏两国和埃及监督下进行“自由选举”；西岸和加沙地带“最终地位”的谈判可以包括巴解组织成员，在美苏“书面保证”下，最后导致“巴勒斯坦人在与约旦结成邦联的国家内的民族自决”。
    这种未经证实的大国谈判底牌，在中东屡见不鲜。别的都不说，“国际监督”能在美国那位不听话的老朋友沙米尔手上过关吗？白宫官员自己也说不清。美国《洛杉矶时报》前不久刊登一位以色列报人的文章说，由美国做中间人的“以色列与巴解组织的间接谈判已经开始”。这可能是实情，尽管以色列当局矢口否认。
    选举骨架上究竟能不能长出肉来，且看这位中间人的胆识和肯出的价码。
