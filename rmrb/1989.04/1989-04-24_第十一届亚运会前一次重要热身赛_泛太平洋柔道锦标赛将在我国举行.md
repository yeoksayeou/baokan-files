The sixth Pan-Pacific Judo Championship will be held in Beijing from May 13th to 14th. This is an important warm-up match before the 11th Asian Games, and Asian countries and regions are paying great attention to it.

Countries and regions participating in this competition include Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia, New Zealand, Australia, the United States, the Philippines, Chinese Taipei, and the host country China's A and B teams, with over 100 athletes in total.

This competition features a high level of play. China's A and B teams will have renowned athletes such as Gao Fenglian, Li Zhongyun, and Zhuang Xiaoyan participating. Japan will have Haneda Olympic Games demonstration match women's 72 kg third-place winner Yoko Tanabe; South Korea will have Jeong Seon-yeong and Kim Mi-jung, among others.

Since China began promoting judo in 1979, the sport has developed rapidly nationwide, with significant improvements in technical levels. In major international competitions, including the Olympics, China has achieved some good results, particularly in women's judo, where gold medals have been won in world championships and Olympic demonstration matches. However, men's judo still lags behind Japan and South Korea in technical levels. This competition will be an excellent opportunity for training and learning.

　　第十一届亚运会前一次重要热身赛     
    泛太平洋柔道锦标赛将在我国举行
    本报北京４月２４日讯  记者黄振中报道：据中国柔道协会介绍，第六届泛太平洋柔道锦标赛将于５月１３日至１４日在北京举行。这是第十一届亚运会前的重要热身赛，亚洲国家和地区都很重视。
    参加这次比赛的有日本、南朝鲜、香港、澳门、马来西亚、新西兰、澳大利亚、美国、菲律宾、中国台北和东道主中国Ａ、Ｂ两队，共１００多名选手。
    本次比赛水平高，中国Ａ、Ｂ两队参赛的有高凤莲、李忠云和庄晓严等名将。日本有汉城奥运会表演赛女子７２公斤级第３名田边洋子；南朝鲜的郑善榕和金美中等。
    我国自１９７９年开展柔道运动以来，在全国发展很快，运动技术水平也有较快提高，在参加奥运会和重大的国际比赛中，取得一些好成绩，尤其是女子柔道，在世界锦标赛和奥运会表演赛中都取得过金牌。但男子柔道技术水平与日本、南朝鲜比还有一段差距，本届比赛，将是一个很好的锻炼和学习机会。
