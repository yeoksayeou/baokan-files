West Germany's Foreign Minister Genscher and Defense Minister Stoltenberg, who are visiting the United States, met today with U.S. Secretary of State Baker, Defense Secretary Cheney, and National Security Advisor Scowcroft. The two sides failed to resolve their differences over short-range missiles and other issues.

Baker said after the meeting that both sides have a better understanding of each other's positions and will continue discussions to reach an agreement among the allies. A State Department spokesman said that the U.S. believes it is wrong for East and West to hold arms control talks on short-range missiles.

President Bush said today en route to Chicago that he told West German Chancellor Kohl over the weekend that West Germany should not unilaterally create any facts on the short-range missile issue.

Under pressure from the West German public, the Kohl government decided last week to urge the United States to postpone the deployment of a new generation of Lance short-range missiles in West Germany and to seek NATO approval at the upcoming summit in Brussels for U.S.-Soviet talks on reducing short-range missiles in Europe.

U.S. Defense Secretary Cheney today clearly stated his opposition to the Federal Republic of Germany's proposal for early talks between the United States and the Soviet Union on reducing short-range nuclear weapons deployed in Europe. He said that if the United States starts such talks now, "the consequences would be very dangerous."

Cheney said today in an interview with the National Broadcasting Company that nuclear weapons have been the main means for the West to counterbalance the Soviet Union's absolute advantage in conventional weapons in Europe over the past 40 years. The Soviet Union has always demanded "denuclearization of Europe" and still regards it as its goal.

　　美西德对短导分歧依旧    
    美国反对与苏联举行短导谈判
    本报华盛顿４月２４日电  记者仓立德报道：前来美国访问的西德外长根舍、国防部长斯托尔滕贝格今天与美国国务卿贝克、国防部长切尼及国家安全事务助理斯考克罗夫特进行了会谈，双方在欧洲短程导弹等问题上未能弥合分歧。
    贝克在会谈后表示，双方更加了解了各自的立场，并将继续讨论，以便在盟国中达成协议。美国国务院发言人说，我们认为东西方就短导问题举行控制军备谈判是错误的。
    布什总统今天在飞往芝加哥途中说，他于上周末告诉西德总理科尔，西德不应该单方面在短导问题上造成任何既成事实。
    迫于西德公众压力，科尔政府上周决定敦促美国推迟在西德部署新一代长矛式短程导弹，并寻求北约在下月布鲁塞尔首脑会晤时批准美苏谈判在欧洲削减短导问题。
    新华社华盛顿４月２３日电　美国国防部长切尼今天明确表示，他反对联邦德国提出的美苏两国就削减部署在欧洲的短程核武器尽早举行谈判的建议。他说，如果美国现在就开始这类谈判，“后果将非常危险”。
    切尼今天在接受美国全国广播公司采访时说，核武器是西方在过去４０年中抗衡苏联在欧洲地区处于绝对优势的常规军备的主要手段，苏联一直要求“欧洲非核化”，而且至今仍把它作为自己的目标。
