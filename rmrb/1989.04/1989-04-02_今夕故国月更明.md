	Tonight the Moon Over the Homeland is Even Brighter
	Wáng Yīngqí

	The moon's soft glow spread out as my friend Xin Ye brought two more friends: one is Li Da Jie, the other is also Li Da Jie. "Come, let's go stroll through the night market," the three friends said with smiles.

	Stroll through the night market? I'm an expert at that. Beijing's, Nanjing's, Guangzhou's... As for Kaifeng's, I haven't been there, but I've read about it in books. I recall that when I was writing the screenplay for the movie "Li Qingzhao," I read "Dongjing Meng Hua Lu" so thoroughly that I practically wore it out. The two things that stuck with me the most were the night market in the old capital and the bustling festival outside the city on Qingming.

	Back then, the nights in Bianjing were so grand and magnificent. Brothels lined the streets, and merchants filled the markets. Countless beautiful women sang softly, and the sound of music and singing never stopped coming from the tents of the wealthy, where they indulged in wine and meat, oblivious to old age. During the Qingming festival, the outskirts of Bianjing were even more bustling, with officials and ladies filling the streets. There were those who came to pay respects, those who came to enjoy the spring, those who came to perform, and those who sold various snacks...

	The scene was truly as depicted in "Qingming Shanghe Tu," bustling with life!

	As the saying goes, "When things are at their peak, they begin to decline." In reality, behind the false prosperity of Bianjing at that time, there were already crises everywhere—the internal mechanisms of the Northern Song Dynasty were rotten from the inside out.

	Sure enough, not long after, it was destroyed by a small country from beyond the Great Wall, north of the Yinshan Mountains.

	They say: "The old country is too painful to recall." But today, as we stroll again through the old capital, it's hard to feel that "pain of Jingkang" and "grief of the fallen country."

	All we feel is surprise. Although history has risen and fallen for a thousand years, who would have thought that the prosperity of the old capital still remains? Those bustling crowds, the flickering lights, the various snacks... I just feel that my eyes aren't enough to see it all, my nose isn't enough to smell it all, and I want to take in everything with my eyes and eat it all with my stomach.

	They say: "Three women make a play." But we are four, so the play is even more lively. Xin Ye suggested having a late-night snack, and everyone enthusiastically agreed. The two plump Li Da Jies—one with glasses, one with a braid—kept exclaiming "fantastic" and "awesome," making everyone's mouths water, as if they wanted to grow three stomachs and six intestines to eat all the snacks here. The Li Da Jie with glasses picked up a chicken: "This is amazing, let's have a young rooster!" The Li Da Jie with glasses spent money with a bit of a manly air, and you couldn't find a trace of the impact of a recent "marital change" on her. She was the most carefree among women. After tasting the delicious young rooster from the Li Da Jie with glasses, the Li Da Jie with a braid ordered a portion of "sweet potato paste." At first, I was skeptical of this sweet potato paste. After all, Henan is famous for its sweet potatoes, so they must be fooling people with it, right? What could be so special about it?

	But after tasting it, I almost wanted to eat the plate too. The flavor was incredible.

	What interested me the most was that I could see southern pickled vegetables and preserved vegetables here. I ordered a few dishes, and they were refreshing and delicious, not inferior to those from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Yunnan, or Guizhou.

	The night sky was exceptionally beautiful. The moon hung in the middle of the sky, and silver light poured down. As we ate, a strange fragrance wafted over. I went to check and found that it was the scent of freshly roasted chestnuts. Xin Ye went to ask the price, and the answer was: 5 yuan per pound. The three friends all clicked their tongues in amazement. I, however, didn't think much of it. It's not often that I get to stroll through the night market in Kaifeng, and if I can't even afford to eat these chestnuts, it's like I can't afford to live. I insisted on treating everyone to chestnuts, but Xin Ye pulled me away to a stand selling sugar-coated pears: "Everyone has eaten chestnuts, but you haven't tried this. I'll treat you."

	I was really annoyed. I swore to the heavens that if I didn't get to treat everyone at least once, I would refuse all food. Everyone stopped being polite and obediently sat down, waiting for me to order four bowls of sugar-coated pears. The taste was really good, soft and tender, and even the soup was sweet and rich, very delicious. We ate two bowls before stopping.

	Quietly, we found that it was already deep into the night. Looking at the city of Kaifeng under the night sky, it was still full of energy, with lights and moon shining brightly. The cries of vendors rose and fell, and people bustled through the alleys and streets...

	I thought of the ancient capital of Bianliang a thousand years ago—if yesterday's Bianjing, with its golden palaces and singing and dancing, was a prelude to a national tragedy, then today's prosperity is a sign of national prosperity.

	The moon was slanted, and people were tired. The distant drumbeat sounded...

　　今夕故国月更明
　　王英琦
    溶溶月色漫开的时候，女友新叶又领来二位女友：一位是李大姐，另一位也是李大姐。“走，陪你逛夜市去。”三位女友笑盈盈地说。
    逛夜市？这个我太在行了。北京的、南京的、广州的……至于这开封的么，没逛过，却是在书里头见过。遥想当年，为了写电影剧本《李清照》，一本《东京梦华录》，硬是让我给翻了个稀巴烂。记忆最深处有二点：一是故国京城的夜市，一是清明郊外的民间盛会。
    那时节的汴京之夜，是何等的气派辉煌。秦楼楚馆栉次鳞比，行商坐贾充街盈市。数不清的名姝佳丽低吟浅唱，笙歌细乐之声不断从一群群“酒肉堆中不知老”的王谢子孙的“销金帐”中传出……每到清明之时，汴京郊外更是冠盖济济，仕女如云。有祭扫的，有踏青的，有卖艺的，有各种风味小吃的……
    那情景，诚如《清明上河图》所描绘的，兴盛极了！
    有道是，盛极必衰。实际上，当时汴京的一派假太平的背后，已是危机四伏——北宋王朝的内部机制从里到外整个儿地烂掉了。
    果然不久，它就被来自长城以外阴山以北的蕞尔小国给灭掉了。
    都云：故国不堪回首。而我们今天重又徜徉在这故国的都城，心中却很难再有那份“靖康之耻，亡国之恨”的感觉了。
    有的只是惊讶。按说历史已经浮浮沉沉地过去了千载，却不料昔日京都的繁华犹在。那憧憧人影，那灯火阑干，那五花八门的小吃……我只觉得眼不够瞅，鼻子不够嗅，好想把这一切都看到眼里，吃到肚子里去。
    人说：三个女人一台戏。而我们是四个，这戏就更热闹了。新叶提议吃夜宵，大家热烈拥护。二位胖嘟嘟的李大姐——一位“眼镜李”，一位“辫子李”，忽儿叫这个“精彩”，忽儿喊那个“棒极”，惹得人馋涎欲滴，恨不能生出三肠六胃，把这儿所有的小吃全吞下去。眼镜李大姐拎起一只鸡：“太棒了，来一只童子鸡！”眼镜李大姐花起钱来很有点男子气派，从她身上你找不到丁点儿刚遭“婚变”打击的痕迹，她是女人之中活的够洒脱的一个。刚品尝完眼镜李大姐味道绝伦的童子鸡，辫子李大姐又要了一份“红薯酱”。一开始，我对这红薯酱很是怀疑，敢情河南盛产红薯，便拿破红薯“懵人”，那能有个什么吃头？
    不想，尝了一口后，竟连盘子也恨不能生吞下去了。那味儿太绝了。
    最使我感兴趣的是这儿竟能看到南方的泡菜、腌菜，要了几碟，清爽可口，其味绝不在江浙云贵一带之下。
    今晚的夜色极好。月挂中天，银辉泻地。吃着吃着，一股奇香扑鼻，过去一看，原来是刚上市的糖炒栗子的香味。新叶上前去问价钱，答曰：５元１斤。三位女友听了齐咋舌。我却不以为然，好不容易逛一回开封夜市，连这栗子都舍不得吃，真像活不起似的。我执意要请大家吃栗子，新叶却死拉活拽把我拖到一个卖冰糖梨的小吃跟前：“栗子大家都吃过，这个你却没吃过，我来请客。”
    我真来气了。指天戳地发誓再不让我请一回客，我便拒绝一切吃的。
    大家不再谦让了，乖乖地坐下等我上了四碗冰糖梨。味道真不坏，又酥又烂，连汤都又甜又腻煞是好喝。我们连吃了两碗方才罢休。
    消消停停地，不觉已是夜深沉了。再看那夜幕幕中的开封城，竟还毫无乏意，仍是灯月交辉一片通明。叫卖声彼起此伏，人们竞相穿梭在巷闾街市之中……
    我又想到了１０００多年前的那个京都汴梁——如果说在昨天的那个金堆玉砌歌舞升平的汴京背后，酝酿着的是一场民族大悲剧的话，那么，今日这一派繁华则是预示着民族的昌盛。
    月儿斜了，人儿困了，远处的梆声响了……
