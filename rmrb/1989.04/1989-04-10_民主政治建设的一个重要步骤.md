The long-awaited "Administrative Litigation Law of the People's Republic of China" has been passed by the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress. This is a major event in the construction of socialist legal system in our country, and also an important step in the construction of socialist democratic politics. With this law, the legal rights of citizens and organizations can be effectively protected, and the administrative organs can be supervised and urged to exercise their powers according to law, thus promoting the construction of clean government in our country.

Our government is a government serving the people. However, the level and quality of our government officials vary, and it is difficult to completely avoid infringing upon the legal rights of citizens, legal persons, and other organizations when they perform their duties. In the past, when such incidents occurred, citizens, legal persons, and other organizations often placed their hopes on petitions.

Experience has shown that many problems cannot be solved merely through petitions. The effective way to protect the legal rights of citizens, legal persons, and other organizations and to promote the lawful administration of administrative organs is to formulate the Administrative Litigation Law and establish the administrative litigation system. Now that the Administrative Litigation Law has been promulgated, the common people can sue "officials," and the procedures for the people's courts to try administrative cases have become more perfect. When the legal rights of citizens, legal persons, and other organizations are harmed by administrative organs, they can be promptly remedied, and illegal administrative acts can be corrected.

In contemporary times, administrative litigation has been listed alongside criminal litigation and civil litigation as one of the three major types of litigation. Whether a country establishes an administrative litigation system is an important indicator of the level of democracy and rule of law in that country. The promulgation of the Administrative Litigation Law in our country is an important sign that our country is on the track of socialist rule of law. Our task is to turn the good legal provisions on paper into actions. This requires a lot of work. First, the judicial personnel of the people's courts must learn this law well and strictly enforce it. Now, the plaintiffs sitting in front of them are ordinary citizens and legal persons, while the defendants sitting in front of them are administrative chiefs of administrative organs. In front of such plaintiffs and defendants, the judges need courage to be upright and impartial, fearless of power, and handle cases according to law. The people expect the judges to always adhere to the principle of facts as the basis and law as the criterion when trying administrative cases. Secondly, whether the Administrative Litigation Law can be observed is closely related to whether the administrative organs and their personnel have a correct understanding of this law. This requires that all levels of state administrative organs organize their personnel to study this law, familiarize themselves with the regulations, grasp the spirit, overcome the erroneous idea that some cadres have of losing face by going to court with the common people, and eliminate the erroneous behavior of not appearing in court when summoned and not executing judgments. Of course, in administrative litigation, citizens and organizations acting as plaintiffs should not misunderstand that since they can sue administrative penalties given by administrative organs, they can sue indiscriminately and entangle in litigation. Such ideas and actions are wrong. All administrative disposal decisions that conform to legal provisions are necessary for good state management, and citizens and organizations should execute them seriously and not go to court to complain.

After the promulgation of the Administrative Litigation Law, various forms of propaganda should be carried out to make all cadres and the masses understand the significance of promulgating the Administrative Litigation Law and master the main contents of administrative litigation. This work should first be done by all levels of party committees and governments, the people's courts, and social opinion organizations. We believe that through the propaganda and implementation of the Administrative Litigation Law, we can accelerate the progress of democratic and legal construction in our country, effectively protect the legal rights of citizens, legal persons, and other organizations, and promote the lawful administration of administrative organs.

　　民主政治建设的一个重要步骤
    本报评论员
    我国人民盼望已久的《中华人民共和国行政诉讼法》，已由七届人大二次会议通过。这是我国社会主义法制建设的一件大事，也是我国社会主义民主政治建设的一个重要步骤。有了这个法，可以有效地保护公民和组织的合法权益，维护和监督行政机关依法行使职权，推进我国的廉政建设。
    我们的政府，是为人民服务的。但是，我们政府的工作人员，水平不一样，素质有高低，在执行职务的时候，很难完全避免发生侵犯公民、法人和其他组织合法权益的事。以前发生这类事，公民、法人和其他组织往往把希望寄托在上访上。
    经验表明，许多问题仅仅通过上访是无法解决的。保护公民、法人和其他组织的合法权益，促进行政机关依法行政的有效途径，是制定行政诉讼法，建立行政诉讼制度。现在，行政诉讼法颁布了，老百姓可以告“官”，法院审理行政案件的程序更加完善。公民、法人和其他组织的合法权益受到行政机关损害，可以及时得到补救，违法的行政行为，也可以得到纠正。
    在当代，行政诉讼已与刑事诉讼、民事诉讼并列为三大诉讼。一个国家是否建立行政诉讼制度，是衡量这个国家民主和法治发展水平的一个重要标志。我国行政诉讼法的颁布，则是我国走上社会主义法治轨道的重要标志。我们的任务，是要把纸面上的好的法律规定变为人们的行动。这就要做许多工作。首先是人民法院的审判人员要学好这个法，并严格执行这个法。现在，坐在他们面前的原告，是普通老百姓、法人，而坐在他们面前的被告，是行政机关的行政首长。在这样的原告和被告面前，法官们要做到刚直不阿，不畏权势，秉公办案，是需要勇气的。人民期望法官们在审判行政案件时，能始终坚持以事实为根据、以法律为准绳的原则。其次，行政诉讼法能否得到遵守，与行政机关及其工作人员对这个法的认识是否正确密切相关。这就要求各级国家行政机关认真组织自己的工作人员学习这个法，熟悉规定，掌握精神，克服在某些干部中存在的与老百姓对簿公堂有失身份的错误思想，杜绝传讯不到庭、判决不执行的错误行为。当然，在行政诉讼中作为原告的公民和组织，也不能由此产生误解，认为既然对行政机关给予的行政处罚不服的可以告状，便滥诉缠讼。这样的想法和做法是错误的。凡是符合法律规定的行政处理决定，都是搞好国家管理所必须的，公民和组织应认真执行，而不应当去法院投诉。
    行政诉讼法颁布以后，需要采取各种形式进行宣传，使广大干部和群众都认识颁布行政诉讼法的意义，都掌握行政诉讼的主要内容。这个工作，首先是各级党委和政府要做，人民法院要做，社会舆论机构也要做。我们相信，通过宣传和贯彻行政诉讼法，一定可以加速我国民主和法制建设的进程，有效地保护公民、法人和其他组织的合法权益，促进行政机关依法行政。
