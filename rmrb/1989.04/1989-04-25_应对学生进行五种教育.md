As a middle school teacher, I am particularly concerned with how to prevent students from developing the idea that "studying is useless" and instead help them understand that "studying is useful."

To achieve this, my view is:

Firstly, students should be educated on the honor of studying and the shame of ignorance. There are many stories of people who have worked hard to study and become successful, both in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. These stories can inspire students to study diligently. We can also tell students what the future world will be like, making them realize that it will be a world of scientific prosperity and abundant talent, thereby enhancing their sense of urgency to study and seek knowledge.

Secondly, help students understand the relationship between studying and personal development. Teachers should frequently instill in students the idea that "knowledge is the foundation of one's career." This will help students understand that in the 1990s, illiteracy or semi-illiteracy will not lead to success. Only by mastering rich knowledge and skills can one establish oneself in society and contribute to the country and the nation. This will inspire students' desire for progress and thirst for knowledge.

Thirdly, students should be educated to respect teachers and love their school. Through this education, students will feel that receiving education from "engineers of the human soul"—teachers, and studying in the "sacred hall"—the school, is a great happiness and pride. Once students develop this sense of superiority, they will happily and willingly engage in studying.

Fourthly, it is necessary to educate students on the value of knowledge. During this education, teachers should not exaggerate or emphasize the temporary devaluation of knowledge. Instead, they should explain the value of knowledge from a macro to micro perspective, from reality to the future, making students feel that knowledge is indeed useful and that without knowledge, one cannot succeed. In this way, students will naturally see studying as an important means of acquiring knowledge and will not look down on studying.

Fifthly, students should be educated on the importance of complying with the Compulsory Education Law, making them truly understand the spirit of the law and recognize that receiving education, learning knowledge, and culture is a responsibility and obligation to the country and the nation. Any thoughts or actions of neglecting, disliking, dropping out, or abandoning school are contrary to the requirements of the Compulsory Education Law. Once students understand that receiving education is legally binding, they will study more seriously and diligently.

Educating students' thoughts should primarily be the responsibility of the school, but families and society should also provide support. Only by conducting comprehensive, three-dimensional, coordinated, and all-around ideological education for students can we eliminate the idea that "studying is useless" and make them focus on their studies.

　　应对学生进行五种教育
    天津市宝坻县王卜庄高中  王宗征
    作为一名中学教师，我十分关心的是怎样使学生不产生“读书无用”念头，而有“读书有用”的认识。
    要做到这一点，我的看法是：
    首先，应对学生进行读书光荣、无知可耻的教育。古今中外的名人中不乏发愤读书的故事，可以此去激励学生刻苦学习。还可以告诉学生未来的世界将是什么样子的，使学生认识到那将是科学昌盛、人才济济的世界，从而增强读书求知的紧迫感。
    第二，帮助学生正确认识读书与修身立业的关系。教师要经常向学生灌输“学问是立身之本”的思想，使学生懂得在９０年代的文盲或“半文盲”都是不会有什么出息的，只有掌握了丰富的知识和技术，才能够立身于社会，为国家和民族建功立业。由此，便可激发学生的上进心和求知欲。
    第三，对学生进行尊敬老师、热爱学校的教育。通过这方面的教育，使学生感到接受“人类灵魂工程师”——老师的教育，在“神圣的殿堂”——学校里读书学习是莫大的幸福和自豪。学生一旦在心里产生这种优越感，就会愉快而自觉地进行读书学习。
    第四，对学生进行增强知识价值观念的教育，是必要的。在进行这种教育时，教师不宜把局部的暂时的“知识贬值”现象夸大、渲染，而应该从宏观到微观，从现实到未来的总体角度给学生讲清知识的价值，使学生感到知识确确实实有用，不掌握知识是行不通的。这样，学生就自然会把读书当成猎取知识的一种重要手段，不至于轻视读书了。
    第五，应对学生加强遵守义务教育法教育，使他们真正能体会到义务教育法的精神，认识到青少年接受教育、学习知识和文化，是对国家和民族应尽的责任和义务，任何轻学、厌学、辍学、弃学的想法或作法，都是与义务教育法的要求相悖的。学生一旦懂得自己接受教育原来是受法律约束的，就会更加认真而努力地学习了。
    对学生进行思想教育，当然应以学校为主，但家庭和社会要给予辅助。只有对学生进行这种综合的、立体的、配套的、全方位的思想教育，才可能使学生彻底消除“读书无用”的念头，使他们专心致志地投入学习。
