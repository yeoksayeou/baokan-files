The Three Gorges of the Yangtze River are famous for their unique landscapes, including the Yuelu Cliff in Yuezhou, the Ma'an Cliff in Chishui, and the Swallow Cliff in Nanjing. The Swallow Cliff, with its steep peaks and towering rocks, resembles a giant swallow soaring towards the opposite shore. This is one of the "Three Cliffs of the Yangtze River."

Due to its strategic importance, the Swallow Cliff has been a witness to the rise and fall of our nation over the centuries. The Ming Dynasty's founding emperor, Zhu Yuanzhang, wrote a poem about the Swallow Cliff: "The Swallow Cliff, a weight on the scale, a rainbow as the rod, what use is it? The crescent moon on the horizon is the hook, weighing my kingdom, how much does it hold!" This emperor ascended to the throne in Nanjing, and it is said that he landed at the Swallow Cliff. To this day, there is a stone tablet in the Imperial Pavilion at the Swallow Cliff, inscribed with a poem by the Qing Dynasty emperor Qianlong: "In years past, I heard of the waves lapping the shore, the roaring tides beneath my feet. But I am glad to see the rising sands forming green fields, the smoke from the villages and the plows in the fields, a scene of lasting peace." However, the "prosperity" of the Qianlong era was merely a fleeting glow before the end of the feudal society. Qianlong's dream of "lasting peace" was shattered soon after he inscribed his poem at the Swallow Cliff. During the Opium War, British invaders landed at the Swallow Cliff, threatening Nanjing. On a British warship in the Nanjing waters, the first unequal treaty in Chinese modern history, the "Treaty of Nanjing," was signed. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese invaders brutally massacred over 50,000 refugees and disarmed soldiers at the Swallow Cliff. This great tragedy is still deeply etched in the memory of the people of Nanjing, and there is a monument at the Swallow Cliff to commemorate the victims.

From the Swallow Cliff, following the river to the southwest, one can see the steep cliffs of the Mu Fu Mountain, which seem to have been carved by a knife. There are numerous caves of various sizes, each with its unique beauty. The ancient scholar Yuan Zongyan recorded 12 caves worth visiting in his "Record of the Caves Along the Swallow Cliff."

Entering the "Lower Cave" of the Three-Tiered Heavenly Caverns Park, one can see a clear pool of water reflecting the stalactites hanging from the ceiling. Climbing the narrow stone steps of the "Middle Cave," a faint light filters through the top of the cave, illuminating the strange rock formations. Ancient inscriptions can still be seen on the rocks. Ascending to the "One-Line Sky," one can look up and see a small patch of light in the otherwise dark ceiling, creating a sense of oppression, much like "a frog in a well." Geologically, this is known as a "waterfall cave." After struggling through the dark "Middle Cave," the spacious and bright "Upper Cave" brings a sense of relief. Finally, ascending to the "Overlooking the River Pavilion," one can enjoy the beautiful scenery of the river and the mountains, which is truly refreshing.

　　燕矶临流三台洞天
　　许亚洲
    奇峰突兀临江，怪石绝壁凌空，状如飞向彼岸的巨燕——这就是和岳阳城陵矶、马鞍山采石矶齐名的“长江三矶”之一的南京燕子矶。
    燕子矶由于它的险要而成为几百年来我们民族兴衰荣辱的见证。明太祖朱元璋《燕子矶》诗道：“燕子矶兮一秤砣，长虹作杆又如何？天边弯月是钩挂，称我江山有几多！”这位封建时代的君主当年到南京登基，正是从燕子矶上岸的。至今犹存燕子矶头御碑亭里的清代乾隆皇帝《题燕子矶》诗道：“当年闻说绕江澜，撼地洪涛足下看。却喜涨沙成绿野，烟村耕凿久相安。然而“乾嘉盛世”只是封建社会的回光返照。乾隆企盼的“久相安”迷梦，不久就在他题诗的燕子矶头破灭了。鸦片战争时，英国侵略军从燕子矶登陆，威胁南京。在南京江面的英国军舰上，签订了中国近代史上第一个不平等条约——《中英南京条约》。在抗日战争中，日寇在燕子矶江边野蛮屠杀了我５万多难民和已解除武装的军人。这起大惨案，南京人民至今仍深深铭记着，燕子矶头立有一块遇难同胞纪念碑。
    从燕子矶沿江向西南，一路经过似刀劈斧削的幕府山的大段悬崖峭壁，随处可见玲珑剔透的大小溶洞。前人阮宗瑗《游燕子矶沿山诸洞记》记载有１２个可游之洞。
    步入三台洞公园的“下洞”，一潭清澈的“观音泉”倒映出顶壁悬垂的石钟乳。沿着“中洞”的狭窄石阶盘旋而上，洞顶泻下些许微弱天光，映照在光怪陆离的石笋丛中，依稀可见古人遗留的题刻。攀援至“一线天”，仰视洞顶，一团漆黑中仅透出一线光明。这种景观造成一种压抑人的氛围，恰似“坐井观天”。地质学上称此为“落水洞”。奋力穿过黑暗的“中洞”，那宽敞光明的“上洞”使人心胸如释重负。最后登临“临江楼”，江景山色令人心旷神怡。
