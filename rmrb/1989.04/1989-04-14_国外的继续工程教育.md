With the advent of the new technological revolution, intensifying international competition, and rapid development of social production, the quality of scientific and technological engineering personnel must be continuously improved. How can this be achieved? Continuing engineering education is the best approach. Currently, continuing engineering education has been regarded by many countries as a key to catching up with advanced international scientific and technological levels and is being implemented as a strategic measure.

Over the past few years, continuing engineering education has become an important component of higher engineering education abroad. Continuing engineering education refers to the further education of scientific and technological personnel and managers who have already received higher education and are working in engineering and technical positions to acquire the latest knowledge.

Today, many countries not only attach importance to undergraduate and graduate education but also place greater emphasis on continuing engineering education for those who have graduated from higher education institutions.

Continuing engineering education is a product of contemporary scientific and technological progress, social and economic development, and the new technological revolution.

With the arrival of the new technological revolution, intensified international competition, and highly developed social production, it has become increasingly necessary to comprehensively improve the quality of scientific and technological engineering personnel. The phenomenon of knowledge and age becoming outdated simultaneously has become the biggest challenge for scientific and technological engineering personnel to maintain their technological vitality. The era of relying on a "one-time education" from universities to last a lifetime has become a thing of the past. Therefore, to solve this problem and maintain the vitality of the knowledge and technological structure of scientific and technological engineering personnel, continuing education is essential. This is an indispensable condition for scientific and technological engineering personnel to adapt to the needs of the times and is also a key to the prosperity and development of the country and to catching up with advanced international scientific and technological levels.

To this end, government departments and large, medium, and small enterprises in many countries have all taken continuing engineering education as a strategic measure to improve the competitiveness of enterprise production departments and national economies. Thus, continuing engineering education, which has long been spontaneous, supplementary, and small-scale, has gradually developed into an organized educational training system in many countries and is recognized by the international educational and business communities as a secret to promoting enterprise production development and social and economic progress. With the implementation and improvement of continuing engineering education abroad, some common characteristics have emerged in international continuing engineering education today:

1. Many countries have incorporated continuing engineering education into government and enterprise management, making it an important part of government administration and enterprise management. France has fully implemented continuing engineering education in government and enterprise departments, with government expenditures in this area accounting for about 20% of the country's total education budget, while enterprises contribute about 2% of the total wages of their employees. Currently, one-third of the engineers in some French enterprises are either fully or partially engaged in continuing engineering education.

The United States also attaches great importance to continuing engineering education. There are more than 12,000 engineering associations or universities nationwide that have established various types of continuing engineering education training centers. These centers receive strong support from relevant government departments or enterprise departments in terms of funding, faculty, and infrastructure. Currently, the number of engineers receiving continuing engineering education each year in the United States is approximately 15% of the total number of engineers in the country, with an average annual expenditure of over $3,000 per engineer on continuing education.

2. Some countries have ensured the development of continuing engineering education through legal means. These countries have clearly stipulated in their laws that scientific and technological engineering personnel have the right and obligation to receive continuing engineering education, and have specified the duration, cost, and proportion of personnel participating in further education and training.

For example, the "Unified Socialist Education System Regulations" of the former East Germany stipulate that the knowledge of scientific and technological engineering personnel who have received university education will become outdated in a short period of time. Relevant enterprises must formulate continuing engineering education plans and submit them to the National Higher Education Department for approval. The regulations clearly stipulate that those participating in continuing engineering education can be exempted from 36 working days per year, and enterprises should pay basic wages during the period of off-site study.

As early as 1977, France passed a law stipulating that employers with more than 10 employees must use 2% of their employees' wages for continuing engineering education. Currently, some large enterprises in France actually use 2% to 4% of wages for continuing engineering education, with a trend of increasing year by year. Other countries such as the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden have similar legal provisions.

3. Many countries have established universities as the development base for continuing engineering education. The normal development of continuing engineering education requires good organizational guarantees. In addition to enterprises setting up their own departments, universities are places where knowledge is concentrated and talents gather, making them very suitable for undertaking continuing engineering education work. Universities have established continuing engineering education departments, treating it as an important component of modern education.

Even research-oriented universities attach great importance to conducting continuing engineering education and place it on an equal footing with undergraduate and graduate education. For example, renowned American universities such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University are actively engaged in this work, promoting the improvement of continuing engineering education levels in the United States.

　　国外的继续工程教育
　　余逸群
    内容提要：随着新技术革命时代的到来，国际竞争的日益加剧，社会生产的迅速发展，科技工程人员素质须要不断提高。如何实现呢？继续工程教育是最佳途径。目前，继续工程教育已被许多国家视为赶超国际先进科技水平的关键之一，被作为一项战略性措施来实行。
    几年来，继续工程教育在国外已成为高等工科教育的重要组成部分。继续工程教育，是指那些业已受过大专以上的高等教育，并已在工程和技术工作岗位上工作的科技人员、管理人员进一步接受最新知识的教育。
    当今，许多国家不仅重视大学本科教育和研究生教育，而且更重视大专以上学生毕业后的继续工程教育。
    　　　　继续工程教育是当代科技进步、社会经济发展和新技术革命的时代
    　　产物
    随着新技术革命时代的到来，国际竞争的加剧，社会生产的高度发展，愈来愈有必要全面提高科技工程人员的素质；而知识和年龄同步老化的现象已成为当今科技工程人员难以保持技术活力的最大难题，那种依靠大学的“一次性教育”就可享用终身的时代已成为历史陈迹。因而，为了解决这一难题，保持科技工程人员知识和技术结构的活力，只有进行继续教育。这是使科技工程人员适应时代发展需要的必不可少的条件，也是国家兴旺发达，赶超国际先进科技水平的关键之一。
    　　　　继续工程教育是促进企业发展和社会经济进步的要素
    为此，许多国家的政府部门和大中小企业都纷纷把继续工程教育作为一项战略措施来抓，以提高企业生产部门和国家经济的竞争能力。这样，长期以来处于自发性的、补充性的、小规模的继续工程教育，在许多国家中逐步发展为一种有组织的教育培训制度，被国际教育界和企业界公认为是促进企业生产发展和社会经济进步的秘诀。随着国外继续工程教育的实施与完善，当今国际继续工程教育的发展已出现一些共同的特点：
    １、许多国家把继续工程教育纳入政府和企业管理，成为政府行政领导和企业管理的重要内容。法国在政府、企业部门全面开展继续工程教育，政府在这方面支付的经费约为全国普通教育经费的２０％；而企业支付的经费则为职工工资总额的２％左右。目前，法国的一些企业有１／３的工程师脱产或半脱产地接受继续工程教育。
    美国对继续工程教育也极为重视，全国已有１２０００多个工程师协会或大学建立各种类型的继续工程教育培训中心。这些中心在经费、师资、基建方面，都得到国家有关政府部门或企业部门的大力支持。美国目前每年接受继续工程教育的工程师人数大致为全美工程师总数的１５％，工程师人均继续教育费用每年超过３０００美元。
    ２、一些国家的政府以法律的形式确保继续工程教育的发展。这些国家在法律条款中明确规定科技工程人员享有继续工程教育的权利和义务，并规定了接受继续工程教育的期限、费用和参加进修培训的人员的比例。
    例如，民主德国的《统一社会主义教育制度法规》认为，受过大学教育的科技工程人员的知识在不长时间内会产生落后差距，有关企业必须制定继续工程教育方案，报国家高等教育部审批。该法规明确规定，参加继续工程教育者每年可免３６个工作日，离职学习期间企业应支付基本工资。
    法国早在１９７７年就通过法律规定，凡雇佣１０人以上的雇主必须用雇员工资的２％左右作为继续工程教育费用。现在，法国有些大企业实际用２％至４％的工资作为继续工程教育费用，且有逐年上升的趋势。其他一些国家像荷兰、丹麦、芬兰、瑞典等都有类似的法律规定。
    ３、不少国家把大学作为继续工程教育的发展基地。继续工程教育的正常发展必须有良好的组织保证，除去各企业部门自己办之外，大学是知识密集、人才荟萃之处，承担继续工程教育工作非常适合。大学中设立了继续工程教育部门，把它作为现代教育的重要组成部分。
    即使是研究性的大学，也非常重视举办继续工程教育，并将它特别提到本科和研究生教育同等重要的地位。像美国著名的麻省理工学院、斯坦福大学等都积极开展这方面的工作，促进了美国继续工程教育水平的提高。
