Early in March, the reporter often heard on the streets and alleys of Anhui Province's Anqing City: "If all levels of leading cadres could be as clean and upright as our municipal party secretary Fang Zhaoxiang, there would be hope for eradicating corruption."

I followed up with many ordinary citizens and old and new cadres, and visited Fang Zhaoxiang's home to talk with his wife. Here are some of the things I saw and heard.

Fang Zhaoxiang insists on riding a bicycle to and from work. When he is in the city, except for urgent matters, he also rides a bicycle or walks. This spring festival, he braved the rain to visit over 100 elderly cadres and teachers, which strengthened his emotional ties and gained him a lot of information.

He lives on the top floor of a five-story building, which is cold in winter and hot in summer. The housing management department has repeatedly suggested he move to the second or third floor, but he says, "I am better off than many crowded households and those without a home!" He refuses to move.

He has elderly parents and young children, and is the only man in the family, but because of his busy work, he does very little housework. He feels guilty for burdening his wife. Therefore, he still takes the initiative to carry the heavy task of buying rice. He is 46 years old, graduated from Anhui Agricultural University in 1964, and looks like a scholar, but carrying several tens of pounds of rice up to the fifth floor is no problem for him.

He rejects all gift-givers. Once, a gift-giver left a large package containing high-end items like Maotai, ginseng, and Yunyan cigarettes at his home and ran away. He discovered the package when he returned home and immediately sent it to his secretary's home, asking him to return it right away. He said, accepting gifts is selling one's integrity.

Early this year, he set a rule: when visiting factories and villages, it must be four dishes and one soup, no alcohol, and no one to accompany. The municipal party committee members unanimously agreed. He told me emotionally: "Our city, including the counties it governs, has a population of over 5 million. Currently, there are still 650,000 farmers with an annual income of less than 250 yuan. If we go down there and have a big meal, it often costs the annual income of one or two people. How can we eat it!"

He writes his own reports and speeches. He said, young and middle-aged cadres must prevent the degeneration of their pure hearts, and not think that once they become officials, they must maintain their "dignity." For a distance of a few hundred meters, they must be picked up by a car, and for speaking, they must have someone write for them. Over time, their bodies become lazy, their skills become weak, and their abilities never exceed the level of their secretaries. Being such an official is really pitiful...

Former chairman of the Political Consultative Conference and retired cadre Zhao Xinxin said: Fang Zhaoxiang's deeds of diligence and integrity are like a television series that is currently being broadcast. People watch it and say he is a good secretary for the people; we old comrades recommend him to take over, and we all feel gratified.

　　市委书记方兆祥二三事
    本报记者  张振国
    ３月初，记者在安徽省安庆市街头巷尾经常听到：“如果各级领导干部，都能像我们市委书记方兆祥那样为政清廉，根治腐败现象就有希望。”
    我跟踪采访了很多平民百姓和新老干部，并到方兆祥家访问了他的妻子。现将所见实情，节录一二。
    方兆祥上下班坚持骑自行车。在市区活动，除了急务，也是骑车或步行。今年春节期间，他冒雨骑车拜访１００多位老干部和老教师，密切了情感，获得大量信息。
    他家住在５层楼的顶层，冬冷夏热。房管部门多次要他搬到二、三层，他说：“我比很多拥挤户、无房户强多了！”怎么也不肯搬。
    他上有老下有小，又是全家唯一的男子汉，但因工作忙，家务事干得很少。对此，他深感劳累了妻子。因此，家中买米的重活，他还是主动承担。他现年４６岁，１９６４年毕业于安徽农学院，看上去是个书生，但扛几十斤大米上５楼，很不在乎。
    他对送礼者一概拒之门外。有个送礼人，曾把一个装有茅台、人参、云烟等高档商品的大包往他家一放，拔腿就跑。他回家发现此包，立刻送到秘书家中，请他立即退回。他说，收礼，就是卖贱骨。
    今年初，他立了规矩：下厂下乡，一律四菜一汤，不得喝酒，不用人陪。市委常委们一致同意。他动情地告诉我：“我市加上所带的县，计有５００多万人口，目前尚有６５万农民人均年收入还在２５０元以下。我们下去大吃一顿，往往要吃掉一两个人的年把收入，这怎么能吃得下去！”
    他汇报或报告，总是自己动手写稿。他说，中青年干部一定要防止质朴心态的异化，不能以为当了官，就得不失“体统”，几百米远，也要轿车接送，说话也要人家写，久而久之，身子懒了，本事小了，能力始终超不过秘书的水平，当这种官，实在可悲……
    原政协主席、离休老干部赵新民说：兆祥同志勤政、廉政的事迹，好像一部正在上演的电视连续剧，人们看着，都说他是百姓的好书记；我们老班子推荐他接班，无不感到欣慰。
