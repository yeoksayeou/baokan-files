People's Daily, Dortmund, April 8th.

The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) Congress concluded yesterday in the "Gold Hall" of the Westphalia Hall in Dortmund. The congress re-elected Japan's Ichiro Uchikawa as the president of the ITTF and decided that the 42nd World Table Tennis Championships in 1993 will be held in Mexico City. This is the first time such a competition will be held in Latin America.

The congress passed several important resolutions. Starting from the next World Championships, the men's team event will be changed to a best-of-five format, with each team fielding three players, including one doubles match, but each player can participate in a maximum of two matches. For the serve, it is stipulated that the ball must be tossed vertically from behind the end line of the table.

China's three proposals were approved: international competitions should use at least 30% foreign referees; neutral referees should be used throughout each match; and an international referee-in-chief position should be established.

Malaysia's two proposals were also approved: international referees will be divided into A and B levels in the future, with A-level referees not only having to pass theoretical exams but also having practical experience in major international competitions. In the future, continental and above-level competitions should use A-level referees. The issue of athletes' conduct will be addressed, with the ITTF taking measures and formulating rules.

The Soviet Union's proposal that on-court fouls should result in penalties, and that referees can penalize a game based on the severity of the offense, was also approved.

International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch arrived in Dortmund this afternoon and immediately went to the World Table Tennis Championships venue. Accompanied by ITTF President Ichiro Uchikawa and the organizing committee chairman, he watched the matches. Tomorrow, he will attend the closing ceremony.

　　国际乒联代表大会昨结束  通过重要决议和若干提案
    本报多特蒙德４月８日电记者江建国刘小明报道：国际乒联代表大会昨天在多特蒙德的威斯特法利亚厅的“金厅”结束。大会重新选举日本的荻村伊智郎任国际乒联主席，并决定１９９３年的第４２届世乒赛将在墨西哥城举行，这是第一次在拉丁美洲举办这种比赛。
    大会通过了几项重要决议。男子团体赛从下届世乒赛起将改为５场３胜制，双方各出３个队员，其中需有一场双打，但每个队员最多出场两次。对于发球，规定在台面端线后方，要垂直抛起。
    中国的３项提案获通过，它们是：世界级比赛应使用不少于３０％的外国裁判；自始至终每场比赛都应使用中立裁判；设立国际裁判长制度。
    马来西亚的两项提案也获得通过，即国际裁判将来要分Ａ、Ｂ两级，Ａ级裁判不仅要考理论，而且要有参加过国际重大比赛的实际经验。今后洲以上比赛应使用Ａ级裁判。运动员作风问题，授与国际乒联采取措施，制定规则。
    苏联提出的场上犯规要罚分，裁判还可根据情节严重与否罚一局的提案也获得通过。
    国际奥委会主席萨马兰奇今天下午抵达多特蒙德，随即来到世乒赛比赛场地。他在国际乒联主席荻村伊智郎和组委会主席盖普陪同下观看了比赛。明天他将出席闭幕式。
