The footsteps of spring have arrived on the British Isles. London has donned a vibrant and colorful spring attire. Streets and gardens are adorned with fresh green grass and fragrant blossoms. The British people regard Easter, which has arrived in this warm and blooming season, as their "second Christmas."

The first to announce the festive news is the commercial district of West London. On the eve of the festival, Oxford Street and Regent Street are bustling with people rushing to buy gifts, creating a lively atmosphere. On a weekend before the festival, the reporter visited a large supermarket in North London. Long queues of shoppers with carts full of groceries and miscellaneous items formed in front of each checkout counter, a scene rarely seen on ordinary days. The current shopping frenzy and travel boom are a reflection of the improved living standards of most British people in recent years. According to statistics, the average wage index of British workers increased from 100 in 1985 to 130.7 in November 1988. Since 1979, the living standards of British people have increased by approximately 23%.

On Easter Day, I visited the famous Regent's Park, Hyde Park, and Battersea Park. Indeed, everywhere was filled with poetic and picturesque festive scenery. The Easter costume parade on the south bank of the Thames in Battersea Park attracted audiences from all over, and the excitement was indescribable. The vibrant early spring atmosphere in Hyde Park and Regent's Park was also uniquely charming. Couples of elderly people walked their pets, families with parents and their little angels, pairs of young lovers hand in hand, and groups of students strolling together, all converged from different directions towards the parks. Their colorful spring attire harmoniously blended with the natural spring scenery. Some lay on the lush grass, basking in the warm sunshine; others laughed and chatted, strolling along the winding paths; some stood by the lake, watching swans pecking at food and mandarin ducks playing in the water; some read under the shade of trees, while others played football or swung on swings in the sports area... Everyone found their own enjoyment, truly feeling as if they were in the "Garden of Eden."

However, just as the withered reeds by the lake in Regent's Park contrast with the fresh green willows, this "Garden of Eden" is not entirely filled with spring colors.

Around 2 PM, as we sat on a bench by the roadside resting, two men in their forties with long beards approached us. They extended their dirty hands and said, "Happy Easter! Please give us a few pennies so we can have a cup of tea." They refused to withdraw their hands, repeating "please" more than ten times. Seeing that they would not leave, we gave them 10 pence. About ten steps away, they split the money into five pence each. At that moment, a neatly dressed man with a bow tie walked towards them. One of the beggars immediately stepped forward, shaking hands with the man while the other swiftly took off the man's hat and put it on his own head, then walked away without looking back. The man did not shout or curse; he seemed confused by the sudden action, standing there and watching them disappear into the distance.

Near the underground passage by the "Speakers' Corner" in Hyde Park, we saw an old artist kneeling on the ground drawing with chalk, surrounded by a pile of colorful chalk pieces. On the tiles, he drew several detailed pictures. Seeing his emaciated figure and the effort it took for him to draw while kneeling, sympathy welled up in our hearts. Kind-hearted visitors placed coins on two round drawings with "Thank you" written on them.

At around 6:30 PM, the sun began to set. We dragged our tired legs to the bus stop at "Speakers' Corner." At this moment, a man in his fifties wearing a faded old coat walked towards the trash can next to the bus stop. He reached into the trash can, picked up a piece of bread discarded by visitors, wiped it with his hand, and began to eat. An elderly man sitting next to us volunteered to talk to us, "Although the government provides unemployment benefits, single men still receive about 30 pounds a week, but it seems he is too poor. There are still many poor people like him in London!"

The bus arrived, and we boarded. Along the way, accompanied by the flickering streetlights, two starkly contrasting scenes alternated in my mind on this Easter Day, creating a strong contrast. It seems that how to achieve both economic efficiency and social equity, narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor, may be a common challenge faced by Western societies.

### 伦敦春意——复活节见闻

　　伦敦春意
　　——复活节见闻
　　陈特安
    春天的脚步已迈进了英伦三岛。伦敦披上了绚丽斑斓的春装，街头院内，芳草添绿，繁花飘香。被英国人视为“第二圣诞”的复活节在这春暖花开的时节来临了。
    最先把节日的讯息告诉人们的，是西伦敦的商业区。节日前夕，牛津街、摄政街忙于节日购物的人群熙来攘往，好不热闹。节日前的一个周末，记者在北伦敦一家大超级市场购物，一架架计价收费机前面都是推着一车车食品杂货的购物者长龙，盛况非同往常。眼前这种购物热、旅游热，正是近年来多数英国人生活水平提高的一个缩影。据统计，英国职工的平均工资指数，从１９８５年的１００增加到１９８８年１１月的１３０．７，自１９７９年以来，英国人的生活水平，平均提高了２３％左右。
    复活节那天，我来到闻名的摄政公园、海德公园和巴特西公园。果然，处处是富有诗情画意的节日风光。泰晤士河南岸巴特西公园的复活节化装游行吸引了来自各地的观众，其热闹劲自不待言。海德公园和摄政公园生机盎然的早春气息，也别具诱人的魅力。一对对老年夫妇牵着爱犬、一家家父母带着他们的小天使、一双双青年情侣并肩携手、一群群学生结伴同行，从四面八方涌向公园，他们五颜六色的春装与大自然的春色和谐地融为一体，有的斜卧在芳草如茵的草地上，尽情地沐浴在明媚的阳光下；有的欢声笑语，漫步在曲径通幽的小道上；有的津津有味，站在湖边观看天鹅啄食、鸳鸯戏水；有的在树荫下看书，有的在体育之角踢足球、荡秋千……人人各得其所、各尽其乐，真有到了人间“伊甸园”之感慨。
    然而，犹如摄政公园湖边堤坡上十几株干枯的芦苇与嫩绿的垂柳相映成趣一样，在这人间的“伊甸园”里也并非满园春色。
    下午二时许，我们坐在路旁长椅小憩时，两个蓄着长胡子的４０开外的男子向我们走来。他们伸出脏乎乎的手说：“复活节快乐！请给几个便士，我们好去喝杯茶”。他们摊开的手不肯收回去，一连说了十几个“请”字。我们见他们纠缠着不肯离去，便掏出１０便士给了他们。在离我们十来步远处，他们二一添做五分掉了。此时迎面来了一个打着领结、文质彬彬的男人，他们中的一位马上迎上前去，伸出右手与那位男子热烈握手之时，左手却一下子就把那男子的帽子摘下来，戴在自己头上，然后头也不回地扬长而去。那个男子没有怒骂，也没有呼叫，他似乎被这突如其来的举动弄糊涂了，他愕然地站在那里，望着他们渐渐远去的背影。
    在海德公园演讲之角的地下通道旁，我们看见一位老艺人跪在地上用粉笔做画，身旁堆了一大堆五颜六色的粉笔头。在地砖上画着几幅颇为细腻的图画，看着他那消瘦的身躯，看着他跪在地上吃力做画的样子，同情之心油然而升。好心的游客在写着“谢谢你”的两张圆形画上，放上一枚枚硬币。
    下午６点半时分，夕阳西隐。我们拖着疲惫的双腿来到“演讲之角”的汽车站候车。在这当儿，一个身着褪了色旧大衣的五十多岁的男人走向车站旁一个垃圾桶，伸手在垃圾桶里翻了几下，捡起一块游人抛弃的面包，用手擦了擦，便吃了起来。坐在我们身旁的一位六十开外的老人主动地和我们说：“尽管政府有失业救济，单身汉每周也有３０来英镑，但看来，他是太穷了，像这样的穷人，在伦敦还不少呢！”
    车进站了，我们上了汽车。一路上，伴随着街灯闪烁，在复活节这一天里，两幅截然不同的图景交替浮现在我的脑际，形成强烈的反差。看来，如何做到既讲究经济效果，又顾及社会公平，缩小贫富之间的鸿沟，也许是西方社会普遍面临的一个课题。
