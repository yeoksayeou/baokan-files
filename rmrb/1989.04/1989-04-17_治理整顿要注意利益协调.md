Why are there orders that are not followed and prohibitions that are not heeded? The root cause lies in the conflict between local interests and overall interests.

Why does regional protectionism occasionally resurface? The root cause lies in the conflicts of interest between different regions.

Why do various "wars" frequently occur? The root cause lies in the conflicts of interest between different departments and regions.

Why do certain imbalances in the industrial structure worsen? The root cause lies in the guidance of comparative interests.

In a nutshell, behind the various economic problems today, there are conflicts of interest among different interest groups. In the process of economic rectification, grasping this essence and paying attention to the coordination of interests is the effective approach.

The drawbacks of the old economic system can be discussed at length, but it is important not to overlook the fundamental issue of interest coordination. If one does not acknowledge that each local entity has relatively independent interests, then one does not acknowledge the need for interest coordination, which will inevitably suppress the enthusiasm of regions, departments, enterprises, and even individuals. When transitioning to a new system, we acknowledge the relatively independent interests of local entities, mobilize the enthusiasm of all parties, and the problem of interest coordination naturally comes to the fore. In this situation, one cannot simply blame some people for "not listening" but should instead study what kind of interest relationships lead them to act this way.

The market economy is about equal competition. The coordination of interests is crucial in establishing rules for equal competition. It is impossible for the state to directly and fairly allocate interests, nor is it what people demand. What people demand is this: the rules of the game must be equal, at least they should strive to be equal. What is meant by "unification" is actually unification in the coordination of reasonable rules and equal competition. Only such rules can be accepted by all parties and have greater authority. Various "wars" often arise due to unreasonable prices, unreasonable distribution of interests among various links, unreasonable allocation of export quotas among regions—more products but fewer quotas, fewer products but more quotas, and unreasonable differences in the retention of foreign exchange earnings by various operating units, etc. If we cannot solve these problems well and coordinate the interests of all parties, even the strictest administrative orders will be difficult to eradicate such "wars."

It is not to say that administrative measures should not be used. Especially when macro conditions limit the coordination of interests in the short term, using administrative measures to make local and immediate interests subordinate to overall and long-term interests is completely necessary. However, one must be clear that this can only be a transitional measure, and administrative measures should not be used to solidify or even strengthen unreasonable interest structures. Ultimately, economic problems must be solved by economic means.

How to combine economic rectification with deepening reforms? This is a question worth considering. Paying attention to the coordination of interests during economic rectification can help explore a new approach to macro control.

　　治理整顿要注意利益协调
　　文牛
    为什么有令不行，有禁不止？究其根，乃局部利益和全局利益之间的矛盾使其然。
    为什么地方保护主义时有抬头？究其根，乃各地方之间的利益矛盾使其然。
    为什么各种大战频繁发生？究其根，乃各部门、地区之间的利益矛盾使其然。
    为什么产业结构的某些失调会加剧？究其根，乃比较利益的引导使其然。
    一句话，在目前种种经济问题的背后，隐藏着的是不同利益主体之间的利益矛盾。在治理整顿中抓住这个实质，注意利益协调，才是有效的办法。
    旧经济体制的弊端可以说得很多，恐怕抹煞了利益协调是根本之点。因为不承认各个局部有相对独立的利益，也就不承认需要利益协调，必然会压抑了地区、部门、企业乃至个人的积极性。向新体制过渡的时候，我们承认了局部的相对独立利益，调动了各方面积极性，利益协调问题也就由隐到显地突出出来了。这种情况下，不能只简单地责怪有些人“不听话”，而要研究是什么样的利益关系使他们这样做。
    商品经济是讲平等竞争的。所谓利益协调，很重要的是制订平等竞争的规则。由国家直接地公平分配利益是做不到的，也不是人们所要求的。大家只要求这一点：竞赛规则要平等，起码尽量趋向平等。所谓统一，实际上统一在协调合理、规则平等上。这样的规则才为各方心悦诚服，才更具权威性。所谓各种“大战”，往往是由于价格不合理，各个环节的利益分配不合理，各地区出口额分配不合理——产品多的配额少，产品少的配额多，各经营单位所得出口外汇留成差别不尽合理等等原因酿成的。如果我们的规则不能把这些问题解决好，把各方利益协调好，再硬的行政命令，也难以根除这类“大战”的。
    不是说不应该使用行政手段。特别是由于宏观条件限制，利益很难一时协调好的时候，用行政办法，让局部利益、眼前利益服从全局利益、长远利益，是完全必要的。但一定要清醒，这只能是一种过渡性措施，且不可用行政办法把不合理的利益格局凝固化甚至强化。归根到底，经济问题最终要靠经济办法解决。
    治理整顿如何同深化改革结合起来？这是值得思考的问题。在治理整顿中注意利益协调，有助于从中摸索出一条宏观控制的新路子。
