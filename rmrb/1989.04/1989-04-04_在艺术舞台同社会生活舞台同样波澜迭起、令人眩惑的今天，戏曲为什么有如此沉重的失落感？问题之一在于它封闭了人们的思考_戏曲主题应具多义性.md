In an era where both the artistic stage and the social stage are tumultuous and bewildering, why does traditional opera carry such a heavy sense of loss? One of the problems lies in its confinement of people's thoughts.

The theme of traditional opera should have multiple meanings.

Opera often aims to educate by promoting good and punishing evil, using loyalty, filial piety, righteousness, and chastity as moral benchmarks to make clear judgments about life. Its themes are standardized, narrow, and singular due to being constrained by educational purposes. It is framed within moral boundaries, and morality is simplified into good and evil, with no middle ground. It praises loyal subjects, filial sons, righteous husbands, and chaste wives, while condemning treacherous officials, wicked husbands, and adulterous women. It does not acknowledge the complexity of morality and rejects the idea of multiple meanings in themes, repeatedly reinforcing moral standards. Traitorous villains like Chen Shimei are executed; Wang Kui is strangled; Mo Ji is beaten; Zhang Jibao is killed. Singular themes are the primary way opera reflects life. The space for self-reflection and exploration of those who are educated is occupied.

The singularity of themes contrasts sharply with the contemporary spirit of diverse exploration. It does not add wings to people's thoughts but suffocates their spirits in a closed moral chamber. Opera has become disconnected from the spirit of self-liberation of the times. Unfortunately, the more definitive conclusions are dressed in unquestionable armor, the more they raise doubts. The extreme wickedness of Pan Jinlian only raises more questions. The educational purpose leads to counter-education.

This singular theme arises from the distortion of opera's essence by morality. Its themes are often alienated into pure ideologies without their own characteristics.

Its formation is also closely linked to the feudal autocratic system. Singularity itself is a shackle. The feudal system requires people to have extremely simplified moral concepts under singular cultural conditions. It most detests thoughts that transcend "singularity." Singular themes are based on singular characters. People living under the feudal autocratic system are abstracted into good and evil; good and bad. The good are as pure as jade; the bad are as black as ink. This devalues people's reality and true worth. People feel ugly and inhuman in the face of unattainable superhumans. Therefore, opera characters are mostly monochromatic. Guan Yu's loyalty and Cao Cao's treachery are as singular as their facial expressions. San Niang has no spring sorrow or autumn grief; Wu Song has no filial piety. They are completely moralized. This cannot reveal the complexity of life, especially the complexity of human nature.

Opera should explore themes with multiple meanings and establish a new thematic framework, liberating its themes from old moral models. This means: based on the spirit of the times, establishing the subjectivity of people in opera, forming a comprehensive view centered on people. Only when writers turn their gaze to the world of people, with a respectful and tolerant attitude, acknowledging the reality of people themselves, can people become the objects of spiritual dissection and psychological exploration by writers. Only then can the complexity of human nature be discovered. You will find that when the most essential aspects of human nature are presented in various forms of character, emotion, and thought, they do not all have moral significance. As long as you give people flesh and blood, they cannot be explained by simple moral classifications of good and evil. On the contrary, people always present their true existence as a composite and ambiguous moral entity. From this, it can be seen that restoring the reality of people in opera (not referring to the method of presentation) itself contains the significance of removing historical stains and promoting the revival of opera.

Themes with multiple meanings have existed since ancient times. The theme of "The Peony Pavilion" cannot be summarized in a few words. Influenced by the enlightened thoughts of the late Ming Dynasty, "The Eternal Palace" and "The Peach Blossom Fan" have themes that have sparked endless debates to this day. Because they reveal the multifaceted depths of life, people will have different understandings from different angles, seeing things differently. It is futile to insist on giving Yang Guifei a black or white conclusion. The author of "The Eternal Palace" had no such intention. The author's efforts were focused on the authenticity of the image. You might find this character difficult to understand, who exactly is she? The author leaves it to the readers and audience. The novel "Dream of the Red Chamber" is the same; only by understanding it from multiple angles can it be grasped. The performance of "Mountain Spirit" in Xiang Opera is enlightening.

Traditional opera creation has flashes of human nature, with authors taking the exploration of human nature as their value orientation. This makes their works shine with artistic brilliance, presenting a colorful life scene. Some actors, with their personal experiences and genuine singing skills, project human nature through the gaps in those characters severely stiffened by morality. This is often overlooked by people, but the life of opera lies in these hidden places. The so-called multiple meanings of themes are not without themes. They reflect the author's "multi-colored" emotions, as well as the multi-faceted directions of psychology, consciousness, and thought, and the multi-faceted presentation of life's content. Based on this, the overall trend of the theme is subtly formed.

Advocating for themes with multiple meanings is not a blanket rejection of singularity. We need to consider the cultural level and limitations of the audience. Additionally, from "Picking Cotton" and "Drumming for Flowers," as well as various small life plays, joke plays, and martial arts plays, it is difficult to find multiple meanings, and singularity often has a simple beauty and cannot be generalized. But if we take a macro view of opera, that singular theme, in the face of the deepening understanding of history and reality, naturally exposes its emptiness and shallowness, becoming a potential crisis for opera.

The difficulty lies in the fact that many of our authors' creative thinking still lingers at a shallow level, lacking philosophical reflection on people. Many works continue to write political assessments for characters in the play, cheaply replacing feudalism with anti-feudalism. This is criticizing history while sitting in the historical prison of promoting good and punishing evil; it is rebelling against tradition within the traditional framework, and rebelling against traditional morality within the moral walls that confine the spirit. They still have not truly turned their gaze to people. Opera must restore its nature, first by restoring the subjectivity of people—people are no longer tools for moral propaganda.

The regenerative power of opera can only come from the return of human nature rooted in the deep structure. I say it's futile to try to apply some external ointment to its surface injuries.

　　在艺术舞台同社会生活舞台同样波澜迭起、令人眩惑的今天，戏曲为什么有如此沉重的失落感？问题之一在于它封闭了人们的思考 
    戏曲主题应具多义性
    祝肇年
    戏曲常常以劝善惩恶为教化宗旨，以忠孝节义为善恶尺标，对人生进行明确的礼教裁决。它的主题因被教化宗旨所规范，所以较为定型、狭窄、单一。它被镶入道德的轨范，而道德又被简化为善恶两极，非此即彼。颂扬的是忠臣、孝子、义夫、节妇；鞭笞的是奸臣、恶夫、淫妇。它不承认道德的复合性；排斥主题的多义性，只是不断复写着道德准则。忘恩负义的坏蛋陈世美，铡了；王魁，掐死；莫稽，狠揍；张继保，殛毙。单一性主题是戏曲涵盖生活的主要方式。“受教化者”应有的自我思考和探索空间被占领。
    单一性的主题和当代人们多元化的探索精神形成鲜明的时代落差。它不能为人的思考增添双翅；而是把人的精神窒息在封闭的道德禁室。戏曲和人们自我解放的时代精神要求脱钩了。遗憾的是，越是给堂皇结论穿上不容置疑的铠甲，越是启人疑窦。潘金莲的极度凶淫，反倒惹人疑惑丛生。教化的宗旨导致反教化。
    这种单一性主题导源于戏曲本体被道德所扭曲。它的主题往往被异化成为没有自身特性的纯意识形态。
    它的形成还和封建专制政体有着十分微妙的联系。单一性本身就是一种桎梏，封建制度要求人们在单一的文化条件下道德观念极端简化。它最忌讳的就是超越“单一”的胡思乱想。单一性主题又是以单一性人物为基础的。在封建专制政体中生活的人被抽象为善的、恶的；好的、坏的。好的洁白如玉；坏的漆黑似墨。以此来贬损人的现实性和人的真实价值。人在永远不可企及的超人面前自觉丑陋得不像人。所以戏曲人物多半是单色的。关羽的忠义和曹操的奸诈，就像他们脸色一样的单一。三娘不会有春愁秋怨；武松不会有儿女之情。他们完全被道德程式化了。这，不可能揭示复杂的生活内蕴，尤其是人性的复杂性。
    戏曲应该探索主题的多义性，应该建立新型的主题格局，把它的主题从旧的道德模式中解放出来。这就是：根据时代精神要求，确立人在戏曲中的主体地位，形成以人为中心的涵容万象。只有作家的目光转向人的世界，以尊重和宽容的态度承认人自身的现实性，人才能成为被作家进行精神解剖和心理探奇的对象，人性的复杂性才可能被发现。您会察觉，当人性中那些最本质的东西以性格、感情、思想的诸种形式展现时并不都具有道德意义。只要您赋予人以血肉之躯，人就不可能以善恶二元的简单道德分类来说明他自身。相反，人总是以道德的复合体和朦胧性来显示他的真实存在的。由此可见，在戏曲中恢复人的现实性（不是指的表现手法），这本身就含有排除历史污垢、促使戏曲复苏的变革意义。
    多义性主题古已有之。《牡丹亭》的主题就不是三言两语所能概括清楚的。受晚明启蒙思想影响的《长生殿》、《桃花扇》，其主题引发的争议，迄今无定论。因为它们展示的生活底蕴是多方面的，人们从不同视角去认识时就会产生不同的理解，见仁见智。若要执拗地给杨贵妃作出黑的白的结论都是徒劳的。《长生殿》的作者根本没有这种企图，作者的心血所注在于形象的真实性。您或许觉得这个人物难以理解，她究竟是什么人？作者留给读者和观众了。小说《红楼梦》同样如此，只有从多视角去理解才能把握。湘剧《山鬼》的演出是给人启示的。
    传统戏曲创作中存在着斑斑点点的人性闪光，作者把对人性的开掘作为它的价值取向，这就在他们的作品里泛起艺术的云霞，展现出五色斑斓的生活图景。还有些演员，他们以自身的心灵体验和真切的演唱技巧，透过那些被道德严重僵化了的人物空隙投射出人性的春熙。这一点，经常被人们视而不见，但戏曲的生命却在这隐密之处蠕动。所谓多义性主题不是无主题。它反映的是作者的“复色”感情，以及心理的、意识的、思想的多方面的走向，生活内涵的多方面展现。以此为基础，隐曲地形成主题的总体大趋势。
    倡导主题的多义性并不是一律排斥单一性。我们要考虑观众文化层次和局限，另外，从《拾棉花》、《打花鼓》以及若干生活小戏、玩笑戏、武打戏中是难以找到多义性的，单一往往具有单纯之美，不能一概而论。但若对戏曲作宏观的审视，那种单一性主题在人们对历史和现实的思考日益深入的大态势下，就自然暴露出它的空虚和俚浅，成为戏曲的潜在危机。
    困难还在于我们的许多作者的创作思维至今还迟迟地停留在浅层次上，缺乏对人的哲理性思辨。不少作品继续在给剧中人写政治鉴定，十分廉价地把封建改为反封建。这是坐在劝善惩恶的历史囚笼里批判历史；在传统的框架中反传统，在圈禁精神的道德围墙里反传统道德。至今也没有把目光真正转到人的身上。戏曲要恢复它的本性，首先要恢复人的主体意识——人不再成为张扬道德的工具。
    戏曲的再生力只能是植根于深层结构中的人性的复归。想从皮儿上给它擦点外伤药膏，我说那是瞎操心。
