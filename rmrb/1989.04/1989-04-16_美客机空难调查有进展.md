	The New York Times reported today that the U.S. side has preliminarily confirmed that the bomb that destroyed a Pan Am airliner over Scotland last year was inadvertently brought onto the plane by a man named Jaffa, an American citizen of Lebanese descent.

	The report quoted an American government official as saying that an agent of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, which is supported by Syria, hid the bomb in Jaffa's luggage. Thus, Jaffa unknowingly carried the bomb onto the plane. The incident resulted in the deaths of all 259 passengers and crew members on board.

	The report said that FBI personnel are narrowing the scope of their investigation, but so far have not obtained more specific results. Therefore, it is currently not possible to take any arrest actions. The report did not specify Jaffa's exact identity.

　　美客机空难调查有进展
    新华社华盛顿４月１３日电　《纽约时报》今天报道，美国方面已初步确认，去年在苏格兰上空炸毁泛美航空公司客机的炸弹是被一位名叫贾法的美籍黎巴嫩人无意之中带上飞机的。
    该报援引一位美国政府官员的话说，叙利亚支持的解放巴勒斯坦人民阵线（总部）的一名特工人员将炸弹藏在了贾法的行李之中。这样，贾法就在不知不觉中将炸弹带上了飞机。这起空难事件致使机上２５９名旅客和机组人员全部罹难。
    该报说，美国联邦调查局的人员正在缩小调查范围，但目前尚未获得更为具体结果。所以目前不可能采取任何逮捕行动。该报没有说明贾法的具体身份。
