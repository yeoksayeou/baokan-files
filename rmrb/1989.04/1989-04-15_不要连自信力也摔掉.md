A somersault in Dortmund has left the Chinese table tennis team in a tough spot, making it seem like the advantage in table tennis has suddenly shifted to the other side of the globe. Those who had previously warned of the "wolf" coming have changed their tune: our technology is lagging, our new players are not up to par, reclaiming the Swaythling Cup will take at least five or six years...

These words are hard for the Chinese people to hear. After all, out of seven cups, China has won three, which is an advantage, right? Out of 26 medals, China has taken half, while the second-placed Sweden and South Korea each have only three. Just looking at this gap, one cannot say that China is no longer the table tennis king. The idea that the green ball table is forever China's domain is the only way to define an advantage, but this notion may not align with the laws of development. Chinese athletes have their own physical and technical characteristics, making it easier for them to show an advantage in table tennis. People's expectations are therefore particularly high, and the standards for table tennis advantage are exceptionally stringent. The loss to the Swedish team has even shaken our confidence.

We need to develop new technologies and cultivate new talents, but more importantly, we must not lose our confidence. As the era of multi-polar competition in the world of table tennis arrives, the weight of the trophies increases, and winning cups with higher "gold content" holds more significance than victories without opponents. Our players and fans should have this spirit and revive the table tennis glory.

### 不要连自信力也摔掉

　　不要连自信力也摔掉
　　汪大昭
    多特蒙特的一个跟斗，把中国乒乓球队摔得够苦，好像乒乓优势一夜之间忽然转到地球的另一边。曾经大呼警惕“狼来了”的球界人士也换了一种调门：我们技术落后，新手不行，重夺斯韦思林杯至少要五六年……
    这话让国人听来怪不是滋味。其实，七座奖杯中国得了三座，算不算优势？２６块奖牌中国拿走一半，排第二位的瑞典和南朝鲜都只有三块。仅看这个差距，就不能说中国已称不上乒乓王国。墨绿色的球台永远是中国人的一统天下才称得优势，这个观念恐怕未必符合事物发展的规律。中国运动员有自己的身体和技术特点，在乒乓球运动中比较容易表现出优势。人们的要求就格外苛刻，对乒乓优势的指标也分外高，对致输给瑞典队，连自信力也发生了动摇。
    要发展新技术，也要培养新尖子，但比这更要紧的是不能失掉自信力。世界乒坛的奖杯随着群雄竞争时代的到来，分量越来越重，夺取“含金量”更高的奖杯，要比面无对手的胜利意义大得多。我们的选手和球迷要以这样的气概，再振乒乓雄风。
