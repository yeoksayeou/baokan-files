Title: Why Should a Singer Chase After Madness?

Perhaps it is because after intense work one needs to relax, watching an entertainment film is not without its benefits; and also out of interest in the current popularity of popular songs, I, who usually consider watching movies as "getting cheated," went to see "Crazy Singer" because I heard it was starring Mao Amin.

I thought this would be a light song and dance, besides Mao Amin's melodious voice, there are also Li Li and Gu Jianfen, masters of popular music, composing and directing (Li Li also conducts), there must be about ten good songs to listen to. Who would have thought that the film, from the beginning, would lead the audience into a confusing and absurd criminal case: with a loud bang, the husband of the singer Wu Yani (holding Wu's marriage certificate and a blood-stained shirt to blackmail Wu) falls into a pool of blood; police officers and a female reporter pretending to be a police officer appear one after another, interspersed with the singer's ambiguous entanglements with her lover, an old painter; there is also the singer's admirer, a taxi driver, who, despite his wife's jealousy and the presence of thugs, bravely steps forward to claim to be the "murderer" and willing to be a scapegoat. The neon-lit dance halls make one mistake China for America (though America is not all like this), and the drunken and debauched scenes with large amounts of money (one grab is a bag full), make one think that singers, dancers, taxi drivers, and even ordinary farmers have all reached the stage of throwing money around. Mixed with scenes of cars speeding past containers, police cars blocking and chasing motorcycles, and long shots of narrow escapes. Finally, when Yani occasionally shows her talent on the music stage, one finds that her singing is often disrupted by speeding trains and sirens, and the wish to listen to a few good songs becomes a bubble. No wonder the audience keeps complaining: "We've been fooled!"

In fact, musical films full of truth and goodness, which allow people to appreciate music and cultivate their morals, such as "The Sound of Music," are not uncommon. Why must one chase after such a clichéd style? The script is full of logical and moral chaos, and the director is particularly fond of the model of fighting and murder, even the most beautiful voice cannot turn vulgarity into magic.

This also reflects a bad trend in the film industry!

　　歌女何须逐疯狂
    张半解
    或许是紧张工作之余须求精神松弛，看看娱乐片未尝无益；又出于对时下通俗歌曲走红的兴趣，使我这每称看电影为“上当”者慕名一睹《疯狂歌女》——因为听说是毛阿敏主演。
    原想这是轻歌曼舞，除了毛阿敏的莺喉婉转，还有李黎夫、谷建芬等流行曲作高手赋谱执鞭（黎夫兼指挥），定有十来首好歌听了。谁料影片一开始就把观众带进一桩扑朔迷离荒诞不经的刑事案件之中：随着一声巨响，歌女吴雅妮的丈夫（持有与吴的结婚证和要挟吴的一件血衣）倒在血泊之中；公安人员和冒充公安人员的女记者相继登场，穿插着歌女与其情人老画家的暧昧纠葛；更有歌女的崇拜者出租汽车司机，不惜娇妻吃醋恶棍横行，挺身而出自称是“杀人犯”甘作替罪羊。灯红酒绿的舞厅使人误把中国当作美国（其实美国并非都是如此），纸醉金迷大把的人民币（一拿就是一提包），更使人以为歌星舞星出租汽车司机以至普通农民都发到了掷金如土的地步。杂以从外国影片中趸来的飞车撞过集装箱，嗽嗽叫的警车堵截夺路而逃的摩托的有惊无险的长镜头。好不容易盼出雅妮在歌坛偶露峥嵘，谁知引吭高歌时常被飞驰的火车、警笛扰乱，听几首好歌的愿望终成泡影。难怪观众叨个没完：“咱们给涮了！”
    其实，充满真与善，给人以音乐欣赏又能陶冶情操的音乐片如《音乐之声》者亦不鲜见，何必定去追逐这种落套的格调呢？剧本本来就满是逻辑混乱道德混乱，导演偏偏钟情于武打与情杀的模式，再美的歌喉也难以化庸俗为神奇。
    这，也反映了影坛中一种不好的文风吧！
