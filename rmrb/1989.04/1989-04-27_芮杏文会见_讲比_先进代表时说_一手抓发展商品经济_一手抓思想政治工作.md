Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 27th.

Rui Xingwen, a member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, today met with representatives of advanced collectives and individuals who have excelled in the "Speak of Ideals, Compare Contributions" campaign. He said that China's construction and reform practices have increasingly proven that it is not enough to focus solely on economic development without considering the socialist direction or ideals.

Rui Xingwen said that from the reforms and practices of recent years, it has become increasingly clear that it is important to simultaneously develop the socialist commodity economy and work in the ideological and political spheres.

Rui Xingwen hoped that the representatives from the scientific and technological community present, as well as all Communist Party members, cadres, workers, peasants, students, residents, members of democratic parties, and patriotic democrats across the country, would seriously study the editorial "We Must Clearly Oppose the Turmoil" published in the People's Daily. He urged them to take active steps, decisively and swiftly stop the turmoil created by a small number of people, and maintain a stable and united political situation. He said that without a stable and united political situation, reform and opening up, rectification and development, price control, improved living standards, anti-corruption efforts, and the building of democracy and the legal system would all become illusions. China would become a country in turmoil with no future.

Rui Xingwen pointed out that maintaining a stable and united political situation requires adhering to the Party's four cardinal principles. Without adhering to these principles, there can be no stable and united political situation, and it would be impossible to focus on reform and opening up and the modernization drive.

State Councilor Zhou Jiaxuan also spoke at the meeting. He said that the success of an enterprise depends on whether it can simultaneously promote material civilization and spiritual civilization. If an enterprise lacks a socialist political direction, it has no future.

State Councilor Song Jian also spoke.

　　芮杏文会见“讲比”先进代表时说    
    一手抓发展商品经济  一手抓思想政治工作
    据新华社北京４月２７日电  中共中央书记处书记芮杏文今天在接见“讲理想、比贡献”先进集体和先进个人代表时说，中国建设和改革的实践越来越证明，只埋头抓经济不问社会主义方向、不讲理想是不行的。
    芮杏文说，从近年来的改革与实践中，越来越看出一手抓发展社会主义商品经济，一手抓思想政治领域工作的重要性。
    芮杏文希望在座的科技界代表和全国广大共产党员、干部、工人、农民、学生、居民以及各民主党派成员、爱国民主人士，认真学习《人民日报》社论《必须旗帜鲜明地反对动乱》，积极行动起来，坚决、迅速地制止由极少数人制造的动乱，维护安定团结的政治局面。他说，没有安定团结的政治局面，改革开放、治理整顿、建设发展、控制物价、改善生活、反对腐败现象，建设民主与法制，都将成为泡影，中国将变为一个动乱不安的、没有前途的中国。
    芮杏文指出，保持安定团结的政治局面，必须坚持党的四项基本原则。不坚持四项基本原则，就没有安定团结的政治局面，也就不可能一心一意地进行改革开放和四化建设。
    国务委员邹家华也在接见时讲了话。他说，一个企业能不能抓好，在于物质文明和精神文明能否一起抓。假如一个企业没有社会主义政治方向，是没有前途的。
    国务委员宋健也讲了话。
