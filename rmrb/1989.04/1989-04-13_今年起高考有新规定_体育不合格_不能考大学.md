People's Daily, Beijing, April 12th. Reporter Bi Quan Zhong reports: Starting this year, higher education admissions will implement a new regulation by the State Education Commission. All students with normal physical conditions must meet the physical education standards to be eligible to apply for higher education institutions. Those who do not meet the physical education standards will not be eligible to apply.

A relevant official from the State Education Commission stated at today's press conference that this regulation is a reform in the college entrance examination system and has significant implications. It will help address the tendency to pursue high admission rates solely, and it will play a major role in rectifying the educational philosophy of middle schools and enhancing the physical fitness of middle school students.

When discussing what constitutes the "physical education standards," the official mentioned that students with normal physical conditions who meet the following three requirements are considered to have passed the physical education standards: First, students must regularly attend physical education classes, not be absent without a valid reason, have a serious attitude during classes, not be lazy, and pass the physical education course assessment. Second, students must regularly engage in physical exercise, voluntarily participate in the national physical fitness standards tests, and develop the habit of regular physical exercise. Third, students must follow the school's regulations and complete morning exercises and inter-class exercises on time every day, and participate in extracurricular physical activities for at least two hours per week. These standards are practical for most middle school students, and they can be achieved with serious effort.

　　今年起高考有新规定
　　体育不合格　不能考大学
    本报北京4月12日讯　记者毕全忠报道：从今年起，高校招生将实行国家教委作出的一项新规定，凡身体正常的学生体育达到合格标准者才能报考高等学校，体育不合格者均不能报考。
    国家教委有关负责人在今天的新闻发布会上指出，作出这项规定是高校招生工作的一项改革，意义深远。它不仅有助于克服片面追求升学率的倾向，对端正中学办学思想、增强中学生的体质都会起重大作用。在谈到什么是“体育合格标准”时，这位负责人说，凡身体正常的学生达到以下三项要求，就算是体育合格：一，体育课坚持出勤，不无故缺课，上课时态度认真，不偷懒，体育课考核成绩及格；二，经常坚持体育锻炼，自觉参加《国家体育锻炼标准》的测验，养成经常锻炼身体的习惯；三，按照学校规定的时间，每天坚持认真做好早操、课间操，参加课外体育活动每周不少于两课时。这些标准是切合广大中学生实际的，只要认真努力去做，不难达到。
