Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 3rd.

Annual Expenditure:
Money spent: 7 billion yuan
Land used: 1 million acres
Wood used: 2 million cubic meters
Excessive funeral consumption is shocking; old customs must be changed

The spokesperson for the Ministry of Civil Affairs warned today: Currently, in our country, the phenomenon of the dead competing with the living for land is severe, with annual land use for burials reaching nearly 1 million acres.

It is reported that at present, large cities, coastal provinces, Northeast China, and the Jianghan Plain have relatively good control over burial practices. The cremation rate in cities reaches 90%, and in rural areas designated for cremation, it is over 70%. Nationwide, in 1988, 1.8 million bodies were cremated, accounting for only 27% of the total number of deaths.

The practice of holding elaborate funerals is a significant social problem. Statistics show that the country spends 7 billion yuan on funeral expenses annually and consumes 2 million cubic meters of wood.

The spokesperson for the Ministry of Civil Affairs pointed out that it is necessary to strictly implement the "Provisional Regulations on Funeral Management by the State Council." It is forbidden to use arable land for graves. Public cemeteries should be built on barren hills and wastelands, and graves should not be dug along scenic areas, roads, or railways.

　　一年所耗
  　花钱：七十亿元　占地：一百万亩　用材：二百万
    殡葬消费惊人　旧俗不改不行
    本报北京４月３日讯  国家民政部发言人今天告诫：当前我国死人与活人争地现象严重，每年土葬占地近１００万亩。
    据介绍，目前大城市、沿海省份、东北和江汉平原限制土葬比较好，火化率城市达到９０％，农村火化区为７０％以上。就全国来看，１９８８年火化尸体１８０多万具，只占全国死亡总人数的２７％。
    大办丧事之风盛行，是社会一大公害。据统计，全国每年就要花去丧葬费７０亿元，消耗木材２００万立方米。
    民政部发言人指出，要坚决执行《国务院关于殡葬管理的暂行规定》，不许占用耕地造坟，要利用荒山瘠地修建公墓，不在风景区、公路、铁路两旁埋坟。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（罗同松　王旻）
