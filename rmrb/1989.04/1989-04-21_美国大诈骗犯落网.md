In the New York Wall Street securities market, Michael Milken is considered one of the biggest swindlers in American history for using various illegal means to amass wealth. Legal authorities formally filed charges against him last month.

Milken established a securities brokerage firm called "Drexel Burnham Lambert," using forged stocks and other securities, stealing confidential and insider information, and manipulating the stock market through despicable means. In just three years, he amassed over $1.1 billion in illicit gains.

Federal prosecutors listed 98 counts of fraud against him in the indictment. If each count is confirmed and proven in court, he could face a total of up to 520 years in prison, in addition to a fine of $1.85 billion for him and two accomplices. The New York Times reported that the indictment specifies that Milken defrauded $45 million in 1983; $123 million in 1984; $135 million in 1985; $294 million in 1986; and his illegal income jumped to $550 million in 1987. Over five years, he personally amassed $1.147 billion in illicit gains, enough to rank among the world's wealthiest.

Milken's initial attempts at fraud were successful, and his audacity and greed grew with each success. His insatiable desire for money ultimately led to his downfall.

Despite the enormous shock and public outrage caused by Milken's fraud case in the United States, the Newsweek reported on April 10 that he has hired numerous lawyers for his defense and has 88 friends and associates who placed a full-page advertisement in the Wall Street Journal expressing their full support for him, greatly comforting the swindler. The outcome of this lawsuit has drawn widespread attention from American newspapers.

　　美国大诈骗犯落网
    陈封
    在纽约华尔街证券交易市场中以各种非法手段大发横财的迈可·米尔肯被认为是美国有史以来最大的骗子之一。司法当局已于上月底正式对他提起公诉。
    米尔肯建立了一个称为“德里克赛”的证券经纪公司，以伪造股票和其他证券，窃取机密、内部情报及操纵股票市场等卑劣手段，在短短３年内获得超过１１亿美元的不义之财。
    联邦检察官在起诉书中列举了他的９８项诈骗罪状。如果每项罪状都经法院确认并成立，他可能被判处总计高达５２０年的监禁，另对他和两个同伙罚款１８．５亿美元。《纽约时报》说，公诉书指明米尔肯在１９８３年骗取了４５００万美元；１９８４年骗得１．２３亿美元；１９８５年捞得１．３５亿美元；１９８６年增至２．９４亿美元；１９８７年的非法收入一跃而为５．５０亿美元。５年中他个人所得赃款共计１１．４７亿美元，可跻入世界级豪富之列。
    米尔肯初试骗术即得手，以后胆量越来越大，胃口越来越壮，对金钱的贪欲无限膨胀，永远填不满，终于落入法网。
    尽管米尔肯诈骗案在美国引起了极大震动和受到舆论的咒骂，但据《新闻周刊》４月１０日报道，他不但聘请了不少律师替他辩护，还有８８位好友和关系户在《华尔街日报》上刊登整页广告表示对他全力支持，使这个骗子受到很大安慰。这场官司如何了结，美国报刊普遍表示关注。
