Friends gathered and discussed recent funeral practices, sharing some unusual experiences.

Example one: A cadre in a certain place held a funeral for his deceased mother, spending over 2,000 yuan on colored paper and bamboo strips, hiring several craftsmen to meticulously craft miniature cars, televisions, and refrigerators. On the day of the burial, these items were transported to the gravesite and burned. The cadre said, "To show a little filial piety, I hope Mother can enjoy the modern conveniences of the human world in the afterlife!"

Example two: Another cadre buried his deceased father, using cement, steel bars, sand, and bricks to construct a two-story underground house at the gravesite, complete with a bedroom, living room, and bathroom.

Example three: Someone, for the third anniversary of their deceased parents, obtained a recommendation letter from the village committee, absurdly transferring their parents' grain ration cards to the "Underworld Grain Bureau."

As children, it is natural to honor filial piety and express grief. However, some people are excessively modernizing funerals, which not only poisons people's minds and social customs but also erodes the achievements of socialist spiritual civilization. Our country has entered a modern civilized society; how can we allow these superstitious activities to spread?

### 丧事“现代化”令人忧虑

　　丧事“现代化”令人忧虑
    朋友相聚，说到办丧事都有一些新奇见闻。
    例一：某地一干部为亡母办丧事，花２０００多元购买五色彩纸和篾条等物，请数名工匠精心扎制小轿车、彩电和冰箱等。下葬那天，这些东西被运到坟地付之一炬。这位干部还说：“为儿略表孝敬寸心，请娘在九泉之下享受人间现代化之乐！”
    例二：另一干部安葬亡父，用水泥、钢筋、沙石、砖块，在坟地建造起地下二层小楼房，设有寝室、客厅、澡堂等。
    例三：某人为已故双亲做三忌年，通过村委会竟荒唐地开出介绍信，向“冥国粮食局”补转去了父母的粮食户口关系。
    为人儿女，尽孝道之心，怀悼念之情，无可厚非。但是，有些人大搞丧事“现代化”，这岂不是毒害人们的思想和社会风气，蚕食社会主义精神文明建设成果，实在令人忧虑不安。我们的国家已进入现代文明社会，岂容这些迷信活动滋生蔓延。
