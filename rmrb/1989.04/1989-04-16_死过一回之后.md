Title: After Dying Once

If I told you, "I died," you would surely think it absurd. But when I returned from the chaotic south to my small northwestern city that year, every familiar face I encountered would say with certainty, "But you... you've already... died."

The word "died" was spoken clearly. From the train station to my home, almost every step of the way, I encountered the same astonishment. Back home, my wife and children rushed to embrace me, as if we had been separated by a lifetime. My mother's eyes were still swollen from crying. The news of my death had become a reality in this small city. The south was flooded, and many people had drowned. Someone said that at a certain pier, they had seen a notice of the deceased with my name on it. What made it even more believable was that I had indeed not written a letter for two months, and the unit had sent a telegram to the relevant authorities with no response. The unit had even reported to the municipal committee, intending to send someone to search for my remains. The "local celebrity" had thus gained even more fame. Who would have thought that my careless nature, combined with the possibility of a misfortune with someone of the same name, would cause such a commotion? In reality, I hadn't even seen the flood. When the Yangtze River was overflowing, I was in a small town in northern Sichuan, chatting with friends about the night rain in the mountains.

But I had indeed experienced death. Everyone, from top to bottom and in all directions, came to visit, bringing a kind of concern for someone who had returned from the dead, making me feel as if I had truly died. Things that had always seemed so distant were suddenly brought so close. Indeed, people in this world are like bubbles on the water's surface, a mere accident or a gentle breeze could make you instantly return to your original state. If I had encountered that pier during my journey, who could say whether the rumor was true or not? Who could say whether I was supposed to die or not?

I felt a sense of desolation. My wife said, "You're back, that's good. Just in time for the recent pay raise, we can treat ourselves to a feast to calm our nerves." She also mentioned that during the pay evaluation, since I wasn't present, there was a bit of a "cold shoulder" attitude, and I almost missed out on the "40%." What she found even more puzzling was that A, who had always been close to me and often flattered me, was the most considerate this time, as if to say, "Since he might no longer be in this world, giving him a raise wouldn't be of much use." Of course, there were others who benefited. I felt even colder at the thought, so this world was like that.

I headed to the office. A was in the office, he turned around in surprise, then joyfully, he hugged me, almost shedding tears of joy. He was extremely friendly.

B was also sitting there. She stood up and said indifferently, "You're back." This woman was a novel editor, stern and taciturn, and had always seemed somewhat incompatible with me. Her husband had an unusual surname: Party, and always gave me a strong sense of "party spirit." I remembered once during a casual conversation, when discussing a certain open-minded female writer, she was very angry, and I had argued with her for a while. I thought she would be indifferent to my "disaster."

But the "small radios" told me a series of shocking things: just when my "death news" was spreading, the most anxious person was B. She sent the telegram inquiring about me, she made long-distance calls all night, and she also came to the house to comfort us. It was she who, at the pay evaluation meeting, stood up and said, "We must be fair! In the entire unit, his salary is the lowest. If we talk about 'performance,' probably no one can say he has done anything wrong. We have no basis to say he is dead—even if he is dead, he has a family of six, with five still alive! How will they live? We must have humanity in our hearts!"

The world is strange; those who are familiar make you unfamiliar, and those who are unfamiliar make you marvel. I remember reading a surreal novel where a dead person came back to life in the coffin. He carefully listened to the crying outside, and the most genuine cries were from some strangers, while his close friends were hammering nails into the coffin while plotting to take his wife and inheritance. To truly understand the world, must one die first?

Back home, I felt a bit dazed. I casually flipped open a magazine, and there was an interesting article, "How much is a person worth?" The article said that a person's body can provide enough fat to make seven or eight bars of soap, just enough lime to whitewash a small room, enough phosphorus to make twenty boxes of matches, and a little iron to make a one-inch nail. The total value is only a dozen dollars. But the article also said that if you were given these materials, you would not be able to reassemble them into a living, thinking person, even if you spent all the money in the world. A person's value lies only in being a person. But it didn't say that even among the living, there are great differences.

Suddenly, my daughter ran into the room, shouting, "Dad! This is strange! Our bell has come back!"

She was talking about the bicycle bell in the hallway downstairs. I also found it strange; it had been replaced so many times, and it had been stolen so many times. This time, how did it come back? Maybe an restless person this time had a change of heart—this family has suffered misfortune—right?

I closed my eyes, blowing smoke rings. Thinking of A, thinking of B, thinking of many people I had only come to know after my "death," thinking of that hand that stole the bell—perhaps it should be called X—these mysterious symbols of life. Yes, I had "died," truly felt a bit of the world's indifference; but fortunately, I had "died," finally giving me a new understanding of the world. It seemed that outside the window, there was a group of ants, moving on the vast ground, each with their own destination but faces blurred, even just a large patch of color. But above it, there was clearly a light, sometimes hidden, sometimes flashing, like B's beam of light, like that lovable thief X's sometimes very noble hand. It illuminates some dark souls, even brightens half the world, making such a vast group of lives slowly crawl towards a place of value.

Living is always a blessing!—I sighed—especially in feeling that light.

### 死过一回之后

　　死过一回之后
　　杨牧
    如果我对你说“我死了”，你一定会觉得这很荒唐。但那年我从兵荒马乱的南方回到我西北小城的时候，面对面一张熟悉的面孔就很肯定：“你不是已经……死了么？”
    那“死”字吐得清清楚楚。从车站到家的一段路上，几乎每走一步也都遇到同样的惊愕。回到家里妻子和孩子迎面扑来，恍如隔世，母亲的眼泡还红肿着。我的死讯于这座小城已是真真切切，南方闹洪灾一下淹死了许多人，某人说某人在某个码头，就亲见遇难的告示中有我的名字。尤其叫人确信的是，我的确两个月没有写信，单位向有关方面发去电报也无信息，甚至单位已报告市委，要派人去打寻遗体了。“小城名流”也更因此名声大噪。没有想到我生性疏忽加上可能正好有那么一个倒霉的同名者，竟造成这么大的骚乱。其实那洪水我见都没见到，长江洪浪滔天的时候，我正在川北一个小镇与一帮朋友“却话巴山夜雨时”呢。
    但我俨然是“死”过的人了，上上下下方方面面的探望者都送来一种对起死回生者的关切，也使我有了确乎死过的感觉。从来觉得很遥远的东西一下被推得这么近。委实这世界上的人，也真如水面上一些气泡，一个偶然，一阵微风都可能使你瞬息间恢复原汁状态。如果我行程中果真遇了那个码头，谁能说讹传还是讹传，谁又能说清我这次本来就不该死或者本来就该死呢？
    我悲凉起来。妻子说，回来就好了，正好新近加了工资，可阔气一顿压压惊。并且说是这次评工资我人不在，就有点“人去茶凉”的味道，“百分之四十”差点没份儿。尤其叫她不解的是，本单位Ａ君历来和我要好，平时颇为奉承我，此次却是他考虑最周，仿佛“既然他已可能不在人世，评了也没有什么用了”。当然有用的自有其人。我一听更凉到脚心，这世界，原来竟是这么回事。
    我向单位走去。Ａ君正在办公室，他回头一惊，继而大喜，热情拥抱差点没掉下满眶热泪。他友好极了。
    Ｂ女士也坐在一边。她站了起来，淡淡地说了句“回来了”。此女士是位小说编辑，板板正正，寡言少语，历来和我似不太协调。她丈夫姓了一个怪姓：党，也总给我很“党性”的感觉。我记得一次闲聊时，谈到某位开放型的女作家，她在一旁很是愤怒，我还与她争吵了一顿。想这次我的“遇难”她八成是无动于衷的。
    没想“小广播”们告诉我一串令我大惊失色的事：就在我“死讯”弥漫的时候，最急的恰是Ｂ女士。发报询问的是她，通宵达旦挂长途的是她，到家中安抚的也有她。就在那次评工资的会上，她跳了起来：“要凭良心！全单位数他工资最低，要论‘表现’，大概谁也说不出他哪儿表现不好，我们还没有任何根据说他就死了——就是死了，他一家六口还有五口活不活？怎么活？不要人在人情在！”
    这世界奇了，认识的叫你不认识，不认识的又叫你惊异。记得读过一部荒诞派的小说，就有一个死去的人，在棺材里又活过来，他仔细分辨外面的哭声，哭得最真的竟是一些陌生的声音，而他的挚友却一边挥锤击着铁钉，一边谋划夺取他的妻子和遗产。人要透彻地认识世界，莫非真要死一回才行？
    回到家里，我有些恍惚。顺手翻开一本杂志，巧有一篇小知识，《一个人到底值多少？》那小文说，人的躯体，可提出做七八块肥皂的脂肪，勉强够粉刷一间小屋子的石灰，磷可以做二十盒火柴，还有一点可以打成一根一英寸长的铁钉的铁，全部不过值十几块钱。但小文又说，如果交给你这么些原料，要你重新组合成一个有生命、有思想的人，耗尽全世界的资金也不够。人的价值，仅在“人”上。但它没说，同是活生生的人，还有什么悬殊的地方。
    突然女儿跑进屋来，大叫：“爸！真怪！我们那铃铛又回来了！”
    她说的是楼下走廊里的自行车铃铛。我也觉怪，它不知装过多少个，也不知被拧过多少个，这一回怎么去而复返了？也许有个不安份的这回也心里动了一下——这家是遭了不幸的人——吧？
    我合上眼睛，吐着烟圈。想着Ａ，想着Ｂ，想着许多我“死”后才重新发现的形象，想着那只拧铃铛的手——或者它该叫Ｘ——这些神秘的生命符号。是的，我是“死”过了，真正感受了一点炎凉；也幸而“死”过，终使我对大千世界有了一点新领悟。似乎窗外有一群蝼蚁，在博大的地面上行动着，各有去处而面孔模糊，甚至只是一大片色块。但它的上空分明还有一道光，时而隐匿，时而闪现，如同Ｂ的一道清辉，如同那位可爱的小偷Ｘ那有时又很高尚的手，它照出一些灵魂的灰暗，甚至照亮半壁世界，使偌大一个生命群体朝着一个有价值的地方缓缓爬去。
    活着，总是有幸的！——我吁了一口气——有幸尤在感受到了那道光。
