American scientists have confirmed that the mental state of a patient can enhance their immune system.

According to foreign reports, some psychologists and immunologists in the United States have jointly proven that improving a patient's mental state can strengthen their immune system. Some of their new findings include:

- A life that is not overly tense and excited helps to strengthen the immune mechanism;
- Diminishing and bravely facing some traumatic memories is beneficial to health. Research has found that some depressing events in one's personal life are directly related to the immune mechanism. Writing down things that have never been discussed with others can increase the number of T cells that kill viruses;
- Guiding cancer patients to overcome negative emotions and pessimistic thoughts, and fostering optimism can increase T cells;
- An experiment has proven that mental relaxation combined with other stress-relieving training can increase T4 cells by 10% to 14%. These cells are significantly reduced in AIDS patients.

The above new findings are early results from the integration of psychology and physiology, two previously unrelated fields. Their combination has given birth to a new discipline—psychoneuroimmunology. This field specifically explores the relationship between a person's emotional life and the fluctuations of the immune mechanism. The National Institute of Mental Health in the United States has provided funding for the above research projects.

　　美国科学家证实    
    精神状态与免疫系统关系密切
    本报讯  据外报报道，美国的一些心理学家与免疫学家的联合研究证明，病人的精神状态的改善能增强其免疫系统。
    这些科学家的新发现有以下一些：
    ——生活不过于紧张和激动有助于加强免疫机制；
    ——淡化并勇于面对一些创伤性的记忆有益于健康。研究发现，个人生活中一些沮丧的事情与免疫机制直接有关。把这种从未与人谈及的事情写出来可以增加杀伤病毒的Ｔ细胞；
    ——辅导癌症患者克服消极情绪和悲观思想、树立乐观主义能增加Ｔ细胞；
    ——有一项实验证明，精神松弛再加上别的减轻紧张的训练可增加１０％至１４％的Ｔ４细胞。而艾滋病患者身上的这种细胞明显减少。
    上述新的发现是心理学和生理学两门学科相结合的早期成果。过去这两门学科是互不相干的。两者结合产生了一门新的学科——心理免疫学。此学科专门探索人的感情生活同免疫机制起伏的关系。美国国家精神健康研究所为上述研究项目提供了经费。
