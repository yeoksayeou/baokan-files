In recent years, the schistosomiasis epidemic in the Poyang Lake area of Jiangxi Province has shown signs of resurgence. Currently, the area infested with Oncomelania snails has reached 1 million mu; the number of acute schistosomiasis patients has risen from over 300 in the mid-1970s to 2,253 in 1987; and the number of livestock infected with schistosomiasis has reached over 100,000. In Boyang County, 27 out of 49 townships are affected by schistosomiasis, with an infested area of over 230,000 mu. In this county's Lianhu Town, Juji Village, with a population of over 8,600, the infection rate of schistosomiasis is as high as 96%. Schistosomiasis has caused many young and middle-aged people to lose their ability to work, and coupled with natural disasters, the income of most farmers in the lake area has dropped below the provincial average. If this situation continues, the misfortune of "thousands of villages overgrown with weeds and human excrement, and tens of thousands of households desolate with ghosts singing songs" will once again befall the lake area!

Why has the schistosomiasis epidemic resurged? The main reasons are as follows: First, the funds for schistosomiasis control are insufficient. In the past, the provincial government allocated approximately 5.9 million yuan annually for schistosomiasis control, which was already insufficient. Later, this fund was transferred to the control of prefectures, cities, and counties, and part of the schistosomiasis control funds were diverted for other uses, making the funds even more insufficient. Second, the difficulty of snail control has increased. Nowadays, rural production is carried out by individual households, and the old method of mobilizing the masses to control snails is no longer applicable, while new methods have not been found. Additionally, some places neglect water conservancy projects, and the past experience of combining water conservancy construction with snail control is no longer useful. Third, propaganda and education have been relaxed, leading to insufficient awareness among the masses about the dangers of schistosomiasis and a lack of vigilance. Fourth, the quality of the schistosomiasis control team is poor, and the equipment is outdated.

We appeal to the relevant departments to take measures to quickly eliminate the threat of schistosomiasis in the Poyang Lake area.

### 鄱阳湖区血吸虫病疫情回升

　　鄱阳湖区血吸虫病疫情回升
    近几年来，江西鄱阳湖区血吸虫疫情又呈回升之势。目前，湖区钉螺面积已达１００万亩；血吸虫急性病人已由７０年代中期的３００多人，上升到１９８７年的２２５３人；患血吸虫的牲畜数已达１０多万头。波阳县４９个乡镇有２７个流行血吸虫病，钉螺面积达２３万多亩。这个县莲湖乡朱家村８６００多人，血吸虫病感染率高达９６％。血吸虫病使许多青壮年丧失了劳动能力，加上自然灾害，湖区大部分农民的收入降到全省水平线以下。长此下去，“千村薜荔人遗矢，万户萧疏鬼唱歌”的厄运，将重新降临湖区！
    血吸虫疫情何以回升？其主要原因是：一、血防经费短缺。过去每年由省掌握的血防经费约５９０万元，这笔款本来就不够用。后来，这笔经费改由地市县掌握，部分血防经费被挪作它用，血防经费更为短缺。二、灭螺工作难度加大。如今农村是一家一户生产，发动群众灭螺的老办法不适用了，而新办法还没有摸索出来。加之一些地方忽视兴修水利，往昔结合水利建设进行灭螺的经验也无用了。三、放松了宣传教育，使群众对血吸虫病的危害性认识不足，警惕性淡薄。四、血防队伍素质差，设备陈旧。
　　呼吁有关部门采取措施，尽快解除鄱阳湖区血吸虫病的威胁。
