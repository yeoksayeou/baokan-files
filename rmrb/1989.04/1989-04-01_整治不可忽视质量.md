	Quality Cannot Be Neglected in Rectification
	People's Daily reporter Mo Xinyuan

	"In the rectification and rectification work, we have a very worrying problem, which seems not to have received enough attention. This is the quality problem." National People's Congress representative and chairman of the Asia-Pacific Quality Management Organization Liu Yuanzhang frankly told the reporter.

	According to the sampling report of relevant national departments, the industrial product qualification rate in China in the second half of 1988 was only 72%. According to the figures released by the China Quality Management Association, the loss of industrial waste products last year amounted to 1.83 billion yuan. This is a huge waste of manpower, materials, and finances.

	Liu Yuanzhang believes that the reason for the poor quality is the lack of quality awareness. From a deeper psychological analysis, it is related to the guiding ideology of seeking quick results and one-sided pursuit of output and quantity. The current evaluation and incentive methods are also unscientific. Many quality evaluations are not about competing in quality, but about competing in means. Consumers are dissatisfied, and the credibility of the awards is declining.

	Liu Yuanzhang pointed out that from the above analysis, improving the quality level is closely related to rectification and rectification, and it does not require much investment to achieve results.

　　整治不可忽视质量
    本报记者  莫新元
    “在治理整顿工作中，我们有一个十分忧虑的问题，似乎没有引起足够的重视，这就是质量问题。”人大代表、亚太质量管理组织主席刘源张很直率地向记者这样说。
    据国家有关部门抽查公报，１９８８年下半年我国工业产品合格率仅为７２％。据中国质量管理协会公布的数字，去年全年工业废品损失金额达１８３亿元。这是人、财、物的巨大浪费。
    刘源张认为，造成质量差的原因，是质量意识淡薄。从深层心理分析，还是与指导思想上急于求成、片面追求产值产量有关。现行评比激励的方法也欠科学。不少优质评比，不是质量的竞争，而成了手段的竞争，广大消费者不满，评优威信下降。
    刘源张指出，从以上分析看，提高质量水平，与治理整顿关系密切，而且不用多大投资，就能收到效果。
