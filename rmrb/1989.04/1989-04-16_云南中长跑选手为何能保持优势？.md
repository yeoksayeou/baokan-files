The China-Japan Friendship Great Wall Marathon left a deep impression not only because of the gathering of stars in this event but also because of the strong performance of Yunnan long-distance runners. The men's team from Yunnan stood out, once again winning the championship, while the women's team that took the top spot in the national training squad included two prominent runners from Yunnan, Wang Huabi and Zhong Huandi.

Since the 1950s, Yunnan athletes have repeatedly won championships in middle and long-distance running events in China with their remarkable endurance. Many outstanding athletes have emerged, setting new Asian and national records multiple times. The enduring strength of Yunnan athletes in middle and long-distance running piqued our interest. After the competition, we interviewed the coaches of the Yunnan men's and women's teams, Su Wenren and Peng Liang, respectively.

Coaches Su and Peng explained that Yunnan athletes have maintained their leading position in middle and long-distance running in China for several reasons. First, they benefit from the unique high-altitude training environment of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, which is ideal for improving cardiovascular function. Similarly, many outstanding athletes from countries like Kenya and Ethiopia also come from high-altitude regions. Second, Kunming enjoys a spring-like climate year-round, allowing for training throughout the year. Therefore, Yunnan athletes train almost every day of the year, which has laid a solid foundation for improving their overall abilities. Third, the athletes have long careers. Many male athletes, such as Zhang Guowei, continue to perform well even after turning 30, contrasting sharply with many athletes in other sports in China who retire early.

Coaches Su and Peng mentioned that in middle and long-distance running, China still lags behind the world in several aspects. Primarily, our athletes lack speed and endurance. Additionally, our training facilities are not as good as those abroad. For example, athletes like Zhao Youfeng and Chen Qingmei, who are training in Japan, run on grass fields and cover about 1,000 kilometers per month. In contrast, Chinese athletes can only train on roads and cover only 600 to 700 kilometers. Furthermore, in terms of diet, long-distance runners should consume more alkaline foods, but in China, we are accustomed to eating more acidic foods, which makes it difficult for athletes to maintain acid-base balance during intense training.

When discussing the future of middle and long-distance running, Coaches Su and Peng said that women's middle and long-distance running in China leads in Asia, while men's running is ahead in only a few events. Achieving good results in next year's Asian Games will be our primary goal, and we are confident of making a breakthrough in this area.

### 云南中长跑选手为何能保持优势？

　　云南中长跑选手为何能保持优势？
    中日友好长城马拉松赛给人最深刻的印象不仅仅是本届比赛明星荟萃，耐人寻味的还有云南长跑运动员表现出来的强大实力。男子组云南队一支独秀，再次蝉联冠军，女子组夺魁的国家集训队中亦有王华碧、钟焕弟两员滇中名将。
    从５０年代开始，云南选手就以其惊人的耐力素质在我国中长跑项目中屡屡夺冠，他们之中，涌现出了一大批优秀的选手，曾多次刷新亚洲和全国纪录。云南运动员在中长跑项目中长久不衰的奥秘引起了我们的兴趣。在比赛结束之后，我们分别采访了云南男队教练苏文仁和女队教练彭亮。
    苏彭两位教练说，云南选手之所以能在中长跑比赛在国内一直处于领先地位，有以下几方面原因。一是得天独厚的高原训练。云贵高原，为运动员提高心肺功能提供了良好的地理环境。非洲一些国家的优秀选手，如肯尼亚、埃塞俄比亚等国的运动员，也多是来自高原国家。第二，昆明四季如春，一年四季都可以训练。因此，云南选手基本一年３６５天训练都没有停歇，这种长年系统性训练为选手提高各方面素质打下了良好的基础。三是选手运动寿命长。不少男选手，如张国伟等，年过３０，而成绩仍保持上升势头，与我国不少项目运动员过早退役形成鲜明的对比。
    苏彭两位教练谈到，田径的中长跑项目我国与世界水平相比仍存在着不小的差距，这首先与我们选手速度耐力不行有很大关系。其次训练场地亦不如国外。例如正在日本训练的赵友凤、陈青梅，平时都在草地上跑，一月训练量达１０００公里。而我国选手只能在公路上练习，训练量只有６００—７００公里。再之在饮食结构上，长跑选手应多食碱性食物，而我国习惯食偏于酸性的食物，这就给运动员在大运动量的消耗中调整酸碱平衡造成了困难。
    苏彭两位教练在展望中长跑项目前景时说，女子我国在亚洲处于领先地位，男子仅在个别项目上占优，明年的亚运会取得好成绩将是我们的首要目标，我们有信心在这一年中取得突破。
