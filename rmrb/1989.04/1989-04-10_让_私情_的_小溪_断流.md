	Let “personal favoritism” flow no more
	“If we compare ‘personal favoritism’ to a ‘small stream,’ then as the director of the Materials Bureau, I must stop its flow.” This is a phrase often used by Tian Zenglu, the director of the Materials Bureau in Quyang County, Hebei Province.

	Five years ago, when Tian Zenglu first became the director of the county Materials Bureau, he was surrounded by “noble friends,” with relatives and friends frequently coming to his door, asking him to allocate some subsidized lumber or steel bars. He, however, maintained an attitude of “friendship as pure as water,” refusing to do anything inappropriate. Gradually, his door became quiet. Most of those who were refused understood and sympathized with him, and some even respected him more, but there were also those who cut off their relationship with him.

	“Without desires, one remains upright.” Some people, after being refused by Tian Zenglu, grumbled, “Look at him, he can do without asking anyone for help!” Waiting for an opportunity to “brainwash” him. However, Tian Zenglu truly “does not ask anyone for help.” He has been a cadre for over 30 years, serving as a leader in 12 different units. He is familiar with people from all levels, but he has never asked anyone to help his spouse with the “agricultural to non-agricultural” conversion or to arrange jobs for his children. His five children: the eldest son joined the army and was promoted to an officer, the second son worked for 13 years as a temporary worker in a regional coal mine and only last year became a contract worker according to policy, and the third son and two daughters still have their household registration in the countryside.

	Once, a manager from a supply and marketing cooperative in Zhangzhou City, Fujian Province, came to Quyang to discuss business. In order to reach an agreement with the county Materials Bureau for the supply of lumber, he took the opportunity when he was alone with Tian Zenglu to hand him a letter, saying, “A small token, please accept it.” Tian Zenglu opened it to find money inside. His face immediately changed, and he returned it to him, sternly saying, “We do business by the rules. We don’t do things this way here.” After negotiations, the county Materials Bureau signed a supply contract with him on the principle of mutual benefit. The manager was moved and said to the staff of Quyang County Materials Bureau, “In some materials departments, you can’t get anything done without giving something. Your department’s practices are truly good!”

	Another time, a leader from a company under the county Materials Bureau violated financial discipline, using the excuse of buying shoes and coats for the staff to give each person 170 yuan in cash, totaling 2,720 yuan in expenses. He also asked everyone to keep it secret. This “secret” could not be kept for long and soon reached Tian Zenglu’s ears. Tian Zenglu was very angry about this and, after organizing an investigation and verification, did not show favoritism. In addition to ordering the company leader to collect the money and submit it within a deadline, he also ordered him to make a self-criticism at the staff meeting. Considering that the company leader’s attitude towards admitting his mistake was good, the bureau decided to waive punishment.

	Tian Zenglu said: “The Materials Bureau controls a lot of money and goods. If we do not strictly enforce the system and management, it is very easy to do a little trick. As the director, I must not open the door to this.”

### 让“私情”的“小溪”断流

　　让“私情”的“小溪”断流
    “假如把‘私情’比作‘小溪’的话，那我这个物资局长只好让它断流。”这是河北省曲阳县物资局长田增录常讲的一句话。
    ５年前，田增录刚当上县物资局长那一阵子，可谓“胜友如云”，常有亲戚、朋友找上门来，托他给批点平价木材、钢筋什么的，他是“君子之交淡如水”，不该办的一概不办。渐渐地，门庭冷落了。遭到拒绝的，多数人能够理解他、体谅他，有些人更尊重他，但也有些人同他断了交情。
    “无欲则刚”。有些人遭田增录拒绝后，愤愤地说：“看你就能万事不求人！”等着机会给他“洗脑子”。然而，这田增录还真的“不求人”。他当干部３０余年，在１２个单位当过领导，上上下下都熟悉，可从未找过任何人为老伴“农转非”，或为子女安插工作。他的５个孩子，大儿子参军提干，二儿子在地区煤矿当了１３年临时工，去年才按政策转为合同制工人，三儿子和两个女儿的户口仍在农村。
    一次，福建省漳州市某供销社的承包人来曲阳洽谈生意，他为了与县物资局达成木材供货协议，在同田增录见面时趁没别人在场，塞给田增录一封信，说：“一点小意思，请局长笑纳。”田增录打开一看，里面全是钱。老田的脸色马上就变了，当即退给了他，严肃地对他说：“咱做买卖要走正道，我们这里不兴这一套。”经过协商，县物资局与他本着互利的原则，签定了供货合同。这个承包人感动地对曲阳县物资局的同志说：“有些物资部门的人，你不塞点根本办不了事。你们这里的风气真好！”
    还有一次，县物资局所属公司的一位领导，违犯财经纪律，以给职工买皮鞋和大衣为名，给每个人发了１７０元现金，共计开支２７２０元。还让大家保密。这种“密”毕竟是保不住的，很快传到田增录的耳朵里。对此，田增录十分恼火，组织人员调查核实后，不徇私情，除责令该公司领导人限期将款收齐上缴外，还责令其在职工大会上作了检查。鉴于该公司领导人认错态度较好，局里才决定免于处分。
    田增录说：“物资局掌握着不少财和物，不严格制度、严格管理，搞点小动作很容易，我这个当局长的首先不能开口子。”
