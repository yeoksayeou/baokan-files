The phrase "learning is like stacking firewood, the later ones are on top" is often used. However, when faced with books that are "later" but not necessarily "better," one can't help but think of re-reading the works of past scholars. The cultural anthropology work by British scholar Bronisław Malinowski (1884-1924), consisting of the essays "Magic, Science, and Religion" and "Primitive Psychology and Myth," was published in the 1920s. Translator Li Anzhu introduced it to Chinese readers half a century ago. Now, this book is being reprinted and has aroused great interest among many readers. I think, apart from some curiosity and the fact that the reprint coincides with the current "cultural fever," the main reason is probably its academic value.

In the field of anthropology, where various schools of thought abound, Malinowski belongs to the functionalist school and is one of its key figures. According to this functional theory, Malinowski examines any social culture as a complete system composed of closely related parts; each part has its own function and plays a specific role. He believes that to understand this cultural system as a whole, one must explore it from the physiological and psychological levels of individuals within society, because every custom and religious belief arises to meet people's actual needs. Therefore, when dealing with magic, myths, religious beliefs, and all other cultural phenomena, he directly asks: what role do these behaviors, rituals, and institutions play in that society? How do they exert their influence? Why can they exert such influence? It is through pondering these questions that Malinowski constructed his famous functional theory.

Malinowski's other significant contribution to anthropology is the "participant observation" method of fieldwork. Until the late 19th century, the research materials used by Western anthropologists were mostly records from missionaries, explorers, travelers, government officials, and colonizers. Before Malinowski, Haddon had organized the Cambridge Expedition to the Western Pacific islands, becoming a pioneer in collecting firsthand data from primitive tribes, but this did not last long. Malinowski, however, expanded the tradition of long-term field investigations by anthropologists. From September 1914 to October 1918, he spent about three years in places like the Trobriand Islands in New Guinea. He lived and worked with the local residents, eating and living together. Within a year, he could speak the local language fluently and communicate with the locals. His detailed and comprehensive records of local life laid a solid foundation for his research. Even critics of the functionalist school, such as the American cultural historian Ruth Benedict, had to acknowledge his work. Malinowski's experience is also worth serious consideration by China's ethnologists and folklorists.

Last spring, before the reprint was available, news came of Mr. Li's passing. Originally, as soon as I got the sample book, I planned to visit Mr. Li in Chengdu. Unfortunately, fate did not allow it, and I missed the chance to hear his teachings in person. The passing of a sage, even if he lived to a ripe old age, is still a regrettable thing. Fortunately, his contributions will not be forgotten and will long benefit the academic community. If Mr. Li knew, he would surely be content.

### 马氏和《巫术、科学、宗教与神话》

　　马氏和《巫术、科学、宗教与神话》
　　傅信
    “学如积薪，后来居上”。可是，每当对着那些“后来”却未必“居上”的书打哈欠时，就不免动了重新翻翻前贤著作的念头。英国学者马林诺夫斯基（１８８４—１９２４）的由《巫术科学与宗教》和《原始心理与神话》两篇论文组成的文化人类学著作，成书于２０年代，译者李安宅先生把它介绍给我国读者，距今也整整半个世纪了。现在重印此书，而且引起了许多读者的浓厚兴趣。我想，除了某些猎奇心理，除了重印适逢当前“文化热”的吉日良辰这些并不稳定的因素之外，更主要的恐怕还是由于它学术上的真价值。
    在门派林立的人类学领域中，马氏属于功能学派并为其重镇。根据这种功能理论，马氏在观察任何一种社会文化时，都把它作为一个完整的、由各个密切相关的部分组成的体系来考察；体系中的每一个部分，都各司其职，起着一定作用。他认为，要了解这个文化体系整体，必须从社会中个人生理—心理的层次上去探求，因为，每一项风俗和宗教信仰的产生，全是为了满足人们的这种实际需要而出现的。所以，在涉及巫术、神话、宗教信仰等等一切文化现象时，他都要直截了当地提出，这些行为、仪式和制度在那个社会里具有什么作用？怎样发生的作用？为什么能发生这样的作用？正是在对这一系列问题的思索中，马氏构筑了他著名的功能理论。
    马氏对人类学另一个突出的贡献，是被称为“参与观察法”的田野作业方法。直到１９世纪末，西方人类学家所采用的研究资料，大多是靠传教士、探险家、旅行者、政府官员、殖民者的纪录。在马氏之前，海顿曾组织过剑桥探险队去西太平洋一些海岛考察，成为人类学家从原始部落搜集第一手资料的先驱，不过时间不长。马氏则光大了人类学家长期实地调查的传统。从１９１４年９月到１９１８年１０月，他先后在新几内亚超十连岛等地呆了约有三年。他和土著居民一同吃住，一同生活，仅仅一年，就能用一口流利的土语和当地人交谈。他对当地生活朴实无华而又翔实完备的记录，为自己的研究打下了坚实的基础。对此，连一向对功能学派学说排击最力的美国文化史学派罗卫等人，也不能不刮目相看。马氏的经验，亦值得我国的民族学与民间文学理论工作者认真对待。
    前年春上，重印本还没拿到手，却传来安宅先生去世的消息。本来，一俟拿到样书，我就打算西赴蓉城拜访李老的，惜乎缘悭一面，失去了亲聆明教的机会。哲人其萎，即便享有高龄罢，也还是令人惋惜的事。好在他的劳绩不泯，将长久嘉惠学林，先生如有知，必也无憾。
