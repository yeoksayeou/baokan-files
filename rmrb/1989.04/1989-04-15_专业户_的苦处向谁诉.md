In 1983, I raised funds to import high-quality rabbits from Henan, Hebei, Zhejiang, and Shaanxi provinces to start a family rabbit farm. By using scientific feeding methods, the rabbits grew well, and the farm thrived. My rabbit-raising experience was featured in newspapers such as the Gansu Daily, Gansu Science and Technology Daily, and Agricultural Science and Technology Information. After that, people from all over the country came to learn, visit, and interview me. From 1985 to 1986, over a year and a half, I received more than 20,000 visitors and donated over 400 high-quality rabbits to impoverished households free of charge.

Soon, the county supply and marketing cooperative issued a notice prohibiting me from selling my breeding rabbits outside the county, requiring all sales to be handled by the cooperative. However, two years passed without the cooperative purchasing a single rabbit from me, yet I dared not sell them externally. But where would the feed for my thousands of rabbits come from? I was frustrated and uncertain. Just then, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Fei Xiaotong, Provincial Party Secretary Li Ziqi, and Provincial Political Consultative Conference Chairman Zhu Xuanren and other leaders visited my home, encouraging me to make contributions in the rabbit-raising industry. Especially Fei's approachable attitude and sincere advice made a deep impression on me. Thus, I regained my spirit and planted 5 mu of feed crops (our family has a total of 8 mu of land). However, all the feed was trampled and destroyed by others grazing their livestock. I repeatedly appealed to the relevant departments, but no one paid attention.

In 1987, a French rabbit expert visited, but because I did not know how to flatter, I did not speak highly of the relevant departments in front of the visitors. Since then, no one has cared about my situation. Now, I have no choice but to take the last resort: slaughtering all the breeding rabbits and selling them as commercial rabbit meat. Because this "diligent and wealthy pioneer" has become a debt-ridden, impoverished household that cannot afford to send children to school and struggles to meet basic needs.

Specialized household, specialized household, to whom can the specialized household's plight be told?

　　“专业户”的苦处向谁诉
    １９８３年，我自筹资金，从河南、河北、浙江、陕西等地引进优良种兔，办起了家庭养兔场。由于我采用科学方法喂养，兔子长得很好，养兔场日趋兴旺。甘肃日报、甘肃科技报、农业科技与信息等报刊先后介绍了我的养兔经验。此后，全国各地来学习、参观和采访的人络绎不绝。１９８５年至１９８６年一年多时间里，我就接待了２万多人次，无偿赠给贫困户优良种兔４００多只。
    不久，县供销社给我下了一个通知，不许我养的种兔外销，全部由县供销社包销调配。但是两年多过去了，县供销社从未包销过我一只兔子，我却因此而不敢外销。可是，我饲料的上千只兔子的饲料费从哪来呢？我苦闷、彷徨，正在这时，全国政协副主席费孝通、省委书记李子奇、省政协主席朱宣人等领导同志来到我家，鼓励我在养兔事业中做出贡献。特别是费老那平易近人的态度，深切地嘱咐，更使我难忘。于是，我又振作精神，种了５亩饲料地（全家共有８亩地）。可这些饲草全被别人放牧时糟践光了。我多次上诉有关部门，无人理睬。
    １９８７年，法国养兔专家来参观时，因为我不会吹牛，没有在参观人面前为有关部门说好话，从此，再也无人过问我的情况。现在，我只好走最后一条路了，准备将全部种兔宰了作为商品兔肉处理。因为我这个“勤劳致富的先进代表”已经是一名负债累累、供不起孩子上学、难以解决温饱的贫困户了。
    专业户，专业户，专业户的苦处向谁诉？
