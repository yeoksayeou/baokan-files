Title: The "Soft Bone Disease" of Contemporary Youth

It has been reported that the cost of marriage for young people today is extremely high, especially in large cities, with some exceeding the 10,000 yuan mark, which is astonishing to hear. Regardless of whether such a consumption level matches the current state of the national economy, simply tracing the source of funds reveals an unhealthy trend: most of it comes from parents' "assistance." If this is seen as a one-time "bloodletting" by elderly parents, then the continuous "consumption" by children after marriage becomes a "protracted war" that ends only with the parents' lifespan. I believe that the enjoyment built on this is indeed the "soft bone disease" of contemporary youth, a sign of cowardice due to lack of self-confidence, a sign of shamelessness due to lack of self-respect, and a sign of degeneration due to lack of self-improvement.

China does not need to fully emulate foreign countries, but the self-reliance and self-strengthening consciousness of foreign youth can be introduced, digested, and absorbed by Chinese youth. In a commodity economy society, gaining a material foundation through competition to survive is in line with the objective laws of human society. However, the reasonable possession of personal wealth is only justified when the possessor's contribution to society is roughly equivalent to it. In other words, wealth obtained through honest labor is honorable and respectable. Any behavior that ignores objective conditions, engages in premature consumption, or unilaterally appropriates the fruits of others' labor is illegal and disgraceful.

The parents of our generation of youth are a hardworking generation. The old social system prevented their elders from enjoying retirement benefits, and their lives depended entirely on them; while the natural disasters and man-made political movements after the founding of the country not only resulted in their low income and low living standards, but also inflicted varying degrees of psychological trauma. Just as they sent off their elders, they raised their children, only to find themselves burdened with the heavy shackles of arranging marriages and supplementing living expenses for their children. For this reason, how many elderly people have endured a lifetime of coarse meals, old clothes, and hard work? How many elderly people have taken on extra shifts and odd jobs? How many elderly people have suffered from poverty, illness, and contempt... Pitifully, our aging parents, apart from silently working and dedicating their lives, what have they gained in their hurried journey?! As children, how can we bear to plunder money from their meager pockets?!

A good life should be pursued through diligent labor. Although there are many unsatisfactory aspects in real life, the overall atmosphere and the big picture are good. There is a competitive environment, a stage for showcasing talents, and conditions for becoming wealthy through honest labor, providing a place for every ambitious young person. As good children, there is no reason to suck the blood of our parents, whose strength is gradually drying up. Young friends, let us truly stand on our own feet!

### 当代青年的“软骨病”

　　当代青年的“软骨病”
　　王亚平
    报载，时下青年结婚费用居高不下，大城市青年职工尤甚，有的突破万元大关，听来令人咋舌。且不论如此消费水准与目前国民经济发展状况是否匹配，单单追寻其财源，便可看出苗头不正：其中大部分来自父母的“资助”。如果将此视为白头双亲的一次性“放血”，那么儿女婚后成年累月的“蚕食”，则成为唯父母寿限方作终了的“持久战”。我认为，建筑在这上面的享受，实在是当代青年的“软骨病”，是一种不自信的懦弱，一种不自尊的贪占，一种不自强的退化。
    中国不可以全学外国，但外国青年的自立自强意识却很可为中国青年所引进、消化、吸收。在商品经济社会中靠竞争获得生存的物质基础，以贡献换取社会财富，符合人类社会的客观规律。然而个人财富的合理占有，唯独占有者对社会做出的贡献与之大体相抵才无可指责。就是说，要以诚实劳动致富才算光荣和体面。任何不顾客观条件的超前消费、无偿剥夺和占有他人劳动所获的行为都是违法的和不光彩的。
    我们这一代青年的父母，是活得很累的一代人。旧的社会制度使他们的长辈享受不到退休福利待遇，生活全靠他们供养；而建国后客观上的自然灾害和人为的政治运动，又不仅造成了他们低收入低生活标准的现实，而且在心灵上也程度不同地蒙受了创伤。好容易送走了长辈，又把子女抚育成人，不料想又套上为子女筹办婚事、补贴生活的沉重枷锁。为此，有多少老人终年粗茶淡饭旧衣裳，有多少老人值更补差做零工，有多少老人窘困多病遭唾弃……可怜，我们年迈的双亲、他们除了默默劳作终生奉献，于匆匆旅程中又得到了什么？！作为儿女，再从他们羞涩的腰包中劫掠钱财，竟能下得了手？！
    美好生活应以勤奋的劳动去争取。现实生活中固然存在不少不尽人意之处，但总的气候、大的格局是好的，有竞争的环境，有施展才华的舞台，有通过诚实劳动走向富裕的条件，为每个志向远大的青年提供了用武之地。作为好儿好女，没有丝毫理由吮吸父母日渐枯竭的血汗。青年朋友，让我们真正自立吧！
