Why is Bidding and Contracting So Difficult?

The Zhengzhou Passenger Transport Company engaged in negotiated contracting, but the contract base was far from its actual conditions, making it difficult to unleash the company's potential and increase profits. On January 4, 1988, I wrote to Governor Cheng Weigao, appealing to introduce the competitive mechanism into the enterprise contracting management activities and to change the negotiated contracting to open bidding. I also offered to participate in the competition with a bid six times the contract base of this company and arranged 10,000 yuan as a risk deposit.

My appeal attracted the governor's attention, and the Provincial Commission for Economic System Reform and the original contracting units, Zhengzhou Municipal Finance Bureau, Municipal Economic Commission, and Municipal Transportation Bureau, were ordered to conduct an investigation. Unfortunately, these contracting units continued to use the negotiated contracting method. In the end, only the original contracting units made some revisions to the Zhengzhou Passenger Transport Company's contract.

Even so, over the past year, the number of vehicles in this company increased by an average of 21.9, but profits decreased by 105,000 yuan; the loan balance not only did not decrease as stipulated in the contract but increased by 3,066,200 yuan. The contracting units, by reducing the collection of road maintenance fees and operating fees, indirectly subsidized this company by 2,247,200 yuan, while over the past two years, this company has remitted only 309,000 yuan in profits to the state.

In contrast, in March 1988, less than 200 meters away from the Zhengzhou Passenger Transport Company, the Henan Provincial United Transport Company, which had worse operating conditions, conducted bidding and contracting. Although the bidding and contracting contract of this company was signed in May 1988, by the end of 1988, it had completed a net profit of 2 million yuan, which was more than 20 times the amount before the bidding in 1987.

The comparison between the two companies shows that enterprises need to achieve results through open bidding and introducing a competitive mechanism. Why doesn't the Zhengzhou Passenger Transport Company do this? On January 4 of this year, I again wrote to the governor, hoping to introduce the competitive mechanism into the contracting management of the Zhengzhou Passenger Transport Company as soon as possible.

### 招标承包为何如此艰难？

　　招标承包为何如此艰难？
    郑州客运公司搞谈判承包，承包基数与自身条件相距甚远，很难发挥企业的潜力和增加效益。１９８８年１月４日，我向省长程维高致函，呼吁把竞争机制引进企业承包经营活动中，要求把谈判承包变为公开招标。我并且愿以６倍于这个公司承包基数的标的参与竞争，还筹资１万元作风险抵押。
    我的呼吁引起了省长的重视，省体改委和原发包单位郑州市财政局、市经委、市交通局奉命作了调查。遗憾的是，这些发包单位仍继续沿用谈判承包的方式。最后，只是由原发包单位对郑州客运公司的承包合同作了一些修订。
    即便如此，一年来，这家公司平均车数增加２１．９辆，盈利则减少１０．５万元；贷款余额不仅没按合同规定减少下来，反而增加３０６．６２万元。发包单位以少收养路费、运营费，变相补贴给这家公司２２４．７２万元，而两年来，这家公司上缴给国家的利润仅３０．９万元。
    与此相对应的是，１９８８年３月，距郑州客运公司不到２００米，经营条件较差的河南省联运公司进行了招标承包。这家公司的招标承包合同于１９８８年５月才签订，但是，１９８８年底就完成净利润２００万元，比招标前的１９８７年增长２０多倍。
    两家公司的对比说明，企业要出效益，必须公开招标，引进竞争机制。郑州客运公司为什么不这样做呢？今年１月４日，我又投书省长，希望尽早把竞争机制引入郑州客运公司的承包经营中。
