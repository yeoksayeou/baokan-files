Title: Evaluating Excellence and Investigating Inferiority

Recently, there have been frequent discussions about product "evaluation for excellence" activities, and people have raised some objections. People hope that "evaluation for excellence" should be "genuine and practical," should be fewer but better, and should prevent excessive and indiscriminate evaluations. It is also crucial to prevent the misuse of "evaluation for excellence" for other purposes. This is very reasonable.

In my opinion, while we need to regulate "evaluation for excellence" activities, we should also strengthen "investigation of inferiority" activities. We should combine both "evaluation for excellence" and "investigation of inferiority."

The so-called "investigation of inferiority" activities refer to the national product quality supervision departments, industry management departments, and the broad masses of consumers working together in various ways and forms to identify counterfeit and inferior products, expose them, and prevent them from being passed off as genuine.

The "evaluation for excellence" activities are not entirely without value. High-quality products that are selected can bring honor to enterprises and can also gain better economic benefits. Consumers can also know which products are of high quality, making their purchasing decisions more informed. This undoubtedly helps the market competition mechanism to function. However, "evaluation for excellence" activities also have significant limitations. Some manufacturers, upon receiving the title of "high-quality product," may start to rely on their reputation, stop striving for improvement, and even see a decline in quality. Products labeled as "high-quality" may not actually be of high quality, making it easier to deceive consumers. Moreover, most goods are still in a seller's market, and high-quality products are even more scarce, often out of reach. If consumers can buy ordinary qualified products, they are often satisfied. In this situation, consumers' most practical wish is "not to be cheated" and not to be deceived by counterfeit and inferior products. We know that the more scarce and valuable a product is, the more likely it is to be mixed with fake and inferior goods, deceiving consumers. Consumers are also more likely to be easily deceived when they are desperate. Those who fake alcohol often imitate "Maotai," but not "Erguotou." During the peak sales of refrigerators, it was also the time when inferior refrigerators were most likely to appear. Therefore, in today's situation where supply and demand are significantly imbalanced, the task of preventing counterfeit and inferior products is even more prominent. If "evaluation for excellence" is helping consumers "add flowers to brocade," then "investigation of inferiority" is protecting consumers' rights with "charity in times of need."

The reason for emphasizing "investigation of inferiority" also lies in this: "evaluation for excellence" is generally a "pleasing" matter, and the organizers often gain some benefits from it. However, "investigation of inferiority" is a "offending" matter, often encountering various obstacles, and the organizers sometimes have to bear some risks—especially when encountering local or departmental protectionism.

"Investigation of inferiority" needs to accumulate more experience, gain broader support, and be done more frequently, extensively, deeply, and meticulously.

With both the honor of "evaluation for excellence" and the threat of "investigation of inferiority," our country's product quality will fully improve.

　　评优与查劣
　　彦田
    近来，人们对颇为频繁的产品“评优”活动，提出了一些异议。人们希望“评优”应该“货真价实”，应该少而精，防止过多、过滥，更要防止借“评优”搞别的名堂，这是很有道理的。
    我以为，在约束一下“评优”活动的同时，应该加强“查劣”活动。把“评优”和“查劣”两者结合起来。
    所谓“查劣”活动，就是国家产品质量监督部门、业务主管部门、广大消费者，几方面以各种方式、各种形式，把伪劣产品清查出来，并把它示众，使它们再不能鱼目混珠。
    “评优”活动并非完全没有作用。质量好的产品被评选出来，这对企业是个荣誉，并可以由此获得较好的经济效益；广大消费者也可以知道哪些是优质产品，在选购的时候，心里更有底儿了。这无疑有利于市场的竞争机制发挥作用。但是“评优”活动也有它很大的局限。有的厂家获得优质产品的称号之时，也就是开始吃牌子，不求上进甚至质量下降之日。打着“优质产品”的产品，实际并不优质，这就更容易懵人。再者，现在大多数商品仍然是卖方市场，优质产品更加紧俏，往往只是可望不可及，难以买到，如果能买到一般的合格品，消费者常常就心满意足了。
    在这种情况下，消费者最实际的愿望就是“不要上当”，不要被伪劣商品所欺骗。我们知道，越是紧俏商品，越是名贵商品，就越容易有假货、劣货乘机混杂其间，欺骗消费者。消费者也很容易“饥不择食”，受骗上当。作假酒者，多假冒“茅台”，而没有冒充“二锅头”的；电冰箱最抢手的时候，也就是劣质电冰箱最容易出笼的时候。因此，在今天供需矛盾比较大的情况下，防止伪劣产品的任务就更加显得突出。如果说“评优”是帮助消费者“锦上添花”的话，那么“查劣”就是维护消费者权益的“雪中送炭”。
    之所以需要强调“查劣”，还有这样一层意思：“评优”一般说是“讨好”的事情，主持者也往往从中得到一些好处。而“查劣”则是“得罪人”的事情，不仅会遇到种种阻力，主持者有时还要担些风险——特别是遇到地方或部门保护主义的时候。
    “查劣”需要积累更多的经验，需要得到更广泛的支持，需要做得更经常、更广泛、更深入、更细致。
    既有“评优”的荣誉鼓励，又有“查劣”的惩罚威胁，两头一挤，我国产品质量才会全面提高。
