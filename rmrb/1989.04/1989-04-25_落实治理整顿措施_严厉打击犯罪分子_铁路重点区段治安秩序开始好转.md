Since the beginning of this year, theft, looting of transported goods, dismantling and stealing of railway facilities and equipment, robbery, pickpocketing, and hooliganism have been rampant in some stations, trains, and sections. Some criminals, in broad daylight, gang up with weapons to loot train carriages and brazenly rob passengers' belongings. Hooligans board trains in groups to pick fights, engage in brawls, and even injure people. Some even abduct female passengers and train crew members, forcing them off the train to rape and gang-rape them.

In response to the multiple important instructions from central and State Council leaders on railway public security work, various levels of railway public security organs have severely cracked down on criminal elements operating on the railways, achieving certain results.

The party and government leaders of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan provinces have tightly grasped the rectification and regulation of the Chengkun, Guikun, and Chuanqian lines. Hu Kehui, a member of the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee and the political and legal affairs secretary, has repeatedly conducted on-site inspections in key sections, studied and implemented rectification measures, and checked the rectification situation. During the rectification, a total of more than 2,600 criminal elements of various types were apprehended, and 70 criminal gangs were dismantled. A number of major cases were successively solved. Currently, the public order in these three sections has improved. The stations and trains on the Tonglin and Suijia lines have long been in a state of disorder. To address this, the Heilongjiang Provincial Government organized a joint rectification effort involving the railway and local governments and public security organs, solving 1,093 criminal cases and apprehending 1,794 criminal elements. Currently, the public order in these two sections has stabilized.

While vigorously rectifying and regulating the public order in seven key sections, the railway authorities have also focused on rectifying 115 pairs of passenger trains, 154 stations, and 76 sections with poor public order.

Through concentrated strikes and rectification and regulation, the chaotic situation in railway public order has been controlled and is improving.

To further rectify railway public order and focus on cracking down on serious criminal activities on passenger trains, the Public Security Bureau of the Ministry of Railways recently decided to take decisive measures to continue to vigorously carry out rectification and regulation work. By striking at ongoing crimes, it aims to ensure the safety and smooth operation of railway transportation.
