Fushun Postal Bureau Launches New Service: Paying Pensions for Retired Workers

According to Xinhua News Agency, Stenyang, April 29 (Reporter Ma Yi) The Fushun Postal Bureau in Liaoning Province launched a service last year to pay pensions for retired workers, which has been well-received.

The New Fushun Steel Plant, which has over 2,000 retired workers, previously needed about 10 days to distribute pensions to this group. Now, they only need to transfer the total pension amount to the postal bureau each month. The postal bureau will then notify the retired workers to collect their pensions from the nearest postal office. This way, the factory not only saves time but also reduces administrative costs.

　　抚顺市邮政局新业务：   
    为离退休职工代发工资
    据新华社沈阳４月２９日电（记者马义）辽宁省抚顺市邮政局于去年开办的为离退休职工代发工资业务深受欢迎。
    有２０００多离退休职工的新抚钢厂，过去为发这部分人的工资，要花１０来天时间。而现在他们只需按月将离退休职工的工资总额转到邮局就行了，邮局会向离退休职工发通知，让他们到附近邮局支取。这样工厂不仅省了事，还减少了费用支出。
