Taiwan will send a delegation to the 22nd annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to be held in Beijing from May 4 to 6.

According to a report from Taipei on April 7, the Taiwanese authorities decided yesterday to send a delegation to the ADB annual meeting in Beijing. The delegation, as approved by the Taiwanese authorities, will include ADB Taiwan Director Guo Wanhong, Deputy Director Xue Yiqin, Acting Deputy Director Xie Senzhong, as well as six advisors and three secretaries. Guo Wanhong will serve as the delegation leader.

A spokesperson from the relevant Taiwanese department stated that the delegation's mission to Beijing is limited to attending the ADB annual meeting and thus does not conflict with the Taiwanese authorities' "three noes" policy towards the mainland.

　　台湾将派团参加亚行北京年会
    新华社香港４月７日  电据台北消息：台湾当局昨天决定将派团参加５月４日至６日在北京举办的亚洲开发银行第２２届年会。 
    台湾当局核定的出席亚行年会代表团成员包括亚行台湾理事郭婉容，副理事薛毓麒，临时副理事谢森中，以及６名顾问和３名秘书。郭婉容担任代表团团长。
    台湾有关部门发言人称，代表团到北京的任务仅限于出席亚行年会，因此与台湾当局对大陆的“三不政策”不相抵触。
