**Editor's Note**

Since last year, the trend of rural house construction has heated up again. From the readers' letters selected here, it can be seen that many farmers, regardless of their economic capabilities, blindly raise the standards for house construction. Knowing that the cost of building a house exceeds their income and savings, they still borrow money from everywhere to incur debts. Some people even think that with the continuous rise in the prices of building materials, it is better to build a house now rather than later. There are even cases where newly built houses are demolished to rebuild high-standard new houses. It is hoped that relevant departments will pay attention to this phenomenon of overconsumption in rural areas, correctly guide farmers' consumption, and educate them to use their funds to expand agricultural production, so as to achieve greater prosperity.

**Rural Blind Construction of Houses Causes Concern**

In 1988, 1.54 million households in our county newly built or renovated 39,000 rooms, with a total construction area of 1.69 million square meters. So far, 69,600 households in the entire county have newly built or renovated houses, with a per capita living area of 28.6 square meters, nearly doubling the figure from 1978. This is a joyful development. The rural house-building boom has driven the development of the building materials industry in the entire county, with building materials factories increasing from 9 in 1978 to 113 in 1988, with a total output value of 88 million yuan, an increase of 21 times compared to 1978. However, the rural house-building boom has brought some worrying problems:

1. Farmers' investment in house construction has increased, leading to a decrease in agricultural production investment. According to a survey of 100 households, from 1985 to 1988, the per capita net income of these farmers increased by 260.4 yuan, while the per capita housing expenditure was 380.5 yuan, which affected the investment in agriculture.

2. Some households, regardless of their economic capabilities, have built houses and fallen back into poverty. Among 100 households that built houses, 87 households owed 243,000 yuan, with an average debt of 2,793 yuan per household, and some owed more than 10,000 yuan.

3. House construction lacks unified planning, and the phenomenon of occupying arable land is serious. According to the investigation by relevant departments, since May 1982, 6,659 cases of farmers illegally occupying land have been found in the entire county, with a total of 3,241 mu of arable land being illegally occupied.

4. The quality of some newly built houses is poor, laying hidden dangers. Some houses have unreasonable designs, low utilization rates, and great waste. Some houses have poor construction quality, and farmers have to demolish or renovate them after living in them for one or two years.

5. There is a serious phenomenon of extravagance and waste in house construction. Currently, rural house construction has three main focuses: First, superstition. When starting construction, they invite "feng shui masters" to choose an auspicious day. Second, feasting. When the new house is completed, the builder holds a grand banquet, spending hundreds to thousands of yuan. Third, giving gifts. According to a survey of 100 households that built houses, a total of 4,357 households gave them gifts, with a total gift value of 98,426 yuan. This not only pollutes social customs but also increases the economic burden on farmers.

### 农村盲目建房令人忧

　　编者按
    去年以来，农村建房热再度升温，从这里选登的一组读者来信可以看出：不少农民不顾自己的经济实力，盲目提高建房标准，明知建房支出超过自己的收入和积蓄，宁愿到处借钱负债一些人还认为，现在建筑材料不断上涨，晚建房不如早建房。甚至出现了拆掉刚建不久的房屋重建高标准新房的情况。希望有关部门关注农村这种超前消费现象，正确引导农民的消费，教育他把资金用于扩大农业再生产，以实现更大程度的富裕。
　　农村盲目建房令人忧
    １９８８年，我县有１．５４万农户新建、改建住房３．９万多间，建筑面积１６９万平方米。到目前为止，全县已有６．９６万农户新建、改建了住房，人均居住面积２８．６平方米，比１９７８年前增长近一倍。这是令人欣喜的。农村的建房热，推动了全县建材行业的发展，建材厂家由１９７８年的９家发展到１９８８年的１１３家，产值达８８００多万元，比１９７８年增长２１倍。然而，农村的建房热带来了一些令人忧虑的问题：
    一、农民建房投资增多，导致农业生产投入减少。据对１００户农民抽样调查发现：１９８５年至１９８８年，这些农民人均纯收入增加２６０．４元，而房支出人均为３８０．５元，由此影响了对农业的投入。
    二、部分农户不顾经济实力建房，重新陷入贫困。百个建房户中，有８７户欠债２４．３万元，每户平均欠债２７９３元，有的欠债上万元。
    三、建房缺乏统一规划，占用耕地现象严重。据有关部门调查，从１９８２年５月以来，全县查出农户违法占地案件６６５９起，滥占耕地面积３２４１亩。
    四、部分农户新房质量差，埋下新的隐患。有些房子设计不合理，使用率低、浪费大。有的住房建筑质量差，农户住上一二年就要拆除或翻修。
    五、建房中铺张浪费现象严重。目前农村建房有三种讲究：一讲迷信。破土动工要请“阴阳先生”，择“黄道吉日”，看“风水”。二讲吃喝。在新房成时，建房户要大操大办，少则几百元，多则几千元。三讲送人情。据建房的百户调查，共有４３５７户给他们送了礼，礼金总额为９８４２６元。不仅污染了社会风气，还加重了农民的经济负担。
