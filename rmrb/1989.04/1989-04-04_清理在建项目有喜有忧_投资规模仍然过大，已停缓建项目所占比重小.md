Title: Cleaning Up Ongoing Projects: Both Successes and Concerns

The situation regarding the nationwide cleanup of fixed asset investment projects is a mix of successes and concerns. Recent information and materials show four key points: “Both Successes and Concerns.”

First Success: By the end of January, nearly 20,000 projects nationwide have been halted or slowed down, reducing the investment scale by over 50 billion yuan.

Second Success: Many regions have now gotten a clear picture of the scale of their ongoing investments. Previously, when it was said that the construction scale was too large, many people found it abstract and hard to believe. Now, it is clear. Shanghai has over 8,400 ongoing projects with an investment scale of over 44 billion yuan; Sichuan Province has over 11,000 ongoing projects with an investment scale of nearly 35 billion yuan; Shandong Province has even more, with over 15,000 ongoing projects and an investment scale of 44 billion yuan; Guangdong Province (excluding Guangzhou and Shenzhen) also has nearly 9,000 ongoing projects with an investment scale of 42 billion yuan; ... In one province, with three to five hundred billion yuan in investment scale, how can it not be reduced? The comrades in Foshan, Guangdong, originally thought the scale of ongoing projects would not exceed 30 billion yuan, but after initial cleanup, the actual scale turned out to be 72 billion yuan, more than doubling. They said, after the shock, “it feels like taking a dose of cooling medicine.”

Third Success: Some regions have identified the causes of investment scale inflation and begun treatment. Shandong Province had a state-issued local project investment plan of 13.2 billion yuan in 1988, but the actual completion was 21 billion yuan. After cleanup and analysis, they found the causes to be numerous, including decentralization of approval authority leading to multiple departments and heads approving projects; layer-by-layer breakdown of investment scales resulting in layer-by-layer increases; collective and individual investments below the county level being basically out of control; lack of strict control over self-raised funds, bank loans, and issuance of construction bonds; and deliberate underestimation of design estimates, project fragmentation to avoid scrutiny, and lack of timely investigation, among others.

The concerning issues are:

First Concern: The current investment scale is still too large. For example, Shanghai’s ongoing local projects have an investment scale of 245 billion yuan still needed after completing 202 billion yuan in 1988; Guangdong’s ongoing projects (excluding Guangzhou and Shenzhen) need 223 billion yuan after completing 200 billion yuan in 1988; Sichuan’s ongoing projects need 194 billion yuan after completing 162 billion yuan in 1988; Tianjin and Fujian’s ongoing projects need 61 billion yuan and 81 billion yuan respectively to be fully completed. Further reduction is difficult without more stringent measures.

Second Concern: The proportion of halted or slowed projects in reducing the investment scale is small, with a large number of ongoing projects still within the planned “cage.” It is understood that Hubei’s reduced investment scale only accounts for 4.5% of the required investment scale, Anhui is at 5.9%, and Dalian is at 4.7%. After the state issued the investment plan “cage” for this year to various regions, most regions’ ongoing projects could not all fit into the “cage,” and it is impossible for all to enter the “cage.”

Third Concern: What to do with “orders not being followed and prohibitions not being stopped”? The central, provincial, and municipal governments have repeatedly emphasized the need to consider the overall situation and enforce orders. However, some construction units and project management departments still ignore these directives and act as they please. There are those who “run red lights,” and even more who rush to complete projects. People hope that relevant departments, especially project management units, will address these issues.

### 清理在建项目有喜有忧  投资规模仍然过大，已停缓建项目所占比重小

　　清理在建项目有喜有忧
    投资规模仍然过大，已停缓建项目所占比重小
    本报讯  记者鲁牧综述：全国固定资产投资项目清理情势如何？新近获得的情况、材料显示４个大字：“有喜有忧”。
    一喜：截至元月底，全国停缓建近２万个项目，压缩投资规模５００多亿元。
    二喜：许多地区基本摸清了在建投资规模的底数。过去说建设规模过大，不少人总觉得很抽象，甚至不大相信。而今具体了。上海市具一定规模的在建项目有８４００多个，投资规模４４０多亿元；四川省在建项目多达１．１万多个，投资规模近３５０多亿元；山东省在建项目更多，达１．５万多个，投资规模４４０多亿元；广东省（不含广州、深圳）在建项目也近９０００个，投资规模４２０多亿元；……一个省，三五百亿，投资规模这么大，不压缩怎么行呢？广东佛山市同志原以为在建规模最多不超过３０多亿元，经初步清理，实际规模却为７２亿元，增加１倍多。他们说，吃一惊之余，“犹似服了一包清凉剂”。
    三喜：一些地区注意找出投资规模膨胀的病因，开始进行治疗处方。山东省去年国家下达地方项目投资计划１３２亿元，实际完成２１０亿元。经过清理、分析，找出原因不下七八条之多。诸如计划审批权下放，存在多部门、多头审批；投资规模层层切块下达，形成层层加码；乡以下集体、个体投资处于基本失控状态；自筹资金、银行信贷、发行建设债券掌握不严；还有人为地压低设计概算，肢解项目，躲避审查，而又未及时查处，等等。
    存在令人忧虑的问题是：
    一忧：目前投资规模仍然过大。例如上海在建地方项目投资规模，去年已完成２０２亿元，全部建成尚需２４５亿元；广东不含广州、深圳在建项目投资规模，去年已完成２００亿元，全部建成还需要２２３亿元；四川在建项目投资规模，去年已完成１６２亿元，全部建成则还要１９４亿元；天津、福建在建项目要全部完成，分别也需６１亿和８１亿元，等等。继续压缩，不采取更有力的硬措施，实难奏效。
    二忧：已停缓项目中压缩在建投资规模所占比重小，一大批在建项目用在计划“笼子”。据了解，湖北已压缩的投资规模只占需投资规模４．５％，安徽也只有５．９％，大连只有４．７％。国家给各地区的今年投资计划“笼子”下达后，绝大多数地区在建项目未能全部装进“笼”内，也不可能全部入“笼”。
    三忧：“令仍不行、禁仍不止”咋办？中央、省市三令五申顾全大局，令行禁止。然而，有些建设单位、项目主管部门依然置若罔闻，我行我素。“闯红灯”者有之，突击抢工者更不在少数。人们期望有关部门特别是项目主管单位，对这些现象出来管管。
