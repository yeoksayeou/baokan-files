Title: Memories of the Little Garden

About thirty to forty meters from my grandmother's house, there was a small garden. The garden was not large, roughly about three mu, and inside, apart from five cherry trees of similar height, there was a row of lush medicinal herbs. At that time, no one had the leisure to give it a poetic name or wish for good fortune; it was simply called the little garden.

At that time, I was still young and naive. My parents sent me to the countryside and then went about their own business. Years passed, and I never asked my grandmother who had worked to obtain that piece of land, or who had planted those five trees, and when. This indeed became a regret in my life. I only remember that every year, my grandmother was always busy, either loosening the soil and fertilizing, or treating pests and watering, pouring all her late-life energy and hopes into it. No wonder the neighbors said that my grandmother's cherries were large, fleshy, and tasted better than anyone else's.

In spring, clusters of bright red cherries would be picked from the trees, shiny and translucent, the most adorable sight. At this time, my grandmother would be overjoyed, often instructing my two uncles to fill baskets with the cherries, covering them with green leaves, and then she would lead me to distribute them to the neighbors to taste. After all the cherries were given away, my grandmother would lean back in her wicker chair, her right hand resting on her forehead, her face filled with a satisfied expression. It has been many years since my grandmother passed away, but that pure and simple countryside air has left a deep impression on me.

Perhaps it is a rethinking of why people live, but in recent years, my two uncles, apart from working hard to make money, have been deeply engrossed in the little garden. They have a small house surrounded by green bamboo, and they have also bought a color TV, a refrigerator, and other things. In short, they "want to have everything that a few people in the city have." However, they have been arguing over the three mu of land and the five trees, causing a rift between the brothers, with frowns and cold stares. The land has been divided, with each family getting one mu and five fen; the trees have been divided into four, but the remaining one has caused them trouble, because no one wants to give up even a blade of grass or a twig. One uncle said to divide it by the main trunk, splitting it in half; another uncle said to count the branches, matching long and short; one uncle said to divide the fruits by weight, another uncle said to sell the tree and divide the money. They each held their ground, unwilling to compromise, unwilling to give up even a fraction of an inch.

One year passed, two years passed... The cherry tree has lost its former glory, battered and unrecognizable. After several pest infestations and frosts, the fruits became fewer, smaller, and more sour. However, the tree has not been divided yet.

　　小园追记
    唐寿银
    距离奶奶家门前三四十米远近的地方，有一片小园子，园子不大，差不多三分地左右，里面除了五棵高矮相差不大的樱桃树外，就是一溜儿茂盛的草药了。那时候，一人家谁也没有雅兴给它取一个芳名，图个吉利什么的，只是随便地管它叫小园子。
    那会儿我还小，不懂事，父母把我送到乡下，便忙他们的去了。几年过去了，我从来没有去问过奶奶，那片小园子究竟是谁挣下来的，那五棵树儿是何年何月何人所植的，这的确铸成了人生的一件憾事。只记得奶奶每年总是忙呀忙的，不是给它松土施肥，就是治虫浇水，把晚年的精力和希望全都付了出去，怪不得邻里都说奶奶家的樱桃粒大肉厚、味道胜人家的一筹呢。
    到了春上，一嘟噜一嘟噜红扑扑的果儿，从树上摘了下来，晶莹剔透，最是可爱。这时候，奶奶乐颠颠的，不时吩咐两个叔叔用篮子装好果儿，把绿叶儿盖上，自己就领着我，把全部果儿分送了邻里尝鲜。等到把果子分散完毕回来，奶奶便斜躺在藤椅上，右手加额，脸纹里注满了欣慰的神情。算来奶奶已作古多年了，可是那缕清醇的乡风，却给我留下了深刻的印象。
    也许是对人为什么而活着的重新认识吧，最近几年，两个叔叔除了拚了命赚钱外，就是一门心思琢磨小园子。他们有绿竹掩映的小楼，还添置了彩电、冰箱什么的。总之，他们“要拥有城市少数人拥有的一切”。然而，他们却为三分地、五棵树闹得兄弟不和，横眉冷对了。地是分了，是按各家一分五厘分的；树呢，分了四棵，剩下一棵却叫他们犯了难，因为，谁也不让谁多分得一草一木。一个叔叔说，以主杆为界，对半平分，一个叔叔说，数数一共多少枝，长短搭配；一个叔叔说论斤分果子，一个叔叔说卖树子分钱。他们各执一词，互不相让，谁也舍不得放弃可以进得的一分一厘。
    一年过去了，两年过去了……。那棵樱桃树已经失去了昔日的风光，被折腾得不像样子了。几经虫蚀，几度霜欺，果子结得少了，小了，也变得酸了，但是，那棵树儿仍然没有分下去。
