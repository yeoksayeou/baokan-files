Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 8th.

	The capital held an academic symposium to commemorate the May Fourth Movement. Hu Sheng, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Director of the Central Party History Research Office, said today that the development of Marxism in any country goes through a process from infancy to maturity. Today, as we commemorate the May Fourth Movement, we should affirm the tremendous influence of Marxism on the Chinese revolution, but we should not deny the immaturity of the early Chinese Communists in accepting Marxism.

	He said that this immaturity mainly manifested in the fact that early Chinese Marxists did not have the time to conduct a comprehensive and in-depth study of Marxist theory before immediately engaging in the practical struggle against imperialism and feudalism. They could only grasp the most useful elements, so their theoretical preparation was insufficient, and their theoretical level was not high. The mistakes in our guiding ideology for socialist construction after the founding of the nation are also a manifestation of a low theoretical level.

	More than 80 experts and scholars from the capital's theoretical, historical, and journalistic circles today discussed and explored a series of hot research topics related to the May Fourth New Culture Movement, aiming to carry forward the spirit of democracy and science of the May Fourth Movement, emancipate the mind, and seek truth from facts.

	The academic symposium to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement held in the Great Hall of the People was jointly initiated and organized by the Central Party History Research Office, the National Communist Party History Research Association, and the Beijing Municipal Communist Party History Research Association. Its theme is: The May Fourth Movement and Marxism.

	Hu Sheng said at the symposium that today, as we commemorate the May Fourth Movement, we should summarize historical experiences, seriously draw on those experiences that have become the past but can still exert a great cohesive force today, and better serve the realization of modernization.

	Many scholars in their speeches believed that the view of completely excluding the spread of Marxism from the May Fourth New Culture Movement is unscientific.

　　首都举行纪念“五四”学术座谈会
    胡绳说不否认我党在开始接受马克思主义时的幼稚
    建国后对建设指导思想失误也是理论水平不高表现
    据新华社北京４月８日电  （记者张宿堂）全国政协副主席、中共中央党史研究室主任胡绳今天在这里说，马克思主义在任何国家的发展都经历过一个从幼稚到成熟的过程。我们今天纪念“五四”既要肯定马克思主义对中国革命的巨大影响，也不否认中国共产党人在开始接受马克思主义时的幼稚。
    他说，这种幼稚主要表现在中国早期马克思主义者来不及对马克思主义理论作全面、深入的研究，就立即投入到反帝、反封建的斗争实践，只能抓住最有用的东西，所以理论准备不足，理论水平不高。建国后我们对社会主义建设指导思想的失误也是理论水平不高的表现。
    ８０多位首都理论界、史学界、新闻界的专家、学者今天就“五四”新文化运动中一系列热门研究话题进行座谈、探讨，以期发扬五四运动的民主、科学精神，解放思想，实事求是。
    在人民大会堂举行的这个纪念“五四”运动七十周年学术座谈会，是由中央党史研究室、全国中共党史研究会、北京市中共党史学会共同发起组织的。其主题是：五四运动与马克思主义。
    胡绳在座谈会上说，我们今天纪念五四，就是要总结历史经验，根据中国现在所处的环境认真吸取那些已成为过去，但对今天仍能产生巨大凝聚力的经验，更好地为实现现代化服务。
    许多学者在发言中，认为那种把马克思主义的传播完全排除在“五四”新文化运动之外的观点是不科学的。
