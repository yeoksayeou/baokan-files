Photographic art—does it need or have individuality? Abstractly speaking, everyone acknowledges that any art should develop its strengths and maintain its individual advantages. However, whenever the individuality of photographic art is concretely discussed, contradictions arise. Some people, while emphasizing the commonalities of art and creation, completely forget about the individuality of photographic art.

Seven or eight years ago, when the idea of mobilizing a few elementary school students to "hide" in the restroom to smoke, creating the work "Save the Children," emerged, it was also the time when some commentators challenged the basic characteristic of photographic art—its documentary nature. They believed that this documentary nature "restricted photographic art creation" and advocated that "photographic creation can imitate the creative methods used by other arts." They further elaborated: "As long as it can produce an artistic work, you can do whatever you want."

These viewpoints cannot withstand scrutiny. Just as making a mime actor speak or sing on stage would negate the existence of mime itself, the same logic applies here.

Since then, the theory and practice of "doing whatever you want" have become increasingly rampant: in the front lines of Laoshan, the work "The Last Kiss," featuring two performers from a cultural troupe playing the roles of a wounded soldier and a nurse, was released; the work "Night After Night Waiting for the Son's Return," which arbitrarily moves props around, won an award. Although the aforementioned works are the authors' attempts to emphasize weaknesses and discard strengths, moving towards the direction of "stage photography" (good stage photography is indeed an art form, but it ultimately depends on other arts), they are still within the realm of photography. As for "The Sun and Man," the people are drawn by a foreigner, and the sun is created through darkroom techniques. Such "doing whatever you want" completely destroys the individuality of photographic art.

It cannot be denied that there are commonalities among various arts. Otherwise, there would be no overall value or individual value. However, the following points should be noted.

Truthfulness is a common issue in all arts. Truth is the lifeblood of art; even for arts that primarily use fiction as a creative method, fabrication is a major taboo. The documentary creation of photographic art is even more distinct from other arts in its individuality.

Imagery and typicality are the second common issue in all arts. The typical images of other arts are achieved through "arrangement"; while the visible typicality of documentary photography is uniquely possessed by the essence of photographic art.

The commonalities in the art realm are constituted by the individualities of various art forms. Without individuality, there is no commonality. Only by grasping dialectical thinking can the borrowing and penetration between art forms not degenerate into low-level imitation or deceitful plagiarism.

　　摄影艺术的个性
　　葛新德
    摄影艺术要不要、有没有个性？抽象地讲大家都承认任何艺术都应该发挥它的特长，保持个性优势。但是，每当把摄影艺术个性具体化的时候，矛盾就跳了出来。有人在大谈艺术共性和创作共性的时候，却将摄影艺术的个性忘得一干二净。
    七、八年前，当出现动员几个小学生“躲”进厕所抽烟、创作出《救救孩子》的时刻，也正是一些论者对摄影艺术的基本特征——纪实性——提出挑战的时候。他们认为：就是这个纪实性“束缚了摄影艺术创作”；主张“其它艺术使用的创作手段，摄影创作都可以效法”。还进一步阐述：只要能拍出艺术作品，“想怎么整，就怎么整”。
    这些观点，是经不住推敲的。正像让哑剧演员在舞台上说话或唱歌，哑剧本身也就不存在了。
    自那以后，“想怎么整，就怎么整”的理论与实践，越演越烈：在老山前线，请两名文工团员分别扮演伤员和女护士的《死吻》出台了；东拉西扯、随意调动“道具”的《夜夜盼儿归》获奖了。上述作品，虽是作者们扬短弃长地在向“剧照”（拍得好的剧照虽然也是艺术品，但它毕竟依附于其它艺术）的方向努力，总还是在摄影。至于《太阳与人》，人是外国人画的画，太阳靠暗房工艺，如此“想怎么整，就怎么整”，完全破坏了摄影艺术的个性。
    不可否认，各门艺术之间是存在共性联系的。否则，便没有其总体与各自的价值，但也应注意以下几点。
    真实性，是一切艺术的共性问题之一。真实乃艺术之生命，胡编乱造即便对以虚构为主要创作手段的艺术门类亦为大忌；而摄影艺术的纪实性创作，更是区别于其它艺术的个性。
    形象性和典型性，是一切艺术的共性问题之二。其它艺术的典型形象，是通过“撮合”实现的；而纪实的可视典型，则是摄影艺术本体个性所独有。
    艺术领域里的共性，是诸多艺术门类的个性构成的，无个性即无共性。只有把握了辩证的思维，艺术门类之间的借鉴、渗透，才不致蜕变成低能的模仿或欺世的抄袭。
