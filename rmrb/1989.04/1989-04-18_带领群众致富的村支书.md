The village of Dujiagou in our town is located on the banks of the Han River and has abundant sand and stone resources. Three years ago, the Communist Party member Wen Mingjie utilized the local sand and stone resources to personally establish a precast concrete component processing plant, earning a net income of over 10,000 yuan annually.

Last July, our town's Party Committee decided, after discussion, to appoint Wen Mingjie as the village Party branch secretary. The village's Party members also unanimously recommended him. If Wen Mingjie were to take on the role of village Party branch secretary, he would only receive a 960 yuan annual subsidy and would lose the opportunity to earn over 10,000 yuan annually. However, Wen Mingjie persuaded his wife and family and decided to take on the role of village Party branch secretary.

After taking on the role of village Party branch secretary, Wen Mingjie led the masses to fully utilize the local sand and stone resources, establishing, consolidating, and developing 20 precast concrete component processing plants across the village. He organized the villagers to mine and transport sand and stone during the off-season. Last year, the village's per capita net income reached over 800 yuan.

　　带领群众致富的村支书
    我镇杜家河村位于汉江河畔，有着丰富的沙石资源。３年前，这个村的共产党员文明杰利用本地的沙石资源，个人开办了一个水泥预制构件加工厂，每年纯收入１万多元。
    去年７月，我镇党委研究决定，让文明杰担任村党支部书记，村里的党员也一致推荐他。如果文明杰任村党支部书记，每年只有９６０元补贴，还将失去每年１万多元收入的机会。但是文明杰做通了妻子及家人的工作，决定担任村党支部书记。
    文明杰担任村党支部书记后，带领群众充分利用本地沙石资源，先后在全村新办、巩固、发展了２０个水泥预制构件加工厂，组织村民在农闲季节下河开采、运销沙石。去年，全村人均纯收入达８００多元。
