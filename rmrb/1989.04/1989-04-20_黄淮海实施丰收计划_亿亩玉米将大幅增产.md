The Ministry of Agriculture has recently decided to launch the "Billion Mu Corn Bumper Harvest Plan" in the Yellow-Huai-Hai Plain as a special project under the national "Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Fishery Bumper Harvest Plan."

The participating regions include all of Hebei Province, Henan Province, Shandong Province, Beijing Municipality, Tianjin Municipality, as well as the northern parts of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces. The total area involved is one billion mu. Specifically, Hebei has 270 million mu, Henan has 270 million mu, Shandong has 320 million mu, Beijing has 30 million mu, Tianjin has 20 million mu, Jiangsu has 60 million mu, and Anhui has 30 million mu. This initiative aims to increase corn production by a total of 5 billion jin over three years. For 1989, the goal is to achieve an average increase of 15 jin per mu compared to the average of the previous three years, resulting in an additional 1.5 billion jin of corn.

To support this initiative, the Ministry of Agriculture will allocate 200,000 yuan this year and require each participating unit to match this amount with a 1:10 ratio from their own funds. The funds will be primarily used for technical training, demonstration of new technologies, and the publication of technical materials.

The management and verification of this special project will follow the "Interim Measures for the Implementation of the Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Fishery Bumper Harvest Plan" and the "Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Fishery Bumper Harvest Award Measures." Awards will be given based on these guidelines. Currently, the specific details of this initiative are being finalized.
