The so-called "avant-garde novels" that have emerged in recent years can be described as a mixture of clear and muddy waters, with jostling debates. Starting with Ma Yuan's transformation, followed by Sun Ganlu, Ge Fei, Yu Hua, and Su Tong forming a wave of avant-garde literature, without manifestos or theoretical summaries, they silently took the stage in a cold and lonely journey. They seem to have left the critical community behind by a full circle, making today's discussions a kind of "catch-up" behavior in the literary landscape.

I believe we should naturally see the changes and developments their works bring to the current novel landscape. However, on the other hand, the stagnation that contemporary novels have faced in recent years is also concentrated in this "new wave." These are flowers that cannot bear fruit.

In the "avant-garde novels" of 1987 and 1988, if one seeks historical consciousness, repentance consciousness, cultural consciousness, ethical consciousness, and natural consciousness, one is likely to be disappointed. They present a certain spiritual phenomenon but avoid spiritual values, a contradiction that has determined some specific trends in their creation from the beginning: abstraction, vagueness, illusion, and uncertainty. In their works, there are some new expressions of the situation and fate of human existence, but they mainly reflect the passive, blind, illusory, chaotic, and even absurd aspects of human existence. This is why we see titles like "Worldly Affairs Like Smoke," "Visiting Dreams," "Narratives of Death," "Escaping Fate," and "Let Women Guess Riddles." This is, of course, a reaction and supplement to the rationalist view of human nature. Along with this change, the new avant-garde novels have further expanded the scope of artistic expression. This is not in the sense of past thematic divisions, such as time boundaries, social stratification, and classification of character activities, but in the sense of artistic integration of "human nature." "Sex" and "death" are the two major themes or the essence of their content. Between these two walls that imprison and stimulate people, a series of images of souls struggling in all directions are displayed. The result is often the unexpected presentation of a batch of psychological specimens that are distant and chaotic, if not perverse, corresponding to life. However, since the avant-garde novels' expression of "human nature" has completely detached from social and historical constraints, these are also flowers that cannot bear fruit.

From the perspective of narrative language, we can see another layer of change in their significance to the development of novels. Since this batch of avant-garde novels also emerged with the call for "cultural experimentation" and "narrative revolution," they have also, in their own way, enriched the novel's narrative methods, structural techniques, and linguistic expressions. These "techniques" are actually inseparable from the meaning of the work: the decentralized, fragmented narrative corresponds to the randomness and disorder of life; the indistinguishability of "true" and "false" characters and the indistinguishability of life and illusion correspond to the loss of reality and the aimlessness of goals.

Avant-garde novels are indeed a reversal and negation of our previous novels. They completely abandon the concept of a "savior" that we have passively held onto in the face of history, but they have also paid a heavy price. The obsolescence of certain values in their works has transformed into the nihilism of values; after rejecting the original value system, they have left only a spiritual wilderness. Their artistic "development" is closely linked to their fundamental weaknesses.

The reading experience of specific works is both differentiated and often connected to some of our perceptions. For example, some of Su Tong's novels that express his childhood psychological memories, such as "Leaving on a Roller Coaster" and "The Sad Dance," are generally fresh and readable, with traces to follow. They revisit the past, with time quietly passing without a trace, leaving a hint of loneliness, and inspiring thoughts. However, they always lack a spiritual destination, "joy and sorrow are all illusions." Even in "Hello, Beekeeper," although the intention is to seek, the tone does not leave emptiness. Yu Hua's works, such as "Worldly Affairs Like Smoke," "Narratives of Death," and "Escaping Fate," use radar's words, "death is always lurking over the living." Moreover, death and violence are inexplicable and irrational. Therefore, it does not give people a sense of exploration and discovery, but only the absurdity of existence, leaving emptiness. Reading Ge Fei's works, he builds a maze-like chaotic world for us. The biggest feature of this world is that "we cannot enter." The fundamental way to create this effect is that if we insist on entering this world, we will find that it actually has nothing. This results in complex and confusing narratives like "Brown Bird Flock" and "Green Yellow." Sun Ganlu's series of works mostly provide us with a dream and illusionary artistic world, providing artistic images of spiritual "exiles," "banished," and dreamers. It certainly has some general allegories like the above works, but since it has cut off the "roots" of life, how can a completely illusory life symbolize a real life?

In a sense, "avant-garde novels" are closer to poetry. But except for some fragments, the narrative process supported by scattered thoughts cannot gain continuous fresh sensory stimulation like poetry. On the contrary, due to the weakening of the social or historical content of artistic images, they have caused difficulties in artistic communication and reader interaction. Another impression left by "avant-garde novels" is that they often write their writing process into the novel to blur the boundaries between life and fiction.

By directly infusing the author's (or narrator's) life and feelings into the activities and psychology of characters, the author and characters become indistinguishable. When "avant-garde novels" use the author's thoughts to control the fate of characters at will, the independence, authenticity, and internal logical unity of characters are increasingly weakened. The arbitrary switching of narratives makes the story loose and continuously fragmented, which is fundamentally different from the "stories" and "true fictions" of traditional novels. However, the above narrative handling is not to break the illusion in the sense of distinguishing true from false, but to emphasize the illusory and disordered nature of the world under the pen. It provides an illusory life and an illusory artistic world, a world that is irrational and difficult to grasp, with cultural and ethical judgments being redundant. For this reason, they are somewhat like narrative games.

Narrative games are manifested in the mixing, reversal, ambiguity of language, and the arbitrary configuration, overlapping, and transformation of scenes, breaking the boundaries of certainty in both time and space. The space in the novel is presented as a certain social life surface and its mutual relationships gathered around the narrative thread, while time is transformed into the evolution of life or the movement of history. Although many exploratory novels in the past have weakened social and historical colors to place today and yesterday in one time and place, achieving a more grand generalization, we can still capture the meaning of a certain time and space. The true dissolution of the norms of time and space, and the destruction of the certainty of history and society, while pushing subjective feelings and emotions to the extreme, can only be "illusions." Narrative games based on "illusions," although they also have wit, imagination, humor, and irony in the mixing of language, are ultimately difficult to form a truly heart-stirring force due to their lack of support.

Currently, "avant-garde novels" are the greatest destruction of the existing novel art norms. They have stories but deliberately destroy the meaning or significance contained in the stories. They focus on linguistic changes but ignore the broadest context.

Traditional aesthetic norms make the structural process of novels a process of meaning, but in these novels, due to the arbitrariness of narratives, meaning is continuously fragmented, losing its directional object, ultimately leading to the overall meaninglessness and valuelessness. These novels are flat, with no deep implications, and the ideas are floating while the writing is scattered. The above description, of course, cannot encompass all the works of avant-garde writers. Because Ma Yuan, who represents the turning point of avant-garde novels, still has some unique or interesting works in his narrative stories. Later, such as Yu Hua's "A Kind of Reality," Ge Fei's "Big Year," and Su Tong's "The Poppy Family," some of these works, either in a deeply oppressive atmosphere that makes one's heart tremble, or in a mysterious sense that is difficult to grasp like a riddle, mix human factors into the exploration of history and reality, and in narrative methods and artistic depth, can be said to be a harvest of exploration. However, in terms of the basic direction of most works, I feel that avant-garde novels reflect the above artistic character and spiritual style.

The weakness of the form reflects the weakness of the subject. "Avant-garde novels" have pushed the weak side of the value system of contemporary novels to the extreme in another direction. From the literature of scars and reflection, our creation has always regarded the subject as a product of historical passivity, with a political line determining the fate of a billion people. With the progress of reform, in the face of the tide of social transformation and dramatic changes, various psychological vacuums and spiritual confusion have emerged. Traditional values are weakened or discarded, while new value attitudes and concepts have not yet been established, leading to the emergence of relativism, pessimism, and nihilism. "Root-seeking literature" once appropriately "avoided reality" and turned its gaze to distant traditions and history; while some "avant-garde literature" after "root-seeking" turned its gaze to the expression of disordered feelings and life instincts, expressing a series of irrational existences. However, when we replace "life consciousness" with "life instinct," we cannot achieve the deepening of artistic aesthetics and the elevation of life's realm, because literature always expresses what is added to instinct. True instinct is not worth literary expression and has no aesthetic value. Aesthetic consciousness is formed in the process of human civilization evolution, and its meaning is always deeply expressed as a certain historical accumulation and a requirement for the development of human nature. It is precisely because the avant-garde novels after root-seeking have not been able to gain new and powerful spiritual consciousness support from life that they express the emptiness of values.

　　“先锋小说”的意义
　　吴秉杰
    近些年出现的一批所谓“先锋小说”，可以说是“淄渑并泛，朱紫相夺，喧议竞起”。从马原开始的转换，到孙甘露、格非、余华、苏童等形成的一股先锋潮头，没有“宣言”与各种张扬，没有各种理论的概括，在孤冷而寂寞的途中不知不觉地登上了令人瞩目的前台。他们似乎还把批评界甩开了整整一圈，使今日的讨论也成为蠡测发展中的文学态势的一种“补课”行为。
    我觉得，我们自然应该看到他们的创作在当前小说格局内的某种变化及发展的意义；可另一方面，新时期小说发展到近年所面临的阻滞也集中地在这一“新潮”中体现出来。这是一批不能结出果实的花朵。
    在１９８７、１９８８年的“先锋小说”中，若是想寻找作品中凝结着的历史意识、忏悔意识、文化意识、伦理意识、自然意识等等，那么多半会感到失望。它们提供某种精神的现象，又竭力回避精神的价值，这一矛盾从一开始便决定了他们创作中一些特定的势头：即抽象、模糊、虚幻与不确定的形态。在他们的作品中，对于“人”的生存的处境与命运有一些新的表现，不过它集中反映的是人的被动、盲目、虚幻、混乱乃至荒诞的存在的一面，这便有了“世事如烟”、“访问梦境”、“死亡叙述”、“难逃劫数”、“请女人猜谜”这样一些小说的标题。这当然是对于理性主义人性观的一种反拨与补充。与这一变化相联系，新的先锋小说也使艺术表现的领域进一步有所扩展。这并不是在过去题材划分的意义上而言，不是那种时间分界、社会分层、人物活动分类的表现，而是在艺术贯通的“人性”的意义上来说的。“性”与“死亡”是他们作品的两大主题或者说内容的基质，在这两堵囚禁着又激发着人的高墙之间，同时展开了一幅幅四处奔突的心灵的图像。其结果，常是意外地推出了一批与疏离而又混乱的生活相对应的，朦胧乃至变态的心理标本。然而，由于“先锋小说”这种对“人性”的表现已完全脱离了社会的、历史的限定，这又是一批不能结出果实的花朵。
    从语言叙述的角度，我们还可以看到它们在小说发展中的另一层变化的意义。由于这批先锋小说也是伴随着“文化实验”、“叙述革命”的呼声而兴起的，它们也以自己特有的方式促成了小说在叙事方式、结构手段、语言表述上的更加丰富。而这些“技巧”实际上也是不能与作品意味简单分离的：叙述的无中心、零散化对应着生活的随机性、无秩序；人物的“真假难辨”、生活与幻象不分对应着现实感的丧失及目标的茫然。
    “先锋小说”确实是对我们以往小说的背逆与否定，它彻底地抛弃了我们以往在被动地面对历史时暗中企盼着的“救世主”概念，然而它也付出了沉重的代价。某种价值观的陈旧在他们的作品中转化为价值观的虚无；拒绝原有的价值体系后，便只为自己留下了一片精神的荒原。它的艺术“发展”是与它的根本弱点紧紧结合在一起的。
    具体作品的阅读感受既区分，也往往钩连起我们的一些体会。例如苏童一些表达自己童年心理记忆的小说《乘滑轮车远去》、《伤心的舞蹈》等大致都清新可读，有迹可循。它回溯往事，时间在悄静无痕中流逝，留下一丝淡淡的寂寞，还发人联想。然而它总是没有精神的归宿，“悲喜千般同幻梦”。即便如《你好，养蜂人》虽意在寻觅，基调却不离空虚。余华创作的《世事如烟》、《死亡叙述》、《难逃劫数》等借用雷达的话，是“死神时时窥伺着生者”。不仅如此，死亡与暴戾不可追索，毫无理性可言。因此，它并不使人产生曲畅旁通、探奥索隐之趣，除了命运的捉弄，生存的荒诞，剩下的依然还是空虚。读格非的作品，它为我们筑起了一个迷宫般混沌的世界。这一世界最大的特点便在于我们“不得入内”。而制造这一效果的根本方式，又在于我们倘若一定要进入这一世界，那么我们又会发现它实际上一无所有。这形成了像《褐色鸟群》、《青黄》这样复杂、扑朔迷离的叙述的结果。而孙甘露的一系列创作，多数是为我们提供一个梦与幻觉的艺术天地，提供一些精神的“流亡者”、“放逐者”、梦游者的艺术形象。它固然与上述作品一样有着一些最一般的喻意，但既然切断了生活的“根”，完全虚幻的人生又怎么可能象征真实的人生？
    从某种意义上说，“先锋小说”倒更近于诗。但除了某些片段之外，以零散意念支撑起来的叙事过程毕竟不能像诗那样获得不断新鲜的感觉刺激。相反，由于艺术形象的社会性或历史性内容的削弱，它们倒是造成了艺术传达及与读者沟通的困难。“先锋小说”留给人印象颇深的还有，它们经常把自己的写作过程写到小说中去，以造成生活与虚构不分。
    把自己（作者或叙事人）的生活与感受直接渗入人物的活动与心理之中，造成作者与人物不分。当“先锋小说”以作者的意念随时支配笔下人物的命运时，人物的独立性、真实性与内在统一的逻辑性便越来越削弱。叙述的任意转换使故事松散与不断分解，这是它们的“故事”与“真实的虚构”的传统小说故事根本不同的地方。其上述叙述处理却并不是要在辨别真伪的意义上打破幻觉，恰是要突出笔下世界的虚幻性、无序性。它提供虚幻的人生与虚幻的艺术世界，这一世界不可理喻、人生难以把握，文化与伦理判断纯属多余，正因为如此，它们又有些像叙事游戏。
    叙事游戏表现为语言的杂糅、颠倒、暧昧与场景的任意配置、叠合、转换，在时间与空间两个方面尽量打破确定性的界限。小说中的空间表现为围绕叙事线索所集合起来的一定的社会生活面及其相互关系，时间则转化为生活的演变或历史的运动。尽管以往有许多探索小说也淡化社会历史色彩，以求把今朝与往昔置于一时一处，实现更宏大的概括；但我们仍能捕捉到一定时空的涵义。真正消融时间与空间的规范，而把历史、社会的确定性意味尽情破坏，又把主观感觉、情绪推向极限，只能是“幻象”。在“幻象”基础上的叙事游戏，尽管在语言的杂糅中也不乏机智与想象、幽默与反讽，但由于无所倚托，毕竟难以形成真正打动人心的力量。
    当前，“先锋小说”是对于现有小说艺术规范最大的破坏。它们有故事，却有意破坏故事蕴蓄的意义或意思。它们注重语言变化，但又忽略最广大的语境。
    传统美学规范使小说的结构过程成为一个意义化的过程，而在这些小说中由于叙述的随意性，意义不断被分割、零散化，失去指向性对象，终于导致整体上的无意义与无价值。这些小说是平面化的，并没有什么深层的寄托，意浮而文散。这里所述当然不可能囊括先锋作家所有的创作。因为代表先锋小说转折期的马原叙述的故事中，仍有些与众不同或读来有兴味的创作。而随后如余华的《现实一种》、格非的《大年》、苏童的《罂粟之家》等一部分作品，或是在令人心悸的沉郁气氛中，或是在谜一般令人难以捉摸的神秘感中，把人性的因素掺杂于历史及现实的探视之中，在叙述方式与艺术底蕴上也完全可说是一种探索的收获。不过，就多数作品的基本走向来说，我觉得先锋小说却是体现了上述艺术品格与精神风貌。
    文体的弱点反映着主体的弱点。“先锋小说”是在另一个方向上把新时期小说价值观薄弱的一面推向到了极致。从伤痕文学、反思文学开始，我们的创作都是把主体视为历史被动的产物，一条政治路线决定着十亿人的命运。随着改革的进展，在社会转型期与剧变的大潮面前，便出现了各种心理的真空与精神的惶惑。传统价值观削弱或被扬弃，而新的价值态度与观念却尚未建立起来，于是相对主义、悲观主义、虚无主义应时而生。“寻根文学”曾恰当地“绕过现实”把目光转向久远的传统，转向历史；而“寻根后”一部分“先锋文学”则把视线转向表现紊乱的感觉与生命的本能，表现一系列非理性的存在。可是，当我们用“生命本能”取代“生命意识”时却并不能取得艺术审美的深化与提升生命的境界，因为文学所要表现的总是本能之上的附加。真正的本能不值得文学加以表现，也无所谓审美的价值。审美意识是在人类文明进化的过程中形成的，其意义便也总是深刻地表现为某种历史的积淀与人性发展的要求。正是因为寻根后先锋小说未能从生活中获取新的、有力的精神意识的支持，它们才表现为价值的虚无。
