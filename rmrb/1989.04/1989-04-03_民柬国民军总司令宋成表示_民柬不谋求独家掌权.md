The Democratic Kampuchea radio station today broadcasted that on March 29, Son Sen, the Commander-in-Chief of the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea, stated in an interview with reporters from the DK radio station and the National Army radio station that the Democratic Kampuchea side (the Red Khmer) will absolutely not seek sole power after the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops.

Son Sen said, "We have repeatedly declared that we do not seek sole power, nor do we allow any side to use force to harm another. The Vietnamese authorities are spreading the rumor that the 'Red Khmer' seeks sole power, which is an excuse for their continued occupation of Cambodia."

Son Sen said that the resistance forces have established a Supreme Defense Council. Now and in the future, Prince Sihanouk is the supreme commander of the Cambodian national army. He said that during the transitional period, we advocate the formation of a temporary army of four sides. No side's army should exceed 10,000 troops. We are willing to hand over weapons exceeding this strength to the United Nations International Supervisory Commission or the United Nations Peacekeeping Force.

Son Sen said that we have already proposed that the United Nations International Supervisory Commission and the United Nations Peacekeeping Force enter Cambodia. The United Nations International Supervisory Commission can set up 24 monitoring points in Cambodia. If more monitoring points are needed, we will also accept them.

Son Sen said that some people say the "Red Khmer" has hidden troops and weapons in certain places. If this is the case, the Cambodian people or other factions in Cambodia can report to the two international organizations stationed in Cambodia, so that they can send personnel to the scene for inspection.

Son Sen said that the above measures will prevent the "Red Khmer" from regaining sole power and will also prevent the Vietnamese invaders from re-entering Cambodia.

### 民柬国民军总司令宋成表示  民柬不谋求独家掌权

　　民柬国民军总司令宋成表示
    民柬不谋求独家掌权
    新华社北京４月２日电  据民主柬埔寨电台今天广播，民主柬埔寨国民军总司令宋成，３月２９日对民柬电台和国民军电台记者发表谈话时指出，民主柬埔寨一方（红色高棉）绝不会在越南撤军后谋求独家掌权。
    宋成说，我们多次声明过，我们绝不谋求独家掌权，也绝不允许任何一方使用武力侵害另一方。越南当局到处散布“红色高棉”企图独家掌权的论调，是为它继续侵占柬埔寨找借口。
    宋成说，抵抗力量已成立了国防最高委员会。无论现在和将来，西哈努克亲王都是柬埔寨国家军队的最高统帅。他说，在过渡时期，我们主张组成四方临时军队。任何一方的军队不得超过一万人。我们愿意把超过这个兵力的武器交给联合国国际监督委员会或联合国国际维持和平部队。
    宋成说，我们已经建议联合国国际监督委员会和联合国国际维持和平部队进驻柬埔寨。联合国国际监督委员会可以在柬埔寨设２４个点进行监督。如果需要增设监督点，我们也会接受。
    宋成说，有人说“红色高棉”在某些地方隐藏了部队和武器。如果是这样的话，柬埔寨人民或柬埔寨的其他派别可以向进驻柬埔寨的两个国际组织控诉，以便让他们派出工作人员到现场进行监察。
    宋成说，上述措施将阻止“红色高棉”重新单独掌权，也将阻止越南侵略者再次侵入柬埔寨。
