Jianchuan County is a region where the Bai people of Yunnan reside, with a long history and numerous cultural relics and scenic spots.

The ancient trees of Mangxie Ridge in Jianchuan are dense and towering, blocking out the sky and the sun. The steep cliffs stand tall and stretch for several miles. The stone carvings, Buddhist pagodas, ancient temples, and pavilions within the ridge hold significant cultural value. The Shilong Temple on Shilong Ridge in Jianchuan is built on a stone dragon that stretches for hundreds of meters. It is said that the Shilong Temple and the stone dragon were constructed by craftsmen sent by Zhuge Liang during the Three Kingdoms period. The Jianchuan Laojun Mountain, surrounded by the Jinsha River to the left and the Lancang River to the right, features 15 scenic spots including Jiuhua Island, Xuyun Cave, Liuli Pool, and Ninety-Nine Dragon Pond. The Shizhong Mountain in Jianchuan has numerous stone caves carved from the ancient Nanzhao Kingdom to the Dali Kingdom over several hundred years, serving as tangible historical evidence of the friendly exchanges between Nanzhao and various Southeast Asian countries. Among these, the eight great Yama kings, Buddhist esoteric artworks derived from Brahmanic deities, are said to be the only treasures of their kind in the country. In 1961, the State Council listed the Shizhong Mountain stone caves as one of the first batch of national key cultural relics protection units. However, relevant departments have neglected the protection of these cultural relics, resulting in the destruction of historical relics at Mangxie Ridge, Shilong Temple, Laojun Mountain, and other locations. Many famous historical sites on Shizhong Mountain have also been destroyed.

It is suggested that the local government strictly crack down on illegal activities that damage cultural relics and effectively protect Jianchuan's cultural relics.

　　保护剑川文物
    剑川县是云南白族聚居地，历史悠久，文物古迹、风景名胜甚多。
    剑川蟒歇岭古木森森，遮天蔽日，青嶂矗立，连绵数里，岭中的石刻、佛塔、古刹、楼阁，具有很高的文物价值。剑川钟贤岭石龙寺建在长达数百米的石龙上。据说，石龙寺和石龙是三国时孔明派工匠修建的。“金沙江环其左，澜沧江绕其右”的剑川老君山，山上有九华岛、嘘云窟、琉璃池、九十九龙潭等１５个游览点，剑川石钟山上有从古南诏国到大理国数百年间开凿出的许多石窟，是研究南诏与东南亚各国友好交往的实物史料。其中，源于婆罗门神像的佛教密宗艺术品八大冥王像，据说现在是国内唯一的珍品。１９６１年，国务院将石钟山石窟列为第一批全国重点文物保护单位。然而，有关部门忽视对这些文物古迹的保护，致使蟒歇岭、石龙寺、老君山等处的历史文物惨遭破坏，石钟山的名胜古迹也多处被毁。
    建议当地政府严厉打击破坏文物古迹的不法分子，切实保护剑川文物古迹。
