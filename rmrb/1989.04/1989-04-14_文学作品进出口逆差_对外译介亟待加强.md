The trade deficit in Chinese literary works being introduced abroad compared to the large number of foreign literary works entering China is significant. Some writers, translators, and scholars have called for an urgent change in this situation. There is a consensus that in an open modern society, China needs to understand the world, and the world also wants to understand China. Translating and introducing Chinese literary works abroad is an important way for foreigners to understand China. This work, which has not been given enough attention in the past, urgently needs to be strengthened.

Wang Zengqi believes that foreigners know very little about Chinese literature, especially contemporary literature. He said that during his visits abroad, he often heard questions like "Who is Lu Xun?" Other Chinese writers are even less known; bookstores rarely have Chinese works for sale. Many scholars say that Chinese literature has many excellent works that are in no way inferior to foreign literature. The view of self-deprecation is incorrect. Feng Yidi believes that the key is to select appropriate works for translation and introduction abroad. We should not use the old standard of politics first, but rather translate more works that have artistic vitality and can communicate with all of humanity.

High-quality works require high-level translators. Shen Dalu said that there are very few people in China who can translate Chinese literary works into foreign languages. He used his own translations as an example to illustrate that there are few older and middle-aged translators, and basically no young translators. Cultivating a team of translators is an urgent task. Guo Hong'an believes that translators need to have a background in both Chinese and foreign literature, undergo specialized training, and be cared for materially, so that they do not work hard only to find that their royalties are not enough to buy cigarettes. Some translators say that strengthening cooperation with foreign translators is also an important task. We should not have the inferiority complex that Chinese translators are not as good as foreigners.

Dong Lushan discussed some views on specific translation work. He believes that the two major difficulties for foreign readers are their lack of understanding of the Chinese background and language differences. Therefore, editing and processing are needed. Using the method of direct translation for literary works, as was done in the past for translating Marxist classics, will make foreign readers feel confused.

Zhu Hong said that criticism can be a kind of high-level advertisement. Whether a book becomes famous abroad is greatly related to criticism. This point should not be overlooked.

Many experts have proposed efforts to open up distribution channels and establish extensive contacts with foreign bookstores and publishers to pave the way for Chinese literature to "go abroad."

According to the reporter's knowledge, to narrow the "deficit," some departments and units have already begun to take action. Shen Rengan from the News and Publication Administration provided information that the Copyright Law, which protects the rights of authors and translators, has been revised 18 times and is expected to be submitted to the National People's Congress for discussion in the second half of the year. Shao Hua, secretary of the Chinese Writers Association, said that the "Chinese Literary Works Foreign Translation Fund" has been established, specifically for rewarding translators who have made contributions to foreign translation. Liu Yin, head of the Sino-Foreign Cultural Publishing Company, said that his company is actively carrying out work. The company's series "Chinese Writers View the World," edited by Feng Mu, Yuan Ying, and Shao Yanxiang, is being compiled.

　　文学作品进出口逆差
　　对外译介亟待加强
    本报讯　记者袁晞报道：中国文学作品对外译介与外国文学作品大量进入中国相比，有着很大的“逆差”。一些作家、翻译家和学者呼吁要尽快改变这种状况。大家有这样的共识：在开放的现代社会，中国要了解世界，世界也希望了解中国，对外翻译介绍中国文学作品是让外国人认识中国的重要途径之一，过去不够重视的这一工作亟待加强。
    汪曾祺认为，外国人对中国文学，特别是现、当代文学所知甚少，他说在外国访问时，常常听到“鲁迅是谁？”这样的问话；其他中国作家就更鲜为人知；书店里也很少有中国作品出售。许多学者说，中国文学有不少好作品，一点不比外国逊色，妄自菲薄的观点是不对的。冯亦代认为，关键是要选择恰当的作品翻译介绍到国外，不能延用以往政治第一的标准，应多翻译一些有艺术生命力，又能与全人类沟通的作品。
    高质量的作品须有高水平的译者。沈大力说，国内能把中国文学作品译成外文的人才很少。他以自己的译述为例说明，老年、中年的译者不多，青年译者基本没有，培养翻译者队伍是一项紧迫的任务。郭宏安认为，译者需要有中外文学修养，要经过专门训练，还要从物质上给予关心，才不致辛辛苦苦干半天稿费不够买烟钱。有的翻译家说，同国外翻译工作者加强合作也是一项重要工作，不应有中国译者不如外国人的那种自卑感。
    董乐山就具体翻译工作谈了一点看法，他认为，外国读者对中国背景不了解和语言差异是两大困难，因此需要编辑加工，用过去译马列经典那种方法直译文学作品会使外国读者感到茫然。
    朱虹说，评论可以说是一种高级广告，一本书在国外成名与否跟评论有很大关系。这点不能忽视。
    很多专家提出要努力打通发行渠道，与外国书店、书商建立广泛的联系，为中国文学“出国”铺平道路。
    据记者所知，为了缩小“逆差”，一些部门和单位已经开始行动。新闻出版署的沈仁干提供的消息说，保护著译者权益的版权法已１８次易稿，可望在下半年递交全国人大讨论。中国作协书记韶华说，“中国文学作品对外翻译基金”已经建立，专用于奖励对外翻译有贡献的译者。中外文化出版公司负责人柳荫说他的公司正积极开展工作。这家公司请冯牧、袁鹰、邵燕祥主编的“中国作家看世界”丛书正在编撰之中。
