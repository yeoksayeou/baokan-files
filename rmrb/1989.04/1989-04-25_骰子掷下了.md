Title: The Dice Has Been Cast

The few remaining foreign historical classics in my home are outdated. One is Gibbon's "The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire," and the other is Mommsen's "History of Rome." Additionally, there is a copy of Caesar's "Commentarii de Bello Gallico" with Latin text and English annotations, which is also a classic. These books are probably rarely read now. Looking back to exactly 50 years ago, in 1939, I also wanted to specialize in academia and was encouraged by others to focus on European history. I originally planned to start with ancient Greece, but I couldn't find Greek language teaching materials or historical books, so I reluctantly turned to Rome and struggled through Caesar's Latin while reading Gibbon, managing to finish both books. At that time, it was truly an eye-opener, and I discovered that while Greece had no Rome, the Roman world had Greece. I then sought various means to find Mommsen's masterpiece. Unfortunately, times changed, and I had to switch fields. Others thought I was fickle, but in reality, I was adapting to circumstances, learning whatever I could out of necessity. Although I sold many books during my "re-education" and didn't part with these foreign books, I haven't seen them in decades and barely recognize them as old friends. Remembering Caesar's words, "The die is cast," when he decided to fight to the end, I feel ashamed and unworthy to read his books. However, mentioning this foreign idiom seems to allow for a few more words.

Two thousand years ago, in 49 BC, Pompey and the Roman Senate stripped Caesar of his military command. Caesar decided to fight Pompey, leading his army across the Rubicon River towards Rome. He then pursued Pompey and the opposition to Africa and Asia, ending the "Triumvirate." In 46 BC, he became the "Dictator." In 44 BC, he was assassinated by Brutus and others. When Caesar crossed the river and marched forward, he said, "The die is cast," a phrase that has become a proverb, meaning that the matter is decided and cannot be reversed, with the connotation of breaking the pot and sinking the boat, and having no choice but to proceed.

Mommsen was a strict historian who compiled Roman inscriptions and used artifacts and original materials to verify ancient history. His "History of Rome" is a popularization of historical scholarship into literature. In 1902, a year before his death, he received the second Nobel Prize in Literature. In the last two chapters of this book, he describes with historical facts and passionate prose the various reforms and plans of this dictator who changed the Roman republican system. He discusses politics, economics, law, and extends to religion, education, literature, and art. Finally, he says: The political, moral, religious, and literary collapse of the five-hundred-year Roman Republic was not due to external violence but to internal decay. When Caesar took power, Rome was already old, with its glory still shining but its spirit gone. Even someone like Caesar could not make it rejuvenate. Dawn can only come after the long night has completely passed. Caesar's Rome was in twilight. Only after the long night of history has passed can a new day begin. Various talents will race towards new and higher goals. At this time, some of the seeds sown by Caesar will sprout. Caesar's reign as an emperor lasted only five and a half years, and he fought seven major battles, spending a total of only 15 months in the capital Rome. He designed for posterity, but it could only be completed in the future.

When Mommsen wrote "History of Rome," King William I of Prussia and Chancellor Bismarck had not yet defeated Napoleon III in the 1871 Franco-Prussian War and unified the various states to establish the German Empire. "Caesar" in German is the title of the emperor. Mommsen's enthusiasm for Rome and Caesar showed his longing for the rising Germany. He certainly did not foresee where this empire would eventually go.

Gibbon wrote "The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire" 70 years earlier than Mommsen (1787). Apart from both being historians and writers, they are very different. Rome became an empire in the first century and showed signs of decline from the second century onwards. After its division, the Western Roman Empire fell first, and the Eastern Roman Empire fell later, totaling over a thousand years. What were the main factors leading to its decline? Gibbon narrated historical events and, observing the overall situation, saw that the cultural characteristic of this historical river was Christianity. Therefore, the fall of the empire and the rise of the Christian (Catholic) Church are inseparable. Clearly, Gibbon was examining the Roman Empire from the perspective of the 18th century, after the Reformation, the Renaissance, and the Enlightenment. The book was completed in 1789, two years before the French Revolution. He also did not foresee the events of the next two hundred years.

The Roman Republic lasted about 500 years, the Western Roman Empire also lasted 500 years, and the Eastern Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, extended for another 1000 years. This is a 2000-year history of a world connected by the Mediterranean, linking Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is the soil of modern European civilization. For example, Roman law is a must-read for Europeans studying law. The Twelve Tables of the fifth century BC established private property rights in civil law. By Caesar's time, there were already laws with international private law characteristics. What are the significant differences between this and our legal traditions from the Qin and Han laws to the "Tang Code" and the "Great Qing Code"? Caesar's reign was extremely short, but his influence was long-lasting. Why is this? The Qin, Sui, and Yuan dynasties were all short-lived dynasties, but they were also periods of establishing institutions for future generations. Why is this? History does not answer. The answer to the question of the "past" is the "present." We still lack our own written history of Rome. This may be one of the reasons why we are not very familiar with Europe?

　　骰子掷下了
    金克木
    家里旧有的外国历史名著只剩下两部了。当然都是早已过了时的书。一部是吉本的《罗马帝国衰亡史》，另一部是蒙森的《罗马史》。此外还有一部凯撒的拉丁文附英文注释的《高卢战纪》，也是古典。这些书现在大概很少人读了。回想整整５０年前，１９３９年，我也想在学术上有所专攻，受人怂恿以欧洲史为目标。本来打算从古希腊攻起，但实在找不到希腊文教材和希腊史书，不得已降到罗马，硬啃凯撒的拉丁文兼读吉本，居然将两部书都读完了。当时真可说是大开眼界，而且发现希腊之中无罗马而罗马世界有希腊。随即多方设法找到蒙森的名著。岂知时运不济，情况变化，又不得不改行了。别人以为我见异思迁，其实我是随遇而安，有什么学什么，出于无奈。尽管我在接受“再教育”时当废纸卖了许多书，还没舍得送这几部洋书回炉，但也只是记着几十年不见几乎对面不相识的老朋友而已。想起凯撒当年说“骰子掷下了”时决心战斗到底的豪气未免惭愧，觉得不配读他的书。不过提到这句外国成语似乎还可以多说几句。
    两千年以前，公元前４９年，庞培和罗马元老院解除凯撒军权。凯撒决心对庞培作战，率领大军跨过卢比孔河向罗马城前进。随后追逐庞培及反对者直到非洲和亚洲，结束了“三巨头专政”。公元前４６年，他任“独裁者”。公元前４４年他被布鲁图斯等刺杀。凯撒在渡河进军时说过“骰子掷下了”一句话，传为成语，指事已决定，无可挽回，有破釜沉舟、义无反顾之意。
    蒙森是严格的史学家，曾编罗马铭刻，以文物和原始资料为据考订古史。他写的《罗马史》是将史学成果通俗化的文学著作。１９０２年，他去世前一年，得到了第二届诺贝尔文学奖金。在这部书的最后两章中，他以史实和热烈文笔描述这位改变罗马共和制度的独裁者的各项改革措施和计划。他从政治、经济、法律一直讲到宗教、教育、文学、艺术。最后他说：五百年的罗马共和国的政治、道德、宗教、文学的崩溃不是由于外来的暴力，而是出自内部的衰颓。凯撒掌权时罗马已经衰老，光辉仍在而精神已亡。即使是凯撒这样的人也无法使它返老还童。黎明只有在长夜完全过去以后才能再来。凯撒的罗马已是黄昏。在历史的漫漫长夜过去后才再开始新的白昼。各族人才争向新的更高的目标赛跑。这时凯撒播下的种子中有些才会发出芽来。凯撒成为帝王只有５年半，还连打了７次大战，在首都罗马的时间合计只有１５个月。他为后代做了设计，但只有在未来才能完成。
    蒙森写《罗马史》时普鲁士王威廉第一和首相俾斯麦还没有在１８７１年普法战争中打败拿破仑第三并且统一各邦建立德意志帝国。“凯撒”在德文中就是皇帝的称号。蒙森对罗马和凯撒的热情显出了他对正在兴起的德国的憧憬。他当然料不到这帝国最后会走向何方。
    吉本比蒙森写书（１８５７）早７０年（１７８７）写出《罗马帝国衰亡史》。两人除了同是史学家兼文学家以外，很不一样。罗马在一世纪成为帝国，从二世纪起就隐伏了衰亡的景象。分裂以后，西罗马先亡，东罗马后亡，总共有一千几百年。导致衰亡的主要方面是什么？吉本叙述史事，又总观全局，看出了这段历史长河中的文化特征是基督教。所以帝国的衰亡和基督教（旧教）教会的兴起是不可分的。很明显，吉本是从宗教改革、文艺复兴、启蒙运动后的１８世纪观点考察罗马帝国的。书成于１７８９年法国大革命爆发前两年。他也料不到以后两百年的事。
    罗马共和国约５００年，西罗马帝国也是５００年，东罗马，拜占廷帝国，又延长了１０００年。这是地中海沿岸连接欧、亚、非三洲的一个世界的２０００年历史，是欧洲现代文明的土壤。例如，罗马法是欧洲人学习法律所必读。公元前五世纪的十二铜牌法开民法确立私人财权的先河。凯撒时已有国际私法性质的法律。这和我们的秦律、汉律以及从《唐律疏议》到《大清律例》的法制传统有什么重大差别？凯撒的统治时间极短，而影响极长，这是为什么？秦、隋、元都是短命王朝，也都是开创后代制度的时期。这又是为什么？历史不会回答。回答“过去”问题的是“现在”。我们还缺少自己写的罗马史。这也许是对欧洲不十分了解的原因之一吧？
