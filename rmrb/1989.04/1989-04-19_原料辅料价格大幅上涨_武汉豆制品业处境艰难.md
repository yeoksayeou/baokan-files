Since March, the supply of soy products in the Wuhan market has seen a reduction in quantity, leading to a de facto price increase, which has increasingly drawn the dissatisfaction of consumers.

According to information provided by the *Market News*, currently, Wuhan has seventeen soy product factories. Each month, they produce about three million kilograms of soy products, consuming approximately one million kilograms of soybeans. Due to the significant price increases in the main raw materials and various auxiliary materials for soy products, the soy product factories are facing considerable difficulties. In 1988, the price of soybeans in Wuhan was about 9.8 yuan per kilogram. This year, it has risen to 1.8 yuan, but the selling price of soy products has not changed. In January of this year, the entire soy product industry in the city incurred a loss of over 70,000 yuan, which increased to 150,000 yuan in March.

Under these circumstances, many factories have had to stop producing some soy products that are popular among consumers but have high production costs. At the same time, they have reduced the size of tofu and dried bean curd, making the quantity clearly insufficient.

　　原料辅料价格大幅上涨　武汉豆制品业处境艰难
    本报讯　三月份以来，武汉市场供应的豆制品因份量不足，变相涨价，越来越引起消费者的不满。
    据《市场报》提供的消息，目前，武汉市共有十七家豆制品厂，每月生产豆制品三百多万公斤，要消耗黄豆约一百万公斤左右，由于豆制品的主要原料和各种辅料价格大幅度上涨，豆制品厂步履艰难。一九八八年，武汉市每公斤黄豆价九角多，今年涨到一点八元，但豆制品的售价没变。今年一月全市豆制品行业亏损七万多元，三月份上升到十五万元。
    在此情况下，不少厂家不得不将一些群众爱吃但成本过高的豆制品停止生产，同时，他们还将豆腐和豆干的块头缩小，份量明显不足。
