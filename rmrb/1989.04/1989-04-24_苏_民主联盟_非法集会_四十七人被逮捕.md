Soviet "Democratic Alliance" Holds Illegal Rally
	47 People Arrested

	Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 23rd: The unofficial organization "Democratic Alliance" in the Soviet Union held an anti-government rally in the center of Moscow this afternoon. 47 serious troublemakers were arrested by the police.

	The "Democratic Alliance" was established in Moscow a year ago by several unofficial organizations, claiming to be the "political opponent of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union." It holds a negative attitude towards Leninism, the October Revolution, and the socialist system.

	Several days ago, the "Democratic Alliance" took advantage of the unrest in Georgia to distribute leaflets in Moscow, calling on people to participate in the rally organized by the group on April 23rd. The Moscow City Government warned the organization not to hold the rally, otherwise, it would be dealt with according to law.

	This afternoon at 3 PM, the "Democratic Alliance" held a rally in a park opposite Pushkin Square, shouting nationalist slogans and calling for opposition to the Soviet Union and the current government. Police, internal affairs personnel, and special forces for maintaining social order jointly took action to disperse the protesters.

　　苏“民主联盟”非法集会    
    四十七人被逮捕
    新华社莫斯科４月２３日电  苏联非官方组织“民主联盟”今天下午在莫斯科市中心举行反对当局的集会，４７名严重肇事者被警察逮捕。
    “民主联盟”一年前由几个非官方组织联合成立于莫斯科，自称是“苏联共产党的政治对手”。它对列宁主义、十月革命和社会主义制度持否定态度。
    几天前，“民主联盟”利用格鲁吉亚发生的动乱事件，在莫斯科散发传单，号召人们参加该组织４月２３日举行的集会。莫斯科市政府警告该组织不要举行集会，否则将依法惩处。
    今天下午３时，“民主联盟”在普希金广场对面的一个公园里举行集会，呼喊民族主义、反对苏共和现政权的口号。警察、内务部人员和维护社会秩序的特种部队联合行动，驱散游行示威者。
