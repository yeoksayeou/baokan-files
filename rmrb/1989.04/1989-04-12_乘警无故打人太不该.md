**Police Officer on Train Unjustly Beats Passenger**

On March 1, Zhou Xiaomin from the Coal Science Academy's Mining Research Institute visited our newspaper to report an incident involving a police officer on train 156 beating a passenger. He also provided statements from over 30 passengers in the same carriage.

The visitor stated: On February 23, he took train 156 from Changzhou back to Beijing. On the train, a soldier named Jiang Qijun from a certain unit in Suqian County, Jiangsu, discovered that his wallet had been stolen. He immediately stopped two suspicious young men to question them. At that moment, his wallet and military ID card fell at the feet of one of the young men. He picked up the items and returned to his seat.

A short while later, Jiang Qijun saw three young men with northern accents provoking several migrant workers, even injuring one of them, causing disorder in the carriage. In the chaos, 115 yuan from two migrant workers and 180 yuan from another passenger went missing. Jiang Qijun recognized two of the troublemakers as the same young men he had stopped earlier. He immediately asked his comrade Ding Guofeng to notify the police officer, while he stayed to maintain order. The police officer took the three troublemakers, several migrant workers, and Jiang Qijun to the dining car. Upon arriving at the dining car, the police officer released the three young men. A chubby police officer, without asking any questions, slapped Jiang Qijun twice. Jiang said, "I am a soldier. You called me here to report the situation, why are you beating me without reason?!" The police officer arrogantly replied, "Soldiers can't be beaten?!" Seeing that the police officer was unreasonable, Jiang took his ID card (he had given his ID card to the police officer when reporting the situation) and left. The police officer chased after him, snatched his ID card, and beat him again, then pushed him out of the dining car.

Passengers on train 156 were very angry about the police officer's actions. They said: The duty of a police officer is to maintain order on the train and protect passenger safety, but the police officer on train 156 openly protected the thieves and beat an innocent soldier. They demand that the relevant departments seriously handle this matter.

### 乘警无故打人太不该

　　乘警无故打人太不该
    3月1日，煤炭科学院建井研究所周晓敏到本报上访，反映156次列车乘警殴打旅客的问题，并送来同车厢30多名旅客的证明材料。
    来访者说：2月23日，他由常州乘156次列车回北京。在车上，江苏宿迁县某部解放军战士蒋齐君发现他的钱包被偷，马上拦住面前两个可疑的小伙子查问。这时，他的钱包和军人身份证掉在其中一个小伙子脚下。他拿起失物回到自己的座位上。
    过了一会，蒋齐君看到同车厢3个操北方口音的小伙子向几个民工寻衅，还打伤了一个民工，引起车内秩序混乱。混乱中，两个民工的115元钱和另一位旅客的180元钱不翼而飞。蒋齐君认出其中两个挑起事端的小伙子正是他刚才拦住查问的。他立即让战友丁国锋去通知乘警，自己留在现场维持秩序。乘警把3个寻衅闹事的小伙子、几个民工和蒋齐君一起带到餐车。到餐车后，乘警便把3个小伙子放走了。一位胖乘警一句话没问，上来就打了蒋齐君两个耳光。蒋说：“我是军人，是你们叫我来反映情况的，凭什么无故打人？！”那个乘警竟蛮横地说：“当兵的就不能打了！”蒋齐君见乘警不讲理，拿上身份证（蒋反映情况时，曾把身份证交乘警）就走。乘警追上他，抢走了他的身份证，又打了他一顿，然后把他推出餐车。
    旅客们对156次列车乘警的所做所为非常气愤。他们说：乘警的职责是维持列车秩序，保护旅客安全，而156次列车的乘警却公然袒护小偷，殴打无辜的解放军战士。他们要求有关部门严肃处理这件事。
