Title: Come Back, "Comrade"!

When my gaze fell upon this letter addressed to "Mr. Tianran," and when I saw that it was written by a classmate and close friend, I felt a sense of bewilderment and confusion.

I patiently read on: Recently, a good friend bought a batch of videotapes and playing cards from Guangzhou. On his way back through your county, his goods were seized and he was detained. The detained person is a wealthy businessman. If you can help him, he will surely reward you handsomely afterward.

I began to doubt my own eyes. The incident of smuggling obscene videotapes and playing cards is already known throughout the county. How could this classmate, who had entered and graduated from university with excellent grades, send an urgent registered letter asking for help with such a disgraceful matter? My heart ached, and the scene from last night flashed before my eyes.

Last night, a fire broke out on North Mountain, and the flames, fanned by the wind, rushed towards a forest worth millions of yuan. I saw a few young men playing cards in a house by the road, fully engrossed in the game. I hurriedly informed them of the fire, but a burly man replied in a soft, effeminate voice, "Tell your brothers to go, you pay!" I felt humiliated. When I returned and told my colleagues about this, they also said I was naive: Who would bother with such "trivial" matters nowadays! You go and call for help, you'll just get scolded!

The words in the letter jumped into my eyes again: I heard you are still as bookish as ever, still talking to people about nationality and the state... I tell you, Mr. Tianran, what year is this! Listen to my advice, you are in a good position now, grab what you can, the more the better. You should know that this is the era of the "bosses"!

A surge of indignation welled up in my throat. Money! Money! Money! Warmth and affection, respect and friendship are being swept away by a cold wind of "money worship." The "comrades" around us are diminishing day by day, and we are being pushed into a world where people only recognize the value of money, not the warmth of human hearts! I so badly want to shout out loud: Come back, "comrades"!

　　归来吧，“同志”！
　　天然
    当我的视线移向这封“天然先生收”的来信时，当我看清是同窗挚友写来时，我感到一阵迷茫、困惑。
    我耐着性子看下去：近有一好友从广州购回一批录相带和扑克，路经贵县货被查扣人被拘留。被扣人是腰缠万贯的大老板，如能助其一臂之力，事后必有厚谢。
    我开始怀疑自己的眼睛。这次倒卖淫秽录相带和扑克的事已为全县皆知，何以这位以优异成绩跨进跨出大学之门的老同学，竟会为如此无耻之事发来特急挂号信求情？我心中一阵绞痛，面前又浮现昨晚的一幕。
    昨晚北山发生山火，火借风势直扑价值几百万元的林场。我看到路旁一间屋里有几个小伙子玩牌正在兴头上，便急忙告之火情，谁知，一个胖大个子竟嗲声嗲气地说：“叫哥们去，你掏钱？”我感到受了耻辱。回来一说此事，同事也说我不谙世事：现在谁肯管这“闲事”！你去叫，找骂！
    信里的字又跳入我的眼帘：听说你还跟以前一样书生气十足，还给人家谈什么民族、国家……我说先生，现在都何年何月了！听我一句忠言，你现在占的位置不错，能捞就捞，捞多少算多少，要知道现在是“老板”的天下！
    一股难抑的气愤窜上喉咙，钱！钱！钱！温暖和亲切，相敬和友爱正在被一股“唯钱是举”的寒流席卷而去，我们周围的“同志”正在一天天少下去，我们正在被推向一个只认钞票面额而不问人之寒暖的境地！我多么想大呼一声：归来吧！“同志！”
