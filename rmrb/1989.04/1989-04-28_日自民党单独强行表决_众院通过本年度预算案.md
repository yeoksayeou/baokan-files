Japan's political history in the Diet has seen another unprecedented event. This afternoon, in the Lower House session, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), relying on its majority, unilaterally pushed through the 1989 fiscal year budget. This is the first time the Lower House has unilaterally passed a budget. Opposition parties have strongly opposed this move. Some LDP members also boycotted the Lower House session to express their dissatisfaction with the unilateral vote.

The budget passed by the Lower House will be submitted to the Upper House for deliberation and voting. Regardless of whether it passes in the Upper House, the budget will automatically come into effect 30 days later on May 28.

Before the budget was pushed through, Vice Speaker of the Lower House, Tomoya Nikaido, who is from the Socialist Party, resigned from his post, citing "taking responsibility and expressing protest." Public opinion suggests that, as the situation develops, Speaker of the Lower House, Kenzo Hara, may also face retirement. After the Golden Week holiday in early May, the Diet may still face chaos.

　　日自民党单独强行表决  众院通过本年度预算案
    本报东京４月２８日电  记者于青报道：日本议会政治史上又出现一次“零”的突破。今天下午，在众院会议上，自民党依仗多数议席单独表决，强行通过了１９８９年度预算案。在众院单独表决通过预算案尚无先例。在野党对此表示强烈反对。一些自民党议员也拒绝出席众院会议，以示对单独表决不满。
    众院通过的预算案将提交参院审议和表决。无论在参院通过与否，预算案将在３０天后的５月２８日自然成立。
    强行通过预算案之前，社会党出身的众院副议长多贺谷真稔，以“承担责任和表示抗议”为理由，向众院议长提出辞职。舆论认为，随形势发展，众议院议长原健三郎也将面临引退问题。黄金周连休后的５月上旬，国会还可能出现混乱。
