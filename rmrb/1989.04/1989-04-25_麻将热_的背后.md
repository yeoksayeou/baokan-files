	144 tiles, thousands of possible combinations. Mahjong—this ancient game has captivated countless men, women, young, and old.

	A sample survey in Shanghai revealed that the number of households playing mahjong accounts for more than 15% of the total households in the city. In a certain new village in Beijing, 11 mahjong games are played simultaneously every day in 5 tall buildings. In a small village in Yuxi, Henan, with fewer than 30 households, there are often 7 mahjong tables set up.

	It is undeniable that the force driving so many people to linger at the mahjong table stems primarily from a desire subconsciously controlled by the human psyche. According to psychologists, everyone harbors a subconscious desire to defeat their opponents, and almost everyone has experienced the psychological satisfaction that comes with victory. The competition at the mahjong table and the joy of "winning" precisely meet the subconscious needs and the genuine satisfaction of victory. This constitutes the psychological conditions for people's infatuation with mahjong.

	If playing mahjong is seen as a form of entertainment and relaxation after meals, on holidays, or during leisure time, it can help alleviate fatigue, regulate the mind and body, and exercise intelligence, which is not unreasonable. However, behind the "mahjong fever," the trend of gambling is spreading. Many people have fallen into debt and broken families due to gambling while playing mahjong.

	— Mr. Zhao, a well-known "rich man" from Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Tragically, he did not know what to do with his money. The first time he "played" mahjong, he lost nearly 1,000 yuan in less than an hour. He became enraged and bet another 10,000 yuan, but he still lost. He was devastated.

	— Mr. Wang, an employee of a company. Mr. Wang lost money gambling while playing mahjong and lied to his wife, saying he needed to pay a deposit for a refrigerator, and took 500 yuan from her. He went back to the gambling den to "recover his losses." After a night of "battle," the 500 yuan was gone. The next day, when he returned home, his wife found out the truth and was furious, and they started fighting. Mr. Wang slapped his wife, and she fell to the ground and never got up again. Mr. Wang also ended up behind bars.

	The use of mahjong for gambling is rampant! In the first 10 months of last year, the Public Security Bureau of Yancity, Jiangsu, investigated 15 gambling cases in the urban area, 6 of which involved gambling using mahjong, accounting for 40%. In early this year, the Chaoyangmen Police Station in Beijing's Dongcheng District registered 300 people who used mahjong for gambling among the 50,000 households under its jurisdiction.

	Behind the mahjong fever lies the barrenness of the spiritual and cultural landscape. Historical evidence of social development shows that after people have a certain level of material enjoyment, they naturally seek spiritual enjoyment that matches it. However, our current spiritual and cultural offerings cannot meet people's needs. When the new economic situation and the material civilization that gradually rises with the reforms challenge the lagging spiritual culture, our spiritual culture seems so ill-equipped to cope. Thus, in this spiritually and culturally impoverished domain, mahjong is embraced by those suffering from "spiritual hunger," creating a distorted spiritual and cultural stage.

	Some people are also led astray because they cannot distinguish between legitimate entertainment and gambling. Some start by betting a few cents or dollars, and then the stakes get higher, becoming addicted and unable to extricate themselves, and even spreading the habit, making more and more gamblers.

	Unclear laws and regulations, and weak enforcement, are also significant factors. Some police officials believe that the current penal provisions for combating gambling crimes are too broad and lenient, and gamblers, after being detained or fined, are often "set free like a tiger returning to the mountains." Some active members of neighborhood committees and residents' committees say that when they discover someone using mahjong for gambling, they report it immediately, but the gamblers return to their dens after a few hours, and the reporters are even subjected to retaliation. This creates many obstacles for reporting and handling cases.

	The rise of "mahjong fever" is a social issue that deserves the attention of all sectors of society. For legitimate entertainment, of course, we should not interfere but should guide it correctly; for gambling while playing mahjong, we must take measures to stop it!

### “麻将热”的背后

　　“麻将热”的背后
    何华　张明旺
    １４４块“玉砖”，上千种组合方法。麻将——这一历史悠久的游戏，令无数男女老少爱不释手。
    上海市抽样调查，玩麻将的户数约占全市总户数的１５％以上。北京某新村５栋大楼里每天１１副麻将同时拉开“战幕”。河南豫西某村，一个不足３０户人家的小山寨里常摆有７桌麻将。
    不容否认，驱使着众多的人在牌桌前流连忘返的力量，首先源于人的潜意识所支配的一种欲望。据心理学家分析，任何一个人都潜藏着一种战胜对手的潜意识，同时，几乎人人都感受过战胜对手后油然而生的那种心理上的快感。牌桌上的竞争，“和牌”后的喜悦，恰恰满足了人的这种潜意识的要求和取胜后的真切的快感。这就构成了人们迷恋于麻将的心理条件。
    如果把打麻将作为茶余饭后、假日闲暇时的一种消遣娱乐，可消除疲劳、调节身心、锻炼智力，未尝不可。然而，在“麻将热”的背后，赌博之风随之蔓延开来。不少人因搓麻将赌博而债台高筑，家庭破裂。
    ——赵某，江浙一带有名的“富翁”。可悲的是，他竟不知道钱多了怎么花。第一次“玩”麻将，１０００元不到１个时辰全流进了别人的腰包。他红了眼，又押上１万元，结果还是输了。他悲痛欲绝。
    ——王某，一家公司的职员。王某因搓麻将赌博输了钱，谎称买电冰箱要预付定金，从妻子手里骗得５００元钱，又去赌窝扳“本”。一夜“奋战”，５００元钱又是有去无回。次日回到家中，妻子知道缘由后气恨万分，与他厮打起来。王某猛地一巴掌，打在妻子脸上，妻子应声倒地，再也没有起来。王某也走进了监牢的铁门。
    利用麻将进行赌博何其多！江苏盐城市城区公安局于去年１至１０月份在市区查获的１５起赌博案中，用麻将形式赌博的就有６起，占４０％。北京市东城区朝阳门派出所于今年初对所辖的５００００户居民进行禁赌举报登记，发现有３００多人利用麻将进行赌博。
    麻将热的背后，恰恰掩藏了精神文化园地的贫瘠。社会发展的历史证明，当人们已有一定的物质享受后，就自然会去追求与之相适应的精神享受。可是，我们目前的精神文化还不能满足人们的需求。当新的经济态势和伴随着改革而逐步兴起的物质文明向落伍的精神文化发起挑战时，我们的精神文化却显得那么不堪应付。于是，在精神文化这个不充实的领域里，麻将便被患有“精神饥饿症”的人们双手捧来，筑起一个畸形的精神文化舞台。
    也有一些人是由于划不清正当娱乐与赌博的界限而走上歧途的。有的为了寻求“刺激”，开始押上几分、几角钱，尔后下赌愈大，沉迷于其中不能自拔，而且相互“感染”，赌者越来越多。
    法律、规章制度不明，打击不力，也是一个重要原因。警方一些人士认为，目前打击赌博犯罪的惩治条文过宽过松，赌者被拘留或是被罚款后，往往只能“放虎归山”。一些街道、居委会的积极分子说，我们发现有人利用麻将进行赌博便及时举报，可惜赌徒们没过几个时辰又“回营”了，举报者反而遭到报复。这给报案、办案带来许多阻力。
    “麻将热”的兴起，是一个值得社会各界重视的社会问题。对正当的娱乐，当然不能干涉，而应正确引导；对搓麻将赌博，一定要采取措施予以制止！
