Title: In Search

I came from the night, and dawn is my baptism.
The morning asks me,
What do I miss the most?
It is the fleeting dreams.

There is nowhere to find them.

I walked through the harsh winter, and the snowflakes are my memories.
Spring asks me,
What do I cherish the most?
It is the footprints in the snow.
There is nowhere to find them.

The sea's rhythm is unseen,
Your eyes are unseen.
The sea's rhythm
Only sings of your silhouette.
Perhaps
The sail of thoughts
Has already set sail.
Perhaps
Carrying hope
And a hint of bewilderment,
Gazing at the moon,
The reflection in the waves,
Quietly imagining,
Are your eyes
As hazy as that reflection?

　　寻觅
　　江德文我从黑夜走来晨曦是我的洗礼清晨问我
  什么最留恋是那飘逸的梦境
  无处寻觅我从严冬走过雪花是我的记忆春天问我
  什么最珍惜是那雪地的足迹无处寻觅
　　海韵望不见
  你的眼睛海韵
  只吟唱你的背影也许
  思绪的帆
    已经启航也许
  载着希冀
    还有一丝迷惘眺望着月儿
  波澜中的倩影
    悄悄想象你的眼睛
      是否像那倩影般朦胧
