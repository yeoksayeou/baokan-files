Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 31st. The "Standards Law of the People's Republic of China" will come into effect starting April 1st.

Rushaozeng, Deputy Director of the State Technical Supervision Bureau, made a statement regarding this, pointing out that the Standards Law is an important economic law. Its implementation is of great significance in maintaining the socialist commodity economy order in China and protecting consumer interests. It is also a powerful tool for rectifying the economic environment and improving economic order.

Rushaozeng urged all regions to seriously study and publicize the Standards Law, and promptly formulate and issue relevant regulations. For existing standardization management methods, those that conflict with the Standards Law should be discontinued. Existing standards should be reviewed; some national standards and planned national standards should be changed to industry standards based on their scope of application. Departments should no longer issue departmental standards and export standards. Existing departmental standards should be decomposed and converted; a few may be converted into national standards, while the majority will be converted into industry standards. The approval authority for enterprise standards should be delegated to enterprises. From now on, local standardization management departments and enterprise supervisory departments should stop approving and issuing enterprise standards and local enterprise standards. For technical requirements that need to be unified within the administrative region of a province for the safety and hygiene of industrial and agricultural production, agricultural products, and certain management aspects, local standards can still be formulated.

Rushaozeng said that the Standards Law stipulates that the state encourages the active adoption of international standards. This is an important economic and technological policy of China, which is beneficial for producing more high-quality products to meet the needs of the people and enter the international market.

Rushaozeng particularly emphasized the issue of implementing mandatory standards, pointing out that products that do not meet mandatory standards should be prohibited from production, sale, and export. Especially for standards related to human health, personal and property safety, and the quality performance of some important industrial and agricultural products, such as food hygiene standards, electrical safety standards, and fertilizer and pesticide quality standards, these belong to mandatory standards and should be formulated and supplemented as soon as possible. He said that currently, fake and substandard goods are rampant in the market, seriously harming the interests of the state, collectives, and the broad masses of consumers, and have become a social malady. After the implementation of the Standards Law, relevant departments should strictly enforce the law to crack down on the manufacturers and sellers of fake and substandard goods, and strictly prohibit the production, sale, and import of products that do not meet mandatory standards.

　　维护商品经济秩序　保护消费者利益
    我国标准化法正式实施
    禁止生产销售和出口不符合强制标准的产品
    新华社北京３月３１日电  《中华人民共和国标准化法》从４月１日起开始正式施行。
    国家技术监督局副局长鲁绍曾就此发表谈话，指出标准化法是一部重要的经济法律，它的实施，对维护我国社会主义商品经济秩序和保护消费者利益有着十分重要的意义，也是当前治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序的一个有力武器。
    鲁绍曾要求各地认真学习和宣传标准化法，抓紧制定和发布配套的各项法规。对于现有的各种标准化管理办法，凡是与标准化法相抵触的，都要停止执行；对现有各种标准要进行清理，有一些国家标准和计划制订的国家标准，按其适用范围，要改为行业标准；不应再制定部颁标准和出口标准，现行的部颁标准要进行分解和转化，少数可能转化为国家标准，而大部分将转化为行业标准；切实下放企业标准的审批权，从现在起，地方标准化管理部门和企业主管部门应该停止审批发布企业标准和地方企业标准；对于工农业生产的安全卫生、农产品以及某些管理方面的需要在省级行政领域内统一的技术要求，仍然可以制定地方标准。
    鲁绍曾说，标准化法规定国家鼓励积极采用国际标准，这是我国的一条重要经济技术政策，有利于生产更多的优质产品，满足人民的需要，打入国际市场。
    鲁绍曾特别强调了强制性标准的执行问题，指出不符合强制标准的产品，要禁止生产、销售和出口。尤其是有关人体健康，人身、财产安全，以及某些重要工业、农业产品的质量性能标准，如食品卫生标准、电器安全标准、化肥农药质量标准等属于强制性标准，应该加速制定和补齐。他说，当前伪劣商品充斥市场，严重损害了国家、集体和广大消费者的利益，已成为社会公害。标准化法实施后，有关部门应该依法严厉查处伪劣商品的制造者、销售者，严禁不符合强制性标准的产品的生产、销售和进口。
