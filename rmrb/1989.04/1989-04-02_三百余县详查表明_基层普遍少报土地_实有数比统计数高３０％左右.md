Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 2nd.

A detailed survey of 361 counties has revealed that the actual amount of cultivated land is generally about 30% higher than the reported figures. By the end of February this year, 1,337 counties across the country had undertaken land surveys, covering an area of 840,000 square kilometers. The survey has yielded a large amount of professional maps and textual data, which are the most scientific and reliable land resource data since the founding of the People's Republic.

Through this land survey, the actual situation of land use has been clarified, resolving the long-standing issue of inaccurate land area statistics. It has also clarified land ownership and the utilization status of various types of land, as well as the administrative boundaries at the county, township, and village levels.

The nationwide land survey is expected to be completed by around 1993.
