	Yan Mingfu, Cheng Siyuan, and Fei Xiping Hold a Discussion

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 27 (Reporters Li Zehong, Li Dachuan) — CCP Central Committee Secretary and Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Yan Mingfu, and Vice Chairman of the CPPCC and Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification Cheng Siyuan, held a discussion with the delegation led by Taiwan "Legislative Yuan" member Fei Xiping, known as the "Chinese Democratic Peaceful Unification Visiting Delegation," on the issue of national reunification.

	Yan Mingfu, in his speech, said that the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait have been separated for 40 years, and there are many misunderstandings and even feelings of strangeness between them. I believe that the people on both sides should first increase contact and exchange views sincerely. Only by increasing contact widely can we deepen understanding and increase consensus. He said that exchanges in economics, trade, literature, arts, sports, science, and technology between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are increasing day by day, and these aspects should continue to be expanded in the future.

	Yan Mingfu said that the CCP has proposed the plan for peaceful reunification and "one country, two systems" to unify the motherland. Mr. Fei Xiping and Mr. Hu Qiuyuan and Mr. Xiong Jian from Taiwan have also proposed different plans. As long as we sit down and exchange views, and both sides have good intentions, all problems can be solved.

	Mr. Fei Xiping and Mr. Xiong Jian also introduced their ideas and suggestions regarding the reunification of the motherland during the discussion.

	Wan Shaofen, Yang Zhengmin, Sha Li, Bai Jiefu, and others attended today's discussion.

	After the discussion, Yan Mingfu and Cheng Siyuan hosted a banquet to welcome the visiting delegation.

　　阎明复程思远与费希平座谈
    新华社北京４月２７日电（记者李择红、李大川）中共中央书记处书记、全国政协副主席阎明复及全国政协副主席、中国和平统一促进会会长程思远，今天下午与台湾“立法委员”费希平为团长的“中国民主和平统一访问团”成员就祖国统一问题进行座谈。
    阎明复在会上发言说，海峡两岸同胞已隔绝４０年，彼此间有许多不了解，甚至感到陌生。我认为两岸同胞首先应增加接触，多多坦诚交换意见。只有广泛增加接触，才能加深了解，增加共识。他说，海峡两岸在经济、贸易及文学、艺术、体育、科技等各方面的交流日益增多，今后应继续扩大这些方面的交流。
    阎明复说，中共提出了和平统一、“一国两制”的统一祖国方案，费希平先生及台湾胡秋原先生、熊玠先生等也都提出了不同的方案。只要坐下来交换意见，彼此有诚意，一切问题都好解决。
    费希平先生、熊玠先生也在座谈会上介绍了关于祖国统一的设想及建议。
    万绍芬、杨拯民、沙里、白介夫等出席了今天的座谈会。
    座谈会后，阎明复、程思远设宴招待了访问团一行。
