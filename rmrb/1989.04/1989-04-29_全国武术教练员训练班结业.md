The national wushu coach training class has concluded in Beijing. A total of 30 coaches from various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country participated in the training and study sessions in Beijing.

Since wushu has been included as an official competition event in the Asian Games, domestic and international wushu practitioners urgently need a standardized set of competitive routines to facilitate training and competition. The 20-day training class taught the coaches the routines for the Asian Games wushu competition events, including long fist, southern fist, taiji fist, saber, sword, stick, and spear.
