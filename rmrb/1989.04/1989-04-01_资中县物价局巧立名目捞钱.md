The Price Bureau of Zizhong County Cunningly Creates Excuses to Make Money

Last April, the Price Bureau of Zizhong County in our city collected so-called "production-sales bridge fees" amounting to 10,000 yuan from the Zizhong County Agricultural Materials Company and agreed to include this amount in the company's off-plan fertilizer costs. Subsequently, Vice Director Lai Kunwen of the Price Bureau and staff member Huang, along with personnel from the Agricultural Materials Company, went to Shanxi and Henan provinces to purchase fertilizers. Lai Kunwen and the others did not purchase a single ton of fertilizer but instead had the Agricultural Materials Company pay for their travel expenses and subsidies totaling over 1,300 yuan. Lai and Huang then repeatedly claimed travel subsidies of 101.5 yuan each. In June, Lai Kunwen arbitrarily decided to use canceled fine receipts and deposited the 621.5 yuan in fines into the unit's "small treasury." In August, they discovered that three business units within the county were selling white sugar, refrigerators, and televisions at marked-up prices. They then collected fines totaling 3,800 yuan from these units and listed the amount as "information fees" in the unit's "temporary funds." To evade audit supervision, they also specifically requested that these fined units pay in cash.

The Price Bureau of Zizhong County has violated the law in enforcing the law, disrupting the local economic order. Currently, the Zizhong County Party Committee and the county government have dismissed Lai Kunwen from his position as Vice Director of the Price Bureau.

　　资中县物价局巧立名目捞钱
    去年４月，我市资中县物价局向资中县农业生产资料公司收取所谓“产销搭桥费”１万元，并同意县农资公司将这笔款列入计划外化肥成本。接着，资中县物价局副局长赖坤文和工作人员黄某，随同县农资公司人员一起到山西、河南等地购买化肥。赖坤文等人不仅没有购回一吨化肥，反而让县农资公司支付他们的差旅费和补助款共１３００多元。赖、黄二人又重复报领出差补助费各１０１．５元。去年６月，赖坤文擅自决定启用作废的罚款收据，并将所得６２１．５元罚款纳入单位“小金库”。８月，他们发现县内有３家经营单位有加价出售白糖、电冰箱、电视机等商品的行为，便向这些单位收取罚款３８００元，并以“信息费”的名义列入单位“暂存款”。为了逃避审计监督，他们还特地要求这些被罚单位缴纳现金。
    资中县物价局执法犯法，扰乱了当地的经济秩序。目前，资中县委、县政府已免去赖坤文的县物价局副局长职务。　　　　　　　四川内江市　毛觉云
