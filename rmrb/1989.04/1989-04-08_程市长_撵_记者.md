On March 31, a meeting on agricultural support work by direct units of Changde City, Hunan Province, was about to begin. A television reporter carrying a camera arrived at the venue ahead of time, as per usual.

At this moment, Mayor Cheng Linyi, who was presiding over the meeting, approached and asked, "What are you here for? Are you here to report on the meeting again?"

The reporter blushed.

"I've said it before, we need to reduce meeting reports!" Mayor Cheng continued, "Recently, your meeting reports have been too frequent and chaotic. Leaders are becoming like TV stars, the public doesn't want to watch, and they are cursing. News reporting needs to be reformed, it needs to come out of meetings, report more on events, less on meetings; report more on the masses, less on leaders..." His words left the reporter's face flushed.

"In the future, not all meetings can be reported, the key is to choose wisely, to pick out valuable things from the meetings."

The reporter nodded and left. The camera on his shoulder seemed to have become much lighter.

　　程市长“撵”记者
    ３月３１日，湖南省常德市直属单位支农工作会议即将举行。一名电视记者扛着摄像机，按惯例提前来到会场。
    这时，主持会议的市长程林义走来，见面就问：“你来干什么？又搞会议报道？”
    记者赧然。
    “我早就讲过，要减少会议报道！”程市长接着说：“近来你们会议报道太多、太乱，领导都快成电视明星了，群众不爱看，都骂娘了。新闻报道要改革，要从会议中走出来，多报道事件，少报道会议；多报道群众，少宣传领导……”一席话，说得这位记者一脸通红。
    “今后，会议不是都报不得，问题是要有所选择，要从会议中拣有价值的东西。”
    记者点点头，走了。肩上扛着的摄像机，好像一下子轻了许多。
