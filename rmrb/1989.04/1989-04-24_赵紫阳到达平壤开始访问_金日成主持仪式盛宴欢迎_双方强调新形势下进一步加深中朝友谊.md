General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Zhao Ziyang arrived in Pyongyang by train this afternoon, beginning his six-day official friendly visit. Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea Kim Il-sung hosted a grand welcoming ceremony. Half a million people in Pyongyang took to the streets to welcome him.

At 4 PM, the special train carrying Zhao Ziyang pulled into Pyongyang Station to the tune of a welcoming song and the cheers of the crowd. When Zhao Ziyang, smiling, stepped off the train, Kim Il-sung, who was waiting on the platform, walked up to greet him, shaking hands warmly and embracing each other. Kim Il-sung repeatedly said in Chinese, "Welcome, welcome." The two leaders were delighted to meet again in Pyongyang.

Zhao Ziyang then greeted Kim Jong-il, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and a secretary of the Central Committee, Wu Jin-u, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Minister of the People's Armed Forces, Pak Song-chol, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Vice Chairman of the State, and Yun Hyong-muk, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Premier of the Administrative Council, with warm handshakes and embraces.

When Zhao Ziyang entered the station square, tens of thousands of welcoming crowds cheered and danced. Five thousand colorful balloons soared into the sky, and young women dressed in traditional Chinese and Korean attire danced gracefully. Shouts of "Welcome Zhao Ziyang" echoed through the sky.

Zhao Ziyang and Kim Il-sung together rode in an open-top car to the Paekhwawon State Guesthouse. When the convoy reached the center of the city at Kim Il-sung Square, the welcoming scene reached its climax. Over 40,000 performers danced, creating a sea of joy. Zhao Ziyang and Kim Il-sung stepped down from the open-top car, and young women presented flowers to the two leaders. The chairman of the Pyongyang City People's Committee, Choe Won-sun, presented Zhao Ziyang with a sculpture symbolizing Sino-Korean friendship.

At the Kumsusan Square, over 40,000 lively children from Pyongyang performed the Rabbit Dance, Sunflower Dance, and Red Ribbon Dance. The representative of the Korean Children's Union Central Committee, on behalf of all children in Korea, expressed a warm welcome to Zhao Ziyang. The children tied red scarves around the necks of Zhao Ziyang and Kim Il-sung.

Kim Yong-sun, the head of the International Department of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, specially went to the border city of Sinuiju to welcome Zhao Ziyang and his delegation.
