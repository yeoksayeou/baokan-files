“Happy times always pass by so quickly!” Tonight, at the Kunlun Hotel, during the farewell gathering for athletes from both sides of the Taiwan Strait, the chairman of the Chinese Taipei Gymnastics Association, Zhuang Xiushi, expressed this sentiment, perfectly capturing the feelings of the entire Chinese Taipei gymnastics team as they prepared to leave Beijing and return to Taiwan.

The Chinese Taipei gymnastics team, which made its first official visit to the mainland to participate in an intercontinental competition, successfully completed a nine-day schedule of training, competition, and sightseeing. They will depart for Taiwan by plane tomorrow morning. The Chinese Olympic Committee held a farewell banquet tonight for their Taiwanese compatriots.

The deputy secretary-general of the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee, Zhan Deji, spoke with emotion: “When I first arrived, I described my feelings upon stepping onto the mainland as ‘both unfamiliar and familiar’ in six words. Now, as I prepare to leave, I want to use ‘perfect, familiar, and complete’ in nine words to express my sentiments. I will take this beautiful friendship from the mainland people back to Taiwan and share it with the people of Taiwan.”

The leader of the Chinese Taipei gymnastics team, Zhuang Xiushi, said: “Especially in the last three days of sightseeing, walking on Chinese soil, and seeing Chinese history, a 40-year wish has finally been fulfilled, making me particularly excited. There are so many things I want to say, but I don’t know where to start. This beautiful memory will be unforgettable for the rest of our lives.”

After several days of living and competing together, the athletes from both sides of the strait have formed deep bonds of sisterhood and brotherhood. The athletes gathered together, chatting warmly, exchanging gifts, and taking photos to commemorate the occasion, with laughter and joy filling the air.
