	U.S. Jews Oppose Shamir's Middle East Policy; Mubarak Calls for Middle East Peace Conference Again

	U.S. Secretary of State Baker said today after meeting with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Shamir that Shamir proposed "encouraging" suggestions for solving the Middle East problem, but he did not reveal the specific content of the suggestions.

	Baker said, "Shamir's suggestions are very encouraging. These suggestions will have the hope of becoming the basis for our promotion of the peace process." Baker described his meeting with Shamir as "fruitful, beneficial, and very friendly."

	Shamir's visit to Washington is part of the U.S. consultations with Middle Eastern countries' leaders to achieve Middle East peace. Egyptian President Mubarak has just concluded his visit to Washington.

	Before meeting with Baker, Shamir said in an interview with a newspaper that he would propose holding elections supervised by Israel in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to select Palestinians to negotiate with Israel on the issue of occupied territories.

	Shamir opposed holding an international Middle East peace conference last night in New York when meeting with American Jews, refused to negotiate with the PLO, and refused to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories.

	More than 200 American Jews today published a large advertisement in the New York Times condemning Israeli Prime Minister Shamir for continuing to pursue a policy of occupying the West Bank and Gaza Strip and suppressing the Palestinian people.

	The advertisement said, "Mr. Shamir, do not expect American Jews to support your policy towards the Palestinians." These American Jews include writers, teachers, artists, and community leaders.

	The advertisement said, "Millions of American Jews believe that your current policy is immoral, violates the fine traditions of Judaism, and harms the fundamental interests of Israel and American Jews."

	This advertisement was published at the time when Shamir arrived in Washington today to discuss Middle East peace issues with U.S. President Bush and Secretary of State Baker.

	Egyptian President Mubarak said today here that direct dialogue within the framework of an international peace conference on the Middle East issue is the best way to achieve Middle East peace.

	Mubarak, speaking at a luncheon held by the American Foreign Policy Association, pointed out that the guiding principles for resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict are land for peace, ensuring the security of all Middle Eastern countries including Israel, and restoring the rights of the Palestinian people.

	Mubarak suggested that before establishing a fully sovereign Palestinian state, a transitional government should be established in the occupied territories.

	When talking about some people in Israel trying to exclude the Palestine Liberation Organization from the Middle East peace process, Mubarak pointed out that this is a "serious mistake." He said, the PLO should participate in the peace process.

	Mubarak will end his visit to the United States tonight and return to Egypt.

　　贝克同沙米尔会谈
    美籍犹太人反对沙米尔中东政策  穆巴拉克再次呼吁召开中东和会
    新华社华盛顿４月５日电  美国国务卿贝克今天在同来访的以色列总理沙米尔会谈之后说，沙米尔提出了解决中东问题的“令人鼓舞”的建议，但是他没有透露建议的具体内容。
    贝克说，沙米尔提出的这些建议“非常令人鼓舞”，“这些建议将有希望成为我们推动和平进程的基础。”贝克称他同沙米尔的会谈“富有成效、有益和非常友好”。
    沙米尔对华盛顿的访问是美国同中东国家领导人磋商实现中东和平的一部分。埃及总统穆巴拉克刚刚结束了对华盛顿的访问。
    沙米尔在同贝克会谈前接受报纸采访时说，他将建议在约旦河西岸和加沙地带举行由以色列监督的选举，选出同以色列就被占领土问题举行谈判的巴勒斯坦人。
    沙米尔昨天晚上在纽约会见美籍犹太人时反对召开一个中东和平国际会议，拒绝同巴解组织举行谈判，拒绝从被占领的阿拉伯领土上撤走。
    新华社华盛顿４月５日电　２００多名美籍犹太人今天在《纽约时报》上刊登巨幅广告，谴责以色列总理沙米尔继续奉行占领约旦河西岸和加沙地带以及镇压巴勒斯坦人民的政策。
    这则广告说：“沙米尔先生，别指望美籍的犹太人支持你对巴勒斯坦人的政策。”这些美籍犹太人包括作家、教师、艺术家和社团领袖。
    广告说，“数百万美籍犹太人认为你的现行政策是不道德的，违反了犹太人的优良传统，损害了以色列和美籍犹太人的根本利益”。
    这则广告是正值沙米尔今天到达华盛顿同美国总统布什和国务卿贝克讨论中东和平问题之际刊出的。
    新华社纽约４月５日电　埃及总统穆巴拉克今天在这里说，在中东问题国际和平会议的范围内进行直接的对话是实现中东和平的最好办法。
    穆巴拉克在美国外交政策协会举行的午餐会上发表讲话时指出，解决阿拉伯—以色列冲突的指导原则是以土地换和平，保证包括以色列在内的中东所有国家的安全和恢复巴勒斯坦人的权利。
    穆巴拉克建议在建立一个拥有全部主权的巴勒斯坦国之前应在被占领土上成立一个过渡政权。
    在谈到以色列内部有些人企图把巴勒斯坦解放组织排除在中东和平进程之外时，穆巴拉克指出，这是一种“严重的失误”。他说，巴解组织应该参加和平进程。
    穆巴拉克将于今晚结束访美，返回埃及。（附图片）
