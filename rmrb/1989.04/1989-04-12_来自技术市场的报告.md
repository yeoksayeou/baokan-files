In the early 1980s, with the development of socialist planned commodity economy, the technology market emerged, ending the era when the government solely organized the promotion of scientific and technological achievements in China.

Since 1986, the volume of technology trade has been increasing significantly year by year. Currently, the technology market has become the most important channel for the dissemination of technology in China.

	Technological Contracts See Significant Increase, but Imbalances Exist

According to statistics from the technology markets in 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions on the mainland, there are currently 18,000 technology trading institutions, with 442,000 personnel engaged in technology trading, including 203,000 scientists and engineers.

In 1988, China's technology market concluded 265,000 technology contracts, with a total transaction value of 7.24 billion yuan, representing a 101% and 116% increase over 1987, respectively. The number of provinces with technology contract transaction values exceeding 1 billion yuan has reached 16 (an increase of 6 compared to the previous year). Among them, the Beijing region's technology contract transaction value reached over 2.2 billion yuan, accounting for more than 30% of the national total. Next is Liaoning, with a transaction value of 830 million yuan; Shanghai, 660 million yuan; Jiangsu, 420 million yuan. Provinces such as Shandong, Sichuan, Hunan, Tianjin, Hubei, Henan, Heilongjiang, Guangdong, Shanxi, Jilin, Shaanxi, Hebei, and others also have technology contract transaction values exceeding 1 billion yuan. Zhejiang Province is close to 1 billion yuan. The remaining 12 provinces and autonomous regions, although their technology transaction values are all below 500 million yuan, most regions have seen significant increases compared to the previous year. Notably, Tibet has also begun to see technology trading activities. In terms of regions, the transaction value of technology contracts in the North China region has seen the largest increase, reaching four times that of the previous year.

According to analysis, the reasons for the continued significant increase in China's technology market transaction value are primarily the increased demand for technology by enterprises. Factors such as shortages and price increases in raw materials have forced enterprises to shift from extensive management to intensive management, relying on technological progress to improve product quality, reduce costs, and enhance competitiveness. Secondly, from the central government to local governments at various levels, the awareness of relying on scientific and technological progress to promote economic development has been strengthened. In the past two years, most government departments across the country have formulated a series of policies to promote scientific and technological progress, increasing investment in science and technology. The formation of a national technology market network has also accelerated the dissemination of technology, promoting the development of the technology market.

	Technological Transactions See Improved Levels, Larger Contract Scales

Compared to the previous year, the proportion of more challenging technology development, technology transfer, and international contracts has increased. Although the number of technology service contracts has increased by more than 70% compared to the previous year, their proportion among all types of contracts has decreased compared to the previous year. International contracts have seen a significant increase, with Shanghai alone exporting over 40 million US dollars in technology. The overall trend is that small contracts are being replaced by larger ones, and the implementation of larger contracts has created conditions for forming a certain economic scale.

	Measures Needed to Guide Large and Medium-Sized Enterprises into the Technology Market

In 1988, a total of 179,000 technological achievements were transferred to enterprises through the technology market, accounting for 68% of the total number of contracts concluded in the year. The number of projects and transaction values have both increased severalfold compared to the previous year. The number of projects and the amount of money spent by large and medium-sized enterprises on purchasing technology have both increased more than twofold compared to the previous year. Among them, industrial enterprises have shown a significant increase in demand for technology. However, a responsible comrade from the Technology Market Management Office of the State Science and Technology Commission pointed out that although the number of technology contracts concluded in China's technology market last year appears impressive, relative to the 8.16 million industrial enterprises currently in China, only one technology is purchased from the technology market for every 30 enterprises. This indicates that China's technology market still has enormous potential, and measures should be taken to further guide large and medium-sized enterprises into the technology market.

	More Planned Projects Should Be Promoted into the Technology Market

Before 1985, most of the projects traded on the technology market were small, scattered, and outside the plan. In the past two years, the situation has begun to change. Last year, 31,000 planned projects at various levels entered the technology market, with a transaction value of 2.19 billion yuan, an increase of 148% compared to the previous year, accounting for more than 30% of the total transaction value of the technology market. This indicates that governments at various levels have begun to pay attention to using market mechanisms to promote the implementation of some planned projects. However, a responsible comrade from the Technology Market Management Office of the State Science and Technology Commission said that China should have more planned scientific research project achievements enter the technology market. He said that during the "Sixth Five-Year Plan" period, more than 100,000 scientific and technological personnel from over 5,000 scientific research institutions in China conducted scientific and technological breakthroughs, achieving more than 3,800 major achievements. The "Seventh Five-Year Plan" scientific and technological breakthroughs have also entered the fourth year. In addition, there are a large number of highly practical scientific and technological achievements emerging from the "Spark" and "Torch" programs.

How to use market mechanisms to implement and promote the application of such a large number of advanced scientific and technological achievements is a problem that deserves serious attention.

	Accelerating the Implementation of Patent Technologies Through the Technology Market

Currently, the main way to implement patent technologies domestically is through the technology market. According to statistics from the State Patent Bureau on the implementation of 146 patent technologies in 1988, these patent technologies, after implementation, generated a new output value of 1.7 billion yuan and paid 400 million yuan in taxes.

Undoubtedly, the entry of patent technologies into the technology market has improved the grade of technological products, injecting new vitality into the technology market.

　　来自技术市场的报告
　　本报记者　王友恭
    80年代初，随着社会主义有计划商品经济的发展，应运而生的技术市场结束了我国单纯依靠政府组织推广科技成果的局面。
    从1986年起，技术贸易额逐年以较大的幅度递增，目前技术市场已成为我国技术传播最重要的渠道。
      技术合同成交额有较大幅度
        增加，但不平衡
    据对全国29个大陆省、市、自治区技术市场的统计，目前有技术市场交易机构1.8万个，从事技术交易工作的人员达44.2万人，其中有科学家、工程师20.3万人。
    1988年，我国技术市场共成交技术合同26.5万份，成交额达72.4亿元，分别比1987年增长101％和116％。技术合同成交额超过亿元的已达16个省（比上一年多6个）。其中北京地区技术合同成交额达22亿元以上，占全国总成交额的30％多。其次为辽宁，技术合同成交额达8.3亿元；上海6.6亿元；江苏4.2亿元。山东、四川、湖南、天津、湖北、河南、黑龙江、广东、山西、吉林、陕西、河北等省的技术合同成交额也都在亿元以上。浙江省接近亿元。其它12个省、自治区虽然技术交易额都在5000万元以下，但与上一年相比，多数地区都有较大幅度的增长。特别值得提出的是西藏也开始出现了技术交易活动。以大区来看，华北地区的技术合同交易额增长幅度最大，为上一年的4倍。
    据分析，我国技术市场成交额继续大幅度增长的原因，首先是企业对技术的需求增大。原材料短缺、价格上涨等因素迫使企业从过去的粗放经营转向集约经营，靠技术进步来提高产品质量，降低成本，增强企业的竞争力。其次，从中央到地方各级政府依靠科技进步促进经济发展的意识增强。全国大多数地区的政府部门近两年都制定了一系列促进科技进步的政策，增加了科技投入。全国性技术市场网络的形成也加速了技术扩散，推动了技术市场的发展。
    技术交易的层次有所提高，合同的规模增大
    与上一年相比，难度较大的技术开发、技术转让和涉外合同的份额有所上升。技术服务合同的数量虽然比上一年增加70％多，但在各类合同中所占的比例比上一年有所下降。涉外合同明显上升，仅上海一地的技术出口额就达4000多万美元。整个趋势是小合同正在被较大的合同所取代。而实施较大的合同又为形成一定的经济规模创造了条件。
    要采取措施进一步引导大中企业进入技术市场
    1988年通过技术市场流向企业的技术成果达17.9万项，占全年成交合同数的68％，项目数量和交易额都比上一年成倍增长。大中企业购买技术的项目数和金额都比上一年增加了2倍多。其中工业企业对技术的需求量明显加大。但是，国家科委技术市场管理办公室的负责同志指出，去年我国技术市场上成交的技术合同看起来数字十分可观。但相对于我国现有的816万家各类工业企业来说，每30个企业才从技术市场上买走一项技术。这说明我国的技术市场还有巨大的潜力，应采取措施进一步引导大中企业进入技术市场。
          要推动更多的计划项目进入技术市场
    1985年以前，技术市场上交易的项目大多属于计划外零星项目，近两年情况开始有所变化。去年各级计划项目共有3.1万项进入技术市场，交易额达21.9亿元，比上一年增长了148％，占整个技术市场交易额的30％以上。这表明各级政府已开始重视利用市场机制来推动一些计划项目的实施。然而，国家科委技术市场管理办公室的负责同志说，我国应该有更多的计划科研项目成果进入技术市场。他说，我国在“六五”期间共动用5000多个科研单位中的10万多名科技人员进行科技攻关，共获重大成果3800多项。“七五”科技攻关也已进入第四个年头。此外，还有“星火”计划、“火炬”计划等涌现出来的一大批实用性很强的科技成果。
    这样大批先进的科技成果如何利用市场机制来实施推广应用，是一个很值得重视的问题。
        通过技术市场加速专利技术的实施
    目前，国内的专利技术实施工作主要是通过技术市场进行的。据国家专利局对1988年146项专利技术实施情况的统计，这些专利技术实施以后，共新增产值17亿元，上缴利税4亿多元。
    无疑，专利技术进入技术市场提高了技术商品的档次，为技术市场注入了新的活力。
