The "Rizhi" refrigerator incident, which caused a stir for a year, has finally been investigated, and the source of the trouble has been traced back to Pingzhou Refrigerator Factory in Nanhai County, Guangdong.

This small town-owned factory with a hundred or so employees has weak technical capabilities and rudimentary equipment. Operating in borrowed premises, it assembles refrigerators using purchased parts. The inspection results showed that the pass rate was only 11.6%.

These substandard refrigerators took advantage of the ambiguity of the "Rizhi" trademark and the market's panic buying trend, as well as consumers' admiration for foreign goods, to deceive and cheat. In just a few months, they made a profit of 350 million yuan. The factory also signed processing agreements with some places in Zhejiang and other regions that did not have the conditions to produce refrigerators, allowing the production of 189,000 "Rizhi" refrigerators, earning 35.57 million yuan in trademark usage fees. For a time, the trouble spread, and consumers complained in letters, leading to the incident being known as the "Rizhi" refrigerator incident. The local industrial and commercial bureau's opinion on handling Pingzhou Refrigerator Factory is: revoke the business license; cancel the registered trademark; and calculate the fine based on 1.5% of the trademark usage fee, amounting to 53,355 yuan.

Anyone can calculate this account: 700 to 5, the fine is just a small fraction, making it worthwhile to commit the crime. Moreover, even if the business license for assembling refrigerators is revoked, one can still apply for a business license to assemble other products!

According to the competent authorities, some enterprises irresponsibly allow others to use their trademarks to make huge profits, which is a new trend in illegal activities in the economic field. Thinking about it, the counterfeiting trend has been difficult to stop, substandard products flood the market, and illegal cases are frequent. Is all this related to the "profitability" of illegal activities?

　　违法“合算”
    胡度仁
    闹腾了一年的“日芝”冰箱事件，来龙去脉总算查清，祸水自广东南海县平洲电冰箱厂流出。
    这家百十人的镇办小厂，技术力量薄弱，设备简陋，在借用他人的厂房里，依靠购进散件组装冰箱。抽查结果，合格率仅为百分之十一点六。
    这种劣质冰箱，利用“日芝”商标的含糊之意，趁市场抢购之风和消费者崇拜洋货心理，进行欺蒙坑骗，几个月就牟利三百五十万元。该厂又与浙江等地一些不具备生产冰箱条件的，签订加工协议，共许可生产“日芝”冰箱十八点九万台，从中获商标使用许可费三百五十五点七万元。一时间，祸水四溢，消费者纷纷投书叫苦，以至被称为“日芝”冰箱事件。当地工商局对平洲电冰箱厂的处理意见是：吊销营业执照；撤消注册商标；按商标有偿许可使用费百分之一点五进行计算，罚款五万三千三百五十五元。
    谁都会算这笔帐，七百比五，罚款仅是小小零头，违法“合算”，值得干。再说，吊销了组装冰箱的营业执照，还可以申请领取组装其它产品的营业执照嘛！
    据主管部门反映，有些企业不负责任地滥许他人使用商标，以牟取高额利润的做法，是当前经济领域违法活动的新动向。联想起来，假冒风久禁不止，劣质产品充斥市场，违法案件屡见不鲜，这一切是否与违法“合算”有关呢？
