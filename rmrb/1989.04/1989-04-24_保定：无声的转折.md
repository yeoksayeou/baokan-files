Title: Baoding: The Silent Turn

Baoding is a tranquil city. The bustling elements that fill other cities—construction vehicles and towering cranes, prefabricated concrete and steel frameworks, construction sites and rubble—are rarely seen here. In the past five years, Baoding's state-owned enterprises have not added a single new factory, an unusual exception in today's China, known as the "world's largest construction site."

However, there is something even more unusual: Baoding's state-owned industrial sector has a growth rate slightly below the national average, but its efficiency has increased significantly. Over five years, industrial output has doubled, tax revenue has increased by more than three times, and economic efficiency has risen from the bottom of the nine cities in Hebei Province to the top.

One of the most common misconceptions is that only by increasing material inputs can economic growth be achieved. However, this medium-sized city with a population of 500,000 and 32 industrial sectors is quietly taking a different path.

Machines, if they could speak, would surely cry, laugh, and tell many stories worth pondering. At the Baoding Film Machinery Factory, over 200 machines operate day and night, generating nearly 10 million yuan in annual sales. These same machines, from 1978 to 1986, consumed over 300 million yuan in subsidies, accumulated 11 million yuan in debt, wrote off 11 million yuan in materials, and had zero sales revenue.

Why is this worth pondering? Because it proves that the idea that increased supply requires more resource and capital investment is not entirely correct. The potential of our existing industry is enormous!

Baoding's success is largely due to this realization.

The two most remarkable moves are quite ordinary: first, turning losses into profits, reducing the number of loss-making enterprises from 36 to 1, and decreasing the total loss by 95%; second, reducing material consumption by 30% and energy consumption by 60%. These two moves are essentially one: tapping potential. Simple and unassuming, but they have significantly improved Baoding's industrial quality.

Some say, "Contracting saved Baoding"—all factories are now contracted, and all contract terms have been fulfilled;
Some say, "Technological upgrades renewed Baoding"—state-owned industries have almost entirely invested in technological upgrades, and now 64% of output comes from these upgrades;
Some say, "New products revitalized Baoding"—on average, 130 new products are developed each year, and these new products now account for more than half of the city's industrial output.

These are all important. However, in Baoding, it seems that some intangible factors are even more crucial.

After a series of factory mergers, Baoding Sulfuric Acid Plant was also merged into Baoding Chemical Plant. The sulfuric acid plant had spent over 10 million yuan upgrading its sulfuric acid furnaces but still could not increase production, and acid water and gas leaked everywhere. Now, the chemical plant has invested another 10 million yuan. Two months later, it doubled sulfuric acid production, stopped losing money, and no longer polluted. When it connected a pipeline between the sulfuric acid plant and another hydrochloric acid unit, a new product called "chlorosulfonic acid" was born. This seemingly insignificant pipeline has tremendous power; the connection it forms allows the chemical plant to develop new products, saving 10 million yuan and two years.

The stark contrast between the two investments of 10 million yuan lies in the flow and reorganization of production factors. On the surface, Baoding's industrial fixed asset scale has expanded very slowly, but its existing assets are constantly flowing towards more profitable areas. Over 20 enterprises have been "absorbed," and several hundred million yuan in assets and over 1,000 mu of land have entered high-efficiency, low-consumption enterprises, with the sulfuric acid furnace being just one example.

When Baoding Transformer Factory decided to "absorb" the long-loss-making Heavy Machinery Factory, the two factories along Jiangcheng Road formed two opposing camps. Workers at the Transformer Factory said, "We are carrying their 'burden,' and they are eating our 'profits.'" Workers at the Heavy Machinery Factory shouted, "The enemy is here, we are becoming slaves." A series of ideological work sessions failed to calm the opposition, but the merger was still carried out, and internal reorganization continued. It was not until a year later, when the original Heavy Machinery Factory's workers and equipment created three times the value of the past, thus significantly accelerating the development of transformers, that the disputes finally subsided, and the two camps began to unite.

There are even larger-scale conflicts. One example is Baoding's industrial energy-saving reward system. It stipulates that 20% of the savings from energy-saving measures are retained by the enterprise, with more savings resulting in more retention, all used for enterprise energy-saving infrastructure and rewards for advanced individuals. This system's stimulating effect on enterprises' energy utilization rates is obvious, but it also reduces government revenue because the energy-saving rewards are fully included in enterprise costs, thereby reducing government taxes. Therefore, this system has sparked internal debates in Baoding. The government firmly implemented this system and even expanded the scope of energy-saving rewards from key enterprises to all enterprises, reducing government fiscal revenue by several hundred million yuan over four years but increasing enterprises' energy utilization rates by 1.5 times.

The government wants fiscal revenue, departments want increased income, enterprises want retained profits, workers want bonuses, advanced enterprises want development, and lagging enterprises want to survive... Conflicts are everywhere. The difficulty of reform seems to lie in the distribution and friction of interests contained in these contradictions.

"We are not just dividing a pie that has already been baked," said Han Licheng, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee. "We must focus on how to bake a bigger pie."

In the past five years, the retained profits of industrial enterprises in Baoding have increased by 280%, the most; fiscal revenue has increased by 170%, the second most; and workers' income has increased by 164%, the least. The adjustment of interests has tilted towards enterprises. This has allowed Baoding's industry to continue increasing technological upgrade costs despite the annual reduction in national investment.

Subsidies for loss-making enterprises are withdrawn and returned to advanced enterprises, and factory buildings, equipment, and land flow into advanced enterprises. The power shortage is too large, so the Baoding Municipal Government made a tough decision: out of 32 industries and over 3,000 products, only 7 industries and over 50 products are protected, while several dozen factories' transformers are sealed indefinitely. The adjustment of interests is clearly tilted towards advanced enterprises. This allows high-efficiency, low-consumption enterprises to develop faster, and low-efficiency, high-consumption enterprises to have no foothold.

The adjustment of interests must be fair, but the greatest fairness lies in tilting towards efficiency. Baoding has done this, and the result is that industrial efficiency growth has far exceeded the growth rate. A bigger pie has been baked.

To be honest, Baoding's choice was not voluntary but forced by circumstances.

In 1983, when a new municipal committee and government were formed, Baoding's industry was at its lowest point. In the 126-square-kilometer rectangular area of the city, 127 state-owned factories and 110,000 workers were concentrated, with a density roughly equivalent to the national urban average. However, in the past five years, due to various problems left by the "Ten Years of Turmoil," Baoding's industrial output increased by only 0.2%. Half of the machines in its factories were not fully utilized, and the other half lost 50,000 yuan every day they operated. Among the ten-plus million workers in state-owned factories, nearly half did not create any value with their daily labor and relied on state subsidies to live...

Fairly speaking, the temptation to build new factories is strong. As soon as Baoding residents step out of the city, they are engulfed in the bustling construction sea... If Baoding could use the "run fast, get money first" trick to snag a few projects, it might also be possible to "arrange labor, increase output, retain local profits, and have a better life." However, officials who know the situation well searched high and low and found documents from above: "No new industrial points will be established in Baoding."

"Look outward, and you'll find mountains and rivers exhausted," said Mayor Tian Futing, facing Baoding's map. "We can only look inward, rely on potential to stand firm, and gain an advantage through efficiency."

The benefits are obvious, but the price paid is also high: urban construction progresses slowly, street areas change little, and residents' housing conditions improve very little. Helplessly, the government's finances are tight, and to raise 20 million yuan for repairing the civilian power grid, the municipal government saved for four years... Baoding's tranquility indeed has both sweetness and bitterness.

"Five years of hardship, accumulating strength, and the future may be better," the leaders of Baoding Municipal Party Committee and Government privately hold this belief.

This actually involves a very sensitive issue: the term of the current Baoding Municipal Government is only five years, and the momentum it accumulates will be more evident during the next government's term. For the healthy development of the economy, they are willing to do this. More gratifying is that their choice has been accepted by all levels. Factory directors always use the maximum retained profits for enterprise development, and even the bonuses that should be distributed to workers are not fully distributed. Surprisingly, when the directors publicly announced the amounts that should have been distributed but were not, the workers, who had high demands for increased bonuses, had no objections.

This is perhaps an even more valuable achievement!

　　保定：无声的转折
    本报记者  凌志军
    保定是一个平静的城市。
    充塞在其它城市中喧嚣不已的那些东西——工程运输车与擎天吊车、水泥预制件与钢筋铁架、建设工地与瓦砾碎砖……在这里难能看到。
    最近５年里，保定市国营企业没有增加一个新工厂，这在当今中国这个世所公认的“大工地”中，是个罕有的例外。
    然而还有更加罕有的事：保定市国营工业，增长速度略低于全国平均水平；而效益的增长大大高于速度。５年间工业产值翻一番，利税增长３倍多，经济效益水平从河北省９城市之尾跃居第一。
    最通行的误解之一，就是相信只有加大物的投入才是经济增长的唯一途径。但是，记者眼前这座拥有５０万人口和３２个工业行业的中等城市，正默默地走着另一条路。
    （一）
    机器如果有知，它肯定会哭，会笑，会讲出许多令人回味的故事来。
    保定电影机械厂里，２００多台设备日夜转个不停，每年带来近千万元的销售额。也是这些机器，在１９８６年以前的８年中，吃掉了３００多万元补贴，欠了１１０万元债务，报废１１０多万元物资，产品销售额是个零。
    这件事为什么值得回味？因为它证明，不投入更多的资源和资金便不能扩大供给的思路，不完全对。我们现有工业的潜力是何等巨大！
    保定的成功在很大程度上就发生在这里。
    最精彩的两着棋说起来毫无惊人之处：一为扭亏，３６家亏损企业减少到１家，亏损总额下降了９５％；二为减耗，产品物耗总水平下降３０％，能源消耗下降６０％。两着棋其实只是一着：挖潜。平平淡淡，但却使保定工业素质发生了重要变化。
    有人说，“承包救了保定”——工厂已全部承包，而且承包合同全部兑现；
    有人说，“技术改造更新了保定”——国营工业几乎把全部固定资产投资用于技改，如今６４％的产值来自技改；
    有人说，“新产品振兴了保定”——平均每年开发新产品１３０多种，这些新产品已占全市工业产出的一半以上。
    ……
    这些都是重要的。但是，在保定，似乎还有一些无形的东西更重要。
    在一连串的工厂兼并之后，保定硫酸厂也被并入保定电化厂。硫酸厂曾花掉１００多万元改造炼酸炉，还是不能多产硫酸，而且酸水酸气漏得到处都是。现在，电化厂又在它身上花了１００万元。两个月后，它把硫酸产量增加了两倍，不再亏损，也不再污染。当它与电化厂的另外一套盐酸设备之间连上一根管道之后，一个名叫“氯磺酸”的新产品诞生了。这弯弯曲曲的管道的力量实在不应看轻，它构成的联系使电化厂开发的新产品节约了１０００万元和两年时间。
    前后两个“１００万”，结果如此不同，原因何在？是生产要素的流动和重组。表面上，保定工业固定资产规模的扩大极为缓慢，实际上，它的已有的资产正在不停地流向效益好的地方。２０多家企业被“吃掉”，数千万元资产和１０００多亩土地已经进入高效低耗的企业，那硫酸炉只是其中之一。
    （二）
    当保定变压器厂作出“吃掉”亏损多年的重型电机厂的决定时，江城路两侧这两家工厂中一片哗然，形成针锋相对的两大营垒。变压器厂的职工说，这是“自己背着人家的‘包袱’，人家来吃自己的‘油水’”。电机厂的工人则喊道，“皇军来了，我们成了亡国奴”。一连串思想工作仍未平息对立的情绪，但兼并还是实现了，内部的重组也依然进行着。直到一年之后，原电机厂的工人和设备创造出３倍于过去的价值，因而也使变压器的发展大大加快时，纷争才终于平息，两大营垒趋于同一。
    还有更大范围的冲突。一个例证是保定市实行的工业节能奖制度。它规定企业节能部分的２０％折款留给企业，谁节谁有，多节多留，全部用于企业节能基础改造以及先进个人的奖励。这对于企业提高能源利用率的刺激作用是可想而知的，但它同时也使市财政的收入减少。因为节能奖全部计入企业成本，这就减少了政府的税收。所以，这一制度在保定内部曾引起争论。政府坚定地实行这项制度，甚至还能把节能奖的实行范围从重点企业扩大到所有企业，它在４年间使政府财政收入减少几百万元，却使企业的能源利用率提高了１．５倍。
    政府要财政，部门要增收，企业要留利，职工要奖金，先进的要发展，后进的要吃饭……冲突无处不在。改革的困难似乎在于这种矛盾所包含的利益上的分配和磨擦。
    “我们不只是为了分割一块已经烙出来的大饼”，市委书记韩立成说，“我们必须着眼于如何烙出更大的饼”。
    在最近５年中，保定市工业企业的留利增长２８０％，最多；财政收入增长１７０％，居其次；职工收入增长１６４％，最少。利益的调整向企业倾斜。它使保定工业在国家投资逐年减少的局面中，仍有能力把技术改造的费用逐年增加。
    亏损企业的补贴抽回来返还给先进企业，厂房、设备、土地也流入先进企业。电力缺口太大，保定市政府一咬牙，在３２个行业和３０００多种产品中，只选定７个行业和５０多种产品为保护对象，而将几十个工厂的变压器无限期封闭。利益的调整明显地向先进企业倾斜。它使高效低耗的企业更快地发展，低效高耗的企业更无立足之地。
    利益的调整当然是要公平的，但最大的公平体现在向效益倾斜。保定这样做了，结果是工业效益的增长大大超过速度的增长。烙出了更大的饼。
    （三）
    说实在的，保定的选择并不是自觉自愿的，而是困境逼出来的。
    １９８３年，当新的一届市委和市政府组成的时候，保定工业正处在谷底中。城区１２６平方公里的长方形地带上，集中着１２７家国营工厂和１１万职工，其密度与全国城市的平均水平大致相当。但在已经过去的５年中，保定由于“十年动乱”留下的种种问题，工业产值仅增０．２％。它的工厂里有一半机器没有充分利用，另外一半机器每开动一天就要亏损５万元。在国营工厂里的十多万职工中，差不多有一半职工每天的劳动不创造任何价值，反要靠国家的补贴才能生活……
    平心而论，建新厂的诱惑很强烈。保定人一出城门，就堕入热闹的建设之海……保定若能施展一下“跑步（部）前（钱）进”的窍门，捞到几个项目，也有可能，“劳力安排一块，产值上去一块，地方留利一块，日子好过一块”。可是，有知根知底的干部翻箱倒柜，找出上面发下的文件，那上面白纸黑字：不在保定市布新工业点。
    “眼光向外，山穷水尽”，市长田福庭面对保定的版图说，“我们只有眼光向内，靠潜力站稳脚跟，以效益赢得优势”。
    好处是明显的，但它为此付出的代价也不少：市政建设进展缓慢，街区面貌变化不大，市民住房也很少改善。无奈，政府财政拮据，为了搞到整修民用电网的２００万元，市政府竟积蓄了４年……保定的平静中，确实是有甜也有苦。
    “５年清苦，积蓄力量，以后的日子可能会好些”，保定市委和市政府的领导者们私下里怀着这样一种信念。
    这里面实际上包含一个很敏感的问题，保定市本届政府任期只有５年，它积蓄的后劲，更多的是在下届政府任内表现出来。为了经济健康发展，他们宁可这样。更令人欣慰的是，他们这种选择，已为上上下下所接受。厂长们总是把留利最大限度用于企业的发展，即使应当分给职工的奖金也不肯分光。出人意料的是，当厂长们多年把该分而未分的金额公布于众时，对增加奖金呼声很高的职工并无非议。
    这恐怕是更可贵的政绩！
