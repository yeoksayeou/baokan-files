	80 Newspapers Self-Publish Circulation

	According to a report from our newspaper, at the Fourth National Newspaper Self-Publishing Circulation Experience Exchange Meeting held on April 6, Wang Qianghua, Deputy Director of the State Press and Publication Administration, stated that the State Press and Publication Administration firmly supports local newspapers in self-publishing their circulation. This support is sincere and not just lip service; it is wholehearted and not half-hearted. To boost newspaper circulation, he believes that multiple channels must be utilized. While ensuring the effectiveness of mail distribution, self-publishing circulation must also be improved.

	The meeting reviewed the development of newspaper self-publishing circulation over the past four years. From 1985 to 1986, only 6 newspapers in the country self-published their circulation. In 1987, this number increased to 16, and in 1988, it grew rapidly to 32. According to incomplete statistics, this year, the number of newspapers self-publishing their circulation has reached 80.

	Representatives from 131 newspapers and news organizations attended this meeting held in Tianjin.

　　８０家报纸自办发行
    本报讯  在４月６日召开的第四次全国报纸自办发行经验交流会上，国家新闻出版署副署长王强华说，国家新闻出版署坚决支持各地报社自办发行，这个支持是真诚的，不是言不由衷的；是全心全意的，不是三心二意的。为了把报纸发行搞上去，他认为必须采取多渠道的办法，在做好邮发的同时，要把自办发行做好。
    会议回顾了各地报纸自办发行４年来的发展情况。从１９８５年到１９８６年，全国仅有６家报纸自办发行，１９８７年增加到１６家，１９８８年发展很快，达到３２家。据不完全统计，今年自办发行的报纸已达８０家。
    １３１家报社和新闻单位的代表出席了在天津召开的这次会议。
