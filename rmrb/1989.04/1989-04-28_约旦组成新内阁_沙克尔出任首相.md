Jordan Forms New Cabinet
	Shaker Appointed Prime Minister

	BEIRUT, April 28 (Xinhua) — Jordan has formed a new cabinet with Sharif Zayd bin Shakir as the new prime minister, according to a report by Jordan Radio. King Hussein officially appointed Shakir yesterday evening to head the new government, which will take over the duties of the Rifai cabinet that resigned last Monday following mass protests against the government's new economic measures.

	Before becoming prime minister, Shakir served as the director of the Royal Court and commander of the armed forces. The new Jordanian cabinet consists of 23 ministers. Apart from Foreign Minister Qasim and seven other former cabinet members who retain their positions, the majority of the new ministers are first-time appointees.

	In his decree appointing Shakir, King Hussein tasked the new government with restoring the representative system abolished after the 1967 war, eradicating nepotism and corruption, combating political and economic crimes, and reforming the management of state institutions. The king also called for decentralizing governance and strengthening control over the provinces.

	Earlier, King Hussein issued a message to the people, emphasizing that despite recent large-scale protests that resulted in 75 casualties, the government's economic austerity measures, price hikes, spending cuts, import controls, and export promotion policies will continue. These measures aim to overcome the economic crisis, reduce the trade deficit, and enhance the purchasing power of the dinar.

　　约旦组成新内阁    
    沙克尔出任首相
    本报大马士革４月２８日电  记者吴文斌报道：据约旦电台报道，侯赛因国王昨晚正式任命谢里夫·扎伊德·本·沙克尔为新首相，并组成新政府，以接替上星期一因爆发抗议政府新经济措施的群众游行示威而辞职的里法伊内阁的工作。
    约旦新首相沙克尔出任首相前曾担任国王办公厅主任和武装部队司令等职务。约旦新内阁共有２３名阁员，除外长卡西姆等８名原内阁大臣继续留任外，其余绝大多数都是首次入阁。
    侯赛因国王在给沙克尔的组阁诏书中，要求新政府着手恢复１９６７年战争后废除的代表生活制度；治理根除裙带关系和腐败现象、政治和经济犯罪。侯赛因国王还要求新政府整顿国家机关的管理体制。加强对各省的分散化治理政策。
    此前，侯赛因国王在一份告人民书中强调，尽管不久前发生了大规模的游行示威并造成了７５人伤亡，约旦政府采取的经济紧缩，提高物价措施和压缩开支、控制进口、增加出口的政策将继续下去，以便渡过经济危机，减少贸易赤字，提高第纳尔的购买力。
