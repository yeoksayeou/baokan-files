Since the beginning of the 20th century, when Lin Chenzhao and Huang Ren (Mu'an) compiled the "History of Chinese Literature," Chinese scholars have produced around 500 literary history works, including comprehensive histories, period histories, and genre-specific histories. However, only about 30 of these works are truly enduring and influential. This raises a significant question: What distinguishes enduring works from those that are not? What are the common scholarly qualities of the few enduring works? Especially now, as we seek to incorporate updated literary concepts into the construction of a scholarly system, to avoid superficial and shallow academic trends, the construction of a literary history theoretical system must be included in our agenda.

All valuable literary histories can be seen as the history of the modern individual's consciousness.

It is important to recognize that literary theory, literary criticism, and literary history are three interpenetrating yet distinct disciplines within literary studies, each with its own objects, functions, and characteristics. Naturally, literary historians should have a sense of individuality. As modern individuals, they stand on the same temporal observation platform as literary theorists and critics. They should, with an open mind and passionate enthusiasm, absorb, select, and transform the creative and scientifically grounded achievements from contemporary literary trends, turning them into intellectual advantages that can surpass previous scholars and reveal what has not been revealed before. In this sense, all valuable literary histories can be seen as the history of the modern individual's consciousness. Adapting to the updating of literary concepts in the new era, some new literary history works have gradually freed themselves from being mere appendages to social and political history, moving towards a diversified and internalized mode of textual criticism. This allows for a deeper exploration of the rich cultural and aesthetic content hidden within the text. At the same time, there are still some literary history works that oversimplify literary archetypes into political symbols or use a closed realist model to evaluate the diverse world of art. This is an inevitable phenomenon during periods of conceptual change and should not be overly criticized. However, truly groundbreaking literary histories always tend to break away from simplistic and closed literary evaluation systems.

Literary history is a relatively stable system, and thus it should maintain a clear attitude and the right to choose from contemporary literary trends. It should absorb the substantial and innovative achievements from contemporary literary theory, rather than superficial fashionable terms or transient fallacies.

Historians should have a macroscopic historical perspective on contemporary trends. When absorbing new ideas, they should, with a broad mind, integrate effective scholarly methods from the past, including the evidential research methods of the Qing dynasty. Because there are substantial commonalities in scholarly pursuits across different times and places. Liang Qichao's "Outline of Qing Dynasty Scholarship" is a work of intellectual history that could only be written in 1920, not during the late Qing dynasty. This is because he had, by then, adopted a clear scholarly attitude towards the trends around him, transcending the narrow perspective of the practical literature faction he once followed, making the work a true history. Whether one can, through clear choices, transcend oneself is a crucial factor in the success or failure of a literary history work. Hu Shi's "History of Vernacular Literature" was deeply immersed in the vernacular wave of his time, using the adoption of vernacular language as the fundamental criterion for judging whether historical literary works were "dead literature" or "living literature," resulting in a serious imbalance in the book's value system. Lu Xun's "Brief History of Chinese Fiction," on the other hand, did not write an introduction or preface to promote his avant-garde literary consciousness. Instead, he chose the then-novel but historically accepted theory of literary evolution, resulting in more substantial and enduring achievements compared to Hu Shi.

The new concepts of literary history are embodied in its structure and all-encompassing perspective, not merely appended as a "preface" or similar text.

Only those who are not good at theoretical generalization would discuss Sima Qian's literary concepts based solely on his "Autobiography of the Grand Historian" without considering the entire "Records of the Grand Historian." In terms of literary history structure, each scholar can make unique and creative choices, forming a vibrant and competitive landscape of diverse coexistence. However, from the perspective of enduring works by previous scholars, their structures in spirit are all integrations of Chinese and Western elements. From the 19th to the 20th century, Western literary studies shifted from focusing on the operation of literature in broad social domains to emphasizing the structure and linguistic changes of the works themselves. China, as an ancient country with a rich history of historiography, has developed various historical writing styles, including annals, biographies, thematic histories, regional histories, and case histories. Both the West and China have their strengths in macro and micro perspectives, historical materials, and rules, which can be integrated and complemented. The key lies in finding the spiritual bridge that connects various perspectives. This bridge is crucial because literary history is not just about analyzing the internal characteristics of a work but also about describing the interconnections and variations of these characteristics. It further sorts out the basic threads of literary concepts, schools, genres, and the influence of Chinese and foreign literature on specific authors and works. Otherwise, it would not be a history but merely a collection of literary fragments. When Zheng Zhenduo's "Outline of Literature" considered that the Han fu, which was highly praised by orthodox literati, were mostly ornate and empty words, rehashing old ideas, forcing unusual characters, and artificially piecing together passages, and that most of them, except for a few authors like Dongfang Shuo, had lost the author's emotions and the original lyrical intent of Qu Yuan and Song Yu's fu, we find that he sought the bridge between macro and micro perspectives in cultural psychology and aesthetic sentiment.

As one of the most important qualities of a literary historian is "historical insight," the theory of literary history should be rigorous. In terms of cultivating scholarly individuality, personal writings should have a captivating charm.

The thinking patterns of literary historians and literary theorists are not entirely the same. When literary theorists focus on transforming philosophical and scientific trends into literary scientific thinking models through dialectical methods, literary historians will be influenced by these trends. However, they must never forget their fundamental responsibility, which is to discover the most brilliant and charming moments of aesthetic souls in history and to summarize these moments into historical and theoretical forms. Eyes that cannot discover the brilliance of aesthetic wisdom are the most taboo for literary historians. It should be said that our current literary consciousness and the novel materials we possess have both advanced significantly compared to Lu Xun's time. However, we still have not written a comprehensive history of ancient fiction that can compare with Lu Xun's "Brief History of Chinese Fiction." The fundamental reason is not that we lack Lu Xun's brilliant historical insight. Therefore, we still have to use Lu Xun's judgments such as "fiction, like poetry, underwent a change in the Tang dynasty," "it was then that fiction began to be intentionally created," and definitions like satirical fiction and denunciatory fiction. Literary historical insight is a kind of artistic intuition with a historical sense. It recognizes the essence of art through an unobstructed spiritual resonance.

Chinese literary historians, no matter what, should not abandon the tradition of emphasizing scholarly rigor. For those with profound historical insight, rigor is the seed of inspiration. It should be emphasized that rigor is not just a technical issue. Only it can provide a solid foundation for literary historians to absorb new ideas and construct grand systems. Scholarly rigor in the hands of outstanding literary historians is an innovative ability. Lu Xun's pioneering work in the "history of fiction, which has never been written before," was thanks to his diligent research on ancient fiction materials over more than a decade. Therefore, his "Brief History of Chinese Fiction" and Wang Guowei's "Studies on Song and Yuan Drama" were both called "the two jade tablets of Chinese literary history research" by Guo Moruo, "not only pioneering work with no precedent, but also authoritative achievements that have led the way for centuries of later scholars." Many new discoveries in literary history are closely related to the historian's rigor. Zheng Zhenduo's "Illustrated History of Chinese Literature" was the first to include Tang and Five Dynasties transformation texts, Song and Yuan drama and ballads, Yuan and Ming storytellers and quatrains, Ming and Qing short plays and folk songs, as well as precious scrolls, ballad-singing, and drum-singing in literary history, all of which opened up new perspectives in literary history research. Therefore, Zheng Zhenduo said: "Literary history work is not just about compiling, but often about discovering." Literary history works are extremely averse to empty talk. Many profound insights come from the historian's systematic grasp and deep understanding of a large amount of first-hand materials, thus having a clear understanding of the causes and effects of literary development. Whether or not to emphasize rigor is actually a matter of the quality of literary history works. The study of true literary history theory should study how those high-quality literary history works are written, warning people not to repeat the mistakes of another kind that should not be written in that way, and absolutely not to ignore the quality of scholarship and mix them all together in a "stew." This is the rigor of theory. There is one more point worth noting: the literary history works listed above are all personal writings. For a long time, there has been a trend of collective historiography, which has, with collective wisdom, expanded the breadth of Chinese literary history research and left indelible contributions. However, this method of writing requires an outstanding editor who can have a broad vision and command the overall situation. In terms of cultivating scholarly individuality and promoting the substantial progress of literary history research to a deeper level, personal writings have more captivating charm. However, this is also a comprehensive test of the author's theoretical construction, historical insight, and scholarly rigor.

### “重写文学史”，既要呼唤也要实践，但更　应该创立文学史理论体系

　　“重写文学史”，既要呼唤也要实践，但更
　　应该创立文学史理论体系
　　杨义
    自本世纪初林传甲、黄人（慕庵）编著中国文学史以来，中国人写的文学史著作，包括通史、断代史和文体分类史，已有五百部左右，而确有传世的功力和魅力的，大概不足３０部。这就提出了一个值得深思的问题：传世和不传世之作有些什么品位高下之别，而少数传世之作又有些什么共同的学术素质？尤其在当前，当我们要把文学观念更新之所得，逐渐转向学术体系的建设的时候，为了避免空疏浮泛的学风，文学史理论体系的建构就不能不列入议事日程。
　一切有价值的文学史都可以看作具有现代人主体意识的心灵史。
    应该看到，文学理论、文学批评和文学史，是文学科学中相互渗透、而又各有各的对象、功能和品格的三个学科分支。自然，文学史家应该有主体意识，作为一个现代人，他与文学理论家、批评家站在同一座时代瞭望台上。他应该以开放的胸襟，满腔热情地吸收、选择和转化当代文学思潮中那些富有创造性和科学依据的成果，使之成为能够突破前人，发前人所未发的智慧上的优势。在这种意义上说，一切有价值的文学史都可以看作具有现代人主体意识的心灵史。适应新时期文学观念的更新，新出现的一些文学史著作逐渐摆脱作为社会政治史的附庸地位，趋于对作品本文批评模式的多元化和内在化，并由此透视本文的深层面所蕴藏的丰富多采的文化和审美内涵。与此同时，依然存在一些把文学典型简单地政治化，或以现实主义独尊的封闭模式去衡量千姿百态的艺术世界的文学史著作，这是观念变迁时期难以避免的现象，不应苛求。不过，真正有建树的文学史在精神实质上总是倾向于打破简单化的封闭性的文学评价体系的。
  　文学史是一个具有相对稳定性的体系，因而它对当代文学思潮应该保持清醒的态度和选择的权利。它汲收的应该是当代文学理论中具有实质价值的突破性成果，而不是浮面的时髦术语和易于成为过眼云烟的怪论。
    治史之人，对当代思潮的偏正长短也应该有一种宏观的历史感。他在汲收新的观念时，应该以博大的胸襟去兼容历史上遗留下来的行之有效的治学方法，包含清人的考据方法，因为古今中外在做学问上是存在着灵犀相通的实质性的东西的。梁启超的《清代学术概论》是一部学术思想史，只能写成于１９２０年而不能写成于晚清，因为他到这时才对身边思潮采取清醒的学者态度，超越了他曾信奉的经世文学派的狭隘眼光，使一部史书成为真正的史。能否通过清醒的选择以超越自我，是一个关系到文学史著作的优劣成败的问题。胡适的《白话文学史》沉浸于当时的白话浪潮，以是否采用白话作为衡量历史上的文学作品是“死文学”或是“活文学”的根本标准，造成了全书价值系统的严重倾斜。鲁迅的《中国小说史略》并没有像胡适那样写一篇《引子》加上一篇《自序》宣传自己的前卫文学意识，而是选择了当时也属于新颖的而又为历史长期接受的文学进化观，结果他所取得的突破性成果，较之胡适更有本质的意义，也更经得起时间的考验。
　文学史的新观念，是通过它的体制，通过无所不在的眼光体现出来
    　　，而不是写一篇“序言”之类的文字硬贴上去的。
    只有那些不善于进行理论概括的人，才会单凭一篇《太史公自序》而不囊括整部《史记》，去谈论司马迁的史学观念。在文学史的体例上，每个学者都可以做出富有学术个性的选择和创造，形成一种多元并存、互竞其长的生气勃勃的局面。不过从前人那些可以传世的著作来看，其体制在精神实质上都是兼融中西的。西方自十九世纪到二十世纪，文学研究从着重把握文学在广泛的社会领域中的运行规律，到着重阐释作品本体的结构和语言形式的变化。中国作为一个古老的史学大国，长期形成了编年体、记传体、记事本末体、地域史体、学案史体等丰富多采的史学体例。中西之间，从宏观和微观、史料和规律各个层面把握历史，各有其长，可以兼融互补。关键在于寻找到联结各种审视角度的心灵桥梁。桥梁是非常重要的，因为文学史不同于一般的文学批评，它不仅要剖析作品本文的内在特征，而且要描述这些内在特征的相互联系和变异，进而梳理清楚文学观念、流派、文体以及中外古今文学对具体作家作品的影响这些基本线索，否则就会史不成史，只不过是一些文学零件的堆积。当郑振铎的《文学大纲》认为被正统文人推崇的汉赋，大多乃雕饰浮辞，敷陈故实，强搜异字，硬凑成篇，除了少数作家如东方朔等人的作品外，已见不到作者的情感，失去了原先屈原、宋玉辞赋中的抒情诗意的时候，我们发现，他所寻找的宏观与微观间的桥梁是文化心理和审美情致。
　作为文学史家最重要的素质之一是“史识”，文学史理论应具有严
    　　峻性，从发扬学术个性方面讲，个人著述应具动人的神采。
    文学史家和文学理论家的思维方式不尽相同，当文学理论家侧重以思辨的方式把哲学思潮、科学思潮转化为文学科学的思维模式的时候，文学史家会受这些思潮的影响，但他始终不能忘记自身的基本职责，是发现历史上审美灵魂极有亮度、极有魅力的光斑，并且把这种光斑的亮度、魅力概括成史学形态和理论形态。不能发现审美智慧之光斑的眼睛，是文学史家最为忌讳的色盲。应该说，我们现在的文学意识和所掌握的小说史料，均比鲁迅的时代前进了一大步，但我们至今还没有写出一部与鲁迅的《中国小说史略》相媲美的古代小说通史，其根本原因不是别的，而是缺乏鲁迅那种光芒四射的史识。因此，我们还只能沿用鲁迅关于“小说亦如诗，到唐而一变”，“是时则始有意为小说”一类论断，以及讽刺小说、谴责小说一类界定。文学史的识见，是一种带历史感的艺术直觉能力，它通过没有遮蔽的心灵感应，一眼就认出了艺术品之所以为艺术品。
    中国的文学史家，无论如何是不应放弃讲究功力这个传统的。对于卓具史识的人，功力乃是灵感的种子。应该强调，功力不仅仅是一个技术性的问题，惟有它才能给文学史家汲收新观念、建构宏伟的体系提供坚实的基础。学术功力在卓越的文学史家手中，是一种开拓性的本领。鲁迅开拓“自来无史”的小说史领域，是得力于他十余年间对古小说史料钩沉辑佚的功夫的，因此他的《中国小说史略》和王国维的《宋元戏曲考》一道，被郭沫若称为“中国文艺史研究上的双璧”，“不仅是拓荒的工作，前无古人，而且是权威的成就，一直领导着百代的后学”。文学史的许多新发现，是与史家的功力有着密切的联系的。郑振铎的《插图本中国文学史》最先在文学史中列入唐、五代变文，宋、元戏文与诸宫调，元、明讲史与散曲，明、清的短剧与民歌，以及宝卷、弹词、鼓词，都在文学史研究中别开生面。因此郑振铎说：“文学史工作不仅仅是在编述，却常常是在发见。”文学史著作极忌游言无根，许多真知灼见产生于史家对大量的第一手资料的系统把握和深度消化，因而对文学发展的因果了如指掌、有得于心的时候。是否讲究功力，实际上是关系到文学史著作的品位高下的问题。研究真正的文学史理论，应该研究那些品位甚高的文学史是怎样写的，告诫人们不要重蹈另一类不应那样写的故辙，而绝不能不顾学术品位的高下把它们来一个皆大欢喜的“一锅烩”。这就是理论的严峻性。还有一点值得注意，上面列举的文学史著作都是个人著述。长期以来，流行一种集体著史的风气，它曾经以集体的智慧拓展了中国文学史研究的广度，留下了不可磨灭的贡献。但这种著书方法，需要有一个能够高瞻远瞩、驾驭全局的卓越的主编。从发扬学术个性，推动文学史研究向更深的层面取得实质性进展而言，个人的著述具有更为动人的神采。不过，这也是对著述者的理论建构、史学器识和学术功力等多方面才能的系统考验。
