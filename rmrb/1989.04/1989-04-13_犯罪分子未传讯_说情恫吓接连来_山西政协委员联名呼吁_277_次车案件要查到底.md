Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, April 11th - (Reporters Wang Wenliang and Zhang Huaijing) Political Consultative Committee members attending the sixth session of the second meeting of the Shanxi Provincial Political Consultative Committee have issued an appeal, urging relevant departments to thoroughly investigate and seriously handle the case of the train conductor, train staff, and pickpockets colluding to steal and hide passengers' money on the 277th train.

On March 9th, the Beicheng Public Security Bureau of Taiyuan City accepted this case. Before the suspects were even summoned, intermediaries had already come knocking on the door. Some people even tried to bribe their way into the investigation team to gather information, and some even threatened and intimidated the investigators to "leave themselves a way out."

Yesterday afternoon, at the provincial political consultative committee's plenary session, the person in charge of the Beicheng Public Security Bureau was invited by the conference to introduce the case and the progress of the investigation. After that, 116 members of the political consultative committee jointly proposed an initiative, which was supported by all members, urging relevant departments to firmly resist the trend of intercession and resolutely investigate the theft case on the 277th train to the bottom, and to severely punish the criminals and those who intercede according to the law.

　　犯罪分子未传讯　说情恫吓接连来
　　山西政协委员联名呼吁
　　277次车案件要查到底
    据新华社太原4月11日电　（记者王文亮、张怀京）正在出席山西省政协六届二次会议的政协委员发出呼吁，要求有关部门彻底查清并严肃处理277次列车乘警、列车员和扒手沆瀣一气盗窃、隐匿乘客钱财的案件。
    3月9日，太原市北城公安分局受理此案，案犯还尚未传讯，说客就已登门。还有一些人敲开办案组的门打探消息，甚至企图通过金钱买通“关系”，有人甚至威胁恫吓办案人员“为自己留一条后路”。
    昨天下午，在省政协全体会议上，北城公安分局的负责人受大会邀请，向委员和列席代表介绍了案情以及办案的进展情况后，116名政协委员联合向大会提出倡议并获得全体委员支持，要求有关部门一定要顶住说情风，坚决把277次列车上发生的这一盗窃案件查个水落石出，依法严惩犯罪分子和说情者。
