After six years of cooperation and discussion, the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in the United States and the Soviet Academy of Sciences recently issued a joint statement on their vision for new U.S.-Soviet relations. The statement suggests that the guiding principle for U.S.-Soviet relations in the coming decades should be a "sustained peaceful competition" following the end of the Cold War.

According to the statement, the basic principles guiding U.S.-Soviet relations should be: limiting competition that could lead to nuclear war; recognizing each other as sovereign states with equal rights and legitimate governments; maintaining regular communication and consultation; negotiating on issues such as arms control, regional conflicts, and trade and investment; establishing institutions and procedures to ensure the implementation of agreements; and respecting human rights both domestically and internationally.

From the statement, it appears that the goal is to establish rules for U.S.-Soviet bilateral relations in the future, stabilizing the current trend of easing tensions between the two countries. The intention is undoubtedly good. If the U.S. and the Soviet Union follow these principles, it would undoubtedly have a beneficial effect on maintaining the easing of relations between them.

However, the author has some doubts about the practicality of the principles proposed by the "scholars" of the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

Firstly, the statement is based on maintaining the special status of the two superpowers, each bearing a special mission, without considering the possible changes in the world order over the next few decades and the impact these changes might have on the foreign policies of the two countries. This static analysis, based on the current comparison of various forces in the world, has limited practical value for politicians in both countries who are already troubled by many variables at home and abroad.

Secondly, U.S.-Soviet relations are not equivalent to East-West relations. The guiding principles of U.S.-Soviet relations cannot solve all the problems in East-West relations. If other countries are not recognized as sovereign states with legitimate governments, relying solely on the U.S. and the Soviet Union to "promote mutual interests" and "take simultaneous actions" or "reach agreements" to solve problems, isn't this just a replay of the old drama of "U.S.-Soviet domination of the world" that has proven ineffective over the past forty years?

Thirdly, the peaceful competition between the U.S. and the Soviet Union cannot be isolated but must be conducted within the broader context of peaceful competition among all countries in the world. To conduct a fair peaceful competition globally, a prerequisite is that all countries must be on a completely equal footing in international politics and economics. Without such a prerequisite, "peaceful competition" will degenerate into "competition of power." However, achieving this prerequisite is still a long way off. Will the U.S. and the Soviet Union do nothing in this regard, or will they make efforts?

In the author's view, the principles for U.S.-Soviet relations proposed by the "scholars" of the two countries are essentially not far from the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by China, Burma, and India in the 1950s. Instead of spending so much effort on these special principles, it would be better to work with other countries in the world to promote the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as the basic principles for establishing a new international political order. If this could be achieved, the troubled world would benefit greatly.

　　仅仅是良好的愿望
　　塞北
    美国哈佛大学肯尼迪行政学院和苏联社会科学院经过６年合作研讨，不久前就新的美苏关系的设想发表了一项联合声明。声明认为，在美苏结束冷战的情况下，指导今后几十年美苏关系的指导思想应是“持久的和平竞赛”。
    据此，声明认为，指导美苏关系的基本原则应是：限制会带来核战争危险的竞争；承认对方是权利平等的、有合法政府的独立的主权国家；定期沟通情况和协商；就武器控制、地区冲突、贸易投资等问题逐项进行谈判；建立机构和工作程序，使协议得到执行；在国内外尊重人权等等。
    从声明看来，双方的目的在于制订美苏今后在双边关系中的行为规则，稳定当前趋向缓和的美苏关系，其用意无疑是良好的。如果美苏能照此行事，那么对保持它们之间的缓和，无疑将起有益作用。
    但是笔者对美苏两国“秀才”们拟订的这些原则的实效性存在一些疑问。
    首先，声明是从维护两个“都肩负着特殊使命”的超级大国的特殊地位出发的，似乎没有考虑到今后几十年中世界格局可能出现的变化，和这些变化对美苏两国对外政策可能产生的影响。这种把当前世界各种力量对比固态化以后所作的静态分析，对于正被国内外许多变数所困扰的两国政治家来说，实际价值究竟有多大？
    其次，美苏关系并不等于东西关系。用美苏关系的指导原则并不能解决东西关系中的所有问题。如果不承认其他国家也是有合法政府的独立的主权国家，单凭美苏“从促进双方利益”出发“同时采取行动”或“达成协议”来解决问题，岂不是重演过去四十年中已经证明行不通的“美苏主宰世界”的老戏？
    第三，美苏的和平竞赛不可能是孤立的，而只能在全世界所有国家都进行和平竞赛的大格局中进行。而要在全世界进行公正的和平竞赛需要一个前提，即在所有国家在国际政治和国际经济中处于完全平等的地位。没有这样的一种前提，“和平竞赛”就会向“强权竞赛”变形。而现在离实现这一前提却还很远。美苏两国在这方面将无所作为呢，还是作出努力呢？
    美苏两国“秀才”们拟订的美苏关系原则，在笔者看来，实质上似与中国、缅甸、印度在五十年代就倡导的和平共处五项原则相去不远。与其去煞费苦心考虑这些特殊原则，倒不如同世界上其他国家一起努力，把和平共处五项原则作为建立国际政治新秩序的基本原则。果能如此，则扰攘不已的世界就得益匪浅了。
