France's "Liquid Diamonds"

    "Without perfume, spring would be like a garden without flowers." This advertising slogan is often seen in Paris. Parisians call perfume "liquid diamonds," and Paris is thus known as the "City of Perfume." Perfume has become a part of French culture.

    The perfume market is fiercely competitive.

    The perfume industry has created considerable wealth for France. According to reports, in 1987, the perfume industry's revenue reached 31 billion francs, ranking fourth among France's exports. In the Paris market, all kinds of world-famous perfumes can be found, and French perfume exports are seven times higher than imports, with over 50 new products introduced each year. However, France's dominance in the global perfume market has long been broken. The United States is now the world's largest producer and consumer of perfumes. The U.S. market, which accounts for 40% of global sales, introduces an average of more than ten new products each year. A spokesperson for the French company Caran d'Ache candidly admits that the perfume market is "a crazy market." To increase the visibility of their products, companies spare no expense, spending millions to promote their brands. Creative advertisements frequently appear in magazines, on television, and on the streets. Beautifully printed materials are readily available. One company launches "Madame Rochas," another sells "Miss Dior," there are perfumes for people and even for dogs like "Persian." Everyone wants to stand out and make their product a world-famous brand.

    The diversification of perfumes

    Researchers have made significant contributions to the development of the perfume industry. They have developed various new products to cater to people's curiosity and desire for novelty. The perfume industry has also moved towards producing a variety of scents to cater to different tastes. Whether subtle, intense, or even pungent, each type of scent has its own customers. People categorize perfumes into seven types based on scent: single-flower fragrances, bouquet fragrances (a mix of several flower scents), spicy fragrances (a mix of cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and strong floral scents), tree fragrances (wood, moss, sandalwood, etc.), oriental fragrances (musk, etc.), fruity fragrances, and alcoholic fragrances (synthetic chemical blends). There is still a wide range of choices for selecting scents. High-end perfumes are incredibly expensive, such as Byredo at $300, Joy at $230, and Chanel No. 5 at $170 per ounce. Nowadays, perfume is no longer just for women; there are also many men's perfumes on the market. Baby perfumes are also surprising. The BIC company has even introduced a new grade of perfume, targeting those who do not usually use perfume, and has developed a "disposable" perfume priced at 20 francs per bottle to appeal to the general public. The French love dogs, and a perfume called "Persian" priced at around $20 per bottle has also hit the market. Products with various scents to please people are becoming more and more common, including sunglasses, watch straps, handbags, shorts, and even sneakers with strawberry or lemon scents. It is said that scented concrete has also been successfully developed.

    The perfume capital – Grasse

    The city of Grasse in southern France is famous worldwide as the "City of Perfume." Interestingly, it was once a city known for its thriving leather industry, earning it the nickname "Stinky City" due to its foul odors. Later, when the French national treasury was depleted, the government decided to increase taxes on the leather industry, causing it to decline. However, influenced by the upper classes in Italy and other countries who wore scented gloves, local leather merchants turned to producing perfumes. Even the French Revolution did not extinguish people's love for fragrances. The perfume industry has thus endured to this day.

    Parisians believe that perfume is not just a scent; it can express one's personality and elegance, and is also an abstract work of art. Its trends will always be renewed, and thus the development of the perfume industry will be endless.

　　法国的“液体钻石”
    魏玉琴
    “没有香水就等于春天没有花。”这句广告语言在巴黎常能见到。巴黎人把香水称为“液体钻石”，巴黎市也因此而被誉为“香水之都”。香水成了法国文化的一个部分。
    香水市场出奇制胜
    香水业为法国创造的财富十分可观。据报道，１９８７年法国香水业营业额高达３１０亿法郎，居法输出品的第四位。在巴黎市场上，世界各种名牌香水都能买到，而法国香水输出比输入高７倍，一年就有５０多种新产品问世。但法国独霸世界香水市场的局面早已被打破，美国已是世界香水最大的生产者与消费者。占全球销售额４０％的美国市场每年平均推出十多种新产品。法国卡纳尔公司的发言人毫不讳言，香水市场“是一个疯狂的市场”。为了提高自己产品的知名度，各厂家都使出浑身解数，不惜以数百万元巨款促销。别出心裁的广告不时在杂志、电视、街头出现，精美的印刷品随手可得。你推出“罗莎夫人”，我销售“迪奥小姐”，人用的“欢乐”、狗用的“波斯”，谁都想出奇制胜，使自己的产品跻身世界名牌之林。
    香水的多元化
    研究人员为香水业的发展作出的贡献很大。他们针对人们喜奇、试新的心态试制多种新产品。香水业也走上了多元化香味的制造方向，以迎合不同品味的消费者。或淡雅，或浓烈，甚或刺鼻的各种香型都有自己的顾客。人们依据香型把香水大致分为７类，单一花香、花束香（几种花香混合）、辛辣香（肉桂、丁香、生姜与浓花香混合）、花树香（木材、苔藓、檀香等）、东方香（麝香等）、水果香、醇类香（化学混合物制的香味），供人们选择香型的余地还是很大的。高贵的香水每盎司价值惊人，如毕扬３００美元，欢乐２３０美元、卡纳尔五号１７０美元……。如今，香水也早已不是女性的独有之物，已有多种男用香水面市。婴儿香水也令人吃惊，ＢＩＣ公司还推出了新的香水等级，瞄准了本来不用香水的人，开拓出每瓶仅２０法郎的“可丢型香水”去掏一般平民的腰包。法国人爱狗，每瓶约２０美元的“波斯”香水也已出笼，用各种香味取悦于人的产品越来越多，太阳镜架、表带、皮包、短裤，甚至球鞋也有带草莓或柠檬味的。据说，含有香味的混凝土也已研制成功。
　　香水圣地——格拉瑟市
    法国南方的格拉瑟市，以其香水城之名饮誉世界，须知，早年它却是一个制革业十分发达的“皮都”，因臭气冲天的味道，故有“臭都”之称。后来法国国库空虚，决定加重皮革业税收，使皮革业一蹶不振。但由于受到意、西等地上层社会流行戴香手套的影响，此地的皮革商转而生产香水。甚至法国大革命也未使人们爱香的心理泯灭。香水业就此经久不衰，直至今天。
    巴黎人认为香水不仅是一种香味，能使人表达个性，仪态万千，更是一种抽象的艺术品；它的流行趋势会永远翻新，因而香水业的发展也将是无止境的。
