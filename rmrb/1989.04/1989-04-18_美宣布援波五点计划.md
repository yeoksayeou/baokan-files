Xinhua News Agency, Washington, April 17th.

The United States President Bush today announced a five-point aid plan for Poland, expressing "appreciation for the reforms currently underway in Poland and encouragement for further reforms in the future."

Bush traveled to Hamtramck, Michigan, to announce the plan to the Polish-American community.

The five-point plan includes:

	— Bush requested Congress to approve general trade preferences for Poland, selectively reducing tariffs on some imported items.
	— The United States and its Paris Club allies and friends will formulate a new plan to help Poland repay its debts and provide loans to Polish private enterprises through international financial organizations.
	— It is believed that a round-table agreement recently reached between the Polish government and Solidarity will pave the way for Poland to jointly formulate a plan with the International Monetary Fund aimed at supporting market economic policies.
	— The United States encourages commercial and private non-profit organizations to develop various innovative plans to exchange debt relief for equity in Polish enterprises, as well as charitable, humanitarian, and environmental projects.
	— The United States supports imaginative educational, cultural, and training projects to help the Polish people develop their creative abilities.
