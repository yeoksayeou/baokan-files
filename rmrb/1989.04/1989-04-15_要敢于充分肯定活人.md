Title: We Must Dare to Fully Affirm the Living

A foreign historian once summarized China's old traditions as: "valuing the old over the young, valuing the past over the present, valuing established authority over innovation." I would like to add one more: valuing the dead over the living.

It is unclear when this began, but to this day, the old customs persist: as soon as someone dies, they immediately become great and flawless. Words like "wholehearted," "devoted," "spotless," and "fought the most resolute struggle" are freely used. However, when it comes to evaluating our fellow citizens who are still alive, sorry, the words and phrases become much more difficult and stingy. This is not to say that we do not praise and affirm the living, but rather that for the same person, the evaluations given during their lifetime and after their death often differ greatly! Isn't it true? Many individuals who can be considered the backbone of China are only recognized after their death, when people realize that there are indeed outstanding figures in our ranks who are not inferior to the best in the world.

If the "three valuings and three non-valuings" is an answer to why Chinese society has seen little development and change over thousands of years, then the disdain and neglect, criticism, and harshness shown in evaluating the living, stemming from various complex mentalities, is also an important reason for our society's long-term conservatism and lack of vitality.

"The living change." The implication is that only after the coffin is closed can one make a definitive judgment. In reality, how many have been debated for decades, centuries, or even millennia after the coffin is closed? If they truly change, then re-evaluating them is necessary. This is not only normal but also allows other excellent individuals to learn from and draw inspiration from them, thereby aiding in their healthy development.

It is entirely necessary to give the deceased their due recognition. However, it is even more necessary to timely and fully affirm and propagate those who are making effective efforts on various fronts. This can make our society more vibrant, more creative, and progress more quickly. It also helps to make our social mentality more scientific, beautiful, and healthy.

When an outstanding individual dies, some publications publish articles "mourning" them "once" and "twice"; yet during their lifetime, they are often unknown, though not to the extent of Cao Xueqin who "fed his family on gruel and often bought alcohol on credit," but they still commute by bicycle, live in a small room, "four generations under one roof," leading a "double-decker bed" life. This abnormal phenomenon should not continue to appear in our socialist New China.

Not exaggerating the virtues of the deceased and not being overly demanding of the living, evaluating merits and demerits objectively, this is a sign of a society and a nation maturing. Anyone who makes great contributions to the country and society, regardless of their position, age, or whether they are alive or dead, should be timely and fully affirmed and boldly propagated. This is a need for the current economic system reform, and it is also a need for political system reform; it is a need for the construction of socialist material civilization, and even more so for the construction of socialist spiritual civilization.

### 要敢于充分肯定活人

　　要敢于充分肯定活人
　　官伟勋
    有位外国历史学家曾把中国的旧传统概括为：“重老不重幼，重古不重今，重既有权威不重革新。”我还想补充一条：重死不重生。
    从什么时候开始不知道。但至今古风犹存的是：只要人一死，不但立即成了伟大的，而且成了白璧无瑕的。什么“全心全意”啦，“鞠躬尽瘁”啦，“一尘不染”啦，“进行了最坚决的斗争”啦等等，多高级的赞美词都舍得用；但是，一旦要评价我们那些尚在呼吸的同胞时，对不起，用词遣句可就费劲而且吝啬得多了。这倒不是说，我们对活着的人没有表扬与肯定，而是说，对于同一个人，我们在其生前与其死后所给予的评价，往往相差太远了！不是吗？许多堪称中国脊椎骨的人物，直到他们死后人们才发现，原来在我们队伍中也有比起世界各国最优秀的人物毫不逊色的杰出人物。
    如果说“三重三不重”是中国社会几千年没有多大发展变化的一个答案的话，那末，评价活人时，出于各种复杂心态所表现出的轻视与忽视，挑剔与刻薄，也是我们社会长期因循保守缺乏生气的重要原因之一。
    “活人是会变的”。言外之意是，只有盖棺才好论定。其实，盖棺而又争论了几十年、几百年乃至几千年的，还少吗？如果真的变了，需要重新给予评价就重新评价好了。这不仅是正常的，而且还可以使其他优秀人物从中得到启示与借鉴，因而有助于其健康发展。
    对于死去的人给予应有的充分肯定是完全必要的。对于正在各条战线的卓有成效的奋斗者，及时地充分地给予肯定与宣传则更有必要，它可以使我们的社会更有活力，更有创造性，更快地进步，而且还有助于我们社会心态的科学化、美化与健康化。
    一个杰出人物死后，一些报刊发表文章“一哭”“再哭”；而他生痛却长期默默无闻，虽说还不像曹雪芹那样“举家食粥酒常赊”，但也一直自行车来自行车去，身居斗室，“四世同堂”，过着“双层铺居士”的生活，这种不正常的现象，不应该在我们社会主义新中国一而再再而三地出现了。
    对死去的人不溢美，对活着的人不苛求，实事求是地评功过论是非，这是一个社会一个民族走向成熟的标志。凡对国家对社会有大贡献的，不论职位高低，不论年龄大小，更不论生与死，都应及时充分肯定他们，大胆地宣传他们。这是当前经济体制改革的需要，也是政治体制改革的需要；是社会主义物质文明建设的需要，更是社会主义精神文明建设的需要。
