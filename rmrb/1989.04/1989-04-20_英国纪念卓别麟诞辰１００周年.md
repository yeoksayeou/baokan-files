Today, April 16th, marks the 100th anniversary of the birth of the great comedian Charlie Chaplin. London and the film industry have organized various commemorative activities.

From March to the end of August, the Film Museum will host the exhibition "Charlie Chaplin's World," which is the most eye-catching event. This exhibition, consisting of nine parts, recreates Chaplin's life as a touchstone for social and political change: his miserable childhood in the poorhouse; his arduous early years performing in various vaudeville theaters across Britain; his move to Hollywood at the age of 21 and the establishment of his own film company by the age of 29; his cinematic masterpieces; the persecution he faced in the United States during the Cold War and his later life in Switzerland.

The exhibition includes materials related to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which have attracted particular attention. Chaplin lived in the United States for over 40 years but never became an American citizen. The FBI's 1923 personal file on Chaplin, which is on display, might explain this. The file, which is over 1,200 pages long, meticulously records Chaplin's every word and deed, including speculations about whether he had anonymously donated money to the American Communist Party.

From the 1930s to the 1950s, Chaplin wrote, directed, and starred in films that criticized the exploitation of workers by capitalism in "Modern Times," satirized Hitler's fascist regime in "The Great Dictator," and exposed the ugliness of capitalist society in "Monsieur Verdoux" and "Limelight." It was during this period that Chaplin was persecuted by right-wing elements in the United States. Some attacked his private life, while others falsely accused him of supporting communism. In 1952, when Chaplin visited Europe, the U.S. government stated that unless Chaplin submitted to an investigation of his private life and political views, he would not be allowed to return to the United States. Chaplin refused outright and subsequently settled in Switzerland.

In 1972, Chaplin returned to the United States in glory to receive an honorary Oscar for his "inestimable contribution to the film industry in this century." The exhibition features Chaplin's almost universally recognized tramp costume, including his bowler hat, bamboo cane, narrow jacket, baggy pants, and worn-out shoes.

Throughout April, the National Film Theatre in London will screen Chaplin's films. British television stations began airing the series "The Young Charlie Chaplin" in January, introducing Chaplin's early artistic life in Britain.

Additionally, Britain is planning to build a Chaplin Memorial Hall and a Chaplin Film Archive.

### 英国纪念卓别麟诞辰１００周年

　　英国纪念卓别麟诞辰１００周年
    梁丽娟
    今年４月１６日，是当代世界伟大的喜剧演员查理·卓别麟诞生１００周年，英国伦敦及电影界为之组织了多种具有纪念意义的活动。
    从３月到８月底在电影博物馆展出的《查理·卓别麟的世界》展览最令人瞩目。这次展览共９个部分的内容再现了卓别麟作为社会和政治变革的试金石的一生：济贫院的悲惨童年；早年在英国各地杂耍剧场巡回演出的艰辛经历；２１岁移居美国好莱坞到２９岁因事业成功开始创立自己的电影公司；他的电影杰作；冷战时期美国对卓别麟的迫害以及他避居瑞士的晚年生活。
    展览中，有关美国联邦调查局的一些材料引起人们的特别关注。卓别麟在美国生活了４０多年，却没有入美国籍。
    展览会上展出的美国联邦调查局保存的１９２３年卓别麟个人档案也许能说明这问题，仅这一年的记录就有１２００页之多，详细记录了卓别麟的每一个言行活动，包括对卓别麟是否曾匿名捐款给美国共产党的猜测等。
    从３０年代至５０年代，卓别麟自编自导自演了指责资本主义剥削工人的《摩登时代》，讽刺希特勒法西斯政权的《大独裁者》和揭露资本主义社会丑恶的《凡尔杜先生》、《舞台灯光》。正是在这个时期，卓别麟横遭美国右翼分子迫害，有人攻击他私生活不检点，有人莫须有地指责他支持共产主义。１９５２年卓别麟访问欧洲时，美国政府声称除非卓别麟接受对他私生活及政治观点的审查，否则他不能再回美国。卓别麟断然拒绝，从此定居瑞士。
    １９７２年卓别麟光荣地回到美国，接受因他“在本世纪对电影事业作出了无法估量的贡献”而颁授的荣誉奥斯卡金象奖，展览会展出了卓别麟那个几乎举世家喻户晓的流浪汉剧装、圆顶呢帽、竹手杖、窄上衣、肥大裤子和破皮鞋。
    整个４月，伦敦的国家电影剧院都将上演卓别麟的影片。英国的电视台今年１月已播放了《查理·卓别麟的青年时代》系列电视片，介绍了卓别麟早年在英国的艺术生活。
    此外，英国正在筹建卓别麟纪念馆及卓别麟电影资料馆。（附图片）
