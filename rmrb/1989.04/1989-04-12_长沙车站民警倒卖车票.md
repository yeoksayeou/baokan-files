	Police at Changsha Station Selling Train Tickets Illegally

	Last winter, I heard that some police officers at Changsha Railway Station were selling train tickets illegally, but I did not believe it. On February 15th at 19:40, I entered the ticket hall of Changsha Railway Station. Within five minutes, four scalpers approached me asking, "Do you need tickets?" I remained calm and observed them. I noticed that six or seven scalpers were very familiar with the police officers wearing badges numbered 0255414 and 0255104. These two police officers seemed to ignore the scalpers' illegal activities. At 20:25, the police officer with badge number 0255414 said to one of the scalpers, "I got you the tickets. Why didn't you come to get them?" He then whispered with the scalper at the refund counter. At 20:32, two college students bought tickets from a scalper. Each ticket for the second-class express train from Changsha to Beijing cost 40 yuan. A female college student asked the police officer with badge number 0255414, "Why don't you stop these scalpers?" The police officer replied rudely, "If you have a problem, bring them to me."

　　长沙车站民警倒卖车票
    去年冬天，我曾听说长沙火车站有的民警倒卖火车票，但一直不相信。今年二月十五日十九点四十分，我走进长沙火车站售票厅不到五分钟，先后就有四个票贩子问我：“要车票吗？”我不动声色地观察他们，发现有六七个票贩子同佩戴零二五五四一四、零二五五一零四号码的民警打得火热。这两位民警对票贩子倒卖车票的活动视而不见。二十点二十五分，零二五五四一四号民警对一个票贩子说：
  “我给你搞到了车票，你为何不来拿？”随后，他和那个票贩子在退票处耳语了一番。二十点三十二分，两位大学生向票贩子买票，每张长沙至北京的二次特快列车硬座票，票贩子索价四十元。一位女大学生对零二五五四一四号民警说：“这么多倒卖车票的，你为什么不管？”那位民警粗声粗气地说：“你有理，就把他们叫到我这里来。”
