A Spring Outing Bus Catches Fire in Donghai County

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, April 9th: At around 9 PM on April 8th, a minibus carrying 21 middle school students and teachers caught fire in the jurisdiction of Baitapu Township, Donghai County, Jiangsu Province. Five students and one teacher were burned to death, and nine others were injured.

It is understood that on the morning of the 8th, 21 students and teachers from Donghai County's Second Middle School rented a minibus from a local individual transporter to go on a spring outing to Lianyungang. They returned to Donghai County that evening. When the car reached the jurisdiction of Baitapu Township, the gasoline ran out. The students and teachers borrowed gasoline from nearby residents. However, the individual transporter driver, Zhang Xian, seriously violated operating procedures, causing a fire inside the car. Since the minibus, which was only supposed to carry 11 people, was overloaded with 22 people, many could not escape when the fire broke out.

Relevant authorities have warned that when organizing students to travel, all primary and secondary schools must pay attention to safety.

　　东海县一辆春游车失火
    据新华社南京４月９日电　４月８日晚９时左右，一辆载有２１名中学师生的面包车，在江苏东海县白塔埠乡境内起火，５名学生和１名教师被烧死，９人负伤。
    据了解，８日上午，东海县第二中学的２１名师生租用本县个体运输户的面包车到连云港春游，并于当天晚上返回东海县。当汽车开至白塔埠乡境内时，汽油耗尽。师生们下车向附近住户借来汽油。但个体运输司机张西安严重违反操作规程，引起车内失火。由于这辆规定只能乘坐１１人的面包车挤坐了２２人，当大火燃烧时来不及疏散。
    有关方面就此事警告说，各地中小学组织师生外出旅游，千万要注意安全。
