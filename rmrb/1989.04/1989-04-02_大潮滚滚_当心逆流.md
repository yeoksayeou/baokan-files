The United Nations Security Council's Resolution 435 on Namibian independence began implementation on April 1, marking the start of the independence process for the last remaining colony on the African continent.

The UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for Namibian Affairs, Martti Ahtisaari, arrived in Windhoek, the capital of Namibia, yesterday. He immediately began discussions with the Administrator-General of Namibia regarding related work. Today, he started his office in Windhoek headquarters and will soon tour various regions to oversee the progress of the independence process.

The first batch of the UN Transition Assistance Group for Namibia, consisting of over 1,000 military and civilian personnel, arrived in Namibia in batches by the end of March. This peacekeeping force, wearing their national uniforms and UN insignia, is now deploying to various locations. The remaining thousands of military and civilian personnel will arrive in Namibia in the coming days. The entire assistance group comprises 4,650 military personnel from 23 countries, 500 police officers, and 2,000 civilians. They will oversee the implementation of Resolution 435 over the next year, particularly the supervision of free and fair elections in Namibia.

This morning, a ceasefire officially took effect across Namibia, marking the first step in the independence process. The South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), which has been fighting against South African colonial rule for 23 years, declared an end to its armed struggle. SWAPO representatives have established an office in the Katutura black township of Windhoek to prepare for the upcoming elections.

According to Resolution 435, various political parties in Namibia will hold elections on November 1 to form a constituent assembly. The assembly will then draft a constitution and organize the first government of independent Namibia. Therefore, the outcome of the November elections is crucial for Namibia's future.

The main parties preparing to participate in the elections are SWAPO and the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA). SWAPO, established in 1960, has been fighting for Namibian independence and enjoys the support of the majority of Namibian blacks, as well as recognition from the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations. It is expected to win the elections. The DTA is a coalition formed in 1977 by the Republican Party and 10 other tribal political groups, with Dirk Mudde as its executive chairman.

However, South Africa is using various means to disrupt Namibia's free and fair elections and prevent SWAPO from winning, or at least from securing more than two-thirds of the seats in the constituent assembly. Firstly, the South African colonial authorities are drafting election laws to manipulate the election process. Additionally, the South African military is conducting voter registration, including non-Namibians such as some pro-South African Angolans and their relatives, even members of the South African military. The 35,000-strong territorial forces established by the South African authorities in Namibia are supposed to be disbanded by April 30, but the South African authorities have indicated that they will continue to pay them until the end of the year, allowing them to "peacefully" participate in the elections. The South African military is also bribing some Namibians not to vote for SWAPO in the upcoming elections. The notorious "riot police" of about 3,000 members are also being integrated into the police force to maintain order during the transitional period in Namibia, posing a direct threat to voters.

Moreover, some extreme right-wing white racist groups in Namibia are stockpiling weapons and openly declaring their intention to resist the UN and blacks by force.

This countercurrent within the tide of Namibian independence has alerted the international community and public opinion. SWAPO Chairman Sam Nujoma published an article in The New York Times yesterday, condemning South Africa's attempts to obstruct Namibian independence. At the same time, SWAPO is drafting policies to promote national reconciliation and establish a mixed economy to win the broadest support from the Namibian people. It is hoped that after a bumpy road, Namibia will declare independence as planned by this time next year. Independent Namibia will become the 160th member of the United Nations family, contributing to peace and stability in southwestern Africa. (Reported from the United Nations on April 1)

　　大潮滚滚　当心逆流

    联合国安理会关于纳米比亚独立的４３５号决议已于４月１日开始实施，非洲大陆上最后一块殖民地的独立进程开始了。
    联合国秘书长关于纳米比亚事务的特别代表马蒂·阿蒂萨利昨天抵达纳米比亚首府温得和克，当天就与纳米比亚行政长官商谈有关工作。他今天在温得和克总部开始办公，接着要巡视各个地区，监督独立进程的发展。
    联合国纳米比亚过渡时期援助团第一批先遣部队１０００多名军事和文职人员，已在３月底以前分批到达纳米比亚，这支身着本国军服、佩戴联合国标志的维持和平部队，现在开始向各地部署。援助团其余的数千名军事和文职人员，以后将陆续到达纳米比亚。整个援助团由来自２３个国家的４６５０名军事人员、５００名警察和２０００名文职人员组成。他们将在一年的过渡时期内，监督４３５号决议付诸实施，特别是监督纳米比亚各方进行自由和公正的选举。
    今日清晨，纳米比亚全境正式停火，这是纳米比亚独立进程的第一项措施。西南非洲人民组织（简称人组）反抗南非殖民统治长达２３年的武装斗争宣告结束。人组代表已在温得和克的卡图图拉的黑人居住区设立了办公室，筹备竞选事宜。
    根据４３５号决议，纳米比亚各党派将在今年１１月１日举行大选，成立立宪议会。接着由议会制订宪法，组织纳米比亚独立后的首届政府。所以，纳米比亚的前途如何，１１月大选是至关重要的。
    准备参加大选的主要党派是人组和“特恩哈尔民主联盟（简称民盟）。人组自１９６０年成立后，一直为纳米比亚的独立而斗争，得到纳米比亚广大黑人的支持和非洲统一组织及联合国的承认，可望在大选中获胜。民盟是白人共和党联合其它１０个部族政治集团于１９７７年组成，执行主席是共和党领袖德克·马奇。
    但是，南非却使用各种手段企图破坏纳米比亚自由、公正的选举，阻挠人组在选举中获胜，至少是不让他们在立宪议会中获得超过２／３的多数席位。首先，南非殖民当局在起草选举法，企图在选举程序上耍花招。另外，南非军队已在进行选民登记，把一些非纳米比亚人当做选民，其中包括一些亲南非的安哥拉人及其亲属，甚至还包括南非军队的成员。南非当局在纳米比亚建立的领土部队３５０００人，按规定应于４月３０日解散，但南非当局却表示要继续给他们发饷直到本年底，让他们“安心地”参加大选。南非军队还出钱收买一些纳米比亚人，叫他们在将来大选中不得投人组的票，臭名昭著的“镇暴部队”约有３０００人，也正在被并入警察部队，负责维持纳米比亚过渡时期的治安，对选民构成直接威胁。
    更有甚者，在纳米比亚的一些极右的种族主义白人团体，正在大量购买武器，公开声称要以武力“反对联合国和黑人”。
    这是纳米比亚独立潮流中的一股逆流，已引起国际社会和国际舆论的警惕。人组主席努乔马昨天在《纽约时报》上发表文章，谴责南非企图阻挠纳米比亚独立。同时，人组正酝酿提出促进民族和解、建立混合经济等施政纲领，以争取纳米比亚人民最广泛的支持。人们期望经过一段坎坷不平的道路后，到明年的今天，纳米比亚终将按计划宣告独立。独立后的纳米比亚将成为联合国大家庭中的第１６０名成员，为西南部非洲的和平与稳定做出贡献。（本报联合国４月１日电）
