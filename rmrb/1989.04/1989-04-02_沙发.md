	Sofa
	Gao Hongbo

	Whenever the topic of sofas comes up, people naturally feel a sense of comfort and ease. Indeed, this type of soft chair is one of the most ingenious designs humans have created for their bodies.

	There was a British man named Huxley who once made a lot of comments about the invention of the sofa. He basically said that an emperor's throne is far inferior to a sofa, but for the sake of dignity, the emperor would rather give up comfort. Initially, I agreed with Huxley's views. At the time, I was in a military camp in Yunnan, and my only possession was a folding chair. Sitting on this small chair, I couldn't experience the comfort of a sofa. But later, after seeing more, I realized it wasn't quite like that. Modern leaders sitting on sofas don't lose any of their dignity at all. Many important world and national affairs can also be discussed or decided on a sofa.

	This shows how quickly times change.

	However, sofas became common in China only in the past decade or so. After the "Ten Years of Turmoil," sofas began to appear in ordinary households, just like swallows returning to the mansions of the Wang and Xie families. And once they started appearing, they came in all sorts: luxurious, corner, multi-purpose, classical—all vying for attention with their soft, comfortable service, leading the trend in furniture. Young couples getting married rarely don't put a set of sofas in their new home, as if without the help of a sofa, the atmosphere of a new marriage would be gone. The importance of sofas is truly beyond what one might expect.

	I remember during the Cultural Revolution, a classmate of mine had an old sofa. This sofa was already quite worn out, and the springs had lost their elasticity, making it creak when you sat on it. But we still fought to sit on it. On this old sofa, a group of middle school students broke countless decks of playing cards! One day, it suddenly disappeared. It turned out that my classmate's parents were going to a May Seventh Cadre School, so they sold this ancient sofa to a second-hand furniture store. How much did they sell it for? Five yuan. Five yuan for the old sofa that had given us so much joy. At that time, this was a very fair price.

	Then I heard another sofa story: A poor carpenter, a bachelor, suddenly started frequenting a second-hand furniture store, specifically buying old sofas. He bought set after set and sold them one after another. The carpenter's behavior aroused the suspicion of the revolutionary masses, so he was taken to the police station. Under the power of the dictatorship of the proletariat, he admitted that he often found savings and gold jewelry hidden inside the old sofas.

	The carpenter's story might be a mockery of the idea that "the working class must lead everything." But ever since, I often think of a scene: In the dead of night, under dim light, a greedy person is dismantling one sofa after another, hoping to find a roll of cash or a few gold rings hidden under the cushions or among the springs...

	This has a bit of the character of figures from Balzac's novels. Old Grandet? Father Goriot? Uncle Pons? Does it resemble any of them? But this association in no way diminishes my admiration and fondness for sofas.

	After returning from Yunnan to Beijing, my first task was to start a family. Following local customs, my brother-in-law made me two sofas. These sofas were "fully upholstered," the most fashionable style in the late 1970s. They were designed to fit my body perfectly, with very high backs and very wide seats, using very little wood, exactly two single-person wooden beds. After the sofas were made, I tried to move them, but I almost hurt my back. They stood proudly in my room with their extremely large and heavy bodies, and stayed there for eight years.

	This July, when we moved to a new residence, my wife and I discussed updating the furniture, and the first thing to go was this pair of sturdy sofas. Sitting in their embrace, stroking the solid armrests, and gently touching the sofa covers my mother had carefully sewn, I felt a sense of guilt at the thought of parting with them. For eight years, these sofas had been the place where I sat to read, the hills where my little daughter climbed up and down, and even when my Persian cat was bored, they had to endure the scratches of its paws. What loyal friends they were!

	In the end, I still abandoned this pair of large sofas.

	Because the new house needed a set of sofas to match the built-in cabinet, I also yearned for a long sofa where I could lie down, just like the long sofa my classmate once had. My wish was easily fulfilled. At the sofa store on Xinjiekou, my wife and I successfully chose three sofas: one large and two small. Along with the beige sofa covers, we excitedly brought them back to the new residence.

	The arrival of the new sofas made my new home quite impressive. Friends who came to visit unanimously complimented: "It has the atmosphere of an office." I heard the black humor in their words, and the next day, I specially went to spy on the two meeting rooms in the office, only to find, to my regret, that they were all my new sofas' siblings. Not only were the styles identical, but the colors of the sofa covers were exactly the same, all produced in batches by the same factory.

	So, I began to miss my pair of friends that I had been with for eight years. Although they were bulky, they were still unique. The world lacks individuality, especially on our land.

### 沙发

　　沙发
    高洪波
    一谈起沙发，人们自然而然会感到某种惬意和舒适。的确，这种软椅子是人类为自己的躯体所进行的一种最聪明的设计。
    好像一位叫做赫胥黎的英国人，专门就沙发的发明大发过一番议论。大意是皇帝的宝座其实比沙发差远了，然而为了威严，皇帝宁可放弃舒服云云。初读赫氏高论，很以为然。因为读他的书时我尚在云南一座军营，唯一的财产是一把折叠靠背椅子，坐在这小矮椅子上自然感受不到坐沙发的滋味。可后来见得多了，才知道并非如此，现代的领袖们坐在沙发之上，威严丝毫不减少，许多世界及国家大事，也全可以在沙发上商量或决定的。
    可见时代变化之迅速。
    不过中国普及沙发，是近十几年的事。“十年浩劫”之后，沙发才像王谢堂前燕一样，飞入寻常百姓家。而且不飞则已，一飞惊人，各式各样的沙发：豪华型、拐角式、多用型、古典式，争奇斗艳，以自己软绵绵的服务，领家具之风骚。小青年结婚，极少有不在新房摆一套沙发的，仿佛没有沙发的帮助，新婚的气氛就荡然无存似的，沙发这么重要，真有些始料所不及。
    记得“文革”中，我的一位同学家摆着一只长沙发，这沙发已经很破旧了，弹簧也失去了弹性，坐上去吱吱直叫，但我们争坐不已。在这旧沙发上，一群中学生不知玩碎了几副扑克牌！突然一天它不在了，原来同学的父母要到干校，便把这古老的沙发送到了旧家具店。卖了多少钱？五元。五元钱卖掉了曾给予我们极大欢乐的旧沙发。那一时期，这已经是很公道的价钱了。
    紧接着我又听到一个沙发的故事：一个穷木匠，单身汉，突然十分频繁地在旧家具店里出入，专门购买旧沙发。他一套又一套地买到家，又一套接一套地卖掉。木匠的行为引起了革命群众的怀疑，于是将他扭送到派出所，在无产阶级专政的威力下，他承认旧沙发里时常发现存款和金银首饰。
    木匠的故事也许出于对“工人阶级必须领导一切”的嘲讽。不过，我自此之后常常想到一个情景：深夜里，幽暗的灯光下，一个贪婪的人拆弄着一只只旧沙发，希图从座垫下，弹簧中找出一卷钞票，几枚金戒指……
    这很有几分巴尔扎克笔下人物的风貌。老葛朗台？高老头？邦斯舅舅？像不像他们其中的某一位？但这种联想丝毫不影响我对沙发的倾慕与好感。
    从云南回到北京，首要的任务是成家，入乡随俗，我的妻兄为我打造了两只沙发。这沙发是“全包式”，七十年代末期顶时髦的一种款式。完全按照我的身材，设计了很高的椅背和很宽的座垫，所用的木料不多，整整两张单人木板床。沙发造好后我试图移动一下，结果差点闪了腰。它以极其巨大而沉重的躯体，雄峙在我的斗室里，并且一呆就是八年。
    今年七月份搬迁新居，妻和我商量更新家具，首当其冲的是这对雄赳赳的沙发。我坐在它的怀抱里，抚摸着结结实实的扶手，轻捻着妈妈精心缝制的沙发套，心头油然生出一种离别的内疚感。八年间，这沙发既是我安坐读书的所在，又是小女儿爬上爬下的山峦，甚至当我的波斯猫百无聊赖时，它们还要承担猫爪子的抓搔，真难为这一对忠实的朋友了！
    我终于还是遗弃了这对巨大的沙发。
    因为新屋需要一套与组合柜相对衬的沙发，我更渴望拥有一只可以躺卧的长沙发，像我的同学家曾有过的那只长沙发一样。我的愿望很轻易就实现了，在新街口的沙发店里，我和妻子顺利地挑选了一大两小的三只沙发。连米色的沙发套一起，兴冲冲地运回了新居。
    新沙发的到来，使我的新居气派不凡，到我家做客的朋友们一致恭维道：有办公室的气氛。我听出了话中的黑色幽默，第二天专门到机关的两处会议室窥探，结果不无遗憾地发现：这里全是我的新沙发的同胞兄弟。不但式样一模一样，连沙发套的颜色都分毫不差，原来是同一个厂家批量生产的货物。
    于是，我开始怀念起我那对相处了八年之久的朋友来。它们虽然笨重，但毕竟是别具一格的。世上缺少的就是个性，尤其在咱们这块土地上。
