The navigator Christopher Columbus is waving to people from the top of a tall tower. The sailboat that shared his hardships and glory is moored at the spot where he set sail, commissioned by the Queen of Spain, to discover new lands. From here, you drive around the mountain behind Columbus, as if the calm blue Mediterranean Sea is supporting you, and the palm trees embrace you. In just a few minutes, you will see a completely new world.

This is the construction site for the "Olympic City" for the 1992 Summer Olympics. Heavy trucks loaded with soil and stones rumble past, people wearing colorful safety helmets hurry by, and several large cranes stand tall against the blue sky. In the middle of the construction site, rectangular buildings are rising from the ground.

"How did Barcelona, the capital of Spain's Catalonia, manage to win the bid to host the 25th Olympic Games in such fierce competition? Did they use the 'back door' of Juan Antonio Samaranch, the current President of the International Olympic Committee and a Spaniard?" As soon as we entered the site, we asked the host this question with a "Chinese characteristic."

Smiling, Ms. Felice replied, "No." Later, during our meeting at the official residence, the President of the Catalonia region, Pujol, also denied it. But he added that they do have a good relationship with Samaranch, "If China wants to host the Olympics, we can help say a few words." After saying this, he seemed to emphasize seriously: "But this must not be reported."

Of course, this was just a light-hearted joke. Soon we understood why the International Olympic Committee was so fond of Barcelona. More than 50 years ago, Barcelona was already preparing to host the 1936 Olympics, with the main venues already built. However, due to the civil war, their ambitions were not realized. They had applied three more times to the International Olympic Committee, and this time they finally succeeded.

Now, we see that the entire "Olympic City" covers an area of 100 hectares, with an estimated investment of 30 billion pesetas (1 dollar is approximately 110 pesetas). Inside the city, there are 9 projects, with the main buildings being 4: a stadium, a gymnasium, a swimming pool, and a sports university. The designs for these projects were all selected from a global tender by the International Olympic Committee. The designers for the stadium and the gymnasium are from Italy and Japan, respectively.

The round-arched rectangular building on the construction site is the gymnasium where some indoor final events will be held during the 1992 Olympics. According to Ms. Felice, the construction of the gymnasium began in 1984, with an investment of 7 billion pesetas. The roof weighs 1,500 tons, is 45 meters high, and was assembled on the ground before being lifted in one go by 12 pillars. The roof tiles are the same color as the mountain, and the four corners and the east wall are all made of glass to maximize natural light. The interior facilities are complete, and an adjustable floor has been installed.

About 300 meters away from the gymnasium is the main stadium where the opening ceremony and football and track and field events will be held. It is rebuilt on the site of the stadium built for the 1936 Olympics, so the investment is relatively less, but it still amounts to 6 billion pesetas. The original stadium could only accommodate 35,000 people, but now it needs to seat 75,000. To save costs, the designer ingeniously dug down 11 meters without moving the walls, adding a layer underground. This way, although the track is slightly shorter, the entire stadium appears more compact and closer to the audience. Considering that the audience may not be full at times, the seat colors are different from the red, green, and blue of Seoul, using a light gray color. This way, even when the audience is sparse, the entire stadium will not appear empty.

The answer about the construction schedule surprised us. Both the stadium and the gymnasium will be basically completed by July this year and will host the European Cup track and field event in September. This may be to allow more time for pre-performance and testing of related facilities.

We, a group of guests from China, specifically asked about the funding situation for the Olympic project. Both Ms. Felice and Chairman Pujol answered with three words: "No problem." The funds for organizing the Olympics come from the central, provincial, and municipal governments. Notably, they do not pool the funds together for a big pot, but each level of government is responsible for different projects. For example, the funds for the stadium are provided by the Spanish central government; the funds for the sports university are allocated by the Catalonia regional government; the construction of the gymnasium is the responsibility of the Barcelona province and city; and the swimming pool is a renovation project completed by the city of Barcelona. The land used is also donated by the city without charge.

Outside the "Olympic City," there are two major projects 6 kilometers away on the Mediterranean coast: the Olympic Port, which is used to divert traffic and host various water sports, and the Olympic Village, which is for athletes and coaches to rest. Currently, the Olympic Port is nearly completed, while the Olympic Village, due to its location in an old industrial area, has a more complex construction and will be completed later. All facilities have considered their use after the games. For example, the water tower with a capacity of 60,000 cubic meters built in the European Square inside the "Olympic City" will be used for water supply in Barcelona after the Olympics. The expanded stadium will be used for training and matches by the Real Madrid Football Club and the Barcelona Football Club.

Indeed, for any city in the world, hosting the Olympics is not an easy task. We wish the uniquely charming city of Barcelona success.

### 访巴塞罗那“奥运城”

　　访巴塞罗那“奥运城”
    蒋亚平
    航海家哥伦布在高耸的塔顶向人们招手。与他同历艰险也共享盛誉的那艘帆船，静泊在当年他受西班牙女王之托去寻找新大陆的起锚点。由此出发，你驱车绕向哥伦布身后的山，仿佛蔚蓝静谧的地中海港湾在托举着你，波萝状棕榈树怀拥着你。不过十几分钟光景，你又将看到一个全新的世界。
    这里是为定于１９９２年召开的第二十五届奥运会而建的“奥运城”工地。一辆辆重型汽车满载土石隆隆驶过，头戴彩色安全帽的人们行色匆匆，几座大塔吊矗立蓝天。工地当中，一座座大的长方形建筑拔地而起。
    “作为西班牙加泰罗尼亚的首府巴塞罗那市，是如何在激烈竞争中获得举办第二十五届奥运会的荣幸？是不是走了身为西班牙人、现任国际奥委会主席萨马兰奇的‘后门’？”一踏入现场，我们就向接待人员端出了这个具有“中国特色”的问题。
    笑眯眯的费丽丝女士答了声“不”。稍后在官邸会见我们的加泰罗尼亚地区主席普约尔也予以否认。但他又说他们同萨马兰奇关系确实不错，“若中国要举办奥运会，我们可以帮着说说”。说完，他似乎又很认真地强调：“不过，这点绝不要见报。”
    自然，这只是一个轻松的玩笑。很快我们便明白了为何国际奥委会对巴塞罗那情有独锺。５０多年前，巴塞罗那本已准备举办１９３６年的第十一届奥运会，当时主要场地已经建成，后因国内爆发内战，“壮志未酬”。之后又曾三次向国际奥委会提出申请，这次终于“如愿以偿”。
    现在我们看到的整个“奥运城”占地１００公顷，预计投资３００亿比塞塔（１美元约等于１１０比塞塔）。城内建有９个项目，主要建筑有４个：体育场、体育馆、游泳馆和体育大学。这些项目的设计，都由国际奥委会在全世界招标，从中选定。体育场和体育馆的设计师分别为意大利人和日本人。
    工地上的圆拱顶长方形建筑，就是１９９２年奥运会用来举办一些室内项目决赛的体育馆。据费丽丝女士介绍，体育馆从１９８４年就开始动工，共投资７０亿比塞塔。馆顶有１５００吨重，４５米高，是在地面拼装好后用１２根支柱一次性顶上去的。屋顶琉璃瓦与山同色，四个角和东面墙壁全装玻璃，以充分采光。馆内设施齐全，并安装了活动地板。
    相距体育馆约３００米，便是举行开幕式和足球赛、田径赛的中心体育场。它是在为１９３６年奥运会建造的体育场旧址上重建的，所以投资要少一些，但也达６０亿比塞塔。原体育场只能容纳３．５万人，现在要求坐７．５万人。为了节省开支，设计师匠心独运，不动四壁，向下深挖１１米，在地下增加一层。这样，虽然跑道略短一些，却使整个体育场显得更为紧凑和接近观众。考虑到有时观众不能满座，座椅颜色不同于汉城的红、绿、蓝色，而用浅灰色。这样，即使观众少时整个体育场也不致显得稀落。
    关于工期的回答很使我们吃惊。体育场和体育馆都将于今年７月基本完工，并于９月在此举办欧洲杯田径赛。这也许是为了有更充分的时间对有关设施进行预演和检验。
    我们这批来自中国的客人，特意问到有关奥运工程的经费情况。费丽丝女士和普约尔主席的回答都是３个字：没问题。筹办奥运会的经费分别来自中央、地方四级政府。引人注意的是，他们不是把经费集中在一起做大锅饭，而是各包项目，如体育场所需资金由西班牙中央政府筹措；体育大学经费由加泰罗尼亚地区政府拨款；体育馆建设由巴塞罗那省、市负责；游泳馆是改建工程，由巴塞罗那市完成。所用地皮，也由该市无偿出让。
    “奥运城”以外，在６公里远的地中海岸边，还有两个大的工程，即用来疏通客流和举办各种水上运动的奥林匹克港，和供运动员、教练员休息的奥运村。目前，奥林匹克港已接近完工，奥运村因建在老工业区，工程复杂，完工时间晚一些。所有设施，都已考虑到赛后用途。如“奥运城”内欧洲广场中建的容量为６万立方米的水塔，待奥运会完后，将供巴塞罗纳市用水。扩建的体育场，则将供皇家马德里足球俱乐部和巴塞罗那足球俱乐部练球和比赛用。
    诚然，对世界上任何城市来说，筹办奥运会都不是一件轻而易举的事。我们预祝具有独特魅力的巴塞罗那市取得成功。
