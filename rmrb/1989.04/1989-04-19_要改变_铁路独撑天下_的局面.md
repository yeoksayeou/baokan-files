Title: To Change the Situation Where "Railways Bear All the Burden"

The railways are overcrowded. In 1987, the railways transported 1.1 billion passengers and 1.3 billion tons of cargo. On the main lines, a train passes every ten minutes, passenger cars have increased from 13 to 20 carriages, and 236 passengers are crammed into 118 seats, even the toilets have become "private compartments."

Some people might think this is a temporary situation. However, experts predict that in the next 10 years, both passenger and freight volumes will double. This means that even if the current level of congestion is maintained, railway transport volume will still need to double.

Since the construction of China's first railway in 1876, it has taken over a century to build the current 50,000-plus kilometers of railway. Although today's construction technology and capabilities are far superior to those of the past, it is impossible to complete such a massive project in just 10 years with the available manpower, resources, and finances.

I believe that to change the situation of tight and congested railway transport, the solution is to diversify transport modes—"rail (railways), road (highways), water (waterways), and air (civil aviation)"—and transform "rail transport" into "comprehensive transport," thereby changing the situation where "railways bear all the burden."

According to relevant statistics and analysis, in railway passenger transport, 42% of the average distance is within 149 kilometers; in freight transport, about 20% is within 100 kilometers for medium and short-distance transport. Within 200 kilometers, road transport is convenient and flexible and can fully handle the task. Of the 1.1 billion passengers transported by railways, 800 million should be transported by roads.

Roads have great potential. In China, with 1 million kilometers of roads, there are only 4 vehicles running on each kilometer. In countries with developed road transport, there can be dozens of vehicles per kilometer. It can be imagined that if we improve our road management level and solve the mixed traffic problem, roads can fully undertake the task of diverting railway traffic. Moreover, inland waterways also have potential.

Currently, the diversion is not effective due to several reasons. Road conditions are poor, vehicles are old; waterway routes are shortened, and channels are blocked. Additionally, transport prices have remained unchanged for a long time, with road transport prices being tens of times higher than railway prices. Naturally, goods and passengers are all crowded onto the railways. Therefore, we need to adjust prices, reduce medium and short-distance railway services, and increase investment in roads and waterways to achieve diversion.

### 要改变“铁路独撑天下”的局面

专栏：如何尽快改变滞后局面？——交通运输问题讨论

　　要改变“铁路独撑天下”的局面
    交通公路规划设计院工程师　周海涛
    铁路太挤了。１９８７年，铁路运送旅客１１亿人次、货物１３亿吨。干线上每十分钟就有一列火车通过，客车车厢从１３节加到２０节，１１８个座位挤着２３６个旅客，甚至连厕所也成了“包厢”。
    或许有人认为这是暂时的。但专家们的预测说明：今后１０年，客、货运量都将增加１倍。就是说，即使保持现在的拥挤程度，铁路运量还要增加１倍。
    从１８７６年我国第一条铁路建设至今，百余年时间才建成现在的５万多公里。尽管今天的建设技术与能力已非昔日可比，但要在１０年内完成如此庞大的工程，人力、物力、财力都不可能。
    我认为要改变铁路运输紧张、拥挤的状况，出路就是“铁（路）、公（路）、水（运）、民（航）”分流，变“铁交通”为“大交通”，改变“铁路独撑天下”的局面。
    据有关方面统计分析，铁路客运中，平均运距在１４９公里以内的占４２％；货运中，也有２０％左右是１００公里以内的中短途运输。而在２００公里以内，公路运输方便灵活，是完全可以胜任的。铁路完成的１１亿人客运中有８亿人应该由公路来完成。
    而公路大有潜力可挖。全国１００万公里公路，平均每公里公路上仅有４辆汽车在奔跑。公路运输发达的国家，可达到每公里几十辆汽车。可以设想，如果提高我们的公路管理水平，解决混合交通问题，公路完全可能承担铁路的分流。况且，内河水运也都有潜力可挖。
    现在分流“分”不出去，也有必然原因。公路路况差，车辆老旧；水运里程缩短，航道阻塞。加上运输价格比例长期不动，公路运价竟是铁路的十几倍，货物和旅客自然都挤上了铁路。这就要求我们调整运价，减少铁路中短途业务，并增加对公路、水运的投入，才可使分流实现。
