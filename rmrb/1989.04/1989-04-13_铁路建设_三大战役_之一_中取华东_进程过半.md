One of the "Three Major Battles" in railway construction during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period, the "Central to East China" project, has made significant progress in the over two years since it began. Recently, a reporter accompanied Vice Minister of Railways Sun Yongfu to the construction sites in East China and learned that the East China front has achieved breakthrough progress. The time and investment for the battle have both passed the halfway mark, and the engineering volume has also basically reached halfway. Currently, the construction of various major systems in this battle has been fully deployed, and some construction projects have been completed, easing the tense situation of railway transportation in this region to some extent.

The "Central to East China" project includes five major systems, requiring the construction of new lines, double-track lines, and electrified railways totaling 1,726 kilometers, with a total investment of 7 billion yuan, accounting for 1/5 of the national railway investment during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period.

According to the person in charge of the East China Railway Construction Command, by the end of 1988, a total of 3.723 billion yuan had been invested, accounting for 53.2% of the total investment. New lines totaling 313 kilometers, double-track lines totaling 210 kilometers, and electrified railways totaling 105 kilometers have been built. Among these, the Shanghai New Railway Station, the Fuyang-Huaian Line, the Fulijie Interchange Bridge, as well as the 105-kilometer electrified railway between Yong'an and Zhangping on the Yingxu Line and the Yingtan Hub, were all completed and put into use last year. The 129-kilometer Dashan Line on the East-West Corridor was fully paved at the beginning of last year, and major projects such as the Shuiyangjiang Grand Bridge, the Qianjiang Second Bridge in the Hangzhou Hub, the Wuyu Ferry, and the Huzhou Hub on the Xuanhang Line also began construction last year.

　　铁路建设“三大战役”之一
　　“中取华东”进程过半
    据新华社北京4月12日电　（记者杨理科）“七五”期间我国铁路建设“三大战役”之一的“中取华东”，开战两年多来究竟进展如何？最近记者随铁道部副部长孙永福到华东铁路建设工地采访了解到：华东战场已取得了突破性进展。战役的时间、投资都已过半，工程量也基本过半，目前，这个战役的各大系统工程的施工已全面铺开，部分建设项目已经竣工，使这一地区铁路运输的紧张状况有了一定缓解。
    “中取华东”包括五大系统工程，需修建新线、复线、电气化铁路共1726公里，总投资达70亿元，占“七五”期间全国铁路总投资的1／5。
    据华东铁路建设指挥部负责人介绍，截至1988年底，累计完成投资37.23亿元，占总投资的53.2％。已建新线3 13公里，复线210公里，电气化铁路105公里。其中，上海新客站、阜（阳）淮（南）线、符离集立交桥，以及鹰厦线永安至漳平间105公里电气化铁路和鹰潭枢纽已于去年先后建成，交付使用。东西二通道上的大沙线129公里于去年初全线铺通，宣杭线上控制工程水阳江特大桥、杭州枢纽的钱塘江二桥、芜裕轮渡、湖州枢纽等工程也于去年相继开工。
