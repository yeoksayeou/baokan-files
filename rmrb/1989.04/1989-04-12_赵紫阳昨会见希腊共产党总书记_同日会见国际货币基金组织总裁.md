	When discussing China's current economic adjustments, General Secretary Zhao said that China's future reform direction will still be to use more economic measures and fewer administrative methods. Currently, we are adopting some administrative measures in the process of rectification and adjustment, which is unavoidable and temporary. This does not mean that there is any change in China's reform direction and policies.

　　赵紫阳昨会见希腊共产党总书记
　　同日会见国际货币基金组织总裁
    本报北京４月１１日讯　记者顾玉清报道：今天下午４时，赵紫阳总书记在中南海会见了希腊共产党总书记哈里劳斯·弗洛拉基斯一行。
    赵总书记说，中希两党和两国人民在过去长期的斗争中建立起了诚挚的友好情谊。两年前，两党实现了关系正常化，双方关系有了新的发展。这次弗洛拉基斯同志的来访，为进一步增进中希两党之间的相互了解和友谊具有重要意义。
    赵总书记向客人介绍了我国的改革情况，弗洛拉基斯也向赵总书记介绍了希共的历史和希腊国内的情况。
    本报北京４月１１日讯　记者顾玉清报道：赵紫阳总书记今天下午在中南海会见了国际货币基金组织总裁米歇尔·康德苏一行。
    赵总书记谈到我国目前正在进行的经济调整时说，中国今后的改革方向还是要多用经济手段，少用行政办法，现在我们在治理整顿过程中采取一些行政办法是不得已的、暂时的。这绝不意味着中国的改革方向和方针有什么变化。
    康德苏总裁对我国在有秩序地进行经济调整的同时，还能保持一定的增长速度表示赞赏。他说，如果中国政府需要，国际货币基金组织将提供必要的援助。
    米歇尔·康德苏总裁一行是应国务委员兼中国人民银行行长李贵鲜邀请，前来我国访问的。
