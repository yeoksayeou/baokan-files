Reporter's Letter
Column: Investigation and Reflection

	The investigation by the city's Administration for Industry and Commerce shows that out of 55 stores in the urban area, 78% are engaged in the business of renting out counters, totaling 324 counters, with a monthly rental income of 130,000 yuan. The widespread practice of renting out counters has brought about the following negative effects:

	Firstly, the lack of clear markings leads to confusion. It was found that out of 39 stores with rented counters, 38 had no markings at all. Individual business households' rented counters are mixed in with state-owned and collective stores, attracting customers. Some renters take advantage of this to pass off inferior goods as superior ones, selling fake goods as genuine. Some renters harass, insult, or threaten customers, forcing them to buy goods; others deliberately destroy the store's markings for rented counters, seriously damaging the reputation of state-owned businesses.

	Secondly, there is a serious problem of unlicensed operations, multiple licenses for one stall, and tax evasion. According to the city's Administration for Industry and Commerce, out of 155 renters, 95 did not display their licenses, 16 operated without licenses, and 23 had multiple licenses for one stall. Some individual business households hold one license but operate in five stores. One individual in the Xinxing Store rented a counter and hired people to operate it, then rented 12 counters in the Hebian Street Store and hired four people to operate them. In July last year, relevant departments investigated the tax payment situation of renters. Out of 64 individual business households renting counters in four units in our city, including the Lantian Store, only 7 paid taxes according to the law, 11 paid the industrial and commercial management fee, and the rest paid nothing.

	Thirdly, renting out counters has a negative impact on store employees. Some commercial employees envy the high income of individual business households and are not content with their work in the stores.

	Therefore, it is urgent to strengthen the supervision and management of rented counters. I suggest that all units engaged in counter rental business should register and be approved by the local Administration for Industry and Commerce. The business scope of renters should not exceed the approved scope of the renting store. After renting out the counters, the relevant stores should take on the responsibility of supervision and management, set up clear rental markings, and formulate corresponding management systems. If renters operate illegally, relevant departments should seriously investigate and deal with them. Additionally, the rent should be approved by the local price department according to the actual situation, and the collected rent should be taxed according to regulations. The Administration for Industry and Commerce should include the management of counter rental business in the content of rectification and regulation, and take it seriously.

### 加强对“出租柜台”的监督管理

　　加强对“出租柜台”的监督管理
    我市工商行政管理局的调查表明，市区55个商店中，开展出租柜台业务的占78％，他们共出租柜台324个，月收租金13万元。大量开展出租柜台业务，带来了以下副作用：
    一、不设明显标记，以致鱼目混珠。经查证，39家有出租柜台的商店中，有38家无任何标记，个体工商户承租的柜台混杂于国营、集体商店之中，招揽生意。一些承租户乘机以次充好、以假充真，推销质次价高的商品。有的承租户刁难、谩骂、威胁顾客，强迫顾客购买商品；有的承租户故意毁掉商店标出的出租柜台标记，严重影响了国营商业的声誉。
    二、无证经营，一证多摊，偷税漏税严重。据市工商局对155个承租户调查，有95户未亮证经营，16户无证经营，23户一证多摊。有的个体户持一证，在5个商店租柜台经营。一个个体户在新星商店租了柜台雇人经营后，又在河边街商店租了12个柜台，雇佣4人经营。去年7月，有关部门对承租户纳税情况作了一次调查，在我市蓝天商店等4个单位承租柜台的64个个体户中，只有7户依法交纳了税款，11户交了工商管理费，其余分文未交。
    三、出租柜台给商店职工带来消极影响。有的商业职工眼红个体户的收入丰厚，因而不安心商店的工作。
    因此，加强对出租柜台的监督、管理已刻不容缓。我建议凡开展租赁柜台业务的单位，必须到当地工商行政管理部门进行登记、核准。承租者的经营项目不得超越出租柜台商店核准的经营范围，柜台出租后，有关商店应负起监督管理的责任，设置明显的租赁标志，制定相应的管理制度。如果承租者违章违法经营，有关部门应严肃查处。此外，租金应由当地物价部门根据实际情况审定，所收租金按规定纳税。工商行政管理部门要把对柜台租赁业务的管理作为治理、整顿的内容，认真抓好。
