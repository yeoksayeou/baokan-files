Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 24th.

Shanghai's procuratorial organs have, in the past half-year, investigated 109 cases of tax evasion and resistance to taxation based on reports. Of these, 95% involved individual households evading or resisting taxes, with one-third of these cases involving amounts over 100,000 yuan. Currently, 37 individuals who evaded or resisted taxes have been arrested. The tax authorities have already recovered over 10 million yuan in unpaid taxes.

It is understood that among the 110,000 individual households in the city, over 80% are involved in tax evasion or resistance. Among those operating without a license, the rate of tax evasion or resistance is even higher.

Individual transportation business owner Chen Jinqiao, from April to November last year, purchased bricks and tiles from outside Shanghai and sold them within the city, hiding a business turnover of 1.5 million yuan and evading 160,000 yuan in taxes.

Since September last year, Shanghai has, in accordance with the law, investigated and punished tax evasion and resistance. A total of 2,557 individual households have voluntarily declared and paid back taxes, amounting to 1.82 million yuan.

Jin Guoshan, a tax official from Wuchang County in Heilongjiang Province, recently received a two-year prison sentence for using his authority to help individual households evade taxes.

The 39-year-old Jin Guoshan was originally a tax official in the Lalin Township Tax Bureau of Wuchang County. Starting in 1985, he used various methods to help individual households evade taxes in exchange for bribes. From 1985 to 1989, he used his position to obtain four project contracts and settlement invoices for individual households, forged financial seals, and helped individual households evade nearly 100,000 yuan in taxes, collecting over 2,000 yuan in bribes. According to public reports, Jin Guoshan often used methods such as not issuing tax receipts to embezzle tax revenues and administrative fees, and overstepped his authority to extort property from rural individual households.
