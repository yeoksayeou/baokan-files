	Gorbachev Sets Off to Visit Cuba
	Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 2 (Reporter Zhu Chengjun) The General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Gorbachev, left Moscow today for Havana to make a four-day official friendly visit to Cuba. This is his first visit to this Latin American country.

	It is expected that he will hold talks with the Cuban leader Castro on the socialist construction of the two countries and issues of common interest. The trade volume between the Soviet Union and Cuba in 1988 was 7.5 billion rubles, with Cuba ranking sixth among the Soviet Union's foreign trade partners. However, the economic cooperation between the two countries has encountered some difficulties in recent years, such as the inability to fully utilize Soviet-aided projects. During Gorbachev's visit, the two sides may sign several documents to promote further development of economic cooperation between the two countries.

	En route to Cuba, Gorbachev will make a brief stop in Ireland and exchange views with Irish President Charles Haughey on the current international situation and bilateral relations. Although this meeting is very short, it is the first high-level contact between the two countries. Accompanying Gorbachev on the visit are Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze and CPSU Central Committee Politburo member Yakovlev, among others.

　　戈氏启程访古
    新华社莫斯科４月２日电  （记者竺承军）苏共中央总书记、苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席戈尔巴乔夫今天离开莫斯科前往哈瓦那，对古巴进行为期４天的正式友好访问，这也是他首次访问这个拉美国家。
    预计他将同古巴领导人卡斯特罗就两国的社会主义建设以及共同感兴趣的问题举行会谈。苏古１９８８年贸易额为７５亿卢布，古巴在苏联的对外贸易伙伴中占第６位。但两国经济合作近年也遇到一些困难，如苏联援建项目未能充分利用等。在戈尔巴乔夫访问期间，双方可能签署若干文件，以促进两国经济合作进一步发展。
    在赴古巴途中，戈尔巴乔夫将在爱尔兰作短暂停留，并与爱尔兰总理查尔斯·豪伊就当前国际形势和双边关系交换意见。这次会晤尽管时间很短，但却是两国间的首次高级接触。随同戈尔巴乔夫出访的有苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽和苏共中央政治局委员雅科夫列夫等。
