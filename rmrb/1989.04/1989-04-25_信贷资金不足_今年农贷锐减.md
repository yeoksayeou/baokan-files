Insufficient Credit Funds: Agricultural Loans Significantly Reduced This Year

    Today, China Agricultural Bank President Ma Yongwei revealed at a telephone conference held within the bank system that agricultural loans issued this year have significantly decreased compared to the same period last year. In the first quarter, the Agricultural Bank and credit cooperatives cumulatively issued 23.1 billion yuan in agricultural loans, which is 7.46 billion yuan less than the same period last year, amounting to 75% of last year's figure; net loans increased by 8.9 billion yuan, which is 5.6 billion yuan less than the same period last year, amounting to 61% of last year's figure.

    According to Ma Yongwei's analysis, the reasons for the reduction in agricultural loans include not only the normal factors of compressing household commercial and consumer loans but also the severe shortage of credit funds in rural areas. First, rural deposits are not increasing. In the first quarter, deposits in banks and credit cooperatives increased by 7.67 billion yuan less than the same period last year. The reasons for the decrease in deposits include the expansion of rural funds' "external circulation," the increase in the redemption of fixed-term savings certificates for the purchase of agricultural and sideline products last year compared to previous years, and the withdrawal of farmers' deposits for spring plowing before the Spring Festival. However, a significant factor is that the interest rates for deposits and loans in rural credit cooperatives are inverted, severely dampening the enthusiasm for organizing funds. Second, due to the slow turnover and settlement of agricultural and sideline products, the increase in the redemption of "white receipts" for the purchase of agricultural and sideline products last year, and the increase in prices, which correspondingly increases loan usage, the Agricultural Bank's loans for the purchase of agricultural and sideline products in the first quarter were 6.1 billion yuan less than the same period last year, reducing the available funds for the Agricultural Bank. Third, the repayment of funds to the People's Bank has increased.

　　信贷资金不足  今年农贷锐减
    本报北京４月２５日讯  记者江夏报道：今天，中国农业银行行长马永伟在农行系统召开的电话会议上透露：今年前三个月农业贷款投入比去年同期大为减少。一季度农行、信用社累计发放农业贷款２３１亿元，比去年同期少放７４．６亿元，为去年同期的７５％；贷款净增加８９亿元，比去年同期少增５６亿元，为去年同期的６１％。
    据马永伟分析，农业贷款少发放的原因，除压缩了农户工商业和消费性贷款等正常因素外，主要是农村信贷资金十分紧张。一是农村存款上不去。一季度行、社存款比去年同期少增加７６．７亿元。存款下降除了农村资金“体外循环”扩大，兑付去年收购农副产品的定活两便储蓄存单比往年多，春节前农民提取存款用于备耕等因素外，农村信用社存贷利率倒挂，组织资金的积极性受到严重挫伤是一个重要原因。二是由于农副产品调销缓慢、结算渠道不畅，兑付去年收购农副产品“白条”增多以及价格上涨，相应增加贷款占用等原因，使一季度农行农副产品收购贷款比去年同期少收回６１亿元，减少了农业银行的可用资金。三是归还人民银行资金增加。
