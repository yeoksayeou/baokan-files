In the afternoon of April 15, a sudden phone call brought the sad news of Comrade Hu Yaobang's passing. I couldn't believe my ears for a long time, but it was true. Reflecting on my growth over the years under Comrade Hu Yaobang's warm guidance and cultivation, and recalling his concern for the urban construction of Beijing, those unforgettable scenes that have passed, once again appear before my eyes...

Comrade Hu Yaobang had the people in his heart, maintained close ties with the people, and was very approachable. Therefore, there were many young friends like me. In early 1973, I served as the deputy manager of the Third Construction Engineering Company of Beijing. Sometimes I would visit his home. Generally, if it was after 11 a.m., regardless of whether the visitor was an official or a driver, they would definitely be invited to stay for a meal, and they had to sit at the same table. At the beginning, the drivers were quite tense and their expressions were not very natural. Comrade Hu Yaobang would joke, "You are the working class, right? Learn from the working class! Eating with the working class, I feel honored!" The atmosphere immediately became lively and relaxed. All the drivers who had visited his home were very moved: "Who would have thought that Comrade Hu Yaobang, with such a high position, had no airs at all!"

One Sunday morning in the summer of 1984, Li Hanping, a staff member of Comrade Hu Yaobang, called me and asked me to be at his home by 8 a.m. He arranged for a van, took me and the staff, and brought some drinks to inspect Shijingshan and Fangshan. At that time, I was the deputy mayor of Beijing. I thought about notifying the Public Security Bureau to bring two security personnel to accompany us. Comrade Hu Yaobang said to me, "Today, let's not talk about work, just a visit. You don't need to make any phone calls or notify any units, don't disturb their work and rest." I accompanied him to visit the streets and urban construction of Shijingshan District and observed the surrounding natural environment. Then, we drove to the Yanshan Petrochemical Company. Although it was a Sunday, in less than 15 minutes, the duty personnel used a walkie-talkie to gather Wu Yi, who was then the party secretary of the company and is now the deputy mayor of Beijing, and her team to the conference room. After listening to their report, Comrade Hu Yaobang happily said, "You are indeed a team that can be called upon and have combat effectiveness." Then, we went to Daxing County, where we saw the construction of the villages and towns and the fields. Comrade Hu Yaobang said to me, "Our country has little arable land. When building villages and towns, we must consider the characteristics of rural areas and occupy as little land as possible, and definitely not the good land. We must consider the population problem in our country and pay attention to environmental protection work."

In early August 1984, Comrade Hu Yaobang proposed to me that he wanted to see the construction of the San Yuan Interchange. I reported to him: Now many comrades are debating about whether Beijing should build 50-story buildings. Some comrades think that we should protect the ancient capital's appearance, and Beijing should not build high-rise buildings. Comrade Hu Yaobang thought for a moment and slowly said, "Beijing's high-rise buildings should not be built too many, but also should not be built at all. In short, build one or two, at most three, to show that our engineering and technical personnel have the ability and strength. We can consider building them in places a bit farther from the city center to protect the ancient capital's appearance."

### “今天不谈工作”

　　“今天不谈工作”
    ４月１５日下午，一阵急促的电话，送来耀邦同志不幸逝世的噩耗。我久久不敢相信自己的耳朵，然而，这却是真的。回顾自己多年来在耀邦同志亲切教育、培养下成长的历程，缅怀他对北京市城市建设的关怀，那逝去的、难忘的一幕幕，又重现在我的眼前……
    耀邦同志心里装着群众，密切联系群众，十分平易近人。因而，像我这样的青年朋友很多。１９７３年初，我担任北京市第三建筑工程公司副经理，有时去他家串门。一般情况，凡是超过上午１１点钟，来客不管是什么干部还是汽车司机，都一定要留下来吃饭，而且必须是同桌吃。开始，司机心情都较紧张，表情不大自然。耀邦同志就开玩笑：“你们是工人阶级嘛！向工人阶级学习嘛！同工人阶级一起吃饭，我感到光荣！”气氛一下子活跃、轻松了。凡去过他家的司机都十分感动：“没想到耀邦同志‘官’那么大，却一点官架子也没有！”
    １９８４年夏季的一个星期天清晨，耀邦同志身边的工作人员李汉平给我打来电话，要我８点钟赶到他家。他要了一辆面包车，带着我和工作人员并自备饮料去石景山、房山视察。我当时是北京市副市长，我想通知公安局带两名保卫人员随同。耀邦同志对我说：“今天不谈工作，只是参观，你就不要打电话，也不要通知任何单位，不要干扰人家的工作和休息。”我陪着他参观了石景山区的街道和城市建设，观看了周围的自然环境。接着，我们又驱车来到了燕山石化公司。虽然是星期天，不到１５分钟，值班人员用ＢＢ机就把担任公司党委书记、现在是北京市副市长的吴仪同志和她的一班人马召集到会议室。听了他们的汇报，耀邦同志高兴地说：“你们真是一支召之即来、有战斗力的队伍。”接着，我们又来到了大兴县，看了村镇的建设和一块块农田后，耀邦同志对我说：“我们国家农村的土地少，搞村镇建设一定要考虑农村的特点，尽量少占地，更不能占好地。要考虑到我国的人口问题，要注意搞好环境保护工作。”
    １９８４年８月上旬，耀邦同志向我提出要看一看三元立交桥的建设情况，我请示他说：现在许多同志对于北京市要盖５０层楼的建筑争论很大，一些同志认为要保护古都风貌，北京不能搞高层建筑。耀邦同志沉思片刻，缓缓地说：“北京的高层建筑不能多搞，也不能不搞。总之，搞它一两个，最多三个，显示我们工程技术人员有能力，有力量就行。可以考虑到离市中心远一点的地方去建设，要注意保护古都风貌。”
