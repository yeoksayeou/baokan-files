On April 14th of this year, China's population exceeded 1.1 billion. The population issue has cast a heavy shadow over the country. Feeding 1.1 billion people requires land. What is the current state of our land? I interviewed Wang Xianjin, Director of the State Land Administration.

"China's arable land carrying capacity is already at the critical point!" He bluntly expressed his strong sense of crisis as soon as he sat down. "We must completely change the old concept of 'vast territory and abundant resources' and firmly establish the awareness of 'many people and little land.'"

Behind him was a large map of China, showing the high-density population distribution in the eastern part and the overlapping mountains and vast deserts in the west. "One-third of our land is unusable. The total area of arable land is only 14% of the total land area. With an average of more than one mu of arable land per person, China ranks 67th in the world. Among countries with a population of over 500 million, China ranks third from the bottom in terms of per capita arable land, only higher than Bangladesh (1.395 mu) and Japan (0.54 mu). China, with 6.8% of the world's arable land, supports 21.8% of the world's population."

"Can we solve the population and land contradiction by developing new land resources?" I asked.

Wang Xianjin shook his head slightly, "China's land reserves are running out. Land that could be developed on a large scale in the 1950s is almost nonexistent, yet every year we still lose tens of millions of mu of arable land!" He gave me these figures: From 1949 to 1986, China reclaimed 377 million mu of land, but lost 611 million mu of arable land, resulting in a net loss of 234 million mu. After the promulgation of the Land Management Law, 12 million mu of arable land were still lost in 1987; the situation of arable land loss was still severe last year. In the past 40 years, China's population has increased by nearly 600 million. With the increase in population, the demand for construction land will also increase. If this trend continues, in 200 years, China will have no arable land left!

"How do we get out of this predicament?" I asked.

"There are certainly ways. The main thing is to do everything possible to reduce the birth rate. A research report from the Comprehensive Survey Commission of Natural Resources of the Chinese Academy of Sciences shows that China's land can support a maximum of 1.5 to 1.6 billion people. However, with the current birth rate, by 2050, China's population will reach 1.811 billion. At that time, 200 to 300 million people will have to rely on imported grain to meet their living needs, requiring an annual import of more than 100 million tons of grain. This is simply not possible. Therefore, we must make great efforts to control the population.

"Secondly, we must manage and utilize the existing arable land well, and do everything possible to preserve the existing arable land area. Controlling arable land and controlling population are equally important. If we expend great efforts to control the population but do not manage the land, it is equivalent to increasing the population again. The State Council promulgated the Land Management Law in 1987; last year, it also promulgated the Interim Regulations on the Tax on the Use of Arable Land and the Interim Regulations on the Tax on the Use of Urban Land. The State Land Administration is also formulating new regulations and rules to gradually improve and strengthen land management. At the same time, we must actively promote the comprehensive reform of the land use system and establish a self-discipline mechanism for cherishing and rationally utilizing land. In addition, opening up new sources, saving, developing science and technology, and so on, are all indispensable measures to solve the sharp contradictions between land and population."

Finally, Wang Xianjin said: "From now on, we must urgently strengthen national land awareness education for the whole people, so that every citizen, including middle and primary school students, understands China's land situation and jointly works to solve the potential land crisis. We, the people of this era, have the responsibility to protect this piece of land left by our ancestors!"

    明天是11亿人口日，每个中国人都该知道这一点：
　　我国耕地承载力近于临界状态
　　——访国家土地管理局局长王先进
　　王晓琨
    今年4月14日，我国人口突破11亿大关。人口问题给神州上空带来浓重的阴云。11亿人要吃饭，而解决吃饭问题离不开土地。我国土地状况目前怎样呢？我走访了国家土地管理局局长王先进。
    “我国耕地承载力已经处于临界状态！”落座后，他开门见山地道出强烈的忧患感。“我们必须彻底转变‘地大物博’的旧观念，牢固确立‘人多地少’的意识。”
    他的背后有一幅巨型中国地图，显示着我国东部高密度的人口分布和西部的重山叠嶂、大片沙漠。“我国有1／3的土地不能利用，耕地总面积仅占国土总面积的14％。人均一亩多耕地，位居世界第67位。在世界人口5000万以上的国家中，我国人均耕地为倒数第3位，仅高于孟加拉（1.395亩）、日本（0.54亩）。我国以占世界6.8％的耕地生活着占世界21.8％的人口。”
    “能不能通过开发新的土地资源来解决人口和土地的矛盾呢？”我问道。
    王先进微微摇了摇头，“我国土地后备资源不多了，像50年代可供大面积开发的荒地几乎没有，可每年还要减少上千万亩耕地！”他给我列举了这样的数字：从1949年到1986年，我国累计开荒造田3.77亿亩，而累计减少耕地6.11亿亩，净减少耕地2.34亿亩。《土地管理法》颁布后，1987年耕地仍减少1200多万亩；去年耕地减少情况依然严重。而40年中，我国人口增长近6亿。人口增多，建设用地也要增长。照这样的速度，耕地、人口反向发展下去，200年以后，我国将无地可耕！
    “如何冲出困境呢？”我问。
    “办法当然是有的。主要是千方百计降低人口出生率。中国科学院自然资源综合考察委员会提供的研究报告表明：我国土地最高的承载量估算可生活15亿到16亿人口。而按目前的人口出生率，到2050年我国人口将达到18.11亿，届时要有2亿到3亿人靠进口粮食解决生活所需，每年共需进口1亿多吨粮食。这是根本办不到的。所以，必须以极大的努力控制人口。
    “其次，要管好用好现有耕地，千方百计保住现有耕地面积。控制耕地和控制人口具有同等意义，费了九牛二虎之力控制人口，如果土地没有管住，就等于把人口又升了上去。国务院1987年颁布了《土地管理法》；去年又颁布《耕地占用税暂行条例》和《城镇土地使用税暂行条例》。国家土地管理局还在陆续制定新的法规条例，以逐步完善和强化土地管理。同时，我们要积极推进土地使用制度的全面改革，建立珍惜和合理利用土地的自我约束机制。另外，开源节流，发展科学技术等等，都是解决土地和人口尖锐矛盾的不可缺少的措施。”
    最后，王先进说：“从现在起，要刻不容缓地加强全民国土观念教育，使全国每个公民，包括中、小学生都了解我国土地国情，共同努力解决潜在的土地危机问题。我们现时代人，有责任保护好祖先留下的这一片土地！”
