Currently, some cotton farmers in our region are unwilling to sell cotton to the state. Farmers in Xujin County have over 50,000 piculs of cotton in storage, while farmers in Wucheng County have over 20,000 piculs. The main reason is that the cotton procurement stations, after receiving the cotton from the farmers, are unable to pay in cash. Some farmers complain: "Last year's promissory notes weren't honored, and now there's no money for selling cotton. Tell me to plant more cotton this year? First pay me for last year's cotton."

It is understood that last year, Xujin County owed farmers 8.6 million yuan in cotton sales proceeds, and Wucheng County owed 1.02 million yuan, neither of which have been settled to this day. Insufficient procurement funds are troubling both the cotton procurement departments and the farmers.

In order to motivate farmers to plant cotton, we suggest that relevant departments should find ways to return the cotton sales proceeds to the farmers and expedite the procurement of stored cotton. When relevant departments sign cotton procurement contracts with farmers, they should have the contracts notarized by a public notary, so that both the cotton sellers and buyers have legal recourse and neither party loses trust. For the state's cotton procurement tasks, a quota system should be implemented. For cotton beyond the procurement quota, the state should purchase it at a higher price, or allow farmers to trade freely.

### “要俺今年多种棉  先还去年棉花钱”

　　“要俺今年多种棉  先还去年棉花钱”
    目前，我地区一些棉农不愿向国家交售棉花。夏津县棉农家有存棉５万多担，武城县棉农家有存棉２万多担。主要原因是，棉花收购站收了农民出售的棉花后，不能支付现金。有的农民抱怨说：“去年白条不兑现，现在卖棉没有钱，要俺今年多种棉，先还去年棉花钱。”
    据了解，去年，夏津县欠棉农售棉款８６０万元，武城县欠棉农售棉款１０２万元，至今还没兑现。收购资金不足困扰着棉花收购部门和棉农。
    为了调动棉农种棉积极性，我们建议，有关部门应想方设法归还棉农的卖棉款，尽快收购存棉。有关部门与棉农签订棉花收购合同时，应经公证部门公证，使棉花收售双方都有法可依，互不失信。对棉花征购任务实行包干，征购任务以外的棉花，国家应加价收购，或允许棉农自由交易。
