Israeli Prime Minister Shamir is currently visiting the United States. Not long ago, Egyptian President Mubarak visited the U.S. ahead of him. In a few days, Jordanian King Hussein will follow suit. Washington is quite lively, temporarily becoming the center for discussing the Middle East situation. However, people are more concerned about Shamir's attitude. Under the pressure of the U.S. "demand to improve the status quo," what kind of "peace plan" has this Israeli government leader brought?

In the past, due to the stalemate in the Middle East, the Reagan administration's policy was to "take one step and see," clearly showing a "not in a hurry" attitude. However, the Middle East situation has developed rapidly in recent times, not allowing the new Bush administration to dawdle. Since the U.S. and the PLO began talks last December, no substantial progress has been made. The PLO and Israel have expressed dissatisfaction with the U.S. from different perspectives. Arab countries complain that the U.S. is too cautious and lacks courage. EEC countries are eager to try, and their tone is clearly higher than that of the U.S. The Soviet Union has returned to the Middle East in the role of a mediator. Especially, the anti-Israeli struggle of the Palestinians in the occupied territories has continued to rise after entering its 16th month. Even U.S. public opinion has criticized the Middle East peace process for stumbling. The U.S. government may have realized that this situation is not advantageous for U.S. diplomacy. Therefore, the Bush administration took the opportunity of Israeli Foreign Minister Arens' visit to the U.S. last month to ask him to convey to Shamir that this visit to Washington must bring a new "peace plan."

Although Shamir's visit has not yet ended, he has already held talks with President Bush and Secretary of State Baker, and the content of the "peace plan" has been largely revealed. This is to hold elections under Israeli supervision in the occupied territories, with the elected representatives then negotiating with the Israeli authorities; to allow Palestinians to implement limited self-rule; but this must be on the condition that the Palestinians in the occupied territories stop their anti-Israeli struggle. As for the international community's concern about requiring Israel to end its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and to convene an international Middle East conference, Shamir still insists on his past stance, not budging an inch.

Regarding this new plan, the U.S. has expressed support, while the PLO has rejected it. The new plan is actually not new, at least Shamir has repeated it several times. Those who pay attention can see at a glance that the key to this new plan is to stop the uprising of the Palestinians in the occupied territories. As for the "elections," Egyptian newspapers believe that "the residents of the West Bank and Gaza Strip have already agreed that the PLO is their legitimate representative," and there is no need to start a new stove. In short, this plan is just a delaying tactic to buy time.

The U.S.-Israel talks this time also exposed some differences. The biggest difference lies in the fact that the U.S. hopes Israel will end its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and implement the principle of "land for peace." This time, the U.S. proposed "neither supporting an independent Palestinian state nor supporting Israel's sovereignty or permanent occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip," which is similar to the past proposal of "ensuring Israel's security and safeguarding the legitimate political rights of the Palestinians." It seems that the U.S. is taking a neutral stance towards both the Palestinians and Israelis. According to Western public opinion, it wants to make the "PLO and Israel more or less equal." This is undoubtedly a progress compared to the past when it simply favored one side, and it is also beneficial for promoting the Middle East peace process. Of course, whether the U.S. is fair on this issue remains to be seen. What people are dissatisfied with is that the U.S. does not put enough pressure on Israel, causing this "strategic partner" to drag its feet in the Middle East peace process.

Under pressure from all sides, Shamir is also a bit stubborn. He has to do something for Middle East peace, such as recently releasing 474 Palestinians detained in Israeli-occupied areas, expressing his willingness to engage in direct talks with Arab countries under the participation of the United Nations, and conditionally partially withdrawing occupying troops from the occupied territories. However, because he has not made concessions on the key issues related to Middle East peace, people are clearly disappointed with his visit to the U.S. Interestingly, just as he was talking with Bush in the White House, two peace demonstration groups were marching outside, one group of American Jews demanding that Israel implement the "land for peace" policy, and the other group of Palestinians demanding that Israel "stop killing Palestinians." It can be seen that the momentum of the Middle East peace process is strong, and even within Israel, the call for talks with the PLO is growing. "Those who know the times are heroes," Shamir had better not become an obstacle to the Middle East peace process.

　　夹缝中的沙米尔
　　柯月霖
    以色列总理沙米尔目前正在美国访问。不久前，埃及总统穆巴拉克先期访问了美国。再过几天，约旦国王侯赛因将接踵而至。华盛顿好生热闹，一时成了讨论中东局势的中心。不过，人们关心的还是沙米尔的态度，在受到美国“要求改善现状”的压力后，这位以色列政府领导人究竟带来了一个什么样的“和平方案”？
    过去由于中东局势僵持不下，里根政府的政策采取的是“走一步，瞧一步”的政策，明显地表现“不着急”。但中东局势近个时期来发展很快，由不得布什新政府再慢吞吞地踱方步。自去年１２月美巴开始对话以来，因为没有取得实质性进展，巴解和以色列从不同立场表示对美国不满。阿拉伯国家埋怨美国谨慎有余，魄力不够。欧共体国家跃跃欲试，调门明显比美国高出一筹。苏联以调解人姿态重返中东。特别是被占领土巴勒斯坦人的反以斗争在进入第１６个月后继续高涨。连美国舆论也对中东和平进程趔趄不前啧有烦言。美国政府可能认识到，这种局面对美国外交是不利的，于是，布什政府趁以色列外长阿伦斯上月访美之便，要他传话给沙米尔，这次来华盛顿务必带上新的“和平方案”。
    尽管沙米尔的访问尚未结束，但他已经同布什总统和贝克国务卿会谈过，“和平方案”的内容大体上也已透露，这就是在被占领土举行在以色列监督下的选举，选出的代表再与以色列当局谈判；允许巴勒斯坦人实行有限自治；但必须以被占领土巴勒斯坦人停止反以斗争为条件。至于国际社会关注的要求以色列结束对西岸和加沙地带的占领和召开中东国际和会，沙米尔仍然坚持过去的主张，一点也没有松口。
    对于这个新方案，美国表示支持，巴解组织则予以拒绝。新方案其实并不新，至少在沙米尔口中已反复提过好几次。细心人一眼就能看出，这个新方案的要害是要被占领土的巴勒斯坦人停止起义。至于“选举”，埃及报纸认为“西岸和加沙地带的居民早已同意巴解组织是他们的合法代表”，大可不必再起新的炉灶。说穿了，这个方案无非是为了要赢得喘息时间的缓兵之计。
    美以的这次会谈也暴露出了分歧。最大的分歧在于，美国希望以色列结束对西岸和加沙地带的占领，实行“土地换和平”的原则。美国这次提出的“既不支持一个独立的巴勒斯坦国，也不支持以色列对西岸和加沙地带拥有主权或永久占领”，与过去提过的“既要确保以色列的安全，又要维护巴勒斯坦的合法政治权利”一样，似乎对巴以双方采取不偏不倚的态度，按照西方舆论的说法，要使“巴解组织和以色列或多或少地处于并列的地位”。这比过去单纯袒护一方无疑是个进步，对推动中东和平进程也是有利的。当然，美国在这个问题上是否公正，还有待观察。人们对美国不满的是，它对以色列施加压力不够，致使这个“战略伙伴”拖了中东和平进程的后腿。
    沙米尔在各方压力下，也有点顽而难固了。他不得不为中东和平做些事，如最近释放了关押在以色列占领区的４７４名巴勒斯坦人，表示愿意在联合国参与下与阿拉伯国家进行直接和谈，有条件地部分撤出被占领土的占领军，然而，因为他在有关中东和平的关键问题上没有作出让步，人们对他这次美国之行明显地表示失望。有趣的是，正当他在白宫同布什会谈时，外面却行进着两个和平示威队伍，一队为美国犹太人要求以色列执行“土地换和平”的政策，另一队是巴勒斯坦人要求以色列“停止杀害巴勒斯坦人”。可见，中东和平进程势头很猛，即便在以色列国内，主张同巴解谈判的呼声也日益高涨。“识时务者为俊杰”，沙米尔最好不要成为中东和平进程的绊脚石。
