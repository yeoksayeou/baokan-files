Foreign companies criticize the investment environment in Shekou. The newspaper publicly exposes the issues to promote improvement.

	The chairman of Shekou Industrial Zone, Yuan Gang, recently commented on a series of criticisms from several foreign oil companies operating in Shekou regarding the investment environment. He wrote on an internal memo, "Reading this memo makes one feel truly sad, to the point of wanting to cry but having no tears!" He suggested publicly exposing these issues to raise awareness. It is reported that the *Shekou Newsletter* published this matter on April 10 in a prominent position.

	According to the internal memo, these foreign oil companies provided feedback on the security, water supply, communications, personnel quality, and pricing in the industrial zone when consulted by relevant departments in Shekou.

	An American company reported that a couple living in the Whale Mountain Villa had their home burglarized twice within a week. A Japanese company also reported that foreign employees living in the Whale Mountain Villa for over a year had been experiencing unclean tap water, sometimes with a brownish color. They installed a filter, but a month later, the water turned black.

	Regarding communications, foreign employees complained about poor line quality, often unable to contact their company headquarters or family. Additionally, these companies reported that the personnel provided by Shekou had low quality.

	The editor's note in the memo pointed out that the issues raised by the foreign oil companies are mostly long-standing problems that have not been resolved. If these issues are not addressed promptly, they will inevitably affect the confidence of foreign investors.

　　外商批评蛇口投资环境
　　报纸公开亮丑以促改进
    本报深圳4月10日电　蛇口工业区董事长袁庚，就多家驻蛇口的外国石油公司办事机构最近对工业区投资环境提出尖锐批评一事，日前在工业区一份内部情况简报上批示说，看了这份简报，真叫人难过，欲哭无泪！他建议公开这一丑闻，以唤起警醒。据悉，《蛇口通讯报》已于10日在显要位置上披露了此事。
    据这份内部简报称，这些外国石油公司是在蛇口有关部门主动征询意见时，就工业区的治安、供水、通讯、人员素质和物价等方面提出批评的。
    美国某公司反映，住在鲸山别墅的一对美籍夫妇，家中七天之内两次被盗。日本另一公司也反映，外籍人员在鲸山别墅住了一年多，自来水一直不清洁，有时水呈棕褐色。他们自装过滤器，一月后即为黑色。
    在通讯方面，外籍人员则抱怨线路不畅，常常无法与公司总部或家人联系。此外，这些公司还反映蛇口方面为他们提供的工作人员素质不高。
    《简报》的编者按指出，外国石油公司反映的这些意见，大多是长期没解决的问题，若长期不加以解决，势必会影响外商投资的信心。（朱葆春）
