Title: Defeat is an Opportunity to Rise Again

Flowers of glory and celebratory wine are often given to the victors. However, Mr. Chen Yushu from Hong Kong presented a plaque to the Chinese men's table tennis team for their "thorough defeat" in the 40th World Table Tennis Championships. Mr. Chen's thoughtful gesture is commendable.

In competitive sports, while it is said that "victory and defeat are common in warfare," it is still true that "it is better to win than to lose." Although a few years ago the Swedish table tennis team's strength was on par with ours, the outcome of the match was that we won. "One victory covers a multitude of sins." The shine of the trophy and the fragrance of the flowers made us overlook the weaknesses and problems we had discovered, and we lacked the urgency to address them immediately. This time, with a "thorough defeat," we truly tasted the bitterness of losing.

However, a "thorough defeat" also harbors a danger: it can lead to the opposite extreme, where we doubt our own strengths and abilities, and even consider our "victories" as "failures." The various discussions about whether the Chinese table tennis team is still capable are casting a heavy psychological shadow over the team. Mr. Chen, at this critical moment, presented a plaque with the words "Strive for Excellence, Revive the Spirit" to the Chinese men's table tennis team, which is deeply meaningful. Encouragement, warmth, and support for those who have failed or are facing difficulties are more precious than praise, enthusiasm, and rewards for the victors. People often pay more attention to the latter while neglecting the former. Mr. Chen's gesture of offering a cup of wine to the defeated is even more sincere and heartfelt.

　　败军尤贵思奋起
    晨星
    光荣花、祝贺酒，常常是送给胜利者的。香港陈玉书先生则为在第四十届世乒赛中“失败得比较彻底”的中国男子乒乓球队赠匾。陈先生用心之良苦，值得称道。
    竞技比赛，虽有“胜败乃兵家常事”之说，毕竟“好输不如赖赢”。尽管几年前瑞典乒乓球队实力与我已在伯仲之间，但比赛结果是我们赢了。“一俊遮百丑”。奖杯的光芒，鲜花的芳香，使我们对已经发现的弱点和察觉到的问题，缺乏一种切肤之痛，未能当即下决心去克服。这次“失败得比较彻底”，才使我们真正尝到了败军的滋味。
    然而，“失败得比较彻底”，也潜伏着一种危险，那就是容易走向另一个极端：对自己的长处和实力也怀疑起来，把“俊俏”也当成“丑”了。“中国乒乓球队还行不行”的种种议论，正在给乒乓球队蒙上一层沉重的心理阴影。陈先生正值此时，以“励精图治，重振雄风”的匾赠与中国乒乓球男队，可谓情深意长。对失败者、困难者的鼓励、温暖和支持，比对胜利者的称赞、热情和嘉奖更显珍贵。人们常常重视后者而忽略前者。陈先生为失败者敬上一杯酒，这酒更醇更香更知己。
