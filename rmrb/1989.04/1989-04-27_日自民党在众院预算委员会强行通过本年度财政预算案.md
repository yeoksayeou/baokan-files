Japanese Liberal Democratic Party Forces Through Fiscal Budget for the Year in the House of Representatives Budget Committee

	This reporter, Yu Qing, reports from Tokyo on April 27: The Liberal Democratic Party of Japan today morning held a separate vote in the House of Representatives Budget Committee and forced through the fiscal budget for 1989. The opposition parties did not attend the deliberation and voting.

	The usual procedure for the Japanese Diet to deliberate and pass important bills is to first deliberate in the committees under the House of Representatives, and then submit them to the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors. Today, the Liberal Democratic Party forced through the budget in the House of Representatives Budget Committee, indicating that the Liberal Democratic Party will not heed the opposition parties' objections and will take similar actions in the House of Representatives. However, there is no precedent for the budget being forced through in the House of Representatives. Some within the Liberal Democratic Party advocate for caution and to avoid forcing it through unilaterally as much as possible. Due to the approaching date of May 28 for the Diet's adjournment, and the need for a 30-day natural establishment period from the House of Representatives to the House of Councillors, the majority in the Liberal Democratic Party advocate for the budget to be passed in the House of Representatives by May 28 at all costs, to avoid further chaos from the extension of the Diet's session.

	The opposition parties unanimously and strongly oppose the Liberal Democratic Party's actions, deeming it a violent act that violates parliamentary political norms.

　　日自民党在众院预算委员会强行通过本年度财政预算案
    本报东京４月２７日电  记者于青报道：日本自民党今天上午在众院预算委员会单独表决，强行通过了１９８９年度预算案。在野党没有出席审议和表决。
    日本国会审议通过重要议案的程序，通常是先在众院下属的委员会进行，然后提交众院和参院。今天自民党在众院预算委员会强行通过预算案，预示自民党将不顾在野党反对，在众院也将采取同样行动。但是，预算案在众院强行通过还无先例。自民党内有人主张对此应该慎重，尽量避免单独强行通过。由于５月２８日国会闭会的日期临近，从众院通过到参院通过需要３０天的自然成立期。因此，自民党多数人主张２８日无论如何也要在众院通过预算案，以避免因国会会期延长而招致更多混乱。
    在野党对自民党的举动一致强烈反对，认为这是违反议会政治常识的暴举。
