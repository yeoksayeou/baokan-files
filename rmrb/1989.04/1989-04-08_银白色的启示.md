	The Silver White Revelation
	Pú Shí

	No one expected that the 17-year-old Belgian player Philippe Saive would consecutively defeat two main players from the Chinese team. The seemingly unknown Soviet team turned defeat into victory, eliminating the highly favored South Korean team, and creating a major upset. The Swedish team defeated the Chinese team 5-0, reclaiming the Swaythling Cup after 16 years.

	The events that occurred in the men's team competition of the 40th World Table Tennis Championships seem to suggest and confirm something to the people.

	Facing the challenges from the European and Asian powers, the Chinese table tennis community often says, "The wolves are coming." Now it seems that the entire Asian style of play is facing the threat of "the wolves are coming."

	The Japanese men's and women's teams, who once dominated the world table tennis scene, were both pushed down to sixth place this time. The loop technique they invented has become an effective weapon for European players against Asian players. The changes in the strengths and weaknesses of the European and Asian powers reflect that the direct grip, near-table fast attack style, which is mainly used, urgently needs improvement, innovation, and perfection. Minor adjustments and minor innovations will not eliminate the threat of "the wolves are coming." What is needed is a major breakthrough in technology, like when the Japanese team invented the loop ball, or like the European team learning the loop ball, "using the enemy's tactics to defeat them." The European powerhouses have also experienced the pressure and threat from the Asian teams, striving for innovation, and thus achieving a slightly advantageous result in today's competition with the Asian teams. It is precisely because of this that the world of table tennis has further developed.

	Table tennis is always round. It brings the winners the trophy and flowers, and it brings the losers enlightenment and hope.

　　银白色的启示
　　普石
    谁也没想到，比利时队年仅十七岁的菲利普·塞依夫接连从中国队两员主将手中夺得两分。默默无闻的苏联队反败为胜，淘汰了夺魁呼声甚高的南朝鲜队，爆出冷门。瑞典队以五比零战胜中国队，夺回阔别了十六年的斯韦思林杯。
    第四十届世乒赛男子团体赛发生的这些事件似乎在向人们暗示着，同时也在证实着什么。
    我国乒乓球界面对来自欧亚诸强的挑战，常常爱说“狼来了”。现在看来，整个亚洲型打法都面临着“狼来了”的威胁。
    曾经威震世界乒坛的日本男女队这次双双被挤到了第六名。他们发明的弧圈球技术，倒成了欧洲选手对付亚洲选手的有效武器。欧亚诸强此长彼消的变化，反映出在技术风格和打法上，以直握球拍为主的近台快攻型打法急需改进、创新和完善。小修小补，小创小改，难以解除“狼来了”的威胁，需要像当年日本队发明弧圈球那样，在技术上有重大突破，或是像欧洲队学弧圈球那样，“以其人之道，还治其人之身”。欧洲强队同样是经历了亚洲队的压力和威胁之后，努力创新，才又取得了今天同亚洲队较量中略占上风的结果。世界乒乓球运动正是因此得到了进一步发展。
    乒乓球永远是圆的，它给胜利者带来奖杯和鲜花，也给失败者送去启迪和希望。
