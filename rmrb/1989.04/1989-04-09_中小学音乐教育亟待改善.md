Currently, many regions have a severe problem with students who are tone-deaf or semi-tone-deaf. Recent surveys by cultural and educational departments in Zhejiang of some primary and secondary schools in Hangzhou have confirmed this.

Relevant departments conducted a music aptitude test on 2,192 first-year junior high school students from 172 primary schools. From the test papers, it was evident that many students did not know the composer of the national anthem of the People's Republic of China. Beethoven became "Beidou Feng," Xian Xinghai became "Xin Xin Hai," Nie Er became "Nier," and Hua Yanjun (Abing) became "Laowai." In the singing form section, some filled in "low voice, middle voice, high voice," and some even wrote "sitting and singing, standing and singing, walking and singing"… Various strange answers made people laugh. The test results showed that only 1.5% of the students scored an A in music foundation knowledge, 29.2% scored a B, while 51% scored a C, and 18.3% of the students scored a D.

This aptitude test reflected that students' knowledge of music is narrow, and their ability to read sheet music is poor. They lack basic pitch and rhythm, and many students do not understand this auditory art of music.

The reason for this is the long-term neglect and underestimation of music education. Many teachers, parents, students, and even leaders believe that music classes do not affect academic performance or employment, so they naturally belong to "minor subjects." Additionally, many schools lack professionally trained full-time music teachers, and music classes are taught by teachers from other subjects. This inevitably affects the quality of teaching.

Relevant departments should pay attention to this issue to generally improve the music literacy of young people nationwide.

### 中小学音乐教育亟待改善

　　中小学音乐教育亟待改善
    目前，不少地区中小学生音盲、半音盲的情况相当严重。最近浙江文化、教育部门对杭州的一些中小学的调查，就证实了这一点。
    有关部门对来自１７２所小学的２１９２名初一新生进行音乐素质测试，从答卷看，不少学生不知道中华人民共和国国歌的作曲者；贝多芬成了“北斗风”，冼星海成了“细心海”，聂耳成了“泥尔”，华彦钧（阿炳）成了“老外”；在演唱形式一栏中，有的填写“低音、中音、高音”，有的甚至写成“坐着唱、站着唱、走着唱”……种种奇怪的答卷，让人忍俊不禁。测试结果，学生中音乐基础知识得Ａ等的仅占１．５％，Ｂ等的占２９．２％，而Ｃ等的竟占了５１％，还有１８．３％的学生得了Ｄ等。
    这次素质测试反映出学生的音乐知识面很窄，识谱能力也很差，缺乏起码的音准和节奏感，许多学生对音乐这门听觉艺术听而不懂。
    其原因，是长期以来忽视、轻视音乐教育。不少教师、家长、学生乃至领导认为，音乐课不会影响升学、就业，理所当然地属于“副科”。再加上不少学校缺乏受过专业培养的专职音乐教师，音乐课由其他学科的教师兼任。这就势必影响教学质量。
    有关部门对此问题应引起关注，以求普遍地提高全国青少年的音乐素质。
