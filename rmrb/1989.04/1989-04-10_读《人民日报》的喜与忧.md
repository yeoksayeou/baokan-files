Title: The Joy and Worry of Reading the People's Daily

I truly count myself as a long-time reader of the People's Daily. After the significant "adjustment" in newspaper prices, the family indeed debated for several rounds about which newspapers to "reduce." In the end, the "one-person decision" method was the easiest, and I didn't bother to listen to the differing opinions of my wife and children, drawing the circle myself and keeping the People's Daily first.

"Is it just the People's Daily that has the 'courage' you admire?" My wife, who never forgets her intellectual identity, is a bit resentful about reducing the "intellectual newspaper" she prefers.

"Who really has the courage? Who dares to have the courage?" My son-in-law always leans towards his mother-in-law.

The most cutting remark comes from my daughter: "What's with the 'daring to speak or not daring to speak'? It's just because the People's Daily is willing to publish your troublesome articles. Other newspapers won't publish them. Applause on the stage, self-comfort!"

Laugh or criticize as they may, I'll read the newspaper myself, as long as the "subscription power" is in my hands, that's enough.

However, since the newspaper's reform, the status of the People's Daily in our home has also changed. First, it was my son-in-law; he began to take an interest in the "Our Report" section of the international news page, "It's good that it's not just a reprint of Xinhua News Agency's dispatches!" My wife has always loved reading Yang Rong: "I don't understand the scholarship, but look at the writing, it's not necessarily worse than your Qian Zhongshu?" She also started coming to my desk to find "Seven Flavors of Book Talk." The most active is my second daughter: "You all have plenty of time, this newspaper belongs to me after work!" Seeing these differing opinions turn around, I felt a sense of camaraderie—these few dozen yuan (my youngest daughter said: "It's my monthly salary!") for a subscription to the newspaper is not just me "consuming" it, I can't help but feel secretly pleased—this is what is called joy.

But (another but), tonight (March 23rd) after dinner, the situation showed signs of "reversal." The little maid brought up today's People's Daily from downstairs, my wife quickly grabbed it, spreading out pages two and three, and she exclaimed:

"Come and see! The headline on the right side of page three—

"'The Joy and Worry of Citizens Suing Officials,' the title is not bad, right? First, comparing a flower to a beautiful woman, right? Then look, the headline on the right side of page two—

"'The Joy and Worry of Leaders Paying Attention,' the second comparison of a flower to a beautiful woman. There's a third one too—

"'The Joy and Worry of Old Masters.' Hey hey, hahaha!"

"Really, all 'joy and worry,' 'joy and worry,' 'joy and worry'!"

"Are the editors and reporters out of other words?"

I took the newspaper and stared. My son-in-law, who never forgets to show his humor:

"After all, facing such a great situation, who doesn't feel joy? And there are still so many problems, who doesn't feel worry? Naturally, it's 'joy and worry,' what else can be written?"

"You're not a loyal reader? Write an article yourself, join the fun, haha!"

I didn't bother to respond, just went into the room, closed the door, and sat at the desk. I turned on the lamp, habitually wanting to browse the newspaper first, but today's newspaper was still in their hands. I randomly picked up a newspaper from two days ago (March 21st) from the small table beside the desk, and it was another headline, "The Joy and Worry of the Vanguard," what's going on, I've encountered it again! I pulled out another one from below, it was from the 12th, "Talking About the Joy and Worry of Forestry," another headline, really strange, cough!

The discussion outside the door continued. I wanted to go get the newspaper to read, but I was afraid it would lead to more ridicule. Unconsciously, I wanted to defend the newspaper, but this headline is really so coincidental... Is there no other word in the world..." I became irritated, spread out the paper, took out a pen, and wrote this essay on reading the newspaper: "Joy and Worry."

　　读《人民日报》的喜与忧
    钟叔河
    我真算是《人民日报》数十年的老读者了。报刊订价大幅度“调整”以后，究竟“压缩”哪几种报刊，全家确实争论过好几回。结果还是“一言堂”的办法省事，懒得听持不同意见的老婆孩子嘀咕，由我画圈，首先留下《人民日报》。
    “就只《人民日报》有你赏识的‘文胆’？”老婆念念不忘她的知识分子身份，对压缩掉她偏爱的“知识分子报纸”有些忿忿。
    “谁真有胆？谁又能有胆？”女婿总偏向丈母娘。
    最尖刻的是女儿：“什么敢言不敢言罗？还不是因为《人民日报》肯登你那些找麻烦的文章。人家报纸就不登。戏台里喝采，自我安慰！”
    笑骂由他笑骂，报纸我自看之，只要“订报权”握在我手里，这就得了。
    可是，自从改版以来，《人民日报》在我们家的地位也随之有了改变。首先是女婿，他对国际新闻版的“本报讯”开始发生兴趣，“不是新华社新闻稿的翻版就好！”老婆向来爱读杨绛：“学问我反正不懂，瞧这文笔，未必就比不上你的钱钟书？”她也开始到我桌上来寻《七味书谭》了。最活跃的还是二姑娘：“你们多的是时间，这报，下了班当然属于我罗！”
    看到这些持不同意见者转变立场，自觉吾道不孤，这几十大洋（小女儿说：“是我一个月的工资！”）订的一份报纸毕竟不是我一个人在“消费”，不禁窃喜——此其所谓喜。
    可是（又一个可是），今天（３月２３日）晚饭后，形势又出现了“逆转”的苗头。小保姆到楼下把当天的《人民日报》拿上来，老婆捷手先得，把二、三版一展开，她连呼啧啧了：
    “快来看呀！三版右上这个头条——
    “‘民告官的喜与忧’，标题不赖，第一个以花比美人，是不？再看，二版右上这个头条——
    “‘领导重视的喜与忧’，第二个以花比美人了。还有第三个哩——
    “‘老国手的喜与忧’。嘿嘿，哈哈哈哈！”
    “真的，都是‘喜与忧’、‘喜与忧’、‘喜与忧’！”
    “编辑记者就没有别的词儿啦？”
    我接过报纸一看，干瞪眼。女婿从不忘记表现他的幽默：
    “本来嘛，面对如此大好形势，谁人不喜？又还存在这么不多不少的问题，又谁人不忧呢？自然是‘喜与忧’罗，还能标出别的？”
    “你不是忠实读者吗？也写上一篇，凑凑热闹，哈哈！”
    懒得搭理，干脆进房，掩上房门，坐到桌前。开了台灯，习惯性地想先浏览一下报纸，可今天的报纸还在他们手里。便从桌旁矮几上随手拿起一张前天（３月２１日）的报纸，又是一个头条，“排头兵的喜与忧”，怎么搞的，又碰上了！再从下面些抽出一张，是１２日的，“谈谈林业的喜与忧”，又是头条，真见鬼了，咳！
    门外的议论还在继续。想去拿报纸看，又怕引起更大的奚落。下意识地想为报纸辩解，但这标题也真是这么凑巧……难道天下之大，就此一词……”我不禁烦躁起来，铺开纸，抽出笔，写下这篇读报八股：《喜与忧》。
