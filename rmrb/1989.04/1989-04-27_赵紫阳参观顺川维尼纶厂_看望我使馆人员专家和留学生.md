Zhao Ziyang Visits Suncheon Vinylon Factory

Zhao Ziyang, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, visited the Suncheon Vinylon Integrated Enterprise, the largest economic construction project in North Korea at present, on the morning of April 27th. He praised North Korea's efforts in developing the chemical fiber industry using local resources.

The enterprise, known as the "new fiber city," uses North Korea's abundant limestone and anthracite as the main raw materials to produce vinylon and other chemical products. After its completion in 1990, it is planned to produce 100,000 tons of calcium carbide, 10,000 tons of vinylon, 90,000 tons of nitrogen fertilizer, and 30,000 tons of feed annually. Currently, the enterprise has built over 200 facilities and has started trial production of calcium carbide and vinylon.

At 9:35 AM, Zhao Ziyang and his delegation first arrived at the observation tower to overlook the layout of the enterprise. The manager of the integrated enterprise, Xu Zaihong, provided a detailed introduction to the construction of the enterprise. Pointing to a nearby mountain range, he said, "Those mountains are limestone mountains, and the upper layer contains abundant anthracite." Zhao Ziyang commented, "That's good, it allows for local resource utilization." He then visited the vinylon spinning workshop.

During the visit, Zhao Ziyang showed interest in the enterprise's production of protein feed using methanol. He asked, "How much methanol is needed to produce one ton of feed?" The host replied, "Two tons of methanol can produce one ton of feed." Zhao Ziyang added, "That's good, but I am not an expert. As far as I know, China's methanol production is also significant, and it can be utilized in the future to produce protein feed."

After the visit, a North Korean journalist said, "General Secretary Zhao is very knowledgeable about the economy and asked many practical questions."

The North Korean leaders accompanying Zhao Ziyang's delegation included Li Zhongyu, Xu Xiu, Cui Guang, and Xu Yunsi.

Zhao Ziyang Meets Chinese Embassy Staff, Experts, and Students

Despite his busy schedule, Zhao Ziyang, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, took time on the afternoon of April 27th to visit the Chinese Embassy in North Korea. He met with all embassy staff, experts, technical personnel working in North Korea, and Chinese students studying in North Korea.

He encouraged the embassy staff, experts, and students to work and study hard to contribute to Sino-North Korean friendship.

　　赵紫阳参观顺川维尼纶厂    
    看望我使馆人员专家和留学生
    本报平壤４月２７日电  记者徐宝康报道：赵紫阳总书记一行今天上午参观了朝鲜目前最大的经济重点建设项目——顺川维尼纶联合企业，并对朝鲜“就地取材”发展化纤工业表示赞赏。
    被誉为新兴“化纤城”的这家联合企业，以朝鲜丰富的石灰石和无烟煤为主要原料生产维尼纶和其他化工产品。１９９０年投产后，计划每年生产１００万吨电石、１０万吨维尼纶、９０万吨氮肥、３０万吨饲料。目前，该企业已建成大小２００多座设施，并试生产电石和维尼纶。
    ９点３５分，赵紫阳一行首先来到瞭望塔，俯瞰企业布局。联合企业经理徐载弘详细介绍了企业建设情况后，指着不远一片山峦说，“那些山都是石灰山，上府埋有丰富的无烟煤”。赵紫阳说：“这不错，可以就地取材”。然后参观了维尼纶纺纱车间。
    参观过程中，赵紫阳对该企业用甲醇生产蛋白质饲料发生了兴趣。他问：“一吨饲料，需要多少甲醇？”主人说：“２吨甲醇可以生产１吨饲料。”赵紫阳又说：“这很好，不过我是外行，据我所知，中国甲醇的产量也不少，今后可以把它利用起来生产蛋白质饲料。”
    参观后，朝鲜一位记者说：“赵总书记对经济很懂行，提了许多实实在在的问题。”
    陪同赵紫阳一行参观的朝鲜领导人有：李钟玉、许锬、崔光、徐允锡等。
    本报平壤４月２７日电　记者徐宝康报道：中共中央总书记赵紫阳今天下午在访问百忙之中，抽出时间前往中国驻朝鲜大使馆，看望全体使馆工作人员以及在朝鲜工作的专家、技术工作人员和在朝鲜学习的留学生。
    他勉励使馆工作人员、专家和留学生努力工作和学习为中朝友谊作出贡献。
