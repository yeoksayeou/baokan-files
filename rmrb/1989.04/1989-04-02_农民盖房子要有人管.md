Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, approximately 9 million households, accounting for about 5% of the total rural households, have been renovating or building new houses each year, totaling 600 to 700 million square meters. By the end of 1987, the total area of rural housing nationwide reached 56 billion square meters, increasing the per capita housing area from 11 square meters in 1978 to 19 square meters. However, due to poor construction equipment and low-quality craftsmen, collapses and accidents have frequently occurred. Therefore, strengthening the management of rural housing construction has become urgent.

From a survey of 1,764 completed and ongoing projects in 118 towns across 35 counties in 9 provinces, including Guangdong and Fujian, over the past three years, only 30.5% met quality standards, while 69.5% were substandard. Many households have demolished old houses to build new ones, only to find that the new ones are dangerous. They have spent a lot of money but still feel insecure. Therefore, it is necessary to take effective measures to ensure the interests and safety of households.

Firstly, it is essential to eliminate unlicensed designers and unqualified builders. Among the 1,764 projects surveyed, 50.6% were designed without a license, and 38% were constructed without a permit. Most private residences were built without any design, merely copying from others. The entire construction process was often done by relatives and neighbors, lacking scientific methods. This approach, relying solely on experience and ignoring science, must be stopped as it is harmful to both individuals and society.

Secondly, the quality of the rural construction workforce needs to be improved. It is necessary to adopt multi-channel, multi-level training methods to enhance the technical capabilities of the rural construction workforce and to strengthen safety and quality education and vocational training for construction workers.

Thirdly, it is crucial to establish a robust village and town building quality supervision system. Wujiang County implements a three-stage inspection system (foundation, mid-term, and final inspection) for ongoing rural housing projects, requiring the signatures of the household head, craftsmen, and inspectors for each inspection to be valid. This method is worth learning from.

Finally, creating a favorable external environment, rectifying the construction market, and ensuring the quality of building materials and equipment are prerequisites for the quality of village and town housing construction to pass inspection.

In summary, the quality of rural housing affects millions of households and is related to public safety. Local governments should strengthen management and not take this issue lightly.

　　农民盖房子要有人管
    十一届三中全会以来，每年都有占农村总户数５％左右的９００多万农户改建和新建农房达６─７亿平方米。到１９８７年底，全国共建农房达５６亿平方米，由１９７８年的人均住房面积１１平方米增至１９平方米。然而，由于建筑装备简陋，工匠素质较差等原因，塌房和伤亡事故屡有发生。这样，强化农房建设管理就显得迫在眉睫。
    从对广东、福建等九省的４市３５县１１８个镇近三年来竣工和在建工程１７６４项的调查来看：符合质量标准的仅占３０．５％，不合格率竟达６９．５％。不少农户拆了旧房建新房，建了新房是危房，花费了不少钱财，却惶惶无宁日，缺乏安全感。因此，必须采取有力措施，确保农户的利益和安全。
    首先，要取缔无证设计和无照施工者。上述１７６４个建设项目中，无证设计的占５０．６％；无照施工的占３８％。大部分私人住宅则根本未经设计，纯系依葫芦画瓢，仿建于他人。整个施工过程更是亲帮亲、邻帮邻，缺少科学性。这种只凭经验，无视科学的施工方法害人害己，不能再继续下去了。
    其次，农村建筑队伍的素质急待提高。要采取多渠道、多层次的培训方法，加强农村建筑队伍的技术力量；同时，强化安全质量教育和施工人员的业务训练。
    再次，要健全村镇建筑质量监督职能。吴江县实行建管站对在建农房三次验收（基础、中验、竣验），每次验收均须经户主、工匠、验收人签字后才生效，这种办法可资借鉴。
    最后，创造良好的外部环境，整顿建筑市场，保证建筑材料和设备的质量，则构成村镇房屋建设质量过关的前提。
    总之，农房质量维系千万农户，关乎大众安危，各地政府应加强管理，切不可等闲视之。
