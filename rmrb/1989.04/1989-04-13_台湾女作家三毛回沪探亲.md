After a separation of 40 years, the renowned Taiwanese female writer Sanmao finally returned to her hometown of Shanghai.

Sanmao made this trip specifically to visit her "father," Zhang Leiping. They began corresponding last summer. Today, in the small "bedroom" prepared by her "father," Sanmao enthusiastically discussed the origin of her pen name: "'Sanmao' is the first small character I encountered in literature. I am also a small person. After getting married, I became a housewife and feared that I couldn't keep up with the world's daily developments, so I decided to write some articles. However, my writing style at that time was completely different from my teenage works like 'The Rainy Season Will Never Return.' I decided to hide behind a new name. I didn't want my pen name to be too elegant, so I immediately thought of 'Sanmao'."

After meeting Zhang Leiping, Sanmao immediately had the idea to write a biographical essay about him. She hopes to visit Shanghai every year and plans to rent a small room to work on this project.

"Cultural exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are absolutely a good thing." After being separated from the mainland for 40 years, Taiwanese writer Gao Yang said this to reporters during his first visit to the mainland.

　　台湾女作家三毛回沪探亲
    新华社上海电　（实习生朱丹）时隔40年之后，台湾著名女作家三毛日前终于回到了故乡上海。
    三毛这次是专程来看望“爸爸”张乐平的，去年夏天他们之间开始通信。今天，在“爸爸”准备的小“闺房”里，三毛兴致勃勃地谈起了她取名的来由：“‘三毛’是我今生所认识的文章中的第一个小人物。我也是个小人物，结婚以后做了家庭主妇，怕自己跟不上外面每天都在发展的世界，才想到写些文章。但当时我的文风跟少女时写的《雨季不再来》之类完全不同了，便决定把自己藏在一个新名字后面。我不想让笔名太风雅了，于是立刻就想到了‘三毛’”。
    三毛这次见到张乐平后，随即萌生了为他写一部散文体传记的念头。她希望自己以后每年都能到上海来，打算租一间小屋子来做这一工作。
    新华社上海电　（记者严卫民、通讯员吴树香）“海峡两岸的文化交往，绝对是一件好事。”阔别大陆40年后第一次访问大陆的台湾作家高阳，对记者这样说。
