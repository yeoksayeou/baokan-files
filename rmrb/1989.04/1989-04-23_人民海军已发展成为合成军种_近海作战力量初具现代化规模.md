The People's Navy today marks its 40th anniversary. Admiral Zhang Lianzhong, Commander of the Navy, told reporters that the People's Navy has developed from a single-service force at its inception into a combined-arms service with surface ships, submarines, naval aviation, coastal defense, and marine corps. It has formed a modernized near-sea combat force.

Admiral Zhang Lianzhong said that the Navy is developing towards missile, electronic, nuclear, and automated construction. Currently, the number of major combat vessels in service has increased nearly tenfold compared to the 1950s. The surface ship fleet is equipped with missile destroyers, missile frigates, missile boats, anti-submarine vessels, minesweepers, and landing ships; the submarine fleet's conventional submarines are equipped with missiles and possess self-designed and manufactured nuclear submarines; the aviation fleet's aircraft are transitioning from shore-based general-purpose aircraft to naval specialized aircraft, and has established a multi-type aviation force including bombers, fighters, attack helicopters, transports, and seaplanes; the coastal defense force has upgraded from self-made dual-barrel automatic large-caliber coastal guns to various new types of shore-to-ship missiles. Several successful trials of missile submarines launching ballistic missiles underwater and new aircraft carrier landing tests signify that China's scientific and technological advancements and naval equipment have reached a new level. The Navy now has nearly twice the tonnage of various service ships compared to a decade ago, initially forming a sea support system. In the past decade, the Navy has completed over 6,000 scientific research and innovation projects based on its original foundation, with 1,200 items receiving national scientific and technological progress awards or military scientific and technological achievement awards. Additionally, it has constructed over 700 coastal defense projects, with 14 of them reaching domestic advanced levels.

Zhang Lianzhong said that the Navy's military training reforms have made new progress. Various units have implemented classified and categorized training for ships, established ship training centers, implemented officer training qualification assessments, and built training regulations. While strengthening basic training, they are gradually developing multi-service and multi-arm joint training. Long-distance training has transitioned from single-service to multi-service joint training with tactical backgrounds. In the past decade, hundreds of ships have participated in long-distance training, enhancing the fleet's ability to navigate the open seas and conduct joint operations.

Admiral Zhang Lianzhong said that the Navy has always attached great importance to the construction of academies, treating them as the cradle and base for cultivating and training cadres. Currently, the Navy has 13 academies, providing a large number of morally, intellectually, and physically developed military and political command cadres and professional technical talents for the modernization of the Navy.

　　人民海军已发展成为合成军种
    近海作战力量初具现代化规模
    新华社北京４月２３日电（记者黄彩虹）人民海军今天迎来了成立４０周年纪念日。海军司令员张连忠中将对记者说，人民海军已从初建时的单一兵种，发展成为一支拥有水面舰艇、潜艇、海军航空兵、海军岸防兵和海军陆战队等诸兵种合成的军种，形成了初具现代化规模的近海作战力量。
    张连忠司令员说，海军正在向导弹化、电子化、核能化、自动化建设的方向发展。目前在海军服役的各类主要作战舰艇的数量，比５０年代增加了近１０倍。其中水面舰艇部队已装备了导弹驱逐舰、导弹护卫舰、导弹艇、猎潜艇、扫雷舰、登陆舰等舰种；潜艇部队的常规动力潜艇也装备了导弹，并拥有自己设计制造的核潜艇；航空兵部队的飞机正在从岸基通用飞机向海军专用飞机发展，并已建成一支拥有轰炸、歼击、强击、直升、运输、水上飞机等多机种的航空部队；岸防部队装备从自制双管自动大口径海岸炮，发展到多种新式岸舰导弹；先后几次进行的导弹潜艇水下发射运载火箭和新型机种着舰试验成功等，标志着我国科学技术和海军装备已达到一个新的水平。海军现有各类勤务船只的吨位比１０年前增加了近两倍，初步形成了海上保障体系。近１０年来，海军在原有基础上已完成科研、革新项目６０００多个，有１２００多项获国家科技进步奖或全军科技成果奖，同时还建设各类海防工程７００多项，其中的１４项达到了国内先进水平。
    张连忠说，海军的军事训练改革取得了新的进展。各部队实行了舰艇分级分类训练、组建舰艇训练中心、实行军官训练合格考核制度和训练法规建设等，在加强基础训练的同时逐步发展成多舰种多兵种的合同训练；远航训练也由单舰种向多舰种带战术背景的远航合练发展。近１０年来，已有几百艘次舰船参加了远航训练，提高了部队远海航行和合同作战能力。
    张连忠司令员说，海军历来十分重视院校建设，把院校作为培养训练干部的摇篮和基地。现在，海军已有１３所院校，为海军现代化建设输送了大批德智体全面发展的军政指挥干部和专业技术人才。
