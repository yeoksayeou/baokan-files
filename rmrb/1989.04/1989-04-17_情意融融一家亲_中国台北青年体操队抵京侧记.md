In the dazzling glow of flashbulbs, a new chapter in sports exchanges across the Taiwan Strait began to unfold.

At around 4 PM on April 17, a 27-member youth gymnastics team from Chinese Taipei arrived at the capital's airport satellite hall. More than a hundred domestic and foreign reporters, who had been waiting there to record this historic moment, formed an impromptu grand welcoming ceremony. They swarmed forward, their arms holding microphones and tape recorders like a forest sprouting from the ground. An official from the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee, team leader Zhan Déjī, excitedly said, "I never imagined the welcoming scene would be so grand." Team leader Zhuāng Xiùshí turned around and pulled a young team member from behind, jokingly saying, "They are all at a loss in this big scene for the first time." Passengers at the airport, both domestic and foreign, were also drawn to the scene and took out their cameras to join the ranks of the reporters. Amidst the lively atmosphere, the officials of the Chinese Taipei youth gymnastics team answered the reporters' questions one by one.

Zhuāng Xiùshí frankly said: "Currently, the level of gymnastics in Asia is developing rapidly. In comparison, our level is not high, but we have confidence in entering the top ranks in some individual events in the upcoming Asian Youth Championships." He then confirmed a statement made by a Taiwanese reporter, "Given this situation, we plan to invite high-level mainland gymnastics coaches to Taipei to teach, so as to quickly improve our sports level." He said, "He is equally confident about this, believing that the two sides' Olympic committees will reach an agreement on this matter. Because being able to come to Beijing this time is the best example. As long as we sit down and talk, there is no obstacle that cannot be removed."

Team leader Zhan Déjī also detailed the team's specific arrangements in Beijing, saying, "We will do our best to participate in the competition, but after the competition, we plan to let the young team members visit the Great Wall, the Ming Tombs, and the Forbidden City. Additionally, we hope to observe the upcoming China Cup International Gymnastics Competition."

　　情意融融一家亲
  　——中国台北青年体操队抵京侧记
    在令人目眩的闪光灯强光辉映下，海峡两岸体育交流揭开了新的一页。
    ４月１７日下午４时许，由２７人组成的中国台北青年体操队出现在首都机场卫星厅。早已守候在那里等着记录这一历史时刻的百余名中外记者无形中组成了盛大的欢迎场面。他们蜂拥而上，举着话筒、录音机的胳膊犹如平地冒出的密林。中国台北奥委会官员、詹德基团长兴奋地说：“真没想到，欢迎场面如此盛大。”庄秀石领队则回身揽过后边的一位小队员，开玩笑道：“他们初次经历这种大场面，都不知所措了。”正在机场的中外游客们为这个场面所吸引，也纷纷掏出相机，加入记者行列。在热烈的气氛中，中国台北青年体操队的官员，逐一回答了记者们的发问。
    庄秀石坦率地说：当前，亚洲体操水平发展很快，相比之下，我们水平不高，但这次亚洲青年锦标赛上，我们有信心在个别项目上进入前列。接着，他证实了一位台湾记者的说法，“鉴于这种情况，我们打算邀请高水平的大陆体操教练赴台北执教，以尽快提高我们的运动水准。”他说，“对此，他同样充满信心，相信两岸的奥委会会就此达成协议。因为这次能够成行北京本身就是最好的例子。只要坐下来谈，没有什么障碍不能消除的。”
    詹德基团长还详细地介绍了该队在京的具体安排，他说，“我们将全力以赴参加比赛，但在赛后，打算让小队员们游览长城、十三陵、故宫，此外，还希望能观摩即将举行的中国杯国际体操赛。”
