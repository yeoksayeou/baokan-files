The phrase "Workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and businesspeople, all come together to do business, everyone digs into the central treasury" is a popular saying circulating in society today. Whether it is right or wrong, let's not discuss that for now. "Everyone digging into the central treasury" refers to digging into the central fiscal budget, into the central treasury. The "everyone" here is not literally everyone, but only a part of the population. However, this part of the population has significant influence and causes severe harm, and should not be taken lightly. Let's look at a few examples:

First, there is the practice of setting up private slush funds, placing income that originally belonged to the state under personal control, and evading state financial supervision. Recently, safes were in short supply in the market, which is related to this issue. The central government has repeatedly banned the issuance of bonuses and gifts, and has repeatedly tried to control consumption funds, especially to reduce the purchasing power of social groups. However, the practice of setting up private slush funds continues unabated, and various forms of "bonuses" that evade bank cash management still flow into people's pockets, with large amounts of goods being distributed to various households.

Second, there is the trend of turning labor protection items into fashion, work meals into banquets, and receiving guests into using cars. Publicly funded fashion wear, banquets everywhere, in some places this has become a norm, and some people can even live off these banquets without needing to cook at home. These expenses, some are included in production costs, some are listed as non-operating expenses, some squeeze welfare funds into production development funds, and when production funds are insufficient, they are squeezed into costs. In the end, the central fiscal budget has to foot the bill.

Third, there is tax evasion. It is said that individual economies evade taxes by 70%-80%, and state-owned, collective, and township enterprises also have significant tax evasion, all of which clearly dig into the central fiscal budget.

To address the behavior of digging into the central fiscal budget, it is necessary to legislate and enforce the law strictly, and to punish offenders resolutely. This is an indispensable part of establishing a socialist market economy. Economic measures must be supplemented with necessary administrative and legal measures to establish a new economic order.

### 对“大家挖中央”不可小视

　　对“大家挖中央”不可小视
    “工农兵学商，一起来经商，大家挖中央”。这是当今社会上流传的一句顺口溜。是非曲直，姑且不论。“大家挖中央”，指的是挖中央财政，挖中央金库。这里的“大家”其实决非人人有份，只是部分人而已。不过这部分人能量很大，危害极深，切不可等闲视之。试举数例说明：
    一是私设小金库，把原属国家的收入置于自己的权力支配之下，逃避国家的财务监督。前些时，市场上保险柜一度脱销，即与此有关。中央三令五申严禁滥发奖金实物，一再要控制消费基金，特别是压缩社会集团购买力，然而，私设小金库仍层出不穷，避开银行现金管理的名目繁多的“奖金”仍不断流向各人腰包，大量实物发到各家各户。
    二是劳保用品时装化、工作用餐宴会化、迎送客人轿车化。公费穿时装，宴会到处摆，有的地方已形成风气，甚至有人可以靠吃宴请过日子，自己不必回家开伙。这笔开销，有的进入成本，有的列入营业外支出，有的把福利基金挤入生产发展基金，生产基金不够用再挤入成本，最后还得中央财政付账。
    三是偷税漏税。据说，个体经济偷税漏税达７０％—８０％，国营、集体、乡镇企业等也相当严重，都是明显地挖中央财政。
    对挖中央财政行为，必须严肃立法、执法，坚决惩处，这是建立社会主义商品经济不可缺少的内容。经济手段不辅以必要的行政手段和法律手段，经济新秩序是建立不起来的。
