Arafat Proposes Conditions for Elections in Occupied Territories: Israeli Withdrawal and UN Supervision

	New Delhi, April 16 (Xinhua) — Palestinian President and PLO Executive Committee Chairman Yasser Arafat said today at a ceremony marking the first anniversary of the assassination of PLO military leader Abu Jihad that the withdrawal of Israeli troops and UN supervision are the two prerequisites for the PLO to accept elections in the occupied territories.

	Arafat said he is also willing to accept a transitional period of several months before the final settlement.

	Israeli Prime Minister Shamir proposed an election plan in the occupied territories during his recent visit to the United States, promising to allow Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to choose representatives to negotiate with Israel and to undergo a 5-year self-rule period before the final settlement. The United States considers this proposal encouraging.

	Arafat said Palestinians want to hold elections, but do not want to do so under the shadow of the occupying army. Palestinians accept a transitional period under UN supervision, but not under Israeli occupation.

	Arafat said, "Let me tell U.S. President Bush, treat us the same way you treat Namibia."

　　阿拉法特提出在被占领土选举条件
　　以色列撤军　联合国监督
    新华社突尼斯４月１６日电　巴勒斯坦国总统和巴解组织执委会主席阿拉法特今天在此间举行的纪念巴解组织军事领导人阿布·杰哈德被暗杀一周年仪式上说，以色列撤军和联合国的监督是巴解组织接受在被占领土举行选举的两个先决条件。
    阿拉法特说，他还愿意接受在最后解决前实行几个月过渡时期的建议。
    以色列总理沙米尔在本月初访美期间提出在被占领土的选举计划答应允许约旦河西岸和加沙地带的巴勒斯坦人选择代表同以色列进行谈判，并在最后解决问题之前经历５年自治期。美国认为这一建议是令人鼓舞的。
    阿拉法特说，巴勒斯坦人希望进行选举，但是不愿在占领军的阴影下进行选举。巴勒斯坦人接受在联合国监督下的过渡时期，但不愿接受以色列占领下的过渡时期。
    阿拉法特说：“让我对美国总统布什说，对待我们能像对待纳米比亚一样就行了。”
