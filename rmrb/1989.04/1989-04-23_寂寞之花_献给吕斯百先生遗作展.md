The art galleries of recent years have been dazzling with a variety of exhibitions, each different from the next. Not only are the works of the exhibiting artists displayed, but also countless inscriptions from famous people. I once encountered an exhibition where each inscription was pinned with one or two nails under the artwork, fluttering and askew, filling two walls with large and small sheets of paper. Naturally, there were also flower baskets and, at the opening ceremony, various luxury cars lined up on the square, supposedly indicating the success of the investment by the sponsoring or supporting units. It was indeed very lively.

Mr. Lü Siba's posthumous works exhibition, however, does not belong to any of the above categories. In his early years, he studied painting in France with predecessors like Chang Shuhong and Wu Zuoren, and won numerous awards. He is one of the founders of Chinese oil painting, but this is the first time he has held a personal exhibition in Beijing. The famous Lyon painter Chavanne and Professor Laurens of the Paris Academy of Fine Arts were his revered teachers, but after returning to China, his oil paintings over the decades were purely Chinese in emotion and subject matter. Most of his life was dedicated to art education, but it cannot be said that his disciples are everywhere, because from the early days of liberation, he went alone to the northwest, where he opened up the artistic garden of the Northwest Normal University in the desert, and returned to Nanjing Normal University's Art Department only after seven years away from home.

In 1934, he had just returned from Paris, and Mr. Xu Beihong invited him to teach at the Central University Art Department in Nanjing. I happened to be a student there for a year, although I was enrolled in Pan Yuliang's class, Mr. Lü can still be considered my teacher. Later, in Chongqing and in Nanjing after the war of resistance, we became teacher and friend, often visiting each other. He once painted a very good oil portrait of me, but because the black cheongsam in the painting had embroidered flowers, it was destroyed during the looting of the Cultural Revolution. I regret not having preserved it, and of course, I never imagined that in the Cultural Revolution of 1973, he would die unjustly.

The Mr. Lü Siba I knew was such a humble, elegant, and sincere artist. I read in the commemorative publications of Nanjing Normal University and Northwest Normal University that he died unjustly. This is a phrase commonly used for many who died in the Cultural Revolution, but how they were unjustly treated varies. I think the greatest injustice Mr. Lü suffered was being unable to paint in the unprecedented terror. Even during the Anti-Japanese War, when the enemy was at the gates, he could maintain a strong creative passion. In that period, when only a large number of propaganda posters, cartoons, and woodcuts were produced, and few oil paintings were created, he still left behind masterpieces like "Courtyard" (see the lower left image). However, the Cultural Revolution deprived such a peaceful and harmless painter of his creative life.

He left us a considerable number of works from that era and a period after liberation, like pastoral poems, simple and natural, like his personality. In his works, there is no excessive sweetness, no deliberately exaggerated passion, just the ordinary land and life of China, in Shaanbei, in Jiangnan, by the sea. This exhibition also includes that still life "Eel" that I particularly like and remember deeply, which is two pure black eels still jumping in a dish on a silver-gray background. Although it is a genuine use of skilled oil painting techniques, the simple and unconstrained charm has captured the essence of Chinese painting.

We should mention the serious spirit of dedication he put into teaching. I read an article written by a young teacher from Northwest Normal University, Lu Jianmin, commemorating him, in which he mentioned a small incident: once, Lu Jianmin was scheduled to teach a life drawing class using the Laocoön plaster statue, but in that remote area, it was impossible to find a complete image of the "Laocoön and His Two Sons" sculpture and related materials. The night before the class, around 9 o'clock, Lu went to ask Mr. Lü for advice, but after turning over the bookshelves and pulling out a wooden box from under the bed, Mr. Lü could not find the materials he had brought back from France. It was late at night, and Lu asked Mr. Lü if he should change the topic for the next day's class. Mr. Lü said that the teaching plan must be strictly followed, so he dictated the author, era, and background of the sculpture, and so on, until late at night, giving Lu the confidence to prepare for the next day's lecture. However, the next morning, as Lu was about to start the lecture, he saw Mr. Lü running towards him with a stack of materials from outside the window, silently handing them over and then turning back and leaving. Lu opened them to find single-page full images and detailed images of various kinds, as well as Mr. Lü's handwritten more detailed and complete introductions and outlines of points students should pay attention to. Lu could not help but be moved as he lectured to the students, realizing that Mr. Lü might have stayed up all night for this, and could not speak without choking up. The entire class of students was also moved.

They say: art is the path of solitude, but perhaps this is only true for a part of the truly great artists.

### 寂寞之花——献给吕斯百先生遗作展

　　寂寞之花    
    ——献给吕斯百先生遗作展
    郁风
    美术馆里近年来使人眼花缭乱的交替着各种迥然不同的展览，而且不仅展览作者本人的作品，也展览大批名人题字，我碰到有一次竟是每幅题字用一两个图钉钉在展品下面飘飘荡荡歪歪斜斜挤满两面墙的大小单宣纸上。自然也展览鲜花篮和在开幕式时广场上排满的各种名牌豪华汽车，据说主办或资助单位就要看汽车的多少证明投资的成功程度。真是十分热闹。
    吕斯百先生的遗作展却不属于上列的任何一类。他早年是和常书鸿、吴作人等前辈同时在法国学画的，也曾多次获奖，是中国油画的奠基者之一，但在北京举行个人展览是第一次。著名的里昂画家夏凡纳和巴黎美术学院的劳朗斯教授是他崇拜的老师，但是他回国以后数十年来的油画作品却是纯粹以中国人的感情画的中国。他一生中大半精力是贡献给美术教育，但却不能说桃李遍天下，因为从解放之初就只身奔赴西北，在沙漠中开拓出西北师范学院的艺术园地，离家７年才回到南京师大美术系任教。
    １９３４年他刚从巴黎回国，徐悲鸿先生聘请他在南京中大艺术系任教，我正好也在那里就读一年，虽然是选在潘玉良先生教室上课，吕先生也应算我的老师。后来在重庆和抗战结束后的南京又成为师友，经常过往。他曾为我画过一幅极好的油画像，就因为画中当时穿的黑旗袍襟上绣了花，在文革抄家中就不能不被毁掉。我为此痛悔没有保存好，当然更没想到就在“文革”中的１９７３年他含冤去世。
    我所认识的吕斯百先生是那么一位谦和、儒雅、诚挚的艺术家。我从南京师大和西北师院纪念他的校刊中读到“含冤去世”这个词，这是对许多在“文革”中丧生的人惯用的同样的词，但如何“含冤”却各有不同。我想吕先生所“含”的最大的“冤”就是处在史无前例的恐怖中再也不能作画。即使处在敌人压境的抗日战争中，他还能够保持旺盛的创作热情，在那只能产生大量宣传画、漫画、木刻，很少有油画的时期中，他还留下像《庭院》（见左下图）那样的杰作，可是“文革”却剥夺了这样一位与世无争与人无争的画家的创作生命。
    他为我们留下了相当大量的那个时代和解放后一段时期的田园诗一般的作品，像他的为人一样朴实、自然。在他的作品中没有过分的甜美，没有故意夸张的激情，只是平凡的中国的土地和生活，在陕北，在江南，在海边。这次展出也包括那幅我非常喜爱、印象很深的静物《鲇鱼》，那是两条纯黑色的放在盘中还会跳跃的鱼，在银灰调子的背景上。虽然是地道的运用纯熟的油画技巧，那种简洁、洒脱的情趣却得到中国画的精髓。
    应该提一下他在教学方面所付出的认真的精神劳动。我读到一位当年西北师院青年教师陆剑岷所写纪念他的文章，其中提到一件小事：有一次陆剑岷按计划用拉奥孔石膏像上素描课，但在那偏远地区无法找到《拉奥孔及其二子》雕像全图和有关资料，上课的前一晚９点多钟陆去请教吕先生，当时翻遍书架和床底下拉出的木箱都没有找到吕先生从法国带回的资料。夜深了，陆向吕先生请示是否明早上课吕先生改题，吕先生说教学计划必须严格执行，于是便口述这件雕像的作者、年代和背景等等，直讲到深夜，使陆满怀信心地准备明早上讲台。不料次晨陆刚开始要讲课，只见窗外吕先生抱着一叠资料向陆跑来，从窗口默默地递过来然后回头就走了。陆打开来看，有单页的全图和细部多种图片，还有他手写的更详尽完整的介绍和学生应注意之点等文字提纲。陆向学生讲述时不能不意识到吕先生可能为此通宵未眠，不禁哽咽不能成声，全体学生也为之感动。
    人说：艺术是寂寞之道，只有对于一部分真正的艺术家是如此吧。
