The Opium War marked the beginning of China's entry into the modern world. From the Self-Strengthening Movement to today's reforms, the Chinese nation's pursuit of modernization has been consistent, viewing industrialization as an unmitigated boon. Today, this seems to have become a national consensus. Authoritarians and democrats often debate, but they are united in pursuing the goal of high modernization, or "excessive industrialization."

A book edited by Japanese scholar Yamamoto Shin, "Chinese Civilization and the World: Toynbee's View of China" (translated by Zhou Songlun et al., published by Dongfang Press in 1988), presents a different perspective. It points out that the fundamental flaws of industrial civilization in destroying ecological balance and polluting the environment have been exposed. Whether this global crisis can be solved by industrial civilization through technological means is increasingly doubtful. Both developed and developing countries, in their pursuit of "excessive industrialization," have caused irreparable damage to resources and the environment, leading to the rise of the Green Peace movement. People have realized that the price of excessive industrialization is eroding the very foundation of human survival. Based on this, Toynbee made a prediction: "Advanced industrial nations will enter a phase of de-industrialization because they will be the first to bear the pressure."

It is undeniable that China's steps into industrial civilization have been faltering, placing China's per capita national income among the lowest in the world. However, is this delay entirely detrimental? Toynbee believes that on the flip side of delayed development, there is an advantage in avoiding excessive industrialization. Just as the world is about to enter the de-industrialization era, this presents China with a "unique opportunity." Of course, such prophetic views are hard for contemporary Chinese, eager to join the modernization race, to accept. But it does raise a question worth pondering.

Chinese civilization originated in its homeland. Since the pre-Wei and Jin periods, when "native Chinese culture" absorbed Buddhism to form the "traditional Chinese culture" of the Wei and Jin periods, China has carried two historical burdens. Clearly, China's entry into the third phase, influenced by Western Christian culture, or "modern Chinese culture," has been even slower than its entry into the second phase, influenced by Buddhism, or "traditional Chinese culture." But does this prove China's lack of ambition? No. In his book "China" (published in 1922), American scholar Edwin O. Reischauer wrote that although Japan's modernization movement was vigorous, compared to China's spiritual revolution, its foundation was shallow and superficial. Decades of history have shown that while China's performance in "modernization" has been disappointing, its chapters in cultural revolution have been surprisingly rich, even surpassing the Russian Revolution. It was Reischauer who first proposed that China should take a self-reliant path independent of foreign influence. This prophet asserted that if China could achieve political and especially cultural spiritual independence, it would mean the formation of a new civilization distinct from modern Western material civilization. "China will, in the shortest moment, present to all humanity its new hope, and China will occupy the first rank." Whether this viewpoint had an influence on China's fate decades later, I cannot say, but undoubtedly, the logic of the two is not without similarity.

Toynbee pointed out a dilemma and a way out: In China, the advancement of modernization and the effort to defend tradition have created a contradiction, and reconciling these two opposing goals is extremely difficult. He believed the way out lies in: self-control and moderation in full industrialization, that is, rejecting the rapid promotion of excessive industrialization. This is reflected in avoiding the exclusion of other social production methods by mechanization, thus forming a lifestyle that is neither the "explosive" Western way nor the "fossilized" pre-industrial agricultural society, so as to "walk a third path" on the basis of integrating the "fluidity" of Western civilization with the "stability" of Chinese civilization. This is probably what Reischauer referred to as a new civilization of spiritual independence! It is under this analysis that Toynbee in his later years proposed a shocking concept: "China is the core of the world government." He believed that the strong unity and homogeneity of Chinese civilization can provide a cohesive force for the world after de-industrialization. This cohesive force is not only Confucian, political, but also Taoist, religious. "Living in harmony with nature, listening to nature's arrangements, everything has a beginning and an end. This is a religion." The religious view of nature is necessary for humans. Of course, I think the power of thought lies precisely in the fact that it is a manifestation of national quality, not a floating light on ancient texts. The fundamental strength of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism also lies here: "The Chinese people are the most tenacious people in the world. When the people of other countries are considering things 10 years ahead, the Chinese are already considering things 100 years ahead. The Chinese people are essentially an indestructible people, a patient people...." If this is accurate, then when China enters modernization and developed countries deepen de-industrialization, what should our descendants do?

　　中国传统文化与未来世界    
    ——推荐《中国文明与世界》
    谢选骏
    鸦片战争一声炮响，轰开了大清国门，中国逐渐走进了现代世界。从洋务运动直到今天的改革，中国民族追求现代化的意愿一脉相承，更把工业化看作一种有利无弊的壮举。时至今日，这似乎已成了民族的共识。新权威主义者与民主主义者时有争议，但在追求高度现代化即“过量工业化”的目标上，则完全一致。
    日本学者山本新等编著的一本书《中国文明与世界——汤因比的中国观》（周颂伦等译，东方出版社１９８８年出版），却提出了另一番见解。原来，工业文明破坏生态平衡并污染环境的根本缺陷，已经暴露。而这一世界性的危机是否能由工业文明自身以技术方式来解决，也越来越成疑问。发达国家和不发达国家竞相追求的“过量工业化”，造成了难以代偿的资源和环境破坏，绿色和平运动因此风起云涌。人们发现，过量工业化的代价，正在瓦解人类赖以生存的基础。汤因比正基于此而作出了预言：“先进工业国将因首先承受不了这种压力而进入脱工业化的阶段。”
    毋庸讳言，中国进入工业文明的步履蹒跚，已使中国的人均国民收入名落世界一百二十几位，但是，中国的这种迟滞性是否有百弊而无一利呢？汤因比认为，在迟滞发展的反面，还得天独厚地享有着不可能走向过量工业化的优越性。就在世界即将进入脱工业化时代之际，这给了中国一种“特殊的机遇”。当然，这种先知式的高论是很难被急于挤进现代化竞争的当代中国人接受的。但它确实也提出了一个需要思索的问题。
    中国文明发轫于本土。自从魏晋以前的“中国本土文化”吸收了佛教而形成魏晋以后的“中国传统文化”，中国就背上了两层历史包袱。很明显，中国进入第三期即受西方基督教文化影响的“中国现代文化”的步履，比它进入第二期即接受佛教影响的“中国传统文化”还要迟缓。但这是否能证明中国的死不争气？不能。美国学者埃德温·赖肖尔在其《中国论》（１９2２年出版）中写道，尽管日本的现代化运动进行得轰轰烈烈，但和中国的精神革命的份量相比，其根基不免浅显、浮面。几十年来的历史表明，中国在“现代化”上的表现虽然不尽如人意，但在文化革命上书写的篇章却又惊人地丰富，其程度甚至远远超过了俄国革命。正是赖肖尔率先提出中国应该走一条不依赖外国的自力更生道路。这位先知断言，中国若能完成政治特别是文化精神上的独立，就意味着区别于近代西方物质文明的新文明可以形成，“中国将在最短的瞬间向全人类展现其全新的希望，中国就能占据第一级的地位。”这种论点是否对几十年后中国的命运产生了引导作用，我无法断言，但无疑两者的逻辑不乏相似。
    汤因比指出了一个困境和一条出路：在中国，推进现代化与努力守卫传统之间产生了矛盾，而调和这两种方向悖反的目标则极端困难。他认为出路在于：全面工业化的自我控制节度，即拒绝猛烈地推进过量工业化……体现在避免以机械化排斥其它社会生产手段，从而形成一种既非西方式“爆炸型”的生活方式，又非前工业化农业社会“化石型”的生活方式，以便在西方文明“流动性”与中国文明“稳定性”合二而一的基础上“走出第三条道路”。这大概就是赖肖尔所说的文化精神上独立的新文明吧！正是在这种分析下，晚年的汤因比提出了一个耸人听闻的概念：“中国是世界政府的核心”。他认为，中国文明强大的统一性和同质性可以为脱工业化以后的世界提供一种共同生存的凝聚力。这凝聚力不仅是儒学的、政治型的，也是老庄的、宗教式的。“顺从自然而生活，倾听自然的安排，万事都会有始有终。这是一种宗教。”宗教的自然观，对人来说是必要的。当然，我想思想的力量恰恰因为它是国民素质的体现，而非游离于典籍上的浮尘之光。儒释道的根本力量也在于此：“中国国民是世界上最具坚韧力的国民，当其他国家的国民考虑１０年以后的事时，中国人已在考虑１００年以后的事情了。中国国民本质上是不灭的国民，不急不躁的国民。……”（《中国论》）如果这是准确的，那么等中国步入现代化，发达国家深入脱工业化时，我们的子孙又该怎么办？
