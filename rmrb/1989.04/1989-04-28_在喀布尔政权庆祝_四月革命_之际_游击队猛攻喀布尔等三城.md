Islamabad, April 28 (Xinhua News Agency) - According to local newspapers and foreign news agencies, on the occasion of the 11th anniversary of the successful "April Revolution" of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, the seven-party alliance of guerrillas simultaneously launched heavy attacks on the cities of Kabul, Kandahar, and Jalalabad.

April 27 was the day commemorating the success of the "April Revolution" of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan. To avoid guerrilla attacks, the Kabul regime held a military parade a day earlier on April 26 to mark the celebration. On April 27, the seven-party alliance of guerrillas fired at least 58 rockets into Kabul, resulting in 16 deaths and 46 injuries, and causing severe damage to buildings within the city. This was the most intense attack on the capital since the Soviet troops completely withdrew from Afghanistan on February 15. The guerrillas also claimed that they would increase military pressure on Kabul.

In the Jalalabad battlefield, the guerrillas completely occupied the Chaprihar area, 13 kilometers south of Jalalabad. The battle lasted for two days. The guerrillas captured two major strongholds and 36 fortifications, killing or wounding 66 government soldiers, capturing 46, and seizing 5 tanks, more than 10 artillery pieces, and over 100 light weapons. This allowed the guerrillas to directly attack the government's 81st Brigade stationed 4 kilometers south of Jalalabad. In recent days, the Kabul government forces have fired at least 40 "Scud" missiles at the guerrilla positions around Jalalabad, but the hit rate was low, and the casualties were minimal.

In recent days, the guerrillas have tightened their encirclement of Kandahar and have planned to capture the Kandahar airport. According to the defense minister of the provisional government of the seven-party alliance, Nabi, the weapons, ammunition, and supplies needed for this attack have been delivered to the participating guerrillas. This offensive will be launched jointly by various guerrilla factions, a decision made at a recent meeting of guerrilla leaders held near Kandahar.

Additionally, Gulbuddin, the foreign minister of the provisional government of the seven-party alliance, said in a speech at a refugee gathering in Peshawar on April 27 that only through fighting can Afghanistan achieve peace. He stated that the Afghan people have been forced to resolve the Afghan issue through military means rather than negotiations. Under the current circumstances, peace talks are unlikely to bring independence and peace to Afghanistan.

### 在喀布尔政权庆祝“四月革命”之际  游击队猛攻喀布尔等三城

　　在喀布尔政权庆祝“四月革命”之际    
    游击队猛攻喀布尔等三城
    本报伊斯兰堡４月２８日电  记者任毓骏报道：据当地报纸及外电消息，在喀布尔政权庆祝人民民主党“四月革命”成功１１周年之际，七党联盟游击队同时对喀布尔、坎大哈和贾拉拉巴德等大城市发起猛烈攻击。
    ４月２７日是阿富汗人民民主党“四月革命”成功纪念日，为躲避游击队的袭击，喀布尔政权提前一天于２６日举行了阅兵式以示庆祝。２７日这一天，七党联盟游击队至少向喀布尔市发射了５８发火箭，造成１６人死亡，４６人受伤，市内建筑物遭严重破坏。这是自２月１５日苏军从阿富汗完全撤走后，首都喀布尔经受的最猛烈的攻击。游击队方面还声称要对喀布尔“加大军事压力”。
    在贾拉拉巴德战场，游击队完全占领了贾城以南１３公里处的查普里哈尔地区，这场战斗持续了两天。游击队攻下了该地区两个大据点和３６个工事，打死打伤６６名喀布尔政府军，俘获４６人，缴获５辆坦克，１０余门大炮，百余件轻武器。这样，游击队就可直接攻击驻守在贾城城南４公里处的政府军第８１旅。喀布尔政府军近日来连续向贾城周围的游击队阵地至少发射了４０枚“飞毛腿”式地对地导弹，但命中率不高，造成的伤亡不大。
    近日来，游击队缩小了对坎大哈的包围圈，并制订了攻占坎大哈机场的计划。据七党联盟临时政府国防部长纳比称，为发起这一进攻的武器、弹药和物资已运交参战的游击队，这次进攻将由各派游击队联合发起，这一决定是日前在坎大哈附近召开的一次游击队领导人联合会议上作出的。
    另据报道，七党联盟临时政府外交部长古勒布丁于２７日在白沙瓦举行的一次难民集会上发表演讲说，只有战斗才能给阿富汗带来和平。他说，阿富汗人被迫以军事手段而不是谈判来解决阿富汗问题。在目前情况下，和平谈判不可能给阿富汗带来独立与和平。
