Four criminals, including Guo Hai, who stole and sabotaged rural power equipment, were recently executed in Tianjin.

Guo Hai and Yao Guangxing, farmers from Shigezhuang Township in Baodi County, Tianjin, along with Gao Wannian and Feng Guohui (who have already been sentenced to life imprisonment and a fixed-term imprisonment respectively), committed 17 crimes in four townships and 14 villages in Baodi County, Tianjin, and Xianhe County, Hebei Province, from May 1987 to October 1988. They dismantled four operational transformers, stole 27,000 meters of low-voltage power lines, and 1,200 meters of high-voltage power lines that had not yet been put into use, causing direct economic losses of over 62,000 yuan and gaining illicit proceeds of over 6,500 yuan.

Wang Dewu and Sun Runpu, farmers from Taitou Township in Jinghai County, Tianjin, committed nine crimes in five townships and 10 villages in this county from August to December last year. They dismantled operational transformers and voltage reducers, causing direct economic losses of over 53,000 yuan and gaining illicit proceeds of 4,100 yuan.
