	The People's Daily reports: Correspondent Xú Rújùn reports: On the afternoon of April 19, some senior comrades from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's Organization Department held a symposium to commemorate Hu Yaobang's everlasting contributions through their personal experiences and feelings.

	In 1978, Hu Yaobang took up the position of the head of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's Organization Department. On the second day of his arrival, he went to the Letters and Visits Office to understand the situation of letters and visits from the masses and held a symposium with everyone. At that time, he proposed that no matter when the case occurred or who made the decision, if it was a wrongful, false, or erroneous case, it must be rectified. Later, he presided over a symposium on letters and visits work by some provincial and municipal organization departments, proposing many suggestions to emphasize the importance of letters and visits work. The former director of the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's Organization Department, Yang Fatao, said that Hu Yaobang served as the head for one year and personally handled more than 4,000 letters from the masses. These letters included those written by wronged old cadres and those written by village production team leaders. Hu Yaobang not only carefully instructed and handled each one but also personally replied to some.

	Several senior comrades recalled the situation shortly after the Gang of Four was smashed. They said that rectifying the wrongs, redressing wrongful, false, and erroneous cases, and implementing the party's cadre policy faced pressures from above and obstacles from below, making it difficult. Hu Yaobang was resourceful and decisive, truly making the organization department a "home for party members" and a "home for cadres," showing extraordinary courage and bravery. The issue of rectifying the "Sixty-One Case" had significant differences at that time. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's Organization Department required the provision of archives but encountered obstacles. Hu Yaobang decided that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's Organization Department should handle the materials themselves, seeking justice for a group of old cadres. For example, Hu Yaobang learned that some old cadres had been visiting Beijing in succession for the "Anti-Enemy Troupe Case." He immediately instructed the drafting of documents to correct this wrong case. After the notice from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's Organization Department was issued, it solved the problem of 8,000 people at once. The member of the Central Advisory Commission and the former head of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's Organization Department, Chen Yeping, said that Hu Yaobang was upright and open, forever our role model.

	The member of the Central Advisory Commission and the former deputy head of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's Organization Department, Zeng Zhi, said that Hu Yaobang made a significant contribution to formulating the correct line, principles, and policies for the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which is unforgettable. She suggested compiling Hu Yaobang's work in the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's Organization Department as educational materials for future generations. Several senior comrades mentioned that Hu Yaobang ate with everyone in line, paid attention to uniting comrades, and was approachable. He was full of energy, working for the party's cause early in the morning, in the afternoon, and in the evening. He often invited cadres to his home to discuss work on Sundays. The materials sent to him for review were never delayed, and he would quickly provide clear opinions. They said, "Hu Yaobang left us too early. We will commemorate our old head, Hu Yaobang, with our actual actions!"

　　出任组织部长一年　处理群众来信四千    
    中组部座谈胡耀邦不朽功绩   
    赞扬他在平反冤假错案中表现的胆略和勇气
    本报讯  记者徐如俊报道：４月１９日下午，中共中央组织部部分老同志举行座谈会，用自己的亲身经历和感受缅怀胡耀邦同志。
    １９７８年，胡耀邦同志担任中共中央组织部部长。他到中组部的第二天，就来到信访处了解群众来信来访情况，同大家一起座谈。当时，他就提出，不管是什么时候的案子，不管是什么人定的，只要是冤假错案就要平反。之后，他又主持召开了部分省市组织部门信访工作座谈会，提出重视信访工作的许多建议。中组部办公厅原主任杨法陶说，耀邦同志担任部长一年，亲自处理群众来信４０００余件。这些来信，有蒙冤的老干部写的，也有农村生产队长写的，耀邦同志不仅逐一认真批示处理，有的还亲自回信答复。
    几位老同志回顾刚粉碎“四人帮”不久时的情况说，拨乱反正，平反冤假错案，落实党的干部政策，上面有压力，下面有阻力，困难重重。耀邦同志多谋善断，真正使组织部成为“党员之家”、“干部之家”，表现了非凡的胆略和勇气。“六十一人案”平反昭雪问题，当时分歧较大，中组部要求提供档案，遇到阻力，耀邦同志就决定由中组部自己搞材料，为一批老干部伸张了正义。再如，耀邦同志得知一些老干部为“抗敌剧团”案陆续到京上访后，当即责成起草文件，纠正这起错案。中组部的通知发出后，一下子解决了８０００人的问题。中顾委委员、中组部原部长陈野苹说，耀邦同志一身正气，光明磊落，永远是我们的榜样。
    中顾委委员、中组部原副部长曾志说，耀邦同志为党的十一届三中全会制定正确路线、方针和政策，做了大量的工作，作出了不可磨灭的贡献。她建议把耀邦同志在中组部工作的情况整理出来，作为教育后人的史料。还有几位老同志谈到耀邦同志吃饭同大家一起排队，注意团结同志，平易近人；他精力充沛，大清早、上午、下午和晚上，都在为党的事业操劳；星期天还经常把干部叫到家里商量工作；送他批阅的材料，从来不积压，很快就会得到明确的意见。他们说，耀邦同志走得太早了，我们要用实际行动缅怀老部长胡耀邦同志！
