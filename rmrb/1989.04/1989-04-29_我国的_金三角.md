The regions where three provinces (or autonomous regions) meet, rich in gold resources, are known as the "Golden Triangle." China has three such "Golden Triangles."

The Henan-Shanxi-Shaanxi "Golden Triangle" is located at the junction of Henan, Shaanxi, and Shanxi provinces. After the discovery of gold reserves in the 1950s, this area gradually became one of the main gold mining bases in China. Currently, there are several national key gold mines such as Wenya and Qinling, as well as more than 20 county-level and township-level gold mines in this region. The gold production in this area is quite significant.

The Shaanxi-Gansu-Sichuan "Golden Triangle" is located at the junction of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Sichuan provinces. It consists of nine counties: Lueyang, Mianxian, and Ningqiang from Shaanxi; Wenxian, Kangxian, and Chengxian from Gansu; and Pingwu, Qingchuan, and Guangyuan from Sichuan. The gold management departments of the three provinces are actively planning to build more than 10 gold mines. It is estimated that by 1990, the gold production in this region will account for about 38% of the total production of the three provinces.

The Guizhou-Guangxi-Yunnan "Golden Triangle" is located at the junction of Guizhou, Guangxi, and Yunnan provinces (autonomous regions). This region covers an area of about 50,000 to 60,000 square kilometers, characterized by a carbonate platform, which has the geological conditions for gold formation. Some gold deposits have been discovered in the southwestern part of Guizhou and the northwestern part of Guangxi, and part of the reserves have been identified. Based on the geological data available, it is believed that there is a broad prospect for the development of gold production in this area.

　　我国的“金三角”
    黄金资源丰富的三省（区）交界地带被人们称之为“金三角”。我国共有三个这样的“金三角”。
    豫陕晋“金三角”——位于河南、陕西和山西三省交界地带。在５０年代探明黄金储量后，逐步成了我国黄金矿产主要基地之一。目前该地区有文峪、秦岭等国家重点金矿和２０多个县办、乡镇办的金矿。该地区的金产量相当可观。
    陕甘川“金三角”——位于陕西、甘肃和四川省交界地带。由陕西省的略阳、勉县、宁强，甘肃省的文县、康县、成县，以及四川省的平武、青川、广元等９县所组成。目前陕甘川三省黄金主管部门正积极部署，计划建设１０多个金矿。预计到１９９０年，该地区的黄金产量将占三省总产量的３８％左右。
    黔桂滇“金三角”——位于贵州、广西和云南三省（区）交界地带。该地区方圆五六万平方公里，为碳酸盐台地，具备黄金生成的地质条件。该地区已在贵州省西南部和广西西北部分别发现了一些黄金矿床，并探明了部分储量。根据已掌握的地质资料分析，认为这里有着广阔的发展黄金生产的前景。
