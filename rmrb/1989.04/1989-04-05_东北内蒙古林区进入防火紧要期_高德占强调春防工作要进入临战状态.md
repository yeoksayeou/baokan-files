Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, April 4th - (Reporter Lin Wentang) As the Northeast and Inner Mongolia forest areas are about to enter the critical period for spring forest fire prevention, from March 29 to April 2, the deputy commander of the State Forest Fire Prevention Headquarters and Minister of the Forestry Department, Gao Dezhan, presided over a spring forest fire prevention on-site office meeting in the Da Xing'anling Forestry Bureau of Inner Mongolia.

Gao Dezhan emphasized that the spring forest fire prevention in the Northeast and Inner Mongolia forest areas is of great significance and has a significant impact on the overall situation. It is a key area for national forest fire prevention. Last winter saw little snowfall, this spring has seen a rapid warming, early snowmelt, higher temperatures, and a dry climate. Forecasts indicate that there will be many days with strong winds, making the spring fire prevention situation still very severe. We must maintain a clear understanding of this and never be complacent. The fires in Liaoning's Jinzhou and Inner Mongolia's Xing'an League in March have already sounded the alarm for us.

Gao Dezhan proposed that the Northeast and Inner Mongolia forest areas must immediately mobilize for emergency action. Spring fire prevention work must immediately enter a state of full-scale combat readiness, taking decisive measures to eliminate all potential hazards. From now on, all levels of forestry authorities must immediately take up their posts and concentrate their efforts on leading the spring fire prevention work.

Given the heavy tasks of this year's spring fire prevention, the on-site office meeting also addressed and resolved several major issues affecting spring fire prevention.

　　东北内蒙古林区进入防火紧要期
    高德占强调春防工作要进入临战状态
    据新华社呼和浩特４月４日电  （记者林文堂）在东北、内蒙古林区即将进入春季防火工作紧要期的关键时刻，３月２９日至４月２日，国家森林防火总指挥部副总指挥、林业部部长高德占，在内蒙古大兴安岭林管局主持召开了东北、内蒙古林区春季森林防火现场办公会议。
    高德占强调指出，东北、内蒙古林区春季森林防火事关重大，影响全局，是全国森林防火的重点。去冬降雪少，今春回暖快，融雪早，气温偏高，气候干旱，预报大风天多，春防形势仍然十分严峻，对这一点必须保持清醒头脑，绝不可掉以轻心。今年３月辽宁锦州和内蒙古兴安盟的火灾，已经给我们敲起了警钟。
    高德占提出：东北、内蒙古林区必须立即紧急动员起来，春防工作要立即全面进入临战状态，采取果断措施坚决清除各种隐患。从现在起，全林区各级主要负责人必须立即上岗到位，集中力量领导春防工作。
    针对今年春防任务重，现场办公会还研究解决了一些影响春防的重大问题。
