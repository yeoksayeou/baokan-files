Today's fifth edition introduces the anti-corruption experience of Xiaocheng County in Hebei Province. The experience emphasizes transparency, which leads to fairness.

According to a report from our newspaper, in the past, Xiaocheng County had serious issues with unfair practices in land allocation for house building, mandatory procurement and levies, and family planning. In May of last year, the county implemented a system of "publicizing procedures, publicizing results, and strengthening public supervision." This has constrained power and allowed the public to see fairness. Today's fifth edition carries an article introducing this experience.
