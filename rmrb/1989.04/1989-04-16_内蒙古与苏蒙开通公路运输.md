    The People's Daily, Hohhot, April 15 — Reporter Ào Tēng learned from today's Inner Mongolia Transportation Work Conference that road transport has been opened between China's Inner Mongolia border regions and neighboring areas of the Soviet Union and Mongolia.

    Currently, Inner Mongolia has 10 road ports open or soon to be open with the Soviet Union and Mongolia, with 4 ports for the Soviet Union and 6 for Mongolia. By the end of March this year, the cargo volume had reached over 11,000 tons. This year, after the construction of the floating dock facilities on the Ergun River, the transport capacity will be significantly improved, with an estimated capacity of over 100,000 tons.
