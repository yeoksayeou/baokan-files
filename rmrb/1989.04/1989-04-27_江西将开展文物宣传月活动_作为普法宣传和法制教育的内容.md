Jiangxi to Launch Cultural Relics Protection Promotion Month

As part of legal publicity and legal education content

Our reporter in Nanchang reports: Recently, the Jiangxi Provincial Government decided to launch a cultural relics protection promotion month across the province in May. It is required that all localities treat this activity as an important part of legal publicity and legal education. The departments of culture, news, publishing, radio, and television will work together to promote the new trend of "Protecting cultural relics, everyone is responsible" throughout society.

The Provincial Cultural Bureau held a meeting with leaders from local and municipal cultural relics departments and provincial cultural relics units to discuss and deploy the work. Currently, relevant departments are actively preparing. The Provincial Cultural Bureau is organizing the filming of a three-episode television drama reflecting the crackdown on the theft and smuggling of cultural relics, which is about to start shooting; the Provincial Radio Station has rushed to produce a special program titled "Protecting cultural relics, everyone is responsible"; the China Cultural Relics Newspaper and Jiangxi Cultural Newspaper will open special pages for the promotion month; various museums are also preparing related exhibitions. At that time, the provincial, municipal, and county levels will hold opening ceremonies for the promotion month, set up promotion points in urban squares, parks, streets, and rural market towns, and organize various forms of promotional activities to make cultural relics protection work more deeply rooted in people's hearts and further enhance the nation's awareness of cultural relics.
