    Bush Summarizes Achievements After Three Months in Office, Declares a Good Start

    Our reporter, Cang Lide, reports from Washington, April 24: U.S. President Bush today in Chicago comprehensively summarized the achievements of his administration over the past three months, stating that he has made a "good start" in handling issues that require urgent attention and decisive action.

    Bush delivered this speech at a luncheon held by the American Newspaper Publishers Association. Bush first expressed that the White House and Congress have established a cooperative relationship based on bipartisan politics. A "key example" is that both sides reached a federal budget agreement before the deadline set by the Gramm-Rudman Act, taking a "strong first step" in addressing the deficit problem. He said, "The focus is on cooperation rather than confrontation."

    Bush said that since taking office, the United States has stabilized the savings and loan institutions that were in a state of crisis; strengthened government reforms in moral conduct; and launched anti-drug campaigns in various aspects. On long-term goals, Bush discussed education and environmental protection issues. He emphasized that in the technological age, the future of the United States depends on the quality and ability of every worker. Therefore, "first and foremost is to improve education."

    When discussing international issues, Bush said that the United States has adopted an international strategy aimed at solving the debt problems of the Third World. He urged creditor countries to reach debt reduction agreements with Mexico, Venezuela, and other debt-ridden countries.

    Bush stated that the work of a "comprehensive, thorough, and systematic reassessment of defense and foreign policy" will be completed in a few weeks, and the United States will also make decisions on arms control issues.

　　执政三月谈政绩  布什自称开端好
    本报华盛顿４月２４日电  记者仓立德报道：美国总统布什今天在芝加哥全面总结了他执政３个多月来的各项政绩，称他在掌握那些“需要紧急注意及决定性行动”的问题上取得了“良好开端”。
    布什是在美国报业出版商协会举行的午餐会上发表这篇讲话的。布什首先表示，白宫与国会在两党政治基础上建立了合作关系。一个“关键例证”是双方在格拉姆—拉德曼法案规定的期限之前达成了联邦财政预算协议，迈出了“对付赤字问题的强有力的头一步”。他说，“重点是合作而非对抗”。
    布什说，他上台后美国稳定了陷于危机状态的储贷机构；加强了政府道德操守方面的改革；在各个方面展开了反毒品运动。在长期目标上，布什谈到教育问题和环境保护问题。他强调指出，在技术时代，美国的未来取决于每个劳动力的素质和能力。因此，“首先和最重要的是改善教育”。
    在谈到国际问题时，布什说，美国采取了一项旨在解决第三世界债务问题的国际战略。他要求债权国与墨西哥、委内瑞拉及其他债务国达成减债协议。
    布什表示，对“全部、广泛、系统的防务、外交政策重估”的工作将在数星期后完成，同时美国还将对军备控制问题作出决定。
