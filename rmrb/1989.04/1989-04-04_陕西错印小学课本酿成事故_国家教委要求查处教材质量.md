Today, a relevant official from the State Council's State Education Commission spoke to the capital's news media, stating that Shaanxi Province's printing factory printed primary school language textbooks that included over 30 pages describing prostitutes (this newspaper's second page published this on April 3). This is an extremely rare major incident since the founding of the nation. The State Education Commission has already telegraphed Shaanxi Province's Education Commission to work with relevant departments to thoroughly investigate and handle this matter.

This official stated that recently, due to some textbook printing, publishing, and distribution units only focusing on making money, the quality of middle and primary school textbooks has declined, and even serious errors have occurred, causing negative impacts. He listed errors in primary school textbooks printed by Yunnan People's Publishing House and Tianjin Municipal Education Publishing House, and displayed numerous letters from parents and teachers.

This official also pointed out that some publishing houses and illegal publishing units, in order to seek excessive profits, disregard national regulations and criticisms from the education departments, indiscriminately compile and print various review materials for entrance exams. Some bookstores force the sale of such materials. Chongqing Publishing House, and some bookstores in Anhui Province and Shandong Province have all once forced the sale of other materials when selling textbooks. The Jinxiang Longfeng Art Factory in Changning County, Wenzhou City, even falsely claimed to be "commissioned by the State Education Commission" to solicit materials from various places. Such practices not only increase the economic burden on parents but also seriously disrupt normal teaching and increase the learning burden on students.

Regarding this, the official reminded local education departments and primary and secondary schools to stay vigilant and not be deceived. Once such phenomena are discovered, they should be reported to relevant departments and resisted.

　　陕西错印小学课本酿成事故
    国家教委要求查处教材质量
    本报北京４月３日讯  记者周庆报道：今天，国家教委有关负责人向首都新闻界发表谈话说，陕西省印刷厂印制的小学语文课本中，混入３０余页描写娼妓的篇章（本报二版于４月３日刊登），这是建国以来罕见的重大事故。国家教委已电告陕西省教委会同有关部门认真查处。
    这位负责人说，近来，由于一些教材印刷、出版、发行单位，只顾赚钱，致使中小学教材质量下降，甚至出现严重错误，造成不良影响。他列举了云南人民出版社、天津市教育出版社印制的小学课本中的错误，并展示了大量的家长、老师来信。
    这位负责人还指出，有些出版社和非法出版单位为牟取暴利，无视国家的有关规定和教育部门的批评，滥编滥印各种升学复习资料；有的书店硬性搭配销售此类材料。重庆出版社，安徽省、山东省有的书店都曾在出售课本时，硬性搭配其它资料。温州市苍南县金乡长丰工艺厂竟冒称“受国家教委委托”向各地征订有关材料。这类作法不仅增加了家长的经济负担，也严重干扰了正常的教学，加重了学生的学习负担。
    对此，这位负责人提醒各地教育部门和中小学校提高警惕，不要上当，一经发现这类现象，就要向有关部门揭发，进行抵制。
