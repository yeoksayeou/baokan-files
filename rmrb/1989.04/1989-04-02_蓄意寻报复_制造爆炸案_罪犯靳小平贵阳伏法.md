    Deliberately Seeking Revenge, Creating an Explosion Case
    Criminal Jin Xiaoping Executed in Guiyang

    Reporter Pan Di Du reports from Guiyang: Criminal Jin Xiaoping, who created a major and malicious explosion case, was sentenced to death and immediately executed by the Guiyang Intermediate People's Court on March 31.

    Jin Xiaoping, a worker from the Casting Steel Division of the Guiyang Building Materials Machinery Factory, was listed as an extra-staff member by the factory. He believed this was retaliation by the workshop director Luo. He then harbored the evil intention of seeking revenge and killing. On the morning of March 21, around 8:00 AM, Jin Xiaoping carried a bag containing explosives, detonators, and fuse cords into the workshop, intending to seek out Luo for revenge. Seeing that Luo was not there, he barged into the party and administrative office of the Casting Steel Division. He used a cigarette to ignite the fuse of the explosive package in the bag, instantly killing the director of the Casting Steel Division, Xu Nai Xian, and the deputy director, Wang Zhu Hua. Four other people, including deputy director Wang Jia Chun, were injured, causing a very bad impact.
