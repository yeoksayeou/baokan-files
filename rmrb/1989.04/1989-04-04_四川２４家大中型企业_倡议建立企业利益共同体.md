    Establishing an enterprise community of interests is becoming a goal pursued by entrepreneurs. Recently, 24 large and medium-sized enterprises in Sichuan issued a proposal, hoping to make this goal the direction for enterprises to deepen their reforms.

    The Panzhihua Iron and Steel Company, the Fifth Metallurgical Construction Company under the Ministry of Metallurgy, the Changhong Machinery Factory, and the Chengdu Daily Necessities Company are among the 24 enterprises that have achieved remarkable results in reform in Sichuan Province. The enthusiasm of these enterprises' managers and producers has been fully mobilized, leading to significant development in production. However, in recent years, there have been some gaps between the enterprise leaders and the workers. Many enterprise leaders believe that currently, mobilizing the enthusiasm of the workers through ideological and political work and material incentives is not enough; establishing an enterprise community of interests is also an effective way to mobilize the enthusiasm of enterprise managers and producers.

    Establishing an enterprise community of interests means, through various contracts, systems, and behavioral mechanisms, integrating the responsibilities, rights, and interests of enterprise managers and producers in political, economic, and cultural aspects, forming a new type of relationship where they rely on each other, cooperate closely, share risks, and share benefits, and jointly run the enterprise well. In recent years, some enterprises have experimented with forms such as shareholding and full-employee risk-mortgage contracting, which are beneficial explorations in establishing an enterprise community of interests.

　　四川２４家大中型企业
    倡议建立企业利益共同体
    据新华社成都４月３日电  （记者成建）建立企业利益共同体开始成为企业家的追求目标。四川２４家大中型企业最近发出倡议，希望把这个目标作为企业深化改革的方向。
    攀枝花钢铁公司、冶金部第五冶金建设公司、长虹机器厂、成都日杂公司等２４家企业都是四川省改革卓有成效的单位。这些企业的经营者与生产者的积极性得到发挥，生产得到较大发展。但近年来企业的领导者与职工间也出现了一些隔阂。许多企业负责人认为，现在调动职工的积极性，靠思想政治工作和物质鼓励还不够；建立企业利益共同体也是调动企业经营者与生产者积极性的有效途径。
    建立企业利益共同体，即通过各种契约、制度、行为机制等，把企业中经营者与生产者在政治、经济、文化等方面的责、权、利有机地结为一体，形成相互依靠、紧密合作、共担风险、利益共享的新型关系，共同办好企业。近几年来，一些企业试行的股份制、全员风险抵押承包等形式就是建立企业利益共同体的有益探索。
