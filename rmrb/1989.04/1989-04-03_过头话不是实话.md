Title: Over-the-top statements are not the truth

"Having friends come from afar, is it not a pleasure?" National People's Congress representatives and Political Consultative Conference members from all over the country gather in Beijing to discuss state affairs. The people and government of Beijing warmly welcome and receive them, which is completely reasonable.

Due to various reasons, the current atmosphere of civility and politeness is lacking. As the political, cultural, and international exchange center of the country, Beijing needs to treat the strengthening of spiritual civilization as a major task. The various levels of leadership and departments in Beijing are making efforts, usually taking it seriously, and during the NPC and CPPCC sessions in Beijing, they also take it seriously. Before the NPC and CPPCC sessions, the municipal leaders and relevant units did this, and local news organizations appropriately reported on it to promote service work, which is beyond reproach. Unfortunately, the article "Not an Unnecessary Truth" published in "Today's Talk" on March 25 criticized this, focusing on the point that "relevant officials" did "major publicity," "publicized it as big news," "made a mountain out of a molehill," and so on. The author claims to be telling "the truth," but these are precisely not the truth.

First, local newspapers publish a piece of news about real events happening in the city, with the entire article being just over 300 words, placed in the middle of the first page, in a three-column headline; local radio and television stations broadcasted it for less than a minute. These were called "major publicity," "publicized as big news," which goes against news common sense and is not the truth.

Second, preparing for the good service of the two sessions is not a "small matter." The so-called "making a mountain out of a molehill" goes against political common sense and is also not the truth. If there is no preparation, no inspection, no publicity, once a problem arises in the service, will the author "make a mountain out of a molehill"? Exactly how to do it well? It goes without saying.

Third, just like safety and hygiene, the issue of the representative's car convoy passing through is something that "relevant officials" are actually doing. Those who work hard cannot say a bit of the truth to publicize, but for the issue of the car convoy passing through, the author can use nearly half of the article to talk about the truth, which is contradictory. The so-called "truth," isn't it self-defeating?

The spiritual civilization construction of the capital needs the joint efforts of all parties, everyone to do real things, and tell the truth. In order to make "Today's Talk" not a single voice, I dare to say a bit of the truth, hoping to help "Today's Talk" do better.

　　过头话不是实话
　　丁炎
    “有朋自远方来，不亦乐乎？”全国人大代表、政协委员从祖国四面八方聚首京城，共议国是，北京市人民和政府热情欢迎接待，是完全合乎情理的。
    由于多方面原因，目前文明礼貌的风气欠佳。北京作为全国的政治、文化和国际交往中心，需要把加强精神文明建设作为一件大事。北京市各级领导和部门正在做出努力，平时认真抓，人大、政协在京开会，也要认真抓。在人大、政协开会之前，市领导和有关单位就是这样作的，地方新闻单位对此适当报道，以促进服务工作，无可非议。遗憾的是，３月２５日《今日谈》发表的《不算多余的实话》一文，却加以非难，集中到一点，就是说“有关官员”对此“大事宣传”、“办了还当作大新闻来宣传”、“小题大作”，等等。作者讲自己是说“实话”，恰恰这些都不是实话。
    一，地方报纸就本市办的实事发表一条消息，全文不过３００字多一点，登在一版中间，三栏题；地方电台、电视台播了不到一分钟。这些竟被说成是“大事宣传”、“当作大新闻来宣传”，这种说法违背了新闻常识，不算实话。
    二，为开好两会服务不是什么“小题”。所谓“小题大作”，违背了政治常识，也不算实话。如果不准备、不检查、不宣传，一旦服务上出了问题，作者会不会“大题大作”？究竟怎样做好？不言自喻。
    三，同安全、卫生等一样，代表车队通行问题也是“有关官员”实实在在干的。那些实干的不能说点实话宣传一下，而就车队通行问题，作者就可以用近一半篇幅去讲实话，前后矛盾。所谓“实话”，岂不是不攻自破？
    首都的精神文明建设需要各方共同努力，都来办实事，说实话。为了使《今日谈》不是一种声音，我不揣冒昧说点实话，希望有助于《今日谈》办得更好些。
