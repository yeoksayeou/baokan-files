The Concerns of the People and the Considerations of Officials
– Several People's Congress Representatives Discuss the Administrative Litigation Law Draft

Reporters: Xiao Du, Yuan Jian Da

Han Jinxiao, a farmer from the Salar ethnic group in Wulan County, Haixi Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, has no official position or title, but he is indeed a representative of the people's will. When talking about the Administrative Litigation Law draft that is currently under review, he is excited but also worried.

"To be honest, most farmers have low cultural literacy. Even with the law, they won't be able to use it to protect their legal rights immediately. Many farmers still believe that 'whether you are right or wrong, you can't sue the officials,'" he said. "Everyone is most afraid of being retaliated against if they sue and lose!"

Program Chunbo, the head of a township-run enterprise in Shunyi County, Beijing, and Li Fulu, the manager of the brick factory in Chuankou Town, Minhe Autonomous County, Qinghai Province, share similar sentiments. "Who is more powerful, the law or the officials? This question is always confusing. The law is good, but when it comes down to the local level, it can't compete with the local policies," they reflected. They pointed out that many local regulations and policies are still in conflict with the law. If this problem is not solved, in the future, when it goes to court, will the court uphold the law or side with those regulations and policies?

Guo Benli is from the Yuentan Sub-district Police Station in Beijing. He analyzed that if the Administrative Litigation Law is enacted, some emergency measures currently taken by the police may be deemed illegal and brought to court. For example, "custody and investigation" is not clearly defined in the law. However, if no measures are taken against suspicious individuals, the interests of the vast majority of citizens will be threatened. He suggested drafting a "custody and investigation" law to improve the legal mechanism.

"Citizens suing also needs to be legal," said Xie Changmin, the party secretary of Duliugou Village, Yongnian County, Hebei Province, expressing another concern. He believes that in the future, with the law, not all administrative penalties that are unfavorable to oneself should be considered "illegal," and it is even more inappropriate to file lawsuits indiscriminately. The law protects citizens' legal rights but also restrains citizens' behavior. Both officials and citizens must abide by the law.

In the discussion of the Administrative Litigation Law, we also heard some opinions from the "official" side. The talkative Jiangxi Provincial People's Congress representative and Mayor of Nanchang City, Cheng Andong, frankly said, "From the perspective of legal system construction, this is indeed a big deal. From the government's perspective, it is beneficial to get rid of the entanglement of letters and visits. In recent years, many things have been brought to the government. I am both the mayor and the judge." He believes that with the Administrative Litigation Law, not only can citizens' legal rights be protected, but the government can also legally exercise its powers, improve work efficiency, and enhance government prestige. He said that citizens suing officials is nothing to be afraid of. The benefit of suing is that it can improve officials' awareness of enforcing the law. If problems are handled illegally or unfairly, someone will sue, which is exactly using the legal restraint mechanism to improve officials' legal awareness. "But I am still worried about two problems," Cheng Andong told the reporter, "One is that the Administrative Litigation Law is a brand-new law, and the difficulty of implementation will inevitably be great. From the current strength and quality of the court's judges, it is not suitable. When the masses come to sue, will you accept it or not? Another problem is that the masses cannot yet correctly use this law. Some people may sue for a little dissatisfaction, and if they lose, they will lose confidence. Therefore, preparations must be made from top to bottom."

Ding Ruopeng, a representative of the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Congress and Mayor of Hegang City, did not hide his doubts about the Administrative Litigation Law. He said, "Currently, the entire legal system is not coordinated, and there will inevitably be many contradictions in implementation." He believes that the current conditions are not mature, and implementing the Administrative Litigation Law will bring great difficulties to government work. He said, "Now we need to focus on rectification and law enforcement. As long as corrupt officials are brought to justice, there is no need to let the people and the government be in opposition. He also worried that honest people who have been wronged would not dare to sue, while those who make unreasonable demands would keep suing. A representative from Shandong, a grassroots party branch secretary, worried, "There are thousands of lines from above, but only one needle from below. Money, grain, family planning, all these things are 'offending' the people. If the people can sue the officials, things will become complicated. Whether it is true or false, whether it is reasonable or not, it is hard to say at the moment, and the reputation will not be good." He called for the quick formulation of the Family Planning Law. From the situations reflected by various representative groups, there is a general demand for the formulation of supporting laws and regulations.

The three representatives from Fujian Province – Zhangzhou Mayor Han Yulin, Sanming Mayor Li Lishi, and Xiamen Mayor Zou Erjun – are all energetic "officials." They believe that the formulation of the Administrative Litigation Law is not "ahead of time." Only by establishing the law can the government be prompted to consider correct law enforcement, frequently use the law to measure and reflect on its own behavior, and reduce illegal administration to the lowest limit.

　　民的忧虑　官的思考
    ——几位人大代表谈行政诉讼法草案
    本报记者  晓渡  袁建达
    青海省海西自治州乌兰县撒拉族农民韩进孝，无官职，无头衔，确确实实是位“民意”代表。谈起正在审议的行政诉讼法草案，他兴奋中带着忧虑。
    “说句实话，大多数农民的文化素质不高，有了法，一时也不会运用它去维护自己的合法利益。很多农民还是认准‘不管有理无理，反正民告不倒当官的’这条谱。”他说，“大伙最怕的是告得不好遭报复哩！”
    北京顺义县乡办企业负责人程春博和青海省民和自治县川口镇制砖厂厂长李福录颇有同感。“权大？法大？这个问题老纠缠不清。法律好是好，可惜到了下边，就抵不上人家的土政策厉害了。”他俩反映，如今基层干部仍习惯按行政命令办事，有此地方现行的某些规定、政策本身就同法律相抵触。这个问题不解决，将来上了公堂，法院是秉公执法呢？还是偏袒那些规定、政策？
    郭本立来自北京市月坛派出所。他分析，若颁布行政诉讼法，目前警方采取的一些应急措施可能会被公民认定为非法而上诉法庭。例如“收容审查”，法律上就没有明确规定。但是如果不对可疑分子采取措施，绝大多数公民的利益就会受到威胁。他建议制订“收容审查”法律，完善法律机制。
    “公民告状也要合法。”河北省永年县杜刘固村党支书谢长民提出了另一种忧虑。他认为今后有了法，也不能把所有对自己不利的行政处罚都看作“非法”，更不可滥诉缠诉。法律既保护公民的合法权益，也制约着公民的行为。为“官”为民都要守法。
    在行政诉讼法的讨论中，我们也听取了一些“官”方的议论。健谈的江西省人大代表、南昌市市长程安东爽快地说，“从法制建设上来看，这确实是件大事。从政府这个角度来看，它有利于摆脱来信来访的纠缠。这些年，很多事都找政府，我是又当市长，又当法官。”他认为有了行诉法，不但能保护公民的合法权益，也能依法保护政府正常行使职权，可以提高办事效率，也可以提高政府威信。他说“民”告“官”没什么可怕，告的好处是可以提高干部执法的自觉性。处理问题不合法、不公正，就会有人告，这正是运用法律约束机制来提高干部的法律意识。“但是，我现在还有两个担心的问题”，程安东又对记者谈他的担心，“一是行诉法是个崭新的法律，开始执行难度必然大，从现在法院审判人员的力量和素质来看，不相适应。群众告上门来，你受理不受理；另一个问题是，目前群众尚不能正确运用这个法律。有的人可能有点不满就去告状，弄不好败诉了，会失去信心。所以，从上到下都要作好准备工作。”
    黑龙江人大代表、鹤岗市市长丁若鹏不隐讳自己对行政诉讼法的疑虑。他说：“现在整个法律法规不配套，执行起来必然会碰到很多矛盾。”他认为当前各方面的条件都不成熟，要实施行诉法会给政府工作带来很大的难度。他说，“现在要抓治理整顿，只要对贪官污吏绳之以法，就不要让民与政府闹对立了。他还担心老老实实的群众受了屈也不敢告，而那些无理纠缠的人则会不断去告状。来自山东的人大代表、一位基层党支部书记则忧虑说，”上面千条线，底下一针穿，要钱、要粮、要计划生育，都是‘得罪’群众的事。民可以告“官”，事情就罗嗦了，让人家告了，真的假的，有理无理，一时说不清，名声也不好听呀。”他呼吁要赶紧制定计划生育法。从各个代表团反映的情况来看，普遍要求制定配套的法律法规。
    福建省的三位代表——漳州市长韩玉琳、三明市长李立士、厦门市长邹尔均，都是年富力强的“官”员，他们认为行政诉讼法制定说不上是“超前”。立了法，才能促使政府去考虑正确执法，经常以法律来衡量和反省自己的行为，把违法行政降到最低限度。
