	Developing diversity and strengthening the main melody are essential for deepening reform and flourishing the arts. This was the consensus reached at a seminar held today by the Propaganda Department's Bureau of Literature and Arts to discuss the implementation of the "Several Opinions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Further Flourishing the Arts."

	The issuance of the "Several Opinions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Further Flourishing the Arts" is a significant event in China's arts sector, which has been warmly welcomed by artists. Participants agreed that over the past decade of reform and opening up, China's arts sector has thrived, achieving unprecedented prosperity. However, new contradictions and issues have emerged in the new situation. In recent years, there has been a tendency to neglect social responsibility, with some lowbrow and even vulgar and negative content seemingly out of control, drawing attention from all sectors of society. Participants suggested that, in accordance with the two basic points and the spirit of the document, while ensuring creative freedom and further encouraging writers and artists to boldly explore and strive for diversity, active measures should be taken to strongly advocate and support works that are beneficial to the Four Modernizations and deepening reform, that inspire people to innovate and strive forward, and that cultivate people's moral character. To this end, the Party's leading departments should intervene less and interfere less in specific artistic issues, focusing instead on providing macro guidance; relevant functional departments should establish and improve socialist arts regulations with Chinese characteristics that adapt to the new order of the commodity economy and the development laws of the arts themselves; writers and artists, while strengthening their subjectivity, should enhance their sense of mission and social responsibility in this era, contributing to the cultivation of a new generation and improving the cultural quality of the entire nation.

	Participants in the seminar included relevant responsible persons from various news agencies and arts publications in the capital.

　　发展多样化　强化主旋律
    中宣部文艺局组织研讨如何繁荣文艺
    据新华社北京４月７日电  深化改革，繁荣文艺，必须继续发展多样化，同时又要强化主旋律。这是今天在中宣部文艺局召开的贯彻《中共中央关于进一步繁荣文艺的若干意见》的研讨会上，与会同志的共同感受。
    《中共中央关于进一步繁荣文艺的若干意见》的发布，是我国文艺领域的一件大事，受到了文艺工作者的热烈拥护。大家认为，改革开放十年来，我国文艺事业蓬勃发展，出现了前所未有的繁荣局面，但是，在新形势下也遇到了新的矛盾和问题，特别是近年来，出现了某些忽视社会责任感的现象，一些格调不高乃至庸俗消极的东西有某种失控之势，引起了社会各界的关注。与会同志提出，要按照两个基本点的要求和文件精神，在切实保证创作自由和进一步鼓励作家艺术家大胆探索、多样求进的同时，采取积极措施，大力提倡扶持一切有利于四化建设和深化改革，有利于激励人们开拓创新、积极进取和陶冶人们道德情操的优秀之作。为此，党的领导部门对具体的文艺问题要少干预、少介入，集中精力搞好宏观引导；有关职能部门要按照适应商品经济新秩序的要求和文艺自身发展规律的要求建立健全有中国特色的社会主义文艺法规；作家艺术家在加强主体意识的同时，要提高自己的时代使命感和社会责任感，为培养一代新人，提高全民族的文化素质做出应有的贡献。
