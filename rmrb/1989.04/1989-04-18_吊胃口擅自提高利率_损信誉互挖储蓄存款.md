Since March 10th, our bank has conducted a sampling survey of the interest rates at two specialized banks and 12 savings institutions in our city. We discovered that these financial institutions have, to varying degrees, violated national interest rate policies. The main manifestations are that they arbitrarily raise savings deposit interest rates to attract depositors. According to the investigation, these banks and savings institutions are competing to raise interest rates in the following ways:

1. **Black Market Type**: Savings clerks, when dealing with depositors, use flexible tactics. For depositors who are unaware of the situation, they handle savings procedures according to the state-regulated interest rates. For those who are aware of the situation or request withdrawals and re-deposits, or directly request high interest rates, they handle it with "black market" interest rates. Some even specially instruct the depositors: "Keep it secret."

2. **Open Warfare Type**: In this arbitrary interest rate war, some savings offices even engage in "publicized operations," openly displaying the arbitrarily raised interest rate standards, which has a very negative impact. On the afternoon of March 13th, a savings office of a certain specialized bank in our city hung a sign at the entrance that read, "One-year fixed deposit, annual interest rate 18%, the highest in the city."

3. **Disguised Type**: This situation often involves raising interest rates indirectly through bonds and other forms. Because this method of raising interest rates is indirect, it is more concealed and less likely to be discovered.

We believe that specialized banks, regardless of the form they use to compete for savings, must strictly implement national interest rate policies; otherwise, they will suffer irreparable losses.

　　吊胃口擅自提高利率　损信誉互挖储蓄存款
    ３月１０日以来，我行对我市的两个专业银行、１２个储蓄机构的利率情况作了一次抽样调查，发现这些金融机构都不同程度地存在违反国家利率政策的问题。其主要表现是，擅自提高储蓄存款利率吸引储户。据调查，这些银行和储蓄机构竞相提高利率有以下几种类型：
    黑市交易型。储蓄员接待储户时，采用灵活的应变方式，即对不知内情的储户，按国家规定的利率办理储蓄手续，对已知内情或要求提款转存，或直接要求存高利率的储户，则以“黑市”利率处理，有的还特意关照储户：“注意保密”。
    公开混战型。在这场擅自提高利率的混战中，有的储蓄所竟搞起了“挂牌营业”，将擅自提高的利率标准公布于众，影响极坏。３月１３日下午，我市某专业银行储蓄所门口挂起了“定期一年存款，年息１８％，全市最高”字样的牌子。
    变相隐蔽型。这种情况，多以债券等形式变相提高利率。由于这种提高利率的办法具有间接性，所以隐蔽性较强，不易被发现。
    我们认为，专业银行不论采取什么形式展开储蓄竞争，都必须严格执行国家利率政策，否则将造成难以挽回的损失。
