	One Pays, One Sells a Kidney
	The Controversy of the Human Organ Retail Business

	West Germany recently saw the emergence of a human organ trading agency, which specializes in purchasing removable human organs and selling them to patients desperately in need of organ transplants. The agency's owner, Ademan, stated that he has received over 1,000 letters from kidney patients across Europe, expressing their willingness to pay high prices for healthy kidneys.

	According to the *Sunday Times*, at least 60 British individuals are ready to sell one of their kidneys. Ademan's agency can arrange for hospitals to perform the transplant surgeries for both buyers and sellers. A woman from Hamburg will travel to a Paris hospital in April to receive a kidney sold by a German man for 20,000 pounds. This will be the first transaction facilitated by the agency.

	Most individuals willing to donate their organs are economically disadvantaged, with some aiming to pay off debts and others seeking funds for retirement. According to *The Times*, there are currently 3,700 kidney patients in Britain in need of transplants, but the supply of living kidneys is far from meeting the demand.

	The British government views the retail of human organs as "horrifying and unacceptable," and plans to crack down on this burgeoning international "business." The European Community and the World Medical Association have both issued statements advocating for the prohibition of human organ trading, but with little effect. Ademan, however, believes his business is "humane": the buyer receives a healthy kidney and saves their life, while the seller gains money and escapes poverty, resulting in a "win-win" situation. "This is doing good. Should we let some people die because they lack money, while others die because they lack a kidney?"

	As a broker in the human organ trade, Ademan's commission fees are substantial. He is confident that his "business" will continue to thrive. However, this pioneer of the new industry has yet to find a solution for the two psychological imbalances it creates: first, the impression it gives society is that those sacrificing part of their flesh and risking their lives are the poor, while the rich are the ones being saved, which is heart-wrenching; second, as an elderly woman with kidney failure for many years said, "I desperately need a new kidney, but the thought of having someone else's kidney in my abdomen makes me shudder."

### 一个出钱　一个卖肾  人体器官零售业的争议

　　一个出钱　一个卖肾
    人体器官零售业的争议
    西德最近出现了一个人体器官交易介绍所，专门收购可摘除的人体器官，转卖给迫切需要更换某个器官的病人。该介绍所的老板阿德曼说，他已收到从欧洲各国肾病患者寄来的１０００多封信，表示愿意出高价购买正常肾脏。
    据《星期日泰晤士报》报道，至少有６０个英国人已准备把他们的一个肾脏出售。阿德曼的介绍所可以替买卖双方安排做移植手术的医院。汉堡一位妇女将于４月到巴黎一家医院去移植一位本国男子以２万英镑出售的肾。这将是该介绍所促成的第一宗买卖。
    愿意割让自身器官的人绝大部分是经济困难者，有的为还债，有的则是想得一笔钱养老。据《泰晤士报》调查，英国现有３７００名肾病患者需做肾移植手术，但活肾的供应量远不能满足需要。
    英国政府认为零售活人器官是“可怕的和不能接受的”，计划取缔这种渐渐成为国际性的“商业”。欧洲共同体和世界医学协会都曾发表文件，主张禁止人体器官买卖的活动，但收效甚微。而阿德曼则认为他经营这种生意是“人道”的：买方得到了健全的肾而挽救了自己的生命，卖方得到了钱，解除了穷困危机，“两全其美”。“这是在做好事。难道应该让一些人因缺钱而死，同时让另一些人缺肾而死吗？”
    作为人体器官买卖的掮客，阿德曼的介绍费收入颇丰。他坚信他的“事业”将越来越兴旺。不过，这位新行业开创者尚无办法解决由此引起的两种心理失衡：其一是这种买卖给社会造成的印象是：牺牲一部分血肉并危及自身生命的是穷人，受到拯救的是富人，令人心酸；其二则如一位患肾功能衰竭多年的老太太所说：“我很需要换一个新肾，可是一想到肚子里将有一个别人的肾脏时，我就打寒噤。”
