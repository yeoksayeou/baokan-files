Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 7th.

The offices of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the State Council, and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held a joint meeting in Beijing this morning, urging various departments to handle the suggestions from National People's Congress deputies and proposals from National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference members with a serious and responsible attitude.

It was reported that the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress received 3,778 suggestions from deputies, and the Second Session of the Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference received 1,918 proposals from members. At today's meeting, these suggestions and proposals were distributed to the relevant agencies.

Vice Secretary-General of the State Council, Shi Dexiang, said in his speech that handling suggestions from National People's Congress deputies and proposals from National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference members is an important aspect of accepting supervision from the people and improving government work. He required the relevant agencies to actively handle the suggestions and proposals, actively cooperate, strengthen communication and investigation with the proposers, and provide feedback on the handling of suggestions and proposals to the deputies and members by August 31. The content of the feedback should comply with laws and regulations, comply with the relevant policies and regulations of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and comply with the actual situation. It should also be a point-by-point response, avoiding empty talk and irrelevant answers.

Shi Dexiang said that for suggestions and proposals, those that can be resolved should be resolved seriously, and those that cannot be resolved at the moment should also explain the situation and clarify it to the deputies and members. Those that can be resolved with effort should not be easily classified as unresolved. For problems that cannot be solved, do not make empty promises or issue blank checks.

Vice Secretary-General of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Lin Yousan, hoped that in handling the proposals from National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference members, various agencies would strengthen their democratic consciousness and improve their understanding of handling proposals.

The heads of the offices and departments of the Central Military Commission, the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and the Party Central Committee and the State Council attended the meeting.
