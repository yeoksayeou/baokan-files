The grain inspection station on National Highway 107 in Tian'e Village, Dianmen Township, Hengshan County, our city, has been extorting money from passing drivers since it was established in October last year. During this year's Spring Festival, a truck carrying fireworks from Liuyang County was stopped by this grain inspection station. The inspectors, citing the lack of a transport inspection certificate, forcibly unloaded 8 boxes of fireworks, selling 7 boxes to individual merchants for 1,400 yuan in cash, and privately dividing the remaining box among themselves. An individual merchant transporting some jeans from Guangxi was extorted out of 10 pairs of jeans. A truck carrying sheep was stopped, and the inspectors extorted one sheep from the owner. A truck carrying charcoal was stopped, and the owner had to give them 5 baskets of charcoal to privately divide. Similar extortion incidents frequently occur here. Additionally, they have privately divided some of the intercepted rice. The public refers to this grain inspection station as an extortion station.

　　是粮检站，还是敲诈站
    我市衡山县店门乡天鹅村１０７国道线上的粮食检查站去年１０月成立以来，多次敲诈勒索过往车辆的司机。今年春节期间，浏阳县一辆装运花炮的汽车被这个粮检站拦住，有关检查人员以无检查运输证为由，强行卸下８箱花炮，将其中的７箱卖给个体户，得现金１４００元，剩下的一箱私分了。一个体户从广西带１些牛仔裤路过这里，被勒索了１０条牛仔裤。一辆运羊的汽车被拦住后，检查人员敲诈了货主的一头羊。一辆装有木炭的汽车路过此地，货主只好拿出５篓木炭让他们私分。类似的敲诈勒索事情，在这里常常发生。此外，他们还私分了一部分拦截的大米。群众称这个粮检站为敲诈站。
