Title: Who is Responsible for Traffic Tragedies?

In urban intersections, people often see signs reporting traffic fatalities. These signs are striking, and from them, one can imagine the screams under the wheels and the moans of mangled flesh… Traffic accidents, this unannounced killer, year after year, day after day, approaches the flesh and blood of some people. What is puzzling is that although traffic violations are the prelude to traffic accidents, almost every city has a large group of traffic violators.

At the Tianjin Public Security Traffic Brigade, the reporter saw a shocking figure: last year, the number of traffic violations recorded was 5,116,316 instances. Among these 5 million violators, 1,425,902 were penalized for more serious offenses. Tianjin City had 4,701 traffic accidents last year, resulting in 470 deaths, 2,993 injuries, and direct property losses amounting to 5,783,115 yuan. These four figures, all higher than the previous year, came from this large group of violators.

Experts believe that modern urban traffic engineering is a new interdisciplinary field that involves the comprehensive arrangement of people, vehicles, roads, cars, and management. However, at the core of this complex system is still the main subject: people.

“Don’t push!” This is a common cry in the midst of bustling traffic. Although it only takes a minute to enter in an orderly fashion, people prefer to crowd together rather than give way. Similarly, many people are willing to spend two hours on a meal, but when crossing a road on red, they are impatient and rush, counting every second. The inverted mindset exposed in road traffic is an important internal cause of traffic accidents. In January of this year, Tianjin alone had 5 serious accidents in one week where cars collided with trains, resulting in 12 deaths, 17 injuries, and severe property damage. The lack of guards and outdated road equipment, and the blind spots when vehicles go uphill are objective difficulties. However, car drivers only need to take a few minutes to look around and can pass safely, but they still rush through, making serious mistakes. Notably, they are not the first batch of casualties in the accident area, and who can guarantee they are the last batch?

If the above-mentioned inverted mindset is a product of historical accumulation, then with the rise of materialism, it has injected new catalysts into traffic violations. On September 26 last year, on the Tianjin-Tanggu Road, a large bus suddenly ran over a girl named Peng Yuan Yuan who was riding a bicycle in the same direction, killing her. The reason was that a Tanggu public bus driver took leave to make extra money driving for an individual entrepreneur. The car owner and driver, thinking only of making money, did not check the brakes for two months, ultimately leading to the tragedy. This is a new trend: most transportation households in the suburbs of Tianjin, after their business takes off, usually hire workers for 500 yuan a month to drive, and after insuring the car, they think, “the profits are mine, and if anything happens, the insurance company will be responsible.” Last year, 368 people died in traffic accidents in the suburbs of Tianjin, accounting for 78.3% of the city's fatalities, an increase of 13.4% over the previous year, which is closely related to the car owners not caring about the vehicle's condition and the drivers rushing.

These issues call for strong restraints. Whether it is the infusion of legal awareness, the cultivation of professional ethics, or the strengthening of traffic law enforcement, all are urgently needed. Moreover, the number of police officers nationwide accounts for six per ten thousand of the population, and in Tianjin, traffic police account for only 3.8 per ten thousand of the population. There are not enough traffic police, and traffic accidents are beyond prevention.

On the issue of police strictly enforcing the law, some citizens also have stubborn reverse psychology. Tianjin had no reports of traffic police beating people last year, but there were 98 cases of violators injuring police officers. Public security traffic department officials told the reporter: In laws and regulations related to traffic management, there are some obvious omissions. For example, in some countries, any losses caused by traffic violations are not compensated. But in our country, even if the accident is entirely the fault of the injured party, the relevant vehicle still has to pay the corresponding compensation.

Reducing traffic accidents involves many aspects such as road expansion, strengthening police forces, and scientific equipment, but one thing is certain: if the public pays attention to consciously eliminating the confused mindset at traffic lights, traffic tragedies will decrease significantly!

　　交通悲剧谁造成
    本报记者　肖荻
    在城市街区道口上，人们常会看到通告交通伤亡事故的牌子。它赫然入目，人们从那里可以想见那些车轮辗压下的惨叫，血肉模糊的呻吟……车祸，这不宣而战的杀手，年复一年、日复一日地向一些人们的血肉之躯逼近。令人困惑不解的是，尽管交通违章现象是交通事故的前奏，但几乎各个城市都有庞大的交通违章群。
    在天津公安交通大队，记者看到一个令人吃惊的数字：去年全年发生交通违章的记录是５１１６３１６人次。在这５００多万违章者中因情节较重而受到处罚的人次是１４２５９０２。而天津市去年发生交通事故４７０１次，死亡４７０人，伤２９９３人，车物直接损失５７８３１１５元，这４项比前年均有所上升的数字，就出自这庞大的违章群。
    专家们认为，现代城市交通工程学是一门跨部门、跨学科的新兴交叉学科，涉及人、物、路、车、管五要素的统筹安排。然而，居于这一复杂的系统工程枢纽地位的，仍是交通的主体：人。
    “别挤啦！”这是车水马龙中遍地可闻的呼声。尽管鱼贯而入只用一分钟，但人们宁可挤成一团，也不肯退让一步。同样，许多人尽管可以会餐两小时而在所不惜，但在过道口闯红灯时却急不可待，分秒必争。在马路交通中暴露无遗的这一倒错心态，成为诱发交通事故的重要内因。天津市今年１月中旬仅在１周之内，竟连续发生５起汽车与火车相撞的恶性事故，导致１２人丧命，１７人受伤，车物损失惨重。无人看守、道口装置落后，车辆上坡有时视角有盲区，这是客观难点，然而汽车司机只须花上两三分钟左顾右盼一下便可安然通过，但还是贸然闯关，铸成大错。值得注意的是，他们并不是出事地段伤亡的第一批，谁又能断定他们是伤亡的最后一批？
    如果说，上述这种倒错心态属于一种历史的积淀，那么伴随着拜金热，更情不自禁地为交通违章现象注入了新的催化剂。去年９月２６日在津塘公路上，一辆大客车无端地将一顺行骑车少女彭媛媛轧死，其原因是塘沽一公共汽车司机请事假，捞外快为个体户开车，一心想发财的车主、司机只顾赚钱，两个月未检查一次刹车终于导致惨剧。这是一种最新动向：天津郊县大多数运输专业户，在家业发起来以后，一般是花５００元一月雇工开车，同时在为车保上险之后，则认为“赚钱归我，出事由保险公司负责”。天津去年郊县共因交通死亡３６８人，占全市死亡事故的７８．３％，比前年上升１３．４％，这与车主不顾车况、司机拚命跑车密切相关。
    这些，呼唤强有力的制约。无论是法制意识的灌输，职业道德的熏陶，交通执法的强化，都是迫不及待的。而且，民警人数在全国占人口比例的万分之六，在天津，交通民警仅占人口的万分之三点八。交通民警人力不够，交通事故防不胜防。
    在民警严格执勤这个问题上，也有一些市民持执拗的逆反心理。天津去年未发生一件交通民警打人的举报事件，但却发生了９８起违章者打伤民警的事件。公安交通部门的同志向记者谈到：在有关交通管理的法律、法规上，有一些明显的疏漏。如：在一些国家，凡因交通违章而招致的事故损失，不予任何赔偿。但在我国，即便事故责任完全属于伤亡者本人，有关车辆仍要付出相应赔偿。
    压缩交通事故，涉及道路开拓、加强警力、科学装置等诸多方面，但有一点是可以预期的：如果社会公众注意自觉祛除一下红绿灯前的迷离心态，交通悲剧将直线下降！
