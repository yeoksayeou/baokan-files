	BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- At the invitation of the Japanese government, Premier Li Peng left Beijing by special plane this morning for an official friendly visit to Japan.

	Before departing, Li Peng held a press conference at the capital airport, discussing his visit to Japan and answering questions from reporters. Premier Li Peng said that the purpose of this visit is to further develop friendly relations between China and Japan. He said, perhaps reporters have this question: Why, in the current situation where Japan's political situation has some turmoil, are we still going ahead with this visit as scheduled? This visit is a return visit to Prime Minister Takeshita's visit to China last August, and the time for this visit has already been determined. The fluctuations in Japan's political situation will not affect my visit this time, because this is a state visit. The purpose of our visit is to focus on the further development of Sino-Japanese friendly relations. Since the Japanese side has not mentioned any difficulties in receiving me and my colleagues, we will proceed with the visit as scheduled.

	When asked about some activities during the visit to Japan, Li Peng said that during this visit to Japan, it has been arranged for us to meet with His Majesty the Emperor, which makes me very happy. During the meeting, we will respect Japanese customs and discuss relevant issues. As for what issues will be discussed, it is not appropriate to announce now, and it also depends on the situation of the discussion.

	When asked by a reporter from the Japanese Asahi Shimbun Television, whether the Chinese government will play a mediating role in the improvement of relations between Japan and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and whether the improvement of Japan-DPRK relations will become an important topic in the talks between Premier Li Peng and Prime Minister Takeshita, Li Peng said that undoubtedly, I will exchange views with Prime Minister Takeshita on international issues, and the situation on the Korean Peninsula is one of the issues we will exchange views on. We have noted that Prime Minister Takeshita recently made a speech on the issue of Japan's war responsibility towards Korea. It can be said that North Korea has responded to this cautiously and positively. As far as I know, the North Korean side is willing to have a dialogue with Japan, but they think that in addition to listening to speeches, they also want to see actual actions. Premier Li Peng also said that China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have a very good relationship, so our leaders often visit each other. This visit by General Secretary Zhao Ziyang is his first visit abroad since he became General Secretary, and his first visit is to Korea, which shows that the relationship between the two countries is extraordinary.

	When asked by a reporter from the Hong Kong South China Morning Post about the health condition of Hu Yaobang, who has a good impression among many people in Japan, Li Peng said that Comrade Hu Yaobang has been unwell recently and is being treated in the hospital. We are all concerned about his health. For example, I visited him in the hospital on Sunday morning. His condition has improved. His illness this time has nothing to do with the Politburo meeting.

	When asked by an Indian reporter which country is the fifth country to be visited after Japan as the fourth country visited since taking office as Premier, Li Peng said that I still have some visit schedules this year, for example, I plan to visit Western Europe and to Pakistan and Bangladesh. These countries are all in the list of the fifth country to be visited, but which one it is has not been finally determined yet.

	Accompanying Premier Li Peng on the visit are Mrs. Li Peng, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Zheng Tuobin, Deputy Director of the State Planning Commission Gan Ziyu, and others.

	Those who saw Premier Li Peng off to the airport included: Vice Premiers Yao Yilin and Wu Xueqian, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General of the State Council Lu Ronggan, and others.

	TOKYO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- At the invitation of the Japanese government, Premier Li Peng arrived in Tokyo by special plane today for a five-day official friendly visit to Japan.

	At 2:00 PM (Tokyo time), the special plane carrying Li Peng and his entourage landed at Tokyo's Haneda Airport. The Japanese government's chief reception officer, Director of Ceremonies of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Murakado Yasushi, and Chinese Ambassador to Japan Yang Zhenya and others boarded the plane to welcome them. Premier Li Peng and his wife, Mrs. Zhu Lin, smiled and waved to the welcoming crowd as they walked to the door of the cabin. They then descended the stairs and shook hands warmly with Japanese Ambassador to China Nakajima Bunjiro, Director-General of the Asian Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Hasegawa Kazuyoshi, and other Japanese officials, as well as officials from the Chinese Embassy and representatives of Chinese institutions in Japan. Two young women from the Chinese Embassy presented flowers to Li Peng and his wife. Students from the Yokohama Chinese School waved the flags of China and Japan, welcoming Li Peng and his entourage.

	Premier Li Peng delivered a written speech at the airport. He said: "Japan is a highly developed country, and the Japanese people are hardworking, intelligent, and full of pioneering spirit. As I step onto your land, I would like to extend my warm greetings and best wishes to the people of Japan! The long-term stability of Sino-Japanese friendly relations is not only beneficial to the two countries and peoples but also in line with the trend of maintaining peace and promoting development in the world. During my visit, I will have extensive contact with people from all walks of life in your country and exchange in-depth views on how to further strengthen the development momentum of the two countries' relations in the new situation and create a new situation of friendly cooperation between the two countries. I believe that with the thoughtful arrangements of the host side, this visit will definitely be a complete success. Sino-Japanese relations will also definitely make new progress under the guidance of the Sino-Japanese Joint Communiqué, the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between China and Japan, and other principles."

	Premier Li Peng and his entourage were escorted by Murakado Yasushi and others to the Akasaka Guest House in Tokyo. The streets near the guest house were decorated with the flags of China and Japan.

	TOKYO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru held a grand ceremony at the Akasaka Guest House in Tokyo this afternoon to welcome Premier Li Peng.

	At 3:30 PM, Prime Minister Takeshita and his wife came to the guest house and shook hands with Premier Li Peng and his wife, exchanging greetings and expressing warm welcome to Li Peng and his entourage's visit to Japan.

	When Premier Li Peng walked onto the review stand with Prime Minister Takeshita, the military band played the national anthems of both countries. Then, Li Peng and Takeshita inspected the honor guard. As the two leaders passed by the welcoming crowd, nearly 400 students from Chinese schools and Japanese schools waved the flags of China and Japan, welcoming Premier Li Peng. Li Peng waved back to the students happily.

	It is reported that Prime Minister Takeshita held a grand banquet at the Prime Minister's official residence in the evening to welcome Premier Li Peng.

	Tonight, the Prime Minister's official residence was filled with the atmosphere of Sino-Japanese friendship. Prime Minister Takeshita and Premier Li Peng delivered speeches one after another (see page three for details). (Accompanied by photos)

　　应邀对日本进行正式友好访问
　　李鹏总理离北京抵东京
　　竹下首相举行仪式宴会欢迎
    本报北京4月12日讯　记者孙毅报道：应日本国政府的邀请，国务院总理李鹏今天上午乘专机离开北京，前往日本进行正式友好访问。
    离京前，李鹏在首都机场举行了中外记者招待会，谈他的日本之行，并回答了记者们的问题。李鹏总理说，这次访问的目的在于进一步发展中日两国之间的友好关系。他说，也许各位记者有这样一个问题，为什么在日本政局目前产生一些动荡的情况下，我们还要如期地进行这次访问？我这次访问是对竹下首相去年8月份对中国访问的一次回访，而且这次访问的时间在上次就已经确定了的。日本政局的一些波动，不会影响我的这次访问，因为我们这次访问是一次国事访问，我们访问的目的是着眼于中日友好关系的进一步发展。既然日本方面没有提出来对接待我和我的同事们有什么困难，那我们将如期地进行访问。
    日本《读卖新闻》的记者问及访日的某些活动内容时，李鹏说，在这次访日过程中，已经安排了我们要会见天皇陛下，这使我感到高兴。在会见的过程中，我们将尊重日本的习惯，就有关问题进行交谈。至于交谈什么问题，当然现在还不好宣布，另外也要视交谈的情况而定。
    日本《朝日新闻》电视台的记者问，日本政府希望改善同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的关系，中国和朝鲜之间有着非常好的关系，赵紫阳总书记不久就要到平壤去。对于日朝关系的改善，中国政府会不会起一种调节的作用？这次李鹏总理同竹下登首相的会谈当中，日朝关系改善的问题会不会成为重要的议题？李鹏说，毫无疑问，我在同竹下首相的会谈中将就国际问题广泛地交换意见，朝鲜半岛的局势也是我们要交换的问题之一。我们注意到，竹下首相最近关于朝鲜的战争责任问题发表的谈话。应该说北朝鲜对此作出了谨慎的、欢迎的反应。据我知道，北朝鲜方面是愿意和日本对话的，但是，他们认为除了听听讲话，还要看看实际行动。李鹏总理还说，中国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国之间有非常好的关系，因此我们两国领导人经常进行互访。这次赵紫阳总书记的访问，是他担任总书记以后的第一次出访，第一次出访就到朝鲜，显示了两国的关系是不寻常的。
    香港《南华早报》的记者问，在日本许多人对胡耀邦有很好的印象，他们对他的身体健康情况表示关心。请问他是不是在星期六的一次政治局开会的时候病倒了？李鹏说，胡耀邦同志最近身体欠安，正在医院治疗。我们对他的健康都很关心。如我本人就在星期日上午到医院探望他。他的病情已经有所好转。他这次生病与政治局会议没有什么直接的关系。
    一位印度记者问，日本是你任总理以后出访的第四个国家，请问第五个国家是哪一个，李鹏说，我今年还有一些访问日程，比如我准备到西欧以及对巴基斯坦和孟加拉国进行访问。这些国家都在我访问的第五个国家的名单之中，具体是哪一个现在还没有最后确定。
    陪同李鹏总理出访的有李鹏总理的夫人朱琳，外交部长钱其琛，经贸部长郑拓彬，国家计委副主任甘子玉等。
    前往机场送行的有：国务院副总理姚依林和吴学谦、全国人大常委会副委员长习仲勋、国务院秘书长罗干等。
    本报东京4月12日电　记者于青报道：应日本国政府邀请，李鹏总理今天乘专机从北京抵达东京，对日本进行为期5天的正式友好访问。
    下午两点整（东京时间），李鹏一行乘坐的专机降落在东京羽田机场。日本政府首席接待官、外务省仪典长村角泰和中国驻日本大使杨振亚等登机迎接。李鹏总理和夫人朱琳走到机舱口，笑容满面地向欢迎的人们挥手致意。然后走下舷梯，同前来欢迎的日本驻中国大使中岛敏次郎、外务省亚洲局长长谷川和年以及中国大使馆官员、驻日机构代表亲切握手。我国驻日使馆两名女青年向李鹏和夫人献花。横滨华侨中华学校小学生挥动中日两国国旗，欢迎李鹏一行来日访问。
    李鹏总理在机场发表了书面讲话。他说：“日本是个经济高度发达的国家，日本人民勤劳智慧、富于进取精神。在我踏上贵国土地之际，我首先向广大日本人民致以亲切的问候和良好的祝愿！中日友好关系的长期稳定不仅对两国和两国人民有利，也符合维护和平、促进发展的世界潮流。访问期间，我将同贵国朝野各界人士广泛接触，围绕在新的形势下如何进一步加强两国关系发展势头，开创两国友好合作的新局面深入交换意见。我相信，在主人方面的周到安排下，这次访问一定会取得圆满成功。中日关系也一定能够在中日联合声明、中日和平友好条约以及其他各项原则指导下，不断取得新的进展。”
    李鹏总理一行由村角泰等陪同乘车前往东京赤坂迎宾馆。迎宾馆附近的街道上，悬挂着中日两国国旗。
    本报东京4月12日电　记者于青报道：日本首相竹下登今天下午在东京赤坂迎宾馆举行隆重仪式，欢迎李鹏总理。
    3时30分，竹下首相和夫人来到迎宾馆，同李鹏总理和夫人亲切握手，互致问候，对李鹏一行来日访问表示热烈欢迎。
    当李鹏总理在竹下首相陪同下走上检阅台时，军乐队高奏中日两国国歌。接着，李鹏和竹下登检阅了仪仗队，当两国领导人经过欢迎队伍前时，近400名华侨学校学生和日本小学生挥动中日两国国旗向李鹏总理表示欢迎。李鹏高兴地向学生们挥手致意。
