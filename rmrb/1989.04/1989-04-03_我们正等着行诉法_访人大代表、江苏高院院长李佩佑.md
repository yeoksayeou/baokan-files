Before meeting Comrade Li Peiyou, I thought he would talk to me about the difficulties in implementing the Administrative Litigation Law. To my surprise, this calm judge spoke to me in a measured tone: "We need the Administrative Litigation Law now. We are waiting for it."

It turns out that two years ago, they had already started accepting administrative litigation cases to adapt to the needs of the reform. In just over a year, from 1987 to 1988, nearly a thousand administrative litigation cases were accepted and adjudicated. At that time, the cases mainly involved public security, land management, fisheries, and taxation. Since there was no Administrative Litigation Law, they had to use the Civil Procedure Law and relevant documents issued by the Supreme People's Court to handle these cases.

As the number of administrative litigation cases increased, the Jiangsu Higher People's Court quickly adapted to the situation by establishing administrative trial courts. Now, 75% of the higher, intermediate, and county (district) level people's courts in the province have established administrative trial courts. They also trained personnel, selecting a group of officials who had long been engaged in civil trial work, had a certain legal foundation, and could enforce the law impartially for training. On the other hand, they carried out theoretical research on administrative trials and analyzed difficult cases.

Perhaps because of these "forward-looking" actions, they do not think the Administrative Litigation Law is "forward-looking." However, he still expressed his views on my question (what problems do you think need to be solved in implementing the Administrative Litigation Law). He believes that the Administrative Litigation Law should protect the legal rights of citizens and also ensure and supervise administrative organs in exercising their powers according to law. This requires propaganda work from two aspects. On one hand, it is necessary to let the people understand the Administrative Litigation Law, know that citizens can sue officials, and understand what to sue for and how to sue, so as to use legal weapons to protect their legal rights. On the other hand, it is necessary to let administrative organs, especially leaders, understand the importance of administering according to law and defending according to law. They should study and understand the laws, especially those related to their exercise of powers, so as to maintain the legal power of administration according to law. When they become the "defendant" and believe they are not wrong, they can present evidence to argue their case. The court provides a place for both parties to argue. In the process of exercising their legal powers, they can enhance their legal awareness and understand the power of law.

### “我们正等着行诉法”——访人大代表、江苏高院院长李佩佑

　　“我们正等着行诉法”
    ——访人大代表、江苏高院院长李佩佑
    本报记者  晓渡
    见到李佩佑同志之前，我以为他会向我说一些当前要实施行政诉讼法的难处。没想到，这位沉着的法官一板一眼地对我说：“现在很需要有行政诉讼法，我们正等着这个法呢。”
    原来，两年前，他们适应改革形势的需要，就已经开始受理行政诉讼案件了。仅一九八七年到一九八八年一年多时间，受理和审结的行政诉讼案件就有近千件。当时主要是治安、土地管理、渔政和税务等等。因为没有行诉法，只能运用民事诉讼法和最高人民法院下达的有关文件去办。
    随着行政诉讼案件的增多，江苏省高级人民法院赶紧适应形势需要，建立行政审判庭，现在全省高、中和县（区）级人民法院百分之七十五已建立了行政审判庭。他们又着手培训了干部，抽出一部分长期从事民事审判工作、有一定法律基础知识、能公正执法的干部去进行培训。另一方面还开展了行政审判的理论研究和对疑难案件的分析工作。
    大概正因为他们有了这些“超前”的行动，也就不认为行诉法“超前”了。但是，他还是就我的问题（你认为实施行政诉讼法要解决哪些问题），发表了他的见解。他认为行政诉讼法，要依法保护公民的合法权益，也要依法保障和监督行政机关依法行使职权。这就需要从两个方面来做好宣传工作，一方面要让广大人民了解行诉法，知道“民”可以告官，还要懂得告什么，怎么告，这才能运用法律武器保护自己的合法权益。另一方面，要让行政机关，特别是领导，懂得依法行政，依法应诉。把法律，特别是与自己行使职权有关的法律学好弄通，也才能依法来维护行政的合法权力。当自己成为“被告”，又认为并没有错的情况下，可以拿出证据来据理力争，法庭为双方都提供讲理的地方。在行使自己合法权力的过程中，才能增强法律意识，才能认识法律的威力。
