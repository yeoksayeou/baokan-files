The Potter
Feng Jie

	Through his imagination, unrooted and branchless,
	He chooses the most ordinary clay of the Central Plains,
	Sculpts many doves,
	Ignites a piece of glaze, and the doves,
	Fly out in a vibrant display of folk art.
	Whether in a hanging plate or a painted pot, they are like rainbows and water.
	In this kiln, low and dark yellow like rice sheaves,
	He creates the most classical and modern plants,
	Forming another expanse of porcelain grassland.
	Under his clumsy fingers,
	The doves' wings cut through a sweet scent,
	Cut through the brilliant moment of astonishment before the kiln.
	His clumsy fingers, like branches, nest the glazed doves,
	Like the most beautiful camphor leaves.

　　陶工
　　冯杰
    凭自己无根须无枝叶的想象
    选择中原最平常色的泥土
    雕塑出许多鸽子
    点燃一片火　釉色鸽儿
    翻飞出绚丽的民间艺术
    无论挂盘或彩陶　都如虹如水
    在这低如暗黄稻垛的陶窑
    流漾出最古典最现代的植物
    组成另一片瓷色草原
    在拙笨的手指下
    鸽子的翅膀划出一阵甜香
    划出窑前那瞬间惊叹的灿烂
    拙笨的手指如枝　栖息釉色鸽子
    像最美丽的楠木叶子
