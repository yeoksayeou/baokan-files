In late March, an international conference on the "waste problem" was held in Basel, Switzerland. After repeated discussions and consultations, the participating developing countries from the South and the developed countries from the North reached an agreement on the import and export of waste. This is another global environmental agreement following the Montreal Protocol on the protection of the ozone layer. It is not easy for South and North countries to reach a consensus on waste disposal.

Readers may recall the "waste war" between the South and the North, which caused quite a stir. Last spring, an Italian cargo ship, loaded with a large amount of "chemical products," made a global voyage, traveling tens of thousands of miles, visiting ports in Europe, Africa, and Latin America. However, all the ports it visited refused to unload its cargo. It turned out that the ship was not carrying "chemical products" but toxic industrial waste. Southern countries angrily condemned the deceptive behavior of Northern countries, while Northern countries believed that the buying and selling of waste fell under the category of "free trade" and should not be restricted. At the time, public opinion held that the "waste problem" involved political, legal, and technical difficulties, and that each side had its own interests, making it difficult to find a mutually beneficial solution.

However, one year later, developing countries and developed countries found a compromise solution in Basel. The agreement reached this time has two prerequisites: First, Southern countries acknowledge that Northern countries indeed face a "waste problem" and agree to cooperate, allowing them to export waste to Southern countries, changing their previous stance of outright rejection. Second, Northern countries recognize the need to fully respect the sovereignty and interests of Southern countries. Looking at the specific contents of the agreement, it is clear that the exporting countries of waste must comply with many strict regulations. For example, they must submit a detailed cargo manifest to the receiving country in advance, and only after obtaining the consent of the receiving country can the ship set sail. If the exporting country's manifest contains false information, once discovered, the waste must be returned to its "place of origin."

The Basel Agreement shows that while the East and West are seeking détente, the South and North are also exploring effective ways to resolve economic, environmental, and other conflicts. Here, the sincerity of cooperation is important. With this sincerity, the level of conflict can be reduced, and various forms of "trade wars" and "environmental wars" can be minimized.

　　南北方国家达成“垃圾协议”
　　郑园园
    ３月下旬，在瑞士巴塞尔召开了一个“垃圾问题”的国际会议，参加会议的南、北方发展中国家和发达国家经过反复讨论和磋商，达成了一个关于进、出口垃圾的协议。这是继保护臭氧层的蒙特利尔协议之后，又一个世界性的环保协议。南、北方国家在垃圾处理问题上达成一致，殊为不易。
    读者大概还记得南北之间的“垃圾大战”曾闹得沸沸扬扬。去年春天，意大利的一艘货轮，载着大批“化工产品”作了一次环球旅行，行程数万里，到达过欧洲、非洲、拉丁美洲，但所到的港口，全都拒绝它卸货，原来，船上装载的不是什么“化工产品”，而是含毒的工业废料。南方国家愤怒谴责北方国家的欺诈行为，北方国家则以为，垃圾的买和卖，属于“自由贸易”范畴，不应受到限制。当时的舆论认为，“垃圾问题”涉及到政治、法律、技术诸多方面的难题，南北国家各有各的利益，很难找到两全之计。
    然而，一年后的今天，发展中国家和发达国家却在巴塞尔共同寻找着折衷的解决办法。此次达成协议有两个前提：一是南方国家承认北方国家确实面临着“垃圾难题”，同意予以合作，允许它们向南方国家出口垃圾，改变了从前一味拒绝的立场；二是北方国家认识到必须充分尊重南方国家的主权和利益。看看协议的具体内容就知道，垃圾出口国必须遵守许多严格的规定，例如，它得事先向接受垃圾的国家递交详细的货物报告单，只有在取得接受国同意之后，轮船才能启航。如果出口国的报告单有不实之处，一经发现，垃圾就得被遣返“原籍”。
    巴塞尔协议使我们看到，在东西方谋求缓和的同时，南北方也在探寻着有效地解决经济、环保等方面矛盾的新路子。在这里，合作的诚意是重要的，有了这种诚意，才能降低冲突程度，减少那剑拔弩张、形形色色的“贸易战”、“环保战”。
