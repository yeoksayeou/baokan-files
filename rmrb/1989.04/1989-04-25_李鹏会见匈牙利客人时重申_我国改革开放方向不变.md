Li Peng Reiterates China's Unwavering Commitment to Reform and Opening Up During Meeting with Hungarian Guests

New China News Agency, Beijing, April 25 (Reporter Zhang Rongdian) Premier Li Peng stated today during a meeting with Hungarian guests that although China has encountered some temporary difficulties, the direction of reform and opening up will not change.

Li Peng met with the Hungarian government delegation led by the Hungarian Chairman of the China-Hungary Economic, Trade, and Scientific and Technological Cooperation Committee and Deputy Prime Minister, Majes Peter, this afternoon in the Ziguang Pavilion in Zhongnanhai.

In introducing the domestic situation in China, Li Peng said that over the past 10 years of reform and opening up, China has achieved many successes, but it has also encountered some problems, such as high inflation. This is due to the large scale of construction, the rapid growth of consumption funds, and the implementation of some price reform measures.

He said, "From the experience of the past two years, to transform a highly centralized planned economy into a socialist commodity economy with planning, price reform is inevitable, but the pace cannot be too fast. Even during periods of rapid economic growth, the pace cannot be too fast." He said, "China is a developing country, and modernization and reform will be a long-term process. Development and reform both require a long-term plan."

When discussing China's political system reforms, Li Peng pointed out that China does not practice a multi-party system. China practices a system of cooperation among multiple parties under the leadership of the Communist Party. He said, "Currently, China has 8 democratic parties. We will further enhance their role in participating in and deliberating on state affairs."

Li Peng said, "We will continue to better implement the thought line of seeking truth from facts, determining our policies based on China's actual situation."

The Hungarian guests arrived in Beijing yesterday to participate in the 4th meeting of the China-Hungary Economic, Trade, and Scientific and Technological Cooperation Committee, which opened today. The main agenda of this meeting is to review and evaluate the progress of economic, trade, and scientific and technological cooperation between the two countries since the 3rd meeting, and to discuss new cooperation projects.

Majes Peter told Li Peng, "This morning, both sides had a very good discussion. The prospects for cooperation are optimistic." He said, "Hungary hopes to strengthen cooperation with China in areas such as agriculture, energy, and power."

Li Peng also expressed the hope that the two countries will develop friendly and cooperative relations on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Minister of Agriculture He Kang, Chairman of the Chinese side of the China-Hungary Economic, Trade, and Scientific and Technological Cooperation Committee, was present at the meeting.

　　李鹏会见匈牙利客人时重申    
    我国改革开放方向不变
    新华社北京４月２５日电（记者张荣典）国务院总理李鹏今天在会见匈牙利客人时说，中国虽然遇到了一些暂时的困难，但改革、开放的方向不会改变。
    李鹏今天下午在中南海紫光阁会见了由中国—匈牙利经济、贸易、科技合作委员会匈方主席、匈牙利副总理迈杰什·彼得率领的匈牙利政府代表团。
    李鹏在向客人介绍中国国内情况时说，中国改革、开放１０年来取得了不少成绩，但也遇到了一些问题，如通货膨胀较高。这是由于基建规模过大，消费基金增长过快，另外是由于采取了一些价格改革措施。
    他说，从这两年的经验来看，要使高度集中的计划经济转变为有计划的社会主义商品经济，价格改革非进行不可，但步子不能走得太快，即使是在经济增长较快的时候，步子也不能太快。他说，中国是一个发展中国家，现代化建设和改革都将是一个长期的过程，发展和改革都要有一个长远的计划。
    在谈到中国的政治体制改革时，李鹏指出，中国不搞多党制，中国实行的是共产党领导的多党合作制。他说，“中国现在有８个民主党派。我们要进一步发挥它们在国家事务中的参政、议政作用。”
    李鹏说，“我们将继续更好地贯彻实事求是的思想路线，一切从中国的实际出发来确定自己的政策。”
    匈牙利客人是于昨天抵京参加于今天开幕的中匈经济、贸易、科技合作委员会第４次会议的。这次会议的主要议题是回顾和评价委员会第３次会议以来两国经济、贸易、科技合作进展情况、讨论新的合作项目等。
    迈杰什·彼得对李鹏说，今天上午双方进行了很好的会谈，“合作的前景是乐观的”。他说，匈牙利希望两国加强在农业、动力、能源等方面的合作。
    李鹏也表示希望两国在平等互利的基础上发展友好合作关系。农业部部长、中匈经济、贸易、科技合作委员会中方主席何康会见时在座。
