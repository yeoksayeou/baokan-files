Recently, I returned to Liangshan County in Shandong Province to visit relatives and found that the problem of overpopulation is very serious. It is quite common for a couple to have three or four children. In this area, it seems that the more children you have, the more boys you have, the more glorious it is. If a family does not have a boy, it is as if they are inferior, and the gossip and rumors make the couples without boys unable to hold their heads high. Some village cadres and their children lead the way in overpopulation, losing the trust of the people, and therefore, the village cadres' words are not heeded.

　　村干部带头超生  计划生育难落实
    最近，我回到山东梁山县探亲，发现家乡的超生现象十分严重，一对夫妇生三四胎的很普遍。在这里，似乎谁生得多，谁生男孩，谁就光荣。谁家要是没有男孩，就好像低人一等，闲言碎语压得未生男孩的夫妇抬不起头来。有些村干部和他们的子女带头超生，失信于民，因此，村干部说话没人听。
