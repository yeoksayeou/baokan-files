Such "Savings Competition" Is Not Advisable

Before and after the Spring Festival this year, several banks in our county competed to raise deposit interest rates, engaging in a "rate war." On February 17, the county branch of the Construction Bank decided that for a deposit of 1,000 yuan for one year, in addition to paying interest according to the new rate announced by the People's Bank, an additional bonus would be given. The county branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank was not to be outdone and also launched a new plan: a deposit of 1,111.60 yuan for three years would immediately issue a 2,000 yuan deposit book, and upon maturity, interest would be paid according to the value-preserving deposit rate. Following this, the county branch of the Agricultural Bank decided that a deposit of 1,000 yuan for three years would immediately issue a 1,636 yuan deposit book to the depositor, and upon maturity, interest would be paid according to the value-preserving deposit rate. In a short time, the "rate war" intensified, and despite the county branch of the People's Bank stepping in to stop it, it continued covertly. Deposits moved frequently between the banks, and many depositors carried their deposits from one savings office to another to inquire about interest rates and decide whether to withdraw or deposit. Even more depositors held onto their money, waiting for higher interest rates to be announced. This artificial "rate war" not only has limited effect on attracting deposits but also violates the state's interest rate policy and damages the bank's reputation.

　　如此“储蓄竞争”不可取
    今年春节前后，我县几家银行竞相提高存款利率，大打“利率战”。２月１７日，县建设银行决定，１０００元存一年，除按人民银行公布的新利率支付利息外，另加一定的奖金。县工商银行不甘落后，也推出新方案，１１１１．６０元存３年，当即给储户开２０００元存单，到期还按保值储蓄利率计付利息。接着，县农业银行决定，１０００元存３年，当即开给储户１６３6元存单，到期按保值储蓄利率计付利息。一时间，“利率战”愈演愈烈，虽经县人民银行出面制止，但仍然是明停暗行，存款在几家银行之间你来我往，频繁搬家。不少储户手持存款，到一家家储蓄所打听利率，决定取舍；更多的储户持币等待着更高的利率出台。这种人为的“利率战”，不仅吸收存款有限，而且违犯了国家的利率政策，败坏了银行的声誉。
