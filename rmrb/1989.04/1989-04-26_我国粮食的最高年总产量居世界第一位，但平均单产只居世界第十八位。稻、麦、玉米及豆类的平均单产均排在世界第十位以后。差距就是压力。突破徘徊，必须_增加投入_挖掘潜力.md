From 1979 to 1984, China's total grain production increased from 300 million tons to 400 million tons. The total agricultural output value rose from 12.88 billion yuan in 1978 to 28.15 billion yuan in 1984, an increase of 1.18 times.

Was this rapid growth in agriculture an anomaly or a mere coincidence? The common explanation during those years was "one relies on policy, the other on science," which is certainly correct, but it should be made more specific. The implementation of the household contract responsibility system in rural areas provided agriculture with an internal driving force, which is undoubtedly a crucial factor, but not the only one. Because the widespread implementation of the contract responsibility system occurred after 1982, other growth factors should not be overlooked. First, starting from 1979, the state significantly increased the prices of agricultural products and implemented a policy of additional purchases at higher prices, the more purchased, the more farmers earned; the prices of production materials remained basically stable, reducing the "scissors gap" between industrial and agricultural products and increasing the comparative benefits of agricultural products. Second, the input of chemical fertilizers increased significantly, with the physical quantity rising from 43.68 million tons to 74.95 million tons, and the per-acre usage increasing from 29.3 kilograms to 51.05 kilograms. The growth rate of chemical fertilizer input was higher than that of grain production. The promotion and application of practical scientific technologies, especially the widespread promotion of hybrid rice and hybrid corn, played a significant role in grain production. The material foundation accumulated over the years, such as effective water conservancy facilities and agricultural land construction, also played a role. Although the state's investment in agricultural infrastructure decreased from 10.6% of the total investment to 5%, farmers' investment in productive fixed assets increased from 3 billion yuan in 1982 to 11.3 billion yuan, accounting for 29.9% of the total investment, up from 15.1%. This indicates that farmers had the initiative to invest during this period.

From this, it can be seen that the rapid growth of agriculture during this period was based on input (including material and technology), in line with the general laws of material production. The view that the implementation of the household contract responsibility system is the sole factor for increased production, and that the enthusiasm of farmers can replace the input of other production factors, is one-sided.

After 1985, agriculture faced new situations. Major agricultural products such as grain, cotton, and oil changed from mandatory procurement to contract procurement, marking a significant breakthrough in the reform of the procurement and marketing system. However, due to some inappropriate measures, production was suppressed, leading to stagnation in grain production, a significant drop in cotton production, and fluctuations in pig production. In 1985, the grain sowing area decreased by 60 million mu compared to the previous year, the yield per unit area decreased, and the total production decreased by 6.9%. Grain production has yet to recover to the level of 1984. Cotton production also declined year by year, with a 33.7% drop in 1985 compared to the previous year, and it continues to decline. Analyzing the reasons for this significant fluctuation, it is not difficult to see that it is not a regular phenomenon. The main reason is that the input decreased, the contract procurement price for agricultural products was low, and the price of production materials rose significantly, leading to a significant decrease in the comparative benefits of grain and cotton production, dampening farmers' enthusiasm. As for why this situation occurred, it needs to be analyzed deeply from the perspective of the national economy as a whole, especially the relationship between industry and agriculture. As long as we objectively summarize the experience, learn from the lessons, adopt policies for the coordinated development of industry and agriculture, increase investment, adjust policies, and mobilize the enthusiasm of farmers, it is entirely possible to reverse the stagnant situation.

Looking at the situation of agriculture itself, there is still enormous potential for continued development. The most significant feature of the rapid growth of agriculture from 1979 to 1984 was the increase in yield per unit area. During these five years, the total grain sowing area in the country decreased by 150 million mu, but the yield per mu increased from 169 kilograms to 241 kilograms, with an average annual increase of 12 kilograms. Has this yield per unit area reached its peak and can no longer increase significantly? We can compare it with the average yield per unit area of grain in the world. In 1984, China's total grain production was 407.12 million tons, ranking first in the world, but the yield per hectare ranked 18th in the world. Whether it is rice, wheat, corn, or other grains, or legumes, the yield per unit area is ranked after the 10th in the world. There is a gap, and there is potential. On the other hand, the current quality of cultivated land in our country varies greatly, with few high-yielding fields and 2/3 of the area being medium and low-yielding fields. Most regions are still in traditional agriculture, and the promotion and application of modern agricultural science and technology, from an overall perspective, have just begun, while the role of science and technology in increasing production is about 20-30%, and there is still much potential in this area. We should also see that there is still potential to expand the grain sowing area, one is to expand the multiple cropping index, the current multiple cropping index for grain is 150%, and each increase of one percentage point can increase the sowing area by 15 million mu; the other is that a large amount of resources outside the existing cultivated land have not been developed, and in the process of development, according to the principle of optimizing resource allocation, naturally, the grain area will still increase. In summary, we are optimistic about the prospects for grain production. A pessimistic and do-nothing attitude is neither in line with the facts nor beneficial.

    我国粮食的最高年总产量居世界第一位，但平均单产只居世界第十八位。稻、麦、玉米及豆类的平均单产均排在世界第十位以后。差距就是压力。突破徘徊，必须——
    增加投入　挖掘潜力
    郭书田
    １９７９年至１９８４年，我国粮食总产是由３亿吨增加到４亿吨。农业总产值由１９７８年的１２８８亿元增加到１９８４年的２８１５亿元，增长１．１８倍。
    农业的这种快速增长是不是异常或者是一种偶然现象呢？这几年的习惯说法是“一靠政策二靠科学”，这当然是对的，但还应具体化。农村实行联产承包制，使农业有了内在的动力，无疑是个极为重要的因素，但不是唯一的因素，因为大包干的普遍实行是在１９８２年以后，因而其他增长因素是不应当被忽视的。首先是从１９７９年起国家大幅度提高了农产品价格，并实行超购加价政策，超购越多农民增收也越多；生产资料价格又基本稳定，工农产品“剪刀差”缩小，农产品比较效益上升。其次，化肥投入量大增，实物量由４３６８万吨增加到７４９５万吨，亩用量由２９．３公斤增加到５１．０５公斤，化肥投入的增长率高于粮食增长率。实用科学技术的推广应用，特别是杂交水稻和杂交玉米广泛推广，对粮食增产起了重要作用。多年积累起来的物质基础，如有效的水利设施和农田基本建设等都发挥了作用。在这个时期虽然国家对农业基本建设的投入由占基建投资总额的１０．６％降到５％，但农民用于生产性固定资产的投资却由１９８２年的３０亿元增加到１１３亿元，占投资总额的比重由１５．１％上升到２９．９％。说明这个时期农民有投入的积极性。
    由此可见，该时期农业高速增长是以投入（包括物质和科技）为前提条件的，符合物质生产的一般规律，那种把实行联产承包责任制看作是唯一的增产因素，以为由此调动起来的农民的积极性就可以替代其他生产要素的投入是不全面的。
    １９８５年以后，农业出现了新的情况。粮、棉、油大宗农产品由统购改为合同定购，在购销体制改革上是个重大突破，但由于采取了一些不适当的措施，抑制了生产，致使粮食生产徘徊，棉花大幅度下降，生猪几次波动。１９８５年粮食播种面积比上年减少６０００万亩，单产降低，总产量下降６．９％。粮食生产至今未恢复到１９８４年的水平。棉花也是连年下降，１９８５年竟比上年下降３３．７％，至今仍呈下降趋势。分析这种大幅度波动的原因，不难看出这并不带规律性，主要是因为投入减少，农产品定购价格低，生产资料价格大幅度上升，造成粮棉生产的比较利益显著下降，挫伤了农民的积极性。至于为什么会出现这种情况，需要从国民经济全局，特别是工农业关系上作深层分析。只要我们实事求是地总结经验，吸取教训，采取工农业协调发展的政策，增加投入，调整政策，把农民的积极性调动起来，扭转徘徊局面是完全可能的。
    从农业本身的情况看，继续发展还有巨大的潜力。１９７９年至１９８４年农业快速增长的最大特点是单位面积产量提高。这５年间全国粮食播种面积累计减少１．５亿亩，亩产量却由１６９公斤上升为２４１公斤，平均每年增加１２公斤。这个单产水平是不是已经到顶，不可能再有较大幅度增长了呢？我们不妨与世界粮食单产的平均水平作个比较。１９８４年我国粮食总产４０７１２万吨，居世界第一位，而每公顷产量却居世界第１８位，无论稻谷、小麦、玉米等谷物或豆类的单产均排在世界各国的第１０位以后。有差距，就有潜力。另一方面，目前我国耕地质量水平差距甚大，高产田较少，中低产田面积占２／３。大多数地区仍属传统型农业，现代农业科学技术的推广应用从总体看，还刚刚起步，而科学技术在增产中的作用大体为２０—３０％，这方面的潜力还很大。我们还应看到，扩大粮食播种面积还有潜力，一是扩大复种指数，目前粮食的复种指数为１５０％，每扩大一个百分点，就能增加播种面积１５００万亩；二是现有耕地以外大量的资源尚未开发，在开发过程中，按照优化资源配置的原则，自然还会增加粮食的面积。总之，我们对粮食增产的前景持乐观态度，悲观、无所作为态度既不符合实际，也是有害的。
