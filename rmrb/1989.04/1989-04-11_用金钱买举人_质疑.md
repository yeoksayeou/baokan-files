Title: Questioning the Idea of "Buying Scholars with Money"

The March 23rd edition of the People's Daily, in the "Random Notes from the Land" column, published an article titled "Let's Not Discuss the 'Celebrities'." This piece sharply criticizes social ills with good intentions and resonates deeply. However, one sentence in the article states: "In the past feudal society, wealthy individuals could buy the title of scholar and purchase official positions with money," which I cannot agree with.

Chinese feudal society lasted over two thousand years. The term "scholar" (举人) in the Tang Dynasty was a general term for those who went to the capital to take the imperial examinations. In the Ming and Qing Dynasties, it specifically referred to those who passed the provincial examinations. In the novel "The Scholars," there is a record of "Fan Jin's success in the examinations," which is an example of this. The author uses the entire lengthy feudal society to refer to specific dynasties, which is not rigorous and lacks accuracy. This is the first point.

"Donation and Purchase" (捐纳), which refers to buying official positions with money, was indeed a common method used by the Chinese feudal government to raise funds. From the Qin and Han Dynasties to the late Qing Dynasty, money could be used to buy titles, official positions, and the status of a "student" (监生) in the Ming and Qing Dynasties. However, scholars were those who passed the examinations, not those who bought their titles. The statement "buying the title of scholar with money" is not supported by historical evidence. As for wealthy and influential individuals cheating in the examination halls, hiring "ghostwriters" to write essays and deceiving their way to official positions, such incidents did occur throughout history. But this is a different category and should not be confused with "buying the title of scholar with money." This is the second point.

　　“用金钱买举人”质疑
　　丰之
    三月二十三日《人民日报》八版“大地漫笔”栏《“名流”别议》一文，针砭时弊，用心良苦，深有同感。惟其中一句：“以前封建社会有钱的人可以用金钱买举人的牌子、买官做”，令人不敢苟同。
    中国封建社会历时逾两千年。而举人一词，在唐代乃泛指进京应试的人；在明清两代则为乡试考中者的专称，《儒林外史》中记“范进中举”一节，即其一例。作者以漫长的封建社会来替代特定的某一两个朝代，颇不严谨，也欠准确。此其一。
    “捐纳”，即拿钱买官做，确是中国封建政府常用的聚敛之术。自秦汉以迄晚清，用钱可以捐爵、捐官、捐监（明清两代出资报捐可取得“监生”资格）。但举人是考中而不是捐来的，“用钱买举人的牌子”，于史无据。至于有钱有势的人在考场作弊，花钱请“枪手”代作文章而骗取功名的事，历代都有，但这是另一个范畴，与“用钱买举人牌子”有别。此其二。
