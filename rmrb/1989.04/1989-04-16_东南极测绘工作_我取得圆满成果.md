	China's surveying and mapping team, which participated in the country's first expedition to the Southeast Antarctic, has successfully completed the topographical mapping of the Chinese Antarctic Station. This achievement is of great significance for understanding the Antarctic and facilitating future Antarctic expeditions.

	On December 25, 1988, Du Dongchen and Xu Shaojun from Wuhan Technical University of Surveying and Mapping boarded a helicopter and were the first to land on the Southeast Antarctic continent. Over the course of 64 days, they completed six surveying and scientific research tasks. At the Longling Beach benchmark, they used a satellite receiver to observe the passage of the satellite 58 times, accurately determining the geographical coordinates of Zhongshan Station as 69 degrees 22 minutes 24 seconds south latitude and 76 degrees 22 minutes 40 seconds east longitude. Using astronomical measurements and gyroscopic orientation, they established the meridian direction of the station area, measured the distance from Zhongshan Station to Beijing as 12,553.160 kilometers, and determined the azimuth angle to be 32 degrees 30 minutes 50 seconds.

　　东南极测绘工作　我取得圆满成果
    据新华社青岛四月十五日电　（记者张荣大）参加我国首次赴东南极考察的测绘科技人员，已经圆满完成了中国南极站地形图的测绘。这对认识南极和方便今后南极考察具有十分重要的作用。
    一九八八年十二月二十五日，武汉测绘科技大学的鄂栋臣、徐绍铨乘直升机首批登上东南极大陆，登陆后的六十四天中，他们先后完成了六项测绘和科学考察任务。在卧龙滩测绘基准点上用卫星接收机观测子午仪卫星五十八次有效通过，测定出中山站的精确地理位置为南纬六十九度二十二分二十四秒，东经七十六度二十二分四十秒。用天文测量和陀螺定向确定出站区子午线方向，测定出中山站到北京的距离为一万二千五百五十三点一六○公里，其方位角为三十二度三十分五十秒。
