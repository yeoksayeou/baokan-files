Exorbitant dowries have become a public nuisance. In my county, arranged and bought marriages are rampant. In 1981, the dowry for a rural youth to marry a wife was about 1,000 yuan. By 1987, the dowry had risen to about 4,500 yuan. Now, marrying a wife without at least 10,000 yuan is almost impossible. The speed at which dowries have increased is astonishing, adding a heavy burden to many farmers who have just escaped poverty. They sigh, saying, "Marrying a wife means taking on debt, and it will take at least 10 years to pay it off."

Exorbitant dowries have caused some parents, who are greedy for money, to treat their own children as "commodities" for sale, completely disregarding their daughters' feelings. Many families, in order to marry off a daughter, have to sell their property, take out high-interest loans, and even drive some young people to commit crimes. This trend of arranged and bought marriages has led to the prevalence of "child betrothals," causing many families to be unhappy and affecting social stability. For example, in my county's Xuecha Village, there are only about 10 households, but a few years ago, 13 children aged 2 to 14 were betrothed, with dowries ranging from 2,500 to 3,000 yuan. In 1981, a 14-year-old girl named Chen Guangfen from Wugucheng Township was still in school when her parents received a high dowry and betrothed her to a young man from Jingbian County. When she was 17, the man used backdoor methods to obtain a marriage certificate. On her wedding day, Chen Guangfen cried to the heavens, but her family forcibly tied her to a cart and sent her to the groom's house. After the marriage, she was often beaten, once so severely that she was hospitalized for half a month and had her fingers broken. She ran back to her parents' home, but they drove her away. Poor Guangfen had no choice but to repeatedly go to the township government to request a divorce. Finally, with the help of the county Women's Federation, she was able to end her painful marriage.

Now, in my county, not only do rural women demand dowries, but urban girls are also increasing their dowry prices. I hope the government will take measures to stop arranged and bought marriages.

### 高额彩礼已成公害

　　高额彩礼已成公害
    我县包办、买卖婚姻泛滥成灾。１９８１年时，农村青年娶一个媳妇的彩礼约１０００元，１９８７年，彩礼涨到约４５００元。现在，娶一个媳妇没有１万元怕是不行了。“彩礼”上升速度如此惊人，给众多刚摆脱贫困的农民又增加了沉重的负担。他们叹息说：“娶个媳妇欠下债，没有１０年还不完。”
    高额彩礼，使一些见钱眼开的父母把自己亲生骨肉当成“商品”任意买卖，根本不管女儿的感情。有不少家庭为娶个媳妇，不得不变卖家产，借高利贷，甚至逼得一些青年走上犯罪道路。这种包办、买卖婚姻的发展趋势，促使了“娃娃亲”盛行，由此造成许多家庭不和，影响社会安定。例如，我县薛岔乡雷坡村只有１０多户人家，可前几年就有１３名２至１４岁的娃娃订了亲，彩礼２５００元至３０００元。１９８１年，五谷城乡１４岁的女孩子陈光芬正在上学时，父母收取了高额彩礼，给她和靖边县一个青年订了婚。她１７岁那年，男方走后门领了结婚证。出嫁那天，陈光芬哭天喊地，可家里人强行把她绑在架子车上送到男家。过门后，她经常遭到毒打，有一次被打得住了半个月医院，手指也被打折了。她跑回娘家，娘家又把她赶出去。可怜的光芬只好一趟趟去乡政府要求离婚。最后，在县妇联的帮助下，才解除了她痛苦的婚姻。
    在我县，如今不仅农村女子要彩礼，城镇姑娘的彩礼要价也越来越高。希望政府采取措施，制止包办、买卖婚姻。
