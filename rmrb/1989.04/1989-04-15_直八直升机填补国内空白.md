The Zhi-8 transport helicopter, independently developed by China, recently passed the appraisal in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi Province, and was handed over for use. It fills the gap in the production of large helicopters in China.

By the end of this century, helicopters will have a wide range of applications in national economic construction. Currently, both domestic and international light helicopters have a broad market, and the faster they develop, the more benefits and market share they will gain.

In response to the development of helicopters and the current national situation, Vice Minister of the Aerospace Industry Department He Wentian emphasized that we cannot rely on purchasing from abroad to develop the helicopter industry. Currently, we must first digest the imported mature technology and accelerate the research and development of domestically produced helicopters.

    到本世纪末，直升机在国民经济建设中有着广泛的用途。目前，国内国外轻型直升机都有广播的市场，发展得越快，越有效益和市场。
    针对直升机发展和国情现状，航空航天部副部长何文治强调不能依靠向国外购买，来发展直升机事业。目前，首先要消化引进成熟的技术并加快国产化研究。
