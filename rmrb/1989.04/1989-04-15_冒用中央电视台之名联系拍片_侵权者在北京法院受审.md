Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 13th.

A case involving the infringement of the name rights of China Central Television (CCTV) was concluded on April 12 by the Beijing Intermediate People's Court. The defendants, the Industrial Department of the China Peace Company and the Beijing Youth Audio-Visual Publishing House, were found liable for civil damages. They were ordered to compensate CCTV for economic losses and to issue a public apology to the plaintiff.

This case of name rights infringement was filed by CCTV last November based on public reports. The investigation revealed that in August of last year, the Industrial Department of the China Peace Company and the Beijing Youth Audio-Visual Publishing House signed an agreement to jointly produce a 30-episode television series titled "The Rise of China's Coastal Economy." They also formed a production team. During their activities in Tianjin, including filming and accommodation arrangements, the production team falsely used CCTV's name. Members of the production team also printed and used business cards bearing CCTV's name. To raise funds, they used CCTV's name to solicit donations from various units and factories in Tianjin, promising that the program would be broadcast on CCTV by October 1. The 24,000 yuan they raised was transferred to the account of the Industrial Department of the China Peace Company.

At a press conference held this morning, CCTV President Huang Huiguan stated that impersonating CCTV to deceive the public occurs several times a year. In the future, CCTV will take legal action against similar incidents. She urged all units to be vigilant and guard against being deceived. Deputy President Ding Guanghua added that infringement cases have been occurring frequently in recent years.

　　冒用中央电视台之名联系拍片
　　侵权者在北京法院受审
    据新华社北京４月１３日电　一宗侵害中央电视台名称权案件１２日已由北京市中级人民法院审理终结。被告中国和平公司工业部、北京市青少年音像出版社承担民事责任，赔偿中央电视台经济损失，并向原告中央电视台赔礼道歉。
    这起侵害名称权案件是中央电视台去年１１月根据群众举报向法院起诉的。经查，去年８月，被告中国和平公司工业部与北京市青少年音像出版社签订双方联合摄制３０集电视专题片《中国沿海经济的腾飞》的协议，并共同组建了摄制组。这个摄制组在天津联系拍片、住宿等活动中，冒用中央电视台名义。摄制组成员还印制并使用了带有中央电视台字样的名片。为了集资，他们还打着中央电视台的牌子，在天津一些单位、厂家集资，并许诺节目拍成后于１０月１日前在中央电视台播出。他们集资的２４０００多元已转入中国和平公司工业部账号中。
    中央电视台台长黄惠群在今天上午举行的记者招待会上说，盗用中央电视台名义，在社会上招摇撞骗的事，每年都发生几起。今后再发生类似事件，中央电视台都交诉诸法律。她提请各单位提高警惕，谨防上当。副台长丁广华说，近年来，侵权案件时有发生。
