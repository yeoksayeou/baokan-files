Title: Exposure Alone Is Not Enough

The term "exposure" has appeared more and more frequently in newspapers over the past two years. For example, "Exposure of the Case of Departmental Officials Using Special Vehicles to Smuggle Cigarettes," "Exposure of a Major Case of Officials Selling State Assets," "Exposure of Provincial Officials' Overseas Travel on Public Expenses," and so on. It almost feels like one can't keep up with all the exposures. However, after the initial excitement, many people wonder: is everything over just because something has been "exposed"?

It is heartening that many exposures have led to follow-up actions. However, some have not. Indeed, compared to the past when everything was covered up and kept secret, "exposure" represents a significant advancement in public supervision. But people have heard too many times the phrase "let this be the last time." Exposure is not the goal. If, after exposure, things return to normal—private photos are taken, guests are entertained, officials continue to engage in corrupt practices, and everything remains the same—then various ugly phenomena will only worsen, and the public will gradually lose hope. What meaning would such "exposure" have?

Therefore, it is clear that while "exposure" is important, handling the situation after exposure is even more urgent. Because after exposure, many people are still waiting for the "result"—the handling of the case!

### 仅有“曝光”是不够的

　　仅有“曝光”是不够的
　　黄斌
    “曝光”一词，近两年报纸上出现越来越多了。如：“部令专车走私香烟案曝光”，“特大官倒汽车案曝光”，“某省某厅领导干部公费出国旅游曝光”等等，令人简直有目不霞接之感。然而，不少人兴奋之余心中也在嘀咕：“曝光”之后是不是就完事大吉了呢？
    令人欣尉的是，许多“曝光”有了下文，但是，也有一些没有下文。诚然，与早先的凡事捂着盖着讳莫如深相比，“曝光”实为舆论监督的一大进步。但类似“下不为例”的话人们已听得太多，“曝光”也毕竟不是目的。倘若“曝光”之后，私照走，客照请，官照“倒”，一切照旧，到头来各类丑恶现象反而变本加厉地复制出来，民众岂不要逐渐失望？这种“曝光”还有什么意义？
    由是可知，“曝光”固然重要，“曝光”之后的处理尤为迫切。因为“曝光”之后，还有众多的人在期待着“成相”——拿出处理结果呢！
