Formerly, they built the Great Northern Wilderness; today, they take up their pens to recall the past.

	Former knowledge youth who toiled in the Great Northern Wilderness of the Heilongjiang Production and Construction Corps are now writing "Chronicles of the Great Northern Wilderness."

	The Heilongjiang Production and Construction Corps was established 20 years ago. Tens of thousands of knowledge youth from Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Heilongjiang, Zhejiang, and other provinces and cities spent their youth there in arduous struggle, leaving behind indelible footprints of their youth. Today, they are scattered across the country, continuing to make silent contributions to the modernization of the nation on various fronts.

	Writers such as Liang Xiaosheng, known for his works "Tonight There Will Be a Storm" and "Snow City," and young notable figures such as Jiang Kun, Shi Xiaoyan, Zhao Yan, Jia Hongtu, Zhang Daqian, and Jiang Wei believe that at present, we need a work that records the spirit of ordinary people from the Great Northern Wilderness, so that the indomitable spirit of struggle of the people of the Great Northern Wilderness can be passed down.

	"The Chronicles of the Great Northern Wilderness" will compile the most unforgettable experiences of individual soldiers from the corps, requiring the content to be true and specific, aiming to reflect and illuminate the life of the corps and a side of that era. The submissions can take various forms such as reportage, feature articles, and memoirs.

	Simultaneously published with "The Chronicles of the Great Northern Wilderness" is "The Directory of People from the Great Northern Wilderness." These two books will be published by the China Youth and Children's Press.

　　当年创业北大荒　今日提笔忆往昔
    新华社北京４月１６日电　当年在北大荒黑龙江生产建设兵团艰苦创业的知识青年提笔撰写《北大荒风云录》。
    黑龙江生产建设兵团是２０年前组建的，北京、天津、上海、黑龙江、浙江等省、市的数十万知识青年在那里渡过了艰苦创业的悲壮岁月，留下了他们永生难忘的青春足迹。今天，他们遍布全国各地，在各条战线继续为国家的现代化事业作出默默的奉献。
    以创作《今夜有暴风雨》、《雪城》闻名全国的作家梁晓声和青年知名人士姜昆、石肖岩、赵炎、贾宏图、张大千、蒋巍等认为，当前，我们需要一本记载普通北大荒人精神风貌的作品，使北大荒人艰苦奋斗的不朽精神能流传下去。
    《北大荒风云录》将辑录兵团战士个人在兵团经历的最难忘的一件事，要求内容真实、具体，以能反映和折射兵团生活和那个时代的一个侧面为宗旨。稿件可采用报告文学、特写、回忆录等多种形式。
    与《北大荒风云录》同时出版的还有《北大荒人名录》。这两本书将由中国青少年图书读物总公司发行。
