A Cunning Opponent That Needs to Be Handled with Caution

	The People's Daily published an article on April 10th evaluating the Vietnamese government's April 5th withdrawal announcement. While reading the Vietnamese statement, the author found that the manner in which this announcement was made and the carefully crafted arguments presented are quite unusual. The more one examines it, the more one realizes that the Vietnamese government is a cunning opponent that the international community needs to handle with caution.

	This announcement was made in the form of a joint statement by Vietnam, Laos, and the Phnom Penh regime, creating the effect that anyone who accepts the Vietnamese withdrawal by the end of September based on this joint statement would simultaneously recognize the Phnom Penh puppet regime as a legitimate government, just as Vietnam and Laos are. The Vietnamese government has previously attempted to legalize its Phnom Penh puppet regime through various means but has not succeeded. Now, it is trying to use the international community's expectation of Vietnam's withdrawal by the end of September to induce recognition of the Phnom Penh regime. This can only indicate that the Vietnamese government is still attempting to force the international community to acknowledge the fait accompli of its aggression.

	The conditions attached to the Vietnamese government's withdrawal commitment are to stop "all foreign interference and all military aid" in the "internal war" of Cambodia. This wording attempts to portray the Cambodian issue as an "internal war" between the Phnom Penh regime and the various opposition forces, thereby exonerating the Vietnamese government of its aggressor status. Meanwhile, supporting the Cambodian people's resistance to Vietnamese aggression is framed as "interference" in Cambodia's internal affairs. This confusing of right and wrong fully demonstrates that the Vietnamese government has no intention of repenting its crimes and only wants to use empty promises of withdrawal to deceive international public opinion.

	The most laughable part of the Vietnamese government's withdrawal commitment is that it volunteers to act as an arbitrator, specifying the members of the international supervision body. An aggressor specifying the international supervision body for the withdrawal of its invading troops is an unprecedented "innovation" in international relations. Proposing such a suggestion is merely an attempt to portray itself as a third party. This cover-up only proves that the Vietnamese government's so-called "withdrawal" hides many unspeakable secrets, and therefore it does not dare to let the United Nations peacekeeping forces represent the international community to supervise the withdrawal.

	The Vietnamese government's invasion of Cambodia for ten years has been futile. Under domestic and international pressure, it has no choice but to agree to withdraw. At the same time, it hopes to save face, which is understandable. However, to save face, it must withdraw unconditionally and completely to change its international image. The Soviet Union's unconditional and complete withdrawal from Afghanistan received a good international response, which is an example. Since invading Cambodia, the Vietnamese government has shown a strong medieval diplomatic style in its diplomatic manner. This is not feasible in contemporary international politics and international relations. If it continues to think it has succeeded and uses cunning tactics to deceive the international community, it will only lose more face.

　　需要小心对付的对手
　　塞北
    本报10日发表的《国际瞭望》对越南当局4月5日的撤军声明作出了评价。笔者在通览越方声明时发现这次宣布所采取的方式及其煞费苦心提出的一些论点颇不一般，其中文章值得细细玩味。愈看愈觉得越南当局是国际社会需要小心对付的一个诡诈的对手。
    这次宣布是以越南、老挝、金边政权联合声明的方式发表的，这就造成了这样一个效果：谁要是以联合声明为基础接受越南9月底以前撤军这个诱饵，他就同时承认了金边傀儡同越南、老挝政府一样是一个合法的政府。越南当局曾经企图用各种办法使它的金边傀儡合法化而未能成功，现在又妄图利用国际社会对越南9月底以前撤军的期待，诱使人们承认金边政权。这只能说明越南当局至今仍然企图迫使国际社会承认侵略所造成的既成事实。
    越南当局这个撤军承诺所附的条件是停止对柬埔寨“内战”的“一切外国干涉和一切军事援助”。这种措词企图把柬埔寨问题说成是金边政权同反对它的各派力量之间的“内战”，为越南当局洗刷侵略者的罪名，而支持柬埔寨人民抵抗越南侵略则反成了对柬埔寨内政的“干涉”。这种混淆黑白的说法充分表明越南当局至今毫无悔祸之心，只想用关于撤军的空口承诺来搪塞国际舆论。
    越南当局撤军承诺中最可笑的是，它居然毛遂自荐当起仲裁者，由它来指定国际监督机构成员。侵略者来指定撤走侵略军的国际监督机构，这可谓是国际关系史上罕有的“创举”。提出这种主张无非是想把自己装扮成第三者，这种欲盖弥彰的手法反而证明越南当局的所谓“撤军”中掩藏着许多不可告人的名堂，因而它不敢让联合国维持和平部队代表国际社会对撤军进行监督。
    越南当局侵柬十年，徒劳无功，在国内外压力下不得不同意撤军。与此同时，它希望保留一点面子，这可以理解。但是要保留面子，只有无条件全部撤军以改变自己的国际形象。苏联从阿富汗无条件全部撤军在国际上获得良好反应，就是例子。从入侵柬埔寨以来，越南当局在外交作风上表现出浓厚的中世纪外交的色彩。这在当代国际政治和国际关系中是行不通的。如果它继续自以为得计，用诡诈手段欺弄国际社会，那就只能更丢面子。
