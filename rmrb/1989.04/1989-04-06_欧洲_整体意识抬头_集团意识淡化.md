For many years, the fundamental structure of Europe has remained unchanged: Europe and Germany are both divided into two parts, with NATO and the Warsaw Pact directly confronting each other. However, within this apparent stability, significant changes have occurred. Currently, against the backdrop of a new period of détente in East-West relations, Europe is experiencing subtle yet profound shifts, particularly in the dynamics between the two blocs. Not only has the level of nuclear confrontation between the two sides been significantly reduced with the implementation of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, but more importantly, the demarcation lines between the blocs are no longer as clear-cut as before. The trend of mutual rapprochement between the two parts of Europe and the two parts of Germany across the bloc boundaries has intensified, while internal relations within the two blocs are gradually loosening. In short, the "Yalta system" of U.S.-Soviet division of Europe and the antagonism between the blocs are giving way to a rising European collective consciousness, with bloc mentality fading, and the European situation is incubating some structural changes.

Europe is an ancient continent where political, economic, and cultural ties between European countries have deep historical roots. During the Cold War, bloc mentality overshadowed European collective consciousness, but the latter never disappeared. As early as 1959, de Gaulle proposed the idea of a "Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals," which was the first time a European politician broke through the existing framework of Europe and considered the future of Europe from a pan-European perspective. At that time, this idea faced various criticisms, but today, Gorbachev's proposal of a "Common European House" has been welcomed on both sides of the European divide, indicating that European collective consciousness has resonated widely in both parts of Europe.

Of course, the "Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals" and the "Common European House" have different starting points and connotations. De Gaulle's vision was based on the West, envisioning the reunification of Europe on the premise that the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries would evolve towards the West. Gorbachev's vision, on the other hand, is based on the East and is an important component of the Soviet Union's global strategy. The goal of the "Common European House" is not the immediate reunification of Europe but to ease the consequences of European division and bloc confrontation on the basis of maintaining the status quo, replacing confrontation with coexistence, achieving political peace, reducing military confrontation, promoting economic mutual benefit, and enhancing cultural exchange to maintain long-term peace and stability in Europe. Some Western European leaders have expressed their principled agreement with the idea of the "Common European House." West German Foreign Minister Genscher said he was willing to "work with the Soviet Union to make Europe a true common house." French President Mitterrand praised the "Common European House" as a "good idea" and expressed his willingness to "furnish each floor of the house." However, Western Europe's agreement is more about the space of the house, while the structure and furnishings of each floor have different ideas from the Soviet Union. The general approach is similar to de Gaulle's: strengthening Western Europe's independence, expanding East-West European exchanges, and freeing East and West Europe from U.S.-Soviet control to ultimately end the U.S.-Soviet division of Europe under the "Yalta system." Despite various disagreements, the active discussions between East and West around the "Common European House" indicate that European collective consciousness is strengthening, and bloc mentality is fading.

The ideas of a "Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals" and a "Common European House" are ultimately long-term goals, and the reunification of Europe is not an easy task. The more practical manifestation of European collective consciousness is the strengthening of the trend of East-West rapprochement.

In the context of East-West détente, Soviet and Eastern European reforms, and the Soviet Union's adjustment of its policy towards Eastern Europe, East-West rapprochement has entered a new stage. East and West Europe are not only transforming their relations from bloc-to-bloc to bilateral exchanges between countries but are also developing direct links between Eastern European countries and Western European economic and political organizations. Last June, the European Community and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) established formal relations, paving the way for Eastern European countries to establish individual links and exchanges with the European Community. Some Eastern European countries are interested in Western Europe's high-tech cooperation "Eureka" program; some want to participate in certain activities of the "European Committee" of 21 Western European countries, and some even hope to participate in the process of Western European economic integration. This trend of breaking through bloc frameworks and developing links and cooperation will have a profound impact on the European situation.

The objective basis for East-West rapprochement is the common interests and needs that transcend social systems and bloc confrontations. Europe is the site of fierce political, military, and ideological confrontations between East and West, and it is also the region with the densest concentration of nuclear weapons and conventional arms in the world. Maintaining peace and détente in Europe is in the common security interests of East and West Europe; East and West Europe are economically complementary, and there is a common need for the development of mutually beneficial economic and technological cooperation; East and West Europe both hope to enhance their independent status within their respective blocs, exerting a certain restraint and influence on the United States and the Soviet Union, and safeguarding their national interests. The rapprochement between East and West Germany also has a national factor.

East-West rapprochement also has its own calculations. The basic point of Western Europe's Eastern policy is to promote change through rapprochement, weaken Soviet influence, and make Eastern Europe a kind of buffer zone between it and the Soviet Union to improve its strategic position. Its approach is relatively cautious, adopting a policy of gradual progress, not hoping to provoke a strong reaction from the Soviet Union or suddenly break the political balance in Europe. Eastern Europe mainly aims to create a relaxed external environment for domestic reforms through opening up to Western Europe, treating Western Europe as a key region for introducing funds and technology, and facilitating economic development and political independence. There are contradictions and struggles here. But fundamentally, East-West rapprochement mainly reflects the tendency of East and West European countries to break free from the constraints of the bipolar structure and take control of their own destinies. It is also an important aspect of the trend towards a multipolar world and an irreversible historical trend. However, the development of East-West relations still cannot escape the constraints of U.S.-Soviet competition and the opposition of the two blocs, and Europe itself still has a very sensitive problem—the German question. The United States, the Soviet Union, and many countries in East and West Europe both hope for and fear the rapprochement between East and West Germany.

From the perspective of development trends, the basic structure of Europe being divided into two parts and the confrontation between the two major political and military blocs of NATO and the Warsaw Pact will remain for a considerable period. However, bloc mentality will further fade, internal fissures within the blocs will deepen, and centrifugal tendencies will further develop, weakening the ability of the United States and the Soviet Union to influence European situations and control their respective allies. The strengthening of European collective consciousness and the momentum of East-West rapprochement are challenging the post-war European structure, and the European situation is at the beginning of significant changes.

### 欧洲  整体意识抬头　集团意识淡化

　　欧洲  整体意识抬头　集团意识淡化
　　季寅
    多年来，欧洲的基本格局没有变，这就是：欧洲和德国都一分为二，北约、华约两大军事政治集团直接对峙。但不变中又有变。当前，在东西方关系正进入一个新缓和时期的背景下，欧洲局势出现了似乎并不十分显眼、却是相当深刻的变动，集中表现在两大集团对峙态势的新变化：不仅双方核对峙水平随着中导条约的实施而显著降低，更重要的是集团对立界线不像过去那样泾渭分明了，欧洲两部分、德国两部分超越集团界线相互接近的趋势加强，两大集团内部关系则逐步走向松弛。一言以蔽之，作为美苏分治欧洲的“雅尔塔格局”和集团政治的对立物的欧洲整体意识正在抬头，集团意识趋于淡化，欧洲局势孕育着某种结构性的变化。
    欧洲是一个古老的大陆，欧洲国家之间的政治、经济、文化联系源远流长。在冷战时期，集团意识压倒了欧洲整体意识，但欧洲整体意识并未泯没。戴高乐早在１９５９年就提出了“从大西洋到乌拉尔的欧洲”的构想，这是战后历史上第一次有一个欧洲政治家突破欧洲现存格局的框框，从全欧洲的角度来思考欧洲的前途。当时这一设想遭到种种非议，而今戈尔巴乔夫提出“全欧大厦”的构想，却受到欧洲分界线两边的欢迎，足见欧洲整体意识已在欧洲两部分引起广泛的共鸣。
    当然，“从大西洋到乌拉尔的欧洲”与“全欧大厦”的出发点和内涵是有所不同的。戴高乐的构想立足于西方，把欧洲重新融合一体的前景建立在苏联、东欧国家会向西方演变的设想之上。戈尔巴乔夫的构想则立足于东方，是苏联全球战略的一个重要组成部分。“全欧大厦”的目标还不是欧洲重新融合一体，而是在保持现状的基础上缓解欧洲分治和集团对立的后果，以合作共处取代对抗共处，即政治上和平共处，军事上降低对抗，经济上互利合作，文化上互相交流，以保持欧洲的长期和平与稳定。一些西欧国家领导人表示原则上赞同“全欧大厦”的想法。西德外长根舍表示愿意“同苏联一起为使欧洲成为真正的共同大厦而努力”。法国总统密特朗赞许“全欧大厦”是个“好主意”，表示“愿为大厦的每层布置家具”。不过，西欧所赞同的是大厦的空间，对大厦的结构和每层的陈设布置则有着不同于苏联的想法。总的思路类似戴高乐：增强西欧的独立性，扩大东西欧交往，东西欧摆脱美苏控制，以期最终结束美苏分治欧洲的“雅尔塔格局”。尽管存在这样那样的分歧，东西方围绕“全欧大厦”的积极议论还是说明一个问题：欧洲整体意识在加强，集团意识在淡化。
    “从大西洋到乌拉尔的欧洲”和“全欧大厦”这些对欧洲前途的构想，毕竟还是长远的目标，欧洲重新合二为一决非轻而易举的。欧洲整体意识更为现实的表现在于东西欧接近趋势的加强。
    在东西方关系缓和、苏联东欧改革和苏联调整对东欧政策的形势下，东西欧接近正进入一个新阶段。东西欧不仅变集团对集团的关系为国与国之间的双边交往，而且进而发展到东欧国家同西欧的多边经济、政治组织直接挂钩的地步。去年６月欧共体和经互会建立正式关系，为东欧国家分别同欧共体建立联系和交往铺平了道路。有的东欧国家对西欧高科技合作的“尤里卡”计划感兴趣；有的要求参加西欧２１国“欧洲委员会”的某些活动，有的甚至希望参与西欧经济一体化进程。这种打破集团框框的联系和合作发展的趋势将对欧洲局势产生深远的影响。
    东西欧接近的客观基础是超越社会制度和集团对峙的共同利益和共同需要。欧洲是东西方在政治、军事、意识形态等方面激烈对抗的场所，也是世界上核武器和常规军备最密集的地区，保持欧洲的和平与缓和是东西欧的共同安全利益所在；东西欧经济上互相补充，对发展互利的经贸技术合作有着共同需要；东西欧都希望谋求在各自集团范围内增强独立地位，对美苏起一定的牵制和影响作用，维护自身的民族利益。东西德接近还有民族问题的因素。
    东西欧相互接近也是各有打算的。西欧的东方政策的基本点是以接近促演变，削弱苏联影响，使东欧成为它与苏联之间的某种缓冲地区，以改善自己的战略处境。其做法比较谨慎，采取细水长流的方针，不希望引起苏联的激烈反应或突然打破欧洲的政治平衡。东欧主要着眼于通过向西欧开放为国内改革创造宽松的外部条件，把西欧作为引进资金和技术的重点地区，以利发展经济和增强政治上的独立自主。这里就有矛盾，有斗争。但从根本上说，东西欧接近主要反映了东西欧国家谋求冲破两极格局的羁绊和掌握自己命运的倾向，也是世界多极化的一个重要侧面，是不可逆转的历史趋势。然而，东西欧关系的发展进程还不能不受美苏争夺和两大集团对立的制约，而且欧洲本身还有一个十分敏感的难题——德国问题，美国苏联和东西欧很多国家既希望东西德接近，又不希望它们过于接近。
    从发展趋势看，欧洲一分为二、北约和华约两大政治军事集团对峙的基本格局还将保持相当长的时期，但集团意识将进一步趋于淡化，集团内部的裂痕加深、离心倾向进一步发展，美苏影响欧洲局势和控制各自盟国的能力将更加削弱。欧洲整体意识的加强和东西欧接近的势头向着战后欧洲格局提出挑战，欧洲形势正处在重大变化的开端。
