Individual household operators have contributed to the economic vitality. However, in recent years, some individual household operators have developed improper business practices and methods, which have caused consumer dissatisfaction. Some overseas publications have sharply criticized certain individuals for conducting business with a "hooligan mentality." Here are some of their "sayings" to glimpse their mindset. The rectification and cleanup must not overlook this aspect.

* * *

A certain individual household operator in Beijing: "I operate, if the profit margin is less than fifty percent, I won't do it. I don't care about 'repeat customers'; I'll just rip them off once and that's it. With so many transient people, I'm not worried about not having customers."

* * *

A certain individual household operator in Shijiazhuang: "I welcome the buying frenzy. Once the buying frenzy starts, not only will new fashion clothing be sold out, but even old stock that has been sitting for a long time will be snatched up. We can raise prices during the frenzy. To be honest, if there were more buying frenzies, I would make a fortune."

* * *

Several individual household operators in a southern city discussed "business strategies": "Nowadays, there are so many taxes, how can you make big money without evading taxes?" "Sometimes you can make a small donation to gain goodwill, and then they won't inspect you as strictly, and your reputation will be better." "Give the tax collectors a little 'tip,' and you can reduce the tax you need to pay by half, or even more. Whether you pay more or less, it's up to them." "Yes, it's a win-win situation, why not do it?"

* * *

A certain individual household operator: "In one place, operating one business, you can't stay too long. At the beginning, you want a good reputation, but after making money, you should quit while you're ahead. Even if they investigate later, it will be hard for them to find anything, and I'll move on to something else. This is called 'shoot and scoot.'"

* * *

A certain individual household operator: "You ask about my business methods, actually, the key is just one sentence: use money to pave the way at every step."

* * *

A certain individual household operator took his "wife" to buy front-row seats to watch the opera "La Traviata," but ended up falling asleep. Someone wondered why he spent so much money to sleep. He said: "The important thing is not whether you watch or not, but whether you buy or not. The more expensive, the more I buy, proving my status."

### 个体户“语录”

　　个体户“语录”
    个体户为搞活经济作了贡献。但近年来，一些个体户的不正当的经营作风和方法有所滋长，引起消费者的不满。海外有的报刊尖锐地批评某些人是以“流氓意识”经商。现集纳这些人的几条“语录”，以窥其心态。治理整顿不可忽视这一块。
                      ＊＊
    北京某个体户：“我经营，利润率少百分之五十我不干。我就不要什么
  ‘回头客’，坑他一头就行了。这么多流动人口，我还愁没人到我这儿来？”
                        ＊＊
    石家庄某个体户：“我欢迎抢购风。抢购风一出现，不要说新潮服装，就连无人问津的积压很长时间的陈货，也一抢而光。抢，我们正好抬价。说真的，多来几次抢购风，我就发大财了。”
                        ＊＊
    南方某城市几个个体户切磋“经营之道”：“如今税收很多，不偷税漏税怎么能赚大钱？”“有的时候可以捐一点儿，换取人家的好感，对你查得就松点儿，名声也好点儿。”
  “给收税的人一点‘意思’，你该交的税可以减掉一半，甚至更多。交多交少，他说了算。”“是呵，两全其美，何乐而不为？”
                      ＊＊
    某个体户：“在一个地方，经营一种行当，时间不可太长。开始要让名声不错，等赚了钱，要见好就收，再查也不好查了，我转干别的了。这叫‘打一枪，换一个地方’。”
                      ＊＊
    某个体户：“你问我的经营办法，其实最要害的只有一句话：在各个环节，用钱开路。”
        ＊＊
    某个体户携“夫人”买头排座看歌剧《茶花女》，结果睡着了。有人不解为什么花高价买票去睡觉。他说：“重要的不是看不看，而是买不买。越贵我越买，证明我的身份。”
