In the evening of March 29, I received the sad news of Comrade Xiao Jingguang's passing. I was overwhelmed with grief, deeply regretting the loss of an outstanding leader for our country and the military.

I first met Comrade Jingguang in 1927 during his second visit to the Soviet Union for studies. At that time, I was studying at the Sun Yat-sen University in Moscow, while he was learning military science at the Tolmachev Military and Political Academy in Leningrad. After returning to China, whether during the war years or in peacetime, we had many opportunities to interact and work together. His character and revolutionary spirit left a deep impression on me.

Comrade Jingguang dedicated himself to the revolution from his youth. In 1922, he joined the Communist Party of China. In the 1920s, he studied in the Soviet Union twice and was one of the earliest party members to engage in military affairs. He had a solid foundation in military theory and extensive experience in revolutionary warfare. He was not only an outstanding military commander but also an excellent political worker. During the first and second domestic revolutionary wars, he participated in the Northern Expedition, led troops in the anti-encirclement campaigns in the Minnan Soviet Area, and opened up base areas. His outstanding political work transformed the National Revolutionary Army that participated in the Ningdu Uprising into a formidable fighting force of the people's army. During subsequent wars, he commanded numerous major battles, notably the "Four Defenses of Lianjiang" and the Hengbao Campaign during the War of Liberation. Even in the intense war environment, he actively engaged in military academic research. In the Central Soviet Area, he translated the Soviet Red Army's "Field Regulations." During the Yan'an period, his articles such as "Close Combat Tactics" and "Guidelines for Guerrilla Warfare" were praised by Comrade Mao Zedong. He devoted his entire life to the liberation of the Chinese people and the construction of the people's army.

Comrade Jingguang possessed a fearless, pioneering, and hardworking revolutionary spirit, particularly notable for his courage in creating new work situations. During his tenure as the commander of the Garrison Corps, the Yan'an-Shaanxi-Gansu Border Region faced internal disturbances from bandits, external threats from Japanese invaders, and frequent provocations from the Kuomintang reactionaries. The situation was extremely complex. Under the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Jingguang faced these challenges head-on. He quickly organized the garrison troops and, in a short time, eliminated the bandit threat, repelled dozens of Japanese attacks, and thwarted the Kuomintang reactionaries' attempts to disrupt and blockade the border region. After the founding of the People's Republic, Comrade Jingguang was tasked with establishing the naval leadership. Despite the weak industrial foundation, particularly in shipbuilding, and the lack of naval knowledge among cadres and soldiers, he took on the heavy responsibility. He tirelessly traveled to coastal areas, leading the troops to quickly build a series of wharves, positions, and airports. He proposed that naval construction should focus on political thought, organization, and technology, personally studying naval knowledge, and overseeing the establishment of various technical academies. In a relatively short period, he cultivated a large number of leading cadres and professional technical personnel. He actively explored the development strategy for the people's navy, providing many suggestions and opinions. The people's navy grew from nothing to a considerable naval combat force, and this growth is inseparable from Comrade Jingguang's pioneering spirit, foresight, and hard work.

Comrade Jingguang had a strong sense of party discipline, dared to uphold principles, and insist on truth. During the period when Wang Ming's "Left" adventurism dominated, he was wrongly labeled as the "representative of the Roming line in the military" and received incorrect treatment. However, even in adversity, he endured humiliation, worked hard regardless of his position, and did his best in the tasks assigned to him. During the Cultural Revolution, he was repeatedly persecuted by the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counter-revolutionary cliques, being falsely accused of numerous crimes. Even in the most difficult circumstances, he remained steadfast in his revolutionary beliefs and fought resolutely. At the Ninth Central Committee's First Plenary Session, he refused to vote for the main members of the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counter-revolutionary cliques. He met with Comrade Ye Jianying twice to provide important suggestions for solving the "Gang of Four" problem, demonstrating the loyalty of an old Communist.

After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Comrade Jingguang wholeheartedly supported the party's line, principles, and policies in the new era. He responded to the Party Central Committee's call to step down to the second line. In his later years, he diligently wrote his memoirs, summarizing the rich experiences of military and naval construction, leaving a valuable spiritual legacy.

Comrade Jingguang's life was a revolutionary life, a fighting life, and a glorious life. His revolutionary achievements, his noble character, and his spirit of dedication will forever be remembered.

　　悼肖劲光同志
    ３月２９日傍晚，听到肖劲光同志逝世的噩耗，我哀思如涌，为国家和军队失去了一位优秀的领导人深感痛惜。
    我同劲光同志是在１９２７年他第二次赴苏留学期间相识的。那时我在莫斯科中山大学就读，他在列宁格勒托尔马乔夫军政学院学习军事。回国以后，无论是在战争年代，还是和平时期，我们曾多次交往并在一起工作过。他的为人和革命精神，给我留下了难忘的印象。
    劲光同志从青年时代起就投身革命，在１９２２年就加入了中国共产党。在二十年代，他曾两次赴苏联学习，是我党最早涉足军事领域的老同志之一。他有较高的军事理论修养，又长期参加革命战争实践。他既是一位卓越的军事指挥员，又是一位优秀的政治工作者。第一、二次国内革命战争时期，他参加了北伐战争，指挥部队进行了闽西苏区反“围剿”，开辟根据地等的斗争，并以杰出的政治工作，将参加宁都起义的国民党军队改造为人民军队的一支作战劲旅。在以后的战争时期，他指挥过诸多重大战役，尤以解放战争中的“四保临江”、衡宝战役最为著名。在紧张的战争环境，他还积极从事军事学术的研究，在中央苏区就翻译过苏联红军的《野战条令》。在延安时期，他写的《近战战术》、《游击战争指导要令》等文章，受到毛泽东同志的赞扬。他把自己的一生都献给了中国人民的解放事业和人民军队的建设。
    劲光同志具有不怕困难、一往无前和艰苦创业的革命精神，特别可贵的是勇于开创工作的新局面。他在担任留守兵团司令员期间，陕甘宁边区内有土匪的骚扰破坏，外有日寇威逼河防，加上国民党顽固派频繁制造磨擦事件，斗争形势极为复杂。在党中央和毛泽东同志的直接领导下，劲光同志迎难而上，迅速组建起留守部队，并领导部队在很短时间内肃清了匪患，打退了日寇数十次进攻，粉碎了国民党顽固派对边区的破坏和封锁。建国以后，劲光同志受命组建海军领导机关，负责领导海军建设。在国家工业特别是造船工业基础薄弱和干部战士普遍没有海军知识等困难条件下，他毅然挑起重担，不辞劳苦，亲赴沿海地区考察，领导部队迅速修建起一批码头、阵地、机场。他提出海军建设要打好政治思想、组织和技术三个“桩子”，带头学习海军知识，亲自抓各类技术院校的建设，在不太长的时间内就培养出一大批领导骨干和专业技术人才。他积极探索人民海军的发展战略，对海军建设提出了许多建议和意见。人民海军从无到有，从小到大，逐步成长为一支具有相当规模的海上战斗力量，同劲光同志的艰苦创业精神、远见卓识和辛勤劳动是密不可分的。
    劲光同志具有坚强的党性，敢于坚持原则，坚持真理。在王明“左”倾冒险主义占统治时期，他曾被扣上“罗明路线在军队中的代表”罪名，受到错误处理。但他身处逆境，忍辱负重，不计地位高低，努力做好分配给自己的工作。在“文化大革命”中，他先后受到林彪、江青两个反革命集团的打击迫害，被强加上许多莫须有的罪名。在十分困难的情况下，仍保持坚定的革命信念，进行了坚决的斗争。党的九届一中全会上，他拒不投林彪、江青两个反革命集团主要成员的票。他两次找到叶剑英同志，对解决“四人帮”问题提出重要建议，表现了一个老共产党员的赤胆忠心。
    党的十一届三中全会以后，劲光同志衷心拥护党在新时期的路线、方针、政策。他响应党中央的号召，退居二线。在晚年，他孜孜不倦地从事回忆录的写作，总结军队建设，特别是海军建设的丰富经验，留下了一笔宝贵的精神财富。
    劲光同志的一生，是革命的一生，战斗的一生，光辉的一生。他的革命业绩，他的高尚品德，他的献身精神，将永远留在人们的记忆中。
