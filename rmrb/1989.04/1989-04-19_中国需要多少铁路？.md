	China needs how much railway?

	China needs how much railway?

	The earliest person to answer this question was Dr. Sun Yat-sen. After investigating the economic development process and actual situation of capitalist countries in the early 20th century, he proposed in "The International Development of China" a goal of 100,000 miles (160,000 kilometers) and required it to be completed in 10 years. In the following decades, experts and scholars proposed various data, all of which were above 100,000 kilometers. Even if we take 100,000 kilometers as the standard, if we build 1,000 kilometers of railway each year, it will take 44 more years to form a basic national network that can meet the needs. However, from the construction of China's first railway in 1876 to the present, there are only 50,000 plus kilometers of railway. Isn't it time to make a decisive decision now? If we do not take action, we will leave this major decision and difficulty to future generations. How can we account for this to the year 2000? The state should increase the proportion of investment in new railways. With limited national strength, we should mobilize local investments.

### 中国需要多少铁路？

　　中国需要多少铁路？
    成都铁路局党委书记　刘德枢
    中国需要多少铁路？
    最早回答这个问题的是孙中山先生，他在考察了２０世纪初资本主义国家经济发展进程和实况后，在《建国方略》中提出了１０万英里（１６万公里）的目标，而且要求１０年建成。此后几十年，专家学者们提出各种数据，也都在１０万公里以上。即以１０万公里而论，每年修路１０００公里，也要４４年以后才能形成一个基本适应的全国路网。可是，从１８７６年我国第一条铁路建设至今，总共只有５万多公里铁路。难道现在还不是痛下决心的时候吗，再不起步，我们就把这么一个重大决策、难题留给了后人，何以向２０００年交待？国家对新建铁路的投资比重应该提高。国力有限，应该发动地方投入。
