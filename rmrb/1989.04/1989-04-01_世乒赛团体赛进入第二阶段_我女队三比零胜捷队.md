The World Table Tennis Championships team event has entered the second stage. Today, China's women's team won a beautiful match, defeating the strong Czech team 3-0. As soon as the match ended, Coach Xi En Ting said, "It went better than expected. This victory is very encouraging for our morale."

China's team first sent the penholder "trick shot" Chen Zi He to face Kasalova. Kasalova had performed well in the early Asia-Europe confrontation match this year. As soon as she took the court, she smashed the ball with both her forehand and backhand. However, when the ball hit Chen Zi He's long-pimpled racket, it came back soft and with a strong underspin. Kasalova's smashes kept hitting the net, frustrating her to the point of shaking her head. Chen Zi He won the first two sets 21-17 and 21-13. Next, Olympic champion Chen Jing faced the veteran player Hrachova from the Czech team, and the match was not easy. Both sets were tied at 18-18 before Chen Jing won the next three points to secure the victory. In the third doubles match, the Czech team paired their first two players, while China sent Li Huifen and Chen Zi He. The two Czech players were hesitant to receive long-pimpled returns, losing confidence as the match progressed, and eventually lost the last set 13-21 and 6-21.

The 40th World Table Tennis Championships team event entered the second stage today. China's men's team will face Hungary in the early hours of April 1st, Beijing time. It is estimated that winning should not be a problem. Last night, in the final preliminary match, the Hungarian team narrowly avoided losing to the Italian team. The Italian team, coached by Cai Zhenhua, led 3-1 but then lost the next four points, frustrating Cai to the point of jumping up, wishing he could take the court himself.

As of the time of this report, the results of the other women's team matches in the second stage are as follows: Romania defeated Yugoslavia 3-0, South Korea defeated Chinese Taipei 3-0, North Korea defeated Bulgaria 3-2, and Hong Kong defeated the Soviet Union 3-0.

### 世乒赛团体赛进入第二阶段  我女队三比零胜捷队

　　世乒赛团体赛进入第二阶段
    我女队三比零胜捷队
    本报多特蒙德３月３１日电  记者刘小明、江建国报道：中国乒乓女将今天在世乒赛团体第二阶段首场比赛中，打了一个漂亮仗，以３∶０战胜实力较强的捷克斯洛伐克队。比赛刚一结束，郗恩庭教练就说：“打得比预想的顺利，这场胜利对鼓舞士气有很大作用。”
    中国队首先派直拍“怪球手”陈子荷出战卡萨洛娃。卡萨洛娃今年初亚欧对抗赛时表现不凡，她一上场就正手反手猛抽，谁知球碰到陈子荷的长胶粒拍上，软绵绵地弹回来还带着强烈下旋。卡萨洛娃攻球连连下网，急得她直摇头。最后陈子荷以２１∶１７、２１∶１３连取两局。接着奥运会冠军陈静与捷队老将赫拉霍娃打得可不轻松，两局均是１８平后才连赢三分获胜的。第三盘双打，捷队仍是前面两人配对，中国队则由李惠芬、陈子荷出场。捷两位女将对接长胶拍回球很怵头，越打越没信心，以１３∶２１、６∶２１失去最后一分。
    第４０届世乒赛团体比赛今天进入第二阶段。中国男队将在北京时间４月１日凌晨首先出战匈牙利队，估计获胜问题不大。昨晚匈牙利队在预赛最后一战中，险些败给意大利队。意队先以３∶１领先，随后却连丢４分，气得在意大利队执教的蔡振华跳起来，恨不得自己上去打。
    截至记者发稿时，女子团体第二阶段另几场结果是：罗马尼亚队胜南斯拉夫队３∶０，南朝鲜队胜中国台北队３∶０，朝鲜队胜保加利亚队３∶２，香港队胜苏联队３∶０。
