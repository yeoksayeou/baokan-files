Premier Li Peng is deeply concerned about the severe wind and hailstorm that struck parts of Sichuan Province, including Luzhou. He has expressed his heartfelt sympathies to the affected people and instructed the Sichuan Provincial Government to spare no effort in disaster relief work, rescue the injured, ensure the people's livelihood, and help the affected areas recover production and rebuild their homes.

According to the information available, the wind and hailstorm occurred between 11 PM on the 19th and 4 AM on the 20th in Luzhou, Zigong, Longchang, Yongchuan, Jinyan, and Fushun counties and cities in Sichuan Province. The disaster caused extensive damage to buildings, severely damaged public facilities, and resulted in over 200 deaths and injuries. In Luzhou City, the largest hailstones were as big as eggs, and the strong winds uprooted century-old trees and knocked down power poles. In the suburbs, 70% of the houses in two townships collapsed, and tens of thousands of acres of crops were destroyed. The city's water, electricity, and communication services were disrupted, and the main roads leading to the city were blocked.
