Every weekend, the dance hall inside the Beijing Science Hall near Zhongguancun fills with the sound of melodious music. Pairs of middle-aged and elderly scientists, scholars, and experts step into the dance floor, moving gracefully to the rhythm. The soft lighting, warm atmosphere, and elegant dance steps seem to transport these middle-aged and elderly intellectuals back to their youthful days.

In recent years, to enrich the leisure activities of scientists and better serve experts, the Beijing Science Hall has opened a dance hall, gym, chess room, game room, and movie screening room. On weekends and Sundays, these facilities are available for middle-aged and elderly scientists to enjoy dancing, entertainment, and fitness activities. Additionally, the Science Hall frequently organizes chess tournaments, bridge competitions, and calligraphy contests within the scientific community.

High Hongzhi, the director of the Science Hall, explained that in recent years, there has been a significant increase in the premature deaths of scientists. Most intellectuals spend their days working at their desks, with little time for physical and mental relaxation, leading to a decline in their health. The organizers of the hall plan to provide a suitable venue for elderly intellectuals, aiming to make the hall a true "home for scientists."

Professor Li Zhigang, aged 70, from the China University of Petroleum, happily remarked, "The dances held by the Science Hall are just to our liking."

　　中关村的老年之角
    沈根钧
    每逢周末，位于中关村附近的北京科学会堂舞厅内，悠扬的音乐声起，一对对中老年科学家、学者和专家走进舞池，跳起轻快而优雅的舞步。舞厅内，柔和的灯光，温馨的气氛，翩翩的舞姿，仿佛把这些中老年知识分子引回到如梦如幻的青年时代。
    近年来，为了活跃和丰富科学家们的业余生活，更好地为专家服务，北京科学会堂内新辟了舞厅、健身房、棋艺室、游艺室、电影录相室等。周末和星期日供中老年科学家进行跳舞、娱乐和健身等活动。此外，科学会堂经常在科技界内组织围棋赛、桥牌赛、书法比赛等活动。
    科学会堂的负责人高洪志同志介绍说，近年来，科学家早逝现象很严重。大部分知识分子整天伏案工作，身心得不到调节和休息，体质下降。会堂主办者打算，为老年知识分子提供一个适合他们活动特点的场所，把会堂真正办成“科学家之家”。
    七十岁高龄的石油工业大学教授李志强高兴地说：“科学会堂举办的舞会，很合我们的胃口。”
