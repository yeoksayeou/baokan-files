Tightening the Reins on Currency
— West Germany's Persistent Control of Inflation
By Jiang Jianguo, People's Daily Correspondent

In today's world, many countries are plagued by inflation. West Germany, however, is one of the few countries with a stable economy. Since the introduction of the Deutsche Mark in June 1948, West Germany has established a comprehensive mechanism to control inflation, flexibly using various policy tools to successfully stabilize the value of the Mark, providing favorable conditions for the healthy development of the economy. West Germany is also the only country in the world that has written currency stability into its laws.

Currency Stability Contributes to Price Stability

Currently, the Deutsche Mark is the second strongest currency in the world after the Swiss Franc and the second most important international reserve currency after the US Dollar. In the international market, Mark loans rank fourth, and its exchange rate against the US Dollar has increased by 215% over 40 years. The stability of the currency has made a decisive contribution to the relative stability of prices. West Germany has the lowest rate of price increases among developed countries. From 1948 to 1988, the average annual increase in consumer prices was only 2.6%, and from March 1986 to January 1987, prices showed a downward trend. Due to various domestic and international factors, West Germany cannot completely avoid price increases. Over the past 40 years, prices have risen by a total of 183%, while in Italy, they have risen by 1491%, in France by 1277%, in Britain by 1253%, in Japan by 713%, and in the United States by 384%. In 1948, the price of a 40-watt light bulb was 1.38 Marks, and now it is only 1.93 Marks. During the three years I have been in West Germany, I have only seen daily consumer goods occasionally decrease in price, never increase. From 1960 to 1987, West Germany's GDP increased sixfold, while the money supply increased only fivefold. Since 1948, workers' real wages have increased fourfold.

West Germany rose from the ruins of war to become one of the world's most economically developed countries. It can be said that the stability of the currency has made an outstanding contribution.

The Lessons of Two Major Inflations in the 20th Century

West Germany places the fight against inflation at the top of its economic and monetary policies, based on the bitter lessons of the two major inflations Germany experienced in this century. After Germany's defeat in World War I, the Weimar Republic government, in order to pay huge war reparations, increased taxation, issued large amounts of public debt, and printed money indiscriminately, leading to an unbelievable rise in prices: a head of cabbage was priced at 50 million Marks, and a postage stamp in 1923 that could have bought a villa in Berlin in 1890. Severe inflation worsened the economic situation, and many businesses went bankrupt. In the end, the currency became almost worthless, and many people's lifelong savings were wiped out.

During World War II, Hitler, in order to raise funds for his aggressive wars, again printed money indiscriminately, plunging Germany into another inflation disaster. At that time, it was common to use a 50 Reichsmark note to light a cigarette. Hoarding was rampant, and shop shelves were empty. American cigarettes became a means of storage and a measure of the value of goods, with a few American cigarettes enough to exchange for a grand piano.

Currency Reform as the Starting Point of the Economic Miracle

In June 1948, a group led by the former West German Minister of Economics, Ludwig Erhard, after two years of preparation, decisively implemented a historic currency reform, replacing the worthless Reichsmark with the current Deutsche Mark, performing major surgery on the hyperinflation. According to the reform plan, each resident received 60 new Marks at a 1:1 ratio, even those without old currency received this amount. For those with deposits in banks, the principle was to exchange at a 10:1 rate, but half of this amount was not paid out immediately. Later, it was decided that 70% of the amount not paid out would not be paid at all, and the final actual exchange rate was 100:6.5. This reduced the money supply by 93%, and Hitler's huge national debt was effectively written off. The new Mark quickly won the trust of the people. The day after the currency reform, goods that merchants had long hoarded immediately appeared in the shops, and the economy began to run again. At the same time, Erhard, against the advice of others, abolished all price controls and rationing, implementing the principles of a social market economy. Although the long-suppressed consumption demand suddenly surged, causing rapid currency circulation and price increases, due to the stability of the new currency, prices gradually stabilized. The black market declined, and workers' enthusiasm for work increased. From June 1948 to March 1949, labor productivity increased by 30%, and by the summer of 1949, food production had also significantly increased. Less than two years after the currency reform, industrial production increased by 83%. Now everyone knows that as long as they work hard, they can earn wages with purchasing power. West Germany's economic takeoff started from this point. It is also because of this that avoiding inflation at all costs has become a fundamental national policy deeply rooted in West Germany.

The Independent Federal Bank of West Germany

In the post-war period, the most important measure West Germany took to overcome inflation was to legally establish the independent status of the central bank—the Deutsche Bundesbank—and to place the task of defending the value of the Mark, both domestically and internationally, at the top of its list of tasks.

According to the banking law passed by the West German Bundestag in 1957, the Bundesbank does not accept government directives but has the obligation to generally support the government's economic policies and provide advice and information on monetary policy. The government has the right to participate in Bundesbank meetings but has the right to propose without the right to vote.

The government cannot arbitrarily borrow from the Bundesbank but can only obtain short-term loans, and the amount and scope are limited. If the government has a surplus, it must first repay the Bundesbank's loans. If the government is short of money, it can only raise funds in the capital market. At the same time, the Bundesbank strengthens the dependence of commercial banks on the central bank through the minimum reserve system. In addition, the Bundesbank also participates in West Germany's banking supervision bureau, ensuring supervision and control over commercial banks.

In 1956, when the Bundesbank raised the discount rate to curb price increases, it was publicly criticized by then-Chancellor Adenauer, who said it was a heavy blow to the West German economy. In the 1970s, when Schmidt was Chancellor, he once said that he would rather have a 5% inflation rate than a 5% unemployment rate. The Bundesbank, based on its legally determined position, withstood the government's pressure.

Policy Tools to Control the Money Supply

West Germany is a market economy country, and the financial sector is also freely competitive. The Bundesbank mainly influences the activities of commercial banks in the financial market through discount, pledge, minimum reserve, open market, savings, and foreign exchange transactions, combining the long-term "coarse adjustment" and short-term "fine-tuning" to achieve the fundamental goal of "developing the economy with the least amount of money."

Among the above six policies, discount, pledge, and minimum reserve fall within the scope of "coarse adjustment," aiming to send signals to the financial sector and focusing on long-term effects, with discount and pledge being the more important tools, often used alternately or in combination; savings and foreign exchange policies fall within the scope of "fine-tuning," focusing on short-term market stabilization and conducted as "quietly" as possible. The open market policy has both coarse and fine-tuning functions. Since 1967, West Germany has implemented the liberalization of commercial bank interest rates, and the interest rates of commercial banks and the guiding interest rates of the Bundesbank are no longer directly linked. The Bundesbank influences the interbank lending rates, deposit and loan rates, and lending scale among commercial banks through these tools.

To further promote the stability of the Mark, the Bundesbank, starting in 1974, first adopted the measure of publicly announcing the money supply for each year in advance, aiming to make various sectors of society voluntarily cooperate to jointly control inflation. In the process of formulating this indicator, the Bundesbank, the government, and expert committees jointly study the entire economic development process, estimate the actual growth potential of production, and also consider the factors of price changes, ensuring that the growth of the money supply meets the needs of production growth while keeping it at the lowest level.

The Bundesbank has always emphasized that without the cooperation of all sectors of society, inflation cannot be effectively controlled. In recent years, the West German government has controlled the annual growth rate of national expenditures within 3%, reduced the budget deficit, and contributed to the stability of the currency.

　　牢牢勒住货币的缰绳
    ——西德坚持不懈控制通货膨胀
    本报记者  江建国
    当今世界许多国家被通货膨胀所困扰。而西德是少数几个经济稳定的国家之一。自１９４８年６月西德马克诞生以来，西德建立了一整套控制通货膨胀的机制，灵活运用种种政策手段，成功地稳定了马克币值，为经济的健康发展提供了有利的条件。西德也是世界上唯一把币值稳定写入法律的国家。
    货币稳定为物价稳定作出贡献
    目前，西德马克是世界上仅次于瑞士法郎的坚挺货币，也是仅次于美元的国际储备货币。在国际市场上马克贷款居第四位，它对美元的汇率４０年中提高了２１５％。货币的稳定为物价的相对稳定作出了决定性贡献。西德的物价上涨率是发达国家中最低的，１９４８年到１９８８年，平均消费物价年上涨率仅为２．６％，１９８６年３月至１９８７年１月物价呈下降趋势。由于受国内外各种因素的影响，西德不可能完全避免物价上涨，４０年来总计上涨了１８３％，而意大利同期上涨了１４９１％，法国上涨了１２７７％，英国是１２５３％，日本是７１３％，美国是３８４％。１９４８年１个４０瓦的灯泡价格是１．３８马克，现在仅是１．９３马克。记者在西德３年多来，只见日用消费品时有下降，未见上涨。１９６０年到１９８７年，西德国民生产总值增长了６倍，货币发行量仅增长５倍。１９４８年以来，职工实际工资增加了４倍。
    西德从一片战争的废墟上建成了世界第一流经济发达国家，应该说，货币的稳定作出了杰出的贡献。
    ２０世纪两次恶性通货膨胀的教训
    西德把反对通货膨胀放在经济政策和货币政策的首位，是基于德国人吃够了本世纪两次恶性通货膨胀的苦头。１９１８年德国在第一次世界大战中战败后，魏玛共和国政府为了支付巨额战争赔款，加紧抽税，大量发行公债，滥印纸币，导致物价上涨到令人难以置信的地步：一棵苤蓝标价５０００万马克，１９２３年的一张邮票价格如果在１８９０年则可以购买柏林的一幢别墅。严重的通货膨胀使经济形势恶化，大量企业倒闭。最后货币几乎成为废纸，许多人的终生积蓄化为乌有。
    第二次世界大战中，希特勒为了筹款进行侵略战争，又滥发货币，再次使德国陷入通货膨胀灾难。当时，用５０帝国马克的钞票代替火柴点烟是常见的事。囤积居奇盛行，商店柜台空空如也。美国占领军的香烟取代货币成为储存手段和衡量商品价值的标准，几条美国烟就可以换一架大钢琴。
    货币改革成为经济奇迹的起点
    １９４８年６月，德国西占区一个以西德前经济部长艾哈德为首的小组经过两年的酝酿，果断地推行历史上前所未有的货币改革，以现在的西德马克取代毫无价值的帝国马克，对恶性通货膨胀动了大手术。根据改革方案，每个居民以１∶１的比例得到６０个新马克，没有旧货币的人也得到这笔钱。对在银行尚有存款者原则上以１０∶１的兑换率兑换新马克，但其中的一半暂不支付。后又决定，在暂不支付的款项中７０％不再支付，而且最后兑换的实际比例是１００∶６．５。这样一来，货币流通量减少了９３％，希特勒欠下的巨额国债等于一笔勾销了。新马克很快赢得了老百姓的信任。货币改革的第二天，商人长期囤积的货物立即出现在商店里，经济重新运转起来。与此同时，艾哈德力排众议，取消了一切物价管制和配给制度，实行社会市场经济原则。尽管由于多年被压抑的消费需求突然迸发，造成货币周转速度快和物价急速上升，但是，由于新货币的稳定，价格逐渐趋于平稳。黑市衰落，工人劳动积极性提高。１９４８年６月到１９４９年３月，劳动生产率就提高了３０％，到１９４９年夏天，食品产量也大大增加。货币改革后不到两年，工业产量增加了８３％。现在人人都知道，只要努力工作，就能得到具有购买力的工资。西德的经济起飞就是从这一点开始的。也正是由于这一点，不惜一切代价避免通货膨胀就成为西德一项深入人心的基本国策。
    独立于政府之外的西德联邦银行
    战后西德在克服通货膨胀的过程中，最重要一项措施是通过法律规定了中央银行——德意志联邦银行的独立地位，同时把对内对外保卫马克币值的任务列入各项任务的首位。
    按１９５７年西德联邦议院通过的银行法，联邦银行不接受政府指示，但它有义务一般地支持政府的经济政策，在货币政策方面提供咨询，通报情况。政府有权参加联邦银行会议，有创议权无表决权。
    政府不能从联邦银行任意透支，只有权得到短期资金贷款，而且数量和范围都受限制。政府一旦收益赢余，首先要归还联邦银行的贷款。政府缺钱，只能到资本市场上去征集。同时，联邦银行通过最低准备金制度加强商业银行对中央银行的依赖性。此外，联邦银行还参加西德的银行监督局，保证了对商业银行的监督控制。
    １９５６年联邦银行提高贴现率以阻止物价上涨时，遭到当时的总理阿登纳公开抨击，说这是对西德经济的沉重打击。７０年代施密特任总理时，曾经表示，宁要５％的通货膨胀率，不要５％的失业率。联邦银行依据法律确定的地位，顶住了政府的压力。
    调控货币流通量的政策手段
    西德是市场经济国家，在金融领域同样是自由竞争。联邦银行主要是通过贴现、抵押、最低准备金、公开市场、储蓄和外汇交易等政策手段去影响商业银行在金融市场上的活动，把着眼长期效果的“粗调”和着眼短期效果的“微调”相结合，达到“用最少的货币量发展经济”的根本目标。
    在上述６项政策中，贴现、抵押、最低准备金属于“粗调”范围，目的是向金融界发出信号，着眼于长期效果，其中贴现和抵押两种手段更为重要，经常交替或同时配套使用；储蓄及外汇两项政策属于“微调”范畴，着眼于近期平抑市场动荡，而且尽量“悄悄地”进行。公开市场政策兼具粗、微调两项功能。西德自１９６７年以来实行商业银行利率自由化，商业银行利率和联邦银行的主导利率之间已不再直接挂钩，联邦银行就是通过这些工具去影响商业银行之间的拆借利率、存贷利率、放款规模等。
    为了进一步促进马克币值稳定，联邦银行自１９７４年起首次采取每年预先公布货币供应量的措施，目的在于使社会各界自愿合作共同控制通货膨胀。在制定这个指标过程中，联邦银行、政府和专家委员会共同研究整个经济发展过程，根据生产潜力实际增长可能性，也估计到价格变动的因素，保证货币供应量的增长既满足生产增长的需要，又把它降低到最低水平。
    联邦银行始终强调，没有社会各界的合作，通货膨胀就不可能真正有效地得到控制。西德政府近年来在财政政策上把国家开支的年增长率控制在３％以内，降低了预算赤字，为货币的稳定作出了贡献。
