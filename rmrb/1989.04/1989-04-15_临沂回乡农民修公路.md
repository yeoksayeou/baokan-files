Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, April 14th.

The Linyi region of Shandong Province has made proper arrangements for over 100,000 returning farmers to build roads, aiming to improve the backward transportation conditions in their hometowns. Due to the reduction in construction scale in cities, over 100,000 farmers who had gone to the cities to work found it difficult to find jobs and were forced to return to their hometowns at the beginning of this year. The regional committee and administrative office of Linyi believe that most of these people have some skills, and a significant number have participated in engineering projects. Returning to farm work cannot fully utilize their abilities. Therefore, they decided to have the transportation department specifically organize the returning farmers to participate in the 250-kilometer spring road construction project for the entire region, and to jointly resolve the labor service subsidy issues for the workers who are on duty.

　　临沂回乡农民修公路
    据新华社济南４月１４日电　（通讯员李敬堂）山东省临沂地区妥善安排１０万多回乡农民修建公路，改变家乡交通落后状况。由于城市压缩基建规模，今年年初这个地区１０万多进城农民因找活难而被迫返回家乡。临沂地区地委、行署认为，这些人大多数有一技之长，相当一部分参加过工程，回乡种地不能充分发挥他们的作用，于是决定让交通部门具体组织还乡农民参加全区２５０公里春季筑路工程，并合理解决出勤民工的劳务补助问题。
