A new mode of production based on "information" and characterized by "speed" is changing the industrial civilization that people have grown accustomed to. The global ten billion youth are naturally affected by this wave, with Western youth being the first to experience it.

The rapid changes, complex social and interpersonal relationships, and especially the torment of unemployment, have caused some youth to become psychologically unbalanced. The increase in alcoholism, drug abuse, and even suicides are manifestations of this imbalance. However, most youth welcome the "information revolution." They have not only accepted modern facilities such as home computers, credit cards, and video phones but also their thoughts and ideas are changing.

Generally speaking, Western youth in the 1960s were engrossed in student movements, in the 1970s they became disillusioned, and by the 1980s, many began to awaken from their "dreams," with a heightened sense of anxiety. They gradually realized the immense driving force of "information" on social development and understood that to survive in the competition, one must strive for self-improvement.

In France, in the past, obtaining a master's degree would secure a good job. Nowadays, even with a doctoral degree, it is not easy to find a satisfactory job. Therefore, many students have changed from their previous lazy and idle ways to diligent study. For example, law students spend 17 hours a week on self-study. In competitive America, some young people, after struggling through a semester in universities where tuition fees are continuously rising, do not dare to rest during the holidays. They participate in social services or work to gain practical skills and fund their education. In West Germany, the dropout rate in universities is high, with 15% of engineering students failing their exams each year, and the dropout rate from enrollment to graduation reaching 40%. Even after graduation, one cannot completely avoid the misfortune of unemployment. This situation forces young people to study hard to obtain a diploma and skills for self-reliance.

At the same time, the ideals of young people are changing. In Britain, the percentage of young people who wish to enter politics has dropped from 32% twenty years ago to just 5% today. Many top graduates from Oxford and Cambridge, lured by high salaries, have left for foreign countries or joined foreign companies in London, making money their grand ambition. Most young women, on the other hand, aspire to professions such as teaching and medicine, which have higher social status and more stable incomes.

In the face of intensified international competition and serious unemployment problems, the wealth gap in Western societies has widened, even giving rise to a new class of "new poor" who have lost all normal income and rely on social welfare. Consequently, a trend of caring for society and helping others has quietly emerged among young people. In the United States, there are youth service groups that help elderly widows and widowers purchase food and medicine, or voluntarily accompany the elderly and assist them in preparing for winter. The Greenpeace organization, which takes on the mission of "saving the Earth," has its main leaders as young people in their twenties and thirties. British singer Bob Geldof became a representative of a generation of youth for advocating charity concerts for African relief. In France, in recent years, before winter arrives, Paris and provincial cities set up many "love restaurants" that provide free meals to all those who have lost their ability to live. The organizers of these restaurants are almost entirely young people. This method cannot fundamentally solve the problem, but it reflects the new image of contemporary youth who care about the suffering of others.

　　新浪潮冲击下的西方青年
　　王翘
    以“信息”为基础、以“快速”为特点的新生产方式，正在改变人们习以为常的工业化文明。全球十亿青年自然也受到这种浪潮的冲击，首当其冲的则是西方青年。
    日新月异的变化，复杂的社会和人际关系特别是失业的煎熬，使一部分青年的心理失衡。酗酒、吸毒者增多，甚至有人绝望轻生，就是这种失衡的表现。不过，大多数青年对“信息革命”持欢迎态度，他们不仅接受了家用电脑、信用卡和电视电话等现代化设施，而且思想观念也在发生变化。
    一般地说，西方青年６０年代曾醉心于学生运动，７０年代转而消沉，进入８０年代以后，许多人开始从“梦幻”中苏醒，忧患意识增强了，逐渐意识到“信息化”对社会发展的巨大推动力，而要在竞争中求得生存，必须致力于自我完善。
    在法国，过去只要拿到硕士学位，就能有份好工作。如今，即使拿到博士学位，也不容易找到满意的工作。所以，许多大学生一改过去的闲逸懒散转而刻苦学习。例如，法律专业的学生每周花在自习上的时间就达１７小时。在崇尚竞争的美国，一些年轻人在学费持续上涨的大学里拚搏一学期之后，假期里也不敢喘息，他们为了增长实际才能和自筹学费，利用假期参加社会服务或打工赚钱。西德大学阶段的淘汰率高，理工科大学生中每年有１５％的人不能通过考试，从入学到结业，淘汰率高达４０％。即使读到毕业，也不能完全排除失业的厄运。这种形势迫使青年人去刻苦学习，以求得立身之本——文凭和能力。
    与此同时，年轻人的理想也在发生变化。英国年轻人希望“从政”的，２０年前占３２％，而今只有５％。牛津和剑桥毕业的许多一流人才在高薪引诱下远走他乡，或进入伦敦城内的外国公司，赚钱已成为他们的宏愿。而多数女青年则渴望从事诸如教师、医生等社会地位较高，收入较稳定的职业。
    在国际竞争加剧和失业问题严重的情况下，西方社会的贫富差距拉大，甚至出现了一种失去一切正常收入而只能求之于社会救济的“新穷人”。于是关心社会、助人为乐的风气在年轻人中悄然兴起。在美国，有一种青年服务小组，他们帮孤寡老人采购食品和药品，或义务陪伴老人并协助他们做过冬的准备。以“拯救地球”为己任的绿色和平组织，其主要领导成员多是二三十岁的青年。英国歌星格尔多夫因倡导为非洲赈灾义演而成为一代青年的杰出代表。在法国，近几年每当冬天来临前，巴黎和外省城市都设立许多“爱心餐厅”，向一切丧失生活能力的“新穷人”免费供应膳食。倡导和组织这些餐厅的几乎全是年轻人。这种办法自然不能从根本上解决问题，但它反映了当代青年关心他人疾苦的新风貌。
