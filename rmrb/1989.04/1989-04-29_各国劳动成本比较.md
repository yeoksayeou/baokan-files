Recently, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released a report on labor costs in various countries around the world.

The average hourly labor cost in 1987 for various countries was as follows: the United States $13.44, Norway $17.39, Switzerland $17.14, West Germany $16.87, the Netherlands $15.46, Sweden $15.12, Belgium $15.02, Denmark $14.56, and Finland $13.52. According to 1986 statistics, Switzerland, Norway, and West Germany had higher labor costs than the United States. However, by 1987, eight European countries had higher labor costs than the United States.

The labor costs in Asian, African, and Latin American countries are much lower compared to Europe. Although Japan's labor costs have risen sharply in recent years, in 1987 it was still only $11.14 per hour. One of the "Four Asian Tigers," South Korea, had an hourly labor cost of $1.79 in 1987. The labor costs in Latin American countries are even lower than in Asia. In 1988, Brazil's hourly labor cost was $1.49, and Mexico's was $1.57.

　　各国劳动成本比较
    最近，美国劳工统计局发表的一项统计数字报告，公布了世界各国劳动成本情况。
    １９８７年每小时的平均劳动成本，各国分别为：美国１３．４４美元，挪威１７．３９美元，瑞士１７．１４美元，联邦德国１６．８７美元，荷兰１５．４６美元，瑞典１５．１２美元，比利时１５．０２美元，丹麦１４．５６美元，芬兰１３．５２美元。据１９８６年的统计，瑞士、挪威、联邦德国的劳动成本高于美国。而到１９８７年，欧洲已有８个国家的劳动成本高于美国。
    亚洲、非洲和拉美国家的劳动成本与欧洲相比要低得多。尽管日本的劳动成本近年来急剧上升，但１９８７年也只有１１．１４美元。亚洲“四小龙”之一的南朝鲜，１９８７年的劳动成本每小时为１．７９美元。拉丁美洲国家的劳动成本甚至比亚洲还低。去年，巴西每小时劳动成本为１．４９美元，墨西哥为１．５７美元。
