The nationwide selection of golden anniversary couples is gaining momentum, despite some young people's indifference. The activity has been warmly received by elderly couples. The reporter learned from the organizing committee, set up at the All-China Women's Federation, that over the past four months, more than 600 couples have registered to participate.

It is understood that among these 600-plus golden anniversary couples, there are representatives from the Han, Uyghur, Korean, Mongolian, Daur, Hui, Bai, and Manchu ethnic groups. Except for the Tibet Autonomous Region, which has not yet had any registrants, all other provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, including Hong Kong, have participants. Notably, a couple from Beijing, both over 100 years old, have been married for 78 years and are a celebrated example.

Perhaps retired cadres and intellectuals are more interested in this activity. Among the 600-plus registered couples, more than half are retired cadres, with 15% being intellectuals who have served in education, science and technology, and cultural sectors. Workers and farmers each account for 10%.

It is reported that cities in provinces and regions such as Henan, Heilongjiang, and Guangxi have also held similar activities, which have been well-received by elderly couples.

　　金婚佳侣评选加紧筹备　目前报名者已逾六百人
    本报讯　记者冯媛报道：尽管全国金婚佳侣评选纪念一举使有些青年不以为然，但它依然获得了老年伴侣的欢迎。记者从设在全国妇联的活动组委会了解到，四个月来已有六百多对金婚夫妇报名响应。
    据了解，这六百多对金婚夫妇中有汉族、维吾尔族、朝鲜族、蒙古族、达斡尔族、回族、白族和满族老人。除西藏自治区目前尚无报名者外，其余各省、直辖市、自治区和香港皆有。传为佳话的，是北京的一对百岁老人，他们的婚龄已有七十八年。
    也许是离休干部、知识分子对此活动更感兴趣，报名的六百多对金婚夫妇中，离休干部占了一半还多，其中在教育、科技、文化界服务的知识分子占百分之十五。工人和农民则各占百分之十。
    据悉，河南、黑龙江、广西等省、区的一些城市，也曾举办过类似活动，深受老年夫妇的欢迎。
