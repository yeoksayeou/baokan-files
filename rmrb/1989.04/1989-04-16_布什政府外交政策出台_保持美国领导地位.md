The Bush administration, after nearly three months of reviewing its foreign policy, announced today that Secretary of State Baker has proposed three principles for U.S. foreign policy in the future, with the aim of continuing to maintain America's leadership position.

Baker made these remarks at the annual meeting of the American Newspaper Publishers Association, where he elaborated on the Bush administration's foreign policy. He said that since the end of World War II, the conflicts between the two superpowers that controlled world politics no longer exist, and the tasks facing the United States today will be "more complex and subtle."

To address the changes in world politics and meet new challenges, Baker first proposed that the United States has the responsibility to lead the "free world." He said that only under the leadership of the United States can international cooperation be achieved to solve global problems.

Baker's second principle is that America's leading position must be based on realism. He summarized the third principle of U.S. foreign policy as the "cooperation of the two parties" in America.

Reviewing the foreign policy actions taken by the Bush administration since the beginning of this year, Baker said that the U.S. government has already formulated a schedule and laid the foundation for future actions.

He said that the U.S. government attaches great importance to relations with neighboring countries. The fact that President Bush met with Canadian Prime Minister Mulroney and Mexican President Salinas shortly after taking office is a testament to this.

He said that the Democrats and Republicans in the United States reached a compromise on the issue of aiding Nicaraguan anti-government forces, which is the second practical step taken by the Bush administration in its foreign policy. This action will help Central America to end years of war and gradually move towards a democratic process.

He said that the third diplomatic action taken by the Bush administration is to lay the foundation for peace and security in the Middle East. He pointed out that the new government has taken a step-by-step approach to the Middle East issue, seeking to make progress in resolving the most difficult regional conflicts. Baker also said that the Bush administration has done a lot of preparatory work to further improve East-West relations and is committed to formulating policies with Western allies.

### 布什政府外交政策出台　保持美国领导地位

　　布什政府外交政策出台
　　保持美国领导地位
    新华社华盛顿４月１４日电　布什政府在对外交政策进行近３个月的审议之后，国务卿贝克今天提出了美国今后外交政策的３点原则，其宗旨是：继续保持美国的领导地位。
    贝克是在美国报纸主编协会的年会上阐述布什政府的对外政策的。他说，由于二次大战后两个控制世界政治的超级大国之间的冲突已不复存在，美国目前所面临的任务将“更加复杂和微妙”。
    为了正视世界政治的变化和迎接新的挑战，贝克首先提出，美国有责任担当“自由世界”的带头人。他说，只有在美国的带领下，才能为解决全球性的问题进行国际合作。
    贝克提出的第二个原则是，美国的领先地位必须以现实主义为基础。他将美国外交政策的第３个原则归结为美国两党的“通力合作”。
    在回顾布什政府自今年初开始执政以来所采取的外交行动时，贝克说，美国政府已经在制订日程表和为今后的行动打下基础。
    他说，美国政府重视同邻国的关系。布什总统就职后相继会晤了加拿大总理马尔罗尼和墨西哥总统萨利纳斯就是一个明证。
    他说，美国民主和共和两党在援助尼加拉瓜反政府武装的问题上达成妥协是布什政府外交政策上采取的第２个实际步骤。这一行动将使中美洲摆脱多年来的战争并逐步走上民主进程。
    他说，布什政府采取的第３个外交行动是为中东地区的和平与安全打下一个基础。他指出，新政府在中东问题上采取了一步一步来的态度，谋求在解决这一最困难的地区冲突方面取得进展。贝克还说，布什政府已为进一步改善东西方关系作了大量的准备工作，并致力于制定美国同西方盟国的政策。
