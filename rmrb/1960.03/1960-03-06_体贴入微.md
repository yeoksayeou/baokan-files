In a few days, it will be International Women's Day on March 8th. Suddenly, many associations arose in my mind. First I thought of women, then of children, then of childcare workers and children's educators, and finally I thought of our country's care and nurturing of the next generation, and the new type of relationship between people...

These associations, though seemingly limitless, were triggered by a specific event.

There is a Huolou Street Kindergarten in Wuhan City, which is a red banner in the city's preschool education cause. The sixteen childcare workers and educators in this kindergarten devote all their energy to the noble cause of cultivating a new generation for the motherland. Like loving mothers, they care for, care about, and educate the children, nurturing over a hundred children to be lively, lovely, sensible, and healthy. In the summer heat, they make their own cool drinks to relieve the children from the heat, and use waste materials to make fans to cool the children. When the children's clothes and shoes are torn, they stay up at night to sew and mend them. They write their own vivid teaching materials, trying every means to make the new moral qualities of our era take root, sprout, and grow in the hearts of the children. In short, they are truly meticulous in their care for the new generation of the motherland. What about the parents? They are also meticulous in their care. Newly admitted children are accepted as soon as they arrive, children can be dropped off early and picked up late every day, parents with urgent tasks can leave their children in the kindergarten for temporary overnight stays, and parents can also leave their children in the kindergarten on Sundays if they have something to do. They think thoroughly and act thoroughly, wholeheartedly thinking about the parents and doing their best to help others.

The spirit of meticulous care for children and parents shown by the childcare workers of Huolou Street Kindergarten in Wuhan demonstrates their infinite love for the cause of socialist construction and for the present and future of the motherland.

Educating children well, so that the new generation of the motherland grows up healthily and becomes reliable successors to the cause of communism, is not a trivial matter, but a major one. Of China's 650 million people, young children account for one-sixth of the population. They are the new generation of our motherland, and the future cause and hope are all on them. Cultivating these children into new communist people from an early age is directly related to the future of our cause. "It takes ten years to grow a tree, but a hundred years to cultivate a person." "Growing trees" is to cultivate pillars for construction, while "cultivating people" is to cultivate even more important pillars for the socialist and communist edifice. Therefore, educating children well is a century-old plan for our cause. This is why our Party and state are so concerned about and care for the next generation; this is also why those diligent childcare workers are so concerned and caring for the children.

It is even more commendable that childcare workers take care of the production and work of parents in every possible way. Educating the next generation is originally the responsibility of the entire society, and first and foremost the responsibility of the parents. However, the childcare workers realize that by educating the children well, they can enable parents to concentrate more energy on other socialist construction undertakings. With their impetus, the broad masses of women can break free from tedious housework and become a vital force in various construction posts. They closely link their own work with our entire cause.

Everything in our country is like this. As long as it concerns the collective interest, people will care for it meticulously in all aspects. The new generation of our motherland is growing up under this meticulous care. In the past, Mr. Lu Xun once called for "saving the children" because at that time the children's bodies and minds were being stifled and could not be saved. But now, our entire society is meticulous in its care for children. This reflects the tremendous changes of the times and also reflects the tremendous changes in people's mental outlook.

Childcare workers possess a spirit of meticulous care for collective undertakings because they have a high degree of communist consciousness, a broad mind, and a long-term vision, regarding the affairs of others and the affairs of the collective as their own. Caring for the collective more than caring for the individual, caring for others more than caring for oneself, and doing so meticulously and comprehensively, is a new moral outlook, a selfless communist style. With this style, we can do anything better.

    体贴入微
    柳笛
    再过几天，就是“三八”国际劳动妇女节。我忽然产生了许多联想。先想到妇女，后想到儿童，接着又想起了保育工作者和儿童教育工作者，最后想到了我们的国家对下一代的关怀和抚育，想到了人与人之间的新型关系……。
    这些联想虽说空泛无边，但却是由一件具体事情引起的。
    武汉市有一所花楼街幼儿园，是全市幼儿教育事业的一面红旗。这个幼儿园的十六名保教人员，把自己的全部精力贯注在为祖国培养新的一代的崇高事业上。她们和慈母一样爱护孩子、关心孩子、教育孩子，把一百多个孩子培植得活泼可爱，又懂事，又健康。夏天炎热，她们自己制作清凉饮料为孩子们解暑，利用废物做成风扇给孩子们吹风。孩子们的衣服鞋袜破了，她们夜晚不睡为孩子们缝补。她们自己编写各种生动的教材，千方百计地使我们时代的新的道德品质在孩子们的心灵上生根、发芽、成长。总之，她们对祖国新的一代真是体贴入微。对于家长呢？她们也是体贴入微。新入园的儿童随到随收，儿童每天可以早送晚接，家长有突击任务，可以将孩子临时留园住宿，星期天家长有事也可以把孩子留在园内。她们想得周到，做得周到，一心一意地为家长们着想，尽自己的力量去帮助别人。
    武汉花楼街幼儿园保育工作者们对孩子、对家长这种体贴入微的精神，表现了她们对社会主义建设事业、对祖国的现在和未来，充满了无限的热爱。
    把孩子们教养好，使祖国新的一代健康地成长起来，成为共产主义事业可靠的接班人，这不是一件小事，而是一件大事。我国六亿五千万人口中，幼年儿童占了六分之一的比数。他们是我们祖国的一代新人，未来的事业和希望都在他们身上。把这些孩子们从小就培养成共产主义的新人，就直接关系到我们事业的未来。“十年树木，百年树人”，“树木”是为了培植建筑上的栋梁，“树人”则是为社会主义和共产主义大厦培植更为重要的栋梁人材。因此，教育好孩子是我们事业的百年大计。我们的党和国家对下一代如此关怀和爱护，道理就在这里；那些勤勤恳恳的保育工作者们对孩子们如此关心、体贴，道理也在这里。
    保育工作者们对家长们的生产、工作也照顾得无微不至，这种精神就更加可贵。教育下一代，本来是整个社会的责任，首先是做父母的责任。但是保育工作者们却认识到，她们把孩子教养好了，可以使家长们集中更多的精力用在其他的社会主义建设事业上，由于她们的带动，广大的妇女就可能从繁琐的家务劳动中脱身而出，充当各种建设岗位上的生力军。她们把自己的一份工作和我们整个的事业密切地连结在一起了。
    我们国家里的任何事情都是这样。只要是关系到集体利益的事情，人们就会从各方面无微不至地去关心它。我们祖国新的一代，就在这种体贴入微的关怀下成长着。当年鲁迅先生曾经呼吁过“救救孩子”，因为那时孩子们的身心被扼杀着，是不得救的。而现在，我们整个社会对孩子都是体贴入微。这反映了时代的巨变，也反映了人们精神面貌的巨变。
    保育工作者们具有对集体事业体贴入微的精神，是因为她们有高度的共产主义觉悟，胸襟开阔、目光远大，把别人的事情、集体的事情看作自己的事情。关心集体胜过关心个人，体贴别人胜过照顾自己，而且是入细入微，无所不至，这是一种新的道德面貌，是一种忘我的共产主义风格。有了这种风格，我们的任何事情都可以办得更好。
