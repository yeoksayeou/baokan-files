Combining Decentralization and Centralization, Integrating On-Site and Off-Site
Jilin Chemical Industrial Company Vigorously Engages in Comprehensive Waste Utilization
    (Our newspaper's Jilin dispatch of March 22nd) Reporter Zhao Yuqing reports: While vigorously engaging in technological revolution and increasing production capacity, Jilin Chemical Industrial Company is vigorously grasping comprehensive waste utilization, achieving remarkable results.

    Up to now, more than ten kinds of waste liquids and gases, such as thioglycolic acid waste liquid, naphthol AS filtrate, waste oleic acid, hydrochloric acid waste gas, and phosphorus mud, have been fully utilized throughout the company; dozens of wastes, such as iron mud, coke powder, calcium carbide slag, coal ash, and carbon dioxide gas, have been partially utilized; in addition, twenty-seven waste utilization research projects have been completed.

    This company discharges tens of thousands of tons of waste gas, waste liquid, and waste residue every day, containing a large amount of chemical raw materials such as acids, alkalis, benzene, naphthalene, and phenols. Therefore, comprehensive utilization is an important task for modern large-scale chemical enterprises. However, in the past, due to an unclear understanding of the comprehensive utilization of waste, some people thought: "To gain something, one must lose something"; others, although believing that these substances could theoretically be recycled and utilized, felt that the technology was difficult and the equipment complex, and it could not be done all at once. Therefore, comprehensive utilization work has not been carried out. Since the great leap in technological innovation, the masses' daring and willing to work style has given people profound enlightenment. At the same time, the realization of many innovation projects has also made the demand for chemical raw materials inside and outside the factory more urgent. Facing such a situation, the Party Committee of this company comprehensively discussed the work of comprehensive utilization; according to the principles of batch utilization, combining decentralized utilization with centralized utilization, combining on-site and off-site utilization, combining indigenous and foreign methods, combining chemical and physical methods, and adapting to local conditions, a comprehensive utilization plan was formulated. At the same time, the company's employees were called upon to "seize treasures from waste." Then a mass movement of vigorously engaging in technological innovation and comprehensive utilization was launched vigorously.

    The fact that this company has carried out comprehensive waste utilization work proves that most wastes can be utilized. For example, small pieces of calcium carbide and calcium carbide powder produced in the production process of the company's calcium carbide plant have always been discarded as waste; after many experiments, workers have recently successfully researched and used it to replace good calcium carbide to produce expensive acetic acid and calcium cyanamide, so that thousands of tons of small pieces of calcium carbide and calcium carbide powder are all utilized, creating a value of several million yuan each year. In the past, Jilin Dye Factory discharged huge amounts of aminophenyl methyl ether waste liquid into the Songhua River. Now it is used to extract sodium sulfide, with an annual output of 1,500 tons, becoming an important raw material for the dye industry and paper industry.

    The widespread development of comprehensive utilization has recovered a large amount of raw materials. The An'anlan workshop of Jilin Dye Factory uses methoxy orange fragrant oleic acid waste filtrate as raw material to produce An'anlan, which can save 2,400 tons of refined salt every year. The aniline workshop reuses aniline wastewater for production, recovering 160 tons of aniline, an important raw material for dyes and dye intermediates, every year. The carbon dioxide gas recovered by Jilin Fertilizer Plant can produce 20,000 tons of soda ash and 50,000 to 80,000 tons of urea annually. The acetic acid workshop of Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant recovers a large amount of mercury from the emissions, accounting for more than half of the mercury used in this workshop. This greatly saves raw materials.

    Comprehensive utilization not only opened up a source of raw materials, but also increased the production of a variety of new products. At present, Jilin Dye Factory has formally produced and trial-produced dozens of products such as sodium sulfide, chlorosulfonic acid, carbon black, zinc oxide, zinc carbonate, tanning agents, soil conditioners, indanthrene gray and brown, etc., using various waste liquids. Jilin Fertilizer Plant recovered carbon dioxide to produce calcium carbonate, a raw material for toothpaste, and extracted higher alcohols such as isobutanol and isoamyl alcohol, which have never been produced in China, from waste isobutyl oil discharged from the methanol production process. The steel materials plant affiliated to the company also successfully trial-produced high-grade cement using calcium carbide slag and coke powder from the calcium carbide plant; and used coke powder, lime powder (made into pellets), and pyrite slag to replace coke, limestone, and ore to smelt pig iron.

    After comprehensive utilization, it also provided abundant raw materials for local chemical industries. Jilin Dye Factory has transferred more than ten kinds of wastes, such as pyrite slag, iron mud, zinc carbonate slag, and sulfuric acid waste liquid, in batches to dozens of industrial production units in Changchun, Jilin, Siping, Shenyang, Andong, and other places, as well as people's communes in Jiaohe, Yongji, and other places to produce chemical products such as fertilizers, pesticides, paints, and dyes.

    At present, the comprehensive waste utilization work of this company is developing healthily and rapidly from small-scale utilization to large-scale utilization, from partial utilization to comprehensive utilization, and from extracting ordinary products to extracting high-grade products.

    分散和集中相结合  厂内和厂外相结合
    吉林化学工业公司大搞废物综合利用
    本报吉林22日电　记者赵玉庆报道：吉林化学工业公司在大闹技术革命提高生产能力的同时，大抓废物综合利用，获得了显著的效果。
    到目前为止，全公司已有硫酤酸废液、萘酚ＡＳ滤液、废油酸、盐酸废气、磷泥等十余种废液废气充分利用起来；有铁泥、焦炭粉、电石渣、煤灰、二氧化碳气等几十种废物部分地利用起来；此外还完成了二十七项废物利用的研究项目。
    这个公司每天排出数以万吨计的废气、废液、废渣，其中含有大量酸、碱、苯、萘、酚等化工原料。因此综合利用是现代化大型化工企业的一项重要任务。但是，在过去，由于对废物的综合利用认识不明确，如有人认为：“有所得，必有所失”；有的人虽然认为这些物质在理论上有可能回收利用，但是又认为技术困难，设备复杂，不能一下子办到。因此，综合利用工作，一直没有搞起来。大闹技术革新以来，群众敢想敢干的风格给了人们深刻的启示。同时，许多革新项目的实现，厂内外对化工原料的要求也更加迫切了。面对这样的形势，这个公司的党委会全面讨论了综合利用的工作；根据分批利用、分散利用和集中利用相结合、厂内厂外利用相结合、土法和洋法相结合、化学方法与物理方法相结合，以及因地制宜等原则，制订了综合利用的规划。同时，向全公司职工提出了向“废物夺宝”的号召。接着一个大闹技术革新大搞综合利用的群众运动就轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。
    这个公司开展废物综合利用工作的事实证明：大部分废物可以利用。例如，公司所属电石厂生产过程中产生的小块电石和电石粉末，一向被当作废物扔掉；工人们经过多次试验，最近研究成功用它代替好电石生产价值昂贵的醋酸和氰氨化钙，使产生的成千吨小块电石和电石粉末全部得到利用，每年创造的价值可达数百万元。吉林染料厂过去把数量巨大的氨基苯甲醚废液排入松花江，现在被用来提取硫化碱，年产量可达一千五百吨，成为染料工业和造纸工业的重要原料。
    综合利用的普遍开展，回收了大量的原料。吉林染料厂安安兰车间利用甲氧基橙芳油酸废滤液作原料生产安安兰，每年可节约二千四百吨精盐。苯胺车间把苯胺废水重新用于生产，每年回收染料和染料中间体的重要原料苯胺一百六十吨。吉林肥料厂回收的二氧化碳气体，可年产二万吨纯碱和五万至八万吨尿素。吉林电石厂醋酸车间从排出物中回收大量的汞，占这个车间用汞量的一半以上。这样就大大节约了原料。
    综合利用，不仅开辟了原料来源，而且还增产了多种新产品。目前，吉林染料厂已用各种废液正式生产和试生产了硫化碱、氯磺酸、炭黑、氧化锌、碳酸锌、柔革剂、土壤改良剂、阴丹士林灰和棕等数十种产品。吉林肥料厂回收二氧化碳生产了牙膏原料碳酸钙，从甲醇生产过程排出的废异丁基油当中提取了国内从未生产过的异丁醇、异戊醇等高级醇类。公司所属钢铁材料厂还利用电石厂的电石渣和焦炭粉试制成功了高标号水泥；利用焦炭粉、石灰粉（作成团矿）和硫铁矿渣，分别代替焦炭、石灰石和矿石炼出了生铁。
    综合利用以后，还给地方化学工业提供了丰富的原料。吉林染料厂把硫铁矿渣、铁泥、碳酸锌渣、硫酸废液等十余种废物，已分批调拨给长春、吉林、四平、沈阳、安东等地的数十个工业生产单位以及蛟河、永吉等地人民公社生产肥料、农药、涂料、染料等化工产品。
    目前这个公司的废物综合利用工作，正由小批利用向大批利用、由部分利用向全面利用、由提取普通产品向提取高级产品的方向健康、迅速地发展。
