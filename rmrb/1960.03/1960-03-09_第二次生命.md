     Second Life
    Wu Lü
    All sixty-one class brothers who suffered food poisoning in the "Pinglu Incident" have fully recovered and are back on the construction site, full of vigor! The Party is relieved, the comrades of the Ministry of Health and the doctors of Pinglu County are relieved, the commercial workers of the Beijing Bamiancao Special Drug Store and the Wuzhou Electrical Appliance Store are relieved, the old boatmen who smashed through the waves and crossed the Yellow River at night and the air force soldiers who pierced the clouds and airdropped divine medicine are relieved, and everyone who cares about the "Pinglu Incident" is relieved. The superior socialist system and the lofty communist spirit finally rescued these sixty-one poisoned class brothers from danger.

    Now, the sixty-one class brothers who have been resurrected are displaying their power. It seems that the iron hoe has become lighter and the loess has become softer. The average daily work efficiency per person has increased from five cubic meters to fourteen cubic meters. This is not simply an increase in quantity, but it contains a new qualitative leap. Here, our class brothers are deeply moved by their even deeper feelings for the Party, the people, and the socialist motherland. The noblest communist spirit of mankind has given these sixty-one class brothers, who were on the verge of death, a second life; in these new lives, the communist spirit bursts out with even more dazzling fire.

    Life happens only once. However, the sixty-one class brothers who suffered food poisoning in the "Pinglu Incident" have all had a second life. This new life was cultivated by the sunshine of the Party. Not only these sixty-one class brothers, not only the 120,000 people in Pinglu County and millions of people all over the country who were touched by this new song of communist triumph, but every one of us who consciously fights for the cause of socialism and communism has two lives. From individualism to collectivism, from the bourgeois worldview to the proletarian worldview, and from the exploiting class to the self-reliant laborers, from "ghosts" to human beings, etc., are all transformations of life.

    Life is precious. Since ancient times, everyone has cherished their own life. However, not everyone understands the meaning of life. What is greatness and what is insignificance? People influenced by different classes and different ideas have never had a common language. Some people live only for themselves, while others live for the lofty cause of communism. Some die as light as a feather or leave a legacy of infamy, while others are as heavy as Mount Tai and will be immortalized. For some, life is merely the cruel exploitation of others; for others, it is just a room, a book, a narrow world; for communists, life is a bullet that, together with thousands of other bullets, shatters the old world; it is a steel bar that, together with thousands of other steel bars, builds a new socialist and communist edifice. This is immortal life, the brilliance of eternal life. The lives of those who rescued the poisoning victims of the "Pinglu Incident" and the lives of those who were rescued in the "Pinglu Incident" all shine with the light of such life.

     第二次生命
    吴滤
    “平陆事件”中六十一名食物中毒的阶级弟兄完全恢复健康，一个个精神抖擞地重返工地了！党放心了，卫生部的同志们和平陆县的医生们放心了，北京八面槽特种药品商店和五洲电料行的商业工作者们放心了，击碎巨浪、夜渡黄河的老船工和穿云破雾、空投神药的空军战士们放心了，一切关心“平陆事件”的人都放心了。优越的社会主义制度，崇高的共产主义精神，终于把这六十一名中毒的阶级弟兄从危急中抢救出来了。
    现在，六十一名死而复生的阶级弟兄施展出他们的威力，好像是铁镢变得更轻了，黄土变得更软了，每人每天的平均工效从五方提高到十四方。这不简单是量的增加，这里包含着新的质的飞跃，这里都激动着我们的阶级弟兄对于党、对于人民、对于社会主义祖国更加深厚的感情。人类最高贵的共产主义精神，给了这六十一名危在旦夕的阶级弟兄以第二次生命；在这些新的生命中，共产主义精神迸发出更加耀眼的火光。
    生命只有一次。但是，“平陆事件”中六十一名食物中毒的阶级弟兄都有了第二次生命。这新的生命，是党的阳光培养出来的。不只是这六十一个阶级弟兄，不只是被这又一曲共产主义凯歌扣动心弦的十二万平陆县人民和千千万万全国各地的人民，我们每一个自觉地为社会主义和共产主义事业奋斗的战士，都有两次生命。从个人主义到集体主义、从资产阶级的世界观到无产阶级的世界观，以及从剥削阶级到自食其力的劳动者、从“鬼”变人，等等，都是生命的转变。
    生命是宝贵的。自古以来，人人都珍惜自己的生命。但是，并不是每一个人都了解生命的意义。什么是伟大，什么是渺小？不同阶级和不同思想影响的人，从来就没有共同的语言。活着，有人只是为了自己，有人是为了崇高的共产主义事业。死去，有的轻如鸿毛或遗臭万年，有的重如泰山和永垂不朽。生命对于有些人说来，只是残酷地剥削别人；对于另一些人说来，只是一间房、一本书、一个窄小的天地；对于共产主义者说来，生命是一颗子弹，它同千万颗子弹一起去粉碎旧的世界；是一根钢筋，它同千万根钢筋一起建筑新的社会主义和共产主义的大厦。这才是不朽的生命，永生的光辉。抢救“平陆事件”中毒者的人们的生命，和在“平陆事件”中被抢救出来的人们的生命中，都闪耀着这样的生命的光辉。
