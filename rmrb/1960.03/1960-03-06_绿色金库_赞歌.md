   Ode to the "Green Treasury"
    Wang Lei
    Finding a "Magic Axe"
    The banks of the lower reaches of the Futun River are covered with boundless forests, like a green ocean, with no beginning or end. No one can calculate exactly how much forest there is. People praise this beautiful and rich place as the "Green Treasury."
    It is said that the "Green Treasury" has been a human secret for many years. People know it contains endless treasures, but they cannot find a way to open the door to the treasury. In the past, people wanted to use the power of a "magic axe" to split it open. Of course, fantasy is impossible to realize.
    More than a year ago, the forest farmers in this area really found a "magic axe." This "magic axe" is the People's Commune. The People's Commune united more than 4,000 households and more than 30,000 people from Laizhou, Wangtai, Xihou, and other places along the lower reaches of the Futun River into a single entity, a single rope, a single heart, like a "magic axe." Relying on this "magic axe," people have opened up the "Green Treasury," which had been closed for thousands of years, in less than two years, turning poor mountains into rich mountains and dead treasures into living treasures.
    Enemies Become Relatives
    In the past, there was a stream from Wangtai Town to Xihou Village, and a moving story was passed down on both sides of the stream: In the past, this stream was the common lifeline of the people, but thousands of households were not connected in their hearts. Whenever timber was floated, they would always compete and quarrel. As a result, the riverbed was blocked, the living water became a dead river, and neighbors became enemies. Xihou Village and Jingke Village were originally adjacent to each other, but a quarrel led to "the Cao (Jingke Village) and Wei (Xihou Village) surnames not intermarrying for a hundred years." After the cooperativization, people's relationships underwent many changes, but the problem was not fundamentally solved. After communization, the foundation of private ownership was further broken, changing people's thinking, and making the thousands of households along the stream united as one, so that the stream truly became a source of happiness for the people. The thousands of poor forest farmers along the stream have generally become prosperous and happy families. The Cao and Wei surnames, who had vowed not to intermarry, have also formed fifteen new couples, and people greet each other as "relatives."
    Changes in Xihou Village
    The changes in Xihou Village are a testimony to the new history. Since the establishment of the commune, this small village has achieved bumper harvests in agriculture and forestry for two consecutive years. Last year's achievements were the most outstanding in history. The average yield of grain per mu reached 808 jin, which is more than five times the yield per mu before liberation, and more than double that of 1958. The average grain output per capita in the village has exceeded 2,000 jin. Xihou Village is a famous high-yield forest area in Fujian. The state and the commune have established forest farms and logging factories here to develop these treasures, and built modern transportation facilities - forest small railways and highways, completely changing the backward state of "grass on the mountains and treasures below the mountains" in the past.
    The high-speed development of agricultural and forestry production has brought about great changes in the lives and mental outlook of the 300 forest farmers. Commune cadres calculated an income account for more than 300 households, showing an increase of four and a half times in ten years. The Wei Naihua family of four had a total income of 360 yuan in 1957 when it was a high-level cooperative, and the income increased to 525 yuan in 1959. Now, almost all households, large and small, in the village have money in the bank.
    In the past, the impression of Xihou Village was: narrow streets and not clean enough. Now, looking at it, it has completely changed. The streets and alleys are swept clean, and there is no cow dung or garbage to be found. The mountain slopes around the village have been cut neatly, and a large number of fruit seedlings such as tangerines, pears, and peaches have been planted, which will gradually form a beautiful ring-shaped orchard around the village in a few years. New trees have also been planted along the roads, streams, and streets. People have a wish: to turn Xihou into a forest area park with fruit trees, fragrance, greenery, and shade.
    Visiting the "King of the Forest"
    In Xihou Village, we also met the nationally renowned "King of the Forest." The throne of the "King of the Forest" is located about three kilometers from Xihou in Ancaoxia, covering an area of 50 mu, with an average of about 110 mature trees per mu. Now the average yield per mu is 78 cubic meters, and each tree is thick, straight, and about 30 meters high. It is said that it was a densely planted experimental forest successfully built by three forest farmers in Xihou Village 38 years ago, and it was a pearl buried for many years. Two years ago, the Ministry of Forestry held a national forestry on-site meeting here to promote the experience here to the whole country.
    In order to promote the experience of high-yield forests in Xihou, the Nanping Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Commune Party Committee have carried out universal experiments since the year before last. From the Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee to the leading cadres of the commune and brigade, they have personally planted fast-growing and high-yield experimental forests. In the past two years, under the direct leadership of the Party Committee, cultivating fast-growing and high-yield forests has become a mass movement for the entire commune. This spring, the commune has cultivated a total of 15,000 mu of fast-growing and high-yield forests. Many "mantou" (馒头) mountains or mountain ridges have been set up with colorful arches, with the words "Elderly Centenarian Forest," "'March 8th' Women's Forest," and "Secretary Command Forest" written on the arches. People can see at a glance that a forestry science research movement is being carried out here.
    "Flying Eagles" in the Dalong Mountain Area
    In order to develop the treasures of the "Green Treasury," the forestry department has specially established a large logging site here, and transferred many forestry workers and modern logging tools from other places. The workers fought day and night in the deep mountains, dense forests and cliffs, increasing the construction timber for the country.
    The Dalong Mountain we visited is one of the logging site's work areas. This work area has already started using chainsaws for logging, and the gathering of timber mainly relies on slides, aerial cableways, and wooden rail flatcars. The wooden rail is about five li long, connecting to the small railway at the foot of the mountain, and directly to the forest area on the mountain. From a distance, it looks like a headless giant python, crossing mountains and ridges, and going straight up. The workers transporting wood push the flatcars, following the track, slowly descending, the wheels laboriously turning forward, making a piercing creaking sound. It is said that the technique of mastering the flatcars is relatively high, and loading and operating the cars must be done by experts. The slightest negligence can lead to overturning. The wooden rail leads to the top of the mountain, passing through fourteen large and small mountain gullies, the deepest reaching 30 meters, and the shallowest also about 10 meters. Each mountain gully has a light wooden bridge made by the workers themselves. The deputy director of the logging site who accompanied us to the site told us: People call forestry workers "flying eagles." Without the ability to climb mountains and cross ridges, they cannot be forestry workers. He said: This kind of wooden bridge is a unique creation in the history of bridge construction in our country, simple and easy to build, without bridge foundations, and without a single iron nail, you can build wooden bridges of three or five layers. At the same time, this kind of bridge will not fall if it sways, and it is easier to fall if it does not move. He also led us to visit a three-story wooden bridge as high as 30 meters. It was indeed as he said, the lowest layer of wooden supports were all supported on the ground and at the foot of the mountain, and the supports of the second and third layers were sharpened with an axe and embedded in the bowl-shaped small holes in the beams of the bridge. The piers are shaped like the character "人" (ren - person), and the junctions of the two pillars are tied with bamboo strips. The bridge body is large at the bottom and small at the top, and the highest layer can only accommodate one flatcar.
    This made us deeply feel: Forestry workers are indeed "flying eagles." In order to develop the wealth of the mountainous areas and meet the needs of socialist construction, they have traveled all over the deep mountains and dense forests. What a glorious position this is!

   “绿色金库”赞歌
    王磊
    找到一把“神斧”
    富屯溪下游两岸，尽是漫无边际的森林，像绿色的海洋，看不见头，摸不着底，它到底有多少森林，谁也无法算得出来。人们称赞这个美丽富饶的地方为“绿色金库”。
    据说，“绿色金库”在许多年来一直是人间的秘密，人们知道它藏着无穷无尽的财宝，就是无法打开入库的门路。在过去，人们曾想借“神斧”之力把它劈开。当然，幻想是不可能实现的。
    一年多以前，这一带的林农真的找到一把“神斧”，这把“神斧”就是人民公社。人民公社把富屯溪下游两岸的莱州、王台、溪后等地四千多户、三万多人结成一个整体、一股绳、一条心，就像一把“神斧”。人们靠了这把“神斧”，只用不到两年的时间就把封闭了千百年的“绿色金库”劈开了，使穷山变成富山、死宝变成活宝。
    冤家变成亲家
    过去，从王台镇到溪后村，有一条溪流，溪的两岸流传着一件动人的故事：过去，这条溪是人们的共同命脉，可是千家万户的心连不在一起，每逢流放木材的时候，总要争先恐后，吵嘴打架。结果，溪床被梗塞了，活水变成了死河，睦邻变成了冤家。溪后村和井窠村原是毗邻相处，因为一场争吵，酿成“曹（井窠村）魏（溪后村）两姓百年互不通婚”。合作化以后，人们的关系有了很多变化，但没有根本解决问题。公社化后进一步打破了私有经济基础，改变了人们的思想，使沿溪千户人家结成一条心，溪流真正变成人们幸福的源泉。原来沿溪两岸千户贫苦的林农，普遍变成康乐人家。立誓互不通婚的曹魏两姓，还结成十五对新的夫妇，人们相见互以“亲家”相称。
    溪后村的变迁
    溪后村的变迁就是新的历史的见证。办起公社以来，这个小村连续两年获得农林业大丰收，去年的成绩是历史上最突出的一年，粮食平均亩产量达到八百零八斤，等于解放前亩产量的五倍多，比1958年也增加一倍多，全村每口人粮食平均产量已经超过两千斤。溪后村是闻名福建的高产林区，国家和公社为了开发这些财富，在这里建立了林场、伐木厂，兴办了现代化交通——森林小铁路和公路，彻底改变了过去“山上是草、山下是宝”的落后状态。
    农林业生产的高速度发展，使三百户林农的生活面貌和精神面貌发生了很大的变化。公社干部给三百多户人家算了一笔收入账，十年共增长了四倍半。社员魏乃华全家四口人，1957年高级社时共收入三百六十元，1959年收入增加到五百二十五元。现在，全村大小户人家，差不多都在银行存了钱。
    以前，溪后村给人的印象是：街道狭窄，也不够干净。现在，走进一看，已经面貌全非了，大街小巷打扫得干干净净，找不到一点牛粪、垃圾。村庄周围的山壤劈得整整齐齐，栽下柑桔、梨、桃等大批果苗，几年之后将逐渐形成一个美丽的环村果园。路旁、溪旁、街旁也栽了新树。人们都有一种愿望：一定要把溪后变成一座果化、香化、绿化、林荫化的林区公园。
    拜访“森林之王”
    我们在溪后村，还见了闻名全国的“森林之王”。“森林之王”的宝座距溪后约三公里的安曹下，面积共五十亩，平均每亩有成材林一百一十株左右，现在平均亩产七十八立方米，株株长得粗壮笔挺，高达三十米左右。据说，它是三十八年前由溪后村的三户林农营造成功的密植试验林，是埋没了多年的一颗明珠。前年，林业部曾在这里召开过一次全国林业现场会议，向全国推广这里的经验。
    中共南平市委和公社党委为了推广溪后的丰产林经验，从前年开始进行了普遍试验，从市委书记到公社、大队领导干部都亲自种了速成、丰产试验林。近两年来，在党委直接领导下，栽培速成丰产林已经成为全社性的群众运动。今年春季全社已造速成、丰产林面积达一万五千亩，许多“馒头”山上或者山垠都搭起彩色拱门，拱门上写着：“老年百岁林”、“‘三八’妇女林”、“书记指挥林”等字样。人们一眼即可看出，这里正在开展一个林业科学研究运动。
    大垅山区的“飞鹰”
    为了把“绿色金库”的宝藏开发出来，林业部门特地在这里建立了一个较大的采伐场，从外地调来许多林业工人和现代化采伐工具。工人们夜以继日地战斗在深山密林和悬崖峭壁上，为国家增加建设用材。
    我们访问过的大垅山就是采伐场的工区之一。这个工区采伐木材已经开始使用油锯，集材主要靠滑道、架空索道和木轨平车。木轨道长约五华里，山下与小铁路相接，山上直通森林地带，远远望去，像一条无头的巨蟒、穿山越岭，直贯而上。运材的工人们推着平车，顺着轨道，徐徐下行，车轮吃力地向前转动，发出刺耳的吱吱声。据说，掌握平车的技术较高，装车、操车都要内行，稍有疏忽，就有翻车的危险。木轨道通向山巅，共经过十四道大小山沟，最深处达三十米，浅处也有十米左右，每一道山沟都有工人自制的轻便木桥。陪我们到工地的采伐场副场长对我们说：人们叫林业工人是“飞鹰”，没有翻山越岭的本领，不能当林业工人。他说：这种木桥是我国架桥史上的独特创造，简便易造，不打桥基，不用一支铁钉，就可造起三层五层的木桥来。同时，这种桥摇摆就不会倒，不动才容易倒。他还领我们参观了一座高达三十米的三层木桥，的确像他说的，最低一层的木支柱都在平地上和山脚下支着，二层和三层的支柱用斧头削尖，嵌在桥的横梁的碗形小孔中。桥墩像“人”字形，两柱相接处，用竹篾捆绑。桥身底层大、上层小，最高一层只容一辆平车行走。
    这使我们深深感到：林业工人的确是“飞鹰”。为了开发山区财富，满足社会主义建设需要，他们走遍了深山密林之间，这是多么光荣的岗位啊！
