To Prevent Seedling Rot and Ensure Good Early Rice Planting
Changde in Hunan and Yancheng in Jiangsu Vigorously Grasp the Seedling Stage

Changsha Dispatch from our newspaper on March 6th: In order to bring forward the double-cropping early rice planting time and strive for a bumper harvest of double-cropping rice, Changde County in Hunan Province is taking solid measures to prepare covering materials for the seedling fields in every possible way to resolve the contradiction of early planting and easy seedling rot. At present, about 15 "dan" of covering material per "mu" has been prepared for the county's 90,000 "mu" of seedling fields.

"Start planting soon after Jingzhe, avoid planting too late after Qingming, planting at the Spring Equinox is just right," is a new experience summed up by the farmers of Changde County during the two years of the Great Leap Forward. Bringing forward the planting time from "Qingming" in the past to the Spring Equinox is an important condition for striving for high yields of double-cropping rice. According to this important experience, this year's early rice in this county is planned to be sown before the Spring Equinox, and efforts will be made to complete the transplanting before Grain Rain. In this way, early rice can be harvested before the Xiaoshu solar term, so that all late rice can be transplanted before the Dashu solar term, realizing that late rice comprehensively surpasses early rice, and achieving a double-cropping bumper harvest. However, according to this plan, the solar term for sowing this year is one month earlier than the old habits, and one week earlier than last year. Moreover, it is a comprehensive advancement, and in order to increase grain production even more, the double-cropping rice has been expanded from 510,000 "mu" last year to 850,000 "mu" this year, and the corresponding increase of more than 30,000 "mu" of seedling fields have poorer wind-sheltered and sun-facing conditions than the old seedling fields. Therefore, after the advance sowing, how to overcome the phenomenon of large-scale seedling rot that may occur under the invasion of cold air has become an important key to be solved urgently in the current spring plowing work of this county. Based on past experience, the Changde County Party Committee believes that as long as the moist seedling fields are fully promoted and sufficient covering materials are prepared for heat preservation, the seedlings can be ensured not to be afraid of cold waves, and a large amount of labor force for temporary seedling protection during the arrival of cold waves can also be saved. Therefore, the county party committee put forward the slogan of grasping covering materials like breaking through the fertilizer barrier, and launched a mass movement to prepare covering materials for seedling fields in the county as early as possible.

In order to prepare enough covering materials for seedling fields, all kinds of plant ash and rice husk ash originally stored have been widely collected. They are stored in special sheds, managed by special personnel, and used under control. The green manure requires heat-preserving ash, and vegetable gardens and economic crops use ash, mobilizing the masses to burn soil ash to replace them, so that the contradiction between seedling fields and spring-ripening crops competing for ash is properly resolved.

All localities have assigned the task of preparing covering materials to canteens, households, factories, mines, and organizations, and regularly assigned special personnel to collect them. After the tasks were assigned, all localities combined production and the use of spare time to widely carry out activities such as sweeping fallen leaves, shoveling weeds, pulling rice stubble, replacing thatched roofs, and cutting tall melons for burning ash. More than 20,000 people in the Jinxia Commune are engaged in these activities, and the 498 newly built ash sheds are filled with plant ash. Now in the whole county, weeds in front of and behind houses, on the edges of fields and roads, and tall melons in ponds have been cleared, which has not only obtained a large amount of covering materials, but also combined this movement to carry out a large-scale annihilation of overwintering pests.

Nanjing Dispatch from our newspaper on March 6th: Under the encouragement of the slogan "Leap out of Yancheng and catch up with Jiangnan," Yancheng County in Jiangsu Province, is grasping the early rice seedling raising link, taking revolutionary measures, and trying every possible means to increase temperature and prevent cold, cultivate strong seedlings, prevent seedling rot, and strive for the first victory of early rice this year.

Yancheng County has about 500,000 "mu" of paddy fields, with one crop of rice a year. Most of these fields are planted with early rice. This year, the county plans to plant more than 300,000 "mu" of early rice, an expansion of more than 60,000 "mu" compared with last year. The early rice area accounts for more than 30% of the total rice field area. The stubble of the paddy fields is early, but because the paddy fields have been soaked in water for a long time, the soil is cold and the ground temperature rises slowly. In the past, planting seedlings in this kind of field not only grew slowly, but also often caused seedling rot, which often affected the planting area of early rice. In order to solve the problem of early rice seedling rot and cultivate strong seedlings, the Yancheng County Party Committee held a forum with farmers, technicians, and leading cadres in the "Little Jiangnan," a pacesetter in catching up with Jiangnan, summarized the experience of cultivating strong seedlings and preventing seedling rot over the years, found the root cause of seedling rot, and proposed a plan for a seedling pool revolution to the whole county. It was decided to carry out a large-scale relocation of seedling pools and increase temperature and prevent cold. All 40,000 "mu" of early rice seedling pools in the county were selected in high fields with strong warmth, fertile soil, and sheltered from the wind and facing the sun. While carrying out the large-scale relocation of seedling fields, various localities have also formulated a variety of methods to keep the small seedlings warm in view of the characteristics of the low temperature when early rice seedlings are planted. Some are to set up a 3 "mu" or more water storage field for every 10 "mu" of seedling pool, fill it with water in the morning, and let the sun shine to warm it up, and irrigate it into the seedling pool at night to keep it warm. Some are to establish wind-proof enclosures. Each seedling pool has a wind-proof enclosure that is 1.5 "chi" wide at the bottom, 8 "cun" wide at the top, and more than 1 "chi" high. Foil is inserted around the seedling field to prevent wind and prevent chickens and ducks from ruining it. Some are to improve the soil. Where seedling pools are made in the fields, first spread the surface soil that has been fumigated and burned, and then deeply plow it. This not only eliminates pests and weeds, but also increases soil temperature.

In order to ensure the comprehensive implementation of the revolutionary measures of the seedling pool, all communes have established professional teams to manage the seedling pool, mainly composed of party members and league members, and absorbing some experienced commune members for special training, professional management, and implementing the "five fixed" responsibility system of fixed person, fixed field, fixed time, fixed task, and fixed remuneration.

    防止烂秧插好早稻
    湖南常德江苏盐城大抓秧苗关
    本报长沙6日电　湖南省常德县为了提早双季早稻播种的时间，争取双季稻大丰收，正在采取扎实的措施，千方百计的准备秧田覆盖物，以解决提早播种、容易烂秧的矛盾。现在，全县九万亩秧田，每亩已准备十五担左右的覆盖物。
    “惊蛰早、清明迟，春分播种正当时”，这是常德县农民在两年大跃进中总结出来的新经验。把过去“清明”播种提早到春分播种，是争取双季稻高产的一个重要条件。根据这条重要经验，今年这个县的早稻，计划在春分前播种，争取在谷雨前插完秧。这样早稻就可在小暑节前收割完，使全部晚稻都抢在大暑节前插下，实现晚稻全面超早稻，双季大丰收。但是，根据这个计划，今年播种的节气比旧习惯提早了一个月，比去年也提早一个星期。而且又是全面提早，加以为了更多地增加粮食生产，今年的双季稻又由去年的五十一万亩扩大到了八十五万亩，与此相适应地增加的三万多亩秧田，避风向阳条件都比老秧田差。因此在提前播种后，如何克服在寒流的侵袭下，可能出现大批烂秧的现象，就成了这个县当前备耕工作中急须解决的一个重要关键。中共常德县委根据以往的经验，认为只要全部推广湿润秧田，准备充足的覆盖物保温，就可以确保秧苗不怕寒潮侵袭，也可节省在寒潮到来时临时护秧的大批劳动力。因此县委提出了像破肥关一样地抓覆盖物的口号，及早在全县发动了一个为秧田准备覆盖物的群众运动。
    为了准备足够的秧田覆盖物，各地均将原来存有的草木灰、谷壳灰广泛进行了收集。专棚储藏，专人保管，控制使用。绿肥需要的保温灰、菜园和经济作物用灰，发动群众大烧火土灰代替，这样妥善地解决了秧田和春熟作物争灰的矛盾。
    各地都把准备覆盖物的任务分配到了食堂、户、厂矿、机关团体，定期专人收集。任务分配后，各地均结合生产和利用业余时间，广泛开展了扫落叶、铲杂草、拔禾蔸、换屋茅草、砍高瓜等烧灰的活动。金霞公社从事这些活动的达两万人以上，新盖的四百九十八个灰棚均盛满了草木灰。全县现在有六个公社的屋前屋后、田边路旁的杂草，塘里高瓜均已搞光，既获得了大量的覆盖物，又结合这个运动对越冬害虫来了一次大歼灭。
    本报南京6日电　江苏省盐城县，在“跳出盐城赶江南”口号的鼓舞下，抓住早稻育秧环节，采取革命措施，千方百计增温防寒，培育壮秧，防止烂秧，争取今年早稻首战胜利。
    盐城县有五十万亩左右的沤田，一年种一熟水稻，这些田又大部分种植早稻，今年全县计划种早稻三十多万亩，比去年扩大六万多亩，早稻面积占整个稻田面积30％以上。沤田茬口早，但是由于沤田长期泡在水里，土性凉，地温上升慢，过去在这种田下秧，不仅生长慢，而且常常发生烂秧现象，往往影响早稻的种植面积。为了解决早稻烂秧，育好壮秧，中共盐城县委在赶江南的标兵——“小江南”专门召开了有农民、技术人员、领导干部三结合的座谈会，总结了历年来培育壮秧，防止烂秧的经验，找出了烂秧的病根子，向全县提出了秧池大革命的方案。决定大搞秧池大搬家，增温防寒，全县四万亩早稻秧池，全部选择在暖性强、土质肥沃、背风向阳的高田里。在进行秧田大搬家的同时，各地还针对早稻下秧时气温较低的特点，订出了多种多样方法，给小秧保暖。有的是每十亩秧池设一块三亩以上的蓄水田，早晨上足水，给阳光照晒取暖，晚上灌入秧池保温。有的是建立防风圩，每块秧池做一条底宽一尺五寸，顶宽八寸，高达一尺以上的挡风圩，秧田四周围插好箔子；做到既防风，又防鸡、鸭糟塌。有的是改良土壤，凡在场巷做秧池的，则先铺上经过熏烧的表土，再行深翻。这样既消灭虫害杂草，又增加土壤温度。
    为了保证秧池革命性措施全面贯彻，各公社都建立了管理秧池专业队伍，以党团员为主，吸收一部分具有经验的社员进行专门训练，专业专管，实行定人、定田、定时、定任务、定报酬的一管到底的五定责任制度。　（通讯员蔡士元）
