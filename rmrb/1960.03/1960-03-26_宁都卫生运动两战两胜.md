Ningdu County, Jiangxi Province, after the national rural health work on-site conference in Jishan, Shanxi last year, launched a new high tide of health campaigns to eliminate pests and diseases, learning from and catching up with Jishan. Up to now, the county has organized two large-scale health blitzes, with more than 80,000 people participating. The county has newly built and renovated 1,653 toilets. More than 65% of the team's toilets have achieved sealed covers and harmless treatment without odor. The canteens have ensured that cooks have work clothes and masks, the canteens have boiling water, dust-proof and fly-proof equipment, and the tableware has been disinfected. Personal hygiene has also been universally achieved with "three haves", namely toothbrushes, face towels, and spittoons for every household.

In the county's vigorous campaign to eliminate pests and diseases, it adhered to putting politics in command and carrying out mass movements. The secretaries of party committees at all levels took the lead, adopting the method of party committee members contracting areas, brigade cadres contracting teams, and party members and league members contracting households, achieving unified leadership, unified planning and deployment, and unified inspection and evaluation. In the movement, health work was also closely integrated with production. The county combined water conservancy construction to build 238 dark ditches and increase the accumulation of sanitary fertilizer by more than 500 dan.

    宁都卫生运动两战两胜
    江西宁都县从去年全国农村卫生工作山西稷山现场会议后，掀起了一个“学稷山、赶稷山”大搞除害灭病卫生运动的新高潮。到目前为止，全县先后组织了两次声势浩大的卫生突击运动，计有八万多人参加。全县新建和改建厕所一千六百五十三个，65％以上小队的厕所，都做到了密封加盖，无臭、无害化处理。食堂做到了炊事人员有工作衣、有口罩，食堂有开水，有防尘、防蝇设备，食具都进行了消毒。个人卫生也普遍做到“三有”，即有牙刷、有面巾，户户有痰盂。
    全县在大搞除害灭病运动中，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动。各级党委书记挂帅，采取了党委委员包片，大队干部包小队，党团员包到户的办法，做到了统一领导，统一计划布置，统一检查评比。在运动中，并将卫生工作紧密结合生产进行。这个县结合兴修水利，修阴沟二百三十八条，增积卫生肥五百多担。
