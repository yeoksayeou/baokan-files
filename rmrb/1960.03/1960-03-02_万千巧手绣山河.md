　　Myriad Skilled Hands Embroider Mountains and Rivers

　　Embroidery is a unique skill of Chinese working women. Embroidered landscapes are vivid and lifelike; embroidered figures are realistic. Truly worthy of the name, "marvel of workmanship!"

　　However, in the past, women's embroidery was mostly stifled in narrow confines, unable to see the sun and moon, unable to see the light. Moreover, the things they encountered every day were just needles and threads. The torrent of revolution broke through the feudal shackles, and the broad masses of working women stepped out of their small worlds, sharing the bright sunshine of the world. The objects of their embroidery are no longer a few feet of silk, nor a few yards of silk, but the boundless fields of the motherland; what they hold in their hands is no longer limited to needles and thread, but also hoes and sickles. Look, the high-yield fields planted by women in Sichuan are cultivated as meticulously as embroidery, and their yields are generally about 20 percent higher than the local average. The cotton experimental fields planted by women in Shaanxi have more than 1,000 mu with yields of over 1,000 jin per mu. How many more than ten thousand skilled hands like the women in Sichuan and Shaanxi are there among the working women of our country!

　　The working women of our country have great ambition. They want to use their skillful hands to embroider the motherland beautifully and richly. The General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes have opened up a broader world for the liberation of working women in our country. They not only have more time to participate in labor, but also have time to study technology and culture. Many women can not only operate seed drills, winnowing machines, and drive carts, but also learn to use harvesters, planters, and tractors, becoming "all-rounders." With these weapons in their hands, they can embroider whatever flowers they want, with vibrant flowers, deep roots, and luxuriant foliage.

　　At present, our country is in a new historical period of continuing in-depth socialist revolution and sustained leaps forward in socialist construction. The broad masses of rural working women should make persistent efforts, participate more actively in labor, stand at the forefront of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution, and use their own hands to embroider the fields of the socialist motherland even more beautifully and vividly. Let the industrious and courageous Chinese women embroider a glorious page in the history of socialist construction.

### 万千巧手绣山河

    万千巧手绣山河
    绣花，是我国劳动妇女的特有本领。绣山水，生龙活现；绣人物，栩栩如生。真称得起巧夺天工！
    但是，过去妇女绣花，多被窒息在狭小的天地之中，见不到日月，看不到光明。而且，每天接触到的东西，也只是针针线线。革命的巨流，冲破了封建枷锁，广大劳动妇女走出了小天地，共享人间灿烂的阳光。她们绣花的对象，不再是几尺绫罗，也不是几丈绫罗，而是祖国无边无际的田野；她们手里拿的不再仅限于针线，还有锄头和镰刀。你看，四川妇女种的丰产田，都像绣花一样地精心培育，其产量一般都高于当地平均产量百分之二十左右。陕西妇女种的棉花试验田，有一千多亩的亩产量达到千斤以上。像四川妇女和陕西妇女这样的巧手，在我国劳动妇女中又何止万千呢！
    我国劳动妇女是有伟大气魄的，她们要用巧手把祖国绣得又美丽、又富足。总路线、大跃进和人民公社，给我国劳动妇女的解放，开辟了更广阔的天地。她们不但有更多的时间参加劳动，而且有时间学习技术和文化。许多妇女不仅会摇耧、扬场、赶大车，而且学会使用收割机、播种机和拖拉机，成了“全把式”。她们手里掌握了这些武器，想绣什么花，就绣什么花，花枝鲜艳，根深叶茂。
    目前，我国正处在社会主义革命继续深入和社会主义建设持续跃进的新的历史时期。广大农村劳动妇女应当再接再厉，更积极地参加劳动，站在技术革命和文化革命的最前列，用自己的双手，把社会主义祖国的田野绣得更加美丽、更加鲜艳。让勤劳而勇敢的中国妇女，在社会主义建设的历史上，绣下光辉的一页。
