Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing Electric. The General Branch of the Communist Party of China in Workshop 35 of the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory extensively and deeply organized workers to study Chairman Mao's works, promptly cleared various ideological obstacles, and promoted the rapid development of the "Five-izations" movement (mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, semi-automation, and linkage). As of March 18, the degree of mechanization in the entire workshop had risen from 65.9% at the beginning of the year to 98.7%, 78% of the machine tools had achieved automation or semi-automation, and one linkage line had been realized. This guaranteed the overfulfillment of production tasks every ten days and every month.

When the "Five-izations" movement began in this workshop, many workers believed that "the technical level is low, and nothing significant can be achieved" and "automation is too profound and difficult to grasp." This thinking hindered the vigorous development of the movement. At this time, the Party General Branch determined to focus on "breaking superstitions and establishing great ambitions," organized all workers to study Chairman Mao's works such as "Introducing a Cooperative," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and "On Practice." Combined with discussing their learning experiences, debates were launched on issues such as "Can we achieve 'Five-izations' under our existing conditions?" This enabled workers to recognize from the "Foolish Old Man" and the ambition and amazing drive of the members of the Yingju Agricultural Cooperative to overcome nature, as well as from the discussion of the relationship between practice and knowledge, that what plays a decisive role in the technical revolution is people, not things, and that knowledge comes from practice. This encouraged the enthusiasm and studiousness of the broad masses of workers, setting off a great upsurge in the "Five-izations." When the Zhang Yufen team started working on the "Five-izations," the workers were not enthusiastic, saying, "We are girls, with low skills and little education, it will be embarrassing if we fail." "Let's wait until others have a model before we start!" The Party General Branch organized them to study works such as "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and "On Practice," which liberated their thinking. Zhang Yufen, the team leader, took the lead in encouraging everyone: "Chairman Mao said that if you want to know the taste of a pear, you have to taste it yourself. Each experiment will improve your understanding. Like the Foolish Old Man, as long as you have determination, you can overcome any difficulty!" This motivated the whole team to actively study, and they quickly achieved semi-automation and automation for the whole team. The number of workers was reduced from twenty-three at the beginning of the year to eight.

After studying Chairman Mao's works, many workers righteously criticized those who believed that "nothing can be improved if it's not in the books" as "cowards and lazybones." They said, "Chairman Mao taught us that theory is the summary of practice. If it's not in the books now, it can be written into the books after a successful experiment." When innovations encountered setbacks and difficulties, everyone encouraged each other, saying, "A fall into the pit, a gain in your wit, don't be discouraged!" "Overcoming one difficulty means there is one less. As long as we have determination, no difficulty can scare us!" Because the superstitious ideas about the "Five-izations" were eliminated, all the workers threw themselves into the movement. In less than a month, the degree of mechanization in the entire workshop increased from 65.9% at the beginning of the year to 80%.

After the city held a "Five-izations" on-site meeting in their factory, some people thought "it's almost done" and "we have automated everything that can be automated." The Party General Branch again used the theme of "opposing complacency and slackness, and establishing the idea of continuous leaps forward," organized workers to study the philosophical principles of contradictory movement and development in works such as "On Contradiction" and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." From top to bottom, problems were laid out, and Chairman Mao's works were used as weapons to discuss practical and theoretical issues, examine thinking, and find reasons. In this way, under the ideological guidance of "contradictions constantly appear and are constantly resolved, which is the objective law of the development of things," the workers criticized complacency and slackness. The enthusiasm of the masses of workers was even more boosted. They put forward the fighting slogan of "attacking for several days and nights, atomic explosion, red flowers blooming everywhere, every machine tool automated," and organized a 500-person "Five-izations" shock troop and 100 shock teams. They engaged in production during the day and innovation at night, combining professional work with mass participation, quickly setting off another upsurge in the "Five-izations" movement.

By the end of February, the number of automated and semi-automated machine tools in the workshop had rapidly increased from thirty-six in the first ten days of the month to one hundred and nine. Worker Zhang Beicai thought that the technical innovation in the workshop "had no more potential." However, after studying "On Contradiction" and "On Practice," he self-critiqued his complacency. After repeated experiments, he used a simple method of two tension springs and a rope to achieve automatic tool retraction for vertical milling. He said happily, "Practice, understanding, re-practice, re-understanding, deepening step by step, the production potential is unlimited. As long as you are willing to work hard, there are many tricks."

As the movement continued to develop in depth, some key problems that were difficult to overcome emerged. At this time, the Party General Branch focused on organizing workers to study issues such as the principal contradiction and the principal aspect of the contradiction in "On Contradiction." After leading all the workers to analyze what the principal contradiction in the current "Five-izations" movement was and identifying the key problems, it called on Party members to take the lead in storming the fortress and attacking the key points. Party member Qin Guangjin led a group of workers to address the key issue that the lack of electrical control equipment prevented more than 50 milling machines from achieving automation. He proposed a simple method of adding three gears and one shaft to the milling machine's traveling bridge, using mechanical principles to drive the handwheel to retract the tool. Initially, this idea was opposed by some people, but he said, "Chairman Mao told us that practice is the standard for testing truth. If we want to improve, we have to see it in the practice of improvement." He still insisted on experimenting. When the experiment suffered setbacks, he read "On Practice" and "On Protracted War" and said to other workers, "People's understanding is endless. After one failure, there is one experience. As long as the determination is great and the subjective initiative is brought into play, the improvement can be successful." The next eighteen experiments he carried out also failed. However, Qin Guangjin firmly believed in the truth put forward in Chairman Mao's works and continued to experiment unswervingly. Finally, he discovered and solved the principal contradiction that the screws were missing and could not control the wobbling of the gears, which made the experiment a success. Due to Qin Guangjin's leadership, not only were fifty milling machines in the entire workshop semi-automated, but all electrical equipment was saved, and a new way for milling machine automation was found. Sixty-eight of the workshop's 201 Party members made contributions in activities such as "attacking key points," and united and led 566 masses to overcome 410 major key problems.

Since January, this workshop has organized 155 study groups and studied theory through the workshop's spare-time Party school and Communist Youth League school. They adopted methods such as having a lesson before and after meetings, reading for a quarter of an hour before and after shifts, and running work section study stations on a large scale. Around the "Five-izations," they universally studied "On Contradiction," "On Practice," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," "Introducing a Cooperative," and Chairman Mao's works on combining the theory of continuous revolution with the theory of the stages of revolutionary development. This greatly promoted the "Five-izations" movement.

The development of the "Five-izations" movement has further promoted the upsurge in studying Chairman Mao's works. After all the machine tools in the Qiaoguniang (Clever Girls) group of the Third Work Section were automated and semi-automated, they could use six hours a day to study Chairman Mao's works. Their slogan was: "The group is the study, the vise is the classroom, a chorus of reading, everyone writing articles." This group became a "three-red" group in study, production, and "Five-izations." The Party General Branch immediately seized their experience and promoted it in the entire workshop, prompting more than 900 workers in the entire workshop to buy more than 5,000 copies of Chairman Mao's works and books about studying Chairman Mao's works in February alone. People kept books with them before and after work, competed for every second, and studied Chairman Mao's works seriously. (Attached image)

    学习毛主席著作提高了思想觉悟
    重庆建设机床厂三十五车间技术革命飞速发展
    据新华社重庆电　中共重庆建设机床厂三十五车间总支，广泛深入地组织职工学习毛主席著作，及时清除各种思想障碍，推动了“五化”（机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化、联动化）运动迅猛发展。到3月18日止，全车间机械化程度已由年初的65．9％，上升为98．7％，78％的机床已实现了自动化或半自动化，还实现了联动线一条。保证了旬旬超额、月月超额完成生产任务。
    这个车间在“五化”运动开始时，不少职工认为“技术水平低、搞不出什么名堂”“自动化深奥得很，啃不动”。这种思想阻碍了运动轰轰烈烈地开展。这时，党总支就确定以“破迷信，立壮志”为中心，组织全体职工学习了毛主席的“介绍一个合作社”、“愚公移山”、“实践论”等著作。并结合谈学习心得，就“在我们现有条件下，能不能实现‘五化’”等问题展开辩论。使职工从“愚公”和应举农业社社员那种战胜自然的雄心壮志与惊人的干劲中，以及实践与认识的关系的论述中，认识到在技术革命中起决定作用的是人，而不是物，以及认识来源于实践的道理，鼓舞了广大职工的干劲和钻劲，掀起了大闹“五化”的热潮。张玉芬小组开始搞“五化”时，工人不起劲，说：“我们女娃儿，技术低、文化少，搞不好反而逗人笑。”“等别人有了样板再搞吧！”党总支组织她们学习“愚公移山”、“实践论”等著作，解放了思想。组长张玉芬带头鼓动大家：“毛主席说你要知道梨子的味道就得亲自尝尝，试验一次认识就提高一步，像愚公那样，只要有决心，再大困难也能克服！”带动了全组积极钻研，很快就使全组实现了半自动化和自动化。工人由年初的二十三人减少为八人。
    许多工人学习了毛主席著作后，就理直气壮地批判那些认为“书本上没有就无法改进”的人是“懦夫懒汉”。他们说：“毛主席教导我们，理论是实践的总结，现在书本上没有，试验成功了就可以写到书本上去。”当革新遇到挫折和困难时，大家就彼此鼓励说：“吃一堑、长一智，不要泄气！”“战胜一个困难就少一个，只要有决心，任何困难都吓不倒人！”由于破除了对“五化”的迷信思想，全体职工都投入了运动，不到一个月的时间，全车间的机械化程度就由年初的65．9％提高到80％。
    当全市在他们厂里开了“五化”现场会以后，有的人就认为“差不多了”“能化的我们都化了”。党总支又以“反对自满松劲、树立不断跃进思想”为主题，组织职工学习了“矛盾论”“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”等著作中有关矛盾运动和发展的哲学原理，并从上至下地摊开问题，以毛主席的著作为武器，就实论虚，查思想，找原因。这样，职工们又在“矛盾不断出现，又不断解决，是事物发展的客观规律”的思想指导下，批判了自满松劲情绪。职工群众的干劲鼓得更足了。提出“突击几昼夜，原子大爆炸，红花开满段，台台自动化”的战斗口号，并且组织了五百人的“五化”突击大军，一百个突击小组，白天搞生产，晚上搞革新，专业搞与群众搞相结合，迅速掀起了又一次的“五化”运动高潮。
    2月底，车间的自动化和半自动机床由上旬的三十六台迅速提高为一百零九台。工人张倍才认为车间里的技术革新“再没有油水了”。但是，当他学习了“矛盾论”和“实践论”后，自我批判了自满情绪，经过反复试验，结果用两根拉簧和绳子的土办法，实现了立铣自动退刀。他高兴地说：“实践、认识、再实践、再认识，一步步深入，生产潜力是无止境的。只要舍得干，窍门多得很。”
    在运动继续深入向前发展中，出现了一些难于攻下的关键。这时，党总支便着重组织职工学习“矛盾论”中关于主要矛盾与主要的矛盾方面等问题。领导全体职工分析了当前“五化”运动中主要矛盾是什么，找出关键问题以后，又号召党员带头冲锋陷阵，猛攻关键。党员秦光金带领一批工人针对没有电器控制设备阻碍了五十多部铣车不能实现自动化的关键，提出采用在铣车走桥加三个牙轮和一根轴，利用机械原理带动手轮退刀的土办法。开初，这个意见遭到了一部分人反对，但他却说：“毛主席告诉我们实践才是检验真理的标准，要改进就得在改进的实践中来看看。”仍旧坚持试验。在试验受到挫折时，他又阅读“实践论”和“论持久战”等著作，并向其他工人说：“人的认识是无止境的，经过一次失败，就有一次经验，只要决心大，发挥了主观能动作用，就能使改进成功。”紧接着他进行的十八次试验又都失败了。但是，秦光金坚信毛主席著作中提出的真理，仍旧坚定不移地进行试验，最后终于发现和解决了螺丝上少了不能控制牙轮摇摆的主要矛盾，使试验获得了成功。由于秦光金的带动，不但使全车间五十部铣车实现了半自动化，而且节约了全部电动设备，为铣车自动化找出了一条新的途径。车间二百零一个党员，有六十八人在“攻关键”等活动中立了功，并且团结带动了五百六十六个群众，攻下重大关键问题四百一十项。
    这个车间从1月份以来，就组织了一百五十五个学习小组，通过车间业余党校、团校学理论。他们采取会前、会后上一课，班前班后读书一刻钟，以及大办工段学习站等方式，围绕“五化”，普遍学习了“矛盾论”、“实践论”、“愚公移山”、“介绍一个合作社”和毛主席关于不断革命论与革命发展阶段论相结合的著作。从而大大推动了“五化”运动。
    “五化”运动的开展，又进一步推动了学习毛主席著作的热潮。三工段巧姑娘小组全组机床实现自动化和半自动化以后，每天可用六个小时学习毛主席著作，她们的口号是：“组里当书房，钳台当课堂，一片读书声，人人写文章。”这个小组成为学习、生产、“五化”的“三红”小组。党总支立即抓住她们的经验，在全车间推广，促使全车间九百多职工仅在2月份就买了五千多本毛主席的著作和有关学习毛主席著作的书籍，人们上班前、下班后书不离人，分秒必争，个个认真学习毛主席著作。（附图片）
