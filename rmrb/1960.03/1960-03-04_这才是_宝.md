    This is the Real “Treasure”
    Wang Pu
    Awls, needles, and lasts have always been considered the "three treasures" in the hands of shoemakers. Without these "three treasures," shoes cannot be made. Now, 82% of the workers in the Xingtai Shoe Factory have abandoned these "three treasures" and switched to using machines. They not only make shoes, but they also make them more, faster, better, and more economically. Now, in the eyes of the workers at the Xingtai Shoe Factory, the real indispensable "treasure" is the machine, not the awl, needle, and last.

    All the tools that mankind relies on for production are constantly being updated. The so-called "treasure" is spoken of under certain historical conditions. For a long period, our revolutionary ranks had neither cannons nor airplanes; millet plus rifles were the "treasure." The revolutionaries relied on these "treasures" to strengthen their forces and annihilate the enemy. But when we had cannons, airplanes, and various modern weapons, no one would think that rifles were the best weapons. In industry, pneumatic picks were the treasures in the hands of coal miners in our country in the early days of liberation. At that time, coal miners used them to create many new records. But when combined coal mining machines appeared, pneumatic picks were no longer the best weapons in the hands of coal miners. With the continuous development of science and technology, new tools continue to emerge, and new treasures constantly replace old treasures. When new tools and new treasures have not yet appeared, or when there are no conditions for using them, throwing away the old tools and old treasures and waiting for the new tools and new treasures is divorced from reality. But when we are already able to use new tools and new weapons, we must actively use them; failing to actively use them and clinging to old tools and old weapons will hinder the development of production.

    Now, China's cloth shoe industry not only generally has the possibility of abandoning the "three treasures" of needles, awls, and lasts and switching to machine production, but it is also very necessary. It is estimated that the people of the whole country need about 2 billion pairs of shoes every year, of which cloth shoes account for about 75%, or about 1.5 billion pairs. To produce so many cloth shoes, if all are done by hand, it would require 8.1 million laborers to produce all year round. This is an extremely unreasonable phenomenon. After the rapid development of rural collectivization and urban street industries, the vast number of women in cities and villages have actively participated in social production labor, and the time spent on housework has been greatly reduced. Therefore, the number of people who make their own shoes has gradually decreased, and the number of people who buy shoes has gradually increased. Technological innovation to increase the production of commodity shoes, especially commodity cloth shoes, in order to meet the needs of 650 million people, is the new situation facing shoe industry workers today. If the workers of cloth shoe factories across the country, like the workers of the Xingtai Shoe Factory, see this situation clearly, launch a high tide of technological innovation, gradually abandon the three old treasures, and realize mechanized and semi-mechanized production, they can save 7.04 million laborers every year. This is a huge labor force that, if used to build factories, mines, and farmland water conservancy projects, would create tremendous wealth!

### 这才是“宝”

    这才是“宝”
    王朴
    针、锥、夹板，历来都被认为是鞋匠手中的“三件宝”，离开了这“三件宝”是做不出鞋来的。现在，邢台制鞋厂82％的工人都离开了这“三件宝”，改用了机器，他们不但做出鞋来，而且做得更多更快更好更省。现在，在邢台制鞋厂的工人看来，真正离不开的“宝”是机器，而不是针、锥和夹板了。
    人类赖以进行生产的一切工具，都在不断地更新着，所谓“宝”，都是在一定的历史条件下讲的。我们的革命队伍在很长的时期中，既没有大炮也没有飞机，小米加步枪就是“宝”。革命者依靠这些“宝”，壮大了自己力量，歼灭了敌人。可是等到有了大炮、飞机以及各种现代武器，谁也不会认为步枪是最好的武器。在工业里，风镐是解放初期我国采煤工人手里的宝贝，那时采煤工人用它创造了许多新纪录。但是到出现了联合采煤机，风镐就不再是采煤工人手中最好的武器了。随着科学技术的不断发展，新工具不断出现，新宝贝不断代替旧宝贝。当新的工具、新的宝贝还没有出现，或者还没有条件使用的时候，就扔掉旧的工具、旧的宝贝，坐等新工具、新宝贝，那是脱离实际的。但是当我们已经可能使用新工具、新武器的时候就必须积极使用；不积极使用，抱住旧工具、旧武器不放，就会阻碍生产的发展了。
    现在，我国布鞋业不但普遍具有丢掉针、锥、夹板“三件宝”，改用机器生产的可能，而且十分必要。据估计，现在全国人民每年大约需要二十多亿双鞋，其中布鞋约占75％，即十五亿双左右。生产这么多布鞋，如果都用手工操作，那就得八百一十万个劳动力常年生产。这是极其不合理的现象。农村公社化和城市街道工业迅速发展以后，城市和乡村的广大妇女纷纷参加了社会生产劳动，从事家务劳动的时间大大减少了，因而自己做鞋的逐渐减少，买鞋穿的逐渐增加。革新技术，增加商品鞋，特别是商品布鞋的生产，以便满足六亿五千万人民的需要，这便是制鞋业职工现在所面临的新形势。要是全国布鞋厂职工都像邢台制鞋厂的职工一样，瞧准这一形势，掀起技术革新高潮，逐步抛弃三件旧宝贝，实现机械化半机械化生产，每年就可以节约七百零四万个劳动力。这是一支庞大的劳动大军，用于建设厂矿企业和农田水利，会创造出多么巨大的财富来啊！
