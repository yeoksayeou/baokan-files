Brothers Countries' Cultural Life

    Rural Cultural Clubs
    In the past ten years, cultural facilities in Czechoslovakian villages have been improving. Now every village has a library, and almost half of the villages have reading rooms, which often organize various study classes, lectures, and seminars. The number of cinemas in rural areas has greatly increased, and the activities of film projection teams and rural theater groups have expanded. The number of specialized lectures and general education lectures has increased compared to the past.

    Center of Rural Cultural Life
    The work of strengthening rural cultural life is the responsibility of the local cultural and educational organs – the "Educational Symposium." In addition to the cultural and educational organs, another center has emerged in cultural life in recent years – the rural cultural club. They have achieved preliminary valuable achievements, and a bright future awaits them.

    From the rural cultural club organized by the unified agricultural cooperative in Doubi Village in the Moravian region, we can understand the role of the club in activating rural cultural life.

    In the past, in Doubi Village, a hotel and restaurant was the only "cultural" center in the village. In addition to small dance parties, local amateur entertainment groups occasionally held performances here. However, even such cultural activities were difficult to carry out, and the quality of their performances was very low.

    In the early 1950s, the situation improved after the establishment of cultural and educational organizations. However, in places where it was impossible to guarantee finding suitable housing – the most important condition for carrying out cultural activities – good wishes alone were not enough. Photography groups, music groups, and other amateur entertainment groups established at that time did not actually carry out activities; they were often just empty talk on paper.

    The situation did not fundamentally change until the end of 1957. After five years of collective operation, the unified agricultural cooperative had sufficient strength to grasp the cultural and educational work in the village and urge it on. Cooperative members organized a "cultural club." The most active supporters in preparing the club were the cooperative chairman Hliścień, the chairman of the local People's Committee, Víjvoda, the secretary of the People's Committee, Hlavaček, and the principal of the local eight-year secondary school, Musil, who are now the leaders of the club. At their initiative, the residents of Doubi Village renovated an old building themselves, in which three well-equipped club activity rooms are now located. When holding larger events, they either use the hall of the local hotel or the school classrooms.

    Colorful Activities
    Initially, the club's regulars were readers and children. Organizing Young Pioneers' extracurricular entertainment groups, preparing evening performances, and organizing recreational evenings were the tasks carried out by the club at the beginning. But soon after, adults, cooperative members, tractor drivers from machine tractor stations, and workers from state farms also often came to the club for entertainment or to learn some knowledge. The residents of Doubi Village often went to the club to watch movies – popular science films and technical films – or to listen to lectures. The work of the club's drama enthusiasts group has improved, the work of other groups has also become active, and new art groups have been established. The club has invited local experts to hold art lectures to help people improve their artistic cultivation and art appreciation ability. The club has also held lectures on chapters of outstanding works and a statewide painting exhibition of visual artists from the Ihrava Highlands region.

    Serving Agricultural Production
    The club committee noted that the most important issue for farmers was how to further improve the management of fields and stables. The club also helped the cooperative gradually shift from crop cultivation to seed planting and assisted the cooperative in reducing the cost of breeding economic livestock.

    Since the cooperative labor school was placed under the leadership of the cooperative and the club, it is firmly believed that its activities will be further strengthened and will fully adapt to the needs of the cooperative.

    The club in Doubi Village has truly changed the face of the village. The new culture has triumphed just as collective management has triumphed over the old thinking of individual farmers. The work of the rural club has truly achieved success!

    农村文化俱乐部
    最近十年来，捷克斯洛伐克农村中的文化设备日益改善。现在每个农村都有图书馆，几乎有一半农村设有读书室，它们经常组织各种学习班、讲座和座谈会等。农村中的电影院大大增加，电影放映队和农村剧团的活动扩大了，专门讲座和普通教育讲座的次数比以前增多了……。
    农村文化生活的中心
    加强农村文化生活的工作由地方文教机关——“教育座谈会”负责。除文教机关外，最近几年来在文化生活中出现了另一个中心——农村文化俱乐部。它们已取得初步的宝贵成就，美好的未来期待着它们。
    从摩拉维亚地区多乌彼村由统一农业合作社组织的农村文化俱乐部，可以了解到俱乐部对活跃农村文化生活的作用。
    过去，在多乌彼村，有一家旅店兼饭馆是该村的唯一的“文化”中心。除小型舞会外，这里偶尔由地方业余文娱团体举办演出，但是，即使展开这样一些文化活动也十分困难，他们演出的节目质量很低。
    在五十年代初，自从成立文教组织后，情况有了好转。但是在无法保证找到合适的房子——这是开展文化活动的最主要的条件——的那些地方，只具备良好的愿望还是不够的。摄影组、音乐组和当时成立的其它业余文娱小组实际上没有进行活动，它们往往只是纸上空谈。
    直到1957年年底，情况才有了根本的转变。统一农业合作社在经过五年的集体经营后，已具备足够的力量去抓村里的文教工作，并对它进行督促。合作社社员组织起了一个“文化俱乐部”。筹备俱乐部的最积极的支持者是合作社主席赫利斯剂安、地方人民委员会主席维依伏达、人民委员会秘书赫拉瓦切克和地方八年制中等学校的校长穆西尔，他们现在是俱乐部的领导人。在他们的倡议下，多乌彼村的居民自己动手改建了一座旧建筑，在这座建筑内现在设立了设备完善的三个俱乐部的活动室。在举办较大型的活动时，或则利用当地旅馆的大厅，或则利用学校教室。
    丰富多彩的活动
    最初，俱乐部的常客是读者和儿童。组织少先队课余文娱小组、筹备晚会演出、组织休息晚会，这就是俱乐部开始时所进行的工作。但在不久以后，成年人、合作社社员、机器拖拉机站的拖拉机手和国营农场的工人也常来俱乐部娱乐或是学习一些知识。多乌彼村的居民经常到俱乐部来看电影——科学通俗片和技术片——或是听讲座。俱乐部的戏剧爱好者小组的工作有了改进，其它组的工作也活跃起来了，并新成立了美术小组等。俱乐部曾请当地专家举办艺术讲座，帮助人们提高艺术修养、艺术欣赏能力。俱乐部还举办过优秀作品章节讲座和依赫拉瓦高地地区造型艺术工作者全州画展。
    为农业生产服务
    俱乐部委员会注意到对农民来说最重要的问题是如何进一步改进田间和马厩的管理工作。俱乐部还帮助合作社逐步从植物栽培业转到种籽种植业方面去，并协助合作社降低繁殖经济牲畜的费用。
    自从合作社劳动学校划归合作社和俱乐部领导之后，人们深信，它的活动一定会进一步加强，并会完全适应合作社的需要。
    多乌彼村的俱乐部真正改变了这个村的生活面貌。新文化正如集体经营战胜了个体农民的旧思想一样取得了胜利。农村俱乐部的工作真正取得了成就！
