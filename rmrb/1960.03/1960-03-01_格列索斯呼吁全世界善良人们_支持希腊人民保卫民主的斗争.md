Xinhua News Agency, Athens, 29th: According to a TASS report from Athens, the Greek newspaper "Avgi" published an appeal by Manolis Glezos to all kind people in the world on the 28th.

In his appeal, Glezos pointed out that on March 12th, the Supreme Court will hear the application for a retrial of the Athens Military Tribunal's trial and verdict. He wrote: "Needless to say, the verdict is unjust... I sincerely believe that no one, not even those whose minds are clouded by fanaticism, would believe that I and my comrades are 'spies' or that we would engage in 'espionage.'"

The appeal stated that nearly 2,500 anti-fascist and anti-Hitler patriots from 1941 to 1944, as well as hundreds of resistance fighters and fighters for democracy, have been imprisoned in prisons and concentration camps for more than a decade. Tens of thousands of citizens are constantly persecuted and have lost their jobs.

The appeal pointed out that the Greek Constitution guarantees freedom of activity, assembly, and association for all political parties. However, the government has declared the Greek Communist Party illegal and is persecuting other political parties, especially the United Democratic Left Party, the first opposition party in parliament.

Glezos cited various intolerable examples of tyranny and pointed out the serious situation in the country. He wrote that the Greek people "know that the main cause of this situation is the Cold War policy that has been imposed on our country."

Glezos emphasized that recently, anti-democratic forces in Greece have been rampant. He concluded by calling on all kind people to support not only the Greek people's struggle to overturn the verdicts against him and other patriots and to abolish Law 375, but also the struggle to abolish all laws from the civil war period and to defend democracy, which is being undermined and faces the danger of complete suppression.

    格列索斯呼吁全世界善良人们
    支持希腊人民保卫民主的斗争
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社雅典讯：希腊“黎明日报”28日发表了曼诺里斯·格列索斯给全世界善良的人们的呼吁书。
    格列索斯在呼吁书中指出，3月12日，最高法院将审理关于重审雅典军事法庭的审讯和判决的申请书。他写道：“不用说，判决是不公正的……我真诚地相信，任何人，甚至那些由于狂热而头脑不清的人，也不会相信我和我的同志是‘间谍’或者我们会进行‘间谍活动’。”
    呼吁书写道，有将近二千五百名在1941—1944年期间反法西斯和反希特勒的爱国者以及几百名抵抗运动战士和争取民主的战士，十几年来一直被监禁在监狱和集中营里。还有成千上万的公民经常受到迫害，失去了工作。
    呼吁书指出，希腊宪法保障各政党活动、集会和结社自由。但是政府竟宣布希腊共产党非法，而且迫害其他政党，特别是议会中的第一个反对党——统一民主左翼党。
    格列索斯援引了各种令人不能容忍的专横的例子，并且指出了国内的严重状况。他写道，希腊人民“知道，造成这种状况的，主要是被强加在我国身上的冷战政策”。
    格列索斯强调指出，最近期间，希腊反民主的势力正在猖獗活动。他最后呼吁一切善良的人们不仅支持希腊人民为取消对他和其他一些爱国者的判决和废除第三百七十五号法律而进行的斗争，而且支持为废除国内战争时期的一切法律、为保卫正遭到破坏和面临完全被扼杀的危险的民主而进行的斗争。
