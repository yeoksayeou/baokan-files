Editorial: Quickly Implement the "Three Guarantees" Down to the Team

    Spring plowing and sowing work is about to begin in full swing. The most important task at present is to quickly implement the production plan for continued agricultural leap forward this year down to the contracted units, and to implement the agricultural output targets, costs, and labor input down to the team. It can be said that implementing the "three guarantees" of contracted work, contracted output, and contracted costs down to the team has become the main link in further mobilizing the masses to do a good job in preparing for cultivation and combining the soaring enthusiasm of the masses with specific measures to meet the spring plowing and sowing.
    Why is it said that implementing the "three guarantees" down to the team is the main link in the current spring sowing preparation work? We know that the production team is the most basic production unit of the people's commune. Although the people's commune has many methods for guiding the production activities of the production team, one of the most important is to implement the "three guarantees" system. After the "three guarantees" targets are implemented in each production team, the production team can clearly understand its production tasks and production responsibilities, give full play to its enthusiasm and creativity, and strive to complete and overfulfill the plan. Implementing the "three guarantees" down to the team is also an important method for checking spring plowing and sowing preparations. Are the increased production targets appropriate? Are the increased production measures reliable? This can be seen through the implementation of the "three guarantees" down to the team. If the increased production target is too high, the "three guarantees" cannot be implemented; if the increased production target is conservative, the problem can be discovered from the "three guarantees"; if the increased production measures are not practical, the "three guarantees" cannot be implemented. Therefore, in the spring plowing and sowing preparation stage, the "three guarantees" should be implemented down to the team as soon as possible; and the earlier the implementation, the better. After the Xuzhou Special District of Jiangsu Province seized the work of implementing the "three guarantees" down to the team, the cadres and members were more enthusiastic, and the spring sowing preparation work was done more excellently. Due to the early implementation of the "three guarantees" down to the team in Xingzi County, Jiangxi Province, various increased production measures in spring sowing preparation have been effectively implemented; at the same time, various management systems have been improved, so that various productions can be carried out in a planned and orderly manner. All these facts fully demonstrate how much impetus the implementation of the "three guarantees" will have on the current spring sowing preparation work.
    Judging from the current situation in some areas, there are still some areas that have not implemented the "three guarantees" down to the team. This is mainly because some people believe that production has leaped forward, and the "three guarantees" can be dispensed with; or they believe that with the adoption of large-scale collaboration and specialized management forms of labor organization, it is not necessary to engage in "three guarantees." In the situation of a great leap forward in agriculture, should the "three guarantees" be implemented? The answer is yes. Whether or not to implement the "three guarantees" is essentially whether or not to hand the plan over to the masses for discussion, and whether or not to mobilize the masses to strive to overfulfill the plan. The facts of the agricultural great leap forward in 1958 and 1959 prove that only by extensively and deeply mobilizing the masses and arousing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses can we achieve continuous leap forward victories. The correct conclusion should be: the more production leaps forward, the more necessary it is to do a good job in the "three guarantees." There is no contradiction between adopting large-scale collaboration and specialized management labor organization forms and implementing the "three guarantees." On the contrary, large-scale collaboration and specialized management can only be done well on the basis of the "three guarantees" being implemented. Large-scale collaboration and specialized management, if there are no increased production targets and no increased production measures, will have no clear goals to strive for, no clear responsibilities, and production order will be chaotic. This will only bring losses to production. We believe that the "three guarantees" system was needed in the past, is still needed today, and will not be dispensable for a considerable period of time in the future. The question now is not whether or not to engage in the "three guarantees," but how to do a good job in the "three guarantees."
    How to do a good job in the "three guarantees" work? First, the "three guarantees" should be early. Since last winter, due to the in-depth development of the socialist education movement in rural areas, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and the masses has been unprecedentedly high, and they have generally put forward the slogan of "spring work done in winter," and have done many spring production tasks that can be carried out in advance. Spring plowing of land has turned into winter plowing, and spring repair of farm implements has turned into winter repair. The result of "spring work done in winter" will inevitably lead to a new situation of "summer work done in spring." In this way, the "three guarantees" must also be greatly advanced. The old habit of grasping the "three guarantees" only when spring plowing begins is obviously no longer able to meet the needs of the development of the situation. In order to make the "three guarantees" better play a role in promoting production, to achieve early contracting of production and early initiative, in the future, we should achieve the goal of contracting the "three guarantees" for the second year's summer-ripening crops after the summer harvest, and immediately after the autumn harvest, we should do a good job in the "three guarantees" for the second year's autumn-ripening crops. According to these requirements, this year's autumn-ripening "three guarantees" is not considered early. Second, the "three guarantees" should be comprehensive. This year's requirements for the "three guarantees" are very different from the past. The content of the "three guarantees" is required to be more comprehensive. It is necessary to take grain as the key link, do a good job in the "three guarantees" for grain crops, and comprehensively do a good job in the "three guarantees" for cotton, oil, hemp, tobacco, tea, sugar, vegetables, silk, medicine, fruits, and miscellaneous crops; it is necessary to do a good job in the "three guarantees" for various crops, and to comprehensively carry out the "three guarantees" for forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery. Only in this way can we achieve a comprehensive leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery. If any item does not have the "three guarantees," that item may be squeezed out; if any item is not guaranteed well, there is a danger that the production task will not be completed. Third, the "three guarantees" should be new. Due to the great leap forward in the past two years, production conditions in all aspects have undergone great changes. For example, water conservancy construction has been further expanded, the soil has been further improved, basic farmland construction has further increased, the degree of agricultural mechanization has also greatly increased, and technical innovation and technical revolution centered on the "Eight-Character Charter for Agriculture" have also made new developments. In this way, this year's "three guarantees" must see the above-mentioned changes in natural conditions and production conditions, and put forward new increased production requirements and measures. We cannot stick to old ways and use last year's old framework. Only by constantly enriching the content of the "three guarantees" with the changes in production conditions and adapting the "three guarantees" to the new situation can we promote the continued leap forward in production.
    What issues should be paid attention to in the implementation of the "three guarantees"? According to the experience of Jiangsu and other places, the production guarantee targets should be both active and advanced, and should also leave room for maneuver. They should not be too low or too high. If they are too low, they will not encourage the masses to work hard and skillfully, to find key points, and to tap potential. If they are too high, they will affect the enthusiasm of the members to overproduce. Therefore, the production guarantee targets should generally be slightly lower than this year's planned targets, but must be appropriately increased on the basis of last year's actual yield. In areas that suffered heavy disasters and reduced production last year, the addition of production guarantee targets should be based on normal years. In order to make the production guarantee targets take root in the minds of the masses, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses to discuss, talk about the situation, and carry out political and ideological work extensively and deeply, so that the process of "three guarantees" becomes a process of spring plowing ideological mobilization, and the targets truly become the "targets in the hearts of the masses, and the targets in the hands of the masses." Contracted work must be fully contracted at one time according to the leap forward targets and measures. How much work is needed for production, and how much work is contracted; if the contracted work is insufficient, the planned measures cannot be fulfilled. The actual contracted work should be unified with the needs of the planned measures, and a separate set cannot be made. Some people see that there are many production projects this year, and the technical specifications are high, and they are worried that the amount of work will increase and the labor force will be insufficient, so they attempt to reduce the amount of work by reducing the requirements of the planned measures. This is obviously not right. A significant increase in the amount of work may promote people to engage in large-scale tool reform and technical innovation, improve work efficiency, and constantly break through old labor quotas. Average advanced labor quotas should be formulated according to tool reform, changes in production conditions, and the increase in the enthusiasm of the masses. The same is true for contracting costs. First, it is necessary to ensure the needs of continued leap forward in production. What should be used in production must be fully contracted, and arbitrary discounts cannot be made without regard to reality. At the same time, we must adhere to the principle of running the commune diligently and thriftily, emphasize local materials, self-reliance, reduce costs, and increase production. If something can be done without spending money, do not spend a penny; if something can be done with less money, try to spend less. What the production team really cannot do, the commune and the brigade will support; what the production team can do on its own, it should try to do on its own. In today's situation of great development of multiple economies, when carrying out the "three guarantees," we must pay attention to ensuring that agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery are fully guaranteed. Forestry and cash crops must guarantee both output and output value. Fishery guarantees the growth rate according to the number of releases. The silkworm industry must guarantee the number of mulberry trees and the output per sheet.
    Finally, it must also be pointed out that we should not have the idea of one-time success for the "three guarantees," thinking that once it is guaranteed, it will be all right. This is an unrealistic idea. After this "three guarantees" is done well, the content of the "three guarantees" should be revised as necessary with the continued leap forward in production. Only in this way can the "three guarantees" continue to develop and constantly adapt to the needs of production development. At present, party committees at all levels should strengthen their leadership over the "three guarantees" work, and should conduct a comprehensive inspection of the implementation of the "three guarantees" in conjunction with the spring plowing preparation campaign. If the "three guarantees" have not been implemented, they should be implemented quickly; if the content of the "three guarantees" is not realistic enough, it should be revised carefully and quickly. Only when the "three guarantees" are implemented, can the plan be implemented, the enthusiasm be implemented, and there be a practical guarantee for completing the preparation for cultivation.

### 快把“三包”落实到队

    快把“三包”落实到队
    春耕春种工作即将全面展开，当前一个最重要的任务就是把今年农业继续跃进的生产计划尽快地落实到包产单位，把农业的产量指标、成本和用工量落实到队。可以这样说，把包工、包产、包成本的“三包”落实到队，已经成为当前进一步发动群众搞好备耕、把群众的冲天干劲和具体措施结合起来迎接春耕春种的主要环节。
    为什么说“三包”落实到队是当前春播准备工作的主要环节呢？我们知道，生产小队是人民公社的最基层的生产单位，人民公社指导生产小队的生产活动的方法虽然很多，但是其中很重要的一条是实行
  “三包”制度。“三包”指标落实到各个生产小队以后，生产小队就能够明确了解自己的生产任务和生产责任，充分发挥自己的积极性和创造性，为完成和超额完成计划而努力。“三包”落实到队也是目前检查春耕春种准备的一个重要方法，增产指标是不是恰当？增产措施是不是可靠？通过“三包”落实到队就可以看得出来。增产指标过高了，“三包”就无法落实；增产指标保守了，从“三包”中就可以发现问题，增产措施不切合实际，“三包”也落实不下来。因此，在春耕春种准备阶段，就应该把“三包”尽快落实到队；而且落实得越早越好。江苏省徐州专区抓紧“三包”落实到队的工作以后，干部和社员干劲更大，春播准备工作做得更加出色。江西省星子县由于“三包”及早落实到队，春播准备中的各项增产措施都得到了有力地贯彻；同时还健全了各项管理制度，使得各项生产能够有计划、有秩序地进行。所有这些事实，都充分说明了“三包”落实对于当前的春播准备工作会发生多大的推动作用。
    从目前某些地区情况来看，还有一些地区没有把“三包”落实到队。这主要是有人认为生产大跃进了，“三包”可以不搞了；或者认为采用了大协作与专业专管的劳动组织形式，可以不必搞“三包”了。在农业大跃进的形势下，到底要不要实行“三包”呢？答复是肯定的。所谓要不要实行“三包”，实质就是要不要把计划交给群众讨论，要不要发动群众争取超额完成计划。1958年和1959年农业大跃进的事实证明，只有广泛深入地发动群众、鼓起群众的革命干劲，才可以取得连续跃进的胜利。正确的结论应该是：越是生产大跃进了，就越是要搞好“三包”。采用大协作、专业专管劳动组织形式和实行“三包”并没有矛盾，相反，只有在“三包”落实的基础上，才能搞好大协作与专业专管。大协作与专业专管，如果没有增产指标，没有增产措施，就会没有明确的奋斗目标，就会没有明确的责任，生产秩序就会产生混乱。这只会给生产带来损失。我们认为，“三包”制度过去需要，今天仍然需要，不仅今天仍然需要，而且在今后相当长时期内也仍然少不了它。现在的问题不是要不要搞“三包”，而是怎样搞好“三包”。
    怎样搞好“三包”工作呢？第一，“三包”要早。去冬以来，由于各地农村深入开展了社会主义教育运动，广大干部群众干劲空前高涨，普遍提出“春活冬干”的口号，把许多可以提前进行的春季生产任务都提前做了。土地春耕变冬耕，农具春修变冬修。“春活冬干”的结果，必将会出现“夏活春干”的新情况。这样，“三包”也就必须大大提前，过去到春耕开始才抓“三包”的老习惯，显然已经不能适应形势发展的需要了。为了使“三包”更好地发挥推动生产的作用，做到早包产，早主动，今后应该做到在夏收以后就把第二年夏熟“三包”包下去，在秋收以后就紧接着把第二年秋熟“三包”搞好。按照这样的要求，今年的秋熟“三包”，已经抓得不算早了。第二，“三包”要全。今年对“三包”的要求与过去有个很大不同的地方，就是要求“三包”的内容更加全面了。既要以粮为纲，搞好粮食作物的“三包”，又要全面搞好棉、油、麻、烟、茶、糖、菜、丝、药、果、杂的“三包”；既要搞好各种农作物的“三包”，又要对林、牧、副、渔全面进行“三包”。只有这样，才能实现农、林、牧、副、渔全面跃进。哪一项没有“三包”，那一项就有可能被挤掉；哪一项没有包好，那一项生产任务就有完不成的危险。第三，“三包”要新。由于两年来的大跃进，各方面的生产条件都起了很大变化，比如水利建设进一步扩大，土壤有了进一步改良，农田基本建设进一步增加，农业机械化程度也大大增长，以农业“八字宪法”为中心的技术革新和技术革命也有了新的发展。这样，今年搞“三包”，就一定要看到上面这些自然条件与生产条件的变化，提出新的增产要求和措施，不能因循守旧，沿用去年的老框子去套。只有随着生产条件的变化，不断地充实“三包”的内容，使“三包”适应新的情况，才能推动生产继续跃进。
    在“三包”落实中应该注意哪些问题呢？根据江苏等地的经验，包产指标既要积极先进，又要留有余地，不能偏低或偏高。偏低了，就不能鼓励群众实干巧干，找关键，挖潜力。偏高了，又会影响社员超产的积极性。因此，包产指标一般应该稍低于今年计划指标，但又必须在去年的实收产量的基础上适当增加。在去年遭受重灾减产的地区，包产指标加成应当以正常年景为出发点。为了使包产指标在群众思想上扎根，必须充分发动群众讨论，大讲形势，广泛、深入地进行政治思想工作，使“三包”的过程变为春耕思想动员的过程，使指标真正成为群众“心里的指标，手里的指标”。包工，必须根据跃进的指标和措施一次包足，生产上需要多少工就包多少工；如果包工不足，计划措施就不能兑现。实际包工应该跟计划措施的需要统一起来，不能另搞一套。有人看到今年生产项目多、技术规格要求高，担心用工量加大、劳力不足，就企图用降低计划措施要求的消极办法来减少用工量，这显然是不对的。工量大大增加，就有可能会推动人们去大搞工具改革和技术革新，提高工效，不断突破老的劳动定额。要根据工具改革、生产条件变化以及群众积极性提高等情况，制订平均先进的劳动定额。包成本也是这样，首先要保证生产继续跃进的需要，生产上该用的，一定要包足，不能不切实际地乱打折扣。但同时，又必须坚持勤俭办社的原则，强调就地取材、自力更生，降低成本、提高产量。能够不花钱的，一文不花；能够少花钱的，尽量少花。生产队真正不能办的，由公社、大队支持来办；生产队能够自己办的，则应该尽量自己办。在今天多种经济大发展的情况下，进行“三包”，必须注意将农、林、牧、副、渔项项包足包全，林业和经济作物既要包产量，又要包产值，渔业按放养数包成长率，养蚕业要以桑包张，以张包产。
    最后，还必须指出，对于“三包”不要有一劳永逸的想法，以为一次包好，就完事大吉了。这是不切实际的想法。这次搞好“三包”以后，还要随着生产的继续跃进，对“三包”的内容加以必要的修订。只有这样，“三包”才能不断发展，不断适应生产发展的需要。目前，各地党委要加强对“三包”工作的领导，要结合春季备耕运动大检查，对“三包”落实的情况进行一次全面大检查。“三包”没有落实的，要赶快落实；“三包”内容不够切实的，要赶快认真修订。只有“三包”落实，计划才能落实，干劲才能落实，完成备耕工作才有切实的保证。
