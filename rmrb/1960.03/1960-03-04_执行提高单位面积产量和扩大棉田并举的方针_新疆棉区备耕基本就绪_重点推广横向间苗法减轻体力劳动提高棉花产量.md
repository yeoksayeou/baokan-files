Implementing the Policy of Simultaneously Increasing Yield Per Unit Area and Expanding Cotton Fields
Xinjiang Cotton Region Basically Ready for Spring Planting
Focus on Promoting Horizontal Thinning Method to Reduce Physical Labor and Increase Cotton Production

(Reported by this newspaper) In the cotton-producing regions north and south of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang, under the policy of simultaneously increasing yield per unit area and expanding cotton fields, efforts have been stepped up to prepare for cotton planting, focusing on soil, fertilizer, water, and seeds.

In recent years, the total output and yield per unit area of cotton in various cotton-producing areas of Xinjiang have continuously increased. This year, in order to further develop cotton production, all cotton fields have been winter-irrigated, and more than 85% of the cotton fields have been deeply ploughed. At the same time, in conjunction with water conservancy efforts, all levels of canals within the cotton fields have been repaired, so that most of the cotton fields are connected, and some people's communes' cotton fields have initially reached the standard of garden-like management.

After the Spring Festival, people's communes and military reclamation farms in various cotton-growing areas launched a high tide of welcoming cotton sowing work. They actively transported fertilizer to the fields, carefully selected and dried cotton seeds, and repaired and added agricultural tools and sowing machines to ensure timely cotton sowing. At present, Kashgar Prefecture, the largest cotton-growing area in Xinjiang, has completed the leveling of all cotton fields, and has also carried out winter ploughing and winter irrigation. Those with insufficient soil moisture have carried out early spring irrigation. All the required high-quality cotton seeds in the region have been ginned, and most of them have been transported to grassroots production units. By mid-February, Makit, Bachu, Shache, Yuepuhu and other counties had selected 40% of high-quality seeds. Thousands of fertilizer accumulation shock teams have accumulated an average of 5,000 catties of high-quality fertilizer per mu of cotton field, and are now transporting it to the fields. Moyu County in Hotan Prefecture, a key cotton-growing county, learned from the lessons of untimely and imprecise cotton field preparation work last year, and stepped up cotton planting preparation work two months in advance this year. At present, the preparation work has been basically completed, and sowing can be started as soon as the soil temperature rises to twelve or thirteen degrees. The Manas and Usu reclamation areas of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps plan to expand the cotton fields to be planted this year by 50% to 100% compared with last year. These farms, in view of the local cold climate and short frost-free period, have focused on promoting early maturity of cotton in their preparation work. First, they combine winter ploughing and winter irrigation to apply high-quality fertilizer to cotton fields early to increase soil temperature, and at the same time delint most of the cotton seeds. At present, thousands of sledges and a large number of tractors, in addition to transporting fertilizer to the cotton fields, also transport a large amount of sand and soil to viscous soil and soil with high salt-alkali content to prevent soil hardening and salt-alkali rise. Some people are continuing to delint cotton seeds to ensure that the cotton sowing plan is completed within five to seven days.

Party committees and relevant departments at all levels in Xinjiang attach special importance to cotton planting work. As early as last winter, they led farmers in various places to launch a massive campaign to build water conservancy projects, reclaim wasteland and improve soil, so that cotton-producing areas increased the planting area of cotton fields while ensuring the expansion of grain crop area, and improved the irrigation conditions of cotton fields. Immediately afterwards, they led farmers to carry out a large-scale cotton field high-yield campaign, re-planning the previously scattered cotton fields to form new large-scale cotton areas, and designated about 20% of the land as high-yield demonstration plots, which not only facilitates centralized management, but also uses the experience of large-scale high-yield fields to guide general field production on the spot.

In order to ensure that cotton is well planted and managed, party committees and agricultural departments at all levels are focusing on the exchange and teaching of cotton planting technology. At the beginning of January, the Autonomous Region convened a Xinjiang Agricultural Technology Conference to specifically discuss and exchange cotton high-yield experiences in various places, and formulated specific measures to strive for a bumper cotton harvest this year. Each cotton-growing area has also formulated detailed local cotton planting measures based on local natural conditions and key issues that hinder cotton from obtaining higher yields. The Manas reclamation area has recently printed the cotton planting measures jointly researched and formulated by party committee secretaries at all levels, farm directors, technicians, and cotton planting experts into detailed materials and distributed them to each production team for reference. The Turpan County has established a cotton planting lecture group composed of technicians and cotton planting experts to go deep into each production team and teach cotton planting technology in rotation.

Seed departments and commercial institutions in various places have also greatly strengthened the popularization of improved varieties and material supply to cotton areas, and a large number of pesticides and fertilizers have been given priority to cotton-growing areas.

(Reported by this newspaper) More than 60 cotton-growing military reclamation farms in the Manas River Basin and Tarim, key cotton-growing areas in Xinjiang, are universally converting cotton planters and promoting the horizontal thinning method to ensure that cotton fields do not leak rows, do not have broken rows, and have uniform seedling emergence. The horizontal thinning method is a major reform in cotton planting technology in Xinjiang farms this year. The universal promotion of this thinning method can greatly reduce heavy physical labor, increase cotton production, and reduce production costs.

This year, the cotton planting area of ​​each cotton-growing farm will be about doubled compared with last year, and the yield per unit area is also required to greatly exceed last year. If the original farming methods are used, it will inevitably increase the labor force exponentially and increase costs. In order to strive for a large-scale high yield, at the beginning of January this year, these dozens of farms comprehensively summarized their cotton planting experience in recent years, and actively started from improving labor productivity and improving farming methods to solve the contradiction of insufficient labor, and decided to comprehensively promote the major technical measure of horizontal thinning. However, the implementation of this reform must first ensure the quality of cotton sowing, so that cotton fields do not leak rows, do not have broken rows, and have uniform seedling emergence, in order to ensure that enough plants are retained per mu after horizontal thinning. Therefore, pre-sowing training is very important. At present, each cotton-growing farm is stepping up preparations for spring planting on the one hand, and actively training cotton planting personnel on the other, and simultaneously carrying out technical training for cotton sowing and horizontal thinning. More than 4,000 tractor drivers and farm implement operators are rapidly mastering the farming methods of cotton sowing and horizontal thinning by checking and repairing machines while practicing, and learning to install and adjust these machines. Each farm will also improve the level of operation through a strict examination system for new and old drivers through on-site operation tests, and put them into cotton planting production as soon as possible.

Horizontal thinning is a relatively advanced cotton planting farming method. This method is mainly based on strip planting, using machines or animal power to pull a cultivator to horizontally hoe seedlings, and then slightly manually transplant, so that the cotton field forms a square row spacing of 60 centimeters. In recent years, the results of trials in various farms have not only replaced the heavy manual thinning labor with machines or animal power, but also, because the row spacing is square, it can be cultivated, weeded, and reduce manual soil loosening and manual weeding operations, which greatly improves labor production efficiency. According to surveys by two cotton-growing farms in the Manas River Basin: the implementation of horizontal thinning can reduce manual labor by 43% per mu, reduce costs by about 40%, and increase the management quota from 15 mu per person to 25 mu and 27 mu. More importantly, farming does not miss the agricultural season. With horizontal thinning, each farm can complete the thinning work in only three or four days; while with manual thinning, due to low efficiency, tight spring ploughing labor, or scattered cotton fields, many farms often have to extend it for more than ten days or even a month, which cannot be cultivated in time, seriously affecting the normal growth of cotton. The number of cultivation, weeding, and topdressing times for cotton fields that implement horizontal thinning is three times more than that of cotton fields that implement manual thinning; for cotton fields that implement manual thinning, only longitudinal cultivation can be carried out along the seedling rows, and only 58% of the area per mu is cultivated, while for cotton fields that implement horizontal thinning, because cultivation can be carried out in a criss-cross manner, the area cultivated can be increased to more than 83%, effectively promoting the robust growth of cotton branches and root systems, and the shedding rate can generally be reduced by 7.2% per mu, and the yield is also more than ten catties of seed cotton per mu higher than that of ordinary manually thinned cotton fields, and it can mature three or four days earlier.

    执行提高单位面积产量和扩大棉田并举的方针
    新疆棉区备耕基本就绪
    重点推广横向间苗法减轻体力劳动提高棉花产量
    本报讯　新疆天山南北各产棉区，在提高单产和扩大棉田同时并举的方针下，提早狠抓土、肥、水、种等植棉准备工作。
    几年来，新疆各产棉区棉花总产和单产不断提高。今年为了进一步发展棉花生产，全部棉田进行了冬灌，85％以上的棉田经过深翻，同时结合水利运动，整修了棉田内的各级渠道，使大部分棉田连片，部分人民公社的棉田还初步达到了园田化的标准。
    春节以后，各植棉区的人民公社和军垦农场，就掀起了迎接棉花播种工作的高潮，他们积极地往地里赶运肥料，精选和翻晒棉种，检修、添置农具和播种机等，保证棉花适时下种。目前全疆最大的植棉专区喀什专区，全部棉田已经平整完毕，还进行了冬翻冬灌，墒情不足的已提早春灌。全区所需的优良棉种已经轧好，绝大部分运到了基层生产单位，麦盖提、巴楚、莎车、岳普湖等县，到2月中旬已精选良种40％。数以千计的积肥突击队，平均已为每亩棉田积好优质肥五千斤，现在正往田间赶运。和阗专区重点植棉县墨玉县，吸取了去年棉田备耕工作不及时、不精细的教训，今年提前两月狠抓植棉准备工作，目前备耕工作已基本就绪，只俟地温上升到十二、三度时，就可开犁下种。新疆生产建设兵团玛纳斯和乌苏垦区各农场，今年计划种植的棉田比去年扩大了50％到一倍。这些农场都针对当地气候较冷、无霜期短的特点，在备耕中大抓促使棉花早熟的工作，首先是结合冬翻冬灌，给棉田提早施优质肥料增加地温，同时将绝大部分棉籽脱了绒。目前成千上万爬犁和大批拖拉机除往棉田里赶运肥料外，还把大量的沙、土运往粘壤和含盐碱量较多的地里，以防止土壤板结、盐碱上升，部分人员正继续为棉籽脱绒，保证在五至七天内完成播棉计划。
    新疆各级党委和有关部门对各地植棉工作特别重视，早在去年冬季就领导各地农民展开了声势浩大的兴修水利、开荒造田、改良土壤的运动，使各产棉地区在保证扩大粮食作物面积的同时，增加了棉田播种面积，并改善了棉田的灌溉条件。紧接着又领导农民大搞大面积棉田丰产方运动，将过去零散的棉田，重新作了规划，形成新的大面积棉区，并将其中20％左右的土地确定为丰产方，这样不仅便于集中管理，还以大面积丰产田的经验就地指导一般田生产。
    为了确保棉花种好、管好，各级党委和农业部门，大抓植棉技术的交流和传授工作。元月初，自治区就召开了全疆农业技术会议，专门讨论和交流了各地的棉花丰产经验，并制定了争取今年棉花大丰收的具体措施。各植棉区又根据当地自然条件和妨碍棉花获得更高产量的关键性问题，制定了当地植棉的详细措施。玛纳斯垦区最近已将经各级党委书记、场长、技术人员、植棉能手共同研究制定的植棉措施，印成详细材料，发给各生产队参考。吐鲁番县已成立了由技术人员和植棉能手组成的棉花种植讲习团，深入各生产队，轮回传授植棉技术。
    各地种籽部门和商业机构，也大大加强了对棉区的良种普及和物质供应工作，大批农药和化肥已优先运往各植棉地区。
    本报讯　新疆重点植棉地区——玛纳斯河流域和塔里木等地六十多个植棉军垦农场，正在普遍改装播棉机，推广横向间苗法，保证棉田不漏行不断行和出苗整齐。横向间苗法是今年新疆各农场植棉技术的一项重大改革，普遍推广这种间苗法后，就能大大减轻繁重体力劳动，提高棉花产量，降低生产成本。
    今年，各植棉农场的棉花播种面积将比去年扩大一倍左右，单位面积产量也要求大大超过去年。如果沿用原来的耕作方法，势必要增加成倍的劳动力，加大成本。为了争取大面积丰产，今年元月初，这几十个农场就全面总结了近年来的植棉经验，积极从提高劳动生产率、改进耕作方法等方面着手，以解决劳力不足的矛盾，并且决定全面推广横向间苗这一重大技术措施。但是，实行这项改革首先必须保证棉花播种质量，使棉田不漏行、不断行、出苗整齐，才能保证横向间苗后每亩保留足够的株数，因此，播前训练工作十分重要。目前，各植棉农场一面加紧备耕，一面积极训练植棉人材，并且使棉花播种和横向间苗的技术训练同时进行。四千多名拖拉机手和农具员，采取边检修机器边练习的办法，正在迅速掌握棉花播种和横向间苗的耕作方法，学会安装和调整这些机具。各农场还将通过严格的考工测验制度，使新老驾驶员经过实地操作考试，提高操作水平，尽快投入植棉生产。
    横向间苗是比较先进的一项植棉耕作方法。这种方法主要是在条播的基础上，用机器或畜力牵引中耕器作横向铲苗，然后稍加人工定植，使棉田形成六十厘米的方形行距。近几年来，各农场试行的结果，不仅使繁重的人工间苗劳动由机器或畜力所代替，而且由于行距呈方形，可以纵横中耕、除草，减少了人工松土和人工拔草等作业，大大提高了劳动生产效率。据玛纳斯河流域两个植棉农场调查：实行横向间苗，每亩可减少人工43％，成本降低40％左右，管理定额可由每人十五亩提高到二十五亩和二十七亩。更重要的是耕作不误农时，实行横向间苗每个农场只要三、四天就可结束间苗工作；而用人工间苗，由于效率低、春耕劳力紧张或棉田分散等原因，不少农场往往要延长十多天甚至一个月，不能及时中耕，严重地影响棉花的正常生长。实行横向间苗的棉田，中耕、除草、追肥等的次数要比人工间苗的棉田多三次；用人工间苗的棉田，只能顺苗行作纵向中耕，每亩地耕到的地方只有58％，而横向间苗的棉田，由于能纵横交错进行中耕，耕到的地方可以提高到83％以上，有效地促使棉花的梐株和根系发育良好，脱落率一般每亩可以降低7．2％，产量也比一般人工间苗的棉田每亩高十多斤籽棉，而且可以提早三四天成熟。
