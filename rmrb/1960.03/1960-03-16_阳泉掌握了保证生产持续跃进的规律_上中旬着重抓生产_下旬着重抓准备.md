(Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 15th) The factories and mining enterprises in Yangquan City, Shanxi Province, have adopted the working method of "focusing on production in the first and middle ten days of the month and focusing on preparation in the last ten days of the month," completely changing the old "routine" of low production at the beginning of the month in the past, and ensuring that production continues to leap forward wave after wave. According to statistics up to March 10, the city's production level has increased by 20.18% compared with the level in the fourth quarter of last year.

The Yangquan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China regarded changing the "routine" of low industrial production at the beginning of the month as a revolution in leading industrial production this year. As early as December last year, the Municipal Party Committee organized a working group to conduct inspections of various types of enterprises in the city to find the law of better continuous leaps forward. The results of the inspection revealed that the practices of many enterprises in the past mainly involved carrying out preparation work such as equipment maintenance, discussing plans, producing spare parts, and workers' rotations at the beginning of the month. Therefore, production could not be increased at the beginning of the month, which caused difficulties in the middle and last ten days of the month, directly affecting the completion of the monthly production plan. The Municipal Party Committee believed that this "routine" of low production at the beginning of the month was artificial and could be completely changed, with the key being leadership. Immediately afterwards, the Municipal Party Committee put forward the call to make production preparations in advance in late December for a good start to production in January. As a result, in the first and middle ten days of January, the city's major industrial products completed about 70% of the monthly tasks, greatly gaining the initiative. In the last ten days of the month, enterprises organized both overproduction and concentrated their efforts on carrying out various preparations for production in February. For example, in the late January, Yinying Iron Plant engaged in large-scale production preparation work, in addition to storing a large amount of ore raw materials, they also carried out large-scale ore roasting, so that the iron content of the ore reached 80%. In addition, they also carried out a comprehensive technical transformation of the blast furnace's air supply, gas, and raw material systems, which enabled the monthly production to gradually increase in February. The average utilization coefficient of the blast furnace reached above four in the whole month, and exceeded five on average in the last ten days of the month, completely reversing the old "routine". The Yangquan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, from the experience of summarizing production in January, found the new law of "focusing on production in the first and middle ten days of the month and focusing on preparation in the last ten days of the month" to ensure continuous leaps forward, making people's subjective understanding more adapted to the objective. Of course, this new law was not mastered by people from the beginning. Only through mobilizing the masses to speak out, debate, and analyze the reasons did all enterprises in the city unify their understanding.

The practice of Yangquan for more than two months has proven that enterprises that have implemented this approach have proactive leadership work, and production is always ahead. Other tasks such as technical innovation, workers' lives, hygiene, and sports are also carried out well. Workers have both work and rest, which further promotes production and achieves sustained leaps forward. Conversely, production cannot be increased, and all tasks lag behind. Yangquan Machinery Factory and Yangquan Iron and Steel Factory are a clear contrast. Yangquan Machinery Factory, due to the implementation of the working method of focusing on preparation in the last ten days of the month, production rose every ten days, and monthly tasks were completed ahead of schedule. After completing the production plan in full thirteen days ahead of schedule in January, the February plan was completed twelve days ahead of schedule, and increased by more than 4.4% compared with January. As production gained the initiative, other tasks were ahead of schedule. The factory's first-quarter technical innovation plan was completed one month ahead of schedule, creating and innovating a large number of mechanical equipment, and 70% of the factory's operations were mechanized and semi-mechanized. At the same time, the factory's cultural activities, sports, and hygiene work are also among the best units in the city. Workers are in a good mood, and the attendance rate often remains above 96%, which further promotes the development of production. Although Yangquan Iron and Steel Factory completed the production plan in January, it did not seize the preparation work. The reserve of ore was small and the grade was low, and other tasks did not keep up. Production and work were passive, and the production plan of pig iron in February was only 92% completed. The factory seized the preparation work in late February, and the situation immediately improved. In the first ten days of March, the steel production level increased by more than one time compared with the average daily production level in February, and the blast furnace utilization coefficient was also greatly improved. Now, all factories and mines are more consciously implementing the working method of "focusing on production in the first and middle ten days of the month and focusing on preparation in the last ten days of the month."

Production preparation work must be carried out comprehensively in all aspects such as ideology, planning, technology, and labor organization. This is an important experience of the Yangquan City industrial and mining enterprises. The practice of several months has proven that only by grasping all aspects comprehensively can they be organically combined and better promote production. Now, the production plans of various units are generally issued in the middle of the previous month, and workers are organized to discuss them. Then, according to the determined plan, raw materials are prepared and spare parts are produced, and the maintenance of mechanical equipment is arranged in daily progress according to the specific situation of production.

### 阳泉掌握了保证生产持续跃进的规律  上中旬着重抓生产  下旬着重抓准备

    阳泉掌握了保证生产持续跃进的规律
    上中旬着重抓生产  下旬着重抓准备
    本报太原15日电　山西省阳泉市各厂矿企业采取“上中两旬着重抓生产，下旬着重抓准备”的工作方法，彻底改变了过去月初生产低的旧“常规”，保证了生产一浪高一浪地持续跃进。根据到3月10日为止的统计，全市生产水平比去年第四季度的水平提高了20．18％。
    中共阳泉市委把改变工业生产月初低的“常规”，当作今年领导工业生产上的一场革命。早在去年12月，市委就组织工作组对全市不同类型的企业进行了考察，找寻更好地持续跃进的规律；考察的结果，发现过去不少企业的做法，主要是把设备维修、讨论计划、备品备件生产以及工人轮休等准备工作，都在月初进行，因此月初生产上不去，给中下旬造成了困难，直接影响到全月生产计划的完成。市委认为这种月初生产低的“常规”是人为的，完全可以改变，关键的问题在于领导。紧接着，市委提出在12月下旬提前为1月生产开门红做好生产准备的号召，结果，1月份的上、中两旬，全市各主要工业产品都完成了全月任务的70％左右，大大争得了主动；到下旬，各企业就一面组织超产，一面集中力量为2月生产进行各项准备工作。例如，荫营铁厂在1月下旬大搞生产准备工作中，除储备了大量的矿石原料外，并大搞矿石焙烧，使矿石的含铁量达到了80％。此外，他们还对小高炉的送风、煤气、原料系统进行了全盘的技术改造，这样就使2月份生产逐旬提高，全月小高炉的平均利用系数达到四以上，并在下旬平均超过了五，彻底扭转了旧“常规”。中共阳泉市委从总结1月份生产的经验中，找到了“上中两旬着重抓生产，下旬着重抓准备”这个保证持续跃进的新规律，使人的主观更加适应了客观。当然，这个新的规律并不是一开始就被人们所掌握，全市各企业通过发动群众鸣放辩论，分析原因，才统一了认识。
    阳泉两个多月来的实践证明，凡是贯彻了这种做法的企业，领导工作就主动，生产步步赶在前面，其他各项工作如技术革新、工人生活、卫生、体育等也都开展得好，工人有劳有逸，更加促进了生产，取得了持续的跃进。反之，生产就上不去，各项工作都落后一步。阳泉机械厂和阳泉钢铁厂就是一个明显的对比。阳泉机械厂由于贯彻了下旬着重抓准备的工作方法，生产逐旬上升，月月提前完成任务。1月份提前十三天全面完成生产计划后，2月计划又提前十二天完成，并且比1月份提高4．4％以上。由于生产争得了主动，其他各项工作都赶在了前面，全厂第一季度的技术革新规划提前一个月完成，创造和革新了大批机械设备，全厂70％的操作实现了机械化和半机械化。同时，这个厂的文艺活动、体育、卫生工作也是全市较好的单位，工人心情舒畅，出勤率经常保持在96％以上，从而又促进了生产的发展。阳泉钢铁厂在1月虽然完成了生产计划，但是却没有抓住准备工作，矿石的储备少、品位低，其他各项工作也没有跟上去，生产、工作都被动，2月份生铁的生产计划只完成了92％多。这个厂2月下旬抓紧了准备工作，情况就立即好转，3月上旬钢的生产水平比2月平均日产水平提高一倍多，高炉利用系数也有很大提高。现在，各厂矿都更加自觉地贯彻“上中两旬着重抓生产，下旬着重抓准备”的工作方法。
    生产准备工作必须从思想、计划、技术、劳动组织等各个方面全面进行，这是阳泉市各工矿企业的一条重要经验。几个月的实践证明，只有全面抓，才能有机地结合起来，更好地促进生产。现在，各单位的生产计划一般都在上月中旬下达，组织工人讨论，然后根据确定的计划，准备原材料和进行备品、备件的生产；并对机械设备的维修，按生产的具体情况排好日进度。
