Thinking of the Grassroots Cadres
Chen Hua

During the Great Leap Forward, many unforgettable people and events were left behind. Among the many unforgettable people and events, I often cannot help but think of the grassroots cadres who worked in the countryside. No matter when I think of our grassroots cadres, my heart is always so uneasy, feeling so much encouragement, feeling that our cause is so glorious and brilliant.

Our party's countless grassroots cadres are loyal to the cause of the party; they lead thousands upon thousands of people, closely following the party, rushing forward in the direction the party points. For our brilliant cause, they stayed up many sleepless nights, their eyes bloodshot; whether it was a storm, blizzard, or scorching heat, whether it was high mountains, muddy riverbanks, or pathless wilderness; whether it was day or night, their footprints could be found.

The Party said to reform agricultural tools. So they reformed agricultural tools together with the masses. The Party said to prepare a large amount of fertilizer for the crops. So they, together with the masses, piled fertilizer all over the fields. The crops grew. The Party said to have a bumper harvest. So they simply built small sheds to live in the fields, counting the grains of rice growing on the crops. If anyone opposed socialism, they were straightforward and mobilized the masses at once to carry out an unambiguous struggle. The Party is the truth, and they are the embodiment of thousands of truths.

Comrade Zhou Youren, deputy secretary of the Party Committee of Gaomiao People's Commune in Hanyang County, Hubei, encountered a drought when he first arrived at the Gaomiao People's Commune. Zhou Youren went to a production team where the drought was most severe. Some people in the production team pessimistically said, "We are finished this year!" After Zhou Youren arrived at the production team, he understood the situation and analyzed the favorable conditions for the commune members, saying, "The water hasn't stopped yet, and the commune has great strength, so we can have great cooperation. The rice hasn't formed buds yet, so it can be saved completely." After his analysis, everyone gained confidence. At the same time, Zhou Youren organized other production teams to cooperate and led the way in digging ditches and pumping water day and night for a month and eight days. Later, after a small rain, some people became complacent and said, "After a long drought, there must be a long rain, so we don't need to pump water anymore." Zhou Youren told everyone again that according to the weather forecast from the weather station, the drought would continue, and asked everyone to trust science and fill the ponds. Sure enough, after the fields and ponds were filled with water, there was another drought for more than a month. Because there was plenty of water in the ponds, the production team had a bumper harvest of rice, planted more than 30 mu of vegetables, and raised more than 10,000 fish. That year, the production team had a great harvest. The masses said: Thanks to the Party for sending Secretary Zhou to lead us so well!

Good grassroots cadres like Comrade Zhou Youren are countless on all our fronts!

In the past, there was a popular saying in Yan'an: "Above are the Central Committee, below are the cadres, so we are not afraid of the sky falling or the earth collapsing." Cadres mainly refer to grassroots cadres. At that time, there was still the question of whether the sky would fall. This question no longer exists now. No matter what tricks or ploys the imperialists are playing, the sky and the earth will certainly not collapse. But the significance of this sentence has not disappeared. That is to say, under the sky of truth embodied in our Party, we see from our grassroots cadres a style of new people who exist alongside heaven and earth and become one with our Party. This style of new people is expanding among the people day by day, making us confident in the complete victory of socialism and communism.

    想起了基层干部
    陈华
    大跃进当中，留下了许多令人难忘的人和事。在许许多多难忘的人和事当中，我常常不能不想起我们在农村工作的基层干部。不管什么时候，想起我们的基层干部，心里总是这样不能平静，感到这样多的激励，感到我们的事业是这样光辉灿烂。
    我们党的无数基层干部，他们对党的事业忠心耿耿；他们带领着千千万万的群众，紧紧跟着党，朝着党指引的方向飞奔前进。为了我们的灿烂的事业，他们在那些不眠的夜里熬红了双眼；不管是狂风暴雨、冰天雪地，或者是烈日酷暑，不管是高山峻岭、泥泞的河滩，或者是无路的荒野；也不管是日是夜，都可以寻到他们奔走的足迹。
    党说，要改革农具。他们就和群众一起改革了农具。党说，要给庄稼准备大量的肥料。他们就和群众一起，使肥料堆满了所有的田地。庄稼长出来了。党说，叫庄稼来个大丰收。于是他们就索性搭个小棚住到田地里，数着一颗颗谷粒从庄稼上长出来。要是谁反对社会主义，他们就老实不客气，把群众一下子发动起来，开展毫不含糊的斗争。党是真理，他们就是千万个真理的化身。
    湖北汉阳县高庙人民公社的党委副书记周友仁同志，刚到高庙人民公社工作的时候，正碰着天旱。周友仁下到旱情最严重的一个生产队去。生产队里有些人悲观地说：“我们今年完了！”周友仁到生产队以后，了解了各种情况，就给社员们分析有利条件，对社员们说：“水还没有断，公社力量大，可以大协作，谷子没打苞，完全可以救。”经他这么一分析，大家都有了信心。同时，周友仁一面组织其他生产队进行协作，一面日夜带头开沟、车水，接连干了一个月零八天。后来，下了一次小雨，有些人又产生了麻痹情绪，说：“久晴必有久雨，可以不车水了。”周友仁又对大家说，根据气象站的天气预报，天还要旱，叫大家相信科学，一定要把塘灌满。果然，把田里和塘里车满了水后，又接连旱了一个多月。由于塘水多，生产队的水稻丰收了，还种了三十多亩地的菜，养了一万多尾鱼。这一年，生产队获得了大丰收。群众说：多亏党把周书记派来，领导得好呵！
    像周友仁同志这样的好基层干部，在我们的各个战线上，成千上万，真是不可胜数！
    过去在延安的时候曾经流行过这样一句话：上有中央、下有干部，不怕天塌地复。干部，主要也就是指基层干部。那时候，天地还存在着塌不塌的问题。这个问题现在没有了。不管帝国主义还在玩什么手腕，耍什么花样，天和地肯定是塌不下来的了。但是这句话的意义现在仍然没有消失。就是说，在我们党所体现的真理的天空下面，从我们的基层干部身上，使我们看到一种与天地并存、和我们的党化为一体的新人的风格。这种新人的风格在人们当中正在一天天扩大起来，使我们确信社会主义、共产主义的彻底的胜利。
