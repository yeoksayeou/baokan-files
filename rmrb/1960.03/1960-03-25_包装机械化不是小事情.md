Packaging is the final step in the entire production process of a factory. In light industrial factories, this step is typically done manually, resulting in low efficiency and high labor costs. Taking light industry as an example, packaging workers for sweets, cigarettes, toothpaste, soap, and other products usually account for more than half of all production workers. In the daily chemical industry, packaging workers can account for 80% to 90% of all production workers. Manual packaging involves repeating the same actions all day, and the labor is also heavy. For some products, such as sewing needles and biscuits, neglecting cleanliness can affect product quality and hygiene due to manual packaging. Especially today, with technical innovation and the technological revolution flourishing everywhere and production constantly leaping forward, manual packaging falls far short of meeting the needs of increased production. Manual packaging must be changed quickly; using machine packaging is imperative today.

Some people believe that the packaging process is not a major process. In the past, there were very few packaging machines, and there was nothing readily available to imitate. In addition, most packaging workers do not understand machinery and have never even touched a machine, so how can they build machines? Others believe that packaging machines are different from other machines. To pack a piece of candy or a pack of cigarettes requires more than a dozen or even dozens of movements. Products come in various shapes, square and round, solid and liquid, and some are sticky, making it difficult to pack them with machines. Is this really the case? No, since ancient times, all tools have been created by humans. It is true that packaging machines are complex, but that does not mean we cannot manufacture them. Since the Great Leap Forward, haven't we manufactured many machines that never existed before? As for saying that packaging workers who do not understand machinery or have never touched a machine cannot build machines, that is even more untenable. Packaging workers have accumulated rich operational experience in production practice and are familiar with packaging requirements. Coupled with their strong desire to get rid of heavy manual packaging labor, as long as we organize them, give full play to their creativity and enthusiasm, and provide more support and assistance, they will definitely create various packaging machines. Most of the more than 30 types of packaging machines that have recently appeared in Shanghai's light industry were researched and developed by packaging workers themselves or after consulting with packaging workers. This fact powerfully illustrates that as long as we trust the masses and rely closely on the masses, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome.

Achieving the mechanization of manual packaging is a very important part of the current technical innovation and technological revolution in light industry and other industries, and it is also an urgent task for factories with a large proportion of manual packaging. Although this work has attracted attention from all parties and some achievements have been made, it is only the beginning. The task is still very heavy and far from meeting the requirements of the production leap forward. For example, packaging machines for some products have not yet been fully developed, and some successfully developed packaging machines have not yet been fully promoted. This requires light industrial factory workers to continue to work hard and resolutely implement the policy of walking on two legs, combining indigenous and foreign methods to create more packaging machines, and rapidly promoting packaging machines that have been manufactured and proven effective through testing.

### 包装机械化不是小事情

    包装机械化不是小事情
    包装，在工厂整个生产过程中是最后一道工序，而这道工序在轻工业工厂里可都是用手工操作的，效率低，占用人工多。以轻工业为例，糖果、香烟、牙膏、肥皂等包装工人一般要占全部生产工人一半多，在日用化学工业中，包装工人有的要占全部生产工人80％到90％。手工包装，整天重复着相同的动作，劳动也很繁重。有些产品如缝衣针、饼干等，如果不注意清洁卫生，还会因为手工包装而影响产品的质量和卫生条件。尤其是在技术革新和技术革命遍地开花，生产不断跃进的今天，手工包装就远远不能适应生产增长的需要。手工包装，必须迅速改变；用机器包装，在今天已经势在必行。
    有些人认为：包装工序不是什么主要工序，过去包装机器一直很少，没有什么现成的东西可仿效，加上包装工人大都不懂机械，甚至连机器都没有摸过，怎么能造机器呢？还有人认为：包装机和别的机器不一样，包一包糖、一包香烟，要做十多个动作，甚至几十个动作。产品有方有圆，有固体有液体，有的还有粘性，要用机器来包，实在困难。事实是否这样呢？不，自古以来，任何工具都是人创造出来的，包装机复杂是事实，但这不等于说我们就不能制造。大跃进以来，我们不是制造了许多从来没有过的机器吗？至于说包装工人不懂机械或没有摸过机器就不能造机器，更不能成立了。包装工人在生产实践中积累了丰富的操作经验，熟悉包装的要求，加上他们有着摆脱繁重手工包装体力劳动的强烈愿望，只要把他们组织起来，发挥他们的创造性积极性，给予更多的支持和帮助，就一定会造出各种各样的包装机。上海轻工业中最近出现的三十多种包装机，绝大部分都是包装工人自己动手或征求了包装工人的意见才研究成功的。这个事实有力地说明：只要我们相信群众，紧紧依靠群众，就没有克服不了的困难。
    实现手工包装机械化，是当前轻工业等行业技术革新和技术革命的一个十分重要的内容，更是那些手工包装比重较大的工厂的一个迫切任务。现在这项工作虽已引起各方面的重视，而且做出了一些成绩，但还仅仅是开始，任务还很繁重，离生产跃进的要求还很远。如有些产品的包装机还没有完全研究成功，研究成功的包装机有的还没有全面推广。这就要求轻工业工厂职工继续努力，坚决贯彻两条腿走路的方针。土洋结合，创制更多的包装机器，把已经制成并且经过试验证明有效的包装机器，迅速推广。
