Expanding Planting Area　Using All Improved Varieties　Applying Large Amounts of Base Fertilizer
Jilin and Liaoning Intensify Preparations for Soybean Sowing

    (Our Newspaper Dispatch) Jilin Province, a major soybean producing area in China, is actively carrying out preparations for soybean sowing, striving to take soybean production to a new level this year.
    In order to ensure timely early sowing of soybeans, all localities began harrowing and pressing autumn-plowed land in early February. The soybean fields in Changchun, Siping, Baicheng and other areas have generally been harrowed and pressed once. Sufficient fertilizer has been prepared for soybean fields throughout the province, with more than 30 to 40 tons of base fertilizer applied per hectare, a significant increase compared to previous years. Bacterial fertilizer plants run by counties (cities) and people's communes are vigorously producing azotobacter (i.e., rhizobia), which will be universally used to treat soybean seeds before sowing. Many places have also stored phosphorus and potassium fertilizers for topdressing. This year, the preparation of soybean seeds is both plentiful and of high quality. More than 66,000 tons of soybean seeds have been selected throughout the province, which not only meets the sowing needs to the greatest extent, but also leaves a reserve. This year, the province has basically achieved the use of improved varieties for all soybeans. The total area of high-yield soybean fields in the province will increase by 30% to 40% compared to last year. The experience of increasing soybean production last year has been summarized and exchanged in all counties, and pacesetters in soybean production have been established throughout the province. Wang Yuxian, the Party General Branch Secretary of the Taishang Management Area of the Taishang People's Commune in Ji'an County, a model of high-yield soybean production, has become an example for farmers throughout the province to learn from, catch up with, and surpass in soybean planting.
    For this year's soybean production, Party organizations at all levels throughout the province have adopted effective measures to ensure the completion of the soybean sowing plan. At present, the soybean production plan has been implemented to the production teams. From the perspective of the implementation of the plan, the soybean sowing area greatly exceeds the national plan. The broad masses of farmers fully realize that increasing soybean production is their own unshirkable and glorious duty, and they have expressed their determination to plant more soybeans and strive for high yields. All localities have also focused on measures to increase soybean production during the preparation for cultivation. Based on the experience of increasing production in 1959, this year, we will focus on grasping the two links with greater potential for increasing production: rational close planting and timely early sowing. To this end, all localities will completely change the backward sowing method of manual broadcasting, and instead implement the advanced sowing methods of hole-drilling and using seeders to first flat-sow and then ridge.
    Shenyang, 16th. Preparations for soybean sowing in Liaoning are earlier and better than in previous years. The seeds needed for more than 10 million mu of soybean sowing in the province have all been selected and prepared, all of which are excellent varieties, with a germination rate of over 95%. The amount of fertilizer applied per mu of soybean field is generally doubled compared to last year. At present, all localities are stepping up the leveling and harrowing of land, striving for timely early sowing.
    In order to increase the production of more soybeans to support national construction, the people's communes in various localities have grasped the preparation for soybean sowing earlier, more tightly, and better. As early as during the autumn harvest last year, the people's communes in various localities launched a seed selection and retention movement centered on the fine seed breeding farms. The seeds selected and retained by the communes were not only sufficient for their own sowing needs this year, but also transferred millions of catties to support other provinces. The seeds selected and retained in various localities are all regional fine varieties cultivated over many years, such as "Fengdihuang", "Mandijin", "Xiaojinhuang No. 1," "Collective No. 1," and "Collective No. 2," and various local fine varieties comparable to them. These fine varieties can increase production by more than 10% compared to the ordinary varieties in the local area in the past. In order to ensure the purity of fine varieties, all localities have universally carried out careful selection and review during the preparation for cultivation.
    After many places summarized the experience of increasing production through timely early sowing in the past, this year they put forward the slogan of "soybeans should be on an equal footing with other miscellaneous grain crops in spring sowing", changing the practice of planting soybeans after miscellaneous grain crops in the past.
    In order to achieve an all-round bumper harvest of soybeans, based on the investigation and summary of last year's soybean bumper harvest experience, various localities have formulated technical production increase plans for soybeans level by level according to local conditions, and have universally trained technical backbones. They are preparing to comprehensively innovate soybean cultivation techniques with the large-scale establishment of high-yield demonstration fields as the center, and on the basis of sufficient water and fertilizer, further promote rational close planting, vigorously promote the experience of intercropping, mixed cropping, and interplanting to increase production, and strengthen the field management of soybeans throughout the year, striving for a greater bumper harvest of soybeans.

### 扩大种植面积　全部选用良种　大量增施底肥  吉林辽宁加紧准备大豆播种

    扩大种植面积　全部选用良种　大量增施底肥
    吉林辽宁加紧准备大豆播种
    本报讯　我国主要大豆产区吉林省，正积极进行大豆播种的准备工作，力争今年大豆生产更上一层楼。
    为了保证大豆适时早种，各地于2月初已普遍开始耙压秋耕地。长春、四平、白城等地区的大豆田已普遍耙压了一遍。全省各地大豆田准备了充足的肥料，每公顷施基肥三、四十吨以上，施肥量比往年有显著增加。各县（市）和人民公社自办的细菌肥料厂，正在大力生产固氮菌（即根瘤菌），在大豆播种前普遍用固氮菌拌种。许多地方还贮备了磷钾质肥料，以备追肥使用。今年大豆种子准备的又多又好。全省选出大豆种六万六千多吨，不仅能最大限度地满足播种需要，而且还留有后备。今年全省大豆已基本实现了良种化。全省大面积大豆丰产田将比去年增加30％到40％。在各县普遍总结和交流了去年大豆增产经验，全省树立了大豆生产标兵。大豆丰产模范——辑安县台上人民公社台上管理区党总支书记王玉贤，已成为全省农民在种大豆方面学、赶、超的一个榜样。
    今年的大豆生产，全省各级党的组织采取有效措施，保证完成大豆播种计划。目前，大豆生产计划已经落实到生产队。从计划落实的情况来看，大豆播种面积大大超过国家计划。广大农民充分认识到增产大豆是自己义不容辞的光荣义务，纷纷表示一定要多种大豆并力争高产。各地在备耕中还狠抓大豆增产措施。根据1959年增产经验，今年要突出的抓住增产潜力较大的合理密植和适时早播两个环节。为此，各地将彻底改变用手工撒种的落后播种方法，而全部实行扎眼播种和用播种机先平播后起垅的先进播种方法。
    沈阳16日电　今年辽宁各地大豆播种准备工作比往年进行得又早又好。全省一千多万亩大豆播种所需要的种子已经全部选好备足，百分之百都是优良品种，发芽率都在95％以上。每亩大豆田的单位施肥量普遍比去年增加一倍左右。目前各地正在抓紧平整耙压土地，力争适时早播。
    各地人民公社为了增产更多的大豆支援国家建设，对大豆播种的准备工作抓得又早又紧又好。早在去年秋收期间，各地人民公社便以良种繁殖场为中心开展了选种留种运动，各公社选留的种子不但足够今年自己播种的需要，而且还调出几百万斤支援外省。各地选留的种子全部都是“丰地黄”、“满地金”、“小金黄一号”“集体一号”、“集体二号”等经过多年培育的区域性良种和与之相媲美的各种地方良种。这些良种比当地过去的一般品种都可增产10％以上。为了保证良种的纯度，各地在备耕期间又普遍进行了精选复查。
    许多地方总结了过去适时早种的增产经验以后，今年提出了“在春播中要让大豆与其它杂粮作物平起平坐”的口号，改变过去把大豆放在杂粮作物后边播种的作法。
    为了实现大豆的全面丰收，各地在调查总结去年大豆丰产经验的基础上，因地制宜地逐级制定了大豆的技术增产方案，普遍训练了技术骨干。准备以大搞大面积丰产圃为中心全面革新大豆的栽培技术，在水足粪饱的基础上进一步推行合理密植，大力推广间、混、套种的增产经验，常年一贯地加强大豆的田间管理工作，力争大豆更大丰收。
