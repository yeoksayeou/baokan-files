New tools are really good, everyone is grabbing them. Women hold them and won't let go, and explain why: We are weak and find it difficult to carry heavy loads, this is a treasure for liberating women. Old people see them and laugh, picking up the tools and wanting to run. You want it, I want it, everyone wants it, what to do if the distribution is uneven? Everyone works together to build them, everyone uses them and the work efficiency is high.

    新式工具好新式工具真正好，你抢我夺大家要。妇女拿着不肯放，开言就把道理讲：我们力小担难挑，解放妇女它是宝。老年见了哈哈笑，拿了工具就想跑。你要我要他也要，分配不匀怎么办？人人动手大家造，个个使用工效高。
