    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 23rd. The broad masses of workers on Shanghai's industrial front are engaging in technical innovation and revolution with the spirit of the Great Leap Forward in steel production, making the technical transformation of this oldest industrial city in the country faster and faster. The outlook of enterprises is changing daily, production levels are rapidly improving, and the situation is changing with each passing day.

    This year, the city's technical innovation and technical revolution movement has been very strong, developed extremely quickly, and rapidly formed a new high tide with great momentum. The vast majority of workers in all walks of life consciously engage in innovation on a large scale. The mass mobilization is unprecedentedly broad and deep. Therefore, in a very short period of time, a situation of blooming flowers and vibrant colors in technical innovation has emerged throughout the city. According to statistics from relevant departments, as of now, industrial workers in the city have put forward a total of 1.49 million innovation proposals, of which more than 460,000 have been implemented. All sectors have manufactured more than 60,000 machines to replace manual operations, realized 6,255 single-machine automated and semi-automated units, and established 788 automated and semi-automated production lines and 2,387 production lines. A number of automated and semi-automated sections, workshops, and factories have also emerged. The high-speed and large-scale harvest of mechanization and semi-mechanization has liberated more than 200,000 workers from manual operation and heavy labor. Workers cheered this as a "second liberation" after their political and economic emancipation. After two years of continuous Great Leap Forward and the new development of technical innovation and technical revolution in the past two months of this year, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization (including automation and semi-automation) in Shanghai's industrial enterprises, calculated based on the number of workers including temporary workers and family members, has now risen to around 80%.

    The new high tide of technical innovation and technical revolution movement on Shanghai's industrial front this year is a new development of large-scale mass movement and technical revolution over the past two years. After two years of continuous Great Leap Forward, especially after opposing right-leaning tendencies and encouraging vigor, the vast majority of cadres in Shanghai's industrial departments have a higher awareness of implementing the general line, and the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act of the broad masses of workers has also become more vigorous. Therefore, at the beginning of this year, the broad masses set ambitious goals, high aspirations, and strived to be the best, determined to change the outlook of enterprises in the shortest possible time and develop production levels to a new stage. This is the firm ideological foundation for the unprecedented new high tide of technical innovation and technical revolution movement in Shanghai this year.

    In the current new high tide of technical innovation and technical revolution, the realization of mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations is progressing rapidly. Especially recently, a new scene of "industry turnaround" and large-scale harvest has emerged. Shanghai is one of the cities with the highest concentration of modern industrial enterprises in China. After several years of large-scale technical innovation and technical revolution, the degree of mechanization has been significantly improved, and the outlook of enterprises has undergone great changes. However, Shanghai still has a large number of small factories with outdated equipment; large factories also have weak links, such as in-plant transportation, loading and unloading, casting, forging, sheet metal work, fitter work, assembly, packaging, etc., where manual operation and heavy labor are still relatively common. Therefore, these aspects have become the main goals of this year's large-scale mechanization and semi-mechanization. The masses are very determined, their enthusiasm is soaring, and the changes in appearance are the most prominent. Workers who were still working with levers, pliers, and hammers yesterday are now happily operating machines; backward industries that were basically manual labor not long ago have now realized "industry turnaround," and their appearance has been renewed. In the Nanshi District, where small factories are most concentrated, twelve industries and types of work, including in-plant transportation, loading and unloading, electroplating, forging, and printing and dyeing, have basically changed the face of manual labor since the beginning of the year. As of March 8, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in more than 350 factories in the district has reached 84.94%, a sharp increase of 31.15% compared with the end of last year. The heavy machinery manufacturing industry, after more than half a month of hard work, had increased the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization to 83.3% by March 7, achieving the annual plan ahead of schedule. The face of the knitting and replication industries in the textile industry, where equipment is relatively backward, is also changing extremely quickly. After 98% of the hand-cranked glove machines in the glove industry were converted to electric power, more than half of the hand-cranked sock knitting machines in the sock industry also removed the hand cranks; factories producing towels, bed sheets, scarves, handkerchiefs, velvet blankets, etc. using hand-pulled and foot-powered looms are currently being converted into electric looms in batches. The proportion of packaging workers in the light industry system is very large, and this aspect has become the focus of large-scale mechanization and semi-mechanization. So far, packaging machines for more than 30 kinds of products such as candy, matches, toothpaste, cold cream, and pins have been created, and the effect is very good, freeing batches of packaging workers from manual operation, and also enabling many factories to save labor and change the unreasonable situation of having more packaging workers than production workers. In the iron and steel industry, a large number of modern large-scale steelmaking and steel rolling workshops have been built at high speed during the two years of the Great Leap Forward, but auxiliary departments such as in-plant transportation and loading and unloading have not been equipped in time to adapt, occupying a large amount of manpower. In this movement, iron and steel plants used a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to build mechanical equipment such as tipper trucks, five-petal grabs, derricks, and belt conveyors, freeing a large number of transportation and loading and unloading workers from manual operation and achieving a large-scale harvest.

    Greatly reforming the fate of manual operation and heavy labor, so that production leaps forward are not limited by physical strength, is the urgent desire of the broad masses. They showed great determination and tenacious will, and they said: As long as we have great ambitions, it is not a problem to move mountains and fill seas. Many workers became "innovation enthusiasts," thinking about innovation even while eating, walking, and sleeping. Leading cadres further carried forward the spirit of rectification, went deep into the masses, went to the "front line" in person, enthusiastically supported the masses, and worked with the masses to formulate plans and carry out innovation, forming a close relationship between cadres and the masses. Various industrial bureaus, companies, and district committees also held exhibitions, on-site meetings, and exchange meetings according to industry and type of work, vigorously publicizing and promoting advanced things. Therefore, a situation of rushing to change the face of many industries and factories at high speed has emerged. Lianhua Strip Steel Plant only took seven days to free the main processes of the entire plant from heavy physical labor and realize mechanization. Except for the shears car and coal addition, which still require manual operation, the rest are operated by buttons. The number of workers per shift was reduced from 45 to 17. In this revolution, the director of this plant worked with the workers for several days in a row to carry out innovation, persisting until late at night. The director repeatedly mobilized the workers to go home to rest, but the workers retorted, "You are the director, if you fall ill, there will be no one to lead the innovation," and all mobilized the director to go home to rest. After mutual mobilization by both parties, everyone later agreed to go home to rest, but they were all hiding outside for a moment and quietly returned to the factory, and as a result, they met again in the workshop. The spirit of Lianhua Strip Steel Plant in changing its face at high speed caused a huge response in the city. Zhabei Strip Steel Plant quickly caught up, working hard for more than ten days to realize semi-automation of the rolling mill, and the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of the entire plant increased from about 40% to more than 94%, and the number of workers engaged in manual operation decreased from 19 to 12. Shanghai Insulating Paper Factory originally planned to reform the fate of manual operation before National Day, but the employees increasingly felt that this plan was too slow. Within a month, they revised the plan four times in a row. Each time they revised it, they felt it was advanced, but one day later they felt it was backward. Finally, in the voice of "learning from Lianhua and catching up with Lianhua," they worked hard for five days and increased the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization from about 50% to more than 95%.

    The high-speed and large-scale harvest of mechanization and semi-mechanization has greatly improved the working conditions of workers, rapidly increased labor productivity, and enabled the production level of a large number of factories to continue to leap forward to a new stage. Sand casting has always been known as the vanguard of the mechanical industry and is the first hurdle in machine manufacturing. However, since the establishment of the sand casting industry in Shanghai, the vast majority of operations have been manual, and the physical labor is very heavy; although a lot of mechanical equipment has been built successively during the two years of the Great Leap Forward, and the output has also been greatly improved, it is still a weak link. In this new upsurge, the face of more than 300 sand casting factories (workshops) in the city has undergone fundamental changes. From knocking iron, adding materials, sand treatment, modeling, casting, opening boxes to sand removal, all processes have basically achieved mechanization and semi-mechanization. The labor intensity of workers has been greatly reduced, and the output of castings has also increased rapidly. Sand casting workers wrote poems to praise: "The mechanical industry is leaping forward, the sand casting workers are in the vanguard, the past production was too backward, bending over and squatting to model, now mechanization is realized, the back is not sore and the eyes are not blurred, the output is high and the quality is good, blooming and bearing fruit, thanking the Party." The employees of Xinya Woolen Sweater Factory worked hard for two days and three nights to electrify all 114 hand-cranked looms in the factory. Originally, one person was in charge of one machine, but now they are in charge of two, and the output has increased by 60% to 80%. He Guangxue, an old worker who had been cranking the hand crank for decades, said ambitiously on the first day of using the electric loom in the factory: "I originally thought that after working for two more years, I wouldn't be able to eat this bowl of rice anymore; now the entire factory is electrified, and I am no longer afraid of being old, and I will compete with the young people!" Kaifu Candy Factory had more than 90 female workers in manual packaging. Although the number accounted for 60% of the factory's workers, semi-finished products were often backlogged, and more than 50 people from fraternal factories were supported during the Spring Festival to make a rush. This time, the female workers broke superstition and were determined to create a "machine with long hands" on their own. Finally, they successfully developed packaging machines such as bulk sugar packing machine with two mechanical hands, fruit roll candy machine, waxing machine, and packing machine, which increased production efficiency by four to twenty times. They cheered and sang, "Labor intensity is greatly reduced, output jumps straight up, labor-saving and time-saving, the quality is excellent, many years of wishes have been realized, everyone in the factory is smiling."

    During this period, Shanghai's technical innovation and technical revolution movement not only changed the face of labor and improved the level of production, but also further liberated people's minds, making the movement develop more widely and deeply wave after wave. The workers and masses of many factories and enterprises are summing up the results of innovation in the spirit of continuous revolution, so that mechanized and semi-mechanized equipment is constantly improved and continuously improved. They set lofty ambitions and are determined to realize mechanization and semi-mechanization in all production departments that can be done without manual operation within the year, so as to accelerate the improvement of labor productivity. At the same time, the broad masses of employees are also vigorously carrying out process reforms, tool reforms, and equipment reforms, as well as boldly adopting new processes and new technologies. A mass upsurge of fiercely attacking high-level precision and cutting-edge products, manufacturing first-class quality products, and vigorously carrying out raw material conservation and comprehensive utilization of materials has also emerged. At present, the technical innovation and technical revolution movement in the city is continuing to develop rapidly. (Attached picture)

    上海市技术大改造波澜壮阔瞬息万变
    机械化半机械化程度上升到80％左右，企业面貌日新月异生产水平迅速提高
    二十万工人摆脱手工操作和笨重劳动，欢呼这是政治和经济翻身后的“第二次解放”
    本报上海23日电　上海工业战线上广大职工群众，正以大炼钢铁的劲头大闹技术革新和技术革命，使这个全国最老的工业城市的技术改造愈来愈快，企业面貌日新月异，生产水平迅速提高，形势一日千里，瞬息万变。
    今年，全市技术革新、技术革命运动来势很猛，发展极快，迅速形成声势浩大的新高潮。各行各业绝大多数职工群众自觉地大搞革新，群众发动的广泛、深入空前未有，因此，在很短时期内，全市就出现了技术革新百花齐放、万紫千红的局面。据有关部门的统计，到目前为止，全市工业职工共提出革新建议一百四十九万件，实现了四十六万多件。各行各业已制造出代替手工操作的机械六万多台，实现单机自动化半自动化六千二百五十五台，出现自动半自动流水线七百八十八条、生产流水线二千三百八十七条，还出现了一批自动化半自动化的工段、车间和工厂。机械化半机械化的高速度、大面积丰收，已经使二十多万工人从手工操作和笨重劳动中解放出来。工人们欢呼这是在政治上、经济上翻身以后的“第二次解放”。经过两年连续大跃进和今年两个多月来技术革新、技术革命的新发展，上海全市工业企业机械化半机械化（包括自动化半自动化）程度，按包括临时工和家属在内的工人人数计算，目前已上升到80％左右。
    今年上海工业战线的技术革新、技术革命运动新高潮，是两年来大搞群众运动、大闹技术革命的新发展。经过两年来连续大跃进，特别是经过反右倾、鼓干劲，上海工业部门广大干部贯彻执行总路线的自觉性更高，广大工人群众敢想敢说敢作的共产主义风格也更加高涨。因此，今年一开始，广大群众就树雄心，立大志，争上游，攀高峰，决心在尽可能短的时间内改变企业面貌，使生产水平发展到一个新阶段。这就是今年上海技术革新、技术革命运动出现空前新高潮的坚定的思想基础。
    在当前技术革新和技术革命的新高潮中，实现手工操作机械化半机械化进展很快。特别是最近一个时期，更出现了“行业翻身”、大面积丰收的新景象。上海是我国现代化工业企业最集中的城市之一，经过几年来大搞技术革新和技术革命，机械化程度已有显著提高，企业面貌已有很大变化。但是，上海还有大批设备陈旧的小厂；大厂也存在薄弱环节，例如在厂内运输装卸、翻砂、锻造、冷作、钳工、装配、包装等方面，手工操作和笨重劳动还比较多。因此，这些方面也就成为今年大搞机械化半机械化的主要目标，群众决心很大，干劲冲天，面貌改变也最为突出。昨天还是手拿杠棒、钳子、鎯头干活的工人，今天已欢天喜地地操纵机器；不久以前还基本上是手工劳动的落后行业，现在已实现了“行业翻身”，面貌为之一新。小厂最集中的南市区，从年初以来就有厂内运输装卸、电镀、锻造、印染等十二个行业和工种，基本上改变了手工劳动的面貌，到3月8日为止，全区三百五十多个工厂的机械化半机械化程度已达到84．94％，比去年年底猛增31．15％。重型机械制造行业，经过半个多月的奋战，到3月7日已把机械化半机械化程度提高到83．3％，提前实现了全年规划。纺织工业中设备较落后的针织、复制等行业，面貌改变也极快。在手套行业98％的手摇手套机改为电动化以后，制袜行业也有一半以上的手摇织袜机革掉手摇柄；用手拉脚踏的人力织机生产毛巾、被单、围巾、手帕、绒毯等工厂，目前也在成批地改装为电动织机。轻工业系统中包装工人所占的比重很大，这方面就成为大搞机械化半机械化的重点，到目前为止已经创造出了包装糖果、火柴、牙膏、冷霜、大头针等三十多种产品的包装机，效果很好，使成批的包装工人摆脱手工操作，同时也使许多工厂节约了劳动力，改变了包装工人多于生产工人的不合理状况。钢铁工业在两年来大跃进中高速度地兴建了大批现代化的大型炼钢、轧钢车间，而厂内运输装卸等辅助部门还来不及相适应地装备起来，占用了大量的人力。这次运动中，各钢铁厂用土洋结合的办法，大造翻斗车、五花抓斗、扒杆、皮带运输机等机械设备，使大批运输装卸工人摆脱了手工操作，获得了大面积丰收。
    大革手工操作和笨重劳动的命，使生产跃进不受体力的限制，是广大群众的迫切愿望。他们表现了巨大的决心和顽强的意志，他们表示：只要咱们雄心大，移山填海也不在话下。很多工人成了“革新迷”，吃饭、走路、睡觉也想着革新。领导干部进一步发扬了整风精神，深入群众，亲临“前线”，满腔热情地支持群众，和群众一起订规划，一起搞革新，结成了水乳交融的干群关系。各工业局、公司和各区委，也纷纷按行业按工种举办展览会，召开现场会、交流会，大力宣扬和推广先进事物。因此，许多行业和工厂出现了高速度改变面貌的争先恐后的形势。联华带钢厂仅以七天的时间，就使全厂的主要工序摆脱了繁重的体力劳动，实现了机械化，除了剪刀车和加煤还需要人工操作外，其余的都用电钮操纵了。工人从四十五人一班减少到十七人一班。在这一场革命中，这个厂的厂长连续几天和工人一起搞革新，坚持到深夜，厂长多次动员工人回家休息，工人反说：“你是厂长，病倒了没有人领导革新”，都动员厂长回家休息。经过双方相互动员，后来大家都答应回家休息，但他们都是在外面躲藏片刻，又悄悄回到厂里，结果又在车间里见面了。联华带钢厂高速度改变面貌的精神，在全市引起巨大的反响。闸北带钢厂急起直追，大干十多天，实现了轧钢机半自动化，全厂机械化半机械化程度从40％左右提高到94％以上，从事手工操作的工人从十九人减少到十二人。上海绝缘纸厂本来规划国庆节前革掉手工操作的命，但职工们愈来愈感到这个规划太慢了，在一个月之内，接连四次修订规划，每次修改时都觉得是先进的，但过一天又感到落后了。最后，他们在“学联华、赶联华”声中，奋战五天，就把机械化半机械化程度从50％左右提高到95％以上。
    机械化半机械化的高速度、大面积丰收，已经大大改善了工人的劳动条件，迅速提高了劳动生产率，使大批工厂生产水平继续跃进到一个新的阶段。翻砂一向被称为机械工业的先锋，是机器制造的第一关。但上海自从有翻砂行业以来，绝大多数都是手工操作，体力劳动很繁重；在两年来大跃进中，虽然已陆续搞了不少机械设备，产量也有很大提高，但仍然是一个薄弱环节。在这次新高潮中，全市三百多家翻砂工厂（车间）的面貌起了根本的变化，从敲铁、加料、型砂处理、造型、浇铸、开箱到清砂等工序，都已经基本上实现了机械化半机械化，工人劳动强度大大减轻，铸件产量也迅速提高。翻砂工人作诗歌颂：“机械工业大跃进，翻砂工人做先锋，过去生产太落后，弯腰屈膝来造型，现在实现机械化，腰不酸来眼不花，产量高来质量好，开花结果感谢党。”新亚羊毛衫厂职工大干两天三夜，使全厂一百十四台手摇织机实现电动化，原来一人挡一台，现在挡二台，产量增加60％到80％。扳了几十年手摇柄的老工人何光学，在厂里第一天使用电动织机时，雄心勃勃地说：“原来以为再做两年，这碗饭不是我吃的了；现在全厂电动化，再也不怕年纪大，还要和小伙子们赛一赛哩！”凯福糖果厂有九十多个手工包装的女工，人数虽然占全厂工人的60％，半制品还是经常积压，春节期间还由兄弟厂支援五十多人来突击。这次，女工们大破迷信，决心自力更生造出“长手的机器”来。最后果然制成了有两台机械手的散装包糖机和水果卷糖机、烫蜡机、打包机等包装机，生产效率提高四倍到二十倍。她们欢欣鼓舞，歌唱“劳动强度大降低，产量直线往上跳，省力又省时，质量呱呱叫，多年愿望已实现，全厂人人满脸笑。”
    这一时期上海的技术革新和技术革命运动，不仅改变了劳动面貌，提高了生产水平，也进一步解放了人们的思想，使运动一浪高一浪地更加广泛深入地向前发展。许多工厂企业的职工群众正以不断革命的精神总结革新成果，使机械化半机械化设备不断改善、不断提高。他们立下雄心大志，决心在年内做到凡是可以不用手工操作的生产部门全部实现机械化半机械化，以加速提高劳动生产率。与此同时，广大职工还大搞工艺改革、工具改革和设备改革，以及大胆采用新工艺、新技术。群众性的猛攻高级精密尖端产品、制造质量第一流的产品、大搞原材料节约和物资综合利用，也出现了更大的热潮。目前，全市技术革新和技术革命运动正在继续迅猛地向前发展。（附图片）
