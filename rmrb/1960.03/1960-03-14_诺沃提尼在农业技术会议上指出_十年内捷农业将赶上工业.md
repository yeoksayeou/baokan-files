Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 11th: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia convened a conference of scientific research and technical workers on the development of agricultural mechanization and agricultural technology from March 10th to 11th.

    The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Czech Communist Party, Novotný, spoke at the meeting. He said that the Czechoslovak people have put forward the task of making agriculture catch up with industry in ten years. Technology plays an important role in accomplishing this task. Technology should be widely used in agriculture.

    Novotný pointed out that agriculture should be provided with machines that are highly efficient and technologically advanced. These machines should be the most durable, the lowest in cost, and the most labor-saving.

    The Secretary of the Secretariat of the Czech Communist Party Central Committee, Černík, pointed out in his opening speech that the primary task of the machinery manufacturing industry is to ensure the comprehensive mechanization of agricultural production and the most modern technology. Industry, especially the machinery manufacturing industry, must also train technical cadres for agriculture.

    The Secretary of the Secretariat of the Czech Communist Party Central Committee, Krutina, emphasized at the closing of the meeting that during the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965), it is necessary not only to increase agricultural production but also to increase the labor productivity of agriculture by at least 50%. By 1965, the agricultural product production of each agricultural worker will increase to three to six times that of 1936.

    诺沃提尼在农业技术会议上指出
    十年内捷农业将赶上工业
    农业劳动生产率在第三个五年计划中提高50％
    新华社布拉格11日电　捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会10日至11日召开了关于发展农业机械化和农业技术的科学研究和技术工作者会议。
    捷共中央第一书记诺沃提尼在会上讲了话。他说，捷克斯洛伐克人民提出了在十年内使农业赶上工业的任务。为了完成这项任务，技术起着重要的作用。应该在农业中广泛运用技术。
    诺沃提尼指出，应该为农业提供具有高度效率、高度技术水平的机器。这种机器应该是最耐用、成本最低和最节省劳动力的。
    捷共中央书记处书记切尔尼克在开幕词中指出，当前，机器制造业的首要任务就是保证农业生产的综合机械化和具有最现代化的技术。工业，特别是机械制造业还要为农业培养技术干部。
    捷共中央书记处书记克鲁蒂纳在会议闭幕时强调说，在第三个五年计划过程中（1961—1965年），不仅要增加农业生产，还要把农业的劳动生产率至少提高50％。到1965年，每个农业工人的农产品生产将提高为1936年的三倍到六倍。
