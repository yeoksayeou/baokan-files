    Evidence of Sin
    Shortly after Columbus discovered the New World, Panama became an important route for imperialists to plunder the wealth of western America. It was much more convenient to pass through here to western America than to take other routes. American imperialists began building the first trans-American railway here in 1850. Many working people gave their lives in building this railway. According to local legends, the number of road construction workers who died was more than the number of sleepers used on the entire road. Among these victims were many of our compatriots, and one of the stations there is called "Dead Chinese."
    During the war between the United States and Spain for colonies in 1898, U.S. warships had to detour around Cape Horn in South America from the Pacific to the Atlantic, traveling 13,000 miles. Therefore, after building the railway, the United States spared no means to build the Panama Canal to shorten the route.
    The Panama Canal is now world-famous, and together with the railway built in 1850, it serves as evidence of the sins of colonialism. (Tāo Lóng)

    罪恶的证据
    巴拿马在哥仑布发现新大陆后不久就成为帝国主义掠夺美洲西部财富的要道，穿过这里到美洲西部去，比走其他的道路要方便得多。美帝国主义者于1850年便在这里开始建筑了第一条横贯美洲的铁路。修建这条铁路时许多劳动人民付出了生命。据当地传说，死亡的筑路工人比全路所用的枕木还要多。在这些牺牲者中还有许多是我国同胞，那里的一个车站便叫做“已死的中国人”。
    1898年美国和西班牙争夺殖民地的战争中，美国军舰从太平洋到大西洋不得不绕道南美的合恩角，走了一万三千英里路，因此继修铁路之后，美国又不惜任何手段修成了巴拿马运河以缩短航路。
    巴拿马运河现在举世闻名，而它正同1850年所修的那条铁路一起成为殖民主义者的罪恶的证据。　（滔龙）
