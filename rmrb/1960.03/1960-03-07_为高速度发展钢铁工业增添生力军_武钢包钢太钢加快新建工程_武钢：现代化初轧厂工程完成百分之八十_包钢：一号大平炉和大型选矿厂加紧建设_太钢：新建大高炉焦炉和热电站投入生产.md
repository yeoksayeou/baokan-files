    Wuhan Iron and Steel: Modern Primary Rolling Mill Project 80% Complete

    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 6th. In January and February of this year, the amount of construction and installation work completed by Wuhan Iron and Steel Company greatly exceeded that of any previous year during the same period. Each engineering company exceeded the state plan for two consecutive months, breaking the conventional pattern of "slack at the beginning and tight at the end." Throughout the Wuhan Iron and Steel construction site, a high tide is rolling, and good news is constantly pouring in.

    In order to seize continued leaps forward in 1960, Wuhan Iron and Steel construction workers are not only continuing to build refractory material plants, steelmaking plants, and power, transportation, water supply, and drainage projects, but also concentrating superior forces to accelerate the construction of various projects in the rolling steel system. The Wuhan Iron and Steel primary rolling mill, equipped with world-class equipment, has now completed more than 80% of its entire project. The large rolling mill of the primary rolling mill only started construction on February 1st, and in just over a month, rows of silver-gray reinforced concrete pillars have been erected, and workers have already begun hoisting metal structural components. The huge gas pipeline erected in the air extends from the steelmaking plant, surrounding the rolling area like a giant dragon. In the Daye mining area, more than one hundred kilometers away from the plant area, mine construction is also advancing at full speed. The new West Open-pit Mine at the foot of Daye Iron Mountain is expected to supply ore in the second half of the year.

    Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, March 6th. Under the slogan of "Produce steel early, produce more steel, and strive to produce steel products early to support national construction," Baotou Steel is accelerating the construction of steelmaking projects and material supply system projects such as iron ore mine coarse crushing and ore dressing plant medium and fine crushing.

    The No. 1 large open-hearth furnace is scheduled to produce steel in the second quarter of this year. At present, the No. 1 open-hearth furnace system project has entered the stage of cross-operations for metal structure installation, electromechanical installation, furnace construction, pipeline, and civil construction ending, and various projects are advancing simultaneously. The equipment installation project at the bottom of the open-hearth furnace and the furnace wall bricklaying project have been basically completed. The mixing iron furnace plant structure and some equipment such as the mixing iron furnace base have been basically installed. The bulk raw material workshop and the whole mold workshop are hoisting prestressed concrete trusses. The trestle bridge from the bulk raw material workshop to the main steelmaking plant has been mostly poured.

    The medium and fine crushing and other material supply system projects of the large-scale ore dressing plant under construction are currently in the stage of large-scale civil construction.

    The coarse crushing project under construction at the Baiyun Obo Iron Mine is also accelerating the installation of equipment. The railway from the workshop to the mine has been basically laid. After the coarse crushing system is completed, this large-scale modern iron ore mine will be fully completed.

    While constructing the steelmaking and raw material system projects, Baotou Steel is also stepping up preparations for the construction of the second large blast furnace. In order to cooperate with the early iron production of the No. 2 blast furnace, the construction project of the third large coke oven has also begun preparations.

    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, March 6th. The new large blast furnace, coke oven, and thermal power station of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company have recently been put into production.

    More than 10,000 employees of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company solemnly held a celebration meeting on February 28 to celebrate the commissioning of the three major projects. Xia Yun, Vice Minister of Metallurgical Industry, Chi Biqing, Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, and Ma Guishu, Secretary of the Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, attended the meeting to congratulate the employees.

    The three major projects of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company are designed by our country itself, and the equipment of the blast furnace and coke oven are also made in China. Their entire production process is automated and mechanized. The official commissioning of the three major projects marks a new stage in the production of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, a large-scale iron and steel joint enterprise. Its iron production this year will double compared to last year; the production of steel and steel products will increase by more than 60% compared to last year.

    These three major projects started construction in the third quarter of 1958. During the construction process, from the company's Party committee to every worker, the three major projects were regarded as the top priority, and the entire company concentrated its superior forces to ensure them. In the construction process, it also received support from more than 200 factories across the country.

    The successful completion of the three major projects is also the crystallization of the profound friendship between China and the Soviet Union and China and Germany. Soviet experts and experts from the German Democratic Republic contributed their strength to the three major projects with a lofty spirit of internationalism.

    新华社武汉6日电　今年1、2月份，武汉钢铁公司完成的建筑安装工作量，大大地超过以往任何一年的同期；各个工程公司连续两个月都超额完成国家计划，突破了历年来所谓“前松后紧”的常规。整个武钢建设工地，到处高潮滚滚，捷报频传。
    武钢建设职工为夺取1960年的继续跃进，今年以来一面继续建设耐火材料厂、炼钢厂以及动力、交通、供水排水等工程，一面集中优势力量加速轧钢系统各项工程的建设。拥有世界第一流设备的武钢初轧厂，全部工程目前已经完成80％以上。初轧厂的大型轧钢厂，2月1日才动工建设，仅一个多月时间，银灰色的钢筋混凝土柱子就已经成排地竖了起来，工人们已经着手吊装金属结构件。凌空架设的巨大煤气管道，从炼钢厂延伸过来，巨龙般地围绕着轧钢区。在远离厂区一百多公里的大冶矿区，矿山建设也在兼程前进。大冶铁山脚下新建的西露天采矿场，预计在下半年就可供矿。
    新华社包头6日电　包钢在“早出钢，多出钢，力争早出钢材，支援全国建设”的口号下，正在加紧建设炼钢工程和铁矿山粗破碎、选矿厂中细破碎等供料系统工程。
    一号大型平炉，要在今年二季度出钢。现在，一号平炉系统工程已经进入金属结构安装、机电安装、筑炉、管道和土建结尾等工程交叉作业阶段，各项工程正齐头并进。平炉下部的设备安装工程和炉墙砌砖工程已经基本完成，混铁炉厂房结构和混铁炉底座等部分设备，已经基本安装完毕，散装原料车间和整模车间正在吊装预应力混凝土桁架。从散装原料车间通往炼钢主厂房的栈桥，已经大部浇灌完毕。
    正在建设的大型选矿厂的中细破碎等供料系统工程，目前正处在土建工程大量施工阶段。
    在白云鄂博铁矿建设的粗破碎工程，目前也在加紧安装设备。由车间通往矿山的铁路，已经基本铺完。粗破碎系统建成后，这座大型现代化铁矿山就将全部建成。
    在建设炼钢、原料系统工程的同时，包钢第二座大型高炉的施工准备工作也正在加紧进行。为配合二号高炉提前出铁，第三座大型焦炉的建设工程，也已开始进行准备。
    新华社太原6日电　太原钢铁公司新建的大型高炉、焦炉和热电站最近全部投入生产。
    太原钢铁公司万余职工，在2月28日隆重举行三大工程投入生产的庆祝大会，冶金工业部副部长夏耘，中共山西省委书记处书记池必卿，中共太原市委书记处书记麻贵书，都到会向职工们祝贺。
    太原钢铁公司三大工程，是我国自行设计的，高炉和焦炉的设备也是国内制造的，它们的全部生产过程都是自动化和机械化的。三大工程的正式投入生产，标志着太原钢铁公司这座大型钢铁联合企业的生产进入了一个新的阶段，它的产铁量今年将比去年增长一倍；钢和钢材的产量将比去年增长60％以上。
    这三大工程是1958年第三季度开始施工。在建设过程中，从公司党委到每个工人，都把三大工程当作重点中的重点，全公司集中优势力量加以保证。在建设过程中，还得到全国二百多个工厂的支援。
    三大工程的胜利建成，也是中苏、中德深厚友谊的结晶。苏联专家、德意志民主共和国专家，以崇高的国际主义精神，为三大工程贡献了自己的力量。
