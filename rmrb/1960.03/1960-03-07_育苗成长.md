　　Nurturing Growth

　　On the eve of the 50th anniversary of International Working Women's Day, the reporter visited the Dafosi Street Kindergarten in the Dongcheng District of Beijing. This is an ordinary courtyard house, cleaned very neatly, giving people an exceptionally refreshing feeling. A group of innocent and lively children were doing various interesting activities under the guidance of their caregivers.

　　Peng Xiaohui, the director of the kindergarten, introduced the situation here to the reporter. In October 1952, when the motherland was in a period of large-scale socialist construction, many housewives actively responded to the Party's call and went out of their homes to participate in the construction cause. At the same time, many women were distressed because their children were unattended and they could not leave their homes. Peng Xiaohui was the director of the Women's Representative Council of Weijia Hutong in Dongsi District at that time. She understood that to solve this problem, a nursery had to be established. She kept pondering the matter of building a nursery. One day, she finally explained her plan to the residents, and at the same time, she repeatedly explained the benefits of establishing a nursery for production. This proposal immediately received enthusiastic support from the residents.

　　The work of establishing the nursery began. Where would the funds needed to build the station come from? Where to find houses, furniture, and childcare workers? This series of difficulties were all in front of them. At a discussion meeting on building the station, Peng Xiaohui raised these questions. The women shared these problems. Some raised funds, some voluntarily vacated their houses, and some residents lent their tables, benches, and furniture. Two housewives volunteered to come to the nursery as voluntary childcare workers.

　　The nursery was established in such a "poverty-stricken" situation. At that time, only seven children were admitted, and the childcare fees received were not enough to pay the rent. This did not shake their confidence in running the nursery well. The childcare workers took on all the burdens. Not only did they have to take good care of the children, but they also had to do a lot of cleaning work.

　　After several years of hard work, it has now developed from a small-scale nursery to a street kindergarten with three hundred children. At present, this kindergarten is a larger-scale and better-equipped street kindergarten in Beijing. In addition to the main kindergarten, there are two branch kindergartens. The childcare workers have always run the kindergarten in the spirit of diligence and thrift. They try their best to find ways to save money. They use candy wrappers to fold toys and broomsticks to make toy carts. Last year, in order to present a gift to the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, all the staff participated in the work of painting the houses, which saved one hundred yuan in expenses alone.

　　Director Peng Xiaohui finally told the reporter happily: "If our work can play a role in the cause of production and construction, that is our greatest glory." In the past seven years, the staff of the kindergarten has had a very clear understanding of serving production, and has made remarkable achievements in this regard. The kindergarten is always thinking about the children and the parents. Not long ago, they created a three-purpose chair for children to wash their hair, get haircuts, and take baths. Children can lie down to wash their hair and get haircuts. If the children's clothes, shoes, and socks are torn, the aunts immediately mend them, which reduces a lot of trouble for the mothers and enables them to work in production with peace of mind. Some parents find it difficult to pick up and drop off their children, so the aunts at the kindergarten take the place of the parents to pick them up and drop them off. Their sense of responsibility as masters of their own affairs and their high sense of responsibility have won high praise and praise from many parents.

    育苗成长
    在“三八”国际劳动妇女节五十周年的前夕，记者访问了北京市东城区大佛寺街道幼儿园。这是一个普通的四合院，院子打扫得干干净净，使人很有一种格外清新的感觉。一群天真活泼的孩子，正在保育员的辅导下作着各种有趣的活动。
    幼儿园园长彭筱惠妈妈向记者介绍了这里的情况。1952年10月，祖国正处在大规模的社会主义建设时期，很多家庭妇女积极响应党的号召，纷纷走出家门参加建设事业。同时，也有不少妇女因自己的孩子无人照管不能走出家门，感到很苦恼。彭筱惠是当时东四区魏家胡同妇女代表会的妇女主任，她了解要解决这个问题非建立托儿站不行。她不断地琢磨着筹建托儿站的事。有一天，她终于把自己的打算向居民说明了，同时，她又反复说明成立托儿站对生产的好处。这个提议立即得到了居民的热烈支持。
    建立托儿站的工作开始了。建站所需的经费从哪里来？房屋、家具和保育人员又去哪儿找？这一连串的困难都摆在她们面前。在一次建站的讨论会上，彭筱惠把这些问题提了出来。妇女们分担了这些难题。有的筹集基金，有的自动腾出房屋，还有的居民把自己的桌子、板凳和家具也借出来。两位家庭妇女自报奋勇地来托儿站当义务保育员。
    托儿站就是在这样一个“一穷二白”的情况下建立起来了。当时只收了七个孩子，所得到的保育费还不够交房租。这些并没有动摇她们办好托儿站的信心。保育员们把担子都担了起来。不仅要看管好孩子，就是许多清洁工作也要做。
    经过几年来的辛勤努力，现在已经由一个规模小的托儿站发展成为有三百个孩子的街道幼儿园了。目前，这个幼儿园是北京市规模较大，设备较为完善的街道幼儿园。除本园外，还有两个分园。保育员们一直本着勤俭办事业的精神办幼儿园。她们尽可能地想办法节约，她们利用包糖纸叠玩具，用扫帚把做小推车。去年，为了向建国十周年献礼，所有的工作人员都参加了粉刷房屋的工作，仅这一项就节约了一百元的开支。
    彭筱惠园长最后高兴地告诉记者说：“如果我们的工作能对生产建设事业起到一点作用，那是我们最大的光荣。”在这七年多的时间里，幼儿园的工作人员为生产服务的思想是十分明确的，在这方面做出了显著的成绩。幼儿园无时无刻不在为孩子着想为家长着想。不久前，她们创造了一个供孩子洗头、理发、洗澡的三用椅，孩子们能够躺着洗头和理发。孩子的衣服、鞋、袜破了，阿姨马上给缝补，这样就使妈妈们减少很多麻烦，能安心生产。有的家长对接送孩子感到困难，幼儿园的阿姨们就代替家长接送。她们这种主人翁的工作态度和高度责任感博得了不少家长的好评和赞扬。
