Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 3rd: Panmunjom Dispatch: The Korean Military Armistice Commission held a meeting today at the suggestion of the Korean and Chinese sides. Major General Zhu Changjun, the chief representative of the Korean and Chinese side, once again strongly condemned the U.S. side at the meeting for illegally transporting "Nike-Hercules" and "Hawk" missiles into South Korea, and demanded that the U.S. side immediately transport out of South Korea all kinds of missiles and new weapons that had been illegally transported in.

Major General Zhu Changjun said that U.S. military commander Magruder and South Korean Syngman Rhee, ignoring the dozens of protests from the Korean and Chinese sides and the condemnation from people all over the world, openly declared on February 22nd and 24th that various missiles were continuing to be shipped from the United States to South Korea. This serious violation of the armistice agreement by the U.S. side is not only direct threat to the Korean armistice, but also a new provocation to peace and security in the Far East.

Major General Zhu Changjun systematically exposed the U.S. side's conspiracy to expand its military and prepare for war in South Korea with a large number of facts. He pointed out that after the Chinese People's Volunteers withdrew from Korea, the U.S. side not only refused to withdraw all foreign troops from South Korea, but also planned to increase the number of U.S. military personnel in South Korea, attempted to reorganize the Rhee's puppet army into an atomic force, and openly clamored to deploy more new weapons in South Korea in accordance with the U.S. "strategic plan."

Major General Zhu Changjun also revealed that U.S. generals and the Syngman Rhee clique even clamored that they could attack designated targets in northern Korea within thirty minutes of receiving orders from the White House. As long as the White House issued an order, they would be prepared to advance to the Yalu River. Major General Zhu Changjun solemnly pointed out that all these facts clearly show that the United States is merely using "peace" as a smokescreen, and is single-mindedly stepping up preparations for a new war in South Korea, in order to choose an opportunity to undermine the armistice agreement and re-launch a war of aggression as it did on June 25, 1950.

The chief representative of the U.S. side, Maddocks, was speechless and unable to answer under the condemnation of the Korean and Chinese side. He stubbornly refused the demands of the Korean and Chinese side and even attempted to evade discussing the issue.

Finally, Major General Zhu Changjun said to the chief representative of the U.S. side that no matter how you quibble, you cannot justify your activities of preparing for a new war under the guise of so-called "peace" and "defense." For the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and for the sake of maintaining peace in the Far East and the world, you should immediately stop this dangerous game of playing with fire. Our side will continue to resolutely pursue your responsibility until you accept our demands in accordance with the obligations entrusted to you by the armistice agreement.

    美国加紧备战企图破坏朝鲜停火
    朝中代表谴责美国把导弹非法运入南朝鲜
    新华社平壤3日电　板门店消息：朝鲜军事停战委员会在朝中方面建议下今天举行会议。朝中方面首席委员朱昌骏少将在会上再一次强烈谴责美方把“奈克—赫尔克里士”式和“隼”式导弹非法运入南朝鲜，并且要求美方把非法运进南朝鲜的各种导弹和新式武器立即运出去。
    朱昌骏少将说，美军司令马格鲁德和南朝鲜李承晚不顾朝中方面的数十次抗议和全世界人民的谴责，公然在2月22日和24日宣称各种导弹正在继续由美国运往南朝鲜。美方的这种严重违反停战协定的行为不仅是对朝鲜停战的直接威胁，而且也是对远东和平和安全的新的挑衅。
    朱昌骏少将用大量事实系统地揭露了美方在南朝鲜扩军备战的阴谋活动。他指出，在中国人民志愿军从朝鲜撤出后，美方不仅拒绝从南朝鲜撤出一切外国军队，而且还计划增加在南朝鲜的美军人员，企图把李伪军改编为原子部队，并且公然叫嚣要根据美国“战略计划”在南朝鲜设置更多的新式武器。
    朱昌骏少将还揭露，美国将军和李承晚集团甚至叫嚣，他们在接到白宫命令后的三十分钟内就可以攻击朝鲜北部的指定目标。只要白宫发出命令，它们就准备推进到鸭绿江。朱昌骏少将严正指出，这一切事实清楚地表明，美国只不过是以“和平”作幌子，一味在南朝鲜加紧准备新的战争，以便选择时机，破坏停火规定，像在1950年6月25日那样重新发动侵略战争。
    美方首席委员马达克斯在朝中方面谴责下，理屈词穷，无言以对。他顽固地拒绝朝中方面的要求，甚至企图规避讨论这一问题。
    最后，朱昌骏少将向美方首席委员说，不管你方怎样诡辩，你都不能说明你方在所谓“和平”和“防御”等幌子下准备新战争的活动是正当的，为了朝鲜问题的和平解决，为了维护远东和世界的和平，你方应该立即停止这种危险的玩火勾当。我方将继续坚决追究你方的责任，直到你方按照停战协定赋于你方的义务接受我方要求时为止。
