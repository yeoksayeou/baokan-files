Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 8th: On the 7th, an airplane from the United States dropped incendiary bombs on the San Cristobal sugar mill in Pinar del Río Province, setting fire to 250,000 arrobas of sugarcane (one arroba equals 11.338 kilograms). Workers and militiamen extinguished the fire and quickly began crushing the sugarcane affected by the fire.

The General Secretary of the National Federation of Sugar Workers of Cuba, Beck, issued a statement today strongly protesting the aggressive activities carried out by airplanes from American bases against Cuba. Beck said that these planes were trying to sow the seeds of suffering in Cuba's sugarcane fields. But even if knives fall from the sky, Cuba's sugar production will continue, and the revolution will continue to advance.

    美国飞机继续轰炸古巴
    新华社哈瓦那8日电　7日有一架来自美国的飞机在比那尔德里奥省的圣克里斯托瓦尔糖厂投掷燃烧弹，中弹起火的甘蔗达二十五万阿罗瓦（一阿罗瓦等于十一点三三八公斤）。工人和民兵扑灭了大火，并且迅速着手压榨受到大火影响的甘蔗。
    古巴全国糖业工人联合会总书记贝克今天发表声明，强烈地抗议来自美国基地的飞机对古巴进行的侵略活动。贝克说，这些飞机企图在古巴的甘蔗田里播下苦难的种子。但即使是天上掉下刀子来，古巴的蔗生产还是要进行的，革命将继续前进。
