    The Pride of the Albanian People
    Alexander Moissi

    March 22nd of this year marks the 25th anniversary of the death of Alexander Moissi, a famous Albanian dramatic master. Alexander Moissi is the honor and glory of the Albanian people, and he enriched the tradition of world drama art with his talent and genius.

    Alexander Moissi was born on April 2, 1880, in Kavajë, a small city in Albania. From his childhood, he showed artistic talent, loved music, and had artistic inspiration for everything. However, due to the unbearable Turkish rule and the hardship of life, he wandered abroad for a long time.

    In Vienna, he embarked on the path of art. His outstanding artistic talent helped him overcome various difficulties, especially economic ones. However, these difficulties allowed him to better understand life, which greatly helped his later artistic career. He first entered the Austrian provincial theater, and a few years later, the Berlin theater, from which his name became world-renowned. He used his artistic genius to shape various roles in world literary masterpieces, such as Hamlet, Othello, Romeo, and characters from Goethe's and Tasso's works. He played various heroic figures, as well as roles in Molière's comedies. He breathed new life into countless characters in classical tragedies such as Aeschylus and Sophocles, as well as modern works by Ibsen, Chekhov, and Shaw. However, Moissi's true masterpiece was his portrayal of Hamlet.

    His name is praised by people all over the world. The brilliance of his art illuminated the art scenes of Vienna, Berlin, Moscow, Leningrad, Prague, London, Paris, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Bucharest, Milan, Rome, Florence, New York, and Istanbul. A contemporary audience member wrote: "From Moissi's eyes, we can read Shakespeare, Goethe, Ibsen, and Tolstoy." On stage, his clear lines were also warmly welcomed by the audience.

    Alexander Moissi had a profound humanitarian spirit. While engaged in his artistic career, he also worked hard for human progress. He quickly understood the significance of the October Revolution and used his artistic talent to fight against the old system. Moissi's revolutionary ideas terrified the fascists, who tried their best to persecute him. But his great genius had already taken root in the rich cultural treasury of mankind and in the future happiness of mankind.

    Although he spent almost his entire life far from his homeland, his heart always yearned for his motherland and was always linked to "the interests of the motherland." Especially shortly before his death, he returned to Albania again, but the anti-people Zog dynasty treated him like a jester in the court. He grieved for the suffering of his people in a place far from his homeland.

    Famous critics at the time talked about Moissi's artistic talent with great interest. For example, Stanislavski said in a letter to Moissi: "A great artist like you belongs to the whole world. Therefore, I regard you as a comrade and relative of our Moscow theater community. Travel to Europe, but don't stay there too long, come back to the Moscow Theater quickly. I hope to see you again and be with you forever."

    After liberation, the Albanian people cherish this great son of the people very much.

    Alexander Moissi's name will live forever. He demonstrated the vitality of the Albanian people with his genius. With his art, he contributed to human progress and to friendship between peoples. (Attached picture)

    阿尔巴尼亚人民的骄傲
    亚力山大·莫伊齐
    今年3月22日是阿尔巴尼亚著名的戏剧大师亚力山大·莫伊齐逝世的二十五周年。亚力山大·莫伊齐是阿尔巴尼亚人民的荣誉和光荣，他以自己的才能和天赋丰富了世界戏剧艺术的传统。
    亚力山大·莫伊齐于1880年4月2日生在阿尔巴尼亚的一个小城卡法亚。从他幼年时起，就显露出了艺术的天才，他爱好音乐，并且对每一件事物都有艺术的灵感。但由于不堪土耳其的统治和生活的困迫，他曾长期流浪在国外。
    在维也纳，他踏上了艺术的道路。他那杰出的艺术天才帮助他克服了种种困难，特别是经济上的困难。然而通过这些困难，使他更好地了解了生活，这对他以后的艺术生涯也有很大的帮助。他首先进了奥地利的省立剧院，几年后又进了柏林的剧院，他的名字也从此闻名世界。他以自己的艺术天才塑造了世界文学名著中的各种角色，例如哈姆雷特、奥赛罗、罗密欧以及哥德和塔索作品中的人物。他演过各种英雄人物，同时也演过莫里哀喜剧中的角色，他给了如埃斯基拉斯和索福克勒斯等古典悲剧以及易卜生、契呵夫和萧伯纳等人的现代作品中无数人物以新的生命。而莫伊齐的真正的杰作还是他扮演的哈姆雷特。
    他的名字为世界各国人民流颂着。他艺术的光辉照亮了维也纳、柏林、莫斯科、列宁格勒、布拉格、伦敦、巴黎、斯德哥尔摩、哥本哈根、布加勒斯特、米兰、罗马、佛罗伦萨、纽约和伊斯坦布尔等地的艺坛。当时的一位观众曾这样写道：“从莫伊齐的眼睛里，我们可以读到莎士比亚、哥德、易卜生和托尔斯泰的著作。”在舞台上，他那明朗的台词也受到了观众热烈的欢迎。
    亚力山大·莫伊齐具有深刻的人道主义精神。在从事艺术生涯的同时，他也为人类的进步而努力工作。他很快就理解了十月革命的意义，并以自己的艺术才能来为反对旧制度而斗争。莫伊齐的革命思想使法西斯分子感到恐慌，他们竭力地企图迫害他。但是他的伟大的天才已在人类丰富的文化宝库中，在人类未来的幸福中，扎下了根。
    他虽然几乎一生都是在远离祖国的地方度过的，然而他的心一直向往着祖国，一直和“祖国的利益”联在一起。特别在他逝世以前不久，他再次回到了阿尔巴尼亚，但反人民的索古王朝却把他当做宫廷中的小丑。他在远离祖国的地方为自己人民所受的苦难而悲痛。
    当时著名的评论家都怀着莫大的兴趣来谈论莫伊齐的艺术才能。例如，史坦尼斯拉夫斯基在他给莫伊齐的一封信中说：“像你这样伟大的艺术大师是属于全世界的。因此我把你当作我们莫斯科戏剧界的同志和亲人。你到欧洲去旅行吧，但是不要在那里停留得太久，快回到莫斯科剧院来。我希望再见你，并永远和你在一起。”
    解放后，阿尔巴尼亚人民十分珍视这位人民伟大的儿子。
    亚力山大·莫伊齐的名字永垂不朽。他以自己的天才表现了阿尔巴尼亚人民的生命力。他以自己的艺术，为人类的进步，为人民间的友谊，作出了贡献。（附图片）
