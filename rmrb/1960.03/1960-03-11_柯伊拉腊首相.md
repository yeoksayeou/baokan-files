Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Nepal and Minister of Defense and Foreign Affairs, Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala, was born in 1915. He graduated from Banaras Hindu University in India in 1934 and later studied law and economics at the University of Calcutta.

Koirala began participating in political activities as a student. He once practiced law in Darjeeling, India. Soon after, he abandoned his legal practice and devoted himself entirely to politics. In 1947, together with some Nepalese in India, he initiated the establishment of the Nepali National Congress in Calcutta. Shortly thereafter, he returned to Nepal and joined the struggle to overthrow the Rana autocratic regime then ruling Nepal, and was arrested and imprisoned twice.

In April 1950, Koirala merged the National Congress with a part of the then-Nepali Democratic Congress to form the Nepali Congress Party. From 1952, Koirala served as the chairman of the Congress Party for a long time.

In November 1950, the armed struggle to overthrow the Rana autocratic regime was launched, led by the Congress Party. Koirala was one of the leaders. As a result of this struggle, a joint government of the Congress Party and the Rana family was formed, with Koirala serving as the Minister of Home Affairs in the joint government.

In 1959, Nepal held its first parliamentary election, and the Congress Party won an absolute majority. On May 27 of the same year, the King of Nepal appointed Koirala as Prime Minister and formed a Congress Party cabinet. On June 30, the King officially approved Nepal's first constitution, and the Congress Party cabinet, with Koirala as Prime Minister, was sworn in on the same day. Prime Minister Koirala is also a famous writer in Nepal.
