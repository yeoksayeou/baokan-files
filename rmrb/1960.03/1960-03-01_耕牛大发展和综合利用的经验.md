Experiences in the Great Development and Comprehensive Utilization of Draft Cattle
CCP Guangfeng County Committee

Under the correct leadership of the Party, the draft cattle in Guangfeng County, Jiangxi Province, have achieved rapid development. Especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the "Five Completions" (full mating, full pregnancy, full birth, full survival, and full growth) of draft cattle have been achieved for two consecutive years. After communization, the comprehensive utilization of draft cattle has been widely promoted, so that cattle can not only cultivate fields, but also produce milk, transport goods, drive the processing of agricultural and sideline products, and so on.

Due to the achievement of the "Five Completions," more than 10,000 breeding cows in the county produced 9,554 calves in 1959, with a breeding rate of over 95%. The total number of draft cattle has reached 40,856, an increase of 30.48% compared to the end of 1958 and 3.57 times higher than in 1949. The county currently has 21,410 draft cattle with working ability, and the cultivated land area burdened by each draft cattle has decreased from 60 mu in the early days of liberation to 14 mu.

The reduction in the area of land burdened by draft cattle has relatively improved the intensity of intensive farming. In the past, due to the lack of draft cattle, usually only one plowing and one harrowing or two harrowings were done before transplanting rice seedlings; now, three plowing and three harrowings or four harrowings can be done, and deep plowing of six inches is common, and cultivation does not miss the farming season. With more cattle, there is also more fertilizer. Coupled with other production increase measures, the county's grain output has increased year by year. In 1958, the average grain yield per mu in the county was 900 jin, and in 1959, it jumped to 1,066 jin. In the past two years, more than 4 million jin and 10 million jin of surplus grain have been sold to the state, respectively, changing the historical shortage of grain.

Grasp Mating, Achieve "Five Completions"

Grasping mating and achieving the "Five Completions" is the key to the development of draft cattle; and grasping mating is the central link in achieving the "Five Completions."

In order to do a good job in mating, the county has successively established 247 draft cattle mating stations in various places, with an average of one station per brigade. This work is personally led by the branch secretary or brigade leader in charge of animal husbandry production. Taking the mating station as the center, the county has carried out mass mating work. In terms of methods, a combination of seasonal mating and year-round mating is adopted. Every year in April, May, June and August, September, and October, the county organizes large-scale shock mating campaigns, because this is the peak season for estrus in cows, and when the cows give birth to calves, it is also during the slack farming season, when green grass is abundant. This not only solves the contradiction between working and breeding, but also greatly improves the breeding rate and survival rate. In order not to miss the opportunity, the first secretaries of Party committees at all levels in the county personally organized the whole people to take action, stipulating that there should be an inspection every five days and a comparison every ten days. A combination of political and ideological education and material encouragement was also adopted, stipulating that for each successful mating, the cow and bull keepers would be given certain rewards to increase the keepers' enthusiasm for breeding draft cattle. In order to ensure that every cow is pregnant, all localities attach great importance to regular mating. The county includes mating work as one of the contents of the agricultural production inspection and comparison in various periods, and establishes a cow breeding registration book. For two consecutive years, the pregnancy rate of cows in the county has been above 95%. Among the 28 communes (farms), 21 communes (farms) have achieved full pregnancy.

On the basis of doing a good job in mating, the county also insists on doing a good job in protecting pregnancy, assisting in delivery, and nurturing young calves, so as to ensure full birth, full survival, and full growth after full mating and full pregnancy. All communes and teams stipulate that cows in the late stages of pregnancy should be fed more refined feed and appropriately reduced the amount of work they do, not pulling mills or making sharp turns, and stopping work for fifteen days before and after delivery to prevent miscarriage. When labor is imminent, designated keepers are responsible for cleaning the cowshed and replacing it with new straw. The placenta and contaminated bedding should be taken out immediately to avoid the cow accidentally eating them. In cold weather, a stove should be added to the cowshed during production, and the calves should be covered with old cotton or soft rice straw. When a calf is first born, clean scissors should be used to cut the umbilical cord and apply iodine for disinfection. The white tissue at the bottom of the hoof should be peeled off, and the hoof should be trimmed into a round shape, so that the hoof quality of the calf will be strong when it grows up. For cows with newborn calves, grazing on dangerous mountains and ditches is prohibited to prevent the calves from falling and getting injured. During busy farming seasons, when cows go to the fields, the calves should be fed enough milk and left in the pen to avoid the calves damaging crops and falling and getting injured, as well as affecting the cow's farming efficiency. Due to the good work in protecting pregnancy, assisting in delivery, and nurturing young calves, all the calves produced in the county in 1959 survived and were healthy.

Comprehensive Utilization, Value Doubled

The realization of the "Five Completions" of draft cattle has opened up broad avenues for carrying out the comprehensive utilization of draft cattle.

At the beginning of 1959, the county Party committee required all localities to actively use cattle to pull carts and process agricultural and sideline products to replace human labor, as well as vigorously develop the business of milking draft cattle, in addition to using draft cattle for cultivating fields and breeding. The county Party committee first conducted experiments in the Wudu People's Commune as a key point. At the beginning, some commune members said: "We raise draft cattle, not dairy cows, so we can't milk them"; some said: "If local cattle can be milked, then roosters can also lay eggs"; others said: "Even if they can be milked, it will affect the growth of calves." At this time, the county Party committee publicized the benefits of comprehensive utilization of draft cattle to the masses on the one hand, and insisted on experiments and educated the masses with facts on the other hand. After a month of experiments, it was proved that as long as attention is paid to feeding management, not only can milk be squeezed out, but also the health of the cow and the growth of the calf will not be affected. Some cadres who did not believe that draft cattle could be milked also became active. The commune also combined the large-scale construction of road networks and promoted cattle-drawn carts. Each cart can carry 2,000 to 4,000 jin, which is equivalent to the work efficiency of 20 to 40 laborers carrying loads on their shoulders. More and more agricultural and sideline product processing is also replacing human labor with animal power, setting an example for all communes in the county in the comprehensive utilization of draft cattle.

In April 1959, the county Party committee held a county-wide on-site meeting on the comprehensive utilization of draft cattle in the Wudu Commune. The commune's experience was quickly promoted throughout the county. So far, there are 1,150 cows in the county used for milking, of which 459 are milked regularly. 75 milking farms and 6 condensed milk factories have been built. The county has also built a semi-mechanized whole milk powder factory. The county widely uses cattle power to pull carts, drive agricultural and sideline product processing, and build water conservancy projects. In 1959, more than 2,800 draft cattle were used in this area, saving 1.59 million workdays, accounting for 7% of the total labor force in the county.

After the comprehensive utilization of draft cattle, they suddenly became worth a hundred times their value, greatly increasing the enthusiasm of cadres and the broad masses for raising cattle.

Select Good Breeding Cattle, Improve Breeds

Selecting and matching breeds is the fundamental key to developing draft cattle and improving the quality of draft cattle, especially selecting and retaining excellent breeding bulls is even more important. Because the quality of a cow only affects its own offspring, while the quality of a bull affects the offspring of 40 to 50 cows a year. Guangfeng County organized the selection and retention of 365 excellent breeding bulls throughout the county, with an average of one breeding bull for every 30 reproductive cows, eliminating inferior wild mating, and controlling the breeding or fattening and elimination of cows with particularly poor growth. The standards for selecting and retaining breeding bulls are: age 4 to 8 years old, strong and healthy, tall, docile, large and bright eyes, high shoulder peak, large chest circumference, strong and powerful limbs, round and large hooves, strong hoof quality, and developed and sound reproductive organs. After several years of selection and matching work, the quality of Guangfeng draft cattle has undergone tremendous changes. Of the 9,554 calves born in 1959, about 80% belonged to first-class cattle, and third-class cattle have almost disappeared.

Prepare Enough Grain and Grass, Strengthen Epidemic Prevention

The main ways Guangfeng County solves the problem of draft cattle feed are to grasp the three links of wild green grass, by-products of crops, and some refined feed. All communes have divided grazing areas to ensure sufficient green grass, seize the peak season for feed, and take measures such as silage and dry storage to harvest a large amount of green grass and reeds, and store rice straw, sweet potato vines, and bean pod husks. When early rice is harvested, in addition to returning some of the rice straw to the fields, all of it is used as feed; the rice straw from the second season of late rice is all collected and piled up, so that it is dried and stored in time, not wet or moldy, classified according to cattle, quantitatively determined by cattle, managed by special personnel, and used reasonably, ensuring that each yellow cattle has 3,000 to 4,000 jin of grass feed, and buffaloes have 4,000 to 5,000 jin. At the same time, a certain amount of small beans, rice bran, and table salt and other refined feed are also arranged to feed the cattle, and feed processing is actively promoted, such as alkalizing rice straw, to improve feed quality.

Our county has trained a large number of animal husbandry and veterinary talents through methods such as masters teaching apprentices, old teaching new, foreign teaching local, and running animal husbandry technical schools. Now, each commune and reclamation farm has established an animal husbandry and veterinary station, with two to three veterinary personnel; each brigade and animal husbandry farm has one to two epidemic prevention personnel. There are a total of 470 veterinarians and epidemic prevention personnel, and 16,000 keepers in the county, of which 602 multi-skilled keepers who have been trained and are both veterinary epidemic prevention personnel, keepers, and mating personnel, forming a county-wide epidemic prevention network, effectively controlling the occurrence of draft cattle diseases.

The main diseases of draft cattle in Guangfeng are rheumatism, indigestion, and scabies. In recent years, due to further improvement of feeding management, the sound establishment of an epidemic prevention network, and the adoption of a method of prevention first, treatment supplemented, local methods as the mainstay, and a combination of local and foreign methods, the mortality rate of draft cattle diseases has been reduced to 0.4%.

The "Five Completions" and comprehensive utilization of draft cattle can only be achieved on the basis of strengthening management, improving feeding, and improving quality. Guangfeng County has adopted five methods for this work: 1. Conscientiously select commune members who love the commune, love cattle, and have experience to be keepers; 2. Classify cattle according to their quality, conduct democratic evaluation, and reasonably stipulate remuneration; 3. Implement "three packages" and "six fixings." The "three packages" are: package feeding, package breeding, and package use; the "six fixings" are: fixing condition, fixing personnel, fixing feed, fixing work quota (fixing milk production), fixing fertilizer, and fixing wages. Achieve "six diligences" and "four cleanlinesses." The "six diligences" are: diligent grazing, diligent feeding in small amounts, diligent grooming, diligent bedding and manure removal, diligent watering, and diligent inspection; the "four cleanlinesses" are: clean feed, clean cattle body, clean cowshed, and clean utensils. 4. Regularly hold forums for keepers to exchange experiences; 5. Inspect once every half month, compare three to four times a year, and promptly carry out commendations and rewards. These measures have greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses for raising cattle.

Rational Use

After the comprehensive utilization of draft cattle, new tasks have been put forward for feeding management. This is how to arrange the use rationally to ensure the health of draft cattle and improve productivity. The methods adopted by Guangfeng County are: 1. Classify and arrange milking cows, cart-pulling cows, field-plowing cows, and pregnant cows, and rationally assign the amount of work. During busy farming seasons, field-plowing cows do not pull carts. Bulls and steers plow deep mud fields and pull heavy carts. Cows plow shallow mud fields and pull light carts or pull fewer carts. Cows in the late stages of pregnancy and milking cows appropriately reduce their workload, do not pull carts, go to work late, finish work early, walk slowly, rest more, and do not overwork; breeding bulls reduce or stop working during the mating period. 2. Cows that have just given birth to calves are not milked for a month, so that the calves can eat enough milk. In the second month, they are milked once every morning, leaving some milk for the calves to eat; after two months, the calves will be able to eat some feed, and they can be milked twice a day. 3. Milking cows and calves should be fed more refined feed, supplied with a certain amount of fine rice bran, black beans (ground into soybean milk), and table salt, which are mixed and fed in the morning and evening to ensure that the cows and calves are healthy.

    耕牛大发展和综合利用的经验
    中共广丰县委会
    在党的正确领导下，江西广丰县的耕牛获得了迅速发展。特别是1958年大跃进以来，连续两年实现了耕牛“五全”（全配、全准、全生、全活、全壮）；公社化后，又广泛推行了耕牛的综合利用，使牛既能耕田，又能产奶、运输和带动农副产品加工等等。
    由于实现了“五全”，全县一万多头有繁殖能力的母牛，1959年共产小牛九千五百五十四头，繁殖率达95％以上。耕牛总头数已达四万零八百五十六头，比1958年底增加30．48％，比1949年增加三点五七倍。全县现有使役能力的耕牛二万一千四百一十头，每头耕牛负担的耕地面积已由刚解放时的六十亩减少到十四亩。
    耕牛负担土地面积减少，相对地提高了农田的精耕细作程度。往年，由于耕牛少，通常只能做到一犁一耙或二耙就插秧；现在，可以做到三犁三耙或四耙，并普遍深耕六寸，耕作不误农时。牛多肥也多，加上其他增产措施，我县粮食产量年年增加，1958年全县粮食平均亩产九百斤，1959年跃为一千零六十六斤。近两年，卖给国家的余粮分别达四百多万斤和一千万斤，改变了历史上的缺粮面貌。
    抓紧配种　实现“五全”
    抓紧配种，实现“五全”，是耕牛发展的关键；而抓紧配种，又是实现“五全”的中心环节。
    为了做好配种工作，我县先后在各地建立了二百四十七个耕牛配种站，平均每个大队有一个，这项工作由大队管畜牧业生产的支部书记或大队长亲自领导。以配种站为中心，全县开展了群众性的配种工作，在方法上采取狠抓季节性的配种和常年性的配种相结合。在每年4、5、6月和8、9、10月，全县即组织大规模的突击配种运动，因为这个时候正值母牛发情旺季，待母牛产仔时又正遇农闲，青草繁茂，这样既解决了使役和繁殖的矛盾，又能大大提高繁殖率和成活率。为了不错过良机，全县各级党委第一书记都亲自组织全民行动，规定五天一检查，十天一评比，还采取政治思想教育和物质鼓励相结合的办法，规定每配准一头牛，母牛和公牛的饲养员都给予一定报酬，以提高饲养员对繁殖耕牛的积极性。为保证头头母牛满怀，各地非常重视经常性的配种，全县把配种工作列入各个时期农业生产检查评比的内容之一，并建立了母牛繁殖登记簿。全县连续两年母牛怀胎率都在95％以上，二十八个社（场）中，就有二十一个社（场）达到满怀。
    在抓好配种工作的基础上，全县又坚持做好保胎、接产、幼育等工作，以保证全配、全准之后，实现全生、全活、全壮。各个社、队都规定了怀孕后期的母牛加喂精料，适当减轻使役，不拉磨，不转急弯，产前产后十五天停止使役，以防止流产。临产时指定饲养员专责打扫牛舍，换垫新藁。产后的包衣和污染垫草，应即时取出，避免母牛误食。严寒天气生产时，牛栏要加火炉，给小牛盖上旧棉絮或柔软稻草。小牛初生，要用清洁剪刀剪断脐带，涂上碘酒消毒。并将蹄底白色组织剥去，把蹄修成圆形，这样，小牛长大后蹄质坚实。对初生小牛的母牛，规定不在险山、沟边放牧，防止小牛跌伤。农忙母牛下田，要让小牛吃饱奶留在栏里，避免小牛损坏庄稼和跌伤，以及影响母牛耕作效率。由于做好了保胎、接产、幼育等工作，全县1959年生产的小牛，做到全部成活，头头健壮。
    综合利用　身价百倍
    耕牛“五全”的实现，为开展耕牛综合利用打开了广阔的道路。
    1959年初，县委要求各地除了把耕牛用于耕田、繁殖之外，应该积极地利用牛力拉车和进行农副产品加工来代替人力，以及大力展开耕牛挤奶的业务。县委首先以五都人民公社为重点进行试验，开始时有些社员说：“我们养的不是奶牛，不能挤奶”；有的说：“土牛能挤奶，公鸡也能生蛋”；还有的说：“即使能挤奶，也会影响小牛生长”。这个时候，县委一面向群众宣传耕牛综合利用的好处；一方面坚持试验，用事实教育群众。经过一个月的试验证明，只要注意饲养管理，不仅能挤出奶，而且不影响母牛的健康和小牛成长。一些不相信耕牛能挤奶的干部也积极起来了。这个公社还结合大修道路网，推广了牛拉车，每部车可载重二千到四千斤，等于二十到四十个劳力肩挑工效。农副产品加工也越来越多地以畜力来代替人力，为全县各公社树立了耕牛综合利用的榜样。
    1959年4月，县委在五都公社举行了全县耕牛综合利用现场会议。这个公社的经验迅速在全县推广。到目前为止，全县用于挤奶的母牛有一千一百五十头，其中经常挤奶的有四百五十九头，建成挤奶场七十五座，炼奶厂六座，县里还建成一座半机械化生产的全脂奶粉厂。全县广泛利用牛力拉车，带动农副产品加工以及兴修水利。1959年全县用到这方面的耕牛达二千八百多头，节省了劳动日一百五十九万个，占全县总劳动力7％。
    耕牛综合利用后，一时变得身价百倍，大大地提高了干部和广大群众养牛的积极性。
    选好种牛　改良品种
    选种选配，是发展耕牛提高耕牛质量的根本关键，特别是选留优良种公牛更重要。因为母牛的好坏只影响本身的下代，而一头公牛的好坏，一年就要影响四十至五十头母牛的下代。广丰县组织全县选留了优良种公牛三百六十五头，平均每三十头能生殖的母牛就有一头种公牛，杜绝了劣种野配，并对生长特别差的母牛控制繁殖或育肥淘汰。选留种公牛的标准是：年龄四至八岁，身强体壮，体型高大，性情温驯，眼大有神，肩峰高，胸围大，四肢强壮有力，蹄形圆大，蹄质坚实，生殖器发达健全。经过几年来的选种选配工作，广丰耕牛质量发生了巨大变化。1959年生下小牛九千五百五十四头中，有80％左右属于一类牛，三类牛几乎绝迹。
    备足粮草  加强防疫
    广丰县解决耕牛饲料的办法，主要是抓住野生青草、农作物的副产品和一部分精料等三个环节。各公社都划分了放牧区域，保证有足够的青草，大抓饲料旺季，采取青贮、干藏等办法，大量割青草、芦苇，贮藏稻草、红薯藤、豆荚壳等。在早稻收割时，稻草除以一部分还田外，都作为饲料；二季晚稻的稻草全部收藏上堆，做到及时晒藏，不湿不霉，按牛分等，以牛定量，专人管理，合理使用，保证每头黄牛有草料三千至四千斤，水牛有四千至五千斤。同时，还安排了一定的小豆、米糠和食盐等精料喂牛，并积极推行饲料加工，如碱化稻草等，以提高饲料质量。
    我县通过以师带徒，以老带新，以洋带土以及举办畜牧技术学校等办法，培养了大批的畜牧兽医人材。现在，每个公社和垦殖场都建立了畜牧兽医所，有二至三名兽医人员；大队和畜牧场都有一至二名防疫员。全县共有兽医和防疫人员四百七十人，饲养员一万六千名，其中经过训练后，既是兽疫防治员，又是饲养员和配种员的多能饲养员六百零二名，形成了全县范围的防疫网，有力地控制了耕牛疫病的发生。
    广丰耕牛的主要疫病是风湿病、积食病和疥癣三种。最近几年，由于进一步改善了饲养管理，健全和建立了防疫网，采取了以防为主，以治为辅，以土为主，土洋结合的办法，耕牛的疫病死亡率已降低到0．4％。
    耕牛的“五全”和综合利用，只有在加强管理、改善饲养和提高质量的基础上才能实现。广丰县对这方面工作采取了五条办法：1、认真选择爱社、爱牛而又有经验的社员作饲养员；2、按牛分等，民主评议，合理规定报酬；3、实行“三包”和“六定”，“三包”即包饲养、包繁殖、包使用；“六定”即：定膘头、定人员、定饲料、定额使役（定产奶量）、定肥料、定工资。做到“六勤”和“四净”，“六勤”是：勤放牧、勤添少喂、勤梳刷、勤垫栏出粪、勤饮水、勤检查；“四净”是：饲料净、牛身净、牛舍净、用具净。4、定期召开饲养员座谈会，交流经验；5、每半月检查一次，每年评比三至四次，及时进行表扬奖励。通过这些措施大大地鼓舞了群众养牛的积极性。
    合理使役
    耕牛实行综合利用后，又给饲养管理提出了新的任务。这就是如何做到合理安排使用，以保证耕牛的健康和生产力的提高。广丰县采取的办法是：1、把挤奶牛、拉车牛、耕田牛和孕牛进行分类排队，合理使役负担，农忙时耕田不拉车，公牛、阉牛耕深泥田、拉重车，母牛耕浅泥田、拉轻车或少拉车，怀孕后期的母牛和挤奶牛，适当减轻使役负担，不拉车，晚出工，早收工，慢走，多歇，不过劳；种公牛配种期间减轻使役或停止使役。2、母牛初生小牛一个月不挤奶，让小牛吃足奶水，在第二个月，每天早晨挤一次，留些奶水给小牛吃；满两个月以后，小牛已会吃些饲料，每天可挤两次。3、对挤奶母牛和小牛要加喂精料，供给一定数量的细米糠、黑豆（磨豆浆）和食盐，每天早晚拌和喂食，保证母牛小牛身体健壮。
