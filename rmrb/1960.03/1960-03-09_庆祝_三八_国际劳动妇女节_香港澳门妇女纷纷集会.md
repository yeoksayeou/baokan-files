    Celebrating "March 8th" International Working Women's Day
    Women in Hong Kong and Macau Gather to Celebrate
    Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 8th – Women from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Macau have been holding various gatherings in recent days to celebrate "March 8th" International Working Women's Day.
    The Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions and female workers from various industries have held tea parties, recreational gatherings, and film screenings in recent days to celebrate "March 8th." At the tea parties, female workers spoke about the hardship of working in Hong Kong, the difficulties in life, the lack of care and education for their children, and demanded reasonable working hours and wages, improved working conditions, and increased worker welfare.
    Women's groups such as the Women's Department of the Hong Kong Chinese Reform Association, Hong Kong and Kowloon Industrial and Commercial Women, the Hong Kong Chinese Clerical Association, the Women's Department of the Fujian Native Association in Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong Western District Women's Welfare Association have all held celebratory gatherings.
    In Macau, organizations such as the Women's Federation, the Chinese Education Association, the Chinese Students' Union, and the Youth Association held celebrations on the 7th.
    Hong Kong's "Wen Wei Po" and "Ta Kung Pao" both published editorials today celebrating "March 8th" International Working Women's Day. Both editorials compared the humiliating status and tragic experiences of women in the Western world with the genuine freedom and equality enjoyed by women in socialist countries, pointing out that the slogan of "gender equality" can only be truly realized where socialism has triumphed.

    庆祝“三八”国际劳动妇女节
    香港澳门妇女纷纷集会
    新华社香港8日电　香港和澳门各界妇女连日来纷纷举行各种集会，庆祝“三八”国际劳动妇女节。
    港九工会联合会和各业女工为庆祝“三八”节，连日分别举行了茶叙会、游艺大会和电影欣赏会。在茶叙会上，女工们都诉说了香港女工工作辛劳，生活困苦，子女得不到照料和受教育，要求得到合理工时、工资、改善劳动条件，增加工人福利。
    香港华人革新协会妇女部、港九工商界妇女、香港华人文员协会、福建旅港同乡会妇女部、香港西区妇女福利会等妇女团体都举行了庆祝集会。
    在澳门，妇女联合会、中华教育会、中华学生联合总会和青年联谊会等团体，在7日分别举行了庆祝活动。
    香港“文汇报”、“大公报”今天都发表了庆祝“三八”国际劳动妇女节的社论。两报社论都用西方世界妇女的屈辱地位和悲惨遭遇，同社会主义国家妇女真正得到自由平等的情况作了对比，指出“男女平等”这个口号只有在社会主义取得胜利的地方才能真正实现。
