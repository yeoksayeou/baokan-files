Xinhua News Agency, March 2nd: Our reporter Gong Ce reports: In the Great Leap Forward, a huge change has occurred in the basic life of Chinese cities - tens of millions of housewives have shaken off the tedious household chores that dull the mind and have participated in social labor, founding all kinds of tens of thousands of street factories and service institutions.

　　Urban housewives participating in street production and service undertakings are entirely a product of the Great Leap Forward era of high-speed socialist construction. Starting in 1958, inspired by the Party's general line for socialist construction and driven by the needs of large-scale industrial production and the Great Leap Forward situation, many urban housewives founded extremely simple so-called "people-run street factories" that were almost entirely operated by hand. These emerging sprouts received strong support from the Party and the government from the very beginning. By 1959, they had achieved comprehensive development, rectification, and improvement in thousands of large, medium, and small cities. The participation of housewives surged, and according to statistics from 43 large and medium-sized cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, and Jinan at the end of 1959, more than 44,000 people-run industrial units had been established, with more than 1.4 million workers, the vast majority of whom were women. In Beijing's more than 4,000 street-run industrial units, female workers accounted for 95%; Tianjin accounted for 90%; Shenyang accounted for 84%; and Kunming basically became a "city with no idle people" last autumn.

　　In these 43 cities, the output value of people-run industries reached more than 2.7 billion yuan last year, and the cities all experienced multiple increases, especially in the second half of the year. In Shenyang, the total output value of people-run industries in 1959 was equivalent to eight times the total output value of the city's local industries ten years ago. Due to participating in social labor, women's household incomes have generally increased, with Shenyang's average income increasing by 20% to 35%. Their lives have improved, and some households that previously required government relief have now become savings households. All of this shows that a new and huge productive force is rising in Chinese cities.

　　The people-run industries of a socialist collective ownership nature are a powerful assistant to large-scale industry. Some people-run industries in various places process for large-scale industries or produce various small parts; others manufacture various daily necessities needed by the people, widely utilizing idle manpower, materials, and financial resources, turning consumption into production, and turning the useless into the useful. Shijiazhuang's people-run factories directly process and produce more than 430 kinds of products for large-scale industries, effectively becoming the "auxiliary workshops" and "satellite factories" of state-owned factories, enabling large factories to concentrate their efforts on key production. This mutually beneficial relationship between street industries and state-owned industries has gradually incorporated street industries into the national plan, while also solving the raw material and sales problems of street industries. Through the training of street factories, women have learned skills and improved their techniques, which has provided a large number of new labor reserves for large-scale industry. Last year, Shijiazhuang's street factories transferred more than 5,000 workers to large-scale industry.

　　Due to the great development of people-run street industries, women urgently demanded the organization of collective living welfare undertakings and social service undertakings, and a large number of nurseries, public canteens, resident life service stations, repair shops, and other organizations were established. These organizations were created out of the needs of the Great Leap Forward in production, liberated labor, and promoted the Great Leap Forward in production. At the same time, they are rapidly realizing the socialization of housework, enhancing women's socialist and communist consciousness, and further establishing new relationships between people. Therefore, the emergence of these undertakings has received enthusiastic support from the broad masses and has achieved rapid and vigorous development. According to preliminary statistics from ten provinces and regions, including Sichuan, Hebei, Shandong, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan, there are more than 36,000 people-run street nursery organizations in cities, caring for 1.4 million children; there are more than 40,000 street service stations in cities, with more than 250,000 service personnel; and there are more than 20,000 resident canteens in cities, with more than 4 million people eating there. Through these organizations, the items for serving residents' lives are almost all-encompassing and very extensive, and the service personnel are affectionately called the "housekeepers" of mass life with a communist style by the residents. All these undertakings have been warmly welcomed by the residents. When the residents of Danan Street in Guangzhou started a canteen, only fifteen people dined there, but later the number of people dining at this canteen increased to more than 600. There are now 389 street public canteens in the city, with nearly 100,000 people regularly dining in the canteens. Some canteens have five to ten or more dishes for each meal. Residents find this convenient, their lives are improved, and they are full of praise. Due to the widespread development of collective living welfare undertakings and social service undertakings in cities, the contradiction between collective production and individual consumption has been resolved. For the first time in history, such a large number of women have been liberated from trivial housework, which obviously has immeasurable significance for the complete liberation of women.

　　After housewives were organized in production and life, it was greatly conducive to carrying out socialist and communist education, and their ideological awareness was rapidly improved. At the same time, due to a large amount of exposure to new things, their minds were broadened and their horizons were greatly expanded. Some women said, "In the past, I was always revolving around the stove, and my eyes could not see far. Now I am concerned about national affairs." Almost all women participating in street production actively participate in political and cultural studies in factories and streets. Last year, more than 8,000 street residents in Xicheng District, Beijing, participated in preparatory classes for junior high school, and more than 800 people studied junior high school courses. Many women actively participated in various political activities. Last year, more than 1,000 advanced producers emerged in the street factories of Shenyang, more than 800 people joined the Communist Party, and more than 500 people joined the Communist Youth League.

　　Women have learned production skills, work like men, increased their income, and shared a part of the household expenses, so their status in the family has also increased. At the same time, due to the improvement of women's awareness and the broadening of their minds, a new atmosphere of family harmony and neighborhood unity has generally been brought about, and great changes have taken place in the relationship between people. In the past, the residents of Chunshu Hutong in Beijing had more than 100 courtyards that "fought endlessly," some even arguing for ten or eight years. Now everyone works together, studies together, and makes progress together. The phenomenon of quarrels and fights has disappeared, and the "quarrel courtyards" have become lively "unity courtyards." These changes in women's spiritual life are by no means accidental. They enthusiastically praised: "This is a great undertaking that enriches the country and benefits the people," "It is the Party and Chairman Mao who have guided us women into a new era."

    大批城市妇女大办街道工厂和服务事业
    摆脱家务琐事　参加社会劳动
    她们不仅在生产上作出贡献，共产主义觉悟也大大提高
    据新华社2日讯　本社记者宫策报道：在大跃进中，中国城市基层生活中出现了一个巨大的变化——成千百万的家庭主妇摆脱了令人愚昧的家务琐事，参加了社会劳动，她们创办了形形色色的成千成万个街道工厂和服务性事业机构。
    城市家庭妇女参加街道生产和服务事业，完全是高速度建设社会主义的大跃进时代的产物。从1958年开始，在党的社会主义建设总路线鼓舞下，由于大工业生产的需要和大跃进形势的推动，许多城市的家庭妇女创办了几乎完全是手工操作的极为简陋的所谓“街道民办工厂”。这些新生事物的萌芽，一开始就得到了党和政府的大力支持。到1959年，在成千个大中小城市中，得到了全面的发展、整顿和提高。参加的家庭妇女们风起云涌，根据北京、天津、沈阳、济南等四十三个大中城市1959年年底统计，共创办了四万四千多个民办工业单位，有一百四十多万劳动者，其中绝大多数都是妇女。北京四千多个街道民办工业单位中，女职工占95％；天津占90％；沈阳占84％；昆明市在去年秋天就基本上变成了一个“无闲人城”。
    在这四十三个城市中，去年民办工业的产值达到二十七亿多元，特别是下半年各城市都有成倍的增长。在沈阳市，1959年的民办工业总产值，相当于十年前这个城市地方工业总产值的八倍。由于参加社会的劳动，妇女们家庭的收入普遍增加，沈阳市平均增加收入20％到35％，她们的生活改善了，一些过去需要政府救济的户，现在变成了储蓄户。这一切都表明新中国的城市中，正崛起一支新兴的巨大的生产力量。
    社会主义集体所有制性质的民办工业，是大工业的有力助手。各地民办工业有的为大工业加工，或者生产各种细小的配件；有的制造人民生活所需要的各式各样的日用品，它广泛地利用闲散的人力物力和财力，变消费为生产，变无用为有用。石家庄市民办工厂直接为大工业加工生产的产品达四百三十多种，实际上成了国营工厂的“辅助车间”和“卫星工厂”，使大工厂能够集中力量搞好主要生产。街道工业和国营工业这种相依为用的作用，也就把街道工业逐步纳入了国家的计划，同时解决了街道工业的原料和销路问题。通过街道工厂的锻炼，妇女们学会了本领，提高了技术，这就为大工业提供了一大批新的劳动后备力量。石家庄市的街道工厂在去年就为大工业输送了五千多名工人。
    由于街道民办工业的大发展，妇女们迫切地要求组织集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业，大批的托儿所、公共食堂、居民生活服务站、修理点等组织成立起来。这些组织是在生产大跃进的需要下产生的，又解放了劳动力，促进了生产大跃进。同时又是迅速地实现着家务劳动社会化，提高妇女社会主义、共产主义觉悟，更进一步建立了人与人的新型关系。因此这些事业的出现，得到了广大群众的热烈拥护，得到了迅速的蓬勃的发展，据四川、河北、山东、辽宁、黑龙江、湖北、湖南、广西、贵州、云南等十个省区的初步统计，城市街道民办托儿组织共有三万六千多个，收托儿童一百四十万人；城市街道服务站有四万多个，服务人员二十五万多人；城市居民食堂有二万多个，入伙人数四百多万人。通过这些组织，为居民生活服务的项目几乎无所不包，非常广泛，服务人员们被居民亲切地称呼为具有共产主义风格的群众生活的“管家人”。所有这一切事业，得到了居民们热烈的欢迎。广州市大南街居民开始办食堂时只有十五人搭伙，后来到这个食堂搭伙的人增加到六百多。全市现在已有三百八十九个街道公共食堂，有将近十万人经常在食堂搭伙，有的食堂每餐都有五种到十多种菜，居民们对此既感到方便，生活又得到改善，无不满口称赞。由于城市中集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业的普遍发展，这就使集体生产和个体消费间的矛盾解决了，历史上第一次有这样大量的妇女从琐碎家务中解放出来，它对于彻底解放妇女显然有着无可估量的意义。
    家庭妇女们从生产上和生活上组织起来以后，大大有利于开展社会主义和共产主义教育，思想觉悟迅速得到提高。同时还由于大量地接触新事物，她们心胸开阔，眼界大开。有的妇女说，“过去整天围着锅台转，眼睛看不远，现在关心国家大事了”。几乎所有参加街道生产的妇女，都积极地参加厂里和街道上的政治和文化学习。北京市西城区街道居民去年有八千多人参加了高小预备班，有八百多人读初中课程，许多妇女积极参加各种政治活动。沈阳市的街道工厂里，去年涌现出一千多名先进生产者，有八百多人加入了共产党，五百多人加入共青团。
    妇女们学会了生产的本领，和男子一样劳动，增加了收入，分担一部分家庭开支，这样她们在家庭中的地位也随之提高了。同时还由于妇女们觉悟提高，心胸开阔，普遍带来家庭和睦、邻里团结的新气象，人和人的关系发生了极大的变化。北京市椿树胡同的居民，以前有一百多个打“罗圈架”的大院，有的甚至十年八年争吵不休，现在大家一起劳动，一起学习，共同进步，争吵打架的现象消除了，“争吵院”变成了生气勃勃的“团结院”。妇女们精神生活的这些变化，都绝不是偶然的。她们热烈地赞扬说：“这是富国富民的大事业”，“是党和毛主席引导我们妇女跨进了新时代”。
