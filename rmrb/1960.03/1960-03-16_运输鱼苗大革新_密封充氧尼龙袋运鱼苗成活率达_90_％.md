    Major Innovation in Fish Fry Transportation
    Sealed, Oxygen-Filled Nylon Bags Achieve 90% Survival Rate for Fish Fry
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) The aquatic products department has successfully experimented with using nylon bags filled with oxygen and sealed for transporting fish fry, achieving a significant innovation in fish fry transportation.
    Every year, China transports approximately eight billion fish fry from riverside provinces such as Hubei, Jiangxi, and Anhui to various parts of the country. In the past, bamboo baskets, water buckets, and canvas buckets were generally used, requiring a large number of transportation vehicles. Because these were greatly affected by external temperatures, the survival rate was relatively low. Using nylon bags to transport fish fry generally results in a survival rate of over 90%, an increase of 30% to 40% compared to using bamboo baskets. Using nylon bags, a single railway car can transport 50 million to 70 million fish fry, an increase in carrying capacity of about 13 times compared to using bamboo baskets. Using nylon bags, fish fry can also be transported in boxes, eliminating the need for escort personnel to take care of them. (Image attached)

    运输鱼苗大革新
    密封充氧尼龙袋运鱼苗成活率达90％
    据新华社讯　水产部门试验用尼龙袋充氧气密封运输鱼苗成功，实现了鱼苗运输的重大革新。
    我国每年从湖北、江西、安徽等省沿江地区运往国内各地的鱼苗有八十亿尾左右，过去一般用竹篓、水桶、帆布桶装运，需要大量交通运输工具，因为受外界气温影响大，成活率也较低。用尼龙袋装运鱼苗，一般成活率都在百分之九十以上，比用竹篓等装运成活率提高百分之三十到百分之四十。用尼龙袋装运鱼苗，一个车皮可装运五千万到七千万尾，装运量比用竹篓等提高十三倍左右。用尼龙袋运鱼苗，还可装箱托运，不再要押运人员照料。（附图片）
