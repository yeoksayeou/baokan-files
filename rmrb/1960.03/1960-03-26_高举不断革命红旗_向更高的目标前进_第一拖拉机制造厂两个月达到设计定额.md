Hold High the Red Banner of Continuous Revolution and Advance Towards Higher Goals

The First Tractor Factory Reaches Designed Production Quota in Two Months

    (Our dispatch) Guided by Chairman Mao's thought of continuous revolution, the Luoyang First Tractor Factory has launched a vigorous campaign of technical innovation and revolution, closely centered on its production tasks.

    From November of last year to February of this year, in just three months, the entire factory proposed over 63,000 innovation suggestions, of which more than 21,700 have been implemented. Among these, 356 items are inventions with significant value for promotion (including cutting-edge technologies), 5,227 involve improved processes, and 200 involve improved designs. The entire factory has also established 33 automatic production lines and automatic units, with over 50% of the machine tools achieving single-machine automation and semi-automation. In addition, over 1,100 manual operations have been mechanized. Due to the implementation of technical innovation and revolution, this modern large enterprise, which has been formally in production for less than five months, has not only overfulfilled its production plans ahead of schedule every month, but also basically reached its original designed production quota for the year in just over two months. Currently, the production capacity of 40% of the parts has reached a level of doubling.

    The characteristics of the First Tractor Factory's technical innovation and revolution movement are deep and thorough mass mobilization, clear direction, and concrete measures. Among the innovation projects they have implemented, there are not only high-tech, cutting-edge items, but also many inexpensive solutions that have solved major problems. For example, the vibrating rotary feeding mechanism for grinding machines only required the addition of simple attachments and mechanisms to achieve semi-automation of centerless grinding. These projects were achieved through the collective wisdom and efforts of many workers under the guidance of a clear direction. Secondly, the principle of "combining indigenous and foreign methods" was implemented, and many key problems were solved through self-reliance. Initially, when many people mentioned automation, they only thought of sophisticated equipment and instruments such as electrical components and program control. Later, the workers developed the spirit of daring to think and act, and added simple cam devices, pneumatic fixtures, and even utilized simple lever principles and the machine tool's own mechanical movements, as well as vibration, centrifugal force, hydraulic power, and other indigenous methods and equipment on many lathes, thereby achieving automation and semi-automation. For example, the stamping workshop automated the feeding and discharging of all presses in three days and nights by utilizing the up and down movement of the presses through different mechanical devices. This simple and easy-to-implement innovation completely shattered the conservative thinking of some people who previously believed that automation could only be achieved through electrification.

    Currently, the vigorous mass movement of technical innovation and revolution is being carried out in depth at this factory. Their slogan is: "We must make modern large enterprises exert even greater power."

### 高举不断革命红旗　向更高的目标前进  第一拖拉机制造厂两个月达到设计定额

    高举不断革命红旗　向更高的目标前进
    第一拖拉机制造厂两个月达到设计定额
    本报讯　洛阳第一拖拉机制造厂在毛主席不断革命的思想指导下，紧密围绕生产任务，掀起了技术革新和技术革命热潮。
    从去年11月到今年2月，仅三个月的时间，全厂就提出了革新建议六万三千多项，已经实现的有二万一千七百多项。其中属于发明创造，有重大推广价值的项目（包括尖端技术）有三百五十六件，改进工艺的有五千二百二十七件，改进设计的有二百件。全厂还出现了三十三条自动生产线和自动机组，有50％以上的机床实现了单机自动化与半自动化。另外还有一千一百多项手工操作实现了机械化。由于开展了技术革新和技术革命，这个正式投入生产不到五个月的现代化大企业，不但月月提前超额完成生产计划，而且只用两个多月的时间，生产能力就基本达到了原定一年达到的设计定额。目前全厂40％零件的生产能力已经达到翻一番的水平。
    第一拖拉机厂技术革新和技术革命运动的特点是，群众发动深透，方向明确、措施具体。在他们实现的革新项目中，不但有高、新、尖端的东西，而且也有许多花钱很少，解决了大问题的东西。如磨床震动式旋转送料机构，只增添了简单的附件和机构，就使无心磨床的加工实现了半自动化。这些项目，都是许多职工在一个明确的方向指引下群策群力实现的。其次是贯彻了“土洋并举”的方针，自力更生解决了许多关键问题。开始很多人一提自动化，都只想电气元件、程序控制等等精密的设备和仪器。后来职工们发扬了敢想敢干的精神，在不少车床上只增加了一些简单的凸轮装置，气动夹具，甚至利用简单的杠杆原理和机床本身的机械动作，以及震动力、离心力、水力等等土办法土设备，就实现了自动化和半自动化。如冲压车间三昼夜将全部压床实现了进退料自动化，就是利用压床的上下运动，通过不同的机械装置实现的。这种简单易行的革新，根本打破了过去有些人认为只电气化了才能自动化的保守思想。
    目前声势浩大的技术革新和技术革命群众运动，正在这个厂深入开展，他们的口号是：要叫现代化大企业发挥更大的威力。
