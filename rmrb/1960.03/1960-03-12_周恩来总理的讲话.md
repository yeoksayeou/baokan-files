Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech

Your Excellency Respected Prime Minister Koirala, Distinguished Guests, Friends, Comrades:

We are very pleased that His Excellency Mr. Koirala, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Nepal, has come to our country for friendly visit at the invitation of our government. Please allow me, on behalf of the Government and people of the People's Republic of China, to extend a warm welcome to Your Excellency and the Nepalese guests who have come to visit our country.

China and Nepal are friendly neighbors. The towering Himalayas, which lie between the two countries, have not only failed to block the establishment and enhancement of friendly relations between the two countries, but have also become a symbol of the long-standing and profound friendship between the two peoples. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Nepal, our traditional friendship has been further developed on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence through the joint efforts of both sides. In recent years, the friendly cooperation and ties between the two countries in political, economic, cultural and other fields have been increasingly strengthened. The continuous development of this friendly relationship between China and Nepal is not only in the interests of the two peoples, but also in the interests of peace in Asia and the world.

When I visited your country in 1957, I had the honor of meeting His Excellency Mr. Koirala and establishing a friendship. Today, I am particularly pleased to welcome Your Excellency in my own country. I firmly believe that your visit will further promote the friendly and good-neighborly relations between our two countries and contribute to the unity of Asian and African countries and world peace.

May the friendship between the Chinese and Nepalese peoples last forever!

I wish Your Excellency a successful visit!

    在首都机场上欢迎尼泊尔首相时的讲话
    周恩来总理的讲话尊敬的柯伊拉腊首相阁下，贵宾们，朋友们，同志们：
    尼泊尔王国首相柯伊拉腊先生阁下应我国政府的邀请，前来我国进行友好访问，我们感到十分高兴。请允许我代表中华人民共和国政府和人民对阁下和随同阁下来我国访问的尼泊尔贵宾们表示热烈的欢迎。
    中国和尼泊尔是友好的邻邦。横亘在两国之间的高峻的喜马拉雅山，不仅没有阻隔两国友好关系的建立和增进，而且成为两国人民悠久的深厚的友谊的象征。自从中尼两国建立外交关系以来，在双方的共同努力下，我们之间的传统友谊在和平共处五项原则的基础上，又有了新的发展。几年来，两国在政治、经济、文化以及其他方面的友好合作和联系，正在日益加强。中尼两国这种友好关系的不断发展，不仅符合于两国人民的利益，也符合于亚洲和世界和平的利益。
    我在1957年访问贵国的时候，曾经荣幸地同柯伊拉腊先生阁下会晤，并且建立了友谊。今天，我能在自己的国家里欢迎阁下，感到格外高兴。我深信，阁下的来访将进一步促进我们两国的友好睦邻关系，并且对亚非各国的团结和世界和平做出贡献。
    祝中尼两国人民的友谊万古长青！
    祝阁下访问成功！
