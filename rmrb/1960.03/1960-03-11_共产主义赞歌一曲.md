Outside the bus window, it was raining heavily, and the streets were deeply flooded. An old lady on the bus who wanted to get off hesitated: should she get off or not? At that moment, the conductor came over and carried her to the sidewalk where there was no water...

The conductors were off duty, but instead of going home to rest, they brought dry food and walked from the first stop to the last, a round trip of more than 20 kilometers, to understand what institutions, factories, streets, and entertainment venues were along the way; they conducted in-depth interviews with long-time residents to inquire about old streets and alleys that no longer existed due to the rapid pace of construction...

These are just a few examples of the work ethic of the conductors on Beijing's Route 13 and Route 14 buses. Under the leadership of the Party, they have established the idea that "Serving the people is the most glorious." They study the different psychological states of various passengers and try their best to help passengers solve problems; they diligently learn about the geographical situation along the route, striving to be "living maps" for passengers; they are kind, sincere, proactive, and enthusiastic towards passengers, and have established a new type of comradely relationship with them. Passengers praised the conductors' service attitude and warmly invited the conductors to visit their homes. Elderly people said, "Every time I take this bus, I'm sure to have a seat. This is truly because of Chairman Mao's good leadership and the goodness of socialism!" Young people said, "Your enthusiasm constantly encourages me to work better."

Our socialist motherland is truly the warm home of our 650 million people. No matter where you are, when you enter a department store, barbershop, bookstore, or restaurant, you are greeted by the smiles and warm reception of the service personnel. If you take a long-distance train from Heilongjiang to the coast of the South China Sea, you will feel as comfortable on the train as you are at home, and the conductors' meticulous service attitude will even make you feel more pleasant than at home.

The conductors of Route 13 and Route 14 buses have such a slogan: "Take the passengers' worries as your own worries, and the passengers' happiness as your own happiness." This is a great feeling, a noble emotion. This feeling enables them not only to work selflessly and without regard for compensation, but also to reach an even more touching state. Originally, as public bus conductors, being kind in attitude, making no mistakes in selling tickets, diligently announcing stops, and helping the elderly and pregnant women find seats would already be considered good enough. However, the comrades of Route 13 and Route 14 buses, who "take the passengers' worries as their own worries, and the passengers' happiness as their own happiness," do not stop there. They further improve their work to make passengers more satisfied. Without a strong idea that "Serving the people is the most glorious," it is impossible to do this. Starting from this idea, they become closely integrated with the passengers, sharing weal and woe, and establishing a new type of comradely relationship between people.

It is said that most of these conductors are new workers who just started working in 1958, and many of them are housewives. In our various industries today, especially in the service industries, there are a large number of such new employees and housewives. But they already have such noble thoughts and feelings and a brand-new spiritual outlook. From this, we can see how profound and tremendous changes have taken place in the spiritual realm of the broad masses of people under the leadership and education of the great proletarian party in the past few years! How many fragrant communist flowers have blossomed in people's hearts!

"We are not only good at destroying an old world, we are also good at building a new world" (Resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China). With the realization of the two great leaps forward, our productive forces are developing at a high speed. Under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, we are holding high the political banner of proletarian ideology, and socialist-communist consciousness is not only universally enhanced among industrial workers and working peasants, but also, from the conductors on Route 13 and Route 14 buses, most of whom are new workers and housewives, from their noble thought of "taking the passengers' worries as their own worries, and the passengers' happiness as their own happiness," we have seen a new spiritual world is forming among our broad masses of people. The widespread promotion of this communist morality makes everyone feel the warmth of the motherland, and also plays a role in mutual encouragement between people; it makes the broad masses of people feel comfortable, high-spirited, and full of energy, and builds our motherland better and faster. We praise the conductors of Route 13 and Route 14 buses, praise their noble moral qualities, and praise the beautiful present and the more brilliant future of the motherland!

    共产主义赞歌一曲
    梅原
    车窗外正下着倾盆大雨，街道积水很深，公共汽车上一位想下车的老太太踌躇着：下呢还是不下？就在这时，乘务员走过来，把她背到人行道上没水的地方去了，……。
    乘务员歇班了，但她们没有回家休息，而是带上干粮，从首站一直徒步走到末站，来回二十多公里，了解沿线有些什么机关、工厂、街道和娱乐场所；深入访问老住户，探询那些由于建设日新月异而已经不存在的旧街道、胡同。……
    这是北京十三路和十四路公共汽车乘务员的工作精神的点滴。他们在党的领导下，树立了“为人民服务最光荣”的思想。他们研究各类乘客的不同心理，千方百计帮助乘客解决问题；辛勤了解沿线地理情况，争当乘客的“活地图”；对乘客和蔼、诚恳、主动、热情，和他们建立了新型的同志式的关系。乘客们赞扬乘务员的服务态度，热情地邀请乘务员到自己家里去作客。老年人说：“每回坐这一路车，准有座，这真是毛主席领导得好，社会主义好！”青年人说：“你们的热情时刻鼓舞着我更好地工作。”
    我们的社会主义祖国，真是我们六亿五千万人民温暖的家。无论你在哪里，走进百货店、理发馆、书店、饭馆，迎接你的是服务员的微笑，亲切的接待。如果你从黑龙江乘长途火车到南海之滨，在列车上，你也会感到像在自己的家里一样舒适，而乘务员无微不至的服务态度，甚至使你感到比在家里还要愉快。
    十三路和十四路公共汽车乘务员有这样一个口号：“以乘客之忧为己忧，以乘客之乐为己乐。”这是一种伟大的情怀，高尚的感情。这种感情使他们在劳动中不仅作到了忘我和不计报酬，而且达到了更感人的境界。本来，作为公共汽车乘务员，作到态度和蔼，售票不出差错，到站勤叫，帮助老人、孕妇找座位，已经算是够好的了。可是“以乘客之忧为己忧，以乘客之乐为己乐”的十三路和十四路公共汽车的乘务员同志们，并不以此为止境，他们进一步把工作作得更好，使乘客更满意。没有坚强的“为人民服务最光荣”的思想，是作不到这样的。从这样的思想出发，他们便和乘客水乳交融、休戚相关，建立了人与人之间的新型的同志关系。
    听说这些乘务员，绝大部分是1958年刚参加工作的新工人，其中不少还是家庭妇女。在我们今天的各行各业中，特别是服务性行业里，是有着大量这样的新职工和家庭妇女的。可是他们已经有了这样崇高的思想感情和崭新的精神面貌。从这里，我们可以看到，几年来在伟大的无产阶级政党的领导和教育下，广大人民的精神领域是在起着多么深刻、多么巨大的变化！人们的心灵里开出了多少芬芳的共产主义鲜花！
   “我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界”
  （中国共产党七届二中全会决议）。两年大跃进的实现，我们的生产力正在高速度地向前发展。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我们高举无产阶级思想的政治帅旗，社会主义——共产主义觉悟，不仅在产业工人和劳动农民中普遍提高，而且，从绝大部分是新工人和家庭妇女的十三路和十四路公共汽车上的乘务员身上，从他们的“以乘客之忧为己忧，以乘客之乐为己乐”的高尚思想里，我们已看到一种新的精神世界，正在我们广大人民中形成。这种共产主义道德品质的普遍发扬，使我们每个人都感到祖国的温暖，而且在人与人之间，起了互相鼓舞的作用；它使广大人民心情舒畅，意气风发，干劲十足，更好更快地建设着我们的祖国。我们赞扬十三路和十四路公共汽车的乘务员，赞扬他们高尚的道德品质，赞扬祖国美好的今天和更加灿烂的明天！
