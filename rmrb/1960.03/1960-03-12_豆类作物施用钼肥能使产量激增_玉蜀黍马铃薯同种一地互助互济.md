    Applying Molybdenum Fertilizer to Leguminous Crops Can Drastically Increase Yield; Intercropping Corn and Potatoes Helps Each Other
    The All-Soviet Scientific Research Institute of Fertilizers and Agricultural Soil Science recently developed a molybdenum fertilizer that can increase the yield of leguminous crops by 20-30 centners per hectare. Experiments have shown that applying 100 grams of molybdenum fertilizer to one hectare of leguminous crop sowing land can greatly increase the harvest. On acidic soils, the yield of alfalfa can be increased by 8-10 centners per hectare, and sometimes even by 20-30 centners. At the same time, the quality of hay is good and contains more protein and carotene.
    Before using molybdenum fertilizer, the molybdenum salt needs to be dissolved in water, and then the solution is sprayed onto the sowing land. Planting seeds mixed with molybdenum salt powder in the ground can also achieve the same high yield. In addition, molybdenum fertilizer also helps to generally improve the fertility of non-black soil, because under its action, it can accumulate more nitrogen, which is important for plant nutrition.

    The conclusion recently reached by the Soviet breeder Khodikov after experiments is that co-planting corn and potatoes is beneficial to the growth of both crops.
    He conducted this experiment using the square-cluster planting method in a collective farm in Karelia. He planted a potato tuber and three corn seeds in each hole. Under proper management, they can help each other very well in growth. Initially, fast-growing potatoes can protect the heat-loving corn seedlings with their leaves in bad weather and frost. When the potatoes stop growing, the taller corn stalks can act as "protectors."
    Although last summer was dry, ten tons of potatoes and forty tons of corn green fodder were still harvested per hectare. Due to the reduction in heavy labor, the cost was reduced by almost half.

    豆类作物施用钼肥能使产量激增  玉蜀黍马铃薯同种一地互助互济
    全苏肥料和农艺土壤学科学研究所前不久制造了一种钼肥，它可使每公顷豆类作物增产二十——三十公担。根据试验证明，在一公顷豆作物的播种地上，施入一百克钼肥就能大大地增加收获量。在酸性土壤上，每公顷苜蓿的收获量可增产八——十公担，而有时竟达二十——三十公担。同时干草的质量好，并含有较多的蛋白质和胡萝卜素。
    在使用钼肥之前，需先把钼盐溶解于水中，然后再将溶液喷射到播种地上去。把拌有钼盐粉的种子种入地中，也可得到同样高的收获量。此外，钼肥同样有助于普遍提高非黑土的肥力，因为在它的作用下，可以更高地积蓄对植物营养起重要作用的氮。

    玉蜀黍和马铃薯共同种植，对这两种作物的生长都有利，这是苏联选种学家霍季科夫最近经过试验后得出的结论。
    他在卡累利阿一个集体农庄用正方穴播法进行了这一试验。他在每一个穴里种上了一个马铃薯块茎和三粒玉蜀黍种籽。在正确管理下它们在生长中可以很好地互助。在最初，生长迅速的马铃薯在天气不好和霜冻时可以以自己的叶子保护嗜暖的玉蜀黍的幼芽。当马铃薯停止生长时，长高了的玉蜀黍茎就可以充当“保护者”了。
    去年夏天虽然干旱，每公顷仍然收获了十吨马铃薯和四十吨玉蜀黍青饲料。由于繁重劳动量的减少，成本几乎降低了一半。
