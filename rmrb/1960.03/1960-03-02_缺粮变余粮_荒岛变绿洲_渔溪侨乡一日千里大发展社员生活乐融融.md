　　From Grain Shortage to Surplus, Barren Island to Oasis
　　Rapid Development in the Overseas Chinese Township of Yuxi, Happy Lives for Commune Members

　　(Our Dispatch) The Yuxi People's Commune in Fuqing County, Fujian Province, a well-known overseas Chinese township, is advancing by leaps and bounds under the leadership of the Party. In 1959, the average grain yield per mu in the entire commune reached 950 jin, an increase of more than 30% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, and more than double the normal yield before liberation. In the past, the entire commune had an annual grain shortage of more than 70,000 dan, but in 1959, there was a surplus of more than 128,000 dan, reversing the historical pattern of grain shortage.

　　There are more than 25,000 overseas Chinese from Yuxi township residing abroad, most of whom are working in Indonesia. There are more than 18,000 family members of overseas Chinese living in their hometown, accounting for 24.6% of the total population of the commune. The area is mountainous with little water and poor soil. Before liberation, more than 60,000 mu of the 86,000 mu of cultivated land were threatened by drought year-round, resulting in low yields and a hard life for the people. Therefore, large numbers of people were forced to leave their homes and seek a living overseas. After liberation, the Party and the People's Government led the people of the overseas Chinese township in a struggle to escape poverty, vigorously develop production, and create a happy life, carrying out agricultural capital construction focused on water conservancy. In the year since the establishment of the People's Commune alone, 125 water conservancy projects have been built in the entire commune. Together with the water conservancy projects built successively after liberation, the land in the entire commune has basically been freed from the threat of drought. The area with self-flowing and systematic irrigation has reached more than 52,000 mu.

　　Before liberation, Yuxi and its surrounding areas were known for having "one barren mountain after another, seeing only stones and no trees." Now, those desolate traces are gone. After liberation, especially after the establishment of the commune, afforestation achievements have been very significant. After the Spring Festival in 1959, more than 20,000 commune members in the entire commune planted 135,000 mu of forest in just a few days. Now, all the barren mountains suitable for forestry in the entire commune have been planted with trees and orchards. Jiangyin Island used to be a famous barren island at sea, but now the more than 55,000 mu of newly planted trees on the island have become forests.

　　Overseas Chinese who left Yuxi a decade ago will remember: there were no factories here, except for a small power plant that could only supply dozens of dim and flickering electric lights. Now, it's different. The commune has built more than 50 small factories, including agricultural implement factories, fertilizer factories, paper mills, brick and tile factories, and agricultural product processing factories. The agricultural implement factory produced more than 60,000 pieces of agricultural implements in a year. This is a sugar-producing area, and the old-fashioned sugar mills have been replaced by machine-made sugar factories.

　　The returned overseas Chinese and their families in the Yuxi Commune, like other commune members, are enthusiastically contributing their strength to various tasks and production construction. Liu Cunqing, a returned overseas Chinese from Indonesia, is the director of the commune's pig farm and has achieved success in his work. He and the entire staff of the farm overcame various difficulties, increasing the number of pigs in the farm from 28 to more than 1,500. He himself has also transformed from a layman into a pig-raising "native expert" and has been awarded the title of labor model in Fujian Province and Fuqing County. Yang Yamei, a young family member of overseas Chinese from the Jiangdou Brigade, led an "Ingenious Sisters" shock team of 18 women during the construction of the Houkeng Reservoir, increasing labor efficiency by nearly two times and completing the task ten days ahead of schedule. Yang Yamei was therefore named a water conservancy model worker. In the era of the Great Leap Forward, advanced model figures continue to emerge. In the year since the establishment of the Yuxi Commune, tens of thousands of model figures have been selected, of which more than 4,400 are returned overseas Chinese and their families.

　　With the development of production, the income and living standards of commune members have significantly improved. In 1959, more than 90% of the commune members increased their income; commune members who did not increase their income also received due care from the commune, ensuring that they had sufficient rations and living expenses. According to a survey, the income of 32 overseas Chinese families in the Fifth Team of the Yuxi Brigade in 1959 increased compared to 1958. Lin Kehua and his wife, who are relatives of overseas Chinese, participated in labor, and their total income in 1959 increased by 61% compared to 1958. Thanks to the commune's implementation of a system combining wages and supply, the family of seven has no worries about food. His five children have entered elementary school and nursery school. The family lives happily.

　　With the increase in income, the purchasing power of commune members has greatly increased. According to statistics from the commercial sector, retail sales of commodities (consumer goods) increased by 34% in 1959 compared to 1958. The number of commune members' savings and purchases of public bonds also increased significantly in 1958. There has also been great development in cultural, health, and other welfare undertakings. Before liberation, although there were 30 elementary schools and one middle school in the township, there were only 3,000 elementary school students and only 100 middle school students at that time. Now, the entire commune has established 102 elementary schools of various types, with more than 11,000 children attending school; the seven middle schools have more than 2,490 students; and more than 3,600 children are growing up happily in 92 nursery classes.

    缺粮变余粮　荒岛变绿洲
    渔溪侨乡一日千里大发展社员生活乐融融
    本报讯　福建省著名侨乡——福清县渔溪人民公社，在党的领导下，正在一日千里向前迈进。1959年全社粮食平均亩产达到九百五十斤，比大跃进的1958年增产三成多，比解放前的常年产量高二倍多。过去，全社每年要缺粮七万担以上，而1959年却有余粮十二万八千多担，改变了历年缺粮的面貌。
    渔溪侨乡旅居国外的侨胞达二万五千多人，其中大部分在印度尼西亚谋生，住在家乡的侨胞眷属有一万八千多人，占全社总人口的24．6％。这里山多水少，土壤贫瘠。解放前，八万六千多亩耕地中有六万亩以上常年受到干旱威胁，产量低，人民生活困苦。因此大批同胞被迫背井离乡到海外谋生。解放以后，党和人民政府领导侨乡人民进行了摆脱贫困、大力发展生产、创造幸福生活的斗争，进行以兴修水利为主的农田基本建设。仅人民公社成立后的一年来，全社兴修水利即达一百二十五处，加上解放以后陆续修建的水利工程，全社土地基本摆脱了干旱威胁。水利灌溉自流化、系统化的面积，达五万二千多亩。
    解放前渔溪一带是“荒山一座连一座，只见石头不见树”，现在，那些荒凉的痕迹不见了。解放后，特别是公社成立后，造林成绩非常显著。1959年春节后，全社有二万多个社员在几天内造林十三万五千亩。现在，全社的宜林荒山，都种了林木、果林。江阴岛过去是有名的海上荒岛，现在岛上新栽的五万五千多亩树木，已经成林。
    十年前渔溪一带出国的华侨还会记得：这里除了一个只能供应数十盏明灭无常的电灯的小小发电厂以外，没有别的工厂。现在，可不同啦。公社新建的农具厂、肥料厂、造纸厂、砖瓦厂和农产品加工厂等小型工厂，有五十多个。农具厂一年当中制成了六万多件农具。这里是产糖区，过去的土糖坊已被机器制糖厂所代替。
  渔溪公社的归侨侨眷们和其他社员一样，在各项工作和生产建设中热情地贡献出自己的力量。印度尼西亚归侨刘存庆，担任公社养猪场的场长，工作有成绩。他和全场职工一起克服了各种困难，使全场养猪头数由二十八头发展到目前的一千五百多头。他自己也从一个门外汉变为养猪“土专家”，获得福建省的和福清县的劳动模范称号。江兜大队的青年侨眷杨亚妹，在修建后坑水库时，领导十八个妇女组织“巧姊妹”突击队，提高劳动效率近两倍，提前十天完成任务。杨亚妹因此被评为水利模范。在大跃进的年代里，先进模范人物不断涌现，渔溪公社成立一年来，评选出成万个模范人物，其中有四千四百多个是归侨和侨眷。
    随着生产的发展，社员收入和生活水平有了显著提高。1959年全社90％以上的社员增加了收入；没有增加收入的社员也得到了公社应有的照顾，保证他们有足够的口粮和生活费用。据调查，渔溪大队第五中队三十二户侨眷1959年的收入都比1958年增加。侨属林克华夫妻二人参加劳动，1959年总收入比1958年增长61％。由于公社实行工资制和供给制相结合的制度，一家七口不愁吃。他的五个孩子分别进了小学和托儿所。一家生活乐融融。
    随着收入的增长，社员的购买力大大增加了。据商业部门统计，1959年商品（消费品）零售额比1958年增长34％。社员储蓄和购买公债的数字，也比1958年有很大的增加。在文化卫生等福利事业方面，也有很大发展。解放前全乡虽说有三十来所小学、一所中学。当时，小学生只有三千人，中学生只有一百多人。现在，全社已办起各种小学一百零二所，上学的儿童超过一万一千人；七所中学有学生二千四百九十多人；九十二所幼儿班里，有三千六百多个幼儿在幸福地成长。
