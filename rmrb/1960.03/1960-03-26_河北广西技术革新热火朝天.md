Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 25th: A technological innovation and revolution movement centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization is spreading rapidly like a chain reaction to all corners of the industrial and transportation fronts of Hebei Province, and is constantly deepening. Many industries and factories have begun to move towards automation and comprehensive technological transformation.

    Industries with a Weak Technological Foundation Take the Lead
    Mechanization and Semi-Mechanization Progresses by Leaps and Bounds

In this technological revolution storm, workers in industries and mining enterprises with heavy manual labor took the lead, with mechanization and semi-mechanization blooming everywhere. In just over two months, workers have put forward more than 4.75 million innovation proposals, equivalent to 1.35 times the total number of innovation proposals in the entire last year. The degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization has increased from about 38% at the beginning of this year to more than 50%. According to statistics from Tianjin, Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, and Baoding alone, more than 230,000 people have discarded sledgehammers, shovels, carrying baskets, and shoulder poles, and started operating various machines. Coal industry workers, focusing on liberating heavy manual labor, simplifying production processes, and saving pit props, launched a mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, hydraulic engineering, and pit prop substitution movement, fundamentally reforming ten aspects including coal mining methods, development and tunneling, mine masonry, geological surveying, pit prop consumption, transportation and hoisting, and safety production. Nearly 100,000 iron and steel "small foreign groups" heroes have shown their skills in the technological revolution, rapidly increasing the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization, and refreshing the pig iron production figures every day. In early March, the province's average daily pig iron production increased by 2.84% compared to the average in February, and the daily production level in the first six days of mid-March increased by 14.25% compared to early March. Thirteen iron smelting plants and more than 110 small blast furnaces in the province have achieved a utilization coefficient of more than two.

        Innovation Knows No End, Better Must Be Even Better, Higher Must Be Even Higher
        The Goal is for One Person to be Worth Several, One Factory to be Worth Several

The rapid increase in the level of mechanization and semi-mechanization has further liberated the minds of the vast number of workers. They are not satisfied with the innovation results they have achieved, and are holding high the red flag of continuous revolution, striding into a new stage of comprehensive technological transformation. In production practice, many industries and factories are constantly improving and perfecting the newly created machinery; automated and semi-automated factories and workshops are emerging one after another. According to incomplete statistics, 1,311 automatic production lines and 3,530 automated single machines have emerged in the province. The proportion of automated operations on the industrial front in Tianjin has increased from 0.32% at the beginning of the year to the current 2%. In the automated small rolling mill workshop of the No. 1 Branch of Tianjin No. 1 Steel Plant, workers move the operating lever, and a red-hot steel billet automatically shoots into the rolling mill groove, and then passes through the forward and reverse surrounding disc, from one groove into another, and in less than a minute it becomes a forty-meter-long ribbed steel bar. The number of production workers per shift has been reduced from thirteen to three, and the shift output has increased from twenty tons to more than one hundred tons. The trough lock chain scraper conveyors in Kailuan and Jingxing coal mines have all been remotely controlled and centrally controlled. After comprehensive technological transformation, many industries and factories have "put new clothes on old factories and new guns on old soldiers." More than 3,000 manually operated wooden and iron frame looms in more than 170 production units in the weaving industry in Tianjin have all been transformed into electric automatic looms, and the labor productivity of workers has increased by more than two times, achieving one person being worth two people, and one factory being worth two factories. Through comprehensive technological transformation, Tianjin Weaving and Dyeing Factory has realized the continuity of the entire dyeing process, combining thirteen processes such as singeing, desizing, washing, refining, and dyeing into one, fundamentally changing the production appearance. The production cycle has been shortened from 72 hours to about 5 hours. Many industries are also constantly adopting new technologies and new processes, improving product design, and carrying out comprehensive utilization. New technologies and new processes such as hot air smelting in the metallurgical industry and precision casting in the machinery industry have been widely promoted and applied.

        Learn Culture, Study Technology, Climb Peaks
As the movement of mechanization, semi-mechanization, automation, and semi-automation continues to develop, the enthusiasm of the vast number of workers to learn culture, learn technology, and climb scientific peaks is increasing day by day. Many factories and enterprises have transformed the mass-established amateur "processing plants," three-in-one "research institutes," and "design institutes" into technical schools, and are running amateur education on a large scale. Many workers have rapidly improved their technical operating skills and technical theoretical knowledge through learning, research, and practice. The number of amateur universities and amateur secondary technical schools run by the industrial departments in Tianjin has increased from 57 to 213, and the number of students enrolled has increased from more than 12,000 to more than 25,000, attacking science and technology. After the technical level of the vast number of workers has improved, it has promoted the further deepening of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, March 24th: Workers of all ethnic groups in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are working hard on the industrial, transportation, and capital construction fronts, making technological innovations and technological revolutions with the spirit of running iron and steel on a large scale. From the four industrial-intensive cities of Liuzhou, Nanning, Guilin, and Wuzhou to small coal mines throughout the region, from small and medium-sized wharves to construction sites scattered throughout the area, more than 20,000 workers have laid down their shovels, sledgehammers, and shoulder poles, freeing themselves from heavy manual labor. In enterprises with a better mechanical foundation, more than 200 automatic production lines and more than 600 single-machine automations have also appeared.

        Grasp the Key, Order Planning, Clarify the Main Attack Direction

Guangxi's industrial base is relatively weak. Except for a few newly built enterprises, most of the manual operations account for a high proportion. In terms of transportation, the contradiction between advanced transportation tools and backward loading and unloading is very prominent. The autonomous region has a large capital construction task this year, with tight schedules, and few construction machines. The Party committees at all levels in the autonomous region analyzed and studied these characteristics, formulated technological innovation and technological revolution plans, and proposed that they should first start from casting and forging, mining, loading and unloading, handling, crushing, and construction with a large proportion of manual operations and heavy physical labor. , and other aspects, and then the movement will be universally developed to all walks of life and all auxiliary departments.

        Wharf Loading and Unloading, Coal Mine Transportation Eliminates Shoulder Carrying

The vigorous development of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement has promoted an overall leap in production and rapidly changed the backward technical outlook. Nanning Port, which used to rely on manual labor for 80% of its loading and unloading, realized mechanization and systematization of loading and unloading, vehicle transportation, and crane hoisting within 20 days. The loading and unloading efficiency increased by two to 25 times, saving 1,360 laborers, and the port's daily throughput increased from 1,200 tons to 4,100 tons. The berthing time of ships was shortened from seven days to less than one day, which is equivalent to increasing the transportation volume by more than double. In the small and medium-sized coal mines throughout the autonomous region, mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations have spread to drilling, blasting, coal falling, coal piling, drainage, loading and unloading, ventilation, and other work types. Nadou Coal Mine in Tiandong County, which used to rely entirely on manpower for production, is now using local machines designed and manufactured by workers for underground coal transportation, ground coal transportation, and loading ships, eliminating the phenomenon of manual carrying. The daily output of coal has increased from 80 tons to more than 500 tons, and the number of production workers has been reduced from 400 to 104. Due to the daily surge in production, small coal mines in Nanning, Baise, and Yulin prefectures have all overfulfilled their first quarter production plans one month and 25 days ahead of schedule, respectively.

        Competition Promotes Innovation, Innovation Consolidates Competition

Guangxi's technological innovation and technological revolution movement developed on the basis of the "advanced class competition centered on technological innovation and technological revolution" in the fourth quarter of last year. Therefore, the movement quickly developed from general single-item technological innovation to complete sets of reforms. Eight major construction and installation enterprises in the autonomous region began to make technological innovations into lines and sets at the end of last year. From January to early February this year, 418 advanced machine tool sets were matched in nineteen processes such as bricklaying, steel bars, concrete, plastering, and painting. On average, construction efficiency was 102 times higher than in the past, saving more than 53,600 workdays, and the completed workload increased by 138% compared to the same period last year. The punching, pressing, shearing, joining, rolling, buttoning, forging, and other processes in the cold forging work type of the machinery industry have completely realized mechanized and semi-mechanized operations.

            Large Collaboration Style is Greatly Promoted

Mutual support, going to help when difficulties are seen, and helping the backward, is another feature of the movement. Within the factory, cooperation was launched between workshops, work types, teams, individuals; outside the factory, cooperation was launched between regions, systems, factories, factories and schools, and factories and scientific research institutions. Factories with better equipment help small factories to realize mechanization and semi-mechanization in all aspects.

    河北广西技术革新热火朝天
    河北
    据新华社天津25日电以机械化半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，犹如连锁反应，迅速扩展到河北省工业、交通运输战线的各个角落，并且不断深入发展，许多行业和工厂已经开始迈进自动化和全面技术改造的新阶段。
          技术基础较差的行业一马当先
          机械化半机械化进度一日千里
    在这次技术革命风暴中，笨重体力劳动较多的行业和厂矿企业职工一马当先，在机械化半机械化方面普遍开花。在短短的两个多月内，职工提出革新建议四百七十五万多件，相当于去年全年革新建议总数的一点三五倍。机械化半机械化程度已由今年年初的38％左右提高到50％以上。仅据天津、唐山、石家庄、保定四个市的统计，就有二十三万多人丢掉了大锤、铁锨、抬筐和扁担，开动起各种各样机械。煤炭工业职工以解放笨重体力劳动，简化生产过程和节约坑木为主攻方向，开展了机械化、半机械化、自动化、水力化和坑木代用化运动，对采煤方法、开拓掘进、矿井凿砌、地质勘测、坑木消耗、运输提升、安全生产等十个方面进行了根本性的改革。近十万名钢铁“小洋群”英雄们，在技术革命的风浪中，大显身手，迅速提高机械化半机械化程度，使生铁产量日日刷新。3月上旬，全省生铁平均日产量比2月份平均提高了2．84％，3月中旬的头六天的日产水平又比上旬提高了14．25％。全省已有十三个炼铁厂、一百一十多座小高炉利用系数达到了二以上。
        革新无止境好了要更好高了要更高
        奋斗目标是一人顶数人一厂顶数厂
    机械化半机械化水平的迅速提高，进一步解放了广大职工群众的思想，他们不满足已得的革新成果，高举着不断革命的红旗，跨进了全面技术改造的新阶段。许多行业、工厂在生产实践中，对新创造出来的机械不断改进提高，日趋完善；自动化、半自动化的工厂、车间接连不断出现。截至目前不完全统计，全省已涌现出自动生产线一千三百十一条、自动化单机三千五百三十台，天津市工业战线自动化操作的比重已由年初的0．32％提高到目前的2％。天津第一钢厂一分厂出现的自动化小型轧钢车间，工人一搬操纵把，一块通红的钢坯便自动从烘钢炉里窜进轧钢机槽孔，再通过反正围盘，从一个槽孔穿进另一个槽孔，不到一分钟就变成了一条四十多米长的罗纹钢筋，每班生产工人由过去的十三人减少到三人，班产量由二十吨提高到一百多吨。开滦、井陉煤矿的顺槽锁链刮板运输机，已经全部实现了远方操纵集中控制。许多行业、工厂经过全面技术改造，使“老厂换了新装，老兵换了新枪”。天津市织布行业一百七十多个生产单位三千多台手工操纵的木架、铁架织布机，已全部改造成为电力自动织布机，工人劳动生产效率提高了二倍以上，实现了一人顶两人，一厂顶两厂。天津织染厂通过全面技术改造，实现了染布全部生产过程连续化，把烧毛、退浆、水洗、精炼、染布等十三道工序“合而为一”，从根本上改变了生产面貌，生产周期由过去的七十二个小时缩短为五个小时左右。许多行业还不断的采用新技术、新工艺，改进产品设计，大搞综合利用。冶金工业的热风熔炼，机械工业的精密铸造等新技术、新工艺，都得到了广泛的推广和运用。
        学文化钻技术攀登高峰
    随着机械化、半机械化、自动化、半自动化运动的不断发展，广大职工群众要求学习文化、学习技术、攀登科学高峰的热情日益高涨。许多工厂企业都把群众建立起来的业余“加工厂”、三结合“研究院”、“设计院”等革新组织变成了技术学校，大办业余教育。许多工人通过边学习、边研究、边实践，迅速提高了技术操作水平和技术理论知识。天津市工业部门举办的业余大学、业余中等技术学校，已由五十七所增加到二百一十三所，入学人数由一万二千多人增到两万五千多人，猛攻科学技术。广大职工技术水平提高以后，又促进了技术革新和技术革命运动的进一步深入发展。
    广西
    据新华社南宁24日电　广西僮族自治区工业、交通、基本建设战线上各族职工奋发图强，以大办钢铁的气魄大闹技术革新和技术革命。从工业集中的柳州、南宁、桂林、梧州四市到遍及全区的小煤矿，从中小码头到分散各地的建筑工地，目前已有两万多名工人放下了铁锹、大锤和扁担，从繁重的体力劳动中解脱出来。在机械化基础较好的企业里，还出现了两百多条生产自动线，六百多台单机自动化。
          抓关键订规划　明确主攻方向
    广西工业基础比较薄弱，除开少数新建企业以外，大部分手工操作比重很高；交通运输方面，先进的运输工具同落后的装卸之间，矛盾十分突出，自治区今年基本建设任务大，工期紧，而施工机具少。自治区各级党委分析研究了这些特点，制订技术革新和技术革命规划，提出要首先从手工操作和笨重体力劳动比重大的铸锻、采矿、装卸、搬运、破碎，以及基本建设方面的吊装、砌砖、土方、运输等方面开始，然后使运动普遍发展到各行各业和一切辅助部门。
          码头装卸煤矿运输消灭肩挑人背
    技术革新和技术革命运动的蓬勃发展，推动了生产全面跃进，迅速改变了技术落后面貌。过去80％靠人挑肩扛装卸的南宁港，二十天内就实现了装卸机械化、系统化，运输车子化，起重吊车卷扬化，装卸效率提高两倍到二十五倍，节约了一千三百六十个劳动力，使港口日吞吐量由一千二百吨上升到四千一百吨，船舶停港时间由七天缩短到不满一天，等于增加运量一倍以上。在全自治区的中小煤矿里，手工操作机械化半机械化已遍及打眼、爆破、落煤、攉煤、排水、装卸、通风等工种。过去生产全靠人力的田东县那读煤矿，现在井下运煤、地面运煤、装船都用上了工人自己设计制造的土机器，消灭了人挑现象，煤的日产量由八十吨提高到五百多吨，生产工人由四百人缩减为一百零四人。由于生产逐日激增，南宁、百色、玉林三个专区的小煤矿都已分别提前一个月、二十五天超额完成了第一季度生产计划。
          竞赛推动革新　革新巩固竞赛
    广西的技术革新和技术革命运动，是在去年第四季度“以技术革新和技术革命为中心的先进班组竞赛”基础上发展起来的。所以，运动很快就由一般的单项技术革新发展到成套改革。自治区八个主要建筑安装企业，去年年底就开始使技术革新成线、成套，今年1月到2月上旬，砌砖、钢筋、混凝土、抹灰、油漆等十九个工序就实现先进机具配套成龙四百一十八条，施工效率平均比过去提高一百零二倍，节省了五万三千六百多个工日，完成的工程量比去年同期增长138％。机械工业冷锻工种中的冲、压、剪、接、卷、扣、锻等工序，已完全实现了机械化半机械化操作。
            大协作风格大发扬
    互相支援，见困难就上，见后进就帮，是运动的另一个特色。在厂内，车间与车间、工种与工种、班组与班组、个人与个人展开了协作；在厂外，地区与地区、系统与系统、厂与厂、工厂与学校、工厂与科学研究机关展开了协作。设备较好的工厂，从各方面帮助小厂实现机械化半机械化。
