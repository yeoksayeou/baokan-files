City of Red Pine
Wang Zhao, First Secretary of the CPC Yichun Municipal Committee

Yichun is only a little over ten years old this year. When the red sun rises from the east, and the layered, undulating mountains gently shed the veil covering them, a new city on the banks of the Tangwang River, facing the mountains and backed by water, with mountains surrounding it, awakens. Whether you take a city bus or a train traversing the city, you will see the red marker light on top of the tall water tower, shining brilliantly in the misty morning glow; red, white, and light yellow buildings stand tall in the natural flower garden, surrounded by the endless sea of trees on the mountains, meeting the white clouds, forming a beautiful brocade screen; from the newly built airport in the west of the city, a "Forest Eagle" takes off, this loyal patrolman, facing the morning sun, circles above the city, constantly watching over the safety of the forest. Large and small trains, cars, and tractors carrying timber come and go endlessly; the crisp whistle sounds from the lumberyards, the sounds of machinery loading and unloading timber, and the whistles of the timber processing plants intertwine, driving away the emptiness and silence of the mountains.

When you climb the high mountain opposite the city and look down at the great forest below, the pure white birch trees, the towering large poplar trees, the straight and beautiful Amur cork trees, ash trees, walnut trees... surround the pine forest, forming a harmonious and dense forest world. When a breeze blows, the pine waves roll for thousands of miles, like a green ocean. But among the many species of trees, people's favorite is still the red pine, the crown of the forest and the king of trees. It has beautiful patterns, good material, wide use, and great elasticity, making it a treasure for construction. It stands upright on the mountainside illuminated by the morning sun, or on the mountain peaks towering into the clouds. Each crown stands out from the forest layer like a pagoda. When spring comes, it sprouts tufts of light and even new buds, beautifully adorning its head; in midsummer, its lush green attire, set against the colorful sunset, appears particularly solemn; in autumn, the orange-yellow fruits are abundant, like countless pineapples weighing down the branches; when the sharp north wind blows, and all kinds of trees, flowers, and grasses in the forest timidly shed their leaves and wither, the red pine stands tall on the snow-covered mountains, showing its extraordinary tenacity. Yichun, known as the "Hometown of Red Pine," is not only a treasure trove, but also as beautiful as the red pine.

People sing praises of the mountains here as the Mountains of Ten Thousand Treasures, the rivers as the Rivers of Gold and Silver, and the trees as the Money Trees. Long ago, it was said that when tigers and bears roamed here, and human footprints had not yet arrived, red lights and strange colors often appeared on the boundless mountains at night, illuminating the sky and the forest, radiating from the treasures in the mountains to attract the blessed. Beside the shimmering river in the valley, a jet-black steed often drank water by the river and galloped on the mountains. The water it drank turned into a silver river, and the mountains it ran on flashed with golden light. It galloped and neighed along the banks of the river. Whoever could tame it, whoever could move the gold mountain and silver river, would no longer suffer, and a new world would appear on the Lesser Khingan Mountains, bringing a happy life.

Some foreigners once traveled across the ocean to come here, wanting to catch the black horse, open the treasure house, and move away the priceless treasures, but in the end, all their efforts were in vain!

During the enemy and puppet rule, the dark clouds of disaster obscured the sun. Countless precious timbers were plundered by the enemy, leaving waist-high tree stumps on the hillsides. The forests were burned, and even the wild animals had to escape. The captured laborers and forestry workers endured painful and endless labor. Countless people died from cruel persecution, and countless people died from freezing and starvation. At that time, this treasure mountain became a human prison, filled with desolation and wounds. The red light on the treasure mountain disappeared, and the black horse was nowhere to be found. By the time of liberation, the people left in the mountains were few and far between!

In those dark and desperate days, it was the Anti-Japanese Allied Army led by the Communist Party that gave people the courage to fight and the confidence to live. In order to defend the beautiful rivers and mountains and the endless treasures of the motherland, the Party led the suffering people, holding high the red flag of anti-Japanese liberation. The people living here cooperated with the Anti-Japanese Allied Army, tenaciously persisted in the anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare, and buried countless enemies in the forest. Even now, the relics of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army's clothing factory, communication school, and the Fifth Regiment of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army's camp in the Wuying area still remain on the banks of the Uma River. Many revolutionaries used their own blood to irrigate the forests and flowers, and planted the seeds of happiness. When Chairman Mao walked onto Tiananmen Square and announced to the world the great moment of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the first building marking the birth of this city was built on the desolate Tatou meadow. From then on, a new and brilliant chapter unfolded.

The Party and the government paid close attention to the development of this treasure trove, invested huge amounts of money, and transferred cadres and workers here. Some of them were veterans who had fought north and south for the liberation of the motherland and made meritorious contributions; some were "old timbermen" from the foot of Changbai Mountain, young adults from the banks of the Songhua River and the Yangtze River, and Shandong Han; and some were college students from the capital and Shanghai. Under the common will to open the treasure trove of the Lesser Khingan Mountains and participate in socialist construction, they encouraged and helped each other, forming a united and harmonious family, and carried out urban construction work centered on forestry production.

When the first batch of builders appeared here in 1949, it was the spring of recovery, and the birds and forests were singing and welcoming the true masters. In the original virgin forest, there were only a few thatched huts, inhabited by a few hunting families. Herds of roe deer and sika deer stared in surprise at the newcomers, leaping through the forest gaps. One can imagine how difficult it was to build a new city out of thin air in such a place! A tenacious battle began: resisting mosquito attacks, resisting the severe cold of minus forty degrees, opening mountains, splitting ridges, digging ditches, draining water, trampling out footpaths from the bushes to carry production and living materials, building bridges over the turbulent Tangwang River, and building factories and schools in the endless Tatou meadow, where countless towering ancient trees were uprooted. People's hands cracked, their feet were frostbitten, and their faces were bitten by mosquitoes, but their strong will and heroic labor finally overcame all kinds of difficulties and built a city group of nearly 500,000 people, connected by railway and highway networks extending in all directions, consisting of more than a dozen large and small towns, on the desolate mountains and fields on both sides of the Tangwang River! Therefore, when outsiders want to see this city, they need to take a two- or three-hour flight or a ten-hour train.

Due to the regulating effect of the great forest on the natural climate, the air in the city is fresh, the winters are warm and the summers are cool, the scenery is pleasant, and it is free from the suffering of wind and sand. When the ice river thaws and the Dahurian rhododendrons bloom, the girls laugh and sing in groups, starting to weave a new green dress for the earth in the open spaces and forest farms. On the rushing and noisy Tangwang River, peach blossom water rolls, and the river is full of timber flowing downstream for thousands of miles, flowing obediently into the lumberyard in the whistling of the cattle drivers. In June, the Lesser Khingan Mountains become an exquisite, picturesque hometown, with hundreds of flowers blooming, fragrant for thousands of miles. Later, emerald clouds run horizontally on the mountains, and clear streams trickle at the foot of the mountains. At this time, if you want to whet your appetite and eat some fresh daylilies, wild grapes, persimmons, or mountain treasures such as fungus and monkey head, it is very easy. You can take a basket to the forests and meadows in the suburbs and choose freely.

In the cool autumn of September, people stand on the balconies outside the buildings, looking at the rolling waters of the Tangwang River and the colorful mountains and forests, and cannot help but recite Chairman Mao's poem: "Behold, the mountains are a riot of color, the forests are dyed crimson... ten thousand creatures compete in the frost-kissed sky." It is in this intoxicating autumn scenery that the mountains bring abundant products to the city's residents: orange-yellow mountain pears, fragrant and delicious dog dates, walnuts wrapped in green skins, crispy hazelnuts... endless to eat, endless to pick. Various medicinal materials, oil crops, and fodder are all over the mountains and forests, waiting for people to dig and collect.

When snowflakes are flying all over the city, a silver-white world, the branches of the red pines are already full of heavy snowballs, the sun shines, the green trees and silver flowers are beautiful and moving. At this time, the city is more active than ever. On the streets, happy children glide to school in twos and threes, stepping on self-made ice skates and carrying schoolbags. In the skating rinks in the city, the 5,000-meter race is beginning. A crowd of happy people appeared again on the hillside opposite, rushing down the steep slope from mid-air, and then circling back up the mountain... At this time, it is the golden season for forestry production. Tractors and large trucks are dispatched together, and thousands upon thousands of horses run on the slopes, collecting and transporting timber on the frozen river surface and artificial ice roads. Hunters carry guns and tools, ride horses or put on skis, and go to the forest to hunt wild deer, roe deer, and otter for mink and otter skins.

The Great Leap Forward since 1958 has made this vibrant city, like a strong eagle, spread its wings and leap forward. Now, the blessed people who hold the keys to the treasure house, hold the reins of the black horse, and can move the gold mountain and silver river, are creating a new world in the Lesser Khingan Mountains. People have come to understand that these blessed people are none other than the working people of workers and peasants living in this city, the slaves of the old society, and the true masters of today. Under the leadership of the Party, they are turning the fantasies of the past into reality. Now, walking on the streets at night, many mountains do indeed emit red light, which is the smelting of several iron and steel plants. The new steel plant building has also been completed. Two modern and large-scale timber processing plants are under construction in intense construction. Soon, they will make full use of forest resources to produce various exquisite, gorgeous, and colorful fiberboards and sound insulation boards to supply construction needs. They can also produce a large amount of alcohol, dry ice, extract nylon raw material furfural and nutritious feed yeast, and also make bread for people to eat.

On the surface of the Yichun River, formed by the confluence of the Uma River and the Cuiluan River, stands a building. At night, tens of thousands of lights emanate from this building, illuminating the river into a silver belt, circling the city walls and flowing into the Tangwang River. This is the first hydropower station built by 100,000 people in voluntary labor in 1958. Before long, another medium-sized hydropower station under construction on the Tangwang River will send even greater currents to the whole city, turning the night of the city and the Lesser Khingan Mountains into day. At that time, people will use even stronger productive forces to fully develop and utilize the endless treasures of Yichun and serve the socialist construction of the motherland. The city of Yichun will also show itself to us in a more beautiful and majestic manner.

    红松之城
    中共伊春市委第一书记　王钊
    伊春今年才只有十岁多一点。当红日从东方升起，层林迭嶂的万里青山，轻轻地脱掉披在她身上的纱装时，在汤旺河畔，面山背水，水外环山的一座新城市，就苏醒了。不论你坐上市内的公共汽车，或坐上纵穿市区的火车，就会看到高大的水塔顶上的红色标志灯，在晨雾迷漫的朝霞中，闪耀着灿烂的光芒；一幢幢红色、白色、淡黄色的楼房，屹立在自然的花圃中，四周山上绵亘的树海和朵朵白云相接，构成了一幅美丽的锦屏；从城西新建的机场上，飞起了一只“林鹰”，这个忠诚的巡逻兵，迎着早晨的太阳，盘旋在市区的上空，时刻注视着森林的安全。载运木材的大、小火车，汽车，拖拉机往来不绝；贮木场上清脆的?号声，装卸木材的机器声，木材加工厂的汽笛声交织在一起，赶走了山林的空旷、寂静。
    当你攀登上城对面的高山，观览下面的大森林，那洁白的小桦树，参天的大青杨，笔直秀美的黄菠萝，水曲柳，胡桃秋……簇拥着松林组成了和谐稠密的森林世界，微风吹来，松涛万里，犹如一片绿色的海洋。但在繁多的树种里面，人们最喜爱的还是林中之冠，树中之王的红松。它花纹美，材质好，用途广，弹力大，是建筑的珍品。它挺立在朝阳照射的山腰间，或高耸云端的山巅上，一座座树冠，宝塔似地突出在林层上面。春天来了，它冒出一撮撮清淡匀正的嫩芽，秀美的点缀在头上；仲夏，它那浓绿的装束，衬托在万紫千红的夕阳里，又显得格外庄严；到了秋天，橙黄色的果实累累，就像无数菠萝压满枝头；等到朔风尖利的吹来，森林里各种树木花草，都胆怯地脱掉叶子，枯萎了，红松却挺立在白雪皑皑的山峦上，显示出与众不同的坚韧不拔的性格。素以“红松故乡”著称的伊春，不仅宝藏无尽，而且像这红松一样风姿多娇。
    人们歌颂这里的山是万宝山，河是金银川，树是摇钱树。老早以前，传说这里虎熊出没，人的足迹尚未到过的时候，黑夜里，无边的山岭上常常出现红光异彩，映红天，映红森林，那是山中宝库里的宝贝为招引有福人而放射的。山谷中那条银光闪闪，激荡着微波的河旁，有一匹乌黑的骏马常常在河边饮水，在山岭上奔驰，它饮过的水，就变成银河，它跑过的山，就闪现金光，它在沿河两岸奔驰嘶鸣，谁能驯服它，谁能搬走金山、银河，谁就不再受苦，小兴安岭上就会出现新的世界，带来幸福的生活。
    有些外国人曾远渡重洋来到这里，想逮住乌马，打开宝库，搬走无价宝，可是结果，都枉费心机了！
    敌伪统治时代，灾难的阴云遮住了太阳，无数珍贵的木材被敌人抢走，山坡上留下了齐腰高的树根，森林被焚烧，野兽也不得不逃避。被抓来的劳工和林业工人，进行着痛苦的和无休止的劳动，说不清多少人死于残酷的迫害，多少人死于冰冻、饥饿。那时这座宝山成了人间的监狱，到处是一片凄凉和创伤。宝山上的红光不见了，乌马也无踪了。到了解放时，山林里留下来的人已寥若晨星！
    在黑暗绝望的日子里，是共产党所领导的抗日联军，给了人们斗争的勇气和生活的信心。为了保卫祖国的锦绣河山和无尽的宝藏，党领导着受苦受难的人们，高举抗日解放的红旗。生活在这里的人们配合抗日联军，顽强地坚持抗日游击战争，把无数敌人埋葬在森林里。直到现在，乌马河岸上还遗留着抗联的被服厂，通讯学校，五营地区抗联五团的宿营地等遗迹。许多革命者用自己的鲜血，灌溉了森林、花草，埋下了幸福的种子。当毛主席走上天安门向全世界宣告中华人民共和国成立的伟大时刻，标志着这个城市诞生的第一座楼房，在荒无人烟的塔头草甸上兴建起来，从此，展开了她灿烂的新的诗篇。
    党和政府十分关注这座宝库的开发，拿出了巨大的投资，调来了干部和工人。他们中有的是为祖国解放事业南征北战，立下功勋的转业军人；有的是长白山麓的“老木把”，松花江、扬子江岸的青壮年和山东汉；还有首都和上海来的大学生。他们在打开小兴安岭宝库参加社会主义建设的共同意志下，互勉互助，结成了团结、和睦的大家庭，进行以林业生产为中心的城市建设工作。
    当1949年第一批建设者在这里出现的时候，正是万物复苏的春天，鸟儿和森林都欢唱着，迎接着真正的主人。原始的处女林里，仅有几间草房，住着几户猎民，成群结队的獐狍野鹿，惊诧的望着新来的人，在林隙间窜跃着，天真的小熊好奇地跑到工人们的帐篷里来玩耍。可以想象，在这样一个地方平空建设起一座新城市，是何等的不易！顽强的战斗开始了：抵御着蚊虫的袭击，抵御着零下四十度的酷寒，开山，劈岭，挖渠，排水，从灌木丛中踩出人行道来背运生产、生活物资，在湍急的汤旺河上架起桥梁，在无边无沿的塔头草甸，连根拔掉无数参天古树的地方，盖起工厂、学校。人们的手震裂了，脚冻伤了，脸被蚊虫咬破了，可是坚强的意志，豪迈的劳动，终于战胜了种种困难，在汤旺河两岸荒凉的山野上，建设起一个通过四面八方的铁路网、公路网连接十数个大小城镇组成的近五十万人口的城市群！所以当外来人想要浏览这个城市的时候，需要坐上二、三小时的飞机，或十几小时的火车才行。
    由于大森林对自然气候的调节作用，市内空气清新，冬暖夏凉，风景宜人，不受风沙之苦。当冰河解冻，达子香花盛开的时候，姑娘们成群结队地笑着，唱着，开始在林间的空地和林场上，给大地织补绿色的新装。在奔腾喧闹的汤旺河上，桃花水翻滚，满河的木材顺流而下，一泻千里，在赶羊工人的?号中，驯服的流到贮木场。6月时节，小兴安岭上更成了一个绝妙的诗情画意之乡，百花盛开，芳香千里。再后，山峦上翠云横断，山脚下清流潺潺。这时你要想开开胃口，吃点新鲜的黄花菜，山葡萄，?柿，或者木耳，猴头之类的山珍，那很容易，可以提上篮子到城郊的森林里，和草甸子上，自由地选择。
    9月的凉秋，人们站在楼外的阳台上，望着碧波滚滚的汤旺河水，和五颜六色的山林，不由不咏出毛主席的诗句：“看万山红遍，层林尽染……万类霜天竞自由”就在这秋色醉人的时刻里，满山上给城市居民送来了丰富的产品：那橙黄色的山梨，清香可口的狗枣子，包裹在青皮里的核桃，香脆的榛子……吃不尽，采不完，各种药材油料，饲料等遍布山林，等待着人们去挖采。
    当满城雪花飞扬，一片银白，红松的枝头早压满了沉甸甸的雪团，阳光照耀，绿树银花，娇丽动人。这个时候，这个城市比任何时候都更加活跃起来了。街道上，欢乐的孩子们踏着自做的滑冰刀，背着书包，三三两两向学校滑去。城内一个个滑冰场上，五千米比赛正在开始。对面山坡上又出现了欢乐的人群，一忽儿从半空的陡坡上急驰而下，一忽儿又迂回地冲上山头……。这时候，正是林业生产的黄金季节，拖拉机、大汽车，一齐出动，成千成万的马套子在山坡上奔跑，在冻结的河面和人造冰道上集运着木材。猎人们背上枪，带上工具，骑上马或蹬上滑雪板到森林里去追捕野鹿、獐狍，猎取貂皮、水獭。
    1958年以来的大跃进，使这个充满了青春活力的城市，像健壮的雄鹰，舒展开它的翅膀，飞跃向前。现在，手里拿着宝库钥匙，牵着乌马缰绳，并能搬走金山、银河的有福人，正在小兴安岭上创造新世界。人们已经懂得这些有福人不是别人，正是生活在这个城市里的工农劳动群众，是旧社会的奴隶，今天的真正的主人，他们在党的领导下，把过去的幻想变成现实。现在，夜里走到街上，许多山上确实冒出了红光，那是几处炼铁厂、钢厂正在冶炼。新的炼钢厂房也已经落成。两座近代化规模宏大的木材加工厂在紧张施工兴建，不久它们将充分利用森林资源，生产各种精美、华丽，五光十色的纤维板、隔音板，供应建筑需要，还可以生产大量的酒精、干冰，还要提炼出尼龙原料糠醛和营养丰富的饲料酵母，也可以制作人吃的面包。
    在由乌马河和翠峦河汇流而成的伊春河的河面上，耸立着一座建筑物。入夜，从这座建筑物里发出万盏灯光，把河水照耀成一条银带，萦绕着城垣注入到汤旺河里去。这是1958年出动了十万人次的义务劳动建成的第一座水电站。不要多久，正在汤旺河上施工兴建的另一座中型水电站，即将向全市发出更大的电流，把全市，把小兴安岭的黑夜变成白天。那时人们将以更加强大的生产力，把伊春的无尽宝藏充分开发利用起来，为祖国的社会主义建设服务。伊春市，也将以更美丽的雄姿展现在我们的面前。
