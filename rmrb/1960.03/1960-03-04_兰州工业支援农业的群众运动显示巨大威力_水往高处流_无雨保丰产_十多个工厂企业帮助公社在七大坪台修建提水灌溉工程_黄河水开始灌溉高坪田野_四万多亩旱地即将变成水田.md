The mass movement of industry supporting agriculture in Lanzhou demonstrates tremendous power.

Water flows uphill; bumper harvests are guaranteed even without rain.

More than ten factories and enterprises help the commune build water lifting and irrigation projects on the seven major platforms.

Yellow River water begins to irrigate high platform fields; more than 40,000 mu of dry land is about to become paddy fields.

(Reported by our newspaper) A broad and magnificent mass movement of industry supporting agriculture is unfolding in Lanzhou. The Lanzhou Refinery, Lanzhou Chemical Plant, Lanzhou Water Supply and Drainage Company, Lanzhou Xigu Thermal Power Plant, the First and Second Companies of the Third Engineering Bureau, the Electromechanical Installation Company, the Gansu Prospecting Machinery Plant of the Ministry of Geology, and the No. 3 Division of the Capital Construction Company of the Provincial Electric Power Industry Bureau, along with more than ten other factories and enterprises, are undertaking specific responsibilities without affecting their own production. They are fighting alongside their farmer brothers to build large-scale powered mechanical water-lifting projects on the seven major platforms, drawing Yellow River water to the arid high-platform fields. This can increase irrigated land by 47,000 mu (including 12,000 mu benefiting Yondeng District), ensuring a large increase in production without rain and a bumper harvest even in severe drought. As of February 25, water had been pumped to six platforms, irrigating 29,000 mu of land. The water-lifting project for the remaining Qingshitai platform is being accelerated and is expected to start supplying water before the end of March.

The seven platforms on the north and south mountains of Lanzhou are new bases for melons, fruits, and vegetables opened up by farmers in the suburbs of Lanzhou in 1958. All of the more than 35,000 mu of land is dry land, and the yield is very low, far from meeting the needs. In accordance with the spirit of high-speed agricultural development, the Lanzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has vigorously promoted the propaganda and education of industrial support for agriculture and accelerated the technological transformation of agriculture to factory workers, and has taken specific measures to assign factories to different areas to focus on water conservancy construction. The Municipal Party Committee decided to establish seven electric pumping stations on the seven major platforms of Fanjiaping, Zhangdajia Terrace, Zhamatai, Qingshitai, Liugouping, Sanyuanmao, and Ma'ershan. Using the power supply of the Xigu Thermal Power Plant, the Yellow River water is pumped to the arid platforms, which are more than 120 to more than 170 meters high, forming a complete irrigation system to promote the rapid development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery on the platforms.

The project of lifting water up the mountains to the seven major platforms started in December last year. The main projects are the construction of seven electric pumping stations, including the construction of 21 pumping houses, the installation of 38 water pumps, a total length of 40 kilometers of transmission lines, as well as a large amount of earth and stone work and pipeline engineering. The total power required for water to the seven major platforms is 11,244 horsepower. After completion, the total flow rate will be 3.428 cubic meters per second. Under the specific leadership of the Lanzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Industrial Support Agriculture Committee, the Lanzhou Refinery, Xigu Thermal Power Plant and other units have undertaken specific responsibilities from surveying and designing, civil engineering, construction, and installation to training technical workers. At the same time, factories and enterprises and the major brigades of the People's Commune are divided into cooperation zones to form a cooperation network. The Party Committee Secretaries of each factory and enterprise take the lead, and professional teams composed of factory directors, engineering technicians, etc., are dispatched, and more than 600 workers of various types of work such as civil engineering, installation, and electric welding are dispatched to carry out large-scale winter construction on the arid platforms.

The seven major platforms are 1,600 to 1,800 meters above sea level, and the terrain is uneven. The characteristics of the construction are large pumps, long pipelines and transmission lines, and a ditch-crossing project that is 200 meters wide and 400 meters deep. In order to save time and concentrate superior forces to complete projects that can produce benefits before spring planting and summer planting, they adopted the method of designing, preparing materials, and constructing at the same time. Workers in each factory worked hard and cleverly, overcoming the shortage of materials and equipment and the many difficulties in design and construction. When the construction site lacked 50-horsepower head water pumps, the workers adopted the method of multi-stage water lifting and water pump series to solve the problem. The water lifting project of Zhangdajia Terrace has to cross two gullies 203 meters wide and 48 meters deep. In order to shorten the construction period and ensure spring irrigation, the relevant construction units cooperated with each other and modified the plan three times, changing the originally designed earth dam project to water diversion with iron rope wooden frame gasoline barrels, which greatly saved labor. During the construction, the workers tried every means to save steel and cement. The migrant workers in the earth and stone works also carried out tool reforms, using tamping machines to tamp, wooden winches to transport soil, etc., which greatly improved work efficiency.

The enthusiastic support of the workers further inspired the enthusiasm of the farmers. In order to ensure that the project will produce results as soon as possible, the farmers established water conservancy professional teams to rush to repair the main canals and branch canals, erect flumes, improve transportation conditions, and seize the time to level the land to ensure that spring irrigation will begin as soon as the water is on the platform.

In the tide of industry supporting agriculture, local hospitals sent people to the construction site to see patients, the financial and trade system collected insulation materials for winter construction, local garrison troops participated in voluntary labor, cotton mills supported cables, and various construction companies raised welding rods. Employees in all walks of life are contributing to supporting agriculture, forming a moving situation of universal mobilization. The revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses accelerated the progress of the project. By the end of February, 15 pumping houses had been completed, and six major platforms had started to supply water ahead of schedule, ensuring spring irrigation. Today, looking far at the seven major platforms, high-voltage transmission lines cross the blue sky, and the pumping houses, reservoirs, and mountain-climbing embankments on the platforms are clearly visible. The mass movement of industry supporting agriculture at high speed has exerted unparalleled power, and finally, in less than three months, it has led the Yellow River water to the high platform fields that have been dry for thousands of years, laying the foundation for realizing water conservancy and painting a picture of a garden-like landscape for the seven major platforms in the future. The commune members praised the new achievement of the friendship between workers and peasants, saying: The cooperation between workers and peasants has great power, realizing agricultural modernization, eliminating drought and achieving bumper harvests; vegetables, melons and fruits are sweet and plentiful, and given to the older worker brothers.

    兰州工业支援农业的群众运动显示巨大威力
    水往高处流　无雨保丰产
    十多个工厂企业帮助公社在七大坪台修建提水灌溉工程
    黄河水开始灌溉高坪田野  四万多亩旱地即将变成水田
    本报讯　兰州市展开波澜壮阔的工业支援农业的群众运动。兰州炼油厂、兰州化工厂、兰州市给排水公司、兰州西固热电厂、第三工程局一、二公司、机电安装公司、地质部甘肃探矿机械厂、省电力工业局基建公司三处等十多个工厂企业，在不影响本单位生产的情况下，分片包干，同农民兄弟并肩作战，在七大坪台兴建大规模的动力机械提水工程，把黄河水引上了干旱的高坪田野，可以增加水地四万七千亩（包括永登区受益的一万二千亩），确保无雨大增产，大旱大丰收。到2月25日止，已有六个坪台开始上水，可灌地两万九千亩。剩下的青石台坪的提水工程正在加紧施工，3月底以前也可以开始上水。
    兰州市南北两山的七个坪台，是兰州郊区农民在1958年新开辟的瓜果蔬菜基地。三万五千多亩土地全是旱地，产量很低，远远不能满足需要。中共兰州市委根据高速度发展农业的精神，大张旗鼓地向工厂职工进行了工业支援农业，加速农业技术改造的宣传教育，并且采取工厂分片包干的具体措施，大抓水利建设。市委决定在范家坪、张达家台、扎马台、青石台、柳沟坪、三元帽、马耳山七个大坪上建立七座电力扬水站，利用西固热电厂的电源，分层把黄河水抽上一百二十多米到一百七十多米高的干旱大坪，形成完整的灌溉系统，以促进坪上农、林、牧、副、渔业的迅速发展。
    七大坪台提水上山工程，是从去年12月开始施工的。主要工程是建立七座电力扬水站，包括修建二十一座泵房，安装三十八台水泵，总长四十公里的输电线路，还有大量的土石方工程和管道工程。七大坪上水所需的动力，总计一万一千二百四十四马力，修成后，总流量是三点四二八秒立方。在中共兰州市委和工业支援农业委员会的具体领导下，从勘测设计、土建、施工、安装，到培训技术工人，都是由兰州炼油厂、西固热电厂等单位分片包干。同时，将工厂企业和人民公社的各大队，划定协作区，组成协作网。各工厂企业党委书记挂帅，抽调厂长、工程技术人员等组成专业小组，派出土建、安装、电焊等各工种的工人六百余名，在干旱的大坪上展开大规模冬季施工。
    七大坪台海拔一千六百至一千八百米，而且地势不平，施工的特点是泵大、管道和输电线路长，有宽二百米、深四百米的过沟工程。为了争取时间，集中优势力量完成春播、夏播前能够收到效益的工程，他们采取了边设计、边备料、边施工的方法。各工厂职工大干巧干，克服了材料设备不足和设计、施工上的重重困难。当工地缺少五十马力的扬程水泵时，工人们就采取多级上水和水泵串连的办法解决。张达家台的提水工程，要渡过两条二百零三米宽、四十八米深的沟道，为了缩短工期保证春灌，各有关施工单位互相协作，修改了三次方案，把原来设计的土坝工程，改用铁索木架汽油桶引水，大大节省了劳动力。施工中，工人们千方百计节约钢材、水泥。土石方工地的民工队，也大搞工具改革，用打夯机打夯、木制卷扬机运土等，大大提高了工效。
    工人们的热情支援，更加鼓舞了农民的积极性。为了保证工程早见效益，农民成立了水利专业队，抢修毛渠、支渠，架渡槽，改良运输条件，抓紧平整土地，保证水一上坪，就马上春灌。
    在工业支援农业的浪潮里，当地医院派人下工地看病，财贸系统为冬季施工收集保温材料，当地驻军参加义务劳动，棉纺厂支援电缆，各建筑公司凑集电焊条。各行各业的职工，人人都为支援农业出力，形成了全民动员的动人局面。群众的革命干劲加速了工程进度。到2月底，有十五座泵房已经完工，六个大坪开始提前上水，保证了春灌。如今，远望七大坪台，蓝天下横过了高压输电线，坪上泵房、蓄水池、上山堤坝历历在目。工业支援农业高速度发展的群众运动，发挥了无比的力量，终于在不到三个月的时间里，把黄河水引上了千古干旱的高坪田野，为实现水利化奠定了基础，为来日七大坪画出一幅园田化美景。公社社员赞美这个工农友谊的新成就说：工农协作力量大，实现农业现代化，消灭干旱大丰产；蔬菜瓜果甜又多，送给工人老大哥。
