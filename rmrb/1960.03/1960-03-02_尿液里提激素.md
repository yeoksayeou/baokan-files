Urine, generally, people think it has no other use than as fertilizer. In fact, urine has great uses in medicine.

Pharmaceutical scientists from the Shanghai Biochemical Pharmaceutical Factory and other units, in the scientific research activities of vigorously engaging in comprehensive utilization, have extracted more than ten kinds of hormones from urine. Some can accelerate the reproduction of livestock and fish, and make poultry lay more eggs; some can treat neurasthenia, stomach diseases, peptic and duodenal ulcers, gynecological diseases, arteriosclerosis, hypertension and other diseases. It seems that urine, which is not very useful, has begun to serve people's health.

    尿液里提激素
    尿，一般人都认为除了作肥料之外，再没有别的用途了。其实，尿在医药上的用途很大。
    上海市生物化学制品厂等单位的医药科学工作者，在大搞综合利用的科学研究活动中，从尿液中提取出十多种激素，有的可使牲畜、鱼类加速繁殖，使家禽多产卵；有的可治性神经衰弱、胃病及十二指溃疡、妇女病、血管硬化、高血压等病症。看来用处不大的尿，已开始为人们的健康服务了。
