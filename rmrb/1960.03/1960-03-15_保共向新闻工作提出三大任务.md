Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, March 13th: The Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party stated in its congratulatory message to the Congress of the Bulgarian Journalists' Union: "We are in favor of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, but in the realm of ideology, there is absolutely no peaceful coexistence between socialism and capitalism. Socialist ideology is opposed to bourgeois ideology, and a sharp, irreconcilable struggle is being waged between them."

The congratulatory message from the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee was read to the congress by Grigorov, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee. He represented the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee at the recently concluded congress.

The congratulatory message highly praised the contributions made by Bulgarian journalists to socialist construction and called on them to unite more closely around the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee and strive to complete the three major tasks facing them.

The three major tasks pointed out in the congratulatory message are: (1) To play a greater propaganda and organizational role in realizing the policies of the Party and the government, in successfully completing and overfulfilling Bulgaria's program for accelerated economic development, and in completing Bulgaria's socialist construction; (2) To conduct ideological work more extensively and regularly, and to strengthen the communist education of the people; (3) To expound the current international situation better and more clearly from a Marxist-Leninist standpoint, to expound the profound changes in the world balance of power in favor of socialism, and the ever-increasing struggle of the people of all countries against war and for lasting peace and complete disarmament.

The congratulatory message pointed out that in order to wage a sharp and irreconcilable struggle against bourgeois ideology, newspapers, radio, and television must constantly expose the reactionary policies and ideology of the reactionary bourgeoisie and imperialism, expose the policies and ideology of the right-wing social democrats and revisionists, and shatter their pseudo-scientific and deceptive "theories" ideologically and politically.

In strengthening the communist education of the people, the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee called on Bulgarian journalists to use newspapers, radio, and television to help the working people establish a Marxist-Leninist world outlook and communist morality, cultivate new people, eliminate the remnants of bourgeois ideology and morality, oppose individualism and the psychology of private ownership, oppose religious prejudice, and expose and severely condemn everything old and decadent that still remains in Bulgarian life.

The Congress of the Bulgarian Journalists' Union was held in Sofia from the 11th to the 12th of March. The congress summarized the work of the Bulgarian Journalists' Union.

The reports and speeches at the congress showed that the Bulgarian socialist journalism has greatly developed in the fifteen years since liberation. At present, there are 686 kinds of newspapers and periodicals published nationwide, with a total daily circulation of 6,385,237 copies. The congress unanimously pointed out that these achievements are the result of the direct leadership and meticulous care of the Bulgarian Communist Party for journalism.

The congress also elected the leading body of the Bulgarian Journalists' Union. Balkov, editor-in-chief of "Workers' Cause" and alternate member of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee, was elected chairman of the association.

The congress unanimously adopted a letter to the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee. The letter stated that Bulgarian journalists are determined to unite more closely around the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee and become true assistants of the Party in the Party's organizational and political work in the struggle for the final victory of socialism.

    保共向新闻工作提出三大任务
    一、为完成社会主义建设起更大的宣传和组织作用
    二、经常进行思想工作，加强对人民的共产主义教育
    三、更鲜明地从马克思列宁主义出发阐明国际局势
    新华社索非亚13日电　保加利亚共产党中央委员会在给保加利亚新闻工作者协会代表大会的贺词中说：“我们赞成社会制度不同的国家和平共处，但是，在思想意识领域内，社会主义和资本主义绝没有任何和平共处。社会主义思想意识与资产阶级思想意识是相对立的，并且进行着尖锐的、不可调和的斗争。”
    保共中央的贺词是由保共中央书记处书记格里戈罗夫向大会宣读的。他代表保共中央出席了新近闭幕的这次代表大会。
    贺词对保加利亚新闻工作者在社会主义建设中作出的贡献给予了很高的评价，并且号召他们更加紧密地团结在保共中央周围，为完成他们面临的三项主要任务而努力。
    贺词中指出的三项主要任务是：（一）为实现党和政府的政策、为胜利完成和超额完成保加利亚加速发展经济的纲领和完成保加利亚社会主义建设起更大的宣传作用和组织作用；（二）更加广泛地和经常地进行思想工作，加强对人民的共产主义教育；（三）更好地和更鲜明地从马克思列宁主义立场出发阐明当前的国际局势，阐明有利于社会主义的世界力量对比的深刻变化，以及各国人民反对战争、争取持久和平和全面裁军的日益高涨的斗争。
    贺词指出，为了同资产阶级思想进行尖锐的、不可调和的斗争，报刊、广播和电视就必须经常揭露反动的资产阶级与帝国主义的政策和思想意识，揭露右派社会民主党人和修正主义者的政策和思想意识，从思想上和政治上粉碎他们伪科学的和蛊惑性的“理论”。
    在加强对人民的共产主义教育方面，保共中央号召保加利亚新闻工作者通过报刊、广播和电视帮助劳动人民树立马克思列宁主义的世界观和共产主义道德，培养新人，清除资产阶级思想和道德的残余，反对个人主义和私有制心理，反对宗教偏见，揭露和严斥那些还残留在保加利亚生活中的一切旧的和腐朽的东西。
    保加利亚新闻工作者协会代表大会于11日到12日在索非亚举行。这次代表大会总结了保加利亚新闻工作者协会的工作。
    大会上的报告和讲话表明，解放后十五年来，保加利亚社会主义新闻事业已经有了很大的发展。现在，全国发行的报刊共有六百八十六种，每日发行总量达六百三十八万五千二百三十七份。大会一致指出，这些成绩的取得，是保加利亚共产党对新闻事业的直接领导和无微不至的关心的结果。
    代表大会还选举了保加利亚新闻工作者协会的领导机构。“工人事业报”总编辑、保共中央候补委员鲍科夫当选为协会主席。
    大会一致通过了给保共中央的一封信。信中表示，保加利亚新闻工作者决心更加紧密地团结在保共中央的周围，在争取社会主义的最终胜利的斗争中，在党的组织工作和政治工作中，成为党的真正助手。
