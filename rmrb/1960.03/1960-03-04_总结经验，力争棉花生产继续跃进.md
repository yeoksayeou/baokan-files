To Sum Up Experience and Strive for Continued Leap Forward in Cotton Production
Sima Yi Yasheng Nuofu, Director of the Rural Work Department of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Xinjiang has vast, fertile land, abundant water resources relying on artificial irrigation, a dry climate, and a long frost-free period, making it an ideal cotton-growing region in the motherland. However, before liberation, the region's cotton field area was only 460,000 mu, with a yield of only 20.7 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and a total output of less than 100,000 dan, which could not meet the needs of the people in the region. After ten years of development since liberation, especially after the great leap forward in agricultural production in the past two years, compared with 1949, the cotton field area in 1959 expanded by 3.5 times, the yield per mu increased by 2.7 times, and the total output increased by more than 15 times. This not only meets the needs of the autonomous region's textile industry and civilian use, but also provides some cotton for export and supports the needs of the textile industry in inland areas, which strongly supports national construction and promotes the development of the entire national economy of the autonomous region. This fact powerfully illustrates that under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, holding high the banner of the general line and the Great Leap Forward, a new situation of the Great Leap Forward and bumper harvests in agricultural production can emerge, and cotton production can also achieve high-speed development.

	Grain and Cotton Leap Forward Together

The production of cotton in Xinjiang, whether in terms of area, yield per unit, or total output, has seen great development in the past ten years. This is mainly because the Party organizations at all levels in Xinjiang have resolutely implemented the policy of taking grain as the key link to develop agricultural production. Under the premise of giving priority to increasing grain production, Xinjiang has vigorously developed cotton and other cash crops, and has correctly formulated the ratio of grain and cotton production areas. Taking the grain and cotton production areas of the past two years of the Great Leap Forward as an example, the grain sowing area accounts for about 70% of the total sowing area, and cotton accounts for about 7%. As a result of the increase in grain and cotton production in the past two years, the total grain output increased by 72% compared with 1957, and the total cotton output increased by 65.5%. This rate of growth not only ensures the grain needs of the country and the people of all ethnic groups, but also meets the needs of the country and the people for cotton. The cotton-growing areas in Xinjiang generally achieved self-sufficiency in grain with a surplus, enabling both grain and cotton to develop at a high speed in a planned and proportionate manner. In the process of developing cotton production, we have adhered to the principle of simultaneously increasing yield per unit area and expanding the sown area, which effectively guarantees the high-speed development of cotton production. Taking the two years of the Great Leap Forward as an example, the cotton yield per unit area increased by 10.31% in 1958 compared with 1957, and by another 25.12% in 1959 compared with 1958; the sown area increased by 7.75% in 1958 compared with 1957, and by another 11.31% in 1959 compared with 1958. This shows that the "walking on two legs" policy of developing cotton production is completely correct. Due to the formulation of a practical cotton-grain price ratio (at present, the average price ratio of cotton and wheat in various parts of the autonomous region is one to eight), for several years, it has neither affected the enthusiasm of the masses to produce grain, nor encouraged and stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses to produce cotton, thus achieving a double leap forward and double harvest in grain and cotton production.

	Adhere to Putting Politics in Command

Under the leadership of the Party, we have adhered to putting politics in command and launching mass movements, which has led to the emergence of many large-area and high-yield cotton fields in Xinjiang, which has powerfully promoted the high-speed development of cotton production in the entire region. The Manas River basin, which had never grown cotton before liberation, now has large cotton fields and has achieved a large-area high yield of 400 jin of unginned cotton per mu in tens of thousands of mu, breaking the superstition that it is impossible to grow cotton in the cold northern Xinjiang; the entire region has emerged with Turpan, McGaiti, and Shanshan, these counties with a yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and five regiments (farms) of the Production and Construction Corps with a yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu; the area with a yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu in the entire region has reached more than 300,000 mu. In the large-area high-yield movement, many cotton-growing experts have emerged throughout the region. For example, comrades Liu Xuefo and Xue Zhanchun of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps created the national cotton high-yield records in 1955 and 1956 with yields of 1,392 jin and 1,686 jin of unginned cotton per mu respectively. In 1958, comrades Xu Haijia and Xue Mingzhe created a high-yield record of 3,677.13 jin of unginned cotton per mu. The Turpan Cotton Experimental Station created a high-yield record of 782 jin of unginned cotton per mu of long-staple cotton. These red flags on the cotton production front have encouraged and enhanced the confidence of the masses in cotton high-yield and greatly promoted the high-yield harvest movement of cotton production.

The high-speed development of cotton production in Xinjiang is the result of the struggle combining the transformation of nature and the transformation of thinking. Under the original weak cotton-growing foundation, we widely and deeply mobilized the masses, and implemented methods such as soil improvement, crop rotation, and increasing the application of organic fertilizer in a planned and step-by-step manner to cultivate and improve old cotton fields; we used methods such as land reclamation and crop rotation to expand new cotton fields, turning the vast Gobi Desert into a good cotton-growing base; we created cotton field forest belts and planted sorghum crops around the cotton fields to prevent wind and sand attacks; we adopted the principle of prevention before treatment, early treatment, less treatment, and thorough treatment, and artificial prevention and control as the main method and chemical prevention and control as the auxiliary method, to prevent and control the harm of various diseases and insect pests. These measures ensure the continuous expansion of cotton field area and the continuous achievement of high yields in cotton production. These facts have established the great ambition of "man will conquer nature" in the minds of the vast number of cadres and the masses, laying a solid ideological foundation for the continuous leap forward in cotton production in the future.

	Vigorously Carry Out Technical Innovation

To vigorously develop cotton production, we must vigorously carry out mass movements for technical innovation and technical revolution. In this movement, we have grasped the link of reforming cotton-growing tools, because this is the central content of cotton-growing technology reform. Before liberation, the sowing and cultivation of cotton in Xinjiang completely relied on backward manual tools. After liberation, these tools were continuously improved. At present, some areas of the autonomous region have realized the mechanization of cotton planting, and most areas have achieved semi-mechanized operation, which greatly improved labor efficiency, shortened the cotton sowing period, and ensured the planting quality of cotton, fundamentally changing the backward state of extensive cultivation such as broadcasting, sparse planting, shallow cultivation, and no fertilization in history. The cotton areas in the autonomous region have widely implemented timely early sowing, row sowing, and rational close planting, and some areas have also promoted advanced technical measures such as square-hole planting and transverse thinning; according to different climates, soils, and cotton seedling growth conditions, we have adopted sufficient base fertilizer, reasonable topdressing in stages, and appropriate use of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers; advocated economical water use, and promoted horizontal irrigation and infiltration irrigation; a series of field management tasks such as thinning, fixing seedlings, cultivating, pruning, and topping have formed a relatively complete scientific system. In the cotton planting practice, the vast number of cadres and the masses, through on-site visits and comparisons, promoted advanced experiences, carried out the ideological struggle between the advanced and the backward, and continued to set off a mass movement to learn from the advanced, compare with the advanced, and catch up with the advanced in improving cotton production technology, thus continuously appearing large-area and high-yield events in cotton fields, powerfully promoting the high-speed development of cotton production in the entire region.

	Realized Improved Varieties

Vigorously carrying out cotton variety improvement is an economical and effective measure to improve cotton yield and quality. Before liberation, all cotton seeds in Xinjiang were local varieties, with low yield and poor quality; after liberation, the Party and the government attached great importance to the improvement and popularization of cotton varieties, combining the introduction of foreign improved varieties with the cultivation of local improved varieties, combining professional cotton improved variety breeding experiments with the seed fields of the masses, combining breeding with promotion, and carrying out mass movements for improved variety breeding throughout the region, establishing seed management institutions at all levels, breeding and promoting various excellent varieties according to local conditions and time, so that all cotton-growing areas in the autonomous region have realized improved varieties. Practice has proved that selecting and promoting excellent varieties with strong adaptability, strong disaster resistance, and high yield can achieve high yields. The cultivation and popularization of a new excellent variety requires a long time, so we must pay attention to maintaining the purity of the improved variety and preventing the improved variety from hybridizing and degrading; any new improved variety will inevitably degrade after a certain period of time due to the adverse effects of the natural environment and artificial cultivation; therefore, we must constantly and continuously cultivate new improved varieties to meet the constantly developing needs of cotton production.

Make Good Preparations for Cotton Planting and Strive for High Yield

In order to meet the needs of socialist construction, this year we will continue to expand the cotton planting area and increase the yield per unit area, and strive to increase the total output by about 40% compared with 1959; among them, the area of long-staple cotton will be expanded more than six times, and the yield per mu will be increased by about 20%. This is an extremely arduous and glorious task on our cotton production front. In order to give full play to the potential for increasing cotton production, we must still adhere to putting politics in command, launch mass movements, and try every possible means to reform cotton planting technology.

The cotton sowing period is approaching, and we must accelerate the completion of a series of preparations such as selecting suitable cotton land, carefully selecting and transferring improved varieties, preparing sufficient base fertilizer for cotton fields, and repairing cotton planting tools, so as to put into the cotton planting battle in a timely manner. We must give full play to the efficiency of machinery and animal-drawn farm implements, rationally arrange labor and animal power, improve cotton planting efficiency, reform cotton planting technology, ensure complete and vigorous seedling emergence, and lay a reliable foundation for cotton high yield.

To achieve a bumper harvest of cotton, we must pass the three barriers of seedling protection, bud protection, and boll protection. Seedling protection is the basis for increasing cotton production; ensure complete and vigorous seedlings, and strictly prevent natural disasters from attacking, so as to promote the healthy growth of seedlings; to prevent the shedding of buds and bolls, we must pass a series of technical barriers such as fertilization, irrigation, cultivation, pruning, and topping, and effectively control cotton growth, concentrate nutrients to ensure more early bolls, reduce bud and boll shedding, and promote cotton precocity, and strive for high quality and high yield.

Launch a Movement for a Yield of 1,000 Jin of Unginned Cotton per Mu

Xinjiang will launch a cotton high-yield competition and a movement for a yield of 1,000 jin of unginned cotton per mu this year, and establish red flags and pacesetters on the cotton production front in communes, teams, and farms, so as to establish the confidence of the vast number of cadres and the masses in achieving greater high yields. This year, the entire region will vigorously carry out cotton high-yield plots, so that the large-area high-yield fields will reach about 20% of the total cotton field area, so as to drive the overall cotton high-yield movement. Seasonal visits, comparisons, and year-end overall evaluations must be carried out between counties and counties, communes and communes, and teams and teams. At the same time, we must summarize and promote advanced cotton planting experiences, help backward communes and teams catch up with the advanced, overcome the disparity in cotton production levels, and achieve overall cotton production increase. Cotton production technology in Xinjiang has been greatly improved in the two years of the Great Leap Forward. However, at present, cotton production technology is still far behind the needs of the objective situation of the Great Leap Forward. Therefore, we must vigorously mobilize the masses and push the technical innovation and technical revolution movement to a new stage.

    总结经验，力争棉花生产继续跃进
    中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会农村工作部部长  司马益·牙生诺夫
    新疆有广阔、肥沃的土地，有依靠人工灌溉的充足水源，气候干燥，无霜期较长，是祖国理想的植棉地区。但在解放前，全区棉田面积仅有四十六万亩，亩产量仅二十点七斤皮棉，总产量不足十万担，生产的棉花还不能满足本区人民的需要。解放后，经过十年来的发展，特别是经过近两年来的农业生产大跃进，1959年与1949年相比，棉田面积扩大了三点五倍，亩产量提高了二点七倍，总产量增长了十五倍以上。这不仅满足自治区纺织工业和民用的需要，而且还有一部分棉花可供出口和支援关内纺织工业需用，有力地支援了国家建设，促进了自治区整个国民经济的发展。这一事实有力地说明了在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，高举总路线、大跃进的红旗，农业生产就能够出现大跃进、大丰收的新形势，棉花生产也能获得高速度地发展。
        粮棉双跃进
    新疆棉花的生产，不论面积、单产、总产，在十年来都有很大的发展，这主要是新疆各级党组织坚决贯彻执行了以粮为纲发展农业生产的方针。在优先增产粮食的前提下，新疆大力发展棉花和其他经济作物，并且正确地制定了粮棉生产面积的比例。以大跃进两年来的粮棉生产面积为例，粮食播种面积占总播种面积的70％左右，棉花占7％左右。两年来粮棉增产的结果，粮食总产比1957年增长72％，棉花总产增长65．5％。这样增长的幅度，既保证了国家和各族人民的粮食需要，又满足了国家和人民对棉花的需要。新疆植棉地区一般做到了粮食自给有余，使粮食、棉花都能够有计划、按比例地高速度发展。在发展棉花生产的过程中，我们坚持了提高单产和扩大播种面积同时并举的方针，这就有效地保证了棉花生产的高速度发展。以大跃进的两年为例，棉花单位面积产量1958年比1957年提高10．31％，1959年又比1958年提高了25．12％；播种面积1958年比1957年增加了7．75％，1959年又比1958年增加了11．31％。这说明发展棉花生产的“两条腿走路”的方针是完全正确的。由于制定了切合实际的棉粮比价（目前自治区各地棉花和小麦的平均比价为一与八之比），几年来既不影响广大群众生产粮食的积极性，也鼓励和刺激了广大群众生产棉花的热情，因而取得了粮棉生产的双跃进、双丰收。
        坚持政治挂帅
    在党的领导下，我们坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，使新疆地区的棉花生产出现了不少大面积和高额丰产田，有力地推动了全疆棉花生产的高速度发展。解放前从未种过棉花的玛纳斯河流域，现在出现了大片棉田，并获得了几万亩亩产籽棉四百斤的大面积丰产，破除了北疆寒冷不能植棉的迷信；全区出现了吐鲁番、麦盖提、鄯善这几个亩产皮棉百斤的县，生产建设兵团的五个亩产皮棉百斤团（场），全区亩产百斤皮棉的面积，已达三十多万亩。在大面积丰产运动中，全区各地涌现出许多植棉能手。例如新疆生产建设兵团的刘学佛、薛占春同志，分别以亩产籽棉一千三百九十二斤和一千六百八十六斤创造了1955、1956年全国棉花高产纪录。又如1958年徐海甲、薛明哲两同志又创造了亩产籽棉三千六百七十七点一三斤的高产纪录。吐鲁番棉花试验站创造了长绒棉亩产籽棉七百八十二斤的高产纪录。这些棉花生产战线上的红旗，鼓舞和提高了广大群众对棉花丰产的信心，大大地推动了棉花生产的高额丰收运动。
    新疆地区棉花生产的高速度发展，是改造自然、改造思想相结合斗争的结果。在原来植棉基础薄弱的情况下，我们广泛深入地发动群众，有计划有步骤的实行治碱、倒茬、增施有机质肥料等办法培植提高老棉田；用开荒、轮作等办法来扩大新棉田，变广阔的戈壁为良好的植棉基地；营造棉田林带，在棉田周围种植高粱作物，防止风沙袭击；采取防重于治、治早、治少、治了的原则和人工防治为主，药械防治为辅的办法，防治了各种病虫害的危害。这一些措施保证棉田面积不断扩大，棉花产量不断获得丰产。这些事实使广大干部和群众树立了“人定胜天”的雄心大志，为今后棉花生产持续跃进奠定了巩固的思想基础。
        大搞技术革新
    大力发展棉花生产，必须大搞技术革新和技术革命的群众运动。在这个运动中，我们抓住了改革植棉工具这一环，因为这是植棉技术改革的中心内容。解放前，新疆地区棉花的播种、中耕，完全依靠落后的手工工具操作，解放后不断地加以改进，目前自治区部分地区已实现了植棉机械化，大部分地区做到了半机械化操作，大大地提高了劳动工效，缩短了棉花播种期，保证了棉花的种植质量，从根本上改变了历史上撒播、稀植、浅耕、不施肥等耕作粗放的落后状态。自治区各棉区广泛实行了适时早播、条播和合理密植，部分地区还推行了方窝播和横向间苗等先进技术措施；根据不同气候、土壤和棉苗生长的情况，采取了施足底肥、分期合理施追肥，以及恰当地使用氮、磷、钾肥；提倡经济用水，推行横灌和浸润灌溉；间苗、定苗、中耕、整枝、打尖等一系列的田间管理工作，已形成了比较完整的科学制度。广大干部和群众在植棉的生产实践中，通过现场参观评比，推广先进经验，开展先进和落后的思想斗争，继续不断地掀起了学先进、比先进、赶先进的改进棉花生产技术的群众运动，从而不断地出现了棉田大面积和高额丰产的事迹，有力地推动了全疆棉花生产的高速度发展。
        实现了良种化
    大力进行棉花品种改良，是提高棉花产量和质量的既经济又有效的措施。解放前，新疆棉种全是土种，产量低、质量差；解放后，党和政府十分重视棉花品种的改良和普及工作，把引进外来良种和培育本地良种结合起来，把专业棉花良种繁育试验和群众的种子田结合起来，把繁育与推广结合起来，并在全区开展了良种繁育的群众运动，建立了各级种子管理机构，因时因地制宜地繁育和推广各种优良品种，使自治区的植棉地区全部实现了良种化。实践证明，选育和推广适应性强，抗灾能力强，产量高的优良品种，就能获得高产。培育和普及一个新的优良品种，需要经过较长的时间，这就必须注意保持良种的纯洁性，防止良种杂交退化；任何一种新的良种，由于受自然环境和人工栽培的不良影响，经过一定时间，必然要退化；因此必须经常地、不断地培育新的良种，适应棉花生产不断发展的需要。
  作好植棉准备，力争高产
    为了适应社会主义建设的需要，我们今年将继续扩大植棉面积和提高单位面积产量，争取今年总产量比1959年增长40％左右；其中长绒棉面积将扩大六倍以上，亩产量将提高20％左右。这是我们棉花生产战线上极其艰巨而光荣的任务。为了充分发挥棉花的增产潜力，我们仍然要坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，想尽一切办法改革植棉技术。
    棉花播种期已经临近了，我们必须加速完成宜棉土地的选择，精选、调运良种、备足棉田底肥、整修植棉工具等一系列的准备工作，以便适时投入植棉战斗。要充分发挥机械和马拉农具的效能，合理安排劳力畜力，提高植棉工效，改革植棉技术，保证出苗齐全旺盛，打下棉花丰产的可靠基础。
    要实现棉花的丰产丰收，必须过好保苗、保蕾、保铃三关。保苗是棉花增产的基础；保证苗全苗旺，严防自然灾害袭击，以促进幼苗茁壮成长；要防止蕾铃脱落就必须过好施肥、灌水、中耕、整枝、打尖等一系列的技术关，并有效地控制棉花生长，集中养分保证多座伏前铃，减少蕾铃脱落，促使棉花早熟，争取优质高产。
  开展亩产千斤籽棉运动
    新疆今年将开展棉花丰产竞赛和亩产籽棉千斤的运动，要在社、队、场树立棉花生产战线上的红旗、标兵，以树立广大干部和群众实现更大高额丰产的信心。全区今年将大搞棉花丰产方，使大面积丰产田达到棉田总面积的20％左右，以带动全面棉花丰产运动。县与县、社与社、队与队之间季节性的参观评比和年终总评的持久竞赛必须进行，同时要总结推广先进植棉经验，帮助落后社、队赶上先进，克服棉花生产水平高低悬殊状态，实现棉花全面增产。新疆地区的棉花生产技术在两年来的大跃进中有很大提高。但是，目前棉花生产技术仍远落后于大跃进客观形势的需要。因此，必须大力发动群众，把技术革新和技术革命运动推向新的阶段。
