Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 5th - The Soviet government warned in a note to the West German government on the 4th that the steps taken by the West German government to establish bases for the Federal Defence Forces on foreign territory and to establish military cooperation with Franco's Spain would have extremely serious consequences, and that doing so was inconsistent with the interests of maintaining European peace and relevant international agreements concerning Germany. The note emphasized that the foreign policy steps taken by the West German government gave every reason to believe that it was afraid of eliminating the "Cold War" and afraid that efforts being made would lead to an agreement between the major powers on the most mature and pressing international issues. The note said that the obvious purpose of the conspiracy between Spain and West Germany was to cause friction between the participants in the East-West negotiations, attempting to lay landmines for the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee and create difficulties for the summit conference. The negotiations between the West German government and Franco's Spain once again proved that the West German government actually does not want the European situation to improve. For this reason, it opposes eliminating the aftermath of World War II and concluding a peace treaty with Germany, and therefore also opposes resolving other national tasks of the German people. The note said that the step taken by the West German government to establish military bases for the Federal Defence Forces on the territory of Franco's Spain has aroused great indignation and concern among people from all walks of life and parliaments in many countries, including countries belonging to the same military group as West Germany. It must be pointed out that the West German government cannot fail to be aware of this.

The Soviet government reminded the West German government that West Germany's military collusion with the Franco regime grossly violated the German Instrument of Unconditional Surrender and the agreements on the Allies regarding Germany. The agreement stipulated that Germany must never again threaten its neighbors and world peace. The note pointed out that, as everyone knows, the West German government has not only started on this dangerous path today, which is the path of violating international agreements stipulating the peaceful and democratic development of Germany. At present, West Germany is arming its troops with rocket weapons capable of being fitted with nuclear warheads, and is training its troops to use nuclear weapons. West German military institutions have formulated plans to establish a navy equipped with nuclear weapons and rocket weapons. Members of the Federal Defence Forces are being educated in revanchism and inciting hatred and hostility, especially hatred and hostility towards Germany's eastern neighbors. Soldiers and officers of the Federal Defence Forces are being instilled with the idea that the West German armed forces have a special mission to the Eastern European countries.

The note said that the nature of the agreement being planned between West Germany and Franco's Spain shows that West Germany's armament has entered a stage where this armament has exceeded the scope of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European Union; the West German government is even attempting to get rid of the incomplete clauses on the supervision of West German armament mentioned by the drafters of the Paris Agreement. The note added that West German officials attempted to justify the measures they took by citing the fact that West German territory could not meet the needs of further carrying out war preparations, and by citing the security interests of the Federal Republic. If this strange logic is followed, then it can be concluded that countries smaller than the Federal Republic of Germany should also establish their own military bases on the territory of other countries.

    苏联政府照会西德政府
    指出西德在外国建立军事基地同维护欧洲
    和平的利益和有关德国的国际协定不相符合
    据新华社莫斯科5日电　苏联政府4日在给西德政府的一份照会中警告说，西德政府所采取的在外国领土上建立联邦国防军基地和同佛朗哥西班牙建立军事合作的步骤有极其严重的后果，这样做同维护欧洲和平的利益和有关德国的国际协定是不相符合的。照会强调指出，西德政府所采取的对外政策的步骤使人有一切理由认为，它害怕消除“冷战”，害怕人们作出的努力会导致各大国之间就最成熟的和最迫切的国际问题达成协议。照会说，西班牙和西德的阴谋的明显的目的是想引起东西方谈判参加国之间的摩擦，企图给十国裁军委员会埋下地雷、给最高级会议造成困难。西德政府和佛朗哥西班牙的谈判再次证明，西德政府实际上不希望欧洲局势健康化。正因为如此，它反对消除第二次世界大战的后患和缔结对德和约，因而也反对解决德国人民的其他民族任务。照会说，西德政府想在佛朗哥西班牙的领土上建立联邦国防军军事基地的步骤激起了许多国家（其中包括与西德同属于一个军事集团的国家）的各界人士和议会的极大愤慨和忧虑。必须指出，西德政府不能没有觉察到这一点。
    苏联政府提醒西德政府注意，西德同佛朗哥政权进行军事勾结粗暴地破坏了德国无条件投降书以及关于盟国对德国的协定。协定规定保证德国永远不能再来威胁它的邻国和世界和平。照会指出，大家知道，西德政府不是从今天才开始走上这条危险的道路，即破坏规定德国和平民主发展的国际协定的道路的。目前，西德正在用能够按装核弹头的火箭武器武装它的军队，正在训练它的军队使用核武器。西德军事机构拟定了建立装备有核武器和火箭武器的海军的计划。联邦国防军的成员正受着复仇主义和挑起仇恨与敌视的教育，特别是对德国的东方邻国仇恨和敌视的教育。联邦国防军的士兵和军官正被灌输着一种西德武装力量对东欧国家负有特殊使命的思想。
    照会说，西德和佛朗哥西班牙正在策划中的协议的性质表明，西德的武装已经进入了这样一个阶段：这种武装已经超出了北大西洋公约组织和西欧联盟的范围；西德政府甚至企图摆脱巴黎协定起草人所提到的关于对西德武装进行监督的不彻底的条款。照会又说，西德官方人士企图借口西德领土不能满足进一步开展备战活动的需要，和借口联邦共和国的安全利益来为他们所采取的措施狡辩。如果按照这种奇怪的逻辑，那么就可以得出这样的结论：比德意志联邦共和国领土更小的国家，也都应当在别国的领土上建立自己的军事基地。
