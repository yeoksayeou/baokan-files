Xinhua News Agency, March 20th: As the movement to support drought resistance deepens in the national mechanical industry sector, the pace of production of irrigation and drainage machinery has accelerated significantly recently. According to preliminary statistics up to the beginning of March, the country has already produced 740,000 horsepower of various irrigation and drainage power machinery and more than 30,000 agricultural water pumps this year. Of this total, more than 260,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery was produced between February 20th and March 10th alone.

Since late February, under the leadership of local Party committees, mechanical industry departments in various regions have established specialized agencies from top to bottom to support the agricultural drought resistance struggle, strengthening specific leadership over the production and repair of irrigation and drainage machinery and other drought resistance tools. The broad masses of workers have regarded supporting rural drought resistance as their glorious political task, actively making guarantees, formulating measures, and doing everything possible to increase the production of irrigation and drainage machinery and water lifting tools. Friendly competitions of mutual support and collaboration have been widely carried out among factories, greatly accelerating the pace of production. To date, Guangdong, Fujian, Sichuan, Henan and other provinces have successively completed their first-quarter irrigation and drainage machinery manufacturing tasks ahead of schedule. Sichuan Province originally planned to produce only 15,700 horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery in the first quarter of this year, but by the beginning of March it had already produced 32,000 horsepower, more than double the original plan. Now, the workers in this province are advancing victoriously, striving to increase the production of more than 8,000 horsepower of internal combustion engines before the end of March.

Mechanical industry departments in various regions have also dispatched large numbers of technical workers to the countryside to help commune members in the front lines of drought resistance repair various agricultural machinery. In Hebei and Henan provinces alone, there are currently 160,000 workers carrying tools and spare parts, going deep into riverbanks and well sides to help farmers repair tools. A mobile repair group composed of more than 3,000 mechanical workers in Shou Zhang County, Shandong Province, repairs agricultural tools in rural areas, achieving "major repairs not overnight, medium repairs not after midday, and minor repairs not after the hour." In two days, they repaired more than 6,000 pieces of water lifting tools and more than 20,000 pieces of other transportation tools. Commune members said with satisfaction: "The working class is powerful, they repair whatever the farmers need. It is only because the Communist Party leads well that workers and peasants are truly one family."

Mechanical industry departments in various regions have further strengthened their ties with the countryside. Many mechanical factories in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang and other provinces and regions have established fixed ties with people's communes in supporting drought resistance. In addition to focusing on helping people's communes repair drought resistance tools, they also teach technology to farmers and help communes establish repair networks.

In some places, technical workers in factories have been combined with skilled craftsmen in rural areas to summarize and promote the successful experience of farmers in tool reform, and to manufacture a large number of new agricultural tools according to the needs of farmers, thereby effectively promoting the technological transformation of agriculture.

    全国机械工业职工满怀热情支援抗旱
    排灌机械生产进度加快
    据新华社20日讯　随着全国机械工业部门支援抗旱运动深入发展，最近各地生产排灌机械的进度极快。根据到3月上旬的初步统计，今年全国已生产出各种排灌动力机械七十四万马力，农用水泵三万多台。其中，只是2月20日到3月10日，各地生产的排灌机械就有二十六万多马力。
    2月下旬以来，各地机械工业部门在当地党委的领导下，都自上而下地成立了支援农业抗旱斗争的专门机构，加强了对排灌机械及其他抗旱工具的生产和修配工作的具体领导。广大职工更把支援农村抗旱作为自己光荣的政治任务，纷纷提保证，订措施，千方百计增产排灌机械和提水工具。各厂之间广泛开展了互相支援、互相协作的友谊竞赛，因而大大加快了生产进度。到目前为止，全国已有广东、福建、四川、河南等省先后提前完成了第一季度的排灌机械制造任务。四川省今年第一季原计划只生产一万五千七百马力的排灌机械，到3月上旬止已生产了三万二千马力，超过原计划一倍以上。现在，这个省的职工正在乘胜前进，争取在3月底以前再增产内燃机八千多马力。
    各地机械工业部门还派遣大批技术工人下乡，到抗旱前线帮助人民公社社员修配各种农业机械。仅河北、河南两省，目前就有十六万工人携带工具配件，深入河边、井旁，帮助农民检修工具。山东省寿张县由三千多名机械工人组成的流动修配组，在农村检修农具时做到“大修不过夜，中修不过晌，小修不过时”，在两天之内就修好了提水工具六千多件，其他运输等工具两万多件，社员们满意地说：“工人阶级力量大，农民要啥就修啥。只因共产党领导好，工农真正是一家。”
    各地机械工业部门进一步密切了同农村的联系。河北、山东、河南、江苏、辽宁、吉林、黑龙江等省区的许多机械工厂，都在支援抗旱中同人民公社建立了固定的联系。他们除开重点地帮助人民公社修配抗旱工具以外，还把技术教给农民，帮助公社建立修配网。
    有的地方还使各厂的技术工人同农村中的能工巧匠结合起来，总结推广农民在工具改革中的成功经验，并且根据农民的需要大量制造新式农具，因而有效地推动了农业的技术改造。
