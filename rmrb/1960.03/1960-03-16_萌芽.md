    The entire earth awakens in the spring breeze. Countless dormant seeds, nourished by the moisture in the soil, have their seed coats, which protect against external harm, soften. The seeds swell up completely, like a stage with the scenery set, just waiting for the opening gong and drum. At this time, with the addition of a suitable ground temperature for incubation, and a sufficient supply of air, the embryo, which is the soul of the seed, begins to become active. The other parts of the seed quickly transport a large amount of nutrients to serve as construction materials and energy for growth. A series of life activities, such as absorption, respiration, transformation, transportation, assimilation, and transpiration, begin within the tiny seed. A plant begins to grow in this way. Another guest has joined the grand gathering of nature.
    The appearance of this guest is inseparable from water, temperature, and air.
    Water is the most important participating substance in seed germination. Without water, there is no life, and therefore no seed germination. Too little water is also not good. Seeds stored in warehouses, if they contain only around 10% to 15% moisture, cannot germinate. The water absorption requirements of seeds during germination vary. Seeds with high fat content absorb less water, such as peanuts; seeds with high starch content generally absorb a moderate amount, such as corn; while seeds with high protein content often require a larger amount of water when germinating. For example, peas can absorb 120% to 150% of their own weight in water when germinating. In ancient times, some Taoists buried stone statues of deities together with bean seeds in the soil, using the force of the beans absorbing water and expanding to lift the stone statues, creating a false mystery to attract pious men and women. In 17th-century Western Europe, there were also records of the expansive force of seeds. Later, this gentle, uniform, and enormous force was used to pry open skulls that were difficult to separate properly with mechanical force, thus providing great convenience for anatomists.
    The temperature for incubating seed germination also varies depending on the plant. Many plants native to the north generally germinate at lower temperatures. Such as carrots and peas, which can germinate slightly above zero degrees Celsius, while plants whose native home is in the tropics, such as watermelons and cotton, require temperatures of twelve to fifteen degrees Celsius or higher to germinate. Almost all plants germinate faster at temperatures around twenty-five to thirty degrees Celsius, which provides an extremely convenient prerequisite for seedling cultivation.
    Like general higher plants, seeds breathe after absorbing enough water at a suitable temperature. Therefore, many seeds immersed in water or deposited deep in the soil often fail to germinate due to lack of air. Even some aquatic plants rely on a small amount of air hidden in the seed coat (such as rice) or on oxygen dissolved in the water (such as lotus seeds). If you peel off the outer shell of rice or put lotus seeds in cooled boiling water, they will not germinate due to the loss of air.
    Therefore, water, temperature, and air are the most basic conditions for plant seed germination, and none can be lacking.

    萌芽
    朱米
    整个大地在春风中苏醒过来，无数沉睡的种子，在土壤水分的滋润下，抵御外来侵害的种皮变柔软了，种子全胀了起来，像是一个搭开布景的舞台，只等开场的锣鼓了。这时候加上适当的地温孵化，如那供应充足的空气，作为种子灵魂的胚开始活动了。种子内其它部分赶快运来许多养分，以作为生长的建设原料与能源。小小的种子内就开始了吸收、呼吸、转化、运输、同化、蒸腾等一系列的生命活动。一株植物就这么开始成长了。大自然的盛会上又多了一位宾客。
    这位宾客的出现是与水、温度和空气分不开的。
    水，是种子萌芽的最重要参与物质。没有水就没有生命，也就没有种子的萌芽。水少了也不行，那些堆积在仓库里的种子，如果只含有10％—15％上下的水分，就不能萌发。种子萌芽时吸收水分的要求是不同的，含脂肪多的种子吸水较少，如花生；含淀粉多的种子一般居中，如玉米；而含蛋白质多的种子在萌动时常常需要较多量的水。例如豌豆在萌动时可吸收相当于自重的120％—150％的水。在古代曾经有过一些道士们把石雕神像与豆类种子一并埋在土中，利用豆子吸水膨胀的力量把石像顶起而故弄玄虚，以招徕善男信女。在十七世纪的西欧，也有人记载了种子膨胀的力量，后来就利用这个和缓、均匀而巨大的力量，来撑开那些用机械力量难以妥善分开的头盖骨，从而为解剖学家提供了极大的方便。
    孵化种子萌芽的温度，不同的植物要求也不同。许多北方原产的植物，一般在较低的温度下就可以萌芽。如胡萝卜、豌豆之类，稍高于零度就可以，而那些故乡在热带的植物，如西瓜、棉花等就要在摄氏十二——十五度以上或更高一些才能发芽。几乎全部的植物在摄氏二十五——三十度上下时发芽都比较快，这就给育苗工作提供了极其便利的前提。
    种子与一般高等植物一样，吸足了水之后，在适当的温度下就要呼吸。因而许多浸在水中或沉积在土壤深处的种子，经常是由于缺少空气而不能萌发。就是一些水生植物，有的是靠种子外壳里藏着的一点空气（如水稻），有的是靠溶解在水中的氧（如莲子）。如果剥去稻子的外壳或把莲子放在冷却的开水中，都会因失去空气而不能萌发。
    所以说水、温度和空气，是植物种子萌芽时最基本的条件，缺一不可。
