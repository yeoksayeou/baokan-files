Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 21st: Cuban President Dorticos said at a mass rally held at the Havana Sports City on the evening of March 20th, "Cuba will buy the weapons and planes we need from any country that sells them, because the power to buy and sell belongs entirely to the revolutionary government and does not require outside instructions." His speech was warmly applauded by the thousands of people who attended the rally.

Sports City is where war criminals were tried at this time last year. At this mass rally, the Cuban "Twelfth" Road Television Broadcasting Station and other radio stations handed over 250,000 pesos in donations they had raised in Havana in two weeks to President Dorticos for the purchase of weapons and planes needed to defend national sovereignty and resist foreign aggression.

Dorticos said: The conspiracy to make Cuba yield through hunger and prevent Cuba's development is intensifying, but those who dream of using this strategy to make Cuba submit forget that before being starved to death, the Cuban people are determined to fight and die in the trenches of the revolution. Dorticos said: Every house and every building in the city will become a trench defended by workers and students. Every tree and every hill will become an impregnable fortress of the revolution.

The Cuban president also strongly condemned at the conference the shameless statement by the Inter-American Press Association, led by Dubois, an American spy who was expelled from Cuba, which slandered Cuba. At a meeting held in Montego Bay, Jamaica, on the 20th, the association slandered Cuba for "undermining press freedom" and compared Cuba to the U.S.-backed Dominican and Nicaraguan dictatorial regimes.

Dorticos said that the Inter-American Press Association does not represent journalists of the Americas, but serves the counter-revolutionary and reactionary interests of monopoly groups. He exposed the mask of so-called freedom of the press and speech in the United States. He asked: What kind of freedom is it that conceals from the American people the bloody strangulation of the Guatemalan revolution by American monopoly groups? What freedom of speech and the press is it that conceals the bombs made in their country being used to massacre the Cuban people, and now trying to portray the traitor Diaz Lanz as a hero? What freedom of speech and the press is it that conceals from their people the planes burning Cuba's sugar cane fields every day, attempting to destroy our factories, and filling the Cuban people with terror? Dorticos said that if this is the freedom of the press claimed by the Inter-American Press Association, then they must always remember that the Cuban government and the Cuban people will never want this kind of freedom! What we want is the freedom to expound the truth.

Dorticos concluded by saying that propaganda and conspiracy are nothing great. As long as we have the fighting consciousness and the will to strive for freedom and independence of our people, we will be sufficient to oppose this propaganda and these conspiracies.

The president's speech was repeatedly interrupted by stormy applause and cheers from the crowd, who expressed their enthusiastic support for the president's speech.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 21st: Cuban public opinion angrily condemns the recent series of new acts of aggression against Cuba by the United States and the threatening remarks made by U.S. Secretary of State Herter.

"Hoy" pointed out in an editorial that it was precisely when Cuba demanded that the United States hand over the Cuban war criminal Pedraza that this light aircraft from the United States, piloted by two American pilots, attempted to transport Batista elements to the United States. This incident once again proves that the main enemy of the Cuban revolution is U.S. imperialism.

The Executive Committee of the Cuban Workers' Confederation issued a statement protesting the aggression against Cuba carried out by some American aircraft on the 20th. The statement pointed out that the new acts of aggression against Cuba by aircraft based in U.S. territory occurred precisely when Eisenhower announced that the U.S. government "sincerely hopes to maintain traditional friendship with the Cuban government." These new attacks on Cuba completely exposed the deceptive nature of Eisenhower's statement.

U.S. Secretary of State Herter's nakedly threatening remarks against Cuba on television on the 20th aroused strong protests from Havana newspapers. "Calle" published an editorial entitled "Mr. Herter伸伸伸出魔爪," pointing out that Herter has revealed the hideous face hidden behind the mask. But Herter has not frightened us in the past. Now that we see through his tricks, let alone now.

Xinhua News Agency, Caracas, March 21st: One thousand members of the Venezuelan Communist Youth League have volunteered to fight to defend revolutionary Cuba.

Opposing U.S. aggression, resolutely supporting the Cuban government headed by Fidel Castro, and launching a broad movement to support Cuba are among the most important resolutions made by the Ninth Central Committee Plenary Session of the Venezuelan Communist Youth League, which closed in Caracas yesterday. The Central Plenary Session of the Communist Youth League also decided to oppose the authorities' pardoning of soldiers who participated in the anti-democratic conspiracy on September 7, 1958.

The Central Plenary Session analyzed the current domestic situation and its prospects, and decided on the current organizational tasks of the Communist Youth League.

Today, Colombian expatriates in Caracas marched in front of the statue of Cuban hero José Martí, expressing their support for the Cuban revolution and protesting against U.S. imperialist interference in Cuban and Latin American affairs. (Attached picture)

### 多尔蒂科斯总统在哈瓦那群众大会上说  古巴人民决不向美帝国主义屈服  委内瑞拉一千名共青盟员志愿为保卫古巴革命而战斗

    多尔蒂科斯总统在哈瓦那群众大会上说
    古巴人民决不向美帝国主义屈服
    委内瑞拉一千名共青盟员志愿为保卫古巴革命而战斗
    据新华社哈瓦那21日电　古巴总统多尔蒂科斯20日晚在哈瓦那体育城举行的群众大会上说，“古巴将向任何出售武器的国家购买我们所需要的武器和飞机，因为买卖的权力完全属于革命政府，不需要外来的指示。”他的讲话受到了参加大会的几千人的热烈鼓掌欢迎。
    体育城就是去年此时审判战犯的地方。在这次群众大会上，古巴第“十二”路电视广播电台和其他广播电台把他们在两星期内在哈瓦那募集的二十五万比索捐款交给多尔蒂科斯总统，作为购买保卫国家主权和反对外国侵略所需要的武器和飞机之用。
    多尔蒂科斯说：企图以饥饿使古巴屈服和阻止古巴发展的阴谋日益加剧，但是梦想以这种战略来使古巴屈服的人忘记了，在被饥饿困死以前，古巴人民决心在革命的战壕里战斗而死。多尔蒂科斯说：城市里的每所住房、每幢大楼都将成为工人和学生保卫的战壕。每一棵树、每一个山岗都将成为革命的不可攻破的堡垒。
    古巴总统还在这次大会上严厉谴责由被古巴驱逐出境的美国间谍杜博伊斯领导的泛美报业协会诬蔑古巴的无耻声明。这个协会在20日在牙买加蒙特哥湾举行的一次会议上诬蔑古巴“破坏新闻自由”，并且拿古巴同美国豢养的多米尼加和尼加拉瓜独裁政权相提并论。
    多尔蒂科斯说，泛美报业协会并不代表美洲大陆的新闻工作者，而是服从于垄断集团的反革命和反动的利益的。他揭露了美国的所谓新闻和言论自由的假面具。他问道：向美国人民掩饰美国垄断集团血腥地扼杀危地马拉革命的是哪一种自由？掩盖在他们国家里制造的炸弹被用来屠杀古巴人民，现在又企图把叛徒迪亚斯·兰斯扮成英雄的是什么言论和新闻自由呢？向他们的人民掩饰飞机每天在焚烧古巴的甘蔗园，企图毁坏我国的工厂，使古巴人民充满恐怖的是什么言论和新闻自由呢？多尔蒂科斯说，假如这就是泛美报业协会所宣称的新闻自由，那么他们要永远记住，古巴政府和古巴人民绝不要这种自由！我们所要的是阐述真理的自由。
    多尔蒂科斯最后说，宣传和阴谋没有什么了不起。只要有我国人民的战斗觉悟和争取自由独立的意志，我们就足以反对这些宣传和阴谋了。
    总统的讲话不时为群众暴风雨般的掌声和欢呼所打断，群众以此表示他们对总统讲话的热烈支持。
    据新华社哈瓦那21日电　古巴舆论愤怒地谴责美国最近对古巴进行的一系列新的侵略活动和美国国务卿赫脱最近发表的威胁古巴的谈话。
    “今日报”在社论里指出，恰恰是在古巴要求美国交出古巴战犯佩德拉萨的时候，这架由两个美国驾驶员驾驶的来自美国的轻型飞机却企图把巴蒂斯塔分子运往美国。这件事再次证明，古巴革命的主要敌人是美帝国主义。
    古巴工人联合会执行委员会发表声明，抗议一些美国飞机在20日对古巴进行的侵略活动。声明指出，以美国领土为基地的飞机对古巴进行的新的侵略活动正好发生在艾森豪威尔宣布美国政府“真诚地希望保持同古巴政府的传统友谊”的时候。这些对古巴的新进攻完全揭穿了艾森豪威尔声明的欺骗性质。
    美国国务卿赫脱20日在电视中发表的赤裸裸威胁古巴的谈话激起哈瓦那报界的强烈抗议。“街道报”以“赫脱先生伸出魔爪”为题发表社论指出，赫脱已经露出了藏在假面具后面的狰狞面目。但是，赫脱过去没有吓倒我们。现在，当我们看穿他的把戏的时候，就更不用说了。
    新华社加拉加斯21日电　一千名委内瑞拉共产主义青年联盟盟员已经提出志愿为保卫革命的古巴而战斗。
    反对美国侵略、坚决支持以菲德尔·卡斯特罗为首的古巴政府并为此展开支持古巴的广泛运动，这是昨天在加拉加斯闭幕的委内瑞拉共产主义青年联盟第九次中央委员会全会作出的最重要的决议之一。共产主义青年联盟中央全会还决定反对当局宽恕参与1958年9月7日反民主阴谋的军人。
    中央全会分析了目前的国内形势及其前景，决定了共产主义青年联盟当前的组织任务。
    今天，加拉加斯的哥伦比亚侨民在古巴英雄何塞·马蒂像前游行，表示支持古巴革命，抗议美帝国主义干涉古巴和拉丁美洲的事务。（附图片）
    ——来干什么！
