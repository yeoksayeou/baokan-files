    Establishing Production Links, Jointly Undertaking Construction
    Soviet Collective Farms Expand Inter-Farm Cooperation

    (By our correspondent) Moscow - Collective farm cooperation in the Soviet Union has recently seen widespread development. Currently, collective farms in many regions are uniting to engage in construction projects for common needs, such as building power stations, irrigation systems, agricultural product processing plants, building materials factories, highways, schools, hospitals, and sanatoriums. In the Krasnodar Krai's fifty-two districts alone, thirty-two already have joint collective farm organizations, and fifteen of these thirty-two districts have inter-farm construction organizations. The entire krai has also established a regional inter-farm construction company, which engages in procuring and producing building materials.

    Inter-farm production links have been widely developed in Ukraine. In this republic, over one thousand types of inter-farm organizations and enterprises have been established, with approximately 85% of collective farms participating in these organizations and enterprises. These institutions completed construction projects worth nearly one billion rubles last year alone.

    Collective farms in the Uzbek Republic have also jointly undertaken a substantial amount of construction work. In the last three years, the republic's collective farms have collectively built and renovated over 2,500 kilometers of highways. During the Seven-Year Plan period, collective farms in the Uzbek Republic plan to invest approximately 4 billion rubles in water conservancy, soil improvement, road construction, and pasture development. They also plan to invest approximately 9 billion rubles in electrification and the construction of boarding schools, hospitals, maternity wards, canteens, bakeries, and residential and production buildings for collective farm members. To achieve this goal, inter-farm construction organizations and inter-farm enterprises producing building materials, such as cement factories and factories producing prefabricated reinforced concrete components, are being established in various regions of the republic.

    Production links among collective farms in the Georgian Republic have also greatly developed. Collective farms in the republic have jointly established numerous construction organizations, pig farms, livestock fattening farms, bus stations, and other institutions. Collective farms have also jointly invested in building roads, bridges, boarding schools, hospitals, and power stations. In the Belorussian Republic, three thousand six hundred collective farms have participated in joint organizations, constructing hundreds of industrial enterprises, mainly processing plants and materials factories.

    The scope of collective farm cooperation is also expanding. For example, the Leningrad Oblast has established over thirty inter-farm enterprises to extract peat for use as fertilizer. In the Krasnoyarsk Krai, collective farms in seven districts have even jointly built a collective farm grand theater.

    The strengthening of inter-farm cooperation among Soviet collective farms plays a significant role in raising the cultural and living standards of the Soviet countryside.

    建立生产联系　共同从事建设
    苏联集体农庄扩大庄际合作
    本报讯　苏联集体农庄之间的合作，近来得到了广泛的发展。目前，许多地区的集体农庄联合起来从事共同需要的建设事业，如修建发电站、灌溉系统、农产品加工厂、建筑材料厂、公路、学校、医院和疗养院等。仅在克拉斯诺达尔边疆区的五十二个区中，就有三十二个区已经有了集体农庄的联合机构，在这三十二个区中有十五个庄际建筑组织。在全边疆区还成立了边区庄际建筑公司，从事采办和生产建筑材料。
    庄际生产联系在乌克兰得到了广泛的发展。在这个共和国，成立了一千多种庄际组织和企业，大约有85％的集体农庄都参加了这些组织和企业。这些机构仅在去年就完成了开支将近十亿卢布的建筑工程。
    乌兹别克共和国的集体农庄也共同进行了大量的建设性的工作。最近三年内，共和国的集体农庄合力修建和改建了二千五百余公里的公路。在七年计划期间，乌兹别克共和国的集体农庄打算在兴修水利、改良土壤、建设道路以及开辟牧场等方面投资约四十亿卢布。在电气化和建设寄宿学校、医院、产院、食堂、面包房和庄员的住宅和生产建筑等方面，投资约九十亿卢布。为了达到这个目的，在共和国的各地区正在建立庄际建筑组织和生产建筑材料的庄际企业，如水泥工厂，生产钢筋混凝土装配式构件的工厂等。
    格鲁吉亚共和国集体农庄之间的生产联系同样得到很大的发展。共和国的集体农庄共同建立了许多建筑机构、养猪场、牲畜育肥场、汽车站和其它机构。集体农庄还合资修建道路、桥梁、寄宿学校、医院和发电站。在白俄罗斯共和国，有三千六百个集体农庄参加了联合组织，修建了数百个工业企业，主要是加工厂和材料厂。
    集体农庄合作的范围也越来越广。例如，列宁格勒州建立了三十多个庄际企业，开采用来肥田的泥炭。而在克拉斯诺雅尔斯克边区，七个区的集体农庄还共同修建了一个农庄大剧院。
    苏联集体农庄庄际合作的加强，对于提高苏维埃农村的文化和生活水平方面有很大的作用。
