Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 26th: The "Russia" ship, sent by our country to Indonesia to bring back persecuted overseas Chinese, arrived at Huangpu Port on the 26th with more than 1,200侨胞 (compatriots), and was warmly welcomed by the people of Guangzhou.

As soon as the ship docked, the僑胞 (compatriots) excitedly raised large red banners that read "Motherland, dear mother, your overseas children have finally returned," and "We are determined to contribute our strength to the socialist construction of the motherland," and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao" as they stepped onto the soil of the motherland. The masses welcoming them at the dock applauded warmly. Among those welcoming them were Zhong Qingfa, Director of the Guangzhou Office of the Reception and Placement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China, and Director of the General Office of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission; Li Mei, member of the Reception and Placement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China; Cai Zhongchang, Standing Committee member of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, and leaders of the Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, who all warmly shook hands with the僑胞 (compatriots) to express their cordial greetings.

That evening, the Guangzhou Office of the Reception and Placement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese of the People's Republic of China held a welcome meeting in Guangzhou to welcome and comfort this group of returned overseas Chinese.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhanjiang, March 26th: On the morning of the 26th, another 500-plus僑胞 (compatriots) who had been persecuted in Indonesia returned to the motherland on the "Yakutia" ship, and were warmly welcomed by more than 1,000 people from all walks of life in Zhanjiang City.

This group of returned overseas Chinese mostly came from the West Java region of Indonesia. Before returning to China, they had been forcibly concentrated in the Galahang detention camp by powerful groups in Indonesia for more than three months.

At about 8 a.m. on the 26th, the僑胞 (compatriots) disembarked amidst the sound of gongs and drums. Many僑胞 (compatriots) could not contain their excitement and repeatedly said to those who came to welcome them: "Thank you, Chairman Mao." Qiu Yaling, a 71-year-old returned overseas Chinese, said with great emotion: "We can feel at ease now that we are back in the motherland."

After disembarking, the returned overseas Chinese immediately took a bus to the Overseas Chinese Guesthouse to rest.

Liu Yao, Vice Mayor of Zhanjiang City, and the heads of the Guangdong Province and Yunnan Province Reception and Placement Committee for Returned Overseas Chinese, who had come to Zhanjiang to welcome the returned overseas Chinese, were at the dock to welcome the returning僑胞 (compatriots).

Xinhua News Agency, Zhanjiang, March 27th: The ship "Fuan," sent by our government to Indonesia to bring back overseas Chinese, arrived at Zhanjiang Port on the morning of the 27th, and more than 200 returned overseas Chinese were warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life in Zhanjiang City. Thus far, the five ships sent by our government in the second batch to Indonesia to bring back overseas Chinese, namely the "Haihuang," "Dabaokang," "Russia," "Yakutia," and "Fuan," have successively and safely transported more than 3,000僑胞 (compatriots) back to the motherland. Including other liners, more than 5,000僑胞 (compatriots) have returned to the motherland from Indonesia in these ten days.
