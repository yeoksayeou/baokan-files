    Myriad Purples and Brilliant Reds

    The hallmark of our heroic era is the emergence of advanced individuals and advanced collectives. Advanced collectives, with tens of thousands of advanced producers and innovation experts as their backbone, are emerging every moment in every region and every department throughout the country. This is clear evidence of the leaping development of our socialist construction and a clear indication of the great enhancement of the ideological consciousness of our six hundred million people. Today, we are also pleased to see the news that Sichuan Province is striving to raise the agricultural production of all counties in the province to the level of advanced counties. The scope of pursuing and catching up with the advanced is not limited to a production team or a commune, but is expanding to the scope of a county, with unified action throughout the province.
    The emergence of this fact is naturally the result of the continuous great leap forward in production in the past two years, the result of the sound development of the people's communes, and also the further development of putting politics in command and launching mass movements in agricultural production. It is the result of the increasingly widespread and in-depth development of the competition movement of learning from, catching up with, surpassing, and helping each other among various collectives. In this way, hundreds of thousands or millions of people in a county, from all walks of life, are absorbed into the ranks of the competition, truly forming a nationwide mass competition movement. It reflects the people's urgent desire to improve production and reflects the objective law of the continuous rise and development of socialist production.
    This competition movement in Sichuan Province to strive to raise the agricultural production of all counties to the level of advanced counties has opened up infinitely broad prospects for the rapid development of agricultural production. Although the movement has just begun, it has already exerted tremendous power in this year's spring production. The spring production in various counties is advancing side by side, taking the initiative step by step, and is greatly improved compared with the same period last year. If all provinces in the country can pay attention to raising the level of agricultural production in the counties by one step, it will also greatly improve the level of national agricultural production. We hope that the buds of advanced counties can bloom all over the country, forming a scene of myriad purples and brilliant reds, making the first spring of our motherland in the 1960s particularly beautiful.

    我们的英雄时代的特色，是先进辈出，先进集体辈出。以千千万万先进生产者和革新能手为骨干的先进集体，每时每刻在全国各个地区、各个部门涌现，这是我们社会主义建设事业飞跃发展的明证，是六亿人民思想觉悟大大提高的明证。今天，我们又高兴地看到四川省力争将全省各县农业生产提高到先进县水平的消息。追先进、赶先进的范围不仅仅止于一个生产队、一个公社，而是扩大到县的范围，在全省内统一行动起来。
    这一事实的出现，自然是近两年来生产连续大跃进的结果，是人民公社健全发展的结果，也是政治挂帅，大搞群众运动在农业生产中的进一步发展，是各个集体之间学、赶、超、帮的竞赛运动开展得愈来愈广泛、愈来愈深入的结果。这样，便把一个县的几十万、上百万人口，各行各业的人都吸收进去，参加竞赛的行列，真正形成全党全民性的竞赛运动。它反映了人民群众迫切提高生产的愿望，反映了社会主义生产不断上升和发展的客观规律。
    四川省这个力争将各县的农业生产提高到先进县的水平的竞赛运动，为农业生产的飞速发展开辟了无限广阔的前景。运动虽然刚刚开始，便已经在今年春季生产中发挥出巨大的威力。各县的春季生产齐头并进，步步主动，比去年同期的生产大为提高。如果全国各省都能注意把县的农业生产水平都提高一步，也就在很大程度上提高了全国农业生产的水平。我们希望先进县的蓓蕾能开遍全国，形成万紫千红一片春色，将我们祖国六十年代的第一个春天打扮得分外美好。
