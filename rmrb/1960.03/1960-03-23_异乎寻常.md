Extraordinary

"Reform," "Change," "New"—these are the most common words we see in newspapers these days. Ideological reform, technical transformation, soil improvement, tool reform, changing dry land into paddy fields, poor land into good land, poor mountains into rich mountains, low yield into high yield, new development, new stage, new look, new atmosphere... It's not just "reform," but "major reform and special reform," "comprehensive reform, complete set reform"; it's not just "change," but "tremendous change," "rapid change"; it's not just "new," but from "changing with each passing day" to "changing with each passing moment." It is truly "daily renewal, and again daily renewal," with new things emerging one after another, and new forces striving unceasingly. The change and renewal of things are originally routine; however, the change is so fast, so big, and so much that people cannot help but feel "extraordinary." Such "extraordinary" things appear so many times that people feel that this is a new routine. This is the characteristic of our society and our era. We are in an era of great revolution, an era of great liberation of productive forces.

Spring plowing and production occur once a year. Is it the "same old stuff?" "Isn't it just plowing, delivering manure, sowing, and transplanting rice seedlings?" When reading the newspaper, if you think like this, and only look at the headlines when you see "dynamics" of spring plowing, then you are wrong. Spring plowing news must be read. Comrades in rural areas must read it, and comrades in cities must also read it. Look, how are hundreds of millions of farmers changing the mountains and rivers of the motherland with such spirit and energy, how are they opening up new horizons and creating new lives in the new stage of socialist construction!

The drought in Hubei Province last year was "extraordinary"; and the enthusiasm of the people of the province in this year's spring plowing production is also "extraordinary." Since last winter, in just a few months, the face of the entire rural Hubei has greatly changed: newly built water conservancy projects have increased the province's water storage capacity by about double the amount of water conservancy projects built since liberation; nearly ten million mu of newly reclaimed wasteland, approaching 15% of the original total cultivated area; more than nine million mu of dry land and sloping land have been turned into paddy fields and terraced fields; and garden-style farming has been realized on fourteen million mu of land. "Good enough," right? No! Newer scenes then appeared: breaking with convention, preparing for cultivation early, and all preparations for spring plowing and sowing were done a month earlier than in previous years, quickly and well. The province originally had fifteen million mu of "low-yield fields" and "backward land"; before long, two-thirds of them had been "greatly reformed" and "greatly changed," entering the ranks of the advanced. The cultivated land suddenly increased by ten million mu, the most advanced garden-style cultivated land increased to more than ten million mu, and another ten million mu of backward land caught up with the advanced; and the degree of intensive farming was also improving on other tens of millions of mu of land. This is truly a "world-shaking" great change. What force does such a great change rely on? It relies on the commune members led by the Party with a great revolutionary spirit, and on "major reform"—reforming ideology and reforming technology. Throughout the province, there are mass technical reform debates everywhere, and technical innovation and technical revolution movements centered on "four reforms and two eliminations" (reform of transportation, water lifting, cultivation, and processing tools, eliminate shoulder carrying and human-powered waterwheels)... Such a situation is certainly not unique to Hubei, and the situation in Hubei is a microcosm of the rural areas throughout the country.

Everything is changing, and everything is undergoing major reform and major change. Constant reform and constant change are the only way to stay new, and without reform and change, it will inevitably become old. New ideas promote new situations, and new situations promote new ideas; new situations promote new technologies, and new technologies promote new situations; innovation and then innovation, revolution and then revolution. "Extraordinary" things appear in the "ordinary," and the "extraordinary" becomes "ordinary" again, and new "extraordinary" things appear in the new "ordinary." The spring tide is surging and rolling forward. In the news of spring plowing in Hubei, we can see how high the spirit of continuous revolution of the people is. This is the endless power of great change and daily renewal.

    异乎寻常
    杨岭
    “改”、“变”、“新”，这些是当前我们在报纸上最常见的几个字。思想改造、技术改造、土壤改良、工具改革，旱地变水田、薄地变良田、穷山变富山、低产变高产，新发展、新阶段、新面貌、新气象……。不只是“改”，而且是“大改特改”“全面改，成套改”；不只是“变”，而且是“巨大变化”“飞速变化”；不只是“新”，而且从“日新月异”到“时新日异”。真是“日日新，又日新”，新鲜事物层出不穷，新生力量自强不息。事物的改变和更新，本来就是常规；可是，改变得如此之快、如此之大、如此之多，就使人不能不觉得“异乎寻常”。这种“异乎寻常”的事情出现得很多很多，以至于使人们感觉到这又是一种新的常规。——这就是我们这个社会、我们这个时代的特征。我们正处于一个大革命的时代，生产力大解放的时代。
    春耕生产，一年一度。“老一套”吧？“还不是犁地、送粪、播种、插秧？”看报的时候，如果这样想，一看是春耕“动态”就只看看大标题，那就错了。春耕消息不可不看。农村里的同志们不可不看，城市里的同志们也不可不看。看吧，几亿农民是在用怎样的气概、怎样的劲头在改变着祖国的山河，怎样在社会主义建设的新阶段开辟新天地、创造新生活！
    湖北省去年的干旱是“异乎寻常”；而全省人民今年春耕生产的干劲也是“异乎寻常”。去冬以来，只不过几个月的时间，整个湖北农村的面貌就大大改观：新建水利工程使全省的蓄水量比解放以来兴修水利工程蓄水量增加了大约一倍；新开垦的荒地近一千万亩，接近原有耕地总面积的15％；九百多万亩旱地、坡地变成了水地、梯田；在一千四百万亩土地上实现了园田化。“够好”了吧？不！更新的景象接着又出现了：打破常规，提早备耕，春耕播种的各项准备工作都比往年早了一个月光景，又快又好。全省原来有一千五百万亩“低产田”、“落后地”；不多时，其中的三分之二已经“大改”“大变”，进入先进行列。耕地一下子增加了一千万亩，最先进的园田化的耕地增加到一千多万亩，落后赶先进的又是一千多万亩；在别的几千万亩土地上，精耕细作的程度也都在提高。这真是“天翻地复”的大变化。这样的大变化，靠什么力量？靠党所领导的具有大革命精神的公社社员，靠“大改”——改思想、改技术。全省处处是全民性的技术改革大辩论，处处是以“四改两消灭”（改革运输、提水、耕作、加工工具，消灭肩担和人力车水）为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动……。这样的局面当然不是湖北特有的，湖北的情景正是全国农村的一个缩影。
    一切都在改变，一切都在大改大变。常改常变才能够常新，不改不变就必然陈旧。新思想推动新形势，新形势推动新思想；新形势推动新技术，新技术推动新形势；革新再革新，革命再革命。在“寻常”中出现“异乎寻常”，“异乎寻常”又变为“寻常”，在新的“寻常”中又出现新的“异乎寻常”。春潮澎湃，滚滚向前。在湖北春耕的消息中，可以看到人民群众的这种不断革命的精神是多么高涨。这就是大改大变、日新又新的无穷无尽的力量。
