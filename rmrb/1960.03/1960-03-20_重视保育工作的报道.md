    Report on Emphasizing Childcare Work
    Around "March 8th," the People's Daily published some reports and articles about childcare workers, reflecting how happily our children are growing up and how meticulously the caregivers care for them. This is not only a great encouragement and help to childcare workers, but also an inspiration to parents. I am a young woman and love reading these articles, but the People's Daily has published very few of them in the past. I request that the newspaper continue to report on childcare work regularly after "March 8th."　Hangzhou　Li Yingping

    重视保育工作的报道
    “三八”前后人民日报刊载了关于保育工作者的一些报道和文章，反映出我们的儿童生长在多么幸福的环境里，阿姨们怎样无微不至地关心他们。这不仅对保育工作者有很大的鼓舞和帮助，对做父母的也有所启发。我是一个青年妇女，十分爱读这些文章，只是人民日报过去发表得很少，要求报纸在“三八”以后对保育工作也能经常作些报道。　杭州　李影萍
