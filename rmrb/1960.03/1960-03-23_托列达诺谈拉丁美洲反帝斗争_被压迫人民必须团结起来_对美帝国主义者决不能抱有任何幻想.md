Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 21st: Lombardo Toledano, Secretary-General of the Latin American Labor Confederation, stated in an interview with the "Hoy" newspaper in Havana today, calling on the people of Latin American countries to unite and fight against their common enemy, U.S. imperialism.

Toledano said that the current "Week of Support for the People of Latin America" shows that the great movement for independence in colonial and semi-colonial countries is indivisible. At present, local struggles are unimaginable because the oppressed people must unite to achieve liberation. The struggle must be universal.

Toledano came to Havana to express the support of the Latin American labor movement for the "Week of Support for the People of Latin America." Toledano said that imperialism will lose its power; however, it is very clear that if we stop ourselves, we cannot destroy the enslavement of our people. He said that we cannot have illusions, because now there are only two camps: either to oppose imperialism headed by the United States, or to stand with this imperialism that starves our American countries. Toledano pointed out that everything that has happened in Cuba is part of what is happening in other countries in the Americas, Africa, and Southeast Asia. As in Cuba, the enemy there is also imperialism. Defeating imperialism in any country is support for the people of other countries. He said that we should strengthen brotherly friendship ties in order to fight together against imperialist aggressors.

Toledano stated that the Latin American labor movement firmly supports the Cuban revolution. He said that Cuba has become a model for countries in Latin America and many parts of the world. The Cuban revolutionary government is the progressive regime of this era, and therefore, the imperialists are attacking it in the name of "opposing communism."

Toledano emphasized that imperialism is right in front of us, and any weakness will lead to the failure of our people. It is imperialism that is invading us, and we are defending our most legitimate and humane interests.

Toledano pointed out that the aims of U.S. imperialism will not be achieved. He said that the example of Cuba clearly illustrates the problem. The fact now before everyone is that U.S. imperialism is an aggressor, and it opposes the Cuban people who are fighting for their sovereignty. He said that the people of Latin American countries are fully convinced that the Cuban revolution will defeat imperialist aggression and achieve victory, because the Cuban revolution has the full support of the Cuban people and the people of the entire Latin America and the world.

The leader of the Latin American labor movement suggested that all labor organizations in Latin America hold meetings under the condition of respecting the independence of each labor organization, in order to reach agreements on joint struggles and seek organizational unity. He said that this task will be completed in several stages: first, to fight for common goals, and the final stage will be to establish a new and powerful unified Latin American labor union.

### 托列达诺谈拉丁美洲反帝斗争  被压迫人民必须团结起来  对美帝国主义者决不能抱有任何幻想

    托列达诺谈拉丁美洲反帝斗争
    被压迫人民必须团结起来
    对美帝国主义者决不能抱有任何幻想
    新华社哈瓦那21日电　拉丁美洲劳工联盟总书记隆巴多·托列达诺今天在哈瓦那向“今日报”记者发表谈话时，号召拉丁美洲各国人民团结起来，为反对他们的共同敌人美帝国主义而斗争。
    托列达诺说，目前正在举行的“支援拉丁美洲人民周”表明，殖民地和半殖民地国家争取独立的伟大运动是不可分割的。目前，局部的斗争已经是不可想像的了，因为，被压迫的人民必须团结起来才能求得解放。斗争必须是普遍的。
    托列达诺来到哈瓦那，是为了表示拉丁美洲工人运动对“支援拉丁美洲人民周”的支持。托列达诺说，帝国主义将丧失它的势力；但是，非常明显，假如我们自己停顿下来，我们就不能摧毁对我们各国人民的奴役。他说，我们不能抱有幻想，因为现在只有两个营垒，如果不是反对以美国为首的帝国主义，就是同这个使我们美洲各国忍饥挨饿的帝国主义站在一起。托列达诺指出，在古巴所发生的一切是在美洲其他国家、非洲和东南亚国家正在发生的事情的一部分。同在古巴一样，那儿的敌人也是帝国主义。在任何国家里击溃帝国主义，就是对其他各国人民的支持。他说，我们应该加强兄弟般的友谊联系，以便为反对帝国主义侵略者而共同斗争。
    托列达诺表示，拉丁美洲的工人运动坚决支持古巴的革命。他说，古巴已经成为拉丁美洲各国和世界许多地方的典范。古巴革命政府是这个时代的进步政权，因此，帝国主义者以“反对共产主义”为名，对它进行攻击。
    托列达诺强调说，帝国主义就在我们的对面，任何软弱都会造成我们人民的失败。是帝国主义在侵略我们，而我们正在保卫我们的最正当的和最人道的利益。
    托列达诺指出，但是，美帝国主义的目的是达不到的。他说，古巴的例子清楚地说明了问题。现在摆在大家面前的事实是：美帝国主义是侵略者，它反对正在为自己的主权而斗争的古巴人民。他说，拉丁美洲各国人民完全确信，古巴革命将击溃帝国主义的侵略而取得胜利，因为古巴革命有古巴人民和整个拉丁美洲和全世界人民的完全支持。
    这位拉丁美洲工人运动的领导人建议拉丁美洲的一切工人组织在尊重每个工人组织独立的条件下举行会议，以便达成关于共同斗争的协议，并且求得组织上的统一。他说，这个任务将分几个阶段去完成：首先是为了共同的目的而进行斗争，最后阶段将是建立一个新的强大的拉丁美洲工人统一工会。
