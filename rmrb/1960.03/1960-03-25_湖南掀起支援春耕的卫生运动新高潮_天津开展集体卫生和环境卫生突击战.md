Hunan Launches New Upsurge in Health Campaign to Support Spring Plowing
Tianjin Launches Collective and Environmental Sanitation Blitz

(Report from our newspaper) A spring pest elimination and hygiene campaign centered on supporting spring plowing production in Hunan Province has ushered in a new high tide.

In the spring pest elimination and hygiene campaign, all localities have focused on improving food hygiene in canteens, monitoring epidemics, carrying out preventive medication, and conducting health publicity. Five thousand canteens in Changde County have established epidemic registration books. Medical personnel monitor the health of commune members through canteen staff and actively carry out disease prevention and treatment work. Xinshi and other communes in You County have established regular medication, fumigation, nasal drops, and cleaning systems in their canteens. Many areas have also universally implemented a "three-vat" system (hot water vat, salt water vat, and preventive medicine vat) in canteens. Malaria anti-relapse treatment and investigation and treatment of various diseases are also carried out centering on canteens. During the campaign, various localities have closely integrated manure accumulation, seized the opportunity, and vigorously eliminated breeding grounds for rats, mosquitoes, and flies. Xiangtan Prefecture, in conjunction with carrying out the spring hygiene campaign, has cleared shady ditches, dug toilet mud and "thousand-foot mud," removed grass, garbage, and pig and cattle manure accumulated in front of and behind houses. The fertilizer accumulated has reached more than 200 million dan. Yanglousi Commune in Linxiang County has also established a "six-fixed" system for manure accumulation and sanitation to households and canteens (the "six-fixed" are fixed leadership, fixed tasks, fixed remuneration, fixed time, fixed quality, and fixed rewards and punishments). In February alone, the commune accumulated more than 620,000 dan of household fertilizer. Hengyang City launched a sanitation campaign to accumulate fertilizer to support the countryside, accumulating 340,000 dan of fertilizer in one month.

Under the unified leadership of Party committees at all levels, more than 210,000 medical and health personnel in the province (including more than 120,000 non-full-time rural health workers) are spread throughout rural areas, deeply involved in canteens, fields, and work groups. Starting from serving production and facilitating the masses, they organize and mobilize the masses to actively carry out disease prevention and treatment and pest elimination and hygiene campaigns. In the past two months, the total number of rats killed is equivalent to 35.3% of the total for last year. A large number of mosquito and fly breeding grounds and overwintering mosquitoes and flies have been eliminated in conjunction with manure accumulation. Due to the strengthening of preventive work, the incidence of spring infectious diseases has decreased by 94% compared with the same period last year. In the first half of March, more than 650,000 people have received malaria anti-relapse treatment, exceeding the original task by 62.5%. At the same time, various localities have repeatedly investigated and treated a large number of patients with schistosomiasis, hookworm disease, and filariasis, and actively treated some chronic diseases that affect production labor, thereby ensuring the health of the labor force.

Medical and health workers fighting on the front lines of spring plowing have adopted many methods to facilitate the masses. The establishment of temporary hospitals, field clinics, the organization of "medicine peddlers," the widespread implementation of mobile medical services, and the vigorous use of local remedies have achieved good results. Ru Gui County, in addition to the existing medical institutions, has also added more than 420 temporary health rooms and first-aid stations, more than 200 field health sheds, and more than 1,200 preventive medicine stations, effectively controlling the occurrence of diseases. The mobile medical team in Leiyang County implemented the "four-to" (to the fields, to the construction sites, to the canteens, to the households) and "four-sides" (treating diseases, publicizing, preventing, and participating in labor) working methods, which have been actively supported by the masses, promoted the pest elimination campaign, and supported spring plowing production.

Party committees at all levels, while leading and organizing spring plowing production, have strengthened their leadership over pest elimination work and have regarded pest elimination work as an important measure to ensure the success of spring plowing production, carrying out unified leadership, deployment, and inspection. The First Secretary of the You County Party Committee personally served as the leader of the pest elimination leading group. Eleven communes have established "Disease Prevention and Spring Plowing Support Headquarters," all headed by the First Secretary of the Party Committee; 175 brigades have also established command sub-departments headed by the secretary, actively leading and carrying out the pest elimination campaign. Party committees in many regions have also used methods such as holding on-site meetings and organizing competitions to promote the development of the pest elimination campaign.

(Report from our newspaper) Five hundred and eighty thousand people in Tianjin launched a vigorous sanitation blitz on the 22nd, vigorously rectifying the city's appearance, carrying out collective and environmental sanitation on a large scale, and vigorously eliminating mosquito and fly breeding conditions.

During the campaign, the secretaries of the district Party committees personally took charge and led the blitz. Street residents, school teachers and students, staff of institutions, and employees of factories and enterprises worked together, dividing up the areas and assigning responsibility to sweep indoors and outdoors, improve environmental sanitation, and eliminate mosquito and fly breeding conditions. According to incomplete statistics, 580,000 people were mobilized in various districts on the evening of the 22nd. Many streets also formed blitz teams. All eight streets in Hedong District launched blitzes for environmental sanitation. The knitting and raw hemp production service cooperatives in Tangjiakou Street mobilized more than 5,000 members to sweep all production workshops, members' residences, and courtyards, giving the environment a completely new look. In Qian Dezhuang Street, Hexi District, every household swept rooms, cleaned courtyards, cleared sewage outlets, and removed garbage. In Quan Ye Chang Street, Heping District, more than 4,000 people were mobilized to sweep the sidewalks of 27 roads clean. Sanitation workers in various districts also worked with the masses to blitz sanitation and promptly remove and transport garbage.

In this environmental sanitation blitz, cooks and nursery workers from street public canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens, and medical personnel from hospitals and health centers closely cooperated, actively participating in the blitz to improve collective hygiene and environmental sanitation. Cooks from 109 public canteens and nursery workers from 95 nurseries and kindergartens in Nankai District carried out environmental sanitation on a large scale and disinfected tableware. Twenty medical personnel from Nankai Hospital helped nursery workers dismantle and wash old bedding and old cotton clothes for the children in Sanba Kindergarten, while publicizing hygiene knowledge to nursery workers and cooks.

Employees of many factories and enterprises in various districts also actively participated in the sanitation blitz. Employees of Tianjin No. 3 Steel Plant, starting a few days ago, have used their spare time to dispose of the messy steel slag and waste steel ingots throughout the plant, filling in the four large pits in the plant and cleaning up various workshops, offices, canteens, etc. (Picture attached)

    湖南掀起支援春耕的卫生运动新高潮
    天津开展集体卫生和环境卫生突击战
    本报讯　湖南省以支援春耕生产为中心的春季除害灭病讲卫生运动，已掀起新的高潮。
    在春季除害灭病讲卫生运动中，各地都以食堂为基地搞好饮食卫生，掌握疫情，开展预防服药和进行卫生宣传。常德县五千个食堂，都建立了疫情登记簿，医务人员通过食堂工作人员掌握社员保健情况，主动地开展疾病防治工作。攸县新市等公社在食堂建立了定期的服药、烟熏、点鼻与清洁制度。很多地区还在食堂普遍实行了“三缸”（开水缸、盐水缸、预防药水缸）制，疟疾抗复发治疗和各种疾病的调查治疗工作，也都是以食堂为中心进行的。运动中，各地紧密结合积肥，抓住时机，大力消灭老鼠和蚊蝇孳生场所。湘潭专区结合开展春季卫生运动，清除阴阳沟，挖厕所泥、千脚泥，铲除屋前屋后草皮、垃圾，清猪牛栏粪等所积的肥料已达二亿多担。临湘县羊楼司公社还订了积肥、搞卫生的六定到户、到食堂的制度（六定是定领导、定任务、定报酬、定时间、定质量、定奖惩），仅2月份一个月内，全社就积了家肥六十二万多担。衡阳市开展积肥支援农村的卫生运动，一个月积肥三十四万多担。
    在各级党委的统一领导下，全省二十一万多医药卫生人员（包括十二万多不脱产的农村保健员），遍布农村各地，深入食堂、田间、作业组，从服务生产，便利群众出发，组织和发动群众，积极开展了防病治病和除四害讲卫生运动。近两个月来，灭鼠总数等于去年全年的35．3％；结合积肥消灭了大量的蚊蝇孳生地和越冬蚊蝇；由于加强了预防工作，春季传染病的发病率比去年同期下降94％；3月上半月内已进行了六十五万多人的疟疾抗复发治疗，超过了原订任务的62．5％。同时，各地还反复调查治疗了大批血吸虫病和钩虫病、丝虫病病人，对一些影响生产劳动的慢性病也进行了积极治疗，从而保证了劳动大军的身体健康。
    战斗在春耕前线的医药卫生工作者，采用很多办法便利群众。建立临时医院、田边诊所，组织药郎担，广泛开展巡回医疗，大力使用土方土法等，收到了良好的效果。汝桂县除原有医疗机构外，还增设临时保健室、急救站四百二十多个，田间保健棚二百多个，预防药站一千二百多个，有力地控制疾病发生。耒阳县的巡回医疗队实行了“四到”（到田间、到工地、到食堂、到户）、“四边”（边看病、边宣传、边预防、边参加劳动）的工作方法，都受到了广大群众的积极拥护，推动了除害灭病运动，支援了春耕生产。
    各级党委在领导和组织春耕大生产的同时，加强了对除害灭病工作的领导，并且把除害灭病工作作为搞好春耕生产的一项重要措施，进行统一领导和布置检查。攸县县委第一书记亲自担任除害灭病领导小组组长，十一个公社都成立了“防治疾病、支援春耕指挥部”，都由党委第一书记担任指挥；一百七十五个大队也以书记为首成立了指挥分部，积极领导开展除害灭病运动。很多地区的党委还用召开现场会、组织评比竞赛等办法，推动了除害灭病运动的开展。
    本报讯　天津市五十八万人在22日展开了一个轰轰烈烈的卫生突击活动，大力整顿市容，大搞集体卫生和环境卫生，大力清除蚊蝇孳生条件。
    运动中，各区区委书记亲自挂帅，领导这次突击活动，街道居民、学校师生、机关、工厂企业职工，一齐动手，按地区分片包干，清扫室内室外、改善环境卫生，消灭蚊蝇孳生条件。据不完全统计，22日晚各区共出动五十八万人，不少街还成立了突击队。河东区全区八个街都展开了突击环境卫生活动。唐家口街针织和原麻两个生产服务分社就出动五千多名社员，把生产车间、社员住室和院落全部打扫一遍，环境面貌焕然一新。河西区谦德庄街，家家户户打扫房间、清扫庭院、清理污水口、清除垃圾。和平区劝业场街出动四千多人将二十七条马路的便道扫得干干净净。各区的清洁队员也和群众一道突击卫生、及时清除运送垃圾。
    在这次突击环境卫生当中，街道公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园的炊事员、保育员和医院、卫生院的医务人员紧密结合，积极投入突击活动，改进集体卫生和环境卫生。南开区的一百零九个公共食堂的炊事员，九十五个托儿所、幼儿园的保育员，大搞环境卫生，进行食具消毒。南开医院二十几名医务人员在三八幼儿园一面帮助保育员给孩子们拆洗旧被褥和旧棉衣，一面向保育员、炊事员宣传卫生知识。
    各区许多工厂企业的职工，也积极参加了卫生突击活动。天津第三钢厂的职工从前几天起，就利用业余时间，将全厂凌乱的钢渣、废钢锭做了处理，填垫了厂内的四个大坑，清扫了各车间、办公室、食堂等处。（附图片）
