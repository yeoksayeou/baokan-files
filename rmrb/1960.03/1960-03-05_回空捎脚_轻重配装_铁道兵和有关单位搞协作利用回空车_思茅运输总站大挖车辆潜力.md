　　Utilize Return Trips, Match Light and Heavy Loads.
　　Railway Corps and Relevant Units Collaborate to Utilize Return Trip Vehicles; Simao Transportation Main Station Explores Vehicle Potential
　　Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd—The People's Liberation Army Railway Corps units constructing the Xiangqian Railway, along with local governments, enterprises, people's communes, and other relevant units, are engaging in large-scale transportation collaboration by utilizing return trip vehicles, enabling both parties to complete their transportation tasks ahead of schedule.
　　During the busy construction transportation, the Railway Corps units are proactively utilizing return trip vehicles to support local transportation. Each month, they conduct detailed research and analysis of the distribution of various transportation points, arrange them uniformly, and then connect with relevant local units near the construction site to sign transportation contracts. The motor vehicle drivers of the troops have also cultivated a good habit of "transporting goods whenever they see them." Whether at transportation points or on their return journey, as long as the route is correct and the local transportation station has materials to be transported, they respond to every request and avoid running empty. In the past half year, this unit has transported 1.9 million ton-kilometers of various materials for local areas, including ore, machinery, and fertilizer. When the people's communes along the line vigorously engaged in fertilizer accumulation, the troops also used return vehicles to support the transportation of fertilizer, transporting 260 tons of fertilizer to the Xiangtang People's Commune in Xiangtan alone.
　　More than ten units, including the Changsha, Shaoyang, and Xiangtan Transportation Bureaus of Hunan Province, as well as industrial and mining enterprises and people's communes along the railway line, have been collaborating with this Railway Corps unit in utilizing return vehicles for transportation. They also report the number of return vehicles on each line during each period to the troop's transportation department for unified dispatch and use, greatly enhancing the troop's transportation capabilities and ensuring a more timely and sufficient supply of road construction materials.
　　According to Yunnan Daily, the Simao Transportation Main Station in Yunnan Province has comprehensively promoted the experience of "matching light and heavy loads" and "carrying extra freight," greatly tapping transportation potential and achieving significant results.
　　"Matching light and heavy loads" means that when transporting lighter goods such as tea, cotton, and empty barrels, heavier goods such as salt and pig iron are appropriately paired to avoid the phenomenon of large volume but low tonnage goods filling the carriage without reaching the designed weight capacity, resulting in wasted transport capacity. "Carrying extra freight" means utilizing return vehicles or vehicles that have not reached their marked tonnage and still have cargo space to transport full truckloads or less-than-truckload freight, while ensuring traffic safety. Vehicles that have reached their marked tonnage also strive to transport 100 to 200 kilograms of goods if cargo space permits. The main station first piloted this experience at Simao Station. Trial results proved that this is a good way to rigorously increase production and practice economy in road transportation.
　　Now, the experience of "matching light and heavy loads" and "carrying extra freight" has been comprehensively promoted at the Mojing, Puer, Yunjinghong, Menghai, and Lancang stations (points) along the Kunluo line of the Simao Main Station.

    回空捎脚　轻重配装
    铁道兵和有关单位搞协作利用回空车　思茅运输总站大挖车辆潜力
    据新华社3日讯　修建湘黔铁路的人民解放军铁道兵部队和地方政府、企业、人民公社等有关单位，利用回空车辆开展运输大协作，使双方运输任务都提前完成。
    铁道兵部队在繁忙的施工运输中，主动地利用回空车辆支援地方运输。他们每月都对各运输点的分布情况进行详细研究和分析，统一安排，然后找工地附近的地方有关单位挂钩，订立承运合同。部队的汽车司机也养成了“见货就运”的良好习惯，他们不管是在运输点或在回返途中，一遇上地方运输站有物资要运，只要线路对头，就有求必应，不跑空车。近半年来，这个部队共为地方运输矿石、机械、肥料等各种物资一百九十万吨公里。沿线人民公社大搞积肥时，部队也利用回空车辆支援运肥料，仅给湘潭享唐人民公社运肥料就有二百六十吨。
    和这支铁道兵部队利用回空车辆大搞运输协作的，有湖南省长沙、邵阳、湘潭运输局和铁路沿线的工矿企业、人民公社等十多个单位，他们也把每个时期在各条线路上的回空车辆数字，报告部队运输部门统一调度使用，大大增强了部队的运输力量，使筑路器材物资得到更及时、充分的供应。
    据云南日报消息　云南思茅运输总站全面推行“轻重配装”和“捎脚运输”经验，大挖运输潜力，获得显著成绩。
      “轻重配装”就是在运茶叶、棉花、空桶等较轻货物时，适当配搭食盐、生铁等较重货物，避免体积大、吨位轻的货物装满车箱而吨位不足、浪费运力的现象。“捎脚运输”就是在确保行车安全的前提下，利用回空汽车或未装足车辆标志吨位及尚有车箱货位的汽车，装运整车或零担货物。已装足标志吨位的车辆，在货位许可的情况下，也争取装运一百公斤至二百公斤货物。这个总站首先在思茅站重点试行了这个经验。试行结果，证明这是公路运输厉行增产节约的一个好办法。
    现在，“轻重配装”和“捎脚运输”的经验，已在思茅总站昆洛线的墨江、普洱、允景洪、勐海、澜沧等站（点）全面推广。
