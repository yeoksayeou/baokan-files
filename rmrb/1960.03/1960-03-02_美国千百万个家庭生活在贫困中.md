Millions of American Families Live in Poverty

According to the United States Information Service, U.S. Vice President Nixon recently stated in a speech to the Detroit Economic Club: "The American economy actually provides the American people with the highest standard of living in the world, and has achieved the 'economic goal of affluence for all.'" But Nixon's lies cannot conceal the reality of the lives of the American people.

From the following three reports taken from American newspapers, we can see the deception of Nixon's boasted "highest standard of living" and "economic goal of affluence for all."

Unemployment, Hunger, Poverty

Desperate Situation Envelops Coal Industry Areas. The Lives of Unemployed Workers are Extremely Miserable. More Than 200,000 People in West Virginia Live on Rations that are "Slowly Starving"

    The "New York Post" recently published a report by its reporter, Malja, who visited the American coal mining area.

    Malja wrote that in today's America, one can see "groups of hungry children, groups of malnourished children...groups of children who do not receive necessary medical care, groups of children who cannot go to school or cannot go to school because they have nothing to eat, nothing to wear, and not even soap to wash their clothes. All of this is happening in America today, in West Virginia."

    Malja emphasized that this serious situation "is not accidental, not due to negligence. This is far from a temporary phenomenon. This desperate situation envelops the coal industry area, including Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and parts of Virginia, a region that has been called a beggar area for many years."

    "People live in dilapidated small houses, which are often blocked from all sides by waste rocks thrown out of the mines. They become more and more depressed day by day. They eat beans to fill their hunger and wait... they have nothing to do but wait, although waiting is not a way out. Stanley, president of the West Virginia State Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations, pointed out not long ago that 65,000 to 70,000 people (or 14%) out of the state's total labor force of 500,000 are unemployed."

    The author pointed out that when the meager unemployment benefits expire, unemployed workers have to face starvation. They have no other hope except for the state authorities to distribute some "surplus food" to families with no income. But it is impossible to survive on this ration. According to Weigby, a spokesman for the West Virginia authorities, in January, 239,000 West Virginia residents (about 12% of the state's residents) relied on this ration to survive. Stanley, president of the West Virginia State Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations, said, "I think these people will slowly starve to death..."

    "...In Piney View, Hue Attf has nine children, aged from six to twenty. She said to me: 'My husband has been out of regular work for three years.' This woman is very thin because she only eats beans and corn cakes. The principal of the local elementary school said: 'Many people here only eat beans and potatoes to survive.'"

    "Hicks of Mohegan looked at his five dirty children, and tears welled up in his eyes. His wife pointed to the two older children, aged seven and nine, and said: 'I didn't ask them to go to school today because I don't have soap to wash their clothes. They are not full. We had beans for lunch today. We can still eat beans tomorrow. I still have a pound of beans and two pounds of potatoes, and I will save these for tomorrow. That's all I have.'"

    "Health Bureau Director Newman said: 'Insufficient food seriously undermines the vitality of residents and their ability to resist disease. The number of people suffering from influenza this winter is twenty times that of last year.'"

Struggling on the Poverty Line

16 Million Families Live in Poverty

The Expansion of Urban Slums is Getting Faster and Faster

    The Democratic Digest, the organ of the Democratic Party of the United States, said in a recent editorial that one of the problems that the United States "needs to solve but has not solved" is: "About 16 million American families are still living in poverty." From 1953 to 1958, the number of people "struggling on the poverty line" with an annual family income of less than $1,000 increased by more than 750,000 (American newspapers believe that a family of four in the United States needs at least $5,000 to $6,000 a year to maintain a "decent" life – Editor's Note). The article cited a report by experts recently submitted to the U.S. Congressional Joint Economic Committee, analyzing the composition of people "living in poverty" in the United States. This is: "8 million elderly people aged 65 or older (accounting for 55% of all elderly people in the United States); 11 million people living in families where the head of the household is unemployed; 8 million people in agricultural families (accounting for 54% of all farm households); 6.4 million people in non-white families; 7 million people living in families where the head of the household is engaged in unskilled work." The report also pointed out that the above categories include 11 million children. The income of these families is less than $2,516 per year.

    Speaking of the housing problem in the United States, the article pointed out that "the situation is also deteriorating, and the expansion of urban slums is getting faster and faster."

    The medical and health problems in the United States are equally serious. The article admits that "the United States now has neither enough doctors, enough hospitals, nor enough nurseries; and many people also have no money to fully utilize the existing facilities." The number of physicians per 100,000 people in the United States is now lower than in 1921. "Millions of Americans are in debt due to medical treatment, and millions more are afraid of going to the doctor in time for fear of incurring debt."

Frail Old Age, Miserable Twilight Years

The Elderly are Only Struggling on the Edge of the Grave

Death is a Mercy for Them

    The plight of the elderly in the United States has become a serious social problem in the United States.

    U.S. Senator McNamara recently said that American society "does not care" for its 16 million citizens aged 65 and older. He said that society has actually "thrown them aside."

    The problem has become so serious that the latest issue of the American magazine "Newsweek" had to publish an article specifically to talk about this problem.

    The article said that 3,000 Americans turn 65 every day, and their retirement life often means a reduction in living standards, because a worker's income suddenly decreases by half to two-thirds from the day he retires.

    The article cited some examples to illustrate the situation of these elderly people. For example, Mrs. Elert, who lives in Chicago, is already 84 years old. She used to be a department store saleswoman. Because the meager pension is not enough to make a living, she has to work half a day on a tying machine every day. "Newsweek" said: "There are millions of such examples, and they mark a problem that is rapidly worsening domestically: how to support the elderly and retirees in the United States."

    The article continued that in the United States, the elderly are most afraid of getting sick. Medical expenses increase by 5% every year. If you have a long-term illness that requires long-term treatment, then even the best-planned retirement budget will collapse. What's worse, many elderly people often dare not ask a doctor for much-needed check-ups because they can't afford it.

    A recent issue of the American "Worker's Weekly" said that New York State has no responsibility for thousands of single old men and women who live on monthly pensions from the federal authorities, which in most cases leaves little after paying the rent. The "Worker's Weekly" pointed out in this regard: "The elderly [in the United States] are only struggling on the edge of the grave, and death is a mercy for them."

    The Democratic Digest said in an article about the lives of the elderly in the United States that there are currently 16 million people in the United States over the age of 65, "most of whom are very poor, and half of them don't even have the money to find a suitable place to live. Some are in good health, but most are not. Some have jobs, but most do not. Some have medical insurance, but most cannot. ... A large number of elderly citizens are currently struggling to make a living on meager pensions, and they feel lonely, insecure, and uncared for."

    The "Democratic Digest" then pointed out that in the face of this situation, Eisenhower actually said, "If Americans want security, they can go to jail. They can have enough to eat in prison, a bed, and a roof over their heads." (Attached picture)

### 美国千百万个家庭生活在贫困中

    美国千百万个家庭生活在贫困中
    据美国新闻处报道，美国副总统尼克松最近在底特律经济俱乐部发表的一篇演说中说：“美国经济实际上为美国人民提供了世界上最高的生活水平，而且已经实现了‘所有的人都富裕的经济目标’”。但是尼克松的谎言并不能掩盖美国人民生活的真实情况。
    从下面三篇取自美国报刊的报道中，我们可以知道尼克松所吹嘘的“最高的生活水平”和“所有的人都富裕的经济目标”的欺骗性。
    失业　饥饿　贫困
    绝望的状况笼罩着煤炭工业区　失业工人的生活极为悲惨西弗吉尼亚州二十多万人靠“令人慢慢饿死”的口粮过活
   “纽约邮报”最近登载了它的记者马尔贾访问美国煤矿区的一篇报道。
    马尔贾写道，在今天的美国，可以看到“一群群饥饿的孩子，一群群营养不足的孩子……一群群得不到必要医疗的孩子，一群群因为没有什么可充饥、没有什么可穿戴、甚至没有肥皂来洗衣服而不能上学的或者不能到学校去的孩子们。所有这一切都发生在今天的美国，在西弗吉尼亚州。”
    马尔贾着重指出，这种严重的情况的“产生并不是偶然的，不是由于注意不周。这远不是什么暂时的现象。这种绝望的状况笼罩着煤炭工业区，包括肯塔基州、宾夕法尼亚州、田纳西州以及弗吉尼亚州的某些部分，这个地区许多年来一直被称为乞丐地区。”
    “人们就住在破旧的小房子里，小房子时常被矿井中抛出的废石堆从各方面挡住。他们一天比一天变得忧郁了。他们吃豆子充饥和等待……除了等待之外，他们没有什么可作的，虽然等待不是一个出路。劳联—产联西弗吉尼亚州工会联合会主席斯坦莱不久前指出，该州劳动力总数五十万人中有六万五千到七万人（也就是14％）没有工作。”
    作者指出，当微薄的失业津贴期满时，失业工人就得面对着饥饿。除了由州当局把一些“剩余粮食”发给没有收入的家庭之外，他们再没有什么别的指望了。但是如果想靠这份口粮维持生活那也是不可能的。据西弗吉尼亚州当局发言人韦格比说，在1月份有二十三万九千西弗吉尼亚州居民（约占全州居民的12％）指望这份口粮过活。劳联—产联西弗吉尼亚州工会联合会主席斯坦莱说，我认为这些人会慢慢饿死……
      “……在皮尼维尤，休阿特夫有九个孩子，年龄从六岁到二十岁。她对我说：‘我的丈夫失去固定的工作已经三年了。’这个妇女由于只吃豆子和玉蜀黍饼，人很消瘦。那里的小学校长说：‘这里有很多人只吃豆子和马铃薯过活。’
    “莫赫甘的希克斯看着自己五个肮脏的孩子，热泪滚滚而下。他的妻子指着七岁和九岁的两个大孩子说：‘今天我不叫他们上学，因为我没有肥皂洗他们的衣服。他们没有吃饱。今天我们中午吃豆子。豆子还可以吃到明天。我还有一磅豆子和两磅马铃薯，我把这些留到明天。这就是我所有的全部东西了。’
    “卫生局局长纽曼说：‘食物不足严重地破坏着居民的生命力和他们抵抗疾病的能力。今年冬天患流行性感冒的人等于去年的二十倍。’”
    在生活线上挣扎
    一千六百万个家庭生活在贫困中
    城市贫民窟的扩大一天比一天快
    美国民主党机关报“民主文摘”在最近发表的一篇编辑部文章中说，美国“需要解决但没有解决”的问题之一是：“目前仍有约一千六百万个美国家庭生活在贫困中”。在1953—1958年，每年家庭收入不到一千美元的“在生活线上挣扎”的人增加了七十五万以上（美国报刊认为美国一个四口之家要维持“过得去”的生活，每年的收入至少要有五、六千美元——编者注）。文章引用最近向美国国会联合经济委员会提出的专家们的一个报告分析了在美国“过着贫困生活”的人的组成，这就是：“八百万个年纪在六十五岁或六十五岁以上的老年人（占美国全部老年人的55％）；生活在家长失业的家庭中的一千一百万人，农业家庭中的八百万人（占全部农户54％）；非白人家庭中的六百四十万人；生活在家长从事非熟练工作的家庭中的七百万人”。报告还指出，在以上几类人中共包括一千一百万名儿童。这些家庭的收入每年不到二千五百一十六美元。
    谈到美国的住房问题，文章指出，“情况也日益恶化，城市贫民窟的扩大一天比一天快”。
    美国的医疗卫生问题也同样严重。文章承认，“美国现在既没有足够的医生，足够的医院，足够的托儿所；而且许多人也无钱充分利用现有设备”。美国现在平均每十万人中拥有的医师数目少于1921年。“数以百万计的美国人由于看病而负债，另外数以百万计的人由于怕负债而不及时看病。
    风烛残年　晚景凄凉
    老年人活着不过是挣扎在坟墓边缘
    死亡对于他们来说反而是一种慈悲
    美国老年人的悲惨处境问题已经成为美国一个严重的社会问题。
    美国参议员麦克纳马拉最近说，美国社会“不照顾”它的一千六百万个六十五岁和年纪更老的公民。他说，实际上社会已经把他们“扔在一边”。
    这个问题已经变得这样严重，以至最新一期的美国“新闻周刊”不得不发表文章来专门谈这个问题。
    文章说，每天要有三千个美国人年满六十五岁，而他们的退休生活往往意味着生活水平的降低，因为一个工人从他退休之日起他的收入就突然减少一半到三分之二。
    文章举了一些例子来说明这些老年人的境况。例如，住在芝加哥的艾勒特女士已经八十四岁了，她本来是百货公司的售货员。由于微薄的养老金不够糊口，她每天不得不在一架结带机上工作半天。“新闻周刊”说：“这样的例子有几百万，它们标志着目前在国内迅速严重化的一个难题：如何养活美国的老年人和退休者。”
    文章接着说，在美国，老年人最害怕的是生病。医疗费用每年增加5％，如果生一场需要长期治疗的病，那么，那怕是计划得最好的退休预算也得垮台。更糟的是，许多老年人因为付不起钱，常常不敢去请医师作十分需要的检查。
    最近一期的美国“工人周报”说，纽约州对于成千上万单身的老头子和老太婆不负任何责任，他们靠联邦当局按月给的养老金糊口，这笔钱在大多数情况下付过房租后就所剩无几了。“工人周报”就此指出：“（美国的）老年人活着不过是挣扎在坟墓的边缘，而死对于他们来说反而是一种慈悲。”
    “民主文摘”在一篇文章中谈到美国老年人的生活时说，美国目前有一千六百万人在六十五岁以上，“其中大多数都非常穷，有一半人甚至没钱找一个合适的地方住。有些人身体是好的，但大多数都不好。有些人有工作，但大多数人没有。有些人享有医药保险，但大多数人不能享有。……大批老年公民目前正靠着为数不足的养老金艰难度日，他们感到孤单、不安全和无人照顾”。
    “民主文摘”接着指出，面对着这种情况，艾森豪威尔竟然说，“如果美国人要的是安全，他们可以进监狱去。他们在监狱可以有足够的东西吃，有一个床位，在头上可以有屋顶。”（附图片）
