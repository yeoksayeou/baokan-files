Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 1st: A national convention to realize the prohibition of nuclear testing, demand the complete abolition of armaments, and prevent the ratification of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" was held in Tokyo today with 1,200 representatives from various regions and sectors of Japan.

The convention also commemorated the sixth anniversary of the deaths of Japanese fishermen who perished in 1954 as a result of the U.S. hydrogen bomb test at Bikini Atoll.

In his report, Ikuo Yasui, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, emphasized that today's convention should be the starting point for this year's anti-nuclear weapons movement dedicated to the complete abolition of all armaments, including nuclear weapons, and the prevention of the revival of Japanese militarism.

Political and cultural leaders attending the convention all spoke in favor of continuing to work for peace through practical actions.

Inejiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Japan Socialist Party, said that the Liberal Democratic Party and the Nobusuke Kishi government have no right to force the Diet to pass the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Asanuma emphasized that the new "Security Treaty" concerns all the people of Japan because it revives Japanese militarism. He called for the dissolution of the Diet and for the issue to be decided by the people.

Shigeo Kamiyama, representative of the Japanese Communist Party, stressed that U.S. imperialism is causing the Japanese people to suffer the indescribable pain of atomic and hydrogen bomb dangers for the third time. Kamiyama went on to say that the spearhead of the anti-atomic and hydrogen bomb movement should therefore be directed at U.S. imperialism.

Abdel Rahman Kiouane, representative of the Algerian National Liberation Front, who was invited to attend the convention, said that the people of Africa will never be intimidated by French nuclear explosions. They will continue their struggle for national independence with even greater vigor. Kiouane called on the Japanese people to unite with the African people and take united action against imperialism.

Also speaking at the meeting were representatives of the victims of Bikini Atoll, representatives of Niijima, where the Kishi government intends to set up a missile test site, and representatives of the Okinawa Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs.

The convention adopted the "March 1st Appeal," calling on the Japanese people to fight to prevent the ratification of the new "Security Treaty" and to oppose the revival of Japanese militarism.

The appeal also called on the Japanese government to enact laws prohibiting the dispatch of Japanese troops abroad, prohibiting Japanese nuclear armament, and prohibiting the entry of nuclear weapons into Japan.

The convention passed a resolution demanding that the Japanese and U.S. governments abolish the newly signed "Security Treaty."

The convention passed a resolution demanding that France stop conducting nuclear tests.

The convention also passed a resolution calling on the United Nations to do its utmost to achieve the permanent prohibition of nuclear testing and complete disarmament.

The convention also passed a letter to the French people and the people of Asia and Africa, hoping that they would strengthen their joint action against France's nuclear testing program.

Participants in the convention held a demonstration after the meeting. At the same time, a delegation of 200 people visited the French Embassy in Tokyo to protest France's nuclear tests in the Sahara.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 29th: The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council issued a statement today condemning the Japanese and U.S. governments for signing the new "Security Treaty" and supporting the heroic struggle of the Japanese people against this treaty.

In a statement issued at a press conference held here this afternoon, the Secretariat pointed out that the signing of the new "Security Treaty" by the Japanese and U.S. governments disregards the universal opposition of the Japanese people and the serious warnings of the people of Asia and Africa, violates the principles of the Bandung and Cairo conferences, and runs counter to the world trend of peaceful coexistence.

The statement said that the continued presence of U.S. troops at hundreds of military bases in Japan for the next ten years is not only completely intolerable to the Japanese people, but also intolerable to the people of Asia and Africa. It is most regrettable that Japan, which was once a victim of atomic bombs, is being armed with nuclear weapons. The statement also condemned the U.S. imperialists for turning Japan into an arsenal in the Far East for their own interests, so that the current abnormal situation in the region will continue forever.

The statement said that the people of Asia and Africa cannot allow the revival of Japanese militarism, which the U.S. imperialists and their Japanese collaborators are already fostering.

The Secretariat then praised the noble struggle of the Japanese people against the presence of U.S. troops in Japan, a struggle that has been constantly strengthened in the past decade, especially after the Japanese people rose up to protest against the signing of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" last year.

The statement continued that all the movements of the Japanese people are a struggle against typical imperialism and neo-colonialism represented by U.S. imperialism. The statement welcomed the Second All-African People's Conference held in Tunis at the end of January because this meeting focused attention on exposing the true face of neo-colonialism, through which the imperialists stubbornly carry out conspiracies in order to maintain their rule over the African people. The statement said that, in this sense, the Japanese people are following a common path of struggle with the African people against a common enemy.

The statement concluded by expressing support for the people of all walks of life in Japan who are struggling to establish a peaceful, independent, democratic, and neutral Japan, and supporting the Japanese people's desire to establish normal diplomatic relations and promote friendly relations with Asian and African countries. The statement also welcomed the 2,500-kilometer march that began from the southern end of the Japanese islands to demand the return of Okinawa to Japan and protest the establishment of U.S. atomic outposts there.

    亚非人民团结理事会发表声明支持日本人民反对日美条约的斗争
    新华社1日讯　东京消息：日本各地和各界代表一千二百人今天在东京举行实现禁止核试验、要求彻底废除军备、阻止批准新日美“安全条约”国民大会。
    大会还纪念1954年在比基尼岛遭受美国氢弹试验危害而牺牲的日本渔民遇难六周年。
    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁在报告中强调指出，今天举行的大会应当成为今年致力于彻底废除包括核武器在内的一切军备和阻止日本军国主义复活的事业的反对核武器运动的起点。
    出席大会的政界和文化界领袖都在讲话中主张以实际行动来继续为和平而努力。
    日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎说，自由民主党和岸信介政府没有权力强使国会通过新日美“安全条约”。浅沼强调说，新“安全条约”与日本全体人民有关，因为它使日本军国主义复活。他要求解散国会，把这个问题交给人民来决定。
    日本共产党代表神山茂夫着重指出，美帝国主义正在使日本人民三度遭受难以述说的原子弹和氢弹危险的痛苦。神山茂夫接着说，因此，反对原子弹和氢弹运动的矛头应当指向美帝国主义。
    应邀出席大会的阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线代表阿布德·拉曼·基欧安说，非洲各国人民决不会被法国的核爆炸所吓倒。他们将更加振奋地继续进行争取民族独立的斗争。基欧安呼吁日本人民起来同非洲人民采取一致行动，共同反对帝国主义。
    在会上发言的还有在比基尼岛受害人的代表、岸信介政府打算在那里设置导弹试验场的新岛的代表以及冲绳禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会代表。
    大会通过了“3月1日呼吁书”，呼吁日本人民进行斗争，来阻止批准新“安全条约”和反对日本军国主义复活。
    呼吁书还要求日本政府制订禁止日本派兵出国、禁止日本核武装和把核武器运入日本的法律。
    大会通过决议，要求日本政府和美国政府废除新签订的“安全条约”。
    大会通过决议，要求法国停止进行核试验。
    大会还通过决议，要求联合国竭尽全力实现永远禁止核试验和实现彻底裁军。
    大会还通过致法国人民和亚非各国人民书，希望他们加强联合行动，反对法国的核试验计划。
    参加大会的人在会后举行了示威游行。同时，由二百人组成的一个代表团访问了法国驻东京大使馆，抗议法国在撒哈拉进行核试验。
    新华社开罗29日电　亚非人民团结理事会书记处今天发表声明，谴责日美两国政府签订新的“安全条约”，并且支持日本人民为反对这项条约所进行的英勇斗争。
    书记处在今天下午在这里举行的记者招待会上发表的声明中指出，日美两国政府签订新的“安全条约”，是无视日本人民的普遍反对和亚非各国人民的严重警告，违反了万隆和开罗会议的原则，并且同和平共处的世界趋势背道而驰。
    声明说，美国军队将在今后十年内继续驻在成百个设在日本的军事基地上，这不仅是日本人民完全不能容忍，也是亚非各国人民所不能容忍的。最令人遗憾的是，曾经是原子弹受害者的日本竟然用核武器武装起来。声明还谴责美帝国主义者为了他们本身的利益，把日本变成远东的兵工厂，以便使这个地区目前的不正常局势永远存在。
    声明说，亚非各国人民不能容许美帝国主义者和他们的日本合作者已经在扶植的日本军国主义的复活。
    书记处接着赞扬日本人民为反对美国军队驻在日本所进行的崇高的斗争，这种斗争在过去十年内，特别是去年日本人民奋起抗议签订新的日美“安全条约”以后，一直在不断加强。
    声明继续说，日本人民的一切运动都是反对以美帝国主义为代表的典型的帝国主义和新殖民主义的斗争。声明欢迎1月底在突尼斯举行的第二届全非人民大会，因为这次会议把注意力集中在揭露新殖民主义的真正面目上，帝国主义者通过新殖民主义顽固地进行阴谋活动以便保持他们对非洲人民的统治。声明说，就这个意义而言，日本人民同非洲人民走着共同的斗争道路，反对共同的敌人。
    声明最后表示支持为建立和平、独立、民主和中立的日本而进行斗争的日本各阶层人民，并且支持日本人民希望同亚非各国建立正常外交关系和促使友好关系的愿望。声明还表示欢迎从日本岛屿南端开始的为要求把冲绳岛交还给日本和抗议美国在那里设立原子前哨基地的长达二千五百公里的大游行。
