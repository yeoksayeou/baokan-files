Xinhua News Agency, March 24th -- People from All Walks of Life in the Capital Support the Resolution of the Japanese Conference of the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference

    Chinese representatives from all walks of life in the capital solemnly held a conference in Beijing on March 24, 1960, to express the Chinese people's warm support and heartfelt congratulations to the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference to be held in Conakry, and decided to send a delegation to participate in the Conakry Conference.
    Since the First Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, the struggle of the Asian and African peoples against imperialism and for national independence has greatly developed and achieved a series of major victories, especially the unprecedented upsurge of the African people's struggle against colonialism and for national independence, which has fundamentally shaken the imperialist colonial system on the African continent. All this has heavily struck the imperialist forces of war and aggression and made outstanding contributions to the cause of maintaining world peace. Under this new situation of the continuous victories of the Asian and African peoples, the convening of the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference is of great significance for further promoting the Asian-African national independence movement.
    At present, the world's forces of peace far outweigh the imperialist forces of war and aggression. This situation is very favorable to the struggle of the Asian and African peoples for national independence. Although the imperialist bloc headed by the United States is not reconciled to its shameful failure and is still making a last-ditch struggle, trying every means to undermine the national independence movement of the Asian and African peoples, as long as the Asian and African peoples heighten their vigilance, strengthen their unity, and persist in the struggle, any imperialist conspiracies will continue to be smashed, and the struggle of the Asian and African peoples will surely achieve greater victories.
    The Chinese people have always firmly supported the struggle of the Asian and African peoples for national independence and have been constantly encouraged by their struggles and victories. We sincerely hope that the Asian and African peoples who are striving for national independence will smash the shackles of colonialism as soon as possible, and that the Asian and African countries that have achieved independence can rapidly develop their respective national economies and get rid of the backwardness caused by colonial rule as soon as possible. In the common struggle against imperialism and in the cause of developing national economies, the Chinese people will always be closely united and support each other with the Asian and African peoples. Before the convening of the Second Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference, we wish the conference new contributions to further promoting the Bandung spirit, strengthening the unity of the Asian and African peoples, promoting the national independence movement, and safeguarding the cause of world peace.
        March 24, 1960, in Beijing

    首都各界人民支持第二届亚非人民团结大会日大会决议
    新华社24日讯　首都各界人民支持第二届亚非人民团结大会日大会决议
    中国首都各界代表于1960年3月24日在北京隆重举行大会，表达中国人民对即将在科纳克里举行的第二届亚非人民团结大会的热烈支持和衷心祝贺，并决定派出代表团参加科纳克里大会。
    自第一届亚非人民团结大会举行以来，亚非各国人民反对帝国主义、争取和维护民族独立的斗争有了很大的发展，并且取得了一连串重大的胜利，特别是非洲人民反对殖民主义、争取民族独立斗争的空前高涨，从根本上震撼了帝国主义在非洲大陆的殖民体系。这一切，沉重地打击了帝国主义战争侵略势力，对维护世界和平的事业作出了卓越的贡献。在亚非人民不断取得胜利的这种新形势下，第二届亚非人民团结大会的召开，对于进一步推动亚非民族独立运动具有重大的意义。
    目前，全世界和平力量已经远远超过了帝国主义的战争侵略势力。这种形势对于亚非人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争十分有利。虽然以美国为首的帝国主义集团并不甘心于它们可耻的失败，仍在进行垂死挣扎，千方百计地破坏亚非人民的民族独立运动，但是，只要亚非人民提高警惕，加强团结，坚持斗争，帝国主义的任何阴谋诡计都将继续遭到粉碎，亚非人民的斗争必将取得更大的胜利。
    中国人民一贯坚决支持亚非人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争，并且从他们的斗争和胜利中不断地得到鼓舞。我们衷心希望，正在争取民族独立的亚非人民早日粉碎殖民主义的枷锁，已经取得独立的亚非国家能够迅速发展各自的民族经济，早日摆脱殖民主义统治所造成的落后状态。在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中和发展民族经济的事业中，中国人民将永远同亚非各国人民紧密团结相互支援。在第二届亚非人民团结大会召开之前，我们预祝大会对进一步发扬万隆精神，加强亚非人民的团结，促进民族独立运动以及保卫世界和平的事业，作出新的贡献。
        1960年3月24日于北京
