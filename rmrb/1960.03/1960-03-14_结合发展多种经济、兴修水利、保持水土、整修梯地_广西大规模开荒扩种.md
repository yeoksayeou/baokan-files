Guangxi is carrying out large-scale land reclamation and cultivation by combining land reclamation with the development of diversified economy, water conservancy construction, soil and water conservation, and terrace improvement, so as to achieve a large quantity and good quality of land reclamation and cultivation, taking into account both current and long-term interests. By the end of February, the entire autonomous region had reclaimed more than 10 million mu of barren hills and wasteland. Various localities have promptly planted large amounts of coarse grains, beans, and cash crops in the newly reclaimed land.

In the large-scale land reclamation and cultivation, various localities have generally paid attention to the "four combinations" in land reclamation. First, combine land reclamation with the development of diversified economy. Adopt the method of having diversified economy go up the mountains and grain crops go down to the plains, turning the newly reclaimed land into comprehensive horticultural farms, operating cassava hills, flower and fruit hills, medicinal herb gardens, pig farms, bee farms, etc.; and in places where diversified economy was originally operated, more grain crops can be cultivated due to the further improvement of water conservancy and irrigation conditions. Yulin Prefecture has adopted this method, which not only promotes the development of diversified economy, but also expects that the grain harvested from expanded cultivation will be close to the total output of the early crop last year. Second, combine land reclamation with water conservancy. In addition to strictly paying attention to protecting water sources when reclaiming barren hills and wasteland, various localities have been vigorously carrying out land reclamation activities while vigorously developing water conservancy under the slogan of "where water conservancy is built, land reclamation will be carried out." LaiBin, Guixian, Pingnan, Guiping and other counties, which have been suffering from drought for many years, have turned the soil and introduced water to many wastelands in preparation for planting rice by combining land reclamation and water conservancy. Third, combine land reclamation with soil and water conservation. Generally, various localities do not reclaim barren hills and wasteland with slopes of more than 25 degrees. If reclamation is necessary, the method of digging fish-scale pits for planting is adopted to maintain soil and water; on slopes of about 20 degrees, agroforestry intercropping is generally implemented after reclamation. This year, the entire autonomous region afforested more than 15 million mu of barren hills, of which nearly 3 million mu were agroforestry intercropping, and fish-scale pits can be seen everywhere in the mountains. After reclaiming flat wasteland, general attention is paid to digging drainage ditches to maintain soil and water and ensure crop growth. The more than 4 million mu of cassava planted in the entire autonomous region generally adopt the planting method of opening ditches and raising ridges. Fourth, combine land reclamation with terrace improvement. Gradually transform slopes into terraces after reclamation, which can make the land flat, facilitate cultivation, and increase crop yields; it can also maintain soil and water. While reclaiming land, Du'an Yao Autonomous County repaired stone-lined terraces. More than 20,000 people fought for more than 20 days and turned more than 20,000 mu of slopes into terraces.

Due to the implementation of the "four combinations," the land reclamation and cultivation in various localities is not only large in quantity, but also good in quality. Most of the newly reclaimed wasteland is ploughed with new farm implements such as double-wheel double-furrow plows, and the new soil is crushed, harrowed, leveled, and fertilized before crops are planted. Yulin Prefecture widely organized technical guidance teams to go to various places to carry out land reclamation and inspection, and make quality assessments. According to the requirements of not planting if the harrowing is not broken, not planting if the land is not level, and not planting if the base fertilizer is insufficient, Longjin County has planted more than 150,000 mu of early corn, and the specifications and quality have reached the standards of general crop land. Nanning Prefecture generally applied 50 to 100 dan of base fertilizer per mu in the newly reclaimed land.

### 结合发展多种经济、兴修水利、保持水土、整修梯地  广西大规模开荒扩种

    结合发展多种经济、兴修水利、保持水土、整修梯地
    广西大规模开荒扩种
    已开荒山荒地一千万亩以上，新垦耕地及时种上杂粮、豆类和经济作物
    本报南宁13日电　广西僮族自治区各地在大规模开荒扩种中，实行开荒与发展多种经济相结合、开荒与兴修水利相结合、开荒与水土保持相结合、开荒与整修梯地相结合，做到开荒扩种数量多，质量好，既照顾目前利益，又注意到长远利益。到2月底，全自治区开荒已达一千万亩以上。各地已在新垦地里，及时地种上大量的杂粮、豆类和经济作物。
    在大规模开荒扩种中，各地普遍注意到开荒中的“四结合”。一、开荒与发展多种经济相结合。采取多种经济上山，粮食作物下平川的办法，把新垦地辟为综合园艺场，经营木薯山、花果山、药圃、猪场、蜜蜂场等等；而原来经营多种经济的地方，由于水利灌溉条件的进一步改善，可腾出来多种粮食作物。玉林专区采取这个办法，不仅促进多种经济的发展，并且预计扩种收获的粮食可接近去年早造的总产量。二、开荒与水利相结合。各地在开垦荒山荒地时除了严格注意保护水源以外，在“水利修到哪里，开荒开到那里”的口号下，在大搞水利的同时大搞开荒活动。连年干旱的来宾、贵县、平南、桂平等县，由于做到开荒与水利相结合，现在不少荒地都翻过土，引进了水，准备种植水稻。三、开荒与水土保持相结合。各地一般都做到坡度二十五度以上的荒山荒地不开荒，要开则采取挖鱼鳞坑种植的办法，以保持水土；在二十度上下的坡地，开荒后一般也都实行农林混种。今年全自治区荒山造林一千五百多万亩，其中农林混种近三百万亩，鱼鳞坑遍山皆有。平坡荒地开垦后，一般都注意开好水沟，以保持水土，保证作物生长。全自治区已种下的四百多万亩木薯，普遍采用了开沟起垅的种植方法。四、开荒与整修梯地相结合。开荒后逐步把坡地整修为梯地，这样可以使土地平坦，耕作方便，作物产量高；又可以保持水土。都安瑶族自治县一边开荒，一边修砌石埂梯地，二万多人奋战二十多天，就把二万多亩坡地变成梯地。
    由于实行了“四结合”，各地的开荒扩种不仅数量多，而且质量好。多数新垦荒地用双轮双铧犁等新农具翻土，把新土打碎耙平施肥后才种上作物。玉林专区广泛组织技术指导组，分赴各地边开荒、边检查，作出质量鉴定。龙津县各公社按照耙土不碎、整地不平不种，基肥不足不种的要求，已种下十五万多亩早玉米，规格质量都达到一般作物地的标准。南宁专区在新垦地里，每亩普遍施下基肥五十到一百担。
