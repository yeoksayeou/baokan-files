    Aerial Survey of Heilongjiang
    Wang Yi
    Around two o'clock in the morning, a whistle blew, and dozens of pilots got out of bed. They were all members of the Civil Aviation Survey Team. A few years ago, with the help of Soviet experts, they quickly mastered the techniques of aerial photography. Now, they frequently fly in the skies of the motherland, dedicating their efforts to the great socialist construction.
    A deep blue sky. Countless stars reflected on the silver frost on the ground, foretelling a clear day ahead.
    Dawn came especially early. The pilots received their flight assignments in the dispatch room. One by one, the planes took off from the Hailar Airport. The aircraft fleet swept across the vast Hulunbuir Grassland and flew over the narrow, ribbon-like Yimin River. The Hulunbuir Grassland is home to countless cattle and sheep, and animal husbandry is highly developed, but grain production is low. In order to transform this grassland into the granary of Eastern Mongolia, the Party and the government are preparing to develop agriculture here on a large scale. The aerial survey team once conducted wasteland surveys in this area, and the data obtained proved that the Party and government's grand plan is entirely feasible.
    The plane continued to climb. The continuous Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains were right in front of them. Thin mist lingered among the mountains, and the vast forests resembled a boundless ocean. A few years ago, this sparsely populated primeval forest was still a mystery. Although ground forest prospecting personnel had done a lot of work, the aerial survey team mainly relied on aerial photography to promptly provide various data for the development of this primeval forest. Now, whenever the pilots fly their planes over the forest and see large-scale logging operations taking place, and see trains carrying large quantities of timber, their hearts are filled with joy.
    The plane had already flown to the Sino-Soviet border. They were going to conduct aerial surveys along the Heilongjiang River and the Argun River. This is part of the huge project for the joint development of the Heilongjiang River Basin by China and the Soviet Union. This task has been largely completed. Today is the last mission for the aerial survey of Heilongjiang. Under the sunshine, the Heilongjiang River, like a silver-white ribbon, was already visible in the distance. The plane had climbed to an altitude of 4,500 meters. The air was thin, and the pilots put on oxygen masks. The cabin began to bustle with activity. The navigator watched a mountain peak in the distance, which was the designated entry point for the survey area on the map. The plane flew past at a speed of five kilometers per minute, and the target got closer and closer. When the navigator gave the command, "Start working!" the photographer immediately turned on the power switch, and the aerial electric camera made a "click, click" sound. With this rhythmic sound, its bowl-sized lens continuously photographed the scenery of the earth. The flight requirements for aerial surveying are very strict. The plane must maintain a certain distance between two parallel survey lines. It must not only fly straight but also fly smoothly, otherwise, it will affect the effect of the photography.
    The plane shuttled back and forth in the survey area, and the work went smoothly. But at ten o'clock, due to the sunshine, a huge air current rose from the mountains and violently attacked the plane. Due to the influence of the air current, two opposite wind directions appeared on a fifty-kilometer-long survey line. When the plane had just adjusted its course with a positive ten-degree drift, a negative ten-degree drift suddenly appeared. Under such circumstances, the plane could have returned, but at this time no one had such an idea. In order not to miss the good weather, everyone was determined to fight the adverse air currents. The captain shouted loudly, "Work!" His eyes were sometimes on the instruments, sometimes on the front, and his hands gripped the control stick tightly, doing his best to keep the plane flying level. The navigator accurately grasped each target and issued commands from time to time. The photographer's hands did not leave the aiming scope, and he adjusted the angle of the camera with agile movements. The onboard mechanic carefully observed the instruments and helped the captain control the engine throttle. The onboard radio operator kept in touch with the base on the one hand, and on the other hand, he went to help wherever the work was tense. The entire crew cooperated closely, united like one person. The plane was blown off course by the air current and was immediately corrected, and when it bumped, it was immediately pressed down, one round after another. Although the temperature in the cabin was minus six degrees Celsius, the pilots were all sweating profusely.
    It wasn't until after half-past eleven that the airflow gradually stabilized, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief. At this time, the radio operator opened the lunch box and took out steamed buns and sausages to everyone. They had eaten breakfast at two o'clock in the morning, and it had been eight or nine hours, and they were really a bit hungry. But everyone was wearing oxygen masks, so the way of eating had to be a little special: put on the mask to take a few breaths of oxygen, then take off the mask to take a bite of food, and that's how they dealt with lunch. After eating, they unknowingly flew another distance. The Heilongjiang River flashed under the wing. On both sides of the river stood majestic mountain peaks, as if telling people that the Heilongjiang River has endless power, and if this power is fully developed, it will forever benefit the people of China and the Soviet Union.
    At half-past twelve in the afternoon, the voice of the base commander sounded in the earphones, "Stop working and return to base immediately." The captain replied, "Understood," and turned the plane around to fly back to base. They returned victoriously after flying continuously for nine and a half hours. The aerial survey pilots returned with smiles, their hearts filled with glory and pride.

    航测黑龙江
    王毅
    深夜两点钟光景，一声哨响，几十个飞行员都起了床。他们都是民用航空测量队的队员。几年前，他们在苏联专家的帮助下，很快地掌握了航空摄影的技术。现在，他们经常在祖国的天空里飞来飞去，为伟大的社会主义建设献出了自己的力量。
    一片深蓝色的天空。繁星映照着地上的银霜，预告着新的一天将是万里晴空。
    黎明来得特别早。飞行员们在调度室里接受了飞行任务。飞机一架接一架地从海拉尔机场起飞了。机群掠过辽阔的呼伦贝尔草原，飞过了狭长如带的依敏河。在呼伦贝尔草原上有无数的牛羊，牧畜业非常发达，但是生产的粮食却很少。为了使这一片草原变为东蒙的粮仓，党和政府准备在这里大规模地发展农业。航测队曾经在这一带进行荒地测量，根据所得的资料，证明了党和政府的这个宏伟计划是完全能够实现的。
    飞机在继续爬升。绵亘的大小兴安岭就在眼前。山岭间薄雾缭绕，大片的森林好像汪洋大海。几年前，这个人迹罕到的原始森林还是一个谜。虽然地面森林勘探人员做了很多工作，但主要还是依靠航空测量队用空中摄影的方法，及时地提供了开发这个原始森林的各种资料。现在，每当飞行员们驾驶着飞机飞过森林的上空，看到漫山遍野的木材正在进行着大规模的采伐，看到一列列火车载运着大批木材的时候，他们心里充满了喜悦。
    飞机已经飞临中苏边境。他们要在沿黑龙江和额尔古纳河一带进行航测。这是中苏两国共同开发黑龙江流域的巨大工程的一部分。这个任务已经大部分完成了。今天，是航测黑龙江的最后一次任务。在阳光照耀下，黑龙江像一条银白色的带子，已遥遥在望。飞机已爬高到四千五百米。空气稀薄了，飞行员都戴上了供氧面罩。机舱里开始忙碌起来。领航员注视着远方的一个山头，那是在地图上选定的测区进入点。飞机以每分钟五公里的速度飞过去，目标越来越近了。当领航员下了一个口令：“开始工作！”摄影员马上打开了电门开关，航空电动照像机发出了“哒哒”的声音。在这种有节奏的声音里，它那碗口一般的镜头把大地的景物连续地拍摄下来。航空测量的飞行要求是十分严格的。飞机在两条平行测线之间必须保持一定的距离，不仅要飞得直，而且要飞得平稳，否则就会影响摄影的效果。
    飞机在测区里穿梭飞行，工作很顺利。但是到十点钟的时候，由于阳光照射的关系，从群山丛中升起了一股巨大的气流，猛烈地袭击着飞机。由于气流的影响，在一条五十公里长的测线上，出现两种相反的风向，当飞机刚刚按正十度的偏流调整了航向，突然又出现一个负十度的偏流。按说在这样的情况下，飞机是可以返航的，但是这时谁也没有这种念头。为了不放过好天，大家决心与恶劣的气流搏斗。机长大声地喊着：“干！”他的眼睛时而瞅着仪表，时而注视前方，两手握紧操纵杆，全力使飞机保持平飞状态。领航员准确地抓住每一个目标，不时地发出口令。摄影员的双手不离瞄准镜，用敏捷的动作调整摄影机的角度。随机机械员仔细地观察着仪表，帮助机长操纵发动机油门。随机报务员一面同基地保持联络，一面看哪里工作紧张，他就到那里去帮忙。整个机组密切协作，团结得像一个人一样。飞机被气流吹偏马上就纠正，颠起来马上就被压下去，一个回合接着一个回合。尽管机仓里的温度是摄氏零下六度，飞行员们却一个个都汗流满面。
    直到十一点半以后，气流才渐渐地稳定下来，人们都舒了一口气。这时报务员打开了饭盒，取出馒头和腊肠送到每个人的面前。他们是在早晨两点多钟吃的早饭，已经过了八九个小时，肚子真的有点饿了。但是大家都戴着氧气面罩，吃饭的方式只好特别一点：戴上面罩吸几口氧气，再脱下面罩吃一口饭，就这样把一顿午饭对付过去了。吃完饭，不知不觉又飞了一段路程。黑龙江在机翼下一闪而过。在大江两岸矗立着雄劲的山峰，它好像在告诉人们，黑龙江有着无穷无尽的力量，如果把这个力量充分地开发出来，将会给中苏两国人民永远造福。
    午后十二点半，耳机里响起了基地指挥员发出的“停止工作，立即返航”的声音，机长回答一声“明白”，便调转机头飞回基地。他们在连续飞行了九个半小时以后，胜利地回来了。航测飞行员带着微笑，内心里充满着光荣和自豪。
