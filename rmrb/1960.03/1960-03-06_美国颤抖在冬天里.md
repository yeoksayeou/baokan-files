    America Trembles in Winter
    Ziyue
    While the east wind blows, and all things revive in spring, America is still "trembling in a winter of discontent." This is according to a report by Don Iddon, chief New York correspondent for the British Conservative newspaper, the "Daily Mail."

    The report said that in America, "the arrogance and swagger have disappeared," and "the storm of self-criticism is growing fiercer"; and the content of this so-called "self-criticism" is: "Has America become weaker?" "Is this country in decline?" What caused the "storm" was "mainly the Soviet Union's achievements in rockets, missiles, and lunar rockets." Obviously, what the author is reporting here is the "great debate" that has recently unfolded in the United States surrounding the issue of the "gap" in missiles lagging behind the Soviet Union. Indeed, in this "great debate," the dissatisfaction, frustration, and pessimism expressed by the American ruling class regarding American policy, status, and future overwhelmed everything, and it is no exaggeration to call it a "storm."

    The scientific conclusion that "the East Wind prevails over the West Wind" has been increasingly proven by facts. Although the ruling groups in the United States and other Western countries are firmly unwilling to admit it, this situation has become the theme of American "self-pity."

    Recently, in a series of articles, Lippmann not only compared military strength but also concluded that the United States lagged behind the Soviet Union in terms of overall national power. He said, "In terms of national power, in terms of overall military capabilities, in the race to open up outer space, in the comparison of economic growth rates, and in education, we (the United States) are behind (the Soviet Union) and have failed to maintain our position." He could not help but lament that the United States had become a second-rate country.

    An article in the February 15th issue of the American magazine "Newsweek" further drew its own conclusions from the competition between the two systems. The article wrote: Some people in the United States "see 654 million Chinese people dedicated to the arduous task of conquering nature, and they also note the extraordinary efforts and determination that have enabled Russia to make progress in technology, diplomacy, and economics, and they are alarmed. Competing with such a cruel purpose, what image does America present to the world? … Is America’s vitality, its vigorous spirit, its ‘tenacious resilience’ resilient enough? This is an extremely puzzling question." The author of this article admits: In the competition between the two systems, "America is indeed gradually failing."

    Not only that, but an American congressman, former US Ambassador to India, Bowles, in looking ahead to the 1960s in America, based on "four revolutionary forces that have brought about earth-shattering changes in the world over the past twelve years (referring to the rise of national democratic movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the strong development of the Soviet Union, the rise of People's China, and the unprecedented revolution in weapons technology)," said worriedly: "If what we (the United States) do in the 1960s will determine the fate of this generation of Americans or even future generations of Americans, I don't think it's an overstatement. We are about to undergo a very important test." This means that the revolutionary changes in the short 1950s have made the "fate" of the American capitalist system face a decisive test in the 1960s.

    According to Bowles, this test, or the "challenge" facing the United States, is not only military, nor is it only a "narrow economic competition," but "directly touches the heart of our (American) democratic society. It is the ultimate test of the nature of our society." In this way, Bowles has gone a big step further than Lippmann and the aforementioned remarks in "Newsweek." The change of America becoming a second-rate country and gradually failing reflects the corrupt and declining process of the capitalist system.

    The above-quoted remarks are representative. In the United States, all those who cannot but admit that America's world position is declining sharply and feel frustrated and pessimistic about the competition between the two systems, no matter how they say it verbally or how they distort the true situation of the world, cannot help but feel that the prospect facing America is that the end of world capitalism is getting closer and closer. "Christian Science Monitor" reporter Harsch said that in the United States, "when it comes to the future, ... it cannot even be certain that what has recently been called the 'American Century' will become something longer than the 'American Decade.'" The American bourgeoisie, who have always harbored ambitions to dominate the world and arrogantly announced the "American Century," now feel that the future is uncertain about what kind of changes will happen in the United States in the next ten years. How can this not alarm the American bourgeoisie!

    It is precisely because of this that the American ruling group tries its best to avoid touching such issues, just like owls are afraid of seeing the sun. Eisenhower denounced all those who "showed shocking pessimism about the American system" and "made a fuss," and when he heard someone talk about the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system, he cursed this view as "arrogant." Naturally, the ruling group represented by Eisenhower will never admit defeat. The capitalist defenders suffering from so-called "self-criticism mania," like Bowles, also expressed "heartfelt welcome" to the "various statements" made by Eisenhower in his State of the Union address, believing that "these statements seem to reflect that people in the government are increasingly understanding the magnitude and depth of the world forces that we (the United States) must deal with." The State of the Union address is precisely the American ruling group's "battle plan" to deal with this massive "world force." While trying to continue to adhere to the "war strategy," it also adopts the so-called "peace strategy" to corrode, divide, and paralyze the forces striving for peace and socialism; it plays with dollars, sticks, and divisive tactics, suppresses national democratic movements, buys time, steps up preparations for war, and reverses the military decline. Reactionaries have never voluntarily withdrawn from the stage of history, and "desperate struggles" are their true colors.

    However, "deterrence," "dollar diplomacy," and the infamous "liberation" policy are no longer "magical remedies," because since they cannot save the United States from falling into today's declining situation, they cannot stop this situation from deteriorating. The American ruling group cannot help but be "anxious and annoyed," and the reason lies here. The "Daily Mail," a British Conservative newspaper, saw this "morbid state" of the United States, but he could only touch the fur of its root cause. He said that America "is accustomed to being in the first place in terms of strength and ability, so it gets anxious even when it hears that it is in the second place." In fact, such "habits" and "anxiety" are by no means unique quirks of the American bourgeoisie. When the "specter of communism" was "haunting Europe," all the reactionary forces in old Europe, who were accustomed to regarding the systems of oppression and exploitation as "sacred and inviolable," became anxious and united to drive out this "specter." At that time, the rule of the bourgeoisie was truly "in the first place," but they were already trembling in the face of the communist revolution. When the first socialist country rose on one-sixth of the earth's land and the era of capitalist "stability" came to an end, all the reactionary forces in old Europe and the emerging American modern slave owners, who were accustomed to carrying out imperialist massacres, dividing colonies, and strangling revolutions, also became anxious and united to carry out armed intervention and blockade the Soviet Union. At that time, compared with the young socialist Soviet Union, all these reactionary forces could be regarded as "in the first place," but the result was a more tragic situation. The course of history is thus evolving according to its own laws.

    What makes the United States lose confidence and become irritated? The reporter of the British "Daily Mail" obviously cannot provide a real answer to this question. Perhaps because of shared suffering, he concluded in a sympathetic tone: "At least the patient knows that he is sick - this is the first step to recovery." However, the British Conservatives have known for many years what disease the British capitalist system has suffered from, but they have been unable to restore its health, and on the contrary, it is dying and setting in the west; then, what effect can the comfort to their Anglo-Saxon allies have today?

    The Wall Street monopoly capital group has long lost its spring, and the United States can only tremble in winter now.

    美国颤抖在冬天里
    子悦
    当东风吹拂，万象回春的时候，美国却仍然“颤抖在不满情绪的冬天里”。这是英国保守党报纸“每日邮报”驻纽约首席记者唐·伊顿的报道。
    这篇报道说，在美国，“趾高气扬和摇头摆尾的气焰已经消失了”，“自我批评的风暴愈来愈猛烈”；而这种所谓“自我批评”的内容是：“美国变弱了吗”？“这个国家是不是在衰微下去了？”引起“风暴”的，“主要是苏联在火箭导弹和月球火箭方面的成就”。显然，作者在这里所报道的，是最近美国围绕导弹方面落后于苏联的“差距”问题而展开的“大辩论”。的确，在这一场“大辩论”中，美国统治阶级内部对美国政策、地位和前途表现出的不满、沮丧和悲观情绪，压倒了一切，说它是一阵“风暴”，并不为过。
    “东风压倒西风”的科学论断，已经日益为事实所证明。美国和其他西方国家的统治集团尽管坚决不愿加以承认，然而，这种形势已经成为美国“自怨自艾”的主题了。
    最近李普曼在连续发表的文章中，就不仅从军事力量的对比，而且从整个国家力量的对比方面作出了美国落后于苏联的结论。他说，“从国家力量方面来说，在总的军事能力方面，在开辟外层空间的竞赛方面，在经济增长率对比方面，在教育方面，我们（美国）都落在（苏联）后面，而没有能保持我们的地位”。他不禁哀叹道，美国已经成了二等国家了。
    2月15日一期美国“新闻周刊”的一篇文章，还进一步从两个制度的竞赛作出自己的结论。文章写道：美国一些人“看到六亿五千四百万中国人致力于征服自然的艰巨任务，他们也注意到使俄国在技术、外交和经济方面获得进展的异乎寻常的努力和决心，他们于是感到惊慌。同这种残酷的目的展开竞赛，美国的形象在世界人士面前显得如何呢？……美国的活力、它的蓬勃的朝气、它的‘坚韧的弹性’是否足够坚韧？这是极其费解的问题。”这篇文章的作者承认：在两个制度的竞赛中，“美国确实渐渐不行了”。
    不仅如此，还有一个美国议员、前美国驻印度大使鲍尔斯，在展望六十年代的美国时，根据“过去十二年内使世界起了翻天覆地的变化的四种革命性的力量（即指亚非和拉丁美洲民族民主运动的高涨，苏联的强大发展、人民中国的兴起和武器技术方面的空前的革命）”，忧心忡忡地说：“如果说，我们（美国）在二十世纪六十年代的所作所为将决定这一代美国人或者甚至今后世世代代美国人的命运的话，我认为这样说并不过份。我们即将经受一次极重要的考验”。这就是说，短短五十年代的革命变化，已使美国资本主义制度的“命运”将在六十年代经受决定性考验。
    照鲍尔斯的说法，这个考验，或美国面临的“挑战”，不止是军事的、也不止是“狭隘的经济竞赛”，而是“直接接触到我们（美国）的民主社会的心脏。它是对我们的社会性质的最后的考验”。这样，鲍尔斯就比李普曼和“新闻周刊”的上述言论大大进了一步。美国变为二等国家，渐渐不行的变化，反映了资本主义制度的腐朽没落过程。
    上面所摘引的言论，是有代表性的。在美国，凡是不能不承认美国的世界地位急剧下降、对于两个制度的竞赛感到沮丧悲观的人，不管他们口头上怎样说，对世界形势的真实情况进行怎样的歪曲，但都不能不感觉到：美国面临的前景，是世界资本主义的末日越来越临近了。美国“基督教科学箴言报”记者哈希就说，在美国，“谈到将来，……连下面这一点也不能肯定：就是最近称做‘美国世纪’的东西将变得比‘美国的十年’长一些的东西”。一直怀抱着统治世界野心、狂妄地宣布“美国世纪”的美国资产阶级，现在连今后十年的时间会使美国发生怎么样的变化，都感到前途茫茫了。这又怎能不使美国资产阶级感到惊慌呢！
    正是因为这样，美国统治集团像猫头鹰害怕见太阳一样竭力回避接触这样的问题。艾森豪威尔对那些“对美国的制度表现出了令人震惊的悲观情绪”和“吵吵嚷嚷”者一律加以痛斥，听到有人谈论社会主义制度优越于资本主义制度，大骂这种看法是“狂妄”的。自然，艾森豪威尔所代表的统治集团是决不会认输的。患了所谓“自我批评狂”的资本主义卫士们，如鲍尔斯那样的人，也表示“衷心欢迎”艾森豪威尔在国情咨文中所提出的“各种说法”，认为“这些说法似乎反映出政府内的人正在日益了解我们（美国）必须加以对付的世界力量的幅度和深度”。而国情咨文正是美国统治集团对付这个声势浩大的“世界力量”的“战表”，它企图一边继续坚持“战争战略”，一边又采取所谓“和平战略”，来腐蚀、分化和麻痹争取和平和社会主义的力量；玩弄美元、大棒和挑拨的手段，镇压民族民主运动，争取时间，加紧备战，挽回军事颓势。从来的反动派都是不会自动退出历史舞台的，“困兽犹斗”正是他们的本色。
    但是，“威慑”“美元外交”和臭名远扬的“解放”政策，早已不是“妙手回春”之术，因为，它既然不能挽救美国陷于今天的没落局面，它也就不能阻止这个局面的日益恶化。美国统治集团不免“又急又烦恼”的原因正在于此。英国保守党的“每日邮报”驻纽约记者看到了美国的这个“病态”，但是对它的病根，他却只能摸到皮毛。他说，美国“习惯于在力量和能力方面居于第一位，所以那怕是一听到自己处于第二位也会气急起来”。实际上，这样的“习惯”和“气急”，决不是美国资产阶级所独有的怪僻。当“共产主义的怪影”在“欧洲游荡着”的时候，习惯于把压迫和剥削制度视为“神圣不可侵犯”的旧欧洲所有一切反动势力，就已气急起来了，都为驱除这个“怪影”而联合起来了。在当时，资产阶级的统治才真正是“居于第一位”的，但他们已在共产主义革命面前发抖了。当第一个社会主义国家在地球六分之一土地上兴起，资本主义“稳固”的纪元告终的时候，习惯于进行帝国主义大屠杀、瓜分殖民地和扼杀革命的旧欧洲一切反动势力和新兴的美国现代奴隶主，也气急起来了，都为武装干涉和封锁包围苏联而联合起来了。在当时，比起年青的社会主义苏联来，这一切反动势力也算得起是“居于第一位”的，但结果落得了更加可悲的局面。历史的进程就是这样地按照自己的规律演变的。
    是什么东西使得美国不再有信心而气急败坏了呢？英国“每日邮报”的记者显然是不能对这个问题提出真正的答案。大概是由于同病相怜吧，他以同情的口吻作出这样的结论：“至少病人自己知道生了病——这是恢复健康的第一步”。但是，英国保守党人多少年来就一直知道英国的资本主义制度生了什么病，却无法使它恢复健康，相反地是气息奄奄，日薄西山；那末，今天对他们的盎格鲁撒克逊族的盟主的安慰又能起什么作用呢。
    华尔街的垄断资本集团早已失掉了自己的春天，美国现在也只能颤抖在冬天里。
