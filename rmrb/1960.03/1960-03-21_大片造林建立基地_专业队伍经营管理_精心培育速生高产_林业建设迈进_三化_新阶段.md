Xinhua News Agency, 20th: National forestry construction has entered a new stage of forestry production basification, forestry management forest farmization, and forest cultivation high-yieldingization. In this spring's large-scale afforestation campaign, various regions have vigorously promoted forestry "three-izations," concentrating on large-scale afforestation and strengthening management, which has not only accelerated and increased the amount of afforestation but also greatly improved the quality of afforestation.

Building various forestry production bases on a large scale primarily involves constructing new large-scale timber forest bases throughout the country, especially in inland provinces. China's existing forests are mainly distributed in remote mountainous areas with inconvenient transportation. If new timber forest bases are not established in inland provinces, it will not only fail to solve the problem of uneven forest distribution and transportation difficulties but also fail to meet the growing needs of national construction. In the mass afforestation movement of the past few years, the Party and the state have paid attention to establishing new timber forest bases in southern provinces, mainly in mountainous and hilly areas south of the Yangtze River, to cultivate fast-growing and relatively valuable timber forests such as Chinese fir, bamboo, pine, Phoebe zhennan, eucalyptus, and casuarina. Now, many new Chinese fir and bamboo forests have grown up in the Miao Mountains of Guizhou, the Nanling Mountains of Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Guangxi, and the Tianmu Mountains of Zhejiang. The southern Chinese fir forest area has reached more than 100 million mu, and the bamboo forest area has reached more than 20 million mu. Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture in Guizhou Province and Jinlong Mountain in Huitong County, Hunan Province, will become new timber forest bases. On the basis of the two years of Great Leap Forward and the increasing consolidation of the people's communes, this year's forestry base construction is developing faster and more systematically. Guangdong, Sichuan, Yunnan, Fujian and other southern provinces are building large timber bases mainly with Chinese fir and economic forest bases mainly with oil-tea. The "Jinlong Mountain-style" forestry base in Hunan Province has developed from more than 800 last year to more than 3,500, with a total area of more than 8 million mu. Sichuan has also built more than 9,000 new timber forest bases and more than 6,000 economic forest bases. Forestry base construction in the sparsely forested areas of the North and in the people's communes has also been widely carried out. By the end of February, Shanxi Province had newly built more than 300 timber forest bases and 58 economic forests. Various parts of the Northwest have also established many timber forest bases in conjunction with soil and water conservation, sand prevention, and windbreak afforestation work. Coal mining areas in Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Anhui and other provinces have begun to build timber forests for mine props. The coal mining areas of Hebei and the two major coal mining areas of Huainan and Huaibei in Anhui have planted more than 2 million mu of mine prop forests. In order to change the uneven distribution of forests, the Northeast and Inner Mongolia are also using large areas of flat, fertile, and suitable afforestation land to build fast-growing and high-yielding forests mainly with poplar trees, establishing new bases for mine prop timber and papermaking timber.

The construction of forestry bases has greatly promoted the enthusiasm of various regions and people's communes to run forest farms on a large scale. According to statistics from the forestry department, the number of commune-run forest farms nationwide has increased from more than 20,000 last year to more than 50,000, and the number of state-owned forest farms mainly engaged in forestry has increased to more than 2,000. Compared with the total number of forest farms that have been built as of now and the end of last year, Guangdong Province has increased by about half, Sichuan Province has doubled, Heilongjiang Province has increased by more than three times, and Shandong has increased by nearly one time. At present, many special districts and counties in the above provinces have realized forest farmization.

Since the central task of forest farms is to achieve high-yielding forest trees, various regions have extensively summarized and promoted the experience of cultivating high-yielding forests this year. At present, the country's high-yielding forests have reached more than 20 million mu, and the growth rate of trees is about twice as fast as that of ordinary forests. Among them are Chinese fir, oil-tea, eucalyptus, paulownia, poplar, black locust, and various famous fruit trees. They are experimental fields and high-yielding plots in forestry production, which will greatly promote the rapid growth and high-yielding movement of trees.

Relevant departments pointed out that strengthening the leadership of the Party, relying on the people's communes, and relying on the broad masses are the guarantees for realizing basification, forest farmization, and high-yieldingization. Various regions are further implementing the "three-izations" of forestry construction, and rapidly pushing the high-speed development of forestry production to a higher stage.

    大片造林建立基地  专业队伍经营管理  精心培育速生高产
    林业建设迈进“三化”新阶段
    新华社20日讯　全国林业建设已经进入了林业生产基地化、林业经营林场化、林木培育丰产化的新阶段。在今春大规模造林运动中，各地大力推行林业“三化”，集中成片造林，加强了经营管理，不仅造得快、造得多，而且也大大地提高了造林质量。
    大建各种林业生产的基地，首先是要在全国各地、特别是内地各省大建新的大规模的用材林基地。我国现有森林主要分布在偏远高山地区，交通不便。如果不抓紧在内地各省区建立新的用材林基地，不仅不能解决森林分布不均、运输困难的问题，而且也无法满足国家建设日益增长的需要。几年来，在群众造林运动中，党和国家就注意了在南方各省区，主要是长江以南的山区和丘陵地区，建立新的用材林基地，大造杉木、竹林以及松、檫、桉、木麻黄等生长较快和比较珍贵的用材林。现在，贵州的苗岭、湖南、江西、广东、广西的南岭、浙江的天目山，许多新的杉木和竹林已经成长起来了。南方杉木林区已达一亿亩以上，毛竹林已达两千多万亩。贵州省黔东南苗族、侗族自治州、湖南省会同县的金龙山等，都将成为新的用材林基地。在两年大跃进和人民公社日益巩固的基础上，今年林业基地建设工作正在更快、更有计划地向前发展。南方广东、四川、云南、福建等省区大造以杉木为主的用材基地和以油茶为主的经济林基地。湖南省“金龙山式”的林业基地已经由去年的八百多处发展到三千五百多处，总面积八百多万亩。四川又新建用材林基地九千多处，经济林基地六千多处。北方林木稀少地区和人民公社的林业基地建设工作，也已经广泛展开。山西全省2月底已新造用材林基地三百多处，经济林五十八处。西北各地结合水土保持、防沙、防风造林工作也建立了不少用材林基地。辽宁、河北、山东、山西、安徽等省的煤矿区周围都已开始建造了矿柱用材林。河北各煤矿区和安徽淮南、淮北两大煤矿区已造矿柱林二百多万亩。东北和内蒙古为改变森林分布不均状况，也正利用大面积的平坦肥美宜林地，大造以杨树为主的速生丰产林，为矿柱用材和造纸用材建立新基地。
    建设林业基地大大推动了各地和人民公社大办林场的积极性。据林业部门的统计，全国社办林场已由去年的两万多个发展到五万多个，以营林为主的国营林场已发展到两千多处。以目前已建成的林场总数和去年年底相比，广东省增加了半倍左右，四川省增加了一倍，黑龙江省增加了三倍多，山东增加了近一倍。目前，上述各省已有不少专区和县实现了林场化。
    由于林场的中心任务是实现林木丰产化，今年各地大量总结推广了培育丰产林的经验。目前，全国的丰产林已达两千多万亩，林木的生长速度比一般林大约快一倍左右。其中有杉木、油茶、桉树、泡桐、杨树、洋槐，还有各种著名的果树等。它们是林业生产上的试验田、丰产方，将大大推动林木的速生高产运动。
    有关部门指出：加强党的领导，依靠人民公社，依靠广大群众，是实现基地化、林场化、丰产化的保证，各地正在进一步贯彻林业建设的“三化”，把林业生产的高速度发展，迅速推向一个更高的阶段。（附图片）
