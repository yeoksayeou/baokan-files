Xinhua News Agency, Dhaka, March 8th. The Chinese Exhibition Hall at the East Pakistan International Industrial Exposition in Dhaka has been visited by 500,000 people in the month since its opening.

Currently, Dhaka is in the rainy season, but visitors to the Chinese Pavilion remain very enthusiastic. Recent visitors include Amir Muhammad Khan, Chairman of the Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation; Mohammad Azam Khan, Director of the Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority; former Pakistani Prime Ministers Chundrigar and Suhrawardy; as well as many workers, farmers, business people, students, and housewives.

Amir Muhammad Khan said that the Chinese Pavilion shows China's "great achievements in all aspects." Former Prime Minister Suhrawardy said, "There are hundreds of things to see and praise, but nothing is greater than the Great Leap Forward in all aspects of a country's activities." An excited worker from the Dhaka Shipyard told the staff of the Chinese Exhibition Hall, "Such a country has emerged in Asia, capable of producing so many things, some of which are even better than those produced in the West. We Pakistanis are very happy about this."

Many visitors also inquired with the staff of the Chinese Exhibition Hall about China's industrial and agricultural situation, poetry and music, as well as ancient and modern Chinese history. One visitor even brought a tape recorder to the Chinese Exhibition Hall to record some Chinese music so they could take it home and enjoy it.

    观众热烈赞扬中国的巨大成就
    新华社达卡8日电　在达卡举行的东巴基斯坦国际工业博览会中的中国展览馆自从开幕以来的一个月中，已经有五十万人前往参观。
    目前达卡正处在雨季，但是中国馆的参观者仍然十分踊跃。最近前往参观的人当中包括巴基斯坦工业发展公司主席阿密尔·穆罕默德汗、巴基斯坦水利和电力发展管理局局长穆罕默德·阿扎姆汗、前巴基斯坦总理琼德里加和苏拉瓦底以及许多工人、农民、工商界人士、学生和家庭妇女等。
    阿密尔·穆罕默德汗说，中国馆显示了中国在“各方面所取得的巨大成就”。前总理苏拉瓦底说，“有成百件东西可以参观和值得赞扬，但是没有什么东西能够比一个国家各方面活动的大跃进更伟大。”达卡造船厂的一名工人激动地对中国展览馆的工作人员说，“这样一个国家已经在亚洲出现，它能够生产这样多的东西，其中有一些甚至比西方生产的更好。我们巴基斯坦人对此感到非常高兴。”
    许多参观者还向中国展览馆的工作人员询问了关于中国的工农业情况、诗歌和音乐以及中国古代和现代的历史等。一个参观者甚至带了一个录音机到中国展览馆来，要求录下某些中国的音乐，以便带回家里欣赏。
