They No Longer Revolve Around the Cooking Pot!
Shanghai Yongda Dyeing and Weaving Factory Film Review Group

    The color feature film “Thousands of Purples and Reds are Always Spring,” with its novel style, is a film with realistic educational significance.

    The most valuable enlightenment and education the film gives us is that the Party has thoroughly liberated women and that the Party guides women to the happiest path; at the same time, it fully demonstrates the strong desire and great power of the broad masses of women to consciously organize themselves and participate in socialist construction under the education of the Party. The film intimately embodies this point through the stories of Dai Mama, the director of the Jixiangli Residents' Committee and an old Communist Party member, and Cai Feng, Gui Zhen, A Feng and other three different types of housewives.

    Women must get rid of housework, realize the socialization of housework, and actively participate in productive labor to achieve complete liberation. This is also the case in reality. Through the production team, Jixiangli has established social welfare undertakings and production organizations such as public canteens, nurseries, sewing groups, and toy factories, fundamentally solving the contradiction between women's participation in social production and managing housework, thereby further liberating women's labor force, enabling women to regularly participate in social activities and learn cultural technologies. After women participate in labor, they gain economic independence and completely get rid of their subordinate status in the family. The significant change in Gui Zhen's relationship with her husband after she participated in production illustrates this point.

    Due to their participation in social labor and collective life, the spiritual outlook of the broad masses of women has also undergone profound changes. In the past, they were confined to small circles, short-sighted, and narrow-minded; today, they have become energetic, open-minded, and their political awareness has also improved rapidly, and they have also mastered culture and technology. Like the sewing production team in the film, in order to let the orphans participating in production and construction in remote areas wear cotton clothes as soon as possible, they gave full play to their spirit of cooperation and made a rush to sew them. When the orphans wrote letters to them from distant Lanzhou, expressing their warmest respect to them, they felt incomparable joy, just as they said: "We have also contributed to socialist construction."

    Our beloved Party is building bridges and paving roads for the vast number of women across the country, allowing liberated women to spread their wings and fly, flying farther and farther, higher and higher.

    The film "Thousands of Purples and Reds are Always Spring" will further encourage the broad masses of the audience to plunge into the heated technical revolution and cultural revolution movement, and spread their wings and fly high to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

    风格新颖的彩色故事片“万紫千红总是春”是一部具有现实教育意义的影片。
    影片给我们最珍贵的启示教育，是党使妇女们得到了彻底解放，是党指引妇女走向最幸福的道路；同时充分显示出广大妇女在党的教育下，自觉要求组织起来参加社会主义建设的强烈愿望和巨大力量。影片通过吉祥里居民委员会主任、老共产党员戴妈妈和彩凤、桂贞、阿凤等三个不同类型的家庭妇女之间的故事，亲切地体现了这一点。
    妇女要彻底解放必须摆脱家务劳动，实现家务劳动社会化，积极参加生产劳动。事实也是这样。吉祥里通过生产组，办起了公共食堂、托儿所、缝纫组、玩具厂等社会福利事业和生产组织，根本上解决了妇女参加社会生产和料理家务的矛盾，从而进一步解放妇女劳动力，使妇女能够经常参加社会活动和学习文化技术。妇女参加劳动后，经济上得到了独立，完全摆脱家庭中的从属地位。如桂贞参加生产后，和丈夫关系的显著变化就说明了这一点。
    广大妇女由于参加社会劳动和集体生活，精神面貌随着也发生了深刻的变化。过去她们局限在小圈子里，眼界短浅，胸怀狭窄；今天，变得精力充沛、思想开朗、政治觉悟提高得也很快，也掌握了文化和技术。像影片中缝纫生产组为了及早让参加边远地区生产建设的孤儿们穿上棉衣，她们发挥了协作精神，突击缝制。当孤儿们从遥远的兰州写信给她们，向她们致最亲切的敬意时，她们感到无比的喜悦，正如她们所说的：“我们也为社会主义建设尽了一份力量。”
    我们亲爱的党，为全国广大妇女架桥铺路，让解放了的妇女们展翅飞翔，愈飞愈远，愈飞愈高。
    “万紫千红总是春”这部影片将更进一步鼓舞广大观众，投入热火朝天的技术革命和文化革命运动中，为实现今年更大更好更全面的跃进而展翅高飞。
