    Ensure the Continued Leap Forward and Technological Transformation of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry
    Vigorously Train Various Technical Personnel
    (Based on our report) In order to ensure the continued leap forward of agriculture and animal husbandry and gradually complete the technological transformation of agriculture and animal husbandry, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is now vigorously training various agricultural and animal husbandry technical personnel in accordance with the Party's educational policy and the "walking on two legs" method.
    According to incomplete statistics, from last winter to mid-February this year, various banners, counties, and people's communes in rural and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas throughout the region have combined with spring plowing activities, using methods such as running short-term training classes, on-site meetings, summarizing experience, and apprenticeships, to train more than 13,500 various farmer technicians. It is estimated that the region will train 60,000 to 100,000 farmer technicians this year. In order to promote the technological transformation of agriculture and animal husbandry, accelerate the realization of agricultural mechanization, and strengthen the technical force, the autonomous region will build two new agricultural mechanization schools, two agricultural and animal husbandry schools, a driver training class, and expand three tractor driving schools this year. A state-owned reclamation farm school will also be planned this year. The autonomous region's state-owned farm and ranch system will also train more than 2,000 tractor drivers this year to greatly improve its level of mechanization. Massively training production management and financial management personnel for people's communes is an important measure to consolidate and improve people's communes. This year, people's communes in the autonomous region will train 120,000 to 140,000 such personnel.
    In terms of animal husbandry, the region has trained 280 tractor drivers, combine harvester drivers, and other mechanical personnel. In order to meet the semi-mechanization and mechanization of animal husbandry in the future, state-owned ranches, grassland mechanical grass cultivation stations, and pastoral people's communes on major grasslands are equipping mechanical production teams, tractor and automobile driving and repair personnel with two sets of personnel, using the method of master-apprentice and learning by doing to train a large number of drivers and mechanical personnel of various ethnic groups. Recently, various parts of the autonomous region have also trained more than 13,700 disease prevention personnel and lambing personnel for animal husbandry, which provides an important technical force for better strengthening livestock breeding management and animal disease prevention and control this year.

    确保农牧业持续跃进和技术改造
    大力培养各种技术人材
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区为确保农牧业的持续跃进和逐步完成对农牧业的技术改造，现正根据党的教育方针和“两条腿走路”的方法，大力培养各种农牧业技术人材。
    据不完全统计，从去年冬天到今年2月中旬，全区农村和半农半牧区的各旗、县和人民公社，已结合备耕活动，用大办短期训练班、现场会议、总结经验和师傅带徒弟等办法，培养出各种农民技术员一万三千五百多人，预计今年全区将培养出农民技术员六万人到十万人。为促进农牧业技术改造、加快农牧业机械化的实现和壮大技术队伍，今年自治区将新建两所农业机械化学校、两所农牧学校、一所汽车驾驶员训练班和扩建三所拖拉机驾驶学校。今年还将筹建一所农垦学校。自治区国营农牧场系统，今年也将训练二千多名拖拉机驾驶员，以大力提高其机械化水平。大量培养人民公社的生产管理和财务管理人员，是巩固和提高人民公社的重要措施，今年自治区各人民公社将培养这样的人材达十二万到十四万人。
    在畜牧业方面，全区已培养出二百八十名拖拉机、联合收割机驾驶员和其他机务人员。为了迎接今后畜牧业的半机械化和机械化，各大草原上的国营牧场、草原机械育草站和牧区人民公社，正为机械生产队、拖拉机和汽车的驾驶修配人员，配备两套人马，用师傅带徒弟和边学边做的方法，大量培训着各民族的驾驶员和机务人员。最近自治区各地又为畜牧业训练了一万三千七百多名防疫员和接羔员，这为今年更好地加强牲畜的饲养管理和兽疫防治工作，提供了重要技术力量。
