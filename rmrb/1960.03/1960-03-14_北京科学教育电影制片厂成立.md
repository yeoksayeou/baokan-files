Xinhua News Agency, March 13th: The Beijing Science Education Film Studio was officially established on the 12th.

　　This film studio was formed by merging the Science Education Film Production Section of the original "August First" Film Studio, the Capital Education Film Studio of Beijing Normal University, and the photography group of the Health Education Institute affiliated with the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau. These three units, with limited personnel, poor conditions, and a lack of equipment, have already produced around 100 science, education, and popular health knowledge films, such as "Hydraulic Coal Mining." The Beijing Science Education Film Studio will carry forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, hard work, and ingenuity. Adhering to the principle of combining popularization and improvement, and the method of simultaneous production, construction, and cadre training, it will closely cooperate with industrial and agricultural production, as well as the technological and cultural revolutions. It will collaborate with various relevant departments and units to create a large number of popular science films, technology promotion films, scientific research films, and teaching films that are rich in ideology and scientific content, in order to meet the urgent need for knowledge of socialist construction and the broad masses of people.

　　On the evening of the 12th, the entire staff of this film studio held an inaugural meeting. Wang Kunlun, Vice Mayor of Beijing, Gao Ge, Deputy Minister of the Cultural Department of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, and Situ Huimin, Deputy Director of the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture, all spoke at the meeting. Heads of film enterprises and institutions in the capital went to congratulate them.
