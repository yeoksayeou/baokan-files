    Paving the Way for Developing Mountainous Areas' Economy
    Transportation in Mountainous Areas of Fujian Extends in All Directions
    (Our Dispatch) The mountainous areas of Fujian, known as "Mountains of Treasures," are rapidly changing their backward transportation situation. Currently, a land and water transportation network in the mountainous areas is gradually forming, with railways such as the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway and major highway lines, as well as the Minjiang and Jiulongjiang rivers, serving as the main arteries, and countless simple roads, tracks, and cableways serving as the branches. The development of transportation has paved the way for the high-speed development of the rich mountainous economy. Last year alone, the volume of major materials transported in major mountainous areas such as northern Fujian, eastern Fujian, western Fujian, and southern Fujian, including timber, bamboo, grain, agricultural and sideline products, minerals, and coal, reached more than 25 million tons, an increase of more than 50% compared to 1958, and more than 20 times the total freight volume of the province in 1950. In the first month of this year, the short-distance transportation volume in various regions increased by nearly 20% compared to December of last year.
    In the past, the province did not have a single railway, and the barely passable highways totaled only 940 kilometers. The navigable mileage of rivers was also very short, which seriously affected the political, economic, and cultural development of the mountainous areas. A folk song circulated here: "The mountains are high, the mountains are long, climbing over the ridges makes you call out to your parents. Everything is carried on your back, and half a lifetime is spent on the road." After liberation, under the care and leadership of the Party and the government, the broad masses of people in the mountainous areas vigorously developed transportation construction while developing mountainous production. Especially since the communization, the people's communes in various places have more planned and organizedly launched mass movements for transportation construction. In addition to the state investing in and being responsible for the construction of major transportation arteries such as railways, highways, and waterways, the communes, in close cooperation with forestry, transportation, and other departments, have built simple roads, simple railways, overhead cableways, chutes, tracks, mountain roads, and other short-distance transportation lines, thereby achieving high-speed development of transportation construction in the mountainous areas. Now, in addition to the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway and other main lines, more than 20 branch lines and dedicated lines connecting to the main lines have been built in the forest areas, as well as more than 120 kilometers of light railways; the highways open to traffic in various places have reached more than 10,000 kilometers, an increase of more than ten times compared to the early days of liberation, and more than 80% of the communes have access to automobiles. The navigable mileage (for steamers and wooden sailboats) of various rivers has increased from more than 3,000 kilometers in the early days of liberation to more than 4,600 kilometers. At the same time, 50,000 to 60,000 kilometers of mountain roads, wooden tracks, chutes, and overhead cableways have been built, making the vast mountainous areas appear with a new look of "trains穿山跨水, automobiles straight up to the clouds, boats shuttling back and forth, and avenues spreading throughout the mountains."
    With the formation and continuous development of the mountainous transportation network, a large number of timber and various forest and sideline products in many remote mountainous areas have been greatly developed. The volume of timber has increased thirty-one times from 250,000 cubic meters in the early days of liberation. The timber production in 1959 was 3.5 million cubic meters, and the output of bamboo and various other agricultural, forestry, and local specialties has also increased dramatically, powerfully supporting the construction and people's lives in the province and other regions, prospering the mountainous economy, and improving the living standards of the broad masses.

    为开发山区经济铺平道路
    福建山区交通四通八达
    本报讯　被人誉为“万宝山”的福建山区，交通闭塞的面貌正在迅速改变。目前，一个以鹰厦等铁路和各公路干线、闽江、九龙江等水陆交通大动脉为骨干，以无数条简易公路、轨道、索道等为支线的山区水陆交通运输线已逐步形成。交通事业的发展，为高速度开发富饶的山区经济铺平了道路。去年一年，仅闽北、闽东、闽西和闽南等各主要山区运输的木材、毛竹、粮食、农副土特产、矿石、煤炭等几种主要物资即达二千五百多万吨，超过1958年50％以上，等于1950年全省货运量的二十多倍。今年第一个月里，单是各地短途运输量比去年12月份增长近20％。
    过去，全省没有一条铁路，勉强通车的公路只有九百四十多公里，江河能通行轮船的里程也很短，严重地影响了山区政治、经济、文化的发展。这里流传着这样的歌谣：“山岭高，山岭长，爬行超岭喊爹娘，件件东西用背背，半世工夫跑路上。”解放以后，在党和政府关怀和领导下，广大山区人民在发展山区生产同时，还大力发展山区交通建设。尤其是公社化以来，各地人民公社更有计划、有组织地掀起群众性交通建设热潮。除由国家投资负责修建主要铁路、公路、航道等交通干线外，还以公社为主，同林业、交通等部门大协作，大建简易公路、简易铁路和架空索道、滑道、轨道、山间大道等各种短途运输线，从而使山区交通建设获得高速度发展。现在全省除了鹰厦铁路等干线以外，在林区修建了二十多条和干线相接连的支线和专用线，还有一百二十多公里轻便铁路；各地通车的公路已达一万多公里，比解放初期增加十倍多，有80％以上的公社都通了汽车。各江河通航（轮船、木帆船）里程由解放初期三千多公里发展到四千六百多公里。同时还修建了五、六万公里的山间大道、木轨道、滑道和架空索道等，使广大山区出现了“火车穿山跨水，汽车直上云端，船只往来如梭，大道遍布山间”的新面貌。
    随着山区交通网的形成和不断发展，许多偏僻山区的大批木材和各种林副土特产得到大量开发。木材比解放初期的二十五万立方米猛增三十一倍。1959年的木材产量为三百五十万立方米，毛竹和其他各种农、林、土特产的产量也都一跃再跃，有力地支援了省内以及外地建设和人民生活的需要，繁荣了山区经济，提高了广大群众的生活水平。
