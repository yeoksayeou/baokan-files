Time is a Priceless Treasure
Zhang Zhao, Xu Shijie

"An inch of time is worth an inch of gold, but you can't buy back an inch of time with an inch of gold." The ancients often used such words to describe the preciousness of time, advising people to cherish it. The reason why people value time so much is that the creation of any material and spiritual wealth requires time. Marx once said: "The less time society requires to produce wheat, livestock, etc., the more time it has for other production—material and spiritual production. Whether it is an individual or society, the comprehensiveness of its development, needs, and activities is determined by saving time. All savings ultimately boil down to saving time."
("Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin on Communist Society," p. 67) Time is simply a priceless treasure for mankind.

The Chinese people, especially the working people, fully understand the importance of time. They cherish time and strive for time in every way. They have long hoped to change the poor and backward face of our country with their own hands, so that they and their descendants can live a happy life. However, in old China before liberation, because the means of production and ruling power were in the hands of a few exploiters and oppressors, the people were not masters of time, but only slaves of time. Although time existed equally for them, they could not control time according to their own will, but had to obey all kinds of masters—warlords, bureaucrats, landlords, capitalists, and comprador classes, and the wealth they created was almost all taken away. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, after a long and arduous struggle, did the Chinese people overthrow the "three great mountains" that weighed on them, establish a new China in which the people are masters of their own affairs, and only then did they get rid of their fate as beasts of burden and become masters of time for the first time.

This is a great transformation. It has made the light and heat buried in the depths of people's hearts for centuries burst out. People have shown unprecedented initiative and enthusiasm, whether in the struggle to eliminate the remaining reactionary forces and further transform the relations of production, or in the battle to transform nature. People are using time most effectively and saving time to the greatest extent. Therefore, we have not only quickly completed the restoration of the national economy, but also basically completed the socialist transformation of a large Eastern country with hundreds of millions of people, which has world significance, in just seven years. Especially in 1958, when the Chinese people, after the great nationwide rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, further raised their ideological consciousness, broke superstitions, and liberated their minds, everyone's energy was soaring and everyone was in high spirits. Under the guidance of the general line of socialist construction formulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and encouraged by the slogan of catching up with Britain in the output of major industrial products in fifteen years, ten years, or even less, in order to accelerate the change of our country's "poor and blank" state, people in all walks of life are speeding up and determined to race against time at a faster speed, determined to catch up with time and put time completely under their control. As a result, from the countryside to the cities, from the inland to the border areas, a tense battle to seize every minute and second immediately unfolded. People no longer calculate their work by the day, month, or year, but by the hour, minute, and second. This tense battle for every minute and second has yielded extremely rich fruits. By the end of 1959, the main indicators of our country's Second Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy had been completed three years ahead of schedule. We really ran further ahead of time! We won another great victory in the race against time!

What does it mean to complete the Second Five-Year Plan three years ahead of schedule? This means that we have won another three years of time in the high-speed socialist construction. Three years may seem like a brief moment in human history, not worth special cherishing; but for our heroic people with soaring energy, who are unwilling to easily let go of even an inch of time, that is too precious. A minute, that is insignificant, but in a minute, the weft of a modern textile machine flies back and forth between the warp two hundred times, and the main shaft of a new lathe turns three thousand revolutions, and every rotation of the machine means that new wealth is being created. A day is twenty-four hours, an hour is sixty minutes, and three years, calculated by a common year, is one thousand and ninety-five days. How many "minutes" are there in total? In these many "minutes," all the machines in the country are running and all the people with labor power are in action. How much wealth will this create? And it should be understood that the greater the enthusiasm of the people, the higher the labor efficiency, and the greater the value created per minute. Comparing the output of industrial production in China in August 1959 with that in 1949, the output of steel per minute increased from 0.3 tons to 25 tons, iron increased from 0.5 tons to 37 tons, coal increased from 61.7 tons to 606 tons, and cotton cloth increased from 10,000 feet to 36,000 feet... There is no doubt that in the next three years, due to the further boosting of the masses' energy, labor productivity will increase faster than in the past ten years, and the wealth created will certainly be greater. We have complete confidence in this. Because in our miraculous era and country, the number of people who catch up with time is not decreasing, but increasing. For example, the Zhang Jiazhong forging group of Xuzhou Heavy Machinery Factory, by developing the spirit of hard work plus skillful work, actively creating and improving tools, completed nearly thirteen years of work in one year, and by the end of 1959, they were already doing the work of 1977. The Ma Hengchang group of Qiqihar No. 2 Machine Tool Factory has been leaping forward year after year, completing seventeen years and nine months of work in seven years. In the next three years, how many advanced collectives and advanced individuals like Zhang Jiazhong and Ma Hengchang groups will emerge! All this shows that in the era of the Great Leap Forward, the three years we have won mean ten times or even a hundred times more time than the usual meaning of three years, and we have won ten times or even a hundred times higher speed than in the past. How great the value of such three years is, it cannot be measured by gold, but by the most precious things in the world.

For the Chinese people who are eager to change the face of "poverty and blankness," time is so precious, and all our work boils down to a race against time. Then, does everyone cherish time and make full use of it? We say that the vast majority of people are like this, otherwise there would be no continuous two years of the Great Leap Forward; but there are also a few people who are not like this. One type of people are the so-called rule-followers, who advocate taking things slowly, and a day's work must be completed in one day. They are never willing to use their brains more or think of more ways to dig out their potential, and they only use half a day or even less to complete it. The characteristic of this kind of people is that they stick to conventions and lack the spirit of bold innovation and bold creation that dares to think, speak, and act. Therefore, their work is always ordinary. There is also a type of people who have developed a habit of procrastination, perfunctorily fulfilling their responsibilities when things happen, pushing what can be pushed, and dragging what can be dragged. A day's work often takes two days, three days, or even more to complete. The characteristic of this kind of people is that they lack vigor and are full of old age. They are content with the status quo and do not seek to improve. Therefore, their work falls far behind time. These two types of people are what we usually call "settling in the middle reaches" and "willing to settle in the lower reaches." As the wave of the Great Leap Forward gets higher and higher, although such people are becoming fewer and fewer, they have not completely disappeared.

Two completely opposite attitudes towards time reflect two completely opposite worldviews and outlooks on life. Those who seize every minute and second and stand in the ranks of the Great Leap Forward have a firm proletarian stand and a clear dialectical materialist worldview. They have a sincere heart to serve the cause of the people. They are not only distressed by the weakness and poverty of the Chinese people for more than a hundred years and try their best to change this situation, but also have lofty goals and are determined to realize the most beautiful ideal of mankind in China and then in the world—to build a communist society. They understand that it is the inevitable law of human social development to reach socialism and communism through capitalism; and to build a communist paradise on earth, it all depends on people's conscious efforts. They understand that although time is infinite, a person's life is finite, so they try to save time, strive for time, and use time most fully and effectively, never letting time pass in vain, and try every means to shorten our journey to communism. They shouted the heroic slogan of "asking steel from time" and "asking grain from time"; they work and labor day and night, and one by one they have become Kuafu chasing the sun, leaping forward at a high speed of "one day equals twenty years," "taking five steps in two steps." Their attitude towards time is completely positive and enterprising, fully demonstrating their noble qualities of loyalty to the proletarian cause, and also reflecting their heroic spirit of the proletariat transforming nature and transforming society. And those who settle in the middle reaches, or even are willing to settle in the lower reaches, who do not actively strive for time, or even waste time, mainly have not solved or have not completely solved the problems of worldview and outlook on life. Generally speaking, they are also willing to make revolution, and have more or less done some work for the revolution, but because they are always unwilling to abandon the interests of the small self and unwilling to completely integrate themselves with the revolution and the people, they lack sufficient enthusiasm for the cause of the revolution. They are short-sighted, lack the lofty ambitions of communism, only see the immediate interests, and do not see that we have a more distant and more beautiful prospect, so it is easy to be overwhelmed by victory and become complacent. They lack the idea of continuous revolution, do not look at problems from the point of view of development, but regard things as isolated, static, and unchanging. They are afraid of difficulties, bow to difficulties, and do not understand the truth that things are done by people and people will conquer nature. All these factors added together make them dislike speeding up and prefer slow ox carts; dislike high speed and prefer low speed. They hope to work steadily and make revolution comfortably. Not only are some things that can be done through effort, they are unwilling to work hard to do because they are afraid of taking risks and suffering hardships; but even some things that can be done completely, they do much slower than others. This kind of person's attitude towards time is negative. In their opinion, a day is twenty-four hours, and it is impossible to equal twenty years at all. They not only lack the heroic spirit of the proletariat racing against time and striving to be the master of time, but also more or less reflect the decadent bourgeois thoughts and feelings in their bodies. Marx once said: "History does nothing, it 'does not possess any infinite abundance', it 'does not fight in any battles'! It is not 'history' that creates all this, possesses all this and fights for all this, but precisely man, real, living man. 'History' is not some special personality that uses man as a tool to achieve its own purposes. History is nothing but the activity of man pursuing his own purposes." ("Complete Works of Marx and Engels" Volume 2, p. 118) Comrade Mao Zedong also said: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Volume 3, p. 1031) It can be seen that in the long river of time, that is, in the development of history, its master is the masses of the people. We hope that our socialist revolution and socialist construction fighters, who are the masters of time, will hold higher the red flags of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune, give fuller play to subjective initiative, those who are in front should advance and advance again, and those who are behind should catch up quickly. Let us all join hands to break through all difficulties and obstacles, strive for time, and strive for high speed, so that we can write more majestic and magnificent historical chapters in the 1960s.

    时间是无价之宝
    张钊　徐士杰
    “一寸光阴一寸金，寸金难买寸光阴”，古人常用这样的话来形容时间的可贵，劝告人们要十分珍惜时间。人们所以把时间看得这样重要，是因为任何物质和精神财富的创造，都需要时间。马克思曾经说过：“社会用来生产小麦和牲畜等等所需要的时间愈少，用来进行其他的生产——物质和精神的生产的时间就愈多。无论是个人，无论是社会，其发展、需求和活动的全面性，都是由节约时间来决定的。一切节省，归根到底都归结为时间的节省。”
  （“马克思恩格斯列宁斯大林论共产主义社会”第67页）时间，对于人类来说，简直是无价之宝。
    我国人民，特别是劳动人民，是完全懂得时间的重要性的。他们爱惜时间，处处争取时间，早就希望用自己的双手改变我国贫穷落后的面貌，使自己和子孙后代过幸福的生活。然而在解放前的旧中国，由于生产资料和统治权力掌握在少数剥削者和压迫者的手里，人民不是时间的主人，而只能是时间的奴隶。时间，虽然一视同仁地对他们存在着，但是他们不能按照自己的意志支配时间，必须听命于各种各样的主人——军阀、官僚、地主、资本家和买办阶级，他们创造的财富几乎都被夺走了。只是在中国共产党的领导下，我国人民经过长期的艰苦的奋斗，推翻了压在自己身上的“三座大山”，建立了由人民自己当家作主的新中国，他们才摆脱了作牛作马的奴隶命运，第一次变成了时间的主人。
    这是一个伟大的转变。它使多少世纪以来就埋藏在人们内心深处的光和热迸发出来了，人们无论在肃清残余的反动势力和进一步改造生产关系的斗争中，或者在改造大自然的战斗中，都表现了从未有过的积极性和主动性。人们最有成效地利用着时间，最大限度地节省着时间。因此，我们不但很快完成了国民经济的恢复工作，而且在短短的七年里，就在一个有着数亿人口的东方大国基本上完成了具有世界意义的社会主义改造。特别是在1958年，当我国人民经过伟大的全民整风运动和反右派斗争，进一步提高了思想觉悟，破除了迷信，解放了思想，更是人人干劲冲天，个个意气风发，人民群众的积极性和主动性空前地高涨了起来。在党中央和毛主席制订的社会主义建设总路线的指引下，在十五年、十年或者更短的时间内在主要工业产品的产量方面赶上英国的口号的鼓舞下，为了加速改变我国“一穷二白”的面貌，各行各业的人们都快马加鞭，决心用更快的速度和时间赛跑，决心赶到时间的前面去，把时间完全置于自己的控制之下。于是，从农村到城市，从内地到边疆，立即展开了争分夺秒的紧张战斗，人们不再是按日、按月、按年，而是按时、按分、按秒来计算自己的工作。这种分秒必争的紧张战斗，结下了极其丰硕的果实，到1959年底，我国发展国民经济的第二个五年计划的主要指标已经提前三年完成了。我们果然更远地跑到时间的前面了！我们在和时间赛跑中又打了一个大胜仗！
    提前三年完成第二个五年计划，这是什么意思呢？这就是说，我们在高速度的社会主义建设中又赢得了三年的时间。三年，这在人类的历史上不过是短暂的一刻，似乎不值得特别加以珍惜；但是对于具有冲天干劲、连寸阴也不肯轻易放过的我国英雄人民，那就太宝贵了。一分钟，这是微乎其微的吧，然而在一分钟里，一部现代化的纺织机的纬线在经线之间飞穿二百次，一部新式车床的主轴要转三千转，而机器的每一转动，就意味着新的财富被创造出来。一天是二十四小时，一小时是六十分，三年按平年算是一千零九十五天，一共该有多少个“一分”呢？在这多少个“一分”里，全国所有的机器都开动起来，所有有劳动力的人都行动起来，这将创造出多少财富呢？而且应该懂得，人民群众的干劲愈大，劳动效率就愈高，每分钟创造的价值就愈大。拿我国1959年8月份工业生产的产量同1949年相比，每分钟产钢从零点三吨提高到二十五吨，铁从零点五吨提高到三十七吨，煤从六十一点七吨提高到六百零六吨，棉布从一万尺提高到三点六万尺……。毫无疑问，在今后的三年中，由于群众进一步鼓足干劲，劳动生产率将会比过去的十年提高得更快，创造的财富一定会更多。对于这一点，我们是完全有信心的。因为在我们这个出奇迹的时代和国家中，赶到时间前面去的人不是愈来愈少，而是愈来愈多。例如，徐州重型机械厂掌家忠锻工小组，由于发扬了苦干加巧干的精神，积极地创制和改进工具，一年完成了将近十三年的工作量，1959年底就已经在干1977年的活了。齐齐哈尔第二机床厂马恒昌小组年年跃进，七年完成了十七年零九个月的工作量。在今后的三年里，又该出现多少个掌家忠、马恒昌小组这样的先进集体和先进人物啊！这些都说明，在大跃进的时代里，我们赢得了三年，就是赢得了比平常意义的三年要多十倍以至百倍的时间，就是赢得了比过去高十倍乃至百倍的速度。这样三年的时间有多么大的价值，不用金子，而用世界上最宝贵的东西也是无法衡量的。
    对于迫切要求改变“一穷二白”面貌的我国人民，时间是这样的可贵，我们的一切工作归根结底都是和时间赛跑，那末，是不是每一个人都十分珍惜时间，都充分地利用了时间呢？我们说，绝大多数人是这样，否则就不可能有连续两年的大跃进；但是也还有少数人不是这样。一种人是所谓按部就班论者，他们遇事主张慢慢来，一天的工作一定要一天完成，绝不肯多动脑筋，多想办法，挖尽自己的潜力，只用半天甚至更短的时间就把它作完。这种人的特点是墨守成规，缺乏敢想敢说敢干的大胆革新和大胆创造的精神，因此他们的工作总是平平淡淡。还有一种人则是拖拉已经成习，遇事敷衍塞责，能推的就推，能拖的就拖，一天的工作经常要两天、三天甚至更多的时间才能作完。这种人的特点是朝气不足，而暮气却很浓厚，安于现状，不求上进，因此他们的工作远远地落到了时间的后面。这两种人，就是我们通常说的“安居中游”和“甘居下游”的人们，随着大跃进的浪头愈来愈高，这样的人虽然愈来愈少，但是还没有完全绝迹。
    对待时间的两种截然相反的态度，反映了两种完全对立的世界观和人生观。那些分秒必争、站在大跃进行列中的人们，有着坚定的无产阶级的立场，有着明确的辩证唯物主义的世界观。他们有一颗赤诚地为人民的事业服务的心，不但为百余年来我国人民的积弱和贫困而苦恼，极力想改变这种状况，而且目标远大，立志要在我国并进而在全世界实现人类最美好的理想——建立共产主义社会。他们懂得，经由资本主义而到达社会主义和共产主义，这是人类社会发展的必然规律；而要在人间建立起共产主义的天堂，全靠人们自觉的努力。他们懂得，虽然时间是无限的，但是人的一生则是有限的，因而他们尽量节省时间，争取时间，最充分、最有效地利用时间，绝不让光阴虚度，千方百计地缩短我们通向共产主义的途程。他们喊出了“向时间要钢铁”、“向时间要粮食”的豪迈口号；他们夜以继日地工作着、劳动着，一个个变成了逐日的夸父，以“一天等于二十年”的高速度飞跃前进，“五步并作两步走”。他们对待时间的态度完全是积极的，进取的，充分表现了他们忠于无产阶级事业的高贵品质，同时也反映了他们具有无产阶级改造自然、改造社会的英雄气概。而那些安居中游，甚至甘居下游，不是积极争取时间，甚至浪费时间的人们，主要是还没有解决或没有完全解决世界观和人生观的问题。一般地说，他们也是愿意革命的，而且或多或少地为革命作过一些工作，但是由于他们始终不肯抛弃小我的利益，不肯把自己完全和革命、和人民融合起来，因而对革命的事业缺少足够的热情。他们目光短浅，没有共产主义的雄心大志，只看见眼前的利益，看不见我们还有更远大、更美好的前景，因而很容易被胜利冲昏头脑，变得自满自足起来。他们缺乏不断革命的思想，不是从发展的观点看问题，而是把事物看成孤立的静止不变的。他们害怕困难，向困难低头，不懂得事在人为、人定胜天的道理。所有这些因素加起来，就使得他们不喜欢快马加鞭，而喜欢老牛拖车；不喜欢高速度，而喜欢低速度。他们希望安安稳稳地工作，舒舒服服地革命，不但一些经过努力能够作到的事，他们因为怕冒风险、怕吃苦头不肯努力去作；而且就是一些完全能办到的事，他们办起来也要比别人慢得多。这种人对待时间的态度是消极的，在他们看来，一天就是二十四小时，根本不可能等于二十年。他们不但没有无产阶级和时间赛跑，力争作时间主人的英雄气概，而且在他们的身上或多或少地反映了没落的资产阶级思想感情。马克思曾经说过：“历史什么事情也没有做，它‘并不拥有任何无穷尽的丰富性’，它并‘没有在任何战斗中作战’！创造这一切、拥有这一切并为这一切而斗争的，不是‘历史’，而正是人，现实的、活生生的人。‘历史’并不是把人当作达到自己目的的工具来利用的某种特殊的人格。历史不过是追求着自己目的的人的活动而已。”（“马克思恩格斯全集”第二卷第118页）毛泽东同志也说过：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”（“毛泽东选集”第三卷，第1031页）可见在时间的长河中，也就是在历史的发展中，它的主人是人民群众。我们希望作为时间主人的我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的战士们，都更高地举起总路线、大跃进和人民公社的红旗，更充分地发挥主观能动性，走在前面的要前进再前进，走在后面的要急起直追，大家共同携起手来，冲破一切困难障碍，力争时间，力争高速度，让我们在六十年代写下更加威武雄伟的历史篇章。
