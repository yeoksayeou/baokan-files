According to a report in the New Hunan Daily, in the midst of the great upsurge of technical innovation and technical revolution, Comrade Teng Shuyou, the secretary of the Waterborne Party Branch of the Hongjiang Transportation People's Commune in the Qianyang Special Zone, created a "mast-tied buoyancy loading method" that can increase the load capacity of wooden sailboats by about 20%. The operation is very simple: after the boat is unloaded, use old cable (or lead wire) to tie two masts to the sides of the boat (with the mast tips pointing in the same direction as the bow), about 2 decimeters above the water surface. After the boat body sinks under load, most of the masts are immersed in the water, and a portion floats on the surface. In this way, the water resistance is hardly increased, but the buoyancy of the water is increased, thereby expanding the boat's load capacity. Later, the employees of the Mayang Transportation Commune further improved the method of tying the masts of two boats to only one boat. They used waste boat materials to make floating boards (the same length as the boat body, generally using two boards about 4-5 inches wide and 1 inch thick) tied to the sides of the boat, which can also serve the same function as mast tying. This advanced loading method has been promoted in an all-round way among more than 29,000 tons of wooden sailboats in the Yuanshui River basin with the advocacy of the Qianyang Special Administrative Office Transportation Bureau.

The advantages of this loading method are: shallow draft, fast speed, and large load. After tying experiments on large and small sailboats, the load capacity is generally increased by about 20%. Because its draft is shallower than ordinary boats, its speed is faster than ordinary boats. When passing shoals, it is possible to avoid or reduce towing, and speed up sailing. Secondly, the tied boat increases the contact area between the hull and the water, which can make the boat sail more smoothly and safely; when it collides with rocks and obstacles, it can protect the hull. This loading method does not require many materials, is easy to promote, and has a wide range of applications. It can be promoted in small rivers in mountainous areas, and can also be used in large lakes and rivers. It is also suitable for large and small wooden sailboats.

    湖南木帆船革新开红花
    船旁绑扎浮水板　行船快稳运量大
    据新湖南报消息在大闹技术革新和技术革命运动中，黔阳专区洪江运输人民公社水上党支部书记滕树友同志，创造了一种“桅杆绑扎浮力装载法”，可使木帆船的载货量增加20％左右。它的操作过程很简单：当船只卸载以后，利用旧索缆（或铅丝）将两根桅杆系在船的两旁（桅尖和船头方向一致）、距离水面约2分米处，使船身受载下沉后，桅杆的绝大部分浸在水里，一部分浮在水面上。这样，很少增加水的阻力，却增加了水的浮力，因此就扩大了船只载量。后来，麻阳运输公社的职工又进一步改进两只船的桅杆只能扎一只船的办法，利用废船旧料做成浮水板（和船身一样长，一般用宽4—5寸、厚1寸左右的两块板子）绑在船只两旁，也同样可起桅杆绑扎的作用。这种先进的装载法，经过黔阳专署交通局的提倡，已在沅水流域二万九千多吨木帆船中全面推广。
    这种装载法的优点是：吃水浅、航速快、装载多。经过在大、小不同的帆船上扎绑试验，一般均提高载量20％左右。由于它吃水比一般船只浅，航速就比一般船快，在过浅滩时可不提驳，或减少提驳，加快行船速度；其次是扎绑以后的船，增加了船身和水的接触面，可使船只行驶更为平稳、安全；碰撞上岩石和障碍物时，能起保护船身的作用。这种装载法不需好多材料，很容易推广，而且适用范围广，可在山区小河中推广，也可在平湖大河中使用，还适用于大、小不同的木帆船。
