Ode to the Bumper Harvest Square

	The bumper harvest square is more beautiful than a park,
	A red flag hangs before the command post,
	The land is as smooth as a mirror,
	The canal ends and ridges are as straight as a line,
	The wide roads are flat and smooth,
	The gardens outside the square block out the sky,
	People say the scenery of West Lake is good,
	But it's not as good as the great park of the bumper harvest square.
			(Shanxi)

   丰产方赞歌
   方田美丽赛公园，
   指挥台前红旗悬，
   土地平整如镜面，
   渠端埂直如线牵，
   宽敞道路平坦坦，
   方外园林遮住天，
   人说西湖风景好，
  不如方田大公园。
              （山西）
