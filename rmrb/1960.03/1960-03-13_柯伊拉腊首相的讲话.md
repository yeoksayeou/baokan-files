Xinhua News Agency, March 12th – Premier Koirala's Speech

Respected Premier Zhou Enlai, esteemed Excellencies and friends,

I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Your Excellency for hosting this banquet tonight to welcome me. Since my arrival in China, I have felt the warm welcome and hospitality of Chinese government officials and the people, permeated with sincere friendship and goodwill. I am indeed very grateful to you all for this kind welcome and for the thoughtful arrangements made to make our stay in China pleasant and comfortable.

Please also allow me to thank Your Excellency for expressing in your speech the warm and friendly feelings towards the people of Nepal, and for mentioning the profound goodwill shown by His Majesty the King of Nepal, the government, and the people towards you during your visit to Nepal in 1957. I myself have always hoped to be able to visit your great country and meet the Chinese people; now, thanks to the kind invitation from Your Excellency and the Chinese government, my wish has been fulfilled, for which I am very pleased. For the past three days, the Chinese government and people have given me a warm welcome and cordial hospitality, which has allowed me to personally experience your friendship and goodwill towards Nepal and the Nepalese people. This is indeed very satisfying to me.

I completely agree with Your Excellency that the fundamental issue facing our two countries is the development of our nations. Although our political systems are different, Nepal and China both accept the principles of peaceful coexistence as the basic policy guiding relations between countries. We share the same goal of fully developing our own countries, and we are both making our best efforts to develop our countries as quickly as we can within our capabilities. Although Nepal has always been an independent country, our economy is backward. Therefore, in order to develop the country, it is necessary to carry out social reforms, and we are engaged in creating a new society. In this great undertaking of building a new Nepal, the assistance we receive from friendly countries is of great help to us; we are very grateful to Your Excellency's government for providing selfless and friendly economic assistance to our country's economic development plans. In view of the growing friendly relations between our two countries, I hope that the scope of this mutual assistance will continue to increase and expand.

This morning I had the opportunity to visit the agricultural exhibition held in Beijing. We were deeply impressed by the progress you have made in agriculture in recent years. We were also deeply impressed by the extensive construction work being carried out throughout Beijing. We wish you complete success in your great endeavors. I also hope that this impressive visit to China and the experiences gained during the visit will be of great use and help to us.

As everyone knows, our foreign policy is one of friendship and neutrality. We believe that not aligning with any power bloc, not participating in military alliances, and expressing our opinions based on the merits of each international issue helps to promote world peace. We also believe that world peace is a necessary condition for the economic development and prosperity of underdeveloped countries. Therefore, for the benefit of all, we advocate world peace. I believe that problems between countries can be resolved through negotiations and direct contact, because negotiations and direct contact naturally lead to a friendly atmosphere. I fully agree with Your Excellency that all differences in international issues should be resolved through peaceful negotiations. I believe that my visit to China will once again prove this point and lead to the further development of our friendship.

I hope that my visit to China will strengthen and consolidate the friendship between our two countries, which has existed for thousands of years. I am honored to convey to you all the friendship and goodwill of His Majesty the King of Nepal, the government, and the people towards the Chinese government and people.

Finally, on this happy occasion, please allow me to propose a toast:

    To the ever-growing friendship between Nepal and China,
    To the solidarity of Asian and African countries,
    To the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence,
    To world peace,
    To the prosperity of the Chinese people,
    To Your Excellency's health and happiness,
    To the health and happiness of Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Chairman Mao Zedong!
    Cheers!

    柯伊拉腊首相的讲话
    新华社12日讯　尼泊尔首相柯伊拉腊在宴会上的讲话尊敬的周恩来总理，各位阁下和朋友们，
    阁下今晚举行这个宴会来欢迎我，对此我表示衷心的感谢。从我到达中国以来，我感受到中国政府官员和人民的热烈欢迎和款待中，贯穿着热诚的友情和好意。我对各位的确十分感激，感激你们这种亲切的欢迎，以及为使我们在中国过得愉快和舒适而作的妥贴的安排。
    请允许我也感谢阁下在讲话中对尼泊尔人民表示了亲切和友好的感情，并且提到了1957年你访问尼泊尔期间，尼泊尔国王陛下、政府和人民对你所表示的深厚的善意。我自己也一直十分希望能够访问你们伟大的国家和会见中国的人民；现在由于阁下和中国政府的亲切邀请，使我的这一愿望得以实现，为此我感到非常高兴。三天来，中国政府和人民给了我热烈的欢迎和亲切的款待，这使我亲身体会到你们对尼泊尔和尼泊尔人民的友谊和善意。这的确是使我十分感到满意的。
    我完全同意阁下的意见，我们两国所面临的根本问题就是开发国家的问题。虽然我们的政治制度不同，尼泊尔和中国都接受和平共处的各项原则为指导各国间关系的基本政策。我们抱有全面发展自己国家的同样的目的，我们都在作最大的努力，以便就我们力所能及来尽快地发展我们的国家。虽然尼泊尔一直是一个独立的国家，我们的经济是落后的。因此为了开发国家，有必要进行社会改革，而我们正在从事创立一个新的社会。在这个建设新尼泊尔的伟大事业中，我们从友邦所得到的援助对我们帮助很大；我们十分感激阁下的政府对我国的经济发展计划提供了无私的、友好的经济援助。有鉴于我们两国间日益发展的友好关系，我希望这种互助的范围也会继续增加和扩大。
    今天上午我有机会参观了在北京举行的农业展览会。这几年来你们在农业方面取得的进展，使我们得到深刻的印象。在整个北京市进行着的广泛的建设工作，也使我们印象很深。我们祝你们的伟大的努力得到全面的成功。我也希望这次来中国的印象强烈的访问和访问中所获得的经验，将对我们有很大的用处和帮助。
    大家都知道，我们的外交政策是友好和中立的外交政策。我们认为，不和任何势力集团结合在一起，不参加军事同盟，根据每一个国际问题的是非来表示意见，这样做是有助于促进世界和平的。我们也认为，对于不发达国家的经济发展和繁荣，世界和平是必要的条件。因此，为了大家的好处，我们拥护世界和平。我相信，各国间的问题可以通过谈判和直接接触获得解决，因为谈判和直接接触自然会导致友好的气氛。我完全同意阁下的意见，就是国际问题上的一切分歧都应该通过和平谈判加以解决。我相信，我这次来中国访问将再次证明这一点，并且导致我们的友好关系的进一步发展。
    我希望我对中国的访问将加强和巩固我们两国间有几千年历史的友谊。我荣幸地向诸位转达尼泊尔国王陛下、政府和人民对中国政府和人民的友谊和善意。
    最后，在这个愉快的场合，请允许我提议：
    为尼泊尔和中国之间不断增长的友谊，
    为亚非各国的团结，
    为和平共处五项原则，
    为世界和平，
    为中国人民的昌盛，
    为阁下的健康和幸福，
    为刘少奇主席和毛泽东主席的健康和幸福，
    干杯！
