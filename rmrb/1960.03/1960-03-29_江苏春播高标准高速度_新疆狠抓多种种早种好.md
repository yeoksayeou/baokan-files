Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, March 28th: A spring planting production campaign characterized by high standards and high speed is unfolding enthusiastically in the rural areas of Jiangsu.

The sowing time for various spring-sown crops such as corn, early rice, and cotton in Jiangsu Province this year has been advanced by about ten days compared to previous years. Currently, sowing in some counties and communes in Nantong, Xuzhou, Huaiyin, and other regions has basically ended. Early rice has already begun to be sown in the fields. In Suzhou Prefecture, where the season is earlier, more than half of the 90,000 mu of rice paddies have been sown. The sowing of economic crops such as cotton, tobacco, flax, and sugar is also underway. Judging from the already sown areas, the quality is very good, and many regions have achieved garden-like cultivation and standardized operations.

Jiangsu Province's preparations for spring planting this year are better than in any previous year. Its characteristics are: early start, solid foundation, large area, comprehensive arrangements, many innovations, and rapid progress. As early as last winter, the province launched a "winter doing spring work" movement, and a farmland capital construction movement centered on water, fertilizer, and soil, laying a solid material foundation for spring plowing and spring planting. This year, the province's spring planting area has increased by more than 4.4 million mu compared to last year, even though the area of summer-harvested crops has increased by 10 million mu more than last year and the spring crop area has been relatively reduced. The province's multiple cropping index will increase by about 15% compared to last year. The area of economic crops such as tobacco, flax, and sugar has also greatly developed. Various regions have also implemented a series of reforms in the layout of spring-sown crops, planting systems, planting methods, and sowing techniques. The Xuhuai area has implemented large-scale planting. Nantong, Xuzhou, Huaiyin, and other regions with large areas of spring corn have made many reforms to corn planting methods, such as changing single cropping to intercropping. All of this has provided very favorable conditions for completing this year's spring planting tasks with high standards and high speed.

In order to complete the spring planting tasks with high standards and high speed, various regions have universally promoted the use of various new and improved machines while rationally arranging labor. According to incomplete statistics, the province has invested a total of more than 24 million pieces of new and improved plowing, harrowing, sowing, transportation, and drainage and irrigation machinery in this year's spring planting campaign, exceeding any previous year. Taicang, Sheyang, and other counties have reformed cotton planting tools and vigorously promoted seeders, seedling transplanters, fertilizer applicators, multi-head sprayers, nutrient pot makers, and cultivators to ensure early sowing, full emergence, and strong seedlings for cotton. Sangju Commune in Shuyang County promoted a corn row seeder in the trial sowing of corn, which can sow more than 30 mu per day, and has high work efficiency and good specifications, with the row spacing being neither too wide nor too narrow. Because of the fixed spacing and rows, a lot of manual labor can be saved in the future when keeping seedlings. Now, this type of seeder has been promoted throughout Shuyang County. In the spring planting campaign, various regions also adopted methods such as running training classes, organizing visits to advanced areas for study, and holding on-site meetings to train a large number of technical backbones and production experts.

In spring planting production, in order to implement new measures and adhere to high standards and high speed, Party committees at all levels have used high-yield demonstration plots and command fields as bases, working with technicians and experienced farmers to carry out trial sowing and set examples. In Huaiyin Prefecture, 20,000 people, from leading cadres of the Prefectural Party Committee to production team leaders, lived in the fields and worked with technicians and farmers to conduct trial sowing. Through trial sowing, they unified their thinking, established models of new technologies and new specifications, enabled the broad masses of commune members to master operating techniques, and ensured the high standards and high speed of large-scale spring planting. The spring corn that has already been sown in the entire area meets high standards, and the spring corn sowing task will be completed before the end of March, half a month earlier than in previous years.

Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, March 28th: Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is focusing on three key aspects: planting multiple crops, planting early, and planting well. The spring plowing and sowing this year has presented a new situation of being early, fast, and good from the very beginning. As of now, the region has sown more than 1.7 million mu of early spring crops such as spring wheat, barley, highland barley, rapeseed, and flax, an area that has increased by nearly doubled compared to the same period last year.

Expanding the planting area and ensuring an increase in total grain output is one of the successful experiences of the Autonomous Region's Party Committee in leading Xinjiang's farmers to achieve a sustained leap forward in agricultural production. Starting last winter, the region launched an unprecedented preparatory movement combining large-scale water conservancy construction with reclaiming wasteland and creating fields. After a winter and spring of hard work and skillful work, nearly 4 million mu of fertile wasteland with water conservancy facilities have been reclaimed, and all of these lands can be sown during the spring and summer sowing seasons. The work of reclaiming wasteland and creating fields is still continuing.

In addition to focusing on water conservancy, reclaiming wasteland, and carrying out large-scale farmland capital construction, the people's communes and military reclamation farms in northern Tianshan are also drawing on the good snow moisture from last winter and the prediction of more rain in the spring and summer this year to transfer a large number of laborers and livestock to the mountainous areas to plant dry land crops in order to increase total grain output. The people's communes in southern Tianshan are also using the open space in the Euphrates poplar forests that are flooded to plant more spring wheat, oil crops, and other crops, so as to free up more good land for planting cotton. According to statistics from relevant departments, the planting area of ​​grain, oil crops, and cotton in the region this year will be expanded by more than 10% to 20% compared to last year.

According to the characteristics of this year's earlier warming climate and the strong cold resistance of early spring crops, the spring sowing work in the region has generally been advanced by seven days to half a month compared to last year.

In order to ensure multiple planting, early planting, and good planting, various regions have transferred a large number of cadres to the forefront of production. The Autonomous Region's various systems will divide and contract the agricultural production of counties, communes, and brigades along the railway line. At the same time, the Autonomous Region has organized inspection teams to go to various places in northern and southern Xinjiang to inspect production and help with the work. Many counties and people's communes have formed spring plowing and spring sowing command departments and groups headed by the First Secretary of the Party Committee, and moved their offices to the fields. At the beginning of spring plowing, each people's commune formed various specialized teams (groups) such as fertilizer transportation, fertilizer application, plowing and land preparation, sowing and pressing, according to the production specialties and physical conditions of the commune members, and established a ring-by-ring inspection and acceptance system to make the sowing work fast and good.

    江苏春播高标准高速度  新疆狠抓多种种早种好
    据新华社南京28日电　一个以高标准高速度为特色的春播大生产运动，正在江苏农村热火朝天地开展着。
    江苏全省今年的玉米、早稻、棉花等各种春播作物的播种时间，都比往年提早十天左右。目前，南通、徐州、淮阴等地区的部分县社播种已经基本结束。各地早稻已经开始落谷。季节较早的苏州专区，九万亩秧田已有一半以上落谷。棉花、烟、麻、糖等经济作物的播种工作也正在开始。从已播种的情况来看，质量都很好，许多地区做到耕作园田化，操作规格化。
    江苏省今年春播的准备工作比以往任何一年都好。其特点是：动手早、基础好、面积大、安排全、革新多和进度快。早在去年冬天，全省就掀起了一个“春活冬干”，和以水、肥、土为中心的农田基本建设运动，为春耕春播打下了雄厚的物质基础。今年全省各地的春播面积，在夏熟作物面积比去年多出一千万亩、春茬相对减少的情况下，仍较去年增加了四百四十多万亩。全省复种指数将比去年提高15％左右。烟、麻、糖等经济作物面积也有很大发展。各地在春播作物的布局、种植制度、种植方法和播种技术上也实行了一系列的改革。徐淮地区实行了成片种植。春玉米面积较大的南通、徐州、淮阴等地区，对玉米种植方法，进行了许多改革，如改单作为间作等。这一切，都给高标准高速度地完成今年春播任务，提供了十分有利的条件。
    为了高标准高速度地完成春播任务，各地在合理安排劳力的同时，普遍推广使用各种新式的和改良的机具。据不完全统计，全省投入今年春播运动的耕耙、播种、运输和排灌的各种新式和改良机具共达二千四百多万件，超过了以往任何一年。太仓、射阳等县改革种棉工具，大力推广播种器、移苗器、施肥器、多头喷雾器、制营养钵器、中耕器，保证了棉花的早播全苗壮苗。沭阳县桑苴公社在玉米试播中，推广了玉米定行播种器，一天能种三十多亩，而且工效高，规格好，行距不宽不窄。由于定塘定行，今后留苗时可以节省很多人工。现在，这种播种器已在沭阳全县推广。各地在春播运动中，还采取办训练班、组织到先进地区参观学习、召开现场会议等办法，培养训练大批技术骨干和生产能手。
    在春播生产中，为贯彻新措施，坚持高标准高速度，各级党委都以丰产片、指挥田为基地与技术员和有经验的农民大搞试播，做出样子。淮阴专区从地委负责干部到生产队长共二万人，都住到田头与技术员、农民一道搞试播。通过试播，统一了思想认识，树立了新技术、新规格的样子，使广大社员掌握了操作技术，保证了大面积春播的高标准高速度。现在全区已播种的春玉米，亩亩合乎高标准的要求，3月底之前春玉米播种任务即将完成，比往年提早半个月。
    据新华社乌鲁木齐28日电　新疆维吾尔自治区各地狠抓多种、种早、种好三个环节，今年春耕播种一开始就呈现出了又早、又快、又好的新形势。截至目前，全区已播种春小麦、大麦、青稞、油菜、胡麻等早春作物一百七十多万亩，面积比去年同期增加了将近一倍。
    扩大播种面积，保证粮食总产量增加，是自治区党委领导新疆农民实现农业生产持续跃进的成功经验之一。从去冬开始，全区掀起了史无前例的大兴水利与开荒造田相结合的备耕运动。经过一冬一春的苦干、巧干，已开垦出有水利设施的肥沃荒地近四百万亩，这些土地在春播和夏播阶段全部都可下种。目前开荒造田工作还在继续进行。
    各地除了狠抓水利、开荒，大搞农田基本建设以外，天山北部各人民公社和军垦农场还根据去冬雪墒好和预测今年春夏雨水多的情况，抽调大批劳力畜力到山区种旱田，以增加粮食总产量。天山以南各人民公社也利用洪水漫灌的胡杨林空地，多种春麦、油料等作物，以便腾出更多好地种棉花。据有关部门统计，今年全区粮食、油料和棉花的播种面积，都将比去年扩大百分之十几到20％以上。
    根据今年气候暖得较早、早春作物耐寒能力强的特点，全区春播工作普遍比去年提早了七天到半个月。
    为了确保多种、种早、种好，各地都抽调大批干部深入生产第一线。自治区级各系统将分片包干铁路沿线的县、公社、大队的农业生产。同时，自治区组织检查组，分赴南北疆各地检查生产，帮助工作。不少县和人民公社以党委第一书记为首，组成春耕春播指挥部和小组，将办公室搬到地头。各人民公社在春耕一开始，就按照社员的生产特长和体力条件，组成运肥、施肥、犁地整地、播种镇压等各种专业队（组），建立起环环检查验收制度，使播种工作又快又好。（附图片）
