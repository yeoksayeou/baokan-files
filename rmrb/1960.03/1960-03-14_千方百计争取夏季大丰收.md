　　Henan

　　This newspaper reports that Henan Province's 83.6 million mu of wheat has basically passed the regreening stage. During the wheat regreening period, 50 million mu of wheat fields have been irrigated with regreening water, 53 million mu of wheat fields have been loosened to conserve moisture, and over 60 million mu of wheat fields have been top-dressed with regreening fertilizer, opening up another gateway for a bumper wheat harvest.
　　This year, wheat regreening began about ten days earlier than in previous years. Currently, the wheat is growing very robustly with a high tillering rate. According to statistics from five special districts and cities, first-class seedlings account for 71.6%, second-class seedlings account for 22.8%, and third-class seedlings account for 5.6%. Except for the third-class seedlings, which tiller at 400,000 to 500,000 plants per mu, the rest tiller at 600,000 to 1,000,000 plants per mu, with some reaching over 1,000,000 plants per mu.
　　During the wheat regreening period, spring drought posed a significant threat. In late February, the Henan Provincial Party Committee issued a call to "Fight the drought until the heavens bow their heads, and vow to win a bumper wheat harvest." All parts of the province responded enthusiastically, quickly launching a vigorous campaign to combat drought and irrigate the wheat. Various localities have emphatically strengthened leadership in difficult areas, allowing the irrigation campaign to develop in a balanced manner. In order to solve the irrigation problems in hilly areas, the Nanyang Special District has generally established drought resistance and irrigation headquarters in various places, dividing the hilly land into 78 drought resistance and irrigation areas, led by secretaries, with responsibility divided into sections. They have vigorously launched a concentrated effort and have now completed regreening irrigation. The Xinxiang Special District has better soil moisture conditions and has focused on wheat field management centered on base fertilizer, with 97% of wheat fields top-dressed with regreening fertilizer.
　　Strengthening scientific management is a new characteristic of this year's wheat regreening period. From the start of sowing, various localities established a file management system based on past experience. Before regreening, many measures were taken to prevent wheat lodging in high-yield areas. Based on wheat growth, fertilization and watering were taken according to the condition of the seedlings. In order to control ineffective tillering and excessive growth, various localities generally carried out suppression and harrowing of wheat fields before regreening, with a total suppression and harrowing area of 40 million mu in the province.

　　Shanxi
　　This newspaper reports that people's communes in various parts of Shanxi are concentrating water resources to give priority to irrigating winter wheat in the current drought resistance campaign, making every effort to win a bumper wheat harvest.
　　Shanxi Province has not had a thorough rain since last winter, and drought threatens the normal growth of wheat. In order to ensure a bumper wheat harvest, various localities first concentrated their efforts on wheat management activities focused on attacking water and fertilizer shortages. At present, more than 1.39 million laborers throughout the province have been invested in drought resistance and wheat irrigation, one-third of the wheat has been irrigated with regreening water, 50% of the wheat has been top-dressed with regreening fertilizer, and 64% of the wheat fields have been harrowed and suppressed. As a result, first-class wheat seedlings have increased from the original 55% to 64%, the original second-class seedlings have also caught up with the first-class, and the yellow and thin third-class wheat seedlings are only 6% or less.
　　In the wheat field management campaign centered on drought resistance, the people's communes have given full play to their superiority, and adopted a variety of measures to greatly tap water sources and expand the irrigated area of wheat fields. The Jinan Special District recently ranked the water conservancy projects under construction, and gave priority to speeding up the construction progress of projects that can be put into spring irrigation according to the principle of focusing on small-scale projects and benefiting the current situation, and completed 1,723 small-scale water conservancy projects in advance, so that 290,000 mu of wheat fields were irrigated in time. The Jinzhong Special District launched a mass campaign to urgently sink wells, taking a lot of groundwater, and more than 10,000 water wells that have been completed have been put into spring irrigation.
　　In the high tide of wheat field management, various localities paid special attention to giving the third-class wheat seedlings "preferential treatment", allowing the late-sown fields to catch up with the normally-sown fields, making mountainous areas catch up with plains, transforming dry land into paddy fields, breaking through weak links, and ensuring the normal growth of various wheat seedlings. After completing the irrigation task of 85,000 mu of irrigated wheat land in areas with water conservancy conditions, the Jishan County drought resistance army immediately turned to drought-stricken areas. Under the slogan of "If the sky does not rain, people will rain, and we will definitely turn dry land into paddy fields," workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers all went into battle, taking the method of carting and carrying, and each person is fighting day and night to ensure the irrigation of one mu of wheat land. Pingyao County built reservoirs in mountainous areas to store water, and built winding canals to divert water up the mountains, turning dry land wheat into paddy field wheat. In the plains, the method of building canals in sections and building pumping stations at high altitudes was used to raise the river water level by level, and the water was diverted to irrigate many plateau wheat fields.

　　Anhui

　　According to Xinhua News Agency, Anhui Province is taking the method of prevention as the main focus, while making medicine and preventing and controlling diseases, to carry out preparations to eliminate rust, and is determined to eliminate wheat rust in its initial stage. The province has now sprayed medicine to prevent and control rust in 1.56 million mu of wheat fields, which is five times more than the diseased area.
　　The more than 46 million mu of wheat and barley sown this year in Anhui Province are generally growing well. Members of the People's Commune have great confidence in winning a bumper summer harvest this year. The Party committees at all levels paid special attention to the preparation work for preventing and controlling wheat rust, and with the determination to "find a little, treat a lot, find a lot, treat a whole area", they did not allow rust to show its head. The Wuhu Special District mobilizes more than 110,000 people every day to specifically prevent and control rust and rapeseed toxin diseases, and 650,000 mu have now been sprayed with drugs. The Lu'an Special District has already achieved that every county has a forecast and prediction station, every commune has an information point, and every production team has an information officer. They generally adopted the method of combining aerial reconnaissance of rust spores with ground inspection, combining mass census with observation, and combining disease forecast with weather forecast, laying a dragnet for wheat rust.
　　While severely treating diseased fields and organizing disease eradication agencies, various localities also paid close attention to the production of medicines and machinery. Ningguo County has adopted the method of fixing full-time people to run factories and specialized leadership, and has now collected and produced more than 6.5 million catties of local pesticides. Guichi County has used local pyrite ore to refine more than 100,000 catties of sulfur, and Fengyang County has burned 744 dan of barium polysulfide.

　　Jiangsu

　　This newspaper, Nanjing, 12th of this month, reports that the rapeseed planting situation in Jiangsu Province's more than three million mu this year is very good. At present, various localities are carrying out a spring field management campaign to "ensure the area and strive for high yields."
　　The rapeseed sowing and transplanting season in Jiangsu Province was advanced by 10 to 15 days compared to the past, the base fertilizer was sufficient, and the area of improved varieties was expanded by more than 30% compared to last year. The whole province also cultivated more than 150 million "rapeseed kings". At present, about 90% of the rapeseed seedlings in the province are first and second class.
　　This year, Jiangsu Province regards ensuring that the rapeseed area is not reduced by one mu and striving for full and strong seedlings in every mu as the primary measures in rapeseed production. In order to completely change the old pattern of "large sowing area and small harvesting area" in the past, various localities, while sowing, cultivated a certain area of "peace seedlings" according to the size of the rapeseed area, and tried every means to use dike banks, ditch sides, roadsides, and cemeteries to widely cultivate rapeseed reserve seedlings, preparing to transplant seedlings for replanting and appropriately expand the rapeseed area.
　　The county, city, and commune Party committees in the rapeseed producing areas, in order to ensure that one mu is sown and one mu is harvested, all strictly separated the rapeseed fields from the canteen vegetable fields, and paid close attention to the arrangement of non-staple foods, planting more spring vegetables early to meet the needs of the broad masses of commune members to improve their lives. Some areas have also mobilized the masses to plant more vegetables and not eat rapeseed.
　　In this year's work of ensuring the rapeseed area, various localities have implemented the quota contract system. Leaders at all levels have gone deep into the grassroots, grasped the situation in sections, contracted the rapeseed area down layer by layer, established professional teams, and clarified the responsibility system. Many areas have also implemented fixed-field insertion cards, fixing the labor force for managing rapeseed fields. On the Xuhuai Plain, the counties widely use spring idle fields to transplant rapeseed, moving the over-dense seedlings in the direct-sown fields and the rapeseed seedlings intercropped in the wheat fields to the winter idle fields (after the rapeseed is harvested, a season of sweet potatoes and soybeans can be planted). The counties in the Zhenjiang mountainous area have opened up mountainous areas and the "ten edges" to expand the rapeseed area.
　　While ensuring the area, various localities have also strengthened field management during the rapeseed bolting period, promoting early bolting and early branching of rapeseed to achieve more flowering and more pod formation. With water and fertilizer as the main focus, they fully meet the needs of rapeseed growth and development, and also do a series of work such as opening drainage ditches, cultivating and banking up soil, preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, and preventing frost, managing rapeseed as well as cultivating the three wheats. The Suzhou Special District has universally applied a bolting fertilizer to 900,000 mu of rapeseed once.

    千方百计争取夏季大丰收
    河南：八千万亩小麦渡过返青关　山西：给三类麦苗“吃偏饭”
    安徽：开展防治小麦锈病活动　江苏：确保油菜种一亩收一亩
    河南
    本报讯　河南全省八千三百六十万亩小麦已基本上渡过了返青关。在小麦返青期间，已给五千万亩麦田浇了返青水，对五千三百万亩麦田进行了松土保墒，还给六千多万亩麦田追施了返青肥，为小麦大丰收闯开了又一道关口。
    今年小麦返青比往年要早十天左右。目前小麦长得十分茁壮，分蘖率很高。据五个专、市统计，一类苗占71．6％，二类苗占22．8％，三类苗占5．6％；除三类苗每亩分蘖在四十万至五十万株以外，其余均达六十万至一百万株，有的高达一百万株以上。
    在小麦返青期间，春旱带来很大威胁。中共河南省委于2月下旬发出了“抗旱抗到天低头，誓夺小麦大丰收”的号召，全省各地热烈响应，迅速掀起了气势磅礴的抗旱浇麦运动。各地突出地加强了对困难地区的领导，使浇麦运动得以平衡发展。南阳专区为解决岗坡丘陵地的浇水问题，各地普遍建立了岗坡丘陵抗旱浇麦指挥部，把岗坡地划为七十八个抗旱浇麦方，由书记挂帅，分片包干，大力突击，现已浇完返青水。信阳专区墒情较好，突出的抓了以底肥为中心的麦田管理，有97％的麦田追施了返青肥。
    加强科学管理是今年小麦返青期间的一个新特点。从播种开始，各地就根据以往经验，建立了档案管理制度；返青之前，对丰产方就进行了许多预防小麦倒伏的工作；根据小麦生长情况，施肥和浇水都采取了按苗定措施。为控制无效分蘖和陡长，返青前各地普遍对麦田进行了镇压和耙耱，全省镇压和耙耱面积达四千万亩。
    山西
    本报讯　山西各地人民公社在当前防旱抗旱运动中，集中用水优先灌溉冬小麦，千方百计争取小麦大丰收。
    山西省从去冬以来没有落过透雨，干旱威胁着小麦正常生长。为了确保小麦大丰收，各地首先集中力量展开了以攻水、攻肥为主的小麦管理活动。目前全省投入抗旱浇麦的劳力达一百三十九万多个，已给三分之一的小麦浇了返青水，给50％的小麦追了返青肥，64％的麦田经过耙耱和镇压。因此，一类麦苗已由原来的55％，增加到64％，原来的二类苗也赶上了一类，黄瘦的三类麦苗，只有6％以下。
    在以抗旱为中心的麦田管理运动中，人民公社都充分发挥了优越性，采取多种多样的措施大挖水源，扩大麦田灌溉面积。晋南专区最近对正在施工的水利工程进行了排队，根据以小型为主当前受益为主的原则，优先加快了能够投入春浇工程的施工进度，并提前完成了一千七百二十三件小型水利工程，使二十九万亩麦田及时得到了灌溉。晋中专区开展了群众性的打井突击运动，大取地下水，现在已打成的一万余眼水井已投入了春浇。
    各地在麦田管理高潮中，特别注意给三类麦苗“吃偏饭”，让回茬赶上正茬，使山地赶上平川，旱地变水田，突破了薄弱环节，保证各类麦苗正常生长。稷山县在有水利条件的地区完成了八万五千亩水地小麦灌溉任务后，抗旱大军立即转向干旱地区，他们在“天不下雨人下雨，定叫旱地变水田”的口号下，工农商学兵一齐上阵，采取车拉人担的办法，每人正为保浇一亩麦田日夜地战斗着。平遥县在山区建库蓄水，修盘山渠引水上山，把旱地小麦变成了水地小麦。在平川区用分段筑渠、台高处建抽水工程的方法，让河水级级抬高，引水浇了许多高原麦地。
    安徽
    据新华社讯　安徽省正在采取以防为主，边制药、边防治的办法，开展消灭锈病的准备活动，决心把麦锈病消灭在初生阶段。全省现已喷药防治的麦田有一百五十六万亩，比发病面积多五倍。
    今年安徽省播种的四千六百多万亩大小麦，普遍生长良好。人民公社社员对夺取今年夏季丰收的信心很大。各级党委特别注意了防治麦锈病的准备工作，并以“发现一点、狠治一片，发现一片，狠治一方”的决心，不让锈病露头。芜湖专区每天出动十一万多人，专门防治锈病和油菜的毒素病，现已有六十五万亩喷洒过药物。六安专区已经做到县县有预测预报站，公社有情报点，生产队有情报员，他们普遍采取空中侦察锈病孢子与地面检查相结合、群众性普查与观察相结合、病情测报与气象预报相结合的办法，给麦锈病布下天罗地网。
    各地在狠治病田和组织灭病机构的同时，还大抓药械生产。宁国县采取固定专人办厂、专职领导的办法，现已采制土农药六百五十多万斤。贵池县已利用当地硫铁矿石炼出硫磺十多万斤，凤阳县已烧制多硫化钡七百四十四担。
    江苏
    本报南京12日电　江苏省今年三百多万亩油菜生长情况十分良好，目前各地正在开展一个“保面积、争高产”的春季田间管理运动。
    江苏省油菜播种移栽季节，比以往提早十到十五天，基肥充足，良种面积比去年扩大30％以上。全省各地还培育油菜王一亿五千多万株。目前全省油菜一、二类苗达到90％左右。
    今年江苏省把确保油菜面积一亩不少和争取亩亩全苗苗壮作为油菜生产上首要的措施。为了彻底改变过去“播种面积大，收获面积小”这一老规律，各地在播种的同时，根据油菜面积的大小，培育一定面积的太平苗，并千方百计的利用圩岸、沟边、路旁、坟场广育油菜预备秧苗，准备移苗补种，适当扩大油菜面积。
    油菜产区的县、市和公社党委，为了确保种一亩收一亩，各地都把油菜田和食堂蔬菜田严格分开，狠抓当前副食品的安排，早种多种春菜，以适应广大社员改善生活的需要。有些地区还动员群众多种蔬菜不吃油菜。
    今年油菜保面积工作中，各地都贯彻了定额包干制度，各级领导深入基层，分片掌握，层层把油菜面积包下去，建立专业队伍，明确责任制度。许多地区还实行定田插牌，把管理油菜田的劳力固定下来。徐淮平原上，各县广泛利用春闲田，移栽油菜，把直播田里过密的苗和麦田夹种的油菜苗移到冬闲田里（油菜收获后又可以种一季山芋、大豆）。镇江山区各县开辟山地和十边，扩大油菜面积。
    在确保面积的同时，各地又加强油菜抽苔期的田间管理，促使油菜早抽苔、早发杈，达到多开花多结荚。以水肥为主，充分满足油菜生长发育需要，同时还做好开排水沟、中耕培土、防治病虫害、预防霜冻等一系列工作，像培植三麦一样管好油菜。苏州专区九十万亩油菜已普遍追了一次抽苔肥。
