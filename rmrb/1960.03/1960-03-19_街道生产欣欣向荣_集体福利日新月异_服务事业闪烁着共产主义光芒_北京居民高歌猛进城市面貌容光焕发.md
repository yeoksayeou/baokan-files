Street Production Thrives, Collective Welfare is Constantly Renewed, Service Undertakings Shine with Communist Radiance
Beijing Residents Advance with High Spirits and the City's Appearance Radiates
200,000 street residents participate in production and service organizations; the total output value of street industries in February will be nearly twelve times that of the same period last year.
Street canteens and childcare organizations have increased substantially and are getting better and better; various service organizations are scattered throughout the streets and alleys, enthusiastically serving the residents.

(Reported by our newspaper) Beijing's street residents, while vigorously developing production, have launched a mass movement centered on production, starting with production, and vigorously developing collective living welfare undertakings and social service undertakings, playing an important role in comprehensively organizing the economic life of urban people. Now, many large and small enterprises and mass self-service street canteens, childcare organizations, and service organizations have been established in the city's streets and alleys. These new things with vigorous vitality and broad prospects are leading decentralized housework towards collectivization and liberating the vast number of housewives to participate in various production and collective living welfare undertakings. Many street residents who used to be accustomed to "sweeping the snow in front of their own doors" have developed a new style of self-service and mutual assistance, where "everyone takes care of public affairs, the masses manage their own lives, everything is taken care of, and everyone has something to do."

The mass movement of "everyone takes care of public affairs, the masses manage their own lives" that has emerged in Beijing's streets is based on the continuous leap forward in production. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, 200,000 working residents (mainly housewives) have, under the encouragement of the Party's general line for socialist construction, vigorously developed street industries and have become a new social production force. Under the leadership of the street Party committees, the vast number of working residents have worked hard, relied on their own efforts, and established a large number of street factories and production teams. More street residents participate in industries such as shoes and hats, metal, special handicrafts, stationery, printing and binding, and paper products. As of January of this year, street production in the city involved more than twenty industries, producing four to five hundred kinds of products. There is both mass production and scattered processing, actively serving state-owned industries and serving the lives of urban residents. Many street production organizations undertake the production of relatively simple products handed down by large factories, enabling some state-owned factories to free up their hands to produce more advanced products. After the state-owned Xinghua Dye Factory handed over all the auramine dyeing to the Chunshu Street Chemical Factory, it specialized in the production of high-grade dyes. Many street factories in Xicheng District produce a large number of products that serve state-owned industries. The Yuetan Street Stone Powder Factory supplies more than 50 tons of quartz sand and quartz powder to large factories such as Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company and Beijing Steel Plant every month. The Erlong Road Street Paint Factory produces more than ten tons of paint thinner every month, supporting the production of more than sixty factories. The products of these street industries play a role of "picking up the slack and making up for deficiencies" in the field of production, helping the overall leap forward of the city's industry. They have also supplemented the shortcomings of large industries in the production of daily necessities. Especially after the implementation of the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, street industries have seen an even greater leap forward. The total output value and processing fees created in the past year reached more than 110 million yuan, close to the total industrial output value of Beijing in 1949 at the time of liberation. Entering 1960, Beijing's street industries have seen great development. In the single month of February, the total output value and processing fees of street industries in the city have risen to more than 52 million yuan, nearly twelve times that of the same period last year. The street factories under the jurisdiction of the Fusui Jing Street Office in Xicheng District had only eight factories when they started, but now they have increased to twenty-three. Now, more than 9,100 people in this area participate in production and collective living service undertakings, accounting for more than 90% of the total labor force, turning this originally consumer-oriented residential area into a working residents' area, and a new atmosphere of "everyone engaging in production, every household having no idle people" has emerged on the streets.

With the development of street production, more and more housewives are actively participating in social production labor. People's collective labor urgently requires the socialization of housework, especially those housewives who have already participated in production or want to participate in production but are burdened by housework, urgently need to get rid of tedious housework and arrange their lives in order to concentrate on production or work. To meet this need, the residents of each district and street, under the leadership of the street Party committees, based on the principles of "making the most of what is available and adapting to local conditions," and adopting the method of combining "large, medium, and small," pooled their efforts and relied on their own efforts to vigorously develop collective living welfare undertakings and social service undertakings. While the masses vigorously develop street canteens and childcare organizations, small canteens and simple childcare classes have also developed. Many streets have street canteens where hundreds or even thousands of people eat, as well as small canteens where only a dozen households participate; there are street nurseries with a preliminary scale, as well as simple childcare classes that take in dozens of children.

The masses' enthusiasm for self-run collective living welfare undertakings is very high, and an inspiring atmosphere has emerged everywhere. When more than 250 residents of Xinjiekou Street vigorously developed canteens, a large number of employees, students, and personnel from financial and trade departments rushed to support them. In a very short period of time, they built five kitchens, built eleven stoves, and painted ten houses. Eleven street canteens quickly opened, and more than 800 people ate there. More than 100 residents in the front garden of Hepingli worked hard for six days and nights to build a canteen with eleven rooms and five nurseries, allowing more than 80 housewives to get rid of housework and participate in social production. An old lady wrote a poem praising collective life, saying: "People are refreshed by happy events, starting from scratch to run canteens, a happy life lasts day and night, do not forget the benefactor, the Communist Party."

Neighborhood service centers and resident service stations, known as "street general affairs sections," have been widely established throughout the city. At the end of 1959, there were more than 1,200 various service organizations run by the masses throughout the city; however, now more than 3,700 various service stations (centers) have been established throughout the city, scattered in various streets, including comprehensive street service centers and single-service points; there are neighborhood service teams, as well as various repair points. Many streets in Xuanwu District and Xicheng District have already achieved that every resident committee has a service station (center). Their service methods are diverse and flexible, and roughly include the following forms: 1. Accepting work at the store; residents are received whenever they come; 2. Going door-to-door along the streets and alleys to provide services; 3. Contracting work to households, undertaking the living affairs of street working residents and nearby factories and enterprises. Service personnel all adhere to the spirit of "serving production and facilitating the masses," and do everything possible to serve those who participate in production. For example, the Baojia Street Neighborhood Service Center undertakes the living affairs of more than 1,300 working residents in seven nearby hutongs. Because this service center has organized a part of the scattered labor force and semi-labor force to participate in service work, it has now formed a life service network that includes carpenters, masons, electricians, paperhangers, dismantling, washing, sewing, and other types of work. The service items of the Qiujia Street Service Station have gradually expanded from the initial few to the current more than 120. In addition to handling some housework that the masses request, service personnel are also divided into groups to go to the streets and alleys to find work. Some residents want to dismantle and wash quilts, which is inconvenient to carry, so the service personnel go to the street to pick them up and deliver them; if someone's family has a patient and no one to take care of them, the service personnel also take the initiative to come to the door to take care of them. This greatly facilitates the lives of the residents and has won the praise of the masses. Residents enthusiastically call the service personnel "good housekeepers of the people."

The communist style of helping others is greatly promoted among Beijing street residents. Many housewives and retired employees are competing to be "anonymous heroes" in the vigorous development of collective living welfare and social service undertakings. Their slogan is "three not afraid," one is not afraid of being dirty and tired, the second is not afraid of being broken and old, and the third is not afraid of trouble. Many cooks, childcare workers, and service personnel are thinking of the masses and thinking of socialism in everything they do, regardless of remuneration, diligently and conscientiously, doing everything possible to serve the residents. There is a staff member's family member in Donglangxia named Zhu Shuyun, who saw that many women were burdened by their children and could not participate in production, so she took the initiative to request to do childcare work. She said: "One person's participation in production is small, but running a nursery can liberate more labor." Now, the nursery where she works has taken in 37 children, helping more than 30 women participate in production. Cheng Huilan, who lives in Dacheng Lane in Xicheng District, is a female worker at the Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory. After she gave birth, she could not find a nanny. At that time, the Beizhao Dengyu Road Service Station learned of this news and immediately sent a service worker, Sun Xiuling, to her home to be a temporary nanny, taking care of the mother and infant, until the service station found a nanny for Cheng Huilan, Sun Xiuling went back to do other work. The spirit of serving the masses of the service staff deeply moved the people being served. In many families, the husband and wife go to work, and the children go to the nursery. They simply hand over the keys to their house to the service station, and all the housework is entrusted to the service personnel to handle. Many women in the Baojia Street area who participate in street production send the keys to their homes to the neighborhood service center when they go to work. The service center sends people to fetch water and start the stove in their homes, and also washes clothes and handles various living affairs on their behalf, so that the production personnel are completely free from the shackles of housework and can devote themselves to the production upsurge without any worries.

Under the leadership of the street Party committees and with the strong support of relevant departments, the growth and prosperity of this new thing of mass self-run social service undertakings and collective living welfare undertakings have been promoted. Many financial and trade departments in various districts of Beijing actively assist street service personnel in learning and improving their operational skills, supply the raw materials and materials needed for repairing items, and help establish and improve various procedural systems. The West Street Savings Office appropriately merged the original agency offices that only handled savings business for the bank, assisted residents in establishing seven neighborhood service centers, and also guided these service centers in establishing accounting systems and training accounting personnel, and the work of the service centers has been continuously consolidated and improved. Tongchun Garden Restaurant transferred experienced chefs to give lectures and practical demonstrations to the cooks of street canteens, imparting operational skills such as frying, stir-frying, cooking, and deep-frying, as well as cost accounting knowledge, so that more than 120 street canteen cooks quickly learned the techniques of making more than 20 kinds of staple and non-staple foods, improved the quality of meals, and improved business management, which was deeply welcomed by the residents.

The mass self-run collective living welfare undertakings and social service undertakings have a clear characteristic: "serving production personnel, serving socialist construction," and have formed such a situation: the continued leap forward of production undertakings has driven the great development of collective living welfare and social service undertakings; and the great development of collective living welfare and social service undertakings has greatly promoted the great leap forward of production undertakings. The masses have praised the collective living welfare and service undertakings as "thinking comprehensively, arriving in a timely manner, guaranteeing a good life for production leap forward."

    街道生产欣欣向荣  集体福利日新月异  服务事业闪烁着共产主义光芒
    北京居民高歌猛进城市面貌容光焕发
    二十万街道居民参加生产和服务组织，全市街道工业二月份产值将近去年同期十二倍
    街道食堂、托儿组织大量增加越办越好，各种服务组织分散在大街小巷热情地为居民服务
    本报讯　北京市街道居民在大规模发展生产的同时，兴起以生产为中心，从生产入手，大办集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业的群众运动，对全面组织城市人民经济生活发挥了重要的作用。现在，全市大街小巷已经兴办起许许多多大小企业和群众自我服务的街道食堂、托儿组织、服务组织。这些具有旺盛生命力和广阔前途的新生事物，把分散的家务劳动引向集体化，把广大的家庭妇女解放出来参加各项生产和集体生活福利事业。许多一向习惯于“各扫门前雪”的街道居民，兴起了“大家的事情大家办，群众的生活群众管，事事有人管，人人有事做”的自我服务、互助协作的新风尚。
    北京市街道出现的“大家的事情大家办，群众的生活群众管”的群众性运动，是在生产不断跃进的基础上产生的。从1958年大跃进以来，全市有二十万劳动居民（主要是家庭妇女）在党的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，大办街道工业，已成为一支新兴的社会生产力量。广大劳动居民在街道党委领导下，穷干苦干，自力更生，办起大批街道工厂和生产组。街道居民参加生产人数较多的有鞋帽业、金属业、特种手工艺和文具、印刷装订、纸制品等。截至今年1月，全市街道生产共有二十多种行业，生产四、五百种产品。既有成批生产，也有零星加工，积极为国营工业服务，为城市居民生活服务。许多街道生产组织担任大工厂交下来的比较简单的产品的生产，使一些国营工厂能够腾出手来生产较高级的产品。国营兴华染料厂把爱耳染色全部交给椿树街道化工厂生产后，就专门生产高级染料。西城区许多街道工厂生产的大批产品都是为国营工业服务的。月坛街道石粉厂每月供应石景山钢铁公司和北京钢厂等大工厂五十多吨石英砂和石英粉。二龙路街道喷漆厂每月自制十多吨喷漆稀料，先后支援了六十多个工厂的生产。这些街道工业的产品在生产领域中起了“拾遗补缺”的作用，帮助了全市工业的大跃进。在日用小商品生产方面也补充了大工业的不足。特别是在贯彻执行党的八届八中全会决议以后，街道工业出现了更大的跃进局面。去年一年来创造的总产值和加工费达一亿一千多万元，接近解放时1949年北京全市的工业总产值。跨进1960年，北京街道工业又有大发展。仅2月份的一个月中，全市街道工业的产值和加工费已上升到五千二百多万元，接近去年同期的十二倍。西城区福绥境街道办事处管辖地区的街道工厂开办时只有八个，到现在已增加到二十三个，现在这个地区有九千一百多人参加了生产和集体生活服务事业，占劳动力总人数的90％以上，使这个原来消费性的居民区变成了劳动居民区，街道上出现了“人人闹生产，户户无闲人”的新气象。
    随着街道生产的发展，愈来愈多的家庭妇女积极地参加社会生产劳动。人们的集体劳动，迫切需要家务劳动社会化，特别是已经参加生产或者要求参加生产而有家务拖累的家庭妇女，迫切地要求摆脱繁琐的家务，安排好生活，以便集中精力从事生产或工作。适应这种需要，各区街道居民就在街道党委领导下，本着“因陋就简、因地制宜”的方针，采取“大中小”并举的办法，群策群力、自力更生地大办集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业。在群众大办街道食堂和托儿组织的同时，小型食堂和简易托儿班等也发展起来了。许多街道出现了几百人乃至上千人用饭的街道食堂，也有十几户人家入伙的小型食堂；有初具规模的街道托儿所，也有收托几十个儿童的简易托儿班。
    群众自办集体生活福利事业的热情十分高涨，到处出现令人振奋的气象。新街口街道二百五十多名居民大办食堂时，有大批职工、学生和财贸部门工作人员赶来支援，在很短的时间内就盖好五间厨房，砌起十一个炉灶，粉刷了十间房子，十一个街道食堂很快就全部开了伙，有八百多人用饭。和平里前花园一百多个居民苦战六昼夜，兴建了拥有十一间房的一座食堂和五个托儿所，使八十多名家庭妇女摆脱了家务劳动，参加了社会生产。有位老太太写诗歌颂集体生活说：“人得喜事精神爽，白手起家办食堂，幸福生活日夜长，勿忘恩人共产党。”
    被称为“街道总务科”的邻里服务所和居民服务站，已在全市普遍兴办起来。1959年底全市群众自办的各种服务组织，有一千二百多处；可是，现在全市已建立了三千七百多个各种服务站（所），分散在各个街道，有综合性的街道服务所，也有单项服务点；有邻里服务小组，也有各种修理点。宣武区和西城区许多街道已经做到每个居民委员会都有服务站（所）。他们服务的方式多样灵活，大体有下列的形式：一、在门市收活，居民什么时候来，就什么时候接待；二、沿街串巷，服务上门；三、包活到户，承揽街道劳动居民和附近工厂、企业的生活事务。服务人员都本着“服务生产、便利群众”的精神，千方百计地为参加生产的人员服务。如鲍家街邻里服务所，承担起附近七条胡同的一千三百多户劳动居民的生活事务。这个服务所由于组织了一部分散居的劳动力和半劳动力参加服务工作，现在已经形成了一个包括木工、瓦工、电工、裱糊工、拆洗缝补等工种的生活服务网。裘家街服务站的服务项目，由最初几种逐渐扩大到现在的一百二十多种。除了代办群众要求做的一些家务事以外，服务人员还分成小组，包街包巷，深入到户去找活干。有些居民要拆洗棉被，不便携带，服务员就下街取送；谁家有病人没人照顾，服务员也主动上门来照顾。这样就大大便利了居民的生活，博得了群众的好评。居民们热情地称呼服务人员是“人民的好管家”。
    助人为乐的共产主义风格在北京街道居民中大大发扬起来。许多家庭劳动妇女和退休职工在大办集体生活福利和社会服务事业中，都争做“无名英雄”。他们的口号是“三不怕”，一不怕脏累，二不怕破旧，三不怕麻烦。许多炊事员、保育员和服务员都处处为群众着想，为社会主义着想，不计报酬，勤勤恳恳，千方百计地为居民服务。东廊下有个职工家属叫朱淑云，看到许多妇女被孩子拖累不能参加生产，就主动要求做保育工作。她说：“一个人参加生产力量小，办起托儿所可以解放更多的劳动力。”现在她参加工作的托儿所已收托儿童三十七名，帮助三十多名妇女参加了生产。住在西城区大乘巷的程惠兰，是北京第二棉纺织厂的女工。她生孩子以后，没有找到保姆，当时北赵登禹路服务所知道了这个消息，马上派了服务人员孙秀玲到她家去做临时保姆，照料产妇和婴儿，一直到服务所替程惠兰找到保姆，孙秀玲才回去做其他工作。服务工作人员的这种为群众服务的精神，深深感动了被服务的人。许多人家夫妻上班，孩子入托儿所，索性就把自己家门的钥匙交给服务所，有什么家务事全托服务人员代办了。鲍家街一带许多参加街道生产的妇女，上班时把家门的钥匙送到邻里服务所，服务所派人给她们家中挑水、生炉子，同时又包洗衣服和代办各种生活事务，使生产人员完全摆开家务的束缚，无牵挂地投入生产热潮中。
    在街道党委领导和有关部门的大力支持下，促进了群众自办社会服务事业和集体生活福利事业这一新生事物成长、茁壮。北京各区许多财贸部门积极协助街道服务人员学习和提高操作技术，供应修理物品所需要的原料、材料，帮助建立和健全各种手续制度。西大街储蓄所把原来专为银行办理储蓄业务的代办所适当合并，协助居民建立了七个邻里服务所，并且辅导这些服务所建立账目制度，训练会计人员，服务所的工作也不断得到巩固和提高。同春园饭庄抽调有经验的厨师给街道食堂炊事人员讲课和实际表演，传授煎、炒、烹、炸等操作技术和成本核算知识，使一百二十多名街道食堂炊事员，很快学会了制作二十多种主副食的技术，提高了饭菜质量，改善经营管理，深受居民欢迎。
    群众自办这些集体生活福利事业和社会服务事业都有一个鲜明的特点：“为生产人员服务，为社会主义建设服务”，并且已形成了这样的局面：生产事业的继续跃进，带动了集体生活福利和社会服务事业的大发展；而集体生活福利和社会服务事业的大发展，又大大地促进了生产事业的大跃进。群众纷纷赞扬集体生活福利和服务事业“想的周到，来的及时，保证生产跃进生活好。”（附图片）
