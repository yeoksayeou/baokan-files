    The glorious "Women's" fishing boat of the Haeju Fisheries Enterprise in Korea, led by female captain Jin Shunfu, has become a banner at sea. Now, the fishing boats operated by male workers in this fisheries enterprise are launching a labor competition to catch up with the "Women's" boat.
    In fact, the "Women's" fishing boat has been at sea for less than a year. Female captain Jin Shunfu was originally the leader of the clam harvesting team of this fisheries enterprise. After participating in the Women's Socialist Construction Workers Congress last March, she thought: The Party calls for catching more fresh fish to supply the people. Can't we women go to sea? She resolutely attacked the conservative view that women could not go to sea to fish. With the support of the leadership, she formed the "Women's" fishing boat with some other female workers last April.
    However, things didn't go smoothly. When they started fishing, they only caught more than 100 kilograms of fish in one net. But they were not discouraged. All the female workers on the boat worked hard and practiced diligently under the leadership of Jin Shunfu. When the yellow croaker fishing season arrived last year, they created a record of catching 24 tons of yellow croaker at one time, greatly exceeding the amount caught by male workers.
    The female workers of the "Women's" boat not only catch fish, but also use their spare time to catch clams and other aquatic products by various methods. As a result, they have become a banner in the socialist competition of this fisheries enterprise.

### 光荣的“妇女号”渔轮

    光荣的“妇女号”渔轮
    由女船长金顺福领导的朝鲜海州水产事业所“妇女号”渔轮，已成为海上的一面旗帜。现在这个水产事业所里由男工们掌握的渔轮正在展开追赶“妇女号”的劳动竞赛。
    其实，“妇女号”渔轮出海还不到一年，女船长金顺福原来是这个水产事业所的捕捞海蚌的作业班长。她在去年3月参加了妇女社会主义建设者大会以后就想：党号召多捕一些鲜鱼供应人民，难道我们妇女就不能出海吗？她坚决地向那种认为妇女不能出海捕鱼的保守观点进攻。在领导上的支持下，去年4月，她同另外一些女工组成了“妇女号”渔轮。
    但是，事情并不是一帆风顺的，她们开始捕鱼，下一次网只捕到一百多公斤鱼。但她们并不灰心，全船的女工们都在金顺福的领导下苦学苦练。到了去年黄花鱼鱼汛的时候，她们就创造了一次捕黄花鱼二十四吨的纪录，大大超过了男工们。
    “妇女号”的女工们不仅捕鱼，她们还利用空隙用各种方法捕捞海蚌和其他各种水产品，结果她们成为这个水产事业所的社会主义竞赛中的一面旗帜。
