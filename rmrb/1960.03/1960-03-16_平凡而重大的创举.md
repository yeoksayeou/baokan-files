    A Commonplace but Significant Creation

    The workers of the Hongjiang and Mayang Transportation People's Communes in Qianyang Special District, Hunan, created a method of increasing buoyancy by tying masts or pontoons to both sides of wooden sailboats. This method is very simple, but it can increase the carrying capacity of wooden sailboats by about 20%, and the boats travel faster and more stably. This is a commonplace but significant creation! It is commonplace because it is only a relatively small reform, not a fundamental reform like mechanization or automation. However, if we calculate a large account based on widespread promotion, we can see its greatness. Only the 400,000 tons of professional wooden sailboats in Hunan Province can increase the carrying capacity by nearly 80,000 tons annually after this experience is promoted, which is equivalent to 80% of Hunan Province's shipbuilding task this year; if this method is promoted on wooden sailboats sailing in rivers large and small across the country, how much will the carrying capacity increase! More importantly, this creation can give people many useful inspirations. We can imagine, if the pontoons are made of lightweight wood or plastic, can't they further increase buoyancy and increase the carrying capacity of the ship? We can also imagine, if barges and large ships also study and adopt similar methods, wouldn't it be possible to increase even greater transportation power?

    In the tide of national technological innovation and technological revolution, there are both great creations and small innovations. We must not ignore "small reforms." Many "small reforms" often go unnoticed, but they may open up a new path for the development of production in a certain industry, and may have significant and far-reaching impacts. The task of leaders is to be good at discovering those promising new things, cherishing them, cultivating them, and allowing them to develop and grow rapidly.

### 平凡而重大的创举

    平凡而重大的创举
    湖南黔阳专区洪江、麻阳两个运输人民公社的职工，创造了在木帆船两旁绑扎桅杆或浮水板来增加浮力的办法。这个办法很简单，但是能使木帆船载运量提高20％左右，而且船走起来更快更稳。这是一个平凡而重大的创举！说它平凡，是因为它只是一个比较小的改革，还不是像机械化、自动化那样根本的改革。但是，如果算一笔普遍推广起来的大账，那就可以看出它的伟大之处了。仅是湖南省的四十万吨专业木帆船推广这一经验以后，每年就可以增加将近八万吨的运量，相当于湖南全省今年造船任务的80％；如果在全国大大小小的河流中行驶的木帆船都推广了这个办法，那将会增加多大的运量！更重要的是，这一创造可以给人们许多有益的启发。我们可以设想，如果浮水板改用轻质木料或塑料做成，不是可以进一步增加浮力，增大船的载运量吗？我们还可以设想，如果驳轮、大船也研究采用类似作法，岂不可以增加更大的运输力量吗？
    在全国技术革新和技术革命的浪潮里，既有大创造，又有小革新。我们绝不能忽视“小改革”。许多
  “小改革”往往引不起人的注意，但是它可能开辟出某个行业发展生产的一条新途径，可能产生重大的、深远的影响。领导者的任务，就是要善于发现那些有远大前途的新生事物，爱护它，培育它，让它迅速发展壮大。
