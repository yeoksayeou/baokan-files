Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 2nd: News from Tokyo: Former Japanese Prime Minister Tanzan Ishibashi met with Liberal Democratic Party advisor Kenzo Matsumura on March 1st. According to reports, Ishibashi told Matsumura that the domestic and international situation surrounding the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" is worrying, and the time has come to reconsider the new "Security Treaty." Matsumura expressed his understanding of the spirit of Ishibashi's remarks. However, he said that the issue of the new "Security Treaty" should be handled "cautiously" in consideration of the situation within the party.

Tokyo Radio said that Ishibashi advocated re-examining the new "Security Treaty" issue, and Matsumura's and Ishibashi's ideas are basically the same. Matsumura believes that Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's foreign policy will deteriorate Japan's relations with China and the Soviet Union, making Japan an orphan in the Far East. He believes that the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" should not be forcibly signed.

Matsumura also criticized the inclusion of Jinmen (Quemoy) and Mazu Islands within the scope of the "Far East" as stipulated in the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," saying that this is "not good for future Sino-Japanese relations." According to reports, Kisami Furui, an activist believed to be from the Matsumura-Miki faction, visited the chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's Policy Research Council, Tanaka Funada, today, pointing out that including Jinmen and Mazu Islands in the scope of the new "Security Treaty" will further worsen Sino-Japanese relations and should be reconsidered.

Under the impact of the rising tide of the Japanese people's movement against the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the louder calls for improving Japan-China and Japan-Soviet relations, the dynamics of the non-mainstream faction within the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party opposing the Kishi Nobusuke group have attracted attention from all sides in Japan.

Kyodo News Agency commented on March 2nd that the dynamics within the Liberal Democratic Party to prevent Nobusuke Kishi from being elected president for a third time and the dynamics to demand the improvement of Japan-China and Japan-Soviet relations are combined, and will gradually become active with the formal deliberation of the new "Security Treaty." Middle-ranking lawmakers of the Ishibashi, Matsumura-Miki and other non-mainstream factions are already preparing to establish a "Defeat Nobusuke Kishi" parliamentary alliance, which shows that the opposition within the Liberal Democratic Party is gradually becoming more acute.

    日本执政党内矛盾加剧
    石桥说应该对日美军事条约重新进行考虑
    松村说岸信介的政策将使日本成远东孤儿
    新华社2日讯　东京消息：日本前首相石桥湛山1日会见了自由民主党顾问松村谦三。据报道，石桥对松村说，围绕着新日美“安全条约”的日本国内外形势有令人担忧之处，现在已经到了重新考虑新“安全条约”的阶段。松村表示理解石桥谈话的精神。不过他说，对于新“安全条约”问题，应该结合考虑党内情况“慎重处理”。
    东京电台说，石桥主张重新研究新“安全条约”问题，松村和石桥的想法基本上一致。松村认为，岸信介首相的外交政策将使日本同中国、苏联的关系恶化，使日本成为远东的孤儿。他认为不应该强行签署新日美“安全条约”。
    松村还提出批评说，把金门、马祖岛包括在新日美“安全条约”适用范围“远东”地区内，“对今后的日中关系来说是不好的”。据报道，被认为松村—三木派的活动家古井喜实今天访问了自由民主党政务调查会长船田中，指出新“安全条约”适用范围包括金门、马祖岛在内，将使日中关系进一步恶化，应当重新考虑。
    在日本人民反对新日美“安全条约”运动日益高涨、要求改善日中和日苏关系的呼声更加响亮的潮流的冲击下，日本自由民主党内部的非当权派反对岸信介集团的动态，在日本引起了各方面的注意。
    共同社2日评论说，自由民主党内阻止岸信介第三次当选总裁的动态和要求改善日中、日苏关系的动态结合在一起，将随着新“安全条约”的正式审议而逐渐活跃起来。石桥、松村—三木等非当权派的中坚议员已经在准备成立“打倒岸信介”议员联合组织，这说明自由民主党内的对立逐渐更加尖锐了。
