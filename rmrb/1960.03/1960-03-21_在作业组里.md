    In the Work Team
    Four Diary Entries
    Zhao Yangcheng, First Secretary of the CPC Changsha County Committee, Hunan Province
    February 5th
    Today is the Beginning of Spring.
    In the early morning, I departed from the Lotus Commune Party Committee, stepping into the brilliant sunshine, facing the gentle spring breeze, along the wide road, through the fields with fluttering red flags, and arrived at the Fifth Work Team of the First Production Team of the Golden Phoenix Brigade.
    Here, male and female commune members, in groups of three or five, were busy making dike embankments, shoveling sod, and applying topdressing fertilizer in the shimmering paddy fields, on the hills with waving red flags, and in the rapeseed fields blooming with yellow flowers. I also enthusiastically joined their ranks of labor, and talked with them about production and daily life. It was not until the red sun set and the work bell rang that I happily walked towards the public canteen with the commune members and had dinner with them.
    Yesterday, Comrade He Changchun, the Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, told me that the Golden Phoenix Brigade was a relatively backward brigade, with low labor efficiency and slow progress in spring plowing. Why is the work here behind other areas? From my participation in labor with the members of the Fifth Work Team of the First Production Team of this brigade, close conversations, and careful observations, I found its root cause: First, labor was not concentrated on the main front of agriculture. Second, this year's production plan was still at the commune and brigade level and had not been communicated to the work team cadres and members. Third, the reason for the low labor efficiency was mainly the lack of tool reform and the formulation of labor quotas. Fourth, the cadres of the brigade and production team were still at the stage of general meeting calls and had not gone deep into the work teams to the fields to study and solve practical problems.
    In the evening, based on this situation, I held a forum with the cadres of the brigade and production team, as well as the cadres and members of the work team, and repeatedly expounded the policy of "taking grain as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward," emphasizing that leaders and cadres at all levels must go deep into the front line, concentrate superior forces, vigorously carry out tool reform, and quickly set off a production upsurge centered on manure accumulation. At the same time, I specifically helped the Fifth Work Team formulate labor quotas and remuneration standards, planned fertilizer sources, and arranged the agricultural work for the next few days. The members were all in high spirits and expressed their determination to devote themselves to the spring plowing production movement centered on manure accumulation with greater vigor.
    February 8th
    I have been eating, living, and working with the members of the Fifth Work Team of the First Production Team of the Golden Phoenix Brigade of the Lotus Commune for four full days. Now, the production outlook of this work team has greatly changed. The number of workers in the whole team accounts for 100% of the total labor force; the production plan has also been implemented to the plots, and a responsibility system has been established; the members are in high spirits and are enthusiastically engaged in the manure accumulation movement. The leadership style of the Golden Phoenix Brigade cadres has also undergone great changes. All eleven cadres of the brigade headquarters, except for one secretary on duty in the office, have gone deep into the work teams to study production and work together with the members. Now, all grassroots cadres at the brigade production team and work team levels are working in the fields during the day and studying production and work in the evening. Comrade Xing Yuchao, the Secretary of the Brigade General Branch, went deep into the Second Work Team of the First Production Team, took off his shoes and socks, and worked with the members, talking to them and learning that the cadres and members of this team were not clear about the policy of "taking grain as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward." The team had 103 mu of paddy fields with good water conservancy conditions, but only planned to plant 52 mu of double-cropping rice and also planned to plant 5 mu of vegetables in the paddy fields. The reasons they were unwilling to plant double-cropping rice were, first, they were afraid of insufficient fertilizer, and second, they were afraid of labor shortages. In response to these ideas, Comrade Xing Yuchao, in addition to conducting individual education and explanation, also held a forum to publicize the great significance of "taking grain as the key link and achieving an all-round leap forward," and studied ways to solve the problems of fertilizer and labor shortages with the members. The members were all satisfied.
    The commune members wrote such a folk song, vividly praising the promotion and encouragement role of leaders going deep into production:
    The secretary carries manure and walks in the front,
    The captain follows closely behind,
    The branch secretary's head is covered in sweat,
    The members' enthusiasm soars to the sky.
    February 29th
    Today, I and two comrades from the County Party Committee Office had breakfast in the Dongyang Brigade of the Qiaoyi Commune, which is surrounded by mountains, and climbed over the Fengpeng Ridge, which soared into the clouds. After walking more than ten li, we arrived at the Beishan Commune. When we stepped into the gate of the commune office, Comrade Yang Yulin, a member of the County Party Committee and Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, was carefully writing a report, preparing to convey the spirit of the Second Session of the Second Municipal Party Congress at the General Branch Secretary's meeting to be held in the evening. After a short rest, he briefly introduced the tool reform situation in Beishan Commune. After lunch, we went to the Third Work Team of the Pioneer Production Team of the Beishan Brigade.
    Walking into this mountain village, a busy scene of spring plowing and large-scale production was unfolding before our eyes. On the hillside, where the red flag was waving, a chute extended down the mountain; a group of young girls, with hearty laughter, carried black mud and poured it into the chute, which poured down with a gurgling sound. At the foot of the mountain, a group of young men, humming melodious tunes, pushed "earth trains" and dragged "land boats," fully loaded with fertile mud, rushing to the fields. In front of the village, people were shouting at the cattle, carefully plowing the fields in the paddy fields filled with spring water. Here, everywhere was a scene of vigorous development that made people feel excited.
    We stepped into the gate of the public canteen, the courtyard was swept clean; all kinds of furniture were arranged neatly; red and green slogans and poems praising the canteen written by the members were pasted on the snow-white walls.
    We put down our luggage and, without taking a break, asked Comrade Yi Changxing, the secretary of the Party branch, to lead us to visit the canteen's dining hall and kitchen. As soon as we entered the clean kitchen, the first thing we saw was a clear spring water, continuously flowing through a bamboo pipe into the water tank and pot. Cook Xiong Dasao said with a smile: "This is tap water. In the past, I had to carry water by myself from dawn to dusk, and I was so tired that my back couldn't straighten up, and the pot often ran dry. Now, one person is not needed at all." She couldn't restrain the joy in her heart and led us to visit the rice washing machine, vegetable cutting machine, rice measuring device, and dishwashing machine. At this time, Comrade Yi Changxing told us: the rice washing machine can improve the efficiency of rice washing by three times compared with manual washing, and it can be done without sand, barnyard grass, and impurities. The total amount of vegetables eaten by 114 people in the whole canteen a day, and the green fodder needed by 48 pigs a day, is more than 1,000 jin. It used to take two laborers to cut them by hand, and they couldn't even finish it in a day. Now, it only takes two hours to cut them all. Originally, it took two people two hours to wash the rice bowls and vegetable bowls after each meal. Now, with the dishwashing machine, one person can wash them clean in forty minutes; if more than 100 people eat rice, if we follow the old method of measuring it tube by tube, it is both troublesome and time-consuming. Now, with the rice measuring device, it is both uniform and convenient, and the work efficiency is increased by three times. As soon as Comrade Yi Changxing's words fell, Xiong Dasao interrupted and said: "Originally, it took five people to cook tea and rice for more than 110 people in the canteen, and they were still too busy. Now, it only takes two people, and it's still very easy!"
    I like these simple, exquisite, efficient, and low-cost new cooking utensils very much. I tried these new tools. And after careful discussion and research with the cooks, I put forward some improvement suggestions for these new cooking utensils. Comrade Yi Changxing, the secretary of the Party branch, immediately asked the carpenter to modify them according to our opinions. The cooks unanimously reflected that the modified cooking utensils were lighter and more flexible than before.
    In the evening, we convened some members to discuss the situation of the large-scale tool and cooking utensil reform in this team, and learned that after the tool and cooking utensil reform here, not only was the labor efficiency greatly improved and labor was saved, but also people's mental outlook was greatly changed. Listen to what the female member Wang Xiangren said: "In the past, when we carried shoulder poles, our shoulders were swollen and our clothes were worn out; now, with the new tools, it's easy and effortless, and we don't feel tired. In the evening, we all strive to learn politics and culture. I didn't even recognize my own name before, but now I can write, calculate, and sing!" Yes, more than a dozen young and middle-aged illiterate and semi-illiterate people in this work team, like Wang Xiangren, can now write, calculate, and sing. Look! The following poem is their enthusiastic praise for the tool reform:
    Tool reform flowers bloom,
    Production leap forward brings happiness,
    Thanks to the Party's good leadership,
    The members are all happy.
    The Third Work Team of the Pioneer Production Team is a thoroughbred in tool and cooking utensil reform, and is a glorious example for more than 16,000 work teams in the county. Although it was already past 9 p.m., we still seized the time to hold a telephone conference for the Party committee secretaries of all communes in the county, and introduced in detail the tool and cooking utensil reform situation and experience of this team, and called on the whole county to learn from this work team.
    March 1st
    One night of spring breeze, flowers filled the branches, and the Party's call received a hundred responses. The news that the Third Work Team of the Pioneer Production Team had done a very good job in tool and cooking utensil reform quickly spread throughout the county. Today, more than 100 representatives from Shaping, Qiaojiao, Gutang, Fulin, Dinggong, Wangyue, Kaihui and other communes came to visit and study. People who came to visit and study, applauded the newly made tools and cooking utensils, they looked at them again and again, tried them again and again, asked again and again, drew patterns, measured sizes, and were not sloppy at all. We can fully believe that with the correct leadership of the Party and the soaring enthusiasm of the masses, the advanced seeds of tool and cooking utensil reform of the Third Work Team of the Pioneer Production Team will soon be sown throughout the county, and it will bloom more brilliant flowers and bear more beautiful and abundant fruits.

    在作业组里
    日记四则
    中共湖南长沙县委第一书记  赵阳城
    二月五日
    今日立春。
    清晨，我从莲花公社党委会出发，踏着灿烂的阳光，迎着徐徐的春风，沿着宽阔的公路，穿过红旗飘舞的田垅，来到了金凤大队第一生产队第五作业组。
    这里，男女社员，三五成群地在银光闪闪的水田里，在红旗招展的山岗上，在黄花盛开的油菜地里，正忙着作凼埂，铲草皮，施追肥。我也兴致勃勃地参加了他们的劳动行列，并且和他们谈生产、拉家常。直到红日西下，收工号响，才又和社员们一道，愉快地走向公共食堂，和他们共进晚餐。
    昨天，公社党委书记何长春同志告诉我，金凤大队是一个较为后进的大队，劳动工效不高，春耕进度缓慢。为什么这里的工作比其他地区后进呢？从我和这个大队第一生产队第五作业组的社员一道参加劳动，亲切交谈和细心观察的过程中，找到了它的根子：第一、劳动力没有集中到农业主攻战线上来。第二、今年的生产计划还停留在公社、大队一级，没有与作业组干部和社员见面。第三、劳动工效不高的原因主要是没有进行工具改革和制定劳动定额。第四、大队和生产队的干部，还停留在一般会议号召上，没有深入到作业组到田间去研究和解决实际问题。
    晚上，我根据这一情况，召开了大队、生产队的干部和作业组的干部、社员座谈会，反复阐述了：“以粮为纲、全面跃进”的方针，强调各级领导和干部，必须深入第一线，集中优势兵力，大搞工具改革，迅速掀起以积肥为中心的生产高潮。同时，具体帮助第五作业组制定了劳动定额和报酬标准，规划了肥源，安排了最近几天的农活，社员们个个情绪高涨，都表示以更大的干劲，投入以积肥为中心的春耕生产运动。
    二月八日
    我到莲花公社金凤大队第一生产队第五作业组和社员同吃、同住、同劳动，整整四天了。现在，这个作业组的生产面貌已大大改观。全组出工人数，占总劳力的百分之百；生产计划也落实到丘，并建立了责任制度；社员们情绪高涨，正热火朝天地大闹积肥运动。金凤大队干部的领导作风，也有了很大的改变。大队部十一个干部，除留秘书一人在办公室值日外，其他的同志都深入到了作业组，和社员共同研究生产和工作。全大队生产队和作业组一级的基层干部，现在，都做到了白天生产，晚上研究生产和工作。大队总支书记邢玉超同志，深入第一生产队第二作业组，脱下鞋袜，和社员一同劳动，一边谈心，了解到这个组的干部和社员对“以粮为纲，全面跃进”的方针不明确，全组有一百零三亩水田，水利条件较好，但只计划种五十二亩双季稻，还计划在水田里种五亩蔬菜。他们不愿种双季稻的原因，一是怕肥料不足，二是怕劳力紧张。针对这些思想，邢玉超同志除个别进行教育解释外，还召开了座谈会，宣传了“以粮为纲，全面跃进”的伟大意义，和社员们一起研究了解决肥料，劳力不足的办法，社员个个满意。
    社员写了这样一首山歌，生动地歌颂领导深入对生产所起的推动和鼓舞作用：
    书记运粪走在前，
    队长紧紧跟后边，
    支书满头流大汗，
    社员干劲更冲天。
    二月二十九日
    今天，我和县委办公室两个同志，在桥驿公社山峦重叠的洞阳大队吃了早饭，翻越耸入云际的风蓬岭，再步行十多华里，便到了北山公社。我们跨进公社办公室的大门时，县委委员、公社党委书记杨玉林同志正在精心地写报告，准备在晚上召开的总支书记会议上，传达市二届党代大会第二次会议精神。我们休息片刻后，他简要地介绍了北山公社工具改革的情况。午餐以后，我们就到了北山大队先锋生产队第三作业组。
    走进这个山村，一幅春耕大生产的繁忙景象，展现在眼前。山腰，红旗飘处，一条溜槽，伸向山下；一群年轻的姑娘带着爽朗的笑声，挑着乌黑的泥巴，倒入溜槽，哗哗地向下倾泻。山下，一群小伙子，哼着悦耳的小调，推着“土火车”，拖着“陆地船”，满装着肥泥，奔向田间。村前，人们?喝着牛儿，在春水飘飘的稻田里，精心地翻耕田地。这里，处处是令人感到兴奋的欣欣向荣的景象。
    我们踏进公共食堂的大门，院子里，扫得干干净净；各种家具，安放得整整齐齐；雪白的墙上，贴着红红绿绿的标语和社员们赞美食堂的诗篇。
    我们放下了行装，顾不上休息，就请党支部书记易长兴同志领着我们参观了食堂的饭厅、厨房。一走进整洁的厨房，第一眼就看见一股清清的泉水，经过一个竹管，不断地流往水缸、锅里。炊事员熊大嫂笑嘻嘻地说：“这是自来水，过去，我一个人挑水，从天光到断黑，累得驼子不伸腰，锅里还经常遭干，现在，一个人也用不着了。”她按捺不住心头的喜悦，领着我们参观了掏米机、切菜机、量米器和洗碗器。这时，易长兴同志告诉我们：掏米机要比人工掏米提高工效三倍，而且做到了无砂、无稗、无杂质。全食堂一百一十四人一天吃的蔬菜，和四十八头猪一天所需要的青料，一共有一千多斤，原先用手切要占用两个劳力，一天还转脚不来，现在，只花两小时就切完了。原来每餐饭后，要两个人两小时洗饭碗菜钵，现在有洗碗器，只用一个人在四十分钟内就洗得干干净净；一百多人吃的米，如果按照原先的老办法，一筒一筒去量，既麻烦又耽误时间，现在用量米器，又均匀又便利，提高工效三倍。易长兴同志的话刚落音，熊大嫂子又抢着说：“食堂里一百一十多人，原先用五个人烧茶煮饭，还忙不过来，现在只用两个人，还很松快哩！”
    我十分喜欢这些简单、精巧、工效高、成本低的新炊具。我试用了这些新工具。并且和炊事员精心商量研究后，对这些新炊具又提出了一些改进意见。党支部书记易长兴同志根据我们的意见，立即请木工进行了修改。炊事员一致反映修改后的炊具，比以前更轻巧灵活了。
    晚上，我们召集了部分社员座谈了这个组大闹工具和炊具改革的情况，了解到这里进行工具和炊具改革以后，不仅大大提高了劳动工效，节省了劳力，而且，人们的精神面貌，也随着大大改变了。你听妇女社员王香仁说吧：“过去，我们挑扁担，肩膀压肿，衣服磨烂；如今使用新工具，轻轻巧巧，不觉得疲倦，晚上，都争取学政治、学文化。以前我连自己的名字都不认得，现在，会写会算，还会唱歌哩！”是的，这个作业组十多个青壮年文盲和半文盲，如今，也都和王香仁一样，会写、会算、会唱歌了。看吧！下面这首诗歌，就是他们对工具改革的热情歌颂：
    工具改革鲜花开，
    生产跃进幸福来，
    感谢党的领导好，
    社员个个乐开怀。
    先锋生产队第三作业组是工具和炊具改革中的千里马，是全县一万六千多个作业组的光辉榜样。虽然是晚上九点多钟了，我们还是抓紧时间，召开了全县各公社党委书记电话会议，详细介绍了这个组的工具、炊具改革的情况和经验，号召全县向这个作业组学习。
    三月一日
    一夜春风，花满枝头，党的号召，一呼百应，先锋生产队第三作业组工具、炊具改革搞得十分出色的消息，很快就在全县传开了。今天，前来参观学习的，有沙坪、桥骄、谷塘、福临、顶功、望岳、开慧等公社的代表一百多人。前来参观学习的人们，对于这里新制的工具和炊具，人人拍手称好，他们看了又看，试了又试，问了又问，绘图样，量尺寸，丝毫不苟。我们完全可以相信，有了党的正确领导，有了群众冲天的干劲，先锋生产队第三作业组工具、炊具改革的先进种子即将遍播全县，它将开出更加灿烂的鲜花，结出更美更丰硕的果实。
