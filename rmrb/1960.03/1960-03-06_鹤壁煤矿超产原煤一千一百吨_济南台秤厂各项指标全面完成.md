　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 5th. The workers of Hebi Coal Mine have completed the first quarter's raw coal production plan ahead of schedule. As of March 1st, the mine's cumulative raw coal production this year has exceeded the first quarter's plan by 1,140 tons.

　　Since the beginning of this year, Hebi Coal Mine has attached particular importance to political and ideological work, mobilizing the masses to summarize and evaluate, enabling all employees to establish the ambition to strive for the top, catch up with the advanced, and strive for a good start to the year. In January, the monthly plan was completed thirteen days ahead of schedule, breaking the conventional relaxation of production at the beginning of the year. Entering February, they put forward the slogan of continuing to rush forward and strive for the top everywhere, launching a mass movement of high work efficiency, low cost, safety assurance, and overproduction. The mine's workers have been actively engaged in technological innovation, with more than 20 types of work and more than 170 pacesetters spreading experience and visiting each mine, which has powerfully promoted the overall leap forward in production. In terms of pit prop consumption, due to the vigorous organization of the use of cement supports and other pit prop substitutes, the pit prop consumption quota has been reduced. Pit prop consumption in January and February decreased by 24.7% compared with the fourth quarter of last year, achieving the requirement of increased production without increased materials. The widespread adoption of coal loading machines has further promoted the mechanization of coal loading, tunneling, and transportation.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 5th. The workers of Jinan Weighing Scale Factory have continuously broken through key production points in the technological innovation movement, making production leap forward again and again. By the end of February, they had fully completed the first quarter's production plan ahead of schedule. The completion of various indicators is as follows: total output value 108.56%, labor productivity 108.56%, and weighing scale output 110.54%. All product quality meets national standards, and cost and profit have also completed or overfulfilled the first quarter's plan.

　　Under the leadership of the Party, all employees of this factory are determined to double production this year. The main key production issues are poor technology and equipment conditions, with manual operation accounting for more than 40%. In response to this situation, the factory's Party organization led the masses in a large-scale movement of mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations at the beginning of this year. More than 90% of the factory's employees participated in this movement. In January and February alone, 388 technological innovations were achieved, 19 sets of special equipment were manufactured to replace manual operations, two single machines were automated and semi-automated, and four assembly lines were built, which rapidly increased the factory's degree of mechanization to more than 75%. Technological innovation has greatly improved production efficiency. For example, the scale ruler drilling machine improved by fitter Zhang Lianyuan could complete a day's work in ten minutes. After the completion of the scale ruler processing assembly line, the number of processes was reduced from seventeen to fourteen, and the number of operators was reduced from twenty-three to fifteen. Therefore, the early completion of the first quarter plan was guaranteed.

    鹤壁煤矿超产原煤一千一百吨
    济南台秤厂各项指标全面完成
    新华社郑州5日电　鹤壁煤矿职工提前完成了第一季度原煤生产计划。到3月1日止，全矿今年的累计原煤产量，已超过第一季度计划一千一百四十吨。
    今年以来，鹤壁煤矿特别重视政治思想工作，发动群众总结评比，使全体职工树立了争上游、赶先进、力争开年红的雄心大志。1月份提前十三天完成了月计划，打破了历年生产年初松的常规。进入2月，他们又提出继续往前赶、处处争上游的口号，掀起了高工效、低成本、保安全、多超产的群众运动。全矿职工大闹技术革新，有二十多个工种、一百七十多名标兵分别到各矿传播经验，参观访问，有力地推动了生产的全面跃进。在坑木消耗方面，由于大力组织使用水泥支架等坑木代用品，降低了坑木消耗定额，1、2月份坑木消耗比去年第四季度降低24．7％，达到了增产不增料的要求。攉煤机的广泛采用，也进一步促进了装煤、掘进和运输的机械化。
    新华社济南5日电　济南台秤制造厂职工在技术革新运动中不断突破生产关键，使生产一跃再跃，到2月底已经提前全面完成了第一季度生产计划。各项指标完成的情况是：总产值108．56％，劳动生产率108．56％，台秤产量110．54％。产品质量全部合乎国家标准，成本和利润也都完成或超额完成了第一季度计划。
    这个厂的全体职工，在党的领导下，今年立志要使生产增加一倍半。主要的生产关键是技术、设备条件差，手工操作占40％以上。工厂党组织针对这一情况，今年一开始就领导群众大搞手工操作机械化半机械化运动。全厂90％以上的职工都参加了这一运动，1、2两月份就实现技术革新三百八十八项，制造了十九台代替手工操作的专用设备，使两台单机实现了自动化和半自动化，建成了四条流水生产线，使全厂的机械化程度迅速达到75％以上。技术革新使生产效率大大提高。如钳工张连元改进的磅尺打眼机，用十分钟就干完了一天的活。磅尺加工流水生产线建成后，由十七道工序减为十四道，由二十三人操作减为十五人。因此，保证了首季计划提前完成。
