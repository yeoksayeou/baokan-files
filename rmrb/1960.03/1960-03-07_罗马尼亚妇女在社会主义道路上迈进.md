    Romanian Women March Forward on the Socialist Road
    Miia Groza, Secretary of the Romanian National Women's Council
    Half a century has passed since women all over the world decided to celebrate their own international holiday, International Women's Day, on March 8th in early spring every year.
    Fifty years have passed, but during this period, how many fundamental changes have taken place that have greatly changed the social situation and status of women! The great October Socialist Revolution opened the road to a free life for Russian women for the first time in the world, giving them the same rights as men as human beings. This example inspired women all over the world who were fighting for freedom and equal rights. After the Second World War, in many other countries—in the People's Republic of China, Romania, and other countries, women have embarked on the road of socialism and have also become people who enjoy the same equal rights as men and live a new life.
    As we, the women of the Romanian People's Republic, celebrate the 50th anniversary of International Women's Day, our country is striding forward in socialist construction. As women who fully enjoy all the rights conferred by the people's democratic regime, on this day we should recall the long and arduous road that Romanian women, together with the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Communists, took in the struggle to seek the happy life they enjoy today before liberation.
    Before liberation, Romanian women suffered heavy oppression. Even the country's constitution did not regard women as citizens and completely deprived them of their political rights.
    On August 23, 1944, in the victorious situation of the glorious Soviet army's anti-fascist war, when the patriotic armed forces led by the Communist Party overthrew the fascist military dictatorship, countless Romanian women took up arms and participated in the people's armed uprising. For Romanian women, August 23, 1944, not only marked their liberation from fascist enslavement, but also from a century of slavery and from the humble status of living that tragic life in the past.
    The liberation of the motherland opened up a new and bright prospect for women to move towards a better life. Today, women's rights are guaranteed by the people's national system. The state creates all conditions for women to exert their strength.
    Romanian women play an important role in national life. Today, there are seventy-one women representatives and two members of the Presidium of the Great National Assembly. In the People's Assembly—local state power organs—there are 35,082 women representatives contributing their strength to the management of the local economy, state jurisdiction, cities and villages. Women also hold important positions in state organs and economic departments.
    In the great cause of building socialism, Romanian women have exerted their creative power. In all industrial sectors, they have devoted themselves to socialist emulation, adopting advanced methods, and realizing technological innovation. In some economic sectors, such as light industry and the food industry, women play a decisive role in production, because they account for the vast majority of the workforce in these sectors. The Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej Garment Factory in Bucharest, where about 70% of the wage earners are women, is an example that can illustrate the problem. Last year, this factory won the "Enterprise Pioneer" Red Flag for the eleventh time.
    Rural working women have made significant contributions to the socialist transformation of agriculture. Women are working hard to increase grain production and increase the number of public livestock. They are actively strengthening collective farms economically and organizationally.
    In the People's Republic of Romania, the door to culture is open to all women. At present, female students account for one-third of all young people studying in various specialized colleges. In institutions of higher learning, there are 2,100 female professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants. More than 60% of those working in education, the place with the most intellectuals in Romania, are women.
    Nearly seventy women have been awarded national prizes and honorary titles for their outstanding achievements in the fields of art, literature, science, education, and sports.
    More than 11,000 women have been awarded various medals and decorations.
    Determined to build a new and happy life in peace together with our people across the country, the women of the Romanian People's Republic most resolutely support the peaceful policies of our government. Due to the common ideals of peace and progress, they are with women all over the world and do their best to strengthen their friendly relations with their sisters all over the world.
    A few years ago, I had the opportunity to visit the People's Republic of China. I often excitedly recall the days I spent in your hospitable country. There, I felt great inner excitement about every great achievement of your great people.
    On the 50th anniversary of International Women's Day, we sincerely wish our sisters in the People's Republic of China new and brilliant achievements in building a happy, prosperous, and peaceful life.

    罗马尼亚妇女在社会主义道路上迈进
    罗马尼亚全国妇女理事会书记  米亚·格罗查
    自从全世界妇女决定在每年3月8日早春时节的这一天庆祝她们自己的国际节日以来，半个世纪已经过去了。
    五十年已经过去了，但是在这期间共发生了多少大大地改变妇女们在社会上的处境和地位的根本性质的变化啊！伟大的十月社会主义革命在世界上第一次为俄国妇女们打开了走向自由生活的道路，赋予她们作为人的同男人平等的权利。这一事例鼓舞了为自由和权利平等而斗争着的全世界妇女。第二次世界大战以后，在另外的许多国家里——在中华人民共和国、罗马尼亚和其他国家里，妇女们已经走上了社会主义的道路，也成为享有同男人一样的平等权利和过着新生活的人们。
    我们罗马尼亚人民共和国的妇女们在庆祝国际妇女节五十周年的时候，正当我国大踏步地进行着社会主义建设。作为充分地享受着人民民主政权所赋予的种种权利的妇女，在这一天就要回忆起在获得自由以前，罗马尼亚妇女们同全国人民一道在共产党人的领导下为了谋求目前享受着的这种幸福生活而进行斗争时所走过的漫长和艰苦的道路。
    解放以前，罗马尼亚妇女遭受重重的压迫。甚至国家的宪法都不把妇女当作公民，完全剥夺了她们的政治权利。
    1944年8月23日在光荣的苏军反法西斯战争的胜利形势下，当共产党所领导的爱国武装部队推翻了法西斯军事独裁政权时，无数的罗马尼亚妇女拿起武器参加了人民的武装起义。对于罗马尼亚妇女来说，1944年8月23日不只是表明她们从法西斯奴役下解放出来，而且是从一百年来的奴隶制度下、从过去过着那种悲惨生活的低贱地位下解放出来。
    祖国的解放为妇女展开了新的、走向美好生活的光辉前景。今天妇女的权利受到人民国家制度的保证。国家为妇女发挥她们的力量创造了一切条件。
    罗马尼亚妇女在国家生活中发挥着重大的作用，今天在大国民议会中有七十一个妇女代表和两个大国民议会主席团委员。在人民议会中——地方国家权力机关——有三万五千零八十二个妇女代表为管理地方经济、国家管辖区、城市和乡村贡献出她们的力量。妇女还在国家机关和经济部门中担任着重要的职位。
    在建设社会主义的伟大事业里，罗马尼亚妇女们发挥了她们的创造力量。在所有的工业部门中，她们投身到社会主义竞赛中去，采用先进方法，实现技术革新。在一些经济部门中，例如轻工业与食品工业，妇女在生产上起了决定性的作用，因为她们占了这些部门工作人数的绝大部分。布加勒斯特乔治乌—德治成衣制造厂，那里拿工资的人约有70％是妇女。这是一个能说明问题的例子。去年，这个工厂已经第十一次获得了“企业先锋”红旗。
    农村劳动妇女对农业的社会主义改造作出了重大贡献。妇女们为了提高粮食产量与增加公共牲畜头数而努力。她们积极地从经济上和组织上加强集体农庄。
    在人民的罗马尼亚，文化的大门向一切妇女敞开。目前，女学生占全体在各种专科学院学习的青年的三分之一。在高等学府中，有二千一百名女教授、女讲师和女助教。在罗马尼亚知识分子最多的地方——教育机关工作的，60％以上是妇女。
    为了她们在艺术、文学、科学、教育、运动等领域中的杰出功绩，将近有七十个妇女获得了国家奖金和荣誉称号。
    一万一千多名妇女已经获得各种勋章和奖章。
    由于决心要和我们全国人民一道在和平中建立起一个新的幸福的生活，罗马尼亚人民共和国的妇女们最坚决地支持我们政府的和平政策。她们由于和平和进步的共同理想，和全世界的妇女在一起，并且尽她们的力量为加强她们和全世界的姊妹们的友好关系而作出贡献。
    几年前，我有机会访问了中华人民共和国。我常常激动地回忆在你们好客的国家度过的日子。在那里，对于你们伟大人民的每一巨大成就我都感到内心的极大激动。
    在国际妇女节五十周年的时候，我们衷心地祝中华人民共和国的姊妹们在建设一个幸福繁荣与和平的生活的时候取得新的光辉的成就。
