    Related to the Fate of All Mankind
    Lin Ling
    Forty years ago, when Lenin spoke of the awakening of the Eastern peoples, he said, "The peoples of the East are beginning to participate in deciding the destiny of the whole world, so as not to be simply objects of enrichment. ... They demand that they should be able to participate in deciding the destiny of all mankind."
    Lenin's words have been verified in Asia, and today the people of Latin America are also embarking on this path.
    The awakened people recognize their situation, their future, and their enemies. Awakening generates will, and will generates power. The awakened people unite, determined to change their bitter situation and strive for their bright future. The awakened people not only want to solve their own destiny, but also want to intervene in the destiny of all mankind.
    The "Week of Support for the Latin American People," initiated by sixty-six parties and people's organizations in Latin American countries, not only demonstrates the awakening of the 200 million people of Latin America, but also demonstrates their will to unite and struggle, and especially, their determination to intervene in the destiny of mankind.
    The awakened 200 million people of Latin America are determined to unite and support each other, first of all to support the Cuban people, who stand at the forefront of the struggle, in their fight for independence, and to prevent US imperialism from treating them as an object of enrichment. Progressive people all over the world will support them in unison. The 650 million Chinese people have already expressed their determination to stand with the Cuban and Latin American people and support their just struggle. The just cause of the liberation struggle of oppressed people is related to the fate of mankind. The people of socialist countries will certainly stand with the Latin American people. The people who have just been liberated from colonial status are also supporting them, and the people of Asia and Africa who are currently engaged in liberation struggles will of course stand on the same front with them. Thus, standing with the Latin American people are 2.3 billion people from all over humanity, and the vast majority of the 400 million people in imperialist countries will also support the noble cause of the Latin American people. From the perspective of the world's popular sentiment, this is the situation.
    Who are we opposing in supporting the Latin American people? The enemy of the Latin American people is US imperialism. Progressive people all over the world support the Latin American people in opposing US imperialism. In other words, US imperialism is the common enemy of progressive people all over the world.
    When the awakened people stand up to take control of their own destiny, they will inevitably intervene in the destiny of all mankind. The specific manifestation of this intervention is the mutual support of the Latin American people, the support of the Chinese people for the Latin American people, the support of the entire socialist camp, the support of the Asian and African people, and the support of the vast majority of progressive people around the world.
    US imperialism originally thought that Latin America was confined to its "backyard," that it could arbitrarily manipulate the people of Latin America, and firmly believed that no intervention could come from Europe, Asia, or Africa. However, once the people awaken, they will unite and, under correct leadership and with common struggle slogans, form an irresistible force. No matter how you confine them to the "backyard," they will rise up bravely to take control of their own destiny, and even intervene in the destiny of all mankind. The awakened people of Europe, Asia, and Africa, even if they are far away from this "backyard," will never stand idly by without intervening. Because this is a matter related to the fate of all mankind.
    In the face of this situation, the fate of US imperialism is pitiful: its "backyard" has become a "front line," because the awakened people in the "backyard" will not allow US imperialism to treat them as an object of enrichment and oppression and exploitation any longer. They want to become people who can control their own destiny. And the people of the United States itself will not only support the Latin American people, but will also awaken and fight to take control of their own destiny.
    The people of every awakened nation will not only take control of their own destiny, but will also intervene in the destiny of all mankind, because the destiny of all mankind is indivisible. It is precisely because of this that the days of US imperialism are getting worse and worse. It is facing enemies on all sides, and its future is bleak. Not to mention whether its financial fortune of getting rich can be prosperous.
    The storm of national democratic revolution in Latin America has already resounded. A new Latin America where people are their own masters will be born. This great storm will toll a new death knell for the moribund US imperialism.

    关系全人类的命运
    林陵
    远在四十年前，列宁谈到东方人民觉醒的时候，曾经说过这样的话：“东方各族人民开始干预世界命运而不再仅仅充当别人发财的对象了。……他们要求实际行动起来，要求每一族人民都能干预全人类的命运问题”。
    列宁这几句话已在亚洲得到印证了，今天的拉丁美洲人民，又在走向这条道路。
    觉醒了的人民，认识了自己的处境，认识了自己的前途，也认识了自己的敌人。觉醒产生意志，意志产生力量。觉醒了的人民团结起来，决心改变自己的悲苦处境，争取自己的光明前途。觉醒了的人民不仅要解决自己的命运，而且还要干预全人类的命运。
    拉丁美洲各国六十六个党派和人民团体发起举行的“支援拉丁美洲人民周”，不仅表现了拉丁美洲二亿人民的觉醒，也表现了他们团结和斗争的意志，尤其是，还表现了他们干预人类命运的决心。
    觉醒的拉丁美洲二亿人民，决心团结起来互相支援，首先是支援站在斗争最前线的古巴人民争取独立，不再让美帝国主义把它当作发财的对象。世界各国进步人民，都将同声支援，六亿五千万中国人民已经表示决心站在古巴和拉丁美洲人民方面，支援他们的正义斗争。被压迫人民的解放斗争的正义事业，关系人类的命运，社会主义国家的人民一定会站在拉丁美洲人民方面，刚从殖民地地位中解放出来的人民也在支持他们，正在进行解放斗争的亚洲和非洲的人民当然也会和他们站在一条战线上。这样，和拉丁美洲人民站在一起的是全人类中的二十三亿人口，而帝国主义国家的四亿人口，绝大多数也一定会支持拉丁美洲人民的崇高事业。从世界人心背向的角度来看，形势就是这样。
    支持拉丁美洲人民，反对谁呢？拉丁美洲人民的敌人是美帝国主义。全世界进步人民支援拉丁美洲人民反对美帝国主义。也就是说，美帝国主义是全世界进步人民的共同敌人。
    觉醒的人民站起来掌握自己命运的时候，也必然要干预全人类的命运，这种干预的具体表现就是拉丁美洲人民的互相支援，中国人民对拉丁美洲人民的支援，整个社会主义阵营的支援，亚非人民的支援以及全世界绝大多数进步人类的支援。
    美帝国主义原以为拉丁美洲圈在它的“后院”，可以把拉丁美洲的人民任意摆布，并且深信不可能有任何干预来自欧洲、亚洲或非洲。然而，人民一旦觉醒，他们就会团结起来，在正确的领导下，在共同的斗争口号下，形成不可抗御的力量，无论你怎样把他们关禁在“后院”里，他们也会奋不顾身地起来掌握自己的命运，进而至于干预全人类的命运。欧洲、亚洲、非洲的觉醒了的人民，即使离开这个“后院”很远，也决不会袖手旁观而不加干预。因为这是关系到全人类命运的问题。
    在这种形势面前，美帝国主义的命运就可悲了：它的“后院”变成了“前线”，因为“后院”里觉醒了的人民不容许美帝国主义再把他们当作发财的对象而加以压迫和剥削，他们要变成能掌握自己命运的人。而美国本国的人民，不但支援拉丁美洲人民，并且也将觉醒起来为掌握自己的命运而斗争。
    每一个觉醒了的民族的人民，不但要掌握自己的命运，还将干预全人类的命运，因为全人类的命运是不可分割的。也正由于这样，美帝国主义的日子就一天比一天不好过了。它遇到的是四面楚歌，它的前途一片黯淡。更不用说发财致富的财运是否能亨通了。
    拉丁美洲民族民主革命的风暴已经响起来，自己当家作主的新拉丁美洲就将诞生，这个大风暴，将为日暮途穷的美帝国主义敲响新的丧钟。
