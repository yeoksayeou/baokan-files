    Fight the First Battle Well in Spring
    Disease prevention and elimination is an important measure to promote production. It protects the most valuable asset of the country -- labor -- and thus creates favorable conditions for high-speed development of production. The Shanxin People's Commune in Yulin County, Guangxi, closely integrates sanitation work with production. While strengthening the management of manure, it implements planned fertilizer application, which not only meets harmless requirements but also improves fertilizer efficiency. In Kaili County, Guizhou Province, thanks to the good work in malaria prevention, production has been effectively guaranteed. In 1958, the county's grain output increased by 108% compared with 1957, and last year it increased by another 181.6% compared with 1958. In Junko People's Commune, Jianning County, Fujian Province, more than 6,300 filariasis patients have been cured in the past year or so, increasing the commune's labor days by more than 397,000. These vivid facts tell us that as long as we adhere to production as the center and carry out health campaigns from the perspective of production, health and production can promote each other. The development of production drives the development of health undertakings, and the development of health undertakings, in turn, is a necessary condition for ensuring the smooth progress of production. The two are dialectically unified.
    The principle that hygiene serves production and production emphasizes hygiene has gradually been understood by the broad masses. Now, we must not only make overall arrangements for production and pest elimination when agricultural production is not very busy, but also closely integrate it with production during the busy agricultural production season, so that pest elimination can be sustained. Some people think that during the busy farming season, labor is tight, and pest elimination should not be carried out, as it will affect production. This view of opposing pest elimination to production is wrong. It is indeed difficult to arrange health campaigns during the busy production season, but we can make reasonable arrangements. During the busiest times, we should focus on several necessary health tasks that can be combined with production, and arrange other tasks outside of the busiest times. Being busy with production and having tight labor does not mean that we can relax our health work, because only by ensuring the health of the labor force, so that they have sufficient energy and strong bodies, can they better complete production tasks. It is wrong to stop health work because of being busy. When the Liu Jintao Pioneer Group of the Hunan Provincial Institute of Parasitic Diseases carried out the prevention and treatment of hookworm disease in Huangshayu People's Commune, Yueyang County, it was precisely when the commune was undergoing rectification and water conservancy construction was in full swing. However, because they adhered to the principle of the Party Secretary taking the lead, fully utilized the strength of the masses, and closely integrated with production, they created the miracle of treating more than 10,000 hookworm patients in three days with three people, achieving high efficiency. At the same time as setting off a high tide of production, they quickly set off a high tide of treating hookworm disease.
    Spring is a busy season for agricultural labor and also a favorable time for pest elimination. We must launch several health blitzes at this decisive moment, combine them with fertilizer accumulation, focus on manure management, and treat mosquito and fly breeding grounds to eliminate the first generation of mosquitoes and flies before they emerge. In the north, before the trees sprout, we can seize the opportunity to carry out a rat extermination campaign before spring plowing. In areas where schistosomiasis, hookworm disease, and filariasis are prevalent, it is not only necessary to consolidate the results of snail elimination and manure management, but also to take measures as soon as possible to strengthen personal protection to avoid re-infection during spring plowing. In terms of disease treatment, in accordance with the principle of concentrated treatment during farming breaks, batch treatment during less busy times, and phased treatment during busy times, make labor arrangements and ensure the health of the labor force. Health personnel should go deep into the fields, canteens, and other collective welfare undertakings to understand the labor situation, living conditions, and disease conditions. Under the unified leadership of the local Party committee, vigorously launch mass movements, promptly supervise and inspect, and do a good job in disease prevention and elimination. While launching spring plowing and production, vigorously launch health campaigns and fight the first battle well on the front of pest elimination.

### 打好春季第一仗

    打好春季第一仗
    除害灭病是促进生产的一项重要措施，它为国家保护了最宝贵的财富——劳动力，从而为高速度发展生产创造了良好条件。广西玉林县山心人民公社，把卫生工作和生产紧紧结合起来，在加强粪便管理的同时，实行计划用肥，不但达到无害的要求，而且提高了肥效。贵州省凯里县，由于抗虐工作搞得好，有力地保证了生产，1958年全县粮食比1957年增长108％，去年又比1958年增长181．6％。福建省建宁县均口人民公社，一年多来治好了六千三百多个丝虫病患者，使全社增加了三十九万七千多个劳动日。这些生动的事实告诉我们，只要坚持以生产为中心，从生产出发开展卫生运动，卫生和生产两者是可以相互促进的，生产的发展带动了卫生事业的发展，卫生事业的发展反过来又是保证顺利进行生产的必要条件之一。两者是辩证统一的关系。
    卫生为生产，生产讲卫生的道理，已经逐渐被广大群众所了解。现在我们不仅在农业生产不很忙的时候，生产和除害灭病工作要统筹安排，在农业生产大忙的时候，也要紧密结合生产，使除害灭病工作能坚持下来。有人认为：农忙期间，劳动力紧张，不应该开展除害灭病工作，开展除害灭病工作就会影响生产。这种把除害灭病与生产对立起来的看法是错误的。生产忙的时候，安排卫生运动是有一定困难的，我们可以合理安排，在大忙时，着重进行几项必要的和可以结合生产进行的卫生工作，其他工作安排在大忙以外的时间进行。生产忙、劳动力紧张，并不能放松卫生工作，因为只有保证了劳动大军的健康，使他们有充沛的精神和强壮的身体才能更好的完成生产任务，因为忙而停止进行卫生工作是不对的。湖南省寄生虫病研究所刘锦桃先锋小组，在岳阳县黄沙于人民公社开展防治钩虫病工作时，正是整社和兴修水利等工作紧张的时候，但由于他们坚持了书记挂帅，充分运用群众力量，紧密结合生产，因而创造了三人三天治疗一万多钩虫病人的高工效奇迹。并且在掀起生产高潮的同时，迅速地又掀起了治疗钩虫病的高潮。
    春季是农业劳动的繁忙季节，也是除害灭病的有利时候。我们必须在这有决定性的时刻，开展几次卫生突击运动，结合积肥，大抓粪便管理，处理蚊蝇孳生地，把第一代蚊蝇消灭在露头之前。北方树叶还未发芽，在春耕前，还可抓紧时机搞一次灭鼠运动。在血吸虫病、钩虫病和丝虫病流行的地区，不仅需要巩固灭螺和粪便管理的成果，并应及早采取措施，加强个人防护，免得春耕时重新感染，在治疗疾病方面，根据农忙间歇突击治，小忙整批治，大忙分批治的原则，作好劳动安排，保证劳力的健康。卫生人员要深入田间、食堂和其他集体福利事业，了解劳动情况，生活情况，疾病情况，在当地党委的统一领导下，大搞群众运动，及时督促检查，做好除害灭病工作。在掀起春耕生产期间，大力展开卫生运动，在除害灭病的战线上，打好春季的第一仗。
