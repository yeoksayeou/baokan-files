    The People of Latin America Will Surely Triumph
    Zhao Feng
    In 1956, I and our outstanding Peking Opera artists visited Chile, Uruguay, Brazil, and Argentina. Many comrades asked me about the situation in Latin America. To describe all that I saw in these beautiful countries at once—the extraordinarily blue ocean of Rio de Janeiro, the modern architecture of Sao Paulo, the plazas and parks of Buenos Aires, the snow-capped Andes of Santiago, the palm trees on the silver shore of Montevideo…—it’s hard to tell it all at once. If people ask me what impressed us most during our visit, then I will not hesitate to say: what gave us the deepest impression were the people of Latin America, those enthusiastic and bold people we met who held infinite goodwill towards China.
    The people of Latin America hold high respect for China's long and ancient culture and cherish infinite longing for China, not only because China had Confucius and Li Bai (which they often mentioned), but more importantly, they thought of or saw their own path from the Chinese people's struggle in the revolution and the construction work after the victory of the revolution. An artist was so moved to tears when he saw some of the handicrafts we brought because he was worried about the decline of folk art in his own country. A university student inquired about how college graduates in our country are assigned jobs by the state because he was most concerned that he would soon graduate from university and still not be able to find a job... All kinds of people are thinking about such questions: "China's situation used to be similar to that of our country, but now China has found its own way, so what is our way out?" Real life makes many people consider similar questions. I think this is the fundamental reason why the people of Latin America have infinite goodwill towards the people of our country.
    We often hear Chileans talk about their copper and nitrate, Uruguayans talk about their beef and wool, Brazilians talk about their coffee and oil... More and more ordinary people are also beginning to consider this question: "Why has our abundance of resources turned into the cause of our poverty?" Therefore, when more people know that the Americans are manipulating the international prices of copper and coffee, when more people know that free trade with the countries of the socialist camp will be beneficial to their national economy and the people's livelihood, then it is not surprising that an ordinary taxi driver points to the American Embassy building and says, "This is a den of thieves," and that a member of parliament declares at a banquet that he never drinks American "Coca-Cola" soda out of patriotic sentiments. More and more Latin American people know that the US imperialists are enemies of the people of the world, and the first to bear the brunt of their economic aggression are the people of Latin American countries.
    Today, the Cuban people have stood up. The US imperialists see that the awakened Cuban people will provide an example for the people of all Latin American countries, which is why the US imperialists treat the Cuban people so viciously. But we know that for over a hundred years, the people of Latin America have regarded their national independence struggle as the glory of their people. The names of the heroes in the national independence struggles against the Spanish and Portuguese colonialists—Bolivar, San Martin, O'Higgins, Artigas—are still spoken by the Latin American people with infinite respect. The freedom-loving people of Latin America will surely cut off the shackles that the US imperialists have tied to their hands and feet!
    Thousands of miles of ocean cannot separate the friendship between the Chinese and Latin American people. The most fundamental reason is that we Chinese people clearly remember the taste of the disasters that the imperialists imposed on us in the past. Moreover, even today, our territory—Taiwan—is still occupied by US imperialism, and the United States has recently carried out provocations in the Taiwan Strait. Supporting the Cuban people's revolutionary struggle is also supporting the national and democratic struggles of the Latin American people. The Cuban people's struggle is by no means isolated, and the Cuban people's struggle will surely be victorious! This is the course of history. US imperialism cannot turn back the wheels of history!

    拉丁美洲人民必将胜利
    赵沨
    我和我国的杰出的京剧艺术家们在1956年访问过智利、乌拉圭、巴西和阿根廷。许多同志向我问起拉丁美洲的情况。要一下子说出我对这些美丽的国家所见的一切——里约热内卢的蓝得出奇的海洋，圣保罗的现代化的建筑，布宜诺斯艾利斯的广场和公园，圣地亚哥的白雪皑皑的安达斯山，蒙得维的亚的银河岸上的棕榈……，这是很难一下子讲得完的。人们如果问我，甚么是我们访问中印象最深刻的事物，那我则将毫不犹豫地说：给我们最深刻的印象的还是拉丁美洲的人民，那些我们遇到的对中国怀着无限好意的热情豪迈的人民。
    拉丁美洲的人们对中国的悠久而古老的文化怀着崇高的敬意，对中国怀着无限向往之情，还不仅是因为中国有过孔子和李白（这是他们常常提到的），更重要的是，他们从中国人民在革命的斗争中和在革命胜利以后的建设工作中想到了或者看到了他们自己的道路。一个艺术家看到我们带去的一些工艺品而激动得流泪，因为他在耽心自己国家的民间艺术的衰落。一个大学生询问我国大学生毕业后如何由国家分配工作，因为他最关心的是他很快要大学毕业了而还找不到职位……各种各样的人们都在想这样的问题：“中国过去和我们国家情况差不多，而现在中国已经找到了自己的道路，而我们的出路是怎样的呢？”现实生活使许多人都考虑类似的问题。我看这就是拉丁美洲人民对我国人民怀着无限好意的根本原因。
    我们常常听到智利人谈到他们的铜和硝，乌拉圭人谈到他们的牛肉和羊毛，巴西人谈到他们的咖啡和石油……越来越多的普通人民也开始考虑这样的问题了：“为什么我们的富源反倒变成了我们贫困的原因？”所以，当更多的人知道是美国人操纵着铜和咖啡的国际价格，当更多的人知道他们如果能和社会主义阵营的国家自由贸易将会对他们的国计民生有所裨益的时候，那么，一个普通出租汽车的司机指着美国大使馆的房子说：“这是贼窝”，一个议员在宴会上声明他基于爱国的情感而从不喝美国的“可口可乐”汽水……这自然也就不足为奇了。越来越多的拉丁美洲人民知道，美帝国主义者与世界人民为敌，而在经济侵略上，首当其冲的却正是拉丁美洲各国的人民。
    今天，古巴人民站起来了。美帝国主义者看到了觉醒的古巴人民将为整个拉丁美洲各国人民提供了范例，这就是美帝国主义为什么如此穷凶极恶地对待古巴人民的原因。但我们知道，百余年来，拉丁美洲人民把他们的民族独立斗争看作是他们人民的光荣，在反对西班牙、葡萄牙殖民者的民族独立斗争中的英雄们——玻利伐尔、圣·马丁、奥赫丁斯、阿尔特卡斯——的名字，拉丁美洲人民讲起他们的故事时仍然怀着无限崇敬之情。爱好自由的拉丁美洲的人民必将会斩断美帝国主义者束缚住他们手足的枷锁！
    万里重洋，隔不断中国和拉丁美洲人民之间的友谊，最根本的原因是，我们中国人民清楚地记得帝国主义者在过去强加在我们头上的灾难的滋味，而且，直到今天，我们的国土——台湾还被美帝国主义霸占，美国最近还在台湾海峡进行挑衅。支持古巴人民的革命斗争，也就是支持拉丁美洲人民的民族、民主斗争。古巴人民的斗争决不是孤立的，古巴人民的斗争，一定获得胜利！这是历史的进程。美帝国主义是无法使历史的车轮后退的！
