Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 23rd: People from all walks of life in Cuba held a rally last night in the auditorium of the University of Havana to support the people of Nicaragua in their struggle against the pro-imperialist tyranny of Somoza. This was the third day of the Week of Solidarity with the People of Latin America.

The portrait of Augusto César Sandino, the Nicaraguan national hero who led guerrillas in bloody battles against the American occupation forces, hung in the center of the auditorium. When a speaker quoted Sandino's famous saying, "The sovereignty of the people is not defended by negotiation, but by weapons in hand," a roar of cheers erupted from the workers, students, and militiamen present.

Maria Luisa Laffitte, a member of the Executive Committee of the Cuban Citizens' Committee for Support of the Liberation of Nicaragua, condemned the Somoza regime as a tyranny of running dogs subservient to the dollar.

Francisco Frisiolan, a Nicaraguan student leader exiled in Cuba, said that the slogan of our people is "To defend Latin American sovereignty to the death."

Gerardo Figueras, a member of the National Executive Committee of the "July 26th Movement," condemned the oppression of the peoples of Latin America by international financial oligarchs and monopoly groups. He said that our common enemy is American imperialism. He praised the example of Sandino and Castro's guerrillas. He said that this example shows the peoples of Latin America that their own reactionary armies and foreign occupation forces can be defeated. Latin America will take this path to achieve independence and democratic freedom.

Armando Amador, a Nicaraguan exile representing the Nicaraguan United Front, emphasized that the Nicaraguan people are engaged in a heroic struggle against American imperialism.

He said that Nicaragua needs a revolution like Cuba. There, the poor people listened to Castro's radio speeches until dawn. Cuban revolutionary songs are today the marching songs of combat in Nicaragua, and the people sing these songs in the streets against Somoza's tyrannical rule.

Angel Quevedo, Secretary-General of the Cuban University Students Federation, expressed at the meeting that the entire Cuban people support the fraternal people in their struggle for freedom and independence.

On the rostrum of the meeting were delegations from various Latin American countries, including delegations from Venezuela and Colombia, who had just arrived yesterday.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 23rd: Some Latin American trade union leaders who are in Havana to participate in the Week of Solidarity with the People of Latin America today called on all Latin American workers to mobilize against any foreign aggression against Cuba.

The leaders are Vicente Lombardo Toledano, President of the Latin American Labor Confederation, Honorio Villasis, leader of the Ecuadorian Workers' Confederation, and Orlando Carriel Villasón, leader of the Bolivian Workers' Central Union Federation.

They proposed holding a meeting of trade union leaders from various Latin American countries in order to prepare the conditions for making this year's "May Day" a massive action of the entire Latin American continent in support of the Cuban Revolution.

According to Toledano, the meeting will study organizing a movement to mobilize the Latin American working class against the slanderous propaganda campaign against Cuba by American imperialism.

Villasis said that in Ecuador, the central slogan for May 1st will be to defend the Cuban Revolution.

Carriel Villasón said that if Cuba is subjected to foreign aggression, the workers and peasants of Bolivia are prepared to go to Cuba to join the battle.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 23rd: The Cuban "Revolución" newspaper revealed today that while stepping up preparations for an invasion of Cuba, the United States is also instigating Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, and other countries to intensify their anti-Cuban conspiracies in Central America under the pretext of "anti-communism."

The newspaper reported that Cuban war criminal Emilio Núñez Portuondo is traveling to various countries in Central America after meeting with figures in Washington in order to launch a so-called "anti-communist" movement. The newspaper pointed out that the Guatemalan government is conspiring with Cuba's enemies to carry out an invasion of Cuba.

"Revolución" said that from March 24th to 27th, representatives of the Central American anti-communist conference will hold a meeting in Managua, the capital of Nicaragua. Leading this meeting is the United Fruit Company of the United States. Nicaraguan dictator Somoza and Cuban war criminals Masferrer, Ventura, Portuondo, and others will participate in this conference. "Revolución" emphasized that these facts clearly demonstrate the development of the anti-Cuban conspiracy in Central America. The people of all countries must be vigilant about this.

    据新华社哈瓦那23日电　古巴各界人士昨天晚上在哈瓦那大学的大礼堂里举行了支持尼加拉瓜人民反对索摩查亲帝暴政的大会。这是支援拉丁美洲人民周的第三天活动。
    曾经领导游击队同美国占领军血战的尼加拉瓜民族英雄桑地诺的肖像挂在礼堂正中。当一位演讲者援引桑地诺的一句名言——“人民的主权不是靠谈判，而是要靠手里的武器来保卫”时，在到会的工人、学生和民兵中爆发了一片欢呼声。
    古巴公民支援尼加拉瓜解放委员会执行委员会委员玛丽亚·路易莎·拉菲塔谴责索摩查政权是听命于美元的走狗的暴政。
    流亡在古巴的尼加拉瓜学生领导人弗朗西斯科·弗里西奥内说，我们各国人民的口号是“誓死保卫拉丁美洲的主权”。
    “7月26日运动”全国执行委员会委员赫拉尔多·菲格雷斯谴责国际财政寡头和垄断集团对拉丁美洲各国人民的压迫。他说，我们的共同的敌人是美帝国主义。他盛赞桑地诺和卡斯特罗游击队员的范例。他说，这一范例向拉丁美洲人民表明，本国的反动军队和外国占领军是可以被击败的。拉丁美洲将沿着这条道路取得独立和民主自由。
    尼加拉瓜流亡人士阿曼多·阿马多尔代表尼加拉瓜联合阵线强调指出，尼加拉瓜人民正在进行英勇的斗争来反对美帝国主义。
    他说，尼加拉瓜需要像古巴一样的革命。在那儿，贫苦的人民倾听着卡斯特罗的广播演说直到清晨。古巴的革命歌曲在今天的尼加拉瓜是战斗的进行曲，人民在大街上唱着这些歌曲反对索摩查暴政统治。
    古巴大学生联合会总书记安赫耳·克维多在大会上表示全体古巴人民支持争取自由和独立的兄弟人民。
    大会主席台上有来自拉丁美洲各国的代表团，其中委内瑞拉和哥伦比亚的代表团是昨天刚刚到达的。

    这家报纸报道，古巴战犯埃米略·努涅斯·波尔图翁多在会见了华盛顿的人物之后，正在中美各国奔走，以便展开一个所谓“反共”的运动。报纸指出，危地马拉政府正在同古巴的敌人一起策划对古巴的侵略。
    “革命报”说，在3月24日到27日，中美反共会议的代表将在尼加拉瓜的首都马那瓜举行会议。领导这次会议的是美国联合果品公司。尼加拉瓜独裁者索摩查和古巴战犯马斯费雷尔、本图拉、波尔图翁多等人将参加这次大会。“革命报”强调指出，这些事实清楚地表明了在中美的反古巴阴谋的发展情况。各国人民对此必须警惕。
