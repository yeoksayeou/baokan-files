Grafting old mulberry trees yields more leaves
Old farmer Qiu A’long of the Xinghuo Production Team in Linghu Commune, Wuxing County, Zhejiang Province, used grafting methods to rejuvenate old mulberry trees, resulting in a doubling of mulberry leaf production. According to investigations, the total branch length of grafted mulberry trees more than ten years old was 32% greater than that of ungrafted trees after two years. The scions for grafting old mulberry trees should be stored buried in mud before grafting, and the grafting time should be around "Qingming".

    嫁接老桑产叶多
    浙江吴兴县菱湖公社星火生产队老农丘阿龙用嫁接办法更新老桑树，使桑叶产量成倍增加。经调查，十年以上的桑树嫁接二年后比不嫁接的总条长32％。嫁接老桑的接穗要在嫁接前埋在泥里贮藏，嫁接时间以“清明”前后为宜。
