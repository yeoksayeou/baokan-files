Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 26th: According to the "Akahata" newspaper today, Japanese Communist Party member Iwama Masao revealed at the Senate Budget Committee meeting on the 25th that the Kishi Nobusuke government, based on the "Basic Labor Contract" it signed with the U.S. military stationed in Japan, hired former Japanese soldiers for the U.S. military to collect information about China and the Soviet Union.

Iwama pointed out that, according to this "Basic Labor Contract" signed in 1957, the U.S. military hired personnel such as bacteriological consultants and military intelligence consultants. The contract stipulated that, in order to meet the requirements of the U.S. Far East Air Force and various Air Force Commands, the hired personnel must maintain regular contact with Japanese official and private institutions and individuals, research and collect intelligence on the Northeast region of China, as well as the military, economic, and political situation of a specific area within this region, and conduct judgment and research.

Iwama pointed out that this is clearly a contract assisting the U.S. military in espionage activities. He revealed that the U.S. military authorities hired many former Japanese soldiers with fifteen to twenty years of military intelligence experience under this contract.

Iwama pointed out that this contract was retained even after the signing of the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." Iwama strongly condemned this contract as a violation of the Japanese Constitution and pointed out that this proves that the Kishi Nobusuke government's propaganda that the new "Security Treaty" is not a military alliance and does not antagonize China and the Soviet Union is a complete lie to deceive the Japanese people.

    岸信介政府充当侵略帮凶
    为美国搜集中苏情报
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：据“赤旗报”今天报道，日本共产党议员岩间正男25日在参议院预算委员会会议上揭露，岸信介政府根据它同驻日美军签订的“劳务基本合同”替美军雇用日本旧军人，搜集有关中国和苏联的情报。
    岩间指出，根据这项在1957年签订的“劳务基本合同”，美军雇用了细菌学顾问和军事情报顾问等人员。合同规定，为了适应美国远东空军和各地空军司令部的要求，雇用人员必须经常同日本官方和民间机构以及个人保持联系，研究和搜集有关中国的东北地区的情报，以及这一地区内某一特定区域的军事、经济和政治情况，并且进行判断和研究。
    岩间指出，这显然是协助美军从事间谍工作的合同。他揭露，美军当局根据这项合同雇用了许多有着十五年到二十年军事情报工作经验的日本旧军人。
    岩间指出，这项合同在新日美“安全条约”签订后，仍然保留下来。岩间强烈谴责这项合同违反日本宪法，并且指出，这证明岸信介散布的新“安全条约”不是军事同盟和并不敌视中苏等宣传，完全是欺骗日本人民的谎话。
