Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 11th: The "Hai Huang" ship, sent by the Chinese government to transport overseas Chinese who suffered in the anti-Chinese movement in Indonesia, entered Tanjung Priok Port here today. This is the second time this ship has come here to transport overseas Chinese back to China. In addition, the two ships "Da Bao Kang" and "Fu An", which are also transporting overseas Chinese, will arrive here tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, respectively.

Yesterday and today, more than 800 affected overseas Chinese from Cimahe, Karawang and three other places in West Java went to Jakarta to gather and wait for ships to return to China. Now a total of more than 1,800 overseas Chinese have arrived in Jakarta for assembly. At the same time, 667 overseas Chinese in Surabaya, East Java, have already set sail for China on the "Da Bao An" ship. The "Da Bao An" will go directly to Huangpu.

These overseas Chinese purchased their own tickets or received help from local compatriots. Among them, 395 are poor overseas Chinese workers and their families, and 232 are students. Some of them are white-haired elderly people who came to Indonesia since childhood. These poor overseas Chinese are extremely happy to have the opportunity to return to their motherland.

    接运华侨回国的“海皇号”轮船
    十一日再次到达雅加达
    新华社雅加达11日电　中国政府派来接运在印度尼西亚排华反华运动中受害的华侨的“海皇号”轮船今天进入这里的丹绒不碌港。这是这艘轮船第二次来这里接运华侨回国。另外两艘接运华侨的轮船“大宝康”号和“福安”号也将分别在明天和后天到达这里。
    昨天和今天又有八百多名受害华侨从西爪哇的芝马墟和加拉横等三个地方到雅加达集中候船回国。现在共有一千八百多名华侨到达雅加达集中。同时，东爪哇泗水的六百六十七名华侨已经乘“大宝安”号轮船启程回国，“大宝安”将直接驶往黄埔。
    这些华侨自购船票或得到当地同胞的帮助。他们当中有三百九十五人是穷苦的华侨工人和他们的家属，二百三十二人是学生。他们之中有些是从小就到印度尼西亚来的白发老人。这些穷苦华侨对有机会回返祖国感到极其高兴。
