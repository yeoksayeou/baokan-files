Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 4th: The National Conference to Prevent Revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" held a meeting of its executive committee today and decided on a plan to launch a series of escalating nationwide unified actions.

The plan stipulates that the 13th unified action will be held on March 19th, the 14th unified action from April 1st to 7th, and the 15th unified action from April 15th to 21st.

The plan states that on March 19th, the day of the 13th unified action, mass rallies and demonstrations on the scale of "May Day" International Labor Day will be held in various parts of the country, organized by prefecture. On this day, each prefecture will also send approximately 5,000 representatives to participate in the central rally of more than 20,000 people in Tokyo.

The plan states that the 14th unified action, starting on April 1st, will be carried out in conjunction with the Japanese workers' spring struggle. Government and public employees' union members will hold workplace rallies during work hours, while other industrial workers will hold timed strikes, and protest rallies will be held in various locations.

On April 4th and 5th, a national conference will be held, centered on the Anti-Base League, with the participation of workers, farmers, fishermen, and citizens living around military bases, to prevent the revision of the "Security Treaty" and demand the removal of military bases.

The plan stipulates that during the 15th unified action, a protest rally of 100,000 people will be held in Tokyo, and a demonstration will be held towards the Diet.

The plan points out that because the Diet's deliberation of the new "Security Treaty" will enter an important stage at that time, the largest-scale unified action should be launched in conjunction with the workers' struggle to demand higher wages. Private enterprise unions will hold a 24-hour strike, and government and public employees' unions will hold two-hour workplace rallies during work hours.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 5th: The action program for the spring struggle adopted today by the expanded meeting of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) states that this year's spring struggle will be the largest-scale spring struggle ever launched by "Sohyo."

According to this program, the Federation of Synthetic Chemical Industry Workers' Unions, the Japan Coal Miners' Union, the Dockworkers' Union, the Chemical Industry Unions Alliance, the All Japan Shipbuilding Workers' Union, the All Japan Metal Workers' Union, the Japan Iron and Steel Industry Workers' Unions Federation, government and public employees' unions, and the Japan Private Railway Workers' Union Federation will hold strikes and rallies from the end of March to April, pushing the spring struggle to a climax.

The Council meeting also made decisions on actions to be taken during the anti-fascist law demonstration scheduled for March 10th and the 13th nationwide unified action to be launched on the 19th, and discussed the participation of various unions in the 14th and 15th nationwide unified actions against the new "Security Treaty." "Sohyo"-affiliated unions will hold strikes, workplace rallies, and mass rallies during these unified actions.

The Council meeting also stipulated that the ten days from March 21st to 31st will be Labor Rights Protection Week. During this period, seminars will be held and publicity campaigns will be launched to demand the establishment of basic labor rights and the ratification of International Labor Organization conventions. From April 1st to 15th, "Sohyo"-affiliated workers will launch publicity campaigns among non-unionized workers, ordinary citizens, and farmers, calling on them to participate in the struggle against the Diet's ratification of the new "Security Treaty," demanding higher wages, establishing a minimum wage system, and shortening working hours.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 4th: Yasui Kaoru, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, said today that Kishi Nobusuke, who is stepping up the revival of Japanese militarism, is a common enemy of the people of China and Japan. The Japanese people must not harbor illusions that Sino-Japanese relations can improve under Kishi Nobusuke's administration.

Yasui Kaoru made these remarks when he briefed Ota Kaoru, Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, on his recent visit to China.

Yasui Kaoru also emphasized that it is estimated that the Japanese reactionaries will further intensify their sabotage and disruption of the Japanese peace movement and the Sino-Japanese friendship movement in the future, and the Japanese people must strengthen their unity.

Ota Kaoru expressed his full agreement with Yasui Kaoru's views and stated that he is willing to continue consultations with Yasui Kaoru in order to jointly launch the struggle against the Diet's ratification of the new "Security Treaty."

    日本阻止修改日美条约国民会议
    决定连续展开全国统一行动
    安井郁说岸信介是日中两国人民的共同敌人
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：阻止修改日美“安全条约”国民会议今天举行干事会会议，决定了在今后展开一浪高一浪的全国统一行动的计划。
    计划规定在3月19日举行第十三次统一行动，从4月1日到7日举行第十四次统一行动，从4月15日到21日举行第十五次统一行动。
    计划说，在3月19日展开第十三次统一行动当天，要在全国各地以县为单位举行类似“五一”国际劳动节规模的群众集会和示威游行。这一天，各县还要派出代表约五千人参加东京的两万多人的中央大会。
    计划说，从4月1日开始的第十四次统一行动，将同日本工人的春季斗争结合起来进行。政府职员工会会员将在工作时间内举行工作场所大会，其他产业工会将举行定时罢工，同时在各地举行抗议集会。
    在4月4日和5日两天，要以反对基地联盟为中心，举行由军事基地周围的工人、农民、渔民、市民参加的阻止修改“安全条约”、要求撤除军事基地的全国大会。
    计划规定在展开第十五次统一行动时，东京将举行十万人的抗议大会，并且向国会举行示威游行。
    计划指出，因为那时国会审议新“安全条约”的工作将进入重要阶段，所以要结合工人要求提高工资的斗争，展开最大规模的统一行动，私营企业工会要举行二十四小时罢工，政府职员工会要在工作时间内举行两小时的工作场所大会。
    新华社5日讯　东京消息：日本工会总评议会理事会扩大会议今天通过的春季斗争行动纲领指出，今年的春季斗争将是迄今为止“总评”所展开的规模最大的一次春季斗争。
    根据这个纲领，合成化学产业工会联合会、日本煤矿工会、码头工人工会、化学产业工会同盟、全日本造船工会、全日本金属工会、日本钢铁产业工会联合会、政府职员工会和日本私营铁道工会总联合会等将从3月底到4月期间举行罢工和集会等活动，把春季斗争推向高潮。
    理事会会议还就预定在3月10日举行反对法西斯法律示威游行和19日展开第十三次全国统一行动时采取的行动作出了决定，并且讨论了各工会参加第十四次和第十五次反对新“安全条约”的全国统一行动的问题。“总评”所属工会将在这些统一行动中举行罢工、召开工作场所大会和群众大会。
    理事会会议还规定从3月21日到31日的十天为保卫劳工权利旬。在这期间，将举行讨论会和展开宣传运动，要求确立基本的劳工权利和批准国际劳工组织公约。从4月1日到15日期间，“总评”所属工人将在未加入工会的工人、普通市民和农民中间展开宣传活动，号召他们参加反对国会批准新“安全条约”、要求提高工资、建立最低工资制和缩短工作时间的斗争。
    新华社4日讯　东京消息：日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁今天说，正在加紧复活日本军国主义的岸信介是日中两国人民的共同敌人，日本人民千万不能幻想在岸信介当政的情况下可以使日中关系好转。
    安井郁是在向日本工会总评议会议长太田熏介绍他不久前访问中国的情况时说这番话的。
    安井郁还强调指出，估计日本反动势力今后对日本和平运动和日中友好运动的破坏和捣乱会进一步加剧，日本人民必须加强团结。
    太田熏表示完全同意安井郁的意见，并且表示为了共同展开反对国会批准新“安全条约”的斗争，愿意同安井郁继续协商。
