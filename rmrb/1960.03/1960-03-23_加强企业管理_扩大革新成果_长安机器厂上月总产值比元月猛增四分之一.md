Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, March 22nd: The Chongqing Chang'an Machine Factory, in the midst of the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, has strengthened its enterprise management in a timely and comprehensive manner, giving full play to the effects of technical innovation and promoting the continuous improvement of production levels. In January and February, the factory completed its production plans nine and six days ahead of schedule, respectively. The total output value in February increased by 25.2% compared to January, and labor productivity increased by 31.3%. The factory completed its first quarter production plan ahead of schedule on March 16th.

In the first two months and ten days of this year, Chang'an Machine Factory saw the emergence of four single-machine automated and semi-automated workshops, one mechanized and semi-mechanized forging workshop, twenty-four linked production lines, nine hundred and ninety-nine automated and semi-automated single machines, and three thousand one hundred and one manual operations that have been mechanized and semi-mechanized. Factory workers have submitted more than 320,000 innovation proposals.

In order to give full play to the results of innovation in production and to consolidate and improve the movement, Chang'an Machine Factory has strengthened its technical management in a timely manner. In mid-February, the factory organized a thousand-person inspection team composed of engineering technicians and veteran workers with technical levels of seven or eight, led by the Party Committee Secretary, to go deep into the workshops to help summarize innovation experiences, gather the workers' individual experiences, improve them, and then incorporate them into the process regulations. Typical cutting specifications were formulated for similar machine tools and similar parts, and operating methods were unified. In just over ten days, the inspection team helped the workshops summarize hundreds of sets of experiences. In the process of summarizing experiences, the inspection team members, together with the workers who created the experiences, explained the principles and characteristics of the new experiences to the workers who were learning them on the spot. They used exhibitions, on-site meetings, and other methods to allow the creators to speak from personal experience, and then launched discussions among the workers to enrich and improve them; then they were formally incorporated into process regulations and cutting specifications. After the overhaul section of the motorized vehicle workshop inspected and identified the typical specifications for high-speed cutting of lathes, production efficiency generally increased by more than one time.

After the machine tools were automated and semi-automated, and the management of multiple machine tools was universally promoted, there was a need for fixtures for rapid loading and unloading of workpieces and long-life tools. The original process equipment was no longer fully applicable. At this time, the factory vigorously promoted high-efficiency new tools such as corn milling cutters, three-flute milling cutters, Qunli-style turning tools, non-chip breaking turning tools, and reciprocating planning tools; at the same time, it promoted the advanced experience of multi-tool, multi-blade, and multi-clamp operation to reduce adjustment man-hours and auxiliary man-hours. After model worker Chen Xingfu mastered the multi-carding technology, he could card one hundred and twenty pieces at a time, increasing work efficiency by more than twenty times, greatly leveraging the efficiency of automated and semi-automated equipment. The factory has also done a lot of work in improving product process design and the standardization and specification of parts.

In order to make single-machine automation adaptable to multi-variety production and multi-machine tool management, the factory adopted the method of product classification and process alignment, classifying and aligning parts according to their shape, size, accuracy, and processing method, and adjusting similar parts to the same section and group. The former vehicle group of the tool workshop had only two machine tools implementing multi-machine tool management. After product classification and process alignment, ten machine tools have now realized multi-machine tool management, saving twenty-one labor forces. At present, two hundred and forty-six machine tools in the factory have realized multi-machine tool management, which can save four hundred and forty laborers.

In order to promptly reflect the creations of the masses of employees in the technical innovation movement in the work hour quotas, so that the work hour quotas maintain an average advanced level, Chang'an Machine Factory adopted the method of "one estimate, two set, three implement, four revise," that is: first, the masses estimate the initial quota based on their own production level, and secondly, analyze and compare according to technical accounting or actual statistical data, revise and approve the quota; then issue the quota to the masses for implementation; finally, after the test of production practice, absorb advanced factors to revise the quota again, so that the quota has sufficient advancement and a broad mass base.

In addition, the factory also re-divided groups according to machine tool type, product object, and automatic production line to meet the new requirements after many workshops and groups have production automation lines and implement multi-machine tool management.

    加强企业管理　扩大革新成果
    长安机器厂上月总产值比元月猛增四分之一
    据新华社重庆22日电　重庆长安机器厂在技术革新和技术革命运动中，及时全面地加强企业管理，充分发挥技术革新的效果，促使生产水平不断提高。1、2月份，这个厂分别提前九天和六天完成了生产计划。2月份的总产值比1月份增长25．2％，劳动生产率提高31．3％。全厂第一季度生产计划在3月16日便提前完成了。
    长安机器厂在今年头两个月零十天里出现了四个单机自动化和半自动化的车间，一个机械化和半机械化的锻工车间，二十四条联动生产线，九百九十九台自动化和半自动化单机，有三千一百零一个手工操作项目实现了机械化和半机械化，全厂职工提出的革新建议达三十二万多件。
    为使革新成果充分在生产中发挥作用，并使运动得到巩固和提高，长安机器厂及时加强了技术管理。2月中旬，厂里组织了有工程技术人员和具有七、八级技术水平的老工人参加的千人检查团，由党委书记挂帅，深入各车间帮助总结革新经验，把工人的点滴经验集中起来加以提高，然后纳入工艺规程，并按同类机床、同类零件制定出典型切削规范，统一操作方法。在短短的十多天内，检查团就帮助各事间总结了成百套经验。在总结经验的过程中，检查团成员同创造经验的工人一起，就地向学习这些经验的工人讲解新经验的原理和特点，采用展览会、现场会等方式由创造者现身说法，并在工人中展开讨论，加以充实和完善；然后正式纳入工艺规程与切削规范。机动车间大修工段通过检查鉴定，制定和贯彻了车床高速切削典型规范以后，生产效率普遍提高一倍以上。
    机床实现自动化和半自动化，普遍推行了多机床管理以后，需要有快速装卸工件的夹具和寿命长的刀具，原配备的工艺装置已不完全适用。这时，厂里便大力推广玉米铣刀、三刃铣刀、群力式车刀、无断屑槽车刀、来回刨刀等高效率的新刀具；同时推行多刀多刃多夹活的先进经验，减少调整工时和辅助工时。标兵陈兴富掌握了多卡活的技术以后，一次卡一百二十件活，提高工效二十多倍，大大发挥了自动化、半自动化设备的效能。在改进产品工艺设计和零件的标准化和规格化方面，厂里也作了不少工作。
    为了使单机自动化后能适应多品种生产和多机床管理，这个厂采取了产品归类、工艺对口的办法，依零件形状、尺寸、精度和加工方法进行分类归口，把同类型的零件调整到同一工段、小组。工具车间元车组原来只有两台机床实行多机床管理，在产品归类、工艺对口以后，已有十台机床实现了多机床管理，节约出了二十一个劳动力。目前全厂已有二百四十六台机床实现多机床管理，可节约劳动力四百四十人。
    为了把职工群众在技术革新运动中的创造及时体现在工时定额中，使工时定额保持平均先进水平，长安机器厂采取了一估、二定、三贯、四修的办法，即：首先由群众根据自己达到的生产水平估出初步定额，其次根据技术核算或实际统计资料进行分析比较，修正后经批准订出定额；然后把定额下达群众贯彻执行；最后，经过生产实践的考验，吸收先进因素对定额再进行修订，使定额具有充分的先进性和广泛的群众基础。
    另外，这个厂还按机床类型、产品对象和自动生产线，重新划分小组，以适应许多车间和小组出现生产自动线和实行多机床管理以后的新要求。
