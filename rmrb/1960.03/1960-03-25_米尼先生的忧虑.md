Mr. Meany's Worries
　　
American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) President Meany admitted while testifying before the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee not long ago that millions of Americans do not have "freedom from want and fear," and that at least 20 million workers are "in chronic poverty, or in a situation worse than poverty." Meany could not help but worry about the "ideological competition" between the United States and socialist countries because of this. He said that the increase in the number of American "poor workers" undermines the "prestige" of the United States in other countries.
　　
Of course, Meany is not concerned with the interests of the American working class, but with the "prestige" of the American capitalist system, especially the future of America's "psychological warfare." When Nixon talked about "the great ideological battle the United States is waging with the communist world," he praised Meany: "No one in the United States opposes communism more forcefully, clearly, and effectively than he does." Meany himself did not hide the role he was playing. In a letter expressing "full support" for the U.S. "Mutual Security Program" last March, he stated, "Against the enemy of communist imperialism, we must use all our economic and political forces in all circles to fight it." However, now it seems that Meany's belief in "ideological warfare" is not as "powerful" as Nixon praised.
　　
Nixon once declared: "Let us see it as our mission in the world today to provide not only the ideal of freedom to all mankind, but also the fact of freedom." Please note, it is not only to provide the "ideal of freedom," but also to provide the "fact of freedom," not only to the "free world," but also to "all mankind"!
　　
What kind of "freedom" to provide? When Eisenhower visited Brazil recently, he asked underdeveloped countries to make this "choice": "Rather poverty in freedom than prosperity in slavery." Then he said a series of tempting words, if such a "choice" is made, then, "in the long run, freedom will also produce a highly productive economic system established by mankind," thereby "obtaining material things." In a word, originally, it was to have the people of economically underdeveloped countries "rejoice in their poverty." "Content" with the poverty caused by the plunder of hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars and other foreign capital, "happy" to choose the "path" of capitalist slavery arranged by the United States. Not only that, Eisenhower also said in his State of the Union Address that he wanted to "help" underdeveloped countries to "enthusiastically gather under the banner of freedom." How to "gather"? Taking Latin America as an example, the so-called "gathering" is to strengthen the "Pan-American system," as Eisenhower reiterated during his visit to South America. But in this system, there is only the freedom for the United States to control, enslave, and plunder Latin American countries, and no other freedom. The U.S. "Star Evening News" put it very clearly: "The Pan-American world is ultimately the world of the United States."
　　
In order to resist the enormous influence of the high-speed development of the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries, the American ruling group has always described the construction achievements made by the people after becoming masters of their own affairs as "prosperity in slavery," and described the capitalist kingdom of a small group of billionaires who plunder millions of people as the "free world," and wants the people of all countries not to oppose the exploitation and aggression of American imperialism. Dulles, before his death, viciously slandered the unprecedented achievements of our people's Great Leap Forward as being obtained at the cost of so-called "sacrifice of freedom," and wanted the people of those countries that have embarked on independence to "choose" the American-style "freedom." Although with such "freedom," one would be in poverty, Dulles said, it was worth it. Now, Eisenhower has even made a guarantee: Although the people of underdeveloped countries are in "poverty in freedom" today, one day they will be able to reach the level of the United States today and establish a "highly productive economic system"!
　　
However, in Nixon's words, this is, at most, only providing the "ideal," not the "fact." The fact is that the hundreds of millions of people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are fighting for and defending independence have long experienced what American imperialism "provides" them with, which is not "freedom," but disaster. In Latin America, there is such an idiom: "Poor Latin America, you are so far from God and so close to the United States!"
　　
Taking a step back, even if an "economic system with great productivity" like the United States is established, what will happen? The fact that Meany admitted is: the vast majority of people still cannot have "freedom from want and fear." Moreover, Meany also said that the "current situation" in the United States "cannot improve over time, it can only make the situation worse, much worse."
　　
It turns out that the path Eisenhower arranged for the people of economically underdeveloped countries is from "poverty in freedom" to "poverty in freedom," and the closer they get to the level of the United States, the more "much worse" it becomes! Therefore, it is not easy to make the "ideal of freedom" appealing to the people of these countries. Even American "Cold War" strategists, such as the "group of experts" from the Institute of International Affairs at Harvard University in the United States, could not help but admit in their report to the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee entitled "Ideology and Diplomacy" that "in many parts of the world, the so-called free enterprise, free, capitalist society that is associated with the United States does not have many believers."
　　
Reality is so ruthless, how can we blame Mr. Meany, who is loyal to the "cause of freedom," for worrying about the future of "ideological warfare"!

    米尼先生的忧虑
    洛丁
    美国劳联—产联主席米尼不久以前在参院劳工与公共福利委员会上作证时承认，千千万万美国人并没有“免于匮乏和恐惧的自由”，其中至少有二千万美国工人“处在长期的贫困之中，或者处在比贫困更为恶劣的状况之中”。米尼不禁由此对美国同社会主义国家进行“思想意识竞赛”感到担忧，他说，美国“贫苦工人”队伍的增加破坏了美国在其他国家中的“威望”。
    米尼当然不是从美国工人阶级的利益着眼，而是从美国资本主义制度的“威望”，特别是从美国的“心理战”的前途着眼的。尼克松在谈到“美国正在同共产主义世界展开一场巨大的思想战”时，曾这样称赞过米尼：“在美国没有一个人比他更有力、更明确、更有效地反对共产主义”。米尼自己也没有掩饰他扮演的是什么角色，他在去年3月发表“全力支持”美国“共同安全计划”的信中就表白说，“对共产帝国主义这个敌人，我们必须用各界的经济和政治方面的一切力量同它进行斗争”。不过，现在看来，米尼对“思想战”的信念，却不如尼克松所赞赏的那么“有力”。
    尼克松曾这样宣布：“让我们把向全人类不是仅仅提供自由的理想而是提供自由的事实看作是我们今天在世界上的使命”。请看，不仅要提供“自由的理想”，还要提供“自由的事实”，不单是向“自由世界”提供，而且是向“全人类”提供！
    提供什么样的“自由”呢？艾森豪威尔在最近访问巴西时，要求经济不发达国家应该作这样的“选择”：“宁可要自由中的贫困而不愿要奴役中的繁荣”。接着他说了一通诱惑人的话，如果作了这样的“选择”，那末，“从长期来说，自由也会产生人类所建立的生产力很大的经济制度”，从而“取得物质的东西”。一句话，原来是要经济不发达国家的人民“安贫乐道”。“安”于美国成百亿美元和其他外国资本的掠夺所造成的贫困，“乐”于选择美国所安排的资本奴役之“道”。不仅如此，艾森豪威尔在国情咨文中还说，要“帮助”不发达国家“热情地聚集在自由的旗帜下”。怎样“聚集”呢？以拉丁美洲为例，所谓“聚集”，就是像艾森豪威尔访问南美时所重申的那样，要加强“泛美体系”。可是在这个体系里，只有美国控制、奴役、掠夺拉丁美洲国家的自由，而没有别的自由。美国“明星晚报”说得很清楚，“泛美世界归根究底是美国的世界”。
    美国统治集团为了抵制苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家高速度发展的巨大影响，一直把人民作了主人后取得的建设成就说成是“奴役中的繁荣”，而把一小撮亿万富翁掠夺千百万人民的资本王国说成是“自由世界”，并且要各国人民不去反对美帝国主义的剥削和侵略。杜勒斯生前就曾特别恶毒地诬蔑我国人民大跃进所取得的史无前例的成就是以所谓“牺牲自由”的代价换取的，要那些走上独立的国家的人民“选择”美国式的“自由”。虽然有了这样的“自由”，就要处于贫困，但杜勒斯说，这是值得的。现在，艾森豪威尔更提出了保证：不发达国家的人民今天虽然是“自由中的贫困”，但有一天总能够达到像美国今天这样建立“生产力很大的经济制度”的！
    可是，用尼克松的话来说，这至多还只是提供了“理想”，而不是“事实”。事实是，正为争取和维护独立而斗争的亚非和拉丁美洲的亿万人民，对于美帝国主义“提供”给他们的究竟是什么东西，是早已领教过了，那不是“自由”，而是灾难。在拉丁美洲就有一句这样的成语：“可怜的拉丁美洲，你离上帝那么远而离美国却这么近！”
    退一步讲，即使建立了像美国那样的“生产力很大的经济制度”，又将怎样呢？米尼承认的事实是：广大人民依旧不能有“免于匮乏和恐惧的自由”。而且米尼还说，美国“目前的情况并不能随着时间的推移而好转，它只能使情况恶化，大大地恶化”。
    原来，艾森豪威尔给经济不发达国家人民安排的道路是，从“自由中的贫困”到“自由中的贫困”，而且越是到了美国的水平，就越是“大大地恶化”！因此，要使“自由的理想”在这些国家的人民中具有迷惑力，不是容易的事。连美国的“冷战”策士们，例如美国哈佛大学国际问题研究所的“一批专家”们，在他们替美国参院外委会起草的题为“意识形态和外交”的报告中，也不能不承认，“在世界许多部分同美国有联系的，所谓自由企业的、自由的、资本主义的社会并没有很多信徒”。
    现实是如此无情，又怎能怪忠于“自由事业”的米尼先生，要对“思想战”的前途感到忧虑呢！
