Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 16th March. After graduating from spare-time primary schools, 300,000 farmers in Jiangsu Province have entered spare-time secondary schools, bringing the province's rural spare-time education to a new stage.

To meet the needs of farmers who have graduated from spare-time primary schools, Jiangsu Province has established a large number of spare-time junior middle schools and spare-time junior technical schools to further improve the cultural level of the peasant masses. The spare-time junior middle school offers courses in politics, Chinese language, mathematics, physics and chemistry, and agricultural knowledge. The curriculum of the spare-time junior technical schools is determined by the local needs, generally with a greater emphasis on technical courses than on cultural courses.

The studies in the spare-time secondary schools are closely integrated with production and the study time is arranged according to the principle of "study every day during the slack season, study every other day during the slightly busy season, and study flexibly during the busy season, without interrupting learning." During the period when the days are long and the nights are short and production is busy, they study for two hours every evening. During the winter and spring when the days are short and the nights are long and production is slack, they study for three hours every evening. Throughout the year, apart from the summer and autumn harvest breaks and the Spring Festival holiday, the classroom study time is about 400 hours, ensuring that both production and study are not neglected.

The teachers of the spare-time secondary schools are mainly recruited locally, with those who are capable being teachers, relying on their own efforts, and gradually improving the quality of teachers. Generally, the secretary of the commune Party committee or the secretary of the brigade branch serves as the political teacher; the technicians of the commune agricultural science institute or technical extension station serve as the agricultural knowledge and technical teachers; and people with appropriate qualifications are selected from the masses to serve as cultural teachers. Some spare-time junior middle schools also hire primary school teachers, agricultural middle school teachers, and commune spare-time education instructors to teach part-time.

In order to train teachers for spare-time secondary schools, each county is currently running worker-peasant normal schools to prepare a certain number of full-time teachers for key spare-time middle schools in the future. Jiangyin, Rugao, Liyang and other counties have also established half-farming and half-study normal schools and spare-time normal schools. Many spare-time middle schools have also adopted the method of linking up with ordinary middle schools and agricultural middle schools to form teaching and research groups, using methods such as mutual class visits and regular teaching demonstrations to train and improve the teachers of spare-time middle schools.

Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, Jiangsu Province launched a vigorous anti-illiteracy campaign in 1958. The number of people who were made literate that year was equal to seven times the total number of people who were made literate in the past eight years. After the vast number of farmers got rid of illiteracy, a large number of spare-time primary schools were established in various places. After two years of study, some students in spare-time primary schools have reached the equivalent of upper primary school graduation level, and they are eager to further study cultural and scientific knowledge and learn technology. Therefore, after enrolling in spare-time junior middle schools and spare-time junior technical schools, the 300,000 farmers have generally shown a high degree of enthusiasm for learning, and their political awareness and cultural and technical levels have been further improved. Many students in spare-time junior middle schools and spare-time junior technical schools have large areas of high-yield experimental fields and have established scientific research groups and tool reform experimental groups, etc. They apply the knowledge they have learned to production, and many innovations and creations have quickly emerged.

At present, under the leadership of the commune Party committees, farmers' spare-time secondary schools are developing vigorously in Jiangsu Province, and more than 5,000 farmers in the province have entered spare-time senior high schools to study.

### 江苏农村业余教育事业跨进新阶段  三十万农民升入业余中学

    江苏农村业余教育事业跨进新阶段
    三十万农民升入业余中学
    新华社南京16日电　江苏省三十万农民在业余初等学校毕业以后，进入业余中等学校，使全省农村业余教育事业跨进一个新的阶段。
    江苏省农村为适应业余初等学校毕业的农民需要，举办了大批业余初中和业余初级技术学校，进一步提高农民群众的文化水平。业余初中设有政治、语文、数学、理化、农业知识等课程。业余初级技术学校课程由各地根据需要自行决定，一般是技术课的份量多于文化课。
    各地业余中等学校学习密切结合生产进行，按照“农闲每天学，小忙隔天学，大忙机动学，学习不中断”的原则安排学习时间。在日长夜短生产较忙的时期，每晚学习二小时，在日短夜长生产较闲的冬春期间，每晚学习三小时，全年除夏、秋忙假和春节假以外，课堂学习时间在四百小时左右，做到生产、学习两不误。
    业余中等学校的师资，主要采取就地取材、能者为师、自力更生、水涨船高的办法解决，一般是，政治课由公社党委书记或大队支部书记担任；农业知识和技术课由公社农业科学研究所或技术推广站的技术人员担任；文化课在群众中选聘条件适当的人担任。还有一部分业余初中，聘请小学教师、农中教师、公社业余教育辅导员兼课。
    为了培养业余中等学校师资，各县目前正在开办工农师范，准备将来为重点业余中学配备一定数量的专职教师。江阴、如?、溧阳等县还举办了半耕半读师范和业余师范。不少业余中学并采取与普通中学、农业中学挂钩的办法，成立教学研究组，用相互听课、定期观摩教学等办法，培养提高业余中学的教师。
    在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，江苏省1958年扫盲运动蓬勃开展，这一年扫除的文盲等于过去八年扫盲总数的七倍。广大农民摆脱文盲状态以后，各地又风起云涌地大量创办业余初等学校。经过两年来的学习，部分业余初等学校的学员已达到相当于高小毕业的水平，他们迫切要求进一步学习文化科学知识，学习技术。因此，参加业余初中和业余初级技术学校学习的三十万农民入校后，学习积极性普遍高涨，他们的政治觉悟和文化技术水平进一步提高。很多业余初中和业余初等技术学校的学员都有大片丰产试验田，建立了科学研究小组和工具改革实验小组等，他们把学得的知识运用在生产上，迅速出现了不少革新和创造。
    现在，江苏省农民业余中等学校在公社党委领导下正蓬勃发展，全省有五千多农民并进入了业余高中学习。
