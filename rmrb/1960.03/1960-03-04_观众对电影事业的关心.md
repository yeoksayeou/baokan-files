Audience Concerns About the Film Industry

    Hoping for a Wider Range of Movie Themes
    Li Zidong, Harbin, Heilongjiang
    Our films are gradually reflecting a wider range of aspects. From the films, we can see the heroic images and deeds of workers, farmers, and other laborers, and receive a lot of education. But I think the themes of movies need to be even broader.
    For example, under the leadership of the Party for the past ten years, the education sector has also made brilliant achievements, especially after implementing the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor. The achievements are enormous. Millions of teachers are working selflessly on the road of being both red and expert, tirelessly working to cultivate communist new people. Millions of students are participating in labor and production with workers and farmers, transforming their thinking, and learning practical knowledge. In this ordinary work, educators and students have created many extraordinary deeds, and many advanced figures have emerged in their studies and labor. However, there are not many films reflecting the lives of young students and the reform of teaching and ideological transformation. I hope that filmmakers will not only reflect on the vivid deeds in this field, encourage young students across the country to bravely advance on the road to being red and expert, but also widely reflect the achievements and heroic deeds in various fields.

    Attach Importance to Film Literature Scripts
    Zhao Qijun, Beijing
    With the rapid development of the film art industry, film literature scripts have also greatly developed. Publications such as "Film Literature" and "Film Creation" and many excellent film literature scripts have been published. This is exciting. However, I feel that not enough attention has been paid to film literature scripts.
    For example, some "Introduction to Literature," "Introduction to Literary Theory," and other literary theory works, as well as articles such as "Lectures on Literary Knowledge" in literary journals, rarely mention film literature scripts when discussing literary styles. As for the Chinese departments of universities, although there are courses in literary theory and similar "Selected Readings of Modern Works," film literature is not mentioned. In literary criticism, except for professional publications, there are also few evaluations of film literature scripts. I hope that the literary and art circles, especially critics, can pay attention to it, so that this new flower in literature and art can receive more care and better cultivation.

    Welcome "Newsreel"
    Zu Yixue, Shenyang, Liaoning
    Almost every time before a movie is shown, someone always asks, "Is 'Newsreel' being shown?" This question expresses the audience's welcome to "Newsreel." Although these films are short, they are full of infectiousness and educational significance, timely reflecting the ever-changing face of the motherland, vividly conveying the good news of socialist construction in various work posts, and expressing today's poetic and picturesque leaping era from many different angles.
    I hope that theaters will show "Newsreel" more often, and I also hope that these films will be made more and better, giving full play to the role of news documentaries as "visual political commentary," to show our new things, to promote the Party's policies, and to continuously educate and encourage the vast audience.

    More Publicity Needed
    Song Jiaren, Tongxin County, Ningxia
    Not long ago, I went with a friend who usually doesn't like to watch news documentaries to see the large-scale color documentary "Celebrating Ten Years" "The Tenth Spring" and others. After watching it, my friend changed his view of news documentaries. We believe that news documentaries are the vanguards of our film genres. It can reflect the great leap forward situation of "one day equals twenty years" and the ever-changing face of the motherland in a timely and profound manner; encourage people's political enthusiasm, revolutionary ambition, and lofty aspirations for building socialism, and can also directly introduce some knowledge or common sense to the audience, enriching people's cultural life.
    However, at present, not everyone pays attention to and is familiar with this film genre, and some comrades rarely watch news documentaries. I think this is because the publicity and evaluation of it are not enough. Therefore, I hope that newspapers, periodicals, radio stations, and film distribution and screening units will strengthen the publicity and recommendation of news documentaries. For example, recently, a high tide of studying Chairman Mao's works has been set off across the country. I think we can re-screen relevant films, such as the documentaries "Liberated China," "The Victory of the Chinese People," "Millions of Soldiers Cross the Yangtze River," and other related feature films, in conjunction with the study, to play the role of the films as visualized and vivid textbooks.
    At the same time, I also hope that news documentary filmmakers will vigorously improve the ideological and artistic quality of the films, and strengthen their combat effectiveness and artistic appeal.

### 观众对电影事业的关心

    观众对电影事业的关心
    希望电影题材更广泛些
    黑龙江哈尔滨  李子栋
    我们的电影所反映的方面逐渐宽广，从影片里我们能看到工农业和其他劳动岗位上的英雄形象和他们的事迹，受到很多教育。但是我觉得电影的题材还需要更广泛些。
    举一例来说，十年来在党的领导下，教育事业也取得了辉煌的成就，特别是贯彻党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针之后，成绩是巨大的。千百万教师们在又红又专的道路上，不辞辛苦地为培养共产主义新人忘我地劳动着；千百万学生和工人农民一起参加劳动、生产，改造自己思想，学习实际知识。在这平凡的工作中，教育工作者和学生们创造了许多不平凡的事迹，在他们的学习劳动中，也涌现出许多先进的人物。可是，在电影里反映青年学生生活和教学改革、思想改造的还不多。我希望电影工作者不但对这一岗位上的生动事迹，能作些反映，鼓舞全国青年学生向红透专深的道路奋勇前进。而且希望广泛地反映各方面的成就和英雄事迹。
    重视电影文学剧本
    北京　赵其钧
    随着电影艺术事业的迅速发展，电影文学剧本也有了较大的发展，出版了“电影文学”、“电影创作”等刊物和不少优秀的电影文学剧本。这是令人兴奋的事。但是，我觉得对于电影文学剧本还没有引起足够的重视。
    例如一些“文学概论”、“文艺学概论”等文学理论著作，以及文学期刊上的“文学知识讲座”之类的文章，在论述文学样式时，对电影文学剧本却很少提及。至于高等院校的语文系，虽有文学理论和类似“现代作品选读”的课程，电影文学也没有被谈到。在文艺评论中，除专业刊物外，也很少对电影文学剧本作评价。我希望文艺界特别是评论工作者能给以重视，让这朵文艺上的新花得到更多的关怀和更好的培育。
    欢迎“新闻简报”
    辽宁沈阳　祖一学
    几乎每次在电影放映以前，总有人问：“加演‘新闻简报’吗？”这句问话，表达了观众对“新闻简报”的欢迎。这种片子虽短，却富有感染力和教育意义，及时反映了祖国日新月异的面貌，生动地传出了各个工作岗位上建设社会主义的捷报，从许多不同的角度，表现了今天这个如诗如画的跃进时代。
    我希望影院多加演“新闻简报”，也希望这种片子拍得更多更好，充分发挥新闻纪录片的“形象化的政论”的作用，来表现我们的新事物，来宣传党的方针政策，不断教育和鼓舞广大观众。
    要多宣传
    宁夏同心县　宋家仁
    不久前，我和一位平时不爱看新闻纪录片的朋友去看了大型彩色纪录片“欢庆十年”“第十个春天”等。看过以后，我的朋友改变了他对新闻纪录片的看法。我们认为新闻纪录片，是我们电影片种里的尖兵。它能够及时而深刻地反映“一天等于二十年”的大跃进的形势和瞬息万变的祖国的面貌；鼓舞人们的政治热情，革命的雄心，建设社会主义的壮志，还能较直接地介绍一些知识或常识给观众，丰富人们的文化生活。
    可是目前，对于这一片种，还不是大家都很重视和熟悉的，有些同志就很少看新闻纪录片。我觉得这是对它的宣传评介做得不够。因此，希望报纸刊物广播电台和电影发行放映工作单位，加强对新闻纪录片的宣传、推荐工作。比如最近，全国掀起了学习毛主席著作的高潮，我觉得就可以把有关的影片，如纪录片“解放了的中国”、“中国人民的胜利”、“百万雄师下江南”等和其他有关的故事片，配合学习来复映，发挥影片的形象化的生动的教科书的作用。
    同时，也希望新闻纪录电影工作者大力提高影片的思想性和艺术性，加强它的战斗性和艺术感染力量。
