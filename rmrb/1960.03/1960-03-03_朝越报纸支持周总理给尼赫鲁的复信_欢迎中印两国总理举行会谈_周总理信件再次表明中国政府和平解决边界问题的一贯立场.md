Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 2nd. The "Rodong Sinmun" of North Korea published a commentary on March 1st entitled "Important Progress in Resolving the Sino-Indian Border Issue" regarding Premier Zhou Enlai's reply to Indian Prime Minister Nehru on February 26th, expressing welcome and support for the talks between the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers.

The commentary stated that Premier Zhou Enlai's letter to Nehru on the 26th once again clearly demonstrated the consistently peace-loving position taken by the Government of the People's Republic of China in peacefully resolving the border issue and maintaining and consolidating the friendly relations between China and India.

The commentary said that the upcoming talks between the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers are good news for all peace-loving people in Asia and the world. The commentary expressed hope that the upcoming talks between the two Prime Ministers will dispel the clouds floating between the two countries regarding the border issue.

The commentary mentioned the frantic "anti-China movement" stirred up by U.S. imperialism and the repeated provocative activities of a section of right-wing elements in India colluding with U.S. imperialism, pointing out that under such circumstances, the fact that the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers can hold talks is the result of the Chinese government consistently expressing its sincerity in resolving the border issue in a friendly and peaceful manner and making efforts to that end.

The commentary said that the upcoming talks between the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers will be a major blow to the U.S. imperialist aggressors who attempt to exploit the border issue to artificially intensify the dispute between the Chinese and Indian peoples in order to seek bloody gains like a fisherman.

The commentary expressed hope that the upcoming talks between the two Prime Ministers will find a way to resolve the border issue in a friendly and peaceful manner.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 2nd. The Vietnamese "Nhan Dan" published a commentary on March 1st, welcoming the upcoming talks between the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers. The newspaper's commentary, in discussing Premier Zhou Enlai's letter to Prime Minister Nehru on February 26th, said that this decision by China opens up good prospects for resolving the Sino-Indian border issue and is a gratifying matter.

The commentary, entitled "Resolving the Sino-Indian Border Issue Through Consultation is Beneficial to Both Sides," stated that the famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, advocated by the Chinese and Indian Prime Ministers in 1954, are regarded as a model of equal and friendly international relations. The friendly relations between China and India are very precious to the people of both countries and to the people of all countries in Asia.

The commentary pointed out that in the past period, imperialism has tried every means to exploit the Sino-Indian border issue, attempting to slander and distort China's peaceful diplomatic policy and alienate Sino-Indian relations. All the means of imperialism and its running dogs are aimed at realizing a conspiracy that they have always adopted for hundreds of years and are still adopting now, which is to alienate the Asian people in order to make a comeback and invade and rule the Asian people.

The commentary emphasized that the era of imperialism doing whatever it wants has passed. The Asian people are determined to defend peace, to defend the friendship between all nations established on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Conference resolutions, and they are fully capable of resolving their internal disputes themselves, preserving and consolidating their strength, and concentrating their strength to oppose the common enemy—imperialism and colonialism. The commentary said that the recent Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression and the Agreement on the Border Issue between China and Burma are shining examples of resolving existing problems between Asian countries.

The commentary concluded by saying that imperialism and its running dogs will never be reconciled to abandoning their despicable conspiracies to alienate and undermine Sino-Indian relations. However, we believe that the governments and peoples of China and India will defeat these conspiracies and reach a resolution of the Sino-Indian border issue through friendly consultations.

    朝越报纸支持周总理给尼赫鲁的复信
    欢迎中印两国总理举行会谈
    周总理信件再次表明中国政府和平解决边界问题的一贯立场
    新华社平壤2日电　朝鲜“劳动新闻”1日就中国总理周恩来在2月26日写给印度总理尼赫鲁的复信发表题为“解决中印边界问题的重要进展”的评论，表示欢迎和支持中印两国总理举行会谈。
    评论说，周恩来总理26日写给尼赫鲁的复信再次清楚地表明中华人民共和国政府为和平解决边界问题和维护、巩固中印两国之间的友好关系而采取的始终一贯的爱好和平的立场。
    评论说，中印两国总理将举行会谈，这对亚洲和世界一切爱好和平的人民来说是一个好消息。评论表示希望两国总理将要举行的会谈将能驱散围绕着边界问题飘浮在两国之间的乌云。
    评论谈到美帝国主义挑起的疯狂的“反华运动”和同美帝国主义相勾结的印度一部分右翼分子的一再的挑衅活动后，指出，在这种情况下，中印两国总理能够举行会谈，是中国政府为友好和平地解决边界问题一贯表示了它的诚意，并且进行了努力的结果。
    评论说，中印两国总理将举行会谈，对企图利用边界问题人为地加剧中印两国人民间的争端以便从中追求血腥的渔翁之利的美帝国主义侵略者，是一个很大的打击。
    评论表示希望两国总理将要举行的会谈将能找出友好和平地解决边界问题的途径。
    新华社河内2日电　越南“人民报”1日发表评论，欢迎中印两国总理即将举行会谈。这家报纸评论在谈到周恩来总理在2月26日写给尼赫鲁总理的信时说，中国这个决定，为解决中印边界问题打开了良好前景，是一件可喜的事情。
    这篇题为“通过协商方式解决中印边界问题对双方都是有利的”的评论说，中印两国总理在1954年所倡议的著名的和平共处五项原则，被看成平等、友好的国际关系的典范。中印两国的友好关系对两国人民和对亚洲所有国家的人民都是非常宝贵的。
    评论指出，在过去一段时间中，帝国主义利用中印边界问题想尽办法，企图污蔑和歪曲中国的和平外交政策，离间中印关系。帝国主义及其走狗的一切手段，其目的都是为了实现它们几百年来一向采取、现在还在采取的一个阴谋，就是离间亚洲人民，以便卷土重来，侵略和统治亚洲人民。
    评论强调指出，但是帝国主义为所欲为的时代已经过去了。亚洲人民决心保卫和平，保卫在和平共处五项原则和万隆会议决议的基础上建立起来的各民族之间的友谊，他们完全能够自己解决内部的争端，来保全和巩固自己的力量，并且把力量集中起来反对共同的敌人——帝国主义和殖民主义。评论说，中国和缅甸最近签订的友好和互不侵犯条约以及关于两国边界问题的协定，就是解决亚洲国家之间存在的问题的光辉榜样。
    评论最后说，帝国主义及其走狗绝不会甘心放弃它们离间和破坏中印关系的卑劣阴谋。但是我们相信中国和印度两国的政府和人民将击败这些阴谋，通过友好协商的方式，达成中印边界问题的解决。
