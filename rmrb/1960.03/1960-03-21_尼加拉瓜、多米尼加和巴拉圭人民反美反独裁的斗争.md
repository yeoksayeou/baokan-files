    The Struggle of the People of Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, and Paraguay Against the U.S. and Dictatorship

    I
    Since the beginning of 1959, the unprecedented upsurge of the anti-U.S. and anti-dictatorial struggles of the people of Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, and Paraguay has been a prominent feature of the development of the national democratic movement of the Latin American people after the victory of the Cuban Revolution.
    There are reasons why the anti-imperialist and anti-dictatorial struggles in these three countries have risen to an unprecedented level and developed into armed struggles.
    As is well known, the dictatorial regimes in these three countries are loyal pawns cultivated by U.S. imperialism, through which the United States controls and plunders these countries. In Nicaragua, U.S. monopoly enterprises control all gold and silver mining and the timber industry, seizing huge profits. In the Dominican Republic, U.S. monopoly enterprises control more than four-fifths of sugar production, which accounts for more than 60% of the country's national income, and vast tracts of arable land; U.S. banks control the economic lifeline of the Dominican Republic and own their own railways, seaports, etc. In Paraguay, U.S. monopoly capital controls the country's main resource, oil, and occupies vast tracts of fertile land (one U.S. coffee company alone occupies 300,000 hectares).
    The dictatorial regimes in these three countries are also regimes representing the big landowners and big capitalists. In these countries, a very small number of big landowners, together with U.S. companies, occupy the vast majority of the land. For example, in Nicaragua, 362 large landowners (mainly the Somoza family) own one-third of the arable land, while 26,000 farmers own only 5.62%; in Paraguay, 1,500 large landowners own three-quarters of the country's land, while landless farmers account for 94% of the total number of farmers; in the Dominican Republic, the dictator Trujillo alone owns more than half of the country's fertile land, while landless farmers account for more than 80% of the rural population.
    In politics, these dictatorial regimes implement bloody terror rule, deprive the people of all democratic and free rights, and frantically persecute communists and other patriotic and progressive elements, throwing them into prisons or concentration camps, killing them, or exiling them in large numbers. In order to suppress the people's resistance, they all maintain huge police and armed forces.
    Under such cruel exploitation and oppression by U.S. imperialism and the dictatorial regimes, the people have never stopped their struggle. In recent years, the downfall of one dictatorial regime after another in Latin America has greatly encouraged them. In particular, the victory of the Cuban Revolution has shown them the road to their own liberation. Therefore, in 1959, they successively pushed the struggle to a new stage—the stage of armed struggle.
    II
    On May 31, 1959, Nicaraguan conservative youths landed in central Nicaragua by plane from Costa Rica, igniting the fire of armed struggle. Soon after, an armed struggle commanded by Independent Liberal Party members broke out, and then people in many regions successively revolted. The anti-dictatorial army quickly grew to more than 800 people, conducting guerrilla activities in the provinces of Matagalpa, León, Madriz, Segovia, and Rivas.
    Encouraged by the armed uprising, the domestic people's movement has further surged. The working class launched a general strike against tyranny at the same time as the armed uprising broke out, paralyzing more than 80% of the domestic economy. Immediately afterwards, students in León, Nicaragua's second largest city, and the capital, held several huge demonstrations despite the bloody massacres by the dictatorial regime, fully demonstrating the Nicaraguan people's strong will to resist dictatorship.
    Faced with the people's growing resistance, the dictatorial regime, on the one hand, more frantically persecuted patriotic and progressive elements, and on the other hand, also attempted to use some deceptive means (such as expressing its intention to hold so-called "free" elections) to ease the people's dissatisfaction. While fully supporting the dictatorial regime, U.S. imperialism also actively prepared to establish a military committee government to replace it if the regime could not continue to maintain itself, and even prepared to carry out armed intervention through certain vassal states if necessary.
    III
    Half a month after the outbreak of the Nicaraguan people's armed uprising, the Dominican people also launched an armed struggle. After the anti-dictatorial army landed in the northern part of the Dominican Republic, it quickly penetrated into the mountainous areas of Estero Hondo, Maimón, and Constanza to conduct guerrilla activities, and later developed to Baytoa, Copey, and Bajabonico and other places. The dictatorial regime used thousands of troops to deal with the anti-dictatorial army, repeatedly declaring that it had eliminated the rebel army, and repeatedly having to admit that "there are still bandits in the mountains." Recently, a leader of the Dominican liberation movement told the Rio de Janeiro "Tribuna da Imprensa" that there are currently 500 guerrillas fighting in the central and northern mountainous areas of the Dominican Republic, and they are supported by the farmers in these areas.
    The outbreak of the armed struggle promoted the rapid recovery and vigorous development of the people's movement at home, which had been severely damaged by the dictatorial regime. Since the beginning of this year, the anti-dictatorial wave has spread to all levels of society throughout the country. In late January, a large-scale anti-Trujillo incident broke out, involving people from all walks of life, including workers and senior military officers, who were preparing to launch an armed rebellion. Immediately afterwards, there were three incidents of clashes between demonstrating crowds and the military police of the dictatorial regime. Even American experts in Washington, when assessing the situation in the Dominican Republic, admitted that the Trujillo regime was facing "the most powerful resistance in more than 30 years."
    As for U.S. imperialism, it has always supported Trujillo, the most brutal ruler in Latin American history. For example, after the outbreak of the people's armed uprising, U.S. imperialism provided him with a loan of 11.5 million U.S. dollars through the "International Monetary Fund." Recently, because he was in a precarious situation, the United States sent 4,000 Marines to land in the Dominican Republic. As the "New York Times" admitted, the purpose of U.S. imperialism's move was to control the situation in order to prevent the Dominican people from overthrowing the dictatorial regime and establishing an independent and autonomous government as in Cuba. Only because of the condemnation of world public opinion did the United States have to withdraw these troops.
    IV
    The struggle of the Paraguayan people against dictatorship began to surge from 1955. On the "May Day" of that year, the leadership of the Paraguayan Labor Confederation, which was controlled by the police, convened a public meeting. The workers who attended the meeting immediately held a demonstration, shouting slogans such as "We want democracy, not dictatorship!" From then on, the struggles of workers, peasants, and students became increasingly frequent, culminating in the national general strike in August and September 1958. The scale of this general strike was unprecedented in Paraguay, and the dictator was therefore forced to release all those arrested during the strike.
    In just a few months after the general strike, the anti-dictatorial struggle developed to a new peak. In May 1959, the struggle of young students against the increase in ticket prices quickly formed a massive anti-dictatorial mass movement, and the dictatorial regime was forced to reimpose martial law to suppress the demonstrating masses. In July, when the Labor Confederation held a congress, the vast majority of union representatives rose up to oppose the police chief in the leadership of the confederation, passed a resolution supporting the students' struggle, and called on workers to be vigilant and prepare for a new general strike. The dictatorial regime had to retreat and announced the cancellation of the measure to increase ticket prices.
    The armed struggle of the Paraguayan people broke out on December 12, 1959, in such a high tide of anti-dictatorial struggle. Recently, according to a report by Latin American news agencies, there are also guerrilla activities in the Guinddy and Caaguazú regions.
    U.S. imperialism also expressed a lack of confidence in whether the Paraguayan dictatorial regime could continue to maintain itself. On the one hand, it gave strong support to the dictatorial regime, and on the other hand, it actively contacted coup plotters and the right wing within the anti-dictatorial forces, attempting either to end the armed struggle that had already broken out through compromise with certain leaders in the government army, or to establish a government composed of military leaders who were loyal to the U.S. General Staff and U.S. oil companies that had obtained concessions in the Chaco.
    V
    Although the anti-dictatorial struggles of the people of these three countries have entered the stage of armed struggle, the road to struggle is still arduous, tortuous, and complex. This is partly because U.S. imperialism is carrying out various conspiracies in an attempt to prevent the victory of the Cuban Revolution from being repeated in these countries, and the dictatorial regimes in these countries, which have long been strongly supported by U.S. imperialism, will never automatically withdraw from the political stage; on the other hand, it is because the anti-dictatorial forces, especially the rebel troops, in these three countries still need to be further united.
    However, the contradictions between the people of these three countries and U.S. imperialism and the dictatorial regimes have reached a very acute point. The dictatorial regimes' frenzied suppression has not weakened the people's resistance, but has instead made the people's struggle more vigorous, making themselves more isolated, and internal divisions more expanded, while U.S. imperialism's full support for these dictatorial regimes will also accelerate the awakening of the people of these countries, making them more clearly aware of their most vicious enemies.
    Since the people have already seen the road to liberate themselves and have already risen up to fight, no matter what setbacks they may encounter, they will continue to move forward. They have received and will continue to receive increasingly strong support from the people of the world, especially the people of Latin America, until they achieve final victory.

    尼加拉瓜、多米尼加和巴拉圭人民反美反独裁的斗争
    秦青
    一
    从1959年初到现在，尼加拉瓜、多米尼加和巴拉圭人民反美和反独裁斗争的空前高涨，是古巴革命胜利以后拉丁美洲人民民族民主运动发展的一个突出的特点。
    这三个国家的反帝反独裁斗争之所以空前高涨，并发展为武装斗争，不是没有原因的。
    如所周知，这三个国家的独裁政权都是美帝国主义培植起来的忠实走狗，美国通过它们对这些国家进行控制和掠夺。在尼加拉瓜，美国垄断企业控制了全部金银开采业和木材业，攫取大量利润。在多米尼加，美国垄断企业控制占该国国民收入60％以上的蔗糖生产的五分之四以上和广大的可耕地；美国银行控制了多米尼加的经济命脉，并且拥有自己的铁路、海港等。在巴拉圭，美国垄断资本控制了这个国家的主要资源石油，并霸占大量肥沃土地（仅仅一家美国咖啡公司就占地三十万公顷）。
    这三个国家的独裁政权又都是代表大地主大资本家的政权。在这些国家，为数极少的大地主同美国公司一起占有了绝大部分的土地。例如在尼加拉瓜，三百六十二个大地主（主要是独裁者索摩查家族）占有可耕地的三分之一，而二万六千农民只占有5．62％；在巴拉圭，一千五百个大地主占有全国土地的四分之三，而无地农民占农民总数的94％；在多米尼加，仅仅独裁者特鲁希略本人就拥有全国肥沃土地一半以上，而无地农民占农村人口的80％以上。
    在政治上，这些独裁政权实行血腥的恐怖统治，剥夺人民一切民主自由权利，疯狂迫害共产党人及其他爱国进步分子，把他们大批地投入牢狱或集中营、杀害或放逐。为了镇压人民的反抗，他们都保持庞大的警察和武装部队。
    人民在美帝国主义和独裁政权这样残酷的剥削和压迫之下，从来没有停止过斗争，近年来拉丁美洲独裁政权一个一个倒台，给予他们很大鼓舞，特别是古巴革命的胜利，使他们看到了自己解放的道路，因而他们在1959年相继把斗争推上新的阶段——武装斗争的阶段。
    二
    1959年5月31日，尼加拉瓜保守派青年从哥斯达黎加乘飞机在尼加拉瓜中部降落，点起了武装斗争之火，不久之后又爆发了独立自由党人指挥的武装斗争，接着好些地区人民相继起义。反独裁军很快就发展到八百多人，在马塔加耳帕、雷翁、马德里斯、塞哥维亚、里瓦斯等省进行游击活动。
    在武装起义的鼓舞下，国内人民运动也进一步高涨。工人阶级在武装起义爆发的同时举行了一次反对暴政的总罢工，使国内经济80％以上陷于瘫痪。紧接着，尼加拉瓜第二大城雷翁和首都的学生又不顾独裁政权的血腥屠杀，举行了几次巨大的示威，充分表现出尼加拉瓜人民反独裁的坚强意志。
    面临人民日益增长的反抗，独裁政权一方面更加疯狂地迫害爱国进步分子，另方面也妄图用一些欺骗手段（如表示要举行所谓
  “自由”选举）来缓和人民的不满。美帝国主义在全力支持独裁政权的同时，也积极准备如果这个政权无法继续维持下去时就建立一个军事委员会政府来代替它，甚至准备必要时通过某些仆从国家进行武装干涉。
    三
    在尼加拉瓜人民武装起义爆发后半个月，多米尼加人民也展开了武装斗争，反独裁军在多米尼加北部登陆后，很快就深入埃斯特罗洪多、马伊蒙和康斯坦萨等地山区进行游击活动，后来又发展到巴伊托亚、哥贝伊和巴哈尼哥等地。独裁政权用了数千人的军队来对付反独裁军，多次宣布已经消灭了起义军，也多次不得不承认“山上仍然有土匪”。最近一位多米尼加解放运动领袖向里约热内卢“论坛报”说，目前多米尼加有五百名游击队员在中部山区和北部山区进行斗争，他们得到这些地区农民的支持。
    武装斗争的爆发促使国内受到独裁政权严重破坏了的人民运动的迅速恢复和蓬勃发展。今年以来，反独裁浪潮已波及全国各阶层。1月下旬爆发了大规模反对特鲁希略的事件，参与这次事件的有各阶层人士，其中包括工人和高级军官，他们准备举行武装暴动。紧接着又发生了三次示威群众同独裁政权军警冲突的事件。连华盛顿的美国专家在估计多米尼加局势时也承认特鲁希略政权正面临“三十多年来最有力的反抗”。
    至于美帝国主义，它一贯支持特鲁希略这个在拉丁美洲历史上最为残暴的统治者。例如在人民武装起义爆发后美帝国主义就通过“国际货币基金组织”给他一千一百五十万美元的贷款，最近由于他陷入朝不保夕的境地，美国曾派了四千名海军陆战队在多米尼加登陆。正如“纽约时报”所招认的，美帝国主义此举的目的在于控制局势，以阻止多米尼加人民推翻独裁政权并像在古巴那样建立一个独立自主的政府。只是由于全世界舆论的谴责，美国才不得不撤回这些军队。
    四
    巴拉圭人民反独裁的斗争从1955年就开始高涨。在这一年的“五一”节，受警察控制的巴拉圭劳工联合会的领导机构召集了一次公众大会，参加这次大会的工人群众当场举行示威，高呼“要民主，不要独裁！”的口号。从那时起，工人、农民和学生的斗争就日趋频繁，而以1958年8、9月间的全国总罢工为高峰。这次总罢工声势之大，在巴拉圭空前未有，独裁者因此被迫释放全部在罢工时被捕的人。
    这次总罢工之后，仅仅几个月中，反独裁斗争又发展到新的高峰。1959年5月青年学生反对车票涨价的斗争，很快就形成了声势浩大的反独裁的群众运动，独裁政权被迫重新恢复戒严，镇压示威群众。7月间劳工联合会举行代表大会时，绝大多数工会代表起来反对该会领导机构中的警察头子，通过支持学生斗争的决议，并号召工人提高警惕，准备一次新的总罢工。独裁政权不得不退却，宣布取消提高车票价的措施。
    巴拉圭人民的武装斗争就是在这样反独裁斗争的高潮中在1959年12月12日爆发的。最近据拉丁美洲通讯社的报道说，在基因迪和卡瓜苏地区也有游击队活动。
    对巴拉圭独裁政权能否继续维持下去，美帝国主义也同样表现没有信心，它一面给予独裁政权大力支持，另一方面则积极同政变分子及反独裁力量内部的右派联系，企图或者使已经爆发的武装斗争同政府军队中某些首领妥协而结束，或者建立一个由那些效忠于美国参谋部及在厦谷取得了租让的美国石油公司的军事首领组成的政府来代替斯特罗斯纳。
    五
    这三个国家人民的反独裁斗争虽然已经进入武装斗争阶段，但是斗争道路仍然是艰巨、曲折和复杂的。这一方面是因为美帝国主义正在施展各种阴谋，力图使古巴革命的胜利不会在这些国家重演，而这些国家的独裁政权长期得到美帝国主义大力支持，也决不会自动退出政治舞台；另一方面是因为这三个国家的反独裁力量特别是起义部队，还有待进一步团结起来。
    但是，这三个国家人民同美帝国主义及独裁政权的矛盾已到非常尖锐的地步。独裁政权的疯狂镇压并没有减弱人民的反抗，反而使人民的斗争更加蓬勃发展，使自己更加孤立，内部分歧更加扩大，而美帝国主义全力支持这些独裁政权，也将加速这些国家人民的觉醒，使他们更清楚地认识他们最凶恶的敌人。
    人民既然已经看到了解放自己的道路，而且已经起来斗争，不管还会遭到什么挫折，他们将继续前进，他们已经得到而且将继续得到全世界人民特别是拉丁美洲人民日益有力的支持，直到取得最后胜利。
