Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 27th. Some Indian newspapers warmly welcome the upcoming talks between Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister Nehru on April 19th in New Delhi and express hope for the success of the talks. Other newspapers also welcome the talks and hope for their success, but simultaneously published some comments unfavorable to the talks.

The latest issue of the Indian Communist Party's "New Age" weekly published an editorial welcoming Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to New Delhi on April 19th for talks with Prime Minister Nehru, and expressed "deep hope for the success of the Zhou-Nehru talks."

The editorial stated: "Similar issues between China and Burma, and between China and Nepal, have been successfully resolved in a spirit of friendship on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This resolution is rightly welcomed as a further consolidation of Afro-Asian solidarity, and is a matter of pride for Afro-Asian solidarity. This resolution is a heavy blow to the evil conspiracies of imperialists who attempt to use such differences to sow discord in Asian unity on a bankrupt anti-communist basis." The editorial said that the peaceful resolution of the problems between these two great Asian nations will greatly advance the sound historical process that began in Bandung, a process that imperialism has been trying in vain to undermine in every possible way.

The editorial pointed out that in India, only the leaders of the Indian People's Alliance and the People's Socialist Party are clamoring in opposition. "They are panicked and deliberately malicious." The editorial called on the Indian people to welcome this important moment and make every effort to contribute.

The latest issue of the Urdu weekly "People's Century" published an editorial stating: "Throughout India, there is great excitement about the announcement of Zhou Enlai's upcoming visit to India and the news that he will stay here for a week of negotiations." The weekly pointed out that China's peaceful settlement of border disputes with Burma and Nepal fully demonstrates the thinking and attitude of the Chinese leaders. The weekly said: "The time has come for a peaceful settlement of the Sino-Indian border dispute. We should strive to make the upcoming historical meeting between the two prime ministers a success and create an atmosphere conducive to the talks."

The editorial condemned the reactionary Indian People's Alliance, the National Volunteer Corps, and other "war-mongering parties that peddle hatred." It said: "Today, the Indian people are awakened. They know what is good and what is bad, and they can distinguish between their friends and enemies. It is no longer possible to deceive them."

The Bengali daily "Freedom" published an editorial on the 23rd, stating that at a banquet held by the Prime Minister of Nepal after the signing of the border agreement with China, the Chinese Premier said that there are no problems between Asian and African countries that cannot be resolved on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The editorial said: "China is using this attitude to resolve border issues and other problems with Burma. The Chinese Premier will also come to India with this attitude."

The editorial condemned certain people in India who hope to undermine Afro-Asian solidarity and who will try to create obstacles. The newspaper said, "We must actively strive to ensure that the upcoming Sino-Indian talks can be conducted in an atmosphere of mutual trust and friendship, and be successful. We are convinced that the outcome of the anticipated Indian-Chinese talks will be another serious defeat for the enemies of Afro-Asian solidarity."

The Bengali "Epoch-Making News" published an editorial on the 23rd, saying that Premier Zhou Enlai's letter regarding the date of his visit to India was "good news." The editorial said, "We hope that the two Prime Ministers will succeed in this area (the border issue)." The editorial believes that "from Zhou Enlai's recent letter, acceptance of the invitation to visit Delhi, and decision to stay in Delhi for a week, it seems that he sincerely hopes to resolve the Sino-Indian border dispute." However, the editorial repeated the fallacy that so-called "Chinese aggression" damaged Sino-Indian friendly relations.

"Glory Daily" also published an editorial on the same day, hoping for the success of the talks and that there would not be major differences between the two prime ministers in the talks. The newspaper welcomed the success of the border agreements signed by China with Burma and Nepal, saying that this indicates that the talks between China and India will also be successful. But it also said, "If the Sino-Indian talks fail, the agreements between China and Nepal and Burma will also be affected."

Murugan, the editor of "The Hindustan Times," argued in a commentary on the 23rd that Zhou Enlai's visit to India "is not something to be completely happy about." He repeated the fallacy of requiring "China to withdraw its aggression" and advocated that there should be no "diplomatic temporary calm" during the negotiations, and that a "fierce atmosphere" should be maintained as the negotiations approach.

    印度一些报刊欢迎中印总理会谈
    另一些报纸在欢迎周总理访印的同时又发表不利会谈的言论
    新华社新德里27日电　印度一些报纸热烈欢迎周恩来总理同尼赫鲁总理4月19日在新德里会谈，并且希望会谈成功。另一些报纸也欢迎这次会谈和希望会谈成功，但同时发表了一些不利于会谈的言论。
    最近一期印度共产党的“新世纪”周报发表社论，欢迎周恩来总理4月19日到新德里同尼赫鲁总理会谈，并表示“深切地希望周（恩来）—尼赫鲁会谈成功”。
    社论说：“在中国和缅甸之间以及中国和尼泊尔之间的类似的问题，已经本着友好的精神在（和平共处）五项原则的基础上成功地解决。这种解决理所当然地受到欢迎，被认为是亚非团结的进一步巩固，对亚非团结来说也是值得自豪的事情。这种解决是对帝国主义者的罪恶阴谋的沉重打击，他们企图利用这种分歧在已告破产的反共的基础上来离间亚洲的团结。”社论说，和平解决了这两个伟大的亚洲国家之间的问题，将使在万隆开始的健全的历史过程大大向前推进一步，而帝国主义一直在徒劳地千方百计破坏这个过程。
    社论指出，在印度只有印度人民同盟和人民社会党的头子们在大肆叫嚣表示反对。“他们惊惶失措、蓄意作恶。”社论呼吁印度人民起来欢迎这个重大的时刻并且尽力作出贡献。
    最近一期的乌尔都文周报“人民世纪”发表社论说：“印度全国各地都十分兴奋地听到关于宣布周恩来将来印度的消息以及他将在这里逗留一星期举行谈判的消息。”这家周报指出，中国通过和平谈判同缅甸和尼泊尔解决了边界争端，这件事充分表明了中国领导人的想法和态度。周报说：“和平解决中印边界争端的时候已经来到。我们应该努力使两国总理这次具有历史意义的会谈取得成功，并且创造有利于会谈的气氛。”
    社论谴责反动的印度人民同盟、国民志愿团以及其他“谈论仇恨的贩卖战争的政党”。它说：“今天印度人民已经觉悟了。他们知道什么是好的，什么是坏的，他们能够区别他们的朋友和敌人。不再可能欺骗他们了。”
    孟加拉文日报“自由报”23日发表社论说，中国总理在同尼泊尔签订边界协定后尼泊尔首相举行的一次宴会上说，亚非各国之间没有任何问题不可以在和平共处五项原则的基础上求得解决。社论说：“中国正是用这种态度解决了同缅甸的边界问题和其他问题。中国总理也将抱着这种态度来到印度。”
    社论谴责印度某些希望破坏亚非团结的人，他们将设法制造障碍。这家报纸说，“我们必须积极努力，以使即将举行的中印会谈能够在互相信赖和友好的气氛中进行，并获得成功。我们坚信：预料中的印度同中国会谈的结果，将是亚非团结的敌人的又一次严重的失败。”
    孟加拉文的“划时代报”23日发表社论，说周恩来总理关于他访印日期的信件是个“好消息”。社论说，“我们希望两国总理在这方面（边界问题）会取得成功。”社论认为，“从周恩来最近的信件、接受访问德里的邀请和决定在德里逗留一周的事看来，似乎他是真诚希望解决中印边界争端的。”但是，社论又重复了所谓“中国侵略”损坏了中印友好关系的谬论。
    “光荣报”同一天也发表社论，希望会谈成功，希望两国总理在会谈中不会有很大分歧。这家报纸欢迎中国同缅甸、尼泊尔签订的边界协定的成功，它说，这表明中国同印度的会谈也会取得成功。但是它又说，“如果中印会谈失败，中国同尼泊尔和缅甸的协定也会受到影响。”
    “印度斯坦时报”主编穆尔岗卡23日在评论中认为：周恩来访问印度“不是一件可以完全感到高兴的事情”。他重复所谓要“中国撤消侵略”的谬论，并且鼓吹不要在谈判期间有“外交上的暂时的平静”，而且要在谈判将要来临之际，“保持炽烈的气氛”。
