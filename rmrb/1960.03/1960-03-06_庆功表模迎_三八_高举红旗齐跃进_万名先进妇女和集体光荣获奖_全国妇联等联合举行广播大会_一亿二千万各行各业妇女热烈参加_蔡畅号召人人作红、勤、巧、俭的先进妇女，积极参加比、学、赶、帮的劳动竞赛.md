Xinhua News Agency, March 5th: The All-China Women's Federation and nine other organizations, along with the Central People's Broadcasting Station, jointly held a broadcast rally this afternoon to celebrate achievements, commend models, welcome "March 8th," and encourage leaping forward while holding high the red banner. Ten thousand advanced women and advanced collectives—models for the nation's 380 million women—gloriously received "March 8th" Red Banner Pacesetter and "March 8th" Red Banner Collective awards. The rally called on women across the country to learn from their shining examples and redouble their efforts to achieve a continued great leap forward in 1960.

Today's rally was unprecedented in scale. From the frontier to the interior, from the coast to the mountains, our vast and expansive motherland was the venue for the broadcast rally. Over 120 million women of all ethnicities and from all walks of life participated in the rally.

This broadcast rally was jointly organized by ten units: the All-China Federation of Democratic Women, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China, the National Committee of the Science and Technology Association for the People's Republic of China, the All-China Youth Federation, the All China Students Federation, China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the Chinese People's National Committee for the Defence of Children, and the Central People's Broadcasting Station. Leaders of these organizations, including Cai Chang, Liu Ningyi, Hu Yaobang, Mao Dun, Chen Shaomin, Li Dequan, Shi Liang, Mao Yisheng, Xu Guangping, Zhang Yun, Yang Zhihua, Liu Qingyang, and Hu Qili, attended the broadcast rally.

The central venue for the rally was located at the Central People's Broadcasting Station. Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, spoke first. She extended her warmest congratulations to the sisters across the country, congratulating them on the great achievements they had made in socialist construction and congratulating the ten thousand "March 8th" Red Banner Pacesetters and "March 8th" Red Banner Collectives on the supreme glory they had received.

Cai Chang said that commending and awarding "March 8th" Red Banner Pacesetters and "March 8th" Red Banner Collectives at today's rally is of great significance. Commending and awarding them is their glory, as well as the glory of our sisters across the country, and it also sets an example for us sisters across the country to learn from.

Cai Chang said that the "March 8th" Red Banner Pacesetters and "March 8th" Red Banner Collectives have already set an advanced example for us. We must unite as one and actively learn from their excellent qualities and advanced experiences. The sisters who have been selected as "March 8th" Red Banner Pacesetters and "March 8th" Red Banner Collectives must fully develop the spirit of continuous revolution, continue to make new achievements, and truly become red banners that never fade. They must actively help the partners around them and advance together.

Cai Chang called on sisters in various positions to be determined to become advanced women of "Redness, Diligence, Skill, and Thrift," and actively participate in labor emulation campaigns of "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, and Help."

She concluded by saying, "Let us unite closely around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, hold high the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, redouble our efforts, leap forward, leap forward, and leap forward again, and strive valiantly to achieve a better and more comprehensive great leap forward in 1960."

Liu Ningyi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and Mao Yisheng, Vice Chairman of the National Science and Technology Association, spoke at the rally successively. They represented their respective organizations in extending warm congratulations to the broad masses of women across the country on International Working Women's Day on March 8th, and wished them to hold even higher the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and make even greater contributions to the cause of socialist construction in the motherland.

Liu Ningyi pointed out that all female workers must quickly devote themselves to the comprehensive movement of technical innovation and technical revolution.

Liu Ningyi said, "Now, the situation is infinitely good, our victory is great, and our future is infinitely bright. The glorious task before us is to make persistent efforts and advance victoriously. You must work together with all male workers and the people of the whole country to promote the socialist construction of our country faster and strive for a continued leap forward this year and a sustained leap forward in the 1960s. All female comrades, especially all female workers, must quickly devote themselves to the booming mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization. We must further liberate our minds, break superstitions, dare to think, dare to speak, dare to do, study diligently, and create boldly. Since the broad masses of female workers have become great warriors of socialist construction, they should fully rely on the strength and wisdom of the collective to realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of all manual labor. We should have the courage, confidence, and perseverance to conquer any cutting-edge science and technology."

Hu Yaobang, representing the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, congratulated the broad masses of women across the country for leaping forward, leaping forward, and leaping forward again while holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

Hu Yaobang said, "Since the Great Leap Forward, the women of our country have resolutely responded to the call of the Party and Chairman Mao, set high aspirations, established great ambitions, boosted their enthusiasm, strived for the top, and plunged into the booming socialist great competition, advancing shoulder to shoulder with male comrades. The heroic labor of women of all ethnic groups in our country on all fronts has not only fundamentally changed the social status of women in our country, but also powerfully promoted the high-speed development of the socialist cause. The women of our country have proved with practical actions what Chairman Mao said: Chinese women are a great human resource. The women of our country have shown with glorious facts that they are a great force loyal to the motherland, loyal to the people, and loyal to the general line." He said, "The power of women in our country is immense, holding up half the sky of the entire great cause. For such women, for such female comrades, the youth, the teenagers, and the future generations of our country will always remember them and respect them." He, representing the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, congratulated the broad masses of women across the country for leaping forward, leaping forward, and leaping forward again in the new year while holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought!

Mao Yisheng said that the Science and Technology Association's organizations in various places are willing to help female comrades march towards science faster.

Mao Yisheng said, "With the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture and the realization of people's communes, the broad masses of women have also been liberated from tedious housework and have embarked on industrial and agricultural production, collective life, welfare undertakings, social service undertakings, and other fronts, adding a huge new force to socialist construction. With the heroic spirit of 'women can do everything, and they can do everything well,' the broad masses of women have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party and Chairman Mao, broken superstitions, liberated their minds, promoted the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, and actively plunged into the mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution. A large number of female experts, red banner pacesetters, and skillful girls have emerged on various production fronts and life welfare fronts, fully demonstrating the infinite power and wisdom of women." He said that the Science and Technology Association's organizations in various places regard the work of training technical cadres and popularizing scientific knowledge as their important tasks and contribute our greatest strength to the upsurge of running spare-time education on a large scale across the country. We are willing to be a good assistant to the Party in this regard and help female comrades march towards science faster.

The speeches of Cai Chang, Liu Ningyi, Hu Yaobang, and Mao Yisheng were received with extremely warm welcome. During their speeches, thunderous applause continuously resounded in the venue.

Next, the All-China Women's Federation presented awards flags and certificates to ten thousand "March 8th" Red Banner Pacesetters and "March 8th" Red Banner Collectives. When the representatives of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions stepped onto the stage to receive the awards, the entire venue was active, the music of "We Are Red Female Heroes" sounded, and people applauded enthusiastically for a long time to the rhythm of the joyful music.

The emergence of these ten thousand and more advanced figures and advanced collectives is a concentrated reflection of the great progress of the broad masses of women across the country. They are the best representatives of the hardworking and brave working women of our country.

Advanced women from various places unanimously issued heroic vows, stating that they would make greater achievements for the continued leap forward this year.

After the awards were presented, outstanding female workers, female presidents of communes, female feeders, female shop assistants, and female researchers who won the titles of "March 8th Red Banner Pacesetter" and "March 8th Red Banner Collective" spoke at the meeting.

Their slogans are: Everyone should be a promoter on the political and ideological front, a red banner pacesetter on the production front, a model on the cultural front, and a pioneer of the technical revolution. When they spoke, people burst into thunderous applause, congratulating the women of the country on being more advanced, leaping forward again, and advancing from victory to greater victory in the new year.
