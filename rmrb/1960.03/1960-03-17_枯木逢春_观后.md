    After Seeing "Withered Tree Revives"
    Sun Wei Shi
    Yu Jiang County completely eradicated the root of schistosomiasis,
    The beloved leader was so excited in the deep night that he couldn't sleep,
    His heart was closely connected with the people of the motherland,
    And wrote the great poem "Farewell to the God of Plague"!
    The leader's poem stirred the heartstrings of the people,
    Turned into vivid images appearing on the stage,
    Staging the suffering past of the Chinese people,
    Singing the happy today of the Chinese people!
    On the land of wailing ghosts and howling gods, weeds are rampant,
    Now it has become a beautiful landscape and land of rice and grain,
    The light of the Party warms our hearts.
    The ice and snow thaw, and the severe cold turns into spring!
    In the beautiful big garden of the motherland with its myriad colors,
    Your flower blooms so dazzlingly bright!
    Your hard work blossoms and bears fruit,
    And sings the poem of communism in the capital!

    “枯木逢春”观后
    孙维世
    余江县彻底消灭了血吸虫病的根源，
    敬爱的领袖在深夜里兴奋得不能入眠，
    他的心和祖国人民紧紧相连，
    写出了“送瘟神”伟大的诗篇！
    领袖的诗激动着人民的心弦，
    化为鲜明的形象在舞台上出现，
    演出了中国人民苦难的过去，
    歌唱了中国人民幸福的今天！
    鬼哭神号的土地上荒草弥漫，
    如今变成了锦绣山河米粮川，
    党的光芒照得我们心头暖。
    冰雪解冻，严寒化为春天！
    在祖国万紫千红美丽的大花园，
    你们这朵花开得这样夺目鲜艳！
    你们辛勤的劳动开花结果，
    在首都高唱了共产主义的诗篇！
