Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, March 25th: Under the leadership of the Party, Jishan County, Shanxi Province, is vigorously promoting the patriotic health campaign in coordination with production. The entire county is witnessing a moving scene of good health for everyone, cleanliness everywhere in urban and rural areas, thriving livestock breeding, and a completely new environment. It has established a red banner on the rural health front in our country.

This county has persistently and unremittingly carried out the health campaign for several years. Residents have developed hygienic habits, taking pride in hygiene and feeling ashamed of unhygienic conditions. The entire county is clean, everyone is healthy, and production has been greatly promoted. After the Ministry of Health held a national on-site rural health work conference here last November, the county put forward higher requirements, further mobilized the masses, and carried out basic construction in conjunction with the health campaign, achieving new brilliant achievements in the past few months. At present, key villages throughout the county are reforming residential lanes in a step-by-step manner, gradually rebuilding narrow and dirty streets into wide and flat roads, planting poplars and willows, and carrying out greening and beautification universally. More than 98% of the toilets that should be renovated throughout the county have been renovated, and the qualified rate after inspection is over 86%; various villages have improved compost pits, built new manure fermentation yards, and repaired dilapidated walls and broken houses, greatly improving environmental sanitation.

In the past few months, the county's health work has better coordinated with production and served production. The "Five To The Fields" system has been implemented throughout the county, meaning that doctors, health organizations, disease prevention and control, health education, and health facilities all go to the fields, ensuring the completion of agricultural production tasks. The county has also carried out rectification, consolidation, and improvement work for health care organizations. The county has also established a disease prevention and control professional team, formulated preventive medicines, and generally distributed them to the masses. The number of health care organizations in the county has increased from 70 management district health stations and joint health stations to 144, the number of outpatients has decreased by 35%, and the number of mobile medical treatments has increased by 47%. The county has also held nine medical training courses, and each commune has established health schools, training and improving more than 20,000 medical and health care personnel. In this way, the work of eliminating pests and diseases has been further strengthened.

Jishan County's health campaign has always been a mass movement under the leadership of the Party, achieving comprehensiveness, universality, depth, meticulousness, and regularity. From the county to the commune, management district, and production team, the secretary takes the lead, tightening control at every level, putting forward new content and new requirements in each period, and inspiring the masses to move forward. After the National Rural Health Work Jishan On-Site Conference, in order to prevent the masses from slackening their fighting spirit, the Jishan County Party Committee promptly put forward the call of "soldiers not removing their armor, horses not stopping their hooves, continuous revolution, and continuous improvement," leading the people of the county to further carry out the "Three Clearances" (clearing garbage, feces, and sewage) and "Ten Improvements" (improving toilets, livestock pens, pigsties, chicken coops, streets, wells, kitchens, sewage ditches, sewage pits, and ponds). After half a month of hard work by 300,000 people throughout the county, the tasks of "Three Clearances" and "Ten Improvements" were completed comprehensively and meticulously before the start of spring. At the arrival of spring, the county convened a spring health mobilization rally of 200,000 people, organized a thousand-person inspection team, and strived to complete the task of eliminating pests and diseases stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule this year.

In order to popularize health knowledge and raise the masses' awareness of hygiene, since last winter, the county has launched a massive publicity and education campaign to popularize national health knowledge in conjunction with the high tide of winter farmers' spare-time education. The county and commune established popular health knowledge committees and textbook writing teams, and each management district and production team established propaganda and education teams and groups to conduct a comprehensive survey, classify and organize classes, and train more than 26,000 propaganda and education backbones, cultivate more than 19,000 activists, and compile and print more than 150,000 copies of easy-to-understand health textbooks, setting off a high tide of health knowledge publicity and education of "thousands of people teaching, tens of thousands of people learning, tens of thousands of people teaching, and the whole people learning." Before the Spring Festival, among the 230,000 people aged ten to sixty in the county, 200,000 people understood the general health knowledge of preventing and treating more than 15 common diseases, and 15 villages initially popularized general health knowledge, and 38 villages basically popularized it.

Closely combining health work with production, and twisting health and production into one rope, is an important experience of Jishan County in carrying out the health campaign. Party committees at all levels in the county adopted the methods of "Five Unifications" (unified planning, unified deployment, unified inspection, unified reporting, unified evaluation) and "Five Combinations" (health combined with manure accumulation, health combined with livestock breeding, health combined with grain protection, health combined with greening, health combined with thrift and diligence in managing the household) to lead the health campaign, which not only did a good job in health but also did a good job in production. Because the people of the county pay attention to hygiene and are healthy, the labor attendance rate is often maintained above 95%, and the number of labor days per laborer per year is also constantly increasing. In recent months, Jishan County has combined the winter and spring manure accumulation campaigns to organize a professional army of more than 57,000 people, built more than 4,000 large public toilets and mobile toilets in garden-style and high-yield areas, cleared and improved more than 5,000 sealed sewage pits, and dug and dredged more than 21,000 drought wells and water cellars, while vigorously repairing streets and dilapidated houses, improving compost pits, and building new manure fermentation yards. In order to ensure the health of migrant workers in the winter and spring production campaigns, health stations were established at 13 water conservancy construction sites, and doctors and health workers were equipped for the "production corps" of 34 garden fields. Various "production corps" have also established sewing groups, laundry groups, foot washing pools, bathing ponds, and barber shops and other health facilities.

In carrying out health work, Jishan County pays attention to cultivating leap forward pacesetters to promote the continuous leap forward of health work. In the early stage of carrying out rural health work, the Jishan County Party Committee cultivated the health model village - Taiyang Village, so that everyone in the village developed the habit of paying attention to hygiene. After cultivating typical examples, it was immediately promoted in an all-round way, setting off a climax of "catching up with Taiyang Village" in the county. By 1959, more than 270 health model villages had emerged, forming a large area of health model areas. Since last winter, the county party committee has formulated a comprehensive leap forward pacesetter training program, putting forward the task of all-round development to 13 new key villages such as Taiyang and Xiwei; at the same time, it has put forward the requirement of improving the level to 41 general key villages in different regions. Under the demonstration influence of various key villages, a climax of you chasing me and catching up with each other has been set off everywhere. Among the 776 villages in the county, 568 villages have realized the "Taiyang Village-ization" of health care work. (Attached pictures)

    以移风易俗改造世界的伟大气概大搞卫生运动
    城乡处处清洁　人人身体健康
    ——农村卫生战线一面红旗
    委书记挂帅，层层抓紧；居民养成卫生习惯，以卫生为光荣，以不卫生为耻辱
    据新华社太原25日电　山西省稷山县在党的领导下，配合生产，大搞爱国卫生运动，全县出现了人人身体健康，城乡处处干净，六畜繁殖兴旺，环境焕然一新的动人景象，在我国农村卫生战线上树立起一面红旗。
    这个县几年来坚持不懈地大搞卫生运动，居民已经养成了卫生习惯，以卫生为光荣，以不卫生为耻辱，全县环境清洁，人人身体康健，大大促进了生产的发展。去年11月卫生部在这里召开过全国农村卫生工作现场会议后，全县提出了更高的要求，进一步发动群众，结合卫生运动大搞基本建设，几个月来又取得了新的辉煌成就。目前，全县各重点村有步骤地改革了居民巷，把窄狭肮脏的街道逐步改建成为宽阔平坦的马路，栽杨植柳，普遍进行了绿化和美化。全县厕所应整修的已有98％以上经过整修，经过检验合格率占86％以上；各村改良了堆肥坑，新建粪便发酵场，修整残墙破屋，大大改善了环境卫生。
    几个月来，全县卫生工作更好地配合生产，为生产服务，在全县范围内实行了五到田制度，即医生、保健组织、防治疾病、卫生教育、卫生设施都到田间，保证了农业生产任务的完成。全县还对卫生保健组织进行了整顿、巩固和提高的工作。县里又成立了防治疾病专业队，配制预防药品，普遍发给群众服用。全县保健组织由七十个管理区保健站和联合保健站增加到一百四十四个，门诊人数降低35％，巡回医疗的人数增长47％。县里还举办了九个医务训练班，各公社办起了卫生学校，共培训、提高了两万余名医疗保健人员。这样，进一步加强了除害灭病工作。
    稷山县开展卫生运动，一直是在党的领导下大搞群众运动，作到全面、普遍、深入、细致、经常。这个县从县到公社、管理区、生产队都是书记挂帅，层层抓紧，在每一个时期都提出新的内容，新的要求，鼓舞群众前进。在全国农村卫生工作稷山现场会议后，为了防止群众松懈斗志，中共稷山县委及时提出了“兵不卸甲，马不停蹄，不断革命，不断提高”的号召，领导全县人民进一步开展“三清除”（清除垃圾、粪便、污水）、“十改良”（改良厕所、畜圈、猪圈、鸡窝、街道、水井、厨房、污水沟、污水坑、池塘）的工作。全县三十万人经过半个月的奋战，在开春前就全面细致地完成了“三清除”、“十改良”的任务。在春季来临时，全县又召开了二十万人的春季卫生誓师动员大会，组织了千人检查团，力争在今年提前完成全国农业发展纲要所规定的除害灭病任务。
    为了普及卫生知识，提高群众讲卫生的自觉性，去年冬季以来，全县结合冬季农民业余教育的高潮，开展了声势浩大的普及全民卫生知识的宣传教育运动。县、社成立了普及卫生知识委员会和教材编写队，各管理区、生产队成立了宣教队、组，进行了全面摸底，划级编班，并以保健员、卫生员、宣传员、小学教员、教养员、助产员为主要对象，训练了二万六千余名宣教骨干，培养了一万九千余名积极分子，编印了通俗易懂的卫生教材十五万多份，掀起了“千人教，万人学，万人教，全民学”的卫生知识宣传教育高潮。到春节前，全县十岁至六十岁的二十三万余人中，已有二十万人懂得了防治十五种以上的常见疾病的一般卫生常识，并涌现出十五个普通卫生知识初步普及的村庄，三十八个基本普及的村庄。
    在卫生工作中密切结合生产，把卫生、生产拧成一股绳，是稷山县开展卫生运动的一条重要经验。全县各级党委采取“五统一”（统一计划、统一部署、统一检查、统一汇报、统一评比）、“五结合”（卫生结合积肥、卫生结合饲养牲畜、卫生结合保粮、卫生结合绿化、卫生结合勤俭持家）的办法，领导卫生运动，既搞好了卫生，又搞好了生产。全县人民由于讲卫生，身体健壮，劳动出勤率经常保持在95％以上，每个劳动力每年劳动日也不断增加。最近几个月来，稷山县结合冬季春季积肥运动，组织了五万七千余人的专业大军，在园田化与丰产方地区建起大型公共厕所和流动厕所四千多个，清除、改良了密封式污水坑五千多个，挖淘旱井、水窑二万一千多个，同时大力整修街道、破房，改良沤肥坑，新建粪便发酵场。为了保证冬、春季生产运动中民工的健康，在十三个水利工地，建立了卫生所，为三十四个园田方的“生产兵团”都配备了医生、保健员。各个“生产兵团”还建立了缝纫组、洗衣组、洗脚池、洗澡塘和理发室等卫生设施。
    稷山县开展卫生工作当中，注意培养跃进标兵，推动卫生工作不断向前跃进。在开展农村卫生工作的早期，中共稷山县委就培养了卫生模范村——太阳村，使这个村人人养成讲卫生的习惯。培养典型后，便立即全面推广，在全县掀起了一个“赶太阳村”的高潮。到1959年，已出现了二百七十多个卫生模范村，形成了大面积的卫生模范地区。去年冬季以来，县委又拟定了全面跃进标兵的培养方案，向太阳、西位等十三个新型重点村，提出了全面发展的任务；同时，又向不同地区的四十一个一般重点村，提出了提高水平的要求。在各重点村的示范影响下，各地掀起你追我赶的高潮，全县七百七十六个村中，已有五百六十八个村庄实现了卫生保健工作“太阳村化”。（附图片）
