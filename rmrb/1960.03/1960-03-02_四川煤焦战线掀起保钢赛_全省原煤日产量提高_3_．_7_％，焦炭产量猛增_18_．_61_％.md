    Sichuan Coal and Coke Front Launches Steel Protection Campaign
    Provincial Raw Coal Daily Output Increases by 3.7%, Coke Production Surges by 18.61%
    (Our Newspaper News) The coal and coke front in Sichuan Province is carrying out a large-scale competition movement, striving to protect iron and steel.
    After the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee held a telephone conference on February 15, Tianfu Coal Mine took the lead, proposing that all coal mines in the province launch a friendly competition. Subsequently, Yida Coal Mine, Jiayang Coal Mine, Huayin Coal Mine, Rongchang Coal Mine, Zengjiashan Coal Mine, Zhongliangshan Coal Mine, and Qijiang Tongxing Coal Mine immediately responded. In addition to responding to Tianfu Coal Mine, Qijiang Tongxing Coal Mine also challenged Zhongliangshan Coal Mine and Weiyuan Coal Mine. While responding to Tianfu Coal Mine, Yida Coal Mine also challenged Jiangbei Coal Mine, Shuanghe Coal Mine, Guangyuan Coal Mine, Dashibao Coal Mine, and Tianchi Coal Mine. In this way, a heated situation of small mines catching up with large mines and backward mines catching up with advanced mines quickly emerged throughout the province. In order to promote the in-depth development of this steel protection competition movement, the Provincial Coal Department and the Provincial Coal Industry Union jointly held a telephone conference attended by the directors of coal industry bureaus of various special districts and cities, promoting the rapid formation of a surge in competition among various regions.
    After the competition was launched, all employees were enthusiastic and forged ahead bravely; leading cadres went deep into the front line to direct production. The Minister of the Industry and Transportation Department of the Leshan Prefectural Committee went deep into Mojian Coal Mine; discovered the weak link of fewer miners working underground, immediately transferred more miners to enrich the underground, and strengthened the scheduling of underground vehicles, so that the daily output of raw coal in the entire mine quickly increased from more than 1,700 tons to 2,200 tons. The coal management bureau of this special district also adopted the method of the bureau guaranteeing the mine, the mine guaranteeing the well, and the well guaranteeing the team, sending cadres at all levels to strengthen leadership. More than 80% of the cadres in each mine fought side by side with the workers, so the output of raw coal and the amount of coke charged into the kiln in the entire district increased sharply by 26.29% and 20.81% respectively in the first five days of the competition. In the Chongqing area, in order to better supply coal for iron and steel production, Tianfu, Nantong, Yutianpu, Zhongliangshan, and Qingnian coal mines sent employee representatives to deliver guarantee conditions to Sanjiang Steel Plant, Beibei Steel Plant, and Xin Jiezhi Iron Plant, respectively, to achieve the purpose of mutual guarantee and mutual promotion through this activity.
    In the competition movement, coal mine workers in various places, in response to the weak links in production, carried out large-scale technological innovation and technological revolution, vigorously promoted advanced experiences, and promoted the rapid improvement of production levels. The workers of the 16th coal mining team of the third mine of Tianfu Coal Mine boldly innovated coal mining technology and implemented the "single straight-line longwall" advanced coal mining method. Compared with before the implementation, the output increased sharply by 80%, reduced five processes, saved 22% of labor, and saved 30% of pit wood, while ensuring safe production. Yutianpu Coal Mine launched a technical performance with 10,000 people, realizing major technological innovations such as coal mining production linkage line, steel saw coal cutting, wide-face excavation, and long-distance centralized control of mechanical and electrical equipment, and comprehensively promoted four-eight cross-operations, which effectively promoted the rapid improvement of production.
    Through the competition, the province's coal and coke production increased rapidly. From February 17 to 22, the average daily output of raw coal increased by 3.7% compared with February 1 to 16, and the output of coke increased sharply by 18.61%.

    四川煤焦战线掀起保钢赛
    全省原煤日产量提高3．7％，焦炭产量猛增18．61％
    本报讯　四川省煤焦战线全体职工大搞竞赛运动，奋力保铁保钢。
    中共四川省委在2月15日召开电话会议以后，天府煤矿就一马当先，倡议全省各煤矿展开友谊竞赛。接着，义大煤矿、嘉阳煤矿、华银煤矿、荣昌煤矿、曾家山煤矿、中梁山煤矿、綦江同兴煤矿立即响应。綦江同兴煤矿除向天府煤矿应战外，并向中梁山煤矿、威远煤矿挑战。义大煤矿也在向天府煤矿应战的同时，向江北煤矿、双河煤矿、广元煤矿、大石堡煤矿、天池煤矿挑战。这样，在全省范围内，很快就出现了小矿赶大矿，后进赶先进的热烈局面。为了促进这一保钢竞赛运动深入开展，省煤炭厅和省煤炭工会还联合召开了有各专区、市煤炭工业局局长参加的电话会议，推动各地区之间的竞赛很快形成热潮。
    竞赛展开以后，全体职工干劲冲天，勇往直前；领导干部深入第一线，指挥生产。乐山地委工业交通部部长深入沫江煤矿；发现了井下挖工少这一薄弱环节，立即增调挖工充实井下，同时加强了井下车辆调度工作，使全矿原煤日产量迅速由一千七百多吨增加到二千二百吨。这个专区的煤管局还采取了局保矿、矿保井、井保小组的办法，层层派干部加强领导，各矿又组织了80％以上的干部同工人并肩奋战，因而全区在竞赛开始的五天中，原煤产量和焦炭装窑量就比以前猛增26．29％和20 ．81％。在重庆地区，为了更好地供应钢铁生产用煤，天府、南桐、鱼田堡、中梁山、青年等煤矿，派出职工代表，把保证条件分别送到三江钢铁厂、北碚钢铁厂、新街子铁厂，通过这种活动达到互相保证、互相促进的目的。
    在竞赛运动中，各地煤矿职工针对生产中的薄弱环节，大搞技术革新和技术革命，大力推广先进经验，促进了生产水平的迅速提高。天府煤矿三井采煤十六组的工人，大胆革新采煤技术，推行了“单一直线长壁式”先进采煤法，与推行前相比，产量猛增80％，减少了五道工序，节约劳动力22％，节约坑木30％，同时保证了安全生产。鱼田堡煤矿万人齐上阵，开展技术大表演，实现了采煤生产联动线、钢锯割煤、宽面掘进、机电设备远距离集中控制等重大技术革新，全面推行四八交叉作业，有力地推动生产迅速提高。
    通过竞赛，全省煤、焦产量迅速上升。2月17日至22日，原煤平均日产量较2月1日至16日提高了3 ．7％，焦炭产量猛增18．61％。
