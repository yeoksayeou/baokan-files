Xinhua News Agency dispatches: According to reports, the Argentine government, based on the promulgated "emergency measures," recently conducted large-scale searches and arrests in the capital Buenos Aires and provinces such as Cordoba and Mendoza. On March 16th alone, the search in Buenos Aires involved more than 1,000 military police. According to a United Press International report on the 17th, the number of people arrested in the past twenty-four hours totaled four hundred. "La Razón" reported that the searches focused on Peronists and allies of the Communists, and the city of Rosario, where many workers live, has been declared a "war zone." The news said that the hundreds of people recently arrested included some important trade union leaders.

The Communist Party of Argentina, the Socialist Party, the Peronist Party's Buenos Aires Province organization, the Cordoba Province General Confederation of Labor, and other groups have recently issued statements condemning the authorities' declaration of a "state of emergency" and the large-scale searches and arrests.

The Communist Party of Argentina's statement said: "The president, under the direct pressure of reactionary groups in the armed forces, has implemented the Conintes Plan (state of civil war) under the pretext of suppressing terrorist activities."

The statement pointed out: "The remaining democracy in Argentina is being further undermined, all of which is paving the way for the establishment of a reactionary dictatorship."

The statement also condemned terrorist activities.

The statement concluded by calling on all political forces to unite and save Argentina from the disasters caused by the implementation of the International Monetary Fund's plan.

    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：阿根廷政府根据颁布的“紧急措施”，最近在首都布宜诺斯艾利斯和科尔多瓦、门多萨等省进行了大规模的搜捕。单是16日在布宜诺斯艾利斯的搜捕中，就出动了军警一千余人。据合众国际社17日报道，在过去二十四小时内被捕人数共达四百人。“理性报”报道说，搜捕集中于庇隆主义者和共产党人的同盟者，大量工人集中居住的罗萨利俄城已被宣布为“战争地区”。消息说，在最近被捕的数百人中间包括一些重要的工会领导人。
    阿根廷共产党、社会党，庇隆主义党布宜诺斯艾利斯省组织、科尔多瓦省总工会以及其他一些团体最近都发表声明，谴责当局宣布“紧急状态”和进行大规模搜捕。
    阿根廷共产党的声明说：“总统在武装部队中的反动集团的直接压力下，借口镇压恐怖活动而实行了科宁特斯计划（内战状态）。”
    声明指出：阿根廷现在残存的民主进一步遭到破坏，这一切都是
  “为建立反动的独裁政权铺平道路”。
    声明还谴责了恐怖活动。
    声明最后要求一切政治力量团结起来，把阿根廷从执行国际货币基金组织的计划而引起的灾难中拯救出来。
