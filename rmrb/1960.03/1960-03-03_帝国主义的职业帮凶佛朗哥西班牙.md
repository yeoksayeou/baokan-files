Franco's Spain is preparing to provide military bases for the West German Bundeswehr, a matter that cannot but draw the attention of all peace-loving people.

Franco's regime was originally fostered by Hitler's Germany. For more than twenty years, this fascist regime has been colluding with the world's most reactionary forces to endanger world peace. Franco served as an accomplice of Nazi Germany during World War II. After the war, he sold Spain to American imperialism, obsequiously serving America's aggressive war policy. Now he is about to collude with ambitious West German militarists.

As early as before the overthrow of the Spanish dynasty in 1931, Franco served as the colonial military governor of Spanish Morocco. At that time, his means of suppressing the colonial people were extremely cruel, hence he gained the nickname "Butcher." Later, the Spanish people's revolutionary uprising overthrew the reactionary dynasty and established the Spanish Republic. The Spanish regime was in the hands of the Popular Front, including the Communist Party. The world's anti-communist forces were determined to subvert the Spanish Republic, and they took a fancy to Franco as a tool. Franco, with the instigation and support of German and Italian fascists, organized a rebel army and launched a civil war. In fact, this was also the prelude to Hitler's launch of World War II. At that time, the United States, Britain, and France, under the guise of so-called "non-interference," prevented the Spanish Republic from obtaining foreign aid, allowing Germany to intervene militarily. Finally, in 1939, Franco relied on Hitler's guns and bayonets to slaughter a million outstanding Spanish sons and daughters, establishing his dictatorship in a pool of blood.

In order to repay his master Hitler, Franco's Spain placed Spain's economic and military power under German control as a base for Nazi German military and espionage activities. He also sent the "Blue Division" to cooperate with Hitler's army in attacking the Soviet Union.

After World War II, Franco, under the aegis of the United States, once again became the vanguard of the world's anti-communist forces. The Nazi forces were preserved for new purposes, and Franco's Spain became a haven for German fascist bacteria. Since the war, thousands of war criminals have found refuge in Spain. Franco's army accommodated more than 50,000 Nazi soldiers to "pass on experience." Soldiers who had served in the "Blue Division" celebrated the "seventeenth anniversary of going to the Soviet front" in 1958. And the West German monopoly capital that used to manufacture munitions for Hitler is now re-manufacturing various weapons in Spain. The gun king Krupp is even preparing to mine uranium in Spain. No wonder West German Foreign Minister Brentano said during his visit to Spain a few years ago: the traditional friendly relations between the two countries in political, commercial and cultural fields have been reaffirmed and strengthened.

In order to achieve its sinister goals, the United States has been obstructing the condemnation and punishment of Franco by the people of all countries. U.S. Senator Henry once said: "Spain has been fighting communism since 1936, and every country that fights communism is our friend." At that time, U.S. House of Representatives Military Committee Chairman Short said during his visit to Spain: "If the plan to revive Europe is for the struggle against communism, then there is no better place than Spain to fight against communism." In 1953, the United States signed a military agreement with Spain, turning Spain into an important military base in Western Europe. These American military bases helped the United States transport troops and munitions to militarily intervene in Lebanon. The American troops also helped the Franco government suppress the resistance of the Spanish people. Now the United States is building atomic bomber bases in Spain and is actively preparing to build missile bases in the Pyrenees, which are "of special use in the event of a conflict with Russia." In the five years after the signing of the US-Spanish military agreement, the United States also gave Franco 1.2 billion US dollars in "aid" to "modernize" his army. All of this has tied Spain tightly to the American war chariot.

Franco's repayment to his new master is even more meticulous. He not only offered Spain's territory with both hands; allowing American goods to enter Spain duty-free, enabling American capital to control Spain's main industrial sectors, but also asked the Spanish people to shed their blood and everything. Franco himself once said: "We can give the United States everything we can give." Franco's newspaper also shamelessly wrote: "We need American flour, oil, and cannons. The United States needs us even more. One day...the United States will also need our blood." Sure enough, Franco, like flattering Hitler, guaranteed to the United States during the Korean War that he could provide one million people to help the United States invade Korea. In order to make Spain a thorough slave of American imperialism, Franco turned Spain into a large prison, using bloody means to suppress all those who resisted Franco's policy of selling out national interests.

Now, for the sake of anti-communism, anti-people, and preparation for a new war of aggression, the most vicious enemy of world peace, American imperialism, German militarism which launched two world wars, and the reactionary fascist regime in Western Europe, these three evil spirits have openly colluded again. However, the people of all countries will never allow history to repeat itself.

    帝国主义的职业帮凶佛朗哥西班牙
    佛朗哥西班牙正在准备为西德国防军提供军事基地，这件事情不能不引起一切爱好和平的人们的注意。
    佛朗哥的政权原是希特勒德国一手扶植起来的。这个法西斯政权二十多年来一直跟世界最反动的势力沆瀣一气，来危害世界和平。佛朗哥在第二次世界大战中曾经充当过法西斯德国的帮凶，战后他又把西班牙出卖给美帝国主义，奴颜婢膝地为美国的侵略战争政策效劳。现在他又要同野心勃勃的西德军国主义分子勾结在一起。
    佛朗哥早在1931年西班牙王朝被推翻前，就充任西属摩洛哥的殖民地军事长官。当时他镇压殖民地人民的手段极其残酷故获得了“屠夫”的称号。后来西班牙人民革命起义推翻了反动王朝，建立了西班牙共和国，西班牙政权掌握在包括共产党在内的人民阵线的手中。世界反共势力一心要颠复西班牙共和国，他们看中了佛朗哥这个工具。佛朗哥就在德国和意大利法西斯的怂恿和支持下，组织叛军发动了内战。实际上这也是希特勒发动第二次世界大战的序幕。当时美、英、法以所谓“不干涉”为名，阻止西班牙共和国获得外力支援，听任德国武装干涉。终于在1939年佛朗哥依靠了希特勒的枪炮和刺刀屠杀了一百万西班牙优秀儿女，在血泊中建立起他的独裁统治。
    佛朗哥西班牙为了报答他的主子希特勒，把西班牙的经济、军事大权置于德国的控制之下作为纳粹德国军事和间谍活动的基地。他并且派遣了“蓝色师团”去配合希特勒军队攻打苏联。
    第二次世界大战之后，佛朗哥一直在美国的卵翼下重新充当世界反共势力的急先锋。纳粹势力被保存下来作新的用途，佛朗哥西班牙也就变成了德国法西斯细菌的庇护所。战后以来，成千的战犯在西班牙找到了藏身之地。佛朗哥的军队里收容了五万多名纳粹士兵在“传授经验”。曾在“蓝色师团”服役的士兵在1958年还庆祝“开往苏联火线十七周年”。而过去为希特勒制造军火的西德垄断资本今天也在西班牙重新制造各种武器。枪炮大王克虏伯更准备开采西班牙的铀矿。无怪乎前几年西德外长勃伦塔诺访问西班牙时说：两国在政治、商业、文化方面的传统友好关系已重新肯定和加强。
    美国为了实现它的罪恶目的，一直阻挠各国人民对佛朗哥的谴责和惩罚。美国参议员亨利曾这样说过：“西班牙自从1936年以来就一直与共产主义斗争着，而每一个与共产主义斗争的国家都是我们的朋友。”当时美国众议院军事委员会主席萧尔特在访问西班牙时也说：“如果制定复兴欧洲的计划是为了对共产主义的斗争，那末就没有比西班牙更好的地方可以同共产主义进行斗争的了”。1953年美国同西班牙订立了军事协定，美国把西班牙变成了它在西欧重要的军事基地。美国的这些军事基地帮助了美国运兵和军火去武装干涉黎巴嫩。美国的驻军也帮助佛朗哥政府镇压西班牙人民的反抗。现在美国又在西班牙修建了原子轰炸机基地，并积极准备在“同俄国发生冲突时有特别用途”的比利牛斯山建立导弹基地。在美西军事协定签订后五年中，美国还给了佛朗哥十二亿美元的“援助”，使他的军队“现代化”。这一切使得西班牙紧紧地被绑在美国的战车上。
    佛朗哥报答他的新主人更是无微不至。他不但双手奉献了西班牙的领土；让美国商品免税进入西班牙，使美国资本控制西班牙的主要工业部门，同时还要西班牙人民献出鲜血和一切。佛朗哥自己就曾经说过：“我们可以把我们一切所能给的都给美国。”佛朗哥的报纸也无耻地写着：“我们需要美国的面粉、石油及大炮，美国更多地需要我们。有一天……美国还需要我们的鲜血。”果然佛朗哥又像向希特勒献媚一样，在朝鲜战争时期佛朗哥又向美国保证可以提供一百万人去帮助美国侵略朝鲜。为了使西班牙彻底成为美帝的奴仆，佛朗哥把西班牙变成一座大监狱，用尽血腥手段镇压一切反抗佛朗哥出卖民族利益政策的人。
    现在，为了反共反人民、准备新的侵略战争，世界和平的最凶恶敌人美帝国主义、发动两次世界大战的德国军国主义和西欧反动的法西斯政权这三个凶神恶煞又公开串同在一起。但是，各国人民决不允许历史重演。
