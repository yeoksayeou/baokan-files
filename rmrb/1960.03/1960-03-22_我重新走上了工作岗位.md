    I Returned to My Work Post

    I have three children, the oldest is seven and the youngest is just over a year old. The three children kept me so busy I couldn't even leave the house. After the Great Leap Forward, I sent the children to nurseries and became a childcare worker in a nearby kindergarten. I was so happy teaching the children to sing and dance every day. But the problem was, after work, I still had to busy myself with washing rice and vegetables. Sometimes when my partner came home and couldn't eat on time, he was very unhappy. Therefore, I only worked for half a month and had to quit.

    Recently, a large courtyard canteen was established in our courtyard. With this canteen, I no longer have to deal with firewood, rice, oil, and salt. Every day after work, as soon as I enter the canteen, the cooks bring us hot meals. Everyone eats together in a lively and cheerful atmosphere, chatting and laughing, before going off to work or school. My partner and I no longer quarrel, and the children's appetites have increased and they are becoming stronger. In the evening, after I settle the children to sleep, I even have spare time to study politics and culture!

    我重新走上了工作岗位
    我有三个孩子，大的七岁，最小的一岁多。三个孩子缠得我连家门都走不出去。大跃进后，我把孩子送进了托儿所，并到附近的幼儿园当保育员。每天教孩子们唱歌跳舞，我真高兴极了。可是，伤脑子的是，下班后我还得忙着淘米洗菜。有时爱人回来，没能按时吃饭，他很不高兴。因此，我仅仅工作了半个月，就只好不干了。
    最近我们院子里成立了大院食堂啦，有了这食堂，我再也不和柴、米、油、盐打交道了。每天下班后，一进食堂，炊事员就给我们端来热呼呼的饭菜。大家热热闹闹，有说有笑地吃完饭后，就上班的去上班，上学的去上学。我们夫妻俩再也不闹别扭，孩子们饭量增加，身体越发结实了。晚上，我安置孩子们睡着了，还有富余时间学习政治和文化哩！
