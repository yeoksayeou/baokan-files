    The First Year of the Six-Year Plan
    By our correspondent Wei Lingbing
    Comrade Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej said at the Romanian Workers' Party Central Committee plenum in July 1959: "A bright prospect of basically completing socialist construction and transitioning to the completion of socialist construction is presented to our people."
    It is precisely this great goal that inspires the Romanian working people, enabling them to achieve brilliant successes in socialist construction in 1959. Now, the Romanian people, with the joy of victory and firm confidence, are entering a new stage of socialist construction—the first year of the Six-Year Plan.
    The tremendous achievements made by the Romanian working people in the past few years, especially last year, have created favorable conditions for the comprehensive development of the national economy this year. The main tasks of the Romanian 1960 National Plan are: to concentrate material and financial resources, rapidly increase industrial and agricultural production, improve labor productivity, reduce production costs in all economic sectors, and continuously improve the material and cultural living standards of urban and rural working people. The high-speed development of the entire national economy and its major sectors this year is the main characteristic of the 1960 National Plan. This year, industrial production will increase by 14% compared to 1959, which is the fastest rate of development in the last six years. This year, the iron and steel industry will continue to develop at a high speed, and steel production will increase by another 22% compared to the unprecedentedly developed 1959, reaching 1.7 million tons. This figure is 740,000 tons more than the total steel production of Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Turkey in 1958.
    The production of the machine-building industry will leap forward along with the iron and steel industry. According to the plan, this year it will increase by 17% compared to last year. Before liberation, almost all the machinery and equipment used in Romania relied on imports, but this year, the total value of machinery and equipment exports will rank second among all export products.
    In the past decade, the uniquely endowed Romanian chemical industry has grown at an average annual rate of 23%, and this year it will increase by 22% compared to last year. A series of large-scale, modernly equipped chemical plants will be built now and in the coming years, and these plants will guarantee the high development of the chemical industry.
    This year, the power industry will excellently overfulfill the tasks stipulated in the "Ten-Year Electrification Plan." It is expected that 7.7 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity can be produced this year, which is 10% more than the original plan. The timber processing industry, which has a long history, has developed rapidly in recent years. This year, the production of wood chipboard will double, and various types of furniture will increase by 31%.
    While increasing industrial production, large-scale capital construction will be carried out this year. There are 400 projects above the quota this year. Currently, two blast furnaces with a capacity of 700 cubic meters each are being built in the steel cities of Hunedoara and Reșița, as well as a national-scale open-hearth furnace and a set of coke ovens; petrochemical bases are being established in Borzești and other places; and a large-scale wood processing complex is being built in the Craiova region. In addition, many furniture factories, sugar factories, textile factories, and fiber factories will be built this year.
    This year, the tasks of Romanian agricultural workers are: to take all measures to continue to increase the yield per unit area of grain crops and economic crops, expand the planting area of silage corn, and greatly develop animal husbandry. This year, the entire agricultural production will increase by 13% on the basis of last year's bumper harvest, of which livestock products will increase by more than 20%.
    This year, investment in agriculture has increased by 25% compared to last year. These investments will be used to improve the mechanization of agriculture, increase chemical fertilizers, and carry out large-scale soil improvement work. The agricultural sector will receive 30,000 tractors, seeders, and combine harvesters this year. Another favorable condition for ensuring the comprehensive development of agriculture this year is the rapid development of socialist agricultural cooperative organizations. So far, 75% of the farmers in the country have joined collective farms and mutual aid teams. In the past two months, state farms and collective farms across the country have summarized their experience in achieving high yields last year and formulated production plans and high-yield measures for this year. Flood control, drainage, and water conservancy work will be carried out on 210,000 hectares of land this year, and more than 30 million tons of organic fertilizer will be applied. The collective farmers of Bucharest County decided to increase the average yield of wheat per hectare to 1,800 kilograms and corn to 2,500 kilograms.
    The Romanian Workers' Party Central Committee meeting in December last year put forward the task of rapidly developing animal husbandry to the agricultural sector, especially to increase the production of meat and milk and the number of fine-wool sheep. This year, the total number of pigs, cattle, and sheep in the country will increase by 6.5% compared to last year. In order to develop animal husbandry, an important measure taken this year is to expand the planting area of silage corn to 250,000 hectares, an increase of 136% compared to last year. The agricultural and livestock production of state farms will have greater development this year, and the entire production is expected to increase by 51% compared to last year.
    The Romanian working people are determined to overfulfill the 1960 National Economic Development Plan. They have put forward many guarantees regarding increasing production and practicing economy. In the past two months, good results have been achieved in many departments.
    Steelworkers have launched a new production competition campaign from the first day of this year. Steelworkers in Hunedoara County guarantee to produce 100,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of iron above the plan this year. They have already produced more than 20,000 tons of steel and iron above the plan in January and February. Other steel enterprises have also produced many metallurgical products above the plan. Steelworkers can achieve such good results mainly because they have improved equipment utilization. The No. 2 open-hearth furnace of the Hunedoara Metallurgical Complex can produce 35,000 tons more steel each year simply by reducing furnace repair time and improving charging methods. Steelworkers have received enthusiastic support from the broad masses of the people across the country. Recently, a campaign to collect scrap metal has been launched nationwide. Currently, the people of Romania are actively participating in this patriotic movement, especially the urban and rural youth are more active. Many places have held scrap iron collection weeks or days. Railway workers in Simeria wrote a letter to the steelworkers in Hunedoara, guaranteeing to intercept 63 abandoned carriages this year. Coal miners in Lunca also agreed to the steelworkers' request to guarantee the supply of scrap iron and have selected 66 tons of scrap iron. Residents in urban and rural areas of Ploiești County collected 15,000 tons of scrap metal in two months.
    Coal miners have also achieved great achievements in the production competition campaign. Coal miners in the Jiu Valley coal mining area have already mined 24,000 tons of coal above the plan in January and February. Oil drilling workers have greatly increased the drilling speed after promoting turbine drilling. The drilling team in Țergu-Jiu drilled 1,900 meters more in February than originally planned.
    This year, a common issue of concern for Romanian industrial enterprises is to improve equipment utilization and save raw materials. In order to achieve these goals, a production technology innovation movement has been launched nationwide. Currently, the majority of workers are participating in this movement. 25% of the workers in the "Telman" tractor factory have become innovation proposers. The workers of the "Mao Zedong" factory put forward 120 suggestions for improving the production process, which can increase the machine utilization rate by 6% compared to the original plan.
    This year, the Romanian working people plan to save 5.2 billion lei (Romanian currency) for the country. In order to complete this huge task, various factories and enterprises are trying every means to save raw materials and reduce production costs. The workers of the "May 1st" oil equipment factory put forward the slogan "Do not waste a single lei, effectively use every lei." The workers of the shoe factory in Timișoara County put forward the initiative that each leather cutting worker should save four square meters of leather per month.
    Romanian construction workers are carrying out various capital construction projects at high speed. Construction workers at the Iași furniture factory site continue to work even on rainy days. They want to put this factory, which produces 10,000 sets of furniture annually, into production several months ahead of schedule.
    On the agricultural front, large-scale spring plowing work is about to begin. Tens of thousands of tractors and seeders have long been overhauled. In order to strive for a greater harvest this year, farmers in various places braved the severe cold to transport large amounts of natural fertilizer and chemical fertilizer to the fields. The seed selection work has also ended on time. In the past winter and spring, 560,000 people in rural areas across the country participated in agricultural technology lectures. Flood control, drainage, and water conservancy work has already begun on 109 construction sites. As in last year, most of these projects will be completed through farmers' voluntary labor.

    六年计划的第一年
    本报记者　魏凌冰
    乔治乌—德治同志在罗马尼亚工人党1959年7月中央全会上说：“在我国人民面前展示了基本上结束社会主义建设和过渡到完成社会主义建设的光辉前景。”
    正是这个伟大目标鼓舞着罗马尼亚劳动人民，使他们在1959年的社会主义建设中取得了辉煌的成就。现在，罗马尼亚人民怀着胜利的喜悦和坚强的信心，进入了社会主义建设的一个新阶段——六年计划的第一年。
    罗马尼亚劳动人民在过去几年，特别是在去年所取得的巨大成就，为今年国民经济的全面发展创造了良好的条件。罗马尼亚1960年国家计划的主要任务是：集中物力财力，迅速增加工农业生产，提高劳动生产率，降低一切经济部门的生产成本，不断改进城乡劳动人民的物质和文化生活水平。今年将高速度地发展整个国民经济和其中的主要部门，这是1960年国家计划的主要特点。今年的工业生产将比1959年增长14％，这是最近六年来的最快的发展速度。今年，继续以高速度发展钢铁工业，钢的生产将比获得空前发展的1959年再增长22％，也就是达到一百七十万吨。这个数字比丹麦、芬兰、挪威和土耳其四个国家1958年钢产量的总和还多七十四万吨。
    机器制造工业的生产将随着钢铁工业向前跃进。按照计划，今年将比去年增长17％。在解放前，罗马尼亚使用的机器设备几乎全靠进口，但在今年，机器设备的出口总值将在各种出口产品中跃居第二位。
    最近十年来，得天独厚的罗马尼亚化学工业，平均每年增长23％，今年将比去年增长22％。现在和今后几年要建设一系列规模宏大、设备现代化的化学工厂，这些工厂将保证化学工业的高度发展。
    今年电力工业将出色地超额完成“十年电气化计划”所规定的任务。预计今年可生产七十七亿度电，也就是将超过原计划10％。具有悠久历史的木材加工工业最近几年来发展很快。今年，木屑压制板的产量将增加一倍，各种家具增加31％。
    在增加工业生产的同时，今年将进行大规模的基本建设。今年限额以上的工程有四百项。目前，在钢铁城市洪尼多阿拉和累希擦正在修建两座各为七百立方米的高炉，一座全国最大的平炉和一组炼焦炉；在博尔泽斯蒂等地建立石油化学基地；在克拉约瓦州修建一个大型的木材加工联合企业。另外，今年还要修建许多家具厂、制糖厂、纺织厂、纤维厂等。
    今年，罗马尼亚农业劳动者的任务是：采取一切措施，继续提高粮食作物和经济作物的单位面积产量，扩大青贮玉蜀黍的播种面积，大大发展畜牧业。今年整个农业生产将在去年大丰收的基础上增长13％，其中畜产品将增长20％以上。
    今年对农业的投资比去年增加了25％。这些投资将用来提高农业的机械化程度，增加化学肥料和进行大规模的土壤改良工作。农业部门今年将得到三万台拖拉机、播种机和联合收割机。保证农业在今年获得全面发展的另一个有利条件，是社会主义农业合作组织的迅速发展。到目前为止，全国75％的农户已经加入了集体农庄和共耕社。在最近两个多月来，全国的国营农场和集体农庄都总结了去年的丰产经验，订出了今年的生产计划和丰产措施。今年将在二十一万公顷土地上进行防洪、排涝和兴修水利的工作，并施用三千多万吨有机肥料。布加勒斯特州的集体农民决定使每公顷小麦的平均产量增加到一千八百公斤，玉蜀黍二千五百公斤。
    罗马尼亚工人党去年十二月中央全会向农业部门提出了迅速发展畜牧业的任务，特别是要增加肉类、奶类的产量和细毛羊的头数。今年全国猪、牛、羊的总头数将比去年增加6．5％。为了发展畜牧业，今年采取的一项重要措施是把青贮玉蜀黍的播种面积扩大到二十五万公顷，比去年增加136％。国营农场的农牧业生产今年将有更大发展，预计整个生产将比去年增长51％。
    罗马尼亚劳动人民决心超额完成1960年的国民经济发展计划。他们提出了许多关于增产节约的保证。最近两个月来，在许多部门中已经取得了很好的成绩。
    钢铁工人从今年的第一天起就展开了新的生产竞赛运动。洪尼多阿拉州的钢铁工人保证今年超计划生产十万吨钢和两万吨铁。他们在1、2月份已经超计划生产了两万多吨钢铁。其他钢铁企业也超计划生产了许多冶金产品，钢铁工人能取得这样好的成就，主要是因为提高了设备利用率。洪尼多阿拉冶金联合企业的二号平炉单是由于减少修炉时间和改进装料方法，每年就能多生产三万五千吨钢。钢铁工人得到了全国广大人民的热烈支援。最近，在全国范围内展开了收集废金属的运动。目前罗马尼亚全国人民都积极投入了这个爱国运动，特别是城乡的青少年更为积极。许多地方都举行了收集废铁周或日。西梅里亚铁路工人给洪尼多阿拉炼钢工人写了信，保证在今年内截断六十三个废车厢。隆尼亚的煤矿工人也答应了炼钢工人的要求，保证供应废铁，并已选出了六十六吨废铁。普罗什蒂州的城乡居民在两个月中就收集了一万五千吨废金属。
    采煤工人在生产竞赛运动中也取得了很大成就。日乌河谷煤矿区的工人在1、2月份已经超计划采煤两万四千吨。石油钻井工人在推广涡轮钻井后，钻井速度大大提高。德尔古—日乌的钻井队在2月份比原计划多钻了一千九百米。
    今年罗马尼亚工业企业普遍注意的问题是提高设备利用率和节约原材料。为了实现这些目的，在全国开展了生产技术革新运动，目前，广大工人都参加了这个运动。“台尔曼”拖拉机工厂已有25％的工人成了革新建议者。“毛泽东”工厂的工人提出了一百二十项改进生产过程的建议，可以使机器利用率比原计划提高6％。
    罗马尼亚劳动人民今年计划为国家节约五十二亿列伊（罗币）。为完成这个巨大任务，各个工厂企业都千方百计节约原材料，降低生产成本。“五一”石油设备工厂的工人提出了“不浪费一个列伊，有效地使用每个列伊”的口号。底密索拉州制鞋厂的工人提出了每个裁皮工人每月节约四平方米皮子的倡议。
    罗马尼亚建筑工人们正在以高速度进行着各项基本建设工程。雅西家具厂工地的建筑工人即使在下雨天也继续工作。他们要使这个年产一万套家具的工厂提前数个月投入生产。
    在农业战线上，大规模的春耕工作即将展开。成万台的拖拉机、播种机早已检修完毕。为了争取在今年获得更大丰收，各地农民冒着严寒向地里运送了大量的天然肥料和化学肥料。选种工作也按时结束了。在去冬今春，全国农村中有五十六万人参加了农业技术讲座。防洪、排涝和兴修水利的工作已经在一百零九个工地上开始了。和去年一样，这些工程大多数都将通过农民进行义务劳动来完成。（附图片）
