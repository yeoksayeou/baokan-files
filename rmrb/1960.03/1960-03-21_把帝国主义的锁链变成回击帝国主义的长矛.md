Turn the Chains of Imperialism into Spears to Strike Back Against Imperialism
Chile, José Venturelli

    The establishment of the China-Latin America Friendship Association opens a new page in the relations between the Chinese people and the people of Latin America. Friendship will deeply penetrate the hearts of all Latin Americans who are good at discerning the sincere friendship of the Chinese people's brotherly unity.
    Some people think that Latin Americans do not treat their guests with courtesy, and others think that we do not understand what friendly relations are. Two years ago, a vice president was spurned and had to leave ignominiously the country he was "visiting." Not long ago, a president, under the banner of "friendship," "visited" four Latin American countries, but his "visit" was conducted under heavy guard. This gives people the obvious impression that he was not visiting friends, but meeting his enemies. In fact, Latin Americans understand the meaning of the word friendship very well, and because they understand its content, they are good at distinguishing who are their friends and who are not. The imperialists who enslave them economically, politically, and culturally cannot expect to be sympathized with, but only to be spurned. While U.S. imperialism is dropping incendiary bombs on Cuban sugarcane plantations or attempting to carry out sabotage by spreading death and destruction among the people, it cannot deceive anyone with a smile. While singing "equality," "respect," and "non-interference," it tramples Puerto Rico underfoot and occupies Panama's territory. This is not a friend of Latin America, but its enemy.
    Latin America has consistently extended its hand to the peoples of the world, striving to break free from its state of isolation between the two oceans, with its northern border neighboring the most voracious imperialism. There is an idiom in Latin America that clearly expresses this idea: "Poor Latin America, you are so far from God and so close to the United States!"
    Yesterday it was the "Inquisition," today it is the highest expression of the "Monroe Doctrine." The product of "Pan-Americanism," the "Organization of American States," means that the entire American continent belongs to the Yankees. Didn't the "Caracas Declaration" imposed by Foster Dulles attempt to prevent the exchange of ideas just like the "Inquisition"? According to this declaration, haven't several tons of books been destroyed at customs and police stations? And only because these books talk about materialism or socialism. But today, forty-two years after the October Revolution and ten years after the victory of the Chinese Revolution, it is no longer possible to obliterate the truth, just as it is impossible to prevent the people of all countries from seeing the bright trajectory of artificial satellites in the sky. As people say, these ideas cannot be forcibly removed from people's minds, nor can they be forcibly prevented from entering people's minds. It is futile for imperialism to use terror and suppression. In recent years, all the military dictatorships established to oppress the people have collapsed like castles built on sand, and what remains in the hands of imperialism has become a red-hot nail. For many years, imperialism felt safe with the support of bayonets, but the masses of the people overthrew the most tyrannical regime armed to the teeth by the United States and aided by U.S. military missions. The people of Latin America always remember the old saying: "Bayonets can be used against everything, but you can't sit on them."
    The people of Latin American countries are today directly engaged in a face-to-face struggle with imperialism. The focus of this struggle is in the Caribbean, and the vanguard of the struggle is Cuba. The people of Latin America are mobilized to shout: "Cuba!" "Fidel Castro!" This slogan is used everywhere to greet Eisenhower. Why does Cuba represent the heart of Latin America? Because Cuba has realized the strong desire of all Latin American people: without overthrowing imperialism and its agents and allies, the large landowners, there will be no progress, no people's welfare, and no national dignity. The slogan "Cuba and Fidel Castro!" means independence and land reform.
    At this moment when imperialism has torn off its smiling mask and is trying to find a diplomatic provocation to launch a large-scale military attack on Cuba, the people of Latin American countries are expressing their solidarity with the Cuban people and their firm support for the Cuban revolution with unprecedented unity. Not only political support, but also assistance to Cuba with their actions and blood.
    If one arrives in Cuba, the pearl of the famous Antilles Islands, today, the most touching sight is no longer its beautiful natural scenery, but the people who have won victory in armed struggle. The first impression given to travelers is moral health, the determination to fight, and the strength of the people.
    Walking on the streets are rebel soldiers and worker-peasant militias, who are an indispensable part of the Cuban people and life today. In these simple young men and women in olive-colored clothing, the truth and dignity of the Americas are embodied. There is no wavering or fearful expression on any face. They know that they are facing U.S. imperialism, but they feel the warmth of all progressive humanity extending a hand of solidarity to them. They also know that their cause is invincible.
    Isn't this felt here every moment? Cuba is truly independent for the first time ever.
    This force emanating from the Cuban Revolution fills the people of all Latin American countries with determination and courage.
    The United States raises its big stick in vain. Cuba will never retreat.
    The United States talks about "human rights" or "non-interference," but can the Cuban people believe it? The continuous bombing of sugarcane plantations by planes taking off from U.S. bases and the sabotage instigated by U.S. imperialists are enough to explain the problem, and the entire history of Cuba proves this point.
    The explosion of the "Maine" warship in Havana Harbor in 1898 marked the golden age of U.S. imperialist expansion. History shows that the imperialists themselves were the culprits of this explosion. And they themselves later shamelessly often praised this explosion, because it became the key to the Spanish-American War and U.S. imperialist expansion in the Caribbean, as well as in Latin America, the Philippines, and Asia. Now, after making various military preparations and starting a three-month military exercise, the United States is trying to make history repeat itself, and is looking for diplomatic or military excuses to intervene in Cuba and push back the rising tide of struggle for independence on the entire continent.
    The sixty-two years between the explosion of the "Maine" and the explosion of the "La Coubre" have not changed U.S. imperialism's methods and intentions towards the Caribbean and other parts of Latin America in the slightest. But in these sixty-two years, people have not only seen the barbaric expansion of U.S. imperialism, but also the rise of a great socialist world, the disintegration of imperialism, and the upsurge of the cause of national independence of all countries.
    U.S. imperialism and its lackeys attempted to ignite the fuse of intervention, and the "La Coubre" warship exploded in that port of Havana; but they forgot that the Cuban people, who had fought hard to seize power from Batista, supported by U.S. military missions, would not succumb and would not be intimidated. They forgot that the people of other Latin American countries will not allow U.S. imperialism to ravage Cuba again, because Cuba's cause is inseparable from the cause of all the people of Latin America.
    For many centuries, the history of the Latin American people has been a history of struggle for independence and national liberation, but with many failures. National independence has always been linked to the unity of Latin America. One hundred and fifty years ago, when Latin America rose up against the Spanish colonists, the people of all countries supported each other politically and militarily and achieved their independence. Bolivar from Venezuela and San Martin from Argentina led an army of people riding horses across Latin America, sowing the seeds of freedom.
    The great guerrilla fighter Sandino said: "The sovereignty of a nation is not defended by words, but by weapons." This precious call, issued in the forests of Nicaragua in 1930, has been deeply engraved in the hearts of the people of all countries. For a generation, Sandino's name has been a symbol of the fighters for our freedom. Today, the people have stood up from that isolated jungle, from the entire land of a vast continent.
    The struggle for independence in Latin America is part of the struggle of all oppressed nations for their liberation and independence. Their unity will bring victory. The independence activists in Puerto Rico understand this, the patriots in Panama understand this, and so do the guerrillas in Dominica, Nicaragua, and Paraguay, the patriots in Martinique, and the students in Brazil or Uruguay.
    At this hopeful moment of struggle, the people of Latin America regard the socialist world as their main friend. Many times, they have received the helping hand extended by the socialist camp in difficult times.
    The event yesterday when the Chinese people expressed their friendship towards Latin America will fill the hearts of millions of fighters with joy and hope. When the people of Latin America hold the hands of the Chinese people, they know that it is not only 800 million people who are congratulating and greeting each other, but that an eternal brotherhood is being established from now on.
    Imperialism has tried to put chains on us again and again, but our people, taking Cuba as an example, have learned to use the iron of these chains to forge sharp spears.
    Our future struggles will still be arduous, but as we know that we have so many and such good friends, the struggle will become more and more determined.
    China and the Latin American continent are far apart, but our common ideals, peace, independence, and friendship unite us closely.
    Regarding Latin America, many of you only know the outline on the map, which stands there like a heart or a fist from the southernmost tip of the world. Fist and heart. It is also accurate to use this image to describe it. Latin America is a sincere, red heart for its friends, the people of all countries around the world, and it will also be a clenched iron fist that will crush imperialism.

    把帝国主义的锁链变成回击帝国主义的长矛
    智利　何塞·万徒勒里
    中国—拉丁美洲友好协会的成立展开了中国人民和我们拉丁美洲人民之间关系的新的一页。友谊将深入所有善于识辨中国人民这种兄弟般团结一致的真诚友谊的拉丁美洲人的心坎。
    有些人认为拉丁美洲人不是以礼遇对待他们的客人的，另外有些人认为我们不懂得什么是友好关系。两年前一位副总统遭到唾弃而不得不声名狼藉地离开他“访问”的国家。不久前一位总统也打着“友好”的旗帜“访问”了拉丁美洲四个国家，但是，他的“访问”是在警卫森严的情况下进行的。这就给人们一个明显的印象：他不是去访问朋友，而是去和他的敌人相见。事实上，拉丁美洲人非常了解友谊这个字的含义，而且由于了解它的内容，他们善于分清哪些是他们的朋友，哪些不是他们的朋友。在经济、政治和文化上奴役他们的帝国主义者决不能指望得到同情，而只能遭到唾弃。美帝国主义在古巴甘蔗种植园上空投掷烧夷弹或企图以在人民中间散布死亡和破坏来进行捣乱活动的同时，用微笑是欺骗不了任何人的。它一面高唱“平等”、“尊重”和“不干涉”，一面却把波多黎各踩在脚下，霸占着巴拿马的领土。这不是拉丁美洲人的朋友，而是他们的敌人。
    拉丁美洲始终一贯向世界各国人民伸出它的手，力图摆脱处于两大洋之间，而北部又与最贪得无厌的帝国主义为邻的孤立状态。在拉丁美洲有一句成语，它明白地表达了这思想：“可怜的拉丁美洲，你离上帝那么远而离美国却这么近！”
    昨天是“宗教裁判”，今天是“门罗主义”的最高表现。“泛美主义”的产物“美洲国家组织”，这只意味着整个美洲大陆属于美国佬。难道福斯特·杜勒斯强加于人的“加拉加斯宣言”不是和“宗教裁判”一样企图阻止思想的交流么？根据这个宣言，不是已经在海关和警察所毁掉了好几吨书籍？而只因为这些书谈到唯物主义或社会主义。但是在十月革命四十二年和中国革命胜利十年的今天，再也不可能抹煞真理，正如同不可能阻止各国人民看到天空人造卫星光辉的航线一样。正如人们说的，不能用强力从人们头脑中除去这些思想，也不能用强力阻止这些思想进入人们的头脑。帝国主义使用恐怖和镇压都是徒劳的。近年来，所有为了压迫人民而建立起来的军事独裁统治，都已经像建立在沙上的楼阁一样纷纷崩溃了，而剩下在帝国主义手中的，也成为一颗烧红的铁钉。许多年来帝国主义靠着刺刀的支持感到很保险，但是，人民群众推翻了美国给武装到牙齿和由美国军事使团帮助的最暴虐的政权。拉丁美洲人民一直记住这句老话：“刺刀可用来对付一切，就是不能坐在上面。”
    拉丁美洲各国人民今天正是直接和帝国主义进行着面对面的斗争。这斗争的重心是在加勒比海，斗争的先锋是古巴。拉丁美洲人民都动员起来高呼：“古巴！”“菲德尔·卡斯特罗！”到处都用这口号来迎接艾森豪威尔。为什么古巴代表了拉丁美洲的心意？因为古巴实现了对所有拉丁美洲人民的强烈愿望：帝国主义及其代理人和同盟者大庄园主不被推翻，就没有进步，没有人民的福利，没有民族的尊严。“古巴和菲德尔·卡斯特罗！”的口号就意味着独立和土地改革。
    在这帝国主义撕下了微笑的假面具并且企图寻找一个外交挑衅来对古巴进行大规模的军事进攻的时刻，拉丁美洲各国人民之间以空前的团结行动来表示他们站在古巴人民一边并且坚决支持古巴革命。不仅是政治上的支持，而且要用他们的行动和鲜血来援助古巴。
    如果今天到达著名的安的列斯岛的明珠的古巴的时候，最动人的景象已经不是它美丽的大自然，而是武装斗争中胜利的人民。给旅行者的第一个印象是道德上的健康，斗争的决心和人民的力量。
    在街上走过的是起义士兵和工农民兵，他们是今天古巴人民和生活中不可缺少的一部分。在这些穿着橄榄色服装的纯朴的男女青年身上，就体现了美洲的真理和尊严。没有一张脸上有动摇和害怕的表情。他们知道他们面对着美帝国主义，但是他们感到向他们伸出声援之手的全体进步人类的热力。他们还知道他们的事业是不可战胜的。
    就在这里，不是每时每刻都感到这一点吗？古巴是破天荒第一次真正地独立了。
    古巴革命所发出的这股力量使拉丁美洲所有各国人民充满了决心和勇气。
    美国徒然地举起它的大棒。古巴决不会后退。
    美国谈论着“人权”或“不干涉”，但是古巴人民能相信它吗？从美国基地起飞的飞机不断对甘蔗种植园的轰炸以及美帝国主义者唆使的破坏活动就足够说明问题了，而古巴的全部历史也证明了这点。
    1898年哈瓦那港口“缅因号”轮船的爆炸标志着美帝国主义扩张的黄金时代。历史表明了帝国主义者自己是这次爆炸事件的祸首。而他们自己后来却毫不知耻地经常称颂这次爆炸，因为它成了美西战争和美帝国主义在加勒比海，同样在拉丁美洲、菲律宾和亚洲进行扩张的钥匙。现在，美国在作了各种军事准备并开始了将历时三个月的军事演习之后，又企图使历史重演，又寻找外交或军事借口来干涉古巴和使整个大陆日益高涨的争取独立的斗争浪潮后退。
      “缅因号”的爆炸和“勒库布尔号”的爆炸之间相隔的六十二年，并没有使美帝国主义对待加勒比海和拉丁美洲其他地方的方法和企图有丝毫改变。但是在这六十二年间，人们不仅看到了美帝国主义野蛮的扩张，而且看到了一个伟大的社会主义世界的兴起，帝国主义的分崩离析和各国人民民族独立事业的高涨。
    美帝国主义和它的走狗企图点起干涉的火药线，就在哈瓦那的那个港口爆炸了“勒库布尔号”轮船；但他们忘记了为了从受美国军事使团支持的巴蒂斯塔手中夺取政权而进行了艰苦斗争的古巴人民是不会屈服的，也是吓不倒的。他们忘记了拉丁美洲其他国家的人民也不会允许美帝国主义再次蹂躏古巴，因为古巴的事业和拉丁美洲所有各国人民的事业是分割不开的。
    许多世纪以来，拉丁美洲人民的历史是争取独立、民族解放而又多次失败的斗争史。民族独立又始终和拉丁美洲的团结一致联系在一起。一百五十年前，当拉丁美洲起来反抗西班牙殖民者的时候，各国人民从政治上、军事上彼此支持而取得了他们的独立。玻利伐尔从委内瑞拉、圣·马丁从阿根廷率领着一支人民的军队骑着骏马跑遍了拉丁美洲，撒下自由的种子。
    伟大的游击战士桑第诺说过：“一个民族的主权不是靠言词，而要用武器来保卫它。”这宝贵的号召在1930年尼加拉瓜的森林里发出后，已经深深地铭刻在各国人民的心中。在一个世代的时间里桑第诺的名字是争取我们的自由的战士们的象征。今天，人民已经从那个与世隔绝的丛林，从一个广漠的大陆的整个土地上站了起来。
    拉丁美洲争取独立的斗争是所有被压迫民族争取他们的解放和独立的斗争的一部分。他们的团结将带来胜利。波多黎各的独立运动者懂得这一点，巴拿马的爱国者懂得这一点，同样，多米尼加、尼加拉瓜、巴拉圭的游击战士，马尔提尼岛的爱国者，以及巴西或者乌拉圭的学生都懂得这一点。
    在这有希望的斗争的时刻，拉丁美洲人民把社会主义世界看作他们的主要的朋友。许多次，他们在艰难的时候得到了社会主义阵营伸出的援助的手。
    前天中国人民表达出对拉丁美洲的友谊这一事件，将使千百万战士的内心充满喜悦和希望。当拉丁美洲人民紧握住中国人民的手的时候，他们知道不仅是八亿人相互祝贺问候，而是从此建立起永恒的兄弟关系。
    帝国主义企图一次又一次地给我们套上锁链，但是我们的人民以古巴为榜样，已经学会了用这些锁链的铁来铸造锋利的长矛。
    我们今后的斗争仍然是艰巨的，但是当我们知道我们有那么多而且那么好的朋友，斗争将越来越坚决。
    中国和拉丁美洲大陆相距遥远，但是我们的共同理想、和平、独立和友谊使我们紧密团结一致。
    关于拉丁美洲，你们中间许多人还只知道地图上的轮廓，它从世界的极南端像一颗心脏或一个拳头矗立在那里。拳头和心脏。用这个形像来形容也很确切。拉丁美洲对它的朋友全世界各国的人民来说是一颗真诚的赤心，而又将是一个粉碎帝国主义的握紧的铁拳。
