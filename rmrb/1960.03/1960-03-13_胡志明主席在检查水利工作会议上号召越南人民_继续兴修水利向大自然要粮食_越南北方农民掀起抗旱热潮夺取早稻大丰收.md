Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 10th: According to reports in the local press, Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, warmly congratulated the farmers and other people of North Vietnam at a recent meeting to review water conservancy work for the great achievements made in water conservancy work last year.

President Ho called for continued water conservancy construction to irrigate 500,000 hectares of land that is still short of water and to extract an additional one million tons of rice from nature. He emphasized that irrigation projects must be completed in a timely manner to serve the agricultural collectivization movement.

According to the conference report, the total area of irrigated land for planting crops has increased from 923,000 hectares in 1955 to nearly 2 million hectares in 1959. The amount of earthwork completed in 1959 reached 84,857,000 cubic meters, compared to an annual average of 1 million cubic meters during the French occupation.

Vice Premier Pham Hung said at the closing meeting that the primary task in building water conservancy projects is to further develop small-scale irrigation systems while building a number of medium-sized and large-scale water conservancy projects.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, March 12th: Currently, farmers in various parts of northern Vietnam are launching a heatwave of drought resistance and fertilizer accumulation to seize a bumper harvest of early rice this year.

Since the beginning of spring, many provinces in northern Vietnam have experienced drought, making rice transplanting difficult due to water shortages, and the already transplanted seedlings are also threatened by drought. In order to overcome the drought, farmers in various regions have successively launched "drought resistance campaigns," and party and government leaders and cadres from various agencies have also gone to the countryside to fight alongside the farmers. Their exemplary actions have been praised by the farmers.

The vast number of farmers have a determination to fight drought as solid as a rock, and their fighting spirit is high. In order to divert water to irrigate fields and save seedlings, the farmers of Thanh Hoa Province broke down the boundaries of townships and cooperated closely to draw water from the river in layers. Farmers in Nghe An Province, which is severely affected by drought, are trying every possible means to open up water sources and actively resist drought. 322 agricultural cooperatives in Yen Thanh County continuously drew water, overcame the difficulty of water shortage, and rescued 550 mu of drought-stricken rice paddies from withering.

While working hard to fight drought, farmers in various regions have also launched a competition campaign of "accumulating 1,000 catties of fertilizer" per person.

    胡志明主席在检查水利工作会议上号召越南人民
    继续兴修水利向大自然要粮食
    越南北方农民掀起抗旱热潮夺取早稻大丰收
    新华社河内10日电　据这里的报纸报道，越南民主共和国胡志明主席在最近举行的检查水利工作的会议上热烈祝贺越南北方农民和其它人民在去年水利工作中取得的伟大成就。
    胡主席号召要继续兴修水利，灌溉五十万公顷仍然缺水的土地，向大自然多索取一百万吨水稻。他强调指出，灌溉工程必须及时完成，以便为农业合作化运动服务。
    据会议报告，种植农作物的水浇地总面积已经从1955年的九十二万三千公顷增加到1959年的将近二百万公顷。1959年完成的土方达到八千四百八十五万七千立方米，而在法国占领期间每年平均为一百万立方米。
    副总理范雄在闭幕会议上说，在兴修水利工程方面首要的任务是进一步发展小型灌溉系统，同时兴修若干中型和大型的水利工程。
    新华社河内12日电　目前越南北方各地农民正在掀起抗旱、积肥热潮，夺取今年早稻大丰收。
    入春以来，越南北方许多省份陆续发生旱象，使插秧工作遇到缺水的困难，已经插好的秧苗也遭受着干旱的威胁。为了战胜旱灾，各地农民接连发动了“抗旱战役”，各地党政领导人和机关干部也纷纷下乡同农民一起战斗。他们的模范行动受到农民的赞扬。
    广大农民抗旱的决心坚如磐石，斗志昂扬。清化省农民为了引水灌田，抢救秧苗，他们打破乡的界限，通力协作，分层从河里戽水。旱象严重的义安省的农民，千方百计地开辟水源，积极抗旱。晏城县三百二十二个农业社连续戽水，战胜缺水的困难，抢救了五百五十亩受旱稻田免于枯死。
    各地农民在奋力抗旱的同时，还开展了每人“积肥千斤”的竞赛运动。（附图片）
