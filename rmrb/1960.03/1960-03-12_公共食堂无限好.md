    Public canteens are infinitely good
    --Investigation of the Public Canteens of the Magu People's Commune in Hezhang, Guizhou--
    Investigation Team of the Hezhang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Written by Tan Pengzhi
    A Prominent Problem
    Magu Commune is located in the high and cold mountainous area of Hezhang County, Guizhou Province, with an altitude of 1,900 meters. The area is characterized by overlapping mountains, limited arable land, and the main crops are corn, buckwheat, oats, and potatoes. In 1958, under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the people here launched a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. At the same time, state-owned factories and mines here were expanded, and some new factories and mines were built, with the number of workers increasing sharply from more than 4,000 to about 10,000. The rapid development of industry presented the agricultural cooperatives around Magu Town with the task of increasing the supply of vegetables. With the great development of industrial and agricultural production, a prominent problem emerged: the labor force became increasingly tight.
    In July 1958, the Tiekuang (Iron Mine) Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative had the following tasks to complete within half a month: 2,200 mu of buckwheat and oats were waiting to be harvested; 600 mu of corn fields needed weeding; 300 mu of vegetables had to be planted; each person had to accumulate 5,000 jin of fertilizer; and 178 laborers had to go to steelmaking or road construction. The great development of production multiplied the demand for labor, while the labor force within the cooperative remained the same. At that time, there were a total of 710 laborers, of which 228 were transferred to state-owned industries, leaving most of the remaining labor force as women. Among the female labor force, only 20% regularly worked, 50% could only work half a day due to cooking and other housework, and the remaining 30% were completely tied up in housework and could not participate in production. According to the labor situation at that time, it was not enough to complete the harvesting task alone. Therefore, it was difficult to spare labor to engage in other production. At this time, the masses generally reflected: "There are many production projects, everything needs to be done, but we can't take care of everything."
    The tight labor situation existed not only in the Tiekuang Advanced Agricultural Cooperative, but also in all agricultural cooperatives in the Magu area. Therefore, resolving the contradiction of tight labor became an urgent matter.
    "Cook Together!"
    On July 5, 1958, Chen Faming, the Party General Branch Secretary of the Tiekuang Agricultural Cooperative, and Li Shunying, the female township head, personally went to Zhangkoudong team to help arrange production. They and the team's cadres and the masses calculated left and right, and the labor force was far from enough. For a time, they couldn't think of a good solution, and everyone was worried about this matter.
    Later, Chen Faming and several cadres specifically calculated the labor force account. After careful calculation, they found that more than 30 women in this team could not participate in production due to cooking, and more than 20 could only work half a day, accounting for more than 50% of the total labor force. This was indeed a very large force. How could they be able to go out and work in the fields? Chen Faming said: "Let's cook together. If one team cooks together, five or six people will be enough to cook, so more than 40 laborers can be freed up." At that time, Li Shunying was the first to agree. She said: "Yes! If we do this, not only will the labor force increase, but the food will also be better!" Originally, in recent months, Li Shunying was too busy with work to cook, so she fried corn to eat. She fried it once and ate it for seven or eight days, so she strongly agreed with "cooking together." After discussion, several team cadres also unanimously supported it. So they immediately went to discuss with the masses.
    The method of cooking together was warmly supported by the poor and lower-middle peasants, especially by women. Because it takes a long time to grind and cook corn and buckwheat, and when agricultural work is busy, cooking time is very rushed, and they eat half-cooked food before it's ready. Sometimes, to save trouble, they cook once and eat it for several days, and they often eat cold food. Because of these things, family disputes often arise. "Cooking together" can enable women to get rid of household chores and work in production like men. On that night, 56 out of 68 households in this team gathered together to discuss, and 24 households signed up on the spot, and they decided to start collective cooking the next day. Cooking required a kitchen, and Communist Party member Wang Shaoqing was willing to give up his house; Liu Guixiang and Huang Jinzhi signed up to be cooks. The people who signed up to join the canteen happily sent their rations, pots, bowls, tables, stools, firewood, and charcoal to the kitchen. In this way, 24 households first joined together.
    On July 8, the Party General Branch of the Tiekuang Advanced Agricultural Cooperative held a meeting of party members to introduce the experience of the Zhangkoudong Production Team in "cooking together" and to study the experiences of other places introduced in the newspapers. At this time, they realized that "cooking together" was a public canteen. Subsequently, in just a few days, the other five production teams also followed suit and set up public canteens.
    In September, 34 advanced agricultural cooperatives including Tiekuang were merged to form the Magu People's Commune. The establishment of the people's commune promoted greater development of production, and the desire of the commune members to run public canteens became more urgent, and the conditions were even better. Therefore, all production teams in the commune, like the Magu management area, successively established canteens, a total of 157, and more than 99.72% of the commune members joined the canteens.
    Let's Compare
    The establishment of public canteens has brought about great changes in people's living habits. When the canteen was first established, most people warmly supported it, while a few people thought that joining the canteen could free up more time for production, but on the other hand, they also had doubts. Some said: "It's difficult to please everyone. It's hard enough for two brothers to eat together, how can so many people be together and do it well!" The wealthy farmer Zhao Shucheng's family had doubts and only joined the canteen after watching for a while.
    When the public canteen was first established, Zhao Shucheng was originally unwilling to join, but he was afraid that others would say that he was backward, so he discussed with his family and planned to try eating in the canteen for a few days first. His wife didn't even agree to try it. Zhao Shucheng was afraid of being talked about by others, so he went to the canteen to eat alone. He ate in the canteen for a few days in a row, and the food became better and better, with more variety and to his taste, so he discussed with his wife again and mobilized the whole family to eat in the canteen. His wife said that it was convenient to eat vegetables at home, and you could make whatever you wanted. The big pot dishes in the canteen couldn't taste good. Zhao Shucheng had no choice but to take his food home to eat. His wife tasted the food in the canteen several times and felt that it was really better than what she made herself, so she agreed that the whole family would eat in the canteen and cook their own vegetables. Later, Zhao Shucheng saw that the canteen made three or four dishes every meal, and he could also buy side dishes, so he ate in the canteen for a few days and felt that the dishes were also better than what he made at home, so he bought the dishes back and asked his family to taste them. The family watched for more than 20 days, until they were sure that the canteen was better than eating at home, dispelled their doubts, and then joined the canteen.
    Like Zhao Shucheng's family, some wealthy peasants joined the canteen after watching for a period of time.
    The reason why public canteens are so attractive is, in summary, because they provide enough food, good food, are convenient and hygienic, and save money.
    The canteen implemented the principle of "eating with tickets, and saving for oneself." On the premise of saving grain, it achieved a combination of coarse and fine grains, and dry and thin food. For example, corn flour is used to steam dry rice, make porridge, cook dumplings, and also use corn flour, buckwheat flour, wheat flour, and potatoes to make "four-in-one" rice, etc. Now it can make more than ten kinds of rice. The canteen grows a lot of vegetables, and makes several dishes every meal, so that people can eat enough and have rich nutrition. Since the canteen was established, the commune has saved 1.28 million jin of grain. Not only is the rice good, but also the dishes are fragrant. Now the commune's canteen can make 16 kinds of dishes. Every meal has green vegetables, and there are also shallots, garlic, and peppers as spices. The small shop sells more than 20 kinds of pickles and salted vegetables, with all kinds of flavors. During festivals, people eat even better. Some canteens have already managed to slaughter a pig every half month or so. The masses reflected: "There are really many varieties of food, it's really good to be idle or busy; the cooks are clever, and we are full of energy after eating."
    The canteen also tries its best to provide convenience and care to the masses. People who join the canteen can eat in the canteen, or they can take the food home to eat; during the busy farming season, they can eat early or late, and they can get hot meals at any time. When agricultural work is tight, the cooks also deliver meals and boiled water to the construction sites and fields, eliminating the need for commune members to travel back and forth. There is special care for the elderly, children, pregnant women, women in confinement, and patients. In the winter of 1959, the commune also added nine elderly canteens and nine children's canteens, specializing in cooking for the elderly and children; thirteen canteens added patient recuperation rooms near the canteen. After family members go out to work, the cooks take care of the patients taking medicine and eating. Zhao Shucheng's wife was ill, and the canteen manager, Zhao Mingyun, personally visited her and sent her food, and she was so moved that she said: "Now the canteen staff takes care of us so well, better than our own relatives."
    Single men have a public canteen, just like having a home. Su Shunqiang, the deputy captain of the Zhangkoudong Production Team, was busy outside during the day and often had meetings at night before the establishment of the canteen. When he went back late at night, he still had to grind and cook. Sometimes he slept too late and missed work the next day. Therefore, he often cooked once and ate it for several days, and he often got sick from eating cold food and leftovers. After the establishment of the public canteen, he no longer had to worry about eating, and he worked even better. He was named a model in 1959. He said: "This model of mine was given by the canteen."
    Public canteens pay great attention to hygiene. All canteens are cleaned at least twice a day. Cooks wear masks and work clothes when they work. In order to reduce dust in the kitchen, many canteens have established separate stoves. Boiled water and hot water are constantly available. When commune members return from work, they have hot water to wash their faces, and they also have hot water to wash their feet at night. In the past, when individual households cooked, they were too busy to cook, so they didn't bother to boil water. Therefore, the masses in this area had been drinking raw water for a long time. After the establishment of the public canteen, the cooks delivered boiled water to the construction site, and everyone developed a good habit of drinking boiled water. In the past, the masses often ate raw rice, cold rice, and drank raw water, and some suffered from malaria and diarrhea; since the establishment of public canteens, malaria has been greatly reduced, and diarrhea has basically been eliminated.
    Public canteens have also greatly saved oil, salt, firewood, rice, and fuel. According to the statistics of the Huobazhai Production Team, from January to June 1958, the whole team used more than 150,000 jin of coal, and the average food cost per person per month was four yuan. From July 1958, when the public canteen was established, to July 1959, a total of 72,000 jin of coal was used in one year. The coal burned in one year was two-thirds less than the coal burned in half a year. The commune members' food costs dropped from the original four yuan to three yuan. In 1959, the canteen planted 1,750 mu of vegetables, produced more than 5.2 million jin of vegetables, raised 1,250 pigs, and raised 1,700 chickens, which is also a considerable income.
    "Another Great Liberation"
    The Magu Commune not only built public canteens, but also held 149 nurseries and 91 kindergartens, so that 74% of the children were admitted to nurseries and kindergartens. This greatly liberated the female labor force, so that more than 95% of the women in the commune participated in labor production. They called getting rid of household chores "another great liberation," saying that in the past it was "each household has many things to do, taking care of children and stirring pots," and now it is "with canteens and nurseries, women are liberated and laugh happily."
    After women participated in labor production, their production enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high, and their production skills were constantly improving. In the past, it was thought that only men could do plowing, ditching, harvesting, and other more technical agricultural work. Now women can not only do it, but also do it very well. They have become a new force in agricultural production. In 1959, the Tiekuang Management District alone had 12 female pacesetters named by the county party committee, such as "Production Model" Li Shunying, "Technical Innovation Expert" Xia Caiying, and "Double-Wheel Double-Share Plow Expert" Zhao Fengying, and 57 female models approved by the commune party committee. Chen Xiaoxiu, a 50-year-old pace-setter, had been cooking at home since she was in her thirties. After the canteen was established, she rejoined labor production. Although she was over half a century old, she was full of energy. Someone asked her why she didn't rest since she was so old. She said: "I have been cooking at home for more than 20 years. I am busy during the day and busy at night, and I am often complained about. Since I joined the canteen, I have hot meals to eat when I get off work, and my family is also harmonious. How can I not be motivated to work!"
    After women were freed from household labor, their mental outlook also underwent profound changes. In the past, they were entangled in household chores and had no time to participate in political and cultural studies. Their vision was only limited to the small circle of the family. Now, they have broken free from those constraints and are working in production like men, participating in political and cultural studies, and participating in various social activities. This has broadened their horizons and broadened their minds. Every canteen often uses meal times to read newspapers to the commune members and talk about current affairs; uses the time before and after meals to carry out regular literacy work; and uses the evening time to organize amateur cultural studies, so that women's political and cultural level is constantly improving. According to a survey by the Huobazhai Production Team, most of the 58 young and middle-aged women have gotten rid of illiteracy, of which 19 have reached the cultural level of elementary school, and 33 have reached the cultural level of primary school. Among these people, five are the leaders of cultural study groups, and one is the director of teaching affairs of the agricultural middle school. The woman Zhang Shoujun praised the canteen and said: "The collective canteen is a bright lamp, which makes women open their eyes; they can do both literary and martial arts, and women also want to innovate."
    After the establishment of the public canteen, the family disputes that often occurred in the past due to cooking, such as discord between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, disharmony between sisters-in-law, and disunity between husband and wife, also disappeared. Xie Xiaocheng, a three-sister-in-law in the Zhangkoudong Production Team, didn't want to cook at home in the past, and they were not united. Later, they each went back to their parents' home to live. After the public canteen was established, they all came back, lived together again, and worked together harmoniously. They said: "This is the reunion brought about by the public canteen." The women in the Tiekuang Management District sang: "The public canteen is like a flower, it gets rid of thousands of years of suffering, men and women are equal and engage in production, laughing happily day and night!"
    Made Great Contributions
    The establishment of the public canteen is the result of the great development of production, and its establishment has promoted the greater development of production.
    First of all, the canteen liberated a large number of female labor forces, and to a certain extent, eased the tight labor situation. In the whole commune, there were 5,710 households. When each household was cooking, 2,700 women were tied up in household chores and could not come out. After the establishment of the public canteen, the whole commune only used 680 people to cook, saving 2,020 female labor forces, which can increase more than 720,000 workdays a year.
    Secondly, because of collective eating, the phenomenon of unevenness in attendance, waiting for each other, and wasting time in the past has disappeared, and labor efficiency has been greatly improved. In 1959, the Magu People's Commune ran 45 zinc, iron, and other factories. The total grain output increased by 37% on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958. In this year, all kinds of agricultural work were completed ahead of schedule. For example, in the past, corn could only be harvested by the end of November. In 1959, it was harvested one month earlier. In the past, potatoes were always dug up across the year. In 1959, they were dug up by November. At the same time, the sown area and the deeply ploughed farmland were both expanded and increased by two times compared with 1958. In this year, more than 37,000 mu of vegetables were planted, and more than 140 million jin of vegetables were harvested, which was four and a half times more than in 1958, ensuring the needs of the factories for vegetables. Due to the increase in labor, 50 transportation teams were also organized. The entire commune's production landscape is changing rapidly.
    Although the public canteen has only been established for more than a year, it has made great contributions in promoting production development and organizing mass life, and is therefore deeply loved by the masses. Although individual wealthy peasants have attacked and sabotaged the canteen, it still stands like Mount Tai, unshakable, and not one has fallen. In June 1959, the canteen of the Second Team of the Tuanjie Production Team, when the commissary, the wealthy peasant Zhang Caiqing, colluded with the team leader Jiang Xingcai, who had serious right-leaning thoughts, forced the canteen to disband while the party branch secretary was attending a meeting in the commune. The masses were very angry about this. Ma Xuechang said: "The canteen is my home. Whether the food is good or bad, I will not leave the canteen." As soon as the party branch secretary came back, at the request of the masses, he immediately replaced the commissary, criticized Jiang Xingcai's wrong thoughts, and the canteen that had been disbanded for six days was restored. Hardships reveal true heroes. The public canteen has stood the test and shown its strong vitality. This communist sprout will surely play an increasingly greater role in promoting production and organizing life.

    公共食堂无限好
    ——贵州赫章妈姑人民公社的公共食堂调查——
    中共赫章县委调查组调查　谭鹏执笔
    一个突出的问题
    妈姑公社处在贵州省赫章县拔海一千九百米的高寒山区，境内山峦重叠，地多田少，主要生产包谷、荞子、燕麦和洋芋等粮食作物。1958年，这里的人民，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，掀起了工农业生产的大跃进高潮。同时，这里的国营厂矿进行了扩建，并新建了一些厂矿，工人由原来的四千多名猛增到一万名左右。工业的迅速发展，向妈姑镇周围的农业社提出了增加供应蔬菜的任务。随着工农业生产的大发展，出现了一个突出的问题：劳动力越来越紧张了。
    1958年7月，当时铁矿高级农业生产合作社，有以下几项任务要在半个月内完成：二千二百亩荞子和燕麦等着收割；六百亩包谷地要薅锄；要种植三百亩蔬菜；每人要积肥五千斤；有一百七十八个劳力要去炼钢铁或者去修马路。生产大发展，对劳动力的需要量成倍地增长着，而社内的劳动力还是那末多。当时共有劳动力七百一十人，其中有二百二十八人被调到国营工业方面去了，留下来的劳动力大部分是妇女。在妇女劳动力中，经常出工的只有20％，因做饭和其他家务事牵挂，每天只能出半天工的占50％，其余的30％，则完全被家务事缠住，不能参加生产。按当时的劳动力情况，只是完成收获任务也不够。因此，很难抽出劳动力去搞其他的生产。这时，群众普遍反映：“生产项目多，样样要搞，顾这头顾不了那头。”
    劳动力紧张的状况，不仅是在铁矿高级农业合作社存在，妈姑区所有的农业社也都一样。于是解决劳动力紧张的矛盾，就成为迫不及待的事了。
    “合起来煮！”
    1958年7月5日，铁矿农业社党总支书记陈发明和女乡长李顺英，亲自到张口洞小队去帮助安排生产。他们和小队的干部、群众在一起，左算右算，劳动力差得很多，一时想不出解决的好办法，大家都为这事发愁。
    以后，陈发明又同几个干部在一起具体地算劳动力的账。经过细算摸底，发现这个队因做饭不能参加生产劳动的妇女有三十多人，只能劳动半天的有二十多人，占总劳动力的50％以上。这确实是一支很大的力量。怎样才能使她们出门上坡搞生产呢？陈发明说：“大伙把饭合起来煮，一个队合起来，有五、六个人做饭足够了，这样就可以腾出四十多个劳动力。”当时李顺英第一个表示赞成。她说：“对！这样办，不但增加了劳动力，伙食也会搞得好呢！”原来，近几个月来，李顺英因为工作忙，来不及做饭，就炒包谷吃，炒一次，吃上七、八天，所以她非常赞成“合起来煮”。经过讨论，几个队干部也一致拥护。于是他们就立即分头去找群众商量。
    合伙煮饭的办法，受到贫农和下中农的热烈拥护，其中又以妇女要求最迫切。因为用包谷和荞子做饭，推磨和煮的时间都较长，农活一忙，做饭的时间很仓促，等不及就吃夹生饭。有时为了省事，做一次饭要吃几天，又经常吃冷饭。为了这些，还常闹家庭纠纷。“合起来煮”，就能使妇女摆脱家务累赘，和男子一样劳动生产。这个队六十八户人家，当晚就有五十六户聚集在一起商议，有二十四户当场报名，说合就合，决定第二天就集体开伙。煮饭需要厨房，共产党员王绍清愿让出房子；刘桂香和黄金芝报名当炊事员。报名参加食堂的人，欢欢喜喜地将口粮和锅、碗、桌凳以及柴炭等送到伙房去。就这样，二十四户人家首先合起伙来。
    7月8日，铁矿高级农业社党总支召开党员大会，介绍张口洞生产队“合起来煮”的经验，并学习报纸上介绍的外地经验。这时候，才知道“合起来煮”就是公共食堂。随后，只有几天的时间，其它五个生产小队也跟着办起了公共食堂。
    9月份，铁矿等三十四个高级农业社，合并建成了妈姑人民公社。人民公社的建立，促进了生产的更大发展，社员要求办公共食堂的愿望更迫切了，条件也更好了，于是全社各生产小队都像妈姑管理区一样相继办了食堂，共计办了一百五十七个，99．72％以上的社员都加入了食堂。
    比比看
    公共食堂的建立，使人们生活习惯发生了很大的变化。在食堂刚建立时，多数人热烈拥护，而少数人一方面认为参加食堂能腾出更多的时间去搞生产，另一方面也有怀疑。有的说：“众口难调，两弟兄在一起吃饭还搞不好呢，这么多人在一起，还能办好吗！”富裕农民赵树成一家，就是抱疑虑态度，经过一段时间的观望，才参加食堂的。
    公共食堂刚办时，赵树成本来不愿参加，但又怕别人说他落后，曾和家里的人商量，打算先到食堂里吃几天试试看。他老婆连试一试都不同意。赵树成怕别人议论他，就一个人到食堂去吃饭。他一连在食堂吃了几天饭，饭菜越来越好，花样又多，又合口味，他就又和老婆商量，动员全家都到食堂吃饭。老婆说，在家吃菜方便，想吃啥做啥，食堂里的大锅菜，做不出好味道来。赵树成无奈，又不好退伙，就把自己的饭打回家吃。他老婆几次尝到食堂的饭，觉得真比自己做得好，同意全家人都吃食堂里的饭，自己做菜吃。以后，赵树成看到食堂每顿都做三、四样菜，还可以买到小菜，他又一个人在食堂吃了几天饭，觉得菜也比家里做得好，又把菜买回去叫家里的人都尝尝。一家人就这样观望了二十多天，直到认定食堂就是比家里吃得好，解除了疑虑，才参加了食堂。
    和赵树成一家人一样，一些富裕农民都是经过一段时间观望，才加入食堂的。
    公共食堂所以有这么大的吸引力，概括地说，是因为它吃得饱、吃得好，既方便，又卫生，还节约。
    食堂贯彻执行了“凭票吃饭、节余归己”的原则。在节约粮食的前提下，做到把粮食粗细搭配，干稀调剂。如包谷面既蒸干饭，也做稀饭，煮疙瘩，还用包谷面、荞面、麦面和洋芋做成“四合一”饭等等，现在已能做十多种饭了。食堂大种蔬菜，每顿饭都做几个菜，做到既吃得饱，又有丰富的营养。自办食堂以来，全社已节约粮食一百二十八万斤。不但饭好，而且菜香，现在全社食堂已能做十六样菜。每顿既有青菜，还有葱、蒜、辣椒作香料，小卖部出售二十多种泡菜和咸菜，什么口味都有。逢到节日还要吃的更好些。有的食堂已经做到半月左右杀一头猪。群众反映说：“饭菜花样实在多，闲稀忙干真不错；炊事人员心灵巧，我们吃了干劲足。”
    食堂还尽量给群众以方便和照顾。参加食堂的人，可以在食堂吃，也可以把饭打回家去吃；农忙时可以早吃，也可以晚吃，随时都能吃到热饭热菜。在农活紧张时，炊事员还把饭菜和开水送到工地和田间，免除了社员往返劳累。对于老人、小孩、孕妇、产妇和病人，还有特殊的照顾。1959年冬天，全社还增设了九个老人食堂和九个幼儿食堂，专为老人和小孩做饭；有十三个食堂，在食堂附近增设了病人疗养室，家人出工后，炊事员照顾病人服药和吃饭。赵树成的老婆病了，食堂经理赵明云，亲自登门看望，并将饭菜送去，她被感动得说：“现在食堂工作人员照顾得真周到，比自己亲人还好。”
    单身汉有了公共食堂，就像有了家。张口洞生产队副队长苏顺强，在建立食堂以前，白天在外忙，晚上又常开会，夜深了回去，还得推磨做饭，有时睡得太晚，第二天就误了工。因此，常常做一次饭吃几天，吃了冷饭和剩饭又时常生病。成立公共食堂后，他再不为吃饭发愁，劳动得更好了，1959年被评上了模范。他说：“我这个模范，是食堂给的。”
    公共食堂很注意卫生。所有食堂，每天至少打扫两遍。炊事员工作时，都带口罩、穿工作服。为了减少厨房里的灰尘，很多食堂都建立了隔壁灶。开水、热水经常不断，社员收工回来，有热水洗脸，晚上还有热水洗脚。从前单家独户开伙时，做饭都忙不过来，哪还顾得烧开水，因而这个地方的群众长期以来都是喝生水。公共食堂成立后，炊事员把开水送到工地，大家都养成了喝开水的好习惯。过去群众因常吃生饭、吃冷饭、喝生水，有的闹疟疾和拉肚子；成立公共食堂以来，疟疾大大减少，拉肚子的现象已基本消灭了。
    公共食堂还大大节省了油、盐、柴、米和燃料。据火把寨生产队统计，1958年1月到6月份，全队用煤十五万多斤，每人每月平均伙食费四元。从1958年7月份成立公共食堂，到1959年7月止的一年期间，共用煤七万二千斤，一年烧的煤，比原来半年烧的煤还少二分之一，社员的伙食费由原来的四元降到三元。食堂1959年种菜一千七百五十亩，产菜五百二十多万斤，养猪一千二百五十头，养鸡一千七百只，这也是很大一笔收入。
    “又一次大解放”
    妈姑公社不仅建了公共食堂，还举办了托儿所一百四十九个，幼儿园九十一个，使74％的幼儿都入托儿所和幼儿园，这样就大大地解放了妇女劳动力，使全社95％以上的妇女都参加了劳动生产。他们把摆脱家务纠缠称为“又一次大解放”，说从前是“一家一户事情多，又带小孩又摸锅”，如今是“办了食堂托儿所，妇女解放笑哈哈”。
    妇女们参加劳动生产后，生产情绪空前高涨，生产技能也不断提高。过去认为只有男人才能做的犁地、打沟、收割和其它技术性较强的农活，现在妇女不仅能做，而且还作得很出色。她们已成为农业生产的一支生力军。1959年，仅铁矿管理区就出现了“生产模范”李顺英，“技术革新能手”夏采英，“双轮双铧犁能手”赵凤英等十二名县委命名的女标兵，和公社党委批准的五十七名女模范。五十多岁的标兵陈小秀，从三十多岁起就在家做饭，食堂建立后，才重新投入劳动生产。她虽然年过半百，却干劲冲天。有人问她年龄大了，为什么不休息，她说：“我在家做了二十多年的饭，白天忙，夜晚忙，辛辛苦苦还常常受到埋怨，自从参加食堂，一收工就有热饭吃，一家人也和气了，叫我劳动怎么不展劲呢！
    妇女从家务劳动中摆脱出来后，精神面貌也发生了深刻的变化。从前，她们被家务琐事纠缠，没有时间参加政治文化学习，她们的眼光只是局限在家庭小圈子里。现在，她们摆脱了那些束缚，和男人一样劳动生产，一样参加政治和文化学习，参加各种社会活动，这就使她们的眼界打开了，心胸开朗了。每个食堂，都经常利用吃饭时间，给社员读报纸，讲时事；利用饭前饭后时间，展开经常性的扫盲工作；利用晚上时间，组织业余文化学习，使妇女的政治文化水平不断提高。据火把寨生产队调查，五十八名青壮年妇女，绝大部分已脱离了文盲状态，其中十九人已达到高小文化程度，三十三人已达到初小文化程度。在这些人中，有五个人是文化学习的小组长，一个是农业中学的教导主任。妇女张守君歌颂食堂说：“集体食堂是明灯，照得妇女睁眼睛；文武双全都能干，妇女也要搞革新。”
    公共食堂建立以后，过去因为煮饭而常发生的婆媳不和、妯娌不睦、夫妻不团结等家庭纠纷，也没有了。张口洞生产队谢小成三妯娌，过去谁也不愿在家做饭，闹不团结，后来各自回娘家去住。公共食堂建立后，她们都回来了，又住在一起，在一块劳动，和和睦睦的。她们说：“这是公共食堂带来的团圆。”铁矿管理区的妇女们这样唱道：“公共食堂像枝花，千年苦处摆脱它，男女平等搞生产，白日夜晚笑哈哈！”
    立下了汗马功劳
    公共食堂的建立是生产大发展的结果，它的建立又促进了生产的更大的发展。
    首先，食堂把大批妇女劳动力解放出来，在一定程度上，缓和了劳动力的紧张状况。全社五千七百一十户，在一家一户做饭的时候，就有二千七百个妇女被家务事缠住出不来。办公共食堂后，全社只用了六百八十人做饭，节约了二千零二十个妇女劳动力，一年可增加七十二万多个劳动日。
    其次，由于集体吃饭，过去出工人齐马不齐、你等我望浪费时间的现象没有了，劳动效率大大提高。1959年妈姑人民公社办了锌、铁等工厂四十五个。粮食总产量在1958年大跃进的基础上，增加了37％。这一年，样样农活提前完成。如过去都是到11月底才能把包谷收完，1959年，提前一个月收完了；过去总是跨年度挖完洋芋，1959年到11月份就挖完了。同时，播种面积和深翻的田土都比1958年扩大和增加了两倍。这一年种蔬菜三万七千多亩，收菜一亿四千多斤，比1958年增加了四倍半，保证了工厂菜蔬的需要。由于劳动力增多，还组织了五十个运输队。整个公社的生产面貌在迅速地改变着。
    公共食堂建立的时间虽然只有一年多，但是它在促进生产发展和组织群众生活等方面，立下了汗马奇功，因而深受群众的爱戴。虽然个别富裕农民对食堂进行了攻击和破坏，但它依然像泰山一样屹立着，巍然不动，没有倒下一个。1959年6月，团结生产队第二小队的食堂，当司务长的富裕农民张才清拉拢有严重右倾思想的小队长蒋兴才，趁党支部书记到公社开会的时候，强迫解散食堂。群众对此十分气愤。马学昌说：“食堂就是我的家，吃好吃歹，我都不离开食堂。”党支部书记一回来，在群众的要求下，立即撤换了司务长，批判了蒋兴才的错误思想，解散了六天的食堂又恢复了。疾风知劲草，公共食堂经受了考验，显示出它强大的生命力。这个共产主义的幼芽，必将在促进生产和组织生活方面，发挥出越来越大的作用。
