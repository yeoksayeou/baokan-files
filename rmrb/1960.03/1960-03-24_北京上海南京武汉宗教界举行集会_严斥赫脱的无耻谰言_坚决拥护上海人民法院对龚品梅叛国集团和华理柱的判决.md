Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd. At a forum convened today by the Religious Group of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), people from Catholic, Christian, Buddhist, Islamic, and Taoist circles in Beijing sternly refuted the statement made by U.S. Secretary of State Herter on the 18th defending H. Ford. They said that Herter's clamoring once again demonstrates that U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people.

Religious figures in Beijing unanimously expressed their firm support for the Shanghai Intermediate People's Court's just trial of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary and treasonous group and the American spy H. Ford. They said this was a gratifying event and a great victory for the Chinese people and religious circles.

Cao Daosheng, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association, said: "Herter's statement is complete nonsense. Herter said that H. Ford's 'sole mission was religious.' Then let me ask, what does H. Ford's collection of information on our country's military airfields, the number and equipment of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in Korea, and intelligence on our country's important national defense construction have to do with religious activities? What do religious figures need this information for? If it belonged to religious activities, why did they use passwords and write secret letters in their activities? This shows that H. Ford is a spy in religious clothing. The fact that U.S. imperialism attempts to subvert our people's democratic government cannot be denied no matter what."

Yan Jiale, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee; Jiang Yizhen, Standing Committee Member of the National Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee; Wang Ruji, Deputy Director of the Beijing Catholic Patriotic Association; Xi Rao-Jia-Cuo, President of the Buddhist Association of China; Zhao Puchu, Vice President of the Buddhist Association of China; Zhang Jie, Deputy Director of the Islamic Association of China; Chen Yingning, Acting President of the Taoist Association of China; Li Yuhang, Deputy Secretary-General; Jia Zhenmin and Li Jingyi from the Catholic community; Ji Guang from the Buddhist community; and An Shiwei from the Islamic community also spoke at the forum. They emphasized that imperialism and their running dogs will not be reconciled to failure and death. Religious figures and believers must always be vigilant and fight to the end against all the conspiracies and sabotage activities of imperialism.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 22nd. The shameless statement by U.S. Secretary of State Herter defending the American spy H. Ford, who has been sentenced by our judicial organs, and attempting to shirk the U.S. government's responsibility, has aroused great anger among religious figures in Shanghai. On the afternoon of the 20th, more than a thousand Catholics held a rally, and many Catholics severely refuted Herter's shameless slanders with ironclad facts, unanimously expressing their determination to further heighten their vigilance and resolutely fight to the end against the criminal conspiracies of U.S. imperialism to invade and subvert our people's democratic government.

Zhang Shilang, Acting Bishop of the Shanghai Diocese of the Catholic Church, said that in order to verify the patriotic believers' exposure of H. Ford's espionage crimes, he had conducted an investigation with more than forty priests and church members. The investigation revealed that H. Ford colluded with the imperialist element Libberley to conspire to cooperate with the U.S. imperialist aggression activities and the restoration activities of the Chiang Kai-shek gang, and instructed the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary treasonous group to sign a "vow" with some bishops to resolutely be enemies of our government. This counter-revolutionary document was found under the statue of the Virgin Mary in the Sheshan Basilica in the suburbs of Shanghai. Zhang Shilang questioned Herter: "Isn't this 'vow,' whose content has nothing to do with religion, clearly ironclad evidence of H. Ford's subversive activities? Why doesn't your statement dare to touch on H. Ford's specific crimes?"

Jiang Minsheng, a priest of the Shanghai Catholic Christ the King Church who testified at the People's Court trial, used his personal experience to explain that after the "Catholic Central Bureau" was closed by our government, H. Ford still lived in Shanghai for a long time, directing the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary and treasonous group to collect information, sabotage, and subvert our people's democratic government.

Yang Zengnian, a young Catholic who served as a people's assessor and participated in the People's Court's trial of the American spy H. Ford, said angrily: "H. Ford collected our country's political, economic, and military intelligence through other imperialist spies and counter-revolutionary elements in the Catholic Church. Is this a religious 'mission'? Instructing and inciting believers to undermine government policies and laws and oppose the Chinese government, is this a religious 'mission'? Personally planning and directing the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary treasonous group to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, is this also a religious 'mission'? Mr. Herter, if foreigners were to carry out such a 'mission' on American soil, would the American government consider this legitimate?" This young Catholic said: "The new China of today is no longer the China of more than ten years ago when imperialism ran rampant. Anyone who dares to carry out criminal activities of sabotage and subversion in our country will be severely punished."

Hu Wenyao, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Catholic Patriotic Association; Yang Shida and Tang Lidao, Deputy Directors; Chen Fumin, a priest of the Shanghai Yangjingbang Catholic Church; Li Wenqin, a young female Catholic, and others also spoke at the meeting, severely refuting U.S. Secretary of State Herter's shameless slanders with ironclad facts.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, March 23rd. Religious circles in Nanjing held consecutive forums on the 18th and 21st, warmly supporting the Shanghai Intermediate People's Court's verdicts on the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary treasonous group and the American spy H. Ford.

Li Weiguang, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association and Bishop of the Nanjing Diocese of the Catholic Church, said at the forum: "The People's Court's judgment on Gong Pinmei and other fourteen traitors and the American spy H. Ford is another serious blow to the U.S. imperialism and its aggressive tool, the Vatican's conspiracy to subvert our people's democratic government. At the same time, it is also another great victory for the Chinese Catholics' anti-imperialist and patriotic struggle."

Wang Hao, Secretary-General of the Jiangsu Catholic Patriotic Association, said after introducing the situation of his participation in the public trial of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary treasonous group and the American spy H. Ford case in Shanghai: "The crimes committed by these traitors and spies have aroused our anger even more and strengthened our determination to fight against imperialism even more. We Catholics are clapping our hands and cheering for the People's Court's punishment of them according to law."

Li Rulin, Secretary-General of the Nanjing Catholic Patriotic Association, Tian Jiageng and Pi Shaoxu, priests of the Shigulu Catholic Church, and Sister Chen Shenge also spoke at the meeting, angrily condemning the towering crimes of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary treasonous group and the American spy H. Ford.

At the meeting, Ding Yuzhang, Vice President of Jinling Union Theological Seminary; Lu Jingheng, Secretary-General of the Nanjing Christian Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee; Shi Xin'an, pastor of Central Road Church; Yingche, President of the Nanjing Buddhist Association and Abbot of Kunlu Temple; Xu Pingxuan, Director of Nanjing Jinling Sutra Carving Office, and more than ten other religious figures spoke successively, unanimously supporting the verdict of the Shanghai Intermediate People's Court.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 23rd. Five hundred Catholics in Hubei Province and Wuhan City held a rally on the afternoon of the 22nd, unanimously supporting the Shanghai Intermediate People's Court's judgment on the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary treasonous group and the American spy H. Ford.

A statement passed by the conference called on patriotic believers throughout the province to further strengthen the study of socialism and the general line education, strive to raise their patriotic consciousness, eliminate the remaining influence of the Roman Curia, and embark on the path of independently running the church.

Many people spoke at the meeting, severely condemning the towering crimes of the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary treasonous group and the American spy H. Ford. Tu Shihua, Vice Chairman of the Hubei Catholic Patriotic Association and Bishop of the Hanyang Diocese, said: "The Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary treasonous group was organized under the planning of the U.S. imperialist spy H. Ford, with the aim of subverting our people's democratic government. Their crimes are extremely serious. The People's Court's just judgment not only severely cracked down on the imperialist conspiracy, but also purified the church. It is a gratifying event." Zhang Mingqian, Vice Chairman of the Hubei Catholic Patriotic Association and Bishop of the Yichang Diocese, also expressed his support for the verdict.

    北京上海南京武汉宗教界举行集会
    严斥赫脱的无耻谰言
    坚决拥护上海人民法院对龚品梅叛国集团和华理柱的判决
    据新华社23日讯　在由政协全国委员会宗教组今天召集的座谈会上，北京天主教、基督教、佛教、伊斯兰教、道教界人士，严词驳斥美国国务卿赫脱18日为华理柱辩护的声明。他们说，赫脱的叫嚣，再一次说明美帝国主义是中国人民的死敌。
    北京宗教界人士一致表示坚决拥护和支持上海市中级人民法院对龚品梅反革命叛国集团和美国间谍分子华理柱的严正审判。他们说这是大快人心的事情，是中国人民和宗教界的一个大胜利。
    中国天主教友爱国会副主席曹道生说：“赫脱的声明完全是一派胡说。赫脱说华理柱的‘唯一使命是宗教性的’，那末试问，华理柱搜集我国军用机场的情况，搜集中国人民志愿军部队在朝鲜的人数、装备以及我国重要国防建设的情报，这一切与宗教活动有什么相干？宗教人士要这些情报干什么呢？如属于宗教活动，他们又为什么在活动中使用密码、写密信呢？足见华理柱是披着宗教外衣的间谍分子。美帝国主义企图颠覆我国人民民主政权的事实无论如何是赖不掉的。”
    北京市基督教三自爱国运动委员会副主席阎迦勒，中国基督教三自爱国运动委员会常务委员蒋翼振，北京市天主教友爱国会副主任王汝楫，中国佛教协会会长喜饶嘉错，中国佛教协会副会长赵朴初，中国伊斯兰教协会副主任张杰，中国道教协会代会长陈樱宁、副秘书长黎遇航，天主教界人士贾振民、李静宜，佛教界人士济广，伊斯兰教界人士安士伟也在座谈会上发言。他们强调指出，帝国主义和他们的走狗是不会甘心失败和甘心死亡的，宗教界人士和宗教徒随时随地要提高警惕，同帝国主义的一切阴谋破坏活动斗争到底。
    据新华社上海22日电　美国国务卿赫脱为已经被我国司法机关判刑的美国间谍分子华理柱辩护、妄图推卸美国政府罪责的无耻声明，激起了上海市宗教界人士的极大愤怒。20日下午，一千多名天主教徒举行集会，许多教徒以铁一般的事实严厉驳斥赫脱的无耻谰言，一致表示要进一步提高警惕，坚决同美帝国主义侵略和颠覆我国人民民主政权的罪恶阴谋斗争到底。
    天主教上海教区代理主教张士琅说，为了证实爱国教徒对华理柱间谍罪行的揭发，他曾经同四十多位神甫和教友作过调查。调查结果，查获了华理柱同帝国主义分子黎培理共谋策应美帝国主义侵略活动和蒋匪帮复辟活动，指令龚品梅反革命叛国集团同一些主教订立坚决同我国政府为敌的“誓愿书”。这个反革命文件是在上海郊区佘山圣母堂的圣母像下被查获的。张士琅质问赫脱：“这个内容同宗教根本无关的‘誓愿书’，不明明是华理柱进行颠覆活动的铁证吗？你的声明为什么不敢触及华理柱这样具体的罪行呢？”
    在人民法院审判时出庭作证的上海天主教君王堂神甫蒋敏声，以他亲身的见闻，说明华理柱在“天主教中央局”被我国政府封闭后，仍然长期住在上海，指挥龚品梅反革命叛国集团进行搜集我国情报、破坏和颠覆我国人民民主政权等间谍活动。
    担任人民陪审员、参加人民法院对美国间谍分子华理柱审判的青年教徒杨增年愤怒地说：“华理柱通过其他帝国主义间谍和天主教中的反革命分子搜集我国政治、经济、军事情报，这是宗教‘使命’吗？指使和煽动教徒破坏政府政策、法令，反对中国政府，这是宗教‘使命’吗？亲自策划和指挥龚品梅反革命叛国集团进行反革命活动，这也是宗教‘使命’吗？请问赫脱先生，如果有外国人在美国的领土上执行这样的‘使命’，美国政府能认为这是正当的吗？”这位青年教徒说：“现在的新中国，已经不是十多年前帝国主义横行无忌的中国了，谁胆敢在我国进行破坏和颠覆的罪恶活动，我们就要给他以严厉的制裁。”
    上海市天主教友爱国会筹委会主任胡文耀、副主任杨士达、汤履道，上海洋泾浜天主堂神甫陈辅民、青年女教徒李文?等人在发言中，也以铁一般的事实，严厉驳斥美国国务卿赫脱的无耻谰言。
    据新华社南京23日电　南京市宗教界18日和21日连续举行座谈会，热烈拥护上海市中级人民法院对龚品梅反革命叛国集团和美国间谍华理柱的判决。
    中国天主教友爱国会副主席、天主教南京教区主教李维光在座谈会上说：“人民法院对龚品梅等十四名叛国犯和美国间谍华理柱的判决，是对美帝国主义和它的侵略工具——梵蒂冈颠覆我国人民民主政权的阴谋的又一次严重打击，同时也是中国天主教友反帝爱国斗争的又一伟大胜利。”
    江苏省天主教友爱国会秘书长汪皓介绍了他在上海参加公审龚品梅反革命叛国集团和美国间谍华理柱案件的情况以后说：“这些叛国分子和间谍分子所犯的罪行，更激起了我们的愤怒，更增强了我们反帝斗争的决心。人民法院对他们依法惩处，我们天主教人无不拍手称快，欢欣鼓舞。”
    南京天主教友爱国会秘书长李汝霖，石鼓路天主堂神甫田家耕、披少虚，修女陈圣娥等，也都在会上发言，愤怒地指斥了龚品梅反革命叛国集团和美国间谍华理柱的滔天罪行。
    会上，金陵协和神学院副院长丁玉璋，南京市基督教三自爱国运动委员会秘书长陆景珩，中央路堂牧师史信三，南京市佛教协会会长、昆卢寺方丈映彻，南京金陵刻经处主任徐平轩等十多位宗教界人士，都先后发言，一致拥护上海中级人民法院的判决。
    据新华社武汉23日电　湖北省和武汉市五百名天主教徒22日下午集会，一致拥护上海市中级人民法院对龚品梅反革命叛国集团和美国间谍分子华理柱的判决。
    大会通过的一项声明号召全省爱国教徒进一步加强社会主义和总路线教育的学习，努力提高爱国主义觉悟，肃清罗马教廷的残余影响，走上独立的自主自办教会的道路。
    许多人在会上发言，严厉斥责龚品梅反革命叛国集团和美国间谍华理柱的滔天罪行。湖北省天主教友爱国会副主席、汉阳教区主教凃世华说：“龚品梅反革命叛国集团是在美帝国主义间谍分子华理柱策划下组织起来的，旨在颠覆我国人民民主政权，他们的罪行是极其严重的。人民法院这一严正判决，不仅沉重地打击了帝国主义的阴谋，也纯洁了教会，是一件大快人心的好事。”湖北省天主教友爱国会副主席、宜昌教区主教张鸣谦，也表示拥护这个判决。
