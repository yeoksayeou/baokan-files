Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 12th. Anshan Iron and Steel workers put forward more than 30,000 innovation proposals and created nearly 5,000 new production records in the first ten days of March, thus promoting a rapid rise in production levels. Compared with February, the average daily output in the first ten days of March increased by 9% for steel, 4.7% for pig iron, 0.9% for steel products, 10.4% for artificial rich ore, and 11.9% for iron concentrate.

After the workers of various factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel responded to the initiative of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, they quickly launched a new upsurge in production. Recently, the Anshan Iron and Steel Party Congress issued a battle call for a great battle in March, demanding that all Party members and the broad masses of workers go full steam ahead, advance at high speed, complete the first quarter's steel production plan ahead of schedule, and effectively prepare for the second quarter.

At present, the various factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel are vigorously promoting the spirit of communist cooperation. Factories and factories, work sections and work sections, furnaces and furnaces, individuals and individuals support and cooperate with each other to jointly solve key production problems and rapidly improve production levels. The First Steel Plant transferred Cui Yucheng, a furnace protection expert and chief furnace foreman of the No. 6 open hearth furnace, and Jiang Derong, a charging expert, to form a cooperative performance team to proactively "deliver experience." They performed rapid steelmaking on the No. 15 and No. 18 open hearth furnaces, reducing the smelting time for each furnace to less than eight hours, which is more than two hours shorter than before. Production experts from ten units, including the Sintering Plant and Dagushan Mine, formed a communist cooperation team to help workers at the Dong'anshan Mine break through the flotation barrier. They performed techniques and disseminated advanced operating experience for several consecutive days, enabling the workers at the Dong'anshan Mine to improve their technical operating level and rapidly increase the output of iron concentrate.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 12th. Under the slogan of "Decisive Battle in March, Strive for a Complete Victory in the First Quarter," the workers of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company launched a new upsurge in production, increasing steel output in the first ten days of March by 13.4% and steel products by 7.9% compared to the first ten days of February.

At the beginning of March, various factories of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company held oath-taking and skills competition rallies. From steelmaking to rolling, from production departments to auxiliary departments, workers were showing their skills in the competition upsurge. In ten days, the company's production system employees put forward more than 10,000 innovation proposals and implemented more than 500 major innovation projects. The two open hearth steelmaking plants (workshops) implemented more than 30 innovation projects to expand furnace output and strengthen smelting, which played a significant role in achieving more loading and faster smelting.

    钢铁战士夺高产　三月更比二月强
    鞍钢头十天钢产量比上月份提高9％
    重钢职工誓师比武上旬钢产量大丰收
    据新华社鞍山12日电　鞍钢职工在3月上旬提出革新建议三万多件，创造生产新纪录近五千个，从而促进生产水平迅速上升。3月上旬的平均日产量同2月份相比，钢提高9％，生铁提高4．7％，钢材提高0．9％，人造富矿提高10．4％，铁精矿提高11．9％。
    鞍钢各厂矿职工响应石景山钢铁公司的倡议以后，迅速掀起了生产新高潮。最近，鞍钢召开的党代表大会，又发出了大战3月的战斗号召后，要求全体党员和广大职工开足马力，高速度地前进，提前完成第一季度钢铁生产计划，并且要切实地为第二季度作好准备。
    目前，鞍钢各厂矿正在大兴共产主义协作之风，厂与厂，工段与工段，炉与炉，个人和个人，都相互支援、相互协作，共同解决生产关键问题，迅速提高生产水平。第一炼钢厂抽调护炉能手、六号平炉总炉长崔玉琛，加料能手姜德荣等，组成协作表演队，主动登门
  “送经”，在十五号、十八号两座平炉上表演快速炼钢，使每炉钢熔炼时间都压缩在八小时以下，比过去缩短了两个多小时。烧结总厂、大孤山矿等十个单位的生产能手，组成了共产主义协作队，帮助东鞍山矿职工突破浮选关，他们连续几天表演技术，传播先进操作经验，使东鞍山矿职工提高了技术操作水平，铁精矿产量迅速上升。
    据新华社重庆12日电　重庆钢铁公司职工在“决战三月份、誓夺一季满堂红”的口号下，掀起新的生产高潮，使3月上旬钢产量比2月上旬增长13．4％，钢材增长7．9％。
    3月初，重庆钢铁公司各厂纷纷举行誓师比武大会。职工们从炼钢到轧钢，从生产部门到辅助部门，都在竞赛热潮中大显身手。十天中，全公司生产系统职工提出了一万多件革新建议，实现了重大的革新项目五百多项。两个平炉炼钢厂（车间）实现了三十多项扩大炉产量、强化冶炼等革新项目，对实现多装快炼起了很大的作用。
