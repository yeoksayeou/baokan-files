Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 13th (Reporter Yan Biao) - Belkacem, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Algeria, told Xinhua News Agency reporter in a solo interview today that de Gaulle's recent hawkish speech in Algeria did not surprise the Algerian people, as they never had any illusions about de Gaulle's intentions. The Algerian people are prepared to resolutely continue the armed struggle until their fundamental goal—independence—is achieved.

Belkacem said that it is now clear to anyone that de Gaulle should bear full responsibility for continuing the colonial war in Algeria.

The Deputy Prime Minister stated that the Algerian people would not agree to negotiate with the French unless it was based on national independence. No neo-colonialist solution can deceive the Algerian people.

Belkacem then analyzed de Gaulle's political conspiracy and clearly stated the Algerian government's position. He said that, due to defeats on the battlefield, de Gaulle was forced to recognize Algeria's right to self-determination. De Gaulle first attempted to use the magic of this word to deceive world opinion, while simultaneously attempting to sow discord among the Algerian ranks. The Algerian government accepted this challenge. It proposed negotiations on the political and military conditions for a ceasefire, as well as on the terms and conditions for implementing the principle of self-determination. He said that in this way, the Algerian government expressed its desire for peace and its desire to resolve the Algerian issue within the full exercise of national sovereignty.

Belkacem continued, "However, de Gaulle rejected Algeria's proposal and evaded negotiations with the Algerian Provisional Government." Belkacem accused de Gaulle of waging war more fiercely than ever before with the support of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and of turning part of Algerian territory into a nuclear test base. He said, "Therefore, the Western propaganda that de Gaulle's policies can lead to a peaceful resolution is completely absurd."

When asked by the Xinhua News Agency reporter about the Algerian Provisional Government's attitude towards the alleged French plot to "split Algeria," the Deputy Prime Minister replied that as early as 1956, the French government attempted to artificially separate the Sahara from Algeria in order to incorporate it into France. The French government then proposed to unite with European and American capitalist companies to exploit the Sahara's underground resources. He said that, however, the Algerian armed struggle stopped this imperialist plunder.

In this regard, the Deputy Prime Minister also called for attention to the current talk of "Israelization" of Algeria. He pointed out that French imperialists are formulating plans to divide part of Algerian territory to a minority of Europeans, while at the same time dividing other parts of Algeria on religious and regional grounds. He said that the Algerian people condemn this plan to violate their national unity and territorial integrity. After six years of revolutionary war waged by the entire Algerian people, division is impossible. He emphasized, "For the Algerian people, independence and national unity are inseparable."

When asked about the military situation in Algeria, Belkacem (who is also Chairman of the Algerian Inter-Ministerial Defense Committee) first recounted the Algerian army's crushing of the French invading army's Challe Plan. He said that the Challe Plan included using all strategic reserves and mobilizing approximately 100,000 troops at a time to attack the areas liberated by the Algerian Liberation Army. They believed that in this way, they could eliminate the Algerian army's forces and its political and logistical institutions.

Belkacem continued, faced with this situation, the Algerian National Liberation Army transformed its large formations into smaller units that were more mobile and less vulnerable to attack, thus successfully avoiding being surrounded by the enemy. While adopting a defensive strategy, the National Liberation Army also launched rapid counterattacks and surprise ambushes against the French army's weak strongholds. In this way, the ambitious and costly plan of French imperialism's commander-in-chief of the army stationed in Algeria, Challe, was defeated not only militarily but also politically. The French army became exhausted from the futile occupation of these areas and had to withdraw, whereupon the Algerian army regained control of these areas. These situations occurred in South Oran, the Ouarsenis, Greater Kabylia, and North Constantine.

The Deputy Prime Minister said that although the French army has been defeated, it seems to be holding onto the Challe Plan, obviously because it has no other option. However, the Algerian National Liberation Army, with its understanding of the enemy's strategy, has never fought a passive battle. As in the past, they are capable of thwarting all the strategies of the French army command.

Belkacem made a comparison between the French army's increasing weakness and the Algerian National Liberation Army's increasing strength.

He said that the signs of the French army's weakness are first manifested in the frequent mobilization of new reinforcements and the urgent request for additional supplies and equipment in recent months. At the same time, despite the various conspiracies of the French army, the crisis that is shaking the French army and their contradictions very clearly illustrate the chaotic situation and the low morale of the French army. On the Algerian side, their troops have the advantages of mobility and agility, which render the enemy's heavy weapons useless. Their armaments are gradually improving, their soldiers have rich combat experience, and they know the local situation well. In addition, schools and training centers are now constantly training young officers and soldiers who are full of vigor and trained in revolutionary warfare methods.

Belkacem also revealed that Algeria has gathered a group of newly trained troops on the border, ready to take action at any time.

In talking about the Algerian army's military command, he emphasized that important decisions have been made to strengthen the military organization. He said that a new Chief of Staff has been appointed, who is both young and has rich combat experience.

Belkacem concluded by saying that the source of the Algerian army's strength lies in the fact that the Algerian army is a patriotic volunteer army, an army of the people with the lofty ideal of national independence. He expressed his unwavering conviction in the final victory of the Algerian National Liberation Army, the Algerian people, and Algeria's struggle for national independence.

### 贝勒卡塞姆向新华社记者发表谈话  阿尔及利亚决心以武装斗争求民族独立

    贝勒卡塞姆向新华社记者发表谈话
    阿尔及利亚决心以武装斗争求民族独立
    民族解放军愈战愈强完全能够粉碎法军的侵略阴谋
    新华社开罗13日电　本社记者言彪报道，阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府副总理兼外交部长贝勒卡塞姆今天在这里单独接见新华社记者时说，戴高乐最近在阿尔及利亚发表的好战的谈话并没有使阿尔及利亚人民感到意外，因为他们从来没有对戴高乐的意图有过任何幻想。阿尔及利亚人民准备坚决继续进行武装斗争，直到他们的根本目的——独立——实现为止。
    贝勒卡塞姆说，现在，对任何人来说这已经很清楚，戴高乐应该对继续在阿尔及利亚进行殖民战争负完全的责任。
    这位副总理表明，除非以民族独立为基础，否则阿尔及利亚人民将不同意和法国人谈判。任何新殖民主义的解决办法都欺骗不了阿尔及利亚人民。
    贝勒卡塞姆接着分析了戴高乐的政治阴谋，并且明确地申述了阿尔及利亚政府的立场。他说，由于在战场上失利，戴高乐被迫承认了阿尔及利亚的自决权利。戴高乐首先企图利用这个字的魔力来欺骗世界舆论，而同时企图在阿尔及利亚的队伍中间散布不和。阿尔及利亚政府接受了这种挑战。它建议就停火的政治和军事条件以及就实施自决原则的条款和条件进行谈判。他说，这样阿尔及利亚政府就表示了和平的愿望，表示了在充分行使国家主权的范围内解决阿尔及利亚问题的愿望。
    贝勒卡塞姆继续说，但是，戴高乐拒绝了阿尔及利亚的建议，并且逃避同阿尔及利亚临时政府进行谈判。贝勒卡塞姆指责戴高乐在北大西洋公约组织支持下比以前任何时候更凶恶地进行战争，并且把阿尔及利亚领土的一部分变为核试验基地。他说，“因此，西方所谓戴高乐的政策能够导致和平解决的那种宣传完全是无稽之谈。”
    新华社记者问贝勒卡塞姆副总理，阿尔及利亚临时政府对所传法国打算搞“分裂阿尔及利亚”的阴谋采取什么态度，这位副总理回答说，早在1956年，法国政府就企图人为地把撒哈拉从阿尔及利亚分裂出去，以便把它并入法国。法国政府接着建议同欧洲和美国的资本家的公司联合起来以便开采撒哈拉的地下资源。他说，但是阿尔及利亚的武装斗争制止了帝国主义的这种掠夺行动。
    在这方面，这位副总理还要求注意目前所谓阿尔及利亚“以色列化”的谈论。他指出，法国帝国主义者正在制订计划以便把部分阿尔及利亚的领土划给少数欧洲人，而在同时把阿尔及利亚的其它地方在宗教和地域的基础上予以划分。他说，阿尔及利亚人民谴责这种侵犯他们民族团结和领土完整的计划。在阿尔及利亚全体人民进行了六年革命战争以后，分割是不可能的。他着重指出，“对于阿尔及利亚人民来说，独立和全国统一是不能分开的。”
    记者问到阿尔及利亚的军事形势，贝勒卡塞姆（他兼阿尔及利亚国防部际委员会主席）首先追述了阿尔及利亚军粉碎法国侵略军夏耳计划的情况。他说，这个夏耳计划包括利用一切战略后备力量，一次调动十万人左右的兵力来进攻阿尔及利亚解放军所解放的地区。他们以为，这样，他们就能消灭阿尔及利亚军的部队和它的政治和后勤机构。
    贝勒卡塞姆接着说，面临这种形势，阿尔及利亚民族解放军就把它大的编制化为更为机动、不那么容易遭到攻击的较小的单位，从而成功地没有被敌人包围。在采取防御战略的同时，民族解放军还对法军有弱点的据点展开快速反击和出其不意的伏击。这样，法国帝国主义驻阿尔及利亚军总司令夏耳的这个野心勃勃和耗资浩大的计划就不仅在军事上而且在政治方面都遭到了失败，法军对于在这些地区徒劳无益的占领感到疲于奔命了，最后不得不撤退，于是阿尔及利亚军重新控制了这些地区。这些情况，在南奥兰、瓦尔斯尼斯、大卡比利亚和北君士坦丁都发生过。
    这位副总理说，法军虽然遭到了失败，显然是由于没有其他办法，现在似乎仍然抱住夏耳计划不放。可是阿尔及利亚民族解放军由于洞悉敌人战略，始终不打被动仗，他们像过去一样，是能够挫败法军司令部的一切策略的。
    贝勒卡塞姆就法军愈来愈弱和阿尔及利亚民族解放军的力量愈来愈增长作了对比。
    他说，法军软弱的迹象首先表现在最近几个月中经常调动新的增援部队和紧急要求增拨物资和装备。同时，尽管法军施展种种阴谋，但是，动摇法军的危机以及他们的矛盾非常明显地说明法军的混乱情况和法军士气的低落。在阿尔及利亚人方面，他们的部队具有机动、灵敏的有利条件，这些条件使敌人的重型武器无用武之地。他们的军备正在日渐改进，他们的战士具有丰富的作战经验，通晓地区的情况。此外，学校和训练所现在正不断培养出年青的军官和士兵，他们朝气蓬勃，受过进行革命战争方法的训练。
    贝勒卡塞姆还透露，阿尔及利亚在边境集结了一批新训练的部队，随时准备采取行动。
    他在谈到阿尔及利亚军的军事指挥时强调说，已经为加强军事组织采取了重要的决定。他说，已经任命了一位新的参谋长，他是既年青，又富有战斗经验。
    贝勒卡塞姆最后说，但是，阿尔及利亚军队的力量源泉在于阿尔及利亚军是爱国的志愿军，是怀有民族独立的崇高理想的人民的军队。他表示，他对阿尔及利亚民族解放军、阿尔及利亚人民和阿尔及利亚争取民族独立的斗争的最后胜利坚信不渝。
