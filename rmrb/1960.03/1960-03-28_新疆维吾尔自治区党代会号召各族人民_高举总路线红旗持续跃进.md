The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Party Congress called on people of all ethnic groups to hold high the red flag of the General Line and continue to leap forward

    (Our Dispatch) The Second Meeting of the First Congress of the Communist Party of China in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region was held from February 25th to March 12th. The meeting called on all Party members and people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region to hold even higher the red flags of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, to summon up revolutionary vigor, and to strive to complete and over fulfill this year's national economic plan, to achieve a better and more comprehensive leap forward this year, and to continuously leap forward in the future.
    The Congress analyzed the current excellent situation and put forward the tasks for a better and more comprehensive leap forward in 1960 and continued leap forward in the future. Comrade Wang Enmao, First Secretary of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, delivered a work report to the Congress on behalf of the Autonomous Region Party Committee. The meeting unanimously adopted the resolution on this work report. The meeting also elected additional members and alternate members of the Autonomous Region Party Committee. Finally, Comrade Wang Enmao made a summary of the meeting.
    The Congress noted with satisfaction that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, the Party organizations and people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region have carried out tremendous work in the three and a half years from the First Meeting of the First Congress of the Autonomous Region Party Representatives in July 1956 to the Second Meeting, especially since 1958, and have completed the socialist transformation, achieved victory in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, realized the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959 for two consecutive years, and realized the communization of the people in a very short period of time. The national economy of the Autonomous Region has experienced a situation of high-speed, proportional development, and all aspects of construction have achieved great achievements. In 1959, the total industrial and agricultural output value of the Autonomous Region increased by more than 90% compared with 1957. The pastoral economy has also experienced significant growth in the past two years. The 451 People's Communes in the Autonomous Region have embarked on a path of sound development, and the commune economy has greatly developed. In the past two years, the state-owned agricultural and pastoral economy, mainly based on the Production and Construction Corps, has also achieved great development. By 1959, the cultivated land area had reached 9.95 million mu, an increase of 168% compared with 1957. With the development of industrial and agricultural production and construction, capital construction, transportation, finance and trade, and cultural, educational, and scientific undertakings have all achieved high-speed development, further improving and enhancing the material and cultural lives of the people of all ethnic groups.
    Currently, the socialist construction of the Autonomous Region has entered a new stage of great development. In this new stage, the task of the Autonomous Region is to better implement the Party's General Line for socialist construction and a complete set of policies for walking on two legs, to continuously achieve the Great Leap Forward, and to unremittingly build the Autonomous Region into a base of steel, petroleum, coal, non-ferrous metals, rare metals, machinery, textiles, sugar making, and other industries, as well as a cotton-planting base for the motherland. Implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and accelerating the development of agriculture under the condition of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, and at the same time vigorously strengthen the transportation industry. Actively develop education, science and culture, and health undertakings, vigorously carry out the technical revolution and cultural revolution movements, and vigorously train scientific and technological cadres. Further consolidate and improve the People's Communes, and actively develop commune production. While developing economic construction, continue to carry out the socialist revolution in depth, overcome the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie, and ensure the victory of the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes.
    Based on the overall task, the Congress put forward the main tasks for the development of the national economy in 1960 and determined that the main indicators and measures such as steel, coal, crude oil, grain, cotton, oil, livestock, and transportation must be completed: First of all, agricultural production must, under the premise of taking grain as the key link, conscientiously implement the policy of simultaneously expanding the cultivated land area and increasing the yield per unit area, simultaneously developing food crops and developing cash crops, and simultaneously developing agriculture and developing animal husbandry, to greatly increase grain production, ensure the needs of socialist construction and development in the Autonomous Region, and actively increase grain reserves. While greatly increasing grain production, it is necessary to actively develop cotton and other cash crops. Comprehensively and appropriately implement the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture according to local conditions, and accelerate the implementation of agricultural mechanization, water conservancy, and electrification. At the same time, under the principle of overall planning, vigorously develop the production of state-owned farms and pastures, mainly based on the Production and Construction Corps. At present, the agricultural front must especially seize the spring plowing work to ensure good planting and lay a good foundation for the realization of a great leap forward in agriculture. In animal husbandry production, it is necessary to implement the simultaneous development of large livestock and small livestock, the simultaneous development of sheep and pig raising, and the simultaneous increase in quantity and improvement in quality.
    Industrial construction must implement the policy of taking steel as the key link and simultaneously developing heavy industry and light industry. First of all, it is necessary to grasp the production and capital construction of the iron and steel industry and accelerate the development of the machinery industry in order to better equip other industries and support agriculture and transportation. Vigorously develop industries such as electricity, petroleum, coal, chemicals, non-ferrous metals, building materials, and mining, so that the various sectors of industry develop proportionally. In the development of industry, it is necessary to actively develop light industry centered on textiles and sugar making, and strive to achieve basic self-sufficiency in major light industrial products in the short term.
    To develop transportation, it is necessary to implement the policy of the whole party and the whole people running transportation and combining modern transportation tools with folk transportation tools, expand the construction of transportation, accelerate the construction of the Lanxin Railway, and especially attach importance to and grasp the construction of small foreign railways and indigenous railways. Actively develop automobile transportation. Continue to carry out the mass movement for short-distance transportation and strive to develop water transportation, air transportation, and so on.
    The meeting also discussed and determined the tasks for the continued leap forward of various undertakings such as finance and trade, education, science, culture, health, politics, and military affairs.
    The Congress emphasized that it is necessary to further consolidate and improve the People's Communes. Party committees at all levels in agricultural and pastoral areas, especially the prefectural, autonomous prefectural, and county party committees, must use their main force to firmly grasp and ensure that the work of the People's Communes is done well. The primary link in doing a good job in the People's Communes is to vigorously develop the productive forces of the People's Communes, vigorously develop production centered on agriculture (animal husbandry in pastoral areas), produce as much grain, cotton, oil, and livestock as possible, actively carry out diversified operations, and increase income to enhance the economic strength of the communes and teams. In the development of production, it is necessary to grasp both advanced communes and teams and to effectively strengthen the leadership of backward teams and poor teams, and to resolutely send strong cadres to help with the work so that they can quickly catch up with the production level of rich teams.
    The Congress believes that in order to achieve the above tasks and ensure the sustained leap forward of socialist construction in the Autonomous Region, the key lies in strengthening the leadership of the Party. And the primary issue in strengthening the leadership of the Party is to unswervingly implement the Party's General Line for socialist construction. Party committees at all levels, all departments, and all aspects of work must put politics in command. It is necessary to constantly educate cadres and the masses with the spirit of the General Line, continuously encourage hard work and strive for progress, and fully utilize the subjective initiative of the people to overcome difficulties and do everything possible to promote the high-speed development of productive forces. In order to adhere to the implementation of the General Line, it is necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership over mass movements. It is necessary to constantly strengthen political and ideological work, educate the masses with socialism and communism, and give play to the consciousness and creativity of the masses. On this basis, vigorously carry out mass movements centered on technical innovation and technical revolution, strive to accelerate semi-mechanization and mechanization, and strive to transform the level reached by advanced producers and advanced workers into the level of the broad masses. It is necessary to further improve the ideological level and leadership level of cadres and improve foresight and initiative; it is necessary to be good at analyzing the situation, studying problems, and summing up experiences, and seeing the essence and mainstream of things; it is necessary to be good at discovering new things and enthusiastically helping them. In our work, we must firmly grasp the central issues, key issues, and weak links, and we must grasp them early, deeply, and carefully. Leading cadres at all levels must follow Chairman Mao's instructions and spend more than four months a year going deep into the production teams of the People's Communes and factory and mining units to carry out work, and at the same time participate in one month of physical labor in accordance with the central government's regulations. The first secretaries of prefectural, autonomous prefectural, and county party committees should spend at least two months a year living in the People's Communes, personally guiding and studying the work of the People's Communes.
    The Congress emphasized that in order to strengthen the leadership of the Party, improve the level of leadership, improve the style of leadership, improve the methods of work, and better implement the General Line, it is necessary to strive to study Marxism-Leninism and study the works of Comrade Mao Zedong. In the study, it is necessary to link it with ideology, link it with work, transform one's world outlook, enhance Party spirit, sum up experience, study problems, improve the theoretical level and leadership level, so as to better implement the Party's General Line and promote the continuous leap forward of socialist construction.

    新疆维吾尔自治区党代会号召各族人民
    高举总路线红旗持续跃进
    本报讯　中共新疆维吾尔自治区第一届代表大会，在2月25日到3月12日召开了第二次会议，会议号召自治区全党和各族人民，更高地举起总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗，鼓足革命干劲，为完成和超额完成今年国家经济计划，实现今年更好更全面的跃进和今后的持续跃进而努力奋斗。
    代表大会分析了目前的大好形势，并提出了1960年更好更全面跃进和今后继续跃进的任务。自治区党委第一书记王恩茂同志代表自治区党委向代表大会作了工作报告。会议一致通过了关于这个工作报告的决议。会议还补选了自治区党委的委员和候补委员。最后，王恩茂同志作了会议总结。
    代表大会满意地指出，自治区党的组织和各族人民在党中央和毛主席的领导下，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，从1956年7月自治区第一届党代表大会第一次会议到第二次会议的三年半时间，特别是从1958年以来，进行了巨大的工作，完成了社会主义改造，取得了政治思想战线上社会主义革命的胜利，实现了1958年和1959年连续两年的大跃进，在很短的时间内实现了人民公社化，使自治区的国民经济出现了高速度、按比例发展的局面，各方面的建设都获得了巨大的成就。1959年自治区工农业总产值比1957年增长90％以上。最近两年牧业经济也有了很大的增长。自治区四百五十一个人民公社已走上了健全发展的道路，公社的经济有了很大的发展。两年来以生产建设兵团为主的国营农牧业经济也获得了巨大的发展，到1959年，耕地面积已经达到九百九十五万亩，比1957年增长168％。随着工农业生产建设的发展，基本建设、交通运输、财政贸易和文教科学事业，也都获得了高速度的发展，使各族人民的物质、文化生活得到了进一步的改善和提高。
    目前自治区的社会主义建设已经进入一个大发展的新阶段。在新的阶段中，自治区的任务就是更好地贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线和一整套两条腿走路的方针，持续不断地实现大跃进，坚持不懈地把自治区建设成为祖国的一个钢铁、石油、煤炭、有色金属、稀有金属、机械、纺织、制糖等工业基地和植棉基地。贯彻执行以农业为基础，在优先发展重工业的条件下，加速发展农业的方针，同时大力加强交通运输业。积极发展教育、科学文化和卫生事业，大搞技术革命和文化革命运动，大力培养科学技术干部。进一步巩固和提高人民公社，积极发展公社生产。在发展经济建设的同时，继续深入进行社会主义革命，克服资产阶级的思想影响，保证总路线、大跃进和人民公社的胜利。
    代表大会根据总的任务，提出了1960年国民经济发展的主要任务，确定了必须完成钢、煤、原油、粮食、棉花、油料、牲畜、运输等主要指标和措施：首先是农业生产必须在以粮为纲的前提下，认真执行扩大耕地面积与提高单位面积产量同时并举、发展粮食作物与发展经济作物同时并举、发展农业与发展牧业同时并举的方针，大量增产粮食，确保自治区社会主义建设发展的需要，并积极增加粮食的储备。在大量增产粮食的同时，必须积极发展棉花及其它经济作物。全面地因地制宜地贯彻农业八字宪法，加速推行农业机械化、水利化和电气化。同时在通盘规划的原则下，大力发展以生产建设兵团为主的国营农牧场的生产。当前，农业战线特别要抓紧春耕工作，保证种好，为实现农业大跃进打下良好基础。牧业生产，要实行发展大畜与发展小畜同时并举，发展养羊与发展养猪同时并举，增加数量与提高质量同时并举。
    工业建设必须贯彻执行以钢为纲和发展重工业与发展轻工业同时并举的方针。首先要抓紧钢铁工业的生产和基本建设，加快机械工业的发展，以便更好的装备其它工业，支援农业和交通运输业。要大力发展电力、石油、煤炭、化学、有色金属、建筑材料和采掘等工业，使工业各部门按比例发展。在发展工业中，要积极发展以纺织和制糖为中心的轻工业，争取在短期内作到主要轻工业产品基本自给。
    发展交通运输，必须贯彻执行全党全民办交通和现代运输工具与民间运输工具并举的方针，扩大交通运输的建设，加速兰新铁路的修建，特别要重视和抓紧小洋铁路及土铁路的修建。积极发展汽车运输。要继续开展短途运输的群众运动，并努力发展水上运输、航空运输等。
    会议还讨论和确定了财贸、教育、科学、文化、卫生、政治、军事等各项事业继续跃进的任务。
    代表大会强调指出：必须进一步巩固和提高人民公社。农牧业地区的各级党委，特别是地、州、县委要以主要力量抓紧并保证作好人民公社的工作。做好人民公社工作的首要环节，是大力发展人民公社生产力，大力发展以农业为中心（牧业区以牧业为中心）的生产，千方百计地多产粮食、棉花、油料和牲畜，积极开展多种经营，增加收入，以增强社队的经济力量。在发展生产中既要抓先进的社队，又要切实加强对落后队和穷队的领导，下决心派强的干部去帮助工作，使他们迅速赶上富队的生产水平。
    代表大会认为，为了实现上述任务，保证自治区社会主义建设的持续跃进，关键在于加强党的领导。而加强党的领导的首要问题，是坚定不移地贯彻执行党的社会主义建设的总路线。各级党委、各个部门、各方面的工作都必须政治挂帅。要经常以总路线的精神教育干部和群众，不断地鼓干劲、争上游，充分发挥人的主观能动性，战胜困难，千方百计地促进生产力高速度地向前发展。为了坚持贯彻总路线，必须加强党对群众运动的领导。要不断地加强政治思想工作，以社会主义和共产主义教育群众，发挥群众的自觉性和创造性。在这个基础上，大搞以技术革新和技术革命为中心的群众运动，努力加速半机械化和机械化，努力把先进生产者、先进工作者所达到的水平变为广大群众的水平，必须进一步提高干部的思想水平和领导水平，提高预见性和主动性；要善于分析形势，研究问题，总结经验，看清事物的本质和主流；要善于发现新生事物并且热忱地加以扶助。在工作中必须狠狠地抓紧中心问题、关键问题和薄弱环节问题，并且要抓得早，抓得深，抓得细。各级领导干部必须遵照毛主席的指示，每年应有四个月以上时间深入人民公社的生产队和厂矿单位进行工作，同时要按中央规定参加一个月的体力劳动。地、州、县委第一书记，一年内至少要有两个月左右时间住在人民公社，亲自指导和研究人民公社的工作。
    代表大会着重指出，为了加强党的领导，提高领导水平，改进领导作风和工作方法，更好地贯彻执行总路线，必须努力学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东同志的著作。在学习中，必须联系思想、联系工作，改造自己的世界观，增强党性，总结经验，研究问题，提高理论水平和领导水平，从而更好地贯彻党的总路线，促进社会主义建设事业的持续跃进。
