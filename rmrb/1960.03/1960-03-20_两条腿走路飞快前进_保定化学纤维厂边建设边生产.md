Advancing Rapidly on Two Legs
    Baoding Chemical Fiber Factory Simultaneously Constructs and Produces

    (Reported by our newspaper) The first phase of construction of China's first rayon factory—the Baoding Chemical Fiber United Factory—has been basically completed. Currently, all employees of the factory are actively preparing to put the first phase of the project entirely into production before May 1st. The second phase of the factory's capital construction project will also commence this year. Once this factory is fully completed and put into production, its annual rayon production will reach more than 70% of China's total natural silk production.

    The Baoding Chemical Fiber United Factory is being built with the assistance of the German Democratic Republic, and all of its equipment is manufactured according to the latest designs. The original design for the first phase of the factory's construction was for three years, and it was intended to be put into production all at once after completion. Encouraged by the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction, the factory adopted the policy of simultaneous construction and production, using the early start of partial production to drive the accelerated progress of the overall civil engineering and installation projects. Before "July 1st" last year, the first system of the first phase of the project was put into production, followed by the second system. Last year, the factory produced more than 400 tons of ordinary rayon, with good product quality.

    The technical strength of the Baoding Chemical Fiber United Factory is also growing daily, and while familiarizing themselves with production, they boldly accelerated the speed of the machines and improved operating methods, increasing the output per shift of the factory's spinning machines to 57.8 kilograms, exceeding the original design capacity of 52 kilograms. The production capacity of the finishing workshop has also increased by about one-fold. After the first phase of the project is put into full production this year, they plan to produce 6,000 tons of rayon using equipment designed for an annual production capacity of 5,000 tons of ordinary rayon.

    两条腿走路飞快前进
    保定化学纤维厂边建设边生产
    本报讯　我国第一座人造丝厂——保定化学纤维联合厂的第一期工程已经基本完工。目前，全厂职工正积极进行“五一”前第一期工程全部投入生产的准备工作。这个厂的第二期基建工程也将在今年开工。这个工厂全部建成投入生产以后，每年的产丝量可达到我国天然丝总产量的70％以上。
    保定化学纤维联合厂是在德意志民主共和国的帮助下建设的，它的全部设备都是按目前最新型的设计制造的。工厂的第一期工程，原设计要三年才能建设好，并且要全部建成后一次投入生产，在党的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，这个厂采取了边建设边生产的方针，以部分提前投入生产带动整个土建安装等工程加速进行。去年“七一”前，第一期工程的第一系统已经投入生产，接着第二系统也相继投入了生产。去年，这个厂已经生产出四百多吨普通人造丝，产品质量良好。
    保定化学纤维联合厂的技术力量也正在日益成长，并且在熟悉生产的同时，大胆加快了车速，改进了操作方法，使这个厂的纺丝机每台班产量超过了原设计五十二公斤的能力，达到了五十七点八公斤。整理车间的生产能力也提高一倍左右。今年第一期工程全部投入生产后，他们计划用设计能力年产五千吨普通人造丝的设备生产人造丝六千吨。（附图片）
