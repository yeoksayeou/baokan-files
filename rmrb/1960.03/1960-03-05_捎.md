    Carry along
    Carrying things for others is a help to them, and not too much trouble for oneself. This word "carry" is common in our daily lives.

    Carry-along transportation has developed on the basis of this word "carry." However, it cannot be equated with carrying things for neighbors. Because it helps not just one person or one unit; more importantly, it saves social transportation capacity, allowing the country's limited transportation equipment to be used to the fullest.

    Day and night, on the mighty Yangtze River, on the thousands of kilometers of the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, and on countless highways and short-distance transportation lines, how many trains, cars, ships, and folk transportation vehicles travel back and forth? Are these vehicles and ships fully loaded? Are there still empty trips?

    Investigate, think of more ways to widely develop carry-along transportation, so that cars don't run empty, ships don't sail empty, and everything is fully loaded. This is a quick and effective way to tap transportation potential.

    However, although it is a quick and effective method, more work must be done.

    Carrying things for neighbors is ordinary human kindness; carry-along transportation requires an overall perspective and a spirit of communist cooperation. Carrying things for others only takes a little effort; carry-along transportation is a major subject of transportation organization and loading methods: to prevent cars from running empty, it is necessary to grasp the flow of goods, compile accurate operation charts, and have flexible dispatching; to be fully loaded, light and heavy goods must be configured appropriately.

    To carry out carry-along transportation, we must do a good job in these ideological, organizational, and technical aspects.

    捎
    给人捎点东西，对别人是一种帮助，对自己也不算很麻烦。这“捎”字，在我们的日常生活中是常有的。
    捎脚运输就是在这个“捎”字的基础上发展起来的。然而，却不能把它同左邻右舍捎点东西等量齐观。因为它帮助的，不只是某一个人，某一个单位；重要的是，它节约了社会的运力，使国家有限的运输设备得到最充分的利用。
    每天每夜，在滔滔的长江上，在数千公里的京广铁路上，以及在数不清的公路和短途运输线上，不知有多少火车、汽车、轮船和民间运输车船来往不息，这些车辆船舶都是满载的吗？空驶的现象还有没有？
    查一查，多想些办法，把捎脚运输广泛开展起来，车不空跑，船不空驶，满装满载，是挖掘运输潜力的立竿见影的办法。
    但是，虽然是立竿见影的办法，也要多做工作。
    左邻右舍捎点东西，是普通人情；捎脚运输却需要整体观念，共产主义协作精神。给人捎点东西只费举手之劳；捎脚运输却是运输组织工作和装载方法的一项大学问：车不空跑要掌握货物的流向，编制准确的运行图，还要有灵活的调度；满装满载要轻重货物配置等合适。
    要开展捎脚运输，一定要做好这些思想上、组织上和技术上的工作。
