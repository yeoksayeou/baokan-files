Under the Capitalist System

    American Farmers in Dire Straits
    Due to the oppression and exploitation of American monopoly capital, the situation of American laboring farmers is becoming increasingly difficult. A United Press International reporter, when reporting on the plight of South Dakota farmer Kopfman, wrote:
  “Although he works twenty hours a day and night, last year's harvest did not meet expectations. Kopfman was finally tormented to death by debts owed for purchasing farm equipment. According to authorities, he killed his wife and two children before committing suicide.”
    The "New York Times" said that the total amount of farmers' real estate debt (including mortgage debt) increased by 6% in 1959, totaling 11.3 billion U.S. dollars. If other forms of farmer debt are included, the total debt is almost 20 billion U.S. dollars. However, the U.S. government has not taken any measures to improve the difficult situation of farmers. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Benson recently even advocated greatly reducing the prices of agricultural products.
    Great Disparity Between Rich and Poor in Britain
    A pamphlet recently published by the British Fabian Society (an organization of social reformists) said that millions of British people live in extreme poverty. The pamphlet's author, Harvey, served as a social welfare consultant in London's poorest districts for many years. He wrote that the gap between the rich and poor and the upper and lower classes in British society is widening. A small number of upper-class figures live luxuriously and corruptly, while millions cannot maintain a minimum standard of living. Now, in London alone, the number of children seeking medical treatment for malnutrition is twice as high as before World War II. At the same time, many elderly people live half-starved. There are now 1.5 million families living in poverty in Britain. The situation is even worse in Scotland, especially in Glasgow, Scotland's main industrial center, where half of the citizens live in poverty.
    The Tyranny in Greece is Fiercer Than a Tiger
    According to a recent report in the Greek newspaper "Dawn," on the island of Corfu, which is rich in oilseeds and oranges, most farmers have not been able to afford bread for many days due to the lack of sales of agricultural products and can only rely on vegetables to satisfy their hunger.
    The newspaper said that the government has adopted an attitude that disregards the lives and deaths of farmers. The Greek "Agricultural Bank" does not lend to farmers, but instead uses imprisonment to coerce farmers who are unable to repay old debts. For example, in three villages on the island of Crete with a total of only 4,000 people, the authorities issued 2,000 arrest warrants. Many farmers are forced to leave their homes and wander around. They have become targets for foreign capitalists seeking cheap labor. An immigration agency once recruited 70 young people to work as coolies in Australia, but more than 1,000 people signed up.
    New Guinea Workers Live in Hardship
    According to the "South Pacific Post," local workers in the New Guinea region under Australian rule receive pitifully low wages and live in very difficult conditions. Local workers employed by the Australian-controlled authorities receive only twelve and a half shillings every two weeks, which is roughly equivalent to the income of an Australian worker for one and a half hours of work.

    在资本主义制度下
    美国农民处境悲惨
    由于美国垄断资本的压迫掠夺，美国劳动农民的处境越来越艰难。合众国际社记者报道南达科他州的农民科普夫曼的遭遇时写道：
  “虽然他每昼夜工作达二十小时，但是去年的秋收没有达到原来的期望。科普夫曼终于被购买农具所欠下的债务折磨而死。据当局说，他是杀死了妻子和两个孩子之后自杀的。”
    “纽约时报”说，农民不动产债务（包括抵押债务）总额在1959年增长了6％，共计一百一十三亿美元。如果把农民的其他形式的欠债算进去，农民的债务就差不多达到二百亿美元。但是美国政府并没有采取任何措施来改善农民的困难处境。美国农业部长本逊最近还主张大大降低农产品的价格。
    英国社会贫富悬殊
    英国费边社（社会改良主义者的组织）最近发表的一本小册子说，数百万英国人的生活非常贫困。小册子的作者哈维曾在伦敦最贫穷区任社会瞻养顾问多年。他写道，英国社会富人和穷人及上层和下层的差别，越来越悬殊。少数上层人物奢侈腐化，千百万人不能维持最低限度的生活。现在，只是在伦敦，因营养不良患病就医的儿童人数比第二次世界大战以前多一倍。同时有许多老年人过着半饥半饱的生活。现在英国生活贫困的家庭有一百五十万个。在苏格兰，特别是在苏格兰的主要工业中心——格拉斯哥，情况更为恶劣，这里一半市民的生活是贫困的。
    希腊苛政猛于虎
    据希腊“黎明日报”最近报道，在希腊盛产油料和橘子的克基拉岛上，由于农产品没有销路，大部分农民已经有许多日子连面包也吃不上，只能靠蔬菜充饥。
    报纸说，政府采取的是一种不顾农民死活的态度。希腊的“农业银行”不贷款给农民，反而以坐牢来胁迫无力偿还旧债的农民。例如，克里特岛上的三个村子一共只有四千人，而当局发出的拘票就有二千张。许多农民被迫离乡背井，到处流浪。他们成为外国资本家寻求廉价劳动力的对象。有一个移民机构一次征募七十名青年到澳大利亚去当苦工，但报名的竟达一千多人。
    新几内亚工人生活困苦
    据“南太平洋邮报”报道，澳大利亚统治下的新几内亚地区的当地工人工资少得可怜，过着非常困苦的生活。澳大利亚人控制的当局所雇佣的当地工人每两星期只得到十二个半先令的工资，这大约只等于澳大利亚工人工作一个半小时的所得。（附图片）
