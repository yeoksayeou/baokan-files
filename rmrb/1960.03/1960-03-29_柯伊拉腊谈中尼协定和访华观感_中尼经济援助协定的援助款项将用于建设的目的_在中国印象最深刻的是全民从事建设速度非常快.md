Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 27th: According to a report from Calcutta by the Indian News Trust, Nepalese Prime Minister Koirala stated at a press conference in Calcutta on the 27th that Nepal need not feel uneasy about its border with China, "Because of the signing of the Sino-Nepalese (Border) Agreement, there is even less reason to be concerned about this issue."

Koirala arrived in Calcutta, India, on the 26th after concluding his visit to China. He also said at the press conference, "There are no border disputes between Nepal and China. I did not ask for any guarantees from the Chinese side, because this is unnecessary in Nepal's case. They have never interfered with our territory, so there is no need to raise this issue."

Koirala said that during his talks with Chinese leaders, the Chinese leaders told him that China needs peace in order to build its country, and if peace is damaged, construction will also be damaged.

Talking about the Sino-Nepalese Economic Assistance Agreement, Koirala said, "This assistance is the most willingly offered and the most willingly accepted, and this money will be used for construction purposes." He said that Nepal, which is in urgent need of assistance, has also accepted assistance from India, the Soviet Union, and the United States.

When a reporter asked what impressed him the most during his visit to China, he said that it was "the nationwide mobilization to engage in national construction. They are building very fast." He also said, "This is a striking impression for anyone who visits China."

He said that he returned with the feeling that the upcoming meeting between the Prime Ministers of China and India would produce some solution to the Sino-Indian border dispute, or at least pave the way for a friendly resolution of the issue.

Koirala said that the recently concluded Sino-Nepalese border agreement could provide a "good background" for the upcoming talks between Nehru and Zhou Enlai. That same evening, Koirala also delivered a speech at the Calcutta Gurkha Youth Federation.

    柯伊拉腊谈中尼协定和访华观感
    中尼经济援助协定的援助款项将用于建设的目的
    在中国印象最深刻的是全民从事建设速度非常快
    新华社新德里27日电　据印度报业托辣斯自加尔各答报道，尼泊尔首相柯伊拉腊27日在加尔各答举行的记者招待会上说，尼泊尔用不着为它同中国的边界感到不安，“由于中—尼（边界）协定的签订，在这个问题上产生忧虑的原因就更少了。”
    柯伊拉腊是在结束对中国的访问以后在26日到达印度加尔各答的。他在记者招待会上还说，“尼泊尔和中国之间没有边界纠纷。我并没有要求从中国方面得到任何保证，因为就尼泊尔的情况来说，这是不必要的。他们从来没有干扰过我们的领土，因此，没有必要提出这个问题。”
    柯伊拉腊说，在他同中国领导人举行会谈时，中国领导人对他说，中国需要和平，以便建设自己的国家，如果和平遭到损害，建设也就会遭到损害。
    柯伊拉腊在谈到中—尼经济援助协定时说，“这项援助是最情愿提供和最愿意接受的，这笔钱将用于建设的目的。”他说，急需要援助的尼泊尔还接受了印度、苏联和美国的援助。
    有记者问，在他访问中国期间，什么事情给他的印象最为深刻，他说，这就是“全民动员从事国家建设。他们建设得非常快”。他还说，“对于任何一个访问中国的人，这是一个突出的印象。”
    他说，他回来时有这样一种感觉，即，中印两国总理即将进行的会晤，将产生中印边境争端的某种解决办法，至少也会为友好解决这个问题铺平道路。
    柯伊拉腊说，最近缔结的中尼边界问题协定可以为尼赫鲁和周恩来即将进行的会谈提供“很好的背景”。同天晚上，柯伊拉腊还在加尔各答廓尔喀族青年联合会发表了演说。
