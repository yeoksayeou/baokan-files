Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Under the bayonets of U.S. imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique, South Korea will "elect" a puppet president on March 15th. The political situation of this "election" farce is characterized by: the deepening political crisis of the Syngman Rhee clique, increasing isolation among the people, and the daily rising anti-American and anti-Rhee sentiment of the people. In this situation, Syngman Rhee is using fascist suppression and various despicable means to ensure the election of Syngman Rhee and his accomplice Lee Ki-poong as president and vice-president. Like the past three puppet presidential "elections" in South Korea, this "election" is actually a farce of power struggles within the South Korean ruling clique. The urgent wishes of the broad masses of the South Korean people are the withdrawal of U.S. troops and the peaceful reunification of the motherland. Therefore, they deeply resent this kind of "election" farce and particularly oppose the U.S.-Rhee group.

Syngman Rhee realized long ago that his situation was getting worse and worse. Although his control over the "election" has been strengthened in each session, Syngman Rhee received fewer and fewer votes in the previous three "elections." In the most recent puppet presidential "election" in 1956, the number of votes received by Syngman Rhee dropped to 55% of the total votes. This made Syngman Rhee very panicked. Therefore, in the year or two before this "election," he successively adopted a series of fascist rule measures to ensure that he would serve as "president for life."

The Syngman Rhee group recently gave ten secret orders to the police in various places, requiring the police to ensure that the candidates of the Syngman Rhee group could receive more than 85% of the "support votes." The secret order required the police to create a list of 10% to 15% of "ghost" voters, and secretly put bundles of "support votes" accounting for more than 40% of the votes into the ballot box before voting. From March 12th to 17th, South Korea will be under special martial law. In addition to the police, a large number of military police were also dispatched to the streets, menacingly intimidating the people. The Syngman Rhee group used various sinister and vicious methods against opposition parties, especially its main opponent, the Democratic Party. Democratic Party "presidential" candidate Cho Byeong-ok "suddenly died" in Washington on February 15th, creating a situation where no one could compete with Syngman Rhee himself.

These fascist methods of the Syngman Rhee group have aroused opposition from the broad masses of the people. In recent days, demonstrations and marches by hundreds and thousands of students have taken place in Seoul, Daegu, Daejeon, Suwon, and Busan. They unanimously opposed the Syngman Rhee group's fake "election" farce, demanded fair elections, and demanded freedom and rights. According to the Toyo News Agency, this student movement may sweep across the entire South Korea.

    南朝鲜上演“选举”丑剧
    李承晚以法西斯手段支撑独裁统治
    据新华社讯  南朝鲜3月15日将在美帝国主义和李承晚集团的刺刀下“选举”伪总统，这次“选举”丑剧所处的政治形势的特点是：李承晚集团的政治危机更加深化，在人民中间更加孤立，人民的反美反李情绪逐日高涨。在这种情势下，李承晚正用法西斯镇压和各种卑鄙手段来使李承晚和他的帮凶李起鹏当选正副“总统”。像南朝鲜过去的三次伪总统“选举”一样，这次“选举”实际上是南朝鲜统治集团内部争权夺利的一场丑剧。南朝鲜广大人民目前迫切的愿望是美军撤退和和平统一祖国，因此对于这种“选举”丑剧深恶痛绝，他们特别反对美李集团。
    李承晚老早就察觉了他的处境越来越不妙。尽管他对“选举”的控制逐届加强，但是在前三次“选举”中李承晚得票越来越少。在最近一次1956年的伪总统“选举”，李承晚得到的票数跌落到选票总数的55％。这使得李承晚大为恐慌，于是，他在这次“选举”以前的一两年以来，就陆续采取了一系列法西斯统治措施，以便保证他担任“终身总统”。
    李承晚集团最近给各地警察十项密令，要警察保证李承晚集团的候选人能得到85％以上的“支持票”，密令中要警察制造10％—15％的“幽灵”选民名单，并且在投票前把假造的占选票40％以上的成捆的“支持票”秘密投入票箱。从3月12日开始到17日为止，南朝鲜全境实行特别戒严，除了警察以外，大批宪兵也出动街头，杀气腾腾，对人民进行威吓。李承晚集团对在野政党特别是他的主要对手民主党，使出了种种阴狠毒辣手段。民主党“总统”候选人赵炳玉2月15日在华盛顿“突然死去”，从而造成了无人与李承晚本人竞选的局面。
    李承晚集团这些法西斯手段，激起了广大人民的反对。连日以来，汉城、大丘、大田、水原、釜山都发生了成百上千名的学生上街示威游行的事件，他们一致反对李承晚集团的伪“选举”丑剧，要求公正的选举，要求自由权利，据东洋通讯社报道，这次学生运动可能席卷整个南朝鲜。
