A New Trend
    Zhong Yi
    Recently, a new trend has emerged in Beijing's literary and art circles: using high political enthusiasm and the fastest speed to reflect the latest and most moving events in our lives on stage and screen. For example, shortly after the publication of the news report and feature article "Hero Train," the drama "Hero Train" and "Twelve Times" appeared on the Beijing stage. After the report "For Sixty-One Class Brothers" was published in the newspaper, the Central Academy of Drama's Experimental Drama Theatre, the China Youth Art Theatre, and the Beijing Experimental Pingju Opera Troupe successively performed dramas and Pingju operas in a very short period. Teachers and students of the Central Conservatory of Music created a large chorus, the Beijing Film Studio produced a documentary art film, and the Central Broadcasting Rap Group created a large-scale Quyi Lianchang (a form of traditional Chinese folk art) "Hearts Closely Linked." The China Children's Theatre adapted and performed "Heroic Youngster Liu Wenxue" based on the deeds of the young hero Liu Wenxue. Teachers and students of the Central Academy of Drama adapted and performed the drama "Heroic Figures Today" based on the heroic deeds of the public security personnel in the Makou incident. The Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio produced the documentary "Class Brothers Connected Heart to Heart," and so on. These artistic creations, with full political enthusiasm, quickly reflected the spirit of our great era, praised the new things and new trends of socialist society, the communist style, and the great spirit of loving the people and loving the socialist motherland, giving the audience a very realistic communist education.
    At the same time, the creation process of these artistic works also demonstrated a high degree of communist collaboration and the power of collective creation. When the Party Committee of Beijing Film Studio decided to shoot "For Sixty-One Class Brothers," a film of great political significance, the best actors from the capital's theaters were sent to support it, and many units supported it with manpower and materials. The content of the film is a moving communist paean, and the filming process is also a new communist paean. It not only educates the audience, but also educates and inspires the literary and art workers themselves.
    These situations vividly demonstrate the political and artistic leaps of literary and art workers! It is the glorious and permanent task, and also the task that cannot be ignored at all times, for literary and art workers to use their works to reflect the socialist-communist spirit of the times in a timely and vivid manner; in this way, the educational role of art as a propaganda tool of the Party can be more fully brought into play!
    It is hoped that the literary and art circles will continue to promote our new trend of literature and art serving politics in a timely manner.

    新的风气
    中义
    最近以来，北京文艺界出现了一种新风气，就是在舞台和银幕上以高度的政治热情和最快的速度反映我们生活中最新最动人的事迹。像“英雄列车”的通讯和特写发表不久，北京舞台上就出现了话剧“英雄列车”和“十二次”。“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”的报道在报纸上发表后，中央戏剧学院实验话剧院和中国青年艺术剧院和北京市实验评剧团在极短的时间内，就相继演出了话剧和评剧，中央音乐学院师生创作了大合唱，北京电影制片厂摄制了一部纪录性艺术片，中央广播说唱团创作了一部大型曲艺联唱“颗颗红心紧相连”。中国儿童剧院根据少年英雄刘文学的事迹编演了“英雄少年刘文学”，中央戏剧学院师生根据马口事件公安人员的英雄事迹编演了话剧“英雄人物数今朝”，中央新闻纪录电影制片厂摄制了纪录片“阶级兄弟心连心”等。这些艺术创作以饱满的政治热情，迅速地反映了我们伟大的时代精神，歌颂了社会主义社会的新事物、新风气，共产主义的风格和热爱人民、热爱社会主义祖国的伟大精神，给了观众极现实的共产主义教育。
    同时，这些艺术作品的创作过程，也表现了高度的共产主义协作精神和集体创作的力量。北京电影制片厂党委决定拍摄“为了六十一个阶级弟兄”这部有重大政治意义的片子的时候，首都各剧院派出最优秀的演员来支援，许多单位支援了人力物力。影片的内容是一首动人的共产主义的凯歌，而拍摄过程同样也是一曲新的共产主义凯歌。它不只是教育观众，也教育着和鼓舞着文艺工作者自己。
    这些情况生动地显示了文艺工作者政治上和艺术上的跃进！文艺工作者，用自己的作品及时、生动地反映社会主义——共产主义的时代精神，是光荣而永久的任务，也是时时不可忽视的任务；这样就更能充分发挥作为党的宣传工具的艺术的教育作用！
    希望文艺界继续发扬我们的文艺及时为政治服务的新的风气。
