    Mobile Weather Stations
    Recently, a group of mobile weather stations appeared on the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, helping herdsmen transmit weather information and overcome natural disasters.
    The staff of these mobile weather stations, carrying radio stations and meteorological instruments, went deep into the snow-covered spring pastures. Combining the weather information received from various central meteorological stations on the same day with local weather changes, they made weather forecasts for the area for the next 24 or 36 hours. Through messengers, the information was quickly transmitted to various pastures, helping herdsmen arrange production and overcome spring snowstorms on the grasslands. A weather station active on the West Ujimqin Banner pasture in Xilin Gol League recently predicted a heavy snowfall in the Hana Ula Mountains to the people's commune in advance. More than a week later, more than two feet of snow fell on the eastern foot of the Hana Ula Mountains. At this time, the herdsmen of a neighboring commune thought that a large number of livestock here were affected by the disaster, so they came to support them, but when they arrived in the snow area, there was no trace of people or animals. It turned out that more than 110,000 livestock grazing in the Hana Ula Mountains had already been moved to pastures more than 100 miles away before the snowfall.
    The mobile weather stations were dispatched by the central weather stations of the grasslands and set up in relatively remote pastures to better help herdsmen overcome spring snowstorms. Now, six mobile weather stations have appeared on the grasslands of the autonomous region, coupled with the original 123 weather stations (posts), forming a strong weather network, which has become an important tool for herdsmen to arrange production and overcome natural disasters. Last winter, the herdsmen of Xilin Gol Grassland received weather information that there would be little snow in the winter on the grassland, so they launched a winter well digging campaign on the pasture, and dug more than 2,000 new wells in one winter. Although there was very little snow in winter, the livestock still had water to drink.

    流动气象台
    内蒙古草原上，不久前出现了一批流动气象台，帮助牧民传递气象情报，战胜自然灾害。
    这些流动气象台的工作人员，携带着无线电台和气象仪器，深入到白雪皑皑的春季牧场，把当天从各中心气象台收到的气象情报，结合当地气象变化做出所在地区未来二十四小时或三十六小时内的气象情报，通过传递员，迅速传送到各个牧场，帮助牧民安排生产，战胜草原春季风雪。活跃在锡林郭勒草原西乌珠穆沁旗牧场上的一个气象台，不久前把这里哈娜乌拉山区降大雪的情报，事先预报给人民公社。过了一个多星期，哈娜乌拉山东麓，下了二尺多深的雪。这时，邻近公社的牧民，认为这里的大批牲畜受灾了，就前来支援，可是一到雪区，人畜无踪影，原来在哈娜乌拉山区放牧的十一万多头牲畜，下雪前就已经移到一百多里外的牧场上去了。
    流动气象台，是为了更好地帮助牧民战胜春季风雪，由草原各中心气象台派出去，设立在比较偏僻的牧场上的。现在自治区草原上出现了六个流动气象台，加上原有一百二十三个气象台（站），形成了一个强有力的气象网，成为牧民安排生产，战胜自然灾害的一个重要工具。锡林郭勒草原牧民，去年入冬时接到了草原上冬季雪少的气象情报，就在牧场上开展打冬井运动，一冬天打了二千多眼新井，冬季虽然下雪很少，牲畜仍然喝到了水。
