    Increase Fat Reserves, Ensure Pregnancy, and Breed More Livestock
    Xinjiang, Henan, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang Seize the Opportunity to Hasten Spring Mating
    Xinjiang Strives for a Net Increase of 10 Percent in Horses and Cattle
    Our Newspaper, Urumqi, 9th Dispatch: Party and government leaders in the vast pastoral areas of Xinjiang are vigorously promoting the development of large livestock, striving to achieve a net increase rate of over 10% for horses and cattle this year.
    Xinjiang's pastoral areas currently have more than two million head of horses and cattle. The Ili horses and Yanqi horses produced here are beloved by people of all ethnic groups. According to historical records, as early as the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, 2,100 years ago, Ili horses were introduced to the Guanzhong area for development and breeding. In order to greatly develop large livestock, people's communes have established specialized horse and cattle production teams based on the reorganization of livestock herds, concentrating over 80% of breeding female livestock for centralized management, grazing in separate groups, and meticulous feeding. While accelerating the development of horse and cattle production, various localities have also widely promoted artificial insemination and crossbreeding to improve breeds. This year, the conception rate of horses and cattle in pastoral and semi-agricultural-pastoral areas is higher than in any previous year, generally above 80%. The number of crossbreeding improvements has also greatly increased. According to statistics from counties directly under the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, more than 60% of the eligible breeding female livestock have undergone crossbreeding improvement.
    In terms of the selection, breeding, and feeding management of breeding male livestock, people's communes in various localities generally adopted three methods: First, vigorously carry out local breed selection and breeding, mobilizing experienced commune members to select excellent local breeding male livestock from among the local breeds. Second, breeding male livestock used for labor in agricultural areas are supplied by pastoral areas, and castrated horses and steers are replaced and managed centrally. At present, communes and pastures in Yanqi Hui Autonomous County, the origin of Yanqi horses, have replaced half of the breeding horses and cattle used in agriculture. Third, breeding male livestock have been rationally allocated, overcoming the uneven distribution of breeding livestock before communization. After rational allocation and use of breeding livestock by communes in Qitai County, each team has breeding livestock, and each herd has sufficient breeding livestock. On average, there is one breeding male livestock and reserve breeding male livestock for every seventeen eligible breeding female horses and fourteen eligible breeding female cattle. This has changed the previous backward practice of large-group natural mating to small-group mating, enabling the conception rate of horses and cattle in the county to reach over 90%. Now that the season for foaling and calving on the grasslands is approaching, people's communes and state-owned ranches are actively preparing for the transfer to spring pastures and the reception of young livestock, striving for a bumper harvest.
    Henan: 88 Percent of Eligible Breeding Female Livestock are Pregnant
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou: The number of breeding female livestock mated in Henan Province in January and February accounted for 43% of the eligible open breeding female livestock. Adding the original pregnant livestock, the number of pregnant livestock now accounts for 88% of the eligible breeding female livestock in the province.
    Various localities in Henan generally launched a winter mating campaign last winter. This spring, they started early again to carry out spring mating work. Yanling and eight other counties organized more than 60,000 people to go deep into production team feeding rooms and fields to check the estrus and mating of breeding female livestock. They implemented artificial induction of estrus for eligible breeding female livestock and mated 11,176 head within four days. Deng County, Zhenping, Xichuan, and five other counties organized 6,000 professional teams to check, induce estrus, and mate simultaneously. The large livestock mated in January accounted for more than 90% of the eligible open breeding female livestock.
    Various localities vigorously promoted dual mating and repeat mating techniques. More than one-quarter of the breeding female livestock mated in the province during the winter were subjected to dual mating and repeat mating. Last year, 58 breeding female livestock in Maoji People's Commune in Tongbai County underwent dual mating, with two giving birth to triplets and 38 giving birth to twins. Changge County established high-yield experimental fields for large livestock at each level. The county party committee designated two communes as one-mother-two-birth communes, and each commune designated 15 one-mother-two-birth teams. The brigade also cultivated 644 one-mother-two-birth troughs, which powerfully promoted this advanced experience.
    In order to improve the quality of livestock, various localities selected many excellent breeding livestock from local livestock to mate with breeding female livestock, based on the principle of "selecting the best from local breeds." Among them, the most popular excellent breeding livestock among the masses are Nanyang Yellow Cattle, Biyang Donkeys, and Fugou Improved Horses. The province has designated 23 counties, including Nanyang, Biyang, Yancheng, and Fugou, as breeding bases for good livestock breeds. During spring mating, these good livestock breed bases actively supported areas with insufficient breeding livestock. Nanyang County alone transferred more than 1,200 head of breeding cattle. The province also selected 28 mountainous counties with more grazing slopes, such as Luanchuan, Lushan, and Tongbai, as breeding bases for large livestock, vigorously breeding draft animals to support other areas.
    While vigorously carrying out mating work, various localities have conscientiously strengthened the work of protecting pregnant female livestock and raising young livestock. Changge County established 276 maternity wards for breeding female livestock, implementing separate feeding and meticulous care for 5,800 breeding female livestock in the eighth month of pregnancy or later, protecting pregnancy and production, ensuring the safety of breeding female livestock production, and ensuring the survival of young livestock after birth. Zhangzhuang Commune in Shangshui County allowed breeding female livestock to rest for three days during mating and three to seven days before and after delivery. Usually, pregnant livestock are appropriately reduced in labor, and cold whips are not used when working, and steep bends are avoided, striving to prevent miscarriage of pregnant livestock.
    Heilongjiang Promotes the "One Horse Mates 3,000" Experience
    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin: In the spring mating of livestock, rural areas in Heilongjiang Province are widely promoting the successful experience of "One Horse Mates 3,000." This experience was created by the Shuangcheng County suburban mating station. The method mainly involves strengthening the feeding management of breeding male horses; close combination of the mating station, the insemination network, and the insemination station to ensure timely mating. At the same time, the dilution ratio of semen is changed. Therefore, this mating station mated a total of 2,975 mares with one stallion during the 204-day mating period in 1959, with a conception rate of 73.9%, doubling the mating rate compared with 1958.
    The emergence of this mating experience aroused widespread attention from party organizations at all levels and the masses in Heilongjiang Province, and it was quickly promoted throughout the province.
    When promoting the mating experience of "One Horse Mates 3,000," various localities have strengthened the work of artificial insemination stations and the feeding management of breeding male horses. Zhaodong County has trained more than 300 inseminators and established 15 mating stations and 2,054 insemination points. Due to the addition of grass and feed to stallions and timely exercise, the semen density has been greatly improved. Baiquan County has set up a central mating station and 12 branch stations according to the distribution of mares, and adopted the method of field inspection, semen delivery to points, and trough mating, so that mares can be mated in a timely manner. Ainong Commune in this county has already had 1,506 mares pregnant after adopting early spring mating.
    Liaoning: The Conception Rate of Large Livestock Greatly Exceeds Last Year
    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang: In order to realize this year's great leap forward plan for large livestock, various localities in Liaoning are carrying out a vigorous mass movement to increase fat reserves and ensure pregnancy of large livestock.
    Since the province launched the large livestock fat increase and pregnancy campaign in early January this year, the number of first- and second-class fat livestock has risen to 85%, and the number of third-class fat livestock has dropped from about 25% to 15%. Fuxin, Zhangwu, Heishan, and other counties have basically eliminated third-class fat livestock, achieving full and strong fat reserves for each head. The general increase in fat reserves and upgrading of large livestock has created favorable conditions for the full mating, full accuracy, full birth, full survival, and full strength of eligible breeding female livestock. In addition, various artificial estrus induction methods were generally adopted this year, and the mating work of large livestock in the province started one month earlier than in previous years. By the end of February, more than 200,000 head of eligible breeding female livestock such as horses, cattle, and donkeys had been mated in the province, an increase of four to five times compared with the same period last year, and the conception situation is also very good.
    In order to make a great development of large livestock this year, party committees at all levels have greatly strengthened the leadership of large livestock breeding and reproduction work, just like grasping agriculture and pig breeding. All cities and counties have established livestock production committees or livestock leading groups, with secretaries taking the lead at each level to carry out mass movements. In order to promote the in-depth development of the fat increase and pregnancy campaign, the Dalian Municipal Party Committee specially convened a meeting of secretaries in charge of animal husbandry in various counties, made specific arrangements, and organized a thousand-person inspection team to go deep into the grassroots to inspect and promote.
    In the fat increase and pregnancy campaign, various localities have established and improved the feeding management system and further strengthened the work of preventing cold and protection. According to incomplete statistics, more than 180,000 livestock houses have been newly built and repaired in the province in January, basically achieving the requirements of having a house for each livestock and keeping warm and preventing cold.
    Various localities have also adopted methods such as digging, finding, picking, manufacturing, and threshing the fields one more time to store rich feed for large livestock. Heishan County alone collected more than 125 million catties of various agricultural by-products.
    In order to further improve the feeding management of livestock, Changtu, Heishan, Fuxin, Zhangwu, and other counties generally implemented classification, grouping, separate feeding, and individual care management methods according to the type, gender, and health of livestock. Grass and feed are added to sick, weak, old, young, and pregnant livestock, and feeding methods such as refining coarse feed, cooking and grinding, feeding warm grass and warm feed, and drinking warm water are promoted to quickly improve livestock fat reserves. Each commune in Andong County has also established 14 livestock sanatoriums, selecting experienced feeders to carefully feed the livestock, so that more than 500 sick and weak livestock admitted to the sanatorium quickly recovered their health.

    增膘满怀更多繁殖大牲畜
    新疆、河南、辽宁、黑龙江利用时机抓紧春配
    新疆力争马牛纯增百分之十
    本报乌鲁木齐9日电　新疆广大牧区党政领导正狠抓大牲畜的发展，力争今年马、牛净增率达到10％以上。
    新疆牧区现有马牛二百多万头，所产的伊犁马、焉耆马都为各族人民喜爱。据历史记载，伊犁马早在二千一百年前的汉武帝时代，就到了关中一带发展繁殖。为大量发展大牲畜，各人民公社已经在整编畜群的基础上，建立起了马牛生产的专业队，把80％以上的生产母畜集中管理，分群牧放，精心饲养。各地在加速发展马牛生产的同时，还普遍推广了人工授精和杂交改良品种。今年牧区和半农半牧区马牛的受胎率高出以往任何一年，一般都在80％以上。杂交改良的数量也大大增加，据伊犁哈萨克族自治州直属各县的统计，马牛进行杂交改良的占适龄母畜60％以上。
    在种公畜的选育和饲养管理方面，各地人民公社一般都采取了三种办法：一是大搞土种选育，发动有经验的社员在当地土种公畜中选择优良的土种公畜。二是把在农业区役使的种公畜由牧业区供应，把骟马，阉牛抽替下来，集中管理。目前焉耆马产地焉耆回族自治县的各公社、牧场，已经把农业上使用的种马、种牛，有半数抽替下来。三是合理调剂了种公畜，克服了公社化前种畜分布不平衡的状况。奇台县各公社经过合理调剂使用种畜后，作到了队队有种畜、群群种畜足，平均十七匹适龄母马和十四头适龄母牛就有一头种公畜和后备种公畜，因此改变了过去落后的大群自然交配为小群配种，使全县马牛的受胎率达到90％以上。现在，草原上产驹、产犊的季节即将到来，各人民公社、国营牧场正积极作好转移春牧场和接产幼畜的准备工作，力争大丰收。
    河南适龄母畜怀胎达百分之八十八
    新华社郑州讯　河南省1、2两个月份配种的母畜已占适龄空怀母畜43％；加上原有的孕畜，现在怀孕的母畜已达全省适龄母畜88％。
    河南各地去年冬季就普遍开展冬季配种运动。今春又及早动手，开展春配工作。鄢陵等八个县，组织六万多人，深入生产队饲养室和田间，检查母畜发情和配种情况，对适龄母畜实行人工催情，四天之内就配种一万一千一百七十六头。邓县、镇平、淅川等五个县组织专业队六千个，边检查、边催情、边配种，1月份配种的大家畜占适龄空怀母畜90％以上。
    各地大力推行了双配和复配技术。全省冬季配种的母畜，双配和复配的占四分之一以上。桐柏县毛集人民公社去年五十八头母畜实行双配，有两头一胎生三仔，三十八头一胎生二仔。长葛县逐级建立大家畜高产试验田，县委确定两个公社为大家畜一母双胎社，各公社确定了十五个一母双胎队，大队又培养了六百四十四个一母双胎槽，有力地推广了这一先进经验。
    为了提高牲畜质量，各地根据“土中选优”的原则，从当地牲畜中挑选出了许多优良种畜为母畜配种。其中，最受群众欢迎的优良种畜有南阳黄牛、泌阳驴、扶沟改良马等。全省已确定以南阳、泌阳、郾城、扶沟等二十三个县为牲畜的良种繁殖基地。在春配中，这些牲畜良种基地都积极支持种畜不足的地区，仅南阳县就调出种牛一千二百多头。全省还选定栾川、鲁山、桐柏等二十八个牧坡较多的山区县为大家畜繁殖基地，大力繁殖耕畜，支援外地。
    在大力开展配种工作同时，各地认真加强了母畜保胎和仔畜养护工作。长葛县建立母畜临产院二百七十六处，对怀胎八个月以上的五千八百头母畜实行分槽喂养、精心护理、保胎保产，使母畜生产安全，仔畜产后保活。商水县张庄公社在母畜配种时，让它休息三天，产前产后休息三至七天。平时，孕畜适当减轻劳役、干活时不打冷鞭和不拐陡弯，力争孕畜不流产。
     黑龙江推广“一马配三千”经验
    据新华社哈尔滨讯　黑龙江省农村在牲畜春季配种中，广泛推广“一马配三千”的成功经验。这一经验是双城县城郊配种站创造的。办法主要是加强种马的饲养管理；由配种站、输精网、输精站三者密切结合，保证及时配种。同时，改变精液稀释倍数。因此，这个配种站在1959年二百零四天配种期中，一匹种马共配母马二千九百七十五匹，受胎率73．9％，比1958年提高配种率两倍。
    这项配种经验一出现，引起黑龙江省各级党组织和广大群众普遍的重视，迅速在全省推广。
    各地在推广“一马配三千”的配种经验时，都加强了人工配种站的工作和种公马的饲养管理。肇东县已训练出配种员三百多名，建立了十五个配种站、二千零五十四个输精点。由于对种马加草加料、适时运动，使精液密度大大提高。拜泉县根据母马分布情况，设立了一处中心配种站和十二处分站，并采取地头检查，送精到点，槽头配种的方法，使母马及时配种。这个县的爱农公社采取早春配种后，已有一千五百零六匹母马满怀。
    辽宁大家畜受胎大超去年
    新华社沈阳讯　辽宁各地为实现今年大牲畜跃进规划，正在开展轰轰烈烈的大牲畜增膘满怀的群众运动。
    全省大牲畜从今年1月初各地大搞大牲畜增膘满怀运动以来，一、二类膘已经上升到85％，三类膘由25％左右下降到15％。阜新、彰武、黑山等县大牲畜已基本消灭了三类膘，达到了头头膘满体壮。大牲畜的普遍增膘升级，为适龄母畜的全配、全准、全生、全活、全壮创造了有利条件，加上今年各地普遍采用各种人工催情的办法，全省大牲畜的配种工作比往年提早一个月开始。到2月底止，全省马、牛、驴等适龄母畜已有二十多万头配了种，比去年同期增加了四、五倍，受胎情况也十分良好。
    为了使今年大牲畜来个大发展，各级党委都像抓农业和养猪业一样，大力加强了对大牲畜饲养繁殖工作的领导。各市、县都成立了畜牧业生产委员会或畜牧业领导小组，层层书记挂帅，大搞群众运动。中共旅大市委为了推动增膘满怀运动的深入开展，专门召开了各县分管畜牧业的书记会议，作了具体布置，并组织了千人检查团，深入基层检查推动。
    在增膘满怀运动中，各地都建立与健全了饲养管理制度，进一步加强防寒保护工作。据不完全统计，全省在1月份里新建和补修的畜舍就有十八万多间，基本上达到有畜就有舍和保温防寒的要求。
    各地还采取挖、找、拣、制和多打一遍场等办法，为大牲畜储备了丰富的饲料。仅黑山一县就搜集各种农业副产物一亿二千五百多万斤。
    为了进一步改善牲畜的饲养管理，昌图、黑山、阜新、彰武等县，根据牲畜种类、性别和健康情况，普遍实行了分类、分群、分槽饲养和个别照顾的管理方法。对病、弱、老、幼、孕畜加草加料，并且推行粗料细作、煮熟磨细、喂暖草暖料和饮温水等喂养方法，使牲畜膘迅速好转。安东县各公社还建立了十四处牲畜疗养院，选择经验丰富的饲养员精心饲养，使入院的五百多头患病体弱的牲畜很快恢复了健康。
