Xinhua News Agency, 18th. The Beijing football team beat the Soviet Moscow "Spartak" football team 1-0 today at the Beijing Workers' Stadium. The only goal was scored six minutes before the end of the first half, when right-back Wang Defa scored a powerful direct free kick from 20 meters away from the opponent's goal, past goalkeeper Boganin.

This was the first international friendly football match held in Beijing this year. During the match, the competition was very fierce, and the wonderful performances of the two teams' players frequently won warm applause and cheers from tens of thousands of spectators. The visiting team, in a tenacious counterattack, had three excellent scoring opportunities in the second half, two of which were shots at an open goal, and one was a penalty kick. However, the shots were all cleared by Beijing team players in time. Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Chen Yi, Mayor of Beijing Peng Zhen, and others watched the game, and after the game, accompanied by Antonov, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Soviet Embassy in China, met the athletes of both sides on the field and took a group photo.

The Soviet Moscow "Spartak" football team has won the All-Soviet Football League championship seven times. Before coming to Beijing this time, they had held friendly matches with four other Chinese football teams in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, and other places, achieving three wins and one draw. In these matches, they had fielded two completely different lineups. Most of the players who played today were young and fast-rising stars. The Beijing team played today with a combination of old and new players, including veterans such as Cong Zheyu (right winger), Chen Jialiang (right inside forward), Zhang Jingtian (center forward), and Sun Baorong (center back), as well as newcomers such as Zhang Kunyue (left inside forward) and Zhao Liji (left back).

In the first half, the Beijing team played actively and proactively, with both the forwards and backs being very active. The offense was frequent, and the defense was tight. They had many opportunities to shoot, but most of the shots were either off target or caught by the opponent's goalkeeper. It was not until the 39th minute that the situation on the field changed due to a direct free kick opportunity.

In the second half, the "Spartak" team adjusted its lineup and replaced four players in a row. The four new players were goalkeeper Ivanov, right winger Mishin, center forward Granov, and left midfielder Ggofek. The visiting team launched a sharp offensive, passing the ball quickly, attacking from the right and breaking through the middle. The Beijing team's goal was repeatedly in danger. In the 15th and 25th minutes, Xu Fusheng ran out to save the ball twice, fortunately, Zhang Jingtian and Zhao Liji rushed to the goal to make timely saves, preventing the opponent from scoring.

Then came the most tense scene: Zhao Liji committed a handball foul while saving, resulting in a penalty kick. Xu Fusheng accurately used his foot to block the ball kicked by the visiting team's right inside forward Pogorelnikov outside the goal.

The Beijing team then launched a series of attacks, but they failed to score again.

The Soviet Moscow "Spartak" football team will soon leave Beijing for a visit to Tianjin, preparing to hold friendly matches with the Tianjin football team and the Shenyang football team on the 20th and 22nd respectively. (Photo attached)

    斯巴达克和北京足球队举行友谊赛
    北京队以一比零胜斯巴达克足球队
    周总理等观看了球赛并接见双方运动员
    新华社18日讯　北京足球队今天在北京工人体育场以一比零战胜了苏联莫斯科
  “斯巴达克”足球队。这个唯一得分的球，是上半场结束前六分钟，由右后卫王德发在离对方球门二十米外主罚直接任意球时，劲射入客队波岗宁把守的球门的。
    这是今年以来在北京举行的第一场国际足球友谊赛。比赛过程中，双方争夺十分激烈，两队队员的精采表演不时博得数万名观众的热烈掌声和欢呼声。顽强反攻的客队在下半场获得了三次极好的得分机会，其中两次是射空门，一次是罚十一米球。但射出的球都被北京队的队员及时地解救了。周恩来总理、陈毅副总理、北京市市长彭真等观看了这场球赛，并且在球赛结束后由苏联驻华大使馆临时代办安东诺夫陪同，到球场上接见了双方运动员，并一起合影。
    苏联莫斯科“斯巴达克”足球队曾经七次获得全苏足球联赛的冠军。这次在来北京以前，曾先后在上海、杭州、广州等地同我国其他四个足球队举行了友谊比赛，获得三胜一平的战绩。在这几场比赛中，他们曾经排出两种截然不同的阵容。今天上场的队员大部都是年纪轻、速度快的后起之秀。北京队今天则是新老队员搭配出场，其中包括从者余（右边锋）、陈家亮（右内锋）、张京天（中锋）、孙宝荣（中卫）等老将，以及张坤岳（左内锋）、赵利基（左后卫）等新手。
    上半场北京队踢得积极主动，锋、卫都很活跃，攻势频繁，防守严密。他们曾多次获得射门机会，可是大部分球都射偏或被对方守门员接住。直到第三十九分钟时，由于获得罚直接任意球的机会，才使场上的情况发生了变化。
    下半场“斯巴达克”队调整了阵容，连续换了四个队员，新上场的四人是守门员伊万诺夫、右边锋米辛、中锋格拉诺夫和左前卫格戈费克。客队展开锐利攻势，他们传球快速，一会儿由右路进攻，一会儿由中路突破，北京队球门前屡出险象。第十五和第二十五分钟时，徐福生先后两次跑出扑球落空，幸好张京天和赵利基及时跑到球门前补位抢救，才没有被对方把球攻入球门。
    接着又出现了最紧张的场面：赵利基补位抢救时上臂碰球犯规，被罚十一米球。徐福生以准确的动作用脚把客队右内锋波哥里尼科夫踢来的球挡在球门以外。
    北京队随后也展开了一连串的进攻，但他们没能再次把球攻入对方球门。
    苏联莫斯科“斯巴达克”足球队即将离北京去天津访问，准备20日和22日先后同天津足球队和沈阳足球队举行友谊比赛。（附图片）
