    Jiangbei Commune's Complete Set of Innovative Cotton Planting Tools
    22 New Tools Developed, Over 7,000 Pieces Promoted and Used
    (By our newspaper) Jiangxi's cotton production red banner - Pengze County's Jiangbei Commune vigorously carried out technical innovation, comprehensively reforming cotton farming tools, so that all the main processes of cotton production in the commune had advanced tools or improved farm implements.
    At present, the commune has successfully created, modified, and imitated 22 kinds of advanced tools, and more than 7,500 pieces have been promoted and used. These new tools generally improve work efficiency by five to twenty times compared to manual operation, and also have the advantages of simple operation and low cost. For example, a weeding machine costs less than two yuan, and one person and one cow can weed 40 mu of cotton fields per day, which is 20 times more efficient than manual weeding and greatly reduces labor intensity. After the promotion and use of the above-mentioned new tools, the commune can save 1.5 million labor days a year.
    Jiangbei Commune's reform of cotton production tools started with the pest control process. In past cotton production, the pest control process consumed a lot of labor. During the cotton growing season, the commune's more than 20,000 mu of cotton fields required 70,000 labor days per month to spray pesticides for pest control. Therefore, the commune's Party committee mobilized commune members to first reform spraying tools. The commune's Party committee also used Jiangxin Brigade as a pilot, specifically helping commune members Wen Zhisheng and others create an automatic double-headed sprayer. This sprayer automatically sprays mist from two heads. One person can operate one unit to spray 10 mu of cotton fields per day, which is 10 times more efficient than manual spraying in the past. The commune's Party committee seized this typical example, organized commune members to visit and hold on-site meetings to expand influence and educate the masses. After the masses were further mobilized, the commune's Party committee took advantage of the situation to guide the masses to immediately reform sowing tools, which required a lot of labor in cotton production. In less than three days, a sowing machine that was 15 times more efficient than manual sowing was successfully created. One person operating one sowing machine can sow 15 mu of cotton fields per day, and it is easy to use, which is very popular among commune members.
    After the new sowing tools were innovated, the old tools for leveling cotton fields and row marking could not keep up with the needs of sowing. The commune's Party committee further mobilized commune members to comprehensively innovate tools for each process. In order to make the matching fast and good, the method of "local creation, learning from other places, and joint matching" was adopted, that is: 1. For new tools created in other places but also suitable for the local area, organize imitation; 2. For new tools created in other places and basically usable in the local area, organize modification; 3. For tools that are not available in other places but are urgently needed locally, create them yourself; 4. The whole commune cooperates, the skilled workers and craftsmen of the teams and the commune members cooperate to create and jointly match. For example, the innovation of the four tools in the sowing process, such as leveling the soil, row marking, sowing, and fertilizing, was organized by everyone and done collectively. Since last year, under the slogan of "Everyone contributes ingenious ideas, everyone engages in creation," more than 200 "living Lubans" and "surpassing Zhuge Liangs" have emerged in the commune. Commune members have contributed more than 2,000 ideas and created 11 new tools such as soil loosening machines, weeding and cultivating machines, and stalk pulling machines. At the same time, more than 100 technicians were sent to other places to learn and obtain treasures, and 12 new tools such as soil cultivating machines, two-wheeled vehicles, and towed sailboats were imitated and modified, thereby comprehensively reforming cotton production tools from point to surface, so that there were corresponding new tools for each process and each agricultural activity within each process, and the work efficiency of each process was improved.

### 江北公社成套革新植棉工具  已有新工具二十二种，推广使用七千多件

    江北公社成套革新植棉工具
    已有新工具二十二种，推广使用七千多件
    本报讯　江西棉花生产红旗——彭泽县江北公社大闹技术革新，成套地改革了棉花耕作工具，使全社棉花生产的各个主要工序都有了先进工具或改良农具。
    现在全社已创制、改制、仿制成功二十二种先进工具，已推广使用七千五百多件。这些新工具一般比手工操作提高工效五倍至二十倍，而且具有操作简便、成本低廉等优点。如一架锄草机，成本不到二元，一人一条牛每天能锄棉花四十亩，比人工锄草提高工效二十倍，并大大减轻了劳动强度。推广使用上述各种新工具后，全社一年可节省劳动日一百五十万个。
    江北公社改革棉花生产工具是从治虫工序开始的。历年棉花生产中，喷药治虫工序花费的劳力很多，在棉花生长期间全社二万多亩棉花，每月要花七万个劳动日为棉苗喷药治虫。因此，公社党委发动社员，首先改革喷药工具。公社党委又以江心大队为试点，具体帮助社员闻志生等创制了自动双头喷雾器。这种喷雾器两头自动喷射药雾，一人操纵，一部每天可喷药十亩棉地，比过去人工喷药提高工效十倍。公社党委抓住这一典型事例，组织全社社员参观、开现场会，扩大影响，教育群众。群众进一步发动起来后，公社党委就趁热打铁，引导群众紧接改革棉花生产花劳力较多的播种工具。不到三天，一种比人工播种提高工效十五倍的播种机创制成功了，一人操作一部播种机，每天播种十五亩棉田，而且使用轻巧，极受社员欢迎。
    新的播种工具革新以后，使用旧有的平整棉田、划行等工具远远跟不上播种的需要。公社党委就进一步发动社员成套革新各个工序的工具。为了使配套做到又快又好，采取了“本地创造、外地取经、联合配套”的办法，即是：一、外地创制而本地又适用的新工具，便组织仿制；二、外地创制，本地基本能用的新工具，便组织改制；三、外地没有、本地又急需的工具，便自己创制；四、全社协作，队与队的能工与巧匠、社员与社员合作创制，联合配套。如播种工序内的平土、划行、播种、施肥等四项工具革新，就是组织大家的力量，集体搞成的。从去年以来，全社在“人人献妙计、个个搞创造”的口号下，涌现了二百多个“活鲁班”、“赛诸葛”，社员献计献策二千多条，创制松土机、除草中耕器、拔秆工具机等新工具十一种；与此同时，派出了一百多名技术人员到外地取经、取宝，仿制、改装培土机、双轮车、拖帆船等新工具十二种，从而由点到面地成套改革了棉花生产工具，使工序与工序，每个工序内的各项农活之间都有了相应的新工具，道道工序提高了工效。（附图片）
