Turning Wind Harm into Wind Benefit
Baicheng People Widely Use Wind Power to Serve Agriculture

    (Our report) Baicheng area people fighting against wind hazards have issued the bold statement: "Wind passing through Baicheng must work for us." Now this area already possesses more than one thousand eight hundred windmills of various types used for lifting water, driving machinery and generating electricity. On average, each commune has nineteen windmills, and every management district utilizes wind power to serve agricultural production and rural life.
    In the past, the Baicheng area suffered from wind and sand disasters year after year. The strong winds blowing from the southwest and northwest directions often caused phenomena such as crop destruction, missing seedlings, and crop lodging in various counties. The wind also blew sand dunes, covering fertile land. In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, the people of this area have launched a tenacious struggle against wind, sand, and drought, planting trees on a large scale to prevent wind and fix sand, while also vigorously developing water conservancy to control drought, achieving remarkable results and greatly reducing the threat of wind, sand, and drought.
    On this basis, the Baicheng Prefectural Party Committee led the masses to further utilize wind power to transform nature. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, they put forward the slogan "Turn wind harm into wind benefit" and mobilized the masses to widely manufacture and use windmills. In order to adapt to the current rural economic situation, the Prefectural Party Committee adopted the principles of "small-scale as the main focus, commune-run as the main focus, production as the main focus" and "using indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, adapting to local conditions, using local materials, and simplifying as much as possible." They also established the principle of "popularizing first and then improving, improving on the basis of popularization, and popularizing under the guidance of improvement," which enabled windmills to develop rapidly. Initially, most of the windmills promoted in various places were small 55-type windmills with only two horsepower. Gradually, they developed from small to large, and the types increased. Now, they have self-designed and manufactured 3-22 type giant wind turbines with a tower height of fifteen meters and a wind wheel diameter of twenty-two meters. This type of windmill can be operated indoors, using electricity to adjust the direction and speed, and has one hundred and twenty-three horsepower. The use of windmills has also developed from simply lifting water for irrigation to comprehensive utilization in many aspects, such as pushing stone mills, pulling grinders, cutting grass, threshing grain, sifting grain and rice, and generating electricity.
    When trial-producing windmills, local Party committees adopted the method of "debating until ideological problems are resolved, visiting if you don't understand, learning if you can't, and working once you've learned," thoroughly criticizing conservative thinking and quickly emerging a large number of skilled craftsmen from the masses. For example, the 3-22 type power generating windmill, which is currently the largest in China, was successfully trial-produced by the Tao'an County Machinery Iron Factory, which only has more than one hundred and twenty workers. This windmill far exceeded the machining load capacity of the factory's machine tools. However, the workers displayed a spirit of daring to think and daring to act, boldly inverting and raising the machine tools for processing, and finally succeeded. Gu Wanhai, the director of the Shuanghe Management District of the Rangzi Commune in Qian'an County, who originally didn't even know how to measure, created six methods with the assistance of several carpenters, including using windmills to drive stone mills, push grinders, sift grain, cut vegetables, peel corn, and thresh, all of which were successful. The masses in various places also created more than a dozen types of windmills, such as agricultural-commune style, wooden hanging sail style, and carousel style, all of which were very ingenious and applicable.
    After vigorously developing windmills, the Baicheng area has achieved good results. In 1958, the area irrigated by windmills reached 58,900 mu, saving a large amount of labor and animal power, and the crops achieved a bumper harvest. The Chunyang Management District of the Daxing Commune in Baicheng City used windmills to drive rice threshers to thresh rice, threshing 500 jin per hour, which is more than six times more efficient than manual operation.

### 变风害为风利  白城人民广泛利用风动力为农业服务

    变风害为风利
    白城人民广泛利用风动力为农业服务
    本报讯　“风从白城过，都得给干活”。这是向风害作斗争的白城地区人民所发出的豪语。现在这个地区已经拥有用于提水、带动机械和发电等的各种风车达一千八百余台，平均每个公社有十九台风车，个个管理区都利用风动力为农业生产和农村生活服务。
    过去，白城地区常年遭受风沙灾害。每年由西南、西北方向刮来的大风，往往使各县发生被风毁种、缺苗断条、庄稼倒伏等现象；风还吹动沙丘，压盖良田。几年来，这个地区的人民在党的领导下，向风沙干旱展开了顽强的斗争，大规模植树造林，防风固沙，同时大兴水利，制服干旱，收到了显著成效，使风沙干旱的威胁大为减轻。
    在这个基础上，中共白城地委就领导群众进一步利用风动力改造大自然，在大跃进的1958年提出了“变风害为风利”的口号，发动群众广泛制造和使用风车。地委为了适应当前农村经济情况，采取了“小型为主，社办为主，生产为主”和“土法上马，土洋结合，因地制宜，就地取材，因陋就简”的方针，并且确定了“先普及后提高，在普及的基础上提高，在提高的指导下普及”的原则，使风车迅速发展起来。最初，各地推广的风车大部分是只有二马力的55型小风车，渐渐由小及大，种类增多，到现在已拥有自行设计制造的塔高十五米、风轮直径二十二米的3—22型巨型发电风车；这种风车可以在室内操纵，用电动调整方向和速度，有一百二十三马力。风车的使用也由单一的提水灌溉，发展到用于推碾、拉磨、铡草、脱谷、筛粮米、发电等多方面的综合利用。
    在试制风车时，各地党委采取了“思想不通就辩，不懂就参观，不会就学，学会就干”的方法，彻底批判了保守思想，很快就从群众中涌现出大量能工巧匠。比如，我国现在最大型的3—22型发电风车，就是由只有一百二十多个工人的洮安县机械铁工厂试制成功的。这台风车远远超过了这个工厂机床加工负荷力量。但是工人们发挥了敢想敢干的精神，大胆地把机床倒立抬高进行加工，终于获得成功。乾安县让字公社双合管理区原来连尺码都不会量的顾万海主任，在几个木工协助下，创造了利用风车带动石磨、推碾、筛粮、切菜、剥苞米、打场等六种办法，都获得成功。各地群众还创造了农社式、木制挂帆式、走马灯式等十几种风车，都十分巧妙适用。
    白城地区大力发展风车后，已收到良好效果。在1958年全区用风车灌溉面积达五万八千九百亩，节省了大批劳力和畜力，庄稼获得丰收。白城市大兴公社纯阳管理区用风车带动打稻机打稻子，每小时打出五百斤，比人工操作提高效率六倍多。（附图片）
