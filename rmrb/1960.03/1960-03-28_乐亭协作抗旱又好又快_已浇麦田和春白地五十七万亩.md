Loting County, Hebei Province, is carrying out large-scale support and collaboration in the current drought resistance struggle, and the county's drought resistance struggle is progressing well and quickly.

The county has 700,000 mu of land experiencing varying degrees of drought. Most of the drought-stricken areas are in the four communes of Yangezhuang, etc., where water sources are scarce. The other six communes have lighter drought conditions, and water sources and water lifting equipment are relatively abundant. In response to this situation, the Loting County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party called on all communes to promote the communist spirit and carry out large-scale collaboration. The six communes with lighter drought conditions transferred a total of 30,000 strong laborers, bringing 35 power units and complete sets of pumping equipment to help the four communes with severe drought. Their approach is: first, eliminate the wheat fields that have lost moisture; second, eliminate the dry land prepared for planting early-maturing crops; and third, eliminate the spring fallow land that has lost moisture. In order to irrigate the driest land, the Chengguan People's Commune voluntarily gave the water from its canal to the Dazhao Commune, which was severely affected by the drought.

The county has already irrigated more than 570,000 mu of wheat fields and spring fallow land. More than 300,000 mu of land has been leveled and prepared for spring irrigation.

In order to prepare for long-term drought resistance, the support army is also helping the she with a lack of water sources to build water conservancy projects and develop water sources in many ways. With the strong support of fraternal she, the Yangezhuang Commune has built a small reservoir that can store 380,000 cubic meters of water. The Tingliu River Commune dispatched 5,000 laborers, who worked hard for a day to dig through two branch canals for water diversion, providing new water sources for the downstream fraternal she and teams.

    乐亭协作抗旱又好又快
    已浇麦田和春白地五十七万亩
    河北乐亭县在当前的抗旱斗争中，展开大支援、大协作，全县抗旱斗争进行得又好又快。
    这个县有七十万亩土地出现不同程度的旱情。受旱地区大部分在水源缺乏的阎各庄等四个公社，其他六个公社旱情较轻，而水源和提水工具比较充足。针对这种情况，中共乐亭县委号召各公社发扬共产主义精神，开展大协作。旱情较轻的六个公社，共抽调出三万名壮劳力，带着三十五台动力机和全套抽水设备，到旱情严重的四个公社帮助抗旱。他们的作法是：第一步消灭失墒的麦田，第二步消灭准备播种早熟作物的旱地，第三步消灭失墒的春白地。为了灌溉最干旱的土地，城关人民公社把自己渠道的水，主动让给旱情严重的大钊公社。
    全县已浇麦田和春白地五十七万多亩。还有三十多万亩土地进行了平整，做好了春灌的准备。
    为了做好长期抗旱的准备，支援大军还帮助缺乏水源的社兴修水利工程，从多方面开发水源。阎各庄公社在兄弟社的大力支援下，已修好能蓄三十八万立方水的一座小水库。汀流河公社抽出五千名劳力，大干一天就挖通了两条引水支渠，给下游的兄弟社、队提供了新的水源。
