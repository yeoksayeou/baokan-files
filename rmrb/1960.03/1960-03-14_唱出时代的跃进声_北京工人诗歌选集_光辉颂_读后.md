Singing the Praises of the Era's Leap Forward
-- After Reading the Beijing Workers' Poetry Collection "Ode to Glory"
    Li Yuenan
    The recently published "Ode to Glory" by Beijing Publishing House includes works by seventeen worker-poets from Beijing. These works made me feel as if I was watching a socialist steed galloping, and as if I was hearing the booming drums of the Great Leap Forward. The workers' singers' production practice and revolutionary struggle are inexhaustible art sources, which give their long and short poems a strong sense of life, combat, and a strong sense of the times. When they carry out amateur creation, they can also master the clarity and imagery of language, just like they are good at mastering production tools, to serve socialist construction and sing the strongest paean to the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Commune!
    With overflowing passion, the authors of this collection of poems praise the thousands upon thousands of shock troops, nursery workers, job seekers, service personnel... as well as the vanguards and red banner bearers on various production fronts such as steel mills, power plants, coal mines, rolling mills, machinery factories, textile factories, synthetic fiber factories, printing factories... Their selfless labor enthusiasm, their communist style and collectivist spirit, and their ambition to climb the peaks of science and technology and create miracles, all inspire people's hearts and encourage the people to move forward!
    When we read Comrade Li Xue'ao's "Handshake with Xu Xuehui," who wouldn't have the flames in their hearts ignited by these passionately unrestrained lines of poetry? It is our great and glorious Party, our mother-like motherland, that has cultivated and nurtured Xu Xuehui and Xu Xuehui-style heroic sons and daughters. Their achievements are so glorious, and their images are so moving:
          Your hand,
          As firm as steel,
          As big as a dipper,
          A rifle butt can't break it,
          A bayonet can't pierce it! …
          …
          Ah, good daughter of the Party,
          You have a thousand hands!
          You have ten thousand hands!
          Every pair harder than steel,
          Every pair as big as a dipper.
    The author has expanded a worker's glorious image into the glorious image of an entire era and an entire class. The author starts from reality and also expresses a revolutionary romantic imagination that is higher than reality. Therefore, it further highlights the theme and the clear and strong combativeness of the poem!
    In the lyrical short poems that occupy a large part of the collection, Comrade Fan Yiben's "Ringtone Everywhere" uses lines such as "You ask how many factories there are in the eastern suburbs? Please count the stars in the sky" to concisely depict the great changes in the industrial construction of the great capital in the past ten years since the founding of the country. Comrade Han Yiping's "Ode to Glory" factory poems use a brisk melody and a loud voice to sing the capital's workers' lively fighting spirit! And his "Commune's October Full of Spring Breeze" uses profound lyrical language to praise Chairman Mao and to paint a picture of the fiery labor scene and the happy scene that is better than heaven for the People's Commune. Miners Wang Yudong and Li Bin sang another magnificent movement – the battle song of seizing coal, the spirit is magnificent, and the tone is loud. When we read lines such as "The heart of the earth is beating! The pithead is smiling! The winch sings loudly, and the motor sound pulls the coal bucket to fly," our hearts seem to fly to the pithead where the red flag is waving.
    Printing worker Zhang Fuzeng described the enthusiastic labor competition in the workshop where you chase me in poems such as "Let's Watch Tomorrow's War," and outlined the voices and smiles of heroic figures. Comrade Wen Chengxun's narrative poem is a unique flower in this collection.
    This collection of poems, to a certain extent, reflects the depth and breadth of the capital's workers' life and struggle, and writes the leap forward sound of our great era. Of course, in terms of the scope of compilation, it would be better if it could be more extensive, making the content richer and the style more diverse. We hope to read more collections of worker poems.

### 唱出时代的跃进声——北京工人诗歌选集“光辉颂”读后

    唱出时代的跃进声
    ——北京工人诗歌选集“光辉颂”读后
    李岳南
    北京出版社最近出版的《光辉颂》，包括北京十七位工人诗歌作者的作品。这些作品使我仿佛看到了社会主义的骏马在飞奔，仿佛听到了大跃进的金鼓在齐鸣。工人歌手的生产实践和革命斗争是取之不尽、用之不竭的艺术源泉，这就赋予他们的长歌短颂以浓厚的生活战斗气息和强烈的时代感。他们在进行业余创作的时候，又能够掌握语言的鲜明性和形象性，就像善于掌握生产工具一样地为社会主义建设服务，为总路线、大跃进、人民公社唱出了最强音的凯歌！
    这本诗集的作者们，以洋溢的激情，讴歌了成千成百的突击队员、保育员、找活员、服务员……以及炼钢厂、发电厂、煤矿、轧钢厂、机械厂、纺织厂、合成纤维厂、印刷厂……各个生产战线上的尖兵和红旗手，他们的忘我的劳动热情，他们的共产主义风格和集体主义的精神，他们的攀登科学技术高峰、创造奇迹的雄心大志，在在激励着人们的心魄，鼓舞着人民前进！
    当我们读到李学鳌同志的《和徐学惠握手》的时候，谁不为这激情奔放的诗句，点燃起心上的火焰？是我们伟大光荣的党，我们母亲般的祖国，才培养哺育出了徐学惠和徐学惠式的英雄儿女们，她
  （他）们的业绩是这样光辉；她（他）们的形象，又是如此动人：
          你的手，
          坚如钢，
          大如斗，
          枪托砸不破，
          刺刀戳不透！……
          ……
          啊，党的好女儿，
          你有千双手！
          你有万双手！
          双双比钢硬，
          双双大如斗。
    作者将一个工人的光辉形象，扩展为整个时代，整个阶级的光辉形象了；作者既从现实出发，又抒发了比现实更高的革命浪漫主义的想像。因此，更加突出了诗的主题思想和鲜明强烈的战斗性！
    在诗集里占着大量篇幅的抒情短诗里，范以本同志的《铃声处处响》用“你问东郊有多少工厂？请你数一数天上的星星”等诗句，概括地描绘了建国十年来伟大首都工业建设的伟大变化。韩忆萍同志的《光辉颂》的工厂组诗，是以轻快的旋律、嘹亮的歌喉，唱出了首都工人们那种生龙活虎的战斗姿态！而他的《公社十月满春风》，更是用深湛的抒情语言，歌颂了毛主席，并且为人民公社描绘出一幅幅火红的劳动场面和那胜过天堂的幸福情景。矿工王玉东和李斌同志，唱出了另一支雄伟的乐章——夺煤的战歌，气概是磅礴的，音调是宏亮的。当我们读到“地心在跳！井口在笑！绞车高声歌唱，电机声拉着煤斗飞跑。”这样的诗句时，我们的心好像也飞到红旗招展的井口去了。
    印刷工人张福增同志，在《且看明天大战》等诗篇里，描绘出车间的你追我赶的劳动竞赛的热潮，勾勒出英雄人物们的声音笑貌。温承训同志的叙事诗，在这个集子里，是别树一枝的花朵。
    这本诗集，在一定程度上，反映了首都工人生活斗争的深度和广度，写出了我们这伟大时代的跃进声。当然，从编选的范围来说，如果能更广泛些，使内容更加丰富，风格更加多样，就会更好些。我们希望读到更多的工人诗歌选集。
