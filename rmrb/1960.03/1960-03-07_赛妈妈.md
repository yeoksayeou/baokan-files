　　Better Than a Mother
　　In the vast cities and rural areas of our country, there are a large number of working women who, in the past, had two or three children, always dragging one along and carrying another. They had to cook and wash clothes, and were busy all day long, unable to participate in production. Now, they can all go to their production posts with peace of mind. This is because their children are in kindergartens and have found a loving mother – the childcare workers.
　　In the old society, people regarded their children as their private property. “Raising children to guard against old age,” raising and loving children was to solve their own living problems in old age. In our socialist society today, people no longer have to worry about living problems. People's thinking is also changing with the changes in the economic base. Children are the flowers of the motherland, the successors to the socialist and communist cause, and are no longer the private property of anyone. People care for and cherish these flowers with the feeling of "treating other people's children as their own."
　　Our childcare workers are precisely people with this new spirit. In order to allow mothers to produce with peace of mind and contribute more to the socialist cause; in order to make children grow up well and cultivate new people for communist society, they love their work very much, regard the nurseries as their own homes, and treat other people's children as their own. Everything is considered from the perspective of making it convenient for mothers and beneficial to children. When the children are cold, they personally sew cotton clothes; when the children are sick, they personally serve medicine. If the children's parents have something to do and cannot pick them up, they will pick them up and drop them off on behalf of their parents, sharing the parents' worries. Some childcare workers have also proposed: Childcare workers should be more loving than mothers. Everything that mothers can do must be done, and what mothers cannot do must also be strived to do. What a great wish, what a noble virtue. Isn't this better than a mother, more loving than a mother? Today, the deeds of the childcare workers of the Dafosi Street Kindergarten in Beijing, as introduced in this newspaper, are just one example of the thousands of "better than a mother."
　　With such a group of loving mothers, which mother would not be willing to entrust her children to their care? Which mother would not be able to produce with peace of mind and make greater contributions to the motherland?

    赛妈妈
    在我国广大城市、农村，有很大一批劳动妇女，过去因为有了两三个孩子，整天身边拖一个，身上抱一个，又要烧饭，又要洗衣服，成天忙忙乱乱，不能参加生产。现在她们都安心地走上了生产岗位。这就是因为她们的孩子进了保育院，又找到了亲爱的妈妈——保育工作者。
    在旧社会，人们把子女看成是自己的私有物。“养儿防老”，养孩子、爱孩子是为了解决自己老年时候的生活问题。在我们今天社会主义社会里，人们不用担心什么生活问题了。人的思想也正随着经济基础的变化而变化。孩子是祖国的花朵，是社会主义和共产主义事业的接班人，不再是哪一个人的私有物了。人们都以“视人子如己子”的心情去关怀和爱护这些花朵。
    我们的保育工作者们正是具有这种新精神面貌的人。为了让妈妈们安心生产，为社会主义事业更多出些力；为了使孩子成长得好，为共产主义社会培养新人，她们非常热爱自己的工作，把托儿组织看做是自己的家，把别人的孩子看做是自己的孩子。一切从方便妈妈们、有利于孩子们着想。孩子冷了，她们亲自缝补棉衣；孩子病了，她们亲侍汤药。孩子的父母有事不能接送，她们就代父母们接送，为父母分忧。有的保育工作者还提出：保育员要比妈妈更亲。凡是妈妈能做到的都要做到，妈妈做不到的也要争取做到。这是多么伟大的心愿，多么崇高的美德。这岂不是赛过妈妈，比妈妈更亲。今天本报介绍的北京大佛寺街道幼儿园保育工作者的事迹，只是千万个“赛过妈妈”的一个例子。
    有了这样一批慈母，又有哪个妈妈会不愿把孩子托给她们照顾呢？又有哪个妈妈会不安心生产、为祖国做出更大贡献呢？
