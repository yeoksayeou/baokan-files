Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 3rd: Former Japanese Prime Minister and one of the leaders of the non-mainstream faction of the Liberal Democratic Party, Tanzan Ishibashi, told Ikuo Yasui, director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, today that he will do his utmost to break the deadlock in Japan-China relations.

    Ikuo Yasui announced the content of his meeting with Ishibashi at a press conference today. Ikuo Yasui spoke to Ishibashi about his recent visit to China. He pointed out to Ishibashi that the Nobusuke Kishi government is currently stepping up its efforts to get the Diet to approve the new Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and that the Nobusuke Kishi government also wants to break the deadlock in Japan-China relations from the standpoint of separating politics and economics, which is absolutely impossible. Ishibashi also pointed out that it is necessary to guard against the conspiracy of "those who separate politics and economics."

    Currently, the dissatisfaction of the non-mainstream faction within the Liberal Democratic Party with the Kishi Nobusuke group's approach to concluding the Japan-U.S. military alliance and its China policy is becoming increasingly apparent.

    The "Asahi Shimbun" published an article on the 2nd entitled "Groups Trying to Break the (Deadlock in) Japan-China Relations Begin to Move," saying that two organizations, the "China Problem Research Society" and the "Research Society for Improving Japan-China Diplomatic Relations," have been established one after another within the Liberal Democratic Party, and the dynamics surrounding Japan-China relations within the party are quite eye-catching. The newspaper said, "Especially recently, the debate within the party surrounding the Japan-China issue is moving beyond the principle of 'separation of politics and economics' that Prime Minister Kishi and others have always insisted on, and moving towards 'politics and economics are inseparable.'" The newspaper predicts that "this trend will be subtly linked to the current 'deliberation of the Security Treaty' and will have a significant impact on future Diet deliberation work."

    石桥不满岸政府对华政策
    表示要努力打开日中关系僵局
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本前首相、自由民主党非当权派领袖之一石桥湛山今天向日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会理事长安井郁表示，他将竭尽全力为打开日中关系僵局而努力。
    安井郁今天在记者招待会上宣布了他同石桥会谈的内容。安井郁向石桥谈到不久前他访问中国的情况。他向石桥指出，目前岸信介政府正在加紧行动要使国会批准新日美“安全条约”，岸信介政府还想站在把政治和经济分开的立场来打开日中关系僵局，这是绝对行不通的。石桥也指出，要提防“政治、经济分开论者”的阴谋。
    目前自由民主党内非当权派对岸信介集团缔结日美军事同盟的作法和对华政策的不满正日益表面化。
    “朝日新闻”2日以“开始动起来的打开日中（关系僵局）集团”为标题，发表文章说，在自由民主党内相继成立了“中国问题研究会”和“改善日中邦交研究会”两个组织，党内围绕日中关系出现的动态相当惹人注意。报纸说，“特别是最近，党内围绕日中问题出现的争论，正在越出岸首相等人一直坚持的‘政治和经济分开’的原则，向着‘政治和经济不可分’前进了一步。”这家报纸预料，“这种趋势将会同当前‘安全条约的审议’微妙地牵连起来，对今后的国会审议工作产生相当大的影响。”
