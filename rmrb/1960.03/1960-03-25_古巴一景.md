    A Glimpse of Cuba
    Walking into the Cuban forests, one often discovers trees adorned with various bright and beautiful colors, including the bright colors of lilac, the warm tones of violet, and the fresh yellow and light green of orchids. Upon closer inspection, one can see that these colors are created by a large number of tree snails.
    The color of this snail varies with the chemical composition of the bark of the tree it inhabits. According to recent discoveries, the same species of snail can range in color from pale yellow to bright orange-red, each different.
    No bird or other animal wants to try and taste this snail. It turns out that these snails are similar to the bark of the quinine trees they inhabit, and they all taste bitter.

    古巴一景
    走进古巴的树林，常常发现树木上点缀着各种鲜艳美丽的色彩，有丁香花的明亮的颜色，有紫罗兰的温馨的色调，有兰花的鲜黄和淡绿。仔细一瞧，就能看出这些色彩都是大量的木蜗牛造成的。
    这种蜗牛的颜色随着它所栖息的树木的树皮化学成分而变异。根据最近的发现，同一种蜗牛，而它的颜色可以从浅黄色到明亮橘红色，各个不同。
    没有一只鸟和其他动物想试一下，尝尝这种蜗牛的味道。原来这些蜗牛和它们栖息的奎宁树的树皮差不多，味道都是苦的。
