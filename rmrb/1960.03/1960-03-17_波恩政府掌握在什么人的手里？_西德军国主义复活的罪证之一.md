Who is the Bonn Government in the Hands Of?
    ——One of the Proofs of the Revival of West German Militarism
    West German militarism is rapidly reviving. Just look at the list of West German military and political personnel today, and you can prove this. Hitler's accomplices have now become Adenauer's favorites and are occupying important positions in the Bonn government. Those Nazi generals who once left countless blood debts in the Soviet Union and throughout Europe are now drawing up military plans for aggression and expansion. Those Nazi judges who once sentenced countless anti-fascist fighters to death are now persecuting West German peace fighters and progressive forces.
    Six current ministers in the West German government held the same positions during Hitler's time. And all of the more than one hundred army, navy, and air force generals currently commanding the West German army once held important positions in Hitler's army.
    Among these fascist elements who have usurped important positions, the following people are particularly heinous.
    The Murderous Devil Oberländer
    This current West German Minister for Refugees was the culprit in the massacre of 3,000 Jews by Hitler's "Nightingale" battalion in Lviv, Soviet Union, in July 1941. Today, just like twenty years ago, he is preaching a crusade against "alien races" in his speeches and writings. By "alien races," he means the Jewish and Slavic people.
    Stormtrooper Schröder
    As early as 1947, this former Hitler stormtrooper published his political line for West Germany. He wrote: "German philosophy is based on blood, soil, and war." Today, as West German Minister of the Interior, he is acting according to this Nazi dogma. He persecutes anti-fascists, puts them in prison, persecutes their organizations, and protects all revanchist and neo-fascist forces and organizations.
    Race Hatred Theorist Globke
    He used to defend the fascists' extermination of the Jews in his commentary on the Nuremberg racial laws. Today, he is Adenauer's private secretary, becoming the most influential confidant of the West German Chancellor and one of the most powerful figures in the Bonn state. His fascist ideas remain the same.
    Nazi General Speidel
    He is one of the most famous Nazi generals who are now regaining control of the Bonn Bundeswehr and preparing for atomic war. This murderer, who assassinated the King of Yugoslavia before World War II, once placed thousands of French patriots under the knives of Hitler's SS government. Today, he is stationed at the NATO headquarters as Bonn's representative and, thanks to American appreciation, serves as the Central European Commander of this aggressive group's army.
    Can the peace-loving people of the world still tolerate these Nazi war criminals who are stained with the blood of the European people, and the militarist and aggressive expansion policy of the Bonn government controlled by these murderers? No, people cannot remain silent. The German people and the European people will never allow these fascist criminals, who take war as life and massacre as a hobby, to dominate their destiny again. They will never allow history to repeat itself. The struggle against the revival of West German militarism is unfolding throughout Germany and throughout Europe. Those who follow Hitler's path will surely meet Hitler's fate.

    波恩政府掌握在什么人的手里？
    ——西德军国主义复活的罪证之一
    西德军国主义正在迅速复活中。只要看一看今天西德军政人员的名单，就可以证明这一点了。希特勒的帮凶，现在又成了阿登纳的红人，窃踞了波恩政府的要职。那些曾经在苏联和整个欧洲留下过累累血债的纳粹将军们，今天又在拟订着侵略扩张的军事计划。那些过去曾经判处过无数反法西斯战士极刑的纳粹法官们，今天又在对西德的和平战士与进步力量进行迫害。
    西德政府中六个现任部长在希特勒时代担任过同样的职务。而目前指挥着西德军队的全部一百多名陆海空军将领，都曾在希特勒军队中担任过重要职务。
    在这些窃踞要职的法西斯分子中，下面几个人是特别罪大恶极的。
    杀人魔王奥勃兰德尔
    这个现任西德难民部长，是1941年7月希特勒“夜莺”营在苏联利沃夫杀害三千犹太人事件的罪魁。今天他同二十年前一模一样，在言论和著作中宣扬对“异族”进行十字军征伐。他所谓的“异族”，就是指的犹太族和斯拉夫族人民。
    冲锋队队员施罗德
    早在1947年，这个从前的希特勒冲锋队队员就发表了他给西德提出的政治路线。他写道：“德意志的哲学是建立在血、土和战争的基础上的。”今天，他作为西德内政部长，又按照这种纳粹教条行动。他迫害反法西斯主义者，把他们关进监狱，迫害他们的组织，并庇护一切复仇主义和新法西斯主义势力和组织。
  种族仇恨理论家格鲁布克
    从前他在对纽伦堡种族法的评论中为法西斯分子消灭犹太人进行辩护。今天他是阿登纳的私人秘书，成为西德总理最有影响的亲信和波恩国家中最有势力的人物之一。他的法西斯思想依然如故。
    纳粹将军斯派达尔
    他是那些今天重新控制波恩国防军并准备原子战争的最有名的纳粹将领之一。这个二次大战前暗杀过南斯拉夫国王的凶手，曾把成千上万的法国爱国者置于希特勒党卫军政府的屠刀之下。今天他作为波恩的代表驻在北大西洋公约组织总部，并且由于得到美国的赏识而担任了这个侵略集团军的中欧司令。
    对于这些双手沾满欧洲人民鲜血的纳粹战犯，对于被这些杀人犯所掌握的波恩政府的军国主义侵略扩张政策，世界各国爱好和平的人民难道还能够容忍吗？不，人们是不能沉默的。德国人民和欧洲人民决不容许这些以战争为生命以屠杀为嗜好的法西斯罪犯再来支配他们的命运。他们决不容许历史重演。反对西德军国主义复活的斗争正在整个德国和整个欧洲展开。走希特勒道路的人一定会得到希特勒的下场。
