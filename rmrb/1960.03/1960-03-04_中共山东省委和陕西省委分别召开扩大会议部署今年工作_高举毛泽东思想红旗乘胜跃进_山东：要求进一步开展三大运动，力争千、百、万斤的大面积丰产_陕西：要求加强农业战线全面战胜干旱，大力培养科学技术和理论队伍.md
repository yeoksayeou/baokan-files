The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Convene Enlarged Meetings to Deploy This Year's Work
Holding High the Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought to Advance Victoriously
Shandong: Requires Further Development of the Three Great Movements, Striving for Large-Scale High Yields of 1,000, 100, and 10,000 Jin per Mu
Shaanxi: Requires Strengthening the Agricultural Front to Comprehensively Overcome Drought, Vigorously Cultivating Scientific, Technical, and Theoretical Teams

(Our dispatch) The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened its Second Fifteenth (Enlarged) Meeting from February 3rd to 15th. Comrade Shu Tong, First Secretary of the Provincial Committee, delivered a report at the beginning of the meeting and a summary at the end. The meeting focused on discussing and adopting the Shandong Province's 1960 National Economic Plan (Proposal), and also studied some of Chairman Mao's works, and researched relevant theoretical issues regarding the situation and the economy. The meeting issued a battle call to Party organizations at all levels in Shandong, all Party member cadres, and the people of the province: taking Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, continuously promote a new upsurge in the production, learning, and technical revolution movements, and strive to better and more comprehensively overfulfill the 1960 national economic plan.

The meeting believes that the current situation is infinitely good. The province's political and economic situation, like the overall national situation, presents a scene of continuous leap forward and vigorous vitality. In 1959, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of the province bravely advanced along the bright road guided by the general line of socialist construction, displaying soaring revolutionary zeal, and enabling all construction undertakings in the province to achieve another continuous leap forward on the basis of the 1958 Great Leap Forward. In 1959, the province's total industrial and agricultural output value increased by 23.7% compared to 1958. Among them, the total industrial output value increased by 28.71%. The output of major industrial products, steel, iron, coal, and electricity, increased by 50% to more than three times, and the output of other major products generally increased by more than 20%. The total output value of agricultural and sideline production increased by 17.99%. Although agricultural production suffered a drought unprecedented in decades, it still achieved a continuous leap forward on the basis of the 1958 Great Leap Forward, with total grain output increasing by 10.5% compared to 1958, and cotton increasing by 9.1% compared to 1958. With the growth of industrial and agricultural production and the continuous improvement of people's lives, transportation, commerce, cultural and educational undertakings, and financial revenue have also achieved tremendous achievements. Since the beginning of 1960, industrial production has broken the abnormal phenomenon of "low at the beginning of the month and high at the end of the month" in previous years, and achieved a "red start," "daily red," and "all-month red." On the basis of large-scale farmland water conservancy construction in winter, agricultural production is ushering in a new upsurge in spring production.

The meeting believes that in order to successfully complete Shandong Province's 1960 plan for continued leap forward in the national economy, it is necessary to further vigorously carry out the three great movements of production, learning, and technical revolution and technical innovation:

In terms of the production movement, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the policy of taking agriculture as the foundation and simultaneously developing industry and agriculture under the condition of giving priority to the development of heavy industry. In order to realize the leap forward plan for agricultural production, it is necessary to continue to implement the policy of taking grain as the key link and comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries, and vigorously launch the "movement for large-scale high yields of 1,000 (jin of grain per mu), 100 (jin to 200 jin of ginned cotton per mu, 500 jin to 600 jin of peanuts per mu), and 10,000 (jin of sweet potatoes per mu)" and the "movement of one or two mu of high-yield water conservancy farmland per person, and one pig per person or one pig per mu." In order to promote the comprehensive and rapid development of agricultural production, the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture" should continue to be implemented, and agricultural technical revolution and technical innovation should be vigorously promoted. The primary key to realizing this year's agricultural leap forward plan lies in grasping spring production. Strengthen the management of wheat fields, ensure timely sowing of spring fields, and fight the first battle for the continued leap forward of agriculture in 1960. On the basis of striving for comprehensive and rapid development of agriculture, it is necessary to accelerate the development of light industry, improve product quality, increase varieties and designs, in order to supply the people with more necessities of life, and accumulate funds for the accelerated development of heavy industry. In order to support the technical transformation of agriculture and the priority development of heavy industry, the industrial front must continue to implement the policy of taking steel as the key link and comprehensively leaping forward, further expand the foundation of heavy industry, strengthen weak departments, and more vigorously support the construction of agriculture, transportation, and light industry. At the same time, efforts should also be made to promote transportation work, financial and trade work, and cultural and educational work, so that these aspects of work can keep up with the needs of industrial and agricultural production development.

In terms of the technical revolution and technical innovation movement, the meeting pointed out: Technical revolution and technical innovation are a great historical task of the Party in socialist construction. Socialist labor emulation, with technical revolution and technical innovation as its main content, has been widely carried out in all departments of the province's national economy. This is a great situation for Party organizations at all levels to further lead the technical revolution and technical innovation movement. In the current technical revolution and technical innovation movement, the following tasks should be focused on: (1) Conscientiously summarize and improve the experience of carrying out the technical revolution and technical innovation movement, study and grasp the laws of the movement, and summarize the innovations and creations of the masses, bit by bit, from a workshop or a section, and quickly promote them. (2) Vigorously promote mechanization and semi-mechanization. (3) Sufficient attention should be paid to the technical revolution and technical innovation movement in agriculture. The technical revolution in agriculture, centered on deep plowing, drainage and irrigation, harvesting, processing, and transportation, implements tool reforms, gradually realizes semi-mechanization and mechanization, and at the same time vigorously strengthens the reform of agricultural cultivation techniques. (4) Conscientiously do a good job in resource investigation. Vigorously develop the comprehensive utilization of marine products, sea salt, coal, aquatic products, lake products, etc. (5) Strive to develop cutting-edge science and drive cutting-edge industrial technology. (6) Cultivate a scientific and technical team and a theoretical team that are both red and expert, establish and improve a base network, better organize forces, and carry out work faster.

In terms of the learning movement, the meeting pointed out: The current practice of revolution and construction has put forward a solemn and urgent task for us, which is to conscientiously study Mao Zedong Thought, in order to improve the theoretical level of Marxism-Leninism, and gradually learn to use the weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to solve practical and theoretical problems in revolution and construction. Actively promote Mao Zedong Thought and launch a great ideological revolution among the broad masses of the people. This is not only a prerequisite for doing a good job in all current work, but also a fundamental guarantee for achieving continuous leap forward in the 1960s. Party organizations, Party members, and cadres at all levels must further carry forward the working style of the mass line, go deep into reality, go deep among the masses, go deep into the production process, and promptly discover and solve problems. And use the working method of grasping both ends to bring along the middle, on the one hand, always grasp the direction of progress, on the other hand, pay attention to and help the backward, earnestly solve the problems of backward units, and promptly break through weak links, in order to promote the entire work and movement to continuously move forward.

(Our dispatch) Making every effort to strengthen the agricultural front, especially unfolding the all-Party and all-people struggle against drought at present, seizing the first season's bumper harvest this year and preparing for spring sowing, is the central topic of the Thirteenth Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Second Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

This meeting started on the 5th and ended on the 22nd. The meeting focused on resolving the issue of understanding and policy tasks for strengthening the agricultural front, and also adopted the method of a mobile on-site meeting, spending seven days visiting five counties (Weinan, Dali, Pucheng, Tongchuan, Sanyuan) to some grassroots units that have done a better job in drought resistance, summer field management, spring sowing preparation, pig raising and fertilizer accumulation, and tool reform, learning, discussing, and travelling along the way, summarizing and promoting many advanced experiences on the agricultural front of the province. This has pushed the province's summer field management and spring sowing preparation work, centered on drought resistance, to a new climax. The meeting also discussed and determined the draft plan proposal for the national economy of the Shaanxi region this year, formulated a preliminary plan for cultivating scientific and technical teams and theoretical teams, and decided to launch a movement of 100,000 red banner units and one million red banner pacesetters in the province, etc. The meeting called for thoroughly developing the movement to study Mao Zedong Thought throughout the province, and pushing the movement to study Mao Zedong Thought to a new climax.

From the situation reported by various places and seen at the on-site meeting, the comrades present unanimously believed that the situation in the province is extremely good at the beginning of this year, and it is a larger and more comprehensive leap forward situation after last year's Great Leap Forward. An unprecedented "red start" has appeared on the industrial front. After last year's great drought, the people's communes throughout the province still achieved a great harvest, and after the winter rectification, they have taken even greater leap forward steps. The people's communes' larger-scale cooperation marks that the people's communes' large collective and large-scale production have embarked on a more magnificent new stage, finally eliminating the remnants of individual economy, etc., in rural production layout and other aspects in the past, and all rural production tasks have been completed earlier, faster, and better than last year. After getting through the sowing and overwintering stages well, summer field management began the battle of the regreening stage a month earlier than last year, and the growth of wheat seedlings is better than any other year. The preparation for spring sowing of cotton fields and autumn fields has also surpassed any previous year. This year, due to the unfolding of the pig raising and fertilizer accumulation movement, by the 22nd, the original plan had been overfulfilled by 52.54%. A drought resistance movement on a larger scale than last autumn is unfolding throughout the province.

The meeting believes that making every effort to strengthen the agricultural front is a central link in developing the socialist economy at a high speed and in a proportionate manner, and realizing the province's continued leap forward this year. Agriculture is the foundation of national economic development, and developing industry and agriculture simultaneously under the condition of giving priority to the development of heavy industry is the Party's consistent policy. Resolutely implementing this correct policy, Shaanxi overcame the great drought of about 100 days last year and achieved a great agricultural harvest. The total output value of agriculture and sideline production increased by more than 12% compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. The great leap forward in agriculture promoted the leap forward in industry and other undertakings. The province's total industrial output value increased by 48% compared to 1958 last year, and the purchase of commodities also increased by more than 66%, and the supply of commodities increased by more than 40.8%. Therefore, the meeting believes that it is necessary to strengthen the agricultural front in every possible way, put agriculture in the first place, and develop agriculture faster, in order to meet the needs of the high-speed development of the entire national economy. To this end, the meeting proposed to further implement the principle of taking grain as the key link and developing all five industries in a comprehensive leap forward; vigorously grasp water, fertilizer, and field management, and transform one-third of the province's low-yield cultivated land into high-yield land; continuously improve agricultural labor productivity with tool reform and semi-mechanization as the center; further consolidate and improve the people's communes, and all aspects of industry, transportation, commerce, political and legal affairs, culture and education should fully support the agricultural front; establish lofty ambitions, improve leadership methods, and other measures.

The meeting fully estimated the current drought threat, and believed that currently making every effort to overcome drought, vowing to seize the first season's great harvest this year, and preparing for spring sowing to lay a good foundation for the autumn's great harvest, is the key of keys in strengthening the agricultural front. Following last autumn's great drought of about 100 days, the province has suffered more than 100 days of drought last winter and this spring, and the drought situation is still developing, the temperature is still rising, and the soil moisture consumption is very large. The drought seriously threatens the growth of summer crops and the sowing of autumn crops. The meeting determined that drought resistance is currently the most important, most urgent, and overriding central task, and requires the entire Party and the entire people to immediately mobilize urgently to overcome drought and seize the first season's great harvest. To this end, it is necessary to give full play to the benefits of all water conservancy facilities and irrigation tools, and try every means to increase irrigation facilities; areas with water conservancy facilities should strive to increase production more, appropriately expand the early autumn sowing area, and make full use of small plots of land to grow more melons and vegetables; industry, agriculture, soldiers, students, and commerce should twist into one rope to support drought resistance, and drive the comprehensive leap forward of other undertakings in supporting drought resistance and seizing a bumper harvest.

After participating in several drought resistance on-site meetings, the comrades present unanimously concluded that as long as we establish the lofty ambition of ensuring a bumper harvest without rain, rely on the enthusiasm and wisdom of the broad masses, there is no land that cannot be irrigated. For example, the Yidu Production Team of the Sucun People's Commune in Dali County vigorously dug machine wells, fully utilized the deep groundwater, realized high-standard water conservancy, and set an example for drought resistance and ensuring a bumper harvest in the plains.

The Liuqu People's Commune implemented the whole area as a single chessboard in the 25,000 mu of high-yield wheat land, and merged the 788 wells into 25 canals, achieving water conservancy in the entire area. These have provided rich experience for drought resistance and irrigation. In particular, the vivid example of the Zhuoli Production Team of the Chengcheng People's Commune in Pucheng County diverting water to the plateau greatly inspired all the comrades present. After these experiences and enthusiasm were promptly spread to all parts of the province by the comrades present, they immediately turned into huge material forces, and the province's drought resistance movement quickly moved towards a higher climax. By the 22nd, the province's drought resistance army had increased sharply from 350,000 when the meeting started on the 5th to 3,160,000, exceeding 56% of the drought resistance climax last autumn. The daily irrigated area has also increased from more than 710,000 mu on the 5th to 1,100,000 mu, exceeding the highest daily irrigated area in the drought resistance last autumn by 54%.

In summarizing the advanced experiences of various advanced units at the on-site meeting and in various parts of the province, the comrades present believed that the most fundamental reasons why the advanced are advanced are two: one is to continuously strengthen the Party's leadership and quickly and resolutely implement the Party's line and policy; the other is to continue to implement the mass line and vigorously carry out mass movements.

The comrades present unanimously believed in the discussion that countless facts since the province's Great Leap Forward have proved that as long as we continuously strengthen the Party's leadership, quickly and resolutely implement the Party's instructions, and implement the Party's line and policy formulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we can build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way. To this end, the meeting called for unfolding a movement to study Mao Zedong Thought throughout the province, attaching importance to investigation and research, summarizing experience, and improving leadership levels.

The comrades present also believed from summarizing the advanced experience of the province's advanced units and the on-site meeting that further implementing the Party's mass line and boldly mobilizing the masses is the central issue in realizing this year's continued leap forward. In order to further boldly mobilize the masses, the meeting proposed: it is necessary to resolutely implement the cadre's sending down to labor and tempering, the cadre's planting of experimental fields, implementing two participations, one reform, and three combinations, and promoting the effective method of sending down county, commune, and management district cadres to production teams to take turns serving as deputy positions; most of the cadres sent down should be sent to backward teams and poor teams to help change the face of backward teams and poor teams; the activists of poor and lower-middle peasant origin who have emerged in the Great Leap Forward, who have good ties with the masses, are full of energy, dare to overcome difficulties, and are loyal to socialism, should be appointed to leading positions at the grassroots level; vigorously support new things, and vigorously promote various advanced experiences created by the masses; adhere to the principle of being both red and expert, promote the experience of "one main, two auxiliary, and three combinations" (production, education, and scientific research, three different units, each focusing on its own industry, and the other two as auxiliary), do a good job in the work of its own department, and cultivate a large number of scientific and technical talents.

The meeting believes that the enthusiasm and creativity of the people are the fundamental forces for building socialism at high speed. In order to insert red flags, erect benchmarks, vigorously carry out mass movements, and widely launch the socialist emulation movement centered on technical innovation and cultural revolution, the meeting decided to launch a movement of 100,000 red banner units and one million red banner pacesetters throughout the province.

    中共山东省委和陕西省委分别召开扩大会议部署今年工作
    高举毛泽东思想红旗乘胜跃进
    山东：要求进一步开展三大运动，力争千、百、万斤的大面积丰产
    陕西：要求加强农业战线全面战胜干旱，大力培养科学技术和理论队伍
    本报讯　中共山东省委于2月3日到15日召开了第二届第十五次（扩大）会议。省委第一书记舒同同志在会议开始时作了报告，并在会议结束时作了总结。会上着重讨论和通过了山东省1960年国民经济计划（建议），并且学习了毛主席的部分著作，研究了有关形势和经济的若干理论问题。会议向山东各级党组织、全体党员干部和全省人民，发出了战斗的号召：以毛泽东思想为纲，不断地促进生产、学习、技术革命运动的新高涨，为更好更全面地超额完成1960年的国民经济计划而奋斗。
    会议认为，目前的形势无限好。全省的政治、经济形势和全国总的形势一样，呈现着一片持续跃进、生气勃勃的景象。1959年全省人民在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，沿着社会主义建设总路线所指引的光明道路奋勇前进，发挥了冲天的革命干劲，使全省各项建设事业在1958年大跃进的基础上，又实现了继续大跃进。1959年全省工农业总产值比1958年增长23．7％。其中，工业总产值增长28．71％。主要工业产品产量，钢、铁、煤、电分别增长50％到三倍以上，其它主要产品，一般都增长20％以上。农副业总产值增长17．99％。农业生产虽然遭受几十年来未有过的旱灾，仍然在1958年大跃进的基础上，实现了连续跃进，粮食总产量比1958年增长10．5％；棉花比1958年增长9．1％。随着工农业生产的增长和人民生活的不断提高，交通运输、商业、文化教育事业和财政收入，也都取得了巨大的成就。进入1960年以来，工业生产更打破了历年来“月初低，月末高”的不正常现象，实现了开门红、日日红、全月红。农业生产在冬季大搞农田水利的基础上，正在掀起春季生产的新高潮。
    会议认为，为胜利完成1960年山东省的国民经济继续跃进计划，必须进一步大力开展生产、学习、技术革命和技术革新三大运动：
    在生产运动方面，要认真贯彻以农业为基础，在优先发展重工业的条件下实行工业农业同时并举的方针。为了实现农业生产跃进计划，必须继续贯彻以粮为纲，全面发展农、林、牧、副、渔的方针，大力展开“千（亩产千斤粮）百（亩产一百斤、二百斤皮棉，五百斤、六百斤花生）万（亩产万斤地瓜）斤大面积丰产方运动”和“每人一亩或二亩水利丰产田、每人一猪或每亩一猪的运动”。为促进农业生产全面、迅速地发展，应继续贯彻农业“八字宪法”，大搞农业的技术革命和技术革新。实现今年农业跃进计划的首要关键，在于抓好春季生产。加强麦田管理，保证春田适时播好种，打好1960年农业继续跃进的第一个战役。在争取农业全面、迅速发展的基础上，要加快轻工业的发展，提高产品质量，增加花色品种，以供应人民更多的生活必需品，并为重工业的加速发展积累资金。为了支援农业的技术改造和优先发展重工业，工业战线上必须继续贯彻以钢为纲、全面跃进的方针，进一步扩大重工业的基础，加强薄弱部门，更有力地支援农业、运输业和轻工业的建设。同时，还应努力促进交通运输工作、财贸工作、文教工作，使这几个方面的工作能够跟上工农业生产发展的需要。
    在技术革命和技术革新运动方面，会议指出：技术革命和技术革新，是党在社会主义建设中一项伟大的历史任务。以技术革命和技术革新为主要内容的社会主义劳动竞赛，已在全省国民经济的各个部门中广泛地开展着，这是各级党组织进一步领导技术革命和技术革新运动的大好形势。在当前开展技术革命和技术革新运动中，应当着重抓好如下几件工作：（一）认真地总结与提高开展技术革命和技术革新运动的经验，研究掌握运动的规律，把群众一点一滴的，一个工段、一个车间的革新创造，总结起来，并迅速推广。（二）大搞机械化、半机械化。（三）对农业上的技术革命和技术革新运动，应当足够地重视起来。农业上的技术革命，以深耕、排灌、收割、加工、运输为中心实行工具改革，逐步实现半机械化、机械化，同时要大力加强农业耕作技术改革。（四）认真做好资源调查工作。大力开展海产、海盐、煤炭、渔产、湖产等的综合利用。（五）努力发展尖端科学，带动尖端工业技术。（六）培养一支又红又专的科学技术队伍和理论队伍，建立和健全基地网，更好地组织力量，更快地开展工作。
    在学习运动方面，会议指出：目前革命和建设的实践向我们提出了一个庄严而迫切的任务，就是认真地学习毛泽东思想，以提高马克思列宁主义的理论水平，逐步学会运用毛泽东思想的武器，解决革命和建设中的实际问题和理论问题。积极宣传毛泽东思想，在广大人民群众中展开一个思想大革命。这不仅是做好当前一切工作的先决条件，而且是在六十年代取得持续跃进的根本保证。各级党的组织和党员、干部，必须进一步发扬群众路线的工作作风，深入实际，深入群众，深入生产过程，及时发现问题解决问题。并运用抓两头带中间的工作方法，一方面始终抓住前进的方向，一方面注意和帮助落后，切实解决落后单位的问题，及时突破薄弱环节，以促进整个工作和运动不断地向前发展。
    本报讯　千方百计加强农业战线，特别是在目前展开全党全民的抗旱斗争，夺取今年第一季丰收并作好春播，这是中共陕西省委二届十三次全体（扩大）会议的中心议题。
    这次会议5日开始，22日结束。会议着重解决了加强农业战线的认识和方针任务问题，又采用流动现场会议的方法，以七天时间走了五个县（渭南、大荔、蒲城、铜川、三原）到一些抗旱、夏田管理、春播准备、养猪积肥、工具改革等工作做得较好的基层单位去，边看、边议、边行，总结和推广了全省农业战线上许多先进经验，这样就把全省以抗旱为中心的夏田管理和春播准备工作，推向了一个新的高潮。会议还讨论确定了今年陕西地区国民经济计划建议草案，制订了培养科学技术队伍和理论队伍的初步规划，决定在全省开展一个十万红旗单位、百万红旗手运动等。会议号召在全省深入开展学习毛泽东思想的运动，把学习毛泽东思想的运动推向一个新的高潮。
    从各地汇报的情况和现场会议见到的情况看，到会同志一致认为，今年一开春，全省形势极好，是去年大跃进后的一个更大更全面的跃进形势。工业战线上出现了历史上没有过的开门红。全省人民公社在生产上，经过去年大旱仍然获得大丰收和冬季整顿之后，迈开了更大的跃进步伐。人民公社组织更大范围的协作，标志着人民公社大集体、大规模的生产走上了一个更加宏伟的新阶段，最后扫除过去在农村生产布局等方面个体经济等的残余，农村各项生产任务都比去年完成的又早、又快、又好。夏田管理在过好播种、越冬关以后，比去年提前一个月开始了返青关的战斗，麦苗生长比任何一年都好。棉田和秋田春播准备也都超过以往任何一年。今年由于养猪积肥运动的展开，到22日已超额原计划的52．54％。一个比去年秋季规模更大的抗旱运动正在全省展开。
    会议认为千方百计加强农业战线是高速度、按比例地发展社会主义经济，是实现今年全省继续跃进的中心环节。农业是国民经济发展的基础，在优先发展重工业的条件下，发展工业和农业同时并举，是党一贯的方针。坚决执行这一正确方针，陕西去年战胜了百日左右的大旱，获得了农业大丰收。农副业总产值比大跃进的1958年增长12％以上，农业的大跃进又促进了工业和其他事业的跃进，全省去年工业总产值比1958年增长48％，商品购进也增长了66％以上，商品供应增长了40．8％以上。因此，会议认为必须千方百计地加强农业战线，把农业放在首位，更快地发展农业，才能满足整个国民经济高速度发展的需要。为此，会议提出进一步贯彻以粮为纲五业并举全面跃进；大抓水、肥和田间管理，变全省三分之一耕地低产为高产；以工具改革和半机械化为中心，不断提高农业劳动生产率；进一步巩固和提高人民公社，工业、交通、商业、政法、文教各方面通力支援农业战线；树立雄心壮志，改进领导方法，等等措施。
    会议充分估计了当前的干旱威胁，认为在当前全力战胜干旱，誓夺今年第一季大丰收，作好春播为秋季大丰收打好基础，又是加强农业战线关键中的关键。全省继去年秋季百日左右大旱之后，又遭到去冬、今春一百多天的干旱，目前旱象还在继续发展，气温还在提高，土地耗墒很大。干旱严重地威胁着夏季作物生长和秋季作物的播种。会议确定，抗旱是目前最重要、最迫切、压倒一切的中心任务，要求全党全民立即紧急动员起来，战胜干旱，夺取第一季大丰收。为此要充分发挥一切水利设施和灌溉工具的效益，想尽一切办法增加灌溉设施；有水利设施的地区要力争多增产，适当扩大早秋播种面积和充分利用小块土地多种瓜菜；工、农、兵、学、商扭成一股劲支援抗旱，在支援抗旱夺取丰收中带动其他事业全面跃进。
    与会同志在参加了几个抗旱现场会议之后，一致得出结论：只要确立无雨保丰收的雄心壮志，依靠广大群众的干劲和智慧，就没有不能灌溉的土地。如大荔县苏村人民公社溢渡生产队大打机井，充分利用很深的地下水，实现高标准水利化，为平川抗旱保丰收树立了榜样。
    流曲人民公社在二万五千亩小麦丰产方，实行全方一盘棋，把七百八十八眼井并为二十五条渠道，作到了全方水利化。这些都为抗旱灌溉提供了丰富的经验。特别是蒲城县澄城人民公社卓里生产队引水上原的生动事例，大大地鼓舞了所有到会同志。这些经验和干劲，通过到会同志及时传播到全省各地以后，立即变成巨大的物质力量，全省抗旱运动很快走向了更高潮。到22日，全省的抗旱大军已由5日会议开始时的三十五万人猛增到三百一十六万人，超过去秋抗旱高潮时的56％。日灌面积也由5日的七十一万多亩增加到一百一十万亩，比去秋抗旱最高日灌面积还超过54％。
    到会同志在总结现场会议各先进单位和全省各地先进经验中，认为先进之所以先进，最根本的有两条：一是不断加强党的领导，迅速坚决贯彻党的路线、方针；一是继续贯彻群众路线，大搞群众运动。
    到会同志讨论中一致认为全省大跃进以来无数的事实都证明了，只要不断加强党的领导，迅速坚决执行党的指示，执行党中央、毛主席制订的党的路线方针，就能够多快好省的建设社会主义。为此，会议号召在全省展开学习毛泽东思想的运动，重视调查研究，总结经验，提高领导水平。
    到会同志从总结全省先进单位和现场会议的先进经验中还认为，进一步贯彻党的群众路线，放手发动群众，是实现今年继续跃进的中心问题。为了进一步放手发动群众，会议提出：必须坚决执行干部下放劳动锻炼，干部种试验田，实行两参一改三结合，并推行已行之有效的下放县、社、管区干部到生产队轮流担任副职的办法；下放干部的大多数都要派到落后队、穷队去，帮助改变落后队、穷队的面貌；要使大跃进中涌现的联系群众好、干劲十足、勇于克服困难、忠实于社会主义的贫农、下中农出身的积极分子，担任基层的领导职务；要大力支持新生事物，大力推广群众创造的各种先进经验；坚持又红又专的原则，推行“一主二副三结合”（生产、教育、科学研究三种不同单位，各以本业为主，其它两项为辅）的经验，搞好本部门工作，又培养出大量科学技术人材。
    会议认为，人民群众的干劲和创造精神，是高速度建设社会主义的根本力量。为了插红旗，竖标兵，大搞群众运动，把以技术革新和文化革命为中心内容的社会主义竞赛运动广泛开展起来，会议决定在全省开展一个十万红旗单位、百万红旗手的运动。（吴钢）
