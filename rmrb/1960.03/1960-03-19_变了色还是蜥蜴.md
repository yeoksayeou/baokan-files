Changed Color, Still a Lizard
　　Luoding

　　A few days ago, U.S. Vice President Nixon, at the Veterans Association, not only shamelessly boasted that the United States "will continue to be the most powerful military force in the world," but also reached the pinnacle of whitewashing the reactionary and corrupt capitalist system. He even said that the United States "has reached a state close to the communist ideal of 'abundance for all'."

　　Nixon has never concealed his extreme hatred of communism. In a speech he delivered on August 31 last year, he confessed that in the speeches he had given in previous years, he "talked about the threat of international communism to the peace and security of the United States every time," and that in the future, his "attitude of opposing communism at home and abroad will not change," and that "we must stand up and fight for our (capitalist) ideology." Now, only a few months later, Mr. Nixon is no longer worried about the "threat" of international communism, and boasts that the United States is also "close" to the "communist ideal"! Of course, this color-changing lizard Nixon will certainly not alarm the "Un-American Activities Committee" and the Central Intelligence Agency because of this; on the contrary, he may even receive praise and cheers.

　　As early as the 1920s, especially in the last ten years or so, the term capitalism has been adorned with countless colorful decorations in the United States, the most popular of which is "people's capitalism." The year before last, Wall Street darlings Lewis Kelso and Mortimer Adler even published a sensational "Capitalist Manifesto," proposing a so-called "clean" and "fair capitalism," and declared that "the purpose of the Capitalist Manifesto is to replace communism." However, it seems that these propagandas are far from being able to adapt to the needs of the United States today, because as long as the term capitalism cannot be discarded, it is still ugly, like flowers stuck in a pile of cow dung. Thus, Eisenhower personally sang a new tune during his trip to South America. He said: "The advocates of Marxism-Leninism try to denigrate the American system. They talk about 'exploited masses'. Indeed, anyone who has read history knows that there was often exploitation in the early days of capitalism, but it is ridiculous to insist that the situation in the American economy today is still the same as it was in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries." In Eisenhower's history, the exploitative nature of capitalism has long entered the historical museum, so there is no need to decorate it in any way. However, Eisenhower still cannot escape the confines of "people's capitalism," and he still cannot help but admit that the American system is a "socially conscious private enterprise system," under which "both employers and workers benefit." From this point of view, Nixon's "communism" cannot be said to be more thorough and straightforward than Eisenhower's "exploitation outdated" theory.

　　But Nixon should also be careful. The cruel reality that "people's capitalism" cannot cover up is equally ruthless to Nixon's "communism." Even the authors of the "Capitalist Manifesto" cannot help but admit that "a large amount of capital, which can produce about 90% of the national product, is concentrated in the hands of about 5% of entrepreneurs." As for the working people who are said to have "become capitalist magnates"? According to official U.S. materials, only one out of every hundred people who live on wages owns a little stock, and the more than four billion dollars worth of stock owned by the DuPont family alone is more than five times the total stock of all these so-called "capitalist magnates." At the same time, the annual salary of the general managers of large companies is as high as six to eight hundred thousand dollars, while the average annual income of three-quarters of American families is less than two thousand five hundred dollars. In addition, it is also worth looking at this figure: one out of every eight people in the United States lives in a slum. Here, is not Nixon's "communist ideal of abundance for all" more absurd and ridiculous than Eisenhower's so-called "theory" that no one in the United States has been exploited for a long time? Does Nixon really not know that not long ago, the 500,000 steelworkers' strike was suppressed, and now the United States has millions of unemployed and underemployed workers, as well as hundreds of thousands of farmers who live on meager relief food? What do all these mean? Doesn't it mean that what the United States is "close" to is nothing but the decay of the capitalist system!

　　Obviously, it cannot be said that the transition from "people's capitalism" to Eisenhower's "exploitation outdated" theory to Nixon's "communist ideal" is only to plaster over a moldy capitalist system. Nixon made it very clear that the United States is "waging a great ideological war" in an increasingly unfavorable situation, the purpose of which is to "maintain, protect and defend it (referring to capitalism), and help others to obtain it (referring to spreading capitalism in socialist countries where capitalism no longer exists)," the so-called "achievement of free progress." Eisenhower also openly declared: "As long as freedom (referring to capitalism) is suppressed and threatened anywhere in the world, the struggle will not stop." However, since even words like "people's capitalism" and "freedom" are no longer effective, and Nixon feels it is necessary to use the "communist ideal" as a guise, does this not suffice to illustrate the pathetic situation of the defenders of capitalism?

    变了色还是蜥蜴
    洛丁
    几天前，美国副总统尼克松在退伍军人协会上，不仅大言不惭地吹嘘美国“将继续是世界上最强大的军事力量”，而且在粉饰反动、腐朽的资本主义制度方面，到了登峰造极的地步。他竟说，美国“已达到接近于‘人人富足’的共产主义理想”了。
    尼克松是从来不掩饰他对共产主义的极端仇视的。他在去年8月31日发表的演说中，曾表白说，他前几年发表的演说，“每次都谈到国际共产主义对美国和平和安全的威胁”，并且在今后“反对国内外共产主义的态度不会改变”，“必须站起来为我们的（资本主义）思想意识而战”。而今相隔不过几个月，尼克松先生居然不再担心国际共产主义的“威胁”，吹嘘什么美国也“接近”了“共产主义理想”了！当然，尼克松这只会变色的蜥蜴决不会因此而惊动“非美活动委员会”和中央情报局的，恰恰相反，他可能还要受到赞叹和喝采呢。
    早在二十世纪的二十年代，特别是在最近十多年中，资本主义的词儿，在美国不知已经插上过多少五颜六色的花枝，最流行的要算是“人民资本主义”。前年，华尔街的宠儿们刘易斯·凯尔索和莫提默·阿德勒还发表了耸人听闻的“资本主义宣言”，提出所谓“干净的”、“公平的资本主义”，宣布“资本主义的宣言的目的是代替共产主义”。但是，看来这些宣传已远远不能适应美国今天的需要了，因为一天丢不掉资本主义的词儿，就像牛屎堆上插了花，还是丑的。于是，艾森豪威尔在这次南美之行中，就亲自唱出了新的调调儿。他是这样说的：“马克思列宁主义的鼓吹者企图贬低美国制度。他们说什么‘受剥削的群众’。的确，读过历史的人都知道，资本主义初期是常常有剥削的，但是，如果硬说今天的美国经济生活中仍然存在着十八世纪和十九世纪初期的情况，那就荒谬可笑了”。在艾森豪威尔的历史学中，资本主义的剥削性早已进了历史博物馆，当然就无须为它作什么装饰了。不过，艾森豪威尔毕竟还脱不出“人民资本主义”的窠臼，他依然不能不承认美国的制度是“具有社会意识的私有企业制度”，只是在这个制度下，“不论是雇主还是工人，都得到好处”。由此看来，尼克松的“共产主义”，不能不说是比艾森豪威尔的“剥削过时”论更彻底，更干脆。
    但是，尼克松也该当心点。“人民资本主义”所无法掩盖的残酷现实，对尼克松的“共产主义”同样是无情的。连“资本主义的宣言”的作者也不能不承认，“约能产生全国产品90％的大量资本集中在约5％的企业主手里”。至于所谓“已变成资本大王”的劳动人民呢？据美国官方材料，一百个靠工资生活的人中，只有一个人有一点点股票，而只是杜邦家族就拥有的四十亿美元以上的股票，等于所有这些所谓“资本大王”的股票总数的五倍多。同时，大公司的总经理的年薪多到六十至八十万美元，而美国四分之三的家庭全年收入平均低于二千五百美元。此外，还不妨看一看这个数字：美国八个人中就有一个人住在贫民窟里。在这里，尼克松的“人人富足的共产主义理想”，难道不是比艾森豪威尔所谓美国早已没有任何人受剥削的“理论”更荒谬可笑吗？尼克松难道真的不知道，不久之前五十万钢铁工人大罢工，受到了镇压，现在美国就有着几百万工人失业和半失业，以及几十万靠可怜的一点点救济粮糊口的农民，所有这些，又意味着什么呢？难道不是恰恰意味着美国“接近”的不是别的，只是资本主义制度的溃烂么！
    显然，决不能说，从“人民资本主义”，到艾森豪威尔的“剥削过时”论再到尼克松的“共产主义理想”，只是为了表糊发霉的资本主义制度。尼克松说得很清楚，美国是在日益不利的形势下，“展开一场巨大的思想战”，其目的是“保持、保护和保卫它（指资本主义），帮助其他人争取到它（指要在资本主义已经不存在的社会主义国家里传播资本主义）”，即所谓“取得自由的进展”。艾森豪威尔也公开宣称：“只要在世界的任何地方自由（指资本主义）受到压制和威胁，斗争就不会停止。”但是，既然连“人民资本主义”、“自由”之类的词儿，都已不顶用了，使得尼克松感到有必要搬用“共产主义理想”来作幌子，仅此一点，不就足以说明资本主义卫士们的可悲处境吗？
