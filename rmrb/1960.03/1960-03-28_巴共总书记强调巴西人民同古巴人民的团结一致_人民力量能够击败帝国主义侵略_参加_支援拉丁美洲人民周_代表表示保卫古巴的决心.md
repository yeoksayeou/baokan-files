Xinhua News Agency, Rio de Janeiro, March 27th: Brazilian Communist Party General Secretary Prestes emphasized the importance of solidarity with the Cuban people and the Cuban government at a meeting held in the Brazilian Press Association auditorium on the evening of the 25th to commemorate the 38th anniversary of the founding of the Brazilian Communist Party. He said: "We firmly believe that the Cuban revolution is our revolution, and the failure of Cuba will be our failure."

Prestes then said: "Cuba, as a small country, stood up in the face of powerful imperialist countries, declared independence, and has already achieved victory." He pointed out that some people say: "We in Brazil cannot fight against American monopoly capital groups, otherwise it would mean war." Prestes said that this statement is incorrect. He added: Since Cuba can stand up, why can't Brazil? After quoting Mao Zedong's words that all reactionaries and imperialists are "paper tigers," he said: Strength is on the side of the people who are fighting for independence, and no one is willing to tolerate the exploitation of monopoly capital groups any longer.

Referring to Eisenhower's trip to Latin America, Prestes pointed out that the purpose of this trip was to try to get Latin American countries to agree to intervene in Cuba.

In his speech, Prestes reviewed the history of the Brazilian Communist Party and pointed out that since its founding, the Brazilian Communist Party has been fighting against imperialism and capitalist oppression, and for land reform and the liberation of Brazil. He emphasized that the Communists have always advocated the unity of the Brazilian people regardless of their political views and religious beliefs, have always advocated the unity of the working class, and have always strived to fight for the progress of Brazil.

Prestes pointed out that the democratic spirit of the Brazilian people has laid the foundation for the legal status of the Brazilian Communist Party, and now only full legal status is lacking. He pointed out that the Brazilian communist movement has been greatly strengthened compared with 1945, when it obtained legal status.

Prestes said that the policy of the Brazilian Communist Party is to advocate the establishment of relations with the people of all countries, the establishment of national industries, the improvement of the people's living standards, land reform, and the struggle for the legal status of the working-class party. He pointed out that the current task is to unite all patriots of the Brazilian nationalist movement, and at the same time to unite the army. He also emphasized the urgent need to organize the vast peasant masses, who account for 68% of the Brazilian population.

Referring to the current presidential election campaign in Brazil, Prestes pointed out that the Communists support Marshal Lott and are working to eliminate the reactionaries in the Kubitschek government before the election.

Also speaking at the commemoration were Pereira, one of the founders of the Brazilian Communist Party, parliamentarians, workers, and student leaders. Santana, a member of the Nationalist Parliamentary Front, said: It is unreasonable to place the Communist Party, one of the main political forces in Brazil, in an illegal position. He said: The Brazilian parliament should restore the legal status of the Communist Party. Trade union leader Morena said that the Brazilian Communist Party is the only workers' party fighting for the liberation of Brazil.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 25th: Prominent social activists from various Latin American countries participating in the "Week of Support for the Latin American People" made statements to reporters, expressing the determination of people from all walks of life in Latin American countries to unite in the common struggle against American imperialism.

Lombardo Toledano, President of the Latin American Labor Federation, representing the Latin American working class, said that the current Cuban revolution is a life-and-death struggle against American imperialism, which has become the number one enemy hindering the historical development of the people of all Latin American countries.

Argentine famous novelist and peace fighter Alfredo Varela told reporters: Cuba has lit the torch, and our road is brighter than ever. The Argentine people are raising funds to donate an airplane to the Cuban people so that they can use it to defend their national sovereignty.

Jose Enamorado Cuesta, a veteran fighter for Puerto Rican independence who once took up arms to defend the Spanish Republic, said: The enemy of the two peoples is one: American imperialism. We should fight it together. We will surely win if we unite.

Pedro Mir, a famous poet from Dominica, where the armed struggle against dictatorship is increasingly developing, said: The central task of our peoples is to defend the Cuban revolution. The consolidation and progress of the Cuban revolution is a great victory for Latin America over American imperialism.

Orlando Capriles, representing the Indian tin miners of Bolivia and the national leadership of the Bolivian Workers' Central Labor Union Federation, said that if American imperialism dares to launch an armed invasion of Cuba, the Bolivian armed militia will go to Cuba to defend the Cuban revolution.

Mexican famous sculptor Arturo Garcia Bustos showed reporters his recent work praising the Cuban revolution. He said that in Mexico, even political prisoners have sent telegrams to the Cuban people to express their support. He emphasized that the cause of the Cuban people is the cause of all Latin America.

    巴共总书记强调巴西人民同古巴人民的团结一致
    人民力量能够击败帝国主义侵略
    参加“支援拉丁美洲人民周”代表表示保卫古巴的决心
    新华社27日讯　里约热内卢消息：巴西共产党总书记普列斯特斯25日晚间在巴西新闻协会礼堂举行的巴西共产党建党三十八周年纪念会上，强调同古巴人民和古巴政府团结一致的重要性。他说：“我们坚信，古巴的革命就是我们的革命，古巴的失败将是我们的失败”。
    普列斯特斯接着说：“作为小国的古巴在强大的帝国主义国家面前站了起来，宣告独立，而且已经取得胜利”。他指出，有些人说：“我们在巴西无法同美国垄断资本集团作斗争，否则就意味着战争”。普列斯特斯说，这种说法是不正确的。他又说：既然古巴能站起来，巴西为什么就不能呢？他在引述毛泽东所说的一切反动派和帝国主义者都是“纸老虎”的话之后说：力量是在争取独立的人民这一边，没有人愿意再容忍垄断资本集团的剥削。
    谈到艾森豪威尔的拉丁美洲之行时，普列斯特斯指出：此行的目的是设法使拉丁美洲国家同意干涉古巴。
    普列斯特斯在讲话中回顾了巴西共产党的历史，并且指出：巴西共产党自从建党以来，一直在为反对帝国主义和资本主义压迫，为争取土地改革和巴西的解放而斗争。他强调，共产党人始终主张巴西人民不论政治见解和宗教信仰如何团结一致，始终主张工人阶级的统一，始终竭力为争取巴西的进步而斗争。
    普列斯特斯指出：巴西人民的民主精神已使巴西共产党拥有合法地位的基础，现在只缺少全面的合法地位。他指出，同获得合法地位的1945年相比，目前巴西共产主义运动已大大加强了。
    普列斯特斯说：巴西共产党的政策是主张同一切国家的人民建立关系、建立民族工业、提高人民的生活水平、进行土地改革、争取工人阶级政党的合法地位。他指出：目前的任务是团结巴西民族主义运动的一切爱国者，同时团结军队。他还强调迫切需要把占巴西人口68％的广大农民群众组织起来。
    普列斯特斯在谈到巴西目前的总统竞选运动时指出，共产党人支持洛特元帅，并努力设法在选举之前排除库比契克政府中的反动分子。
    在纪念会上讲话的还有巴西共产党的创始人之一培列拉、议员、工人和学生领袖。民族主义议会阵线的议员桑塔纳说：把作为巴西的主要政治力量之一的共产党置于非法地位，是毫无道理的。他说：巴西议会应该恢复共产党的合法地位。工会领袖摩伦纳说，巴西共产党是争取巴西解放的唯一工人政党。
    据新华社哈瓦那25日电　参加“支援拉丁美洲人民周”活动的拉丁美洲各国著名社会活动家向记者发表谈话，表示拉丁美洲国家各阶层人民在反对美帝国主义的共同斗争中决心团结一致。
    拉丁美洲劳工联盟主席隆巴多·托列达诺代表拉丁美洲工人阶级表示，目前的古巴革命是反对美帝国主义的殊死斗争，美帝国主义已经成为阻碍拉丁美洲各国人民历史发展的头号敌人。
    阿根廷著名小说家和和平战士阿耳雷多·巴雷拉记者说：古巴燃起了火炬，我们的道路比以往任何时候都亮了。阿根廷人民正在集资捐献一架飞机给古巴人民，以便他们用来保卫自己国家的主权。
    争取波多黎各独立的老战士、曾经拿起武器保卫过西班牙共和国的诗人何塞·埃纳莫拉多·奎斯塔说：两国人民的敌人是一个：美帝国主义。我们应该一起同它斗争。我们联合起来就一定能够胜利。
    来自反独裁武装斗争日益发展的多米尼加的名诗人佩德罗·米尔说：我们各国人民的中心任务就是保卫古巴革命。古巴革命的巩固和进展就是拉丁美洲对美帝国主义的伟大胜利。
    玻利维亚工人中央工会联合会全国领导机构的奥尔兰多·卡普里莱斯代表这个国家的印第安人锡矿工人说，如果美帝国主义胆敢对古巴发动武装侵略，玻利维亚的武装民兵将开到古巴来保卫古巴革命。
    墨西哥著名雕刻家阿图罗·加西亚·布斯托斯给记者看了他赞扬古巴革命的近作。他说，在墨西哥，连政治犯都向古巴人民发出了声援他们的电报。他强调指出，古巴人的事业是全拉丁美洲的事业。
