Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch: Large quantities of supplies are being rapidly transported to rural areas, with commercial departments vigorously supporting drought resistance.

By the end of February, the Ministry of Commerce had increased or pre-allocated 59,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery and 1,237 water pumps to drought-stricken areas. In addition, it supplied a large number of transmission belts, rubber hoses, internal combustion engines and tractor parts, fertilizers, and pesticides to support drought resistance efforts in these regions. Commercial departments in Henan, Shanxi, Shandong, Gansu, Sichuan, Hebei, Guangdong, and other provinces had supplied more than 140,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery by mid-February, along with a large number of other supplies.

Under the unified leadership of the local Party committees, the commercial departments of these provinces established drought resistance offices, making the supply of drought resistance materials the overriding central task. They adopted methods such as inventory clearance, advance allocation, priority supply, production planning, organizing repairs and adjustments, and focusing on complete sets, to quickly transport drought resistance materials to rural areas. Employees of commercial warehousing departments in Shaanxi Province put forward the slogan "All work must make way for drought resistance; not a single second should be wasted in the stockpiling of drought resistance materials," prioritizing the packaging, inspection, and dispatch of these materials. Grassroots commercial units adopted methods such as combining mobile supply with fixed supply, and daytime delivery with nighttime delivery, to quickly deliver drought resistance materials to farmers.

Responding to the call of the Provincial Party Committee for "the entire Party and all the people to prevent and fight drought," commercial department employees in Guangdong Province promptly transferred large quantities of supplies to the drought resistance front lines. They also organized a large number of peddlers and service personnel to continuously serve the drought resistance forces at the front.

Commercial departments in various regions actively assisted communes and factories in arranging production plans for drought resistance tools, and supplied raw materials. Many regional commercial departments also adopted the method of adjusting inventories across different areas to provide all of the missing parts for the 1,500 horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery that were incomplete last year. Henan Province adjusted and substituted local materials to supply 4,453 water pumps and 200,000 *cun* meters of rubber hose. The province also launched a red banner competition in the entire commercial system, focused on completing the sets of irrigation and drainage machinery, striving to complete all of the existing 60,000 horsepower of incomplete irrigation and drainage machinery as soon as possible and supply them to rural areas in a timely manner.

Commercial departments in many regions, in conjunction with industrial departments, dispatched technicians to the countryside, collaborating with local blacksmiths and welders to set up repair stations or repair teams to go deep into the fields, repairing drought resistance machinery and farm tools to ensure the normal operation of the machines. Hebei Province recently carried out a crash inspection and repair of 161,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery, and Shandong Province repaired 100,000 waterwheels, all of which have been used for watering the land and combating drought. Four special districts in Henan Province—Nanyang, Kaifeng, Xinxiang, and Luoyang—transferred 5,200 people to the fields to repair tools, repairing 59,000 waterwheels and more than 2,900 irrigation and drainage machines in five days. The commercial departments of Kaifeng Special District helped communes train 300 technicians to use irrigation and drainage machinery. Sichuan Province also trained more than 3,000 technicians.

    大批物资迅速运到农村
    商业部门大力支援抗旱
    新华社7日讯　到2月底，商业部已增拨或提前调给有旱象地区的排灌机械五万九千马力，水泵一千二百三十七台。此外，还供应了大批传动带、胶管、内燃机和拖拉机配件、化肥、农药等，支援有旱象地区的抗旱斗争。河南、山西、山东、甘肃、四川、河北、广东等省的商业部门，到2月中旬已供应了排灌机械十四多万马力，还供应了大批其他物资。
    这些省的商业部门在当地党委统一领导下，成立了抗旱办公室，把做好抗旱物资的供应工作作为当前压倒一切的中心任务，并且采取清仓排队、提前调拨、优先供应、安排生产、组织修补调剂、大抓配套等办法，迅速将抗旱物资运往农村。陕西省商业仓储部门职工提出“一切工作为抗旱让路，不让抗旱物资积压一分一秒”的口号，对抗旱物资优先包装、优先验收、优先发运。基层商业单位采用流动供应与固定供应相结合，白天送货与夜晚送货相结合等办法，把抗旱物资很快送到农民手中。
    广东省商业部门职工响应省委提出的“全党全民防旱抗旱”号召，及时把大批物资调到抗旱前线，并且组织大批货郎担、服务业人员源源上前线为抗旱大军服务。
    各地商业部门积极协助公社、工厂安排好生产抗旱工具规划，并供应原料材料。不少地区的商业部门还采用调剂各地库存的办法，把去年不配套的一千五百马力的排灌机械全部配了套。河南省通过调剂、以土代洋等办法，调剂了水泵四千四百五十三台，胶管二十万寸米，并且在全省商业系统开展了以做好排灌机械配套工作为内容的红旗竞赛，力争尽快地把现有配套不全的六万马力排灌机械全部配成套，及时供应农村。
    许多地区的商业部门协同工业部门派遣技术人员下乡，配合当地的铁匠、焊匠等，设立修配站或修理组深入田间，修补抗旱机械和农具，保证机器正常运转。河北省最近突击检修了排灌机械十六万一千马力，山东省检修好水车十万部，都已用于浇地抗旱。河南省南阳、开封、新乡、洛阳四个专区抽调了五千二百多人到田间修理工具，五天内修好水车五万九千部，排灌机械二千九百多台。开封专区商业部门帮助公社训练了三百个使用排灌机械的技术人员。四川省也培训了三千多技术人员。
