Xinhua News Agency, March 19th. The China Peace Committee cabled peace organizations in Latin American countries for the "Week of Support for the People of Latin America." The full text is as follows:

    As mass organizations and people from all walks of life in Latin America hold the "Week of Support for the People of Latin America," the China Peace Committee, on behalf of the Chinese people, extends its firmest support to the people of Latin American countries who are struggling against U.S. interference and for the defense of national independence, and warmly congratulates the people of Latin American countries on their righteous struggle against U.S. imperialism and for the defense of world peace for further victories.

    For more than a century, U.S. imperialism has unscrupulously oppressed and exploited the people of Latin America and plundered the wealth of Latin America. We are pleased to see that 200 million Latin American people have awakened and have bravely embarked on the path of struggle. The victory of the Cuban people's revolution and the surging development of the national democratic movement in Latin American countries are powerfully impacting U.S. control over Latin America. The struggle of the Latin American people against U.S. monopoly capital and war forces has made a great contribution to the defense of world peace and has been hailed and supported by peace-loving people all over the world. In the face of this situation, U.S. imperialism, in addition to intensifying political subversion and economic threats, has recently continuously bombed Cuban sugar mills and sugarcane fields, conducted military exercises in the Caribbean Sea threatening Cuba, created an ammunition explosion in Havana Harbor, and is plotting and preparing for armed intervention against Cuba and other Latin American countries. This hideous face of the United States fully proves that the United States is a fierce enemy of the Latin American people in defending independence, democracy, and peace, and is a common enemy of all peace-loving people in the world.

    The Chinese people have always deeply sympathized with and firmly supported the struggle of the Latin American people against U.S. interference, for the defense of national sovereignty, and against U.S.-backed dictatorial regimes. Our 650 million people will always stand with the people of Latin America in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and for the defense of world peace. We firmly believe that in today's world, with the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union unprecedentedly strong, and with the forces of peace and the national independence movement rising day by day, as long as the people of Latin American countries strengthen unity and fight unyieldingly, victory will surely belong to the great Latin American people.

    中国人民永远和拉丁美洲人民在一起
    我国各人民团体致电热烈祝贺“支援拉丁美洲人民周”
    阿根廷等国著名人士来电祝贺中国拉丁美洲友协成立
    新华社19日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会为“支援拉丁美洲人民周”致拉丁美洲各国和平组织电。全文如下：
    在拉丁美洲的群众组织和各阶层人民举行“支援拉丁美洲人民周”之际，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会代表中国人民谨向为反对美国干涉、维护民族独立而斗争的拉丁美洲各国人民表示最坚决的支持，并热烈祝贺拉丁美洲各国人民反对美帝国主义、维护世界和平的正义斗争取得进一步的胜利。
    一个多世纪以来，美国帝国主义肆无忌惮地压迫剥削拉丁美洲人民、掠夺拉丁美洲财富。我们高兴地看到两亿拉丁美洲人民已经觉醒了，并英勇地走上了斗争的道路。古巴人民革命的胜利，拉丁美洲各国民族民主运动汹涌澎湃地向前发展，正在有力地冲击着美国对拉丁美洲的控制。拉丁美洲人民反对美国垄断资本和战争势力的斗争，对保卫世界和平作出了巨大的贡献，受到了全世界爱好和平的人民的欢呼和支持。面对着这种形势，美帝国主义除加紧进行政治颠覆和经济威胁外，最近不断轰炸古巴糖厂和蔗田，在加勒比海进行威胁古巴的军事演习，在哈瓦那港制造军火爆炸事件，并阴谋策划和准备对古巴及其他拉丁美洲国家进行武装干涉。美国这种狰狞面目充分证明美国是拉丁美洲人民维护独立、民主与和平的凶恶敌人，是全世界爱好和平的人民的共同敌人。
    中国人民一向深切同情并坚决支持拉丁美洲人民反对美国干涉、维护民族主权和反对美国扶植的独裁政权的斗争。我国六亿五千万人民在反对美国帝国主义、维护世界和平的斗争中永远和拉丁美洲人民在一起。我们深信，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营空前强大，和平力量和民族独立运动日益高涨的今天，只要拉丁美洲各国人民加强团结、不屈不挠地进行斗争，胜利必将属于伟大的拉丁美洲人民。中国人民保卫世界和平委员会
