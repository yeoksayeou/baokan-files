　　Close Friends

　　Close friends are based on deep friendship. The Chinese have always admired so-called intimate friends since ancient times. However, true close friends are emerging today.

　　Different societies have different content for friendship. The "Oath of the Peach Garden" can be called friendship, but its purpose was to maintain the traditional feudal rule. The bourgeoisie also emphasizes "sworn brotherhood," but its foundation is built on money, and it cannot avoid internal strife for personal gain, so this kind of "friendship" is extremely unstable. To speak of true close friends, one must consider the proletariat. Because the proletariat makes friends, not for money, nor for personal gain, but out of complete selflessness. For the sake of a common and beautiful cause, no matter how violent the wind and snow, no matter how inconvenient it is for oneself, as long as it is beneficial to the common cause, one must overcome a thousand difficulties and ten thousand difficulties to do it. Ding Yuqing of the Benxi Coal Mine Amateur School is a person with this style. With this style, one can shorten the distance between oneself and the masses and truly become a close friend of the masses.

　　This new type of mutual assistance and cooperation between people, on the liberated land of China, under the shining of Mao Zedong Thought, its foundation is becoming more and more solid, and its scope is also expanding. The General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes have pushed this relationship to a new height. Workers and peasants, cadres and the masses, intellectuals and the working people, doctors and patients, teachers and students... are all close friends. The friendship between female miner teacher Ding Yuqing and the workers is just a movement and episode in this great symphony of friendship. But, this is a beautiful movement, a moving episode! In order to teach students well, Ding Yuqing visited workers' residences, went down into the mines, worked as a "nurse," taught both books and people, and managed workers' lives while compiling teaching materials. She formed a close friendship with the miners, helped more than 800 miners shed their illiteracy, and became a cultural seed-planter for Benxi Coal Mine.

　　In our great motherland, there are tens of thousands of Ding Yuqing-like figures. In the future, the motherland will need more Ding Yuqing-like figures! We must carry forward this revolutionary spirit, make friends with workers, make friends with peasants, learn the noble qualities of the workers and peasants, spread cultural and scientific knowledge to them, and make our cultural revolution more vigorous and developed to meet the needs of the technological revolution.

### 知心朋友

    知心朋友
    知心朋友，是以深厚的友谊为基础的。中国人自古就崇尚所谓莫逆之交。但是，真正的知心朋友，是出在今天。
    社会不同，朋友的内容也各有差异。“桃园三结义”，可称得起朋友，但它的目的是为了维持传统的封建统治。资产阶级也讲究“金兰之交”，但它的基础是建立在金钱之上，不能避免为私利而勾心斗角，因而这种“友谊”也极不巩固。要说真正的知心朋友，还得算无产阶级。因为无产阶级交朋友，一不为金钱，二不为私利，而是大公无私。为了共同的美好的事业，不管风雪如何狂暴，不管对自己如何不方便，只要对共同事业有利，克服一千个困难、一万个困难，也要去做。本溪煤矿业余学校的丁玉清，就是具有这种风格的人。有了这种风格，才能缩短自己和群众的距离，真正成为群众的知心朋友。
    这种新型的人与人之间互助合作的关系，在解放了的中国土地上，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，它的基础越来越巩固，它的范围也越来越扩大了。总路线、大跃进和人民公社，把这种关系又推到了新的高度。工人和农民，干部和群众，知识分子和劳动人民，大夫和病人，老师和学生……，都是知心朋友。矿山女教师丁玉清和工人的朋友关系，只不过是这种伟大友谊交响乐中的一个乐章和插曲。但，这是美丽的乐章，动人的插曲！为了教好学生，丁玉清访问过工人住宅，下过矿井，当过“护士”，教书也教人，编教材也管工人生活。她，和矿工结成了亲密的朋友，帮助八百多矿工摘掉了文盲帽子，成为本溪煤矿的文化播种者。
    在我们伟大的祖国，有着成千上万丁玉清式的人物。今后，祖国还需要更多的丁玉清式的人物！我们要发扬这种革命精神，和工人交朋友，和农民交朋友，学习工农群众的高贵品质，向他们传播文化科学知识，使我国的文化革命更加蓬勃发展，以适应技术革命的需要。
