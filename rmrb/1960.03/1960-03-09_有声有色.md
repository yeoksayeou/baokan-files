Every day on my way to and from work, I see an old woman with a long broom, sweeping in that remote alley. This old woman is around fifty years old, a representative of the neighborhood, an urban working-class person whose son is at the front lines in Fujian. This alley is a blind spot in the sanitation campaign. There are few residents but many pedestrians, and leaves, scraps of grass, fruit peels, mud, and the like accumulate every day. And that old woman sweeps every day without fail.

The old woman sweeps in the alley every day. Passersby see her but don't know her name, and may not even value her ordinary work. To strangers, she is nameless, doing "silent and colorless" work. However, it is precisely people like her who make our days more joyful. In the city where I live, before liberation, flies swarmed, and even in the dead of winter, mosquitoes would come out to bite people during the day. Cholera would have a minor epidemic every three years and a major epidemic every five years. But now, these things have been completely eradicated, and that is related to the countless old women like her. Like diligent gardeners, they weed and water, day and night, beautifying our garden to make it magnificent, allowing us to breathe fresh air.

Is it really silent? Not necessarily. Our endeavors are all vocal. Whether it is steelmaking, sweeping, driving a tractor, or raising pigs, they are all resounding. These are all concrete actions, announcing to the world: We are building socialism! We are working for the happiness of mankind! This sound floats over rooftops, sweeps across fields, this sound shakes mountains and moves the earth. In the past, some people said we were a "silent China," but now our socialist construction is leaping forward, and the paeans of the working people resound through the clouds. Silence turns into sound, small sound becomes loud sound, enough to shock and terrify the imperialist gentlemen.

Saying it's colorless is also wrong. In the socialist era, any matter, no matter how ordinary or small, is not dull and colorless, but bright and splendid. Doing what the Party and the people want to do, doing some work that no one has ever done before, taking roads that no one has ever traveled before, and doing things that our predecessors could not do, is extremely outstanding. On our vast land, whether it is in workshops or fields, whether it is a collective or an individual, everything is brightly colored, all red, a good start, red every month, red to the end, red flags fluttering, and red light filling the sky.

Saying it's nameless? Actually, it is famous. Comrades working hard on all fronts, whether skilled or novice, whether technicians or laborers, all have a name, "People of the Socialist Era," that is their name. This name is radiant and immortal. This name is an invincible flower, blooming forever in our era's garden.

The old woman sweeping in the alley is a person with sound, color, and great aspirations. She has the sound and color of socialism, and she has established the great ambition to dedicate herself to socialism and the people. The red heart beating in her chest drives her, enabling her to do the great, earth-shaking cause together with her son at the front.

    有声有色
    谢逸
    我每天上班下班，都看见一位老大娘拿着长扫把，在那条偏僻的小巷里扫地。这老大娘五十岁左右，是街道的代表，城市贫民，儿子在福建前线。这条小巷是卫生运动中的空白点，住户少，行人多，落叶、碎草、果皮、泥巴之类，天天都有，而那老大娘也天天在扫，没有中止。
    老大娘每天在小巷里扫着扫着，行人路过看见了她，却不知道她的名字，脑子里也未必都重视她这一普通的工作，对陌生的人来说，她是个无名者，做着“无声无色”的工作。但是，正是他们，使人们的日子过得一天比一天欢愉。我所居住的这个城市，解放前苍蝇成群，大寒天还有蚊子白日出来咬人，霍乱是三年一小流行，五年一大流行。而现在，这些东西都给消灭得干干净净了，这就是和许许多多的老大娘有关的。她们像辛勤的园丁一样，除草浇水，日夜不息，而将我们这座花园修整得绚烂瑰丽，使我们能够呼吸着清新的空气。
    真是无声么？并不见得，我们的事业都是有声的。不管是炼钢，是扫地，是开拖拉机，还是养猪，都是响当当的。这都是用具体行动，向全世界宣布：我们在建设社会主义！我们在为人类谋幸福！这声音飘过屋顶，掠过田野，这声音威震山岳，惊天动地。过去有人说我们是“无声的中国”，但是现在我们的社会主义建设事业正在飞跃前进，劳动人民的凯歌响彻云霄。无声变有声，小声变大声，足以使帝国主义老爷们吃惊、发抖。
    说是无色，这也不对。社会主义时代里的任何一件事，不管你是如何的普通，如何的微小，都不是暗然无色，而是光辉灿烂；做党和人民所要做的事，干一些人所没干过的活，走前人所没有走过的路，做前人所做不到的事，这就非常出色。在我们辽阔的土地上，不论是车间田野，不论集体或是个人，都是色彩鲜明，一派红色，开门红，月月红，红到底，红旗飘飘，红光满天。
    说是无名么？其实是有名。在各个战线上辛勤工作着的同志，不管是熟练的还是生手，不管是技工还是杂工，都有一个名字，“社会主义时代的人”，就是他们的名字。这名字光芒万丈，永垂不朽。这名字是不败的花朵，永远盛开在我们的时代园地里。
    小巷里扫地的老大娘，是一个有声有色有大志的人物。她有社会主义之声、之色，她树立了为社会主义、为人民群众而献身的大志。她胸中那颗跳动不止的红心推动了她，使她能和在前线的儿子一样，共同在做着翻天复地的伟大事业。
