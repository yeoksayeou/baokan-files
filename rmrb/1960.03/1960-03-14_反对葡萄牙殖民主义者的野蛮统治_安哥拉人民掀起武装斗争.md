Xinhua News Agency, March 13th, Paris Dispatch: According to a report in the French "Echo," armed resistance struggles against Portuguese colonial rule have recently erupted in many cities in northern Angola, Africa. The Portuguese colonialists dispatched troops to suppress them, but the situation there remains tense.

The newspaper reported on the 10th that the armed uprising was led by an underground nationalist organization demanding independence.

Regarding the scale of the uprising, the newspaper pointed out that for two years, incidents had repeatedly occurred in the area of Angola near the Belgian Congo, but they were often only local events. This time, the uprising has affected almost the entire northern region of Angola.

According to Western news agencies, two officials from the American Committee on Africa who recently visited Angola also said at a press conference that Angolan nationalists are engaged in armed struggle. They said that in the southern and northern regions of Angola, people have been fighting armed struggles against Portuguese rulers and colonialists.

According to earlier news reports, Portuguese colonialists recently transferred a large number of troops from mainland Portugal to Angola to carry out suppression. It is said that two battalions have been sent to the areas of Angola bordering the Belgian Congo and Northern Rhodesia, respectively.

Angola is located in southwestern Africa and has a population of over four million. For hundreds of years, Portuguese colonialists have subjected the Angolan people to extremely brutal exploitation and oppression. The slightest expression of dissatisfaction by the Angolan people is met with savage repression, all nationalist organizations are banned, and large numbers of Africans are imprisoned. At the same time, various "blockades" are implemented in an attempt to isolate the Angolan people from the outside world. However, under the impact of the increasingly high tide of the African nationalist movement, all this cannot stop the awakening of the Angolan people and the continuous development of the national movement.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Abdul Gassim, a leader of the Angolan independence movement in Portuguese Angola, exposed the brutal colonial rule of Portuguese colonialists in Angola, Africa, at a press conference held in London on the 4th. He pointed out that the more than four million Africans under Portuguese rule have been living like slaves and have been deprived of the most basic human rights.

Abdul Gassim said that in this Portuguese colony, the killing, arrest, sentencing, and outright "disappearance" of Africans are commonplace. In Luanda, the capital of Angola, a fascist colonial court presided over by a white "immigrant" is preparing to try dozens of Africans, whose "crime" is that they participated in this or that people's nationalist group.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Algerian National Liberation Front's organ, "El Moudjahid," recently published an article exposing the brutal colonial rule of Portuguese colonialists over the Angolan people. The article said that since March 1959, Portuguese colonialists have been carrying out a series of arrests throughout Angola. In Luanda, more than one hundred and fifty Angolans have been imprisoned by the Portuguese political police.

The article went on to talk about the enslavement and exploitation of the Angolan people by the Portuguese colonialists. 7% of the African wage laborers in Angola are forced laborers. The article said that Africans are also prohibited from owning private land in their own country.

The article pointed out that Portuguese and other foreign companies in Angola have obtained huge profits. For example, the total net profit exploited by six enterprises such as the Bank of Angola, the Angola Agricultural Company, and the Angola Sugar Company by the end of 1957 amounted to 334,730,000 escudos (equivalent to 48 billion francs).

### 反对葡萄牙殖民主义者的野蛮统治  安哥拉人民掀起武装斗争

    反对葡萄牙殖民主义者的野蛮统治
    安哥拉人民掀起武装斗争
    新华社13日讯　巴黎消息：据法国“回声报”报道，在非洲安哥拉北部的许多城市，最近爆发了当地人民武装反抗葡萄牙殖民统治的斗争。葡萄牙殖民者派遣军队去镇压，但是那里的局势仍然很紧张。
    这家报纸10日报道，这次武装暴动是由一个要求独立的地下民族主义组织领导的。
    这家报纸在谈到这次暴动规模时指出，两年来，在安哥拉靠近比属刚果一带，曾经屡次发生事件，但往往只是局部的事件。这一次，暴动几乎波及整个安哥拉北部地区。
    据西方通讯社报道，最近曾到安哥拉进行活动的美国非洲委员会两名负责人在一次记者招待会上也说，安哥拉民族主义者正在进行武装斗争。他们说，在安哥拉南部和北部地区，人民进行了武装反对葡萄牙统治者和殖民者的斗争。
    据早些时候的消息报道，葡萄牙殖民者最近从葡萄牙本土调了大批军队到安哥拉去进行镇压。据说，已经有两个营分别派到安哥拉同比属刚果和北罗得西亚接壤的地方去。
    安哥拉位于非洲西南部，人口四百多万。几百年来葡萄牙殖民者对安哥拉人民进行了极端残酷的剥削和压迫。安哥拉人民稍为表示一点不满就遭到野蛮的镇压，一切民族主义组织都被禁止，大批的非洲人被关进监狱。同时还实行各种“封锁”，企图使安哥拉人民同外界隔绝。但是在日益高涨的非洲民族主义运动浪潮的冲击下，这一切也阻挡不住安哥拉人民的觉醒和民族运动的不断发展。
    据新华社讯　葡属安哥拉独立运动领袖阿卜杜勒·贾西，4日在伦敦举行的一次记者招待会上揭露葡萄牙殖民者在非洲安哥拉的残酷殖民统治状况。他指出，葡萄牙统治下的四百多万非洲人一直像奴隶一样生活，并且被剥夺了最基本的人权。
    阿卜杜勒·贾西说，在这个葡萄牙殖民地中，非洲人被屠杀、逮捕、判徒刑和干脆“失迹”的事情，是司空见惯的。在安哥拉首府卢安达，由一个白人“移民”当庭长的法西斯殖民法庭准备对几十个非洲人进行审判，这些非洲人的“罪名”是因为他们参加了这个或那个人民民族主义团体。
    据新华社讯　阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线机关刊物“圣战者报”最近发表文章揭露葡萄牙殖民者对安哥拉人民的残酷殖民统治。文章说，自从1959年3月以来，葡萄牙殖民者不断在安哥拉各地进行一系列的逮捕。在卢安达，有一百五十多个安哥拉人被葡萄牙政治警察监禁在狱中。
    文章接着谈到葡萄牙殖民者对安哥拉人民的奴役和剥削。在安哥拉非洲工资劳动者的7％是强迫劳动者。文章说，在自己的国家里，非洲人还被禁止私人拥有土地。
    文章指出，在安哥拉的葡萄牙和其它国家的公司获得了巨额利润。如安哥拉银行、安哥拉农业公司、安哥拉糖业公司等六家企业到1957年底所剥削得来的纯利润总额达三亿三千四百七十三万埃斯库多（合四百八十亿法郎）。（附图片）
