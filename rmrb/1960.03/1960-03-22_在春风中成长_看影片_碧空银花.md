Growing Up in the Spring Breeze
    ——Watching the Film "Azure Sky, Silver Flowers"

    The films "Woman Basketball Player No. 5" and "Icebound Sisters," which take sports as their subject matter, are two successful works. Recently, we were pleased to see "Azure Sky, Silver Flowers," a color feature film produced by the Xi'an Film Studio, depicting the growth of China's first group of female parachute athletes.

    Parachuting is one of the significant national defense sports projects that has been developed in our country in recent years. Engaging in this sport requires not only a strong physique, but also a tenacious and unyielding willpower. Under the leadership of the Party, parachuting, which is honorably called "the sport of the brave," is attracting more and more female athletes to participate. A group of outstanding female parachute athletes has already been cultivated. The playwright chose this novel subject matter, which not only reflects the rapid development of China's sports, but also shows the characteristics of our era.

    The film opens with a wonderful and moving parachute performance, with朵朵傘花 (duǒduǒ sǎn huā, literally: umbrella flowers)飘在高空 floating in the high sky, landing on the rippling sea. The parachute athletes appearing before the audience are not brave and powerful men, but a group of girls who still appear somewhat naive. From them, one can no longer find a trace of "fragility." Their healthy images deeply attract people. Through the joys and worries, trials and tribulations of the female parachute athletes in their training lives, the film portrays several relatively distinct personalities.

    Lin Ping, an athlete from a working-class background, possesses the firm, selfless and excellent qualities of the working class. In training, she is diligent, brave, disciplined, and cares for the comrades around her. When she discovers that Bai Ying, a young student who usually quarrels with her, is considering more personal gains and losses, leaving a note and leaving the aviation club without saying goodbye, she is very angry, but out of a sense of responsibility to her comrades, she brings Bai Ying back. When the parachute team is carrying out the task of extinguishing forest fires, she disregards her own safety and resolutely cuts the parachute rope tangled with Bai Ying in mid-air in order to ensure the safe landing of her comrades. This communist style of caring for collective honor and sacrificing oneself for others in times of crisis is not only a quality that athletes should possess, but also a quality that each of us should possess.

    From the character of Bai Ying, we can recognize that, today, if one puts personal honor first, lacks collectivist spirit, and adopts an indifferent attitude towards the comrades around one, one will accomplish nothing, and even embark on the wrong path. However, the Party always cares for us, and the comrades also love us. If one can recognize one's mistakes, and resolve to correct them early with the help and education of the Party and the collective, one will certainly be able to make progress and grow rapidly like Bai Ying.

    However, the film's portrayal of Bai Ying's ideological transformation process is still relatively simple.

    在春风中成长
    ——看影片“碧空银花”
    许文
    以体育运动为题材的影片“女篮5号”和“冰上姐妹”，是两部成功的作品。最近我们又高兴地看到了西安电影制片厂摄制的、描写我国第一批女子跳伞运动员成长的彩色故事片“碧空银花”。
    跳伞运动，是近几年来才在我国开展起来的有重大意义的国防体育项目之一。从事这项运动，非但要有坚强的体格，更需要坚韧不拔的毅力。在党的领导下，跳伞这一项被光荣地称为“勇敢者的运动”，吸引着愈来愈多的女运动员的参加。一批优秀的女跳伞运动员，已经培养出来了。剧作者选择了这个新颖的题材，不仅反映了我国体育运动事业的飞跃发展，也显示了我们时代的特征。
    影片一开始，是一场精彩动人的跳伞表演，高空飘着朵朵伞花，降落在碧波荡漾的海面。出现在观众面前的跳伞运动员们，并不是勇武有力的男子汉，而是一群还显得有些稚气的姑娘。从她们的身上，再也找不到一丝“弱不经风”的影子。她们健壮的形象深深吸引住人们。影片通过女跳伞手们在锻炼生活中的欢乐和忧虑，考验和波折，描绘出了几个比较鲜明的性格。
    青年工人出身的运动员林萍，具有工人阶级的坚定的、大公无私的优秀品质，在锻炼中她勤劳，勇敢，遵守纪律，关心周围的同志。当她发现平时和她闹别扭的白英——一个较多考虑个人得失的青年学生，留下字条，不辞而别，离开航空俱乐部的时候，她虽然十分气愤，但是出于对同志的责任感，她把白英找了回来。当跳伞队执行扑救森林火灾的任务时，她不顾自己的安危，为了使自己的同志安全降落，毅然在半空中割断和白英缠在一起的伞绳。这种关心集体荣誉，在危难中舍己为人的共产主义风格，不仅是运动员，也是我们每一个人应当具备的品质。
    我们从白英这个人物的身上，能够认识到，在今天，如果把个人的荣誉放在第一位，缺乏集体主义精神，对周围的同志采取漠不关心的态度，她就会一事无成，甚至走上错误的道路。但是，党总是关怀我们的，同志们也是热爱我们的，如果能认识错误，及早在党和集体的帮助教育下决心改正，也一定能够像白英这样，得到进步，迅速成长。
    不过，影片对白英的思想转变过程表现得还是比较简单了一些。
