By every possible means, expand the cotton field area and increase the unit yield.
Xinjiang's cotton planting plan is implemented down to the team level.
All cotton-growing areas are preparing for timely sowing by advancing land preparation, spring irrigation, plowing, and harrowing to preserve moisture.
Urumqi Dispatch from our newspaper, March 17th: In Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, all cotton-producing areas are actively expanding cotton fields under the premise of prioritizing grain and ensuring the expansion of grain crop areas. The confirmed cotton field planting area, allocated down to the team level, is 26.6% larger than last year's cotton field planting area.

To meet the state's need for developing cotton production, all cotton-producing areas in Xinjiang have made expanding cotton fields and increasing cotton yield per unit area the focus of discussions in the 1960 agricultural production plan, devising many methods to expand cotton fields. The military reclamation farms distributed across the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains are actively adopting methods such as crop rotation, soil improvement, square-hole planting, horizontal thinning, and reforming cotton planting tools this year. On the basis of increasing labor productivity, they are selecting good land and expanding cotton fields. According to the recent preparations of each farm, the total cotton field planting area in each reclamation area this year will nearly double compared to last year. People's communes in the vast rural areas south of the Tianshan Mountains are also actively engaging in water conservancy projects, reclaiming wasteland, and constructing drainage ditch networks to improve soil, in order to expand cotton fields. They are expanding grain crops on newly reclaimed wasteland, freeing up and improving more good land to expand cotton fields. The cotton fields planned for planting this year in Aksu and Hotan prefectures have increased by 23% to 26% respectively compared to last year.

Currently, the majority of cotton field planting plans in all cotton-producing areas have been implemented down to the team level, and the planting plans in key areas and large-area cotton fields have been largely implemented down to the field level. Because this work was grasped early this year, key cotton-growing counties such as Turpan, Shanshan, Makit, Kuqa, and Moyu have not only implemented the cotton planting plan down to the field in advance but have also planned cotton-growing areas on a production team basis, with most cotton fields reaching 200-300 mu to 700-800 mu. This not only facilitates field management and centralized pest control but, more importantly, connects large areas of high-yield fields with large fields, facilitating the timely promotion of experience and driving large field production.

This year, while focusing on expanding cotton fields, all localities are also paying special attention to increasing cotton yield per unit area, determined to vigorously promote technical innovation in cotton planting and strive to plant one mu and harvest it well. To achieve this plan, all cotton-growing areas are building on the early and effective preparatory work done this year, redoubling their efforts, and carrying out land preparation, spring irrigation, plowing, and harrowing to preserve moisture as early as possible. The people's communes in the hot and extremely water-deficient Turpan Basin have, for more than half a month, been seizing the early spring slack water to irrigate cotton fields that were not thoroughly irrigated in winter, combining spring irrigation with harrowing to preserve moisture, so that these cotton fields can be plowed and sown without watering before sowing. Makit County, which achieved an average yield of over 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu last year, has recently broken with convention, based on the basic completion of preparatory work, and is plowing while spreading fertilizer in advance. More than 70,000 Uygur farmers in the county are determined to plow, level, and preserve moisture in all cotton fields before sowing, so as to concentrate manpower and animal power within a week and sow all cotton fields in a timely manner. Zepu County, which has decided to double its cotton field area this year, has signed a contract for guaranteed teaching and learning with neighboring Makit County, which has experience in cotton planting, in order to plant and manage all cotton fields well. It has transferred 114 outstanding commune members from 114 production teams throughout the county to Makit County to learn cotton planting experience, and Makit County has also transferred 114 commune members with cotton planting experience from various communes to Zepu County to impart cotton planting technology.

### 千方百计扩大棉田面积提高单位产量  新疆棉花播种计划落实到队

    千方百计扩大棉田面积提高单位产量
    新疆棉花播种计划落实到队
    各植棉区提早整地、春灌、犁地、耙磨保墒，准备及时播种
    本报乌鲁木齐17日电　新疆维吾尔自治区各产棉区在以粮为纲、保证扩大粮食作物面积的前提下，积极扩大棉田。棉田播种面积已经落实到队的数字，比去年棉田种植面积扩大26．6％。
    新疆各产棉区为了适应国家对发展棉花生产的需要，都在讨论1960年农业生产计划中，把扩大棉田和提高棉花单位面积产量作为讨论的中心之一，想了许多办法扩大棉田。分布在天山南北的各军垦农场，今年都积极采取倒槎、改良土壤、方形窝播、横向间苗、改革植棉工具等办法，在提高劳动生产率的基础上，选择好地，扩大棉田。根据最近各场的准备情况看，今年各垦区的棉田播种总面积，将比去年扩大近一倍。天山以南广大农村各人民公社，也都根据气候干旱、雨水异常缺乏、盐碱土地较多的自然条件，大兴水利，开荒造田，兴修排碱沟网改良土壤，在新开的荒地上扩种粮食作物，腾出和改良出更多的好地来扩大棉田。阿克苏、和阗专区今年决定种植的棉田，分别比去年扩大了23％到26％。
    目前，各产棉区棉田播种计划绝大部分已经落实到队，重点地区和大面积棉田的播种计划绝大部分已经落实到田。今年由于这一工作抓的早，吐鲁番、鄯善、麦盖提、库车、墨玉等重点植棉县，不仅已提前把棉花播种计划落实到田，并且都以生产队为单位，规划出棉作区，使大部分棉田都达二、三百亩到七、八百亩。这样不仅便于田间管理，便于集中防治病虫害，更重要的是将大面积丰产田和大田连在一起，便于及时推广经验，带动大田生产。
    今年，各地在狠抓扩大棉田工作的同时，对提高棉花单位面积产量也特别重视，决心大搞植棉的技术革新工作，力争种下一亩收好一亩。为了实现这一计划，目前各植棉区都在今年植棉准备工作作得又早又好的基础上，再鼓干劲，提早进行整地、春灌、犁地、耙磨保墒等工作。气候炎热，异常缺水的吐鲁番盆地各人民公社，从半个多月前，就利用早春闲水，抓紧灌溉冬季没有灌透的棉田，结合春灌又展开了耙磨保墒活动，使这些棉田在播种前不需浇水即可开犁下种。去年获得平均亩产皮棉百斤以上的麦盖提县，最近已在准备工作基本停当的基础上，打破惯例，提前边撒肥、边犁地，这个县的七万多名维吾尔族农民，决心在播种前，把全部棉田犁好，耙平，保好墒，以便在一周内集中人力、畜力，适时播完所有棉田。今年决定扩大棉田两倍的泽普县，为了把全部棉田种好、管好，已和邻近植棉有经验的麦盖提县订了包教包学的合同，从全县一百一十四个生产队抽调了一百一十四名优秀社员派往麦盖提县学习植棉经验，麦盖提县也从各公社抽派了一百一十四名有植棉经验的社员，前往泽普县传授植棉技术。
