Inspection is for Promotion

The national zonal joint inspection of spring plowing preparation and winter crop field management organized by the Central Ministry of Agriculture is underway. Some provinces and regions are also conducting or preparing to conduct a major inspection of spring production. The purpose of these inspections is to push the spring production campaign in the vast rural areas to a new climax.

Conducting major inspections several times a year is a leadership method consistently advocated by Comrade Mao Zedong. Through major inspections, we can combine general appeals with specific leadership, combine understanding the situation with promoting work, combine summarizing experience with promoting experience, and combine political work with economic work. In this way, we can clarify the direction, improve thinking, strengthen fighting spirit, and make the broad masses and cadres full of enthusiasm and energy; we can also carry forward achievements, set examples, correct shortcomings, and solve problems, so that the broad masses and cadres can learn more effective methods. Therefore, the inspection team is also an investigation team, a visiting team, a learning team, and at the same time a propaganda team, a guidance team, and a promotion team.

Some people say: In our country, everyone is full of fighting spirit, and continuous leaps forward are taking place everywhere. Is it necessary to send so many people to various places to conduct major inspections? This statement is incorrect. This is treating inspection as a passive working method, as if inspections should only be carried out when the work is not done well. In fact, inspection is an important and regular leadership method of our party. Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us: "The basic tasks of the Communist Party's leading organs lie in two major things: understanding the situation and grasping policies. The former is what is called understanding the world, and the latter is what is called transforming the world." How to understand the situation and grasp the policies? The situation comes from the masses, and the policies are implemented through the masses; to understand the situation and grasp the policies, we must regularly and conscientiously go deep into the masses, deep into reality, investigate and study, and inspect work. Only after careful inspection can we fully understand how policies are being implemented in the work, what new creations the masses have made in the implementation of policies, and what difficulties and problems need to be solved. Inspection, of course, is to discover the advanced on the one hand, and to discover the backward on the other, but mainly to discover the advanced, promote the advanced, and promote the backward to move forward. In the inspection work, advanced units are discovered and red flags are raised high, and pacesetters are set up to quickly promote key experiences to a wider area. In areas where work is relatively backward, we must also adopt an attitude of enthusiastic help and active guidance, on the one hand, promoting the experience of advanced areas, and on the other hand, greatly promoting the positive factors of the backward areas themselves, turning backwardness into advancement. At the same time, on-site meetings can be held to help other backward units find ways to improve their work, and to encourage advanced and intermediate units to continue to advance at a faster pace. Our era is an era of great leap forward. Only by strengthening inspection can we concentrate the leap forward experiences created in various places, promote them in a timely manner, and promote overall leap forward. The Hubei Provincial Party Committee's strengthening of inspection and promotion of work is a good example. As early as the winter of 1957, the Provincial Party Committee began to use major inspections to promote water conservancy construction; in 1958, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, it decided that the Provincial Party Committee would conduct four major inspections of various major tasks throughout the year; the number of inspections by the prefectural committees, county committees, and party committees below the county level should be even greater. In the past two years, the Hubei Provincial Party Committee has organized large-scale inspections every year according to plan. Each inspection is led by the first secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and the first secretaries of the local prefectural and county committees and a large number of leading cadres participate, with great momentum. The inspection content includes industry, agriculture, finance and economics, culture, education, health, and people's lives (with different focuses in different periods). The famous national experience of Xiangyang Prefecture in vigorously developing water conservancy, the experience of Zhaogang Township in Guanghua County in establishing a watermelon seedling-style water conservancy network, and the experience of Li Dagui in diverting water to the mountains were all discovered and helped to summarize by the Hubei Provincial Party Committee inspection team. The Provincial Party Committee inspection team visited, learned, summarized, and promoted at the same time, and quickly set off a climax of water conservancy construction in the province. Last winter, the Provincial Party Committee inspection team timely summarized the experience of Yunxian County's Gao Huatang in leading the masses to control mountains, water, and soil, and the experience of Zaoyang County in transforming upland areas; bright red flags were raised high, and quickly another climax of controlling mountains, water, and soil was formed in the province. When the key issue in the water conservancy movement was to improve work efficiency, the Provincial Party Committee inspection team discovered at the Fuhu River construction site in Yunmeng County that the local area was vigorously carrying out tool reform, increasing the work efficiency of each person per day to seven cubic meters of earthwork, and immediately summarized and promoted the experience here, quickly making the work efficiency of many construction sites in the province doubled. The activities of the inspection team gave the broad masses a great encouragement, and the masses greeted the inspection team with greater enthusiasm and greater achievements; after the inspection, they improved their understanding, raised red flags, and a greater climax appeared in production and construction.

Major inspection is a concrete application of the Party's mass line, and an important method of closely combining "from the masses, to the masses." Comrade Mao Zedong said: "In all practical work of our Party, all correct leadership must be from the masses, to the masses. That is to say, the opinions of the masses (scattered and unsystematic opinions) are concentrated (after research, transformed into concentrated and systematic opinions), and then go to the masses to publicize and explain, transform them into the opinions of the masses, so that the masses persist in them, see them in action, and test whether these opinions are correct in the actions of the masses. Then concentrate from the masses again, and then persist among the masses. Such an infinite cycle is more correct, more vivid, and richer each time than the last." In any work, we must adhere to the mass line. First of all, the Party's leading cadres go deep into the masses to understand the situation, understand the opinions and requirements of the masses, and concentrate the opinions of the masses to formulate correct guidelines and policies, which is from the masses; then, mobilize the masses to implement the Party's guidelines and policies, and test and develop the Party's guidelines and policies among the masses, which is to the masses. Things are always developing and changing, and people's understanding must also continue to develop and change. In the process of the masses implementing the Party's guidelines and policies, the masses and cadres will certainly create many new things. Therefore, leaders must regularly inspect the work, conduct several major inspections a year, and timely summarize the creations and experiences of the masses to improve the level of leadership, so that the Party's guidelines and policies are more substantial and perfect, and then use them to better guide the work. Each major inspection is a process of mutual education and mutual improvement between leading cadres and the broad masses. Through major inspections, the experience of leading cadres becomes richer and their understanding becomes more correct, and the enthusiasm of the broad masses becomes higher and their methods become more numerous.

Major inspection is an important method for promoting mass movements; at the same time, it should also be a component of mass movements. Experience in various places has proved that it is necessary to combine top-down inspection with mass inspection, and to widely absorb representatives from the masses to participate. Mutual inspection between units can make the inspection work more thorough and meticulous; in the process of inspecting the work, they can learn the strengths of other units and spread the advanced experience of their own units more quickly and better. At the same time, it is also necessary to mobilize the masses in each unit to inspect the work, summarize experience, discover problems, and solve them in a timely manner. In this way, we can further improve the consciousness and initiative of the broad masses.

Inspection is to promote work and promote production; therefore, any inspection work at any time and in any scope must be closely combined with the central work and production tasks of the time and place. Some areas have adopted the following methods in inspection work: members of the inspection team must participate in production labor for a certain period of time when they arrive in each place, and the inspection team temporarily absorbs local and commune personnel to participate in the inspection work when they arrive in a place, and participate in labor in the unit being inspected during mutual inspection. This is a very good method, which can not only avoid delaying production and supporting production, but also more specifically understand the situation and more closely contact the masses; for cadres who have been separated from production for a long time, they can also receive certain labor training in the process of participating in inspection work.

Inspect several times a year, and each time we must grasp the links that are decisive for the overall situation and the whole year. The current central link in rural areas is to inspect the preparation for spring plowing and the implementation of various measures to strive for a bumper summer harvest. All localities must organize such a major inspection to push the mass movement of preparing for spring plowing and striving for a bumper summer harvest to a new climax.

### 检查是为了促进

    检查是为了促进
    中央农业部组织的全国性的春耕准备和越冬作物田间管理分区联合大检查正在进行。一些省、区，也正在进行或者准备进行春季生产大检查。这些检查的目的，就是要把广大农村的春季生产运动推向一个新的高潮。
    一年进行几次大检查，这是毛泽东同志一贯提倡的一项领导方法。通过大检查，可以把一般号召和具体领导结合起来，把了解情况和推动工作结合起来，把总结经验和推广经验结合起来，把政治工作和经济工作结合起来。这样，既能够明确方向，提高思想，加强斗志，使广大群众和干部情绪饱满，干劲十足；又能够发扬成绩，树立榜样，纠正缺点，解决问题，使广大群众和干部学习到更加有效的办法。因此，检查团也就是调查团、参观团、学习团，同时也是宣传团、辅导团、促进团。
    有人说：在我们的国家里，人人都是斗志昂扬，处处都在连续跃进，有没有必要还派很多人到各个地方大搞检查了呢？这种说法是不对的。这是把检查当成一种消极的工作方法，好像只有工作做得不好的时候，才应当进行检查。其实，检查是我们党的一个重要的、经常的领导方法。毛泽东同志指示我们：“共产党领导机关的基本任务，就在于了解情况和掌握政策两件大事，前一件事就是所谓认识世界，后一件事就是所谓改造世界。”怎样了解情况和掌握政策呢？情况是从群众中来的，政策是通过群众执行的；要了解情况，要掌握政策，就必须经常地认真地深入群众，深入实际，调查研究，检查工作。只有经过认真的检查，才能充分了解政策在工作中是怎样执行的，在执行政策中群众有些什么新的创造，有些什么困难和问题需要解决。检查当然一方面是为了发现先进，另一方面也是为了发现落后，但主要的是为了发现先进，把先进的加以推广，促进落后的向前奔。在检查工作中，发现先进单位就高插红旗，树立标兵，把关键性的经验迅速推广到广大地区。到工作比较落后的地区，也要以热情帮助、积极辅导的态度，一方面推广先进地区的经验，另一方面大大发扬落后地区本身的积极因素，变落后为先进，同时可以召开现场会议，帮助其他落后单位找到改进工作的办法，并激励先进的和中间的单位快马加鞭继续前进。我们的时代是大跃进时代，只有加强检查，才能把各地创造的跃进经验，集中起来，及时推广，促成全面跃进。中共湖北省委加强检查、推动工作就是很好的例子。这个省委早在1957年冬天就开始采用大检查的方式推动水利建设工作；1958年又根据党中央和毛泽东同志的指示，决定省委一年对各种重大工作进行四次大检查；地委、县委和县以下各级党委检查工作次数应该更多。近两年，湖北省委每年都按计划组织了大规模的检查，每次检查都由省委第一书记挂帅，各地委、县委第一书记和大批领导骨干参加，声势浩大。检查内容包括工业、农业、财经、文教卫生和群众生活等各个方面（不同的时期有不同的重点）。著名全国的襄阳专区大兴水利的经验、光化县赵冈乡建立西瓜秧式水利网的经验、李大贵引水上山的经验，都是湖北省委检查团发现和帮助总结的。省委检查团边参观、边学习、边总结、边推广，很快就在全省掀起了水利建设的高潮。去年冬天，省委检查团又及时总结了郧县高华堂领导群众治山治水治土的经验、枣阳县改造岗地的经验；鲜明的红旗高高举起，很快就又在全省形成了治山治水治土的大高潮。当着水利运动中的关键问题是提高工效的时候，省委检查团在云梦县府河工地发现当地大搞工具改革，把每人每天的工效提高到七立方米土方的先进经验，就立即把这里的经验加以总结推广，很快就使全省许多工地的工效成倍地提高。检查团的活动给广大群众以极大的鼓舞力量，群众以更大干劲更大成绩迎接检查团；检查之后，提高了认识，插起了红旗，生产建设就出现了更大的高潮。
    大检查，是党的群众路线的具体运用，是把“从群众中来”和“到群众中去”密切结合起来的一项重要方法。毛泽东同志说：“在我党的一切实际工作中，凡属正确的领导，必须是从群众中来，到群众中去。这就是说，将群众的意见（分散的无系统的意见）集中起来（经过研究，化为集中的系统的意见），又到群众中去作宣传解释，化为群众的意见，使群众坚持下去，见之于行动，并在群众行动中考验这些意见是否正确。然后再从群众中集中起来，再到群众中坚持下去。如此无限循环，一次比一次地更正确、更生动、更丰富。”在任何工作中，我们都必须坚持走群众路线。首先是党的领导干部深入群众，了解情况，了解群众意见和要求，并且集中群众的意见制定出正确的方针和政策，这就是从群众中来；然后，动员群众执行党的方针和政策，并且在群众中检验和发展党的方针和政策，这就是到群众中去。事物总是在不断发展、变化的，人的认识也必须不断发展、变化。在群众执行党的方针和政策的过程中，群众和干部一定又会创造出许多新的事物。因此，领导者必须经常地检查工作，一年进行几次大检查，及时地总结群众的创造和经验，来提高领导水平，使党的方针和政策更充实更完善，然后用以更好地指导工作。每一次大检查，都是领导干部和广大群众互相教育、互相提高的过程。通过大检查，领导干部的经验更丰富、认识更正确了，广大群众的干劲更高涨、办法也更多了。
    大检查是推进群众运动的重要方法；同时，它本身也应该是群众运动的组成部分。各地的经验都证明，必须把自上而下的检查和群众性的检查结合起来，要广泛吸收群众中的代表人物参加。各单位之间互相检查，可以使检查工作做得深入细致；他们在检查工作的过程中，可以更快更好地学习别的单位的长处和传播本单位的先进经验。同时，还要发动各单位的群众检查工作，总结经验，发现问题，及时解决。这样，就可以进一步提高广大群众的自觉性和主动性。
    检查是为了促进工作、促进生产；因此，任何时候、任何范围的检查工作，都必须同当时当地的中心工作和生产任务密切结合。有些地区在检查工作中采取了这样的办法：检查团的成员到了每个地方都要有一定的时间参加生产劳动，检查团到一个地方临时吸收地方上和公社里的人员参加检查工作，在互相检查中间，到哪个单位检查就在那个单位参加劳动。这是很好的办法，既可以不误生产、支援生产，又可以更具体地了解情况，更密切地联系群众；对长期脱离生产的干部来说，也可以在参加检查工作的过程中受到一定的劳动锻炼。
    一年检查几次，次次都要抓住对全局和全年有决定意义的环节。农村中当前的中心环节就是检查春耕准备和争取夏季大丰收的各种措施执行情况。各地都要组织这样一次大检查，把准备春耕和争取夏季大丰收的群众运动推向新的高潮。
