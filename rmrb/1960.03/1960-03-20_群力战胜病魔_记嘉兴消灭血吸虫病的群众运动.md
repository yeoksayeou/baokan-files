    Mass Strength Overcomes Disease
    ——A Record of the Mass Movement to Eliminate Schistosomiasis in Jiaxing
    By Our Reporter Tu Zhengfeng
    Jiaxing County is one of the areas in Zhejiang Province where schistosomiasis is severely prevalent. According to a general survey, the county has over 18 million square meters of snail-infested area, with the highest density reaching 1,044 snails per square meter. There are more than 380,000 schistosomiasis patients, of which farmers account for 68% of their total population, and workers account for more than 34% of their total population, seriously affecting the development of industrial and agricultural production. Since liberation, under the close concern and leadership of the Party, active prevention and control work has been carried out throughout the county, and continuous achievements have been made. Especially since the Great Leap Forward and the establishment of people's communes in 1958, prevention and control work has developed rapidly, achieving unprecedented success. According to statistics, the number of schistosomiasis patients treated in the county in 1958 was equivalent to five times the total number treated in the six years from 1952 to 1957, reaching more than 270,000. The area of land buried with snails exceeded the total area in the past six years by about three and a half times, reaching 11.58 million square meters. From last October to now, not only have all schistosomiasis patients in the county been screened and treated, but also re-screened and re-treated, and snails have been basically eliminated. Moreover, many areas have been cured of schistosomiasis, greatly improving the people's health.
    The reason why Jiaxing County's schistosomiasis prevention and control work has made accelerated progress is mainly due to the Jiaxing County Party Committee's strengthening of leadership over this work, combining it with production, and launching a mass prevention and control movement to overcome disease with mass strength.
    First Secretary Takes the Lead, Vigorously Mobilizing the Masses
    In order to strengthen leadership over the prevention and control work, the Jiaxing County Party Committee ensured that the first secretaries of Party committees at all levels, from the county to the commune, personally took charge of the prevention and control work, established prevention and control leading groups in Party committees at all levels, and greatly strengthened political and ideological education. In each period, production and prevention and control work were unified in planning, arrangement, and inspection and evaluation, ensuring the victorious development of the movement. In terms of ideological education, in addition to conducting education on the Party's health work guidelines and policies for cadres and prevention and control technicians at all levels, extensive publicity and education were carried out among the masses regarding the harm of schistosomiasis to people's health and production, as well as prevention and control methods. At the same time, people who had recovered from the disease were invited to talk about their experiences and compare their physical condition before and after treatment, explaining that only by accelerating the elimination of schistosomiasis and improving health can the shortage of labor be solved and the continuous leap forward in production be guaranteed. Through debates and detailed accounting, the masses' understanding of the consistency between eliminating schistosomiasis and developing production was enhanced. After the masses' understanding was improved, their demand for eliminating schistosomiasis became more urgent, and they put forward the slogan "better to eliminate it sooner than later," and their participation in prevention and control work became more active and enthusiastic.
    The Party Committee, Medical Personnel, and the Masses Combine
    For prevention and control personnel, in addition to general political and policy education, Party committees at all levels also combined with the development of the work to criticize the expert line of some people who were detached from production and the masses and simply exterminating snails, and mobilized technicians to teach science and technology to the masses, so that the Party committee, medical personnel, and the masses were well combined, creating favorable conditions for carrying out mass movements on a large scale. The county trained a large number of snail exterminators for each production team in the communes through various forms. They became the technical guidance force of the snail extermination shock teams of the commune production teams, and through these forces, trained more mass snail exterminators, so that the technical guidance of snail extermination could keep up with the development of the movement, ensuring the smooth development of the prevention and control movement.
    Wisdom is Concentrated, Many Methods
    After the masses were mobilized, everyone's wisdom was concentrated. Throughout the entire prevention and control movement, good methods for overcoming difficulties and solving problems were constantly created according to the different conditions of the time and place. In terms of snail extermination, various measures combining production were taken according to the different conditions of snail distribution areas. For example, combining with water conservancy construction, manure accumulation, soil improvement, and environmental sanitation to achieve both production and snail extermination; adopting methods such as combining rice field fertilization with snail extermination, as well as chemical spraying, burning, and scalding with water to eliminate snails. This not only made the snail extermination work progress quickly and with high quality, but also greatly promoted production. According to statistics from this county last year, snail extermination and sanitation manure accumulation reached more than 59 million dan. This year, from January to February, snail extermination and sanitation manure accumulation increased to more than 90 million dan.
    At the same time, after carrying out mass movements on a large scale, the work of protecting water sources and managing feces was also done well, preventing schistosomiasis eggs from entering the water. According to the principles of "three conveniences and one far" – convenience for the masses to use, convenience for feces management, convenience for production, and far from rivers and ports – Jiaxing County appropriately concentrated the county's manure tanks in small areas, shaded and covered them, and sealed them with mud for fermentation to kill insect eggs. In 1955 and 1956, due to the lack of mass movements, medical personnel conducted several pilot projects, concentrating more than 1,400 manure tanks, but the commune members, due to lack of understanding and habit, quietly moved these manure tanks back to their original locations after the medical personnel left. However, since last year, mass movements have been carried out on a large scale, and the masses have consciously concentrated the manure tanks, sealed them with mud and covered them, and carried out harmless treatment of feces. On this basis, many communes have further creatively excavated "sanitary pools" specially for washing chamber pots and manure utensils, and established fecal management personnel to ensure the cleanliness of drinking water sources.
    In terms of treatment, because prevention and control personnel throughout the county, on the basis of improving understanding, conscientiously implemented the mass line, actively improved their work style, improved their skills and methods, and received strong assistance from the masses, all difficulties were overcome smoothly. Prevention and control personnel throughout the county organized prevention and control teams, went deep into the communes, set up decentralized points, and actively carried out prevention and control work relying on the masses, which was warmly welcomed by the commune members. If there were no wards, the commune members would automatically vacate civilian houses; if there were no hospital beds, they would be replaced with door panels and tables; if there was a shortage of nursing staff, the commune would select outstanding young commune members to nurse while learning. To date, more than 4,400 rural health workers have been trained throughout the county using this method. After a short period of study, these health workers can not only independently conduct technical guidance for schistosomiasis prevention and control, but also undertake medical work during busy farming seasons, becoming a health technical team for eliminating pests and diseases in rural areas. Many rural health workers can give injections, acupuncture, see patients and prescribe medicine, as well as provide nursing, examination, and wound bandaging, which the commune members are very satisfied with.
    Masses and medical personnel cooperate. In the arrangement of treatment time, according to the production season, the patients in each treatment period were combined with production plans and arranged to people, so that patients knew about the treatment early. In terms of treatment methods, conventional methods were broken. The method of antimony agent injection every other day for a long course of twenty days was generally changed to antimony agent three-day therapy, and a fast working method of multiple points in one group, cross-operation, and combination of doctors, nurses, and inspectors was adopted. Last year, different treatment forms that met the needs of production and the requirements of the masses were further created according to different seasons and patient characteristics. For example, during the busy farming season, decentralized points were set up, and health care boxes and treatment teams were formed in the fields for production and treatment while working, and medical personnel worked with the shifts. For fishermen and boat people, water treatment teams were organized to follow the boats for production and treatment. For patients with late-stage schistosomiasis, traditional Chinese medicine and surgery were used for treatment. Because the treatment forms were closely combined with production, health work could also keep up with the continuous leap forward in production, and a new situation of high work efficiency in schistosomiasis treatment appeared. The county alone treated more than 82,000 schistosomiasis patients in September last year. Not only that, after carrying out mass movements on a large scale, folk prescriptions, secret recipes, and traditional Chinese medicine scattered among the masses were further discovered and used. In addition to the Jiaxing County Schistosomiasis Prevention and Treatment Hospital focusing on the use of traditional Chinese medicine pumpkin seeds to treat schistosomiasis patients in the acute infection period and late-stage schistosomiasis patients with acute symptoms with effective results, more than 30 kinds of folk prescriptions and folk medicines that have been verified as effective have been widely used for various symptoms of late-stage schistosomiasis patients throughout the county. Therefore, nearly 6,000 late-stage schistosomiasis patients throughout the county have received effective treatment. Because the methods of mass movement treatment are diverse, the time is short, and the curative effect is high, so the masses praised it, the cadres were satisfied, and the patients were even more satisfied.
    Technological Innovation, Fruitful Results
    After Jiaxing County carried out mass movements on a large scale in medical treatment, it not only did not weaken or reduce the strength of medical personnel, but on the contrary, greatly improved the technical level of prevention and control personnel. Because prevention and control personnel improved their political awareness and gave play to their communist style of daring to think, speak, and act, new records and new creations continued to emerge in schistosomiasis prevention and control work. Since 1958, there have been a total of more than 14,000 mass medical creations and innovations. For example, medical personnel from Xitang Commune Hospital actively studied the principle that antimony agent injection reaction is mild at night, shortened the three-day dose to two days, and created a two-day antimony agent therapy of giving injections in batches at night, improving work efficiency. On this basis, Tianren Commune Hospital cooperated with patients and further created a production therapy of producing during the day, injecting at night, and producing while treating. After these advanced therapies were promoted throughout the county, they not only solved the contradiction between treating schistosomiasis patients and production, but also greatly accelerated the speed of eliminating schistosomiasis. These mass creations, after being reviewed by the Zhejiang Provincial Schistosomiasis Research Committee based on a re-examination of more than 10,000 patients six months after treatment, and an assessment of more than 30,000 cases of schistosomiasis, proved that the patient cure rate increased from 77.9% of the original antimony agent twenty-day therapy to 89.2%, and the reaction was mild, ensuring safety, improving medical quality, and was greatly welcomed by cadres and the masses. During the large-scale treatment work, in order to solve the shortage of medical personnel, young medical personnel created a multi-point group, a three-in-one all-rounder working method for doctors, nurses, and inspectors, which greatly improved work efficiency. In order to solve the shortage of medical equipment, medical personnel made their own wooden microscope boxes, dismantling one into two for use, and made their own wooden hand-cranked precipitators, automatic liquid extractors, nocturnal miracidia observation lamps, and straw-made incubation boxes and other native machinery, solving the needs of high-speed elimination of schistosomiasis. He Tianchou, a laboratory technician from Tianren Commune Hospital who had only undergone three months of short-term training, relied on the masses to create 24 kinds of tools in one month, and a "one-stop" inspection work method of arrangement, washing, and inspection, which made the inspection work semi-mechanized, increasing from an average of 150 schistosomiasis patients inspected by one person per day to a record high of 1,620 people. Zhu Jinwen, a nurse from Xitang Commune, adopted a squatting and circling treatment method, creating a fast working method of treating 149 people per day per person.

    群力战胜病魔
    ——记嘉兴消灭血吸虫病的群众运动
    本报记者　屠正峰
    嘉兴县是浙江省血吸虫病流行严重的地区之一。据普查：全县有钉螺面积达一千八百多万平方米，钉螺密度最高的每平方米有一千零四十四只；有血吸虫病人三十八万多人，其中农民发病人数占其总人数的68％，工人占其总人数的34％以上，严重地影响着工农业生产的发展。解放以来，在党的密切关怀和领导下，即在全县范围内积极开展防治工作，不断地取得成就。特别是自1958年大跃进和人民公社化以来，防治工作有了快速发展，取得了空前的成就。据统计，全县1958年治疗血吸虫病人数相当于1952年到1957年六年中治疗人数总和的五倍，达二十七万多人；土埋钉螺面积超过以往六年总面积约三倍半，达一千一百五十八万平方米。从去年10月到现在，不但全县血吸虫病人，已全部获得普查普治，还进行了复查复治，钉螺已基本消灭，而且，使许多地区已根治了血吸虫病，大大提高了人民的健康水平。
    嘉兴县的防治血吸虫病工作，所以能获得加速进展，主要是由于中共嘉兴县委加强对这一工作的领导，结合生产，掀起了群众防治运动的热潮，以群力战胜病魔。
    第一书记挂帅　大力发动群众
    嘉兴县委为了加强对防治工作的领导，从县到公社，各级党委第一书记都亲自挂帅来抓防治工作，建立各级党委的防治领导小组，并大大加强政治思想教育。在每一时期，都把生产与防治工作进行统一计划，统一安排，并统一检查评比。保证运动的胜利开展。在思想教育方面，除去对各级干部和防治技术人员进行有关党的卫生工作方针政策等教育以外，并对广大群众广泛地进行关于血吸虫病对于人的健康和生产的危害性，以及防治方法的宣传教育，同时，邀请病愈的人讲体会和治疗前后身体情况的对比，说明只有加速消灭血吸虫病，增进健康，才能解决劳动力不足，保证生产不断跃进。还通过辩论和算细账，提高群众对于消灭血吸虫病与发展生产一致性的认识。群众提高认识以后，对消灭血吸虫病的要求更感迫切，提出了“迟消灭不如早消灭”的口号，参加防治工作也更加积极热情。
    党委、医药人员和群众三结合
    对于防治人员，各级党委除去对他们进行一般的政治和政策教育以外，还结合着工作的开展，批判了某些人脱离生产、脱离群众单纯灭螺的专家路线，发动技术人员给群众教科学技术，使党委、医药人员和群众很好的结合起来，为大搞群众运动创造了有利条件。全县通过各种形式为公社各个生产队训练了大批灭螺员，他们成了公社生产队灭螺突击队的技术指导力量，并通过这些力量，训练出更多的群众灭螺员，使灭螺的技术指导跟上运动的发展，保证防治运动的顺利开展。
    智慧集中办法多
    群众发动起来后，大家的智慧集中起来，在整个防治运动中，不断因时因地地创造出克服困难、解决问题的好办法。在灭螺方面，各地根据钉螺分布地区的不同条件，采取了多种多样结合生产的措施。如结合兴修水利、积肥、改良土壤、改善环境卫生等工作，做到生产、灭螺两有利；采用了结合稻田施肥灭螺以及化学药物喷杀、火烧、水烫等许多消灭钉螺办法。不仅使灭螺工作进展快、质量高，而且也大大地促进了生产。据这个县去年统计，灭螺卫生积肥即达五千九百多万担。今年，1月到2月份，灭螺卫生积肥更增加到九千多万担。
    同时，在大搞群众运动以后，也搞好了保护水源和粪便管理的工作，不让血吸虫卵下水。嘉兴县根据便利群众使用，便利粪便管理，便利生产和远离河港的“三便一远”的原则，将全县粪缸因地制宜地小型集中，遮荫加盖，进行泥封发酵以杀灭虫卵。这个县在1955年和1956年，由于没有搞群众运动，医务人员搞了几个试点，集中了一千四百多只粪缸，但社员们由于不了解、不习惯，这些粪缸在医务人员走后都悄悄地搬回原处去了。但自去年以来大搞了群众运动，群众自觉地把粪缸集中，并把它泥封加盖和把粪便进行无害化处理。在这一基础上，不少公社又进一步创造性地挖掘了专供马桶和粪具洗刷用的“卫生潭”，设立了粪便专管员，保证了食用水源的清洁。
    在治疗方面，由于全县防治人员在提高认识的基础上，认真贯彻群众路线，积极改进作风，提高技术和改进方法，得到群众的大力协助，就使所有困难都获得顺利克服。全县防治人员组织起防治小组，深入到社，分散设点，依靠群众积极开展防治工作，受到公社社员的热烈欢迎。没有病房，社员就自动的腾出民房；没有病床，就用门板和桌子来代替；缺乏护理人员，公社就选派优秀青年社员来边护理、边学习。到目前止，全县采取这种方法培养出来的农村保健员已有四千四百多人。这些保健员，经过短期的学习，不仅能独立进行血吸虫病防治的技术指导，而且还能担任农忙医疗工作，成了农村的一支除害灭病的卫生技术队伍。不少农村保健员能注射、针灸、看病给药，又能护理、检验、包扎外伤等，社员非常满意。
    群众和医务人员协作，在治疗病人时间的安排上，根据生产季节，把每期治疗的病人结合生产规划，安排到人，做到病人治病早知道。在治疗方法上打破常规，由锑剂二十日长程间日注射的方法，普遍地改为锑剂三日疗法，还采用了一组多点、交叉做法和医师、护理、检验三结合的快速工作法。去年又进一步根据不同的季节和病人体征情况，创造了适应生产需要和群众要求的不同治疗形式。如农忙季节，采用分片设点，和货郎担保健箱、治疗组形式在田间边生产边治疗，医务人员跟班劳动；对渔民、船民，组织水上治疗队，随船边生产边治疗；对晚期血吸虫病人采用中药与手术治疗。由于治疗形式紧密地结合生产，从而使卫生工作也能跟着生产的不断跃进，而出现了高工效的血吸虫病治疗新局面，全县仅在去年9月份一个月中，就治疗血吸虫病人八万二千多人。不仅如此，大搞群众运动以后，散传在群众中的土方、秘方和中医中药也得到了进一步的发掘和运用。嘉兴县除了血吸虫病防治医院重点的采用中药南瓜子治疗急性感染期血吸虫病人，和晚期血吸虫有急性期症状病人取得疗效外，在全县范围内对晚期血吸虫病人各期症状还普遍地采用了经过试验证实有效的民间土方、土药共有三十多种。因此，使全县近六千个晚期血吸虫病人都获得了有效的治疗，由于大搞群众运动治疗的办法种多类广，时间短，疗效高，所以群众称好，干部满意，病人更满意。
    革新技术　成果累累
    嘉兴县在医疗上大搞群众运动后，不仅没有削弱或减轻医务人员的力量，相反地使防治人员的技术水平有了很大的提高。防治人员由于提高了政治觉悟，发挥了他们敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，血吸虫病防治工作即不断出现新纪录、新创造。1958年以来，群众性的医疗创造、革新共有一万四千多件。如西塘公社医院医务人员积极钻研根据锑剂夜间注射反应轻的原理，将三日的剂量缩短为二日，创造了三日夜分批打针的锑剂二日疗法，提高了工作效率。天壬公社医院在这一基础上与病人协作，又进一步创造了白天生产、夜间注射和边生产、边治疗的生产疗法。这些先进疗法在全县推广后，不仅解决了治疗血吸虫病人与生产的矛盾，而且也大大加快了消灭血吸虫病的速度。这些群众性创造，经浙江省血吸虫病研究委员会根据一万多病人治疗六个月后的复查，和治疗三万多例血吸虫病人的鉴定证明：病人治愈率从原来锑剂二十日疗法的77．9％，提高到89．2％，而且反应轻，保证安全，也提高了医疗质量，大受干部、群众欢迎。在大规模开展治疗工作时，为了解决医务人员不足，青年医务人员就创造了一组多点，医生、护士和检验员三统一的多面手工作方法，大大地提高了工作效率。为了解决医疗机械不足，医务人员就自制木质显微镜箱，一架拆成两架用，自制木质手摇沉淀器、自动抽液器、夜间观察毛蚴灯和稻草制成孵化箱等土机械，解决了高速度消灭血吸虫病的需要。天壬公社医院只经过三个月短期训练的化验员何天仇，他依靠群众，在一个月中创造了二十四种工具，和排、洗、检“一条龙”的检验工作法，使检验工作达到半机械化，从一人一天平均检验血吸虫病人一百五十人，提高到一千六百二十人的最高纪录。西塘公社护士朱锦文采取蹲点打圈的治疗方法，创造了一人日治一百四十九人的快速工作法。
