Railway vehicle departments across the country are using the method of exchanging gifts of technological innovation and technological revolution, so that innovation in one place quickly blossoms and bears fruit everywhere. Recently, the Ministry of Railways concentrated these gifts in Zhengzhou, conducted appraisals and matching through technical performances, and finally assembled twenty-nine sets of advanced train repair mechanical tools. These mechanical tools can greatly shorten the repair time of trains, with work efficiency generally increasing by 30%-60%, and up to more than double in some cases; even changing wheels can be completed in about twenty minutes, eliminating the need to detach the vehicles and send them to the depot for repair as was previously necessary.

Train repair involves the train repair department checking and repairing any damage that occurs during train operation while the train is stopped at the station. If the repair tools are backward and inefficient, some repairs cannot be completed within the prescribed stopping time, and some damaged vehicles have to be detached and handled separately. This cannot meet the needs of the new situation of "one-dragon" transportation and large-scale collaboration across the country.

Just as railway vehicle departments across the country were launching mass movements of technological innovation and technological revolution centered on protecting the "dragon" (i.e., railway transport) and ensuring its safety, the Zhengzhou Railway Vehicle Depot took the lead in creating an advanced train repair tool in December of last year. This tool has sixteen uses, and is lightweight, flexible, and easy to carry, with very high work efficiency. At that time, the person in charge of the Vehicle Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, who was working in Zhengzhou, decided to promote this tool nationwide. However, using the past method of visiting and learning, drawing and manufacturing, would be too slow. Therefore, they asked the Zhengzhou Vehicle Depot to make more and send one to each bureau. The Zhengzhou Railway Vehicle Depot not only accepted this request, but also proposed: gifts should not be the same, but should be more innovative. As a result, five kinds of gifts were sent to various places, promoting the development of technological innovation and technological revolution movements in railway vehicle departments across the country. Soon, the Zhengzhou Vehicle Depot received thirty-one kinds of advanced tools in return from various places, which led the technological innovation and technological revolution movement of the Zhengzhou Vehicle Depot to a new climax.

Recently, the Ministry of Railways concentrated the gifts of technological innovation and technological revolution that railway vehicle departments across the country had already exchanged and were preparing to exchange in Zhengzhou, totaling more than fifty kinds and more than four hundred pieces. These advanced car repair mechanical tools are all new products that did not exist in the past and cannot be found in books. While sending these products, various places also sent a group of skilled car repairers to Zhengzhou for technical demonstrations. Through one hundred and fifty technical demonstrations, not only was the power of these new tools displayed, and usage techniques were exchanged with each other, but also these tools were compared, appraised, and finally assembled into sets by taking the best from each.

The Ministry of Railways organized railway vehicle departments across the country to combine sending gifts of technological innovation with centralized demonstrations, quickly leading the entire industry's technological innovation and technological revolution movement, centered on protecting the "dragon" and ensuring its safety, towards serialization and complete sets. At present, on this basis, various places are using both indigenous and foreign methods to vigorously develop car repair automatic lines, linked lines, and assembly lines, marching towards the mechanization, automation, and electrification of car repair.

### 铁路车辆部门互送革新礼品  铁道部已把这些礼品配成二十九套先进检修机具

    铁路车辆部门互送革新礼品
    铁道部已把这些礼品配成二十九套先进检修机具
    本报讯　全国各地铁路车辆部门以互送技术革新和技术革命礼品的方法，使一处革新，很快就到处开花结果。最近，铁道部把这些礼品集中在郑州，通过技术表演，进行了鉴定、配套，最后配成二十九套先进的列车检修机械工具。这些机械工具可以大大缩短列车的检修时间，工作效率普遍提高30％—60％，最高达到一倍以上；就连换车轮也能在二十分钟左右的时间内换完，不必再像以前那样把车辆摘下，入库修理。
    列车检修，就是列车开到站后，由列车检修部门在站上把列车运行中发生损坏的地方，检查出来，修好。如果检修工具落后，效率不高，有的就不能在规定的停车时间内检修完毕，有的还要把受损的车辆摘下另行处理。这就不能适应全国“一条龙”运输大协作新形势的需要。
    正当各地铁路车辆部门以护龙、保龙为中心，发动群众开展技术革新和技术革命运动的时候，郑州铁路车辆段在去年12月间，首先创造了一种先进的列车检修工具，这种工具有十六种用途，并且轻便灵巧，携带方便，工作效率很高。当时在郑州工作的铁道部车辆局负责人，就决定将这一工具向全国推广。可是，再用过去参观学习、绘图制作的办法推广，就太慢了，因此，让郑州车辆段多做一些，给各局送一个。郑州铁路车辆段不但接受了这一要求，并且提出：送礼不能送一样，要多创造几种。结果向各地送了五种礼品，促进了各地铁路车辆部门的技术革新和技术革命运动的开展。很快郑州车辆段就收到各地回赠的先进工具三十一种，又把郑州车辆段的技术革新和技术革命运动引向新的高潮。
    最近，铁道部把各地铁路车辆部门已经互相赠送的和正在准备赠送的技术革新和技术革命的礼品，在郑州集中起来，共有五十多种、四百多件。这些先进的修车机械工具，都是过去没有的和书本上找不到的新产品。各地在送这些产品的同时，还派来一批修车能手，在郑州进行了技术表演。通过一百五十项技术表演，不仅显示了这些新工具的威力，互相传授了使用技术，并且对这些工具进行了评比、鉴定，最后以取长补短的办法，配成了套。
    铁道部组织各地铁路车辆部门以送技术革新礼品和集中表演相结合的办法，把全行业的以护龙保龙为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动，迅速引向成套化、系列化。目前，各地正在这个基础上，以土洋并举的办法，大搞修车自动线、联动线、流水线，向修车机械化、自动化、电气化进军。
