Helping Others is a Pleasure

For the Advancement of Everyone
Zhang Xiuyun, a female fine yarn worker at the Liaoyang City Hemp Bag Factory, has helped fifteen comrades go from being backward to advanced over the past few years. Here is just one story about her helping her apprentice, Hong Sumei:

Hong Sumei was originally a laboratory tester, and had been working in the fine yarn workshop for less than six months. In September of last year, the workers in the fine yarn workshop, in order to overfulfill their production tasks, each watched two machines. Hong Sumei was a novice, and her two machines often experienced "yarn breakage," causing her worry all day long.

One evening, Hong Sumei's machine broke again. On the long machine surface, it was as if a knife had been drawn across it, with fewer than ten of the more than two hundred yarn ends remaining. Before the broken ends on the east side could be rejoined, the joints on the west side broke again... Hong Sumei was sweating profusely with the effort. At this difficult moment, Zhang Xiuyun came to Hong Sumei's side.

While helping Hong Sumei, Zhang Xiuyun also had to run back to check on her own machines. Running back and forth like this, her clothes were soaked in sweat. Hong Sumei was so moved that she felt bad, and said to Zhang Xiuyun, "Sister Zhang, don't worry about me. I'll pick myself up. What if it affects your being named an advanced producer?" Zhang Xiuyun smiled and said to Hong Sumei, "It doesn't matter, we're not working to be named advanced producers. Little Hong, think about it, even if I'm the only one advanced, I can only produce five or sixty more pounds of yarn a day at most. You can't build socialism by killing yourself. If everyone is advanced, the hemp bags we produce can be piled into stacks. Which way do you think is more beneficial to the Party?" These words filled Hong Sumei with strength.

In order to help Hong Sumei improve her skills as quickly as possible, Zhang Xiuyun formally formed a mutual aid group with her. Zhang Xiuyun taught her her thirteen years of experience step by step. Hong Sumei improved rapidly, and is now able to operate two machines, and her production efficiency has increased from 69% in October to over 86%. She has been named an advanced producer for three consecutive months.

一心为别人着想 (Wholeheartedly Thinking of Others)

冯兰花 (Feng Lanhua), a postman at the Yuchi City Post and Telecommunications Bureau in Shanxi Province, has a sincere heart for serving the masses. If she knows that a recipient is sick, she personally delivers the letter to their bedside. If the recipient's name or address is unclear, she asks around everywhere, not giving up until she finds them. She says, "Even if it's just a regular letter, there might be something important inside!" Once, she received a letter addressed to "Chang Bao, No. 8 Dongdi Street." Lanhua delivered it to No. 8 Dongdi Street, but there was no one by that name. Two days later, she went to Dongdi Street to inquire again, but still no one. On the third day, she went to the residents' committee to ask, but they couldn't find anyone either. At this time, someone said, "You've been running around for three days and there's no such person. Just return it!" Lanhua said, "No, it's not going out of Yuchi City anyway." After that, she asked everyone she met and inquired at every household. On the tenth day, she finally found the person on Miaodi Street. In half a year, she managed to deliver more than 360 pieces of similar "illegible mail." Lanhua cares about the masses, and the masses also care for Lanhua. In recent years, she has been continuously elected as an advanced producer of the bureau, city, and province, winning twenty certificates of merit, ten medals, and attending the National Congress of Heroes.

孩子的“妈妈” (The Children's "Mama")

任素英 (Ren Suying) works as a nursery worker in the Guanyinsi Street Kindergarten in Beixinqiao, Beijing. Parents say, "There's no child she can't teach well." The children also treat her as their "mama" and can't do without her.

When she first started working as a nursery worker, Ren Suying only attended a nursery training class for a month and a half, and there were many difficulties. She thought, "This won't do! Mothers entrust their children to us, and we must not only raise them well, but also educate them well. Otherwise, it will affect their future participation in socialist and communist construction." Thinking of this, she was determined to first learn culture. Regardless of late nights or noons, regardless of hot summers or cold winters, she persevered in her studies and finally reached a junior high school level of education.

Ren Suying also diligently studied her profession. She often closed her door late at night to learn to dance, practicing until her posture was skilled and correct, before teaching it to the children.

Under the teachings of the Party, Ren Suying realized that to build socialism and communism, one must first pay attention to cultivating communist morality in children. She conducted detailed analyses of the more mischievous children, and came up with many ways to cultivate their new virtues. She discovered that one child in the class didn't like to play with everyone. When the children were building blocks, Ren Suying encouraged him by saying, "Look, how many people does it take to build this building! So many workers are still too busy, we are missing someone to move bricks, hurry up and help!" This child happily went to play with everyone. 铁峰插图 (Illustration by Tie Feng)

对敌斗争的女将 (Female Warriors in the Struggle Against the Enemy)

On the Fujian front, female militia members with guns and ammunition can be seen everywhere. Together with the male militia members, they cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to monitor the enemy at sea, protect the production labor of farmers and fishermen, and maintain social order in urban and rural islands.

The well-known female heroes on the front lines, Hong Xiucong, Zhang Jiucai, Lin Shuixian, Cai Men, Chen Shuquan, etc., are a group of female warriors in the struggle against the enemy. Some are the heads, battalion commanders, or company commanders of the militia regiment, some are excellent female shooters, and some have won banners as "heroic female artillerymen" in battles punishing the enemy. During one artillery battle, female militia members Chen Shuquan and Wu Qiuhong of Weitou were delivering water to the front lines. On the way, the water bucket was pierced by a shell fired by the enemy, and boiling water scalded their legs and feet. Disregarding their own burns, they immediately tore off pieces of their floral clothing to plug the hole in the water bucket, and delivered the boiling water to the front lines on time.

钮扣 (Buttons)

Recently, an interesting incident was found in the opinion book of a train car served by the women's package crew of the Shanghai Railway Bureau's Train Section:

In December of last year, a naval lieutenant lost two buttons from his military uniform after boarding the train from Beijing. A military uniform without buttons is a breach of military discipline, but no one thought to bring needle and thread with them when traveling. After discovering this situation, the train attendant, Zhang Guizhen, took the initiative to run through several train cars, borrowed a needle and a ball of white thread, and then used ink to dye the white thread blue, sewing two buttons onto the naval lieutenant's uniform. When the naval lieutenant got off the train, he wrote in the passenger opinion book: "I am an ordinary naval officer on the Fujian front lines. Whenever I wear this coat and touch these two buttons, I will think of you, and think of the thousands upon thousands of women who are engaged in ordinary labor in all parts of the motherland. Thinking of this will increase our confidence and strength in defending the sacred territorial waters of the motherland and in liberating Taiwan."

    助人为乐
    为了大家先进
    辽阳市麻袋厂细纱女工张秀云，她几年来先后帮助了十五个同志由后进变成先进。这里只说他帮助徒工洪素梅的一段：
    洪素梅原来是试验室里的试验员，到细纱车间做工不到六个月。去年9月，细纱车间的工人们为了超额完成生产任务，人人都看两个机台。洪素梅是新手，她的两个机台时常发生“断头”的现象，整天愁得没办法。
    一天晚上，洪素梅的机台又“断头”了。长长的机台面上，像被划过一刀，二百多个纱头剩下的不到十个，东边的断头还没接好，西边的接头又断下来……，洪素梅忙得满头大汗。正在困难的时刻，张秀云来到洪素梅面前。
    张秀云一面帮助洪素梅，一面还要跑回去看自己的机台。这样，她两头跑，身上的汗像水洗一般。洪素梅感动得过意不去，就对张秀云说：“张姐，不要管我了。我自己栽倒自己爬吧。影响你评先进生产者怎么办？”张秀云却笑着对洪素梅说：“不要紧，咱们劳动不是为了评先进生产者。小洪，你核计核计，光姐一个人先进，一天最多也不过多出五、六十斤纱，累死也建不成社会主义。大伙都先进，增产的麻袋就能堆成垛，你说怎么干对党有利？”这些话使洪素梅感到全身都充满了力量。
    为了尽快地帮助洪素梅提高技术，张秀云和她正式成立了一个互助组。张秀云手把手把她入厂十三年的经验交给她。洪素梅进步飞快，现在已经能够掌握双台机器，生产效率也由10月份的69％提高到86％以上，并且一连三个月都被评上了先进生产者。
    一心为别人着想
    山西省榆次市邮电局的邮递员冯兰花有一颗真挚的为群众服务的心。她如果知道收件人有病，就亲自把信送到床前，遇到收件姓名、地址不清，她就四处询问，找不到不罢休。她说：“别看是封平信，说不定里面有什么重要事哩！”有次收到一封写着：“东地街八号常保收”的信。兰花送到东地街八号却没这人，等两天又到东地街询问，还没有，第三天到居民委员会去问，也没查出来。这时，有人说：“你跑了三天没这个人，还是退了吧！”兰花说：“不，反正出不了榆次市。”以后，她逢人就问，挨户打听，第十天，终于在苗地街找到了这个人，类似这样的“瞎信”，半年的时间，她就设法投送了三百六十多件。兰花关心群众，群众也爱护兰花。这几年，她连续当选为局、市、省的先进生产者，荣获二十个奖状，十枚奖章，出席了全国群英会。

    孩子的“妈妈”
    任素英在北京市北新桥观音寺街道幼儿园担任保育员。家长们说：“没有她教不好的孩子。”孩子们也把她当成自己的“妈妈”，离不开她。
    刚参加保育工作时，任素英只去保育训练班学习了一个半月，困难是不少的。她想：“这怎么行呀！妈妈把孩子交给我们，不但要养好，还要教育好。否则就会影响他们将来参加社会主义和共产主义建设。”想到这些，她就下定决心首先学文化，不管深夜或是中午，不管炎夏还是寒冬，她坚持苦学，终于达到了初中文化水平。
    任素英同时还刻苦钻研业务。她常常在深夜关上房门学习跳舞，一直到姿势熟练、正确，才去教给孩子。
    在党的教导下，任素英体会到建设社会主义和共产主义，就首先要注意培养儿童共产主义的品德。她对比较调皮的儿童，进行细致分析，想出很多办法培养他们的新品德。她发现班上有一个小朋友不爱和大家一块玩。小朋友们在搭积木时，任素英就启发他说：“你看，这座楼房要多少人才盖得起来呀！这么多工人还忙不过来，缺一个搬砖的，快去帮忙吧！”这个小朋友便高高兴兴地和大家一起玩了。铁

    对敌斗争的女将
    在福建前线，到处都有持枪披弹的女民兵，她们和男民兵一道配合人民解放军监视着海上的敌人，保卫着农民和渔民的生产劳动，维持着城乡岛屿的社会治安。
    前线闻名的女英雄洪秀枞、张韭菜、林水仙、蔡闷、陈淑泉等，就是一批对敌斗争的女将。她们有的是民兵团的团长、营长或连长，有的是优秀的女射击手，有的是在惩罚敌人的战斗中荣获锦旗的“英雄女炮手”。围头女民兵陈淑泉、吴秋红在一次炮战时，往阵地上送水，半路上水桶被敌人射来的炮弹打了个洞，开水烫伤了她们两人的腿脚，但她们不顾自己的烫伤，马上将身上的花衣服撕下一块，堵住水桶的漏洞，把开水按时送上了阵地。
   钮扣
    最近在上海铁路局列车段妇女包乘组服务的列车车厢意见簿上，发现有这样一个有趣的事：
    去年12月，有一位海军中尉从北京上车后挤掉了军服上的两颗钮扣。军服没有扣子，这是军风纪不整，可是谁也没有想到出门随身带着针线。列车员张规珍发现这个情况后，就主动地跑了几节车厢，借来一根针和一团白线，然后用墨水把白线染成蓝色，替这位海军中尉缝上了两颗扣子。海军中尉下车的时候，在旅客意见簿上写道：“我是福建前线的一个普通的海军军官。每当穿着这件上衣，摸着这两颗钮扣，就会想起你们，想起在祖国各地进行着平凡劳动的千千万万个妇女们。想到这些，就会增加我们保卫祖国神圣领海、一定要解放台湾的信心和力量”。
