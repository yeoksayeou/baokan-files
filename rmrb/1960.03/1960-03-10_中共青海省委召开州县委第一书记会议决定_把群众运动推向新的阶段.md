The Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a meeting of first secretaries of prefectural and county Party committees. The meeting analyzed the current political and economic situation in Qinghai Province, summarized the rich experience of launching mass movements since 1958, discussed the national economic plan for 1960, and specifically arranged various spring tasks centered on preventing and combating drought, making a concentrated effort on spring plowing, and seizing moisture for early sowing. It demanded that Party committees at all levels continue to take socialist education as the key link, muster greater revolutionary drive, and push the mass movement to a deeper and more meticulous new stage to achieve the continued comprehensive leap forward in industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production and various construction undertakings this year.

The meeting convened by the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the CPC was held from February 5th to 15th. The meeting believed that the current political and economic situation in Qinghai Province is extremely good. On the basis of the continuous two-year Great Leap Forward in 1958 and 1959, since the beginning of this year, industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production and various construction undertakings have achieved greater results than in the same period last year, showing an unprecedentedly good new leap forward situation. On the agricultural front, more than 3.83 million mu of wasteland has been reclaimed since last winter and this spring, equivalent to half of the planting area in 1959; the irrigated area has been expanded by more than 2 million mu, equivalent to the total area of the original irrigated land; the preparations for spring plowing have also been better, faster, and more meticulous than in any previous year. The province has accumulated more than 140 billion jin of organic fertilizer and 3.1 billion jin of native chemical fertilizer, averaging more than 13,000 jin of organic fertilizer and more than 200 jin of native chemical fertilizer per mu. On the animal husbandry front, since last winter and this spring, livestock have generally been fat and strong, with high lambing rates and high survival rates. The lamb survival rate reached more than 91%, and a large number of high-yield livestock groups have emerged. Animal husbandry production has entered a new stage of high-speed development. On the industrial front, the total industrial output value in January exceeded the state plan by 15%, an increase of 145% over the same period last year, winning a "good start" and completely breaking the "routine" of being lax at the beginning of the year and the beginning of the quarter in the past. Great achievements have also been made in various fronts such as culture, education, health, finance, trade, and political and legal affairs.

After analyzing the current situation in Qinghai Province, the meeting pointed out that the primary task of Qinghai Province in 1960 is to vigorously develop agricultural production and greatly increase grain production. In response to the scarce rainfall and snowfall last winter and this spring, and the drought that has already appeared in some areas, the meeting called on all localities to immediately mobilize the whole Party and the whole people to launch a large-scale mass movement to prevent and combat drought, make a concentrated effort on spring plowing, and seize moisture for sowing, to ensure that new and old cultivated land is sown in time, to achieve full and strong seedlings, and to ensure a bumper harvest in agriculture this year. On the animal husbandry production front, pastoral areas should vigorously do a good job in the current lambing and rearing work, striving to have every lamb born, live, and grow strong, and create more high-yield livestock groups. In industry, steel should be taken as the key link to vigorously grasp iron and steel, raw coal, coke, transportation, machinery manufacturing, and capital construction, to achieve daily red, monthly red, and red to the end, and to comprehensively and evenly complete the annual plan.

In order to ensure the completion of the above tasks and achieve the continued comprehensive leap forward in various production and construction undertakings this year, the meeting focused on discussing and summarizing the rich experience of the mass movement in the past two years, pointing out that strengthening Party leadership, adhering to putting politics in command, and vigorously launching mass movements are our Party's consistent and unwavering fundamental line, and also the fundamental guarantee for achieving victory in all work. The meeting demanded that all localities continue to take socialist education as the key link, vigorously grasp mass work, vigorously strengthen the leadership on the front line, and at the same time, widely establish models, plant red flags in a big way, vigorously carry out socialist emulation movements and communist collaboration of "comparing, learning, catching up, and helping," and take technical innovation and technical revolution as the central content of the mass movement, pushing the mass movement to a deeper and more meticulous new stage.

At present, the call of this meeting convened by the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the CPC has become the actual action of Party organizations at all levels and the broad masses of the people in Qinghai Province. According to incomplete statistics, more than 6,000 cadres have been transferred from organs above the county level throughout the province to the grassroots to strengthen leadership on the front line. A new situation of surging waves and galloping horses has appeared in the mass movements on various fronts. Spring plowing is progressing quickly and well. Including winter sowing, more than 1.3 million mu of early crops have been sown throughout the province. In terms of animal husbandry production, according to statistics from late February, more than 1.5 million lambs have been born throughout the province. In terms of industrial production, the province has exceeded the industrial total output value plan for February by 9.4%.

    中共青海省委召开州县委第一书记会议决定
    把群众运动推向新的阶段
    本报讯　中共青海省委最近召开了州、县委第一书记会议，对青海省当前的政治、经济形势进行了分析，总结了1958年以来大搞群众运动的丰富经验，讨论了1960年的国民经济计划，具体布置了以防旱抗旱、突击春耕、抢墒早播为中心的春季各项工作；要求各级党委继续以社会主义教育为纲，鼓足更大革命干劲，把群众运动推向更深入、更细致的新阶段，实现今年工农牧业生产和各项建设事业的继续全面跃进。
    中共青海省委召开的这一会议是在2月5日到15日举行的。会议认为，青海省当前政治、经济形势极为良好。在1958年、1959年连续两年大跃进的基础上，今年以来，工农牧业生产和各项建设事业都取得了比去年同期更大的成绩，出现了一个空前良好的新的跃进局面。农业战线，去冬今春已开荒三百八十三万多亩，等于1959年播种面积的一半；扩大灌溉面积二百多万亩，等于原有水地面积的总和；春耕准备也比以往任何一年都抓得好、抓得快、抓得细，全省已经积造有机肥料一千四百多亿斤，土化肥三十一亿斤，平均每亩可施有机肥料一万三千多斤，土化肥二百多斤。畜牧业战线，去冬今春以来，牲畜普遍膘肥体壮，产羔多，成活多，羊羔成活率达91％以上，出现了大量的高产畜群，畜牧业生产已进入了一个高速度发展的新阶段。工业战线，1月份工业总产值共超额15％完成了国家计划，较去年同期增长了145％，夺得了“开门红”，彻底打破了过去年初、季初松的“常规”。文教卫生、财贸、政法等各个战线，也都作出了很大的成绩。
    会议在分析了青海省当前形势以后指出：青海省1960年的首要任务，是大力发展农业生产，大量增产粮食。针对去冬今春雨雪稀少，部分地区已经呈现旱象的情况，会议号召各地要全党全民立即动员起来，开展一个大规模的防旱抗旱、突击春耕、抢墒播种的群众运动，保证新老耕地及时下种，做到苗全苗旺，确保今年农业大丰收。畜牧业生产战线上，牧业区要大力作好当前的接羔育幼工作，争取生一个，活一个，壮一个，创造更多的高产畜群。工业方面，要以钢为纲大抓钢铁、原煤、焦炭、交通运输、机械制造和基本建设，实现日日红、月月红、红到底，全面均衡地完成全年计划。
    为了确保上述任务的完成，实现今年各项生产和建设事业的继续全面跃进，会议着重讨论和总结了两年来群众运动的丰富经验，指出加强党的领导，坚持政治挂帅，大搞群众运动是我们党的一贯的、坚定不移的根本路线，也是一切工作取得胜利的根本保证。会议要求各地要继续以社会主义教育为纲，大抓狠抓群众工作，大力加强第一线的领导，同时要广树标兵，大插红旗，大力开展“比、学、赶、帮”的社会主义竞赛运动和共产主义协作，并把技术革新和技术革命作为群众运动的中心内容，将群众运动推向一个更深入、更细致的新阶段。
    目前，中共青海省委召开的这一会议的号召已经成为青海省各级党的组织和广大群众的实际行动。据不完全统计，全省县级以上机关为了加强对第一线的领导，抽调到基层去的干部就有六千多人。各个战线上的群众运动都出现了波涛澎湃、万马奔腾的新局面。春耕生产进行得又快又好，连同冬播，全省已播种了早田作物一百三十多万亩。畜牧业生产方面，据2月下旬的统计，全省已产羔一百五十多万只。工业生产方面，全省已超额9．4％完成了2月份的工业总产值计划。
