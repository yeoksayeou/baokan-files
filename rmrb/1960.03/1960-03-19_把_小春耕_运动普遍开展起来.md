    Universally Launch the "Small Spring Cultivation" Movement

    The Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Party committees at all levels are mobilizing the broad masses to prepare for a "small spring cultivation" movement centered on sowing and planting wild plants.

    Everyone must remember that last autumn, in vast areas of our country, millions of people went to high mountains and into the wilderness to engage in "small autumn harvest" on a large scale, achieving a great harvest of wild plants. Taking Guizhou Province as an example, the total value of various wild industrial raw materials purchased by commercial departments in the "small autumn harvest" reached 380 million yuan, with an average increase in income of 26 yuan per commune member; among them, the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture had an average increase in income of 44 yuan per person; Jianhe County, located in a high and cold mountainous area, had an average increase in income of 226 yuan per person. The province collected 500 million jin of *Quercus variabilis* alone; calculated at 50 jin of wine per 100 jin of *Quercus variabilis*, it can produce more than 200 million jin of wine, saving several hundred million jin of grain; more than 1 million dan of wild fiber was collected, which can be used to manufacture more than 500,000 dan of artificial cotton; about 400,000 dan of wild oilseeds were collected, which can produce about 4 million jin of oil. The victory of the "small autumn harvest" is another proof of the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes, and a major achievement of the people's communes in implementing the Party's agricultural production policy of "taking grain as the key link and developing diversified undertakings in an all-round way." This victory has further promoted the consolidation and development of the communes. First of all, it directly promoted the great development of commune-run industries. Thousands of small-scale starch factories, tannin extract factories, artificial fiber factories, oil pressing factories, aromatic oil factories, and native paper mills, combining indigenous and foreign methods, were rapidly established in many regions. In order to transport the preliminarily processed raw materials and the raw materials that must be transported to the cities for processing in a timely manner, a mass-scale short-distance transportation movement was launched in various places, forming a short-distance transportation network, building and repairing vehicles and ships on a large scale, which also promoted a great development of local transportation in vast areas. Ropes, baskets, and other items made from processed wild plants supported the water conservancy movement last winter and this spring. The wild feed collected and the by-products of processing wild oilseeds and starch raw materials also played a significant role in carrying out the pig raising and manure accumulation movement. In short, the "small autumn harvest" movement is not only extremely beneficial to the development of the collective economy of the people's communes and the increase of commune members' income, but also provides industry production and export trade with a larger quantity and a greater variety of raw materials and commodities.

    In order to strive for a greater harvest in this year's "small autumn harvest," a large-scale "small spring cultivation" movement must now be launched. There are a very large number of useful wild plant species in our country, with several thousand already discovered, of which more than one thousand have higher economic value. These plants mostly have strong vitality and can grow well even under very poor natural conditions. This is indeed an inexhaustible treasure house. However, if only large-scale collection is carried out every year, without early protection, cultivation, and propagation, the yield of wild plants may gradually decrease. Conversely, if protection, cultivation, and propagation are carried out year after year, its yield can be continuously increased and its quality can be continuously improved. The people's communes should regard the utilization and transformation of wild plants as an important aspect of our march towards nature. We must rely on the people's communes to cultivate wild plants more and better. The State Council's instructions in October last year on fully mobilizing the masses to extensively collect and fully utilize wild plant raw materials put forward such a call: "For those wild plants that have greater economic value, large demand, and insufficient production, artificial cultivation should also be promoted under possible conditions to improve variety and quality, and to transform wild plants into domesticated plants, so as to develop production and guarantee needs." There is originally no absolutely insurmountable boundary between the two concepts of "wild" and "domesticated"; all domesticated plants are cultivated from wild plants. The variety improvement of domesticated plants often requires hybridization with wild plants, utilizing certain excellent properties of wild plants. Certain undesirable properties of wild plants can also be changed through artificial cultivation. Comrade Mao Zedong said in an editor's note in the book "Socialist Upsurge in the Chinese Countryside": "Socialism not only liberates the laborers and the means of production from the old society, but also liberates the vast nature that the old society could not utilize. The people have unlimited creativity. They can organize themselves and march towards all places and departments where they can exert their strength, march towards the depth and breadth of production, and create ever-increasing welfare undertakings for themselves." Now we are engaging in "small spring cultivation" on a large scale, cultivating wild plants in large quantities, which is a march towards the breadth of nature. In this march, we must also pay attention to depth, and deeply study the growth laws of wild plants in order to improve the yield and quality of wild plants and existing domesticated plants. In short, we must guide the enthusiasm of the broad commune members of the people's communes to a broader and more far-reaching new world, to tame and control more wild plants and animals, so that they can serve the cause of socialist construction.

    Wild plants can grow all over the mountains and fields, with a very wide planting area. The "small spring cultivation" centered on sowing and planting wild plants is a mass movement on a very large scale. Therefore, it is necessary to implement political command, under the unified leadership of the county Party committees and commune Party committees, to regard the "small spring cultivation" as an important part of the entire spring production, and mobilize the broad masses to consciously and actively participate. The people's communes should make an overall plan for "small spring cultivation," distinguishing between priorities and urgencies, and developing the new world of wild plants in a planned and step-by-step manner. For those that only require sowing seeds in a certain season, cultivation and management, and do not require much labor but can increase and improve the yield and quality, we must seize the opportunity at present and universally mobilize the masses to do them first. In the overall plan, the spring cultivation of large fields should be comprehensively arranged in close combination with "small spring cultivation," afforestation, forest protection, forest cultivation, soil and water conservation, etc. In order to carry out the "small spring cultivation" movement on a large scale, the forces of agriculture, forestry, commerce, light industry, scientific research and other departments and schools must also be organized to solve problems such as seed and seedling supply, technology, and labor. After planting, the responsibilities for regular management and protection must also be determined. The leadership must truly regard it as an important component of the continued leap forward in the entire agricultural production, and regularly inspect and assist to ensure the great victory of the "small spring cultivation" and bring about a great harvest of the "small autumn harvest."

### 把“小春耕”运动普遍开展起来

    把“小春耕”运动普遍开展起来
    中共辽宁省委和各级党委正在发动广大群众，准备开展一个以播种和栽植野生植物为中心的“小春耕”运动。
    大家一定还记得，去年秋天，在我国的广大地区，千百万人上高山、入荒野，大搞“小秋收”，取得野生植物的大丰收。以贵州省为例，全省在“小秋收”中由商业部门收购起来的各种野生的工业原料，总值达三亿八千多万元，全省平均每个社员可增加收入二十六元；其中黔东南苗族侗族自治州，全州平均每人增加收入四十四元；地处高寒山区的剑河县，全县平均每人增加收入二百二十六元。全省只是采集的青杠子就有五亿斤；按每百斤青杠子出酒五十斤计算，可以产酒二亿多斤，能节约粮食几亿斤；采集野生纤维一百多万担，可以制造人造棉五十多万担；采集野生油料约四十万担，可以出油四百万斤左右。“小秋收”的胜利，是人民公社无比优越性的又一证明，是人民公社执行党的“以粮为纲，全面发展多种经营”的农业生产方针的重大成就。这个胜利同时更进一步促进了公社的巩固和发展。首先是直接促进了社办工业的大发展，成千成万土洋结合的小型的淀粉厂、栲胶厂、人造纤维厂、榨油厂、芳香油厂、土纸厂等等，在很多地区迅速兴办起来。为了把初步加工的原料和必须运到城市去加工的原料及时运输出去，各地都开展了群众性的大规模短途运输运动，组成了短途运输网，大修大造车船，促使广大地区的地方交通事业也有了一个大发展。用野生植物加工制成的绳索、筐篓等等，支援了去冬今春的水利运动。采集的野生饲料和野生油料、淀粉原料加工后的副产品，在开展养猪积肥运动中也起了很大的作用。总之，“小秋收”运动不仅对于发展人民公社的集体经济和增加社员收入极为有利，同时也为工业生产和出口贸易提供了数量更大、品种更多的原料和商品。
    为了争取今年“小秋收”更大的丰收，现在就要开展一个大规模的“小春耕”运动。我国有用的野生植物种类非常繁多，已经发现的就有好几千种，其中经济价值较高的有一千多种。这些植物大都有很强的生命力，在很不好的自然条件下也能很好地生长。这的确是一个取之不尽的宝库。但是，如果每年只是大规模地采集，不及早加以保护、培育、繁殖，野生植物的产量有可能逐渐减少。反之，如果年年加以保护、培育和繁殖，它的产量就可以不断增加，质量也可以不断提高。人民公社应该把利用野生植物、改造野生植物作为我们向大自然进军的一个重要方面。我们要依靠人民公社更多更好地培育野生植物。去年10月国务院关于充分发动群众广泛采集和充分利用野生植物原料的指示中就提出了这样的号召：“对于那些经济价值较大、需要量大、而生产不足的野生植物，还要在可能条件下提倡人工培育，改进品种质量，变野生为家生，以发展生产，保证需要。”“野生”和“家生”这两个概念之间，本来并没有绝对不可逾越的界限；一切家生植物都由野生植物培育成的。家生植物的品种改良，往往要同野生植物杂交，利用野生植物的某些优良的性能。野生植物的某些不良的性能，经过人工的培育也可以改变。毛泽东同志在“中国农村的社会主义高潮”一书的一则按语中说：“社会主义不仅从旧社会解放了劳动者和生产资料，也解放了旧社会所无法利用的广大的自然界。人民群众有无限的创造力。他们可以组织起来，向一切可以发挥自己力量的地方和部门进军，向生产的深度和广度进军，替自己创造日益增多的福利事业。”现在我们大搞“小春耕”，大量培育野生植物，是向大自然的广度进军。在这个进军中还要注意深度，要深入地研究野生植物的生长规律，用以提高野生植物和现有的家生植物的产量和质量。总之，要把人民公社广大社员的积极性引向更广阔、更深远的新天地，驯服和驾驭更多的野生的植物、动物，使它们为社会主义建设事业服务。
    野生植物满山遍野都能生长，种植面积很广。以播种和栽植野生植物为中心的“小春耕”，是一个规模很大的群众运动。因此，一定要实行政治挂帅，由县委和公社党委统一领导，把“小春耕”作为整个春季生产的一个重要部分，动员广大群众自觉地积极地参加。人民公社应当作出“小春耕”的通盘规划，分别轻重缓急，有计划有步骤地开拓野生植物的新天地。对于那些只要在一定的季节播下种籽，加以培植管理，用工不多而产量和质量就可以增加和提高的，目前就要抓紧时机，普遍地发动群众先来做。在全面规划中，要把大田春耕和“小春耕”以至造林护林育林、水土保持等等，全面安排，使之密切结合。为了大规模地开展“小春耕”运动，还要把农业、林业、商业、轻工业、科学研究等部门和学校的力量都组织起来，解决种苗供应、技术、劳力等问题。种植之后，还要确定经常管理和保护的责任。领导方面要确实把它当作整个农业生产继续跃进的重要组成部分，经常检查和帮助，确保“小春耕”的大胜利，带来“小秋收”的大丰收。
