Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, March 3rd. The overseas Chinese who returned from Indonesia on the 29th are deeply grateful for the care and love shown to them by the motherland. They said that the motherland's kindness is higher than the sky and deeper than the sea.

The overseas Chinese who suffered greatly in Indonesia said that their ability to return to the happy motherland is the result of the strong motherland's care and love. The overseas Chinese who returned from Sukabumi said that they yearned for the motherland's socialist construction, and many requested to return home, but were met with many obstacles. When they learned from the radio and newspapers that the motherland had sent ships to pick them up, they spread the news and cheered. The returning overseas Chinese from Bandung, who had been forcibly concentrated, said that after being concentrated, they were deprived of their means of livelihood and faced a desperate situation. The motherland sent ships in a timely manner to rescue them from the sea of ​​misery. The old overseas Chinese Lin Guanlu, who returned with his family of eight, burst into tears when he talked about the warm welcome of the people of the motherland when they returned. He said: "Since stepping on the soil of the motherland, I have begun to search my mind for the most beautiful words, preparing to write a poem to express my feelings for the motherland." Yesterday, he wrote more than a dozen poems in the classical style to thank the motherland for helping him "escape from suffering and celebrate reunion." Many returning overseas Chinese also wrote down the kindness of the motherland in their diaries. A young returning overseas Chinese surnamed Lin wrote in his diary: "Motherland, you love me like a mother loves her son. I will definitely do my best to build the motherland and repay you and Chairman Mao's kindness."

"Contributing one's strength to the socialist construction of the motherland" is the common language of the overseas Chinese. Regardless of gender, age, or youth, many people expressed their complete obedience to the needs of the motherland. Many people, after boarding the ships sent by the motherland, wrote down their ideals and wishes in the returning overseas Chinese registration form: "Build the motherland and obey the needs of the motherland." A young couple expressed: "A strong motherland is our home everywhere. Wherever the motherland needs us, we will go there." The sixty-year-old returning overseas Chinese Xu Zuoming, who planted potatoes in Indonesia for more than 20 years, was happy to tell people after hearing that potatoes could be grown in Fujian: "If the motherland needs me, I will go to Fujian to participate in construction. Although that is not my hometown, I will not feel lonely. The People's Government and the people of the motherland are my best relatives!"

    归来倍觉祖国亲
    归国侨胞感谢党和政府的关怀
    新华社广州3日电　29日回国的印度尼西亚华侨都非常感激祖国对他们的关怀爱护，他们说，祖国的恩情比天高、比海深。
    在印度尼西亚饱受磨折的侨胞们说，他们能够回到幸福的祖国，是强大的祖国关怀爱护的结果。从苏甲武眉回来的侨胞说，他们向往祖国的社会主义建设，许多人都要求回国，但是遭到了许多阻挠。当他们从收音机里和从报纸上知道祖国派船去接他们的时候，纷纷奔走相告，欢呼雀跃。曾被强迫集中的万隆归侨说，他们被集中以后，被剥夺了谋生的手段，面临绝境。祖国及时派去船只，使他们脱离了苦海。一家八口回来的老归侨林官禄，一谈起祖国人民欢迎他们回国的热烈场面时，热泪便夺眶而出。他说：“自从踏入祖国的土地以后，脑子里就开始搜索最美丽的词句，准备写一首诗表达自己对祖国的心意。”昨天，他写出了十多首古体诗感谢祖国帮助他“脱离患难庆团圆”。许多归侨还在日记中记下了祖国的恩情。一位姓林的青年归侨在日记中写道：“祖国，你像娘亲爱护儿子一样爱护我。我一定尽自己的力量，建设祖国，来报答您和毛主席的恩情。”
    “为祖国社会主义建设贡献自己的力量”，这是侨胞们的共同语言。不论男女、老年人或是青年人，许多人都表示完全服从祖国的需要。许多人登上祖国派去的轮船后，便在归侨登记表中写下了自己的理想和愿望：“建设祖国，服从祖国的需要。”一对青年夫妇这样表示：“强大的祖国，到处是我们的家。祖国需要我到那里，我们便去那里”。六十岁的老年归侨徐作明，在印度尼西亚种了二十多年马铃薯，回国后听说福建可以种马铃薯，高兴地对人说：“如果祖国需要我，我便去福建参加建设。那里虽然不是我的家乡，但我不会感到孤独。人民政府、祖国人民就是我的最好的亲人！”
