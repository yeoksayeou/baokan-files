Xinhua News Agency, March 16th: In various regions, the implementation of the Party's policy on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has led to significant progress in the work of Western medicine doctors learning TCM.

Since the Central Committee of the Party issued its instruction on the summary report of the Party Group of the Ministry of Health regarding organizing Western medicine doctors to leave their posts to study TCM on November 18, 1958, various regions have earnestly implemented it, adopting various effective measures to launch a mass movement for Western medicine doctors to study TCM. Currently, there are thirty-seven TCM study classes for Western medicine doctors leaving their posts for approximately two years, organized by various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. These classes have over 2,300 participants, including Western medicine professors, lecturers, and doctors. According to incomplete statistics, there are over 36,000 Western medicine doctors in various regions who are combining their professional work with learning TCM. The study of acupuncture therapy by Western medicine doctors is even more widespread. In many provinces such as Gansu, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangxi, over 80% of Western medicine doctors have mastered acupuncture therapy through short-term training courses and other methods, and are able to use acupuncture to treat common diseases.

The methods for Western medicine doctors to learn TCM are flexible and diverse, generally adopting the "four-sides" and "five-combinations" approach. The "four sides" are: learning, applying, researching, and promoting simultaneously. The "five combinations" are: combining off-the-job study with on-the-job study, combining theoretical study with clinical practice, combining crash courses with regular study, combining systematic theoretical study with focused in-depth study, and combining group lessons with learning from a master and self-study. In terms of on-the-job spare-time learning, Beijing, Tianjin, Chengdu, and other places with a relatively high concentration of Western medicine doctors have organized spare-time classes, with concentrated classes for four to eight hours per week, with a duration of six months to three years. Henan Province currently has fifty-four such classes, with 1,817 Western medicine doctors participating. In areas where Western medicine doctors are more dispersed, the approach is often to have a master guide an apprentice, or to start with clinical learning of one disease and one prescription under the guidance of TCM doctors, combined with regular classes and self-study, gradually achieving systematic learning.

In the process of carrying out Western medicine doctors learning TCM, whether it is off-the-job learning or on-the-job learning, the principle of "systematic learning, comprehensive mastery, consolidation and improvement" and the integration of theory with practice have been implemented. Generally, they first study Chairman Mao's works and the Party's policy on TCM, and then study relevant TCM business courses. In the process of learning, theory and practice are closely integrated through various forms such as TCM and Western medicine consultations, clinical practice, and case discussions.

Through Western medicine doctors learning TCM, the unity and cooperation between TCM and Western medicine have been further enhanced, and a new atmosphere of mutual respect, mutual learning, and learning from each other's strengths has generally formed. Through the unity and cooperation of TCM and Western medicine, not only has the efficacy of treating common diseases been improved, the treatment period shortened, and the cost reduced, but also satisfactory results have been achieved in the treatment of many difficult and complicated diseases, such as hypertension, advanced schistosomiasis, and hepatitis. Valuable clinical experience and preliminary patterns for preventing and treating certain diseases have been summarized. In Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and other places, TCM and Western medicine doctors have used modern science to study TCM, Chinese herbal medicine, acupuncture, and Qigong, and have achieved preliminary results, some of which have even been written into valuable academic papers. These research efforts are of great significance for consolidating and improving the legacy of the motherland's medicine, enriching modern medical science, and creating a new school of medicine in our country.

The work of Western medicine doctors learning TCM has received attention from local Party committees and health departments. Many provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have established Western Medicine Learning TCM Committees, led by the Party Secretary, who gives reports to the TCM learning classes and regularly attends lectures and discussions, understands the students' learning, life, and ideological situation, and strengthens political and ideological leadership. They also actively find ways to solve problems such as teachers, teaching materials, study time, and equipment, so that the work of Western medicine doctors learning TCM is developing more deeply.

### 西医学习中医日益普遍  增强了中西医团结　提高了医疗效果

    西医学习中医日益普遍
    增强了中西医团结　提高了医疗效果
    据新华社16日讯　各地贯彻党的中医政策，西医学习中医工作获得很大发展。
    自从1958年11月18日，党中央发布了对卫生部党组关于组织西医离职学习中医总结报告的批示后，各地认真贯彻执行，采取各种有效措施开展西医学习中医的群众运动。目前，各省、市、自治区举办的为期两年左右的西医离职学习中医班已有三十七个，参加学习的有西医教授、讲师和医生等二千三百多人，各地在职西医结合业务学习中医的，据不完全统计约有三万六千多名。各地学习针灸治疗的西医更为普遍。甘肃、河南、安徽、江西等很多省已有80％以上的西医通过短期训练班等方式掌握了针灸疗法，能用针灸治疗一般疾病。
    各地西医学习中医的方式方法灵活多样，一般是采取“四边”、“五结合”的方法，“四边”即边学，边用，边研究，边推广；“五结合”是离职学习和在职学习相结合，理论学习和临床实习相结合，突击学习和经常学习相结合，系统理论学习和重点深入学习相结合，集体上课和拜师自修相结合。在职业余学习方面，北京、天津、成都等西医比较集中的地方举办业余学习班，每周集中上课四至八小时，学制半年至三年不等，河南省目前类似这样的学习班有五十四个，参加学习的西医有一千八百一十七名。西医比较分散的地区，多采取师傅带徒弟，或在中医指导下从一病一方的临床学习开始，结合定期上课和自学，逐步达到系统的学习。
    在开展西医学习中医的过程中，无论是离职学习或是在职学习，都贯彻了“系统学习、全面掌握、整理提高”和理论联系实际的方针。一般都先学了毛主席的著作和党的中医政策，再学习有关中医业务等方面的课程。学习过程中，还通过中西医会诊、临床实习和病案讨论等各种形式，把理论和实际紧密结合起来。
    通过西医学习中医，中西医的团结合作有了进一步的增强，普遍形成了一种彼此尊重、互相学习、取长补短的新风气。通过中西医的团结合作，不仅对一般的疾病提高了疗效，缩短了疗程，降低了费用，而且在不少疑难病症，如高血压、晚期血吸虫病、肝炎等的治疗方面，收到了满意的效果，总结出很多有价值的临床经验和防治某些疾病的初步规律；北京、上海和武汉等地中西医运用现代科学研究中医、中药和针灸气功，已得到初步成绩，有的还写出了有价值的学术论文。这些研究工作，对整理提高祖国医学遗产、丰富现代医学科学和创立我国的新医学派都具有重大意义。
    西医学习中医的工作，受到各地党委和卫生部门的重视，很多省、市、自治区成立了西医学习中医委员会，由党委书记挂帅，给中医学习班作报告和经常参加听课、讨论，了解学员们的学习、生活和思想情况，加强了政治思想领导工作。并积极设法解决师资、教材、学习时间和设备等问题，从而使西医学习中医工作日益深入发展。
