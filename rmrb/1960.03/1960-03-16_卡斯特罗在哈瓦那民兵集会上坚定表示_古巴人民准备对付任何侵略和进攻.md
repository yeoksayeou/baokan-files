Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 14th: Cuban Prime Minister Castro this morning called on the Cuban people to be mentally prepared for a long-term struggle. He said that the people should neither relax their vigilance nor abandon the task of construction.

Castro made these remarks at a militia rally held at the University of Havana to commemorate the third anniversary of the Cuban students' attack on the Presidential Palace.

Prime Minister Castro emphasized in his speech that the Cuban people have two major tasks: defending the revolution and advancing the revolution. He said that the image of the Cuban people is: a rifle to defend the revolution next to a work certificate.

Castro condemned the enemies of the revolution for surrounding Cuba with military bases, not only through threats, but also in order to launch an offensive against Cuba at the appropriate time. He emphasized that there have been more than forty air raids on Cuban territory. It is not the fault of the Cuban people that they buy weapons for self-defense, but the fault of the enemies of the Cuban people and the motherland. He emphasized, "We have no reason to allow the revolutionary cause to stagnate, because if the enemy manages to make the revolution stagnate, then the revolution will fail."

Referring to the economic threats Cuba faces, Castro said that the sugar law formulated by the US government and to be submitted to Congress is the worst form of threat and retaliation against the sovereignty of a country. This threat is to put the Cuban economy in the hands of a foreign president. Castro emphasized that the Cuban people are able to resist economic aggression.

Castro pointed out that the Cuban people should be mentally prepared for a long-term struggle, because the roots of these aggressions are powerful. He said that it does not matter how many years the struggle must be waged. The Cuban people are prepared to pay this price for the sovereignty and progress that have already been won. The Cuban people are ready to deal with any aggression and attack, no matter where it comes from.

Castro pointed out that the enemies of the revolution have tried to isolate the Cuban people from the people of Latin America. The enemy tried to destroy the revolution, less to protect the interests of the affected capitalist groups, but rather to avoid making the Cuban revolution an example for the people of other Latin American countries. He said that the enemy's attempt to incite the people of Latin America against Cuba has not been achieved. They got the complete opposite. The Cuban revolution has received great sympathy in Latin America, and even in the United States.

Castro emphasized that in the face of a formidable enemy, the people must not show weakness at any time. He said, "We are convinced that we will surely defeat the enemy."

Castro also praised the struggle of the Algerian people. He said that Algerian patriots are successfully fighting against a well-equipped army of more than 500,000 men, but this has not discouraged them.

Prime Minister Castro's speech was constantly interrupted by applause and slogans. Cuban militiamen in gray shirts and black berets, as well as other people attending the meeting, constantly shouted: "Down with US imperialism!"

Shaumont, Secretary-General of the Cuban Revolutionary Guidance Committee, also spoke at the militia rally.

Earlier today, Cuban President Dorticos spoke to the cheering Cuban militia in the square in front of the Presidential Palace. He praised the heroic actions of the Cuban students in the battle to attack Batista's Presidential Palace. He said, "Today, it is no longer a small group of brave patriots, but all the Cuban people who have united to liberate the country from foreign rule." He also said that Cuba is determined to achieve economic liberation.

At the ceremony on the evening of the 13th to hand over the Larrissa Barracks, which had been renamed "March 13th" Student City, to the Ministry of Education, Raul Castro, Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba, delivered a speech. He strongly condemned the enemies of the Cuban revolution for attempting to isolate the Cuban revolution in order to create an excuse to invade Cuba. He said, however, that a recent visit by a president to South American countries proves that Cubans are not isolated and that their cause is the cause of all Latin America. Cuba is Cuba for Cubans and Latin Americans, but never for Americans. He emphasized that no matter who the aggressor is, the united people will rise up and crush them.

On the 13th, people all over Cuba participated in grand commemorative meetings, including workers, farmers, and student militiamen. In Havana, rebel leaders, senior officers, rebel soldiers and militiamen held demonstrations, laying flowers at the various locations where the martyrs of Havana were sacrificed. Tens of thousands of Cuban militiamen also participated in a parade held at an airport of the rebel army.

Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 14th: Sixty-five Cuban parties and people's organizations with various tendencies issued a joint statement today, condemning the conspiracy of US imperialism against the Cuban revolution, and expressing their support for the Cuban revolutionary government. The statement also called on people's organizations in Latin America and around the world to support the struggle of the Cuban people.

The statement, adopted on the 11th by sixty-five Cuban parties and people's organizations, condemned the criminal activities of US imperialism in interfering in Cuba. The statement said that as the Cuban revolution continues to advance, the enemies of the revolution have intensified their aggression against Cuba. They burned Cuban sugarcane fields from planes taking off from the United States, bombed Cuban sugar mills and cities, carried out economic destruction against Cuba, and prepared for armed invasion of Cuba. The statement pointed out that the criminal activities organized by US government officials to bomb the "La Coubre" ship were part of this conspiracy, the purpose of which was to obstruct Cuba from purchasing weapons needed to defend its sovereignty.

The statement also condemned the US news agencies for conducting "propaganda aimed at obstructing the patriotic cause of Cuban national independence" through slander.

The statement emphasized that faced with all threats and dangers, "all noble and patriotic Cubans have stepped forward to respond to the call for liberation and revolution: rather die without a motherland."

The statement said that the parties and people's organizations passed a resolution supporting Prime Minister Castro's condemnation of the culprits who caused the "La Coubre" explosion and the Cuban revolutionary government's response to the insulting statement by US Secretary of State Herter. In the resolution, the parties and people's organizations expressed their enthusiastic assistance in promoting revolutionary measures, especially advancing land reform and industrialization plans, strengthening the people's military preparedness to defend the revolution, and cooperating in the national fundraising for the purchase of weapons and aircraft.

The statement called on the people of Latin America and the world to "further strengthen their international support."

The Cuban parties and people's organizations that signed the statement include: the July 26th Movement, the People's Socialist Party, the Cuban Workers' Federation, the Revolutionary Guidance Committee, the Catholic Workers' Youth League, the National Revolutionary League of Lawyers, the Executive Committee of the Week of Support for the People of Latin America, the National Coffee Growers Association, the National Association of Journalists, the trade unions and organizations of freelancers, cultural organizations, militias, and Masonic organizations.

    卡斯特罗在哈瓦那民兵集会上坚定表示
    古巴人民准备对付任何侵略和进攻
    古巴六十五个政党团体声明支持革命政府反对美国干涉
    据新华社哈瓦那14日电　古巴总理卡斯特罗今天清晨号召古巴人民在精神上做好长期斗争的准备。他说，人民既不应该放松警惕，也不应该放弃建设的任务。
    卡斯特罗是在为纪念古巴大学生袭击总统府三周年而在哈瓦那大学举行的民兵集会上讲这番话的。
    卡斯特罗总理在讲话中强调指出，在古巴人民面前有两大任务：保卫革命和推进革命。他说，古巴人民的形象表现是：劳动证书旁边放着保卫革命的步枪。
    卡斯特罗谴责革命的敌人不仅通过威胁，而且用军事基地包围着古巴，以便在适当的时候对古巴发动进攻。他强调指出，对古巴领土的空袭已经有四十多次。古巴人民购买武器进行自卫并不是古巴人民的过错，而是古巴人民和祖国的敌人的过错。他强调说，“我们没有任何理由使革命事业停滞下来，因为，如果敌人竟然使革命停滞下来，那么革命就失败了。”
    卡斯特罗在谈到古巴遭到的经济威胁时说，美国政府制订的、准备向国会提出的食糖法是对一个国家主权的最坏的威胁方式和报复手段。这种威胁是要使古巴的经济掌握在一个外国总统的手里。卡斯特罗强调指出，古巴人民能够抵抗经济侵略。
    卡斯特罗指出，古巴人民应该在精神上做好长期斗争的准备，因为发动这些侵略的根源是强大的。他说，必须进行斗争的年月有多长是没有关系的。为了已经赢得的主权和进步，古巴人民准备付出这种代价。古巴人民已经准备好对付任何侵略和进攻，不管这种侵略和进攻来自何方。
    卡斯特罗指出，革命的敌人曾力图把古巴人民从拉丁美洲人民中孤立起来。敌人力图摧毁革命，这与其说是为了维护受影响的资本集团的利益，毋宁说是为了避免使古巴革命成为拉丁美洲其他国家人民的榜样。他说，敌人企图引起拉丁美洲人民反对古巴的目的没有达到。他们得到了完全相反的东西。古巴革命在拉丁美洲，甚至在美国，都得到了极大的同情。
    卡斯特罗强调指出，大敌当前，人民任何时候都不能示弱。他说，“我们确信，我们一定战胜敌人。”
    卡斯特罗还赞扬了阿尔及利亚人民的斗争。他说，阿尔及利亚的爱国者正在成功地抗击着一支拥有五十多万装备精良的军队，但是这并没有使他们泄气。
    卡斯特罗总理的讲话不断为掌声和口号声所打断。身穿灰色衬衣和头戴黑色贝雷帽的古巴民兵以及其他到会群众不断高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”
    古巴革命指导委员会总书记肖蒙也在这次民兵集会上讲了话。
    今天早些时候，古巴总统多尔蒂科斯曾在总统府前面的广场上向欢呼着的古巴民兵讲话。他赞扬了古巴学生在袭击巴蒂斯塔总统府的战斗中的英勇行动。他说，“今天，已经不是一小批勇敢的爱国者，而是全体古巴人民都团结了起来，以便从外国统治下把国家解放出来。”他还说，古巴决心获得经济的解放。
    在13日晚间举行的把已经改为“3月13日”学生城的拉利萨军营移交给教育部的仪式上，古巴革命武装部长劳尔·卡斯特罗发表了讲话。他强烈指责古巴革命的敌人企图孤立古巴革命，以便制造口实来侵略古巴。他说，但是，一位总统最近对南美国家的访问证明，古巴人不是孤立的，他们的事业是全拉丁美洲的事业。古巴是古巴人和拉丁美洲人的古巴，但永远不是美国人的古巴。他强调指出，不管侵略者是谁，团结起来的人民都将起来把他们击溃。
    13日这一天，古巴全国各地的人民都参加了盛大的纪念会，参加这些集会的有工人、农民和学生民兵。在哈瓦那，起义军领袖、高级军官、起义军的士兵和民兵一起举行了示威，他们到哈瓦那烈士们牺牲的各个地点献了花。成千上万的古巴民兵还参加了在起义军的一个飞机场举行的阅兵式。
    新华社哈瓦那14日电　古巴具有各种倾向的六十五个党派和人民团体今天发表联合声明，谴责美帝国主义反对古巴革命的阴谋，并且表示支持古巴革命政府。声明同时呼吁拉丁美洲和全世界的人民团体支援古巴人民的斗争。
    古巴六十五个党派和人民团体在11日通过的这项声明谴责美帝国主义干涉古巴的罪恶活动。声明说，当古巴革命继续前进的时候，革命的敌人就变本加厉地对古巴进行侵略活动。他们通过从美国起飞的飞机焚烧古巴的甘蔗田，轰炸古巴的制糖厂和城市，对古巴进行经济破坏，并且准备武装侵略古巴。声明指出，美国政府官员组织的轰炸“勒库布尔号”轮船的罪恶活动，是这个阴谋的一部分，其目的是阻挠古巴购买保卫它的主权所需要的武器。
    声明还谴责美国的通讯社通过诽谤，进行“旨在阻挠古巴民族独立的爱国事业的宣传”。
    声明强调指出，面临着一切威胁和危险，“所有高尚和爱国的古巴人都挺身而起，响应没有祖国毋宁死的解放和革命的号召”。
    声明说，各党派和人民团体通过决议，支持卡斯特罗总理对制造爆炸“勒库布尔号”事件的祸首的谴责和古巴革命政府对美国国务卿赫脱的侮辱性声明的答复。各党派和人民团体在决议中表示将热烈协助推行革命措施，特别是推进土地改革和工业化计划，加强人民对保卫革命的军事准备，在购买武器和飞机的全国募捐中进行合作。
    声明呼吁拉丁美洲和世界各国人民“进一步加强他们的国际支援力量”。
    签署这项声明的古巴党派和人民团体包括：7月26日运动、人民社会党、古巴工人联合会、革命指导委员会、天主教工人青年联盟、全国律师革命联盟、支援拉丁美洲人民周执行委员会、全国咖啡种植者协会、全国新闻工作者协会、自由职业者的工会和团体、文化组织、民兵和共济会团体等。（附图片）
