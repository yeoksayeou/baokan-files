Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 15th. The "Russia" and "Yakutia," two ships sent by the Chinese government to pick up overseas Chinese, arrived at Tanjung Priok Port in Jakarta on the 15th. The "Hai Huang" and "Da Bao Kang," which arrived in Jakarta on the 11th and 12th respectively, have not yet left. Currently, there are four ships picking up overseas Chinese docked in Jakarta.

More than two thousand overseas Chinese compatriots are gathered in Jakarta waiting for the second batch of ships to return to their homeland, anxiously awaiting boarding. Among these displaced overseas Chinese, those from Labuhan and Bogor have been waiting in Jakarta for more than half a month. Overseas Chinese who suffered from the major fire in Bangka, West Kalimantan, are also anxiously waiting for ships sent by their motherland to immediately go to Bangka to pick them up and return home.

With the consent of the relevant Indonesian authorities, the "Hai Huang" ship had completed all the procedures and was originally scheduled to set sail on the 12th to Bangka to pick up overseas Chinese. However, just as this ship began to sail on the 12th, it received a notice from the relevant Indonesian authorities stating that it was not allowed to sail on the 12th because "certain internal contacts" still needed to be made, and it had to wait until the morning of the 14th to leave Jakarta. However, until now, it is still unknown when this ship will be able to sail to Bangka.

Bangka is a major residential area for overseas Chinese in Indonesia. The main areas of Bangka were destroyed by a major fire some time ago. More than four thousand overseas Chinese have become homeless after the fire, and they are eager to return to their motherland to rebuild their homes. The Chinese Embassy in Indonesia has sent Consul Mao Xin-yu to West Kalimantan to handle relevant matters and inspect the situation of the overseas Chinese there. He has made appropriate arrangements with the West Kalimantan authorities for the repatriation of these overseas Chinese.

The "Da Bao Kang" ship came to pick up displaced overseas Chinese who arrived in Jakarta from West Java two weeks ago to return to China. On the afternoon of the 14th, this ship received a notice from the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating that it could only carry luggage on the 14th and could not allow passengers to board. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also said that it would not be able to leave here until after the 17th.

The displaced overseas Chinese gathered in Jakarta were overjoyed to hear the news that they could board the ship on the morning of the 14th. Hundreds of overseas Chinese even took buses to the port without eating breakfast. However, due to the temporary prohibition by the relevant Indonesian authorities, they had to return to Jakarta.

### 我接运华侨的轮船受到阻挠滞留雅加达

    我接运华侨的轮船受到阻挠滞留雅加达新华社雅加达15日电　中国政府派来接运华侨的“俄罗斯号”和“亚库契亚号”两艘轮船15日到达雅加达的丹绒不碌港。在这以前分别在11日和12日到达雅加达的“海皇号”和“大宝康号”两艘轮船尚未离开。目前，共有四艘接运华侨的轮船停泊在雅加达。
    在雅加达集中等待第二批船只回国的华侨同胞达两千多人，他们焦急地等待上船；在这些流离失所的华侨当中，那些来自拉布汉和茂物的华侨已经在雅加达等了半个多月。在西加里曼丹邦戛遭到大火灾的那些华侨也焦急地等候祖国派来的船能立即开到邦戛去接他们回国。
    “海皇号”轮船在印度尼西亚有关当局的同意下已经办完了一切手续，原定在12日就启航去邦戛接运华侨。但是，就在这艘船12日开始航行的时候，它得到印度尼西亚有关当局的通知说，它在12日不许开船，因为还要进行“某些内部接触”，必须等到14日上午才能离开雅加达。可是，直到现在，这艘轮船什么时候才能开往邦戛，还不知道。
    邦戛是在印度尼西亚的华侨居住的主要地方。邦戛的主要地区前些时候已被大火烧毁。四千多名华侨在大火以后变得无家可归，他们渴望返回祖国重建家园。中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆已经派毛欣禹领事前往西加里曼丹处理有关事务，并视察那里的华侨情况。他已经同西加里曼丹当局作好了遣送这些华侨回国的适当安排。
    “大宝康号”轮船是来接两星期以前从西爪哇到达雅加达的流离失所的华侨返回中国的。14日下午这艘轮船接到印度尼西亚外交部的通知说，它在14日只能载运行李，而不得让乘客上船。外交部还说，它要到17日以后才能离开这里。
    在雅加达集中的流离失所的华侨在听到14日清晨就可以上船的消息以后，都万分兴奋。数以百计的华侨甚至没有吃早饭就乘车前去港口。但是由于印度尼西亚有关当局临时不准人上船，他们不得不折回雅加达。
