    The East-West Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee opened in Geneva on the afternoon of the 15th.

    The heads of the delegations of the ten participating countries (Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, United States, Britain, France, Canada, Italy) made brief statements at the meeting.

    The head of the Soviet delegation, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Zorin, read out a congratulatory letter from Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Khrushchev, to the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee at the meeting. Zorin then said in his speech that the Disarmament Committee faced a historically significant task: to formulate an agreement on the implementation of complete and thorough disarmament under international supervision. Zorin pointed out that the proposal put forward by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Khrushchev, on behalf of the Soviet people at the 14th session of the United Nations General Assembly on September 18, 1959, to achieve complete and thorough disarmament by all countries in three stages over four years has won the support of the majority of people in all countries on all continents of the world.

    Zorin pointed out that the Soviet government, for its part, is doing its best to ensure that the plan for complete and thorough disarmament is realized in the shortest possible time. Without waiting for an international agreement on complete and thorough disarmament to be reached, the Soviet Union unilaterally reduced its armed forces by 1.2 million men and strived to make the reaching of such an agreement as easy and close as possible. Zorin said that in order to guarantee the interests of lasting peace and peaceful coexistence among all countries, the Ten-Nation Committee should immediately begin to implement the resolutions adopted by the United Nations in favor of complete and thorough disarmament and entrusting the Committee with the Soviet proposals on this issue for detailed discussion. In the course of the discussion, an agreement on complete and thorough disarmament should be formulated, first of all reaching an agreement on the main principles of this agreement.

    The head of the Soviet delegation finally stated that he hoped that the delegations of all countries would carry out practical cooperation in formulating an agreement on complete and thorough disarmament. He emphasized that the representatives of the ten countries participating in the Disarmament Conference "should do everything possible to live up to the expectations of the people of all countries." The heads of the delegations of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria spoke in support of the proposal put forward by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Khrushchev, at the United Nations to achieve complete and thorough disarmament within four years. The head of the Polish delegation, Naszkowski, pointed out that the Soviet disarmament proposal is the most thorough plan. He also pointed out that the plan recently published by the West did not specify any time limit for the measures it stipulated. The head of the Czechoslovak delegation, Nosek, said that Khrushchev's proposal at the United Nations General Assembly provided the most acceptable basis for complete and thorough disarmament. The head of the Romanian delegation, Mănescu, emphasized that any proposal on disarmament should take into account the time limit for implementing this proposal, preferably the shortest possible time limit. He pointed out that the Western plan did not even mention the issue of an agreement on the cessation of nuclear testing. The head of the Bulgarian delegation, Tarabanov, also pointed out when talking about the Western joint plan that the Western plan did not mention the time limit for implementing the measures stipulated in the plan, nor did it mention the abolition of military bases on foreign territories.

    The representatives of the five Western countries defended the Western joint plan at the meeting. The speech of the head of the U.S. delegation, Eaton, fully exposed the U.S.'s lack of sincerity in disarmament. He said, "We must always pay attention to the fact that a disarmed world is not necessarily a safe world." He said, "Hoping that the old human problem of abolishing wars between countries will suddenly be easily solved" is "an unrealizable hope." He actually said, "If we sign some grandiose but empty disarmament plan, some ambitious but unfeasible plan, some plan that is not realistic at the moment, then we are just deceiving ourselves and the millions of people who long for peace and long to be free from the terror of possible wars." He emphasized the need to establish an international disarmament organization to determine the initial measures for disarmament. He admitted that there would be great difficulties in doing so, but at the same time he emphasized the need to establish an international police force. Right at this table for negotiating disarmament, Eaton vigorously promoted the U.S.'s "policy of strength" again. He said, "My country will continue to maintain the strength needed to ensure its security and fulfill its obligations to the world. … Relaxing too early and allowing a situation of imbalance in military strength to exist will not help disarmament, nor will it help achieve the just and reliable peace we seek." The head of the British delegation, Ormsby-Gore, emphasized the need to "maintain balance" in armaments and said that the Western plan would provide a basis for reaching an agreement. The working meeting of the Ten-Nation Disarmament Committee will begin on the 16th.

    东西方十国裁军会议开幕
    苏联代表要求就裁军主要原则达成协议
    美国代表叫嚷仍要维持美国需要的实力
    本报综合报道　东西方十国裁军委员会15日下午在日内瓦开幕。
    参加会议的十国（苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、美国、英国、法国、加拿大、意大利）的代表团团长作了简短的发言。
    苏联代表团团长、苏联外交部副部长佐林在会上宣读了苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫给十国裁军委员会的贺信。佐林接着致词说，在裁军委员会面前摆着一个具有重大历史意义的任务——拟定在国际监督下实现全面彻底裁军的协议。佐林指出，1959年9月18日苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫代表苏联人民在联合国大会第十四届会议上提出的在四年内分三阶段实现各国全面彻底裁军的建议获得了全世界各洲所有国家的大多数人民的支持。
    佐林指出，苏联政府在自己方面尽力使全面彻底裁军计划在最短期限内实现。苏联没有等待达成全面彻底裁军的国际协议就单方面裁减了武装部队一百二十万人，并力争最大限度地使达成这种协议变得容易和接近起来。佐林说，为了保证持久和平和各国和平共处的利益，十国委员会应当立即开始实现联合国所通过的、赞成全面彻底裁军主张和把苏联关于这一问题的建议交给委员会详细讨论的决议。在讨论过程中应当制定全面彻底裁军协定，首先是就这一协定的主要原则达成协议。
    苏联代表团团长最后表示，他希望各国代表团在制定全面彻底裁军协定方面进行切实的合作。他强调参加裁军会议的十个国家的代表“应当尽一切努力不辜负各国人民的期望。”波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚代表团团长发言支持苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在联合国提出的在四年内实现全面、彻底裁军的建议。波兰代表团团长纳希科夫斯基指出，苏联的裁军建议是最彻底的计划。他还指出，西方最近公布的计划在它规定的措施方面没有确定任何期限。捷克斯洛伐克代表团团长诺塞克说，赫鲁晓夫在联合国大会提出的建议，为全面彻底裁军提供了最可以接受的基础。罗马尼亚代表团团长米辛契斯库强调指出，在裁军方面的任何建议，都应当考虑到实行这一建议的期限，最好是最短的期限。他指出，西方的计划，甚至没有提到关于停止核试验协议问题。保加利亚代表团团长塔拉巴诺夫谈到西方联合计划时也指出，西方计划既没有谈到实行计划中所规定的措施的期限，也没有谈到取消外国领土上的军事基地。
    西方五国代表在会上为西方的联合计划辩护。美国代表团团长伊顿的发言，充分暴露了美国没有裁军诚意，他说：“我们必须时刻注意，一个实现裁军的世界并不一定是一个安全的世界”，他说：“希望废除各国之间的战争这个人类老问题之一会突然获得轻易的解决”，是“一种不能实现的希望”。他竟说：“如果我们在某种冠冕堂皇的但是很空洞的裁军计划、某种雄心勃勃但是不能实行的计划、某种时机不切合实际的计划上面签名，那末我们只是在欺骗我们自己以及千百万渴望和平、渴望摆脱可能发生的战争的恐怖的人们。”他强调必须建立一个国际裁军组织来确定裁军方面的初步措施，他承认这样作会有巨大困难，但是他同时又强调必须建立国际警察部队。就在这一谈判裁军的桌上，伊顿又大肆鼓吹美国的“实力政策”。他说，“我的国家将继续维持确保其安全以及履行其对世界的义务所需要的实力。……为时过早地松弛下来，让一种在军事力量上不平衡的状况存在下去，是无助于裁军的，无助于实现我们所寻求的正义的和可靠的和平的。”英国代表团团长奥姆斯比—戈尔强调必须在军备方面“保持均势”，并且说什么西方计划将提供达成协议的基础。十国裁军委员会工作会议将在16日开始举行。
