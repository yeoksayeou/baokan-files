Xinhua News Agency, March 19th: Over 30,000 wild plant resource surveyors across the country, after a year of surveying, have discovered and identified more than 2,000 kinds of wild fibers, medicinal materials, starches, fats, oils, and aromatic raw materials, etc. This provides a more ample source of raw materials for China's light industry production. These wild plants have very high utilization value, and many plants also contain multiple components that can be comprehensively utilized.

The seeds of plants such as *Machilus pauhoi*, *Erythrophleum fordii*, *Eriobotrya cavaleriei*, *Microcos paniculata*, and *Litsea nigrescens* found in Hainan Island, Yunnan, Guangdong, Guangxi, the Emei Mountains, and the Three Gorges area of the Yangtze River, have very high oil content. Scientific tests show that *Machilus pauhoi* seeds have an oil content of up to 72%, *Erythrophleum fordii* seeds reach 78%, and *Litsea nigrescens* seeds reach 47%. The oils from these plants can be used to make soap and lubricants, and the oilseed cakes can also be used as feed or fertilizer.

National wild starch raw material resources exceed 10 million tons. Among them, acorns, kudzu root, fern root, *Smilax glabra*, *Heterostemma alatum*, *Rosa laevigata*, and *Lycoris radiata*, etc., contain 30%-50% starch or sugars, making them excellent raw materials for brewing and sizing. If one-tenth of the national wild starch resources are used annually to distill alcohol, it could increase alcohol production by more than 200,000 tons, saving the country 1 billion catties of grain.

The phloem of over a hundred kinds of wild plants growing in various regions, such as *Urtica cannabina*, *Humulus scandens*, *Celastrus orbiculatus*, *Pueraria lobata*, *Hibiscus mutabilis*, *Grewia biloba*, *Tilia amurensis*, *Apocynum venetum*, and *Boehmeria nivea var. tenacissima*, can replace jute, ramie, or cotton for spinning, weaving, and manufacturing packaging, labor protection, and other supplies. This survey revealed that *Urtica cannabina* and *Celastrus orbiculatus* are distributed almost nationwide, and *Bombax ceiba* is found in various southern provinces. Their fiber fineness and tensile strength are excellent and can be blended with cotton and wool to make excellent textiles.

There are even more varieties and richer resources of grass fibers that can be used for papermaking throughout the country. According to estimates from twelve provinces, *Eulaliopsis binata* resources amount to more than 3.5 million dan (a Chinese unit of weight, approximately 50 kg). Plants such as *Wikstroemia canescens* and wild cotton, which are used to manufacture pi-la paper, are produced almost everywhere in the south.

In terms of tannin raw materials, in addition to the large amount of *Quercus variabilis* cupules, *Dioscorea cirrhosa*, *Liquidambar formosana*, and other major tannin-containing plant resources that have already been heavily utilized, many new tannin-containing plants have also been discovered. For example, several species of Compositae and Polygonaceae herbaceous plants that grow commonly throughout the country were rarely utilized domestically or internationally in the past, but it has now been proven that they can be used to make tannin extract. In addition, the survey team further clarified the wild resources of medicinal materials, resins, and gums.

This survey also discovered some rare and precious plants that were previously seldom seen. For example, in the Sichuan mountains at an altitude of 3,000-4,000 meters, medicinal materials that can be used to produce highly effective cardiotonic and sedative drugs were discovered; in Guangdong, an important drug specifically for treating malaria was found; in Yunnan, medicinal materials for manufacturing the anti-hypertensive drug "Shou Bi Nan" were located; and in many areas, precious hormone raw materials were also discovered, which can be used to make medicines to treat rheumatoid arthritis. *Vanilla planifolia*, which is widely used in the fragrance industry, and sandalwood, which was previously imported from abroad, also had similar plants discovered in Yunnan Province.

This national wild plant resource survey team is jointly composed of scientific research, commercial, industrial, and university departments from various provinces and regions. In the survey process, they implemented the policy of combining professional surveys with mass surveys and received enthusiastic support from the masses. Many mountain residents, herdsmen, and herbalists actively reported "strange flowers" and "exotic grasses," helped collect specimens, acted as guides for the survey team, and provided detailed introductions to the folk collection and utilization methods of various wild plants.

    野生植物大有用场
    全国查出二千多种野生植物可加工利用
    据新华社19日讯　全国三万多名野生植物资源普查人员，经过一年来的普查，已经发现和查明了两千多种野生纤维、药材、淀粉、脂肪、油料和芳香原料等野生植物。为我国轻工业生产提供了更为充分的原料来源。这些野生植物的利用价值都很高，很多植物还含有多种成分，可以综合利用。
    海南岛、云南、广东、广西、峨嵋山区、长江三峡地区发现的卵叶樟、铁力木、山枇杷、小红果、黑壳楠等植物的子实等，都有很高的含油量。经科学化验，卵叶樟子含油量达72％，铁力木子达78％，黑壳楠子达47％。这些植物的油脂可以用来做肥皂和润滑剂，油饼还可以用作饲料或肥料。
    全国野生淀粉原料资源在一千万吨以上。其中，橡子、葛根、蕨根、土茯苓、金刚头、金樱子、石蒜等含有30％—50％的淀粉或糖类，是很好的酿造和浆料原料。如果全国每年利用十分之一野生淀粉资源来蒸馏酒精，可以增产酒精二十多万吨，能为国家节省十亿斤粮食。
  生长在各地的螫麻、葎草、南蛇藤、葛藤、木芙蓉、扁担杆、椴麻、罗布麻、野苎麻等百余种野生植物的韧皮，可以代替黄麻、苎麻或棉花来纺纱织布，制造包装、劳动保护等用品。这次查明，螫麻、南蛇藤几乎全国都有分布，肖梵天花南方各省都有，它们的纤维细度和拉力极佳，可以同棉、毛混纺，制成很好的纺织品。
    全国可以用来造纸的草类纤维品种更多，资源更丰富。据十二个省估算，龙须草资源有三百五十多万担。制造皮腊纸的山棉皮、野棉皮等植物，几乎南方到处都产。
  在栲胶原料方面，除已经大量利用的橡碗、薯莨、化香果等大宗含鞣质植物资源以外，还新发现了很多含鞣质植物，像全国普遍生长的几种菊科和蓼科草本植物，过去国内外都很少利用，现在证明可以用来制栲胶。此外，普查人员也进一步查清了药材、树脂、树胶的野生资源。
    这次普查还发现了一些过去少见的珍贵植物。如在拔海三、四千米的四川山区，发现可以制作疗效很高的强心镇静剂的药材，在广东发现了专治疟疾的重要药物，在云南找到了制造治高血压症“寿比南”药片的药材，不少地区还发现了珍贵的激素原料，用它来制成药品可以医治风湿性关节炎。在香料工业中用途十分广泛的香兰素和一向从国外进口的檀香，也在云南省发现了近似的植物。
    这支全国性的野生植物资源普查队伍，是由各省、区科学研究、商业、工业和大专院校等部门共同组成的。在普查过程中，他们贯彻执行了专业人员普查同群众普查相结合的方针，得到了群众的热情支持。许多山区居民、牧民、药农都积极报送“奇花”、“异草”，代为采集标本，为普查队作向导，详细地介绍各种野生草木的民间采集、利用方法。
