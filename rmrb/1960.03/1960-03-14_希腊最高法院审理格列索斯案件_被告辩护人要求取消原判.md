Xinhua News Agency, Athens, March 13th – According to TASS, the Greek Supreme Court began hearing the "case" of Glezos and other Greek patriots on the evening of the 12th. As is known, in July 1959, the Athens Military Tribunal, based on fabricated charges of so-called "espionage," sentenced these Greek patriots to various terms of imprisonment. The defendant's lawyers demanded the annulment of the verdict in the Glezos case and a retrial, arguing that the Military Tribunal had no jurisdiction over the case, that it incorrectly interpreted and applied the provisions of Law No. 375 and the Greek Code of Criminal Procedure during the trial, and that the trial procedures were violated. If the Supreme Court accepts this ground of appeal, the case will be submitted to a non-military court for trial. On the 12th, the defense lawyers explained the substance of the complaint to the judges of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court's ruling is expected in fifteen days, or possibly twenty-eight days.

Lambert, a French jurist representing the International Committee for the Defense of Glezos, Italian jurist Arsenato, and Kruijt, Secretary of the International Organization of Journalists, arrived in Athens by plane on the 11th. However, the authorities detained them as "undesirable persons" at Athens Airport, preventing them from entering Greek territory and forcing them to leave Greece.

    希腊最高法院审理格列索斯案件
    被告辩护人要求取消原判
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社雅典讯：希腊最高法院12日晚间开始审理格列索斯和其他希腊爱国者的“案件”。大家知道，在1959年7月间，雅典军事法庭根据所谓“间谍活动”的诬告，对这些希腊爱国者分别判了刑。被告辩护人要求取消对格列索斯案件的判决和重审这个案件，理由是：军事法庭无权审理这个案件，在审理案件时不正确地解释和运用了第三百七十五号法令和希腊刑事诉讼法典的条款，而且破坏了审讯的程序。如果最高法院接受这个上诉理由，案件将提交非军事法庭审理。辩护人在12日向最高法院的法官阐述了诉状的实质。最高法院的裁决要等十五天，也可能要等二十八天。
    代表国际保卫格列索斯委员会的法国法学家朗贝尔、意大利法学家阿森纳托，以及国际新闻工作者协会秘书克鲁伊契11日乘飞机到达雅典。但是，当局在雅典机场把他们当作“不受欢迎的人”予以拘留，不让他们进入希腊领土，并迫使他们离开了希腊。
