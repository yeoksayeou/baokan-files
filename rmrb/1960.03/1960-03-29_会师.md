    Convergence is a great gathering of revolutionary forces.
    Convergence is for creating and advancing a new revolutionary situation.
    Cadres of five levels in the Huaiyin Special District of Jiangsu, and cadres of four levels in Licheng County of Shandong, converge in the fields to initiate a new revolutionary wave in this year's spring production.
    In their leadership activities, a new situation has emerged: it is not just about levels of command going down, nor just levels of reporting coming up; not just gathering in the leadership organs for meetings, nor just dispersing to various places to inspect work; but rather a close combination from top to bottom, forming a powerful force, going to the forefront of production struggle and ideological struggle. Going directly to participate in the battle, going directly to command the battle, leading production in the most tense places, resolving contradictions in the most acute places. Going to support the newest things, going to absorb the newest experiences, going to master the newest methods, going to breathe the newest air. Look at what the comrades in the Huaiyin Special District are doing when they converge in the fields! – Major revolution in crop layout, major revolution in farming systems, major revolution in sowing technology; setting great ambitions, creating new specifications, establishing high standards. They actively seek out difficulties, seek out contradictions, seek out key points; they resolutely concentrate forces, break through at one point, and drive the entire line. Look at what the comrades in Licheng are doing when they converge in the fields! From ideological revolution to technological revolution, from production measures to living arrangements, from organizational leadership to business management, comprehensively advancing; from the greening of wheat to the preparation for wheat harvesting, from the start of spring sowing to the planning of autumn harvest, from experimental fields, high-yield plots to all farmland, grasping everything to the end. This is truly: the situation is constantly developing, the ideology is constantly revolutionizing, the style of work is constantly improving.
    Convergence is not only a combination of existing forces, but also adds new forces. The wisdom of cadres at all levels is concentrated together, and the wisdom of cadres and the masses is concentrated together, resulting in higher wisdom. New experiences are discovered and promoted more and faster, and new problems are discovered and resolved more and faster. Thus, a new situation of "four more" and "four high" has emerged: more cadres and masses participate in labor, more rationalization proposals from the masses, more drought-resistant water sources are opened up, more tools and machinery are utilized; high labor efficiency, high quality of farm work, high measures for increasing production, and high confidence in victory.
    Convergence in the fields is not only the convergence of cadres at the fourth, fifth, and sixth levels. It is also the convergence of leadership and mass forces, the convergence of revolutionary theory and production practice, and the convergence of science and technology and mass experience. Leading cadres at all levels, experienced farmers, and agricultural technicians in the Huaiyin Special District have come together to launch a major battle. Through "trial sowing," they first solved a series of problems in terms of layout, procedures, organization, labor, technology, and tools for sowing corn according to new specifications, establishing specific high standards. The red flag is in the front, guiding the spring sowing in the entire region to move forward with new vigor at high speed and high quality. Then, using the power of convergence, they universally carry out major inspections and major evaluations to ensure the full realization of the new specifications and high standards for corn sowing. Then, they will converge in the cotton fields to launch a new major battle. In this way, the leadership closely integrates with the masses, politics closely integrates with technology, one battlefield after another, one campaign after another, setting off a spring tide of a great revolution in agricultural production.
    Water from many wells combined can irrigate farther, more, and better; many small springs converge to create huge waves. Convergence in the fields is not a simple combination, but a great convergence and new upsurge of revolutionary spirit, which will inevitably produce even greater revolutionary forces.

    会师

    会师，是革命力量的大汇合。
    会师，是为了创造和推进革命的新形势。
    江苏淮阴专区五级干部会师田间，山东历城县四级干部会师田间，他们要在今年的春季生产中，掀起一个新的革命浪潮。
    在他们的领导活动中，出现了一个新的局面：不只是一级一级布置下去，不只是一级一级报告上来；不只是集中到领导机关开会，不只是分散到各地检查工作；而是从上到下紧密地结合在一起，组成强大的队伍，开到生产斗争和思想斗争的最前线去。去直接参加战斗，去直接指挥战斗，在生产最紧张的地方领导生产，在矛盾最尖锐的地方解决矛盾。去支持最新鲜的事物，去吸取最新鲜的经验，去掌握最新鲜的方法，去呼吸最新鲜的空气。看淮阴专区的同志们，他们会师田间做什么？——作物布局大革新，耕作制度大革新，播种技术大革新；立大志气，创新规格，树高标准。他们主动地寻找困难，寻找矛盾，寻找关键；他们坚决地集中力量，突破一点，带动全线。看历城的同志们，他们会师田间，做什么？从思想革命到技术革命，从生产措施到生活安排，从组织领导到经营管理，全面推进；从小麦返青直到麦收准备，从春播开始直到秋收计划，从试验田、丰产方到全部农田，一抓到底。这真是：形势不断发展，思想不断革命，作风不断改进。
    会师，不只是原有力量的汇合，还增加了新的力量。各级干部的智慧集中在一起，干部和群众的智慧集中在一起，产生了更高的智慧。新经验发现和推广得更多更快了，新问题发现和解决得更多更快了。于是，“四多”“四高”的新局面出现了：干部和群众参加劳动的多，群众性的合理化建议多，抗旱水源开辟的多，工具机械利用得多；劳动工效高，农活质量高，增产措施高，胜利信心高。
    会师田间，不只是四级、五级、六级干部的会师。这也是领导力量和群众力量会师，革命理论和生产实践会师，科学技术和群众经验会师。淮阴专区各级领导干部、有经验的农民和农业技术员汇合在一起，开展了一场大会战，通过“试播”首先从布局、工序、组织、劳力、技术、工具等方面解决了按新规格播种玉米的一系列问题，树立了具体的高标准；红旗在前，引导着全区春播以高速度、高质量的新劲头向前猛进；接着，再运用会师的力量普遍展开大检查、大评比，确保全面实现玉米播种的新规格、高标准。然后，再会师棉田，展开一场新的大会战。这样，领导和群众密切结合，政治和技术密切结合，一个战场又一个战场，一个战役又一个战役，掀起了农业生产大革命的春潮。
    许多井的水合并起来用，就可以浇得更远更多更好；许多小泉汇合起来，就能够掀起巨大的波涛。会师田间不只是简单的汇合，而是革命精神的大汇合和新高涨，它必然会产生更加巨大的革命力量。
