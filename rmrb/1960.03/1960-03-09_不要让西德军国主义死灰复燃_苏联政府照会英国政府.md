Xinhua News Agency, March 5th, Moscow Dispatch: The Soviet government delivered a note to the British government on the 4th regarding the military negotiations between West Germany and Spain.

The note pointed out that West Germany's attempts to establish military cooperation with the Franco government are seriously complicating the situation in Europe. Such attempts run counter to the relaxation of tensions that has already emerged.

The note stated that the British government is one of the signatories to a series of joint agreements on the German question, which have the mission of eradicating German militarism. The Soviet government hopes that the British government will not allow German militarism to revive, and will point Germany in the direction of peaceful and democratic development, using its influence to prevent the implementation of the West German government's military plans.

The note was delivered by the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the British Embassy in the Soviet Union on the 4th. On the same day, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs also delivered two notes with identical content to the embassies of the United States and France in the Soviet Union, respectively.

    不要让西德军国主义死灰复燃
    苏联政府照会英国政府
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府就西德同西班牙之间进行军事谈判一事在4日照会英国政府。
    照会指出，西德同佛朗哥政府建立军事合作的企图，严重地促使欧洲局势复杂化。这种企图同目前已经出现了的紧张局势的缓和是背道而驰的。
    照会说，英国政府是负有根除德国军国主义使命的关于德国问题的一系列共同协定签字国之一。苏联政府希望，英国政府不要让德国军国主义死灰复燃，并给德国指出沿着和平民主道路发展的方向，用自己的影响来阻止西德政府的军事计划的实现。
    这份照会是由苏联外交部在4日交给英国驻苏联大使馆的。苏联外交部还在同一天把相同内容的两份照会分别交给美、法两国驻苏联的大使馆。
