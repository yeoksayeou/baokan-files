The coal miners of Fuxin Coal Mine, in the mass movement of technological innovation and revolution, successfully created the coal loading machine. Within five days, all coal loading workers in the entire mining area were able to put down the large iron shovels that had been used for generations, realizing the mechanization of coal loading. This is a major reform in China's coal production. Its impact quickly spread throughout the country. In less than two months, the vast majority of key coal mines across the country had also achieved the mechanization of coal loading, liberating coal loading workers on more than eight hundred coal mining faces from heavy physical labor.

Coal loading involves using a shovel to load coal that has fallen after blasting onto an electric conveyor, transporting it out of the coal mining face. This is an important process in coal production, and also an extremely heavy labor process. Achieving the mechanization of coal loading has been a long-held desire of coal miners. However, this desire had not been realized in the past. Until just two months ago, apart from a small number of coal mining faces using combined coal mining machines, blast loading, shearer loading, and hydraulic mining, all other coal mining faces in China still used manual coal loading. According to statistics, in key coal mines across the country, the mechanization rate of the coal falling process was about 97%, the mechanization rate of the coal transportation process was about 92%, but only 20% of the coal loading process used machines. This created a situation where most coal mining faces were like a transportation line with cars at both ends and a section of ox cart in the middle. Manual coal loading in the coal loading process hindered the improvement and development of production on the entire coal mining face. Moreover, manual coal loading was not only inefficient but also involved high labor intensity. A coal loader, bending and straightening up in the mine to shovel coal with an iron shovel, could load several tons of coal per hour. The heaviness of the labor can be imagined. At the same time, manual coal loading caused coal dust to fly, which was harmful to the workers' health.

After the mechanization of coal loading was achieved, the situation was completely different. A "May 9th Chain Coal Loading Machine" operated by two people can load 30 tons of coal per hour. A "Red Flag No. 1 Coal Loading Machine" operated by one person can load 24 tons of coal per hour. In this way, only three to four coal loading machines are needed on a working face to replace all shovels. The number of coal loading workers can be reduced by more than half, and production efficiency can be greatly improved. Taking a working face in the Ping'an Mine of Fuxin as an example, the amount of coal produced per shift increased by 100% compared to manual operation after using the coal loading machine. With improved production efficiency and reduced manpower, the workload of the workers has also been greatly reduced; they only need to master the machine handles. According to a rough estimate, after all working faces in key coal mines across the country achieve the mechanization of coal loading, not only can more raw coal be produced, but also more than 30,000 coal loaders can be reduced and transferred to other production processes. At the same time, the realization of coal loading mechanization means that the three main processes of coal falling, coal loading, and coal transportation on the coal mining face have all been mechanized. This has a great promoting effect on accelerating the advancing speed of the working face, improving roof management, and improving the recovery and reuse rate of pit props.

The superiority of the coal loading machine is very clear. People want to ask, why was the problem of manufacturing coal loading machines, which had not been solved for many years in the past, quickly solved recently in Fuxin Coal Mine? Are the technical equipment conditions of Fuxin Coal Mine particularly good? Fuxin Coal Mine is indeed one of the coal mines in China with better equipment and technical conditions. However, it was precisely this coal mine that had failed to manufacture coal loading machines after numerous experiments in the past few years. Obviously, it was not the technical equipment conditions that played a role in this issue. Then, did they recently obtain any new technical data? No, they did not. There was no new technical data, and even the old ones were lacking, because there had never been coal loading machines before.

Where exactly is the key? It lies in adhering to putting politics in command, launching mass movements, and promoting the communist spirit of daring to think and daring to act. In the past, people had a superstition that coal loading machinery was an unprecedented complex machine that ordinary workers and technicians could not create. However, the Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China disagreed with this view. Their guiding ideology was clear: as long as the masses are armed with the Party's ideology, the communist style of daring to think and act of the vast number of workers is fully utilized, and mass movements are vigorously carried out, coal loading machines can definitely be created. Originally, no new machine in the world comes from the sky. Every tool and machine is created by people in labor practice. Machines have never had innate shapes and specifications. They are only designed based on the objective laws of the production process that people have recognized during production activities. To realize the mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual labor, certain material and technical conditions are certainly needed, but the most important thing is to have the creative spirit to dare to break the existing situation and blaze a new trail. Without people with a communist spirit who dare to break through the shackles of old ideas, old theories, and old patterns, and dare to do things that predecessors have not done or cannot do, there can be no true creation. Creation itself depends on discovering and recognizing the objective things and the laws of their movement. And this is best understood and most clearly recognized by the millions of people who are directly engaged in specific practical activities. Once the masses are mobilized, they can break through the old shackles, create boldly, and never give up until they achieve their goals. The key reason why Fuxin Coal Mine failed to successfully trial-produce coal loading machines in the past few years but quickly succeeded recently is that in the past, only a few people were doing it, while this time, a mass movement was launched. The people who participated in the design, manufacture, testing, and promotion of coal loading machines in Fuxin Coal Mine included electrical and mechanical workers, coal mining workers, tunneling workers, engineers, technicians, and also Party committee secretaries, mine directors, and other grassroots cadres. After mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses, they were able to create miracles that were previously impossible to create. This is the first inspiration that the coal loading machine gives us.

Any newborn thing is often easily overlooked when it is in its infancy. Therefore, discovering new things in a timely manner, vigorously supporting and fostering new things, and overcoming certain weaknesses in the growth process of new things in a timely manner are important prerequisites for promoting the rapid growth and development of new things, and are also the responsibilities of leaders. If we do not discover it, protect it, and pave the way for its growth, alerting people to it, it will not only delay the growth of new things, but may even trample it during its infancy. When the coal loading machine was initially tested, it also had shortcomings such as broken machine handles, damaged machine teeth, and the machine not listening to commands. At that time, some people were discouraged and threw cold water on it. However, the Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China adopted a resolute attitude of support. Once the machine was made, they immediately held on-site meetings and organized coal loading machine technical performance competitions. Through these activities, the newborn coal loading machine took root in people's hearts, while attracting and organizing the broad masses of workers to offer opinions, repeatedly improve it, and promote the coal loading machine to become increasingly perfect. This kind of discovery of new things and immediately grabbing them tightly, unswervingly shouting for them, and never giving up until success is an important guarantee for the rapid success of the coal loading machine. In the current upsurge of technological innovation and revolution, new things are constantly emerging. The emergence of each new thing not only has a great impact on production itself, but also often promotes and drives the emergence of another new thing related to it. This makes it even more necessary for those who are doing leadership work to be good at distinguishing new things and paving the way for their growth. In this way, our technological innovation and revolution movement will inevitably move forward vigorously. This is the second inspiration that the coal loading machine gives us.

The third inspiration that the coal loading machine gives us is: the coal loading machine was created so quickly and promoted so quickly because it started from China's actual situation, started with simplicity, and realized the mechanization and semi-mechanization of the production process from simple to complex, and from low to high. Every new tool or machine is always relatively simple when it first appears. This is because people have a gradual process of understanding objective things. The reason why the newly emerging machines are simple at the beginning reflects that people's understanding of them is still in the initial stage. But understanding will gradually improve. Through continuous practice, people's understanding of it will be further enriched, thus creating the possibility for development from a simple and low-level stage to a complex and advanced stage. This is precisely the inevitable trend of the development of simple and low-level things to complex and advanced things. Recognizing this is very important, and it can prevent the one-sided pursuit of big, heavy, and foreign things in the technological innovation movement without starting from reality. The correct attitude is to use foreign methods when possible, and local methods when necessary, combining local and foreign methods, and moving from local to foreign. Simple machines are easy to manufacture, which is a favorable condition for promotion. It is precisely because the coal loading machine is simple to manufacture and does not require a lot of steel materials, which is very suitable for China's existing material and technical conditions, that it can be manufactured in large quantities, universally promoted, and quickly change the appearance of coal loading faces in the national coal industry, realizing the mechanization of coal loading.

The emergence of the coal loading machine has not only greatly promoted coal production, but also provided a thought-provoking example for the high-speed and comprehensive development of the technological innovation and revolution movement that is currently being carried out across the country. As long as we adhere to putting politics in command, launching mass movements, promoting the communist style of combining daring to think and act with seeking truth from facts, correctly treating new things, and adopting a technical reform policy that starts from reality, the appearance of our production technology will inevitably change rapidly, and the level of production will inevitably increase rapidly, thereby ensuring that we achieve continuous and successive leaps forward.

### 攉煤机给我们的启发

    攉煤机给我们的启发
    阜新煤矿职工在技术革新与技术革命的群众运动中，创造成功了攉煤机，五天之内就使全矿区攉煤工人放下了祖祖辈辈沿用的大铁锹，实现了攉煤机械化。这是我国煤炭生产的一项重大改革。它的影响迅速扩及至全国，不到两个月的时间，全国绝大多数重点煤矿也都实现了攉煤机械化，使八百多个采煤工作面的攉煤工人从笨重的体力劳动中解放出来。
    攉煤，就是用铁锹把爆破后落下的煤炭装上电溜子，运送出采煤工作面去。这是煤炭生产过程中一道重要的工序，也是劳动极为笨重的一道工序。实现攉煤机械化，是煤炭工人长久以来的愿望。但是，这个愿望过去一直没有能够实现。就在两个月以前，我国的煤矿除了少数使用联合采煤机、爆破装煤、截装机装煤和水力采煤的工作面而外，其余的全部工作面都还是用人力手工攉煤。据统计材料，全国重点煤矿矿井中，落煤工序实现机械化的约占97％，运煤工序实现机械化的约占92％，而装煤工序却只有20％使用机器。这就形成了绝大部分的采煤工作面有如一条两端用汽车、中间夹着一段牛车的运输线。装煤工序中的手工攉煤，阻碍着整个采煤工作面生产的提高和发展。而人力手工攉煤，不仅效率低，劳动强度也高。一个攉煤工在井下一躬腰一伸腰地用铁锹攉煤，每小时攉煤几吨，劳动的笨重是可以想见的。同时，手工攉煤时，煤尘飞扬，对工人的健康也有妨害。
    实现攉煤机械化以后，情况就完全不同了。一台两人操纵的“五九链式攉煤机”，每小时可以攉煤三十吨；一台一人操纵的“红旗一号攉煤机”，一小时就可以攉煤二十四吨。这样，一个工作面上，只要有三至四台攉煤机就可以代替全部铁锹，攉煤工人可以减少一半以上，生产效率还可以大大提高。以阜新平安矿的一个工作面为例，使用攉煤机以后，每班出煤量就比手工操作提高了一倍。生产效率提高，人手减少，工人的劳动量也大大减轻，他们只需要掌握机柄就行了。据粗略计算，全国重点煤矿全部工作面实现攉煤机械化以后，不仅可以增产更多的原煤，而且可以减少三万多个攉煤工，充实到其它生产工序上去。同时，攉煤机械化的实现，就使采煤工作面上落煤、攉煤、运煤三道主要工序都实现了机械化。这对加快工作面的推进速度，改善顶板管理，提高坑木回收复用率，都有极大的促进作用。
    攉煤机的优越性是很清楚的。人们要问，为什么过去多年来没有解决的攉煤机制造问题，而最近却在阜新煤矿迅速地解决了呢？是阜新煤矿的技术设备条件特别好吗？阜新煤矿确实是我国设备、技术条件较好的煤矿之一。但是，恰恰正是这个煤矿在过去的几年中，经过无数次试验都没有制造成功攉煤机。显然，在这个问题上起作用的并非技术设备条件。那么，是他们新近得到了什么新的技术资料了吗？也不是。技术资料不仅没有新的，就是旧的也没有。因为过去根本没有过攉煤机。
    诀窍究竟在哪里？就在于坚持政治挂帅和大搞群众运动，发扬敢想、敢干的共产主义风格。过去，人们有一种迷信，认为攉煤机械是一种前所未有的复杂机械，普通工人和技术人员不能创造出来。但是，中共阜新市委不同意这个看法，他们的指导思想是明确的：只要用党的思想武装群众，充分发挥广大职工的敢想敢干共产主义风格，大搞群众运动，就一定能够创造出攉煤机来。本来，世界上任何一部新机械都不是从天而降的，任何一件工具、一部机器都是人在劳动实践中创造出来的。机器也从来不是有着天生的形状和规格的，它只不过是人们在生产活动中认识了生产过程的客观规律，然后根据这种客观过程的规律性，设计出相应的机器来。要实现手工劳动的机械化、半机械化，当然需要一定的物质技术条件，但是首要的是要有敢于打破现有局面、闯出一条新路的创造精神。没有敢于冲破旧思想、旧理论、旧格式的束缚，敢于做前人不曾做或不能做的事的共产主义风格的人，就不可能有真正的创造。创造的本身又依赖于发现和认识客观事物及其运动的规律。而这一点，只有直接从事具体实践活动的千百万群众最了解，认识得最清楚。群众一经发动起来，他们就能够冲破旧的羁绊，大胆创造，不达目的绝不罢休。阜新煤矿在过去几年所以没有能试制成功攉煤机，而最近迅速制造成功，关键的一环就在于以前是少数人干，这次是大搞群众运动。阜新煤矿参加这次攉煤机的设计、制造、试验和推广的，有机电、采煤、掘进工人，有工程师、技术员，也有党委书记、矿长及其它基层干部。广大群众的积极性、创造性调动出来以后，就能够创造出以前所不可能创造的奇迹。这是攉煤机给我们的第一个启发。
    任何一个新生事物，在它萌芽的时候，往往容易被人忽视。因此及时发现新生事物，大力支持、扶植新生事物，及时克服新事物生长过程中的某些弱点，是促进新事物迅速成长、茁壮的重要前提，也是领导者的责任。如果我们不及时发现它，保护它，为它的成长鸣锣开道，引起人们注意，不仅会推迟新事物的成长，甚而会在萌芽期间把它践踏了。攉煤机在初步试验的时候，也出现过机柄断了，机齿坏了，机器不听使唤等缺点。当时也有的人说泄气话，泼冷水。但是，中共阜新市委采取的是坚决支持的态度。机器一旦制成，他们立即召开现场会议，组织攉煤机技术表演赛，通过这些活动，使新生的攉煤机在人们心里扎下根来，同时吸引和组织广大职工群众提意见，反复改进，促进攉煤机日趋完善。这种发现新生事物就立即狠狠抓住，坚定不移地为它大喊大叫，不成功绝不罢休，是攉煤机得以迅速成功的重要保证。在目前风起云涌的技术革新与技术革命运动中，新事物在不断涌现，每一个新的事物的出现，不仅它本身对生产会发生极大的影响，还往往因此促进、带动另一与之相联系的新事物出现。这就更加需要做领导工作的人员，善于辨别新事物，并为它的成长开辟道路。这样，我们的技术革新和技术革命运动，就必然会滚滚向前。这是攉煤机给我们的第二个启发。
    攉煤机给我们的第三个启发是：攉煤机创造得如此迅速、推广得又如此迅速，是由于从我国的实际情况出发，从简易入手，由简到繁，由低到高地实现生产过程的机械化和半机械化。每一种新的工具或机器，在它开始出现的时候，总是比较简单的。这是由于人们对于客观事物的认识有着一个循序渐进的过程。最初出现的新机械所以简单，正反映着人们对它的认识了解还处在初步的阶段。但是认识是会逐步提高的。通过不断的实践，就会进一步丰富人们对它的认识和了解，从而也就为从简单、低级阶段向复杂、高级阶段发展创造了可能性。这正是简单的低级的事物向复杂的、高级的事物发展的必然趋势。认识这一点是很重要的，它可以防止在技术革新运动中不从实际出发，片面地追求大的、重的、洋的等偏向。正确的态度是，能洋则洋，能土则土，土洋结合，由土到洋。简单的机械容易制造，这是便于推广的一个有利条件。攉煤机正是由于它制造简单，需要的钢铁材料不多，很适合于我国现有的物质技术条件，因而也就能够大量地制造，普遍推广，迅速地改变了全国煤炭工业攉煤工作面貌，实现了攉煤机械化。
    攉煤机的出现，不仅对煤炭生产起了巨大的促进作用，而且为目前正在全国开展的技术革新和技术革命运动的高速度的全面的发展，提供了一个发人深思的范例。只要坚持政治挂帅、大搞群众运动，发扬敢想敢干和实事求是相结合的共产主义风格，正确对待新生事物，采取从实际出发的技术改革方针，我们的生产技术面貌必将迅速改观，生产水平必将迅速提高，从而保证我们实现不断的连续的跃进。
