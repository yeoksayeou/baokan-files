	Do a Good Job of Seed Quality Inspection Before Spring Planting
	Agriculture Ministry Seed Management Bureau
	In order to effectively ensure the continued leap forward in agricultural production this year, we must do a good job in the quality inspection of seeds for spring planting. The popular saying among the masses, "Strong mother, fat child," "Good seeds produce good seedlings," illustrates that using good seeds is a prerequisite for ensuring full, uniform, and vigorous seedlings.

	Under the leadership of party and government departments at all levels, the quantity of seeds retained last year in various regions is basically sufficient, and the quality is generally improved compared to previous years. However, the quality of certain seed varieties in some areas is still relatively poor, and coupled with a lack of experience in centralized storage, seed deterioration has occurred. For example, according to a recent general survey by relevant departments in Jiangsu Province, it was discovered that the double-cropping early rice seeds stored in the Weiting Grain Depot in Wuxian County were infested with insects, and tens of thousands of kilograms of the upper layer had lost their value as seeds; the Huangke early rice seeds stored in a warehouse of the Xieqiao Grain Management Office in the same county had greatly reduced germination rates due to heating during storage. It is understood that sweet potatoes in many parts of Shandong Province have recently experienced mold and rot. If these seeds are used for planting, uneven emergence, missing seedlings, and broken ridges will inevitably occur, affecting yield. In addition, impure seed varieties in some areas will also cause uneven growth and development of crops, leading to reduced yields.

	The quality of seeds is not easily discernible from their appearance, so quantity checks alone cannot identify problems. To effectively guarantee seed quality, each batch of seeds must be inspected separately to distinguish their quality, and some necessary processing work should be carried out in conjunction. When inspecting seed quality before spring planting, attention should first be paid to the seed's germination ability (mainly germination rate), followed by whether the variety is pure (containing no or few seeds of different varieties), and whether it is clean (free of impurities); to the extent possible, seeds should also be inspected for certain dangerous pests and diseases. Vegetable seeds are most easily confused or mistaken. For example, some cabbage seeds transferred to Beijing from other places were found to be rapeseed in reality. For these seeds that are not easily identifiable from the seed's appearance, the authenticity of the seeds should also be identified from the morphology of the seedlings after germination and cultivation.

	After understanding the seed quality through inspection, seeds with germination rates, purity, etc., that meet certain requirements or seeds with better quality can be selected for planting. For those with problems, appropriate methods can also be used for treatment. Impure varieties or those containing many impurities can be improved through careful selection and cleaning. Those with pests and diseases can be treated with pesticides and other methods to kill insects and sterilize. For seeds with poor germination rates that must be used for planting, the sowing amount should be appropriately increased to ensure full and uniform seedlings.

	The effect of ensuring and improving seed quality through inspection is extremely significant. Last year, before spring planting, under the guidance of the commune seed station, the Sudian Bayi People's Commune in Changzhi City, Shanxi Province, spent half a month inspecting all 780,000 kilograms of seeds in the entire commune. The quality was relatively good. The 740,000 kilograms of seeds that met the first and second-grade standards were all used for planting, and the rest, which only met the third-grade standards, were reserved as seeds for famine relief. As a result, all 68,000 mu of spring-sown crops in the commune had full and vigorous seedlings. After launching seed inspection work, the emergence rate of peanuts in Jin County, Liaoning Province, rapidly increased from the original general 70%-80% to over 90%.

	Currently, all localities should launch a mass seed quality inspection campaign to ensure that seeds that have not been inspected and do not meet the requirements are not used for planting and do not go into the ground. This is a concrete measure in the agricultural production front before spring planting to implement the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and to carry out the increase production and practice economy movement. Some people may think that this work is technically demanding, and the communes lack both experience and instruments, making it difficult to carry out. This idea is wrong. Many communes have suffered greatly from using bad seeds for planting in the past and are eager to use good seeds for planting. As long as we lead well, their enthusiasm can be greatly developed. Experienced old farmers originally had methods of using small plates and dishes or planting in soil for trial planting (testing germination ability), and they can often distinguish different varieties from the seed's appearance. In terms of tools, many communes in Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia and other provinces (regions) have self-made and created many local instruments for inspection, which are simple in structure and very effective. On this basis and under these favorable conditions, with the concrete guidance and assistance of agricultural technical departments, the technical problem of seed pre-sowing inspection can also be solved among the masses by combining indigenous and foreign methods.

	The key to launching this movement lies in strengthening the Party's leadership. All localities can use various meetings and various propaganda methods to present to the masses the lessons of reduced production due to the use of bad seeds, use examples to illustrate the importance of seed inspection before sowing, and at the same time introduce the specific technical operating methods of seed inspection (cultivating typical examples, organizing visits, running short-term training classes to impart technology, etc.), to quickly launch a seed quality inspection campaign before spring planting.

    春播前要做好种子验质工作
    农业部种子管理局
    为了切实保证今年的农业生产继续跃进，必须做好春种验质工作。群众中流行的“母壮儿肥”、“好种出好苗”的俗语，就说明用好种是保证苗全苗齐苗旺的一个前提。
    在各级党政部门的领导下，各地去年留种的数量，基本够用，质量一般也较往年有所提高。但是也有些地区的某些种子品种质量还比较差，加以集中保管缺少经验，发生了种子变质的情况。如据江苏省有关部门最近普查，发现吴县唯亭粮库保存的双季早稻种生虫，上层的几万斤已失去作种的价值；这个县的斜桥粮管所有一个仓房保存的黄壳早稻种，由于保管期间发热，发芽率大大降低；据了解，山东省最近也有不少地方的甘薯发生霉烂现象。如果用这些种子播种，必然出苗不齐，缺苗断垅，影响产量。另外有些地方的种子品种不纯，用来播种，也会使庄稼生长发育不齐，以致造成减产。
    种子质量的好坏，不容易从种子的表面上看出来，因此只作数量上的检查，是不能发现问题的。为了切实保证种子质量，一定要对每批种子，分别进行检验，鉴别它们的好坏，并结合着进行一些必要的处理工作。在春播前检验种子的质量，首先要注意种子的发芽能力（主要是发芽率），其次是品种是否纯（不含或少含异品种的种子），是否净（干净不含杂质）；在可能范围内，也应该检验种子中是否带有某些危险性的病虫害。蔬菜种子最容易混淆或弄错，例如北京市从外地调入的甘蓝种，有的经查明实际上是油菜籽。对于这些不容易从种子外表上鉴别的种子，还要把种子发芽培养出苗后，从苗的形态等方面去鉴别种子的真实性。
    通过检验，了解种子的质量后，就可以选用发芽率、纯度等都达到一定要求或选用质量比较好的种子播种。对于有问题的，也可以采用适当方法处理。品种不纯或含杂质多的，可通过精选和清理工作提高，对带有病虫害的，可用拌药等方法杀虫灭菌，对发芽率较差而又不得不用来播种的种子，酌量增加播种量，以保证苗全苗齐。
    通过检验，保证和提高种子质量的效果是极其显著的。山西省长治市苏店八一人民公社去年春播前，在公社种子站的指导下，大战半个月，把全公社七十八万斤种子全面进行了检验，质量比较好，合乎第一级、第二级标准的七十四万斤种子全部作种，其余只够三级标准的留作备荒种子，全社六万八千亩春播作物因此亩亩苗全苗壮。辽宁省金县在展开种子检验工作后，花生出苗率由原来一般70％—80％迅速提高到90％以上。
    目前各地应该展开一个群众性的种子验质运动，做到不经检验、不合要求的种子不做种、不下地。这是在春播前的农业生产战线上，贯彻中共中央八届八中全会决议开展增产节约运动中的一项具体措施。也许有人认为这一工作技术性比较强，公社既缺经验、又缺仪器，不好展开。这一想法是不对的。不少公社以往吃了用坏种播种的大亏，很想用好种播种，只要我们领导得好，他们的积极性是可以大大发挥的，有经验的老农，原来就有利用小盘小碟或在泥土里试种（试发芽能力）的办法，他们也常常能从种子的表面上把不同品种区别出来；在工具方面，辽宁、黑龙江、山西、内蒙古等省（区）不少公社自己仿制和创制了不少作检验用的土仪器，它们的构造简单，效能很好。在这些基础上和有利条件下，农业技术部门再加以具体指导帮助，用土洋结合的方法，种子播前检验的技术问题，在群众中也是可以解决的。
    展开这一运动的关键在于加强党的领导。各地可利用各种会议和各种宣传方法，向群众提出用坏种减产的教训，用实例说明种子在播前检验的重要性，同时介绍种子检验的具体技术操作方法（培养典型、组织参观，办短期训练班传授技术等等），迅速展开一个春播前的种子验质运动。
