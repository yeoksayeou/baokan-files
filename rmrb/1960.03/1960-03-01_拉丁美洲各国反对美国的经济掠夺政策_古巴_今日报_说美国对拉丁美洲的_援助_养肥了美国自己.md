Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 26th: The Cuban newspaper "Hoy" published an article today exposing Eisenhower's actions on the eve of his visit and the true nature of US so-called loans and "aid" to Latin America.

The article stated that Eisenhower carefully avoided mentioning the huge profits the United States reaped from its economic "aid" to Latin America. The article pointed out that, according to official US materials, from 1951 to 1957, the United States provided Latin American countries with so-called "non-military aid" amounting to $1,015 million. However, during the same period, the total amount of US dollars flowing from Latin America to the United States reached $2,350 million. This means that for every dollar the United States gave, it took back $1.31 by exploiting Latin American workers and peasants. From 1946 to 1951, US private investors extracted more than $3.50 for every dollar invested. Currently, every dollar invested or loaned by the United States yields more than twice the profit.

Referring to Eisenhower's visit to South America, the newspaper emphasized that the US President would not answer the following major questions raised by Latin America: How to guarantee the stability of Latin American commodity prices in the United States; when will the United States stop buying cheap and selling dear to Latin America, as well as selling industrial equipment needed by Latin America; when will the United States stop obstructing Latin America from trading with socialist markets that provide industrial equipment.

The article finally emphasized that from 1948 to 1958, more than 80% of US "aid" was used for the arms race and militarization of Latin American countries in order to suppress the people of those countries.

The Cuban newspaper "Combate" said in a commentary it published, "Mr. President, we are tired of the ceremonial visits that secretly intend to tighten the encirclement."

Xinhua News Agency, 27th: Rio de Janeiro news: According to reports in the "Brazilian Daily," "Jornal do Commercio," and "Tribuna da Imprensa" on the 26th, Brazilian President Kubitschek and Brazilian officials believe that Eisenhower's remarks in his speech to the Brazilian Congress on the 24th, expressing support for Brazil's proposed Pan-American Action Plan, "are empty." All three newspapers believe that Eisenhower's speech avoided the issue of underdevelopment, which runs counter to Kubitschek's hopes.

According to reports, technical aides to the Governor of São Paulo State, Carvalho Pinto, expressed dissatisfaction with the US policy of suppressing coffee prices and restricting imports during a meeting with Eisenhower's technical aides on the 25th. According to São Paulo state newspapers, Brazilian Minister of Agriculture Jorge de Bonifácio said that the coffee price must be maintained in the United States. He said that due to the decline in coffee prices, Brazil has suffered losses in foreign exchange, and the measures taken by the United States in terms of protectionist tariffs are detrimental to Latin America. He also emphasized that Brazil can only increase cotton exports if the United States does not adopt aggressive dumping policies in the sale of cotton, which is necessary for it to make up for the losses in coffee exports.

Xinhua News Agency, 27th: Rio de Janeiro news: Brazilian public opinion criticized US economic plunder policies in response to Eisenhower's visit.

The São Paulo State Nationalist Front of Brazil sent a telegram to President Eisenhower on the 25th, condemning the harmful actions of US trusts. The telegram stated that US trusts are arbitrarily plundering Brazil, causing Brazilian wealth to flow out continuously, thereby impoverishing the Brazilian people.

The telegram stated that the Brazilian people are determined to fight for the development of Brazil and the safeguarding of Brazil's economic independence. The telegram concluded by expressing the hope that Eisenhower understands that in the struggle for economic liberation and social progress, the people of Latin American countries are inspired by a common ideal, and Cuba's struggle against imperialism is a symbol of this ideal.

National Democratic Union Congressman Gabriel Hermes protested against Eisenhower's speech to the Brazilian Congress on the 24th during his speech in the Rio de Janeiro Chamber of Deputies. Addressing Eisenhower's boasting about US "aid" to Brazil, he said: It is regrettable that Eisenhower actually forgot that hundreds of billions of dollars in profits have already been transferred from Brazil to the United States, and that dollar profits are constantly being transferred to the United States, causing huge losses to the Brazilian economy, the exploitation of Brazilian workers, and the subordinate status of Brazil as an underdeveloped country.

Xinhua News Agency: In recent years, the struggle of the Chilean people against the plunder and control of US monopoly capital has made significant progress. Last year, a wide range of Chilean political parties, trade unions, and people's organizations united to form the National Committee for the Defense of Petroleum, carrying out a massive struggle to defend petroleum resources. Under these circumstances, the Chilean Chamber of Deputies finally rejected by an overwhelming majority in July last year the bill that would have allowed foreign and domestic private capital to develop oil fields in the four northern provinces of Chile, successfully blocking the black hand of US imperialism reaching for Chilean oil resources. Recently, a leading committee of the same scale to defend Chilean ports has been formed to launch a struggle to defeat the conspiracy of US monopoly capital colluding with domestic reactionary forces to allow private capital to infiltrate the port industry, which is crucial to national sovereignty and national industry, under the name of establishing a "National Port Company." In November 1958, some Chilean congressmen proposed a bill to nationalize the country's main resource, copper mines. Subsequently, during committee discussions, the bill was further expanded to include the nationalization of iron mines, nitrate plants, and some of the banking industry.

Although this bill is still in the committee review stage in the parliament, the demand to reclaim national resources has become the unanimous call of Chilean patriots.

For the past year, the so-called "stabilization" economic policy imposed by US imperialism has been the object of struggle for the Chilean people. The Popular Action Front, with the Chilean Communist Party and Socialist Party as its core, the Workers' United Trade Union, and other organizations have successively issued statements condemning this "starvation" policy. Workers in copper mines, coal mines, ports, silk weaving industries, and even medical personnel have successively held large-scale strikes to protest this policy.

Xinhua News Agency, 27th: Buenos Aires news: The Argentine Vegetable Oil Industry Congress sent a letter to US President Eisenhower, who is currently visiting Argentina, protesting the US dumping of linseed oil in Argentina.

The letter said that the US Commodity Credit Corporation recently dumped linseed oil at low prices, causing international price fluctuations in flax and its products, affecting the interests of Argentine producers.

    拉丁美洲各国反对美国的经济掠夺政策
    古巴“今日报”说美国对拉丁美洲的“援助”养肥了美国自己
    据新华社哈瓦那26日电　古巴“今日报”今天发表文章，揭露艾森豪威尔在访问前夕的作为和美国给拉丁美洲的所谓贷款“援助”的真象。
    文章说，艾森豪威尔小心翼翼地不谈美国从对拉丁美洲的经济“援助”中所捞到的巨额利润。文章指出，据美国官方材料，从1951年到1957年，美国给拉丁美洲各国的所谓“非军事援助”达十亿一千五百万美元，但是在同一时期从拉丁美洲流往美国的美元总数达二十三亿五千万美元，这就是说，由于榨取了拉丁美洲的工人和农民，美国的每一美元又带了一点三一美元一起回到美国。从1946年到1951年美国私人投资家通过每一美元的投资榨取了三点五美元以上。目前美国投资或借出的每一美元要得到两倍以上的利润。
    在谈到艾森豪威尔对南美的访问时，这家报纸强调指出，美国总统不会解答拉丁美洲所提出的下列重大问题：如何保证拉丁美洲商品价格在美国的稳定；美国何时才不再对拉丁美洲实行贱买贵卖以及出售拉丁美洲所需要的工业设备；美国何时才会停止阻挠拉丁美洲同向它提供工业设备的社会主义市场做买卖。
    文章最后强调指出，从1948年到1958年，美国“援助”的80％以上都是用于拉丁美洲各国的军备竞赛和军事化以便压迫各国人民。
    古巴“战斗报”在它发表的一篇评论中说，“总统先生，我们对秘密地打算缩小包围圈的礼节性访问已经厌倦了”。
    据新华社27日讯　里约热内卢消息：据“巴西日报”、“新闻报”和“首都人报”26日报道，巴西总统库比契克和巴西官方人士认为：艾森豪威尔24日在巴西国会发表演说中表示支持巴西倡议的泛美行动计划的言论“是空洞的”。这三家报纸都认为，艾森豪威尔的演说，避而不谈不发达状态的问题，这是同库比契克的希望背道而驰的。
    据报道，圣保罗州州长卡瓦略·平托的技术助理人员25日在同艾森豪威尔的技术助理人员举行会谈时，对美国的压低咖啡价格和限制进口的政策表示不满。据圣保罗州各报透露：巴西农业部长若热·博尼法西斯奥说，必须维持在美国的咖啡价格。他说：由于咖啡价格下降，巴西外汇遭受损失，美国在保护关税方面采取的措施对拉丁美洲不利。他还强调指出：只有美国在销售棉花方面不采取咄咄逼人的倾销政策，巴西才能增加棉花的出口，这是它为弥补咖啡出口的损失所必需的。
    据新华社27日讯　里约热内卢消息：巴西舆论就艾森豪威尔的访问抨击美国的经济掠夺政策。
    巴西圣保罗州民族主义阵线25日致电艾森豪威尔，谴责美国托辣斯的有害行动。电文说，美国托辣斯在巴西恣意进行掠夺，使巴西财富源源外流，从而造成巴西人民的贫困化。
    电文表示，巴西人民决意为发展巴西和维护巴西的经济独立而斗争。电文最后说，希望艾森豪威尔懂得，在争取经济解放和社会进步的斗争中，拉丁美洲各国人民是受着一致的理想的鼓舞，而古巴反对帝国主义的斗争正是这种理想的象征。
    全国民主联盟议员加布里埃耳·埃耳梅斯在里约热内卢众院讲话时对艾森豪威尔24日在巴西国会发表的演说提出抗议。他针对艾森豪威尔吹嘘美国对巴西的“援助”这一点说：令人遗憾的是，艾森豪威尔居然忘记了，已经从巴西把数千亿美元的利润输往美国，而且还在不断把美元利润源源输往美国，从而使巴西的经济受到巨大的损失，巴西劳动者受到剥削，而巴西则处于不发达国家的从属地位。
    据新华社讯　智利人民反对美国垄断资本掠夺和控制的斗争，近年来取得了显著的进展。去年，智利政党、工会和人民团体等极广泛阶层团结一致，组成了全国保卫石油委员会，进行声势浩大的保卫石油资源的斗争。在这种情况下，智利众议院终于在去年7月以压倒多数否决了允许外国资本和本国私人资本开发智利北部四省油田的法案，成功地挡住了美帝国主义伸向智利石油资源的黑手。最近，一个具有同样规模的保卫智利港口的领导委员会已经组成，以便展开斗争，击败美国垄断资本勾结本国反动势力以成立“全国港口公司”为名，让私人资本渗入对国家主权和民族工业利害攸关的港口业的阴谋。1958年11月一些智利众议员提出了把国家主要资源铜矿收归国有的法案，随后在委员会讨论中，进一步把法案扩大为把铁矿、硝石厂和部分银行业一起收归国有。
    这个法案目前虽然还停留在议会委员会审议阶段，但是要求收回国家资源已经成为智利爱国人士的一致呼声。
    一年来，美帝国主义所强加的所谓“稳定”经济政策一直是智利人民斗争的对象。以智利共产党和社会党为核心的人民行动阵线、工人统一工会和其他组织都先后发表声明谴责这项“饥饿”政策。铜矿、煤矿、港口、丝织等业职工甚至医务人员都先后举行了大规模的罢工来抗议这项政策。
    新华社27日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：阿根廷植物油工业大会致函正在阿根廷访问的美国总统艾森豪威尔，抗议美国在阿根廷倾销亚麻油。
    信中说，美国商品信贷公司最近曾以低价倾销亚麻油，造成亚麻及其产品的国际价格波动，影响了阿根廷生产者的利益。
