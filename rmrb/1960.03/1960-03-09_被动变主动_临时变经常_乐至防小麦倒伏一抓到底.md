　　Turning Passive into Active, Temporary into Regular
    Lezhi Grasping Wheat Lodging Prevention to the End

　　This report Sichuan Province Lezhi county in wheat field management, according to "From the start prevent lodging, from beginning to end prevent lodging" spirit, the comprehensive measures to prevent lodging runs through every aspect of wheat growth. Now the county's 200,000 acres of wheat is growing well, laying a solid foundation for large-area high yield.

　　In Lezhi County last year, among the 190,000 acres of wheat, only over 1,000 acres experienced lodging. This small amount of lodged wheat was rescued in time, ensuring that wheat production increased by 1.6 times compared to 1958. Among them, over 20,000 acres were high-yield fields, with an average yield of 800 to 1,000 jin per mu. In order to strive for an even greater wheat harvest this year, the county had already summarized experiences at all levels before planting last year, educating the masses to establish the idea that wheat lodging can be overcome. The county party committee systematically organized the masses' various experience measures for preventing lodging, transforming the past passive and temporary methods of preventing wheat lodging into active and high-yield measures.

　　Based on the characteristics of wheat growth, Lezhi County initially implemented comprehensive lodging prevention measures during critical production periods, laying the foundation for healthy wheat growth. In the county’s 200,000 acres of wheat (including 60,000 acres of high-yield fields), measures such as deep plowing, seed selection, fertilization, and close planting were all superior to last year. As a result, this year's wheat roots are well-developed, deeply rooted, long and stable, and the stalks are particularly strong and sturdy. These measures have gained the initiative in preventing wheat lodging.

　　According to the spirit of "30% planting, 70% management," the main measures for preventing wheat lodging generally adopted throughout the county are: ① Skillful topdressing. The county generally adopts a topdressing method combining "small meals frequently" and heavy application of fertilizer at the jointing and booting stages. High-yield fields are topdressed six times, and general fields three or four times, to ensure uniform growth of wheat seedlings and prevent lodging caused by excessive growth. Topdressing is done according to "five observations" (observing seedlings, soil, weather, fertilizer, and seeds), paying attention to the combination of various fertilizers. In the seedling stage, the application of nitrogen and phosphorus is mainly used; after the jointing stage, the application of phosphorus and potassium is mainly used; and in high-yield fields with particularly vigorous growth, the application of nitrogen fertilizer is controlled after the jointing stage; ② Soil cultivation and heaping around the base. From the end of tillering, weathered shale (stone bones) that has been burned, ash, fine sand and soil, chicken and duck manure, etc., are mixed and sprinkled at the base of the wheat to strengthen the roots and prevent lodging. Generally, it is sprinkled once or twice, and high-yield fields four or five times. In addition to strengthening the roots and cultivating the soil, it can also inhibit ineffective tillering, resist drought, conserve water, and improve the soil; ③ For seedlings with a tendency to lodge, a mixed powder of lime and ash is applied to promote the decomposition of potassium fertilizer in the soil, making the stalks strong and sturdy; ④ Bamboo poles are used to drive off dew or rainwater on excessively growing seedlings to reduce the load on the stems and leaves and reduce nutrient absorption. More than 200,000 laborers throughout the county were mobilized to form more than 3,300 wheat field management professional teams. The first secretaries of the district and commune party committees personally lead wheat field management. Currently, wheat field management in the county is mainly focused on large-scale watering, heavy fertilization, and pest control. In the Huilan District, before topdressing, each commune first identifies and ranks the seedlings, and then applies different fertilizers according to the needs of the wheat seedlings, combining fertilization and lodging prevention. Special professional groups are formed for fields with uneven seedling growth to give them separate management, so that they can catch up with strong seedlings in a short period of time. This district also especially strengthens the lodging prevention work for more than 10,000 acres of high-yield wheat fields, sending out strong backbones to establish more than 60 field lodging prevention posts, assigning areas for contracted responsibility, and inserting signs in the fields for regular inspection, managing to the end. Many districts and communes, in order to do a good job in lodging prevention, organized semi-laborers to accumulate grass ash, fertile mud, fine soil, and burn weathered shale powder, etc., for soil cultivation and root strengthening shortly after wheat sowing. Many communes improved tools and manufactured soil cultivation machines, soil spreading machines, etc., which greatly improved work efficiency.

    被动变主动  临时变经常
    乐至防小麦倒伏一抓到底
    本报讯　四川省乐至县在麦田管理中，根据“一开始就防倒，自始至终都防倒”的精神，把防止倒伏的综合措施，贯穿到小麦生长的每一环节。现在全县二十万亩小麦生长得很好，为大面积高产打下牢固的基础。
    乐至县去年十九万亩小麦中，仅有一千多亩发生倒伏现象，而这少数倒伏的小麦也及时得到了挽救，保证了小麦产量比1958年增产一点六倍，其中有两万多亩高产田，平均亩产八百斤到一千斤。为了争取今年小麦更大丰收，全县早在去年播种前就层层总结了经验，教育群众树立小麦倒伏能够战胜的思想。群众防倒伏的各种经验措施，县委还加以系统地整理，把过去防止小麦倒伏的消极被动的临时办法，改变为积极主动的高产措施。
    根据小麦生长的特点，乐至县一开始就在生产关键时期贯彻综合防倒伏的措施，为小麦生长健壮奠定了基础。全县二十万亩小麦，（其中高产田六万亩），深耕、用种、施肥、密植等措施，样样胜过去年，因而今年全县小麦根群发达，扎得深、长得稳，秆茎格外硬壮。这些措施就在防止小麦倒伏工作上取得了主动权。
    根据“三分种、七分管”的精神，全县普遍采用的小麦防倒主要措施是：①巧施追肥。全县普遍采用“少吃多餐”和重施拔节肥、孕穗肥相结合的追肥方法，高产田追肥六次，一般田三、四次，使麦苗生长整齐，防止了因徒长而引起倒伏。追肥作到了“五看”（看苗、看土、看天、看肥、看种），注意各种肥料的配搭施用，苗期以施氮磷为主，拔节开始后以施磷钾为主，生长特别茂盛的高产田，拔节后控制氮肥施用；②培土垒兜。从分蘖末期起，用烧过的风化页岩（石骨子）、草木灰、细沙细土、鸡鸭屎等混合撒在小麦根部，以固根防倒。一般撒一、二次，高产田四、五次，除了固根、培土，还可抑制无效分蘖，抗旱保水和改良土壤；③对有倒伏倾向的麦苗，施用石灰、草木灰混合粉，促进土壤中的钾肥分解，使秆茎硬壮；④用竹竿将过于徒长的麦苗上的露水或雨水赶掉，减轻茎叶负重和减少养分吸收。全县出动劳力二十多万人，组成三千三百多个麦田管理专业队。各区、公社党委第一书记都亲自领导麦田管理。当前全县麦田管理正以大水大肥大治虫为主。回澜区各公社，在追肥前，先对苗架鉴定排队，然后根据麦苗需要情况，分别施用不同肥料，作到施肥、防倒相结合。对苗架生长不整齐的田块，特别组成专业组，给以单独管理，使之在短期内赶上壮苗。这个区还特别加强对一万多亩高产麦田的防倒工作，派出强有力的骨干，建立六十多处田间防倒岗哨，分片包干负责，并在田间插牌，定期检查，一管到底。许多区、公社，为了做好防倒工作，早在小麦播种后不久，便组织半劳动力积造草灰、肥泥、细土和烧制风化页岩粉等，以培土固根。许多公社改进工具，制成培土器、撒土机等，工效大大提高。
