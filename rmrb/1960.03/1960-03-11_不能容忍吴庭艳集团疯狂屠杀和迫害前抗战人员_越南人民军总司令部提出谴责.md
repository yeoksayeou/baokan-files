Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 9th: The Liaison Delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army sent two letters to the International Commission of Vietnam on March 3rd, condemning the Ngo Dinh Diem Group for carrying out large-scale "sweeps" in Ben Tre Province and Quang Ngai Province, massacring and persecuting former resistance personnel and patriotic people.

	In one letter, the Liaison Delegation pointed out that since June of last year, more than 3,000 regular troops of the Ngo Dinh Diem Group, in coordination with armed forces such as commando teams, "Public Security Teams," and "Civil Guard Teams," and under the direct command of Nguyen Van Y, a colonel and commander of the Fifth Military Region of the Ngo Dinh Diem Group, had launched large-scale "sweeps" in Thanh Phu, Me Cay, and other districts in Ben Tre Province, the former anti-resistance base of the Vietnam People's Army.

	The letter stated that in Thanh Phu District, the armed forces of Ngo Dinh Diem not only arrested former resistance personnel and subjected them to extreme torture, but also destroyed and exhumed the graves of Vietnam People's Army martyrs who died during the resistance war, scattering the martyrs' remains.

	The letter stated that the South Vietnamese authorities' troops had launched sweeps for several consecutive months in places such as Cau Mong, Tan Phu, and My Duc. In the six days from January 30 to February 4 this year alone, 180 people were imprisoned and tortured, and 46 people were killed, and almost all of these victims were former resistance personnel.

	The letter stated that, according to incomplete statistics, the Ngo Dinh Diem Group had arrested a total of 1,352 former resistance personnel, bombed and killed 183 people, wounded 130 people, imprisoned more than 3,000 people in concentration camps, and burned and plundered thousands of tons of grain and other property from the people in the "sweeps" in Ben Tre Province.

	On the same day, the Liaison Delegation of the Vietnam People's Army, in another letter to the International Commission of Vietnam, protested the South Vietnamese authorities' atrocities in the former anti-Japanese resistance base in Quang Ngai Province. The letter stated that in the various "sweeps" carried out by the South Vietnamese authorities in this province in the second half of last year alone, more than 400 former resistance personnel were arrested, of whom 130 have been killed.

	In the above two letters, the Liaison Delegation of the Vietnam People's Army solemnly pointed out that these atrocities of the South Vietnamese authorities not only violate Article 14, paragraph C of the Geneva Accords, but also seriously infringe upon the basic human rights of the people.

	In the letters, the People's Army Liaison Delegation requested that the International Commission immediately conduct on-site investigations into the aforementioned illegal events, and compel the South Vietnamese authorities to immediately stop the "sweeps" of the people in Ben Tre Province and Quang Ngai Province, stop the economic blockade of the mountain people in Quang Ngai Province, dissolve all "agglomeration zones," immediately restore the freedom of the aforementioned arrested former resistance personnel, and guarantee their democratic freedoms, and at the same time provide compensation to the affected families.

    不能容忍吴庭艳集团疯狂屠杀和迫害前抗战人员
    越南人民军总司令部提出谴责
    据新华社河内9日电　越南人民军总司令部联络代表团3日给越南国际委员会两封信，谴责吴庭艳集团在槟椥省和广义省进行大规模的“扫荡”，屠杀和迫害前抗战人员与爱国人民。
    联络代表团在一封信里指出，从去年6月起，吴庭艳集团的正规军三千多人在别动队、“公安队”、“民卫队”等武装力量的配合下，由吴庭艳集团第五军区司令阮文衣大校直接指挥，在槟椥省越南人民军前抗战根据地清富、楳棋等县展开大规模的“扫荡”。
    信中说，吴庭艳的武装力量在清富县各地除了逮捕了前抗战人员并施以极刑外，还破坏和挖掘在抗战期间牺牲的越南人民军烈士的坟墓，乱抛烈士们的骸骨。
    信中说，南越当局的军队曾在桥蒙、新富、美德等地展开了连续几个月的扫荡。仅在今年1月30日到2月4日六天中，就有一百八十人被监禁拷打，四十六人被杀害，而这些受害者几乎都是前抗战人员。
    信中说，据不完全统计，吴庭艳集团在槟椥省的“扫荡”中先后共逮捕了一千三百五十二名前抗战人员，炸死一百八十三人，打伤一百三十人，三千多人被关进集中营，烧毁和掠劫人民成千吨粮食和其他财产。
    同日，越南人民军联络代表团在另一封给越南国际委员会的信中抗议南越当局在广义省前抗日根据地的暴行。信中说，仅在去年下半年，南越当局在这个省的历次“扫荡”中逮捕了四百多名前抗战人员，其中一百三十人已被杀害。
    越南人民军联络代表团在上述两封信中严正指出，南越当局的这些暴行不仅违反了日内瓦协议第十四条丙款，而且严重地侵犯了人民的基本人权。
    人民军联络代表团在信中要求国际委员会立即就上述违法事件到现场进行调查，并迫使南越当局马上停止对槟椥省和广义省人民的“扫荡”，停止对广义省的山区人民实行经济封锁，解散所有“稠密区”，马上恢复上述被捕的前抗战人员的自由，并且保障他们的民主自由权，同时对受害的家庭给予赔偿。
