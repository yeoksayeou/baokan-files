Xinhua News Agency, March 6th, Moscow Dispatch from TASS: The working people of Moscow held a mass rally at the Lenin Central Stadium on the 5th to welcome Soviet Minister Chairman Khrushchev upon his return from his visit to Asian countries.

In the gymnasium hall, representatives of workers from various industrial enterprises and construction sites in Moscow, scientists, people from cultural and artistic circles, various social organizations, and youth gathered. Leaders of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government also attended the meeting.

Ustinov, First Secretary of the Moscow City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, worker Sadikov, female collective farm member Sisoyeva, engineer Lyulichenko, and others spoke at the meeting, congratulating Khrushchev.

Subsequently, Soviet Minister Chairman Khrushchev delivered a lengthy speech at the mass rally.

In his speech, Khrushchev discussed his visits to Indonesia, India, Burma, and Afghanistan. This visit was extremely beneficial. He said that the imperialists' attempt to frighten the people of all countries with the so-called "communist threat" and to obstruct the development of friendship and cooperation between the young independent countries of the East and the socialist countries is a futile effort. He said that the people of the East have seen from their own experience that the socialist countries have no selfish motives, that they are truly willing to help and are helping all those countries that have embarked on the path of independent development.

Khrushchev emphasized that the era of colonialism, which is cursed by mankind, is passing away. However, the colonialists are trying their best to prolong their rule. Therefore, the people of all countries who have shaken off the shackles of colonialism should remain vigilant.

Khrushchev also spoke about the upcoming talks with the leaders of Western countries in his speech. He said that the Soviet side has always done everything possible to create favorable conditions for future negotiations. If the West participates in the talks with the same desire, then it can be expected that the summit meeting will be successful. Khrushchev expressed the hope that Western countries would not create new difficulties for future talks. Xinhua News Agency, March 5th, Moscow Dispatch from TASS: Speaking at a mass rally of working people in Moscow on the 5th, Soviet Minister Chairman Khrushchev conveyed to the Soviet people the heartfelt respect and best wishes of national activists and the broad public in India, Burma, Indonesia, and Afghanistan.

Khrushchev said that in the countries he visited, the great role played by the Soviet state and the heroic Soviet people in the struggle for human freedom and happiness, and in the struggle for peace, was highly praised.

Khrushchev said that in our era, even the most stubborn defenders of capitalism admit that the Soviet Union is advancing by leaps and bounds, catching up with, and in many respects surpassing, the most developed capitalist country in the world—the United States.

Khrushchev, referring to a recent report by the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, "U.S. Foreign Policy Towards the Soviet Union and Eastern European Countries" (which openly acknowledged the Soviet Union's brilliant achievements), said that the Soviet Union's achievements have plunged thinkers and politicians in the capitalist world into a state of panic.

He said that what frightens them is that in the near future, the Soviet Union will undoubtedly catch up with and surpass the United States in terms of economic development; thus, with the growth of the Soviet Union's economic power, the scale of Soviet assistance to countries that were formerly colonies and dependencies will undoubtedly increase immeasurably; this will also enable the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are fighting for their national independence to see the Soviet Union as an example of how to transform from backwardness to advancement in a short period.

Khrushchev emphasized that the imperialists' attempt to frighten the people of all countries with the "danger of communism" and to obstruct the development of friendship and cooperation between the young independent countries of the East and the socialist countries is a waste of effort.

Khrushchev said that the people of the East have seen from their own experience that the socialist countries have no selfish purposes, and that they are truly willing to help and are helping all those countries that have embarked on the path of independent development and are consolidating their national systems.

Khrushchev said that the most important thing for the people of the East in their struggle to consolidate their independence is to develop their national economies, first and foremost to establish their own industries. At this time, the further expansion of equal and mutually beneficial economic cooperation between socialist countries and Asian, African, and Latin American countries is one of the decisive conditions for transforming formerly backward colonial countries into advanced, industrialized countries.

Khrushchev stressed that no matter how the colonialists and monopoly capital oppose this progressive process, they have no way to turn back the wheels of history and restore the corrupt colonial system.

The head of the Soviet government said that the people of the East have taken the first steps on the road to independent development and tasted the first fruits of life without foreign oppressors, "therefore, they will never allow the shackles of colonialism to be imposed on them again."

He emphasized that the people of the East are not isolated in their struggle against imperialist colonialists, because they know that they have many loyal and powerful friends—the people of socialist countries and the progressive forces of the world.

Khrushchev spoke about his twelve-day visit to Indonesia, saying that the warm and friendly welcome he received in that country vividly demonstrated the unbreakable friendship between the Soviet and Indonesian peoples.

When talking about helping Indonesia develop its economy, Khrushchev made special mention of the Soviet-Indonesian economic and technical cooperation agreement signed during his visit. He pointed out that the Soviet Union's assistance was highly valued by the Indonesian people and its government. This assistance clearly embodies the Marxist-Leninist principles of internationalism adhered to by the Soviet people.

Khrushchev said that, figuratively speaking, the Soviet Union's assistance is a source of clear spring water for the people of all countries who have freed themselves from colonial enslavement.

He said that when these people receive selfless help, they will never forget it, just as travelers will never forget a refreshing spring. And this spring will never dry up, just as the will, energy, and intellect of mankind yearning for a better future will never dry up.

Khrushchev said that the people of the East are now firmly telling the colonialists that the shameful era of colonialism is coming to an end. New things are arriving by leaps and bounds, and these new things are moving forward heroically.

Khrushchev said: "The days are not far off when the representatives of the capitalist world will be even more amazed and shocked. Now, they are finally beginning to understand the great significance of the new era opened up by the October Revolution under the leadership of Lenin. Now, more than one billion people in socialist countries are building a new life. The people of the East have stood up and are taking action, demanding their rights. They are throwing off the shackles of colonialism, stretching their strong arms, and developing the capabilities and potential of their countries."

The wonders that people can create when they throw off foreign oppression, achieve political independence, build their own countries, and develop their own economies have repeatedly astonished the colonialists.

Khrushchev said that history has passed judgment on colonialism. The era of colonialism, which is cursed by mankind, is passing away. However, like all old, decadent, and despicable things, colonialism will not withdraw from life without cunning struggles and despicable acts. The roots of colonialism have been pulled out, but there are still remnants of colonialism in some places.

Khrushchev emphasized that the colonialists are trying their best to prolong their rule. Therefore, the people of all countries who have shaken off the shackles of colonialism should remain vigilant. He said that the guarantee of their victory lies in achieving economic independence. Economic independence will further consolidate political independence.

Khrushchev expressed great satisfaction with the fact that the talks with President Sukarno and other Indonesian activists confirmed Indonesia's policy of not participating in military blocs and condemning colonialism.

Khrushchev said that we are particularly pleased to note that our positions coincide on all major international issues in the struggle for peace and against colonialism.

Khrushchev said that we are extremely pleased with President Sukarno's and Indonesian First Minister Djuanda's statement that Indonesia supports the Soviet government's proposal for complete and thorough disarmament.

Khrushchev said that President Sukarno and Indonesian First Minister Djuanda's visit to the Soviet Union will help further strengthen the friendly relations between the two countries.

Speaking about his visit to India, Khrushchev said that, in his opinion, the lengthy talks with Prime Minister Nehru promoted better mutual understanding and further strengthened the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and India.

Khrushchev said that Bhilai is building a huge industrial center in India.

Khrushchev mentioned that India will build a series of new enterprises, and Soviet engineers, technicians, and workers will actively participate in the construction of these enterprises. In addition to the previously granted loans, the Soviet Union has given India a new loan of 1.5 billion rubles.

Khrushchev said that my talks with Mr. Nehru in Calcutta once again proved that the Soviet government's foreign policy, our struggle for peace and friendship among all peoples, has received due understanding in India, just as we treat the peaceful policy of the Republic of India with respect.

The Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers expressed satisfaction that Nehru agreed to visit the Soviet Union.

Khrushchev continued, the two days spent in Burma, in my opinion, are of great benefit to the further development of Soviet-Burmese relations. Khrushchev believes that his talks with Burmese President U Win Maung were beneficial. He also said that the talks with Burmese Prime Minister General Ne Win left a good impression.

The head of the Soviet government said that we parted with Rangoon with sincere satisfaction, because we once again saw with our own eyes that the relations between the Soviet Union and Burma are on the right track. We have a common line on the basic issues of the struggle for peace and the struggle against colonialism. Our goals coincide.

Khrushchev then said that he had conducted mutually beneficial talks with King Mohammed Zahir Shah, Prime Minister Daud, and other national leaders in Afghanistan. He said that these talks, conducted in a spirit of mutual understanding and sincerity, will help further strengthen the friendly cooperation between our two peoples and help consolidate peace in the Middle East.

Khrushchev said, "We did not have any disagreements in our assessment of the international situation." He said that our peaceful foreign policy has been understood by the King of Afghanistan, just as Afghanistan's policy of neutrality and non-participation in military blocs is understood and respected by us.

The head of the Soviet government said that Afghanistan can always count on the friendly support of the Soviet Union in its struggle to consolidate and unite national forces and to develop its economy and culture.

Referring to the issue of Pashtunistan, which is of concern to Afghanistan, Khrushchev emphasized that the Soviet Union believes that Afghanistan's demands are correct, namely, to provide the Pashtun people with the opportunity to decide through a plebiscite, through a referendum held under free conditions, whether they are willing to remain within the territory of Pakistan, or whether they are willing to establish a new independent state, or whether they are willing to merge with Afghanistan.

Khrushchev reiterated that the Soviet Union's assistance to the people of all countries who have freed themselves from colonial enslavement is completely selfless, and that the Soviet Union sincerely hopes that the people of these countries will overcome economic backwardness. Once these countries are consolidated, they will be able to more forcefully defend the great cause of peace.

The head of the Soviet government emphasized that the visits to India, Burma, Indonesia, and Afghanistan once again demonstrated the growing and strengthening friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and the peoples of the East, based on peaceful coexistence, and demonstrated the common determination to further ease international tensions and to struggle for the consolidation of peace.

Khrushchev said that there will be some major talks in the future. First, talks with the French national leader, President de Gaulle, and later talks with the national leaders of the United States, Britain, and France.

Khrushchev emphasized that the Soviet Union is participating in these talks with full sincerity, prepared to seek ways to further ease international tensions and peacefully resolve disputes together with other countries. Khrushchev said that we have always done everything possible in the past and present to create favorable conditions for these future negotiations. We intend to make the future talks successful. If our Western partners participate in the talks with the same desire, then it can be expected that the summit meeting will be successful.

Khrushchev said that the task now is to prevent any country from complicating the situation with this or that action. We hope that if Western countries sincerely hope to achieve success, they will not create new difficulties and will make their own contribution to achieving satisfactory results in future talks.

    赫鲁晓夫在莫斯科群众大会上讲话
    谈对亚洲四个国家的访问
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：莫斯科劳动人民5日在列宁中央运动场举行群众大会，欢迎苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫从亚洲国家访问归来。
    在体育馆大厅里，聚集了莫斯科各工业企业和建筑工地的工人、科学家、文化艺术界人士、各社会团体和青年的代表。出席大会的还有苏联共产党和苏联政府的领导人。
    苏联共产党莫斯科市委员会第一书记乌斯季诺夫、工人萨季科夫、集体农庄女庄员西索耶娃、工程师柳利钦科等人在大会上讲了话，向赫鲁晓夫表示祝贺。
    接着，苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在群众大会上发表了长篇演说。
    赫鲁晓夫在演说中谈到了他在印度尼西亚、印度、缅甸和阿富汗访问的经过。这次访问是极其有益的。他说，帝国主义者企图用所谓“共产主义威胁”吓唬各国人民，企图阻挠东方年轻的独立国家和社会主义国家的友谊和合作的发展，这是白费力气的。他说，东方各国人民根据自己的亲身经验看到各社会主义国家并没有任何自私的目的，它们是真正愿意帮助、而且也正在帮助所有那些走上独立发展道路的国家。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，为人类所诅咒的殖民主义时代正在消逝。但是，殖民主义者企图千方百计地延长自己的统治。因此，摆脱了殖民主义枷锁的各国人民应当保持警惕。
    赫鲁晓夫在演说中还谈到了即将同西方国家领导人举行的会谈。他说，苏联方面过去和现在一直是尽一切可能来为将来的谈判创造有利条件。如果西方也抱着同样的愿望参加会谈，那么是可以期待政府首脑会谈获得成功的。赫鲁晓夫表示希望，西方国家不要为将来的会谈制造新的困难。新华社6日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科5日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫5日在莫斯科劳动群众大会上讲话时，向苏联人民转达了印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚和阿富汗国家活动家和广大公众的衷心敬意和良好的祝愿。
    赫鲁晓夫谈到，在他访问的国家，苏维埃国家和苏联英雄的人民在争取人类自由和幸福的斗争中、在争取和平的斗争中所起的伟大作用受到了很高的赞扬。
    赫鲁晓夫说，在我们的时代里，即令是最顽固的资本主义维护者也承认，苏联正在大踏步地前进，正在赶上、而且在许多方面已经超过了世界上最发达的资本主义国家——美国。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到美国参议院外交委员会不久前所发表的一项报告“美国对苏联和东欧国家的外交政策”（这一报告公开承认了苏联的辉煌成就）时说，苏联的成就使资本主义世界的思想家和政治家们陷入了惊惶失措的状态。
    他说，使他们惊惶的是，在不久的将来，苏联在经济发展水平方面无疑将赶上并超过美国；这样，随着苏联经济威力的增长，苏联对从前曾经是殖民地和附属国的国家的援助规模必将无比地增加；这样也将会使亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲正在争取本国独立的各国人民看到苏联是在短期内由落后变为先进的榜样。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，帝国主义者企图用“共产主义的危险”来吓唬各国人民，企图阻挠东方年轻的独立国家同社会主义国家的友谊和合作的发展，这是白费气力。
    赫鲁晓夫说，东方各国人民根据自己的亲身经验看到，各社会主义国家并没有任何自私的目的，它们是真正愿意帮助、而且也正在帮助所有那些走上了独立发展并巩固自己的国家制度道路的国家。
    赫鲁晓夫说，现在东方各国人民在为巩固独立而进行的斗争中最主要的是发展民族经济，首先是建立本国工业。在这个时候，社会主义国家同亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家进一步扩大平等互利的经济合作，是把过去落后的殖民地国家变成先进的工业发达国家的决定性条件之一。
    赫鲁晓夫着重说，无论殖民主义者和垄断资本怎样反对这个进步过程，他们没有办法使历史车轮倒退，使腐朽的殖民制度复辟。
    苏联政府首脑说，东方人民在独立发展的道路上迈出了头几步，尝到了没有外国压迫者过问的生活的头一批果实，“因此决不会再让殖民主义枷锁强加在自己的身上了。”
    他着重说，东方人民在反对帝国主义殖民主义者的斗争中不是孤立的，因为他们知道，他们有许多忠实和强大的朋友——社会主义国家的人民和全世界的进步力量。
    赫鲁晓夫谈到在印度尼西亚为时十二天的访问时说道，在这个国家所受到的热情友好的欢迎生动地显示了苏联和印度尼西亚人民的牢不可破的友谊。
    在谈到帮助印度尼西亚发展经济的时候，赫鲁晓夫特别提到他在访问期间所签定的苏联—印度尼西亚经济技术合作协定。他指出，苏联的帮助得到印度尼西亚人民及其政府的极高的评价。这种帮助明显地体现了苏联人民所奉行的马克思列宁主义国际主义原则。
    赫鲁晓夫说，形象地说，苏联的援助是摆脱殖民主义奴役的各国人民获得清泉的水源。
    他说，这些人民得到无私的帮助时，将永远不会忘记这种帮助，正好像旅行的人不会忘记解渴的清泉一样。而这种泉水是永不枯竭的，正好像向往美好未来的人类的意志、精力和理智永不枯竭一样。
    赫鲁晓夫说，东方人民现在坚决地对殖民主义者说，可耻的殖民主义时代就要结束。新生事物大踏步而来，这种新生事物豪迈地前进着。
    赫鲁晓夫说：“资本主义世界的代表将更加惊异和震动的日子已为期不远了。现在，他们终于开始理解到在列宁领导下所完成的十月革命所开创的新时代的伟大意义。现在，社会主义国家十亿以上的人民正在建设着新生活。东方的人民站立起来了，行动起来了，他们要求着自己的权利。他们甩掉殖民主义的枷锁，舒展着自己粗壮的臂膀，发挥着自己国家的能力和潜在力。”
    当人民摆脱外国的压迫，获得政治独立，建设自己的国家，发展自己的经济和文化的时候，他们能够创造出怎样的奇迹，这不止一次地使殖民主义者瞠目结舌，感到惊奇。
    赫鲁晓夫说，历史给殖民主义作出了判决。为人类所诅咒的殖民主义时代正在消逝。但是，像一切旧的、衰老的、卑恶的事物一样，殖民主义不会没有狡猾的挣扎、不会没有卑鄙行为就退出生活。殖民主义的根子已经拔掉了，但是，在某些地方还有殖民主义的残余。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，殖民主义者企图千方百计地延长自己的统治。因此，摆脱了殖民主义枷锁的各国人民应当保持警惕。他说，他们胜利的保证在于取得经济独立。经济上的独立也将进一步巩固政治独立。
    赫鲁晓夫对这样一点表示极为满意：由于同苏加诺总统和其他印度尼西亚活动家的会谈的结果，证实了印度尼西亚不参加军事集团的政策、谴责殖民主义的政策。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们特别愉快地指出，在争取和平、反对殖民主义斗争中的一切主要国际问题上，我们的立场是吻合的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们对苏加诺总统和印度尼西亚政府关于印度尼西亚支持苏联政府全面彻底裁军建议的声明，表示极为满意。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏加诺总统和印度尼西亚政府第一部长朱安达将来到苏联的访问，将有助于进一步加强两国之间的友好关系。
    赫鲁晓夫谈到访问印度的情况时说，据他看，同尼赫鲁总理进行的长时间会谈促成了相互间的更好的谅解，并且更加加强了苏联和印度的友好关系。
    赫鲁晓夫说，比莱在建设一个印度巨大的工业中心。
    赫鲁晓夫提到，印度将建设一系列新企业，苏联工程师、技术员和工人将积极参加这些企业的建设。除了原先给予的贷款以外，苏联又给了印度十五亿卢布的新贷款。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我同尼赫鲁先生在加尔各答进行的会谈再一次证明了，苏联政府的外交方针，我们争取和平和各国人民友谊的斗争，在印度受到了应有的理解，正像我们怀着尊敬的心情对待印度共和国的和平政策一样。
    苏联部长会议主席对尼赫鲁同意访问苏联表示满意。
    赫鲁晓夫继续说，在缅甸逗留的两天，据我看，对苏缅关系的进一步发展是有很大好处的。赫鲁晓夫认为，他同缅甸联邦总统吴温貌进行的会谈是有益的。他还说，同缅甸总理奈温将军的会谈留下了良好的印象。
    苏联政府首脑说，我们是怀着真诚满意的心情同仰光告别的。因为我们再一次亲眼看到了，苏联和缅甸的关系处在正确的道路上。在争取和平的斗争和反对殖民主义的斗争的基本问题上我们有共同的路线。我们的目标是吻合的。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，在阿富汗同穆罕默德·查希尔·沙阿国王、达乌德首相和其他国家领导人进行了对两国都很有好处的会谈，他说，这些本着互相谅解和诚恳的精神进行的会谈，将有助于进一步加强我们两国人民的友好合作，有助于巩固中近东的和平。
    赫鲁晓夫说：“我们在对国际局势的估计上，没有发生任何分歧”。他说，我们的和平外交政策得到了阿富汗国王的理解，正好像阿富汗中立和不参加军事集团的政策得到我们的理解和尊重一样。
    苏联政府首脑说，阿富汗在它为巩固和团结民族力量、为发展经济和文化而进行的斗争中可以永远指望得到苏联的友好支持。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到阿富汗所关心的普什图尼斯坦的问题时强调指出，苏联认为阿富汗的要求是正确的，即要求给普什图民族提供机会，让他们通过民意测验、通过在自由条件下举行的公民投票来决定：他们是愿意留在巴基斯坦国家的版图内，还是愿意成立新的独立的国家，或者是愿意同阿富汗合并。
    赫鲁晓夫再次提到，苏联帮助所有摆脱了殖民主义奴役的国家的人民完全是无私的，苏联真诚地希望这些国家的人民克服经济落后状态。这些国家巩固以后，将能更有力地捍卫伟大的和平事业。
    苏联政府首脑着重指出，对印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚和阿富汗的访问又一次显示了苏联各族人民同东方各国人民的以和平共处为基础的日益增长和加强的友谊，显示了共同为进一步缓和国际紧张局势、为巩固和平而斗争的决心。
    赫鲁晓夫说，将来将有一些重大的会谈。首先是同法国国家领导人、同戴高乐总统的会谈，稍后将同美国、英国和法国的国家领导人的会谈。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，苏联参加这些会谈，是抱着充分的诚意准备同其他国家一道寻求进一步缓和国际紧张局势、和平解决争端的道路。赫鲁晓夫说，我们方面过去和现在一向是尽一切可能来为将来的这些谈判创造有利的条件。我们打算使将来的会谈取得成就。如果我们西方的伙伴也抱着同样的愿望参加会谈，那么，是可以期待政府首脑会谈获得成功的。
    赫鲁晓夫说，现在的任务是使任何一个国家都不以这种或那种行动使局势复杂化。我们希望，如果西方国家真诚希望获得成功，就将不会制造新的困难，就将会为在将来的会谈上取得圆满的结果作出自己的贡献。
