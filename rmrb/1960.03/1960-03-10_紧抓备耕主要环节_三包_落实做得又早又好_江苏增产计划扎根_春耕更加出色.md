(Our Nanjing Dispatch, March 9th) Jiangsu is conducting "three guarantees"—guaranteed workload, guaranteed output, and guaranteed cost—in all-round way amidst the upsurge of spring plowing. By the end of February, 97% of the "three guarantees" had already been implemented at the team level or were in the process of implementation. It is expected that the entire province will complete the "three guarantees" work before spring sowing.

The first characteristic of Jiangsu's "three guarantees" work this year is that it was grasped early. The "three guarantees" for summer crops were completed during the autumn planting last year; the "three guarantees" for spring and summer crops were fully implemented in early February, more than a month earlier than in previous years. In previous years, some areas were late in grasping the "three guarantees" work, and production plans and crop layouts were not implemented. Therefore, a few production teams experienced phenomena such as untimely measures, incomplete arrangements, or insufficient planting areas for grain and cotton. In order to change this situation, on the basis of fully mobilizing the masses to discuss and formulate the 1960 production plan, the work of guaranteeing output, guaranteeing workload, and guaranteeing cost was done in a timely manner, so that the cadres and masses of each production team (output guarantee unit) had a clear understanding of this year's production plan, crop layout, technical measures, labor arrangements, and the addition and repair of agricultural tools at an early date, and carried out the preparation work more systematically. For example, the Nantong Special District, through the "three guarantees" work, achieved four matches: planned planting area, stubble, variety, and seedling nursery bed. The Yangzhou Special District, in the "three guarantees" work, mobilized the masses to speak out and debate, and formulated this year's great leap forward targets for each item and each field, and put up signs in the fields. After the output targets were determined, a set of technical measures to achieve high-yield targets was determined based on the high-yield experience of the region. In the spirit of exceeding what can be produced, the "three guarantees" were properly implemented, so that the production increase targets and measures were truly implemented and rooted in the minds of the masses. The Suzhou Special District, in the "three guarantees" work, deeply mobilized the cadres and members of the communes and teams to boost their energy, find key points, and tap potential, and discussed the output guarantee targets. Finally, it was determined that the average yield per mu of the three wheat crops in the special district this year would be 334 jin, and the rice output guarantee target would be 900 jin. Because the "three guarantees" work was grasped early in various places, the production enthusiasm of the masses was even higher, and the material preparation for spring plowing and spring planting was done even better. At present, 3 billion dan of basal fertilizer for spring-sown crops have been accumulated in the province, an average of 91 dan per mu, an increase of 1.6 times compared with the same period last year. More and better spring sowing seeds were also retained than last year. The seed selection work was done more carefully. Taking Yancheng Special District as an example, there were more than 26 million jin of grain-selected and fumigated cotton seeds, a significant increase over last year. The masses' response to this year's "three guarantees" work is: "The 'three guarantees' are grasped early, and there is a goal for the great leap forward in production."

The second characteristic of the province's "three guarantees" work is that it is grasped in detail and in an all-round way. The "three guarantees" work in various places is carried out in conjunction with socialist education. The general practice is to first explain the excellent situation of the continued great leap forward in production this year to the cadres and members, and then mobilize the masses to speak out and debate, so that the members realize the favorable conditions for the continued great leap forward in production this year, and the benefits of realizing "three guarantees and one reward" last year. After the ideological understanding is improved, the specific study of the "three guarantees" plan is carried out. In many areas, the "three guarantees" work specifically studied the new situations and new characteristics of the "three guarantees" work this year: (1) After communization, the overall production made a great leap forward, and agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries all had to be guaranteed; (2) Production conditions have changed, and there has been great development in water conservancy construction, soil improvement, and the degree of mechanization; (3) The field management work in 1960 should be generally raised to a more advanced level. Carrying out the "three guarantees" according to these situations and characteristics can be more reasonable and conducive to unity between production teams. In the mobilization of the masses to discuss the "three guarantees" in Shuyang County, Huaiyin Special District, a detailed study was made on the changes in the current production conditions. The output guarantee targets set according to the new situation are more reasonable and more advanced. In some places where conditions have changed, the output guarantee targets this year have increased by about one time compared with last year. For example, the total grain output guaranteed by the Daxing Production Brigade of the Liuji People's Commune in 1959 was 1.08 million jin. Because the water conservancy conditions are better than before and the soil improvement work is done well, the total grain output guaranteed this year is 2.08 million jin. Last year, the Songhe Brigade of Zhaxia Commune guaranteed nine working days per mu for the three wheat crops. This year, the standards for field management are higher, and the guaranteed workload per mu has increased to thirteen working days. Last year, the guaranteed workload per mu for spring-sown corn was thirteen working days, and this year it has increased to seventeen working days per mu. All localities pay attention to adhering to the principle of diligence and thrift in running the communes in the guarantee of costs. For example, in the past, the Huji Commune needed to buy more than 21,000 yuan of commercial fertilizer every year. Although the amount of fertilizer applied by this commune is planned to increase significantly this year, the cost guarantee figure has not increased because the pig-raising industry has been developed and natural fertilizers and native fertilizers have been vigorously developed to meet the requirement of 100 dan of fertilizer per mu for spring sowing. As a result, the members are very satisfied. There are also no opinions between the teams. After the "three guarantees," the labor attendance rate has generally increased.

A new upsurge in production is currently emerging in Jiangsu Province. According to statistics at the end of February, more than 35 million mu of the three wheat crops in the province were top-dressed with returning green fertilizer, accounting for 89% of the planting area, an increase of 79.8% compared with the same period last year. Under the impetus of the call of "Northern Jiangsu catching up with Southern Jiangsu, Southern Jiangsu producing even higher yields," spring sowing preparation work has been greatly advanced. The characteristics are early start, comprehensive grasp, large scale, and high standards, and the spirit of expanding spring sowing area and achieving high yields and more harvests has been basically implemented.

    紧抓备耕主要环节——“三包”落实做得又早又好
    江苏增产计划扎根　春耕更加出色
    本报南京9日电　江苏在春耕高潮中，全面进行包工、包产、包成本的“三包”工作。到2月底为止，“三包”已经落实到队和正在落实的已达97％，预计全省在春播之前，可以全部完成“三包”工作。
    江苏今年“三包”工作的第一个特点是抓得早。夏熟作物的
  “三包”，在去年秋种的时候就做好了；春种和夏种作物的“三包”，在2月上旬就全面推行了，比往年提早一个多月。往年有些地区“三包”工作抓得迟，生产计划、作物布局未能落实，因此，少数生产队发生了措施不及时、安排不全面或是粮、棉播种面积不足的现象。为了改变这种情况，各地在充分发动群众讨论和制定1960年生产规划的基础上，及时做好了包产、包工、包成本的工作，使得每个生产队（包产单位）的干部和群众，对今年的生产计划、作物布局、技术措施、劳力安排、农具添置和修理等工作，早日心中有数，更加有计划地进行备耕工作。例如南通专区通过“三包”工作，做到计划播种面积、茬口、品种、秧田苗床四对头。扬州专区在“三包”工作中，发动群众鸣放辩论，分项分田订出了今年的跃进指标，插牌到田。产量指标确定以后，又根据本地区高产经验，确定了一套实现高产指标的技术措施，根据有产可超的精神，搞好“三包”，使增产指标和措施真正在群众思想上落实扎根。苏州专区在“三包”工作中，深入动员社队干部和社员鼓足干劲、找关键、挖潜力，讨论包产指标，最后确定全专区今年三麦的包产指标平均亩产三百三十四斤，水稻包产指标是九百斤。各地由于“三包”工作抓得早，群众的生产情绪更加高涨，春耕春种的物资准备做得更加好。目前全省春播作物基肥已积好三十亿担，平均每亩已有九十一担，比去年同期增加了一点六倍。春播种籽也比去年留得多、质量好。选种工作做得更加认真。以盐城专区为例，粒选与熏蒸棉种就有二千六百多万斤，选种数字比去年大大地增加。群众对今年的“三包”工作反映是：“‘三包’抓得早，生产跃进有目标”。
    全省“三包”工作的第二个特点是抓得细、抓得全。各地“三包”工作是结合社会主义教育进行的。一般的做法是，首先把今年继续跃进的大好形势向干部和社员讲清楚，然后发动群众鸣放辩论，使得社员认识到今年生产继续跃进的有利条件，和去年实现“三包一奖”的好处。思想认识提高以后，再进行“三包”方案的具体研究。很多地区在“三包”工作中，具体研究了今年“三包”工作的新情况和新特点：（1）公社化以后，生产全面大跃进，农、林、牧、副、渔，样样都要包；（2）生产条件起了变化，水利建设、土壤改良以及机械化的程度都有巨大发展；（3）1960年的田间管理工作，要普遍提高到更先进的水平。根据这些情况和特点进行“三包”，才能更加合理，有利于生产小队之间的团结。淮阴专区的沭阳县在发动群众讨论“三包”的时候，对当前生产条件的变化作了细致的研究，根据新的情况订出来的包产指标就更加合理，更加先进。有些条件改变了的地方，今年包产指标比去年上升一倍左右。例如刘集人民公社大兴生产大队1959年实收粮食一百零八万斤，由于水利条件比以前好，土壤改良工作做得好，今年包产的粮食总产量是二百零八万斤。扎下公社宋河大队去年三麦每亩包工是九个劳动日，今年田间管理的标准高了，每亩包工增加到十三个劳动日。春种玉米去年每亩包十三个劳动日，今年每亩增加到十七个劳动日。各地在包成本中注意坚持勤俭办社的原则。例如胡集公社，过去每年买商品肥料需要二万一千多元，今年这个公社计划施肥的数量虽然显著增加，但是由于发展了养猪事业，大搞自然肥料和土化肥，满足春种每亩百担肥的要求，包成本数字并没有增加，结果，社员很满意。队与队之间也没有意见。“三包”之后，劳动出勤率普遍提高。
    江苏全省当前生产出现了新的高潮。根据2月底的统计，全省三麦追施返青肥的田有三千五百多万亩，占播种面积的89％，比去年同期增长79．8％。春播备耕工作，在“苏北赶江南，江南更高产”的号召推动下，农活大大提前。特点是动手早，抓得全，规模大，标准高，基本上贯彻了扩大春播扩种面积和高产多收的精神。
