Meteorological Work Must Serve Marine Fisheries Production
Rao Xing, Deputy Director of the Central Meteorological Bureau

Under the guidance of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the radiant banner of the People's Communes, China's marine fisheries meteorological service has also developed correspondingly, achieving certain successes, under the correct leadership of Party committees at all levels, and with the joint efforts and strong collaboration of departments such as aquatic products, oceanography, public security, post and telecommunications, and broadcasting. The national marine hydrological and meteorological station network, originally planned to be built in three years, has been basically completed one year ahead of schedule; mass marine fisheries service networks have also been established in most coastal areas; and weather forecast services in coastal areas have been widely carried out. With the development of marine fisheries production, the organizational forms of mobile meteorological service stations and teams have been created. They go deep into the front lines with the fisheries production headquarters, go on ships and into the sea to investigate fishermen's experience in meteorology, and closely cooperate with fisheries production, so that meteorology can better serve fisheries production, which has been warmly welcomed by production departments and fishermen.

Spring is a peak season for marine fishing, and it is also a season with frequent cold and warm changes and many disastrous weather events. Therefore, to ensure the completion of the marine fishing production plan and ensure safe fisheries production, it is necessary to do a good job in marine meteorological services. To do a good job in marine fisheries production services, we should focus on the following five aspects:

First, meteorological departments in coastal provinces and cities must further implement the principles of "taking service to production as the key, focusing on service to aquatic products," and "accelerating construction, actively serving, vigorously collaborating, and ensuring safety" for marine hydrological and meteorological work, strengthen the production viewpoint, service viewpoint, and mass viewpoint of meteorological personnel, and truly ensure the safe production and bumper harvests of marine fisheries through meteorological services. Ensuring the safety, high yield and good harvest of marine fisheries production is the glorious political task of meteorological workers, and they are only allowed to do it well, not badly. We must correctly understand the spirit of the central government's instructions on "safety for production, production must be safe." When carrying out meteorological service work, we must not only start from safety, but also vigorously ensure the completion and overfulfillment of production tasks. Especially during the peak fishing season, we should be proactive, make specific arrangements, and do a good job in marine meteorological services. We should always pay attention to soliciting opinions from relevant parties on meteorological services and continuously improve meteorological services.

Second, strengthen the organizational work of marine meteorological services, so that meteorological services and aquatic product work are closely integrated. Meteorological departments in coastal provinces and cities should set up fixed meteorological service stations in important central fishing grounds, under the establishment of the fishing ground command departments, in order to concentrate leadership, unify command, and closely integrate meteorological work and production. When necessary, mobile meteorological service stations should also be dispatched to be responsible for marine hydrological and meteorological services under the unified leadership of the fishing ground command departments. In order to further professionalize service work, the existing mobile meteorological service stations should be gradually fixed, making them professional fisheries meteorological service stations. Meteorological personnel serving fisheries in general should also not be transferred too often, in order to familiarize themselves with the situation, accumulate experience, and facilitate service work. Because marine fisheries production is concentrated, large-scale, and ship types are complex, and the natural conditions of each fishing ground are not the same, to do a good job in fisheries production services, it is necessary to: adapt to conditions based on wind force, wind direction, waves, harbors, ship types, fishing grounds, equipment, time, personnel, tasks, and production deployment. In this way, we can adapt to various different needs. In order to deliver weather forecasts to producers in a timely manner, it is also necessary to strengthen communication and liaison work. In addition to using broadcasting, radiotelephones, mobile broadcasting, signal flags, and other methods, it is best to set up a dedicated fishing vessel near the fishing ground, carrying personnel from the command headquarters and meteorological service station, equipped with loudspeakers, to transmit weather forecasts at any time. We must not only do a good job in preparing for and preventing adverse weather; we must also not let go of any production opportunity in favorable weather, and we must do everything possible to be a good meteorological advisor for fisheries production.

An important link in strengthening marine meteorological service work is to earnestly rectify and consolidate the work of the marine meteorological service network. In coastal areas, we should establish a marine hydrological and meteorological service network that combines nationally-run marine hydrological stations and mass marine hydrological observation groups, in accordance with the requirements of "special zones have stations, counties have stations, communes have observation posts, teams have groups, and ships have personnel," combining the strength of professional marine hydrological and meteorological workers with the rich experience of fishermen in observing the sky and the sea.

Third, meteorological service stations serving marine fisheries must further apply the advanced experience of the Jinbei Meteorological Service Station in Shanxi. The weather forecasts needed for fisheries production are specific weather forecasts for local sea areas. Weather differences between islands and harbors at sea are relatively large, and some marine disastrous weather events cannot be seen on weather maps at all. Therefore, it is difficult to make accurate weather forecasts by relying solely on general weather map methods. Therefore, in marine hydrological and meteorological work, it is necessary to earnestly implement the principle of "combining large, medium, and small-scale weather forecasts, with medium and small-scale as the main focus," and combine modern marine hydrological and meteorological science with the rich experience of fishermen, and organically and flexibly apply the advanced experience of the Jinbei Meteorological Service Station in combining large, medium, and small-scale forecasts. In order to further explore the law of marine weather evolution, meteorological forecasters should strengthen summary and research work, promptly summarize the experience of success and failure in marine weather forecasting, meticulously understand the natural conditions of the region, fully study the weather characteristics of the sea area, collect and verify the rich experience of fishermen in observing the sky and the sea, analyze and organize historical data, find indicators for various weather events, especially disastrous weather and fish school forecasts, and establish an observation system for celestial phenomena, sea phenomena, and physical phenomena, in order to further improve marine weather forecasting services.

Fourth, strengthen publicity and education work, and establish the idea that man can conquer nature. We must use various publicity methods to widely and deeply publicize meteorological and aquatic product knowledge to the fishermen. Make it possible for fishermen to correctly understand and use weather forecasts. On the other hand, meteorological workers should also seriously study marine and aquatic product knowledge in order to become familiar with production conditions and better serve fisheries production. At the same time, they should also pay attention to learning from the experience of veteran fishermen in disaster prevention and emergency self-rescue, and widely publicize and promote it. For meteorological personnel in mass marine hydrological and meteorological service observation groups, various methods should also be adopted to cultivate and improve them.

Fifth, strengthen cooperation. The relationship between aquatic products and meteorology is like fish and water, inseparable. Although the division of labor is different, the goals are the same. Marine fishing without meteorological work would lose an important guarantee for life and property; marine meteorology without fisheries production would lose its main service target. Therefore, we must strengthen cooperation, closely coordinate, learn from each other, and improve together. On this basis, we must work together to do a good job in marine fisheries meteorological services and ensure the safe production of fisheries.

    气象工作要为海洋渔业生产服务
    中央气象局副局长  饶兴
    我国的海洋渔业气象服务工作，在总路线、大跃进、人民公社光辉旗帜的指引下，在各级党委正确领导、以及水产、海洋、公安、邮电、广播等部门共同努力和大力协作下，也有了相应的发展，获得了一定的成绩。原计划三年建成的全国海洋水文气象台站网，已提前一年基本建成；群众性的海洋渔业服务网，也在沿海大部分地区建立；沿海地区天气预报服务工作，已经广泛开展。随着海洋渔业生产的发展，又创造了流动气象服务台、组的组织形式。随着渔业生产指挥部，深入现场，上船下海调查渔民关于气象方面的经验，密切配合渔业生产，使气象更好地为渔业生产服务，受到了生产部门和渔民群众的热烈欢迎。
    春季是海洋渔汛旺发时期，也是冷暖交替，灾害性天气特别多的一个季节。因此，要保证海上捕捞生产计划的完成，保证渔业安全生产，必须做好海上气象服务工作。要做好海洋渔业生产服务工作，应该抓以下五个方面的工作：
    第一，沿海各省、市气象部门，必须进一步贯彻执行“以生产服务为纲、以水产服务为重点”，以及“加速建设，积极服务，大力协作，保证安全”的海洋水文气象工作方针，加强气象人员的生产观点、服务观点和群众观点，从气象服务工作上，确实保证海上渔业的安全生产和丰产丰收。保证海上渔业生产的安全和丰产丰收，是气象工作者光荣的政治任务，只准做好，不准做坏。我们必须正确地领会中央关于“安全为了生产，生产必须安全”指示的精神，在进行气象服务工作的时候，不仅要从安全出发，还要大力保证完成和超额完成生产任务。特别是在渔汛旺季，更应当积极主动，具体安排，做好海上气象服务工作。要经常注意征求有关方面对气象服务工作的意见，不断改进气象服务工作。
    第二，加强海上气象服务的组织工作。使气象服务和水产工作紧密结合起来。沿海各省、市的气象部门，在重要的中心渔场应设立固定气象服务台，归渔场指挥部门建制，以便集中领导，统一指挥，使气象工作和生产紧密结合。必要时还应派出流动气象服务台，在渔场指挥部门统一领导下，负责海洋水文气象服务工作。为了使服务工作更进一步专业化，现有的流动气象服务台应逐步固定下来，使之成为专业的渔业气象服务台。一般为渔业服务的气象人员，也不宜多所调动，以便熟悉情况，积累经验，有利于做好服务工作。由于海洋渔业集中生产，规模大，船型又较复杂，各个渔场的自然条件又不尽相同，要做好渔业生产服务，必须：因风力、因风向、因波浪、因港湾、因船型、因渔场、因设备、因时间、因人员、因任务和生产部署制宜。这样，才能适应各种不同的需要。为了使天气预报及时送到生产者手里，还必须加强通讯联络工作，除通过广播、报话机、流动广播、讯号旗等方式外，最好在渔场附近设一专用渔轮，载上指挥部和气象服务台的人员，装置扩音机，随时把天气预报传出去。我们既要做好不利天气的准备和防御工作；又要不放松一次有利天气的生产时机，要千方百计当好渔业生产的气象参谋。
    加强海上气象服务工作重要的一环，还在于切实整顿和巩固海上气象服务网的工作。在沿海地区应当按照“专区有台、县县有站、社社有哨、队队有组、船船有员”的要求，建立起国家办的海洋水文台站和群众性的海洋水文哨组相结合的海洋水文气象服务网，把专业的海洋水文气象工作者的力量和渔民群众丰富的看天看海经验结合起来。
    第三，为海洋渔业服务的气象服务台必须进一步运用山西晋北气象服务台的先进经验。渔业生产所需要的天气预报，都是局部海区海面上的具体的天气预报。海上各岛屿港湾之间天气差异比较大，有些海上灾害性天气，在天气图上根本看不出来。所以，单纯依靠一般的天气图方法，是难以做准天气预报的。因此，在海洋水文气象工作中，必须切实贯彻“天气预报大中小结合，以中小为主”的方针，把近代海洋水文气象科学和渔民的丰富经验很好地结合起来，有机地灵活地运用晋北气象服务台大中小结合的先进经验。为了进一步摸索海上天气演变的规律，气象预报人员应加强总结研究工作，及时总结海上天气预报成功与失败的经验，细致地了解本地区的自然情况，充分研究海区天气特点，收集和验证渔民看天看海的丰富经验，分析整理历史资料，找出各种天气、特别是灾害天气和渔群预报指标，建立天象、海象、物象观测制度等，以便进一步做好海上天气预报服务工作。
    第四，加强宣传教育工作，树立人定胜天的思想。要通过各种宣传方式，广泛而深入地向渔民群众宣传气象和水产的知识。使渔民群众能正确掌握和使用天气预报。另一方面，气象工作者还应认真学习海洋和水产方面的知识，以便熟悉生产情况，更好地为渔业生产服务。同时也应注意学习老渔民在预防灾难和临危自救等方面的经验，加以广泛宣传推广。对于群众性的海洋水文气象服务哨组的气象人员，也要采取各种办法，加以培养提高。
    第五，加强协作。水产和气象的关系，好像鱼水不可分离。虽然分工不同，但目的一样。海洋捕捞离开了气象工作，生命财产就失去了重要保证；海洋气象脱离了渔业生产，服务工作就失去了主要对象。因此，必须加强协作，密切配合，互相学习，共同提高，在这个基础上，为共同做好海洋渔业气象服务工作，确保渔业的安全生产而努力。
