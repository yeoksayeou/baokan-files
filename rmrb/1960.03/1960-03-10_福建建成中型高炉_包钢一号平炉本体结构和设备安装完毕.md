Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 7th March: A new medium-sized blast furnace built by the Sanming Steel Plant in Fujian Province has recently gone into production. It has an effective volume of 255 cubic meters and can produce more than 100,000 tons of iron annually.

    On the day the blast furnace tapped its first iron, the workers of the iron smelting workshop of the Sanming Steel Plant held a celebration meeting. The workers of the blast furnace section unanimously pledged to continue the vigorous technical innovation and technical revolution, vigorously promote the advanced experience of "high wind and high temperature," implement the operational policy of simultaneously increasing smelting intensity and reducing coke ratio, and strive to produce more and better pig iron for the country.

    Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 9th March: The body structure and equipment of Baotou Steel's No. 1 large open-hearth furnace have now been installed. The bulk raw material workshop related to this open-hearth furnace, as well as auxiliary projects such as integral molding, instrumentation, machine repair, and cooling, have also been basically completed or fully completed; other projects such as the installation of the hot metal furnace body and the trestle are being accelerated.

    Under the slogan of "Learn from Wuhan Steel, Catch up with Wuhan Steel, Surpass Wuhan Steel," the workers building the No. 1 open-hearth furnace have been vigorously engaged in technical innovation, promoting rapid construction, and continuously creating new records. The workers of Team 1 of the Metal Structure Company used the method of "ground assembly, overall hoisting" and carrying out a two-shift relay race, and completed the installation task of more than 740 tons of steel structure equipment in only eight and a half days, which was more than five days faster than the fastest construction period of Wuhan Steel's No. 2 open-hearth furnace. The workers of Team 4 of the Furnace Building Company dared to think and dared to act, cleverly fighting the severe cold. On the basis of learning from the advanced experience of Wuhan Steel, they boldly reformed the electric heating method, accelerated the "curing" speed of concrete, and shortened the construction period. The workers of Team 3 of the Furnace Building Company made preparations for the bricklaying project of the flue of the No. 1 open-hearth furnace in advance, prepared bricks of various specifications, carried out parallel operations in each process, closely coordinated, and supported each other. They completed the work in only four days and twenty-three hours, which was three days and one hour shorter than the fastest construction period of Wuhan Steel.

    福建建成中型高炉
    包钢一号平炉本体结构和设备安装完毕
    新华社福州7日电　福建省三明钢铁厂新建的一座中型高炉在最近投入生产。它的有效容积为二百五十五立方米，每年能产铁十万多吨。
    在这座高炉出铁的当天，三明钢铁厂炼铁车间的职工举行了庆祝会。高炉工段的工人们一致保证，一定要继续大闹技术革新和技术革命，大力推行“大风高温”的先进经验，贯彻提高冶炼强度和降低焦比双管齐下的操作方针，力争为国家增产更多更好的生铁。
    新华社包头9日电　包钢一号大型平炉本体结构和设备现在已经安装完毕。同这座平炉有关的散装原料车间，以及整模、计器、机修、冷却等辅助工程，也已基本完工或全部完工；其他如混铁炉炉体安装工程和栈桥等工程，正在加速进行。
    建设一号平炉的职工们在“学武钢，赶武钢，超武钢”的口号下，大闹技术革新，推行快速施工，连续创造了新纪录。金属结构公司一队工人用“地面组立、整体吊装”和开展两班接力赛的办法，只用八天半的时间就完成了七百四十多吨的钢结构设备安装任务，比武钢二号平炉的最快工期还快了五天多。筑炉公司四队工人敢想敢干，巧战严寒。他们在学习武钢先进经验的基础上，大胆地改革电力加热法，加快了混凝土“养生”速度，缩短了施工期。筑炉公司三队工人对一号平炉的烟道砌砖工程，事前把各种规格的砖都准备好，各工序平行作业，密切配合，互相支援，只用四天零二十三个小时就干完，比武钢的最快工期还缩短了三天零一小时。
