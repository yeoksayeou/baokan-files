Aspire to Greatness, Break Superstition, Scale Technical Peaks
Dalian Creates Automatic Gear Machining Line

    This newspaper reports that the workers of the Dalian Machine Tool Plant, breaking superstition and heading straight for the world's technological peaks, have successfully designed and trial-produced an automatic production line for gear machining. This revolutionary initiative lays a good foundation for gear machining automation and also points a direction for further improving production efficiency in the machinery industry.
    This automatic production line, composed of five machine tools, requires only a worker to press a button from the introduction of raw materials to the production of finished products, and a finished gear can be processed every ninety seconds. During the processing, if a fault occurs on the automatic line, a red signal light will immediately report to the worker. The automatic line is also equipped with a production recording device, so workers can know their production performance at any time. Gears with a diameter of eighty to two hundred millimeters, a width of fifty millimeters, and a module of two to four millimeters can be processed.
    According to the appraisal of relevant departments, this automatic line improves production efficiency by three to six times compared with the original processing method; the precision of the processed gears can be stabilized at or above the second level; the strength of the gears is 30% higher than the average, and the wear-resistant life is also longer than the average. In particular, due to the increase in strength performance, a large amount of precious metals can be saved. The cost is reduced by about 35%, and a lot is also saved in terms of factory area and manpower. The new technology it adopts is a new development direction for gear machining technology.
    The design and trial production process of the automatic gear machining line shines with the communist ideological brilliance of the working class's daring to think and act. The experimental team, mainly composed of workers and engineering technicians from the Dalian Machine Tool Plant's Comprehensive Test Laboratory, started working with no data and no experience. Some people once doubted: The automatic gear machining line is still a new topic under research in the world, can you do it? But the Party's General Line inspired them, and the Municipal Party Committee and the Factory Party Committee supported them. They used the magic weapon created in the Great Leap Forward—the "three-way combination" method—to solve various problems. During the design, everyone looked for information, everyone put forward plans, and organized "Zhuge Liang discussion meetings." A plan was drawn on the blackboard of the laboratory, and everyone discussed and overturned it; then it was drawn again and discussed again. They used the method of "designing, experimenting, affirming, and producing simultaneously" to connect design, experiment, and production into one line, greatly accelerating the speed of trial production. In more than half a year, they never stopped experimenting for a single day. After overcoming hundreds of difficulties and undergoing one failure after another, the tenacious people finally produced China's first automatic gear machining line. The precision of the first batch of gears produced reached the second-level standard.
    The creation process of this automatic gear machining line is also full of the spirit of communist large-scale collaboration. It has received strong support from the Dalian First Professional Design Office, the Industrial Science Research Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building, and the Dalian Crane Factory.

### 立大志　破迷信　攀登技术高峰  大连创造齿轮加工自动线

    立大志　破迷信　攀登技术高峰
    大连创造齿轮加工自动线
    本报讯　大连机床厂职工大破迷信，直奔世界技术高峰，设计试制成功一条齿轮加工自动生产线。这一革命性的创举，为齿轮加工自动化打下了良好基础，也为机械工业进一步提高生产效率提出了一个方向。
    这条由五台机床组成的自动生产线，从投料到制出成品，只需要工人按一下电钮，每隔九十秒钟就能加工出一个成品齿轮来。在加工过程中，如果自动线上发生了故障，红色的信号灯就会立刻向工人报告。自动线上还设有产量记录装置，工人可以随时知道自己的生产成绩。凡是直径在八十到二百毫米、宽五十毫米、模数二至四毫米范围内的齿轮，都可加工。
    据有关部门鉴定，这条自动线比原来的加工方法，生产效率提高三至六倍；加工出来的齿轮精度可稳定在二级或超过二级的水平；齿轮的强度比一般的高30％，耐磨的寿命也比一般的长。特别是由于强度性能增加，可以节约大量的贵重金属。成本降低35％左右，在厂房面积和人力方面也节省很多。它所采取的新工艺，是齿轮加工工艺新的发展方向。
    齿轮加工自动线的设计和试制过程，闪耀着工人阶级的敢想敢干的共产主义思想的光辉。以大连机床厂综合试验室的工人和工程技术人员为主的试验队伍，是在一无资料、二无经验的情况下开始工作的。曾经有人怀疑：齿轮加工自动线在世界上还是正在研究的新课题，你们能行吗？但是党的总路线鼓舞着他们，市委、工厂党委支持他们。他们运用大跃进中创造的法宝——“三结合”的方法，解决各种难题。设计时，大家找资料，大家提方案，组织“诸葛亮讨论会”。在试验室的黑板上画了一个方案，大家讨论推翻了；再画，再讨论。他们用“边设计、边试验、边肯定、边生产”的办法，把设计、试验、生产连成一条线，大大加快了试制的速度。在半年多的时间里，他们没有一天停止过试验。闯过了上百个难关，经过了一次又一次的失败，顽强的人们终于制成了我国第一条齿轮加工自动线。生产出的第一批齿轮精度就达到了二级的标准。
    这条齿轮加工自动线的创造过程，也充满了共产主义大协作的精神。它得到了大连第一专业设计处、第一机械工业部工业科学研究院和大连起重机器厂等单位的大力支援。（附图片）
