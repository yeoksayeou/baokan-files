    锡兰选举全部揭晓
    新华社科伦坡20日电　锡兰议会众议院选举最后结果今天已全部揭晓。各党派所得席位如下：
    统一国民党（1956年以前旧执政党）获得五十席；锡兰自由党（已故总理班达拉奈克创建的）四十六席；联邦党（泰米尔族地区的主要政党）十五席；人民联合阵线（前称革命平等社会党，由前粮食部长古纳瓦德纳领导）十席；平等社会党十席；锡兰民主党四席；锡兰共产党三席；无党派人士以及几个较小的政党共得十三席。
    锡兰众议院共有一百五十七个席位，其中一百五十一席由选举产生，六席由总督任命。在这次大选中，锡兰看守政府总理达哈纳亚克被击败，由于这个原因，他已在20日上午向总督提出辞呈。达哈纳亚克是在去年9月前总理班达拉奈克被谋杀后担任总理的，他也是不久前成立的民主锡兰党的领袖。
