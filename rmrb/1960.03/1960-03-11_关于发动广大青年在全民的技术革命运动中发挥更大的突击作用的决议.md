Under the wise leadership of the Party and the brilliant illumination of the General Line, a nationwide movement of technological innovation and technological revolution is unfolding with overwhelming momentum. From cities to the countryside, innovation waves are surging everywhere. From the vast army of workers and peasants to the scientific and technological ranks, everyone is filled with a spirit of fearless creation. The broad masses of young people working on all fronts are even more invigorated and high-spirited, becoming a very active shock force in the movement. Backward production methods are rapidly being replaced by advanced ones; a large number of people engaged in manual labor are being liberated from heavy physical labor; a large number of worker-peasant inventors and innovation experts are emerging; and the technical face of our industry and agriculture is changing daily. Such a massive and magnificent movement has opened up a broader path for the sustained leap forward of our national economy. Its further development will be of profound and great significance for greatly increasing labor productivity, realizing the leap forward tasks of the national economy in 1960, rapidly developing our country's scientific and technological undertakings, promoting the modernization of industry, agriculture, science, and culture, and accelerating the improvement of the cultural and technical level of young people and cultivating them into a new generation that is both red and expert. All members of the Communist Youth League and the broad masses of young people should act more consciously and actively, stand at the forefront of the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, and become the most active and courageous shock brigade.

The current technological innovation and technological revolution movement has entered a new stage of planned, organized, and led comprehensive and systematic technological transformation of all sectors of the national economy, centered on mechanization and semi-mechanization, and has developed into a broad mass movement. Whether it is industry or agriculture, commerce or transportation, or production departments or service departments, young people on all fronts should vigorously promote the mechanization and semi-mechanization movement and carry out comprehensive innovation. In the industrial sector, we must first concentrate our efforts on breaking through the weak links that consume the most labor, such as transportation, loading and unloading, mining, crushing, casting, forging, assembly, and packaging, and strive to transform all manual operations that should be changed into mechanized and semi-mechanized operations in the shortest possible time. At the same time, with the development of the movement, we must continue to expand our achievements, further realize the automation and semi-automation of mechanical operations, take the lead in adopting new technologies and promoting advanced experiences, strive to improve design, technology, tools, equipment, and labor organization, and strive to study the comprehensive utilization of resources and raw materials. In the agricultural sector, we must vigorously reform tools for deep plowing, drainage and irrigation, transportation, harvesting, agricultural product and feed processing, and, with the realization of mechanization, water conservancy, electrification, and the implementation of the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture as the key, actively promote advanced experiences and widely carry out agricultural scientific and technological research. Whether in urban or rural areas, we must attach importance to the reform of cooking tools and attach importance to the reform of tools and technological innovation in commerce, service industries, and collective welfare undertakings. The broad masses of young workers and peasants and young intellectuals in scientific research departments and universities should closely cooperate while vigorously carrying out technological innovations around the current key production tasks, strive to master cutting-edge technologies, climb the peaks of science, and make unremitting efforts to enable our country's science and technology to quickly catch up with the world's advanced levels.

In the technological innovation and technological revolution movement, we must continue to hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and adhere to the policy of self-reliance as the mainstay and the "walking on two legs" approach of combining indigenous and foreign methods. We must be good at starting from existing conditions, using foreign methods when possible, and using indigenous methods when foreign methods are not possible; constantly revolutionizing and constantly improving from indigenous to foreign methods, from small to large. Promote the spirit of solving problems on our own. Find materials ourselves if we don't have them, find ways to make equipment if we don't have it, and work hard to learn technology if we don't have it. We must never have passive dependence. Young people in our country should deeply understand that all science and technology are the summary of human productive practice and the result of human understanding of nature, and there is nothing "mysterious" about them. We must, in accordance with the teachings of the Party, set high aspirations, establish great ambitions, highly promote the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do, and resolutely break all kinds of "superstitions" and all thoughts of cowards and lazy people. We must think about problems that others dare not think about, and we must charge into difficulties that others dare not touch. In each innovation process, we must experiment thousands of times, ten thousand times, if we don't succeed once or several times. Be not proud of victory, be not discouraged by failure. We should learn from the advanced when we see it, help the backward when we see it, leave the difficulties to ourselves, give the convenience to others, and highly promote the communist spirit of cooperation. The strength of one person is limited, but the strength of everyone is infinite. As long as we, together with the 650 million people, fully exert collective wisdom, we can not only quickly change the backward face of industrial and agricultural production technology, but also master all the advanced science and technology in the world and make unprecedented great creations.

To achieve such a great task, we urgently need to master more knowledge and skills and rapidly improve our cultural, scientific, and technological knowledge level. Learning is the prerequisite for creation. Learning can promote us to create better, and creation can promote us to learn more diligently. A person who is good at learning can be a person who is good at creating, and a person who is good at creating must be a person who is good at learning. We must combine learning and creation well. We must learn diligently and humbly; learn from adults and the elderly, learn from all people with knowledge and experience; learn from books, and even more learn from practice. Young people in our country should regard the technological innovation and technological revolution movement as the largest and best school. We must actively participate in various mass scientific and technological research organizations and participate in various types of spare-time cultural schools and professional and technical training classes. While studying Chairman Mao's works, we must launch a high tide of diligently studying cultural, scientific, and technological knowledge. We warmly expect that a large number of outstanding talents who are both red and expert will emerge among the young people in our country, constantly supplementing and strengthening our country's working class's scientific and technological ranks.

Now, the nationwide technological innovation and technological revolution movement is developing wave after wave. The Communist Youth League organizations at all levels should pay close attention to the development situation of the movement, and under the unified leadership and unified deployment of the Party, closely cooperate with relevant departments, quickly formulate plans, make comprehensive arrangements, and vigorously launch mass movements. Among the broad masses of young people, we must carry out vigorous publicity and mobilization, create momentum, set off a wave, plant red flags, establish pacesetters, and enthusiastically launch a competition movement of learning, comparing, catching up, and helping. We should have a high degree of sensitivity to all new things in the movement and adopt an attitude of enthusiastic treatment, resolute protection, and active support. Realizing the comprehensive and systematic technological transformation of our country's national economy is a new thing for the vast number of League cadres. We need to go deep into production with full enthusiasm, mingle with the masses, work and learn at the same time, and change from laymen to experts. Only in this way can the League's leadership keep up with the development of the mass movement and make the League's work both vigorous and solid.

The current situation is extremely good. The Plenary Session enthusiastically hopes that the 130 million young people in our country will exert their greatest strength and wisdom in the national technological innovation and technological revolution movement, and, together with the people of the whole country, strive to push our country's scientific and technological undertakings to new heights in a not-too-long period of time, and build our great motherland into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.

    关于发动广大青年在全民的技术革命运动中发挥更大的突击作用的决议
    中国共产主义青年团第三届中央委员会第六次全体会议一九六零年三月四日通过
    在党的英明领导和总路线的光辉照耀下，一个全国性的技术革新和技术革命运动，正以排山倒海之势，汹涌澎湃地开展起来。从城市到农村，到处激荡着冲天的革新浪潮。从工农劳动大军到科学技术队伍，到处充满着大无畏的创造精神。劳动在各个战线上的广大青年，更是精神振奋，意气风发，成为运动中一支十分活跃的突击力量。落后的生产方法，迅速为先进的生产方法所代替；大量从事手工操作的人们，正在从繁重的体力劳动中解放出来；工农发明家和革新能手，大批涌现；我国工业和农业的技术面貌，每天都在发生着新的变化。这样一个声势巨大、规模壮阔的运动，为我国国民经济的持续跃进，展开了更加广阔的道路。它的进一步地发展，对于大大提高劳动生产率，实现1960年国民经济的跃进任务，对于高速度地发展我们国家的科学技术事业，促进工业、农业和科学文化的现代化；对于加速提高青年的文化技术水平，培养他们成为又红又专的新一代，都有着极其深刻的伟大的意义。全国共青团员和广大青年，应当更自觉、更积极地行动起来，站在技术革新和技术革命运动的前列，成为一支最活跃、最勇敢的突击队。
    当前的技术革新和技术革命运动，已经跨入一个以机械化、半机械化为中心的、有计划有组织有领导的、对国民经济各部门进行全面系统的技术改造的新阶段，并已发展成为一个广泛的全民运动。不论是工业和农业，商业和运输业，也不论生产部门、服务部门，各个战线上的青年，都应该大搞机械化半机械化运动，并且进行全面革新。在工业方面首先要集中力量突破运输、装卸、采掘、破碎、铸锻、装配、包装等占用劳力最多的薄弱环节，并且争取在最短时间内，把其它方面一切应当改变的手工操作，也统通改变为机械化、半机械化操作。同时，随着运动的发展，还要不断扩大战果，进一步实现机械操作自动化、半自动化，带头采用新技术和推广先进经验，努力改进设计、工艺、工具、设备和劳动组织，努力研究资源和原材料的综合利用。在农业方面，要大力进行深翻、排灌、运输、收割、农产品和饲料加工等工具的改革，并且以实现机械化、水利化、电气化和贯彻农业八字宪法为纲，积极地推广先进经验，广泛地开展农业科学技术研究。不论城市和农村，都要重视炊事工具改革，重视商业、服务业和集体福利事业方面的工具改革和技术革新。广大工农青年和科学研究部门、大专学校的知识青年，在围绕当前生产关键大搞技术革新的同时，还应当密切合作，努力掌握尖端技术，攀登科学高峰，为使我国的科学技术迅速赶上世界先进水平而进行不懈的努力。
    在技术革新和技术革命运动中，我们应当继续高举毛泽东思想的红旗，坚持贯彻执行自力更生为主和土洋并举“两条腿走路”的方针。要善于从现有条件出发，能洋就洋，不能洋就土；由土到洋、由小到大地不断革命，不断提高。发扬自己动手解决问题的精神。没有材料自己找，没有设备想法造，没有技术努力学，决不要有消极依赖思想。我国青年应当深刻了解：一切科学技术都是人类生产实践的总结，都是人对自然认识的结果，并没有什么“神秘”。我们要按照党的教导，树雄心，立大志，高度发扬敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格，坚决破除种种“迷信”，破除一切懦夫、懒汉思想。别人不敢想的问题，我们要去想；别人不敢碰的困难，我们要去冲锋陷阵。在每个革新过程中，一次、数次不成功，千次、万次地去试验。胜利不骄傲，失败不气馁。我们应当见先进就学，见落后就帮，把困难留给自己，把方便让给别人，高度发扬共产主义协作精神。一个人的力量是有限的，大家的力量就是无穷的，只要我们同六亿五千万人民一起，充分发挥集体智慧，我们就不仅可以迅速地改变工农业生产技术的落后面貌，而且能够把世界上一切先进的科学技术，统通掌握起来，作出前所未有的伟大创举。
    实现这样一个伟大的任务，迫切需要我们掌握更多的知识和技能，迅速地提高自己的文化科学技术知识水平。学习是创造的前提。学习能够促进我们更好地去创造，而创造又可以推动我们更加奋发地学习。一个善于学习的人才能够是一个善于创造的人，一个善于创造的人必定是一个善于学习的人。我们必须把学习与创造很好地结合起来。要勤奋地学，虚心地学；向成年、老年人学习，向一切有知识、有经验的人学习；向书本学习，更要在实际中学习。我国青年，应当把技术革新和技术革命运动，当作一个最大、最好的学校。要积极参加各种群众性的科学技术研究组织，参加各类业余文化学校和专业技术训练班。在学习毛主席著作的同时，掀起一个努力学习文化科学技术知识的热潮。我们热烈地期望，在我国青年中，涌现出大批优秀的又红又专的人材，不断地补充和壮大我国工人阶级的科学技术队伍。
    现在，全民性的技术革新和技术革命运动，正在一浪高过一浪地向前发展，各级共青团组织应当密切注意运动的发展形势，在党的统一领导、统一部署下，同有关部门密切协作，迅速制订规划，进行全面安排，大搞群众运动。在广大青年中，要进行大张旗鼓的宣传动员，造成声势，掀起浪潮，大插红旗，大树标兵，热烈展开学、比、赶、帮的竞赛运动。对待运动中的一切新生事物，应当具有高度的敏感，采取热情对待、坚决保护和积极扶植的态度。实现我国国民经济全面的系统的技术改造，对于广大团的干部说来，是一件新的事情，需要我们满腔热情地深入到生产中去，和群众打成一片，一面工作，一面学习，由外行变成内行。只有这样，才能使团的领导跟上群众运动的发展，把团的工作做得既轰轰烈烈，又扎扎实实。
    当前形势极为良好。全会热烈希望，我国一亿三千万青年，在全民的技术革新和技术革命运动中，发挥出最大的力量和智慧，同全国人民一起，争取在一个不太长的时间内，把我国的科学技术事业推向新的高峰，把我们伟大的祖国，建设成为具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国。
