    To Allow the Large Quantities of Products Produced in the Great Leap Forward to Leave Factories Quickly
    Shanghai Vigorously Promotes Packaging Mechanization

    (Our dispatch) Shanghai – In response to the inadequacy of manual packaging after the leap forward in production, the broad masses of workers in Shanghai's light industry and other departments are vigorously engaging in technological innovation, creating mechanized and semi-mechanized packaging machines, which have multiplied packaging efficiency.

    According to incomplete statistics from more than ten industries, including food, enamel, leather making, pharmaceuticals, hardware for daily use, and chemicals for daily use, more than thirty types of mechanized and semi-mechanized packaging machines have been successfully developed to date. These packaging machines can almost completely replace the manual packaging that still exists in Shanghai's major light industrial sectors with machine operation. Now, not only do products such as cigarettes, sweets, washbasins, leather, matches, toothpaste, and soap, which previously used the most packaging labor, have dedicated packaging machines, but also liquids and viscous products such as ink, injections, printing ink, and cold cream, which have been considered difficult to escape from manual packaging for decades, now have their own filling machines. Some products even have machines for attaching labels and stamping brand names.

    Most of these packaging machines are now in production, and their efficiency has generally increased by more than double, or even more than tenfold. The cigarette small-pack machine successfully tested by workers at the Shanghai No. 2 Cigarette Factory can pack 100 packs of cigarettes per minute, an efficiency increase of seventeen times compared to manual packaging. The machine used by Lisheng Needle Factory to package sewing needles not only doubles efficiency, but also ensures that the needles do not come into contact with human hands during packaging, solving the problem of easy rusting with manual packaging in the past, which can extend the storage time of products and ensure product quality. The match and enamel basin packaging machines at the Huaguang Match Factory and the Huafeng Enamel Factory not only improve packaging efficiency but also save a significant amount of packaging paper. After the Chinese Chemical Industry Society successfully developed the toothpaste packaging machine, the potential of the equipment in the first few processes was also fully exploited, and the output of toothpaste more than doubled compared to the past, equivalent to building a new factory of the same scale.

    In the process of mobilizing the masses to achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization of packaging operations, factories in various industries have adopted the methods of universal creation, extensive exchange, timely standardization, and comprehensive promotion, and have adopted the principle of combining indigenous and foreign methods, from rough to fine, from low to high, and from simple to complex, greatly accelerating the speed of mechanization. They spent very little money, but the results were great.

    Currently, the mass movement for mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual packaging is still developing, and the relevant departments are strengthening their leadership in this work. The Shanghai Municipal Light Industry Bureau recently organized two large-scale on-site exchange meetings, focusing on both innovation and creation and summarizing and promoting. At the end of February, the city held the "Exhibition of Advanced Experience in Mechanization and Semi-Mechanization of Packaging," and simultaneously held the "Promotion Week of Advanced Experience in Mechanization and Semi-Mechanization of Packaging," which launched an even larger-scale experience exchange activity in the city.

### 让跃进浪潮中生产的大量产品迅速出厂  上海大闹包装机械化

    让跃进浪潮中生产的大量产品迅速出厂
    上海大闹包装机械化
    本报讯　上海轻工业等部门广大职工针对生产跃进以后手工包装不相适应的情况，大搞技术革新，创造机械化、半机械化的包装机器，包装效率成倍提高。
    据食品、搪瓷、制革、制药、日用五金、日用化学等十多个行业不完全的统计，到目前为止，已经研究成功的机械化、半机械化的包装机共有三十多种。这些包装机几乎可以把上海主要轻工业行业中目前还存在的手工包装，全部改为机器操作。现在，不仅香烟、糖果、面盆、皮革、火柴、牙膏、肥皂等过去占用包装劳动力最多的产品，有了专门的包装机器，连墨水、针剂、油墨、冷霜等液体和粘性的、几十年来一直被认为难以摆脱手工包装的产品，也都有了各自的灌装机。有些产品甚至有了贴商标、打牌号的机器。
    这些包装机器目前大部分已投入生产，效率一般要提高一倍以上甚至十多倍。上海卷烟二厂工人试验成功的卷烟小包机，一分钟可以包装一百包香烟，效率比手工包装提高了十七倍。利生制针厂包装缝衣针的机器，不但效率提高了一倍半，而且在包装时，人手不接触产品，解决了过去手工包针容易生锈的问题，可以延长产品的贮藏时间，保证产品质量。华光火柴厂、华丰搪瓷厂的火柴、搪瓷盆包装机，既提高了包装效率，又节省了大量的包装用纸。中国化学工业社研究成功了牙膏包装机后，前几道工序上的设备潜力，也都充分发挥出来，牙膏的产量比过去提高一倍以上，等于新建了一个同样规模的工厂。
    各行业工厂在发动群众实现包装操作机械化、半机械化过程中，采取了普遍创造、广泛交流、及时定型、全面推广的办法，并且采取土洋结合，由粗到精，由低到高，由简到繁的方针，大大加快了机械化的速度。花钱都很少，效果却很大。
    目前，手工包装实现机械化、半机械化的群众运动还在不断发展中，各有关部门正在加强对这一工作的领导。上海市轻工业局最近先后组织了两次大型现场交流会议，一手抓革新创造，一手抓总结推广。2月底，全市举办了“包装机械化半机械化先进经验展览会”，同时举行了“包装机械化半机械化先进经验推广周”，在全市掀起了更大规模的经验交流活动。（附图片）
