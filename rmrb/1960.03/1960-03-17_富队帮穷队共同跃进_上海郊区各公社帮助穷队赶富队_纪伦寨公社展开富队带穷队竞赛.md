Rich Teams Help Poor Teams Advance Together
Shanghai Suburban Communes Help Poor Teams Catch Up with Rich Teams
Jilunzhai Commune Launches Competition of Rich Teams Leading Poor Teams
    (Reported by this newspaper) Since the establishment of people's communes in Shanghai's rural areas a little over a year ago, the economic level of most production teams in the suburban communes of Shanghai has improved, and the number of poor teams has rapidly decreased from about 16% of the total number of production teams to about 5%. This year, the county committees and commune party committees of various counties have transferred a large number of cadres to further strengthen the work of poor teams. After the director of the Shuyuan Commune and the deputy minister of sideline occupations in Nanhui County went to the Xinbei Production Team and the Youyi Production Team, they carefully investigated the objective conditions of these poor teams, mobilized the masses, and formulated plans to change the face of the poor teams. Many cadres sent by counties and communes to poor teams also eat, live, and work with the commune members, get along with the masses closely in production and life, and help the poor teams develop production in many ways.
    The national economic departments and the commune-owned economy also provide economic support to the poor teams in many ways. For example, when issuing agricultural loans and advance payments for agricultural products such as cotton, the needs of the poor teams are taken care of first. The 500,000 yuan of interest-free loans issued by relevant departments in Jiading County this year mainly help poor teams replenish production funds. Due to the small number of pigs raised by the Xuangao and Mamen poor teams in Waigang Commune, there were difficulties in topdressing summer crops for a time. The commune and various rich teams transferred more than 10,000 dan of fertilizer to support them in timely topdressing the wheat and rapeseed fields, solving the fertilizer shortage.
    The leadership of the Party and the support of the state and communes to the poor teams have greatly encouraged the commune members and cadres of the poor teams. Many poor teams have set high ambitions, worked hard, and strived to catch up with the rich teams this year. In the past, the Sanliqiao Production Team of Loutang Commune was restricted by natural conditions and cultivated extensively. About 34% of the summer crops were third-class seedlings. However, this year, the commune members are in high spirits and have strengthened field management. Wheat and rapeseed have been topdressed two to three times. At present, the seedlings are growing strongly, and the area of third-class seedlings has been reduced to about 7%. Most of the cotton fields have also been cultivated and applied with base fertilizer. The fifth production team of Chengdong Commune in Chongming County has many low-lying fields within its territory, which are often flooded and have low yields. This year, they seized this problem and launched a mass movement to turn low-lying fields into high-lying fields and barren fields into fertile fields. Recently, they have dug twenty-seven mu of low-lying fields into fish ponds and used the dug-up soil to pad another twenty-seven mu of low-lying fields, preparing to plant cotton.

    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) The production competition movement of "seeing who brings the poor teams the best" launched by the Jilunzhai Commune in Guoyang County, Anhui Province, centered on the rich teams and divided into three areas, has resulted in the rapid catch-up of all the "poor teams" in the commune with the rich teams after a year of competition under the leadership and assistance of the rich teams.

    At the beginning of the spring ploughing this year, while continuing to carry out the competition of bringing good "poor teams" between areas, the "poor teams" in each area have also launched a competition with the rich teams because they already have a better production foundation. The Jianglaojia Brigade and the Huaguang Brigade, which were originally helped by the Jilunzhai Brigade, have started to compete with the Jilunzhai Brigade.

    Since last year, the Jilunzhai Commune has centered on the three rich teams of Jilunzhai, Jiangji, and Jiwangchang, each leading several poor teams, and divided them into three areas to carry out competition.

    At the beginning of the competition, the three units competing in different areas of the entire commune showed a lively situation in which the rich teams tried every means to help the "poor teams" engage in production, and the "poor teams" also went all out to catch up with the rich teams. According to the principle of equal value exchange, mutual assistance and mutual benefit, the rich teams first helped the "poor teams" rush to dig thirty-four large and small ditches to improve water conservancy conditions. At the same time, with the support of the rich team, the "poor team" Rongguang Brigade dug two more rivers in one winter and spring, ensuring the water supply for expanding rice cultivation. The rich teams also took the initiative to help the poor teams analyze production conditions and cultivation conditions, and provided specific assistance based on the specific conditions of the "poor teams". For example, the Jiangji Brigade analyzed that the most difficult thing for the Rongguang Brigade in production was the lack of seeds and labor, so they often delayed the sowing period, which affected the yield. Therefore, they immediately transferred 18,000 jin of sweet potato seedlings from this brigade to support the Rongguang Brigade and help them sow in a timely manner; when labor was tight during wheat harvest, they extracted 520 laborers to help them harvest wheat.

    The rich teams also attached great importance to seriously imparting various yield-increasing technologies to the "poor teams", and took the initiative to adopt the method of "master leading apprentice" to help the "poor teams" learn technology.

    The support of the rich teams to the poor teams greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the poor teams. They proposed, "Do not hold back the rich teams, resolutely catch up with the advanced teams." In order to win a bumper harvest in the drought last summer, the commune members of the various "poor teams" fought day and night in the fields, using waterwheels to irrigate rice fields and dry land, and also tried their best to develop diversified economic production to increase the income of the brigade. For example, the Siluqiao Brigade rarely raised fish in the past. Last year, under the leadership of the advanced teams, they released 130,000 fish fry in one go.

    Through the competition of the past year, the agricultural and sideline income of all fifteen rich and poor teams in the commune has been greatly improved. The grain yield per mu of the three rich teams has increased by about 30% compared with the Great Leap Forward in 1958, while the increase in production of the poor teams is even more significant. The grain yield per mu of the Huaguang, Rongguang and other poor teams has increased by 80% to more than 100% compared with 1958. Due to the increase in grain yield and the rapid development of diversified economic activities, the income of commune members has caught up with that of the rich teams in one year.

    富队帮穷队共同跃进
    上海郊区各公社帮助穷队赶富队
    纪伦寨公社展开富队带穷队竞赛
    本报讯　上海农村各人民公社积极帮助穷队猛赶富队。人民公社成立一年多来，上海郊区各公社大部分生产队的经济水平都有提高，穷队也迅速从原来占生产队总数的16％左右下降到5％左右。今年，各县县委和公社党委调出大批干部，进一步加强穷队的工作。南汇县书院公社主任和副业部长到新北生产队和友谊生产队以后，认真调查这些穷队的客观条件，发动群众，制订规划，决心改变穷队的面貌。许多县和公社派往穷队的干部还和社员同吃同住同劳动，在生产和生活中和群众密切相处，多方面地帮助穷队发展生产。
    国家经济部门和公社社有经济也在经济上多方面给穷队以支持。如发放农业贷款、发放棉花等农产品定金时，首先照顾到穷队的需要。嘉定县有关部门今年发放的五十万元无息贷款，主要帮助穷队充实生产资金。外冈公社宣高、马门两个穷队由于养猪少，夏熟追肥一度发生困难，公社和各个富队调了一万多担肥料，支援他们及时追到三麦和油菜田里，解决肥料不足困难。
    党的领导和国家、公社对穷队的支持，给穷队社员和干部极大鼓舞。许多穷队立下雄心大志，发奋图强，要在今年赶上富队。娄塘公社三里桥生产队，往年因受到自然条件限制，耕作粗放，约有34％的夏熟作物是三类苗，但今年社员们意志昂扬，加强了田间管理，三麦油菜普遍追了二至三次肥料，目前禾苗生长健壮，三类苗面积下降到7％左右，并且大部分棉田已进行了中耕，施上基肥。崇明县城东公社第五生产队境内有不少低田，经常遭水淹没，产量很低。今年他们就抓住这个问题开展了低田改高田、荒田变良田的群众运动，最近已经将二十七亩低田挖成鱼池，用挖下来的泥土垫到另外二十七亩低田上去，准备播种棉花。
    据新华社讯　安徽涡阳县纪伦寨公社以富队为中心分成三片开展的“看谁把穷队带得最好”的生产竞赛运动，经过去年一年的竞赛，全社“穷队”的生产在富队的带动和帮助下，都很快赶上富队。
    今年春耕一开始，在继续开展片与片间带好“穷队”的竞赛的同时，各个片内的“穷队”，由于已经有了较好的生产基础，还和富队展开了竞赛。原来由纪伦寨大队帮助的江老家大队和华光大队，已和纪伦寨大队赛了起来。
    纪伦寨公社自去年开始，就以纪伦寨、江集、纪王场三个富队为中心，各自带动几个穷队，并分成三片开展竞赛。
    竞赛一开始，全社三个分片竞赛的单位，就出现了富队千方百计帮助“穷队”搞生产、“穷队”也鼓足干劲赶富队的生动活泼的局面。根据等价交换互助互利的原则，各富队首先帮助“穷队”突击开挖大、小河沟三十四条，改善水利条件。同时，“穷队”荣光大队在富队支持下，一个冬春又开挖了两条河，保证了扩种水稻的用水。各个富队还主动地帮助穷队分析生产条件和耕作情况，针对“穷队”的具体情况，给予具体帮助。如江集大队分析了荣光大队生产上最感困难的是种子欠缺、劳力不足，因此往往拖延播种期，影响产量，便立即从这个大队调配红薯秧一万八千斤支援荣光大队，帮助他们适时下种；在麦收劳动力紧张时，又抽出五百二十个劳动力帮助他们收麦子。
    各个富队也非常重视向“穷队”认真传授各种增产技术，主动地采取“师傅带徒弟”的办法，帮助“穷队”学技术。
    富队对穷队的支援，大大鼓舞了穷队的生产积极性，他们提出，“不拖富队后腿，坚决赶上先进队”，去年夏天为了在干旱中夺得丰收，各个“穷队”的社员，都日夜奋战田头，车水浇灌稻田和旱地，并且还尽量自力更生地发展多种经济生产，以增加大队的收入。如四里桥大队过去很少养鱼，去年在先进队的带动下，一鼓作气放养了鱼苗十三万尾。
    通过去年一年来的竞赛，全社十五个富队和穷队的农副业收入，都有了很大的提高。三个富队的粮食亩产量都比大跃进的1958年增加30％左右，而穷队的增产幅度更为显著，华光、荣光等穷队粮食亩产量都比1958年提高八成到一倍以上。由于粮食产量增加，多种经济获得迅速发展，社员的收入一年就赶上了富队。
