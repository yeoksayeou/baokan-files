Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 29th. Cuban Prime Minister Castro announced in a television broadcast this morning that the Cuban Revolutionary Government does not recognize the Rio Treaty. He said that the Cuban Revolutionary Government bears no obligation to any international treaties it did not participate in signing.

The Rio Treaty, which the United States imposed on Latin American countries in 1947, is a tool used by the United States to suppress national and democratic movements in Latin American countries.

While criticizing U.S. Secretary of State Herter's threatening remarks against Cuba, Castro accused Herter of attempting to invoke the Rio Treaty against Cuba under the pretext of anti-communism. He said that the people of Latin American countries will never allow these treaties to be used to invade Cuba.

Castro said that while the U.S. government talks about the "patience" of its "uncompromising" attitude toward Cuba, Cuba is being subjected to aggression. He asked people to pay attention to the intensified anti-communist propaganda, aimed at opposing the Cuban Revolutionary Government, which has accelerated since the return of U.S. Ambassador to Cuba Bonsal to Havana. He pointed out that this anti-communist propaganda is echoing other unfriendly activities of the United States against Cuba: its refusal to sell Cuba helicopters; allowing former dictator Batista's Army Chief of Staff Pedraza to engage in conspiracy activities on U.S. territory; recruiting soldiers from the former dictatorial army at Guantanamo Base, etc. Castro emphasized that until the United States has demonstrated its friendship towards Cuba with facts, the Cuban Ambassador to Washington will not return to his embassy. At the same time, he reiterated Cuba's readiness to resolve the problems between the two countries through negotiations.

Castro emphasized that the anti-communist propaganda aimed at opposing the Cuban Revolution is part of the U.S. imperialism's aggression plan against the Cuban Revolution. Those who stir up anti-communist propaganda within Cuba are fifth columnists attempting to create conditions for turning Cuba into another Spain. Castro asked, are they trying to make us reorganize the Batista suppression machine against communists and all democrats, are they trying to turn us into fascists? He said that those guys who want to persecute communists, who want us to become fascists or Falangists, are enemies of the revolution. They are attempting to split the people and isolate Cuba, inserting a sharp knife into the back of the revolution.

While recounting the history of the revolutionary movement program against Batista's tyranny, Castro pointed out that Cuba still has several tasks to complete, such as nationalizing the American Electric Company and the Telephone Company. He assured that this work must be completed. He said that the 26th of July Movement is an organization of the poor, by the poor, and for the poor, a revolution.

Castro emphasized that the imperialists are attacking Cuba, and the people will defend the motherland and defend the revolution. He said that if an invasion occurs, it will be a life-and-death battle. Every building and every factory in Cuba will become a fortress. He asked, when we can mobilize half a million men ready to fight, how can professional armies intimidate us?

Castro said that strong self-defense measures will be taken against the activities of the fifth columnists.

While refuting the anti-communist fallacies of Cuban reactionary television commentator Conte Agüero, Castro said, "We are only against those who oppose our government. We are only against the bases from which planes take off to burn Cuban sugarcane fields. Do they want to make us enemies of the Chinese? No, sir. The Chinese have not done anything against us. Communists, Marxists, and leftists all agree with Cuba's revolutionary laws. I cannot be blamed for this."

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 29th. Marie-Claude Vaillant-Couturier, Secretary General of the Secretariat of the Women's International Democratic Federation, sent telegrams on the 26th to four women's organizations, including the Federation of Cuban Women and the Cuban Women's Congress for Latin American Liberation, expressing active support for the tireless and heroic struggle of Cuban women and all the Cuban people to defend national sovereignty and build a new life.

Vaillant-Couturier also sent a telegram to the Cuban Workers' Confederation, actively supporting the activities of "Latin American People's Support Week" and the just struggle of the Latin American people to win democracy, freedom and sovereignty.

    卡斯特罗谴责赫脱对古巴的威胁
    指出反共宣传是美帝国主义侵略计划的一部分
    宣布古巴不承认美国所强加的里约热内卢公约
    新华社哈瓦那29日电　古巴总理卡斯特罗今天早晨在电视广播演说中宣布，古巴革命政府不承认里约热内卢公约。他说，古巴革命政府对它没有参与签订的一切国际条约不承担义务。
    美国在1947年强加于拉丁美洲国家的里约热内卢公约，是美国用来镇压拉丁美洲国家的民族民主运动的工具。
    卡斯特罗在抨击美国国务卿赫脱威胁古巴的言论时，指责赫脱企图在反共的借口下援用里约热内卢公约来反对古巴。他说，拉丁美洲各国人民绝不允许利用这些条约来侵略古巴。
    卡斯特罗说，当美国政府谈到对古巴的“不妥协”态度的“耐性”时，古巴却在受到侵略。他要求人们注意美国驻古巴大使邦沙尔返回哈瓦那后加剧了的目的在于反对古巴革命政府的反共宣传。他指出，这种反共宣传是同美国对古巴的其它不友好活动相呼应的：它拒绝卖给古巴直升飞机；允许前独裁者巴蒂斯塔的陆军总监佩德拉萨在美国领土上进行阴谋活动；在关塔那摩基地募集前独裁军的士兵等等。卡斯特罗强调说，当美国还没有用事实来证明它对古巴的友谊时，古巴驻华盛顿的大使就不回他的使馆。同时，他重申古巴准备通过谈判解决两国之间的问题。
    卡斯特罗强调指出，目的在于反对古巴革命的反共宣传是美帝国主义反对古巴革命的侵略计划的一部分。在古巴国内煽起反共宣传的那些人是企图为把古巴变成另一个西班牙创造条件的第五纵队分子。卡斯特罗问道，他们是否企图使我们重新组织起反对共产党人和所有民主人士的巴蒂斯塔镇压机器，是否要使我们变成法西斯分子呢？他说，那些希望迫害共产党人，希望我们成为法西斯分子或长枪党人的家伙是革命的敌人。他们企图分裂人民和孤立古巴，在革命的背后插入一把尖刀。
    卡斯特罗在叙述反对巴蒂斯塔暴政的革命运动纲领的历史时指出，古巴还有几项任务需要完成，例如把美国电力公司和电话公司这两家公司收归国有。他保证，这个工作一定要完成。他说，7月26日运动是为了贫苦人的、由贫苦人进行的贫苦人的革命的组织。
    卡斯特罗强调指出，帝国主义者攻击古巴，而人民将保卫祖国和保卫革命。他说，假如发生侵略，这将是殊死的战斗。古巴的每一幢建筑物、每一家工厂都将成为堡垒。他问道；当我们能够动员起五十万男子准备斗争的时候，职业的军队怎么会吓倒我们呢？
    卡斯特罗说，对于第五纵队分子的活动，将采取强有力的自卫措施。
    在驳斥古巴反动电视评论员孔特·阿古埃罗的反共谬论时，卡斯特罗说，“我们只是反对那些反对我们的政府。我们只是反对飞机从那里起飞来焚烧古巴甘蔗田的基地。他们是不是想使我们成为中国人的敌人呢？不，先生。中国人没有做反对我们的事情。共产主义者、马克思主义者以及左派人士一致同意古巴的革命法律。不能为此而责备我。”
    新华社柏林29日电　国际民主妇女联合会书记处总书记桑蒂26日致电古巴革命妇女联盟和古巴妇女争取拉丁美洲解放大会等四个妇女团体，表示积极支援古巴妇女和全体古巴人民为保卫国家主权和为建设新生活所进行的不倦的、英勇的斗争。
    桑蒂还致电古巴工人联合会，积极支持“支援拉丁美洲人民周”的活动和拉丁美洲人民为争取民主自由和主权所进行的正义斗争。
