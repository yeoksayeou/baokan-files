Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 9th. Poland is taking various measures to vigorously develop its pig farming industry. According to estimates from relevant departments, the total number of pigs in Poland will increase to 15 million in the first half of this year, meaning an average of one pig for every two people in the country.

Poland has a long tradition of pig farming, exporting 100,000 tons of pork annually; Polish ham enjoys a high reputation around the world. After liberation, the people's government has paid more attention to the development of pig farming. Last year, the number of pigs nationwide had already increased from 7 million before the war to 11.2 million.

For the further development of pig farming, agricultural departments in various regions began to establish feed bases last autumn, allocating tens of thousands of hectares of land from state-owned farms specifically for planting corn, potatoes, and other feed crops. In January and February of this year, the state trading agencies also supplied farmers with 30% more feed than in the same period last year. In addition, the agricultural departments also instructed state-owned farms in various regions to raise pigs on a large scale. The current number of pigs in stock on state-owned farms has reached 500,000 and is growing rapidly month by month. It is estimated that state-owned farms will hand over 50,000 tons of pork to the state this year. In order to encourage and help agricultural production cooperatives and individual farmers raise pigs, state trading agencies have also signed pre-purchase contracts for one million pigs with farmers. In January and February, Poland exceeded its meat procurement plan by more than 12,000 tons.

    波兰大力发展养猪业
    今年将达到平均每两人一头猪
    新华社华沙9日电　波兰正在采取各种措施大力发展养猪事业。据有关部门估计，今年上半年波兰全国猪的头数就将增加到一千五百万头，即全国平均每两人就有一头猪。
    波兰养猪事业有悠久的传统，每年出口的猪肉达十万吨；波兰火腿在世界各地并享有很高声誉。解放后，人民政权更加重视发展养猪事业。去年全国猪的头数已经由战前的七百万头增加到一千一百二十万头。
    为了养猪事业的进一步发展，从去年秋天开始，各地农业部门又着手建立饲料基地，从国营农场拨出了成万公顷的土地，用来专门种植玉米、土豆及其他饲料作物。在今年1、2月份，国家贸易机关供应农民的饲料也比去年同时期增加了30％。此外，农业部门还责成各地国营农场大量养猪。现在国营农场猪的存栏数已达五十万头，而且在逐月迅速增长。预计国营农场今年上缴给国家的猪肉将达五万吨。为了鼓励和帮助农业生产合作社和个体农民养猪，国家贸易机关还同农民签订了一百万头猪的预购合同。1、2月份波兰已超额一万二千多吨完成了肉类收购计划。
