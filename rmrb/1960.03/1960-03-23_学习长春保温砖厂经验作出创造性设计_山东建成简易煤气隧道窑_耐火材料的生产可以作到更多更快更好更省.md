    Shandong Builds Simple Gas Tunnel Kiln
    More, Faster, Better, and More Economical Production of Refractory Materials Can Be Achieved
    (Our report) The Shandong Refractory Materials Factory has successfully experimented with a simple gas tunnel kiln for firing refractory materials, which is of great significance for rapidly increasing the output of refractory materials and meeting the needs of steel production.
    At present, most refractory material factories in China use down-draft kilns to fire refractory materials. The disadvantages of this type of kiln are its long production cycle (generally four days from loading to unloading) and high coal consumption. Kiln workers often have to work in temperatures of seventy or eighty degrees, making labor conditions very difficult. At the end of 1958, the Changchun Insulating Brick Factory built a 20-meter-long simple tunnel kiln on a trial basis. After the news came, the Party committee of this factory immediately sent people to "learn from the experience." They creatively learned from the experience of others, and based on the principles of the simple tunnel kiln of the Changchun Insulating Brick Factory, they researched and designed a 42-meter-long simple tunnel kiln. Based on this, they built a simple gas tunnel kiln on a trial basis in December of last year.
    The simple gas tunnel kiln has a very simple structure. It includes a tunnel-shaped kiln body made of refractory bricks, 45 meters long, 2.6 meters high, and 1.1 meters wide, and a gas generator with a hearth area of 9 square meters. In addition, light rails are installed inside and outside the kiln. When firing, workers load the green bricks onto kiln cars outside the kiln, and a pusher sends them into the kiln. Approximately every 50 minutes, a carload of finished products can be pulled out. After cooling and unloading, the bricks are reloaded and sent into the kiln for preheating and firing. The 22 kiln cars circulate inside and outside the kiln in this way, keeping production running day and night.
    Judging from the results in the initial stage of production, the various economic indicators of this simple gas tunnel kiln are far superior to those of down-draft kilns, and some indicators are comparable to those of regular tunnel kilns. Its advantages are, first of all, its high utilization coefficient and short production cycle: the simple gas tunnel kiln can fire about 800 kilograms of clay refractory material per cubic meter per day and night, while the down-draft kiln can only fire more than 200 kilograms. The production cycle of the down-draft kiln is four days, while the production cycle of the simple gas tunnel kiln is only one day. Secondly, coal consumption is significantly reduced: the down-draft kiln requires about 350 kilograms of high-quality coal to fire one ton of refractory material, while the simple gas tunnel kiln only requires about 170 kilograms, which is about the same as the coal consumption of a regular tunnel kiln, and low-quality coal can be used. Thirdly, the labor conditions for workers have been greatly improved: for many years, kiln workers have been firing kilns, loading kilns, and unloading kilns in high temperatures; now the entire operation process is carried out at normal temperatures. In addition, the cost of this simple tunnel kiln is about 12% lower than that of the down-draft kiln; the reject rate has also been reduced from 8% for the down-draft kiln to about 6%. This simple gas tunnel kiln also requires less investment and steel, and construction is fast and the technology is easy to master. (Photo attached)

    学习长春保温砖厂经验作出创造性设计
    山东建成简易煤气隧道窑
    耐火材料的生产可以作到更多更快更好更省
    本报讯　山东耐火材料厂试验成功烧制耐火材料的简易煤气隧道窑，对迅速提高耐火材料的产量，满足钢铁生产需要具有重要意义。
    目前，我国绝大部分耐火材料厂都使用倒焰窑烧制耐火材料。这种窑炉的缺点是生产周期长（一般从装窑到出窑需要四天时间）、耗煤量很大；烧窑工人经常要在七、八十度的温度下工作，劳动条件比较艰苦。1958年底，长春保温砖厂试建了一座二十米长的简易隧道窑。消息传来后，这个厂的党委马上派人去“取经”。他们创造性地学习了人家的经验，根据长春保温砖厂简易隧道窑的原理，又研究设计出一种四十二米长的简易隧道窑，并在这个基础上，于去年12月试建成一座简易煤气隧道窑。
    简易煤气隧道窑结构很简单。它包括一条用耐火砖砌成的长四十五米、高二点六米、宽一点一米的隧道形的窑身和一座九平方米炉棚面积的煤气发生炉。另外，在窑内外还设有轻便铁轨。烧窑时，工人在窑外把砖坯装上窑车，由推车机送入窑内，约每隔五十分钟就可以拉出一车烧成的成品；等冷却卸车后，又重新装上砖坯，送进窑内预热、焙烧。二十二辆窑车就这样在窑内外循环周转，使生产终日不停。
    从生产初期的效果看，这种简易煤气隧道窑的各项经济指标都大大超过倒焰窑，有些指标与正规隧道窑也不相上下。它的优点首先是利用系数高，生产周期短：简易煤气隧道窑每立方米每昼夜可以烧八百公斤左右的粘土耐火材料，而倒焰窑只能烧二百多公斤；倒焰窑每一生产周期是四天，而简易煤气隧道窑生产周期只要一天。其次是煤耗显著降低：倒焰窑烧一吨耐火材料约需三百五十公斤优质煤炭，而简易煤气隧道窑只要一百七十公斤左右，与正规隧道窑的耗煤量相差无几，并且可以使用劣质煤。第三是工人的劳动条件大大改善：多少年来烧窑工人都是在高温下烧窑，装窑，出窑；而现在的整个操作过程都在正常的气温下进行。另外，这种简易隧道窑成本比倒焰窑约低12％左右；废品率也由倒焰窑的8％降为6％左右。这种简易煤气隧道窑投资和所需要的钢材也少，而且建设速度快，技术容易掌握。（附图片）
