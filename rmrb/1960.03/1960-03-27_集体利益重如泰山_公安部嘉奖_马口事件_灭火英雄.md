Xinhua News Agency, March 26th – The Ministry of Public Security recently issued a circular to public security organs in all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country, commending the heroic actions of public security cadres and police officers of the Makou Pyrite Mine in Yingde County, Guangdong Province, in extinguishing a fire. It also called on all public security personnel to learn and promote their communist spirit. The circular stated that when a fire broke out at the Makou Paper Mill on February 26th, the public security cadres and police officers of the Makou Pyrite Mine, in order to rescue state property, bravely rushed into the thick smoke and flames. When the fire was about to be brought under control, a diesel barrel suddenly exploded, tragically causing the heroic sacrifice of twelve comrades and injuries to twenty-nine comrades. The deeds created by the public security cadres and police officers of the Makou Pyrite Mine are a brilliant example of people's public security personnel dedicating themselves to the interests of the country and the people.

The circular stated, "The comrades in the 'Makou Incident' accepted the Party's education and possessed strong revolutionary will and noble class qualities. Therefore, when the interests of the country and the people were harmed, they were able to step forward bravely; in the face of life-and-death emergencies, they were able to be tenacious and unyielding; they regarded the interests of the collective as more important than Mount Tai and their personal interests as lighter than a feather. These comrades shed their blood and sacrificed themselves for the revolutionary cause, made outstanding contributions to the people, and should be loved by the people and commended by the Party and the government." The Yingde County Party Committee has decided to posthumously recognize comrades Su Manji and Shen Fafu, who demonstrated outstanding model deeds in this incident, as members of the Communist Party of China. The Ministry of Public Security has decided to issue a circular of commendation to all cadres and police officers who participated in the firefighting efforts. The Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department should also, based on the glorious deeds of each comrade, give them merit citations and awards separately to encourage and commend them.

The circular stated that the public security cadres and police officers of the Makou Pyrite Mine, the heroic firefighters, have erected a bright and unfading communist red flag in our public security ranks. The care and love shown by the Party committee and the masses for the injured comrades is even more a song of triumph for communism. Public security organs in all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions should closely integrate with the current communist education movement and organize all public security personnel to study this typical event, so that everyone can receive a more practical and profound education in communist ideology and communist style, strive to improve their communist qualities, and aspire to train themselves into the most popular people, feared by the enemy and loved by the people. We require all public security personnel to promote the noble communist spirit of this group of public security cadres and police officers in the "Makou Incident" with their practical actions.
