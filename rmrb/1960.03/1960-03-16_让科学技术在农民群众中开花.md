Let Science and Technology Blossom Among the Peasant Masses
Zhang Wenlin, First Secretary of the CPC Wuzhong Municipal Committee

    In the sustained leap forward of 1959, the Hui and Han peasant masses of Wuzhong City, carrying forward the communist spirit of daring to think and daring to act, actively studied various agricultural sciences and technologies and participated in scientific research activities, enabling the city's agricultural science and technology ranks to grow stronger day by day. At present, in addition to nearly 100 senior and intermediate agricultural technicians, the city has also adopted various methods to train 7,176 primary technical personnel in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries in rural areas, accounting for 36.9% of the city's total rural labor force. Over the past year, they have implemented agricultural technological transformation based on the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture and carried out scientific and technological research activities, which have powerfully promoted the all-round leap forward in various productions. Last year, the city's average grain yield per mu increased by 44.9% compared with 1958. Forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries have all achieved multiple growth.

    Wuzhong City is a town in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region where the Hui and Han ethnic groups live together. The population is relatively concentrated, arable land is scarce, farming technology is relatively backward, and agricultural output is not high. In order to fundamentally change this backward situation, in recent years, under the leadership of the Party, the Hui and Han working people of the city have worked hard to increase yield per unit area and vigorously expand the area of arable land, so that grain output has continued to grow. After the people's communes were established, with the development of industry and agricultural production, many new agricultural implements were popularized in rural areas, some machines were purchased, and it was also necessary to promote improved varieties, manufacture chemical fertilizers, raise poultry, and repair and manufacture tools, all of which required a large number of technical personnel. The establishment of the people's communes increased the need for technical personnel on the one hand, and on the other hand, due to the great superiority of the communes, it created favorable conditions for training technical personnel. The Wuzhong Municipal Committee adopted the method of relying on the masses and self-reliance to quickly train a group of agricultural science and technology personnel. These technical personnel have basically met our needs in promoting agricultural machinery, developing mechanical irrigation, and establishing small rural hydropower stations.

    Over the past year, we have gained some experience in training agricultural technical forces through self-reliance. These experiences are:

    First, combining political and ideological education with scientific and technological education. Practice over the past year has proved that the mass movement for technological innovation and technological revolution is a huge and profound ideological revolution. The mass scientific and technological team in Wuzhong City has grown stronger in the continuous struggle against various conservative ideas and habits. In response to various conservative ideas, we have adopted the "speaking, debating, and seeing" methods. "Speaking" means regularly and systematically taking various forms to conduct political and ideological education and scientific and technological education for the vast number of cadres and the masses. "Debating" means that when carrying out major technological innovations and promoting advanced experiences, mass technical debates are organized in advance to fully absorb the opinions of the masses and then promote them.

    "Seeing" means selecting typical examples, conducting experiments, and organizing observation for problems on which the masses have doubts and disagreements in their thinking, using real people and real events to educate the masses. After the vast number of cadres and the masses have been ideologically liberated, a mass scientific and technological research movement of "using science for production, talking about science everywhere, and learning science by everyone" will be widely and deeply developed.

    Second, combining popularization and improvement. In order to train scientific and technological personnel in a faster, better, and more economical way to meet production needs, we have adopted the mass line method, that is, first popularizing and then improving, combining popularization and improvement. For example, when we were engaged in motorization, the task was urgent, and there were very few iron and woodworking craftsmen, which was far from enough to meet the needs. We asked them to first learn one or two technologies, lay a preliminary foundation, and then gradually improve in the production process and develop into all-rounders. At the same time, we also often pay attention to discovering, summarizing, and improving the advanced scientific and technological experiences of the masses, and cultivating and strengthening the technical forces. Long Zhuo, a local expert in Dongta Temple, mastered the occurrence patterns of cabbage "cabbage root flies" and methods to prevent and control this pest. We immediately sent people to help him summarize and improve it theoretically and technically, and held on-site meetings to organize visits, lecturing, and practice, so that more than 360 vegetable professionals in the city learned this technology and controlled the occurrence of cabbage root fly pests. Through these production practices, we have more clearly realized that production is the source of the development of science and technology, and the working people are the direct participants in production. They have rich practical experience in production and have infinite wisdom and creativity. Only by fully utilizing the wisdom of the masses can technological revolution achieve greater success.

    Third, adopting a series of "walking on two legs" methods to train technical personnel. The first is to combine vocational schools and short-term training courses. Wuzhong City has established a junior agricultural technical school specializing in training agricultural technicians. In order to enable more people to master science and technology, we, in accordance with the spirit of "learn what you use", run training courses for whatever we do. Over the past year, the city has held 33 training courses of various types, training 2,250 technical personnel. Whether we run vocational schools or short-term training courses, we combine learning technical knowledge with participating in production practice, learning technology in the classroom, using technology in production, and improving technology in practice. Vocational schools all implement part-work and part-study, learning technology while participating in production and conducting on-site experiments, so that learning technology can be consolidated and improved.

    This year, on the basis of having already achieved water conservancy, the vast rural areas of Wuzhong City are required to basically achieve electrification and semi-mechanization. We will further take new and effective measures to train more and more highly skilled agricultural science and technology personnel to meet the needs of the new situation.

    让科学技术在农民群众中开花
    中共吴忠市委第一书记　张文林
    在1959年的持续跃进中，吴忠市的回汉族农民群众，发扬了敢想敢干的共产主义风格，积极学习各种农业科学技术，参加科学研究活动，使全市的农业科学技术队伍，日益成长壮大。目前，全市除拥有近百名高级和中级的农业技术人员外，在农村中也采取各种办法培养出农、林、牧、副、渔各个方面的初级技术人材七千一百七十六名，占全市农村劳动力总数的36．9％。一年来，他们根据农业“八字宪法”实行了农业技术改造，开展了科学技术研究活动，有力地促进了各项生产的全面大跃进，使全市去年的粮食平均亩产量比1958年提高44．9％。林、牧、副、渔都获得成倍的增长。
    吴忠市是宁夏回族自治区的一个回汉族杂居的城镇，人口比较集中，耕地少，耕作技术比较落后，农业产量不高。为了根本改变这种落后面貌，几年来，全市回汉族劳动人民在党的领导下，努力提高单位面积产量，大力扩大耕地面积，使粮食产量不断增长。人民公社化后，随着工农业生产的发展，农村中推广了不少新式农具，也购置了一些机器，同时又要推广良种，制造化肥，饲养家禽，修理和制造工具，这些都需要大批的技术人材。人民公社的成立一方面增加了技术人材的需要量，另一方面由于公社的巨大优越性，它又为培养技术人材创造了有利的条件。吴忠市委采取了依靠群众，自力更生的办法，很快地培养出一批农业科学技术人材。这些技术人材，基本上满足了我们在推广农业机械、发展机械灌溉、建立农村小型水电站等方面的需要。
    一年来，我们在自力更生培养农业技术力量方面取得了一些经验，这些经验是：
    第一、政治思想教育和科学技术教育相结合。一年来的实践证明：群众性的大闹技术革新和技术革命，是一场巨大的、深刻的思想革命。吴忠市群众性的科学技术队伍是在不断地同各种各样的保守思想和习惯势力的斗争中成长壮大起来的。针对各种各样的保守思想，我们采取了
  “讲、辩、看”的办法。“讲”就是经常有计划地采取各种形式，向广大干部和群众进行政治思想和科学技术教育。“辩”就是在开展重大的技术革新和推广先进经验时，事先组织群众性的技术辩论，充分地吸收群众的意见，然后加以推广。
  “看”就是对群众在思想上有怀疑和意见不一致的问题，选择典型，进行试验，组织观摩，以真人真事教育群众。当广大干部和群众思想解放以后，一个“生产用科学，处处讲科学，人人学科学”的群众性的科学技术研究运动将广泛深入地开展起来。
    第二、普及和提高相结合。为了多快好省地培养科学技术人材，满足生产需要，我们采取群众路线的方法，即先普及后提高，普及和提高相结合的办法。如在大闹车子化时，任务紧迫，铁木工匠很少，远远不能满足需要。我们就让他们先学会一两种技术，打下初步基础，然后在生产过程中，逐步提高，向多面手发展。同时还经常注意发现、总结和提高群众中的先进科学技术经验，培养壮大技术力量。东塔寺土专家龙卓掌握了白菜“菜根蝇”的发生规律和防治这种虫害的办法，我们立即派人帮助他从理论和技术上加以总结提高，并召开现场会议，组织参观，边看边讲边实习，使全市三百六十多名蔬菜专业人员学会了这项技术，控制了菜根蝇虫害的发生。通过这些生产实践，使我们更清楚地体会到：生产是发展科学技术的源泉，劳动人民是生产的直接参加者，他们具有丰富的生产实际经验，具有无穷的智慧和创造力。只有充分地发挥群众的智慧，才能使技术革命取得更大的成就。
    第三、采取一系列的“两条腿走路”的方法培养技术人材。首先是把专业学校和短期训练班结合起来。吴忠市举办了一所初级农业技术学校，专门培养农业技术员。为了使更多的群众掌握科学技术，我们根据
  “用什么学什么”的精神，干什么就办什么训练班。一年来，全市共办各种训练班三十三次，培训了技术人员二千二百五十人。我们不论办专业学校，还是办短期训练班，都是把学习技术知识和参加生产实践结合起来，在课堂上学技术，在生产中用技术，在实践中提高技术。专业学校都实行半耕半读，一边学习技术一边参加生产，就地实验，使学习技术能够巩固和提高。
    吴忠市广大农村，今年在已经水利化的基础上，要求基本实现电气化和半机械化。我们将进一步采取新的有效措施，培养训练更多的技术更高的农业科学技术人员，以适应新形势的需要。
