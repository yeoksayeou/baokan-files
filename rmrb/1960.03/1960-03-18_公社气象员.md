    Commune Weather Forecaster
    Yuan Hui has observed clouds and weather for decades, developing a discerning eye; decades of sweat have condensed into hundreds of agricultural proverbs. The wheels of the people's commune have brought you the spring of life; you have given the commune a loyal heart and shared your valuable experience. To irrigate the commune's seedlings, people offer their hands and shoulders; you offer accurate "intelligence" time and time again, like an outstanding scout. At the award ceremony, someone asked: Why is your "intelligence" so accurate? You said: My old eyes have gathered tens of thousands of gazes from the commune members. At the award ceremony, someone asked: What is your greatest wish? You said: May the sunshine and white clouds in the sky turn into golden mountains and silver mountains on the ground.

    公社气象员
    元辉几十年察云观天，练出一双慧眼；几十年的汗，凝成几百条农谚。人民公社的车轮，给你载来了生命的春天；你交给公社一颗赤心，也交出了宝贵的经验。为了浇灌公社的幼苗，人们献出双手和双肩；你献出的是一次次准确的“情报”，就像一个出色的侦察员。授奖大会那天，有人问：你的“情报”为啥这样灵验？你说：咱老汉这双老眼，聚拢了公社社员几万道视线。授奖大会那天，有人问：什么是你最大的心愿？你说：让天上的阳光和白云，都化成地上的金山和银山。
