Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd dispatch from Washington: While testifying before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the U.S. government's 1961 "Aid" to foreign countries plan, U.S. Secretary of State Herter emphasized the plan's "importance as a necessary instrument of our [U.S.] foreign policy," stressing that this "is first and foremost an indispensable program to protect and promote our [U.S.] interests." Herter trumpeted that the U.S. should continue to implement its policy of adhering to the "Cold War" and intensifying control and aggression against underdeveloped countries through this plan.

Herter said that the U.S. "will face an extremely important period of negotiations in the coming months," and that "this fact is certainly a hopeful sign." However, he emphasized, "this fact in itself cannot change the fundamental conflict of ideas and ideologies, nor can it give us reason to relax in any degree our efforts to protect ourselves and our friends and allies from the threat of international communism." Herter stressed the "urgent need" to strengthen America's "military strength" and to step up the arming of the member states of the aggressive military blocs established by the U.S.

Herter admitted that the current world situation is not very favorable for the U.S. He said that the "stark, basic fact" facing the U.S. is that nearly one-third of the world's population already lives in socialist countries. Herter launched a vicious attack on the socialist system, but, between the lines, he had to partially acknowledge the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. He said that the socialist camp possesses enormous manpower and material resources, "possesses tremendous military power, they are well organized, and the progress they have made in educating and developing their people is indeed remarkable. These very real strengths support and are fully utilized to advance the cause to which they are dedicated." Herter insisted that this is a threat to U.S. security, emphasizing that the U.S. cannot ignore "this powerful, crusading, dedicated force."

Herter said that another "stark, basic fact" facing the U.S. is that "outside the Communist bloc, hundreds of millions of people in the world today are struggling to escape the torment of poverty, and the people of these countries are very eager to seek the shortest and most effective way to improve their material conditions," and they face "the attraction of communism." Herter emphasized that so-called economic "aid" must be used to win over and control these countries, otherwise "it will inevitably leave them with no choice but to turn to the Communists." Herter asked the U.S. Congress to approve Eisenhower's proposed total of $4,175,000,000 for the 1961 "Mutual Security Program," saying that this "is an indispensable program to protect and promote our interests."

In answering questions from senators, Herter said that the U.S. President should hold a meeting with the British and French leaders together with Khrushchev. The U.S. "cannot risk taking the position that we are unwilling to sit down and negotiate with anyone." At the same time, Herter said that the U.S. would be attending the summit conference in a situation of "no purpose, no plan, and no hope of success." Herter described the upcoming East-West summit conference as "a kind of gamble," and said, "I frankly admit that I am not optimistic that the summit conference will achieve great results."

When talking about disarmament negotiations, Herter admitted that "the Soviet Union does want to reach some meaningful agreement." But he deliberately said that the recent attitude of the Soviet Union "is difficult to explain," insisting that "the real test lies in the stark fact of whether they are willing to reach an agreement on the inspection system."

    赫脱竭力鼓吹对外扩张
    承认美国挡不住社会主义力量的高涨
    表示无法拒绝谈判但又散布悲观论调
    据新华社23日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿赫脱22日在美国参议院外交委员会就美国政府1961年度“援”外计划作证时，强调这个计划“作为我们（美国）外交政策的必要手段的重要性”，强调这“首先是一项保护和促进我们（美国）的利益的必不可少的计划”。赫脱鼓吹美国要继续通过这个计划来执行美国的坚持“冷战”和加紧对不发达国家控制和侵略的政策。
    赫脱说，美国“在今后若干月将面临一个进行极其重要的谈判时期”，“这个事实当然是一个有希望的兆头”。但是他强调说，“这个事实本身并不能改变想法上和意识形态上的基本冲突，它也不能使我们有理由在任何程度上放松我们为了保护我们自己和我们的朋友和盟国不受国际共产主义的威胁而作的努力。”赫脱强调“迫切需要”加强美国的“军事力量”，和加紧武装美国所建立的侵略性军事集团的成员国。
    赫脱承认，目前世界形势对美国的处境来说很不美妙。他说，美国面临着的“严酷的基本事实”是世界上将近三分之一的人口已生活在社会主义国家里。赫脱对社会主义制度进行了恶毒的攻击，但是，他在字里行间却不得不部分地承认社会主义制度的无比优越性。他说，社会主义阵营拥有巨大的人力、物力，“拥有巨大的军事力量，他们组织得很好，他们在教育和发展他们的人民方面取得的进展的确是很显著的。这些很实在的力量支持着并且被充分利用来推进他们所献身的事业。”赫脱硬说这是对美国安全的一个威胁，强调美国不能忽视“这支强有力的、具有十字军精神的、抱着献身精神的力量”。
    赫脱说，美国面临的另一个“严酷的基本事实是：在共产党集团以外，今天的世界上有亿万人正在进行斗争，力求摆脱贫穷的折磨，这些国家的人民非常希望寻求最短捷、最有效的途径来改善他们的物质条件”，他们面对着“共产主义的吸引力”。赫脱强调必须用所谓经济“援助”来拉拢和控制这些国家，否则“必然会使它们没有选择余地，而只有投靠共产党人。”赫脱要求美国国会批准艾森豪威尔提出的总数达四十一亿七千五百万美元的1961年度“共同安全计划”，他说这“是一项保护和促进我们的利益的必不可少的计划”。
    赫脱在回答参议员的问题时说，美国总统应该和英法首脑一道同赫鲁晓夫举行会议。美国“不能冒险采取这样的立场：我们不愿坐下来同任何人谈判”。同时赫脱说，美国将是在“没有目的、没有计划和没有成功希望”的情况下去参加最高级会议。赫脱把将要举行的东西方最高级会议说成“是一种赌博”，并且说，“我很坦率地承认，我对于最高级会议将取得很大结果并不乐观”。
    赫脱在谈到裁军谈判问题时承认“苏联的确希望达成某种有意义的协议”。但是他又故意说苏联最近的态度“很难解释”，硬说“真正的考验在于他们是否愿意就视察制度达成协议这一严峻的事实”。
