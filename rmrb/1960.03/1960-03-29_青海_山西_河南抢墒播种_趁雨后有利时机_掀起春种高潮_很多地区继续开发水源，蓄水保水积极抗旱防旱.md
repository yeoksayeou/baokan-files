Qinghai, Shanxi, and Henan Seize Moisture for Sowing
Taking Advantage of Favorable Post-Rain Opportunity to Launch a Spring Sowing Upsurge
Many Regions Continue to Develop Water Sources, Store and Conserve Water, Actively Fight Drought and Prevent Drought

(Our report) Qinghai Province is seizing the favorable opportunity after spring rain and snow. The whole Party and all the people are mobilized, spurred on by greater effort, to further launch a campaign for seizing moisture for sowing.

From March 15th to 19th, most areas of the province experienced spring rain or snow, and some areas have already connected with the underlying soil moisture. Under this favorable situation, Party committees at all levels are grasping firmly and tightly, making emergency deployments through telephone conferences and other means, and launching a campaign to seize moisture for sowing. In Datong County, after the rainfall, leaders at all levels went deep into the fields, dividing areas for responsibility, and mobilizing the masses to carry out post-rain moisture seizing sowing. The daily sowing progress reached more than 24,000 mu, an increase of more than 30% compared to the previous daily progress of 18,000 mu. In Zeku County, all commune Party committees adopted the method of squeezing labor, seizing time, and launching assault battles to seize moisture for sowing after rain and snow.

Minhe and Ledu Counties, which have already completed the sowing of field crops, are seizing the opportunity after the rain to sow late-season crops and speed up the sowing of newly reclaimed land. Minhe County is determined to complete the sowing task of 150,000 mu of newly reclaimed land. Starting from the 20th, all people's communes in the county transferred 80% of their labor and animal power into the sowing battle, with a daily sowing progress of more than 43,000 mu. After completing the sowing of field crops on March 17th, Ledu County tightly grasped the sowing of late-season crops. After four days of concentrated sowing, it has already sown 49,957 mu of late-season crops and cash crops.

Xinhua News Agency reports: Since mid-March, various parts of Shanxi have successively experienced several snowfalls and rains. The snow and rain were heavier in the southern region and lighter further north. At present, in four counties in southern Shanxi and most counties in southeastern Shanxi, the rainwater has connected with the underground wetlands, which can guarantee the water demand for wheat regrowth and spring sowing, and the drought has been temporarily alleviated. In most other areas, the effect of these rains and snow on mitigating the drought is not significant. Therefore, the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee immediately held an emergency telephone conference on the evening of the 25th after the rain, requiring all localities to prevent the growth of blind optimism and establish a long-term drought resistance mentality, to ensure a good wheat harvest without rain, and to ensure good autumn sowing without rain, and to continue the province's drought prevention and resistance struggle until the final victory.

In northern Shanxi, on the one hand, active measures are being taken to preserve soil moisture, and on the other hand, spring irrigation is being stepped up to fight drought and spring sowing. So far, the spring irrigation area in the region has reached 2.2 million mu, an expansion of five times compared to the same period last year; 1.5 million mu of spring wheat has been sown, accounting for three-quarters of the region's plan.

(Our report) Under the circumstances that Henan Province has achieved major victories in the drought resistance struggle, since March, the province has successively received four welcome rains and auspicious snows. Except for the northern Henan area, most areas of the province have been thoroughly moistened or basically connected with moisture, which is extremely beneficial to striving for a bumper wheat harvest and completing the spring sowing task in a timely manner.

All wheat-producing areas in the province are concentrating their efforts to attack the wheat jointing stage, vowing to win a great wheat harvest. The Xuchang Special District has dispatched more than 11,000 cadres, all of whom have gone down to the production teams, adopting the approach of grasping both production and life, and launching a wheat high-yield competition movement. The entire special district strives to have one county or commune cadre responsible for leading every thousand mu of wheat field. The Xinyang Prefectural Committee requires that on the basis of the original planned output of wheat, the entire district carry out a super-production movement of fine management, skillful fertilization, prevention and elimination of all disasters, and striving for more heads, larger ears, more grains, and heavier seeds.

In accordance with the spirit of "fighting drought when there is drought, and preventing drought when there is no drought," all localities continue to vigorously build machine-operated wells, establish mechanical irrigation and drainage stations, repair field projects, add and repair water lifting tools, store and conserve water, and actively prepare for large-scale irrigation at the jointing stage. The Xinyang and Nanyang Special Districts have already stored more than 300 million cubic meters of water. The Luoyang and Xinxiang Special Districts have organized forces to conduct a general survey of soil moisture, further mobilized the masses, and continued to fight drought and irrigate wheat.

While strengthening wheat field management, all localities have focused on the preparation work for spring sowing, emphasizing base fertilizer application, re-plowing, moisture conservation, and land preparation.

    青海·山西·河南抢墒播种
    趁雨后有利时机  掀起春种高潮
    很多地区继续开发水源，蓄水保水积极抗旱防旱
    本报讯　青海省各地抓紧春雨、春雪后有利时机，全党全民动员，鼓足更大干劲，进一步开展突击抢墒播种运动。
    3月15日到19日，全省大部分地区先后降了春雨或春雪，一部分地区已经接上了底墒。在这一有利形势下，各地党委紧抓狠抓，通过电话会议等各种形式进行紧急部署，开展突击抢墒播种运动。大通县在降雨后，各级领导深入田间，划片包干，动员群众开展雨后抢墒播种。每天播种进度达到了二万四千多亩，比原来的日进度一万八千亩增加了30％以上。泽库县各公社党委都采取了挤劳力、抢时间，突击战斗的方法，在雨雪后抢墒播种。
    大田作物已经播种结束的民和、乐都等县，在雨后紧张播种晚田作物和抓紧进行新开荒地的播种工作。民和县决心完成新开荒地十五万亩的播种任务。全县各人民公社从20日开始，抽调80％的劳力、畜力投入播种战斗，每天播种进度达到四万三千亩以上。乐都县在3月17日播完大田作物后，紧抓晚田播种，经过四天突击抢种，已播晚田和经济作物四万九千九百五十七亩。
    据新华社讯　3月中旬以来山西各地陆续下过几次雪、雨，南部地区雪、雨较大，越往北雨雪越小。目前，晋南四个县和晋东南大部分县，雨水接上了地下湿地，能够保证麦田返青需水和进行春播，旱象暂时缓和，其余大部分地区，这几场雨雪对减轻旱象来说作用不大。因此中共山西省委在雨后的25日晚上马上召开了全省紧急电话会议，要求各地防止滋长盲目乐观情绪，树立长期抗旱思想，要作到无雨保小麦丰收，无雨保秋田种好，把全省的防旱抗旱斗争一直持续到最后胜利。
    晋北地区一方面积极采取保墒措施，一方面大抓春浇加紧抗旱春种，到目前为止，全区春浇面积达二百二十万亩，比去年同时扩大了五倍；已播种春麦一百五十万亩，占全区计划的四分之三。
    本报讯　河南省在抗旱斗争取得重大胜利的情况下，3月份以来，全省接连降了四次喜雨、瑞雪，除豫北地区以外，全省大部分地区已经透墒或基本接墒，这对争取小麦丰收，为适时完成春播任务极为有利。
    全省各小麦产区，正集中力量猛攻小麦拔节关，誓夺小麦大丰收。许昌专区共派出干部一万一千余名，全部下到生产队，采取生产生活一齐抓，大搞小麦丰产竞赛运动。全专区力争作到每千亩麦田有一名县、社干部负责领导。信阳地委要求在小麦原计划产量的基础上，全区开展了精管理，巧施肥，防止和消灭一切灾害，力争头多、穗大、粒多、籽重的超产运动。
    各地根据“有旱抗旱，无旱防旱”的精神，继续大搞机井方、建立机械排灌站，整修田间工程，增添和修理提水工具，蓄水保水，积极作好大浇拔节水的准备工作。信阳、南阳两专区已蓄水三亿多公方。洛阳、新乡等专区组织力量，普查墒情，进一步发动了群众，继续抗旱浇麦。
    在加强麦田管理的同时，各地对春播准备工作，突出抓住了施底肥、复耕、保墒、整地等工作。
