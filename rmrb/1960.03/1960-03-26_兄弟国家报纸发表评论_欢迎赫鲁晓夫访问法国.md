Xinhua News Agency, March 24th – Newspapers in Asian and Eastern European brotherly countries published editorials, commentaries, or articles on the 23rd and 24th, welcoming Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev's visit to France.

    Korean "Rodong Sinmun's" commentary stated that Khrushchev's visit will bring beneficial results to the improvement of Soviet-French relations and to the easing of tensions in Europe. It now depends on what degree of realistic attitude the French government will take in improving Soviet-French relations and in maintaining European peace.

    Mongolian "Unen" published an editorial on the 24th stating that Khrushchev's visit will not only have historical significance for the sound development of Soviet-French relations, but will also make new contributions to the further consolidation of the peaceful development of international relations.

    Czechoslovakian "Rudé Právo's" editorial expressed hope that the talks between the leaders of the Soviet Union and France will help strengthen European security and the resolution of the German question.

    Hungarian "Népszabadság's" article stated that the improvement of Soviet-French relations is of great significance not only for the security of France, but also for the security of Europe. The article pointed out, however, that the French government has shown itself to be in contradiction with this friendly policy on more than one issue, such as the French government's support for Adenauer.

    Bulgarian "Rabotnichesko Delo's" editorial pointed out that Khrushchev's visit to France is another manifestation of the Soviet Union's love of peace and commitment to preventing new world conflicts.

    Albanian "Zëri i Popullit's" commentary pointed out that the meeting between Khrushchev and de Gaulle will not only be conducive to the further consolidation of relations between the peoples of the Soviet Union and France, but will also be conducive to the cause of peace.

    兄弟国家报纸发表评论
    欢迎赫鲁晓夫访问法国
    据新华社24日讯　亚洲和东欧兄弟国家的报纸23日和24日相继发表社论、评论或文章，欢迎苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫访问法国。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”的评论说，赫鲁晓夫的访问将为改善苏法两国间的关系和为缓和欧洲紧张局势带来有益的结果。现在要看法国政府在改善苏法两国关系和为维护欧洲和平方面，将采取何种程度的现实态度。
    蒙古“真理报”24日发表社论说，赫鲁晓夫的访问不仅对苏法两国关系的良好发展会有历史意义，而且将对进一步巩固国际关系的和平发展作出新的贡献。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”的社论表示希望苏法两国领导人的会谈将有助于加强欧洲的安全和德国问题的解决。
    匈牙利“人民自由报”的文章说，苏法两国关系的改进不仅对法国的安全，而且对欧洲的安全，都具有重要的意义。文章指出，但是，法国政府在不止一个问题上表现同这个友好的政策背道而驰，如法国政府对阿登纳的支持等。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”的社论指出，赫鲁晓夫访问法国是苏联爱好和平和致力于防止新的世界冲突的又一表现。
    阿尔巴尼亚“团结报”的评论指出，赫鲁晓夫和戴高乐的会见将不仅有利于苏法两国人民之间的关系的进一步巩固，同时将有利于和平事业。
