Stepping Out of the Office to Directly Organize and Promote Technological Innovation
Shanghai Railway Bureau's Financial Work Closely Serves Production

(Our Shanghai dispatch on March 19th) How can enterprise financial departments serve the high-speed development of production? The Shanghai Railway Bureau has provided relatively good experience in this regard. The financial personnel of this bureau have overcome purely business viewpoints, closely focusing on the party's central work, serving production needs in everything, vigorously carrying out mass movements, making financial work lively and colorful, and powerfully guaranteeing and promoting the high-speed development of railway transportation. Last year, this bureau completed its annual freight and passenger transport tasks fifteen and sixty-eight days ahead of schedule, respectively; transportation costs were reduced by 12.6% compared to 1958, and labor productivity increased by 11%, achieving an all-round great leap forward. In the first two months of this year, their passenger and freight volumes increased by more than 20% compared to the same period last year.

The Shanghai Railway Bureau leads railway transportation work in Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and parts of Anhui. In 1959, industrial and agricultural production continued to leap forward, placing heavy tasks on the railway departments. Shanghai is also one of China's major industrial bases, with a large volume of freight traffic. Under the circumstances of more goods and fewer trains, and a relatively prominent contradiction between transportation volume and capacity, the Party committee of this bureau, based on the characteristic of more unloading than loading within its jurisdiction, vigorously carried out a mass movement centered on unloading to improve transportation efficiency. Financial personnel conscientiously implemented the principle of serving the Party's central work. Whatever central task the Party committee proposed during this period, they cooperated in carrying out this work, playing a positive role in completing the transportation task in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

Last September, after the Party committee of the Shanghai Railway Bureau issued the call for "fast loading and unloading not exceeding one hour," railway financial personnel in the Huainan area first launched a movement to quickly issue freight bills. They stepped out of the office and engaged in close cooperation with weighing and loading/unloading personnel, adopting a new method of issuing tickets at the side of the train. In the past, the time it took to load a train with coal was only twenty minutes, but the procedure for issuing freight bills took an hour; the implementation of this method ensured that trains left ahead of schedule. Later, a competition to ensure "trains not waiting for tickets" was launched in various stations. Financial personnel offered suggestions and strategies, and in addition to issuing tickets at the side of the train, they also implemented methods such as issuing tickets at the warehouse, issuing tickets at the factory, issuing tickets before calculating fees, and using telephone notifications to the forward station of the train to issue tickets, creating favorable conditions for early departure and rapid operation, and also ensuring the correct delivery of consigned goods. During a period when a large number of goods arrived at the station, the Party committee focused on the work of dispatching goods. Financial personnel also launched a competition to organize the dispatch of goods. The financial department of Shanghai East Station, aiming at the key problem of the station's large volume of less-than-carload (LCL) freight arrivals and the dispersed nature of the receiving units, mobilized everyone to dispatch goods. Before the goods were transported from other places and unloaded, they would check the freight bills and take the initiative to deliver the goods to the receiving units. For some addresses that were unclear, they would inquire in various ways to find out the address. After taking the initiative in mastering the work of dispatching goods, the backlog of LCL freight at the station was quickly reduced by half, which not only avoided congestion in the station's freight yard, but also enabled the goods to be put into circulation and production in a timely manner. In the vigorous movement of skillful loading and full loading, financial personnel tried their best to organize piggyback transportation. They made full use of the information provided by the freight vouchers, cooperated closely with the loading personnel, and adopted the method of combining light and heavy goods, squeezing the cargo into any available space in the wagon and plugging any gaps to increase the load capacity. Last year, the bureau transported 2.86 million tons of goods by piggybacking, an increase of 300 times compared to 1958.

Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, the financial personnel of the Shanghai Railway Bureau vigorously promoted mass accounting, using it as a tool to serve the Party's central work. At present, more than 1,000 teams and groups in the bureau have established a mass accounting system. It is playing a relatively significant role in promoting the current technological innovation and technological revolution movement. The indicators of mass accounting are formulated according to the labor characteristics of each team, group, and type of work. These indicators reflect the requirements of technological innovation. Through daily accounting, bookkeeping, analysis, and comparison, it can be seen the progress of the innovation activities of each team and group, the actual results achieved, the economic effects, and the innovation projects that have not yet been completed. After the workers participate in accounting, they can know their contribution to the country at any time, and the sense of responsibility as masters of their own affairs is greatly strengthened, taking the initiative to find the key problems in production, and vigorously carry out technological innovation. The leadership also promptly understands the dynamics of each team and group in the movement, and further proposes topics, organizes and promotes technological innovation, targeting weak links.

An important practice of this bureau in vigorously carrying out mass accounting and promoting technological innovation and technological revolution is to combine accounting analysis and technical dissection. Financial personnel have played an active role in promoting and organizing this. There is a steep slope section of track outside Hepingmen in Nanjing. Generally, locomotives struggled to climb the slope even with sufficient coal and steam, affecting the traction of the locomotive. The drivers called it "Devil's Gate." The Party committee of the Nanjing Locomotive Depot was very concerned about this issue. Financial personnel analyzed and compared the data from the group accounting and found that Locomotive No. 659 could smoothly climb this steep slope. After they made a special report on this situation to the Party committee of the depot, the Party committee secretary personally took charge, organizing leaders, technicians, and veteran workers to hold an on-site meeting next to this locomotive. They dissected Locomotive No. 659 on the spot and found that a major feature of its technical structure was that the frame was low in the front and high in the back, like a rabbit, so it had great climbing power and also great momentum. Some technicians were skeptical. The Party committee also dissected Locomotive No. 635, which consumed more coal and steam, and modified it according to the structure of Locomotive No. 659. Locomotive No. 635 successfully passed the steep slope, and the consumption of water and coal was also reduced. Therefore, the Party committee carried out technical modifications to all locomotives of the same type. The Nanjing Locomotive Depot transported an additional 600,000 tons of goods last year as a result. The Party committee of the locomotive depot praised the financial accounting work as its eyes and ears.

The financial personnel of this bureau seize every opportunity to serve the Party's central work. They have gone from caring about production to caring about the lives of workers, doing many things that were not originally within their scope of responsibilities. In Hangzhou, a financial person in charge of attendance jumped out of the circle of simply marking "8" (eight hours). Starting from how to improve labor productivity, they took the initiative to find doctors to prevent and treat occupational diseases for workers, and helped families arrange their lives, so that employees could rest peacefully. As a result, the sick leave rate was reduced by 80%.

In order to promptly promote the advanced experience of financial work serving production, the Shanghai Railway Bureau frequently holds on-site financial meetings. The characteristic of this type of meeting is that not only financial personnel participate, but also grassroots leaders, foremen, and workers attend. In fact, it expands into a "three-way combination" production promotion meeting. From November 10th to the end of the year last year, they held this type of meeting from Nanjing to Hangzhou and then to Shanghai in the space of fifty days. The experience introduced at the meeting ranged from workshops and teams to individuals; from production to life; from mass accounting to professional accounting, developing the exchange of financial accounting experience to the exchange of experience in achieving high-speed transportation. Through this type of meeting, not only was the experience matched into sets, but it also promoted the in-depth development of the competition of comparison, learning, catching up, and helping. Financial personnel further clarified that financial work must serve the direction of production, and strengthened their confidence that they must vigorously carry out mass movements; the workers also more deeply realized the positive significance of accounting for carrying out production in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

    走出办公室直接组织和推动技术革新
    上海铁路总局财务工作紧紧服务生产
    本报上海19日电　企业财务部门如何为高速度发展生产服务？上海铁路总局在这方面提供了比较好的经验。这个局的财务人员克服单纯业务观点，紧紧围绕党的中心工作，事事服务于生产需要，大搞群众运动，把财务工作做得生动活泼、有声有色，有力地保证和促进了铁路运输的高速度发展。去年这个局分别提前十五天和六十八天完成全年的货运和客运任务；运输成本比1958年降低12．6％，劳动生产率提高11％，实现了全面大跃进。今年头两个月，他们的客货运量又比去年同期增长20％以上。
    上海铁路总局领导上海、江苏、浙江以及安徽境内一部分的铁路运输工作。1959年工农业生产继续大跃进，向铁路部门提出了繁重的任务，上海又是我国主要工业基地之一，货物吞吐量很大。在货多车少、运量与运力矛盾比较突出的情况下，这个局的党委根据管辖范围内卸车多于装车这一特点，大搞以卸车为中心的群众运动，来提高运输效率。财务人员认真执行为党的中心工作服务这一方针。党委这个时期提出什么中心任务，他们就配合开展这个工作，对多快好省地完成运输任务起了积极的促进作用。
    去年9月份，上海铁路总局党委提出“快装快卸不超过一小时”的号召后，淮南地区的铁路财务人员首先展开快速开货票的运动。他们走出办公室，和司磅、装卸人员搞大协作，采取了车边开票的新办法。过去每一列车装煤时间只需二十分钟，而开货票的手续却要一小时；实行这一办法就保证了提前开车。以后各个车站都掀起了“车不等票”的竞赛热潮，财务人员纷纷献计献策，除了在车边开票以外，又实行到仓库开票，到工厂开票、先开票后计费，以及用电话通知列车的前方车站开票等许多办法，为提前开车、快速运行创造了有利条件，也保证了托运货物的正确投送。有一段时期，车站到货很多，党委大抓出货工作。财务人员也展开了组织出货的竞赛。上海东站的财务部门针对这个站零担货物到达量大，收货单位分散的关键问题，发动人人搞出货。他们在货物从外地运到尚未卸车前，就去查看货票，主动把货送给收货单位，有些地址不明的就多方探询，查明地址。掌握出货工作的主动权后，积压在车站的零担货物迅速减少一半，既避免了车站货场的堵塞，又使货物及时投入流通和生产。在大搞巧装满载运动中，财务人员尽力组织捎脚运输。他们充分利用运货凭证提供的资料，与装车人员密切配合，采取轻重货物拼装的方法，车皮中有空就挤，有缝就塞，提高载重量。这个局去年利用捎脚办法多运了二百八十六万吨货物，比1958年增加三百倍。
    上海铁路总局的财务人员在党委统一领导下，大力推行群众核算，以此作为工具来为党的中心工作服务。目前全局一千多个班组都建立了群众核算的制度。在当前正在开展的技术革新和技术革命运动中，起着比较显著的促进作用。群众核算的指标是根据各个班组、工种的劳动特点制定的。这些指标反映了技术革新的要求。通过日常的核算、记账、分析和比较，可以看出各个班组革新活动的情况、完成的实绩、经济效果和尚未完成的革新项目。工人们参加核算后，能够随时知道自己对国家的贡献，主人翁的责任感就大大加强，主动找出生产中的关键问题，大闹技术革新。领导方面也及时了解运动中各班组的动态，针对薄弱环节，进一步出课题，组织和推动技术革新。
    这个局大搞群众核算，促进技术革新和技术革命的一个重要做法，是把核算分析和技术解剖结合起来。财务人员在这里面起了积极的推动、组织作用。南京和平门外有一段高坡线路，一般机车加足了煤、烧足了气，爬坡仍很困难，影响了机车的拉力，司机们都叫它“鬼门关”。南京机务段党委十分关心这个问题。财务人员根据小组核算的资料，分析对比，发现659号机车能够顺利地爬过这段高坡。他们把这情况向段党委作了专题汇报后，党委书记亲自挂帅，组织领导人员、技术人员和老工人到这台机车旁边开现场会议，当场解剖了659机车，发现它在技术构造上的一个主要特点是车架前低后高，像个兔子，所以爬力大，冲力也大。部分技术人员将信将疑。党委又对费煤费气较多的635号机车进行解剖，并按照659号机车的结构进行改装。635号机车果然顺利通过高坡，耗水耗煤也减少了。于是党委把所有同类型的机车全部进行技术改造，南京机务段去年因此多拉了六十万吨货物。机务段党委夸奖财务核算工作是它的耳目。
    这个局的财务人员抓住一切机会为党的中心工作服务，已经从关心生产进而关心工人生活，做了不少原来不属于他们职责范围的事情。杭州有个担任考勤的财务人员，跳出单纯划划“8”字（八小时）的圈子，从如何提高劳动生产率着眼，主动找医师给工人防治职业病，帮助家属安排生活，让职工安心休息，病假率因此减少80％。
    为了及时推广财务工作服务生产的先进经验，上海铁路总局经常召开财务现场会议。这种会议的特点是不但有财务人员参加，也有基层领导人员、工长和工人出席，实际上扩大成为“三结合”的生产促进会议。去年11月10日到年底的五十天内，他们把这种会议由南京开到杭州又开到上海。会上介绍的经验，从车间、班组到个人；从生产到生活；从群众核算到专业核算，把交流财务核算经验发展到交流实现运输高速度的经验。通过这种会议，不但使经验配成套，也促进了比、学、赶、帮竞赛的深入开展。财务人员更加明确了财务工作必须为生产服务的方向，坚定了必须大搞群众运动的信心；工人们也更加深刻地体会到核算对于多快好省进行生产的积极意义。
