    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow. The Soviet steel industry, which is rapidly catching up with the United States, and the iron ore mining industry, which already surpasses the United States, will further ascend to new heights this year. According to the state plan, this year the production of these two industrial sectors in the Soviet Union will increase to: 47 million tons of pig iron, approximately 65 million tons of steel, over 50.2 million tons of steel products, and 105 million tons of iron ore. To accommodate the development of production, the scale of capital construction in these two industrial sectors will also be greatly expanded. The state stipulates that the majority of construction projects to be completed and put into operation this year have already begun intensive construction.
    According to the TASS news agency, the Soviet State Planning Committee has announced that the following are planned to be completed and put into operation this year in the Soviet steel and iron ore industries: five large blast furnaces, ten open-hearth furnaces, three electric steel furnaces, six large rolling mills, and numerous new mines, mining pits, and ore dressing enterprises. Currently, all ten open-hearth furnaces have started construction. Of the five blast furnaces, two were laid the foundation last year, and the remaining three also started construction recently. In terms of rolling mill construction, a giant steel plate rolling mill is currently being built at the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works in the Urals, which will roll steel plates as wide as 2.5 meters for the first time in the Soviet Union. The construction of another large steel plate rolling mill at the Zhdanov Iron and Steel Works in Ukraine is also proceeding intensely. Thanks to the potential of the builders and the accelerated construction speed, the construction period of this steel plate rolling mill will be shortened from the originally planned twenty-three months to one year and put into operation at the end of this year.
    This year, the construction scale and the new production capacity put into operation in the Soviet steel and iron ore industries both exceed those of previous years. The total production capacity of the rolling mills to be completed and put into operation this year will reach 5 million tons. The total production capacity of the planned open-hearth furnaces will be nearly 20% more than the new open-hearth furnaces put into operation last year, some of which will be the largest open-hearth furnaces in the world. The five giant blast furnaces to be completed this year will produce several million tons of pig iron annually. Together with the blast furnaces completed last year, the Soviet Union will put a total of ten new blast furnaces into production within two years. This is the first time in the history of Soviet blast furnace construction that so many blast furnaces have been completed in two years. In terms of iron ore enterprise construction, the total production capacity of the new mining pits, mines, and ore dressing complexes to be completed and put into operation this year in the Soviet Union will reach 31 million tons, which also breaks the highest record in the history of Soviet iron ore industrial enterprise construction.
    This year, the eastern region remains the key area for Soviet steel industry construction. Half of the open-hearth furnaces planned to be built this year will be constructed in the three iron and steel complexes of Magnitogorsk, Nizhny Tagil, and Orsk-Khalilovo in the Urals. Three of the blast furnaces planned to be put into operation will also be built in the eastern region. In terms of iron ore mining industry construction, the iron ore mining base in the Ukrainian Republic will continue to be expanded further. More than half of the new enterprises' production capacity planned to be put into operation this year (18.5 million tons) will be concentrated here. The Kursk iron ore region of the Russian Federation will be the second key area for iron ore enterprise construction. Currently, two large iron mines with a yield of 4 million tons are being built here. In addition, some new mining enterprises will also be built in Kazakhstan, Western Siberia, and the Urals this year. The Kachkanarsky ore dressing complex, which recently began construction in the Urals, will be one of the largest ore dressing enterprises in the Soviet Union.

    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow. According to the Soviet "Construction News," approximately three hundred new chemical industrial enterprises and construction projects will be completed and put into operation in the Soviet Union this year. In order to strive for the early completion of these construction projects, construction workers from the Kuibyshev and Sterlitamak synthetic rubber factories recently launched a socialist emulation campaign.
    Currently, this campaign has spread to many chemical industrial construction sites across the country. More and more construction trusts and construction workers in economic zones have joined this competition.
    In order to realize the construction tasks of the chemical industry, the Soviet Union's investment in basic construction for this industrial sector this year will be more than 30% higher than the actual investment last year and more than double that in 1958. Of the approximately three hundred industrial enterprises and construction projects planned to be completed and put into operation, about two-thirds are being built in the Russian Federation Republic, and more than 17% are distributed in the Ukrainian Republic. Among them, fifty are key projects of the Soviet Union this year, including some enterprises with particularly important national economic significance.
    The chemical industry is currently a sector that the Soviet Union is particularly focusing on developing. Compared with 1958, the amount of construction and installation work completed by construction workers of Soviet chemical industrial enterprises increased by 63% last year, and the construction speed greatly exceeded that of other industrial sectors. Within one year, new factories were put into production in the Gorky, Sverdlovsk, Dnepropetrovsk, Stalino and other economic zones, including plastic factories, asphalt factories, and synthetic material factories. Some synthetic rubber factories were also built in the Azerbaijan and Armenia economic zones. The artificial fiber enterprises put into production last year in Krasnoyarsk, Kiev, Minsk, Moscow, and other places have a total annual output sufficient to make 40 million pieces of clothing.

    苏联钢铁和化学工业向新高峰迈进
    今年的建设规模和新生产能力都超过往年
    新华社莫斯科电　正在猛追美国的苏联钢铁工业和已占美国上风的铁矿开采工业，今年将进一步登上新的高峰。根据国家计划，今年苏联这两个工业部门的生产将增加到：生铁四千七百万吨，钢六千五百万吨左右，钢材五千零二十万吨以上，铁矿砂一亿零五百万吨。适应生产的发展，这两个工业部门的基本建设规模也将大大扩大，国家规定建成并在今年投入生产的绝大部分建设工程，现在都已开始紧张施工。
    据塔斯社记者从苏联国家计划委员会获悉，今年苏联钢铁工业和铁矿工业中计划建成和投入生产的计有：五座大型高炉，十座平炉，三座炼钢电炉，六座大型轧钢机和不少新的矿山、矿井和选矿企业。目前，这十座平炉已经全部动工建设，五座高炉中，有两座在去年就已奠基，其余三座也在最近开始施工。在轧钢机建设方面，目前正在乌拉尔的马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁联合工厂加紧建设一台巨型钢板轧机，它将在苏联第一次轧制宽达二点五米的钢板。另一座正在乌克兰的日丹诺夫钢铁工厂建设的大型钢板轧机的工程，现在也在紧张进行。由于建设者发挥潜力，加快建设速度，这座钢板轧机的建筑期限将由原计划的二十三个月缩短为一年，而在今年年底投入生产。
    今年苏联钢铁工业和铁矿工业的建设规模和投入生产的新生产能力，都超过往年。今年建成和投入生产的轧钢机的总生产能力将达五百万吨，计划建成的平炉的总生产能力将比去年投入生产的新平炉多将近20％，其中有几座将是世界上最大的平炉。今年建成的五座巨型高炉每年总共将生产几百万吨生铁，连同去年建成的高炉计算在一起，两年之内苏联总共将使十座新高炉投入生产。在苏联高炉建设史上，在两年之内建成这么多高炉，这还是第一次。在铁矿企业建设方面，今年苏联建成和投入生产的新矿井、矿山和选矿联合企业的总生产能力将达三千一百万吨，这也打破了苏联铁矿工业企业建设史上的最高纪录。
    今年，东部地区仍然是苏联钢铁工业建设的重点地区。今年计划建设的平炉中，有一半将建设在乌拉尔的马格尼托哥尔斯克、下塔吉尔和奥尔斯克—哈洛夫斯克三个钢铁联合工厂。计划投入生产的高炉中，有三座也建设在东部地区。在铁矿开采工业建设方面，首先将继续进一步扩大乌克兰共和国的铁矿开采基地。计划在今年投入生产的新企业的生产能力中，有一半以上（一千八百五十万吨）将集中在这里。俄罗斯联邦的库尔斯克铁矿区将是铁矿企业建设的第二个重点地区，目前这里正在建设两个产量达四百万吨的大型铁矿。此外，在哈萨克、西西伯利亚和乌拉尔，今年也将兴建一些新的采矿企业。最近在乌拉尔开始建设的卡契卡纳尔斯克选矿联合企业，将是苏联最大的选矿企业之一。
    新华社莫斯科电　据苏联“建筑报”报道，今年苏联将有大约三百个新的化学工业企业和工程项目建成和投入生产。为了争取提前完成这些建筑工程，不久前古比雪夫和斯捷尔里塔曼斯克两个合成橡胶工厂的建筑工人发起了社会主义竞赛运动。
    目前这一运动已扩展到全国许多化学工业建筑工地。越来越多的建筑托辣斯和经济区的建筑工作者投入了这个竞赛。
    为了实现化学工业的建设任务，苏联今年用于这一工业部门的基本建设投资，将比去年的实际投资多30％以上，比1958年多一倍多。在计划建成和投入生产的约三百个工业企业和工程项目中，有大约三分之二建设在俄罗斯联邦共和国，17％以上分布在乌克兰共和国。其中，有五十个是苏联今年的重点工程，包括一些具有特别重要的国民经济意义的企业。
    化学工业是目前苏联特别着重发展的一个工业部门。和1958年比较，去年苏联化学工业企业建筑工人所完成的建筑安装工作量增加了63％，建设速度大大超过了其他工业部门。一年之内，在高尔基、斯维德洛夫斯克、第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克、斯大林诺等经济区都有新的工厂投入生产，其中包括塑料工厂、沥青工厂和合成材料工厂。在阿塞拜疆和亚美尼亚经济区，还建成一些合成橡胶工厂。去年在克拉斯诺雅尔斯克、基辅、明斯克、莫斯科等地投入生产的人造纤维企业，其年总产量足够制作四千万件衣服。
