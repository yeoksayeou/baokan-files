It is imperative that technological innovation and revolution drive the comprehensive leap forward in enterprise work. Departments are an important component of enterprises, and the continuous leap forward in work efficiency and management level is imperative.

At times, the work of departments may lag behind the development of the situation, especially after the level of mechanization and automation has been improved. Work in areas such as planning, statistics, design, and material supply often falls behind, which should be promptly noted.

For departmental work to quickly catch up with workshop production, it is only necessary to promptly discover problems in departmental work and boldly innovate in order to quickly adapt to production requirements. The vigorous reform of enterprise management at the Changchun Automobile Parts Factory is a good example. This factory vigorously carried out technological innovation, and the production capacity of molds more than doubled. At this time, the design capacity of the department was only 50% of the production capacity, and the design work lagged behind. However, when the factory's Party committee proposed a mass movement to vigorously reform the work of the department, a new parallel, standardized, and serialized design method appeared; in an instant, design efficiency increased thirty to forty times.

To narrow the gap between departmental work and workshop production, it is necessary to rely on the leadership of the Party, launch a mass movement, and fully mobilize the subjective initiative of departmental personnel.

The technological revolution is a comprehensive and profound revolution in the development of productive forces. It brings not only a great liberation of productive forces, but also inevitably brings great changes in mental outlook, a great upsurge in science and culture, and a great improvement in enterprise management and departmental work. And carrying out a major reform of departmental work, improving the work efficiency and management level of departments, is an important aspect of this revolutionary movement.

    势在必行
    技术革新和技术革命带动了企业工作的全面跃进。科室是企业的重要组成部分，工作效率和管理水平的不断跃进，这是势在必行。
    在某些时候，科室工作会出现跟不上形势发展的现象，特别是在机械化、自动化的水平提高以后，计划、统计、设计、调度、材料供应等方面的工作往往落后一步，这是应当及时引起注意的。
    科室工作迅速赶上车间生产，只要及时发觉科室工作中的问题，大胆革新，就能很快的适应生产的要求。长春汽车配件厂大力改革企业管理就是一个很好的例子。这个厂大搞技术革新，模具的生产能力一下就提高了一倍多。这时，科室的设计能力只及生产能力的50％，设计工作落后了。可是，当这个厂的党委提出大搞群众运动，大力改革科室工作的号召以后，一种新的平行、标准、系列化的设计方法出现了；转瞬之间，设计效率提高了三十到四十倍。
    缩小科室工作和车间生产之间的距离，就要依靠党的领导，大搞群众运动，充分发挥科室人员的主观能动性。
    技术革命，是一场全面深刻的发展生产力的革命。它带来的不仅仅是生产力的大解放，同时也必然带来思想面貌的大变化，带来科学文化的大高涨，带来企业管理、科室工作的大提高。而进行科室工作的大改革，提高科室的工作效率和管理水平，就是这场革命运动中的一个重要方面。
