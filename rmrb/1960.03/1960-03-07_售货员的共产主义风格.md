     Salesperson's Communist Style
     Wei Shuqin, Student of the Philosophy Group of the 7th Department Store of Harbin, Salesperson
    The era of "a store is just for buying and selling" and "a salesperson is just for selling goods" has passed. The meaning of "store" and "salesperson" has new content. The new fashion of "taking the store as home" and "taking customers as friends" is developing vigorously.
    Since the Great Leap Forward, there have been more customers in our business hall. "Even if you don't buy anything, come and take a look," every new product attracts customers. Whenever I introduce a new product of our motherland to customers, I always feel infinite happiness and pride when I see their satisfied smiles in front of the counter. I deeply feel that not only should I do a good job in sales, but also do a good job in publicity, so that every customer who comes here can feel the infinite greatness of the Party, the motherland is thriving, and the future is infinitely broad and beautiful.
    The work of a salesperson is carried out in front of millions of customers. A salesperson's good labor attitude will make people feel happy and joyful, and reflect the new relationship between people in a socialist country. Conversely, a salesperson's bad labor attitude will have a very bad impact. Only when a salesperson recognizes his own role and task and its impact can he treat his labor more correctly. For this reason, it is now necessary for us to study the issue of the salesperson's communist style. Salespeople should have a firm proletarian world view and establish a noble communist style that is loyal to the people. What is a communist style? In what aspects is the communist style reflected in specific work? This is what I want to discuss in this article. However, due to my lack of work experience and low cultural and theoretical level, it is difficult to achieve the purpose of research; moreover, the topic of communist style is very large, and the salesperson's business activities are very complex, so it is even more difficult to talk about it well. Now I will only write down my own superficial views for everyone to discuss.
      Be a Loyal Servant of the People
    In socialist society, everyone has a certain social position. As long as this position is beneficial to the proletarian cause and the people, then the work he is engaged in is work to serve the people. As for the different types of work, that is just different social divisions of labor. Workers and farmers directly create product value. Salespeople do not directly create product value, but send the products created by workers and farmers to consumers. The quality of the salesperson's service depends on the quality of the salesperson's labor viewpoint, that is, whether there is a communist labor attitude, whether it is to serve the interests of the broad masses of the people, and whether everything is considered for the interests of the broad masses of the people and for the socialist cause. Now let us talk about it separately:
    First, the issue of labor viewpoint in the service process. A salesperson standing in front of a counter is different from a worker standing next to a machine. A salesperson standing in front of a counter can receive hundreds of customers a day, or dozens, or even just a few customers can complete the work of the day perfectly, because the number of customers received by a salesperson cannot be stipulated by a quota like workers in a factory. Workers must ensure product quality in the production process, but the service quality of salespeople is very flexible and often cannot be measured by technical appraisal. For example, a salesperson can take out four items for the customer to look at at a time, but taking out two items is also fine; four or five customers can be received at the same time, but receiving them one by one is also fine. Because of this, to be a good salesperson, you must have a strong conscious labor viewpoint and regard your work as a noble and glorious responsibility. For example, in the past, salespeople only sold goods; during the rectification movement, comrades generally improved their political and ideological awareness and actively proposed the slogan of "one member becoming many members," not only as salespeople, but also as Party policy propagandists, salespersons, purchasers, and managers. Even picking up and delivering goods was done by the salespeople themselves, and some even became cart-pulling experts and transportation shock brigade members. This positive attitude is a communist labor attitude. The opposite is "choosing the easy and avoiding the difficult, pushing the heavy burden to others and choosing the light one for oneself. When something comes up, first consider oneself and then consider others." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume II, page 653) This is not a communist labor attitude and is what we must oppose.
    Second, labor should benefit the people. In the old society, labor was for personal food. Today, labor is for the greater and greater happiness of the collective, for the benefit of the proletarian cause, and for the benefit of the people. In the old society, shop assistants were for the capitalists, and the store was owned by the capitalists. Today, the store is our own, so we must first establish the idea of taking the store as home. Some comrades are diligent and conscientious in their work. They manage the store in an orderly manner and consider everything for the store, because they realize that the store belongs to the people and the country. The country and the people have entrusted us with the highest trust by giving us so much money and materials to master and manage.
    As the master of the country, we must first establish the idea of doing everything for the country, regarding the affairs of the store as our own, placing the interests of the Party above personal interests, and enduring hardship before enjoying pleasure. We must be like what Chairman Mao told us to be, "a noble person, a pure person, a moral person, a person who has broken away from vulgar interests, and a person who is beneficial to the people." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume II, page 654)
      Serving Production and Serving Consumption
    Above, we talked about the salesperson's work itself being service. Then, who do we serve? How can service be considered a communist service viewpoint? Let's discuss them separately.
    1. Industry and commerce as one family. Production is for consumption, consumption requires production, consumption can promote expanded reproduction, and the purpose of reproduction is to better meet the growing consumer needs. Therefore, production and consumption are two organically unified parts. This unified relationship works through commerce, so commerce is called a "bridge" and a "link." Commerce is the sales department. The production department relies on the better sales of the sales department to expand reproduction, and the sales department relies on the better production of the production department to meet its own sales needs. Therefore, the two are mutually dependent and mutually restrictive; production is for consumption, and the sales department also serves consumption, and the goal is the same. After the Great Leap Forward, in order to better help salespeople understand and master the performance of goods, factories sent production technicians to stores to explain product knowledge and its production process to salespeople, and many salespeople also took old workers from factories as their masters. Under the enthusiastic guidance of these masters, they became all-rounders on the commercial front, not only mastering the performance of goods and understanding the operating procedures, but also learning drawing, trial production, and repair. In order to make the goods produced by industry more suitable for consumption needs, the commercial front salespeople always reflect their opinions to the production department at any time and place in their work, which has promoted the improvement of commodity production. This close combination of industry and commerce has become a common new fashion.
    In addition, goods entering factories, goods getting off the train, and goods going to the fields have become common phenomena. Even "night delivery" and "delivery at any time" and other examples that proceed from the needs of convenient production are also numerous. In short, all of these reflect a communist style. Those purely departmental viewpoints that do not proceed from production and do not proceed from the overall situation are all wrong.
    2. Taking customers as friends. The service object of salespeople is the broad masses of the people. Whether they are from the city or from the countryside, whether they are workers, farmers, cadres, students, residents, etc., they all appear in front of salespeople as customers. Salespeople must treat the vast number of customers from all aspects with the same enthusiasm, and must not treat people with a cold attitude just because some customers do not buy anything and just come to take a look.
    Because of needs, there are sales, and doing everything possible to expand the source of goods is precisely to do everything possible to meet needs. Therefore, expanding sales and meeting needs are dialectically unified. Therefore, it is also very natural for salespeople and customers to form close friendships. Every salesperson must regard the needs of customers as their own business and be able to understand the psychology of customers. When customers have not bought the goods they need, salespeople should deeply feel that they have not fulfilled their responsibilities.
    When customers have difficulties, salespeople always try their best to find ways to help solve them. For example, when they hear customers say that they do not have time to come to the store to buy goods, they write down the goods that customers need and use their personal rest time to deliver the goods to the customer's home. For example, some customers came to the store to buy a certain item they needed, and it happened that our store sold out. What to do? The customer is waiting to use it and does not know where to find it. At this time, the salesperson will contact him everywhere, contact him and tell him to go buy it. For example, some customers were troubled because they had foot problems and had not worn shoes that they liked for several years. When our salesperson knew about it, they spent a lot of effort to make a pair for the customer, satisfying the need. The customer said happily, "This time I can wear shoes that I like." This attitude towards customers is itself a communist service attitude.
      Salespeople must also dare to think and act
    Daring to think and act is a communist style, and this style is of great significance to salespeople.
    In the socialist Great Leap Forward, many things emerged that we had not thought of in the past. The advanced example of the Tiandi Bridge Shopping Mall's pioneering commercial Great Leap Forward and service attitude revolution is a model of salespeople daring to think and act. For example, sales mechanization and automation are the result of salespeople daring to think and act. Some people think that salespeople just sell goods and have neither knowledge nor learning. However, after the Great Leap Forward, many salespeople not only enthusiastically served customers, but also studied service methods. As a result, many subjects emerged that we had not studied in the past, such as customer psychology analysis, language art, sales skills, etc., and many books related to sales business have also been published. In short, in order to greatly improve the work of sales, adapt to the needs of social development, and improve our business skills and service quality, we must further study every link in the business activities, and in the process of research, we must have a communist style of daring to think and act in order to achieve the purpose of improvement and obtain the effect of research.
    The communist style of salespeople is manifested in many aspects. In reality work and life, it is far more specific and vivid than what we say, but in general, I think it can be simply said that the communist style of salespeople is the ideological and action performance of selfless and honest service to customers that is generated under the purpose of promoting the communist cause.
    Then how can we do this?
    At present, there are still some comrades who are not fully equipped. Whether in the treatment of customers or in the labor attitude, they are still mixed with some narrow old ideological consciousness to varying degrees. These old ideological consciousness are incompatible with our reality and must be opposed.
    In the great wave of socialist construction, everyone is consciously or unconsciously involved in this great wave. Under the impact of this great wave, people's ideological consciousness and mental outlook have been washed to varying degrees, but because some people are standing on the crest of the wave and some people are following at the tail of the wave, the degree of washing is different. In order to thoroughly cleanse ourselves ideologically, we must stand on the crest of the high tide of socialist construction, throw ourselves into the fiery struggle, exercise ourselves, transform ourselves, and turn ourselves into a new person.
    The communist style is established in this fiery production struggle of socialist construction, through exercising and transforming ourselves, discarding our old ideological consciousness. Salespeople must actively serve customers in sales and promote the great development of industrial and agricultural production. Only by standing on the crest of the great wave of socialist construction and promoting the high tide of socialist construction can we establish a communist style.

     售货员的共产主义风格
     哈尔滨市第七百货商店哲学小组学员、售货员  魏淑琴
    “商店就是买卖”、“售货员就是卖货”的时代已经过去了。“商店”和“售货员”的含义有了新的内容。“以商店为家”、“以顾客为友”的新风尚在蓬勃发展着。
    大跃进以来，在我们营业室里，顾客更多了。“不买东西，也来看看”，每一件新产品都吸引着顾客。每当我向顾客介绍一种祖国的新产品时，看到他们在柜台前的满意笑脸，总是感到无限幸福和骄傲。我深深感到不仅要做好推销工作，同时要作好宣传工作，使每一个到我们这里来的顾客，都能感到党的无限伟大，祖国在蒸蒸日上，前途无限宽广和美好。
    售货员的工作是在千百万顾客的面前进行的，售货员的劳动态度好，会使人感到快活、喜悦，体现出社会主义国家人与人之间的新的关系。反之，售货员的劳动态度不好，就会造成很坏的影响。售货员只有认清自己本身的作用和任务以及它的影响时，才能更正确地对待自己的劳动。为此我们现在有必要来研究售货员的共产主义风格问题。售货员应当有坚定的无产阶级世界观，树立忠实于人民的共产主义高尚风格。什么样才是共产主义风格呢？共产主义风格在具体工作中又体现在哪些方面呢？这就是我这篇文章要讨论的问题。但由于自己工作经验不多，又兼文化理论水平低，就很难达到研究的目的；何况共产主义风格的题目甚大，售货员的业务活动又很复杂，就更难谈好。现在我只就自己的一点粗浅看法，写出来供大家讨论。
      做个忠实的人民勤务员
    在社会主义社会中，每一个人都有一定的社会职务，只要这个职务是对无产阶级事业和人民有利的职务，那他所从事的工作就是为人民服务的工作。至于工种不同，那是社会分工不同。工人农民是直接创造产品价值的，售货员不直接创造产品价值，而是把工人农民所创造出来的产品送到消费者的手里。售货员服务的好坏，决定于售货员劳动观点的好坏，那就是有没有共产主义的劳动态度问题，是不是为广大人民利益服务，处处都为广大人民打算，为社会主义事业打算的问题。现在就让我们分别谈谈：
    第一，在服务过程中的劳动观点问题。售货员站在柜台前，不同于工人站在机器旁边。售货员站在柜台前，一天可以接待几百名顾客，也可以接待几十名，甚至仅仅接待几名顾客也可完满地结束这一天的工作，因为售货员接待的顾客多少并不能像工厂里的工人一样规定上定额。工人在生产过程当中要保证产品质量，可是售货员的服务质量，伸缩性很大，往往不能通过技术鉴定来衡量。比如：售货员可以一次拿四样商品给顾客看，可是拿出两样也行了；在同一时间可以接待四、五名顾客，可是一个一个接待也行了。正因为这样，作一个好售货员，就必须要有坚强的自觉的劳动观点，把自己的工作看成一种高尚的光荣的职责。比如在过去，售货员只管卖货；在整风时，同志们普遍的提高了政治思想觉悟，主动的提出一员变多员的口号，不仅是售货员，而且是党的政策宣传员、推销员、采购员、管理员，就连取送货也由售货员自己担任，有的还成了拉车能手和运输突击队员。这种积极的态度就是共产主义的劳动态度。与此相反的，则是“拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己挑轻的。一事当前，先替自己打算，然后再替别人打算。”（毛泽东选集，二卷，六五三页）这就不是共产主义劳动态度，也是我们必须反对的。
    第二，劳动要为人民造福。在旧社会的时候，劳动是为了个人吃饭，今天劳动是为了集体的更大更多的幸福，为无产阶级事业造福，为人民造福。在旧社会时，店员是为了资本家，商店为资本家所有，而今天商店则是我们自己的，那首先就必须要树立起一个以商店为家的思想。有的同志在劳动中兢兢业业，他们把商店管理得有条不紊，处处为商店打算，因为他们认识到，商店是人民的，是国家的，国家和人民把这很多的钱和物资交给我们掌握和管理，这是对我们最高的委托和信任。
    作为国家的主人翁，首先就必须树立起一切为国家，把商店的事看成是自己的事，把党的利益摆在个人利益之上，吃苦在前，享受在后。要像毛主席告诉我们那样作“一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”（毛泽东选集，二卷，六五四页）
      为生产服务为消费服务
    上边我们谈了售货员的工作本身就是服务，那么为谁服务呢？怎样服务才算是共产主义的服务观点呢？让我们分别讨论。
    1、工商一家。生产为了消费，要消费必须生产，消费能促进扩大再生产，再生产的目的就是为了更好地满足日益增长的消费需要。所以生产和消费是有机统一的两个部分。这种统一的关系是通过商业起作用的，所以把商业叫作“桥梁”、“纽带”。商业是销售部门，生产部门就是靠着销售部门的更好销售来扩大再生产的，而销售部门又是靠着生产部门的更好生产来满足自己的销售需要的，所以两者是互相依赖互相制约的关系；生产是为了消费，销售部门也是为消费服务，目的是一个。大跃进以后，工厂为了更好地帮助售货员了解和掌握商品性能，便派生产技师到商店来给售货员讲商品知识和其生产过程，而且好些售货员还拜工厂的老工人为师傅，并在这些老师傅的热心教导下，成了商业战线上的多面手，不仅掌握了商品性能，懂得了操作规程，而且还学会了划样、试作和修理等。商业战线为了使工业生产出的商品更适应消费需要，售货员在工作当中都随时随地把意见反映给生产部门，这便促使了商品生产的提高，这种工商的密切结合，已经成了一种普遍的新风尚。
    此外，商品进工厂，商品下车间，商品到田间已成为普通现象，甚至“夜间送货”、“随时用随时送到”等一切从便利生产需要出发的事例也很多。总之，所有这些都体现一种共产主义风格。那些单纯本位观点，不从生产出发，不从整体出发都是错误的。
    2、以顾客为友。售货员的服务对象即是广大人民，不管是来自城市，或是来自农村，不管是工人、农民、干部、学生、居民等等都是以顾客身份出现在售货员面前的。售货员对待来自各个方面的广大顾客必须同样热情地接待，决不能因为有的顾客不买东西，仅仅是来看一看，就用冷淡的态度对人。
    因为需要，才有销售，千方百计的扩大货源，也正是千方百计的满足需要。所以说扩大销售和满足需要是辩证的统一的。因此，售货员和顾客造成密切的友谊也是很自然的。每个售货员都要把顾客的需要看成是自己的事，并能体会到顾客的心理。当顾客没有买到自己所需要的商品的时候，售货员都要深深的感到这是自己没有尽到职责。
    当顾客有了困难的时候，售货员总是要千方百计地想办法去帮助解决。比如：当听到顾客反映没有时间到商店来买商品时，便把顾客所需要的商品记下来，利用个人休息时间，把商品送到顾客家里。又如：有的顾客来商店买一种所需要的商品，恰巧赶上我们这个商店销光了。怎么办呢？顾客等着用，又不知什么地方有，这时售货员就给他到处联系，联系到了告诉他去买。再比如，有的顾客曾因脚奇，几年来没有穿到自己可心的鞋而苦恼，我们的售货员知道了，便费尽心机地为这位顾客制作了一双，满足了需要，顾客高兴地说：“这回我可穿上可心鞋了”。这种对待顾客的态度本身就是一种共产主义的服务态度。
      售货员也要敢想敢干
    敢想敢干是共产主义风格，这种风格对售货员来说有很重要的意义。
    社会主义大跃进中，涌现了很多是我们过去所没有想到的事，天桥商场首创的商业大跃进和服务态度大革命的先进事例就是售货员敢想敢干的典范，例如售货机械化自动化正是售货员敢想敢干的结果。有些人认为售货员就是卖货，既没知识也没什么学问。可是大跃进以后，许许多多售货员不仅热情为顾客服务，而且还研究了服务方法，结果出现了很多是过去我们没有研究过的学问，如顾客心理分析，语言艺术，售货技巧等等，而且还出版了很多有关售货业务的书籍。总之，要想把售货的工作大大提高一步，适应社会发展的需要，提高自己的业务本领和服务质量，就必须进一步的研究业务活动中的各个环节，在研究的过程当中又必须有一种敢想敢干的共产主义风格，才能达到提高的目的和取得研究的效果。
    售货员的共产主义风格是表现在多方面的，在现实工作中和生活中，远远比我们说的具体得多，生动得多，但总的说来，我觉得可以简单地说：售货员的共产主义风格就是在为促进共产主义事业的目的下所产生的那种大公无私和坦白诚恳为顾客服务的思想和行动表现。
    那么怎样才能作到这一点呢？
    就目前说来，还有一些同志没有完全具备，不管在对待顾客上或者是在劳动态度上，还不同程度地夹杂着一些狭隘的旧的思想意识，这些旧的思想意识是与我们的现实格格不入的，也是我们必须反对的。
    在社会主义建设的大浪潮里，每个人都自觉或不自觉地卷入了这个大浪潮，在这个大浪潮的冲击下，人的思想意识和精神面貌在不同程度上都受到了刷洗，但由于有的人站在浪头，有的人跟在浪尾，所以刷洗的程度就有所不同。要想使自己在思想上受到彻底的清刷，就必须是站在社会主义建设高潮的浪头，必须投身于火热的斗争中，锻炼自己改造自己，把自己变成一个新的人。
    共产主义风格就是在这个社会主义建设的火热生产斗争中，通过锻炼改造抛弃其旧的思想意识而树立起来的。售货员必须在售货中积极为顾客服务，促进工农业生产的大发展，也只有站在社会主义建设的大浪头上，并促进这社会主义建设的高潮，才能树立起共产主义风格来。
