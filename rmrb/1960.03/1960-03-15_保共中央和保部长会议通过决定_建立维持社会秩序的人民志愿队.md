Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, March 13th: According to reports in local newspapers today, in order to gradually transfer some of the functions of state organs in maintaining social order to the social organizations of the working people, the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Bulgarian Council of Ministers have made a decision on the establishment of "Laboring People's Volunteer Corps for Maintaining Social Order" and have formulated temporary regulations on the tasks and activities of the volunteer corps.

The temporary regulations stipulate that the "Laboring People's Volunteer Corps for Maintaining Social Order" is a social organization voluntarily formed by the best workers, agricultural production cooperative members, state organ staff, students, etc., who are over the age of eighteen. Such organizations should be established in all enterprises, construction sites, government offices, schools, agricultural production cooperatives, state-owned farms, machine tractor stations, urban streets, and districts throughout the country. The task of the volunteer corps is to assist in maintaining social order during their spare time, to fight against acts that disrupt social order, and to participate in propaganda work to maintain the norms of socialist social behavior. The volunteer corps are led by the corresponding Party committees.

The Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee and the Bulgarian Council of Ministers pointed out in their decision that Bulgaria has made tremendous achievements in developing its economy and culture, that the class structure and social composition of Bulgarian society have undergone profound and fundamental changes, that the consciousness and political enthusiasm of the working people are constantly increasing, that the working people are increasingly and widely participating in the management of the country, and that socialist democracy has been further developed. Therefore, the resolution believes that in the future, the struggle against immoral and disruptive behavior should not only rely on state administrative organs, but also, and primarily, be carried out through methods in which the working people and social organizations widely participate in maintaining social order. This is considered possible.

    保共中央和保部长会议通过决定
    建立维持社会秩序的人民志愿队
    新华社索非亚13日电　据此间报纸今天报道：为了把国家机关在维持社会秩序方面的一些职能逐步转移给劳动人民的社会组织，保加利亚共产党中央委员会和保加利亚部长会议作出了关于建立“维持社会秩序劳动人民志愿队”的决定，并且制订出了志愿队的任务和活动临时章程。
    临时章程规定，“维持社会秩序劳动人民志愿队”是由年满十八岁以上的最好的工人、农业生产合作社社员、国家机关工作人员、学生等在自愿基础上组成的社会团体。全国各个企业、建筑工地、机关学校、农业生产合作社、国营农场、机器拖拉机站、城市街道和区都要建立这种团体。志愿队的任务是，在业余时间协助维持社会秩序，同破坏社会秩序的行为作斗争，并参加为了维护社会主义社会行为准则而进行的宣传工作。志愿队由相应的党的委员会领导。
    保共中央和保加利亚部长会议在决议中指出，保加利亚在发展经济和文化方面取得了巨大的成就，保加利亚社会的阶级构成和社会成分已经发生了深刻的根本的变化，劳动人民的觉悟和政治积极性不断提高，劳动人民日益广泛地参加国家的管理工作，社会主义民主有了进一步的发展。因此，决议认为，今后跟不道德的和破坏社会秩序的行为作斗争不仅要依靠国家行政机关，而且首先要通过劳动人民和社会团体广泛参加维持社会秩序工作的方法来进行，这样作是可能的。
