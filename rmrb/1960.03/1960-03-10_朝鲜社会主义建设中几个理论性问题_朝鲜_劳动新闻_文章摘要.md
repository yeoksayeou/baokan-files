     Several Theoretical Problems in North Korea's Socialist Construction
     Excerpts from an Article in the Korean "Rodong Sinmun"
    (1) The producer's consciousness is of decisive significance to the improvement of labor productivity. It is wrong to only emphasize adherence to the principle of material interests. The Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party attaches particular importance to ensuring that political work takes precedence over all other work. (2) The problem of studying within the entire party is an urgent requirement for the leap forward development of the Korean revolution. To continuously improve the party's leading role, the political and theoretical level of leading cadres must first be continuously improved. (3) The issue of agricultural mechanization is one of the most important issues in North Korea's socialist construction. The realization of mechanization will significantly increase agricultural productivity and maintain a balance between the development of industry and agriculture.
    The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial article on February 2nd entitled "Studying Several Theoretical Problems in the Documents of the December Plenary Session of the Korean Workers' Party," excerpts from which are as follows:
    The December 1959 Plenary Session discussed and decided on extremely important issues related to the buffer period - a period for preparing for battle to shift from one high ground of socialist construction to another higher high ground.
    In his historically significant speech at the plenary session, Comrade Kim Il-sung pointed out the historical basis for raising the tasks of the buffer period and its solutions, and theoretically clarified a series of important issues of principle in the process of socialist construction in our country. First, the role of the producer's consciousness in improving labor productivity.
    When people talk about improving labor productivity, they generally emphasize the strengthening of production technology and equipment, the improvement of workers' technical level, and the rational allocation of labor, but rarely talk about the producer's consciousness.
    Of course, no one can deny, nor should deny, that important factors in improving labor productivity are technical equipment, improved technical level, and rational allocation of labor.
    However, if only the above factors are emphasized and the role of the producer's consciousness is ignored, it is impossible to correctly understand the development of productive forces under the socialist system.
    In our country's situation, without considering the role of the high consciousness of the working people, it is impossible to propose correct methods for improving labor productivity, and it is impossible to understand the essence of our society's leap forward development.
    Comrade Kim Il-sung, based on the Marxist-Leninist clear concept of production and the experience of socialist construction in our country, made profound conclusions about improving labor productivity at the plenary session.
    Comrade Kim Il-sung said: "What is of decisive significance in improving labor productivity is the lofty idea of workers who are determined to dedicate all their energy and wisdom to the struggle for the motherland and the people, for their own happiness. When the political consciousness of the workers is improved, they will work harder to improve their technical level and will exert greater creativity, enthusiasm, and talent to tap all potential and possibilities for increasing production."
    This conclusion is first of all an important theoretical and practical judgment drawn from the experience of socialist construction in our country.
    In socialist society, in addition to material incentives for producers, there will be new incentives that could not be seen in past societies (even if they existed in the old society, they were extremely thin) - new incentives that strongly promote producers' productive desires and inventive spirit, and these are social-moral incentives.
    Social-moral incentives primarily depend on the revolutionary consciousness of the working masses, and the higher the level of revolutionary consciousness, the more vigorous the productive desires and inventiveness of producers motivated by social-moral motives.
    In the process of advancing towards socialism and communism, the role played by social-moral incentives is increasingly enhanced.
    The great Lenin repeatedly emphasized the significance of the revolutionary enthusiasm of the working people for the development of productive forces from the early stages of socialist construction.
    Lenin once taught that socialism must be built with the help of the revolutionary enthusiasm generated by the results of the October Revolution and on the basis of the material interests of the working people.
    Recently, when discussing socialist construction and the development of productive forces in articles and other publications, only the principle of adhering to material interests has been emphasized, while the issue of raising the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses has been neglected, which is obviously a wrong tendency.
    As Lenin clearly pointed out, Marxist-Leninist parties cannot rely solely on the principle of material interests, i.e., individual material incentives for the working people, in leading socialist construction.
    After the war, our country's productive forces have developed at an unprecedented leap forward pace, and the most important factor is that our Party Central Committee has believed in the revolutionary enthusiasm and inexhaustible creativity of our people and firmly relied on it, and has proposed bold fighting goals that are adapted to the political enthusiasm and creative enthusiasm of the masses.
    Our Party's policy of "continue to advance, continue to innovate" is based on the fact that the producer's consciousness plays a decisive role in developing productive forces and improving labor productivity.
    The producer's consciousness is of decisive significance to the improvement of labor productivity, so we must rely on and vigorously exert the role of this decisive factor. That is to say, we must do a good job of political work. Our Party Central Committee attaches particular importance to ensuring that political work takes precedence over all other work and to the issue of improving and strengthening political work. The resolution made by the Standing Committee of the Party Central Committee on August 28, 1959, and the series of important practical measures taken are by no means accidental.
    In the past, many party organizations and cadres neglected political work because they first of all failed to deeply recognize the role of the revolutionary consciousness of the working people as a prerequisite for the leap forward development of our country, and failed to recognize the practical significance of making political work take precedence.
    Comrade Kim Il-sung, in pointing out the role of consciousness, analyzed the shortcomings that arose in the process of implementing the 1959 national economic plan, saying: "One of the important mistakes made by our comrades this year is that they did not do a good job of political work aimed at improving labor productivity."
    We are faced with an important task: to continue to deeply study this thought and further concretize and develop it through theory and practice.
          Second, the issue of studying throughout the party
    Comrade Kim Il-sung has constantly emphasized the issue of improving the political and theoretical level of leading cadres, and at the December Plenary Session, he gave instructions on studying throughout the party.
    The issue of studying throughout the party is an urgent requirement for the leap forward development of our country's revolution. As everyone knows, the development of socialist society is by no means spontaneous, but relies on the conscious activities of the working masses. Under the leadership of the party, the working people develop productive forces in a planned way, and adapt to the development of productive forces, constantly changing production relations, and systematically changing and developing the superstructure. In this way, under the socialist system, the role of subjective factors in historical development is decisively enhanced. This first of all shows that in the process of moving towards socialism and communism, the party's leading role will inevitably be further enhanced. To continuously improve the party's leading role in the masses, the political and theoretical level of leading cadres must first be continuously improved. Therefore, all Marxist-Leninist parties constantly attach importance to the work of improving political and theoretical level.
    However, this alone does not explain why our party is currently emphasizing the issue of cadre study so much. This issue should be explained through the special circumstances caused by the leap forward development of our society.
    In the past three years, our country's productive forces have grown at an average annual rate of 44.6% in industrial production; in the four or five years after the war, the production relations in cities and rural areas have also completely become socialist production relations, and at the same time, they have been continuously completed. Correspondingly, the state management system is also being improved. This rapid change and development naturally requires a rapid improvement in the leadership level of leading cadres.
    However, it takes a certain amount of time to train cadres with political and professional abilities. Therefore, there is a certain distance between the speed of improvement in the political and theoretical level of our leading cadres and the speed of development of our society. In this way, many of our leading cadres cannot promptly understand the issues raised by the party and boldly implement and carry out work in their positions. Generally speaking, the commanding ability of our leading cadres lags behind the high political and labor enthusiasm of the masses.
    So, how to eliminate this distance? There must be special party-wide measures. While entering the buffer period, our party vigorously expanded the training system nationwide and took revolutionary measures for party-wide study.
    Comrade Kim Il-sung pointed out when talking about the study of party cadres under the urgent need to improve the political and professional level of leading cadres: "Studying is the work of the party."
    The problem now is: to keep up with the leap forward development of our country's revolutionary situation, to maintain the honor of being a labor party member, and to be loyal to the party, we must study.
    What occupies an important position in studying, especially in cadre study, is the study of Marxist-Leninist philosophy, political economy, and the party's line and policies.
    Comrade Kim Il-sung pointed out in his concluding speech at the December Plenary Session, "The entire party must study Marxism-Leninism. In order to be able to judge all things with materialist dialectics and correctly understand the laws of social development, we must study Marxist philosophy, and in order to grasp the laws of socialist economic development, we must study political economy."
    The most important issue in theoretical study is to focus on studying our party's theory on the Korean revolution, especially our party's theory on socialist revolution and socialist construction.
    The development of our country's revolution has many special conditions, so our party cannot but uniquely solve many problems in leading our country's revolution, and our party has always skillfully solved them. In this process, our party has made great contributions to the concretion and development of Marxist-Leninist theory.
    This is manifested in the lines and policies adopted by our party at each period, and has been clearly summarized in the party's various resolutions and Comrade Kim Il-sung's writings and speeches.
    Our task is to deeply study these documents, deeply understand the theoretical and practical issues raised in the documents, and implement them into practical work, improve leadership level, and systematically arm party members and the masses.
    If we do not do this and only limit ourselves to general theoretical study, we will inevitably fall into the quagmire of dogmatism.
    Third, issues related to agricultural mechanization and the organization of agricultural mechanized operations
    As Comrade Kim Il-sung pointed out, agricultural mechanization is not simply a way to solve the current problem of rural labor, but a historical task that must be solved in our country's socialist construction.
    Agricultural mechanization is not only a basic condition for significantly improving agricultural productivity and maintaining a balance between the development of industry and agriculture, but also a decisive factor in improving and changing the ideological consciousness and lifestyle of rural residents.
    Therefore, it is one of the most important issues raised in the entire socialist construction of our country.
    Comrade Kim Il-sung clearly pointed out the comprehensive and systematic program aimed at realizing this important issue, namely agricultural mechanization, at the plenary session, thereby creating another model of creatively applying Marxism-Leninism to the practice of socialist construction in our country and uniquely solving problems.
    A very important issue raised with agricultural mechanization is the issue of organizing agricultural mechanized operation stations.
    According to Comrade Kim Il-sung's proposal, the former agricultural machinery rental stations have been reorganized into agricultural mechanized operation stations. Agricultural mechanized operation stations are the base of rural technical revolution, and they will play an important role as a base for practically showing the rural residents the organization, consciousness, and advanced lifestyle of the working class.
    This measure not only changed its name, but also greatly enhanced its role.
    First of all, the former agricultural machinery rental stations mainly engaged in plowing and played a supplementary role in agricultural production; agricultural mechanized operation stations will be responsible for various operations such as plowing, sowing, cultivating, weeding, transportation, and land leveling, and it will play a decisive role in agricultural production work.
    Secondly, in terms of economic relations, agricultural mechanized operation stations will play a different role from agricultural machinery rental stations, which is also a very important issue. The former agricultural machinery rental stations did not bear any economic responsibility for agricultural production. Agricultural mechanized operation stations will be economically responsible for agricultural production, have economic interests in actual output, and will participate in product distribution through their labor quantity and quality. Comrade Kim Il-sung pointed out when talking about this principle of agricultural mechanized operation stations, "In the future, if the harvest is good, the staff of the agricultural mechanized operation station will get a larger share; conversely, if the harvest is not good, the income of the staff of the agricultural mechanized operation station will be affected to some extent."
    This is a wise and important measure that adapts to the current situation, improves the connection between the production activities of the working class and the farmers of agricultural cooperatives in rural areas, improves the distribution of agricultural products in rural areas, thereby giving new impetus to the development of rural productive forces.

     朝鲜社会主义建设中几个理论性问题
     朝鲜“劳动新闻”文章摘要
    （一）生产者的觉悟对劳动生产率的提高具有决定性意义。只强调遵守物质利益的原则是错误的，朝鲜劳动党中央特别重视使政治工作走在一切工作前面。（二）全党学习问题是朝鲜革命飞跃发展的迫切要求。为了不断提高党的领导作用，首先就要不断地提高领导干部的政治理论水平。（三）农业机械化问题是朝鲜社会主义建设中最重要的问题之一，实现机械化将显著提高农业生产力，并使工业和农业的发展保持平衡。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”2月2日发表一篇编辑局文章，题目是：“研究朝鲜劳动党十二月全会文件中的几个理论性问题”，摘要如下：
    1959年12月全会讨论并决定了有关缓冲期——为从社会主义建设的一个高地转移到另一个更高的高地而进行战斗准备的时期——各项任务的极其重要的问题。
    金日成同志在全会上的具有历史意义的发言中，指出了缓冲期任务之所以被提出来的历史根据和它的解决方法，并从理论上阐明了在我国社会主义建设过程中的一系列带有原则性的重要问题。一，生产者的觉悟在提高劳动生产率中的作用问题
    人们在谈到提高劳动生产率的时候，一般地着重强调生产技术装备的加强、劳动者的技术水平的提高、劳动力的合理调配等，而几乎没有谈到生产者的觉悟。
    当然，谁也不能否认而且也不应否认：在提高劳动生产率方面的重要因素，是技术装备、技术水平的提高、劳动力的合理调配等。
    但是，如果只是强调上述因素，忽视生产者的觉悟的作用，就不可能正确地理解在社会主义制度下的生产力的发展。
    在我国情况下，不把劳动人民的高度觉悟的作用考虑进去，就不可能提出提高劳动生产率的正确方法，不可能理解我国社会飞跃发展的本质。
    金日成同志在全会上，根据马克思列宁主义关于生产的明确概念和我国社会主义建设的经验，作了关于提高劳动生产率的深刻的结论。
    金日成同志说：“在提高劳动生产率方面具有决定性意义的是：为祖国和人民，为自己的幸福而决心献出自己的一切精力和智慧来进行斗争的工人们的崇高的思想。当工人们的政治觉悟得到提高的时候，他们就会更加努力提高自己的技术水平，就会发挥更大的创造性、热情和才能来挖掘一切增产潜力和可能性。”
    这一结论，首先是从我国社会主义建设经验中得到的具有重要理论和实践意义的论断。
    在社会主义社会里，除了对生产者的物质刺激外，还会产生在过去的社会中所不能见到的刺激（在旧社会即使有也是极其稀薄的）——强有力地推动生产者的生产欲望和发明创造精神的新的刺激，这就是社会—道德的刺激。
    社会—道德的刺激，首先取决于劳动群众的革命觉悟，并且革命觉悟水平越高，出于社会—道德动机的生产者的生产欲望和发明创造性就越高涨。
    在向社会主义、共产主义前进的过程中，社会—道德的刺激所起的作用日益提高。
    伟大的列宁从社会主义建设初期就一再强调劳动人民的革命热情对生产力发展所具有的意义。
    列宁曾经教导：必须在十月革命的结果所产生的革命热情的帮助下，并在劳动人民的物质利益的基础上，建设社会主义。
    近来，在文章和其它刊物中谈论社会主义建设、生产力发展的时候，只是强调遵守物质利益的原则，却忽视了提高群众的革命热情的问题，这显然是错误的倾向。
    正如列宁所明确指出的，马克思列宁主义政党在领导社会主义建设中，不能仅仅依靠物质利益的原则，即劳动人民个人的物质刺激。
    战后，我国生产力有了空前飞跃的发展，其最重要因素，在于我们党中央确信我国人民的革命热情和无穷无尽的创造力，并坚定地依靠它，提出了适应于群众的政治热情和创造热情的大胆的奋斗目标。
    我们党的“继续前进、继续革新”的方针，就是从生产者的觉悟在发展生产力、提高劳动生产率方面起决定作用这一点出发而提出来的。
    生产者的觉悟对劳动生产率的提高具有决定性意义，因此我们要依靠并大力地发挥这一决定性因素的作用。这就是说，我们要做好政治工作。我们党中央委员会特别重视使政治工作走在一切工作的前面，重视改进和加强政治工作的问题。1959年8月28日党中央常务委员会作出的决议和采取一系列重要的实践性措施，决不是偶然的。
    在过去时期，有不少党组织和干部忽视了政治工作，其原因在于：他们首先没有深入地认识到我国革命飞跃发展的前提条件——劳动人民革命觉悟的作用，没有认清使政治工作先行的实际意义。
    金日成同志在指出觉悟的作用时，分析了在1959年国民经济计划执行过程中所产生的缺点，他说：“今年，我们的同志所犯的重要错误之一是：他们没有做好旨在提高劳动生产率的政治工作。”
    在我们面前摆着这样一个重要任务：继续深入地研究这一思想，并通过理论和实践把它进一步具体化和发展起来。
          二，全党学习的问题
    金日成同志经常不断地强调提高领导干部的政治理论水平问题，并且在十二月全会上又作了关于全党学习的指示。
    全党学习的问题是我国革命飞跃发展的迫切要求。大家知道，社会主义社会的发展，决不是自发的，而是要依靠劳动群众的有意识的活动。劳动人民在党的领导下，有计划地发展生产力，并适应生产力的发展，不断地改变生产关系，系统地改变和发展上层建筑。这样，在社会主义制度下，历史发展的主观因素的作用就得到决定性的提高。这首先说明，在向社会主义、共产主义迈进的过程中，党的领导作用必然得到进一步提高。要想不断地提高党在群众中的领导作用，首先就要不断地提高领导干部的政治理论水平。所以，所有的马克思列宁主义政党，都经常重视提高政治理论水平的工作。
    但是，仅仅这一点还说明不了目前我们党为什么那样强调干部的学习问题。这个问题，应该通过我国社会飞跃发展所造成的特殊情况来加以说明。
    最近三年来，我国生产力在工业生产方面每年平均增长了44．6％；在战后四、五年中，城市和农村的生产关系也完全变成了社会主义生产关系，同时它还不断地完整起来。与此相适应，国家管理体制也正在健全起来。这种飞快的变化和发展，当然要求飞快地提高领导干部的领导水平。
    但是，培养有政治、业务能力的干部，需要一定的时间。因而，在我们领导干部的政治理论水平的提高速度和我国社会发展速度之间，就有了一定的距离。这样，我们的不少领导干部就不能及时领会党所提出的问题，并在自己的岗位上大胆地贯彻和开展工作。一般地说，我们领导干部的指挥能力落后于群众的高昂的政治、劳动热情。
    那么，如何消除这种距离呢？要有全党性的特别措施。我们党在进入缓冲期的同时，在全国范围内大力扩大了训练体制，采取了全党学习的革命措施。
    金日成同志在迫切需要提高领导干部的政治业务水平的条件下谈到党的干部的学习问题时指出：“学习就是党的工作。”
    现在的问题是：要想赶上飞跃发展的我国革命形势，要想保持劳动党员的荣誉，忠于党，就要进行学习。
    在学习特别是干部的学习中占重要地位的，是对马克思列宁主义哲学、政治经济学和党的路线、政策的学习。
    金日成同志在十二月全会上的总结发言中指出，“全党都要学习马克思列宁主义。为了能够用唯物辩证法去判断一切事物，正确认识社会发展规律，必须学习马克思主义的哲学，并且为了掌握社会主义经济的发展规律，必须学习政治经济学。”
    在理论学习中最重要的问题是：把中心目标放在学习我们党所拟定的关于朝鲜革命的理论，特别是我们党关于社会主义革命和社会主义建设的理论上。
    我国革命发展具有很多特殊条件，因而我们党在领导我国革命中不能不独特地解决很多问题，并且我们党一直是熟练地解决了它们。在这一过程中，我们党对马克思列宁主义理论的具体化和发展，作出了很大贡献。
    这从我们党在每个时期所采取的路线和政策中表现出来，并且在党的各项决议和金日成同志的著作、演说中已经明确地概括了它。
    我们的任务在于：深入地研究这些文件，深入地理解文件中提出的理论和实践性的问题，并把它贯彻到实际工作中去，提高领导水平，同时系统地武装党员群众。
    如果不这样作而仅仅局限于一般的理论学习，就难免要陷入教条主义的泥坑里去。
    三，有关农业机械化和组织农业机械作业所的问题
    正如金日成同志所指出的，农业机械化不是单纯地解决当前农村劳动力问题的途径，而是在我国社会主义建设中必须加以解决的历史任务。
    农业机械化不但是显著地提高农业生产力，使工业和农业的发展保持平衡的基本条件，而且是提高和改变农村居民的思想意识和生活方式的决定性因素。
    因此，它是在我国整个社会主义建设中被提出的最重要问题之一。
    金日成同志在全会上明确地指出了旨在实现这一重要问题，即农业机械化的全面而又有体系的纲领，从而作出了把马克思列宁主义创造性地运用到我国社会主义建设的实践中来，并独特地解决问题的又一个典范。
    随着农业机械化而提出来的非常重要的问题，是农业机械化作业所的组织问题。
    按照金日成同志的提议，从前的农业机器代耕站已改组成为农业机械作业所。农业机械作业所是农村技术革命的基点，它将作为通过实际向农村居民显示工人阶级的组织性、觉悟性和先进生活品德的基点发挥重要作用。
    这个措施不仅更换了它的名称，而且大大提高了它的作用。
    首先，从前的农业机器代耕站主要是从事翻耕，在农业生产中起补助作用；农业机械作业所却要负责翻耕、播种、中耕、除草、运输、平整土地等各种作业，它将在农业生产工作中起决定性作用。
    其次，在经济关系上，农业机械作业所将会起不同于农业机器代耕站的作用，这也是非常重要的问题。从前的农业机器代耕站对农业生产没有负什么经济上的责任。农业机械作业所则要从经济上负责农业生产，对实际产量发生经济利害关系，并将通过自己的劳动数量和质量来参加产品分配。金日成同志谈到农业机械作业所的这种原则时指出，“今后，如果收成好，农业机械作业所工作人员将要取得的份额就会多；相反，如果收成不好，农业机械作业所工作人员的收入就要受到某种程度的影响。”
    这是适应当前的形势，改善农村中的工人阶级和农业社农民间的生产活动上的联系，改善农村中的农产品分配，从而给农村生产力的发展以新的刺激的英明而重要的措施。
