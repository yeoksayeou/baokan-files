People's Daily, Taiyuan, March 6th. The Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has formulated a plan to carry out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, organizing the city's workers to launch a high tide of mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations.

According to the requirements of this plan, by the end of the second quarter of this year, the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in Taiyuan City will increase from about 42% last year to 65% to 70%, the city's annual labor productivity will increase by 50% compared to last year, and efforts will be made to ensure that existing production units increase production without increasing personnel, saving 40,000 to 50,000 laborers to support new construction units. Now, after two battles, the city's workers have already made great achievements in realizing the plan. The degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization in the city has increased to 60%, and more than 32,000 laborers have been saved.

As early as the end of last year, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party foresaw that Taiyuan's industrial production tasks this year would increase significantly compared to last year, and the trial production and mass production tasks of new products would also be very heavy. More than 200 newly built factories, mines, and workshops in the city would be put into production one after another. In completing these tasks, a series of new problems would inevitably be encountered, the most prominent of which was the contradiction between the large increase in production tasks and the large proportion of manual operations and very low labor productivity. At that time, according to preliminary statistics, various units requested more than 70,000 additional people to complete the increased production tasks in 1960. The Municipal Committee believed that this right-leaning conservative thinking of simply increasing production by adding workers must be resolutely overcome. The Municipal Committee organized various enterprises to conduct in-depth investigations and found that the proportion of manual operations in the city's major factories and mines still accounted for more than half. Even in some modern large-scale enterprises, there were problems such as low equipment utilization rates. The Municipal Committee pointed out that all of these were huge potential labor reserves within the enterprises, and that carrying out technical innovation and technical revolution movements, and vigorously promoting mechanization and semi-mechanization of manual operations, could fully tap the potential within these enterprises and ensure the continuous leap forward in production. Immediately afterwards, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, at its plenary expanded meeting held in December last year, passed the "Resolution on Carrying Out the Technical Innovation and Technical Revolution Movement Centered on Mechanization and Semi-Mechanization."

This resolution made a comprehensive plan for the city's technical innovation and technical revolution movement.

The resolution also put forward clear innovation goals for various types of enterprises: First, all those using manual operations should vigorously promote semi-mechanization and mechanization, especially to seize the opportunity to reduce and even eliminate heavy physical labor in mining, crushing, forging, riveting, loading, and unloading; basic construction departments should highlight the mechanization of earth excavation and transportation. Second, those who have already achieved semi-mechanization should strive to achieve mechanization, using electricity as power; those who have already achieved partial mechanization should strive to achieve overall mechanization; those with a high degree of mechanization should strive to achieve semi-automation, and develop towards automation, continuity, combination, and high speed. Third, fully utilize existing equipment and improve equipment utilization rates. Newly built and expanded modern factories and mines should train workers to master technology, and change the past phenomenon of having equipment idle on the one hand, while using manual operations and wasting a lot of labor on the other hand. Fourth, widely mobilize the masses to improve process operations, adopt new processes, and improve tools and equipment. Fifth, systematically summarize and promote some effective and universally significant advanced experiences based on the characteristics of the industry, the enterprise, and various types of work.

The plan also made a series of provisions for carrying out the technical innovation and technical revolution movement. The plan pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the Party and vigorously promote mass movements; it is necessary to concentrate efforts to first realize those key projects that cost less, are easy to implement, have great effects, and are urgently needed in production, and fully mobilize the masses to carry out innovations without spending money or spending less money, using waste materials, old materials, old equipment, or stagnant materials; it is necessary to implement the "walking on two legs" policy, and according to needs and possibilities, use foreign methods if possible, and use indigenous methods if foreign methods are not possible, and combine self-reliance as the main principle with national investment and mutual cooperation, and combine the transformation of old equipment with the addition of new equipment.

After the comprehensive plan was formulated, the Taiyuan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party adopted a method of phased operations to realize the plan. Now, two battles have been organized successively. The main attack target of the first battle was manual operations, heavy physical labor, and places with a large number of people. In this battle, the masses invented and created a large number of machines. At the beginning of the second battle, the Party committees of various enterprises promptly paid attention to quickly matching these scattered machines according to the type of work, making them a "one-stop" production line for mechanized operations, so that the innovative machines could fully play their role. Many enterprises carried out surprise attacks on weak operating processes in the matching process, and then developed towards the overall technical transformation of the entire enterprise and the entire industry.

In realizing the plan for technical innovation and technical revolution movement, Taiyuan City widely carried out technical competition activities. The Taiyuan Municipal Committee also widely organized cooperation, so that the plan could be quickly implemented.

Now, after two battles, factories, mines, and enterprises in Taiyuan City have manufactured a large number of indigenous and foreign machines, so that the types of work and work sections in many units have basically realized mechanization and semi-mechanization. The city has also seen 408 semi-automatic and automatic machine tools, and realized 47 automatic and linked production lines.

### 全面规划　加强领导　把技术革新运动推上新阶段  太原制定技术革新规划  全市机械化和半机械化程度很快提高18％，节省出三万多人支援新建单位

    全面规划　加强领导　把技术革新运动推上新阶段
    太原制定技术革新规划
    全市机械化和半机械化程度很快提高18％，节省出三万多人支援新建单位
    本报太原6日电  中共太原市委制订了开展技术革新和技术革命运动的规划，组织全市职工掀起了手工操作机械化和半机械化的高潮。
    根据这个规划的要求，到今年第二季度底，太原市机械化和半机械化的程度将由去年的42％左右提高到65％至70％，全年的劳动生产率将比去年提高50％，并力争原有生产单位增产不增人，节省出四万到五万个劳动力，支援新建单位。现在，经过两次战役，全市职工已经在实现规划方面取得很大成绩。全市机械化和半机械化程度已经提高到60％，并且节省出三万二千多个劳动力。
    早在去年年底，中共太原市委就预见到太原市今年的工业生产任务将比去年有很大增长，新产品的试制和成批生产任务也很繁重，全市还有二百多个新建的厂矿、车间要陆续投入生产。在完成这些任务中必然会碰到一连串新问题，其中最突出的是生产任务大量增加和手工操作比重很大、劳动生产率很低的矛盾。当时，据初步统计，各单位为了完成1960年增加的生产任务，就要求增加七万余人。市委认为，这种单靠增加工人来增加生产的右倾保守思想必须坚决克服。市委组织各企业进行了深入的调查摸底，发现全市手工操作的比重在主要厂矿中还占到一半以上，在一些现代化的大型企业中，也存在着设备利用率不高等问题。市委指出，所有这些都是企业内部巨大的劳动潜力所在，开展技术革新和技术革命运动，大搞手工操作机械化和半机械化，完全可能把这些企业内部的潜力挖掘出来，保证生产的持续跃进。紧接着，中共太原市委在去年12月举行的全体扩大会议上，通过了“关于开展以机械化、半机械化为中心的技术革新和技术革命运动的决议”。
    这个决议对全市的技术革新和技术革命运动进行了全面规划。
    决议中并对各个不同类型的企业提出了明确的革新目标：一、凡是使用手工操作的，要大搞半机械化、机械化，特别是要抓紧减轻以至消灭采掘、破碎、锻铆、装卸等方面的笨重体力劳动；基本建设部门要突出地抓挖土方和运输等环节的机械化。二、已经实现半机械化的，力争实现机械化，用电力作动力；已经实现局部机械化的力争实现全盘机械化；机械化程度较高的力争实现半自动化，并向自动化、连续化、组合化和高速化的方向发展。三、充分利用现有设备，提高设备利用率。新建和扩建的现代化厂矿，要训练工人掌握技术，改变过去那种一方面有设备闲置不用，而另一方面又使用手工操作，浪费大量劳动力的现象。四、广泛发动群众改进工艺操作，采用新工艺，改进工具设备。五、根据本行业、本企业和各个工种的特点，系统地总结推广一些行之有效的和带有普遍意义的先进经验。
    对于开展技术革新和技术革命运动的做法，规划中也做了一系列的规定。规划指出，必须加强党的领导，大搞群众运动；必须集中力量首先实现那些花钱少、容易搞、效果大、见效快、在生产上迫切需要的关键项目，充分发动群众不花钱或少花钱，利用废料、旧料、旧设备或呆滞物资来搞革新；必须贯彻“两条腿走路”方针，根据需要和可能，能洋就洋，不能洋就土，并以自力更生为主，国家投资和相互协作相结合，改造旧设备和添制新设备相结合。
    全面规划制订以后，中共太原市委采取分段作战的方法来实现这个规划。现在，已先后组织了两个战役，第一个战役的主攻目标是手工操作、笨重体力劳动和占人较多的地方。在这个战役中，群众发明创造出大量的机具。第二战役一开始，各企业党委就及时注意把这些零星的机具，按工种迅速配套，成为机械化作业“一条龙”生产，使革新机具充分发挥了作用。许多企业在配套中针对薄弱的操作过程进行突击，然后向整个企业、整个行业的全面技术改造发展。
    在实现技术革新和技术革命运动的规划时，太原市广泛开展了技术比武活动。太原市委还广泛组织协作，使规划得以迅速贯彻。
    现在，经过两个战役，太原市各厂矿企业就制成了大批土洋机械，使许多单位的工种、工段基本实现了机械化、半机械化。全市还出现了四百零八部半自动化、自动化机床，实现了四十七条自动和联动的生产线。
