Let Tools Also Become "Multi-Talented"
　　Yang Ling

　　“Combined Rolling, Harrowing, Leveling, Tilling, and Ridge-Making Machine,” “Sowing, Fertilizing, and Cultivating Implement,”… In the technical reform movement in agriculture, many such new terms have emerged. There are also some tools that simply cannot be named. Originally a "three-tooth weeding hoe," with a slight change of parts, it becomes a cotton planter; without much change, it can be used for fertilization; with a little more modification, it can be used to plant wheat, and then it can be used to weed wheat. Originally a "double-wheeled double-铧犁," with changes in structure and parts, it becomes a sowing and fertilizing machine; after further modification, it becomes a simple harvester. "One tool for multiple uses, busy all year round" is a new phenomenon in China's agricultural mechanization and tool reform movement, and it is a new phenomenon with great development prospects.

　　One of the important characteristics of the People's Commune is its wide scope of operation. The direction of rural economic development in the new stage of socialist construction in our country is comprehensive management. Agricultural machinery and tool reform must adapt to this characteristic and this direction, that is, strive for comprehensive utilization. In the People's Commune, the development direction of people is "multi-talented," and the development direction of machinery and tools should also be "multi-talented." Since a person's hands can do many things, why can't a machine or a tool also do many things? However, in the past, many agricultural machines and tools only worked for a few months a year, and afterwards, they had to be carefully kept. Isn't this also a huge waste of productive forces! The performance of machinery and tools is given to them by the laborers. Laborers must control things, and cannot just be passively controlled by things. The People's Commune implements comprehensive management, with agriculture and industry going hand in hand, planting and breeding going hand in hand, plus the consideration of collective production and collective life, which opens up infinitely broad roads for the comprehensive utilization of various machines and tools - not only can they be comprehensively utilized within the scope of agricultural production, but also in a wider range of production and even welfare undertakings. This can save the labor and materials needed to manufacture machines and tools, greatly accelerate the mechanization of manual labor, and use the saved manpower and material resources to do more things. However, "one tool for multiple uses" has even more far-reaching significance: the "multi-talented" of people can promote the development of machinery and tools towards the "multi-talented" aspect; the "multi-talented" of machinery and tools can also make it easier for people to become "multi-talented." Once a person learns to master one machine and tool, he can learn to do many kinds of work, and he can exert his strength and wisdom more comprehensively and flexibly. This is greatly beneficial to the emergence and growth of comprehensively developed new communist people.

　　Here is a question of the relationship between "specialization" and "versatility." This issue should be viewed dialectically. "Specialization" and "versatility" are contradictory, but also interconnected. For people, without expertise, they cannot work skillfully, meticulously, and deeply, which is not conducive to improving work efficiency; however, if they are only specialized and not versatile, the foundation of specialization is narrow, and the height that can be reached is limited. The same is true for machinery and tools. A machine or tool can achieve higher efficiency only if its application has a certain object and a certain range; however, if there must be a special machine or tool for every task, it will cost much more manpower and material resources, and it will be inconvenient to master and use, and overall, it will not be able to achieve the highest efficiency. The comprehensive utilization of machinery and tools is actually to understand and transform things according to the objective laws of things. Things have both commonality and individuality, and they are both different and interconnected. Within a certain range, grasp the common points of multiple operations, and make the "skeleton" of the machine or tool; then, according to the different points of various operations, equip it with diverse "parts," so that we can fully use the commonality of things and fully exert the individuality of things, unify the two contradictory aspects, and promote the development of things in solving contradictions. Blindly pursuing "specialization," seeing only the individuality and differences of things, and not seeing the commonality and correlation of things, is a one-sidedness in thinking methods. The development of productive forces requires people's thinking to be liberated from the shackles of this one-sidedness.

### 让工具也成为“多面手”

    让工具也成为“多面手”
    杨岭
    “轧、耙、平、整、筑畦联合机”，“播种、施肥、中耕器”，……在农业的技术改革运动中，出现了许多这样的新名词。还有一些工具，简直就没法给它起名字了。本来是“三齿耘锄”，稍为改换一下零件，变成了棉花播种器；不用再怎么大变，又可以用来施肥；再稍改装一下，又可以用来种麦子，然后又能够用来锄麦子。本来是“双轮双铧犁”，结构、零件变动一下，成了播种、施肥机械；再改装一下，又变成了简易收割机。“一具多用，四季不闲”，这是我国农业机械化和工具改革运动中出现的新事物，是大有发展前途的新事物。
    人民公社的重要特点之一，就是经营范围广。我国社会主义建设新阶段的农村经济的发展方向，是综合经营。农业机械和工具改革，必然要同这个特点、这个方向相适应，也就是要力求综合利用。在人民公社里，人的发展方向是“多面手”，机具的发展方向也应该是“多面手”。一个人的一双手既然能做许多种事情，一种机器、一种工具为什么不可以也做许多种事情呢？可是，在过去，不少农业机械和工具却是一年只干几个月的活，过后，还得好好保管它们。这岂不也是对生产力的巨大浪费！机具的性能是劳动者给予它们的。劳动者一定要支配物，而不能只是被动地受物的支配。人民公社实行综合经营，农业和工业同时并举，种植业和养殖业并举，再加上集体生产和集体生活兼顾，这些就为各种机械和工具的综合利用开辟了无限广阔的道路——不只在农业生产范围内可以综合利用，而且在更多样的生产以至生活福利事业的范围内都可以综合利用。这样做，可以节约制造机械和工具所需要的劳动力和物资，可以大大加快手工劳动机械化的速度，并且可以用节约的人力物力做更多的事情。但是，“一具多用”还有更为深远的意义：人的“多面手”可以促进机械和工具向“多面手”方面发展；机械和工具的“多面手”也可以使人更便于成为“多面手”。一个人学会掌握一种机械和工具，就可以学会做许多种工作，就可以更多面、更灵活地发挥自己的力量和智慧。这大大有利于全面发展的共产主义新人的产生和成长。
    这里有一个“专”（专业化）与“通”（多面手）的关系问题。对这个问题应当辩证地看待。“专”与“通”是矛盾的，又是互相连系的。对于人来说，没有专长，就不能熟练地、精细地、深入地进行工作，不利于提高工作效率；可是，只专不通，专的基础狭窄，能达到的高度也就有限。机械和工具也是如此。一种机具的应用有一定的对象、一定的范围，才能达到较高的效率；可是，如果每一件事情都要有一种特别的机具，就要多费许多人力物力，而且不便掌握运用，总起来说，就也不能达到最高的效率。机具的综合利用，实际上就是按照事物的客观规律来认识事物、改造事物。事物都有共性和个性，都是互相区别而又互相关联。在一定的范围内，掌握多种操作的共同之点，做成机具的“骨架”；再按照各种操作的不同之点，配以多样的“零件”，这样，就可以做到既充分运用事物的共性，又充分发挥事物的个性，把矛盾的两个方面统一起来，在解决矛盾中推动事物的发展。一味追求“专门化”，只见事物的个性和区别，不见事物的共性和关联，那是思想方法上的片面性。生产力的发展，要求人们的思想从这种片面性的束缚中解放出来。
